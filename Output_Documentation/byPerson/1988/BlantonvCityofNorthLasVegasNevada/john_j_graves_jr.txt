mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
blanton
and
fraley
were
arrested
and
charged
with
driving
under
the
influence
in
the
city
of
north
las
vegas,
nevada,
in
july
and
june,
respectively,
of
1986.
blanton
made
a
written
demand
for
a
jury
trial
in
the
municipal
court,
and
that
demand
was
denied.
we
took
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
mandamus
to
the
district
court,
our
court
of
general
jurisdiction,
and
that
request
was
denied.
and
we
took
an
appeal
to
the
nevada
supreme
court.
mr.
fraley,
in
the
north
las
vegas
municipal
court
made
a
written
demand
for
a
jury
trial
that
was
denied.
he
entered
a
plea
of
guilty
to
the
charge.
he
took
an
appeal
of
trial
de
novo
to
the
district
court
and
the
demand
for
a
jury
trial
was
granted.
from
that
granting
of
the
demand
for
a
jury
trial,
the
city
of
north
las
vegas
took
an
original
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
nevada
supreme
court.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
no,
sir,
they
did
not.
the
nevada
supreme
court
construed
the
baldwin
case
rather
strictly,
wouldn't
we...
woodenly
we
think,
and
stated
that
the
baldwin
standard
of
six
months
and
$500
was
the
only
standard
that
it
would
stand
on.
and
as
a
result
of
that,
the
request
for
a
jury
trial
in
driving
under
the
influence
cases
was
denied.
in
its
decision
it
also
indicated
certain
policy
reasons.
part
of
this
was
expense
of
the
jury
trials,
general
inconvenience
in
rural
areas,
non-lawyer/judge
problems.
and
it
finally
concluded
by
suggesting
that
it
was
up
to
the
legislature
to
resolve
this
problem.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it
was
$1,000,
but
it--
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
--sir?
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
no,
sir.
the
$1,000
fine
has
been
in
the
law
in
the
state
of
nevada
for
several
years
now,
but
i
think
that
in
most
of
the
lower
court
cases
i
believe
that
the
fine
of
$500
has
been
abandoned
by
most
of
the
courts.
i
think
even
in
this
court.
i
think
in
muniz
v.
hoffman
you
indicate
that
it's
not
talismanic.
so--
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
--it
was
partially
wooden,
yes,
your
honor.
all
right.
as
this
court
knows,
this
country
is
at
war
with
drunk
drivers.
in
the
state
of
nevada
that
offensive
has
taken
this
shape.
upon
conviction
of
a
first
offense,
there
is
a
mandatory
fine
of
$200
and
a
maximum
of
$1,000.
there
is
a
mandatory
incarceration
of
two
days
or
48
hours
of
community
service
while
dressed
in
distinctive
garb
identifying
the
person
as
a
dui
violator.
and
with
the
permission
of
the
chief
justice
and
the
court
i
would
ask
to
be
able
to
show
you
this
distinctive
garb
here
today.
it
has
been
described
in
our
brief
at
pages
14
and
15.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
thank
you.
this
is
the
front
of
it.
it
looks
much
like
a
prisoner's
uniform.
property
of
north
las
vegas
court.
we
received
the
permission
of
the
city,
by
the
way
to
leave
this
with
the
court.
on
the
back
is
a
rather
large
circle,
dui
offender,
with
a
skull
and
crossbones
and
a
bottle
of
liquor
with
it
looks
like
a
hatch
mark
thing...
you,
you
can't...
you
can't
drink.
not
exactly
a
designer,
but--
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
--for
48
hours,
sir.
it's
not
as
if
it
were
just
two
days,
but
it
says--
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
--no,
sir.
you'd
want
to
stay
at
home
with
this.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
you
wear
it
in
the
community
where
you're
working
the
48
hours
of
community
service.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
it's
actually
like
six
eight-hour
days
or
eight
six-hour
days.
it's
actually
48
hours.
it's
not
like
two
eight-hour
days.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
so,
while
you're
working
typing
or
whether
you're
sweeping
the
road
or
whether
you're
sweeping
a
hall
in
a
public
building--
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
--no,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
most
of
my
clients
want
to
go
the
jail
time.
they
don't
want
to
be
caught--
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
--not
for
six
months,
but
for
the
two
days.
first
offenders
normally
don't
go
to
jail
for
six
months.
they'll...
normally
just
the
minimum--
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
--i'm
not
sure
that
this
is
a
more
severe
penalty
than
six
months
in
jail.
i
think
that--
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
well,
it's
our
position
that...
i'm
not
sure
that
we
can
make
that
analogy
exactly,
your
honor,
because
most
of
the
time
in
most
of
the
offenses
that
i
have
anything
to
do
with,
it's
two
days
in
jail
or
the
48
hours
wearing
this
particular
uniform.
xxx.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it
is
the
choice
of
the
defendant
generally.
the
courts
would
prefer...
most
courts...
it's
a
mixed
bag.
some
of
the
courts
have
said
that
they
are
going
to
make
the
choice
and
the
defendant
will
do
the
community
service
because
they
would
rather
have
the
defendant
out
in
the
community
working
as
opposed
to
sitting
in
jail.
and
that's
the
decision
that
most
of
the
courts
make,
although
sometimes
the
defendant
can
make
a
choice
of
going
to
jail
for
two
days.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
that
would
be
a
little
bit
closer
case.
i
think
that
this
is
a
badge
of
dishonor.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
if
this
was
the
only
penalty
and
you
had
to
wear
that
for
two
days?
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
no,
sir.
you've
got
a
mandatory
minimum
fine
of
$200
up
to
$1,000.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
that
would
be
a
closer
case.
that
might
entitle
to
us
to
a
jury
trial.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
because
it's
just...
it's,
it's
just
something
that
most
of
my
clients
don't
want
to
be
seen
in,
and
it's
a
badge
of
dishonor.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
not
always,
sir.
the
courts
are
split
on
that.
sometimes
a
judge
will
require
the
defendant
to
do
community
service.
sometimes--
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
--it
just
has
an
option,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
it
specifically
says
who
has
the
power
to
require--
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
--i
don't
believe
so.
the
courts
have
construed
it
in
different
ways.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
i
say
the
lower
courts
that
are
dealing
with
this
problem
on
a
daily
basis.
there
is--
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
--there
is
normally
a
choice.
i
have
had
clients...
i
don't
want
to
try
to
mystify
you
on
this,
but
i
have
had
clients
that
have
wanted
to
serve
the
two
days
in
jail
as
opposed
to
wearing
the
uniform,
and
the
courts
have
allowed
them
to
do
that.
it's
not
a
hard
and
fast
rule,
but
they
must
do
one
or
the
other.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor,
if
we
can
do
that,
please.
i
just
can't
lay
my
hand
on
it
right
away.
in
any
event,
with
the
mandatory
fine,
the
mandatory
incarceration,
or
dress
for
48
hours
in
this
distinctive
garb,
there
is
as
well
a
mandatory
education
course
on
alcohol
abuse.
there's
also
a,
a
mandatory
license
revocation
for
90
days,
the
second
45
days
of
which
a
driver
may
request
a
hardship
or
restricted
license.
of
course,
additionally
this
particular
crime
is
hedged
around
with
the
additional
conditions
of
being
non-negotiable
by
the
prosecutor
and,
of
course,
the
court
has
no
jurisdiction
to
reduce
the
jail
time
of
the
incarceration.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
no,
sir.
we,
we
recognize--
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
--we
recognize
that
rule
and
we
in
our
briefs
have
indicated
to
the
court
that
we
don't
think
you
need
to
abandon
that
rule
because
it
has
served
well
for
20
years
and
we
don't
want
to--
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
--because
what
the
state
of
nevada
is
doing
is
that
they're
pecking
underneath
the
line.
your
rules
have
said
and
the
state
of
nevada
has
said
it's
six
months.
you
puncture
that
particular
incarceration,
and
then
you
go
into
a
serious
crime.
the
state
of
nevada
is
staying
underneath
the
line,
but
it's
increasing
the
punishment
so
that
all
they
have
to
say
is,
well,
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
supreme
court,
all...
we
don't
have
more
than
six
months.
all
we
have
is
six
months.
what
we're
saying
is
that
they're
pecking
under
the
line
and
making
other
kinds
of
penalties
that
will...
ultimately,
especially
in
this
kind
of
case,
that
will
require
a
jury
trial.
we,
we
don't
ask
you
to
abandon
your--
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
--i'm
sorry,
sir.
i
did
not
understand
you.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
would
that
require
a
jury
trial?
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
that
probably
would
require
a
jury
trial.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
well,
he
can't.
in
the
state
of
nevada,
he
can't
go...
he
can't
go
home.
he
must
go
to
a
jail
for
two
days.
besides,
there
are
additional
penalties
here.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
yes,
sir,
but
he
has
to
do
community
service.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
yes,
sir.
you
can't
be
at
home
doing
this.
you
can't
be
dusting
your
furniture.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think
so.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
not
the
only
difference,
no,
sir.
there
are
other
penalties
here.
one
of
the
other
penalties
is
a--
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
--sir?
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
the
additional
penalties
are
loss
of
your
license
for
90
days,
45
days
of
which
are
non-suspendable
and
you
cannot
drive
for
45
days.
the
other
45
days,
at
the
tender
mercies
of
the
department
of
motor
vehicles
in
nevada,
you
can
have
a
restricted
license.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
there
is
no
provision
for
that
that
i'm
aware
of.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
the
penal
and
the
administrative
are
different.
no,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
it
will
be...
it'll
be
probably
suspended
even
before
you
go
to
trial
or
even
before
you
enter
a
plea
of
guilty.
they
are
very,
very
rapid--
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
--yes,
sir,
under
one
way
or
the
other.
yes,
sir,
it
would.
upon
his
second
conviction
of
driving
under
the
influence
in
the
state
of
nevada
within
seven
years,
it's
a
10-day
mandatory
jail
time
and
a
$500
mandatory
minimum
fine
and
a
one-year
loss
of
license.
and
there's
no
restricted
license
there.
the
third
conviction
within
seven
years
is
one
year
to...
to
six
years
in
the
nevada
state
prison.
it's
a
felony.
it
carries
a
mandatory
minimum
$2,000
fine
and
three
years'
loss
of
license.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
yes,
we
are.
but
what
we're
suggesting
is
that
the
second
and
third
convictions
are
conditions
and
provisions
that
this
court
can
take
into
consideration
to
gauge
the
seriousness
of
this
crime
in
the
minds
of
the
people
of
the
state
of
nevada
through
their
legislators.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
thank
you.
just
a
moment.
this
court
has
historically
used
two
types
of
tests
for
gauging
the
seriousness
of
a
crime.
one
of
those
is
nature
of
the
offense,
and
the
other
is
the
penalty
of
the
offense,
and
then
there
is
sort
of
a
subtest
which
is
the
actual
numbers
of
states
which--
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
--yes,
ma'am,
it
did.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
you
don't
have
to
get
away
from
the
bright
line
test
except
that
this
case
doesn't
have
a
bright
line
holding.
you
have
gotten
away
from
bright
line
tests
in
the
past
in
your
franks
case...
in
the
frank
case.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
it
does.
it
meets
baldwin,
and
if...
if
the
court
sends
a
message
to
the
states
that
you
can
have
other
penalties
besides
the
six
and
five,
which
is
what
we
used
to
call
it
when
i
was
in
municipal
court,
six
months
in
jail
and
a
$500
fine,
then
we're
going
to
have
all
sorts
of
things
that
are
going
to
be
happening
underneath
the
line
because
as
long
as
the
state
doesn't
puncture
the
line
and
move
into
the
serious
area,
then
we
can
have
all
sorts
of
penalties
underneath.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
i...
i
do
not
stand
on
the
fact
that
the...
the
$500
is
written
in
stone.
it
could
be
$1,000
or
it
could
be
even
$2,000.
i
just...
again,
i
agree
with
the
court.
i
don't
think
it's
talismanic
and
we...
we
really
don't
hold
to
that.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
no
sir.
i
think
it
was
pretty
much
the
incarceration
factor.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
and
i
think
you
pretty
much
stood
on
that.
but
the
nature
of
the
offense.
the
bright
line
test
lived
in
baldwin
and
in...
and
in
the
duncan
cases.
but
you've
got
a
residuum
test
that
lives
beyond
that,
which
is
the
nature
of
the
offense
of
the
test,
and
the
lower
courts
have
found...
many
lower
courts
have
found...
there
are
some
that
have
not...
have
found
that
this
is,
in
fact,
a
serious
crime,
that
the
nature
of
the
offense
is
serious.
in
baldwin,
for
example,
in
footnote
6,
any
incarceration
in
excess
of
six
months
carried
the
right
to
jury
trial.
and
in
that
footnote,
per
justice
whiter
there
was
no
overruling
of
clawans
or
colts.
and
in
duncan,
which
preceded
it
by
two
years,
sentences
up
to
six
months
if
the
offense
otherwise
qualifies
as
a
petty
offense.
and
even
as
late
as
1976,
in
ludwig
v.
massachusetts,
it's
a
petty
offense
usually
defined
by
reference
to
the
maximum
punishment.
and
as
far
as
the
nature
of
the
offense,
of
course,
although
it's
sui
generis,
this
court
still
uses
the
nature
of
the
offense
in
contempt
cases.
so
it's
certainly
a
test
that
is
viable
and
is
usable.
and
we
have
cited
cases
that
the
lower
courts
have
found
driving
under
the
influence
to
be
a
malum
in
se
crime.
it
was
not
apparently
indictable
at
common
law,
although
there
was
one
case,
united
states
v.
hart--
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
--i
would
not
be
satisfied
with
that,
sir.
i
wouldn't
want
this
to
get
out
of
hand.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
well,
sir,
i
don't...
i
can't
make
a
general
statement.
i
just
know
that
under
the...
the
statute
that
we
have
here,
sir,
that
we
feel
that
this
particular
crime
is
serious
not
only
because
of
the
nature
of
the
offense,
but
also
because
of
the
penalty
and
because
30...
or
43
or
44--
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
--sir?
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
in--
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
--no,
sir,
i'm
not--
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
--i'm
not
suggesting,
sir,
that
the
penalty
ought
to
be
more
and
then
grant
us
the
right
to
a
jury
trial.
i'm
suggesting
that
the
crime
per
se
carries
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
because
it
is
malum
in
se
and
has
been
so
held
by
the
lower
courts.
what
i'm
suggesting
to
the
court
is
that
20
to
22
states,
in
fact,
do
punish
first
offense
driving
under
the
influence
by
one
year:
new
york,
alabama.
there
are
places
that
punish
driving
under
the
influence
first
offense
by
one
year,
and
they
give
you
a
right
to
a
jury
trial.
and
if
the
court
reviews
its
cases
in
this
regard...
and
you
take
callan,
for
example,
1888.
is...
it
is
an
offense
of
a
grave
nature
affecting
the
public
at
large.
that's
dui.
schick,
1904
it
is
a
crime
true
of
moral
delinquency.
colts,
1930,
it
is
a
grave
offense.
that
is
dui.
and
then
when
you
take
a
look
at
the
mala
prohibita
crimes,
the
colts
in
1930...
for
the
court
to
characterize
reckless
driving,
or
in
this
case
dui,
as
a
petty
crime,
would
be
to
shock
the
general
moral
sense.
and
this...
this
court
may
write
a
decision
that
says
that
driving
under
the--
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
--well,
yes,
sir.
but
i'm
not
sure
that
you
can
make
the
distinction
between
an
alcohol
level
and
whether
somebody
else
is
going
to
react
differently
to
alcohol
than
anybody
else.
in
the
state
of
nevada--
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
--well,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
that
is
the,
the
considered
judgment
of
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
nevada
that
there
are
two
ways
to
convict
in
the
state
of
nevada
for
driving
under
the
influence.
one
is.10
or
greater,
and
that's
per
se.
it's
presumptive
that
you're
driving
under
the
influence.
the
second
one
are
the
factual,
that
if
you
refuse
a
test,
for
example,
then
if
you're
weaving
down
the
road
and
if
your...
your
breath
is
wreaking
of
alcohol
and
there
are
other
physical
attributes,
then...
i
think
that
in
any
event,
that
it's
malum
in
se.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
the
same
penalties.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
well,
as
a
practical
matter,
they
are
tried
together.
the.10
and
also
the
physical
characteristics,
of
course,
are
all
tried
together.
but
in
any
event,
the.10
and
the
driving
under
the
influence
both
carry
the
same
penalties.
so,
no
matter
how
you
prove
the
case,
you're
still
subjected
to
the
same
sentence
and
the
same
conviction
of
driving
under
the
influence,
and
i
don't
think
that
the.10
or
whether
it
was
a.15
would
make
that
much
difference
in,
in
the
analogy.
perhaps
i...
i'm
missing
the
question,
but
i
don't--
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
--i'm
not...
just
for
the
fact
of
driving
three
hours
before...
or
drinking
three
hours
before
you--
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
--so,
any
amount
of
alcohol
in
the
blood
then
is
going
to
be
a
malum
in
se?
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
that
would
be
malum
in
se.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
are
we
talking
about
driving
and
drinking
at
this
time,
the
three
hours
before?
all
i
can
tell
you,
your
honor,
is
that
the...
the
state
of
nevada
has
picked.10.
thirty-nine
states
have
picked
that
level
as
presumptively
under
the
influence,
and
that's
the
standard
that
we
have
to
work
with.
and
i'm
sorry
that
i
can't
answer
your
question
any
more
specifically,
but
if
we're
moving
back
from
the
area
of
driving
under
the
influence
to
drinking
three
hours
before
you
get
onto
the
road
and
that
is
going
to
be
a
crime,
just
drinking
three
hours,
that
is
a
petty
crime.
that's
malum
prohibitum.
but
once
you
get
behind
the
wheel,
then
you
trigger
this
offense.
there
is
no
driving
impaired
in
the
state
of
nevada.
it's
just
driving
under
the
influence.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
that...
that
probably
would
be
a
malum
prohibitum
crime
because
it
is
just
too
low.
after
three
hours
it
would
be
in
any
event.
the
penalty
provision...
the...
of
this
crime
is
not
just
the
fine
and
incarceration
as
in
baldwin.
as
the
court
has
seen,
the
state
of
nevada
has
moved
away
from
just
the
fine
and
imprisonment
and
has
moved
on
to
other
areas.
basically,
what
the
state
wants
is
to
have
their
cake
and
eat
it
too.
one
of
the,
the
penalties
that
i
think
is
the
most
important
of
this
particular
crime
is
losing
your
license
because
you're
losing
the
right
to
use
the
public
highways.
and
the
state
of
nevada...
and
we're
only
talking
about
the
state
of
nevada.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
it
is
a
separate
administrative
proceeding.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
yes,
sir,
it
is
because
as
soon
as
you
are
convicted
of
driving
under
the
influence,
then
the
court
sends
notice
to
the
department
of
motor
vehicles
and
they
will
automatically
revoke
your
license.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
yes,
sir,
it
can.
there
are
two
provisions
in
the
state
of
nevada.
one
of
the
provisions
administratively
is
that
as
soon
as
you
are
arrested,
if
you
have.10
or
greater
blood
in
your...
of,
of
alcohol
in
your
blood,
then
your
license
is
revoked
because
of
that.
then
later
on--
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
--no,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
no.
no,
sir.
and
then
we
move
on
to
when
there
is
a
conviction.
and
then
when
you
are
convicted,
they
revoke
your
license
on
the
basis
of
the
conviction.
now,
they
do
give
you
credit
for
the
time
that
you
served
over
here.
so,
if
your
blood
was.10
or
greater
and
you
got
a
90-day
suspension,
you're
convicted,
and
then
over
here
you
have
a
revocation
because
of
the
conviction.
you
are
given
the
credit
for
the
90
days
you
have
here
over
here.
but
there's
still
a
penalty
involved
because
you've
got...
the
actual
revocation
is
on
your
record
at
the
department
of
motor
vehicles.
so,
they've
got
two
chances
to
revoke
your,
your
license,
but
we
don't
particularly
speak
about
the
first
one
since
that
really
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
criminal
case
unless
you're
actually
convicted.
in
summation,
i
would...
i
would
advise
the
court
that
we
think
that
you
should
apply
all
three
tests
and
not
to
abandon
the
baldwin
standard.
now,
it
may
be
presumptively
petty
if
the
baldwin
standard
is
not
breached,
but
we
feel
that
in
this
particular
case
that
all
three
should
be
utilized
by
the
court
for
this
particular
offense.
my
own
opinion
is
that
driving
under
the
influence
is
really
sui
generis.
there
is
no
other
crime
of
which
i
am
aware
that
is
really
vying
for
serious
status...
none.
and
i've
been
in
this
area
for
probably
six
or
seven
years,
and
although,
of
course,
defense
attorneys
always
try
to
get
jury
trials
as
a...
as,
as
a
practical
matter,
they
don't
get
them.
this
case...
the
lower
courts...
this
type
of
offense...
the
lower
courts
are
riddled...
riddled...
with
instances
where
the,
the
courts
have
given
jury
trials
in
these
types
of
cases.
and,
of
course,
this
court
has
said
that
there
is,
indeed,
a
commitment
to
jury
trials.
i
mean,
when
you
consider
the
types
of
offenses
that
this
court
has
denied
jury
trials
in...
the
clawans
case;
selling
the
unused
portions
of
railway
excursion
tickets;
and
the
schick
case,
failure
to
stamp
the
oleomargarine;
natal,
a
private
market
six
squares
from
a
public
market...
those
are
trifling
offenses.
this
is
not
a
trifling
offense.
the
cost
of
this--
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
--no,
sir.
i'm
talking
about...
no,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
all
right.
the
state
of
nevada...
there
is
no
right
to
trial
by
jury
in
a
driving
under
the
influence
case.
now,
in
the
lower
courts,
state
and
federal,
many
courts
have
allowed
the
right
to
jury
trial
in
dui
cases.
that's
what
i'm
saying.
if
this
court
were
to
rule
for
us,
for
the
petitioners,
and
allow
a
jury
trial
in
the
state
of
nevada,
this
is
probably
what's
going
to
happen.
the
state
legislature
is
going
to
move
this
offense
into
the
district
court.
just
like
ludwig
v.
massachusetts,
you're
going
to
move
it
right...
it's
going
to
be
moved
right
up
there.
there's
a
great
waiver
factor.
i
mean,
we've
shown
that
in
our
opening
brief
that
there's
a
great
waiver
factor,
not
only
in
misdemeanor
cases
generally,
but
in
dui
cases
in
particular.
and
it
is
also
true
in
the
baldwin
case.
i
mean,
even
in
the
state
of
nevada,
they're
giving
dui
jury
trials
in
washoe
county,
but
we
don't
have
them
in
clark
and
the
rest
of
the
surrounding
areas.
so,
even
in
the
state
of
nevada
itself,
we're
granting
jury
trials.
and
lastly,
i
think
that
since
the
court
has
ruled
on
punishment
other
than
incarceration--
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
it's
my
understanding
from
the
acll's
amicus
curiae
brief
that...
that
in
fact
they
are...
i'd
have
to
defer,
but
i
think
they're
still
granting
jury
trials.
they
just
feel
that
it's
coming,
and
they're
going
ahead
and
preparing
of
it...
for
it.
and
i
think
in
1987
they
only
had
12
at
a
cost
of
$4,000.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
well,
i'm
just...
i'm
just
indicating
to
the
court
that
i
feel
that...
that
may
be
true.
i
cannot
persuade
the
court
otherwise,
but
that's
just
what
i'm
led
to
believe.
but
in
any
event,
i
would
sincerely
urge
the
court
to
grant
us
jury
trials
in
driving
under
the
influence
cases
in
the
state
of
nevada.
and
i
would
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
if
i
could.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
i'll
be
brief.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
yes,
sir.
this
court
has
ruled
in
several
cases,
not
per
se
on
the
jury
trial
issue,
that
the
offense
of
driving
under
the
influence
is,
is
quite
serious.
justices
white
and
rehnquist,
now
chief
justice
rehnquist,
of
course,
in
that
decision,
welsh
v.
wisconsin,
and
in
other
cases
have
found--
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
--i'm
sorry,
sir.
have
found...
this
court
has,
has
painted
the
offense
of
driving
under
the
influence
in
very
somber
tones.
responding
quickly
to
the
clear-cut
guideline
test,
the
only
thing
that
i
can
tell
the
court
is
that
the
lower
courts
have
been
applying
all
three
tests
for
years.
even
in
the
landry
v.
hoepfner
case
in
the
fifth
circuit,
which
does
not
rule
in
our
direction,
applied
all
three
tests.
and
i
think
with
respect
to
them
that
it
was
afraid
not
to
because
you
can't
just
say,
well,
it
doesn't
apply
to
baldwin
or
it
doesn't
fit
the
baldwin
rule
and
therefore
we...
we're
going
to
deny
the
right
to
jury
trial.
the--
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
--no,
sir.
no,
sir,
not
at
all.
baldwin
has
worked
well.
counsel
spoke
about
the
frank
case
and
having
to
overrule
frank.
i
would
think
that
losing
a
driver's
license
is
more
serious
than
living
the
life
of
a
normal
citizen
in
the
community.
if
you
lose
your
license
for
45
days,
you
may
lose
your
job.
and
if
you
don't
get
a
restricted
license,
you're
going
to
lose
it
for
90
days.
and
i
think
that's...
that's
pretty
serious.
mr.
john
j.
graves,
jr.
no,
sir,
that's
true.
but
in,
in
this...
in
this
particular
case...
and
i'm
out
of
time.
in
this
particular
case,
it
is
a
direct
result
of
the
penalty.
