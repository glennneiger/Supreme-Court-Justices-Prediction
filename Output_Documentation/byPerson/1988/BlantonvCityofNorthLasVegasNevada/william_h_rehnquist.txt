we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
87-1437,
melvin
blanton
v.
the
city
of
north
las
vegas.
mr.
graves,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
nevada
supreme
court
made
no
point
about
fraley
having
pleaded
guilty.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
go
ahead.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's...
that's
the
choice
of
the
defendant,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
the
courts,
you
mean
the
various
courts
in
nevada--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
baldwin
didn't
say
anything
about
a
fine,
did
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
your
license
revoked
in
the
criminal
proceeding,
or
is
it
a
separate
administrative
proceeding?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
really
isn't
a
criminal
penalty
then
in
many
senses
of
the
word.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i,
i
thought
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
your
license
could
have
been
revoked
before
trial.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
washoe
county
granting
jury
trials
after
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
nevada
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
graves.
mr.
zalaoras,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
perhaps
you
could
refer
justice
stevens
to
the
reasoning
of
the
court
in
the
argersinger
case
to
explain
why
the
word
"criminal
prosecution",
at
least
in
the
eyes
of
the
court,
could
be
read
differently
for
one
purpose
than
for
the
other.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
liberty
to
wear
what
kind
of
shirt
you
want?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why...
why
do
you
say
it
will
be
greater
than
that
imposed
for
the
federal
courts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
what,
what,
what
you're
saying
in
effect
is
that
if
we
rule
for
the
petitioner
here,
we
will,
in
effect,
overrule
the
frank
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
the
defendant...
were
either
of
these
defendants
sentenced
to
this
particular
form
of...
of
punishment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
has
the
supreme
court
of
nevada
ever
approved
the
sentencing
of
someone
to
do
their
two
days'
community
work
in
this
kind
of
an
outfit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
statute
says
nothing
about
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
zalaoras.
mr.
graves,
you
nave
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you'll
have
to
be.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
you
speak
up
a
little
bit,
mr.
graves?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yet,
you
can
use...
lose
your
driver's
license
by
just
driving
with
a...
an
expired
license.
i
mean,
it
wouldn't
have
to
be
a
criminal
proceeding
at
all.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
graves.
the
case
is
submitted.
