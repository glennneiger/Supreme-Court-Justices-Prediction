you,
of
course,
don't
recognize
the
rule
that
any
charge
that
is
less
than
six
months
does
not
need
a
jury
trial.
you,
you
just
don't
recognize
that
rule?
justice
thurgood
marshall
xxx?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
explain
to
me
again
why
this
is
different.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
would
six
months
and
two
days
of
house
arrest
be
bad?
justice
thurgood
marshall
two...
six
months
and
two
days
of
house
arrest.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's...
what's
the
difference
between
that
and
this
one,
because
he
can
stay
at
home
with
that.
he
doesn't
have
to
wear
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
didn't
you
say
he
could
wear
that
for
two
days?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
doesn't...
he
has
to
be
out
on
the
street.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
so,
that's
enough
for
a
jury
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
the
only
difference.
justice
thurgood
marshall
let
me
have
the
other
penalties.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i,
i
assume
you'd
be
satisfied
if
the
penalty
was
a
minimum
of
25
years
and
you
were
given
a
jury
trial.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
was
just
wondering
the
way
you
were
going
with
your
argument.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
it's
serious,
then
the
penalty
should
be
more.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
your
argument?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
we
can't
raise
the
penalty.
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
can't
take
judicial
notice
of
facts
in
an
amicus
brief,
can
we?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
are
you
telling
us
that
for?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
want
us
to
change
baldwin?
