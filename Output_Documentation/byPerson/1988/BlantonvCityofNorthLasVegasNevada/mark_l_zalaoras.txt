mr.
mark
l.
zalaoras
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
the
outset,
i
wish
to
point
out
that
the
issue
raised
earlier
with
regard
to
the
dui
punishment
provisions
in
nevada
is
set
out...
the
statute,
the
punishment
statute
in
full,
is
set
out
in
the
nevada
attorney
general
amicus
brief,
appendix
a,
pages
la
and
2a.
and
essentially
what
that
provides
is
it
is
the
court's
discretion
whether
to
allow
the
defendant,
the
convicted
defendant,
to
perform
48
hours
of
community
service
wearing
the
distinctive
garb
or
whether
to
serve
the
minimum
two-day
jail
sentence.
that
is
literally
what
the
statute
provides.
in,
in--
mr.
mark
l.
zalaoras
--i
think
it's
a--
mr.
mark
l.
zalaoras
--no.
it...
clearly
it
serves
a
couple
a
functions,
one
of
which
is--
mr.
mark
l.
zalaoras
--deterrence
to
the
others.
i
would
submit
it
would
be
to
the
person
wearing
it,
yes.
mr.
mark
l.
zalaoras
is
your
honor's
question
would
that
offense
still
a
serious
offense
in
the--
mr.
mark
l.
zalaoras
--constitutional
context?
mr.
mark
l.
zalaoras
not
under
the
rulings
from
this
court,
no,
it
would
not.
mr.
mark
l.
zalaoras
i
believe
that's
what
the
court
would
hold
under
the
present--
mr.
mark
l.
zalaoras
--not
particularly.
mr.
mark
l.
zalaoras
not
particularly,
but
i
seriously
doubt,
although
i
accept
your
hypothetical,
that
a
state
would
make
such
a
serious
offense...
if
i
may,
by
way
of
analogy
to
the
state
statutory
scheme
in
nevada,
we
have
a
misdemeanor
annoying
a
minor
offense,
and
that
characteristically
is
prosecuted
where
there
was
no
physical
harm
or
no
physical
touching
of
the
child
other
than
perhaps
exterior.
we
then
have
more
opprobrious
offenses
providing
a
higher
punishment
than
the
six-month
misdemeanor
line.
so,
by
way
of
example
to
the
nevada
statutes,
i
believe
what
your
honor
is
referring
to
is
child
molestations
where
there's
some
physical
violation
of--
mr.
mark
l.
zalaoras
--i,
i
don't
see
that
that
is
analogous
to
this
situation
when
you
make
it
with
reference
to
the
distinctive
garb.
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
it's
not.
mr.
mark
l.
zalaoras
well,
clearly
it's
shameful,
but
there
are
many
misdemeanors
for
which
a
penalty
such
as
provided
in
nevada
in
the
dui
law
are
also
shameful.
i
would
submit
that
domestic
battery,
for
example,
is
a
shame...
shameful
conduct.
so
is...
in
nevada
we
have
a
scheme
by
which
possession
of
drugs
can
be
given
misdemeanor
treatment.
that's
shameful.
petty
larceny,
a
crime
of
moral
turpitude,
is
shameful
so...
and
there's
more
moral
turpitude
in
the
mens
rea
involving
a
petty
larceny
offense
than
there
is
in
a
dui
offense.
the
respondent
submits
that
the
decision
below
was
compelled
by
the
holding
in
logic
of
this
court's
decisions
in
duncan,
frank
and
baldwin.
there
are
three
major
points
to
this
presentation.
first,
the
bright
line
test
of
baldwin
established
six
months'
incarceration
as
the
threshold
between
petty
and
serious
offenses.
this
rule
is
easily
identified
and
ready...
readily
applied.
it
lends
itself
to
uniform
application
throughout
the--
mr.
mark
l.
zalaoras
--that's
correct.
mr.
mark
l.
zalaoras
oh,
no,
your
honor.
it's
clearly
a
criminal
prosecution
under
nevada
law,
but
it
does
not
break
the
threshold
established
in
the
baldwin
case,
which
necessitates
under
the
command
of
the
constitution,
as
this
court
has
interpreted
it,
for
a
jury
trial.
mr.
mark
l.
zalaoras
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
that
your
honor
alludes
to
clearly
applies.
mr.
mark
l.
zalaoras
yes,
it
does.
mr.
mark
l.
zalaoras
no.
mr.
mark
l.
zalaoras
that's
true,
but
more
specifically
because
there's
jail
time
that
in
fact
has
to
be
imposed.
mr.
mark
l.
zalaoras
no.
the
level
of
the
criminal
offense,
as
defined
by
the
severity
of
the
maximum
authorized
penalty,
determines
the
jury
trial
question,
not
whether
it
is
or
is
not
a
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
mark
l.
zalaoras
that's
true.
mr.
mark
l.
zalaoras
the...
there
is
a
parallel...
and
this
is
a
point
i
wish
to
make
in
my
argument...
between
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
and
the
sixth
amendment
jury
trial
right.
that
parallel...
the
key
factor
is
incarceration.
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
two
as
they
are...
have
been
accepted
in
our
interpretation
of
those
provisions.
first,
the
right
to
counsel...
it
has
been
held
that
that
is
a
key
element
whether
the
offense
is
a
minor
one,
such
as
a
misdemeanor
in
nevada
would
be,
or
whether
it's
a
more
serious
offense
where
a
jury
trial
would
come
into
play,
that
the
accused
is
entitled
at
least
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
proceedings
and
have
the
assistance
of
counsel.
it's
more
important
in
the
incarceration
area...
excuse
me...
the...
where
jail
time
is
in
the
offing
than
it
is
when
you
get
to
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
jury
trial.
there
is
great
historical
precedent
that
even
predates
our
country
for
having
non-jury
adjudications
where
classified
as
petty
offenses.
this
is
the
teachings
of
this
court's
case
precedent.
the
second
point
to
which
i
refer
this
court
is
that
there
is
no
constitutional
mandate
to
provide
jury
trials
for
persons
accused
of
drunk
driving.
to
create
such
a
right
would
extend
the
present
limit
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
jury
trial,
as
applied
to
the
states
via
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
clause,
beyond
the
scope
of
that
imposed
upon
the
federal
courts.
mr.
mark
l.
zalaoras
no,
clearly
not.
and
that
i
submit
is
an
appropriate...
although
whether
one
personally
agrees
with
it
or
not,
i
think
it's
an
appropriate
sanction
that
a
state
may
impose.
mr.
mark
l.
zalaoras
no,
because
incarceration...
that
is,
the
deprivation
of
liberty...
is
the
essential
point
to
the
six...
sixth
amendment
jury
trial
right,
and
that
does
not
provide
deprivation
of
liberty,
for
the
same
reason
the
fine
amount
is
not
a
significant
factor
in
the
determination
of
the
jury
trial
right.
mr.
mark
l.
zalaoras
would
that
even
be
the
case,
the
court...
no
court
demands
a
million
dollar
payment
or
a
hundred
dollar
payment
on
the
spot
at
the
moment
of
conviction.
i
would
submit
that
a
million
dollars
excessive.
whether
it
calls
under
the
jury
trial
issue
or
not
is
another
question.
and
i
respectfully
submit
that's
not
before
the
court
at
this
time.
however,
to
answer
your
honor's
question,
even
that
exorbitant
fine
is
ameliorated
by
the
ability
of
the
defendant
to
pay
it
in
installments
or
to
work
it
off
in
community
service.
however,
in
nevada...
and
this
is
why
the
million
dollar
fine,
if
worked
off
in
terms
of
community
service,
would,
would
not
match
the
million
dollar
amount.
it's
because
the
community
service
is
limited
to
120
hours
in
a
misdemeanor.
mr.
mark
l.
zalaoras
that
is
the
primary
or
the
most
relevant
criterion--
mr.
mark
l.
zalaoras
--no,
because
it...
the
court
has
focused
on
deprivation
of
liberty.
the
restraint
on
liberty
is
the
key
that
triggers
the
sixth
amendment
jury
trial
right,
just
as
it
triggers
the
right
to
counsel
under
the
sixth
amendment.
that
is
the
key.
mr.
mark
l.
zalaoras
well,
i
would
submit
that
that
is...
it
pales
in
significance
to
incarceration
of
the
person
where
they're
forced
to
wear
the
jail
garb
and
their,
their
liberty
is,
is
confined
to
the
cell
in
which
they
reside
at
the
time
of
their
incarceration.
the
petitioners
collateral
consequences
approach...
and
this
is
my
third
major
point
i
wish
to
make...
in
reliance
on
the
nature
of
the
offense
test
are
untenable.
these
concepts
lack
definable
boundaries.
they
fail
to
provide
courts
with
a
clear-cut
guideline
to
follow,
and
this
is
because
of
their
vulnerability
to
subjective
interpretation.
the
bright
line
test
established
six
months
as
the
maximum
term
of
incarceration
beyond
which
the
jury
trial
right
is
triggered.
below
that,
the
court
has
held,
a
jury
trial
right
is,
is
not
invoked
by
the
constitutional
provisions.
in
duncan,
this
case
extended
that
jury
trial
right
to
the
states
through
the
incorporation
doctrine
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
however,
there
is
a
limitation
on
that
extension.
it
applies
to
the
states
only
to
the
extent
that
that
jury
trial
right
is
imposed
in
federal
courts.
should
this
court
rule
in
petitioners'
favor,
in
fact,
there
will
be
extended
a
greater
constitutional
right
broader
in
scope
than
that
that
is
imposed
upon
the
federal
courts.
this
is
in
direct
violation
to
the
duncan
ruling.
it
also--
mr.
mark
l.
zalaoras
--because
the
petitioners
have
relied
upon
not
the
six-month
incarceration
rule,
but
these
collateral
consequences
of
the
conviction.
in
the
federal
courts,
the...
well,
this
court
has
determined
that
in
a
federal
case,
frank
v.
the
united
states,
that
a
three-year
probationary
term,
which
has
more
onerous
restraints
or
the
defendant
than
does
the
statutory
scheme
of
dui
in
nevada,
resulted
in
the
court
finding
in
frank
that
it
was
not
a
serious
offense
in
the
constitutional
context
of
that
term.
mr.
mark
l.
zalaoras
that's
correct,
and,
and
the
duncan
ruling.
the
application
of
duncan,
that
duncan
made
of
the
sixth
amendment
to
the
states,
is
limited
to
the
extent
to
which
it
is
applied
in
federal
courts.
i
submit
that
that...
that
would
be
the
only
alternative.
you'd
have
to
overrule...
you'd
have
to
extend
it
beyond
that
provided
to
the
states.
now,
i
think
frank
illustrates
the
point.
frank
was
a
federal
criminal
contempt
matter.
and
the
court
in
sentencing...
rather,
suspended
sentence
on
ben
frank
and
instead
imposed
a
three-year
term
of
probation
with,
and
i
wish
to
note,
the
specific
probationary
conditions
imposed
on
mr.
frank.
first,
he
was
not
allowed
to
travel
outside
the
state
without
permission
of
the
probation
officer.
he
was
required
to
work
regularly,
secondly.
thirdly,
he
has
required
to
report
any
changes
in
his
work
schedule
with
his
probation
officer.
he
was
told
he
could
only
associate
with
law-abiding
persons.
and
he
was
to
maintain
reasonable
work
hours.
i
submit
that
those
conditions
placed
on
the
probationer
in
the
frank
case
are
much
more
forceful
restraint
on
liberty
than
are
the
collateral
consequences
to
which
the
petitioners
rely.
i
believe
this
puts
petitioners,
in,
in
essence,
in
a
checkmate
position
on
their
argument
out
of
which
they
cannot
come
without
overturning
that...
the
basic
ruling
of
duncan.
again,
the
critical
distinction
in
the
sixth
amendment
jury
trial
and
sixth
amendment
right-to-counsel
cases
is
the
deprivation
of
liberty,
the
punishment.
specifically,
with
regard
to
some
of
the
collateral
consequences
to
which
the
petitioners
allude,
i
think
a
short
analysis
is
appropriate
and
especially
in
comparison
with
the
probationary
provisions
in
the
frank
case.
the
mandatory
jail
provision
is
ameliorated
by
the
fact
that
the
defendant
could
perform
the
48
hours
of
community
service.
it's
further
ameliorated
by
the
fact
that
characteristically
courts
credit
the
individual
for
the
time
he
served
in
jail
at
his
arrest
and
do
not
require
an
additional
two
days,
if
in
fact
he
served
two
days
before
he
came
before
the
magistrate
for
his
initial
appearance.
secondly,
petitioners
have
referred
to
the
enhancement
aspect
of
the
dui
statute;
that
is,
that
for
second
and
third
offenses,
the
penalty
rises,
and
on
the
third
offense
it
would
become
a
felony.
that
is
not
an
unusual
statutory
scheme,
because
of
the
habitual
criminal
act
we
have
in
nevada
and
that
many
states
provide.
for
example,
after
the
third
petty
larceny,
it
becomes
a
felony
upon
prosecution
and
conviction
of
the
fourth
petty
larceny
if
the,
the
district
attorney
determines
to
file
it
as
a
felony.
and
that
calls
for
a
mandatory
minimum
of
ten
years
in
prison
with
a
maximum
of
20
years.
moreover,
in
the
petty
larceny
realm
still,
after
the
fifth
petty
larceny
conviction...
that
is,
upon
the
sixth
petty
larceny...
the
statute
provides
for
life
imprisonment
in
nevada.
cannot
the
same
argument
be
made,
unlike
what
i
think
counsel
for
petitioners
has
suggested,
that
someone
may
come
before
this
court,
if
they're
able
to
reach
this
level,
and
argue
in
a
petty
larceny
case
that,
well,
i'm
subject
to
enhanced
penalties,
and
if
i
commit
five
more
petty
larcenies,
i'll
go
to
prison
for
life,
therefore,
it's
serious
in
the
constitutional
context?
i
believe
this
is
analogous
to
their
argument
regarding
enhancement.
it
also
holds
true
for
the
domestic
battery
situation,
with
regard
to
enhancement
and
also
with
regard
to
the
claim
that
the
social
program
that
accompanies
the
conviction
for
dui
is
somehow
significant
enough
to
elevate
what
is
otherwise
a
petty
offense
into
the
serious
category.
for
example,
in
domestic
battery
in
nevada,
the
officer
must
make
an
arrest
if
there
was
a
battery
committed
between
persons
who
are
related
by
blood
or
marriage
and
there
is
some
other
evidence,
such
as
physical
evidence,
to
indicate
that
that
crime
has
occurred.
that
person
cannot
make
bail
for
12
hours.
it's
a
non-bailable
offense,
which
at
this
point
of,
course,
is
merely
an
accusatory
stage.
in
addition,
there
are
other
collateral
consequences.
once
a,
a
battery
conviction
results,
the
court
has
the
ability
to
require
the
person
to
attend
a
counseling
program,
and
if
the
victim
is
over...
is
65
years
of
age
or
older,
the
nevada
statutes
provide
for,
in
effect,
a
doubling
of
the
punishment,
in
which
case
it
would
arise
into
a
serious
offense
and
a
jury
trial
right
would
have
to
be
provided.
but
what
these
illustrate,
these
examples
i've
explained,
is
the
fallacy
in
taking
the
petitioners'
approach
of
viewing
the
nature
of
the
offense.
the
clear-cut
guideline
established
by
the
objective
approach
that
baldwin
indicates
by
looking
to
the
maximum
authorized
penalty
is,
to
paraphrase
the
frank
decision,
the
only
objective
criterion
by
which
a
line
could
ever
be
drawn
on
the
basis
of
the
possible
penalty
alone
is
how
we
separate
petty
from
serious
offenses.
mr.
mark
l.
zalaoras
there's
no
statutory
description
for
it.
what
is
in
the
statute
is
all
we
have
in
terms
of
guiding
the
court.
mr.
mark
l.
zalaoras
well,
as
i
say,
the
statute
doesn't
speak
to
it,
so
in
theory,
yes,
it
could.
i
would
hope
that
some
decorum
would
be
engaged
by
any
court
in
such
a...
such
an
endeavor,
however,
and--
mr.
mark
l.
zalaoras
--it
may
trouble
me
as
a
prosecutor
and
an
officer
of
the
court.
it
certainly
would.
but
it
does
not
call
into
question
the
jury
trial
right.
mr.
mark
l.
zalaoras
bianton
is...
is
still
not
in
a
convicted
status.
fraley
is,
and
i
don't
recall
offhand
if
his
two-day
jail
sentence
was
a
matter
where
he
was
given
credit
or
if
he
chose
community
service.
he
took
an
appeal,
so
in
fact
the...
the
conviction...
the
judgment
following
the
conviction
has
never
been
enforced.
mr.
mark
l.
zalaoras
no,
it
hasn't
addressed
the
issue.
mr.
mark
l.
zalaoras
that's
correct.
the
opportunity
i
suppose
existed
in
the
decisions
below,
but
it
was
not
addressed
as
the
type
of
garb
that
was
worn.
regarding
the
nature
of
the
offense
test
and
the...
the
reason
i
think
why
it's
too
subjective
is
best
illustrated
by
language
from
clawans
which
was
reiterated
in
the
frank
opinion,
wherein
it
stated
that
doubts
must
be
resolved
not
subjectively
by
recourse
of
the
judge
to
his
own
sympathy
and
emotions,
but
by
objective
standards
such
as
may
be
observed
in
the
laws
and
practices
of
the
community
taken
as
a
gauge
of
its
social
and
ethical
judgments.
one
other
point
i
wish
to
make
with
regard
to
the
national
standards
test
to
which
petitioners
refer,
and
that
is
what
i
call
the
head
count
of
states.
i
don't
believe
that
has
constitutional
significance.
although
it
appears
as
though
44
states
provide
jury
trials
for
persons
accused
with
a
first-offense
dui,
they
do
so
for
one
of
three
reasons.
first
off,
their
state
constitution
requires
it;
or
secondly,
their
state
statutory
scheme
requires
it;
and
thirdly,
the
other
reason
why
they
provide
jury
trials
is
because
the
maximum
authorized
penalty
exceeds
six
months.
it
exceeds
the
baldwin
bright
line
anyway.
so,
i
don't
believe
that
that
is...
it's
in
essence
a
red
herring
to
argue
that
44
states
provide
it
and
therefore
nevada
should
in
this
case.
morever,
in
martin
v.
ohio,
this
court
held
that
there
was
no
constitutional
dimension
to
the
fact
that
48
states
had
a
particular
approach
to
a
criminal
procedure,
in
that
case
the
self-defense
argument,
and
which
side
has
the
burden
of
proof.
in
that
instance,
ohio
and
south
carolina
were
recognized
as
the
only
two
states
that
placed
the
burden
of
proving
self-defense
on
the
defendant.
and
the
court
there
found
that
there
was
no
constitutional
dimension
to
the
fact
that
48
states
did
so.
without
further
questions,
i
thank
the
court.
