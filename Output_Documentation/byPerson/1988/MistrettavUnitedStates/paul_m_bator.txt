mr.
paul
m.
bator
mr.
chief
justice,
and
say
it
please
the
court,
the
problem
that
congress
faced
when
it
enacted
this
statute
is
well
known
to
this
court.
i'll
try
to
adjust
my
machinery
here...
there's
too
much
machinery.
the
problem
is
familiar
to
this
court
from
cases
like
furman
and
georgia
and
other
cases
which
showed
ugly
and
indefensible
discriminations
and
disparities
and
irrational
distinctions
in
the
punishments
that
people
get
in
the
criminal
justice
system.
and
in
those
cases,
litigants
came
to
this
court
and
said
"this
court
should
do
something
about
that."
now,
this
case
is
very
different
because
in
this
case,
the
executive
departments
and
the
congress
for
10
years
put
on
a
massive
bipartisan
effort,
and
it
said,
"we're
going
to
do
something
about
it."
"we're
going
to
reduce
these
ugly
and
indefensible
discriminations
and
disparities
in
criminal
sentences."
and
now
this
court
is
being
asked
to
undo
this
effort
and
really
send
us
back
to
what
were
very
ugly
days
of
discriminatory
and
arbitrary
sentencing.
now,
i
think
really
the
key
to
mr.
morrison's
submission
here
today
is
simply
that
this...
congress
has
never
quite
created
an
animal
quite
like
this.
the
sentencing
commission
is
not
quite
like
the
parole
board...
its
guidelines
are
not
quite
like
the
rules
of
procedure,
and
therefore
this
is
un-constitutional.
but
there
is
no
rule
of
constitutional
law
that
congress
may
not
do
something
that
is
new.
in
this
courtroom,
this
petitioner
must
really
show
that
this
act
violated
the
separation
of
powers
by
really
prejudicing
one
of
the
branches
from
doing
their
constitutionally-appropriate
law.
we
really
must
find
actual
prejudice
under
the
standards
of
separation
of
powers
that
this
court
has
promulgated.
mere
atmospherics
is
not
enough,
and
our
central
submission,
your
honors,
is
that
there
is
no
incursion
here
on
any
constitutional
role
of
the
executive,
and
that
this
commission
and
this
act
does
not
prejudice
the
independence
and
the
impartiality
and
the
performance
by
the
courts
of
doing
their
constitutionally-assigned
functions.
now,
this
act
is
an
act
that,
creates
an
institutional
design.
what
are
the
parts
of
the
design?
congress
says
this
ought
to
be
an
independent
commission,
and
as
far
as
i
understand,
there
was
no
serious
argument
that
that
was
un-constitutional.
congress
said
this
commission
should
not
be
controlled
by
the
political
branches
or
by
the
congress
or
even
controlled
by
the
courts,
because
this
agency
is
not
under
the
comination
of
the
courts.
second
congress
said
this
agency
is
to
be
designated
as
being
in
the
judicial
branch...
and
there's
been
talk
about
what
does
that
mean?
congress
had,
i
think,
very
simple
purposes
in
mind
in
making
that
designation.
it
had
practical
purposes.
the
commission
in
its
daily
work
works
intimately,
all
the
time,
with
the
judicial
apparatus,
and
it
just
makes
logistical
and
administrative
and
budgetary
sense
to
put
it
in
the
judicial
branch.
congress
had
a
symbolic
functions
here
in
this
designation.
as
the
senate
commission
said,
congress
wanted
sentencing
to
continue
to
be
primarily
a
judicial
function.
for
150
years,
it
was
the
judges'
responsibility
to
sentence.
and
that--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--but
the
general,
the
symbolism
of
making
the
judicial
branch
responsible
for
bringing
order
and
good
repair
into
the
judicial
house
of
sentencing...
congress
thought
that
it
was
important
to
make
the
judicial
branch
responsible
for
that
role.
congress
also
had
in
mind
your
honor...
it's
a
precautionary
note,
and
that's
the
point
of
independence.
congress
wanted
to
make
sure
that
sentencing
kept
free
from
the
domination
of
the
executive
branch,
which
initiates
prosecutions.
it
wanted
to
make
sure
the
commissions
is
independent.
now,
mr.
morrison's
central
submission...
i
think
justice
scalla's
questions
probe
at
this
issue...
is
that
the
problem
this
statute
creates
is
with
respect
to
the
judicial
branch,
because
the
judicial
has
never
before
been
given
the
task
of
issuing
legislative
style
rules
that
so
directly
affect
the
liberties
of
citizens.
they
have
been
given
this
task
that
looks
like
the
making
of
law...
and
mr.
morrison
says
that's
incongruous,
and
therefore
un-constitutional.
but
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
there
are
clearly
important
factors
which
show
that
this
is
a
separate
situation,
and
a
distinct
situation,
which
makes
this
a
congruous
assignment
by
congress.
congress
had,
really,
four
factors,
i
think,
in
mind.
first
of
all,
this
job
was
not
given,
justice
kennedy,
to
the
courts
or
to
the
judges.
it
was
given
to
an
agency
that
functionally
functions
exactly
like
a
hundred
other
independent
agencies.
it
happens
to
have
three
judges.
but
this
is
not
the
same
case
as
if
congress
had
said,
"this
court
is
to
issue
sentencing
guidelines."
the
court
does
not
need
to
decide
today
whether
that
would
be
constitutional,
although
in
candor
i
should
tell
the
court
that
our
position
is
that
sentencing
is
so
special
that
sentencing
is
so
closely
tied
to
the
fair
administration
of
justice
in
the
courts,
that
if
congress
finds
that
this
court
should
be
made
responsible
for
helping
to
bring
some
order
into
the
task
of
sentencing,
that
would
be
valid.
but
that's
not
this
court's
problem
today.
the
second
point
about
these
rules
is
historical.
this
delegation
is
novel
in
form
but
not
in
substance.
it
is
for
150
years
the
courts
have
already,
in
their
sentencing
decisions,
exercised
virtually
unfettered
lawmaking
power.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
i
think
i
agree
with
that
completely,
your
honor.
in
a
sense,
we
had
the
worst
of
both
worlds,
because
congress
had
created
no
general
standards,
so
the
courts
in
their
individual
decisions
were
making
general,
implicit,
general
standards.
the
only
difference
is
that
they
were
doing
it
one
by
one.
that
is,
there
is
a
sense
in
which
the
courts,
the
individual
judges,
were
making
sentencing
guidelines
for
150
years,
because
congress
provided
no
standards.
and
the
only
difference
is
that
they
did
it
each
one
for
himself,
each
one
for
herself.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
the
judge
has
unfettered
lawmaking
discretion.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
your
honor,
i
believe
substantively
they
were
making
the
law
in
deciding
what
ought
to
be
the
severity
of
punishment.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
they
were
doing
it
case
by
case...
of
course
i
acknowledge
that.
but
the
distinction
between
case
by
case
adjudication
and
general
rulemaking
is
at
its
weakest
where
the
congress
provides
no
general
standards,
and
the
courts
have
to...
even
it
implicitly...
create
the
standards
as
well
as
to
make
the
particular
application
point.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
your
honor,
our
position
would
be
that
if
congress
created
an
independent
agency
and
said
judges
ought
to
be
participating
in
it,
and
the
purpose
of
the
agency
is
to
rationalize
and
clean
up
a
system
of
incredible
discrepancies
in,
for
instance,
the
allocation
of
punitive
damages...
we
think
that
ought
to
be
constitutional.
now,
sentencing
seems
to
me
an
even
easier
case
though,
because
of
the
very
special
role
that
judges
nave
historically
played
in
the
creation
of
law
and
policy
with
respect
to
sentences.
but
that
is
within
the
general
ambit
of
our
argument,
your
honor,
and
would
a
distinguish
both
of
those
cases
from
what
we
were
talking
about...
the
anti-trust
guidelines.
there
is
a
jurisprudential
difference
between
sentencing
guidelines
and
anti-trust
guidelines.
sentencing
guidelines
do
not
tell
the
citizens,
"this
is
now
illegal".
no
sentencing
guideline
makes
illegal
or
actionable
anything
that
had
been
done
before.
of
course
it
has
an
impact
on
liberties,
but
it
is
not
jurisprudentially
a
substantive
rule,
and
that's
an
important
distinction.
i
have
one
more
point,
your
honors,
and
that's
a
separation
of
powers
point.
and
it's
also
a
very
important
practical
point.
overall,
globally
viewed,
the
sentencing
reform
act
significantly
reduces,
rather
than
expands,
the
overall
power
of
the
judicial
branch
to
make
law
with
respect
to
sentencing.
before
the
act,
the
judicial
branch
exercised
a
plenary
discretion
to
make
sentencing
law.
this
act
significantly
narrows
and
makes
accountable
that
power.
the
doctrine
of
separation
of
powers
is
supposed
to
have
something
to
do
with
liberty,
and
it
would
be
a
huge
irony
if
this
court
invalidated
a
statute
whose
global
effect
is
not
to
increase
but
sharply
to
curtail
the
prerogatives
of
one
of
the
branches
of
government.
your
honor,
i
have
not
had
time
to
deal
with
a
question
of
the
specific
service
at
judges,
and
i
will
leave
that
issue
to
the
briefs,
and
also
to
the
arguments
made
by
the
solicitor-general.
i
want
to
add
one
footnote,
if
i
have
time.
in
his
reply
brief,
mr.
morrison
makes,
i
think,
an
important
concession.
he
says
it
would
be
constitutional
to
have
a
commission
in
the
judicial
branch
with
judges
dealing
with
issues
of
parole
and
reduction
of
good
time.
i
think
that's
a
fatal
concession
for
him,
both
at
a
superficial
and
at
a
deep
level;
at
a
superficial
level,
because
i
don't
understand
the
distinction,
at
a
constitutional
level,
between
the
commission
that
deals
with
parole
and
the
commission
that
deals
with
the
things
this
commission
did.
at
a
deeper
level,
i
think,
the
concession
shows
that
sentencing
cannot
be
cabined
into
the
tidy
table
of
organization
that
petitioner
prefers.
sentencing
has
always
been
a
special
feature
of
our
jurisprudence.
it's
always
been
a
field
in
which
responsibility
has
been
shared
among
the
branches.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
has
always
been
the
prerogative
of--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--the
congress,
of
course,
has
plenary
constitutional
authority
to
determine
what
the
punishment
should
be.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so.
before
this
statute,
congress
in
the
substantive
criminal
statute
legislated
the
maximum,
and
the
individual
judge
had
plenary
discretion
on
where
to
sentence
within
that
maximum.
exactly
that
same
constraint
operated
on
the
commission.
the
maximums
created
by
statute
continue
to
bind
the
commission,
and
the
commission
and
the
judge
then
operating
with
the
guidelines
together
are
exercising
not
more
authority
but
less
authority
than
before
the
sentencing
guidelines,
because
congress
added
an
awful
lot
of
other,
specific,
narrowing
to
the
situation.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
honor's
question.
but
the
commission
operated
as
individual
judges.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
that's
true,
yes,
sir.
that's
exactly
what
the
district
judge
did
before.
the
district
judge
could
say,
for
this
offenses,
i
will
never
sentence
anybody
for
more
than
20
years.
