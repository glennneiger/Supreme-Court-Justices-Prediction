justice
harry
a.
blackmun
these
cases
concern
the
constitutionality
of
the
sentencing
reformat
of
1984,
and
that
act
created
the
united
states
sentencing
commission
as
an
independent
body
in
the
judicial
branch
with
power
to
promulgate
binding
sentencing
guidelines.
guidelines
have
been
issued
and
they
are
challenged
here.
similar
challenges
in
federal
courts
throughout
the
country
have
resulted
in
diverse
and
opposing
rulings.
and
because
of
that
conflict
in
the
great
importance
of
the
issues
in
the
administration
of
this
countryâ€™s
criminal
law,
we
granted
the
respective
petitions
of
defendant,
mistretta,
and
of
the
united
states
for
certiorari
before
judgment
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
a
too
long
opinion
i
have
here,
we
hold
that
the
sentencing
guidelines
are
constitutional
and
specifically,
that
congress
did
not
delegate
excessive
legislative
power
to
the
commission
and
did
not
violate
the
separation
of
powers
principled
by
placing
the
commission
in
the
judicial
branch
or
by
requiring
federal
judges
to
serve
on
the
commission
and
to
share
their
authority
with
non-judges
or
by
empowering
the
president
to
appoint
commission
members
and
to
remove
them
for
cause.
therefore,
in
this
litigation,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
missouri.
justice
brennan
joins
all
of
the
opinion
except
footnote
11;
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
