mr.
charles
fried
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
for
more
than
30
years,
congress
has
been
troubled
and
has
worked
at
the
problem
of
grave,
invidious,
and
inexplicable
disparities
in
the
federal
sentencing
process.
in
1958,
it
tried
some
gentle
measures.
it
put
in
the
judicial
councils
and
institutes
to
which
i
believe
justice
o'connor
made
reference.
that
did
no
good
at
all.
in
1976,
they
did
something
a
little
bit
more
drastic:
we
had
the
parole
commission
act,
which
sought
to
give
the
parole
commission
power
to
even
out
the
sometimes
quite
dreadful
disparities
after
the
fact,
and
the
court
will
be
familiar
with
that
from
the
adinizio
case.
that,
too,
failed,
and
it
failed
because
the
judges
and
the
parole
commission
were
working
at
cross
purposes,
and
the
sentencing
judges
would
anticipate
the
work
of
the
parole
commission
in
pronouncing
sentence.
so,
strong
measures
were
required
to
obtain
equality
and
honesty
in
sentencing.
now,
i
think
that
this
statute
is
misunderstood
when
it
is
viewed
as
being
unduly
rigid.
it
provides
for
25
percent
range
in
which
the
sentencing
judge
may
operate.
that
should
be
enough...
and
allows
for
departures
in
a
rather
wide
range
of
circumstances,
provided
that
the
judge
gives
reasons
and
explains
what
he's
doing.
now,
petitioner
raises
three
objections.
he
objects
that
congress
did
not
do
the
whole
job
here,
but
rather
delegated
it
to
an
expert
independent
agency,
and
then
petitioner
complains
as
to
how
that
agency
is
constituted,
and
most
particularly
about
the
inclusion
of
three
federal
judges
among
the
seven
members.
turning
to
the
delegation
point...
because
it's
a
good
way
to
indicate
what
the
commission
actually
did
do...
one
would
have
thought,
given
the
very
great
particularity
in
the
statute,
that
it
would
be
too
late
in
the
day
to
raise
a
delegation
objection.
in
fact,
the
statute
sets
not
only
the
goals
for
the
commission,
but
provides
the
methodology
and
makes
many
of
the
particular
judgments,
and
as
was
remarked
from
the
bench,
of
course,
all
of
this
takes
place
within
the
maxima
which
are
set
out
by
the
particular
criminal
statues,
and
which
are
the
basis
for
the
kind
of
grading
of
severity
to
which
mr.
morrison
referred.
turning
to
the
methodology
because
it's
most
important;
the
statue
required
the
commission
to
begin
with
actual
experience.
and,
indeed,
the
commission
surveyed
40,000
cases,
10,000
of
them
in
very
great
detail,
to
see
what
the
sentences
actually
served
under
actual
circumstances
involving
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
the
circumstances
of
the
offender...
what
they
were.
and
not
only
did
the
commission
start
with
actual
experience,
to
a
large
extent
that's
where
it
ended.
to
a
large
extent,
these
guidelines
reflect
today's
practice.
where
the
commission
departed
in
these
value
judgments
about
which
you've
heard,
they
have
done
so
under
the
explicit
mandate
of
the
act,
that
for
instance,
violent
offenders,
repeat
offenders,
career
criminals,
drug
traffickers,
be
sentenced
at
or
near
the
maximum.
that
is
not
something
the
commission
dreamed
up...
they
were
enjoined
to
do
that
by
the
statute.
similarly,
as
to
white
collar
criminals--
mr.
charles
fried
--what
i
was
suggesting,
justice
white,
is
that
the
commission
was
enjoined
to
do
it
by
the
statute,
and
therefore
they
were
not
simply
following
their
own
policy
judgement.
that
they
were
being
guided
by
what
congress
had
required,
and
the
guidance
from
congress
here,
i
submit,
was
miles
greater
than
we
usually
encounter
in
a
delegation.
mr.
charles
fried
i
am,
your
honor.
and
the
suggestion
that
this
is
something
that
congress
might
have
handed
to
an
advisory
panel,
then
to
enact
its
work,
misses
the
point
that
these
guidelines,
in
order
to
be
sensible
and
effective,
must
be
evolutionary.
they
must
require
monitoring
of
what
happens
and
constant
revision,
and
that
of
course
is
precisely
the
kind
of
work
which
is
given
to
an
independent
agency.
mr.
charles
fried
no,
i
do
not,
but
i
do
know
of
a
number
of
agencies
which
among
their
other
functions
do
promulgate--
mr.
charles
fried
--well,
i
ran
through
that
in
my
own
mind,
and
i
was
not
able
to
discover
one.
mr.
charles
fried
but
i
do
think
there
are
agencies
which
establish
laws
for
others
as
well
as
for
themselves,
and
laws
which
are
enforced
by
others
other
than
themselves.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
i
think
the
sec,
when
it
sets
down
rules,
is
making
rules
for
others,
and
for
the
enforcement
by
others,
as
much
as
for
themselves.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
in
this
case,
of
course,
the
regulations,
the
rules,
have
to
lie
before
congress
for
six
months
before
becoming
effective.
i
cannot
propose
any
general
objection
to
what
you
suggest.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
i
don't
think
that
we
have
here
a
way
of
getting
around
a
legislative
impasse
which
might
be
what
was
a
problem
in
the
gramm-rudman
situation...
because
here
congress
had
come
down
to
a
lot
of
very
specific
policy
judgments,
but
there
has
the
need
to
bring
them
that
last
six
feet
down
to
earth.
but
they'd
done
an
awful
lot
of
the
work
themselves.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
i
can't
answer
why--
mr.
charles
fried
--well,
i
would
answer
that
question
ultimately
by
saying
that
i
do
not
know
what
provision
of
the
constitution
is
violated
when
an
independent
agency
does
make
general
but
really
quite
guiding
legislative
judgments
ultimately
specific.
i
don't
think
it
violates
any
provision
of
the
law.
mr.
charles
fried
with
respect,
your
honor,
i
do
not
know
that
provision
of
the
constitution
is
violated
by
that.
mr.
charles
fried
i
would
call
that
executive,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
fried
if
they
are
executing
a
law
which
directs
them
to
make
more
specific
the
mandates
in
the
statute,
which
is
how
we
analyze
this
case.
now,
beyond
the
delegation,
beyond
the
delegation
objection,
which
obviously
is
more
formidable
than
i
had
imagined
it
to
be--
[laughter]
the
complaint
is
made
that
the
phrase,
that
this
is
an
independent
commission
in
the
judicial
branch
is
a
cause
for
concern.
should
we
stumble
over
the
phrase
"in
the
judicial
branch"?
a
number
of
things
are
quite
clear:
that
the
commission
is
not
a
court,
and
that
is
not
simply
a
technical
point.
it
is
not
a
court
because
it
does
not
issue
judgments
in
cases,
it
is
not
subject
to
appellate
jurisdiction,
its
judgments
cannot
be
appealed
from,
it
is
not
issuing
final
judgments.
and
it
is
not
subordinate
to
any
court
as
are,
for
instance
probation
officers
or
bankruptcy
judges.
it
is
in
the
judicial
branch
in
a
perfectly
harmless,
constitutionally
harmless
sense,
and
that
is,
first
of
all,
that
it
is...
its
judicial
branch
connections,
which
explain
the
logistics
of
managing
this
commission...
who
makes
out
the
checks,
how
is
the
budget
submitted,
that
particular
housekeeping
rules,
such
as
the
freedom
of
information
act,
conflict
of
interest
laws,
and
xx
on,
will
apply?
similarly,
there
is
a
strong
administrative
connection
between
the
commission
and
the
administrative
office
of
the
courts,
and
the
probation
offices,
which
supply
it
with
a
great
deal
of
its
information.
and
that
seems
to
me
a
set
at
consequences
which
congress
might
have
provided
in
detail,
but
in
fact,
it
did
so
compendiously
by
stating
that
this
is
an
independent
commission
in
the
judicial
branch.
furthermore,
of
courses,
and
much
more
substantively,
this
is
a
way
of
underlining
congress'
very
great
concern
that
this
be
an
independent
commission...
and
that,
of
course,
is
also
thereby
accomplished.
but
beyond
that,
i
see
no
reason,
i
see
no
need,
to
engage
in
a
rewriting
or
severance,
or
anything
else,
of
what
congress
did,
because
i
am
unable
to
discover
any
harmful,
any
infectious
aspect
to
that
designation.
what
the
designation
does
do
is
perfectly
appropriate,
and
if
there
is
some
work
that
it
does
do
that
i
have
not
been
able
to
discover,
that
is
inappropriate,
by
all
means
let
us
sever
that,
but
i
don't
know
what
it
is.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
congress
was
very
concerned
to
insist
on
the
independence
of
the
agency,
and
very
concerned--
mr.
charles
fried
--well,
it
could
have
done
it
one
time,
justice
marshall,
but
the
need
here
is--
mr.
charles
fried
--indeed
it
could.
mr.
charles
fried
but
the
important
thing
is
that
this
be
allowed
to
evolve,
that
there
be
monitoring
of
the
experience,
collection
of
the
data...
that's
a
monumental
task,
and
continuous
revision...
and
that
is
something--
mr.
charles
fried
--you
wouldn't
have
had
this
headache,
but
you
also
would
not
have
had
the
promise
of
continuous
monitoring
and
revision,
which
is
what
is
necessary
to
make
something
which
would
really
work.
so
i
think
that
if
it
could
have
been
a
one-shot
affair,
that
would
have
been
a
different
story,
but
i
don't
think
it
sensibly
could
have
been
a
one-shot,
one-time
affair.
i'd
like
to
turn--
mr.
charles
fried
--i
agree,
it
does
not
make
any
difference
at
all,
justice
kennedy,
and
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
objection
to
the
service
of
three
judges
on
the
committee.
mr.
charles
fried
yes,
that's
precisely
what
it's
my
intention
to
do,
because
my
view
is
that
there
is
no
doctrine
and
no
provision
of
the
constitution
which
supports
the
argument
which
petitioner
has
made.
the
framers
considered
an
incompatibility
clause,
for
judges,
and
rejected...
they
omitted
to
enact
one,
although
they
did
enact
one
for
members
of
congress.
nor
was
this
an
oversight,
there
are--
mr.
charles
fried
--as
a
matter
of
policy
and
judgement,
that
is
a
very
reasonable
concern.
but
we
are
talking
about
constitutional--
mr.
charles
fried
--i
think
that
in
extremes
policing
the
margins,
perhaps
it
does.
but
i
am
struck
by
the
fact
that
chief
justice
jay
served
for
six
months
as
secretary
of
state
as
did
chief
justice
marshall.
mr.
charles
fried
i
don't
know,
but
chief
justice
marshall,
i
believe,
signed
the
commission
which
was
the
subject
of
mawbry
v.
madison.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
i
am
quite--
mr.
charles
fried
--the
matter
was
discussed,
and
the
only
case
which
i
know
of
which
discussed
it
at
some
length
is
united
states
v.
ferreira,
and
i
think
it's
quite
striking
what
the
court
said
in
that
case.
petitioner
says
that
ferreira
claims
that
the
court
refused
to
allow...
i'm
quoting
here
from
their
brief...
article
iii
judges
to
pass
or
claims
such
as
we're
involved
in.
what
the
court
actually
said
in
ferreira
was
that
the
authority
conferred
on
respective
judges
was
nothing
more
than
as
a
commissioner
to
adjust
certain
claims.
nor
can
we
see
any
ground
for
objection
for
the
power
in
that
case.
that's
what
this
court
said,
and
when
this
court
in
ferreira
considered
the
matter,
they
xx.
mr.
charles
fried
i
doubt
it.
mr.
charles
fried
i
doubt
it.
mr.
charles
fried
because
at
some
point,
you
reach
the
point
where
what
you've
done
is
impaired
the
ability
of
the
judiciary
to
function.
mr.
charles
fried
i
think
the
two
begin
to
merge,
at
the
point
you
mentioned.
mr.
charles
fried
i
think
there
is
some
limit.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
i
think
it
is
gathered
from
the
principles
of
the
constitution,
but
the
practice--
mr.
charles
fried
--yes,
yes,
it
is.
but
the
practice
of
distinguished
chief
justices
of
this
court,
and
the
words
of
this
court
indicate
that
those
limits
are
nowhere
near
as
tightly
drawn
as
petitioners
would
suggest.
indeed,
petitioner
draws
the
limits
very
tightly,
very
tightly,
and
i
think
that
the
practice
and
doctrines
of
this
court
clearly
indicate
that
that
tight
a
drawing
has
no
basis.
i
simply
don't
want,
and
it
would
imprudent,
to
suggest
there
are
no
limits.
if
there
are
limits,
of
course
they
are
constitutional
limits.
so,
to
that
extent,
i
would
certainly
agree.
mr.
charles
fried
no
judge
was
required
to
serve,
and
one
can
see
how--
mr.
charles
fried
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
and
if
the
requirement
of
three
judges
were
thought
to
be
an
impediment,
that
indeed
would
be
easily
cured.
congress
could
simply
indicate
in
the
legislative
history
that
it
would
be
loathe
to
confirm
a
commission
which
did
not
include
three
judges,
and
you
would
be
at
the
same
place.
mr.
charles
fried
yes,
one
of
the
judges
is
a
senior
judge,
and
there
was
a
question
about
whether
that
would
be
all
right,
and
the
matter
was
adjusted
to
make
sure
that
it
would
be
all
right.
that's
very
useful.
mr.
charles
fried
i
think
that
would
create
a
grave
problem
of
the
sort
justice
kennedy
raises,
and
a
different
case.
i
would
not
want
to
say
that
for
instance,
the
sinking
fund
commission,
on
which
chief
justice
jay
served
ex
officio
as
chief
justice,
along
with
the
secretary
of
state
and
the
secretary
of
treasury,
was
un-constitutional,
though
it
was
a
matter
considered
by
those
who
were
such
closer
to
the
framing
than
we
are--
mr.
charles
fried
--justice
scalla,
that
is
of
course
not
this
case,
but
let's
think
why
that
would
be
bad,
because
my
instinct
is
as
yours;
it
would
be.
i
think
what
would
be
bad
would
come
out
if
they
designated
the
second
most
junior
associate
justice
and
you
simply
refused
to
serve.
what
would
happen
then?
could
they
issue
a
writ
of
mandamus?
would
your
vote
be
counted
as
present,
although
you
were
never
there?
all
of
those
circumstances
suggest
that
in
enforcing
such
a
mandate,
they
would
run
afoul
of
one
or
another--
mr.
charles
fried
--yes,
i
think
that...
i
don't
think
it's
cruel
and
unusual
problem
this
time.
i
think
that
is
correct.
[laughter]
mr.
charles
fried
i
gave
my
judgment.
in
my
judgment,
this
prevents
me
from
being
a
judge.
i
suppose
that
if
the
chief
justice
declined
to
serves,
as
he
is
by
statute
designated
to
do,
on
the
board
of
the
national
gallery,
or
the
smithsonian
institution,
i
don't
think
that
he
could
be
compelled
to
do
so,
and
that
i
think
is
the
answer
to
justice
scalla's
question.
now,--
mr.
charles
fried
--well,
i
must
admit
to
you,
the
question
is
a
fresh
one
to
me.
i
right
offhand
can
see
no
objection
to
it,
and
in
fact--
mr.
charles
fried
--chairman
wilkens,
at
the
time
of
his
designation,
was
a
district
judge,
and
therefore
suffered
a
n
increase
in
his
salary.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
that
is
a
preference
which
he
can
show
today,
not
to
members
of
this
court,
and
certainly
not
to
the
chief
justice,
but
even
today
the
possibility
of
promotion,
if
it
is
a
promotion--
mr.
charles
fried
--well,
unless
we
beg
the
question,
so
is
this.
the
question
of
promotion
from
a
district
bench
to
a
court
of
appeals
bench.
i
thank
the
court
for
its
attention.
