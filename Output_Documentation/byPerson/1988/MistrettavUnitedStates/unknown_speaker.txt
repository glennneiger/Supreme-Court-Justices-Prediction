unknown
speaker
mr.
morrison,
was
the
commission
circumscribed
at
all
by
the
outside
limits
of
the
penalties
already
prescribed
by
law?
unknown
speaker
you
take
the
position
that
no
commission,
regardless
of
its
composition,
could
have
been
given
that
power,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
and
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
that,
then
you
fall
back
on
the
fact
that
it's
the
composition
of
the
commission?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
it
make
a
difference
if
the
law
did
not
require
that
judges
serve
on
the
commission?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
the
president
under
a
law
that
didn't
specify
that
judges
would
have
to
serve...
and
what
if
the
president
in
fact
asked
some
to
serve,
and
they
said,
"all
right,
we
will".
unknown
speaker
even
as
true
volunteers,
when
it
isn't
mandated?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
owen
roberts
on
the
pearl
harbor
commission,
earl
warren
on
the
warren
commission?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
practice
amounts
to
nothing
in
determining
constitutionality?
unknown
speaker
well,
as
long
as
we're
giving
you
these
examples,
what
about
the
federal
rules
of
evidence?
suppose
that
this
court
had
promulgated
the
federal
rules
of
evidence.
would
that
have
been
constitutional?
unknown
speaker
and
is
the
historical
occurrence
that
congress
old
enact
the
privileges
support
for
your
position?
unknown
speaker
is
this
argument
to
say
that
the
commission
is
treading
on
judicial,
the
power
of
individual
judges?
unknown
speaker
but
individual
judges
have
always
been
deciding
what
the
sentence
should
be
within
the
statutory
range.
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
in
that
process,
they
have
certainly
been
making
their
own
value
judgments
about
the
seriousness
of
the
crime.
unknown
speaker
that's
true.
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
wrong
with...
put
your
finger
on
what's
wrong
with
the
commission
doing
it.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
they
aren't...
the
judges
aren't
doing...
the
commission,
including
the
judges
on
the
commission,
aren't
doing
things
that
judges
don't
do,
or
that
are
improper
for
judges
to
do.
your
argument
sounds
like
it's
really
the
fact
that
the
commission
is
doing
it
and
interfering
with
judge's
judgement
in
individual
cases.
unknown
speaker
what's
wrong
with
that?
unknown
speaker
so
practice
really
does
make
a
difference?
unknown
speaker
you
could
say
the
same
thing
in
the
hampton
case.
there
had
never
been
an
independent
agency
before,
so
the
court
should
have
thrown
out
the
whole
idea
of
independent
agencies.
there's
going
to
be
a
first
time
for
lots
of
things.
unknown
speaker
even
though
they've
always
been
doing
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
haven't
they
always
been
deciding
what
the
sentence
should
be
within
the
statutory
range?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
it's
the
kind
of
judgments
that
judges
have
always
been
making.
judges
always
make
these
judgments.
now,
you
say
the
commission
shouldn't
be
making
it
to
apply
to
every
case,
but
the
fact
of
them
making
the
judgments
is
not
non-judicial
business.
unknown
speaker
well,
everybody
would
agree
to
that.
unknown
speaker
but
what's
wrong?
what's
un-constitutional
about
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
morrison,
judges
generally
have
for
many
years...
even
before
the
sherman
act...
decided
in
an
individual
case
whether
a
particular
combination
or
conspiracy
was
in
unlawful
restraint
of
trade,
haven't
they?
unknown
speaker
and
you
wouldn't
maintain
that
they
can
take
it
upon
themselves
to
write
a
new
sherman
act,
therefore,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
it's
a
different
job,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
morrison,
have
you
taken
into
consideration
the
large
city
courts
where
they
have
committees
of
judges
that
meet
with
the
sentencing
judge?
unknown
speaker
where
one
judge
calls
in
two
other
judges
to
tell
him...
sit
down
and
decide
what
we're
going
to
do.
unknown
speaker
and
that's
recognized
as
being
valid
and
good.
unknown
speaker
it
certainly
is
legal
and
valid,
and
has
been
in
existence
for
20
years
or
more.
unknown
speaker
what
happens
if
you
and
i
sit
down
to
decide,
and
i
don't
agree
with
you,
and
the
next
time
we
sit
down,
do
you
think
you're
going
to
agree
with
me?
unknown
speaker
you
wanna
bet?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
in
another
sense
that
every
time
a
federal
judge
hands
down
some
ruling
on
a
point
of
law,
they're
binding
others
not
before
the
court,
aren't
they?
unknown
speaker
and
in
a
sense
they're
establishing
precedent?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
in
a
very
real
sense,
judges
generally
are
in
the
business,
at
least
at
the
federal
level,
of
making
a
good
deal
of
law,
in
a
sense.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
does
any
of
them
include
the
argument
you're
just
making?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
speaks
in
favor
of
the
solicitor-general's
argument
that
in
fact
this
is
executive
power
being
exercised.
unknown
speaker
xxx--
unknown
speaker
--in
all
cases?
unknown
speaker
the
judges
to
follow?
unknown
speaker
well,
when
the
court
of
appeals
decides
a
case,
and
in
effect
makes
some
new
law,
or
makes
new
policy,
it
certainly
binds
every
judge
in
the
circuit.
unknown
speaker
and
at
the
trial
court--
unknown
speaker
--and
i
won't
say
what
happens
if
we
decide
it.
[laughter]
well,
how
about
the
judicial
councils?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
judgement
congress
did
make.
congress
didn't
leave
that
judgement
to
the
commission.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
mr.
morrison,
what
if
the
judges
in
a
particular
circuit
got
together
and
decided
that
in
order
to
improve
the
operation
of
the
criminal
system
in
their
circuit,
they
would
develop
for
themselves
some
sentencing
guidelines,
within
the
ranges
established
by
congress,
and
they'd
try
to
get
xx
l
their
colleagues
to
follow
them.
is
that
improper?
invalid?
unknown
speaker
mr.
morrison,
can
i
interrupt
with
one
question?
if
the
program
had
been
one
that
made
the
sentencing
guidelines
a
recommendation
to
congress,
in
effect,
and
congress
had
then
adopted
them--
unknown
speaker
--would
there
be
any
constitutional
objection?
unknown
speaker
what
you're
saying
is
it
would
still
be
un-constitutional
even
though
no
one
could
challenge
it?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
the
undermine--
--before
a
committee
of
congress
about
a
substantive
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
a
judge
wants
to
testify
about
some
pending
bill
that
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
judiciary?
it
may
be
very
bad
judgement,
but
surely
he
isn't
violating
the
constitution.
unknown
speaker
and
what
provision
in
the
constitution
is
it
that
prevents
a
judge
from
going
over
and
testifying
about
a
bill
for
appropriation
for
a
wildlife
center?
unknown
speaker
but
we
were
talking
about
a
court
there.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
just
pure
metaphysics.
unknown
speaker
that's
like
saying
guns
don't
kill
people,
people
kill
people.
[laughter]
mr.
morrison,
while
you're
thinking
about
that--
unknown
speaker
yes.
what
about
a
judge
testifying
about
sentencing?
testifying
in
opposition
to
capital
punishment,
for
example?
unknown
speaker
you
think
he
would
be
acting
in
violation--
unknown
speaker
--may
they
vote?
unknown
speaker
and
what
if
the
judge
if
asked
by
a--
unknown
speaker
--i
didn't
ask
that.
unknown
speaker
but
what
if
a
congressional
committee
dealing
with
a
sentencing
problem
wanted
to
call
in
judges
and
ask
them
for
the
reasons
they'd
imposed
a
series
of
sentences
in
cases,
just
to
better
understand
the
sentencing
process?
you
tell
me
that
the
judges
could
not
respond
to
that
request.
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
the
difference,
though?
unknown
speaker
i
think
you
said
your
position
would
actually
carry
to
the
extent
that
even
if
it
did
not
become
the
law,
it
was
subject
to
further
enactment
by
congress,
you
would
still
object
to
this
whole
process.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
you
said
you
think
it's
un-constitutional
for
them
to
do
it.
unknown
speaker
i
wish
you
hadn't
said
that.
we
don't
really
have
to
get
into
that.
unknown
speaker
it's
quite
a
bit
different
being
a
member
of
an
agency
that
promulgates
law,
which
is
what
you
say
is
the
problem
here--
unknown
speaker
--from
testifying
before
congress.
we
really
have
to
reach
that
problem
today?
unknown
speaker
but
the
problem
is,
they've
been
enjoined
to
do
it
for
every
case.
unknown
speaker
you're
making
a
non-delegation
argument,
is
that
it
right
not?
unknown
speaker
general
fried,
do
you
know
of
any
other
agency...
let's
say
this
is
in
the
executive
branch...
do
you
know
of
any
other
agency
in
the
executive
branch
that
has
no
function
whatever
except
to
promulgate
law?
unknown
speaker
indeed,
just
as
rulemaking
is
almost
a
necessary
incident
of
being
an
executive.
you
must
acknowledge...
this
is
a
distinctive
entity.
has
there
ever
teen
an
agency
of
the
government
that
has
no
function
except
to
promulgate
law,
other
than
the
congress?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
so.
unknown
speaker
in
the
course
of
conducting
some
administrative
function
or
other...
some
other
executive
function.
unknown
speaker
that's
true,
but
i
assume
that
if
congress
could
do
this,
congress
could
decide
that
we
need
a
massive
revision
of
securities
laws,
and
could
simply
compose
a
commission,
so
long
as
the
directives
are
general
enough
to
overcome
the
bare
objections
we
have
against
overdelegation...
assuming
that
there's
enough
standard
there,
it
could
just
create
a
commission
and
say
that
whatever
this
commission
comes
out
with
shall
be
our
new
securities
laws.
can
it
do
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
certainly
is
a
nice...
it's
a
handy
way
to
get
around
legislative
impasse.
you
just
create
an
agency
to
make
law,
right?
unknown
speaker
but
if
this
handy
device
is
doable,
why
has
it
never
been
done
before?
i
mean,
it
certainly
is
handy.
unknown
speaker
to
just
simply
say,
why
go
through
all
the
trouble
of
hammering
cut
a
new
securities
law?
let's
just
create
an
agency
and
say,
hey,
promulgate
a
securities
law.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
could
be
that
a
certain
amount
of
lawmaking
can
be
given
to
executive
agencies
because
it
inevitably
belongs
to
them,
just
as
a
certain
amount
of
lawmaking
is
given
to
courts.
it's
part
of
their
executive
function,
and
you
can
augment
it
to
a
certain
degree.
and
perhaps
that's
permissible,
but
it's
not
permissible
to
create
an
agency
that
has
no
function
except
to
promulgate
a
law.
unknown
speaker
if
all
it
does
is
promulgate
a
law,
what
kind
of
action
would
you
call
that?
unknown
speaker
you
would?
unknown
speaker
it's
been
suggested
that
that
one
thing
was
that
congress
didn't
adopt
it
afterwards.
unknown
speaker
they
have
adopted
the
act?
unknown
speaker
it
could
do
it
right
now,
could
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--but
you
wouldn't
have
had
this
headache
and
this
lawsuit.
unknown
speaker
general
fried,
if
there
is
a
concern...
and
i
submit
there
is...
about
preserving
the
independence
and
the
impartiality
of
the
judiciary,
it
really
doesn't
make
any
difference
which
branch
this
is
under,
does
it?
that
concern
is
the
same.
unknown
speaker
when
you
do
that,
will
you
please
tell
me
whether
or
not
in
your
view
the
value
of
impartiality
and
independence
is
a
value
that's
protected
by
the
doctrine
of
separation
of
powers?
unknown
speaker
would
you
concede
that
the
frequent
and
continuous
service
by
judges
on
rulemaking
and
lawmaking
commissions
might
impair
the
impartiality
and
the
integrity
of
the
judiciary
in
the
minds
of
the
public?
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
the
constitution
has
no
concern
and
no
provisions
to
protect
against
that
encroachment?
unknown
speaker
how
many
cases
were
pending
at
that
time,
chief
justice?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
what
strikes
me
about
this
argument,
general
fried...
it
seems
to
me
what
is
remarkable
if
there
is
no
impediment...
as
you
say,
there
is
not...
what
is
remarkable
is
that
not
that
this
is
happening
sometimes,
but
that
it
has
happened
so
rarely.
it
there
has
been
no
felt
impediment
to
members
of
the
judiciary
serving
in
executive
positions,
i'm
amazed
that
you
can
come
up
with
no
more
than
the
number
of
examples
that
you've
brought
before
us.
unknown
speaker
there
are
very
capable
men
and
women
in
the
judiciary
over
the
years,
and
that
so
few
of
them
should
have
thought
that
they
had
the
time
and
the
ability
to
lend
to
the
public
service
in
the
executive
branch
strikes
me
as
extraordinary.
unknown
speaker
so
that
congress
could
provide
that
every
day,
every
judge
in
the
united
states
spends
his
morning
on
a
commission
and
the
afternoon
on
an
article
iii
bench?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
why,
if
there
is
no
constitutional
prohibition?
unknown
speaker
just
from
the
standpoint
of
their
workload,
or
from
the
standpoint
of
their
reputation
for
impartiality
and
independence?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
the
limiting
principle
is
that
there
is
some
limitation
on
whether
or
not
the
independence
and
the
impartiality
of
the
judges
can
be
impaired
by
a
delegation.
unknown
speaker
and
it's
in
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
a
constitutional
doctrine?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
no
judge
in
this
case
was
required
to
serve
at
all.
unknown
speaker
if
all
of
them,
if
every
judge
who
was
asked
to
serve
had
refused,
the
commission
could
never
have
been
constituted.
unknown
speaker
wasn't
at
least
one
of
the
judges
a
senior
judge?
wasn't
george
mckenna,
a
senior
judge?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
from
what
you
say,
general
fried,
that
if
the
statute
provided
that
the
president
could
appoint
a
designated
judge,
and
the
judge
would
be
required
to
serve,
that
you
would
agree
that
would
be
un-constitutional.
unknown
speaker
general
fried,
i
guess
you're
right
that
it
certainly
will
make
us
feel
better
about
it
if
you
tell
us
we
cant
be
appointed
to
some
things,
whether
we
like
it
or
not,
but
i'm
not
sure
i
see
the
basis
for
a
constitutional
distinction.
if
we
approve
this,
why?
why
can't...
if
it's,
somehow
a
violation
of
separation
of
powers,
i
don't
know
why
it
makes
any
difference
whether
the
initiative
comes
from
the
congress
or
from
us?
whether
i
volunteer
for
this
violative
service,
or
am
enlisted
into
it,
i
don't
know
what
difference
that
should
make.
unknown
speaker
sort
of
a
first
amendment
entanglement
problem?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
it
might
be
a
separation
of
powers
argument,
if
a
judge
said,
well
you
can't
do
this
to
me,
because
i
was
appointed
a
judge,
and
you're
going
to
keep
me
from
being
a
judge.
unknown
speaker
it's
a
small
point,
perhaps,
general
fried,
but
on
the
salary,
could
congress
provide
that
service
or
one
of
these
commissions
entitles
the
judge
to
a
$25,000
increase
for
service
on
the
commission?
now
you're
hitting
it.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i
wouldn't
worry
a
lot
about
that
problem.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
the
objection
in
the
delightful
hypothetical,
i
propose,
that
the
president
could
prefer
some
judges
over
others?
is
this
an
interference
with
the
independence
of
the
judiciary?
unknown
speaker
that's
provided
for
in
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
as
courts,
it
was
the
court's
responsibility
to
sentence.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
may
have
decided
they
wanted
to
fetter
it.
congress
wanted
to
fetter
the
power
that
individual
judges
had
been
exercising,
because
they
are
the
ones
who
created
the
problem.
they
are
the
ones
who
gave
the
disparate
sentences
all
around
the
country.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
not
a
guideline
at
all.
i
mean,
i
could
depart
from
it
tomorrow.
even
the
same
judge
could
go
over
to
a
different
methodology
the
next
case,
couldn't
he?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
call...
i
don't
call
that
lawmaking,
to
decide
a
particular
case,
that
this
defendant
will
get
15
years.
i
don't
call
that
making
a
law.
i
call
making
a
law,
all
defendants
that
have
this
characteristic
will
get
15
years.
that's
a
law.
but
saying
that
this
defendant
will
get
15
years...
that's
not
a
law
at
all.
that's
the
decision
of
a
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
we're
using
law
in
two
different
senses.
you're
not
using
it
in
the
relevant
sense
here,
it
seems
to
me.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
that
congress
told
the
courts,
that
congress
created
a
commission
with
judges
on
it,
judges
only,
to
promulgate
rules
for
damages
in
libel
cases.
now,
really,
professor,
the
whole
justification
for
our
making
law
at
all...
and
we
do
all
the
time...
is
because
we
must
do
so
in
order
to
decide
a
case.
and
that's
not
what
the
sentencing
guidelines
are.
unknown
speaker
limits
on
sentencing...
the
limits
or
what
an
individual
judge
could
do
in
imposing
a
sentence,
has
always
been
the
prerogative
of
the
congress,
hasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
the
prerogative
of
the
congress.
the
pronouncement
of
the
sentence
has
always
been
for
the
judge,
to
be
sure,
but
the
limits
within
which
the
judge
is
permitted
to
operate
in
imposing
the
sentence
has
until
now
been
with
the
congress,
has
it
not?
unknown
speaker
i'm
just
asking
whether
up
until
now
it
is
not
true
that
the
limits
within
which
each
individual
judge
had
to
maneuver
in
imposing
a
sentence
has
been
up
to
the
congress.
and
the
effect
of
this
legislation
is
to
place
those
limits
within
this
commission.
unknown
speaker
the
commission
has
established
new,
lower,
maximums...
has
establishing
new,
lower
maximum
sentences
for
certain
offenses.
unknown
speaker
some
offenses
which
the
statute
says
can
be
sentenced
to
30
years,
some
of
those
the
commission
has
said,
given
certain
circumstances,
the
maximum
can
only
be
20.
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
but
he
couldn't
say
that
another
district
judge
couldn't
sentence
to
30
years.
he
could
say
that
he
couldn't,
or
that
he
wouldn't.
