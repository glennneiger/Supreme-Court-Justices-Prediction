mr.
alan
b.
morrison
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines,
or
more
precisely,
the
constitutionality
of
the
process
by
which
those
guidelines
were
issued.
to
answer
the
question,
it
is
necessary
to
know
how
the
guideline
system
works,
and
what
kind
of
judgments
went
into
the
guidelines.
in
1984,
congress
instituted
a
new
system
of
determinative
sentencing.
in
that
determinative
sentencing
system,
it
made
sentencing
guidelines
the
centerpiece.
it
also
recognized
that
it
could
not...
chose
not
to
issue
the
guidelines
itself.
rather,
it
designated
in
a
statute
of
commission
to
do
the
job.
the
commission
to
consist
of
seven
members,
three
of
whom
were
required
to
be
article
3
federal
judges,
all
of
whom
were
appointed
by
the
president
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate,
and
no
more
than
four
of
them
could
be
members
of
the
same
political
party.
now,
the
term
guidelines,
which
is
what
the
commission
is
directed
to
issue,
is
something
of
a
misnomer.
these
guidelines
are
not
merely
advisory.
they
are
directions
to
sentencing
judges
with
which
the
sentencing
judges
must
comply,
unless
they
find
that
there
is
a
factor
in
the
particular
case
which
the
sentencing
commission
did
not
adequately
take
into
account.
and
if
the
sentencing
judge
diverts
from
the
guidelines,
either
above
or
below
the
guideline,
then
the
party...
either
the
defendant
or
the
government...
has
a
right
of
appeal
on
the
grounds
that
the
sentence
was
unreasonably
either
too
high
or
too
low.
similarly
for
the
first
time
ever,
both
defendant
and
the
government
has
a
right
to
appeal
if
they
allege
that
the
court
selected
an
improper
guideline
or
otherwise
misapplied
the
guidelines.
there
is
no
dispute
between
the
parties
that
the
guidelines
constitute
the
law
of
sentencing
for
federal
defendants
from
november
1,
1987
on,
which
is
the
effective
date
for
the
guidelines
for
crimes
committed
after
that
date.
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
guidelines
are
consistent
with
separation
of
powers,
it's
necessary
to
examine
the
kind
of
judgments
that
the
commission
inevitably
had
to
make
in
establishing
a
guidelines
system.
the
first
question
that
the
commission
had
to
confront
with
respect
to
each
of
the
crimes...
and
this
is
not
simply
the
title
xviii,
but
all
of
the
entire
federal
criminal
code,
and
other
provisions
in
other
parts
of
the
united
states
code...
where
should
the
sentence
be?
congress
told
the
commission
that
the
sentencing
range
for
each
sentence
could
be
no
more
than
six
months
or
25
percent
maximum
to
minimum
jail
time.
so,
for
instance,
for
the
crime
of
stealing
a
$500
social
security
check
in
the
mail,
the
commission
had
to
decide
what
the
appropriate
punishment
was
for
that
particular
crime.
did
it
matter
the
commission
had
to
decide
whether
the
thief
was
caught
before
he
spent
the
money,
or
whether
the
amount
of
the
check
was
not
$500,
but
$1,000,
and--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--yes,
your
honor.
yes,
your
honor.
the
commission
also
had
to
decide
whether
those
similar
kinds
of
monetary
adjustments
were
appropriate
for
other
kinds
of
crimes
against
property,
for
crimes
such
as
tax
evasion,
for
price
fixing,
securities
fraud,
and
the
like.
congress
told
the
commission,
"start
with
the
average
sentences
imposed
in
the
past,
but
that
you
can
move
them
up
or
down
as
you
see
fit
in
order
to
eliminate
what
congress
said
were
unwarranted
disparities."
so,
the
commission
had
to
decide
what
factors
were
properly
aggravating
and
what
properly
mitigating
in
a
particular
crime
to
decide
whether
the
particular
differences
were
warranted
or
unwarranted.
that
is
precisely
the
kind
of
process
that
sentencing
judges
used
to
do,
before
the
commission
issued
its
guidelines
and
they
went
into
effect.
the
second
major
task
that
the
commission
had
to
undertake
was
it
had
to
rank
the
seriousness
of
disparate
kinds
of
offenses.
it
was
not
simply
enough
to
decide
the
absolute
offence
level
for
each
crime,
but
as
a
practical
matter,
you
had
to
rank
the
crimes
in
comparative
degree
of
seriousness.
so
for
instance,
the
commission
had
to
face
questions
rather
like
this:
how
should
you
punish
the
sale
of
six
ounces
of
cocaine,
the
committing
of
perjury
before
congress,
bid
rigging
in
excess
of
$50
million
in
government
contracts,
the
sale
of
$100
in
pornographic
materials,
or
conspiracy
to
violate
the
civil
rights
of
a
black
family.
the
commission
chose,
within
the
statutory
range
of
sentencing,
to
treat
all
of
those
disparate
offenses
basically
the
same,
and
that
question
of
how
to
treat
them
was
a
question
that
they
had
to
address,
despite
the
very
dissimilar
facts
surrounding
each
of
the
crimes.
it
is
of
course
not
the
function
of
the
court
to
decide
whether
those
analogous
sentences
for
different
crimes
is
right
or
wrong.
but
it's
important
to
note
these
because
it
indicates
the
kind
of
ranking
of
judgments
that
the
commission
made,
these
very
heavily
policy-oriented
judgments
that
are
plainly
debatable,
and
that
the
terms
of
these
debates
are
about
values
and
about
policies,
and
they
are
political
in
the
best
sense
of
the
word...
the
kinds
of
political
choices
that
we
normally
expect
will
be
made
by
our
political
branches.
this
ranking
of
offenses,
is
inevitable,
any
time
you
have
a
base
level
system,
which
they
had
to
have
in
this
case,
between
1
and
43.
and
while
the
guidelines
themselves
don't
show
the
ranking,
the
equal
ranking
of
disparate
crimes,
we
have
attached
an
addendue
to
our
brief,
which
goes
through
each
base
level
offense
and
shows
you
what
the
commission
determined
to
be
similar
crimes
and
hence
deserving
of
similar
punishments.
there
are,
in
short,
no
neutral
principles
that
the
commission
could
follow,
except
its
own
good
sense
and
personal
views
about
which
crimes
were
more
serious
or
less
serious
than
the
others.
the
commission
recognized
in
a
number
of
places
that
it
was
making
policy
decisions,
most
particularly
in
the
policy
decisions
to
substantially
increase
the
amount
of
time
which
persons
convicted
of
white-collar
crime,
such
as
tax
evasion,
public
corruption,
anti-trust
violations,
securities
fraud,
would
spend
in
jail.
the
third
set
of
determinations,
that
the
commission
and
to
make
was
to
decide
who
gets
to
go
on
probation
and
who
doesn't
get
to
go
on
probation.
under
the
statues,
the
commission
was
empowered
to
lay
down
the
ground
rules,
and
say
below
a
certain
level,
probation
is
permissible,
but
above
that
level,
it
is
not
permissible.
and
the
district
judge
who
sentences
the
individual
is
forbidden
from
giving
probation
to
someone
whom
the
commission
said
was
not
entitled
to
probation
for
that
kind
of
crime,
just
as
much
as
the
district
judge
is
forbidden
from
going
above
or
below
the
sentencing
guidelines.
there
is,
i
believe,
a
graphic
example
of
the
effect
that
the
commission's
judgments
have
on
sentencing,
and
how
the
commission's
judgments
reflect
its
views
about
what
kind
of
penalties
are
appropriate
for
what
kind
of
crime.
and
the
example
i
refer
to
is
that
of
the
recent
sentence
of
michael
deaver.
mr.
deaver
was
convicted
of
committing
three
counts
of
perjury.
assume
for
simplicity
it's
only
one
count,
because
the
guidelines
become
more
confusing
when
there
are
multiple
counts...
another
matter
which
the
commission
had
to
deal
with.
now,
under
the
commission's
guidelines,
a
single
count
of
perjury
is
a
base
level
12
offense.
because
mr.
deaver
had
no
prior
convictions,
that
would
translate
into
a
range
of
sentence
between
10
and
16
months
confinement.
under
the
commission's
guidelines,
alcoholism,
which
was
a
factor
cited
in
mitigation,
would
not
have
been
an
excuse
to
go
below
the
10
months.
it
would
have
been
a
proper
basis
for
the
judge
to
consider,
within
the
10
to
16
month
range.
now,
of
that
10
months,
the
sentencing
commission
said
five
had
to
be
spent
in
actual
confinement...
no
straight
probation,
actual
confinement.
and
five
could
have
been
served
in
community
confinement,
which
means
a
person
can
go
out
during
the
day
and
goes
to
a
halfway
house
or
similar
facility
in
the
evening.
in
actuality,
the
district
judge
in
this
case
gave
mr.
deaver
three
years
jail
time,
but
suspended
it
entirely.
under
the
sentencing
guidelines,
he
could
not
have
done
that.
now,
again,
the
question
is
not
which
set
of
judgments
is
right
or
wrong,
the
sentencing
commission's
judgments
or
the
district
court's
judgments.
the
point
for
these
purposes
is
to
recognize
that
the
judgment
depends
about
your
notions
about
this
relative
seriousness
of
the
crime.
what
kind
of
offenses
should
people
in
all
cases
have
to
go
to
jail
for?
and
this
commission
has
made
those
judgments
in
every
one
of
the
cases
in
which
it
has
written
a
sentencing
guideline
for.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that
is
the
second
argument
we
make.
we
make
the
argument
on
delegation
as
our
second
argument,
given
the
definitions
and
the
relatively
few
limits
that
congress
has
placed
upon
the
commission.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
as
your
honor
notes,
those
are
alternative
arguments.
we
have
placed
the
sentencing...
let
me
see,
the
separation
of
powers
argument
first
in
our
brief
because
we
believe
it
is
a
lesser
argument...
that
is
to
say,
we
don't
have
to
say
that
necessarily
you
could
never
issue
sentencing
guidelines,
but
that
this
commission
with
this
composition,
these
powers
and
these
restrictions
couldn't
do
it.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it
would
make
a
difference
depending
upon
whether
judges
were
serving
on
the
commission
or
not.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
in
my
view,
that
is
un-constitutional
as
well.
that
is
not
permissible,
to
have
article
3
judges
serving
on
commission
of
this
kind.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
think
that...
yes,
that
is
also
correct,
your
honor,
because
of
the
nature
of
the
kind
of
choices
that
the
commission
was
making.
the
thrust
of
my
submission
that
i
have
been
making
here
in
trying
to
describe
the
work
of
the
commission
is
directly
relevant
on
both
the
separation
of
powers
issues...
because
the
court
has
looked
at
the
functions
being
performed...
as
well
as
the
delegation
issue,
and
that
factual
predicate
in
this
description
directly
bears
on
both
of
them,
and
not
simply
on
the
delegation
issue,
or
on
the
separation
of
powers
issue.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
believe
that
all...
that
many...
that
those
two
are
factually
distinguishable
on
the
grounds
that
they
involved
advice-giving
and
fact-finding.
but
the...
both
the
government
and
the
sentencing
commission
cite
a
number
of
historic
examples
about
other
kinds
of
activities
undertaken
by
various
justices
at
various
times.
while
i
think
there
are
some
distinctions
between
that
case
and
this
one,
principally
because
this
one
involves
the
making
of
law
in
a
concrete
situation...
the
most
important
distinction
for
our
purposes
is
that
in
none
of
those
examples
was
the
constitutionality
of
the
conduct
ever
taken
to
court,
let
alone
was
it
reviewed
under
this
court's
jurisprudence
on
separation
of
powers
as
it
has
evolved
since
buckley
in
1976.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
did
not
say
that,
your
honor.
i
would
not
agree
that
practice
amounts
to
nothing.
i
would
point
out,
however,
that
there
has
been
practice
to
the
contrary.
a
number
of
justices
expressed
extreme
reservations
about
doing
this,
and
while
not
directly
citing
separations
of
powers
situations
in
all
cases...
although
justice
stone
has
done
so...
i
would
say
that
dating
from
the
earliest
days
of
our
republic,
when
as
reported
in
united
states
v.
muskrat,
president
washington
asked
thomas
jefferson
as
secretary
of
state
to
ask
the
court
for
an
opinion
about
the
meaning
of
a
treaty.
those...
the
justices
declined
to
do
so
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
inappropriate.
i
would
suspect
that
it
they
had
been
asked
in
their
individual
capacities,
as
the
respondent
suggests,
as
opposed
to
their
official
capacity,
the
outcome
should
have
teen
the
same.
so,
i
think
that
the
history
is
by
no
means
unified
all
in
one
direction,
but
more
importantly,
i
believe
that
none
of
the
cases
ever
involved
activities
of
a
concrete,
far-reaching
nature
that
affects
40,000
criminal
defendants
a
year,
as
the
activities
of
the
sentencing
commission
do
here.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
let
me
divide
the
answer
into
two
parts,
if
i
may.
as
to
the
rules
not
relating
to
privilege,
i
would
say
that
there
would
be
no
difficulty,
that
those
are
very
close
to
the
rules
of
civil
procedure.
that
is,
of
course,
the
line
that
congress
ultimately
hit
upon.
this
court
did,
in
the
early
1970's,
pursuant
to
a
congressional
grant,
promulgate
the
rules
of
evidence,
sent
them
forward
to
congress.
congress
saw
them,
stopped
them
from
going
into
effect,
and
ultimately
said,
"you
can't
put
them
into
effect
as
to
privileges."
now,
dealing
with
the
privileges,
i
would
even
divide
that
into
two
parts.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
we
are
dealing
with
the
privileges
as
applies
to
federal
law
and
federal
causes
of
action
involving
federal
matters,
that
the
court
may
have
some
limited
authority
there.
but
what
i
believe
you
have,
in
the
case
of
privileges,
are
principally
questions
of
value
judgments.
do
we
value
the
confidence
between
the
husband
and
wife
greater
than
we
value
the
getting
at
truth?
how
do
we
value
the
attorney-client
privilege...
not
so
much
in
the
context
of
litigation,
but
in
terms
of
pre-litigation
matters?
and
it
is
my
view
that
that
is
a
far
closer
question...
and
i
think
if
i
had
to
come
down
on
it,
i
would
say
that
the
court
could
not
do
these...
at
least
certainly
many
of
the
privileges.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
i
would
like
to
say
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
it
probably
had
to
do
more
with
a
recognition
of
the
underlying
nature
of
the
controversies
in
the
privilege
area...
that
is,
we
are
dealing
with
policy
choices
that
are
more
substantive
in
nature
than
procedural.
i
recognize
that
in
recent
years
the
court
has
said...
i
mean,
just
last
term...
that
there
is
no
single
dividing
line
between
substance
and
procedure.
but,
on
the
other
hand,
the
court
has
recognized
in
a
number
of
cases
when
persons
have
tried
to
claim
something
as
procedural
to
be
able
to
drag
it
in
on
the
judicial
side,
the
court
has
said,
"no,
we
won't
allow
that
to
take
place."
so,
i
think
that
the
efforts
to
expand
procedural
have...
albeit
in
a
different
context...
have
generally
not
met
with
favor,
and
i
would
think
that
they
would
not
apply
here
to
the
evidence
context
as
well.
turning
back
to
the
work
of
the
commission,
the
commission
also
had
to
deal
with
the
question
of
fines
within
the
statutory
restrictions.
the
commission
was
given
the
discretion
to
decide
under
what
circumstances
fines
should
be
imposed,
when
and
how
much.
originally
the
commission
thought
about
having
an
ability-to-pay
fine
system,
or
is
the
alternative,
a
system
based
on
a
multiplier
of
the
amount
of
money
lost.
the
commission
is
even
now
about
to
hold
some
hearings
dealing
with
fines
for
organizations,
principally
corporate
defendants.
but,
in
the
end,
as
to
individuals,
it's
set
up
a
schedule
under
which
all
but
the
incident
must
pay
fines
in
an
amount
within
the
range
set
forth
in
the
schedule.
so,
turning
back
again
to
the
michael
deaver
example,
at
the
base
level
offense
of
12,
mr.
deaver
could
have
been
required
to
pay
a
fine
of
between
$3,000
and
$30,000.
in
fact,
he
was
fined
a
$100,000,
and
again,
the
answer...
the
question
is,
of
course,
not
which
set
of
fines
is
correct,
but
it
shows
how
value-laden
that
part
of
the
system
is
as
well.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it
is
certainly
the
fact
that
the
commission
treads
on
the
power
of
individual
judges.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
in
the
context
of
a
case
or
controversy,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
but
they
have
done
it
for
the
one
individual
before
the
court.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
they
have
not
laid
down
precedent.
and
the
fact
that
they
were
doing
it
for
only
the
individual
before
the
court
was
the
very
fault
that
the
congress
found
with
the
present
system,
and
the
reason
that
they
wanted
to
change
it.
congress
didn't
like
the
individual--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--the
commission
is
improperly
doing
it
here
because
we
have
a
commission
which
includes
three
article
3
judges
in
the
judicial
branches.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
your
honor.
i
want
to
be
precise
in
what
i'm
saying.
it
is
of
course
true
that
judges
have
always
engaged
in
sentencing,
but
sentencing
is
not
a
unified
act.
it's
composed
of
several
different
elements.
the
imposition
of
a
particular
sentence
in
a
particular
case
is
what
judges
have
been
doing.
what
the
judges
and
the
other
members
of
the
commission
are
doing
here
is,
they
are
writing
the
rules
of
sentencing
not
to
apply
to
themselves,
but
to
apply
to
all
judges.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
because
they
have
historically
never
done
that
before,
and
because
they
are
making--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--no,
and
because
they
are
making
policy
decisions
of
a
kind--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--yes,
your
honor.
but
i
simply
wanted
to
respond
to
justice
white's
statement
that
this
is
what
sentencing
judges
have
always
done.
it's
not
what
sentencing
judges
have
always
done,
and
you
are
right,
there
has
to
be
a
first
time.
and
my
argument
is
that
sentencing
judges
should
not
be
doing
this,
because--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--they
have
not--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--in
an
individual
case.
they
have
not
always
been
deciding
the
general
rule.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
there
may
be
less
difference
between
us
than
i
think
there
may
appear.
your
honor,
of
course
it
is
only
the
translation
of
the
making
of
these
judgments
on
an
across
the
board
basis
that
creates
the
problem.
but
i
do
think
that
there
is
a
difference
in
kind
between
laying
down
and
establishing
a
sentence
for
a
particular
individual
in
a
case,
and
laying
down
broad
rules
for--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--that--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--it
is
the
laying
down
of
the
broad
rules
that
causes
judges
to
be
embroiled
in
political
controversy.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
would
not.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
you're
talking
about
the
non-federal
system,
your
honor?
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes,
i'm
aware
of
that.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
it
has
never
been
challenged,
your
honor,
but
it
is
distinguishable
on
several
grounds.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it
certainly
has
been
in
existence.
it
has
never
been
challenged,
and
it
probably
is
not
challengeable,
but
there
is
a
major
difference,
and
that
is,
the
three
judges
sit
down,
and
they
have
a
meeting,
and
they
decide
what's
appropriate
for
sentence.
but
only
the
sentencing
judge
actually
decides.
a
judge
gets
advice
from
his
or
her
colleagues
and
decides
what's
appropriate.
it
is
not
binding.
that
system
was
known
to
the
congress,
and
it
was
one
of
the
things
that
congress
thought
might
happen--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--i
might,
or
i
might
not,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
but
it's
not
binding.
it's
not
binding,
and
that's
the
difference.
it's
the
difference
between
advice
which
the
congress
rejected
as
being
sufficient,
and
mandatory
binding
guidelines
subject
to
very
limited
exceptions,
and
that
is
the
reason
the
congress
felt
that
it
was
not
sufficient.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
your
honor,
it
is--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--yes,
your
honor,
but
the
rules
for
deviating
from
precedent,
particularly
by
one
judge
from
another
judge
in
another
circuit,
or
even
in
the
same
district,
are
far
less
stringent
and
do
not
give
rise
to
the
same
kind
of
rights
that
are
given
rise
to
when
a
judge
deviates
from
the
sentencing
guideline
in
this
case.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
they
make
law,
but
it's
not
binding.
i
would
give
the
example
in
this
very
case,
your
honor...
the
sentencing
guidelines
have
been
before,
i
think
it's
approximately
250
federal
judges,
who
have
voted
on
their
constitutionality.
i
do
not
have
the
latest
count,
i
think
it
is
slightly
more
than
50
percent
who
have
decided
they
are
un-constitutional,
and
less
than
50
percent
constitutional,
for
a
variety
of
different
reasons.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
many
of
them
include
my
argument.
some
of
them
include
delegation
arguments,
some
of
them
include
due
process
arguments,
some
of
them
include
arguments
i've
chosen
not
to
make.
there
are
a
whole
variety,
and
i
would
say
the
same
is
true
on
the
other
side.
there
have
been
cases
upheld
on
grounds
that
have
not
been
urged
by
the
parties.
the
point
i
make,
justice
o'connor,
is
to
indicate
that
at
least
in
this
particular
kind
of
controversy,
no
one
has
felt
bound
by
what
their
fellow
judges
have
done.
even
in
the
same
district
courts,
there
have
been
deviations
in
the
same
district
court,
and
there
have
been
different
defendants
being
sentenced
by
different
people
until
this
case
can
be
decided.
now,
the
policy
choices
that
this
commission
had
to
make
were
inevitable,
given
the
kind
of
functions
that
it
would
perform,
and
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
correct
in
describing
these
choices
as
political.
and
indeed,
that
is
what
the
congress
expected,
because
congress
proscribed
the
presence
of
more
than
four
members
of
the
commission
from
being
of
the
same
political
party.
that
kind
of
restriction,
which
is
extremely
common
in
executive
branch
agencies,
where
we
expect
our
executive
branch
officials
to
be
making
policy,
is
unique
in
the
judiciary,
and
it's
unique
in
the
judiciary
because
we
do
not
expect
those
bodies
in
the
judicial
branch
to
be
making
policy,
making
these
kind
of
political
choices.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
agree,
your
honor,
and
that
if
the
power
is
properly
delegable,
it
must
be
executive
power.
now,
the
solicitor-general
has
a
matter
which
i'm
sure
he
will
tend
to,
of
how
he's
going
to
move
the
commission
out
of
the
judicial
branch,
where
congress
so
carefully
placed
it,
into
the
executive
branch,
but
in
any
event...
and
i'd
like
to
turn
to
this
now,
if
i
may...
we
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference.
that
if
congress
had
placed
this
body
in
the
executive
branch
of
government,
labeled
it
3
judges
on
it,
we
don't
think
that
would
have
made
a
single
bit
of
difference,
and
it
would
have
been
just
as
unconstitutional
there
as
it
is
here.
and
the
reason
we
say
that
is
because
we
go
back
to
the
purposes
behind
separation
of
powers
for
the
judicial
branch
of
government.
that
the
founding
fathers
separated
the
judges
because
they
wanted
them
to
be
independent,
and
they
wanted
them
to
be
impartial.
and
they
were
specially
concerned
about
that
because
they
have
lifetime
appointments.
now,
it's
true
that
they
were
also
conscious
of
the
possibility
of
tyranny
developing
when
judges
were
involved
in
the
making
of
the
law
or
the
executing
of
the
law...
but
the
principal
concern
was
that
for
the
federal
courts
to
be
effective,
to
be
seen
as
neutral
arbiters
of
our
law
and
our
facts,
that
members
of
the
federal
judiciary
have
to
stay
out
of
the
political
fray.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
making
policy.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
openly.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that's
right,
except
in
the
context
of
a
case
of
controversy
where
there
inevitably
will
be
some
policy
to
be
made.
it's
when--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
and
it
is
done
in
the
context
of
a
case
or
controversy.
nobody
suggests--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--well,
two
things
about
the
judicial
councils.
one
is
the
areas
in
which
they
have
power
to
act
are
by
and
large
procedural,
or
they
relate
to
matters
such
as
discipline,
which
this
court's
decision
in
chandler
and
others
recognized
are
ancillary
to
the
principle
function
of
judges
deciding
cases
or
controversies.
the
judicial
conference
could
be
said
to
be
making
policy,
but
it
principally
affects
the
workings
of
the
court.
these
sentencing
guidelines
are
intended
to
affect
primary
conduct.
the
purpose
of
the
sentencing
guidelines,
as
congress
said,
is
not
to
rehabilitate
defendants,
but
to
deter
them,
to
punish
them.
the
message
is
to
go
out
loud
and
clear.
members
of
the
public,
if
you
commit
crimes,
look
at
the
sentencing
guidelines
and
you
will
go
to
jail.
no
more
hoping
for
a
judge
to
let
you
off.
that's
the
judgement
congress
made,
and
that
is
a
very
different
kind
of
judgement
than
that
kind
made
by
judicial
bodies,
which
are
largely
advisory
or
operating
in
the
context
of
a
case
or
controversy.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that
is
correct.
as
to
the
ultimate
effect,
it
did.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it
did.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
let
me
say,
that
took
place
before.
there
were
sentencing
groups,
councils,
i
don't
know
the
precise
appellation...
they
may
have
varied
from
court
to
court...
but
they
were
not
mandatory,
and
that
no
right
of
appeal
by
any
defendant
or
by
the
government
pertained
in
the
event
a
judge
diverted
from
that.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
mandatory
nature
makes
this
into
a
law-making
function
that
is
going
on
here.
but
as
i
said,
to
me
it
matters
not
that
there
is
an
attempt
here
to
say
that
judges
are
after
all
not
sitting
as
courts
of
law,
they're
acting
in
their
individual
capacities
when
they
are
deciding
these
rules...
that
the
judges
are
commissioners
and
the
fact
that
they
are
judges
is
simply...
can
be
disregarded.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes?
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
if
my
client
had
been
sentenced
under
the
guidelines,
there
would
have
been
no
constitutional
objection
to
the
sentence
imposed
on
him,
because
once
congress
goes
to
the
constitutionally
mandated
form
for
enacting
legislation,
i
do
not
believe
that
my
client
could
go
behind
it.
i
would
still
say
that
there
has
been
a
transgression
of
the
principles
of
separation
of
powers
by
the
article
iii
judges
participating
in
this
system,
although
it
would
be
of
a
somewhat
different
nature.
but
nobody
would
have
any
standing,
i
don't
think
to--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--i
assume
no
one
could
challenge
it,
but
i
would
believe
it
would
be
un-constitutional.
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
what
the
founding
fathers
believed
should
be
the
properly
limited
function
of
article
iii
judges.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
your
honor,
i
did
not
say
that,
and
i'm
glad
you
asked
me
that,
because
i
want
to
clarify
my
views
on
that.
if
a
judge,
not
acting
pursuant
to
a
statutory
mandate,
as
we
have
here,
and
not
being
directed
to
produce
a
consensus
determination,
not
only
with
article
iii
judges,
but
with
four
people
who
are
not
article
iii
judges,
wants
to
proceed
on
his
own
individual
basis,
and
to
testify
before
congress
about
a
matter
relating
to
judicial
administration...
it
seems
to
me
that
under
the
balancing
test
that
this
court
has
established
in
cases
such
as
nixon
v.
gsa
and
morrison
v.
olson,
that
that
would
not
be
a
transgression
upon
the
powers
of
the
judiciary
or
upon
any
other
powers.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
your
honor,
i
would
not
say
"surely".
i
think
that's
a
closer
question.
i
do
not
think
that
judges
should...
if
they
tend--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
article
iii
of
the
constitution,
as
most
recently
interpreted
by
this
court
in
morrison...
particularly
the
part
in
which
the
court
said
that
even
the
attempt
to
close
down
the
office
of
the
independent
counsel
might
be
administrative
acts
of
the
kind
inappropriate
for
a
judge.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
your
honor,
i
submit
that
if
congress
had
said
that
the
function
shall
be
performed
by
an
independent
appointing
commission,
or
that
if
in
this
case
the
court
said
the
congress
described
this
body
as
a
sentencing
court,
the
outcome
would
have
been
the
same.
we
have,
in
our
system...
courts
do
not
decide
cases,
controversies.
judges
decide
cases
or
controversies,
and
judges
are
lifetime
appointees--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--no,
i
think
it's
quite
a
question
of
reality,
your
honor,
that
a
judge
cannot
remove
his--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--no,
i
have
an
answer,
i'm
just
waiting
for
the
applause
to
die
down.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
would
say
a
judge
should
not
testify
in
opposition.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it
is
a
political
act.
we
are...
what
we
are
having
in
this
situation
is
that
in
order
to
maintain
our
judiciary
in
the
way
that
i
believe
the
founding
fathers
envisioned,
judges
are
supposed
to
stay
out
of
political
controversies.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
but
it
would
be
improper
for
them
to
campaign
on
behalf
of
a
person
for
a
political
office.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
and
the
difference
is
because
it
is
visible
on
the
one
hand
and
not
visible
on
the
other.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
i
do
not
believe
that.
i
did
not
intend
to
say
that,
because
if
you're
talking--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--i
think
the
judges
are
providing
expert
explanation
of
what
they
did.
perhaps
some
of
it
will
turn
into
advice.
but
one
of
the
things
we
have
here
is
not
simply
an
individual
judge
acting
on
his
or
her
own.
we
don't
simply
have
a
collective
group
of
judges
coming
in
and
making
a
recommendation.
we
have
a
collective
group
of
judges
joining
with
four
non-judges,
attempting
to
reach
a
political
consensus,
and
that
consensus
then
becomes
the
law
of
sentencing.
and
inherent
in
reaching
that
sentence
is
not
merely
expert
advice,
but
very
value-laden
judgments.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
in
this
commission
process.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
believe
that
judges
shouldn't
do
it.
as
i
said,
the
sentence
imposed--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--yes,
i
would
have
to
say
that.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
we
certainly
do
not,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--correct.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
we
do
not
have
to
reach
that
problem,
your
honor,
but
i
was
asked
the
question
and
i
do
have
to
answer,
i
believe.
[laughter]
the
effort
to
treat
the
judges
here
as
acting
in
their
individual
capacity
falters
both
on
the
facts
of
this
statute...
that
is,
that
congress
insisted
that
three
article
iii
judges
be
on
board.
they
insisted
that
they
sit
down
and
meet
with
four
other
non-article
iii
judges,
and
that
they
engage
in
a
process
that
could
fairly
be
called
horsetrading,
to
come
up
with
a
ranking
of
offenses
and
appropriate
levels
of
offenses
involving
some
of
the
most
political
judgments
that
we
have
to
make.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
doesn't
matter
whether
this
function
was
assigned
to
a
court...
if
it
had
been
assigned
to
this
court,
without
the
non-judicial
members,
surely
the
outcome
of
the
case
would
not
have
been
any
different.
if
your
honors
had
descended
from
the
bench,
taken
off
your
robes,
gone
into
a
conference
room
instead
of
a
courtroom,
and
decided
the
case
in
your
individual
capacities,
decided
in
your
individual
capacities
to
issue
these
sentencing
guidelines.
surely
the
outcome
can't
be
depended
upon
whether
you're
wearing
robes,
whether
you're
called
"commissioner"
or
"your
honor".
the
constitution
deals
with
the
reality
that
federal
judges
who
are
appointed
for
life
must
maintain
their
neutrality
and
their
impartiality
and
because
this
sentencing
commission
system
fundamentally
alters
that
balance,
it
is
un-constitutional.
thank
you,
your
honors.
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
thank
you,
your
honor.
let
me
turn
first
to
the
point
that
mr.
bator
made
regarding
the
question
of
whether
these
kinds
of
parole
and
probation
functions
could
be
taken
care
if
in
the
judicial
branch,
although
they're
now
in
the
executive
branch.
i
thought
that
our
reply
brief
was
clear,
but
if
it's
not,
i'll
make
it
clear
now.
we
weren't
talking
about
what
judges
could
do,
but
i
don't
think
it
would
matter.
i
think
the
important
points
is
that
in
those
particular
circumstances,
they
would
be
acting
as
individual
adjudicators,
much
as
the
parole
commission
now
adjudicates
when
a
person,
or
determines
when
a
person
is
entitled
to
parole.
we
said
nothing
about
judges
laying
down
rules
to
apply
to
probation
any
more
than
judges
now
do.
second,
i
want
to
be
clear
that
although
bator
says
that
you
have
to
show
actual
prejudice
to
find
a
violation
of
separation
of
powers,
last
year
in
this
court's
decision
in
morrison
v.
olson,
when
discussion
the
question
of
whether
the
independent
counsel,
the
judges
could
close
down
the
office
of
the
independent
counsel
in
the
event
the
work
of
the
independent
counsel
was
done,
the
court
did
not
look
to
find
actual
prejudice.
it
said
that
"we
will
construe
the
statute
narrowly,
lest
it
be
considered
that
the
special
court
could
engage
in
administrative-type
activity."
no
showing
of
actual
prejudice
to
any
branch
of
the
government...
a
prophylactic
rule
of
the
kind
that
we're
asking
for
here.
it
is,
i
suggest,
the
fact
that
if
this
commission
is
allowed
to
do
this
that
we
will
have
commissions
on
punitive
damages
dealing
with
remedies,
on
pain
and
suffering
dealing
with
remedies,
on
statues
of
limitations
dealing
with
remedies,
at
least
in
federal
causes.
indeed,
we
could
have
the
commission
re-write
the
bankruptcy
code,
for
what
is
the
bankruptcy
law
after
all
but
a
series
of
remedies
for
pre-existing
rights?
and
if
you
do
not
believe,
as
i
do,
that
that's
sufficiently
incongruous
for
article
iii
judges
to
be
performing
on
their
own,
it
certainly
seems
to
me
that
given
our
separation
of
powers
to
add
four
non-judges
to
a
commission
and
to
have
them
make
the
policy
choices
offends
our
basic
notions
of
separation
of
powers,
and
for
those
reasons,
the
commission
cannot
stand.
let
me
say
one
final
word
about
the
solicitor-general's
notion
of
need
for
evolution.
if
the
congress
had
taken
the
advice
of
many
and
passed
this
statute,
these
guidelines
into
law,
we
would
have
a
very
different
set
of
circumstances,
for
the
basic
policy
choices
would
have
been
made,
albeit
with
much
advice,
by
the
congress
when
it
enacted
it
into
the
law.
we
would
then
have
intelligible
principles
against
which
we
could
determine
whether,
in
the
light
of
experience,
the
guidelines
were
working.
we
would
have
a
very
different
situation,
so
it
would
be
a
one-shot
act
by
congress,
followed
by
a
commission
which
thereafter
properly
constituted
could
effectively
carry
out
the
law
and
not
leave
in
place
forever.
thank
you
very
much.
