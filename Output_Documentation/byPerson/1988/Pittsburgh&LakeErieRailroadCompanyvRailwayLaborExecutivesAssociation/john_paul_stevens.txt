mr.
wyatt,
do
i
understand
your
position
to
be
that
you...
given
the
fact,
that
under
your
view
the
icc
has
such
extensive
power
and
has
historically
imposed
labor
conditions
and
all
the
rest,
did
you
have
no
duty
to
bargain
over
the
protective
provisions
that
the
rlea
asked
for?
justice
john
paul
stevens
through
the
icc.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--this
is
one
of
the
problems,
at
least
for
me,
that
historically,
before
the
recent
amendments
to
the
commerce
act,
wherever
there
were
protective
provisions
they
were
the
result
of
an
icc
order.
were
they
not?
they
didn't
typically
bargain
about
this.
or,
am
i
wrong
as
a
matter
of
history?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
it
was
not,
at
least
historically,
a
matter
of
collective
bargaining.
and
then
when
the
icc
changes
its
practice
and
says
no
more
protective
provisions,
it's
sort
of
totally
changing
the
conditions
under
which
bargaining
might
have
taken
place
in
the
past.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
they
had
done
so,
and
if
there
were
protective
provisions
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
could
the
icc
supersede
those
and
say
we
are
going
to
approve
this
on
the
condition
that
there
would
be
no...
could
it
alter
the
protective
provisions
that
might
have
been
agreed
upon
between
the
parties?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
clarke,
in
those
examples
you
described
in
the
'50s
and
'60s
did
the
negotiations
generally
precede
the
submission
to
the
icc
for
approval
so
that
the
icc
would
then
put
into
effect
the
conditions
the
parties
already
agreed
upon?
is
that
how
it
worked?
justice
john
paul
stevens
judicial
review
under
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard?
