justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
wyatt,
the
solicitor
general,
of
course,
takes
a
view
somewhat
different
from
yours
and
says
it's
true
that
we
should
not
interpret
the
acts
here
to
preclude
the
railroad
from
going
out
of
business
but
that
the
rla
can
be
reconciled
with
the
statues
governing
the
icc
by
requiring
some
limited
effects
bargaining.
are
you
going
to
address
yourself
to
that
argument?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
icc,
in
your
view,
clearly
have
power
to
cover
all
the
effects,
if
you
will,
of
the
termination?
severance
pay
and
so
forth?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
wyatt,
i
guess
it
is
conceivable
that
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
might
have
contained
some
provisions
dealing
with
the
effects
of
going
out
of
business.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
it
is
theoretically
possible
that
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
could
cover
some
aspects
of
the
effects
of
going
out
of
business.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
this
case
is
not
part
of
the
record
i
understand.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
no
matter
whether
we
agree
with
you
or
not,
it
has
to
go
back
below
to
determine
whether
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
has
something
to
say
about
this?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
the
notice
that
was
served
by
the
unions
in
this
case
was
proper
in
all
respects
and
just
covered
effects
bargaining
as
you
see
it,
or
did
it
go
beyond
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
the
icc
had
imposed
specific
requirements
in
connection
with
the
transaction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
would
your
position
be
then?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
comes
close
to
that
if
the
icc
thinks
about
whether
they
should
impose
conditions
and
determines
that
in
this
case
they
shouldn't.
then
you
think.
in
those
circumstances,
the
rla
trumps.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
going
out
of
business
necessarily
involves
changing
of
rates
of
pay
and
rules
and
working
conditions?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
though
the
railroad
agrees
to
until
it
makes
the
sale
maintain
the
status
quo?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--take
the
result
of
that
issue...
take
the
position
that
the
union
can
in
effect
require
bargaining
over
the
decision
to
go
out
of
business
or
sale?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
the
icc
enters
specific
orders
covering
what's
going
to
happen
to
the
labor--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
suppose--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--they
issue
such
orders,
covering
exactly
the
things
the
union
claims
it
wants
to
bargain
about--
