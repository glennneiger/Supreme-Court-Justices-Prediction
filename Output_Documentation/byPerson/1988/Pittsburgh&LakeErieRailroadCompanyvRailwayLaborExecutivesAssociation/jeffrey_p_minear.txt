mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
p&le
and
its
unions
are
in
sharp
disagreement
about
virtually
every
aspect
of
this
dispute.
and
perhaps
for
that
reason
this
case
seems
somewhat
more
complicated
than
it
needs
to
be.
the
united
states
submits
that
neither
party
is
completely
correct
and
that
this
case
turns
on
three
critical
questions.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
perhaps,
your
honor.
the
questions
we
think
that
are
at
the
bottom
of
this
dispute,
however,
are,
first,
does
the
rla
control
the
bargaining
rights
and
obligations
of
these
parties.
and
we
submit
the
answer
to
that
is
yes.
second,
does
that
statute
require
p&le
to
bargain
with
its
employees
upon
request
about
the
effects
of
its
decision
to
go
out
of
business?
here
too,
the
answer
is
yes.
and,
third,
does
p&le's
obligation
under
the
rla
to
maintain
rates
of
pay,
rules,
and
working
conditions
during
the
bargaining
process
automatically
require
the
railroad
to
preserve
its
employee's
jobs
until
bargaining
is
completed?
we
submit
that
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
problem
here,
your
honor,
is--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
believe
it
does
have
a
position,
but
it's
complicated--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--when
this
case
arrived
at
the
district
court,
there
was
a
request
for
a
status
quo
injunction,
but
it
wasn't
clear
what
exactly
the
status
quo
was.
we
believe
that
the
rla...
or,
the
unions
in
this
case,
could
legitimately
ask
that
the
rates
of
pay,
rules
and
working
conditions
shall
not
be
altered
by
the
carrier
during
the
effects
of
bargaining
process.
however,
i
think
the
unions
sought
something
broader
than
that.
they
wished
the
absolute
preservation
of
their
jobs.
we
believe
the
district
court
erred
in
requiring
absolute
preservation
of
its
jobs
but
could
have
entered
an
injunction
to
preserve
the
status
quo
which
would
include
any
terms
or
conditions
the
employment.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
only
in
one
circumstance,
your
honor.
and
that
is
if
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
themselves
clearly
prohibited
the
sale
from
going
forward.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
think
not.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
at
least
to
that
extent
it
should
be
reversed.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
that's
right,
your
honor.
but
i
think
there's
two
factors
to
bear
in
mind
with
respect
to
that.
first
of
all,
there
is,
as
p&le
pointed
out,
a
lag
period
between
the
time
of
announcement
of
the
closure
and
the
actual
closure.
and,
secondly,
the
fact
that
the
unions
are
disadvantaged
by
this
simply
reflects
the
fact...
the
rather
late
in
the
day
come
to
seek
to
change
their
agreements
to
reflect
additional
job
security.
all
of
these
things
are
matters
that
could
have
been
negotiated
months
or
even
years
ago.
and
so,
in
fact,
although
the
unions
might
have
little
bargaining
power
here,
it
simply
reflects
the
fact
they've
not
raised
these
issues
before.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
correct,
your
honor.
as
i
said,
there
are
three
questions
here.
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
first
of
those
at
this
point.
we
think
it
is
apparent
that
the
rla,
rather
than
the
interstate
commerce
act
determines
the
bargaining
rights
and
obligations
of
these
parties.
since
1926
the
rla
has
been
the
basic
source
for
defining
the
bargaining
obligations
of
railway
management
and
labor.
section
2
of
that
statute
provides
that
both
labor
and
management
must
exert
every
reasonable
effort
to
make
and
maintain
agreements
with
respect
to
rates
of
pay,
rules
and
working
conditions.
section
2
further
provides
that
no
carrier
shall
change
the
rates
of
pay
rules
or
working
conditions
as
embodied
in
the
agreements
except
in
the
manner
prescribed
in
section
6--
section
6,
which
controls
the
resolution
of
these
so-called
major
disputes,
requires
that
a
party
seeking
to
change
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
must
give
30
days
notice
of
the
intended
change,
and
further
provides
that
rates
of
pay,
rules
and
working
conditions
shall
not
be
altered
during
the
bargaining
process.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
that's
a
difficulty
here
that
i
don't
think
the
united
states
is
in
the
best
position
to
address.
what
the
section
6
notice
has
included
in
this
case
was
a
request
for
perpetual
employment
in
that
sense.
this--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--we
believe
that
this
could
well
constitute
bargaining
over
the
decision
itself
rather
than
simply
effects
decisionmaking.
in
a
case
where
the
railroad
were
a
term
that
sought
to
be
bargained...
would
in
effect
prevent
the
transaction
from
going
forward,
it
may
extend
beyond
effects
bargaining.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor,
i
think
there's
a
couple
of
points
i'd
like
to
say
in
response
to
that.
first,
we're
talking
about
a
particular
type
of
transaction
here.
a
section
10901
transaction.
now,
there
are
other
types
of
transactions
covered
by
the
ica
where
the
result
could
conceivably
be
different.
but
in
this
we're
only
looking
at
a
10901
transaction.
secondly,
this
is
a
case
where
the
transaction
itself
has
been
exempted
from
ica
regulation.
what
section
10505
of
the
ica
gives
the
icc
is
the
power
to
exempt
a
transaction
from
its
scrutiny
on
the
basis
that
there
is
no
need
for
the
application
of
a
particular
provision
of
the
ica.
now,
if
they've
made
that
determination,
then
it
seems
somewhat
difficult
for
us
to
argue
that
the
ica
would
in
fact
supersede
another
statute
on
the
books.
so--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
is
a
more
difficult
question.
i
would
point
out
that
question
is
not
here,
but
there's
certain
matters
that
the
court
may
consider.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i'm
not
sure
i'm
authorized
to
take
a
position
for
the
solicitor
general
on
that
particular
point.
but
i
would
point
out
that
first
of
all
there
is
no
express
textual
basis
for--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--your
honor,
i
think
certainly
there's
a
strong
basis
for
that
inference,
based
primarily
on
the
fact
that
section
10901
doesn't
have
any
express
preemptive
language.
you
can
compare
that
to
section
11341
which
does
have
an
express
preemptive
provision
in
the
case
of
mergers
and
consolidations.
in
those
cases,
given
the
difference
between
those
two
statutes,
that
might
well
reflect
a
congressional
intent
to
treat
these
two
types
of
transactions
differently.
again,
since
this
is
an
accepted...
exempted
transaction,
we
think
that
the
case
is
somewhat
easier
here.
in
this
case,
the
railroad
announced
its
decision
to
go
out
of
business
and
its
unions
sought
to
modify
their
labor
contracts
to
soften
the
blow.
they
invoked
the
rla's
collective
bargaining
mechanism
for
that
purpose.
we
believe
that
the
unions
could
properly
invoke
the
rla
bargaining
rights
in
these
circumstances
and
that
the
railroad
could
not
enjoin
them
from
doing
so.
but
that
does
not
mean
that
rla
had
a
duty
to
bargain
about
any
and
all
aspects
of
the
transaction.
as
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
recognized
and
the
unions
apparently
conceded
below,
the
unions
have
no
right
to
bargain
about
the
actual
decision
to
go
out
of
business.
the
rla,
which
specifies
and
specifically
identifies
the
subjects
of
bargaining,
does
not
require
the
railroad
to
bargain
about
business
decisions
which
have
always
been
treated
as
matters
of
managerial
prerogative.
but
bargaining
about
the
effects
of
the
business
decision
is
a
different
matter.
the
rla,
by
its
terms,
requires
the
railroad
to
bargain
about
rates
of
pay,
rules
and
working
conditions,
and
nothing
in
the
rla
prohibits
the
union
from
proposing
changes
with
respect
to
those
matters
in
response
to
a
railroad's
business
decision.
two
points,
however,
deserve
special
emphasis
here.
and
i
think
i've
touched
on
them
both
already.
first,
the
rla's
limitation
on
subjects
of
bargaining
reflects
congress'
judgment
that
management
must
be
free
from
the
constraints
of
the
bargaining
process
to
the
extent
necessary
to
exercise
business
judgment.
but
it
follows
that
a
union
is
not
entitled
to
engage
in
effects
of
bargaining
for
the
improper
purpose
of
thwarting
an
employer's
exercise
of
that
judgment.
and,
second,
the
carrier's
duty
to
bargain--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
think
not,
your
honor,
although
that
is
a
tougher
case.
typically
effects
bargaining
extends
to
questions
of
severance
pay,
job
security,
and
the
like.
now,
obviously
your
question
contemplates
the
possibility
of
a
term
of
proposal
that
would
in
fact
provide
that
protection
as
a
part
of
the
transaction.
although
i
think
that's
a
closer
question,
i
still
think
that
would
fall
within
the
traditional
business
judgment
of
the
railroad
and
it
would
not
be
a
rate
of
pay
rule
or
working
condition
as
that
term
is
used
in
the
rla.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
this
is
a
mandatory
subject
of
bargaining.
and
if
it's
not
a
mandatory
subject
of
bargaining,
then,
of
course,
the
railroad
can
go
forward
and
take
the
action.
i
admit
that
that
is
a
closer
question,
but
the
government
would
believe
that
that
would
not
be
a
mandatory
subject
of
bargaining.
this
brings
us
to
the
most
important
issue
in
this
case,
and
that
is
p&le's
status
quo
obligations.
the
court
of
appeals
broadly
held
that
if
a
union
serves
a
section
6
notice
that
proposes
changes
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
section
6
prohibits
the
railroad
from
taking
actions
adverse
to
labor
even
though
such
actions
would
be
permissible
or
authorized
under
the
existing
employer/employee
relationship.
we
believe
that
that
is
incorrect.
the
rla
is
concerned,
as
i
said
before,
with
the
formation
and
maintenance
of
agreements
concerning
rates
of
pay,
rules
and
working
conditions.
and
section
6,
which
sets
forth
the
process
for
the
change
in
such
agreements,
provides
the
railroad
must
continue
to
honor
its
existing
obligations
with
respect
to
those
subjects
during
the
bargaining
process.
but
it
does
not
prevent
the
railroad
from
taking
actions
that
are
authorized
under
existing
collective
agreements
or
through
the
understanding
of
the
parties,
as
reflected
in
established
work
practices.
indeed,
if
a
railroad
were
precluded
from
taking
such
actions,
then
many
existing
agreements
and
implicit
understandings
would
be
meaningless.
for
example,
a
union
could
always
thwart
a
railroad's
exercise
of
a
contractual
right
to
take
future
action
by
simply
filing
a
section
6
notice
before
the
action
is
taking
and
invoking
section
6
status
quo
requirement.
plainly,
the
rla
was
not
intended
to
produce
that
result.
instead,
existing
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
are
part
of
the
status
quo.
we
believe
that
this
is
the
only
position
that
is
consistent
with
section
6's
language
and
the
legislative
history.
we
believe
that
this
position
is
also
consistent
with
this
court's
decision
in
shoreline.
the
question
there
was
whether
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
were
the
sole
source
for
determining
working
conditions.
the
court
held
that
one
must
look
as
well
to
implicit
understandings,
as
expressed
in
the
actual
on-the-job
practices.
the
court
did
not
hold
that
the
railroad
must
preserve
jobs
apart
from
the
express
or
implicit
understandings
that
define
and
condition
the
employment
relationship.
it
viewed
those
as
a
part
of
the
status
quo.
our
interpretation,
in
addition
to
being
consistent
with
the
rla's
language
and
legislative
history
and
this
court's
precedence,
also
furthers
the
rla's
fundamental
policy
of
encouraging
the
formation
of
agreements
that
specify
in
advance
the
rights
of
management
and
labor
in
the
face
of
future
contingencies.
furthermore,
it
avoids
the
possibility
of
an
erosive
taking
of
an
insolvent
railroad
who
would
be
forced
to
continue
its
operations
against
its
will.
in
this
case,
as
p&le
indicated,
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
are
not
before
the
court,
and
the
parties
have
not
established
the
past
practices
with
respect
to
reductions
in
work
force.
if
p&le's
unions
have
already
negotiated
applicable
job
security
arrangements
or
certain
severance
benefits
are
an
established
work
practice
in
these
circumstances,
then
the
unions
are
permitted
the
continuation
of
those
arrangements
or
benefits
during
the
bargaining
process.
but
if,
on
the
other
hand,
the
agreements
and
practices
authorize
work
force
reductions
without
such
protections,
then
that
is
the
status
quo.
and
if
the
parties
have
differing
interpretations
of
the
agreements
and
past
practices,
then
their
disagreement
is
subject
to
resolution
under
the
rla's
so-called
minor
dispute
provisions
which
call
for
binding
arbitration
of
such
questions.
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
binding
arbitration
can
even
go
to
the
question
of
whether
there
is
or
is
not
a
major
or
minor
dispute.
this
is
something
that
is
indicated
in
section
3
second.
so,
in
fact,
the
adjustment
board
can
provide
complete
relief
in
these
circumstances
and
also
can
make
some
of
these
determinations
that
advance
to
the
courts.
at
this
point
the...
our
brief,
of
course,
was
filed
before
the
unions
filed
theirs.
and
we,
of
course,
left
open
the
question
that
there
was
a
dispute
over
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
p&le
now
suggests
that
perhaps
they
agree
on
what
the
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
are.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
right.
what
the
unions
seem
to
be
arguing
is
that
there
is
a
change
in
the
nature
of
the
agreements.
i'm
not
sure
what
that
term
means.
perhaps
that's
another
way
of
saying
that
there
is
a
violation
of
the
agreement.
but
if
there
is
no
violation
of
the
agreement,
it's
hard
to
see
how
there
would
be
either
a
major
or
a
minor
dispute
in
these
circumstances.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
their
labor
protective
provisions
are
defined
in
section
11347
which
have
a
long
history
and
they
incorporate
some
of
the
notions
and
past
understandings
in
the
railroad
business.
one
of
the
things
that
11347
says
is
that
it
looks
to
a
separate
section,
the
rail
passenger
act,
to
define
in
part
what
the
collective
provisions
are.
that
statute
in
turn
says
that
collective
bargaining
rights
are
preserved.
it
doesn't
say
"agreements"
as
i
recall,
but
it
talks
about
rights.
so
i
think
there
is
some
ambiguity
of
whether
the
icc
would
believe
that
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
themselves
are
preserved
or
only
the
collective
bargaining
in--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
is
correct.
they
can
do
so
in
this
transaction.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
that
is
right.
the
icc
does
have
the
power
to
impose
collective
bargaining...
or,
to
impose
labor
protective
provisions.
that
was
something
this
court
said
in
its
lowden
decision,
and
it's
something
that's
covered
in
section
10901
transactions.
the
icc's
authority,
however,
is
discretionary.
it's
a
matter
of--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
i--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
i'd
be
happy
to
answer--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
indicated
before
i
think
that's
an
unsettled
question,
and
that's
a
question
where
i
can
give
you
the
views
of
myself
standing
at
the
podium
here,
although
i
don't
believe
the
solicitor
general
has
taken
a
position
on
that--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--specific
matter.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
in
this
particular
case,
as
i
pointed
out
before,
the
court
doesn't
need
to
reach
that
particular
issue
because
it's
an
exempted
transaction.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but
that
can
also--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--their
exemption
can
also
reflect
the
view
that
there
is
no
need
for
them
to
impose
labor
protective
provisions.
it's
something
that
can
be
left
to
the
rla.
our
concern
here
is
that
there
is--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but,
your
honor,
the
decision
whether
or
not
to
provide
labor
protection
under
the
ica
goes
primarily
to
whether
or
not
this
is
providing
fair
wages
for
employees
and
safe
working
conditions.
the
icc
might
conclude,
on
the
on
hand,
that
the
provision
of
the
protective
conditions
is
not
necessary
in
this
case
because
there
is
an
alternative
mechanism.
i
suggest
that
they
probably
did
not
have
that
view
here.
in
fact,
felt
that
it
was
in
the
public
interest
not
to
provide
such
a
protection.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--probably
the
best
source
for
that
would
be
the
icc's
exemption
provision
itself,
the
ex
parte
392
provision.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but,
again,
the
difficulty
here
is
that
section
10901
does
not
have
any
affirmative
textual
basis
for
superseding
otherwise
applicable
law.
and
that's
what
gives
us
some
pause
in
this
situation.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
that
that
is
generally
true,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
but
that
certainly
would
be
appropriate
at
that
point
for
the
labor
unions
to
approach
their
employers
and
to
indicate
that
they
would
like
to
bargain
for
protective
conditions
that
the
icc
is
no
longer
providing.
that
would
be
a
legitimate
section
6
request
that
could
be
forwarded
to
any
of--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
think
that
raises
a
fairly
serious
question
of
the
icc's
authority,
whether
it
would
have
the
authority
to
in
fact
preempt
existing
contracts.
the
places
where
the
icc
is
given
the
authority
to
supersede
loss
usually
uses
the
term
law.
it
indicates,
for
instance
in
section
11341,
that
a
transaction
approved
by
the
icc
is
exempt
from
any
other
laws
necessary
to
carry
forward
the
transaction.
i'm
not
aware
of
anything
in
the
ica
that
gives
the
icc
the
power
to
in
fact
undo
contractual
provisions
that
might
already
be
present.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
well,
it's
imposing
additional
obligations
by
law.
it's
not
undoing
an
obligation
that
it
already
has
by
contract.
and
i
think
there's
a
distinction
there.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
it
doesn't.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
in
terms
of
supersession,
it
usually
requires
an
affirmative
showing
of
an
intent
to
supersede
another
statute.
that
has
been
the
rule
this
court
has
adopted
and
the
rule
that
presumably
congress
acts
upon
when
it
passes
legislation.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
question
is
whether
or
not
they
can
reconciled,
whether
or
not
they
can
both
be
applied
in
a
coherent
way.
and,
again,
here
we
have
a
case
where
the
icc
has
exempted
the
party
from
the
relevant
provision
of
the
statute.
and
so,
again,
it's
difficult
to
see
how
there
is
a
direct
conflict
between
those
two
statutes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
if
both
statutes
impose
conditions
upon
the
employer,
then
i
suppose
that
would
be
the
logical
result
of
choosing
one
or
the
other,
is
that
one
of
the
two
would
apply.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it's
11341.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
