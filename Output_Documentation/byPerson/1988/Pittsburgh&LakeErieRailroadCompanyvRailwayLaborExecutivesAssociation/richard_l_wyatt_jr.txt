mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
seventeen
months
ago
the
pittsburgh
&
lake
erie
railroad
decided
to
go
out
of
the
railroad
business.
the
simple
undeniable
fact
in
this
case
is
that
after
years
of
losses
and
a
fruitless
search
for
a
buyer,
it
finally
found
a
buyer
willing
to
buy
its
assets.
deciding
to
exercise
its
fundamental
right
to
go
out
of
business,
it
entered
into
an
agreement
to
sell
certain
of
its
assets
to
railco.
now,
17
months
later,
much
against
its
will,
the
railroad
is
still
in
business
and
it's
still
losing
enormous
amounts
of
money,
over
one--
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
--million
dollars
each
month.
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
your
honor,
they
cannot
require
them
to
serve
indefinitely,
as
we
indicate
in
the
fifth
amendment
cases.
i
believe
the
brooks-scanlon
case
was
a
railroad
case
where
the
interstate
commerce
commission
tried
to
prolong
the
railroad
from
going
out
of
business.
there
is
a
point
at
which
a
losing
railroad
has
a
right,
even
as
against
the
icc,
to
go
completely
out
of
business.
but
mr.
justice
scalia
is
correct,
the
icc
does
have
the
authority
to
require
that
railroad
to
delay
its
exit
from
the
industry.
and
that
is
exclusively
the
icc's
authority.
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
well,
at
this
point
we
are
now
talking
about
a
17-month
delay
in
exit,
which
appears
to
stretch
on
endlessly.
we
are
now
talking
about
an
interminable
delay
and
we're
talking
about
a
specific
icc
order
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
scalia,
which
said
the
immediate
consummation
of
that
transaction
to
railco
was
in
the
public
interest
and
it
should
have
been
done
immediately.
instead,
what
we
have
in
this
case
now
are
two
companion
rulings
from
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
hold
that
the
company,
while
it
was
free
to
decide
to
go
out
of
business,
it
could
not
do
so
until
it
completed
the
bargaining
processes
of
the
act.
and
it
also
held
that
rlea's
strike,
launched,
as
the
district
court
said,
to
deliberately
frustrate
the
terms
of
the
icc-approved
sale,
and
for
that
purpose
alone,
that
that
strike
could
not
be
enjoined
as
a
violation
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
but,
really,
we
believe
three
issues
critical
to
the
resolution
of
the
issues
this
court
granted
certiorari
on.
those
three
issues
are,
first,
the
interstate
commerce
act,
the
nature
and
scope
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
exclusive
and
plenary
jurisdiction
in
these
transactions.
the
second
is
the
nature
and
scope
of
the
railway
labor
act's
bargaining
command,
and
it's
command...
and
its
prohibition
on
unilateral
action.
do
those
bargaining
commands
and
do
those
prohibitions
apply
to
icc-regulated
transactions?
we
think
there's
a
third
critical
issue.
depending
on
the
resolution
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
issue
and
the
railway
labor
act
issue,
it
may
not
be
necessary
to
reach
it.
but
the
third
issue
would
be
the
accommodation
issue.
and
that
is
if
these
two
conflicting
laws
do...
if
these
two
laws
do
apply
in
a
way
where
there
is
a
conflict,
what
is
the
appropriate
accommodation
of
the
two
laws.
turning
first
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
issue,
we
think
it's
clear,
and
it's
always
been
clear,
that
in
the
case
of
fundamental
corporate
transactions
involving
rail
carriers
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
exclusive
and
plenary
jurisdiction
to
approve
or
disapprove
those
transactions.
for
instance,
the
exit
of
the
pittsburgh
&
lake
erie
railroad
from
the
industry.
that
was
governed
under
section
10901
or
10903
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
the
purchase
of
assets
by
railco,
or
the
potential
purchase
of
assets,
that
was
governed
under
section
10901
in
this
case.
exit,
entrance,
sale
of
assets,
in
most
cases
are
subject
to
the
extensive
regulatory
framework
of
the
icc,
and
that's
because
congress
has
repeatedly
recognized
that
railroads
are
infused
with
the
public
interest.
and
it's
given
the
icc
a
broad
mandate
to
regulate
railroads.
it
regulates
the
railroad
system
of
this
country
in
the
public
interest
and
under
a
standard
of
public
convenience
and
necessity.
this
transaction
was
regulated,
as
i've
indicated,
under
section
10901
in
the
icc's
order
in
ex
parte
392.
but
more
than
just
regulating
corporate
transactions
or
the
sale
of
assets,
entrance
and
exit
of
new
companies,
the
icc
has
very
large
discretionary
jurisdiction
over
labor
interests.
the
interests
of
the
railway
labor
executives'
association
in
this
case.
their
interest
comes
from
section
10101(a),
subsection
12,
where
they're
charged
by
congress
with
providing
fair
wages
and
suitable
working
conditions
for
the
employees
in
the
nation's
rail
industry.
and
their
interests
and
their
discretion
comes
from
further
than
that.
their
discretion
also
goes
back
as
far
as
the
case
of
united
states
v.
lowden,
this
court's
decision
in
a
discretionary
transaction,
this
court
holding
that
the
icc
had
the
discretionary
authority
to
protect
the
interests
of
labor
in
the
transaction
to
further
labor
peace
and
to
improve
the
morale
of
the
employees
of
the
nation's
railroads.
for
50
years
beginning
before
the
lowden
case
and
continuing
after
the
lowden
case,
rail
labor
has
regularly
gone
to
the
icc
and
they've
regularly
gone
to
congress
and
they've
implored
both,
and
usually
been
successful,
to
impose
labor
protective
conditions
in
icc-regulated
transactions.
in
this
particular
case,
this
transaction
was
governed
under
the
icc's
order
in
ex
parte
392.
rail
labor
participated
fully
and
completely
in
the
formulation
of
the
policy
of
ex
parte
392.
they
participated
actively.
they
opposed
what
the
icc
did
in
ex
parte
392,
but
they
were
participants.
what
they
received
from
ex
parte
392
was
the
right
to
petition
the
icc
in
exceptional
cases
where
they
could
demonstrate
extraordinary
circumstances
in
under
10901
and
could
show
that
their
interests
were
truly
being
harmed
by
the
transaction.
in
this
particular
case,
the
pittsburgh
&
lake
erie
transaction,
rail
labor
never
went
to
the
icc
under
ex
parte
392
and
tried
to
invoke
its
discretionary
jurisdiction.
instead,
rail
labor
went
to
the
icc
and
they
went
and
said
to
the
icc,
you
should
stay
this
transaction.
why?
not
stay
it
to
look
at
the
impact
on
labor,
but
stay
it
to
give
us,
the
employees,
an
opportunity
to
make
a
competing
offer
for
this
railroad.
we
don't
like
the
purchaser.
we
don't
like
railco.
we
want
to
make
our
own
offer.
and
we
have
an
investment
advisor,
in
fact,
and
he's
going
to
offer
an
affidavit.
and
the
affidavit
of
the
investment
advisor
is
in
the
record.
but
from
the
very
outset
of
this
proceeding
rail
labor
was
insistent
that
they
had
a
right,
through
the
icc
process
originally,
to
make
an
offer
themselves
to
purchase
the
railroad.
so,
they
invoked
all
sorts
of
icc
jurisdiction
under
ex
parte
392.
but
the
primary
reason
for
the
invocation,
as
the
filings
indicate,
was
not
labor
protections,
to
protect
these
employees
from
the
effects
of
the
transaction.
but,
instead,
was
to
say,
"give
us
an
opportunity
to
buy
the
railroad.
"
the
icc
in
an
order
in
this
particular
case
denied
rail
labor's
motion
for
a
stay.
they
looked
at
the
situation
with
the
p&le,
understanding
the
economic
realities
of
a
sale
transaction,
the
fact
that
the
financing
wouldn't
last
forever
for
the
purchaser.
they
looked
at
the
entire
situation
and
said
the
p&le
is
very
weak,
the
p&le
is
very
sick.
they
are
also
essential
to
the
national
transportation
interests.
this
transaction
needs
to
be
consummated
immediately,
and
we
will
not
stay
it.
they
did
suggest
to
the
rlea
that
rlea
could
come
before
them
after
the
fact...
which
is
exactly
what
the
10505
exemption
procedure
requires...
and
orally
they
could
come
before
them
and
raise
all
claims.
they
could
even
raise
their
claim
to
have
the
transaction
reversed.
and
they
ordered
p&le
to
maintain
its
corporate
existence.
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i
was
going
to
address
that
now.
i
do
think,
though,
that
the
statutory
scheme
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
comes
into
play
in
evaluating
any
duty
to
bargain
over
effects
that
might
arise
in
a
transaction.
and
i
think
it's
important
for
the
court
to
realize
and
focus
on,
contrary
to
the
solicitor's
approach,
how
extensive
those
protections
are
and
how
powerful
the
icc
is
and
how
vigilant
it
has
been
to
protect
the
interests
of
rail
labor
employees
from
just
the
effects
of
these
corporate
transactions.
that
has
been
their
primary
role
with
respect
to
rail
labor
for
50
years.
and
congress
has
recognized
it.
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
justice
o'connor,
i
think
the
icc
has
far
more
power...
they
certainly
have
the
power
to
cover
severance
pay
and
traditional
effects.
they
even
have
the
power,
we
would
submit,
to
effectively
compel
us
to
look
at
rlea's
purchase
offer.
they
even
have
the
power
to
impose
the
successorship
obligation.
they
have
a
very
broad
conditioning
power
that
is
a
fundamental
power,
and
they
can
simply
impose
upon
us
whatever
conditions
as
a
condition
of
our
exit
from
the
industry.
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
that's
correct.
in
the
case
of
an
icc-approved
transaction,
justice
stevens,
once
that
transaction
process
goes
forward
or
is
initiated,
the
effects...
whatever
rlea
wants
by
way
of
effects,
it
has
to
present
that
petition
to
the
icc.
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
to
the
icc.
we
have
to
know...
in
this
case
p&le
intended
to
honor
its
labor
agreements
as
it
understood
them
to
exist.
there
is
no
question
that
we
were
intent
on
honoring
the
terms
of
the
labor
agreements.
but
we
have
to
know
with
some
certainty
when
we
enter
into
these
corporate
transactions,
when
we
go
to
a
buyer
and
say,
would
you
like
to
buy
us,
would
you
like
to
buy
our
assets...
we
have
to
be
able
to
tell
them
what
our
liabilities
are
at
that
point
in
time.
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
mr.
justice
scalla,
i
do
not
acknowledge
that.
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
that
fact
is
just
not
present
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
everyone
has
agreed
from
the
outset
in
this
case
that
there
is
no
violation
of
the
labor
agreements
as
they
exist.
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
i
think
the
icc...
think
the
icc
would
have
jurisdiction
and
would
have
discretion.
now,
how
the
reconciliation
of
a...
how
the
icc
would
reconcile
an
explicitly
guaranteed
contractual
right
and
what
they
view
to
be
the
needs
of
this
country
in
the
national
transportation
system,
i'm
not
sure.
they've
suggested...
and,
in
fact,
they've
said...
in
the
frvr
case--
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
--thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
this
court:
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
--yes,
that's
our
position.
our
position
is
that
the
decision
to
sell
itself
is
a
non-bargainable
subject,
it's
not
included
within
the
statutory
definition
of
rates,
pay,
rules
or
working
conditions.
and
we
rely
there,
mr.
chief
justice,
on
this
court's
reasoning
in
first
national
maintenance
where
this
court
faced
a
similar
claim
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
that
a
decision
to
partially
close
a
business
was
part
of
the
phrase
"terms
and
conditions"
of
employment.
a
much
broaded
phrase,
a
bargaining
command.
and
this
court
held,
after
a
lengthy
analysis
in
first
national
maintenance
that
indeed
the
decision
was
not
part
of
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
well,
the
court
of
appeals
appeared
to
agree
with
us.
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
--the
court
of
appeals
isolated
the
decision
from
any...
the
court
of
appeals
left
us
with
the
right
to
make
the
decision
in
the
boardroom
but
not
the
right
to
go
forward
with
the
decision.
we
think
what
first
national
maintenance
fairly
read
says
is
that
not
only
do
you
have
the
right
to
make
the
decision
and
the
decision
is
not
bargainable,
but
that
you
have
a
right
to
implement
the
decision
and
that
you
don't
have
to
exhaust
a
bargaining
duty
as
to
effects,
even
it
you
could
define...
if
you
define
what
the
effects
are,
that
that
duty
does
not
have
to
be
exhausted.
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
it's
exactly
correct.
i
read--
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
--well,
we...
of
course,
our
first
position
here
is
that
the
effects
were
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
this
case.
our
second
position
is
that
these
particular
effects
notices...
and
i
would
invite
the
court
to
focus
on
these
notices...
that
under
this
court's
authority
and
under
the
authority
of
the
lower
courts
these
notices
themselves,
we
had
no
duty
as
to
them
since
they
were
attempts
to
undo
the
transaction.
that
the
duty
to
bargain
as
to
the
effects
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
effect
over
which
bargaining
is
sought.
in
this
case,
what
rlea
wanted
was
this
carrier
to
agree
to
renegotiate
the
sale
transaction
with
railco
to
provide
for
a
successorship
agreement.
so
we
take
the
second
position
that
these
notices
themselves
were
non-bargainable
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
it
absolutely
meant
no
change
for
those
employees
as
long
as
they
were
in
our
employ.
we
were
honoring
all
contractually
agreed
upon
rates
of
pay,
rules,
and
working
conditions.
these
contracts,
as
they
existed
the
day
we
decided
to
go
out
of
business,
provided
no
guaranteed
level
of
employment.
they
provided
no
job
guarantees
at
all.
they
merely
provided
that
when
an
employee
came
to
work,
if
there
was
work...
when
an
employee
came
to
work,
these
were
the
rates
of
pay,
rules,
and
actual
agreements
that
covered
that
work.
so,
we
weren't
changing...
p&le
was
not
changing
any
term
of
the
agreement,
they
weren't
violating
any
term
of
the
agreement,
by
simply
going
out
of
business.
and
whatever
the
successor's
obligations
are
as
to
rlea
and
those
p&le
employees
the
successor
hired
are
governed,
we
believe,
under
this
court's
decisions
in
burns
detective
and
fall
river
dyeing.
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
i
believe
that
is--
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
--that
would
be
the
case
in
a
company
going
out
of
business.
once
we
effectuate
the
decision,
as
a
practical
matter,
p&le
has
no
operating
business.
but
that
is
not
to
say
in
this
particular
case
that
bargaining...
for
instance,
bargaining
could
not
have
been
meaningfully
conducted.
there
was
a
three-month
gap...
if
in
fact
this
court
found
in
effect
bargaining
obligation.
typically
between
the
time
a
decision
is
made,
a
sale
contract
entered,
there
is
a
period
of
time
before
the
transaction
closes,
during
which
bargaining
could
occur.
and
in
this
case,
p&le
would
have
continued
its
bargaining
obligation
after
the
sale
because
p&le
intended
to
operate,
albeit
not
as
a
railroad,
but
as
a
company
leasing
rail
cars
and
as
a
company
managing
real
estate
assets.
and
it
would
have
had
some
employees
covered
under
the
old
brack
agreement
in
this
case
who
would
have
worked
as
clericals.
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
as
i
indicated,
justice
kennedy,
i
think
that's
covered
by
this
court's
decisions
in
the
burns
case.
i
believe
the
successor
obligation
would
depend
on
how
many
of
the
p&le
employees
it
hired.
and
if
it
hired
a
majority
of
its
employees
from
the
p&le
work
force,
it
would
have
a
successor
obligation.
and,
in
fact,
in
this
case
it
contemplated
doing
that
and
had
already
started
negotiations
with
rail
labor
for
new
collective
bargaining
agreements
covering
those
employees
that
it
would
hire.
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
the
successor
employer's
obligations?
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
the
successor
really
has
no
obligation
to
bargain
over
the
effects.
the
seller...
something
going
out
of
business
has
the
effects
obligation.
the
successor
enters
the
world,
as
any
new
employer.
only
in
this
case
he
has
a
union
and
he
has
a
statutory
bargaining
obligation.
but
that's
by
virtue
of
how
he
hires
and
the
fact
that
the
entity...
employing
enterprise
is
basically
a
railroad
going
forward
only
with
new
employees.
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
that's
absolutely
correct,
justice
scalia.
they
could
simply
go
to
the
new
company
and
say,
"here
is
the
contract
like
we
want.
"
"we
want
to...
you
have
hired
the
majority
of
our
employees
and
we
want
a
new
contract,
and
we
want
all
these
provisions
in
our
new
contract
to
protect
us
from
the
employer
you
sell
to.
"
but
the
simple
fact
of
the
matter
is
we
had
no
bargaining
duty
under
this
court's
decision
in
first
national
maintenance.
we
don't
believe
we
had
an
effects
duty
at
all
because
of
the
unique
presence
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
but
regardless
of
whether
we
had
an
effects
duty
or
not,
we
did
not
violate
the
status
quo
in
this
case,
as
the
status
quo
has
come
to
be
known,
by
going
out
of
business.
simply
put,
we
were
not
changing
rates
of
pay,
rules,
or
working
conditions.
and
it
would
be...
i
think
it
would
create
an
unworkable
situation
if
every
time
a
management
transaction
were
going
forward,
as
in
this
case,
a
non-bargainable
decision,
if
rlea
could
serve
a
vast
panoply
of
notices
allegedly
addressed
to
effects
or
even
directly
addressed
to
effects--
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
--justice
o'connor,
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
had
provisions
dealing,
as
do
most,
dealing
with
furlough
and
dealing
with
pay
when
one
is
on
furlough
status.
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
yes,
it
is.
i
think--
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
--the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
you're
correct,
is
not
part
of
the
record.
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
not
at
all,
justice
o'connor.
it
has
been
stipulated
through
and
agreed
throughout...
and
i
believe
even
the
third
circuit
found...
that
what
p&le
was
proposing
to
do
did
not
in
any
way
violate
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
p&le
doesn't
have
to
look
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
this
case
for
its
right
to
go
out
of
business.
p&le's
right
to
go
out
of
business
is
a
fundamental
management
right,
as
we
argue
in
our
brief.
rlea--
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
--that's
correct.
but
rlea's
remedy
is--
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
--it's
stipulated
throughout
that
there
is
no
violation
of
the
agreement--
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
--by
p&le
going
out
of
business.
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
if
rlea
believed
the
agreements
were
violated
by
p&le
going
out
of
business
in
the
way
it
had
chosen
to
do
so,
or
if
they
agreed...
they
believed
that
p&le
had
ever
agreed
not
to
go
out
of
business,
their
remedy
would
have
been
to
file
a
grievance
saying
p&le
is
breaching--
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
--that's
correct.
then
say
p&le
is
breaching
its
collective
bargaining
agreement.
in
this
case
rlea
says
the
statute,
the
railway
labor
act...
not
the
contracts...
the
railway
labor
act
itself
operates
to
keep
p&le
from
going
out
of
business
and
that
is
just
totally
inconsistent
with
this
court's
rationale
in
darlington
and
first
national
maintenance.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
--oh,
absolutely.
and
in
this
particular
case,
as
we
pointed
out,
they
appeared--
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
--the
icc
in
the
p&le
proceeding
to
ask
the
icc
to
allow
them
to
buy
the
railroad.
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
they
asked
the
exemption
be
revoked.
they
asked
for
everything
except
labor
protections.
they
did
not
go
to
the
icc,
even
though,
as
rlea
points
out,
railco
did
not
intend
to
hire
the
full
p&le
complement--
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
--that
would
have
been
subject
to
judicial
review.
but
that
was
never
asked
of
the
icc
in
this
particular
occasion.
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
that
was
exactly
his
point.
and
he
specifically
noted
that
rlea
had
made
no
attempt
to
invoke
labor
protections
but
that
if
they
did,
they
had
a
right
of
recourse
to
the
court
of
appeals
should
their
request
for
labor
protections
be
denied.
what
rlea
has
here
today,
and
their
theory
here
today
is
an
elaborate
theory
that
says
ultimately
any
time
in
any
corporate
transaction,
icc
approved
or
not,
if
there
is
an
effect,
any
effect,
that
they
can
find
on
their
employees,
their
membership,
no
matter
what
the
cause
of
that
effect,
that
they
can
serve
notices
and
that
whatever
exists
that
day
has
to
remain
in
existence.
in
this
particular
case,
for
17
long
months.
i
specifically
heard
rlea's
counsel
say
that
there
couldn't
be
an
abandonment
filing,
that
p&le
couldn't
go
to
the
icc
and
say,
"we
quit.
"
"we
give
up.
"
"we
can't
find
a
buyer.
"
"we're
just
going
to
abandon.
"
they
could
serve
a
notice
there
and
say,
well,
they
can't
abandon.
they're
going
to
have
to
preserve
in
place
the
rates
of
pay,
rules
and
working
conditions
until
we
finish
the
bargaining
process
of
the
railway
labor
act.
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
that's
right.
their
initial
theory
is
that
any
threatened
action
that
would
affect,
i
believe,
the
agreement,
would
be
subject
to
a
bargaining
notice
by
us
to
them.
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
there's
the
injunction
case.
and
i
did
want
to
say
something
about
the
injunction
cases.
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
we
believe
that
judge
block's
injunction...
original
injunction
was
properly
entered.
we
believe,
as
i
indicated
to
you
in
my
earlier
presentation
about
the
interstate
commerce
act,
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
does
have
very
broad
discretion
to
address
the
effects
of
these
transactions
and
that
once
they
enter
that
order,
that
order
is
properly
reviewable
in
the
court
of
appeals.
but
that
a
strike...
and
the
district
court
expressly
found
here...
that
the
strike
was
designed
not
to
compel
railway
labor
act
bargaining
but
to
frustrate
this
transaction.
the
strike
should
have
been
enjoined
in
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
can
be
and
should
be
accommodated
to
the
orders
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
and,
moreover,
we
believe,
as
does
the
solicitor...
we
believe
there
was
absolutely
no
bargaining
duty.
and
where
there
is
no
duty
to
engage
in
collective
bargaining,
we
believe
that
an
injunction
will
rely
under
the
railway
labor
act,
section
2
first.
we
think
that
where
we
have
no
duty
to
bargain
and
where
we
aren't
violating
the
status
quo,
that
a
railway
labor
act
injunction
will
lie
to
prohibit
a
strike
and
2
first
would
be
the
proper
foundation
for
that
injunction.
so,
we
believe
that
the
injunction
was
properly
entered,
improperly
reversed.
we
think
the
third
circuit
was
just
wrong
when
it
said
norris-laguardia
shouldn't
be
accommodated
with
the
interstate
commerce
act.
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
i
think
congress
provided...
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
congress
provided
an
exclusive
set
of
remedies
for
the
union
and
i
think
it
deliberately
intended
to
take
away
from
the
union
the
strike
weapon.
i
think
it
provides
an
elaborate
mechanism.
it
gives
the
icc
tremendous
discretion
to
impose
labor
protective
conditions.
it
gives
the
union
rights
to
review
in
the
court
of
appeals.
it
gives...
if
labor
protections
are
imposed...
and
these
are,
by
the
way,
generally
far
more
than
contractual,
mere
preservation
of
contracts.
they
are
additional
protections
over
and
above.
but
if
they're
imposed,
the
icc
can
appoint
icc
arbitrators
to
hear
disputes
about
their...
about
the
use.
i
think
that's
a
classic
boy's
market
situation,
an
accommodation
to
an
administrative
scheme
of...
there
is
an
administrative
scheme
in
the
ica
and
i
think
norris-laguardia
has
to
be
accommodated
to
it
and
the
unions
should
use
it.
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
that
has
been
the
government's
position.
i
don't
think
the
government
has
directly
addressed
the
question
with
the
court
today
of
whether
they...
of
the
scope
and
power
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
i
think--
mr.
richard
l.
wyatt,
jr.
--i
believe
the
government...
and
i
don't
want
to
speak
for
the
government,
but
i
believe
under
their
analytical
framework,
even
had
there
been
an
effects
bargaining
obligation,
proper
notice
is
served.
and
those
are
all
major
assumptions.
had
p&le
engaged
in
that
bargaining
but
nonetheless
completed
the
transactions,
which
is
consistent
with
the
government's
theory,
a
railway
labor
act
injunction
would
lie
to
prohibit
the
strike.
i
did
want
to
address
my
closing
remarks
to
the
status
quo
argument
that's
been
made
here
today
by
rlea
and
their
reading
of
detroit
and
toledo
shoreline.
i
think
to
understand
detroit
and
toledo
shoreline
one
has
to
go
back
to
what
is
the
railway
labor
act's
prohibition
on
unilateral
action.
and
the
railway
labor
act
prohibits
in
section
2
seven
unilateral
action
that
would
change
rates
of
pay,
rules,
or
working
conditions
as
embodied
in
agreements.
now,
rlea
is
correct.
there
are
other
places
where
the
"as
embodied
in
the
agreement's"
language
doesn't
necessarily
appear.
but
i
think
detroit
and
toledo
shoreline
properly
read
says
that
a
working
practice
may
become
an
implied
agreement
between
the
parties.
in
that
case,
there
was
a
question
about
where
people
reported
to
work
and
there
was
a
unilateral
change.
i
don't
think
detroit
and
toledo
shoreline
can
be
read
any
broader
than
to
say
the
status
quo
is
composed
of
explicit
agreements
and
what
can
fairly
be
said
to
be
an
implicit
agreement.
and
i
think
the
notion
that
the
status
quo
is
composed
of
whatever
existed
on
the
property
on
the
day
the
notice
was
served
is
ludicrous
because
what
that
does
is
simply
take
away
from
management
whatever
preexisting
rights
it
had
that
day,
rights
that
hadn't
been
exercised.
it
simply
freezes
them
in
time.
and
that's
clearly
the
act
and
its
bargaining
obligations
and
it's
status
quo
obligation.
we're
not
intending
to
freeze
people
in
time
as
they
existed
on
day
one
or
day
two.
but
all
they're
meant
to
do...
i'm
sorry,
my
time
is
up.
