mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
actually
involves
a
misunderstanding
of
two
statutes
that
has
now
led
to
the
apparent
conflict
between
the
two
statutes.
but
when
you
go
back
to
the
actual
manner
in
which
the
statutes
were
implemented,
for
the
60-some
odd
years
that
they
existed
side-by-side
before
you
had
this
conflict,
there
was
no
conflict
between
the
two
statutes.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
corporate
decisions
of
a
carrier
that
do
not
affect
rates
of
pay,
rules
or
working
conditions,
do
not
change
rates
of
pay,
rules
or
working
conditions
do
not
require
notice
and
were
not...
there
is
no
status
quo
that
prohibits
the
implementation
of
such
a
corporate
decision.
the
only
time
that
you
have
a
conflict
between
the
two
statutes
is
where
the
parties,
the
carriers,
tend
to
use
the
interstate
commerce
act
to
justify
changes
in
existing
collectively-established
rates
of
pay,
rules
or
working
conditions.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
as
that
term
is
used
in
the
statue...
in
the
railway
labor
act,
yes,
your
honor.
but
this
is
not
a
going
out
of
business
case.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
because
what
is
going
to
happen
as
a
result
of
that
sale
is
that
p&le
will
continue...
under
the
terms
of
this
sale
p&le
railco
would
operate
the
railroad.
it
would
take
the
lines,
it
would
take
the
equipment,
and
it
would
take
some
of
the
employees.
but
what
it
would
do,
it
would
impose
entirely
new
rates
of
pay,
rules
or
working
conditions.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
your
honor--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--your
honor,
at
that
point
it
would
still
be
a
change
in
the
collective
agreements,
as
that
term
is
used
in
the
statute.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
it
is,
your
honor.
we
would
submit
it
would
still
be
a
change
and
it
would
require
notice.
but
that's
not
the
fact
because
in
this
case,
first
of
all,--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--the
p&le
is
not
going
out
of
business.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
your
honor,
we
draw
a
distinction
between
a
question
of
whether
you
can
bargain
over
the
decision
itself
and
over
the
effects.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
that's
not
the
position
we're
taking,
your
honor.
the
injunction
that
was
issued
in
this
case
sets
forth
the
position
quite
clearly.
and
that
injunction
says
the
p&le
is
enjoined
from
selling
in
a
way
that
it
changes
it
rates
of
pay,
rules
and
working
conditions.
it
may
sell
so
long
as
there
is
no
change.
namely,
that
railco
assumes
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
and
continues
to
operate.
that's
the
way
in
which
the
railway
labor
act
and
the
interstate
commerce
act
have
existed
side-by-side
for
60-some
odd
years.
when
you
look
at
the
republic
airlines
case
which
we
cited
to
the
court
in
one
of
the
footnotes,
the
national
mediation
board
pointed
out
that
what
has
happened
in
the
railroad
industry
as
a
result
of
mergers,
purchases,
and
uncontrolled
transactions
that
have
occurred
is
that
you
have
a
proliferation
of
agreements
on
the
pmr/kent
merger
in
the
'40s,
the
pmr/kent
rules
still
apply
on
the
c&o
part.
what
has
happened
is
when
a
railroad
takes
over
another
railroad's
operations,
it
takes
over
the
contracts.
the
only
difference
is
that
there's
now
a
new
name
on
the
paycheck
as
to
who
the
employer
is.
but
as
far
as
the
employees
are
concerned,
there
is
no
change
in
the
actual
rates
of
pay,
rules
or
work
conditions
that
are
established
by
the
contract.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
your
honor,
first
of
all
it
would
have
been
a
question
of
whether
or
not
they
had
the
icc
approval
to
do
so.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
if
they
had
the
icc
approval
to
do
so,
we
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
railway
labor
act
would
still
prohibit
that
form
of
a
change
because
it
is
a
change
as
that
term
was
used--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
there
would
be
someone
picking
up
the
paycheck
because
the
railroad
will
still
continue
operating.
there's
no--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--the
railway
labor
act
would
prohibit
them
from
doing
that.
but
that's
not
this
case.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
because,
your
honor,
it
says
that
any
time
a
carrier...
in
section
27...
any
time
a
carrier...
no
change
shall
be
made
in
rates
of
pay,
rules
or
working
conditions
as
a
class
as
embodied
in
the
agreements
except
in
the
manner
prescribed
in
the
agreements
or
in
section
6
of
the
act.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
this
is
where
we
get
back
to
the
legislative
history.
at
the
time
the
railway
labor
act
was
enacted,
it
was
enacted
for
an
industry
that
was
heavily
regulated,
an
industry
where
it
was
a
startling
innovation
to
believe
that
a
railroad
could
go
out
of
business
any
time
it
wanted.
railroads
couldn't
even
become
debtors
under
the
bankruptcy
act
as
it
existed
at
that
time.
and
it
wasn't
until
1933
that
they
were
allowed
to
even
become...
in
the
reorganization
under
the
bankruptcy
act.
the
only
way
they
could
restructure
financially
was
through
the
equity
receiverships.
this
was
the
understanding
that
congress
had
and
that
the
parties
had.
and
what
the
labor
representatives
who
drafted
the
bill
that
was
modified
in
some
forms
but
not
in
section
2
first
or
section
6
that
are
applicable
here,
indicated
to
congress
the
intent
of
that
statute
was
to
do.
it
was
to
implement
the
bargaining
obligation.
it
was
to
implement
the
requirement
that
the
railroad
labor
board
in
1920...
1921...
had
promulgated,
that
any
time
management
makes
a
decision
that
would
affect
rates
of
pay,
rules
or
working
conditions,
it
must
give
notice
and
it
must
bargain
with
the
employees.
so,
what
the
drafters
of
that
legislation
did...
and
they
specifically
sighted
wilson
v.
nu,
which
this
court
had
decided
in
1917,
which
dealt
with
congress'
power
to
regulate
railroads
and
to
impose
obligations
on
railroads...
and
they
said
we're
relying
upon
that
power
to
impose
an
obligation.
the
obligation
that
was
imposed,
because
of
the
great
transportation
needs
of
railroads
at
that
time,
which
we
submit
still
exist
to
a
degree
today
was
that
congress
was
not
going
to
allow
the
rail
industry
to
become
disrupted
by
labor
disputes.
but,
rather,
would
adopt
the
solution
that
management
and
labor
had
devised,
which
provided
that
any
time
there
is
to
be
a
change
in
working
conditions...
not
a
violation
of
the
agreement,
but
a
change...
and
the
expiration
of
a
contract
is
a
change.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
but
that's
not
this
act,
your
honor.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
because...
the
going
out
of
business
is
a
management
prerogative.
but
if
the
way
in
which
they
will
go
out
of
business
will
affect
rates
of
pay,
rules
and
working
conditions,
that
management
prerogative
is
limited
by
the
statute
which
says
there
has
to
be
bargaining
about
it
first.
the
example
that
your
honor
raised
in
an
earlier
case,
the
conrall
case,
is
a
perfect
example
of
what
i'm
talking
about
here
where
there
is
a
reporting
requirement.
assume
employees
had
to
report
to
work
at
7:45
in
the
morning
and
the
railroad
wanted
to
change
it
to
8:00
in
the
morning.
would
they
have
to
give
notice?
would
that
be
a
change
in
working
conditions?
it's
obviously
a
change
in
working
conditions
if
you're
moving
your
reporting
requirement
15
minutes.
but
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
notice
was
required
was
is
it
a
working
condition
that
is
embodied
in
collectively
established
agreements,
implied
and
explicit
or
written
agreements?
if
it
is,
even
though
it
might
not
be
prohibited
by
the
agreements,
it
is
still
the
type
of
thing
that
requires
advance
notice
before
the
carrier
does
it.
now,
on
the
other
hand,
if
it's
not,
as
would
typically
be
the
case,
what
then
comes
into
play
is
the
carrier
could
make
that
change
unless
the
union
believes
that
it
is
important
to
its
people
that
that
change
not
be
made.
in
which
case,
it
has
the
right
under
section
6
to
serve
what's
known
as
the
section
6
notice
to
request
bargaining
about
that
particular
change.
if
it
does,
then
an
entirely
different
concept...
and
this
is
the
concept
that
is
really
involved
here.
not
so
much
whether
it
is
an
obligation
to
bargain
over
the
impact
of
this
decision
on
employees,
but
what
are
the
ramifications
of
the
statute
during
that
bargaining
process.
and
that's
the
status
quo
obligation.
and
if
you
look
at
5
first
section
6
of
the
act,
and
section
10
of
the
act,
as
this
court
did
in
detroit
toledo,
and
as
the
language
clearly
shows,
in
2
seventh
and
6...
in
the
first
part
of
section
6
it
talks
about
changes
affecting
agreements
establishing
rates
of
pay,
rules
or
working
conditions.
and
then,
in
5
first,
it
says
that
during
that
bargaining
process
no
change
shall
be
made
in
agreements
affecting
rates
of
pay,
rules
or
working
conditions
or
established
practices.
and
in
section
10
of
the
act
it
says
that
during
the
dispute
process
no
change
shall
be
made
in
the
conditions
out
of
which
the
dispute
arose.
and
the
legislative
history,
as
this
court
pointed
out
just
20
years
ago
in
detroit
toledo,
was
that
the
language
was
broad.
it
was
intended
to
be
broad
because
the
concept
was
that
while
bargaining
was
going
on,
whether
it's
mandatory
bargaining
in
the
sense
that
the
carrier
has
to
give
the
notice
or
bargaining
because
the
union
gave
the
notice,
no
change
shall
be
made
in
the
actual
objective
working
conditions
broadly
conceived
which
are
involved
in
or
related
to
the
dispute
because--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--your
honor,
that
phrases
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
icc
is
a
labor
board.
what
role
does
the
icc
play--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--in
the
labor--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--such
as
in
the
cady
case,
your
honor,
where
they
allowed
the
use
of
the
employees.
we
would
submit
that
that
is
the
type
of
case
where
the
icc
would
exceed
its
jurisdiction.
it
has
no
right
to
determine
the
labor
relations
aspects.
what
the
icc's
role
in
labor
relations
in
that
sense...
and
it's
not
even
labor
relations...
the
icc's
role
on
labor
matters
is
a
minimum
standards
type
of
role.
it
provides
simply
what
is
the
public
interest
minimum
requirement
as
to
what
is
fair
and
equitable.
it
does
not...
and
this
goes
back
to
the
early
days
of
the
relationship
between
the
acts--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--that's
correct
your
honor.
but
this
court
said
in
lowden
that
the
fair
and
equitable
treatment
of
railroad
employees
is
essential
to
the
maintenance
of
an
uninterrupted
and
efficient
rail
service.
well,
railroad
employees
are
just
treated
shabbily.
when
their
interests
are
ignored,
two
things
happen.
one,
the
railroad
employees
naturally
react
by
using
their
economic
muscle.
the
second
thing
that
happens
is
the
efficiency
of
the
service.
that
a
high
efficient
morale
factor
would
improve
is
lost.
and
what
congress
has
recognized
from
back
in
the
'20s...
and
in
fact,
even
prior
to
that,
back
in
the
1800's,
1880's...
1887
when
the
interstate
commerce
act
was
enacted...
there
are
also
labor
problems.
the
two
were
different;
economic
regulations
are
different
than
labor
relations
regulations.
there
is
an
overlap
in
this
one
sense.
the
interstate
commerce
act
is
concerned
with
the
underlying
public
interest
in
an
efficient
rail
service.
the
railway
labor
act
is
concerned
with
preventing
disputes
over
labor
matters
from
reaching
the
level
of
interruption
to
commerce.
the
difference
between
the
two
acts
is
this.
the
railway
labor
act,
as
this
court
said
in
the
terminal
railroad
case,
is
not
concerned
whatsoever
with
the
fairness
or
the
equities
of
whatever
bargaining
agreement
might
be
reached.
the
interstate
commerce
act,
on
the
other
hand,
is.
so
what
congress
has
said...
and
this
is
right
in
the
1940
legislation
where
for
the
first
time
congress
required
imposed
protection.
the
reason...
prior
to
that,
four
years
earlier,
rail
labor
had
gotten
together
with
the
railroads
and
had
entered
into
the
washington
job
protection
agreement
which
formed
a
form
of
protection
for
railroad
employees.
when
congress
was
considering
in
1940
what
became
the
1940
transportation
act
where
employee
protection
was
imposed
as
a
mandatory
requirement,
the
position
that
rail
labor
took
was
they
were
asking
for
the
mandatory
protection.
and
it
was
asked,
why?
if
you
already
have
it
by
this
agreement,
why
do
we
have
to
make
it
mandatory?
and
the
answer
for
that
was
this.
only
85
percent
of
the
mileage
in
the
country
was
under
the
washington
job
protection
agreement.
there
were
others
who
refused
to
come
under
it.
there
were
other
employees
who
were
not
covered
by
it.
and
that's
what
congress
is
concerned
about.
the
interstate
commerce
act
makes
no
differentiation
at
all
between
represented
and
non-represented
employees.
it
applies
equally
to
all.
it
applies
equally
to
all
regardless
of
what
form
of
protection
they
might
have
gained
by
bargaining.
now,
what
happened
in
the
history
of
the
act
and
the
relationship
between
the
two
is
that
from
1940
to...
in
the
middle
40's
the
interstate
commerce
act
commission
was
developing
the
formal
protections.
then
when
the
interstate
commerce
commission
protections
didn't
keep
up
with
the
trend
and
the
development
of
the
washington
job
protection
in
the
industry,
and,
in
fact,
was
actually
below
the
washington
job,
the
unions
went
to
the
collective
bargaining
table
and
negotiated
collective
bargaining
agreements.
we've
cited
in
our
brief
several
cases.
and
if
you
look
at
the
major
merger
cases
in
the
'50s
and
the
'60s,
they
were
all
negotiated
agreements.
now,
the
icc
and
the
p&le
say
well,
they
were
all
negotiated
under
the
auspices
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
well,
the
interstate
commerce
act
doesn't
give
rail
labor
a
right
to
negotiate
anything
on
behalf
of
anybody.
the
railway
labor
act
does.
the
negotiation
that
reached
the
agreement
could
only
be
binding
on
the
employees
because
it
was
negotiation
under
the
railway
labor
act.
and
when
you
look
at
the
two
acts
what
you
see...
in
a
sense
it's
like
history.
then
this
isn't
a
matter
of
interpretation
of
law.
what
happened
in
the
past
60
years?
why
wasn't
there
a
conflict
between
the
two?
and
the
reason
there
was
no
conflict
was
because
the
two
acts
work
hand
in
hand
as
part
of
a
single
form
of
regulation
of
the
rail
industry.
the
interstate
commerce
act
with
its
mandatory
minimums,
the
railway
labor
act
with
an
ability
on
rail
labor's
part
to
either
accept,
as
they
did
in
many
cases,
the
mandatory
minimums,
or
to
negotiate
what
they
believed
was
fair
and
equitable.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
it
would
be
a
combination,
your
honor.
normally
the
agreements
were
reached
beforehand.
but,
for
instance
in
the
70s,
in
the
northern
lines
merger
case,
the
icc
first
turned
it
down
when
there
was
no
agreement.
and
then
an
agreement
was
reached
and
the
icc
approved
it.
in
some
of
the
other
cases,
the
icc
cases
which
were
cited
in
p&le's
brief,
the
agreements
were
entered
into
after
the
merger
actually
took
place.
the
milwaukee
case
is
an
example.
after
the
merger
occurred,
the
icc
imposed
conditions.
an
agreement
was
then
entered
into
which
modified
those
conditions
and
that
became
the
form
of
protection.
now,
in
1971...
1972...
this
court
decided
the
nemitz
case,
norfolk
and
western
railroad
v.
nemitz.
and
in
that
case
it
said
that
even
though
you
have
this
negotiated
form
of
protection
and
the
icc's
role
up
to
that
point
was
that
it's
policy
was
you
have
a
negotiated
agreement,
fine,
we
don't
look
at
it.
this
court
said
that
that
was
wrong
and
that
that
was
actually
a
part
of
the
order
of
the
commission
and
rail
labor
could
not
substantially
abrogate
whatever
had
in
fact
been
negotiated
or
imposed
by
the
icc.
so,
there
is
a
relationship
in
this
way.
the
rail
labor
can
negotiate
an
agreement.
but
if
that
agreement
doesn't
meet
the
minimum
standards,
the
floor
that
the
statute
imposes,
then
the
icc
still
has
to
impose
that
floor.
if
the
agreement
exceeds
the
floor
and
it
is
adopted
as
the
protection,
then
that
becomes
part
of
the
icc
order.
but
the
parties
cannot
substantially
abrogate
below
the
floor.
now,
when
you
look
at
the
acts
in
this
light
and
you
remember
the
fact
that
notice
is
only
required
where
there
is
a
change
in
working
conditions
caused
by
the
agreement,
there
is
no
conflict
between
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
railway
labor
act.
the
only
time
you
get
a
conflict
between
the
two
acts
is
what
has
occurred
in
this
case
where
the
carrier's
relying
upon
the
icc's
belief
that
it
is
this
labor
board
now
say,
well,
wait
a
minute,
we
can
sell,
we
can
abrogate
your
contracts
and
you
can't
bargain
about
it,
and
you
can't
insist
that
we
bargain
about
it.
and
that
is
where
the
conflict
occurs.
now,
on
this
one
point,
i
point
out
that
the
policy
that
we're
talking
about,
the
ex
parte
392
policy,
is
a
creation
not
of
congress
but
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
itself.
where
congress
has
considered
and
developed
programs
such
as
the
feeder
line
programs,
it
specifically
provided
various
forms
of
protection
that
would
apply
and
how
employees
would
be
treated
as
a
minimum
level.
but
this
is
one
that
the
chairman
of
the
icc
has
stated
was
an
unpleasant
surprise,
an
unexpected
gain
out
of
the
regulation.
this
encouragement
of
short-line
programs.
and
the
only
reason
it
has
been
so
popular
is
because
for
the
first
time
the
railroads
are
using
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
authority
as
a
means
to
abrogate
existing
agreements,
to
change
the
agreements
and
not
bargain
about
it.
and
we
submit
that
that's
not
in
any
way
near
the
intent
of
the
relationship
between
the
two
acts.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
your
honor,
there
is
some
indication,
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
in
the
icc's
decision,
talking
about
the
p&le's
railco,
the
new
company's
proposed
rules.
the
one
thing
that
is
clear
from
the
record
is
that
p&le
at
that
time
had
approximately
600
organized
employees,
agreement
employees,
as
the
term
is
used.
the
railco,
p&le
railco,
the
new
company,
intended
to
use
only
approximately
220
to
perform
that
same
type
of
operation.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
p&le
fully--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
no
passenger
service.
there's
a
182
mile-system
with
around
200
and
some
odd
miles
from--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
not
quite
cleveland,
but
youngstown
and
that
area.
and
then
there's
some
track
that's--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
neuenschwander
testified...
he's
the
president
of
the
p&le...
that...
and
this
is
in
the
transcript
and
part
of
the
joint
appendix...
that
the
p&le
railco
intended
to
operate
in
the
same
manner,
the
same
lines,
the
same
equipment,
and
service
the
same
customers,
and
even
adopt
the
contracts
that
dealt
with
those
customers.
the
only
contract
that
would
not
be
assumed
and
honored
were
the
collective
bargaining
agreements.
and
that's
what
would
allow
the
reduction
in
operations.
now,
i
might,
add
because
i
realize
my
time...
my
time
is
fleeting
on
this...
the
status
quo
that
is
required
to
be
maintained
by
the
act
is
not
at
the
government
submits
and
as
the
p&le
submits,
simply
the
agreements
or
contractual
rights...
contractual
limitations
and
contractual
authorizations.
rather,
the
status
quo,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
detroit
toledo
case,
is
much
broader.
it
extends
to
the
actual
objective
working
conditions
broadly
conceived.
also--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--your
honor,
we're
not
saying
and
the
injunction
did
not
prohibit
p&le
from
selling.
the
corporate
owner
is
immaterial
to
the
status
quo.
the
court
did
not
enjoin
the
sale.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
not
to
honor
the
agreements
that
were
in
place.
and
those
agreements,
i
might
add...
contrary
to
what
p&le
has
informed
the
court...
did
contain
employee
protections
that
required
a
guaranteed
form
of
employment.
but
we
acknowledge
that
once
the
sale
occurs
and
the
carrier
no
longer
operates,
unless
there's
a
carryover
of
agreements
by
the
new
carrier,
those
agreements
would
terminate.
and
i
might
add
there
is
no
need
for
any
remand
to
determine
what
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
provide
because
the
record
is
quite
clear
in
this
case
that
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
provide
that
the
employees
are
the
ones
who
operate
the
p&le
trains.
and
in
the
1926
act
when
mr.
richburg
was
asked
what
is
meant
by
the
conditions
out
of
which
a
dispute
arose,
he
specifically
stated
that
the
conditions
out
of
which
the
dispute
arose
include,
at
the
very
least,
the
basic
employment
relationship
itself.
and
that's
the
point
that
we're
getting
at.
what
will
happen
by
this
sale
is
that
the
p&le
as
far
as
the
public
is
concerned...
as
far
as
the
public
interests
are
concerned...
will
continue
to
operate.
the
only
people
who
will
be
affected
by
this
sale
are
the
employees
who
have
the
contractual
right
to
perform
that
work.
rail
labor
agreements
are
unlike
other
agreements
in
that
they
do
not
have
specific
termination
dates.
they
do
not
run
from
september
1st
of
one
year
to,
say,
august
31st
of
another
year.
rather,
they're
indefinite.
they
have
no
termination
dates.
and
that's
the
result
of
the
status
quo
provision
and
the
carryover.
but
the
point
is
these
agreements
are
in
effect
right
now
and
they
require
that
these
people
do
the
operation.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
it
would
do
what
was
known
as
a
short-line
operation.
the
p&le
is
a
traditional
operation
that
has
craft
lines.
a
short-line
operation,
as
that
term
is
coming
to
be
used
in
the
industry
today,
is
one
that
blends
craft
lines.
so,
you
have
an
electrician
do
a
sheet
metal
worker's
work.
but
the
point
that
i
wish
to
emphasize...
and
i
realize
my
time
is
fleeting...
is
that
the
status
quo
injunction
of
the
court
does
not
prohibit
layoffs
of
employees.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
your
honor,
it's
in
the
petition--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--at
page
85...
84(a)
and
85(a).
and
the
last
paragraph
is
the
important
one.
"it
is
further
ordered
that
the
sale
of
defendant's
assets
is
enjoined
to
the
extent
that
such
sale
does
not
include
provisions
for
the
maintenance
of
the
status
quo.
"
"that
is,
provisions
prohibiting
the
alteration
of
rates
of
pay,
rules
and
working
conditions
existing
at
the
time
section
6
notices
were
given.
"
"the
injunction
hereby
ordered
shall
remain
in
effect
until
the
time
the
dispute
resolution
procedure
set
forth
in
the
railway
labor
act
have
been
completed.
"
and
that
brings
me
to
the
final
point
on
this.
and
that
is
that
the
one
thing
that
is
being
ignored
in
this...
the
icc
is
considered
to
be
the
protector
of
the
public
interest.
it
is
the
protector
of
the
public
interest
in
rail
economic
transportation
matters.
but
the
protector
of
the
public
interest
in
labor
matters
is
the
national
mediation
board.
and
the
national
mediation
board
is
the
agency
which
now
has
jurisdiction
over
this
labor
dispute.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
your
honor,
we
submit
it
is
not.
the
carrier
can
enter
into
any
sale
contract
it
wants.
but
the
point
is
that
it
cannot
change
as
a
result
of
that
sale
contract.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
your
honor,
it
can
cut
its
costs
through
the
legitimate
process
of
the
railway
labor
act
in
bargaining.
that
is
what's
going
on
right
now
with
the
p&le.
they're
using
the
bargaining
process
to
address
the
cost
factors.
but
the
railroad
cannot
use
the
interstate
commerce
act
to
cut
its
labor
costs.
that's
where
we
have
the
distinction.
congress
and
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
deregulation
affected
by
the
interstate
commerce
act
only
deregulated
rail
economic
relations.
it
did
not
deregulate
labor
relations.
it
didn't
touch
the
railway
labor
act.
and
the
exemption
in
this
case
is,
as
10505
indicates,
is
an
exemption
from
the
requirements
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
in
no
way
can
that
be
read,
we
submit,
to
give
an
exemption
from
the
railway
labor
act
as
well.
the
only
way
you
could
read
it
that
way
is
to
say
that
the
interstate
commerce
act
carries
with
it
a
right
to
regulate
rail
labor
relations
matters,
rail
collective
bargaining
agreements
in
both
the
floor
and
the
top.
and
be
submit
it
does
not.
and
that
brings
up...
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
okay.
that
brings
up
the
final
question
as
to--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
your
honor,
if
employees
are
treated
fairly
and
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
are
not
abrogate,
there
will
be
no
strike.
but
what
you
have
to
remember
in
comparing
the
two
is
the
interstate
commerce
act
is
a
permissive
legislation.
congress
specifically
refused
to
adopt
a
compulsive
form
of
legislation.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
your
honor,
it
has
in
the
past.
there
was
a
tremendous
mixing
of
the
industry
in
the
past.
we've
gone
down
from
hundreds
of
carriers
to
about
11
trunk
line
carriers.
but
we've
gone
down
in
that
sort
of
thing
by
each
carrier
being
absorbed,
being
continued
in
the
same
form
it
was
before.
and
then
if
you...
you
can
immediately
implement
your
corporate
transaction
and
if
you
want
to
consummate
any...
effectuate
any
change
in
working
conditions,
you
use
the
railway
labor
act's
bargaining
processes
to
negotiate
that.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
your
honor,
there
could
be
if
it
is
done
properly.
and
if
it's
done
through
the
bargaining
process,
you
can...
because
the
bargaining
process
is
not
an
end.
it's
just
simply
the
beginning
of
the
process
that
has
an
end
in
sight.
but
to
short-change
it,
to
short-shift
it,
what
it
comes
down
to
is
this.
if
the
interstate
commerce
act
has
the
effect
that
the
p&le
says
it
has,
what
that
means
is
that
the
commission
can
impose
an
order
which
gives
the
railroad
the
right
to
make
a
contract
in
secret
with
another
party
and
that
that
contract
can
abrogate
the
existing
agreements.
the
railroad
can
accept
it
or
reject
it
and
the
unions
have
no
say
whatsoever.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
i
believe
that's
correct
but
i
can't
be
certain.
but
it
would
have
been
subject
to
review
in
the
court
of
appeals.
