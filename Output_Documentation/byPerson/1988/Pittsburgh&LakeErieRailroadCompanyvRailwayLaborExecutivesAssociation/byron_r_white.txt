justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
well--
justice
byron
r.
white
--the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
decision
to
sell
wasn't
bargainable.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
even
if
the
united
states
is
right
that
you
had
to
bargain
over
effects,
i
take
it
that
the
united
states
would
say
that
you
may
effectuate
the
transaction
as
soon
as
you
want.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
surely
any
bargaining
over
effects
is
gone.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
if
your
bargaining
agreement
said
that
if
we
go
out
of
business
here's
some
things
we
have
to
do,
why,
you
would
have
to
do
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it's
stipulated
that
that
isn't
the
case
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes?
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
have
it
decided
by
a
board.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
makes
it
even
more
complicated.
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
judgment
here
in
your
mind
should
be
reversed,
at
least
to
that
extent?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
take
it
that
if
they
have
to
bargain
over
effects,
if
as
soon
as
they
close
the
transaction,
the
bargaining
duty
is
over?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
railroad
just
has
to
bargain
in
good
faith.
but
it
doesn't
have
to
wait
on...
it
doesn't
have
to
delay
the
closing.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
at
least
no
one
has
claimed
that
they're
violated.
they
haven't
gone
to
an
adjustment
board.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
would
give
the
employees
no
rights
upon
the
sale?
may
the...
i
thought
the
icc
could
nevertheless
impose
labor
protective--
justice
byron
r.
white
--even
though
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
isn't
violated
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
icc
isn't
here,
but
the
company
certainly
is
and
it
is
pressing
the
icc
position.
and
i
haven't
heard
a
whole
lot
from
you...
you
won't...
you
won't
express
an
opinion
about
some
of
the
questions
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
--that
i
would
think
is
necessary
to
decide
whether
the
icc
position
is
correct
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
you...
well,
you
wouldn't...
suppose
the
icc
imposes
some
labor
protective
provisions,
all
that
it
thinks
are
necessary.
must
a
company
then
bargain
with
the
union
over
other
and
different
ones?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then--
justice
byron
r.
white
--that
seems
to
me
a
rather
critical
question
if
you're
going
to
resolve
this
claim,
that
the
icc...
that
the
interstate
commerce
act
preempts
the
rla
in
these
sale
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
that's
a...
i
think,
as
justice
o'connor
indicated,
if
you're
going
to
exempt
it,
it
seems
to
me
that
they've
said
no
labor
protective
provisions
are
necessary.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
they
just
said,
we've
considered
everything
we
think
is
relevant,
no
labor
protective
positions
will
be
imposed.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
then
you
think
the
company
nevertheless
has
to
bargain
with
the
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
isn't...
i
can't
believe
that's
the
inference
you
would
draw.
i
would
think
they
would
think
that
we're
approving
this
transaction
for
the
benefit
of
the
public.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
we
just
don't
think
that
any
labor
protective
provisions
are
appropriate.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
guess
we
have
to
read--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
on
that
basis
the
company
has
to
obey
whatever
are
the
most
rigorous
conditions
that
are
imposed.
either
the
icc
or
what
the
union
wants.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
nobody
would
be
picking
up...
nobody
then
would
be
picking
up
the
paychecks?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
see.
yeah.
so,
in
effect,
you
say
if
they
aren't
going
to
sell
to
somebody
but
just
go
out
of
business,
they
can't
do
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
where
do
we
find
the
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
petition?
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
wasn't
going
to
say
a
word.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you
mean
is
that
the
railroad
may
not
implement
its
deal
unless
it
imposes
on
the
successor
the
same
agreement.
justice
byron
r.
white
--are
not
going
to
be
any
of
these
mergers.
none
of
these
short-line
operations.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
just
ask
you
a
question?
does
the
union
have
a...
can't
the
union
appear
before
the
icc?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
did
they
ever
ask
that
the
exemption
be
revoked?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
they
had
asked
for
labor
protection
and
it
had
been
turned
down,
i
suppose
that
was
subject
to
judicial
review?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
actually,
on
their
theory
they
don't...
they
wouldn't
have
to
serve
a
notice.
they
would
just
go
to
court
and
say
you're
threatening
to
change
the
agreement
and
they
want
an
injunction.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
have
some
things
you
want
to
say
but
what
about...
isn't
there
another
case
before
us?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
the
union
has
an
obligation
not
to
strike
until
and
unless
or
even
if
it
does
exhaust
the
remedies
it
has
before
the
icc?
