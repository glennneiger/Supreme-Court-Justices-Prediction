how
fundamental
is
that
right
not
to
go
out
of
business?
can
the
interstate
commerce
commission
prevent
a
railroad
from
going...
it
can
certainly
prevent
a
railroad
that
stays
in
business
from
abandoning
certain
parts
of
its
operations.
can
the
interstate
commerce
commission
compel
a
railroad
to
continue
to
serve
if
it
really
wants
to
go
entirely
out
of
business?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
theoretically
all
we're
talking
about
here.
a
delay
of
exit,
i
suppose.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
do
acknowledge
that...
and
i
don't
see
that
this
is
entirely
consistent.
you
do
acknowledge
that
if
anything
you
were
doing
in
connection
with
the
sale
violated
your
labor
agreement,
then
the
provisions
of
the
rail
labor
act
would
apply
and
it
would
be
a
major
dispute
and
would
have
to
go
through
that
mechanism.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
there
were,
suppose
your
contract
said
the
company
will
not
go
out
of
business
for
20
years.
that's
what
your
collective
bargaining
agreement
says.
and
then
you
try
to
sell
within
the
20
years.
what...
what
would
be...
do
you
think
that
the
icc's
approval
would
be
an
end
of
the
matter?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they
could
make
the
same
claims
that
they
were
making
against
your
company...
made
against
your
company.
they
would
be
effects
claims.
they
could
make
the
very
same
claims
against
the
new
company,
they
just
wouldn't
be
effects
claims.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
minear,
you
may
be
right
about
which
of
these
two
statutes
triumphs
here
but
it
seems
to
me
a
closed
question.
you're
essentially
making
the
argument
that
the
specific
governs
the
general.
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
think
the
railway
labor
act
deals
with
labor
relations.
but
it
depends
on
how
you
slice...
how
you
slice
the
cake.
you
could
say
that
the
interstate
commerce
act
deals
more
specifically
with
the
consequences
of
going
out
of
business.
if
you
choose
to
look
at
this
as
a
going
out
of
business
problem,
the
interstate
commerce
act
is
the
more
specific
statute
and
should
govern.
if
you
choose
to
look
at
it
as
a
labor
problem,
the
railway
labor
act
is
the
more
specific
and
should
govern.
i
don't...
i
don't
have
any
clue
as
to
why
you
should
look
at
it
as
the
one
rather
than
as
the
other.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
would
your...
your
principle
that
the
employer
can
go
out
of
business
despite
the
bargaining
obligation,
would
that
extend
to
the
proposition
that
the
employer
can
sign
a
sales
contract
despite
the
existence
of
the
bargaining
obligation?
specifically,
the
union
hears
that
there's
a
deal
in
the
works.
so,
it
comes
in
and
says
we
want
to
bargain
about
post-effects.
okay?
the
deal
hasn't
yet
been
signed.
would
the...
would
the
railroad
violate
its
good
faith
obligation
to
bargain
about
after-deal
effects
if
it
went
ahead
and
signed
the
agreement
that
in
fact
did
not
impose
these
protections?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
sort
of
hard
to
consider
it
good
faith
bargaining
if
even
at
the
moment
that
you're
talking
to
the
unions
about
whether
these
protections
should
be
there
you're
signing
a
deal
that
doesn't
contain
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
minear,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
that
is
related
to
that?
i'm
sorry
the
icc
is
not
here.
they
would
assert
that
whatever
they
said
would
govern,
correct?
contrary
to
the
position
that
you've
taken.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
the
icc...
which
you
say
shouldn't
even
be
here
anyway...
had
their
way,
if
they
said
that
a
railroad
can
get
out
of
business,
it
can
get
out
of
business
and
all
the
labor
consequences
are
resolved
in
its
judgment.
do
you
know
if
they
would
take
the
position
that...
well,
let
me...
do
the
labor
protective
provisions
that
the
icc
is
allowed
to
include,
do
they
embrace
labor
protective
provisions
that
merely
consist
of
the
obligations
that
the
company
has
under
its
existing
contract?
that
is,
suppose
this
contract
said
that
if
i
go
out
of
business
i
will
retain
the
employment
of
everybody
who...
my
successor
will
retain
the
employment
of
everybody
who
is
here,
would
the
icc
feel
authorized
to
insert
that
as
one
of
the
labor
protective
provisions?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
sure.
it
can
undo
it
to
the
detriment
of
whoever
is
asking
the
permission.
it
can
undo
contractual
provisions
to
the
detriment
of
the
railroad
who
is
requesting
the
permission.
when
it
imposes
labor
protective
provisions
it's
essentially
imposing
labor
obligations
that
they
don't
have.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
i
suppose.
you
make
a
big
point
of
the
fact
that
10901
does
not
contain
any
provision
superseding
otherwise
applicable
law,
as
you
put
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
the
railway
labor
act
have
a
provision
explicitly
superseding
otherwise
applicable
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
it's
a
standoff
as
far
as
that
goes,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
just
have
to
decide
what's
the
applicable
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
you
do
have
to
be...
said
for
you
that
although
section
113
does
contain
provisions
explicitly
overriding
other
law...
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
11341
is
the
section.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
they
just
went
out
of
business
and
sold
it
to
nobody,
then
it
would
be
different?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
then
there
would
be
no
work,
no
working
conditions.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
not
a
change
in
working
conditions.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
there's
a
whole
law
as
to
what's
working
conditions,
just
as
to
there's
a
whole
law
as
to
what
are
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
understand
that.
but,
still,
you
will
acknowledge
that
not
everything
is
a
working
condition.
justice
antonin
scalia
whether
i
choose
to
subcontract
some
of
my
work,
for
example,--
justice
antonin
scalia
--there
are
management
prerogatives.
and
why
isn't
going
out
of
business
a
management
prerogative?
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
do
you
mean
by
the
public
interest
standard
as
to
what's
fair
and
equitable?
it's
always
just
the
employee's
interests
you're
talking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
amendments
to
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
intended
to
allow
railroads
to
go
out
of
business,
to
merge,
to
do
all
sorts
of
things
and
to
do
so
promptly,
are
really
frustrated
if
they
are
going
to
be
interpreted
the
way
you
are.
so
that
it's
not
only
effects
that
must
be
bargained
but
even
the
making
of
the
new
contract.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
just
can't
cut
its
costs.
that's
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
what
can
happen
after
all
of
this
occurs
and
it
goes
to...
you
go
through
the
lengthy
process,
the
union
can
strike
against
the
sale
of
the
railroad
ultimately.
or
even
against
the
railroad's
going
out
of
business.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
that's
what
was
envisioned
by
the
interstate
commerce
act
amendments?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they
also
thought
there
was
going
to
be
a
lot
of
fluidity
in
the
rail
industry
with
mergers
and
all
sorts
of
things,
which
i
doubt
would
happen
very
readily
if
they
could
be
halted
by
strikes.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
government
does
not
agree
with
you
on
this
point,
i
gather,
since
they
agreed
that
there
would
be
a
duty
to
bargain
on
the
effects
until
such
time
as
the
sale
was
concluded.
justice
antonin
scalia
although
they--
--well,
they
don't
seem
to
want
to
do
it.
the
government
might
have
agreed
with
this
particular
injunction
because
there
might
have
been
no
right
to
strike
even
at
this
point,
even
if
there
was
a...
under
the
railway
labor
act
even
if
there
was
a
duty
to
bargain.
