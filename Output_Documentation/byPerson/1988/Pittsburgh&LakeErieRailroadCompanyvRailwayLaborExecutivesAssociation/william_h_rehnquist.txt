[recess.]
we'll
resume
the
argument
where
we
left
off,
mr.
wyatt.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
ask
you,
if
i
may.
is
it
your
contention
that
the
decision...
p&le's
decision
to
sell
was
not
what
in
the
words
of
the
rla
is
some
respecting
rates
of
pay,
rules
or
working
conditions
that
shouldn't
be
altered
by
the
carrier?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
therefore
there
should
have
been
no
status
quo.
there
should
have
been
no
injunction
for
bidding
the
sale.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
although
perhaps
you
did
have
a
duty
to
bargain
about
the
effects.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
about
the
necessary
consequences
of
your
decision
to
sell?
didn't
that
mean
a
change
in
working
conditions
or
rates
of
pay
or
rules
for
some
of
the
employees
under
the
successor?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wyatt.
mr.
minear.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
government's
position,
mr.
minear,
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
the
district
court
should
have
entered
a
status
quo
injunction
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
it
have
a
position?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
that...
what
is
the
position?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
the
district
court
have,
as
it
did
here,
forbade
p&le
from
going
ahead
with
the
sale?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
if
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
didn't
prohibit
that,
then
it
should
not
have
prohibited
the
sale?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
we
know
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
if
there
is
no
preemption
provision...
they
come
across
the
finish
line
equal,
don't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
mr.
clarke,
we'll
hear
from
you
now.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
that's
not
a
meaningful
distinction
though,
i
don't
think.
if
you're
saying
that
the
p&le
is
perfectly
free
to
decide
to
go
out
of
business
or
decide
to
sell
but
it
can't
proceed
to
go
ahead
and
consummate
the
transaction
unless
it
goes
through
this
bargaining--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
why
would
the
district
court...
could
the
district
court
properly
have
done
on
the
hypothesis
that
p&le
simply
says
we
are
going
out
of
business,
period?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
supposing
they
did?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
the
railway
labor
act
prohibit
them
from
doing
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
assumes
the
point
we're
talking
about,
i
thought,
whether
this
is
a
change.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
clarke--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
do
we
know
from
the
record
about
how
p&le
operations
will
compare
after
the
sale
and
before
the
sale?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
before
the
sale
p&le
was
running
trains?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
freight
trains?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
only
freight
trains?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
from
pittsburgh
to
cleveland?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
after
the
sale,
were
the
trains
still
going
to
be
running?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
could
read
detroit
just
the
way
you
say
it
should
be
read
and
the
way
it's
spoke.
and
saying
it
didn't
have
to
be
something
in
writing
and
still
not
feel
that
it
goes
to...
you
know,
who
is
the
corporate
owner.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
status
quo
is
violated,
you
say,
by
the
plan
of
the
successor
to
use
only
one-third
of
the
employees?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
successor
company
ever
explain
how
it
was
going
to
do
the
same
work
with
only
200
of
the
600
employees?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
clarke.
mr.
wyatt,
you
have
eight
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
judge
hutchinson's
point
in
his
dissent
in
the
third
circuit
too,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wasn't
that
part
of
judge
hutchinson's
point
in
his
dissent
in
the
third
circuit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wyatt.
the
case
is
submitted.
