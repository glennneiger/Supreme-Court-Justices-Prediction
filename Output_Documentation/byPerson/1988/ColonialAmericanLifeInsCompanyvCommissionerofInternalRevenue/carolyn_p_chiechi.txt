thank
you,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
insurance,
the
type
of
insurance
that
is
issued
by
one
insurance
company
to
another,
and
that
is
known
as
indemnity
reinsurance.
just
as
an
insurance
company
normally
incurs
substantial
expenses
when
it
issues
insurance
to
members
of
the
general
public,
such
as
you
and
me,
an
insurance
company
also
normally
incurs
substantial
expenses
when
it
issues
indemnity
reinsurance.
it
is
undisputed
that
the
expenses
of
issuing
directly
written
insurance
are
to
be
deducted
currently.
the
issue
that
this
court
must
resolve
is
whether
the
expenses
of
issuing
the
type
of
insurance
known
as
indemnity
reinsurance
are
also
to
be
deducted
currently.
it
is
the
position
of
the
petitioner
colonial
american
life
insurance
company
that
just
as
the
expenses
of
issuing
directly
written
insurance
are
to
be
deducted
currently,
so
are
the
expenses
of
issuing
indemnity
reinsurance.
section--
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
--that
is
one
way
to
phrase
it,
justice
stevens.
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
no,
justice
stevens.
but
there
is
a
specific
provision
that
congress
provided
in
part
i
of
subchapter
l
of
the
code
to
deal
with
the
ceding
commission
expense
that
is
involved
in
indemnity
reinsurance.
although
you
are
right,
justice
stevens,
that
you
also
could
have
a
deduction
just
as
you
have
for
directly
written
insurance
under
sections
809(d)(12)
and
162.
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
yes,
justice
scalia.
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
yes,
justice
scalia.
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
in
the
year
that
a
directly
written
insurance
policy
is
issued,
an
insurance
company,
in
connection
with
what
it
would
pay
the
sales
agents
incurs
the
sales
agent's
expense,
sometimes
in
the
range
of
about
60
percent
of
the
initial
premium
on
ordinary
whole
life
insurance.
thereafter,
each
year
there
is
what's
known
as
a
renewal
premium
which
is
a
much
less
percentage,
which
is
paid
only
if
the
insurance
is
continued
in
force.
in
the
case
of
indemnity
reinsurance
and
the
particular
insurance
involved
in
this
case,
there
was
the
initial
ceding
commission
paid
in
a
fixed
amount
and
thereafter
there
was
a
requirement
that
the
reinsurer,
colonial,
pay
a
specified
percentage
of
premiums
thereafter.
i
believe
it
was
about
five
percent
in
each
of
the
agreements.
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
yes.
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
in
the
regard
that
you
were
raising.
yes,
absolutely.
if
i
may
continue.
as
i
was
saying,
there
is
a
specific
provision
in
part
i
of
subchapter
l
of
the
internal
revenue
code
as
amplified
by
the
regulations.
and
that
is
section
809(c)(1)
which
requires
that
the
ceding
commission
expense
involved
in
this
case
be
deducted
currently.
the
commissioner
concedes
that
indemnity
reinsurance,
like
directly
written
insurance,
is
the
issuance
of
insurance.
with
one
exception,
he
does
not
dispute
that
the
provisions
of
part
i
of
subchapter
l
treat
indemnity
reinsurance
as
the
issuance
of
insurance.
and
it
is
this
one
exception
that
relates
to
the
issue
in
this
case.
according
to
the
commissioner,
he
would
like
this
court
to
treat
indemnity
reinsurance
like
directly
written
insurance
in
all
respects
except
with
respect
to
the
expenses
of
issuing
that
insurance.
in
support
of
this
position,
the
commissioner
contends
that
some
so-called
general
or
fundamental
tax
principle
is
controlling,
and
requires
that
such
commissions
be
capitalized
and
amortizing...
amortized.
in
support
of
his
position,
the
commissioner
says
that
just
as
an
insurance
company
in
an
assumption
reinsurance
transaction
acquires
an
asset
consisting
of
insurance
policies
which
will
generate
a
future
income
stream,
so
does
an
indemnity
reinsurer
when
it
issues
its
reinsurance
contract
acquire
an
asset
consisting
of
a
future
income
stream
and
that
therefore
the
ceding
commission
is
paid
to
acquire
that
asset.

ms.

--excuse
me,

ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
we
believe
it's
both
but
you
need
not
reach
the
second
phrase
in
the
statute,
justice
o'connor,
because
clearly
the
term
return
premium,
as
amplified
by
the
regulations
under
section
809(c)(1)
provides
that
the
term
return
premiums
is
to
include
amounts
of
premiums
or
other
consideration
returned
to
another
life
insurance
company
in
respect
of--
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
--that--
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
--that
assertion
i
believe
is
unfounded.
i
have
found
no
support
for
it
in
the
statue,
which
is
clear
on
its
face,
and
the
regulations
under
the
statute,
or
in
the
legislative
history.
concededly,
in
connection
with
another
provision,
congress
made
the
observation
in
the
senate
finance
report
that
returns
by
life
insurance
company
respective
indemnity
reinsurance,
which
also
cover
experience
refunds...
but
the
regulations
which
amplify
the
meaning
of
the
term
return
premiums
have
no
such
qualification
in
them
whatsoever.
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
we
believe
that
it
could--
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
--we
don't...
we
don't
elaborate
on
that
argument,
justice
kennedy,
because
we
believe
that
it's
clear
that
return
premiums
cover
the
ceding
commissions,
but...
and,
therefore,
that
you
wouldn't
have
to
reach
the
second
phrase.
but
we
think
the
second
phrase
equally
could
cover
it.
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
no.
no,
justice.
return
premiums...
there
is
a
comma
after
return
premiums
in
the--
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
--i
cannot
speak
for
counsel
for
the
commissioner.
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
in
the
long
run?
i'm
really
not
sure.
the
code
clearly
provides
for
current
deduction.
i'm
not
sure
what
your
question
is
getting
at,
justice.
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
yes.
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
well,
if
what
you
are
suggesting
is
that
this
is
a
question
of
timing,
that
is
true.
but
it's
a
timing
that
congress
considered
and
that
congress
required
the
timing
be
controlled
by
section
809(c)(1).
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
no,
it
was
not,
justice.
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
decision
of
the
tax
court
that's
been
reviewed
by
the
full
court,
but
there
have
been,
i
think,
five
decisions
that
have
been
handed
down
since
the
first
case,
beneficial
life,
in
1982
decided
this
question.
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
well,
that
proves
our
point,
justice
o'connor,
in
that
congress
believed
that
the
rules
it
otherwise
prescribed
in
part
i
of
subchapter
l
govern
indemnity
reinsurance
just
as
they
govern
directly
written
insurance.
but
it
realized
that
in
the
case
of
a
certain
type
of
indemnity
reinsurance,
what's
known
as
modified
coinsurance,
it
you
applied
those
rules
as
they
were
written,
you
might
have
the
potential
for
double
taxation.
and
so
that
is
why
congress
enacted
section
820.
and
i
think
that's
to
me
just
a
reaffirmance
of
its
intention
that
the
rules
otherwise
applied
it
to
directly
as
well
as
indemnity
reinsurance.
if
i
may
continue.
as
i
have
said,
there
is
a
specific
provision
in
the
code,
section
809(c)(1)
which
we
believe
clearly
allows
the
current
deduction
in
calculating
premium
income
of
ceding
commissions.
but
just
as
the
expenses
of
issuing
directly
written
insurance
are
currently
deductible
under
section
809(d)(12)
which
incorporate
section
162
of
the
code,
we
believe
that
the
expenses
of
issuing
indemnity
reinsurance,
the
ceding
commission,
in
the
alternative,
is
also
deductible
under
section
809(d)(12)
and
162.
the
commissioner
disagrees
and
he
tries
to
argue
that
any
analogy
between
ceding
commissions
and
indemnity
reinsurance
and
the
agent's
commissions
in
directly
written
insurance
is
a
false
analogy.
that
contention
is
unfounded
and
misses
the
point.
the
point
is
that
ceding
commissions
incurred
in
issuing
indemnity
reinsurance
are
the
normal
usual
expenses
that
an
insurance
company
incurs
when
it
issues
insurance
to
another
insurance
company.
agents'
commissions
incurred
in
connection
with
directly
written
insurance
are
the
normal
usual
expenses
incurred
by
an
insurance
company.
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
well--
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
--well,
in
a
sense
it
is
a
price
rebate,
when
you
have
just
two
parties
involved.
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
and
we
are
not
suggesting
in
any
way
that
three
parties
is
necessary
to
resolve
this
issue.
in
fact,
you
can
have
a
sales
agent
who
sells
himself
insurance
and
he
still
gets
the
commission
from
his
insurance
company.
whether
you
have
two-party
or
three-party
is
irrelevant
to
resolution
of
this
issue,
and
in
fact
probably
why
congress
put
this
provision
for
the
ceding
commission
part
of
the
expense
and
indemnity
reinsurance
in
809(c)(1)
was
precisely
because
it
was
in
a
sense
a
price
rebate
and...
in
the
context
of
a
two-party
situation.
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
yes,
it
would
be
includible
in--
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
--not
as
far
as
i'm
aware.
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
in
a
footnote
in
our
reply
brief
we
point
that
out.
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
no,
it
cannot
be.
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
i'm
sorry.
i
thought
you
said
the
reinsurer.
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
i'm
sorry,
justice
kennedy--
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
--when
you
say
reinsurance
company,
are
you
talking
about
the
ceding
company,
the
policyholder?
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
the
reinsurer
cannot
cancel
any
more
than
a
life
insurance
company
can
cancel
a
life
insurance
policy
that
you've
purchased.
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
if
i
may
continue,
the
result
which
we
urge
in
this
case,
the
809(c)(1)
requirement
that
the
ceding
commission
be
excluded
in
full
in
the
year
in
which
it
is
paid,
or,
alternatively,
that
809(d)(12)
and
section
162
would
require
the
same
result,
is
totally
consistent
with
the
manner
in
which
insurance
companies
would
treat
the
commission
under
any
naic
accounting.
that
is,
the
accounting
prescribed
by
the
national
association
of
insurance
commissioners.
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
yes,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
indemnity
reinsurance
is
like
directly
written
insurance.
it's
the
issuance
of
insurance
and
the
beginning,
then,
of
a
continuing
insurance
relationship.
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
no.
not
indemnity
reinsurance.
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
there
is
a
separate
insurance
policy
that
is
issued
by
the
reinsurer
in
indemnity
reinsurance
to
its
policyholder,
the
ceding
company.
that
insurance
contract
does
not
alter
or
disturb
in
any
way
the
other
existing
insurance
relationship
between
the
ceding
company
and
its
policyholders.
in
contrast,
in
an
assumption
reinsurance
transaction,
one
insurance
company
acquires
existing
insurance
contracts
and
therefore
acquires
the
position
or
the
relationship
of
the
selling
company
in--
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
--yes.
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
yes.
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
yes.
exactly.
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
it
is
generally
considered
to
be
a
novation.
there
are
some
jurisdictions
where
there
is
a
secondary
liability
by
the
selling--
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
--but
generally
it
is--
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
--if
the
policyholders
consent,
justice
scalia,
and
there
are
in
fact--
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
--yes.
yes.
as
i
was
saying,
the
treatment
urged
by
colonial
is
totally
consistent
with
naic
accounting,
and,
therefore,
we
believe
that
the
requirement
of
section
818(a)
of
the
code,
as
interpreted
by
this
court
in
the
standard
life
case,
is
fully
satisfied
because
naic
accounting
is
to
apply
except
where
the
rules
of
accrual
accounting
require
a
different
result.
now,
the
commissioner
argues
that
naic
accounting
does
not
apply
because
the
rules
of
accrual
accounting
require
that...
and
this
is
his
phrase...
"the
acquisition
costs
of
a
future
benefit
be
capitalized.
"
in
support
of
that
argument,
he
relies
on
a
regulation
under
section
461
that
applies
to
accrual
method
taxpayers.
the
commissioner
is
wrong
in
suggesting
that
the
requirement
to
capitalize
so-called
acquisition
costs
of
a
future
benefit
is
a
rule
imposed
by
accrual
method
accounting.
that
is
a
rule
that
is
imposed
by
a
regulation
under
section
446
of
the
code
and
it
applies
regardless
of
the
method
of
accounting
that
the
taxpayer
is
on.
whether
you're
on
accrual
method,
cash
method,
or
any
other
method.
and
the
commissioner
is
just
misleading
in
suggesting
that
because
that
requirement
appears
in
the
regulation
under
section
461,
applicable
to
accrual
method
taxpayers,
that
it's
an
accrual
method
rule,
because
the
same
requirement
appears
in
the
461
regulations
that
apply
to
cash
method
taxpayers.
but,
of
course,
this
case
does
not
involve
acquisition
costs
of
a
future
benefit.
it
involves
indemnity
reinsurance
and
the
ceding
commissions
incurred
in
issuing
that
insurance.
the
rules
of
accrual
accounting
do
not
speak
to
the
character
as
a
currently
deductible
expense
or
as
a
capital
item
of
the
ceding
commissions
incurred
in
issuing
indemnity
reinsurance,
any
more
than
they
speak
to
the
character
as
a
currently
deductible
expense
or
as
a
capital
item
of
the
expenses
incurred
in
issuing
directly
written
insurance.
in
fact,
if
the
commissioner
were
correct
that
the
rules
of
accrual
accounting
require
that
ceding
commissions
in
indemnity
reinsurance
be
capitalized,
they
would
also
necessarily
require
that
directly
written
expenses
be
capitalized.
yet,
he
agrees
here,
as
he
always
has,
that
the
expenses
in
issuing
directly
written
insurance
are
to
be
deducted
currently.
and
thus
he
concedes
that
the
rules
of
accrual
accounting
do
not
require
a
contrary
result.
this
court
should
not
countenance
the
commissioner's
disregard
of
the
special
provisions
in
part
i
of
subchapter
l
which
are
based
on
naic
accounting.
the
commissioner's
disregard
of
those
rules
simply
should
not
be
countenanced
here.
resort
to
some
general
or
fundamental
tax
principle
that
might
be
applicable
to
any
other
taxpayer
in
any
other
setting
to
resolve
the
tax
treatment
of
the
ceding
commissions
involved
in
this
case
will
produce
an
unsound
result
that
is
contrary
to
part
i
of
subchapter
l,
the
legislative
history,
and
the
regulations
thereunder.
i
would
like
to
reserve
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
yes,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
the
problem
with
the
commissioner's
argument
is
that
it
starts
from
the
wrong
premise
and
it
goes
in
the
wrong
door
and
it's
going
to
come
out
the
wrong
end.
it
starts
from
the
premise
that
indemnity
reinsurance
is
the
acquisition
of
an
asset,
and
in
getting
to
that
conclusion
the
commissioner
focuses
on
just
one
aspect
of
indemnity
reinsurance,
the
right
to
future
premium
income
assuming
the
policy
stays
in
force.
this
is
what
directly
written
insurance
is
all
about
as
well.
there
is
an
expectation
of
receiving
future
premium
income.
and
yet
it's
not
correct
to
focus
only
on
that
aspect
of
directly
written
insurance
and
cut
it
up,
slice
it
up,
and
say,
well,
just
because
you
have
this
future
premium
income
that
you
expect
to
get,
that
somehow
you're
acquiring
an
asset.
and
it's
no
more
correct
to
do
that
in
indemnity
reinsurance.

commissioner's
counsel

the
reason
why...
what
the
counsel
said
was
that
the
reason
why
directly
written
expenses
are
currently
deductible
is
because
of
some
provision
in
the
congressional
legislative
history
of
part
i,
subchapter
l.

do
not
agree
with
that.
if
the
reason
why
expenses
incurred
in
directly
written
insurance
are
currently
deductible
is
because
the
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
under
section
162
and
section
818
says
that
unless
contrary
to
accrual
accounting
rules,
the
naic
accounting
is
to
apply,
and
directly
written
expenses
are
currently
deductible
in
naic
accounting.
the
legislative
history
on
which
the
counsel
relies
states
as
follows,
"small,
new
and
growing
life
insurance
companies
are
particularly
likely
to
have
underwriting
losses
because
of
the
initial
costs
which
they
incur
such
as
agents'
commissions
in
placing
new
policies
on
their
books.
"
well,
these
are
costs
in
this
case
which
are
incurred
in
placing
new
policies
on
the
books
of
the
indemnity
reinsurer
and
the
reference
to
"such
as
agents'
commissions"
is
by
no
means
an
all-exclusive
reference.

it's
different,
but
it's
not
relevant
to
the
determination
here.
and,
in
any
event,
as
i
said
before,
justice
stevens,--
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
--and
a
price
rebate.
and
that's
why
i
think
congress
put
it
in
under
809(c)(1).
it's
a
return
premium
to
reduce
the
price
otherwise
that
would
be
paid
in
the
two-party
situation.
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
but
that's
not
what
indemnity
reinsurance
is
about.
indemnity
reinsurance
is
not
acquiring
an
asset
any
more
than
directly
written
insurance
is
acquiring
an
asset.
the
reference
to
this
exhibit
where
it
stated
that
it's
a
safe
and
profitable
investment
and
a
seasonable
and
predictable
block
of
business,
well,
any
insurance
company
in
its
right
mind--
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
--it
got
in
return
the
issuance
of
insurance,
and
that
was
the
cost
of
issuing
that
insurance.
just
as
the
cost
of
issuing
directly
written
insurance
is
to
pay
50
or
60
percent
to
sales
agents,
to
pay
underwriting
costs,
medical
examination
fees,
state
premium
tax,
and
other
costs.
if
an
indemnity
reinsurer
wants
to
do
business,
it
pays...
it
normally
pays
a
ceding
commission.
if
a
direct
writer
wants
to
sell
policies
very
effectively,
it
normally
uses
sales
agents.
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
with
due
respect,
transport
is
as
much
a
policyholder
of
the
reinsurer
colonial
as
you
or
i
would
be
policyholders
of
an
insurance
contract
with
an
insurance
company.
there
are
two
insurance
relationships
when
you
have
indemnity
reinsurance.
the
separate
insurance
relationship
that
the
ceding
company
establishes
with
its
policyholders
and
then
that
ceding
company
becomes
a
policyholder
and
buys
insurance
from
a
reinsurer.
in
contrast,
in
assumption
reinsurance
there
is
one
insurance
relationship.
the
buying
company
acquires
the
position
of
the
selling
company,
taking
the
selling
company
out
of
an
existing
insurance
relationship.
and
it's
because
the
buying
company
is
buying
that
relationship
that
the
regulations
under
section
817
require
that
purchase
price
to
be
amortized.
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
well,
it's
in
a
sense
a
price
rebate.
it's
also
strange
for
an
individual
sales
agent
to--
ms.
carolyn
p.
chiechi
--the
commissioner's
counsel
suggests
repeatedly
that
there
needs
to
be
some
specific
provision
to
allow
the
deduction
which
we
seek
here.
he's
got
it
backwards.
it
is
quite
clear
in
the
legislative
history
in
the
senate
finance
report
dealing
with
the
modified
coinsurance
that
congress
intended
that
an
indemnity
reinsurer
be
treated
in
substantially
the
same
tax
position
that
it
would
have
been
treated
if
it
had
issued
directly
the
underlying
policy
or
part
thereof.
the
only
way
that
can
be
accomplished
is
if
the
petitioner's
position
here
is
accepted.
in
terms
of
standard
life
and
naic
accounting,
i'm
glad
to
see
that
the
commissioner
has
backed
off
his
position
that
accrual
accounting
rules
apply
in
this
case
because
he
must
have
done
that
having
said
that
this
is
not
an
accounting
question.
well,
what
section
818(a)
addresses
is
computations
entering
into
the
calculation
of
taxable
income
of
an
insurance
company,
and
if
the
rules
of
accrual
accounting
do
not
apply,
then
naic
accounting
is
to
apply.
thank
you.
