justice
stevens
well,
one
could
phrase
it
differently.
one
could
really
ask
whether
this
is
an
expense
of...
when
one
pays
the
seller
of
the
insurance
what
would
normally
be
a
commission
if
paid
to
a
third
party,
whether
that's
an
expense
or
not.
justice
stevens
because
it's
clear
if
it
is
an
expense,
it's
deductible
currently.
there
is
no
quarrel
about
that.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
there
is
this
difference,
and
i
wish
you
would
comment
on
it
a
little
bit.
in
the
reinsurance
situation,
the
insurance
company
that
is
in
effect
buying
the
insurance
is
the
recipient
of
the
commission.
whereas,
in
the
ordinary
original
insurance
situation,
the
agent
who
receives
the
commission
is
the
nature
of
a
third
party.
and
it
is
very
unusual
to
say
that
when
you
pay
someone
a
consideration
because
he's
selling
you
something,
that
that's
like
a
commission.
it's
a
very
different
situation.
justice
stevens
it's
in
effect
a
change
in
the
purchase
price.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
another
question.
is
it
clear
that
the
recipient
of
the
ceding
commission
would
have
that...
the
commission
taxable
as
ordinary
income?
justice
stevens
your
opponents
don't
disagree
with
that,
do
they?
justice
stevens
it's
funny.
nobody
seemed
to
discuss
that.
but
one
would--
justice
stevens
--thank
you.
can
the
reinsurance
contract
be
cancelled
by
the
reinsurer?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask...
because
i
want
to
be
sure
i
find
this
out
at
the
beginning.
justice
stevens
is
the
receipt
of
the
ceding
commission
taxable
as
ordinary
income?
justice
stevens
then
why
isn't
the
government
kind
of
getting...
getting
it
both
ways
in
a
sense.
justice
stevens
no,
but
that
would
normally
be
taxable
as
a
capital
gains,
of
course.
but
normally
if
you
have
an
item
paid
to
a
third-party
agent,
or
something
like
that,
if
it's
an
expense
to
the
payer,
it's
normally
income
to
the
payee
and
vice
versa.
isn't
it?
or
maybe
i'm--
justice
stevens
--can
you
give
me
another
example?
you
say
there
are
many
of
them.
i
just
don't
know
that
much
about
tax
law.
another
example
in
which
a
payment
of
this
character
would
be
ordinary
income
to
the
recipient
and
not
deductible
to
the
payer.
justice
stevens
can
you
give
me
an
example
that
happens
in
the
real
world?
justice
stevens
would
you
agree
that
for
some
purposes
the
code
does
draw
a
distinction
between
indemnity
reinsurance
transactions
and
assumption
reinsurance
transactions?
justice
stevens
does
it...
for
example,
in
an
assumption
reinsurance
transaction
i
take
it
the
money
received
by
the
ceding
company
is
not
taxable
as
ordinary
income.
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
a
ceding
company...
for
something
equivalent
to
a
ceding
commission
would
not
be
taxable
in
that
transaction
as
ordinary
income
to
the
ceding
company?
justice
stevens
put
it
in
that--
justice
stevens
--so
that
even
if
it's
a
capital
transaction,
the
selling
company...
the
receipt
of
the
ceding
commission
by
the
selling
company
would
be
ordinary
income?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
could
you
tell
me
one...
just
an
example
of
a
difference
in
tax
treatment
between
the
two
kinds
of
transactions?
justice
stevens
and
the
indemnity
reinsurance.
yes.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
but
isn't
there
the
distinction
that
justice
scalia
mentioned
earlier?
that
in
one
case
the
company
acquires
the
direct
relationship
with
the
original
policyholders
and
not
in
the
other
case.
justice
stevens
of
course,
i
think
one
could
argue
in
the
same
way,
that
they
should
treat
the
two
kinds
of
reinsurance
as
the
same
for
all
purposes.
but
we
don't
do
that.
justice
stevens
well,
it
is
understood...
or,
agreed
by
both
parties
that
congress
really
didn't
think
much
about
ceding
commissions?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
you
keep
going
by
the
fact
that
the
agent's
commission
is
paid
to
a
third
party.
it's
like
paying
a
salesman.
here
the
amount
is
in
effect
a
rebate
to
the
reinsuring
company.
that's
quite
a
different
situation
on
its
face,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
stevens
it
does
seem
like
a
discount
from
the
purchase
price
of--
