ms.
chiechi--
justice
scalia
--do
i
say
your
name
right?
justice
scalia
what...
what
does
an
insurance
company
do
by
way
of
the
expenses
of
an
agent?
it
was
my
impression
that
an
agent
who
writes
a
policy
gets
commissions
over
the
term
of
the
policy.
as
the
policyholder
pays
the
commission
to
the
company,
the
company
will
reimburse
the
agent
annually
for...
you
know,
on
the
basis
of
the
money
received
in
the
future.
it's
not
my
impression
that
the
insurance
company
would
immediately
seek
to
take
a
write-off
of
future...
in
a
way,
that
is
all
expenditure
that
is
incurred
at
the
time
that
he
brings
the
policyholder
to
the
company,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
oh,
there
was.
i'd
forgotten
it.
justice
scalia
and
so
you
think
it's
about
equivalent
to
what
they
do
with
the--
justice
scalia
is
it
really
a
novation?
is
the
original
insurance
company
off
the
hook
as
far
as
the
policyholder
is
concerned?
justice
scalia
i
would
think
so.
justice
scalia
how
can
you--
justice
scalia
--you
normally
can't
get
out
of
a
contract
with
me
by
just
giving
it
to
somebody
else
and
writing
me
a
letter
saying
you--
justice
scalia
--if
they
consent,
then
there
would
be
a
novation?
justice
scalia
mr.
dreeben,
what
does
that
other
phrase
in...
in
(c)(1)
mean
in
your
estimation?
premiums
and
other
consideration
arising
out
of
reinsurance
ceded.
what
does
that
refer
to?
justice
scalia
now,
wait.
you're
talking
about
money
going
from
the
ceding
company
to
the
acquiring
company?
justice
scalia
i
thought
the
money
goes
the
other
way.
justice
scalia
when
doesn't
it?
justice
scalia
but
that
is
still
considered
reinsurance
ceded--
justice
scalia
--when
you're
buying
just
an
annual
renewable
term
policy?
justice
scalia
okay.
justice
scalia
what
a
strange
way
to
say
it.
why
wouldn't
they
just
say
other
than
premiums
and
other
consideration
paid
for
reinsurance
ceded,
or
something
of
that
sort?
justice
scalia
arising
out
of...
i
would
think
that
it...
it
reverses
who
is
getting
the
consideration.
justice
scalia
what
a
strange
way
to
say
it.
justice
scalia
if
they
meant
what
you
say
they
meant.
justice
scalia
and
that's
a
consideration
arising
out
of...
right?
justice
scalia
all
right.
and
doesn't
the
treasury
regulation
define
return
premiums
for
us
in
a
way
that
supports
the
taxpayer's
view
here?
justice
scalia
i'm
fascinated
with
this
language
of
(c)(1).
suppose...
suppose
i'm
an
insurance
company
and
i
have
policies
and
i
want
to
reinsure
some
of
the
policies
for
three
years.
all
right?
i
just
want
to
buy
reinsurance
so
if
i
have
to
pay
out
any
money,
i'll
get
reimbursed
for
at
least
part
of
it.
and
i
buy
a
three-year
reinsurance
policy
from
another
insurance
company.
under
(c)(1)
would
i
deduct
all
of...
and
i
pay
up
front
for
the
whole
three
years...
would
i
deduct
that
in
the
current
year
or
would
i...
would
i...
would
i
take
the
deduction
over
three
years?
justice
scalia
not
yet
been
paid.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
all
right.
justice
scalia
and
that...
that's
consistent
with
your
position
at
the
other
end?
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
justice
scalia
the
government
points
out
that
congress
has
explicitly
provided
that
you
do
not
treat
agent's
commissions
the
way
the
government
urges
this
ought
to
be
treated.
justice
scalia
what
makes
it
hard
to
go
along
with
you
is
you
say
buys
the
reinsurance.
it
buys...
that
is
to
say
sells
because
it's
the
only
purchase
transaction
i'm
aware
of
in
which
the
purchaser
receives
money
instead
of
paying
money.
you're
saying
they
buy
insurance
by
receiving
money
from
the
person
to
whom
they're
selling
it.
that's
a
very
strange--
justice
scalia
--it's
a
price...
i
know
of
no
price
rebate
that
is...
that
is
so
extensive
that
the
purchaser
gets
money
when
he
goes
in.
i
don't
know.
you
make
up
the
loss
on
volume,
i--
[laughter]
