--ms.
chiechi--
justice
o'connor
--would
you
explain
to
me
how
you
read
809(c)(1),
now,
that's
a
section
of
the
code
that
talks
about
premiums.
justice
o'connor
and
yet
you
say
that
it
incorporates
this
whole
concept
of
deduction
of
ceding--
justice
o'connor
--commissions.
justice
o'connor
now,
do
you
say
that
this
is
a
return
premium
or
do
you
say
it's
other
consideration
arising
out
of
reinsurance
ceded?
justice
o'connor
well,
the
government
says
the
words
"return
premiums"
apply
only
to
premium
income
which
either
an
initial
insurer
or
a
reinsurer
has
to
return
to
the
policyholder
due
to
mortality
experience
or
other
contractual
obligations.
that
it
just
doesn't
include--
justice
o'connor
--ceding
commissions.
justice
o'connor
the
legislative
history
argument
that
you
make
seems
to
have
occurred
only
in
a
discussion
of
the
nature
of
indemnity
reinsurance
dealing
with
the
problem
of
double
taxation
of
modified
coinsurance
agreements.
i'm
not
sure
that
the
history
you
refer
to
really
occurred
in
the
context
that
this
case
arises.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
would
think
that
your
arguments
could
be
made
equally
with
regard
to
the
original
insurance
company
in
the
deduction
of
commissions.
it
just
seems
to
me
that
your
theory
would
be
equally
applicable
there.
and
yet
congress
has
chosen
to
allow
the
immediate
deduction--
justice
o'connor
--of
the
commissions.
justice
o'connor
right.
justice
o'connor
and
you
can
read
809(c)(1),
as
the
taxpayer
reads
it,
as
an
indication
that
congress
likewise
intended
to
make
the
same
provision
for
reinsurance
ceding
commissions.
justice
o'connor
well,
it
says
less
return
premiums
and
premiums
and
other
consideration
arising
out
of
reinsurance
ceded.
i
mean,
you
certainly
can
read
it
the
way
the
taxpayer
does,
and
five
different
tax
court
panels
have
so
read
it.
and
you've
got
a
treasury
regulation
that
includes
within
the
definition
of
returned
premiums
amounts
of
premiums
or
other
consideration
returned
to
another
life
insurance
company
in
respect
to
reinsurance
ceded.
i
mean,
you
can
certainly
read
that
as
support
of
the
taxpayer
position.
so,
it's
a
little
hard
to
understand...
i
mean,
i
can
understand
your
argument
as
a
matter
of
policy.
but
it
certainly
can
support
the
taxpayers
and
the
tax
courts'
view
of
this
thing.
justice
o'connor
well,
you
can
sure
read
it
that
way.
just
like
you
can
read
this
second
phrase
here
that
way.
