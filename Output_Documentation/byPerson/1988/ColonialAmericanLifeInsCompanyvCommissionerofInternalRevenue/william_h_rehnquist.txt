we'll

argument
next
in
no.
88-396,
colonial
american
life
insurance
company
v.
commissioner
of
internal
revenue.
ms.
chiechi,
you
may
begin
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
ms.
chiechi--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--in
the
government's
brief
and
in
your
brief,
too
much
is
made
of
the
distinction
between
indemnity
reinsurance
and
assumption
reinsurance.
the
government
says
that
everybody
agrees
that...
and
if
you're
dealing
with
assumption
reinsurance,
the
commissions
would
have
to
be
treated
differently.
what,
in
short,
is
the
difference
between
assumption
reinsurance
and
indemnity
reinsurance?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it's
really
a
novation
between
the
second--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--no?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
is
a
novation
and--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--that
is
a
new
deal
between--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--the
second
insurance
company
and
the
policyholder.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
chiechi.
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr....
to
say
that
the
sections
relied
on
by
petitioner
have
nothing
to
do
with
it...
you
don't
deny
that
the
language
that
we've
been
talking
about
could
fairly
be
read
to
include
those...
just
reading
the
language
itself...
do
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
about
"and
other
consideration
arising
out
of
reinsurance
ceded?
"
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
set
forth
809(d)(7)
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
ms.
chiechi,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--but
you
can't
deduct
all
of
the
purchase
price
in
one
year,
can
you?
if
you
are
purchasing
insurance...
if
you're
buying
a
stream
of
income
in
the
form
of
the
second
company
buying
from
the
first
company,
you
couldn't
deduct
all
the
purchase
price
in
the
first
year?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but,
surely
you're
paying
money
for
something.
colonial
life
paid
out
to
transport
cash
and
it
got
in
return
something
it
wanted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
it's
not
as
if
the
indemnity...
it's
not
as
if
transport
were
itself
an
insured
in
the
same
way
that
the
policyholder
in
a
single
deal
is
an
insured,
is
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
chiechi.
the
case
is
submitted.
