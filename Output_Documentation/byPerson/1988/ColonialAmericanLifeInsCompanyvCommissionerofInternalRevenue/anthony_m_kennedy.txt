well,
do
you
argue
that
the
last
clause
in
premiums
and
other
consideration
"arising
out
of
reinsurance
ceded"
would
cover
your
case
if
return
premiums
do
not?

do
you
argue
that
in
your
brief?
justice

what
about
the
phrase
"arising
out
of
reinsurance
ceded",
does
that
modify
return
premiums?

do
both
parties
agree
on
that?

in
the
long-run
as
a
practical
matter,
would
you...
will
you
be
better
off
with
deductibility
or
with
amortization?
do
you
know?
justice
kennedy
well,
that's
a
difference
also
in
this

it?

your...
in
the

we're
talking
about

justice
kennedy
right.
justice
kennedy
can
those
payments
by
the
initial
insurer
ever
be
called
return
premiums,
or
are
they
under
this
second
clause
that
you're
discussing?
justice
kennedy
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
justice
kennedy
in
any
of
the
five
tax
court
decisions
that
gave
a
ruling
in
favor
of
the
petitioner,
did
the
tax
court
rely
on
the
second
clause,
the
"arising
out
of"
clause?
