mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--considered--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
ceding
commission
is
paid
to
acquire
a
future
stream
of
income
from
a
block
of
life
insurance
policies.
under
well-established
tax
principles,
that
kind
of
an
outlay
is
capital
in
nature
and
cannot
be
deducted
in
full
in
the
year
incurred.
there
is
no
provision
in
the
life
insurance
company
income
tax
act
of
1959
that
overrides
this
fundamental
rule
to
allow--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
to
the
ceding
company
it
is.
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
it's
not
unusual,
your
honor,
for
a
receipt
of
a
payment
for
an
asset
to
be
taxable
in
full
in
the
year
that
it's
received.
so,
i
don't
think
that
this
is
a
departure
from--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
necessary
parallelism
between
them.
as
to
the
capital
gains
point,
there
are
many,
many
situations
where
one
party
pays
an
acquisition
cost
and
has
to
amortize
it
and
the
other
party
has
to
receive
the
income
and
pay
taxes
on
it
in
the
year
of
receipt.
here
the
capital
gains
question
doesn't
arise
at
all
because
congress
has
specifically
provided
that
the
sale
of
an
insurance
policy
is
not
subject
to
favorable
capital
gains
treatment.
it
has
to
be
taxed
on
ordinary
income
basis.
so
there
really
is
no
connection
whatsoever
between
the
tax
treatment
for
the
ceding
company
and--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
you
can
imagine
many
situations
that
would
be
somewhat
similar.
whether
all
of
these
happen
in
the
real
world
is
unclear.
but
if--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
take,
for
example,
an
auto
company
that
sells
cars
and
takes
installment
loans
back
from
its
customers
and
then
discounts
those
loans
away
to
a
third
party
that
purchases
the
loans
today,
giving
the
car
company
that
sold
the
loans
a
slightly
smaller
amount
of
money
than
the
face
value
of
the
loans
to
reflect
the
time
value
of
the
money.
the
car
company
that
receives
the
money
would
have
to
take
that
into
income
in
the
year
it's
received.
on
the
other
hand,
the
discounter
who
purchases
the
notes
would
have
to
amortize
its
purchase
price
over
the
life
during
which
the
notes
were
expected
to
produce
income.
so,
that
is
an
example
which
is
in
many
ways
parallel
to
the
situation
that
we
have
here
because
petitioner
entered
into
this
transaction
and
agreed
to
pay
a
ceding
commission
precisely
because
it
anticipated
receiving
future
profits
in
the
form
of
premium
and
other
income
from
the
block
of
policies
that
it
reinsured.
this
isn't
just
the
commissioner's
point
of
view
about
the
matter.
this
is
what
the
record
unequivocally
shows
was
petitioner's
anticipated
benefit
when
it
entered
into
this
transaction.
there
is
an
exhibit,
joint
exhibit
6-f,
part
8,
which
was
entered
into
the
record
in
the
tax
court,
which
was
a
letter
from
an
actuary
proposing
this
transaction
to
petitioner
and
informing
petitioner
about
the
potential
benefits
that
it
might
realize.
and
it
wrote,
"these
reinsurance
treaties
have
been
constructed
to
minimize
loss
to
colonial
american.
"
"this
is
a
seasoned
and
predictable
block
of
business
with
virtually
all
policies
over
five
years
old.
"
"a
computer
projection
of
future
profits
was
made
and
that
projection
showed
that
colonial's
pre-tax
profit
on
the
reinsurance
transaction
will
be
about
$80,000.
"
and
the
letter
concluded
on
this
basis.
"the
transport
reinsurance
arrangement
should
be
a
safe
and
profitable
investment.
"
and
i
submit
that
that
is
not
what
anyone
has
in
mind
when
one
talks
about
an
insurance
company
writing
a
policy
of
insurance.
an
insurance
company
does
not
view
the
policy
of
insurance
as
a
safe
and
profitable
investment
the
way
petitioner
did
when
it
paid
a
ceding
commission
to
acquire
rights
from
a
block
of
policies
that
would
produce
income
for
it
stretching
over
a
period
of
seven
years,
in
this
case.
there
are
many
contexts
where
this
court
has
considered
basic
rules
of
capitalization
as
they
apply
to
companies
in
a
variety
of
industries.
and
at
bottom
the
question
always
comes
down
to
whether
there
has
been
a
purchase
price
paid
for
the
acquisition
of
a
future
benefit
that
will
stretch
more
than
one
tax
year.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct,
justice--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--o'connor.
well,
i
agree,
first
of
all,
that
the
theory
is
applicable
to
agent's
commissions.
and
the
only
reason
why
agent's
commissions
are
not
required
to
be
amortized
over
the
life
of
the
policy
is
because
congress
has
specifically
and
unequivocally
indicated
in
legislative--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--materials
that
they
are
not
to
be.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
think
that
there
is
anything
in
the
background
of
809(c)(1)
or
in
its
language
that
directly
covers
a
ceding
commission.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
let
me
make
two
points
in
response
to
that,
justice
o'connor.
first
of
all,
i
do
think
that
the
plain
language
of
the
regulations
can
be
read
to
support
our
position
and
not
their
position.
but
it's
very
important
in
construing
a
fairly
technical
tax
act,
such
as
this,
to
take
a
look
at
the
problems
that
congress
had
identified
and
was
trying
to
solve
when
it
wrote
the
sections
that
are
in
question.
now,
as
you
pointed
out,
in
petitioner's
argument
809(c)(1)
is
focused
on
the
determination
of
premium
income
to
an
insurance
company.
and
then
it
provides
for
certain
deductions.
the
theory
of
the
case
that
we
presented...
and
two
courts
of
appeals
have
written
opinions
extensively
that
accept
this
theory...
is
that
that
provision
was
designed
to
allow
insurance
companies
to
eliminate
from
their
premium
income
amounts
that
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight
never
would
have
been
included
in
it
in
the
first
place
because
they
were
amounts
that
a
company
turned
over
to
a
second
company
to
obtain
indemnity
reinsurance
or
they
were
amounts
that
had
to
be
paid
back
to
policyholders.
and
that's
what
congress
meant
by
return
premiums.
it
didn't
mean
the
purchase
price
of
an
income
stream
from
a
block
of
policies
in
a
fairly
complicated
indemnity
transaction.
and
i
say
that
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
any
of
the
legislative
materials
or
the
hearings
that's
been
pointed
out
by
any
party
to
this
case
in
the
years
of
litigation
that
shows
that
congress
ever
thought
about
ceding
commissions,
let
alone
thought
about
them
in
the
fashion
that
petitioner
suggests
as
somehow
analogous
to
agent's
commissions.
they're
really
not
analogous
to
agent's
commissions
at
all.
they
are
payments
that
are
made
directly
to
the
person
who
is
in
the
position
of
the
policyholder,
according
to
petitioner's
theory.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
was
designed,
justice
scalia,
to
cover
the
situation
when
the
initial
insurer
pays
money
over
to
a
second
insurance
company
to
obtain
indemnity
reinsurance.
it
covers
only
monies
that
flow
one
way.
and
the
reason
that
that
construction
is
appropriate
is
the
language
that
you
have
identified.
consideration
arising
out
of
reinsurance
ceded
appears
not
once,
but
twice,
within
the
same
section
809.
in
809(d)(7)
congress
used...
and
that
language
is
set
out
in
our
brief
at
the
appendix
on
page
2
and
1...
that
language
was
used
in
a
context
that
permits
no
other
reading
than
as
a
payment
that's
made
by
the
initial
insurer
to
a
second
company.
it's
our
position
that
when
congress
deliberately
uses
the
same
language
in
two
phrases
that
so
closely
enjoin
each
other
that
no
other
reading
is
really
appropriate
but
that
they
be
given
the
identical
meaning.
the
reason
that
it
becomes
clear
that
809(d)(7)--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
in
this
transaction
it
does
and
that's
we
say
that
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
doesn't,
for
example,
when
an
insurance
company
purchases
something
called
yearly
renewable
term
reinsurance,
which
is
much
like
what
everybody
thinks
of
as
an
insurance
contract.
the
policyholder
pays
money
to
the
insurance
company.
this
case
is
somewhat
unusual
in
that
it
involves
an
insurance
company
paying
money
to
someone
who
petitioner
says
is
the
insurance
policyholder.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
there
are
several
different
kinds
of
indemnity
reinsurance
that
all
fall
within
the
rubric
of
reinsurance
ceded.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
this
is
one
and
so
is
yearly
renewable
term.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
they're
under
the
second
clause,
justice
kennedy.
they're
not
return
premiums.
what
congress
had
in
mind
by
return
premiums
were
payments
that
were
made,
for
example,
when
a
policyholder
has
paid
a
premium
but
he
dies
before
the
coverage
has
fully
been
given
so
some
of
the
premium
is
paid
back
to
the
estate.
or,
the
policy
premium
was
incorrectly
calculated
in
the
first
place
so
that
there
is
a
rebate
paid
to
the
policyholder.
it's
those
sorts
of
figures
that
one
truly
would
never
look
at
as
income
to
the
insurance
company
in
the
first
place
had
they
not
been
mistakenly
paid.
when
they
are
paid
back,
they're
return
premiums
and
they're
used
as
a
vehicle
for
the
insurance
company
to
eliminate
that
amount
from
its
gross
income.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
justice--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
it
clearly
does
in
several
different
places.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
money
received--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no.
it
would
be
taxable
as
ordinary
income.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yeah.
there
is
no
capital
gain
provision
at
all
that's
applicable
for
insurance
policies.
they
were
deliberately
excluded
from
the
coverage
of
favorable
capital
gains
treatment.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it's
harder
to
say
how
the
question
would
have
come
out
had
congress
not
specifically
written
a
rule
that
prevented
these
sales
of
insurance
policies
from
being
treated
as
capital
gain,
but
it
did
that
to
avoid
the
favorable
effects
to
the
ceding
companies
in
these--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--between
the
assumption
transactions--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
one
difference
that
petitioner
has
made
much
of
is
the
provision
under
which
a
ceding
company
in
either
transaction
can
deduct
its
payments
to
the
reinsurer.
congress
provided
that
the
ceding
company
in
an
indemnity
transaction
deducts
them
under
809(c)(1)
and
in
an
assumption
transaction
it
deducts
them
under
809(d)(7),
i
believe.
there's
an
explanation
for
that
that
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
taxation
of
the
ceding
commission
with
respect
to
the
buying
company.
the
explanation
is
that
in
an
indemnity
reinsurance
situation
the
initial
insurer
essentially
serves
as
the
conduit
for
the
premiums.
he
continues
to
receive
premiums--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--pays
some
of
them
over
to
the
reinsurer,
and
so
he
uses
the
same
section
of
the
act
to
neutralize
the
effect
of
the
receipt
of
those
premiums.
an
assumption
reinsurer
doesn't
have
the
benefit
of
continued
receipt
of
premiums
so
it
needs
a
separate
section
or
it
wouldn't
be
able
to
deduct
the
premiums
that
it
pays
over
to
a
reinsurer
at
all.
and
the
other
sections
that
are
relied
on
by
petitioner
have
similar
explanations
that
have
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
ceding
commissions.
the
distinctive
feature
of--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
don't
think
so
as
to
return
premiums.
no,
your
honor.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
these
ceding
commissions
are
not
essentially
being
returned
to
the
initial
insurer
at
all.
they
are
an
up-front
agreed-upon
purchase
price
that
is
paid
over
at
the
outset
of
the
transaction
and
is
the
very
reason
why
the
transaction
happens.
it's
the
consideration
that's
paid
for
it.
so,
i
don't
think
that
it's
a
fair
reading
of
the
words
"return
premium"
to
say
that
it
fits
within
that
language.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
that
that
language
is
sufficiently
flexible
so
that
a
lot
of
different
readings
could
be
given
to
it.
had
not
congress
expressly
chosen
to
use
it
twice...
to
use
it
once
in
809(c)(1)
and
once
in
809(d)(7)...
and
in
the
first
context
it
may
have
some
ambiguity
as
to
who
can
avail
oneself
of
that
section.
but
in
809(d)(7)
it's
clear,
in
light
of
the
legislative
history,
that
congress
saw
that
as
a
section
for
initial
companies
to
deduct
payments
that
they
make--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes.
it's
in
the
appendix.
i
think
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
page
1(a),
and
carries
over
to
page
2.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
the
language--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
language
could
probably
have
been
written
better
by
congress
to
clarify
its
meaning,
but--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
they
clearly
meant
it
too
because
they
wrote
in
the
legislative
history
discussing
the
(d)(7)
section
in
absolutely
unmistakable
terms
that
it
refers
to
a
payment
from
an
initial
insurer
over
to
a
second
company.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
there's
several
points.
first
of
all,
the
treasury
department
never
wrote
this
section
having
any
indication
that
it
would
be
used
to
cover
ceding
commissions.
it
was
responding
to
a
very
different
and
a
very
specific
problem.
a
problem
that
actually
resulted
in
the
addition
of
the
second
sentence
of
809(c)(1)
to
that
section.
the
problem
there
is
a
fairly
intricate
one.
it
relates
to
the
distinction
between
dividends
and
return
premiums
for
purposes
of
deduction
under
this
aspect
of
the
life
insurance
company
tax
act.
congress
wanted
basically
to
make
clear
that
an
insurance
company
could
not
take
all
of
its
investment
earnings
and
redistribute
them
back
to
its
policyholders,
call
them
return
premiums
and
deduct
them
all
in
the
year
that
they
were
paid.
that
would
allow
insurance
companies
to
escape
taxation
on
that
investment
income,
which
congress
distinctly
wanted
not
to
be
the
case.
it
did,
however,
also
want
there
to
be
a
second
kind
of
payment
that
would
be
deductible.
and
that
kind
of
payment
was
known
as
an
experience
refund.
it
reflects...
it
occurs
only
in
contracts
between
one
insurance
company
and
another,
like
the
kind
that
we're
dealing
with
here.
and
that
kind
of
provision
allows
the
stream
of
premium
income
to
be
adjusted
if
the
parties
essentially
miscalculated
in
how
much
income
was
going
to
be
flowing
over
to
the
second
company.
and
it
adjusts
that
on
the
basis
of
experience.
now,
the
legislative
history
makes
clear
that
even
though
dividends
aren't
deductible
in
full,
these
kinds
of
experience
refunds
are
deductible.
and
it
deliberately
chose
to
put
language
in
the
statute
that
would
achieve
that
result.
and
that
language
is
copied
virtually
verbatim
into
the
regulation
that
you're
referring
to.
so,
i
think
that
read
in
light
of
the
history
of
the
problems
that
congress
had
in
mind
that
it
identified
and
the
specific
language
that
it
chose
to
solve
them,
it
would
be
misconstruing
the
statute
to
stretch
its
language
to
cover
a
kind
of
payment
that
was
never
intended
to
be
covered
by
it.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
justice
kennedy.
it
relied
on
the
return
premium
clause
and
on
the
secretary's
regulation.
it
relied
very
little
on
anything
else.
it
then
drew
a
sort
of
rough
analogy
between
agents'
commissions
that
are
initially
deductible
in
a
single
sale
or
an
insurance
policy
and
the
ceding
commissions
here.
it
didn't
subject
that
analogy
to
any
kind
of
rigorous
analysis.
it
never
seemed
to
be
bothered
by
the
fact
that
the
ceding
commission
goes
to
the
person
who
is
presumably
the
insurance
policyholder,
and
it
just
left
to
the
conclusion
that
these
are
currently
deductible.
we
think
that
it
would
draw
an
inappropriate
distinction
between
assumption
reinsurance
transactions
and
indemnity
reinsurance
transactions
to
allow
the
reinsurer
in
the
indemnity
field
to
have
an
immediate
deduction
where
the
assumption
reinsurer
does
not
get
an
immediate
deduction.
both
of
them
get
essentially
the
same
economic
benefits
and
economic
obligations
as
a
result
of
the
transaction.
and
both
of
them
pay
a
ceding
commission
in
order
to
acquire
those
benefits.
if
it's
capital
in
one
context,
it's
capital
in
the
other
context,
and
both
of
them
should
be
treated
the
same.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
true,
justice
stevens.
there
is
that
difference
in
the
form
of
the
transactions.
but
it
really
doesn't
have
a
lot
to
do
with
the
economic
benefits
that
the
reinsuring...
the
reinsurer
pays
for
it
when
he
pays
a
ceding
commission.
in
either
case
it's
paying
the
ceding
commission
so
that
it
can
get
a
stream
of
future
income
arising
out
of
a
block
of
policies.
for
example,
if
in
the
assumption
context
the
assuming
reinsurance
company
contracted
with
some
third
party
to
deal
with
the
policyholders...
and,
in
fact,
contracted
with
the
initial
insuring
company
and
said,
"look,
continue
as
a
manager
for
us
for
these
policies,
collect
the
premiums,
pay
them
to
us,
pay
the
benefits,
the
policyholders
never
have
to
know
about
this.
"
that
shouldn't
make
any
difference
to
the
tax
treatment
of
the
ceding
commission
because
in
both
cases
it
serves
to
create
an
identifiable
economic
benefit
for
the
second
insurance
company
that's
going
to
stretch
over
a
period
of
many
years.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
there
are
reasons
to
distinguish
between
them
based
on
the
fact
that
the
forms
of
the
transactions
do
have
some
differences.
but
congress
drew
those
distinctions
where
it
found
them
relevant
to
draw
them.
it
was
aware
of
the
two
kinds
of
insurance
contracts
and
it
crafted
various
provisions,
which
petitioner
cites,
that
draw
those
distinctions.
the
question
has
to
be
asked:
why
didn't
it
draw
one
here?
why
did
it
not
write
a
distinction
here?
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
congress
did
not
think
a
lot--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--about
ceding
commissions,
and
that
really
undermines
the
suggestion
that
the
broad
and
open-ended
language
of
809(c)(1)
be
read
to
cover
a
problem
that
congress
never
really
had
in
mind
when
it
clearly
had
other
problems
that
it
was
deliberately
writing
to
address.
the
final
provision
that
is
relied
on
by
petitioner
to
support
a
deduction
of
these
ceding
commissions
is
the
accounting
provisions
of
the
life
insurance
company
tax
act
that
were
addressed
by
this
court
in
the
standard
life
case.
i
think
the
most
basic
response
to
that
argument
is
that
this
really
isn't
an
accounting
question
at
all.
this
is
a
question
that
the
court
is
quite
familiar
with
and
has
seen
in
a
number
of
other
contexts
in
a
number
of
other
occasions.
it's
a
question
of
whether
a
payment
creates
a
capital,
intangible
asset
or
simply
represents
an
ordinary
business
expense.
and
that
kind
of
fundamental
classification
decision
is
one
that's
drawn
in
the
substantive
sections
of
the
code.
it's
not
something
that's
just
simply
given
over
to
the
accounting
sections.
if
petitioner's
position
were
correct,
then
the
naic
could
designate
any
kind
of
capital
outlay
as
an
immediately
deductible
expense.
and
it
might
have
good
reason
for
doing
it
for
naic
purposes.
it
might
feel
that
that
better
protects
the
solvency
of
the
company
for
purposes
of
protecting
the
insurance
policyholders.
but
there
would
be
no
reason
for
congress
to
have
wanted
to
abdicate
entirely
all
of
the
provisions
of
the
tax
code
to
the
way
the
naic
sets
up
its
books.
however,
if
this
court
does
view
the
question
in
this
case
as
having
something
to
do
with
section
818,
the
accounting
provisions,
then
there
is
a
body
of
federal
tax
accounting
doctrine
that
one
can
look
at
that
determines
that
a
payment
made
for
future
outlays
is
not
an
immediately
deductible
expense.
and
that
regulation,
which
is
regulation
1.461,
is
cited
in
our
brief
at
page
39.
petitioner
quoted
it;
i
won't
quote
it
again.
it
is
a
rule
that's
applicable
to
all
accrual
taxpayers.
it's
so
fundamental
a
tax
accounting
rule
that
the
secretary
also
made
it
applicable
to
cash
basis
taxpayers.
but
that
doesn't
undermine
the
fact
that
it
still
applies
to
taxpayers
in
the
accrual
system.
so,
we
do
not
think
that
818
provides
any
basis
for
the
deduction
of
these
ceding
commissions.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--this
would
be
a
payment
that
covers
years
for
which
premiums
have
not
yet
been--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--received?
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
would
think
that
it
would
have
to
treat
it
as
a
deferred
expense
and
not
deduct
it
all
in
the
year
in
which
it
paid
it.
it
can't...
nobody
can
accelerate
all
of
their
deductions
by
paying
them
all
at
once.
i
can't
pay
15
months
of
my
mortgage
in
this
year
and
deduct
them
all
on
my
current
tax
return.
and
that's
in
effect
what
this
would
be
doing.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
so,
that
i
do
not
think
would
be
a
permissible
result.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
i
think
so,
because
at
the
other
end
it's
simply
saying
that
the
ceding
commission
reflects
identifiable
benefits
over
many
years
so
it
has
to
be
allocated
to
the
years
in
which
the
benefit
is
produced.
thank
you.
