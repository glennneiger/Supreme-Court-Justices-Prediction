that's
not
unusual,
to
have
closed
areas
as
part
of
a
reservation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
it's
unusual
today,
but
at
least
historically
it
wouldn't
have
been
unusual.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
whole
reservation
was
closed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
now,
if
you
have
a
closed
area
today,
which
means
i
suppose
your
zoning
inspectors
have
no
right
to
go
into
the
area,
how
would
you
ever-enforce
your
zoning
laws?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
really
understand
that.
i
thought
there
was
a
closed
area.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
any
member
of
the
public
can
enter
the
closed
area
on
those
roads?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
is
no
closed
area
there
now.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
if
there's
a
big
area
that
a
big
portion
of
it
is
inaccessible
to
anyone
except
those
permitted
by
the
tribe
or
anyone
who
is
in
the
middle
of
a
public
road,
i
still
don't
understand
how
your
agents
can
enforce
zoning
ordinances
in
inaccessible
portions
of
the
closed
area.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
with
kind
of
a
basic
question
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
much
of
the
argument
has
been
devoted
to
language
in
the
montana
opinion
as
being
the
sole
test
for
deciding
the
case.
that
language
as
i
understand
it
dealt
with
the
question
whether
the
inherent
sovereignty
of
the
tribe
dictated
the
result
in
that
portion
of
the
case.
i'm
wondering
if
both
of
you
really
think
that
that's
the
only
issue,
is
the
inherent
sovereignty
issue,
or
is
it
possible
that
the
language
of
the
basic
treaty
or
some
act
of
congress
has
something
to
do
with
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
interrupt
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
you've
just
said
relates
to
a
question
that
justice
white
asked
earlier,
and
you
seem
to
be
describing
what
happens
here
as
sort
of
all
or
nothing
at
all,
either
the
tribe
has
jurisdiction
or
the
county
has
jurisdiction.
and
i
know
you
don't
like
montana
or
applying
the
test
of
montana,
but
i
read
the
second
exception
to
montana
as
not
speaking
in
that
fashion
when
it
says
"a
tribe
may
retain
inherent
power
to
exercise
civil
authority
over
the
conduct
of
non-indians
on
fee
lands
within
its
reservation
when
that
conduct
threatens
or
has
some
direct
effect
on.
"
i
don't
think
what
that
means
in
context
is
that,
since
any
activity
affected
by
zoning
would
affect
the
tribe,
the
tribe
must
have
total
jurisdiction
over
zoning.
i
think
it
meant,
should
zoning
be
permitted
by
the
county
in
such
a
way
that
the
particular
zoning
might
affect
the
tribe,
then
there
would
be
a
problem
and
the
tribe
might
have
some
jurisdiction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
do
agree
that
it's
sort
of
central
to
this
controversy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
three
incorporated
towns.
you
say
the
tribe,
if
it
chose
to
exercise,
could
exercise
zoning
authority
there.
is
it
your
view
they
could
exercise
exclusive
zoning
authority?
i
take
it
now--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
could.
now,
under
the
present
situation
is
it...
i
didn't
quite
catch
a
minute
ago...
the
county
or
the
incorporated
villages
that
exercise
zoning
power
now,
or
both?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
towns.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
