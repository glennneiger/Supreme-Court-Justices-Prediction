kennedy
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say:
"to
be
sure,
indian
tribes
retain
inherent
sovereign
power
to
exercise
some
forms
of
civil
jurisdiction
over
non-indians
on
their
reservations.
"
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
term
"closed
area"
is
just
a
term
that
came
up
in
this
case?
it's
not
defined
in
the
regulations?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
not
even
a
term
of
art
that
the
bia
uses,
i
take
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
anything
in
the
county
zoning
ordinances
which
require
the
zoning
authorities
to
respect
the
interests
of
the
tribe
as
such?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
that
duty
of
yours
to
protect
tribal
interests
enforceable
by
federal
law?
suppose
you
are
arbitrary
so
far
as
the
tribe
was
concerned.
they
alleged
that
you
were
not
protecting
their
interests.
does
that
create
a
federal
cause
of
action?
i
take
it
not.
it's
just
a
zoning
question.
the
tribe
just...
you
protect
the
tribe's
interests
just
like
you
protect
anybody
else's
interests.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
not
to
any
greater
extent
and
not
because
of
any
compulsion
of
federal
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oliphant
was
the
interpretation
of
a
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
there
were
would
the
landowner
have
the
right
to
test
it?
he's
not
a
member
of
the
tribe.
he
can't
vote
for
the
tribe.
there's
no
judicial
review.
am
i
right
about
all
those
things?
