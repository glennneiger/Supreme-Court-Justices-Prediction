mr.
tim
weaver
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court:
i'd
like
to...
i
represent
the
yakima
indian
nation,
the
other
half
of
this
controversy.
it's
an
unfortunate
fact
of
time
and
occurrence
that
we
ended
up
with
this
argument
about
the
closed
area
and
the
open
area.
mr.
sullivan
is
correct
in
saying
there
is
no
"closed
area".
there
is
a
reservation
reserved
area,
a
zoning
and
land
use
decision
made
by
the
yakima
indian
nation
to
deal
with
the
area
in
which
mr.
brendale
has
his
property.
mr.
tim
weaver
which
is...
well,
25,000
acres
out
of
740,000
acres,
approximately,
is
held
in
fee,
your
honor.
the
remainder
of
it
is
in
trust
land.
mr.
tim
weaver
i
think
that
we
can
clear
up
a
little
bit
of
the
problem
very
quickly
with
regard
to
the
brendale
property.
what
we're
talking
about
here,
i
think
all
the
justices
have
recognized,
is
the
police
power
function
of
the
sovereign,
which
there's
no
question
the
yakima
nation
is
a
sovereign.
mr.
sullivan
in
his
argument
to
the
district
court
in
the
whiteside
ii
case,
the
open
area
case,
advised
the
court
in
regard
to
the
brendale
issue:
"we
couldn't
present
any
testimony
about
the
services
we
provide.
"
"they
don't
exist.
"
"the
real
interest
out
there
in
the
closed
area
does
belong
to
the
yakima
indian
nation,
we
agree.
"
the
county
didn't
appeal
to
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
brendale
case.
i
can
only
assume
that
the
county
had
decided
that
what
their
counsel
had
advised
the
district
court
was
correct.
mr.
tim
weaver
mr.
brendale--
mr.
tim
weaver
--right,
yes,
mr.
brendale
appealed.
mr.
brendale
filed
the
petition
in
this
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
his
counsel
is
not
here
today.
that
matter
is
being
now
argued
by
the
county.
i
think
that
the
question
with
regard
to
the
reservation
reserved
area
is
very
clear.
under
whatever
test
the
court
wishes
to
discuss,
it's
clear
that
the
yakima
indian
nation
has
retained
jurisdiction
to
zone
all
lands
within
that
area.
mr.
sullivan
raises
the
question
of
the
inability
of
mr.
brendale
to
have
an
impact.
i
believe
that
the
same
is
exactly
true
of
mr.
brendale's
situation,
the
situation
that
mr.
sullivan
wishes
to
put
my
client
in,
and
that
is
that
the
tribal
zoning
process
is
an
open
process.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
zoning
code
we
enacted
in
1972
almost
mirrors
the
county's
zoning
ordinance.
mr.
tim
weaver
i'm
not
certain
that
i--
mr.
tim
weaver
--that's
correct.
mr.
tim
weaver
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
question
in
the
closed
area
is,
quite
frankly--
mr.
tim
weaver
--on
the
reservation,
the
reservation
reserved
area.
no,
i
didn't
tell
you
that,
your
honor.
that's
mr.
sullivan.
mr.
tim
weaver
in
the
reservation
reserved
area,
that
the
interest
of
the
county
simply
isn't
there.
they
admit
that
they
don't
have
a
police
power
interest
in
that
area
in
which
the
court
ought
to
recognize
them
being
able
to
now
assert
that
interest
there.
i
think
that
the
record
is
clear.
they've
admitted
it
and
they
haven't
appealed.
mr.
tim
weaver
yes,
i
believe
it
is
before
you,
your
honor.
i
think
that
where
the
sovereign,
however,
who
claims
the
authority
at
the
trial
of
the
case
disclaims
any
interest,
they
have
a
difficult
time
reasserting
it
at
this
level.
mr.
tim
weaver
i
don't--
mr.
tim
weaver
--oh,
yes,
i
believe
that's
true,
your
honor.
and
under
the
yakima
nation
zoning
code
that
citizen
does
have
the
opportunity
to
use
his
property
in
a
reasonable
manner.
we
have
not...
there's
no
allegation
before
this
court
of
any
confiscatory
zoning,
of
any
arbitrary
and
capricious
action
in
either
of
these
cases
on
behalf
of
the
yakima
nation.
mr.
tim
weaver
he's
certainly
not
a
member
of
the
tribe
and
can't
vote.
i
think
this
court
has
dealt
with
that
issue,
however,
justice
kennedy,
in
other
cases.
for
instance,
in
the
mazurie
case
that
issue
was
specifically
brought
forth
and
discussed
as
an
issue
in
which
the
fact
that
the
fee
land
owner
on
the
reservation
couldn't
vote
was
not
a
determination
in
the
issue.
and
i
think
that--
mr.
tim
weaver
--well,
under
the
tribal
zoning
authority,
justice
o'connor,
they
would
first
of
all
go
to
the
zoning
administrator.
they
then
would
go
to
the
board
of
adjustment.
and
the
final
step
would
be
to
the
tribal
council.
it
is
correct
that
under
the
current
tribal
zoning
code
there
is
not
direct
judicial
review.
i
caution
the
court,
however,
that
issue
is
not
here
before
you,
and
the--
mr.
tim
weaver
--well,
yes,
i
believe
that
under--
mr.
tim
weaver
--well,
yes,
in
a
manner
of
speaking,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
of
course,
under
the
tribal
zoning
code
and
under
a
decision
made
in
the
tribe's
sovereign
power,
they
have
chosen
not
to
assert
that
authority
within
the
cities.
i
think
that's
an
issue
that
needs
to
be
discussed
on
a
reasonableness
basis.
mr.
tim
weaver
well,
of
course--
mr.
tim
weaver
--well,
that
may
be
what
the
issue
is
that
he
has
presented,
your
honor.
that
certainly
was
not
an
issue
that
was
presented
and
tried
to
the
district
court.
the
question,
of
course,
is
that
these
lands,
there
are
many
of
these
lands
that
are
zoned,
for
instance,
by
the
county
that
are
agricultural
lands
that
are
either
to
some
degree
or
totally
within
that
same
category.
for
him
to
come
before
you
and
say
that
every
single
situation
where
there's
an
agricultural
land
under
the
county
zoning
ordinances
is
not
correct,
either.
i
think
in
looking
at
what
mr.
sullivan
asks
this
court
to
do,
your
honors,
i
heard
him
say
that
now
under
the
rule
in
montana
that
the
county
starts
with
the
position
that
it
has
jurisdiction
and
that
the
tribe
must
come
before
the
court
and
prove
its
interest.
i
find
nothing
in
any
of
the
briefs...
and
there
are
a
lot
of
them
filed
here,
as
you
know...
that
supports
that
position.
i
find
nothing
in
any
act
of
congress
or
in
the
treaty
with
the
yakimas,
that
your
honors
must
construe
in
looking
at
this
issue,
that
makes
that
determination.
mr.
tim
weaver
certainly.
mr.
tim
weaver
thank
you,
your
honor.
yes,
that
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
going
to
be
my
next
point.
i
think
that
the
test
in
montana,
which
mr.
sullivan
now
says
is
the
sole
test
upon
which
this
court
should
test
indian
sovereignty,
simply
is
not
the
case,
particularly
with
regard
to
the
differences
between
the
yakima
treaty
and
the
treaty
in
the
crow
case,
and
with
the
decisions
of
this
court
discussing
the
yakima
treaty.
the
yakima
treaty
has
been
here
five
times,
your
honor
the
winans
case,
the
suford
case,
the
washington
passenger
fishing
vessel
case,
the
colville
case,
and
the
yakima
indian
nation
versus
washington.
in
every
single
one
of
those
cases,
this
court
has
held...
and
i
refer
you
specifically
to
winans
since
it
was
a
case
determined
during
the
allotment
era,
when,
as
the
county
alleges,
the
intent
of
congress
was
to
totally
deprive
indians
of
all
vestiges
of
sovereignty.
in
1905
this
court
held
in
the
winans
case
that
the
yakima
treaty
was
a
true
treaty
of
what
we
call
cession,
all
rights
reserved
that
weren't
ceded
to
the
government
of
the
united
states.
that
is
important
because
when
you
look
at
the
provisions
of
the
yakima
treaty,
specifically
article
1,
the
yakima
nation
ceded
to
the
united
states
government
in
1855
the
lands
to
which
it
claimed
and
occupied.
when
you
look,
when
you
read
the
crow
treaty,
for
instance,
the
treaty
you
were
construing
in
montana,
the
crows
simply
gave
up
all
right
and
claim
that
they
had
to
the
lands
of
the
united
states.
mr.
tim
weaver
first
of
all,
the
language
of
cession,
that
the
yakima
nation
ceded
its
own
lands.
mr.
tim
weaver
okay,
the
next
issue
is
in
article
2
of
the
yakima
treaty,
your
honor,
that
says...
that
reserved
from
those
lands
that
the
yakima
nation
owned,
to
which
they
had
title,
which
is
recognized
specifically
in
the
treaty,
they
reserved
the
lands
which
constitute
the
present
yakima
nation
boundary
for
the
exclusive
use
and
benefit
of
their
membership.
now,
you
discussed
the
exclusive
use
and
membership
language
or
similar
language
in
the
crow
treaty.
however,
it's
not
tied
to
that
other
specific
treaty
language.
there
is
no
specific
language
of
reservation
in
the
crow
treaty.
mr.
tim
weaver
and
i
think
that
the
last
point
that
i'd
like
to
make
before
i
discuss
that
issue
is
the
specific
guarantees,
the
specific
discussion
between
the
yakima
leaders
at
the
treaty
grounds
in
1855
and
governor
stevens,
that
the
yakima
nation
would
have
their
own
government,
would
have
their
own
laws,
that
they
would
be
provided
with
an
area
where
the
white
man
would
not
enter.
the
allotment
act
issue--
mr.
tim
weaver
--well,
i
believe
that
i
would
have
to
say,
your
honor,
that
the
allotment
act,
when
you
start
trying
to
figure
out
what
was
happening...
i
think
there
were
20
briefs
before
the
court
and
each
one
of
them
says
something
different.
but
i
would--
mr.
tim
weaver
--i
would
certainly
agree
that
under
the
general
allotment
act
of
1987...
and
of
course,
that's
another
point;
the
court
has
to
look
at
all
these
acts,
and
the
act
specifically
dealing
with
yakima
and
its
construction...
that
there
was
an
intent
of
congress
at
the
very
least
to
pass
communal
ownership
of
tribal
lands
into
non...
or
into
indian
hands,
through
the
allotment
act,
and
to
provide
those
indians
with
a
piece
of
property
under
their
ownership.
i
think
also
it's
hard
to
deny
that
congress
intended
that
some
or
a
good
portion
of
those
lands
would
pass
out
of
indian
ownership.
i
think
there
are
also
acts
that
allowed
non-indians
to
move
onto
reservations
and
own
lands
that
weren't
allotted.
the
court's
dealt
with
that
situation
in
its
recent
decision
in
solem
versus
barnett,
in
which
it
held
that
acts
of
that
type
shouldn't
be
construed
as
a
divestment
of
tribal
sovereignty
or
tribal
boundaries
and
government
over
lands
of
that
type
unless
there
is
clear
evidence
of
specific
intent,
unambiguous
intent
of
congress
that
such
a
divestiture
was
intended.
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
i
think
in
the
first
couple
of
pages,
some
discussion
of
congressional
sentiment...
i'm
not
sure
whether
you
can
call
it
congressional
intent...
that
speaks
of
the
background
of
the
1905
surplus
lands
act
at
yakima,
that
says
these
indians
haven't
consented,
these
indians
are
causing
us
problems,
we
need
to
open
these
lands
to
non-indian
settlers.
at
first
blush
you
look
at
that
and
you
think,
my
goodness,
that
language
clearly
indicates
that
congress
was
taking
something
away.
the
reason
that
we
cite
that
language,
the
reason
that
we
cite
it,
is
that
when
you
look
at
these
acts
and
when
you
look
at
what
congress
intended,
it's
important
that
you
look
specifically
at
the
act
and
you
also
specifically
look
at
what
congress
knew
at
the
time
they
passed
those
acts.
if
you
look
at,
for
instance,
the
surplus
lands
act,
it
doesn't
say
anything
in
that
act
that
we
are
divesting
the
indians
of
any
jurisdiction
over
these
lands
within
their
boundaries.
it
doesn't
say
anything
as
to
the
effect,
for
instance,
of
a
potential
diminishment
of
the
reservation.
congress
clearly
knew
at
the
time
they
passed
that
act,
for
instance...
it
was
contemporaneous
with
this
court's
decision
in
winans
which
reserved
all
rights
to
the
yakima
nation
not
granted
in
the
treaty.
it
was
with
clear
knowledge
of
this
court's
rulings
going
clear
back
to
worcester
versus
georgia
giving
tribal
governments
the
right
to
be
governed
by
their
own
laws
and
to
govern
their
own
territory.
mr.
tim
weaver
well,
i
think
that
once--
mr.
tim
weaver
--well
no,
certainly
i
think
that
the
question
of
course
of
jurisdiction
in
the
tribal
courts,
for
what
purpose?
your
honor,
i
think
that
this
court
clearly
has
held
in
two
very
recent
cases,
the
iowa
mutual
case...
and
i've
suddenly
drawn
a
blank
on
the
second
case,
but
have
held
that,
with
regard
to
civil
jurisdiction
matters
in
tribal
court,
that's
clearly
an
area
within
the
retained
sovereignty
of
an
indian
tribe,
at
least
to
test
their
jurisdiction.
mr.
sullivan
tells
you
that
we
want
you
to
overrule
the
oliphant
case.
i
don't
believe
in
my
brief,
unless
i'm
mistaken,
that
we
ask
you
to
do
that.
i
think
that
the
oliphant
case
is
consistent
with
the
position
taken
by
the
yakima
nation.
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
oliphant
case
that
says
that
indian
tribes
didn't
reserve
all
rights
granted
to
them.
what
you
said
in
oliphant
was
that
you
found
an
overriding
and
compelling
federal
interest
that
had
continued
virtually
since
treaty
time
that
simply
overrode
the
powers
of
tribes
to
try
non-indians
for
crimes
committed
on
their
reservation.
i
think
in
that
regard,
justice
scalia,
the
yakima
treaty
probably
deals
with
that
issue.
it
discusses
the
requirement
that
the
yakima
tribe
relinquish
to
the
united
states
offenders
against
its
laws.
i
think
the
important
thing
to
remember
with
regard
to
the
issue,
for
instance,
the
oliphant
issue
versus
the
issue
of
land
use
planning,
we're
talking
here
about
land
use
planning,
zoning.
what
happens
on
this
piece
of
property
directly
affects
what
happens
on
the
next
piece
of
property.
if
someone
wants
to
build
a
garbage
dump
next
to
your
house,
it's
pretty
damn
difficult
for
you
to
say
to
the
zoning
authority:
gee,
you
ought
to
just
stick
on
that
piece
of
property
and
not
let
that
use
override
onto
my
property.
mr.
tim
weaver
yes,
there
are
some
findings,
and
i
appreciate
you
asking
me
that
question
because
i
think
there's
a
misperception.
mr.
tim
weaver
no,
i
don't
believe
you
do,
and
i'll
explain,
justice
o'connor.
there's
a
misperception
here
as
to
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
with
regard
to
the
findings.
first
of
all,
we
challenged
those
findings
in
the
appeal
process.
the
ninth
circuit
reviewed
those
findings
on
a
clearly
erroneous
distinction
and,
while
their
opinion
doesn't
simply
say
we
hereby
determine
that
these
findings
were
clearly
erroneous,
what
they
say
is:
we
reviewed
the
findings
on
a
clearly
erroneous
basis;
we
find
that
there
was
evidence...
and
this
is
another
distinction.
the
district
court
didn't
find,
for
instance,
that...
or
at
least
the
reversal
wasn't
based
on
a
fact
that,
for
instance,
the
sewage
from
dr.
whiteside's
property
would
not
pollute
antanum
creek.
the
court
didn't
come
in
and
say,
oh,
we
disagree
with
that.
the
finding
that
they
discussed
was
a
finding
of
no
evidence,
a
totally
different
standard,
i
believe,
on
which
the
circuit
could
review.
the
circuit
said,
we
find
it
clearly
erroneous
that
the
tribe
presented
no
such
evidence.
i
think
when
you
look
in
our
brief
at
page
31
and
also
at
pages
6
and
7
you'll
find
the
evidence
that
the
tribe
presented.
you
don't
need
to
reach
that
issue,
however,
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
believe.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
has
done
violence
to
rule
52(b),
because
the
ninth
circuit
determined
as
a
matter
of
threshold
law,
on
the
same
basis
that
this
court
ruled
as
far
back
as
1926
in
the
euclid
case
that
zoning,
unlike
hunting
and
fishing
by
non-indians
on
their
property
on
the
crow
reservation,
that
zoning
per
se
is
a
threat
to
the
political
integrity,
health,
welfare,
and
societal
well-being
and
economic
well-being
of
the
yakima
indian
people.
they
determined
that
judge
quackerbush
improperly
determined
as
a
matter
of
the
first
instance
legally
that
we
had
not
fulfilled
the
test
in
montana.
i
think
that's
another
interesting--
mr.
tim
weaver
--sure.
mr.
tim
weaver
well,
of
course
i
certainly
don't
agree
with
that
analysis,
and
it's
based
on
the
reserved
rights
doctrine
of
the
tribe.
mr.
tim
weaver
well,
yes,
and
i
think
it
presents
an
interesting
dilemma,
not
only
for
the
tribes
but
for
the
counties,
because
the
next
time
the
county
makes
a
determination
to
put
in
an
80-person
subdivision,
then
suddenly,
rather
than
the
40
people
living
in
this
immediate
area,
you
have
120.
at
some
point
under
those
circumstances,
if
that
continues,
you're
going
to
have
a
situation
that
directly
affects
and
that
the
tribe
does
have
a
protectable
interest.
i
don't
believe
by
making
that
statement,
however,
that
the
ninth
circuit
misperceived
either
the
rule
in
this
case
or
in
montana.
i
don't
believe,
your
honor,
of
course,
that
montana
is
controlling
in
this
case.
i
believe
that
the
yakima
nation
has
retained
its
authority
over
all
the
entire
reservation
to
govern
its
own
people
and
its
own
population.
that's
not
a
unique
theory.
mr.
tim
weaver
yes,
in
which
they
have
a
legitimate
police
power
interest.
yes,
that's
correct,
because--
mr.
tim
weaver
--certainly.
mr.
tim
weaver
they
do.
mr.
tim
weaver
yes.
mr.
tim
weaver
yes.
i
think
if
i
were
here
today
with
a
case
where
mr.
sullivan
was
representing
the
mayor
of
toppenish
and
he
represented
to
you
that
toppenish
was
100
percent
fee
land,
that
it
was
land-locked,
as
it
is,
it
cannot
affect...
the
expansion
of
the
city
of
toppenish
cannot
affect
the
agrarian,
agricultural
interests
that
the
tribe
is
trying
to
protect,
that
i
would
have
a
difficult
time
convincing
you
that
the
police
power
interests
of
the
tribe
should
extend
into--
mr.
tim
weaver
--i'm
not
certain
that
i
follow
exactly
your
analysis.
mr.
tim
weaver
within
the
city?
mr.
tim
weaver
well,
the
cities
are
zoning.
mr.
tim
weaver
yes,
i
believe
that's
correct.
i
believe
that's
correct.
one
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
in
conclusion
is
that
you
should
not
ignore
the
statement
in
montana
that
the
exercise
of
tribal
government
beyond
what
is
necessary
to
protect
tribal
self-government
is
not
retained.
that's
the
issue
in
this
case.
the
power
to
zone,
the
power
to
control
the
homeland
which
was
guaranteed
to
the
tribes
by
the
united
states
government
in
their
treaties,
is
inherent,
is
so
inherent
in
that
power
to
self-govern,
that
to
take
that
away
you're
going
to
end
up
with
the
inability
of
the
tribe
to
protect
its
homeland,
its
agrarian
homeland.
mr.
tim
weaver
i
believe
under
the
reserved
powers
doctrine,
your
honor.
mr.
tim
weaver
in
the
towns?
mr.
tim
weaver
it's
the
towns
who
exercise
that
authority,
not
the
county.
mr.
tim
weaver
in
conclusion,
i
believe
that
the
court
can
uphold
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
in
both
of
these
cases.
clearly,
in
the
brendale
closed
area
case,
under
whatever
test
your
honors
apply,
i
believe
you
find
that
the
yakima
nation
has
retained
its
right
to
zone
in
that
area.
i
think,
as
i
said,
it's
an
unfortunate
circumstance
in
the
way
these
cases
were
tried
that
they
didn't
both
come
to
the
court
on
the
same
basis,
because
the
interests
of
the
yakima
nation
are
no
less
compelling
in
the
open
area
than
they
are
in
the
closed
area.
the
closed...
you
need
to
remember
that
the
yakima
nation
owns
over
50
percent
of
the
land
in
trust
in
the
closed
area.
it
has
a
greater
interest
physically.
it's
where
the
most
governance
is
needed.
it's
the
agricultural
land
base
of
the
tribe
from
which
it
derives
$5
million
a
year
income
from
the
agriculture,
in
which
it
owns
more
of
that
agricultural
land
than
non-indians.
it's
where
most
of
the
people
reside.
now,
the
people
situation
is
in
fact
in
the
area
where
the
tribe
is
governing,
it's
not
25,000/5,
000,
as
mr.
sullivan
stated.
10,000
of
those
people
live...
excuse
we,
20,000
and
5,000.
instead,
in
the
open
area
it's
10,000
people
outside
the
towns
and
5,000
indians,
if
that
in
effect
somehow
tips
the
balance.
i
don't
believe
it
does.
but
there
is
not
the
inequities
that
they
point
out.
the
tribe
has
a
real
and
legitimate
interest
in
protect
ion
of
this
area.
mr.
chief
justice,
my
time
has
expired.
