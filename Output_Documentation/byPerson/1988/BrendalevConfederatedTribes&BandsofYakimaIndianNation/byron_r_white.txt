so
what
about
the
other
exception?
justice
byron
r.
white
binding
on
us,
too,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
are
on
the
court
of
appeals,
or
to
the
extent
that
they
are
binding.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
challenging...
you're
challenging
the
result
below
in
both
cases,
aren't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
saying...
i
thought
you
thought
that
the
district
court
was
proceeding
under
the
right
rule,
but
apparently
not
you
say
he
sought
some
balancing
test
rather
than
the
montana
exception,
is
that
what
it
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
reason
was
to
protect
the
resources
in
that
closed
area,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
can
only
go
on
the
roads.
you
can't
get
off
and
build
fires
or
camp
or
fish
or
anything
like
that.
but
you
can't
do
that
if
you're
driving
on
the
lincoln
highway.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you
can
only
go
on
his
land.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
county
only
wants
to
reach
that
part
of
the
closed
area
that
is
in
private
ownership
in
fee.
justice
byron
r.
white
by
a
non-member.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
going
to
argue
the
easier
case,
too,
pretty
quick?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
i
understand
them,
they
say
that
you
have
no
power
at
all
to
zone,
and
that
it
should
be
the
tribe
that
zones.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
just
not
a
claim
that
this
is
an
improvident
zoning
decision,
that
ought
to
be
reworked
by
the
county.
it's
says
that
they
don't
have
any
authority
at
all
to
zone.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
long...
all
right,
go
ahead.
excuse
me.
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
quite
a
bit
of
difference,
it
seems
to
me,
between
saying
that
it's
the
yakima
tribe's
zoning
law
that's
going
to
apply
to
mr.
brendale's
property
and
saying
that
the
county
zoning
law
is
being
exercised
in
a
way
inconsistent
with
montana.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
the
county
zoning
law
had
come
out
the
other
way,
that
it
had
said
to
mr.
brendale,
in
view
of
what
the
surrounding
property
is
used
for,
we
are
not
going
to
allow
you
to
develop
that
piece
of
land.
now,
you
would
still
be
saying
it's
none
of
your
business,
this
is
the
yakima
zoning
law
that
should
apply.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
quite
a
different
approach
than
what
you
would
assume
would
rule
what
the
county
can
do
under
montana.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
isn't
any
closed
area
any
more,
you
told
me.
justice
byron
r.
white
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you're
saying
that
they
have
the
power
to
zone
any
property,
whoever
owns
it,
inside
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
then
comes
allotments.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
right,
absolutely
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
saying
they
have
retained
the
authority
to
control
the
use
of
property
anywhere
within
the
reservation
boundaries.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
they
have
a
legitimate--
justice
byron
r.
white
--police
power
interest.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it's
not
just
whenever,
it's
everywhere
within
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation.
justice
byron
r.
white
including
the
cities
and
towns.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
just
wouldn't...
if
you
lost
here,
you
just
couldn't
zone.
but
i
don't
know
why
you
would
say
the
result
is
then
that
the
county
can
do
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
you
lost
that
case.
could
anybody
zone?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
county
couldn't
do
it.
the
county
couldn't.
