justice
antonin
scalia
both
the
open
and
closed
portions?
justice
antonin
scalia
explain
to
a
non-westerner
what
this
distinction
is
between
open
and
closed
portions?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
concerned
about
its
territory.
i'm
concerned
what
does
it
mean
to
be
closed
and
what
does
it
mean
to
be
not
closed,
and
what
causes
it
to
be
closed
or
not
closed?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
how
under
whatever
test
you
want
to
apply,
how
can
that
decision
by
the
bia
subject
a
non-indian
who
has
a
fee
interest
in
a
portion,
that
the
bia
comes
in
and
says,
sorry,
your
fee
interest
is
now
in
a
closed
portion?
why
should
that
alter
whatever
test
we
apply?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
doesn't
matter
if
i'm
a
non-westerner
at
all.
[laughter]
and
here
i
thought
i
was
the
only
one
who
didn't--
--a
non-yakima.
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
this,
because
if
you
went
back
to
the
early
days
of
some
of
the
reservations,
didn't
the
tribes
have
the
complete
power
to
exclude
non-indians?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
your
answer
would
be
that
if
indeed
you're
correct
that
the
county
has
jurisdiction,
it
would
be
arbitrary
and
capricious
for
the
bia
to
close
the
roads
to
the
county
zoning
inspectors.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
couldn't
be
closed
for
that
purpose,
i
assume,
if
you're
right
about
the
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
sullivan,
you
know,
you
picked
the
absolute
worst
example
of
county
regulation
to
make
this
argument
for.
the
fact
is
that,
unlike
a
sales
tax,
which
is
collected
at
one
point,
zoning
by
its
nature,
that
the
decisions
are
made
on
the
basis
of
the
entire
surrounding
area.
so
it
just
seems
wierd
to
say
that
the
county
has
jurisdiction
to
zone
one
little
parcel
that's
in
the
middle,
totally
surrounded
by
indian-owned
land
or
trust
lands,
and
say
that
it's
the
county
that
should
have
the
right
to
determine
whether
doing
something
on
that
isolated
parcel
is
going
to
affect
the
surrounding
land.
it
seems
to
me
the
people
that
have
the
interest
in
zoning
there
are
the
people
who
own
the
surrounding
land.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
say
they
have
no
interest?
i
don't
know
that
the
county
doesn't
have
an
interest
that
its
county
citizens
should,
those
subject
to
its
jurisdiction,
should
be
able
to
use
their
property
in
a
reasonable
manner.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
may
not
have
any
interest
in
limiting
his
use
of
the
property,
but
they
certainly
have
an
interest
in
his
being
able
to
use
it
reasonably.
he's
one
of
their
citizens
subject
to
their
jurisdiction.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
weaver,
i
don't
think
you're
accurate,
by
the
way,
that
there's
been
no
assertion
of
confiscatory
zoning.
i
think
mr.
sullivan
just
said
that
one
of
these
parcels
was
zoned
agricultural
when
there
is
no
water
for
it.
i
think
i
heard
him
say
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
his
complaint
was
that
it
was
confiscatory,
precisely
what
you're
saying
is
not
at
issue
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
immediately
violated
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
suggest
that
the
settlers
in
their
dealings
with
non-indians
on
the
sovereign
would
be
subject
to
the
tribal
courts,
are
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
say
no
to
that,
then
you've
given
up
the
principle.
