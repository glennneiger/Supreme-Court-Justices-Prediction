mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
yakima
county
is
the
second
largest
county
in
the
state
of
washington.
the
yakima
indian
reservation
consists
of--
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
--geographically.
there's
approximately
180,000
people
in
yakima
county.
25,000
reside
on
the
reservation.
5,000
of
those
are
indians
and
20,000
are
non-indians.
the
reservation
itself
consists
of
approximately
1.3
million
acres,
80
percent
of
which
is
owned
in
trust,
20
percent
is
owned
by
non-indians
in
fee
simple,
or
approximately
260,000
acres.
there
are
10,467
separate
parcels
of
deeded
land
on
the
reservation,
500
miles
of
roads;
county
roads,
there's
a
state
highway
and
a
lot
of
bia
roads.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
the
scope
of
regulatory
control,
civil
regulatory
control,
that
a
tribe
can
exercise
over
non-members
on
deeded
land.
at
the
heart
of
this
case
is
the
tension
that's
created
by
two
sets
of
promises
made
by
congress.
on
the
one
hand,
you
have
the
promise
that
congress
made
to
the
indians
through
the
treaties.
on
the
other
hand,
you
have
the
promise
that
congress
made
to
the
citizens
whom
they
invited
onto
those
lands
through
the
general
allotment
act.
we
believe
this
case
involves
the
application
of
this
court's
ruling
in
montana
versus
united
states.
in
montana,
the
court
was
called
upon
to
determine
the
extent
of
power
that
the
tribe
still
retained
in
the
area
of
civil
regulation.
in
that
case
we
were
dealing
with
the
hunting
and
fishing
rights
of
those
non-members
on
deeded
land.
this
court,
in
examining
the
prior
opinions
of
the
court,
including
wheeler
and
oliphant,
determined
first
that
the
exclusive
use
and
benefit
language
of
the
crow
treaty
did
not
give
them
the
right
to
control
those
non-members.
they
did
not
have
the
inherent
right,
nor
did
they
have
the
treaty
right.
the
court
recognized
that,
oliphant,
the
intent
of
congress,
that
the
inherent
right
had
been
removed,
particularly
with
respect
to
the
non-indian...
removed
from
the
tribe,
this
inherent
power
with
respect
to
non-indians
on
their
own
land.
we
submit
that
montana
actually,
however,
did
establish
a
bright
line
test,
the
bright
line
test
that
we
are
asking
this
court
to
impose.
the
court
said--
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
--well,
because
the
ninth
circuit,
we
submit,
did
not
read
it
correctly.
and
in
fact,
the
court
misperceived
it
dramatically.
the
court
said,
meaning
the
ninth
circuit,
that
in
fact
the
treaty
provided
those
rights
and
that
the
tribe
had
inherent
rights,
and
then
went
on
to
rule
that...
adopt
a
per
se
rule
of
jurisdiction
for
tribes
based
upon
its
reading
of
montana.
the
court
said...
i
mean,
the
montana
language
is:
"though
oliphant
only
determined
the
inherent
tribal
authority
in
criminal
matters,
the
principles
on
which
it
relied
support
the
general
proposition
that
the
inherent
sovereign
powers
of
an
indian
tribe
do
not
extend
to
the
activities
of
non-members
of
the
tribe.
"
that's
the
rule.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
which
is
the
first
exception,
the
first
exception,
because
you
go
on
with
that
language,
which
then
goes
on
to
distinguish,
putting
in
consent
relationships,
talks
specifically
about
business
dealings,
contracts
and
leases.
we
have
no
objection
to
that
language.
we
agree.
it's
the
kind
of
language,
it's
the
kind
of
situation--
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
--the
second
exception
is
where
we
believe
the
problem
exists.
the
court,
in
establishing
the
second
exception,
did
two
things.
one,
it
says
"a
tribe
may
also
retain",
which
is
a
question
as
to
whether
in
fact
they
retain
any
inherent
power
at
all.
we
believe
that
in
fact
this
second
exception
needs
to
be
narrowed,
it
needs
to
be
clarified,
or
it
needs
to
be
eliminated.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
i
will,
your
honor.
the
second
exception
says:
"a
tribe
may
also
retain
inherent
power
to
exercise
civil
authority
over
the
conduct
of
non-indians
on
fee
lands
within
the
reservation
when
that
conduct
threatens
or
has
some
direct
effect
upon
the
political
integrity,
economic
security,
or
health
and
welfare
of
the
tribe.
"
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
yes,
they
did.
not
only
did
they
disregard
the
first
part
of
the
test
and
granted,
in
our
view,
the
inherent
power
in
the
treaty
power,
but
then
read
this
exception
so
that
it
swallowed
the
rule.
we
submit
that
if
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
is
allowed
to
stand,
any
properly
drawn
ordinance
passed
by
an
indian
nation
would
in
fact
confer
civil
regulatory
control.
the
broad
reading--
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
--the
district
court
made
two
completely
opposite
set
of
findings.
with
respect
to
mr.
brendale's
property,
which
was
then
located
in
what
we
call
the
closed
area
of
the
reservation...
and
our
position
is
is
that
that's
an
entirely
different
situation
now
because
the
closure
no
longer
exists.
there
is
the
letter
from
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
solicitor
that's
attached,
or
assistant
administrator,
that's
attached
to
the
appendix,
is
an
appendix
in
mr.
brendale's
brief,
in
which
now
that
area
is
open.
but
with
respect
to
that,
the
court
made
specific
findings
of
fact
that,
with
reference
to
mr.
brendale's
property,
attempting
to
apply,
i
think,
the
montana
exception,
and
found
that
it
would
have
an
impact
and
therefore
the
tribe
should
exercise
jurisdiction
in
that
area.
with
respect
to
mr.
wilkinson's
property,
which
is...
wilkinson's
property,
which
is
in
a
completely
different
area
of
the
reservation,
on
the
northern
boundary
four
miles
from
the
city
of--
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
--it's
in
the
open
area,
that's
correct.
there
the
court
made
specific
findings
that
not
only
would
this
development
have
no
impact,
none,
using
its
language,
"on
the
tribe
or
its
ability
to
govern
itself,
its
economic
security,
or
its
health
and
welfare.
"
the
court...
and
those
findings,
interestingly,
in
both
cases
were
left
undisturbed
by
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
yes,
they
are
fact
findings.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
i
think
they
are
fact
findings
that
are
binding
unless
they're
clearly
erroneous
or
not
supported
by
the
evidence.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
i
think
they
are
binding
on
you.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
to
the
extent
that
they're
binding,
unless
they're,
again,
clearly
erroneous
and
not
supported
by
the
evidence.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
no.
well,
as
far
as
the
ninth
circuit
is
concerned,
yes,
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
should
be
reversed.
i
think
that
the
trial
court
should
be
reversed
with
respect
to
mr.
brendale's
property
out
in
the
closed
area.
the
reason
that
we
believe
the
trial
court
should
be
reversed
out
in
the
closed
area,
we
agree
with
the
findings,
but
we
don't
agree
with
his
conclusion
of
law.
judge
quackenbush
in
making
that
decision
was
concerned,
we
believe,
about
the
wrong
part
of
the
test.
judge
quackenbush
was
concerned
about
a
balancing
test
similar
to
the
test
used
in
mescalero
apache
versus
new
mexico,
and
specifically
referred
to
that
in
questions
to
me,
saying:
you
know,
don't
i
have
to
balance
this;
and
what's
the
state
interest,
the
federal
interest,
the
county
interest
in
this
property?
our
position
is
that
that
isn't
the
rule
in
montana.
the
rule
in
montana
as
set
out
by
this
court
is
the
county,
the
city,
the
state
begins
with
jurisdiction.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
well,
i
think
that
what
happened
is
that
judge
quackenbush
when
he...
clearly,
we
all
relied
on
montana.
it
was
briefed
by
both
parties
and
we
believed
it
to
be
the
law.
i
think
that
what
happened
was
that
judge
quackenbush
took
a
broad
reading
of
his
second
exception,
which
we
believe
needs
to
be
narrowed
as
a
result
of
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
that's
all.
we
should
be
able
to--
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
--what
we
said
was,
i
think,
that
there's
two
tests
that
i
guess
that
we
would
concede.
initially,
we
were
indicating
that
we
thought
we
should
zone
all
of
the
fee
land,
including
that
owned
by
members.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
no,
we
do
not.
we
do
not
take
the
position
that
the
indian...
excuse
me...
non-members,
we're
talking
about
non-member-owned
fee
land
only.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
that's
correct.
we
believe
that--
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
--i
think
it's
best
illustrated
by
this
joint
appendix.
this
map
was
included--
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
--in
1954
the
yakima
nation
got
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
to
close
all
of
the
public
roads
into
the
forested
area
of
the
reservation.
the
only
people
allowed
in
the
forested
area
of
the
reservation
are
members
of
the
yakima
indian
nation
and
people
who
are
permitted
there
by
the
yakima
indian
nation
or
the
bia.
so
that
area
was
closed
to
any
non-member
or
non-permittee.
you
could
not
go
onto
that
land,
you
could
not
use
the
public
roads
that
were
constructed
with
public
dollars.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
the
reason
was,
as
i
think
the
evidence
would
show,
was
to
protect
the
timber
resource,
to
protect
the
game
and
fish,
and
to
have
a
place
for
the
tribe.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
well,
i
think
that
that,
it
alters
it
because
it
was
a
mind
set
in
which
everybody
tried
the
case,
your
honor.
once
you
eliminate
that
and
take
it
out
of
the
fact
and
just
say
that
we
treat
it
as
a
forested
area,
just
exactly
the
same
as
a
national
forest,
in
which
mostly
there
is
forest
lands
owned
by
the
federal
government
and
checkerboarded
deeded
lands,
and
look
at
it
in
that
fashion,
then
i
think
you
change
the
manner
in
which
the
court
looked
at
those
lands.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
no,
not
clearly.
but
you
would
not
have
been
able
to
use
it
prior
to
the
closure.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
just
to
the...
correct,
it's
closed
to
the
extent
that
your
land
and
my
land
are
closed.
we
have
a
road
that
goes
by
them.
we
don't
allow
trespassers
to
come
upon
it.
i
agree,
we
would
not...
as
a
non-permittee
or
as
a
non-member,
i
wouldn't
be
able
to
go
on
the
land.
mr.
brendale,
and
the
record
reflects
this,
who
owned
the
land
out
there,
had
to
go
to
court
repeatedly
in
order
to
get
even
access.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
that
potential
exists
under
the
scheme
that
i
suggest.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
yes,
they
could.
they
would
have
to--
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
--i
submit
that
the
rules
of
this
court
would
allow
for
that,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
no.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
no.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
that's
correct,
it's
unique
to
this
indian
reservation.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
sure.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
well,
i
think
that
the--
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
--historically,
no.
in
1855
when
the
treaty
was
written,
the
power
was
there.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
the
whole
reservation
was
trust--
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
--well,
two
things.
one,
i
think
the
closed
area
is
now
open
and
so
we
can
go
on
the
public
roads.
so
that
we
would
be
in
a
position
to
inspect.
so
that
limitation
is
removed.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
well,
i
suppose
that
is
up
to
dispute.
the
letter
from
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs...
what
closed
this
area
other
than
a
resolution
from
the
tribe,
these
are
federally
funded
roads
which
are
public
roads
and
can
only
be
closed
for
some
very
specific
emergencies.
the
bia
has
finally
said,
in
april
of
1988,
you
can
go
on
those
roads.
they
are
now
public
roads.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
that
is
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
correct.
that's
our
whole
point.
it's
not
closed
and
that's
why
you
have
to--
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
--and
that's
my
point.
if
mr.
brendale,
who
owns
the
land,
invites
me
on
the
land,
i
can
go.
if
one
of
the
tribal
members
invites
me
to
go
on
the
land
as
a
permittee,
i
can
go.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
that's
correct.
but
again,
i
would
not...
as
the
chief
justice
indicates,
there
are
places
throughout
the
entire
nation
that
that
is
the
case.
you
just
can't
get
out
of
your
car
and
set
up
a
fire
on
somebody's
private
land.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
well,
first
of
all,
you
know,
looking
at
zoning,
we
would
not
be
interested,
nor
would
the
county
i
think
even
consider,
a
plat,
for
example,
which
is
what
was
proposed
by
mr.
brendale,
unless
there
was
access
to
it.
i.e.,
the
roads
are
now
open,
he's
going
to
have
to
have
access
before
his
plat
is
going
to
be
allowed.
the
thing--
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
--well,
that's
correct.
it's
not
only
arbitrary--
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
--well,
i
agree
coupled
with
the
fact
that
there's
a
specific
code
of
federal
regulations
that
says
all
roads
that
are
built
with
public
money
are
public
roads.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
by
a
non-member.
the
reality
is,
we
talk
about
our
pristine
forests
and
yet
the
testimony
is
is
that
the
tribe,
their
own
logging
operation
takes
out
over
100
million
board-feet
a
year.
they
agreed
that
that
would
be
round-trip
40,000
logging
trucks
going
back
and
forth
in
one
year.
you
know,
there's
a
lot
of
activity
going
out
on
that
closed
area
of
the
reservation.
this
isn't
a
wilderness
area.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
not
specifically,
but
that's
exactly
what
one
of
our
contentions
is,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
the
second
exception
to
the
montana
ruling
was
a
statement
by
this
court
that,
if
a
tribe
or
if
a
county
or
a
city
is
going
to
impose
civil
regulatory
control,
they
should
take
into
account
the
special
needs
of
the
tribe.
let
me
give
you
an
example.
in
this
case,
mr.
brendale,
so
you
understand,
he
files
for
a
plat.
the
tribe
gets
notice
of
that.
the
tribe
in
turn...
our
zoning
administrator
said
this
is
going
to
have...
this
is
going
to
be...
excuse
me...
environmentally
insignificant.
the
tribe
goes:
how
can
you
do
that?
that's
crazy.
so
they
appeal,
have
a
three-day
hearing
before
the
board
of
county
commissioners.
the
county
commissioners
of
yakima
county
ordered
an
environmental
impact
statement
before
mr.
brendale
could
go
forward.
at
that
point,
the
tribe
sued.
we
say,
look,
how
can
the
tribe...
how
can
what
we
did
affect
their
political
integrity
when
we
did
what
they
want?
we
granted
their
request
for
an
environmental
impact
statement
in
mr.
brendale's
property.
our
view
is
that
this
exception,
rather
than
reading
it
broadly,
if
we
don't
do
away
with
it
altogether...
i
mean,
we
honestly
believe--
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
--absolutely,
we
do,
and
i
think
it's
demonstrated--
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
--no,
there's
no
direction
in
the
federal
law
other
than
the
montana
test,
which
we
believe,
if
you
read
it
closely,
when
they
say
"may
retain",
that
in
fact
this
court
was
establishing,
telling
us,
to
the
extent
that
there's
federal
mandate
from
this
court
in
indian
matters,
yes,
we're
bound
to
take
into
consideration
those
special
needs.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
well,
i
will
in
just
a
second
if
i
can
get
to.
i
think,
though,
that
if
not,
if
in
fact
we
are
going
to
say
what
does
that
second
exception
in
montana
mean...
the
tribe
encouraged
you
to
take
a
very
broad
reading.
we
say
take
a
narrow
reading.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
that's
correct.
and
i
think
that
they're
asking...
the
essence
of
the
yakima's
position
and
the
amicus
position
is,
you
need
to
repeal
oliphant
or
overrule
oliphant,
you
need
to
overrule
montana.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
i
think
initially
we
were.
i
want
to
suggest
to
you
some
language...
not
language,
but
the
framework
of
a
test
that
we
believe
works
and
will
give--
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
--it
could
and
it
can,
there's
no
question.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
yes,
it
does.
but
what
we're
suggesting,
though,
when
you
look
at
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
what
is
it
to
give,
this
court
has
said
that
we
are
only
going
to
have
the
tribes
exercise
regulatory
control
over
non-indians
on
deeded
lands
under
extreme
circumstances.
we
suggest
that
the
test
should
be
a
compelling
interest
test.
we
equate
compelling
interest
with
self-government.
if
the
county
is
going
to
do
something
or
the
city
that
would
affect
the
tribe's
ability
to
govern
their
own
members
or
their
own
land,
then
yes,
it
should
be
knocked
down.
there's
no
question
about
it.
and
the
tribe
should
have
authority,
if
they
pass
an
ordinance
that
will
affect
their
own
people,
to
have
control
over
non-members.
let
me
give
you
an
example.
it's
an
example
that
was
used
in
the
state's
brief.
but
if
the
tribe
wants
to
pass
an
ordinance
that
says,
we
are
going
to
impose
a
sales
tax
on
our
members,
then
we
concede
they
should...
the
safeway
store
in
the
city
of
toppenish,
which
is
deeded
land
in
a
non-indian,
they
should
in
fact
be
required
to
collect
that
tax,
which
is
the
other
side
of
the
colville
test,
in
which
this
court
said
to
the
indians:
you're
going
to
have
to
collect
tax
on
trust
land.
it's
our
position
that
you
need
to
take
the
same...
treat
indian
and
non-indian
the
same
with
a
general
rule.
if
the
general
rule
is
that
the
tribe
shall
have
jurisdiction
over
trust
land,
the
general
rule
should
be
that
the
cities,
the
counties,
the
political
subdivisions
should
have
control
over
the
non-member
deeded
land.
it
seems
to
me
that
without
that
we
end
up
with
sort
of
a
crazy
situation,
which
is,
in
an
example
out
of
the
south
dakota
brief.
it's
a
little
extreme,
but
it's
true.
in
oliphant,
we're
saying,
if
it's
a
crime,
a
25
dollar
speeding
ticket,
the
tribe
can't
do
it.
it
can't
do
it.
in
this
case,
the
ninth
circuit
upholds
an
ordinance
whose
penalty
provision
is
exclusion
from
the
reservation.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
i
think
oliphant
was
the
interpretation
of
statutes
in
the
sense
that
it
determined
that
for
the
criminal
process,
for
jurisdictional,
both
treaty
reserved
jurisdiction
and
inherent
jurisdiction,
the
tribes
had
no
criminal
jurisdiction
over
non-indians.
and
to
the
extent
that
it
interpreted
the
general
allotment
acts
and
found
that
that's
what
they
provided,
it
becomes
a
statutory
interpretation.
but
it
seems
to
me
it
set
out
broad
principles
that
this
court
has
followed,
followed
in
montana,
and
should
follow
here.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
but
it's
exactly
the
same
situation
the
county
has
when
it's
going
to
zone
a
piece
of
land
that's
right
next
to
a
city.
these
tensions
between
two
governments
that
have
an
interest
in
particular
land
for
zoning
questions
is
not
new.
all
we're
saying,
justice
scalia,
is
give
us
a
rule
that
both
can
understand,
that's
clear,
and
that's
the
bright
line,
and
then
provide
for
an
exception
requiring
us
to
take
into
account
the
tribes
interest,
but
only
the
interest
where
what
we're
doing
is
affecting
their
ability
to
control
themselves
or
their
members.
there
is
just--
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
--well,
with
respect
to
mr.
wilkinson,
it
seems
to
me
that,
again,
the
test
that
we
are
suggesting,
even
under
the
montana
misapplication,
i
guess,
which
i'm
calling
it
a
misapplication
to
a
certain
degree
by
the
trial
court...
you
know,
mr.
wilkinson's
property,
as
i
say,
is
on
the
north
edge
of
the
county.
it's
four
miles
from
the
populated
city.
there
are
or
that
side
of
what
we
call
the
ahtanum
ridge,
which
is
the
north
ridge
of
the
reservation,
there
are
480
non-indians,
there
are
2048
indians.
there
was
testimony
with
respect
to
the
irrigated
farmland.
again,
the
court
specifically
found
that
that
development
has
no
impact.
let
me
just
say
something
about
that
development,
just
to
give
you
an
example
of
why
i
think
there
are
in
fact
constitutional
issues
here.
the
tribe's
zoning
ordinance,
as
you
know,
calls
for
no
judicial
review,
not
even
by
the
tribal
court.
it
can't
be
reviewed
by
a
state
court.
mr.
wilkinson's
property
under...
the
tribe's
view
is
that
it
is
farmland.
the
testimony
is
unequivocal
in
the
case
that
that
land
is
useless
unless
you
can
get
water
to
it.
mr.
wilkinson
has
no
water.
the
effect
of
the
tribe's
zoning
if
it
applies
to
him
is
a
taking,
a
taking
which
cannot
be
redressed
because
the
tribe
specifically
in
the
zoning
ordinance,
in
addition
to
their
other
position,
still
indicate
that
they
maintain
their
sovereign
immunity.
if
it
please
the
court,
i'd
like
to
reserve
whatever
i
have
left.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
mr.
chief
justice:
i
think
one
of
mr.
weaver's
analogies
just
towards
the
end
here
points
out
part
of
the
problem,
why
we
believe
that
there
are
constitutional
issues
here
in
terms
of
taking
and
how
the
tribe
is
protected
and
individual
citizens
are
not.
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
toppenish
is
a
yakima
indian.
she
participates
fully,
as
do
the
tribal
members,
in
the
government
of
the
cities,
the
counties,
and
the
state.
mr.
brendale
and
mr.
wilkinson,
as
was
pointed
out,
cannot
vote,
do
not
participate.
the
general
allotment
acts
in
our
view
eliminated
the
exclusive
use
language
upon
which
mr.
weaver
attempts
to
rely.
footnote
9
in
the
montana
decision
goes
through
this.
the
tribes...
and
both
oliphant
and
in
montana
attempted
to
use
the
same
language.
we
believe
that
the
language
difference...
and
i
think
there
is
a
couple
of
words
difference
between
the
crow
treaty
and
the
yakima
treaty...
is
a
distinction
without
a
difference,
and
that
this
court's
rulings
previously
in
this
matter
should
in
fact,
should
follow
that
language
and
should
rule
that
montana
does
apply.
but
i
think
the
question
justice
stevens
had,
is
it
the
only
case.
i
think
it's
the
only
case
in
the
serse
that
it
follows
the
law
up
to
that
point
as
it's
developed
in
the
whole
area
of
the
indian
law.
we're
confronted
with
this
question
of
civil
regulatory
control,
and
what
we
are
suggesting
is
a
rule
based
on
montana
that
puts
us
on
an
equal
basis
with
the
tribe.
we
start
out
with
the
basis
with
all
indians
that
they
control
the
deeded
lands...
excuse
me,
the
trust
land...
no
matter
where
it
is.
they
acknowledge
their
position
is,
if
there
was
one
lot
of
trust
land
in
the
middle
of
the
city
of
toppenish,
they
should
exercise
control
over
it
and
in
fact
do
exercise
control
over
it
for
all
purposes,
including
taxation
and
zoning.
there's
a
code
of
federal
regulations
that
says
that.
what
the
county
is
saying...
and
then
there
are
some
exceptions.
this
court
in
colville
gave
a
very
narrow
exception
and
said,
tribes,
that's
true,
you
can
control
your
trust
land,
but
within
a
very
narrow
exception,
when
the
state
government's
interest
is
being
affected
by
what
you
are
doing,
in
fact
the
state
can
have
some
control
over
trust
land,
i.e.,
you're
going
to
be
required
to
collect
taxes.
all
we're
asking
for
is
an
equal
right,
that
you
approach
even
a
brendale
situation
as
to
start
with
the
county
having
jurisdiction
and
then
we're
saying
the
carefully
circumscribed
exception.
because
of
the
constitutional
limitations,
we
believe
that
exception
can't
be
given
the
broad
analysis
that
the
tribes
are
in
fact
encouraging,
but
in
fact
should
be
extremely
narrow.
and
what
this
court
should
say
to
the
tribe
is:
if
the
state
action
will
affect
their
ability
to
govern
themselves
and
their
members...
that's
what
their
inherent
sovereignty,
that's
what's
left
of
their
inherent
sovereignty.
it's
just
judge
quackenbush
said,
the
problem
is
the
allotment
act.
but
we
have
to
deal
with
history.
we
can't
just
overlook
history.
we've
got
to
recognize
that,
because
of
an
act
of
congress,
we
have
non-indians,
american
citizens,
who
are
on
this
property,
who
have
rights.
and
in
order
to
balance
those
rights,
we
are
suggesting
that
the
exception
needs
to
be
very
narrow.
look
at
the
cases
that
were
cited
in
support
of
the
exception.
fisher
involved
all
indians
and
adoptions,
and
in
fact
has
been
basically,
the
need
for
fisher,
eliminated
by
the
indian
chlid
welfare
act.
the
other
cases
that
were
cited
in
support
of
that
second
exception
i
believe
give
weight
to
our
argument
that
it
was
intended
to
be
strict,
very
narrow.
thank
you
very
much.
