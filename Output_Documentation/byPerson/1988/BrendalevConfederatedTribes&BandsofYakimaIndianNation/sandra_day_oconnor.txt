what
were
the
findings
of
the
district
court
in
regard
to
the
montana
factors?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
those
fact
findings?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
binding
on
the
ninth
circuit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
do
you
think
the
county
car
zone
on
the
reservation
beyond
the
fee
owners
of
non-members?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
there
was
language
in
your
brief
that
went
further
than
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
don't
take
that
position
any
more?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
what
did
the
bia
do?
it
just
said,
you
can
go
ahead
and
use
the
public
roads.
did
it
change
all
aspects
of
the
closing?
it
didn't
say
people
can
go
on
and
use
that
property?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
it's
still
closed
in
a
sense?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
county
can
zone
property
in
the
closed
area
and,
for
instance,
permit
tourist
development
in
an
area
that
the
tribe
is
trying
to
keep
pristine
and
undeveloped?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
say
yes,
the
county
can
do
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
though
it's
a
little
patch
in
the
middle
of
the
closed
area
of
the
reservation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you're
telling
us
we
need
to
overrule
montana,
too.
it
seems
to
me
both
sides
are
taking
very
extreme
positions
with
regard
to
the
language
of
the
montana
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
would
concede
that
the
action
of
the
county
in
its
zoning
policies
can
have
an
effect,
a
direct
effect,
on
the
economic
security
or
health
or
health
or
welfare
of
the
tribe?
it
could,
it
can?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
what
zoning
does,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
would
a
non-member
go
about
challenging
an
indian
zoning
matter
that
the
non-member
thought
was
totally
arbitrary
and
capricious?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
take
the
position,
however,
that
the
tribe
has
the
sole
zoning
power
even
within
incorporated
cities
on
the
reservation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
don't
we
have
some
district
court
findings
here
with
regard
to
one
of
these
cases,
wilkinson,
to
the
effect
that
the
tribe's
interests
were
not
affected?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
shouldn't
we
recognize
those
findings
and
accept
those?
