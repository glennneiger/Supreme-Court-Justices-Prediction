we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
87-1622,
philip
brendale
versus
confederated
tribes
and
bands
of
the
yakima
indian
nation,
and
companion
cases.
mr.
sullivan,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
largest
geographically
or
population?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
may
also
retain
what?
will
you
state
what
the
second
exception
is?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
ninth
circuit
kind
of
took
off
with
that,
didn't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
not
even
common
to
other
indian
reservations.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
sullivan.
mr.
weaver,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
did
the
brendale
case
get
to
the
ninth
circuit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
mr.
brendale,
he
appealed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
case
is
nonetheless
here.
they've
briefed
the
thing,
and
they
are
asking
us
to
reverse
the
ninth
circuit
on
the
brendale
property,
as
well
as
on
the
wilkinson
property.
maybe
all
you're
saying
is
they
don't
have
much
of
an
argument.
but
certainly,
technically
it's
before
us.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
language
is
it
in
the
yakima
treaty
that
you
think
entitles
your
client
to
a
more
favorable
ruling
on
an
effort
to
zone
than
the
comparable
language
in
the
crow
treaty?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
doesn't
say
anything
about
the
reserve
power.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
weaver.
mr.
sullivan,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sullivan.
the
case
is
submitted.
