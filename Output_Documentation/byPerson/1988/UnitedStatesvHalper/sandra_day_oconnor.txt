well,
mr.
dreeben,
do
you
think
that
the
amount
of
the
so-called
civil
penalty
has
to
bear
some
relationship
to
the
cost
to
the
government?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
the
statute
has
now
been
amended
to
a
range
of
not
less
than
$5,000
and
not
more
than
$10,000?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
roberts,
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
court
in
every
case
brought
under
this
false
claims
act
has
to
force
the
government
to
litigate
the
specific
cost
to
the
government
of
prosecuting
and
investigating
that
case
to
see
if
it
bears
a
rational
relation
to
the
amount
of
the
fine?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that...
that
just
seems
like...
a...
a...
an
unusually
complex
burden
to
place
on
the
government.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
the
government
can
win
its
case
just
by
producing
average
costs
of
investigation
and
prosecution
of
civil
fraud?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
doesn't
this
statute
permit
private
suits
for
recovery?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so
what
happens
if
a
private
person
were
here
instead
of
the
government
seeking
triple
the
penalty?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
if
a
private
person
brings
it
under
this
statute,
you
would
still
be
arguing
that
it's
invalid
and
the
court
has
to
look
at
the
amount.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
rather
odd
to
apply
a
double
jeopardy
analysis
if...
if
the
suit
is
brought
by
a
private
person,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
would
have
the
quixotic
effect
of
if
the
government
brought
the
civil
penalty
action
and...
and
sought
the
statutory
amount
of
the
penalty,
you
would
urge
a
double
jeopardy
application.
but
if
a
private
person
brought
the
action
and
sought
triple
the
amount,
then
no
double
jeopardy
application.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
if
all
that
has
been
done
under
the
criminal
case,
it's
hard
to
see
how...
how
the
costs
would
be
substantial
for
the
civil
prosecution...
the
civil
action.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
can
rely
on...
on
the
conviction
obtained--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
was
all
done
in
the
criminal
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
in
theory,
it
could
be
under
the
sentencing
guidelines,
presumably.
