chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
87-1383,
united
states
v.
irwin
halper.
mr.
dreeben,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
there
some
sort
of
a
volume
discount,
though?
i
mean,
if
there
are
65
claims
investigated,
it
wouldn't
cost
as
much
as
to
investigate
just
one.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
the
statute
has
to
recognize
some
sort
of
volume
discount
or
economy
of
scale,
you
couldn't
have
a
fixed
penalty
for
65
different
counts.
it
would
have
to
be
a
kind
of
a
declining
scale
of
some
sort.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
roberts,
we'll
hear
from
you
now.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
did
the
district
court
reach
that
conclusion,
mr.
roberts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
the
district
court
hold
a
hearing
and
give
the
government
an
opportunity
to
present
evidence?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
did
the
district
court
do
that
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
in
this
case,
mr.
roberts,
the
district
court
had
found
through
whatever
method
he
used
that
the
costs
were
$16,000
and
the
statute
required
the
imposition
of
a
penalty
of,
say,
$40,000.
let's
say
there
were
20
counts
instead
of
65.
is
that
good
or
bad
under
your
theory?
can
that
be
maintained
as
a
civil
prosecution?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
there's
no
play
at
the
joints.
it's
just
strictly
the
cost
of
prosecution
of
this
particular
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
plus
the
actual
damages.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
this
were
a
criminal
prosecution
and
exactly
the
same
facts
were
shown,
but
the
statute,
after
a
criminal
conviction,
provided
for
a
fine
of
$1
million.
now,
do...
do
you
think
the
district
court
could
impose
a
fine
of
$1
million
in
a
case
like
this
in
a
criminal
prosecution?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
at
what
point
in
the
trial
does
the
government
come
in
and
make
this
sort
of
a
showing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
does
your
argument
do,
mr.
roberts,
to
the
punitive
damages
that...
that
are
awarded
in
many
civil
actions?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
the...
the
action
of
a
governmental
court
in
awarding
the
damages
does
not
make
it
subject
to
any
sort
of
a--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
would
also
mean
that
the
civil
proceeding
wouldn't
be
a
civil
proceeding,
wouldn't
it,
that
you
have
to
have
a
reasonable
doubt
standard
and
all
the
safeguards
that
apply
in
a
criminal
trial?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
would
be
a
rather
strange
animal.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
mr.
dreeben,
you
have
nine
minutes
remaining.
rebuttal
argument
of
michael
r.
dreeben--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--it...
it
is
true
what...
what
amicus
says
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
applies
to
the
government--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
not...
not
to
private
parties.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
other
words,
any
civil
plaintiff
who
obtains
punitive
damages
from
a
court
is
perhaps
violating
the
double
jeopardy
clause?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
the
case
is
submitted.
