mr.
roberts,
isn't
there
another
difference
too
on
the
triple
damages
setting?
the
triple
damages
are
paid
to
a
private
third
party,
but
when
the
united
states
recovers
damages
after
a
conviction,
they
only
get
single
damages,
don't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
there
another
factor
in
the...
in
the
qui
tam
action
and
in
the
treble
damage
antitrust
actions
that
the
extra
recovery
is
partially
justified
as
an
incentive
for
the
third
private
party
to
bring
the
action?
so,
it's
not
strictly
compensatory,
but
yet
it...
it
pays
for
getting
something
done
by
getting
the
third
party
activated
in
the
matter.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
that's
true.
but
there's
still
the
incentive.
if
you're
going
to
get
treble
damages
instead
of
single
damages,
there's
much
more...
greater
motivation
to
bring
the
action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
is
the
maximum
criminal
fine
you
could
recover?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
could
recover
a
lot
of
money
in
the
criminal
proceeding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well--
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
this
is
not
a
criminal
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
it's
not
unusual
to
provide
in
a
statute
that
the
plaintiff
recovers
single,
treble
damages,
plus
attorney's
fees,
plus
costs
of
suit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
you
can...
i
mean,
that
would
not
be
an
unusual
statute
to
say
government
can
recover
its
costs
and
they
have
to
prove
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you...
you
haven't
really
called
our
attention
to
anything
that
suggests
that
the...
the
government...
the
statute
was
designed
to
enable
the
government
to
recover
the
costs
of
running
the
government,
including
its
fraud
investigation
and
all
the
rest,
have
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
didn't
even
mention
it,
did
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
which
was...
you
had
to
pay
the
informer
half
of
the
recovery
there.
