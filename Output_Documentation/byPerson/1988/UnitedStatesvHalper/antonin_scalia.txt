justice
antonin
scalia
was
there
a
lot
of
discussion
in
that
amendment
about
how
much
it
costs
in
fact
to
prosecute
a
claim
or
to
investigate
a
claim?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
there
any
discussion
about
how
much
it
costs
to
investigate
or
to
prosecute
a
claim?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
congress
unaware
of
the...
the
principle
of
economies
of
scale?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
any
reason
to
believe
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
amendment
or
of
the
original
statute
that
congress
at
all
adverted
to
how
much
it
costs
to
investigate
and
prosecute?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
sure
congress
was
aware
that
we...
we
might
strike
it
down
if
it
went
too
far,
but
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is...
is
do
we
really
take
this
as
a
congressional
estimation
of
how
much
it
costs
to
investigate
and
prosecute?
was
there
any
attempt
whatever
to
estimate
that?
or
rather,
was
it
an
attempt
to
pick
a
figure
that
we
would
leave
alone?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
long
as
that's
the
theory,
it's
all
right.
i
mean,
so
all
congress
has
to
say
is
at
the
beginning
of
a
statute
that
imposes
a
$10,000
forfeiture
or
100...
or
$1
million
forfeiture,
the
theory
of
this
statute
is
not
criminal.
it
is
simply
a
civil
penalty.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
the
last.
don't
we
have--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
look
it
to
see
if
it
bears
any
reasonable
relationship
to
the...
to
the
monetary
cost
to
the
government
in
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
we...
we
can
never
look
into
the...
the
monetary
amount?
is
that
your
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
determine
what?
to
determine
whether
it
is
reasonable
to
think
that
congress
was
trying
to
come
up
with
an
amount
that
overall
would
compensate
the
government?
justice
antonin
scalia
my
problem
is
that
it...
it
is
so
obvious
that
it
does
not
cost
the
government
as
much
to
prosecute
65
repetitive
violations
than
it
does
to
prosecute
65
separate
violations.
that
is
such
an
obvious
principle
that
any
legislative
body
that
had
in
mind
providing
for
whatever
you
call
the
average
case
an
amount
that
would
not
be
taking
from
that
defendant
any
more
than
would
be
necessary
to
compensate
the
government...
any
legislative
body
would
take
account
of
the
fact
of...
of
that
economy
of
scale
and...
and
would
not
say
$2,000
per
offense,
but
would
say
$2,000
per
offense,
with
a
maximum
of
blank
dollars
per
prosecution
or
something
like
that.
otherwise,
i
really...
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
the
government
is
even
trying
to
make
the...
to
make
the...
it
isn't
the
punishment
fit
the
crime.
what
would
you
call
it?
the...
the
penalty
fit
the
civil
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about...
what
about
this
medicare
fraud
unit
that
is
over
there
in...
in
hhs?
and...
and
they're
permanently
in
place
just
to
look
at
these
submissions
by...
by
doctors.
and
this
is
the
only...
the
only
guy
they
caught
all
year
long.
why...
why
wouldn't
the...
the
total
annual
salary
of
that
whole
unit
properly
be
chargeable
to...
to
this
prosecution?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he
caused
the
whole
year's
worth
of
work.
there
was
nobody
else
that
they
caught.
i
mean,
as
far
as
that
year's
of
work
go,
he
was
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
you'd
say
that
there
may
be
other
limitations
on
the
level
of
private
actions
that
may
be
allowed,
but
not
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
fine
can
be
a
fine
even
though
not
assessed
in
a...
it
possibly
can
be
a
fine
for
that
purpose
even
though
not
assessed
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
strange
dichotomy
you're
giving
us
here.
you're...
you're
saying
this
is
bad
because
he
has
been
convicted
criminally,
although
they
could
have
made
this
an
additional
part
of
the
criminal
penalty.
they
could
have
easily
said
in
addition
to
the
criminal
fine
already
allowed,
you
will
be
fined
$2,000
per...
per
offense.
you
acknowledge
that
would
be
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
wouldn't
be
cruel
or
unusual.
it
wouldn't
be
excessive
or
anything
if
it
were
done
in
the
criminal
case.
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but...
but
only
because
he
has
been
convicted
criminally
already,
it's
bad
here.
had
he
not
been...
had
there
not
been
any
criminal
offense
involved,
the
government
could
have...
could
have
assessed
this
civil
penalty
without
any
problem.
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
strange.
i
think
that's
a
strange
result.
justice
antonin
scalia
--does
the
sentencing
commission
consider
civil
penalties
in...
in
formulating
its
guidelines
for...
for
criminal
fines?
justice
antonin
scalia
that...
that
discretion
will
presumably
be...
be
limited
by
the...
by
the
commission,
the
sentencing
commission,
won't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
the
government's
position,
though,
that
even
if
the
government
had
lost
the
criminal
prosecution,
it
could
then
have
brought
this
action
with
a
burden
of
proof
not
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
but
just
more
likely
than
not,
and
imposed
the...
the
level
of
fines
that
are
at
issue
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
just...
just
compensation
to
the
government.
