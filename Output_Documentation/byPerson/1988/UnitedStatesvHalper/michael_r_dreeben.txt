mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
the
application
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
civil
false
claims
act,
title
31
u.s.c.
3729.
the
district
court
invoked
the
double
jeopardy
clause
to
bar
a
recovery
by
the
government
of
penalties
under
the
false
claims
act
from
appellee
who
had
previously
been
criminally
convicted
of
making
the
same
false
claims.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
your
honor,
he
had
been
fined.
appellee
knowingly
made
65
separate
false
claims
under
the
medicare
program,
each
of
which
overcharged
the
government
by
$9.
the
false
claims
act
provides
a
$2,000
mandatory
penalty
at
the
time
that
this
action
was
brought
for
each
such
false
claim.
the
government
accordingly
sought
a
penalty
of
$130,000
in
this
case.
the
district
court
focused
on
the
fact
that
appellee's
overpayment
by
the
government
was
$585
from
his
65
false
claims.
it
compared
the
penalty
to
the
loss
and
determined
that
in
the
factual
setting
of
this
case,
the
sanction
amounted
to
a
criminal
penalty
that
could
not
be
imposed
in
view
of
appellee's
previous
criminal
conviction
and
punishment.
it
therefore
held
the
false
claims
act
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
appellee
in
this
case.
we
believe
that
the
district
court's
analysis
and
conclusions
are
incorrect.
the
false
claims
act
has
been
on
the
books
for
125
years.
it
has
been
upheld
before
by
this
court
against
a
double
jeopardy
challenge
very
similar
to
the
one
accepted
by
the
court
below.
a
statute
very
similar
to
the
false
claims
act
was
upheld
after
that
case
in
a
similar
double
jeopardy
challenge.
in
the
false
claims
act,
congress
has
provided
a
reasonable
lump
sum
recovery
for
every
false
claim
made
on
the
government.
it
is
designed
to
cover
reasonably
anticipated
losses
in
the
average
case.
it
is
also
designed
to
compensate
the
government
for
the
costs
of
investigation
and
prosecution,
which
can
be
extremely
heavy
in
ferreting
out,
detecting
and
bringing
wrongdoers
to
justice.
finally,
it
serves
the
purpose
of
deterring
wrongdoers
from
committing
false
claims
such
as
the
kind
that
appellee
committed.
it
is
not
a
criminal
statute.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it...
it
may
be
true
that
in
some
cases
the
costs
of
investigation
do
not
rise
as
rapidly
as
the
number
of
false
claims,
but
congress
can
anticipate
that
over
the
large
majority
of
cases,
when
someone
has
cheated
the
government
a
large
multiple
of
times,
the
costs
of
investigation
do
go
up.
this
case,
although
the
facts
surrounding
the
investigation
are
not
in
the
record,
does
illustrate
that
there
are
very
heavy
costs
involved
in
prosecuting
medicare
fraud.
there
was
a
substantial
degree
of
investigation
that
was
required,
and
appellee's
criminal
trial
consumed
four
days.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
government
has
taken
discovery
from
mr.
halper
in
the
civil
action
and
has
determined
that
he
has
substantial
assets
that
were
transferred
out
of
his
name
into
his
wife's
name
and
into
his
son's
name.
and
it's
the
opinion
of
the
united
states
attorney's
office
that's
responsible
for
this
case
that
there
is
a
good
chance
of
collecting
part
or
all
of
the
judgment
in
this
case
should
this
court
reverse
and
allow
the
case
to
go
forward.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
your
honor.
it
is
not
a
finding
of
fact.
this
case
was
decided
on
summary
judgment.
the
government
moved
for
collection
of
the
full
amount
of
the
penalties
to
which
it
is
entitled
under
the
false
claims
act
by
virtue
of
the
false
claims.
it
never
submitted
any
evidence
of
its
costs
of
investigation.
the
district
court
essentially
speculated
about
what
it
believed
those
costs
of
investigation
would
be,
without
any
evidence
whatsoever.
one
of
the
objections
that
we
have
to
this--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
it
simply
said--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--not...
not
to
my
knowledge.
there
is
no
rationale
whatsoever
except
for
the
fact
that
the
district
court
simply
believed
that
that
amount
would
be
adequate
in
this
case
to
cover
the
government's
expenses.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
in
the
average
case
it
does
have
to
bear
some
cost,
but
this
court
made
quite
clear
in
rex
trailer
co.
v.
united
states
that
the
task
for
deciding
what
a
reasonable
recovery
would
be
per
fraud
is
one
for
congress
so
long
as
it
remains
within
a
reasonable
realm
of...
of
magnitude.
and
clearly,
$2,000,
as
an
estimate
of
what
the
government
would
have
to
devote
in
terms
of
resources
to
prosecute
fraud,
is
reasonable.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct,
your
honor.
it
was
amended
in
1986,
when
congress
took
a
look
at
the
false
claims
act,
concluded
that
the
$2,000
figure
which
had
originally
been
set
in
1863
had
now
been
so
eroded
by
inflation
that
it
really
was
not
fulfilling
the
purposes
it
was
intended
to
fulfill.
and
congress
accordingly
did
raise
the
figure
that
can
be
permitted
for
each
false
claim,
and
it
allowed
a
certain
amount
of
discretion
to
district
courts
to
decide
between
$5,000
and
$10,000
how
much
should
be
awarded.
but
congress
did
take
a
look
at
the
false
claims
amount
and
realized
that
$2,000
in
1863
dollars
would
now
be
about
$18,000.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
your
honor.
i--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
believe
that
either
of
the
committee
reports
discussed
that
explicitly.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
congress
is
well
aware
of
it,
but
it's
also
aware
that
there
may
be
other
measures
of
recovery
that
are
appropriate--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think,
your
honor,
to
the
extent
that
congress
displayed
its
awareness
of
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
ex
rel.
marcus
v.
hess
and
that
the
congress
is
presumed
to
be
aware
of
other
decisions
of
this
court
that
have
held
that
reasonable
lump
sum
penalties
do
help
compensate
the
government
for
the
heavy
costs
of
investigation.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
that
both
elements
are
there.
there
was
not
a
scientific
study
that
i'm
aware
of
of
how
much
it
costs
the
government
on
average
to
investigate
fraud.
but
congress
was
made
aware
that
it
is
expensive
to
investigate
fraud,
and
it
did
provide
a
figure
that
it
felt
would
ensure
that
the
government
is
fully
compensated.
it
also
provided
the
$2,000
figure
originally
and
the
$5,000
to
$10,000
range
that's
currently
in
existence
to
provide
some
deterrence
so
that
there
is
an
economic
disincentive
for
continued
false
claims
of
this
nature.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
there
were
hearings
on
the
amendment.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
justice
department,
i
believe,
originally--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--now,
i'm
not
aware...
i
haven't
reviewed
the
transmittal
letters.
so,
i'm
not
aware.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
[inaudible]
justice--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--specifically
about
the...
the
need
for
a
particular
dollar
figure
for
costs,
i'm
not
sure
that
it
was.
but
the
legislative
history
does
display
a
desire
to
ensure
that
the
government
is
fully
compensated,
and
there
are
repeated
references
to
the
fact
that
it's
very
difficult
to
ferret
out
and
detect
fraud.
to
the
extent
that...
that
congress
is
aware
of...
of
these
problems,
it's
entitled
to
pick
a
reasonable
figure
to
address
them.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
it
would.
but
the
district
court
essentially
construed
the
sanction
in
this
case
to
be
so
heavy
as
to
amount
to
a
criminal
punishment,
and
the
logic
of
its
decision
would
require
the
case
to
be
tried
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
government
is
not
aware
of
how
we
would
live
with
a
ruling
like
this
because
we
would
never
know
in
advance
whether
a
case
would
be
civil
or
criminal
under
the
district
court's
test.
the
district
court
did
not
even
articulate
why
the
ratio
in
this
case
was
excessive
and
what
ratios
would
satisfy
it.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
if
the
statute
were
written
to
permit
that
result,
that
would
be
a
reasonable
way
to
handle
it,
but
the
statute
was
not
written
that
way.
the
1986
amendments
make
crystal
clear
that
congress
anticipated
mandatory,
automatic
forfeitures
for
each
fraud
that
was
committed
on
the
government
and
it
intended
that
the
government
be
able
to
collect
the
penalty
for
each
fraud
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--existed.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
your
honor,
it
would
if
in
fact
it
were
a
criminal
sanction.
we
think
where
the
district
court
went
wrong
is
in
analyzing
the
false
claims
act
to
impose
a
criminal
sanction
at
all.
the...
the
theory
of
the
action
is
to
compensate
the
government
for
false
claims
and
for
economic
damages
that
occur
from
such
false
claims,
and
it
is
not
intended
to
stigmatize
the
defendant
as
a
violator
of
criminal
laws
and,
therefore,
is
not
within
the
scope
of...
of
the
coverage
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
in
the
first
place.
this--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
the
first
step
in
the
analysis,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i...
i
think
that...
that
the
second
step
of
the
inquiry
that
this
court
has
suggested
does
require
some
oversight
of
whether
the
penalty
is
so
excessive
as
to
transform
it
into
a
criminal
one.
but
the
question
of...
of
what
dollar
figure
is
necessary
to
compensate
the
government
in
the
broad
run
of
cases
is
one
that
is...
that's
clearly
belongs
to
congress.
and
the
deference
that
is
owed
to
it
is
reflected
in
this
court's
frequent
admonition
that
it
would
take
the
clearest
proof
to
overcome
congress'
intent
to
create
a
civil
sanction
and
to
deem
it
transformed
into
a
criminal
one.
in
fact,
this
court
has
never
found
that
a
monetary
penalty
set
by
congress
in
the
fashion
of
the
false
claims
act
was
so
excessive
as
to
be
transformed
into
a
criminal
penalty.
the
only
settings
in
which
this
court
has
overturned
congress'
intent
to
create
a
civil
judgment
is
when
congress
has
prescribed
something
like
imprisonment
or
loss
of
nationality,
which
are
the
kinds
of
sanctions
that
are
really
not
consistent
with
civil
law
at
all.
but
a
fixed
monetary
penalty
is
a
historically
civil
kind
of
remedy.
it
is
related
to
an
action
in
debt,
and
this
court
[inaudible]
traced
the
history
of
actions
in
debt
in
tull
against
united
states
and
expressly
viewed
them
as
being
a
civil
type
of
recovery.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
no.
the
court
has
to
look
into
it
to
some
extent.
but
it
has
to
look
into
it
with
a
very
deferential
approach
to
it.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
to
determine
two
things:
first,
whether
the
amount
that
congress
came
up
with
does
bear
a
reasonable
relationship
to
its
purpose
of
compensating
the
government.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
in
the
average
case,
that's
correct.
not
in
every
specific
case
because
congress
is
legislating
for
the
broad
categories.
and
the
second
factor
is
whether
it's
reasonably
related
to
congress'
deterrent
purpose
without
so
moving
into
the
realm
of
over-deterrence
as
to
be
essentially
a
criminal
sanction.
there
would
come
a
point,
i'm...
i'm
quite
sure,
where
a...
a
fine
would
be
so
heavy
that
this
court
could
not
say
that
it
truly
is
civil
in
character,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
false
claims
act
comes
close
to
that.
fixed
monetary
sums
of
$1,000
were
common
in
the
early
part
of
this
century,
and
the
court
had
no
difficulty
in
hepner
against
united
states
and
in
united
states
v.
reagan
in
saying
that
those
kinds
of
penalties
were
civil.
the
false
claims
act
was
passed
in
1863.
when
congress
amended
the
false
claims
act
in
1986,
it
did
not
even
bring
the
$2,000
figure
up
to
where
inflation
had
eroded
it.
it
only
increased
it
a
small
fraction
of
that
amount.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
your
honor,
it
does
serve
both
the
purpose
of
deterring
repeated
small
frauds
and
of
compensating
the
government.
and
we've
never
denied
that
it
has
both
of
those
functions.
without
some
sort
of
a
fixed
monetary
penalty
that
attached
to
each
successive
small
fraud,
there
would
be
very
little
incentive
for
contractors
not
to
try
to
commit
small
frauds
in
the
hope
of
evading
detection.
the
medicare
program,
for
example,
gets
literally
millions
of
claims
made
on
it
each
year.
the
government
is
not
capable
nor
are
its
fiscal
intermediaries
capable
of
reviewing
all
of
those
claims.
so,
it
prescribes
a
figure
that
both
allows
it
to
get
compensated
when
it
does
catch
somebody
and
also
provides
an
economic
disincentive
for
continuing
it.
if...
if
there
were
not
a
fixed
penalty,
the
government
would
be
virtually
incapable
of
prosecuting
and
collecting
damages
for
this
kind
of
case
because
the...
the
burden
on
the
government
of
showing
how
much
did
it
cost
for
this
fbi
agent
to
conduct
this
interview--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--your
honor,
i
have
no
idea
how
the
district
court
knows
because
it
didn't
set
out
any
reasoning
and
it
had
no
evidence.
i
think
the
best
explanation
of
it
is
that
it
speculated.
it
substituted
its
judgment
for
congress'
judgment
about
what
an
appropriate
penalty
would
be.
in
other
settings,
congress
has
provided
formulas
for
recovery
of
damages
and
to
ensure
adequate
deterrence
of
wrongdoing.
the
best
example
of
that
is
perhaps
the
treble
damages
remedy
that's
allowed
for
sherman
act
violations.
it
has
never
been
held
by
this
court
that
congress
cannot
allow
an
action
for
treble
damages
to
follow
an
action
for
criminal
violations
under
the
sherman
act.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
it
is
our
position
that
this
statute--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
the
analysis
would
have
to
be
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
if
congress
had
picked
an
amount
that
was
so
excessive--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
correct.
and
as
to
this
statute,
that's
right
because
the
only
reason
why
a
penalty
would
be
large
is
if
someone
had
committed
a
very
large
number
of
false
claims
on
the
government.
that
is
the
explanation
for
the
penalty
in
this
case.
appellee
committed
65
knowing
false
claims
of
which
he
was
criminally
convicted.
and
the
penalty
for
that
corresponds
only
to
that
large
number
of
false
claims.
the
statute
isn't
transformed
into
a
criminal
type
of
penalty
simply
because
there
are
a
large
number
of
false
claims
involved.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
there
are
going
to
be
cases
where
the
costs
of
prosecution
do
rise
proportional
to
the
amount
of
false
claims.
so,
for
congress
to
be
limited
in
a
way
that
requires
it
to
reduce
the
government's
compensation
with
the
number
of
false
claims
may,
in
effect,
deprive
the
government
of
full
compensation
in
given
cases.
so,
the
lump
sum
penalty
does
function,
in
the
broad
category
of
cases,
to
ensure
that
the
government
is
recompensed
for
the
costs
of
investigating
these
false
claims
and
that
it
has
a
mechanism
to
ensure
deterrence
of
the
false
claims.
we
think
that
the
consideration
in
the
1986
amendments
of
the
penalty
reflects
a
very
recent
congressional
judgment
that
indeed
the
kinds
of
penalties
involved
in
this
case
are
civil
and
do
not
pose
the
double
jeopardy
problems
that
have
been
alluded
to
by
the
district
court.
congress
specifically
provided
for
a
form
of
collateral
estoppel
between
criminal
convictions
and
the
civil
judgments
which
recognizes
that
it
intended
that
one
action
follow
the
other.
it
also
recognized
that
in
cases
of
medicare
fraud,
there
may
be
a
very
large
number
of
false
claims.
so,
the
congressional
determination
in
this
case
was,
indeed,
that
the
statute
be
applied
very
much
in
the
fashion
that
it
was
applied
by
the
district
court
in
this
case.
if
the
district
court's
theory
were
adopted,
the
government
would
have
virtually
no
way
to
ensure
that
it
would
be
fully
compensated
when,
as
in
this
case,
there
are
a
great
number
of
false
claims.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
your
honor.
amicus
focuses
his
argument
solely
on
the
proposition
that
if
the
second
proceeding
involves
punishment,
then
it
is
barred
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
and
he
defines
punishment
to
mean
anything
in
addition
to
what
the
government
can
actually
show
are
its
out-of-pocket,
actual
losses.
this
court
in
the
hess
case
considered
the
identical
argument
to
that
and
held
that
to
the
extent
that
a
second
action
does
impose
some
punishment,
that
is
not
enough
to
declare
it
a
criminal
sanction.
and
the
double
jeopardy
clause's
concern
is
with
a
second
criminal
sanction,
not
with
a
second
proceeding
that
may
to
some
extent
impose
punishment.
the
sherman
act
treble
damages
remedy
in
punitive
damages
cannot
be
adequately
differentiated
merely
because
the
government
is
not
a
party
because
amicus
has
argued
that
the
prospective
must
be
from
the
defendant,
and
the
defendant
experiences
either
second
proceeding
as
punishment.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
true,
but
the
punishment
in
this
case,
if
there
is
some,
would
be
awarded
by
the
court
pursuant
to
a
statute
passed
by
congress,
and
there's
no
reason
why
the
double
jeopardy
clause
would
not
be
concerned
with
it.
the
hess
case
itself
involved
a
qui
tam
plaintiff,
and
the
court
considered
and
evaluated
the
double
jeopardy
clause
even
though
the
arguments
were
presented
in
the
brief
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
might
not
have
a
role
to
play
in
that
setting.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
your
honor,
we
don't
believe
that
it
does
violate
the
double
jeopardy
clause
for
any
civil
action
to
follow
a
criminal
one
even
if
there
is
a
recovery
above
and
beyond
actual
damages
because
that
is
not
the
line
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
draws.
it
protects
against
a
second
criminal
proceeding
because
the
constitution
draws
a
line
between
criminal
and
civil
proceedings
and
determines
that
criminal
proceedings
have
more
severe
consequences,
but
it
does
not
bar
a
second
civil
sanction
that
can
be
imposed
after
the
earlier
criminal
conviction.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
it
does,
your
honor,
but
in...
in
the
case
where
a
criminal
conviction
has
already
happened
and
the
private
plaintiff
brings
the
treble
damages
action,
he's
entitled
to
rely
on
the
facts
established
in
the
criminal
trial.
and
the
wrongdoer
has
already
been
exposed,
so
the
costs
of
investigation
would
be
far
less
in
that
kind
of
a--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
true,
your
honor,
but
the
same
incentives
exist
in
this
case
because
if
the
government
did
not
have
the
opportunity
to
recover
penalties,
it
would
be
virtually
incapable
of
prosecuting
small
frauds
like
this
because
the
costs
of
prosecuting
them
would
far
outweigh
the
costs
of
investigating.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
there
is
a
$250,000
per
count
penalty
that
could
be--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
correct,
but
under
the
sentencing
commission
guidelines,
the
fine
would
be
assessed
by
looking
in
part
at
the
actual
damage
to
the
government.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
so,
it's
a
very
different
formula
that
has
been
prescribed.
but
the
fact
that
there
is
such
a
broad
difference
between
what
can
be
recovered
in
a
criminal
proceeding
and
what
the
civil
proceeding
allows
in
terms
of
a
penalty
helps
underscore
that
the
civil
proceeding
does
have
a
different
purpose
and
a
different
effect.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
there...
there
are
other
statutes
where
congress
has
provided
different
kinds
of
formulas
to
attack
this
kind
of
wrongdoing.
there's
more
than
one
way
to
skin
a
cat
in
this
setting,
and
congress
has
provided
for
a
mandatory,
fixed-sum
penalty
in
this
act;
in
other
acts,
has
provided
for
more
discretion.
there
is
currently
discretion
between
$5,000
and
$10,000
under
the
false
claims
act.
but
congress
is
trying
to
do
what
it
can
to
come
up
with
adequate
methods
both
to
compensate
and
to
deter.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
under
the
false
claims
act
on
the
civil
side,
the
sentencing
commission
would
not
have
jurisdiction
over
it,
only
on
the
criminal
side.
amicus
argues
that
the
costs
of
investigation
in
this
case
were
relatively
small
because
the
fraud
was
relatively
simple.
the
record
in
the
civil
case
was
not
developed
on
the
question
of
what
sort
of
investigation
occurred.
but
the
record
in
the
criminal
case
shows
that
an
extensive
investigation
was
necessary
to
bring
this
episode
of
wrongdoing
to
light.
it's
not
a
simple
matter
of
looking
on
the
face
of
the
claim
form
and
determining
whether
or
not
there
was
a
fraud.
to
begin
with,
medicare
does
not...
and
its
fiscal
intermediaries
don't
even
review
each
form.
they
rely
on
an
honor
system.
but
more
fundamentally,
there
was
a
need
to
determine
whether
in
fact
the
services
were
performed
that
mr.
halper
claimed
he
had
performed
and
attempting
to
determine
the
magnitude
of
the
problem
because
the
government
is
not--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
civil
action's
costs
are
less
than
the
criminal
prosecution,
but
there
were
still
costs
of--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
to
establish
liability,
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
not
to
find
assets
which
is
a
problem
that
frequently
complicates
civil
actions
of
this
nature.
but
the
government
is
forced
to
devote
an
enormous
amount
of
resources
to
trying
to
figure
out
in
the
first
place
is
this
a
fraud.
is
it
a
fraud
that's
worth
prosecuting?
it
doesn't
prosecute
cases
that
involve
one
or
two
accidental
misstatements
on
a
medicare
form.
it
has
to
determine
whether--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
true,
your
honor,
and
the
government
has
never
been
compensated
for
that.
and
under
the
judgment
below,
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
sentencing
guidelines
are
not
structured
to
compensate
the
government
for
its
costs
of
investigation
and
prosecution.
they
simply
don't
work
that
way.
the
focus
of
the
criminal
episode
is
really
to
punish
the
defendant.
the
focus
of
this
kind
of
proceeding
is
to
ensure
that
the
government
is
compensated
for
the
problem
and
to
have
a
deterrent
mechanism
in
place
to
prevent
successive
types
of
frauds
like
this.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right,
your
honor,
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
prior
criminal--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
it
could
go
either
way
on
that
point.
we
believe
that
the
result
that
the
district
court
reached
in
this
case
would
require
each
court
to
speculate
in
each
case
about
what
the
government's
true
damages
were
before
it
could
decide
whether
the
false
claims
act
were
civil
or
criminal
in
a
given
setting
or,
alternatively,
it
would
force
the
government
to
attempt
to
quantify
exactly
how
much
it
had
spent
in
attorney
time,
how
much
it
had
spent
in
investigatory
time,
which
is
simply
not
a
process
that
can
reasonably
be
done.
it's
precisely
the
reason
why
liquidated
damages
are
provided
in
contracts.
this
is
not
a
direct...
it's
not
directly
identical
to
liquidated
damages
because
congress
is
legislating
for
a
broad
category
of
cases.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct,
but
costs
are
usually
a
very
small
component
of
the
actual
development
of
a
case
and
bringing
it
to
trial.
costs
that
are
recoverable
in
a
civil
action
are
really
limited
to
the
costs
that
you
incur.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
congress
did
not
specifically
itemize
those
kinds
of
issues.
it
did
rely--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
didn't...
it
mentioned
it
to
the
extent
that
it
alluded
to
the
hess
case
and
it
approved
of
the
rationale
of
the
hess
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
your
honor,
the...
court's
reasoning
did
not
rely
on
the
qui
tam
provision
in
that
setting.
