justice
byron
r.
white
was
there...
were
there
hearings
on
the
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
did...
was...
who
proposed
the
legislation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
your
transmittal
letters,
did
you
talk
about
costs?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
a
justice
department
representative
testify?
justice
byron
r.
white
anything
about
costs?
justice
byron
r.
white
while
i've
got
you
interrupted,
if
there
hadn't
been
a
criminal
proceeding
here,
i
suppose...
if
there
weren't
a
criminal
proceeding
in
this
case,
i
suppose
the
theory
of
the
district
court
would
mean
that
the
case
would
have
to
be
tried
as
a
crime...
as
a
criminal
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
so...
so...
so,
some...
you
would
have
to...
in
a
case
like
this,
you
would
have
to
decide
in
advance
what
might...
how
much
of
a
fine
might
be
determined
to
be
criminal?
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx.
is
there
any...
where
did
the
district
court
find
out,
if
it
did,
how
much
the
government's
expense
was
in
investigating?
it
said
even
adding
that
amount
to
the
government's
expense
of
investigating
and
prosecuting
the
statute,
the
total
amount
is
excessive.
how
did
it
know
what
it
cost
the
government?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he...
he
just
talked
about
investigation.
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
the
whole
criminal
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
can't
imagine
that
it
only
cost
the
government
$16,000
to
prosecute
the
criminal
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
started...
i
suppose
it
started
in
the...
in
another
department?
i
mean,
somebody
turned
it
over
to
justice,
didn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
wasn't
it
referred
to
justice
by
somebody
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
suppose
it
would,
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
know.
it
might
increase
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
it's
referred
to
the
justice
department
and
then
it
goes
to
the
u.s.
attorney?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
an
indictment
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
criminal
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
how
long
that
took?
justice
byron
r.
white
only...
only
one
government
attorney
before
the
grand
jury,
or
do
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
government
have
to
go
before
a
judge
during
the
grand
jury
proceeding
to...
for
some
rulings
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
did
he
say
this
was
a
criminal
prosecution?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i...
i
can't
imagine
why
you'd
come
out
differently
if
there
hadn't,
been
another
criminal...
if
there
hadn't
been
a
criminal
prosecution--
justice
byron
r.
white
--preceding
it.
it
would
still
be
a...
a...
the
government
seeking
a
disproportionate
fine,
and
he
would
say
this...
you
can't...
this
is
a
criminal
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
can't
imagine
that
he
would...
he
would...
he
would
say
you'll
have...
we
want
to
try
this
like
a
criminal
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you...
do
you
think
we'd
have
to
overrule
rex
trailer?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
but
it
also...
but
the
court
also
said
that
there
is
no
requirement,
statutory
or
judicial,
that
specific
damages
be
shown.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
should
we...
our
inquiry
here
is...
is
that
we
look
at
the
$132,000
and
try
to
speculate
what
the
government...
whether
the
government
spent
that
much
in
hew
and
everything
else?
it's
just
out
of
bounds.
justice
byron
r.
white
two
hundred
and
twenty
times
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
you...
this...
you...
can
the
government...
can
the
court
transform
a
criminal
proceeding
into
a
civil
one
just
by
reducing
the
fine?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
that's
a
double
jeopardy
solution,
but
it
still
was
a
criminal
prosecution.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you're
saying
we...
we
reduce
it...
we
can...
we
can
change
a
case
that
should
have
been
tried
as
a
criminal
case
into
a
civil
case
just
by
reducing
the
fine.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
hadn't
been
a...
if
there
weren't
a
prior
criminal
case,
you
wouldn't
say
that
the
government
could
collect
this
$132,000
in
a
civil
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't...
i
didn't
want
to...
what
would
be
your
answer?
would
they...
would
there--
justice
byron
r.
white
--wouldn't...
wouldn't
the
court
say,
well,
this
is
punishment
and
you
can't
collect
it?
