justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
district
court
set
the
amount
at
$16,000.
wasn't...
isn't
that
a
finding
of
fact
that
that's
the
reasonable
amount
of
the
government's
cost?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it...
it...
it
came
to
that
conclusion
by
eight
times
$2,000?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
there
any
rationale
given
for
the
eight
count...
for
the
figure
eight?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
suppose
you
could
say
that
the
government
knows
that
it's
always
a
civil
proceeding,
but
that
if
the
fine
is
shown
to
be
excessive,
it's
just
scaled
down.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
case
would
have
to
be
tried.
if
it
were
an
excessive
fine,
it
would
supposedly
have
to
have
been
tried
under
the
criminal
rules
and
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
things
like
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well...
well,
but
in
this
statute
i
take
it's
your
position
that
if
the
average
that
congress
somehow
sets
meets
some
rational
standard,
that
the
statute
can
never
be
criminally
applied
to
any
person
no
matter
how
excessive
it
is
in
his
individual
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
said
earlier
that
the
statute
could
be
unreasonable.
did
you
mean
in
the
amount
that
it
sets
on
the
face
of
the
statute
or
as
applied
to
the
particular
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
again,
so
that
it
follows
that
a
particular
statutory
penalty
can
never
be
criminally
punitive
as
to
some
persons,
but
not
as
to
others.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
suppose
the
city
is
injured
in
an
antitrust
action,
and
there's
a
criminal
antitrust
prosecution,
and
then
the
state
or
the
city
sues
and
gets
triple
damages.
is
that...
is
that
a
violation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so...
so,
in
your
view
antitrust
damages
under
the...
under
the
sherman
act,
when
the
city
is
injured,
cannot
be
tripled
automatically.
you
have
to...
there
has
to
be
a
showing
that
the
cost
of
investigation
is...
is...
is
reasonably
comprehended
within
the
triple
amount?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
is
their
rationale
for
triple
damages
under...
under
the
sherman
act?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's...
there's
a
large
deterrence
rationale
that
has
a
civil...
that
has
a
civil
consequence,
isn't
there?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
an
antitrust
suit's
triple
damages
can
be
astronomic
and
generally,
i...
i
would
assume,
are
well
in
excess
of
the
costs
of
investigation
and
prosecution.
you
get
attorney's
fees
in
addition,
don't
you,
under
the
antitrust
act?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you're
willing
to
make
your
case
here
rise
or
fall
on
the...
whether
or
not
triple
damages
can
be
granted
to
a
government
after
a
criminal
prosecution?
