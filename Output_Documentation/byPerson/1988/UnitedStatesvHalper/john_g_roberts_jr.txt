mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
after
punishing
mr.
halper
with
two
years
in
prison
and
a
$5,000
fine
for
his
$585
in
false
claims,
the
government
brought
a
second
proceeding
against
him
seeking
a
$130,000
penalty
for
those
same
false
claims.
the
district
court
correctly
concluded
that
this
would
be
punishing
halper
twice
for
the
same
offense,
in
violation
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
and
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
now,
the
government
does
not
dispute
that
the
second
proceeding
was
based
on
precisely
the
same
false
claims
for
which
halper
had
been
previously
convicted
and
punished.
indeed,
the
government
relied
exclusively
on
halper's
prior
criminal
conviction
to
establish
his
liability
in
the
second
action.
what
the
government
says
is
that
the
$130,000
penalty
should
not
be
regarded
as
a
second
punishment
because
it
served
a
remedial
purpose,
that
of
compensating
the
government
for
its
losses.
but
the
facts
belie
that
contention.
a
$130,000
recovery
cannot
be
dismissed
simply
as
compensation
for
$585
in
damages.
nor
is
the
answer
any
different
if
the
government's
costs
of
investigation
and
prosecution
are
factored
into
the
equation.
the
district
court,
which
was
intimately
familiar
with
the
details
of
halper's
fraud,
the
record
in
the
case
and
all
the
judicial
proceedings
concluded
that
$16,000
would
fully
compensate
the
government
for
all
its
costs.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
did
the
best
it
could
on
what
the
government
gave
it.
only
the
government
knows
how
much
it
cost
to
investigate
and
prosecute.
and
in
the
first
opinion
the
district
court
arrived
at
the
$16,000
figure
and
said--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
i
think
in...
in
any
particular
case
where
the
district--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
it
didn't.
in
its
first
opinion,
though,
it
challenged
the
government
to
come
up
with
some
evidence.
it
said
this
is
my
approximation.
he
did
use
that
word.
but
the
government
hasn't
given
me
any
evidence
of
the
expenses,
so
this
is
the
best
i
can
do.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
costs
of
investigation
and
prosecution.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
investigating
the
fraud.
it's
not
clear
to
me
whether
he--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
this
was
actually
a
fairly
easy
case.
this
is
not
a
complicated
fraud.
if
you
recall
the...
the
details,
you...
you
got
an
extra
$9
on
your
medicare
claim
for
the
first
patient
you
visited
at
a
facility.
and
halper
turned
in
invoices
listing
12
people
as
the
first
person
visited
that
day.
it
was
a
very
transparent
fraud,
very
easy
to
investigate
and
very
easy
to
prosecute.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
started
as
a...
as
a
criminal
investigation.
i
don't
know
if
there's--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i'm
not
aware
that
it...
it
was.
it
could
have
been
from
a...
from
a
medicare
fraud
unit
or
something.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
it
had
been,
i
would
suppose
that
would
reduce
even
further
the
costs
of
investigation
and
prosecution.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
they
have
a
set
unit
there
who
looked...
presumably
which
looks
at
the...
the
claims
that
are...
are
submitted
as
a...
as
a
routine...
that's
their...
their
job...
it
wouldn't
be
very
hard
to
pick
halper
out.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
and...
and
the
civil
side
of
the
case,
of
course,
was...
was...
was
open
and
shut.
it
was
collateral
estoppel
from
the
criminal
conviction.
there
was
no
need
to
put
on
any--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
i
think
as
an
initial
matter,
the
court
can
assume--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
i
think
it
would
really
only
come
into
play
when
you
have
a
disproportion
between
penalty
and
actual
damages
as
stark
as
it
is
in
this
case.
the
government
relies
on
the
hess
case.
there
the
penalty
recovery
equaled
the...
the
government's
loss.
here
it
was
220
times
the
government's
loss.
in
this
sort
of
case,
i
think
the
district
court
does
have
to
look
and
say
if
this
is
remedial,
show
me
how
this
compensates
you
for
loss
and
how
it--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
i
don't,
your
honor.
the
government
argues
today
that
we
shouldn't
concern
ourselves
with
what
the
facts
are
in
any
particular
case,
but
just,
as
they've
said,
if
it
works
out
well
enough
as
a
general
matter.
i
don't
think
that's
how
the
double
jeopardy
clause
works.
the
issue
is
the
rights
of
this
particular
defendant
in
this
particular
case,
and
it
doesn't
strike
me
as
an
adequate
answer
to
say
that
the
statutory
formula
works
out
well
enough
as
a
general
matter
in
the
average
case.
and
it
shouldn't
come
as
a
surprise
that
there
might
be
this
disproportion
between
recovery
and...
and
actual
loss
because
the
formula
for
calculating
that
recovery
bears
absolutely
no
relation
to
the
government's
loss.
it's
based
on
the
number
of
counts
in
the
complaint,
not
actual
damages
or
costs
of
investigation.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
it
cannot.
it...
it
can
be
maintained
up
to
the
$16,000
limit.
anything
beyond
that
is...
is
punishment
and
a
second
punishment
when
the
defendant
has
already
been--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
plus
the
actual
damages.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
is
play
at
the
joints,
and...
and
the
district
court
recognized
that
in
arriving
at
that
$16,000
figure,
it
did
have
to
take
into
account
the
difficulty
of
calculating
the
costs
and...
and...
and
the
damages.
and
he
expressly
did
that.
but
once--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
i
don't
think
the...
the
defendant
in
any
particular
case
has
to
pay
for
the
wasted
efforts
going
after
others.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
he
should
certainly
be
made
to
pay
for
the
costs
that
he
caused,
in
other
words,
the
time
spent
investigating
his
case.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
think
there's
a
point
at
which
the
rational
in
hess,
in
other
words,
compensating
the
government
for
its
losses...
there
has
to
be
a
point
at
which...
certainly
he
doesn't
have
to
pay
his
share
of
the
overhead
on
the...
on
the
national
debt.
these...
the
notion
of
the
costs
of
investigation
and
prosecution
is
not
a
novel
one.
in...
in
private
litigation,
indeed,
in
litigation
involving
the
government,
there
are
many
cases
where
they
are,
for
example,
claiming
attorney's
fees.
it's
fairly
routine.
you
submit
an
affidavit
from
the
prosecutor
detailing
the
costs
involved.
i
don't
think
it
need
go
much
beyond
that
in
this
sort
of
case,
including
the
costs
of
the...
the
investigation.
but
even
if
you...
you
regard
the
$16,000
figure
as
a
little
soft
i
terms
of--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--in
the
first
case,
yes.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
the
criminal
case,
yes.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
before
the
grand
jury?
no,
your
honor.
i
do
not.
again,
i...
i'd
just
reiterate
that
this...
this
is
not--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
indictment
was
signed
by
one
assistant
united
states
attorney.
i
suspect
this
is
the
sort
of
case
that
could
be
easily
handled
on
the
documents.
you
have
the
claims
saying
here
are
the
12
people,
each
of
whom
was
the
first
one
i
saw
on
this
particular
day.
it
struck
me
as...
as
a
fairly
routine
case
in
which
the
government's
estimate--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i'm
not
sure.
i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
they
can
just
go
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
five
grand
juries?
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
think
when
they
get
to
the
point...
in
a
case
that
shows
the
disproportion,
as
in
this
case,
220
times
the
actual
damages--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
and
not
all
the
time
of
the
one,
just...
just
the
time
spent
in
this
particular
case
because
the
issue
concerns
the
rights
of
this
particular
defendant
in
this
case.
and
i
don't
think
the
principle
that
you
can
average
out
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
one
that
this
court
has
accepted
in
the
past.
now,
under
the
government's
theory,
the
penalty
in
this
case
is
remedial
and
compensatory,
regardless
of
what
the
facts
show.
i've
pointed
out
the
facts
in
this
case,
which
i
think
are
stark
enough.
but
the
government
says
it
could
have
prosecuted
halper
under
the
amended
act,
in
which
case
his
minimum
penalty
would
have
been
$325,000
and
it
could
have
gone
up
to
$650,000.
a
defendant
who
filed
200
false
claims
of
$1
each
for
total
damages
to
the
government
of
$200
would
face
a
minimum
mandatory
penalty
of
$1
million.
and
still
the
government
would
say
that
that's
remedial
and
compensatory.
and
there's
no
reason
to
stop
there.
if
this
court
accepts
the
government's
theory,
congress
can
up
the
ante
and
raise
the
maximum
penalty
from
$10,000
to
$20,000
or
$100,000
or
$1
million.
there
is
nowhere
to
draw
the
line
under
the
government's
theory.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
only
issue
would
be
whether
it
violated
the
eighth
amendment,
the
excessive
fines
or
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
provision.
but
this
was
not
a
criminal
prosecution.
and
i
think,
justice
white,
in
response
to
one
of
your
earlier
questions,
the
district
court's
holding
isn't
necessarily
that
this
penalty
can
only
be
imposed
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
what
the
district
court
did
was
recognize
that
when
the
defendant
had
been
punished
once--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
he
did
say
this
was
a
criminal
penalty,
but
he--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
it
would
be--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that
may
be,
but
he--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
in
terms
of
the
holding,
i
think
it's
a
different
question
whether
this
on
its
face
is
a
criminal
prosecution
because,
after
all,
the
district
court
did
allow
the
proceeding
to
continue
to
the
extent
of
awarding
the
government
it
double
damages
and
all
the
costs
of
the...
of
the
prosecution.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
not
at
all.
in
rex
trailer,
this
court
simply
held
that
$10,000
was
reasonable
liquidated
damages
for
the
fraudulent
purchase
of
five
automobiles.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
the
court
specifically
noted
that
the
government,
while
it
had
not
shown
the
amount
of
its
damages,
it
didn't
doubt
that
the
government
had
been
injured,
and
it
was
simply
saying
liquidated
damages
of
$10,000
is
close
enough
in
this
case.
the
notion
of
permitting
the
recovery
as
liquidated
damages
is
the
same
notion
as
in
hess.
it
sets
a
ceiling.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's
not...
it's
not
speculation.
the
government
to...
when
the
disproportion
is
as
high
as
it
is
here,
220
times,
the
government
should
be...
has
the
burden
of
coming
forward
and
saying
this--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--times
its
actual
damages,
the
$585
in
false
claims.
and
the
government
has
the
burden
of
saying,
yes,
it
did
cost
us
this
much
and
here's
why.
otherwise,
the
justification
is
totally
divorced
from
the
facts.
they're
justifying
this
$130,000
penalty
as
remedial,
as
compensatory,
and
then
they're
saying
they
don't
care
if
in
any
particular
case
it
is
so.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
at
the
end
of
the
proceeding
after
liability
has
been
established
and
the
statutory
penalty
is
set,
if
there
is
a
disproportion,
in
this
case,
the
$130,000
versus
$585,
then
the
district
court
says
this
doesn't
look
like
compensation.
this
looks
like
punishment.
show
me
that
it's
actually
compensation.
and
the
district
court
did
that
in
this
case.
in
its
initial
opinion
it
said
my
approximation
is
$16,000.
the
government
hasn't
come
up
with
anything
to
show
me
i'm
wrong.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
absolutely.
it
can
just...
just
as...
as
in...
in
morris
v.
mathews
the
court,
confronted
with
the
proceeding
where
the
conviction
violated
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
reduced
the
penalty
to
a
non-barred
offense
and,
therefore,
said
that
was
acceptable.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
was
a
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
think
he's
saying
it
should
have
been
tried
as
a
criminal
case.
what
he's
saying
is
that
this
is
a
civil
case
and
it
can
be
brought,
but
only
so
long
as
you
don't
impose
punishment
a
second
time.
if
you
seek
a
recovery
beyond
the
damages
and
costs,
that's
punishment
and
since
the
defendant
has
already
been
punished,
he
can't
be
punished
a
second
time.
now,
the
government
has
a
fall-back
position
to
this
remedial
and
compensatory
rationale,
one
that's
flatly
inconsistent
with
it.
it
says
that
the
penalty
can
be
upheld
because
it
will
deter
future
false
claims
by
halper
and
others.
but
it
will
deter
by
punishing.
as
this
court
noted
in
bell
v.
wolfish,
deterrence
is
"not
a
legitimate
non-punitive
governmental
objective.
"
it's
a
punitive
objective.
the
catch
is,
of
course,
that
halper
has
already
been
punished
and
can't
be
punished
again.
the
government
relies
on
the
distinction
between
criminal
and
civil
proceedings.
it
says
that
it
can
punish
you
twice
in
successive
proceedings
so
long
as
in
one
of
those
proceedings
the
punishment
is
imposed
in
a
civil
forum.
initially,
i
think
there's
something
very
counter-intuitive
about
that
argument.
the
government
agrees
that
it
can't
punish
you
twice
in
two
successive
criminal
prosecutions,
in
each
of
which
the
defendant
would
enjoy
all
the
protections
of
criminal
due
process,
the
right
to
make
the
government
prove
its
case
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
the
right
to
call
and
confront
witnesses.
under
the
government's
theory
it
can
punish
you
twice
in
successive
proceedings
but
only
so
long
as
you
don't
have
those
protections
in
one
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
think
in
a
typical
civil
action
where
it
is
brought
by
a
private
party,
it
wouldn't
implicate
the
double
jeopardy
clause
at
all.
it
would
only
be...
only
come
into
play
if
the
government,
after
punishing
a
defendant,
sought
punitive
damages--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
would
be
enough
to
trigger
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
would
depend,
your
honor,
on
whether
the
triple
damages
exceeded
the
costs
of
investigating
and
prosecuting
the
violation.
i
think
the
same
analysis--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
the
only
rationale
that
can
be
advanced
on
the
facts
for
the
triple
damages
is
punitive,
punishment,
then
the
same
analysis
would
apply
because
the
defendant
would
already
have
been
punished--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--[inaudible].
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
so.
perhaps
they
could
be
justified
as
an
incentive
to
bring
these
sorts
of
suits,
but
i
think
in
most
cases
they
would
be
punitive,
and
this...
this
analysis
would
apply.
now,
it's
not
likely
to
present
problems
on
the
facts
because...
look
at
this
case,
for
example.
triple
damages
would
have
been
$1,755.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
under
the...
under
the
sherman
act.
i
suppose,
though,
as
the
damages
increased,
perhaps
the
costs
of
investigation
and
prosecution
of
the
antitrust
case
is,
of
course,
very...
unlike
this
one...
very
complex.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
analysis
does
apply.
there
may
be
a
difference
to
the
extent
that
the
formula
of
triple
damages
is
related
to
the
government's
loss
and
perhaps
in
that
sort
of
a
case,
congress
could
say
triple
damages
will
cover
the
costs
of
investigation
and
prosecution.
but
this
formula
is
completely
unrelated
to
the
government's
loss.
it's...
it's
$2,000
per
count
regardless
of
how
small
the
damage
or
how
great.
one
count
fraud
of
$1
million
gets
you
a
$2,000
penalty,
and
halper's
$585
in
false
claims,
of
course,
netted
him
a
hundred--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
in
that...
that's
true,
and
that
might
further
support
a
remedial
rationale.
i
know
in...
in
united
states
v.
ward,
for
example,
the
government
noted
that
the
penalty
that
was
assessed
went
into
a
revolving
fund
that
helped
clean
up
the...
the
oil
spills.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
is
a
qui
tam
provision--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--in
which--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
the
analysis
would
still
be
the
same.
the...
the
amount
the
government
sets--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
it...
it
may
be
distinguishable.
if
you
look
back
at
the
government's
brief
in
the
hess
case,
for
example,
they
had
no
doubt
that...
there
that
the
penalty
was,
in
essence,
criminal.
the
only
thing
they
were
concerned
about
was
whether
a
private
party
could
bring
this
suit
and
there
somehow
prevent
the
government
from
bringing
a
criminal
prosecution.
under
this--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
think
so,
and
i...
and
i
don't
think,
for
example,
it
would
apply
in
a
case
in
which
a
private
individual
brings
the
antitrust
action
after
a
government
prosecution
under
the
sherman
act.
and
the
current
statute
has
very
elaborate
protective
mechanisms
in
which
the
government
can
prevent
a
private
qui
tam
action
from
interfering
with
any
proceeding
it
may...
it
may
wish
to
bring.
the...
the
government--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
think
that
conclusion
follows
from
the
assumption
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
doesn't...
is
an
inhibition
on
government
action
and
doesn't
preclude
private
actions
for...
for
damages.
the...
the
government
relies--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
that's
right.
i
know
the...
the
court
has
the...
the
browning-ferris
case
coming
up
in
which
it
will
decide
whether
the
excessive
fines
provision
applies
to
private
actions.
but
i
don't
think
that's...
that's
implicated
here.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
the...
the
argument
i
think
in
the...
in
the
browning-ferris
case,
yes,
which
depending
on
how
it
comes
out,
would
make...
could
lead
to
a
curious
result
here.
if
the...
the
eighth
amendment
doesn't
apply
at
all
to
civil
proceedings,
then
there's
not
even
that
limit
on
the
extent
of
the
civil
punishment
the
government
can
impose.
and
if
it
does
apply
in
the
civil
proceeding,
then
the
government
presumably
would
say
that
this
isn't
punishment
until
it
becomes
excessive
punishment,
which
would
be
an
odd
result.
there
is
no
natural
cutoff.
my
brother
today
mentioned
that
there
will
come
a
point
at
which
the
recovery
may
be
so
excessive,
but
there's
no
logical
way
to
draw
that
point
other
than
the...
the
line
that
was
drawn
in
hess
and
in
rex
trailer
when
the
amount
exceeds
the
remedial
purpose.
when
it's
no
longer
compensatory,
then
it
is
a
second
punishment.
and
the
fact
that
it's
imposed
in
a
civil
forum
makes
no
difference
for
the
application
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
it
makes
no
difference
to
the
defendant
whether
this
$130,000
penalty,
the
second
punishment,
is
called
criminal
or
civil
because
he
has
already
been
criminally
convicted
of
the
underlying
offense.
the
government
refers
to
the
greater
stigma,
the
moral
condemnation,
that
attaches
to
a
criminal
punishment.
but
that
argument
simply
doesn't
work
in
this
case.
the
issue
is
not
whether
halper
is
going
to
be
stigmatized
or
morally
condemned.
we
know
the
answer
to
that.
he
is
for
precisely
these
same
false
claims.
the
issue
is
how
many
different
times
the
government
can
punish
him
as
a
result
of
that
moral
condemnation,
and
the
answer
in
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
once.
the
government's
focus
on
the
distinction
between
criminal
and
civil
is...
is
misdirected.
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
as
this
court
has
frequently
noted,
there
are
three
distinct
protections:
protects
against
a
second
prosecution
after
an
acquittal,
protects
against
a
second
prosecution
after
a
conviction,
and
it
protects
against
multiple
punishments
for
the
same
offense.
now,
when
the
first
two
of
those
protections
are
at
issue,
you
need
to
know
if
it's
a
prosecution.
is
this
an
inherently
criminal
proceeding?
but
when
the
third
protection
is
at
issue,
you
simply
need
to
know
if
it's
a
multiple
punishment,
if
he's
being
punished
a
second
time.
finally,
the
government
argues
for
reversal
with
a
parade
of...
of
horribles,
all
these
routine
civil
sanctions
after
a
conviction
that
will
supposedly
go
out
the
door
if
the
judgment
is
affirmed.
for
example,
it
cites
in
its
reply
brief
debarment
from
further
government
contracting,
loss
of
a
professional
license,
disbarment.
the
decision
below
will
not
at
all
threaten
those
routine
sanctions.
in
each
case,
those
sanctions
can
be
justified
with
reference
to
a
remedial
objective:
in
the
case
of
debarment,
maintaining
the
integrity
of
the
government
contracting
programs;
in
the
case
of
disbarment,
maintaining
public
confidence
in
the
integrity
of
the
bar.
here
there
is
no
remedial
justification
for
the
$130,000
penalty.
it
is
punishment
pure
and
simple.
finally,
the
decision
below
will
not
upset
the
government's
efforts
to
stamp
out
false
claims.
it
can
bring
a
criminal
action
and
get
what
are
now
very
high
fines,
up
to
$250,000
per
count,
and
then
later
bring
a
civil
proceeding
in
which
the
defendant
is
collaterally
estopped
to
collect
all
its
damages,
all
its
costs.
or
it
can
bring
the
civil
proceeding
separately.
i
don't
think
anything
in
the
holding
below
means
that
the
government
cannot
collect
this
penalty
in
a
civil
proceeding.
it
just
means
if
he
has
already
been
punished,
this
is
punishment
and
can't
be
brought--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
means
that.
the...
the
district
court
did
refer
to
this
as
a
criminal
penalty.
but
there's
nothing
in
the
logic
of
his
decision
that
says
you
can't
bring
this
alone.
the
key
to
his
conclusion
was
this
was
multiple
punishment.
this
was
a
second
punishment.
i
think
it's
a
very
different
question
whether
it
could
be
punished...
whether
you
could
be
punished
in
a
civil
forum
alone
without
the
prior
criminal
conviction
and
punishment.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
the
government
makes
that
argument.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i...
i
think
it...
it
may
well
have.
there's
nothing
in
the
decision--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--below
that...
you
don't
have
to
conclude
that
this
proceeding
is
inherently
criminal
to
recognize
that
it
does
impose
a
second
punishment.
the
second
punishment
is
enough
to
give
you
the
double
jeopardy
violation.
there
may
be
other
questions
to
consider
in
concluding
that
it's
an
inherently
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
would
be
a
very
different
question
because
you--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
think--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
think
that
would
be
a
very
reasonable
conclusion
on
the
facts,
given
the
disparity
between
recovery
and...
and
punishment.
but
it's
not
a
necessary
conclusion.
i
think
once
you
see
that
punishment
has
been
imposed,
the
double
jeopardy
analysis
is
at
an
end,
and
you
don't
have
to
go
further
and
say
is
this
criminal
punishment
or
is
it
civil
punishment.
the
government
says
that
it
could
have
sought
the
civil
penalty
in
the
same
proceeding
with
the
criminal
prosecution
and
then
says
why
can't
we
seek
them
separately.
i
think
that
conclusion
misses
the
entire
point
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
which
is
that
there
are
things
you
cannot
do
twice
that
you
can
do
once.
whether
the
government
could
have
sought
this
civil
penalty
together
with
the
criminal
fine
and
the
sentence
of
imprisonment
is
entirely
unrelated
to
the
question
of
whether
they
can
break
it
up
and
bring
this
additional
punishment,
punishment
which
follows
automatically
from
the
criminal
conviction
and
the
criminal
prosecution
in
a
separate
proceeding.
the
district
court's
decision
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
would
be
violated
by
the
excessive
punishment
was
correct
and
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
