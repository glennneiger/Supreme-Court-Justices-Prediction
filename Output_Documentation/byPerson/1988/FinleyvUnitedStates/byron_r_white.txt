justice
byron
r.
white
but
the...
except
for
the
federal
tort
claims
act
you
could
not
have
brought
in
this...
these
parties.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
and
you
could
not
have
gotten...
you
could
not
have
independently
sued
in
the
federal
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there's
no...
no
statute
about
it,
is
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
don't
think
there
is
any
article
iii
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all
the
parties
were
properly
before
the
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
that
it
may
be
possible
that...
that
the
liability,
the
extent
of
the
liability
the
united
states
might
be...
might
depend
on
your
claim
against
this
other...
this
other
party.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
the
united
states...
doesn't
the
united
states
implead
some
people
sometimes
when
they
are
sued
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know.
but
let's
assume
they
wanted
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
come
they
can
do
that
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
are
sued
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
then
how
do
they
get
another
party
into
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you...
i
don't
suppose
you
claim
that
if
the...
suppose
the
federal
tort
claims
act
was
just
dismissed?
and...
but
do
you
think
you
could...
even
though
they
had
jurisdiction
at
the
outset,
do
you
think
you
could
continue
your
suit
against
this
third
party?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's...
they
just
recognize
pendent-party
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
mr.
shapiro,
it
is
true,
isn't
it--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it
makes
any
difference,
mr.
shapiro,
that...
that
these
local
parties,
these
non-government
parties,
were
already
in
the
case?
they
had
been
sued
in
state
court
and
they
filed
indemnity
actions
against
the
united
states
in
the
same
court.
so
there
they
were.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
they
were
in
the
federal
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
that
may
be,
but
were
they
dismissed
on
that
ground?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
the
answer
is
they're
still
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
this...
was
the
state
court
action
ever
dismissed?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
was
there
just
a
stipulation
to
do
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
was,
why...
if
it
was,
the
indemnity
actions--
justice
byron
r.
white
--would
fall
with
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
united
states
had
sued
this
gas
company
in
this
very
action
for
indemnity
or
some
such
a
claim,
i
take
it
that
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
in
your
case
the
plaintiff
still
couldn't
sue
the
gas
company
in
the
federal
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
there
is
no
independent
federal
jurisdiction--
justice
byron
r.
white
--for
that
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
plaintiff...
if
the
plaintiff
here
had
been
a
resident
of
some
other
state,
she
could
have
sued
these--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
then
you'd
have
the
same
problem
before
the
district
judge,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
about
jury
trials
and
all
of
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
this
case
the
joinder
or
the
suit...
it
would
be
in
the
same
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
part
of
trying
out
the
claim
against
the
united
states,
is
trying
out
a
claim
against
a...
an
alleged
joint
tortfeasor.
