mr.
cook,
what
is
the
california
law
concerning
joint
and
several
liability--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--if
there
are
separate
trials
required?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
that's
exactly
the
claim
of
the
other
side,
and
they
bolster
that
by
saying
that
the
limited
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
in
the
federal
tort
claims
act
was
patterned
after
the
tucker
act
where
you
can't
bring
other
parties
in.
and
that
is
certainly
persuasive
evidence
of
what
congress
had
in
mind,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
true.
they
may
have
wanted
to
permit
plaintiffs
the
option
of
spreading
out
among
all
the
federal
district
courts
the
opportunity
to
hear
the
claims.
but
i'm
not
sure
that
answers
what
congress'
intent
was
with
regard
to
pendent-parties.
