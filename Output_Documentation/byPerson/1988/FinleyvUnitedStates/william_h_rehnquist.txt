chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
87-1973,
barbara
finley
versus
the
united
states.
mr.
cook,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
can
you
fail?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
talking
about
your
fear
of
inconsistent
verdicts
if
you
have
to
sue
the
state
defendants
in
superior
court
in
san
diego
and
the
united
states
in
the
district
court.
but
aren't
you
going
to
run
that
risk
in
a
consolidated
pendent-party
jurisdiction
case
in
the
district
court?
the
government
is
not...
you're
not
going
to
get
a
jury
trial
against
the
government.
do
you
waive
your
jury
trial
against
the
defendants?
if
you
get
a
jury
trial
against
them,
the
jury
can
come
in
with
a
different
result
than
the
judge,
can't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
do
you
manage
that
one?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
entitled
to
a
jury
under
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
your
client
would
have
to
in
effect
give
up
the
right
to
jury
trial
against
the
state
defendants
and...
if
you
have
pendent-party
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court,
would
she
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you
have
a
problem,
albeit
somewhat
lessened,
of
inconsistent
verdicts
even
if
pendent-party
jurisdiction
is
allowed,
do
you
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
is
a
problem
of
possible
inconsistent
jury
verdicts,
is
there
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
would
call
that--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that
would
be
my
idea
of
an
inconsistent
verdict.
is
it
not
yours?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
word...
but
the
words
"against
the
united
states"
is
not
broad.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--bring
same
tucker
act
claims
in
the
district
courts,
can't
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ten
thousand
and
less,
is
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then...
when
i
practiced
the
rules
said
you
could
implead
someone...
a
different...
could
implead
someone
who
you
claimed
was
liable
to
the
defendant.
but
you
couldn't
implead
someone
who
you
claimed
was
liable
to
the
plaintiff.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
would
think
the
theory
of
the
rule
was
that
the
plaintiff
would
not
have
any
claim
against
the
impleaded
defendant.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cook.
mr.
shapiro,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what,
again,
is
the
government's
position
on
the
indemnity
actions
filed
by
the
state
court
defendants,
mr.
shapiro?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
now,
what
if
the
state
court
action
had
gone
to
judgment
against
these
defendants?
then
do
you
agree
they
would
have
a
right
to
sue
for
indemnity
in
the
federal
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
yellow
cab.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
the
rule
provided
that
a
defendant
could
implead
a
third
party
defendant
only
on
the
basis
of
a
claimed
liability
over
to
the
defendant
and
not
because
the
third
party
defendant
might
be
liable
to
the
plaintiff.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
shapiro.
mr.
cook,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cook.
the
case
is
submitted.
