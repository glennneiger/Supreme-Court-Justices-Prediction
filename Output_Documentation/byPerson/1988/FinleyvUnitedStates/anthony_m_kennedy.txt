it's
not
probable
in
this
case,
or
in
most
cases,
but
are
you
aware
that
in
ayala
there
was
a
single
trial
with
two
judges?
a
state
judge
and
a
federal
judge?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems...
excuse
me...
it
seems,
counsel,
that
the
weakest
case
for
pendent
jurisdiction
is
where
the
jurisdictional
statute
is
framed
in
terms
of
parties.
here
the
only
reason
there
is
jurisdiction
is
because
there
is
a
party
statute.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
a
weaker
case
than
it
it
had
been
a
federal
question
case
under
1331.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
the
nature
of
the
defendant
that
confers
the
jurisdiction?
