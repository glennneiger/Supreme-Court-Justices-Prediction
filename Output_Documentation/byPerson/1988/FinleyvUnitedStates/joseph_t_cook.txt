mr.
joseph
t.
cook
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
question
of
whether
or
not
pendent-party
jurisdiction
may
be
exercised
when
the
anchor
jurisdiction
is
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
although
a
constitutional
question
is
presented
and
a
detailed
analysis
of
federal
jurisdictional
statutes
has
been
undertaken,
the
moving
force
behind
our
presence
here
in
the
court
today
is
logic,
reason,
common
sense,
and
judicial
economy.
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
i
was
hoping
it
would
work,
mr.
chief
justice.
[laughter]
in
responding
to
our
opening
brief,
the
united
states
seems
to
give
short-shift
to
what
are
considered
by
me
the
practical
reasons
for
recognizing
pendent-party
jurisdiction.
but
for
barbara
finley,
the
petitioner
here,
the
practical
reasons
are
the
only
reasons
that
count.
barbara
finley
seeks
one
trial
in
one
court
for
her
tort
claim
arising
from
the
loss
of
her
husband
and
her
two
daughters.
she
seeks
to
limit
her
own
financial
and
emotional
expenditures.
what
she
seeks
would
result
in
judicial
economy,
although
i
confess
that
that
was
not
what
she
asked
me
for
when
she
came
and
asked
me
to
represent
her.
most
significantly
to
her,
the
exercise
of
pendent-party
jurisdiction
in
this
case
would
eliminate
the
possibility
of
inconsistent
and
irreconcilable
verdicts
and
judgments.
one
from
the
state
court
and
another
one
from
the
federal
court
right
across
the
street.
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
justice
scalia--
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
--a
substantial
factor
in
a
diversity
case
where
there
is
incomplete
diversity
is
the
fact
that
the
claimant,
the
plaintiff,
has
the
option...
in
this
case,
barbara
finley
would
have
the
option
if
she
so
chose...
to
bring
all
of
the
actions
in
state
court.
she
could
get
everybody
in
front
of
one
jury
and
judge.
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
with
the
federal
tort
claims
act
as
the
anchor
jurisdiction,
and
absent
diversity,
as
diversity
is
not
present
here,
she
is
precluded
under
the
present
law
in
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
justice--
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
--well,
justice
scalia,
there
are
times
when
complete
diversity
may
not
work
for...
if
you've
got
a
multi-party
case.
there
are
times
when
that
may
arise.
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
well--
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
--that's
a...
that
is
a
different
problem
than
the
one
that's
posed
by
this
case.
this
is
a
case
where
the
anchor
jurisdiction
is
exclusive.
now,
there
may
be
cases
where
choices
have
to
be
made
at
the
outset
by
the
attorneys
representing
the
client.
but
in
a
case
where
there
is
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction,
i
don't
have
any
options
with
respect
to
the
united
states
as
a
defendant.
this
case
arises
from
an
airplane
accident
in
which
barbara
finley's
husband
and
two
daughters
were
killed.
they
were
passengers
in
the
airplane.
originally
suit
was
brought
in
state
court
in
san
diego
against
two
non-diverse
defendants,
the
city
of
san
diego
and
san
diego
gas
&
electric
company.
in
the
course
of
preliminary
discovery,
it
was
determined
that
the
runway
lighting
system
at
the
airport
in
question
which
had
been
charged
by
my
original
complaint
to
the
city
of
san
diego
as
the
operator
of
the
airport
was
operationally
maintained
and
managed
by
the
federal
aviation
administration,
the
united
states
of
america.
the
appropriate
procedures
for
a
federal
tort
claims
act
case
were
commenced,
and
a
separate
lawsuit
in
federal
court
against
the
united
states
was
brought,
literally
across
the
street
from
the
state
courthouse
in
san
diego.
a
motion
was
brought
in
the
federal
court
seeking
to
amend
the
federal
complaint
to
add
the
state
court
defendants
and
resting
upon
pendent-party
jurisdiction.
district
judge
schwartz
applied
the
gibbs
standards,
the
gibbs...
united
mine
workers
v.
gibbs
pendent
jurisdiction
standards,
exercised
his
discretion
in
that
regard,
acknowledged
the
ninth
circuit
prohibition
against
pendent-party
jurisdiction,
and
distinguished
the
existing
ninth
circuit
law,
granted
my
motion,
and
also
granted
the
government
a
28
u.s.
code
1292(b)
immediate
appeal.
the
ninth
circuit
summarily
reversed
on
the
grounds
of
its
longstanding
history
of
antipathy
towards
pendent-party
jurisdiction,
principally
set
forth
in
ayala,
the
ayala
decision,
and
we
sought
certiorari.
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
you've--
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
--the
california
voters
recently
passed...
recently,
two
years
ago
approximately...
two
and
a
half
years
ago...
passed
an
initiative,
proposition
51,
it
is
known
as...
which
has
thrown
the
question
you
asked,
justice
o'connor,
into
a
little
bit
of
confusion
right
now.
we're
still
waiting
for
some
supreme
court
decisions,
state
supreme
court
decisions.
but
basically
joint
and
several
liability
applies...
or,
comparative
liability,
i
really
should
say--
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
--to
all
joint
tortfeasors
in
california,
whether
they
are
named
as
defendants
or
not.
the
existing
jury
instruction
which
has...
under
the
new
proposition
51
which
has
not
been
tested
in
the
california
supreme
court,
makes
provision
for
the
jury
to
determine
the
liability,
the
percentage
of
liability
and
causation,
for
a
party
that's
not
even
named.
and
that
is
the
reason
that
we're
concerned
about
inconsistent
and
irreconcilable
differences...
or,
excuse
me,
verdicts...
in
this
case.
in
the
state
court
case
against
san
diego
gas
&
electric
and
the
city
of
san
diego,
it
could
and
probably
would
be
argued
that
we're
sorry
about
the
accident,
but
it's
all
the
fault
of
the
united
states.
so,
don't
hold
us
responsible.
and
two
weeks
later
or
two
months
later,
or
whatever,
in
federal
court
across
the
street
the
judge
hearing
the
federal
tort
claims
act
case
would
hear
from
the
government
that
the
fault
was
really
with
san
diego
gas
&
electric.
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
but
for
the
federal
tort
claims
act
i
could
not
have
sued
the
united
states.
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
that's
correct,
justice
white.
there
is
no
independent
basis
of
jurisdiction
in
federal
court
for
either
the
city
of
san
diego
or
san
diego
gas
&
electric.
the
only
way
to
do
it
is
the
reason
we're
here,
is
the
acknowledgement
of
the
propriety
of
pendent-party
jurisdiction.
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
there
is
no
statute
about
it.
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
well,
we...
i'm
prepared
to
discuss
that,
justice
white.
the
general
proposition
of
pendent
jurisdiction
is...
was
initially
or
perhaps
best
defined
in
the
united
mine
workers
v.
gibbs
case.
and
that
was
pendent
claim
jurisdiction,
not
pendent-party
jurisdiction.
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
correct.
but
the
parameters
or
factors
to
be
examined
by
the
district
court
judge
in
exercising
discretion
as
to
whether
or
not
that
new
claim,
the
state
court
claim,
should
be
brought
in
pendent
to
the
existing
federal
jurisdiction
were
set
forth
in
that
case.
subsequently
this
court
in
aldinger
v.
howard
addressed
the
question
of
pendent-party
jurisdiction.
in
that
case,
pendent-party
jurisdiction
was
not
found,
but
it
was
not
a
federal
tort
claims
act
case.
it
was
a
civil
rights
case
arising
under
28
u.s.
code
1343,
i
believe.
in
any
event,
in
the
course
of
the
aldinger
case
several
comments
were
made
which
are
instructive
here.
first
of
all,
it
was
recognized
that
there
are
some
circumstances
where
pendent-party
jurisdiction
may
be
appropriate.
one
of
which
was
where
jurisdiction
is
exclusive
in
the
federal
court,
such
as
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
that
was
clearly
dicta,
but
it
was
encouraging
to
me
when
i
read
it.
the
two
factors
that
the
aldinger
case
set
forth
in
determining
when
pendent-party
jurisdiction
might
be
appropriate
were,
first
of
all,
the
existence
or
absence
of
congressional...
constitutional
authority,
which
is
the
question
you
raised,
justice
white.
and
secondly
whether
or
not
the
anchor
federal
jurisdiction
negates
pendent-party
jurisdiction.
i
would
submit
that
where
the
federal
tort
claims
act
is
the
anchor
jurisdiction
and
the
united
states
government
is
the
defendant,
then
article
iii,
section
2,
clause
1
provides
ample
constitutional
grounds
for
the
exercise
of
pendent-party
jurisdiction.
that
particular
clause
provides
federal
judicial
power
in
controversies
in
which
the
united
states
shall
be
a
party.
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
the
united
states
is
clearly
a
party.
and
from
that
point
forward,
the
court
should
have
continuing
judicial
power
to
resolve
the
entire
tort
claim,
including
joint
tortfeasors.
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
chief
justice
rehnquist,
the
practical
procedural
problems
that
exist
under
the
scenario
that
i'm
seeking,
they
do
exist.
that's
true.
but
they
are
manageable
problems.
they
can
be
handled
by
counsel
and
by
the
court.
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
well,
if
i
may
give
an
example.
right
this
minute
in
los
angeles,
california
there
is
a
trial
ongoing
arising
from
a
midair
collision
in
los
angeles
in
which
the
united
states
government
is
in
as
pendent-party...
excuse
me,
as
federal
tort
claims
act.
an
airliner,
a
foreign
airliner,
is
in
on
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction
of
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act.
the
other
pilot
of
a
midair
collision
airplane
is
in
on
other
grounds.
there
is
an
advisory
jury
as
to
all.
the
judge
will
make
the
ultimate
determination
after
the
advisory
jury
renders
its
verdict
and
determines
whether
or
not
and
to
what
extent
to
accept
the
advisory
jury.
it
is...
it
is
not
as
simple
as
getting
everybody
in
a
state
court
in
front
of
a
jury
and
having
that
the
final
answer.
i'd
love
to
have
that.
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
you
are
not,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
the
proposition
that
i
would
make
to
district
judge
schwartz
in
this
case,
the
finley
case,
is
that
we
have
an
advisory
jury...
we
have
a
jury
as
to
the
state
defendants,
advisory
as
to
the
federal
government.
now,
judge
schwartz
may
say,
"no,
i
don't
want
to
do
that.
"
in
which
case
i
may
rethink
it
tactically
and
waive
jury.
that's
something
that
i
may
choose
to
do
after
discussions
with
the
court.
but
these
procedural
difficulties
exist
but
they're
not
insurmountable.
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
i
think
that
the
magnitude
of
the
problem
is
considerably
less.
there
is
a
problem
of
procedure,
but
i
don't--
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
--there
is
a...
there
is
a
problem
that
the
jury
could
come
in
with
one
verdict
and
the
judge
would--
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
--come
in
with--
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
--i
don't...
my
hope,
my
belief,
my
expectation
would
be
that
if
all
the
evidence
were
presented
to
the
jury
and
the
judge
in
the
same
courtroom
at
the
same
time,
that
the
inconsistencies
either
would
not
exist
or
would
be
minimal,
as
contrasted
with
the
situation
i
face
now
where
it's
presented
twice
in
two
different
courtrooms.
now,
i
concede,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
that
it
would
be
possible
for
a
judge,
reserving
to
himself
his
power
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
to
say,
"i'm
not
going
to
pay
any
attention
to
what
that
jury
says.
"
i
don't
think
that
that's
likely,
and
i'd
rather...
i
think
i've
got
a
better
chance
on
behalf
of
my
client
if
we're
all
in
the
same
courtroom
listening
to
the
same
evidence
at
the
same
time.
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
justice
kennedy,
i
am
not
aware
of
the
final
result
of
ayala,
and
i
was
not
aware
that
that
had
taken
place.
i
was
aware,
or
am
aware,
that
subsequent
to
the
decision
in
ayala
the
government
impleaded
some
of
the
non-diverse
nonfederal
defendants
and
removed
to
a
certain
extent
some
of
the
problems
that
are
in
my
case.
i'm
not
even
sure
impleador
by
the
federal
government
is
a
satisfactory
solution,
first
of
all,
because
it
puts
the
entire
conduct
of
the
litigation
in
the
hands
of
defendant
government.
and
i
think
on
behalf
of
my
client
i
should
be
able
to
represent
her
and
determine
who
the
proper
defendants
are
myself
rather
than
wait
at
the
beck
and
call
of
the
federal
government.
but
i
was
not
aware
of
how
they
handled
the
state
and
federal
difference.
that
would
be
instructive
if
i'm
not
successful
here
today.
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
the
anchor
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
tort
claims
act
negates
pendent-party
jurisdiction,
there
are
three
points
that
i
would
like
to
make.
the
first
point
is
that
the
language
of
the
jurisdictional
statute
in
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
28
u.s.
code
1346(b),
specifically
includes
broad
coverage.
the
language
provides
federal
courts
with
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
civil
actions...
and
i
underscore
the
word
"actions"...
on
claims
against
the
united
states.
the
word
"action"
is
broad,
i
would
submit.
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
but
it
provides
jurisdiction,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
to
the
entire
action,
which
includes
a
segment
against
the
united
states.
the
action
against
the
united
states
and
against
the
city
of
san
diego
and
against
san
diego
gas
&
electric.
the
jurisdiction
on
the
action
is
provided
by
the
statute.
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
well,
the
only
way
that
there
could
be
any
action,
including
a
claim
against
the
united
states,
is
if
there
were
a
claim
against
the
united
states
and...
but
it
does
not
limit
it
to
that
claim
and
that
claim
alone.
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
justice
o'connor,
the
comparisons
between
the
tucker
act...
or,
for
that
matter,
the
court
of
claims
jurisdictional
provisions
as
against
the
federal
tort
claims
act
were
discussed
in
some
length
in
the
yellow
cab
case
back
in
1951.
and
my
reading
of
the
yellow
cab
decision
by
this
court
suggests
that
the
comparisons
that
the
government
tries
to
make
now
between
the
tucker
act
and
the
tort
claims
act
were
not
well
received
at
that
time
and
they
ought
not
be
well
received
today.
if...
if
congress
had
wanted
to
establish
a
jurisdictional
pattern
or
system
similar
to
the
tucker
act
and
the
court
of
claims,
they
could
have
passed
a
court
of
torts
act
and
they
could
have
established
a
separate
legislative
court
to
handle
torts.
they
didn't
do
that.
and
it
brings
me--
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
--if
i
may
proceed
to
the
second
element,
which
is
beyond
the
word
"actions"
in
the
statute,
the
second
element
i
think
may
answer
that,
justice
o'connor.
one
of
the
reasons
i
submit
that
congress
wanted
to
spread
it
out
amongst
the
various
district
courts
is
the
scheme
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
provides
for
liability
of
the
united
states
as
a
private
party
in
like
or
similar
circumstances.
1346(b)
itself
says
where
the
united
states,
if
a
private
person
would
be
liable.
the
administrative
provisions,
the
administrative
claim
portion
at
2672
of
title
28
where
the
u.s.,
if
a
private
person
would
be
liable
to
the
claimant
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
tort
occurred.
and
most
significantly,
28
u.s.
code
2674,
which
describes
the
extent
of
united
states'
liability
says
in
the
same
manner
and
to
the
same
extent
as
a
private
individual
under
like
circumstances.
they
spread
it
out
to
the
district
courts
all
over
the
country
because
they
were
going
to
use
the
law
of
the
district
courts
all
over
the
country
because
they
wanted
the
united
states
to
be
liable,
like
people
all
over
the
country--
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
--and
that--
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
--ten...
well,
there
is
a--
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
--another
distinction,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
between
the
tucker
act,
the
court
of
claims
situation,
and
tort
claims
is
that
the
contractual
jurisdictional
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
involves
a
somewhat
narrow
and
distinct
body
of
federal
contractual
law.
it
has
to
do
with
contracts
with
the
government,
which
is
a
kind
of
a
specialized
and...
and
definable...
not
by
me,
i'm
not
a
contract
lawyer...
but
a
specialized
area.
whereas,
the
tort
claims
act
covers
the
entire
universe
of
torts.
and
it
covers
all
the
activities
of
the
government,
not
just
the
contractual
activities.
and
any
government
employee
acting
in
any
manner
within
the
course
and
scope
of
his
or
her
employment
can
generate
liability
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
by
acting
tortiously.
the
scheme
of
looking
to
local
private
personal
law
can
only
be
achieved
if
all
party
defendants
are
joined
together
in
one
forum
before
one
judge
and
one
jury.
that
way,
one
forum
can
decide
all
the
issues
of
liability,
causation,
including
contributory
negligence,
comparative
negligence,
contribution
amongst
joint
tortfeasors,
comparative
indemnity,
and
total
indemnity.
i've
already
addressed
briefly
proposition
51
in
this
case,
in
the
finley
case
in
california,
which
provides
the
allocation
of
liability
to
someone...
to
a
party
that's
not
even
before
the
court.
the
proposition
51
instruction
in
the
finley
case,
if
i'm
unsuccessful,
would
permit
the
jury
in
the
state
court
in
san
diego
to
decide
that
the
city
of
san
diego
is
ten
percent
at
fault,
and
san
diego
gas
&
electric
is
20
percent
at
fault,
and
the
united
states
of
american
are...
or,
the
pilot
is
20
percent
at
fault...
and
i'm
going
to
lose
my
math...
the
united
states
of
america
is
50
percent
at
fault.
and
that
could
happen
in
the
state
court.
and
that
is
not,
i
submit,
the
intention
of
the
drafters
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
in
providing
for
private
personal
liability
of
the
united
states.
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
justice
kennedy,
the
federal
tort
claims
act
does
identify
a
party.
and
in
their
brief,
the
united
states
dwells
on
that
to
some
extent.
i
would
submit
that
identifying
the
united
states
as
a
party,
as
a
single
party,
is
a
bit
of
an
oversimplification.
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
as
i've
already
stated,
provides
for
liability
of
all
of
the
governmental
activities
and
all
of
the
governmental
employees
of
the
entire
federal
government
in
a
whole
host
of
areas
of
tort.
it
does
identify
that
there
will
be
one
defendant,
and
that
defendant
will
be--
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
--well,
it's...
it's
the
nature
of
the
jurisdiction...
excuse
me,
the
nature
of
the
defendant
that
moved
congress,
i
would
submit,
to
create
jurisdiction.
but
it's
also
the
nature
of
the...
the
area
of
litigation,
the
tort
area,
and
the
private
person
law
aspect
of
it
that
moved
congress
to
want
to
include
all
of
the
joint
tortfeasor
responsibilities.
the
third
party
claims
which
have
already...
third
party
claims
against
the
united
states
under
the
yellow
cab
case.
third
party
claims
by
the
united
states.
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
the
extent
of
the
united
states'
liability
would
depend...
if
i
could
get
them
all
in
the
same
courtroom...
would
depend
upon
how
the
judge
and
the
jury
heard
the
evidence
and
decided
the
evidence.
and
that's
all
we
want.
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
justice
white,
they
do
that
sometimes
and
they
don't
do
that
sometimes.
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
they've
done
it.
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
well,
they
don't
do
it
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
they
do
that
under
the...
title--
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
--they
exercise
a
separate
jurisdictional
provision.
and
forgive
me
for
my...
detail
of
my
memory...
i
think
it's
28
u.s.
code
1335
or
45
that
permits
them
to
be
a
plaintiff.
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
so
they
act
as
a
third
party
plaintiff,
and
rule
14--
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
--of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure--
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
--let
them
implead
that
party.
so,
there's
a
separate
jurisdictional
avenue
for
them
to
do
it.
and
the
yellow
cab
case--
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
--from
this
court
permits
a...
a
defendant
that
i've
got
in,
for
example,
by
diversity--
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
--if
mrs.
finley
lived
in
a
different
state
and
had
sued
the
city
of
san
diego,
the
city...
and
i
did
it
in
federal
court
pursuant
to
diversity...
the
city
could
implead
the
united
states
of
america
under
the
yellow
cab
case.
it's
just
this
circumstance
in
the
ninth
circuit,
where
if
you
don't
have
diversity
and
it's
not
the
pleasure
of
the
united
states
to
implead,...
let
me
back
off
from
that.
i'm
not
even
sure
that
implead
by
the
united
states
solves
all
my
problems
because
if
the
united
states
decides
to
implead
the
city
of
san
diego
and
san
diego
gas
&
electric,
and
i'm
unsuccessful
in
my
case
against
the
u.s.,
then
the
other
two
defendants
go
away
because
i
don't
have
independent
jurisdiction
over
them.
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
justice
white,
i
answer
that
with
the
same
sort
of
discretionary
scheme
that
was
started
in
the
gibbs
case
and
which
was
on
a
slightly
different
issue.
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
i
think
the
court
has
the
power.
yes,
i
do,
justice
white.
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
that's
correct,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
and...
but
that's
used
by
defendants
in
saying
i'm
going
to
implead
someone
who
is
liable
to
me
because
it
was
really
their
liability
that
caused
this
problem,
and
i'm
going
to
get
stuck
for
it
because
there's
a
sympathetic
jury
out
there.
and
that's
been
a--
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
--the
plaintiff
would
not,
using
rule
14,
implead.
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
not
in
the
ninth
circuit--
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
--that
i'm
aware
of,
justice
stevens.
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
not
that
i'm
aware
of
in
the
ninth
circuit.
in
other
circuits,
the
fifth,
the
eleventh,
and
the
tenth,
this...
the
procedure
i'm
seeking
is
used
regularly
and
successfully,
and
it
does
not
create
the
parade
of
horribles.
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
they
recognize
the
exercise
of
pendent-party
jurisdiction
relying
on
aldinger.
i
want
to
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal,
so
i
would
like
to
close
with
this.
under
the
tests
established
in
aldinger,
pendent-party
jurisdiction
exists
when
the
federal
tort
claims
act
is
the
anchor.
district
court
judges
should
be
given
the
opportunity
to
apply
the
gibbs
factors
to
those
cases
and
to
decide
whether
or
not
pendent-party
jurisdiction
ought
to
be
utilized
in
any
given
case.
here
the
district
court
judge
decided
those
questions
favorably
to
mrs.
finley
and
the
ninth
circuit
summarily
reversed.
i
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
to
reinstate
the
lower
court
order
by
district
court
judge,
and
to
permit
mrs.
finley
to
go
on
with
her
lawsuit.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
it's
undoubted
that
the
weakest
portion
of
may
case
is
the
legislative
history
portion
of
the
case.
and
my
position
on
that,
our
position
on
that,
is
that
the
plain
language
of
the
act,
and
particularly
after
the...
the
amendment
in
1948...
the
plain
language
provides
for
anchor...
for
the
anchor
jurisdictional
statute
to
include
additional
parties
where
appropriate.
it
does
not
negate
pendent-party
jurisdiction.
secondly,
again,
looking
to
the
scheme
of
the
act,
the
private
person
state
law
scheme
of
the
act,
that
too
indicates
congress'
intent
to
make
the
united
states
liable
as
a
joint
tortfeasor
with
all
other
potential
parties.
and
we
would
submit
that
those
two
factors
make
the
legislative
history
from
back
in
'42
or
'45
or
'46
to
be
on
a
relative
basis
of
no
interest.
i
would
also
point
out
that
the...
there
is
an
inconsistency
within
the
legislative
history
itself.
it
says
that
the
united
states
is
to
be
liable
as
a
joint
tortfeasor
in
accordance
with
state
law.
then
it
says
there
can't
be
a
defendant
with
the
united
states,
and
that's
inconsistent.
they
can't
be
a
joint
tortfeasor
in
accordance
with
state
law
if
there's
not
another
joint
tortfeasor
in
the
lawsuit
with
them.
it's
an
inconsistent
statement
within
the
legislative
history
itself.
mr.
joseph
t.
cook
if
there
are
joint
tortfeasors,
they
all
should
be
in
the
same...
the
same
lawsuit,
justice
white.
mention
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
both
gibbs
and
aldinger
refer
to
the
federal
rules
recognizing
that
they
don't
grant
jurisdiction,
but
the
scheme
of
the
federal
rules
is
let's
get
it
all
together,
let's
get
it
all
tried,
let's
get
it
all
taken
care
of.
the
federal
rules
promote
that.
they
suggest
that.
they
support
what
we
are
seeking
here
today.
the
comment
was
made
that
this
action
can't
be
tried
with
the
actions
against
the
other
defendants
because
it
wouldn't
be
a
state
law
or
state...
a
state
law
action.
the
action
against
the
united
states
in
the
1346(b)
is
a
state
law
action.
it
depends
on
the
state
law
of
the
place
where
the
act
or
omission
occurred.
so,
it
is
a
state
law
action,
it
just
includes
the
united
states
as
a
defendant.
the
efficiencies
and
the
absence
of
any
real
efficiencies,
i
don't
know
how
to
respond
to
that
other
than
experientially.
but
my
experience
in
a
number
of
cases
where
the
united
states
and
private
defendants
were
joined
for
various
reasons...
either
out
of
the
ninth
circuit
where
pendent-party
jurisdiction
was
acceptable,
or
in
the
ninth
circuit
were
other
jurisdictional
provisions
applied
such
as
diversity...
those
procedural
problems
were
all
dealt
with,
they
were
all
handled.
i've
never
seen
a
case
involving
a
single
action
with
multiple
defendants
tried
twice
in
a
federal
court.
we've
always
worked
out
ways
to
solve
the
jury
problem.
we
submit
the
ninth
circuit
should
be
reversed
and
the
other
circuit
should
be
followed.
thank
you.
