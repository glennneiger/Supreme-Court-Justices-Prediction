why
wouldn't
that
be
the
case
with
respect
to
diversity
jurisdiction
as
well?
where--
justice
antonin
scalia
--where
there's
not
complete
diversity
but
you
want
to
get
everybody
together?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
all
the
defendants
always
suable
in
one
state?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understood
that,
you
know,
very
often
you
want
to
bring
a
diversity
action
because
you've
got
plaintiffs
all
over
the
place...
or,
defendants
all
over
the
place.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
get
them
all
in
state
court
either--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
some
of
them
are
not...
are
not
reachable
there.
