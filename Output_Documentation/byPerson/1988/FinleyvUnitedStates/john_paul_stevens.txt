justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
in
these
federal
tort
claims
act
cases
where
the
government
brings
in
a
third
party
defendant
aren't
there
cases
in
which
the
plaintiff
gets
judgment
against
the
third
party
defendant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
you
must
look
at
legislative
history
to
make
this
point.
because
if
one
just
looks
at
the
language
of
the
statute
in
its
preexisting
form,
it
would
not
have
covered
a
suit
in
which
these
two
private
parties
are
also
defendants.
but
in
plain
language
now
it
does
cover
it.
because
even
if
they
were
joined,
it
would
remain
an
action
on
a
claim
against
the
united
states
and
they
would
be
then
parties
to
that
action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--is
a
civil
action
on
a
claim
against
the
united
states
no
matter
how
many
parties
there
are
to
the
action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
the
plain
language
is
dead
against
you.
but
i
understand
your
history
argument.
now,
the
question
i
just...
for
some
of
us
it
makes
a
difference
whether
you
have
to
go
beyond
the
plain
language
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
you
just
compare
it
with
the
earlier
version,
one
could
say
well,
the
change
was
intended
to
make
some
difference,
and
ergo,
it's
a
different
rule
now
than
it
was
before.
that
always
cuts
both
ways.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
shapiro,
refresh
my
recollection,
if
you
would.
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
were
adopted
in
1948,
was
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
ch,
'38.
okay.
'34.
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
judicial
code
was...
that's
right.
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
shapiro,
what
has
all
that
got
to
do
with
this
case?
none
of
those
problems
exist
in
this
case
or--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
most
of
these
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
of
course,
none
of
it
would
if
you
can't--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--sue
those
parties.
but,
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
all
follows
from
whether
they
can
be
made
parties
or
not.
i
don't
see
how
it
complicates
or
changes
the
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
see
how
it
could
prejudice
the
interests
of
the
united
states
if
the
plaintiff
is
saying
these
people
are
so
outrageously
negligent
that
they
should
be
held
liable
for
punitive
damages.
i
just
don't
understand
the
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
can
also
happen
if
the
united
states
should
bring
them
in,
which
i
suppose
it
could
have
done
in
this
case,
or
if
they
get
in
on
their
own
motion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
strange
thing
about
it
is
that
there
are
two...
the
private
defendants
can
get
in
and
the
federal
defendant
can
bring
them
in,
but
the
plaintiff
is
the
only
person
who
can't
bring
them
in.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
still--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
it
still
remains
just
an
action
on
the
claim...
or,
an
action
on
the
claim
against
the
united
states
even
though
they
are
brought
in
in
that
fashion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
the
1345
wasn't
enacted
for
this
purpose.
i
suppose
this
is
a
kind
of
a
by-product
of
that...
that
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
within
the
meaning
of
that
statute,
we
treat
the
third
party
claim
there
as
an
action
commenced
by
the
united
states
even
though
the
action
had
really
been
commenced
by
the
private
parties
sometimes
earlier...
sometime
earlier.
