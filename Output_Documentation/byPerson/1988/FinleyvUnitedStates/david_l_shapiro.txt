mr.
david
l.
shapiro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are,
we
submit,
three
basic
points
that
need
to
be
stressed
in
the
consideration
of
this
case.
first,
federal
subject
matter
jurisdiction
depends
not
only
on
a
source
of
authority
under
article
iii
of
the
constitution,
but
also
on
a
specific
statutory
grant
of
authority
in
an
act
of
congress.
in
the
context
of
pendent-party
jurisdiction
this
court
made
it
clear
in
aldinger
against
howard
that
the
question
is
whether
the
governing
statute
expressly
or
by
implication
negates
an
existence
or
negates
the
existence
of
pendent-party
jurisdiction
in
the
particular
case.
second,
when
we
look
at
the
relevant
statute
in
this
case,
section
1346(b),
the
tort
claims
act
jurisdictional
provision,
we
find
that
the
statute
does
indeed
negate
pendent-party
jurisdiction.
it
does
so
both,
in
our
view,
because
of
the
clear
statutory
language
which
is
limited
to
the
existence
of
jurisdiction
for
claims
against
the
united
states
and
because
any
doubts
about
the
meaning
of
that
language
are,
we
submit,
resolved
by
the
very
specific
legislative
history
which
makes
it
clear
that
joinder
of
other
codefendants
is
not
contemplated
as
being
within
the
scope
of
this
jurisdictional
grant.
third,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
has
placed
great
emphasis
on
claims
of
convenience
and
judicial
economy
as
being
a
basis
for
pendent-party
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
we
submit
that
even
where
those
claims
as
strong
as
petitioner
makes
them
out,
they
cannot
supply
subject
matter
jurisdiction
where
the
statutes
in
point
do
not
confer
it.
but
to
the
extent
that
the
statutes
themselves
may
create
any
doubt,
we
submit
that
the
claims
of
convenience
and
economy
in
petitioner's
brief
and
at
argument
here
today
are
very
much
overstated,
that
the
fact
is
that
very
significant
differences
between
tort
claims
litigation
against
the
united
states
and
ordinary
state
law
litigation
against
private
parties
are
so
great
that
these
claims
of
efficiency
and
economy
are
very
unlikely
to
be
realized,
and
that
indeed
if
pendent-party
jurisdiction
were
recognized
here,
the
cost
to
the
federal
system
might
be
very
great
without
any
corresponding
gains
to
the
state
courts
where
these
controversies
in
our
view
belong.
on
the
first
of
these
points,
that
is,
the
necessity
of
looking
to
the
governing
statute,
i
don't
think
there
is
much
need
to
spend
a
great
deal
of
time.
this
court
has
made
it
clear
repeatedly
in
cases
like
aldinger
and
others
that
statutory
authority
for
jurisdiction
must
be
found
and
the
petitioner
concedes
that
that
is
the
question
here.
we
would
emphasize
only
that
in
this
context
the
question
that
we
should
take
to
this
statute
is
whether
the
statute
has
addressed
the
party
against
whom
an
action
may
be
brought.
in
this
case,
the
tort
claims
act
section
1346(b)
has
done
exactly
that.
as
the
statute
was
originally
enacted
in
1946,
it
conferred
jurisdiction
on
the
district
courts
to
hear,
determine,
and
render
judgment
on
any
claim
against
the
united
states.
now,
this
court
held
in
the
yellow
cab
case
that
the
phrase
"claim
against
the
united
states"
must
be
broadly
construed
to
encompass
any
claim
against
the
united
states
in
tort,
including
third
party
claims
for
contribution
or
indemnity.
but
in
this
case
petitioner
is
asking
us
to
read
that
language
as
if
it
meant
claims
not
only
against
the
united
states
but
against
nonfederal
governmental
parties
as
well,
and
we
submit
the
language
simply
does
not
admit
that
construction,
particularly
in
the
context
of
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
which
is
what
the
tort
claims
act
itself
involved.
there
was
a
minor
change
of
wording
in
the
tort
claims
act
in
1948.
as
part
of
the
revision
of
the
title
and
the
codification
of
it
into
positive
law,
the
revisers
changed
the
language
so
that
the
district
courts
were
given
jurisdiction
of
civil
actions
on
claims
against
the
united
states.
we
submit
that
this
minor
change
in
wording
accomplished
no
effect
in
terms
of
the
jurisdictional
scope
of
the
act.
and
we
believe
that
is
true
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
we
don't
think
the
words
themselves
accommodate
any
different
reading.
we
believe
it
is
still
true
that
the
most
natural
reading
is
that
the
grant
of
jurisdiction
is
confined
to
the
entertainment
of
claims
against
the
united
states.
second,
this
particular
change
was
part
of
a
very
thoroughgoing
revision
of
title
28
of
the
u.s.
code,
and
the
revisers
in
the
course
of
their
revision
took
great
pains
to
note
any
changes
in
wording
that
were
intended
to
accomplish
significant
changes
in
substantive
outcome.
for
example,
in
the
removal
provisions
of
1441(c),
the
revisers
said
that
the
change
in
language
from
separable
controversy
to
separate
and
independent
controversy
was
intended
to
achieve
a
significant
result.
no
such
comment
was
made
here--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--by
the
revisers.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
your
honor,
i
don't
think
the
language
of
the
1948
revision
is
as
clear
as
the
original
language
of
the
1948...
'46
statute.
however,
i
think
the
language
of
the
1948
revision
by
itself
does
support
the
result
that
we
are
advocating
because
it
does
not
say
civil
actions
involving
claims
against
the
united
states--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--which
would
be--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--but
i
think--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--your
honor,
i
think...
i
think
we
could
rest
our
case
on
the
language
of
the
'48
statute.
but
i
think
our
case
is
greatly
strengthened
by
two
things.
one
is
it's
earlier
version
in
1946
and
the
other
is
the
legislative
history
of
the
tort
claims
act.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
we
think
there
are
really
two
reasons
in
addition
to
the
problematic
character
of
the
language
itself
why
the
'48
change
was
not
intended
to
make
any...
not
intended
to
make
any
revision.
one
is,
as
i
say,
the
revisers
took
pains
to
spell
out
where
a
change
was
intended,
and
this
would
have
been
a
rather
dramatic
change
to
be
making.
secondly,
the
use
of
the
words
i.e.,
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
rule
2
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
which
said
there
shall
be
one
form
of
action
known
as
the
civil
action.
throughout
the
revision
of
the
judicial
code,
the
revisers
incorporated
references
to
civil
action
to
distinguish
them
from
the
criminal
actions
that
were
also
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
courts.
we
acknowledge
that
the
language
of
the
'48
revision
is
somewhat
broader,
although
we
think
it
too
sustains
our
result.
we
think
it
is
consistent
with
the
'46
version
both
because
no
change
in
substance
was
intended
by
the
revisers
and
because
the
legislative
history
of
the
tort
claims
act
in
1946
is
very
clear.
to
understand
that
legislative
history
it
is
necessary
to
understand
the
case
of
united
states
against
sherwood
which
was
decided
in
1941,
only
a
few
years
before
the
tort
claims
act
was
passed.
united
states
against
sherwood
was
an
action
under
the
tucker
act
in
the
district
court
against
the
united
states.
it
was
brought
by
a
judgment
creditor
for
the
purpose
of
enforcing
a
contract
right
of
his
judgment
debtor
against
the
united
states.
as
required
by
new
york
law,
the
judgment
creditor
sought
to
join
the
judgment
debtor
as
a
codefendant
against
the
united
states.
and
it
appeared
that
that
joinder
was
required
in
order
for
the
action
to
go
forward.
this
court
held
that
the
jurisdiction
conferred
on
the
district
courts
by
the
tucker
act
was
not
broad
enough
to
encompass
the
joinder
of
that
private
defendant.
the
court
said
that
congress'
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
with
respect
to
the
tucker
act
was
no
broader
in
the
district
court
than
it
was
in
the
court
of
claims
and
that
did
not
admit
of
an
action
against
a
private
codefendant.
now,
we
do
not
contend
that
standing
by
itself
sherwood
governs
this
case.
this
case
is
different
in
several
respects.
it's
different
because
we're
dealing
with
the
tort
claims
act
rather
than
the
tucker
act.
it's
different
because
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
is
not
the
mirror
image
tied
into
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
claims.
what
makes
united
states
against
sherwood
so
relevant
here
is
that
in
drafting
the
tort
claims
act
congress
was
very
much
aware
of
the
decision
and,
we
think
it
is
clear,
intended
the
very
same
limitation
to
exist
with
respect
to
the
tort
claims
act.
in
1942
in
the
first
major
version
of
what
became
the
tort
claims
act
the
house
report
on
their
version
of
the
tucker
act
cited
the
sherwood
case
and
went
on
to
say
that
the
intention
of
the
tort
claims
act
was
identical.
the
bill
does
not
permit
any
person
to
be
joined
as
a
defendant
with
the
united
states.
after
that,
the
house
report
goes
on
to
discuss
the
point
raised
by
petitioner
in
her
reply
brief
to
say
that
the
liability
of
the
united
states
as
a
joint
tortfeasor
would
be
determined
by
state
law.
but
then
it
goes
it
goes
on
to
say,
however,
as
noted
before,
no
person
may
be
joined
with
the
united
states
as
a
defendant.
the
language
in
the
1942
house
report
was
repeated
in
the
1945
house
report
of
the
very
bill
that
did
become
the
tort
claims
act
in
l946.
and
so
we
contend
there
can
be
very
little
doubt
that
congress
intended
a
limited
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
did
not
intend
to
authorize
suits
both
against
the
united
states
and
private
codefendants
on
the--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--your
honor,
they
were
in
state
court.
after
the
state
court
action
was
filed
each
of
those
defendants
did
file
a
separate
indemnity
action
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
they
were
in
the
federal
court
but
only
very
problematically
because
the
united
states
in
both
actions
filed
motions
to
dismiss
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
no
case
or
controversy.
the
united
states
has
taken
the
position
in
those
indemnity
actions
that--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--that
an
indemnity
action
will
not
lie
until
and
unless--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--the
district
judge
has
stayed
the
motion
to
dismiss
until
the
resolution
of--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--they're
there
only
because
the
motion
has
not
been
ruled
on,
pending
the
outcome
of
this
case.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
i
believe
the
state--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--i'm
not
certain,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
state
court
action
was
dismissed,
but
basically--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--the
indemnity
actions
would--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--fall
unless
this
court
were
to
reverse
and
uphold
pendent-party
jurisdiction.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
the
government's
action
on
the
opposition
in
those
indemnity
actions
is
that
an...
an
independent
action
for
indemnity
or
contribution
may
not
be
brought
until
there
is
an
underlying
judgment
of
liability.
and
the
government's
position,
which
has
been
supported
with
considerable
authority,
is
one
on
which
a
motion
to
dismiss
is
now
pending
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
assuming
they've
got
underlying
legal
basis
for
a
claim
of
indemnity
or
contribution,
yes,
sir,
under
the
tort
claims
act.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
yes,
it
is.
the
legislative
history,
as
i
was
suggesting,
in
1945,
in
our
view,
leaves
no
doubt
that
it
was
not
the
purpose
of
the
tort
claims
jurisdictional
provision
to
allow
joinder
of
a
codefendant
in
a
suit
against
the
united
states.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
'38,
sir.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
well,
they
were
effective
in
'38.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
i
would
like
to
address
briefly
the
arguments
that
have
been
made
and
have
been
dealt
with
here,
oral
argument
by
petitioner,
for
the
position
that
allowing
pendent-party
jurisdiction
in
this
case
would
achieve
considerable
economies
and
efficiency,
and
that
perhaps
primarily,
if
not
exclusively,
for
that
reason,
this
court
should
recognize
pendent-party
jurisdiction.
as
i
said
at
the
outset,
we
contend
very
strongly
that
those
arguments
cannot
supply
a
basis
of
jurisdiction
if
authority
for
the
exercise
of
that
jurisdiction
cannot
be
found
in
a
governing
statute.
but
we
contend
also
very
strongly
that
the
petitioner's
position
on
questions
of
efficiency
and
economy
is
grossly
overstated,
that
in
fact
there
are
so
many
differences
between
a
tort
claims
action
against
the
united
states
and
a
state
law
action
against
a
nonfederal
defendant
that
these
efficiencies
are
very
likely
not
to
be
achieved.
i
would
like
just
to
refer
briefly
to
a
few
of
the
major
differences.
with
respect
to
a
tort
claims
action
against
the
united
states,
there
must
first
be
an
administrative
claim
filed.
secondly,
there
is
a
separate
statute
of
limitations
for
that.
it
must
be
done
within
two
years.
action
against
the
united
states
must
be
brought
within
six
months
of
the
denial
of
the
claim.
liability
of
the
united
states
can
be
based
only
on
negligence
or
wrongful
conduct.
it
cannot
be
based
on
contract
unless
an
action
can
be
brought
under
the
tucker
act.
it
cannot
be
based
on
a
theory
of
strict
liability.
it
cannot
be
based
on
a
variety
of
tort
claims
that
i--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--two--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--two
of
the
problems
that
i
think
exist
as
potential
problems
in
any
case
do
exist
here.
a
number
of
problems
that
do
not
exist
here
might
well
exist
in
situations
where
the
plaintiff
is
alleging
not
only
tort
liability
on
behalf
of
the
private
defendants
but
some
kind
of
strict
liability
in
a
product
liability
case
or
some
kind
of
contractual
liability
on
a
breach
of
word
theory.
so
that
there
would
be
a
number
of
issues
to
be
tried
in
the
federal
court
that
would
clearly
not
be
subject
to
trial
in
an
action
on
the
tort
claims
act.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
in
this--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--well,
what
we're
suggesting,
your
honor,
is
that
if
pendent-party
jurisdiction
were
upheld
in
a
case
like
this,
first
of
all,
there
would
be
two
immediate
problems
in
this
very
case,
one
of
which
is
that
the
plaintiff
has
alleged
a
claim
for
punitive
damages
against
the
nonfederal
defendants.
and
that
would
presumably
have
to
be
tried
at
a
federal
court.
additional
issues
to
be
tried
that
could
not
be
tried
against
the
united
states
and
which,
indeed,
if
they
were
tried
in
the
same
trial,
might
be
thought
in
some
ways
perhaps
to
prejudice
the
interests
of
the
united
states.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
i
think
the
argument,
your
honor
is--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--the
united
states--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--yes.
but
i
think
there
are
reasons,
not
only
of
the
technicality
of
the
jurisdictional
statutes,
but--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--in
the
policies--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--i
think
the
decision
of
the
united
states
to
allege
a
third
party
claim
in
many
situations
is
likely
to
be
governed
by
the
concern
of
the
united
states
that
in
doing
so
they
may
be
bringing
into
the
case
a
lot
of
issues
that
they
would
rather
not
have
there.
and,
of
course,
the
united
states
always
retains
an
option
to
bring
in
a
debated
action
for
indemnity
or
contribution
at
a
later
stage
if
it
feels
that
asserting
a
third
party
claim
would
needlessly
complicate
the
issues.
the
jurisdictional
statues,
we
contend,
each
one
does
have
a
significant
policy
jurisdiction.
the
ability
of
the
united
states--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--the
underlying
justification
for
1345
is
that
the
united
states
should
be
able
to
resort
to
federal
courts
for
the
vindication
of
its
own
interests,
rather
than
to
subject
itself
to
possible
bias
or
unfair
treatment
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
yes.
although
i'm
not
certain
there's
any
supreme
court
decision
squarely
at
point.
i
think
the
lower
courts
have
virtually
unanimously...
not
quite
unanimously
but
almost
unanimously
said
that
1345
allows
not
only
an
independent
action
by
the
united
states
for
indemnity
but
the
assertion
of
a
third
party
claim
in
a
tort
claims
case.
and
we
certainly
agree
with
that
interpretation
of
1345.
but
there
is
no
comparable
jurisdictional
provision
here.
certainly
not
1346(b)
which
authorizes
the
bringing
of
a
state
law
action
against
a
non-diverse
defendant
simply
because
there
is
pending
in
the
federal
courts
a
tort
claims
action
against
the
united
states.
and
we
believe
to
read
1346(b)
to
authorize
that
would
lead
to
the
ejection,
potentially,
of
a
whole
variety
of
issues
into
a
federal
court
that
would
not
otherwise
be
there.
in
this
very
case
one
of
those
issues
is
punitive
damages.
also
in
this
very
case
the
plaintiffs
have...
the
plaintiff
has
demanded
a
jury
trial.
so
that
what
would
otherwise
not
be
a
jury
trial
with
all
the
procedural
and
other
advantages
that
that
has
for
litigating
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
would
either
be
converted
into
a
kind
of
dual
trial,
a
jury
trial
at
a
non-jury
trial,
or
perhaps
because
of
that
very
problem
the
judge
might
find
it
necessary,
even
if
the
cases
were
one
case,
to
separate
the
two
out
for
trial
and
to
have
a
non-jury
trial
of
the
tort
claims
action
and
a
jury
trial
of
the
independent
state
law
action.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
the
only
situation
where
i
think
the
plaintiff
might
be
able,
as
a
result
of
existing
jurisdictional
statutes,
to
make
a
claim
directly
against
these
defendants
would
be
if
the
united
states
were
to
implead
them
as
third
party
defendants
in
this
action.
in
that
case,
we
took
the
position
in
ayala
that
the
plaintiff
could
make
a
claim
directly
against
the
third
party
defendants.
after
kroger
that's
not
so
clear.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
well,
that's
true,
your
honor.
but
rule
14
does
specifically
say
that
if
you
have
properly
impleaded
a
third
party
defendant
on
the
basis
of
a
right
to
contribution
or
indemnity,
that
at
that
point
the
plaintiff
may
assert
any
claim
she
has
against
the
third
party
defendant.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
well--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--of
course,
that...
in
kroger
that
was
held
to
be
a
barrier
to
the
assertion
of
the
claim.
whether
it
would
also
be
a
barrier
in
this
case
is
not
an
issue
that's
presented
here.
we're
not
sure
of
the
answer
to
that.
it
may
or
may
not
be
the
case.
but
that
would
only
happen
if
there
were
a
specific
decision
by
the
united
states
that
in
view
of
its
interests,
in
view
of
the
institutional
interests
of
both
the
united
states
and
the
federal
courts,
it
made
sense
to
implead
those
parties
as
third
party
defendants.
once
that
were
done,
i
think
there
would
be
a
very
strong
argument
for
allowing
the
plaintiff
to
allege
a
claim
directly
if
she
has
one
against
the
third
party
defendants.
rule
14
does
authorize
that.
but,
at
least
in
the
situation
where
those
parties
are
not
already
in
the
case,
our
concern
is
that
recognizing
pendent-party
jurisdiction
might
throw
on
the
discretion
of
the
district
courts
a
very
heavy
burden,
a
discretion
that
would
be
essentially
unreviewable.
to
make
decisions
about
when
and
whether
consolidation
of
trial
makes
sense.
our
suspicion
is
that
many
of
these
cases
would
end
up
in
state
courts
anyway.
in
the
case
of
moor
against
the
county
of
alameda,
a
1983
case,
that's
exactly
what
happened
and
this
court
did
not
reach
the
pendent-party
question
because
the
district
court
had
decided,
in
its
discretion,
to
send
the
state
case
back
to
the
state
courts.
even
in
those
cases
that
were
kept
in
federal
court,
we
contend
that
the
trial
judge
would
in
many
cases
find
it
inconvenient
and
inefficient
to
consolidate
for
trial
and
would
end
up
separating
the
cases
out
for
trial
anyway
because
of
the
number
of
separate
issues
involved
and
because
of
the
existence
of
a
jury
in
one
situation
and
not
in
another.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
yes.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
we
would
as
a
result
of
two--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--well,
we
would
have
the
same
result,
but
as
a
result
of
two
quite
independent
jurisdictional
provisions.
not
as
the
result
of
a
specific
congressional
policy
determination.
the
trial
of
these
cases
as
a
matter
of
one
single
lawsuit
makes
sense.
and,
indeed,
it
might
well
be
that
even
though
there
were
two
separate
lawsuits
pending
in
the
same
court,
there
would
be
no
effort
made
to
consolidate
them.
or
they
might
be
consolidated.
but,
that
does
not
reflect
any
special
congressional
judgement
that
consolidated
trial
makes
sense.
it's
simply
the
fortuitous.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--incidents
of
two
separate
jurisdictions.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
yes,
it
would.
yes,
your
honor.
so,
for
all
those
reasons,
we
respectfully
request
that
the
judgment
below
be
affirmed.
