justice
marshall
what
about
the
judge
saying
the
irs
can
get
this
information
on
the
provision
that
they
let
no
one
else
see
it?
nobody
else?
justice
marshall
would
be
what?
justice
marshall
so...
so
it's
all
right
for
the
irs
to
give
it
to
the
newspapers?
justice
marshall
well,
suppose--
justice
marshall
--that
the
court
says
irs
shouldn't
get
this
but
you
shall
not
release
it
to
the
newspapers?
justice
marshall
and
you
say
that's
wrong?
justice
marshall
does
the
irs
have
the
right
to
turn
over
confidential
material
to
the
newspapers?
where
did
they
get
it
from?
justice
marshall
i
don't
see
why
a
court
doesn't
have
a
right
to
control
its
own
orders
rather
than
to
have
the
irs
control
the
court's
discretion.
justice
marshall
do
you
understand
what
i
mean?
justice
marshall
what
is
a
procedure
to
stop
the
irs
from
giving
this
information
to
the
justice
department?
justice
marshall
damage
action?
justice
marshall
have
you
ever
seen
one
of
those?
justice
marshall
you're
sure?
justice
marshall
you've
seen
one?
justice
marshall
do
you--
justice
marshall
--i
thought
i
hadn't
seen
one
i--
justice
marshall
--i
was
in
another
position;
i
didn't
see
it
either.
justice
marshall
does
the
irs
still
use
outside
people
to
get
this
information?
justice
marshall
electronic.
justice
marshall
electronically,
does
the
irs
still
shop
it
out
for
private
people
to
do
it?
