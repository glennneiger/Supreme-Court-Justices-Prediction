justice
stevens
mr.
horowitz,
let
me
interrupt
you
too.
you
stress
that
the
district
court
said
there
is
not
an
iota
of
evidence
of
bad
faith,
harassment,
or
anything
of
that
kind.
what
if
the
district
judge
had
said
there's
been
a
lot
of
evidence
offered
of
bad
faith.
i
think
in
balance
it
doesn't
carry
the
day
and
i
want
to
let
the
government
enforce
the
subpoena.
but
just
as
additional
insurance,
i'm
going
to
order
them
to
limit
its
use
in
this
way.
would
your
argument
be
any
different?
justice
stevens
it
comes
down
to--
justice
stevens
--he
says,
i'm
willing
to
conclude...
i've
got
some
doubts
in
this
case.
because
sometimes
the
facts
are
close.
we
just
heard
one
where
there
are
good
arguments
on
both
sides.
and
he
says,
i
think
the
government
is...
and
balance
is
correct
here.
but
it's
not
a
case
of
no
iota
of
evidence
because
it
really
doesn't
make
a
difference
here.
but
there
are...
there
is...
i
am
somewhat
concerned.
justice
stevens
would
you...
you'd
make
exactly
the
same
argument,
wouldn't
you?
justice
stevens
but
would
you
be--
justice
stevens
--are
you
better
off
putting
the
judge
to
the
absolute
choice
of
saying,
well,
i've
got
enough
doubt.
i
guess
i'd
better
deny
enforcement.
justice
stevens
wouldn't
you--
justice
stevens
--well,
i
understand--
justice
stevens
--i
understand
that
you're--
justice
stevens
--argument.
i
just
was
curious
as
why
you
stressed
the
fact
that
there
was
no
iota
of
evidence
because--
justice
stevens
--in
that
case
it
doesn't
really
make
much
difference.
justice
stevens
well,
but
let's
assume
there
are
some
cases
out
there
where
the
judge
might
thing
there's...
you
know,
it's
a
close
case.
you
think
he
should--
justice
stevens
--in
all
close
cases
just
simply
rule
against
the
government.
justice
stevens
well,
he
thinks
there
is
some
reason
to
believe
that
one
government
attorney
is
concerned
about
the
civil
action
pending
in
another
court
and
he
just
isn't
a
hundred
percent
sure
that
there
is
complete
good
faith
in
that
sense.
and
he
says,
well,
i'll
go
ahead
and
let
you
get
the
information
if
you
give
me
your
assurance
that
you're
not
going
to
use
it
improperly.
justice
stevens
well,
i--
justice
stevens
--well,
how
does--
justice
stevens
--that
hurt
you?
that's
the
thing
i
don't
understand.
justice
stevens
mr.
horowitz,
in
a
grand
jury
context
do
you
think
the
trial
judge
would
have
the
authority
to
condition
enforcement
of
a
grand
jury's
subpoena
on
some
kind
of
protective
order?
say
it
disclosed
trade
secrets
or
something
like
that
and
say--
justice
stevens
--to
the
government
that
there
are
limits
on
what
you
can
do
with
the
material?
justice
stevens
but
any
kind.
would
you
take
the
same
absolute
position
in
a
grand
jury's
subpoena
you
take
here,
if
there's
absolutely
no
limits
that
the
judge
can
impose?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
and
there
are
restrictions
on
grand
jury
material,
too.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
well,
he...
whatever
the
protection
is...
there
are
cases
where
judges
have
imposed
additional
restrictions
on
responses
to
grand
jury
subpoenas.
i
don't
think
it's
ever
come
to
this
court.
i
just
wonder
if
the
issue
is
any
different.
that's
really
all
i'm
asking.
justice
stevens
because
there's
no
statutory...
you
know,
program
for
them
as
there
is...
when
there
is
another--
justice
stevens
--right.
but
any
particular
document
that
is
produced,
that's
all
the
judge
can
do,
is
say
produce
it.
he
can't--
justice
stevens
--either
yes
or
no.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
well,
that
may
be
true.
but
wouldn't
you
say
that
if
there
was
nothing
except
a...
a
suspicion
by
the
government,
or
by
anybody
else,
that
the
crime...
crime-fraud...
fraud
exception
would
be
met
the
judge
would
have
a
legal
duty
not
to
look.
wouldn't
he
have
to
respect
the
privilege?
he
or
she
have
to
respect
the
privilege?
justice
stevens
so,
basically
as
a
practical
matter
the
question
is
how
much
evidence--
justice
stevens
--does
the
government
need.
justice
stevens
and
what--
justice
stevens
--and
what
is
your
position?
because
i
think
i
have
the
same
difficulty
justice
scalia
did
in
reading
your
brief.
you
seem
to
be
saying
they
don't
really
need
anything.
but
i
think
you've
kind
of
acknowledged
they
need
something.
justice
stevens
then
how
do
we
define--
justice
stevens
--and
that's
the
question.
how
do
we
define
that
something?
justice
stevens
--and
your
position
is--
justice
stevens
--i
see.
your
position
is
that,
whatever
the
line
is,
that
you
met
it
in
this
case,
and
if
you
can
meet
that
line,
you
can
look
at
the
document
to
be
sure
that
there...
i
mean
to
be
satisfied
or
something.
justice
stevens
that's
basically
what--
justice
stevens
--yes.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
no.
i
think
you're
leaving
out
a
step.
i
think
justice
scalia
and
i
are
both
assuming
that
without
just
coming
into
court
and
referring
to
the
privilege
the
government
has
legitimately
acquired
possession
of
a
privileged
communication
which
it
had
a
right
to
look
at.
could
it
then
go
ahead
and
ask
the
judge
also
to
look
at
it
to
make
this
determination?
justice
stevens
no.
but
the
trial
judge
or
the
court
of
appeals...
i
can't
remember
which...
assumed
that
they
may
well
have
had
it
legitimately
but,
nevertheless,
said
we
don't
care
about
that,
we
cannot
look
inside
this--
justice
stevens
that
wouldn't
be--
justice
stevens
--or
production
of
books,
records,
papers,
or
other
data?
justice
stevens
you
would
say--
justice
stevens
--but
you
said
they
could
not
substitute
an
interrogatory
or
summary
procedure,
or
something
like
that?
justice
stevens
okay.
