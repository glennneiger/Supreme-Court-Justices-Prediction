justice
white
well,
what
if
the...
what
if
the
taxpayer
being
investigated
finds
out
that
the
government
isn't
living
up
to
the
rules
and
they
exchange
information,
or
that
people
who
have
no
business
knowing
it
are
seeing
it?
what's
he
supposed
to
do?
go
back
to
the
judge?
justice
white
go
to
a
new
judge?
justice
white
then
the
court
has
a
role
in
monitoring
the
irs'
performance?
justice
white
but
a
judge
is
going
to
decide
that
case.
justice
white
but
how
about
getting
an
order
to
stop
doing
what
you're
doing?
justice
white
okay.
justice
white
--but
what
is
the
standard,
though,
when
you
need
independent
evidence?
is
it
a
probable
cause
standard
or
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
or
what?
justice
white
--probable
cause?
justice
white
what
kind
of
evidence?
i
suppose
you'd
say
there
would
have
to
be
a
record
made
before
the
district
judge,
there
must
be
some
evidence
of
some
danger
or
risk
of
disclosure?
the
judge
just
can't
say,
i
don't
trust
the
irs
and
i'm
going
to
enter
this
order,
i
don't
suppose.
justice
white
what
kind
of
facts?
justice
white
actual
concrete
evidence
and
here
are
these
other
unreliable
government
attorneys.
justice
white
and
you
think
you
made
that
kind
of
a
record
here...
that
raising
a
real
valid
doubt
about
the
veracity
and
trustworthiness
of
the
testimony
in
this--
justice
white
well,
that
just
means
that
i'm
going
to
make
the
government
obey
the
law.
justice
white
what
page
of
the
joint
appendix
are
you--
justice
white
--all
right.
justice
white
well,
if
congress...
congress
though
in
a
statute,
in
the
summons
statues,
they
set
the
ground
rules...
they
impose
the
confidentiality
and
say
what's
going
to
happen
if
you
break
the
law.
why
should
the
judge
be
able
to
supplement
that
statutory
regime?
justice
white
well,
a
judge
can
say
i'm
sure
that
they'd
be
more
likely
to
obey
me
than
the
statute?
justice
white
and
set
up
a
regime
where
they
could
punish
the
breach
of
their
order.
