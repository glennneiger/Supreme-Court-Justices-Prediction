justice
scalia
but
you
don't
advertise
them
a
lot,
right?
[laughter]
justice
scalia
mr.
horowitz,
can
i...
do
i
understand
your
position
correctly?
you
do
not
deny
that
you
need
some
prima
facie
evidence
before
you
go
in
camera?
you...
you
don't
assert
that
you
can
just
come
into
the
judge
and
say,
you
know,
we
suspect
that
this
is
not
really
a
privileged
communication.
we
want
you
to
look
it
over
in
camera.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
well,
that's...
that's
comforting.
but
you're
not
willing
to
admit
that
the
district
court
can't
do
it?
justice
scalia
but
not
as
a
legal
matter,
just
as
you
still
keep
on
saying.
as
a
practical
matter
they
need
something
here.
justice
scalia
you
still
won't
concede--
justice
scalia
--have
you
noticed
that--
justice
scalia
but
the
issue
is
simply
whether
that
evidence
can
be
the
communication
itself,
which
the
government
has
gotten
ahold
of
in
some
other
fashion.
why
can't
that
evidence
be
the
communication
itself?
justice
scalia
mr.
hertzberg,
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
what...
what
you
would
require
by
way
of
prima
facie
evidence.
suppose
the
advice
is
given
at
a
meeting
in
which
a
third
party
is
present
and
the
government
has
testimony
from
the
third
party
saying
this
wasn't
just
legal
advise;
they
were
in
fact
planning...
planning
the
fraud.
would
that
be
enough?
justice
scalia
because
he
was
there
and
he
overheard
it?
justice
scalia
but
if
you
had
a
tape
of
it,
that
would
be
no
good?
justice
scalia
what
sense
is
there
in
that
distinction?
i
can't
understand
that
at
all.
justice
scalia
and
the
other
one
turns
on
the
fortuity
of
somebody
happening
to
have
been
present.
i
mean--
justice
scalia
--well,
that
would
seem
more
logical,
i
must
say.
justice
scalia
you
wouldn't
let
the
witness
in
either?
justice
scalia
well,
what
kind
of
evidence
do
you
want
of...
that
the
fraud
exists?
justice
scalia
as
it
happens,
that's
what
my
question
goes
to.
that
happens
exactly
to
be
it.
section
552
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
authorizes
a
court
to
order
the
production
of
records
from
an
agency.
the
same
section
says
that
agencies
don't
have
to
turn
over
law
enforcement
investigatory
records
if
they
would,
among
other
things,
endanger
the
life
or
physical
safety
of
a
law
enforcement
officer.
now,
suppose
a
court
has
a
refusal
by
the
fbi
to
turn
over
some
information
on
the
ground
that
it
would...
it
would
endanger
witnesses
or
law
enforcement
agents.
and
the
requestor
happens
to
be
someone
who
has
mob
connections.
and
the
court
says,
well,
gee,
i
don't
really
know
whether
it
would
endanger
or
not.
but,
just
to
be
sure,
i'll
order
the
production
of
the
documents.
but
you
shouldn't
give
them
to
anybody
else.
or,
it
puts
some
other
condition
on
them.
do
you
think
a
court
has
inherent
power
to
do
that?
justice
scalia
is
that
right?
under
the
apa?
do
you
know
any
court
that's
ever
done
it
under
the
apa?
i
always
thought
the
choice
was
you
either
turn
it
over
or
you
don't
turn
it
over.
if
you
have
enough
doubts,
you
don't
turn
it
over.
you
can't
say,
we'll
turn
it
over,
but--
justice
scalia
--no,
i
don't
think...
i
don't
think--
justice
scalia
--trust
me.
i
bet
you
there
aren't
any.
justice
scalia
now,
why
is
this
different
from...
here
you
have
a
statute
that's...
that's
in
most
respects
similar.
why
is
it
different
from
the--
justice
scalia
--you've
told
me
why
this
distinguishes
your
case
from
the
freedom
of
information
act.
why
can't
you
say
the
same
thing
under
foia?
we
want
to
make
sure
that
our
process
isn't
abused.
we
are...
we
are
compelling
the
agency
to
produce
these
documents,
as
we're
authorized
to,
and
we
want
to
be
sure
that
this
process
isn't
abused.
so,
we're
telling
you
don't
turn
over
the
name
to
the
mob
on
pain
of
being
in
contempt.
justice
scalia
well,
i'm
just
saying
the
principle
that
espousing
would
whenever
the
court
issues
an
injunction
or
any
sort
of
order
for
the
obtaining
of
records.
are
you
prepared
to
say
that
it
is
that
generally
applicable?
that
whenever,
under
any
statute,
a
court
has
the
authority
to
compel
the
production
of
records
it
may
condition
the
receipt
of
those
records?
