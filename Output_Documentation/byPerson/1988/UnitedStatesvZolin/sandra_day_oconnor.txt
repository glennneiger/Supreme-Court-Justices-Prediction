mr.
horowitz--
--mr.
horowitz,
how
did
that
order
interfere
with
the
irs'
ability
to
gather
information
about
its
own
tax
investigation?
i...
you
know,
i
had
a
little
difficulty
understanding
how
the
government
is
hurt
by
that
kind
of
order.
justice
o'connor
yes,
so
the
irs
wasn't
hindered
at
all
by
that--
justice
o'connor
--as
far
as
i
can
see
it.
justice
o'connor
what
if
it
had?
are
there
limits
on
the
court's
power
in
this
regard
to
enter
protective
orders?
