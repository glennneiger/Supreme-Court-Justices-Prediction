mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
believe
that
the...
addressing,
first,
the
crime-fraud
issue...
i
believe
that
the
government
has
effectively
conceded
that
there
is
a
need
for
some
independent
evidence...
an
independent
evidence
rule,
as
it
were...
before
a
court
may
upon
a
mere
incantation
of
the
words
crime-fraud
review
privileged
communications
between
an
attorney
and
a
client
for
which
a
privilege
has
already
been
established.
if
i
understood
counsel's
answers
to
the
questions
posed
by
justice
scalia
and
justice
stevens,
he
said
there
has
to
be
some
sort
of
evidence,
there
has
to
be
some
sort
of
reason
submitted
by
the
government.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
it
should
not
be
the
communication
itself
because
otherwise,
in
the
first
instance,
a
party...
whether
it
be
the
government
or
an
adverse
civil
litigant...
could
come
into
court
and
just
ritualistically
intone
the
terms
crime-fraud
with
respect
to
privileged
communications,
and
under
the
scenario
which
the
government
outlines--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--it
should
not
be
able
to.
first,
let
me
just
make
it
clear
that
in
this
particular
case
there
is
no
record
to
show
that
the
government
legitimately
obtained
the
particular
communications
which
are
at
issue
in
this
case.
there
was
no
determination
made
about
that
below.
that
was
not
the
issue
below.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
well,
in
fact,
justice
stevens,
the
trial
judge
over
our
objections
did
look
at
the
massive
excerpts
from
the
tape
recordings,
which
are
the
communications
in
this
particular
case,
and
in
fact
found
that
they
did
not
establish
a
prima
facie
case
of
crime
or
fraud.
so,
the
district
court
in
this
case,
in
an
ironic
twist,
over
our
objection,
did
look
at
the
communication.
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
said
that
the
district
court
should
have
initially
considered
independent
evidence
only
to
determine
whether
there
was
communication
in
furtherance
of
a
crime
or
fraud.
and
we
think
that
that
test,
which
was
enunciated
by
the
ninth
circuit,
and
which
as
we
have
demonstrated
in
our
briefs
is
in
practice
employed
in
one
form
or
another
by
many
courts
of
appeals
and
federal
district
courts
throughout
the
country,
is
the
proper
approach.
the...
the
analysis
should
not
turn
on
whether
fortuitously
the
government
or
an
adverse
civil
party
has
managed
to
get
privileged
communication,
and
has
them,
and
can
submit
them
to
the
court
along
with
an
allegation
of
crime-fraud.
there
has
to
be
a
standardized,
methodical
and
logical
approach
before
the
analysis
can
be
made.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
your
honor,
the
courts
have
given
slightly
different
formulations.
the
second
circuit
apparently
does
use
a
probable
cause
standard.
the
ninth
circuit,
without
elaboration
referred
to...
and
all
the
courts,
of
course,
refer
to
the
prima
facie
test.
we
submit
that
the
prima
facie
test
in
the
general
sense
in
which
that
term
is
used
means
a
case...
a
prima
facie
showing...
a
case
which
is
enough
to
support
a
directed
verdict
if
unrebutted.
we're
comfortable
enough
with
that
definition.
and
the
government
failed
to--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--excuse
me,
your
honor?
you're
not
comfortable
with
the
second
circuit's
standards?
oh,
i'm
sure
that
there
is...
if
anything,
it
may
be
a
higher
standard,
and
i
would
be
equally
if
not
more
comfortable
with
it.
i'm
not
urging
one
standard
or
another
because
in
this
case
at
every
stage
the
government
failed...
in
the
district
court,
with
the
court
looking
at
the
communications
and
the
independent
evidence,
in
the
court
of
appeal,
with
the
court...
the
ninth
circuit
panel
determining
that
the
government
had
not
even
made
out
a
prima
facie--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--case
of
illegality.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
that's--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--we
don't
see
any
such
inconsistency
at
all.
in
fact,
if
anything,
justice
rehnquist,
we
think
that
the
bourjaily
case
supports
us.
in
that
case
this
court
merely
determined
that
the
showing
the
preliminary
evidentiary
determination
by
a
district
court
judge
on
the
co-conspirator
hearsay
exception
under
rule
801
could
be
made
by
looking
at
the
hearsay
statements
themselves.
this
court
did
not
reach
a
question
of
whether
it
could
be
made
exclusively
by
looking
at
those
statements,
but
it
said
they
could
be
considered.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
and
this
court--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--however,
justice
rehnquist,
the
foundation
for
this
court's
decision
in
bourjaily
was
referenced
to
rule
104(a)
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence.
and
that
rule
provides
that
in
making
preliminary
evidentiary
determinations
a
court
may
look
at
any
evidence
except
privileged
communications.
and
we
are,
of
course...
we
fall
within
the
privilege.
these...
these
tapes
which
are
at
issue
in
this
case
were
found
to
be
privileged
communications.
so,
the
104(a)
exception--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--well,
your
honor,
in
this
way.
because
we
were
able
to
establish
without
submission
to
the
court
in
camera
below
in
the
district
court
that
these
documents
were
presumptively
privileged.
and
then
the
burden
shifts...
when
somebody
comes
later
on,
as
the
government
did,
the
burden
shifts
to
the
opponent
of
the
privilege.
and
they
carry
a
serious
burden
here
to
try
to
strip
the
privilege.
and
that's
the
analyses.
this
is
not
just
a
concurrent
mix
necessarily.
in
the
first
instance,
these
communications--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--your
honor,
i'm
not
basing
this
on
a
particular
case.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
i'm
basing
it
on
what
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
have...
i'm
not
sure
that
there's
an
authority
that
specifically
addresses
the
order
in
which
the
crime-fraud
exception
is
applied
on
a
claim
of
privilege.
but
in
very
many
cases
it
is
undisputed
that
communications
are
protected
by
the
attorney/client
privilege,
save
for
the
possibility
that
they
may
be
subject
to
the
crime-fraud
exception
and
that
the
crime-fraud
exception
will
strip
them
of
the
privilege.
for
instance,
when
the
government's
subpoenas
for
documents
from
an
attorney
office
for
a
grand
jury,
for
example,
they
rarely
will
say
these
were
not
communications
in
confidence
between
the
attorney
and
the
client.
they
will
assert...
they
will
in
effect
concede
that
but
for
their
claim
of
the
crime-fraud
exception
the
documents
are
privileged.
and
that's
what
i'm
referring
to
in
this
particular
instance.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
yes.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
yes.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
no.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
well,
i'll
tell
you
what
the
difference
is.
your
honor's
question
turns
on
the
fortuity
of
the
government
happening
to
have
the
tape
here.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
if
there
was
a
witness...
if
there
is
a
witness,
the
witness
confirms...
i
suppose...
backing
up
for
one
moment,
your
honor.
i
suppose
the
witness
might
not
be
able
to
testify
absent
independent
evidence.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
yes.
i
was
too
quick
to...
to
agree
with--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--no,
i
would
not,
because
if
the
rule
is
to
be
served--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--the
kind
of
evidence
that
invariably
the
government
or
civil
parties
have
anyway.
that
there
was
some
wrongdoing.
i
mean,
presumably
the
government
is
not
conducting
a
grand
jury
investigation
or
allegations
made
in
a
civil
case
in
a
vacuum.
they're
not
taking...
randomly
accusing
somebody
of
wrongdoing.
they
have
some
evidence
that
there
was
wrongdoing
going
on,
and
they
have
prima
facie
evidence
or
reason
to
believe
that
the
attorneys
may
have
furthered
the
wrongdoing.
and
they
make
the
allegation
of
the
crime-fraud
exception.
but
the
government
cannot
go
around
and...
and
i
do
not
understand
counsel
to
suggest
that
they
could
randomly
without
any
basis
in
fact
suspect
that
an
attorney/client
communications
between...
confidential
communications
were
in
furtherance
of
a
crime-fraud.
and
that's
all
the
prima
facie
case
requires.
it
only
requires
that
the
mere
invocation
of
the
words
crime-fraud
be
supported
by
some
factual
underpinning
before--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--well,
if
we're
addressing
this
case
in
particular,
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
that
at
the
least
there
would
have
to
be
a
question
on
remand
about
whether
the
government
was
rightfully
in
possession
of
the...
of
the
tapes.
and
i
think
that's
a
question
that
wasn't
reached
and
need
not
have
been
reached
under
the
prevailing--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--but
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
independent
evidence
test
serves
a
very
logical
purpose.
it
balances
the
need
for
relevant
evidence
with
the
need
for
society
to--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--well,
first,
let
me
remind
the
court
that
in
this
case
they
did
not
and
they
were
found
not
to...
not
to
have--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--not
to
have.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
well,
it
has
in
part
because
the
ninth
circuit
found--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--your
honor,
we
would
say
that
the
salutary
effect
of
the
independent
evidence
rule
in
those
rare
instances
where
a
party
happens
to
have
the
confidences
to
begin
with...
and
that
would
be
extremely
rare...
normally
when
the
party
is
seeking
access
to
the
attorney/client
communications,
they
don't
have
them
to
begin
with.
but
in
those
rare,
rare
instances,
as
by
happenstance
occurred
for
instance
in
this
case,
the
purpose
of
the
rule
is
better
served
by
still
requiring
that
there
be
a
prima
facie
showing
at
the
outset.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
to
satisfy
the
court--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--that
the
court
should
not
look
at
them,
in
the
first
instance.
yes,
that
is
our
position.
in
those
rare
instances.
again,
i
want
to
stress
that
it
is
not...
it
is
far
from
normal...
it
is
highly
unusual
to
contemplate
a
situation
where
a...
whether
it's
a
government
or
a
civil
party...
is
seeking
the
court's
process
to
obtain
documents
that
they
have
already.
we
do
not
want...
we
don't
think
the
court
should
give
an
advantage
to
a
party
that
manages
to
get
within
its
possession
before
a
determination
by
a
court
of
the
privileged
communications.
this
could
encourage,
for
instance--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--not
necessarily.
but
i
think
that
if
this
court
had
a
different
rule
for
that
particular
unusual
circumstance,
it
might
encourage
situations...
particularly
in
the
civil
arena
where
major
corporations
are
litigating
against
each
other,
and
there
could
be
an
inducement
for
a
corporation
to
try
to...
if
it
were
a
disaffected
employee
or
otherwise...
to
get
confidential
communications
from
the
other
side
and
then
feel
all
they
have
to
do
is
holler
crime-fraud
and
the
court
can
start
going
through
the
entirety
of
the
communications.
so,
we
think
that
that
would
be...
for
purposes
of
uniform
application,
there
should
be
some
quantum,
which
we
maintain
to
be
the
prima
facie
showing,
of
crime
or
fraud
to
support
that
allegation
before
in
camera
review
can
be
sought.
i
want
to
turn
to
the
other
issue
that
is
raised
by
the
government.
and
that
is
the
question
about
the
order
of
this
court.
we
believe
that
that
order
is
well-supported
by
the
inherent
power
of
article
iii
courts
to
insure
that
their
process
is
not
abused.
it
is
fundamental.
it
comes
from
as
long
ago
as
the
gumbel
v.
pitkin
decision
of
this
court
in
1888,
though
the
powell
case
which
specifically
in
the
context
of
summons
enforcement
actions
warned
that
it
is
the
process
of
the
court
that
is
being
sought
to
enforce
a
summons
by
the
internal
revenue
service,
and
courts
should
not
allow
that
process
to
be
abused.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
i...
i
read
that,
your
honor.
however,
respectfully,
the
stuart
case
presented
a
very
far
and
different
issue
and
was
not...
i
think
that
that
one
statement
that
you've
extracted,
justice
kennedy,
certainly
not
made
in
the
context
of
the
issue
that's
before
this
court
on
the
protective
order
that
was
issued
below.
what
the
government
seems...
the
government,
by
the
way,
has
really
retreated,
as
i
understand
their
oral
argument,
from
the
premise
of
their
brief...
the
question
presented
in
their
brief.
in
the
brief,
and
the
question
on
which
they
sought
and
obtained
certiorari
in
this
court,
was
the
argument
that
district
courts
are
wholly
without
authority
under
any
circumstances
whatsoever
in
summons
enforcement
proceedings
to
take
any
steps
to
make
sure
that
their
process
is
not
abused.
they
said
enforcement
or
denial,
there's
no
in
between.
now,
they
start
their
argument
off
today
by
quibbling
about
the
record
below.
did
we
make
a
sufficient
showing?
well,
the
district
court,
notwithstanding
the
language
which
my
learned
opponent
quoted
to
the
court,
the
district
court
did
find
that
we
had
raised
a
real
fear
that
the
five
documents
which
we
were
enforcing
through
the
summons
would
be
turned
over
to
the
government
and
possibly
then
given
to
civil
attorneys
for
the
department
of
justice.
and
he
articulated
that
fear
in
the
record.
and
the
ninth
circuit
reviewed,
looking
for
abusive
discretion,
specifically
reviewed
the
record...
and
it
was
an
ample
record
that
was
before
the
court...
there
was
a
hearing
and
there
was
considerable
testimony
to
substantiate
what
the
court
of
appeals
decided
was
a
real
fear
that
information
purportedly
being
sought
under
authority
of
the
summons
might
be
used
for
an
improper
purpose
and
disseminated
improperly
later
on.
and
the
result
was
what
my
colleague
calls
now
the
narrow
order
or
the
fairly
benign
order
of
the
court.
and
we
think
it
was
extremely
narrow.
all
it
does
is
say
to
the
government
you
can't
use
those
five
documents
that
i'm
giving
you
for
any
purpose
other
than...
reference
to
the
department
of
justice
for
criminal
prosecution,
which
is
the
premise
on
which
you
came
to
this
court
in
the
first
place.
or,
you
must
obtain
an
order
of
this
court.
it
didn't
say
you
can't
communicate
with
other
government
agencies.
it
didn't
say
you
can't
go
out
in
the
world
and
look
for
witnesses
and
talk
to
them
and--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--proceed
with
an
investigation.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
that's,
i
think,
a
fairly
broad
question.
it's
hard
for
me
to
say
that
there
couldn't
be
some
limits,
but
those
limits
are
not
in
our
case.
i
don't
think
we
need
reach
that
question,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
that
the--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--well,
i
think
that...
i
think
that
the
dimensions
of
the
rule
are
that,
as
i...
as
i
can
formulate
them,
that
the
court
can
fashion
an
order
when
it
feels
that
the
record
warrants
it
to
insure
that
its
process
is
not
abused.
within
those
parameters,
it
has
that
inherent
power.
and
the
government...
as
long
as
there
is
no
indication
that...
i
would
add
this.
as
long
as
there
is
no
indication
that
it
would
interfere
with
the
investigation
of
the
government.
and
there
has
been
no
such
real
argument
made
in
this
case
by
the
government.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
well,
presumably
he
would
have
a
factual
record
which
would
warrant
applying--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--i
think
the
kind
of
facts--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--yes.
the
kind
of
record
that
was
adduced
in
this
case,
justice
white.
and
a
record
that
would
be
reviewed
by
a
court
of
appeal
for
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
yes.
the
district
court
felt
we
had
and
the
court
of
appeals
felt
we
had...
and
called
it
a
wise
exercise
of
control
and
exercise
of
discretion.
and
that
record...
i
don't
want
to
get
too
much
into
the
record...
but
in
a
very
brief
hearing
that
we
were
afforded,
there
was
an
undisputed
record
of
constant
communication
between
the
department
of
justice
civil
attorneys
engaged
in
non-tax
related
litigation
in
washington
against
the
church
of
scientology.
on
the
telephone
constantly--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--now,
justice
rehnquist,
our
joint
appendix--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--well,
you...
i...
i
was
confused.
i
thought
you
said
26a.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
right.
yes.
well,
what
he's
referring
to,
justice
rehnquist,
when
he
says
reasonable
is
the
record,
which
is
reflected
at
joint
appendix
page
67.
there
are
the
court's
concerns
articulated.
at
page--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--justice
rehnquist,
in
context...
with
all
due
respect,
in
the
context
of
the
record
that
was
adduced,
what
the
court
is
saying
there
is
that
because
the
government
said
they
wanted
it
for
a
tax
investigation
and
because
my
order
would
allow
the
government
to
use
it
for
that
proper
purpose
but
not
for
an
improper
purpose,
i
am
imposing
the
restriction.
that
is...
that
is
precisely
the
context
of
that
remark
by
the
court.
and
it's
further
amplified--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--well,
but
it's
more
than
that,
justice
white.
because
in
this
case,
as
both
courts
below
found...
as
both
courts
found
below,
there
was
ample
reason
to
believe
in
this
sul
generis
case,
as
the
district
court
stated--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--page
67.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
the
colloquy
there,
particularly
that
of
the
court.
the
court
misspoke
on
the
third
line
where
it
says,
"the
irs
and
the
united
states
in
general
carrying
on
litigation.
"
he
meant
the
irs
and
the
church
of
scientology.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
could
i
just
add
one
thing,
please?
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
i
just
want
to
stress
as
emphatically
as
i
can,
that
the
issue
before
this
court,
is
the
inherent
power
of
the
court.
not
the
strength
of
the
record.
the
government
lost
below
on
the
strength
of
the
record.
the
stark
issue
that
they
posed
by
the
petition
is,
is
the
court
under
any
circumstances...
strong
record
or
not...
permitted
to
issue
this
kind
of
order?
and
i
don't
think
that
this
court
should
be
reviewing
the
record
in
that
context.
the
only
question
that
the
court
was
asked
to
resolve
by
the
government
is
does
the
court
have
the
power,
assuming
there
is
a
sufficient
record.
as
the
courts
below
found--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--if...
yes,
it
does.
if--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--i
would
distinguish...
i
can't
cite
a
case,
justice
scalia--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--but
i
would
distinguish
the
hypothetical--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--okay.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
it's
different
because
the
internal
revenue
service
comes
to
the
district
court
for
enforcement
of
the
summons.
the
summons
cannot
be
enforced
without
the
authority
of
the
district
court.
and,
for
instance,
the
statutes
under
which
the
internal
revenue
service
must
move
to
get
summons
enforcements...
those
are
7402(b)
and
7604(a)
of
the
internal
revenue
code...
say,
by
appropriate
process
the
district
court
may
enforce
a
summons.
the
irs
must
come
to
the
district
court
and
the
moment
that
they
do,
and
the
moment
the
concept
of
appropriate
process
is
implicated,
at
that
time
we
submit
that
the
court
has
inherent
power,
if
it
is
satisfied
by
the
showing
made
before
it,
as
it
was
in
this
case,
to
insure
that
his
process
is
not
abused
later
on.
and
the
government
has
not
demonstrated
any
way...
the
quibble
with
the
record,
but
i
submit
again
that's
not
the
issue
before
this
court.
the
legal
issue
before
this
court
is,
is
the
court...
does
it
have
that
inherent
power
or
is
it
utterly
without
that
inherent
power?
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
i'm
not...
i
must
say
i'm
not
following
the...
the--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--i
don't
see
why
it
wouldn't
have
that
power.
pursuant
to
the
inherent
power
of
the
court,
i
don't
see
why
it
would
not.
if
it
has
adequate
reason
to
believe
that
its
process
could
be
abused,
i
don't
see
why
it
would
not.
on
the--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--the
court
is
not
supplementing
it,
justice
white.
the
court
is
in
fact
aiding
and
seeing
to
it
that
that
statute
and
other
statutes
are
obeyed.
the
statutory
scheme
not
only
in
6103
but,
for
instance,
such
as
in
7206
of
the
internal
revenue
code
which
sets
forth
the
precise
narrow
grounds
on
which
a
summons
may
be
issued
by
the
commissioner
of
the
internal
revenue
service,
implicates
a
valuation
by
the
district
court
as
to
whether
the
summoned
material
is
going
to
be
used
for
a
proper
purpose.
and
the
government
must
go
to
the
district
court
and
it
must
say
we
want
enforcement.
and
by
the
way,
the
interests...
what
we're
suggesting
we
think
also
strikes
a
perfect
balance...
the
government
is
saying
it's
all
or
nothing.
the...
the...
in
effect,
with
their
argument,
at
worst
for
us
there
would
have
to
be
a
remand
to
the
district
court
if
it
was
without
power
to
issue
the
protective
order
that
it
did
to
determine
whether
it
wants
to
deny
enforcement
under
the
circumstances.
but
we
think
the
kind
of
order
that
was
well-reasoned
and
entered
into
this
case
strikes
a
perfect
balance.
it
gives
to
the
internal
revenue
service
the
materials
it
sought
for
the
summons
purposes
that
it
wanted
it.
but
it
insures,
when
it
feels
that
there's
a
danger
that
it
might
be
abused,
and
it
at
the
same
time
insures
that
the
court's
process
will
not
be
abused
and
that
the
summons
materials
will
not
be
used
for
an
improper
purpose.
we
would
think,
actually,
that
the
government
would
be
in
favor
of
this.
it
historically
poses
the
question
of
whether
there
has
to
be
summons
denial
or
not.
and,
in
fact,
the
government
says
that
there
are
instances
where
summons
are
denied.
we
think
that
if
their
all-or-nothing
test
is
adopted,
perhaps
there
will
be
more
denials
of
summons,
because
district
courts
will
then
be
without
the
option
of
deciding
that
they
can
take
a
middle
ground,
as
the
court
did
in
this
case
under
the
circumstances
which
were
well-warranted.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
well,
your
honor,
that
question
subsumes
that
the
court
just
did
this
automatically
in
a
vacuum,
and
it
did
not.
there
was
a
record,
and
it
does...
it
does
perhaps
subsume
that.
perhaps
that
is
exactly
what
is
necessary,
that
district
courts
admonish
or
remind
the
government
of
what
their
obligations
are.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
that's
correct.
that's
right.
and
we
feel
that
that
would
be
well-warranted
under
the...
and
so
did
the
ninth
circuit,
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
yes.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
that
i
don't
think
is
the
issue
before
this
court,
justice
kennedy.
but,
in
fact,
what
happened
was...
that
is
not
the
reason
we
say
that
the
court
could
not
hear
the
whole
tape.
to
answer
your
question,
that
is
not
the
reason
why
the
court
couldn't
hear
the
whole
tape.
we
submit
that
without--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--it
is
not.
it
is
not
before
you.
that
issue
was
not
reached
by
the
ninth
circuit
below
because--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--because...
for
two
reasons.
because
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
review
the
government's...
the
issue
of
the
government's
belated
submission
relying
on
the
whole
tapes.
and
it
relied
only...
it
only
looked
at
the
independent
evidence.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
and
it
did
not
find,
even
under
the
independent
evidence
test,
sufficient...
it
did
not
find
sufficient
allegation
of
wrongdoing,
of
illegality.
and
it
didn't
go
beyond
that.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
the
issue
of
the
entire--
