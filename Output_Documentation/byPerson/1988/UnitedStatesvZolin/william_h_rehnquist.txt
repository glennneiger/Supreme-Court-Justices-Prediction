chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
88-40,
united
states
against
frank
zolin.
mr.
horowitz,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
suppose
one
could
ask
rhetorically
what
harm
would
an
injunction
do
against
a
person
who
claims
he's
going
to
obey
the
law
anyway?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but,
still,
you're
entitled
to
object
to
an
injunction
unless
the
showings
made
by
law
required
for
injunction
are
made.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well
mr.
horowitz.
mr.
hertzberg.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
if--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--if
we
sustain
the
government's
position
here,
the
case
would
go
back
to
the
ninth
circuit
for
them
to
review
the
district
court's
determination,
i
suppose.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
the
tapes
themselves...
so,
it's
not
as
if
the
thing
were
totally
moot.
the
government
says
that
your
argument
is
inconsistent
with
our
opinion
a
couple
of
years
ago
in
the
bourjaily
case.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
does--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--the
government
here
is
asking
for
nothing
more
than
consideration
along
with
whatever
evidence
is--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--well,
how...
how
do
you
know
whether
they're
privileged
communications,
though,
if...
if...
before
you
decide
this
challenge
in
one
way
or
the
other,
because
the
crime-fraud
exception
says
it's
not
privileged
if
there
is
crime-fraud
involved?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what's
the
authority
for...
for
that
line
of
progression
that
you're...
first,
a
claim
of
privilege
or
prima
facie?
and
then
the
burden
shifts?
does
that
come
from
one
or
more
of
our
cases?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
are
you
basing
it
on?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
maybe...
maybe
we
could
have
some
higher
authority
than
that.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
what
if
the
government
has
in
its
possession
the
things
that
you're
claiming
are
privileged,
and
it's
perfectly
evident
from
examining
those
documents
that
there
was
crime
and
fraud
afoot?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
and
certainly
not
raised
by
any
party
to
this
case.
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
do
you
need
an
independent
evidence
when
the
government
is
in
possession
of
the
documents
for
which
the
privilege
is
claimed
and
the
documents
themselves
plainly...
just
have
crime
and
fraud
written
all
over
them?
chief
justice
rehnquist
no?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but...
but
that
finding
has
not
been
reviewed
by
the
ninth
circuit.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
let's
not
get
into...
into
those
side
issues.
what's
your
answer
to
my
question?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
not--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--where
you
can't
rely
on
the
documents
at
all
even
though
the
documents
virtually
scream
fraud?
is
that
your
position?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
there
could
be
an
incentive...
it
could
be
at
fault.
there's
certainly...
you
can't
say
conclusively
that
in
effect
the
other
party
has
a
privileged
communication
means
that
it
acquired
it
by
fault.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--mr.
hertzberg,
on
page
26a
of
the
petition
for
certiorari
where
it's
judge
hupp's
ruling
on
a
motion
for
reconsideration,
he
says
when
the
government
asked
him
to
reconsider
his
order
conditioning...
he
says,
"since
the
entire
basis
of
the
summons
proceeding
was
to
obtain
material
for
a
tax
investigation,
the
court
thinks
it
reasonable
to
restrict
the
use
of
the
material
for
that
purpose
unless
a
criminal
prosecution
is
administered.
"
now,
that
sounds
just...
it
doesn't
sound
from
that...
perhaps
there's
something
else...
he
was
moved
particularly
by
any
showing
in
this
case,
but
just
the
idea
that
the
irs
shouldn't
disobey
the
law.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
are
you
saying
this
doesn't
say
what
i
just
read
to
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that's
exactly
what
i
said...
26a
of
the
petition
for
certiorari.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
i
think
that
it's
very
difficult
to
read
that
sentence
that
way.
it
starts
out,
"since
the
entire
basis
of
a
summons
proceeding
was
to
obtain
material
for
a
tax
investigation,
the
court
thinks
it
reasonable.
"
it
doesn't
say
any
reference
to
the
facts
shown
here.
it's
just
the
idea
if
you're
getting
this
material
for
a
tax
investigation,
you
ought
to
follow
the
rules.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--mr.
hertzberg,
your
time
has
expired.
mr.
horowitz,
you
have
seven
minutes.
mr.
horowitz,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
before
you
get
started
because
it's,
you
know,
been
troubling
me
ever
since
you
sat
down.
the
statute
says
by
appropriate
process
such
attendance,
testimony,
production
of
books,
papers,
and
records.
do
you
think
a
trial
judge
would
have
the
authority
to
allow
a
responding
party
to
produce
summaries
rather
than
original
documents?
say,
he
asked
for
all
the
accounting
records
of
general
motors
or
something.
they
could
say,
well,
we'd
like
to
give
summaries.
and
then
set
up
a
procedure
for
verifying
the
summaries?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
horowitz.
the
case
is
submitted.
