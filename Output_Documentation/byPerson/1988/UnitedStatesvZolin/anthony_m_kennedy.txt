justice
kennedy
are
you
aware
of
cases
in
which
enforcement
has
been
denied?
justice
kennedy
yes.
justice
kennedy
in
the
stuart
case
issued
just
a
few
years...
a
few
weeks
ago,
counsel,
we
said
that
once
the
irs
shows
that
it's
entitled
to
the
order,
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
justice
kennedy
well,
what
if
it
had?
justice
kennedy
well,
but
we
have
to
write
the
opinion
and
you're
arguing
that
there
should
be
a
rule
that
gives
the
district
court
some
authority
to
control
the
irs.
so,
we're
certainly
entitled
to
inquire
what
the
dimensions
of
the
rule
are
that
you're
proposing.
justice
kennedy
counsel,
if
we
can
go
back
to
the
crime-fraud
exception
for
a
moment.
justice
kennedy
is
it
your
position
that
the
government
simply
submitted
excerpts
of
the
tape
and,
therefore,
it's
not
in
a
position
to
complain
that
it
was
error
for
the
court
not
to
listen
to
the
whole
tape?
justice
kennedy
but
you
think
that
on
this
record
the
failure
to
listen
to
the
whole
tape
is
properly
before
us?
justice
kennedy
because
on
the
excerpts
were
submitted?
justice
kennedy
i
understand
that.
