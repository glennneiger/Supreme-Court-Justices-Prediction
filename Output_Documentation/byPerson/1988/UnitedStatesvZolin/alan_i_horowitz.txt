mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
summons
enforcement
case
presents
two
distinct
issues.
first,
the
authority
of
the
district
court
to
place
a
condition
on
its
enforcement
order
requiring
the
irs
to
return
to
the
court
for
prior
approval
of
certain
uses
of
a
summon
material.
and,
second,
the
correctness
of
the
standard
applied
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
ruling
upon
respondents'
claim
of
attorney/client
privilege
for
one
of
the
summoned
documents.
i
will
turn
my
attention
initially
and
primarily
to
the
first
question,
which
has
major
implications
for
the
effective
conduct
of
irs
investigations
generally.
respondents
here
oppose
the
enforcement
of
the
irs'
summons
on
the
ground
that
it
was
not
issued
in
good
faith.
specifically,
they
alleged
that
the
irs
was
seeking
the
summoned
documents
not
for
use
in
its
own
tax
investigation
of
ron
hubbard
but
for
the
purpose
of
furnishing
the
documents
to
the
department
of
justice
for
use
in
the
defense
of
a
civil
damage
suit
that
had
been
brought
against
federal
officials
by
the
church
of
scientology.
after
a
hearing,
the
district
court
emphatically
rejected
these
allegations
and
ordered
the
summons
enforced.
in
its
order,
the
court
stated,
and
i
quote
from
page
27(a)
at
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
"the
church
has
failed
to
raise
any
doubt
of
the
good
faith
of
the
irs
in
pursuing
this
summons
enforcement
proceeding.
"
and
the
court
went
on
to
state
that
the
agent
did
not
issue
the
summons
for
an
improper
or
collateral
purpose.
at
the
hearing,
the
court
was
even
more
explicit.
and,
again,
i
quote
from
page
45
of
the
joint
appendix.
"there
is
not
an
iota
of
evidence
that
this
summons
is
being
prosecuted
for
any
reason
other
than
to
gather
information
for
the
ongoing
investigation.
"
nevertheless,
faced
with
continued
entreaties
by
respondents'
counsel
that
the
irs'
aim
in
fact
was
to
turn
over
the
summon
material
to
the
justice
department,
and
also
with
the
government's
statement
that
it
had
no
such
intention,
the
court
sua
sponte
placed
a
condition
on
its
enforcement
order.
namely,
the
court
held
that
the
summoned
material
could
not
be
disclosed
to
any
other
government
agency
without
a
prior
order
of
the
court.
and
the
court
went
on
to
suggest
at
the
hearing
that
it
would
issue
such
an
order
if
the
government
could
demonstrate
that
the
proposed
disclosure
complied
with
the
confidentiality
rules
of
section
6103.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
we
recognize,
justice
o'connor,
that
this
particular
restriction
that
was
entered
in
this
case
is
a
narrow
one
and
it's
fairly
benign,
in
fact,
because
the
government
didn't
plan
to
turn
over
any
information,
to
the
justice
department.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
the
probabilities
were--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--that
on
the
facts
of
this
case...
so
it
would
never
have
occasion
to
go
to
the
court
and
nothing
would
happen.
but...
but
it
is
our
contention
that
the
general
principle
that
underlies
the
district
court's,
the
only
way
in
which
its
order
can
be
supported
by
authority,
and
the
principle
that
was
explicitly
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
in
fact
the
broad
one
that
has
the
potential
to
be
extremely
damaging
to
irs
investigations.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
you're
hypothesizing
that
the
district
court
in
fact
finds
that
there's
legitimate
purpose
for
the
summons--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--that's
being
issued?
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
that's
a
somewhat
different
case.
but
our
position
would
be
the
same,
that
in
fact,
as
the
district
court--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--the
district
court's--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
i
don't
know
if--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--we're
better
off
in
a
particular
case.
i
mean,
it's
possible
in
a
particular
case
the
judge
might,
might
find
that
he
needs
to
deny
enforcement
because
he
finds
on
the
facts
that
there's
bad
faith
where
in
fact
under
this
scheme
that
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
have
adopted
he
would
in
fact
enforce
the
summons.
that
may
be,
but
the
structure
that
congress
set
up
for
summons
enforcement,
in
our
view,
does
not
permit
this
kind
of--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--monitoring
of
the
investigation
and
obviously
our
view
was--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--that
on
balance
we're
better
off.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
i
stress
it,
i
think,
because
respondent
in
their
brief
has
gone
on
and
on
about
the
evidence
that
was
placed
before
the
district
court
and
so
i'm
suggesting
that
the
district
court
in
fact
made
such
a
finding.
i
mean,
the
fact
is
that--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--i
mean,
a
close
case
in
what
sense?
a
close
case
as
to
whether
the--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
it's
our
position
that...
that
he
needs
to
make
a
determination
at
the
time
the
summons
is
issued
and
not
to
keep--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--keep--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--i
think
if
you
look--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
because...
because
this
idea...
i
was
going
to
quote
what
the...
in
response
to
justice
o'connor
what
the
court
of
appeals
actually
held
here,
which
is
that
the
district
court's
order
in
this
case
created
a
mechanism
whereby
the
district
court
court
monitor
the
irs'
use
of
the
summoned
documents.
this
is
an
appropriate
exercise
of
the
district
court's
discretion.
now,
this
is
an
extremely
damaging
statement,
extremely
damaging
policy
for
the
courts
to
take
because
it
allows
the
district
courts
to
issue
all
kinds
of
orders
that
will
put
various
restrictions
on
the
irs'
investigation
and
require
the
irs
to
keep
coming
back
to
the
district
court--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
that's
exactly
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief,
there
is
a
presumption
that
the
government
intends
to
comply
with
the
law.
and
courts
cannot
go
out
issuing
orders
just
telling
parties
that
they
have
to
comply
with
the
law.
i
mean,
the
problem
here
is
less
substantive,
especially
in
this
particular
case
where
the
judge
at
least
said
that
he
was
going
to
allow
the
government
to
make
any
disclosure
that
was
authorized
under
section
6103.
but
the
problem
is
procedural.
and
this
court
has
grappled
in
many
different
contexts
with
the
various
procedures
applicable
to
summons
enforcement
proceedings
and
has
constantly
reiterated
the
importance
of
having
summary
enforcement
proceedings
once
it
will
not
interfere
with
the
irs'
investigation.
and
it
is
our
view
that
this
kind
of
regime
under
which
the
courts
will...
well,
maybe
issue
the
summons
for
now
but
keep
looking
to
see
what
the
irs
is
doing
with
the
information,
have
the
irs
come
back
if
they're
going
to
do
something
that's
a
little
questionable,
overall
poses
a
great
threat
to
effective
investigations
and
one
that
outweighs
the
fact
that
it
may
be
in
some
case,
as
justice
stevens
posits,
the
court
may
in
fact
be
impelled
to
deny
enforcement
for
that
reason.
i
think
these
courts'
decisions,
in
addition
to
continually
emphasizing,
as
recently
as
last
month's
decision
in
stuart,
the
summary
nature
of
irs
investigations
also
reflect
the
fact
that
the
summons
enforcement
scheme
has
always
been
understood
as
one
where
the
district
court's
role
is
limited
and
one
that
takes
place
in
one
slice
of
time.
the
district
court
looks
at
the
irs'
summons
when
it's
issue
at
the
time
of
the
enforcement
proceeding
and
decides
at
that
time
whether
the
summons
has
been
issued
in
good
faith
for
a
legitimate
purpose
under
the
statute.
and
at
that
point,
it
decides
either
to
deny
or
to
compel
enforcement.
the
statute
that
gives
the
court
jurisdiction,
gives
it
authority
only
to
compel
enforcement
and,
of
course,
to
decline
to
compel
enforcement.
it
does
not
contemplate--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--i
think
that
if
you're
talking
about
a
protective
order,
say...
let's
say
trade
secrets
which
is
the
example
you
gave--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
when
we
say
no
limits.
i
mean,
obviously
the
judge...
there
are
restrictions
on
the
irs
summons
power.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
and
that's
what
the
district
court
looks
at.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yeah.
we're
talking
about
the
judge
here
imposing
some
new
restriction--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--that's
not
authorized
by
congress.
now,
i
take
it
your
hypothetical
is
a
case
where
if
the
judge
didn't
impose
this
restriction
there
would
be
no
confidentiality
protection
for
the--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--there
is
a
difference
between
a
restriction
and
enforcing
a
summons,
and
a
restriction
in
which
the
court
retains
jurisdiction
to
keep
considering
whether
the
irs
is
acting
properly.
i
mean,
a
judge
obviously
doesn't
have
to
go
just
up
or
down
on
a
summons.
it
can
enforce
the
summons
in
part.
it
may
decide
that
certain
documents
are
not
relevant
to
the
irs'
investigation.
it
may
decide
that
the
summons
is
unduly
burdensome
in
some
way
and--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--that's
right.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
mean,
the
judge's
role
ends
at
the
time
he
makes...
he
makes
a
decision--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--on
whether
the
summons
should
be
enforced
in
a
particular
respect.
and
this
kind
of
restriction...
in
this
case,
we
don't
really
even
understand
why...
why...
it's
conceivably
argued
that
there
should
be
such
a
power
in
the
court.
the...
unlike
the
hypothetical
that
you
gave
about
the
grand
jury,
the
material
is
already
confidential.
this
distinguishes
it
from
all
the
protective
order
cases
that
are
cited
by
respondents.
there
is
no
need
for
the
court
to
go
out
and
protect
the
confidentiality
of
the
material.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no,
he's
not
supposed
to
go
back
to
the
judge.
he's
supposed
to
go
to
a
new
judge
and
bring
a
suit.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
go
to
a
new
judge,
he's...
in
that
case,
he's
claiming
that
there's
been
a
violation
of
section
6103
and
he's
got
remedies
for
that.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no.
i
disagree,
justice
white.
i
mean,
he's
got
his
own
remedies
under
section
6103.
one
of
those
remedies
is
to
bring
a
damage
action
against
the
government
under
section
7431
of
the
code.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
a
judge
is
going
to
decide
it,
but
a
judge...
that
is
an
independent
action
in
which
the...
the
agents
involved
may
or
may
not
have
to
pay
damages.
but
it
doesn't
act
as
a
prophylactic...
as
prior
restraint--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
then
he
would
have
to
go
through
the
usual
hoops
of
getting
injunctive
relief.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
in
this
case
i'm
not
sure
he
could
get
it
because
of
the
tax
anti-injunction
acts.
again,
another...
just
another
manifestation
of
congress'
particular
concern
that
irs
investigations
not
be
hampered
by
continual
court
proceedings
that
interfere
with
them
in
the
middle.
but
i
think
you
have
the
anti-injunction
act--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--i
think,
justice
marshall,
that
would
absolutely
be
erroneous
for
the
court
to
do
that.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
the
court
does
not
have
the
power
to
do
that.
there
are...
congress
has
set
up
very
specific
limitations--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--it's
not
all
right
for
the
irs
to
give
it
to
the
newspapers
because
congress--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--has
provided
that
it
does
not.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
that's
essentially
what
we
have
in
this
case,
the
same
kind
of
order.
the
irs--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--that's
right.
the
court
is
telling
the
irs
that
you
can't
do
something
that
the
irs
already
is
not
allowed
to
do.
there
is
no
purpose
for
such
a--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--no.
they
do
not
have
that
right.
that's
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make.
that
congress
has
already
decided
that
that
material
is
confidential.
and
there
is
no
reason
for
the
court
to
enter
a
new
order
under
penalty
of
contempt--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--i
understand
what
you're
saying.
but
i
think
this
just
goes
back
to
the
basic
point
that
the
chief
justice
made,
which
is
that
the
courts
cannot
go
out
running
around
issuing
orders
telling
various
litigants
to
obey
the
law
that's
already
out
there.
there
are
procedures
for
enforcing
the
laws
and
they
don't
include
having
courts--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--the
procedure
is
the
procedures
provided
for
enforcing
section
6103,
which
is
largely
at
section
7431,
damage
action.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes,
i
have.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
in
the
barrett
case
that's
pending
in
this
court
there
is
one.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i've
seen
several
of
them,
actually.
and
probably
some
of
them
will
percolate
up
here
sooner
or
later.
the
fact
is
that
that
is
the
mechanism
that
congress--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--chose
to
enforce--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
we've
been
trying
to
spare
the
supreme
court
from
this--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--the
statute,
i
think,
was
enacted
in
1976.
section
7431.
well,
let
me
given
an
example
in
a
different
context.
if
there
was
a
freedom
of
information
act
suit
that
was
brought
and...
and
the
requestor
claims
that
he's
entitled...
that
there's
no
exceptions
applicable...
he's
entitled
to
the
documents
and
the
government
has
to
turn
them
over
under
the
foia,
surely
the
judge's
role
in
that
kind
of
a
suit
is
to
look
at
the
freedom
of
information
act
and
decide
whether
the
information
is
protected
or
whether
it
should
be
disclosed.
it's
not
the
judge's
business
to
find
out
what
the
requestor
plans
to
do
with
the
information
after
he
gets
it.
it's
not
the
judge's
concern
whether
the
requestor
is
planning
to
use
it
to
get
more
information
to
run
some
extortion
scheme,
or
something.
that's
just
not
the
judge's
province
in
that
kind
of
suit.
it's
up
to
the
judge
to
decide,
under
the
standards
set
forth
in
foia,
whether
the
information
is
to
be
disclosed.
and
when
the
judge
has
made
that
determination,
he
either
orders
the
information
disclosed
or
not.
and
then
he
is
done.
he
doesn't
tell
the
requestor,
okay,
i'm
going
to
give
you
the
information
but
you
come
back
here
every
six
months
and
i
want
to
make
sure
that
you're
not
using
it
for
some--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--enforcement
of
irs
summons?
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes.
there
have
been
many
cases
where
an
irs
summons
was
denied.
and--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--i
think
i'd
like
to
mention
one
other
policy
point
that's
involved
here
in
addition
to
the
delay
that
can
occur.
actually,
the
delay
can
occur
at
two
stages.
if
these
kinds
of
restrictive
orders
are
permitted,
we
think
(a)
that
it
will
cause
additional
delay
at
the
initial
summons
enforcement
stage
where,
as
opposed
to
the
normal
fairly
summary
proceeding
where
litigants
occasionally
are
challenging
whether
there's
bad
faith
or
good
faith
and
whether
the
summons
should
be
enforced,
there
will
be
a
whole
additional
set
of
litigation
over
what
sort
of
restrictions
are
appropriate
for
which
documents.
they
are
appropriate
and
possible
appeals
from
that
kind
of
litigation.
and
also,
of
course,
down
the
road
you
have
the
problem
of
where
the
irs
is
required
to
come
back
to
the
court
for
permission
to
make
the
particular
use
that's
been
restricted.
even
if
the
court
agrees
with
the
irs
that
the
disclosure,
or
whatever
it
is,
is
permissible,
it's
still
a
serious
problem
because
the
investigation
is
halted
in
the
middle,
the
irs
has
to
run
back
to
the
court.
as
you
know,
they
have
to
get
a
court
date.
they
can't
just
walk
in
that
morning.
and
the
whole
thing
is
halted
for
a
period
of
time.
second,
at
least
in
the
6103
context,
most
of
the
disclosures
that
are
going
to
be
sought
by
the
irs
in
this
connection...
or,
many
of
them
anyway...
are
going
to
come
under
section
6103(k)(6)
which
is
disclosures
that
are
necessary
for
law
enforcement
purposes
for
the
irs
investigation.
i
think
in
order
for
the
irs
to
persuade
the
court
that
the
disclosure
is
necessary
for
that
purpose,
it's
going
to
have
to
give
a
little
bit
of
a
roadmap
of
its
investigation
to
the
court
to
explain
why
the
disclosure
is
necessary.
and
that
obviously
can
inhibit
the
success
of
the
investigation
if
that
kind
of
information
is
provided
to
the
target,
a
problem
that
this
court
alluded
to
in
the
o'brien
case.
i
think
i
should
turn
briefly
now
to
the
attorney/client
question,
if
there
are
no
further
questions
on
the
summons
issue.
the
question
here
is
whether
the
tape
recording
of
a
meeting
between
certain
church
officials
and
their
counsel
is
protected
by
the
attorney/client
privilege
because
the
government
did
not
prove
by
evidence
independent
of
the
communications
themselves
that
the
meeting
was
in
furtherance
of
a
crime
or
fraud.
the
irs
here
produced
as
evidence
that
the
crime-fraud
exception
applied
a
partial
transcript
of
the
tape
that
had
been
furnished
by
an
informant.
and,
in
addition,
because
this
tape
had
actually
been
in
the
possession
of
the
irs
for
a
short
time,
and
an
irs
official
had
listened
to
the
tape,
the
irs
also
proffered
the
affidavit
of
an
irs
agent
describing
the
contents
of
the
tape.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
this
highly-probative
evidence
cannot
be
considered
in
determining
the
applicability
of
the
crime-fraud
exception
because
it
is
not
independent
of
the
communications
itself...
themselves.
the
result
of
the
court
of
appeals
rule
is
that
there
are
going
to
be
cases
where
the
court
knows
to
an
absolute
certainty
that
the
communications
are
not
privileged.
nevertheless,
it
will
be
bound
to
deny
probative
evidence
to
the
factfinder
on
grounds
of
attorney/client
privilege.
this
rule
leads
to
a
perverse
result--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
let
me
say
two
things,
justice
scalia.
first
of
all,
this
case
itself
doesn't
involve
in
camera
inspection
at
all
because
the
government
already
has--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--the
nonindependent
evidence
from
these
other
sources
i
just
mentioned.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
in
that
case,
we
recognize
that
the
district
court
has
discretion
to
deny
in
camera
review.
if
the
government
just
came
in
and
said,
we
want
you
to
look
at
the
documents
in
camera
with
nothing
else,...
i'm
not
saying
they
couldn't
do
it,
but
i
suspect
the
judge
would
deny
it.
and
i
don't
think
we
would
have
any
grounds
for
complaining.
i
think
naturally
any
time
you're
going
to
ask
the
district
court
to
do
something
like
that,
you're
going
to
have
to
come
in
with
some
sort
of
reason
to
make
the
judge
do
it.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
guess
i'm
not.
it
seems
to
me
if
the
district
court
did
do
it
and
in
fact
found
that
the
documents
proved
crime
or
fraud,
i
don't
think
that
would
be
reversible
on
appeal.
i
don't
think
you
could
get
the
attorney/client
privilege
reinstated
on
the
ground
that
the
district
court
shouldn't
have
looked
at
them
in
the
first
place.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i'm
not
sure
how
to
answer
that,
justice
stevens.
it
seems
to
me
unrealistic
to
assume
that
the
government
would
have
no
evidence
of
that.
i
suppose
if
it
had
absolutely
no
reason
other
than
some--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--yes.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes.
how
much
of
it.
and
that,
i
think,
is
a
hard
question
to
answer.
it's
largely--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--in
the
discretion
of
the
court.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes.
i
think
as
a
practical
matter
they
need
something.
but
i--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--don't
really
know
where
to
draw
the
line.
so--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
i
don't
know.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i'm
willing
to
say--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--they
need
something.
you
know,
the
counsel
never
wants
to
concede
anything,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--would
probably
be
mistaken
in
looking
at
documents
with
no
reason
to
suspect
crime
or
fraud
other
than
the
government
begging
them
to
look
at
them.
so,--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--but
i
don't
know
how
to
draw
the
line
exactly
and
it's
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
though,
in
this
case--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--as
i
said,
in
this
case
we
didn't
even...
we're
not
really...
well,
we
did
ask
for
in
camera
review
if
the
court--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--in
fact
wasn't
persuaded
by
what
we
submitted.
but
we
submitted
a
lot
of
nonindependent...
proffered,
at
least,
a
lot
of
nonindependent
evidence
without
the
court
ever
having
to
look
at
the
documents
in
camera.
and
the
court
of
appeals...
under
the
court
of
appeals'
rule
none
of
the--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--this
is
in
probative
of--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--which
information?
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
which
information,
justice
marshall?
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
don't
know.
this
tape
recording
was
made
by
the
respondents
themselves.
this
is
not
a
wiretap.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
your
question.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
my
immediate
reaction
is
no.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
don't
think
they
do.
and
i
don't
think
that
has
anything
to
do
with
the
language
in
the
statute
by
appropriate
process.
they're
just
talking
about
the
court's
ability
to
bring
other
parties
before
the
court
or
to
enforce
its
order
of--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
that's
the
way--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--the
way
the
court
can
compel--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
getting
back
to
what
i
said
before,
there's
a
summons
there
and
if
the
irs
is
entitled
to
enforcement,
the
court
is
supposed
to
compel
enforcement
of
the
summons,
not
change
it.
and
there
has
been
litigation
on
that
kind
of
subject.
i'd
like
to
talk
briefly
about
this
idea
of
abuse
of
process
because
it
seems
to
me
this
is
just
the
core
of
respondents'
argument.
is
that
the
notion
the
courts
have
an
inherent
authority
to
prevent
abuse
of
their
process
basically
gives
them
carte
blanche
in
whatever
sort
of
order
they
want
in
a
case
like
this.
we
don't
deny
there's
inherent
authority
to
control
abuse
of
process,
but
there's
nothing
like
that
going
on
here.
this
is
discussed
at
great
length
by
this
court
in
powell
case
and
follows
through
in
subsequent
summons
enforcement
cases.
we
know
what
abuse
of
process
is
in
this
context
and
it
is
the
issuance
of
a
summons
in
bad
faith
for
an
illegitimate
purpose
that
is
not
encompassed
by
the
congressional
grant
of
authority
and
the
other
is
sort
of
power
criteria.
if
the
court
were...
if
the
irs
were
to
get
a
summons
under
the
circumstances
where
it
did
not
satisfy
those
criteria,
that
would
be
an
abuse
of
the
court's
process,
and
the
court
is
entitled
to
protect
itself
against
that.
and
that's
why
there
is
a
summons
enforcement
proceeding.
in
this
case,
and
in
most
cases,
the
court
looked
at
those
criteria
and
it
found...
and
it
found
quite
unequivocally
that
there
was
no
bad
faith.
that
the
irs
was
entitled
to
enforcement
of
its
summons.
that
ends
the
abuse
of
process
inquiry,
and
it
does
not
give
this
kind
of
carte
blanche
for
the
court
to
go
out
there
to
see
what
the
irs
is
going
to
do
with
the
documents
down
the
road.
and
i
should
mention,
i
guess,
that
all
through
summons
enforcement
law
you
see
that
the
court
does
not
really
take
it
upon
itself
to
worry
about
what
the
irs
does
with
documents
down
the
road.
in
the
lasalle
case,
of
course,
there
was
a
great
controversy
over
whether
the
summons
should
be
enforced
there
because
of
the
danger
at
that
time
information
would
immediately
infringe
on
criminal
discovery
and
the
role
of
the
grand
jury
because
there
had
already
been
a
criminal
referral
in
effect.
but,
of
course,
in
the
typical
irs
investigation
where
there
is
no
criminal
referral
in
effect,
documents
are
furnished
to
the
irs
pursuant
to
a
summons
and
then
later
on
down
the
road,
a
year
later,
a
year
and
a
half
later,
the
case
may
be
referred
to
the
justice
department
for
criminal
prosecution.
and
that
information
that
came
through
the
summons
goes
to
the
justice
department
at
that
point.
and
there's
nothing
wrong
with
that.
that
doesn't
show
abuse
of
the
court's
process
or
bad
faith,
or
anything
like
that.
the
idea
of
the
summons
enforcement
proceeding
is
to
decide
at
that
time
whether
the
summons
should
be
enforced.
as
far
as
the
benignness
of
this
particular
restriction,
we
think
the
real
problem
here
is
that
there
is
no
way
to
draw
a
line
between
the
kind
of
restriction
that
the
court
imposed
here
and
much
broader
and
more
intrusive
restrictions.
if
the
court
has
the
authority
to
monitor
the
irs'
investigation,
as
the
ninth
circuit
says,
then
there
will
be
other...
a
lot
of
litigation
and
a
lot
of
other
restrictions
that
are
very
damaging.
just
to
quickly
summarize
the
attorney/client
issue.
of
course,
we
don't
concede
that
there
is
any
independent
evidence
requirement.
when
i
was
induced
to
concede
that
the
district
court
would
have
to
at
least
have
some
evidence
before
it
made
an
in
camera
inspection,
there's
certainly
no
reason
why
that
evidence
has
to
be
independent
in
the
sense
that
respondent
was
talking
about.
neither
the
court
of
appeals
nor
respondents
have
given
any
reason
why
there
should
be
such
a
rule,
and
we
suggest
that
there
shouldn't
be
one.
but,
again,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
court
is
precluded
from
ever
looking
at
so-called
nonindependent
evidence
before
it
decides
whether
the
attorney/client
privilege
should
be
taken
away
because
of
crime-fraud.
thank
you.
