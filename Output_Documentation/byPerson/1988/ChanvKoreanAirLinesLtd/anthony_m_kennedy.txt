m.

well,
your
case--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
i
has
going
to
say,
your
case
would
be
much
different,
would
it
not,
if
the
language
in
articles
4
and
articles...
and
the
other
articles
on
waybills
were
not
there.
then
we'd
have
a
very
different
case,
would
we
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
any
reason
that
you
can
divine
for
having
the
statement
in
baggage
and
waybill
portions
of
the
ticket
but
not
the
passenger
ticket?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
would
seem
to
work
the
other
way
around.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
this
history
that
you
refer
to
really
part
of
the
amendment
offered
by
greece
or
is
it
in
some
other
part
of
the
negotiations
or
is
it
just
an
inference?
