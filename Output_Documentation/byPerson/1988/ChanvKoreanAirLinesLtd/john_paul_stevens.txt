mr.
tompkins,
can
i
interrupt
you?
there
is
a
sanction
that
applies
if
no
ticket
at
all
is
delivered.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
purpose
of
applying
that
sanction
for
that?
why
is
delivering
no
ticket
at
all
any
different
from
delivering
a
ticket
at
all
any
different
from
delivering
a
ticket
that
doesn't
contain
the
information
that
passenger
would
like
to
have?
justice
john
paul
stevens
wouldn't
he
have
been
have
had
all
those
rights
even
if
he
didn't
have
the
ticket
as
long
as
he
was
a
passenger
on
the
plane?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
didn't
they
all
use
uniform
tickets,
standard
forms?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean,
you're
telling
me...
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
what
you're
saying...
you're
saying
that
the
reason
it
was
important
to
give
the
passenger
the
ticket
was
so
the
passenger
could
prove
that
the
air
line
had
agreed
to
be
subject
to
the
warsaw...
all
the
convention's
requirements?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
how
should
the
passenger
prove
that
if
he
didn't
have
a
ticket?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
sounds
crazy
to
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
couldn't
and
comply
with
the
treaty.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
just
told
me
that
the
carrier
could
not
exonerate
itself
from
liability
by
putting
something
in
that
contract
that
would
be
exculpatory.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
saying
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
the
carrier
did
that,
it
could
get
away
with
it
if
it
didn't
deliver
a
ticket?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
fail
to
under...
i
just...
maybe
i'm
just
dumb,
but
i
don't
understand
why
the
passenger
needed
the
ticket
to
establish
his
rights
if
he
could
prove
he
was
a
passenger
on
that
flight.
