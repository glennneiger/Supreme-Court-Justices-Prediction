mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
i
could
pick
up
on
one
of
the
questions,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
that
you
asked
mr.
lazarus,
the
ten
point
type
size
is
a
usa
requirement
only.
there
is
no
other
party
to
the
warsaw
convention
that
requires
any
type
size
or,
in
fact,
recognizes
that
the
warsaw
convention
as
drafted
in
1929
requires
any
notice
for
the
limitation
of
liability
to
apply.
so,
it
is
a
peculiar
u.s.
requirement.
in
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
--that
is
correct
under
the
original
1929
warsaw
convention.
under
the
1955
hague
protocol
to
which
many
nations
are
parties,
notice
is
required
specifically,
because
that
was
one
the
amendments
insisted
upon
by--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
--no,
this
case
is
not
subject
to
the
hague
protocol.
this
case
is
subject
to--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
--the
original
1929
treaty
unamended
by
any
provision.
justice
o'connor
asked
about
or
suggested
that
perhaps
there
was
some
confusion
in
the
drafting
history
of
the
warsaw
convention,
and
i
submit,
your
honor,
with
respect
that
the
drafting
history
is
absolutely
clear,
that
the
parties
in
warsaw
in
1929
deliberately
considered
imposing
a
sanction
for
the
absence
of
any
of
the
particulars
in
article
3(1)
including
the
statement.
they
adopted
the
greek
proposal.
the
japanese
proposal
became
academic.
the
sanction
was
specifically
limited
to
the
failure
to
deliver
a
ticket
at
all.
and
as
the
greek
proposal
was
adopted,
the
japanese
proposal
to
impose
the
sanction...
to
remove
the
sanction
for
clerical
errors
became
academic.
now,
what
has
changed,
if
the
court
please,
in
the
20
years
since
i
stood
before
this
court
and
urged
the
reversal
of
the
lisi
case
as
judicial
treaty
making,
the
only
thing
that
has
changed
in
20
years
is
that
for
the
first
time
a
lower
court
has
refused
to
blindly
follow
the
lisi
rationale
of
cases
and
has
stepped
back
and
taken
a
fresh
look
at
what
this
treaty
was
intended
to
accomplish,
has
taken
a
fresh
look
at
the
language
of
the
treaty,
has
given
the
language
of
the
treaty
its
clear
and
plain
meaning,
has
taken
a
fresh
look
at
the
context
in
which
the
treaty
language
is
used,
has
taken
a
fresh
look
at
what
the
united
states
has
been
striving
to
achieve
since
1953,
without
success,
to
amend
the
treaty.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
perhaps...
if
your
honor
please,
perhaps
i
was
more
persuasive
there
than
i
was
here
20
years
ago.
[laughter]
and
the
court
also
recognized
in
that
20
years
at
least
seven
or
eight
nations
had
expressed
disagreement
with
the
lisi
case,
including
the
supreme
court
of
canada.
and
what
the
court
held
was
that
the
concept
of
notice
is
not
a
part
of
the
warsaw
convention,
so
that
the
treaty
limitation
does
not
apply
without
notice.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
the
history
reveals,
if
your
honor
please,
that
in
1925
when
the
draft
convention
was
first
put
together,
it
included
forms
of
transportation
documents
which
the
parties
were
going
to
consider
making
mandatory
in
the
treaty.
those
forms
were
abandoned.
the
purpose
of
the
ticket
was
to
give
the
passenger
evidence
upon
the
basis
of
which
he
could
establish
that
this
new
regime
of
liability
rules
which
were
new
and
which
gave
the
passenger
substantial
rights
in
1929...
we
may
scoff
at
that
today,
but
in
1929
when
this
treaty
was
drawn
up,
air
carriers
could
exclude
liability
by
contract
simply
by
putting
a
provision
in
the
contract
of
transportation
that
if
we
injure
you
or
kill
you,
we
shall
not
liable.
and
those
provisions
were
upheld
in
the
continental
countries
which
drew
up
the
convention.
so,
the
purpose
of
the
ticket
was
to
give
the
passenger
evidence
so
that
he
would
be
able
to
establish
that
he
was
subject
to
this
new
regime
of
liability,
that
the
uniform
liability
rules
would--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
--he
would
not
be
in
a
position
unless
he
was
able
to
obtain
the
carriers'
copy
of
the
contract
to
establish
his
rights,
and
in
order
to
ensure--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
--well,
the
parties--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
--the
history
seems
to
indicate--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
--no,
they
abandoned
the
idea
of
using
a
standard
form,
and
the
idea
that
the
drafters
adopted
was
that
we
would
like
the
air
line
industry
to
develop
its
own
form
of
ticketing.
we
only
ask
that
the
tickets
be
uniform,
and,
of
course,
that
has
happened.
the
uniform
tickets
were
adopted
by
the
industry
and
remain
today.
the
sanctions--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
--no,
it's
more
than
that,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
it's
to
put
the
passenger
who's
on
the
aircraft
in
a
position
to
establish
himself
as
a
passenger
traveling
in
international
transportation
so
that
his
rights
and
the
airline's
liabilities
would
be
determined
by
this
uniform
international
law
rather
than
local
or
domestic
law
that
might
otherwise
apply,
depending
upon
where
the
event
occurred.
that
was
the
purpose.
and
to
make
it...
it
was
made
mandatory
for
the
airlines,
compulsory
to
deliver
a
ticket
by
imposing
the
sanction
in
article
3(2),
that
if
you
accept
a
person
as
a
passenger
without
a
ticket
having
been
delivered,
then
you
shall
not
be
entitled
to
limit
or
exclusion
for
liability.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
from
the--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
--well,
the
contract
of
transportation,
if
your
honor
please,
could
be
a
completely
separate
document.
the
contract
of
transportation
could
be
oral.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
yes,
it
could,
if
your
honor
please,
as
long
as
you
have
a
contract
of
transportation.
we're
dealing
in
the
treaty
with
a
contract
right
of
action,
not
a
tort
right
of
action.
a
contract
right
of
action.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
that's
what
this
treaty
accomplished.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
that's
what
this
treaty
changed.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
no,
it
could
not,
because
there's
another
provision
in
this
treaty
that
provides
that
any
provision
in
the
contract
which
tends
to
alter
these
liability
rules
is
null
and
void.
so,
the
carrier
could
not
do
that
in
the
contract.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
and
this
whole
concept--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
--it
gave
him
evidence
of
his
contract
of
transportation.
that
i
can
only
suggest,
your
honor,
is
all
that
the
history
reveals.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
obviously
i
would
be
a
passenger,
if
your
honor
please,
if
i've
been
injured
or
killed
on
your
airplane.
i
was
on
there
in
some
capacity.
i
wasn't
a
crew
member.
now,
in
order
to
establish...
i
wasn't
a
stowaway,
so
i
am
a
passenger.
i
am
being
flown
from
london
to
paris
on
your
airplane.
and
now
a
claim
arises
and
either
myself,
if
i
survive,
or
my
heirs
if
i
don't,
want
to
sue
the
airline.
and
this
law...
this
treaty
was
designed
to
provide
a
uniform
international
law
for
that
very
right
of
action.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
the
history
of
the
drafting
of
the
treaty
does
not
reflect
any
concern
of
that
nature,
if
your
honor
please.
it
might
have
been
there.
there
might
have
been
instances
where
passengers
rushed
up
to
an
airplane
in
the
1925-1926
era
and
the
airline
said
go
ahead
and
get
on
and
i'll
take
you
to
paris.
but
there's
no
reflection
in
the
history
as
to
whether
that
was
a
concern.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
korean
air
lines
signed
a
counterpart
to
the
montreal
agreements
yes.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
i
wish...
i
wish
i
had
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor
and
it's
not
an
uncommon
occurrence.
it's
not
limited
just
to
korean
air
lines.
i
can
offer
this
explanation
as
to
how
it
happened.
korea
is
a
party
to
the
hague
protocol
amending
the
warsaw
convention.
the
hague
protocol
requires
a
specific
notice
that
the
convention
applies
and
limits
the
carrier's
liability.
the
hague
protocol
provides
that
if
you
do
not
give
that
notices,
the
sanction
in
article
3(2)
will
apply.
the
international
carriers
through
the
international
transport
association
agreed
that
that
notice
would
be
printed
in
eight
point
type.
and
throughout
the
world,
those
tickets
are
printed
in
eight
point
type
with
korean
air
lines
having
their
tickets
printed
outside
of
the
united
states,
even
though
they
are
committed
to
issue
a
montreal
advice
in
ten
point
type,
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
printer
uses
the
same
type
size
for
the
hague
notice,
which
is
a
separate
part
of
the
ticket,
and
the
montreal
advice.
i
can
offer
no
explanation
other
than
that.
it
is
not
a
deliberate
course
of
conduct.
if
it
were
a
deliberate
course
of
conduct
on
the
part
of
any
foreign
air
carrier
flying
to
this
country,
as
chief
judge
robinson
in
the
district
court
suggested
and
the
civil
aeronautics
board,
now
the
department
of
transportation,
has
ample
authority
to
revoke
the
permit
or
to
take
other
enforcement
action.
the
montreal
agreement,
if
your
honor
please,
does
not
amend
the
warsaw
convention.
the
montreal
agreement
supplemented
the
limit
of
liability
and
was
a
compromise
which
was
arrived
at
at
the
insistence
of
the
united
states
as
a
condition
to
it
remaining
a
party
to
the
warsaw
convention.
the
united
states
sought
to
have
the
world
community
agree
to
a
minimum
of
$100,000
limit
of
liability
in
1965-66
or,
alternatively,
no
limit.
the
warsaw
convention
is
a
treaty
to
which
the
united
states
has
adhered
for
some
54
years
and
continues
to
urge
adherence
to
the
treaty.
in
fact,
the
senate
next
year
will
be
called
upon
to
consider
again
the
most
recent
protocols,
montreal
protocols
3
and
4,
to
further
amend
the
treaty.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
yes,
in
1965,
if
your
honor
please,
the
united
states
served
a
notice
of
denunciation
of
the
warsaw
convention
effective
in
may
of
1966
as
a
direct
result
end
as
the
sole
reason,
the
limit
of
liability.
the
united
states
sought
to
get
the
rest
of
the
community
party
to
the
convention
to
agree
to
a
much
higher
limit
of
liability.
that
didn't
work.
the
emergency
meeting
called
in
montreal
by
the
international
civil
aviation
organization
in
january
and
february
of
1966
was
a
total
failure.
the
rest
of
the
world
there
were
now
in
the
united
states
adhered
to
the
warsaw
convention.
there
were
perhaps
30
countries
parties.
in
1965
there
were
perhaps
75
or
85
countries,
and
the
rest
of
the
world
wasn't
concerned
about
the
tort,
escalation
of
awards
in
tort
cases
in
the
united
states.
they
were
concerned
about
this
international
treaty.
so,
they
would
not
agree
to
a
higher
limit.
at
the
eleventh
hour
through
the
thought
and
the
genius
of
our
state
department,
and
the
gentleman
responsible
is
here
in
the
room
today,
brought
up
this
idea
of
a
special
contract
under
article
22(1).
let's
get
the
airlines.
forget
the
countries.
let's
get
the
airlines
to
agree
to
this
higher
limit
of
$75,000
and
in
order
to
ensure
speedy
and
adequate,
adequately
perceived
recovery,
we'll
have
them
waive
their
defenses
under
article
20,
by
which
you
can
avoid
all
liability
under
the
convention
as
an
air
carrier.
and
that
was
done.
and
the
airlines
readily
agreed.
the
united
states
accepted
that
as
an
interim
arrangement,
an
interim
compromise
pending
continuing
negotiations
to
amend
the
treaty
to
achieve
even
a
higher
limit
of
liability.
and
as
a
result
of
that,
the
united
states
withdrew
its
notice
of
denunciation
the
day
before
it
would
have
become
effective.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
according
to
the
lisi
case,
your
honor,
that
would
be
an
issue
of
fact
for
a
jury.
however,
it
is
our
position
reading
the
treaty
that
no
notice
is
required.
so
that
if
there's
nothing
in
the
ticket,
the
situation
is
the
same,
whether
it's
one
point
type
or
twenty
point
type--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
--nothing.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
because
if
you
go,
go
right
to
the
treaty
language,
if
your
honor
please,
even
the
statement
in
article
3(1)(e)
is
only
a
statement
that
the
liability
rules
of
the
warsaw
convention
apply
to
the
transportation.
it
doesn't
mention
anything
about
a
limit
of
liability.
and
you
would
have
to
search
long
and
far
to
find
out
what
the
limit
of
liability
might
be
that
applies
to
you.
and
if
you
go
to
the
treaty,
you'll
find
it's
in
french
francs
and
then
you'll
have
to
go
somewhere
else
to
find
out
what
that
means
in
dollars
to
me,
and
then
you'll
have
to
go
somewhere
else
to
find
out
if...
was
this
a
hague
amendment
case?
is
this
a
warsaw
case?
is
this
a
montreal
case?
which
limit
applies
to
me?
so,
it's
very
clear
from
the
drafting
history
of
the
treaty
and
from
the
language
of
the
treaty
itself
that
notice
is
not
a
concept
that
is
permitted
under
the
treaty
as
a
precondition
to
the
application
of
the
limitation
of
liability.
this
concept
of
notice
is
a
tort
concept,
and
it
evolved
in
this
country
in
the
fifties
and
the
sixties
and
seventies
and
is
continuing
to
evolve.
the
imposition
of
tort
concepts
on
contract
causes
of
action.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
with
respect,
your
honor,
it
was
not.
and
let
me
give
you
the
history
on
that.
in
1953,
as
a
result,
i
submit,
of
the
famous
jane
froman
case,
arising
out
of
the
uso
tour
accident
in
lisbon
in
1943
in
19...
which
resulted
in
litigation
ending
in
1949
where
jane
froman,
who
had
been
with
the
uso
troupe
recovered
the
sum
of
$8,300
for
her
substantial
injuries.
the
united
states
suddenly
became
aware
at
the
government
level
there's
something
wrong
here
because
she
never
saw
her
ticket,
she
never
agreed
to
a
limitation
on
liability,
and
she
didn't
even
know
she
was
going
to
lisbon.
now
in
1953
the
united
states
decided
to
take
steps
at
the
diplomatic
level
to
amend
the
treaty,
and
one
of
those
steps
was
to
require
notice
of
the
limitation
of
liability
in
the
convention
amount,
specifically
in
the
notice,
in
contrasting
color,
in
a
minimum
type
size.
and
in
1955
the
united
states
was
able
to
persuade
the
rest
of
the
international
community
to
agree
to
the
notice,
but
not
the
color,
not
the
type
size,
and
not
the
amount,
just
the
notice,
in
the
hague
protocol.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
finally
when
the
senate
acted
upon
that
in
1965,
the
senate
said
it
would
give
advice
and
consent
if
there
was
complementary
congressional
legislation
adding
an
additional
amount
of
$50,000
per
passenger.
that
legislation
was
to
have
been
acted
upon
within
that
congress.
it
didn't,
and
the
united
states
served
notice
of
denunciation
from
the
warsaw
convention.
but
the
important
thing
is:
the
united
states
signed
the
hague
protocol
in
1956.
it
went
to
the
senate
in
1959
and
nothing
happened.
and
so
in
1963
the
civil
aeronautics
board
took
it
upon
itself,
acting
in
the
public
interest,
under
its
statutory
authority
to
require
carriers
operating
to,
from,
or
through
the
united
states
as
a
matter
of
regulation
to
give
the
hague
notice.
and
that
was
the
origin
of
what
ultimately
became
the
montreal
advice
because--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
--that
is
correct.
and
that
is
in
all
the
tickets.
it's
in
three
times
in
tickets.
it's
in
in
the
montreal
advice.
it's
in
in
the
hague
advice,
and
it's
in
in
the
warsaw
advice.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
yes,
it
did.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
well,
it
was
in
various
sizes.
in
the
montreal
advice
the
statement
was
eight
point
type.
in
the
hague
statement,
i
believe,
it
was
eight
point
type,
and
in
the
warsaw
statement
it
might
have
even
been
smaller,
i'm
not
sure.
but
the
statement
was
in
the
ticket.
there's
no
question
about
that.
but
the
important
thing
is
that
even
if
it
weren't
there,
even
if
it
weren't
there,
the
intent
of
the
parties
to
the
treaty
is
absolutely
clear
through
55
years
that
the
application
of
the
limitation
of
liability
does
not
depend
upon
the
carrier...
the
passenger
having
notice
of
the
limitation
of
liability
either
express
or
implied.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
well,
it
is,
if
your
honor
please,
it
is
to
me.
when
i
read
article
3.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
particularly
when
i
read
article
3
in
the
context
of
articles
4,
8
and
9.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
it
would
not
be
as
clear
from
the
plain
language
of
the
treaty.
we
would
then
have
to
depend
more
upon
the
history
of
the
drafting
as
to
why
that
came
about,
i
agree
with
you,
yes.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
the
history
indicates
that
the
only
reason
that
this
decision
was
taken
was
that
the
parties
considered
it
too
severe
to
impose
unlimited
liability
and
absolute
liability
because
your
defenses
are
stripped
as
well
for
an
error
in
the
ticket,
for
the
omission
of
one
of
the
particulars
in
the
ticket.
and
putting
that
passenger
in
the
same
category
with
respect
to
the
airline
as
if
the
airline
were
guilty
of
wilful
misconduct.
the
only
other
circumstance
in
the
treaty
where
the
limit
can
be
broken
and
the
very
situation
that
confronts
the
people
in
this
unfortunate
disaster
would
happen,
the
situation
that
the
parties
did
not
want
to
happen.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
the
understanding,
as
i
gather
it
from
the
history,
if
your
honor
please,
is
that
with
baggage
and
with
cargo,
the
users
of
air
transportation
would
be
more
used
to
taking
out
insurance
and
protecting
themselves
individually.
now,
this
is
all
i
can
gather
from
the
history.
there
was
a
distinction
made.
it's
difficult
to
understand
why--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
--it
is
difficult
to
understand
why
the
human
passenger,
the
human
life
was
treated
differently
than
baggage
and
cargo,
but
the
fact
is
it
was.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
no,
it's,
i
submit,
in
the
minutes
of
the
warsaw
conference
in
1929
which
we
have
cited
repeatedly
in
our
brief
in
the
english
translation
by
mr.
horner.
the
original
french
minutes
are
quite
clear
as
well.
the
discussion
which
is
reported
by
mr.
de
vos
in
1929
revolved
around
the
greek
proposal
which
had
been
made
before
the
conference
was
convened
that
this
would
be
too
severe
a
sanction
for
a
mere
clerical
error.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
a
passenger
with
a
defective
ticket--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
--i
don't
read
mr.
de
vos'
statement
that
way,
if
your
honor
please.
i
read
it
exactly
the
opposite.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
this,
if
your
honor
please
is
the
opening
report
of
mr.
de
vos
to
the
conference
describing
the
draft
convention
which
had
been
prepared
in
paris
in
1925,
which
the
countries
were
meeting
to
discuss.
this
is
not
the
final
draft
that
was
adopted
at
the
conference
in
1925.
and
if
i
could
refer
you,
if
your
honor
please,
and
i
will
refer
specifically
to
the
french
minutes
at
pages
mr.
horner's
book
at
page
150-151,
where
mr.
de
vos--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
i
refer
you
to
the
full
discussion
of
the
development
of
that
draft
on
pages
12-19
of
the
respondent's
brief.
there
is
a
full
discussion
with
the
references
there
as
to
exactly
how
article
3
paragraph
2
came
to
be
what
it
is
today,
what
it
was
in
1929
and
what
it
is
today.
and
what
mr.
de
vos
reported
after
the
drafting
committee
had
dealt
with
the
1925
draft
in
light
of
the
greek
suggestion,
what
he
reported
to
the
conference
when
article
3
was
adopted
was...
the
grafting
committee
has
deleted
from
the
draft
the
sanction,
the
following
words
on
the
last
line
of
article
3(2):
"or
if
the
ticket
does
not
contain
the
particulars
indicated
above.
"
those
words
which
were
in
the
draft
were
stricken
before
the
article
was
adopted,
and
that
was
what
the
parties
did.
and
yet,
the
petitioners
and
the
government
argue
now
well,
it's
been
there
all
along
anyway.
in
conclusion,
if
your
honors
please,
the
trend
of
judicial
treaty
writing
to
find
new
ways
to
avoid
what
is
considered
to
be
distasteful,
anachronistic
and
inadequate
limitation
of
liability
in
this
treaty
was
arrested
by
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
i
submit
that
that
decision
is
a
correct
interpretation
of
the
treaty.
it
is
consistent
with
the
wording
of
the
treaty.
it
is
consistent
with
the
history
of
the
treaty.
in
fact,
both
mandate
that
decision.
the
united
states
is
considering
further
amendments
to
the
treaty
to
perpetuate
its
existence
as
the
supreme
law
of
this
land,
and
i
submit
that
it
is
very
important
for
the
rest
of
the
world
to
knew
that
when
the
united
states
commits
itself
to
a
treaty,
it
will
be
applied
as
intended
by
the
lower
courts
of
this
country.
and
i
urge
for
that
reason
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
