chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
87-1055,
elisa
chan
versus
korean
air
lines,
limited.
mr.
sincoff,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
does
that
depend
on
the
type
size,
the
reasonableness
of
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
can
see
how
you
can
argue
that
the
convention
says
10
point
type
and
there
is
no
way
of
getting
around
it.
but
to
say
that
it
requires
something
reasonable
and
the
difference
between
reasonable
and
unreasonable
is
two
points
of
type
size
doesn't
make
any
sense
at
all
to
me.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
why
talk
about
reasonableness.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
now
cutting
into
your
colleague's
time,
mr.
sincoff.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lazarus.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
--well,
how
does
the
word
"nevertheless"
beginning
the
next
sentence
fit
in
with
your
interpretation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
this
a
standard
generally
enforced
by
all
the
warsaw
people,
the
ten
point
type
size?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lazarus.
mr.
tompkins,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
didn't
it
come...
didn't
the
u.s.
come
pretty
close
to
pulling
out
in
the
sixties?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
section
1(e)
of
article
3
of
the
convention
requires
a
statement
that
the
transportation
is
subject
to
the
rules
relating
to
liability?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
the
ticket
in
this
case
contain
that
sort
of
statement?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in...
in
what,
eight
point
type?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
is
not
necessarily
clear
from
a
reading
of
article
3,
is
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
tompkins.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
87-1055,
chan
versus
korean
airlines
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
