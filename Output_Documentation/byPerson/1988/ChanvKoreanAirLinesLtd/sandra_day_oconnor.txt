justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
sincoff,
may
i
inquire
of
you
whether
you
agree
that
article
3
of
the
warsaw
convention
is
operative
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
under
that
article
it
seems
to
indicate
that
the
sanction
of
removing
the
liability
limit
applies
only
if
the
ticket
hasn't
been
delivered
at
all.
apparently
there
are
other
countries
who
are
parties
to
that
convention
that
have
taken
that
view.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
why
should
we
take
a
different
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
mean,
you
would
take
the
position
that
if
there
are
some
typographical
error
on
date
or
place
of
destination
or
origin
on
the
ticket
that
the
liability
limit
is
forfeited?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
think
there's
confusion
in
the
drafting
history
as
to
whether
any
of
those
things
were
sufficient
to
cause
removal
of
the
liability
limit.
that
is
not
at
all
clear.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
oh,
in
your
brief.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
provisions
for
the
baggage
check
are
more
specific,
are
they
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
of
course,
there
is
a
statement
here.
it
was
just
in
eight
point
type.
i
mean,
there
is
a
statement.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
perfectly
readable.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we
have
copies
here
in
our
material.
i
mean--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--there
is
no
mistake
what
the
statement
says.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
lazarus,
japan
offered
an
amendment
at
the
time
of
the
warsaw
convention
to
make
this
position
clear,
and
it
was
not
adopted.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--article
3
was
to
clarity
the
forfeiture
of
the
limitation,
liability
limitation
was
not
adopted.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
then
show
it
to
me
in
article
3,
because
i
don't
find
it
in
the
language.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
then,
how
do
you
deal
with
the
irregularity
word?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
tompkins,
korea
signed
the
montreal
agreement,
is
that
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
mind
telling
me
why
they
don't
print
the
tickets
in
ten
point
type
as
they
agreed
to
do?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
there
were
one
point
type
in
the
printed
notice
instead
of
eight
point?
have
they
included
the
required
statement
under
article
3
of
the
warsaw
convention?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
no
notice
at
all?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
certainly
the
concept
of
notice
was
terribly
important
to
this
country
for
its
decision
to
continue
to
adhere
to
the
convention.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
didn't
sign?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr.
de
vos'
statement,
thought,
supports
the
petitioners
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let's
look
at
i
t
again.
i
thought
he
said
at
page
a-86
in
the
petitioners'
brief
that
the
sanction
provided
for
carriage
of
passengers
without
a
ticket
or
with
a
ticket
not
conforming
to
the
convention
is
identical
to
that
provided
for
the
carriage
of
baggage
and
goods.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
something
before
us
here?
can
you
refer
us
to
anything--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
our
set
of
briefs?
