mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondent's
reading
of
the
warsaw
convention
rests
an
two
untenable
propositions:
first,
that
the
parties
to
the
convention
went
out
of
their
way
to
impose
a
sanction
on
an
air
carrier
for
failing
to
deliver
a
ticket
to
the
passenger.
then
they
didn't
care
whether
that
ticket,
once
delivered,
was
essentially
a
blank
piece
of
paper;
and,
second,
that
the
parties
to
the
convention
concluded
that
its
liability
limitations
should
not
apply
in
the
absence
of
notice
of
them
on
a
banker's
check
or
airway
bill,
but
concluded
that
they
should
apply
in
the
absence
of
such
notice
on
a
passenger
ticket.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
no,
the
japanese
amendment
was
adopted.
the
japanese
amendment
was
proposed...
was
to
list
the
liability
limitation
notice
which
had
previously
been
in
a
separate
paragraph
and
not
listed
as
one
of
the
listed
particulars
as
a,
b,
c,
or
d;
listed
among
those
particulars
to
make
it
clear
that
the
liability
limitation
would
apply.
the
japanese
amendment
was
proposed
basically
parallel
to
the
greek
amendment,
and
it
was
adopted,
and
it
had
ironically
the
unattendant
consequent
of
creating
the
negative
implication
upon
which
respondents
rely
here.
but
the
japanese
amendment
was
adopted,
and
that
was
to
lift
the
two
up,
which
was
done
in
article
3--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--and
article
4.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
no,
i
believe
it
was
adopted.
the
amendment--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--what
happened,
justice
o'connor,
is
the
purpose...
the
amendment...
when
the
japanese
proposed
the
amendment
and
drafted
it,
it
was
the
time
before
the
greek
amendment.
it
was
done
in
parallel
to
it.
and
they
thought
that
by
lifting
that
separate
requirement
of
liability
limitation
notice
and
listing
it
specifically
as
a
particular,
as
particular
e,
that
that
would
make
it
clearer
that
the
liability
limitation
would
apply
in
the
absence
of
a
particular
being
on
a
ticket.
and
that's
exactly
what
the
convention...
particular
to
the
convention
did.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
that's
right.
but
the
greek
amendment
was
proposed
at
the
time
that
the
liability
limitation
notice
was
not
separately
listed
under
a,
b,
c
or
d.
and
we
can
look
to
page
116-a
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
and
you
can
see
the
precise--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--no,
it
still
did
have
a
sanction
in
it,
and
that
was
the
sanction--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--well,
basically
what
you
have
is
if
you
look
at
the
language
of
article
3,
you
can
see
that
there's
a
sanction
failing
to
deliver
a
ticket.
we
believe
that
article
3
then
defines
what
a
ticket
is
stating
that
certain
information
must
be
on
it
to
be
a
ticket.
now,
article
3
on
its
face
would
suggest
that
not
having
any
of
those
there
would
trigger
the
liability
limitation.
if
you
then
look
further--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--i
really...
i
think
the
irregularity
point
which
led
the
district
court
astray
is
a
complete
red
herring.
that
provision
provides
that
the...
not
that
the
liability
limitations
of
the
convention
shall
apply
notwithstanding
irregularity,
it
provides
that
the
rules
of
the
convention
including
the
sanctions
shall
apply,
even
given
an
irregularity.
in
other
words,
an
airline
may
not
avoid
the
rules
of
the
convention
in
its
sanctions
simply
by
not
issuing
a
ticket
or
by
issuing
a
ticket
with
an
irregularity.
and
this
point
is
made
repeatedly,
justice
scalia,
throughout
the
treaty
drafting
history
to
make
sure
that
it
wouldn't
be
thought
to
have
that
intent.
if
you
look
at
footnote
9
of
our
brief,
we
describe
all
the
different
citations.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
not--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--right.
but
it
means
that
the
rules
of
the
convention...
the
passenger
won't
lose
his
rights
and
the
airlines
won't
lose
its
right.
but
it's
limited...
the
rules
of
the
convention
include
the
sanctions
themselves,
and
the
fact
that
that
same
language--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--it
includes
the
limitation
on
liability,
conditioned
upon
the
sanction.
the
same
sentence,
justice
scalia,
the
absence
regularly
appears
in
article
4
dealing
with
baggage
checks.
it
appears
in
articles
8
and
9
dealing
with
air
waybills.
it
wasn't
intended
to
be
inconsistent
with
the
sanction
provisions.
and
this
point
is
really
made
quite
clear
in
the
drafting
history.
the
meaning
of
the
provision
is
that
the
rules
of
the
convention,
including
its
sanctions,
apply,
notwithstanding
irregularity
or
loss
or
absence
of
the
ticket.
but
not...
the
airline
could
avoid
the
rules
of
the
convention,
end
its
sanctions
simply
by
issuing
a
ticket
with
an
irregularity.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
basically
that
it
shall,
nevertheless,
that
even
though...
that
there
will
be
a
contract
and
notwithstanding
the
absence
of
a
ticket,
the
loss
of
a
ticket,
an
irregularity
of
the
ticket,
it
shall
nonetheless
remain
subject
to
the
rules
of
the
convention.
and
one
of
those
rules
of
the
convention
is
that
there
will
be
a
sanction
under
certain
circumstances.
and
that
same
provision
applies,
article
3,
article
4,
articles
8
and
9.
and
during
the
negotiations
there
were
several
parties
who
were
concerned
about
just
this
happening,
and
they
said
no,
it
won't.
it
will
not
happen.
if
you
look
basically
at
footnote
9
of
our
brief,
it
gives
all
the
citations.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
no,
the
"nevertheless"
remains
subject
to
the
rules
of
the
convention.
and
the
rules
of
the
convention,
justice
scalia,
include
the
sanctions
for
not
meeting
certain
points.
the
second...
there
are
basically
two
arguments
in
front
of
their
position,
and
the
second
depends
upon
the
comparing
of
the
language
of
article
3
and
article
4.
there,
too,
we
believe
that
if
you
look
at
the
history
of
the
treaty's
drafting,
it's
apparent
that
the
wording,
the
difference
in
wording
between
articles
3
and
4
was
bottomed
on
two
amendments
to
article
3
adopted
at
the
convention
itself,
the
greek
and
the
japanese
amendment,
neither
of
which
was
intended
to
allow
the
liability
limitation
to
apply
in
the
absence
of
notice.
the
second
question
presented
by
this
case,
even
assuming
that
sanction
applies,
concerns
the
accuracy
of
the
notice
that,
in
fact,
appeared
on
the
passenger
tickets
in
this
case.
we
agree
there
with
petitioners
that
type
size
is
relevant
to
that
inquiry
and
that
the
notice
given
on
respondent's
ticket
was
inadequate
to
the
extent
that
it
was
only
eight
point
notice,
eight
point
type.
the
executive
branch
long
ago
announced
its
view
that
ten
point
type
notice
was
required
on
airline
passenger
tickets
to
give
the
public
adequate
notice
of
a
liability
limitation.
now,
we
recognize
that
the
selection
of
any
one
type
size
obviously
contains
some
elements
of
arbitrariness.
the
problem
is
that
individuals,
individual
human
beings,
don't
react
to
varying
type
size
the
way
that
chemical
compounds
such
as
water
react
the
varying
temperatures.
there
are
no
clear
threshold
points.
but
the
necessity
of
such
inevitable
uncertainty,
the
fact
that
it
will
exist,
does
not
cause
us
to
shy
away
in
other
areas
of
the
law
to
come
up
with
a
clear
standard,
and
we
don't
believe
it
should
here
either.
it's
an
adequate
standard,
it's
a
good
standard,
it's
been
known
for
a
long
time,
it's
an--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--as
far
as
i
know,
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
in
the
montreal
agreement
it
is.
and
there's
really
no
unfairness
in
its
application.
they've
known
it
for
a
long
time.
indeed,
the
airlines
agreed
to
adhere
to
the
ten
point
standard
in
1966
in
order
to
persuade
the
united
states
continued
to
adhere
to
the
warsaw
convention.
the
airlines
should
not
now
be
allowed
to
disavow
that
standard
while
depending
on
its
benefits.
