justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
sincoff,
i
don't
understand
that.
do
you
think
the
difference
between
the
skills
of
attorneys
and
non-attorneys
is
that
attorneys
can
read
smaller
print,
is
that--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
and
you
think
if
it's
given
to
a
non-attorney,
it
has
to
be
in
bigger
print?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
sincoff,
the
obligation
you
assert
is
an
obligation
under
the
treaty?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
now,
i
don't
understand
how
that
obligation
gets
supplemented.
the
treaty
is
binding
as
a
matter
of
law--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right?
now,
the
contractual
arrangement
with
other
airlines,
i
assume
your
clients
are
strangers
to
that
contract.
how
does
that
contractual
agreement
become
binding
upon
the
defendant
here
vis-a-vis
your
clients?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
contract--
justice
antonin
scalia
--said
it
should
be
10
point
type--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right,
minimum
of
10
point
type,
and
it
gets
read
back
into
the
treaty
because
you
say
if
the...
if
the
ticket
doesn't
contain
that,
the
treaty
provides
that
there's
no
liability.
explain
to
me--
justice
antonin
scalia
--one
more
thing.
in
section...
in
article
3
of
the
second
paragraph,
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
word
"irregularity"?
if
the
second
paragraph
of
article
3
simply
read,
"the
absence
or
loss
of
the
passenger
ticket
shall
not
effect
the
existence
of
the
validity
of
the
contract
which
will
nonetheless
be
subject
to
the
rules
of
this
convention.
"
i
would
understand
your
position.
but
it
says,
"the
absence,
irregularity
or
loss
of
the
passenger
ticket.
"
what
does
"irregularity"
mean
unless
it
means
something
like
the
passenger
liability
is
in
eight
point
type
instead
of
ten
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
want
to
continue?
"which
shall
nonetheless
be
subject
to
the
rules
of
this
convention--
"
justice
antonin
scalia
--one
of
which
rules
is
the
limitation
on
damages.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
very
irregularity
we're
talking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you've
gone
a
complete
circle.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
you
refer
to
irregularity,
you're
obviously
referring
to
not
having
there
something
that
should
be
there,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
not
having
in
the
ticket
something
that
should
be
in
the
ticket
shall
not
affect
the
validity
of
the
contract
which
shall
nonetheless
be
subject
to
the
rules
of
this
convention--
justice
antonin
scalia
--including
the
rule
that
the
irregularity
is
no
good?
that
makes
the
sentence
meaningless.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
go
back
to
the
beginning
of
the
sentence
and
cancel
it
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
failing
to
state
the
place
and
date
of
issue?
how
does
that...
how
does
paragraph
2
of
article
3
affect
that?
that's
an
irregularity.
it
fails
to
state
the
place
and
date
of
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
am
sure
of
that.
but
what
does
irregularity
of
a
ticket
mean
unless
it
means
the
failure
of
the
ticket
to
contain
one
of
the
things
that
are
required.
surely
it
doesn't
mean
an
irregular
shape.
what
does...
it
must
mean
it's
irregular
in
that
it
does
not
contain
something
it's
supposed
to
contain.
and
the
only
thing
that
the
treaty
says
it
must
contain
are
those
five
items
in
paragraph
3.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
would
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
give
me
an
example
of
what's
referred
to
by
irregularity,
then.
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
loss.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
word
"loss"
is
not
consonant
with
that
meaning.
when
you
say
the
loss
of
the
ticket
won't
affect
anything,
you
obviously
are
saying
not
just
the
sanctions
of
the
convention,
but
any
of
the
rights
of
the
contention.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you're
not
just
trying
to
say,
you
know,
despite
the
fact
that
the
airlines
doesn't
do
what
it's
supposed
to,
it's
going
to
be
liable.
you
also
are
talking
about
the
rights
of
the
passenger
because
it
isn't
the
airline
that's
going
to
have
lost
the
passenger
ticket.
it's
the
passenger.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
don't
include
the
limitation
on
liability.
why
wouldn't
the
rules
include
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
mr.
lazarus.
i
hate
to
have
to
chase
around
legislative
history.
this
thing
seems
to
me
written
very
clearly,
as
the
chief
justice
suggests;
the
nevertheless
thought
is
inconsistent
with
the
meaning
you've
just
given
us.
it
says
"nevertheless"
which
means
although
you
might
have
read
the
preceding
sentence
to
exclude
some
liability
limitation,
it
doesn't
exclude
a
liability
limitation
if
the
carrier
accepted
it
and
so
forth.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
he's
among
the...
well--
--why
punish
him
for
not
having
evidence?
i
mean,
that's
its
own
punishment,
you're
saying,
since
it's
going
to
be
hard
for
you
to
prove
that
you're
a
passengers
we
are
furthermore
going
deprive
you
of
your
rights,
even
if
you
do
prove
you're
a
passenger.
that
doesn't
make
any
sense.
i
agree
with
justice
stevens.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
there
some
worry,
perhaps,
about
people
being
flown
without
tickets
for
some...
was
it
considered
some
form
of
unfair
competition
or
maybe
was
there
worry
about
people
being
flown
into
countries
without...
without
proper
documentation
or
anything
of
that
sort?
that
might
explain
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
was
that
too
severe
for
people
but
it
wasn't
too
severe
for
baggage?
i
think
that's
the
question
that
justice
kennedy
is
asking.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
it
involves
wrongful
death
actions
against--
one
of
its
planes
was
destroyed
by
soviet
aircraft
over
the
sea
of
japan.
all
parties
agreed
that
their
rights
are
governed
by
the
multilateral
treaty
known
as
the
warsaw
convention,
which
provides
a
per
passenger
damages
limitation
for
personal
injury
or
death.
the
convention
provides
that
passenger
tickets
must
include
notice
of
this
limitation.
the
private
accord
among
airlines
known
as
the
montreal
agreement,
prescribes
that
this
notice
shall
be
in
print
size
no
smaller
than
10-point
type.
korea
airlines'
notice
to
its
passengers
on
the
flight
in
question
here
appeared
in
only
8-point
type.
this
case
required
us
to
decide
whether
this
discrepancy
deprived
kal
of
the
benefit
of
the
damages
limitation.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
and
incidentally
agree
with
the
supreme
court
of
canada
in
holding
that
international
air
carriers
do
not
loose
the
benefit
of
the
warsaw
convention's
damages
limitation
if
they
fail
to
provide
notice
of
that
limitation
and
passenger
tickets.
montreal
agreement
concededly
does
no
impose
such
a
sanction
and
such
a
result
is
contrary
to
the
convention's
plain
language.
drafting
history
of
the
convention
maybe
consulted
to
clarify
a
text
that
is
ambiguous
but
where
the
text
is
clear
as
the
warsaw
convention
is
on
this
point.
we
have
no
power
to
insert
an
amendment
into
what
the
signatories
have
formally
adopted.
justice
brennan
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justices
marshall,
blackmun,
and
stevens
joined.
