mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1969,
fourteen
years
before
the
korean
air
lines
airplane
disaster,
korean
air
lines
was
warned
by
the
existing
state
of
the
law
that
it
would
be
liable
under
the
circumstances
claimed
before
this
court
for
actual
compensatory
damages
sustained
by
the
families
of
the
deceased
passengers.
at
that
time
the
state
of
the
law
had
been
articulated
by
three
appellate
court
decisions
of
the
federal
circuits
and
one
of
the
high
court
of
one
state.
in
addition,
the
united
states
government
through
the
solicitor
general,
in
lisi
against
alitalia
airlines
in
which
the
second
circuit
held
the
airline
liable
for
failing
to
give
the
passenger
adequate
notice
of
the
damage
limitation,
this
court
equally
divided
and
therefore
affirmed,
justice
marshall
not
participating.
the
rationale
of
the
appellate
court
decisions
existing
at
the
time
korean
airlines
in
1969
signed
the
montreal
agreement
and
obligated
itself
to
certain
responsibilities,
the
state
of
the
law
at
that
time
was
rather
clear.
it
held
that
both
the
language,
the
literal
language
of
the
warsaw
treaty
required
adequate
notice
by
the
airline
to
each
passenger
of
the
damage
limitation.
at
that
time
the
warsaw
treaty
provided
for
a
$<ten
thousand>
[=
10,000]
damage
limitation
for
each
passenger.
in
order
to
obtain
the
benefit
of
that
limit,
these
courts
uniformly
held
that
there
must
be
adequate
notice
warning
the
passenger
of
the
limitation
so
that
each
passenger
would
have
choices.
a
passenger
could
choose
to
obtain
protection
by
insurance.
some
passenger
might
choose
not
to
fly.
the
choice
was
to
be
given
to
each
passenger.
in
addition,
these
cases
uniformly
held
that
the
history,
the
drafting
history
of
the
treaty
corroborated
the
language
of
the
history
in
dictating
that
result.
and
those
cases
were
lisi
against
alitalia
airlines,
warren
and
mertens
against
flying
tiger
airline,
involving
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
second
circuit,
and--
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
justice--
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
--i
believe
that
article
3,
the
first
paragraph,
must
be
read
together
with
article
3,
the
second
paragraph,
to
which
you
have
just
referred.
the
combination
of
those
two
operative
sentences
together
dictate
that
for
there
to
be
a
"ticket"
delivered,
that
document
is
only
a
ticket
when
it
contains
the
required
particulars
because--
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
--well,
my
position
would
be
and
is
that
that
is
precisely
what
the
drafters
intended,
mainly,
if
the
date
was
omitted
or
one
of
the
itinerary
stopping
places,
destination...
i
should
say
ultimate
destination
or
originating
place...
if
any
of
those
required
particulars
specified
by
the
first
paragraph
of
article
3
were
omitted,
that
is
what
the
drafters
intended.
they
considered...
i
might
not,
the
court
might
not
consider
the
date
to
be
very
substantive,
but
in
terms
of--
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
--the
drafting
history,
we
submit,
makes
it
clear
that
these
particulars,
each
one
of
them,
and
especially
the
one
that's
involved
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
statement
warning
of
the
damage
limitation,
they
were
characterized
by
the
drafters
as
mandatory
and
invoking
the
sanction
as
they
put
it
of
losing
the
damage
limitation.
and
if
i
might
respectfully
refer
the
court
to
our
brief,
appendix
a-86--
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
--a-86.
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
in
our
brief.
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
yes.
the
blue
covered
brief,
a-86.
there
is
a
passage
on
that
page.
it
is
part
of
the
report
of
mr.
henry
de
vos,
the
"reporter"...
the
reporter
was
the
person
in
charge
of
the
drafting
committee,
its
work.
and
on
page
a-86
under
section
1,
passenger
ticket,
the
third
paragraph
makes
it
clear,
i
believe,
that
the
sanction
and
throughout
the
history
the
sanction
is
the
loss
of
the
damage
limitation,
was
linked
to
the
delivery
of
the
ticket
without
a
statement
or
the
nondelivery
of
a
ticket
to
the
forfeiture
of
the
damage
limitation,
as
they
put
it.
and
that
same
principle
applied
whether
we
dealt
with
a
passenger
ticket,
a
baggage
check
or
cargo
involving
an
air
waybill.
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
yes.
and
the
reason
for
that,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
when
it
came
to
baggage
checks
and
air
waybills
for
cargo,
the
drafters,
unlike
the
passenger
ticket,
considered
some
of
those
provisions
to
be
compulsory,
mandatory,
invoking
the
sanction,
whereas
other
provisions,
the
mere
form
that
would
be
nonsubstantive,
were
not
considered
to
be
compulsory
and,
consequently,
the
language
used
in
drafting
the
terms,
article
4
and
8
and
9
for
the
cargo
and
baggage,
made
the
distinction
between
the
important
document
requirements
and
the
unimportant
ones.
and
there
the
statement
that's
the
subject
of
this
appeal
is
commonly
considered
to
be
a
very
important
one.
it's
the
only
one
that
is
common
to
all
of
the
documents.
each
of
the
three
documents
have
individual
items
that
are
peculiar
to
the
passenger
or
the
baggage
or
the
cargo,
but
the
one
common
ingredient
for
all
of
the
documents,
including
the
passenger
ticket,
is
the
warning
statement.
and
throughout
the
history,
a
large
part
of
the
debate
focused
about
these
noncompulsory
items.
there
never
was
any
argument
or
debate
controverting
the
significance
of
the
statement.
the
statement
was
always
considered
to
be
the
essential
ingredient
for
the
airline
to
gain
the
benefit
of
the
limitation--
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
--yes,
there
is
a
statement.
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
well,
we
could
debate.
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
we
could
debate--
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
--we
concede
that
a
statement
was
delivered.
we
say
and
urge
the
position,
because
we
think
it's
sound,
that
to
a
passenger...
as
distinguished
from
attorneys
who
may
be
knowledgeable
in
the
area...
to
a
passenger
the
statement
must
be
a
reasonable
one.
now,
when...
before
the
montreal
agreement
was
signed--
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
--no,
justice
scalia.
what
we
say
is
that
the
statement
has
to
be
considered
in
relationship
to
the
person
who
the
warning
is
being
given
to.
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
no.
what
i...
we
say
is
that
the
statement
to
a
layperson,
a
passenger,
must
be
a
reasonable
statement
if--
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
--the
reasonableness
is...
depends
upon
the
type
size
in
this
case
because
in
1969
korean
air
lines
said,
"we
will
comply
with
the
regulation.
"
"we
will
give
a
reasonable
notice
considered
to
be
at
least
10
point
type
in
size.
"
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
well,
we
think
that
the
united
states
government
articulated
the...
the
line.
it
set
a
standard,
a
minimum
standard.
this
was
not
a
maximum
standard.
this
was
a
minimum
standard.
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
well,
because
we
believe
the
lisi
cases
and
those
that
follow
it
use
the
term
"adequate
notice",
which
means
reasonable
notice.
i
think
they're
interchangeable.
when
the
united
states
government
determined
that
airlines
were
giving
lilliputian
print
or
small
sized
print
and
this
was
not
warning
passengers
of
the
damage
limitation,
the
united
states
government
promulgated
a
regulation
which
set
the
standard
at
a
minimum
of
10
point
type
and
then
korean
air
lines,
among
all
the
other
international
airlines,
they
signed
an
agreement
in
which
they
accepted
their
obligation
and
affirmatively
asserted
their
obligation
to
give
the
passenger
warning
of
the
limitation,
then
$75,000,
in
a
minimum
of
10
point
type.
now,
the
line
that
was
drawn,
we
could
question
whether
it
was
a
reasonable
and
an
adequate
line.
from
the
passenger's
point
of
view,
larger
than
10
point
type
was--
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
absolutely
because
the
consequence
of
that
would
be--
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
--inadequate
is
acceptable,
and
that's
certainly
the
language
used
by
the
lisi
case.
it
used
adequate
notice
as
the
concept.
and
we
think
that
when
you
fail
to
give
adequate
notice
as
you
have
obligated
yourself
to
do
by
giving
less
than
the
minimum
notice,
then,
the
consequence
is
you
lose
the
damage
limitation,
airline,
because
you
failed
to
follow
what
you
obligated
yourself
to
do.
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
both
the
treaty
as
supplemented
by
the
contractual
obligation
as
supplemented
by
the
regulation.
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
yes.
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
because
the
treaty
itself
contemplates
promulgation
or
agreements
called
special
contracts.
it
authorizes
airlines
to
enter
into
special
contracts
for
the
benefit
of
passengers.
article
22
so
provides.
and
consequently
when
korean
air
lines
signed
this
contract,
it
was
a
special
contract
authorized
by
the
treaty,
article
22,
and
the
beneficiary,
the
only
beneficiary,
of
that
contract,
authorized
by
the
treaty,
was
each
passenger
who
was
delivered
a
ticket.
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
and
that--
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
--minimum.
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
irregularity,
justice
scalia,
is
modified
by
the
following
words,
reading
it
together:
"the
irregularity
of
the
ticket
shall
not
affect
the
existence
or
validity
of
the
contract.
"
this
case
does
not
involve
a
challenge
to
the
existence
or
validity
of
the
contract.
just
the
opposite.
we
affirmatively
assert
the
existence
and
validity
of
the
contract,
the
montreal
agreement,
and
the
ticket.
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
yes.
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
and
one
of
the
rules
was
if
you
don't
give
the
statement...
if
you
don't
give
the
statement,
you
don't
get
the
benefit
of
the
damage
limitation.
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
well--
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
--we
believe
that--
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
it's
very--
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
--well--
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
--with
respect,
justice
scalia,
we
believe
that
the
rule
of
the
convention
is
that
if
you
do
not
give
a
statement...
if
you
do
not
give
a
statement,
you
are
not
entitled
to
the
damage
limitation.
that's
the
provision
of
the
treaty
that's
operative.
korean
airlines
then
said
we're
going
to
give
a
statement
in
ten
point
type,
a
minimum
of
ten
point
type.
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
the
drafters
did
not
consider
that
to
be--
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
--an
irregularity.
the
drafters
said
that
when
we
put
each
of
these
five
items
as
required
by
the
ticket,
we
consider
those
five
items
to
be
substantive,
mandatory,
compulsory...
those
were
the
terms
used...
which
invoke
the
sanction.
and
the
reason
that
they
articulated
and
someone
else
might
not
subscribe
to
the
reasonableness
of
that
position
of
the
drafters,
but
nonetheless
it
is
there,
they
claim
that
each
of
these
particulars
was
necessary
to
invoke
the
jurisdictional
requirements
which
turn
on
the
ticket
itinerary,
the
jurisdictional
requirements
which
turn
on
the
place
of
issue,
which
turn
on
the
carrier,
all
of
those
five
items
the
drafters
said
were
compulsory
because
they
went
to
the
jurisdiction
of
invoking
the
treaty
in
a
particular
litigation.
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
and
they
were
not
considered
to
be
within
the
realm
of
irregularity.
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
they
were
sacrosanct
in
the
view
of
the
drafters.
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
well,
i
think
you...
if
you
read
it
in
the
context
of
loss
or
irregularity,
obviously
in
an
airplane
crash,
the
ticket
carried
by
the
passenger
might
be
destroyed.
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
a
ticket
in
the...
retrieved
from
the
crash
which
was
partially
destroyed
but
not
entirely
or
in
printing...
in
filling
out...
in
filling
out
the
ticket,
if
they
misspelled
the
client's,
the
passenger's
name,
that
would
be
an
irregularity.
in
other
words,
irregularity
was
devoted
to
nonsignificant...
as
the
drafters
view
what
was
significant.
they
said
if
you
lose
the
ticket
but
it
still
was
delivered,
the
contract
still
exists,
and
the
damage
limitation
rules
apply.
if
you
put
in
the
wrong
passenger's
name
or
misspell
it
or
perhaps
they
conceived
although
it's
not
discussed,
if
you
put
in
the
wrong
date.
but
they
made
it
clear
that
the...
the
drafters
made
it
clear...
and
i'm
not
responsible
for
accepting
or
rejecting
their
view...
but
they
made
it
clear
that
each
one
of
these
five
elements,
particularly
the
statement--
mr.
milton
g.
sincoff
--thank
you,
your
honor.
