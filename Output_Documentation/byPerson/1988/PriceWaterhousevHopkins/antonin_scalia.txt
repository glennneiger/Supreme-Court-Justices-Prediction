you
interpret
an
undefined
role
to
mean
some
role?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
don't
deny
that
showing
a
tainted
process
is
certainly
relevant
to
the
disparate
treatment
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
just
saying
it's
not
enough
to
get
you
over
the
hill.
justice

suppose
an,
suppose
an
employee
gets
his,
gets
reinstated
on
the
basis
of
such
a
suit,
having
established
that
the
dismissal
was
for
a
mixed
motive,
i
assume
that
having
won
that
wonderful
victory
the
employee
could
thereupon
immediately
be
re-fired
for
the
valid
reasons
that,
that
were
themselves
self-sufficient.
wouldn't
that
follow?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
yes,
but...
but
in
theory
there
is,
it's
a
hollow
victory,
to
get
reinstated
and
say
you,
the
effective
factor
was
not
necessarily
unlawful.
take
me
back
and
fire
me
for
the
other
effective
factors,
leaving
out
the
unlawful
one.
