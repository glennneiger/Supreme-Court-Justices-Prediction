ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
challenge
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
to
price
waterhouse's
decision
not
to
make
respondent
a
partner
in
the
firm.
the
district
court
in
this
case,
after
a
five-day
trial,
found
that
price
waterhouse
had
legitimate
non-discriminatory
reasons
for
that
decision.
the
district
court
also
found
that
respondent
failed
to
prove
that
those
reasons
were
a
pretext
for
discrimination.
under
this
court's
title
vii
decisions,
including
the
ones
that
have
been
discussed
in
the
last
hour,
those
findings
should
have
resulted
in
a
judgment
for
price
waterhouse.
but
then
something
inexplicable
happened
in
the
district
court's
reasoning.
after
making
the
findings
that
should
have
ended
the
case
in
favor
of
price
waterhouse,
the
district
court
went
on
to
hold
that
three
factors,
each
of
which
was
innocent
by
itself,
somehow
combined
to
produce
a
title
vii
violation
in
this
case.
none
of
those
factors
was
found
to
be
evidence
of
intentional
discrimination,
or
evidence
that
discrimination
had
in
fact
caused
respondent
any
injury.
but
the
district
court
nevertheless
concluded
that
price
waterhouse
violated
title
vii
because
the
firm
failed
to
take
affirmative
steps
to
purge
or
purify
its
decision-making
process
of
an
unquantifiable,
unconscious,
and
unintentional
element
of
sex
stereotyping.
this
finding
of
a
tainted
process
at
price
waterhouse
led
the
district
court
to
characterize
the
case
as
one
involving
mixed
motives
for
the
employment
decision.
on
that
basis
of
the
mixed
motive
characterization,
the
court
then
held
that
it
became
price
waterhouse's
burden
to
prove,
and
to
prove
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
that
its
decision
would
have
been
the
same
even
if
the
process
hadn't
been
tainted.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
justice
white,
that's
the
part
of
the
opinion
that
i
frankly
find
inexplicable,
and
somewhat
i
like
an
o'henry
novel,
because
he
first
found
all
the
factors
that
should
have
resulted
in
price
waterhouse's
winning
this
case.
he
then
found
that
he
was
unable
to
conclude
what
role
the
supposedly
illegitimate
motive
played
in
the
decision.
he
didn't
say
it
played
a
significant
role.
he
didn't
say
it
played
a
substantial
role.
he
said
it
played
an
undefined
role.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
i'll
tell
you
now
that
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
it.
but
i'll
come
back
to
that.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
yes.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
yes,
i
interpret
it
to
mean
some
role.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
and
i
also
interpret,
as
i'll
be
arguing
to
the
court,
that
some
role
is
not
enough
to
satisfy
the
plaintiff's
burden
in
this
case,
that
at
a
minimum
it
has
to
be
a
significant
or
a
substantial
role,
and
that
the
district
court
was
unable
to
make
those
findings
on
the
record
in
this
case.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
choosing
between
those
labels,
we
argue
for
a
"but
for"
standard.
but
i
actually
think
that
all
of
the
labels
of
causation
floating
around
in
this
case,
including
those
supplied
by
the
solicitor
general,
just
add
an
element
of
confusion
to
what
to
me
is
a
relatively
straightforward
question.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
then
the
situation
we
have,
justice
o'connor,
is
basically
who
wins
in
the
case
of
a
tie?
who
wins
if
the
district
court,
as
was
the
case
here,
is
unable
to
decide
which
motive
actually
caused
the
decision?
and
our
position
on
that
issue
is
that
the
answer
has
to
be
for
the
defendant.
the
plaintiff
brought
this
case,
and
if
the
plaintiff
can't
prove
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
and
we
don't
suggest
that
she
be
held
to
any
higher
standard
than
preponderance,
even
though
she
would
hold
us
to
a
clear
and
convincing
standard,
if
she
can't
show
by
a
preponderance
that
the
discriminatory
motive
actually
caused
the
result
she's
complaining
about,
then
there's
no
sound
reason
either
in
policy
or
in
this
court's
prior
precedence
for
holding
that
the
employer
has
violated
the
law.
because
you
have
on
the
other
side
of
the
ledger
an
overwhelming
proof,
accepted
by
the
district
court
here,
that
the
employer
acted
for
legitimate
reasons.
and
you
have
throughout
both
the
language
and
the
legislative
history
of
title
vii,
you
have
starting
with
the
language,
you
have
congress
saying,
it
is
only
unlawful
for
an
employer
to
act
because
of
a
prohibited
reason.
you
have
the
legislative
history
which
shows
that
the
opponents
of
the
bill
were
extremely
concerned
that
the
statute
was
going
to
cut
much
too
deeply
into
employers'
traditional
freedom
to
make
employment
decisions
for
any
reason
they
wanted
to,
as
long
as
it
wasn't
a
prohibited
reason.
the
effect
of
the
court
of
appeals'
mixed
motive
analysis,
which
basically
awards
the
tie
to
the
plaintiff
in
a
case
where
you
can't
decide
what
the
cause
was.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
if
we
need
a
label,
that
is
the
answer
i
would
give.
but
i
submit
that
for
district
courts
and
litigants
to
actually
trying
this
case,
or
this
type
of
case,
the
much
simpler
formulation
is
to
say
to
those
parties
and
to
the
court,
the
question
you're
looking
at
is
did
the
prohibitive
motive
make
a
difference?
that's
the
same
as
"but
for"
causation.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
that--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--that
is
certainly
what
the--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--i
think
that's
what
the
solicitor
general
is
suggesting.
it's
certainly
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
in
this
case.
we
find
that
there
are
numerous
problems
with
that
approach.
the
first
one
is
before
we
even
get
to
who
has
the
burden,
we
have
a
substantive
question
of
what
is
the
standard
of
liability
under
title
vii.
is
it
"but
for"
causation?
it
is
causation
that
made
a
difference
to
the
outcome?
if
that's
the
case,
then
this
court's
title
vii
decisions
hold,
then
it
always
remains
the
plaintiff's
burden.
it
never
shifts
on
the
plaintiff's
burden
to
show
that
she
was
the
victim
of
intentional
discrimination.
if
she
can't
establish
causation,
in
other
words
if
she
can't
establish
that
the
action
she's
challenging
has
caused
by
the
prohibitive
motive,
then
there's
no
sound
reason
compatible
with
title
vii's
purposes
to
give
the
judgment
to
her.
so
that
what
you're
doing,
one
of
the
phrases,
besides
the
many
different
causation
labels
floating
around
in
this
case,
one
of
the
phrases
that
also
permeates
the
case
is
the
notion
that
the
employer
in
this
situation
is
a
"proven
wrongdoer".
and
i
think
that's
in
part
the
question
you're
asking.
but
i
would
point
out
that
the
employer
in
this
case
is
simultaneously
a
proven
right
doer,
if
you
will.
in
other
words,
the
court
has
found
that
the
employer
has
acted
at
least
as
much
for
a
legitimate
motive,
which
congress
clearly
didn't
intend
to
punish,
as
it
has
for
an
illegitimate
motive.
and
again,
i
come
back
to
it
being
the
plaintiff's
burden
to
bring
the
ball
over
the
50-yard
line.
if
she
can't,
show
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
the
prohibitive
motive
caused
the
injury
she's
suing
to
redress,
then
it's
quite
unclear
why
you
are
awarding
her
a
judgment--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--there
this,
that
language
appears,
and
in
this
court's
cases
i
think
it
doesn't
translate
to
the
title
vii
setting.
in
this
court's
cases
it
appears
in
two
cases,
the
transportation
management
case
and
the
mt.
healthy
case.
neither
of
those
cases
dealt
with
either
title
vii-specific
language
or
with
the
legislative
history
of
title
vii,
which
shows
extensive
congressional
debate
about,
on
the
one
hand
preserve,
making
sure
that
employers
were
not
allowed
to
act
for
prohibited
reasons
but
at
the
same
time
ensuring
employers
complete
freedom
to
make
employment
decisions
based
on
any
other
reason
than
a
prohibited
reason.
and
what
the
court
of
appeals
analysis
does
here
by
resorting
to
significant
factor
or
motivating
factor,
as
opposed
to
"but
for"
causation,
is
allow
a
plaintiff
to
establish
liability
even
though
the
record
also
establishes
that
the
employer
acted
for
a
perfectly
legitimate
reason.
the
second
problem
besides
the
distinction
between
title
vii
and
the
other
two
cases
of
this
court,
which
didn't
address
title
vii's
history
and
language,
is
that
transportation
management,
for
example,
was
in
my
view
purely
an
agency
deference
case.
the
court
upheld
the
significant
factor
and
then
burden-shifting
approach
in
that
case,
because
the
board,
the
national
labor
relations
board,
presented
that
to
the
court
as
its
interpretation
of
its
own
statute.
the
court
simultaneously
said
that
it
would
have
been
perfectly
acceptable,
and
perfectly
plausible
and
reasonable
and
something
the
court
would
have
upheld,
had
the
court,
had
the
board
taken
the
position
under
the
nlra
that
we
take
here
under
title
vii.
essentially,
the
court
said
it
was
a
matter
for
the
board's
discretion,
and
it
was
unwilling
to
overturn
the
policy
judgment
that
the
board
had
made
in
that
case.
but
none
of
that
bears
on
how
title
vii
should
be
interpreted.
and
then
a
final
factor
that
makes
this
case
quite
different
from
transportation
management
and
mt.
healthy
is
that
in
those
cases,
as
you've
noted,
at
least
the
triggering
predicate
for
shifting
the
burden
was
a
finding
that
the
prohibited
motive
was
either
a
substantial
or
a
significant
or
a
motivating
factor
in
the
decision.
here
we
don't
even
have
that.
here
we
have
the
district
court
saying
that
at
most
this
was
an
undefined...
the
prohibited
motive
played
an
undefined
role,
an
unquantifiable
role.
we
don't
have
a
finding
that
it
was
a
significant
factor.
we
have
the
court
of
appeals
saying
that
it
was
a
significant
factor,
but
the
court
of
appeals
wasn't
the
one
hearing
the
evidence
and
making
the
findings.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
one
can,
as
i
have
read
the
district
court's
opinion--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--the
court
of
appeals
took,
made
findings,
which
is
in
its
role,
that
the
district
court
never
made.
the
district
court--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--you
obviously
are
reviewing
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment.
but
to
the
extent
that
the
the
court--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--we're
not
asking--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--contributed
to,
that's,
justice
white,
that
is
a
significant
and
crucial
difference
between
contributed
to
and
caused
the
decision.
and
although
this
starts
off--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--part
of
the
cause
is
not
enough,
if
the
decision
would
have
been
the
same
in
any
event.
part
of
the
cause
is
some
factor,
some
role--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--that's
correct.
it's
not
enough
under
the
court's
own
prior
cases
that
have
addressed
similar
issues
under
different
statutes.
or
under
the
constitution.
part
of
the
cause
skips
the
causal
link
that
we
contend
is
essential
between
the
action
the
plaintiff
is
challenging
and
what
actually
happened
to
her
in
this
case.
i'd
like
to
back
up
for
a
moment,
because
although
these
burden
of
proof
and
burden-shifting
issues
are
quite
significant,
there
is
in
this
case
a
fundamental
threshold
question
of
whether
this
even
is
a
mixed
motive
case
in
the
first
place.
and
before
the
court
wrestles
with
the
difficult
burden-shifting
issues,
it's
quite
important
that
it
understand
the
consequences
as
applied
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
attaching
the
mixed
motive
label
to
any
particular
case.
in
this
case,
we
have
overwhelming
evidence,
accepted
by
the
district
court,
not
overturned
by
the
court
of
appeals,
of
a
legitimate
motive
in
price
waterhouse's
favor.
the
evidence
showed,
the
district
court
found,
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
disagree,
that
from
the
very
beginning
of
respondent's
tenure
at
price
waterhouse
there
were
significant
problems
in
her
ability
to
get
along
with
staff
and
peers.
the
evidence
further
shows
that
she
was
warned
about
those
problems,
that
she
was
told
she
needed
to
correct
them,
that
she
agreed
she
needed
to
correct
them.
but
at
the
time
of
the
partnership
decision
in
this
case
she
had
not
in
fact
taken
any
action
to
correct
them
at
all.
so
the
issue
in
this
case
really
wasn't,
should
ann
hopkins
be
made
a
partner,
but
should
ann
hopkins
either
be
rejected
outright
or
placed
on
hold
for
future
consideration?
we
basically
don't
have
in
this
case
enough
evidence
of
the
type
that
the
court
had
in
transportation
management
or
in
mt.
healthy
to
characterize
this
as
a
mixed
motive
case.
all
that
we
have
on
respondent's
side
of
the
ledger,
on
the
illegitimate
motive
side
of
the
ledger,
is
a
few
isolated
comments,
virtually
all
of
them
sex
neutral,
virtually
all
of
them
from
her
supporters,
that
psychologist
characterized
as
the
product
of
stereotype
thinking.
we
don't
in
this
case
deny
that
there
were
a
few
sex-based
comments
about
respondent,
and
that
those
comments
were
probably
inappropriate.
but
they
simply
don't
shed
any
light
on
the
existence
of
a
mixed
motive
in
this
case.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
no,
your
honor.
they
clearly
would
be
relevant
evidence.
but
they
don't
in
this
case
amount
to
supplying
what's
crucial,
which
is
the
causal
link
between
the
comments
and
the
action
that
happened,
that
the
firm
took
in
the
case
of
ann
hopkins.
the
comments
come
from
the
supporters,
the
comments
that
are
criticized
as
stereotypes
come
from
her
supporters.
they
come
from
men
who
wanted
her
to
become
a
partner
in
this
firm.
there's
no
linkage
between
those
comments.
first
of
all,
it
takes
a
great
leap
of
imagination
to
say
that
stereotype
comments,
even
if
inappropriate,
from
people
who
wanted
her
to
become
a
partner,
somehow
hurt
her.
and
the
court
of
appeals
was
unable
to
make
that
conclusion.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
we
can't
tell
that
those
comments
hurt
her.
the
court
of
appeals
instead
took
those
comments
of
evidence,
as
evidence
of
discrimination
in
the
process.
that
we
submit
is
discrimination
in
the
air.
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
discrimination
didn't
touch
the
plaintiff
when
you
talk
about
discrimination
in
the
air,
it
may
well
have
touched
the
plaintiff.
but
there's
no
causal
connection
between
the
comments
and
hopkins'
fate
at
price
waterhouse.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
pardon?
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
price
waterhouse
put
on
evidence
that
its
policy
was
non-discriminatory.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
the
record
is
quite
clear,
justice
marshall,
that
the
statements
that
are
being
criticized
here
were
not
the
statements
of
the
ultimate
decision
makers.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
the
record
shows
an
elaborate
process,
so
i
can't
give
you
one
page.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
you
mean
that
they
weren't
made?
we
agree
they
were
made.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
i'm
not...
you
need
to
help
by
telling
me
which
statements
you're
referring
to.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
i'm
not
aware
of...
there
probably
isn't.
but
that's
not
the
point
here.
the
point
is
that
that
statement--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--i
understand
it's
your
point.
but
my
point
is
that
that
statement
was
made
by
someone
who
wanted
her
to
become
a
partner.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
and
the
statement,
i
would
like
to
focus,
justice
marshall,
for
a
minute
on
the
negative
comments,
on
the
comments
from
opponents
of
ann
hopkins,
which
are
the
ones
that
were
characterized
by
the
expert
in
this
case
as
being
the
product
of
stereotype
thinking.
those
comments,
which
reflect--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--it's
clear,
your
honor,
we've
covered
that
thoroughly
in
our
brief,
that
that
comment
was
made
by
her
strongest
supporter
in
the
firm,
after
the
fact,
after
the
decision
was
made
in
this
case,
that
however
ill-advised
it
may
have
been,
and
i
personally
regard
it
as
an
inappropriate
comment,
but
however
ill-advised
it
may
have
been
it
was
his
personal
reaction
to
her
situation.
and
there
is
no
linkage
between
that
comment
and
the
ultimate
decision
made
about
her.
he
was
not
the
ultimate
decision
maker.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
pardon?
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
no,
it
came
after
the
decision
had
been
made.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
i
think
a
matter
of
months.
maybe
somewhat
less
than
that.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
that's
certainly--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--that's
their
characterization
of
what
was
happening.
but
what
they're
confusing,
i
think,
is
the
type
of
case
she
brought
with
an
entirely
different
case
that
she
didn't
bring,
she
didn't
try,
that
the
district
court
never
heard,
and
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
review.
and
isn't
before
this
court
either.
she
brought
a
case
challenging
disparate
treatment
in
her
individual
situation.
the
focus
of
that
kind
of
case
under
this
court's
precedence
is
on
the
particular
employment
decision
about
her.
if
she'd
wanted,
and
this
evidence
is
relevant,
the
evidence
you're
talking
about
is
relevant
to
a
different
type
of
case.
if
she'd
wanted
to
attack
the
decision-making
process
at
price
waterhouse,
there
were
a
number
of
other
ways
she
could
have
proceeded.
the
most
obvious
would
have
been
a
case
under
section
703(a)(2)
of
title
vii.
that
section
focuses
on
employment
practices
that
deprive,
or
tend
to
deprive,
employees
of
opportunities
without
limiting
the
focus
to
a
specific
employment
decision
made
about
the
particular
plaintiff
bringing
the
suit.
if
she'd
brought
that
type
of
case
it
would
have
been--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--i'd
have
to
first
tell
you
that
that
isn't
our
case
at
all.
we
have
no
findings
that
this
was
critical.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
and
we
of
course
don't
agree
that
may
have
affected
is
a
relevant
causation
standard.
but
taking
all
that
away,
then
it's
possible
that
she
has
a
cause
of
action.
but
that's
not
the
case,
and
it's
not
the--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--one
of
the
key
components
of
the
case
she
brought,
which
is
an
individual
plaintiff
disparate
treatment
case,
is
intent.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
she
didn't
prove
intent.
if
she
had
brought
the
case
i
was
describing
under
section
703(a)(2),
where
she
challenged
the
decision-making
process
at
price
waterhouse,
it
would
not
have
been
necessary
for
her
to
show
intentional
discrimination
at
the
liability
stage.
it
would
have
been
sufficient
for
her
to
establish
that
there
was
a
tainted
process
at
work,
and
then
you
would
have
a
separate
inquiry
into
whether
she
in
particular
or
if
she
brought
a
class
action
any
other
members
of
class,
were
entitled
to
relief,
because
they
themselves
had
been
harmed
by
the
process.
but
she
didn't
bring
a
process
case--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--it's
relevant,
but
it's--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--that's
correct.
it's
like,
it's
very
much
like
the
court's
case
at
the
end
of
last
term
in
watson,
where
there
was
evidence
of
substantial
racial
stereotyping,
which
the
court
said
may
not
have
been
enough
to
prove
a
disparate,
an
intentional
disparate
treatment
case,
but
may
in
fact
have
been
quite
relevant
to
proving
a
case
under
section
703(a)(2)
of
disparate
impact
attacking
the
fairness
of
the
employer's
subjective
decision-making
process.
plaintiff,
or
respondent,
could
have
brought
that
type
of
case
here,
and
she,
and
the
evidence
we're
talking
about
would
have
been
relevant
in
that
type
of
case.
we're
not
focusing
here
on
simply
a
technical
pleading
defect,
saying
she
pled
the
wrong
subsection
of
the
statute.
the
problem
is
much
bigger
than
that,
because
no
one
knew
until
her
brief
in
this
court,
which
is
the
first
time
that
section
703(a)(2)
has
ever
been
mentioned
in
this
litigation,
that
we
were
litigating
a
process
case
that
not
only
focused
on
the
employment
decision
about
her
but
purported
to
be
an
indictment
of
price
waterhouse's
entire
decision-making
process.
if
that
type
of
case
is
to
be
brought,
then
obviously
you
need
something
that
didn't
happen
in
the
district
court.
you
need
a
focused
and
fair
and
full
inquiry
into
the
fairness
of
price
waterhouse's
entire
decision-making
process.
if
she
succeeds
in
proving,
she
or
someone
else
succeeds
in
proving
a
tainted
decision-making
process,
it
may
well
be
that
at
that
point
specific
relief,
such
as
an
injunction
or
a
declaratory
judgment,
might
be
appropriate.
but
here
we're
talking
about
a
plaintiff
who
is
unable,
who
brings
an
individual
disparate
treatment
case,
who
is
unable
to
establish
that
the
conduct
she
challenges
actually
caused
the
results
she's
complaining
about,
and
yet
she
nevertheless
claims
that
she's
entitled
at
least
to
a
liability
judgment,
and
to
some
sort
of
partial
relief,
such
as
an
injunction,
declaratory
judgment,
and
attorneys'
fees,
even
though
she
can't
make
the
necessary
causal
link.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
the
district
court,
in
fact,
didn't
find
that.
the
district
court
rejected--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--the
court
of
appeals
says
that
repeatedly,
your
honor.
but
if
you're
looking
at
the
findings,
they
come
only
from
the
district
court.
the
district
court,
he
expressly
rejects--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--well,
the
court
of
appeals
was
drawing
its
own
legal
conclusions
on
the
same
facts
that
the
district
court
said,
don't
support
the
claim
you
just
read.
the
district
court
specifically
rejected
the
notion
that
she
had
established
a
claim
showing
she
was
treated
differently
than
comparably
situated
men.
the
district
court
specifically
rejected
a
claim
that,
based
on
her
introduction
of
statistical
evidence
to
show
that
she
was
treated
differently,
that
women
in
general
were
treated
differently
than
men
at
price
waterhouse.
so
that,
to
take
findings
which
clearly
are
the
province
of
the
district
court
and
have
the
court
of
appeals
elevate
them
into
something
that
the
district
court
never
found
doesn't--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--i
suggest
that
when
you're
looking--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--when
you're
looking
for
findings,
you
will
find
them
in
the
district
court's
opinion.
and
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
characterize
them
as
something
other
than
the
district
court
found
does
not
turn
them
into
findings.
the
final
issue
in
this
case,
which
i'll
just
devote
a
minute
to
and
then
save
the
minute
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
is
simply
the
court
of
appeals'
error
in
switching
the
burden
of
persuasion,
if
it's
to
be
switched
at
all,
to
price
waterhouse
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
respondent
makes
only
a
half-hearted
attempt
to
defend
that
portion
of
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment,
and
with
good
reason.
that
standard
is
rarely
invoked.
it's
certainly,
to
our
knowledge,
never
been
invoked
to
require
a
defendant
to
disprove
a
plaintiff's
case.
and
the
court
of
appeals
here
offered
no
explanation
for
departing
from
the
normal
preponderant
standard.
and
certainly
that
aspect
of
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment
requires
reversal.
i'll
save
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
there
are
just
two
points
i'd
like
to
address,
your
honor.
the
first
is
plaintiff's
contention
that
our
position
puts
an
impossible
burden
of
proof
on
the
plaintiff
in
a
title
vii
action.
that's
simply
not
the
case.
this
court
in
burdine
recognized
that
the
plaintiff
has
full
access
to
the
eeoc's
investigatory
files,
as
well
as
to
discovery
in
a
civil
case.
and
this
case
well
bears
that
out,
because
by
the
time
this
case
went
to
trial,
plaintiff
knew
as
much
about
price
waterhouse's
decision-making
process
as
price
waterhouse
itself
knobs.
she
was
not
laboring
under
any
handicap.
and
to
make
her
prove
her
case
is
simply
not
unfair.
the
second
point
i'd
like
to
address
is
plaintiff's
theory
that
the
way
to
deal
with
this
class
of
cases
is
to
draw
a
distinction
between
liability
and
remedy.
that
distinction
does
not
work
and
does
not
make
sense
in
the
type
of
case
plaintiff
brought,
of
an
individual
disparate
treatment
claim.
if
she
succeeds
in
proving
causation
in
that
type
of
claim,
then
she's
entitled
to
full
relief.
you
may
need
to
measure,
you
may
need
to
have
quantification
on
the
amount
of
back
pay.
you
may
need
to
work
out
the
specifics
of
the
relief.
but
there's
no
doubt
that
she
gets
full
relief.
on
the
other
hand,
it
she
cant,
establish
causation,
there
is
no
justification,
and
in
fact
there
are
serious
article
iii
problems
with
giving
her
partial
relief,
article
iii
problems
giving
her
an
injunction
when
she's
no
longer
there
to
enforce
it,
when
she
hasn't
brought
a
class
action,
and
there
are
no
other
women
who
can
show
that
they're
affected
by
price
waterhouse's
future
conduct.
and
you
certainly
would
not
give
her
attorneys'
fees
for
establishing
a
process
violation
when
she
can't
show
that
that
process
harmed
her.
so
that
the
liability/remedy
dichotomy
that
the
plaintiff
is
urging
the
court
to
adopt
makes
sense
in
a
different
type
of
title
vii
case.
it
makes
sense
in
disparate
impact
cases,
it
makes
sense
in
class
action
cases,
it
makes
sense
in
pattern
or
practice
cases,
where
the
liability
showing
does
not
require
the
establishment
of
"but
for"
causation,
and
you
leave
to
a
separate
remedy
stage
whether
particular
individuals
have
been
harmed
and
should
be
the
beneficiaries
of
specific
relief,
such
as
reinstatement
or
back
pay.
but
in
her
type
of
case,
those
inquiries
merge
into
the
liability
determination,
and
if
she
can't
get
over
the
liability
hurdle,
you
simply
don't
reach
the
remedial
phase
of
the
case.
thank
you.
