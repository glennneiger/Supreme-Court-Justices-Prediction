justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
you
put
it,
the
district
court
must
have...
if
there
was
a
mixed
motive,
didn't
it
necessarily
find
that
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
refusal
was,
was
gender
based?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then,
i'd
better
wait
until
you
tell
me
what
the
court
of
appeals
did.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
tell
us
you
don't
like
labels,
but
it
seems
to
me
we
have
to
use
labels
at
times
in
order
to
describe
to
district
and
trial
courts
what
they
should
do,
and
that
the
answer
you
have
just
given
to
justice
o'connor
is
that
the
plaintiff
must
show
"but
for"
causation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
interpreted
the
district
court's
opinion
and
findings.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
isn't
that
what
the
court
did,
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
should
we,
should
we
judge
this
case
on
the
basis
of,
are
we
reviewing
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
district
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and,
i
take
it
that
part
of
what
it
based
its
judgment
on
was
its
understanding
of
the
facts
as
found
by
the
district
court
that
there
was--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
there
was
a
mixed
motive,
and
that
there
was
an
unacceptable,
something
unacceptable
caused
the...
contributed
to
this
refusal.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
if
i
put
it
part
of
the
cause
for
the
decision?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
i
take
it
you
agree
that
we
should
review
the
case
on
the
basis
that
the
court
of
appeals
at
least
found
that
part
of
the
cause
was,
and
then
you
say,
well,
that
isn't
enough.
is
that
what
we--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
do
we
do
with
the
court
of
appeals'
statement
that
hopkins
demonstrated
and
the
district
court
found
that
she
was
treated
less
favorably
than
male
candidates
because
of
her
sex?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
know.
but
this
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
says,
and
that's
the
court
of
appeals'
interpretation
of
the
district
court's
findings.
and
that's,
that's
just
one
of
several
places
where
the
court
of
appeals
says
this.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
know,
but
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
had
to
have
found...
was
looking
at
the
judgment
below,
the
facts
from
the
standpoint
of
whether
they
were
clearly
erroneous.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--what
the
district
court
said
or
found,
i
guess
we're
supposed
to
anyway.
aren't
we?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
suppose
that
this
finding
as
historical
fact
sort
of
saying
that
is
subject
to
the
clearly
erroneous
standard
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
although
there
is
some
submissions
in
this
case
that
indicate
that
that
should
be
the
standard.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
mt.
healthy
goes
to
liability,
doesn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
do
you
think
the
two
courts
below
said,
meant
when
they
said
that
the
employer
could
have
shown
that
it
would
have
engaged
in
this
denial
of
the
partnership
anyway,
but
it
didn't
do
it?
what
do
you
think
they
meant?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
right,
right.
well,
what
if,
what
if
the
employer
had
come
back
and
said,
and
proved
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
court,
would
it
have
gone
to
liability?
i
would
have
supposed
it
would.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
no
reinstatement.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
i
wasn't...
i
was
thinking
about
something
else
entirely.
