justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
argue
for
some
"but
for"
standard
of
causation?
or
are
you
willing
to
settle
for
a,
substantial
factor?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what,
what
is
the
liability
situation
in
a
case
when
there
are
two
independently
sufficient
causes
for
a
particular
employer's
action,
either
one
of
which
would
be
sufficient
in
and
of
itself,
and
one
of
which
is
an
illegitimate
reason,
such
as
racial
or
gender
discrimination?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
maybe
the
meaning.
maybe
the
meaning,
though,
and
maybe
what
lower
courts
have
done
in
if
there
are
two
reasons
established,
one
legitimate,
one
illegitimate,
maybe
the
burden
shifts
to
the
employer
at
that
stage
to
do
something.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
maybe
not
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
but
maybe
to
do
something.
maybe
then
the
burden
shifts
to
the
employer.
is
that
what
the--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--solicitor
general
is
suggesting?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there's
language
in
a
number
of
cases
out
there
that
it's
enough
to
show
that
the
discriminatory
reason
was
a
substantial
factor.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
ms.
oberly,
do
you
say
that
the
comments
by
partners
about
women,
past
women
candidates,
and
also
evidence
about
the
way
in
which
the
employer
system
was
structured,
are
irrelevant
to
a
showing
of
discriminatory
motive?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
perhaps
no
attorneys'
fees,
if,
there's
only
injunctive
relief,
says
hewitt
against
helms.
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
aren't
most
cases
mixed
motive
situations,
for
example,
even
in
mcdonnell
douglas
and
burdine,
in
a
sense
they
are
so-called
mixed
motives.
you
have
to
decide,
the
trier
of
fact
has
to
choose
between
a
legitimate
reason
and
an
illicit
reason.
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
didn't
the
trial
court
have
to
make
such
a
finding
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
wouldn't
wouldn't
the
evidence
of
gender
stereotyping
go
to
the
question
of
whether
the
interpersonal
skills
criteria
of
the
employer
was
a
pretext,
in
effect?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
was
pretextual
as
applied
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
he
ever
quantify
that
something?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
pretty
difficult
when
you
combine
that
with
mt.
healthy.
i
mean,
where
are
we
on
liability?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
who
has
what
burden?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
have
any
support
for
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
that
the
court
shifted
ever
to
the
employer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
any
support
from
any
of
our
cases?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
the
plaintiff
ever
make
out
in
the
trial
court
a
disparate
impact
claim
under
703(a)(2)?
