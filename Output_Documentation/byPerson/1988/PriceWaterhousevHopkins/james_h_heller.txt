mr.
james
h.
heller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
guess
i
had
not
expected
to
spend
this
much
time
on
findings
as
i
now
think
it's
expected
i
should
do.
this
court
has
so
often
talked
about
not
engaging
in
second-guessing
of
the
findings,
and
i
don't
think
the
court
of
appeals
did
that,
even
if
it
used
slightly
different
language.
but
the
district
judge
in
this
case
did,
i
think,
a
remarkably
careful
job,
and
i
think
unfortunately
ms.
oberly
has
rather
scanted
what
the
findings
say.
he
found
in
the
final
order,
which
is
on
page
62
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
the
discrimination
caused
in
part
a
denial
of
this
partnership.
it
did
so
because
price
waterhouse
did
not
protect
the
partnership
evaluation
process
from
stereotyped
attitudes.
before
he
got
to
that
he
built
very
carefully
the
reason
why
it
took
three
elements
to
find
that
price
waterhouse
had
done
this
with
what
is
the
equivalent
of
a
corporate
or
a
firm
intent.
mr.
james
h.
heller
i
would
have
thought
it
was
subject
to
the
clearly
erroneous
standard,
and
i
will,
i
see
very
little
mention
of
anderson
v.
city
of
bessemer
city
and
pullman
v.
swint
in
the
briefs
either
of
the
government,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
or
of
price
waterhouse.
yes,
we
have
thought
all
along
that
what,
what
we
are
perhaps
being
assailed
for,
or
what
judge
gesell
is
being
assailed
for,
is
being
careful
in
this
case,
not
overstating
what
he
found,
that
this
is
a
classic
mixed
motives
case.
and
unfortunately
they
don't
subject
themselves
to
the
kind
of
analysis
that
the
bean-counting
approach
of
the
government's
brief
seems
to
suggest,
because
there
is
no
way
that
votes
get
counted
here.
what
happens
is
this
is
a
process
in
which
there
is
in
effect
a
veto
power
in
a
relatively
small
group
of
objectors
among
the
partners
who
comment
on
this,
because
that
is
what
the
policy
committee
takes
note
of.
and
we
had
that
from
the
senior
partner,
joseph
connor,
when
we
took
his
deposition
de
bene
esse.
that
is
the
decisive
factor
here.
using
subjective
standards,
collegial
decision-making,
which
is
as
hard
to
penetrate
as
the
kind
of
legislative
and
administrative
decision
making
that
this
court
talked
about
in
the
arlington
heights
case,
price
waterhouse
relies
very
heavily
and
gives
great
weight
and
leverage
to
the
comments
of
these
partners.
now,
the
evidence
that
was
given
about
what
those
comments
mean
is
quite
full,
and
it's
all
in
the
joint
appendix.
not
all
of
it.
there
are
some
obvious
things.
there
is
that
comment
about
dressing
more
femininely,
walking
more
femininely,
talking
more
femininely.
that's
said
by
one
of
the
two
messengers
in
this
case.
that
is
the
messenger
from
the
policy
board
in
the
partnership,
and
that's
what
judge
gesell
found,
to
ms.
hopkins.
there
is
also
another
messenger
who
comes
from
the
local
office
where
she's
being
nominated
to
the
policy
board,
and
that
was
roger
marcellin.
and
he's
the
man
who
said,
i
have
no
doubt
that
tom
beyer,
the
man
who
made
those
remarks,
knew
exactly
what
to
tell
her,
where
the
problems
lay.
that
was
in
response
to
a
question
by
the
judge,
by
the
way.
but
the
predicate
for
this,
"caused
in
part",
and
do
think
that
that
is
really
stronger
than
played
a
role
or
a
motivating
factor
or
a
substantial
factor,
and
i
see
no
reason
why
any
of
those
tests
wouldn't
work.
one
could
even
use
the
definition
of
material
in
the
kungys
case
as
a
natural
tendency
to
influence
the
decision.
but
whatever,
whatever
formulation
of
that
is
used,
here
there
was
a
finding
that
was
caused
in
part
and
the
predicate
for
that
finding
was
a
series
of
decisions,
of
statements
in
judge
gesell's
decision
itself.
he
said,
although
the
stereotyping
by
individual
partners
may
have
been
unconscious
on
their
part,
the
maintenance
of
a
system
that
gave
weight
to
such
biased
criticisms
was
a
conscious
act
of
the
partnership
as
a
whole.
and
he
said
then
almost
in
the
next
sentence,
and
i'm
reading
at
56
and
57,
the
plaintiff
appears
to
have
been
a
victim
of
emissive
and
subtle
discrimination
created
by
a
system
that
made
evaluations
based
on
outmoded
attitudes,
that
is
stereotyping,
determinative.
determinative.
hard
to
find
a
more
decisive
word.
and
then
finally,
before
he
went
on
to
talk
about
mixed
motives
where
he
said
again,
discrimination
played
a
role
in
the
employment
decision.
before
he
went
on
to
say
that,
he
said,
the
court
finds
that
the
policy
board's
decision
not
to
admit
the
plaintiff
to
partnership
was
tainted
by
discriminatory
evaluations
that
were
the
direct
result
of
its
failure,
the
policy
board's,
to
address
the
evident
problem
of
sexual
stereotyping
in
partnership
evaluations.
now,
this
isn't
a
question
of
the
50-yard
line.
this
is
a
question
of
two
motives
possibly
playing
a
part,
and
what
must
the
plaintiff
show.
that
we
thought
was
the
first
main
issue
in
this
case.
what
we
believe
the
plaintiff
must
show
is
clearly
marked
by
this
court's
decisions.
a
motivating
factor,
a
substantial
factor.
and
transportation
management,
i
believe,
characterized
mt.
healthy
as
saying,
played
a
role.
this
is
if
anything
a
statute
which
is--
mr.
james
h.
heller
--you
might...
that
certainly
is
possible.
you
might
have
the
same
case
again,
but
you
might
have
the
retaliation
problem
as
well.
mr.
james
h.
heller
that's
a
little
bit,
i
think,
justice
scalia,
that's
a
little
bit
like
what
the
findings
and
testimony
were
about
whether
or
not
a
partnership
price,
such
as
price
waterhouse,
really
tries
to
control
this
sort
of
thing.
if
the
courts
give
smart
money
or
equitable
relief
because
it
has
happened,
it
is
not
likely
to
happen
again.
we
have
no
thought
that
price
waterhouse,
like
other
intelligent
firms
in
this
world,
doesn't
learn
by
its
past
mistakes
and
doesn't
learn
that
this
process
as
it
was
conducting
it
at
the
time
of
ms.
hopkins'
candidacy
is
really,
is
really
just
unacceptable.
but,
so
i
don't
think,
i
think
yes,
in
theory
that
can
happen
again.
there
can
be
a
serial
kind
of
mystery
or
murder
story
going
on--
mr.
james
h.
heller
--well,
we
agree
that
that
is,
we
certainly
agree
that
that
is
open
to
them.
we
have
said
that
it
should
be
a
stronger
burden
of
proof--
mr.
james
h.
heller
--there's
no
question.
mr.
james
h.
heller
oh
no.
you
don't
win
just
because
it's
a
mixed
motive
case.
that
gets
you
to--
mr.
james
h.
heller
--well,
we
have
not
taken
that
position.
we
tried
to
distinguish
between
the
liability
stage
and
the
relief
stage.
when
you
get
to
the
relief
stage,
and
706(g)
of
the
act
we
think
is
structured
very
clearly
to
say
that,
the
second
sentence
just
reeks
of
a
defendant's
responsibility
to
come
forward
and
say,
that's
not
the
reason
we
did
it.
we
would
have
done
it
anyway.
the
question
i
think
there
is
whether
it's
to
be
clear--
mr.
james
h.
heller
--no.
we
think,
we
think
in
all
fairness
that
it
doesn't
go
to
liability.
they
showed
liability,
they
showed
that
there
were
two
motives.
judge
gesell
ended
up
saying
there
are
two
possible
explanations
for
this,
each
of
them
may
have
caused
it
in
part.
at
that
point
we
think
that
the
wording,
the
policy,
the
intent
of
title
vii,
the
dealings
of
the
case--
mr.
james
h.
heller
--mt.
healthy--
mr.
james
h.
heller
--that,
that
is
true,
in
mt.
healthy,
that
that
is
what
mt.
healthy
held.
but
we
think
that
it
comes
really
at
the
remedy
stage,
because
title
vii
is
very
explicitly
structured
that
way.
and
that's
where
it
should
come.
that
one
does
not
simply
say
there
are
two
possible
factors,
and
therefore
you
lose.
this
is
not
a
football
game.
something
has
tended
to
deprive
her
of
it.
and
by
the
way,
i
don't
think--
mr.
james
h.
heller
--i
think
they
meant
to
say,
show
us
some
standards
that
you've
written
out,
some
history
that's
clear--
mr.
james
h.
heller
--i
wouldn't
have
supposed
it
would,
no.
it
would
go
because
706(g)
says
that
if
you
prove
discrimination
affected
the
employment
decision,
that
is,
that
is
grounds
for
some
relief.
that
is
the
first
sentence.
when
you
get
to
the
second
sentence,
it
says,
however,
there
shall
be
no
reinstatement
or
back
pay
if
you
show,
if
there
was
another
reason.
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
very
intelligent
structuring
of
the
way
one
deals
with
relief
rather
than
liability.
mr.
james
h.
heller
and
no
reinstatement,
if
you
make
that
showing
by
the
necessary
standard,
which
we've
said
should
be
clear
and
convincing.
mr.
james
h.
heller
excuse
me.
mr.
james
h.
heller
attorneys'
fees
and
a
general
injunction
are
declaratory
judgment.
that
is
correct--
mr.
james
h.
heller
--possibly,
no
attorneys'
fees.
but
we
would
have
though
that
that's
a
matter
of,
of
analyzing
to
what
extent
you've
succeeded
on
claims.
mr.
james
h.
heller
they
are
all
that
way
until
you
get
to
the
third
stage
and
the
trial
judge
says,
i
find
that
this
was
either-or,
and
i
believe
this
or
that.
mr.
james
h.
heller
partly
because
of
the
complexity
of
the
process
that
was
going
on
here,
and
because
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
anything
that,
in
title
vii,
that
says
you
must
say
either-or,
and
this
court's
decisions
seem
to
say
they're--
mr.
james
h.
heller
--well--
mr.
james
h.
heller
--professor
fiske's
testimony
went
partly
to
the
intensity
as
well
as
the
kind
of
comments
that
were
being
said.
yes,
it
goes
to
it,
and
that's
another
reason,
that's
another
reason
why
it
could
be
possibly
come
out
as
a
pretext
case.
but
it
did
not.
judge
gesell
found
there
was
some
grounds
for
that,
but
when
he
looked
at
the
nature
of
the
comments
of
a
very
significant
number
of
the
objectors
to
this
candidacy,
and
the
way
they
were
phrased,
one
the
intensity,
calling
her
potentially
dangerous,
nobody
likes
her,
universally
disliked,
he
then
came
to
a
conclusion,
a
very
careful
conclusion,
that
there
was
something
of
both
here.
mr.
james
h.
heller
no.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
the
government's
approach,
and
i
think
it's
pretty
much
unquantifiable.
price
waterhouse
does
not
run
a
counted
vote
system,
and
people
aren't
required
to
get
up
and
explain
their
votes.
so
we're
back
with
this
problem
that
arlington
heights
addresses.
mr.
james
h.
heller
i
believe
we
are
on
liability--
mr.
james
h.
heller
--i
believe
we
are
on
liability
that
she
had
met
the
burden
of
showing
that
it
caused,
in
part,
or
was
a
significant,
substantial
factor,
a
motivating
factor,
that
there
may
well
have
been
another
factor.
now
the
question
i
think
is
to
say,
how
much
relief,
what
relief,
if
any,
is
she
entitled
to
in
the
circumstances.
mr.
james
h.
heller
what
we
think
the
support
is
is
the
common
law
principles
of
making
the
person
who
has
been
found
to
have
had
at
least
one
wrong
motive
disentangle
from--
mr.
james
h.
heller
--i
don't
think
there
is
from
any
of
your
cases--
mr.
james
h.
heller
--any
of
the
court's
cases
in
a
discrimination
or--
mr.
james
h.
heller
--no.
i
think
judge
gesell's
footnote,
which
you'll
find
at
page
60,
is
quite
right.
that
seems
to,
seemed
to
us
at
the
time,
at
least,
to
call
for
statistical
proof,
and
i'm
not
sure
watson
changes
that.
and
we
did
not
succeed
on
the
statistics.
so
i
don't
think...
and,
but
we
just
don't
think
title
vii
gets
boxed
that
way,
so
that
7(a)(2)
is,
703(a)(2)
is
disparate
impact
and
not
disparate
treatment
as
well.
in
other
words,
the
statute
does
not
work
in
these
nice
cubby
holes
that
way.
so
what
we
do
believe,
if
the
clear
and
convincing
is
perhaps
the
one
point
where
we
think
we
are
well
out
beyond
the
decisions
of
this
court,
is
that
that
is
the
proper
solution
to
a
case
in
which
there
is
a
kind
of
smog
over
a
motivation
now,
because
there
have
been
two
factors
probably,
and
one
of
them
is
a
forbidden
one.
and
that
the
employer
has
the
records,
the
employer
has
the
history,
the
employer
has
a
knowledge
of
its
own
motives.
it
ought
to
be
able
to
make
a
clear
and
convincing
case.
it
should
be
able
to
do
that
by
pointing
to
history,
it
should
be
able
to
do
that
by
pointing
to
a
written
standard,
if
that's
so.
but...
i'm
sorry,
justice
white.
mr.
james
h.
heller
oh,
excuse
me.
i
thought
i
was
burning
you.
but
that,
if
one
says
that,
i
also
think
clear
and
convincing
says
something
about
the
kind
of
proof
that
is
wanted.
we
are,
we
are
perhaps
in
the
last
analysis
less
concerned
about
the
quantum
than
we
are
this
court
instructing
lower
courts
that
you've
got
to
say
something
more
than
what,
in
the
teamsters
it
said
were
general
affirmations
of
good
faith.
that's
not
where
the
case
is
now.
you
must
come
forward
and
say,
we
would
have
done
this
but
for.
and
as
to
87
male
candidates,
not
one
of
them
could
have
established
that
they
were
going
to
become
partners
but
for
a
single
factor
in
the
world.
actually
47
did
and
21
didn't.
that
is
the
kind
of
impossible
burden
of
proof
that
will
simply
extinguish
title
vii
suits
and
collegial
decision
making
would
likely,
by
subjective
standards,
would
likely
become
a
very
common
form
of
practice,
because
it
would
be
impenetrable.
and
that
too,
given
the
policy
of
the
act,
the
history
of
the
act,
the
defeat
of
the
mcclellan
amendment,
with
senator
case,
is
a
very
clear
statement
about
it.
the
1972
amendment,
when
this
court
said
that
a
new
statute
that
said,
any
discrimination
is,
violates
this
act,
and
said
that
is
assimilated
to
the
standards
under
old
title
vii.
all
of
that,
we
think,
argues
for
saying,
liability
is
not
a
demanding
standard,
or
anywhere
near
the
demanding
standard
that
price
waterhouse
insists.
remedy
is
where
they
may
be
able
to
show
that
they
did
something
that
should
not
have
a
consequence
of
the
sort
that
we
ask
for
in
the
complaint
in
this
case.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
will
then
sit
down.
