ms.
kathi
alyce
drew
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
the
public
burning
of
an
american
flag
which
occurred
as
part
of
a
demonstration
with
political
overtones
is
entitled
to
first
amendment
protection.
the
flag
burning
in
this
case
occurred
during
the
1984
republican
national
convention
in
dallas,
texas.
the
flag
was
burning
in
front
of
dallas
city
hall
at
the
culmination
of
a
demonstration
march
through
downtown
dallas
in
the
midst
of
a
crowd
of
demonstrators
and
on
lookers.
the
flag
burner,
who
was
identified
as
mr.
johnson,
was
convicted
under
a
texas
statute
which
prohibits
desecration
of
the
national
flag.
his
punishment
was
assessed
at
one
year
in
the
county
jail
plus
a
$2,000
fine.
the
conviction
was
affirmed
on
direct
appeal
by
the
intermediate
court
of
appeals.
mr.
johnson
then
filed
petition
for
discretionary
review
to
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals.
that
is
the
highest
court
in
the
state
of
texas
which
hears
criminal
cases.
the
court
granted
his
petition,
reversed
his
conviction,
and
ordered
the
information
dismissed.
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
held
that
the
texas
statute
was
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
mr.
johnson,
since
he
was
a
political
protester.
judge
campbell
of
that
court
found
that
flag
burning
constituted
symbolic
speech
within
the
test
enunciated
by
this
court
in
spence
versus
washington.
that
court
also
found
that
texas'
asserted
interests
in
regulating
the
act
of
flag
burning
were
insufficient
to
outweigh
a
protestor's
first
amendment
rights
to
expression.
for
purposes
of
this
argument
today
and
with
the
court's
indulgence,
the
state
will
assume
the
symbolic
speech
standard
and
proceed
directly
to
the
question
of
texas'
compelling
interest
in
regulating
this
type
of
conduct.
throughout
the
course
of
the
appellate
history
in
this
case
texas
has
advanced
two
compelling
state
interests.
one
is
the
preservation
of
the
flag
as
a
symbol
of
nationhood
and
national
unity.
the
second
is
the
preservation
of
a
breach
of
the
peace.
ms.
kathi
alyce
drew
yes,
your
honor,
prevention
as
opposed
to
punishment
for
a
breach
of
the
peace.
i
would
like
to
address
first
the
nationhood
interest.
we
believe
that
preservation
of
the
flag
as
a
symbol
of
nationhood
and
national
unity
is
a
compelling
and
valid
state
interest.
we
feel
very
certain
that
congress
has
the
power
to
both
adopt
a
national
symbol
and
to
take
steps
to
prevent
the
destruction
of
that
symbol,
to
protect
the
symbol.
ms.
kathi
alyce
drew
your
honor,
we
believe
that
if
a
symbol
over
a
period
of
time
is
ignored
or
abused
that
it
can,
in
fact,
lose
its
symbolic
effect.
ms.
kathi
alyce
drew
your
honor,
i'm
forced
to
disagree
with
you.
ms.
kathi
alyce
drew
because
i
believe
that
every
desecration
of
the
flag
carried
out
in
the
manner
that
he
did
here...
and
certainly
i
don't
think
there
can
be
any
question
that
mr.
johnson
is
a
hard-core
violator
of
this
statute...
if
his
actions
in
this
case
under
the
facts
of
this
case
do
not
constitute
flag
desecration,
then
i
really
am
not
quite
certain
what
would
constitute
flag
desecration.
ms.
kathi
alyce
drew
texas
is
not
suggesting
that
we
can
insist
on
respect.
we
are
suggesting
that
we
have
the
right
to
preserve
the
physical
integrity
of
the
flag
so
that
it
may
serve
as
a
symbol
because
its
symbolic
effect
is
diluted
by
certain
flagrant
public
acts
of
flag
desecration.
ms.
kathi
alyce
drew
yes,
your
honor.
we...
to
the
expect...
to
the
extent
that
we
are
asking
for
any
respect
for
the
flag,
we
are
asking
for
respect
for
its
physical
integrity.
certainly
we
do
not
demand
that
any
individual
view
it
with
any
discernable
emotion
whatsoever,
only
that
its
physical
integrity
be
respected.
and
i
think
that
that
is
a
very
minimal
basis
to
ask
from
any
individual.
and
that
is
really
all
texas
is
suggesting
with
this
is
that
we
have
got
to
preserve
the
symbol
by
preserving
the
flag
itself
because
there
really
is
no
other
way
to
do
it.
there
is
nothing
that
would
accomplish
this
particular
purpose
if
you
cannot
protect
the
physical
integrity
of
the
flag.
ms.
kathi
alyce
drew
that's
true,
your
honor.
ms.
kathi
alyce
drew
your
honor,
i
don't
believe,
though,
that
a
cross
has
quite
the
same
character
that
the
american
flag
does
because
there
are
many
people
in
this
nation
who
would
not
view
a
cross
as
a
symbol.
ms.
kathi
alyce
drew
and
this
particular
statute,
your
honor,
would
not
go
to
that
sort
of
a
symbol.
this
particular
statute,
i
believe,
in
this
respect
recognizes
that
the
flag
is
a
national
property,
that
it
belongs
to
all
people,
that
all
people
are
entitled
to
view
it
symbolically
in
whatever
way
that
they
wish.
some
people
may
give
it
great
respect.
others
may
not.
that's
not
what
we're
regulating
here.
we
are
simply
trying
to
preserve
the
flag
as
a
symbol
for
all
people.
the
issue--
ms.
kathi
alyce
drew
--we
are
assuming
that
standard
for
purposes
today.
ms.
kathi
alyce
drew
to
a
certain
extent,
we
have
made
that
argument
in
our
brief.
with
respect
to
the
symbolic
speech
standard,
we
believe
that
there
are
compelling
state
interests
that
will
in
a
balancing
posture
override
this
individual's
symbolic
speech
rights,
and
that
preserving
the
flag
as
a
symbol,
because
it
is
such
a
national
property,
is
one
of
those.
ms.
kathi
alyce
drew
the
other
state
interest
advanced
your
honor,
is
a
prevention
of
a
breach
of
the
peace.
ms.
kathi
alyce
drew
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
kathi
alyce
drew
51
flags
or
all
50
state
flags
but
the
national
flag?
i'm
confused
by
your
question.
i
apologize.
ms.
kathi
alyce
drew
yes,
it
does.
ms.
kathi
alyce
drew
yes.
ms.
kathi
alyce
drew
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
kathi
alyce
drew
the
statute
does
say
a
state
or
national
flag.
that
is
correct.
and
we
do
believe
texas
certainly
has
a
right
to
protect
its
own
flag.
and
i
think
that
a
similar
interest
would
be
for
sister
states.
so,
the
statute
says
a
state
or
national
flag.
ms.
kathi
alyce
drew
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
ms.
kathi
alyce

no,
your
honor,
it
would
not
be
the
same
interest
i
don't
believe.
ms.
kathi

there
is
legislation,
your
honor,
which
does
establish
the
blue
bonnet
as
the
state
flower.
ms.
kathi
alyce

it
does
not
seek
to
protect
it.
ms.
kathi
alyce

your
honor,
i
think
texas
in
this
area
has
made
a
judgment
that
certain
items...
and
the
statute
itself
is
not
limited
to
just
the
flag.
the
portion
that
is
in
question
here
is
limited
to
the

it

a
judgment
that
certain

ms.

we're
not

at

we
are

arguing
that

cannot
dishonor
the
flag
or
that
one
cannot
demonstrate
disrespect
for
the
flag.
individuals
have
that
right.
what
we
are
arguing
is
that
you
may
not
publicly
desecrate
a
flag
regardless
of
the
motivation
for
your
action.
ms.
kathi

i
don't

i

well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
the
same
conduct

ms.
kathi

it
is
possible--

--that
an
individual
could
choose
to
burn
a
flag
as
an
honor
for
all
the
individuals

died
in

this
is
their
most
prized
possession.

ms.

not

of

to

manner

correct,

ms.
kathi
alyce
drew
i
don't
believe
that
it

because
i
believe
that
the
pivotal
point
is
in
a
way
how
is
the
conduct
effectuated,
how
is
it
done,
not
what
an
individual
may
be
trying
to
say,
not
how
onlookers
perceive
the
action,
not
how
the
crowd
reacts,
but
how
is
it
done.
if
you
take
your
flag
into
your
basement
in
the
dead
of
night,
soak
it
with
lighter
fluid
and
ignite
it,
you
probably
have
not
violated
this
statute,
because
the
texas
statute
is
restricted
to
certain
limited
forms
of
flag
desecration.
ms.
kathi

honor,
as
a
matter
of
fact
there

the...

of
the

that
in

of
the
mercantile
bank
building
he
saw
several
of
the
protestors
bend
a
flag
pole
and
remove
an
american
flag.
they
then
handed
this
flag
to
mr.
johnson,
who
wadded
it
up
and
stuck
it
under

he
tried
to

i

that
there
is
a
shred
of
evidence
in
this
record
to
support
the
fact
that

that
problems
were
of
proof
there

that
no
one
saw
him
actually
take
it.
in
fact,
the
testimony
was
that
others
took
it
and
then
gave
it
to
him.
and
i
believe
that
it
was
felt
that
there
were
so
many
proof
problems
that
a
prosecution
was
very
speculative
under
those
facts.
there
also
might
have
been
some
problem
with
placing
a
monetary
value
on
the
flag
for
purposes
of
prosecution,

is
necessary

the
statute.

i

our

detailed
several
arguments
of
what
is
unique
about
the
symbol.
ms.
kathi
alyce
drew
i
think
it's
very
clear
that
the
flag
is
the
manifestation,
the
visible
manifestation
of
over
200
years
of
history
in
this
nation,
and
that
it
has
remained
virtually
unchanged
in
design.
the
13
stripes
represent
the
original
13
colonies,
and
every
state
is
represented
on
the
field
of
blue
by
a
star.
it
is
very
unique.
it
is
immediately
recognizable
to
almost
anyone

it.
ms.

kathi

could

own

display
48-star
flags.

--that
would
depend,
i
believe,
your
honor,
on
how
flag
is
defined.
there
are
certain
definitions
that
are
given.
congress
itself
has
defined
what
it
means
by
the
flag
of
the
united
states.
and,
as
part
and
parcel
of
that
definition,
there
is
language
that
says
"the
stars
and
stripes
in
any
number
which
to
an
individual
who
looks
at
it
without...
without
deliberation,
may
be
a
flag.
"
the
flag
behind
you
looks
to
me
to
be
a
flag,
but
i
cannot
count
50
stars
on
it.
ms.
kathi
alyce
drew
if
there
were
any
question,
i
would
think
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
a
jury
to
resolve
that
question,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
turn
very
briefly,
if
i
may,
to
the
breach
of
the
peace
interest.
we
do
feel
that
preventing
a
breach
of
the
peace
is
a
legitimate
state
interest.
and,
indeed,
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
recognized
that
preventing
a
breach
of
the
peace
is
a
legitimate
state
interest.
again,
the
texas
legislature
has
made
a
judgment
in
this
area
that
public
desecration
is
likely
to
lead
to
violence,
that
it
can
lead
to
violence.
and
i
think
the
record
in
this
case
is
abundantly
clear
that
it
is
merely
fortuitous,
it
is
our
good
luck
that
a
breach
of
the
peace
did
not
occur
as
a
result
of
this
particular
flag
desecration.
the
appropriate
test
to
be
utilized
in
this
area
has
not
been
decided
by
this
court.
there
are
two
lines
of
cases.
one
is
that
public
desecration
of
a
flag
is
inherently
inflammatory.
another
is
that
immanence
must
be
shown.
and
i
believe
that
this
record
is
very
clear
that
texas
could
regulate
under
either
theory.
and,
again,
the
goal
is
a
prevention
of
a
breach
of
the
peace,
not
a
punishment
for
a
breach
of
the
peace.
and
in
analyzing
this
particular
statute,
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
utilized
a
much
higher
standard
than
any
court
has
ever
used
before.
they
went
to
an
actual
breach
of
the
peace
and
they
said
well,
there
was
no
actual
breach
of
the
peace.
that's
true.
individuals
who
were
seriously
offended
by
this
conduct
were
not
moved
to
violence.
if
they
were,
they
exercised
restraint.
but
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
dispositive
of
the
state's
interest
and
because
its
interest
is
different,
the
standard
is
different.
and
i
believe
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
suggestions
in
this
regard
are
a
bit
too
narrow;
that
if
you
have
to
show
an
actual
breach
of
the
peace,
your
purpose
in
a
flag
desecration
statute
is
obviated.
some
other
statute
would
serve
that
interest,
but
not
a
flag
desecration
standard
because
its
purpose
is
prevention.

there
are
other
sections
of
this
statute
where
other
items
are
protected,

public
monuments,
places

burial
and
worship.
i
don't
believe
that
anyone
could
suggest
that
one
may
paint
swastikas
on
the

is

the
amici
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
mr.
johnson
in
this
case
by
the
american
civil
liberties
union
confesses
that
there
is
no
first
amendment
interest
in
protecting
desecrations
of
either
public
monuments
or
places
of
worship
or
burial
because
they
are...
and
this
is
a
direct
quote
from
footnote
7,
page
18
of
their
brief...
"someone
else's
cherished
property".
i
think
the
flag
is
this
nation's
cherished
property,
that
every
individual
has
a
certain
interest.
the
government
may
maintain
a
residual
interest,
but
so
do
the
people.
and
you
protect
the
flag
because
it
is
such
an
important
symbol
of
national
unity.
ms.
kathi
alyce
drew
many
justices
of
this
court
have
held
that
the
flag
is
a
national
property.
unless
the
court
has
additional
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
kathi
alyce
drew
thank
you,
your
honor.
one
or
two
points
very,
very
briefly.
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
information
that
was
filed
or
in
the
jury
charge
that
was
submitted
to
the
court
which
would
have
authorized
a
conviction
for
any
words
that
had
been
spoken
by
mr.
johnson.
it
is
true
that
the
trial
prosecutor
did
make
about
half
a
page
in
his
20
page
summation
to
the
jury,
a
reference
to
the
law
of
parties
because
an
individual
for
a
criminal
offense
in
texas
can
be
held
liable
as
a
party
if
certain
factors
are
shown.
and
i
think
that
was
incumbent
upon
him,
but
there
is
absolutely
nothing
that
would
have
authorized
a
conviction
for
any
words
that
were
spoken.
i
also
fall
to
see
how,
if
i
understand
mr.
kunstler's
concession,
if
one
can
protect
government
flags
why
one
cannot
protect
a
flag
which
is
not
necessarily
the
property
of
the
government
because
the
danger
of
a
breach
of
the
peace
is
the
same
and
the
denigration
to
the
symbol
is
the
same.
unless
the
court
has
questions,
that
will
conclude
my
remarks.
