mr.
william
m.
kunstler
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
some
of
the
steam
has
been
taken
out
of
me
by
some
of
the
questions
and
some
of
the
responses
and
the
concession
by
the
state.
but
i
would
like
to
suggest
briefly
to
state
that
this
particular
act
that
we're
concerned
with
here,
this
42.09(a)(3)
of
the
texas
statute
singles
out
communicative
impact
for
punishment.
now,
ms.
drew
has
avoided
that
by
now...
and
virtually
the
state
now
apparently
concedes
that
you
can
write
out
of
a
statute
what
justice
o'connor
referred
to,
the
question
of
whether
the
actor
knows
or
means
that
what
he's
doing
will
seriously
offend
one
or
more
persons
likely
to
observe
or
destroy
or
discover
his
particular
act.
that's
out
of
the
statute,
apparently,
according
to
the
argument
because
in
the
reply
brief
and
today
she
has
said
essentially
what
is
in
the
reply
brief.
like
gertrude
stein,
"a
rose
is
a
rose",
they
now
say
"a
flag
burning
is
a
flag
burning.
"
and
they
read
out
of
the
statute
under
which
he
was
convicted
and
which
went
to
the
jury
and
the
charge
on
the
question
of
seriously
offend,
that's
all
out
as
far
as
ms.
drew
is
concerned.
but
it's
not
out
as
far
as
this
court
is
concerned.
that's
what
the
conviction
was
about,
that's
what
the
argument
to
the
jury
was
about,
that's
what
the
charge
was
about.
they
all
mention
that.
that's
what
the
witnesses,
stover,
tucker,
and
walker,
testified
to,
that
they
were
seriously
offended.
so,
this
depends
on
communicative
impact
for
punishment.
they've
conceded
it's
pure
speech.
they
raise
no
question
arguendo,
even,
essentially
that
it
is
not
speech,
and
concede
that.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
well,
that's--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--i
can
understand
that
rationale,
but
in
reading
the
reply
brief,
the
reply
brief
said
in
essence
we
virtually
take
that
out
of
the
statute.
we
rewrite
the
statute
now,
and
we
say
essentially
a
flag
burning
is
a
flag
burning,
and
that
offense
goes
out
of
it,
offense
whether
communicated
later
or
not
communicated
later,
whether
it
occurs
or
it
doesn't
occur,
i
thought
that's
what
the
reply
brief
did.
now,
maybe
i
do
misstate
her
argument
slightly,
but
i
don't
think
i
mistake
the
reply
brief,
because
i
got
the
impression
that's...
well,
the
words,
"a
flag
burning
is
a
flag
burning.
"
is
in
the
reply
brief.
now,
i
remember,
justice
scalia,
in
reading
your
dissent
in
community
for
creative
nonviolence
that
you
said
essentially,
"a
law
directed
at
the
communicative
nature
of
conduct
must
like
a
law
directed
at
speech
itself
be
justified
by
the
substantial
showing
of
need
that
the
first
amendment
requires.
"
i
subscribe
to
that
wholeheartedly.
in
fact,
you
went
on
and
you
reviewed
all
of
the
cases
that
you
thought
were
applicable
there,
stromberg,
brown,
tinker
and
spence,
and
you
made
the
following
statement:
"every
prescription
of
expressive
conduct
in
those
cases
was
aimed
at
the
communicative
effect
of
the
conduct.
"
and
that's
what
they
had
here.
that's
what
the
jury
got,
that's
what
the
testimony
was,
and
that's
what
the
statute
says.
and
i
agree
with...
i
think--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--i
understand.
[laughter]
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
in
any
event,
we
subscribe
to
that,
of
course,
in
our
argument,
and
i
think
justice
o'connor
when
she
wrote
boos
she
said
essentially,
this
justification,
folks,
is
only
on
the
content
of
the
speech
and
the
direct
impact
that
speech
has
on
its
listeners.
and
in
cohen
i
think
justice
white
in
his
concurrence
said
that
the...
that
statute
made
the
communicative
aspect
of
the
proscribed
conduct
a
crucial
element
of
the
violation.
that's
the
contemptuous
treatment
statute,
and
that's
what
we
have
here.
everything
depends
on
the
communication
that
is
made
by
the
actor
which
may
be
communicated
to
the
people
on
the
street,
but
you
know
in
the
statute,
justice
scalia,
it
goes
even
further,
"likely
to
observe
or
discover",
which
could
be
in
the
newspapers
the
next
day,
for
example,
as
well
as
being
an
onlooker.
so,
i
think
that
given
the
concession
that
the
statute
is
pure
speech,
given
the
past
decisions
of
this
court
on
what
should
happen
to
a
statute
that
makes
communicative
impact,
the
criterion
of
the
punishment
that
this
statute
fails
that
test,
it
certainly
doesn't
come
under
o'brien
because
where...
here
the
government's
interest
is
directly
related
to
expression.
it's
like
footnote
8
in
spence,
and
i
think
what
you
have
here
is
a
statute
that
depends
solely
and
exclusively
on
communicative
impact
on
the
audience,
whether
they're
there
or
they
read
it
in
the
newspaper
or
they
see
it
on
the
screen
in
the
evening.
it
all
goes
to
that.
and
when
you
use
the
word
desecrate,
you
don't
mean
really
in
essence
praising
the
flag.
desecrate
has
a...
has
a...
has
a
meaning,
and
i
just
looked
at
it
in
webster's
second
international
about
it,
and
desecrate
means
to
divest
of
a
sacred
character
or
office,
to
divert
from
a
sacred
purpose,
to
violate
the
sanctity
of,
to
profane,
the
opposite
of
consecrate.
now,
with
reference
to
the
compelling
state
interest,
i
listened
to
the
argument
of
flower
to
star
against
b.j.f.
before
here,
and
i
don't
want
to
hurt
mr.
rahdert's
argument
in
this
argument,
knowing
nothing
about
the
case
except
what
i
heard
today,
but
i
thought
that
the
protection
of
a
rape
victim
was
a
compelling
state
interest.
i
agreed
with
justice
o'connor's
comments
on
that.
that
is
a
compelling
interest,
certainly.
here
you
have
no
compelling
state
interest
that
is
worth
consideration.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
that
may
be
true.
is
he
in
the
room
yet?
i
hope
not.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
now,
we're
getting
back
to
my
argument.
with
reference
to
the
nationhood
and
national
unity,
which
ms.
drew
raised
and
which
is
filled
in
the
brief,
both
the
reply
brief
and
the
main
brief
of
the
state,
i
think...
i
thought
barnette
set
that
to
rest.
i
thought
that
when
justice
jackson
said
that
if
there
is
any
fixed
star
in
our
constitutional
constellation,
it
is
that
no
official
high
or
petty
can
prescribe
what
shall
be
orthodox
in
politics,
nationalism--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--and
here,
chief
justice,
you're
asking...
people
are
required
not
to
do
something.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
and
i
think
that's
a
comparable
situation.
we
order
you...
we
can't
order
you
to
salute
the
flag,
we
can't
order
you
to
do
all
these
obeisances
with
relation
to
the
flag.
can
we
order
you
not
to
do
something
to
show
something
about
the
flag?
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
well,
you
know,
i
understand
that,
but
i
think
that
you
get
into
street,
i
thought,
which
also
relied
on
barnette.
there
he
did
exactly
what
we're
talking
about
here.
he
burnt
the
flag
in
the
street
over
the
question
of
james
meredith
being
shot
in
mississippi
in
1966.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
well,
in
street
essentially
the
court
indicated
that
you
couldn't
tell
whether
it
was
speech
or
whether
it
was
flag
burning
and,
therefore,
the
court
reversed
in
the
street
case.
but
in
so
deciding
in
relying
on
barnette,
the
court
said,
essentially
i
thought,
that
it
was
an
illegitimate
interest
in
street
to
compel
respect
by
prohibiting
criticism
of
the
flag,
including
flag
burning.
so,
i
think
it's...
i
guess
we
have
a
little
difference
of
opinion
on
the
facts.
i
know
the
facts
are
somewhat
different
except
a
flag
was
burned
in
the
street
by
mr.
street
in
a
political
protest
over
a
shooting
in
mississippi
of
a
civil
rights
figure.
but
i
think
the
analogy
is
the
same.
can
you
say
you
can't
force
them
to
salute
the
flag
or
pledge
allegiance
to
the
flag,
but
can
you
then
say
we
can
force
them
not
to
show
other
means
of
disrespect
for
the
flag,
other
means
of
protest
over
the
flag
by
saying
you
can't
burn
the
flag?
i
think
they're
the
same,
in
all
due
deference.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i
don't
know
if
i've
convinced
you,
but--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--i
certainly
do.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
no,
but
i
think
in
wooley,
as
i
recall
it,
they
painted
out.
they
did
an
affirmative
act
and
painted
out
the
"live
free
or
die"
motto.
the
jehovah's
witnesses
didn't
believe
in
that,
so
they
painted
it
out.
they
did
enact
and
then
the
question
was
was
that
act
violating
some
criminal
code.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i
know.
that...
i
would
agree
with
you
on
that,
but
i
think
that
to
get
away
from
wooley
against
maynard
would
be
a
mistake
here.
that...
that's
putting
something
on
the
license
plate
that
is
profane
or
whatever.
but
in...
in
wooley,
as
i
understood
it,
the
act
that
they,
jehovah's
witnesses
did,
was
to
paint
out.
they
burnt
the
flag.
in
essence.
they
painted
out.
i
don't
think
we're
going
to
reach
eye
to
eye
on
this.
[laughter]
i
have
that
distinct
feeling.
getting
back,
then,
to
the
no
compelling
state
interest,
though,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
compelling
state
interest
in
the
state
of
texas...
and
by
the
way,
the
national
flag
does
not
just
mean
the
american
flag.
there
is
a
presidential
flag...
they
don't
put
it
in
capitals...
there's
a
presidential
flag
that
is
flown.
the
secretary
of
state
has
a
flag
that's
a
national
flag.
there
are
many
national
flags.
i
counted
17
national
flags.
each
department
here
in
washington
has
a
flag.
they're
national
flags,
and
the
state
of
texas
would
also
include
those
as
national
flags,
certainly
the
president's
flag.
so,
i
think
that
the
word
"national"
flag
needs
definition
in
itself.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
what
was
that?
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i
don't
know,
but
the
republican
party
has
one--
[laughter]
--because
when
they
went
by
the
mercantile
bank
building
here...
i
just
learned
this
from
the
record...
the...
one
of
their
witnesses,
jimmy
smith,
who
is
the
custodian
of
the
flags
at
the
marcantile
bank
said,
"we
took
down
four
american
flags.
"
"we
have
16
normally,
because
we
put
up
four
republican
party
flags
because
the
republican
party
was
then
meeting
in
its
annual
convention...
in
its
national
convention.
"
so,
i
know
the
republican
party.
if
the
supreme
court
doesn't
have
one
or
has
one,
i
don't
know.
i
think
you'd
be
in
a
better
position
than
me
to
tell
that
anyway.
by
the
way,
talking
about
flags
in
front
of
the
supreme
court,
when
i
came
by
today,
the
flags
were
up
in
the
rain,
and
under
36
u.s.
code,
the
leading
provision
there
is
flags
shall
not
be
displayed
in
inclement
weather.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
that's
in
all
weather
flags.
[laughter]
that
could
be
physical
mistreatment
under
the
texas
statute.
you
get
into
vaguenes.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
yes,
i'm
getting
back
to
the
case.
[laughter]
seems
to
me
we
had
this
three
weeks
ago.
in
any
event,
i
don't
think
that
the...
there
is
a
compelling
state
interest
in
this
flag
or
any
national
flag
whatsoever.
i
think
the
court
has
really
held
that--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--i
don't
know,
but
i
don't
think
it
matters
because
they're
not
criminal
statutes.
they
are
recommendations.
it
used
to
be
you
couldn't
fly
the
flag
at
night.
now,
you
can
fly
it
if
it's
illuminated,
and
so
on.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
they're
recommendations.
there
are
no
criminal
penalties.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i
don't
believe
so.
i
don't...
i'm
thinking
in
my
mind
whether
they
have
any
injunctive
power.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i
don't
see
any
state
interest
whatsoever.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i
don't
know.
since
halter
against
nebraska,
where
there
was
a
nebraska
statute
against
using
the
flag
on
beer
bottles
or
beer
cans,
i
don't
know
whether
there
can
be
any
prohibition
of
that.
it's
used
all
over
for
commercial
purposes.
i
notice
that
barbara
bush
wore
a
flag
scarf,
for
example.
there
are
flag
bikinis,
there
are
flag
everything.
there
are
little
cocktail
flags
that
you
put
into
a
hot
dog
or
a
meatball
and
then
throw
in
the
garbage
pall.
they're
flags
under
the
texas
statute,
something
made
out
of
cloth,
but
i
think
they're
are
all
sorts
of
flags
used
commercially.
i'm
not
sure
in
my
heart
whether
i
think
there's
any
control
over
the
use
of
the
flag,
not
on
the
criminal
side
anyway.
whether
there
is
a...
in
answering
justice
stevens'
question
whether
there
is
an
injunctive
process
that
can
be
employed
or
not...
i...
i...
i
won't
go
into
it.
but
i
have
an
instinctive
feeling
that's
different,
apparently,
then
justice
stevens'
that
there
is
no
control
of
the
use
of
the
flag
commercially,
although
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
for
this
case
because
here
we're
only
talking
about
a
criminal
statute.
now,
with
reference
to...
when
i
read
justice
white's
concurrence
in
goguen,
i
notice
he
said
that
punishment
for
communicating
ideas
about
the
flag
unacceptable
to
controlling
majority
in
the
legislature
is
something
that
is
wrong,
to
punish
people
for
having
a
different
idea
about
the
flag,
different
than
the
texas
legislature
has
with
the
flag
in
its
desecration
statute.
and
by
the
way,
that's
called
the
desecration
of
venerated
objects.
that's
the
classification
they
give
to
it.
and
i
agree
with
justice
scalia
that
flag
burning
of
a
single
flag
in
front
of
the
new
city
hall
in
dallas
doesn't
lessen
the
value
as
a
symbol.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
you
might
have
a
case
there.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
if
a
person
that
joins
the
army,
the
flag
has
even
a
more
peculiar
significance
to
people
in
the
army.
i
would
have
problems
with
it.
i
would
represent
such
a
person--
[laughter]
--because
i
would
think
that
there's
something
first
amendment
in
there.
but
if
he
destroyed
a
flag
that
was
the
property
of
the
army,
i
think
he'd
be
court
martialed
for
that.
i
don't
think
there's
a
particular
flag
statute
in
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
if
you
destroy
someone's
flag,
you
can
be
punished.
there
are
many
statutes.
i
think
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
pointed
there
are
some
statutes,
this
statute
and
that
statute
that
would
cover
the
situation
without
getting
into
the
first
amendment
area.
and
i'm
sure
it
would
violate
the
article
of
war...
i
used
to
call
it
the
article
of
war...
which
says
"conduct
unbecoming
a
member
of
the
military.
"
if
you
destroyed
a
flag...
refused...
even
refused
to
salute
a
flag
under
the
military
code.
now,
with
reference
to
the
breach
of
the
peace--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--yeah.
i'm
not
saying...
i
don't
want
you
to
get
the
wrong--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--impression
that
i
say
it's
totally
out
of
reach.
i'm
not
saying
that.
i'm
trying
to
confine
it
to
this
case.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i
know
i
did.
[laughter]
i
guess
i
have
too
much
of
a
first
amendment
consciousness,
i
guess,
in
my
makeup.
with
reference
to
breach
of
the
peace,
i
don't
think
there's
ever...
none
of
the
flag
cases
that
you
have
before
you...
ever
had
before
you...
have
involved
a
breach
of
the
peace.
the
only
one
i
found
where
there
was
any
violence
was
what
judge
tuttle
found
in
the
monroe
case,
where
they
burned
an
american
flag
in
front
of
the
federal
building
and
someone
burned
an
iranian
flag.
when
the
iranian
flag
was
burned,
there
was
one
act
of
violence,
but
not
when
the
american
flag
was
burned.
and
judge
tuttle
pointed
out
that
there
was
no
clear
and
present
danger.
he
went
right
into
the
old
holmesian
doctrine
of
"clear
and
present
danger"
just
as
there
wasn't
here.
if
there
had
been
a
breach--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--well,
i
don't
think
that
changes
the
position
yet
because
it's
no
different
than
terminiello,
really.
you're
saying
hard
things.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i
know
it,
and
apparently
the
imminence
there
was
so
immanent--
[laughter]
--thank
you...
was
so
immanent.
but
you
don't
have
that
here
at
all.
in
terminiello,
as
you
know,
when
i
was
reading
terminiello's
remarks
in
the
transcript,
there
was...
it
showed
he
ducked
several
times.
apparently
someone
threw
something
during
his
rampage
against
the
jews,
but
they
held...
this
court
held
that
that
wasn't
enough.
it
wasn't
really
raised
very
much
in
the
argument.
but
if
it
gets
to
imminent
danger
where
you
really
have
something
going
on,
which
you
didn't
have
here,
and
you
haven't
had
in
any
of
the
flag
burning
cases,
there's
no
breach
of
the
peace
here
and
no
imminence
of
the
breach
of
the
peace
here
at
all.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
well,
skokie
presents
a
situation,
of
course,
where
the
attempt
to
parade
through
an
all
white
community
of
black
demonstrators...
but
even
there,
of
course,
you
can't
stop
it.
you
can't
stop
it.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
it
you're
going
to
stop
it,
it
has
to
be
so
imminent
as
the
chief
said...
it
has
to
be
so
imminent
that
it
really
reaches
clear
and
present
danger
proportions.
that's
where
judge
tuttle
said
in
monroe,
and
i
think
that
is
the
rule
here.
we
haven't
argued
clear
and
present
danger
yet,
but
i
think
you
must
at
least
show
some
clear
and
present
danger,
some
imminence.
the...
the
statute
here
is
not
limited
to
an
imminent
breach,
by
the
way.
it
doesn't
say
imminent
breach
of
the
peace
at
all.
it
just
says
"likely"
or
"might"
or,
"the
actor
could
reasonably
believe
that
someone
might
be
seriously
offended
by
it.
"
the
texas
court
of
appeals
treated
this,
i
think,
in
its
opinion.
it
said,
"this
statute
is
so
broad
that
it
may
be
used
to
punish
protected
conduct
which
has
no
propensity
to
result
in
breaches
of
the
peace.
"
serious
offense
does
not
always
result
in
a
breach
of
the
peace.
the
protest
in
this
case
did
not
lead
to
violence.
and,
i
might
add,
in
this
protest
they
had
policemen
right
along
with
them,
undercover
police
officers.
the
crowd
was
not
a
large
crowd.
they
estimate
between
100,
110,
and
texas
went
on
to
say,
as
with
most
other
protests
of
this
nature,
police
were
present
at
the
scene.
a
witness
was
obviously
seriously
offended
by
appellant's
conduct
because
he
gathered
the
burned
flag
and
buried
it
at
his
home.
nevertheless
so
seriously
offended,
this
man
was
not
moved
to
violence.
serious
offense
occurred,
but
there
was
no
breach
of
the
peace,
nor
does
the
record
reflect
that
the
situation
was
potentially
explosive.
one
cannot
equate
serious
offense
with
incitement
to
breach
the
peace.
and
i
think
that
any
breach
of
the
peace
argument
here
falls
on
its
face.
it
is...
i
think
when
chief
justice
burger
said
in
o'brien
versus
skinner,
"it
is
not
our
function
to
construe...
to
construe
a
state
statute
contrary
to
the
construction
given
it
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state.
"
they
have
construed
this
statue
with
reference
certainly
to
breach
of
the
peace.
on
vagueness
and
overbreadth,
i
think
the
vagueness
is...
is
apparent.
it's...
by
definition
it's
vague.
what
does
"serious
offense"
mean?
what
is
"unserious
offense"
as
against
"serious
offense"?
some
of
the
aclu
witnesses
here
testified
here
they
were
offended.
they
thought
it
was
repulsive,
one
of
them
said,
but
they
were
not
seriously
offended.
and
i
don't
know
what
seriously
offended
means.
the
state
says
it's
in
the
dictionary,
and
therefore
it
must
have
a
meaning.
i
agree
with
that.
every
word
is
in
the
dictionary,
or
at
least
in
some
dictionaries.
but
just
because
they're
in
the
dictionary
doesn't
mean
that
you
can
define
legally
or
on
the
spot
what
serious
offense
is.
it
wasn't
a
serious
offense,
for
example,
to
fly
the
flag
outside
the
supreme
court
in
violation
of
36
usc.
the
artists'
amicus
brief,
which
i
think
is
a
most
unusual
brief,
contains
many,
many
of
the
artists'
paintings
where
you
might
say
that
they
created
paintings
that
would
seriously
offend
by
manipulating
the
american
flag
or
by
cutting
it
up,
destroying
it,
using
it
in
different
ways,
many
of
them
to
protest
situations.
some
of
them
go
to
the
war
in
vietnam.
some
of
them
go
to
other
aspects.
you
don't
even
know
what
physical
mistreatment
means
in
the
statute.
does
physical
mistreatment
mean
wearing
it,
twisting
it,
burning
it?
it's
just
an
undefinable
statute.
as
far
as
overbreadth
is
concerned
and
even
taking
into
consideration
justice
white's
substantial
overbreadth
argument,
this
is
substantially
overbroad--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--pardon
me.
but
i
read
it
and
i
saw
the
words
"substantial
overbreadth"
in
it,
and
i
think
this
even
meets
that
higher
standard
of
whether
it's
overbreadth.
it
sweeps
protected
conduct
under
its
aegis
and
is...
it's
just
an
overbroad
statute,
so
overbroad
that
i
don't
think
anyone
can
really
doubt
it.
and,
in
fact,
there's
been
no
real
argument
against
it,
against
the
overbreadth
argument
essentially
the
state
of
texas.
now,
with
reference
to
as
applied,
we
would
rely
on
the
street
case.
you
can't
tell
here
whether
he
was
convicted
with
reference
to
this
statute
as
to
the
flag
burning
or
as
to
the
words
or
the
acts
he
did
before
the
flag
burning
because
the
texas
prosecutor
in
his
summation
said
as
follows:
"if
you
look
at
this
evidence
from
start
to
finish.
"
--and
they
showed
a
lot
of
television
shots
of
what
was
happening
in
dallas
"if
you
look
at
this
evidence
from
start
to
finish,
the
participating
in
the
beginning,
the
literature,
the
last
notations,
rcyb,
the
shirt,
who
he
is,
the
chanting,
the
yelling,
the
megaphone,
the
encouragement,
the
having
the
megaphone,
being
there,
wanting
this
to
happen,
there
is
no
question
he
encouraged
it
all.
"
"he's
as
guilty
as
sin
as
far
as
the
law
of
parties
is
concerned.
"
that's
very
much
the
summation...
not
as
hyperbole
in
street
as
was
given
in
the
street
case.
was
he
really
tried
and
convicted
for
the
flag
or
for
the
encouragement
or
for
the
literature,
the
megaphone,
the
loudspeaker.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
no.
what
happened,
he
was
only
charged
initially
with
disorderly
conduct.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
he
was
charged
with...
i
have
the
charge
here.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
it's
an
information,
a
misdemeanor.
and
he
was
charged
eventually
only
with
the
flag
burning
statute
or
the
desecration
statute.
but
initially,
chief
justice,
he
was
charged...
they
took
in
a
hundred
protestors
a
half
hour
after
all
this
happened,
and
he
was
charged
initially
with
disorderly
conduct.
all
the
rest
were
let
go.
and
then
they
dropped
the
disorderly
conduct...
that's
in
the
record
somewhere...
the
keeper...
the
sheriff
came
and
testified
that
they
dropped
disorderly
conduct
and
substituted
in
its
place
the
flag
desecration
charge,
and
that's
what
he
was
charged
with.
disorderly
conduct
was
out
of
the
picture.
now,
with
reference
to...
so,
he
may
easily
here
have
been
convicted
for
the
words,
the
encouragement
as
against...
by
the
law
of
the
parties
as
against
the
flag
desecration
itself.
i
would
just
like
to
end
my
argument...
i
think
this
is
a
fundamental
first
amendment
case,
that
the
first
amendment
to
the
written
constitution
is
in
jeopardy
by
statutes
like
this.
and
i
wanted
to
essentially
close
with
two
remarks.
one
justice
jackson
said
in
barnette.
"those
who
begin
coercive
elimination
of
dissent
soon
find
themselves
eliminating
dissenters.
"
"compulsory
unification
of
opinion
achieves
only
the
unanimity
of
the
graveyard.
"
"the
first
amendment
was
designed
to
avoid
these
ends
by
avoiding
these
beginnings.
"
and
i
think
that's
an
important
statement
over
the
years
from
justice
jackson.
and
then
he
goes...
in
just
a
recent
article
in
the
new
york
times
called
"in
chicago
a
holy
war
over
the
flag.
"
by
j.
anthony
lukas,
a
very
excellent
former
reporter
for
the
new
york
times,
he
said,
"whatever
pain
freedom
of
expression
may
inflict,
it
is
a
principle
on
which
we
can
give
no
ground.
"
and
i
understand
that
this
flag
has
serious
important
meanings.
the
chief
has
mentioned
many
times
that
it
is
not
just
pieces
of
material,
blue
and
white
and
red.
that
has
real
meaning
to
real
people
out
there.
but
that
does
not
mean
that
it
may
have
different
meanings
to
other
people
out
there
and
that
they
may
not
under
the
first
amendment
show
their
feelings
by
what
texas
calls
desecration
of
a
venerated
object.
i
think
it's
a
most
important
case.
i
sense
that
it
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
first
amendment,
to
hear
things
or
to
see
things
that
we
hate
test
the
first
amendment
more
than
seeing
or
hearing
things
that
we
like.
it
wasn't
designed
for
things
we
like.
they
never
needed
a
first
amendment.
this
statute
or
this
amendment
was
designed
so
that
the
things
we
hate,
terminiello's
remarks,
burnings
of
flags,
or
what
have
you
can
have
a
place
in
the
marketplace
of
ideas
and
can
have
an
area
where
protest
can
find
itself,
i
submit
that
this
court
should
on
whatever
ground
it
feels
right,
should
affirm
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
with
reference
to
this
statute
and
this
conviction.
thank
you
very
much.
