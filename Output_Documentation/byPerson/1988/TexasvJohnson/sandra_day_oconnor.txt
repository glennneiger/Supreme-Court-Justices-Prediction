justice

could
texas
prohibit
the
burning
of
copies
of
the
constitution,
state
or
federal?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
wouldn't
be
the
same
interest
in
the
symbolism
of
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
actually,
ms.
drew--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--i
thought
this
statute
only
applied
if
the
desecration
were
done
in
a
way
that
the
actor
knows
will
offend
one
or
more
other
people
likely
to
discover
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
is
that
little
added
requirement,
is
there
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
you
think
that
that
added
requirement
survives
analysis
under
this
court's
cases
in
street
and
grayned
versus
city
of
rockford
and
so
forth?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
why?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
that
the
court
had
held
that
it's
firmly
settled
under
the
constitution,
that
the
public
expression
of
ideas
may
not
be
prohibited
merely
because
the
ideas
are
themselves
offensive
to
some
of
the
hearers.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
this
statute
seems
to
try
to
achieve
exactly
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
suppose
patrick
henry
and
any
of
the
founding
fathers
over
showed
disrespect
to
the
union
jack?
