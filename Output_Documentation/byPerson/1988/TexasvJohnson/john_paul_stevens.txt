justice
john
paul
stevens
--they'll
probably
violate
a
federal
statute
while
they're
doing
that,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
he
prosecuted
for
stealing
the
flag?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
wonder
why
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
right.
do
you...
you
said
that
this
flag
may
be
possibly
different
from
other
symbols.
you
don't
argue
that
there's
something
unique
about
this
flag?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
serious
in
that
answer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
the
tex...
that
the
texas
flower...
and
you
could
make
the
same
kind
of
argument
as
for
this
flag?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
haven't
really
made
an
argument
that
there's
anything
unique
about
this
symbol.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
mean,
i've
just...
what
i've
heard
this
afternoon
is
all
i'm
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kunstler,
let
me
ask
you...
and
maybe
this
gets
a
little
bit
away
from
the
case...
do
you
think
there
is
any
public
interest
at
all
in
any
of
these
regulatory
measures
about
don't
display
the
flag
in
the
rain
or
don't
fly
it
upside
down
or
so?
is
there
any
state
interest
at
all
to
support
that
kind
of
legislation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--do
you
think
the
federal
government
has
any
power
at
all
to...
to
regulate
how
this
flag
is
displayed
in
public
places?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
no
state
interest
whatsoever?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
feel
quite
differently.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
go
back
to
the
any
state
interest
at
all.
do
you
think
the
military
would
have
any
legitimate
interest
in
disciplining
a
member
of
the
military
who
showed
disrespect
for
the
flag
on
public
occasions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
might
have
a
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
was
only
suggesting
that
maybe
there
is
some...
some
identifiable
state
interest
that's
involved
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
you're
acknowledging
that
there
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
did
say
that.
