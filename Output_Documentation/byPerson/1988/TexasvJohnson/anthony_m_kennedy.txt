justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
oh,
over...
over
the
years,
over
the
centuries,
the
cross
has
been
respected.
i
recognize
one's
a
religious
symbol,
the
other's
a
national
one,
but
there's
no
legislation
that
has
appeared
necessary
to
protect,
say,
the
cross.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
it
may
be
that
you
can
protect
symbols
by
public
respect
and
by
measures
other
than
the
imposition
of
the
criminal
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
probably...
probably
maybe
arguably
less
than
the
flag.
i'm
not
sure
of
the
numbers,
but
it's
been
preserved.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
begin
by
saying
that
it's
a
symbol
and
by
acknowledging,
at
least
in
this
part
of
your
argument,
that
what
the
defendant
did
was
speech,
is
that
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
at
this
point.
what
is
the
juridical
category
you're
asking
us
to
adopt
in
order
to
say
we
can
punish
this
kind
of
speech?
just
an
exception
for
flags?
it's
just
a...
there's
just
a
flag
exception
of
the
first
amendment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
are
the
others?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
the
other
state
interest.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
assume
under
this
statute,
of
course,
it's
not
just
one
flag,
it's
51.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
this
statute
prohibits
the
desecration
of
a
state
flag
as
well.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
the
texas
state
flag?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
assume
if
we
upheld
the
statute
in
every
other
state
it
would
have
the
same
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
your
category
for
one
flag
is
now
expanded
to
51.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
gave
that
answer
before.
you
said
the
legislature
has
made
the
judgment.
but
you're
asking
us
to
define
and
to
articulate
a
constitutional
category.
and
from
what
i
can
see,
the
constitutional
category
is
that
we
simply
say
the
flag
is
different.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that...
but
that's
because
it's
public
property--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
unless
you
want
to
say
that
the
flag
is
somehow
public
property
of
us
all
and
ignore
traditional
distinctions
of
property,
then
your
example
just
doesn't
work.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
the
federal
government
prohibit
use
of
the
flag
for
commercial
purposes?
advertising?
