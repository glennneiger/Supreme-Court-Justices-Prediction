justice
antonin
scalia
now,
why
does...
why
does
the...
why
did
the
defendant's
actions
here
destroy
the
symbol?
his
actions
would
have
been
useless
unless
the
flag
was
a
very
good
symbol
for
what
he
intended
to
show
contempt
for.
his
action
does
not
make
it
any
less
a
symbol.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
not
at
all.
i
think...
i
think
when
somebody
does
that
to
the
flag,
the
flag
becomes
even
more
a
symbol
of
the
country.
i...
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
you're
running
quite
a
different
argument,
not
that
he's
destroying
its
symbolic
character,
but
that
he
is
showing
disrespect
for
it,
that
you
not
just
want
a
symbol,
but
you
want
a
venerated
symbol,
and
you
don't
make
that
argument
because
then
you're
getting
into...
into
a
sort
of
content
preference.
but
i
don't
see
how
you
can
argue
that
he's
making
it
any
less
of
a
symbol
than
it
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
desecrate
the
flag
indeed,
but
do
they
make
it...
do
they
destroy
the
symbol?
do
they
make
it
any
less
symbolic
of
the
country.
that's
the
argument
i
thought
you
were
running,
that...
that
we
have
a
right
to
have
a
national
symbol.
and
if
you
let
the
people
desecrate
the
flag,
you
don't
have
a
national
symbol.
i
don't
see
how
that
follows.
we
may
not
have
a
respected
national
symbol,
but
that's
a
different
argument.
now,
if
you
want
to
run
that
argument
that
we
have
the
right
to
insist
upon
respect
for
the
flag,
that's
a
different
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
why
is
that?
i
was
going
to
ask
about
the
state
flower.
[laughter]
you're
not
going
to--
--the
state
flower?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
how
do
you
pick
out
what
to
protect?
i
mean,
you
know,
if
i
had
to
pick
between
the
constitution
and
the
flag,
i
might
well
go
with
the
constitution.
i
don't
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that.
but
we
up
to
now
have
never
allowed
such
an
item
to
be
declared
a
national
symbol
and
to
be
usable
symbolically
only
in
one
direction,
which
is
essentially
what
you're
arguing.
you
can
honor
it
all
you
like,
but
you
can't
dishonor
it
as
a
sign
of
disrespect
for
the
country.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
one
hardly
desecrates
it
in
order
to
honor
it.
i
mean,
you
only
desecrate
it
in
order
to
show
your
disagreement
with
what
it
stands
for,
isn't
that
right?
so,
it
is
sort
of
a
one-way
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
its
motive...
its
motive...
his
motive
will
never
be
to
honor
the
country.
it
will
always
be
to
criticize
the
country.
justice
antonin
scalia
will
you
give
me
an
example
where
one...
somebody
desecrates
the
flag
in
order
to
show
that
he
agrees
with
the
policies
of
the
united
states.
i--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
your
statute
would
cover
that
example
that
you
just
gave?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
they
had
in
mind
then
in
drafting
the
first
amendment
that
it
should
be
a
prosecutable
offense?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
your
response
is
that
they
were
willing
to
go
to
jail,
just
as
they
were
when
they
signed
the
declaration.
they
were
hoping
they
wouldn't
get
caught.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
when
it's...
do
you
think...
when
you
have
an
equally
strong
case
for
the
flag
of
the
state
of
texas
or
the
state
flower.
do
you
think
they're
the
same
case?
well,
texas
may
be,
we'll
say.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
but
47
wouldn't
work
because
there
was
never
a
47-star
flag,
is
that...
then
you
wouldn't
reach
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
all
you
have
to
do
is
take
one
star
out
of
a...
out
of
the
flag,
ana
it's
okay.
[laughter]
that
can't
be
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
that...
so,
you're
saying
47
would
be
okay.
i
tend
to
think
that's
probably
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
you
could
have
such
a...
if
that
theory
alone
is
enough
to
support
the
statute,
i
suppose
you
could
have
such
statutes
for
stars
of
david
and
crosses
and
maybe...
i
don't
know...
salman
rushdle's
book
or
whatever,
whatever
might
incite
people
you
can...
you
can
prevent
such
desecration.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
we
say
so,
it
becomes
so.
but
it
certainly
isn't
self-evident
that...
i
never
thought
that
the
flag
i
owned
is
your
flag.
i
mean--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kunstler,
i...
i...
i
think
you're
stretching
her
argument.
i
don't
think
she
said
that.
i...
i
think
she
said
that
there
has
to
be
a
fence,
but
it
doesn't
have
to
be
the
intention
to
communicate
that
offense.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
intended
offense.
justice
antonin
scalia
if...
if
you're
doing
it
to
honor
the
flag
in
your...
in
your
crazy,
mistaken
fashion,
but
it...
but
it
would
obviously
offend
anyone
else,
then
you
would
violate
the
statute.
so,
i
think
she...
she
still
insists
that
it
be
likely
to
offend
somebody,
but
you
don't
have
to
intend
to
communicate
a
dishonor
or
offense
to
the
flag.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
was
just
on
the
court
of
appeals,
then,
mr.
kunstler.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
may
have
been
wrong,
you
know.
i
hope
that
the
elevation
doesn't
change
the
thought.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
waving
a
flag
in
the
back,
i
think.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
--exemption
one
applies
to
all
weather
flags.
