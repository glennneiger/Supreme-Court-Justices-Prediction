ms.
drew,
it's
probably
of
no
consequence,
but
is
there
anything
in
the
record
as
to
whether
this
flag
was
stolen?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument
if
he
owned
the
flag?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
isn't
the
real
way
of
opposing
this
kind
of
action
by
this
man
to
have
a
large
crowd
out
waving
other
flags
in
opposition
to
his
posture
rather
than
putting
him
in
jail?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
if
you
were
out
in
front
of
the
building
today,
there
are
pseudo-demonstrators
of
one
kind
or
another,
and
i'm
merely
saying
isn't...
wouldn't
it
be
better
policy
to
rather
than
have
a
criminal
statute
like
this
to
have
500
people
out
waving
flags
and
hooting
him
down,
so
to
speak?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
legislatures
act
the
way
they
do,
all
right,
no
question.
you
have
to
be
up
here
defending
them.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
the
supreme
court
have
a
flag?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
the
supreme
court
have
a
flag?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
then
we
come
close
to
the
skokie
cases.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that's
my
point.
