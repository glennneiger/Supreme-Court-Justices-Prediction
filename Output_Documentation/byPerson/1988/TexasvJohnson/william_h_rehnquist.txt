chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
88-155,
texas
v.
gregory
lee
johnson.
ms.
drew,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
prevention
of
breach
of
the
peace?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
the
sense
you're
arguing
a
minimal
form
of
respect
for
the
flag,
aren't
you?
not
that
you
have
to
take
your
hat
off
or
salute
when
it
goes
by.
now,
the
state
can't
require
you...
but
at
least
can
it
consist
that
you
not
destroy
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
drew.
mr.
kunstler.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr....
maybe
mr.
rahdert
would
feel
differently.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
facts
of
west...
west
virginia
versus
barnette
were
quite
different
from
this.
there
the
students
were
required
to
salute
the
flag.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
to
me
they're
quite
different.
you
could
say
that
if
you
can't
do
one,
you
can't
do
the
other.
but
it
seems
to
me
one
could
quite
easily
say
you
can't
do
one
but
you
can
do
the
other.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
was
the
holding
of
the
court
in
street?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
you
may
have
convinced
others.
[laughter]
but
take...
take,
for
example,
the
"live
free
or
die"
case.
do
you
remember
that--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--from
new
hampshire
where
we
said
you
can't...
new
hampshire
can't
require
you
to
carry
around
on
your
license
plate
the
expression
"live
free
or
die".
but
certainly
new
hampshire
could
have
presumably
prohibited...
new
hampshire
couldn't
compel
you
to
make
any
affirmative
statement
on
your
license.
they
certainly
could
have
prevented
you
from
making
some
statements
on
your
license
plate.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
court
said
no,
you...
you...
you
can't
pro...
you
can't
prohibit
that
sort
of
thing,
but
the...
the
reasoning
of
the
court
was
that
you
can't
require
someone
to
make
an
affirmation.
to
me
that's
west
virginia
versus
barnette.
but,
if
someone
applies
for
a
new
hampshire
license
plate
that
has
a
lot
of
foul
language
on
it,
very
likely
that
limited
thing
can
be
proscribed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about...
what
about
finer
against
new
york,
remember,
where
that
fellow
was
speaking
up
at
syracuse
and
said
president
truman
is
a
champagne
sipping
bum,
whereupon
they
told
him
he
had
to
stop
speaking
because
of
fear
from
the
crowd
was
going
to
attack
him?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
came
after
terminiello,
and
it
went...
it
came
out
the
other
way.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he'd
been
charged
with
a
number
of
different
offenses
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
did
the
case
finally...
what
was
he
charged
with
when
it
was
submitted
to
the
jury?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
mean
the
judge's
charge,
but
the
indictment
or
information,
what
offenses?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kunstler.
ms.
drew,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
drew.
the
case
is
submitted.
