we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
87-1160,
duquesne
light
company
v.
david
m.
barasch.
mr.
buscemi,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
one
could
read
hope
natural
gas
as
saying
that
if...
considering
all
of
your
clients'
investment
in
the
utility
business
and
if
the...
if
the
rate
of
return
allowed
on
that
investment,
even
after
having
subtracted
this
that
you
say
should
be
included
but
won't
be,
if
that
gives
them
a
reasonable
return,
that's
good
enough.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
then
that
it's
a
matter
of
constitutional
dimension.
every
time
a
public
utility
commission
refuses
to
allow
a
particular
item
as...
on
which
the
utility
claims
return.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
here
we
were
talking
about
an
expenditure
of
$50,000
or
some
much
lesser
sum,
and
it
was...
it
was
much
more
debatable
as
to
whether
this
sort
of
thing
really
should
be
included
in
the
capital
base,
i
take
it
your
position
would
still
be
that
if
you
could
show
that
it
should
have
been,
then
it's
a
constitutional
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what...
what
if
the
utility
commission
were
to
say
we
think
a
fair
rate
of
return
on
duquesne's
investment
is
7
percent,
but
we're
going
to
disallow
these
expenditures
for
nuclear
plants?
let's...
and
then
it
comes
to
this
court
and
we
say,
well,
we
don't
think
they
should
have
disallowed
it,
but
we
think
a
fair
rate
of
return
is
6
percent.
and
so,
duquesne
is
still
getting
what
it
ought
to
under
the
constitution.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
if...
what
if
the
respondent
cross-petition
said
we
think
the...
that
the
agency
is
allowing
more
than
the
constitution
requires
as
a
rate
of
return?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
the
legislature
disapproved
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
should
we
favor
the...
what
you
call
the
commission's
balancing
over
the
legislature's
balancing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
one
know
whether
the
legislature
did
any
balancing
or
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
commission
had
said
after
thinking
this
over
for
a
long
time
and
considering
the
interests
of
the
consumers
and
the
utility
and
balancing
things
as
best
we
can,
we
conclude,
and
then
they
say
exactly
what
the
legislature
said?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
the
legislature
can't
pass
a
general
statute
applicable
to
all
utilities
such
as
this?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
then
a
legislature
has
to
leave
up
to
its
utility
commission,
which
is
presumably
almost
an
agency
of
the
legislature...
it
has
to
leave
to
the
utility
decision...
commission
all
decisions
as
to
how
each
of
these
factors
is
to
be
brought
in.
it
can't
pass
a
general
legislation
that
would
bind
the
commission.
we're
saying
in
our
second
submission
with...
under
hope
that
the
entity,
whether
it
be
the
legislature
or
the
rate...
or
the
public
utility
commission
that
sets
the
rates,
must
have
the
right
to
take
everything
into
account
which
we
think
is
what
hope
says.
but
i
return
to
what
i
said
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
question,
which
is
that
our
first
submission
is
that
under
hope,
under
natural
gas
pipeline,
under
the
earlier
decisions
of
this
court
as
well,
there
has
never
been
a
suggestion
by
the
court
that
a
ratemaking
body,
whether
it
be
a
state
legislature
or
a
public
utility
commission,
can
pick
and
choose
among
ratemaking
methods
so
that
it
produces
the
result
that
it
wants
to
achieve.
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
public
utility
commission
follows,
generally
speaking,
the
original
cost-prudent
investment
method
of
fixing
rates.
but
when
it
comes
to
cancelled
plants,
as
in
this
case,
suddenly
we
have
a
situation
in
which
the
used
and
useful
rule
is
injected
into
the
equation
and
the
$50
million
worth
of
expenses
are
deleted
altogether
from
the
balance.
mr.
buscemi,
is
that...
is
that
where
the...
where
the
balancing
that
hope
referred
to
occurs?
at
each
individualized
decision,
will
this
be
included
in
the
rate
base,
will
that
be
included
in
the
rate
base?
it
seems
to
me
that
the
balancing
occurs
at
the
moment
of
truth,
when
the
state
agency,
whatever
state
agency
it
is,
determines
how
much
money
is
this
utility
entitled
to
get
from
the
ratepayers.
and
when
that
judgment
occurs,
you
can
balance.
for
all
we
know,
when
that
judgment
comes
before
the
utility
commission,
the
commission
will
say,
well,
gee,
now
that
we
have
this
used
and
useful
rule,
the
stock
of
these
utilities
are
going
to
be
a
lot
less
attractive.
we're
going
to
have
to
give
a
higher...
a
higher
return
on
equity.
therefore,
whatever
the
rate
base
is,
we're
going
to
have
to
apply
a
higher...
a
higher
rate
of
return
to
it.
now,
how
do
we
know
that
that
balancing
isn't
going
to
occur
at
that
stage?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
buscemi.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
popowsky.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
under
hope
natural
gas
a
utility
commission
could
say
to
duquesne...
the
pennsylvania
utility
commission
here...
this
has
been
a
bad
year
for
consumers
and
we
know
you've
prudently
spent
a
million
dollars
in
working
some
of
your
plants,
but
we're
just
not
going
to
allow
that
to
you
this
year
because
the
consumers
can't
afford
it?
and
so,
you
take...
you
claim
it
as
a
constitutional
violation.
and
the
commission
says,
well,
look,
their
overall
base
is...
figuring
on
the
rate
of
return
is
perfectly
okay.
the
fact
that
there
are
these
individual
disallowances
doesn't
make
any
difference
even
if
they're
for
totally
unacceptable
reasons.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no
matter
how
bizarre
some
of
the
reasoning
of
the
commission
may
be
as
to
why
it
was
disallowing
expenses
or
items
in
the
rate...
rate
base?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
say
that
would
open
to
review
a
claim
by
the
utility
here
that
the
commission
had
been
arbitrary
in
switching
from
prudently
invested
to
use...
used
and
useful?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what...
what
if
the
utility
could
show
that
in
every
case
where
it
benefited
the
consumer
the
state...
the
commission
had
adopted
one
method
and
in...
and
in
every
case
where
it
might
have
benefited
the
utility
that
it
adopted
another
so
that...
you
know,
it
ruled
against
the
utility
on
every
single
claim
it
made
whether
it
was
used
or
useful
or
prudently
invested?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
popowsky.
mr.
buscemi,
you
have
two
minutes
left.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
buscemi.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
number
87-1160,
duquesne
light
company
against
barasch.
duquesne
light
company
and
its
co-petitioner,
pennsylvania
power
company,
are
two
utilities
that
provide
electrical
service
in
western
pennsylvania.
in
1967,
they
joined
a
venture
to
construct
seven
nuclear-generating
units.
intervening
events
such
as
the
arab
oil
embargo
and
the
accident
at
three
mile
island,
however,
forced
them
to
cancel
plans
for
construction
of
four
of
these
plants.
the
utilities
attempted
to
cover
their
expenditures
for
the
preliminary
work
looking
to
build
the
plants
through
an
increase
in
electrical
rates
to
customers.
the
pennsylvania
utilities
commission
allowed
the
increase,
but
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
reversed
that
decision.
it
read
a
recently
enacted
pennsylvania
statute
as
disallowing
any
charge
in
the
rates
for
construction
of
generating
facilities
which
were
not
used
and
useful
in
service
to
the
public.
we
hold
that
nothing
in
the
united
states
constitution
requires
that
a
utility
necessarily
be
allowed
to
recover
this
sort
of
expenditures
which
duquesne
sought
to
recover
here.
the
utilities
have
not
suggested
that
the
rates
they
will
be
allowed
are
insufficient
to
compensate
them
for
the
cost
of
their
capital
on
the
risk
on
their
business.
that
the
act
may
be
theoretically
inconsistent
with
the
balance
of
pennsylvania's
rate
making
approaches
of
no
importance
so
long
as
the
overall
rate
is
fair.
we,
therefore,
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
white
and
justice
o'connor
have
joined.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissent.
