justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you?
it
might
oversimplify.
you're
claiming
i
gather
there's
a
constitutional
right
to
recover
all
prudently
incurred
expenses.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
doesn't
it
boil
down
to
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
does...
does
your
contention
boil
down
to
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but...
and
that
it's
not
consistent
if
you
exclude
a
category
of
prudently
incurred
costs.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
it
must
include
all
prudently
incurred--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
not
they
should.
the
constitution
compels
them
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
would
mean
under
that
view
that
the
issue
of
whether
these
costs
were
prudently
incurred,
if
that
were
to
be
debated,
would
be
a
federal
constitutional
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
would
in
every
case.
it
would
in
every
case
it
seems
to
me.
i
don't
understand
how...
unless
you
just
say
it
has
got
to
be
at
least
$50
million.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and...
and
the
issue
would
be
the
same
if
it...
here,
of
course,
it's
stipulated
they're
prudent.
but,
you
know,
other
cases
it
might
not
be.
