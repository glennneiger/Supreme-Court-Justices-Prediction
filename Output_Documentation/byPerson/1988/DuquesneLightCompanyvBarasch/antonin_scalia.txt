justice
antonin
scalia
you...
you're
not
interested
in
recovering
expenses.
you're...
you're...
you're
interested
in
getting
enough
money
to
run
a...
a
profitable
business
whether
it's
done
by
computing
your
expenses
and
then
giving
you
enough
over
that
to
do
so
or
whether
it's
done
in
some
other
manner.
what
do
you
care
whether
they
allow
you
the
return
on
this
nuclear
plant
so
long
as
you
have
a
high
enough
rate
of
return?
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
what
if
the
state,
in
light
of
the
fact
that
they
have
now
exposed
you
to
a...
a
greater
risk
than
in
the
past...
that
is,
you...
you
have
to
build
these
plants
and
you
can't
get...
get
that
thrown
into
your
rate
base
unless
they're
used
and
useful.
what
if
the
state
says
in
light
of
that
added
risk,
we're
going
to
kick
up
your
rate
of
return
from
18
to
25
percent?
would
you
have
been
harmed
at
all?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
hypothetical
i
gave
you
does
not
include
the
cost
of
the
plant
in
the
rates
charged
at
all.
it
just
gives
you
higher...
higher
return
in
light
of
the
fact
that
you
are
now
undergoing
a
higher
risk.
that
is
the
risk
of
not
being
able
to
get
that
included
in...
in
your
rate
base
if
it
turns
out
not
to
be
used
and
useful.
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
a
very
broad
reading
of
that
language.
maybe...
maybe
it
means
that.
i
wouldn't...
i
wouldn't
take
it
to
mean
that
automatically.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
buscemi,
it's
nice
of
you
to
not
ask
for
it,
but...
but...
but
really,
we
shouldn't
kid
ourselves.
if
you're
right
that
you're
entitled
to...
to
return
of
the
capital,
you'd
also
be
entitled
under
the
constitution
to
interest
on
that
capital
while
it's
invested,
wouldn't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
going
to
get
to
the
answer
to
my
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
i...
i
just
want
to
be
sure
you
didn't
have
some...
different
constitutional
theory
that
it
would
somehow
permit
us
to...
to
require
the
state
to
provide
recovery
of
the
investment,
but
not
recovery
on
the
investment
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
know
of
any
in
particular.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
come
back
to
that
language
that
this...
there
can
be
no
return
on
this--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
that
the
language
you're
referring
to?
what
page
was
it
again?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
what
i'm
saying
will
get
reflected
in
the
rates
charged
is
not
this
particular
capital
expenditure,
but
rather
the
increased...
the
increased
profits
that
equity
investors
are
going
to
demand
in
order
to
invest
in
what
is
now
a
higher
risk
enterprise.
i
don't
see
how
that
bears
any
relationship
to
charging
the
ratepayers
for
these
particular
plants.
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
charging
the
ratepayers
for
a
higher
risk
and
therefore
necessity
to
pay
higher
return.
justice
antonin
scalia
xxx
say
i
had
a
whole
lot
of
confidence.
i
just
said
that
maybe
you
have
to
come
back
at
some
other
time
and
show
us
that
you're
not
getting
enough
of
a
rate
of
return.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
chief
justice
isn't
talking
taking.
he's
talking
due
process.
justice
antonin
scalia
wouldn't
you
argue
that
even
under
the
due
process
clause
you
wouldn't
have
to
show
a
taking,
but
you'd
still
have
to
show
a
deprivation
of...
of
property
which
would
get
you
back
ultimately
to
the
same
kind
of
inquiries
we've
been
going
through,
wouldn't
it?
wouldn't
it
ultimately
get
you
back
to
what...
what
is
the
overall
rate
of
return
even
under
the
due
process
clause?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
popowsky,
would
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--would
you
agree
if...
if
the
state
has,
in
fact...
and
i
agree
you
claim
it
hasn't,
but
if
it
has,
in
fact,
changed
from
a
prudent
investment
criterion
of
what
goes
into
the
rate
base
to
a
used
and
useful
criterion,
that
the
utilities
would
be
entitled
to
a
higher
rate
of
return
than
what
they
had
under
the
old
system?
would
you
concede
that
because
if
you
would
concede
that,
then
i
think...
then
i
think
maybe
mr.
buscemi
has
nothing
to
worry
about.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
this
is
a
greater
risk,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
your
answer
is
yes
i
think.
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
are
you
urging
that
we
do
with
this
appeal?
we...
we
should...
should
we
decide
the
case
and...
and
find
in
your
favor,
or
is
your
argument
that...
that
it's
not
ready
to
be
decided?
