mr.
irwin
a.
popowsky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
our
view,
the
question
presented
in
this
appeal
is
a
narrow
one.
that
question
is
whether
a
public
utility
has
a
constitutional
right
to
charge
ratepayers
for
the
cost
of
any
particular
investment
even
where
the
denial
of
recovery
of
that
investment
is
not
alleged
to
have
any
significant
impact
on
the
utility's
overall
rate
level
or
financial
condition.
our
proposed
response
to
that
question
and
the
framework
for
my
argument
today
is
twofold.
first,
and
most
importantly,
i
will
argue
that
the
court
should
simply
reaffirm
the
hope
natural
gas
decision
and
thereby
reject
the
utilities'
appeal
in
this
case.
hope
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
which
followed
it
have
made
it
clear
that
the
proper
focus
of
this
court's
review
is
on
the
overall
end
result
of
the
rate
order
not
upon
the
individual
components
of
that
order
and
not
upon
the
methods
used
to
arrive
at
that
result.
mr.
irwin
a.
popowsky
your
honor,
as
you
pointed
out,
this
case
has
not
been...
this
case
has
been
remanded
to
the
public
utility
commission.
mr.
irwin
a.
popowsky
the
company...
we
do
not
yet
know
what
arguments
the
company
will
make.
mr.
irwin
a.
popowsky
the
company
would
be--
mr.
irwin
a.
popowsky
--the
company
would
be--
mr.
irwin
a.
popowsky
--the
company
would
be
free
to
make
that
argument.
however,
i
would
point
out
that
what
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
held--
mr.
irwin
a.
popowsky
--your
honor,
if
the
commission
finds
that
the
risk
of
investment...
and
i'm
talking
about
the
risk
of
investment
rather
than
the
costs
of
these
investments...
is
increased,
then
in
our
view
the
commission
is
free
to
raise
the
rate
of
return
on
the
company's
overall
investment.
what
i
was
going
to
suggest,
your
honor,
is
that
the
more
appropriate
course
would
be
the
one
which
i
believe
was
indicated
in
justice
scalia's
question
which
is
what
occurred
in
the
state
of
ohio;
that
is,
if
as
a
result
of
this
alleged
change
in
the
pennsylvania
regulatory
system...
and
we
would
contend
there
has
been
no
change.
we
would
contend
that
the
used
and
useful
principle
as
held
by
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
has
long
been
in
effect
long
before
this
statute
occurred.
but
if
there
has
been
an
increase
in
the
company's
overall
risk,
then
the
company
is
certainly
free...
and
they
have
been
free
for
the
last
several
months
at
least...
to
seek
a
rate
increase
in
which
they
would
allege
that
the
rate
of
return
that
has
been
allowed
by
the
commission
is
inadequate
to
meet
their
capital
needs.
and
that,
your
honor,
is
the
difference
between
the
risk
of
loss...
i'm
sorry...
between
compensation
for
the
loss
on
these
particular
investments
and
compensation
for
risk.
our
argument--
mr.
irwin
a.
popowsky
--i
believe
the
company
on
remand
has
preserved
these
issues.
mr.
irwin
a.
popowsky
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
and
the
point
is...
and
i
think
you're
correct...
that...
that
the
hope
decision...
if
the
company
had
made
a
proper
claim
under
hope,
if
the
company
had
claimed
that
the
overall
end
result
of
this
rate
order
was
confiscatory,
then
i
would
argue
that
the
company's
arguments
are
premature.
we
can't
possibly
know
what
the
final
end
result
of
this
case
will
be
because
it's
not
over.
however,
the
company
did
not
make
that
argument.
and
what
we're
suggesting
that
the
company's
not
only...
argument
is
not
merely
premature,
it
is
simply
wrong.
the
company
is
contending
that
they
have
a...
a
constitutional
right
to
recovery
of
this
particular
investment.
and
we
suggest
that
under
the
hope
natural
gas
case
it
is
absolutely
clear
that
it
is
the...
it
is
only
if
the
end
result
of
the
rate
order
is...
is
confiscatory
that
such
a
result
can
be
reached.
mr.
irwin
a.
popowsky
to
the
extent
that
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
has
ruled
that
these
particular
expenses
may
not
be
included
in
the
rates,
yes,
the
judgment
is
final.
mr.
irwin
a.
popowsky
if
they
take
an
action
that
reflects
the
costs,
your
honor,
and
rates--
mr.
irwin
a.
popowsky
--but
if
the
commission
is
free
to
take
action
that
reflects
the
risk
of
non-recovery
of
costs.
and
for
that
matter,
the
commission
can
and
does
reflect
all
risks
that
are...
that
face
the
utility
when
it
sets
the--
mr.
irwin
a.
popowsky
--the
rate
of
return
in
every
rate
case.
and
i
believe
that
is
what
the--
mr.
irwin
a.
popowsky
--the
rate
of
return
which
is
applied
to
the
rate
base.
mr.
irwin
a.
popowsky
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
irwin
a.
popowsky
well,
your
honor,
the...
the...
the
threshold
examination
in...
under
hope...
and
as...
is
that
the
end
result
of
the
rate
order
must
satisfy
the
investor
interests
in
hope.
if
those
investor
interests
are
satisfied,
then
the
rates
are
just
and
reasonable
and
there
is
no
constitutional
violation.
mr.
irwin
a.
popowsky
your
honor,
there
would
be
no
confiscation
under
that
case
under
hope.
however,
the
utility,
as
well
as
the
ratepayers,
have
other
protections
under
the
constitution
under
the
due
process
clause.
the
ratemaking
methodology
cannot
be
totally
arbitrary.
mr.
irwin
a.
popowsky
no,
because
that's
precisely
the
type
of
ratemaking
methodologies
that
are
within
the
range
of
methodologies
that
have...
that
have
consistently
been
used.
and
hope
states
that
it
is
the...
in
reviewing
a
rate
order,
it
is
the
result
reached
not
the
methodology
employed.
mr.
irwin
a.
popowsky
under
the...
under
the
hope
standard
and
under
the...
the
takings
jurisprudence
of
this
court,
i
believe
that
there
would
not
be
a
taking
unless
there
was
an
overall
end
result
that
produced
an
unjust
and
unreasonable
result.
as
the
court
held--
mr.
irwin
a.
popowsky
--oh,
your
honor,
under
the
due
process
clause
under
procedural
due
process
and
under...
for
example,
under
the...
the
nebbia
decision,
if
the
method
used
is...
is
irrational
or
unrelated
to
any
valid
public
purpose,
then
i
would
agree
that
there
could
be
a...
a
due
process
violation.
it's
my
understanding
that
the
company
here
is
claiming
that
there
is...
that
this
particular
rate
order
is
confiscatory.
and
we
are
suggesting
that
as
the
court
held
in
ferc
v.
pennzoil
and
in...
in
the
texaco
case,
which
were
both
written
by
justice
white,
that
all
that
is
protected
against
in
a
constitutional
sense
is
that
the
rates
be
set
at
a
level
which
is
higher
than
confiscatory.
that's
as
to
the
confiscation--
mr.
irwin
a.
popowsky
--well,
we
would
argue...
it's
correct,
your
honor,
that
at
least
under
hope
and
under
the
cases
that
have
followed
it,
that
what
is
constitutionally
relevant
in
a
rate
case,
as
opposed
to
perhaps
a...
a
physical
taking
of
a
company's
property...
what's
constitutionally
relevant
in
a
rate
case
is
the
overall
rate
level
and
that
is
the
investors'
interest
in
ensuring
that
the
utility
can
operate
successfully
and
attract
necessary
capital.
mr.
irwin
a.
popowsky
i
think
that
what
the
supreme
court
did
is
consistent,
yes,
with
the...
with
the
overall
end
result;
that
is,
at
least
there
has
been
no
allegation.
our
point
here,
your
honor,
is
that
there
has
been
no
allegation
even
as
of
today
that
the
rate
order
in
this
case
will
have
any
material
adverse
impact--
mr.
irwin
a.
popowsky
--it's
correct,
your
honor.
if
you
recall,
that...
that
case
was
originally
an
appeal
brought
by
the
consumer
advocate's
office
under...
under
statutory
grounds.
the
consumer
advocate
argued
that
the...
the
allowance
was
unlawful
under
state
law
grounds.
the
companies
came
back
and
argued,
no,
we
have
a
constitutional
right
to
recover
these
prudently
incurred
expenses.
and
it's
correct.
the...
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
responded,
no,
you
don't
have
that
right
per
se.
and
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
based
that
on
the
fact
that,
in
fact,
these...
these
projects
were
not
used
and
useful.
mr.
irwin
a.
popowsky
well,
your
honor,
in...
in
that
case
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
also
cited
prior
decisions
of
the...
of
that
court,
including
the
pennsylvania
electric
case
which
came
to
this
court
and
was
dismissed.
in
that
case
the
court
did
address
the
hope
issue.
that
was
a
case
involving
the...
the
three
mile
island
incident
and
whether
a
utility
could
recover
the
costs
of
the
three
mile
island
plant.
and
in
that
case
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
did
address
the
relative
constitutional
importance
of
the
hope
investor
interests
versus
the
used
and
useful
test.
mr.
irwin
a.
popowsky
no,
your
honor,
i
think
they
correctly
responded
to
the
company's
argument
that
was
presented
to
them.
the
company
did
not
present
the
argument.
that
is,
in
the
three
mile
island
case,
the
company
clearly
presented
the...
the
hope
end
result
test
and
suggested
that
the
commission
order
in
that
case
violated
that
test.
in
this
case
the
companies
argued
essentially
that
they
have
a...
as
they've
argued
here
is
that
their
right
rests
in
that
individual
item
of
property
and
the
court
responded,
no,
to
the
extent
that
you're
arguing
that
you
have
a
right
to
recover
the
cost
of
this
property,
that
is
incorrect.
mr.
irwin
a.
popowsky
your
honor,
i
would
agree
that
they...
perhaps
the
court
didn't
need
to
reach
that
issue
if
they
had
addressed
the...
the
hope
issue
first;
that
is,
the
hope,
in
essence,
creates
a
two
part
examination.
first,
it
is
necessary
to
determine
that
the
overall
end
result
of
the
order
violates
the
investor
interest.
that's
only
the
first
part
of
the
test
in
hope.
second,
one
must
consider
whether
the
violation
or
failure
to
satisfy
those
interests
is
overcome
by
some
countervailing
public
and
ratepayer
concerns.
now,
the
used
and
useful
principle
has
traditionally
been
used
as
one
of
those
ratepayer
concerns,
and
in
certain
cases
it
may,
in
fact,
outweigh
the
investor
interests
identified
in
hope.
so,
what
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
is
that
that
is
an
issue
that
this
court
need
not
reach
because
in
this
case,
in
coming
to
this
court,
the
company
has
failed
to
make
the
necessary
threshold
argument
under
hope,
that
is,
that
the
disallowance
in
this
case
has
a--
mr.
irwin
a.
popowsky
--[inaudible]
effect
on
the
overall
rates.
mr.
irwin
a.
popowsky
your
honor,
i
would
concede
that...
that
the
proper
rate
of
return
established
for
a
public
utility
in
pennsylvania
should
reflect
all
risks
that
that
utility
incurs.
if
at
time
period
a--
mr.
irwin
a.
popowsky
--yes,
yes.
if
at
time
period
a,
the
company
is
operating
under
a
system,
which
i
don't
believe
ever
existed
in
pennsylvania...
and
our
pennsylvania
supreme
court
has
so
held,
but
if
they
operated
under
a
system
where
all
costs
that
the
company
spent
could
be
included
in
rates,
no
matter
whether
they
happen
to
produce
electricity
or
not,
if
that
was
such
a
system
and
people
invested
under
that
belief,
and
then
the
law
was
changed,
then
prospectively...
prospectively
you
would
have
to
compensate
or
you
should
compensate
investors
for
that...
for
that
higher
risk.
mr.
irwin
a.
popowsky
yes.
yes,
it
is.
mr.
irwin
a.
popowsky
your
honor,
in
the...
in
the...
certainly
in
the
second
part
of
the
hope
analysis...
that
is,
in
determining
the
relative
balance
of
investor
and
consumer
interests...
it
would...
the
nature
of
the
government
action
would
become
important
and
to
the
extent
that
by,
for
example,
ordering
a
utility
to
build
a
particular
plant
and
particularly
if
the
commission
also
indicated
at
that
time
that
we
were
operating
under
a...
a
regulatory
regime
under
which
all
of
those
costs
would
necessarily
be
included
in
rates,
then
that
company
would
have
a
stronger
claim.
but
the
basic
structure
of
the...
of
the
hope
test--
mr.
irwin
a.
popowsky
--your
honor,
initially
one
would...
the
court
should
still
examine
in
our
view
the...
the
hope
end
result
test
or
as
was
held
in
the
ferc
v.
pennzoil
case,
all--
mr.
irwin
a.
popowsky
--your
honor,
in
that
case,
it's
quite
possible
that
there
could
be
some
other
protection
to
the
utility.
for
example,
it
sounds
as
if
there
was
almost
a
contract
at
that
point
between
the...
the
state
and
the
company.
we're
very
far
from
that
in
this
case.
what
we
have
is
basically
a
passive
set
of
regulation
where
the
utility
decides
what
to
build
and
when
to
build
and
what
to
cancel
and
when
to
cancel.
and
the
role
of
the
commission
is
to...
is
to
determine
what
is
a
just
and
reasonable
rate.
if
the
rates
are
just
and
reasonable--
mr.
irwin
a.
popowsky
--certainly
not
in
this
case,
your
honor.
it
was
not
an
order
to
build.
the
utility
was
free
to...
to
take
any
steps
that
it...
that
it
chose
to...
to
meet
its...
its
future
needs.
the
genius
of
the
hope
decision
in
our
view
is
that
it
recognized
what
is
truly
at
stake
and
therefore
what
is
constitutionally
protected
in
a
utility
rate
case.
hope
recognized
that
investors
have
a
legitimate
interest
in
an
overall
rate
level
which
permits
the
utility
to
operate
successfully
and
to
attract
necessary
capital.
but
investors
have
no
constitutionally
protected
interest
in
whether
a
particular
cost
item
enters
into
the
ratemaking
equation,
nor
do
they
have
a
constitutionally
protected
interest
in
the
application
of
any
particular
ratemaking
methodology.
it
also
makes
no
difference
from
a
constitutional
perspective
whether
a
particular
rate
claim
involves
the
return
on
an
investment
or
the
recovery
of
that
investment.
all
that
is
protected
against
in
a
constitutional
sense
is
that
the
rates
fixed
by
the
commission
be
higher
than
a
confiscatory
level.
hope
held
that
if
the
overall
rate
level
cannot
be
said
to
be
unjust
and
unreasonable,
then
investors
have
no
right
to
complain
and
judicial
review
by
this
court
is
at
an
end.
unless
this
court
is
prepared
to
overrule
hope,
then
i
would
submit
that
the
companies'
appeal
in
this
case
is
at
an
end
as
well.
but
even
if
the
court
were
to
accept
the
companies'
invitation--
mr.
irwin
a.
popowsky
--your
honor,
i...
i
think
that
you
should
decide
in
our
favor
the
issues
raised
by
the
utility.
and
the
case
has
been
remanded
already,
your
honor.
the
case
was
remanded
by
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
to
the
pennsylvania
public
utility
commission.
what
we're
saying
is
that
this
order
should
be
affirmed
and
that
the
companies'
appeal
does
not...
has
not
raised
a
valid
hope
issue,
and
to
the
extent
that
it
has
attacked
a
specific
item
in
the
ratemaking
equation,
that
is
an
improper
appeal
and
should
be
rejected.
to
the
extent
that
they
challenge
section
1315
of
the
public
utility
code
on
its
face,
which
i
believe
they're
doing,
that
should
be
rejected.
there's
nothing
facially
invalid
about
a...
about
a
rule
which
restricts
utility
rate...
specific
rate
recovery
to
individual
assets.
mr.
irwin
a.
popowsky
yes,
your
honor,
to
the
extent
that
the
company
has
challenged
specific
aspects
of
that...
of
that
judgment.
the
only
thing
that
i
don't
think
is
final...
what
i'm
trying
to
suggest
is...
going
back
to
your
honor
and
justice
o'connor's
original
questions,
if
this
case
in
our
view
had
raised
the
proper
issue...
that
is,
whether
the
overall
end
result
was
unjust
and
unreasonable...
then
in
our
view
the
case
would...
that
appeal
would
be...
would
be
premature
in
a
sense
because
we
don't
know
what
the
final
end
result
is.
to
the
extent
that
the
case
challenges
section
1315
of
the
pennsylvania
public
utility
code
on
its
face,
that
challenge
should
be
rejected.
and
to
the
extent
that
it
argues
that
any
individual
item
in
any
rate
case
must
be
specifically
reflected
in
rates,
we
would
ask
that
that
be
rejected
as
well.
mr.
irwin
a.
popowsky
for
now,
your
honor.
certainly
we
don't
think
that
the...
that
the
state
supreme
court
has
done
thing
which...
which
warrants
reversal
of
this
decision.
mr.
irwin
a.
popowsky
duquesne
and
penn
power
investors
were
never
told
by
the
state
that
they
would
be
guaranteed
recovery
of
investments
which
provide
no
service
to
ratepayers.
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
ruled
in
this
case
that
the
used
and
useful
principle
was
established
as
a
matter
of
state
law...
a
matter
of
state
ratemaking
policy
long
before
the
enactment
of
the
specific
ratemaking
provision
at
issue
here.
neither
before
nor
after
hope,
has
this
court
ever
ruled
that
a
utility
has
a
constitutional
right
to
charge
ratepayers
either
a
return
on
or
a
recovery
of
non-used
and
useful
investment.
there
is,
therefore,
no
basis
upon
which
the
utilities
can
now
claim
that
their
investors
were
unaware
that
there
was
at
least
a
risk
that
non-used
and
useful
investments
would
continue
to
be
excluded
from
the
ratemaking
equation.
the
companies'
argument
would
turn
nearly
every
rate
disallowance
in
every
rate
order
into
a
constitutional
issue.
the
acceptance
of
the
companies'
argument
would
return
this
court
and
all
reviewing
courts
to
the
pre-hope
era
where
generous
rate
increases
to
financially
sound
utilities
could
be
attacked
as
confiscatory
because
of
the
failure
to
approve
a
specific
cost
item
in
a
constitutionally
proscribed
manner.
the
states
would
be
unable
to
apply
any
other
economic
or
policy
considerations
in
determining
how
to
set
just
and
reasonable
rates.
the
companies'
argument
also
fails
to
recognize
that
ratemaking
is
an
ongoing,
dynamic
process.
duquesne
light
company
has
had
five
base
rate
cases
just
during
the
pendency
of
the
appeals
in
this
case.
in
upholding
the
federal
power
commission's
order
in
the
hope
case,
the
court
recognized
that
this
is
not
an
order
for
all
time
and
that
the
doors
of
the
commission
are
open
for
increased
allowances
that
prove
to
be
necessary.
rather
than
assigning
constitutional
status
to
every
dollar
of
every
rate
claim
of
every
public
utility
in
the
united
states,
we
would
respectfully
ask
the
court
to
reaffirm
the
hope
decision
and
deny
the
companies'
appeal
in
this
case.
