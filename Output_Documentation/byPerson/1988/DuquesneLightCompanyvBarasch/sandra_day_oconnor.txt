justice
sandra
day
o'connor
counsel,
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court,
i
take
it,
remanded
this
case
to
the
pennsylvania
public
utilities
commission
for
further
proceedings.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it...
is
it
possible
that
the
pennsylvania
public
utilities
commission
could
increase
the
risk
premium
portion
of
the
equity
rate
to
reflect
the
increased
risk
on
remand?
is
there
some
way
that
your
client
could
be
compensated
in
a
different
way
on
remand?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
wasn't
altogether
clear
to
me,
and
it
was
not
clear
to
me
whether
this
then
is
a
final
judgment.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
think
it's...
it's
clearly
a
frustration
to
the
utility
company
under
the
scenario
you
paint,
but
under
the
hope
gas
case,
don't
we
look
at
the
bottom
line
to
whether
the
economic
impact
overall
can
be
characterized
as
confiscatory?
and
isn't
that
the
bottom
line?
and
how
can
we
look
at
that
bottom
line
until
we
know
what
happens
on
remand?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
the
test
under
hope
gas?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
look
at
the
overall
effect
to
see
whether
it's
confiscatory.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
popowsky,
what
is
open
to
the
utility
commission
on
remand
to
do
in
terms
of
adjusting
the
rate
of
return?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
oh,
in
your
view
can
the
utilities
commission
on
remand
adjust
the
rate
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
prudent
investors
apparently
now
are
not
going
to
be
allowed
any...
even
recovery
of
the
costs
of
prudent
investments?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can
the
utilities
commission
adjust
the
rate--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
account
for
that
risk?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
not
asking
what
the
company
can
argue.
i'm
asking
in
your
view
what
the
commission
can
do.
