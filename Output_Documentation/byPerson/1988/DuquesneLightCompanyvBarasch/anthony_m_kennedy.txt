but
the
chief
justice's
point
still
remains
that
no
matter
how
small
the
excluded
amount,
if
it
is
excluded,
you
think
there's
a
constitutional
issue.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
is
it...
has
it
foreclosed
a
higher
rate
of
return
than
you're
getting
now?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
anything
in
the
opinion
foreclose
a
higher
rate
of
return
than
you
are
getting
now?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
an
absolute
matter,
does
it
foreclose
your
getting
a
higher
rate
of
return
than
you're
getting
now?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
commission
does
not
do
that,
has
the
company...
and
the
company
comes
back
to
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
and
perhaps
ultimately
to
this
court...
has
the
company
preserved
all
of
the
arguments
that
it's
making
now
in
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
say
that
this
order
is
not
final
or
not
reviewable
or
that
there's
no
hope
violation
at
this
point,
can
the
company
come
back
after
their
rate
order
is
made
and
make
all
of
the
arguments
that
it's
making
here
today?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
wholly
consistent
with...
is
that
wholly
consistent
with
everything
that
pennsylvania's
supreme
court
said?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i
was
talking
about
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
decision.
that
made
it
very
clear
that
the
constitutional
guarantee
was
limited
to
a
fair
return
on
property
that
is
being
used.
wasn't
that
the
whole
theory
of
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
decision?
and
they
say
so
specifically
at
page
21a
of
the
appendix.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
that's
not
consistent
with
hope,
is
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
they
were
correct
in
the
cases
they
cited,
but
not
correct
in
what
they
said?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
it
seems
to
me
the
pennsylvania
court
does
more
than
just
respond
to
an
argument.
it
adopts
a
constitutional
theory
that
just
compensation
is
a
reasonable
return
on
fair
value
of
the
property
at
the
time
that
it's
being
used.
and
that
itself
is
the
kind
of
formulation
that
we
eschewed
in
hope
it
seems
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
it
make
any
difference
if
the...
if
the
company
had
been
ordered
by
the
state
commission
to
make
these
investments?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
would
it
have
a
claim
that
would
win
in
this
case
or
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
though
the
company
may
have
opposed
making
this
expenditure
at
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
the
extent
to
which
the
commission
participated
in
this
initial
decision
really
isn't
tantamount
to
an
order
to
build.
