mr.
peter
buscemi
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
duquesne
light
company
and
pennsylvania
power
company
are
regulated
public
utilities
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
they
are
obliged
by
statute
to
provide
adequate
and
reasonably
continuous
electrical
service
to
their
customers.
to
fulfill
their
statutory
duty
to
serve,
duquesne
and
penn
power
are
required
to
anticipate
and
provide
for
future
energy
needs
and
demands.
during
the
1970s,
duquesne
and
penn
power
spent
$50
million
in
planning
and
preparing
for
the
construction
of
four
nuclear
power
plants.
the
utilities
decided
to
build
these
plants
in
response
to
extreme
pressure
from
the
pennsylvania
public
utility
commission
as
well
as
regulatory
authorities
in
neighboring
states.
the
commission
believed
in
1973
when
the
decision
to
build
was
made
that
additional
generating
capacity
was
needed
to
meet
expected
demand.
accordingly,
duquesne
and
penn
power
spent
$50
million
for,
among
other
things,
architectural
and
engineering
services,
surveying,
construction
planning,
supplies,
preparation
of
licensing
applications
and
consulting
fees.
in
january
1980,
as
a
result
of
unforeseen
and
unforeseeable
changes
of
circumstances,
duquesne
and
penn
power
cancelled
the
four
nuclear
plants
and
did
not
proceed
with
the
actual
construction.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
because
the
state
has
sought
to
deny
duquesne
and
penn
power
any
opportunity
at
all
to
recover
any
portion
whatever
of
the
$50
million
the
utilities
spent
in
planning
for
and
preparing
to
build
the
four
cancelled
plants.
mr.
peter
buscemi
yes,
i
think
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
your
honor,
we've
obviously
thought
about
that,
and
i'd
like
to
be
able
to
say
that
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes.
but
i
honestly
think
that
under
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
and
under
its
reading
of
the
statute,
section
1315
of
the
pennsylvania
public
utilities
code,
we
would
not
succeed
in
that
effort
on
remand.
indeed,
i
suspect
that
my
adversary
here,
the
consumer
advocate,
would
say
that
that
is
just
a
way
of
accomplishing
in
one
manner
what
cannot
be
accomplished
in
another,
and
that
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
has
said
on
page
14a
of
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement
this
shall
not
be
done
in
any
way
whatsoever.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--i
think
we
do
have
a
final
judgment,
your
honor,
on
the
point
of
whether
any
portion
of
this
$50
million
of
expenses
will
be
recovered
in
any
way
whatsoever.
i
can't
imagine
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
using
stronger
language
than
it
has
used
in
its
opinion.
mr.
peter
buscemi
oh,
i
think
that's
quite
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
buscemi
in
theory
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no.
but
as
the
statute
that's
at
issue
here,
section
1315
of
the
pennsylvania
public
utilities
code,
has
been
interpreted
by
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania,
that
can't
happen
because
the
statute,
the
critical
statutory
language,
which
appears
on
page
24l
of
the...
of
the
appendix
says
"nor
otherwise
included
in
the
rates
charged.
"
and
that
is
precisely
the
language
on
which
our
opponents
relied
in
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
to
say
that
there
was
absolutely
nothing
that
could
be
done.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
inescapable
that
if
you
accept
the
proposition
that
you
are
suggesting,
the
$50
million,
the
prudent
expenses
that
were
incurred
by
duquesne
and
penn
power,
would
be
in
some
way,
whether
you
call
it
directly
or
indirectly,
included
in
the
rates
charged
because
there
would
be
a
recovery
of
the
sums
that
were
expended.
and
that's--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--your
hypothetical
that
you--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--well,
your
honor,
we've
been
confronted
in
this
case
with
a
very
broad
reading
of
the
statutory
language.
as
you
know,
the
public
utility
commission
of
pennsylvania
granted
10-year
amortization
of
the
$50
million
in
expenses
that
are
at
issue
here.
and
that
ruling,
which
appears
in
appendices
c
and
e
of
the
appendix,
was
sustained
by
the
commonwealth
court
of
pennsylvania,
both
of
whom
interpreted
the
statute
not
to
apply
to
a
situation
involving
cancelled
plants,
but
merely
to
be
a
timing
measure
with
respect
to
the
time
of
recovering
the
cost
of
construction
work
in
progress.
both
the
commission
and
the
commonwealth
court
said
that
the
statute
was
only
designed
to
make
certain
that
the
commission
understood
that
its
pre-existing
practice
was
not
to
be
changed
and
that
with
respect
to
plants
not
yet
on-line,
construction
work
in
progress
was
not
to
be
included
in
rates
in
any
way
until
such
time
as
the
plants
went
into
service.
but
both
the
commission
and
the
commonwealth
court
thought
that
the
statute
did
not
apply
to
the
cancelled
plant
situation
or
to
the
plant
taken
out
of
service
before
the
costs
incurred
in
building
that
plant
had
been
completely
recovered.
both
of
those
things
they
said
were
not
covered
by
the
statute.
but
our
opponents
disagreed
and
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
disagreed
and
said
i
believe
in
no
uncertain
terms
that
these
expenses
were
simply
out
of
the
equation,
not
to
be
considered,
not
to
be
recovered,
to
be
treated
as
if
they
had
not
been
made.
and
that
is
what
brings
us
to
this
court
today
because
there
are
several
key
facts
about
this
dispute...
about
this
case
that,
i
should
say,
are
not
disputed
at
all.
it's
common
ground
that
the
utilities'
decision
to
begin
work
on
these
four
plants
was
a
prudent
one.
it's
also
accepted
that
the
$50
million
of
expenses
were
prudently
incurred.
there's
no
controversy
about
the
amount
of
money
that
was
actually
spent.
finally,
everyone
agrees
that
the
decisions
by
the
utilities
in
january
1980
to
cancel
the
plants
was
prudent
under
all
the
circumstances
then
prevailing.
so,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
at
every
step
along
the
way,
the
utilities
did
just
what
prudent,
well-managed
utilities
were
supposed
to
do.
they
behaved
just
the
way
the
commission
wanted
them
to
behave
and
they
invested
their
capital
not
for
some
frivolous
purpose,
but
for
the
purpose
of
providing
the
electric
service
to
their
customers
that
they
must
provide
under
pennsylvania
law.
these
expenses
that
we're
arguing
about
today
were
not
wasted
in
any
real
sense.
the
money
had
to
be
spent
to
put
the
utilities
in
the
position
to
go
forward
with
construction
if
the
conditions
warranted
it.
mr.
peter
buscemi
your
honor,
i
think
the
one
thing
that
we
do
know
about
what
happens
on
remand--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--well,
under
hope
gas,
there's
no
question
that
the--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--the
supreme
court
in
that
case
used
the
phrase
"end
result",
a
phrase
that
has
been
much
used
by
our
opponents.
and
the
rate
order
as
a
whole
must
be
looked
to
to
see
whether
it's
"confiscatory".
of
course,
that
begs
the
question
of
what
it
means
for
a
rate
order
to
be
confiscatory.
the
first...
mr.
justice
harlan
back
in
smyth
v.
ames
said
that
the
question
of
how
you
determine
whether
a
rate
order
is
confiscatory
and
the
necessary
elements
in
that
inquiry
will
always
be
what
he
called
an
embarrassing
question.
well,
it
remains
an
embarrassing
question
today
because
it
is
not
easy
to
know
how
one
tells
whether
a
rate
order
is
or
is
not
confiscatory.
in
our
view,
this
rate
order
is
confiscatory
within
the
meaning
of
hope
natural
gas
simply
because
$50
million
worth
of
prudently
incurred
expenses,
expenses
incurred
for
the
sole
purpose
of
providing
electric
service,
have
been
ignored,
and
on
remand,
they
must
continue
to
be
ignored.
mr.
peter
buscemi
your
honor,
i
agree
that
hope
can
be
read
that
way,
but
the
simple
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
pennsylvania
public
utility
commission,
in
setting
the
rate
of
return
to
be
permitted
on
duquesne
and
penn
power's
debt,
preferred
stock
and
common
equity,
has
done
so
in
a
way
that
does
not
take
account
of
these
expenses.
they
have
fixed
a
rate
of
return
that
they
believe
is
a
lowest
reasonable
rate
of
return
wholly
apart
from
these
expenses.
so,
we
know
on
the
basis
of
what
has
happened
in
this
case
that
these
expenses
have
not
been
taken
into
account
in
setting
that
rate
of
return.
mr.
peter
buscemi
we're
saying,
your
honor,
that
there
is
a
constitutional
component
of
utility
rate
orders,
absolutely,
that
expenses
incurred
for
the
purpose
of
providing
electric
service
are...
can
rise
to
the
level
of
a
constitutional--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--well,
first
of
all,
in
this...
just
to
make
sure
that
we
have
the
facts
right,
there's
no
question
here
about
including
this...
these
expenditures
in
rate
base.
this
is
purely
a
question
of
recovery
of
expenses,
cash
operating
expenses
or
other
expenses
that
were
used
for
electric
service.
it's
not
a
question
of
the
rate
base
on
which
your
return
should
be
earned,
at
least
as
the
case
comes
to
this
court
today.
but,
yes,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
the
specific
amount
of
the
expense
determines
whether
or
not
the
constitution
does
or
does
not
apply.
it
may
have
lots
of
other
practical
significance.
it
may
determine
whether
or
not
the
utilities
think
the
matter
is
sufficiently
important
to
pursue,
of
course.
but
as
far
as--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--well,
i
think
in
that...
in
that
event,
your
honor,
if
the
case
were
to
come
to
the
court
in
that
posture,
i
don't
think
the
court
would
be
likely
to
review
the
agency's
decision
with
respect
to
its
conclusion
on
rate
of
return
because
that
matter
simply
wouldn't
be
before
the
court--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--as
it's
not
here.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
as
the...
the
constitution,
as
this
court's
decisions
in
natural
gas
pipeline
and
other
cases
make
clear,
does
not
fix
a
specific
rate
of
return.
it
says
that
a
rate
of
return
may
not
be
confiscatory
on
the
low
end
and
it
may
not
be
so
high
as
to
completely
overwhelm
the
consumers'
interest
on
the
other
hand
so
that
there
is
a
range.
and
i
think
it's
generally
accepted
that
public
utility
commissions,
particularly
in
this
era
of
increasing
costs,
have
attempted
to
fix
utility
rates
at
the
lowest
reasonable
rate,
which
is
the
minimum
rate
that
the
commission
believes
is
necessary
to
satisfy
constitutional
standards.
so,
i
think
that's
what's...
that's
what's
going
on.
and
i
think
that
with
respect
to
these
costs,
we're
not
in
the
rate
of
return
issue
at
all
because
here
we're
only
talking
about
the
amortization
of
the
$50
million
in
expenses,
not
the
question
of
whether
a
return
can
be
earned
on
the
unamortized
balance.
that
has
not
been
litigated
in
this
case.
mr.
peter
buscemi
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
anything
turns
under
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
on
the
amount
of
property
that
has
been
taken.
i
think
very
small
takings
of
property
can
rise
to
a
constitutional
level
in...
in
the
proper
circumstances.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
your
honor,
we
come
here
this
morning
with
two
basic
submissions.
the
first
is
that
the
constitution
requires
a
consistent
neutral
adherence
to
one
method
of
fixing
rates.
mr.
peter
buscemi
yes,
your
honor.
and
the
reason
that
that's
relevant
is
because
i
think
under
that
submission
whether
the
public
utility
commission
chooses
the
so-called
prudent
investment
route
or
the...
some
version
of
the
so-called
fair
value
method,
it
should
permit
a
return
of
prudent
costs
and
a
recovery...
and
a
return
on
the
unrecovered
costs.
and
i
think
that
that
is
inescapable
under
any
consistent
method
of
regulating
utility
rates.
mr.
peter
buscemi
now,
the
second--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--well,
the
second
submission,
which
i
was
just
about
to
describe,
really
follows
the
line
that
justice
o'connor
suggested
a
moment
ago
and
relies
on
hope
natural
gas
and
the
end
result
principle.
now,
in
hope
natural
gas,
it
talks
about
balancing
investor
and
consumer
interests.
it
provides
very
little
guidance
for
how
that
balancing
is
to
be
done.
it
doesn't
address
the
question
that
i
mentioned
in
our
first
submission,
namely,
that
there
should
be
a
consistent,
neutral
method
of
ratemaking.
it
simply
says
balance
and
look
at
the
end
result.
well,
if...
if
that's
all
that
the
constitution
tells
us,
if
that's
the
entirety
of
it,
which
we
don't
think
it
is,
but
assuming
it
is,
and
if
all
you
have
is
that
injunction
in
hope
to
balance,
then
our
submission
is
in
this
case
that
balancing
didn't
occur
because
the
$50
million
in
expenses
were
simply
removed
from
the
equation.
there
was
no
opportunity
for
anybody
to
balance
them.
indeed,
we
know
what
happened
when
the
commission
did
balance
them.
the
commission
balanced...
the
administrative
law
judge
who
first
looked
at
this
balanced,
and
he
said
in
appendix
h
of
the...
to
the
jurisdictional
statement
i
think
on
balance,
when
i
balance
the
investor
and
consumer
interests,
you
ought
to
get
your
money
back
over
a
10-year
period,
obviously,
already
less
than
the
current
value
of
the
money
or
the
value
of
the
money
when
it
was
invested.
i
think
you
ought
to
amortize
your
investment
over
a
10-year
period
and
get
it
back,
but
i
don't
think
you
ought
to
get
any
return
on
the
unamortized
balance.
that's
what
he
said,
and
the
commission
approved
that
when
they
did
the
balancing.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania,
in
interpreting
a
statute
that
was
enacted
by
the
legislature
between
the
time
of
the
administrative
law
judge's
decision
and
the
time
of
the
public
utility
commission's
decision,
decided
that
the
legislature
had
meant
not
to
permit
this
sort
of
thing.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
doubtful
whether
the
legislature
did
any
balancing
here
at
all.
that's
why
we
are
challenging
this
statute
because
we
think
that
the--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--well,
i
think
when
you
look
at
the
statute,
your
honor,
it
simply
says
that
this
sort
of
expense...
that
is,
expense
incurred
in
building
an
electric
generating
plant...
may
not
be
included
in
the
rates
charged
in
any
way
until
the
plant
is
in
service.
now,
when
that's
applied
to
a
cancelled
plant
as
in...
in
this
case,
it
means
that
there
is
no
balancing.
it
means
that
there's--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--well,
your
honor,
the
fact
is
that
that...
the
legislature
was
not
doing
that.
i
mean,
the
legislature
was
not
looking
at
the
rate
order
of
duquesne
light
company
and
pennsylvania
power
company,
the
tariffs
that
were
filed
by
those
companies,
and
reviewing
them.
that's
not
what
the
legislature
was
doing
or
purported
to
be
doing.
mr.
peter
buscemi
your
honor,
all
we're
saying
is
that
under
the
second
submission
that
i
was
making
with
regard
to
the
hope
natural
gas
balancing
test
that
if
all
the
constitution
requires
is
that
everything
be
balanced
in
one
proceeding,
then
that's
not
what
happened
here.
it
didn't
happen
here
because
the
pennsylvania
legislature
removed
one
important
item
from
the
balance,
namely,
these
expenditures.
and
that's
what
we
don't
think
hope
permits
it
to
do.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
with
all
respect,
your
honor,
i
think
we
know
it
because
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
has
told
us
that
it
will
not
occur
and
it
may
not
occur
under
the
state
law
of
pennsylvania.
mr.
peter
buscemi
your
honor--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--well,
there
are...
there...
the
statutory
language
appears
on
page
24l,
and
the
language
of
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
in
interpreting
it
appears
on
page
14a.
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
says
section
1315
"clearly
conveys
but
one
meaning:
that
the
cost
of
uncompleted
projects
shall
not
only
be
excluded
from
the
rate
base,
but
shall
not,
in
any
way
whatsoever,
be
included
in
the
rates
charged.
"
well,
the
only
way
that
the
utility
obtains
revenue
is
in
the
rates
that
it
charges,
and
the
rates
that
it
charges
must
be
the
rates
approved
by
the
public
utility
commission.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
your
honor--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--your
honor,
i
wish
i
could
say
that
i
share
your
confidence
in
what
the
pennsylvania
public
utility
commission--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--well,
i
think
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
in
its
decision
interpreting
this
statute
has
directed
the
public
utility
commission
not
to
build
these
expenses
in
in
any
way,
shape
or
form,
not
to
build
them
in
in
a
higher
rate
of
return,
not
to
build
them
in
through
amortization,
not
to
consider
them,
to
act
as
if
they
hadn't
been
spent.
mr.
peter
buscemi
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
peter
buscemi
if
it's
based
on...
on
these
expenditures
in
any
way--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--i
think
it
does.
mr.
peter
buscemi
the
issue
of
the
rate
of
return
was
not
addressed
in
the
opinion,
your
honor.
it
was
not
part
of
what
the
consumer
advocate
appealed.
the
consumer
advocate
didn't
appeal
anything
about
rate
of
return.
the
consumer
advocate
appealed
the
recovery
of
$50
million
in
expenses
through
amortization
as
an
expense
wholly
apart
from
rate
of
return.
rate
of
return
is
calculated
on
the
rate
base,
and
these
expenses
were
never
included
in
the
rate
base.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
your
honor,
i
didn't
say
that
although
i
think--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--well,
i
think
that
that
would
be
an
acceptable
way
of
resolving
this
case.
mr.
peter
buscemi
no,
your
honor.
i
think
we
say
that
there
must
be
a
consistent,
neutral
way
of
doing--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--if
you...
if
with
respect
to
the
remainder
of
the
investment
you
proceed
on
the
prudent
investment
basis,
yes.
if
the
public
utility
commission,
as
it
has
in
pennsylvania,
decides
to
use
an
original
cost-prudent
investment
method
for
determining
what's
included
in
the
rate
base
and
how
to
calculate
rate
of
return--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--they
should
do
it
across
the
board
and
not--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
i
think
it...
it
could
rise
to
that
level
yes.
but--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--no,
no.
it
does
not
depend
on
the
amount
of
the
expenses.
i
don't
turn
from
that
at
all.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
that's
true,
your
honor.
i
can't
deny
that.
there's
no
question
that
in
other
cases
the
issue
of
prudence
may
be
debated.
it's
not
here.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
please.
thank
you.
mr.
peter
buscemi
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
my
adversary
has
concentrated
a
lot
on
a
individual
item
and
says
that
our
claim
is
a
claim
for
an
individual
item
of
investment.
our
claim
is
a
claim
for
a
constitutional
method
of
setting
rates.
if
pennsylvania...
and
my
opponent
has
not
denied
it...
fixes
rates
of
return
based
on
prudent
investment
and
a
reasonable
rate
of
return,
the
lowest
reasonable
rate
based
on
the
original
cost-prudent
investment
method,
which
is
what
pennsylvania
does
under
section
1311
of
the
public
utility
code,
then
pennsylvania
must
under
the
constitution
under
the
fifth
and
the
fourteenth
amendments
permit
the
recovery
of
prudent
expenses
incurred
for
the
provision
of
electric
service.
if
pennsylvania
follows
the
fair
value
method,
which
is
what
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
suggests,
justice
kennedy,
on
page
21a
of
the
opinion,
but
which
seems
to
fly
in
the
face
of
what
the
commission
actually
does
and
what
section
1311
says,
then
the
value
of
the
used
and
useful
plants
and
the
rate
of
return
on
those
plants
can
be
adjusted
to
take
into
account
expenses
prudently
incurred
but
not
producing
electricity.
that
is
not
what
happens
in
pennsylvania.
that's
not
what
happened
in
this
case,
and
that's
why
we're
here
complaining
because
the
$50
million
that
penn
power
and
duquesne
light
spent
will
never
be
recovered.
we
will
never
be
able
to
recover
on
a
mustang
the
losses
that
we've
incurred
on
an
edsel.
that
is
the
problem
that
we
are
bringing
to
the
court's
attention
because
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
has
specifically
ruled
that
section
1315
precludes
that
kind
of
counterbalancing
that
normally
would
occur
under
the
fair
value
regime
that
was
originally
envisioned
by
this
court
in
smyth
v.
ames.
that's
not
what
pennsylvania
does.
if
the
$50
million...
and
you
did
not
hear
my
opponent
say
that
the
rate
of
return
could
be
increased
to
take
account
of
these
costs.
that's
contrary
to
his
position,
and
it's
contrary
to
the
position
that
he
would
espouse
on
remand.
thank
you.
