mr.
robert
s.
spear
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
was
initiated
by
mr.
williams,
a
prisoner
at
the
indiana
state
reformatory,
a
maximum
security
institution,
tendering
the
complaint
for
filing
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
indiana.
this
complaint
was
tendered
pro
se
and
pursuant
to
28
u.s.
code,
section
1915
as
a
pauper's
petition.
it
was
a
42
u.s.
code,
section
1983
action.
there
were
five
defendants.
the
complaint
alleged
violations
of
the
eighth
amendment
and
also
due
process
violations.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
entire
case
as
frivolous,
pursuant
to
section
1915(d).
thereafter,
the
district
court
allowed
on
amendment
and
again
dismissed
the
case.
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed
this
dismissal
as
to
three
of
the
defendants
under
both
theories,
and
also
as
to
the
remaining
two
defendants
under
the
due
process
theory,
but
revived
the
action
as
to
the
eighth
amendment
against
mr.
neitzke,
the
hospital
administrator,
and
dr.
chol,
the
medical
director.
in
establishing
this
case,
the
seventh
circuit
set
forth
the
following
standard:
"a
frivolous
complaint
is
one
in
which
the
petitioner
can
make
no
rational
argument
in
law
or
facts
to
support
his
or
her
claim
for
relief.
"
and
in
making
this
holding,
the
court
relied
on
the
d.c.
circuit
case
of
brandon
v.
district
of
columbia
board
of
parole.
the
seventh
circuit,
therefore,
clearly
held
that
28
u.s.
code,
section
1915
(d)
is
not
synonymous
with
the
test
under
12(b)(6).
the
court
specifically
agreed
with
the
district
court
that
the
eighth
amendment
allegations
in
this
case
failed
to
demonstrate
the
level
of
indifference
necessary
to
survive
the
12(b)
motion
under
estelle
v.
gamble
but
nevertheless
held
that
the
case
should
be
filed.
it
is
the
petitioners'
contention
in
this
case
that
a
complaint
which
fails
to
state
a
claim
upon
which
relief
can
be
granted
is
frivolous
within
the
meaning
of
28
u.s.
code,
section
1915(d).
section
1915
allows
access
to
the
federal
courts
for
the
poor,
as
set
forth
in
decision
of
this
court
in
adkins
v.
dupont.
there
is
an
already
established
standard
for
12(b)(6)
for
pro
se
complaints
which
is,
when
it
appears
beyond
doubt
that
the
plaintiff
can
prove
no
set
of
facts
in
support
of
his
claim
which
would
entitle
him
to
relief.
this
court
set
forth
this
standard
in
conley,
reaffirmed
it
in
halnes,
and
indeed
in
estelle
v.
gamble.
it's
petitioners'
contention
that
this
standard
is
low
enough.
the
issues
in
this
case
deal
with
how
the
district
courts
should
handle
the
congressional
mandate
of
section
1915(d)
not
to
permit
frivolous
or
malicious
complaints
under
pauper's
petitions.
we
are
not
addressing
here
the
variety
of
methodology
by
which
various
circuit
courts
have
tried
to
handle
this
problem.
we
are
talking
about
the
lowest
permissible
standard
as
opposed
to
another
standard
that
may
be
established
in
a
different
circuit.
it
is
petitioners'
contention
that
a
complaint
which
does
not
meet
the
pro
se
test
for
a
12(b)(6)
motion
is
a
minimum
beneath
which
no
complaint
should
be
allowed
to
be
filed.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
yes,
your
honor.
the
petitioners
in
this
case
would
submit
that
instead
a
test
should
be
establishing
using
12(b)(6)
as
the
standard
beneath
which
the
legal
sufficiency
of
the
complaint
should
not
be
allowed
to
go
for
purposes
of
section
1915(b).
mr.
robert
s.
spear
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not.
but
it
is
a
showing
under
rule
11
that
you
must
show,
in
order
to
avoid
this
sanction
as
a
plaintiff,
that
you
have
a
basis
in
fact
and
in
law.
if
you
do
not
have
a
basis
in
law,
rule
11
sanctions
would
apply
in
a
situation
where
the
standard
was
not
closed,
but
not...
would
only
apply...
would
not
apply
in
those
rare
cases
where
it
is
not
clear-cut
whether
or
not
the
complaint
fails
to
state
a
claim.
in
short,
although
many
cases,
perhaps
most
that
reach
this
court,
there
is
a
serious
question
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
legality.
at
the
district
court
level,
the
vast
majority
of
complaints
are
fairly
readily
apparent
whether
they
meet
the
12(b)(6)
standard.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
we'd
submit,
however--
mr.
robert
s.
spear
--apparently
it
does,
your
honor.
we
note
in
our
brief
that
several
circuits,
specifically
in
at
least
one
instance
in
the
second,
and
the
eleventh
and
the
fifth
and
the
fourth,
rather
frequently
do
this.
now,
we
are
not
suggesting--
mr.
robert
s.
spear
--yes,
your
honor,
we
believe
they
have
that
power...
in
fact,
do
so
right
now.
that
is
not,
however,
the
case
that
is
in
front
of
the
court
today
and
we'd
also
point
out,
your
honor,
that
probably
when
it
talks
about
frivolous--
mr.
robert
s.
spear
--the
face
of
the
complaint,
your
honor.
and
we
are
only
dealing
with
with
the
legal
sufficiency
here
under
a
frivolous
test.
normally
one
would
suspect
that
since
the
language
of
the
statute
isn't
disjunctive
of
frivolous
or
malicious...
malicious
may
very
well
tend
to
be
factual.
for
instance,
if
a
party
were
to
bring
a
hundred
lawsuits
within
a
period
of
a
few
weeks
or
multiple
lawsuits
against
the
same
person
for
the
same
facts,
that
would
tend
to
fall
under
the
malicious
side
of
the
test.
that's
not
what
we
have
here.
this
is
on
the
frivolous
side
of
the
test,
and
in
front
of
us
we
have
a
pure
legal
test.
we
would
submit
further
that
the
rule
11
standard,
which
has
been
proposed
by
the
respondent
in
this
case,
is
particularly
inappropriate
for
use
in
this
context.
rule
11
is
used
by
the
district
courts
as
a
sanction
and
a
deterrent
to
paying
plaintiffs
and
to
their
lawyers
for
filing
complaints
which
are
either
not
based
correctly
in
the
law
or
not
based
correctly
factually.
they
have
to
meet
both
tests.
it
is
not
appropriate
to
use
such
a
standard
for
plaintiffs
who
on
their
face
cannot
be
deterred
or,
or
punished
in
any
fashion
for
bringing
a
frivolous
complaint
when
they
have,
on
their
face,
tendered
a
proper
pauper's
petition
and
literally
have
no
assets
upon
which
to
levy.
the
test
that
we
are
attempting
to
have
this
court
establish,
although
it
has
not
reached
this
court
yet,
has
already
been
established
in
our
opinion
in
eight
of
the
circuits,
and
only
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
d.c.
circuit
have
found
that
a
complaint
can
go
lower
than
a
12(b)(6)
motion
standard
and
still
survive
in
some
viable
fashion.
the
test,
in
fact,
is
broader
in
both
the
eleventh
circuit
and,
at
least
in
one
case,
in
the
second.
we
are
not
contending
that
here
today
because
it
has
not
simply
reached
this
basis
in
this
case.
the
standard
method
in
the
southern
district
of
indiana
and
the
northern
district
is
that
a
complaint
is
referred
to
a
magistrate.
the
magistrate
makes
findings
that,
in
fact,
it
states
a
claim.
he
has
the
power
to
order
a
file
and
then
process
is
served.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
your
honor,
the
magistrate
examines
the
complaint
and
if
it,
in
his
opinion,
states
a
claim,
he
has
the
power
to
order
a
file
and
process
it,
sir.
if
in
fact
in
his
opinion
it
does
not
state
a
claim,
or
is
frivolous
under
the
1915(d)
standard,
he
makes
a
recommendation
and
sends
it
to
a
district
judge.
and
the
district
judge
makes
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
the
complaint
is
filed
or
not
filed.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
no,
your
honor.
they're
not
factual
findings.
these
are
legal
findings.
and,
in
fact,
in
the
seventh
circuit
the
only
test...
there
is
no
factual
test
prior
to
filing...
the
only
test
is
the
legal
test.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
but
that
is
not
the
test
the
seventh
circuit
uses.
the
test
that
is
used
in
other
circuits
makes
those
factual
inquiries.
in...
in
an
adversarial
proceeding
in
front
of
a
magistrate
sometimes...
with
lawyers
on
both
sides.
we're
not
suggesting
that
procedure
here
today.
we...
we
have
not
reached
that
question.
we
have
a
single
issue
on
the
legal
sufficiency
at
the
single
complaint
under
the
current
standards
used
by
the
seventh
circuit.
and
we
would
submit
that
they
have
dropped
below
the
permissible
standard
for
1915(d)
in...
contrary
to
what
eight
other
circuits
have
held.
so,
there
are
multiple
ways
to
deal
with
1915(d).
we're
not
suggesting
there
are
not.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
we're
suggesting
this
is
below--
mr.
robert
s.
spear
--it
is
tendered
in
the
clerk's
office,
and
from
the
clerk's
office
it
goes
to
the
magistrate.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
and
also
pauper's
petition
about
whether
those--
mr.
robert
s.
spear
--yes,
sir.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
no,
your
honor,
although
it
is
my
understanding
that
it
is
done
very
promptly
because
from
the
time
of
tendering
by,
by
a
prisoner
case,
for
instance--
mr.
robert
s.
spear
--'til
it's
filed
is
within
days.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
your
honor,
it
is
not...
it
is
not
filed
at
that
time
and
i--
mr.
robert
s.
spear
--no,
your
honor,
there's
not.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
your
honor,
he...
he
lacks
the
authority
to
be
able
to
make
that
decision
himself.
he--
mr.
robert
s.
spear
--sends
it
to
the
judge.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
the
judge
looks...
looks
at
it,
and
assuming
the
judge
agrees
with
the
magistrate--
mr.
robert
s.
spear
--issues
effectively
legal
findings...
not
factual
findings,
but
legal
findings...
with
effect
of
a
two
or
three
page
written
opinion
if
it
is
not
going
to
be
filed,
and
sends...
that
is
filed
with
cause
number
with
the
complaint.
and--
mr.
robert
s.
spear
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
it's
given
a
number
and
sent
back
to
the
pro
se
petitioner,
a
copy
of
the
judge's
opinion.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
thirty
days,
as
it
would
be
in
any
other
appeal.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
an
order
entered
showing
that
it
is
dismissed
under
1915(d).
mr.
robert
s.
spear
so
that
at
that
point
the
case
is
actually
docketed.
from
there
it
goes
to
the
seventh
circuit.
courtesy
copies
in
the
case
of
state
defendants
in
1983
actions
are
ordinarily
sent
to
the
indiana
attorney
general's
office,
and
the
seventh
circuit
routinely
in
such
a
case,
when
it
is
docketed
there,
sends
us
notice...
or,
actually,
the
attorney
general's
office,
notice
that
such
a
case
is
now
pending
on
appeal.
so,
strangely
enough,
it
is
briefed
on
appeal
as
if
the
parties
had
already
filed
the
complaint;
1915(d)
allows
the
dismissal
of
the
complaint
either
before
or
after
filing.
but
if--
mr.
robert
s.
spear
--your
honor,
the...
that
is
a
courtesy
copy.
only
about
two-thirds
of
these
cases
deal
with,
with
the
state
of
indiana.
a
1983
action
may
very
well
deal
with
a
small
county
official--
mr.
robert
s.
spear
--and
it
also
may
deal
with
a
state
employee
who
does
not
wish
to
be
represented
by
the
attorney
general.
that's
totally
optional.
now,
they
normally
do
because
it's
free,
frankly,
your
honor.
but
they
can
have
their
own
counsel.
and
they
are
unaware...
they
are
unaware
that
the
complaint
has
ever
been
tendered.
the
rule
in
this
case
that
we
are
contending
for
is
simply
a
de
minimus
rule,
not
a
rule
that
would
change
what
we
believe
the
standard
to
be
before
the
seventh
circuit
entered
the,
the
instant
opinion.
and
we
are
again
arguing
that
spears
v.
mccotter,
harris
v.
menendez,
and
martin-trigona
v.
stewart
rules
of
the
circuits
should
be
adopted
by
this
court.
and,
again,
we've
listed
many
other
cases
in
our
brief,
as
the
standard
beneath
which
a
pro
se
tendered
complaint
cannot
proceed
under
section
1915.
that's
the
only
issue
in
front
of
the
court.
it's
the
issue
that
we
believe
the
seventh
circuit
has
violated.
in
conclusion,
your
honors,
it
is
the
position
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case
to
established
a
familiar
and
identifiable
standard
under
section
1915(d)
to
determine
when
a
pauper's
petition
should
be
dismissed
as
frivolous,
and
we
would
submit
that
that
standard
should
be
equivalent
to
the
12(b)(6)
standard.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
yes,
it
does,
your
honor.
but
it
also
gives
them
the
advantage
of
section
1915(d),
that
they
are
not...
they're
not
harassed
or,
or
subject
to
the--
mr.
robert
s.
spear
--yes,
your
honor.
that's
exactly
right.
and
for
most
defendants
it's
probably
a
privilege
to
be
deprived
of
the
right
to
be
sued.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
they
probably
don't
want
to
have
that
right.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
yes,
your
honor.
very
briefly.
the
petitioners
in
this
case
still
contend
that
the
pro
se
12(b)(6)
rules
set
out
in
estelle
v.
gamble
and
in
haines
v.
kerner
is
in
fact
the
appropriate
standard
and
is
a
low
enough
standard
to
protect
the
rights
of--
mr.
robert
s.
spear
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
yes,
your
honor,
although
i
would
submit
that
in
close
cases,
as
we
learned
from
conley,
haines
and
estelle,
in
pro
se
litigation
in
close
cases
they
are
decided
in
favor
of
the
plaintiffs.
so,
realistically
that
issue
simply
was--
mr.
robert
s.
spear
--your
honor,
i
would--
mr.
robert
s.
spear
--i
think
it
was,
your
honor,
but
i
would
submit
that
that
is
an
unusual
situation.
mr.
robert
s.
spear
because,
your
honor--
mr.
robert
s.
spear
--your
honor,
we
would
submit
that
there
the
seventh
circuit
has
adopted
a
much
lower
standard
and
an
unenforceable
standard
when
it
differed
from
the
other
circuits.
you
had
earlier
asked
the
question
about
when
the
statute
was
originally
adopted.
it
was,
in
fact,
originally
adopted
in
1892
and
recodified
in
1948
after
the
rules,
of
course,
had
been
adopted.
but
in
1892
congress
was
locking
at
a
system
where
the
courts
refused
to
cemure
a
system,
and
even
learned
lawyers
had
difficulty
stating
a
cause
of
action.
cases
would
go
back,
would
be
repled
two
or
three
times.
the
different
situation
we
have
today
with
the
modern
rules
and
with
the
standard
established
under
haines
and
under
conley,
that,
that
we
would
submit
that
in
fact
the
current
standard
of
12(b)(6)
is
in
fact,
as
interpreted
by
this
court
for
pro
se
plaintiffs,
the
equivalent
of
a
frivolous
standard
as
it
would
have
existed
in
1892.
there
is
a
practical
aspect
to
this
case.
as
the
record
shows,
the
court
had
already
gone
through
this
procedure,
and
had
to
go
through
this
procedure
under
the
seventh
circuit
no
matter
what
the
outcome
was
below.
that
is
to
say,
the
district
court
had
already
examined
the
complaint
and
weeded
out
three
of
the
defendants
and
half
the
claims
against
the
remaining
two
defendants.
and
it
would
have
to
do
that
under
1915(d)
even
if
it
had
filed
the
complaint
as
the
seventh
circuit
ordered
it
to
do.
it's
still
going
to
go
through
the
same
test.
the
magistrate
is
going
to
examine
it.
the
district
court
is
going
to
examine
it
at
that
level.
what
the
test
that's
argued
for
by
the
respondent
in
this
case,
however,
would
do
was
cause
the
same
process
to
happen
twice
because,
assuming
the
complaint
is
then
filed,
the
defendants
are
brought
into
court
and
they
are
penalized
in
effect...
they
are
sued...
they
must
defend
themselves.
at
that
point,
the
pro
se
petitioner
files
his
response
and
the
district
court
goes
through
the
same
analysis
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
case
states
a
claim.
the
identical
analysis
that
it
underwent
before
it
allowed
the
case
to
be
filed.
we
would
submit
that
that
does
not
cause
a
judicial
economy
and
it
makes
no
rational
sense
to
have
that
kind
of
a
test
when
you
have
to
do
exactly
the...
the
courts
do
exactly
the
same
thing
twice.
plus,
it
burdens
the
defendants,
plus
it
burdens
the
other
potential
plaintiffs
in
the
whole
system,
which
is
now
clogged,
to
say
the
least.
that
kind
of
a
standard
does
not
assist
the
district
court
in
following
what
congress
has
told
it
it
must
do,
and
that
is
winnow
out
these
cases,
and,
in
fact,
the
seventh
circuit
has
said
they
must
do.
we
would
continue
to
submit,
your
honors,
that
a
system
that
causes
the
same
complaint
to
be
examined
for
the
same
standard
twice
by
the
district
court
is
not
the
system
that
should
be
adopted
by
this
court.
rather,
this
court
should
adopt
the
familiar
and
identifiable
standard
of
12(b)(6)
as
instructions
for
the
district
courts
and
the
circuit
courts,
to
allow
them
to
implement
the
congressional
policy
of
section
1915(d)
in
a
way
that
they
can
define
and
get
a
handle
on.
the
questions
of
this
court
to
learned
counsel
here
show
that
in
a
specific
case
it
was
very
difficult
for
him
to
define
a
rule
that
shows
well,
yes,
it's
below
12(b)(6),
but
how
far
below
is
it
before
it
still
must
be
dismissed
because
there's
no...
any
question
of
any
of
the
parties
in
this
case
or
the
courts
that
at
some
point
1915(d)
does
kick
in
and
there
is
a
dismissal.
the
question
is
not
whether
there
is
any
standard
prior
to
filing.
the
question
is
what
is
that
standard.
and
we
would
submit
that
the
way
to
handle
that
in
a
method
that's
enforceable
by
the
courts
is
to
use
12(b)(6)
because
it
is
a
standard
that
the
lawyers,
the
courts,
the
judges
are
familiar
with.
thank
you,
your
honors.
