mr.
george
a.
rutherglen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
the
question
of
whether
the
standard
for
dismissal
of
frivolous
actions
under
section
1915(d)
is
the
same
as
the
standard
for
dismissal
for
failure
to
state
a
claim
under
rule
12(b)(6).
respondent
submits
that
it
is
not,
for
two
reasons.
first,
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
and
other
principles
of
our
adversary
system,
sharply
distinguish
between
frivolous
actions
to
warrant
the
imposition
of
sanctions
in
a
complaint
that
simply
fails
to
state
a
claim.
in
particular,
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
a
failure
to
state
a
claim
raises
a
pure
question
of
law.
this
question
of
law
may
not
be
frivolous.
petitioners
propose
that
the
district
courts
should
always
routinely
resolve
these
questions
of
law,
even
when
they
present
major
questions
of
constitutional
law,
without
the
benefit
of
an
adversary
presentation
by
either
party.
second,
the
literal
terms
of
section
1915(d),
its
legislative
history,
and
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
require
the
same
standards
of
frivolousness
to
apply
in
actions
by
litigants
as...
in
actions
by
indigents
as
in
actions
by
ordinary
litigants.
when
congress
used
the
phrase
1915(d),
it
did
not
mean
failure
to
state
a
claim.
mr.
george
a.
rutherglen
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
enacted
in
19...
in
1892.
mr.
george
a.
rutherglen
yes,
justice
scalia.
the
legislative
history
does
not
speak
to
the
content
of
the
phrase
frivolous.
the
single
most
common
use
of
the
word
frivolous
in
the
opinions
of
this
court
before
1892
concerns
the
procedure
for
dismissing
an
appeal
for
failure
to
present
a
substantial
federal
question.
and,
indeed,
the
rules
of
this
court
in
their
1878
version,
supreme
court
rule
6,
specifically
allowed
a
motion
to
affirm
on
the
ground
that
the
question
on
which
jurisdiction
depends
is
so
frivolous
as
not
to
need
further
argument.
if
congress
was
aware
of
any
standard
usage
of
the
word
frivolous,
it
was
aware
of
its
equivalence
with
failure
to
state
a
substantial
federal
question.
moreover,
that's
exactly
what
this
court
held
much
later
in
coppedge
against
united
states.
this
court
held
that
a
pauper's
appeal
could
be
dismissed
only
when
a
paying
litigant's
appeal
could
be
dismissed,
only
when
it
failed
to
state
a
substantial
federal
question.
respondent
submits
that
failure
to
state
a
substantial
federal
question
is
virtually
identical
to
the
standard
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
is
there
a
rational
basis
in
fact
and
in
law
for
the
complaint
that
the
plaintiff
has
submitted?
mr.
george
a.
rutherglen
your
honor,
there
are
numerous
decisions
of
this
court,
for
instance,
the
famous
decision
in
bell
against
hood
which
established
precisely
this
distinction.
this
court
held
in
bell
against
hood
that
the
question
whether
there
was
a
claim
directly
under
fourth
amendment
presented
a
substantial
federal
question,
even
though
the
district
court
might
on
an
adversary
presentation
dismiss
because
the
complaint
failed
to
state
a
claim
after
the
district
court
held
that
there
was
no
such
cause
of
action.
mr.
george
a.
rutherglen
i
do,
your
honor,
so
long
as
the
procedures
and
the
burdens
that
are
put
upon
the
federal
district
courts
and
that
are
put
upon
the
defendants
in
these
cases
are
clearly
set
forth.
all
we
are
seeking
today
is
the
basic
minimal
procedures
which
any
paying
litigant
gets
in
federal
court.
just
notice
of
the
supposed
defects
in
the
complaint
and
an
opportunity
to
respond
to
those
defects
before
the
complaint
is
dismissed.
moreover,
your
honor,
we
only
defend
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
was
perfectly
appropriate
for
a
dismissal
under
section
1915(d)
to
be
done
sua
sponte
if
there
was
no
rational
basis
in
law
or
fact
for
the
plaintiffs'
claims.
and,
indeed,
in
this
very
case
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
dismissal
of
almost
all
of
the
plaintiffs'
claims.
only
two
claims
were
sent
back
down
to
the
district
court.
mr.
george
a.
rutherglen
your
honor,
courts
can
sua
sponte
dismiss
under
rule
121(b)(6).
my
understanding
of
standard
federal
practice,
as
reflected
in
the
federal
rules,
is
that
ordinarily
they
don't.
mr.
george
a.
rutherglen
courts
in
some
circuits
do?
i
believe
it
is
the
exceptional
practice,
your
honor.
bear
in
mind
that
petitioners'
claim
is
not
to
do
this
in
exceptional
cases.
petitioners'
claim
is
that
as
an
ordinary
practice
in
indigent
litigation
a
complaint
will
be
dismissed
without
giving
any
notice
to
anybody.
now,
of
course,
respondent
in
this
case
cannot
complain
about
the
absence
of
notice
to
the
defendants.
but
respondent
himself
got
no
notice
until
judgment
was
entered
against
him.
we
submit
that
this
practice
is
both
contrary
to
the
ordinary
procedures
under
the
federal
rules,
deprives
the
plaintiff
of
notice
and
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
the
sufficiency
of
his
complaint
and
works
to
the
detriment
of
the
efficient
administration
of
justice
in
the
federal
system.
we
believe
that
the
federal
courts
will
do
a
better
job
in
handling
these
cases,
and
we
admit
they
pose
problems
for
the
federal
districts
courts
if
it
asks
the
defendants
simply
to
submit
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
state
a
claim
under
the
federal
rules.
mr.
george
a.
rutherglen
yes,
your
honor.
those
are
fairly
minor
administrative
expenses.
but,
bear
in
mind,
under
the
court
of
appeals'
decision,
it
is
only
when
there
is
a
close
case,
only
when
there
is
some
rational
basis
in
law
and
fact,
that
we
even
go
through
that
minimal
procedure?
mr.
george
a.
rutherglen
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
statute
virtually
requires--
mr.
george
a.
rutherglen
--that
conclusion.
mr.
george
a.
rutherglen
yes.
i
think
the
statute
requires
the
federal
district
courts
to--
mr.
george
a.
rutherglen
--that's
right,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
george
a.
rutherglen
--yes,
your
honor.
it
would
appear
to
give
discretion
to
the
district
courts.
however,
i
know
of
no
decision
in
the
lower
federal
courts
that
leaves
this
issue
entirely
to
the
unfettered
discretion
of
the
district
judges.
mr.
george
a.
rutherglen
in
cases
involving
paying
litigants.
i
thought
that
was
the
gist
of
her
question.
but
if
i
misinterpreted
it,
i
apologize.
mr.
george
a.
rutherglen
yes.
our
position
on
those
circuits,
your
honor,
is
that
their
standard
is
the
incorrect
standard
and
should
not
be
adopted
by
this
court.
instead,
we
advocate
that
the...
our
courts
of
appeals--
mr.
george
a.
rutherglen
--except
in
clear
cases.
except
in
clear
cases,
we
think
that--
mr.
george
a.
rutherglen
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
george
a.
rutherglen
--yes,
those
are
frivolous
ones.
we
submit
that
the
definition
of
a
frivolous
case,
both
for
indigent
litigants
and
for
paying
litigants,
is
that
the
complaint
is
clearly
insufficient.
mr.
george
a.
rutherglen
well,
your
honor,
the
standard
under
rule
12(b)(6)
serves
a
quite
different
purpose
than
the
standard
that
is
appropriate
under
section
1915(d)
or
under
the
standards
for
imposing
sanctions
against
paying
litigants.
the
purpose
of
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
a
failure
to
state
a
claim
under
rule
12(b)(6)
is
to
isolate
a
dispositive
issue
of
law
at
the
beginning
of
the
lawsuit
before
there
has
been
factual
investigation
and
factual
findings
by
the
district
court
and
terminate
the
proceedings
if
those
factual
investigations
are
no
longer
necessary.
if...
even
though
all
the
allegations
that
the
plaintiff
puts
in
his
complaint
are
true,
the
law
denies
the
plaintiff
relief.
now,
that's
one
purpose
served
by
rule
12(b)(6).
mr.
george
a.
rutherglen
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
george
a.
rutherglen
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
there
are
any
number
of
cases...
we
cite
them
in
our
brief...
in
which
this
court
has
decided
major
questions
of
federal
law
in
cases
that
came
up
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
a
failure
to
state
a
claim.
we
believe
that
that
standard,
which
perfectly
well
suits
that
purpose,
cannot
be
transplanted
to
do
double
duty
under
section
1915(d).
in
particular,
if
there
is
some
doubt,
and
only
when
there
is
some
doubt
about
the
sufficiency
of
the
complaint,
we
believe
that
the
minimal
procedures
required
by
the
court
of
appeals,
service
of
process
upon
the
defendants
and
an
adversary
presentation
on
the
sufficiency
of
the
complaint,
will,
first,
protect
the
rights
of
indigent
litigants,
and,
secondly,
lead
to
the
efficient
administration
of
justice.
this
case,
we
believe,
illustrates
exactly
how
these
hasty
procedures
in
the
district
court
translate
into
wasteful
procedures
overall
in
the
federal
judicial
system.
there
were
no
adversary
procedures
whatsoever
in
this
case
in
the
district
court.
we
believe
that
it
is
better
to
have
the
adversary
procedures
in
the
district
court
before
the
case
gets
to
the
court
of
appeals.
in
this
case,
because
the
district
court
did
not
serve
process
upon
the
defendant,
there
was
no
adversary
presentation
on
the
sufficiency
of
the
complaint.
it
was
only
in
court
of
appeals
that
three
federal
judges
had
to
take
the
time
to
figure
out
whether
this
complaint
stated
a
claim.
mr.
george
a.
rutherglen
your
honor,
i
don't
have
those
statistics
at
my--
mr.
george
a.
rutherglen
--my
fingertips.
but
my--
mr.
george
a.
rutherglen
--i
suspect--
mr.
george
a.
rutherglen
--my
experience
with
prison
litigation
leads
me
to
believe
that
this
case
is
typical.
most
or
all
of
the
claims
are
clearly
insufficient
in
most
complaints
drafted
by
prisoners
by
themselves.
but
i
cannot
give
you
any
numerical
indication.
i
think
the
best
evidence
of
the
burden
that
the
procedure
in
the
court
of
appeals...
the
procedure
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
would
put
on
the
district
court
is
revealed
in
this
case,
a
simple
need
to
serve
process
upon
the
defendant
and
then
a
filing
of
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
state
a
claim.
mr.
george
a.
rutherglen
there
would
be
no
need
for
argument.
the
rules,
federal
rule
12(d),
provides
that
a
hearing
must
be
held
on
any
motion
filed
under
rule
12.
but
my
understanding
is
that
hearings
are
rarely
held
in
the
district
courts
and
that
these
motions
are
often
decided
on
the
paper
record.
mr.
george
a.
rutherglen
well,
the
plaintiff
is
then
given
an
opportunity
to
file
a
brief
in
support
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
complaint.
mr.
george
a.
rutherglen
it
is
true,
your
honor,
that
the
brief
may
not
be
a
whole
lot
of
help
to
the
court,
but
with
pro
se
litigants
the
courts,
the
federal
courts,
just
must
take
them
as
they
find
them.
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
about
appointing
counsel
to
represent
these
indigent
litigants.
our
position
is
that
given
the
disabilities,
the
practical
disabilities
that
pro
se
litigants
typically
labor
under,
the
procedures
should
be
enforced
against
them
so
that
they
at
least
have
an
opportunity
to
respond
to
the
alleged
defects
in
the
complaint
before
the
judge
has
already
made
up
his
or
her
mind
and
entered
judgment
against
the
plaintiff.
that's
what
happened
in--
mr.
george
a.
rutherglen
--this
case.
mr.
george
a.
rutherglen
haines
against
kerner
is
not
enough,
your
honor,
because
it
is
a
standard
that
is
designed
to
implement
motions
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
state
a
claim.
haines
against
turner
asks
the
court
in
very
traditional
fashion
simply
to
assume
that
all
the
allegations
stated
in
the
complaint
are
true.
mr.
george
a.
rutherglen
but
it's...
your
honor,
it
nevertheless
just
says...
i
believe
the
exact
words
are
that
a
court
can
grant
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
state
a
claim
only
if
it
appears
beyond
doubt
that
the
plaintiff
can
prove
no
set
of
facts
at
trial
that
would
entitle
him
to
relief.
haines
against
kerner,
like
any
standard
for
dismissal
for
failure
to
state
a
claim,
doesn't
give
the
plaintiff
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
on
the
law.
that
is
precisely
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
was
appropriate
in
these
cases
in
which
there
was
some
question
about
the
sufficiency
of
the
complaint.
moreover,
i
believe
that
as
a
matter
of
judicial
administration
it
would
only
confuse
the
lower
federal
courts
if
the
standard,
which
is
perfectly
suitable
for
one
purpose
under
12(b)(6),
is
suddenly
transplanted
to
be
used
to
determine
what
constitutes
frivolous
actions
under
section
1915(d).
this
court
would
never
take
that
step
with
a
paying
litigant,
risking
the
confusion
that
might
arise
from
confusing
rule
12
with
rule
11.
nor
would
this
court
take
this
step
with
respect
to
assessing
attorney's
fees
against
civil
rights
plaintiffs.
this
court
has
clearly
said
in
christianburg
garment,
case
decided
under
title
7
but
now
applied
under
the
civil
rights
attorney's
fees
statute,
generally,
that
attorney's
fees
can
be
assessed
against
a
civil
rights
plaintiff
only
if
the
plaintiff's
action
was
frivolous,
unreasonable,
or
without
foundation.
moreover,
in
a
prior
decision,
this
court
has
squarely
held
in
hughes
against
rowe
that
a
prisoner's
complaint
could
fail
to
state
a
claim,
yet
would
not
justify
the
imposition
of
sanctions
under
section
1988.
your
honor,
the
petitioners
rely
quite
heavily
upon
the
statement
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
that
the
complaint
failed
to
demonstrate
the
level
of
deliberate
indifference
necessary
to
survive
a
motion
to
dismiss
under
rule
12(b)(6).
we
contend
that
this
statement
is
simply
a
dictum,
that
what
the
court
meant
was
that
there
was
some
doubt
about
the
sufficiency
of
the
complaint,
as
it
went
on
to
state
explicitly
in
the
very
next
sentence
in
its
opinion.
moreover,
the
overall
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
consistent
with
this
interpretation
of
its
statement.
the
court
of
appeals
sent
the
case
back
down
to
the
district
court
for
further
adversary
proceedings
on
this
issue.
to
the
extent
that
petitioners
rely
upon
this
statement,
we
contend,
for
reasons
elaborated
in
part
iv
in
our
brief,
that
the
complaint
specifically
alleges,
often
with
supporting
evidence
in
exhibits
attached
to
the
complaint,
that
respondent
suffered
a
deliberate
indifference
to
serious
medical
needs.
in
any
event,
this
dictum
is
just
another
example
of
the
procedural
complications
that
ensue
from
sua
sponte
dismissal
of
a
complaint
for
failure
to
state
a
claim.
in
its
opinion,
the
court
of
appeals
plainly
meant
to
establish
an
orderly
procedure
for
disposition
of
actions
brought
by
indigent
litigants,
to
have
the
district
court
first
consider
sua
sponte
whether
a
complaint
has
any
rational
basis
in
law
or
fact.
if
it
does,
then
to
have
process
served
upon
the
defendant
and
entertain
a
motion
to
dismiss.
if
the
court
then
granted
the
motion
to
dismiss,
the
case
would
come
to
the
court
of
appeals,
as
it
does
in
ordinary
appellant
practice,
with
the
benefit
of
the
district
court's
considered
judgment
after
a
presentation
of
the
issues
on
the
sufficiency
of
the
complaint
by
both
sides.
it
is
that
procedure,
not
the
effect
of
an
unconsidered
dictum
of
the
court
of
appeals,
that
constitutes
the
only
question
of
general
significance
before
this
court
today.
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
decided
it
correctly.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
respondent
respectfully
requests
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
