unknown
speaker
when
you
say
it
doesn't
meet
the
pro
se
test,
mr.
spear,
you're
talking
about
the
rule
that
pro
se
complaints
are
liberally
construed
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff?
unknown
speaker
mr.
spear,
at
least
on,
on
the
face
of
the
language
there
appear
to
be
differences
between
the
two
provisions,
and
it
isn't
really
clear
to
me
that
they
would
necessarily
be
the
same.
do
you
think
that
rule
11,
which
is
designed,
according
to
the
notes,
to
help
eliminate
frivolous
claims,
is
implicated
every
time
a
complaint
is
dismissed
under
rule
12(b)(6)?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
that
the
frivolous
and
malicious
standard
under
the
statute
applies
to
factual
as
well
as
legal
aspects
of
the
complaint?
unknown
speaker
you
do?
unknown
speaker
does
the
district
court
have
the
power
on
its
own
sua
sponte
to
inquire
behind
the
fact
of
the
complaint
under
1915?
unknown
speaker
could
they
refer
it
to
a
magistrate
to
find
out
some
facts
on
whether
to
dismiss
under
1915?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
under
rule
12(b)
that
one
does
that,
or
does
one
look
just
to
the
face
of
the
complaint?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
spear,
you
say
that
in
the
southern
district
of
indiana
the
complaint
is
referred
to
a
magistrate
and
the
magistrate
makes
findings
as
to
whether
it
states
a
claim?
unknown
speaker
so,
the
magistrate
in
either
of
those
situations
doesn't
make
what
are...
what
would
normally
be
called
factual
findings?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
responded
to
me
that
it
was
perfectly
proper
under
1915
to
make
a
factual
inquiry?
unknown
speaker
mr.--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
spear,
can
i
just
a...
get
a
little
bit
more
about
the
procedure
you
actually
follow
in
the,
in
the
southern
district
of
indiana.
you
say
the
pro
se
complaint
is
filed.
it's
automatically
referred
by
the
clerk
to
a
magistrate.
or
does
it
go
through
the
judge's
office
first?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
and
then
the
magistrate
screens
it
and
he
decided
whether
it
states
a
cause
of
action
or
not.
and
does
he...
does
he--
unknown
speaker
--whether
the
financial
requirements.
unknown
speaker
and
that
no
service
is
made
on
the
defendant
while
this
is
being
done?
unknown
speaker
and
what
is...
is
there
a
rule
that
prescribes
how
promptly
he
must
do
this?
unknown
speaker
is
it
stamped--
unknown
speaker
--is
it
stamped
when
it's
delivered
to
the
clerk's
office
and
then...
is
there
a
docket
entry
made
and
a
case
file
opened
on
the
case?
unknown
speaker
it's
not
filed.
so
i
take
it
there's
no
time
stamp
on
when
it
comes
in
or--
unknown
speaker
--and
then
if
the...
then
when
the...
when
the
magistrate
gets
through
with
it
and
he
says,
"i
don't
think
this
is
worth
filing.
"
what
do
they
do?
mail
it
back
to
him
or
do
they
keep
a
copy
in
the
file?
unknown
speaker
but
he
sends
it
to
the
judge.
unknown
speaker
the
judge
says,
"i
agree
with
you".
and
i
imagine
routinely
the
judge
would
probably
agree
with
the
magistrate
because
there's
no
point
in
saying
the
magistrate...
if
the
judge
is
going
to
do
all
the
same
work
all
over
again.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
just
knowing
how
judges
work.
so,
the
judge
gets
with
the
magistrate's
recommendation.
and
what
does
the
judge
do?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
it's
then
given
a
cause
number?
it's
given
a
number
after
the
judge
says
it
should
not
be
filed?
unknown
speaker
and
then--
unknown
speaker
--and
when
does...
when
does
the
time
for
the
pro
se
petitioner
to
appeal
from
that
action
start
to
run
out?
unknown
speaker
from
the
time
it's
mailed
back
to
him
or...
'cause
i
gather
there's
no...
is
there
an
order
entered
by
the
district
judge
then?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
but
if
it
automatically
goes
to
the
state.
attorney
general's
office,
what
is
saved
by
not
sending
it
to
your
office
in
the
first
instance?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
see.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
ask
one
other
question.
it's
kind
of
a...
maybe
it's
kind
of
a
silly
in
a
way.
but
the
procedure
that
you
follow
deprives
the
defendant
of
knowledge
that
he
or
she
has
been
sued.
unknown
speaker
or
has
been
attempted
to
be
sued.
unknown
speaker
maybe
that's
good
and
maybe
it's
bad.
unknown
speaker
they
don't
have
to
hire
a
lawyer
or
come
into
court
or
anything.
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
spear.
mr.
rutherglen.
unknown
speaker
mr....
mr.
rutherglen,
when
was...
1915
was...
it's
a
pretty
old
statute.
it's
older
than
the
civil
rules
by
a
good
deal,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
know,
what...
what
congress
had
in
mind
concerning
frivolousness
for
purposes
of
dealing
with
the
federal
rules
doesn't
really...
there's
no
reason
to
think
it
had
anything
to
do
with
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
the
19th
century
when
it
decided
who
would
have
the
privilege
of
proceeding
in
litigation
without
paying
ordinary
court
costs.
unknown
speaker
just
as
a
matter
of
english
usage,
mr.
rutherglen,
failure
to
state
a
substantial
federal
question
does
not
sound
a
great
different
to
me
than
failure
to
state
a
claim
on
which
relief
can
be
granted.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
kind
of
hair-splitting
that
we
have
in
bell
against
hood
is
a
good
model
to
pattern
a
system
that's
going
to
process
an
awful
lot
of
indigent
complaints?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
courts
can
sua
sponte
dismiss
under
rule
12(b)(6)?
unknown
speaker
but
some
circuits
do,
do
they
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
you
have
to
grant
the
motion
to
proceed
in
favor
of
paupers,
the
case
has
to
be
docketed,
and
you
go
through
that
whole
procedure.
unknown
speaker
well,
i...
yeah,
but
your
submission
is
that
any
time
that
it
isn't
frivolous
you
go
through
that
procedure.
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
that's...
your
position
is
that
unless
it's
frivolous
you
go
through
that
procedure.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr....
mr....
the
statute
says,
"may
authorize
the
filing".
it
doesn't
say
"shall".
unknown
speaker
that
would
appear
to
give
discretion
to
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
answered...
you
agreed
with
justice
o'connor.
i
thought
that
that
some
districts
do.
some...
in
some
circuits
they
do
have
sua
sponte
dismissals
for
a
failure
to
state
a
cause
of
action.
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
the
difference?
a
paying
litigant,
he's
in
court
and
the
judge
just
says,
"i
don't
think
you
stated
a
cause
of
action.
"
and
he
dismisses
it
sua
sponte.
unknown
speaker
the
paying
client
ought
to
have
notice
that
he's
about
to
be
dismissed.
unknown
speaker
what
are
those?
unknown
speaker
frivolous
ones?
unknown
speaker
what's
the
difference
between
a
complaint
that
is
clearly
insufficient
and
one
that
fails
to
state
a
claim?
why
set
up
a
brand
new
standard?
unknown
speaker
and
that
applies
even
if
the
law
is
pretty
hard
to
figure
out?
unknown
speaker
you
can
still
figure
it
out
without
getting
into
any
further
factual
inquiry?
unknown
speaker
mr.
rutherglen,
do
you
have
any
guess
as
to
what
percentage...
i'm
trying
to
think
of,
of
how
many
cases
in
the
circuits
that
adopt
the,
the
rule
you're
arguing
against
would
be
affected
by
the,
by
the
rule
that
you
would
have
us
adopt.
how
many
of
these
pro
se
complaints
that
are
dismissed
without
further
proceedings
would
have
to
go
through
further
proceedings.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
are
you--
unknown
speaker
--how
many
would
be
clear
in,
in
your
estimation?
eighty
percent
or
closer
to
20
percent?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
there's
an
argument
on
the
motion
to
dismiss?
unknown
speaker
so
then
what
you
want
is
the,
the...
in
addition
to
the
plaintiff's
complaint,
the
defendant
would
presumably
file
a
motion
to
dismiss,
and
the
district
court,
which
apparently
would
have
felt
beforehand
that
the
complaint
failed
to
state
a
claim
for
relief,
is
now
given
additional
ammunition
to
reach
that
conclusion,
and
really
nothing
from
the
plaintiff.
unknown
speaker
but
the
plaintiff
is
pro
se,
presumably.
i
gather
that
brief
may
not
be
a
whole
lot
of
help
to
the
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
isn't--
unknown
speaker
--haines
against
kerner
enough
for
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
also
to
liberally
construe
the
complaint,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
rutherglen.
mr.
spear,
do
you
have
anything
more?
unknown
speaker
mr.
spear,
can
i
ask
you
this
question
on
the...
referring
especial...
specifically
to
estelle
against
gamble
and
the
complaint
against
the
medical
people
in
that
case--
unknown
speaker
--which
the
district
court
had
dismissed
the
complaint
and
under
your
view
it
should
have
found
it
frivolous
because
ultimately
the
dismissal
was
upheld,
even
though
the
court
of
appeals
thought
there
was
merit
to
the,
to
the
claim.
so
that,
in
your
view,
the
standard
of
being
frivolous
means
that
no
matter
serious
and
close
the
argument
may
be,
if
the
ultimate
determination
is
that
it
doesn't
state
a
claim,
it's
still
frivolous?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
wasn't
in
estelle.
it
wasn't
in
the
district
court
or
in
this
court.
unknown
speaker
and
that
was
a
close
case.
i
think
everyone
would
agree
to
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
think
that's
the
case,
then
what...
what
harm
is
there
to
adopt...
t
adopt
the
rule
that
mr.
rutherforn...
rutherglen
suggests?
unknown
speaker
if
you
think
it's
only
in
a
rare
case
anyway
that
anything
other
than
a
clear
complaint
is
going
to
be
dismissed
this
way,
you're
really
not
losing
anything.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
ten
o'clock.
