hear
argument
next
in
no.
87-2127,
american
foreign
service
association
v.
garfinkel.
ms.
goldman,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
unmarked,
that's
material
that
has
not
already
been
classified?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
don't
agree
that
it's
moot
then?
across
the
board
at
any
rate?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
goldman,
what
in
your
view
is
here
on
the
merits
or
that
ought
to
be
decided
either
under
terms
of
the
statute
or
under
terms
of
constitution?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's
scarcely
a
useful...
a
useful
use
of
an
hour
of
the
court's
time
simply
to
send
a
case
back
to
the
district
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
don't
you
challenge
that
ruling
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then,
i
must
have
misunderstood
your
answer
of
a
moment
age
because
i
thought
i'd
asked
you
what
on
the
merits,
so
to
speak,
either
statutory
or
constitutional,
is
before
us.
and
i
thought
you
said
in
fact
nothing.
but
that
wasn't
a
correct
understanding
of
what
you
said.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what's
your
position?
i
mean,
what
do
you
prefer?
what
are
you
urging
us
to
do?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
are
you
urging
us
to
do
now?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
decide
nothing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
goldman,
we
don't
ordinarily
correct
district
court
opinions
as
if
it
were
some
sort
of
a
test.
we...
we
decide
relatively
concrete
issues.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you've
still
got
ten
minutes
left.
do
you
want
to
speak
to
the
merits
on
the
possibility
that
the
court
may
choose
to
decide
the
merits?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
get
to
the
question
more
definitely.
justice
white
asked
you
a
particular
question.
i
think
it
can
be
answered
yes
or
no.
wasn't
that
the
constitution
machine
to
make
congress
keep...
forbid
the
executive
branch
from
dealing
with
negligent
employees?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
goldman.
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
can
a
form
be
invalid
on
its
face?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
form
just
refers
the
employees
to
a
law
library.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
does...
how
does
the
one
thing
you've
referred
to
so
far,
that
you're
not
allowed
to
make
any
unauthorized
disclosures...
how
does
that
help
anyone
if...
if...
if
that
simply
means
that
you
check
through
all
possible
applicable
laws
and
regulations
and
the
constitution
and
decide
whether
or
not
a
particular
disclosure
is
authorized?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
is
congress
bound
by
the
executive's
determination
in
that
respect?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
suppose
congress
says,
"we
don't
want
to
be
at
the
mercy
of
the
director
of
the
cia
when
we
want
this
kind
of
information;
we
want
it
right
now?
"
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
you
know,
a
privilege
is
not
necessarily
something
that
can't
be
overridden
by
congress.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
you
do
say
that
congress
could
not
by
statute
pass
a
law
that's
saying...
that
says
any
time
we
want
something
from
the
director
of
the
cia
if
the
appropriate
committee
votes
for
it
by
a
majority,
the
director
is
going
to
have
send
it
over?
if
that's
contrary
to
the
executive
order,
congress
can't
do
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
supposing
the
director
determines
it
shouldn't
be
furnished?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
supposing
it
gets
to
a
point
of
impasse?
you
say
that
an
act
of
congress
will
not
prevail
over
an
executive--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
who
determines
that?
i
mean,
congress
thought
it
determined
it
itself
when
it
said,
under
the
following
circumstances
the
director
of
the
cia
shall
furnish
us
information,
and
those
circumstances
are
now
complied
with.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
shouldn't
that
be
the
last
word?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--are
you
suggesting
that
the
term
take
care
that
the
laws
be
faithfully
executed
means
that
the
president
should
execute
them
cautiously?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
ms.
goldman,
you
have
one
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
goldman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
87-2127,
american
foreign
service
association
versus
garfinkel.
in
this
case,
the
district
court
invalidated
section
630
of
an
act
of
congress
dealing
with
disclosure
agreements
by
executive
branch
employees
as
an
impermissible
interference
with
the
president’s
authority
to
regulate
the
disclosure
of
national
security
information.
in
a
subsequent
ruling,
it
held
that
the
executives’
use
of
the
term
"classifiable"
was
impermissibly
vague
and
ordered
the
executive
to
discontinue
use
of
this
term.
in
light
of
this
development,
a
portion
of
appellant’s
lawsuit
is
moot.
other
questions,
however,
may
remain,
and
in
their
current
posture
of
best
resolved
in
the
first
instance
by
the
district
court.
we
therefore
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
and
remand
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
