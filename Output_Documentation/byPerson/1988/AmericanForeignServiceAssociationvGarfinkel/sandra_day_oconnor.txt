ms.
goldman,
isn't
the
dispute
about
the
use
of
the
term
classifiable
moot
now?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
hard
to
see
what's
left
of
that
at
all.
i
mean,
there
was...
garfinkel
put
a
notice
in
the
federal
register
modifying
the
existing
forms.
why
isn't
that
sufficient?
what's
left?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
ms.
goldman,
does
any
of
the
language
in
the
two
new
forms
now
in
use
actually
conflict
with
any
of
the
requirements
of
subsection
(1)
of
section
630?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
challenge
the
requirement
in
the
new
forms
that
the
employees
consult
or
confirm
the
classification
status
of
material
when
they
are
uncertain?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
have
any
problem
with
that
requirement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
isn't
that
precisely
what
lets
an
employee
know?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
making
an
inquiry?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
has
the
reason
to
know
regulation
or
standard
ever
been
applied
to
any
of
the
members
of
your
organization?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
think
it's
right
for
a
decision
then?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
we
look
at
the
old
forms,
not
the
new
ones?
