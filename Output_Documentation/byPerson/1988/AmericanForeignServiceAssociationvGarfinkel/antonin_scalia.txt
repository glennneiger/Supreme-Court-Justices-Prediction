justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
don't
agree
with
the
amici
here
that
know
includes
reason
to
know?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
all
that
necessary
if
you're
so
sure
that
know...
and
it
seems
to
make
sense
to
me...
that
know
doesn't
mean
reason
to
know?
if
that
is
obvious,
then
whether
the
district
court
ruled
upon
it
or
not,
it's
obvious.
and
so
long
as
there
is
that
one
problem,
the
constitutional
issue
has
to
be
reached,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you've
abandoned
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
all
a
lot
of
confusion,
and
it's
terribly
inconvenient
and
all
of
that.
but...
but
isn't
it
correct
that
unless
we
are
satisfied
that
there
is
doubt
as
to
whether
any
inconsistency
exists
between
the
statute
and
the
forms...
unless
there
is
doubt
on
every
one
of
these
issues,
we
ought
to
reach
the
constitutional
point,
shouldn't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
what
i'm
asking.
it
seems
to
me
to
avoid
reaching
the
constitutional
point,
we
have
to
be
satisfied
that
there
is
doubt
whether
any...
any...
item
on
these
forms
falls
to
comply
with
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
put
it
more
specifically,
if
i
think
that
know
does
not
mean
reason
to
know,
there
is
a
clear
discrepancy
between
the
forms
and
the
statute
and
we're
going
to
have
to
reach
the
constitutional
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
should
i
send
it
back
if
i
think
know
cannot
mean
reason
to
know?
what
possible
basis
would
there
be
to
send
it
back?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
we
could
reverse
that
and
send
it
back
and
say,
look
at
it
piece
by
piece.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
they're
wrong
about
that.
and
if
they're
right
about
that,
we
affirm
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
i
thought
you
originally
asked.
but
i
don't
see
why
it's
changed.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
other
authority
if
the
person
has
already
left
the
service?
i
mean,
the
advantage
of
these
contractual
agreements
is
that
it
continues
to
bind
the
person
after
he's
left.
how
are
you
going
to
punish
him
administratively
when
he's
left?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
may
not
be
any
way
to...
to
punish
the
negligent
employee.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they've
had
access
already
in
the
past.
then
they
leave
the
government
and
you're
saying
there's...
or,
congress
has
said
there
is
no
way
the
president
can
require
these
people
to
be
careful
about
what
they
thereafter
say.
isn't
that
what
it
comes
down
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
they
know.
but
they
don't
have
to
be
careful.
justice
antonin
scalia
boy,
that
will
fix
them.
we
won't
rehire
you
after
you've
left.
well,
though,
i
don't
think
that's
a
fair
reading
of
the
statute
anyway.
the
statute
is
broader
than
these
particular
agreements,
any
policy
or
contract.
i
mean,
so
the
government
couldn't
even
enforce
a
policy
of
disciplining
people
who
were
careless.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
construe
the
word
policy
by
just
erasing
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
wait
a
minute.
and
you
think
that
that
court
action
would
be
valid?
you...
you
are,
as
i
understand
what
you've
said
so
far,
you
are
not
asserting
that
in
law
congress
cannot
demand
that
from
the
executive
and
get
it.
you
do
not
assert
any
legal
privilege
for
the
executive
to
withhold
information
from
congress.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
enforceable
in
the
courts?
justice
antonin
scalia
assume
the
dispute
gets
here.
an
executive
officer
obeys...
obeys
the
president,
does
not
turn
the
information
over.
he
is
prosecuted
under
a
statute
that
congress
has
passed.
prosecuted.
we
get
a
special
prosecutor
in
to
prosecute
him.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
what
happens
in
this
prosecution
that
i
just
posited?
would
you...
do
you
assert
that
there
is
a...
that
the
prosecution
would
not
be
able
to
proceed
because
of
the
president's
privilege
not
to
turn
over
the
information?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that's
what
this
case
was
all
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
it
takes
money
to
fire
somebody.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
(1)?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
it
doesn't
address
the...
it
does
address
the...
it
says
if
it's
that
kind
of
information,
whether
it's
known
to
be
or
not.
how
do
you
say
that
doesn't
address
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
whether
or
not
he
knows
it.
so
why
doesn't
that
contradict
(1)?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kneedler,
i
just
don't
understand
the
logic
of
your
assertion
that
the
regulation
somehow
alters
the
problem.
it
seems
to
me
if
the
form
itself
says
this
kind
of
information
you
will
be
liable
if
you
disclose.
classified
or
classifiable.
period.
it
says
nothing
about
knowledge.
what
that
means
to
me
is
if
you
disclose
it,
you're
liable.
now
you
come
up
with
a
regulation
that
says,
well,
you
won't
be
liable
if
you
didn't
have
any
reason
to
know
that
it
was
classified
or...
well,
that's
very
nice,
and
that
makes
the
form
more
liberal
although
still
not
liberal
enough
to
comply
with
the
statute,
it
seems
to
me.
but
i
don't
know
how
you
can
say
that
the
form
itself
does
not
speak
to
knowledge.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
knowledge.
but
what
it
says
when
it
doesn't
mention
knowledge
is
that
your
knowledge
doesn't
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kneedler,
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
just
viewing
the
judgment
below
very
narrowly
is
just
passing
on
the
two
forms
challenged
in
the
complaint.
if
we
were
to
affirm
on
the
theory
you
recommend,
they
could
immediately
file
another
lawsuit
challenging
the
the
new
forms
on
the
theories
that...
on
the
basis
that
they're
advocating
today.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
it
really
doesn't
make
an
awful
lot
of
difference
whether...
assuming
we
do
one
of
the
two
things,
whether
we
affirm
on
your
theory
or
we
vacate
and
remand
on
their
theory,
and
let
them
litigate
in
this
case.
i
mean,
they
really
come
down
to
pretty
much
the
same.
