justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
this?
in
putting
to
one
side
the
problems
of
remedy
and
notice,
but
just
the
question
of
what
statutory
violations
you
contend
are
there...
if
you
go
back
to
the
district
court,
you
know.
the
only
one,
am
i
correct,
is
that
there
is
a
difference
between
reason
to
know
and
to
know
within
the
meaning
of
section
1?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
a
violation
of
subparagraph
(4)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
it
interferes--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but,
now,
isn't
it...
isn't
it
argued
by
one
of
the
briefs
that
such
a
prior
authorization
requirement
already
exists
and
that,
therefore,
the
statute
really
didn't
change
the
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
there
may
be
no
statutory
violation...
there
may
be
no
second
statutory
violation
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you...
i
just
wanted
to
say
one
thing.
isn't
it
true
that
there
might
be
quite
a
difference
in
the
constitutional
issue
whether
we're
just
focusing
on
section
1
or
the
entire
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
district
court
didn't
focus
on
section
1,
as
i
remember.
justice
john
paul
stevens
any
other
nondisclosure
policy,
form
or
agreement,
if
such
policy,
form
or
agreement...
it
didn't
just
say
agreements.
you're
not
really
suggesting
that
that
kind
of
a
limitation
on
the
executive
is
in
any
interference
at
all
with
his
ability
to
execute
the
laws?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr:
kneedler,
can
i...
i
understand
the
problem
on
section
1.
but
turning
to
section
3
and
4
for
a
second,
is
there
anything
in
this
record
to
tell
us
to
what
extent,
if
any,
there
are
some
policies
out
there
that
directly
or
indirectly
obstruct
information
flowing
to
congress?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
there
a
need
for
some
findings
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
even
so,
do
these
forms
on
their
face
interfere
with
the
right
of
congress
to
obtain
executive
branch
information
in
a
secure
manner,
and
so
forth?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then...
then,
on
their
face,
their
is
no
violation
of
3
or
4.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
at
the
very
least,
there
is
no
constitutional
issue
to
decide
with
respect
to
(3)
and
(4)
on
the
present
state
of
the
record.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
if
we
were
to
affirm
the
district
court
on
the
theory,
you
say
we
would
not
affirm
the
district
court's
reasoning
with
respect
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--because
we
don't
agree--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
only
thing
i'm
suggesting
is
that
your
theory
of
affirmance
does
not
necessarily
put
the
litigation
in
a
broader
sense
to
an
end.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
even
in
that
word...
we're
interpreting
the
next
year's
status.
this
is
just
a
one-year
appropriation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
kneedler,
i
just
can't...
i
can't
avoid
interrupting
you
with
this
thought.
the
constitution
also
gives
congress
the
power
to
provide
for
a
navy
and
for
the
armed
forces,
and
so
forth,
and
often
classified
information
is
highly
relevant
to
their
task.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
of
course,
the
constitutional
question
is
suppose
the
executive
decides
not
to
share
some
information
that
congress
thinks
it
needs.
that's...
that's
what
we--
