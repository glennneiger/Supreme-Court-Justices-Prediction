but
don't
you...
don't
you
agree
that
we
don't
need
to
deal...
we
don't
need
to
deal
with
that
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
don't
need
to
talk
much
about
it
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
are
suggesting
we
really
shouldn't
decide
anything,
we
should
just
send
it
back
and
have
the
district
court
sort
things
out.
but,
of
course,
we
could
but
you
think
we
shouldn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
jurisdictional
statement
presented
just...
question
one
was
the
constitutional
issue,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
now
you
say
we
shouldn't
decide
it?
i
mean,
that's
what
we
noted
probable
jurisdiction
on.
justice
byron
r.
white
have
you
changed
your
mind
since
you
filed
your
jurisdictional
statement?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
wouldn't
be
a
crime,
of
course.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
the
requirement
of
knowledge
means
that
the
executive
branch
has
to
put
up
with
the
negligence
of
employees.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
when
they're
dealing
with
classified
information?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
not
necessarily.
but
ever?
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
you
can't
use
these
kinds
of
contracts?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
shouldn't...
why
shouldn't
the
government
say,
please
be
careful?
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
congress
thought
that
the
executive
branch
couldn't
do
anything
about
negligent
employees
who
were
dealing
with
classified
information.
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
use
any
money
to
get
after
these
people.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
partly
correct
or
not
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
just
can't
deal
with...
you
just
can't
do
anything
about
negligent
employees?
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
justice
stevens
has
just
read
me
something
that
sounds
like--
justice
byron
r.
white
--are
you
saying
that
congress
may
forbid
the
executive
branch
from
taking
action
against
non-knowing
but
negligent
employees?
that
he
has
that
kind
of
power.
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
don't
want
us
to
reach
the
constitutional
issue
either?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
want
us
to
try
the
case
right
up
here
[inaudible]?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
want
us
to
do
what
the
district
court
didn't
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
also,
we
aren't
accustomed
to
having
respondents
ask
us
to
affirm
on
different
ground
than
saying
i'm
sorry
but
we
think
that
somebody
else
should
decide
it
first.
justice
byron
r.
white
--the
statute
doesn't...
wouldn't...
it
forbids
using
money
to
enforce
these--
justice
byron
r.
white
--that
certainly
wouldn't...
it
didn't
purport
to
forbid
the
central
intelligence
agency
from
firing
a
person
who
furnishes
this
information
without
authorization.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
kneedler,
i
take
it
you
must
have
urged
the
district
court
to
take
the
action
that
he
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
made
that
to
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
effect
you're
saying
that
anything
about
sections
(3)
and
(4)
are
just
not
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about...
did
congress
in
the...
in
taking
action,
did
it
require
the
knowledge
issue
to
be
put
in
the
form?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
didn't
put
any
knowledge
limitation
on
it.
only
the
form
is
being
challenged,
you
just
don't
even
get
to
the
knowdge
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
just
don't
think
the
constitutional
issue
as
being
here
or...
or
on
the
knowledge
part?
