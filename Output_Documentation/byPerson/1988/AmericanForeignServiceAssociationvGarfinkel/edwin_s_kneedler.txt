mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
take
a
few
moments
at
the
outset
to
summarize
what
the
government's
position
is
in
this
case,
with
respect
to
the
proper
disposition.
contrary
to
appellants'
view,
we
don't
believe
that
there
is
a
need
to
remand
this
case
to
the
district
court.
we
think
the
judgment
can
and
should
be
properly
affirmed.
this
court
reviews
judgments,
not
opinions
of
lower
courts,
and
in
this
case
we
believe
that
the
judgment
below
sustaining
the
forms
against
the
challenge
brought
by
the
appellants
was
correctly
entered.
the
appellants
have
argued
this
case
as
if...
as
if
the
issue
were
our
challenge
to
section
630.
that's
not
the
issue
before
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--we
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
do
so
because
in
our
view
the
forms
that
they
have
challenged
comply
with
the
statute.
we
aren't
suggesting
sending
it
back.
in
our
view,
the
forms
comply
with
the
statute.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
don't
think
it's
a
need
to
try
the
case.
this
court
has
often--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
this
court
is
accustomed,
when
a
lower
court
decides
a
constitutional
question,
to
first
looking
at
a
statutory
question
in
reviewing
the
judgment.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
that's
obviously
within...
within
the
court's
authority
and
discretion.
but
we
don't...
we
don't
think
that
it's
necessary
to
do
so
here
with
respect
to
the
questions
of
statute
construction
that
are
raised.
we
think
this
court
can
address
those
as
well
as
the
district
court.
but...
but
the
point
i
was
making
is
that
appellants
brought
this
suit
to
challenge
the
nondisclosure
agreements,
two
in
particular,
4193
and
form
189,
on
their
face.
as
part
of
their
challenge,
they
invoke
section
630.
but
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
those
forms
are
invalid,
or
were
invalid...
they've
now
been
superseded...
whether
those
forms
were
invalid
on
their
face
and
therefore
should
be
enjoined
under
section
630.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
for,
for
example,
with
respect
to
the
question
of
disclosures
to
congress,
the
form
states
that
unauthorized
disclosures
are
barred
and
the
employee
undertakes
never
to
make
an
unauthorized
disclosure.
now,
in
our
view
that
is
certainly
valid
because,
for
example,
the
appellants
would
argue
that
their
members
have
a
first
amendment
right
to
petition
congress
through
divulging
classified
information
without
going
through
channels.
our
position
is
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
confer
any
such
right.
but
if
it
did,
that
presumably
would
be
an
authorized
disclosure
within
the
meaning
of
the
form.
so,
the
disagreement
about
whether
there
is
a
substance
of
right
is
not
really
in
this
case.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
it
refers
them...
these
employees
are
not...
receive
a
lot
of
instruction
as
to
what
their
obligations
are.
these
forms
were
intended
to
embody
and
in
fact
codify
obligations
that
employees
have
from
independent
sources.
from
the
class--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
in
fact,
for
employees
it's
far
easier
than
that.
they
can
check
with...
they
can
check
through
channels
to
see
whether
a
particular
disclosure
is
authorized,
and
that's
exactly
how
the
regime
for
regulating
classified
information
within
the
executive
branch
is
intended
to
work.
the
president
has
control,
as
this
court
said
in
egan
last
term,
over
classified
information.
the
instrument
of
his
exercise
of
control
over
that
is
the
executive
order
12356,
and
each
of
the
agencies
that
administers
classified
information
has
rather
specific
instructions
and
guidelines
that
they
furnish
to
employees
to
tell
them
what
their
obligations
are.
and,
in
fact,
a
paragraph
of
the
agreements
at
issue
here,
in
the
forms
the
employee
acknowledges
that
he's
been
briefed
as
to
what
his
obligations
are.
and,
for
example,
in
the
specific
instance
of
disclosing
information
to
congress,
it's
clear
and
has
been
for
a
long
time,
that
a
disclosure
to
a
member
of
congress
is
like
a
disclosure
to
anyone
else.
the
recipient
is
not
authorized
to
receive
it
unless
he
is
determined
to
have
a
need
to
know
that
particular
information.
it's
not
enough
that
he
may
be
trustworthy
as
a
general
matter.
he
has
to
be
determined
to
have
a
need
to
know.
and
that
is
a
standard
that
is
set
forth
in
the
executive
order
itself
through
which
the
president
has
regulated
the
access
to
classified
information.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
congress
is
not
bound
in
several
respects,
but
it
is...
let
me
explain
my
answer.
it's
certainly
not
bound
with
respect
to
its
own
internal
handling
of
classified
information.
the
second
question
would
come
if
congress
itself
wanted
to
obtain
classified
information
from
the
executive
branch.
that
could
be
done
through
a
request
or
a
subpoena.
the
judgment
as
to
whether
that
information
would
be
furnished
to
congress
would
be
made
by
the
person
who
has
custody
of
it
or
a
person
to
whom
that
authority
has
been
delegated.
for
example,
in
the
cia,
that
authority
is
vested
in
the
director
of
central
intelligence.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
think
that's
another
way
of
saying
that
congress
doesn't
like
a
national
security
or
state
secret
privilege
that
has
long
been
recognized
in
the
executive
branch.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
in
this
particular
case,
we
believe
this
is
a
privilege
that
cannot
be
overridden
by
congress
because
it
is
a
privilege
that
derives
directly
from
the
constitutional
authorities
of
the
president
under
article
ii
of
the
constitution.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
that
wouldn't
be
contrary
to
the
executive
order
because
if
the
director
of
central
intelligence
determines
that
that
information
should
be
furnished,
then
it's
an
authorized
disclosure.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
that
is...
that
is
an
example
of
the
give-and-take
between
the
political
branches
that
frequently
goes
on.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
not
necessarily.
it
may
be
that
after
there...
that
after
there
has
been
a
disagreement
between
the
two
branches
that
it
would
be
determine
that
congress'
need
for
the
particular
information--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
presumably
the
director
of
central
intelligence
is
not
going
to
withhold
information
under
the
statute
like
that--
--well,
then...
then,
if
he
does,
then
the
committee
concerned
would...
would
bring
contempt
proceedings
against
the
director
or...
or
if
a
court
action
were
possible,
that
could
be
pursued.
but
let
me
back
up
a
minute.
that
question--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--oh,
no.
i'm
saying
there
is
a
constitutionally-derived
privilege.
how...
how--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
there
may
be
a
political
question,
doctrine
problem,
or
something
if
a
lawsuit
was
brought
in
that
circumstance.
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
that
the
court
should
lightly
entertain
a
dispute
between
the
congress
and
the
executive
branch
with
respect
to
seeking
information
in
situations--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
it
may
be
on
a
particular
case
that
this
court
would
hold
that
the
president's
claim
of
privilege
is
valid.
in
united
states
v.
nixon,
which
dealt
with
deliberative
privilege...
deliberative
process
privilege,
this
court
weighed
the
computing
interests
and
determined
the
information
had
to
be
turned
over.
but
it
was
careful
to
point
out
that
the
case
did
not
involve
state
secrets
types
of--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--our
initial
position
i
think
would
be
yes,
that
the
prosecution
could
not
proceed.
but
if--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but...
but
no,
i
think
it's
not,
because
what
we
have
at
issue
here
is
not...
is
not
a
statute
by
which
congress
speaks
to
the
director
of
central
intelligence.
he's
not
asking
the
president
nor
the
person
immediately
responsible
to
the
president
to
furnish
information.
what
congress
is
purporting
to
do
is
to
put
a
barrier,
an
obstacle,
between
the
director
of
central
intelligence,
in
this
example,
and
lower
ranking
employees
and
saying
the
lower
ranking
employees
can
basically
circumvent
the
director
of
central
intelligence's
decision
of
whether
to
furnish
the
information
or
not
by
going
directly
to
congress
with
the
particular
information.
that's
all
that
has
to
be
decided
in
this
case.
and
i
think
in
the
example
that
justice
scalia
was
describing,
depending
on
the
circumstances,
yes,
indeed,
i
think
that
the
president,
under...
under
what
this
court
said
in
united
states
v.
nixon,
would
in
appropriate
circumstances
have
the
authority
to
withhold
the
information.
but
that's
not
what's
at
issue
here.
what's
at
issue
here
is
an
attempt
by
congress
to
take
that
decision
away
from
the
president
in
the
first
place,
and
to
allow
it
to
a
lower-ranking
employee
to
decide
whether
he's
going
to
run
to
congress
with
classified
information
where
the
appropriate
authorities
in
the
executive
branch
haven't
even
had
a
chance
to
pass
on
the
question
of
whether
the
information
should
be
furnished
or
not.
but,
mr.
kneedler,
if
the
information
is
by
hypothesis
classified,
i
didn't
read
the
act
of
congress
involved
in
this
case
as
saying
that
an
employee
could
run
to
congress
with
it.
depending
on
how
subsections
(3)
and
(4)
are
read.
if
subsections
(3)
and
(4)
were
read
broadly,
they
could...
they
could
be
read
to
say
that
an
employee
has
a
right
to
take
even
classified
information
to
congress.
now,
as
ms.
goldman
has
pointed
out,
the
parties
and
the
others
who
have
filed
briefs
in
this
case
are
in
agreement
that
it
doesn't
confer
a
new
right
to
furnish
information...
classified
information
to
congress.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
it
refers
one
to
some
other
source.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it's
written
as--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
again,
it
would
depend
on
how
the
statute
were
read.
as
justice
stevens
was
pointing
out,
it
is
written
in
rather
broad
terms.
barring
the
expenditure
of
money
to
implement
or
enforce
a
policy
or
agreement...
conceivably
it
could
be
read
to
prohibit
even
firing
somebody
because
that
would
be
implementing
or
enforcing
a
policy.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
i
mean,
we
would...
we
would...
we
would
certainly
hope
that
either
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
or
constitutional
law
that
the
hands
of
the
director
of
central
intelligence
or
the
secretary
of
state,
or
whoever
else
is
responsible
for
the
classified
information,
wouldn't
be
put
in
the
position
where
he
would
have
to
tolerate
either
negligent
disclosures
or
disclosures...
disseminations
of
information
by
people
who
don't
have
authority.
and
that's
our
problem
with
this
statute.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
is
this--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
i
think
not.
first
of
all,
this
complaint
only
challenges
the
forms.
it
doesn't
challenge
any
policies.
again,
this
is
a
lawsuit
brought
to
challenge
two
particular
forms.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
not
policies.
so,
the
policies
that
may...
to
which
form
may
refer
one,
are
not
part
of
this
case.
this
is
just
a
question
of
whether
the
forms
are
valid
on
their
face.
and
it
is
the
general
policy
in
most
departments
and
agencies--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--they
do
not...
they
do
not
on
their
face
because,
again,
they
only
prohibit
this--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
right.
and
that's
why
we
say
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed
as
to
subsections
(3)
and
(4).
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is...
that
is
correct.
because
only
unauthorized
disclosures
are
prohibited.
we
say
that
no...
that
no--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no
furnishing
of
information
is
permitted.
the
other
side
might
disagree.
but
the
forms
themselves
simply
refer
one
to
whatever--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
all...
again,
it's
just
the
judgment--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
is
before
the
court.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but,
again,
let
we
reiterate
that
this
reading
of
the
statute
we
think
would
properly
be
informed
by
the
serious
constitutional
questions
that
would
be
presented
if...
if
there
were
a
statute
passed
that
purported
to
allow
any
lower-ranking
employee
in
the
executive
branch
to
take
it
upon
himself
to
divulge
information
to
congress.
the
federalist
64
that
we
quoted
at
page
43
in
our
brief
and
the
early
experience
with
president
washington
in
furnishing
information
to
congress
about
the
jay
treaty,
demonstrate
an
early
understanding
that
the
executive
was
permitted
to
withhold
information
from
congress
where
the
president
determined
that
that
was
the
proper
thing
to
do.
and
it
surely
can't
be,
for
example,
that
the
first
congress
could
have
passed
a
statute
requiring
some
lower-ranking
person
to
turn
over
the
information
about
the
jay
treaty
that
the
president
had
personally
declined
to
furnish.
and
that's
the
issue
in
this
case.
it's
not
the
ultimate
question
of
whether
the
president
or
the
secretary
of
state
will
furnish
information
to
congress,
but
whether
they
will
be
deprived
of
the
opportunity
to
even
pass
on
that
question.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
our
first
position
was
that...
was
to
urge
statutory
grounds
why
the...
this
precise
argument
i'm
describing
here
with
respect
to
unauthorized
disclosures.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
we
made
that
to
the
district
court.
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
don't
think
that's...
i
don't
think
it's
a
question
of
rightness.
i
think
the
appellants
brought
this
suit
as
a
challenge
to
the
forms,
and
we're
saying
the
forms
are
valid.
and,
therefore,
the
judgment
denying
them
relief
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
as
to
(1)
the
only
form...
the
only
two
forms
that
they
challenged
in
this
case,
4193
and
189,
don't
present
this
question.
the...
those
forms
as
they
were
in
effect
at
the
time
this
statute
was
passed,
referred
to
classified
or
classifiable
information
in
addressing
the
substance
of
the
information
that
is
subject
to
the
forms.
after
the...
after
the
concern
about
classifiable,
those
forms
were
amended
in
september
of
1988
to
substitute...
to
delete
the
word
classifiable
and
to
substitute
in
its
place
the
information
to
which
that
term
was
always
intended
to
apply,
which
is
information
that's
marked
classified,
unmarked
classified
information
such
as
oral
communications,
or
information
that's
in
the
process
of
a
classification
determination.
that
substitute
language
that
is
put
into
the
forms
themselves,
likewise,
does
not
address
the
knowledge
issue.
the
question
as
to
4193
and
189...
the
question
of--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i
think
that...
i
think
the
information
that
is
the
subject
of
the
forms
is
something
that
should
be
objectively
ascertainable,
and
i
think
that's
what...
that's
what
paragraph
1
of
those
forms
is
directed
to.
objectively
ascertainable
so
that
every
employee
who
handles
that
information
is
subject
to
the
same
responsibilities
with
respect
to
it,
whether
or
not
he
knows
that
it's
classified.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
standard
of
care
is
not
addressed
in
the
form.
it's
addressed
in
the
regulation.
insofar
as
189
is
concerned,
it
was
promulgated
by
the
director
of
the
information
security
oversight
office.
it's
not
a
separate
regulation
that
says
if
an
employee
discloses
information
that
is
the
subject
of
the
form
that
he
knows
to
be
classified
or
has
reason
to
know.
then,
in
those
circumstances,
the
regulation
would
attach
liability.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
it's
a
negative.
the
funds
can't
be
used
for
a
form
that
applies
to
information
other
than
that
that
is
marked
classified
or
that
the
employees
knows
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
our
position.
and
the
question
of...
the
question
of
if
an
employee
makes
a
negligent
disclosure,
in
our
view,
that
is
a
question
of
enforcing
the
form.
not
enforcing
the
form...
excuse
me...
enforcing
the
regulation.
and
that's
a
question
that
would
be
raised...
that
would
be
at
a
time
an
enforcement
action
was
brought?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
court
can
affirm
the
judgment
below.
i
think
yes.
as
to...
as
to
these
two
forms
without
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's...
that
is
actually
all
that's
before
this
case
because
the
complaint
only
challenges
4193
and
section
189.
now,
i'd
like
to
make...
one...
clarify
one
thing.
on
the
4193
in
a
paragraph
other
than
the
one
that
describes
the
information
that's
subject
to
the
form,
there
is
a
pre-publication
review
paragraph
that...
in
form
4193
that
also
exists
in
4355
that
does
obligate
the
employee...
it's
a
snap
sort
of
requirement.
it
obligates
an
employee
with
access
to
sensitive
compartmented
information
to...
to
ascertain
whether...
or
to
have
it
reviewed
to
see
whether...
whether
it
can
be
released.
and
in
that
section
there
is
a
reference
to
the
reason
to
believe...
that
an
employee
has
to
check
if
he
has
reason
to
believe
that
certain
information
he
wants
to
disclose
is
derived
from
sci.
but
we
view
that
as
just
one
set
of...
one
subset
of
the
larger
question
of
a
prepublication
review
requirement
and
appellants
did
not
focus
or
challenge
in
the
district
court
on
prepublication
review.
they
challenged
it
primarily
on
the...
challenging
these
two
forms
on
their
face.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
think
that's
a
question
of
enforcing
the
obligation
under
the
form.
and
the
statute
speaks
both
in
terms
of
implementing
and
enforcing.
appellants
brought
this
challenge
primarily
to
the
implementation
of
the
forms.
they
were
really
saying
that...
that
4193
and
189
have
to
be
suspended
altogether
because
those
forms
were
named
by
number
in
the
statute.
that
was
really
the
basis
of
their
challenge
in
the
district
court
primarily.
those
forms
have
since
been
superseded.
but,
again,
the
form
on
its
face
did
not...
did
not
say
that.
i
think
it's
a
question
of
its
just
being
unaddressed.
and
if
in
a
particular
application
of
the
enforcement
policy,
it
was
applied
against
somebody
who
disclosed
something
he
had
reason
to
know
but
didn't
have
subjective
knowledge,
then
that
would
be
a
question
to
be
litigated
then.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is...
yes,
i
think
that's
largely
correct.
i
mean,
there
may
be
some
issues--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
they
may.
although
it
seems
to
us
that
there's
a
real
value
in
putting
this
litigation
to
an
end.
i
mean,
we...
we
were
concerned
about
this
statute,
particularly
in
the
early
periods,
because
on
its
face
it
seemed
to
bespeak
a
congressional
intent
to
lift
a
lot
of
controls
over
classified
information,
which
we
were
concerned
could
send
disturbing
signals
not
only
to
executive
branch
employees
but
to
foreign
nations
who
share
intelligence
and
other
information
with
us.
and
so--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
it...
may
or
may
not,
depending
on...
depending
on
what
happens.
the
appellants
had
an
opportunity
to
amend
the
complaint
to
challenge
4355
presumably
after
it
was
issue
in
march
of
'89...
excuse
me...
march
of
'88
and
didn't
joint
issue
on
that.
but
you
may
be
right
as
to
that.
but
in
terms
of
interpreting
this
particular
statute,
to
the
extent
this
court
would
feel
that
it
would
be
in
as
good
a
position
as
the
district
court
on
remand
to
decide
exactly
what
the
statute
means,
that's
something
that...
that
could
be
done
now--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
in
fact...
although
i'm
saying
630,
in
fact
it's
section
619.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
which
was
enacted...
or,
it
came
into
effect
after
these
two
forms
that
were
challenged
were
superseded.
if...
going
back
to
justice
scalia's
question.
if
the
court
should
conclude
that
there
is
an
irreconcilable
conflict
between
the
forms
on
their
fact
and
the
statute,
and
that
the
statute
has
to
be
read
to
tie
the
executive's
hands
in
disciplining
or
taking
other
action
against
somebody
who
makes
a
negligent
disclosure
of
something
he
should
know
is
classified,
then
we
do
believe
the
statute
would
be
unconstitutional
for
the
reasons
that
were
alluded
to
by
several
members
of
the
court.
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
why
we
think
this
is
so.
perhaps
the
most
explicit
comes
from
article
ii
of
the
constitution
itself,
which
obligates
the
president
to
take
care
that
the
laws
be
faithfully
executed.
and
care
suggests
caution,
and
in
the
area
of
national
security
information
it
suggests
the
utmost
caution.
and
that
obligation
of
care
is
properly
passed
on
to
the
persons
who
assist
the
president
of
the
united
states
in
foreign
relations
and
national
security
matters
and
entitle
him
to
insist
that
the
lower-ranking
employees
who
have
access
to
national
security
information
have
to
exercise
the
utmost
care.
and,
in
fact,
that
was
the
premise
of
this
court's
decision
in--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--in
snepp
and
egan
and
other
cases.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
president
has
an
obligation
to
be
circumspect...
has
an
obligation
that
fits...
that
fits
the
subject
matter.
and
when
we're
talking
about
the
subject
matter
of
national
security
information,
he
has
an
obligation
to
exercise
the
care
and
to
see
that
his
subordinates
have
exercised
the
care
that
is
appropriate
to
the
circumstances.
and,
as
i
say,
in
snepp,
the
court
recognized
that
an
intelligence
agent's
position
was
one
of
high
trust
and
fiduciary
obligation
by
virtue
of
his
assuming
that
position.
and
as
an
aspect
of
that,
such
an
employee
is
briefed
as
to
what
his
obligations
are,
and
someone
who
is
experienced
in
operating
in
this
field
is
not
going
to
be
at
sea
in
determining
what
information
he
can
disclose
and
what
he
can't.
and
we
think
that
it
would
greatly
disrupt
the
constitutional
structure
for
congress
to
be
in
a
position
to
tell
the
president
that
he
cannot
take
action
against
someone
who
carelessly
discloses
information
that
is
in...
in
fact
touches
on
the
national
security
and
does
so
without
ever
checking
with
the
appropriate
authorities
in
the
government
to
see
whether
the
information
is
in
fact
subject
to
being
protected.
in
fact,
that
was
the
theme
of
the
snepp
decision,
which
was
that
an
employee
properly
should
err
on
the
side
of
caution
and
check
with
the
agency
where
he
was
employed
before
he
discloses
the
information.
and
we
think
that
that
is
exactly
what
the
constitution
requires
itself.
and
although
this
case
can
do
disposed
of
on
statutory
grounds,
we
would
urge
the
court
to
bear
clearly
in
mind
the
substantial
constitutional
problems
that
would
be
raised
with
both...
with
respect
to
both
paragraphs
3
and
4
of
this
statute,
and
paragraph
1,
if
the
statute
were
allowed
to
be
applied
in
a
way
that
would
disrupt
the
president's
control
over
national
security
information.
let
me
say,
too,
that
the...
that
the...
going
back
on
the
question
of
furnishing
information
to
congress.
we're
not
suggesting
that
the
president
or
the
director
of
central
intelligence,
or
other
officials,
are
going
to
lightly
withhold
information
from
congress.
our
point
is
that
it's
a
question
of
cooperation
between
the
branches.
and
50
usc
413,
which
we've
cited
in
the
brief,
which
provides
for
the
director
to
share
information
with
the
intelligence
committees
is
exactly
the
sort
of
cooperative
arrangement
through
official
channels,
with
decisions
being
made
by
the
appropriate
officials
in
the
executive
branch.
that's...
that's
exactly
the
way
we
think
things
should
operate.
in
fact,
the
constitution
itself
suggests
exactly
that
arrangement
because
it
assigns
to
the
president
that
responsibility
to
furnish
information
to
congress
concerning
the
state
of
the
union,
which
would
necessarily
include
classified
information
within
the
executive
branch.
it
assigns
that
power
to
the
president.
now,
when
you
have
other...
other
functions
assigned
to
other
agencies
of
the
government,
by
statute
maybe
different
questions
arise.
but
there
the
subject
matter
is
one
that
is
vested
in
the
president
directly
by
virtue
of
the
constitution
itself,
as
commander-in-chief,
as
the
sole
organ
of
the
nation
in
foreign
affairs,
then
the
president
has
to...
has
to
have
unimpeded
control
over
the
information
within
the
executive
branch.
and
that's
what
we
think
this
case
is
ultimately
about.
just
as
the
commander-in-chief
has
to
be
able
to
command
people,
subordinates,
in
the
executive
branch,
so
too
does
the
head
of
the
executive
branch
in
the
area
of
national
affairs
have
to
have
that
responsibility.
and
control
over
national
security
information
in
the
executive
branch
is
merely
one
subset
or
one
part
of
the
president's
overall
responsibility
for
the
conduct
of
the
national
security
within
the
executive
branch.
that's
something
quite
different
from
the
power
of
congress
addressing
something
to
the
president
to
request
information
or
to
command
that
the
president
perform
certain
substantive
duties.
but
in
terms
of
the
responsibility
for
keeping
his
own
house
in
order
and
for
the
performance
of
the
jobs
by
his
own
subordinates
in
whom
he
has
to
trust...
have
the
utmost
trust,
then
we
think
that
congress
cannot
disrupt
the
arrangement
that
the
constitution
assigns.
and
the
first
congress
recognized
this
by--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
and...
and
the
arrangements
that
have
been
worked
out
between
the
branches
are
that
the
executive
branch
shares
through
proper
channels
an
enormous
amount
of
classified
information.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
and
the
congress
has
the
power
of
the
purse
ultimately
by
saying,
if
you
want
an
army,
you'd
better
furnish
the
information
that
enables
us
to
consider
that
question
intelligently.
and
that
is
exactly
the
way
the
framers
of
the
constitution
contemplated
that
questions
concerning
the
national
security
would
be
resolved.
by
cooperation
between
the
branches.
and
our
concern
with
this
statute,
at
least
the
impulse
behind
it,
is
that
it...
it
seems
as
an
effort
to
sweep
aside
all
of
the
controls
within
the
executive
branch
and
the
deliberate
procedures
for
sharing
information
and,
instead,
to
radically
change
past
practices
and
allow
employees
to
take
matters
into
their
own
hands.
