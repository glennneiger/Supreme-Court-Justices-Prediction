ms.
patti
goldman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
appeal
arises
from
a
judgment
that
a
statute
of
congress
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
since
the
district
court
entered
judgment,
several
events
have
taken
place
which
have
substantially
altered
the
nature
of
this
controversy.
in
order
to
place
those
developments
in
proper
perspective,
i
want
to
begin
by
first
discussing
the
statute,
then
the
district
court
proceedings.
and,
finally,
the
recent
developments
and
the
effect
that
they
have
on
this
controversy.
the
law
at
issue
in
this
case,
section
630,
is
a
response
to
the
use
of
nondisclosure
agreements
to
impose
certain
new
obligations
on
federal
employees.
in
1983
president
reagan
directed
that
all
federal
employees
who
have
access
to
classified
information
must
sign
nondisclosure
agreements
or
risk
lose...
losing
their
security
clearances.
two
provisions
in
these
nondisclosure
agreements
became
particularly
troubling
to
congress.
the
first
is
that
the
agreements
obligated
employees
not
to
disclose
classifiable
information
as
well
as
classified
information.
while
employees
would
know
what
classified
information
is,
congress
was
concerned
that
the
term
"classifiable"
was
so
vague
employees
wouldn't
know
what
their
obligations
were
under
the
forms.
the
second
aspect
of
the
forms
that
concerned
congress
was
the
prior
authorization
requirement
which
the
appellees
applied
to
disclosures
to
members
of
congress.
and
here
congress
was
concerned
that
it
may
lose
access
to
information
that
it
needs
to
carry
out
its
legislative
functions.
congress
entered
into
negotiations
with
the
executive
branch
in
an
attempt
to
resolve
this
controversy,
but
those
negotiations
were
not
satisfactory.
accordingly,
congress
passed
this
law,
section
630,
which
prohibits
the
use
of
funds
to
require
employees
to
sign
the
two
forms
that
had
been
used,
as
well
as
any
other
nondisclosure
agreements
that
contain
certain
of
the
same
provisions.
and
there
are
two
categories
of
provisions
that
were
banned
in
section
630.
the
first
provisions,
the
first
bans,
go
to
the
information
that's
covered
by
the
forms.
congress'
concern
was
that
employees
should
know
what
their
obligations
are
under
the
forms.
so
congress
did
two
things.
it
banned
the
use
of
the
term
classifiable
and
it
specified
what
unmarked
information
can
be
covered
by
the
forms.
if
information
is
not
marked,
then
the
employee
must
know
that
the
information
is
either
classified
or
in
the
process
of
a
classification
determination.
and
this
provision
was
a
response
to
the
standards
that
had
been
offered
by
appellee
garfinkel
both
in
hearings
before
congress
and
in
several
federal
register
notices
that
attempt
to
define
what
this
term
classifiable
meant.
in
those
definitions
offered
by
appellee
garfinkel,
he
stated
that
employees
would
be
liable
if
they
know
or
reasonably
should
know
that
information
is
classified.
congress
rejected
this
630
that
the
employee
must
know
that
unmarked
information
is
covered
by
the
forms.
the
second
set--
ms.
patti
goldman
--generally,
yes.
both
in
the
executive
order
and
in
the
directives
that
have
been
issued
by
appellee
garfinkel
and
other
agencies,
classified
information
must
be
marked.
in
some
instances,
marking
takes
a
different
form.
for
example,
with
oral
communications
and
recordings,
instead
of
a
clear
marking,
there
would
be
a
statement
that
the
information
is
classified
and
anything
should
be
marked
that
comes
out
of
that
communication.
ms.
patti
goldman
yes,
in
part.
it
is
moot
as
to
all
of
the
employees
who
received
notice
that
the
term
classifiable
has
been
deleted
from
the
forms.
and
everyone
agrees
that
it
is
moot
as
to
those
employees.
there
is
a
dispute,
though,
as
to
the
proper
remedy
in
that
instance
and
also
the
extent
as
to
which
the
mootness
permeates
the
whole
case.
the
appellees
contend
that
this
court
should
affirm
the
district
court
judgment
on
grounds
of
mootness,
and
we
believe
that
is
an
inappropriate
remedy.
but
the
part
of
the
case
that
is
moot
should
be
vacated
as
moot.
and
then
the
other--
ms.
patti
goldman
--appellee
garfinkel
has
placed
a
notice
in
the
federal
register,
but
appellee
webster
has
not
as
to
the
forms
that
he
is
responsible
for.
and
a
notice
was
sent
to
individual
employees
who
signed
the
forms,
amending
their
agreements,
but
not
to
former
employees.
we
don't
know
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings
the
extent
to
which
former
employees
have
not
received
notice,
and
that
should
be
something
that
the
district
court
can
sort
out
on
a
remand
and
decide
how
much
of
the
case
is
left
and
if
there's
any
appropriate
remedy.
and
that's
what--
ms.
patti
goldman
--certainly
not.
we
agree
that
the
dispute
over
classifiable
is
largely
moot.
but
there
are
two
areas
of
this
dispute
that
we
do
not--
ms.
patti
goldman
--we
certainly
do.
we
think
that
the
district
court
should--
ms.
patti
goldman
--it
would...
well,
the
remedy
has
been
an
important
issue
in
this
case
because
the
appellees
have
asked
this
court
to
affirm.
and
we
think
that
is
the
wrong
thing
to
do
at
this
stage.
instead,
we
ask
the
court
to
vacate
the
district
court
judgment
and
remand
this
case
for
the
district
court
to
sort
out
all
the
recent
developments
that
have
taken
place
and
the
effect
that
they
have
on
this
case.
in
addition,
because
the
district
court
decided
the
constitutional
questions
before
deciding
the
statutory
ones
fully,
we
ask
this
court
to
give
the
district
court
instructions
to
follow
the
correct
order
on
the
remand.
what
we
ask
the
court
to
do
is
instruct
the
district
court
that
it
should
first
decide
the
extent
to
which
this
case
is
still
a
live
controversy
and
then
the
extent
to
which
there
are
violations.
and
only
once
it
has
reached
that
decision
should
the
district
court
decide
whether
there
are
any
violations
of
the
constitution
in
the
statute
as
it
applies.
ms.
patti
goldman
yes.
the
language
in
the
new
forms
has
no
knowledge
requirement
at
all.
the
new
forms
obligate
employees
not
to
disclose
information
that
is
either
classified,
whether
or
not
it
is
marked,
or
in
the
process
of
a
classification
determination.
but
it
is
not
just
the
forms
that
are
at
issue
here.
it
is
also
the
notices
that
were
sent
to
the
employees,
since
it
is
those
notices
that
amended
the
forms
that
they
had
signed.
ms.
patti
goldman
our
complaint
has
not
reached
the
new
forms
since
they
weren't
part
of
the--
ms.
patti
goldman
--yes.
to
the
extent
that
it
violates
subsection
(1)
we
do
have
a
problem
with
that
requirement.
but,
again,
that
would
be
something
that
would
have
to
be
sorted
out
on
remand.
we
would
have
to
amend
our
complaint
to
encompass
the
new
forms
as
well
as
the
old
and
specify
that
those
duties
also
violate
the
knowledge
requirement
of
subsection
(1).
ms.
patti
goldman
yes.
ms.
patti
goldman
but
the
employee
doesn't
know
exactly
when
that
obligation
to
make
an
inquiry
arises.
and
appellees'
brief
demonstrated...
demonstrates
how
open-ended
those
requirements
are.
appellees
define
this
reason
to
know
standard
as
any
doubt...
if
any
employee
has
any
doubt
that
information
might
be
classified,
then
he
or
she
must
check
and
consult
to
see
whether
it
is.
at
other
places
in
appellees'
briefs
they
state
that
reason
to
know
means
uncertainty.
if
an
employee
is
uncertain
as
to
the
classification
status,
he
or
she
must
check.
our
concern
is
that
these
duties
to
consult
will
apply
to
a
wide
range
of
unclassified
information
where
the
employee
doesn't
know
that
he
or
she
should--
ms.
patti
goldman
--i
don't
believe
it
has.
at
this
point
the--
ms.
patti
goldman
--yes,
we
do
think
it
is
right
because
these
individuals
have
signed
a
contract
that
first
said
classifiable
and
now
has
been
amended
to
say
know
or
reason
to
know
something
is
classified.
and
by
being
obligated
by
that
standard,
employees
are
chilled
from
making
a
whole
range
of
disclosures
of
unclassified
information
as
well
as
information
that
might
properly
be
classified.
ms.
patti
goldman
well,
in
the
context
of
this
case,
congress
said
know
when
a
reason
to
know
standard
was
before
it.
so,
congress
decided
that
there
were
two
standards,
and
it
chose
one
of
them.
if...
if
it's
really
correct
that
there
is
little
difference
between
the
two,
then
i
would
ask...
the
next
question
would
be
how
can
it
possibly
be
unconstitutional
then
for
congress
to
say
know
instead
of
reason
to
know
if
the
two
may
be
so
close
in
what
they
mean.
ms.
patti
goldman
at
this
point
we're
not
asking
the
court
to
decide
any
of
the
merits
of
either
the
statutory
or
constitutional
argument.
we
think
there's
a
controversy.
we
think
there
are
violations.
but
because
of
all
of
the
recent
developments
and
the
different
ways
that
the
parties
have
construed
them,
we
think
the
district
court
should
decide
in
the
first
instance
what
is
at
issue,
what
violations
exist
today,
what
remedies
are
appropriate.
and
then,
and
only
then,
if
there
are
violations
of
the
constitution.
ms.
patti
goldman
well,
initially
we
had
taken
the
position
that
it
was
clear
on
the
face
of
the
forms
that
there
was
a
violation
there
and
this
court
should
reach
the
statutory
and
constitutional
issues.
ms.
patti
goldman
well,
there's
so
much
disagreement
in
all
of
the
briefs
that
have
been
filed
in
this
case,
and
confusion,
if
not
on
our
part,
on
the
part
of
many
of
the
other
people
who
have
filed
briefs
that--
ms.
patti
goldman
--well,
the
reason
that
we're
here,
your
honor,
is
because
once
the
developments
took
place
the
appellees
asked
this
court
to
affirm
the
district
court
judgment
and
not
to
vacate
it.
and,
also,
we
have
a
district
court
judgment
that
is
a
sweeping
ruling
that
this
entire
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
so,
whatever
developments
took
place,
whatever
challenge...
changes
that
took
place,
the
district
court
had
decided
that
there
would
be
no
compliance
with
section
630,
it
didn't
matter,
the
entire
statute
was
unconstitutional.
ms.
patti
goldman
well,
we
have
and
we're
prepared
to
argue
that.
and
this
court
certainly
can
reach
that
since
in
our
view
there's
a
live
controversy
in
violations.
let
me
turn
then
to
the
district
court
proceedings.
ms.
patti
goldman
it
is
before
the
court,
and
we
believe
the
court
can
decide
it.
there's
a
question
of
what
might
be
the
best
remedy
in
this
situation.
we've
become
convinced
maybe
the
best
remedy
isn't
for
the
court
to
decide
it.
ms.
patti
goldman
you
can
certainly
do...
decide
the
case
or
send
it
back.
i
think
it's--
ms.
patti
goldman
--we
initially
urged
the
court
to
decide--
ms.
patti
goldman
--we
think
the
right
thing
to
do
at
this
stage
is
to
send
it
back
and
have
the
district
court
pass
on
all
the
recent--
ms.
patti
goldman
--i
think
this
court
should
decide
two
things
about
the
district
court
decision.
and
they
are,
that
the
district
court
followed
the
wrong
approach
by
deciding
the
constitutional
questions
before
the
statutory
ones,
and
that
instead
what
the
district
court
should
do
on
remand
and
should
have
done
initially
is
decide
exactly
in
what
respects
the
appellees
were
violating
section
630.
and
then
decide
whether
those
violations
implicated
constitutional
questions,
whether
the
statute
as
applied
to
those
violations
was
unconstitutional.
the
second
thing
that
we
want
this
court
to
decide,
as
the
court
certainly
can
decide,
is
that
the
district
court
erred
in
the
method
of
analysis
it
applied
because
it
assumed
that
the
president
has
exclusive
authority
over
all
national
security
and
foreign
affairs
matters.
and
that
is
in
error.
instead,
the
district
court
should
have
looked
to
the
shared
powers
that
congress
has
in
this
area
under
the
constitution,
and
to
the
method
of
analysis
employed
by
this
court
in
nixon
v.
the
administrator
of
general
services.
and
under
that
test
the
executive
branch,
which
is
challenging
the
statute,
must
introduce
evidence
that
there
is
some
impairment--
ms.
patti
goldman
--well,
we
believe
this
case
is
concrete,
and
there
is
a
live
controversy.
there
are
violations
on
the
face
of
the
new
forms
and
on
the
notices
that
have
been
sent,
and
that
the
court
can
decide
these
questions.
but
in
the
posture
of
this
case,
as
complicated
as
it
has
become,
it
may
be
more
appropriate
to
send
the
case
back
to
the
district
court
to
first...
to
decide
these
questions
in
the
first
instance.
ms.
patti
goldman
there
are
two
violations
that
exist.
one
is
the
difference
in
the
knowledge...
the
knowledge
standard.
ms.
patti
goldman
and
the
other
is
the
prior
authorization
requirement.
we
had
argued
that
the
forms
apply
a
prior
authorization
requirement
to
disclosures
to
members
of
congress.
the
new
forms
and
the
notices--
ms.
patti
goldman
--yes.
i
didn't
get
to
that
when
i
was
explaining--
ms.
patti
goldman
--the
statute,
but
there
are
two
subsections
that
prevent
nondisclosure
agreements
from
imposing
a
prior
authorization
requirement
on
disclosures
that
employees
have
a
right
to
make
to
members
of
congress.
ms.
patti
goldman
i
think
it's
the
reverse.
that
employees
have
rights
through
other
statutes.
and
all
that
section
630
did
is
preserve
the
rights
that
exist
from
some
other
source.
what
section
630
says
is
that
if
an
employee
has
the
right
to
give
information
to
congress,
nondisclosure
agreements
cannot
require
that
employee
to
obtain
permission
before
exercising
that
right.
and
on
that
point
there
is
no
dispute.
all
of
the
parties
agree
that
that's
the
reading
of
the
term.
ms.
patti
goldman
there
may
or
may
not
be.
the
district
court
did
not
focus
on
the
prior
authorization
requirement
because
the
appellees
were
using
the
two
forms
that
are
listed
by
number
in
section
630.
there...
we
had
put
some
evidence
in
the
record,
but
the
district
court
made
no
findings
on
that
point.
and
it
has
become
more
important
since
the
appellees
discontinued
using
those
two
numbered
forms
because
now
we
must
look
at
the
forms
to
determine
the
extent
to
which
they
violate
each
of
the
subsections
in
the
law.
ms.
patti
goldman
yes,
it
was.
ms.
patti
goldman
we--
ms.
patti
goldman
--we
believe--
ms.
patti
goldman
--we
did
change
our
mind.
ms.
patti
goldman
in
our
opening
brief
we
also
asked
the
court
to
reverse.
ms.
patti
goldman
it
was
in
our
reply
brief
that
we
backtracked
and
we
said
the
court
should
either
reverse
or
vacate
and
remand.
ms.
patti
goldman
yes.
after
reading
the
six
other
briefs
that
were
filed
in
this
case
it
became
clear
that
there
is
a
lot
of
confusion
about
what
has
happened
since
the
district
court
judgment
and
the
impact
that
it
has
on
this
case.
and
most
of
what
the
briefs
rely
on
is
not
in
the
record
in
this
case,
but
in
forms
that
have
been
developed
since
and
briefing
materials,
notices
that
have
been
sent
out.
ms.
patti
goldman
we
certainly
believe
there's
enough
on
this
record
for
the
court
to
reach
all
of
the--
ms.
patti
goldman
--well,
the
court
would
certainly
have--
ms.
patti
goldman
--we
agree
with
you.
ms.
patti
goldman
the
only
basis
would
be
that
the
parties
and
the
amici
that
have
filed
briefs
have
viewed
that
term
differently
and
have
relied
on
evidence
that's
not
in
the
record.
and
if
this
court
would
want
to
have
the
district
court
sort
it
all
out,
that
would
certainly
be
appropriate.
we
believe
that
there's
plenty
here
for
the
court
to
decide,
but
it
may
be
that
you
would
choose
not
to.
ms.
patti
goldman
certainly.
ms.
patti
goldman
well,
that--
ms.
patti
goldman
--well,
that
was
the
problem
with
the
district
court
opinion.
the
district
court
didn't
focus
on
any
of
the
provisions.
the
district
court
assumed
that
there
was
a
violation
of
this
law
because
the
appellees
used
certain
numbered
forms
that
are
listed
by
number
in
the
statute.
the
district
court
didn't
focus
on
particular
violations.
and
the
fundamental
error
here
in
the
district
court
opinion
is
that
it
is
a
sweeping
declaration
of
unconstitutionality
without
locking
at
the
particular
pieces
of
this
statute
and
deciding
whether
they
impair
the
executive
branch
in
some
way,
based
on
evidence
in
the
record,
and
if
they
do,
whether
there
is
some
overriding
need
for
the
statute.
ms.
patti
goldman
and
that's--
ms.
patti
goldman
--that
is
what
we're
asking
this
court
to
do.
ms.
patti
goldman
that
is
what
we
want
this
court
to
do,
is
look
at
the
approach
that
the
district
court
took
and...
and
explain
exactly
why
it
is
in
error.
and
let
me
explain
what
evidence
was
in
the
record
below
on
this
point
because
i
think
it
illustrates
how
erroneous
that
decision
was.
in
challenging
the
statute
below,
the
only
evidence
that
the
appellees
introduced
was
an
affidavit
by
appellee
webster.
and
that
affidavit
makes
two
assertions.
the
first
is
that
disclosures
of
classified
intelligence
information
may
harm
national
security.
and
the
second
is
nondisclosure
agreements
may
assist
the
executive
branch
in
preventing
those
disclosures.
we
have
no
dispute
with
either
of
those
propositions.
but
they
don't
shed
any
light
on
the
particular
provisions
of
section
630.
in
fact,
that
affidavit
says
nothing
about
a
knowledge
standard,
a
prior
authorization
requirement
for
congressional
disclosures,
or
the
term
classifiable.
the
district
court
didn't
rely
on
any
evidence,
that
evidence
or
any
other.
he
decided
that
the
president
has
exclusive
authority
over
national
security
information
and
that
congress
has
no
role
to
play
in
regulating
disclosure
of
national
security
information.
in
fact,
the
focus
in
the
district
court
was
on
the
term
classifiable.
and
the
same
district
judge
who
decided
this
case
declared
that
term
unconstitutionally
vague
two
months
after
he
issued
this
decision.
he
enjoined
the
use
of
this
term,
although
he
decided
congress
has
no
power
to
do
the
same.
the
first
error,
therefore,
in
the
district
court
decision
is
the
assumption
that
congress
has
no
power
in
this
area.
and
once
it's
recognized
that
congress
has
numerous
powers
under
the
constitution,
such
as
the
lawmaking
power,
the
appropriations
power,
the
power
to
regulate
the
land
and
naval
forces,
et
cetera,
then
it
becomes
clear
this
is
an
area
of
shared
powers
and
the
proper
test
is
the
one
set
forth
in
nixon
v.
gsa.
in
that
case,
this
court
said
that
the
party
challenging
a
statute,
or
the
branch
challenging
a
statute,
must
show
that
it
impairs
their
ability
to
carry
out
their
constitutional
functions.
here
the
executive
branch
has
not
made
any
showing
that
it
is
impaired
by
the
terms
in
section
630.
the
only
evidence
was
the
webster
affidavit
that
didn't
go
to
the
particular
terms
in
section
630.
and
it's
unlikely
that
the
executive
branch
could
make
such
a
showing,
given
the
nature
of
this
statute.
section
630--
ms.
patti
goldman
--not
necessarily.
ms.
patti
goldman
well,
not
necessarily
for
two
reasons.
first--
ms.
patti
goldman
--i
don't
believe
so,
because
section
630
only
goes
to
terms
in
nondisclosure
agreements.
a
reason
to
know
standard
may
not
be
imposed
through
a
nondisclosure
agreement
under
this
law.
section
630
does
not
deal
with
the
larger
question
of
whether
employees
can
be
punished
if
they
disclose
information
when
they
have
reason
to
know
it
may
be
classified
through
some
other
authority.
congress
did
not
limit
the
executive
branch's
ability
to
decide
who
can
have
a
security
clearance
or
who
can
have...
access
to
certain
sensitive
information.
ms.
patti
goldman
congress
was
very
concerned
about
these
contracts.
three
million
employees--
ms.
patti
goldman
--well,
that's
not
the
question
here.
the
question
is
whether
congress
can
make
a
decision
that
certain
obligations
should
not
be
imposed.
ms.
patti
goldman
well,
that's
not--
ms.
patti
goldman
--that's
not
exactly
correct
because
under
section--
ms.
patti
goldman
--it
is
correct
in
that
congress
limited
certain
obligations
under
nondisclosure
agreements.
if
an
employee
knows
that
information
is
classified,
he
or
she
can
be
punished
under
the
agreements
for
negligence.
ms.
patti
goldman
then
he
or
she
can
only
be
punished
if
the
executive
branch
is
using
some
other
authority.
the
contracts
cannot
be
the
basis
for
the
punishment.
ms.
patti
goldman
well,
there
may
not
be--
ms.
patti
goldman
--if
the
employee
has
left.
ms.
patti
goldman
but
the
concerns
that
are
raised
in
the
executive
branch
brief
here
is
access
to
the
national
security
information.
ms.
patti
goldman
well,
if
they
know,
they
have
all
the
obligations
of
the
agreements.
ms.
patti
goldman
if...
if
the
executive
branch
would
have
some
other
stick,
for
example,
a
new
position,
the
executive
branch
would
certainly
have
control
over
whether--
ms.
patti
goldman
--well,
the
statute
does
use
the
term
policy
but
the
legislative
history
in
this
area
is
clear
that
congress
was
concerned
with
contracts.
and
in
this
instance
we
believe
it
would
appropriate...
it
would
be
appropriate
to
construe
the
term
policy
in
accordance
with
the
entire
legislative
history--
ms.
patti
goldman
--well,
it
doesn't
say
rules
or
regulations
or
executive
orders
and
it's
not
exactly
clear
on
that
point.
ms.
patti
goldman
we
don't
think
it
should
be--
ms.
patti
goldman
--well,
there
may
be
some--
ms.
patti
goldman
--well,
that's
not
what
this
statute
does,
but
if
it
did,
congress--
ms.
patti
goldman
--congress
would
certainly
be
entitled
to
make
a
judgment
that
where
information
is
not
marked,
the
executive
branch
should
bear
the
burden
of
insuring
employees
know
rather
than
those
employees
of
checking--
ms.
patti
goldman
--well,
the
test
that
would
be
applied
would
be
the
balancing
test.
there
may
be
some
instances
where--
ms.
patti
goldman
--it
would
tie
the
executive
branch's
hands.
ms.
patti
goldman
yes,
it
may,
unless
the
executive
branch
can
show
that
its
hands
are
tied
under
the
test
in
nixon
v.
gsa.
and
then
those
aspects,
those
instances
where
the
statute
would
do
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
i
would
like
to
save
some
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
patti
goldman
i
think
it
would
be
useful
if
i
explained
what
we
challenged
and
what's
relevant
now
in
this
issue
of
compliance.
we
challenged
the
executive
branch's
noncompliance
with
section
630
because
the
executive
branch
required
employees
to
sign
the
forms
listed
in
section
630.
at
least
49,000
of
those
forms
were
signed
during
the
ban.
the
executive
branch
is
arguing
now
that
it
is
complying
with
section
630,
and
the
question
is
what's
happened
with
those
49,000
people.
how
have
those
forms
been
brought
into
compliance,
either
through
the
notice
or
by
having
those
employees
sign
the
new
forms?
and
that
is
why
the
subsections
of
section
630
are
now
essential
for
the
government's
compliance
argument.
there
is
no
longer
a
violation
only
if
those
forms
comply
with
all
of
the
provisions
of
section
630.
i
want
to
close
with
just
one
observation,
and
that
is
the
effect
that
this
judgment
has
had
on
the
cooperation
that
mr.
kneedler
says
is
so
essential
between
the
branches.
the
district
judge,
by
declaring
that
the
executive
branch
has
such
sweeping
power,
has
impeded
the
kind
of
accommodation
that
should
take
place
in
this
kind
of
a
controversy.
and
we
hope
that
if
this
court
wipes
that
decision
off
the
books,
that...
that
the
accommodation
would
follow.
