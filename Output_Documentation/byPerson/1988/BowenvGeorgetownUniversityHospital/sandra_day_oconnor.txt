mr.
lazarus,
i
guess
if
we
were
to
find
that
the
medicare
act
itself
prohibits
retroactive
rulemaking
in
this
instance
we
wouldn't
have
to
go
on
and
reach
the
apa
question,
would
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
lazarus,
it
seems
that
you're
arguing
that
the
apa
allows
retroactive
rulemaking
any
time
it
isn't,
in
your
view,
arbitrary
and
capricious.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
just
seems
to
make
retroactive
rulemaking
totally
available.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
facts
of
this
case
don't
lend
themselves
readily
to
supporting
the
rule,
even
under
your
view.
do
they?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
to
avoid
the
effect
of
failing
to,
to
apply
with
the
apa
in
the
first
instance?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
sutter,
do
you
take
the
position
today
then
that
no
retroactive
rulemaking
is
allowed
under
the
apa?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
defines
the
exceptions
then,
and
how
do
you
derive
those
from
the
plain
language?
