justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
lazarus,
before
you
go
further
with
the
facts,
i
presume
that
the
secretary
could
have
amended
the
rule
in
such
a
fashion
as
to
eliminate
the
unfair
disadvantage
without
eliminating
what
he
regarded
as
the
unfair
advantage,
in
which
case
there
would
have
been
nobody
to
challenge
the
retroactive
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
you
mentioned
that
it
unfairly
disadvantaged
some
people
and
unfairly
advantaged
others.
all
we're
really
fighting
about
here
are
the
people
that
you
assert
it
unfairly
advantaged,
because
you
could
have
taken
care
of
the
people
that
it
unfairly
disadvantaged.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
secretary
could
have
issued
the
rule
eliminating
the
unfair
disadvantage,
not
the
unfair
advantage,
and
there
would
have
been
no
one
to
challenge
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
it.
but
the
secretary
could
have
split
it
in
two
and
said--
justice
antonin
scalia
--my
point
is
that
we
don't
have
to
find
for
you,
in
order
to
enable
the
unfair
disadvantaged
to
be
eliminated.
all
we're
fighting
about
here
is
the
unfair
advantage.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
secretary
can
do
all
sorts
of
things,
so
long
as
it
doesn't
hurt
anybody.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
lazarus,
when
the
government
quotes
section
551
in
its
brief
it
unfortunately
makes
something
of
an
ellipsis.
it
just
quotes
the
first
portion
of,
of
section
551(4).
it
leaves
out
the
part
which
says,
"and
includes
the
approval
or
prescription,
not
in
the
future,
but
for
the
future,
the
approval
or
prescription
for
the
future
of
rates,
wages.
"
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say,
"costs
or
accounting
or
practices
bearing
on
any
of
the
foregoing.
"
which
seems
to
me
exactly
what
we
have
here.
it
uses
the
phrase
there
"for
the
future".
you
make
a
lot
in
your
brief
of
the
fact
that
it
says,
in
the
future,
in
the
first
part.
it
does
indeed.
but
the
second
part
of
551(4)
says
quite
clearly,
for
the
future,
prescription
for
the
future.
how
does
that
affect
your
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
the
point
of
that
comment.
it
only
applies
to
icc
proceedings?
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
dealing
with
past
transactions
in
prescribing
rules
for
the
future,
that
may
mean
from
now
on
you
will
treat
past
transactions
in
this
fashion.
but
up
to
now
you
have
to
have
treated
them
the
way
they've
been
treated.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
sure
you
do,
but
i
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
if
that's
what
future
effect
means,
that
is
it
has
some
effect
in
the
future
though
it
also
has
effect
in
the
past,
how
do
you
distinguish
a
rule
from
an
adjudication?
doesn't
an
adjudication
have
a
future
effect?
isn't
an
agency
under,
under
our
decisions
disabled
from
going
back
on
prior
adjudications
unreasonably?
isn't
that
arbitrary
or
capricious
action?
doesn't
in
that
sense
an
adjudication
have
a
future
effect?
so,
it
has
a
future
effect
and
it
has
a
past
effect.
you
tell
us
rules
are
the
same.
they
have
some
future
effect,
but
they
also
have
past
effect.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
congress
could
have
done
it.
congress
could
have
pulled
his
coal
out
of
the
fire,
if,
if
that
was
a
problem.
and
in
that...
you
make
a
lot
in
your
brief
about,
well,
it's
so
necessary,
just
as
it's
necessary
for
congress
to
legislate
retroactively
now
and
then.
but
if
congress
can't
legislate
retroactively
there's
no
remedy.
there
is
a
remedy
here.
if
the
secretary
can't
issue
a
retroactive
rule
he
can
go
to
congress
and
say,
enact
a
retroactive
statute,
can't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
situation
is
quite
different
from
the
legislative
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
no
question
that
under
the,
under
the
provision
of,
of
the
subject
legislation,
the
secretary
could
have
recomputed
for
each
of
those
individual
hospitals
the
charges
and
found
that
the
regulations
didn't
provide
a
fair
return
in
this
situation.
there's
no
doubt
he
could
have
done
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
both
sides
acknowledge
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
going
to
address
the
point
of
what
regulation
takes
over,
if
the
agency
cannot
issue
a
new
one
retroactively?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
leaving
aside
your
retroactive
argument,
which
just
gets
us
back
into
the
main
problem,
i
had
always
thought
that
a
rule
could
only
be
amended
by
a
rule.
you
can't
change
a
rule
by
an
adjudication.
and
if
you
haven't
amended
the
rule
by
another
valid
rule,
it
isn't
a
matter
of
reinstating
the
prior
regulation.
the
prior
regulation
subsists.
isn't
that
simply
the
state
of
the
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
although
the
agency
can
only
decide
one
thing,
it
may
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
this
argument
of
yours
hinge
upon
your
retroactivity
argument?
if
we
reject
your
retroactivity
argument
then
can
we
safely
assume
that
the
prior
rule
was
the
rule
that
had
to
be
applied?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
sutter,
let
me
come
back
to
the
problem
of
the
secretary
revising
the
regulation
in
order
to
give
more
money
to
some
people.
i
suppose
even
if,
even
if
it
was
an
improper
revision
of
the
regulation
retroactively,
there'd
be
nobody
to
challenge
it,
so
he
could
do
it
with
impunity.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
he
wanted
to
be
technically
correct,
i
suppose
he
could,
what,
present
a,
in
an
appropriations
bill
a
little,
a
little
line
that
says--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what,
what
opposition
would
that
likely
confront
in
congress,
if
the
secretary's
in
favor
of
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
also
be
strange
to
say
that
the
regulations
shall
provide
for
the
issuance
of
regulations,
that's
rather
a
strange--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
sutter,
depending
on
what
the
procedural
deficiency
is,
there's
also
some
room
for
courts
of
appeals
to
remand
to
the
agency
without
setting
aside
the
rule,
isn't
there?
i
mean,
frequently
when
what
is
lacking
is
a
sufficiently
precise
statement
of
basis
and
purpose,
the
court
of
appeals
will
simply
remand
for
a
more
precise
statement.
justice
antonin
scalia
considering
the
rulemaking
as
still
being
preceding
and
not
yet,
not
yet
terminated.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
happens
quite
often,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
--why,
why,
would
that
be
so
unfair,
to
get
the
money
back?
justice
antonin
scalia
they,
they,
they
would
not
have
relied
on
anything,
the
secretary's
ruling
came
after
they
had
made
their
plans
about
how
much
they
had
to
charge
for
medical
services
anyway,
right?
it
didn't
affect
their
primary
conduct.
they
were
just
given
out
of
the
blue
money
that
they
thought
they
weren't
going
to
get.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
said
it
affected
only
past
conduct.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
what
we're
talking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
we're
talking
about
throwing
away.
that
would
not
have
affected--
justice
antonin
scalia
--on,
it
would
not
have
affected
their
primary
conduct
at
all,
they
would
have
gotten
a
windfall,
and
the
secretary
would
be
taking
back
their
windfall.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
it's
hard
for
you
to
be
hardhearted
to
hospitals,
but
it
seems
to
have
been
a
windfall.
justice
antonin
scalia
only
one
error,
that's
all.
he
just
didn't
go
through
the
rulemaking
proceeding,
is
the
only
thing
he
did
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
the
statute
reads
the
way
you
say,
why
do
you
have
to
narrow
it
to
circumstances?
you're
not
reading
the
statute
to
say
you
can
only
do
curative
rulemaking.
you're
saying
you
can
do,
you
can
make
rules
retroactive
generally.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
presume
the
rules
would
be
the
same
as
for
retroactive
adjudication.
we've
had
some,
some
cases
about
when
you
can't
change
the
law
after
the
fact
too
promptly,
probably
be
the
same
for
rulemaking,
wouldn't
it?
