chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
87-1097,
otis
r.
bowen
v.
georgetown
university
hospital.
mr.
lazarus,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
sutter.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
section
is
this,
mr.
sutter?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that's
a
part
of
section
1861.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then
for
that
you
rely
on
the
phrase,
to
be
recognized
as
reasonable,
in
another
part
of
1861?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
do
you
think
the
definition
of
rules
set
out
in
that
definitional
section
of
the
apa
is
kind
of
the
be-all
and
end-all,
that
it
meant
to
just
describe
the
full
length
and
breadth
of
anything
that
a
rule
could
do?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
congress
provided
that
the
secretary
of
energy
shall
by
such
and
such
a
date
issue
regulations
prohibiting
anyone
from
charging
more
than
80
cents
a
gallon
for
gasoline,
and
the
secretary
does
not
promulgate
those
regulations
by
that
date,
he
promulgates
them
20
days
later,
but
he
includes
in
that
rule
a
statement
that
they
shall
be
effective
from
the
date
that
congress
said
the
regulation
should
be
in
place,
is
that
okay?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
secretary
doesn't
want
to
waive
it.
so
what
if
the
secretary,
after
judge
oberdorfer's
decision,
had
sued
some
of
the
hospitals
who
had
benefited
from
the
regulation
saying,
we
now
think,
we
have
a
court
decision
saying
this
is
invalid,
we
want
to
get
our
money
back
from
you.
now,
presumably
the
hospitals
would
have
a
right
to
litigate
that
question,
because
they're
not
bound
by
dcha.
but
supposing
that
the
other
court
agreed
with
judge
oberdorfer,
that
this
regulation
was
invalid,
can't
the
secretary
then
get
the
money
back?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
balancing--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sutter.
mr.
lazarus,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lazarus.
the
case
is
submitted.
