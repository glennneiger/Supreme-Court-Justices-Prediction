mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
the
authority
of
a
federal
agency
to
promulgate
a
retroactive
rule.
our
position
can
be
simply
stated.
a
retroactive
rule
is
generally
valid
unless
the
agency's
decision
to
impose
the
rule
retroactively
is
arbitrary
and
capricious.
unlike
the
d.c.
circuit,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
bars
virtually
all
retroactive
rules
regardless
of
their
reasonableness,
nor
do
we
believe
that
the
medicare
act
prohibits
all
retroactive
cost
limit
rules
in
every
circumstance.
instead,
in
our
view,
retroactive
cost
limit
rules
are
valid
in
two
different
ways
under
the
medicare
act,
each
sufficient
by
itself
to
support
the
rule
struck
down
by
the
lower
court.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
technically
the
court
would
not
have
to.
we
would
urge
the
court
to
address
both
questions.
the
administrative
procedure
act
issue
is
by
far
the
more
important
issue
decided
by
the
lower
court.
the
d.c.
circuit
is
the
most
important
circuit
for
administrative
law
questions,
and
it
was
decided
by
that
court,
and
there's
no
reason
why
the
court
logically
has
to
address
one
rather
than
the
other.
so
the
court
technically
does
not
have
to,
but
we
would
urge
the
court
to,
and
for
the
reasons
in
our
brief,
present,
we
don't
absolutely
think
the
medicare
act
itself
does
prohibit
such
rules.
the
retroactive
rule
challenged
in
this
case--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--yes.
the
court
does
not
have
to,
we
would
urge
the
court.
the
retroactive
rule
challenged
in
this
case
finds
its
genesis
in
the
1981
determination
of
the
secretary
to
make
a
wholly
prospective
change
in
the
medicare
act
cost
limit
rules.
at
the
time
relevant
to
this
litigation,
the
medicare
act
allowed
for
reimbursement
of
providers
of
health
services
for
the
reasonable
costs
of
their
services
to
medicare
beneficiaries.
to
that
end,
the
act
authorized
the
secretary
to
promulgate
cost
limit
rules
based
on
the
estimates
of
the
costs
necessary
for
the
efficient
delivery
of
health
services.
in
1981,
the
secretary
determined
that
his
then-existing
rule
regarding
wage
costs
promulgated
in
1979
required
adjustment.
the
database
upon
which
that
rule
was
based
did
not
accurately
reflect
differences
in
wage
costs
in
different
parts
of
the
country.
as
a
result
the
rule
unfairly
disadvantaged
certain
providers
in
certain
geographic
areas.
those
providers
were
receiving
inadequate
reimbursement
under
the
medicare
act
while
other
providers
were
receiving
excessive
reimbursement.
because
the
secretary
considered
the
modifications
necessary
in
the
database
to
be
of
a
minor
technical
nature,
he
published
the
final
revised
rule
without
first
providing
for
public
notice
and
comment.
respondents
filed
suit,
and
in
1983
a
federal
district
court
invalidated
the
1981
rule
on
procedural
grounds.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
the
secretary
could
have
approached
it
all
kinds
of
different
ways.
the
question
is--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--well,
not
actually,
i
think,
under
the
way
that
the
respondents
would
see
the
case.
they
would
suggest
that
any
kind
of
retroactivity,
and
if
the
secretary
is
without
authority
to
make
any
kind
of
retroactive
changes
they
would
have
been,
in
other
words
confined
to
the
1979
rule,
the
secretary
should
have
assigned
recoupment
from
the
others.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
no,
it
was
the
same
rule.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
what,
provided
two
different
rules
for
two
different...
the
secretary
is
certainly
within
his
discretion
to
announce
one
rule
applying
to
the
entire--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--well,
i
think
we're
actually
fighting
about,
about
both,
particularly
to
the
extent
that
we're
dealing
with
the
broader
questions
of
the
secretary's
authority
in
the
future
to
promulgate
retroactive
rules.
if
the
secretary
in
the
future
decides
that
he
is
incapable
of
promulgating
a
retroactive
rule,
then
other
providers
in
this
case
who
relied
justifiably
on
the
1979
rule
would,
i
think,
not
have
redress,
and
instead
the
secretary
would
have
had
to
seek
recoupment
against
them.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
right.
and
the
question
still
remains
whether
or
not
it's
within
the
secretary's
discretion,
i
will
grant
you,
to
decide
to
treat
them
all
alike,
under
one
rule.
the
district
court
invalidated
the
rule
concluding,
the
1981
rule,
that
the
apa
required
prior
notice
and
comment.
the
district
court,
however,
specifically
declined
respondents'
request
that
it
order
the
secretary
to
reimburse
them
pursuant
to
the
1979
prior
rule.
the
court
instead
remanded
the
matter
to
the
secretary
for
further
proceedings.
on
remand,
following
a
period
of
notice
and
comment,
the
secretary
promulgated
a
new
rule
in
1984
that
was
identical
in
substance
to
the
1981
rule.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
he
did
reimburse
them
under
the
1979
rule
as
a
matter
of
administrative
grace.
but
in
doing
so
he
made
it
clear
that
that
determination
was
subject
to
reopening,
if
he
subsequently
decided
that
the
appropriate
cost
limit
rule
was
one
that
excluded
federal
wage
data.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
i
think
he
has.
in
fiscal
intermediary's
bid,
subsequently--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--a
copy
of
the
letter
showing
our
qualification
is
included,
appended
to
our
reply
brief,
showing
that
we
explicitly
at
the
time
they
were
reimbursed
pursuant
to
the
1979
rule
it
was
made
explicit
that
if
the
secretary
subsequently
determined--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--that's
right.
that's
my
understanding.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
administrative
grace
to
get
things
going.
but
it
was
not--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--well
it
wasn't,
it
was
basically
to
keep
the
program
moving.
on
remand,
the
same
rule,
the
1984
rule,
is
identical
in
substance
to
the
'81
rule.
but
it
had
an
effective
date
when
it
came
out
in
'84,
more
than
30
days
after
the
date
of
promulgation,
and
it
applies
to
cost
reporting
periods
beginning
in
july
1981
and
ending
in
october
1982,
the
time
at
which
superseding
statutory
regulatory
schemes
became
effective.
respondents
were
among
the
few
providers
to
receive
less
reimbursement
under
the
retroactive
rule,
brought
suit
arguing
that
it
was
invalid
because
of
its
retroactivity.
the
district
court
agreed,
narrowly
concluding
that
the
statutory
interest
served
by
retroactivity
did
not
warrant
the
imposition
of
the
burdens
imposed
on
respondents
by
a
retroactive
rule.
the
d.c.
circuit
affirmed,
but
did
not
so
narrowly
grant
its
decision.
that
court
instead
concluded
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
bars
virtually
all
retroactive
rules
by
defining
them
in
terms
of
their
future
effect.
the
court
also
concluded
that
retroactive
cost
limit
rules
were
not
within
the
secretary's
general
rulemaking
authority
under
the
medicare
act,
nor
the
court
found
were
such
rules
within
the
secretary's
authority
under
the
retroactive
corrective
adjustment
provisions
of
that
act,
known
as
clause
(ii).
we
believe
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
its
judgment,
should
be
reversed
for
two
independent
reasons.
first,
because
the
1984
rule
is
a
valid
exercise
of
the
secretary's
general
rulemaking
authority
under
the
medicare
act,
and
second,
because
it
is
valid
exercise
for
the
secretary's
authority
under
clause
(ii),
which
provides
and
authorizes
the
secretary
to
promulgate
regulations
for
the
making
of
retroactive
corrective
adjustments.
the
most
important
and
the
most
sweeping
aspect
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
also
that
part
which
we
believe
is
most
clearly
wrong.
the
administrative
procedure
act
does
not
bar
all
retroactive
rules.
the
language
upon
which
the
court
of
appeals
relies
which
defines
a
rule
in
terms
of
its
future
effect
does
not
speak
to
the
retroactivity
issue
at
all.
that
language
simply
refers
to
when
a
rule
applies,
not
to
what
transactions,
whether
past
or
present,
applies.
in
other
words,
a
rule
is
a
statement
of
law
that
is
not
applied
in
the
same
proceeding
in
which
it
is
announced.
it
applies
in
a
future
proceeding,
for
example
in
an
adjudication.
as
said
in
our
brief--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--i
think
it
doesn't
affect
our
case.
that
language
in
the
second
part,
to
the
extent
that
it's
anything
different,
was
added
pursuant
to
some
testimony
about
icc
proceedings.
there
was
a
question
about
whether
certain
icc
ratemaking
proceedings
would
constitute
a
rule
or
not.
and
because
there
was
not
unanimity
on
that
question,
that
particular
language
was
added.
and
i
think
more
importantly,
if
you
look
at
the
house
report--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--no.
but
let
me
get
to
the...
that
was
just
basically
the
origin
of
that
language,
which
was
dealing
with
a
discreet
problem.
but
apart
from
that,
the
most,
i
think,
pertinent
thing,
if
you
look
at
the
house
report
where
they
added
the
terms,
future
effect,
the
house
report
specifically
states
that
it
was,
we
think,
not
intended
to
bar
the
kind
of
rule
at
issue
here.
and
the
words
they
use
in
describing
future
effect
i
think
equate
future
effect
in
a
way
which
both
shows
that
it
wasn't
intended
to
bar
retroactive
rules
and
shows
that
the
language
"for
the
future"
doesn't
mean
anything
different.
in
the
house
report,
it's
on
footnote
1,
i
think
it's
cited
in
our
brief.
but
let
me
just
read
you
the
pertinent
language.
it
says,
"the
phrase
"future
effect"
does
not
preclude
agency's
from
considering.
"
and
that's
a
separate
question,
"and
so
far
as
legally
authorized
from
dealing
with
past
transactions
in
prescribing
rules
for
the
future.
"
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
we
think
the
better
reading,
though--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--and
i
think
there
are
other
factors
in
the
legislative
history.
the
fact
that
congress
considered
bills
which
would
have
explicitly
barred
retroactive
rules
and
decided
not
to
include
that
language,
and
we
have
the
excerpt
during
the
legislative
hearings
showing
that
being
discussed,
and
showing
a
distinction
being
drawn
between
effectiveness
and
retroactivity
and
a
notion
that
there
was
a
problem
with
barring
retroactive
rules,
particularly
a
problem
because
of
the
curative
nature
of
the
rules.
one
could
read
these
things,
as
obviously
respondents
do,
differently.
we
think
the
better
reading,
and
certainly
a
reasonable
reading,
is
that,
and
it's
really
unreasonable,
we
believe,
to
assume
to
the
contrary.
retroactive
rules
were
a
traditional
aspect
of
administrative
practice,
rare,
but
appropriate
in
discreet
circumstances,
before
the
apa
was
enacted,
and
they
have
been
ever
since.
no
court
until
the
d.c.
circuit
has
ever
suggested
that
the
words
"future
effect"
has--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--no
court...
well,
actually
the
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
ohio.
but
i
think
there's
no,
it's
not
been
litigated
a
lot.
there
is
some
language,
however,
in
justice
harlan's
opinion
in
wyman-gordon
where
he,
i
think,
adopts
precisely
our
view
of
it.
now,
there
was
a
dissenting
opinion
but
it
was
not
a
matter
which
was
being
disputed
with
the
majority
at
all.
on
that
part
of
the
case
i
think
he
was
in
virtual
agreement.
he
draws
both
the
distinctions
that
we're
drawing,
both
future
effect
referring
to
future
effectiveness
and
a
rule
being
something
that
is
applied
in
a
different
proceeding
in
which--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--but
that's
the
purpose
of
the
definition
provision
in
the
<apa>
[=
apa].
it
wasn't
designed
to
prohibit
certain
kinds
of
rules.
it
was
designed
to
describe
generally
what
rules
are.
so
there's
nothing
illogical
or
anomalous
about
the
notion
that
most,
that
rules
generally
have
future
effect.
the
provision
just
wasn't
intended
to
say,
certain
kinds
of
rules
are
fine,
certain
kinds
of
rules
aren't
fine.
it
was
designed
to
generally
describe
what
a
rule
is,
to
codify
and
confirm
what
had
been
administrative
practice.
when
the
words,
justice
scalia,
"future
effect"
were
added
in
the
house,
when
it
was
proposed
over
in
the
senate,
the
senate
didn't
consider
it
to
have
made
any
kind
of
significant
substantive
change.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well
they
only...
they
have,
they
have
an
ongoing
future
effect
in
terms
of
effectiveness,
while
adjudication
is
different.
but
i
think
it's
more
important
to
realize
that
there
are
many
different
ways,
as
this
court
has
realized,
to
distinguish
rulemaking
adjudication,
each
one
has
its
exceptions.
there
is
no
real
bright
line
rule.
but
i
think
that
the
most
significant
one,
and
the
one
that
is
relevant
for
this
case
is
the
notion
that
a
rule
is
not
applied
in
the
same
proceeding
which
is
then
announced,
while
an
adjudication
is.
and
that's
the
handle
which
justice
harlan
also
focused
on
in
wyman-gordon.
as
set
out
more
fully
in
our
brief,
both
the
language,
both
the
structure
and
legislative
history
support
our
view.
there
are
two
places
in
the
legislative
history
that
we
believe
discuss
directly
the
retroactivity
issue,
both
the
house
report
and
the
attorney
general's
manual
on
administrative
procedure,
each
of
which
we
believe
is
consistent
with
our
view.
the
attorney
general's
manual
on
page
37.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
that's
right.
and
it
certainly--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--well
no,
we
don't
think
it
will
be
totally
available.
in
fact,
as
we've
seen,
no
court
has
before
held
it
was
barred,
and
they
are
rare.
it's
rarely
done,
because
on
fairness,
which
is
typically
associated
with
retroactive
rules,
makes
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard
a
very
significant
hurdle
for
the
secretary
to
overcome.
and
all
we're
asking
in
this
case
is
an
opportunity
to
show
the
court
of
appeals
that
this
rule
is
not
arbitrary
and
capricious.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
we
think
that--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--no,
we
think
that
this
is
a
very
good
case
for
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard,
because
the
respondents
incurred
all
of
their
costs
prior
to
the
time
at
which
the
1981
was
first
invalidated
on
procedural
grounds.
therefore,
the
rule
that
they
had
to
rely
on
was
the
'81
rule.
in
fact,
if
the
secretary
had
not
promulgated
a
retroactive
rule,
it
would
have
had
many
of
the
same
problems
of
unfairness,
because
all
those
other
providers
who
relied
on
the
1981
rule,
to
their
advantage--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--that's
true.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
but
we
believe
that
congress,
when
it
delegates
general
rulemaking
authority
to
an
agency,
it
includes
the
authority
in
discreet
circumstances
to
deal
with,
to
impose
retroactive
rules,
knowing
that
the
kinds
of
concerns
that
one
has
with
retroactivity
can
be
addressed
through
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
review.
in
the
general
rulemaking
provision
of
the
medicare
act,
congress
gave
the
secretary
full
power
to
promulgate
rules.
we
think
that
it's
essentially
full
legislative
power,
which
would
include
in
certain
very
discreet
circumstances
retroactive
rules.
we're
not
saying
that
all
retroactive
rules
are
valid.
we're
not
saying
that
all
retroactive
cost
limit
rules
are
valid.
all
we're
asking
for
is
an
opportunity
to
show
that
in
this
case
the
types
of
unfairness
concerns
are
not
really
implicated,
and
that
this
rule
is
for
that
reason
not
arbitrary
and
capricious.
respondents
notably
do
not
rely
heavily
on
the
court
of
appeals'
construction
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
but
instead
rely
principally
on
the
argument
that
the
medicare
act,
wholly
apart
from
the
administrative
procedure
act,
bars
retroactive
cost
limit
rules.
the
problem
with
their
analysis
is
twofold.
first,
we
don't
believe
that
anything
in
the
language
of
the
statute
states
that
cost
limit
rules
must
be
prospective,
and
second,
the
legislative
history
upon
which
they
rely
does
not
speak
to
the
type
of
retroactive
rule
at
issue
in
this
case,
which
is
merely
curative
in
nature.
the
statutory
language,
which
is
in
section
1395x(v)(1)(a),
reproduced
on
pages
2
and
3
of
our
brief,
does
not
have
any
kind
of
a
hint
of
a
prospectivity
requirement.
it
states
broadly
that
the
secretary
may
promulgate
cost
limit
rules
based
on
estimates
of
the
costs
necessary
in
the
efficient
delivery
of
health
services.
the
language
is
straightforward,
it's
unambiguous,
and
there's
no
prospectivity
requirement.
respondents'
only
meaningful
answer
to
the
statutory
language
are
statements
in
the
legislative
history
that
say
that
cost
limit
rules
would
operate
prospectively.
in
our
view,
those
statements
reflect
congress'
understanding
that
cost
limit
rules
generally
in
practice
would
operate
prospectively,
which
is
in
fact
what
they
do
in
practice.
but
we
think
those
statements
fall
far
short
of
suggesting
that
congress
decided
and
considered
the
possibility
of
retroactive
rules
being
appropriate
in
certain
confined
circumstances.
indeed,
the
very
reasons
that
congress
gives
for
generally
favoring
prospective
rules
we
believe
are
the
reasons
it
is
most
unlikely
that
congress
intended
to
bar
all
retroactive
rules.
congress
was
concerned
about
providers
incurring
costs
before
they
knew
the
substance
of
the
cost
limit
rule.
in
this
case
respondents
incurred
all
of
their
costs
before
the
1981
rule
was
invalidated.
in
fact,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
for
this
reason
if
the
secretary
had
not
promulgated
a
retroactive
rule,
the
very
concerns
expressed
by
congress
would
have
been
realized,
because
other
providers
relied
to
their
advantage
on
the
substance
of
the
1981
rule
in
incurring
their
costs.
this
is
not
a
rule
that
the
secretary
promulgated
to,
despite
its
unfairness.
the
retroactive
rule
was
promulgated
in
order
to
avoid
unfairness.
more
hospitals
benefit
from
the
retroactive
rule
than
are
burdened.
in
over
234
areas
the
wage
indices
went
up.
in
67
areas
the
wage
indices
went
down.
the
federal
government
may
end
up
paying
more
money
out
under
the
retroactive
rule
than
they
would
have
under
a
prospective
rule.
the
government
is
not...
in
other
words,
this
is
not
a
case
where
we're
just
trying
to
promulgate
a
retroactive
rule
to
save
the
federal
face.
it's
a
case
where
the
retroactive
rule
is
justified
for
two
other
compelling
reasons.
one,
to
ensure
adequate
reimbursement
for
other
providers
who
were
receiving
too
little
reimbursement
under
the
medicare
act,
and
second,
to
prevent
a
windfall
by
a
few
providers
who
were
seeking
to
recover
reimbursement
for
inefficient
costs
at
the
expense
of
other
providers.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
no.
i
said
it's
theoretically
possible.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
we
don't,
we
don't,
we
don't
have--
--kind
of
an
unusual,
somewhat
inconsistent
with
the
normal
practice.
but
it
is
in
that
it
was
234
areas
that
wage
indices
went
up.
and
if
you
look
at
the
administrative
record,
i
think
six
hospitals
out
of
eight
total
commented
in
favor
of
excluding
the
federal
wage
data
in
this,
in
this
rule.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
it's
within
the
secretary's
discretion.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
that's
right.
the
question
is
whether,
how
much
further
the
secretary
can
go,
whether
the
secretary
can
approach
these
things
in
what
we
believe
is
an
efficient
manner,
and
that
is
in
a
systemic
basis
correcting
the
rule
itself,
rather
than
being
forced
to
go
through
numerous
and
we
believe
duplicative
and
wasteful
case
by
case
review.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--our
dispute
with
the
court
of
appeals
on
that,
on
that
question
is
the
following.
the
court
of
appeals
has
stated
that
the
invalidation
of
the
1981
rule
necessarily
had
the
effect
of
reinstating
the
1979
rule,
so
as
to
preclude
the
secretary
from
on
remand
promulgating
a
new
rule.
we
believe
that
as
a
general
rule
a
court's
authority
to
issue
a
remedy
is
confined
to
the
nature
of
the
agency's
error.
now
that
may
have
the
result,
justice
scalia,
that
may
have
the
result
of
leaving
the
only
valid
agency
action
remaining
to
be
a
prior
agency
rule.
but
that
does
not
preclude
the
agency
on
remand
from
determining
in
the
first
instance
what
law
should
apply,
perhaps
by
subsequently
promulgating
a
retroactive
rule,
perhaps
by
immediately
promulgating
on
an
interim
basis
a
rule.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
but
the
question
is
whether
it
has
the
effect
of
them
precluding
the
agency
ultimately
on
remand
from
deciding
what
rule
of
law
should
apply.
and
this
court's
decision,
burlington
northern,
made
quite
clear
that
the
court
could
not
ultimately
decide
what
law
should
apply
as
of
the
future.
but
the
court's
decision
may
have
the
effect
of
leaving
the
only
valid
agency
action
remaining
to
be
some
prior
agency
decision.
but
it
doesn't
preclude
the
agency
ultimately
from
deciding
what
the
law
should
be.
and
it's
that
aspect--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--well,
that's
where,
of
course,
we
disagree.
we
think
the
agency
can
decide--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--again,
it
would
depend
on
the
nature...
in
some
instances,
for
instance,
the
court's
decision
would
only
suggest
that
the
substance
of
the
new
rule
was
valid,
and
it
might
not,
it
might
only
question
the
agency's
determination
that
a
substance
of
a
new
rule
was
valid
itself.
it
might
not
question
the
agency's
determination
that
the
old
rule
was
invalid,
in
which
case
it
wouldn't
necessarily
leave
the
prior
agency
action
intact,
and
for
that
reason
i
think
undermines
why
it's
important
that
the
agency
should
be
able
to
decide
on
remand,
because
in
the
absence
of
that
there
would
essentially
be
absence
of
power
of
retroactivity,
there
would
be
virtually
no,
no
law
to
apply.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
it's
my
understanding
that
it
is
not
formally
part
of
the
record.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
have
just
a
few
points
in
rebuttal.
first,
the
district
court
did
not
order
the
secretary
to
reimburse
him
pursuant
to
the
1979
rule.
the
court
found
only
one
error
in
the
1981
rule,
the
lack
of
notice
and
comment,
and
specifically
declined
to
order
the
secretary
to
reimburse
him
pursuant
to
the
1979
rule.
if
you
look
at
oberdorfer's
opinion,
at
page
62(a)
in
the
appendix--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--it
was
an,
it
was
an
error
which
required...
the
secretary
promulgated
a
new
rule.
but
it
was
not
one,
which
judge
oberdorfer
correctly
recognized,
which
mandated
that
he
order
reimbursement
pursuant
to
the
1979
rule.
and
in
his
opinion
he
explained
why.
he
said,
it
is
clear
that
to
invalidate
the
1981
wage
index
rule
and
enjoin
defendants,
the
secretary,
from
retroactively
applying
any
new
schedule
that
excludes
federal
wage
data
might
well
permit
claims
to
recover
a
larger
amount
of
medicare
reimbursement
than
they
would
under
the
present
1981
schedule.
he
recognized
that
for
that
reason
it
would
be
appropriate,
and
he
didn't
do
so.
second,
the
respondents
concede,
i
believe,
that
the
apa
does
not
bar
retroactive
rules
in
all
circumstances,
that
in
narrow
circumstances
it
is
appropriate.
it
depends
on
whether
they're
necessary
to
serve
congressional
intent.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
but
there--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--the
same
concerns,
though,
whether
or
not
the
retroactive
rule
is
essentially
necessary
under
congressional
intent
is
precisely
the
test
that
we
suggest
would
be
appropriate
under
arbitrary
and
capricious
review.
and
we
believe
here
that
the
statutory
interests
being
served
are
the
need
to
ensure
the
providers
are
not
reimbursed
for
costs
they
inefficiently
incurred.
they
can't
have
it
both
ways.
either
it
prohibits
it
or
it
doesn't.
and
we
believe
it
doesn't,
that
the
test
about
whether
congress,
that
needs
require
should
be
addressed
during
arbitrary
and
capricious.
thank
you.
