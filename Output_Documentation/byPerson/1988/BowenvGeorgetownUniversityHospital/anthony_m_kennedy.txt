justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
he
use
the
retroactivity
section
to
promulgate
regulations
on
depreciation
recapture
at
one
time
early
in
the
act?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
he
cite
the
statutory
authority
for
those
recapture
regulation...
or
the
recapture
rules?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
prevail
in
this
case,
what
about
those
hospitals
that
have
been
benefited
under
the
invalid
rule?
is
the
secretary
entitled
to
recoup
from
them
now?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let's
assume
there
were
no
statute
of
limitations
or
re-opening
period.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
the,
if
the
court
invalidates
the
rule,
and
forgetting
the
statute
of
limitations
for
a
moment,
isn't
the
secretary
entitled
to
go
back
and
recoup
the
amounts
that
were
paid
in
excess
under
the
invalid
rule?
