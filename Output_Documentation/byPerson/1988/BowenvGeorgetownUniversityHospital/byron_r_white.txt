justice
byron
r.

well
what
if,
what
if
the
secretary
had
promulgated
a
rule
applicable
to
this
past
period
which,
which
was
aimed
at
refunding
to
people
who
had
paid
on
what
the
secretary
now
thought
was
an
improper
basis?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
that
be--
justice
byron
r.
white
--now,
what
you're
really
saying
is
that
this
rule
that
he
promulgated
isn't
a
rule
at
all
under
the
definition.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so,
and
so
the
rule
that
i
just
described
would
not
be
a
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be
so.
but--
justice
byron
r.
white
--he
couldn't
do
it
by
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why,
why
should
the
rule
be
different
if
the
secretary,
he
doesn't
fail
to
issue
a
regulation
but
he
issues
one
that
is
invalid
procedurally?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
he
doesn't
fail
to
issue
a
regulation
but
he
issues
a
regulation
that
is
invalid
because
of
procedural
omissions?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
in,
in,
in
short
there
is
no
regulation
in
place.
why
can't
he
then
issue
a
retroactive
regulation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there's
certainly
authority
for
him
to
have
the
regulation
in
effect.
justice
byron
r.
white
you,
you
must
be
sure
that
he
cannot
to
win
here,
i
suppose.
