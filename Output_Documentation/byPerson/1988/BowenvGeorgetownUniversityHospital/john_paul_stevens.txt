but
mr.
lazarus,
didn't
they
also
reimburse
them
under
the
1979
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
did
he
reopen
the...
did
he
recoup
the
money
that
he
paid
pursuant
to
the
1979
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
thought
it
was
for
later
years.
i
see.
but
all,
in
other
words
the
result
is
just
the
same
as
if
the
original
rule
had
been
upheld?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
particular
reimbursement
was
then
recouped?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
wonder
why
they
even
reimbursed
him.
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
a
matter
of
administrative
grace,
just
lend
them
the
money,
in
effect.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
has
any
court
ever
suggested
that
"future
effect"
means
what
you
say
it
means?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
aren't
the
words
completely
redundant
under
your
view?
won't
every...
every
rule
will
have
future
effect,
couldn't
avoid
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lazarus,
does
the
record
tell
us
what
you're
telling
us
about
the
fact
the
rule
actually
caused
the
government
to
give
more
money
away?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
it's
theoretically
possible.
