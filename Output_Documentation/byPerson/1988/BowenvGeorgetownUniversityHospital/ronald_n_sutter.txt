mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
issue
is
the
validity
of
the
secretary's
1984
retroactive
wage
index
rule.
that
rule
is
identical
with
the
secretary's
1981
wage
index
rule.
we
successfully
challenged
the
1981
rule
in
the
dcha
case.
the
secretary
did
not
appeal.
the
secretary
paid
us
in
accordance
with
our
claims,
he
paid
us
under
the
pre-existing
rule.
but
that
did
not
end
the
matter.
the
secretary
proceeded
to
promulgate
his
retroactive
rule.
he
applied
that
rule
to
take
back
the
monies
that
he
had
previously
paid
as
a
result
of
dcha.
he
stated
in
his
re-opening
notices
that
his
retroactive
rule
had
reversed
dcha.
the
secretary's
1984
rule
is
totally
devoid
of
future
effect.
it
was
promulgated
on
november
26th,
1984,
and
applied
in
1985,
but
applied
only
to
the
past.
it
applies
exclusively
to
the
period
july
1,
1981
through
september
30,
1982,
a
period
that
had
long
since
been
completed
even
when
the
secretary
issued
his
retroactive
1984
rule.
we
contend
that
the
secretary's
rule
is
invalid
on
4
discreet
grounds.
first,
the
medicare
statute
bars
the
secretary
from
issuing
a
retroactive
cost
limit
rule.
second,
the
apa
bars
the
secretary
from
issuing
a
rule
with
primary
retroactive
effect.
third,
this
rule
does
not
pass
muster
under
the
chenery
balancing
test.
and
finally,
setting
aside
retroactivity
altogether,
this
rule
is
arbitrary
and
capricious,
even
under
the
standards
normally
applied
to
the
prospective
rules.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
well,
i
don't
know--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--justice
white--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--it
is
not
a
rule.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
i
think
that's
correct,
justice
white,
but
i
think,
as
justice
judge
oberdorfer
stated
in
his
case
below,
it
is
well
established
administrative
law
that
an
agency
may
always
waive
application
of
a
rule
when
in
individual
circumstances
he
thinks
justice
so
requires.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
it
would
simply
be
a
matter--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--well,
it
would
be
a
matter
of
waiving
his
past
rule.
that's
right.
it
wouldn't
be
a
rule.
that's
correct.
i,
when
i
stated
our
four
grounds
i
used
the
word
apa.
in
our
view
it
is
absolutely
clear
that
the
medicare
statute
precludes
the
secretary
from
issuing
a
retroactive
cost
limit
rule.
the
governing
statutory
provision,
section
223(b)
of
the
1972
amendment,
uses
words
that
import
prospectivity,
and
i
think
that
is
specifically
confirmed
by
the
legislative
history.
both
the
house
and
senate
reports
expressly
state
that
the
limits
must
be
exercised
on
a
prospective
rather
than
retrospective
basis.
the
secretary's
regulations
state
that
the
limits
will
be
imposed
prospectively,
and
the
prospectivity
requirement
is
also
confirmed
by
all
of
the
secretary's
prior
schedules
and
by
his
own
administrative
decision-making.
what
the
secretary
has
done
here
marks
a
radical
departure
from
12
years
of
consistent
agency
construction.
we
reminded
the
secretary
of
this
fact
in
our
public
comments,
but
the
secretary
did
not
respond.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
reconcile
what
the
secretary
has
done
here
with
the
statutory
language
or
the
legislative
history
or
the
secretary's
own
regulations
or
the
statements
in
the
prior
schedules
or
the
secretary's
own
prior
decision-making.
there
is
simply
no
explanation
to
reconcile.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
i,
i
think--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--that,
that
would
certainly
be
a
possibility,
justice
scalia.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
i
don't
think
it
would
incur
any
opposition.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
also,
in
response
to
the
government's
point
about
how,
if
the
secretary
didn't
act
he
would
have
to
recoup
from
other
hospitals,
i
think
that's
absolutely
incorrect.
dcha
was
not
a
class
action
suit.
it
involved
only
a
limited
number
of
hospitals.
it
did
not
require
any
action,
either
favorable
or
unfavorable
against
hospitals
that
were
not
participating.
and
indeed
the
secretary
published
his
1984
rule
after
settling
virtually
all
cost
reports
in
the
country.
he
did
not
pay
those
other
hospitals
under
the
wage
index
which
included
federal
government
hospital
data.
he
continued
to
use
the
1981
wage
index
rule
for
those
other
hospitals.
and
in
other
circumstances
he
has
clearly
taken
the
position
that
he's
not
required
to
recoup
in
circumstances
similar
to
these,
we
have
cited
that
in
the
last
paragraph
of
our
footnote
36,
which
contains
those
references.
and
judge
oberdorfer
in
his
decision
in
this
case,
at
pages
38
and
39
of
the
petition
appendix,
explains,
provides
further
reasons
why
there,
why
recoupment
would
not
be
required
from
other
hospitals.
so
i
think
there's
simply
no
merit
at
all
to
that,
to
the
suggestion
from
the
secretary
on
that
point.
the
secretary
now
relies
on,
although
he
did
not
rely
on
during
the
rulemaking,
the
retroactive
corrective
adjustment
provision,
which
dates
from
the
original
1965
legislation.
he
argues
that
that
provision
confers
on
him
the
authority
to
issue
retroactive
rules,
including
retroactive
cost
limit
rules.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
this
is,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
will
find
this
in
our
appendix
at
page
4,
before
you
get
to
number
5,
the
public
law,
it's
maybe,
oh,
about
eight
or
nine
pages
down
from
the
top
there's
a
little
two
i
s,
the
language
that
begins,
"provide
with
the
making
of
suitable
retroactive
corrective
adjustments.
"
that
is
the
language
that
the
secretary
is
now
relying
on.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
that
is
part
of
1861(v)(1)(a).
that's
correct.
we
believe
that
the
secretary's
reliance
on
that
provision
is
clearly
misplaced
for
several
reasons.
first,
it
subverts
congressional
intent.
when
congress
enacted
section
223(b)
of
the
1972
amendments,
it
made
as
clear
as
it
possibly
could
that
cost
limits
are
to
apply
only
on
a
prospective
basis.
that
clear
expression
of
congressional
intent
must
prevail,
however
the
retroactive
provision
is
construed
in
other
circumstances.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
that
is
the
statutory
language.
that's
correct.
and
i
rely
on
the
specific
words
in
both
the
house
and
senate
report,
which
state
that
the
limits
must
be
exercised
on
a
prospective
rather
than
retrospective
basis.
section
223(b)
would
trump
the
retroactive
provision
here.
but,
the
second
point
that
may
be
even
more
significant
is,
the
interpretation
which
the
secretary
is
advancing
here
is
post
hoc
interpretation
conflicts
with
his
own
regulations.
his
regulations
have
never
construed
the
retroactive
provision
as
conferring
on
him
the
authority
to
issue
retroactive
rules.
his
regulations
have
always
construed
that
provision
as
a
year-end
accounting
reconciliation
process.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
he
did
not.
justice
kennedy,
he
did
not.
i
have
recently
reviewed
both
the
proposed
rule
and
the
final
rule
in
the
preamble.
he
did
not
rely
on
the
provision
in
promulgating
those
rules.
and
that
was
a
rule
involving
secondary
retroactivity,
not
primary
retroactivity.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
well
at
the
end,
i
mean,
he
always
has
a
little
section
which,
which
cites
the
authority.
i'm
sure
he
included,
i
didn't
specifically
look
at
this.
i'm
sure
he
included
section
1861(v).
but
there's
nothing
in
the
preamble
which
would
suggest
that
he
thought
he
was
acting
pursuant
to
some
kind
of
special
delegation
of
retroactive
rulemaking
authority,
as
there
was
not
in
the
preamble
here.
and
i
might
also
note
that
the
secretary
could
not
in
good
faith
have
done
that
in
the
1984
preamble,
because
at
the
same
time
that
he
was
publishing
this
rule
he
was
arguing
in
court
that
the
retroactive
provision
means
exactly
what
his
regulations
say
it
means.
and
for
evidence
of
that
you
can
look
at
the
9th
circuit's
decision
in
regents
of
the
university
of
california,
which
is
reported
as
771
f.
2d.
and
if
you
read
that
opinion,
1985
decision,
a
year
after
this
rule
was
promulgated,
he
stated
there
that
this
provision,
the
retroactive
provision,
means
exactly
what
he
says
in
his
regulation,
it's
a
year-end
balancing
process.
what
the
secretary
has
done
here,
this
post-hoc
construction,
which
he
cannot
cite
any
authority
for
in
his
brief,
marks
a
radical
departure
from
22
years
of
consistent
agency
construction.
that's
been
the
secretary's
interpretation
in
his
regulation
since
1966,
and
it's
still
there
today.
third,
i
think
the
secretary's
interpretation,
his
post
hoc
construction,
is
not
a
possible
reading
of
that
language
anyway.
the
language
refers
to
a
process
of
retroactive
adjustments
where
a
provider's
aggregate
reimbursement
for
a
period
proves
to
be
excessive.
it
focuses
on
actual
evidence
regarding
the
aggregate
reimbursement
of
a
provider.
and
i
can't
imagine
any
language
more
foreign
than
this
to
the
notion
of
issuing
retroactive
rules
of
general
application.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
that
is
correct,
yes.
that's
correct.
i'd
now
like
to
consider
the
apa.
there
are
two
relevant
statutory
provisions,
5
usc
section
551(4)
and
5
usc
section
553(d).
section
551(4)
defines
a
rule
as
something
having,
among
other
things,
future
effect,
and
states
it
includes
the
prescription
for
the
future
of
certain
matters,
matters
that
would
be
encompassed
within
this
case.
i
think
justice
scalia
was
entirely
correct
in
pointing
out
that
there's
a
big
difference
between
in
the
future
and
for
the
future.
it
is
certainly
correct
that
if
an
agency
publishes
a
rule
in
1984,
applies
it
in
1985,
to
recoup
from
1981,
the
secretary
is
acting
in
the
future,
at
least
from
a
1984
vantage
point.
but
he
is
not
acting
for
the
future.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
i
don't
think
it's
the
be-all
and
the
end-all.
but
i
think
the
significance
is
illustrated
when
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
and
you
also
look
at
5
usc
section
553(d),
which
generally
prescribes
a
30-day
delayed
effective
date.
i
think
it's
important
to
look
at
those
two
together.
and
i
think
the
legislative
history
does
confirm
a
plain
meaning
construction.
the
legislative
history
states,
and
this
is
in
the
legislative
history
volume
at
page
254,
that
rules
formally
prescribe
a
course
of
conduct
for
the
future
rather
than
pronounce
past
or
existing
rights
or
liabilities.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
no,
justice
o'connor,
we
do
not.
we--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--let
me
give
you
an
example.
justice
frankfurter
stated
in
the
addison
case
that
law
should
avoid
retroactivity
as
much
as
possible.
and
i
think
the
thing
to
focus
on
is
whether
it
is
possible
to
avoid
retroactivity.
i
think
there
may
be
some
instances
in
which
it
will
not
be
possible
to
avoid
even
primary
retroactivity.
suppose,
for
instance,
that
a
statute
requires
that
a
certain
benefit
be
in
effect
as
of
a
certain
date
in
accordance
with
regulations
issued
by
the
secretary,
the
clear
congressional
intent
that
the
secretary
have
regulations
in
place
as
of
a
certain
date,
and
the
secretary
simply
doesn't
do
so.
in
that
case
i
concede
that
it
would
be
possible
to
allow
him
to
issue
them
retroactively.
i
see
that
as
simply
a
case
of
the
more
specific
prevailing
over
the
general,
the
specific
intent
of
congress
that
these
regulations
be
in
place
as
of
a
certain
date
prevailing
over
the
general
rule
in
the
apa.
i
see
it
as
a
general
rule
in
the
apa.
i
believe
that's
also
how
the
d.c.
circuit
saw
it.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
yes,
it
is.
because
i
see
congress'
more
specific
intent
controlling
in
that
case.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
i'm
sorry.
that
is...
i
didn't
hear
what
you
said.
procedurally--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--right.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
i
think
that
if,
if
there
was
a
clear
congressional
mandate
that
the
regulation
be
in
effect
as
of
a
certain
date,
he
could.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
if
there's
just
authority
i'm
not
sure
that
he
can.
let
me
take,
let
me
take
our
situation
here.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
well,
there
are
two
reasons
that
he
cannot
here.
one
is,
he
had
a
pre-existing
rule.
if
this
rule
is
of
no
effect,
it
leaves
in
place
what
was
there
before.
that's
one
reason.
the
cost
limits
would
not,
i
think,
in
any
event
allow
the
secretary
to
act
retroactively,
not
only
because
congress
said
they
had
to
be
prospective,
but
also
because
congress
has
never
mandated
that
there
be
cost
limits.
the
congress
authorized
the
secretary
to
issue
cost
limits.
it
did
not
require
him
to
do
so.
and
in
the
16
years
since
section
223(b)
was
enacted,
for
seven
of
those
16
years
there
have
been
no
cost
limits,
and
there
haven't
been
any
since
1983.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
that
is
correct.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
justice
scalia,
that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
yes...
well,
i
don't
know
if
often,
but
it
does
happen.
and
in
dcha,
the
secretary
did
expressly
ask
that
judge
oberdorfer
stay
his
decision
so
that
the
secretary
could
take
further
action,
and
judge
oberdorfer
declined
to
do
that.
but
he
did
cite
several
of
the
sort
of
cases
that
you're
referring
to,
and
he
distinguished
those
and
said,
no,
that
that
remedy
would
clearly
be
inapplicable
here.
one
of
the
points
i
think
is
important
is
that
if
the
secretary
disagreed
with
judge
oberdorfer
at
that
point
in
dcha,
he
should
have
appealed.
that
was
his
appropriate
remedy,
because
judge
oberdorfer,
i
think,
clearly
indicated
that
these
corrective
procedures
would
not
be
appropriate
here.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
no.
he
couldn't
even
recoup
from
them
now,
because
the
three-year
re-opening
period
is
over.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
i,
i
don't
think
so
because
dcha
was
not
a
class
action,
involved
only
a
few
hospitals,
and
did
not
require
him
to
do
anything
with
respect
to
other
hospitals,
certainly
did
not
require
him
to
do
anything
with
hospitals--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--the
secretary
has
taken
the
position
in
other
contexts
that
that
would
be
unfair
for
him
to
do
that,
and
he
wouldn't
do
that.
and
we,
we
have
citations
in
the
last
paragraph
of
our
footnote
36
where
he's
taken
that
position
elsewhere.
and
again
i
think
judge
oberdorfer
in
his
decision
below
at
pages
38
through
39
offers
several
reasons
why
the
secretary
would
not
be
required
to
do
so.
the
cost
limits,
under
the
cost
limits
he's
always
had
authorities
to
grant
exceptions,
and
there's
a
big
exceptions
process,
and
his
authority
to
grant
exceptions
will
be
found
in
the
legislative
history.
also
there's
the
general
principle
of
administrative
law
that
an
agency
may
waive
application
of
a
rule
where--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--well,
perhaps.
i
think
you
would
have
a
balancing
test
involved
there,
and
there
would
be
questions
of
fairness.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
well,
the
sort
of
balancing
test
that
you
would
have
under
chenery.
what
are
the
ill
effects
of
the
retroactivity?
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
well,
it
might--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--well,
the
1981
rule
might
have
affected
their
conduct.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
it
was
issued
on
june
30,
1981
to
be
effective
the
following
day.
so
it's
conceivable
that
it
might
have
had
some
effect.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
the
1984
rule
affects
only
past
conduct.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
the
1984
rule
was
promulgated
on
november
26th,
1984,
to
go
back
to
1981--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--yes.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
oh,
it
would
have
no
effect
on,
on
other
hospitals.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
that's
correct.
the
1984
rule
could
not
have
affected--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--it
is
tough.
i
would
like
to
briefly
discuss
5
usc
section
553(d),
that
establishes
a
30-day
delayed
effective
date.
this
rule
here
applies
back
to
july
1,
1981,
thus
despite
what
the
secretary
may
say
it
has
an
effective
date
of
july
1,
1981.
and
yet
553(d)
precludes
a
retroactive
effective
date.
section
553(d)
is
very
similar
to
a
statute
which
this
court
addressed
in
the
case
of
united
states
v.
baltimore
&
ohio
railroad
company,
which
we've
cited
in
our
brief.
that
case
involved
a
statute
that
precluded
certain
orders...
let
me
rephrase
that.
it
established
a
30-day
delayed
effective
date
for
certain
orders
of
the
icc.
and
all
members
of
this
court,
including
the
dissent
in
that
case,
agreed
on
one
thing,
that
is
that
the
statute
precluded
the
<icc>
[=
icc]
from
applying
these
rules
retroactively.
the
language
of
that
statute
in
553(d)
are
very
close,
and
i
think
merit
very
close
review.
i
would
like
to
briefly
address
the
secretary's
curative
rulemaking
argument.
we
believe
that
the,
the
secretary's
attempted
curing
is
something
that
cannot
be
done
because
of
the
very
nature
of
the
problem
here.
the
secretary
has
missed
a
very
important
deadline
established
by
congress,
one
that
reflects
important
values.
from
a
procedural
point
of
view
he
was
certainly
entitled
to
repeal
his,
or
his
1979
rule
and
put
in
effect
a
new
rule.
but
to
do
that
validly
he
had
to
publish
a
final
rule
by
june
1,
1981
under
section
553(d),
and
he
had
to
have
completed
the
procedures
mandated
by
the
apa
by
that
date.
he
had
to
publish
a
proposed
notice,
solicit
comments,
respond
to
the
comments
and
publish
a
basis
and
purpose
statement.
he
didn't
do
that.
in
fact
he
didn't
even
start
those
procedures
by
june
1,
1981.
and
there's
nothing
that
the
secretary
can
do
in
1984
to
complete
those
procedures
by
june
1,
1981.
that's
simply
axiomatic.
also,
the
secretary
at
bottom
is
asking
this
court
to
reward
him
for
his
illegal
conduct.
if
the
secretary
had
acted
legally
on
june
30,
1981,
when
he
published
the
1981
rule,
he
could
not
have
given
his
new
rule
an
effective
date
of
july
1,
1981.
there's
no
reason
why
the
secretary
should
be
in
a
better
position
today
because
he
acted
illegally
rather
than
legally
on
that
date.
to
allow
that
would
truly
be
to
trivialize
and
make
a
mockery
of
the
apa.
as
far
as
our
third
and
fourth
contentions
go,
we
believe
that
we
would
be
entitled
to
a
judgment,
to
favorable
judgment
under
any
balancing
test,
as
judge
oberdorfer
expressly
found.
judge
oberdorfer
applied
the
balancing
test,
and
the
ill
effects
of
the
secretary's
rule
have
been
very
substantial.
he
has
applied
this
rule
to
reverse
a
final
court
judgment.
he
has
in
effect
substituted
retroactive
rulemaking
for
the
normal
appeals
process.
he
has
applied
this
rule
to
recoup
from
already
settled
cost
reports.
in
this
case
he
applied
it
to
recoup
medicare
reimbursement
for
a,
a,
for
costs
incurred
four
years
previously,
but
presumably
under
the
secretary's
view
it
could
have
been
six,
seven,
eight
years
previously.
it
would
be
very
hard
to
draw
the
limit.
and
as
for
the
merits,
well
we
have
made
our
case
in
our
brief
at
some
length,
and
i
think
we
have
demonstrated
that
in
issuing
this
rule
the
secretary
failed
to
consider
relevant
factors
and
drew
conclusions
contrary
to
the
evidence.
and
in
his
brief,
the
secretary
loosely
throws
around
the
windfalls,
the
word
"windfalls",
but
you
will
note
that
he
has
made
no
response
to
our
showing.
he
says,
that
should
be
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals.
but
you
might
want
to
look
at
his
last
briefs
before
the
court
of
appeals
because
he
essentially
made
no
showing
on
the
merits
there.
if
the
secretary
had
a
case
to
make
on
the
merits,
he
would
make
it.
he
has
not
made
it.
i
can
tell
you
as
someone
who
has
read
every
page
of
the
record
at
least
four
or
five
times,
the
secretary
cannot
make
a
case
on
the
merits.
the
rulemaking
in
this
case
was
truly
pro
forma,
as
judge
oberdorfer
found
in
his
decision.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
and
should
be
affirmed
for
any
or
all
of
the
four
reasons
that
we
have
discussed
today.
thank
you.
