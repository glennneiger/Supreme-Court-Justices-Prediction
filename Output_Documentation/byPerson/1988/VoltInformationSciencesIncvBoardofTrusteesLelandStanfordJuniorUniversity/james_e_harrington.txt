mr.
james
e.
harrington
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
the
effect
of
a
contractual
choice-of-law
clause
on
federal
preemption
of
a
state
statute
that
conflicts
with
the
federal
arbitration
act.
the
case
presents
several
discrete
issues
that
have
been
raised
in
brief
by
the
parties.
these
issues
include:
first,
the
question
of
whether
the
state
court
of
appeal
was
correct
in
construing
the
choice-of-law
clause
to
exclude
any
application
of
federal
law
to
this
case
and
thus
to
shield
the
state
statute
against
preemption;--
second,
whether
the
choice-of-law
clause
should
be
held
invalid
and
unenforceable
as
a
violation
of
the
federal
public
policy
favoring
the
arbitration
of
private
disputes
in
the
event
that
the
court
of
appeal's
interpretation
of
the
clause
should
be
accepted;--
and
third,
the
question
raised
by
stanford's
contention
that
the
state
statute
at
issue
here
would
not
be
preempted
by
the
federal
arbitration
act
even
in
the
event
that
the
contract
had
contained
no
choice-of-law
clause.
in
addition
to
these
three
substantive
issues,
the
case
presents
a...
a
fourth
issue
that
was
raised
by
the
court
itself
in
its
order
postponing
consideration
of
the
question
of
its
jurisdiction,
and
that
issue,
at
least
as
the
parties
have
discerned
it
from
the
court's
order,
is
whether
the
court
has
jurisdiction
to
reexamine
the
court
of
appeal's
interpretation
of
the
choice-of-law
clause
or
whether,
on
the
other
hand,
that
interpretation
rests
upon
an
adequate
and
independent
state
ground
that
precludes
review
of
that
issue
by
this
court.
under
the
rules
of
the
court,
i
am
of
course
required
to
discuss
the
jurisdictional
issue
at
the
outset
of
my
argument,
and
i
will
therefore
proceed
directly
to
an
examination
of
that
issue,
leaving
the
remaining
issues
i've
mentioned
for
treatment
later
in
the
course
of
the
argument
if
time
should
still
permit.
turning
then
to
the
question
of
jurisdiction,
i
would
remind
the
court
initially
that
we
have
enumerated
in
our
briefs
no
less
than
eight
alternative
reasons
why
this
court,
indeed,
possesses
jurisdiction
to
determine
the
effect
of
the
choice-of-law
clause
in
this
case
and
why
this
court's
examination
of
that
issue
is
not
foreclosed
by
an
adequate
and
independent
state
ground.
i,
of
course,
won't
recapitulate
all
of
these
reasons
here.
rather
i
want
to
emphasize
only
two
of
them
that
i
seem
to
be
particularly
important:
the
first
of
them,
because
it
would
permit
the
court
to
sustain
its
jurisdiction
in
this
case
on
a
particularly
narrow
ground,
if
it
should
so
desire;
and
the
other,
because
it
would
allow
the
court
to
provide
significant
further
guidance
for
the
development
of
the
law
concerning
the
general
question
of
the
effect
of
a...
of
a
choice-of-law
clause
on
the
scope
of
federal
preemption
and
the
applicability
of
federal
law.
the
first
and
probably
the
narrowest
ground
on
which
the
court
might
sustain
its
jurisdiction
in
this
case
is
provided
by
the
specific
wording
of
the
choice-of-law
clause
itself.
as
the
court
will
recall,
the
clause
provides
that
the
contract
shall
be
governed
by
"the
law
of
the
place
where
the
project
is
located.
"
since
there
was
no
extrinsic
evidence
in
the
record
of
what
the
parties
meant
by
that
phrase,
the
only
way
the
phrase
can
be
interpreted
and
the
only
way
the
court
of
appeal
could,
could
have
interpreted
it
is
by
deciding...
is
by
determining
the
literal
meaning
of
those
words,
"law
of
the
place
where
the
project
is
located.
"
but
in
order
to
determine
the
literal
meaning
of
those
words,
one
has
to
decide
what
law
is
in
fact
a
law
of
the
place
where
the
project
is
located
or,
in
other
words,
what
law
applies
at
that
place.
and
in
this
case,
since
the
question
was
whether
federal
law
in
particular
was
encompassed
within
the
scope
of
the
phrase,
one
can
only
interpret
the
phrase
in
reference
to
that
issue
by
deciding
whether
federal
law
in
particular
applies
at
that
place.
mr.
james
e.
harrington
well,
it
might
have
been
a
question
of
fact,
mr.
chief
justice,
if...
if
there
had
been
any
evidence
in
the
record
concerning
the
parties'
intent,
but
i
know
it's
well-settled
in
california
and
presumably
in
the
federal
courts
as
well
that
where
there
is
no
extrinsic
evidence
bearing
upon
the
meaning
of
the
words
in
a
contract,
then
the
meaning
of
the
contract
is
a
question
of
law
that
the
appellate
court
has
jurisdiction
to
review
de
novo.
mr.
james
e.
harrington
but
we
have,
of
course,
presented
in
our...
excuse
me,
justice
white.
mr.
james
e.
harrington
well,
that's
apparently
what
the
court
of
appeal
said,
and
of
course
we,
we
think
that
the...
since
california--
mr.
james
e.
harrington
--well,
if
place
means
a
place
within
the
state
of
california,
which
in
this
case
it
was...
must
necessarily
have
meant,
then
it
also
means
a
place
within
the
united
states.
and
so,
federal
law--
mr.
james
e.
harrington
--well,
the
question
in
this
case,
of
course,
is
whether...
in
the
first
place
we...
we...
as
we've
shown
i
think
in
our
reply
brief,
there
are
two
flatly
contrary
rulings.
the
most
recent
rulings
of
the
other
courts
of
appeals
are
contrary
on
this
question
of
how
to
interpret
this
type...
this
type
of
choice-of-clause...
choice-of-law
clause,
and
in
those
cases,
the
clause
went
a
little
further
than
this
and
said
the
law...
the
law
of
california
or
i
think
in
one
case
it
was
the
law
of
new
york--
mr.
james
e.
harrington
--let's
see.
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
chief
justice's
question.
mr.
james
e.
harrington
well,
i
think
this...
this
court
has
indicated
that...
in
that
case
there
would
be
no...
no
question
of
federal
law
involved
in
the
syllogism
by
which
the
court
reaches
its
interpretation
of
the
clause
because
the
question
of
which
is
the
larger
as
between
those
two
cities
is--
mr.
james
e.
harrington
--not
a
federal
question.
mr.
james
e.
harrington
no,
i
wouldn't
i
think
it
would
be
a
question
of
fact,
which
is
the
larger
of
those
two
cities.
but
in
this
case
the
question
is
to
decide
the
meaning
of
this
phrase
with
reference
to
the
question,
which
was
the
question
in
this
case,
whether
that
phrase
encompasses
federal
law,
you
have
to
decide
is
federal
law
law
of
that
place.
is
federal
law--
mr.
james
e.
harrington
--[inaudible]
law
that
place.
mr.
james
e.
harrington
right.
mr.
james
e.
harrington
well,
i
think
to
answer
that
question,
justice
scalia,
i
have
to
turn
back
to
the
beginning.
since
there
was
no
extrinsic
evidence
of
what
the
parties
meant,
i
think
the
only
way
to
interpret
that
phrase
is
to
determine
the
literal
meaning
of
the
words.
and
to
me
the
literal
meaning
of
the
words,
"law
of
the
place
where
the
project
is
located.
"
must
be
determined
by
deciding
what
laws
apply
at
that
place.
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
about
what
the
place
is
here.
it's
the
stanford
campus
in
california.
and
the
question
is
what
laws
apply
at
that
place.
mr.
james
e.
harrington
no,
the--
mr.
james
e.
harrington
--right,
right.
well,
let
me...
let
me...
perhaps
i
can
illustrate
with
a
previous
decision
of
the
court
what
i...
what
i'm
getting
at
here.
my,
my
point
is
that
in
order
to,
to
interpret
this...
to
decide
whether
it
means
all
laws
applicable
at
the
place,
or
in
this
case
the
only
question
was
does
it
mean
federal
law
since
that
was
the...
that
was
the
matter
at
issue,
you,
you
have
to
decide
does...
does
federal
law
apply
at
the...
does...
well,
i,
i,
i
guess
the
nearest
analogy
i
can
think
of
is
a,
is
a
case
decided
in
1985
called
ake
v.
oklahoma
that
the
court
will
probably
recall.
and
the
issue...
the
issue
in
that
case
was
whether
a...
whether
the
defendant
had
waived
a
federal
constitutional
claim
by
failing
to
raise
it
at
trial.
and
the
court...
and
whether
that
was
an
adequate
and
independent
state
ground
to
sustain
the
court's
judgment
and
deprive
this
court
jurisdiction
to
review.
and
the
court
undertook
to
examine
the
oklahoma
decisions,
went
back
and
examined
the
oklahoma
decisions
and
said,
well,
it's
true
that
that
would
ordinarily
be
an
adequate
and...
adequate
and
independent
state
ground,
but
since
it
appears
that
it
is
the
oklahoma
law
that
so-called
fundamental
errors
cannot
be
waived
by
not
being
raised
at
trial
and
since
it
appears
also
under
oklahoma
law
that
so-called...
that
constitutional
errors
are
not...
are
fundamental
errors
that
cannot
be
waived,
therefore
it
appears
that
the
state
court's
decision
whether
this...
this
claim
should
have
been
deemed
waived
by
failing
to
raise
it
at
trial
was
logically
dependent
on
an
initial
determination
of
whether
this
was
a
constitutional
error.
and
since
that's
a
federal
question,
the
state
court's
ground
for...
or
rather,
the...
the
state
court's
decision
was
logically
dependent
on
determination
of
a
question
of
federal
law
and
therefore
could
not
be
an
adequate
and
independent
state
ground.
and
that's
the
point
i'm
making
here...
i...
is
simply
that
in
order
to
decide
that...
the
meaning
of
that
phrase
in
reference
to...
to
the
question
of
whether
federal
law
was
one
of
this
group
of
laws
that's
specified
within
this
clause,
one
has
to
decide
whether
federal
law
applies
at
that
place.
and
that's
a
federal
question.
mr.
james
e.
harrington
right.
mr.
james
e.
harrington
right
on
the
merits.
mr.
james
e.
harrington
oh,
that's
correct.
i'm
starting
with
the
jurisdictional
question.
mr.
james
e.
harrington
well,
to
turn
then...
so,
the
first...
the
first
and
i
think
the
narrowest
ground
is
to
follow
the,
the
approach
that
has
been
followed
in
ake
and
oklahoma
and
other
cases
such
as
united
airlines
against
main,
that
the...
the
state
court's
analysis
and
interpretation
of
the
phrase
was
bottomed
on
a
determination
of
whether
federal
law
applies
at
that
place.
and
that's
a
federal
question.
but
to
turn
then
to
a...
the
second
alternative--
mr.
james
e.
harrington
--whether
federal
law--
mr.
james
e.
harrington
--uh-hum.
mr.
james
e.
harrington
oh,
it
would
be
in
that
case.
mr.
james
e.
harrington
in
this
case
it
said
law
of
the
place
where
the
project
is
located,
and
the
question
has
to
be
answered--
mr.
james
e.
harrington
--in
order
to
interpret
the
clause,
what
is
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
project
is
located?
and
since
the
issue
in
this
case
was...
was
whether
federal
law
is
encompassed
within
the
meaning
of
that
phrase,
anyone
who
sets
out
to
interpret
that
phrase
has
to
say,
well,
is
federal
law
one
of
the
laws
of
that
place?
mr.
james
e.
harrington
and
in
order
to
answer
that,
you--
mr.
james
e.
harrington
--well,
you
mean
to
have...
to
designate
the
law
at
all.
mr.
james
e.
harrington
no.
the
point
of
having
it
in
there
is
to...
is
to
distinguish...
as
this
court
indicated
in
de
la
cuesta,
the
typical...
which
we've
discussed
in
our
briefs,
the
decision
in
de
la
cuesta.
the
normal
reason
for
these
types
of
choice-of-law
clauses
is
to
make
sure
that
california
law
applies
as
opposed
to
the
law
of
other
states
in
situations
in
which
there
isn't
any
federal
law,
which
is
most
situations
that
are
going
to
arise
on
a...
on
a
construction
project.
california
law,
of
course,
would
govern
99
percent
of
the
problems
that
would
arise
on
this
project,
but
in
the
case
of
arbitration,
we
have
federal
law
here.
and
so--
mr.
james
e.
harrington
--i
hope
so,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
james
e.
harrington
there's
about
a...
oh,
it
does.
it
does.
there's
about
a
half...
half
a
page
of
history
that's
uninformative,
justice
blackmun.
it...
i
would...
of
course,
it,
it,
it
reaches
a
contrary
result
on
how
to
handle
this
type
of
situation
from
what
this
court
reached
in
dean
witter
against
byrd
and
the
moses
cone
case
and
what
most
courts
have
reached.
but
we
could
get
into
the
wisdom
of--
mr.
james
e.
harrington
--i
would...
if
it
said
california...
well,
let
me
take
it
in
three
steps.
if
it
said
california
law,
i
would
agree
with
the
dissenting
justice
below
that
california
law
means
that
federal
law
is
an
inherent
part
of
california
law.
if
it
said
the
california
code
of
civil
procedure,
i
would
agree
that
it
should
be
interpreted
to
exclude
federal
law.
but
for
reasons
i'll
get
to
in
a
moment,
i
think
there
would
be
an
argument
there.
and
there's
a
stronger
argument
in
our
case.
there
would
be
an
argument
there
that
perhaps
that
should
be
held
unenforceable
because...
by...
because
the
parties
may
not
really
have
known
what
they
were
doing
in,
in
adopting
a
body
of
law
that
had
the
effect
of
nullifying
their
agreement
to
arbitrate
and
that
that
fact
might
have
offended
the
federal
policy
again
favoring
the
arbitration
of
private
disputes.
turning
then
to
a
second
and
considerably
broader
rationale
which
might
be
used
to
uphold
the
court's
jurisdiction,
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
the...
the
choice-of-law
issue
resolved
by
the
court
of
appeal,
besides
being
dependent
on
federal
law
in
the
way
i've
mentioned
and
in
the
various
other
ways
we've
described
in
our
briefs,
was
itself
a
pure
question
of
federal
law
in
the...
in
the
last
analysis
because
the
issue
ultimately
decided
by
the
court
was
the
inherently
federal
question
of
whether
federal
law
should
apply
to
this
case.
and,
and
this
court
has
often
stated
that
the
issue
of
whether
federal
law
applies
to
a
particular
case
is,
is
itself
always
a
federal
question.
mr.
james
e.
harrington
oh,
no.
no,
because
there,
there
i
don't
think
the,
the
court
ever
faces
the...
that's
a
clear...
as
i
conceded
in
response
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
i
don't
think
the
question
would
even
be
argued
or
presented
that
that
clause...
that
the
interpretation
of
that
clause
would
lead
to
an
application
of
federal
law.
mr.
james
e.
harrington
well,
our
case
where
it
says
law
of
the
place
where
the
project
is
located.
additionally,
a
case
in
which--
mr.
james
e.
harrington
--right.
well,
in...
in
our
case,
it
has
to
be
interpreted.
in
that
case,
although
i
guess
technically
it
has
to
be
interpreted,
the
meaning
is
so
obvious
i
don't
think
there
would
be
much
argument
about
it.
mr.
james
e.
harrington
if
the
contract
specified
the
law
of
vermont?
mr.
james
e.
harrington
oh,
yes.
i,
i
would
think
that
federal
law--
mr.
james
e.
harrington
--that
the
meaning
of
the
contract
is
a
federal
question?
mr.
james
e.
harrington
yes,
that
it
would
be
a
federal
question...
no.
it
is
not
a
federal
question
of
what
that
means
in
most
situations.
it
is
a
federal
question--
mr.
james
e.
harrington
--because...
because
federal
law
would
just
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
whole--
mr.
james
e.
harrington
--yes,
yes.
mr.
james
e.
harrington
i
think
that...
that...
well,
let
me...
yes,
i
think
that's
correct.
that's
correct.
if
it
said
the
law
of
vermont,
and
one
could...
one
could
say
that--
mr.
james
e.
harrington
--in
several
lower
courts--
mr.
james
e.
harrington
--several
of
the
lower
courts
have
said
that
that
type
of
choice-of-law
specification
includes
the
laws
of
the
federal
government
because
they're
an
inherent
part
of
the
law
of
every
state.
and...
and
it
would
be...
since
the...
if
the
argument
in
the
case...
that's
where
i
got
off
on
your
question,
justice
scalia.
i
think
that...
it's...
it's...
the
interpretation
of
the
choice-of-law
clause
will
be
a
federal
question
only
if
the
question
in
the
case
is
whether
that
choice-of-law
clause
encompasses
federal
law
or
whether
it
precludes
the
application
of
federal
law.
and
that's
my
second
ground
that
i
was
about
to
get
into.
in
other
words,
i
think
what
we...
the
court
has
often
used
the
"interwoven"
in
its
adequate
and
independent
state
ground
cases,
if
the
state
ground
is
so
interwoven
with
federal
law.
i
think
we
have
a
situation
in
here,
in
this
case,
in
which
the...
the
state
ground
is
interwoven
at
both
ends
of
the
analysis.
in
the
first
place,
my
first
point
was
that
you
can't
really
decide
what
the
phrase
means
unless
the
initial
step
in
your
syllogism
is
that
federal
law
is
the
law
of
the
place
where...
is
or
isn't
a
law
of
the
place
where
the
project
is
located,
and
that's
a
federal
question.
and
the
whole
aim
of
the
court's
analysis...
in
between
there,
there's
a
contract
interpretation,
but
the
ultimate
thing
the
court
is
after...
the
court
of
appeal...
in
trying
to
decide
what
this
thing
means,
what
this
provision
means,
in
relation
to
the
application
of
federal
law
is
whether
federal
law
should
be
applied
to
the
case.
sort
of
at
both
ends
it's
interwoven
with
the
federal
question
of
whether
federal
law
applies
at
a
particular
place.
now,
i,
i
think
the
federal...
the...
excuse
me.
the
court
has
often
stated
in
its
decisions
that
the
question
of
whether
federal
law
applies
in
a
particular
case
is,
is
itself
a
federal
question.
and
i
would
submit
that
this
general
principle
should
not
be
rendered
any
less
applicable
simply
because
the
question
comes
presented
to
the
court
in
the
guise
of
a
contract
interpretation
of
a
choice-of-law
problem.
in
the
first
place
when
the
so-called
choice-of-law
problem
is
a
choice
between
the
law
of
the
united
states
and
the
law
of
a
state,
it's
not
the
ordinary
kind
of
choice-of-law
problem,
but
is
instead
simply
a,
a
question
of
federal
supremacy
or
federal
preemption.
and
i
don't
think
the...
the
state
courts
clearly
should
not
have
the
final
say
in
resolving
that
kind
of
choice-of-law
problem
unless
they
are
to
be
given
the
final
say
over
all
supremacy
clause
issues.
and
secondly,
i
would
submit
that
this
conclusion
is
not
altered
by
the
fact
that
the
state
court's
choice
between
state
and
federal
law
may
have
been
implemented
by
means
of
a...
of
an
interpretation
of
a
choice-of-law
provision
in
a
contract
between
the
parties.
although
the
immediate
question
addressed
by
the
state
court
in
such
a
case
is
the
state
law
matter
of
interpreting
a
contract,
the
ultimate
issue
decided
by
the
court
is
whether
federal
law
shall
apply
to
the
case,
and
that
i
would
submit
is,
is
a
federal
issue
on
which
this
court
and
not
the
state
court
should
have
the
last
word.
in
fact,
i
think
that
any
other
conclusion
would...
would
erode
to
a
significant
extent
this
court's
position
as
the,
the
final
arbiter
of
all
issues
of
preemption
and
of
the
application
of
the
supremacy
clause.
choice-of-law
clauses
are
used
with
increasing
frequency
in
commercial
contracts,
and
any...
therefore,
any
rule
that
would
accord
the
state
courts
final
authority
to
determine
whether
such
provisions
foreclose
the
application
of
federal
law
and
prevent
federal
preemption
of
state
statutes
would
give
the
state
courts
the
power
of
final
disposition
of
a
very
large
proportion
of
supremacy
clause
and
preemption
cases.
mr.
james
e.
harrington
that's
correct.
mr.
james
e.
harrington
simply
because
this
court
has
jealously
guarded
over
the
decades
its
right
to
determine
the
application
of
the
supremacy
clause
and
decide
when...
when
federal
law
shall
apply
to
a
case
and
when
state
law
shall
be
preempted.
if,
if...
you
know,
if
the
matter...
if
the
parties
do
it
and
the
matter
never
reaches
a
court,
it's
not
a
legal
issue
at
all
i
suppose.
but
as
between
who
has
the
power,
as
between
this
court
and
the
state
courts,
to
decide
whether
federal
law
governs
a
case,
i
would
submit
it's
this
court.
now,
i
emphasize
this
is
the
broadest
rationale
we've
offered.
we've
offered
several
narrower
rationales
in
our
briefs
for
sustaining
the
court's
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
and
one
of
those
i
think
is
the
logical
dependence
argument
i
mentioned
at
the
outset.
i'm
not...
i
sense
that
justice
scalia
is
still
having
trouble
with
that
argument,
but
i--
mr.
james
e.
harrington
--i
don't
know
how
to
take
that.
finally,
in
any
case
i
would
submit
whatever
might
be
the
proper
disposition
of
this
issue
in
the
general
run
of
cases,
i...
federal
law
should
at
least
be
deemed
to
govern
the
question
whether...
the
question
of
the
effect
of
a
choice-of-law
clause
on
the
application
of
federal
law
when
the
state
court's
interpretation
of
the
clause
does
not
depend
upon
or
even
implicate
any,
any
general
state
law
principles
of
the
law
of
contracts,
but
instead
consists
simply
of
a
conclusory
pronouncement
that
we
have
no
doubt
that
a
certain
kind
of
choice-of-law
clause
excludes
federal
law.
in
that
kind
of
a
case
at
the
least
i
would
submit
that
the
state
court's
so-called
interpretation
of
the
contract
really
amounts
to
nothing
more
than
a
naked
declaration
by
the
state
court
whether
federal
law
shall
or
shall
not
apply
to
the
states.
and,
and
that
question
is
certainly
not
one
of
state
law,
but
one
that
this
court
should
have
jurisdiction
to
review
and
decide.
as
to
the
state
of
the,
the
state
of
the
authorities
on
this
issue,
the
court
has
never
expressly
or
directly
addressed
the
question
of
whether
federal
law
should,
should
govern
the
effect
of
a
choice-of-law
clause
on
federal
preemption.
but
i
think
the
court
has
given
two
very
strong
indications
in
its
recent
decisions
that
this
issue
should,
indeed,
be
governed
by,
by
federal
law.
one
of
these
appears
in
the
court's
recent
decision
in
mitsubishi
motors
v.
soler
chrysler-plymouth
where
the
court
expressly
suggested
that
a
choice-of-law
clause
that
right
preclude
the
application
of
federal
law
should
be
treated
as
an...
as
the
practical
equivalent
of
a
waiver
or
a
release
of
a
party's
federal
rights.
and
if
that
is
so,
then
it
would
follow
the
interpretation
of
such
a
clause
would
be
a
federal
question
since
the
effect
of
a
waiver
or
release
has
long
been
recognized
as
presenting
a
federal
question.
more
importantly,
in
the
court's
1982
decision
in
the
de
la
cuesta
case,
the
court
actually
decided,
albeit
implication...
albeit
by
implication
that
the...
the
very
issue
presented
in
this
case
is,
indeed,
a
federal
question
that
it
has
jurisdiction
to
review.
as
the
court
recalls
in
that
case,
the
court
undertook
to
interpret
for
itself
a
choice-of-law
clause
virtually
identical
to
the
one
involved
in
this
volt-stanford
contract
even
though
the
state
court
of
appeal
in
that
case
had...
had
previously
arrived
at
a
precisely
contrary
interpretation
of
the
clause.
i
think
by
undertaking
to
interpret
that
clause
in
that
case
without
indicating
any
doubt
about
its
jurisdiction
to
do
so--
mr.
james
e.
harrington
--the
word
used
there
was
"jurisdiction".
mr.
james
e.
harrington
oh,
no.
it
was
in
a
private
contract--
mr.
james
e.
harrington
--that
the
parties
were
not
required
to
use.
that's...
i...
in
fact,
one
of
the
contracts
in
the
case...
in
one
of
the
contracts
in
the
case,
the
parties
didn't
use
it.
and
then
the
court
even
indicated
in
its
opinion
in
de
la
cuesta
that
they
could
modify
the
terms
of
that
contract.
it
was
a
form
prepared
by
the
federal
government,
but
it
was
entered
into
by
private
parties
voluntarily.
mr.
james
e.
harrington
i...
as
i
read
the
opinion,
of
course,
i...
i've
never
had
access
to
the
record,
but
the
opinion
indicates
that
the
parties
were
not
required
to
enter
into
that
contract.
and,
in
fact,
in
one
of
the
transactions--
mr.
james
e.
harrington
--it
was?
pardon
me?
mr.
james
e.
harrington
it
was
promulgated
by,
by
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board,
but
the
parties
were
free
to--
mr.
james
e.
harrington
--well,
i,
i
know
from
my
own
experience
in
the
construction
area,
you
know,
the
federal
government
promulgates
construction
contracts,
and
then
those
frequently
end
up
being
used
between
the
contractor
and
his
subcontractors.
but
nobody
contends
that
those
are
federal
contracts
or
mandate
the
application
of
federal
law
if
they're
not
contracts
with
the
federal
government.
just
because
the
parties
used
a
form
that
came
from
the
federal
government,
i
don't
think
it
would
distinguish
the
de
la
cuesta
case.
mr.
james
e.
harrington
it
was--
mr.
james
e.
harrington
--well,
the
way
it...
it
was...
it
was...
if
the...
if
the...
the
homeowner
wanted
to
sell
the
mortgage
or,
or...
excuse
me.
if
the
lender
wanted
to
sell
the
mortgage
to
other
federal
agencies,
they
would
only
buy
it
if
it...
if
it
was
on
that
form.
but
the
contract
was
not
required
to
be
used
in
order
to
make
a
mortgage
by
a
federal
s&l.
and
in
one
of
the
cases
it
was
not
used,
and
the
court
actually
indicated
in
its
opinion
that
the
parties
could
have
modified
its
terms
if
they
pleased.
mr.
james
e.
harrington
so,
at
any
rate,
my
second
point
is
de
la
cuesta.
and
i...
it
appears
i'm
going
to
have
to
leave
the
other
points
unless
the...
the
other
three
issues
because
i'd
like
to
save
at
least
a
couple
of
minutes
for
rebuttal
unless
any
member
of
the
court
has
questions.
i
think
we've
gotten
into
the
actual
merits
of
the
interpretation.
mr.
james
e.
harrington
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
e.
harrington
a
one-sentence
response
to
the
last
point.
a
state
statute
which
states
that
an
arbitration
agreement
shall
not
be
enforced
at
all
in
certain
circumstances
is
not
a
procedural
provision;
it's
a
substantive
obstacle
to
arbitration
of
precisely
the
same
kind
that
was
held
preempted
by
this
court
in
southland
and
perry.
and
that's
what
this
state
statute
says.
it
says
you
can't
enforce
arbitration
at
all
in
certain
circumstances.
second
point,
mr.
heilbron
has
made
much
of
what
the
parties
agreed
to,
but
it's
clear
what
the
parties
agreed
to
in
this
content...
in
this
context
in
any
ordinary
layman
sense
was
to
agree
to
arbitrate
their
disputes
with
no
exceptions,
qualifications,
whatever.
all
disputes
are
to
be
arbitrable.
the...
this,
this
clause
was
custom-crafted
by
stanford
with...
with
a
clear
awareness
of
this
very
situation
involving
third-party
disputes
in
mind
and
yet
it
was
drafted
in
such
a
way
that
the
duty
to
arbitrate
would
remain
intact
in
that
situation
though
stanford
had
the
opportunity,
which
was
taken
by
the
parties
in
the
garden
grove
case
mr.
heilbron
referred
to,
to
exempt
themselves
from
arbitration
if
there
were
third
party
disputes.
that
wasn't
done.
the
parties
deliberately
agreed
to
arbitrate
in
that
situation.
stanford
now
claims
that
they
should
be
relieved
of
that
because
they--
