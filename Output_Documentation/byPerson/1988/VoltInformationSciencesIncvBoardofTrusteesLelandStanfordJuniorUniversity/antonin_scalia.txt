justice
antonin
scalia
a
question
of
chinese
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
what...
you
wouldn't
think
it
was
a
question
of
chinese
law
though?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
you
don't.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
confusing
what
is
the
fact,
which
is
a
federal
question,
is
federal
law
law
in
california.
i
suppose
that
is
a
federal
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
confusing
the
fact
with
what
the
parties
meant,
and
what
the
parties
meant
is
in
no
way
a
federal
question.
it's
simply
a
question
of
california
law.
did
the
parties
mean
federal
law
or
state
law?
why
is
that
a
federal
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's...
that's
true
only
if
you
take
the
preliminary
step
of
saying
that
place
means
all
laws
that
apply
to
that
place,
but
that
is
precisely
the
question
before
the
court.
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
state
law
question.
does
place
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--law
of
the
place
mean
all
laws
applicable
to
the
place
or
only
the
state
law
applicable
to
the
place?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
because
of
the
fact--
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
law
of
vermont?
go,
go
back
to
that
earlier
example.
you
said
very
clearly
that's,
of
course,
not
a
federal
question.
why
isn't
it?
federal
law
is
law
in
vermont.
why
isn't
there
an
ambiguity
there?
why
doesn't
that
raise
a
federal
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
contract
shall
be
governed
by
the
law
of
vermont.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
federal
question
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
federal
law
is
law...
it
governs
in
vermont.
why
isn't
it
possible
to
interpret
that
saying
all
the
law
of
vermont,
including
the
law
of
the
united
states,
which
is
law
in
vermont?
isn't
that
argument
available?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
therefore,
there's
a
federal
question
raised.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
lot
of
contracts--
justice
antonin
scalia
--are
going
to
be
raising
federal
questions.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
giving
that
to
the
parties.
i
mean,
you're
by
definition
dealing
with
situations
in
which
the
parties,
if
they
speak
clearly
enough,
can
oust
federal
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why...
why
should
it
be
so
terrible
that
the
states
should
be
given
the
interpretation
of
those
provisions?
you're,
you're
allowing
individuals
to
oust
federal
law.
what's
so
horrible
about
allowing
a
state
to
oust
federal
law
by
interpreting
the
contract?
justice
antonin
scalia
xxx
any
trouble
with
it
at
all.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
we
could
adopt
a
theory
that
whether
in
a
particular
contract
parties
have
contracted
out
of
federal
law--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
would
otherwise
be
applicable
is
itself
a
question
of
federal
law.
i
don't
know
any
case
that
has
ever
held
that,
but,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
thinkable.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let's
say...
let's
say
the
issue
in
a
state
case
is
whether...
state
criminal
cases...
whether
the
defendant
waived
a
particular
federal
constitutional
right
that
is
waivable.
we
would...
we
would
examine
that
as
a
federal...
whether
he
voluntarily
gave
away
that
federal
entitlement.
we
would
consider
that
a
question
of
federal
law.
and
you
can
say
this
is
the
same
thing
here.
did
these
parties
voluntarily
contract
out
of
their
otherwise
applicable
federal
entitlements?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
talking
about
a
state
procedural
rule.
i'm
talking
about
a,
a
statement
that
the
individual
made
saying
i
don't
want
an
attorney.
justice
antonin
scalia
something
like
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
the
meaning
of
that
statement?
that's
the
issue
in
the
case.
did
he
really
say
he
didn't
want
an
attorney
or
did
it
mean
something
else?
we've
had
some
cases
recently
that
involved
this
kind
of
question.
we
certainly
consider
that
a
federal
question
even
though
it
arises
in
a
state
proceeding.
it's
just
a
meaning...
interpretation
of
language.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
since
it
affects
federal
rights,
we
say
it's
a
federal
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
isn't
just
a
matter
of
choosing.
it's
a
matter
of
contracting
out
of
federal
law.
the
preexisting
state
of
the
world
is
that
the
federal
arbitration
act
governs,
and
the
issue
is
whether
the
parties
have
contracted
out
of
the
federal
arbitration
act.
i
don't
think
it's
unthinkable
to
hold
that
the
question
of
whether
they
have
contracted
out
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
is
a
federal
question.
