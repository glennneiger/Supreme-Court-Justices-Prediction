justice
byron
r.
white
--why...
the
real...
one
of
the
questions
here
is
what
does
the
word
"place"
mean.
and
why
wouldn't...
why
wouldn't
california
law
apply
to,
to,
to
deciding
what
place
means?
and
under
california
law,
if
there's
a
contract
that
says
place,
it
means
the
state
of
california.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
federal
law
have
anything,
anything
at
all
to
do
with...
with
deciding
what
the
word
"place"
means
in
a
california--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
it
doesn't
under
california
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
arguing...
you're
just
arguing
jurisdiction
right
now.
all
you
have
to
do--
justice
byron
r.
white
--is
to
say
there
was
a
colorable
issue
of
federal
law
to
sustain
jurisdiction.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
you're
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
merits,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
--that
just
renders
that
phrase
meaningless.
it
renders
it
meaningless.
why
have
it
in,
in
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
at
least
it
would
narrow
what
you
say
to
california
or
united
states
law.
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
used
in
a...
used
in
a
federal
regulation.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
may
be,
but
it
was
a...
it
was
a
kind
of
a
contract
that
was
required
by
a
federal
regulation.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
a
federal
term
nevertheless,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
who,
who...
was
it
a
form
contract
prepared
by...
by
whom?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
why
the
word
"place"...
so,
i
would--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
i...
i
thought
in
that
case,
the
contract--
justice
byron
r.
white
--it
was
a
form
that
was
mandated
by
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx.
as
i
understand
the
decision,
the
california
courts
said
the
word...
when
you
say
the
law
of
the
place,
you
mean
the
law
of
the
state--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
not
the
federal
government--
justice
byron
r.
white
--or
anything
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
why...
why
isn't
that
the
end
of
the
case
because
surely
california
should
be
able
to
interpret
the
word
"place"
as...
and
construe
that
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
there
either
has
to
be
an
arbitration
clause
in
the
contract
or
you
don't
have
to
arbitrate.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
was
an
arbitration
clause
in
this
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
it
just
happened
to
turn
out,
although
the
lawyers
should
have
been
pretty
dumb
if...
what
if
it
turned
out
that
california
had
a
law
against
any
arbitration
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then...
but
there
was
still
a...
a
provision
for
arbitration.
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
this...
they
say
that
the...
this
contract
shall
be
construed
and
enforced
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
the
place
where
it's
made.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
they
have
an
arbitration
clause,
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
turns
out
that
california
doesn't
allow
any
arbitration.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
question
is
must
you
arbitrate?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
they've
agreed
to
arbitrate.
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
as
a
forum
selection
clause
and...
but
with
an
arbitration
clause,
the
state
courts
must
provide
for
arbitration.
justice
byron
r.
white
right,
right.
all
right,
but...
but
they
can't
prevent
arbitration.
they,
they
can't
refuse
in
the
face
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
to
order
arbitration.
justice
byron
r.
white
right,
right.
