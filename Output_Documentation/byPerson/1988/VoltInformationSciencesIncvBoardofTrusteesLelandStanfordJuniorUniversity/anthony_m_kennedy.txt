if,
if
the
parties
had
said
that
the
california
code
of
civil
procedure
shall
govern
the
enforcement
of
arbitration
award,
i
take
it
you
wouldn't
be
here,
that
you
would
concede
that
the
federal
law
is
displaced,
or
would
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
somehow
you
were
subject
to
the
federal
act...
to
the
federal
arbitration
act,
you...
you
would
not
have
had
the
option
that
the
california
code
of
civil
procedure
gives
you
i
take
it,
or
would
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
agreement
had
not
had
a
place
provision
in
it,
and--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
volt
had
gone
to
a
federal
court,
i
assume
you
would
have
been
forced
to
arbitrate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on,
on
that
point,
if
in
this
case
under
this
contract,
say
it
were
just
volt
and
stanford,
just
two
parties
involved,
you
had
gone
to
arbitration--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--under
this
contract--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--could
the
prevailing
party
have
gone
to
federal
court
to
seek
enforcement
of
the
award
under
the
federal
arbitration
act?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
and
then
you
seek
to
enforce
the
award.
could
you
go
under
the
federal
act?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
and
you
have
the
finding
that
you
have
by
the
state
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
you
don't
read
the
opinion
as
making
the
federal
arbitration
act
completely
irrelevant
to
this
contract?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
your
view
that
would
not
encompass
enforcement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we,
we
can
and
do
reach
questions
of
state
contract
interpretation
and
reexamine
them
here
if
they're
a
bar
to
the
assertion
of
a
federal
right
such
as
the
right
not
to
have
your
contracts
impaired.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
indiana
v.
brand.
could
the...
could
volt
make
the
argument
here...
i
suppose
it
does
make
the
argument
here...
that
there
is
a
federal
policy
in
favor
of
federally
enforced
arbitration
anti
that
we're,
therefore,
entitled
to
reach
the
state
question
in
order
to
make
sure
that
that
policy
is
not
thwarted?
