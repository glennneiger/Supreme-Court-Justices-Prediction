mr.
david
m.
heilbron
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
had
a
flesh
and
blood
problem
here.
volt
charged
that
stanford
was
liable
because
the
project
manager
mismanaged
the
job
and
the
engineer
designed
it
badly.
now,
if
volt
hurt
itself...
and
stanford
thought
it
did...
it
ought
to
suffer
its
losses.
and
if
the
project
manager
and
the
engineer
hurt
volt,
they
ought
to
pay
for
its
losses.
but
no
way,
either
way
ought
stanford
to
have
to
pay
for
them.
however,
if
volt's
claim
against
stanford
were
arbitrated
alone,
volt
might
win
it,
and
if
stanford's
claim
over
as
against
the
project
manager
and
the
engineer
were
litigated
alone,
they
might
win
it.
and
so,
stanford
could
lose
both
ways
with
the
consequence
that
it
would
have
to
pay
for
those
losses
it
ought
in
no
way
to
have
to
pay
for.
and
that
result
would
be
very
unjust
and
the
statute,
1281.2(c),
as
justice
blackmun
i
believe
observed,
is
really
made
for
just
exactly
that
unjust
case.
mr.
david
m.
heilbron
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
not
a
matter
of
record
before
the
court
here.
my
recollection
is
that
the
statute
was
proposed
by
the
state
bar
about
six
or
seven
years
ago,
and
its
purpose...
and
this
is
again
not
in
the
record.
its
purpose
is
to
avoid
piecemeal
litigation
and
the
wasted
time
and
resources
that
it
causes
and
the
conflicting
rulings
of
common...
as
to
common
questions
of
law
and
fact
that
it
permits.
so,
that's
where
the
statute
came
from,
your
honor.
mr.
david
m.
heilbron
well,
for
openers
the
answer
is
that
we
agree
that
california
law
was
to
govern
here.
the
court
found
that
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
fact
that
place
meant
what
the
court
found--
mr.
david
m.
heilbron
--had
the
agreement
not
spoken
to
california
law--
mr.
david
m.
heilbron
--had
volt...
had
there
been
no
agreement,
had
the
agreement
not
met
what
the
court
found
it
to
have
meant,
and
had
we
been
in
a
federal
court,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes.
but
had
we
been
in
a
state
court,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
no.
and
we
were
in
a
state
court.
and
the
reason,
getting
ahead
of
the
story
a
little
bit,
is
that
sections
3
and
4
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
have
never
been
held
by
this
court
to
apply
in
state
court,
and
they
never
should
be.
mr.
david
m.
heilbron
yes.
mr.
david
m.
heilbron
yes.
mr.
david
m.
heilbron
had
we
gone
to
arbitration,
just
the
two
of
us?
mr.
david
m.
heilbron
do
we
by
this
hypothesis
have
the
agreement
that
we
had?
mr.
david
m.
heilbron
well,
we
believe
that
the
thrust
of
what
the
parties
said
here...
that
is,
that
california
law
was
to
obtain...
would
cause
them
rightly
to
go
into
the
state
court
to
have
the
award
enforced.
but
whether
the
thrust
of
the
agreement
was
as
broad
as
your
honor's
question
suggests
it
was
was
a
question
not
canvassed
in
the
court
below
because
it
didn't
have
to
be.
the
core
point--
mr.
david
m.
heilbron
--no.
what,
what
we
read
the
court's
decision
to
be...
its
finding
as
to
what
the
parties
meant
to
be...
is
that
the
california
law,
including
1281.2(c),
was
to
apply
to
the
parties
agreement
and
to
the
arbitration
called
for
by
the
agreement
or
not
dependent
upon
how
1281.2(c)--
mr.
david
m.
heilbron
--it
may
well,
and
it
is
our
view
that
it
does.
but
it
is
also
our
view
that
the
court
didn't
reach
the
question.
it
wasn't
argued
below
because
we
didn't
have
to.
but
it
would
be
our
view,
yes,
that
it
would...
it
would
catch...
the
agreement
would...
all
of
california
law
which
really
went
to
the
substance
of
the
agreement
to
arbitrate,
including
1281.2(c).
and
whether
in
a
federal
court,
were
one
to
go
in
there
and
ask
to
seek
to
have
an
award
enforced,
one
could
say
in
a
federal
court,
well,
the
mechanism
as
to
how
you
enforce
the
agreement
was
not
something
that
the
parties
cared
about
is
something,
as
i
say,
we
did
not
face
in
the
court
below
because
it
wasn't
present
in
the
case.
i'm
not
sure
i've
been
clear
to
your
honor.
well,
assuming
that
the
agreement
meant
that
the
court
found
it
to
mean,
the
question
is
whether
the
faa
really
forces
private
people
who
agree
to
arbitrate
in
accordance
with
state
law
to
arbitrate
in
accordance
with
federal
law
instead.
and
specifically,
does
the
faa
prohibit
a
state
court
from
enforcing
the
agreement
that
these
parties
made
to
solve
the
problem
they
had
in
the
common
sense
way
that
state
law
does?
now,
that's
a
federal
question.
that
is
a
federal
question.
but
the
answer
to
it
is
very
clear.
the
answer
is
plain
no.
arbitration
is
a
matter
of
agreement.
that's
the
most
basic,
most
cherished
principle
of
arbitration
law,
federal
and
state.
parties
can
agree
to
arbitrate
in
any
way
they
want.
they
can
agree
to
arbitrate
in
some
circumstances
and
not
all,
some
disputes
and
not
all,
or
not
at
all.
and
the
court
cannot
force
parties
to
arbitrate
a
dispute
they
haven't
agreed
to
arbitrate
or
in
the
way
or
under
circumstances
in
which
they
have
not
agreed
to
arbitrate.
mr.
david
m.
heilbron
there
was
no
extrinsic
evidence
offered.
it
was
agreed
in,
in
essence
that
the
contract
was
there
to
be
interpreted
by
the
court
in
the
common
sense
way
that
it
did.
we
argued
about
what
it
meant.
but
one
should
have
an...
in
mind
that
there
was
a
factual
backdrop
here,
and
that
was
that
the
year
before
this
contract
was
made,
the
california
court
of
appeal
in
the
garden
grove
case
had
interpreted
essentially
the
same
provision
in
essentially
the
same
contract
in
essentially
the
same
way
as
this
court
did.
and
the
parties,
the
court
found,
could
be
taken
to
have
known
about
that
and,
therefore,
to
have
had
in
mind
when
they
struck
the
deal
that
they
struck,
that
that's
what
the
words
meant.
so,
it
was
not
as
if
this
was
kind
of
out
of
the
blue
and
there
was
no
history
here.
there
was
a
clear
history.
the
court
of
appeal
was
clear
as
to
it
and
thought
it
meant
something.
now,
before
i,
i
leave
the
question
of
jurisdiction...
and
i
want
to
talk
just
a
moment
about
the
proposition
that
arbitration
of
agreement.
but
before
leaving
the
question
of
jurisdiction
to
come
back
at
it
when
we
get
to
what
the
contract
means,
i'd
like
to
remind
the
court
that
this
purports
to
be
a
1257(2)
appeal.
this
is
not
an
appeal.
the
appellant,
so
he
calls
himself,
has
made
it
very
clear
to
this
court
that
what's
really
on
his
mind
is
what
this
contract
meant
and
why
it
really
doesn't
mean
what
the
court
found
it
means.
and
what
a
contract
means
is
not
a
question
which
goes
to
the
validity
of
a
statute,
and
consequently
it
does
not
give
rise
to
a
1257(2)
appeal.
the
federal
question
that
we've
got
here
is,
is,
is
a
question,
all
right,
but
there
is
nothing
to
it.
there's
no
substance
to
it,
and
therefore
it's
not
the
kind
of
question
that
this
court
ought
to
review
under
its
certiorari
jurisdiction,
and
the
case
simply
ought
to
go
away.
now,
just
a...
just
a
few
words
more
about
the
proposition
that
arbitration
is
a
matter
of
agreement.
nothing
in
the
faa
obviously
changes
that
proposition.
the
faa
puts
arbitration
agreements
on
the
same
footing
as
other
contracts
but
not
more
so.
it's
meant
to
enforce
parties'
agreements
according
to
their
terms,
whatever
their
terms
are,
no
less
but
no
more
than
they
are.
and
those
are
familiar
principles
to
the
court,
of
course.
every
case
from
prima
paint
through
perry
says
exactly
that.
no
case
says
otherwise,
and
dean
witter
sums
it
up.
that's
the
preeminent
purpose
of
the
act.
the
act
does
not
mandate
people
to
arbitrate.
it
just
says
that
it
wants
to
enforce
agreements
that
parties
have
made.
and
the
liberal
policy
favoring
arbitration
that
mr.
harrington
referred
to
is,
as
the
mitsubishi
case
puts
it,
just
at
bottom
a
policy
guaranteeing
the
enforcement
of
private
agreements.
this,
this
court...
this
court
simply
interpreted
the
parties'
agreement
in
accordance
with
its
terms,
exactly
what
it
ought
to
have
done
under
this
court's
principles
of
law,
exactly
what
the
letter
and
the
spirit
of
the
faa
command,
and
there's
simply
nothing
to
argue
about
here.
and
finally,
as
to
that
point,
they
proved
it
today.
they
proved
it
in
their
brief,
but
they
proved
it
again
today.
the
question
was
put
to
mr.
harrington,
look,
if
the
parties
had
clearly
agreed
to
be
bound
by
state
law,
would
that
be
okay?
and
he
said
yes.
in
their
brief
they
said,
you
know,
you
could
have
accomplished
what
you
say
you
accomplished
longhand
just
by
in
so
many
words
setting
forth
1281.2(c),
but
you
didn't
do
that,
and
in
the
process
proving
again
that
there's
simply
nothing
of
substance
at
issue
here
because
if
you
can
achieve
the
goal
longhand,
what
earthly
difference
does
it
make
whether
you
achieve
it,
as
we
did,
shorthand?
mr.
david
m.
heilbron
that's
true.
mr.
david
m.
heilbron
that's
true.
mr.
david
m.
heilbron
that
is
true.
mr.
david
m.
heilbron
why,
we
think
that's
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
there's,
there's
just
no
question
about
it.
i
mean,
when
it...
when
it
comes
down
to
it
at
the
end,
they
say
the
reason
why
the
contract,
assuming
it
made...
it
meant
what
we
have
just
been
assuming
it
meant,
is
unenforceable
is
because
maybe
we
really
didn't
know
what
we
were
doing.
that
was
the
ultimate
proposition
put
on
oral
argument
and
really
just
beside
the
point.
it
is
the
case
that
it's
a
california
question
what
the
word
"place"
means
in
a
contract
made
between
citizens
of
california.
and
it
having
made
the
judgment...
the
court...
finding
without
doubt
that
the
contract
word
"place"
meant
the
laws
of
the
place
california
where
the
project
was
located,
and
they
having
agreed
that
that
agreement,
if
we
made
it,
is
okay,
that's
really
all
there
is
to
the
case.
mr.
david
m.
heilbron
absolutely,
your
honor.
that
is
a
federal
question.
we
grant
that
it
is,
and
the
answer
to
it
is
obviously
yes.
certainly
parties
can
agree
to
arbitrate
in
any
way
in
the
world
they
want
to
agree
to
arbitrate
or
they
can
agree
not
to
arbitrate
at
all.
and
if
what
they
agree
to
do
is
to
arbitrate
in
accordance
with
california
law,
there's
no
federal
interest
that
says
they
can't
do
that.
indeed,
the
federal
interest
is
to
the
contrary.
the
federal
interest
is
enforcing
their
agreement
in
accordance
with
its
terms,
and
that's
what
the
court
below
did.
mr.
david
m.
heilbron
that
is
true.
mr.
david
m.
heilbron
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
m.
heilbron
well--
mr.
david
m.
heilbron
--are
we
assuming
in
this
hypothetical,
your
honor,
that
there
is
an
agreement?
mr.
david
m.
heilbron
yes.
mr.
david
m.
heilbron
okay.
mr.
david
m.
heilbron
and
the
question
is
whether
the
agreement
would
still
mean
what
we
say
it
meant?
mr.
david
m.
heilbron
well,
the
answer
is
that
if
the
parties
meant
to
incorporate
that
provision
of
california
law
that
said
there
shall
be
no
arbitration...
that's
what
they
meant...
then
that's
what
should
happen
because
a
court
cannot
enforce
the
parties
to
do
something
they
have
not
agreed
to
do.
mr.
david
m.
heilbron
so,
if
the
court
in
construing
the
clause
has
in
mind
the
illogic
of
what
your
honor
is
pointing
to
and
decides
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
these
parties
really
could
not
have
intended
that
in
the
setting
that
your
honor
puts,
then
the
court
comes
to
the
judgment
that's
not
what
the
choice-of-law
clause
means
here.
again,
a
state
law
question
to
be
answered
by
state
law
and
perhaps
differently
from
the
way
in
which
this
state
court
answered
this
state
question.
a
few
more
words
about
what
the
agreement
means.
now,
they
say
that
the
reason
why
this
is
a
federal
question
here
is
that
federal
law
kind
of
applies
every
place,
and
that
if
one
doesn't
interpret
this
contract
in
accordance
with
that
literal
meaning
of
the
word
"place",
you're
going
to
sort
of
undo
the
supremacy
clause.
you
will
no
longer
be,
i
think
it
was
said
today,
the
final
arbiter
of
questions
of
federal
supremacy.
and
that's
a
fear
one
can
be
disabused
of.
we
believe
in
the
supremacy
clause.
we
admire
it
like
everybody
else.
we
have
no
seditious
purpose
in
respect
to
it.
obviously
federal
law
is
supreme.
it's
also
obviously
the
case
that
the
supremacy
clause
really
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
issue
at
hand
and
neither
does
the
literal
meaning
of
the
words
and
neither
does
basic
tenets
of
federalism
they
refer
to
many
times
in
their
brief
because
the
question
is
just
what
the
parties
meant
here.
the
answer
turns
on
intent
not
the
constitution.
and
the
supremacy
clause
doesn't
tell
parties
what
they
intend,
and
what
they
intend
doesn't
effect
the
supremacy
clause.
state
law
ought
to
determine
what
the
parties
meant
here
for
the
same
common
sense
reasons
it
ordinarily
does,
as
they
agree.
the
state
is
close
to
what's
going
on
in
the
state,
to
the
contracts
that
are
made
there,
and
to
the
words
that
people
use
there.
mr.
david
m.
heilbron
yes.
mr.
david
m.
heilbron
well,
i
think
that
volt
could
make
the
argument,
if
they
made
it,
that
the
state
court's
interpretation
of
the
state
law
question
was,
for
want
of
a
better
word,
kind
of
wild,
so
unfounded
in
the
words
of
the
demorest
and
enterprise
irrigation
cases,
so
certainly
unfounded
that
what
the
court
did
may
properly
be
regarded
as
essentially
arbitrary
or
a
mere
device,
you
know,
kind
of
a
way
to
evade,
manipulate
around
the
application
of
a
federal
right.
and
if
there
were
that
going
on
here,
i
think
the
answer
to
your
honor's
question
would
be,
yes,
you
could
call
a
halt
to
it,
blow
a
whistle.
but
there's
nothing
like
that
remotely
that
went
on
here.
really
all
that
happened
was
that
against
a
backdrop
of
commonly
looked-to
california
rules
of
how
you
interpret
contracts,
the
court
interpreted
a
contract.
and
the
common
rule
is...
the
very
common
sense
rule...
that
words
are
to
be
interpreted
in
accordance
with
their
popular
meaning
not
in
their
strict
legal
sense,
and
they
are
supposed
to
be
interpreted
in
accordance
with
local
usage.
obviously,
that's
the
way
things
ought
to
be.
i
mean,
there's
no
sense
interpreting
words
used
one
place
the
way
they're
used
some
other
place.
and
so,
the
court
against
that
backdrop
simply
interpreted
the
common
sense
word
"place"
before
it
and
reached
the
judgment
that,
you
know,
place
where
the
project
is
located
means
california,
the
place
where
the
project
is
located,
a
matter
which
really
ought
not
to
have
to
occupy
this
court.
really
what
the
words,
you
know,
seem
naturally
to
say...
a
long
list
of
federal
statutes
that
use
them
in
essentially
the
same
way,
and
that
case,
garden
grove,
that
i
referred
to
earlier
had
interpreted
them
exactly
the
same
way
the
year
before.
now,
when
you
come
down
to
it,
it
seems
to
us
a
very
telling
point
here,
it
has
to
do
with
what
it
is
that
they
are
asking
you
to
do
in
respect
to
this
kind
of
earthy
little
state
law
question.
i
mean,
what
really
are
they
asking
you
to
do
here?
to
reinterpret
the
choice-of-law
clause
in
this
private
contract,
hold
that
the
words
mean
what
volt
says
they
mean
in
this
private
contract,
in
all
private
contracts
in
california
and
everywhere
else,
hold
that
because
that's
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
words
in
california
or
everywhere
else,
hold
that
whether
that's
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
words
in
california
or
anywhere
else?
and
it
really
would
be
unprincipled
for
the
court
to
undertake
to
do
that.
they
point
to
no
rule.
there
obvious
is
none
that
says
that
you're
supposed
to
interpret
popular
words
in
an
unpopular
way,
and
there's
nothing
before
the
court
to
suggest
to
it
that
people
have
ever
used
the
words
that
were
used
here
in
the
way
that
volt
says
they
were
used
here
in
the
entire
history
of
the
state
of
california.
so
much
for
what
the...
the
contract
means.
mr.
david
m.
heilbron
yes.
mr.
david
m.
heilbron
neither
do
they.
mr.
david
m.
heilbron
neither
do
they.
they
have
suggested
that
that
might
be
so,
but
cited
no
rule.
that
would
be
a
rather
odd
thing,
with
great
respect,
justice
scalia,
to
hold.
i
mean,
the
whole
backdrop
of
contract
law
in
the
united
states
is
that
private
parties
make
contracts
with
reference
to
state
law
for
the
very
good
reason
that
there
is
no
general
federal
contract
law.
swift
and
tyson
is
long
dead.
and
among
the
things
that
states
are
ordinarily
equipped
to
do
and
do
is
to
interpret
choices-of-law
clauses
in
agreements.
this
agreement
like
any
other...
there's
nothing
special
about
it.
mr.
david
m.
heilbron
well,
i
think
that
the...
that
the
applicable
rule
would
be...
if
you
were
worrying
about
whether
somebody
lost
a
federal
right
because
he
had
messed
up
in
respect
to
a
state
procedural
rule,
i
think
the
applicable
rule
would
be
is
that
state
procedural
rule
a
sound
rule
that's
generally
followed
or
is
it
a
mechanism
to
kind
of
take
away
a
federal
right.
mr.
david
m.
heilbron
oh,
i
see
what
you're
saying.
mr.
david
m.
heilbron
okay.
mr.
david
m.
heilbron
well,--
mr.
david
m.
heilbron
--i
think
it
is
quite
a
different
thing
to
say
that
it's
a
federal
question
as
to
whether
a
confession,
for
example,
is
coerced.
so,
you
look
at
the
facts
to
find
out
whether
they
fit
the
federal
rule.
i
think
that's
quite
different
from
the
case
where
parties
choose
a
body
of
law
to
have
their
problems
resolved
under.
and
when
they
choose
it,
they
certainly
do
not
expect
that
the
jurisdiction
whose
laws
they
have
not
chosen
is
going
to
determine
the
meaning
of
the
words
they
used
under
the
laws
of
the
jurisdiction
that
they
did
choose.
mr.
david
m.
heilbron
well,
it's
thinkable
in
the
sense
that
i
can
certainly
entertain
the
thought,
and
we
have
as
we
talk
with
one
another,
but
unthinkable
in...
in
this
sense,
that
you
are
still
dealing
with
a
state
law
contract
between
local
parties
using
local
words
in
a
local
setting.
and
what
those
words
mean
in
that
local
setting
is
really
a
local
question.
and
for
this
court,
so
far
away,
if
i
may
say
so,
from
that
local
setting
to
determine
what
those
locally
said
words
meant
locally
is
a
difficult
thing
to
do.
and
it's
for
that
reason
that
just
as
a
matter
of
common
sense
state
contract
provisions
are
interpreted
in
accordance
with
state
law,
this
one
as
any
other.
i'd
like
to
spend
a
word
or
two,
if
i
might,
in
respect
to
sections
3
and
4
of
the
act
and
whether
they
really
apply
here,
whether
or
not
had
we
not
had
any
agreement
at
all
it
would
make
really
any
difference,
the
question
that
justice
kennedy
posed
when
we
began.
and
the
answer
is
no.
three
and
4
would
not
apply
and
neither
would
moses
h.
cone's
piecemeal
litigation
apply
in
this
state
court
proceeding.
this
court
has
never
held
ever
that
sections
3
and
4
of
the
act
apply
in
a
state
court
proceeding,
and
it
ought
not
to
hold
that
they
do
this
time
around
for
at
least
three
reasons.
number
one,
sections
3
and
4
of
the
act
make
it
perfectly
clear
on
the
face...
on
their
face
that
they
apply
to
united
states'
courts,
united
states'
district
courts,
not
state
courts.
and
second,
the
legislative
history
shows
that
congress
meant
exactly
what
it
said.
there's
an
argument
in
the
brief
that
says,
well,
you
know,
so
what.
you
ought
to
apply
sections
3
and
4
in
state
courts
in
order
to
achieve
the
goals
of
the
act,
but
you
don't
achieve
the
goals
of
the
act
by
doing
the
opposite
of
what
congress
said
and
meant.
and
it
really
would
be
most
surprising
and
intrusive
had
congress
meant
otherwise,
that
is,
had
it
meant
those
procedural
rules
of
the
act
to
apply
in
state
court
because
it's
well-known
that
federal
law
generally
takes
state
courts
as
it
finds
them
and
the
remedies
that
a
forum
provides
are
ordinarily
the
business
of
the
forum
that
provides
them.
that's
just
the
way
the
system
works.
mr.
david
m.
heilbron
that
is
a
true
statement,
but
the--
mr.
david
m.
heilbron
--under
the
procedural
remedies
that
they
make
available
in
general.
mr.
david
m.
heilbron
absolutely
right.
the
proposition
here
is
simply
this.
the
procedural
remedy
that
this
state
court
provided
was
a
order
to
compel,
but
the
court
said,
look,
we're
not
going
to
issue
it
where
its
effect
will
be
to
cause
duplicative
litigation,
piecemeal
litigation,
maybe
inconsistent
judgments,
unfair
results.
the
rule
makes
sense.
it's
solves
the
flesh
and
blood
problem
that
we
talked
about
at
the
beginning,
and
its
purpose
is
benign.
and
the
faa
does
not
forbid
it,
and
it
would
be
astonishing
if
it
did
because
why
would
congress
in
1925
or,
for
that
matter,
ever
want
to
force
state
courts
to
issue
orders
to
compel
duplicative,
piecemeal
litigation
effecting
inconsistent
judgments
contrary
to
sensible
state
rules?
and
the
answer
is
there
is
no
way
that
congress
would
have
meant
to
do
that,
and
this
court
ought
not,
60
years
out,
after
the
fact
and
in
the
age
of
the
litigation
explosion,
hold
that
it
did.
but
to
end
at
the
beginning,
the
court
really
didn't...
needn't
reach
the
question.
we've
got
a
state
law
contract
here.
it
was
interpreted
properly
in
accordance
with
state
law
principles
by
the
state
court.
local
words
were
looked
at
by
a
local
court
to
find
out
what
they
meant.
the
court
enforced
the
parties'
agreement
in
accordance
with
its
terms,
exactly
what
the
court
was
supposed
to
have
done
under
every
case
this
court
has
ever
laid
down
in
respect
to
the
faa.
and
should
this
court
hold
that
it
ought
not
have
done
that,
it
would
really
turn
the
faa
upside
down.
thank
you
very
much.
