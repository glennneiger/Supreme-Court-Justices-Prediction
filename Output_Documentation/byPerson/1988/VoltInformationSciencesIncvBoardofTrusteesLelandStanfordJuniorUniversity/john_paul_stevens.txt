justice
john
paul
stevens
i
hate
to...
i
don't
mean
to
hold
you
on
this
point
too
long.
but
why
is
that
a
federal
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
a
contract
between
two
california
parties
provided
that
we
shall
have
this
contract...
all
issues
under
this
contract
shall
be
determined
by
the
law
of
vermont,
say.
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
it's
arguable
whether
it
means
vermont
or
massachusetts,
one
of
the
two.
why
is
the
question
of
what
that
means
a
question
of
vermont
or
massachusetts
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question,
kind
of
a
preliminary
question?
there
was
mention
made
by
your
opponent
of
the
fact
no
evidence
was
introduced
on
the
meaning
and
the
parties
and
so
forth.
did
anyone
seek
to
offer
any
evidence,
or
was
it
agreed
by
the
parties
that
the
contract
would
speak
for
itself
in
effect?
