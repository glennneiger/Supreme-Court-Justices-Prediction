we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
87-1318,
volt
information
sciences
v.
the
board
of
trustees
of
leland
stanford
junior
university.
mr.
harrington,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that...
i
don't
see
how
that
gets
away
from
the,
the
idea
this
is
basically
a
question
of
fact,
what
the
parties
meant
as
manifested
by,
by
the
use
of
the
phrase
you,
you
just
said.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
it...
if
a
california
court
interprets
general
language
used
by
parties
to
refer
to
some
kind
of
law
other
than
california
law,
it
automatically
becomes
a
question
of
law
of
some
other
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
that
a
contract
said
this
contract
is
going
to
be
arbitrated
either
in
tokyo
or
beijing,
whichever
is
the
larger
city.
and
this
is
a
california
contract
entered
into
by
california
people,
and
the
california
court
says,
well,
it
means
such
and
such.
well,
that
doesn't
mean
it's
not
a
question
of
california
law
anymore
because
it
refers
to,
to
places
outside
of
california,
does
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
if
the
parties
deliberately
exclude
federal
law,
as
they
have
in
justice
kennedy's
hypothesis...
they
say
the
arbitration
shall
be
governed
by
the
california
code
of
civil
procedure...
that
becomes
a
federal
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
but...
give
me
again
then
the
situation
where
you
say
it
does
present
a
federal
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
is
that
different
legally
from
justice
kennedy's
hypothesis?
each
of
them
is
trying
to
state
the
agreement
of
the
parties
about
what
law
shall
govern
their,
their
contract
or
their
arbitration.
one
chooses
one
set
of
words,
another
chooses
another
more
precise
set
of
words.
but
that
doesn't
make
it
not
a,
a
question
of
fact
or
a
question
of
what
these
parties
meant,
perhaps
a
question
of
law
in
the
sense
you
used
it
earlier.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
harrington.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
heilbron,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
there
remains
a
federal
question,
does...
although
you
say
it's
one
that
admits
of
a
very
easy
answer...
whether
that
sort
of
an
agreement
in
a
contract
can
prevent
the...
can
result
in
the
operation
of
california
arbitration
law
as
opposed
to
federal
arbitration
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
heilbron.
mr.
harrington,
you
have
one
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
harrington.
the
case
is
submitted.
