justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
goldberg,
didn't
the
court
recognized
in
the
terry
case
that
a
collection
of
possibly
innocent
actions
when
viewed
in
their
totality
can,
can
amount
to
reasonable
suspicion
to
justify
a
detention,
i
don't
think
the
court
has
ever
said
that
any
of
the
factors
couldn't
be
innocent
acts.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
facts
for
the...
supporting
the
initial
detention,
which
we
are
examining,
are
virtually
identical
to
royer,
aren't
they?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
why
should...
why
should
the
ninth
circuit
reach
a
different
result?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
the
court
found
in
royer
that
there
was
sufficient
cause
for
the
initial
detention.
it
was
what
happened
later.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
they
certainly
had
reason
to
believe
he
was
using
an
alias
at
the
time
of
the
detention,
as
you
just
explored
with
justice
scalla.
