mr.
robert
p.
goldberg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
my
first
address...
the
issue
of
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
the
solicitor
general
has
suggested
that
ninth
circuit
did
not
use
the
gates
test
or
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
in
looking
at
the
whole
picture.
in
fact,
in
looking
at
the
ninth
circuit
opinion,
it
did
state
specifically
just
as
officer
kempshall
did
at
the
honolulu
international
airport,
he
considered
the
total
picture.
he
considered
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
in
coming
to
that...
in
looking
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
he
looked
at
each
element.
and
in
looking
at
each
element,
gave
it
whatever
weight
or
value
he
thought
was
appropriate,
just
like
what
the
ninth
circuit
did.
the
ninth
circuit
went
one
more
step
further
in
looking
at
these
elements
is
that
they
looked
at
elements
that
were...
that
covered
almost
any
innocent
traveler
and
then
they
looked
at
those
few
elements
that
possibly
showed
criminal
activity
being
afoot.
and
they
found
that
in
the
cases...
in
prior
cases
before
this
court
such
criminal
activity
was
use
of
an
alias
or
possibly
walking
through
an
airport
in
such
a
manner
as
to
try
to
hide
their
identity.
mr.
robert
p.
goldberg
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
p.
goldberg
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
feel
that
ninth...
how
can
we
not
look
at
the
total
picture
without
looking
at
each
of
the
elements
that
make
this
picture
be
put
together?
i
find...
and
let
me
go
one
step
in,
in
just
responding
to
the
questions
put
to
solicitor
general.
not
everyone
in
this
country
are
lucky
enough
to
be
able
to
have
a
credit
card,
and
other
of
us
maybe
are
afraid
to
have
a
credit
card
because
maybe
we
don't
know
how
to
control
ourselves.
there's
no
gambling
in
honolulu,
in
hawaii.
my
mother
lives
in
florida.
on
the
flight
over
i
was
with
another
attorney
whose
mother
was
in
florida
and
he
was
going
to
visit
her.
they
have
racetracks
in
florida.
if
you
don't
have
a
credit
card,
and
if
i
was
flying
to...
whenever
i
fly
to
florida
to
visit
my
family,
you
know
how...
it
would
be
difficult
to
cash
a
check.
i
do
take
a
lot
of
cash.
and
hundred
dollar
bills
are
often
difficult
to
spend.
most
places
do
not
take
them.
you
have
to
go
into
a
bank
and
get
change
for
them.
in
the
hindsight,
which
is
exactly
what
the
government
used
in
looking
at
these
factors,
we
can
come
up
with
numerous
purposes
and
reasons
why
an
individual
may
carry
a
relatively
small
amount
of
cash,
$4,000,
when
you
consider
the
tickets
were
$2,100,
especially
if
they
intend
to
gamble,
and
people
in
hawaii
do
enjoy
gambling.
mr.
robert
p.
goldberg
i...
i
do
not
disagree
with
your
honor.
i
would
only
suggest
that
i
think
in
the
royer
matter
the
factors
were
almost
exactly
similar
to
the
sokolow
case
except
for
a
few...
except
it
was
even
more
damaging
to
royer
than
it
was
to
sokolow.
and
in
that
case,
i
believe,
justice
rehnquist
and
yourself
indicated
that
without
knowing
that
there
was
an
alias,
that
the
reasonable
suspicion
would
not
have
been...
that
it
would
not
have
reached
a
basis
of
reasonable
suspicion
in
order
to
justify
a
seizure.
in,
in
this
case
we
have...
i
believe
the
government
itself
is
saying
that
we're
looking
at
the
$2,100...
$4,000.
the
alias
in
this
case
is
extremely
interesting.
rents
in
hawaii
are
expensive.
agent
mccarthy
testified
below
at
the
district
court
level
that
it's
not
unusual
for
individuals
to
share
apartments.
it's
almost
a
necessity.
he
also
testified
when
that
occurred
the
telephone
number
was
always
in
one
of
the
two
roommates'
name.
mr.
sokolow,
if
he's
trying
to
hide
his
identity
or
trying
to
hide
hisself
by...
in
any
manner,
why
does
he
give
his
correct
telephone
number?
he
gives
his
correct
telephone
number,
which
immediately
the
agents
know
exactly
where
mr.
sokolow
lives.
they
call
up
that
telephone
number
and
his
voice
is
on
the
answering
machine.
they
know
where
he
lives,
they
know
his
telephone
number,
they
know
where
he's
going,
they
know
when
he's
returning.
there
is
no
evidence
indicative
of
an...
of
an
attempt
to
use
an
alias
here.
they
did
not
know
there
was
an
alias
until
they
grabbed
him
by
the
arm
outside
and
pulled
him
up
onto
the
sidewalk
and
sat
him
down
and
grabbed
his
girlfriend
and
told
them
they
were
going
to
take
his
bags
in
the
back
and
search
them.
there
was
no
notice
of
an
alias
to
that
time.
mr.
robert
p.
goldberg
it
was
in
the
name
of
mr.
herman,
karl
herman.
mr.
robert
p.
goldberg
when
they
called
the
telephone
number,
they
recognized
the
voice--
mr.
robert
p.
goldberg
--of
the
traveler.
mr.
robert
p.
goldberg
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
p.
goldberg
i
would...
knowing
hawaii
and
honolulu,
i
would
suggest
no.
i
would
suggest
that
it
was
indicative
that
there
was
possible
a
roommate
or
that
possibly...
one
of
the
possibilities
of
the
number
of
possibilities
is
he
was
using
an
alias.
mr.
robert
p.
goldberg
i
understand
that,
but
i
would
suggest
that
in
this
case,
as
agent
mccarthy
testified,
it's
not
unusual
for
a
telephone
to
be
in
one
of
a
number
of
roommates'
names.
further,
i
believe
what
the
government,
the
dea
or
the...
attempt
to
use
these
elements
for
is
as
an
investigative
tool,
why
can't
they
investigate?
why
wouldn't
they
go
up
to
mr....
mr.
sokolow
while
he
was
in
los
angeles
or
while
he
was
walking
down
the
corridor?
excuse
me,
sir,
may
i
ask
you
a
few
questions?
why
couldn't
they
determine
whether
this
was
a
one-bedroom
or
two
bedroom
residence?
they
didn't
do
any
investigation
whatsoever.
mr.
robert
p.
goldberg
well--
mr.
robert
p.
goldberg
--i,
i
believe
if
they...
what
remained
of
the
$4,000
was
approximately
$1,900,
which
is
not
a
very
large
amount
of
money
to
buy
narcotics.
and
if
that
was
the
circumstances,
it
would
be
more
than
likely
that
hawaii,
being
a
source
city
for
marijuana,
that
he
was
carrying
marijuana
to
florida.
but
they
didn't
stop
him
or
arrest
him
at
the
airport
in
miami.
mr.
robert
p.
goldberg
in,
in
hindsight,
it
is
possible
to
come
up
with...
to
verify
the
hunch
or
suspicion
or
whatever
it
was
that
made
this...
made
these
individuals
choose
to
stop
mr.
sokolow.
i
believe
one
of
the
serious
problems
in
this
type
of
investigative
tool
is
every
one
of
us
have
inert
prejudices.
maybe
someone
reminds
you
of
your
ex-wife.
maybe
somebody
reminds
you
of
some
kid
that
you
had
problems
with
once.
and
something
happens.
you
go...
something
makes
you
draw
their
attention
and
you
start
looking
around.
you
go
well,
he
is
young,
well
he
is
about
this
age.
his
hair
is
kind
of
long.
well,
he
is
paying
cash
for
his
ticket.
he
only
has
carry-on
baggage,
which
is
indicative
of
a
short
trip
anyway.
but
the
result
of
that
is
we
are
no
longer...
it's
not
just
that
we're
not
free
to
walk
around
anymore
without
being
stopped.
it's
now
when
i
go
into
an
airport...
and
my
hair
is
short
now...
when
i
went
to
san
francisco,
i
paid
cash
for
my
ticket
because
i
did
not
have
a
credit
card,
and
i
was
afraid
maybe
there
would
be
problems
with
my
check
and
my
hair
was
kind
of
long,
i
wore
blue
jeans
and
i
carried
a
carry-on
with
my
suit
on
it
for
the
ninth
circuit
case.
and
mccarthy
and
kempshall
testified
that
san
francisco
is
a
source
city.
and
when
i
was
at
the
airport
i
got
nervous
and
i
got
nervous
because
i
was
afraid
that
i
was
hitting
the
profile
and
i
was
afraid
that
a
dea
agent
was
going
to
approach
me
and
give
me
a
hard
time.
i
don't
want
to
have
to
walk
around
with
that
fear.
i
want
to
be
able
to
walk
around
feeling
i
can
be
free
from
being
messed
with
unless
there's
a
really
good
reason
for
it.
mr.
robert
p.
goldberg
i
think
the
fear
or
the
paranoia
that
goes
around...
i
don't
think
we
have
to...
i
don't
think
we
should
have
to
walk
around
thinking
of
the
government
intruding
on
our
lives.
mr.
robert
p.
goldberg
i
believe
if...
if
your
honor,
i'm
sure
if
your
honor
was
stopped
in
an
airport
that
it
would
upset
you.
i
would
assume
that.
and
the
other
question
that's
never
really
been
asked
is
for
giving
up
all
these
freedoms
and
rights,
how
much...
and
again
for
over
ten
years
they've
been
using
the
so-called
profile
and
they
still
don't
have
any
percentages
on
right
and
wrong...
how
much
have
they
actually,
for
us
giving
up
these
rights
to
walk
around
free...
what
have
they
actually
taken
off
the
streets
in
relationship
to
the
tons
of
junk
that's
come
into
this
country?
how
much
can
you
carry
on
your
person
in
relationship
to
how
much
stuff
is
all
over
the
place?
i'd
like
to
know
that,
too.
i
want
to
know
what
price
i'm
paying
for
giving
up
those
rights.
miami's
a
source
city,
san
francisco,
los
angeles,
san...
san
diego,
washington,
we're
all
source
cities.
i
don't...
i
want
to
be
able
to
walk
around
without
worrying
about
the
government
intruding
on
my
life,
especially
if
somebody's
just
prejudiced
against
somebody
who's
young
or
who
has
long
hair
or
maybe
it's
the
wrong
color
or
there's
maybe
an
attractive
female
looks
something
like
a
female
that
turned
you
down
for
a
dance
the
other
night,
who
knows?
what
evidence
was
there
of
actual
criminal
activity?
mr.
robert
p.
goldberg
yes,
i
did,
your
honor.
when
i
tried
the
case
i
did--
mr.
robert
p.
goldberg
--your
honor,
we
made
a
conditional
plea
at
the
end
of
the
suppression
motion.
mr.
robert
p.
goldberg
yes,
i
did,
your
honor.
we
also
argued
that
again,
the
facts
in
this
case
were
so
similar
to
royer,
and
i
believe...
i
believe
justice
blackmun
stated
that
in
royer
that...
if
in
royer
there
was
not
consent,
then
it
would
be
much
closer
to
donna...
u.s.
versus
donna,
is
that
donna...
if
there
is
no
consent,
i
believe
as
justice
blackmun
stated--
mr.
robert
p.
goldberg
--it's
here
only
in
the
case--
mr.
robert
p.
goldberg
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
similar
to,
i
believe,
the
royer
case
where...
i
think
it
was
royer...
where
they
did...
where
this
court
chose
to
determine
that
when
he
was
held
in
a
small
room...
in
this
case
sokolow
was
also
taken
to
a
small
room.
if
you
hear
the
uncontroverted
testimony
in
the
transcript--
mr.
robert
p.
goldberg
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
p.
goldberg
virtually
identical,
but
even--
mr.
robert
p.
goldberg
--i
believe
the
ninth
circuit
did
reach
the
same
result
because
in
the...
you
see,
in
this
case
you
had
an
absolute,
definite
seizure
at
curbside.
mr.
robert
p.
goldberg
the
court
was
divided,
your
honor,
on
that.
i
believe
the...
i'm
sorry...
my
understanding
of
royer
was
that
royer
was
determined...
royer
was
finally
determined
on
the
small
room
where,
in
fact,
it
was
an
arrest,
even
though
it
was
not--
mr.
robert
p.
goldberg
--that
is
correct.
but
in
that
case
as
your
honor
stated
that...
the
indication
was
that
if
there
was
not
the
use
of
the
alias...
and
in
this
case
they
did
not
know
there
was
an
alias
until
after
the
seizure...
unless
you--
mr.
robert
p.
goldberg
--when
he
con...
when
they
called
and
heard
his
name
on
the
telephone
machine.
again,
i
would...
as
justice
scalla
stated,
it
would
be
a
really
stupid
drug
courier
who
gave
out
his
telephone
number
and
his
address
but
then
hid
his
name
at
the
same
time.
mr.
robert
p.
goldberg
i
believe
that's
what
in
my
viewing
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion,
they
did
state
that
things
such
as
going
to
a
source
city,
which
in
this
case
was
dated
san
francisco,
los
angeles,
san
diego,
miami,
et
cetera,
was
something
that
a
large
group
of
innocent
travelers
do
on
a
daily
basis.
and
that
was
placed
in
one
grouping.
they
placed
a
second
grouping
on
facts
that
are...
normally
indicate
criminal
activity
is
afoot,
and
that
is
use
of
an
alias.
why
would...
although
there's...
in
my
brief
i
state
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
why
someone
would
use
an
alias
for
travel,
anywhere
from
business
to
illicit
affairs,
none
of
which
is,
i
believe,
unconstitutional.
the
use
of
an
alias
is
something
you
look
at.
why
is
this
individual
looking?
why
is
this
person
using
a
different
name.
you
don't
think
why
is
this
person
going
to
chicago
or
cleveland
or
honolulu
or
miami.
miami
happens
to
be
a
source
city.
miami
also
is
a
retirement
city.
it's
also
a
vacation
city.
it
may
be
a
city
where
people
choose
to
invest.
any
number
of
reasons.
just
because
you
go
to
miami
doesn't
indicate
any
criminal
activity.
the
ninth
circuit
just
considered
that
in
coming
and
looking
at
the
whole
picture...
at
the
totality.
they
just
considered
that.
and
after
considering
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
they
felt
there
was
no
reasonable
suspicion.
mr.
robert
p.
goldberg
this
is...
regarding
to
judge--
mr.
robert
p.
goldberg
--i
believe--
mr.
robert
p.
goldberg
--if
i...
if
i
had
to
state
yes,
it
was
the
initial
opinion,
judge
norris
was
so
upset
at
the
fact
that...
and
it
was
clear
to
him
that
the
reason
mr.
sokolow
drew
attention
was
because
he
chose
to
dress
in
a
certain
manner.
and
that
upset
him
so
much
that
people
were
no
longer
free
to
dress
as
they
wished
in
black
with
gold,
blue
jeans,
whatever,
that
that's
where
the
initial
opinion
was
written.
i
think
after
the...
after
we...
both
sides
had
filed
additional
briefs,
they
reconsidered
the
case
based
on
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
and
in
looking
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
they
determined
that...
and
even
this
case
the
government
says
quite...
in
their
brief
they
say
the
way
a
person
is
dressed
and
his
age...
of
course,
being
under
35
is
half
our
population...
is
not
really
something
to
be
considered
very
strongly.
considered,
yes,
but
not
very
strongly.
all
of
which
is
indicative
of
innocent
behavior.
mr.
robert
p.
goldberg
possibly.
justice
kennedy,
i
believe,
was
sitting
at
the
time
the
ninth
circuit
made
their
decision.
again,
i
would
suggest
that
the
purpose
of
these
types
of
stops
are
to...
are
to
use
this
as
an
investigative
tool.
and
i
would
suggest
in
this
case
there
was
no
investigation.
and
i
believe,
according
to
the
dea's
own
profile,
what
they...
according
to
their
own
training,
what
they're
supposed
to
do
is
not
even
stand
in
front
of
an
individual
to
ask
them
some
questions.
walk
to
the
side,
may
i
ask
you
a
few
questions,
not
grab
you
by
the
arm,
pull
you
on
the
curb,
drag
you
in
a
room,
a
little
room,
search
you,
have
a
dog
sniff
one
of
four
bags,
three
of
which
the
dog
said
had
nothing
in
them.
nothing
turns
out
in
the
bag
the
dog
does
alert
to,
and
then
hold
the
guy
13
more
hours
until
they
can
get
another
dog
to
sniff
the
three
other
bags.
mr.
robert
p.
goldberg
yes,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
brandeis
stated
in
olmstead
that
the
very
basis
of
being
an
american
is
the
right
to
be
left
alone,
to
be
free
to
go
wherever
we
want
to
go
without
worrying
about
intrusions,
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
government...
we
have
after
ten
years
of
these
types
of
situations...
and,
and
professor
cloud
in
his
boston
law
review
article
states
real
clearly
that
after
ten
years,
there's
no
indication
that
all
these
officers
work
on
is
some
inert
prejudice
because
every
officer's
program
is
different
than
the
other
officers'.
some
stop
women.
some
stop
hispanics.
some
stop
blacks.
some
stop
long-haired
kids.
some
stop,
et
cetera.
and
what
do
we
know
we're
getting
for
this?
we
don't
know
how
much
is
taken
off
the
market.
we
don't
know
how
successful
they
are.
if
they
were
extremely
successful,
i
would
assume
we'd
have
some
really
good
statistics
showing
us
how
accurate
the
dea
is.
judge
king
in
his
decision
in
this
case
on
the
district
court
level
said
we
hear
about
all
their
successes,
but
we
never
hear
about
their
failures.
after
ten
years
we
still
don't
have
no
statistics.
i
would
only
beg
the
court
to
consider
that
i
feel...
that
we
are
giving
up
a
very
basic,
basic
right
for
returns
we
have
no
knowledge.
if
there
are
no
additional
questions.
