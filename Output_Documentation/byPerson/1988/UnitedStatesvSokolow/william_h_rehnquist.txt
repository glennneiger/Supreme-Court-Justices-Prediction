chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
87-1295,
united
states
against
andrew
sokolow.
mr.
larkin,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
also
go
in
january
and
not
july.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
gates
suggests
quite
the
opposite,
doesn't
it,
that
the
court
does
not
favor
hairsplitting
when
you're
talking
about
reasonableness
of
fourth
amendment,
that
you
don't
divide
it
into
a
whole
bunch
of
legal
categories.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
larkin.
mr.
goldberg,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
that
could
conceivably
be
innocent.
you
know,
maybe
you're
trying
to
avoid
your
wife.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
it
really
isn't
any
big
difference
in
kind
between
the
ninth
circuit's
two
factors.
there
really
is
just
differences
in
degree,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
think
that
question
is
before
the
court,
mr.
goldberg.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
larkin,
you
have
seven
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
larkin.
the
case
is
submitted.
