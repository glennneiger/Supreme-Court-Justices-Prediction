justice

kennedy
are
we
going
to
hear
the
argument
that
even
if
the
curbside
stop
was
legitimate,
the
subsequent
detention
and
removal
of
the
petitioner
to
the
customs
area
was
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
case
is
here
before
us
just
on
the
curbside
stop,
is
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
we,
we,
we
really
don't
get
to
the
subsequent
questioning
and,
and,
and
search
of
the
luggage
in
the
customs
area.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
later.
all
we're
doing
is
talking
about
the
curbside,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
right.
and
as
justice
o'connor
indicates,
we
stated
quite
clearly
that
cash,
travelling
under
an
assumed
name,
etcetera,
was
grounds
for
the
initial
stop
and
interrogation.
the
plurality
opinion
so
indicated.
and
that's
all
we're
dealing
with
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but,
you
see,
the
ninth
circuit
had
two
categories,
criminal
characteristics
that
are
apparently
general
characteristics,
and
indications
of
ongoing
criminal
activity.
but
our
cases
don't
support
that,
and
it
was
very
difficult
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
use
that.
they
gave
as
an
example
a
criminal
trait,
buying...
going
to
a
source
city,
as
opposed
to
conduct,
and
so
you
can
argue
about
that.
and
it...
and
it
seems
to
me
that
doing
to
a
source
city
is
conduct,
considered
together
with
all
of
the
other
factors
in
the
case.
