justice
john
paul
stevens
i
didn't
understand
that.
i,
i
thought
it
was
an
open
ticket
coming
back?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
when
they
stopped
him
in
los
angeles
you
mean?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
did
they
know...
how
did
the
police
in
los
angeles
know
this
man
was
coming
back
on
this
flight?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
record
doesn't--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
i
suppose...
how
did
they
know...
when
did
they
find
out
that
he
was
going
to
make
the
return
flight...
that
he
booked
the
flight
on
the
24th
and
came
back
on
the
25th?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
at
that
time
with
an
open
ticket.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
how
did
they
learn
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
trace.
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
you
another
question?
do
you
have
to
be
a
trained
and
experienced
law
enforcement
officer
to
draw
those
inferences?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question.
don't
you
need
a
inference...
fourth
factor
in
order
to
make
your,
your
trio
hold
up,
and
that
is
the
absence
of
any
apparent
justification?
for
example,
if
on
super
bowl
weekend
someone
flew
from
honolulu
to
miami
and
back,
and
they,
they
had
a
pretty
obvious
explanation
for
a
three-day
trip,
i
suppose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
don't
you
need
that,
at
least,
also?
justice
john
paul
stevens
might
he
not
argue
a
motion
in
an
important
case,
or
something
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
said
you
needed...
you
wouldn't
say
every
cash
purchase
is
enough?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
had
the
three
things:
you
had
the
cash
purchase,
the
short
period
of
time
for
a
long
trip,
and
miami.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
larkin,
the
thing
that
bothers
me
about
your
relying
on
the
expertise
of
the
officer,
doesn't
he
have
to
have
reasonable...
even
the
expert
officer
has
to
have
reasons
he
can
articulate
and
that
you
can
review.
it
would
not
be
enough
to
say
i've
been
in
this
business
50
years,
and
i
think
i
can
spot...
i
can
smell
a
drug
courier?
that
wouldn't
be
enough,
would
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
doesn't
he
have
to
have
reasons
that
he
can
state
and
a
judge
can
listen
to
and
decide
whether
they
constitute
reasonable
suspicion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
those
facts
aren't
enough,
would
the
fact
that
he'd
been
in
the
business
for
50
years
make
a
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
i
really
don't
see
how
you
can
rely
on
this
expertise
argument
at
all.
he's
an
expert
in
spotting
things.
he
can
tell
us
what
they
are.
but
if
what
he
tells
us
doesn't
persuade
us,
the
fact
that
he's
an
expert,
i
don't
see
adds,
adds
anything
to
your
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
the
court
later
has
a
duty
to
decide
whether
that
judgment
based
on
those
facts
amounts
to
reasonable
suspicion.
i
don't
think
it
becomes
more
reasonable
because
he's
been
in
the
business
50
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
seems
to
me
if
they're
reasonable,
they're
reasonable
if
he's
a
brand
new
officer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
has
to
be
able
to
explain
it,
doesn't
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
can't
just
say
i,
i
can...
i
can
smell
drug
couriers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
a
man
who's
been
in
the
business
for
30
years
can't
get
away
with
pure
hunches.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
just
one
that
your
opponent
prompted.
he
mentioned
that
san
francisco,
san
diego,
los
angeles,
honolulu
are
all
source
cities.
do
we
know
how
many
source
cities
there
are
that
could
be
substituted
for
miami
and
produce
the
same
result?
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
example,
i
suppose
you'd
say
the
same
thing
about
tampa,
fort
lauderdale,
key
west
and
all
of
those?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
they're
also
source
cities?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
does
that
include
san
diego,
perhaps
houston,
then,
if
they're
coming
in
from
mexico,
too.
most
any
city
or
the
border
of
the
country
could
qualify.
