justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
sure
that
that
alone
wouldn't
be
enough?
i
mean,
that's
rather
extraordinarily,
isn't
it,
just
handing
over
to
somebody
a
$4,000
roll
of
$20
bills?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
wouldn't
even
put
it
the
cash
purchase
alone.
i,
i
suppose
if
for
some
reason
if
he
had
two
$1,000
bills
and
a
$100
bill,
it
wouldn't
trouble
me
so
much.
it's
just
a
$4,000
roll
of
20s.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
we're
getting
stupid
drug
couriers
off
the
street.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
i
thought
they...
they
had
the
phone
number
and
they
checked
with
the
telephone
company
whose
name
that
phone
number
was
listed
under.
justice
antonin
scalia
didn't
it
appear
to
them
at
that
time
that
he
was
using
an
alias?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
voice
is
coming
from
a
phone
number
that
is
listed
in
the
name...
in
a
name
different
from
the
name
that
he
gave
to
the
travel
agent.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
they
may
have
been
wrong
about
whether
he
was
using
an
alias,
but
it
certainly
seemed
that
he
was
using
an
alias,
wouldn't
you
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
sure,
there
are
a
lot
of
possibilities
and
for
all
of
these
things.
you
can
see
a
man
walking
into
a
bank
with
a
gun
in
his
hand,
and
he
could...
he
could
have
a
friend
in
there
who's
a
gunsmith
to
clean
it,
but
it's
not
likely.
and
you
put
all
of
them
together,
and
that's
what
builds
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
if...
if
they
had
done
that,
they
would
have
only
gotten
the
rest
of
the
$4,000
that
he
had
in
his
pocket
which
it's
not
illegal
to
carry.
they
were
obviously
going
to
follow
him
and
wait
until
he
came
back
from
miami
with...
you
know,
with
what
he
came
back
with.
i
think
that
was
pretty
smart,
don't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
should...
why
should
they
arrest
him
before
he's
committed
the
crime
that
they
suspect
him
of,
of,
of
engaging
in?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
wasn't
necessarily
buying
it.
he
was
just
carrying
it
for
somebody
else
who
already
owned
it
at
both
points.
justice
antonin
scalia
fear
of
what?
in
fear
that,
that
a
policeman
will
come
up
and
ask
if
a
dog
can
sniff
your,
your
trunk?
i
mean,
isn't
this
all
a
matter
of
how
much
of
a
constraint
upon
all
of
our
liberties
we're
willing
to
put
up
with
in,
in
order
to
enable
crime
to
be
stopped.
and
you,
you
think
that
is
an
excessive
price
to
pay?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
mind
a
dog
smelling
my
luggage
at,
at
all
if
i'm
not
carrying
drugs
in
it.
it
really
doesn't...
it
doesn't
fill
me
with
paranoia
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
peoria,
surely.
