mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
stems
from
the
detention
of
respondent
outside
the
honolulu
airport
on
the
ground
that
he
was
suspected
of
narcotics
trafficking.
the
question
presented
by
this
case
involves
the
type
of
evidence
on
which
a
law
enforcement
officer
may
rely
in
making
that
type
of
judgment.
it's
our
submission
that
the
reasonable
suspicion
inquiry
in
this
context
should
be
answered
in
the
same
way
that
that
question
is
answered
in
any
other
context,
by
looking
to
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
viewing
the
facts
in
a
common
sense
manner,
and
giving
weight
to
the
reasonable
inferences
that
a
trained
and
experienced
law
enforcement
officer
can
draw.
respondent
was
detained
just
as
he
was
about
to
board
a
cab
outside
the
honolulu
airport.
at
that
time
the
agents
knew
the
following:
they
knew
that
respondent
had
purchased
two
round
trip
open
return
tickets
from
honolulu
to
miami
for
$2,100
by
handing
the
airline
ticket
agent
a
$4,000
roll
of
$20
bills.
the
agents
knew
that
respondent
had
just
spent
20
hours
flying
12,000
miles
to
spend
only
two
days
at
his
destination,
which
happens
to
be
the
nation's
principal
source
city
for
cocaine.
the
agents
had
reason--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--yes.
at
the
time
they
stopped
him,
they
knew
he
had
only
spent
two
days
in
miami.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
they
stopped
him
in
los
angeles
on
the
same
day
that
they
stopped
him
in
honolulu.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
it's
not
clear
from
the
record
who
first
told
them.
it's
clear
that
they
told
the
people
in
honolulu
that
respondent
was
seen
in
the
waiting
area
waiting
for
a
connecting
flight
from
l.a.
to
honolulu,
but
it's
not
clear
who
exactly--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--told
them
that
respondent
may
have
been
coming
back
on
that
day.
they
knew;
that
is,
the
agents
in
honolulu
knew
on
july
24th
that
respondent
had
booked
a
flight
to
return
on
july
25th,
the
following
day.
it's
possible,
then,
that
the
agents
in
honolulu
may
have
told
the
agents
in
l.a.
to
be
on
the
lookout.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
let
me
explain
it
this
way.
he
left
on
the
22nd
of
july.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
open
ticket.
on
the
24th,
they
learned
that
he
had
booked
a
return
for
the
following
day,
the
25th.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that's
not
clear
from
the
record.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
at
the
time
the
respondent
was
stopped,
the
agents
also
had
reason
to
suspect
that
he
was
traveling
under
an
alias
because
there
was
a
discrepancy
between
the
name
that
he
gave
to
the
airline
and
the
name
listed
for
the
telephone
number
at
which
respondent's
voice
was
on
an
answering
machine.
the
agents
also
knew
the
respondent
appeared
nervous
when
he
first
purchased
his
tickets
in
honolulu,
and
that
he
appeared
nervous
and
was
looking
all
around
the
waiting
area
in
the
l.a.
airport
awaiting
a
connecting
flight
back.
the
agents
also
knew
the
respondent
had
purchased
his
tickets
shortly
before
his
departure
from
honolulu
and
that
he
and
his
companion
had
checked
none
of
their
four
bags
for
either
leg
of
their
journey.
from
all
of
those
facts,
a
trained
and
experienced
law
enforcement
officer
could
draw
the
following
four
inferences.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
i
think
it
certainly
helps
because
it
cuts
down
on
the
time
necessary
for
someone
to
go
through
the
process.
we,
for
example,
in
our
brief
have
explained
in
detail
why
each
of
these
factors
is
relevant.
a
law
enforcement
officer
with
the
type
of
experience
that
these
people
had
doesn't
need
to
write
that
out
or
go
through
the
detail
that
we
did.
you
can
easily,
if
you
have
the
experience
that
these
people
have,
make
that
judgment.
now,
if
you
were
a
new
law
enforcement
officer
and
had
been
trained
by
other
people
who
are
experienced
to
look
for
these
certain
factors,
then
a
new
law
enforcement
officer
making
a
common
sense
judgment
in
a
case
like
this
where
the
evidence
is
this
strong,
i
think,
could
easily
reach
the
same
conclusion.
so,
the
difference
is
really,
i
guess,
just
a
matter
of
time.
it's
intuitive
for
someone
with
the
type
of
experience
that
these
law
enforcement
officers
had.
but
for
someone
who
may
be
new,
i
think
he
would
certainly
come
to
the
same
conclusion,
but
he
may
just
have
to
think
about
it
a
little.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
only
three.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
the
cash
purchase
of
airline
tickets,
the
12,000
mile
trip
and
the
20
hours
in
the
air
for
only
a
two
day
stay
at
the
destination,
and
the
fact
that
the
destination
was
miami.
in
our
view,
those
three
facts
alone
amount
to
reasonable
suspicion
because
they
make
it
unlikely
that
someone
traveled
for
a
business
reason.
they
make
it
unlikely
that
someone
traveled
for
a
vacation.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
he
was,
but
let
me
say
legitimate
business
reason,
then.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
no.
it
is
a
factor
among
others.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well...
it
depends.
it's
a
factor
that
has
to
be
looked
at
in
context.
there
are
numerous
air
travelers
who
are
nervous,
and
we're
not
arguing
that
nervousness
by
itself
in
an
airport
is
indicative
of
criminal
conduct.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that's,
that's
another
way
of
describing
intuition,
and
intuition
is
something
that
is
built
on
experience
and
training.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
it's
part
of
the
type
of
judgment
that
this
court
in
terry
said,
a
reasonable
officer
is
entitled
to
take
into
account.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
here
you
have
a
different
type
of
facts
because
you
have
a
different
type
of
crime.
smuggling
is
a
crime
of
stealth.
it's
not
like
a
bank
robbery
or
a
package
store
robbery.
all
that's
necessary
to
complete
the
crime
of
smuggling
is
concealment
and
escape.
someone
who
is
experienced,
therefore,
has
to
be
able
to
draw
on
a
variety
of
different
subtle
clues.
that's
the
type
of
clues
that
this...
these
officers
drew
on,
and
they
drew,
as
i
started
to
say,
the
following
four
inferences.
first,
respondent
did
not--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--yes,
if,
if
there
was--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--yes.
there,
there,
there
was
in
this
case
no
sort
of
obvious,
apparent
explanation.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
the
cash
purchase
of
airline
tickets
might,
i
think,
be
a
reasonable
explanation
for
why
there
was
no
business
trip.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
no.
no,
no.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
for
example,
a
lot
of
people
use
cash
to
purchase
a
ticket
on
a
shuttle
going
from
new
york
to
washington,
so
we're
not
saying
that
the
simple
fact
that
someone
has
paid
for
a
ticket
in
cash
is
necessarily
indicative
of
criminal
conduct.
but
this
was
a
$2,100
purchase
out
of
a
$4,000
roll
of
$20
bills.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
it
is
rather
extraordinary,
and
one
of
the
striking
features
about
this
case
is
that's
the
sort
of
conclusion
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
its
first
opinion.
in
its
first
opinion
in
this
case,
it
said
that
the
cash
purchase
of
airline
tickets
by
itself
was
cause
for
reasonable
suspicion.
one
of
the
most
striking
features
of
the
two
opinions
the
court
of
appeals
issued
in
this
case,
was
by
the
time
the
court
got
to
its
second
opinion,
that
fact
had
dropped
out
entirely;
and
the
court
gave
it
no
weight
at
all.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
i
can't
disagree
with
you
on
that,
your
honor.
[laughter]
the
four
inferences
that
are
reasonable
to
draw
in
this
case
are:
the
respondent
didn't
travel
on
business
for
precisely
the
reason
you
gave.
business
travelers
normally
use
a
credit
card
or
a
travel
agency
to
make
their
trips.
they
don't
normally
pay
with
a
$4,000
roll
of
$20
bills.
the
second
inference
that
is
unlikely,
respondent
went
for
a
vacation.
few
people
who
live
in
honolulu
are
going
to
take
a
summer
vacation
in
miami,
but
fewer
still
are
going
to
travel
12,000
miles
and
20
hours
just
to
spend
two
days
there.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
i'm
not
going
to
address
that...
the
arguments...
the
issues
that
arose
after
the
initial
detention
because
we
did
not
present
those
to
this
court
in
our
certiorari
petition.
the
dissent
below,
judge
wiggins
addressed
those
issues,
but
the
majority
did
not.
if
this
court
were
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
those
sorts
of
issues
would
be
open
for
reconsideration
on
remand.
but
we
do
believe--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--correct.
if
the
detention
was
valid
under
terry,
then
the
remaining
issues
would
have
to
be
addressed
below,
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
court
of
appeals
majority
opinion
that
addresses
them.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
correct.
the
third
inference
that
an
officer
could
draw
is
that
respondent
didn't
travel
for
another
innocent
personal
reason,
like
going
to
the
super
bowl.
most
people
who
go
to
the
super
bowl
or
to
a
wedding
or
a
funeral
are
not
likely
to
use
an
alias,
and
the
agents
had
reasonable
reason
to
suspect
the
respondent
was
doing
so.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that's
right.
the
only
reasonable
inference,
the
fourth
one
i'd
like
to
mention,
is
that
respondent
was
smuggling
cocaine
back
into
hawaii.
that,
in
fact,
is
the
only
inference
that
accounts
for
all
of
the
facts
that
were
known
to
the
officers
in
this
case.
now,
respondent
has
argued
that
that
inference
is
unreasonable
basically
for
two
reasons.
one
is
that
it
could
have
been
wrong
and
another
is
that
each
of
the
facts
on
which
the
agents
relied
could
have
an
innocent
explanation.
both
of
those
arguments,
in
our
view,
are
foreclosed
by
well
settled
case
law
in
this
court.
it's
well
settled
in
cases
such
as
cortez
and
gates
that
all
the
facts
must
be
considered.
and
that
is,
in
fact,
what
the
dea
agent,
agent
kempshall,
did
in
this
case,
as
he
testified
at
pages
59
to
61
of
the
suppression
hearing
transcript.
he
considered
all
of
the
facts
because
he
said
there
may
be
an
innocent
explanation
for
each
fact
when
each
fact
on
a
trip
is
considered.
it's
also
settled
law
that
an
agent
need
not
conclusively
prove
that
a
person
is
in
possession
of
narcotics.
terry
only
requires
that
a
rational,
objectively
based
inference
be
used
to
support
an
intention.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
with
us
both
as
to
the
bottom
line
and
as
to
the
reasoning.
according
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
central
flaw
in
our
position
was
that
the
government
had,
and
i'm
quoting,
"unwittingly
equated
evidence
of
behavior
that
a
criminal
may
engage
in
with
behavior
indicating
an
ongoing
crime.
"
to
remedy
that
type
of
error
the
court
of
appeals
created
a
new
reasonable
suspicion
test.
it
consists
of
two
categories.
the
first
category
of
evidence
consists
of
evidence
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
believes
was
an
ongoing
crime,
such
as
the
use
of
an
alias.
the
second
category
which
the
court
of
appeals
termed
probabilistic
evidence
consists
of
conduct
that
a
drug
courier
may
engage
in,
such
as
the
cash
purchase
of
airline
tickets.
the
court
of
appeals
then
set
up
a
mechanism
for
analyzing
the
evidence
once
it's
fit
into
one
of
these
two
categories.
to
establish
reasonable
suspicion,
the
government
must
prove
at
least
one
factor
from
the
first
category.
factors
from
the
second
category
only
serve
to
confirm
or
refute
the
presence
of
reasonable
suspicion
based
on
evidence
from
the
first
category.
but
even
to
serve
that
limited
confirmatory
function,
the
government
must
first
show
that
the
factors
on
which
it
relies
have
statistical
or
empirical
validity
in
that
they
describe
only
someone
who
is
presently
engaged
in
criminal
activity
and
not
someone
who
is
merely
a
criminal
or
who
is
innocent
of
any
crime.
otherwise,
all
the
factors
that
fit
into
category
two,
such
as
the
ones
i
mentioned
before,
are
in
the
court
of
appeals'
terms
irrelevant
to
the
suspicion
analysis.
the
ninth
circuit
applied
that
test
in
this
case
in
a
very
mechanical
way.
it
said
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
respondent
was
using
an
alias.
it
then
went
on
to
say
there
was
no
evidence
that
respondent's
nervousness
was
due
to
fear
of
apprehension
rather
than
fear
of
a
mid-air
collision.
at
that
point
it
stopped
its
analysis
entirely.
it
didn't
consider
any
of
the
remaining
evidence
even
though
in
its
first
opinion
it
said
the
cash
purchase
alone
was
close
to
establishing
reasonable
suspicion.
now,
no
decision
by
this
court
remotely
suggests
that
the
facts
should
be
pigeonholed
into
two
categories
in
this
manner.
the
cortez
case
and
the
gates
case
to
us
seem
to
make
clear
that
all
of
the
facts
must
be
considered.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
precisely.
the
gates
case
made
that
point
in
the
context
of
the
probable
cause
determination,
and
the
same
point
applies
even
more
forcefully
in
the
reasonable
suspicion
context.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
it's
difficult
to
answer
that.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
it
certainly
wasn't
very
smart
for
him
to
go
about
paying
for
the
tickets
that
way.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
to
the
extent
what
you're
concerned
about
is
that
these...
the
facts
that
we
have
here
may
not
be
the
facts
that
occurred
in
the
real
world.
that's
a
question
for
the
district
court
to
handle
because
those
sorts
of
matters
are
questions
of
historical
fact.
the
defendant
has
the
opportunity
to
testify.
he
has
the
opportunity
to
cross-examine
the
officers.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
and
the
district...
and
he
has
the
opportunity
to
persuade
the
district
court
that
the
officers'
story
is
an
after-the-fact
fabrication.
the
defendant
had
that
opportunity
in
this
case,
and
the
district
court
found
against
him.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
the
court
of
appeals
test
is
arbitrary
because
there
is
no
material
difference
between
the
types
of
facts
that
fit
into
category
one
and
category
two.
there's
no
difference
in
a
material
sense
between
a
fact
like
the
use
of
an
alias
and
the
fact
like
a
cash
purchase
of
airline
tickets,
although
the
court
of
appeals
described
the
second
type
of
fact
as
only
a
probabilistic
fact.
all
evidence
is
probabilistic.
the
appropriate
question,
as
the
court
made
clear
in
the
gates
case,
is
not
whether
conduct
is
innocent
or
guilty,
but
is
the
degree
of
suspicion
that
attaches
to
certain
types
of
conduct.
the
court
of
appeals
test
is
erroneous
for
another
reason
as
well.
it
leaves
no
room
for
the
judgment
of
experienced
officers,
and
the
officers
in
this
case
had
considerable
experience.
two
of
them
alone,
officer
mccarthy,
the
honolulu
police
officer
who
was
first
approached
by
the
united
airlines
ticket
agent,
and
the
dea
agent
who
made
the
detention,
agent
kempshall--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--no.
that
would
be
what
the
court--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
he
has
to
be
able
to
point
to
the
facts
that
he
believes
were
suspicious.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
no.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
it's
in
the
last
step
and
whether
what
he
says
is
persuasive.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
he
can...
he
can
explain
and
make
judgments
based
on
his
experience
as
to
why
a
particular
fact
is
significant.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
the
judge
has
the
independent
duty
to
decide
whether
these
facts
are
reasonable
or
not.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
it
can
in
certain,
certain
cases
where
the
facts
are
this
obvious
amount
to
that.
but
where
the
facts
may
be
more
subtle,
where...
where
the
officer
relies
on
a
fact
that
maybe
the
district
court
would
not
on
its
own
have
thought
suspicious,
the
officer
could
explain
that.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
no.
that's
absolutely
right.
that
would
be
the
type
of
unarticulated
hunch
that
is
insufficient
under
terry.
my,
my
point
about
experience
is
that
if--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--absolutely.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
now,
the
only
explanation
for
the
court
of
appeals'
very
mechanical
test
is
that
it
believed
the
dea
agents
were
also
relying
on
a
very
mechanical
test.
the
court
of
appeals
believed
that
the
agents
were
relying
on
a
drug
courier
profile
that
contained
a
variety
of
different
characteristics
that
the
agents
just
mechanically
used
in
selecting
people
at
an
airport.
that's
not
true
in
this
case,
and
it's
not
true
in
general.
in
this
case,
agent
kempshall
testified,
and
his
testimony
is
reprinted
at
page
59
of
the
joint
appendix,
that
he
relied
on
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
and
he
did
so,
as
he
explained
on
pages
60
to
61,
because
individual
factors
may
have
an
innocent
explanation.
dea
agents
in
general
are
taught
to
approach
the
problem
that
way.
they're
not
taught
just
to
engage
in
a
checklist
sort
of
analysis
of
the
facts.
now,
when
they
are
taught
what
to
look
for,
some
of
the
factors
that
they
are
taught
to
look
for
are
factors
that
have
proven
reliable
to
other
agents.
but
that
is
the
same
way
police
officers
operate
in
any
other
type
of
context.
it
would
be
irrational
to
denigrate
an
officer's
judgment
on
the
ground
that
what
he
saw
in
a
particular
case
and
what
he
believed
to
be
suspicious
had
also
been
seen
in
other
cases
and
had
been
found
by
other
agents
equally
suspicious.
in
fact,
what's
ironic
about
the
ninth
circuit's
test
is
that
if
the
ninth
circuit
was
responding
to
what
it
believed
was
a
drug
courier
profile,
then
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
created
its
own
drug
courier
profile
in
an
attempt
to
respond.
the
court
of
appeals
created
two
categories
of
evidence.
it
required
that
all
the
evidence
be
put
into
one
category
or
the
other,
and
then
it
adopted
a
very
mechanical
means
of
analyzing
all
the
facts.
for
all
the
reasons
we
have
given,
that
type
of
approach
is
worse
than
anything
the
court
of
appeals
feared
that
the
agents
engaged
in.
in
fact--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
airports
are
used
to
traffic
in
drugs
because
they're
the
quickest
way
to
travel
from
point
a
to
point
b.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
the
agents
normally
are
taught
to
use
the
factors
to
help
distinguish--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--we
don't...
the
dea
does
not
have
statistics
on
the
general
number
nationwide
of
stops
that
are
engaged
in
for
the
time.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
no.
it
has
been
very
effective.
for
example,
it--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
they
have
some
general
impressionistic
judgments
based,
for
example,
in
the
l.a.
airport,
on
the
amount
of
money
that
they
have
obtained
over
the
past
several
years.
they've
obtained
several
million
dollars
in
cases
like
this
because
the
money
is...
if
it's
associated
with
narcotics
trafficking
is
later
forfeited.
so,
they
don't
have
any
precise
statistics,
and
certainly
not
the
type
of
statistics
the
ninth
circuit
demanded
in
this
case.
but
it
is
the
judgment
of
the
people
at
the
drug
enforcement
administration
it
has
been
a
very
valuable
program
because
it
has
allowed
them
to
intercept
narcotics
trafficking
at
a
point
above
the
more
traditional
undercover
operation,
but
below
that
of
the
massive
type
of
importations
that
can
occur
by
ship.
my
final
point
is
this.
at
the
end
of
the
day,
the
ninth
circuit's
analysis
is
precisely
the
type
of
analysis
that
this
court
rejected
in
the
gates
case.
for
all
the
reasons
we
have
given
in
our
brief
and
the
reasons
i
have
tried
to
summarize
here
today,
that
analysis
adopted
by
the
ninth
circuit
is
not
only
inconsistent
with
this
court's
precedents
and
principles,
it's
inconsistent
with
any
common
sense
approach
to
this
problem.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
i
have
nothing
further
to
add.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
unless
the
members
of
the
court
have
any
further
questions,
i
have
nothing
further.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
it
varies,
your
honor.
miami,
for
example,
is
just
one
of
the
cities
in
this
whole
south
florida
area.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
no,
fort
lauderdale
and
west
palm
beach
are
close
to
miami,
and
the
dea
has
informed
me,
therefore,
that
people
will
fly
into
and
out
of
the
different
airports
there.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
they
would
be
considered
that
simply
because
when
we're
talking
about
miami,
we're
not
saying
that
it's
just
the
geographic
confines
of
the
city.
it's
that
entire
south
florida
area,
miami
having
the
busiest
airport.
when
the
agents
talked
about
the
west
coast,
what
he
said
was
that
narcotics
are
transported
from
miami
to
the
west
coast
for
transshipment
then
to
hawaii,
for
example,
or
for
use
on
the
west
coast
itself.
for
a
long
time
narcotics
in
l.a.
came
from
miami.
i'm
told
that
recently
and
unfortunately
there
is
now
narcotics
coming
in
from
mexico
as
well.
so,
when
you
say
source
city
in
this
context,
it
involves
taking
a
look
at
some
of
the
facts.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
any
city
is
potentially
eligible
because
factors
of
geography
and
tradition
may
make
it
an
attractive
port
for
smugglers.
there
may
be
established
distribution
networks
in
that
city
so
that
once
cocaine
is
brought
in,
it's
easier
then
to
send
it
out
to
the
rest
of
the
country.
but
we're
not
saying
that
we
can
just
pick
at
random
any
city
that
we
happen
to
find
in
rand
mcnally's
and
call
it
a
source
city.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
no.
that
is
not
by
any
means
a
source
city.
miami
has
traditionally
been
a
source
city
because
of
its
access,
easy
access
from
colombia,
for
example,
to
the
southern
florida
region.
