well,
along
the
same
lines,
how
many
of
these
items
do
you
need?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
three?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
use
nervousness
any
more,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
since
these
crashes
every
other
day,
i
don't
think
you
use
nervousness
any
more,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you're
really
arguing
with
gut
reaction,
aren't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
know
what
a
gut
reaction
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
really
what
you're
arguing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can't
find
intuition
anyplace
in
the
constitution,
can
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
right.
terry
was
no
intuition.
terry
was...
the
man
was
standing
there,
locking,
casing
the
joint.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
larkin,
what
worries
me
is
why
a
man
of
just
ordinary
intelligence,
knowing
about
these
profiles,
and
any
courier
certainly
must
know
about
them,
why
they
would
lay
themselves
open
to
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean
the
$2,400...
$4,000
in
$20
bills.
he
should
have
known
about
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
know,
it
reminds
me
of
the
cases
where
the
thugs
always
have
their
tv
set
they've
stolen
sitting
right
in
the
window
so
the
police
can
see
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
try
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn't
you
make
all
of
these
arguments
to
the
jury
that
you
are
now
making?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
that's
right.
yeah.
but
you
made
the
same
arguments
then?
