so,
all
we
have
before
us
is
the
curbside
stop
and
that
if
you
prevail
on
that,
we
then
remand?

mr.
larkin,
i,
i...
we've
had
a
lot
of
these
cases
like
this
around
here.
does
the
government
view
this,
this
airport
stop...
is
it
really
an
important
tool
in
the...
in
trying
to
stop
the
drug
traffic?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
just
wonder
how
often
it...
how
often
it
really...
how
often
using
this
profile
comes
up
with
anything.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
how
often
does
it
bear
fruit?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
suppose
if
they,
if
they...
it
really
was
a...
produced
something
very
rarely,
they
wouldn't
put
all
this
manpower
into
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
do
you
know?
you
say
there
isn't
any
statistics.
