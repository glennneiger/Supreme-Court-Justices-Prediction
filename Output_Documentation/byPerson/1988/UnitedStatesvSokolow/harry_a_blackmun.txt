justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
goldberg,
do
you
know
why
we
had
two
separate
opinions
in
the
ninth
circuit
by
different
justices,
not
concurring
but
successively
different
opinions?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
the
first
one
was
by
judge
norris,
as
i
recall,
and
the
second
one
was
by
judge
ferguson.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
second
prompted
by
the
rehearing
petition
en
banc
which
was
not
granted,
but--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--well,
maybe
justice
kennedy
can
help
me
out.
