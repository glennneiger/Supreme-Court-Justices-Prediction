mr.
paul
march
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
our
position
in
this
case
is
essentially
two-fold.
first,
we
believe
that
the
labor
interim
presumption
regulation
is
clearly
in
conflict
with
the
governing
statute.
under
the
1977
amendments,
it
is
our
position
that
the
secretary
was
required
to
make
available
the
interim
presumption
of
disability
to
all
black
lung
claimants
who
filed
prior
to
a
certain
date.
the
secretary's
rule
however
as
has
been
discussed
flatly
bars
any
claimant
from
invoking
the
interim
presumption
if
he
does
not
have
ten
years
of
mine
employment
in
his
background.
for
this
reason
it
was
fully
appropriate
in
our
view
for
the
fourth
circuit
in
broyles
to
have
granted
relief
to
two
claimants
who
had
individually
pursued
their
claims
through
more
than
a
decade
of
administrative
appeals.
and
the
second,
we
believe
that
the
eighth
circuit
in
sebben
was
also
correct
in
granting
mandamus
relief
to
the
affected
class
of
claimants
who
were
denied
the
interim
presumption
and
did
not
pursue
these
individual
appeals.
our
argument
here
is
primarily
based
on
a
separate
section
of
the
statute
which
specifically
directed
the
secretary
to
review
the
files
of
all
pending
and
denied
claims,
applying
the
revised
statutory
standards,
and
to
grant
immediate
retroactive
benefits
to
any
claimant
who
under
those
revised
standards
would
have
already
demonstrated
entitlement.
these
reviews,
however,
were
conducted
without
applying
the
revised
statutory
standards
where
there
was
less
than
ten
years
of
mine
employment.
mr.
paul
march
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
it
the
reviews
had
been
conducted
under
the
appropriate
standards,
and
at
that
point
the
claimant
had
been
notified
that
there
had
been
a
determination
made
that
they
didn't
qualify,
at
that
point
i
would
certainly
concede
that
their
only
appropriate
relief
would
be
an
appeal.
but
whereas
here
the
reviews
were
meaningless
in
that
they
applied
the
same
standards
that
congress
had
just
thrown
out.
our
contention
is
that
the
will
of
congress
certainly
requires
that
they
be
allowed
the
opportunity
to
enforce
this
right
and
have
a
meaningful
first
level
review
as
congress
mandated.
mr.
paul
march
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
what
you
have
here
is
a
situation
where
they
applied
precisely
the
same
standards
from
1972
which
congress
had
just
identified
as
being
illegal
and
inappropriate.
the
same
standards
which
had
led
to
this
less
than
10
percent
approval
rate
were
being
applied.
the
statute
was
passed
for
the
precise
purpose
of
throwing
cut
those
standards,
but
when
you
had
a
claimant
with
less
than
10
years,
they
didn't
have
any
revised
standards
applied.
indeed,
if
they
had
been
denied
previously,
when
they
were
reviewed,
they
were
reviewed
under
precisely
the
same
standards
that
they
had
previously
applied.
mr.
paul
march
smith
well,
where
it
goes
to
the
fundamental
value
of
the
review
mechanism
created
by
congress.
mr.
paul
march
smith
well,
certainly,
you
can
look
at
the
legislative
history
and
the
intent
of
congress
in
the
section.
or
maybe
i
should
turn
first
to
the
issue
of
the
validity
of
the
regulation
and
try
to
demonstrate
the
centrality
of
what
was
going
on
here.
mr.
paul
march
smith
well,
that's
right,
your
honor.
in
the
sense
that
congress
said
we
want
to
reopen
these
claims.
mr.
paul
march
smith
if
congress
hadn't
said
reopen
it?
mr.
paul
march
smith
well,
we
would
have
a
different
case
here
than
when
you
have
a
specific
provision
that
says
these
people
have
been
abused
in
this
process
for
the
past
five
years.
they've
had
inappropriate
denials.
they've
had
huge
backlogs.
and
we
know
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
if
they
are
forced
to
do
anything,
even
refile
their
claims
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
these
1977
amendments,
they
will
not
do
so
in
mass
numbers.
the
secretary's
action
in
effect
said
we're
going
to
eliminate
this
whole
protective
mechanism.
we're
going
to
review
them
under
the
very
same
standards
which
congress
through
out.
and
then
we're
not
only
going
to
require
them
to
refile,
we're
going
to
require
them
to
go
through
four
levels
of
administrative
review
before
they
get
their
first
opportunity
to
have
this
interim
presumption
applied
to
their
case.
mr.
paul
march
smith
no.
what
happened,
justice
stevens,
is
that
when
the
interim
presumption
was
found
inapplicable
by
virtue
of
the
ten
year
exclusion,
the
claim
was
then
reviewed
under
the
old
1972
labor
part
c
standards.
those
standards
required
proof
of
all
three
elements
of
a
claim.
the
most
important
feature
of
those
standards
was
that
they
required
direct
proof
of
disability
by
the
claimant.
so
when
they
reviewed
them,
and
they
again
found
the
interim
presumption
inapplicable,
they
just
went
ahead
and
applied
the
same
regulations
which
had
been
in
effect
before
the
1977
amendments.
let
me
just
start
with
the--
mr.
paul
march
smith
--the
line
we
draw,
justice
scalia,
is
based
precisely
on
the
statute.
there's
a
separate
section
of
the
statute,
section
923(b)
which
says
in
every
adjudication
make
sure
that
all
relevant
medical
evidence
is
considered.
now,
in
1977
in
the
revised
statute,
they
incorporate
that
provision
into
the
definition
of
total
disability
which
is
what
we're
talking
about
here,
902(f)(2).
and
the
conference
report
specifically
says
apply
the
ssa,
the
hew
criteria
except
be
sure
you
follow
this
other
statutory
requirement
which
is
to
make
sure
that
all
relevant
medical
evidence
is
considered
in
each
adjudication.
there
was
concern
that
ssa
had
not
been
allowing
all
of
the
relevant
medical
evidence
to
come
in
on
rebuttal.
and
they
drew
specific
attention
to
this
other
statutory
requirement
which
they
had
incorporated
into
the
secretary's
duties
in
that
bill
and
said
make
sure
that
you
follow
all
the
ssa
criteria
except
make
sure
that
all
the
relevant
medical
evidence
can
come
into
the
process
at
some
point.
and
then
when
the
secretary
promulgates
the
broader
rebuttal
criteria
under
the
revised
rule,
the
secretary
specifically
based
those
broader
rebuttal
criteria
on
this
other
statutory
section
and
on
the
conference
report's
reference
to
it.
so
what
you
have
here
is
you
have
a
general
requirement,
equivalent
disability
criteria
from
the
ssa
rule
and
the
labor
rule.
a
specific
exception
to
that
general
requirement
pointed
out
by
congress
and
then
pointed
out
by
the
secretary.
that
exception
doesn't
in
any
way
suggest
that
the
general
requirement
is
itself
in
any
way
soft
or
loose.
it
is
a
specific
exception
which
doesn't
support
their
position
here.
certainly,
they
can't
say
that
by
excluding
people
with
less
than
ten
years
they've
facilitated
the
consideration
of
all
relevant
medical
evidence.
so
in
the
end
i
think
the
fact
that
congress
crew
a
specific
exception
supports
our
position.
it
doesn't
support
theirs.
it
shows
that
congress
knew
how
to
make
an
exception
to
the
requirement.
mr.
paul
march
smith
if
you
read
the
conference
report--
mr.
paul
march
smith
--well,
it
meets
it
because
there
was
a
specific
exception
to
the
not
more
restrictive
criteria
requirement.
the
conference
report
says
we
have
adopted
the
house
bill.
the
criteria
must
be
not
more
restrictive.
and
then
it
says
except
that
we
want
the
secretary
to
assure
that
all
relevant
medical
evidence
is
considered
in
the
process.
so
this
was
a
specific
exception
drawn
from
another
statutory
section
which
they
had
incorporated
into
902(f)(2)
in
the
same
bill.
and
it
doesn't
in
any
way
suggest
that--
mr.
paul
march
smith
--no,
the
statute's
not.
the
conference
report
certainly
says
it's
an
exception,
and
that's
how
they
understood
it.
mr.
paul
march
smith
no,
your
honor,
they
don't.
in
each
of
those
two
contexts,
they
mean
criteria
for
determining
disability.
and
if
you
look
at
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
they
concede
in
their
reply
brief
that
criteria
in
the
former
reference
which
is
a
reference
to
the
social
security
act
includes
both
medical
criteria
and
vocational
criteria,
anything
that
would
ordinarily
go
toward
determining
disability.
we
don't
read
the
word
902(f)(2).
what
we're
saying
is--
mr.
paul
march
smith
--your
honor,
if
i
could
explain
exactly
how
these
people
were
treated,
i
think
it
would
be
clear
that
there
was
no
question
that
the
secretary
was
acting
within
whatever
range
of
discretion
was
left.
it's
important
to
understand
that
if
you
had
less
than
ten
years,
you
were
assessed
under
precisely
the
same
old
1972
permanent
regulations
which
congress
had
specifically
found
to
be
illegal.
these
were
the
ones
that
were
producing
a
less
than
10
percent
approval
rate,
and
they
were--
mr.
paul
march
smith
--well,
two
answers.
first
of
all,
your
honor,
it
is
quite
likely
that
many
of
them
did
have
simple
pneumoconiosis.
the
studies
presented
to
congress
in
1977,
the
autopsy
studies,
showed
that
60
percent
would
have
simple
pneumoconiosis.
mr.
paul
march
smith
well,
it
depends
on
what
you
mean--
mr.
paul
march
smith
--well,
it
depends
on
what
you
mean.
if
you
take
what
congress
meant
by
total
disability,
what
congress
said
is
we
will
give
compensation
where
simple
pneumoconiosis
in
combination
with
other
medical
conditions
prevents
a
person
from
mining
coal.
and
the
congress
repeatedly
found
under
this
statute,
that
simple
pneumoniosis
can
be
and
often
is
totally
disabling.
it
said
so
flatly
in
the
house
report.
mr.
paul
march
smith
exactly
the
same
level
of
pneumoconiosis
as
these
people
had
to
demonstrate
to
achieve
the
interim
presumption
is
what
congress
said
can
be
totally
disabling.
it
often
happens
where
it
is
in
combination
with
other
medical
conditions
that
produces
the
disability.
and
the
effect
of
simple
pneumoconiosis
will
vary
from
person
to
person
depending
on
their
other
characteristics,
but
congress
was
certainly
of
the
view
that
simple
pneumoconiosis
of
this
level
is
totally
disabling
in
a
large
number
of
cases.
it
said
so
flatly
in
the
house
report,
and
that
finding
of
congress
is
implicit
in
the
whole
structure
of
the
statute.
the
statute
from
the
beginning
in
1969
has
irrebuttably
presumed
total
disability
in
a
person
with
complicated
pneumoconiosis.
all
of
the
old
stuff
in
the
statute
that
has
to
do
with
the
adjudications
of
disability
refers
only
to
people
that
have
simple
pneumoconiosis,
which
is
what
these
people
had
to
prove
in
order
to
invoke
the
presumption.
and
there's
no
question
that
congress
thought
these
people
can
be
totally
disabling.
if
there
are
cases,
and
there
certainly
are,
there
they're
not,
then
it's
up
to
the
government
and
the
coal
operator
to
show
that
on
rebuttal.
there's
no
problem
with
rebuttal
of
that
presumption.
congress
though
certainly
came
to
the
conclusion
that
we
don't
the
coal
miner
to
bear
the
burden
of
uncertainty
here
where
it's
difficult
to
establish
disability
and
a
causal
link
between
that
disability
and
the
pneumoconiosis.
so
it's
up
to
the...
you
put
that
into
the
rebuttal
section
of
the
process
deliberately.
now--
mr.
paul
march
smith
--the
two
rebuttal
provisions
which
were
added
by
the
secretary
in
1978,
one
is
rebuttal
based
on
a
showing
that
the
claimant
does
not
in
fact
have
pneumoconiosis.
and
the
other
is
rebuttal
on
the
basis
of
the
showing
that
while
he
has
pneumoconiosis,
the
total
disability
is
not
caused
by
the
pneumoconiosis.
in
other
words
that
the
pneumoconiosis
is
not
severe
enough
to
be
contributing
to
his
disability.
those
are
two
certainly
very
highly
medical
issues.
they're
precisely
the
issues
which
was...
there
was
concern
that
ssa
wasn't
considering,
and
that's
why
they
had
this
statutory
exception.
mr.
paul
march
smith
well,
your
honor,
they
did
allow...
in
no
way
does
the
secretary's
rule
serve
that.
the
claimant
has
to
prove
causation
of
the
disease
by
coal
mine
employment
in
order
to
invoke
the
presumption.
so
we
have
no
concern
about
that.
that
is
an
issue
where
the
burden
of
proof
under
the
statute
remains
on
the
claimant.
mr.
paul
march
smith
well,
the
presumption
does
not
affect
the
issue
of
causation
of
the
disease.
it
shifts
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
issue
of
whether
disease
is
sufficiently
severe
to
be
contributing
to
the
disability.
that's
the
issue
that
it
shifted
the
burden
of
proof
on.
and
i
would
point
out
in
terms
of
who's
bearing
the
burden
here
that
the
vast
majority
of
these
claims
are
going
to
be
paid
out
of
the
trust
fund,
not
cut
of
individual
miner's
funds.
congress
specifically
mandated
that
any
claim
that
was
denied
before
1977
and
granted
afterwards
would
come
from
the
trust
fund
not
from
a
miner.
and
for
that
and
several
other
reasons,
it's
clear
that
there
will
not
be
a
large
number
of
coal
mine
operators
held
individually
liable
under
this
presumption.
mr.
paul
march
smith
but
justice
scalia,
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history,
the
one
thing
that
is
clear
is
that
they
wanted
the
interim
presumption
to
be
available
to
everybody
based
on
a
showing
of
causation
in
pneumoconiosis.
that
was
the
only
feature
of
the
ssa
rules
that
was
in
any
way
different
from
the
labor
rules
prevailing
before
1977.
when
they
passed
the
statute
that
says,
criteria
not
more
restricted
than
those
used
by
ssa,
they
can
have
had
no
other
purpose
than
to
extend
the
interim
presumption
to
everyone.
now
at
that
point
they
did
say,
"we
want
to
make
sure
before
you
give
the
benefits,
once
this
shift
in
the
burden
of
proof
has
been
given,
that
all
of
the
evidence
is
considered.
"
"we
want
to
reject
the
ssa
practice
of
excluding
some
relevant
rebuttals.
"
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
congress'
purpose
was
nothing,
that
they
left
the
secretary
total
discretion
to
leave
people
under
the
same
rules
that
it
had
rejected,
or
to
say
some
people
can't
get
the
presumption
merely
be
virtue
of
a
time
in
the
mines.
the
presumption
was
the
heart
of
what
they
were
giving
people.
mr.
paul
march
smith
a
major
change
in
the
sense
that...
sure,
absolutely.
if
you
had
more
than
10
years
you
had
an
interim
presumption
available--
mr.
paul
march
smith
--yeah,
but
with
respect
to
anybody--
mr.
paul
march
smith
--well,
it's
a
large
number
of
people,
sure.
but
there
are,
certainly
the
numbers
we
hear
thrown
around,
there's
a
large
number
of
people
in
the
other
group
as
well.
and
for
them
the
statutory
change
was
essentially
meaningless.
and
there's
no
indication,
not
one
word
in
the
legislative
history
have
they
cited
to
suggest
that
congress
could
have
anticipated
this.
now,
i
think
in
terms
of
the
arguments--
mr.
paul
march
smith
--not
if
they
had
less
than
10
years
in
the
mines,
justice
stevens.
they
didn't
get
any
presumption
at
all.
mr.
paul
march
smith
no,
they
got
no
presumption
at
all.
if
they
didn't
have
10
years
in
the
mines,
they're
categorically
excluded
from
the
presumption--
mr.
paul
march
smith
--these
people
had
to
prove
everything.
and
that
was
the,
under
standards
that
had
a
less
than
10
percent
approval
rate
before
the
statute
was
passed.
now,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
you
can't
separate
out
causation
from
disability
here
and
say
they
had
complete
discretion
to
tinker
around
with
the
causation
criteria
at
the
same
time
that
they
were
supposed
to
promulgate
equivalent
disability
criteria.
under
the
social
security
interim
presumption
regulation,
which
congress
incorporated,
causation
was
part
and
parcel
of
the
disability
determination.
it
was
one
of
the
elements
you
proved
in
order
to
get
the
presumption
of
disability.
so
the
secretary's
position
amounts
to
the
proposition
that
the
secretary
was
required
to
give
everybody
a
presumption
of
disability
and
at
the
same
time
retain
the
discretion
to
prevent
some
people
from
attempting
to
prove
one
of
the
two
elements
which
led
to
that
presumption.
sort
of
giving
with
the
right
hand
and
taking
away
with
the
left.
and
then
just
a
final
point
on
the
validity
of
the
regulation.
when
you
actually
look
at
what
they
say
about
what
the
secretary
was
really
thinking,
they
abandoned
their
own
theory.
they
don't
talk
about
causation
of
the
disease
at
all.
they
say,
well,
the
secretary
thought
there
was
less
likelihood
they
would
have
severely
disabling
levels
of
pneumoconiosis
if
they
had
less
than
10
years
in
the
mines.
and
whatever's
clear,
if
they
were
trying
to
screen
out
people
because
they
were
less
likely
to
be
disabled,
that's
a
disability
criterion,
not
a
causation
criterion
at
all.
and
on
that
issue,
congress
had
spoken,
said,
give
people
the
presumption
of
disability
because
we,
we,
we
have
incorporated
the
ssa
approach,
and
we're
not
going
to
allow
the
secretary
then
to
just
come
in
and
say,
well,
i
just
think
it's,
i
disagree
with
congress,
i
think
these
people
are
less
likely
to
be
disabled
and
i'm
going
to
not
give
them
exactly
the
benefit
that
congress
wanted.
again
just
a
final,
a
second
final
point
on
this
point.
the
notion
that
congress
in
some
way
ratified
this
when
they
sent
over
this
pile
of
regulations
and
they
didn't
notice
this
problem
is,
is
ridiculous.
there's
no
indication
whatever
in
the
letter
that
congress,
these
three
congressman
had
any
awareness
at
all
that
the
two
interim
presumption
regulations
were
different.
indeed,
mr.
solomons,
in
previous
briefs,
has
asserted
that
nobody
in
congress
was
aware
of
it
and
nobody
in
the
department
was
even
aware
of
it
until
1981
when
it
was
raised
in
the
benefits
review
board.
now,
assuming
that
the
court
determines
that
the
regulation
did
violate
the
statute,
that
these
people
were
supposed
to
get
an
interim
presumption
of
disability,
the
next
question
is
the
scope
of
relief
available
to
the
class
in
sebben,
those
who
did
not
pursue
their
administrative
appeals.
now,
our
position
as
i
explained
a
little
bit
at
the
outset
is
that
exhaustion
is
not
required
here
because
of
section
945,
which
was
a
special
mechanism
created
by
congress
which
mandated
an
absolute
right
to
an
autocratic
reassessment--
mr.
paul
march
smith
--well,
your
honor,
the
case
is
similar
to
a
city
of
new
york
case
a
couple
of
years
ago
where
the
claim
was
being
raised
well
after
the
time
when
the
administrative
remedies
could
have
been
invoked.
and
the
doctrine
that
applies
in
that
situation
is
quite
similar
to
the
doctrine
that
applies
where
you're
trying
to
skip
it,
as
in
mathews
v.
eldridge.
in
either
case,
what
you
have
to
look
for
is
whether
there's
a
collateral
right
separate
from
the
issue
of
substantive
eligibility
for
benefits
in
the
statute,
and
whether
requiring
people
to
go
through
administrative
proceedings
to
enforce
that
right
would
make
sense,
would
be
consistent
with
the
enforcement
of
the
right.
mr.
paul
march
smith
the
difference
is
that
here
you
have
a
specific
mechanism
created
based
on
findings
by
congress,
that
these
people
had
been
treated
so
poorly
by
the
process
over
a
period
of
years
that
the
vast
majority
would
not
even
take
the
step
of
refiling
an
application
after
the
1977
amendments.
congress
specifically
rejected
the
senate
bill's
version
of
this
which
said
they
have
to
come
in
and
refile.
mr.
paul
march
smith
sure,
you
know,
that's
the
argument
that's
raised.
but
when
you
have
these
specific
findings
and
you
have
a
specific
mechanism
that
said,
go
back,
don't
make
them
do
anything.
and
the
automatic
nature
of
this
was
emphasized
repeatedly
in
the
legislative
history,
based
on
the
fact
that
we
know
they
won't
do
anything.
and
be
sure
that
you
apply
the
correct
standards,
apply
them
immediately,
sua
sponte,
give
retroactive
relief
where
it's
appropriate,
if
they've
already
made
their
case.
in
that
situation
for
the
secretary
to
conduct
these
reviews,
applying
exactly
the
standards
that
congress--
mr.
paul
march
smith
--what
you
have
in
effect
is
that
section
945
no
longer
exists
in
the
statute.
mr.
paul
march
smith
but
what
they
got,
mr.
chief
justice,
was
a
review
applying
exactly
the
same
standards
which
had
been
misapplied
to
them
in
the
past,
so
that
there
was
no
potential
for
them
to
gain
anything
from
this.
and
the
one
glaring
figure
that's
been
omitted
from
all
the
filings
in
the
government
in
this
case
is
any
suggestion
that
anybody
who
had
less
than
10
years
of
mining
employment
got
their
benefits
given
to
them
after
they
were
reviewed
after
the
statute.
they
couldn't
have
because
they
didn't
get
anything
new
applied
to
their
case.
mr.
paul
march
smith
your
honor,
in
fact,
in
order
to
get
to
court,
even
if
you
follow
the
administrative
process,
it
still
would
have
taken
10
years.
mr.
broyles
and
mr.
colley
have
been
trying
to
get
here
and
they
are
finally
here.
mr.
paul
march
smith
there's
no
question
about
it.
mr.
paul
march
smith
but,
but
the
requirement
that
they
do
that,
that
they
exhaust,
produced
exactly
the
harm
that
congress
was
trying
to
avoid
when
it
set
up
this
mechanism.
it
didn't
have
to
set
up
this
mechanism.
it
could
have
just
said,
re-adjudicate
claims
where
people
ask
you
to,
and
then
give
them
an
appeal.
instead
it
said,
go
out,
give
them
retroactive
benefits,
we
know
they
won't
refile
if
we
require
them
to
do
anything.
when
the
secretary
then
doesn't
change
his
conduct,
applies
precisely
the
same
old
inappropriate
standards,
and
then
says
exhaust
or
i
won't
give
you
anything,
what
you
have
is
the
massive
abandonment
of
claims
by
at
least
90
percent
of
the
affected
people
that
were
intended
to
benefit,
precisely
the
harm
that
congress
tried
to
avoid.
and
to
say
that
exhaustion
is
required
here
is
to
say
that
congress
can't
do
anything
to
rectify
past
errors,
and
where
the
secretary
has
to
do
it
themselves.
in
a
situation
like
this
it
makes
congress
powerless
to
deal
with
the
problem
where
the
secretary
falls
to
comply
with
the
will
of
congress.
mr.
paul
march
smith
what
they
got
is
notice
that
they
had
been
reviewed
and
that
they
were
again
denied,
because
the
interim
presumptions
still
did
not
apply.
mr.
paul
march
smith
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
of
a
case,
but
i,
i
can't
claim
to
have
studied
the
matter.
i
have
merely
pointed
out
that
the
secretary
has
never
suggested
any
figure
of
that
sort.
and
there's
an
awful
lot
of
figures
being
thrown
around
here.
if
they
could
demonstrate
that
there
was
in
fact
any
substantial
meaning
to
these
reviews
for
the
less-than-10-year
group,
i
think
they
would
have
pointed
that
out.
just
a
moment
on
this
mandamus
point.
we
do
rely
on
a
different
jurisdictional
theory
than
under
city
of
new
and
eldridge,
but
that's
simply
a
result
of
differences
between
the
social
security
act
and
the
black
lung
act.
under
the
social
security
act,
you
can
go
to
the
district
court
from
any
final
order
of
the
secretary,
and
in
city
of
new
york
this
court
determined
that
there
was
such
a
final
order.
here
you
have,
the
only
jurisdictional
grant
in
the
statute
is
under
the
longshoreman's
act,
which
says
you
can
go
to
a
court
of
appeals
from
a
final
order
of
the
benefits
review
board.
and
if
you're
going
to
enforce
a
collateral
right
directly
in
court,
you
obviously
can't
go
to
the
benefits
review
board
and
get
a
final
order
first.
so
we
had
to
go
to
a
non-statutory
jurisdictional
approach.
the
approach
that
was
selected
was
1361
jurisdiction
rather
than
the
usual
1331
jurisdiction
and
apa
review,
because
the
federal
coal
mine
statute
has
a
section
that
says
the
apa
doesn't
apply.
and
there
was
then
some
question
of
whether
1331
was
available.
we
do
think
a
mandamus
is
the
appropriate
statute
here,
if
these
other
routes
were
not
available,
because
it
exists
exactly
to
provide
a
fallback
in
situations
where
federal
officers
are
disobeying
the
law
and
there's
no
other
method
to
enforce
the
law
against
them.
and
certainly
i
think
the
proposition
that
if
we
have
shown
the
regulation
to
be
invalid
that
somehow
we
haven't
shown
it
clear
enough,
asks
it
to
be
cut
too
thinly.
you
have...
if
we
can
overcome
the
usual
deference
to
administrative
discretion
here
and
have
shown
a
flat
inconsistency
between
the
regulation
and
the
statute,
that's
certainly
enough
for
mandamus
as
well.
just
one
more
point
on
the
city
of
new
york
case,
because
i
think
it
is
an
important
case
here.
the
government
and
the
private
petitioners
attempt
to
distinguish
this
case
from
city
of
new
york
on
the
theory
that
there
you
had
a
secret
policy
which
was
not
known
to
people
at
the
time
they
could
have
filed
their
administrative
appeals.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
though,
that
the
whole
last
section
of
that
opinion
dealt
with
people
who
did
have
time
to
file
their
administrative
appeals
at
a
time
when
the
secret
policy
being
applied
in
the
social
security
administration
was
publicly
known.
and
the
court
held
that
even
as
to
those
people
where
you
have
a
right
to
a
valid
first-level
disability
assessment,
and
it's
clear
that
administrative
review
would
be
futile
and
that
there
be
massive
abandonment
of
claims
if
we
require
it,
that
the
court
would,
allowed
direct
enforcement
of
the
collateral
right
in
that
case.
our
case
is
such
easier,
because
you
have
this
special
provision
in
the
statute,
945,
that
said,
reopen
these
things
under
the
1977
amendments.
that
case
is
really
one
where
you,
which
is
much
like
the
one
hypothesized
by
justice
scalia,
one
where
they
simply
were
told
to
apply
the
law
in
the
adjudications
and
they
weren't
doing
it.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
