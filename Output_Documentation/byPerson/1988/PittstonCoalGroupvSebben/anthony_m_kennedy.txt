anthony
m.
kennedy
it
is
not
clear
to
me,
mr.
ayer,
why
if
you
prevail
in
your
argument
that
criteria
means
medical
criteria.
that
we
are
not
confronted
here
with
the
medical
criteria
anyway.
this
was
raised
in
the
briefs.
isn't
disability
ultimately,
significantly
a
medical
judgment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
any
number
of
social
security
cases,
especially
in
the
circuit
courts,
the
courts
look
at
medical
evidence
to
determine
disability.
and
then
you're
telling
us
that
oh,
we
have
to
read
this
regulation
to
that
it
means
medical
criteria,
and
then
respondents
point
out,
what
difference
does
it
make,
you
lose
anyway.
well,
isn't
disability
significantly
a
medical
judgment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
advocating
that
it
says
medical
criteria.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
medical
test
criteria.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
my
question
is
why
isn't
that
a
large
part
of
the
judgment
on
disability
anyway?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
call
it
an
exception.
it
was
in
a
different
section
of
the
statute.
it
wasn't
listed
as
an
exception.
it
just
stated
that
all
relevant
medical
evidence
is
admissible.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
concede
in
your
brief
that
under
the
existing
regulation,
there
are
four
methods
of
rebuttal.
previously,
there
are
two.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
not...
doesn't
meet
the
restrictive
criteria
standard
as
you
interpret
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
house
report
may
call
it
an
exception.
the
statute
isn't
drafted
that
way.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
while
you're
there.
just
one
moment
before
you
leave
that
point.
the
rebuttal
mechanisms
are
phrased
in
terms
other
than
medical.
they
are
talking
about
the
ability
to
work,
et
cetera.
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
quite
inconsistent
with
your
justification
of
the
rebuttals
as
being
under
the
statutory
section
for
all
relevant
medical
evidence.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
each
claimant
get
notice
that
his
or
her
claim
was
being
opened?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
say
that
so
far
as
the
class
of
persons
who
had
worked
under
10
years,
you
know
not
of
a
single
case
where
the
decision
was
favorable
to
the
claimant?
