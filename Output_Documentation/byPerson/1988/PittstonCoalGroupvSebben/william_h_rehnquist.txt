mr.
ayer,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ayer.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
solomons.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
solomons.
we'll
near
now
from
you,
mr.
smith.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
smith,
do
you
contend
that
if
the
secretary
did
follow
what
you
say
was
the
statutory
mandate
and
did
review
a
claim
under
the
guidelines,
do
you
agree
that
that
becomes
final?
if
the
administrative
review
isn't
pursued,
that
that's
not
everlastingly
open?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
you
say
meaningful,
does
that
mean
if
the
secretary
says
i'm
reviewing
your
case
under
the
applicable
law,
but
the
secretary
makes
a
mistake
as
to
the
law,
then
they
can
start
all
over
again
say
five
years
later?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
in
effect
that
the
secretary
makes
an
error
of
law
in
reviewing,
it's
everlastingly
open?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
can
we
tell
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
smith,
i
don't
think
the
government
is
defending
on
the
grounds
of
exhaustion.
exhaustion
says
in
effect,
you
can't
yet
bring
your,
the
doctrine
of
exhaustion
is
you
can't
yet
bring
your
claim
into
court
because
you
should
have
sought
more
administrative
remedies.
here
the
government
is
saying,
you
had
your
review;
the
case
became
final.
that's
not
exhaustion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
congress
said
to
the
secretary,
do
this
again
in
these
cases.
the
secretary
promulgated
these
interim
regulations
and
did
them
under
the
regulations.
now
you
say
the
regulations
were
invalid
and
therefore
these
people
got
nothing.
but
they
did
get
something.
they
got
a
review
which
the
secretary
thought
consistent
with
the
statute.
you
now
say
it
didn't.
but
surely
to
say
that
it
can
be
done
over
is
just
an
attack
on
the
whole
doctrine
of
res
judicata.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ayer.
the
case
is
submitted.
