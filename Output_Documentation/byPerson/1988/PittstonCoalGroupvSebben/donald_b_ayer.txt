mr.
donald
b.
ayer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
respondents
in
these
cases
applied
between
1973
and
1980
for
black
lung
benefits
under
part
c
of
the
black
lung
benefits
act.
the
claims
in
all
instances
were
denied.
some
of
them
were
in
fact
denied
for
the
second
time,
but
all
of
them
were
denied
under
the
department
of
labor's
so-called
interim
regulation
which
was
adopted
in
response
to
the
1977
amendments
to
the
black
lung
benefits
act.
the
courts
of
appeals
below
the
eighth
circuit
and
the
fourth
circuit
struck
down
the
denials
of
these
claims
on
the
ground
that
the
interim
regulation
was
incompatible
with
the
1977
amendments
under
the
provision
which
is
no
codified
at
30
u.s.c.
902(f)(2),
which
requires
that
the
criteria
under
those
interim
standards
be
"not
more
restrictive
than
criteria
applied
by
hew
to
part
(b)
claims
filed
before
july
1,
1973.
"
the
department
of
labor
interim
regulation
is
similar
to
the
hew
rule
in
many
respects.
it
is
a
presumption,
and
i
will
talk
more
later
if
i
get
the
chance
about
the
details
of
it.
it
also
however
has
some
major
differences.
one
of
the
differences
is
a
difference
that
is
an
issue
in
this
case,
and
that
is
the
question
of
how
you
can
invoke
what
i
will
now
call
the
causation
prong
of
the
two-prong
test
necessary
to
invoke
the
presumption
which
exists
under
both
the
hew
interim
rule
and
the
department
of
labor
interim
rule.
under
the
hew
rule,
you
were
required
to
show
that
your
pneumoconiosis
was
caused
by
coal
mine
employment,
and
you
were
allowed
an
inference,
indeed,
a
presumption
to
be
drawn
from
the
fact
that
you
had
ten
years
of
coal
mine
experience,
a
presumption
that
it
was
in
fact
caused
by
coal
mine
employment.
the
difference
in
this
case
which
is
relevant
is
that
under
the
department
of
labor
interim
regulation,
you
simply
must
have
ten
years
of
coal
mine
employment,
and
there
is
no
opportunity
to
prove
causation
in
any
other
way
in
order
to
trigger
the
presumption.
i
should
note
and
i
think
it
is
clear
from
the
briefs,
that
in
any
event
if
the
presumption
is
not
invoked,
there
is
still
an
opportunity
to
prove
entitlement
to
benefits
by
going
back
to
permanent
regulations
in
effect,
allowing
you
to
prove
all
the
elements,
that
is,
total
disability,
pneumoconiosis,
and
causation
by
coal
mine
employment.
our
position
in
this
case--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--that
is
true
as
to
both
b
and
c.
there
is
some
confusion
now
in
the
courts
of
appeals
as
to
precisely
which
set
of
permanent
regulations
you
go
back
to,
but
you
have
an
opportunity
under
both
to
go
back
and
prove
that--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
the
permanent
regulations
are
different
in
some
significant
respects,
and
it
would
take
a
good
long
time
to
go
through
all
the
ways
in
which
they
are
different.
and
it's
enough
off
the
point
here
that
i
would
like
to
pass
over
that
if
i
can.
the
position
of
the
government
in
this
case
is
that
they
are
not...
this
difference
is
not
a
more
restrictive
criteria
because
the
appropriate
reading
of
criteria
within
the
meaning
of
section
902(f)(2),
looking
to
the
legislative
context
and
trying
to
make
sense
out
of
the
amendments
passed
in
1977
is
to
read
it
as
essentially
medical
test
criteria.
now,
in
that
regard,
and
in
order
to
come
to
that
conclusion,
it
is
important
and
necessary
i
think
to
look
to
the
background
of
the
amendments
in
1977
which
were
in
fact...
it's
clear
from
the
hearings
and
the
debate...
a
political
compromise
which
like
many
political
compromises
had
an
ambiguous
result.
the
main
focus,
if
you
can
say
that,
of
the
debate
throughout
the
mid
1970s
was
that
there
were
different
results
reached
under
the
hew
interim
rules
which
applied
to
claims
filed
prior
to
1973
and
under
the
so-called
part
b
program,
and
the
results
reached
under
the
permanent
regulations
which
the
department
of
labor
was
required
to
apply
to
part
c
claims
where
the
claims
were
filed
after
mid-1973.
that
was
the
main
focus.
there
are
different
views
that
were
taken
in
the
legislature
and
in
the
testimony
that
was
given
of
that
difference.
one
view
was
the
view...
i
can
encapsulate
in
the
notion
that
the
department
of
labor
approval
rate
was
unreasonably
low,
and
something
had
to
be
done
about
it.
its
approval
rate
at
that
time
was
something
under
10
percent.
one
of
the
main
focuses
of
that
criticism
was
the
fact
that
medical
test
criteria,
specifically,
the
ventilatory
study
scores,
that
were
applied
under
the
hew
permanent
regulations
that
the
department
of
labor
had
to
apply
were
tougher,
significantly
tougher,
than
the
ventilatory
study
scores
applied
under
the
hew
interim
presumption.
that
was
one
of
the
major
focuses
of
the
criticism,
and
a
major
explanation
of
the
difference,
not
the
only
explanation,
but
a
major
one.
this
general
view
that
the
department
of
labor
approval
rate
was
too
low
and
something
had
to
be
done
about
it
was
embodied
in
the
house
bill
which
was
passed
in
1977,
and
especially,
although
not
again
solely,
embodied
in
the
language
which
said
that
they
were
to
apply
criteria
"not
more
restrictive
than
the
criteria
applied
under
the
hew
interim
presumption
under
part
b..
"
a
second
view,
again
not
mutually
exclusive
with
this
first
one,
but
certainly
a
very
different
emphasis,
was
a
view
that
saw...
that
expressed
significant
doubts
about
the
accuracy
of
the
standards
and
the
process
that
was
being
applied
in
general,
and
particularly,
that
was
being
applied
by
hew
under
the
interim
regulation.
that
is
to
say,
the
extent
to
which...
doubts
about
the
extent
to
which
they
were
really
identifying
cases
of
people
who
were
disabled
with
pneumoconiosis
from
coal
mine
employment
as
opposed
to
simply
paying
benefits
to
people
who
were
coal
miners
of
middle
or
advanced
years
who
were
able
to
meet
certain
criteria
that
really
didn't
demonstrate
that
they
had
the
conditions
that
the
statute
was
aimed
at.
this
general
view,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say,
was
embodied
in
the
senate
bill
which
was
passed
in
1977
which
called
for
the
re-promulgation
of
standards,
permanent
standards,
by
the
department
of
labor
taking
a
different
approach
really.
not
so
much
treating
it
as
an
entitlement
program
as
treating
it
as
a
workers'
compensation
program
and
specifically
trying
to
identify
medical
tests
necessary
to
establish
whether
someone
is
or
is
not
totally
disabled
with
pneumoconiosis
from
coal
mine
employment.
and
specifically,
they
enacted
in
the
senate
bill
a
provision
that
says
the
department
of
labor
shall
promulgate
criteria
for
all
appropriate
medical
tests
which
accurately
reflect
total
disability
in
coal
miners.
the
conference
committee
put
together
essentially,
in
what
really
i
think
has
to
be
described
as
an
uneasy
compromise,
both
the
provisions
of
the
house
bill
and
the
provisions
of
the
senate
bill,
and
to
a
significant
degree,
tried
to
serve
both
purposes.
on
the
one
hand,
they
called
for
the
promulgation
of
new
permanent
regulations
in
the
words
of
the
senate
bill,
criteria
for
all
appropriate
medical
tests
to
be
promulgated
with
the
consultation
of
the
national
institute
of
occupational
safety
and
health
and
to
be
done
permanently,
and
they
realized
it
would
take
some
period
of
time
to
do
that.
as
to
the
interim
period,
before
the
promulgation
of
those
permanent
regulations,
i
must
say
i
think
the
signals
were
somewhat
mixed
as
to
precisely
what
was
supposed
to
be
done.
on
the
one
hand,
the
house
bill's
language
talking
about
criteria
not
more
restrictive
than
the
hew
provision,
the
hew
interim
regulation,
was
included.
and
there's
no
question
that
they
intended
to
move
a
good
deal
closer
to
approximating
what
the
hew
administration
was
doing
than
had
been
done
by
the
department
of
labor
previously.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i
think
that
that
is
certainly...
i
think
there
is
a
good
deal
of
evidence
for
that
in
various
parts
of,
if
you
pick
and
choose
and
you
don't
have
to
pick
and
choose
too
carefully,
you
can
certainly
find
people
who
said
things
that
indicated
that
with
regard
to
the
enactment
of
the
house
bill.
i
think
it
is
a
good
deal
harder
to
find
that
supported
with
regard
to
the
senate
bill
because
they
simply
didn't
take
any
such
step.
and
i
think
what
we
need
to
do
is
to
try
analyze
what
was
the
intent
in
enacting
the
compromise,
which
was
the
conference
bill,
because
that
actually
is
what
was
enacted.
and
in
that
regard,
i
would
not
suggest
that
the
words
are
wholly
unambiguous,
but
there
are
indications
that
they
intended
something
which
is
quite
a
lot
different
than
simply
whatever
hew
was
doing.
they
did
not
want
the
same
results
that
hew
achieved,
and
that
is
indicated
by
a
number
of
different
sources
that
we
can
turn
to.
one
is
the
conference
report
itself
where
they
indicated,
and
i
quote:
"the
conference
substitute
conforms
to
the
senate
amendment
with
the
proviso
that
the
so-called
interim
part
b
medical
standards
are
to
be
applied
to
all
reviewed
and
pending
claims.
"
"such
regulations,
that
is,
the
interim
regulations
shall
not
provide
more
restrictive
criteria
than
those
applicable
to
a
claim
filed
on
june
30,
1973,
except
that
in
determining
claims
under
such
criteria,
all
relevant
medical
evidence
shall
be
considered
in
accordance
with
the
standards
prescribed
by
the
secretary
of
labor.
"
they
did
not
say
in
any
of
the
bills
and
certainly
not
in
the
final
act
as
passed
that
they
were
trying
to
mirror
precisely
what
hew
had
done.
they
did
not
indicate
as
they
could
easily
have
done
had
they
wanted
to
that
the
department
of
labor
was
simply
to
re-promulgate
the
hew
interim
regulation
in
exact
terms.
it's
quite
clear
they
didn't
intend
that
at
all.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i
think
the
words
medical
criteria,
as
has
been
indicated
in
the
briefs,
is
not
itself
wholly
unambiguous.
but
i
think
when
you
look
to
the
specific
focus
of
much
of
the
tension
which
was
a
very
concrete
difference
in
ventilatory
study
scores
that
you
had
to
have
in
order
to
qualify
for
the
presumption
under
part
b
under
the
interim
regulation
as
opposed
to
a
table
that
looked
very
much
the
same
except
it
had
different
numbers
on
it
that
applied
under
the
so-called
permanent
regulations
the
department
of
labor
had
to
apply.
and
it
was
very
clear
that
that
particular
difference
made
a
significant
difference
simply
turning
on
the
day
on
which
you
applied
as
to
whether
you
qualified
or
not.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
don't
think,
we
are
not
advocating
a
reading
that
indicates
simply
there's
a
medical
judgment
involved.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
medical
test
criteria.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
okay.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
it
certainly
can
be.
but
we
do
think
it
is
not
dispositive,
and
it
does
not...
those
kind
of
criteria
do
not
include
the
decision
by
the
department
of
labor
whether
or
not
to
allow
proof
of
causation,
that
is,
proof
of
causation
by
coal
mine
employment
by
means
other
than
the
fact
that
you
had
ten
years
of
coal
mine
employment.
that
is
a
judgment
about
how
the
case
will
be
adjudicated
and
what
kinds
of
evidence
will
be
allowed
in.
the--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
i
think
what
has
to
be
kept
in
mind
is
that
the
department
of
labor
was
operating
in
the
face
of
what
were
indeed
competing
signals.
and
one
of
the
ways
they
tried
to
deal
with
that
problem
was
to
go
back
to
congress
and
present
to
the
leadership
in
the
legislature
what
it
was
they
were
doing.
the
presented
one
set
of
regulations
which
were
found
to
be
quite
inappropriate.
they
presented
another
set
which
were
found
to
be
by
and
large
acceptable,
including
this
provision
which
no
one
challenged
at
all.
the
one
thing
that
i
think
needs
to
be
gotten
cut
is
that
somehow
we
have
to
read
the
statute
in
a
way
that
allows
the
existence
of
additional
rebuttal
criteria
under
the
dol
regulation
which
do
exist
which
i
think
clearly
are
appropriate
and
which
all
parties
here
agree
are
appropriate.
and
somehow
it
has
to
be
found
that
the
statute's
prohibition
against
more
restrictive
criteria
doesn't
bar
that.
i
think
it's
a
difficult
thing
to
do,
and
the
most
sensible
way
to
do
it
is
to
go
back
to
the
compromise
that
was
entered
into,
where
on
the
one
hand
they
wanted
to
come
a
good
deal
closer
to
what
hew
was
doing
under
the
interim
regulation
while
at
the
same
time
not
mirroring
the
results
which
they
reached.
i
would
like
to
just
address
briefly,
if
i
could,
the
second
issue
which
the
court
will
have
to
reach
should
it
decide
that
in
fact
the
merits
issue
was
properly
decided
against
the
position
of
the
government.
and
that
is
essentially
the
question
of
whether
parties,
claimants
who
have
had
their
claims
finally
decided
against
them
can
come
in
in
1985,
where
the
date
for
filing
claims
closed
in
1980,
and
all
of
them
had
had
exercised
whatever
opportunity
they
wanted
to
and
had
available
to
seek
review
of
their
claim
denials,
to
come
in
with
a
mandamus
action
in
order
to
direct
that
the
claims
be
reopened.
the
main
point
i
want
to
make
with
regard
to
that
is
that
that
is
simply
not
a
reasonable
reading
of
the
statutory
provision
with
which
we're
dealing
here.
section
945(b)of
title
30
u.s.c.
says
that
the
secretary
is
to
review
each
claim...
that
is,
each
claim
which
is
pending
or
has
previously
been
decided
at
the
time
these
amendments
go
into
effect...
"taking
into
account
the
1977
amendments.
"
the
department
of
labor
did
this.
the
department
of
labor
adopted
these
interim
regulations,
which
were
not
an
easy
thing
to
enact,
but
they
adopted
them.
they
considered
these
cases
under
them.
they
reopened
many
cases.
there's
nothing
in
945(b)
that
suggests
that
these
cases
were
to
essentially
be
reopened
for
all
time.
and
that
any
time
anyone
should
come
in
at
whatever
year
in
the
future
and
raise
a
question
about
the
interim
regulation,
that
these
people
could
come
back
and
their
claims
would
spring
back
into
existence.
it's
contrary
to
the
notion
of
res
judicata.
it
has
frightening
practical
implications.
twenty-eight
hundred
cases
alone
in
the
eighth
circuit,
and
that's
a
tiny
fraction
of
the
total
in
the
country,
would
have
to
be
reopened.
and
furthermore,
mandamus
is
not
the
avenue
to
pursue
such
relief
even
if
the
statute
were
to
properly
read
as
is
indicated.
mandamus
is
a
remedy
available
where
there
is
essentially
a
clear
and
indisputable
right.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
neither
the
right
claimed
under
945
nor
the
right
claimed
on
the
merits
issue
is
what
you
describe
as
clear
and
indisputable,
and
on
that
basis,
we
would
urge
strongly
that
in
any
event,
the
relief
given
to
the
seven
claimants
is
inappropriate.
i
would
like
to
save
the
remaining
time
if
i
may
for
rebuttal.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
would
just
like
to
make
two
points.
one
is
that
the
1977
amendments
did
indeed
do
some
significant
things
to
help
miners
with
less
than
10
years
of
experience.
it
expanded
the
definition
of
pneumoconiosis,
it
put
a
prohibition
on
rereading
x-rays
to
disqualify
people,
it
made
clear
that
a
worker's
compensation
concept
of
causation
that
allowed
only
partial
causation
to
be
enough
was
sufficient,
and
it
gave
a
right
to
a
full
pulmonary
exam
in
order
to
generate
the
evidence
you
needed.
the
other
point
i'd
like
too
make
is
that
this,
these
interim
regulations
rest
on
a
solid
foundation
in
the
legislative
record.
the
conference
committee
made
clear
in
the
report
that
the
conferees
also
intended
all
standards
are
to
incorporate
presumptions
contained
in
another
section
of
the
act.
the
presumptions
include
the
presumption
of
causation
from
10
years
of
coal
mine
experience,
which
this
provision
in
these
interim
regulations
essentially
is
identical
with.
secondly,
the
scientific
data
which
was
appended
to
a
number
of
reports
throughout
and
to
the
final
house
report
includes
information
that
indicates
that
10
years
is
sort
of
the
presumptive
beginning
for
serious
black
lung
problems.
