may
i
interrupt.
you
say
it's
a
disease
not
likely
to
afflict
short-term
coal
miners.
i
thought
it
was
a
progressive
disease,
and
in
the
simple
stages
it
might
well
be
found
in
short-term
coal
miners,
but
it's
highly
improbable
that
that
simple
disease
would
be
totally
disabling.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
it
not
true
that
there
is
a
period
before
ten
years
where
simply
pneumoconiosis
will
appear
but
it
is
highly
likely
that
it's
totally
disabling.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
isn't
it
also
true
that
there
are
times
when
the
disease
has
manifested
itself,
but
it's
highly
unlikely
that
it's
totally
disabling
in
its
early
stages.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
i
am
asking
a
question
of
fact.
isn't
that
a
fact
that
there
are
many
times
when
a
very
simple
stage
of
the
disease
that
occurs,
but
it's
highly
unlikely
that
it's
totally
disabling.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
the
very
same
standard.
are
they
the
very
same
medical
standards
too,
or
is
it
just
the
ten
year
presumption
that
was
different?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
mr.
smith...
i
hate
to
interrupt
in
your
answer,
but
it's
quite
important
at
this
point.
isn't
it
highly
improbable
based
on
the
empirical
data
that
people
who
had
less
than
ten
years
underground
were
totally
disabled
as
a
result
of
pneumoconiosis
is
even
though
it
was
fairly
likely
that
they
might
have
had
a
very
simple
beginning
stage
of
the
disease?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
how
many
of
those
under
ten
years
had
permanent
disability
as
a
result
of
that
simple
disease?
justice
john
paul
stevens
according
to
the
empirical
data
that
congress
looked
at?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
after
two
or
three
years
of
coal
mine
employment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
wasn't
there
a
major
change
with
respect
to
everyone
who
had
at
least
10
years
of
coal
mine
employment,
either
under,
under
either
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
was
different
than
it
was
before.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
most
of
the
people,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
was
it
meaningless?
because
if
they
could
prove
pneumoconiosis
they
then
did
get
the
presumption
of
total
disability
and
that
it
was
caused
by
that
disease.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
they
proved
they
had
the
disease,
in
a
simple
form,
they
got
the
other
two
prongs,
didn't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
that's
right,
i'm
sorry.
