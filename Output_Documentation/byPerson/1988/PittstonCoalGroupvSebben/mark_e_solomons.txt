mr.
mark
e.
solomons
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
for
the
u.s.
coal
and
insurance
industries,
the
two
central
questions
that
are
presented
here
are
matters
of
fundamental
fairness
and
economic
stability.
the
secretary
of
labor
in
drafting
his
own
version
of
the
interim
presumption
could
not
replicate
the
social
security
administration
rule.
the
validity
of
the
secretary's
action
in
this
regard
in
drafting
his
own
interim
presumption
presents
obviously
complex
questions
of
interpretation.
but
we
think
that
those
questions
become
far
less
difficult
it
the
language
to
be
interpreted
is
reviewed
and
analyzed
with
an
appreciation
for
the
special
dynamics
of
the
six-year
long
process
that
ultimately
produced
the
department
of
labor
rule.
from
the
very
beginning
in
1969,
the
social
security
administration
program
was
a
distinct
and
different
phenomenon
from
that
that
was
entrusted
to
the
department
of
labor.
it
was
different
intent
and
it
was
different
in
its
design.
if
the
social
security
program
had
this
monolithic
purpose
to
simply
pay
as
many
claims
as
it
possibly
could,
that
was
not
the
intent
that
congress
had
for
the
department
of
labor
program.
no
one
expected
that
this
same
one
dimensional
approach
would
be
adequate
at
a
time
when
the
coal
industry
was
called
upon
rather
than
the
federal
general
revenues
to
pay
the
benefits
that
were
to
be
awarded.
the
labor
department's
program
is
a
workers'
compensation
program.
it
is
financed
by
employees,
and
employers
have
the
right
to
litigate
cases
and
to
contest
non-meritorious
claims.
employers
also
have
a
right
to
have
rules
and
regulations
under
which
these
cases
are
to
be
adjudicated
that
are
fair
and
valid
both
from
a
statutory
point
of
view
and
from
the
point
of
view
of
what
their
contents
provide.
the
department
of
labor's
10
year
rule
and
its
rebuttal
provisions,
which
still
remain
in
this
case
and
it
was
decided
i
think
in
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
below,
should
be
sustained
by
this
court
unless
they
were
prohibited
or
irrational.
it
cannot
be
argued
that
the
department
of
labor's
presumption
is
irrational
or
in
any
way
unfair
to
claimants.
that
is
an
argument
that
cannot
be
made.
the
presumption
that
the
secretary
of
labor
wrote
is
probably
the
most
plaintiff-favorable
rule
that
has
ever
been
written
by
a
federal
agency,
and
has
delivered
billions
of
dollars
in
benefits
to
hundreds
of
thousands
of
claimants,
many
of
whom
do
not
have
black
lung
disease
or
any
disability
that's
related
to
black
lung
disease.
and
this
is
well
documented
by
successor
reports
of
the
comptroller
general.
this
is
a
program,
the
department
of
labor
program,
which
has
never
been
criticized
by
congress.
congress
from
1969,
1970
through
1972,
through
1978
strongly
criticized
the
programs
of
the
social
security
administration
as
being
too
restrictive,
and
criticized
the
programs
of
the
department
of
labor
as
being
too
restrictive.
that
has
never
happened
here.
this
presumption
that
the
labor
department
wrote,
and
particularly,
we
will
focus
on
its
10
year
provision,
should
be
analyzed
in
the
sense
that
it
was
not
unreasonable
for
the
secretary
of
labor
to
limit
access
to
this
extraordinarily
powerful
presumption,
where
the
undisputed
scientific
evidence
that
was
presented
to
the
congress
demonstrated
that
short-term
coal
miners
are
quite
unlikely
to
contract
black
lung
disease,
and
that
even
if
they
did
contract
black
lung
disease,
the
likelihood
of
it
manifesting
in
a
disabling
stage
is
almost
nill.
it
simply
doesn't
happen.
there
is
no
scientific
evidence
to
support
that
approach.
it
was
not
unreasonable
for
the
secretary
of
labor
to
begin
from
that
premise
and
to
apply
a
10
year
screening
provision.
of
course,
this
does
not
as
the
solicitor
general
pointed
cut,
prohibit
these
people
from
getting
benefits.
any
one
of
them
who
can
come
forward
with
direct
proof
of
totally
disabling
pneumoconiosis
under
criteria,
which
in
a
report
to
congress
in
1983
prepared
for
the
department
of
labor
at
the
request
of
congress
demonstrated
we're
still
extraordinarily
liberal.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
the
other
criteria?
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
the
other
criteria
also
contain
presumptions
which
require
a
certain
period
of
coal
mine
employment,
but
if
a
miner
worked
for
one
day--
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
--ten
years,
or
15
years
in
certain
circumstances.
if
a
miner
worked
for
one
day
and
contracted
black
lung,
which
is
in
fact
impossible,
but
if
that
were
to
happen,
that
miner
can
get
benefits
under
this
statute
on
direct
proof
presented
by
his
physicians
that
he's
disabled
by
the
disease.
it
can
happen.
it
happens
many
times.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
he
would
have
to
prove
causation
and
he
would
have
to--
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
--well,
it
would
be
as
in
any
other
civil
litigation,
there
are
elements--
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
--he
would
have
to
prove
causation,
yes.
and
that's
really
the
only...
other
than
with
respect
to
the
rebuttal
provisions,
that's
really
the
only
difference
here
between
the
secretary
of
labor's
rule
and
the
ssa
rule.
under
the
secretary
of
labor's
rule,
claimant
must
go
back
and
establish
causation
and
establish
his
disability
if
he
is
a
short-term
miner.
it
was
a
line
drawing
process,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is...
what
the
secretary
of
labor
did
is
perfectly
consistent
with
what
congress
did
in
writing
the
statute.
when
congress
wrote
the
statute,
it
did
not
provide
any
presumptions
to
anybody
who
is
a
short-term
miner.
this
legislative
history
which
is
vast,
and
this
statute
contains
absolutely
not
one
word
of
concern
about
restrictive
provisions
or
anything
else
having
to
do
with
the
unfair
treatment
of
short-term
coal
miners.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
this
is
not
a
disease
which
is
likely
to
afflict
short-term
coal
miners.
if
it
does,
they
can
get
benefits.
but
if
it
does
not,
it
is
not
unreasonable
for
the
secretary
to
require
them
to
prove
the
elements
of
their
case.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
well,
the
materials
that
we've
cited
in
our
brief
show
that
the
disease
is
not
manifest,
period,
in
short-term
coal
miners,
and
those
with
fewer
than
10
years
of
coal
mine
employment.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
well,
the
fact
is
that
the
information
that
we
have
presented
and
that
was
presented
to
congress
showed
that
they
didn't
get
the
disease
at
all.
it
is
true
that
once
the
disease
manifests,
it
may
but
does
not
necessarily
progress
to
more
advanced
stages.
but
let
me
point
out
something
else.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
if
that
was
the
case,
then
these
individuals
are
never
precluded
from
coming
back
and
filing
a
claim.
they
can...
everyone
is--
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
--that's
true.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
and
as
the
court
so
found
in
turner
alcourt.
i
think
it's
also
critical
here
in
terms
of
analyzing
this
that
there
is
really
no
definitive
guidance
from
this
statute
that
cuts
with
surgical
precision.
clearly
the
word
"criteria"
does
not
do
so.
the
word
"criteria"
in
the
statute,
criteria
for
total
disability,
it
does
not
say
criteria
for
causation
of
disease.
these
are
words
that
by
their
very
nature
call
out
for
some
interpretation.
we
also
have
a
setting
here
where
the
secretary
of
labor
was
directed
to
write
his
own
regulations
and
to
consider
all
relevant
evidence
in
writing
those
regulations.
we
have
a
situation
in
which
the
secretary
of
labor
was
directed
to
also
apply
the
statutory
presumptions
which
require
ten
years
of
coal
mine
employment.
this
forms...
these
various
directions
form
a
package
which
the
secretary
of
labor
put
together
in
a
regulation
which
is
still
extraordinarily
fair
to
claimants,
extraordinarily
fair
to
claimants.
and
we
think
there
is
certainly
sufficient
ambiguity
in
the
specific
statements
that
congress
made,
and
clearly
there
is
from
this
process.
i
think
it's
undeniable.
that
the
secretary
of
labor
had
flexibility
in
designing
a
rule
which
would
meet
with
congressional
expectations.
but
even
perhaps
more
importantly
here,
this
rule,
the
rule
that
the
secretary
of
labor
wrote,
was
subject
to
a
de
facto
veto,
not
by
congress,
but
by
the
three
people
with
the
most,
a
proprietary
interest
in
this
provision.
three
members
of
the
conference
committee,
the
officers
of
the
substantive
committee
in
which
the
statute
was
designed.
and
the
secretary
of
labor,
through
the
regulatory
process,
took
those
regulations
up
there
to
the
hill
and
asked
is
this
okay.
and
once
they
said,
no.
this
is
contemporary
with
the
process
during
the
same
session
of
congress
during
the
same
year,
went
back
and
redid
it.
brought
them
back
up
there
and
then
with
specific
reference
to
these
particular
provisions,
with
specific
reference
to
the
10
year
requirement
that
the
secretary
could
put
in
his
regulations,
these
same
three
members
of
congress.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
i
doubt
it,
sir.
