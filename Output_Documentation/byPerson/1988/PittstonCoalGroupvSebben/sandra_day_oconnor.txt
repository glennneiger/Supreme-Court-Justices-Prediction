justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
ayer,
one
does
get
the
impression
at
least
that
the
over-arching
purpose
of
congress
was
to
make
sure
that
miners
who
would
have
been
entitled
to
benefits
under
hew's
interim
part
b
regulations
would
be
entitled
to
benefits
under
labor's
interim
part
c
regulations.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
smith,
section
402(f)
uses
the
words
(1)
in
referring
to
total
disability.
and
then
in
subsection
(2),
the
context
in
which
we
consider
it
here.
i
take
it
under
your
view,
the
words
mean
something
different
in
each
of
these
subsections
then.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
means
a
little
something
different
in
both
places
which
certainly
indicates
to
me
there
may
be
some
room
here
for
agency
interpretation
of
what's
included.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
smith,
these
amendments
had
the
effect,
did
they
not,
of
shifting
the
financial
responsibility
to
the
coal
mine
operator
or
employer.
and
isn't
it
logical
that
congress
would
have
been
concerned
in
making
that
massive
shift
of
economic
responsibility
to
permit
the
operator
to
show
that
the
disease
was
not
caused
by
coal
mine
employment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
the
presumption
affects
that
of
course.
