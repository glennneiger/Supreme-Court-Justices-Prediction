justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
ayer,
the
problem
i
have
is
i
find
the
intent
that
you
ask
us
to
attribute
to
this
statute
a
very
implausible
one.
you're
telling
us
that
congress
was
very
concerned
that
you
use
medical
criteria
in
your
sense,
test
criteria,
that
are
no
more
strict
than
what
hew
had
been
using.
but
so
long
as
you
do
that
you
can
import
all
other
sorts
of
qualifications
that
will
reduce
the
number
of
successful
claimants,
including
if
you
haven't
been
a
coal
miner
for
ten
years,
you
don't
get
the
benefit
of
the
presumption
at
all.
i
suppose
you
could
have
said
20
years
or
30
years.
that's
a
weird
intent.
you
have
to
be
no
more
strict
on
the
medical
criteria,
but
as
for
everything
else,
you
can
tighten
it
up
as
much
as
you
like.
why
would
they
have
that
kind
of
an
intent?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
they
changed
their
minds.
maybe
it
wasn't
an
election
year.
they
didn't
care
as
much.
a
whole
lot
of
things
could
explain
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
smith,
could
i
ask
this
about
your
theory
on
the
liability
part.
you
acknowledge
as
i
recall
that
the
difference
in
the
rebuttal
criteria
including
medical
portions
of
the
rebuttal
criteria
are
okay.
you're
not
challenging
that.
well,
once
you
give
that
away,
how
can
you
say
that
criteria
means
everything?
you're
drawing
a
line
it
seems
to
be
that
appears
as
little
in
the
text
of
the
statute
as
does
the
government's.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
smith,
if
seems
to
me
that
if
we
accept
your
explanation
of
those
two
new
rebuttal
elements
as
both
being
medical,
then
everything
is
medical.
i
mean
if
you
can
say
whether
it's
severe
enough
to
cause
the
disability,
that's
a
medical
judgment.
i
suppose
it's
also
a
medical
judgment
whether
you're
totally
disabled
because
of...
every
single
element
of
the
thing,
the
causation,
the
total
disability,
there's
nothing
that
can't
be
called
a
medical
judgment
in
the
broad
sense
that
you're
using
that
term.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
the
distinction
you
draw
between
this
statute
that
you
say
requires
that
we
let
the
secretary,
make
the
secretary
do
it
over
again.
and
any
statute
which
requires
an
agency
head
to
make
a
certain
decision,
pursuant
to
certain
criteria.
and
the
agency
head
purports
to
do
that,
but
he
makes
a
mistake,
and
the
applicant
doesn't
appeal,
and
we
say
the
case
is
final.
and
the
lawyer
doesn't
come
before
us
and
say,
well,
it
can't
be
final
because
what
the
statute
says
is
that
the
secretary
had
to
do
this
and
he
didn't
do
it.
i
mean,
that's
not
a
very
persuasive
argument.
everybody...
assuming
he
didn't
do
it,
still
in
all
the
time
has
passed.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
argument
could
be
made
with
any
statute.
you
can
say,
you
know,
you
can
say
to
the
court,
congress
wanted
this
to
be
done.
it
cared
very
much
about
this
statute.
and
the
secretary
made
a
mistake.
we
would
still
say,
that's
too
bad,
you
should
have
told
us
at
the
time
you
made
the
mistake
and
not
come
around
10
years
later.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
really
bad
mistake.
is
that
going
to
be
the
criterion
when
the
secretary
makes
a
really
bad
mistake,
there's
no
statute
of
limitations?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
they
didn't...
you
say
there
was
no
potential
for
them
to
get
anything
from
it,
they
could
have
gotten
everything
from
it
if
they
had
come
before
the
courts
then,
when
it
was
wrongfully
denied,
instead
of
coming
around
10
years
later.
they
were
able
to
go
to
court
to
appeal
the
secretary's
determination,
weren't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
whatever,
they
could
appeal
the
wrongful
denial,
at
the
time
it
was
wrongfully
denied.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
can't
say
they
didn't
have
an
opportunity
to
get
anything.
they
did
have
the
opportunity.
justice
antonin
scalia
one
very...
well,
never
mind.
thank
you,
mr.
smith.
mr.
ayer,
you
have
one
minute
remaining.
