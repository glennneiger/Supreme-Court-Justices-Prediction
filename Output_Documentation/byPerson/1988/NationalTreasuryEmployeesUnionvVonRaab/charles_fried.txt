mr.
charles
fried
thank
you,
mr
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
fourth
amendment
says
that
the
right
of
the
people
to
be
secure
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
shall
not
be
violated.
our
principal
contention
here
is
that
what
the
customs
service
has
done
is
entirely
reasonable.
let
me
focus
in
a
little
bit
more
on
the...
on
the
program
we
have,
and
i
think
it's
very
well
described
in
petitioners'
amici,
the
af
of
l-cio.
on
page
4
of
their
brief,
the
af
of
l-cio
writes,
this
program
"applies
only
to
a
self-selected
subgroup
of
employees:
those
who
voluntarily
apply
for
a
promotion
to
a
new
job
for
which
some
inquiry
into
the
employees'
fitness
for
duty
must
be
conducted.
"
and
then
a
footnote
goes
on
to
say:
"indeed,
of
these
applicants,
only
those
who
are
tentatively
selected
for
promotion
are
required
to
undergo
the
test,
and
before
being
so
required
these
individuals
are
permitted
to
withdraw.
"
i
would
only
add
that
if
they
do
withdraw,
this
has
no
employment
consequences
and
they
are
free
to
reapply
at
any
time.
it
seems
to
us
that
this
program
so
described
is
a
very
long
way
from
what
the
fourth
amendment
was
originally
intended
to
cover.
nevertheless...
nevertheless...
over
the
years
and
through
many
decisions
of
this
court,
it's
quite
clear
that
government
programs
that
implicate
privacy
and
dignitary
interests
of
the
individual
come
within
the
gravitational
force
of
the
fourth
amendment.
and
we
don't
dispute
that.
what's
also
clear,
however,
is
that
the
further
you
come
from
the
central
case
of
an
abrupt,
coercive
intrusion
upon
the
individual
in
a
criminal
context,
the
less
appropriate
it
is
to
think
in
terms
of
probable
cause
and
the
warrant
and
the
more
we're
thrown
back
on
the
overarching
test
of
reasonableness
which
the
amendment
itself
specifically
sets
forward.
now,
that
reasonableness
is
the
product
of
a
balance,
a
balance
of
the
seriousness
of
the
government's
interest,
on
one
hand,
and
the
intrusion
on
the
individual,
its
nature,
its
context,
its
timing.
mr.
charles
fried
it
is
an
element
in
the
balance,
and
i
think
that's
an
important
point
to
talk
about
because
it's
hard
to
argue...
and
nobody
seriously
argues...
that
the
government
does
not
have
a
very
serious
interest
in
assuring
that
those
who
are
on
the
front
line
of
drug
interception
are
not
themselves
involved
in
drugs.
and
that
does
not
mean
just
on
the
job,
but
the
weekend
before
or
the
week
before
or
the
month
before.
that's
quite
clear.
what
is
urged
against
this
program
and
what
is
said
to
argue
against
its
reasonableness
is
that
this
is
not
as
effective
as
it
might
be
in
weeding
out
drug
users.
but
that
seems
to
us
a
rather
curious
objection.
we
are
told
that
it's
possible
to
defeat
the
test.
all
you
have
to
do
is
abstain
from
drugs
for
a
period
of
from
five
days
to...
we
heard
mr.
mann
say
in
the
previous
case...
up
to
60
days.
now
it
seems
to
us
that
the
very
indefiniteness
of
that
time
horizon
is
going
to
have
an
effect.
it
will
deter
persons
from
applying
for
the
job
because
they
can't
be
sure
if
they
have
been
involved
in
a
drug,
that
they're
going
to
be
drug-free.
mr.
charles
fried
the
incidence
is
certainly
small,
and
we
do
not
contest
that.
it
is
not,
however,
nonexistent.
mr.
charles
fried
not
nonexistent.
there
are
very
small
number
of
cases.
we
have,
in
fact--
mr.
charles
fried
--yes,
sir.
the
most
recent
information,
which
i'll
be
happy
to
lodge
with
the
court--
mr.
charles
fried
--at
the
time
the
case
was
tried,
i
believe
that
there
were
no
positives
which
were
shown
up
in
the
transferee
population.
since
that--
mr.
charles
fried
--well,
i
don't
think...
i
don't
think
records
were
kept--
mr.
charles
fried
--of
people
who
withdraw
and
in
fact
it's
rather
important
that
they
not
be
kept--
mr.
charles
fried
--because
the
withdrawal
process
is
one
which
is
quite
free.
mr.
charles
fried
that's
right,
or
people
who
simply
don't
apply.
since
the
time
the
case
was
tried,
there
have
been
a
small
number
of
persons
who
were
uncovered.
and
i
would
say
that
even
with--
mr.
charles
fried
--i
think
so.
what...
what
we
have
is
that...
that
two
internal
applicants
tested
positively
for
marijuana,
and
i
believe
ms.
williams
mentioned
that
there
were
five
instances
in
her
brief.
it's
a
very,
very
small
number.
i
don't
think
we
need
to
quarrel
about
what
the
exact
number
is.
it's
a
very
small
number,
but
it
is
not
zero.
and--
mr.
charles
fried
--i
think
about
somewhat
between
a
year
and
two
years,
mr.
chief
justice.
our
contention--
mr.
charles
fried
--i
think
that
you're
comparing,
with
respect,
apples
and
oranges
because
the
point
of
probable
cause
is
to
focus
and...
to
focus
and
to
confine
discretion.
in
this
case
there
is
no
need
to
confine
discretion
because
the
program
specifies
the
threshold
and
persons
voluntarily
approach
that
threshold.
mr.
charles
fried
the
probability
is
not
relevant
to
the...
i
have...
i
have--
mr.
charles
fried
--no.
my
point
is
that
if
it
has
any
chance
at
all...
and
i
think
it
does
have
a
chance...
of
deterring
applicants
and
catching
the
occasional
person,
that
is
sufficient
given
the
extreme
sensitivity
of
these
positions
and
given
the
need
to
assure
the
public
that
persons
who
are
engaged
in
drug
interception
have
been
willing
to
go
through
what
i
would
describe
as
a
kind
of
right
of
passage
to
indicate
that
they
know
and
that
the
service
knows
that
their
job
is
entirely
incompatible
with
any
involvement
with
drugs
whatsoever.
and
this
is
a
way
of
doing
that.
it
is
a
way
of--
mr.
charles
fried
--well,
of
course,
some
of
these
people--
mr.
charles
fried
--no,
we
do
not,
but
there
is--
mr.
charles
fried
--inquiry
made
into
those
things.
anybody
who
suffers
a
background
check...
there
are--
mr.
charles
fried
--it
is
i
think
a
normal
part
of
the
background
check
involved
in
a
transfer
to
a
sensitive
position,
if
you're
not
in
one
already,
is
to
ask
do
you
know...
and
you
will
ask
this
rather
widely
of
friends,
acquaintances,
families...
do
you
know
if
the
person
lives
beyond
their
means.
that's
a
standard
fbi
type
of
question
which
is
asked
of
many,
many
people
seeking
government--
mr.
charles
fried
--well,
we
think
that
it's
not
necessary
to
make
an
argument
about
whether
it's
a
search.
we're
prepared
to
concede
it's
a
search.
we
think
it's
pretty
much
on
the
border
of
a
search
and
no
search.
it's
a
very
marginal
kind
of
search.
mr.
charles
fried
not
any
kind
of
search,
not
of
their
desks,
not
of
their
homes,
no,
i
don't
think
we
have
that.
mr.
charles
fried
not
without
much
greater
threshold
circumstances
than
we
have
here.
it
is
an
important
part
of
our
argument
not
only
that
the
government's
need
is
an
important
one,
but
that
intrusion
is
minimal.
mr.
charles
fried
indeed.
mr.
charles
fried
yes,
it
is.
this
is
a
very
minimally--
mr.
charles
fried
--justice
scalia,
i
think,
was
saying
that
the
financial
search
which
he
and
i
and
you
also
undergo
regularly
is
far
more
intrusive.
this
is
much
less
intrusive.
this
is
much
less
intrusive,
and
being
much
less
intrusive,
requires
a
correspondingly
lesser
degree
of
urgent
necessity.
that...
that
is,
indeed,
our
contention.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
yes,
i
think
one
can
put
that
in
a
way
which
makes
it
seem
rather
showboating
and
insubstantial
or
something
which
is
very,
very
sensible.
i
think
there's
a
sensible
aspect
here
and
that
is
these
are
people
who
are
involved
personally
in
interception
of
drugs.
and
they
should,
therefore,
not
be
the
customers
of
the
very
illicit
trade
which
they
are
the
front
line
of
interdicting.
and
this
is
a
way
of
indicating
that
any
involvement,
not
just
the
day
before,
but
perhaps
up
to
60
days,
is
incompatible,
and
it's
really
one
of
the
most
secure
ways
of
showing
that
there
is
no
such
involvement.
mr.
charles
fried
the
three
categories
which
the
program
designates
are
persons
actually
involved
in
drug
interception,
persons
who
carry
or
use
firearms
and
persons
who
have
access
to
classified
information.
now,
it
may
be
that
certain
individuals
have
been
included
under
those
major
categories
improperly
or
who
shouldn't
have
been.
and
then
we
could
have
a
discussion
about
that,
and
that
would
be
a
basis
for
a
complaint
if
somebody
said
that,
look,
i...
i
carry
sealed
envelopes
and
i
shouldn't
be
included.
and
maybe
they
should
and
maybe
they
shouldn't.
mr.
charles
fried
the
challenge
has
not
been
litigated
at
all
on
the
basis
that
it's
a
little
bit
over-inclusive
here
and
might
have
been
a
little
bit
more...
more
inclusive
there.
so,
it
is
in
the
nature
of
a
facial
challenge.
as
we
consider
the
intrusion...
and
this
is
the
point
that
justice
stevens
was
concerned
about...
it
is
minimally
intrusive
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first,
the
very
fact
of
self-selection
makes
an
important
point
about
how
unintrusive
it
is.
you
choose
the
time
of
your
application.
you
are
given
advanced
warning,
and
if
you
find
this
offensive
or
threatening--
mr.
charles
fried
--it
would
apply
to
financial
searches
which
are
much
more
intrusive
and
much
more--
mr.
charles
fried
--well,
it's
much
less
intrusive
on
another
basis
and
that
is
that
these
are
persons
who
are
subject
to
a
large
number
of
other
background
checks
and--
mr.
charles
fried
--also
true
of
financial
searches.
and
also,
of
course,
it
is
a
search
which
is
akin
to
the
physical
examination,
which
justice
blackmun
was
talking
about.
so,
the
actual
process
of
collection
of
the
urine
is
hardly
something
which
people
are
not
familiar
with.
a
great
deal
was
made
about
the
humiliating
circumstances
of
the
collection
process,
and
i'd
like
to
say
something
about
that.
no
doubt
the
process
of
urination
is
something
which
has
a
customary
aura
of
privacy
in
our
society,
and
that's...
we
don't
quarrel
with
that.
we
don't
try
to
belittle
it.
in
fact,
the
hhs
regulations
under
which
this
and
all
employee
drug...
federal
employee
drug
testing
must
take
place
was
developed
as
a
result
of
a
rulemaking
procedure
in
which
these
very
concerns,
these
very
privacy,
dignitary
concerns
were
taken
into
account
and
there
was
an
adjustment.
judge
gezell
noted
in
a
case
involving
random
drug
testing
of
air
traffic
controllers
that
this
program
was
designed
to
somehow
accommodate
and
acknowledge
these
dignitary
concerns.
at
first
it
was
thought
that
the
collection
would
take
place
under
direct
observation,
and
as
a
result
of
hearing
exactly
the
kind
of
objections
which
ms.
williams
eloquently
put
forward,
the
government
stepped
back.
it
averted
its
eyes,
as
it
were,
and
said,
no,
there
will
not
be
direct
observation
unless
there's
some
reason
to
believe
that
something
unusual
is
going
on.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
very
stepping
back
is
exactly
the
kind
of
acknowledgement
that
there
is
a
privacy
concern
which
should
go
a
long
way
to
assuage
the
sense
that
something
unpleasant
is
going
on.
there...
you
go
into
a
stall,
and
that...
it's
an
area
which
is
designated
to
be
private.
now,
it's
not
the
most
private
thing
in
the
world,
but
it
is
more
private
than
it
might
have
been,
and
it
is
made
private.
there
is
a
kind
of
a
tip
of
the
hat
to
the
proposition
that,
look,
we
understand
this
might
be
embarrassing,
and
we're
trying
to
acknowledge
that.
and
that
goes
i
think
a
long
way
to
saying
we're
not
going
to
just
run
roughshod
over
you.
we
understand
this
is
disturbing
and
we
try
to
accommodate
to
that.
then
finally,
there
is
an
objection
to
the
search
of
the
specimen
itself.
we
see
in
the
briefs
the
phrase
that
this
is
a
periscope
into
the
private
lives
and
off-duty
behavior
of
the
employees.
now,
that's
a
striking
metaphor,
but
it's
both
misleading
and
fallacious.
the
tests
are
designed
to
come
up
with
only
one
thing:
evidence
of
controlled
substance
use.
it
will
not
show
any
other
kind
of
substances.
that's
the
first
thing.
second,
of
course,
many
of
those
substances
might
be
used
for
legitimate
purposes
under
a
doctor's
prescription,
for
instance.
that's
correct.
the
information
that
you
give
the
test
persons
about
that
is
something
which,
if
you...
if
you
wish,
you
may
withhold
until
the
time
that
you
meet
the
medical
review
officer,
and
you
may
at
that
time
say,
well,
it's
true.
it's
come
up
positive
for
opiates,
but
i
am
taking
cough
medicines
of
that
sort,
and
here's
the
doctor's
prescription.
and
that
information,
unless
the
mro
concludes
that
it's
not
true
or
that
you
are
a
drug
user...
that
information
stops
there
at
the
medical
review
officer's
desk.
it
does
not
get
to
the
agency.
and
therefore,
this
periscope
is
designed
to
allow
the
employer
to
see
only
one
thing:
illegal
drug
use.
and
we
suggest
that
the
employer
is
entitled
to
inquire
into
that.
they
inquire
of
the
person
under
penalties
of
perjury,
of
his
neighbors,
of
his
family,
and
we
think
may
also
inquire
of
a
urine
sample.
mr.
charles
fried
we
do
not
take
the
position
that
it
may
do
so
for
all
its
employees
because
we
don't
have
that
case
before
us.
we
think
it's
very
important
that
the
court--
mr.
charles
fried
--that
is
an
element
of
our
argument.
it
is
not
by
any
means
the
whole
of
our
argument.
i
think
it's
terribly--
mr.
charles
fried
--it
certainly
should
be
a
concern.
we
have
essentially
three
kinds
of
drug
testing
programs.
there's
a
drug
testing
program
which
is
triggered
by
an
alarming
incident
or
some
kind
of
suspicion,
and
you've
just
had
a
case
on
that
argued
to
you.
we
have
threshold
drug
testing
programs,
and
that's
what
this
is,
where
a
person
freely...
i
won't
use
the
word
"voluntarily"
because
that's
legally
freighted...
freely
comes
up
to
a
threshold,
applies
for
a
job,
applies
for
a...
for
a
promotion.
that's
this
case.
and
then
there's
the
random
kind
of
testing,
and
that
case
is
not
before
you.
we
think
it's
very
important
that,
though
inevitably
you
will
deal
in
categories
of
cases,
that
the
court
consider
the
kind
of
case
that
it
actually
has
with
the
kind
of
record
and
the
kind
of
justification
that
is
present.
if
we
have
a
case
in
which
a
much
larger
population
is
tested
or
where
the
method
is
random
drug
testing,
then
i
would
hope
the
court
will
consider
that
case
on
the
record
that
will
then
be
established
after
it
has
been
sorted
over
and
digested
by
courts
below.
but
we
ask
neither
that
we
get
a
hint
or
a
signal
helping
us
out
in
those
cases,
but
we
hope
that
nothing
will
be
said
to
preclude
them
either.
that
really
lies
in
the
future.
no
doubt
both
the
customs
service
and
the
department
of
transportation
are
contemplating
much
more
extensive
programs.
and
those
programs
will
have
to
await
the
day
of
review
in
the
department
of
justice
and
review
in
the
lower
courts.
i
would
hope
that
the
court
will
consider
this
case
with
this
case's
justification
and
its
rather
special
and
urgent
and
frankly
symbolic
significance
because
we
are
here
dealing
with
the
borders
across
which
these
drugs
must
come.
mr.
charles
fried
yes,
it
is.
mr.
charles
fried
there
was
no
consideration
of
blood
testing,
and
one
reason
is
that
the
urine
test
is
really
pretty
good
in
showing
not
current
impairment
because
current
impairment
is
not
our
focus.
our
focus
is
any
involvement
with
drugs
at
all.
we
do
not
accept
the
notion--
mr.
charles
fried
--yes,
it...
it's
curious.
sometimes
we're
told
that
that
fact
means
this
is
a
bad
program
and
sometimes
we're
told
that
this
is
a
good
program.
mr.
charles
fried
absolutely,
yes,
because
the
urine
testing
will
show
that
this
person
does
use
drugs.
and
we
think
the
drugs
are
both
used
surreptitiously,
which
is
why
people
who
use
them
may
escape
notice
or
observation,
but
it's
also
insidious.
and
people
who
used
drugs
on
one
occasion
are...
may
be
inclined
to
use
them
on
other
occasions,
and
we
think
that
a
60
day
horizon
is
a
good
thing.
it
catches
people.
we
think
that's
excellent.
and
if
it
deters
some
people
from
applying,
that's
good
too.
we
don't
think
that's
a
bad
result.
that's
a
good
result.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
charles
fried
--what
i
meant
by
that
is
that
the
customs
service
is,
indeed,
entitled
to
take
a
very
fine
filter,
which
this
is,
to
show
to
itself,
to
its
employees
and
to
the
public
that
persons
who
will
be
in...
who
will
be
on
the
border
across
which
these
drugs
come
are
persons
who,
as
far
as
we
can
tell,
are
not
themselves
involved
in
drugs.
we
don't
do
everything,
but
here
is
a
simple,
nonintrusive,
rather
familiar
kind
of
step
that's
taken
which
gives
some
measure
of
assurance.
of
course,
other
things,
but
they
are
more
draconic,
would
give
greater
assurance.
it
is
a
balance.
it's
not
very
intrusive,
and
it
gives
a
fair
measure
of
assurance.
mr.
charles
fried
well...
and,
of
course,
higher
level
employees
must
give
that
financial
information
and
financial
disclosure
forms.
they
don't
consent
to
a
search
of
their
home,
but
we
think
that's
much
more
intrusive.
so,
the...
the
degree
of
the
intrusion
is
an
important
element
in
the
balance.
i
don't
try
to--
mr.
charles
fried
--oh,
it
would
support
it--
mr.
charles
fried
--if
the
other
factors
were--
mr.
charles
fried
--present,
if
the
symbol
were
important,
if
the
filter
was
effective,
which
we
think
it
is,
and
if
it
was
as
minimally
intrusive
as
this
one
is
and,
of
course,
with
the
very
important
element
that
you
present
yourself
for
this
test,
you
volunteer
for
these
positions.
i'm
not
saying
this
is
consensual,
but
you
do
volunteer
for
these
positions,
and
you
may
withdraw
your
application
any
time
prior
to
the
test.
put
all
of
that
together,
and
i
think
we
have
something
which
is
imminently
reasonable.
i
thank
the
court.
