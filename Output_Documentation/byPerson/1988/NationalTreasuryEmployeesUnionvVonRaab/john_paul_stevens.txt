justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
this
case
just
involves
people
who
are
being
transferred
and
promoted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
your
argument
rests
very
heavily
on
the
past
history
of
these
people.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
take
it
your
argument
really
would
not
apply
to
initial
applicants
for
employment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--do
you
think
the
government
would
have
a
stronger
case
as
to
applicants
than
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general,
may
i
ask
this
question?
is
one
element
in
the
balance
the
probability
that
some
useful
information
will
be
discovered?
when
we
talk
in...
in
the
normal
warrant
case
probable
cause
to
find
something
or...
is
that
an
element
in
the
balance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general,
may
i
interrupt
because
i
don't
think
we
should
talk
about
applicants.
we're
talking
about
a
group
of
people
who
have
a
track
record.
and
as
your
brief
points
out,
they
have
a
50
to
67
percent
capacity
under
drugs
and
they
have
absenteeism
and
all
the
rest
of
it.
and
they
don't
have
it...
they
have
a
track
record
of
not
disclosing
that
kind
of
behavior.
so,
isn't
it
fair
to
presume
that
there
is
very...
that
the
incidence
of
drug
use
among
the
people
that
are
going
to
be
tested
is
very,
very
small?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
your
tests
show
it
to
be
nonexistent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
among...
among
transferees?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
first
interrupt
and
ask
you.
as
to
what
was
in
the
record
at
the
time
the
case
was
tried,
it
was
nonexistent,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
again,
let
me
just...
let
me
just...
so
you
have
time
to
address
it.
if
in
the
probable
cause
situation
we
think
there
ought
to
be
maybe
a
35,
40,
50
percent
chance
that
the
warrant
will
produce
incriminating
evidence
and
you
have
a
test
of
two
people
out
of
a
couple
of
thousand
or
whatever
it
is,
is
that
a
sufficient
probability
you
think
to
be
reasonable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
are
you
saying
then
that
the
probability
of
finding
something
is
not
relevant
to
the
analysis?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
isn't
what
you
said
earlier.
that's
why--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--are
they
compelled
to
file
financial
disclosure
statements
such
as
justice
scalia
suggested?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
do
you
regularly
look
at
their
bank
accounts
and
find
out
what
their
financial
status
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
i'm
talking
about
after
they're
on
the
job
and
when
they
apply
for
a
transfer
or
promotion.
i
would
think
an
elementary
thing
you'd
want
to
know
if
they're
susceptible
to
bribery
is
what
their
financial
condition
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
you
conduct
any
searches
to
find
that
information?
this
is
a
search.
i
guess
everybody
agrees
to
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
put
it
differently.
do
you
think
you
have
the
right
to
make
a
search
to
find
out
about
the
financial
information
of
all
your...
your
agents?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
your
argument
then
is
that
the
intrusiveness
of
this
search
is
much
less
than
the
intrusiveness
of
a
search
that
would
reveal
financial
information.
that's
what
you're
arguing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
i
might
point
out
is
the
exact
opposite
of
the
position
justice
scalia
suggested
earlier.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but,
mr.
solicitor
general,
that
argument
would
apply
to
financial
searches
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why...
why
is...
you
were
going
to
explain
why
this
is
less
intrusive
than
a
financial
search
and
give...
give
me
an
argument
that
would
apply
equally
to
both.
justice
john
paul
stevens
also
true
with
respect
to
financial
searches.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
one
more,
if
i
may.
you
said
this
case
has
symbolic
significance.
what
did
you
mean
by
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
symbolic
assurance
would
be
precisely
the
same
for
searches
for
financial
information
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but...
but
the
symbol
that
you
seek
would
really
support
a
very
wide
range
of
investigative
activity.
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
the
extent
that
you
rely
on
that
argument.
