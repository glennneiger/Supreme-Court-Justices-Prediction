do
you
think
that
a
periodic
physical
inspection,
including
urine
and
blood
tests
for
employees,
for
example,
engineers
of
trains
or
pilots
of
airplanes,
is
not
a
reasonable
requirement
on
an
ongoing
basis?
justice
sandra

o'connor
well,
isn't
the
government's
argument
here
that
these
are
in
a
sense
safety-connected
jobs
at
stake
in
the
customs
service.
people
who
are
out
there
in
the
field
trying
to
stop
the
flow
of
drugs
into
this
country,
for
example...
should
they
not...
is
there
no
heightened
concern
for
those
employees
that
they
also
be
drug-free,
not
users
or
abusers
of
drugs
themselves?

justice
sandra

o'connor
well,
do
you
think
it's
unreasonable
for
the
government
to
rely
on
statistics
generally
for
all
employees
to
the
extent
of
drug
use
to...
to
develop
its
concern
within
this
particular
agency?
justice
sandra

o'connor
well,
mr.
fried,
i
guess
this
program
though
extends
to
employees
other
than
those
on
the
front
lines
of
drug
interdiction,
for
example,
in
the
classified
information
area.
apparently
it
extends
even
to
messengers
and
food
service
workers.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
this
purely
a
facial
challenge
so
that
we
leave
room
for
those
degrees
of
difference--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
fried,
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
government
can
do
that
for
all
its
employees
or
only
those
in
certain,
select
categories?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
to
the
extent
that
you
rely
on
efficiency
of
government
operations
as
a
rationale,
it
would
certainly
extend,
it
seems
to
me,
to
everyone.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
should
be
a
concern
for
us,
should
it
not?
