ms.
lois
g.
williams
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
customs
program
at
issue
today,
large
numbers
of
innocent
people
are
subjected
to
what
they
regard
as
a
degrading
and
embarrassing
search
of
their
urine
when
the
government
has
no
reason
to
believe
that
they
are
guilty
of
any
drug
use
and
when
the
government
admits
that
it
does
not
expect
to
find
significant
evidence
of
such
misconduct
in
these
searches.
we
will
argue,
therefore,
that
these
suspicionless
searches
are
unreasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment.
i'd
like
to
consider
first
today
the
government's
justification
for
this
search
because
under
any
analysis
the
court
may
employ,
the
government
must
have
a
need
to
intrude
upon
the
privacy
of
its
citizens,
even
its
employees.
and
if
that
need
does
not
exist,
if
it
is
not...
if
the
search
is
not
justified,
even
a
minor
intrusion
cannot
be
justified.
therefore,
the...
the
government
argues
that
this
is
a
minor
intrusion.
i
would
like
to...
to
address
the
intrusion
question
second.
now,
the
government
recites
an
interest
in
this
case
in
a
drug-free
work
force.
but
on
this
record,
as
we
will
show,
that
interest
is
already
met
and
it
is
not
threatened.
and
in
that
event,
the
government
has
failed
to
establish
any
need
to
undertake
new
and
intrusive
searches
beyond
the
many
tools
it
already
possesses,
let
alone
searches
without
any
individualized
suspicion
whatever.
may
i
turn
then
to
what
the
record
actually
shows
about
the
origins
of
this
program?
ms.
lois
g.
williams
well,
your
honor--
ms.
lois
g.
williams
--we
have...
we
have...
the
government
has
never
really
made
an
argument
that
it
should
be
freed
of
the
traditional
requirements
of
the
fourth
amendment.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
i...
we
have...
we
did
preserve
that
argument,
your
honor.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
but
we
are
not...
we
do
not
believe
that
the
court
would
require
a
warrant
in
this
circumstance.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
but--
ms.
lois
g.
williams
--well,
let
me
suggest
i...
i
really
believe
that
this...
these
searches
ought
to
be
conducted
only
on
probable
cause.
the...
i
am
perfectly
willing
to...
to
see
that
the
warrant
requirement
is
a...
is
a
bit
different.
and
i...
although
i
think...
and
that's
because
in
a
suspicion
circumstance,
we
have
a
more
imminent
situation.
in
this
situation,
however,
we
have
people
who
have
done
nothing.
there
is
no
triggering
event
of
any
sort
which
would
suggest
that
a
warrant
requirement
could
be
abandoned.
i
mean,
usually
it's
justified
in
abandoning
the
warrant
requirement
when
there
are
some
sort
of
exigencies.
and
when
you
are
looking
at
people
who
have
given
you
no
cause
at
all,
it
is
rather
more
like
the
situation
where
at
least
some
sort
of
area-wide
warrant
or
work
force-wide
warrant
might
be
obtained.
i
frankly
believe
that
that
is
less--
ms.
lois
g.
williams
--far
less
important
than
the...
than
the
requirement
of
cause.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
your
honor,
it...
it...
i
am
perfectly
satisfied
that
the...
the
warrant
would
give
very
little
more
than
we
already
have,
which
is
why
we
don't
place
great
stock
in
it.
but
the
analysis
to
be
sound...
true
to
the
analysis,
normally
the
government
would
have
to
justify
abandoning
the
traditional
requirements.
it
hasn't
really
made
that
argument
in
this
case.
but
the
regularity
of
the
procedure
is
not
really
the
problem
in
this
case.
the
problem
is
in
taking
people
who
have
done
nothing
for
which
they
can
be
criticized.
indeed,
the
selection
of
this
group
is
almost
perverse
because
they
have
recently
been
examined
and
their
work
record
evaluated.
they
are
current
employees,
many
with
long
histories,
who
have
been
selected
for
promotion.
it...
they
would
appear
to
be
on
common
sense
the
least
likely
to
create
any
problem
for
the
customs
service.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
no.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
well,
it
is
true,
indeed,
your
honor,
that
there
are
many
invasions
of
privacy
that
we
suffer.
but
i
take
it
even
a
federal
judge,
who
is
subjected
to
the
most
rigorous
scrutiny
and
who
discloses...
who
permits
disclosure
of
financial
records
and
even
medical
records
and
the
like,
might
well
object
if
it...
if
it
were
announced
that
his
home
should
be
subject
to
search
or
that
his
desk
perhaps
should
be
subject
to
search.
this
is
a
search.
that's
the
difference.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
that's
right.
that's
why
i
would
not
make
that
argument.
[laughter]
ms.
lois
g.
williams
it
is...
there
are--
ms.
lois
g.
williams
--no,
there
are--
[laughter]
there
are
very...
there
are
many
very
substantial
intrusions
that
are
not
searches
within
the
fourth
amendment.
we
do
suffer
those,
and
i
think
in
the...
the
problem
in
the
employment
context
is
perhaps
we
feel
that
we
have
opened
ourselves
to
practically
every
question,
and
we
have
practically
no
privacy
left
when
we're
applying
for
a
promotion
in
a
job,
let
us
say.
but
that's
not
so
because
all
of
us
would
draw
lines
at
being
personally
searched
even
though
we...
we
do
permit
vast
disclosures
of
our
private
information.
that
personal
search
is
what
distinguishes
this
from
the
many
other
privacy
invasions
involved.
and
let
me
say
that
when
those
other
areas
of
privacy
are
yielded
up,
there
is
even
less
justification
for
the
search
of
this
sort
because
we
have
disclosed,
in
fact,
so
much.
do...
does
society
really
require
this
further
indignity
that
is
wrought
upon
us?
i
think
the
justification
decreases
in
that
situation
rather
than
saying,
well,
we've...
we've...
we've
let
our
privacy
go.
we
have
no
expectation
left.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
yes.
i
think
it
may
be
a
reasonable
requirement
in...
in
the
right
sort
of
safety-connected
jobs.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
there
is
a
heightened
concern,
and
i
think
these
are
the
kind
of
employees
for
which
we
might
ask
is...
is
probable
cause
required
or
might
we
do
some
kinds
of
searches
on
reasonable
suspicion.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
but
let
me...
but
let
me
say
that
in
a
situation
like
this
where
we
have
a
200-year
old
agency
and
no
incident
in
this
record...
none...
no
study
is
ever
done.
there
is
not
a
single
incident
of...
of
a
safety
problem,
a
bribery
or
integrity
problem
owing
to
employee
drug
use
in
that
entire
history.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
yes,
i
do,
your
honor,
for
several
reasons.
one,
there...
i
have...
i
have
searched.
it
is
very
difficult
to
find
reliable
statistics
about
work
places
in
general,
number
one.
number
two,
we
have
a
work
force
here
about
whom
we
know
a
great
deal.
and
i
think--
ms.
lois
g.
williams
--it
is--
ms.
lois
g.
williams
--we
have...
the
record...
the
record
in
the
case
shows
that
at
the
time
the
case
was
decided
in
the
court
of
appeals,
there
were
approximately
1,000
persons
tested.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
had
been
tested,
not--
ms.
lois
g.
williams
--no...
no
employee
tested
positive.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
right.
since
then
on
the
public
record
last
spring,
the
commissioner
in
testimony
to
congress
stated
that
some
3,600
tests
had
been
done
and
five
persons
tested
positive.
we
do
not
know
whether
any
of
those
were
current
employees
or
not.
and
we...
we
have
before
us
the
current
employees.
so,
we...
we
know
at
most
it
was...
it
was
five
persons
out
of
3,600.
i
have
no
information
about
what
has
been
done
since.
but
i
would
say
with
the
size
of
the
customs
service,
even
if
you
assumed
that
every
single
one
of
those
was
a
current
employee
and
we
tested
everybody
next
week,
that
would...
that
would
yield
20
or
21
positives
out
of
a...
a
work
force
of
14,000
to
15,000.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
yes.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
we
do
not
know
that.
but
we
have,
as
i
say--
ms.
lois
g.
williams
--yes.
but...
but
let's
look
at
that
question
of
deterrence.
when...
it's
very
difficult
to
evaluate
that
when
we've
had
no
problem
that
we
know
of
ever.
so,
when
we
talk
about
deterrence
as
a
feature
of
the
government's
argument,
i
think
it's
very
easy
to
say...
and
it's
impossible
to
evaluate.
one
can't
really
speak
meaningfully
of
deterring
a
non-problem.
first
of
all,
the
tests
would
have
to
be
highly
effective
i
think
to
serve
as
an
effective
deterrent.
and
as
we've
argued
in
our
brief,
this
particular
test
is
unusually
ineffective
since
it's
given
one
time
and
on...
on
several
days'
notice.
but
in
any
event,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
would
help
us
evaluate
the
deterrent
effect
and
note
the...
the
argument
that
the
government
makes
allows
it
to
claim
success
either
way.
if
we
catch
any
people,
this
test
is
working;
and
if
don't
catch
any
people,
the
test
is
working.
that...
that
defies
common
sense.
compare
it
with
the
magnetometer
searches
which
have
been
the
subject
of
litigation.
that
search,
far
less
intrusive
than
this
one
i
trust
by
anyone's
measure
has...
we...
there
is...
there
was
clearly
something
going
on
that
needed
to
be
deterred.
there
was
a
problem.
it
was
a...
it
was
a
terrible
problem.
and
we
knew
it,
and
we
could
see
it,
and
we
could
measure
it.
and
when
magnetometers
were
instituted
all
around
the
country,
we
no
longer
had
to
think
when
we
got
on
an
airplane
am
i
going
to
end
up
in
cuba
at
this
time.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
no.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
it
could
anticipate
it,
but
it
has
to
be
a
reasonable
anticipation.
this
agency
has...
it's
very
clear
that...
that
it
has
many
tools
to
see
whether
it
has
the
kind
of
problem
it
purports
to
look
for.
it
has
a
very
aggressive
internal
affairs
division
whose
sole
reason
for
being
is
to
investigate
the
conduct
of
its
employees
and
it
does
that
with
a
vengeance.
and
it
never
has
turned
up
any
of
the
kinds
of
problems
that
the
commissioner
refers
to
related
to
employee
drug
abuse.
moreover,
the
commissioner
himself
said
drug
abuse
would
create
these
problems
in
the
work
force.
and
he
points
to
things
like
theft,
health
insurance,
accidents,
lowered
productivity,
morale
problems
though
every
one
of
those
is
a
visible
manifestation.
you
can
look
at
the
work
force
and
you
can
see
whether
you
have
those
sorts
of
problems.
and
you
can
perhaps
use
those
as
the
basis
for
individualized
suspicion.
i
suggest
the
analysis
this
court
employed
in
delaware
v.
prouse
is
very
appropriate
here
when
it...
when
it
inquired
into
the
effectiveness
of
the...
of
the
search
in
service
of
the
stated
goal.
and
what
the
court
said
is
it
does...
it
is
not
necessarily
a
matter
of
common
sense
that
we
will
catch
more
people
if
we
just
set
out
to
do
it
without
any
suspicion.
isn't
it
far
more
sensible,
in
fact,
to
look
for
the
manifestations,
to...
to...
to
see
what
kinds
of
problems
you
have
bearing
in
mind
that
none
has
emerged?
it's
inconceivable
that
there
should
have
been
some
kind
of
significant
problem
before
that...
that
has
never
surfaced.
but
look
for
those
kinds
of
infractions...
in
delaware
v.
prouse,
it
was
traffic
infractions;
here
any
kind
of
work
place
infractions...
and
use
those
as
the
basis
for
individualized
suspicion.
in
that
event,
i
suggest...
and
the
record
i...
i
think
there
is
not
a
suggestion
in
this
record
to
the
contrary...
that
that
would
be
a
far
more
effective
way
to
search
out
whether,
in
fact,
there
is
anyone
in
this
work
force
to
be
concerned
about.
there
is...
the
deterrence
rationale
seems
to
me
to
go
to
the
heart
of
what
the
fourth
amendment
is
all
about.
and
if
deterrence
alone
is
enough
to
justify
dragnet
searching
of
innocent
people,
i
do
not
see
any
principled
way
that
lines
can
begin
to
be
drawn
after
that.
now,
perhaps
if
we
are
talking
about
dramatic
public
safety
concerns,
that
is
a
place
where
we
would
want
to
draw
a
line.
but
the
further
we
get
from
that
into
areas
of
integrity
and
responsibility--
ms.
lois
g.
williams
--well,
that's
an
interesting
question--
ms.
lois
g.
williams
--your
honor.
we
can
only
speculate.
obviously
there
is
a
reason
why
they
need
to
be
concerned
about
drug
abuse
among
their
employees,
and
we
have
never
suggested
to
the
contrary.
but
the...
but
the
fourth
amendment
question
is
one
of--
ms.
lois
g.
williams
--yes,
of
course,
it
does.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
and
that...
that
question...
even
if
the...
the
rationale
is
these
employees
need
to
be
above
suspicion,
i
do
not
disagree
with
that
point.
they
are
in
a
position
where
they
are...
they
have
a
very
sensitive
responsibility
that
has
to
do
with
drugs.
but--
ms.
lois
g.
williams
--they
have
discovered
such.
they
have
very
effective
investigations
that
do
turn
those
up--
ms.
lois
g.
williams
--but
never
connected
with
drug
abuse
on
the
part
of
the
employee.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
never
yet.
and
that...
that
is
the
critical
link
that's
missing
here.
people
are
subjected
to
bribery
all
the
time
and
integrity
violations
are
of
great
concern.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
well,
they
may...
they
may
be--
ms.
lois
g.
williams
--they're
not,
your
honor.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
that's
true,
but
i
mean,
i
think
that
stands
to
reason.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
it
is
not
beyond
imagination.
that's
right.
but
it
is...
it
is...
it
is
a
little
further
removed
from...
from--
ms.
lois
g.
williams
--but
what
might
subject
a
person
to
a
bribe
are
vast
numbers
of
things,
your
honor.
and
i
take
it
we
would
say...
we
would...
we
would
say
the
fact
that
someone
might
be
subjected
to
a
bribe
because
he
is
in
financial
difficulty
is
our
justification
for
now
searching
desks,
searching
homes,
tapping
phones.
i...
i
think
that
the
difficulty
is
that...
that
a
possible
drug
use
does
not
subject
one
to
a
bribe
any
more
than
any
number
of
other
things
that
we
might
think
of
and
that
those
things
we
have
always
understood
must
be
demonstrated
to
be
suspicious
in
order
to
justify
those
kinds
of
searches.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
i--
ms.
lois
g.
williams
--i
say
that
i
understand
the
goal
that
they
want
their
employees
to
be...
to
have
integrity
and
to
be
seen
as
such.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
commissioner
said
when
he
promulgated...
he
just
decided
to
do
this.
he
just
announced
it.
there
was
never
any
study--
ms.
lois
g.
williams
--i
can
tell
you,
your
honor,
it
is
not
in
the
record.
it
is
not,
but
it
is
a
matter
probably
that
could
be
compiled
from
public
records.
we
know
that
one-third
of
the
customs
service's
customs
inspectors...
they
are
covered.
that
would
be
5,000.
we
know
that
virtually
every
manager
is
covered.
it
is
my
information
that...
that
probably
at
least
three-quarters
of
the
customs
service
occupy
covered
positions
now.
that...
that
is
a
matter
of
putting
together
a
number
of
records.
it
is
clear
to
us
that
the
justification...
the...
the
catchall
justification
really...
and
virtually
all
of
the
employees
in
the
customs
service
are
categorized
as
critical-sensitive,
which
means
that...
that
the
justification
could
apply
to
virtually
all
of
them.
it
has
not
yet
been
so
applied.
but
that...
the
catchall
category
is
access
to
confidential
information
by
which
is
meant
sensitive
and...
and
delicate,
but
not
necessarily
of
a
top
secret
classification
which
i
think
is
important
not
to
confuse
those
two.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
yes,
he
did,
your
honor.
he...
he...
not...
not--
ms.
lois
g.
williams
--no,
not
so
far
as
this
record
shows
and
it
did
precede
the
executive
order
that
the
president
issued.
the...
the...
this
program
preceded
it.
he...
the
commissioner...
not
only
did
he
not
know
of
any
problem
in
his
work
force,
he
didn't
look...
he
did
not
study
to
see
whether
there
was
any.
he
sought
no
one's
advice
as
far
as
we
know,
and
made
no
judgment
that
is
anywhere
on
this
record
that
said
that
it
is
necessary
to
do
these
searches
without
probable
cause,
without
individualized
suspicion.
he
simply
announced
that
he
was
going
to
do
it.
he
announced
that
he
might
do
it,
and
then
a
little
later
he
announced
that,
in
fact,
he
was
going
to
do
it.
and
he
acknowledged,
when
he
made
that
announcement,
that
the
customs
employees
were
known
for
their
integrity
in
the
law
enforcement
community.
and
he
announced
that
drug
use
in
the
agency
was
not
the
reason
for
this
program.
he
did
not
expect
to
find
a
significant
problem
and,
indeed,
he
has
not
found
a
significant
problem.
so,
why
would
he
do
it?
his
announced
reasons
were
two:
to
set
an
important
example
in
the
country's
struggle
against
drugs,
and
to
show
the
entire
work
force
the
drug
screening
is
a
good
thing
in
that
struggle.
but
it
seems
to
us
quite
clear
that
the
goals
recited
in
the
government's
brief,
safe
and
efficient
operation,
promoting
the
integrity
of
the
service,
preserving
the
agency's
reputation,
are
fine
goals.
they
simply
were
never
in
jeopardy
here.
and...
and
ironically,
the
commissioner
may
have
placed
them
more
in
jeopardy
when
he
suggested
that
now,
although
there's
no
problem,
we're
going
to
start
testing.
now,
because
these
goals
were
not
threatened
and
because
they
were
not
addressed
by
this
program
at
all
except
in
some
very
attenuated
way...
we
want
to
prevent
these
things
from
ever
arising...
we
do
not
see
how
they
can
justify
the
searches...
searches
that
are
intrusive
of...
of
innocent
persons.
and
i'd
like
to
spend
a
moment,
if
i
can,
talking
about
the
nature
of
the
intrusion
here
because
i
think
it
is
very
easy--
ms.
lois
g.
williams
--surely.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
yes.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
yes.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
i
think...
we
do
not
argue
for
initial
applicants.
i
believe
the
balance
is
somewhat
different
in
that
circumstance,
and
whereas
i
do
believe
that...
that
individuals
applying
for
jobs
have
significant
privacy
rights,
the
government
has
less
means
to
evaluate
them
perhaps
than
it
does...
certainly
than
it
does
current
employees.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
so,
whether
or
not
that
could
be
justified,
it
is
a...
a
different
balance,
a
little
different
balance.
and
i
think--
ms.
lois
g.
williams
--i
think
it
would
have
somewhat
stronger
case,
yes.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
to
some...
oh,
inspectors
do
have
to
have
what
is
called
a
medical
certification.
many
of
the
people
covered
do
not
have
medical
exams.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
what
they
do
is
they
have
a...
a
form,
a
one-page
form,
they
take
to
their
doctor
with
things
circled
that...
that
say
these
are
the
requirements
for
the
job.
and
the
doctor,
one's
own
doctor,
signs
that...
that
requisite--
ms.
lois
g.
williams
--no,
not...
it
is...
there
is
no
test
done
for
that.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
no,
no,
not...
not...
no,
not
for
that.
and
if
urinalysis
is
required...
it
is
in
some...
it
is
not...
a
drug
screen
is
not
done.
the...
the
nature
of
the
intrusion
in
this
case
is
we
think
twofold.
it...
it
has
to
do
with
both
the
process
of
collecting
the
sample,
which
we
have
outlined
in
our
brief,
and
with
the...
the
laboratory
analysis
itself.
and
recalling
that
these
are
good
employees,
they...
they
must
report
to
what
we
have
come
to
call
a
collection
site
to
give
a
urine
sample
in
a
highly
controlled
atmosphere
closely
monitored
by
a
collection
site
person
who
has
no
training
or
experience
in
particular
whose
sole
purpose
is
to
prevent
cheating
and
to
preserve
the
chain
of
custody.
usually
the
employee
is
not
directly
watched
while
urinating,
but
he
may
be
under
certain
circumstances.
but
he
must
be
closely
listened
to
and
in
all
other
ways
closely
observed
for
signs
of
unusual
or
suspicious
behavior
which
is
noted
in
a
permanent
book.
the
sample
is
then
sent
to
a
laboratory
for
analysis
to
detect
the
presence
of
drugs.
and
i
have
to
mention
that
every
single
one
of
these
specified
drugs
but
one
has
licit
uses
as
well
as
illicit.
every
single
one
but
one.
and
all
of
those
legitimate
therapeutic
uses
will
have...
will
be
discovered
by
this
test
and
will
have
to
be
justified
to
a
representative
of
the
employer.
so,
those
employees
who
take
medication
for
certain
kinds
of
pain,
certain
kinds
of
depression,
narcolepsy,
inflammatory
bowel
disease,
chronic
cough,
maybe
even
some
cancer
treatments,
will
have
to
justify
their
use
of
these
drugs.
now,
the
fourth
amendment
protects
various
interests,
among
them
privacy,
bodily
integrity
and
dignity.
and
i
think
each
of
those
is
seriously
transgressed
by
this
test.
it
is
a
personal
search
of
the
contents
of
one's
bladder.
it
is
taken
under
demeaning
conditions.
it
involves
a
very
sheltered
and
private
function
of
our
person,
something
many
people
go
to
great
lengths
to
avoid
attracting
any
attention
to
whatever.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
no,
indeed,
your
honor.
it's
the...
it's
the
highly
controlled
and
observed
circumstances
that
is...
that
are
particularly
demeaning
in
this
case.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
yes,
indeed,
your
honor.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
no,
but
nobody
came
into
the
toilet
with
me
to
watch
to
see
whether
this,
indeed,
was
my
urine.
that
is
what's
demeaning
about
this
particular
test.
the...
the
intrusion
on
various
aspects
of
one's
privacy
that
is
wrought
by
this
test
far
exceeds
i
think
because
of
those...
those
demeaning
features.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
well,
i
think
my
clients,
your
honor,
who
are
standing
before
this
collection
site
do
not
confuse
what
they
are
about
to
do
with
a
visit
to
the
doctor.
it
is
not
the
same.
the
atmosphere
is
an
adversarial,
punitive
atmosphere.
it
is
not
a
trusting,
confidential
one
that
we
have
come
to
expect
in
a
visit
to
the
doctor
which
is
the
most
these
employees
would
ever
have
to
do
for
their
employer
in
a
fairly
limited
way.
i'd
like
to
save
a
moment,
if
i
can,
for
rebuttal.
ms.
lois
g.
williams
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
with
that
time,
i
would
like
to
make
just
a
couple
of
points.
these
employees...
the
bulk
of
them
are...
do
very
important
jobs,
but
customs
inspectors
are
gs-5,
7
and
9.
they
are
hardly
to
be
compared
with
the...
the
jobs
that
carry
the
greatest
responsibility
in
government.
it's
responsible,
but
as
your
honor's
question
points
out,
it
is
very
hard
then
to
see
where
it
would
end.
i
would
like
to...
to
say
that
this
is
one
search
where
innocent
persons
have
a
great
deal
of
reason
to
be
apprehensive.
and
it
is
notice
that
what
they...
what
they
are
going
to
do
does
not
really
cure
that
problem.
will
i
be
able
to
do
what
is
required
of
me
at
this
test,
how
will
i
feel
about
it,
what
if
a
mistake
is
made,
are
entirely
reasonable
apprehensions
that
everyone
facing
this
test
must
have.
now,
i
would
like
to
say
in
closing
that,
of
course,
the
employer
is
entitled
to
inquire
about
all
sorts
of
things
when
one
applies
for
this
kind
of
job.
the
question
is
saying
that
i
have
an
interest
in
whether
or
not
you
ever
used
drugs...
does
that
give
me
the
right
to
conduct
searches
to
find
out
whether
you
are
telling
me
the
truth?
and
one
of
the
most
unsettling
arguments
the
government
makes
is
we
can
take
no
risk.
we
can
take
no
risk
at
all.
the
margin
for
error
built
into
an
individualized
suspicion
requirement
is
unacceptable
in...
in
the
situation
we
have
here.
the
margin
of
error
is
unacceptable
or
singularly
unsuited,
as
i
believe
the
brief
says.
but
that
is
a
judgment
we
are
not
free
to
make
today.
we
are
no...
we
cannot
say
that
we
can
no
longer
afford
the
margin
of
error
that
is
built
into
the
fourth
amendment.
