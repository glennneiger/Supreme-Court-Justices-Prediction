you
say
that

his
own?
justice

jr.
he
didn't
have
to
get
the
approval
of
any
agency
or
otherwise?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
you
do
that,
may
i
ask
just
one
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
that...
would
those
be
the
figures
that
ms.
williams
gave
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor
general,
this...
this
program
is
limited
to
urine
testing,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
any
consideration
of
blood
testing
and
any
reason
for
not
including
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
urine
testing
may
disclose
something...
consumption
as
recently
as
back
as
60
days.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
was
that
fact
one
of
the
reasons
that...
for
the
choice
of
urine
testing?
