it
seems
to
me,
therefore,
you
say
the
government
has
an
unattainable
goal.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
us
a
little
bit
about
the
three
categories?
it's...
it's
not
quite
clear
to
me
the
percentage
of
customs
employees
that
are
covered
in
the
three
categories.
there
are
those
who
carry
arms,
those
who
are
involved
in
the
interdiction
of
drugs,
and
those
who
have
access
to
classified
material.
is
that...
can
you
tell
me
what
percentage
of
the
customs
force
that
is?
justice
anthony

are
you
saying,
general
fried,
that
one
of
the
principal
interests
the
government
has
here
is
to
vindicate
the
idea
and
the
image
of
an
elite
corps
within
the
government?

second
of
these
two
cases
is
national
treasury
employees
union
versus
van
raab.
here,
the
facts
are
considerably
different.
the
united
states
custom
service,
whose
primary
task
is
to
interdict
and
seize
illegal
drugs
that
are
smuggled
into
this
country,
has
implemented
a
drug
testing
program
which
applies
to
all
employees
seeking
transfer
or
promotion
to
three
kinds
of
jobs.
those
directly
involved
in
drug
interdiction,
those
requiring
the
handling
of
firearms,
and
those
who
are
the
employee
would
be
handling
classified
material.
petitioner,
federal
employee's
union
and
one
of
its
officials
filed
sued
on
behalf
of
affected
employees
in
the
service
claiming,
among
other
things,
that
the
testing
program
violates
the
fourth
amendment.
the
district
court
agreed
and
enjoined
with
the
program.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
vacated
the
injunction
and
upheld
the
testing
program
holding
that
though
the
program
involved
searches
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment,
those
searches
are
reasonable
in
light
of
their
limited
scope
and
a
strong
answer
was
asserted
by
the
custom's
service.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
below
in
part,
vacate
in
part,
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
we
uphold
the
testing
program
as
it
applies
to
employees
directly
involved
in
drug
interdiction
and
those
who
handle
firearms.
we
vacate
and
remand
for
further
consideration
of
the
testing
of
employees
who
handle
classified
material.
as
in
the
skinner
case
involving
railroad
employees,
we
find
that
the
testing
program
here
does
affect
searches
under
the
fourth
amendment.
nonetheless,
it
has
special
needs
of
present
beyond
the
ordinary
needs
of
law
enforcement.
we
must
balance
the
public
interest
served
by
the
program
against
the
privacy
concerns
of
the
affected
individuals
to
determine
whether
a
warrant
or
some
level
of
individualized
suspicion
is
required
in
order
to
uphold
the
constitutionality
of
the
program.
we
conclude
that
a
warrant
is
not
required
in
this
case.
it
would
only
serve
to
divert
valuable
resources
from
the
custom
service's
primary
mission
and
it
would
provide
little
or
no
added
protection
to
employees,
given
the
narrow
and
specific
limits
on
the
testing
program.
we
also
conclude
that
testing
is
reasonable
even
without
probable
cause
or
individual
suspicion
for
those
employees
in
positions
directly
involved
in
drug
addiction,
and
for
those
employees
who
are
required
to
carry
firearms.
the
government's
compelling
interests
in
protecting
the
promotion
of
drug
users
to
positions
where
they
might
endanger
the
integrity
of
our
nation's
boarders
or
the
life
of
the
citizenry
outweigh
the
privacy
interest
of
those
who
seek
promotion
to
these
positions.
we
enjoy
a
special
and
diminished
expectation
of
privacy
by
virtue
of
the
obvious
physical
and
ethical
demands
of
their
positions.
the
record
before
the
court
is
inadequate,
however,
to
allow
us
to
determine
whether
it
is
reasonable
for
the
custom
service
to
test
employees
who
would
be
handling
classified
information.
we
remand
this
issue
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
further
consideration.
the
court
of
appeals
should
consider
whether
this
aspect
of
the
program
is
constitutional
and
might
of
the
employees
who
are
tested
under
this
rationale.

privacy
expectations
of
those
employees,
and
the
material
that
is
considered
classified
for
these
purposes.
