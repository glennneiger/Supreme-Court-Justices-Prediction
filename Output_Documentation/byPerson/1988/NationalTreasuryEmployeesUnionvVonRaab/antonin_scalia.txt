mr.
williams,
how...
how
do
you
reconcile
the
notion
of
the
need
for
particularized
suspicion
with
the
requirements
that...
you
know,
when
we
think
of
these
privacy
cases,
i
suppose
every
federal
judge
thinks
of
the
annual
financial
disclosures
that
every
federal
judge
has
to
file
every
year
showing
all...
all
income
received
by
the
judge
and
by
his
spouse
and
children.
now,
is
there...
is
your
position
that
that
is
invalid
or...
or
is
there--
justice
antonin
scalia
--some
reason
why
that
invasion
of
privacy,
which
is
much
greater
because
that
goes
to
the
entire
public,
whereas
these...
these
tests
just
go
to...
are
not
published,
of
course.
they
don't
become
public.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you're
asking
me
to
decide
this
on...
if
you're
asking
me
to
decide
this
on
the
basis
of
whether
it's
a
greater
invasion
of
privacy
that...
that
i
should
give
a
urine
sample
when
i'm
up
for
a
promotion
or
a
transfer
versus
whether
i
should
publish
my
entire
financial
background
every
year,
you're
going
to
lose.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought...
i
thought
you
just
had.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
we
don't
know
how
many
might
have
not
applied
for
promotion
or
might
have
left
the
service
because
they
simply
could
not
get
rid
of
a
drug
habit
which
they
knew
would
turn
up
in
these
tests.
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
that's
really
the
crucial
figure,
isn't
it?
