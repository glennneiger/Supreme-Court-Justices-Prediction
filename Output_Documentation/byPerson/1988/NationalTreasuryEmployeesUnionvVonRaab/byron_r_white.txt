be
a
warrant--
justice
byron
r.
white
--on
that
basis.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
arguing
that
in
order
to
justify
these
tests
that
there
must
be
a
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
--so,
individualized--
justice
byron
r.
white
--suspicion
would
be
enough
even
though
there
the
government
has
plenty
of
other
ways
to
do
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
a
work
force--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
think
the
government
sort
of...
maybe
it
didn't
start
with
this,
but
it...
it
picked
out
the
customs
service.
why
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
--do
you
think
it
has
something
to
do,
though,
with
enforcement
of
the
law
against
the
importation
of
drugs?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think...
are
you...
are
you
telling
me
that
in
all
of
history,
there...
they've
never
discovered
a
faithless
customs
employee
that
is
conniving
with
some
importer?
justice
byron
r.
white
well--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
i
would
think...
i
would
think...
i
would
think
people
who
use
drugs
are
especially
subject
to...
to...
to
influence.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
have
to...
they
have
to...
customs
employees
don't...
i
don't
suppose
they're
rich.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
have
to...
that's
going
to
be
hard
to
feed
their
habit.
so,
there's
one
way
they
can
do
it
i
suppose
is
conniving.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all
you
need
is
one
or
two
moles
in
the
customs
service
to
really
cause
a
lot
of
problems.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you...
you
say
the
service
must
be
above
suspicion.
and
yet,
you
insist
on
suspicion
as
the
premise
for
the
test.
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
don't
they...
don't
they
give
physical
exams
to...
to
people
who
want
to
be
a
customs
inspector?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
the
inspectors?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
there
any
evidence
then
to
find
out
if
some
person
is
an
alcoholic
or
a
drug
user?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
blood
test?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
did
you...
but
at
that
time
was
there
any
record
of
people
who
withdrew
or
who...
who
otherwise
would
have
applied
for
a
transfer?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
of
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
might...
if
there
were
a
lot
of
withdrawals,
i
suppose
that
might
be
one
explanation
you
didn't
find
anybody.
