justice

paul
stevens
but
does
it
have
the
authority
to
raise
the
dues?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
isn't
that
a
legitimate
issue
for
debate
within
the
union,
even
though
it's
in
trusteeship?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
did
this
man
have
the
right
to
take
the
position
he
took,
or...
why
is
that
sabotaging
the
trusteeship?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it's
something
that
is
open
for
fair
discussion
within
the
union?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
only
question
i
have
now
is
if
i
understand
your
word
sabotage.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
specifically
you
wanted
him
to
support--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--by
a
dues
increase.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's...
except
the
difference
is
that
in
the
other
case,
the
leader
of
the
union
has
been
democratically
selected,
so
presumably,
the
people
that
that
leader
would
appoint
are
those
that
the
majority
of
the
voting
membership
would
want
in
those
positions.
but
you
don't
have
that
situation
under
trusteeship.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
mr.
fisher,
would
the
case
be
any
different
if
instead
of
being
in
trusteeship,
you
just
had
a
different
union
constitution,
and
just
gave
the
head
of
the
union
the
authority
to
remove
all
business
agents,
even
those
that
had
been
elected?
it
would
be
the
same
case,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
the
trusteeship
is
relevant
for
anything
except
the
fact,
as
you
suggest,
that
the
trustee
has
the
power
of
removal,
because
certainly
you
would...
i
would
think
you
would
agree
that
there
would
be
a
violation
if
they
said:
take
him
out
in
the
alley
and
beat
him
up
because
of
the
speeches,
or
something
of
that
kind.
that
would
be
a
violation,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
no
membership
right.
he'd
still
have
his
right
to
everything...
the
same
membership
rights
he
has.
he
just
would
have
suffered
same
adverse
consequences
from
his
speech.
but
he'd
remain
a
member
of
the
union,
all
the
job
rights,
and
all
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
would
you
think
there
would
be
a
violation
in
that
instance?
yes
or
no?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
they
just
cut
his
salary
in
half,
but
let
him
continue
in
his
position?
that
would
be
forbidden,
then,
i
suppose?
we
don't
like
the
speech
you
made,
so
instead
of
making
$300
a
month
in
this
job,
you'll
make
$100.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
fisher,
is
there
any
evidence
that
this
agent
was
unsatisfactory
for
any
reason
except
his
opposition
to
the
dues
increase?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
for
purposes
of
our
decision,
we
assume
none
of
that
other
happened?
i
think
you're--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
on
the
other
hand,
we
also
assume
that
really
the
only
reason
for
discharge
was
his
speech?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
there
may
well
have
been
other
factors.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
[inaudible]
to
whether
you're
trying,
you
try
and
solve
the
financial
problems
by
cutting
expenses
on
the
one
hand,
or
by
raising
dues
on
the
other?
i
know
it's
oversimplifying--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
one
way
to
cut
expenses
is
to
get
rid
of
some
of
the,
some
of
these
people,
and
this
was
consistent
with
his
views
on
the
major
authority.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
irony
of
your
argument
is
that
if
the
principal
sort
of
acts
as
though
he
has
the
right
to
make
the
decision
when,
as
i
understand
it,
it
is
a
decision
that
had
to
be
made
by
the
membership?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
are
you
doubting
his
power
to
remove
him
for
refusing
to
support
affirmatively
the
dues
increase?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
instead
of
the
facts
we
have,
just
say
he
asked
him
to
get
up
and
make
a
speech
in
favor
of
it,
and
he
said:
i
won't
do
it.
could
he
then
have
fired
him?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
add...
supposing
an
embezzlement
charge
had
been
brought
by
the
trustee.
would
the
trustee
have
had
to
follow
the
same
procedures
of
preferring
charges,
and
so
on,
or
could
he
have
just
sliced
him
off
right
away?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
does
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
i
must
confess
i'm
a
little
puzzled.
you
indicated
to
the
chief
justice
that
the
trustee
did
have
the
power
to
remove
an
elected
official
without
following
these
procedures,
as
i
understood
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh.
you
would
have
to...
now,
did
he
follow
these
procedures
in
this
case?
