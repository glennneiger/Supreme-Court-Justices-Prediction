--well,
suppose
the
executive
committee
and
the
president,
whoever
it
was
that
could
try
to
get
some
help
out
of
him
decided
on
a
program,
and
they
wanted
to
sell
it
to
them.
suppose
that
they
wanted,
the
old
committee
wanted
to
raise
dues,
and
they
would
have
to
get
the
consent
of
the
membership?
justice
byron

and
they
asked,
they
ask
the
business
agents,
everybody
who
is
an
elected
member
to
help,
to
go
out
and
support
it,
or
at
least
not
oppose
it.
would
that
have
been
cause
for
removal
of
the
business
agent?
justice

because?
justice
byron

well,
i
know,
but
people
can
agree
or
disagree
on
all
sorts
of...
whether
a
particular
shop
rule
is,
or
a
particular
provision
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
valid.
do
you...
would
the
business
agent
be
violating
any
duty
to
his
superiors
if
he
refused
to
support
the
ratification
of
a
particular
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
has
been
negotiated
by
his
superiors?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
whoever
they
are.
suppose
the
president
and
the
executive
committee,
whoever
they
are,
ask
him
to
support
this
collective
bargaining
agreement.

justice

--well,
they
were
exercising
their
right
of
speech,
their
claimed
right
of
speech.

but
the
staff,
however,
were
appointed.
justice
byron

white
the
staff
were
appointed.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
business
of
speaking
was...
if
that
was
the,
if
that's
what
was
being
retaliated
against,
in
finnegan,
it
is
here,
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right
but
in
this
case,
though,
they
got
canned
for
speaking.
justice

before
or
after
lmrda
could
have
provided
that
a
trustee,
if
he
wanted
to
remove
somebody,
had
to
have
good
reason.
it
could
have...
the
constitution
itself
could
have
provided
that
he
couldn't
remove
an
elected
official,
for
example.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
that
you
suggest
that
we
decide
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
absent
title
1,
the
trustee
could
have
done
what
he
did
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
say
about...
don't
you
think
there
was,
in
finnegan,
that...
i
find
a
lot
in
finnegan
that
says
that
title
1
isn't
violated
unless
you
infringe
on
members'
rights
as
members.
justice
byron
r.
white
rather
than
as
officers.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
didn't...
they
didn't
remove
this
gentleman,
your
client,
as
a
member,
or
even
attempt
to.
they
just
removed
him
as
an
official.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
with
all
that,
was
all
that
you
read
from
that
purporting
to
fine
a
union
member
for
opposing
a
dues
increase?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
suppose
this
speech
that
this
man
made
didn't
have
any
connection
with
his
job
as
a
union
agent.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
just
got
collective
bargaining,
administration,
and
things
like
that,
collective
bargaining
duties,
and
the
question
of
a
dues
increase
has
nothing
to
do
with
his
job.
his
interest
then
is
as
a
member.
why
wasn't
he
speaking
as
just
a
member,
and
was
then
disciplined
for
it
by
losing
his
job,
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
dues
increases?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that...
as
far
as
i
read,
what
his
job
was,
he
was
certainly
had
to
do
his
job
as
described
in
the
constitution.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
to
do
it
the
way
he
was
told
to
do
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
dues
increases.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
blame
the
trustee
for
trying
to
get
as
much
support
as
he
could
in
the
membership.
and
he
could
campaign
for
it.
but
i
don't
know
why
he
was
entitled
to
insist
that
the
business
agent
do
anything
more
than
an
ordinary
union
member.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
for
that
purpose.
he
was
his
agent
for
doing
what
business
agents
do.
