chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
in
no.
86-1940,
sheet
metal
workers'
international
association
v.
edward
lynn.
mr.
fisher,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--can
a
trustee,
mr.
fisher,
make
policy
for
the
local
the
same
way
as
elected
officials
could,
if
it
weren't
in
trusteeship?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
union
hadn't
been
in
trusteeship,
mr.
fisher,
the
people
in
charge
of
the
union
under
the
union
by
laws
could
have
removed
mr.
lynn
the
same
way
the
trustee
aid?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
wasn't
done
here,
though.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
fisher.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
stark.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
was
elected
their
business
agent?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
are
the
duties
of
the
business
agent?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--who
were
his
superior
officers
in
the
local,
or
other
officers
in
the
local?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
take
a
parliamentary
system
of
government,
mr.
stark.
the
parliament
represents
the
sovereignty
of
the
people,
and
yet
you'll
have
a
cabinet
and
a
prime
minister.
now,
the
people
in
the
cabinet
are
themselves
members
of
parliament.
they
have
every
right
that
a
member
of
parliament
has.
but
you
don't
stay
in
the
cabinet
unless
you
go
along
with
the
government.
you
don't
say:
i'm
going
to
parliament
and
appealing
because
you're
the
sovereign.
the
prime
minister
says:
fine.
you
go
back
and
take
your
seat
as
a
member,
but
you're
out
of
the
cabinet.
now,
why
isn't
that
analogy
applicable
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
case,
to
your
mind,
then
turns
on
whether
or
not
lynn
was
elected
or
appointed?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your...
your
client
was
the
plaintiff
in
the
federal
district
court,
mr.
stark?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
he
make
any
claim
there
or
in
the
ninth
circuit
that
apart
from
title
1,
the
trustee
had
no
authority
under
the
bylaws
or
constitution
to
remove
him?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
old
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
ever
pass
on
that
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i'm
not
interested
in
what
the
district
court
ruled
on
whether
finnegan
applied.
i
want
to
know
did
the
district
court
ever
pass
on
the
question
of
whether
apart
from
title
1
the
union
constitution
or
bylaws
would
have
prevented
the
trustee
from
removing
your
client?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
did
the
ninth
circuit
ever
pass
on
it?
they
wouldn't
have
gone
to
title
1
if
they
had,
would
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
title
1.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
do
you
make
any
point
here
that
the
union
constitution
or
bylaws,
apart
from
title
1,
didn't
authorize
the
trustee
to
remove?
had
it
not
been
for
title
1,
do
you
contend
that
the
trustee
nevertheless
couldn't
have--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--so
if
title
1
doesn't
prevent
it,
nothing
else
does.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
there
is
a
trusteeship?
you
answered
me
a
few
minutes
ago,
i
got
the
impression
you're
giving
a
different
answer
to
justice
stevens.
assume
there
is
a
trusteeship...
not
that
the
original
elected
officials
are
in.
have
you
ever
contended...
do
you
contend
in
this
court
that
the
trustee
lacks
authority
under
the
union
constitution
or
bylaws
to
remove
lynn?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--yes.
you'll
have
to
answer...
i
think
you
can
let
each
one
of
us
speak
for
ourselves,
and
perhaps
all
of
us
will
let
one
another
do
that.
why
don't
you
try
to
answer
my
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
you've
been
peppered
by
a
number
of
questions.
my
question
is
this:
supposing
he
were
caught
or
doing
exactly
what
he
was
doing,
speaking
in
opposition
to
trustee
policy
at
this
meeting,
do
you
claim
that
the
trustee,
if
there
had
been
no
title
1,
do
you
claim
that
the
trustee
lacked
authority
under
either
the
union
constitution
or
bylaws
to
fire
him
for
doing
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
so
you
agree
the
trustee
could
do
that,
except
for
title
1?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
fisher.
your
time
has
expired.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
86-1940,
sheet
metal
workers
versus
lynn
will
be
announced
by
justice
marshall.
