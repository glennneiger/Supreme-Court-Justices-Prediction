o'connor
well,
mr.
fisher,
doesn't
title
3
also
provide
that
if
a
trustee
is
established,
that
it
will
be
administered
for
legitimate
purposes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
how
is
it
legitimate
for
the
trustee
to
try
to
stifle
dissent
on
this
issue
of
dues
increase?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
the
agents
don't
agree
with
him?
in
their
honest
disagreement,
does
the
trustee
have
a
right
to
stifle
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
did
the
trustee
have
the
power
to
dismiss
him
for
any
reason
during
the
trusteeship?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
it
doesn't
turn
on
this
particular
right
to
discuss
a
dues
increase?
you
say
there
is
nothing
that
would
have
given
the
trustees
the
power
to
take
the
action
that
he
did
against
mr.
lynn?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
my
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
for
no
reason
of
policy?
just
a
desire
to
have
someone
the
trustee
can
get
along
with?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
some
right
that
you
find
in
title
1,
there's
some
section
in
title
1
of
the
act
that
you're
relying
on?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
is
it?
