justice
antonin
scalia
please,
let
me
ask
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
referred
to
the
trustee's
authority
repeatedly
as
autocratic.
it
is
autocratic
for
most
things,
but
is
there
any
indication
that
he
is
supposed
to
have
some
special
authority
to
determine
the
outcome
of
elections
on
that
one
issue
of
dues
increase
which
is
left
to
the
democratic
process?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
virtually
everything,
except
with
respect
to
dues
increase.
that's
not
his
decision.
that
has
to
be
taken
democratically.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
the
crux
of
the
case,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned...
whether
the
authority
given
to
the
trustee,
the
autocratic
authority...
i
think
it's
right
to
refer
to
them
as
autocratic
authorities...
includes
the
authority
to
influence
by
his
actions
the
outcome
of
that
democratic
election.
that
one
item--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
under
your
view
he
could
have
been
fired
for
refusing
to
get
up
and
speak
for
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
why
not,
if
he
has
that
autocratic
power?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
among
his
duties
are
to
assist
and
cooperate
with
the
officers
of
local
unions
and
the
members
thereof
in
carrying
out
the
provisions
of
this
constitution.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
sure
that
this
union
couldn't
have
a
standard
policy
on
a
matter
such
as
whether
a
particular
clause
should
be
included
in
the
next...
in
the
next
labor
agreement?
the
president
might
want
it,
and
the
vice
president
might
not
want
it,
and
they
could
present
no
common
front?
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
no
obligation
for
the
officers
to
go
along
with
the
president
of
the
union
on
matters
such
as
this
sort?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
stark,
suppose
there
hadn't
been
a
trustee
appointed.
would
the
president
of
the
union
have
had
the
right
to
dismiss
your
client,
if
your
client
had
been
caught
embezzling
funds?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
would...
removal
action
would
what?
go
to
the
memberships
like
a
kind
of
impeachment,
or
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
he
was
elected?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
manner
done
here,
i
think
the
chief
justice
means,
not
through
the
impeachment
provisions.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
to
remove
him
the
way
he
was
removed
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
stark,
is
it
critical
to
your
case
that
the
issue
involved
was,
was
the
question
of
dues
increase?
suppose
the
issue
had
been
what
terms
are
we
going
to
negotiate
for
in
the
next
contract?
suppose
that
had
been
the
issue.
would
you
still
be
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
isn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--even
though
the
trustee,
as
i
understand
it,
would
have
the
authority
to
say:
we're
going
to
go
for
better
working
conditions
rather
than
a
wage
increase.
isn't
he
authorized
as
part
of
his
trusteeship
to,
to
run
the
union
to
that
extent?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he
can't
fire
them
for
not
supporting
him
on
that
point,
any
more
than
he
can
fire
them
for
not
supporting
him
on
this
point
of
dues
increase?
