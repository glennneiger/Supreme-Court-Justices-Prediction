mr.
bruce
m.
stark
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
what
we
need
some
elaboration
on
the
facts
as
to
how
this
came
about,
that
lynn
ran
for
office
on
a
platform
of
economy
and
fiscal
integrity
of
his
union,
something
that
predated
the
conflict
that
we
have
here.
a
majority
of
members
of
the
union
were
concerned
with
the
fiscal
well-being
of
their
union
and
formed
a
sheet
metal
club.
and
that
sheet
metal
club
sponsored
a
group
of
candidates
to
run
for
office
on
that
enunciated
platform.
and
mr.
lynn
prevailed
over
six
or
eight
other
candidates
for
the
position.
he
was
elected
by
a
majority
of
the
members
to
speak
out
on
the
policy
that
the
sheet
metal
club
supported.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
yes.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
it
appears
that
in
mr.
lynn's
case,
the
duties
of
the
business
agent
involved
enforcing
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
handling
grievances,
negotiating
the
terms
of
the
bargaining
agreement,
in
some
instances
signing
the
bargaining
agreement,
and
setting
policy
within
the
union.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
i
believe
he
had
the
job
a
little
over...
almost
two
years.
a
little
over
a
year.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
there
was
another
business
agent,
there
was
a
business
manager,
there
was
a
president,
there
was
an
executive
board,
and
some
other
and
sundry
offices
that
were
all
elected.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
well,
petitioners
claim
that
there
was
a
subordination
there.
i
would
suggest
that
as
a
duly
elected
officer,
he
had
the
same
status
as
any
other
duly
elected
officer,
albeit
perhaps
some
different
duties.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
right.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
absolutely
not.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
because
it's
a
free
speech
right,
it's
a
matter
of
open
debate
at
a
membership
meeting
where
reasonable
people
can
agree
and
disagree
as
to
the
wisdom
of
that
course
of
action.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
mr.
justice,
when
you
say
his
superiors,
perhaps
i'm
confused.
as
the
duly
elected
business
representative--
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
--no,
no.
because
the
labor
union
is
a
microcosm
of
our
society
as
a
whole,
and
our
elected
officials
do
not
follow
in
locked
step
with
one
another.
there's
room
for
divergent
opinion,
and
in
this
case,
mr.
lynn
was
representing
and
enunciating
a
position
on
which
he
based
his
platform
for
election,
and
i
would
suggest
that
his
superiors
were
the
majority
of
the
members
who
elected
him,
and
the
majority
of
the
members
that
eventually
prevailed
on
four,
not
just
one
or
two,
but
four
propositions
for
the
membership
to
raise
dues
and
four
which
were
rejected.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
portions
of
it
are,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
portions
of
it
are,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
as
to
his
official
duties
as
a
business
agent,
it
describes
in
rather
broad
fashion
what
a
business
agent
might
do.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
of
course,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
it's
at
page
50
of
the
joint
appendix,
section
8
of
the
constitution
gives
some
rather
general
and
broad
framework
of
the
duties
of
a
business
manager
and
a
business
representative.
however,
that's
not
dispositive
of
what
mr.
lynn
actually
did
in
local
75.
i
think
we
have
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
sheet
metal
workers
is
a
rather
large
union,
that
encompasses
many
different
crafts.
we
have
the
construction
sheet
metal
works,
for
example,
who
put
in
the
duct
work
for
air
conditioning
and
heating
in
buildings,
whereas
mr.
lynn
was
in
a
kitchen
fabricating
shop,
where
they
manufacture
the
stainless
steel
and
the
custom-made
kitchenware
that
goes
into
a
commercial
restaurant
facility.
so
the
duty
as
spelled
out
broadly
in
the
sheet
metal
workers'
constitution
does
not
necessarily
apply
strictly
to
mr.
lynn's
duties.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
and
mr.
lynn
was
doing
exactly
that.
he
was
cooperating
with
the
majority
of
the
membership
who
felt
that
reducing
expenses
was
the
first
step
towards
fiscal
responsibility
rather
than
raising
dues.
i
would
say
that--
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
--well,
that
occurs
all
the
time
in
negotiating
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
very
often
there
will
be
a
compromise
on
a
clause
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
does
not
represent
a
total
consensus
of
the
bargainers,
and
very
often
it's
submitted
to
the
membership,
and
the
membership
reject
it
because
they
did
want
a
particular
clause,
and
the
negotiating
team
did
not
get
it.
the
ultimate
sovereignty
is
with
the
membership.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
not
when
they're
going
to
the
membership,
because
the
membership
represents
the
sovereignty
of
the
union.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
because
you're
not
elected
to
the
cabinet.
the
president
appoints
a
cabinet,
and
also
we're
dealing
with
a
party
system
where
we're
dealing
with
such
things
as
party
loyalty,
and
the
analogy
just
is
not
representative
to
a
union
such
as
the
sheet
metal
workers'
union
where
you
do
not
have
a
party
a
and
a
party
b,
and
you're
maintaining
party
loyalty
and
party
discipline.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
oh,
i
think
it's
very
significant,
because
mr.
lynn
was
elected
to
represent
a
particular
point
of
view
of
his
constituency,
which
did
comprise
the
majority
of
the
membership.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
absolutely
not.
the
trustee
had
no
greater
powers
than
were
available
to
any
other
union
officer
under
the
lmrda.
the
council
indicates
plenary
powers,
but
there
is
absolutely
nothing
to
substantiate
that
discussion
of
plenary
powers.
the
plenary
powers
are
not
to
be
found
in
their
brief,
nor
in
the
law.
in
fact,
petitioners
admit--
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
--well,
when
you
say
that
there
was
nothing--
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
--well,
if
we
want
to
pose
that
hypothetical,
and
assume
that
they
found
that
mr.
lynn
was
embezzling
money,
well
of
course
there's
an
action
that
the
trustee
could
take,
and
there
is
a
procedural
due
process
for
such
an
exigency,
that
they
could
bring
charges
against
him,
they
could
take
him
away
from
the
funds,
and
bring
charges
against
him--
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
--pardon?
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
in
your
second
hypothetical,
justice
o'connor,
no.
you
could
not...
the
trustee
could
not
remove
him
just
because
he
disliked
him.
he's
a
duly
elected
officer,
and
in
this
case
there's
no
doubt,
in
fact
the
trustee
admitted
that
he
terminated
him,
removed
him,
kicked
him
out
of
office.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
yes.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
the
free
speech
provision,
of
speaking
out
on
a
matter
of
public
concern
before
a
general
union
meeting,
as
required
by
101
(a)(3).
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
i
have
no
disagreement
with
finnegan.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
well,
there
are
many
unions
such
as
in
finnegan,
which
was
a
teamsters'
case,
the
operating
engineers,
and
the
machinists
union,
who
elect
a
business
manager
who
enunciates
a
platform
and
a
policy
that
he
proposes
to
carry
out.
and
in
finnegan,
this
court
correctly
ruled
that
that
business
manager
could
select
his
own
staff
to
carry
out
that
policy
which
was
mandated
by
his
election
by
the
membership.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
pardon?
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
the
staff
were
appointed.
in
this
case,
we
have
mr.
lynn,
who
was
duly
elected
on
a
platform
and
to
represent
a
constituency
just
the
same
as
the
principal
business
manager
who
was
duly
elected.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
except,
except
that
the
business
agents
in
finnegan
were
appointed.
they
did
not
run
for
office.
they
did
not
have
to
stand
for
election
by
the
membership.
in
this
case,
lynn
did.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
but
in
this
case,
lynn
was
elected
by
the
membership
to
speak
out
and
represent
a
certain
philosophy.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
alleged
in
the
complaint.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
well,
since
it
went
to
the
court...
well,
the
district
court
ruled
that
finnegan
applied,
that
somehow
or
other
there
was
a--
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
--not
directly,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
well,
the
ninth
circuit
ruled
that
a
cause
of
action
had
been
stated,
which
precluded
summary
judgement--
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
--under
title
1.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
well,
under
the
union's
constitution
and
bylaws,
it's
purported
that
the
trustee
would
have
that
authority.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
that's
correct.
title
1
precludes
that,
because
we're
dealing
with
a
free
speech
issue
on
a
matter
coming
before
the
membership,
and
the
distinction
with
finnegan
is
that
mr.
lynn
was
duly
elected
for
that
purpose,
to
represent
his
constituency
on
a
particular
point
of
view.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
well,
if
he
was
caught
embezzling
funds,
he
would
have
had
the
right
to
prefer
charges
against
him,
and
start
removal
action
against
him.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
well,
as
counsel
indicated,
it
would
go
to
a
trial
committee.
there
would
be
charges
brought
against
him,
he'd
be
given
an
opportunity
to
prepare
a
defense.
there
would
be
a
full
and
fair
hearing
before
a
tribunal
within
the
union.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
even
though
he
was
elected.
it's
the
same
as
an
impeachment
or
a
recall
of
any
other
duly
elected
official.
but
under
these
circumstances,
no,
he
would
not,
and
i
agree
with
justice
stevens,
who's
saying
that
the
trusteeship
is
irrelevant.
it
is
irrelevant,
because
we're
dealing
with
a
tree
speech
issue
under
title
1,
that
he
chose
to
speak
out
in
opposition
to
a
dues
increase
as
his
constituency
elected
him
to
do,
and
the
constituency
agreed
with
him...
not
once,
but
four
times
they
agreed
with
him.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
no.
the
trustee
would
have
to
follow
the
same
provisions
in
title
1
of
the
lmrda.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
title
1
being
procedural
due
process
far
a
given
offense,
and
section
609
being
an
absolute
prohibition
of
taking
any
discipline
for
exercising
your
rights
under
the
act.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
oh,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
i
hope
i
didn't
say
that.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
no,
he
did
not.
he
did
not
follow...
he
did
not
follow
the
procedures
under
the
lmrda,
nor
did
he
follow
the
procedures
under
the
sheet
metal
workers'
constitution
and
bylaws.
because
as
counsel
indicated
that
if
you're
going
to
remove
an
elected
official,
absent
any
trusteeship,
which
i
still
agree
is
immaterial,
that
he
would
still
be
provided
a
trial,
which
was
not
provided
mr.
lynn.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
no,
because--
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
--oh.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
well,
i
get
a
new
ingredient.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
one
is
on
embezzlement,
and
one
is
on
speech.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
your
hypothetical,
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
if
he
was
caught
embezzling,
would
the
trustee--
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
--oh,
absent
title
1,
then
the
trustee
could
do
that,
because
that
would
put
us
back
into
pre-lmrda
days.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
that's
correct.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
and
the
lmrda.
in
fact,
the
intent
of
congress
as
stated
in
the
preamble
to
the
lmrda
is
to
correct
those
very
defects,
and
to
correct
the
very
sins
that
occurred
here.
the--
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
--well--
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
--well,
i
think
you're
driving
at
one
of
the
sacred
principles
of
labor
unions
and
collective
bargaining
agreements,
and
that
is
no
removal
except
for
just
cause.
and
purportedly,
the
sheet
metal
workers'
constitution
enunciates
the
same
thing,
but
in
this
case,
they
did
not
provide
it.
they
claimed
that
by
virtue
of
the
trustee,
they
had
plenary
powers,
as
they
phrase
it,
and
he
could
do
anything
he
wanted.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
absent
title
1
and
prior
to
the
lmrda,
he
could
have
done
this.
that
is
correct,
and
that
is
what
the
lmrda
was
passed
to
preclude
occurring,
that
the
trustee
in
this
case
had
no
greater
authority
than
any
other
officer,
and
the
lmrda...
and
in
fact,
petitioners
admit
that
they
had
to
go
to
the
membership
to
get
a
dues
increase
under
title
1
of
the
lmrda...
and
then
on
the
other
hand,
they
turn
around
and
say:
well,
we
don't
have
to
respect
title
1
under
the
lmrda,
we
can
just
go
ahead
and
remove
an
official
because
he
spoke
out
against
something
that
displeased
one
of
the
officers.
that
is
not
what
the
lmrda
is.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
yes.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
that's
correct.
in
fact,
in
finnegan,
they...
that
phrase
is
repeated
several
times.
but
in
this
particular
case,
i
would
suggest
that--
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
--but
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
making
that
distinction
in
this
case
is
artificial
and
strained,
because
if
the
membership
elects
a
person
to
speak
out
in
their
behalf
on
a
certain
policy
issue,
and
a
minority
pulls
a
coup,
and
boots
him
out
of
office,
does
that
not
affect
the
membership
right
to
have
a
spokesman
of
their
own
choosing?
and
i
would
point
out
that
finnegan
also
states
that
the
act's
primary
objective
was
ensuring
that
unions
would
be
democratically
governed
and
responsive
to
the
will
of
the
membership.
and
that
being
the
case,
how
can
you
have
a
union
that
is
democratically
governed
and
responsive
to
the
will
of
the
membership
if
you
have
one
dictator,
either
president,
trustee,
or
business
manager,
who
says:
i
disagree.
we're
going
to
get
rid
of
that
majority
opinion.
and
i
think
that
this
is
the
very
thing
that
was
also
pointed
out
in
finnegan,
that
where
you're
dealing
with
a
duly
elected
representative
of
the
membership,
that
it
tips
the
balance
in
lynn's
favor.
this
is
also
spelled
out
in
finnegan,
and
i
would--
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
--i'd
still
be
here.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
because
that
is
a
matter
that
the
membership...
that
was
brought
up
at
the
membership
at
an
open
meeting,
and
saying:
here's
one
proposition,
we
want
to
go
for
wage
increases
and
the
other
one
says:
no,
we
want
to
go
for
fringe
benefits.
the
membership
takes
a
vote,
people
speak
pro
and
con,
the
membership
votes
and
says
we
want
to
go
for
wage
increase,
then
you
don't
turn
around
and
boot
out
of
office
those
who
spoke
on
the
other
side,
just
because
you
don't
like
them.
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
well,
again,
the
trustee
has
no
greater
authority
than
the
other
officers
of
the
union.
now,
the
trustee
could
in
fact
say:
i
don't
want
to
go
to
the
membership
with
this
issue.
i
want
to
go
for
wage
increases,
and
that's
it.
and
that's
what
we're
going
to
negotiate.
he
runs
the
risk
of
bringing
it
back
to
the
membership
for
a
vote,
and
having
various
people
speak
out
on
it,
including
perhaps
some
of
the
negotiating
committee,
which
often
happens,
and
having
the
membership
turn
it
down,
say:
no,
we
want
fringe
benefits.
the
officer--
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
--that
is
correct.
as
long
as
he's
a
duly
elected
officer,
which
is
altogether
different
situation
from
finnegan...
altogether.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
what
the
petitioners
in
this
case
are
seeking
is
to
rewrite
title
3
to
restore
practices
that
congress
specifically
legislated
against.
and
i
would
also
like
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
we
live
in
a
representative
democracy.
and
congress
in
passing
the
lmrda
sought
to
apply
that
to
the
labor
organizations.
and
title
4
would
be
for
nought
if
minority
views
could
be
silenced
by
immediate
reprisals
that
occurred
in
this
case.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
what
those
immediate
reprisals
were.
within
a
matter
of
days,
not
only
was
mr.
lynn
booted
out
of
office,
he
was
newer
dispatched
for
work,
notwithstanding
his
a
classification,
and
to
this
very
day--
mr.
bruce
m.
stark
--no,
it's
not,
your
honor.
but
i
make
this
point
because
we
are
dealing
with
a
summary
judgement
in
the
court
below,
and
the
court
below
in
the
ninth
circuit,
emphasized
the
fact
that
this
was
a
practice
on
the
part
of
the
defendants
to
stifle
dissent
and
to
stifle
debate
and
the
antithesis
of
democratic
operation
of
the
unions,
and
remanded
it
back
to
the
district
court
to
hear
evidence
on
those
issues
that
mr.
lynn
alleged,
which
is
at
pages
9
and
10
of
the
record,
the
joint
appendix,
in
his
complaint,
that
those
were
viable,
genuine
issues
of
material
fact
to
be
litigated.
and
that's
the
reason
that
i
raise
it
here
now...
is
on
that
basis
that
the
summary
judgement
was
reversed
quite
properly
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
sent
back
to
the
district
court
to
hear
evidence
on
that
point,
because
mr.
lynn
was
in
effect
not
only
kicked
out
of
office,
he
was
kicked
out
of
the
hiring
hall,
and
has
never
been
dispatched
for
work.
and,
i
think
too,
that
the
results
were
immediately
achieved.
after
lynn
was
disciplined,
the
trustee
went
back
for
a
fifth
vote
for
a
dues
increases
and
finally
got
it.
and
i
think
that's
a
very
important
fact
in
this
case.
but
i
think
the
most
important
part
is
what
this
court
recognized
in
finnegan,
that
unions
must
be
democratically
governed
and
responsive
to
the
will
of
the
membership,
and
this
is
exactly
why
congress
passed
the
lmrda.
in
their
preamble,
they
pointed
out
that.
congress
found
that
very
often,
labor
union
members
were
not
allowed
to
choose
representatives
of
their
own
choosing,
and
that
the
labor
unions
were
not
paying
due
regard
to
the
rights
of
the
individual
employees.
and
the
lmrda
was
passed
to
correct
that.
and
here
we
have
a
situation
where
a
majority
of
the
union
members
elected
lynn
on
a
specific
platform,
expecting
him
to
speak
out
on
fiscal
responsibility.
when
he
did
so,
a
minority
in
the
union...
albeit
under
purported
power
to
disregard
title
1
of
the
lmrda...
booted
him
out
of
office,
much
to
the
chagrin
of
the
majority
of
the
members
at
tending
that
union
meeting
and
voting
and
saying
no
dues
increase.
this
is
not
a
trusteeship
issue,
for
indeed,
this
is...
if
it
were
a
trusteeship
issue,
it
would
be
one
of
first
impression,
as
far
as
i
can
determine,
before
any
federal
court.
it
would
be
coming
to
the
supreme
court
for
the
first
time
for
resolution.
that's
not
the
case.
we're
dealing
with
a
free
speech
issue
under
title
1,
where
a
membership
right
was
directly
attacked
by
getting
rid
of
the
duly
elected
representative
who
was
acting
as
spokesman
for
the
members
in
that
union
that
elected
him.
they
expected
him
to.
thank
you.
