mr.
donald
w.
fisher
may
it
please
the
court:
the
case
at
bar
is
similar
to
and
the
international
submits
a
logical,
at
most
a
logical
extension,
of
finnegan
v.
leu,
which
has
decided
by
this
court
about
five
years
ago.
if
anything,
the
case
is
a
stronger
case
for
the
union
than
finnegan,
because
in
finnegan,
there
were
15
appointed
business
agents
that
were
working,
and
who
were
dismissed
because
they
had
in
the
past
supported
the
political
opponent
of
the
incumbent
president
and
campaigned
for
him.
and
in
finnegan,
the
new
president,
the
newly-elected
president,
extrapolated
from
that
fact,
believing
that
these
people
would
not
be
good
agents.
they
would
not
be
loyal
to
him,
they
would
not
carry
out
his
policies,
and
therefore
he
dismissed
them
on
a
wholesale
basis.
in
this
case,
we
have--
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
--in
the
finnegan
case,
it
was
held
that
an
elected,
an
appointed
agent,
such
as
these
business
agents,
were
not
denied
their
rights
under
sections
101(a)(1)
and
(a)(2)
of
the
lmrda,
because
of
this
indirect
infringement
upon
their
expressive
activity,
as
i
read
the
case,
mr.
justice
white.
in
this
case,
we
have
the
same
type
of
confidential
policymaking
agents.
in
this
case,
the
agent
who
was
removed
from
his
office
during
the
period
of
the
trusteeship,
was
originally
elected
to
his
position,
but
at
the
time
the
activity
involved
occurred,
the
union
had
been
placed
under
a
trusteeship
by
the
international
union,
and
the
trusteeship
was
administering
the
affairs
of
the
local
union,
and
had
plenary
authority
under
the
union
constitution
to
remove
and
replace
any
officers
or
employees
of
the
local
union.
now,
this
particular
business
agent,
lynn,
not
only
was
likely
not
to
support
the
rehabilitative
policies
of
the
trustee,
but
he
actually
did
not
support
them,
and
in
truth,
he
sabotaged
the
policies.
and
it
was
only
after
this
series
of
events
took
place
that
the
trustee
decided
that
he
could
not
continue
to
operate
and
administer
the
affairs
of
the
local
union
and
try
to
correct
the
conditions
for
which
the
trusteeship
was
imposed
with
lynn
on
his
staff.
so
lynn--
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
--yes,
sir.
the
trusteeship
has
the
authority
to
administer
the
affairs
completely
of
the
local
union
during
the
period
of
the
trusteeship,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
no,
sir.
it
does
not
the
authority
to
raise
the
dues.
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
well,
it
is
not...
mr.
justice
stevens,
it
is
not
the
position
of
the
international
union
that
it
is
not
a
legitimate
matter
for
debate,
just
as
in
the
finnegan
case,
it
was
a
legitimate
matter
for
debate
who
was
to
be
the
next
president
of
the
local
union.
it
is
of
course
a
right
of
a
member
under
sections
101(a)(1)
and
101(a)(2)
as
a
member
to
take
positions
on
matters
of
importance
in
local
union
affairs.
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
well,
because--
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
--well,
it
is
no
more
open,
justice
stevens,
than
the
issue
of
who
was
to
be
president,
as
i
say,
in
finnegan
v.
leu.
every
member
has
the
right
to
take
a
position
on
issues
before
the
local
union,
and
every
right,
every
member
of
a
local
union
definitely
has
a
right
to
express
those
views.
those
are
rights
of
membership,
and
mr.
lynn,
after
he
was
removed
from
his
position
as
a
business
manager,
continued
to
have
his
rights
to
express
himself
on
issues
that
came
before
the
local
union.
there
is
no--
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
--the
trustee
wished
to
encourage
the
members
to
support
his
program
of
correcting
the
conditions
in
the
local
union--
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
and
he
wanted
that
policy
to
be
supported
by
the
agents,
the
business
manager
has
the
right
and
the
duty
and
the
trustee,
who
was
in
control
of
the
union
in
place
of
the
business
manager,
has
the
right
and
the
duty
and
in
fact,
he
must
act
through
people
who
become
his
representatives.
now,
when
a
representative
of
the
trustee...
it
could
just
as
well
have
been
a
representative
of
the
manager,
if
the
local
wasn't
in
trusteeship--
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
--you
do
not
have
this,
mr.
justice
stevens,
in
this
case.
but
we
do
have
title
3
of
the
lmrda,
which
recognizes
the
imperative
necessity
for
putting
unions
under
autocratic
control
under
a
condition
of
trusteeship
to
operate
for
a
period
of
at
least
18
months,
during
which
the
presumption
of
legitimacy
applies,
in
order
to
work
a
union
out
of
these
conditions
of
extremis
that
caused
the
international
to
impose
a
trusteeship
in
the
first
place.
and
in
this
case,
there
was
never
a
question
but
that
the
trusteeship
was
properly
imposed.
in
fact,
all
of
the
union
officials,
all
of...
the
president,
the
business
manager,
all
of
the
business
agents,
including
mr.
lynn
himself,
did
send
a
letter
to
the
general
president
of
the
international
union
asking
for
relief,
including
a
trusteeship,
if
he
considered
it
desirable,
because
the
local
union
needed
help.
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
it
does,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
justice
o'connor,
it
is
not,
and
it
seems
to
me
this
is
one
of
the
lessons
from
finnegan...
it
is
not
stifling
dissent
in
the
local
union
for
a
person
in
authority,
a
business
manager
or
an
international
union
trustee
to
wish
to
present
the
program
through
agents
that
will
agree
with
him,
and
carry
out
his
policy.
just
as
mr.
leu
wanted--
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
--the
trustee,
it
is
our
position,
has
the
right
to
remove
them
as
his
agents...
as
the
persons
through
whom
he
must
act,
and
whom
he
must
necessarily
rely
on,
and
with
whom
he
is
in
a
confidential
position
with,
relationship
with.
after
that,
obviously,
as
union
members,
the
individuals
are
free
to
take
any
position
on
any
issue
that
they
wish.
i
mean,
their
rights,
as
union
members,
of
speech
have
not
been
infringed,
and
as
the
court
said
in
finnegan,
we
are
dealing
with
what
is
at
most
an
indirect
infringement
of
speech
when
a
union
employee
is
removed
from
his
position
because
of
his
disagreement
on
a
matter
of
principle
with
his
superior.
otherwise,
a
principle
certainly
must
have
the
right
under
the
act...
and
we
think
this
was
recognized
in
finnegan...
to
have
agents
who
are
responsive
to
him,
and
who
will
carry
out
his
wishes.
mr.
lynn
did
not.
mr.
lynn
not
only
opposed
the
policies
of
the
dues
increase,
which
was
a
critical
part
of
the
policy,
but
he
spoke
against
it.
he
campaigned
against
it.
he
belonged
to
organizations
and
attempted
to
induce
them
to
oppose
it.
he
spoke
against
the
issue
vigorously
at
the
meeting,
and
then
when
the
issue
was
defeated,
he
publicly
crowed
about
it.
he
took
credit
for
defeating
the
very
policy
of
the
person
who
was
his
principal
and
the
policy
he
was
attempting
to
espouse.
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
not
in...
under
the
constitution
of
this
union,
there
is
no
removal
power,
arbitrary
removal
power
on
the
part
of,
let
us
say,
the
business
manager,
who
has
the
right
to
direct
the
business
agents.
the
only
way
that
a
business
agent
can
be
removed
from
office
is
by
the
process,
under
the
union's
constitution,
of
filing
charges.
there
would
have
to
be
a
hearing
on
these
charges.
it
would
be
tried
before
probably
a
local
union
trial
board,
and
they
would
decide
either
that
there
were
grounds
for
his
removal
or
there
weren't.
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
no,
sir,
because
the
trustee...
once
the
union
is
placed
under
trusteeship,
under
the
constitution
of
the
sheet
metal
workers,
has
the
authority
on
his
own
to
remove
and
replace
anyone
he
wishes.
he
has
plenary
power
of
removal
and
replacement,
not
only
of
mr.
lynn,
but
of
other
employees
in
the
union
hierarchy
also.
now,
in
the
leu
case,
of
course,
in
that
particular
local
union...
it
was
a
teamsters'
local...
in
that,
in
that
case,
the
business,
or
the
president,
who
was
essentially
here
the
same
as
a
business
manager
in
many
union
hierarchies...
the
president
did
have
the
right
to
replace
and
remove
his
agents.
and
i...
we
think
that
this
case
is
no
more
than
an
extension
of
the
law
of
agency,
that
a
principal
does
have
the
right
to
work
through
agents
with
whom
he
has
compatibility,
with
whom
he
is
comfortable.
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
if
the
president
of
the
union
had
the
authority
to
remove
elected
business
agents,
and
it
was
in
the...
and
he
has
such
authority
in
the
constitution?
it
would
get
closer
to
the
same
case.
it
would
get
closer
also
to
finnegan
v.
leu,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
that
is
taking
a
person's
membership
rights--
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
--well,
that
was
suggested
in
the
brief,
mr.
justice
stevens.
we
don't
think
that
that
analogy
or
that
example
is
applicable.
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
there
would
be
a
violation
of
his
right
as
a
member,
because
he
was
assaulted,
physically,
physically
harmed,
for
speaking
out
on
an
issue.
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
quite
different
from
saying
that
a
person
has
the
right
to
take
positions
diametrically
opposed
to
those
of
his
principal
and
remain
employed
by
the
union.
we
concede
that
he
had
a
right,
as
a
member,
to
go
to
a
meeting
and
to
speak,
and
to
take
any
position
that
he
wished
to
take
as
a
union
member.
but
to
say
that
that
person
also
has
the
right
to
be
and
to
remain
an
agent--
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
--justice
stevens,
i
really
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
all
i
know
is
that
this
is
a
question
of
a
right
to
choose
the
people
that
you
want
to
work
with.
you
either
work
with
them,
on
the
one
hand,
or
you
don't
work
with
them.
now,
if
you
can
penalize
them,
you
say,
in
some
way,
by
cutting
their
salary,
i
really
don't
know
what
the
answer
to
that
question
would
be.
i
would
think
it
would
be
less
than
the
situation
we
have
here,
which
is
a
person
has
the
right
to
select.
for
instance,
i
don't
think
cutting--
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
--the
salary
in
half
of
an
agent
would
mean
that
the
principal
was
unwilling
to
work
with
him,
i
mean,
the
normal--
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
--excuse
me,
justice
marshall.
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
the
international
president?
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
he
cannot
do
anything
to
the--
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
--the
international
president
cannot...
well,
do
you
mean...
if
the
international
president
had
someone
on
his
staff,
who
was--
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
--yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
well,
the
international
president,
when
the
local
union
is
operating
under
conditions
of
local
autonomy,
could
do
nothing
more
than
prefer
charges
if
he
felt
that
what
the
agent
did
or
what
the--
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
--not
unless
there
was
a
violation
of--
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
--well,
the
local
is
not
placed
into
trusteeship
for
any
improper
or
ulterior
motive
here.
everyone
wanted--
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
--no,
sir.
i
believe
under
title
3--
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
--what
would
stop
it
from
being
done
is
it
would
not
be
for
a
proper
purpose
under
the
statute.
a
suit
could
be
brought.
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
well,
that's
why
the
landram
griffin
law
was
enacted,
and
there
are
rights
given
to
members
who
believe
that
their
rights
or
their
prerogatives
under
the
bill
of
rights
have
been
violated.
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
i...
i
can't
agree
with
the
proposition
you're
positing,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
i
can't
see
it,
because
there
is
no
evidence
whatever
in
this
case,
and
in
fact
it
is
not
true
that
the
trusteeship
was
imposed
in
any
way
because
of
the
presence
on
the
staff
of
mr.
lynn
as
a
business
agent.
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
a
trusteeship
that
was
imposed
for
the
purpose
of
getting
rid
of
a
business
agent
that
a
union
president
or
a
general
president
didn't
like
would
not
be
imposed
for
one
of
the
purposes
under
the
statute,
and
it
would
be
impermissible
if
challenged
in
suit.
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
now,
it
is
clear,
moreover,
in
this
case,
that
mr.
lynn
was
not
really
opposed
to
a
dues
increase
as
such,
because
he
was
asked
by
the
trustee,
mr.
hawkins,
to
support
the
policy
and
he
said
he
wouldn't
support
it,
and
mr.
hawkins
asked
mr.
lynn
what
it
would
take
to
support
it,
and
he
said
you've
got
to
fire
two
other
people
on
the
staff.
you've
got
to
fire
the
business
manager,
who
was
a
mr.
fox,
and
you've
got
to
fire
another
business
agent...
there
were
two
business
agents
on
the
staff.
xxx
mr.
hawkins.
after
such
a
statement
is
made
to
the
principal,
who
has
to
work
through
agents,
that
i
won't
support
this
policy
unless
you
fire
these
people,
and
if
you
do
fire
these
people,
i
will
support
the
policy,
he
could
not
work
with
that
agent.
it
became
a
burden
and
the
statute,
if
it
please
the
court,
does
not
require
union
officials
with
plenary
removal
authority
to
work
through
agents
that
they
cannot...
that
are
not
cooperating
with
them,
and
that
they
cannot
deal
with,
and
will
not
further
their
objectives.
it
was
found
by
the
court
below,
and
it
is
not
disputed,
that
lynn's
suspension
from
employment
as
business
agent
didn't
impair
his
membership
rights
in
the
union.
he
was
entitled
to
and
did
attend
membership
meetings;
he
did
express
himself
on
issue
that
came
before
the
union,
and
he
exercised
all
rights
of
membership,
just
as
the
dismissed
agents
in
the
finnegan
v.
leu
case
did.
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
well,
it
turned
out,
subsequently...
which
is
not
part
of
this
case...
he,
his...
he
was
not
performing
his
duties
overall
in
a
satisfactory
manner.
but
that
is
not
before
the
court,
and
it
isn't
part
of
the
case,
justice
stevens.
there
were
other
complaints,
but
it
is...
it
appears
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence...
this
case
was
submitted
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgement.
in
fact,
it
was
cross-motions
for
summary
judgement,
and
there
were
undisputed
issues
of
fact
that
were
submitted
before
the
court.
and
the
court
had
those
controverted
issues
of
fact,
and
decided
this
case
on
the
basis
of
those
facts
and
of
no
other
cases...
no
other
facts,
excuse
me.
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
that
is
an
issue
that
is
being
litigated
at
this
time
before
the
national
labor
relations
board,
and
that
has
never
been
resolved.
and
those
are
not
the
issues,
again,
that
were
before
the
court
on
this
first
count.
the
only
issue
raised
in
the
count
that
is
before
this
court
is
the
question
of
whether
his
removal
as
business
agent
violated
his
speech
rights
under
section
101(a)(1)
and
101(a)(2)
of
the
act.
and
that
is...
that
is
the
only
issue.
the
other
parts
of
the
case
were
dismissed,
and
they
have
not
been
appealed.
they
are
not
before
this
court,
and
therefore
the
union
says
no,
but
it's
a
question
that
has
never
been
resolved.
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
that
is--
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
--well,
his--
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
--no,
his
speech,
and
his
statement
that
you
fire
these
other
two
people,
and
then
i'll
support
you.
it
is
his
position
of
opposition,
his
position
of
opposition
to
a
very
important
objective--
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
--certainly.
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
well,
i'm
not
saying
that
there
isn't
logic
to
his
position,
of
course.
but
the
principal
made
a
decision,
and
he
wanted
his
views
to
be--
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
--unquestionably.
it's
the
same
kind
of
decision--
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
--that
was
made
by
the
members
of
the
local
union
in
finnegan
v.
leu.
i
mean,
you
have
to
have
an
election
to
elect
officers,
and
you
have
to
have
an
election,
or
you
have
to
have
a
vote
in
order
to
raise
dues.
i
will
reserve--
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
--yes,
sir,
mr.
justice
scalia.
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
oh,
no.
when
i
said
autocratic,
he
does
have
autocratic
authority
in
terms
of
who's
going
to
work
and
who
isn't
going
to
work,
and
what
things
are
done.
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
that
is
correct,
and
as
a
member,
he
had
the
right
to
oppose
it.
but
as
a
person
attempting
to
implement
the
policy
of
the
trustee,
the
trustee
wished
to
have
his
representatives
at
least
not
actively
oppose
his
program
to
solve
the
union's
economic
problems
by
a
dues
increase.
now,
that
could
be
turned
down
by
the
members...
there
is
no
doubt
about
it,
and
in
this
case
it
was,
justice
scalia.
but
it's
a
question
of
whether
this...
whether
after
having
refused
to
go
along
with
the
team
to
carry
out
the
policy
of
the
superior
official,
in
those
circumstances,
the
principal
could
get
rid
of
an
unwanted
agent.
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
well,
i
don't
know
that...
justice
scalia,
i'm
not
saying
that
it's
influence.
he
wasn't
fired
because
he
didn't
get
up
and
speak
for
it.
but
he
totally
opposed
it,
and
it
was
against
the
program
and
it
was
against
the
policy
that
the
trustee
was
attempting
to
input,
and--
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
--oh,
no.
i'm
not...
i
really
don't
say
that,
justice
stevens.
i'm
not
saying
that
at
all.
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
no,
if
i
used
the
term
autocratic,
i
may
have
made
a
problem
for
myself.
i'm
not
talking
about
czarist
russia,
or
anything
like
that.
i'm
simply
saying
that
the
union
trustee
does
have
the
right
to
administer
the
affairs
and
to
remove
personnel,
and
it
is
so
stated
in
the
constitution,
and
it
is
at
least
as
much
authority
as
mr.
leu,
the
new
business,
or
the
new
president
in
finnegan
v.
leu,
had,
when
he
fired
those
15
business
agents.
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
refusing
to
support
affirmatively?
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
i
presume
he
could
have.
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
make
only
the
observation
that
many
of
the
facts
that
mr.
stark
spoke
on
are
not
part
of
the
facts
in
the
record.
this
again
is
a
case
that
was
submitted
on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgement,
and
the
uncontroverted
facts
are
before
the
court
in
the
appendices.
an
unverified
complaint
was
filed
by
mr.
lynn.
those
facts
are
not
assumed
to
be
true
with
respect
to
a
motion
for
summary
judgement.
this
was
not
the
granting
of
a
motion
to
dismiss,
this
was
a
case
decided
on
the
basis
of
a
motion
for
summary
judgement.
now,
on
the
facts
of
record,
to
answer
the
question
that
some
of
the
justices
asked
about,
it
is
clear
in
the
appendix
at
the
joint
appendix,
at
pages
42
and
43,
that
the
general
president
of
the
international
union,
when
he
imposes
a
trusteeship,
has
the
power
to
take
such
action
as
he
deems
necessary
to
protect
the
interest
and
welfare
of
such
local
union,
and
this
association
and
the
funds
and
property
and
membership
thereof,
including
but
not
limited
to
the
authority
to
suspend
local
union
or
council
officers,
business
managers
or
business
representatives,
fill
vacancies
in
such
offices
with
any
representatives
of
this
association
or
members
of
such
local
union,
or
call
elections
for
that
purpose,
and
impound
the
books,
records,
funds
and
property
of
any
such
local
union.
and
the
district
judge
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
the
writ
of
certiorari,
at
page
33a,
found
as
a
uncontroverted
fact
that
the
general
president
delegated
to
hawkins
as
trustee
the
authority
in
the
constitution
under
article
3,
section
2(c),
and
he
quotes
from
the
constitution,
"to
take
such
action
as
he
deems
necessary
to
protect
the
interests
and
welfare
of
local
75,
its
funds,
property
and
membership,
and
the
interest
and
welfare
of
the
international
association,
including
but
not
limited
to
the
right
to
suspend
local
union
officers,
the
business
manager
and/or
business
representatives
to
fill
vacancies
in
such
positions.
"
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
well,
there
is
no
fine--
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
--no.
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
no,
i--
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
--well,
he
was
required
to
operate
and
work
at
the
direction
of
the
business
manager.
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
well,
the
policy
that
was
formulated
by
the
trustee...
the
trustee
was
sent
in
by
the
general
president.
the
trustee
was
to
formulate
policies
to
rehabilitate
the
affairs
of
this
local
union.
this
was
the
policy
that
was
decided
upon
by
the
trustee.
it
was
correct
that
this
policy
could
not
be
self-implemented.
this
policy
had
to
be
submitted
to
the
membership
for
their
approval,
because
they
wanted
a
dues
increase.
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
well,
because
he
was
his
agent,
and
his
personal
representative.
mr.
donald
w.
fisher
business
agents
attempt
to
follow
the
policies
that
are
set
down
by
the
board
of...
the
executive
board
of
the
local
union,
and
when
the
executive
board
of
the
local
union
is
really
not
operating
functionally
because
of
a
trusteeship,
then
the
policy
of
the
local
union
is
set
by
the
president.
now,
the
members
have
the
right
to
vote
to
decide
the
issue.
but
in
terms
of
taking
a
firm
position
as
to
whether
he
is
going
to
oppose
it,
and
try
to
thwart
it--
