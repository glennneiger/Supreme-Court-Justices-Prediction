mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
believe
counsel
for
petitioners
has
made
the
case
this
afternoon
artificially
too
easy
for
us
because
it
is
perfectly
clear
from
this
court's
cases
that
if,
indeed,
a
rule
6(e)
claim
is
reviewable
post
conviction,
that
is
the
end
of
the
analysis
for
purposes
of
the
collateral
order
doctrine
because
the
third
prong
of
the
collateral
order
doctrine
requires
that
the
error
be
"effectively
unreviewable".
if
he's
right
that
it's
effectively
reviewable,
then
he's
wrong
that
it's
subject
to
the
collateral
order
doctrine.
we'd
like
to
make
the
case
harder
for
ourselves.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
that
is,
i
take
it,
because
he
believes
that
rule
6
is...
any
violation
of
rule
6
is
by
its
nature
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
which,
in
turn,
gives
you
a
right
not
to
be
tried.
i
think
there's
no
support
for
that
proposition.
we'd
like
to,
however,
make
the
case
harder
and
begin
with
the
premise
that
mechanik
controls
this
case
and
that
on
conviction,
not
only
would
he
have
suffered
through
the
process
of...
of
going
to
trial,
but
that
after
tried
and
after
conviction,
he
would
be
subject
to
the
harmless
error
rule
of
rule
52(a).
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
off...
offhand
it's
hard
to
know
exactly,
justice
o'connor,
what
that
would
look
like.
i
suppose
one
possibility
is
this.
if
a
rule
6(e)
violation,
a
disclosure
of
matters
occurring
before
the
grand
jury,
was
so
pervasive
that
it
became
in
the
nature
of
pretrial
publicity
so
that
a
trial
court
or
reviewing
court
lost
confidence
in
the
reliability
of
the
verdict
as
a
barometer
of
whether
or
not
there
was
antecedent
probable
cause,
then
i
suppose
it
would
be
the
case
that
mechanik
would
not
control.
but
that
would
be
true
not
by
virtue
of...
of
a
rule
6(e)
error
as
such,
but
by
virtue
of
its
continuing
effect
on
the
petit
jury,
not
on
the
grand
jury.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--there's
no
question
of
it.
it
does,
indeed,
serve
purposes
apart
from
what
6(d)
serves.
on
the
other
hand,
it's
not
at
all
clear
to
me
that
to
the
extent
it
serves
those
other
purposes,
it
conveys
on
a
defendant
the
right
to
challenge
his
indictment.
i
take
it
that
the
real
lesson
of
bank
of
nova
scotia
is
not
the
lesson
that
my
colleague
draws,
but
the
lesson,
rather,
that
the
defendant's
ability,
right,
to
challenge
his
indictment
turns
on
the
prejudice
to
him.
so,
for
example,
rule
6(e)
unlike
rule
6(d)
serves
a
number
of
systemic
purposes:
protecting
the
secrecy
of
witnesses,
safeguarding
the
grand
jurors'
own
rights
to
not
have
their
names
in
the
papers,
so
on...
to
be
subject
to
harassment.
but
those
aren't
rights
that
i
take
it
a
defendant
would
have
the
right
ever,
pre
or
post
conviction,
to
get
his
indictment
dismissed
on.
the
only
thing
he
can
claim
under
bank
of
nova
scotia,
as
we
read
it,
is
that
his
grand
jury
presentation
has
been
tainted,
that
the
probable
cause
determination
is
unreliable.
and
that
is
a
claim
that
washes
away,
we
believe,
in
mechanik.
now,
of
course,
this
court
doesn't
ultimately
have
to
resolve
that
question.
but
on
the
assumption
that
it
did
wash
away
in
mechanik,
become
harmless
as
a
matter
of
law,
we
believe
nevertheless
that
the
collateral
order
doctrine
would
not
entitle
the
defendant
in
this
case
or
any
other
to...
to
interlocutory
review.
i
think
it's
very
important
to
take
into
consideration
here
what
exactly
the
claim
of
rule
6(e)
error
is
in
this
case.
and
this
returns,
justice
o'connor,
to
the
question
that
you
asked
counsel
earlier,
whether
he
could
say,
based
on
the
facts,
that
in
fact
there's
a
compromise
of
independence.
the
answer
is
there
isn't
a
ghost
of
a
compromise
of
independence
in
this
case.
the
case
is
barely
a...
falls
under
6(e)
at
all.
what
you
have
here
is
basically
a
claim
that
the
government
attached
a
memorandum
arising
from
civil
litigation
in
which
it
revealed
a
witness
who
was
going
to
be
called
before
the
grand
jury,
and
revealed
as
well
the
nature
of
the
grand
jury
investigation,
all
of
which,
as
the
district
court
properly
found,
had
been
revealed
by
midland
asphalt
in
their
own
moving
papers
in
that
civil
litigation.
the
fact
that
this
is
on
its
face
essentially
a
frivolous
claim
is
not
the
point.
the
point
is
that
claims
like
this
are
always
available.
anybody
can
cook
them
up.
and
the
f.
2d
volumes
are
chock
full
of
motions
just
like
this.
now,
counsel
candidly
acknowledges
that
his
claim,
in
fact,
is
less
substantial
than
many
others
he
could
imagine.
he
also
suggests
that
in
the
final
analysis,
most
of
them
will
be
found
not
to
be
very
meritorious,
and
therefore
we
don't
run
the
risk
of
having
criminal
prosecutions
derailed.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
all
of
these
things
can
be
alleged,
and
allegations
are
what
get
you
into
federal
court.
allegations
are
what
get
you
into
the
courts
of
appeals,
and
allegations
are
what
brought
this
case
to
this
court
today.
it's...
every
grand
jury
case
has
not
just
6(e)
motions
available
to
it,
but
claims
that
there's
too
much
hearsay,
claims
that
there's
prosecutorial
overreaching.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
yes,
justice
o'connor,
it
was.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
no,
we're
not.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
not
necessarily.
let...
if
i
can
back
up
a
moment,
there...
the
second
circuit
has
sort
of
flip-flopped
on
the
issue
of
whether
rule
6
is...
rule
6(e)
claims
can
be
reviewable
post
conviction.
following
their
decision
in
midland
asphalt
in
a
case
called
united
states
v.
friedman,
et
al.,
they
held
in
fact
that
a
rule
6(e)
claim
could
not
be
reviewed
post
conviction
in
light
of
mechanik.
so,
it's
unclear
exactly
what
the
state
of
the
law
is
in
the
second
circuit.
we
believe
that,
in
fact,
for
the
reasons
that
the
chief
justice
suggested
before,
that
mechanik
would
control
this
case
as
well.
but,
justice
o'connor,
this
court
doesn't
have
to
resolve
that
today.
plainly,
it
mechanik
does
not
control
and
a
rule
6(e)
claim
survives
the
conviction,
then
the
collateral
order
issue
is...
is
quite
an
easy
one,
as
i
suggested
at
the
outset.
we...
we
propose
to...
to
defend
the
harder
position
because
it's
only
that
one
that
is
plausibly
controversial.
if
it
does...
if
mechanik
does
control
and
it
is
subject
to
the
harmless
error
standard...
and
frankly,
we
believe
that
the
logic
of
mechanik
does
extend
to
rule
6(e)
claims.
if
it
controls,
nevertheless
there
is
not
interlocutory
review.
the
suggestion
that
has
been
made
by
counsel
for
petitioners
today
is
that,
in
fact,
it's
possible
to
narrow
the
class
of...
of
orders
subject
to
interlocutory
review
by
subjecting
it
to
a...
to
the
following
legal
standard:
whether
the
error
somehow
compromises
the
right
to
an
independent
grand
jury.
apparently,
counsel
believes
that
the
claim
in
this
case
compromises
an
independent
grand
jury,
and
my
guess,
frankly,
is
that
kind
of
contention
can
be
made
in
almost
every
case.
there
really
isn't
a
limiting
principle,
and
that
in
the
end
is
the
point.
precisely
as
this
court
said
in
the
cohen
case
that
these
decisions
have
to
be
made
on
a
practical
and
not
technical
basis,
we
suggest
that
the
practicalities
cut
against
interlocutory
review.
let
me
say
also
that
the
technicalities
cut
against
interlocutory
review
as
well.
we
believe
that,
as
this
court
has
articulated
the
collateral
order
doctrine,
to
be
collateral
in
the
appropriate
sense
requires
that
the
error
in
question
neither
affect
nor
be
affected
by
the
disposition
of
the
merits.
it's
hard
to
imagine
a
claim
that
would
be
more
affected
by
the
disposition
of
a...
of
the
merits
than
a
claim
which,
under
mechanik,
is
rendered
harmless
by
the
merits.
this
is
a
claim
in
a
sense,
because
it's
part
of
the
grand
jury's
charging
decision
and
its
finding
about
probable
cause,
that
is
so
bound
up
in
the
merits,
so
inextricably
linked
to
the
merits
that
once
the
merits
are
decided
by
the
petit
jury,
the
underlying
probable
cause
determination,
if
tainted
in
some
way,
is
nevertheless
harmless.
that
we
believe
cannot
satisfy,
as
a
result,
the
second
prong
of
the
cohen
test.
we
also
believe,
however,
that
these
claims
fall
the
third
prong
as
well.
they
fall
because
these
claims
do
not
entail
the
right
not
to
be
tried.
now,
i
understand
from
counsel's
argument
his
view
that...
in
fact
this
does
involved
the
right
not
to
be
tried
by
virtue
of
the
fifth
amendment
because
the
fifth
amendment
provides
that
you
shall
not
be...
individuals
shall
not
be
called
upon
to
answer
to
a
felony
charge
except--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--no,
no.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
suggested
that
in
fact
rule
6(e)
claims
were
not
governed
by
mechanik
and--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--and
therefore
would
be
effectively
reviewable
on
appeal.
they
did
not
go
off
on
the
fifth
amendment
analysis.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
we
believe
in
that
respect,
the
second
circuit
was
wrong,
but
we
also
believe
that
in
this
respect,
this
reliance
on
the
fifth
amendment
grand
jury's
clause,
the
petitioners
are
wrong.
it
is
not
the
case
that
even
were
this
allegation
tantamount
to
the
claim
that
he
has
been
denied
an
indictment
by
a
grand
jury...
even
if
these
kinds
of
allegations
amounted
to
that...
and
they
don't...
nevertheless
you
would
not
have
the
right
not
to
be
tried.
that
is
not
what
the
fifth
amendment
means.
if
it
did,
it
would
be
hard
to
see
how
the
court
in
abney
could
have
held,
as
it
did,
that
an
insufficient
indictment
is
nevertheless
not
subject
to
interlocutory
review.
surely
a
claim
that
an
indictment
is
legally
insufficient
is
by
far
a
more
dramatic
case
of
the
violation
of
the
grand
jury
clause
than
the
claim
that
there
has
been
some
matters
occurring
before
the
grand
jury
that
have
been
unfortunately
leaked.
so,
i
think
it's
impossible
to
located
in
rule
6
or
in
the
fifth
amendment
grand
jury
clause
a
right
not
to
be
tried.
and
as
we
read
this
court's
criminal
cases
involving
the
collateral
order
doctrine,
if
you
cannot
satisfy
the
right-not-be-tried
standard,
if
the
substance
of
the
right,
as
this
court
articulated
in
the
macdonald
case...
if
the
substance
of
the
right
does
not
give
rise
to
a
right
not
to
be
tried,
it
follows
then
that
it
is
not
"effectively
unreviewable"
within
the
meaning
of
cohen's
third
prong.
in
short,
even
viewed
technically
as
opposed
to
practically,
this
claim
cannot
succeed.
and
we
believe,
in
fact,
that
it
is
a
good
thing
that
this
claim
cannot
succeed
as
a
technical
legal
matter
because
even
if
the
cohen
criteria
did
not
otherwise
preclude
immediate
review,
the
prospect
of
delay
and
appellate
gridlock
would
be
reasons
enough
to
reject
petitioners'
contentions.
delay,
of
course
is--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--we
believe
that
is...
that
is
surely
the
case.
it
doesn't...
our
argument
doesn't
rest
alone
in
that,
justice
kennedy,
but
it
does
rest
in
part
on
that.
we
believe
that
when
you
look
at
the
competing
costs
of
creating
a
new
category
of
interlocutorially
appealable
orders
in
criminal
cases,
in
the
final
analysis,
it
is
much
better
to
entrust
these
decisions
to
district
judges
and
that
it's
unlikely,
we
think,
that
it
will
entail
any
considerable
costs.
at
least
it
will
not
entail
any
net
costs
to
the
system.
we've
suggested
in
the
brief,
justice
kennedy,
why
we
believe
it's...
it
is
sufficient
to
entrust
these
decisions
to
district
judges.
first
and
foremost,
we
think
there's
very
little
reason
to
believe
that
district
judges
get
these
decisions
wrong
very
often.
after
all,
in
order
to...
to
win
on
a
rule
6(e)
claim,
what
you
have
to
show
is
that
there
was
a
6(e)
violation,
and
then
you
have
to
show
that
there
was
prejudice,
prejudice
in
the
bank
of
nova
scotia
sense,
prejudice,
that
is,
in
the
sense
that
had
this
error
not
occurred,
the
grand
jury
would
not
have
reached
the
decision
that
it
reached.
now,
given
that
it's
only
a
probable
cause
standard
that
the
grand
jury
is
charged
with
making
a
determination
under,
it
follows
we
think
that
only
truly
egregious
6(e)
violations
are
likely
to
allow
a
defendant
to
succeed.
and
we
think
that
those
kinds
of
errors
are
ones
that
district
judges
are
not
likely
to
overlook.
but
apart
from
that,
even
that
small
class
of
erroneously
denied
6(e)
errors
are
unlikely
in
the
experience
of
the
courts
of
appeal
to
be
subject
to
reversal.
in
fact,
our
research
discloses
no
examples,
before
or
after
mechanik,
in
which
a
court
of
appeals,
reversing
a
district
court,
ordered
an
indictment
to
be
dismissed
under
rule
6(e).
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
oh,
sure.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
that's
right.
until...
until--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
we...
we
say
that
as
we
read
mechanik--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--the
rationale
of
that
decision
would
control
6(e)
as
well
as
6(d)
to
the
extent
that
the
claim
is
that
the
6(e)
error
taints
the
reliability
of
the
grand
jury
determination.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
agree.
we
are
arguing
only
on
the
more
difficult
premise
for
us
but
which,
as
it
happens,
we
believe
is
the
correct
premise,
that
mechanik
does
control
this
class
of
errors.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
i'm
not--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i
think
i'm...
i'm
saying
something
a
degree
or
two
shy
of
that.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
and
let
me...
let
me
suggest
how.
if
a
district
judge
simply
gets
it
wrong--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
i
think
it's
hard
to
imagine
that--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--the
judge
this
one
wrong.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
but
truly
egregious
violations,
in
which
the
district
judge
has
simply
failed
to
exercise
his
discretion
at
all,
i
suppose
could
be
reviewable
under
a
writ
of
mandamus
provided
that
the
very
strict
criteria
set
out
in
will
against
united
states
were
met.
but
failing
that,
we
believe
that
in
fact
it
would
be...
we
acknowledge
it
would
be
unremediable
after
a
conviction
and
unreviewable
prior
to
trial.
and
that
means,
as
we
acknowledge
in
the
brief,
that
there
is
a
class
of
errors
as
to
which
the
district
judge
will
have
effectively
the
last
word.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
they
were
reviewing
that
although--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--although
i
should
say,
justice
white,
not
unmindful
of
the
fact
that
there
had
been
a
intervening
conviction
that
makes
a
difference.
but
let
me
say
that...
that
this
class
of
decisions
that
district
judges
make
is
not
in
our
view
meaningfully
distinguishable
from
a
wide
range
of
class
of
decisions
that
are
equally
subject
to
the
harmless
error
standard
post
conviction.
that
is
equally
true
about
routine
discovery
orders,
evidentiary
decisions
entered
mid-trial.
all
of
those
decisions
are
subject
to,
first
of
all,
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard
as
to
whether
it's
an
error
at
all
and,
second
of
all,
to
rule
52(a)
on
appeal.
now,
if
the
mere
fact
that
it's
extremely
unlikely
that
you
can
win
because
of
the
harmless
error
standard
is
enough
to
get
you
into
the
court
of
appeals,
it's
hard
to
see
where
the
line
ought
to
be
drawn.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
can't...
i
can't
cite
a
particular
case
although
i
have
to
believe
that
cases
come
up
on
mandamus
fairly
often
particularly
since
the
appellate
remedy
is...
is
thought
not
to
be
available.
but
i...
i
would
not
wish
to
be
understood
as
saying
that
we...
we
think
that
even
a
mandamus
claim
is
likely
to
succeed
because
it
has
a
particularly
strict
standard.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
fact
that
ultimately
this
is
subject
to
harmless
error,
as
i
say,
does
not
set
this
apart
from
a
great
many
other
errors,
and
in
the...
by
far
the
vast
majority
of
them,
a
defendant
is
not
going
to
succeed
as
a
result.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
that's
right.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
it
is
theoretically
possible.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
correct.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
it
is
a
difference,
however,
that
we...
we
think
ought
not
to
make
the
difference
between
interlocutory
review
because
the
lines
that
would
have
to
be
drawn
would...
would
entail
in
our...
in
our
view,
essentially
a
deluge
of
cases,
just
like
this
one,
that
will
be
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
yes.
i...
i
think,
as
i
was
saying
before,
if
the
6(e)
violation
was
so
pervasive
that
it...
it...
it
undermines
a
reviewing
court's
confidence
not
in
the
reliability
of
what
the
grand
jury
did,
but
in
the
reliability
of
what
the
petit
jury
did,
then
i
think
it
follows
that
the
conviction
is
no
longer
a
reliable
barometer
of
whether
there
was
probable
cause
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
that
is
correct.
i
think
it
is...
it
is
the
fact
that
if
mechanik
controls,
as
we
believe
it
does,
it
will
mean
that
in
the
normal
course
of
things,
a
defendant
will
not
be
able
to
persuade
a
court
of
appeals
to
overturn
his
conviction.
but
i
think
that
simply
by
virtue
of
that
fact,
which
we
acknowledge
freely,
these
claims
do
not
become
collateral
to
the
merits.
they
do
not
entail
the
right
not
to
be
tried,
and
there's
no
getting
away
from
the
fact
that
if
the
rule
is...
is
otherwise,
the
courts
of
appeals
are
going
to
see
lots
and
lots
and
lots
of
these
cases
because
anyone
can
claim--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
that's
correct.
it
is...
it
is...
it
is
possible
to
take
a
different
view
of
the
reach
of
mechanik
and
come
out...
come
out
our
way
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
that's
right.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
i...
i
think--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--that's
right.
i...
i
think
the
court
has
before
it
the
option
that
it
took
in
a
different
context
in
flanagan,
where
the
court
said
we
don't
need
to
decide
whether
prejudice
is
required
to
resolved
a
disqualification
motion
on
the
assumption
that
it
is
required.
there's
no
interlocutory
review
on
the
assumption
that
it's
not
required.
there's
no
interlocutory
review.
i
think
it
is
black-letter
law
that
if
mechanik
doesn't
control,
it's
therefore
reviewable
post
conviction,
and
that's
the
end
of
the
analysis.
and
i've...
i've
tried
to
defend
the
other
horn
of
that
dilemma,
which
i
think
the
rationale
of
mechanik--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--that...
that
is
precisely
our
view,
that
it
is...
it's
not
that
it's
unreviewable;
it's
that
it's
unremediable.
now,
that
sounds
like
a
distinction
without
a
difference,
but
we
insist
that
it's
a
distinction
with
a
legal
significance
at
least
in
this
court's
criminal
cases,
because
as
we
read
the
criminal
cases
involving
the
interlocutory...
the
collateral
order
doctrine,
for...
in
order
for
something
to
satisfy
the
third
prong,
to
be
effectively
unreviewable,
you
have
to
be
able
to
identify
a
substantive
right
at
stake
that
entails
a
right
not
to
be
tried.
and
it
has
never
been
held,
as
far
as
i
know,
in
this
court's
cases
that
the
fact
you
cannot
win
your...
in
getting...
when
you
get
review,
the
fact
that
you
can't
win
is
not
the
barometer,
is
not
the
standard.
that,
after
all,
is
the
argument
that
the
petitioners
made
in
stringfellow
from
two
terms
ago.
there
an
intervenor
sought
to
enter
an
environmental
lawsuit
and
was
denied
intervention
of
right.
he
was
granted
only
permissive
intervention.
and
he
said,
well,
i
ought
to
be
able
to
take
that
to
the
court
of
appeals
because
after
this
lawsuit
is
over,
no
court
of
appeals
is
ever
going
to
reverse
this...
this
judgement
just
because
i
couldn't
participate
as
freely
as
i
would
have
liked.
and...
and
i
think
the
way
he
put
it
in
argument
before
the
court
was
that
his
right
to
appeal
was
"academic"
at
best.
now,
he
was
probably
right.
probably
at
the
end
of
that
lawsuit,
a
reviewing
court,
perhaps
not
his
reviewing
court,
but
most
reviewing
courts,
would
be
reluctant
to
overturn
a
judgment
simply
because
that
litigant
could
not
participate
as
much
as
he
wanted
to.
but
the
fact
is
that
this
court
rejected
that
argument,
rejected
a
similar
argument
in
richardson-merrell,
because
the
prospect
of
success
is
not
the
standard
for
deciding
whether
something
is
effectively
unreviewable
or
not.
if
it
were,
we
believe
that
a
great
many
other
errors
which
are
essentially
as
unlikely
to
succeed,
if
not
quite
as
unlikely
to
succeed,
would
fall
within
the
same
umbrella.
there
is,
we
think,
in
the
final
analysis
this
central
irony
about
petitioners'
position.
they
contend
that
because
a
class
of
grand
jury
errors
may
one
day
turn
out
to
be
harmless,
those
errors
must
therefore
be
appealable
at
once.
that
is,
we
submit,
exactly
the
wrong
inference
to
draw.
an
error
is
called
harmless
because
it
has
no
the
decision
of
guilt
or
innocence.
and
an
error
that
has
no
bearing
on
guilt
or
innocence
is
a
very
poor
candidate
to
add
to
that
small
class
of
cases...
small
class
of
decision
that,
as
cohen
put
it,
are
too
important
to
be
denied
review
at
once.
for
those
reasons,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
dismissing
petitioners'
appeal
for
want
of
jurisdiction
should
be
affirmed.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
