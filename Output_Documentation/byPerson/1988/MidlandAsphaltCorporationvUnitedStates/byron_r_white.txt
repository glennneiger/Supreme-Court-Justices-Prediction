justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
you
could
ever
prove
that...
that
this
kind
of
a
violation
actually
would
undermine
the
independence
of
the
grand
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
we'll,
why
then...
why...
why
wouldn't
this
error
be
reviewable
on
appeal
after
conviction?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you--
justice
byron
r.
white
--so,
you
think
it
would
be--
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
think
it
would
be
harmless?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think...
do
you
think
on
appeal
after
conviction
you
could
have
the
conviction
reversed
because
of
this
error?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
why...
why
would
it
ever
be
appealable
before
the
final
judgement?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
it
just...
but
isn't
it
kind
of
speculative
to
know
whether
this...
whether
this
violation
really
had
a...
actually
had
an
effect
on
the
grand
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
say...
i
gather
your
position
is
you
don't
have
to
prove
anything.
you
just
have
to
prove
the
violation.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
wasn't...
this
wasn't
the
basis
for
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
are
there
cases
before
mechanik
that...
where
the
courts
of
appeals
old
review
after
a
conviction
one
of
these
claims
of
6(e)
error?
justice
byron
r.
white
and...
and
so,
they
assumed
that
it
was
reviewable
on
appeal.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
that's
wrong
now
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
you
can
win
without
our
agreeing
with
you
on
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
in...
where
there's
a
xx
say
it's
not
reviewable
on
appeal
under
mechanik
and
so
that,
in
effect,
there's
really
no...
no
remedy
for
even
an
egregious
6(e)
violation
that
takes
place
and
the
district
judge
has
gotten
it
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
you
say,
well,
they
can
go
after
the
attorney
and
say
you
shouldn't
be
doing
these
things.
justice
byron
r.
white
well--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
it
was
claimed
in...
it's
claimed
in
this
case
that
it
was
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
go
ahead.
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
until
mechanik,
the
courts
of
appeals
were...
were
reviewing
them.
