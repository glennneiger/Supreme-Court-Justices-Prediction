mr.
braun,
have
you
alleged
facts
in
this
case
that
would
even
fit
within
the
rule
you
propose
for
compromising
the
independence
of
the
grand
jury?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
the...
the
motion
and
the
argument
that
you
make
could
be
considered
post
judgment
by
the
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
just
seems
to
me
we
have
a
pretty
strong
policy
of
not
encouraging
interlocutory
appeals.
and
if
the
thing
is
reviewable
at
the
end,
i
wonder
if
the
importance
of
letting
things
go
ahead
doesn't
outweigh--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
robbins,
couldn't
there
be
some
violations
of
rule
6(e)
that
are
so
egregious
that
they
aren't
rendered
harmless
by
virtue
of
the
conviction?
isn't
that
theoretically
possible?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i...
i
don't
know.
i
think
there
could
conceivably
be
6(e)
violations
that
don't
fit
in
the
mechanik
format
it
seems
to
me.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and...
and
6(e)
serves
purposes
somewhat
different
than
6(d).
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the...
the
court...
the...
was
it
second
circuit
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
held
that
the
claim
would
be
reviewable
post
judgment.
you
are
not
defending
that
position
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
it
would
be
enough
for
us
to
affirm
and
say
no
interlocutory
review.
but
you
want
us
to
go
further
and
have
it
both
ways.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we
certainly
don't
need
to
adopt
your
view
of
mechanik
to
cut
off
collateral
review
or
interlocutory
review.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we
certainly
don't
need
to
adopt
that
extreme
position.
