justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
suppose
you
could
say
that
about
a
lot
of
violations.
so
long
as
they
don't
end
up
doing
any
harm,
what's
the
difference?
i
imagine
a
lot
of
district
judges
may
gnash
their
teeth
about
prosecution
asking
leading
questions
or
going
beyond
the
scope
of
direct
on
cross
or
something
of
that
sort
which
always
provokes
an
objection,
or
maybe
not
always,
90
percent
of
the
time,
but
even
when
it
doesn't,
it
should.
that's
all
wrong.
it
all
distorts
the
trial
process,
and
what
can
the
district
judge
do
except
gnash
his
teeth?
you
don't
have
interlocutory
appeals
in
order
to
stop
those
things,
do
you?
you
wait
until
the
trial
is
over.
if
it
has
affected
the
outcome
of
the
trial,
which
it
almost
never
does,
you
get
a
reversal.
but
you
don't...
you're
not
going
to
get
a
reversal
on
something
like
that
999
million
times
out
of
999
million
plus
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
you're...
but
you're
still
contending
that
even
if
you
went
to
trial
and
were
convicted,
you
would
still
be
able
to
get
your
conviction
overturned.
so,
you
are
saying
that
this
is
somehow
a
different
situation
from
mechanik.
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
why
is...
why
is
it
that
in
mechanik
you
couldn't
get
the
conviction
set
aside,
but
you
could
get
it
set
aside
here?
in
both
cases,
there's...
there's
a...
an
invalid
grand
jury
indictment.
why...
why
should
it
be
not
set-asideable
in
mechanik
but
set-asideable
here...
the
conviction?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
he
is...
he
hasn't
admitted
that
it's
effectively
reviewable.
he's
saying
you
can
review
whether
it
was
right
or
wrong,
but
it's
not
effectively
reviewable
because
you
can't
undo
the
trial
which
he...
which
he
shouldn't
have
had
to
go
through.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
here
that
he
can't
succeed,
i
think.
you're
saying
here
he
can't
succeed.
because
of
mechanik,
you're
saying
so
long
as
he's
convicted,
there
is
no
use.
but
in
these
other
instances,
evidentiary
error,
for
example...
the
judge
lets
in
something
that
he
shouldn't
have...
i
agree
with
you
that
the
chances
are
slim
you
would
get
a
conviction
reversed,
but
it's
conceivable.
it
happens
now
and
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
theoretically
possible.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
your
case
it's
not
even
theoretically
possible.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
a
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
also
follows
you
wouldn't
need
rule
6(e).
you
wouldn't
need
the
rule
6(e)
violation.
i
assume
in
that
case
you
could
simply
get
it
reversed
on
the
basis
that
the...
the
jury
verdict
is
not
reliable
because
of
adverse
publicity
or
whatever.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
hard
to
conceive
of
a
case
where
the
only
basis
for
your...
for
upsetting
the
conviction
would
be
rule
6(e).
justice
antonin
scalia
we...
we
would
have
to
take
the
extreme
view
of
mechanik
unless
we
were
to
want
to
decide
the
mechanik
issue
in
this
case
without
the
necessity
of
reaching
it.
in
other
words,
if
we're
not
going
to
decide
the
mechanik
issue
in
this
case,
we...
we
would
have
to
say,
assuming
the
worst--
justice
antonin
scalia
--assuming
that
mechanik
does
apply.
justice
antonin
scalia
otherwise,
we'd
have
to
decide
mechanik.
