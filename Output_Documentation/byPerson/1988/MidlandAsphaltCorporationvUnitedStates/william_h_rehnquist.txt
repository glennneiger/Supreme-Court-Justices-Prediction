we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
87-1905,
midland
asphalt
corporation
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
braun,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
sort
of
abuses,
to
be
more
particular,
do
those
authorities
suggest
it
was
designed
to
protect
the
potential
defendant?
from
bringing
him
to
trial
without
any
probable
cause?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
you...
but
you
are
appealing
to
these
great
historical
truths
about
the
grand
jury
in
the
time
of
the
stuarts
and
the
tudors.
and
there
wasn't
any
rule
6(e)
then.
i
mean,
the
general
idea
of
overreaching
and
so
forth
suggests
a
real
breach
of
some
sort
of
very
fundamental
idea.
rule
6(e)
and
some
of
the
other
rules
are
very
kind
of
detailed
prescriptions
as
to
conduct
in
the...
in
the
grand
jury
room.
for
instance,
to
have
two
witnesses
in
the
room
at
the
same
time
or
to
have
one
witness
read
and
then
another
witness
read
without
excusing
one
is
scarcely
the
sort
of
historical
overreaching
that
you...
that
those
authorities
are
talking
about,
i
dare
say.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think...
do
you
think
the...
the
examples
one
would
call
from
the
times
of
the
stuarts
and
the
tudors
is
that
there
were
two
witnesses
in
the
grand
jury
room
at
the
same
time?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
only
in
the
speech
and
debate
clause
case
and
the
double
jeopardy
case
that
we've
allowed
interlocutory
appeal
in
a
criminal
case,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you
say
now
we
should
add
to
that
this
right
that
you
say
not
to
be
indicted
by
a
grand
jury
that
has
violated
rule...
where
the
government
has
violated
rule
6(e).
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
claim
here,
of
course,
is
just
the
violation
of
a
rule
of
criminal
procedure.
it's
not
a
constitutional
claim
the
way
helstoski
and
the
double
jeopardy
case
were.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
that
happen?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what...
what...
what
authority
from
our
court
would
you
cite
for
that
proposition?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
dionisio
was
a
holding
against
the
person
who
had
been
indicted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
so,
it's
not
a
holding.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
whether
it
may
ever
be
deemed
harmless
is
quite
a
different
question
from
whether
a
mere
violation
of
a
rule
of
criminal
procedure
invariably
amounts
to
a
constitutional
violation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
public
releases
about
what
went
on
in
the
grand
jury
room...
i
can
see
why
that
would
have
some
effect
on
the
grand
jury.
why
does
it
undermine
its
independence?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
neither
of
those
really
points
to
failure
of
an
independent
charging
decision,
do
you
think?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
under...
under
our
holding
in
mechanik,
if...
if
your
claim
is
simply
that...
that
the
jury
indicted
without...
when
it
shouldn't
have
because
there
was
no
probable
cause,
that's
merged
into
the
verdict
of
the
jury
to...
to
convict.
i
thought
your
secrecy
claim
under
rule
6(e)
was
perhaps
somewhat
different
than
mechanik
because
you
might
show
some
sort
of
prejudice
to
the
defendant
in
standing
trial.
but
you
don't
rest
on
that,
do
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
would
you
differentiate
this
case
from
mechanik
then?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
each
case
the...
the
jury
did
return
a
verdict
of
guilty,
didn't
it?
your
case
hasn't
been
tried
yet?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
wasn't
on
the
facts
of
the
peculiar
case
in
mechanik,
but
the
idea
in
mechanik,
as
i
understood
it,
was
that
when
a
jury
convicts,
there...
any
prejudice
from
the
poorly
drawn
or
bad
conclusion
about
probable
cause
is
merged
because
the
jury
has
found...
the
petit
jury
has
found
that
you're
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
nova
scotia
certainly
didn't
say
that
it
changed
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
braun.
mr.
robbins,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
could
have
a
6(e)
violation
i
suppose
that
might
have
amounted
to
some
sort
of
pretrial
publicity
which
would
not
come
under
the
mechanik
head,
don't
you
think?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
if...
if
mechanik
applies,
is
it
so
much
a
question
that
it
isn't
reviewable
or
that
you're
just
not
going
to
be...
have
any
success
at
all
on
your
appeal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
robbins.
mr.
braun,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
braun,
your
time
has
expired.
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
