mr.
richard
james
braun
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
pretrial
appealability
of
decisions
by
district
courts
with
respect
to
indictments
in
which
a
6(e)
error
is
involved.
we
agree
with
the
government
that
this
case
is
governed
by
an
application
of
cohen.
the
government
has
agreed
with
us
that
at
least
the
first
of
the
three
cohen
prongs
has
been
satisfied
in
that
the
district
court
decision
conclusively
determines
the
question.
the
second
prong
of
cohen...
the
government
disagrees
that
that
prong
is
met
as
to
whether
or
not
the
case
involves
an
important
issue
separate
from
the
merits.
the
government
says
it
does
not
because
a
6(e)
violation
will,
under
this
court's
decision
in
mechanik,
be
merged
into
the
merits
and
become
harmless.
however,
the
government's
argument
assumes
that
the
6(e)
violation
did
not
undermine
grand
jury
independence
and
therefore
affect
the
grand
jury's
charging
decision
so
as
to
deprive
a
defendant
of
his
requirement
of
indictment
by
an
independent
grand
jury.
that
right
is
supported
by
two
of
this...
at
least
two
of
this
court's
previous
cases:
stirone,
which
said
that
the
purpose
of
the
fifth
amendment
requirement
of
indictment
by
grand
jury
is
to
limit
a
citizen's
jeopardy
to
offenses
charged
by
fellow
citizens
acting
independently,
judge
or
prosecutor.
this
case's...
and
this
court's
subsequent
decision
in
dionisio
that
the
fifth
amendment
guarantee
presupposes
an
investigative
body
acting
independently
of
prosecutor
and
judge
and
added
that
the
constitution
cannot
tolerate
the
transformation
of
the
grand
jury
into
an
instrument
of
oppression.
that
right
is
further
supported
by
this
court's
recent
holding
in
nova
scotia
that
if
there
is
grave
doubt
that
the
decision
to
indict
was
free
from
the
substantial
influences
of
prosecutorial
misconduct,
the
error
cannot
be
deemed
harmless
and
that
the
inquiry
is
into
the
impact
of
the
violation
on
the
grand
jury's
decision
to
indict.
the
constitutional
right
to
an
indictment
by
an
independent
grand
jury
is
also
supported
by
the
second
circuit's
1983
decision
in
hogan,
the
ninth
circuit's
1983
decision
in
sears.
6(e)
violations,
unlike
many
other
procedural
errors,
can
impact
adversely
on
a
grand
jury's
independence.
this
court
has
recognized
that
fact
in
again
at
least
two
of
its
previous
opinions.
in
the
pittsburg
plate
glass
case,
this
court
says
that...
said
that
without
secrecy,
the
grand
jury
would
not
be
able
to
act
with
the
independence
required
of
an
inquisitorial
and
accusatory
body.
in
douglas
oll,
this
court
again
emphasized
that
the
proper
functioning
of
the
grand
jury
depends
on
secrecy.
the
government
attempts
to
talk
about
rule
6(e)
and
the
rule
of
secrecy
being
merely
a
procedural
rule.
historically,
that
rule
going
back
to
the
middle
ages
and
the
english
institution
which
our
constitution
incorporated
demonstrates
that
the
purpose
of
the
incorporation
of...
of
the
requirement
that
a
citizen,
person,
not
be
required
to
stand
trial,
not
be
required
to
be
held
to
answer
except
upon
indictment
by
a
grand
jury
was
to
protect
persons
against
abuses
of
in
england
the
crown,
here
the
government.
that's
supported
by
edwards,
the
grand
jury
written
in
1906,
note

at
page
27,
a
michigan
law
review
article
by
richard
caukins,
grand
jury
secrecy,
63
michigan
law
review
455,
457
(1965).
mr.
richard
james
braun
yes.
as
this
court
recognized
in
nova
scotia
where
the
violation
has
an
impact
on
the
grand
jury's
charging
decision
and
therefore
by
implication
and
impact
on
the
grand
jury's
independence,
then
the
government
has
no
right
to
hall
a
man
into
court.
mr.
richard
james
braun
rule
6(d),
the
two
witness
in
the
grand
jury
rule...
its
purpose
was
to
preserve
grand
jury
secrecy,
as
rule
6(e)
more
directly
is.
mr.
richard
james
braun
no,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
a...
a
different
question
altogether,
at
least
in...
in
terms
of...
of
the
particular
facts
your
honor
poses.
i
think
the
rule
going
back
to
the
tudors,
as
illustrated
by
the
earl
of
shaftesbury
trial
and
the
trial
of
stephen
college
at
oxford
which
go
back
to
1681,
was
to
allow
the
jury
secrecy
in
which
to
interrogate
witnesses
so
that
they
would
be
unaffected
by
the
prosecutor,
that
is,
the
crown.
rule
6(e)
codifies
essentially
what
has
been
a
historic
practice
of
grand
jury
secrecy
on
which
the
grand
jury's
independence
depends.
and
for
that
reason,
once
the
grand
jury's
independence
has
been
eroded
by
government
disclosures
of
matters
occurring
before
the
grand
jury,
such
as
names
of
witnesses,
what's
occurred
in
connection
with
the
grand
jury
investigation,
the
nature
of
the
investigation,
there
is
the
potential
for
prejudice,
the
potential
that
such
disclosures
could
affect
the
charging
decision
and
erode
the
independence
of
the
grand
jury.
if
that
occurs,
then
the
government
is
not
entitled
to
put
a
man
to
trial.
and
therefore,
the
government
cannot
depend
on
merger
for
harmless
error
analysis
when
it's
not
even
entitled
to
the
subsequent
proceeding
on
which
it
depends
for
merger,
that
is,
the
criminal
trial.
mr.
richard
james
braun
yes.
in
justice
o'connor's
concurring
opinion
in
mechanik,
the
court
recognized
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
grand
jury
secrecy
was
to
encourage
full
disclosures
by
witnesses,
participation
by
grand
jurors
and
that
adversely
affecting
the
testimony
of
an
important
witness
could
prejudice
the
grand
jury,
undermine
its
independence,
affect
the
charging
decision.
in
the
case...
in...
in
this
particular
case,
after
the
improper
disclosure,
an
individual
named
leroy
krantz
entered
into
a
plea
agreement
with
the
united
states,
testified
before
the
grand
jury.
the
grand
jury,
at
least
with
respect
to
that
transcript
which
we've
seen,
asked
no
questions
and
was...
and
was
never
asked
a
key
question
in
the
antitrust
case
whether
or
not
there
were...
he
entered
into
any
agreements
with
the...
with
these
defendants,
who
were
later
indicted...
whether
or
not
he
entered
into
agreements
to
rig
bids
or
raise
prices.
subsequently
last
august,
we
took
his
video
tape
deposition
at
the
government's
request,
and
he
testified
he
had
no
such
agreements
with
these
defendants.
the
grand
jury
was
deprived
of
that
testimony,
perhaps
in
part
because
of
the
government's
improper
6(e)
disclosures.
the
district
court
conducted
no
in
camera
review
of
the
grand
jury
transcripts,
gave
the
defendants
no
opportunity
to
show
prejudice.
it
was
a
pre-nova
scotia
case.
mr.
richard
james
braun
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
i
believe
that
under
nova
scotia,
the
error
would
not
be
deemed
harmless
and
could
be
reviewed
post
judgment.
however,
because
a
grand
jury
with
a
lack
of
independence
and
where
the
charging
decision
is
affected,
i
think
the
right
at
issue
here
is
a
right
not
to
be
held
to
answer
at
all
absent
a
valid
indictment
by
a
grand
jury
that's
independent
and
whose
decision
has
not
been
compromised
by
the
improper
breach
of
secrecy
by
the
government.
mr.
richard
james
braun
i
think
one
has
to
weigh.
mr.
richard
james
braun
i
agree
with
that
analysis,
and
one
has
to
weigh
the
value
of
the
right
not
to
be
held
to
answer
except
in
a
valid
indictment
i
think
is
a
very,
very
important
right.
and
i
think
it's
one
akin
to
the
previous
cases
in
which
this
court
has
found
interlocutory
appeal
available,
that
is
in
abney,
the
double
jeopardy
right.
that
too
could
be
reviewed
after
a
trial.
vasquez,
the
discriminatory
selection
of
grand
jurors...
that
case
involved
a
post-trial
review.
but
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
this
court
would
entertain
an
interlocutory
review
of
that
issue.
the
speech
and
debate
clause
issue
under
heistoski
could
certainly
be
reviewed
post
trial,
but
the
right
is
considered
important
enough
to
grant
it
interlocutory
review.
and
i
think
the
fifth
amendment
right
to
be
held
to
answer
only
upon
the
indictment
of...
of...
of
an
independent
and
uncompromised
grand
jury
is
a
right
equally,
if
not
more,
important.
mr.
richard
james
braun
that...
that
is...
that
is
correct,
justice.
mr.
richard
james
braun
yes,
justice,
because
that
right
to
an
independent
and
unbiased
grand
jury
is
so
important
that
the
value
of
the
right
of...
that
is,
a
right
not
to
be
tried
except
upon
a
valid
indictment
is
too
important.
that
right
is
denied
if...
if
it
cannot
be
heard
until
post-conviction
review.
mr.
richard
james
braun
the
procedural
rule
violation...
that's
correct,
your
honor...
creates
a
constitutional
violation.
mr.
richard
james
braun
because
if...
if
the
disclosures
made
by
the
government
in
violation
of
the
rule
undermine
the
independence
of
the
grand
jury,
then
you
don't
have
a
valid
indictment
on
which
the
government
can
require--
mr.
richard
james
braun
--two
cases,
dionisio,
which
states
that
the--
mr.
richard
james
braun
--yes,
it
is...
it
is--
mr.
richard
james
braun
--dicta.
it
is
dicta
in
that...
and
in
fact,
in
both
cases,
stirone
and
dionisio,
it...
it
is
dicta,
not
the
court's
holding.
there
are
two
courts
of
appeals
decisions,
again
both
dicta
and
not
holding,
that
i
think
is
implicit
in
this
court's
holding
in
nova
scotia
that
the
error...
if
the
grand
jury's
charging
decision
is
affected
by
the
government
misconduct,
be
it
rule
6(e)
or
some
other
type
of
misconduct...
if
the
grand
jury's
decision
is
affected
by
the
misconduct
and
thus
the
grand
jury's
independence
has
been
infringed,
the...
that
conduct
can
never
been
deemed
harmless.
mr.
richard
james
braun
i
don't
think
it
invariably
amounts
to
a
constitutional
violation.
i
think
it
amounts
to
a
constitutional
violation
only
where
the
impact
of
the
violation
essentially
compromises
the
grand
jury's
independence.
and
i
would
concede
that
not
every
independent
individual
violation
does
of
rule
6(e),
but
the
cumulative
effect
of
those
violations
does.
for
example,
in
1980
the
general
accounting
office
report
of
the
comptroller
general...
more
supervision
and
guidance
needed
over
the
grand
jury...
found
492
violations
of
grand
jury
secrecy
which
adversely
affected
one
or
more
of
the
purposes
of
grand
jury
secrecy.
of
those
492,
328
were
in
the
last
two-year
period
of
the
study,
1978
and
1979.
and
85
of
those
were
attributable
to
the
government
or
the...
or
government
agents.
so,
unlike
the
setting
in
nova
scotia,
there
is
a
substantial
history
here
of...
of
government
disclosures
of...
6(e)
material.
and
i
think
it
is
becoming
a
much
more
serious
problem.
the
second
circuit
has
recognized
the
growing
nature
of
that
problem
in
a
case
called
u.s.
v.
flanagan.
a
district
court
within
the
second
circuit
in...
i
believe
it's
in
re
archilada...
yes...
432
f.
supp.
583
at
599...
has
decried
the
growing
number
of
breaches
of
grand
jury
secrecy
by
the
government
and...
and...
and...
and
complained
in
an
opinion
that
all
it
could
do
is
gnash
its
judicial
teeth.
so,
i
think
there
is
a
growing
number
of
these
violations
that
are
becoming
a
problem,
and
the
cumulative
effect
of
them
can
certainly
do
no
more
than
to
undermine
the
independence
of...
of
the
grand
jury.
mr.
richard
james
braun
i...
i
agree
that
we're
not
talking
about
a
tremendously
large
number
of
cases,
but
we're
not
talking
about
a
relatively
large
number
of
cases
in
the
abney
double
jeopardy
situation,
in
the
heistoski
speech
and
debate
issue.
we're
talking
about
a
limited
number
of
cases
where
the
right...
that
is,
the
right...
in
this
case,
the
right
to
an
independent,
unbiased
grand
jury...
has
been
compromised
certainly
by
not
all
of
the
government's
violations
of
6(e),
but
by...
but
by
a
number
whose
significance
certainly
matches
the
significance
in
abney
and...
and
in
helstoski.
and
i
think
for
that
reason,
the
importance
of
the
right
and
the
fact
that,
yeah,
we're
not
opening
the
flood
gates
to
an
interminable
number
of
appeals,
that
the
right
at
issue...
that
is,
the
right
to
indictment
only
on
the...
on
an
independent
and
unbiased
grand
jury
and
the
importance
of
maintaining
that
institution
as
a
shield
between
the
government
and
a
potential
accused...
is
important
enough
to
justify
interlocutory
review.
the
particular
violation
in
this
case
was
not
as...
as
egregious
as
the
violations
in
a
lot
of
other
cases
such
as
lance
in
the
fifth
circuit,
eisenberg
in
the
eleventh
circuit.
there's
the
helmsley
case
that's
on
this
court's
docket
raising
the
same
issue
where
i
believe
the
6(e)
violations
are
far
more
egregious
and
are
far
more
likely
to
affect
and
impact
the
grand
jury's
charging
decision
than
the
violation
in
this
case.
nevertheless,
those
violations
do
have
the
capacity
to
undermine
the
independence
of
the
grand
jury.
and
there
has
to
be
some
opportunity
to
inquire
into
that
because
if
the
grand
jury's
decision
to
indict
is
undermined
and
its
grand
jury...
and
its
independence
is
undermined,
then
the
government
doesn't
have
a
right
to
make
a
person
stand
trial.
mr.
richard
james
braun
for
two
reasons.
one,
the
grand
jurors
may
be
reluctant
to
ask
their
own
independent
questions
of
witnesses
for
fear
that...
that
those
portions
may
become
public,
and
they
might
be
held
up
to
ridicule
or...
or
some
type
of
public
criticism.
secondly,
witnesses
whose
names
or
testimony
are
going
to
be
released
improperly
by
the
government
may
not
provide
full
and
untrammeled
disclosures
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
richard
james
braun
i
believe...
i...
i
believe
it
does.
you
know,
i
believe
that
if
you
don't
have
an
active,
independent,
questioning
grand
jury,
then
it
has
got
to
become
more
dependent
upon
the
prosecutor,
that
is,
the
government.
and
i
think
that
this
court's
previous
decisions
in...
in
cases
like
douglas
oll
where
there
have
been
attempts
to
get
disclosure
of
grand
jury
transcripts,
this
court
has
emphasized
over
and
over
again
the
importance
of
secrecy
to
the...
to
the
grand
jury's
independence,
and
particularly
the
pittsburg
plate
glass
case
that...
where...
where
the
court
stated
that
secrecy
was
indispensable
to
the
independence
of
the
grand
jury.
mr.
richard
james
braun
yes,
justice,
i
do.
i
think
that
there
are
some
cases
where
the...
where
the
nature
of
the
violation
is...
is
serious
enough--
mr.
richard
james
braun
--no.
i...
i
believe
that
the
error
would
be
reviewable
on
appeal
after
conviction,
but
then
the
right--
mr.
richard
james
braun
--of
which
the
defendant
is
deprived,
that
is,
the
right
not
to
be
held
to
answer,
which
is
the
fifth
amendment
right
guaranteed
him
under
the
fifth
amendment--
mr.
richard
james
braun
--is
already
gone.
mr.
richard
james
braun
no,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
harmless.
under
this
court's
opinion
in...
in
nova
scotia,
the...
the
inquiry
would...
would
be--
mr.
richard
james
braun
--if
one
could
prove
that
the
grand
jury's
charging
decision
was
impacted
by
the
violation.
i
believe
that
nova
scotia
says
that
that
error
could
be
reviewed
post
conviction
and
wouldn't...
could
not
be
deemed
harmless.
mr.
richard
james
braun
because
the...
because
the...
because
the
right
at
issue
is...
is
a
right
not
to
be
held
to
answer,
not
to
have
to
go
through
the
trial
at
all,
if
the
indictment
is
a
nullity.
in
other
words,
if...
if
you
have
an
indictment
that's
really
the
indictment
of
the
prosecutor...
take
a
situation
that
doesn't
involve
6(e),
but
like
gaither.
mr.
richard
james
braun
i...
i
think
that
sometimes
that's
going
to
be
true.
i
think
sometimes
it's
going
to
be
very,
very
difficult
for
the
defense
to
prove
that
there
was
a...
that
the
violation
had
an
impact
on
the--
mr.
richard
james
braun
--no,
i
think--
mr.
richard
james
braun
--no.
i...
i
think
there's
an
obligation
to
show
prejudice
and
show
an
impact
on
the
charging
decision.
mr.
richard
james
braun
no,
not
on
that
standing
alone.
i
think
that
if...
if
the
violation
impacts
on
the
charging
decision,
that
cannot
be
deemed
harmless.
i
think
the
defendant
is
entitled
not
to
be
held
to
answer.
mr.
richard
james
braun
on...
on
the
basis
that
this
was
raised
pretrial
and
mechanik
was
not
raised
until
mid-trial.
mr.
richard
james
braun
that's...
that's
correct,
your
honor,
so
that
the
right
at
issue
in
our
case
is
the
right
not
to
have
to
stand
trial
at
all
where
mechanik
had
already
stood
trial.
and
this
court
observed
in
its
opinion
that
the
moving
finger
read
and
having
read,
moves
on.
mr.
richard
james
braun
yes.
i
think
this
case
is
governed
by
nova
scotia,
not
mechanik--
mr.
richard
james
braun
--there's
an
invalid
indictment
only
if
there's
prejudice.
there
was
no
prejudice
in...
the
court
found
no
prejudice
in
mechanik.
and
if
i
may
reserve--
mr.
richard
james
braun
--and
i
think
that
to
the
extent
that
the
nova...
i
think
nova
scotia
changes
that
rule.
mr.
richard
james
braun
yes,
it...
it
did.
in
the
last
paragraph
it
said
that
the...
that
what
had
to
be
reviewed
was
the
impact
on
the
grand
jury's
charging
decision
and
that
it
could
never
be
deemed
harmless.
in
nova
scotia,
the
court
accepted
the
court
of
appeals'
findings
that
there
was
no
prejudice.
and
if
i
may
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
james
braun
the
government
has
indicated
that
it
had
some
question
about
whether
or
not
there
was
a
6(e)
violation
in
the
first
place.
let
me
address
that
issue.
prior
to
the
time
of
indictment,
midland
and
litteer
filed
some
grand
jury
motions.
there's
an
affidavit
in
the
file
that
shows
that
we
were
personally
assured
by
the
clerk
that
those
motions
would
be
filed
under
6(e).
rule
6(e)(6)
required
them
to
be
kept
under
6(e).
the
government
responded
to
those
motions,
and
they're
all
marked
in
re
antitrust
grand
jury.
and
that
was
filed
with
the
clerk.
the
clerk
gave
it
a
civil
number.
some
clerks
around
the
country
give
them
civil
numbers,
other
give
them
miscellaneous
number
for
matters
related
to
the
grand
jury.
then
the
grand
jury
returned
an
indictment
against
another
person.
in
responding
to
a
motion
in
that
criminal
case,
the
government
attached
to
that
publicly
filed
motion
in
a
criminal
case
its
response
to
our
grand
jury
motions
pre-indictment.
six
months
later
the
same
grand
jury
indicted
the...
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
what
the
government
had
filed
in
response
to
our
grand
jury
motions
in
the
publicly
filed
criminal
case
revealed
the
nature
and
extent
of
the
grand
jury
investigation,
the
names
of
witnesses,
and
so
forth.
i
don't
think
there
can
be
any
serious
question
that
that
violated
6(e).
item
number
two,
the
government
assumed
that,
for
example,
the
purpose
of
6(e),
free
and
untrammeled
disclosures
by
witnesses,
is
all
in
favor
of
the
government,
that
it
cannot
favor
the
defense,
that
it
can't
favor
a
target.
a
target,
a
subject
of
the
grand
jury,
has
just
as
great
an
interest
in
free
and
untrammeled
disclosures,
which
are
protected
by
6(e),
as
the
government
does
because
sometimes
those
free
and
untrammeled
disclosures,
as
in
the
earl
of
shaftesbury
case,
as
in
the
trial
of
stephen
college
at
oxford
going
back
to
1681,
exonerated
a
potential
accused
or...
or
target.
and...
and
so,
a
person
under
investigation
by
the
grand
jury
has
that
same
interest
and
can
be
just
as
prejudiced
by
persons
because
of
grand
jury
leaks
by
the
government
are
discouraged
from
making
full
and
complete
disclosures.
thirdly,
if
the
grand
jury
is
to
be
effective
in
its
constitutional
right
as
a
shield--
