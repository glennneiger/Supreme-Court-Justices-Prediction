justice

is
there
a
statute
that
we're
dealing
with
here?
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
provision
are
we
talking
about?
i
mean,
you've
been
talking
for
half
of
your
time
now
and
i
don't
even
know
what
statutory
standard
is
supposed
to
be
met
or
not.
what
language
of
the
statute
are
we
talking
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
are
they
in
the
materials
we
have?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
we
know
that?
what
is
minor
and
major
a
shorthand
for
in
the
statute?
the
statute
doesn't
say
major
or
minor,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
really
would
like
to
know
what
language
of
the
act
we're
talking
about
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
language
of
the
act
is
equivalent
to
a
major
dispute?
what
language
of
the
act
is
equivalent
to
a
minor
dispute?
that
will
help
me
to
understand
what
major
and
minor
is
supposed
to
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
the
basis
for
this
distinction?
what
statutory
language
was
the
basis
for
this
distinction?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
the
operative
language?
justice
antonin
scalia
where...
where
is
that
found
in
your
joint
appendix?
justice
antonin
scalia
no
particular
phrase
or
clause?
just...
just
from
the
whole...
i
mean,
it
goes
on
for
a
number
of
pages...
and
one
reads
all
of
that
and
gets
a
notion
of
minor
dispute?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
morikawa,
i
know
you
haven't
wanted
to
talk
about
this.
but
if
you're
going
to
talk
about
it,
i
would
think
you
would
want
to
emphasize
the
phrase
"as
embodied
in
agreements".
it's
not
just
changes
in
rates
of
pay,
rules,
or
working
conditions
of
employees
as
a
class.
but
it's
changes
of
pay...
in
rates
of
pay,
rules,
or
working
conditions
as
embodied
in
agreements.
and
i
suppose
your
argument
is
that
unless
the
agreement
specifically
provides
for
something
which
the
employer
wants
to
change
then
it's
a
minor
dispute.
if
he
wants
to
change
the
actual
specific
provision
of
the
agreement,
then
you
need
a
new
agreement
and
that
goes
to
the
major
bargaining
provisions
of
the
act.
isn't
that
the
language
that's
crucial
for
you?
as
embodied
in
agreements?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
clarke,
now
you've
really
confused
me.
you...
you
say
if
it
comes
within
(i),
it
is
typically
a
minor
dispute?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that
minor
dispute
was
shorthand
for
its
coming
within
(i).
that
it
had
no
other
meaning
except
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
statute
doesn't
even
use
minor
dispute
or
major
dispute.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
that's
how
the
courts
have
been
using
them,
certainly,
as
synonymous
with
what
comes
within
(i).
justice
antonin
scalia
if
all
you
mean
to
say
is
that
what's
a
minor
dispute
may
be
a
big
deal,
that's
fine
with
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
all
the
courts
have
done
is
to...
is
to
give
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
to
the...
to
the
least
severe
mechanism.
what...
what
we're
arguing
about
here
is
whether
this
particular
change
is
a
change
in
the
rates
of
pay,
rules,
or
working
conditions
as
embodied
in
the
agreement
under
part
7.
justice
antonin
scalia
or,
rather,
whether
it's
a
change
arising
out
of
the
interpretation
or
application
of
the
agreement.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
seems
to
me
what
the
courts
have
said
is
that
if
there
is
any
doubt
it,
if
it's
arguable,
we'll
consider
that
what
we're
arguing
about
is
the
interpretation
of
the
agreement
rather
than
a
change
in
the
agreement.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
isn't
that
reasonable?
justice
antonin
scalia
sure.
of
course.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
a
change,
however,
if
the
agreement
is
interpreted
one
way.
and
it
is
a
change
if
it's
interpreted
another
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
not
what
2
seventh
says.
it
does
not
say
all
changes.
it
says
all
changes
in
working
conditions
as
embodied
in
agreements.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
a
railroad
decides
that
it's
going
to
open
its
locker
room
15
minutes
later
than
it
used
to,
that's
a
change.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
to
go
through
the
massive--
justice
antonin
scalia
--negotiations
procedures--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
that?
why
not?
because
the
agreement
didn't
say
anything
about
that
particular
subject
and,
therefore,
it's
a
change
in
the
working
conditions
but
not
a
change
in
working
conditions
as
embodied
in
the
agreement.
so,
what's
always
at
issue
under
2
seventh
is
whether
it's
a
change
in
what
had
been
agreed
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
have
to
get
to
the
issue
of
whether
it's
arguable
that
this
was
agreed
to
or
not.
not
just
whether
it's
arguable
that
this
is
a
change.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
reading
the
statute.
it
says
working
conditions
as
embodied
in
agreements.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
which
case
is,
is
this
a
change
in
something
that's
been
agreed
to.
and
if
it
arguably
is
a
change
in
something
that's
agreed
to,
it's
major...
minor
if
it
is
clear
that
nothing
that's
been
agreed
to
is
being
changed
here,
you
don't
have
to
go
through
a
major
renegotiation
of
the
contract.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
my
locker
room
example
covered
by
your
theory?
why
don't
you
have
to
go
through
a
major
renegotiation
for
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
affects
working
conditions,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's...
that's
my
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
you
put
the
stress
in,
as
embodied
in
an
agreement,
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
other
side's
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
happens,
again,
with
my
locker
room
example
where
they
just
want
to
open
the
locker
room
15
minutes
later?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
change.
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
change
within
the
scope
of
changes
that
i
think
the
agreement
allows
the
employer
to
implement.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
anything
written
in
this
agreement
about...
about
medical...
medical
inspections?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
just
a
practice,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
why--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
say
it's
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no?
