mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case,
although
it
arises
in
a
sense
out
of
a
drug
testing
problem,
is
not
really
a
drug
testing
case.
that's
just
the
facts
in
it.
the
real
issue
in
this
case
is
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
to
enforce
the
specific
commands
of
the
railway
labor
act.
now,
going
to
those
specific
commands
and
what
are
involved
here,
we
submit
the
first
and
most
crucial
command
that's
involved
is
section
2
first
of
the
act,
that
the
carriers
exert
every
reasonable
effort
to
make
and
maintain
agreements
and
to
settle
all
disputes.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
2
first,
your
honor,
is
at
page
131
of
the
joint
appendix.
the
crucial
phrase
in
that
is
to
exert
every
reasonable
effort.
the
second
issue,
or
the
second
statutory
provision
that's
involved,
is
section
2
seventh
of
the
acts
which
was
added
in
the
1934
act.
2
first
was
a
part
of
the
original
1926
act,
and
it
has
remained
unchanged
since
that
act
was
enacted.
2
seventh
was
added
in
1934
and
it
was
added,
according
to
its
legislative
history,
to
emphasize
the
intent
of
two
first
and
6
that
no
change
shall
be
made
in
rates
of
pay,
rules,
or
working
conditions
as
embodied
in
an
agreements,
except
in
the
manner
prescribed
in
the
agreement
or
in
the
manner
prescribed
in
section
6.
that
was,
according
to
the
legislative
history...
which
you
can
go
back
to
the
bankruptcy
act
of
'33
and
the
emergency
transportation
act
of
'33,
where
this
provision
came
from...
the
intent
of
that
provision
was
to
stop
practices
that
had
been
going
on
where
the
carriers
had
been
by
bulletin
suddenly
changing
the
actual
working
conditions
of
the
employees,
claiming
that
they
weren't
in
violation
of
the
agreement,
but
just
making
the
change.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
next
statutory
provision
that's
involved
in
this
case
is
3
first
(1)
of
the
statute.
3
first
(1)
is
located
at
page
142.
and
what...
excuse
me?
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
on
page
142...
(1)...
you
go
back
into
the
indentation
again.
it's
right
at
the
very
bottom.
and
in
the
middle
of
that
paragraph
what
it
basically...
well,
up
in
the
early
part...
what
it
says
is
that
disputes
between
an
employee
or
group
of
employees
and
the
carrier
growing
out
of
grievances
or
out
of
the
interpretation
or
application
of
agreements
concerning
rates
of
pay,
rules,
and
working
conditions
are
to
be
handled
on
the
property
up
to
the
usual
manner.
and
then,
if
still
unresolved,
may
be
referred
by
either
party
to
an
adjustment
board.
now,
a
crucial
factor
of
this
particular
section
is
that
this
is
very
unique,
for
this
reason.
in
the
railway
labor
act
both
the
employer
and
the
employees
can
refer
a
dispute
over
the
interpretation
or
application
of
an
agreement
to
the
dispute
resolution
grievance
procedure,
the
adjustment
board
process,
the
arbitration
found...
that
you
have
under
the
nlra.
and
the
nlra,
it's
normally...
sometimes
limited
to
just
the
employees.
but
in
the
railway
labor
act,
from
the
very
beginning...
and
this
was
a
provision
that
started
in
1926
and
actually
predates
that,
as
we
explained
it
in
our
brief...
it
goes
back
to
the
railroad's
control
by
the
federal
government
in
1918.
both
parties
to
the
dispute,
if
they
are
unsatisfied
with
the
results
on
the
property
can
have
an
outside
force
take
a
look
at
it
and
determine
what
the
real
meaning
of
the
contract
is.
now,
the
next
provision
that's
involved
in
this
case--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--your
honor,
this
is
the
tricky
question
in
this
whole
case,
what
is
major
and
minor.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
that
is--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--your
honor,
it
refers
simply
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board
to
determine...
adjustment
board
to
determine
the
interpretation
of
a
contract.
that
is
typically
a--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--minor
dispute.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
the
adjustment
board's
sole
role,
your
honor,
is
to
determine
what
the
contract
means.
it
doesn't
determine
whether
a
dispute
is
major
or
minor.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
that's
the
problem
that's
arisen.
that
was
not
the
intent
of
the
statute
but--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
those
terms
were
used,
and
they
were
common
terms
in
the
industry
in
the
1920s
and
in
1934
when
the
act
was
amended.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
what
point--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
i'm
not
saying--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--the
colloquial
use
of
the
terms
back
in
the
time
the
act
was
amended
in
'34
when
the
adjustment
board
process
was
set
up
and
it
was
given
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
interpretation
of
contracts
was
that
that
would
deal
with
what
were
known
in
the
industries
as
minor
disputes.
what
has
happened
since
1934
is
the
courts
have
said
if
you
have
an
interpretation
issue
involved
in
a
dispute,
it's
a
minor
dispute.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
exclusively.
and
that's
the
problem.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
if
it
involves...
a
major
dispute
involves
a
change.
and
the
point
that
we're
trying
to
emphasize
here,
your
honor,--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--is
that
a
change
can
carry
with
it
a
dispute
over
the
interpretation
of
a
contract.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
your
honor,
not
a
change.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
one--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--the
one
dispute
i
have
of
what
you
said
is
that
if
it's
a
change
arising
out
of
the
interpretation
or
application
of
an
agreement
it's
a
minor
dispute...
that's
not
what
the
statute
says.
the
difference
is
this:
if
it's
a
change,
unless
it
is
authorized
by
the
agreement,
it
is
prohibited
by
the
statute.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
now--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--your
honor,
that
gets
into
the
question
of
when
you
have
a
dispute
over
whether
you
have
a
change.
that
is
not
what
we're
dealing
with
here.
in
this
case
there
is
without
a
doubt
a
change.
now,--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--your
honor,
the
record
is
a--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--a
finding
of
fact.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
your
honor,
i
don't
think
they
agree,
but
the
records...
the
finding
of
fact
below,
which
is
unassailable
here,
is
that
it
is
a
change.
so,--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--your
honor,
the
arguable
standard
is
a
good
test
of
the
court's
jurisdiction
where
you
have
a
question
as
to
whether
there
is
a
change.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
but
once
you--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--that...
that's
contrary
to
the
intent
of
the
drafters
of
the
act
as
to
what
they
meant
by
change.
they--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
what--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--what
i'm
saying
is
that
if
there
is
a
change,
what
the
courts
have
to
do
is
to
enforce
the
status
quo
obligation
that
the
act
carries
with
it.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
your
honor,
there
is...
the
act--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
but
the
point
that
i'm
getting
at
on
change
is
the
change
that
the
statute
used
is
the
literal
broad
meaning
of
the
word
change
and
not
the
meaning
of
the
word
change
in
that
it's
something
that
is
authorized
by
a
contract.
and
that's...
you
take
a
look
at
2
seventh
and
it
brings
it
out
in
this
sense.
if
2
seventh
means
that
if
you
have
a
dispute
over
whether
or
not
there
is
a
change
in
what's
going
on,
and
whether
that
change
is
authorized,
the
dispute
is
basically
this.
i
say
i'm
authorized
by
the
agreement
to
do
it
so,
therefore,
i'm
not
changing
it.
you
say
i'm
not
authorized
by
the
agreement
so,
therefore,
it's
a
change.
we
have
a
dispute
as
to
whether
there
is
a
change.
if
that's
what
2
seventh
means,
then
the
language,
except
in
the
manner
prescribed
in
the
agreement,
means
nothing.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
it's
not,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
it
didn't
come
from
that.
it
came
basically
in
the...
it
first
started
to
prop
up
as
plausible
and
then
arguable
in
the
'60s.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
it
comes
basically
from--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--the
nlra
concept
of
clear
and
patent
breach.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
this
court
has
never
used
that
term.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
arguable.
it
has
never...
this
court
has
never
addressed
the
issue
except
tangentially
in
the
chicago
and
northwestern
case
as
to
a
classification
of
a
dispute
as
major
or
minor.
in
chicago
and
northwestern
there
was
a
moratorium
clause
specifically
prohibiting
a
bargaining
section
6
notice.
the
carrier
claimed
that
the
bargaining
notice
was
prohibited
by
the
moratorium
clause,
which
said
that
no
notice
on
that
subject
would
be
served
for
this
period
of
time.
and
then
they
argued
that
since
the
question
of
whether
our
interpretation
of
the
moratorium
clause
is
correct,
there
is
no
obligation
to
bargain
over
the
notice.
this
court
rejected
that
by
saying
only
one
word
need
be
said
about
that.
it's...
it's
impossible
to
talk
about
a
proposal
to
change
an
agreement
as
not
being
what
was
covered
by
section
6.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
the
change
in
this
case
was...
there
are
two
sets
of
rules
that
apply.
the
medical
fitness
standards
which
the
courts
below
found
are
in
fact
an
implied
agreement.
so
we're...
this
is
an
agreement
case.
secondly,
as
rule
g,
one
the
manner
in
which
rule
g
has
been
enforced,
the
implied
agreement
that
the
record
shows
exist
is
that
rule
g
is
enforced
solely
by
sensory
observations
of
the
supervisors
and
by
particularized
cause.
that
goes
into
the
question
of
the
doctor
and
the
doctor's
taking
of
the
test.
the
difference
between
the
two...
and
this
is
where
the
change
comes
in...
is
this.
under
medical
fitness
when
someone
is
disqualified
for
medical
fitness
purposes,
they
are
held
out
of
service
until
the
medical
fitness
problem
dissipates
or
is
cured
or
is
somehow
corrected.
under
rule
g,
if
you
are
found
guilty
of
violating
rule
g
which
simply
prohibits
the
use
of
drugs
or
hallucinogens,
alcohol
or
hallucinogens,
while
on
duty
or
while
subject
to
call,
you
are
subject
to
discipline,
which
includes
being
fired.
medical
fitness
never
had
discipline
involved
in
it.
under
this
standard,
we
now
have
45
days
to
test
negative
or
you're
discharged.
no
other
medical
fitness
problem
is
treated
in
that
way.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
your
honor,
there
is
nothing--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--your
honor,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
on
that.
we
would
submit
that
discipline
cannot
be
enforced
by
that.
you
can't
rule--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--they
discipline
employees
who
fall
to
show
up
for...
to
take
an
exam,
to
come
in
for
a
routine
physical
or
some
kind
of
scheduled
exam.
that's
accepted
practice.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
and
they
fall
to
come
in...
they
are
then
disciplined
for
not
complying
with
carrier
instruction.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
your
honor,
we
submit
no.
they
can't
be
returned
to
duty
until
they
comply
with
the
instructions.
there
is
a
set
procedure
of
another...
outside
doctor's
opinion,
and
then
an
arbitration
if
you
have
a
dispute
over
whether
the
standards
and
stuff
are
proper.
but
the
point
is,
we
submit
the
person
cannot
be
disciplined
in
that
type
of
situation
because
what
is
happening
is
that
the
medical
standard
is
that
you're
taken
out
of
service
until
you're
cured.
what
is
going
on
is
a
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
any
insubordination.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
they're
mainly
in
the
contracts,
your
honor.
there
are
procedures
for
outside
doctors
for
getting
a
second
opinion.
and
then
the...
if
there
is
a
dispute,
there's
an
arbitration
process.
there's--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
those
are
the
medical
fitness
policies
that
the
company
establishes.
and
they
have--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--historically
been
established
by
prohibition.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
we
submit,
your
honor,
that
there
is
a...
that
if
there
is
a
dispute
over
a...
whether
there
is
a
change,
the...
that
dispute,
if
the
carrier's
position
that
what
it
is
doing
is
not
a
change
is
arguable...
in
other
words,
that
the
union's
position--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--arguable--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--the
court
makes
that
threshold
determination.
now,
that
is
what
has
been
the
standard
in--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--your
honor,
this
is
the
problem
that
we
have.
the
fact
that
something
is
labeled
as
a
major
dispute
doesn't
eliminate
the
jurisdiction
of
the
adjustment
board
to
resolve
the
contract
interpretation
issue.
even
a
frivolous
claim,
the
unions
have
the
right
to
present
to
an
adjustment
board.
so,
an
adjustment
board
can
make
the
determination
that
there
is
or
is
not
a
change.
what
is
done
in
the
court
is
not
in
any
way
affecting
the
adjustment
board's
jurisdiction.
now--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--i
do
for
a
limited
type
of
test,
your
honor.
essentially
what
the
union
submits
is
that
you
have
to
look
at
2
seventh
for
the
standard
on
the
court's
jurisdiction.
the
courts
clearly
have
the
jurisdiction
to
enforce
2
first.
they
clearly
have
the
jurisdiction
to
enforce
2
seventh.
now,
2
seventh
said
no
change
shall
be
made
if
there
is
a
dispute
over
whether
or
not
change
is
used
in
the
statute.
and
the
legislative
history
makes
it
clear
that
whether
or
not
a
carrier
claims
a
right
under
a
contract
to
make
the
change
is
not
the
issue
as
to
whether
there
is
a
change.
the
change
that--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--that's
right.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
no.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
not--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--your
honor,
it's
not
whether
there's
a
change
in
what
was
agreed
to.
it's
whether
there
is
a
change
that
is
affecting
what
is...
what
was
agreed
to.
that's
what
the
legislative
history
makes
clear.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
that
was
added
in
1934
at
the
request
of
the
railroads
because
they
indicated
that
working
conditions...
the
conditions
of
employment
are
specifically
established
by
agreement.
now,
the
point--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--your
honor,
there
are
two
aspects
that
are
being
confused
into
one.
there
is
the
question
of
notice.
what
triggers
the
obligation
of
notice.
and
the
second
question
is
what
is
the
status
quo
obligation...
that
is
in
place...
comes
into
place
once
the
notice
obligation
is
triggered.
what
the
legislative
history
shows
is
that
language
means...
and
this
was
added
basically
at
the
request
of
labor...
that
if
the
carrier
is
making
a
change
that
affects
rates
of
pay,
rules,
or
working
conditions
that
are
embodied
in
an
agreement.
the
clearest
example
are
the
line
sales...
even
though
it
might
not
be
prohibited
by
an
agreement,
a
violation
of
the
agreement,
if
what
they
are
doing
changes
the
working
conditions.
and
the
prime
example
of
that
is
the
use
of
the
legislative
history
of
1924
where
mr.
richberg
explained
the
intent
of
this
language.
and
that
was
that
where
they...
the
contracts
at
that
time
had
the
expiration
clauses
that
provided
that
they
died
at
the
end
of
a
year
unless
30
days
prior
to
that
time
notice
of
change
had
been
given.
and
the
purpose
of
the
statute
that
they
were
proposing
back
in
1924,
which
was
enacted
as
2
first
and
2
sixth,
was
that
even
though
the
contract
language
said
this
is...
you
can
change,
you
might
make
all
your
changes,
they
couldn't
do
it
if
what
was
being
done
would
affect
the
rates
of
pay,
rules
and
working
conditions
while
that
bargaining
process
was
going
on.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
because,
your
honor,
whether
or
not
you
report
15
minutes
or
a
half
hour
later
is
not
affecting
the
working
conditions
that
are
embodied
in
the
agreement.
but
where
you
change
the--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--but
not
as
embodied
in
an
agreement.
and
for
that
reason
it
is
not
one
that
requires
notice.
but,
assume
that
you
get--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--right.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
it
is
not,
your
honor,
for
this
reason.
if
you
interpret
something
as
being...
if
there's
a
question
as
to
whether
there
is
a
change
in
the
literal
use
of
that
word
that
the
congress
used,
then
you
do
have
a
question...
we
have
to
interpret
the
agreement
first
to
determine
if
there's
a
change.
but
where
you
clearly
have
a
change
and
the
carrier
comes
back
and
says,
"but
it
is
authorized
by
the
agreement.
"
and
that's
the
point
we're
getting
to
here.
they
recognize
that
there
is
a
new
policy
that
was
implemented.
it's
clear
that
it's
different
than
what
they
did
before.
but
they
are
coming
in
and
saying,
"we
have
the
right
under
our
agreement
with
you
to
make
this
change.
"
so,
the
difference
between
this
case
and
the
other
case,
the
arguable
standard
which
is
the
reverse
of
the
nlra's
clear
and
patent
breach
of
contract
standard,
or
breach...
is
basically
this.
where
you
have
a
dispute
as
to
whether
the
contract
is
being
changed
by
what
they're
doing,
the
adjustment
board
has
the
ability
in
enforcing
the
contract
to
give
complete
relief
to
both
sides.
but
where
the
dispute
is
whether
the
change
is
authorized
by
the
agreement...
not
whether
the
agreement
is
being
interpreted
properly...
if
the
dispute
is
whether
the
change
is
authorized
by
the
agreement,
the
only
thing
the
adjustment
board
can
say
is
that
no,
it's
not,
or
yes,
it
is.
if
the
adjustment
board
says
it
is
not,
then
what
you
have
has
been
a
change
in
working
conditions
that's
not
in
the
manner
prescribed
by
section
6,
not
in
the
manner
prescribed
in
the
agreement.
and
that
is
a
major
dispute.
but,
in
the
meantime,
by
the
standards
that
the
courts
have
been
applying
recently,
adopting
the
arguable
standard
to
this
defense,
defensive
use
of
an
agreement,
is
that
the
status
quo
obligation
has
been
changed.
and
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
get
to
in
all
of
this--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--we
do,
your
honor,
in
the
sense...
to
this
degree.
in
this
case
it's
not
even
arguable
that
there
was
in
fact
an
authorization
to
make
this
change.
but
the
reason
why
we're
presenting
this
standard,
this
view
of
section
2
first
and
sixth
is
that
the
courts
have
combined
the
status
quo
concept
with
the
minor
dispute
concept
and
they've
twisted
things
around.
the
lower
courts
have
twisted
around.
and
when
you
look
at
a
dispute
as
being
all
major
or
all
minor
and
never
the
twain
shall
meet,
what
you
come
up
with
is
you
adulterate
the
act.
the
act
was
intended,
from
the
very
initial
enactment
in
1926,
to
put
a
status
quo
obligation
on
all
disputes.
no
change
shall
be
made
until
the
act's
processes
have
been
completed
is
what
the
intent
of
the
act
was.
in
the
initial
1926
act
minor
disputes
were
also
considered
by
the
congress.
the
only
difference
was
that
minor
disputes
initially
went
to
an
adjustment
board
that
could
be
set
up
by
voluntary
agreement.
and
if
that
adjustment
board
was
able
to
resolve
it,
well,
that
ended
the
problem.
but
if
the
adjustment
board
didn't
resolve
it,
it
went
immediately
back...
if
any
party
requested...
to
the
mediation
process.
and
from
the
mediation
process
to
the
emergency
board
process.
and
during
that
entire
processing
no
party
shall
make
any
change
in
the
conditions
out
of
which
the
dispute
arose.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
that's
the
point
that
we
are
trying
to
make
here.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
well,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
because
there
it
isn't
being
in
a
manner
authorized
by
the
agreement.
but
until
that--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--your
honor,
the
unions
could
also
protest,
but
the
unions'
position
is
that
there
is
no
way
you
could
say
that
the
unions
by
agreeing
to
allow
the
carrier
to
set
medical
fitness
standards
has
ever
agreed
to
allow
the
merger
of
medical
fitness
and
drug
testing.
they
are
two
separate
standards.
in
one
you're
not
fired;
the
other
one
you
are
fired.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
that
is
correct,
except
for
one
problem.
we
are
now
to
this
court,
for
the
first
time,
addressing
the
interplay
between
major
and
minor
disputes.
and
the
point
that
we
have
to
emphasize
to
this
court
is
that
if
the
lower
courts...
and
i
don't
just
mean
the
third
circuit,
but
all
of
the
courts...
standard
is
applied--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
it's
basically
all
of
the...
except
possibly
the
tenth
circuit...
have
adopted
the
arguable
standard.
and
we
have
no
objection
to
the
arguable
standard
where
the
adjustment
board
can
give
complete
relief,
it
can
resolve
the
entire
dispute.
but
where
the
adjustment
board
is
one
step
in
the
resolution
of
the
dispute,
where
if
the
adjustment
board
concludes
that
there
is
no
contract
authorization
for
what
is
going
on...
not
that
it
violates
the
agreement,
it
changed
the
working
conditions
because
you're
taking
away
the
man's
seniority,
but
it
doesn't
violate
it...
then
what
you
have
is
the
adjustment
board
can
say
to
the
employees,
"sorry,
folks,
we
can't
give
you
any
relief
because
you
haven't
gotten
the
contract
which
prohibits
what
they're
doing.
"
the
only
thing
that
prohibits
what
they're
doing
is
the
statute,
and
the
statute's
status
quo
period.
so,
what
that
means,
when
the
adjustment
board
rules
a
couple
of
years
down
the
pike,
is
that
in
the
meantime
all
of
this
was
being
done
in
violation
of
the
statute.
now,
pitney,
when
this
court
addressed
the
concept
of
minor
dispute
and
the
court's
jurisdiction,
the
court
said
that
where
there
is
a
clear
violation
of
the
statute
the
court
should
not
withhold
its
hand.
but
where
there
is
a
question
as
to
whether
there
is
a
violation
of
the
statute
the
court
in
the
exercise
of
its
equity
discretion
should
withhold
its
hand
and
let
the
adjustment
board
resolve
the
case.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
your
honor,--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--it's
not
a
change--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--your
honor,--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--whether
it's
in
the
scope
doesn't
matter.
it's
not
a
change
unless
you
have
an
agreement
dealing
with
the
starting
time
and
the
location.
a
change
of
15
minutes
in
when
you
can
go
in
or
out
is
not
the
type
of
change
that
requires
a
notice.
this
is
the
point
i'm
getting...
there
is
a
difference
between
the
notice
obligation
under
2
seventh
and
the
status
quo--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--there
is
nothing
written
in
the
agreement--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--no.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
no,
it
is
not--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--your
honor.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
that's
why
this
is
a
different
case
than
a
practice
case.
if
this
was
a
practice,
there
would
have
to
be
something
that
would
trigger
the
bargaining
process,
and
that
would
have
to
be
a
change
in
agreements,
in
the
working
relations
that
are
embodied
in
the
agreement.
in
this
case
the
record
below,
according
to
the
courts,
provides
that
there
is
in
fact
an
implied
in
fact
agreement
dealing
with
rule
g,
its
enforcement,
medical
fitness.
so
we
are
now
dealing--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--i'm
sorry.
