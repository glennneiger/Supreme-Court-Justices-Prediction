this...
is
this
pursuant
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
mr.
morikawa?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
it's
based
on
the
language
of
152
seventh
and
153
first.
i
mean,
the
elgin,
joliet,
&
eastern--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--case
didn't
just
go
off
totally--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--into
the
air.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
"what

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--so,
one
of
the
critical
question
is,
is
this
a
change
or
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
about
the
word
arguable?
where
did
the
word
arguable
come
into
rla
jurisprudence?
it's
not
in
the
statute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
it
come
from
elgin,
jollet
&
eastern?
chief
justice
william
h.

where
did
it
prop

william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
courts...

construing

have
used
the
term,
have
they
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
this
term...
court
used
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
term
arguable?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
support
the
use
of
the
word
arguable
then,
don't
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you...
you
don't
support
the
reasoning
of
the
third
circuit
then,
although
it
ruled
in
your
favor?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
clarke.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
