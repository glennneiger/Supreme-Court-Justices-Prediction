mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
issue
today
is
the
right
of
conrail's
medical
department
to
continue
its
longstanding
practice
of
establishing
and
maintaining
the
standards
by
which
its
employees
will
be
deemed
medically
fit
for
duty.
the
standards
have
always
included
conrail's
right
to
require
that
its
employees
submit
to
physical
examinations,
the
purpose
of
which
is
to
determine
these
employees'
fitness
for
duty.
these
examinations
have
routinely
been
required
throughout
conrail's
history
as
part
of
its
regular
business.
the
focal
point
of
this
litigation
then
is
the
addition
by
conrail
of
a
drug
test
to
these
routine
physical
fitness
examinations.
it
is
our
contention
this
morning
that
the
addition
of
that
drug
test
was
at
least
arguably
related
to
the
general
fitness
for
duty
standards
which
conrail
had
the
right
to
maintain,
as
it
had
over
the
years.
and,
as
a
result,
the
challenge
by
the
unions
to
the
addition
of
this
drug
test
to
the
physical
examinations
represented
a
claim
which
should
have
been
resolved
in
the
statutory
adjustment
process
of
arbitration
provided
under
the
railway
labor
act.
we
will
demonstrate
that
the
lower
court
exceeded
the
limited
judicial
role
which
the
courts
play
in
the
process
of
determining
the
proper
forum
in
which
these
disputes
are
to
be
resolved
because
in
this
case,
we
contend,
that
the
lower
court
proceeded
to
decide
the
merits
of
the
underlying
dispute
and
in
that
process
exceeded
that
role
which
the
courts
have
clearly
carved
out
in
determining
whether
minor
disputes
exist
in
this...
under
the
act.
now,
i'd
like
to
take
a
moment
to
examine
conrail's
longstanding
medical
fitness
for
duty
practices
that
have
existed
since
1976,
the
year
when
conrail
was
first
created,
because
we
believe
that
these
facts
amply
demonstrate
the
particular
reasons
why
conrail
contended
in
the
first
place
that
the
addition
of
the
drug
test
was
clearly
related
to
its
fitness
for
duty
determinations.
first
of
all,
since
1976,
at
the
time
conrail
first
came
into
existence,
the
railroad
had
a
medical
department
which
determined
standards
for
employee
fitness.
throughout
the
history
of
conrail
the
medical
department
has
had
the
discretionary
right
to
always
determine
fitness-for-duty
standards,
part
of
that
being
the
inclusion
of
these
kinds
of
physical
examinations.
not--
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
--no,
your
honor,
it
was
not.
it
was
pursuant
to
the
general
policies
that
were
implemented
at
the
time
that
conrail
was
created.
but
it
was
never
bargained
over
with
the
unions.
in
fact,
the
whole
issue
of
medical
fitness-for-duty
standards
has
been
a
subject
which
traditionally
in
the
railroad
industry
has
not
been
a
subject
over
which
the
railroads
and
the
unions
have
bargained.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
the
lower
court
in
this
case
characterized
the
kind
of
drug
testing
that
had
been
done
as
being
done
on
particularized
suspicion.
and,
frankly,
your
honor,
we're
not
quite
clear
what
that
term
really
means
in
the
context
of
a
physical
examination.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
believe
that
if
you
look
into
the
practices
of
the
parties
that
did
exist,
it
included
not
just
testing
at
the
discretion
of
a
physician,
as
in
that
situation,
but
it
also
included
drug
testing
that
had
been
done
by
conrail
on
a
broader
base
in
1984
when
for
a
period
of
six
months
it
implemented
drug
testing
across
the
board
and
part
of
these
routine
physical
examinations.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
we
contend
that
conrail
had
the
right
to
determine
fitness
for
duty,
as
it
had
been
its
practice.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
the
question
of
whether
or
not
aids
relates
to
fitness
for
duty
is
certainly
problematic.
or
pregnancy,
as
to
whether
that
relates
to
fitness
for
duty.
the
question,
however,
is
that
the
medical
department
has
seen
fit
to
develop
various
standards
over
the
years
which
in
its
judgment
it
felt
appropriate
to
the
question
of
employee
fitness.
as
a
consequence
of
that,
the
medical
department,
we
contend,
has
had
the
right
and
must
continue
to
have
the
right,
based
on
these
practices,
to
be
able
to
respond
to
emerging
threats
to
employee
fitness
for
duty.
and
in
this
particular
situation,
whether
or
not
pregnancy
or
aids
would
represent
a
fitness
for
duty
threat
we
don't
know
at
this
point,
but
we
believe
that
the
medical
department
should
have
that
right
to
make
determinations.
now,
i'd
like
to
continue
on--
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
--it
certainly
did
not,
your
honor.
one
of
the
problems
that
occurred
at
the
chase,
maryland
accident
on
january
4,
1987
was
the
discovery
consequently
by
the
national
transportation
safety
board
that
the
conrail
engineer
and
breakman
involved
in
that
collision
had
been
using
marijuana
just
prior
to
the
accident.
and
i
think
this
highlights
one
of
the
critical
problems
that
we've
had
to
face
with
respect
to
the
drug
issue.
i
think
it
was
quite
well
known
at
the
time
that
when
ricky
gates,
the
engineer
of
that
conrail
engine,
left
the
baltimore
yard
he
was
seen
by
a
trainmaster
who
testified
later
that
ricky
gates
seemed
normal,
did
not
seem
to
have
any
apparent
problem
or
difficulty.
and
yet
15
minutes
later
the
consequential
crash
occurred
in
the
northeast
corridor.
this
highlighted
in
our
minds
the
major
problem
that
we
had
with
respect
to
the
question
of
drugs.
the
difficulty
of
detecting
drugs
and
yet
its
profound
impact
on
employee
fitness
and
on
performance
of
our
employees.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
the
test
that's
involved
in
this
case,
your
honor,
is
a
urine
sample,
not
a
blood
test.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
but
the
urine
sample
was
required
to
be
taken
as
part
of
the
routine
physical
examinations
back
to
1976.
so,
this
test
has
always
been
part
of
the
physical.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
that
is
precisely
correct,
your
honor.
the
only
thing
we
did
in
this
case
was
to
add
another
test
to
the
existing
urine
sample
to
test
for
the
existence
of
drugs
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
to
give
you
one
example,
the
issue
of
cocaine
has
always
been
a
profound
problem
in
the
industry
and
in
the
public
at
large.
only
eight
or
nine
years
ago
magazines
were
touting
the
fact
that
cocaine
was
a
major
new
drug
which
had
come
on
the
scene
and
that
people
could
use
it
and
they
could
use
it
to
their
pleasure
without
worrying
about
the
problems
of
addiction
related
to
cocaine.
seven
or
eight
years
later
now,
we
now
determine
through
the
medical
industry
that
cocaine...
it
may
be
the
most
addictive
drug
in
the
market
today
and
may
represent
the
greatest
threat
to
employee
fitness.
so,
you
see
that
the
whole
concept
of
medicine
and
the
way
it
addresses
certain
kinds
of
problems
constantly
evolves
in
changes.
and
in
our
situation
we
felt
that
it
was
necessary
to
be
able
to
have
the
medical
department
be
in
a
position
to
be
able
to
respond
to
these
kinds
of
changes
in
employee
fitness
questions.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
the
consequences
of
being
determined
unfit
for
duty
are
determined
by
the
past
practices
between
the
parties
in
this
case.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
an
employee
who
was
disqualified
based
on
a
medical
condition
was
disqualified
from
duty
and
was
not
paid
until
that
same
employee
was
requalified
to
go
back
to
duty.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
yes,
your
honor.
that
same
situation
occurs
here.
an
employee
tests
positive
for
drugs,
is
immediately
disqualified,
and
is
not
paid,
similar
to
all
other
conditions.
the
slight
difference
in
this
situation,
however,
is
that
we
have
developed
a
response
to
deal
with
the
question
of
drugs.
one
of
those
responses
is
we
have
devised
a
network
for
providing
drug
counseling
and
assistance
to
employees,
recognizing
the
drug-dependency
problem
that
can
exist--
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
--the
employee
goes
into
the
program.
there
are
two
components
to
the
program,
as
we
have
it.
one
is
the
counseling
program.
the
employees
work
with
drug
counselors,
and
not
a
single
employee
has
ever
been
disciplined
in
that
program
at
all.
the
other
aspect
of
the
program
is
a
45-day
aspect.
and
that
simply
says
this.
if
you
are
not
dependent
upon
drugs,
what
the
medical
department
says
is:
if
you
have
drugs
in
your
system,
we
don't
want
you
coming
back
to
duty.
so,
the
45-day
period
was
addressed
by
the
medical
department
recognizing
the
fact
that
drugs
potentially
could
stay
in
a
person's
system
for
up
to
45
days.
the
employee
in
this
situation
who
tests
positive
can
test
as
many
times
as
he
or
she
wants
to
do
in
the
45-day
period.
if
they
test
negative,
they
go
back
to
work.
if
they
test
positive,
nothing
happens.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
the
end
of
the
45-day
period
could
occur
conceivably
in
which
an
employee
refuses
to
test
negative
for
the
existence
of
drugs.
and
under
those
circumstances
the
employee
has
in
our
view
taken
choice.
that
is,
he
said
that
he
is
not
going
to
provide
a
urine
sample
that
is
clean
of
drugs
in
order
to
go
back
to--
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
--another
aspect
of
the
program
is
this--
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
--there
is
a
point
in
this
process
in
which
an
employee
who
is
unable...
who
does
not
provide
a
clean
urine
sample
can
be
dismissed.
but
we
contend
that--
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
--employees
have
for
years
been
required
by
the
medical
department
to
comply
with
its
rules
and
regulations
and
instructions.
and
employees
have
in
the
past,
for
example,
been
disciplined
or
dismissed
for
falling
to
show
up
for
a
physical
examination.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
that
employee
would-probably
be
treated
by
the
medical
department
given
the
fact
that
that
was
a
physical
condition
that
was
affecting
that
employee.
i
think
the
comparison,
your
honor,
if
i
can
make
that,
is
this.
employees
who
have
an
affliction...
that
is,
are
drug-dependent...
are
the
real
core
of
employees
to
be
compared
to
the
employees
who
are
suffering
from
physical
problems
and
maladies.
as
to
those
employees,
our
program
provides
assistance,
counseling,
and
treatment.
as
to
employees
who
say
they
are
not
drug-dependent,
our
contention
is
that
these
employees
are
being
told
by
the
medical
department
simply
to
stop
using
drugs.
that's
a
voluntary
act
on
the
part
of
the
employee.
he
or
she
has
a
choice,
to
get
the
drugs
out
of
their
system
or
not
go
to
work
under
the
circumstances.
so,
the
volitional
and
non-volitional
side
of
drugs
is
the
way
that
this
has
been
reflected
in
the
program.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
well,
certainly,
our
contention
in
this
case
is
that
the
purpose
of
this
program...
and,
in
fact,
the
practical
effect
of
this
program,
has
not
been
disciplinary
at
all.
unfortunately,
what
the
court
did
in
this
case--
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
--we
certainly
are
trying
to
prevent
employees
from
using
drugs
in
the
industry
because
we
believe
it
affects
fitness.
but
the
problem
we
see
here
is
that
in
determining
the
existence
of
the
minor
dispute
in
this
case
by
determining
the
practical
impact,
the
court
in
this
case
went
beyond
its
limited
role.
it
determined
that
because
the
impact...
potentially...
of
the
use
of
drugs
was
different
than
it
conceived
the
prior
impact
of
other
physical
conditions,
that
this
would
change
the
question
of
whether
or
not
conrail's
position
was
even
arguable.
i
think
that's
the
important
focal
point
of
this
case.
what
we
are
contending
in
this
case
is--
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
--the
railway
labor
act,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
the
statutory
language
we're
discussing
is
contained
in
two
sections
of
the
act,
section
27
and
section
6
of
the
act.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
they
are
at
the
end
of
the
materials
in
your
materials,
at
page...
beginning
at
page
131
is
a
list
of
the
provisions
of
the
act.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
of
the
joint
appendix.
the
section
2
seventh
is
contained
at
page
134
of
the
joint
appendix
and
provides,
"no
carrier,
its
officers
or
agents
shall
change
the
rates
of
pay,
rules,
or
working
conditions
of
its
employees,
as
a
class
as
embodied
in
agreements
except
in
the
manner
prescribed
in
such
agreements
in
section
156.
"
which
is
section
6
of
the
act.
requiring--
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
--the
question
of
minor
dispute,
your
honor,
is
not
found
in
the
act
per
se.
implicit
in
the
act--
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
--that
is
correct.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
that's
correct.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
that's
correct.
yes.
the
court...
forgive
me.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
we
contend
that
the
disputes
regarding
the
right
of
conrail
to
add
drug
tests,
or
the
particular
details
of
the
effect
that
the
drug
may
have
on
particular
employees
are
matters
for
arbitration.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
they
are
minor
disputes.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
they
were
major.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
the
district
court
concluded
it
was
a
minor
dispute.
what
the
district
court
did
in
this
case...
and
i
think
this
is
a
good
place
to
focus
on
what
the
court
did...
the
district
court
looked
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
of
the
past
practice
and
they
focused
on
the
precise
issue
that
we
began
with
today.
they
looked
at
conrail's
ongoing
practice--
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
--they
attempt
to
examine
whether
in
the
past
practices
of
the
parties
the
change
that
is
being
sought
here
has
any
plausible
relationship
to--
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
--it
conceivably
can.
in
fact,
the
whole
question
is
if
the
dispute
is
over
an
agreement
or
a
past
practice,
then
it
is
a
minor
dispute
because
that's
your
classic
issue
that
goes
to
arbitration.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
in
section
3
of
the
act,
justice
scalia,
our
provision--
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
--okay.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
okay.
your
honor,
the
language
of
the
act
pertaining
to
major
and
minor
disputes...
there
is
no...
there
is
no
proviso
for
major
and
minor
disputes
in
the
act.
that's
a
court-made
concept.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
correct.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
that's
right.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
the
court
in
elgin
read
into
the
act
two
distinct
kinds
of
matters
or
disputes
that
can
arise.
the
first
being
major
disputes
which
are
disputes
over
new
conditions
in
the
future,
new
agreements.
and
those
are
provisions
which
would
be
governed
by
section
6.
the
other
aspect
of
these
kinds
of
disputes
are
minor
disputes.
the
larger
number
of
disputes
that
occur
day
to
day
between
carriers
and
unions.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
section
3
of
the
act,
153
of
the
act,
which
provides
for
the
statutory
adjustment
boards
to
determine
disputes
that
arise
daily
between
carriers
and
unions.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
it's
found
at
page
138
and
139.
if
you
proceed
through
section
3
of
the
act,
to
page
141,
we
see
the
various
provisions
of
the
act
pertaining
to
the
authority
of
the
various
adjustment
boards
to
resolve
disputes
between
employees
and
certain
unions
and
the
carriers.
and
what
elgin
read
into
that
was
the
understanding
that
these
kinds
of
disputes,
minor
disputes,
would
be
resolved
through
the
provisions
of
the
act
in
section
3
by
one
of
these
designated
statutory
adjustment
boards.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
that's
essentially
correct,
your
honor.
the
court
looked
into
the
provisions
of
the
existence
of
the
adjustment
boards
and
read
into
that
the
fact
that
these
kinds
of
disputes
would
be
resolved
by
these
adjustment
boards,
and
that's
precisely
why
they
were
created.
now,
the
issue
involved
in
this
case,
in
terms
of
the
lower
court's
decision,
pertain
to
the
court's
conclusion
that
this
was
not
a
minor
dispute,
but
in
fact
a
major
dispute.
and
we
believe
what
drove
the
court's
decision
was
drug
testing
standing
alone.
in
the
court's
opinion,
the
lower
court
concluded,
that
because
drug
testing
was
so
controversial,
was
so
full
of
practical
dilemmas
and
problems,
it
looked
back...
it
caused
it
to
look
back
into
the
past
practices
of
the
party,
and
instead
of
looking
at
the
overall
right
which
conrail
had
to
determine
fitness
for
duty,
it
focused
only
on
one
narrow
portion
of
the
past
practice
involving
when
conrail
had
tested
based
on
what
it
described
as
particularized
suspicion.
by
doing
that,
we
contend--
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
--the
court
described
that
as
particularized
suspicion.
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
there
is
no
concept
of
particularized
suspicion
in
the
medical
community
or
in
our
medical
department.
physicians
do
not
test
on
particularized
suspicion.
they
examine
employees
and
they
determine
solely
whether
or
not
that
employee
may
have
a
detectable
condition.
now,
in
this
situation
what
the
court
did
then
was
to
do
essentially
what
we
often
ask
the
arbitrator
to
do
in
the
process
of
adjustment.
we
ask
the
arbitrator
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
new
policy
was
in
fact
justified
by
the
old,
whether
or
not
drug
testing
is
important
or
not,
whether
or
not
there
is
some
impact,
for
example,
on
employees.
because
the
point
that
needs
to
be
emphasized
here
is...
in
this
situation
the
court's
role
is
only
to
determine
the
forum
for
deciding
the
dispute,
not
whether
somebody
gets
a
resolution
of
the
dispute.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
the
adjustment
board
could
determine
precisely
that.
it
could
say...
it
could
contend
in
its
findings,
for
example,
that
the
drug
testing
program,
as
involved
in
this
case,
was
not
in
fact
justified
by
the
prior
practice.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
there
is
no
specific
statutory
authorization
to
determine
a
major
dispute
per
se.
what
the
adjustment
boards
do
is
they
simply
determine
the
dispute
in
question
between
the
carrier
and
the
union.
and
in
doing
that,
they
determine
whether
or
not
that
practice
was
in
fact
justified.
the
issue
of
major
and
minor,
again,
is
a
court-ordered
decision.
that
is,
a
court
determination
which
has
been
developed
in
a
series
of
circuit
courts.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
the
characterization
of
what
the
adjustment
board
finds
i
think
is
incorrect
in
this
respect...
the
adjustment
board
solely
determines
whether
or
not
the
current
practice
was
justified
by
the
prior
practice
in
the
course
of
deciding
the
grievance.
but
it
doesn't
make
a
specific
finding
that
a
major
dispute
exists
or
a
minor
dispute
exists
in
the
process.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
it
certainly
does
do
that.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
well,
it
would
decide
in
either
event.
for
example,
in
other
cases
involving
special
boards
of
adjustment
where
they
have
considered
the
use
of
certain
kinds
of
detection
devices,
the
courts
have
seen
fit
to
address
the
question
of
whether
use
of
detection
devices
in
aid
of
a
rule
was
in
fact
justified
by
the
prior
practice.
but
in
concluding
that
they
weren't,
in
some
case,
in
a
senses,
your
honor,
they
are
deciding
that
this
was
not
justified
and,
therefore,
it
was
not
a
minor
dispute.
but,
by
the
same
token--
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
--and
in
a
sense
not
arbitrable.
but
the
adjustment
board
still
was
making
a
determination
based
upon
a
review
of
the
past
practice
and
the
charge
sought
by
the
carrier.
and
i
think
that
is
a
critical
component
of
the
error
of
the
court
below
in
this
case.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
that
is
essentially
correct.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
that's
the
operative
provision
that
talks
to
that.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
essentially
correct.
that
was
part
of
the
complaint
below,
that
the
action
of
adding
the
drug
test
was
a
change
in
the
agreements
between
the
parties
with
respect
to--
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
--that's
correct.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
it's
not
that
kind
of
change,
your
honor,
because,
as
the
courts
have
long
recognized...
a
number
of
circuit
court
decisions
which
have
considered
it...
if
you
are
doing
something
which
is
consistent
with
your
past-practice,
that
is
at
least
arguably
related
to
your
past
practice,
then
you
have
not
made
a
change
which
violates
section
2
seventh
by
definition.
and,
by
the
same
token,
if
it
is
a
minor
dispute,
the
courts...
the
cases
recognize
that
the
carrier
has
the
right
to
continue
to
take
that
action
whether
or
not
it
is
subsequently
bargained
over
between
the
parties.
this
gets
into
the
issue
of
the
status
quo
that
is
supposed
to
exist
at
the
time
that
bargaining
occurs,
for
example.
this
court
in
shore
line--
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
--as
embodied
in
agreements
certainly
is
the
concept
that
we're
discussing
here.
as
embodied
in
agreements...
the
language
of
embodied
in
agreements
as
interpreted
by
this
court
has
also
been
intended
to
include
prior
practices
and
customs
broadly
conceived
between
the
parties
that
have
been
in
existence
at
the
time.
so,
as
a
consequence--
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
--even
if
not--
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
--yes,
your
honor.
the
whole
point
is
that
not
all
agreements
are
specifically
written
down
in
form.
but,
in
fact,
many
of
the
agreements
exist
by
practice
and
custom
between
the
parties
based
upon
the
past
practice.
and
that's
precisely
the
kind
of
agreements
that
we're
talking
about
here.
the
past
practice
being
the
right
of
conrail
to
set
these
medical
fitness
for
duty
standards.
the
question
then
was
whether
the
addition
of
the
drug
test
changed
that
agreement,
or
was
it
arguably,
at
least,
related
to
that
agreement
in
a
way
that
it
would
allow
an
arbitrator
to
ultimately
determine
who
was
right
and
wrong.
and
we
find
that
in
this
case,
your
honor,
the
court
proceeded
to
take
that
additional
step
to
determine
who
was
right
and
who
was
wrong
and
the
consequences
of
that
action.
and
i
think
in
doing
that
it
usurped
the
function
that
arbitration
plays
in
this
process.
i'd
like
to
close
at
this
point
and
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
we
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
we
contend
that
the
issue
for
the
adjustment
board
is
solely
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
practice
as
a
whole
in
the
context
of
agreements
may
well
have
been
justified
as--
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
--the
adjustment
boards
do
not
make
determinations,
your
honor,
with
respect
to
the
violations
of
the
act
per
se.
we
believe
that
that
jurisdiction
is
in
the
courts,
to
determine
per
se
the
question
of
a
violation.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
no.
the
adjustment
board,
your
honor,
in
that
situation
would
resolve
the
dispute
in
the
context
of
the
claims
that
exist
between
those
parties.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
it
would
not
determine
a
major
dispute
because
a
major
dispute
would
be
something
that
would
be
subject
to
bargaining.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
if
it
finds
that
it's
a
major
dispute
in
that
situation,
in
that
hypothetical,
then
the
parties
would
be
relegated
to...
to--
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
--it's...
it's
correct
to
the
extent
as
follows.
if
the
adjustment
board
finds
that
you
have
a
major
dispute
in
a
case,
the
parties
would
then
be
relegated
to
deciding
whether
or
not
they
want
to
bargain
over
it.
mr.
dennis
j.
morikawa
it
would
not
necessarily
mean
they
would
have
to
bargain.
it's
really
a
question
of
choice
on
the
part
of
the
union
or
the
carrier
in
this
case.
if
something
is
a
major
dispute,
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
the
parties
must
go
out
and
then
begin
bargaining.
bargaining
begins
by
the
initiation
of
a
process
in
section
6,
which
is
a
service
of
a
notice
initiating
the
process
of
bargaining.
in
addition
to
that,
the
question
of
the
particulars
of
a
bargain
that
they
may
want
to
talk
about
may
be
the
subject
of
a
different
version,
completely
different,
from
what
the
adjustment
board
may
have
characterized
the
dispute
below.
so
that
in
that
sense
the
adjustment
board's
decision
is
not
dispositive
with
respect
to
what
is
to
be
bargained
in
the
future.
it's
simply
a
determination
of
whether
or
not
the
parties
dispute
in
this
case
was
justified
by
the
practice
or
was
a
new
practice
that
was
not
contemplated
by
the
original.
