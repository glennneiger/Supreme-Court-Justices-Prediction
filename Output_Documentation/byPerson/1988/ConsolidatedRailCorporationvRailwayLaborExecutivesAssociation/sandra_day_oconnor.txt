mr.
morikawa,
i
gather
that
before
1987
the
medical
screening
did
not
include
testing
for
drug
use
except
on
the
basis
of
particularized
suspicion.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
we
accept
that
as
the
case,
do
we
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
see
any
limits
on
the
tests
that
conrail
could
require
for
medical
testing?
could
it
test...
initiate
testing
for
aids
or
pregnancy,
for
example,
in
the
urine
specimens
without
characterizing
it
as
a
major
dispute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
uh-huh.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
is
it
true
that
for
another
disease
that
requires
some
kind
of
medical
consultation
or
treatment
that
if
the
employee
were
ordered
to
take
certain
treatment
to
cure
the
disease
and
the
employee
refused
to
cooperate
and
do
that,
that
no
disciplinary
action
could
be
taken?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
employee
fails
to
show
up
for
the
medical
appointments
or
fails
to
do
what
the
doctor
instructs,
can
no
discipline
be
enforced?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
other
side
takes
the
other
view
and
says,
"we've
always
disciplined
employees
who
fall
to
cooperate.
"
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
suppose
that
it's
a
completely
curable
medical
condition
if
they
take
the
medication
that's
prescribed
or
do
the
exercises
that
they're
told
to
do
and
they
just
refuse
to
do
it?
they
can't
be
disciplined?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--may
i
go
back
to
a
question
that
you
started
to
answer
and
then
i
don't
think
you
ever
answered.
what
if
you
have
a
dispute
over
whether
there
is
a
change
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
who
decides
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
arguable
that
it's
not
a
change?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
who
decides
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
adjustment
board
can't
make
that
determination?
