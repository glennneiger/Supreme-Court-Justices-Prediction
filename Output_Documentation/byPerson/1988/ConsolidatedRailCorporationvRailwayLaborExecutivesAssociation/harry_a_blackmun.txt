well,
their
system
didn't
work
very
well
with
respect
to
the
maryland
disaster,
did
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now,
you
have
a
new
test
out,
i'll
put
it
that
way.
to
what
extent
does
the
desired
test
differ
in
any
way
as
far
as
the
individual
is
concerned
from
what
it
was
before
the
test
for
drug
was
instituted?
the
blood
is
drawn...
is
it
any
different
with
respect
to
the
individual?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
the
patient
does
nothing
any
different
now
than
he
did
before
the
test
was
refined?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
i
suppose
this
is
to
be
anticipated
as
medicine
develops
and
we
find
out
more
about
urine
and
its
possibilities.
