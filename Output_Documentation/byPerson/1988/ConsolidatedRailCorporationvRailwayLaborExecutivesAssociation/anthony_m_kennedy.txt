justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
take
it
that
this
adjustment
board
itself
can
determine
that
it's
a
major
dispute
after
it
hears
the
evidence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
explicit
statutory
authorization
for
that
authority?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
thought
that
at
some
point
the
adjustment
board
could
say,
"we've
concluded
that
this
is
a
major
dispute
and,
therefore,
that
it
is
not
within
our
purview
to
resolve.
"
am
i
incorrect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
i
may
just
ask
you
one
more
question.
the
government's
brief
at
page
9
says
that
if
the
adjustment
board
concludes
that
a
dispute
is
a
major
one,
it
will
issue
an
order
to
that
effect
and
will
remit
the
parties
to
negotiation
and
mediation
under
the
statute.
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
disagree
that
an
adjustment
board
can
ever
say
this
is
a
major
dispute,
we
have
no
jurisdiction,
we
remit
you
to
mediation?
that's
wrong
as
a
matter
of
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
an
adjustment
board
must
adjudicate
any
dispute
that's
submitted
to
it
by
a
court
even
if
it
considers
it
to
be
major?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
how
can
it
do
that
if
it's
a
major
dispute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's
assume
that
it
finds
that
it's
a
major
dispute
after
it
has
been
remitted
to
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
the
government's
brief
is
correct.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
by
order
of
the
board.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
before
you
leave
that,
does
that
refer
to
minor
and
major
disputes?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
your
view,
does
the
language
that
we've
just
examined
refer
both
to
major
and
minor
disputes?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
in--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so
then
in
that
view
the
adjustment
board
could
determine
the
dispute,
whether
or
not
it
was
major
or
minor?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
said
there
are
set
procedures
for
having
you
taken
out
of
service
until
you're
cured.
are
those
in
the
contract
or
are
they
outside
the
contract?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
aren't
there
a
whole
set
of
procedures
under
the...
that
the
company
has
adopted
for
the
administration
of
its
own
physical
examinations
that
are
not
in
the
contract?
