yeah,
but
it
does
decide
whether
it's
within
its
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
really...
and
if
it
thinks
it's
a
minor
dispute,
it
will
decide
it.
if
it
isn't
a
minor
dispute,
it
won't.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
not
arbitrable.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
agree
with...
do
you
agree
with
the
arguable
standard
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
uh-huh.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
it's
just...
what
if
the
question
is,
well,
if
you
interpret
the
contract
one
way,
this
is
a
change;
if
you
interpret
it
another
way,
it's
not
a
change?
and
it's
arguable
that
the
contract
would...
there
is
an
arguable
interpretation
of
that
contract
which
would
indicate
this
is
not
a
change?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
say...
you
say
if
it's
arguable,
the
courts
have
to
decide
it
in
the
first
instance?
