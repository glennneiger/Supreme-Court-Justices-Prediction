mr.
morikawa,
is
the
consequences
of
being
unfit
for
duty
for
medical
reasons...
are
they
determined
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
or
are
they
set
by
the
railroad?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
were
the
consequences
before
this
change?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
have
those...
are
those
same
consequences
attached
to
failure
of
this
test
a
couple
of
times?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
happens
if
the
employee
fails
two
or
three
times?
justice
john
paul
stevens
will
they
ever
get
to
the
point
where
they
are
discharged?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
see,
he's
willing
to
provide
the
sample,
but
it
doesn't
turn
out
to
be
clean.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
trying
to
find...
is
there
a
point
where
he'll
be
discharged?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
was
that
true
before
under
your
old
practice
that
you
say
this
is
just
continuation
of?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand.
but,
say,
somebody
got
pneumonia
and
he
came...
he
thought
he
was
well
and
he
took
a
test,
and
no,
you're
not
healthy
enough
to
go
back
in
to
work.
and
then
he
comes
back
45
days
later
and
fails
again.
would
he
be
fired?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
not
so
much
concerned
about
whether
it's
volition
or
not
as
whether
it's
a
continuation
of
the
past
practice
or
if
there
is
a
significant
change.
and
i
think
arguably
it
would
be
a
significant
change
if
the
failure
of
this
test
could
result
in
discharge
while
the
failure
of
the
prior
test
would
just
result
in
waiting
another
week
or
two
to
go
back
to
work.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
aren't
you
trying
to
get
people
addicted
to
drugs
off...
off
the
line?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
morikawa,
can
i
go
back
to
justice
scalia's
concern
about
the
statute?
your
argument
seems
to
proceed
as
though
this
is
all
a
judge-made
doctrine.
but
isn't
it
true
that
paragraph
7
says
in
so
many
words
that
the
carrier
cannot
make
a
change
in
the
rates
of
pay,
rules,
or
working
conditions
of
its
employees
as
a
class
except
by
following
the
bargaining
procedure.
that
is
the
definition
of
a
major
dispute,
is
making
a
change
prohibited
by
that
section
unless
you
follow
a
certain
procedure,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
so
you
have
to
convince
us
that
this
is
not
a
change
in
rates
of
pay,
rules,
or
working
conditions
of
its
employees
as
a
class.
that's
the
issue,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
a
class
and
affecting
the
entire
population,
as
opposed
to
a
minor
dispute
with
a
particular
employee
who
claims
that
he
did
or
did
not...
or,
there
was
or
was
not
a
violation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
why
isn't
this
precisely
that
kind
of
change?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
clarke,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
be
consistent
with
what
you've
just
said
all
the
way
through
for
the
railroad
to
say
after
you
filed
your
lawsuit,
well,
we
didn't
think
there
was
any
change
here,
we
think
we
were
just
making
a...
pursuing
a
past
practice
that
is
implicitly
authorized
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement?
but
a
dispute
new
seems
to
have
arisen
and
therefore,
pursuant
to
subparagraph
(i),
we
will
file
some
kind
of
a
proceeding
before
the
adjustment
board
and
say,
please
tell
us
whether
we
are
right
or
wrong
about
our
reading
of
the
agreement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
had
they
done
that,
and
had
the
adjustment
board
said,
yes,
this
is
authorized
by
the
agreement,
then
your
lawsuit
would
be
gone.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
also,
you
could
have
done
that
too,
couldn't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
you're
saying
is
it
is
so
clear
that
there
is
no
change
in
the
terms
of
the
agreement
that
it's
not
even
arguable--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and,
therefore,
no
basis...
there
is
no
way
in
the
world
the
arbitrator
could
have--
