j.
brennan,

now,
is
that
a
minor
dispute
section?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
isn't
that...
isn't
there
a
question
here
whether
we
have
a
major
dispute
or
a
minor
dispute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
it's
a
major
dispute,
there's
jurisdiction.
if
there's
a
minor
dispute,
there
is
not--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--in
the
district
court.
and
it
was
held
below
that
it
was
a
minor
dispute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
therefore
no
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
this...
disputes
in
this
drug
testing
program,
may
not
some
be
minor
and
some
be
major?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
minor
disputes?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
uh-huh.
and
the
court
of
appeals
held--
--they
were
major.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
forgive
me.
don't
they
look
at
whether
or
not...
a
subject
matter
in
any
respect
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
if
there
is
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
doesn't
the
existence
or
not
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
bear
on
whether
you
have
a
major
or
a
minor
dispute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
even
if
not
spelled
out?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
like
with
the
bargaining
agreement
itself,
nevertheless
we
regard
it
as
part
of
it
if
it's
part
of
the
relationship
in
the
past
between
the
parties?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
only
because
it's
a
difficulty
or
dispute
over
the
meaning
of
the
contract
or
a
provision
of
the
contract.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
it's
a
dispute
that
does
not
involve
the
interpretation
or
the
meaning
of
the
contract,
then
is
it
a
major
dispute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
everyone
agrees
to
that,
mr.
clarke?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--does
the
other
side
agree
with
you
that
what's
involved
here
is
a
change?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
can
they
do
that
until
they
determine
that
there
has
been
a
change?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
don't
they
have
to
determine
that
what's
involved
is
a
change
before
they
can
do
anything?
