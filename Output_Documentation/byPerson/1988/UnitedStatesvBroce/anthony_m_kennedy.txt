justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
isn't
there
some
argument
that
they
didn't
agree
to
those
facts
at
all?
isn't
there
some
argument
that
he
didn't
really
agree
that
there
were
two
conspiracies?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
think
the
indictment
was
clear
enough
to
make
that
clear?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
isn't
there
some
argument
that
it
wasn't?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
to
pursue
that...
if
in
menna
there
had
been
an
allegation
that
there
had
been
prior
conduct
disposed
of
by
an
earlier
plea
and
a
further
assertion
that
the
earlier
plea
was
for
a
different
transaction,
or
a
different
occurrence,
then
there
would
have
been
double
jeopardy?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
your
response
to
justice
scalla
was
that
it
depends
on
whether
or
not
it's
a
dispute
matter
in
taking,
in
the
taking
of
the
plea.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
there
had
been
any
factual
allegations
of
the
prior
conviction
in
menna,
there
would
then...
the
case
would
then
be
like
the
instant
one?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
case
would
be
like
the
instant
one,
if
there
had
been
factual
allegations
of
what
occurred
in
menna?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
except
when
we
talk
about
"on
the
face",
we
talk
about
the
records
that
we
can
look
to
to
the
make
the
determination.
and
here,
in
your
case,
we
can
look
at
the
record
of
the
later
proceeding
and
see
there's
only
one
conspiracy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
you
win,
their
lack
of
discernment
has
served
their
client
quite
well.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
nor,
frequently
people
feel
that
way
when
they
lose.
