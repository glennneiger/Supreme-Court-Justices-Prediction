chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
on
no.
87-1190,
united
states
against
broce.
mr.
englert,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
all
of
these
proceedings
after
the
plea
agreement
and
since
were
under
rule
35?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
anything
that
can
be
brought
under
rule
35
can
also
be
brought
under
federal
habeas?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
really
get
to
any
double
jeopardy
claim,
because
on
the
facts
to
which
the
defendant
agreed,
there
was
no
dud.
there
were
two
separate
conspiracies.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
raise
a
double
jeopardy
issue,
at
least
you
don't
raise
one
successfully,
before
you
plead
guilty,
because...
you
raise
a
multiplicity
objection.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
jeopardy
doesn't
attach
until
either
the
first
witness
is
sworn
or,
you
know,
whatever,
on
a
court
trial.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
mr.
casebeer,
we'll
now
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
pronounce
your
client's
name?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
casebeer,
sir,
when
you
talk
about
the
government's
own
statement,
do
you
mean
their
statement
in
this
court,
or
in
the
indictment,
or
in
the
official
statement
for
sentencing?
at
what
point?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
for
sentencing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
an
indictment
doesn't
raise
any
double
jeopardy
problems
until
double
jeopardy
doesn't
attach
until
you
either...
until
you
go
to
trial,
or
until
you're
sentenced.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you
had
some
difficulty
with
those
indictments,
surely
the
thing
to
do
is
not
to
plead
to
them,
but
to
contest
them.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there's
no
claim
of
ineffective
assistance.
that
wasn't
the
tenth
circuit's
ruling
at
all,
that
there
was
some
sort
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
that
would
enable
him
to
go
back
into
this
thing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
are
lots
of
rights
that
can
be
waived
without
that
sort
of
johnson
against
zerbest
approach,
as
witness
your
fourth
amendment
claim.
but
here,
the
government
also
contends
that
the
defendant,
in
the
plea
agreement,
simply
agreed
factually
that
there
were
two
different
conspiracies.
so
in
that
view,
you
never
get
to
the
double
jeopardy
question,
because
the
defendant
is
bound
by
what
he
pleaded
to,
for
which
certainly
some
of
our
cases
hold.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
plea
agreement,
i
take
it,
is
what's
on
record
in
the
district
court,
where
you
have
the
indictment
and
the
plea?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
know,
how
much
relitigation
of
the
factual
basis
for
this
case
is
permitted
on
federal
habeas?
these
are
things
you're
supposed
to
thrash
out
either
in
a
trial
or
by
a
plea
agreement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
not
can
it
be
waived.
it's
a
question...
if
you've
got
problems
with
the
indictment,
if
it
seems
vague
to
you,
if
you
think
no,
there's
really
only
one
conspiracy,
not
so
many
separate
ones...
do
you
fight
that
at
the
time
that
you're
pleading
to
the
indictment,
or
do
you
go
ahead
and
plead
guilty
and
then
try
to
raise
it
years
later?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
didn't
have
to
plead
if
they
were
confused
by
the
indictment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
casebeer.
mr.
englert,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
englert.
the
case
is
submitted.
