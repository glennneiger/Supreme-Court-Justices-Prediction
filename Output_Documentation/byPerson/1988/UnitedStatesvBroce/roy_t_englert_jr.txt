mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
defendants
who
plead
guilty
to
two
facially
valid
indictments
have
the
right
to
claim
later,
for
the
first
time
on
collateral
attack,
that
they
were
guilty
of
only
one
crime,
despite
what
the
indictment
said.
the
tenth
circuit
held
that
defendants
do
have
that
right.
we
contend
that
they
do
not.
on
november
17,
1981,
a
grand
jury
in
the
district
of
kansas
indicated
ray
broce,
broce
construction
company,
and
the
general
manager
of
broce
construction
company
on
a
single
charge
of
sherman
act
conspiracy.
the
indictment
specifically
alleged
that
the
conspiracy
began
in
or
about
april,
1978,
and
had
as
its
object
the
rigging
of
bids
on
a
road
construction
project
in
meade
county,
kansas,
let
on
april
25,
1978.
on
february
4,
1982,
the
grand
jury
returned
its
second
indictment.
this
indictment
also
alleged
sherman
act
conspiracy,
specifically
alleged
this
conspiracy
began
in
july
of
1979
and
had
as
its
object
the
rigging
of
bids
on
a
barton
county
construction
project
that
was
let
on
july
17,
1979,
also
in
kansas.
in
late
january
of
1982,
the
government
and
the
defendants
were
already
engaged
in
plea
negotiations,
and
by
the
time
the
second
indictment
was
handed
up,
the
defendants
had
agreed
to
plead
guilty
to
the
meade
county
and
barton
county
charges.
the
government,
for
its
part,
had
agreed
not
to
prosecute
these
defendants
any
further
for
bid
rigging
in
either
kansas
or
oklahoma,
to
dismiss
one
count
of
mail
fraud
against
the
corporation,
and
to
make
certain
recommendations
at
sentencing.
the
guilty
pleas
were
duly
taken
on
february
8,
1982.
in
a
written
statement
of
facts
in
support
of
the
pleas,
the
government
described
the
two
conspiracies.
the
statement
shows
that
each
of
the
two
projects
involved
in
the
indictments
was
the
quid
pro
quo
for
concessions
that
broce
made
to
the
co-conspirators.
in
the
case
of
the
april
25,
1978
bidletting,
there
was
a
trade-off
of
several
projects
that
were
let
on
that
date.
in
the
case
of
the
july,
1979
bidletting,
broce
paid
$75,000
to
a
co-conspirator
who
would
otherwise
have
bid
competitively.
nothing
in
that
written
statement
of
facts
suggests
any
relationship
between
the
april,
1978
conspiracy
and
the
july,
1979
conspiracy.
in
fact,
there
was
some
colloquy
at
the
plea-taking
hearing
in
which
mr.
broce,
under
oath,
mentioned
that
he
would
not
trade
off
a
gray
county
project
that
was
to
be
let
at
a
subsequent
bid
letting
for
the
meade
county
project,
because
he
intended
each
letting
to
stand
on
its
own.
the
facts
of
this
case
were
visited
one
more
time,
on
march
15,
1982,
when
the
defendants
were
sentenced.
the
government
prepared
an
official
version
of
the
offense,
which
was
included
in
the
pre-sentence
report
of
the
defendants.
like
the
statement
of
facts
in
support
of
the
pleas,
the
official
version
of
the
offense
described
the
two
conspiracies
in
some
detail,
again
saying
what
the
quid
pro
quos
were.
again,
it
showed
no
relationship
between
the
april,
1978
and
july,
1979
conspiracies.
furthermore,
the
official
version
of
the
offense
made
explicit
what
had
been
implicit
all
along.
it
said
in
so
many
words
that
there
were
two
separate
conspiracies
giving
rise
to
the
indictment.
the
defendants
were
given
an
opportunity
at
sentencing
to
contest
anything
contained
in
the
official
version
of
the
offense,
and
they
did
have
some
quarrels
with
it,
but
no
quarrel
at
all
with
the
proposition
there
were
two
separate
conspiracies.
in
early
1983,
a
decision
was
handed
down
in
a
separate
but
related
kansas
bid
rigging--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
broce
received
a
$50,000
fine
for
each
of
the
two
sherman
act
conspiracies,
as
well
as
a
$1,000
fine
for
mail
fraud.
he
received
concurrent
two-year
sentences.
the
corporation
received--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--that
was
explicit
in
the
plea
agreements,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
explicit.
the
decision
in
united
states
v.
beachner
construction
company
came
down
in
early
1983.
the
district
court
held
in
that
case
that
all
the
bid
rigging
on
highway
construction
projects
in
kansas,
throughout
the
entire
period
of
the
1960's
and
1970's,
was
one
massive,
continuing,
ongoing
conspiracy.
the
broce
defendants
sought
to
take
advantage
of
the
beachner
ruling,
even
though
they
had
already
admitted
participating
in
two
conspiracies.
in
a
rule
35
motion,
they
asked
the
district
court
to
hold
that
because
they
had
been
guilty
of
only
one
conspiracy,
even
though
they
had
pleaded
to
two,
their
sentences
were
illegal,
and
the
corporation's
$750,000...
the
corporation's
fine
had
to
be
reduced
by
$750,000,
the
individual's
fine
by
$50,000.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes,
the
theory
of
beachner,
your
honor,
is
that
there
was
just
one
conspiracy
on
every--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--including
these
two,
every
highway
construction
project
in
kansas
throughout
the
60's
and
70's.
the
government
strenuously
contested
the
defendants'
claim
that
they
had
the
right
to
escape
from
their
prior
plea
bargains
on
the
basis
of
beachner,
although
the
government
stipulated
that
the
court
could
consider
the
beachner
record.
the
district
court
agreed
with
the
government
that
the
defendants'
guilty
pleas
foreclosed
their
belated
attempt
to
contend
that
they
had
been
guilty
of
only
one
conspiracy.
in
so
ruling,
the
district
court
relied
upon
the
first
circuit's
ruling
in
kerrigan
v.
united
states,
which
says
that
if
the
defendant
once
he
pleads
guilty
to
multiple
conspiracies,
cannot
contest
the
theoretical
and
factual
foundations
of
the
indictment
or
indictments
alleging
those
conspiracies.
the
tenth
circuit,
sitting
en
banc,
reversed
and
remanded.
in
a
ruling
that
it
has
since
acknowledged
was
erroneous,
the
tenth
circuit
first
held
that
the
defendants'
right
not
to
be
sentenced
twice
for
the
same
offense,
when
they
had
only
committed
one
offense,
was
"absolute"
and
not
subject
to
forfeiture
or
waiver
in
any
way,
no
matter
how
hard
they
tried.
the
court
also
held
that
the
question
of
one
conspiracy
versus
two
required
factual
proceedings
on
remand,
and
the
court
therefore
sent
the
case
back
to
the
district
court.
on
remand,
the
district
court
simply
followed
beachner
and
held
that
there
was
one
massive
conspiracy,
and
that
therefore
these
two
bid
riggings
were
part
of
that
massive
conspiracy.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
they
purported
to
be
brought
under
rule
35,
your
honor.
technically,
i
don't
think
that's
the
correct
way
to
bring
allegations
like
this.
i
think
technically
it
should
be
brought
in
a
2255
proceeding,
but
that
issue
was
not
raised
in
the
lower
courts,
and
it
purported
all
to
be
under
rule
35.
we
appealed--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--no,
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
but
as
i
understand
rule
35,
the
purpose
of
rule
35
is
to
correct
sentences
that
the
legislature
did
not
intend
for
the
crimes
for
which
the
defendants
had
been
convicted.
we
don't
think
the
procedural
posture
of
this
case
makes
any
difference.
the
basis
issue
is
the
constitutional
issue.
we
appealed
the
district
court's
ruling
vacating
the
defendants'
conviction
and
sentences
for
the
second
conspiracy,
but
the
tenth
circuit
affirmed.
the
tenth
circuit
now
acknowledged
its
earlier
error
in
saying
that
the
double
jeopardy
right
was
absolute,
but
it
said
the
issue
now
was
whether
the
guilty
pleas
themselves
"waived
the
double
jeopardy
protection"
and
it
found
no
such
waiver.
we're
here
today
arguing
that
the
tenth
circuit's
decision
should
be
reversed.
we
think
there
are
two
independently
sufficient
reasons
why
the
results
should
not
be
as
the
tenth
circuit
saw
it.
first,
the
tenth
circuit
completely
overlooked
the
fact
that
the
way
to
raise
and
resolve
factual
disputes
is
not
to
plead
guilty,
but
to
litigate
those
disputes
after
a
plea
of
not
guilty.
the
holding
of
the
tenth
circuit,
that
litigation
of
factual
disputes
can
be
postponed
until
after
a
guilty
plea,
is
absolutely
unprecedented.
second,
the
pleas
in
this
case
induced
the
government
to
rely
on
those
pleas
in
dismissing
other
charges.
the
government's
detrimental
reliance,
we
think,
is
also
a
basis
for
holding
the
defendants
to
their
pleas.
we
think
both
of
these
factors
serve
to
distinguish
menna
v.
new
york
and
blackledge
v.
perry,
the
only
the
cases
in
which
this
court
has
ever
held
that
a
defendant
can
escape
from
a
guilty
plea
entered
knowingly
and
voluntarily
on
advice
of
competent
counsel
through
proper
procedures.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
be
able
to
say
that,
but
i
don't
think
i
can
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
this
is
an
antitrust
case.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
and
so,
there
is
no
substantive
offense
that
corresponds
to
the
conspiracy
offense,
the
conspiracy
to
rig
bids.
if
this
were
a
drug
case,
for
example,
we
could--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
that's
consistent
with
what
the
sixth
circuit
said,
in
a
case
called
in
re
grand
jury
proceedings,
involving
delard
electric
company
and
the
sergeant
electric
company,
in
a
conspiracy
in
kentucky.
we
hesitate
to
endorse
the
sixth
circuit's
approach.
we
have
some
problem
under
braverman
with
the
proposition
that
there
are
things
that
can
be
prosecuted
separately
as
parent
conspiracies.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that
is
the
obstacle
we
see.
but
we
certainly
would
be
delighted
if
this
court
so
held.
when
a
defendant
is
faced
with
criminal
charges,
he
has
essentially
two
choices.
he
can
put
the
government
to
its
proof,
or
he
can
plead
guilty.
the
whole
point
of
a
guilty
plea
is
to
substitute
an
admission
of
the
government's
allegations
for
the
right
to
put
the
government
to
its
proof
and
have
those
allegations
adjudicated
by
the
court
and
the
jury.
the
choice
between
those
two
options,
once
made,
is
not
revocable
simply
because
the
defendant
later
thinks
better
of
it.
in
particular,
as
to
factual
matters,
the
defendant
has
to
put
the
matter
in
issue
and
get
it
resolved
before
pleading
guilty,
or
else
forget
about
pursuing
the
issue.
this
is
in
essence
exactly
what
the
first
circuit
said
in
kerrigan,
and
we
think
the
kerrigan
approach
is
exactly
the
one
this
court
should
adopt.
we
think
that
approach
follows
pretty
readily
from
menna
itself.
there
is
a
long
footnote
in
the
menna
opinion
which
is
the
subject
of
most
of
the
interpretation
in
the
lower
courts
of
that
case.
the
court
said
in
that
footnote
two
things
that
we
think
are
vitally
important.
first
of
all,
it
said
that
a
plea
of
guilty
quite
validly
removes
the
issue
of
factual
guilt
from
the
case.
second,
the
court
expressly
limited
its
holdings
to
the
situation
in
which
the
invalidity
of
the
indictment
can
be
"judged
on
its
face".
we
think
the
upshot
of
those
two
observations
together
is
that
when
the
indictment
is
valid
on
its
face,
and
a
claim
of
invalidity
depends
on
factual
matters,
the
plea
of
guilty
quite
validity
resolves
those
factual
issues.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that's
precisely
right,
your
honor.
it's
just
like
a
defendant
who
pleads
guilty,
and
then
says
later,
"well,
i
was
really
innocent.
"
on
the
facts
he
admitted,
he
was
guilty,
whether
or
not
he
later
claims
the
facts
are
otherwise.
it's
just
the
same
way
when
a
defendant
admits
he's
guilty
of
two
conspiracies.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
such
argument,
your
honor.
there
is--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--i
think
the
indictment
was
clear
enough
to
take
that
clear.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
there
is
some
argument
that
the
indictment
was
vague,
but
even...
i
think
that
argument
is
quite
wrong.
the
indictment
said
that
one
conspiracy
began
in
april,
1978
and
one
began
in
july,
1979.
if
those
allegations
are
true,
there
are
two
conspiracies.
even
if
the
indictment
were
vague,
the
government
said
in
so
many
words,
in
the
official
version
of
the
offense,
there
were
separate
conspiracies
here.
the
defendants
were
given
an
opportunity,
on
the
record,
to
say
otherwise,
and
they
declined
that
opportunity.
the
record
in
this
case
couldn't
be
clearer
that
the
defendants
agreed
that
there
were
two
separate
conspiracies.
now,
the
tenth
circuit's
only
response
to
the
argument
i've
just
made,
based
on
menna,
was
a
single
sentence
saying
that
the
facts
admitted
in
a
guilty
plea
go
only
to
factual
innocence
or
guilt
and
not
to
whether
there
were
two
conspiracies.
the
tenth
circuit
followed
that
sentence
with
a
citation
to
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
launlus
v.
united
states.
the
problem
with
the
tenth
circuit's
response
is
that
launlus
doesn't
support
it,
no
other
case
supports
it,
and
no
logic
supports
it.
there's
no
reason
why
a
defendant
making
factual
admissions
should
get
to
escape
from
those
factual
admissions
when
he's
arguing
multiplicity,
even
any
more
than
what
he's
saying
after
the
fact,
"i
pleaded
guilty,
but
what
i
said
wasn't
true.
"
"i
was
really
innocent.
"
now,
on
this
subject,
i
want
to
digress
for
a
moment
and
discuss
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
in
united
states
v.
atkins,
which
came
down
after
broce,
and
is...
tends
in
the
same
direction
as
the
decision
in
broce.
the
fifth
circuit
divided
all
these
cases
into
three
categories.
the
first
category
is
cases
like
menna,
in
which
it's
clear
from
the
face
of
the
indictment
that
there
are
invalid
charges.
in
those
cases,
of
course,
at
least
in
the
absence
of
a
plea
bargain,
one
grants
relief.
the
second
category
is
cases
in
which
it's
clear
from
the
face
of
the
indictment
that
there
are
two
separate
crimes;
and
in
those
cases,
the
fifth
circuit
said,
relief
can
be
denied.
in
the
vast
middle
category,
in
which
the
indictment
neither
proves
conclusively
nor
disproves
the
existence
of
separate
crimes,
the
fifth
circuit
said
the
constitution
always
commands
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
these
collateral
attacks.
we
think
that
broce
falls
into
the
atkins
court
second
category.
in
other
words,
we
think
the
record
shows
conclusively
there
were
two
conspiracies,
and
the
tenth
circuit
had
no
business
letting
the
defendants
supplement
and
contradict
their
prior
factual
admissions.
but
i
think
it's
also
important
for
the
court
to
understand
that
we
think
atkins
is
quite
wrong
in
saying
that
the
constitution
requires
evidentiary
hearings
in
cases
of
ambiguity.
the
correct
categorization,
in
our
view,
is
just
two
categories:
the
menna
cases,
in
which
you
can
tell
from
the
face
of
the
indictment
that
there
is
an
invalid
charge,
and
all
other
cases,
in
which
the
defendant
should
not
be
entitled
to
relief.
the
reason
why
the
defendant
should
not
be
entitled
to
relief
is
that
he
has
the
opportunity,
by
seeking
a
bill
of
particulars,
by
litigating,
to
put
the
government
to
its
proof
in
cases
of
vague
indictments,
to
make
the
government
supplement
the
allegations,
and
to
make
any
counter
allegations
he
wants.
there's
no
reason
why
he
should
be
allowed
to
postpone
until
after
his
guilty
plea
litigation
over
issues
he
could
have
resolved
before
the
guilty
plea.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
would
be
a
factual
admission.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
it
was
undisputed
that
there
was
a
prior
trial
for
the
same
offense
in
that
case.
maybe
new
york
could
have
argued
that,
but
new
york
certainly
didn't
try
to
argue
the
case
on
that
basis.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
if
it
had
been
undisputed
at
the
time--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--that's
correct.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
all
i
can
say,
your
honor,
is
the
court
certainly
didn't
look
at
it
that
way.
the
court
viewed
the
plea
in
menna
as
not
a
series
of
factual
admissions
but
as
simply
an
admission
of
factual
guilt,
to
be
sure,
but
the
validity
of
the
indictment
on
its
face
was
left
open.
there
was
no
doubt
at
the
time
of
the
guilty
plea,
or
at
any
other
time
in
the
menna,
justice
scalia
that
there
had
been
a
prior
trial.
and
that
was
not
what
people
were
fighting
about.
what
we
were
fighting
about,
potentially
fighting
about
in
this
case,
was
what
potentially
was
a
bone
fide
dispute
between
the
government
and
the
defendants,
about
whether
there
was
one
conspiracy
or
only
two.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
there
was
no
doubt
raised
by
the
defendants.
there
has
been
doubt
injected
later
on
by
the
ruling
in
beachner.
but
the
litigable...
the
point
is,
there
was
a
litigable
issue,
and
it
was
the
defendants
who
failed
to
litigate
the
issue.
in
menna,
nobody
thought
there
is
a
litigable
issue
over
whether
there
had
been
a
prior
trial.
but
that
litigable--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--it's
not
just
plausibly
disputed.
it's
that
the
government
is
in
fact
advancing
a
position,
in
this
case,
the
position
that
there
were
two
conspiracies,
as
opposed
to
in
menna,
the
state
was
not
advancing
the
proposition
at
any
time
that
there
had
been
no
prior
trial.
if
the
state,
if
the
government,
in
charging
advances
a
factual
proposition
in
complete
bad
faith,
and
the
issue
is
not
even
litigable,
then
we
might
have
a
difference
case.
but
what
we
have
here
is
the
defendant
said
there
were
two
conspiracies.
the
defendants...
excuse
me,
the
government
said
there
were
two
conspiracies.
the
defendants
didn't
say
otherwise.
at
best,
the
factual
dispute
developed
later
on.
what
we
had
in
menna
was
the
state
said,
you
pleaded
guilty
to
a
previous
offense,
but
we
have
as
a
matter
of
law
a
separate
defense.
there
was
no
question
in
menna,
in
the
guilty
plea
proceedings,
of
the
government
saying
one
thing
and
the
defendant
admitting
that.
in
other
words,
there
was
no
fact,
no
factual
allegation
that
there
had
not
been
a
prior
trial
for
the
defendant
to
admit.
in
this
case,
there
was
an
explicit
factual
allegation
of
two
conspiracies
for
the
defendant
to
admit.
one
of
the
reasons
why--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--i
think
not,
if
there
had
been
an
assertion
it
was
for
a
different
transaction
or
occurrence.
the
only
issue
in
menna
was
whether,
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
contempt
charge
and
the
failure
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury
charge
were
under
new
york
law,
the
same
offense.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes,
and
i
think
if
the
disputed
matter
had
been
whether
there
were
separate
occurrences
giving
rise
to
the
two
charges
in
menna,
that
would
be
a
factual
dispute
between
the
government
and
the
defendant,
that
the
defendant
would
have
to
put
in
issue
in
order
to
have
a
right
to
raise
that
issue.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
think
so.
i
think
that's
the
import
of
the
court's
footnote,
saying
we
are
only
holding
that
when
two
indictments,
judged
on
their
face,
charge
the
same
offense,
then
the
defendant
gets
to
raise
his
double
jeopardy
claim
later.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
think
that
later
proceedings
never...
well,
the
later
proceeding
in
beachner
should
have
taken
place.
the
later
proceeding
in
this
case
never
should
have
taken
place.
there
is
no
reason
why
the
defendants
had
any
right
at
all
to
raise
that
issue
after
their
pleas
of
guilty.
one
of
the
reasons
why
defendants
should
not
be
allowed
to
postpone
the
litigation
of
factual
issues
until
after
their
pleas
of
guilty
and
this
is
the
second
reason
why
we
think
the
tenth
circuit
was
wrong
is
because
it
gives
them
an
opportunity
to
sandbag
the
government.
they
can
say,
"okay,
let's
get
some
concessions
from
the
government,
and
we
will
plead
to
certain
charges
in
exchange
for
those
concessions.
"
then,
once
the
government
has
given
up
its
prosecutorial
opportunities,
and
evidence
has
become
stale,
the
defendants
then
come
in
and
say,
"now
that
we've
gotten
our
part
of
the
bargain,
it's
time
to
go
back
and
revisit
the
admissions
we
made.
"
we
don't
think
that
should
be
allowed.
this
court's
decision
two
terms
ago,
in
ricketts
v.
adamson,
supports
our
position
that
a
defendant
who
enters
into
a
plea
bargain
is
in
a
different
position
than
a
defendant
who
simply
pleads
guilty.
in
menna
and
blackledge,
as
far
as
the
face
of
the
opinions
disclose,
there
was
no
plea
bargain.
even
if
there
was,
there
was
only
one
charge
in
each
case,
so
it
appears
that
all
the
government
could
have
bargained
away
was
its
right
to
make
certain
recommendations
concerning
sentence
on
the
very
invalid
charges
charged
in
those
indictments.
so,
those
bargains
would
have
failed
from
invalid
consideration,
even
if
there
had
been
plea
bargains.
this
is
a
different
case.
the
government
could
have
brought
charges
in
oklahoma,
and
there's
no
doubt
that
there
would
have
been
no
double
jeopardy
objection
to
bringing
charges
in
oklahoma,
whether
or
not
the
kansas
charges
were
for
the
same
conspiracy.
the
government
did
not
bring
those
oklahoma
charges
specifically
because
the
defendants
pleaded
guilty
to
two
kansas
charges.
it's
not
hard
to
imagine
what
would
have
happened
if
the
defendants
had
raised
this
issue,
this
double
jeopardy
issue
that
they
now
raise,
in
1982
before
pleading
guilty.
first
of
all,
we
would
have
litigated
the
issue.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
of
course,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
if
they
had
raised
their
multiplicity
issue
in
<nineteen
eighty-two>
[=
1982],
we
would
have
litigated
over
the
issue.
if
we
had
lost,
we
would
have
charged
them
in
oklahoma
and
gotten
more
than
one
conviction,
not
the
single
conviction...
or
at
least
tried
to
get
more
than
one
conviction,
not
the
single
conviction
without
our
having
the
opportunity
to
get
any
other
convictions
that
the
tenth
circuit
has
now
given
them.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
a
few
brief
points:
the
plea
taking
hearing
is
reprinted
in
its
entirety
on
pages
29
to
49
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
my
reading
of
that
hearing
is
rather
different
from
mr.
casebeer's.
i
just
leave
that
for
the
court
to
look
at,
if
it
believes
there
is
anything
important
in
those
facts.
mr.
casebeer
says
there
should
be
a
johnson
v.
zerbest
waiver
required
in
this
case,
criminal
defendants
lose
rights
all
the
time,
without
being
aware
of
them,
because
their
lawyers
fail
to
object
to
trial
or
fail
to
do
other
things.
the
question
that
raises
is
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
this
is
not
an
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
case.
i
don't
think...
it
has
not
been
contended,
and
i
don't
think
it
could
be
seriously
contended
that
it
was
outside
the
range
of
professional
competence
not
to
raise
this
issue
before
entering
into
this
very
advantageous
plea
agreement
for
these
defendants.
finally,
i'd
like
to
say
a
word
about
the
underlying
facts
of
beachner
and
of
this
case.
before
1973,
every
kansas
highway
construction
job
was
rigged,
virtually
every
job.
in
1973,
a
company
called
sanori
construction
company
went
out
of
business.
following
that,
our
antitrust
division
did
an
analysis
and
saw
that
only
about
10
percent
of
the
jobs
were
rigged.
the
rest
were
bid
competitively.
that
was
why
we
thought
then
and
we
still
think
today,
that
there
were
separate
conspiracies
in
this
case.
we
did
litigate
that
issue
and
lose
in
beachner.
we
have
not
asked
this
court
to
review
it,
but
we
certainly
were
proceeding
in
good
faith
in
trying
to
prosecute
these
conspiracies
separately
for
that
reason.
again,
we're
not
contesting
beachner,
but
i
can't
resist
adding,
we
think
that's
a
ridiculous
decision.
the
court
said
that
there's
a
common
objective
to
fix
prices
and
therefore
raise
profits.
therefore,
without
more,
there
is
one
conspiracy.
that
is
not--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
[laughter]
thank
you.
