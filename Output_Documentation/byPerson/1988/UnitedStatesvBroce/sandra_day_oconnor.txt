day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
they
just
hadn't
heard
about
the
beachner
case.
the
beachner
case
was
decided
later,
was
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
at
that
time,
then,
the
defense
counsel
thought
they
ought
to
take
advantage
of
that
and
try
to
get
that
finding
brought
forward
in
this
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
just
seems
like
the
defendants
in
this
case
freely
elected
to
forego
the
opportunity
to
raise
that
question.
