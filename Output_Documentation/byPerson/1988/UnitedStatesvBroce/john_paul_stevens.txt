justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
englert,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
i
know
you
don't
argue
this,
but
is
it
not
theoretically
possible,
at
least,
that
the
one
ongoing,
complete
conspiracy
that
went
on
for
many,
many
years
was
one
cries,
and
that
pursuant
to
that
conspiracy,
from
time
to
time,
the
defendants
would
enter
into
separate
bid-rigging
agreements
on
particular
jobs,
which
could
be
both
pursuant
to
the
overall
conspiracy
in
one
sense,
but
also
separate
violations
of
the
law
in
themselves.
so
that
couldn't
you,
at
least
theoretically,
say
that
there
were
two
conspiracies
even
though
there
was
one
ongoing
conspiracy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
but
why
couldn't
you
have,
say,
a
written
agreement
that
for
the
next
15
years,
we'll
all
agree
on
bids,
and
then
we'll
have
a
paragraph
agreement
that
says
that
every
time
a
bid
comes
up,
we'll
enter
into
another
written
agreement
fixing
the
specific
prices
on
this
deal?
and
wouldn't
both
of
those
be
separate
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws?
i
know
you
don't
argue
it,
but
i
just
wondered
why.
justice
john
paul
stevens
braverman,
you
think,
is
the
obstacle
to
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
on
that
point,
supposing
they
had
entered
into
a
written
agreement,
that
said
in
essence,
for
the
next
10
years,
we
will
meet
whenever
a
new
highway
project
is
announced,
and
we
will
agree
on
the
prices
for
it,
and
we'll
follow
certain
rules
when
we
do
it.
and
the
government
alleges
that
agreement
in
count
one
of
an
indictment.
then,
pursuant
to
that
agreement,
three
years
later,
they
do
meet
on
an
oklahoma
city
project.
it's
clearly
pursuant
to
the
original,
but
they
have
to
meet
separately
and
they
have
to
figure
specific
prices.
they're
indicted
on
that.
then
they
do
it
again
in
kansas
city,
pursuant
to
the
basic
agreement.
they
file
three
counts:
one,
the
long-term
agreement;
secondly,
the
kansas
city
project;
and
thirdly,
the
oklahoma
city
project...
three
counts.
would
you
say
that
indictment
is
duplicitous,
that
you
have
to
give
the
right
to
strike
two
counts
of
that
indictment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they're
trying
to
make
as
much
money
out
of
highway
projects
as
they
can.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
for
that
proposition
you
rely
on
braverman?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
holds
that
if
you
have
one
continuous
conspiracy,
you
can't
split
it,
but
you
could
be
indicted
for
separate
objects
if
the
separate
objects
are
themselves
criminal
offenses.
justice
john
paul
stevens
counsel,
you
say
the
statute
only
allows
for
one
prosecution.
suppose
all
the
facts
the
government
knew,
there
was
a
bid
in
oklahoma
city,
and
another
one
in
kansas
city,
each
of
which
was
rigged.
they
didn't
know
there
was
any
connection,
other
then
similar
parties,
and
the
defendants
knew
this
was
part
of
a
long-range
plan.
they'd
been
doing
it
for
years
and
years,
every
time
they
had
a
chance
but
the
government
only
knows
about
two
of
them.
the
defendants
think,
well,
we
really
better
not
tell
them
about
the
long-run
thing,
because
it
might
be
not
in
our
best
interest.
could
they
prosecute
the
two
of
them
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
under
the
facts
i
give
you,
could
they
be
subjected
to
two
prosecutions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
each
of
which
would
prove
all
the
elements,
an
agreement
to
fix
prices
in
a
particular
market,
one,
oklahoma
city,
and
another
in
kansas
city.
and
just...
they
don't
happen
to
know
about
this
long-range
backdrop.
they
could
go
to
jail
twice,
couldn't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
why
can't
they
go
to
jail
twice
if
they
go
ahead
and
tell
them
the
rest
of
the
facts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
suggesting
maybe
they
couldn't
be.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
if
each
of
the
crimes
is
an
object
of
a
long-run
conspiracy,
you
can't
split
that
long-run
conspiracy
into
different
crimes.
but
each
of
the
objects,
if
each
of
the
objects
that
is
itself
unlawful
can
be
prosecuted
separately.
that's
what
braverman
holds.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
here,
the
problem
is
that
you
got
involved
in
too
many
bids.
that's
why
you're
subject
to
prosecution
so
many
times.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
i'm
suggesting
the
object
of
a
long-run
conspiracy
can
be
a
particular
bid-rigging
job,
which
also
has
the
name
conspiracy.
but
there's
no
reason
why
you
can't
have
a
long-range
agreement,
and
then
pursuant
to
that
agreement
enter
into
separate
agreements
from
time
to
time
as
objects
of
the
long-run.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand,
but
braverman
doesn't
say
that.
