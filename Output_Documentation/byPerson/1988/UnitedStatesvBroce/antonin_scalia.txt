justice

scalia
mr.
englert,
is
it
really
true
that
you
could
say
so
categorically,
in
menna,
that
there
was
no
factual
admission
there?
why
couldn't
you
interpret
the
plea
to
the
second
indictment
in
menna
as
admitting
the
fact
that
there
was
no
prior
trial
and
punishment
for
this
same
offense,
just
as
here
you
want
to
interpret
it
as
admitting
that
there
are
two
separate
conspiracies
instead
of
just
one?
justice
antonin
scalia
whether
or
not
it
there
was
a
prior
trial
for
the
same
offense?
surely,
that's
a
fact.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
mean
it
would
be...
this
case
should
come
out
differently
if
it
were
undisputed
that
in
fact
there
was
only
one
conspiracy?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
not
at
the
time.
i
mean
now.
you
wouldn't
assert
that
if
you
now
admitted
there
was
just
one
conspiracy
that
your
case
is
gone.
you
would
still
i
say,
even
if
there
was
only
one,
it's
too
late
to
raise
that,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
why
it's
any
different
in
menna.
why
can't
you
regard
the
plea
in
menna
as
being
an
admission
that
there
was
no
prior
trial
for
that
offense?
it's
an
admission
that's
contrary
to
the
fact,
to
be
sure,
but
it's
an
admission
of
fact,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
once
again,
you
wouldn't,
you
wouldn't
say...
would
you
say
to
make
a
difference
in
this
case,
if
there
was
doubt
whether
there
was
one
conspiracy
or
two
at
the
time?
you
admit
there
was
doubt,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
but
that's
a
different
point
from
which
you've
been...
from
the
one
that
you've
been
urging
on
us.
it
isn't
a
matter
of
fact
versus
no
fact.
it's
a
matter
of
litigable
fact,
or,
you
know,
plausibly
disputed
fact,
versus
not
plausibly
disputed
fact.
is
that
the
line
you
want
us
to
draw?
justice
antonin
scalia
wait.
they
obviously
can't
do
that.
the
government
can't
do
that.
but
what
the
government
can
do
is
try
to
prove
that
there
were
26
separate
conspiracies,
instead
of
one.
they
could
have
done
that,
couldn't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
gave
up
their
right
to
do
that.
that's
something
of
great
value
that
your
client
got.
the
government
said,
"we
won't
try
to
prove
26.
"
"you
plead
to
two,
and
that'll
be
it.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
but
wasn't
that
the
deal?
i
can't
imagine
that
counsel
did
not
know
that
you
can't
split
one
conspiracy
up
into
26...
that
doesn't
take
a
whole
lot
of
imagination.
when
the
government
comes
in
and
says,
"we're
going
to
bring
26
separate
counts.
"
and
your
client
says,
"my
goodness,
why
26?
"
"this
is
one
conspiracy?
"
it
doesn't
take
a
very
good
lawyer
to
figure
out
what's
going
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
had
a
lawyer,
though,
didn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
they
felt
that
maybe
the
government
could
prove
26,
if
they
set
their
mind
to
it?
isn't
that
the
much
more
plausible
explanation?
i'd
rather
be
found
guilty
of
two
than
of
26,
and
that
was
the
deal.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
that
the
two
of
you
mean
the
same
thing
by
in
an
object
charge.
i
think
justice
stevens
means
you
can
prosecute
a
separate,
individual
conspiracy.
you
don't...
that's
not
what
you
mean
by
an
object.
you
mean
if
the
object
of
the
later
conspiracy
is
to
murder
somebody,
you
can
prosecute
the
murder,
not
the
conspiracy
to
murder.
