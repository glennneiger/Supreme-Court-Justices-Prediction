mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
thank
you.
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
broce.
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
respondent
submits
in
this
case
that
the
lower
court's
decision,
the
tenth
circuit's
decision,
is
absolutely
compelled
by
this
court's
reasoning
and
logic
in
menna
and
blackledge.
i'd
first
like
to
deal
with
the
factual
issues
that
counsel
for
the
government
has
referred
to,
because
there's
substantial
variation
in
our
interpretation
of
the
facts
and
their
interpretation
of
the
facts.
there
is
no
question
that
an
original
indictment
was
brought
against
broce
construction
and
ray
broce,
and
his
chief
foreman,
for
bid-rigging
activities
in
kansas.
and
it
named
a
certain
project.
we
are
not
here
disputing
the
factual
basis
for
that
indictment,
or
that
indeed
the
defendants
were
guilty
of
the
crime
as
alleged.
it
was
not
until
january
of
1982,
after
the
government
notified
mr.
broce,
when
he
was
set
to
go
to
trial,
that
in
the
event
you
proceed
to
trial,
we
will
bring
another
indictment
against
ray
broce,
broce
construction.
this
was
consistent,
as
we've
alleged
in
our
brief,
with
the
government's
position
in
each
case,
because
every
defendant
who
approached
trial
was
notified
that
they
were
going
to
be
indicted
again.
now,
when
the
significance
of
this
comes
about
when
you
look
at
the
government's
own
statement,
when
it
talks
about
the
government's
theory
of
the
case.
they
talk
about
the
fact
that
they
felt
ray
broce
and
they
have
evidence
to
believe
ray
broce
was
involved
in
at
least
26
of
these
such
activities,
on
various
projects.
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
the
official
statement.
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
yes.
the
government's...
what
they
titled
their
official
version
of
the
offense...
they
talk
about
the
fact
that
there
were
26
projects
between
may
of
1977
and
july
of
1980,
eight
of
which
went
to
broce,
and
two
of
those,
or
which
are
included
in
the
case
that's
before
this
court
now.
now,
the
government...
when
you
take
it
from
a
businessman's
point
of
view,
we're
now
in
a
position
where
the
government
is
alleging
that
we
may
have
potentially
26
future
trials.
now,
the
heart
of
this
whole
case
goes
to
the
government's
invasion
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
in
the
position
that
they
were
taking,
which
we
say
is
completely
contrary
to
braverman.
that--
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
--no,
excuse
me.
i
agree
with
you
totally.
the
double
jeopardy
did
not
attach
at
that
point.
the
position
the
defendant
was
placed
in
was
being
told,
as
a
businessman,
you
may
face
the
expense,
the
litigation
of
us
splitting
these
up
into
26
separate
trials.
now,
this
leads
a
defendant
to
take
certain
actions.
in
this
case,
the
defendant
instructed
his
attorneys
that
he
did
not
want
a
trial,
and
that
he
wanted
to
plead
guilty.
the
defendant's
attorneys
contacted
the
government
in
january
of
1982
and
notified
them
of
that
position.
unfortunately,
the
government
attorneys
were
already
aware
that
mr.
broce
had
so
instructed
his
attorneys.
it
was
at
that
point
that
the
government
told
mr.
broce's
attorneys
that
the
defendants
would
have
to
plead
guilty
to
two
indictments
for
conspiracy
or
face
multiple
trials.
that
is
put
out
in
the
affidavit
of
mr.
crockett,
who
is
the
attorney.
that
affidavit
was
never
refuted
by
the
government
and
that
was
the
basis...
and
that
is
the
sole
basis,
of
the
plea
negotiations
in
this
case
at
this
point
in
time.
at
this
point
in
time,
the
defendants
agreed
to
plead
guilty
to
two
indictments
on
different
projects,
in
exchange
for
the
government
not
bringing
succeeding
indictments
in
kansas.
there
is
no
mention
of
oklahoma
at
this
time.
there
is
in
fact
no
mention
of
the
mail
fraud
count.
at
this
point
in
time,
the
defendants
do
enter
into
court,
they
do
plead
guilty.
and
we
have
a
scenario
of
events
where
the
indictment
is
actually
handed
down
a
few
days
before
the
plea.
the
indictment
is
handed
to
the
defense
attorneys
the
morning
of
the
plea.
they
go
in,
they
plead
guilty
to
two
conspiracy
charges
as
alleged
by
the
government,
which
in
essence...
the
two
indictments
as
factually
analyzed,
say
nothing
about
the
nature
of
the
conspiracy.
all
they
do
is
identify
two
different
sections
of
highway
in
kansas
and
two
different
road
projects.
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
the...
that's
correct.
obviously
that
would
have
been
the
correct
posture
for
the
defense
attorneys
to
take,
but
they
didn't
have
difficulties
at
that
point
in
time,
because
as
stated
in
mr.
crockett's
affidavit,
they
never
considered...
these
attorneys
never
considered...
whether
or
not
pleading
to
two
conspiracies,
two
different
projects
involved
in
the
same
conspiracy,
involved
a
double
jeopardy
question.
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
i
think
that
is
in
part
correct.
i
would
rephrase
it
differently,
in
the
fact
that
i
believe
the
beachner
case
woke
defense
counsel
up
to
the
fact
that
the
government
can't
proceed
as
they
alleged
they
could.
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
this
court
has
said,
and
why
i
would
disagree
with
that,
this
court
has
said
that
the
right
belongs
to
the
defendant.
and
if
the
attorneys
never
advised
the
defendant
that
the
government
could
not,
by
the
constitution,
proceed
and
divide
up
a
conspiracy,
and
take
each
object
of
the
conspiracy,
which
is
a
given
highway
project,
the
letting
of
that
highway
project,
and
prosecute
that
individually...
prosecute
each
object
of
the
conspiracy
in
a
separate
count,
therefore
putting
the
defendant
in
a
position
of
facing
multiple
trials
and
multiple
expense,
or
the
convenience
of
a
plea
agreement.
if
the
defense
counsel--
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
--i
agree
with
you.
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
fiscally,
i
would
say
it's
of
great
value
to
tell
the
defendant,
obviously
we're
not
going
to
proceed
on
26
counts.
i
acknowledge
that
as
a
value.
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
number
one,
i
don't
think
the
defendant
would
realize
the
difference
of
the
nature
of
the
conspiracy,
whether
it's
ongoing
or--
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
--the
lawyer
states
in
his
affidavit
that
at
no
time
did
they
consider
it.
they
never
considered
the
double
jeopardy
aspects
of
this
case
at
all.
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
no.
the
tenth
circuit's
ruling,
as
i
understand
it,
is
under
the
terms
of
menna
and
blackledge.
once
we
see
the
defendant
has
been
convicted
twice
of
the
same
crime,
then
we
get
to
the
second
subject
of
this
case,
and
that
is
the
waiver
issue,
and
did
the
defendant
waive
it?
one
of
the
ways...
and
the
court
has
acknowledged
waiver
of
some
personal
rights...
and
one
of
the
ways
he
can
do
that
is
through
advice
of
his
counsel.
he
understands
that
he
has
a
double
jeopardy
claim
here,
and
he
is
willing
to
forego
that.
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
certainly
there
are
cases
such
as
ricketts
that
can
hold.
you
can
be
contractually
obligated
to
the
terms.
but
here
again,
we
differ
with
the
government's
version
of
the
facts,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
plea
agreement,
as
it
originally
formed,
is
in
mr.
crockett's
affidavit,
and
that
is
that
they
would
not
continue
to
seek
indictments
against
him
in
kansas,
in
exchange
for
a
plea
to
two
counts.
and
the--
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
--okay,
sequentially,
the
indictment
and
the
factual
statement,
the
factual
statement
apparently
was...
appeared
in
court
the
day
of
the
plea.
the
plea
agreement...
the
day
of
the
plea
they
had
apparently
not
finalized
the
plea
agreement.
the
plea
agreement
was
alluded
to
as
being
there,
but
changes
had
been
made
in
it.
now,
i
don't
know
what,
obviously,
that
means,
the
day
he's
pleading,
that
they're
telling
the
district
court
judge
that
"we
have
made
some
changes
in
the
plea
agreement.
"
my
understanding
of
the
factual
situation
is
that
the
government
wanted
mr.
broce's
assistance
in
oklahoma
on
various
projects
that
they
were
investigating
in
oklahoma.
at
no
time
was
a
kansas
contractor,
who
was
indicted
in
kansas,
ever
indicted
in
oklahoma.
mr.
broce
agreed
to
give
them
that
assistance
in
oklahoma,
and
it's
later
determined
that
the
plea...
he
apparently
gave
them
information
they
didn't
have...
or
at
least
his
lawyer
alleged
that.
but
at
that
time,
it
is
clear
from
the
plea
hearing
that
number
one,
the
defense
counsel
was
not
aware,
even,
that
there
was
going
to
be
a
mail
fraud
count
dismissed.
he
even
confuses
at
some
point
the
plea
agreement,
as
he
understands
it
at
the
plea
hearing,
to
give
his
client,
mr.
broce
and
broce
construction,
so
they
would
not
prosecute
him
in
nebraska.
it
is
clear
that
at
some
point
in
time,
after
the
defendants
initially
said,
rather
than
go
to
trial
and
face
multiple
indictments,
we
agree
to
plead
guilty.
now
we
don't
dispute,
under
the
holding
of
this
case
of
the
brady
trilogy
the
tollett
case...
obviously
if
we
were
saying
that
there
was
some
coercion
by
the
government,
of
threatening
to
violate
his
constitutional
rights
of
double
jeopardy
by
bringing
him
multiple
indictments,
and
we
were
moving
to
dismiss
the
first
count,
and
saying
that
was
in
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights...
then
those
cases
would
apply,
because
the
issue
of
his
factual
guilt
had
already
been
resolved.
our
position
on
the
second
count
is
not
the
issue
of
his
factual
guilt,
because
the
defendant
doesn't
repudiate
the
indictment,
he
doesn't
repudiate
the
government's
statement
of
facts.
what
he
does
say
is
that
at
this
point
in
times,
the
government
had
no
legal
right
to
haul
him
into
court
on
the
same
charge
they
brought
in
the
first
place.
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
that's
a
factual
determination.
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
no,
i
don't
think
you'd
be
in
the
same
position.
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
because
first
of
all,
you
have
an
appeal
right
that
you
could
have
taken
from
the
judge's
ruling,
and
you
may
have
foreclosed
your
position
by
not
taking
that
appeal.
when
the
govern...
when
the
judge
made
a
determination
that
you
had
a--
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
--if
you
waived
your
appeal.
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
there's
no
question
about
waiving
all
those
constitutional
rights.
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
we
have
no
problem
with
the
factual
guilt.
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
no,
i
disagree.
i
don't
believe
we've
conceded
there
were
two
conspiracies.
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
in
the
issue
as
to
whether
it
can
be
collaterally
attacked,
if
there
was
double
jeopardy
in
the
case
where
the
trial
court
found
two
conspiracies,
and
you
had
a
recourse
of
appeal,
then--
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
--and
you
waived
your
appeal,
then
i
think
you're
faced
with
a
different
problem
from
a
defendant
who
does
not
have
knowledge.
in
other...
a
waiver
of
an
appeal--
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
--a
knowledge
of
the
double
jeopardy
rights
that
he
has.
by
this,
what
i'm
addressing
is
this
fact
of
your
right
to
appeal.
a
defendant
may
not
waive
his
right
to
appeal.
there
may
be
circumstances
where
lack
of
knowledge
of
the
appeal,
the
court
may
not
find
a
waiver.
my
issue,
which
i
present
before
this
court
today,
is
that
this
is
a
defendant
without
the
knowledge
and
ability
to
waive.
and
it
may
turn
out
the
same
way,
although
very
unlikely,
that
in
a
case
where
a
defendant
is
unaware
of
his
right
of
appeal,
that
he
may
not
have
waived
it.
going
to
the
issue
of
the
effect
of
the
plea
of
guilty,
the
defendant
admitted
the
factual
basis
of
the
two
indictments,
and
the
defendant,
as
i
said,
does
not
repudiate
those
today.
there
is
no
question
he
was
involved
as
the
government
describes
this,
as
a
conspiracy
in
excess
of
25
years,
that
made
bidrigging
a
way
of
life
in
the
state
of
kansas.
but
the
government
also
makes
those
allegations
in
its
official
version
of
the
events,
even
though
it
seeks
contrary
to
braverman
to
split
up
that
conspiracy.
the
government
makes
a
point
that
in
1973,
the
nature
of
the
conspiracy
changed,
and
that
is
factually
accurate.
prior
to
1973,
the
state
of
kansas
would
announce
in
advance
its
projects
that
it
was
going
to
let
for
the
future
year.
after
1973,
it
stopped
that
practice
and
announced
them
as
they
came
about
during
the
year.
the
government
felt
that
was
sufficient
to
establish
that
a
conspiracy
to
rig
highway
projects
no
longer
existed,
only
a
conspiracy
to
rig
individual
projects.
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
i
would
say
in
response
to
that
and
i
would
say
that
i
cannot
answer
that
question.
i
would
think
that
it
would
come
under
the
wilshire,
the
common
objective.
what
was
the
common
objective?
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
then
i'd
say
it
was
multiplicious
and
duplicitous
and
it
violates
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
you
could
be
indicted
for
the
separate
objects
if
they
do
give
rise
to
separate
criminal
offenses,
where
the
common
objective
of
those
parties
is
to
do
something
other
than
the
conspiracy
that
is
raised
in
count
one
or
count
two,
and
obviously
we
contend
that
is
not
the
facts
in
this
case.
but
i
would
take
that
position.
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
regarding
the
indictments
that
were
handed
down,
in...
of
essence
in
this
case
is
the
indictments,
because
that
is
the
basis
on
which
the
defendant
is
brought
into
court,
that
is
the
basis
upon
which
the
defendant
is
advised
by
counsel,
and
which
the
court
proceeds.
the
purpose
of
the
indictment,
obviously,
we
feel,
is
to
inform
the
defendant
of
the
nature
of
the
crime
that
he
is
being
charged
with.
we
do
allege
these
indictments
are
vague,
and
an
analysis
has
been
made
by
both
judge
bohanon
and
the
tenth
circuit
judges
of
the
indictment,
and
they're
virtually
identical.
the
only
thing
they
do
is
take
a
different
section
of
the
kansas
highway
projects.
the
official
version,
although
it
does
mention
two
conspiracies,
it
also
acknowledges
that
there
was
one
overall
conspiracy,
referring
to
a
way
of
life,
and
multiple
projects,
as
i've
stated
before,
within
a
short
period
of
time,
which
ray
broce,
that
they
felt
he
was
involved
in
a
conspiracy
on
these
projects.
it
defies
common
sense
and
logic
to
say
that
there
was
only
one
conspiracy
on
a
single
project,
and
the
common
objective
of
all
those
bidders
on
that
project
was
to
let
broce
construction
have
that
project.
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
the
object
of
what
your
question
is,
as
i
understand
it,
is
can
it
be
waived
at
some
point
in
time.
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
obviously
you
prefer
to
fight
it
at
the
time
of
the
indictment.
that's
the
appropriate
time
to
do
it.
this
is
a
case
where
the
indictment
was
handed
to
the
attorneys
the
day
they
went
into
plead.
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
i
agree.
i
can't
explain
why
they
took
the
actions
they
did,
other
than
they
felt
for
some
reason
because
of
lack
of
knowledge
of
the
double
jeopardy
aspects
that
the
government
had
a
right
to
do
what
the
government
claimed
it
had
a
right
to
do,
and
that
was
to
divide
the
projects
up.
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
i
would
agree
that
it's
very
likely
that
they
felt
that
their
client
was
guilty
of
being
involved
in
the
setting
up,
or
attempting
to
set
up,
26
projects.
i
do
not
think
it's
plausible,
based
upon
their
affidavits,
that
they
never
considered
these
aspects,
that
the
attorneys
considered
the
nature
of
what
the
government
was
doing
and
the
rights
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
i
do
not
believe
that's
plausible.
that's
just...
they
just
never
considered
it,
and
i've
interviewed
them,
and
it
just
never
occurred
to
them.
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
yes,
in
certain
degrees
the
government
does
pay
some
price
for
this.
but,
and
again,
it
was
the
government...
the
government
was
obviously
aware
of
braverman
before
they
brought
these
indictments.
this
was
a
case
where
the
government
was
aware
that
the
defense
counsels
were
coming
in
to
plead
guilty,
and
they
decided
to
seek
two
indictments.
this
is
the
only
kansas
contractor
that
they
took
that
approach
with,
and
they
have
to
also
bear
some
responsibility
for
knowledge
that
the
maximum
penalty,
whether
you
agree
with
it
or
not,
by
statute
is
$1
million.
in
this
case,
they
sought
to
double
the
penalty
of
$750,000
and
exceed
the
maximum
penalty
permitted
by
statute.
they
also
took
their
gambles
by
doing
so,
in
the
fact
that
if
the
actions
they
took
were
improper
according
to
the
constitution,
that
they
had
no
right
to
take
their
actions,
then
they
gambled
to
get
an
extra
$500,000.
now,
in
this
case,
as
far
as
the
oklahoma
projects,
in
the
remaining
time
i'd
like
to
direct
my
attention
to
that.
there's
some
indication
that
there...
obviously,
there's
some
agreement
in
the
plea
agreement,
there
were
some
changes
made
in
the
plea
agreement
to
require
mr.
broce's
cooperation
in
oklahoma.
in
oklahoma
he
was
given,
on
certain
projects,
immunity
to
testify.
and
in
this
case,
what
the
tenth
circuit
simply
said
was
that
the
government
having
once
taken
their
position
in
order
to
try
to
manipulate
this
situation,
for
lack
of
a
better
term,
cannot
complain
now
that
they've
lost
some
type
of
prosecutor
advantage,
because
of
the
actions
that
they
took
which
were
invalid
according
to
constitutional
standards
to
begin
with.
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
the
government,
in
particular
to
mislead,
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
took
the
position
that
they
were
going
to
prosecute
one
person
right
after...
you
know,
one
time
right
after
another.
we
are
going
to
haul
you
into
court
time
and
time
again
if
you
do
not
plead.
now,
that
in
itself
is
within
probably
a
prosecutor's
discretion
of
taking
a
tough
line
position.
but
it
was
clear
from
the
evidence...
we
have
not
mentioned
here
the
fact
that
the
facts
show
that
the
government
had
only
one
conspiracy
to
deal
with,
and
the
facts
were
the
same
to
the
government
as
they
were
to
the
courts
and
the
defense
counsel.
and
by
taking
the
position
that
they
would
ignore
the
fact
that
the
statute
only
allowed
one
prosecution
and
one
penalty
for
this
crime,
but
in
essence
you
may
not
pay
that
penalty...
you
may
be
found
not
guilty,
but
we
will
penalize
you
more
by
bringing
you
back
to
court
time
and
time
again.
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
to
a
degree
it
is.
i
share
your
concern...
i
understand
it's
not
come
out
directly.
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
i
think
that's
the
correct
term,
ill-advised.
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
the
defendants
are
indeed
in
a
disadvantaged
position,
because
obviously
they
cannot
go
to
kansas
and
say,
"we
are
in
a
long-term
conspiracy.
"
or--
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
--they
could
be
subjected
to
two
prosecutions
if...
and
this
goes
back
to
the--
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
--that's
correct,
and
the
fundamental--
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
--the
fundamental
difference
that
i
see
with
the
scenario
you
put
forth
is
you
said
the
defendants
were
aware.
and
if
the
defendants
were
aware
of
it,
and
they
were
aware
that
the
government
could
be
limited
to
one
conspiracy
charge--
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
--you
mean
that
if
they
weren't--
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
--the
object
itself
can
be
prosecuted
separately.
i
agree.
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
if
the
government
had
chosen
to
proceed
that
way.
and
in
none
of
these
cases--
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
--that
is
correct
to
some
degree.
but
the
government
never
proceeded
that
way.
all
their
procedures
were
under
the
conspiracy,
and
the
only
thing
i
can
argue
is
the
charges
they
brought,
which
were
conspiracy.
if
there
was
a
conspiracy
charge
and
an
object
charge,
you
don't
have
a
double
jeopardy
problem
and
we're
not--
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
--you're...
that's
the
way
i
was
referring
to
it.
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
i
would
answer
the
same
way
i
answered
before.
if
they
have
the
common
objective,
i
still
think
the
double
jeopardy
holds.
mr.
glenn
e.
casebeer,
iii
in
this
situation,
the
defendant
raised
his
challenge
in
the
district
court,
which
is
affirmed
in
the
tenth
circuit,
and
all
of
those
tenth
circuit
opinions
give
a
very
detailed
analysis
of
the
various
cases
and
the
actual
facts.
there
was
a
factual
record
stipulated
to
by
the
parties,
and
that
was
the
beachner
record.
that
record
conclusively
showed
only
one
conspiracy.
that
issue
was
taken
to
the
tenth
circuit
and
affirmed
there.
no
cert
was
requested
by
this
court.
the
government
was
in
a
position
where
they
knew
that
the
defendant
had,
in
essence,
been
subject
to
a
prosecution
twice
for
the
same
crime.
that
is
the
only
essence
of
what
we're
bringing
before
this
court
now,
was
not
whether
he
was
guilty
or
innocent,
but
whether
they
had
the
legal
right
to
bring
the
charge
in
the
second
place.
the
difference
we
would
see
in
ricketts
and
where
we
recognize
that
the
court
to
some
degree
has
held
that
a
person
can
contract
away
their
double
jeopardy
rights
by
their
agreement
is
number
one,
we
hold
that
no
contractor
in
kansas
was
prosecuted
in
oklahoma.
secondly,
there
was
no
indictment
against
broce
in
oklahoma,
no
indictment
indicated
against
broce
in
oklahoma.
the
plea
agreement
to
require
broce's
cooperation
in
oklahoma
was
to...
the
immunity
in
oklahoma
was
to
obtain
his
cooperation.
thank
you,
gentlemen,
ladies.
