justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
the...
how,
were
they
sentenced
separately
for
the
two
conspiracies?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
some
acknowledgement
that
they
might
have
been
sentenced
consecutively?
justice
byron
r.
white
explicit?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose,
counsel,
suppose
you
hadn't
pled
guilty.
your
client
hadn't
pled
guilty
and
had
gone
to
trial
and
your
claim
was
there
was
only
one
conspiracy;
you
can't
convict
us
of
two
conspiracies.
and
the
trial
court
says,
well,
i
guess
i'll
have
to
decide
that
issue,
and
the
court
decides
there
were
two
conspiracies.
is
that
a
factual
determination?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
suppose
the
trial
court
decides
that,
and
you're
sentenced
for
two
conspiracies,
just
like
you
were
here,
and
then
later
some
other
court
says
there's
only
one.
and
then
you
come
back
on
federal
habeas,
or
some...
ask
for
relief.
would
you
be
in
the
same
position
where
you
are
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
be
bound
with
the...
you
would
be
bound
by
the
judge's
factual
finding?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
if
you
waived
your
appeal.
well,
you
certainly
did
more
than
that
in
your
plea
agreement.
you
waived
a
trial
as
well
as
an
appeal.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
thought
that
we
had
said
that
the
plea
agreements
at
least
establish
factual
guilt.
valid...
it's
a
valid
determination
of
factual
guilt.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
one
of
the
facts
which
you
just
conceded
is
whether
or
not
there
are
two
conspiracies.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
if
the
trial
court
had
determined
there
were
two
conspiracies,
you
could
not
have
collaterally
attacked
that
later.
