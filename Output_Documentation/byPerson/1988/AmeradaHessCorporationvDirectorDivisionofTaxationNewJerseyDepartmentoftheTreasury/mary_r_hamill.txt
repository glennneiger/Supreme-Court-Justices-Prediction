ms.
mary
r.
hamill
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
really
like
to
make
just
two
points
on
behalf
of
new
jersey
today.
the
first
is
that
new
jersey
is
not
discriminating
against
interstate
commerce
nor
skewing
the
income
base
of
the
corporation
tax
by
denying
a
deduction
for
the
windfall
profit
tax.
all
new
jersey
is
doing
is
applying
a
longstanding
statutory
provision
which
denies
a
deduction
for
all
federal
income
or
profits-based
taxes,
regardless
of
where
the
taxed
activity
takes
place.
and
i
think
the
chief
justice
picked
up
on
this
point
in
his
first
question
to
mr.
evans.
we
deny
a
deduction
for
all
federal
income-based
taxes,
and
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
concluded
that
this
was
an
income-based
tax.
the
second
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
that
the
company's
proposed
constitutional
rule
would
be
difficult
to
apply,
as
i
think
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
and
would
severely
restrict
the
state's
ability
to
define
net
income,
and
the
court
has
made
clear
that
there
is
a
very
large
leeway
that
the
states
have
in
defining
net
income.
the
case
where
the
court
indicated
that
was
atlantic
coastline
railway
v.
daughton.
to
to
back
now
to
my
point
that
all
we're
doing
is
applying
a
longstanding
statutory
provision,
since
1958
new
jersey
has
had
a
corporate
franchise
tax
measured
by
income
that
taxes
unitary
net
income
apportioned
to
new
jersey,
and
included
in
that
unitary
net
income,
as
this
court
has
held
is
permissible,
is
income
attributable
to
the
production
of
crude
oil
in
other
states.
since
1958,
more
than
20
years
before
the
enactment
of
the
windfall
profit
tax,
new
jersey
has
had
a
statutory
provision
that
denies
a
deduction
for
taxes
paid
or
accrued
to
the
united
states
on
or
measured
by
profits
or
income.
that
provision
applies
to
all
federal
income
or
profits-based
taxes,
including
the
federal
income
tax,
the
federal
minimum
tax.
it
would
apply
to
federal
excess
profits
taxes,
and
we
believe
it
applies
to
the
windfall
profit
tax,
and
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
so
held
because
it
concluded
that
the
windfall
profit
tax
is
an
income-based
tax.
i
don't
understand
the
appellants--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--yes.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
i
think
it
could
under
its
present
taxing
scheme
because
new
jersey,
while
it
allows
a
deduction
currently...
are
you
speaking
of
the
windfall
profit
tax
specifically
or
any--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--well,
i
think
new
jersey
could
deny
a
deduction
for
severance
taxes.
it
in
fact
does
not
because
it
follows
the
federal
income
tax
treatment
of
severance
taxes,
and
they
are
deductible.
new
jersey
has
no
severance
tax,
so
that
even
if
the
windfall
profit
tax,
under
the
solicitor
general's
theory,
is
akin
to
a
severance
tax,
i
don't
see
the
in-state
favoritism.
how
can
there
be
any
favoritism
if
we
don't
have
that
tax?
we
don't
have
severance
taxes.
so
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
if
the
windfall
profit
tax
is
characterized
as
a
severance
tax,
it
seems
to
me.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
well,
again,
though,
but
the
question
is
whether
you
are
really
doing
something
that
is
advantaging
the
in-state
economy,
at
least
as
i
read
the
court's
commerce
clause
cases,
and
i
can't
see
that
you're
forcing
out-of-state
activity
into
the
state
if
you
deny
a
deduction
for
a
cost
that
can't
be
performed
in
the
state.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
if
you
don't
have
it,
if
you
simply
don't
have
a
particular--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--no,
i
don't
think
it
could.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
because
i
think
there
would
be
labor
costs
incurred
by
these
oil
companies
in
state.
they
wouldn't
be
in
producing
oil--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--no,
we
couldn't...
i
don't
think
we
could
deny
that
deduction.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
but
we
would
have
other
costs
incurred
by
these
oil
companies
that
would
be
labor
costs.
i
think
the
comparison--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--i
don't
think
we
could.
i
don't
think
we
could.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
well,
because
what
i...
i
do
think
that
the
difference
would
be
that
we
clearly
have
labor
costs,
they're
not
on
oil
and
gas,
that's
true,
production
of
oil
and
gas,
but
we
have
labor
costs
that
are
costs
in
states,
and
we
would
be
allowing
those
deductions.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
so
there
would
be
a
disparity.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
but
there's
no
distinction,
justice
white,
based
here
on
the
citizenship
of
the
companies.
we
are
taxing...
we
deny
this
deduction
to
all
companies
that
do
business
in
new
jersey
that
pay
the
windfall
profit
tax.
we
are
not
even
singling
out
integrated
producers.
we
deny
the
deduction
to
a
wholly
intrastate
real
estate
development
company,
for
instance
that
might
have
a
partnership
investment
in
a
drilling,
oil
drilling
ventures.
that
company
would
pay
the
windfall
profit
tax,
and
we
would
deny
it
just
the
way
we
would
deny
that
company
a
deduction
for
the
federal
income
tax.
you
see,
we
are
treating
this
windfall
profit
tax
as
an
income-based
tax.
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
held
it
was
an
income-based
tax.
in
that
respect
it
is
similar
under
our
law
to
the
federal
income
tax.
the
federal
income
tax
could
clearly
be
imposed
really
almost
exclusively
with
respect
to
out-of-state
activities;
we
would
deny
the
deduction.
it
could
be
imposed
exclusively
with
respect
to
in-state
activities;
we
would
deny
the
deduction.
so
in
our
view,
the
so-called
site-specific
nature
of
the
windfall
profit
tax
is
just
irrelevant.
it's
another
federal
income-based
tax.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
your
honor,
if
new
jersey...
on
new
jersey
receipts?
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
yes,
it
certainly
could,
and
in
fact,
in
appendix
i
think
it
is
c
to
our
brief,
we
show
that
a
gross
receipts
tax
of
1
percent
or
less
on
these
companies'
new
jersey
receipts
would
have
yielded
a
greater
tax
liability
than
their
liability
under
the
apportioned
net
income,
tax
without
a
deduction
for
the
windfall
profit
tax.
so
there
is...
this
talk
we've
heard
about
the
excessiveness
of
the
tax
effect
is
really
not
supported
by
what's
going
on.
they
had
very,
very
large
new
jersey
receipts.
moreover,
for
all
we
know,
their
incomes
in
those
years
may
have
increased
enormously
from
the
pre-decontrolled
period,
so
that
the
simple
increase
in
their
liability
in
new
jersey
is
not,
standing
alone,
something
that
should
be
taken
to
be
suggestive
that
the
windfall
profit
tax
treatment,
denial
of
the
deduction,
is
unconstitutional.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
well,
i
think
in
conceptually,
theoretically,
one
could
possibly
do
that,
but
in
fact
the
problem
is
that
the
court
has
held
that
gross
receipts
may
be
taxed
by
the
state
where
the
receipt
is
realized,
so
that
if
you
had
that
taxing
scheme
that's
fairly
well
accepted,
and
then
some
states
started
to
apportion
gross
receipts,
you
might
very
well
have
double
taxation
of
those
receipts.
so
in
practice,
i
think
it
would
be
hard
to
do
that.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
well,
that's
certainly--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--well,
that's
certainly
part
of
the
commerce
clause
analysis.
i
was
focusing
more
on
just
pure
discrimination,
but
that's
certainly
true.
i
don't
think
in
this
case
there's
the
slightest
tenable
argument
that
we
are
reaching
out
and
taxing
a
transaction
that's
outside
of
new
jersey.
we
are
denying
a
deduction
against
the
unitary
net
income
which
is
then
apportioned
to
new
jersey.
the
amount
of
the
deduction
is
equal
to
the
windfall
profit
tax,
but
there's
no
reaching
out
and
imposing
a
windfall
profit
tax
on
transactions
elsewhere.
there
really
is
no
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce
here,
i
really
believe,
for
the
same
reason
that
i
made
in
the
very
beginning,
that
we
are
simply
treating
the
windfall
profit
tax
as
an
income-based
tax,
and
in
that
respect,
like
the
federal
income
tax.
if
we
deny
a
deduction
for
the
federal
income
tax
with
respect
to
activities
incurred
in
new
jersey,
it
seems
to
me
there's
no
discrimination
in
denying
a
deduction
for
the
federal
windfall
profit
tax
that's
incurred
outside
new
jersey.
i'd
like
to
go
back
to,
a
minute
to
the
question
that
justice
white
raised
of
whether
the
windfall
profit
tax
is
a
production
cost
similar
to
a
severance
tax
because
i
really
think
that
we
don't
have
to
reach
that
question
of
whether
we
would
deny
a
deduction
for
severance
taxes
here
because
this
is
not
akin
to
a
severance
tax.
this
tax
is
always
a
net
amount.
it
is
an
income
computation.
the
company
is
allowed
to
deduct
at
least
its
actual
costs
at
the
wellhead.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
at
the
wellhead,
that's
absolutely
true,
but
there
are,
there
are
many,
many
definitions
of
income,
and
many
states
treat
production
income
at
the
wellhead
as...
producing
states,
as
the
basis
for
imposing
a
state
income
tax.
percentage
depletion
under
the
federal
internal
revenue
code
is
computed
based
on
income
at
the
wellhead.
there's
no
magic
in
the
fact
that
we
are
taxing
a
segment
of
income
and
not
overall
income.
we
also
believe
that
the
windfall
profit
tax
really
is
not
site-specific,
if
we
got
to
that
point
at
all.
we
first
believe
it
is
just
irrelevant,
but
even
if
the
windfall
profit
tax,
if
we
get
to
the
question
of
whether
it's
site-specific,
it
seems
to
us
that
when
you
start
computing
the
windfall
profit
tax
with
the
removal
price,
which
for
an
integrated
company
like
these
is
the
posted
price
of
oil
in
the
field,
and
the
posted
price
is
the
price
that
a
refiner
would
pay
for
that
oil
in
the
field
but
taking
into
account
the
value
of
the
oil
at
the
refinery,
it
seems
to
us
that
you're
measuring
that
windfall
profit
tax
by
offsite
factors
and
thus,
while
the
activity
may
take
place
at
a
certain
place,
the
measurement
of
that
activity
is
not
site-specific.
it
relates
to
factors
elsewhere.
and
the
prime
example
of
that
which
we
discuss
in
our
brief
is
the
case
of
alaska
north
slope
oil.
since
there
are
no
markets
on
the
north
slope,
these
companies
value
their
crude
oil
for
windfall
profit
tax
purposes
by
determining
the
market
value
of
that
crude
in
the
lower
48
states,
based
on
what
the
oil
would
bring
in
those
markets.
the
price
may
vary
from
the
gulf
coast
to
the
east
coast
to
the
west
coast,
and
then
they
net
back
from
that
figure
to
reach
the
wellhead
price.
but
since
they
start
with
a
figure
that's
in
the
lower
48
states,
and
for
exxon
that
figure
is
the
value
of
the
oil
for
exxon's
oil
sent
to
the
east
coast,
it's
the
value
of
that
oil
at
exxon's
refinery
in
linden,
new
jersey,
i
don't
see
how
that
can
be
called
a
site-specific
cost
when
that's
the
basis
for
the
computation
of
the
windfall
profit
tax.
justice
kennedy
had
a
question
about
whether
there
was
any
authority
for
the
court
striking
down
a
state
law
which
was
unobjectionable
when
enacted,
but
the
economic
facts
have
changed,
and
that
therefore
it
becomes
objectionable,
and
the
case
that
came
to
my
mind
when
that
question
was
raised
was
the
very
recent
case
of
shell
oil
v.
iowa.
iowa,
like
new
jersey,
has
a
unitary
net
income
tax.
the
tax
statute
was
enacted
before
development
on
the
outer
continental
shelf
began,
before
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
was
enacted,
but
the
court
held
that
since
congress
had
not
preempted
the
states
from
taxing
income
earned
in
part
on
the
outer
continental
shelf,
iowa
could
tax
this
outer
continental
shelf
income,
or
it
could
tax
the
income
derived
from
that
outer
continental
shelf
income,
and
so
the
iowa
tax
continued
to
be
valid
despite
the
change
in
circumstances,
despite
the
fact
that
you
had
development
of
oil
and
gas
somewhere
else.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
that's
right,
but
that
would
have
been
a
a
changed
federal
law--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--your
honor,
and
that
could
very
well
have
happened
here.
congress
could
very
well
have
preempted
new
jersey
from
denying
a
deduction
for
the
windfall
profit
tax.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
that's
true,
but--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--well,
that's
true,
too.
we
have
a...
that's
absolutely
true,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
i
understand.
we
tend
to
think
that
that
colors
the
situation,
that
there's
clearly
no
discriminatory
intent
here.
we
just
are
applying
our
statutory
provision
that's
been
on
the
books
for
a
long
time
to
a
newly
enacted
federal
statute,
and
we
analogize
that
to
the
federal
income
tax
for
which
we
deny
a
deduction.
the
final
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
is
just
to
reiterate
the
point
that
was
made
in
questions
to
my
opponent.
this
constitutional
rule
that
the
appellants
propose
would
be
very
difficult
to
apply.
new
york,
which
is
an
amicus
in
this
case,
had
853,000
barrels
of
crude
oil
production
in
1986
and
denies
a
deduction
for
the
windfall
profit
tax.
kansas
denies
a
deduction
for
the
windfall
profit
tax,
and
in
1986
had
67
million
barrels
of
crude
oil
production.
so
despite
mr.
evans'
point
that
the
in-state
political
forces
would
operate
to
prevent
a
state
legislature
from
denying
a
deduction
for
the
windfall
profit
tax
if
there
was
crude
oil
production
in
the
state,
that
seems
not
to
have
been
the
case
in
the
case
of
kansas.
but
anyway,
going
back
to
these
figures,
the
question
is
does
new
york
have
too
little
crude
oil
to
deny
a
deduction
for
the
windfall
profit
tax?
does
kansas
have
enough?
where
would
the
line
be
drawn?
the
rule
would
also
severely
restrict
the
states'
ability
to
define
net
income,
and--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--texas
doesn't
have
a
corporate
income
tax,
your
honor.
[laughter]
even
better.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
yes.
as
shown
in
appendix
b
to
new
jersey's
brief,
over
30
states
follow
the
federal
income
tax
treatment
of
depletion.
some
of
these
states,
including
new
jersey,
have
no
crude
oil
but
do
have
hard
minerals.
those
states
which
have
hard
minerals
and
no
crude
oil
are
currently
in
violation
of
the
companies'
proposed
constitutional
rule
because
the
depletion,
the
federal
income
tax
depletion
deduction
for
oil
and
gas
is
generally
less
favorable
than
the
depletion
deduction
for
hard
minerals.
so
they
are
doing...
and
that's
a
great
many
states
that
would
be
in
violation
of
this
rule.
this
example
shows
the
difficulty
that
the
states
would
be
put
in
if
the
companies'
rule
were
accepted.
before
following
the
federal
income
tax
treatment
of
a
particular
cost,
the
states
would
have
to
survey
the
domestic
economy,
determine
if
a
particular
activity
occurred
in
state
and
how
much
of
it
occurred
in
state,
and
then
take
action
in
the
state
legislature.
we
believe
that
the
court
to
date
has
not
construed
the
commerce
clause
in
such
a
rigid
fashion.
there
seems
to
us
to
be
no
need
to
change
that
rule
now
and
adopt
a
more
rigid
one
when
there's
really
no
singling
out
of
out-of-state
crude
oil
production;
we
are
simply
applying
our
unitary
tax.
we
are
including
oil
production
values
in
the
net
income
base
just
the
way
the
court
has
said
we
could.
in
fact,
all
we're
doing
really
is
preserving
the
net
income
base
in
an
amount
which
was
equal
to
what
it
was
before
congress
enacted
the
windfall
profit
tax.
it's
simply...
the
windfall
profit
tax
is
simply
a
segment
of
the
windfall
profit.
the
windfall
profit
is
that
crude
oil
production
income
or
value.
it
may
not
be
included
dollar
for
dollar
in
the
unitary
net
income
base,
but
that
net
profit,
that
windfall
profit
flows
through
to
the
bottom
line,
and
it
is
simply
unitary
net
income,
the
same
amount
of
unitary
net
income
that
we
always
taxed
that
we
believe
we
should
be
able
to
continue
to
tax.

no,
i
don't,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
i
think
they
are
all
right,
but
i
just
would
point
out
that
what
this
table
doesn't
show,
and
i
believe
it's
in
the
record
but
i'm
not
sure.
you'd
have
to
look
back
at
the
annual
reports
of
these
companies
for
the
years
at
issue
and
compare
those
years
to
'78
and
'79,
but
these
companies,
perhaps
with
the
exception
of
cities
service,
were
vastly
more
profitable
in
these
years,
so
that
while
these
percentage
increases
may
appear
large,
you
can't
take
those
numbers
in
a
vacuum
and
assume
that
the
are--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--yes.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
that's
all
i
have
to
say.
