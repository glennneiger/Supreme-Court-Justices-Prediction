mr.
mark
l.
evans
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
these
appeals
are
about
new
jersey's
novel
attempt
to
raise
its
own
state
tax
revenues
at
the
expense
of
only
out-of-state
economic
interests.
most
of
the
paths
to
that
tempting
goal
have
been
shut
off
over
the
years
by
this
court's
decisions
which
have
made
it
crystal
clear
that
while
interstate
business
must
bear
its
fair
share
of
local
tax
burdens,
it
must
be
made
to
bear
no
more
than
its
fair
share.
but
new
jersey
seems
to
feel
it
has
found
a
loophole.
under
the
formula
apportionment
method
of
taxation,
a
state
first
determines
the
total
income
from
the
entire
enterprise
from
sources
both
inside
and
outside
the
state
and
then
takes
a
slice
of
that
income
for
itself
by
using
a
fair
apportionment
formula.
the
court's
decisions
have
insisted
that
the
formula
be
geographically
neutral
so
that
the
state
does
not
impute
to
itself
a
greater
portion
of
total
net
income
than
can
be
reasonably
attributed
to
the
company's
activities
within
the
state.
what
new
jersey
has
done
is
used
a
perfectly
reasonable
apportionment
formula,
but
it
has
applied
it
to
a
geographically
skewed
base.
it
has
not
skewed
the
base
by
adding
out-of-state
revenues
to
it
in
an
inappropriate
way
or
overstating
out-of-state
revenues;
what
it
has
done
is
found
a
cost
that
is
incurred
only
outside
the
state,
only
by
crude
oil
producers,
and
has
disallowed
it.
the
result
of
that
has
been
to
drastically
raise
the
income
that
new
jersey
taxes
from
the
oil
companies.
and
the
question
that
is
raised,
in
our
view,
by
this
is
whether
a
state
can
sidestep
the
usual
apportionment
mechanisms
on
the
theory
that
income
tax
deductions
are
purely
a
matter
of
legislative
grace.
i'd
like,
if
i
may,
to
start
with
describing
a
little
bit
of
the
context
in
which
this
case
arises.
the
appellants
are
all
integrated
interstate
petroleum
companies.
they
do
business
in
new
jersey,
but
they
produce
crude
oil
only
outside
new
jersey.
there
is
no
crude
oil
produced
at
all
in
new
jersey.
during
the
years
at
issue
each
of
the
companies
incurred
very
substantial
windfall
profit
tax
liabilities.
that
tax
operates
much
as
a
severance
tax
does:
it
is
imposed
on
the
removal
of
each
barrel
of
crude
oil
from
the
producing
premises,
and
it
is
measured
by
a
portion
of
the
barrel's
wellhead
value.
under
new
jersey's
formula
apportionment
method,
it
requires
the
appellants
to
include
in
their
preapportionment
base
all
of
their
income
from
all
sources.
that
means
that
the
base
includes
the
income
from,
derived
from
the
production
activities
outside
the
state.
at
the
same
time,
new
jersey
law,
as
construed
by
the
state
supreme
court,
disallows
a
deduction
for
these
billions
of
dollars
of
windfall
profit
taxes
that
appellants
incurred
solely
in
the
course
of
those
out-of-state
production
activities.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
we
do
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
distinction,
as
i
hope
to
develop
a
little
bit
further
in
a
moment,
is
that
the
activities
that
give
rise
to
the
federal
income
tax
liability
are
activities
that
take
place
everywhere,
including
new
jersey,
and
as
a
consequence,
the
cost
of
federal
income
taxes
is
not
site-specific
and
geographically
localized
to
any
specific
activity.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
sure.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
there
actually
are,
there
are
13
companies
involved.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
they
vary
quite
a
lot,
justice
stevens.
there
is
a
chart
in
the
back
of
our
brief,
on
the
second...
well,
it
says
page
3a
of
the
appendix
to
our
blue
brief,
which
reflects
the
allocation
factor
for
each
of
the
companies
in
the
left-hand
column
for
1980,
and
then
there
are
slightly
different
ones
for
the
companies
who
have
1981
year
as
an
issue.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
correct.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
think
the
issues
would
be
altogether
different,
justice
stevens.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
we
would
not
have
the
objection
that
we're
raising
here.
there
may
be
other
objections,
but
they're
not
what
we're
arguing
about.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
exactly,
exactly.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
there
might
be--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--right.
there
might
be
some
element
of
disproportion,
but
the
court
has
never
insisted
on
and
we
don't
ask
for
mathematically
precise
apportionment
mechanisms.
it
has
always
recognized
that
states
need
a
margin
of
error,
and
it
has
used
phrases
like
rough
approximation,
and
we
have
no
objection
to
that.
what
we
do
think
is
that
the
court
can
reasonably
expect
that
before
a
state
disallows
a
large
deduction,
that
it
have
some
substantial
in-state
effect,
some
impact
on
the
in-state
economy
that
serves
as
some
kind
of
a
check
against
the
imposition
of
burdensome
taxation.
that
is
not
the
case
here,
and
in
fact,
it
has
zero
impact
because
there's
absolutely
not
a
drop
of
oil
being
produced
in
new
jersey.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
don't--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--i
think
that
there
are
some
techniques
that
the
court,
this
court
and
the
state
courts
can
use
to
make
that
process
a
bit
more
manageable.
certainly
one
can
look
at
the
proportion
or
the
ratio
of
in-state
production
to
nationwide
average
production
by
state
or
per
capita.
one
could
look
at
the
proportion
or
the
ratio
of
oil
production
and
its
related
industries
to
the
state's
total
economy
or
could
look
at
the
employees
who
are
involved
in
oil
production
activities
or
in
related
service
industries
as
a
proportion
of
total
work
force.
and
in
the
end,
there
may
have
to
be
some
line.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
don't,
i
don't
know
that
this
is
the
case
in
which
to
draw
the
line,
justice
scalla.
i
think
that--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--right.
wells,
in
this
case...
and
i'll
try
to
answer
that
question,
but
in
this
case
i
want
to
make
sure
that
we
start
from
the
same
foundation.
no
matter
where
you
draw
the
line,
this
case
falls
on
the
other
side
of
it,
that
is,
on
the
side
of
unconstitutionality
because
there
is
zero.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
if
we
draw
a
line.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
let
me
suggest
that
i
can't
stand
here
today
and
tell
you
what
percentage
is
the
cutoff.
i
think
that
the
court
has
always
used
and
has
drawn
comfort
from
concepts
that
are
based
in
questions
of
substantiality.
it
has
used
burdens
of
proof
and
presumptions
to
help
it
make
these
kinds
of
judgments.
but
in
the
end,
there
may
come
a
day
when
a
line
has
to
be
drawn
at
a
difficult
spot.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
the
disproportion,
the--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--whether
there
is
a
substantial
in-state
effect
that
is
reasonably
proportional
in
the
circumstances
that
would
give
the
court
confidence
that
the
in-state
economy
and
the
political
forces
within
that
state
will
be
a
check
on
the
burdensome
imposition
of
taxes.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
started
to
talk
about
some
possibilities.
you
could
use
proportional
to
the
national
average
or
the
statewide
national
average.
two
percent
of
the
average
production,
for
example,
which
would,
which
would
give
you
a
number
something
like
65
million
barrels
a
year
would
be
the
average
state
crude
oil
production.
if
you
did
it
on
a
per
capita
basis,
it
might
come
out
a
little
bit
differently.
i
think
that
there
are
ways
you
can
find
a
base
on
which
to
use
a
denominator
in
making
the
proportionality.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
these
things
may
develop,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
let
me
suggest
that
i
think
there's
a
self-regulating
mechanism
here.
to
the
extent
that
there
are
truly
substantial
in-state
effects,
they
are
less
likely
to
be,
to
arise.
the
only
states
that
have
thus
far
taken
the
position
that
windfall
profit
taxes
are
not
deductible
for
purposes
of
state
income
taxes
are
six.
five
of
them
have
no
production
at
all.
some
of
them
have
done
this
by
way
of
statutory
provisions,
some
have
done
it
by
way
of
interpretation.
one
has
negligible
production,
new
york,
which
has
something
like.03
percent
of
the
nation's
crude
oil
production.
it
may
be
that
the
issue
won't
have
to
really
come
up
because
when
you
start
moving
up
the
percentage
line,
when
you
start
getting
substantial
in-state
economic
ties
to
the
industry,
that
it
is
unlikely
that
it
will
be
viewed
as
a
target
for
this
kind
of
taxation.
now,
i
think
it's
important
to
emphasize
that
no
one
has
produced,
or
certainly
the
state
hasn't
produced,
and
we
haven't
either,
an
example
of
any
other
disallowed
deduction
that
affects
in
a
disproportionate,
geographically
disproportionate
way
the
activities
that
are
subject
to
the
disallowance.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
and
they
are.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
they
are.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
correct.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
correct.
it
is
a
theory
that
it
is
a
cost
of
production,
it
is
geographically
site-specific
in
the
sense
that
the
liability
arises
on
account
of
activities
that
occur
in
a
specific
place
at
a
specific
time,
and
it
is--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--well,
what,
severance
taxes?
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
but
it
functions
the
same
way.
it's
going
to
cost
me,
those
dollars
that
i
have
to
pay
in
severance
taxes
and
windfall
profit
taxes
i
have
to
pay
to
get
that
oil
out
of
the
ground
and
taken
off
the
premises.
it's
a
liability...
as
a
crude
oil
producer,
there
is
like
a
toll
gate
that
surrounds
the
producing
premises,
and
every
barrel
that
i
move
off
those
premises
i
have
to
pay
the
toll
right
there.
and
you
can
say
that
it's
not
like
putting
money
into
the
ground,
but
what's
the
point
of
putting
the
money
in
the
ground?
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
it
did.
the
solicitor
general
filed
a
brief
at
the
court's
invitation
at
the
jurisdictional
stage.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
read
it
as
quite
favorable.
the
solicitor
general's
position...
i'm
going
to
be
careful
not
to
overstate
it
because
the
solicitor
general
did
not
reach
a
bottom
line
conclusion
with
respect
to
the
correctness
or
incorrectness
of
the
new
jersey
supreme
court's
decision,
but
the
solicitor
general
did
set
up
a
framework
for
analysis
which
we
think
is
very
much
consistent
with
our
own
view
of
the
case,
and
he
had
no
trouble
with
what
i
think
is
the
starting
point
for
the
analysis,
which
is
whether
this
windfall
profit
tax
is
or
isn't
a
site-specific
cost
of
oil
production.
he
agreed
that
it
was.
he
didn't
think
that
was
a
hard
question.
he
thought
that
the
real
question
in
the
case,
the
dispositive
one,
was
whether
the
windfall
profit
tax
was
more
like
a
severance
tax
or
more
like
an
income
tax,
on
the
theory
that
if
it
was
more
like
an
income
tax,
there
were
similar
in-state
outlays
that
were
being
disallowed
by
the
state.
the
state
operates
this
disallowance
under
what
it
calls
its...
what
the
state
supreme
court
referred
to
as
an
add-back
provision.
like
most
states,
new
jersey
starts
with
a
federal
taxable
income
as
the
starting
point
for
computing
local
taxation,
and
then
it
makes
adjustments
up
and
down,
and
one
of
them
is
an
add-back
which
provides
that
the
taxpayers
must
add
back
taxes
paid
or
accrued
to
the
united
states
on
or
measured
by
profits
or
income.
the
issue,
statutory
issue
in
the
court
below
was
is
this
that
kind
of
case.
the
court
ultimately
held
it
was,
although
it
recognized,
and
recognized
that
the
base
on
which
the
windfall
profit
tax
is
assessed
is
quite
different
from
the
base
on
which
the
federal
income
taxes
is
assessed.
in
fact,
it
specifically
said
something
that
the
state's
brief
on
the
merits
at
least
quite
clearly
repudiates,
that
the
tax,
windfall
profit
tax
is
imposed
on
production
at
the
wellhead
and
is
based
on
values
measured
at
the
time
of
removal.
so
the
states,
the
state
court
ultimately
concluded
that
for
statutory
interpretation
purposes
this
was
a
tax
of
the
sort
described
in
that
add-back
provision.
what
is
significant,
though,
is
that
this
is
the
only
tax
affected
by
that
add-back
provision.
there's
no
reason,
there's
no
necessity
for
adding
back
federal
income
taxes
because
they're
not
deducted
in
the
first
place.
so
the
adjustment,
although
the
provision
has
been
read
for
purposes
of,
i
suppose,
comfort
by
the
tax
administrator
in
new
jersey
as
being
confirmation
that
the
federal
income
tax
is
not
in
fact
deductible
by
taxpayers
in
new
jersey,
nothing
has
to
be
done
mechanically
the
way
the
statute
is
set
up.
this
is
the
only
tax
that
is
in
fact
covered
by
the
add-back
provision
in
a
practical
way.
it
is
also
the
only
tax
in
the
category
of
taxes
on
profits
or
income
within
the
new
jersey
designation
that
is
in
fact
based
on
transaction
oriented
tax
liability
rather
than
tax
liability
incurred
on
account
of
transactions
throughout
the
country.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
for
federal
income
tax,
i
would
agree
with
you.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
think--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--what
it
did
say,
justice
scalia
is...
it
anticipated
that
states
would
permit
this
tax
to
be
deducted
for
state
tax
purposes.
that
was
an
expectation.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
it's
not
in
the
statute.
the
statute--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--well,
it's,
i'm
not...
i
think
it's
relevant.
if
you
are
looking
for
what
congress
thought
about,
the
conference
report
usually
is
some
guide
to
that,
and
the
conference
report
made
clear
that
the
windfall
profit
tax
not
only
was
going
to
be
deducted
for
purposes
of
federal
income
taxation,
but
it
expected,
the
congress
expected--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--it's
rare
to
find
those
kinds
of...
rare
to--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--well,
i
think
congress
was
operating,
justice
scalia,
on
an
assumption.
maybe
it
was
an
unwise
assumption,
but
the
assumption
was
that
states,
like
the
federal
government,
treat
excise
taxes
quite
differently
than
they
do
income
taxes.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
correct,
it
was
on
the
books
and,
as
i
say,
this
language
disallowing
federal,
federal
taxes
on
or
measured
by
profits
or
income
is
inoffensive
and
unremarkable
on
its
face
because
no
one
would
argue,
certainly
we
wouldn't
argue
that
a
state
could
not
disallow
general
federal
income
tax.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
there
certainly
have
been,
justice
kennedy,
cases
in
which
the
court
has
struck
down
interpretations
by
state
tax
administrators
of
inoffensive
on
their
face
state
tax
laws.
an
example
is
the
halliburton
case
which
is
cited
in
our
briefs
that
involved
a
use
tax
that,
as
interpreted
by
or
as
applied,
i
should
say,
by
the
tax
administrator,
worked
a
disadvantage
to
products
that
were
manufactured
out
of
the
state
rather
than
manufactured
in
the
state,
and
the
court
said--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--well,
it
was
clear,
but
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
interpretation
it
is
being
given,
whether
it
is
right
or
not
under
state
law,
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
imputed
to
the
legislature
of
new
jersey
an
intention
to
reach
this
tax
or
to
disallow
this
tax
under
that
provision.
i
don't
think
for
constitutional
purposes
that
the
rule
should
be
any
different
for
a
state
like
new
jersey
that
reaches
the
result
by
interpretation
of
administrators
or
by
courts
than
for
the
state
like
iowa
or
minnesota
that
does
it
by
virtue
of
a
specific
statutory
provision.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
think
that's,
i
think
that's
right.
certainly
you
can't,
impute
an
intent
to
a
1958
legislature
to
discriminate
against
a
tax
incurred
during...
against
those
who
incur
a
tax
enacted
later.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
think
that's,
i
think
that's...
i
wouldn't
put
it
quite
that
way.
i
think
there
may
be
situations
arise--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--i
don't
think
so
because
i
don't
think
this
happens
frequently.
this
is
the
first
time
a
case
like
this
has
ever
arisen,
and
i
can't
think
of
and
the
state
hasn't
offered
any
other
examples.
this
is
a
unique
situation.
it
was
a
pot
of
honey,
and
the
bees
started
to
be
attracted
to
it.
it
was
a
large
pot
of
$78
billion
of
federal
windfall
profit
taxes
that
were
paid
during
the
life
of
that
statute,
which,
incidentally,
i
should
mention
has
been
repealed
as
of
last
august,
and
some--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--i
know,
but
this
one
is
an
out-of-state
pot.
it
costs
nothing
in
terms
of
in-state
impact
to
disallow
that
cost.
it
raises
tax
revenues
by
enormous
amounts.
let
me
just,
just
to
give
you
a
sense
of
the
magnitude,
i
mean,
this
is
really
an
extraordinary
situation.
we
have
in
the
first
page
of
our
appendix
to
our
brief
a
fold-out
chart
that
gives
you
a
sense
of
what
the
impact
has
been
on
the
companies
involved.
there
are
two
years
at
issue
here,
1980
and
1981.
1980
was
the
phaseout
of
controls,
and
during
that,
during
that
year
there
was
still
a
substantial
amount
of
federal
price
control
in
effect;
as
a
consequence,
the
amount
of
windfall
profit
taxes
was
quite
a
bit
smaller.
but
even
during
that
year,
look
at
the
amounts,
the
percentages
by
which
new
jersey
was
able
to
increase
the
total
tax
burden
of
these
taxpayers
by
simply
denying
that
deduction.
and
then
look
at
the
next
year--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--i'm
sorry,
one,
two,
three,
the
fourth
column
over
shows
the
percentage
increase
in
the
tax
burden
on
account
of
this
disallowance.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
they
had
reported
on
their
return
10
million.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
in
the
record,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
don't
have
that
accessible.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
we
could
probably
figure
it
out.
well,
no,
i
don't
know
that
i
could
even
figure
it
out
from
the
chart
here.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
i'm
sure
it
was
billions.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
it
might
have
been
millions.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
pardon
me.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
new
jersey
for
that
year
from
amerada
hess,
if
you
just
look
across
these
columns,
the
first
column
shows
what
new
jersey's...
what
amerada
hess's
reported
tax
liability
is.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
the
second
column
shows
what
the
tax
administrator
assessed
after
denying
the
disallow...
the
deduction
for
windfall
profit
tax.
the
third
column
shows
the
difference,
that
is,
the
additional
tax
liability.
and
the
fourth
column
is
the
percentage.
does
that
answer
your
question?
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
not...
oh,
i'm
sorry,
for
1981
it
is,
yes,
almost
eight
times
as
much.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
and
i
mean,
this
is,
if
you
look
on
the
next
page...
well,
let
me
just
look
at
this
fourth
column
for
1981.
1981
was
the
year
when
the
windfall
profit
tax
really
was
at
its
height,
and
you
can
see
what
this
does
to
a
company.
for
example,
look
at,
look
at
cities
service
which
had
reported
no
net
income
at
all
for
1981
and
it
suddenly
winds
up
owing
$912,000
after
disallowance.
you
can't
even
compute
the
impact
on
there,
on
that
company
in
terms
of
percentages.
and
for
gulf
it
was
more
than
ten
times
as
much.
i
mean,
it's
not...
this
is
not...
we're
not
working
around
the
edges
here.
this
goes
right
to
the
heart
of
tax
liability.
if
you
look
at
the
next
page--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--i'm
sure
it
is.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
it's
important--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--it's
important
for
new
jersey
to
get
it,
but
it
is
important
for
new
jersey
to
get
it
in
a
balanced,
geographically
balanced
fashion
so
that
the
people
burdened
by
that,
in
effect,
that
additional
tax
burden,
are
not
exclusively
out-of-state
actors.
the
next
page
is
i
think
worth
just
looking
at
quickly
because
it
shows
what
new
jersey
would
have
had
to
do
to
its
a
allocation
factor
to
achieve
the
same
result
that
it
achieved
by
virtue
of
disallowing
the
windfall
profit
tax
deduction.
what
it
shows
that
for
amerada
hess,
it
would
have
had
to
increase
the
allocation
factor
from
23
percent,
which
is
already
pretty
substantial,
to
204
percent.
so
if
you
accept
the
premise;
that
the
deduction
of
the
windfall
profit
tax
is
a
proper
thing,
what
new
jersey
has
done
is
to
tax
amerada
hess
on
twice
of
its
total...
twice
its
total
income
nationwide.
these
are
the
kinds
of
distortions
that
occur
when
a
state
goes
after
this
huge
pot
of
out-of-state
cost
and
disallows
it.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
let
me
answer
that
this
way.
i
think
in
a
way
that
new
york
presents
that
issue
because
new
york's
level
of
production
is
really
quite,
quite
small,
and
i'm
not
prepared
to
stand
here
and
say
that
our
principle
will
not
reach
new
york.
i
thin
it
probably
does
reach
new
york.
but
i
think
one
could
draw
the
line
at
new
jersey
if
one
chose
to
do
so.
i
don't
think
it
would
really
hold
up
to
scrutiny
but
the
difference
is
that
in
new
jersey,
every
single
taxpayer
who
is
affected
by
this
disallowance
has
his
base
dramatically
skewed.
there
may
be
in
a
state
like
new
york
or
pennsylvania
or
michigan,
as
the
state
suggests,
there
may
be
substantial
enough
production
that
some
producers
are
entirely
in-state
producers,
and
as
to
them,
maybe
the
skewing
doesn't
work
that
way.
maybe
they
have
more
in-state
costs
that
are
disallowed
than
out-of-state
costs.
maybe
that's
a
basis
for
drawing
the
line
right
there.
i
don't
know.
i
don't
think
it
is,
probably,
and
i've
thought
about
that
a
great
deal,
and
i'm
not
comfortable
with
a
line
that
i
can
defend
at
that
point.
that's
why
i
think
a
better
approach
is
to
assure
oneself
that
the
impact
of
a
disallowance
does
have
some
significant
effect
on
the
in-state
economy.
if
it
has
that,
then
there's
some
protection,
some
reason
to
hope
at
least
that
the
political
forces
will
operate
in
a
way
to
make
sure
these
kinds
of
things
don't
happen
the
way
they
have
here.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
don't
think
it's
totally
irrelevant.
i
suppose
as
a
matter
of
principle
it
is,
but
it
certainly
would
make
a
difference
if
we
are
talking
about
$1000
here.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
mean,
it
might
have
the
same
principle,
but
first
of
all,
the
market
wouldn't
probably
justify
bringing
the
case
to
the
court,
but
i
think--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--that's
right,
that's
right.
if
we...
if
there
were
in-state
producers
of
a
substantial
number
so
that
the
economy
was
tied
to
it,
and
if
new
jersey
disallowed
the
production,
on
our
geographic
skewing
theory
we
would
not
be
able
to
make
our
argument,
and
there
may
be
other
arguments,
but
that
wouldn't
be...
this
wouldn't
be
one
of
them.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
then
for
sure
we
would
make
the
case.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
then
it
would
be,
then
it
would
be
facially
discriminatory.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
just
a
couple
of
things
i'd
like
to,
i'd
like
to
say.
first
of
all,
we
agree
that
the
constitution
does
not
prescribe
any
set
of
tax
deductions.
it
does
not
say
which
particular
ones
must
be
granted
or
may
be
denied.
it
may
even
be
that
a
state
could
disallow
all
deductions,
tax
gross
receipts
or
gross
income
on
some
kind
of
apportionment
mechanism,
for
purposes
of
our
argument,
although
i
should
say
that
the
solicitor
general
has
a
footnote
in
his
brief
in
which
he
expresses
some
reservation
about
whether
the
theory
of
apportionment
really
applies
to
gross
rather
than
net
income.
but
in
any
event,
the
key
there
is
that
if
that
was
what
a
state
decided
to
do,
it
would
burden
everybody
equally,
out-of-staters
and
in-staters
would
suffer
the
same
tax
consequences
and
we
would
not
have
the
kind
of
skewing
problem
that
we
have
here.
i
think
one
thing
i
did
not
mention
earlier
but
i
think
is
a
counterpoint,
justice
scalia,
to
the
concerns
that
we
discussed
earlier
about
where
to
draw
the
line,
if
you
decide
that
no
line
is
to
be
drawn,
what
it
does
is
it
opens
up
to
the
states
an
open
field.
there's
just
no
way
to
stop
a
state
once
it's
been
told
it
can
find
and
burden
purely
out-of-state
costs
from
just
spending
a
good
deal
of
their
tax
energies
looking
for
such
things
because
they
are
just
natural
targets.
now,
there
aren't
any
that
happen
right
now,
but
there
are
even
in
new
jersey
some
things
that
you
can't
find
everywhere.
there
are
casinos
in
new
jersey,
and
in
fact,
there's
a
casino
control
tax
imposed
on
casinos.
there
are
ports
in
new
jersey,
and
there's
a
federal
harbor
use
tax
that's
based
on
the
value
of
the
cargo
loaded
or
unloaded.
well,
if
new
jersey
can
do
this
to
louisiana
or
texas
producers,
louisiana
or...
texas
is
not
a
good
example,
but
louisiana
or
oklahoma
legislatures
can
just
start
disallowing
from
any
unitary
business
that
is
affected
by
ports
or
by
casinos,
the
deduction
for
those
taxes.
so
it
just
opens
up
exactly
the
kind
of
succession
of
retaliatory
measures
that
the
commerce
clause
was
designed
to
prevent.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
it
could
have
the
same
type--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--justice
scalia,
the
same
thing
could
happen
in
louisiana
and
oklahoma
that
happened
here.
you
could
look
at
a
general
disallowance,
call
it
an
add-back
or
whatever,
that
deals
with
income
taxes
or
something
similar,
or
gift
taxes.
as
one
of
our
amici
says,
you
could
call
it
a
gift
tax
for
purposes
of
statutory
interpretation;
it
makes
no
constitutional
difference.
but
the
administrator
could
simply
construe
income
taxes
to
embrace
value-based
excise
taxes,
which
is
essentially
what
new
jersey
has
done
here.
i'd
like
to
just
get
back
to
one
of
the...
what
i
think
is
ultimately
one
of
the
key
questions
here,
which
is
whether
this
is
or
isn't
like
a
severance
tax.
well,
this
court
has
done
some
work
on
severance
taxes.
in
commonwealth
edison
it
discussed
a
coal
severance
tax
in
montana,
and
the
guidance
from
that
decision
is
that
there
are
two
things
to
look
at.
you
look
at
the
operating
incidence
of
the
tax...
in
this
case
it's
the
removal
of
each
barrel
of
crude
oil...
and
you
look
at
the
measure...
in
this
case
it's
wellhead
values...
identical
in
significant,
in
all
significant
respects
to
the
kind
of
tax
that
was
at
issue
in
commonwealth
edison.
and
what
the
court
found
there
was
that
only
montana
could
tax
that
event
and
that
measure
because
it
is
purely
site-specific
to
montana.
and
i
think
the
same
principle
applies
here.
