unknown
speaker
the
new
jersey
allow
the
appellants
to
deduct
their
federal
income
tax?
unknown
speaker
do
you
claim
that
is
a
violation
of
any
constitutional
principle?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
too,
mr.
evans?
unknown
speaker
before
you
get...
what
is
the
allocation
factor
that
new
jersey
applies
after
they
use
their
three
factor
formula
to
your
company?
unknown
speaker
well,
roughly
what
is
the
factor?
unknown
speaker
well,
taking
chevron,
for
example,
it
is
a
little
over
4
percent.
unknown
speaker
now
would
you
tell
me,
supporting
chevron
had
4
percent
of
its
producing
wells
in
new
jersey,
would
they
have...
would
you
be
able
to
make
the
claim
you're
making
here?
unknown
speaker
would
you
have
any
constitutional
objection
to
this
scheme
if
that
were
the
fact?
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
based
entirely
on
the
geographic
factor.
unknown
speaker
but
if
they
did
have
4
percent
of
their
wells
in
new
jersey,
you'd
still
have
the
same
rather
dramatic
distortion
by
this
bank
by
not
allowing
this
particular
deduction.
unknown
speaker
it
wouldn't
be
quite
as
dramatic.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
4
percent
would
be
a
substantial,
substantial
enough
impact?
i'm
not
sure
that's
fair.
what
about.001
percent?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
we
would
have
to
draw
some
line,
wouldn't
we?
we'd
have
to
figure
out
what
percent
is
substantial
enough
for
new
jersey
for
this
particular
exclusions,
and
there
are
all
sorts
of
other
exclusions.
we
will
have
to
figure
out
some
percentage
of
substantial
enough
in-state
impact.
unknown
speaker
and
what...
you
mean
if
the
proportion
in
new
jersey
is
not
the
same
as
the...
it
has
to
match
what?
it
has
to
be
one-fiftieth,
or
it
has
to
be
one
what?
unknown
speaker
i
want
to
know
what
kind
of
a
line
you're
asking
me
to
draw.
that's
what
i
want
to
know
before
i
even
decide
that
i
want
to
draw
a
line.
unknown
speaker
if
you
draw
a
line.
unknown
speaker
right,
but
whether
i
draw
a
line
depends
on,
to
some
extent,
on
whether
i
can
draw
a
line.
now,
you
tell
me
what
a
line
would
look
like.
unknown
speaker
but
a
judgment
of
what?
i
don't
even
know
what
you're
asking
me
to
judge.
what
is
the
criteria?
what
am
i
looking
for?
unknown
speaker
but
some
disproportion--
unknown
speaker
--proportional
to
what?
you
say
proportional,
sufficiently
proportional.
proportional
to
what?
unknown
speaker
it's
not
just
this
court
that's
going
to
be
handling
this
sort
of
a
doctrine;
it's
court
all
over
the
country.
unknown
speaker
and
it
sounds
like
they're
going
to
be
casting
about
pretty
much.
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
submission
that
the
severance
taxes
from
other,
imposed
by
other
states
should
be
deducted
from
gross
income
by
new
jersey?
unknown
speaker
and
are
they,
all
the
time?
unknown
speaker
and
is
that
theory
that
it
is
a
cost
of
production?
unknown
speaker
just
like
the
windfall
profits
tax
is?
unknown
speaker
but
it
isn't
the
kind
of
a
cost
that's
associated
with
producing
the
gas
out
of
the
ground,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
just
a
tax,
it's
just
a
tax,
but
it
isn't
how
much
does
it
cost
me
to
drill
down
to
20,000
feet?
unknown
speaker
what
did
the...
did
the
united
states
file
some
amicus
brief
here?
unknown
speaker
and
what...
how
do
you
read
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
evans,
if
i
sat
down
and
wanted
to
draw
up
a
list
of
those
disallowed
deductions
that
we
wouldn't
have
to
worry
about
for
purposes
of
policing
commerce
clause
activity,
i
really
think
number
one
on
that
list
would
be
disallowance
of
federal
income
taxes,
for
the
simple
reason
that
if
the
federal
government
doesn't
think
that
that
should
be
disallowed,
it
could
say
so
when
it
imposes
the
tax,
if
it
really
thinks
that
that's
what
the
commerce
clause
requires.
isn't
this
the
least
worrisome
of
them
that
we
would
have
to
worry
about?
unknown
speaker
well,
any
federal
tax,
federal
income
or
other
tax.
unknown
speaker
all
the
federal
government
had
to
do
was
to
say
when
it
imposed
this
tax
it
shall
not
be...
it
shall
be
deducted
from
income
for
purposes
of
any
state
income
tax.
unknown
speaker
that's
in
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
it's
in
the
legislative
history,
which
is
just
as
good.
unknown
speaker
it
could
have
said
that
in
the
statute,
though,
very
easily.
unknown
speaker
a
lot
of
our
other
problems
we
wouldn't
be
able
to
say
that.
a
lot
of
our
other
ones
we'd
have
to
say,
gee,
if
we
didn't
police
it,
you
know,
the
congress
wouldn't
get
to
it,
why
would
it
ever
come
to
congress's
attention.
this
can
come
to
congress's
attention
every
time
it
passes
a
tax.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
new
jersey
statute
was
on
the
books
when
the
excess
profits
tax
was
passed,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
have
authority
which
requires
us
to
invalidate
state
laws
even
though
they
were
valid
when
enacted
because
the
economy
changes
and
the
law
is
then
seen
to...
is
viewed
as
discriminatory
in
effect?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i
would
suggest
that
here
the
new
jersey
statute
was
clear
at
all
times.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
certainly
writes
out
of
the
equation
any
intent
to
discriminate.
unknown
speaker
so
under
your
theory,
all
states
have
the
obligation
to
constantly
revise
their
state
tax
laws
in
order
to
take
account
of
new
economic
conditions?
unknown
speaker
but
that's
the
principle
you're
arguing
for,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
tax
authorities
find
a
universe
of
honey
that
they
are
attracted
to.
unknown
speaker
that's
which
column,
the
second
from
the
right?
unknown
speaker
and
for
amerada
it's
15
percent.
unknown
speaker
and
they
actually
paid
new
jersey
what
that
year,
12
million?
unknown
speaker
what
was
amerada's
gross
income
in
that
year?
unknown
speaker
can
you
give
me
an
order
of
magnitude?
unknown
speaker
well,
was
it
billions
or--
unknown
speaker
--new
jersey--
unknown
speaker
--in
terms
of
money,
new
jersey--
unknown
speaker
--new
jersey
collected
how
much
more
money
from--
unknown
speaker
--right.
unknown
speaker
seven
times
as
much
tax,
seven
times
as
much
tax.
unknown
speaker
yes,
exactly.
unknown
speaker
it
is
very
important
for
new
jersey
to
get
that
money,
i
would
guess.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
it's
important
on
both
sides.
unknown
speaker
so
long
as
it
legitimately
can,
right?
unknown
speaker
may
i
interrupt
with
another
question?
if...
we've
already
talked
about
the
possibility
that
they
had
the
same
percentage
of
their
wells
in
the
state
that
the
allocation
factor...
supposing
they
just
had
one
well,
so
it
was
a
trivial
amount?
how...
this
is
kind
of
the
line
drawing
problem
that
justice
scalia
asked
about,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
but
what
is
your
position?
does
your
claim
just
apply
to
factors
that
are
totally
outside
the
state
or
whenever
there's
a
substantial
distortion?
unknown
speaker
one
of
the
troublesome
things
about
the
case
is
just
the
fact
that
they
disallowed
this
cost
is
itself,
it
seems
somewhat
unfair
because
it
is
such
a
large
item,
but
that
we
can't
really...
that
really
is
constitutionally
irrelevant,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
you
say
they
could
still
do
this,
as
outrageous
as
it
seems,
so
long
as
they
did
it
to
in-state
companies.
unknown
speaker
xxx...
add
back
from
out-of-staters.
unknown
speaker
so
that's--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
well,
that's
really
what
you're
saying
here.
it's
the
same
kind
of
an
argument.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
evans.
mrs.
hamill,
we
will
hear
now
from
you.
unknown
speaker
may
i
interrupt
with
a
question,
ms.
hamill?
unknown
speaker
supposing
that
the
federal
government
recast
this
tax
a
little
bit,
a
little
different,
and
made
it
definitely
a
severance
tax
so
that
it
unquestionably
and
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
was
a
severance
tax?
or
perhaps
i
should
ask
the
question,
do
you
think
new
jersey
could
constitutionally
treat
severance
taxes
imposed
by
states
in
the
same
way
it
has
treated
this
tax?
unknown
speaker
no,
my
question
really
is
if...
there
are
really
two
parts
to
it.
one,
is
there
a
constitutional
objection
to
treating
severance
taxes
the
way
new
jersey
treats
this
tax,
and
if
so,
could
you
overcome
the
objection
by
just
calling
it
an
income
tax?
because
arguably,
what
you
have...
what
we
have
before
us
is
something
that
at
least
the
solicitor
general
suggests
could
be
treated
as
a
site-specific
tax
and
therefore
comparable
to
a
severance
tax,
even
though
in
construing
your
statute
your
court
has
called
it
an
income
tax.
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
an
argument
the
other
way,
i
suppose,
on
that.
i
think
it's
just
the
reverse.
if
you
had
a
severance
tax,
it
wouldn't
be
a
problem
because
then
you'd
be
affecting
yourself,
you'd
be
denying
deductions
to
people
in
your
state
as
well
as
deductions
to
people
elsewhere.
it
precisely
becomes
a
problem
when
you
do
not
allow
a
deduction
for
severance
tax
which
is
cost
free
to
you
because
you
don't
have
any
severance
taxes.
unknown
speaker
you
may
be
keeping
it
out.
unknown
speaker
or
you
may
be
keeping
it
out.
well,
is
that--
--do
you
suppose,
could
new
jersey
say
to
these
oil,
the
oil
company,
we
are
not
going
to
allow
you
to
deduct
from
gross
income
any
of
your
labor
costs
associated
with
producing
oil?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
just
said
in
connection
with
producing
of
oil.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
wouldn't
be
anybody
in
new
jersey
who
would
be
denied
the
deduction
because
there's
no
oil
produced
in
new
jersey.
unknown
speaker
well,
all
i'm
talking
about
are...
if
we
define
labor
any
way
you
want
to,
it's
the
kind
of
labor
that
is
spent
at
the
point
of...
labor
costs
at
the
point
of
producing
the
oil
and
gas.
could
you
deny
that
deduction?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
well
i--
unknown
speaker
--well,
if
you
call
a
windfall
profit
tax
a
cost
of
production
like
you
do
severance
taxes,
you
would
have
the
same
objection
because
you,
certainly
you
allow
your
own
citizens
all
the
costs
that
they
incur
in
the
production
of
income.
unknown
speaker
ms.
hamill,
is
there
any
reason
why
the...
why
new
jersey
or
any
other
state
could
not
impose
a
gross
income
tax,
duly
apportioned,
on
a
company
like
amerada
or
one
of
the
other
oil
companies,
allowing
no
deductions
for
anything?
really,
it
would
be
in
effect
a
form
of
sales
tax,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
ms.
hamill,
what
about
a
gross,
gross
receipts
tax
on
nationwide
receipts,
apportioned,
that
is,
not
just
on
sales
in
new
jersey,
but
the
state
uses
the
theory
that
some
difficult-to-ascertain
proportion
of
all
the
money
this
company
makes
nationwide
is
attributable
to
its
new
jersey
activities
on
the
basis
of
salary
or
whatever,
uses
some
formula,
and
it
applies
that
formula
to
nationwide
gross
receipts,
and
the
tax
is
on
nationwide
gross
receipts.
would
that
be
constitutional?
unknown
speaker
in
one
of
your
earlier
answers
you
indicated
that
the
sole
or
controlling
rationale
for
our
cases
requiring
apportionment
is
so
that
a
state
does
not
try
to
encourage
industry
to
move
to
new
jersey,
and
of
course,
that
fits
very
well
here
because
there's
no
oil
in
new
jersey,
but
is
that
the
sole
rationale
of
those
cases?
don't
they
go
beyond
that
and
say
that
a
state
simply
may
not
reach
beyond
its
borders
and
tax
a
transaction
that
doesn't
occur
there?
unknown
speaker
it's
a
jurisdictional
concept,
almost,
although
it's
within
the
interstate
commerce
clause.
unknown
speaker
xxx
figured
at
the
wellhead,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
if
one
of
the
changed
circumstances
had
been
a
congressional
statute
saying
you
can't
impose
any
tax
on
this
oil,
it
would
have
been
unconstitutional
to
apply
it
to
it.
unknown
speaker
and
that
would
have
been
a
subsequent
event.
unknown
speaker
or
if
iowa
had
started
to
tax,
interpreted
its
law
in
a
way
that
suddenly
taxed
out-of-state
transactions
at
double
the
rate
that
local
transactions,
i
suppose
it
would
be
invalid
even
though
it
was
an
old
law.
unknown
speaker
and
here's
we've
got
a
brand
new
interpretation
of
this
statute
because
this
problem
just
hadn't
arisen.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
i
don't
think
the
fact
it
was
constitutional
when
it
was
passed
makes
it
immune
from
constitutional
attack
forever.
unknown
speaker
i
presume
texas
does
not
deny
the
deduction.
unknown
speaker
better
still,
right.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
question
before
you
sit
down?
in
the
appendix
to
their
brief
they
have
a
table...
it's
appendix
b
that
was
called
to
my
attention
earlier...
which
compares
the
actual
allocation
factor
with
the
effective
allocation
factor
and
shows
the
percentage
increase
by
reason
of
the
denial
of
this
deduction.
i
am
never
sure
whether
these
things
are
in
the
record
or
just
prepared
in
the
briefs.
do
you
disagree
at
all
with
the
figures
there,
or
just--
unknown
speaker
--okay.
i
just
wanted
to
be
sure.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
they
made
a
lot
of
money
during
the
windfall
profits
years.
unknown
speaker
that's
not
surprising.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
hamill.
mr.
evans,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
maybe
if
they
had
a
general
tax,
a
general
disallowance
of
deduction
that
happened
to
embrace
casino
taxes
it
would
be
okay.
unknown
speaker
if
they
enacted
a
special
tax
that
says
we
are
going
to
disallow
casino
taxes,
that
might
be
a
different
question.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
10:00.
