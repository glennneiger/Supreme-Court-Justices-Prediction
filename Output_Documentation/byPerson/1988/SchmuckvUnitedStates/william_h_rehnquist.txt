william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
87-6431,
wayne
t.
schmuck
v.
united
states.
mr....
it's
steinberg?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
steinberg.
mr.
steinberg,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
judge
crabb
let
the
case
go
to
the
jury
and
then
granted
judgment
of
acquittal
after
they
returned
their
verdict.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but...
but
if
there
had
been
no
mailing
in
any
given
case
in
which
your
client
participated,
he
would
have
had
problems
in
the
future,
wouldn't
he?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
because
there's
no
fraud.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
odometer
fraud
wasn't
an
end
in
itself.
the
odometer
fraud
was
an
end...
was
a...
was
a
design
by
which
cars
would
be
sold
for
a
higher
price.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
transfer
of
title
is
incident
to
the
sale
of
cars.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
maze
really
just
took
a
winter
vacation.
i
mean,
he...
he
was
gone
and
defrauded
several
motel
owners.
then
he
came
back
home,
and
that
was
the
end
of
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
it?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
know
why
he
went
south
then.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
steinberg.
mr.
martin,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
these
were
cars
brought
in
from
another
state?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
would
really
broaden
the
mail
fraud
statute
if
every
document
mailed
had
a
lulling
effect
because
it
didn't
mention
the
fraud.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
was
not
charged
with
odometer
tampering
in
the
indictment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where...
where
in
your
brief
is
the
language
of
31(c)?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
is
it
in
the
petitioner's
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
page
19
is...
is
the
language?
whose
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
didn't
feel
it
necessary
to
set
it
forth
in
your
brief.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr....
mr.
martin...
your
first
name
brian.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you...
if
you
adopt
a
test
based
on...
on
an
indictment,
i
take
it
you
still
wouldn't
give
an
instruction
unless
there
were
evidence
of
the
lesser
included
offense,
enough
evidence
to
support
a
verdict
to
that
effect.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
martin.
mr.
steinberg,
you
have
10
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
presumably
nobody
likes
mail
fraud
either.
[laughter]
i
mean,
odometer
tampering
is
a...
is
a
misdemeanor.
mail
fraud
is
a
felony,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
steinberg.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
87-6431,
schmuck
versus
united
states
will
be
announced
by
justice
blackmun.
