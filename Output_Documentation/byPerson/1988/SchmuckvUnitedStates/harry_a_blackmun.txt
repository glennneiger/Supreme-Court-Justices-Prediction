justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
this
is
a
male
fraud
case
presenting
two
issues.
petitioner,
schmuck,
is
a
wisconsin
used
car
distributor.
the
indictment
alleged
that
he
purchased
used
cars
and
rolled
back
their
odometers,
and
sold
the
cars
to
retail
dealers
at
prices
that
were
inflated
by
the
low
milage
readings,
and
that
the
dealers
relying
on
these
readings
then
resold
the
cars
to
customers
at
inflated
prices.
the
transactions
were
consummated
by
the
dealers’
mailing
title
application
forms
to
the
state
on
behalf
of
their
customers.
schmuck
moved
to
dismiss
the
indictment
on
the
ground
that
these
mailings
were
not
in
for
furtherance
of
the
fraudulent
scheme,
and
he
also
moved
for
what
is
called
a
lessor
included
offense
jury
instruction
on
the
crime
of
tampering
with
an
odometer.
both
motions
were
denied
and
the
jury
returned
guilty
verdicts,
and
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed.
we
affirm
that
judgment.
we
hold
that
the
mailings
at
issue
satisfy
the
mailing
element
of
the
federal
crime
of
mail
fraud
that
mailings
were
necessary
for
the
successful
passage
of
title
to
the
cars
and
the
failure
of
the
passage
of
title
would
have
jeopardized
the
petitioner’s
relationship
of
trust
with
his
dealers.
we
also
hold
that
for
purposes
of
the
lessor
included
offense
instruction,
the
so-called
elements
test
is
to
be
utilized.
we
reject
the
inherent
relationship
approach
that
has
been
adapted
by
some
courts
of
appeals.
and
the
result
in
this
case,
is
that
petitioner,
schmuck,
was
not
entitled
to
a
lessor
included
offense
instruction.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
adjoined
therein
by
justice
brennan
and
justice
marshall
and
justice
o’connor.
