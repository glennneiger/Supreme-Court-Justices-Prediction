how
long
a
period
of
time
did
this
odometer
scheme
go
on
as
established
in
the
indictment
and
as
established
at
trial?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we'll,
isn't
the
government
going
to
tell
us
in
its
part
of
the
argument
that
the
mails
were
really
necessary
for
the
scheme
to
continue
this
long?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
a
mail
fraud
can
be
a
long-term
scheme
involving
multiple
acts,
can
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
there
any
evidence
that
the
sale
of
the
cars
was
facilitated
by
the
lower
mileage?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
isn't
that
part
of
the
scheme?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i...
i
take
it
that
if
the
dealer
had
mailed
your
client
the
money
in
the
mail
for
each
car,
there
would
have
been
a
fraud?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
we
can't
get
any
more--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--raw
than
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
you
say
that
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
turning
the
odometer
back,
we
get
back
to
the
same
question.
well,
of
course,
the
odometer
turn-back
facilitated
the
sales.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
the
evidence
show
that
they
relied...
that
they
purchased
for
him
because
they'd
purchased
from
him
on
past
occasions?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
they
say
specifically
that
they
relied
upon
him
because
of
past
transactions,
or
do
we
just
infer
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
excuse
me.
i
just
want
to
be
clear
on
that.
your
position
is...
is
that
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
the
lesser
included
offense
instruction
if
he
asks
for
it
in
the
berra
type
of...
in
the
case
that
berra
had
in
mind,
that
is
to
say
where
the
lesser
offense
is
necessarily
included
in
the
greater.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if...
if...
if
the...
if...
if
the
evidence
is...
is
very
strong
on
all
of
the
elements
of
the
greater
offense?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
i
thought
the
evidence
was
always
contested
because
the
government
has
the
burden
of
proof.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you're
not
entitled
to
the
instruction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
logic
of
that.
