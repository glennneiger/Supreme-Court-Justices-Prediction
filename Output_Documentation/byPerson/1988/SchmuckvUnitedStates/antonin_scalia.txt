justice
antonin
scalia
why
didn't
they
lull
anybody?
they...
they
lulled
the...
the...
the
car
dealer
into...
into
believing
that
the
titles
your
client
had
provided
him
were
good
in
the
past
instances,
and
therefore
he
could
rely
on
good
title
in
future
instances.
wasn't
that
a
lull?
justice
antonin
scalia
wasn't
passing
good
title
to
the
car
an
essential
part
of
his
scheme?
didn't
he
have
to...
he
had
to
sell
a
car,
and
in
order
to
sell
the
later
cars,
he
had
to
persuade
the
car
dealer
that
he
had
passed
good
title
to
the
earlier
ones.
and
the
mailing
was
essential
to
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
if...
if
your
point
is
that
the...
that
the
fraud,
the
misstatement
of
fact,
has
to
be
contained
in
the
document
that's
mailed...
is
that
the
point
because
that
can't
be
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
your
client
had
mailed
the
automobile
title
to
the
used
car
dealer
instead
of
handing
it
to
him.
he
had
given
him...
instead
of
giving
him
the
title
documents,
he
had
mailed
the
title
documents.
would
that
have
been
enough
to...
to
bring
this
scheme
within
the
mail
fraud
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
but
you're
now
confirming
what
you
before
denied.
you
said
it
isn't
essential
that
the
actual
fraud...
fraudulent
element
be
put
in
the
mail.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
i
read
the
statute
that
way.
it's
just
the
mail
has
to
be
part...
the
use
of
the
mail
has
to
be
part
of
the
whole
scheme.
now
you're
telling
me
that
the
use
of
the
mail
has
to
contain
the...
the
essential
element
of
the
fraud.
justice
antonin
scalia
only
if
he
sells
the
car.
i
mean,
i
don't
think
it's
a
criminal
violation
to
tamper
with
an
odometer
if
it's
in
your
own
car
and
you
never
try
to
sell
the
car.
right?
the
offense
is
selling
a
car
with...
with
an
altered
odometer.
isn't
that...
or
am
i
liable
if
i
just...
you
know,
i
like
to
play
with
odometers.
[laughter]
is
that
a
federal
offense?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
you
think
it
would
be
an
offense
even
if
i
didn't
sell
the
car.
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
think
you're
right
that...
that
the
offense
here
is...
is
not
odometer
tampering.
i
think
if
you
tamper
with
an
odometer,
that's
an
offense.
the
indictment
here
was
for
mail
fraud.
fraud
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
odometer
tampering.
it
has
to
do
with
selling
a
car
that
purports
to
be
one
thing
and
is
in
fact
something
else.
but
an
essential
part
of
the
fraud
is
getting
money
by
false
pretenses.
here
the
false
pretense
was
purporting
to
transfer
title
of
something
that
was
different
from
what
you
were
actually
conveying.
right?
and...
and
the
transfer
is
part...
is
an
essential
part
of
that
scheme,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
i
never
sell
the
car,
that's
a
fraud?
it's
odometer
tampering.
it's
certainly
not
fraud.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
you
say
the
scope,
he's
not
challenging
the
scope,
you
mean
he's
not
raising
the
point
that
justice
o'connor
was
raising?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
i
have
trouble
with
that
point
too.
i
think
it's
very
difficult--
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay,
but...
but
nonetheless,
if...
if
that
is
your
theory
then,
you
have
to
show
that
the
use
of
the
mails
was
necessary
to
sell
it
to
the
customers,
not
to
the
dealer.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
which
is
probably
easier
i
guess.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
you
quote
is
the
phrase
"necessarily
included".
justice
antonin
scalia
but
in
our
system,
that's
up
for...
up
to
the
prosecutor.
if...
if
he
wants
to
go
for
a
lesser
offense,
he
goes...
he...
he
could
have
charged
for
that,
but
he
chose
not
to.
and
that's
the
kind
of
system
we
have.
it's...
it's
not
up
to
the...
to
the
court
to
decide
what...
what
the
individual
will
be
prosecuted
for.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
a
very
limited
area.
your...
your...
your
theory
would...
would
extend
that
overruling
much
more
broadly.
justice
antonin
scalia
--your...
your
mailing
argument
that...
that...
you
think
it's
important
that
the
mailing
wouldn't
have
helped...
wouldn't
have
helped
your
client's
scheme,
that
if
anything,
it
would
have...
it
would
have
hurt
it.
that
depends
on
how
you
read
the
statute,
doesn't
it?
the
statute
says
for
the
purpose
of
executing
such
scheme
knowingly
causes
to
be
delivered
to
be
delivered
by
mail.
it
depends
on
what
the
phrase
"for
the
purpose
of
executing
such
scheme.
"
goes
to.
does
it
mean
for
the
purpose
of
executing
such
scheme
causes
or
does
it
mean
for
the
purpose
of
executing
such
scheme
delivered?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
delivered
for
the
purpose
of
executing
the
scheme,
or
is
it
is
causes
for
the
purpose
of
executing
the
scheme?
he...
he
doubtless
caused
this
to
be
delivered
for
the
purpose
of
executing
the...
he
didn't
cause
it
to
be
delivered
for
the
purpose
of
executing
the
scheme,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
the
purpose
of
executing
the
scheme,
he
caused
it
to
be
delivered.
isn't
that...
isn't
that--
