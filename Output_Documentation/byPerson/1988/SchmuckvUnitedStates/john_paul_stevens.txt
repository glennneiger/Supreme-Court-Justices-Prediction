justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
mr.
steinberg?
supposing
that
the
automobile
dealers,
instead
of
mailing
the
documents
to
the
secretary
of
state,
had
thrown
them
in
the
waste
basket
and
no
mailings
had
occurred,
would
your
scheme
have
been
successful?
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
how
long?
justice
john
paul
stevens
once
it
would
have,
but
for
two
years
could
he
have
kept
going
if
they
kept
every
time--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
don't
really
think
there
are
any
dealers
who
are
that
dumb,
do
you?
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
isn't
it
equally
obvious
that
the
scheme
could
not
have
persisted
for
two
years
had
there
been
no
mailings?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
depended
on
repeated
sales
of
automobiles.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
really
isn't
quite
the
same...
that
is
not
what
is
alleged
in
the
indictment.
it's
not
a
single
odometer
tampering
followed
by
a
sale.
it's
a
scheme
that
persisted
for
several
purchases,
several
resales
and
so
forth.
and
so,
every
person
who
does
one
doesn't
at
least
fit
within
this
indictment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
only
case
i
guess
we
have
that
deals
with
this
is
the
keeble
case
in
which
the
lesser
included
offense
was
one
which
was
not
prohibited
by
federal
law.
so,
how
could
the
statutory
elements
of
the
lesser
included
offense
have
been
part
of
the
greater
included
offense
in
that
case?
you
recall
the
case
[inaudible].
there
was
no--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
there
was
no
federal
definition
of
the
federal
crime
of
simple
assault
which
the
lesser
included
offense,
as
i
remember
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it...
is
it
any
simpler
to
apply
than
the...
than
just
looking
at
the
indictment?
in
this
case
i
guess
the
indictment
clearly
alleged
odometer
tampering
as
well
as
mail
fraud.
at
least
as
i
read
it,
it
seems
to
allege
all
the
elements
of
odometer
tampering.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it's
certainly
clear
that
it
was
done--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--intentionally.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
just
wondering
because
your
argument
of...
i
mean
easily
applied
certainly
has
some
appeal
to
it.
but
is
it
really
any
easier
to
apply
than...
it
would
be
more
difficult
here
to
look
at
the
evidence.
but
when
you
have
the
indictment
that
at
least
arguably
spells
out
all
the
elements
of
the
lesser
offense--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--why
is
that
any
harder
to
apply?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
martin,
may
i
ask
one
other
question.
if...
if...
what
we're
concerned
with
here
is
when
the
judge
must
give
the
instruction,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
take
it
that
if
a
judge
felt
that
in
a
case
like
this...
say,
judge
crabb
had
thought
that,
well,
maybe
i
only
have
to
give
it
when
it's
with
the
same
statutory
elements.
it
would
not
have
been
error
for
her
to
have
gone
ahead
and
given
the
instruction
at
the
defendant's
request,
would
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
think
that
the...
that
she
may
only
give
it
where...
where
she
must
give
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
of
course,
the
evidence
has
to
support
it.
i
agree
to
that
no
matter
what
test
she
used.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can't
you
say
that
to
any
criminal
activity?
the
more
often
you
do
it,
the
more
chance
there
is
you'll
get
caught.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
about--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--let
me
ask
about
the
instruction
you
say
you
are
entitled
to
here.
should
judge
crabb
have
said
you
may
convict
him
of
20
different
counts
of...
i
don't
know
how
many
times
he
did
it,
but
it
was
a
large
number,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
he
have
been
subject
to
conviction
for
12
counts
of
odometer
tampering
or
just
1
under
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
that
what
she
should
have
instructed?
