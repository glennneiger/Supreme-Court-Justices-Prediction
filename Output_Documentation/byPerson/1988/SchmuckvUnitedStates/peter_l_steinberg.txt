mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
steinberg.
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
have
about
a
dozen
points
to
make
here.
the
first
is
that
title
registration
is
required
by
law
just
as
in
the
case
of
parr,
payment
of
taxes
was
required
by
law.
and
in
each
case,
the
use
of
the
mails
was
convenient
but
not
compulsory.
i
think
that's
a
significant
parallel
to
the
parr
case.
second,
even
in
the
decision
of
galloway,
the
seventh
circuit
case
initially
establishing
that
odometer
tampering
could
become
mail
fraud
under
these
circumstances,
the
court
recognized
that
it
was
stretching
the
limits
of
the
mail
fraud
statute.
judge
crabb,
the
trial
court
in
this
case
as
in
galloway,
didn't
in
galloway
accept
the
proposition.
she
granted
a
directed
verdict,
and
the
seventh
circuit
reversed.
judge
swygert
dissented
from
that
in
the
galloway
case
and
judge
cudahy,
who
concurred
in
the
judgments,
said
that
it
was
taking
the
mail
fraud
statute
to
its
outer
limits,
but
he
accepted
the
extension
because
of
the
judicially
hypertrophied
reach
of
the
statute.
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
yes,
in
the
galloway
case.
and
then
in
the
present
case,
in
the
panel
decision
in
which
judge
swygert
participated,
although
he
rejected
our
argument
that
this
wasn't
a
proper
mail
i
fraud
case,
he
did
indicate
that
it
was
the
history
of
judicial
expansion
of
the
statute
which
he
felt
controlled
the
case.
now,
i
think
in
the
mcnally
case,
this
court
established,
according
to
the
general
principles
of
interpretation
of
criminal
statutes,
that
where
you're
faced
with
two
possible
interpretations,
you
should
choose
the
less
harsh
one
and
also
that
you
shouldn't
create
constructive
crimes...
constructive
offenses.
and
in
mcnally
itself,
the
trial
court
had
dismissed
mail
fraud
charges
based
on
the
mailing
of
tax
returns
which
were,
once
again,
compulsory
although...
and
the
ruling
in
parr
was
applied
by
the
trial
court
in
mcnally.
the
odometer
tampering
statute,
which
is
on
the
books,
covers
my
client's
conduct
precisely.
and
in
the
case
of
maze
where
after
the
offense
in
maze,
which
was
credit
card
fraud,
had
occurred,
congress
subsequently
passed
a
law
establishing
credit
card
fraud
as
a
separate
offense.
in
footnote
9,
the
court
in
maze
noted
that
there
may
or
may
not
have
been
some
significance
in
that
and
didn't
actually
decide
whether
the
existence
of
a
specific
federal
statute
covering
the
specific
conduct
meant
that
the
mail
fraud
statute
should
or
shouldn't
also
apply.
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
about
two
years,
your
honor.
my
client
had
been--
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
--well,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
in
a
single
instance
the
mailing
of
the
title
documents
doesn't
suffice
to
make
it
mail
fraud,
the
multiplication
of
the
instances
doesn't
change
anything.
i
simply
feel
that
the
repetition
of
odometer
tampering
doesn't
create
a
mail
fraud.
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
well,
justice
kennedy,
the
core
prohibition
of
the
mail
fraud
statute,
as
i
think
was
well-analyzed
in
mcnally,
is
to
prohibit
mailings
which
somehow
alter
the
situation
to
the
benefit
of
the
person
committing
the
fraud.
and
these
odometer...
these
title
registrations
didn't
in
any
way
induce
reliance
or
forbearance.
they
didn't
lull
anybody.
as...
as
i
indicated
in
my
reply
brief--
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
--justice
scalia,
my
client
gave
good
title
to
those
cars.
that's
correct.
it...
the...
the
success
of
the
title
registration
indicated
that
my
client
had
passed
good
title.
it
said
nothing
at
all
one
way
or
the
other
about
whether
he
had
rolled
back
the
odometers.
and
that's
been
the
point
i
think
at
which
the
government's
case
breaks
down.
there's
nothing
about
title
registration
which
reassures
you
the
odometer
hasn't
been
tampered
with.
it's
simply
title
registration
is
a
method
of
preserving
a
record
of
who
owned
the
car
so
that
in
the
event
there
is
an
investigation,
you
can
track
down
what
happened.
now,
it's
true--
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
--well,
the
reason
that
there
had
to
be
a
title
registration
mailed
was
because
the
state
has
set
up
a
scheme
for
title
registration
in
order
to
preserve
a
record.
my
client
had
to
pass
good
title
to
the
cars,
but
the
only
reason
the
title
had
to
be
registered
was
because
of
a
state
requirement
which
was
clearly
related
to
assist
in
the
investigation
of
this
kind
of
conduct
when
an
investigation
is
appropriate.
and
i
think
it's
significant--
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
--but
how
could
the
fact
that
he
had
tampered
with
the
odometers
possibly
affect
whether
the
title
registered
or
not.
that's
the
point
i'm
making.
the
title
was
going
to
be
registered.
he
was
giving
good
title
whether
or
not
he
rolled
back
the
odometers.
there's
no
way
that
his
rolling
back
the
odometers
would
have
hurt
the
title
registration
process.
and
as
i
indicated--
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
--the
cars
were
sold
for
a
higher
price
because
of
the
lower
mileage.
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
cars
would
not
otherwise
have
been
sold
for
a
lower
price.
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
it's
part
of
the
scheme
to
sell
the
cars
for
more
money,
yes.
but
as
i
seem
to
be
repeating,
there's
simply
no
connection
between
registering
the
change
in
ownership
and
detecting
this
odometer
tampering.
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
no.
we
really
don't
take
the
position
that
the
inclusion
or
the
exclusion
of
the
odometer
mileage
statements
makes
any
difference.
our
position
is
that
you
have
to
analyze
the
core
prohibition
of
the
statute
and
the
facts
of
the
case
to
see
how
the
mailing
contributed
to
lulling
somebody,
to
obtaining
something
that
otherwise
would
not
have
been
obtained
if
the
fraud
had
not
taken
place.
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
i
don't
think
so,
justice
scalia,
because
i
don't
think
that
the
provision
of
good
title
was
at
all
affected
by
the
fraudulent
odometer.
the...
the
title
was
good.
the
odometer
tampering
scheme
depended
upon
the
false
odometer
slips
which
my
client
hand-delivered.
if
he
had
mailed
those
false
odometer
slips,
then
i
would
agree
there
was
a
mail
fraud
case
involved.
in
fact,
he
used
the
telephone
a
couple
of
times--
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
--no.
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
no,
justice
scalia.
the
point
i'm
making,
which
i
think
is
made
in
parr
and
in
maze
and,
for
that
matter,
in
sampson,
is
you
have
to
be
able
to
point
out
how
the
mailing
contributed
to
the
success
of
the
scheme,
how
it
lulled
somebody,
how
it
permitted
somebody
to
make
a
promise
or
as
in
the
carpenter
case,
how
unless...
in
the
carpenter
case,
unless
that
newspaper
column
was
distributed,
there
would
be
no
benefit
from
trading
on
the
inside
information.
you
have
to
be
able
to
look
at
the
mailing
and
see
that
because
of
that
mailing
something
of
assistance
to
the
fraud.
and
the
point
is
the--
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
--well--
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
--i
think
that
case--
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
--i
think
that
case--
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
--justice
kennedy,
i
think
the
example
you
cite
is
more
akin
to
pereira
where
the
$35,000
bank
check
was
mailed
from
one
bank
to
another
for
collection
before
it
was
paid.
i
myself
feel
that
the
pereira
case
is
not
reconcilable
with
kann
and
parr
and
maze.
it
has
been
distinguished
in
those
cases,
but
i
feel
that
it
simply
didn't
apply
the
analysis
of
what
the
core
prohibition
of
the
statute
reached.
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
my
client's
would
have
been
successful.
it
wasn't
my
scheme.
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
because
he
got
his
money
before
the
dealers
resold
the
car.
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
if
the
dealers
had
been
willing
to
accept
the
loss
of
throwing
the
title
outs,
yes.
it
could
have
continued
as
long
as
the
dealers
were
that
dumb.
but
the
fact
is
that,
as
we
know--
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
--no.
i...
i
think
it's
obvious
that
these
mailings
occurred,
and
anyone
could
have
seen
they
would
have
occurred.
what
i
see
a
lack
of
is
a
lack
of
connection.
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
the
sale
of
cars
in
general
can't
persist
without
mailings
of
title
registrations.
the
scheme
didn't
depend
upon
the
registration
of
title
as
in
any
way--
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
--it
depended
upon
repeated
tamperings
with
odometers.
if
he
had...
if
he
had
been
selling
the
cars
without
tampering
with
odometers,
it
wouldn't
have
been
mail
fraud
even
under
the
government's
construction.
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
exactly.
and
in
this
case,
the
only
fraud
was
odometer
tampering
fraud.
and
the
mailings
were
pursuant
to
a
state
regulation
whose
whole
purpose
it
is--
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
--if
you--
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
--mr.
chief
justice,
if
you
accept
that
line
of
analysis,
then
any
person
who
tampers
with
an
odometer
had
better
be
prepared
to
face
mail
fraud
charges
because
somebody
sooner
or
later
is
going
to
register
that
car.
when
you
tamper
with
an
odometer--
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
--well,
it
says
no
person
shall
disconnect,
reset
or
alter
the
odometer
with
intent
to
change
the
number
of
miles
indicated
thereon.
but
as
a
practical
matter,
you
don't
do
it
if
you're
not
expecting
to
sell
the
car.
that's
true.
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
i
can't
conceive
of
how
the
case
would
come
to
the
attention
of
the
u.s.
attorney.
so,
although
it
might
technically
be
an
offense,
i
don't
think
you'd
be
prosecuted
for
it.
if
you
disclosed
when
you're
selling
the
car
that
you
did
change
the
odometer,
i
don't
think
that
it's
an
offense.
but
the
offense
that
we're
talking
about
is
odometer
tampering,
and
the
question
is
is
every
person
who
tampers
with
an
odometer
going
to
be
guilty
of
mail
fraud
when
somebody
down
the
line
mails
in
that
title.
and
under
this
theory--
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
--well,
mr.
maze
ran
up
a
bill
on
several
different
credit
card
charges.
the
defendants
in
kann
made
repeated
mailings.
if
it...
if
a
single
instance
isn't
within
the
core
prohibition
of
the
statute,
the
repetition
still
doesn't
bring
it
within
the
core
prohibition
of
the
statute.
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
i
believe,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
was
a
summer
vacation--
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
--as
you
indicated
in
the
opinion
that
you
wrote
for
the
court.
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
well,
in
maze
in
the
dissent
it
was
described
as
a
$2,000
spree.
i
don't
know
how
much
profit
my
client
derived
from
his
conduct,
but
in
kann
it
was
an
ongoing
scheme.
in
parr
it
was
an
ongoing
scheme.
in
each
case
the
mailings
helped
in
a
practical
way
because
they
got
the
money
to
the
individuals
in
those
cases.
but
in
each
case
there
wasn't
anything
about
the
mailings
that
practically
advanced
the
scheme.
and
if
you
don't
look
at
whether
there's
a
practical
assistance
to
the
scheme
in
terms
of
helping
the
fraud,
not
simply
completing
the
sale
or
collecting
the
taxes,
you...
you
open
up
a
floodgate
of
prosecution.
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
scalia,
i
disagree.
the
fraud
here
was
odometer
tampering.
we
don't
usually
consider
a
person
who
tampers
with
odometers
as
not
committing
some
kind
of
a
fraud.
as
a
practical
matter,
that's
the
business
they're
in.
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
the
reason
it's
prohibited
is
because
that
kind
of
conduct
is
typically
associated
with
fraud.
and
in
this
particular
case,
the
indictment...
there
has
been
some
discussion
back
and
forth
in
the
briefs
about
whether
the
indictment
did
or
did
not
charge
odometer
tampering.
i
think
paragraph
4
makes
it
clear
that
my
client
was
charged
with
having
caused
to
be
altered
the
odometers
so
that
they
reflected
inaccurate
mileage.
and
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
the
indictment
did,
in
fact,
list
the
elements
of
odometer
tampering.
i'd
like
to
move
on
to
the
issue
of
the
lesser
included
offense
instruction.
in
the
cases
of
keeble
and
beck,
the
analysis
that
this
court
used
focused
on
the
prejudicial
effect
of
the
evidence
which
was
received
upon
the
fairness
of
the
jury's
verdict.
and
in
the
geiger
case,
the
california
case
that
i
cite
in
my
briefs,
the
alr
note
to
that
case
lists
a
number
of
states
which
use
a
rule
more
liberal
than
the
strict
elements
rule.
it
seems
to
be
a
perfectly
good
rule.
in
the
keeble
case
itself,
the
court
noted
in
footnote
19
the
existence
of
the
whitaker
case,
the
seconal
case
on
the
inherent
relationship
standard.
and
it
noted
the
abandonment
of
mutuality
and
specifically
reserved
ruling
on
the
propriety
of
that.
so,
i
don't
think
that
the
keeble
case
is
authority
for
saying
that
whitaker
and
the
abandonment
of
mutuality
are
disapproved
by
this
court.
now,
in
this
case
the
jury
was
out
for
almost
three
hours.
this
is
a
simple
case,
and
the
only
thing
the
jury
could
have
been
out
considering
was
is
this
really
mail
fraud.
are
these
mailings
really
sufficiently
closely
related
to
what
my
client
was
trying
to
do
to
be
mail
fraud?
i
think
it's
clear
from
that
record
that
a
lesser
instruction
on
odometer
tampering
had
at
least
an
arguable
chance
of
success.
i
think
it
arguably
would
have
changed
the
outcome
of
the
case.
and
the
double
jeopardy
issue
raised
by
the
government
i
think
is
a
red
herring.
the
blockburger
test
for
a
lesser
offense
using
the
elements
has
been
noted
by
this
court
as
simply
a
shorthand
method
of
determining
legislative
intent.
and
even
if
the
blockburger
test
says
that
one
offense
is
an
included
offense
of
another,
if
the
legislative
intent
is
to
impose
double
punishment,
it's
proper.
as
in
the
garrett
case,
as
in
a
case
cited
in
the
supplementary
brief
in...
before
the
court
of
appeals,
missouri
versus
hunter,
the
armed
robbery
and
armed
criminal
action
can
be
punished
as
separate
offenses.
both
our
side
and
the
government's
side
agreed
in
the
supplemental
briefs
filed
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
double
jeopardy
analysis
shouldn't
be
used
to
determine
this
issue.
in
the
government's
supplemental
brief
at
page
10,
you'll
find
that
concession.
so,
i
would
submit
that
in
fact
the
only
way
to
preserve
fairness
in
a
situation
where
there
is
a
potential
for
juries
being
influenced
by
proof
of
one
crime
is
by
looking,
in
fact,
at
the
evidence
in
order
to
determine
what
instruction
is
appropriate.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court:
i
don't
think
that
my
client's
scheme
was
successful.
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
right.
[laughter]
in
fact,
i
think
that
every
time
he
repeated
his
offense,
it
raised
the
probability
that
he
would
ultimately
be
caught.
the
large
number
of
transfers
of
title,
the
large
number
of
cars
that
he
sold--
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
--yes,
but
he
should
have
been
caught,
justice
stevens,
for
odometer
tampering.
and
this
reminds
me...
this
case
reminds
me
of
a
story
abraham
lincoln
used
to
use
to
illustrate
a
point.
you'll
find
this
in
carl
sandburg's
biography.
by
way
of
illustration,
how
many
legs
will
a
sheep
have
if
you
call
his
tail
a
leg?
only
four
because
calling
a
tail
a
leg
doesn't
make
it
one.
i
don't
think
that
calling
odometer
tampering
mail
fraud
makes
it
mail
fraud.
now,
what
was
in
these
title
registration
documents
that
we
think
was
so
bad
for
the
scheme?
well,
among
other
things,
the
address
of
the
person
who
had
sold
the
car
to
my
client
was
in
those
title
documents.
so,
how
did
they
prove
the
case?
they
wrote
to
those
addresses.
they
said
can
you
give
us
the
odometer
statement
you
really
gave
mr.
schmuck,
and
they
got
it.
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
well,
he
had
no
control.
after
he
sold--
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
--the...
this
brings
up
my
point
about
the
relationship
between
the
requirements
that
automobile
titles
be
registered
and
the
purpose
of
that
registration.
the
purpose
is
precisely
to
make
it
tough
on
people
like
my
client.
and
i
don't
think
that
you
can
bootstrap
by
a
regulatory
measure
like
this
a
fraud
of
odometer
tampering
into
a
mail
fraud,
just
as
you
couldn't
bootstrap
in
mcnally
mailing
your
tax
returns
in
into
mail
fraud.
knowingly
and
willfully
does
simply
not
distinguish
the
elements
of
odometer
tampering
from
mail
fraud.
in
the
joint
appendix
on
page
72
in
the
panel
decision,
footnote
1,
the
court
dealt
quite
peremptorily
with
that
arguments.
knowingly
and
willfully
means
exactly
what
it
says
rather
than
contains
a
hidden
requirements.
in
our
reply
brief
on
this
point,
we
cited
justice
learned
pand
in
american
surety
company
versus
sullivan
saying
the
word
"willful"
means
no
more
than
that
the
person
charged
with
the
duty
knows
what
he
is
doing.
so,
knowingly
and
willfully
is
not
an
element
that
needs
to
be
specifically
stated
in
the
indictment.
debit
and
blackmur's
jury
instructions
recommend
that
no...
no
explanation
of
knowingly
and
willfully
be
made
where
it
appears
in
the
statute.
i
don't
think
that's
a
valid
grounds
for
saying
that
the
indictment
didn't
charge
odometer
tampering.
but
more
importantly,
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
evidence
to
see
if
the
outcome
was
unfair.
in
this
particular
case
there
was
a
cartload
of
evidence
about
odometer
tampering.
we
objected
to
much
of
it
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
going
to
prejudice
the
jury.
the
jury
panel
on
voir
dire...
half
of
them
knew
all
about
odometer
tampering.
some
of
them
were
excused
because
of
it.
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
well,
justice
scalia,
when
the
court
applies
the
elements
test
and
gives
a
lesser
instruction,
they're
doing
the
same
thing.
they're
overriding
the
prosecutor's
prerogative.
it
doesn't
really
matter
what
the
test
is.
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
well,
i
have
more
confidence
in
the
federal
judiciary.
i
feel
that
they're
not
going
to
go
around
undermining
strong
cases
with
frivolous
instructions.
but
i
think
in
this
case
we
were
the
victim
of
the
jury's
hostility
to
odometer
tampering.
i
mention
in
my
brief
the
comment
that
the
government's
attorney
made
in
his
rebuttal
argument
about
how
if
you
do
any
type
of
crime,
you
should
pay
for
it.
it
was
clear
invitation
to
say,
well,
he's
certainly
guilty
of
something,
and
we
can't
let
him
go.
and
that's
what
the
court
didn't
like
in
keeble.
you're
correct,
justice
stevens.
in
keeble,
the
lesser
offense
was
not
even
in
the
federal
statutes,
but
they,
nevertheless,
said
to
be
fair,
we
have
to
let
the
defendant
have
the
benefit
of
this
rule.
we
don't
want
to
induce
an
unfair
verdict.
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
it
may
less--
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
--they
only
proved
12,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
we
would
have
been
happy
to
take
12
counts
of
odometer
tampering.
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
yes.
she
should
have
instructed
that
you
may
find
on
each
count.
if
you
can't
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
he's
guilty
of
mail
fraud,
you
may
consider
whether
he's
guilty
of
odometer
tampering.
now,
we
weren't
even
permitted...
my
erstwhile
partner
who
argued
the
case
to
the
jury
wasn't
even
permitted
to
say
to
the
jury,
well,
this
is
really
not
mail
fraud.
this
is
really
odometer
tampering.
don't
let
the
government
get
away
with
overcharging.
now,
if
we're
not
even
allowed
to
suggest
to
the
jury
that
it's
overcharging
and
if
the
government
is
allowed
to
make
the
kind
of
argument
that
says
he
has
done
something,
so
convict
him
of
what
we've
got
him
here
for,
i
think
we've
been
the
victim
of
unfair
use
of
the
jury's
hostility
to
odometer
tampering.
nobody
likes
odometer
tampering.
it's
not--
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
--in
fact,
mail
fraud
is
now
a
felony
too
although
it's
only
a
three-year
felony.
so,
congress...
excuse
me--
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
--odometer
tampering
has
been
raised
to
the
level
of
a
felony
by
the
truth
in
mileage
act
of,
i
believe,
1986.
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
well,
if
as
judge
crabb
indicated,
the
question
of
whether
these
mailings
were
or
were
not
in
furtherance
of
the
scheme
was
a
jury
question,
and
she
did
let
it
go
to
the
jury,
then
yes.
it
may
have
been
sufficient
taking...
assuming
that
it
was
sufficient
for
the
jury
to
find
mail
fraud,
it
was
also
sufficient
for
the
jury
to
not
find
mail
fraud
as
the
judge
instructed
it.
but
by
failing
to
give
us
the
lesser
included
offense
instruction,
the
jury
was
given
an
up
or
down
choice.
and
if
they
had
been
given
the
third
option,
i'm
confident
that
that's
what
they
would
have
done.
they
were
out
for
three
hours
in
a
very
simple
case.
as
to
what
the...
one
other
thing
the
title
documents
included,
they
did
in
9
out
of
the
12
cases
include
an
odometer
mileage
statement.
it's
now
compulsory
for
every
state.
they...
as
i
said,
they
included
the
addresses
of
the
prior
owners
so
that
it
was...
they
were
a
useful
tool.
when
congress
passed
the
truth
in
mileage
act,
they
talked
about
how
useful
these
records
were
going
to
be
to
catch
odometer
tamperers.
and
to
me,
as
i've
said
before,
it
seems
incongruous
to
say
that
a
regulatory
scheme
set
up
to
inhibit,
deter
and
detect
this
fraud
is
nevertheless
going
to
raise
it
to
a
higher
level
because
it
was
complied
with
not
by
my
client,
but
by
the
people
he...
the
victims.
the
victims
of
the
scheme
were
both
the
dealers
and
the
retail
purchasers.
that's
what
the
indictment
said,
and--
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
--yes?
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
well,
justice
scalia--
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
--well--
mr.
peter
l.
steinberg
--for
the
purposes
of
analyzing
whether
he
knew
it
was
going
to
happen
or
not
under
the
rule
of
pereira,
he
caused
it
because
he
could
have
foreseen
that
it
happened.
but
in
order
to
determine
what
execution
of
the
scheme
means,
you
simply
have
to
lock
at
the
statutory
history...
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
which
indicated
the
main
thrust
of
it
was
to
keep
people
from
sending
out
circulars
advertising
things
that
they
then
didn't
deliver,
and
you
have
to
lock
at
the
relevant
cases,
kann
and
parr
and
maze,
which
i
feel
state
quite
clearly
it
takes
more
than
just
a
mailing.
it
takes
more
than
the
proof
of
a
fraudulent
scheme
plus
some
connected
mailing
to
make
a
case
mail
fraud.
xxx
time
is
up.
