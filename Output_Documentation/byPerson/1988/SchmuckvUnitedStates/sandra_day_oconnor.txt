mr.
martin,
why
wasn't
it
complete
when
the
cars
were
sold
to
the
dealers?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
he
wanted
his
money.
and
why
isn't
it
complete
when
the
dealers
bought
the
car?
he
wasn't
getting
the
money
from
the
ultimate
consumer.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
all
dealers
are
going
to
resell.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i'm
not
sure
that
that
means
that
the
offense
isn't
complete
when
the
dealers
bought
it.
what
if
the
cars
had
been
destroyed
by
a
fire
or
something
while
in
the
dealer?
would
the
government
take
the
position
there
had
been
no
fraud?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
he
had
sold
them
to
the
dealers,
gotten
his
money,
and
the
car
is
destroyed.
no
fraud?
