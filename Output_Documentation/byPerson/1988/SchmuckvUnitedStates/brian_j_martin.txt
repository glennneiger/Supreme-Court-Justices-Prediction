mr.
brian
j.
martin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
first
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
there
was
enough
evidence
for
the
jury
to
find
that
petitioner
schmuck
used
the
mails
to
further
his
scheme
to
defraud.
the
indictment
alleges
and
defines
that
scheme.
it
states
that
from
on
or
about
july
1,
1979
until
on
or
about
july
30,
1980,
defendant
wayne
t.
schmuck
did
devise
and
intend
to
devise
a
scheme
to
defraud
persons
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
who
would
be
and
were
induced
to
purchase
automobiles
from
wisconsin
dealers
on
which
schmuck
had
caused
the
odometer
mileage
to
be
altered.
the
government
alleged
and
proved
an
ongoing
scheme.
the
victims
of
that
scheme
were
the
retail
purchasers.
they
testified
at
trial
that
they
relied
on
the
false
odometer
readings
when
they
made
their
purchase
decisions.
and,
indeed,
petitioner's
counsel
at
trial
conceded
to
the
jury
that
their
testimony
showed
that
his
client
had
devised
a
scheme
to
defraud
within
the
meaning
of
the
mail
fraud
statute.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
because
mr.
schmuck
was
in...
in
the
business
of...
a
continuing
business
of
selling
cars
to
the
public
through
dealers.
the
evidence
shows
that
he
sold
some--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--he
sold
to
dealers
with
the
understanding
that
they
would
resell.
he
sold
continuously.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
absolutely,
absolutely.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
well,
there
would...
if...
if
there
was
no
resales--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--certainly
there
would
be
no
fraud
at
the
retail
level.
the
dealers
would
have
been
defrauded.
i
don't
know
if
the
mails
would
have
been
used
in...
in
furtherance
of
that
fraud.
the
evidence
showed
that
he
sold
some
300
cars
in...
in
the
two
years
in
question
here.
he
was
in...
had
a
continuing
relationship
with
the
dealers.
the
demand
for
his
cars
was
created
at
the
retail
level.
the
more
the
retail
level
persons
would
buy
from
the
dealers,
the
more
the
dealers
would
buy
from
petitioner.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
yes.
two
of
the
dealers
who
testified
at
trial
purchased
on
many
occasions,
five
times
for
one
dealer,
five
times
for
another
dealer,
and
that's
just
of
the
12...
or
12
counts
of
this
case.
we
don't
know
how
many
times
in
all
that
they
purchased
from
mr.
schmuck,
but
two
of
the
dealers
had
a
relationship
of
many,
many
years.
and
of
the
four
dealers
in
this
case,
two
of
them
had
five
mailings,
two
other
had
five
mailings,
and
there
was
one
apiece--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--they
developed
a
business
relationship
with
him.
it
was
a
good
business
relationship.
it
was
profitable
to
them.
he
would
call
them
up
and
say
i
have
these
cars.
they've
been
reliable
in
the
past.
so,
the
dealers
would
rely
on
mr.
schmuck
in
that
way.
we
have
not
understood
petitioner's
claim
to
be
a
challenge
to
the
scope
of
the
indictment
or
the
alleged
fraud.
rather
he
claims
that
the
mails...
mailing
of
title
papers
cannot,
as
a
matter
of
law,
be
in
furtherance
of
such
a
fraud.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
that
has
not
been--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--that
has
not
been
our
understanding.
at
trial
he...
he
did
not
challenge
the
factual
point
that
the
government
was
making
that
it
was
a
continuing
business,
that
it
mattered
to
him
that
these
cars
were
resold
in
the
way
that
would
matter
to
general
motors
that
its
dealers
sell
cars
to
the
public.
that's
where
the
demand
for
his
cars
was
created.
that
was
not
challenged
by
petitioner
at
trial,
and
we
have
not
understood
that
to
be
the
basis
of
their
challenge
in
this
court.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
exactly.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
yes.
the
mailings
in
this
case
were
all
title
applications
for
the
retail
purchasers.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
and
mailed
by
the
dealers.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
not
by
schmuck,
although
schmuck...
the
evidence
shows
that
schmuck
knew
that
the
dealers
customarily
mailed
applications.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
it's...
it's
not
in
the
appendix,
but
it
is
in
the
record.
exhibits
1
through
12
are
the
title
applications.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
yes.
the
reason
this
scheme
would
work
is
that
at
the
time
illinois
titling
laws
did
not
require
mileage.
wisconsin
did.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
but
the
first
mileage
in
wisconsin
titling
records
was
the
false
odometer
mileage
that
mr.
schmuck
recorded
when
he
applied
for
wisconsin
titles
or
when
the
dealer
did.
so,
that's
why
this
scheme
worked.
if
you
look
at
the
titling
papers,
there's
no
evidence
of
any
fraud
because
the
first
odometer
reading
in
the
title
papers
is
the
false
one.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
yes.
these
were
cars
that...
mr.
schmuck
is
a
resident
of
illinois.
this
is
where
his
business
ran.
and
these
cars
were...
were
sold
at
retail
in
wisconsin.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
it
was
the
false...
it
was
the
false
odometer
reading.
but
that's
the
first
reading.
so,
if
you
compare
it
to
subsequent
readings,
when
the
car
is
resold,
there's
no
evidence
of
any
odometer
tampering
which
is
actually
one
of
the
benefits
of
the
titling
system
is
that
if
you
look
at
the
papers,
you
see
no
evidence
of
a
fraud.
there's
a
certain
lulling
effect.
mr.
schmuck
has
contended
all
along
that
it's
a
matter
of
law,
titling
papers
are
counterproductive,
they
cannot
benefit
a
scheme
to
defraud.
well,
in
fact,
the
evidence
would
support
a
finding
here
that
the
existence
of
title
laws
which
he
could
circumvent,
figure
out
a
way
to
get
around,
actually
had
a
lulling
effect.
but
the--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--well,
i...
i
think
our
point
is
that
an
average
retail
customer
understands
that
titling
laws
are
there
for
protection
of
customers,
maybe
to
some
extent
to
protection
from
odometer
tampering.
and
if
the
records
do
not
indicate
a
fraud,
there's
an
additional
lulling
effect
over
and
above
an
average
mailing.
but
the
primary
benefit
in
this
case
was
that...
was
that
the
mailings
were
necessary
to
effect
the
transaction.
and
that's
all
that
the
mail
fraud
statute
requires
is
that
the
mailing
be
incident
to
an
essential
part
of
the
scheme
or
step
in
the
plot
of
the
scheme.
and
the
sale
could
not
be
made
without
the
title
papers
being
sent
to
the
department
of
transportation.
that's
clear.
you
cannot
get
a
license
plate.
you
cannot
drive
the
car
in
the
wisconsin.
the
dealers
could
not
have
sold
the
cars.
that's
the
primary
benefit...
primary
benefit
to
petitioner
in
this
case.
in
every
case
where
this
court
has
found
that
a
particular
mailing
was
not
in
furtherance
or
in
execution
of
a
scheme,
the
court
has
been
unable
to
find
any
material
benefit
to
the
defendant.
and
that
has
been
true
in
maze
and
in
parr
and
in
kann.
but
here
the
benefits
were
the
sale
was
completed.
the
dealers
would
come
back
for
more
cars.
and
there
was
the
additional
lulling
effect
of
making
the
appearance
appear
perfectly
traditional.
no
one
was
the
wiser.
we
heard
this
morning
that
mr.
schmuck
clearly
violated
the
odometer
law
and
he
should
have
been
charged
with
that.
but
this
court
has
held
in
batchelder
that
the
government
may
select
between
two
fully
applicable
statutes.
so
the
question
only
is
whether
the
evidence
supported
the
verdict
of
mail
fraud
in
this
case.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
he
was
not
charged
with
odometer
tampering
in
the
indictment.
as
part
of
the
scheme
to
defraud
in
which
he
used
the
mails,
one
of
the
factual
allegations
in
the
indictment
is
that
he
caused
odometers
to
be
turned
back.
but
it
does
not
even
state
all
the
elements
of
the
odometer
violation
because
there's
a
knowing
and
willful
requirement
which
is
not
set
forth
in
the
indictment
at...
at
that
stage.
i'll
turn
now
to
the
next
issue
which
is
whether
petitioner
was
entitled
to
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction
on
odometer
tampering.
and
this
requires
the
court
to
interpret
rule
31(c)
of
the
criminal
rules
and
the
language
that
a
jury
may
return
a
verdict
on
any
offense
necessarily
included
in
the
crime
charged.
we
believe
that
rule
31(c)
adopts
the
statutory
elements
test
that
a
lesser
included
offense
is
defined
by
the
elements
of...
of
the
statute.
every
violation
of
the
greater
offense
necessarily
includes
a
violation
of
the
lesser
offense.
we
believe
our
interpretation
is
most
consistent
with
the
language
of
31(c)
and
the
phrase
"necessarily
included".
mr.
brian
j.
martin
it's
stated
in
full
in
petitioner's
brief.
in
our
brief--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--page
19
has
the
"necessarily
included"
language
of
our
brief.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
we
believe
that
points
to
an
abstract
examination
of
the
statutory
elements
of
two
crimes
and
not
to
the
facts
of
a
particular
case.
one
offense
is
not
necessarily
included
in
another
simply
because
in
one
case
defendant
happens
to
commit
both.
rather
we
think
that
offenses
necessarily
included
in
another--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--we
cite
it
on
page
19
and
quote
a
phrase.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
the
entire
rule...
the
entire
rule
is
in
petitioner's
brief
on
page
2...
or
page
2.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
we
felt
it
was
necessary
to
set
forth
the
"necessarily
included"
language.
we
left
out
the
other
six
or
seven...
six
or
seven
words
in
31(c).
our
lead
argument
in
our
brief
is
based
on
the
history
of
31(c)
and
not
the
language
because
we...
we
think
the
language
is
open
to
dispute,
but
the
history
is
not.
the
advisory
committee
notes
state
31(c)
was
intended
to
adopt
and
restate
existing
law.
and
we
explain
in
our
brief
what
the
existing
law
was
and
that
was
the
statutory
elements
test.
this
court
applied
it
in
the
19th
century
under
the
then
effective
statute.
the
ninth
circuit
applied
it
two
months
before
31(c)
was
adopted,
and
many
state
and
lower
federal
courts
had
applied
it
in
the
interim.
and
in
petitioner's
reply
brief,
he
has
not
questioned
our
history,
but
instead
relies
on
the
inherent
relationship
test
which
seems
to
find
its
origins
in
the
1971
opinion
of
the
d.c.
circuit
in
whitaker.
we
also
think
that
the
statutory
elements
test
was
the
implicit
understanding
of
this
court
in
the
berra
decision
and
in
the
sansone
decision
when
it
considered
whether
the
failure
to
pay
a
tax
is
a
lesser
included
offense
of
tax
evasion.
the
court
compared
statutory
elements
and
concluded
that,
yes,
it
is
a
lesser
included
offense.
but
under
the
facts
of
that
case,
no
instruction
was
required.
so,
we
basically
think
that
31(c)
adopts
the
statutory
elements
test,
and
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
the
language
and
the
history
support
that.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
sure.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
i
do
recall
the
case.
this
court
held
under
the
major
crimes
act
that
lesser
included
offense...
i...
i
believe
that
the
court
applied
an
elements
test.
and
i
think
they
looked
to--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--as
i
remember,
this
court
held
that
the
lesser
included
offense
was
assimilated
necessarily
implied
in
the
major
crimes
act.
and
that
was...
the
whole
point
of
the
decision
was
the
lesser
included
offense
in...
included
implicitly
in
the
major
crimes
act.
and
this
court
said,
yes.
basically
it
was
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
as
we
understand
the
case.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
we
also
think
that
the
elements
test
is
the
better
rule
although
the
court
need
not
address
that
aspect
of
it
because
we
think
it
is
a
required
rule.
but
we
think
it's
clear
and
certainly
much
simpler
to
apply.
both
sides
know
in
advance
the
possible
charges
to
the
instruction,
the
possible
convictions
that
the
jury
could
return.
and--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--certainly.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
it
doesn't
say
knowingly
and
willfully,
but...
so,
there
could
be
a
challenge
if...
if--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--it's
close.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
uh-hum,
uh-hum,
uh-hum.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
well--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--i
think
it's...
the
statutory
elements
test
is
still
easier,
and
that's
apparent
from
the
panel
opinion
in
this
case
because
the
alternative
is
the
so-called
inherent
relationship
test.
no
circuit...
no...
petitioner
does
not
advocate
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction
whenever
the
evidence
would
support
such
an
instruction
or
support
a
finding
that
the
defendant
committed
that
crime.
they
tack
on
the
inherent
relationship
test
to
avoid
abuse
by
defendants.
now,
what
does
it
mean
to
have
an
inherent
relationship?
the
panel
and
this
court
disagree.
we're
not
sure.
and
that's
where
we
think
that
the
difficulties
in
application
counsel
in
favor
of
the
elements
test,
which
this
court
applies
in
double
jeopardy
contexts
[inaudible]
and
woodward
the
court
applied
it
in
determining
whether
congress
intended
dual
punishment
under
two
separate
statutes.
there
can
be
difficulties
in
applying
the
elements
test.
that's
a
matter
of
congressional
intent
and
reading
of
statutes,
and...
but
if
you
find
one...
one
crime
in
title
18,
another
in
title
27,
it
may
be
difficult
to
determine
whether
the
elements
test
is
satisfied.
but
we--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--right.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
absolutely.
there
would
have
to
be
enough
evidence
to
support
a
verdict
to
that
effect
and
an
acquittal
on
the
greater
offense.
if
in
a
typical
case
the...
the
evidence
would
either
support
an
outright
acquittal
or
a
conviction
on
the
greater
offense,
then
the
lesser
included
offense
should
not
be
given.
there
has
to
support
a
rational
jury
finding
the
defendant
innocent
on
the
greater
offense.
one
of
the
outside
elements
is
hotly
contested.
perhaps
it's
intent
perhaps
it's
willfulness,
whatever
it
is.
in
such
a
case,
then
a
lesser
included
offense
may
be
required.
the
court
in
berra
actually
made
that
point.
and
we
think
lastly
that
the
elements
test
respects
the
role
of
the
government
and
the
grand
jury
as
the
charging
instrument
in
criminal
matters.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
where
it's
necessarily
included,
and
the
evidence
is
hotly
contested
on
the
element
which
makes
the
greater
offense
the
greater
offense
so
that
a
rational
jury
could
find
the
government
hasn't
proved
the
greater
offense,
but
has
proved
the
lesser
offense.
then
the
instruction
is
appropriate--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--then--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--well,
sometimes
the
contest
will
so
equally
to
both
the
lesser
and
greater
offense,
however.
if
the
defense
is
i
wasn't
there,
i
wasn't...
you've
got
the
wrong
person,
well
then
a
rational
jury
would
not
make
a
distinction
between
a
lesser
and
greater
offense.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
you're
not
entitled
to
the
instruction.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
it's
probably
explained
more
from
the
history
than...
than
logic,
and
i
direct
the
court
to
the
stevenson
opinion,
and
berra
and
the
entire
history
of
lesser
included
offense
instructions.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
yes.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
i
don't
know
which...
what
legal
rule
would
support
that.
it
seems
to
be
at
odds
with
the
government
and
the
grand
jury's
role
