we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
87-1346,
bonito
boats
v.
thunder
craft
boats.
mr.
russell,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
can
affirm
on,
on
a,
a
basis
not
relied
upon
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
is
that
where
this
came
from?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
ground
has
to
have
been
maintained
in
that
court,
as
i
understand
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
mr.
russell.
mr.
lipsey,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's,
what's
your
answer
to
the
question
about
that
house
at
14th
street?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
you
do,
you
do
have
statements
in
the
patterson
case
that
the
patent
laws
were
not
designed
to
displace
the
police
power
of
the
state.
you
can
certainly
distinguish
patterson,
but
there
is
that
language
in
the
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lipsey.
mr.
russell,
you
have
eight
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
sears...
sears...
sears-compco
you
car
say
was
an
exercise
of
state
police
power
too,
if
you
mean
by
police
power
the
reserve
power
of
any
state
to
operate
in
an
area
unless
prohibited
by
federal
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how,
how
does
that
distinguish...
are
there,
are
there
some
state
laws
in
your
view
that
wouldn't
come
under
the
state
police
power?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
usually
it's
used
just
as
a,
as
a
shorthand
for
those
laws
the
state
has,
has
a
right
to
enforce,
really.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you,
you
may
be
right,
but
i
think
it
doesn't
depend
on
whether
or
not
you,
you,
you
use
the
word
"police
power"
in
any
specialized
sense.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
russell.
the
case
is
submitted.
