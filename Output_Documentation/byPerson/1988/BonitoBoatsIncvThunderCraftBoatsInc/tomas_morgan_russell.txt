mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
for
review
the
issue
of
whether
a
state
unfair
competition
statute
enacted
pursuant
to
state
police
power
can
exist
harmoniously
with
the
federal
patent
laws.
we
submit
that
it
can.
the
cases
here,
on
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
which
held
that
the
florida
statute
unconstitutional
on
sears-compco
grounds.
three
reasons
support
reversal
of
the
florida
supreme
court.
one,
the
sears-compco
cases
are
clearly
distinguishable,
were
misapplied
below,
and
are
not
controlling
here.
two,
the
florida
statute
does
not
clash
with
the
purposes
and
the
effects
of
the
patent
laws.
and
three,
the
florida
statute
is
a
legitimate
exercise
of
the
state
police
power
to
regulate
unfair
competition.
a
long
line
of
decisions
of
this
court
has
approved
and
upheld
as
constitutional
these
state
statutes,
even
when
they
totally
banned
the
manufacture
and
use
of
patented
or
unpatented
articles
or
processes.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
justice
o'connor,
quite
clearly
boat
hulls
could
be
patented,
have
been
patented,
in
the
past.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
i
don't
know
whether
they
tried
to
obtain
a
patent
or
not,
but
quite
clearly
the
boat
in
issue
in
this
case
was
not
patented.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
that
raises
a
procedural
issue,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
the
direct
answer
to
your
question
is
quite
clearly
no.
but
it
raises
a
question
as
to
whether
the
review
of
the
copyright
preemption
issue
is
properly
before
the
court.
we
take...
we
noted
in
page
13,
footnote
five
of
our
reply
brief,
we
took
the
position
that
the
copyright
issue
was
not
properly
before
the
court,
relying
on
supreme
court
rule
21.1,
and
we
would
like
to
rely
on
the
recent
case
of
barkers
life
v.
crenshaw,
which
is
now
reported
at
108(a),
supreme
court
1645,
a
decision
handed
down
last
may
16.
we
take
that
position
because
the
copyright
preemption
issue
was
not
within
the
scope
of
the
petition
when
it
was
granted
in
this
case.
it's
an
issue
which
has
not
been
pressed
or
passed
on
below.
it
is
a...
an
issue--
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
--yes,
i
believe
the
court
can.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
yes,
sir,
that's
true.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
yes,
sir.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
that's
my
understanding
as
well.
and
the
copyright
preemption
issue
has
not
been
raised
or
pressed
or
passed
on
by
any
of
the
florida
courts.
it
has
not
within...
it
has
not
been
briefed
by
counsel;
we
have
no
judicial
decisions
on
the
copyright
issue
below.
this
issue
is
being
raised
de
novo
in
this
court,
and
it's
being
raised
by
amici,
not
by
the
parties.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
the
right...
may
i
first
back
to,
justice
o'connor,
and
fully
answer
your,
your
prior
question
as
to
whether
it
would
be
a
sculptural
work?
it
quite
clearly
is
not
under
301
for
three
reasons:
301
preempts
as
to
the
subject
matter
of
copyright,
as
specified
in
102,
but
102(b)
specifically
excludes
a
process.
secondly,
301
applies
to
subject
matter
of
copyright
and
102
includes
pictorial,
graphic,
and
sculptural
works.
and
that
phrase
is
defined
in
101.
in
101
there
is
an
exclusion,
and
the
exclusion
is
that
if
the
design
of
the
useful
article
shall
be
considered
a
pictorial,
graphic
or
sculptural
work,
only
if
and
only
to
the
extent
that
such
design
incorporates
pictorial,
graphic,
or
sculptural
features
that
can
be
identified
separately
from
and
capable
of
existing
independently
of
the
utilitarian
aspects
of
the
article.
now,
these
boats
are
clearly
utilitarian.
so,
it
would
be
considered
a
sculptural
work
only
if
some
aesthetic
feature
could
be
separated
and
identified.
the
third
ground
is
that
section
301
really
doesn't
apply
here
because
the
florida
statute
does
not
create
a
right
equivalent
to
any
of
the
exclusive
rights
specified
in
section
106,
and
that
is
the
right
to
reproduce
copies.
the
florida
statute
just
does
not
create
any
such
right
to
reproduce
copies.
justice
o'connor,
would
you
help
me
by
giving
your
question
again
on
the
patent
law?
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
the
same
thing
was
true
with
the
protection
of
the
sound
recording
master
recording
in
goldstein.
that
is
true.
but
the
right
that
is
granted
for
the
protection
of
the
industry
in
florida
is
exceedingly
narrow,
and
we,
we
submit
does
not
conflict
with
the
purposes
and
effects
of
the
federal
patent
law.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
yes,
justice
stevens,
that's
true.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
they're
both
unpatentable
items.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
yes,
and
i
think
that
is
also
true
with
respect
to
the
master
recordings
that
were
protected
in
perpetuity
in
the
goldstein
case.
i
might
add
that
the
florida
statute
does
not
distinguish...
does
not
operate
as
against
a
patented
product.
it
is
simply
a
separate
independent
cause
of
action
against
a
copier.
one
would
be
a
violation
of
the
monopoly
given
by
the
federal
patent
law,
and
the
second
would
be
a
violation
of
the
florida
statute,
if
the
boat
had
been
copied
using
the
direct
holding
method.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
there
would
clearly
be
an
infringement,
and
there
was
also
clearly
be
a
violation
of
the
florida
statute,
if
it
had
been
copied
using
the
direct
holding
method.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
justice
scalia,
i
think
the
line
has
already
been
drawn
in
the
sears-compco
cases,
and
that
is
whether
it
is
the
equivalent
of
the
federal
patent
laws.
now,
clearly
in
sears-compco,
in
those
cases
no
copying
was
permitted
at
all.
that
was
the
holding
of
the
seventh
circuit
below,
and
quite
clearly
that
is
a
line.
now,
at
the
other
end
of
the
extreme,
we
have
florida
that
prohibits
only
the
direct
molding
method.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
well,
i
can't
say
that
it's
the
simplest,
justice.
there
may
be
many
other
methods
of
copying
that
may
be
simpler
than
the
direct
molding
method.
for
example,
it
can
be
copied
by
hand,
it
can
be
copied
by
measurement,
it
can
be
copied
by
photographic
means.
it
can
be
copied
by
the
use
of
very
sophisticated
computer
equipment.
there
may
be
other
means
that
are,
are
much
easier
and
in
fact
may
even
be
less
expensive
than
the
direct
molding
method.
remember,
the
direct
molding
method
is
a
labor-intensive
method.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
it
is,
it
is--
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
--the
statute
serves
the
purpose,
justice
kennedy,
of
prohibiting
as
unfair
competition
a
practice
which
is
widespread
in
the
marine
industry--
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
--the
purpose
has
the
statute
of
prohibiting
the
practice
which
is
prevalent
commercially
in
the
marketplace
and
is
being
used
today
to
copy
boat
hulls
and
to
take
the
investment
that
the
original
manufacturer
puts
in
producing
a
new,
a
new
product
on
the
market,
with
product
improvements.
it
is
in
effect
an
unfair
taking,
a
misappropriation
of
that
investment.
so
those
are
purposes
that
are
served.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
well,
it
is,
it
is
a
difficult
process.
justice
scalla.
they
have
to
go
buy
the
boat,
take
the
boat
apart,
put
the
hull
upside
down--
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
--it
is,
it
is
an
easier
method
to
copy
than
using
the
traditional
methods
of
developing
and
preparing
a
wooden
plug.
perhaps
it
would
be
helpful
if
i
described
that
process.
a
naval
architect
sits
down
and
designs
a
boat
after
he
is
given
the
parameters
of
the
design
by
the
designers,
and
after
the
designers
learn
from
market
researchers
what
the
public
actually
wants.
the
architect
designs
the
boat
on
a
regular
standard
size,
small
drawings,
and
he
determines
the
contours
of
the
hull,
its
shape
and
its
curvature.
and
then
that
drawing
is
given
to
other
people
and
they
prepare
full-size
drawings.
if
you're
making
a
55-foot
motor
yacht,
you
then
have
drawings
that
are
55
feet
long.
they
then
are
placed
down
on
wood
and
design
of
the
section
on
the
hull
is
then
cut
out
or
the
wood.
and
those
wood
sections
are
then
mounted
on
a
foundation,
starting
at
one
end
of
the
boat
and
going
to
the
other.
and
then
plywood,
strips,
are
nailed
across
those
forms,
which
then
produces
the
contours
of
the
hull.
and
then
a
second
layer
of
wooden
strips
is
glued
on
the
surface
and
then
that
wood
plug
is
sanded
down
very,
very
smooth.
and
then
that
is
used
to
make
a
master
mold.
and
from
the
master
mold
then
are...
production
molds
are
made
that
are
used
on
the
actual
production
lines.
it
quite
clearly
is
true
that
the
direct
molding
method
is
much
simpler,
much
easier,
and
certainly
much
less
expensive
than
the
traditional
method
of
building
a
wood
plug.
that
certainly
is
true.
i
thought
you
were
going
to
the
other
and
of
the
spectrum,
justice.
the
florida
statute
only
prohibits
this
one
method
that
we
have
been
discussing,
the
use
of
a
competitor's
boat
as
the
wooden
plug
to
build
a
production
mold.
and
only
if
it
is
done
for
commercial
purposes.
it
prohibits
only
this
one
limited
method.
it
does
not
prohibit
the
copying
of
boats;
the
boats
themselves
and
the
boat
designs
are
in
the
public
domain,
they
remain
in
the
public
domain.
and
they
may
be
legally
and
freely
copied
in
every
detail
by
anyone
who
so
chooses
to
do
so.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
yes.
there
are
12
states,
justice
blackmun,
that
have
enacted
an
anti-direct
molding
statute.
that
is
the
practice--
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
--thank
you.
i'm
sorry,
justice.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
the
florida
statute
does
not
prohibit
the
use
of
the
direct
molding
process
to
copy
another's
boat
for
non-commercial
purposes.
for
example,
you
want
a
copy,
make
a
boat
of
your
own
as
boy
scouts
sometimes
do
with
canoes,
fine.
if
you
want
to
copy
it
for
research
purposes
or
testing
purposes,
that's
fine.
the
first
argument
that...
that
we
want
to
make
here
is
that
the
sears-compco
cases,
all
clearly
distinguishable
from
this
cases,
and
justice
scalia
your
question
was
right
on
the
heart
of
it.
in
the
sears-compco
cases,
all
forms
of
copying
were
prohibited,
and
here
we
have
only
one
form,
one
form
of
copying.
it's
not
the
equivalent
of
the,
the
law
in
sears-compco,
the
illinois
law
of
unfair
competition,
because
that
was
in
effect
a
monopoly
that
we
enforceable
by
the
state
government.
and
this
court
held
that
unconstitutional,
and
we
believe
correctly
so.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
and
that
is
true
here,
that
is
true
here.
they
may
copy
in
every
detail.
they
may
not
copy
using
direct
molding
method,
that
is
the
only
limitation
here.
and
in
fact
if
you,
if
you...
you
can
copy
in
every
single
detail,
and
it's,
it's
not
objectionable,
because
the
boats
are
in
the
public
domain
and
the
design
is
in
the
public
domain.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
i
would
go
back
to
the
sears-compco
cases
and
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
that
is
the
equivalent
of
the
patent
laws,
and
in
doing
that
i
would
look
to
what
are
the
purposes
and
effects
of
the
state
statute
and
what
are
the
purposes
and
effects
of
the
federal
patent
laws.
and
i
submit
that
they
are
not
inconsistent.
aronson,
decided
by
this
court
in
1979,
set
out
for
purposes
of
the
patent
laws
which...
by
which
a
state
statute
is
to
be
measured
for
supremacy
purposes.
and
the
first
purpose
was
to
foster
and
reward
invention.
the
second
was
to
promote
disclosure
of
inventions
to
the
public.
the
third
was
to
assure
that
ideas
placed
in
the
public
domain
remain
there
for
the
free
use
of
the
public.
now,
the
purposes
of
the
florida
statute
do
not
clash
with
those
purposes.
first
of
all,
the
florida
law
fosters
future
product
improvements.
it
does
so
by
protecting
the
investment
that
is
made
in
the
original
manufacturer
bringing
his
product
to
market
with
an
innovation.
two,
it
protects
the
investment
of
time,
money
and
effort
in
making
the
original
boat.
and
it
therefore
provides
incentive
for
innovation.
it
preserves
an
industry
which
is
endangered
by
a
common
act
of
unfair
competition,
the
direct
molding
method.
that
industry
is
considered,
that
threat
is
considered
a
threat--
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
--well,
we
do
have
a
law
on
unfair
competition,
yes.
now,
i
think
your
question
goes
as
to
whether
it
could
be
actionable
as
misappropriation
under
the
common
law.
quite
clearly
there,
there
is
a
body
of
state
law
of
misappropriation,
yes.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
well,
we
certainly
do
because
it
makes
it
very
clear
that
the
direct
molding
method--
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
--well,
certainly
we
have
statutes
that
have
parallel
rules
that
are
in
the
common
law.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
well,
we
certainly
could
have
brought
the
action
and
tried
to
persuade
a
court
to
do
so.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
it
certainly
is...
it's
much
clearer
if
we
have
a
state
statute
that
says
that
that
is
a--
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
--well,
we
think
clearly
that
it
is
a
proper
exercise
of
the
state
police
power
to
govern
and
set
conditions
on
competition.
free
competition
doesn't
mean
unfettered
competition.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
well,
certainly
this
statute
does
not
provide
it.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
that's
correct.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
i
think
that
would
be
proper.
it
would
be,
it
would
be...
it's
the
same
as
the
license
of
a
trade
secret,
it's
the
same
as
the
license--
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
--it
is
a
license
to
use
the
direct
molding
method
to
copy
something
that
is
in
the
public
domain.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
yes,
that
could
be
true.
it
is
fundamental
that
a
patent
grants
the
right
to
exclude
errors
from
making,
using
or
selling
a
product,
a
machine
or
a
process.
in
effect
it
is
a
property
right,
it
can
be
sold,
licensed,
pledged,
devised.
it
can
be
the
subject
of
a
trust,
it
can
be
the
basis
for
worldwide
patent
protection.
but,
a
patent
does
not
grant
a
right
to
actually
make,
use
or
sell
the
invention.
it
doesn't
give
a
right
to
practice
the
invention.
whether
you
can
practice
your
invention
is
is
a
question
of
whether
the
sale
or
distribution
of
that
product
would
violate
other
laws.
and
here
we
have
our
third
argument,
which
is
the
florida
statute
is
a
valid
exercise
of
florida's
police
power.
the
patent
laws
and
the
state
police
power
have
existed
in
harmony
for
many,
many
years.
the
patterson
and
webber
cases
cited
in
our
briefs,
decided
back
in
1879
and
1880...
the
1880
term,
applied
the
patented
and
unpatented
articles.
sears
itself
recognizes
the
validity
of
the
exercise
of
state
police
power
against
unfair
competition.
in
the
passage
where
it
said
that
the
states
could
establish
requirements
for
the
labeling
of
package
dress
or
to
prevent
deception
of
the
public.
the
broad
range
of
state
authority
to
regulate
intellectual
property
was
reaffirmed
in
the
post
sears-compco
trilogy
of
cases
cited
in
our
brief.
state
competition
laws
regulate
business
ethics,
such
as
misappropriation
of
the
original
investment.
the
florida
state
statute
protecting
investments
in
boat
improvements
is
a
legitimate
exercise
of
police
power.
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
thank
you,
your
honor.
i'll
make
just
a
series
of
very
quick
points
here
in
response,
in
rebuttal,
and
then
save
the
court
some
time,
i
hope.
first
of
all,
the
fact
that
a
patent
has
not
issued
on
a
product
really
is
independent
and
free
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
exercise
of
the
police
power.
the
police
power
can
be
used
by
the
states
to
legitimately
regulate
competition,
whether
or
not
a
product
is
patented.
i
cite
you
to
the
sears
case
itself
when
it
discussed
what
laws
were
applicable
to
patented
products,
and
they
even
cited
the
antitrust
laws.
the
citation
was
to
ibm,
in
the
1936
decision,
and
the
united
shoe
machinery
case
in
1922.
and
that
certainly
is,
is
as
true
here.
florida,
florida
and
11
other
states
have
exercised
their
police
power,
saying
that
this
is
an
improper
method
of
competition
between
competitors.
and
it's
within
their
power
to
do
so.
that
power
was
never
delegated--
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
--well,
i'm
using
the
term
here
in
the
sense
that
it
regulates
for
the
general
welfare
of
the
public
the
health,
safety
and
commerce.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
i
would...
i
can't
think
of
one
right
off
hard,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
--well,
i
think
it
certainly
is
clear
here
that
the
state
has
the
authority
and
the
power
to
regulate
the
conditions
of
competition
within
its
borders.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
yes.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
no,
it
does
not,
your
honor.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
i
think
just
as
florida
could
illinois
could
too.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
but
there
is,
there
is,
there--
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
--it
was
a
total
prohibition
in
sears.
now
remember,
they
couldn't
do
it
in
florida
because
the
florida
statute
only
applies
to
boats.
i
wanted
to
call
the
court's
attention
to--
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
--yes,
i
quite
agree.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
that
would
be
the
parallel.
i
wanted
to
just
point
out
that
the
fact
that--
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
--he
bought
the
hull.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
justice
white,
you're
absolutely
correct.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
to
copy
it
and
make
identical
products
for
commercial
purposes.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
yes,
that's
correct.
that
is
what
the
statute
does.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
for
commercial
purposes,
that's
right.
because
it
is
the
equivalent
of
taking
the
investment
that
the
original
manufacturer
race
in
producing
that
design
and
producing
the
plug
mold.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
not
unless
he
sells
enough
units.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
he
may
not
be
able
to
sell
enough,
if
the
copier's
in
the
marketplace,
in
order
to
recoup
his
investment.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
that
is
certainly
a
risk
of
the
copier.
i
wanted
to
point
out--
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
--absolutely--
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
--legal.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
it
would
technically
be
within
the
statute,
i
think.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
clearly
not
patentable.
but
the
person
that,
that...
i
think,
think
the
rationale
for
the
statute
still
applies,
justice
kennedy,
because
by
the
reverse
engineering,
that
copier
is
in
effect
rebuilding
that
original
product.
he
is
making
the
investment
in
the
product
development
and
then
bringing
that
product
to
market.
so
the
rationale
of
not
taking
the
other
man's
investment,
i
think,
still
applies
here.
i
also
think
it's
important
to
point
out
that
this
court
has
recognized
in
at
least
two
occasions
that
unpatented
improvements
can
still
be
of
immense
value
to
society.
certainly
a
trade
secret
is
not
patented
and
can
be
of
value
to
society.
the
third
point,
i
would
like
to
point
another
limitation
on
the
statute,
which
is
that
the
statute
is
not
limited
to
manufacturers.
the
statute
can
be
invoked
by
a
distributor,
it
can
be
invoked
by
a
retailer,
it
could
be
invoked
by
anyone.
the
point
was
made
that
trade
secret
rights,
or
that
the
rights
under
the
statute
exist
in
perpetuity.
i
think
the
same
thing
is
certainly
true
with
respect
to
trade
secrets.
they
exist
in
perpetuity
until
they're
revealed
in
one
way
or
another.
and
the
right
to
not
copy
the
master
recording
in
goldstein
certainly
was
in
perpetuity,
and
the
court
said
that
the
durational
limitation
did
not
render
it
invalid.
the
state...
the
statute
here
does
not
take
the
direct
molding
process
out
of
the
public
domain.
it
remains
in
the
public
domain.
it
can
be
used
by
anyone
for
any
other
purpose.
no
boat
manufacturer
can
use
the
florida
statute
to
stop
someone
from
copying
teapots
using
the
direct
molding
method.
the
molding
method
remains
completely
in
the
public
domain,
and
it
does
not
create
a
right
to
the
manufacturer
to
exclude
anyone
else
from
using
the
direct
molding
process.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
i
don't
know
offhand
whether
georgia
has
such
a
statute.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
well,
then,
it
certainly
would
not
violate
georgia
law.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
it's
an
in-state
statute.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
i
wanted
to
point
out
that
the--
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
--if
they
can
find
him
in
florida,
i
believe
you're
right,
justice
white.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
in
the
interpart
case,
it
was
upheld
by
the
federal
circuit,
the
actual
copying
was
done
in
formosa.
that
case
involved
automobile
rear
view
mirrors,
and
the
copying
was
done
in
formosa.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
it
could
if
you
can
get
jurisdiction
of
him
within
florida.
mr.
tomas
morgan
russell
that's
exactly
what
happened,
justice
stevens,
in
the
interpart
case.
the
parts
were
copied
in
formosa
and
they
were
imported
into
california,
big
automobile
market.
and
the
action
was
brought
in
california
applying
the
california
anti-direct
molding
statute.
