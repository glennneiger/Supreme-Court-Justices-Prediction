justice
antonin
scalia
right.
well,
your
argument
rests
upon
the
fact
this
is
only
one
way
of
copying?
there
are
other
ways
of
copying.
what,
what
if
florida
had
a
lot
of
other
laws,
each,
each
ore
of
which
only
copies...
only
applies
to
one
manner
of
copying,
but,
but
together
they
cover
all
manners
of
copying?
justice
antonin
scalia
only
the
simplest
method
of
copying?
justice
antonin
scalia
one
suspects
it's
being
used
because
it's
the
easiest.
don't
you
have
that
nagging
suspicion?
that
the
reason
this
is
the
prevalent
method
is
because
it's
the
easiest?
or
you
think
they're
using
the
hardest?
it
is
the
easiest,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
you
say
you
don't
know
it's
easiest.
isn't
that
why
it's
being
used?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
know,
but
compared
to
what?
it's
difficult
compared
to
what?
what's
the
alternative?
i
really
thought
your...
i
really
thought
the
whole
point
in
your
brief
was
that
the
reason
the
florida
law
was
good
is
that
this
is
an
excessively
easy
way
to
copy
things.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
lipsey,
i'd
always
thought
the
patent
law
protects
ideas,
it
protects
discoveries
as
the
constitution
puts
it.
here
florida
is
saying,
you
can
use
that
idea,
you
can
create
hulls
that
like
all
you
like.
but
you
can't
use
this
man's
hull.
what
if
florida
had
a
law
saying,
you
can't...
you...
are
houses
patentable?
can
you
design...
i
presume
you
can
design
a
house
in
a
certain
way
that's,
that's
so
novel
that
it's
patented.
suppose
florida
had
a
law
saying,
you
can't
use
a
photograph
of
anyone's
house
for
commercial
purposes,
without
compensating
that
person.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
would
that
violate
the
patent
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
the
person
hasn't
patented
the
house,
but
has
built
the
house,
and
there's
this
florida
law,
you
can't
use
a
photograph
of
anybody's
house
without
compensation.
now,
if
somebody
violated
that
law,
would
you
say,
or,
this
is
contrary
to
the
united
states
patent
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
don't,
don't
state
laws
all
the
time
prevent
people
from
using
another
person's
product
in
certain
ways?
there
are
all
sorts
of
laws,
even
though
the
products
are
patented...
all,
all
florida
here
is
saying
is
we're
not
interested
in
this
man's
idea,
his
idea
you
car
steal.
he
hasn't
patented
it.
but
doggone
it,
don't
use
his
hull
to
make
another
one.
we're
just
protecting
the
physical
hull.
you
cannot
use
that
hull
to
make
another
hull
out
of
it.
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
ideas?
justice
antonin
scalia
never
mind.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
a
state
can
say
you
can't
reproduce
it
by
a
process
that
involves
nuclear
energy,
or
something
of
that
sort.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
safety
matter.
that's...
one
of
the
state's
police
power
concerns
is
safety.
here,
here
the
state
is
saying
you
can't
do
it
by
using
the
very
individual's...
the
sweat
of
his
very
brew,
using
the
same
physical
hull
that
he
has,
has,
has
produced.
you
want
to
do
it,
produce
your
own
physical
hull.
justice
antonin
scalia
i,
i,
i
mean,
once
you
acknowledge
the
state
can
limit
some
of
the
manners
of
reproduction,
why
isn't
this
a
reasonable
manner
of,
of
limitation?
i
mean,
you're
making
up
the...
you're
making
up
a
principle
you
can
only
limit
it
for
safety
reasons.
where
did
you
get
that
from?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
maybe
you
can't
even
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
there
a
law
requiring
licensing
of
engineers,
of
mechanical
engineers,
or
whatever
kind
of
an
engineer
makes
a
drawing
of
a
hull,
i
don't
know.
nautical
engineer,
whatever
it
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
it
prevents,
it
prevents
somebody
from,
from
taking
to
his
friend,
charlie,
who
happens
to
be
very
good
at
draftsmanship,
this
hull
and
say,
charlie,
do
me
a
hull.
you
can't
do
that.
that
warner
of
reproducing
it
is
prohibited
by
the
state.
you
have
to
take
it
to
a,
a,
a
licensed
engineer.
now,
why
doesn't
that
limit
the
warner
of
reproduction?
and
it's
an
area
that
doesn't
involve
health
or
safety.
justice
antonin
scalia
neither
does
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
neither
does
this.
the
shape
of
the
hull
is
not
withdrawn
from
the
public
domain.
what's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
in
the
case
i
gave
you,
making
it
through
this...
through
charlie
os
withdrawn.
justice
antonin
scalia
xxx
as
you
say
that
the
patent
law
does
address
manner
of
reproduction.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
don't
see
that
it
addresses
that.
it
addresses
whether
people
are
allowed
to
reproduced
it
doesn't
specifically
say,
by
every
possible
means
and
the
state
can't
exclude
any,
because
you
acknowledge
the
state
can
exclude
some.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
more
than
just
that
it
isn't
a
total
prohibition.
i
mean,
that's
not
very
satisfying.
you
can
do
anything
so
long
as
it's
a
total
prohibition.
isn't
there
something
different
about
this
kind
of
prohibition,
that
it's
a
prohibition
that
relates
to
the
physical
hull,
to
what
you
can
do
with
the
physical
hull?
not
with
the
drawings,
not
with
the
ideas,
not
with
the
invention,
but
what
you
can
do
with
an
identifiable
physical
hull,
just
as
what
was,
in
sears,
in
your,
your
example,
what
you
could
do
with
the
physical
lamp.
