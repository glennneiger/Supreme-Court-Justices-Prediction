mr.
charles
e.
lipsey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
refocus
the
court's
attention
for
a
moment
on
five
basic
principles
which
i
think
are
fundamentally
undisputed
and
which
i
think
govern
the
outcome
of
this
case.
the
first
is
that
the
federal
patent
law
seeks
to
strike
a
balance
between
incentives
for
innovation
and
preservation
of
competition.
the
second
point
is
that
the
patentability
standards
which
congress
has
adopted
to
effect
that
policy
reflect
not
only
what
congress
wished
to
be
protectable
but
also
that
which
congress
wished
to
remain
in
the
public
domain.
the
third
point,
where
there's
no
dispute,
is
that
the
boat
design
and
the
boat
manufacturing
process
involved
in
this
case
are
both
squarely
within
the
technological
subject
matter
covered
by
the
patent
law,
addressed
by
the
patent
law,
but
equally
clearly
fail
to
meet
the
patentability
standards
which
congress
has
prescribed.
they
are
in
the
public
domain
because
the
boat
proprietor
here
chose
not
to
avail
itself
of
the
protections
afforded
by
the
patent
law.
the
fourth
point
which
i
think
is
not
in
dispute
is
that
had
a
patent
issued
on
the
boat
itself,
among
the
rights
which
would
have
been
conveyed
to
the
proprietor
would
have
been
the
right
to
exclude
others
from
making
that
boat
by
any
technique,
including
making
that
boat
by
the
direct
molding
technique.
in
fact,
had
a
product...
had
a
patent
issued
on
the
process
of
making
the
boat,
that
would
have
directly
prohibited
others
from
manufacturing
the
boat
by
the
direct
molding
technique.
and
the
last
point,
which
i
think...
is
not
in
dispute,
is
that
the
florida
statute,
for
the
purpose
of
striking
a
balance
between
incentive
for
innovation
and
competition,
has
chosen
to
give
to
this
boat
manufacturer
a
right
to
exclude
others
from
making
his
boat
by
the
direct
molding
process
under
circumstances
where
the
federal
patent
law
would
have
denied
that
right.
and
when
one
analyzes
that
scenario
under
applicable
authority
of
this
court
in
the
federal
preemption
area,
one
is
led
to
the
conclusion
that
the
florida
statute
interferes
with
attainment
of
the
full
objectives
of
the
federal
patent
law.
why?
because
it
strikes
the
balance
in
a
different
place
than
congress
would
have
struck
it.
mr.
charles
e.
lipsey
absolutely,
your
honor.
the
trilogy
of
cases
upon
which
the
petitioner
relies
really
don't
address
the
area
addressed
by
the
patent
law.
the
patent
law
deals
with
the
rights
of
the
public
and
the
rights
of
inventor...
the
inventor
to
use
things
which
are
publicly
known.
it
doesn't
purport
to
address
contractual
obligations
of
confidence
or
rights
of
privacy
from
industrial
espionage
addressed
by
the
trade
secret
law.
the
subject
of
the
trade
secret
law
by
definition
is
not
in
the
public
domain.
just
to
mention
the
goldstein
case
while
we're
on
it,
that
case...
the
whole
ratio
desidende
of
that
case
was
that
the
area
addressed
by
the
state
of
california
was
one
left
wholly
untouched
by
the
federal
government
and
the
copyright
law.
the
federal
copyright
law
simply
didn't
deal
with
sound
recordings
at
that
time,
and
since
there
had
been
no
balance
struck
there
was
no
interference
with
a
federal
balance
by
the
state
choosing
to
act
in
that
area.
now,
they
specifically
distinguished
the
patent
situation
in
the
goldstein
case
where
there
had
been
a
comprehensive
scheme
of
federal
regulation
enacted
that
dealt
with
virtually
everything
under
the
sun.
that's
how
this
court
has
interpreted
the
scope
of
the
patent
law
and
where
the
balance
had
in
fact
been
struck.
mr.
charles
e.
lipsey
well,
your
honor--
mr.
charles
e.
lipsey
--it
wouldn't...
let
me
address--
mr.
charles
e.
lipsey
--let
me
answer
that
by
giving
you
two
hypothetical
situations.
the
first
is...
where
the
house
is
being
built
in
a
secluded
area
surrounded
by
a
fence,
and
the
idea
of
the
house
has
never
been
disclosed
to
anybody
who
has...
who
doesn't
have
an
obligation
of
confidence
to
the
designer,
and
the
photograph
is
taking
by
flying
over
the
fence
for
the
purpose
of
taking
a
photograph.
that
violates
the
law,
but
it
doesn't
violate
the
patent
law.
that's
the
trade
secret
theft,
that's
a
discovery
by
improper
means.
now,
let
me
posit
the
other
scenario,
which
is
the
house
is
built
on
the
corner
of
14th
and
pennsylvania
avenue
out
here,
and
as
it
is
arising
it
is
in
plain
view
of
the
public
and
a
man
takes
a
photograph
of
it,
as
he's
entitled
to
take
a
photograph
of
anything
in
the
public
domain,
and
uses
that.
an
attempt
to
reach...
that,
that
could
not
be
reached
under
the
trade
secret
law,
and
an
attempt
to
limit
his
options
in,
in
copying
something
he's
entitled
to
copy
would
offend
the
principles
of
the
patent
law,
it
would
strike
a
different--
mr.
charles
e.
lipsey
--well,
first
of
all,
let
me
correct
a
misperception.
even
the
patent
law
doesn't
cover
ideas.
ideas,
principles
of
nature,
laws
of
nature,
those
are
things
that
are
in
the
storehouse
of
information
for
all
men
to
use,
they're
not...
they
are
not
articles,
machines,
compositions
of
matter
and
processes
within
the
scope
of
the
patent
law.
it's
only
the
application
of
those
ideas
to
practically
useful
ends
that
the
patent
law
addresses.
but
assuming...
your
question
still
has
validity
notwithstanding
that,
which
i
frankly
have
totally
lost
track
of.
[laughter]
mr.
charles
e.
lipsey
i
must
confess
i've
forgotten
the
question.
i'm
sure--
mr.
charles
e.
lipsey
--the
patent
law
is
concerned
with
what's
in
the
public
domain,
and
that's
a
term
of
art
in
these
cases.
the
public
domain
means
exactly
what
the
words
say.
it
means
it's
an
area
over
which
the
public
has
supreme
title.
now,
just
because
the
public
has
supreme
title
in
an
area,
as
it
does
in
a
public
park,
doesn't
mean
the
public
is
necessarily,
necessarily
entitled
to
use
it.
there's
a
sign
at
the
top
of
a
waterfall
in
yosemite
national
park
that
says,
you
may
not
pass
this,
this
spot.
that
doesn't
withdraw
that
waterfall
from
the
public
domain.
it,
it
remains
in,
in
the
public's
ownership.
and
that
is
not
the
sort
of
action
that
offends
the
patent
law.
but--
mr.
charles
e.
lipsey
--well,
i...
i'm,
i'm
getting
to
that,
which
is
that
where
the,
where
the
state
regulates
the
right
to
use
something
to
prevent...
to
protect
the
health
and
safety
of
its
citizens,
it
doesn't
create
in
that
thing
an
exclusive
right
in
belonging
to
a
private
individual.
it
says,
if
the
sign
at
the
top
of
the
waterfall
said,
you
may
not
go
here
unless
john
doe
says
you
may
come
here,
that
does
remove
that
from
the
public
domain.
and
the
scenario
you
posit,
if
the
state
simply
wants
to
regulate
for
health
and
safety
reasons
how
everybody
can
use--
mr.
charles
e.
lipsey
--there,
there
is
a
law
to
that
effect,
it's
grounded
in
the
law
of--
mr.
charles
e.
lipsey
--that's
the
right
of
publicity,
that's
perhaps--
mr.
charles
e.
lipsey
--not
at
all,
because
those
are
interests
which
are
not
addressed
at
all
in
the
balancing
core
by
congress.
what
they're
concerned
about
is
how
do
i
promote
innovation
on
the
one
hand,
by
giving
property
rights,
and
how
do
i
preserve
competition
on
the
other
by
denying
property
rights
in
things
which
ought
to
be
in
the
public
domain.
that's
all
the
patent
law
deals
with.
mr.
charles
e.
lipsey
your
honor,
i
believe
that's
the
next
case
that
you're
going
to
have
here.
that--
mr.
charles
e.
lipsey
--i
believe
that
that
raises
issues
of
state
contract
law
enforcement.
it
may
raise
questions
under
the
antitrust
law,
and
there
is
a
patent
law
doctrine
which
might
be
implicated,
this
court's
decision
in
lear
v.
atkins,
that
says
when
you
seek
by
contract
to
deny
to
a
member
of
the
public
a
right
which
the
patent
law
demands
he
has
the
court
may
declare
the
provision
of
that
contract
unenforceable
on
policy
grounds.
but
i
don't
believe
it
raises
a
preemption
question.
so,
i'd,
i'd
like
to
deal
briefly
with
the
opposition,
the
arguments
of
the
petitioner
in
opposition
to
the
decision
of
the
florida
supreme
court.
their
main
argument
is,
this
doesn't
take
any
product
out
of
the
public
domain,
it
only
takes
a
process
out
of
the
public
domain.
and
there's
a
double-barreled
answer
to
that.
one
is
the
answer
which
is
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court,
court
of
florida,
and
that
is
that
when
you
undertake,
for
purposes
of
striking
a
balance
between
innovation
and
competition,
to
tamper
with
the
resources
that
are
in
the
public
domain
that
are
available
to
a
man
who's
entitled
to
copy,
you
interfere
indirectly
with
the
right
which
sears
and
compco
says
you
may
not
interfere
with
directly,
and
that
statute,
that
act
ought
also
to
be
preempted.
there's
a
second
and
i
think
equally
powerful
answer
to
that,
which
is
you
ignore
completely
the
notion
that
processes
are
patentable
inventions
too.
the
patent
law
covers
not
just
articles,
it
covers
processes,
compositions
of
matter,
and
machines.
and
when
you
go
to
withdraw
from
the
public
domain
an
unpatented
and
publicly-known
process,
you
offend
the
principles
of
sears
and
compco
just
as
surely
as
you
do
if
you
seek
to
withdraw
an
unpatented
and
publicly-known
article.
mr.
charles
e.
lipsey
absolutely.
that's
a
safety
matter,
a
safety
matter.
and
that
applies
to
everybody.
mr.
charles
e.
lipsey
well--
mr.
charles
e.
lipsey
--well,
your
honor,
i
had
that
trying
to
be
fair.
i
was--
mr.
charles
e.
lipsey
--no,
no.
let
me
answer
that.
the
federal
law
of
supremacy
and
preemption
is
not
a
black
letter,
inflexible
thing,
and
the
interest
which
the
state
is
seeking
to
protect
is
certainly
a
relevant
inquiry
in
making
the
preemption
analysis.
and
i
think
the
authorities
of
this
court
indicate
that
where
the
state
is
acting
in
the
heart
of
its
police
power,
dealing
with
the
health
and
safety
of
its
citizens,
that
greater
deference
is
given
state
action
in
that
area
than
it
might
be
where
the
state
is
acting
in
a
peripheral,
commercial
sort
of
arena.
and
so
that's
why
i
focused
on
that
distinction.
secondly,
differences
in
the
state's
objectives
manifest
themselves
in
differences
in
the
vehicles
adopted
in
the
statute
to
attain
the
goal.
if
you're
interested
in
protecting
health
and
safety,
you
prevent
everybody
from
doing
it.
you
create
no
private
right
to
exclude
others.
but
when
you're
interested
in
balancing
incentive
for
innovation
against
the
right
to
compete,
the
vehicle
one
adopts
is
to
give
an
exclusionary
right
to
the
proprietor,
just
as
the
patent
law
adopts
giving
an
exclusionary
right
to
the
proprietor.
and
so
the
difference
in
objective
of
the
statute
is
reflected
in
adoption
of
a
vehicle
which
directly
collides
with
the
statutory
scheme
in
the
patent
law.
and
that,
that
was
why
i,
i
focused
on
the
difference
in
objective.
mr.
charles
e.
lipsey
creates
no
private
property
right,
your
honor.
it
creates
in
no
citizen
the
right
to
exclude
some
other
citizen
from
using
something
in
the
public
domain.
mr.
charles
e.
lipsey
well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
it
may
limit
the
options
in
reproduction,
but
it
does
so
without
withdrawing
anything
from
the
public
domain.
there's
no
god-given
right
to--
mr.
charles
e.
lipsey
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
charles
e.
lipsey
but
the
process
of
making
it
is,
and
the
process
of--
mr.
charles
e.
lipsey
--well,
your...
we
are
disagreeing
on
the
difference
between
a
technological
technique,
which
is
the
subject
of
the
patent
law,
and
a
method
of
doing
business,
such
as
whether
you'd
use
a
licensed
engineer
or
an
unlicensed
engineer,
which
the
patent
law
doesn't
even
address.
and
if
we're
talking
about
preemption
by
the
patent
law,
only
the
former
situation
is
preempted
and
the
latter
is
not.
mr.
charles
e.
lipsey
no,
i--
mr.
charles
e.
lipsey
--your
honor,
the
patent
law
deals
with
technology,
with
the
skill
and
art
by
which
things
happen
in
this
country,
by
which
things
are
changed
into
other
things,
with
science.
it
doesn't
purport
to
deal
with
licensing
techniques,
with
safety
concerns,
with
any
of
these
other
matters
cited
in
the
cases
in
the
petitioner's
brief.
and,
and
so
the
preemption
issue
is
a
narrow
one.
is
the
state
creating
a
property
right,
a
right
to
exclude
others,
in
technology
of
the
sort
which
the
patent
law
deals
with
and
says
should
be
free.
and
i,
i
think
we've
established
pretty
clearly
that
it
does
in
this
case.
i'd
like
to
just
mention
that
this
argument
that
it's
police
power,
it's
police
power,
is
kind
of
a
recoherring.
even
if
you
concede
that
it
is
within
the
police
power
of
the
state,
all
that
does
is
establish
the
right
of
the
state
to
act
absent
the
patent
law.
it
begs
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it's
an
exercise
of
police
power,
which
is
nonetheless
preempted
because
it
clashes
with
the
objectives
of
the
federal
patent
law.
mr.
charles
e.
lipsey
there
is
that
language,
but
the
same
argument
that
it's
police
power,
it's
police
power,
could
have
been
made
in
sears-compco
as
well.
and,
and
so
obviously
there
are
some
police
powers
which
are
not
preempted
and
there
are
some
which
may
be
exercised
in
a
way
which
is
preempted.
and
let
me
give
you
an
example.
suppose
the
state
of
florida
wanted
to
promote
innovation
in
boat
hull
design,
but
did
so
by
granting
tax
credits
for
investments
made
in
manufacture
of
an
original
boat
hull.
they
achieved
the
same
goal,
but
they
do
so
without
withdrawing
anything
from
the
public
domain,
without
giving
to
the
proprietor
a
right
to
exclude
others
from
using
technology
that's
already
out
there.
that
would
not
have
been
preempted.
but
the
vehicle
they've
chosen
to
effect
this
policy
happens
to
be
preempted.
i'd
like
to
mention
briefly
the
interpart
opinion
of
the
federal
circuit,
which
is
cited
and
relied
upon
heavily
by
the
petitioner.
as
with
any
lower
court
authority,
i
think
its
value
here
is
only
for
the
thoroughness
and
logic
of
its
analysis.
the
interpart
opinion
didn't
deal
at
all
with
the
flip
side
of
the
federal
patent
law
coin,
which
is
this
policy
of
protecting
competition
in
things
that
are
in
the
public
domain.
it
did
not
deal
at
all
with
the
process
patent
aspects
of
the
right,
which
is
given
by
the
state
of
florida,
and
it's
wholly
unsatisfying
sort
of
analysis,
and
i
don't
think
that
it
really
alters
the
analysis
in
this
court
at
all.
finally,
i
would
like
to
address
the
point
they
make,
they
reap
where
they
do
not
sow,
it's
unfair,
and
there
caught
to
be
a
law.
as
the
questions
of
mr.
russell
pointed
out,
the
question
of
whether
it's
unfair
is
something
we
have
to
analyze
in
light
of
what
the
law
permits,
what
the
patent
law
permits.
and
in
1938
this
court
decided
the
kellogg
case
and
said,
it's
not
unfair
to
use
something
that
the
patent
law
leaves
in
the
public
domain.
and
that
was
the
essence
of
the
sears
and
compco
holdings
in
1964.
and
it's
apparently
time
to
say
that
again.
secondly,
they're
really
not
reaping
where
they
do
not
sow,
to
carry
the
agricultural
analogy
further
they
are
gathering
what
nature
leaves
in
the
public
domain.
it
is
in
the
very
nature
of
technological
processes
that
once
they
are
publicly
disclosed
they
force
themselves
into
the
possession
of
everybody
who
learns
of
them.
and
that
person
can
be
dispossessed
of
the
right
to
use
them
only
by
the
issuance
of
a
valid
patent.
and
finally,
when
they
say
there
ought
to
be
a
law,
there
is
a
law.
there's
the
federal
patent
law,
there's
the
federal
design
patent
law.
it
provides
protection
in
this
area.
they
should
use
it.
if
it's
inadequate
they
should
go
to
congress
and
ask
them
to
change
it,
or
to
modify
it,
or
embellish
it.
and
in
fact
requests
have
been
before
congress
for
years
to
modify
the
patent
law
in
the
area
of
industrial
designs
and
to
allow
some
more
limited,
easier
to
obtain
protection.
that's
where
the
debate
is.
i
think
that's
where
it
ought
to
stay.
the
dispute
is
much
broader
than
just
boat
hulls
in
florida.
there
are
12
statutes
dealing
with
this
sort
of
thing.
three
of
them
deal
with
every
manufactured
article
that
there
is,
not
just
boat
hulls.
one
of
those
statutes
is
being
used
to
try
to
stifle
competition
in
the
automobiles
aftermarket
for
crash
part.
the
economic
stakes
are
immerse.
the
divergent
interests
are
immense
and
of
national
scope.
and
it's
the
sort
of
thing
which
really
is
peculiarly
within
the
ken
of
congress,
and
i
would
urge
the
court
to
leave
it
there.
thank
you
very
much.
