justice
john
paul
stevens
excuse
me,
mr.
russell,
would
it
not
result
in
affirmance
if
we
bought
the
argument?
can't
we
affirm
on
a
ground
not
argued
below?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
we
could
consider
the
copyright
issue
if
we
decided
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
russell,
maybe
this
is
the
same
question,
but
may
i
just
phrase
it
a
little
differently.
would
you
contend
that
this
statute
would
apply
even
to
the
boat
hull
after
a
patent
had
been
issued
and
expired,
something
that
had
been
previously
covered
by
an
expired
patent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
clearly
would
give--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but,
but
the
statute
would
apply
even
if
a
patent
had
issued
and
expired,
so
there
would
be,
as
justice
o'connor
says,
a
state
law
grant
in
perpetuity
of
something
that
the
federal
patent
had
covered?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
would
clearly
be
an
infringement
if
the
patent
had
been
in
effect
at
the
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
russell,
may
i
ask,
you
refer
to
his
unfair
competition.
if
there
were
no
florida
statute
would
it
be
unfair
competition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
think
that
even
without
the...
you
don't
need
the
florida
statute
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
it's
just
clarifying
a
law,
a
rule
that
existed
independently
of
the
florida
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
know
that's
possible,
but
is
that
your
position
in
this
case?
that
really,
as
a
matter
of
unfair
competition,
common
law,
you
could
have
enjoined
this,
this--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
real
point
of
my
question
is,
when
you
characterize
it
as
unfair
competition,
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
the
issue.
it's,
it's
unfair
competition
by
reason
of
the
statute
and
whether,
whether
you
can
pass
a
statute
that
makes
something
unfair
competition
that
otherwise
would
be
preempted
by
the
policies
under
the
patent
laws.
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
the
state
provide
that,
that
they
could
charge
a
royalty
for,
for
using
the
molding
process?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
provides
it
without
the
written
permission
of
the
other
party,
and
i
suppose
you
could
say
i'll
give
you
written
permission
provided
you
pay
me
$100
a
boat.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
think
that
would
be
proper?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
this
is
the
license
of
something
that's
in
the
public
domain.
justice
john
paul
stevens
something
that
the
copier
has
purchased
and
owns
himself,
i
suppose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
question...
i
remember
the
question.
the
question
was,
say
the
house
is
down
here
or
14th
and
pennsylvania.
can
the
governing
jurisdiction
pass
a
law
saying
you
cannot
take
a
picture
of
that
house
and
use
it
for
commercial
purposes
without
the
permission
of
the
owner?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no.
let's
say
the
purpose
of
the
regulation
is
for
economic,
just
for
economic
purposes.
say
instead
of
a
house
you
take
your
picture
and
i
want
to
use
it
in
my
ads
for
new
suits
or
something
like
that,
as
a,
as
a
handsome...
would
you
be
entitled
to,
and
say
the
state
law
provided
that
you
can't
take
somebody's
picture
and
use
it
for
commercial
purposes
without
compensating
that
individual.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
law
of
privacy
inconsistent
with
the
policies
of
the
patent
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
if
this
boatmaker
had
a
provision
in
his
regular
sales
contract
that
required
the
purchaser
to
agree
not
to
copy
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
we
decide
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
russell,
can
i
go
back
for
a
second
to
the
sears
case?
that
was...
sears
copied
the
stiffel
lamp,
was
that
right?
how
did
they
make
the
copies
there?
does
the
record
tell
us?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
the
record
told
us
that
they
did
it
by
a
molding
process
or
something
like,
that
they...
i
don't
know
how...
how
you'd
copy
a
lamp,
but
could
illinois
have
forbidden
that
one
method
of
copying
but
lets
that
any
other
method
is
okay?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
that...
the
only
thing
wrong
there
was
the
total
prohibition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
you
have
a
statute
saying,
you
cannot
use
the
physical
lamp
when
you're
trying
to
make
a
copy
of
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
russell,
let
me
ask
one
other
question
i
meant
to
ask
earlier.
would
it
violate
the
florida
statute
to
take
the
boat
to
georgia
and
do
the
copying
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
assuming
it
does
not
have
such
a
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
so
it
just...
it
only
applies
in-state--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i'm
assuming
he
did
all
the
copying
in
georgia.
so
they
caught
him
in
florida--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
you
would
say
if
the
statute
would
cover
out-of-state
copying--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
see.
