justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
some
other
state
might
just
prevent
copying
by
another
manner,
just
the
single...
it
picks
out
some
other
way
of
copying
and
says
we
are
preventing
copying
only
in
this
way.
and,
and,
and
another
state
might,
might
permit
copying
in
another
specific
way.
and
each
one
of
those
states
would
be
quite
proper,
in
your
view.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
you
flatter
me,
that's
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
sears
old
say
that,
that,
that
absent
a
patent
there
was
a
public
right
to
copy
in
every
detail.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
florida
says,
you
can't
copy
it
in
the
following
ways,
and
they
list
six,
but
there's
still
another
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
prohibition
applies
to
something
that
a
copier
owns.
i
mean,
he
bought
the
hull.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
his
hull.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
state
says,
awfully
sorry,
but
you
can't
make
a
mold
of
your
hull.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
cannot
use
your
hull,
you
cannot
use
your
hull,
reproduce
it
in
that
way
for
commercial
purposes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he,
he...
he's
marketed
it.
he's
getting
everything
out
of
it
he
thought
he
was
getting.
justice
byron
r.
white
well--
justice
byron
r.
white
--that's,
that's
the
problem
with
everybody
who
doesn't
have
a
patent.
that's
the
risk
you
take,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
caught
the
georgia
copier
in
florida,
they
could
get
an
injunction
against
him.
