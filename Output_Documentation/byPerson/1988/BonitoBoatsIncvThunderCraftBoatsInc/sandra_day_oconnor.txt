justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
russell,
may
i
inquire
preliminarily
whether
your
client
could
have
obtained
a
patent
for
its
boat
hull?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
your
client
chose
not
to
try
to
obtain
a
patent
for
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
the
boat
hull
have
been
registered
as
a
sculptural
work?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
thing
that's
curious,
if
the
thing...
if
the
boat
hull
was
patentable,
it
is
curious
that
if
the
florida
statute
is
valid
it
would
in
effect
grant
a,
a
right
in
perpetuity
that
under
the
patent
law
would
be
limited.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
just
struck
me
that
if
this
boat
hull
could
have
been
patented
and
wasn't,
but
the
owners
of
it
want
to
be
protected
under
florida's
special
law,
florida's
law
would
give
them
a
right
in
perpetuity
that
the
patent
law
would
give
only
for
a
limited
period
of
time.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
lipsey,
do
you
acknowledge
that
there
is
some
room
still
for
state
laws
to
protect
trade
secrets
and
to
do
other
similar
things
for
protection?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
third
opinion
for
announcement
by
me
today
is
bonito
boats,
inc.
verus
thunder
craft
boats,
inc.
number
87-1346
and
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
in
1976,
petitioner
bonito
boats
a
florida
corporation
developed
and
marketed
a
boat
hull
design
which
enjoyed
great
commercial
success.
the
petitioner
did
not
seek
federal
patent
protection
for
the
design
or
for
the
utilitarian
aspects
of
the
boat
hull
or
for
the
process
by
which
the
boats
were
produced.
in
1983,
after
the
hull
design
had
been
on
sale
for
some
six
years,
the
florida
legislator
passed
a
statute
making
it
unlawful
to
use
the
direct
molding
process
to
duplicate
any
manufactured
boat
hull
or
the
component
parts
of
it
without
permission
of
the
original
manufacturer.
shortly
after
the
enactment
of
the
florida
law,
the
petitioner
brought
suit
against
the
thunder
craft
boats,
a
tennessee
corporation,
for
duplicating
petitioner's
boat
hulls
in
violation
of
the
florida
statute.
the
petitioner
sought
damages,
injunctive
relief
and
attorney's
fees
for
the
illegal
copying.
the
florida
trial
court
dismissed
the
complaint.
the
florida
court
of
appeals
and
the
supreme
court
of
florida
affirmed
the
dismissal
finding
that
the
florida
statute
impermissibly
interfered
with
the
public
use
of
unpatented
designs.
we
then
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
a
conflict
between
the
judgment
of
the
florida
courts
and
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
holding
that
a
similar
california
law
did
not
conflict
with
the
federal
patent
scheme.
in
a
unanimous
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
florida
supreme
court.
the
florida
statute
creates
patent
like
rights
in
design
and
utilitarian
concepts
which
are
left
unprotected
by
the
federal
patent
law.
the
statute
thus,
conflicts
with
the
strong
federal
policy
embodied
in
the
patent
laws
that
unpatented
items,
in
general
circulation
are
the
tools
of
creation
itself,
free
for
all
members
of
the
public
to
exploit.
the
substantial
protection
against
duplication
offered
by
the
florida
law
could
divert
inventive
effort
away
from
the
requirements
of
patentability
established
by
congress
over
the
last
200
years.
we
hold
then
that
the
florida
law
is
pre-empted
by
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
federal
constitution.
