well,
then,
what's
the
point
of
the
florida
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
there
are
other
methods
that
are
easier,
then
what
purpose
does
the
statute
serve?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
if
you're
telling
us
there
are
a
lot
of
other
ways
that
are
easier,
then
i
just
don't
see
what
purpose
the
statute
has
at
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose,
suppose
that
someone
took
borito's
hull
and
they
copied
it
by
reverse
engineering,
not
by
molding?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
then

all
right,
wait
a
minute--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--then
someone
else
takes
that
and
copies
it
by
directing
molding.
violation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
there's
no,
there's
no...
it's
clearly
not
patentable.
