well,
mr.
graetz,
what
flexibility
does
the
irs
have
to
change
its
view
in
its
regulations
from
time
to
time?
and
doesn't
it
do
so
in
other
instances?
and
has
this
court
ever
taken
the
view
that
it
can't
change
its
mind?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
graetz,
even
if
we
accent
your
approach
to
the
deductibility
for
auditing,
what
about
training?
and
why
isn't
that
like
tuition
and
non-deductible?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
tuition
isn't
deductible,
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
should
it
be,
why
should
payments
be
deductible
for
training?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
concede
there
may
be
a
basis
for
making
that
distinction?
