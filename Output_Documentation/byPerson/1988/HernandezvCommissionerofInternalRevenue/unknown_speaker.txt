unknown
speaker
among
others,
among
others.
that's
not
the
purpose
of--
unknown
speaker
--all
these
other
services
that
you've
mentioned,
i
think
it's
the
case,
all
these
other
worships
would
have
occurred
whether
the
individual
had
paid
or
not.
the
high
holy
service
would
have
gone
ahead
whether,
whether
a
particular
individual
bought
a
ticket
for
it,
the
mass
would
have
been
said
whether
or
not
somebody
paid
to
have
a
particular
person
remembered
at
the
mass.
it
seems
to
me
this
is
different
in
the
sense
that,
the
only
equivalent
i
can
think
of
in,
in
my
religion
at
least
is,
is
charging
a
fixed
fee
for
confession.
there,
there
is
something
that
would
not
happen
but
for
the
fact
that
you
paid
the
money
to
get
it.
and
i
think
that,
that
is
different
from--
--how
about
mormon
tithing
to
enter
the
mormon
temple?
unknown
speaker
but
the
temple
service
happens
anyway,
whether
a
particular
individual
tithes--
unknown
speaker
--well,
why
don't
you
think
the
internal
revenue
code
permits
it?
certainly
a
lot
of
very
intricate
factual
inquiries
are
made
under
the
code,
not
always
with
statutory
support.
unknown
speaker
mr.
graetz,
straighten
me
out
on
one
thing.
you
have
a
stipulation
to
most
of
the
facts
in
this
case,
do
you
not?
unknown
speaker
is
there
an
independent
proceeding
having
to
do
with
the
qualification
of
the
church
under
501(c)(3)?
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
the
status
of
that?
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
tax
court
opinion?
unknown
speaker
to
other
scientology
churches?
unknown
speaker
so
you're
distinguishing
among
them?
unknown
speaker
mr.
merrill,
this
has
a
little
bit
of
an
other-worldly
quality
about,
it,
this
case,
in
light
of
the
9th
circuit's
holding,
that
the
church
in
california
is
not
a
tax-exempt
organization.
whey
then
does
the
government
stipulate
here
that
it
is?
unknown
speaker
is
the
government
not
challenging
the
tax-exempt
status
of
the
church
in
other
states?
unknown
speaker
well,
did
it
turn
essentially
on
these
same
things,
the
marketing
and
advertising
and
fixed
fees
and
so
forth?
unknown
speaker
but
you're
stuck
with
the
stipulation
here.
unknown
speaker
mr.
merril,
do
you--
--but
all
of
your
troubles
would
have
been
gone
had
you
been
able
to
follow
the
california
case.
unknown
speaker
but
are
these
churches
so
different?
after
all,
there
are
various
lutherans
synods,
too.
and--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
also
agree
that
the
synagogue
sell
their
seats
on
high
holy
days
and
the
catholic
churches
sell
their
seats
at
a
fixed
price?
i
emphasize
fixed
price.
unknown
speaker
do
you
admit
that?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
you
don't
know?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
know?
is
that
the
reason?
or
are
you
refusing
to
admit
something
that
you
know?
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
put
it
specifically.
does
irs
grant
relief
to
the
people
that
buy
seats
in
the
synagogues
and
the
catholic
churches?
unknown
speaker
sir?
unknown
speaker
you
know,
it's
really
possible
that
some
of
us
do
know.
mr.
merrill,
would
you
at
least
agree
that
if
your
position
is
correct,
that
some
deductions
for
other
religious
practices
and
payments
might
be
called
into
question?
unknown
speaker
such
as
mormon
tithing
and
some
of
the
other
things
that
go
on.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
would
you
at
least
concede
that
those
practices
then
would
be
open
to
question
for
their
deductibility?
unknown
speaker
it
is
difficult,
isn't
it,
to
place
a
value
on
religious
worship--
unknown
speaker
--in
the
quid
pro
quo
context?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you
can
say
that
also
in
response
to
a
10
percent
tithing
requirement
or
membership
requirement
of
any
kind.
you
can
say
the
parties
have
placed
a
value
on
it.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
merrill,
it
has
the
very
precise
quid
pro
quo.
for
the
tithe
you
get
to
be
a
member
of
the
church.
why
isn't
that
precisely
the
kind
of
quid
pro
quo
that
would
make
it
non-deductible
under
your
reasoning?
unknown
speaker
whatever,
whatever
appertains
to
membership
in
the
church
is
precisely
what
you
get
for
your
tithe.
you
don't
get
anything
else.
i
don't
understand
your
argument.
it
seems
to
me
you
made
a
rather
extreme
concession.
unknown
speaker
i
just
simply
don't
understand
that.
i
think
a
member
of
whatever
the
organization
is,
a
member
has
certain
privileges
as
a
result
of
being
a
member.
he's
eligible
for
certain
offices,
he
can
do
certain
things
that
he
cannot
do
if
he's
not
a
member.
what...
otherwise
why
would
anyone
want
to
be
a
member?
if
you
have
to...
you
can
be
a
member
of
the
catholic
church
or
most
churches
without
paying
anything.
you
just
walk
in
the
front
door
and
start
attending
services.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
can't
get
in
the
temple
without
paying
the
mormon
tithing,
then
that
would
be
enough
certainly,
and
i'm
sure
that
that's
the
condition,
to
be
a
mormon
in
good
standing,
and
therefore
to
be
able
to
gain
admittance
to
the
temple.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
there
is
at
least
one,
one
thing
other
than
just
honorific
membership,
other
than
just
status
that
comes
from
a
mormon
tithe,
and
that
is
admission...
being
able
to
get
admitted
to
the
temple.
unknown
speaker
so
tithes,
tithes
may
well
be
out.
it's
too
bad,
they've
been
around
a
long
time.
unknown
speaker
longer
than
pew
rents
even.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
controlling
principle
that,
that
means
these
particular
contributions
or
payments
are
not
deductible
but
others
on
the
other
side
are?
it
isn't
just
the
fixed
amount,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
an
earthly
consideration,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
it
has
to
be
observable
and
measurable.
so
you
could
still
sell
indulgences
then,
right,
if
you
get
an
indulgence
at--
unknown
speaker
--a
hundred
dollars
a
shot,
it's
not
observable
or
measurable;
that
would
not
be
a
quid
pro
quo.
unknown
speaker
don't
you
feel
uncomfortable
drawing
these
lines
in
the
supernatural
area?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
the
say
well
be
controlled
by
the
kind
of
test
we
apply,
and
i'm
not
sure
your
test
doesn't
clearly
apply
to
the
practice
of
the
selling
tickets
for
high
holy
days,
if
that's...
in
the
temple,
as
described
at
least
in
the
other
brief.
maybe
it
should,
i
don't
know.
but
it's--
unknown
speaker
--well,
would
any
of
those
facts
make
any
difference
under
your
view
of
the
law?
unknown
speaker
they
might
or
they
would?
i
mean,
what
difference
does
it
make
if
you
get
a
particular
seat
or
just
get
in
the
temple?
unknown
speaker
in
either
event
you
had
to
pay
to
get
the
particular--
unknown
speaker
--isn't
there
also
a
quid
pro
quo,
a
payment
to
get
inside
the
temple,
if
they
won't
let
you
in
otherwise?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
merrill,
i
think
they're
really
just
arguing
that
the
irs
has
interpreted
it
that
way
for
religious
services
all
these
years.
unknown
speaker
and
they're
saying,
why
don't...
why
should
we
follow
a
different
rule
here?
and
i
think
you
have
to
concede
that
certainly
the
irs
ruling
back
in
1919
and
subsequent
practice
lends
some
credence
to
that
argument.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
we'd
feel
more
comfortable
if
you
had
gone
after
some
churches
and
synagogues.
unknown
speaker
mr.
merrill--
unknown
speaker
--when
was
this
point
first
raised
in
this
particular
area?
unknown
speaker
about
these
synagogues
and
roman
catholic
churches
selling
seats.
that
was
raised
in
the
beginning
of
this
case,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
about
how
many
years
ago
was
it?
unknown
speaker
how
long
ago
was
that?
because
my
second
answer's
going
to
be,
what
have
you
done
about
it?
unknown
speaker
outside
of
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
has
the
internal
revenue
done
about
it,
the
service?
unknown
speaker
neither
at
these
cases
came
tram
the
sixth
circuit,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
so
why
are
you
quoting
a
judge
in
the
sixth?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
you
are
saying
that
all
the
scientology
churches
are
alike.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock
