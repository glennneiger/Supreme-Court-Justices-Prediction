justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
to
comment
on
the
government's
response
to,
say,
the,
your
analogy
to
the
tags
stipends
that,
in
that
case
and
in
some
of
the
others
that
you've
mentioned,
the
quo,
what
is
received
in
exchange
is
not
merely
received
by
the
person
who
donates
the
money
or
contributes
the
money
but
is
received
by
the
congregation
at
large.
whereas
in
your
situation,
as
i
understand
it,
the
entire
benefit
from
the
contribution
is
by
the
person
making
the
contribution.
is
that
a
valid
distinction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
the
point.
that's
the
difference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
no,
but
there
is
a
difference
between
making
a
donation
that
benefits
a
large
group
of
people
on
the
one
hand,
if
you
benefit
an
entire
congregation,
and
making
a
donation
that
just...
you
get
the
sole
immediate
benefit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
follow
up
with
one
other
question
i'm
unclear
about.
does
this
church
have
physical
buildings
at
which
congregations
attend
church
in
large
groups?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
the
group
meetings
attended
by
just
the
general
members
of
the
church,
or
the
executives,
or
the
hierarchy,
or
what
are
the
nature
of
the
group
meetings?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
it
tell
us
whether
they
have
any
church
buildings?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
call
them
churches?
