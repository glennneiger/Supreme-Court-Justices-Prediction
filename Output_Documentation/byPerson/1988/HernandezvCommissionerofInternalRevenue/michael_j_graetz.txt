mr.
michael
j.
graetz
chief
justice
rehnquist,
may
it
please
the
court:
although
i
appear
here
today
on
behalf
of
taxpayers
in
these
cases,
my
position
is
quite
unusual.
my
purpose
is
to
convince
you
to
endorse
the
interpretation
of
section
170
of
the
internal
revenue
code
first
announced
by
the
irs
in
1919
and,
with
the
exception
of
this
litigation,
maintained
consistently
by
the
irs
since
that
time,
at
least
through
september
22nd
of
this
year,
when
irs
assistant
commissioner
brower
restated
what
he
described
as
the
cumulative
irs
position
in
these
terms.
and
i
quote,
"religious
observances
generally
are
not
regarded
as
yielding
private
benefits
when
attending
the
observances.
"
"the
primary
beneficiaries
are
viewed
as
being
the
general
public
and
members
of
the
faith.
"
"thus,
payments
for
saying
masses,
pew
rents,
tithes,
and
other
payments
involving
fixed
donations
for
similar
religious
services
are
fully
deductible
contributions.
"
this
case,
your
honor,
involves
fixed
donations
for
religious
services.
and
under
the
position
of
the
irs
for
the
last
70
years,
the
payments
should
be
fully
deductible
contributions.
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
he
did
say
generally,
your
honor.
but
in
the
case
of
making
distinctions
among
religions
for
disallowing
deductions
by
the
participants
and
members
of
that
faith
to
participate
in
religious
observances,
i
think
that
the
irs
and
this
court
should
await
guidance
from
congress
about
what
it
means
to
distinguish
among
religions
on
these
grounds.
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
justice
o'connor,
this
court
has
in
numerous
opinions
expressed
that
in
the
tax
law
there
is
a
need
for
clarity,
particularity,
predictability,
and
special
deference
to
the
irs.
there
are
only
two
cases
in
the
last
decade
that
this
court
has
endorsed
a
change
in
administrative
position
by
the
irs.
the
first
is
the
bob
jones
university
case,
and
in
that
instance
the
majority
of
the
court
found
considerable
evidence
in
the
legislature
that
the
change
in
irs
position
was
one
that
congress
intended
the
irs
to
make.
the
other
instance
was
a
case
involving
interest-free
loans
under
the
gift
tax,
and
the
treatment
of
interest-free
loans
under
the
gift
tax.
and
there
you
had
a
dramatic
change
in
economic
circumstances...
it's
the
dicksan
case,
your
honor.
you
had
a
dramatic
change
in
economic
circumstances
that
made
gift
tax
avoidance
possible
through
the
use
of
interest-free
loans
where
no
such
avoidance
had
been
possible
in
prior
years
until
the
change
in
circumstances.
those
are
the
only
two
instances
that
i'm
aware
of
in
the
last
decade
that
this
court
has
endorsed
such
a
position.
here
the
irs
has
not
expressed
a
change
in
position
through
regulation,
it
has
not
withdrawn
rulings
to
the
contrary,
it
has
not
announced
a
general
principle
for
churches
and
synagogues,
and
their
members
to
follow.
it
in
fact
doesn't
seem
to
have
changed
its
administrative
position,
if,
if
commissioner
brower
is
stating
the
position
correctly.
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
well,
your
honor,
i...
let
me,
let
me
respond
in
two
ways.
one
is,
i
think
that
the
case
law
and
the
precedents
clearly
distinguish
tuition
at
religious
schools,
which
involve
a
secular--
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
--it's
not
deductible.
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
well,
the
court
below
did
not
distinguish
auditing
and
training.
the
stipulations
indicate
that
training
involves
an
educational
component
that
is
not
involved
in
auditing.
however,
the
testimony,
the
uncontradicted
testimony
below,
was
that
training
is
similar
to
the
study
of
sacred
texts,
in
various
other
religions.
and
the
court,
the
tax
court,
which
made
the
factual
findings,
found
that
these
were
payments
for
religious
services
without
distinguishing
the
payments
for
training
and
the
payments
for
auditing,
although
i
think
that
there
may
be
some--
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
--well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
only
basis
that
i,
that
i
can
see
in
the
record
for
making
that
distinction
is
where
the
training
is
undertaken
for
the
purpose
of,
of
becoming
a
minister,
that
is
of
employment.
and
the
taxpayers
in
the
cases
below
did
not
undertake
the
training
for
that
purpose.
they
only
undertook
the
training
for
religious
purposes.
and
in
that
case
i
think
it's
like
sunday
school
that's
normally
included
in
the
dues
of
a
church--
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
--no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
here
the
test
is
one
that
needs
to
be
limited
to
the
conduct
of
religious
worship,
and
in
limited
cases
perhaps,
religious
instruction.
but
i
would
not
go
beyond
that,
and
it
is
really
the
fact
that
the
tax
court
below
did
not
make
any
factual
findings
that
are
different
about
the
two
services,
that
it
clearly
regarded
training
in
these
cases
as
a
form
of
religious
worship,
and
not
a
form
of
religious
education,
or
a
form
of
secular
education
with
religious
components.
the
crucial
issue,
i
think,
below
was
that
the
payments
here
are
fixed
and
mandatory.
and
i
think
that
is
the
basis
of
the
appellate
court's
decisions
that
affirmed
the
tax
court
decision.
and
i
think
that
that
issue
is
one
that
has
been
terribly
confused
in,
in
the
courts
and
in
which
some
clarification
is
necessary.
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
the
finding
of
fact
and
the
stipulations
are
that
with
respect
to
auditing,
there
is
no
educational
component.
with
respect
to
training
there
is
an
educational
component.
and
the
tax
court
found
that
the
taxpayers
had
made
their
payments
to
participate
in
religious
services,
so
that
the
tax
court,
did
not
distinguish
the
educational
component
of
training.
and
these
taxpayers,
the
taxpayers
who
undertook
training
in
this
case,
all
testified
that
they
did
so
as
a
study
of
sacred
text
and
the
expert
witness
who
testified
testified
the
same
things.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
tax
court's
finding
of
fact
in
this
case
is
a
reasonable
finding
of
fact.
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
no,
your
honor,
and
all,
all
that
we
are
asking
is
that,
that
religious
observances,
the
conduct
of
religious
worship,
which
is
a
phrase
that
appears
in
the
internal
revenue
code
regulations
numerous
times,
is
not
the
sort
of
quo...
to
use
the
government's
repetitive
phrase
of
quid
pro
quo...
is
not
the
sort
of
quo
that
will
disqualify
charitable
contribution
deductions.
and
we
do
not
take
the
position
that
education
is
deductible.
there
are
cases,
there's
a
long
line
of
authority
that
says
that
payments
to
a
parochial
school,
or
a
religious
school,
are
non-deductible,
and
i
think
that
would
apply
to
a
divinity
school
as
well.
it
is
here
that
the,
that
the
act
of
studying
the
sacred
text
is
in
fact
an
act
of
worship,
and
it
can
be
an
act
of
worship,
and
the
tax
court
seems
to
have
so
found,
although
its
opinion
here
does
not,
is
not
a
model
of
clarity
on
this
point,
because
it
did
not
distinguish
the
auditing
from
the
training
in,
in
these
cases.
it
is...
it
is
also
important
to
note,
however,
that
in
all
of
the
cases
that
the
government
relies
upon,
that
deductions
have
been
disallowed
in
whole
or
in
part,
and
they
almost
always
are
in
part,
for
payments
in
order
to
participate
in
religious
education.
that...
those
cases,
and
here
i'm
talking
about
oppewal
and
dejong
and
haak
and
the
cases
the
government
cites,
those
cases
involve
voluntary
payments,
not
fixed
payments,
and
not
mandatory
payments.
in
fact,
the
oppewal
case,
which
the
irs
addresses
in
a
revenue
ruling
that
the
government
relies
upon,
in
a
1983
revenue
ruling,
is
described
in
a,
in
a
situation
in
that
ruling,
as
situation
four,
and
in
that
situation
the,
the
person
in
charge
of
the
school
came
and
sat
down
with
each
parent
and
discussed
what
would
be
an
appropriate
contribution.
and
that's
very
similar
to
the
kind
of
fundraising
that
occurs
in
many
churches
throughout
this
country.
and
in
that
case
the
court
said,
the
deduction
is
allowed
only
to
the
extent
that
it
exceeds
the
cost
of
the
education.
now
the
reason
for
that
in
the
internal
revenue
cone
is
clear.
there
you
had
secular
education
that
had
a
religious
component.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
there
are
regulations
under
section
262
that
limit
the
ability
of
people
to
deduct
their
educational
expenses.
and
the
court
was
very
concerned,
and
the
courts
have
been
concerned
in
the
religious
education
context
with
not
permitting
people
to
obtain
deductible
education
when
offered
by
a
church
and
not
be
allowed
to
deduct
it
when
offered
elsewhere.
and
this
court
itself,
in
the
bob
jones
case,
distinguished
religious
education
from
religious
services.
and
we
have
no,
we
have
no
quarrel--
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
--the
arrangement
in
this
case
was
for
a
fixed
sum
to
be
paid,
yes.
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
there
is
a
schedule,
a
schedule
based
on
the
hours
of
worship,
where
the
payment
is
set
by
the
church
and
the
people
who
participate
make
that
payment.
and
it
is
a
fixed
payment.
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
well
again,
your
honor,
i...
the
payments
are
set
on
an
hourly
basis,
and
the
payments
are
fixed.
it
is
our
position
that
the
fact
that
the
payments
are
fixed
and
required
really
cannot
be,
cannot
be
crucial
to
this
case.
it
can't
make
a
difference.
and
i
think
the
distinction
is,
between
auditing
and
training
is
the
one
that
we've
just
discussed,
educational--
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
--well,
your
honor,
there
are
a
number
of
free
services
that
are
given
by
this
church.
the
participation
in
this
religious
service
is
attended
by
a
fixed
price.
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
my
argument
is
that,
that
the
fixed
and
mandatory
nature
of
the
payment
has
never
before
been
held
to
be
crucial
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
charitable
deduction
is
or
is
not
allowable,
that
in
a
case
of
secular
education
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
payment
is
voluntary
or
set
by
the,
set
in
accordance
with
discussions.
all
that
matters
is
the
value
of
the
benefit
on
the
other
side.
and,
in
each
of
the
cases
that
has
been
cited
before
this
case
today,
the
critical
question,
and
it
was
the
question
in
the
american
bar
endowment
case,
is
always,
does
the
amount
of
the
payment
exceed
the
value
of
what
is
received
in
return?
and
if
it
does,
then
it
is
deductible.
and
no
court
has
ever
held
that
the
value
of
religious
worship
is
one
that
can
be
ascertained
by
the
irs
or
by
the
courts.
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
no.
all
i
would
say
is
that
those
kinds
of
fixed
payments
have
been
used
by
churches
throughout
the
ages,
churches
and
synagogues.
there
are
annual
dues
that
are
required
that
are
for
the
year.
mass
stipends
have
been,
have
been
permitted
for
private
masses
on
an
amount
fixed
by
the
church.
jewish
synagogues
charge
a
fixed
fee
for
tickets
to
enter
the
synagogue
on
high
holy
day
services.
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
well,
chief
justice,
the
record
of
the
irs
is
in
dispute.
the
government
claims
that,
that
none
of
these
payments
had
ever
been
passed
upon
by
the
irs.
that's
their
position,
although--
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
--they
certainly
have
been
deducted
and
it
is
very
hard
to
imagine
that,
that
the
participants
of
that
religion
would
nave
never
challenged
in
court
the
disallowance
of
those,
of
those
deductions.
and
the
administrative
record
here,
i
think,
contrary
to
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
is
really
quite
clear.
religion
has
been
distinguished
in
the
law
of
charitable
trusts,
which
this
court
has
recognized
to
be
the
origin
of
the
charitable
deduction
provisions.
it
was,
it
was
made
clear
in
a
1919
ruling
that
the
form
of
contribution,
even
fixed
in
amount,
made
no
difference.
it
was
reaffirmed
in
1970,
immediately
after
the
irs
had
issued
two
rulings
of
significance
in
the
secular
area,
particularly
involving
annual
dues,
where
it
said
that
annual
dues
to
a
secular
membership
organization
are
deductible
only
to
the
excess
of
value,
but
then
two
years
later
issued
a
ruling
that
said,
annual
dues
to
a
church
are
deductible,
period.
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
that's
what
the
ruling
says,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
well,
it,
it
describes
both
of
those
rulings,
the
1919
ruling
and
the
1970
ruling
that
reaffirmed
that
ruling,
describes
certain
fundraising
practices.
they
describe
pew
rents.
well,
by
1970,
pew
rents
had
not
been
a
practice
in
the
protestant
churches,
but
must
refer
to
the
jewish
high
holy
day
ticket.
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
well,
it
had
declined
in
significance.
but,
but
it
was
not
a
significant
form
of
fundraising
in
1970.
it
was
in
1919.
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
well,
it's,
it's
not
a
valid
distinction,
justice
stevens,
because
in
this
religion,
like
all
religions,
it
is,
and
it
is
clearly
in
the
record,
that
this
religion
believes
that,
that
the
proselytization
and
conversion
of
people
to
this
religion
will
serve
mankind,
in
much
the
same
way
that
other
religions
do.
the
only
distinction
is
that
these
religious...
this
form
of
religious
worship
in
this
religion
is
individual
rather
than
congregational.
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
well,
but
your
honor,
the
internal
revenue
code
does
not
distinguish
payments
made
to
religions
based
on
whether
they
worship
individually
or
whether
they
worship
congregationally.
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
well,
but,
let
me
give
you
two
other
examples--
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
--they
have,
they
have
physical
buildings
at
which
there
are
meetings
of,
of
the
members
of
the
faith,
yes.
but
they
don't...
the
congregational
services
are
not
their
core
religious
practice.
their
core
religious
practices
are
individual,
individual
ritualized
religious
practices.
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
well,
there's
not...
in
the
record,
since
these
payments
in
this
case
were
for
the
individualized,
individual
services,
the
record
doesn't
get
into
detail
about
the
nature
at
group
meetings.
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
yes,
there
are
church
buildings.
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
yes,
they
do
call
them
churches.
and
i
guess...
i
really
do
want
to
follow
up
your
first
points
because
i
do
think
it's
crucial
that,
that
we
not
get
into
the
question
of
whether
a
particular
form
of
religious
worship
is
of
relatively
greater
benefit
to
an
individual
or
to
the
congregation.
the
irs,
for
example,
has
approved
tax
deductions
for
an
organization
that
studies
one
family's
genealogy
for
religious
purposes.
now,
the
religion
is
not
identified,
but
apparently
the
practice
described
is
a
common
mormon
practice,
where
family
genealogy
is
very
important
to
the
baptism
of
the
living
and
dead
of
that
family.
and
mass
stipends
are
often,
are
often
said...
masses
are
often
said
for
a
purpose
that
is
specified
by
the
payor
of
the
mass
stipend.
and
i
don't...
there's
nothing
in
the
internal
revenue
code--
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
--well,
but
in
this
case
it's
not
the
exclusive
purpose
either,
justice
scalia.
the
record
is
replete
with,
with
facts
that
suggest
that
as
the
individuals
traverse
the
spiritual
path
of
this
religion,
mankind
is
made
better
off.
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
mormon
tithing...
mormons
must
tithe
in
order
to
enter
the
mormon
temple.
it's
a
requirement;
it's
a
fixed
requirement.
and
i,
i
have
to
say,
your
honor,
the
government--
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
--well,
the
government
suggests
that
the
mass
occurs
anyway.
i
inquired
of
this,
of
catholic
priests,
because
i
couldn't
find
it
in,
in
the
doctrine.
a
catholic
priest
told
me
that
sometimes
masses
are
said
for
special
purposes
that
would
not
otherwise
be
said,
and
that
are
said
in
private,
for
the
benefit
of
a
family
in
connection
with,
with
a
funeral.
now,
it
is
true
that
when
that
mass
is
said
it
is
said
for
the
benefit
of,
of
other
members
of
the
faith
and
all
mankind.
but
that's
true
in
this
case.
and
i
really
don't
think
that,
i
don't
think
the
internal
revenue
code
permits
that
kind
of
inquiry
about
whether
this
religious
service
would
be
performed
or
would
not
be
performed.
i
don't
think
the
constitution
suggests--
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
--well,
your
honor,
there's...
the
legislative
history
doesn't
suggest
that
this
is
appropriate.
the
legislative
history
speaks
of
financial
or
monetary
benefits,
of
monetary
value
received
in
return.
the
language
contribution
was,
had
the
meaning
of
a
levy
or
a
tax
by
ecclesiastical
authority
so
that
there's
nothing
in
the
language
of
the
statute
that
suggests
it.
there's
no
case
that
has
ever
suggested
it,
and
we've
got
70
years
of
administrative
history
to
the
contrary.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
irs
wants
to
start
distinguishing
among
religions
at
this
late
date
in
the
administration
of
this
provision
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
congress
ought
to
tell
them
to
do
that,
congress
ought
to
make
it
known
that
that's
what
they
want
to
do,
and
not
just
the
irs
deciding
which,
which
churches
to
litigate
against.
the
problem
with
the
irs
position
in
this
case
is,
there
is...
they
argue
for
a
fact-bound
determination
without
ever
describing
what
facts,
what
rule
of
law
is
to
apply.
they
distinguish
mass
stipends,
as
justice
scalia
suggests,
on
the
grounds
that
it
would
be
paid
anyway.
they
distinguish
mormon
tithes
on
the
grounds
that
alcohol
is,
is
prohibited.
well,
alcohol
in
this
record
is
prohibited
by
the
scientologists
as
well.
they
distinguish
high
holy
day
tickets
on
the
grounds
that
indigents
are
admitted,
but
you
don't
get
to
deduct
your
payment
to
a
parochial
school
because
it
allows
other
people
who
can't
afford
it
to
come
in
free,
so
that
there
is
no
coherent
basis
in
the
government's
position
for
informing
religions
of,
of
under
what
circumstances
their
payments
will
be
allowed
and
when
they
will
not
be
allowed.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the--
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
yes,
there
is,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
well,
there
is
an
opinion
that
has
denied
the
status
of,
of
the
church
of
scientology
of
california
as
a
tax-exempt
organization.
those...
if
the
church
is
not
tax-exempt,
there
is
no
question
that
there
are
no
payments
deductible
under
section
170.
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
that's,
that's
a
tax
court...
it's
a
tax
court
opinion.
it
was
affirmed
by
the
9th
circuit
on
grounds
of
private
inurement,
and
it
was,
cert
was
denied
in
that
case,
so
that
that,
that
particular
church's
tax
exemption
has
been
repealed.
now
in
this
case
the
petitioners
made
payments
to
other
churches
who
are
recognized
as
tax-exempt
organizations
in
the
current
internal
revenue
code.
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
the,
the
section
501(c)(3)
currently
distinguishes
among
them.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
may
it
please
the
court.
i...
i'd
just
like
to
make
three
points,
if
i
could.
one
is,
your
honor,
that
the
comparison
to
other
religions'
fundraising
practices
appears
in
the
tax
court
testimony
of
the
expert
witness
ant
was
uncontradicted,
and
i
refer
you
to
page
84
of
the
joint
appendix
for
that
testimony.
so
it
was
not
something
that
was
not
in
the
record
below,
and
each
of
the
appellate
courts
that
has
decided
a
case
here
has
recognized
that
there
is
a
threat
to
the
practices
of
other
religions.
secondly,
in
response
to
the
question,
what
is
the
controlling
principle
here
that
the
chief
justice
asked,
what
the
government
is
doing
is
denying
the
existence
of
the
controlling
principle
in
all
other
contexts.
the
controlling
principle
in
all
other
contexts
is
the
relationship
of
the
amount
of
the
payment
to
the
value
of
what
is
received
in
return,
and
the
government
concedes,
apparently,
that
you
can't
value
religious
services.
and
that
was
the
point
that
was
made
by
the
second
circuit,
the
sixth
circuit,
and
the
eighth
circuit
in
finding
for
the
taxpayers
here,
and
without
the
ability
to
value
then
there
is
no
standard
here,
there
is
just
a,
a,
a
selection
of
facts.
and
the
government's
argument
makes
that
absolutely
clear,
and
the
prices
that
are
set
here,
the
tax
court
found,
are
based
on
average
family
income,
and
they're
not
in
any
way
a
measure
of
the
value
of
the
services.
there's
a
footnote
in
the
tax
court
opinion
that
points
cut
that
these
auditing
fees
are
based
on
the
average
family
income
in
the
district.
third,
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
government
has
now
made
it
clear
that
their
problem
here
is
that
it's
just
too
cumbersome
under
the
internal
revenue
code
to
litigate
the
tax
exemption
of
organizations.
and,
and
if
that's
the
problem,
if
that's
why
they've
made
this
dramatic
change
in
their
position,
then
they
should
be
at
congress.
if
there's
a
problem
in
enforcing
the
provisions
of
section
501(c)(3),
then
congress
is
the
appropriate
body
to,
to
address
that
problem.
commercialism,
and
the
role
of
commercialism,
as
an
extremely
complicated
question
under
section
501(c)(3).
the
tax
court
finding
here
in
the
court
below,
on
the
tax
exemption
easier
is
a
unique
finding.
it
was
not
affirmed
on
appeal.
the
court
did
not
reach
that
issue
in
the
ninth
circuit
appeal.
and
as
judge
jones
said
in
the
sixth
circuit,
the
fact
that
the
government
has
stipulated
that
this
is
a
tax-exempt
church
means
under
the
regulations
that
only
an
insubstantial
amount
of
its
function
can
be
devoted
to
a
non-exempt
purpose.
so
that
there
is,
the
stipulation
itself
means
that
commercialism
is
irrelevant
here,
it's
insubstantial
by
definition,
by
stipulation
and
that's
why
judge
jones
said
that
the
finding
of
the
tax
court
that
this
court
operates
in
a
commercial
fashion
is
irrelevant
and
not
controlling.
there
is
no
instance,
there
is
no
instance--
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
--the
cases
that
are
before
this
court
today
are
appeals
tram
the
first
and,
and
ninth
circuit.
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
well,
there
were
identical
cases
in
the
sixth
circuit,
cases
exactly
like
hernandez
there's
a
split
in
the
circuits.
the
first
and
ninth
circuit,
along
with
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
tenth
circuit,
have
found
for
the
government.
the
second,
sixth,
and
eighth
circuits,
on
records
identical
to
the
hernandez
case
here,
nave
found
for
the
taxpayer.
mr.
michael
j.
graetz
your
honor,
i'm
not
saying
that.
in
fact,
there
is,
there
is
an
exemption
certificate,
and
it's
in
the
list
at
cumulative
organizations
that
are
exempt,
for
certain
scientology
churches.
the
church
of
scientology
of
hawaii,
which
is
the
church
to
which
ms.
graham
made
her
payments,
is
tax-exempt.
there
are
other
churches
in
scientology
that
have
held
not
to
be
tax-exempt.
that's
the
way
the
government
should
proceed
with
this
issue.
