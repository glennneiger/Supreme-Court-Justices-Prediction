mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice...
excuse
me.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
before
the
court
today
is
whether
payments
made
by
petitioners
in
order
to
participate
in
auditing
and
training
sessions
sponsored
by
the
church
of
scientology
are
deductible
from
gross
income
as
charitable
contributions
under
section
170
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
the
tax
court,
relying
on
the
same
definition
of
charitable
contribution
that
this
court
subsequently
endorsed
in
the
american
bar...
american
bar
endowment
case,
concluded
that
the
payments
made
by
the
petitioners
were
not
charitable
contributions
but
rather
were
purchases
of
auditing
and
training
services.
we've
heard
a
great
deal
from
mr.
graetz
about
the
facts
that
involve
other
religious
denominations
in
their
fundraising
practices,
but
i
think
it's
appropriate
to
begin
by
stressing
very
briefly
some
of
the
facts
that
the
tax
court
found
in
reaching
that
particular
conclusion.
i
take
these
from
pages
33(a)
to
35(a)
of
the
petition
appendix
in
the
hernandez
case.
first,
the
tax
court
found
that
the
church
of
scientology
charges
a
fixed
fee
for
participation
in
auditing
and
training
sessions.
next,
it
found
that
the
payment
of
these
fees
is
a
prerequisite
of
participation
in
auditing
and
training
sessions,
and
that
with
few
exceptions
these
services
are
never
given
for
free.
in
addition,
the
tax
court
found
that
the
church
had
a
practice
of
offering
discounts
both
for
advance
payment
of
fees
and
for
purchases
of
fees
in
large
quantities.
and
in
addition
the
tax
court
went
on
to
find
that
the
church
has
an,
an
explicit
policy
of
refunding
fees
paid
in
advance
where
a
request
for
a
refund
is
made
before
the
services
are
rendered.
the
court
went
on
to
review
the
extensive
advertising,
marketing,
and
promotional
activities
of
the
church
and
concluded
that
it
operates
in
a
commercial
manner
in
providing
its
religious
services.
specifically,
the
court
concluded
that,
and
this
is
from
page
35(a)
of
the
petition
appendix,
the
goal
of
making
money
permeates
virtually
all
of
the
church
of
scientology's
activities,
its
services,
its
pricing
policies,
its
dissemination
policies,
and
its
management
decisions.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
the
reason
for
the
stipulation--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--i'm
not
familiar
directly
with
the
status
of
the
tax-exempt
condition
of
other
churches
of
scientology
right
now.
i
think
they're
probably
under
administrative
review
by
the
revenue
service.
the
reason
for
the
stipulation
was
an
attempt
to
resolve
these
cases
involving
the
deductibility
in
a
more
expeditious
manner.
the
case
that
counsel
for
petitioners
alluded
to
involving
the
church
of
scientology
of
california
was,
was
a
massive
undertaking
involving
literally
millions
of
documents.
the
trial
life,
i've
been
told,
lasted
for
upwards
at
50
days.
the
tax
court's
opinion
in
that
case
is
144
pages
long,
and
it
took
from
1984
to
1987
for
review
to
be
completed
in
the
9th
circuit.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
one
of
the
issues
in
that
litigation
was
whether
or
not
the
church
of
scientology
operates
for
commercial
as
opposed
to
religious
purposes.
in
order
to
be
a
qualified
religious
organization,
under
section
170(c),
and
under
section
501(c)(3),
the
organization
has
to
operate
exclusively
for
religious
purposes.
and
one
of
the
contentions
that
the
government
race
and
the
tax
court
accepted
was
that
the
churcn
of
scientology
operated
for
commercial
as
opposed
to
exclusively
religious
purposes.
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
that
decision
on
a
different
ground
that
the
church
was
operated
for
the
profit
or
benefit
of
specific
individuals.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
that's
correct,
justice
blackmun.
we
stipulated
in
this
case
that
the
church
of
scientology
is
a
church
under
section
501(c)(3)...
excuse
me,
is
a
religious
organization
under
section
501(c)(3),
is
a
church
under
section
170(b)
and
is
a
qualified
organization
under
section
170(c).
the
only
purpose
of
those
stipulations,
however,
was
to
remove
a
potential
legal
ground
for
denying
these
particular
tax...
these
payments,
tax-deductible
treatment.
those
stipulations
do
not
go
beyond
that
to
negate
any
of
the
other
stipulations
in
the
case
or
any
of
the
findings
of
the
tax
court.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
yes.
if,
if,
the
service
had
a
way
of
resolving
the
tax-deductible
status
of
an
organization
quickly,
simply,
and
expeditiously,
our
troubles
would
have
been
gone.
but
because
that
process
is,
at
least
with
respect
to
this
church,
is
so
time-consuming
and
burdensome,
it
seemed,
at
least
at
the
time
the
stipulations
were
made,
that
it
would
be
quicker
to
stipulate
to
that
particular--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--they're
not
really
that
different.
in
fact,
i
think
there's
testimony
in
the
joint
appendix
to
the
effect
that
they
all
operate
essentially
the
same.
the
problem
is,
i
understand,
that
in
determining
the
tax-exempt
status
of
an
organization
for
170(c)
purposes
or
501(c)(3)
purposes,
the
service
has
to
proceed
organization
by
organization
and
year
by
year,
and
it
can't
render
a,
a
broad-scale
prospective
determination
that
would
apply
to
different,
technically-distinct
organizations
in
future
years
and
resolve
whether
or
not
they
are
eligible
for
tax-exempt
treatment
because
these
organizations
obviously
could
change.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
justice
marshall--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--justice
marshall,
we
don't
admit
anything
about
the
practices
of
churches
that
are
not
involved
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
because
there's
nothing
in
the
record
about
the
actual--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--no.
no,
justice
marshall,
we're
not
refusing
to
admit
something
that
we
know.
what
has
happened
here
is
that
the
petitioners
have
made
a
kind
of
administrative
consistency
argument
which
is
based
not
on
anything
that
the
internal
revenue
service
has
decided,
or
any
reported
decisions,
but
is
based
on
treatises,
articles,
and
secondary
sources
that
describe
the
practices
of
these
other
religions.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
justice
marshall.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record,
and
i
know
nothing
about
the
practice
of
the
revenue
service,
to
know
what
happens
if
somebody
submits
a
claim
that
a
purchase
of
a
high
holy
seat
is--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--i
would
agree--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--well--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--yes.
justice
o'connor,
i
think
the
important
point
is
this,
and
it's
been
obscured
considerably
by
the
petitioners'
presentation.
the
revenue
service
in
this
case,
the
tax
court
in
this
case,
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
first
circuit,
applied
a
well-established
standard
for
determining
whether
or
not
a
payment
is
tax-deductible
that
applies
to
all
types
of
charitable
organizations.
that
standard
is
basically
the
quid
pro
quo
inquiry
asking
whether
or
not
payment
was
made
without
any
expectation
of
a
commensurate
benefit
or
return
consideration.
that
is
the
standard
that
the
service
will
apply
to
any
other
church's
fundraising
practices
in
determining
whether
or
not
they
are
tax-deductible.
if
some
religion
comes
across...
comes
forward
that
in
fact
charges
admission,
as
a
condition
for
attendance
at
its
religious
services,
then
there
would
be
a
significant
risk
that
that
religion
would
also
be
treated
as
not
eligible
for
tax-deductible
contributions.
at
this
point
in
time
that
has
not
happened.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
not,
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
not
in
this
case.
because
the
petitioners
themselves
have
placed
a
value.
they
have
charged
fixed
prices
as
a
prerequisite
for
attendance
at
these
services.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
that's
true,
although
with
respect
to
something
like
mandatory
tithing
what
is
being
offered
there
is
membership
in
a
church,
not
participation
in
discrete
religious
services.
and
i
think
that
would
be
an
important
distinction
that
the
service
would
take
into
account
in
deciding
whether
something
like
a
mandatory
tithing
requirement
was
eligible
for
tax-deductible
treatment.
i
think
that
a,
a
mandatory
fee
or
tithing
requirement
for
membership
in
a
church
doesn't
have
the
same
kind
of
close,
one-on-one
connection,
causal
connection,
between
the
payment
of
the
fee
and
the
provision
of
the
services
that
you
have
in
this
particular
case.
membership
in
the
church
might
entail
the
right
to,
to
participate
in
all
types
of
different
services,
some
of
which
would
be
exercise,
some
of
which
would
not
be.
it
also
would
entail,
i
presume,
significant
obligations.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
well,
the
quid
pro
quo
that
the
service
is
focusing
on
here
is,
is
the
provision
of,
of
specific
services
that
inure
to
the
benefit,
primary
benefit,
of
the
individual
making,
making
the
particular
payment.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
i,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
stevens,
because
again
membership
in
an
organization
does
not
necessarily
involve
some
kind
of
discrete
package
of
benefits
or
services.
it
could.
and
if
it
did
perhaps
you
would
have
a
situation
quite
analogous
to
this
case.
but
the
service
has--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--well,
in
looking
at
membership
dues
and
fees
in
general,
for
all
types
of
charitable
organizations,
as
well
as
religious
organizations,
the
service
has
tended
to
ask
whether
or
not
membership
entails
discernible
concrete
benefits,
privileges
of
admission,
for
example,
to
certain
types
of
activities
that
would
have
a
value.
and
the
service
has
also
said
that
it
membership
simply
has,
simply
confers
a
status
on
an
individual,
a
certain
honorific-type
status
for
example,
that...
in
that
situation
the
benefit,
although
i
will
admit
that
there
technically
is
a
benefit
there,
is
considered
to
be
incidental.
that's
a
legal
conclusion.
and
when
there's
an
incidental
benefit
it's
been
determined
that
that
doesn't
disqualify
the
person
from
deducting
the
membership
dues
as
a
charitable
contribution.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
i'm
not...
i
didn't
follow
the
question.
you're
saying
that--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--if,
as
has
been
suggested,
in
the
sources
the
petition
has
referred
to,
there
is
mandatory
requirement
of
payment
of
tithes
as
a
condition
to
entry
into
the
services,
that
distinguishes
that
case
somewhat
from
the
ordinary
case
of
church
dues.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
well,
tithing--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--again,
tithing
practices
vary
quite
widely
among
religions.
and
even
in
the
mormon
church
we
have
a
situation
that's
considerably
different,
i
think,
from
the
one
presented
by
this
particular
case.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
no.
it's
not
just
the
fixed
amounts
although
that's
a
very
critical
element
in
the
determination.
the
controlling
principle
which
was
cited
by
all
the
lower
courts,
and
is
no
great
mystery
is
that
the
service
asks
whether
or
not
the
payment
is
made
voluntarily
with
the
expectation
of
not
receiving
a
commensurate
benefit
or
consideration
in
return.
and
in
deciding
that
question--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--well,
something
which
is,
which
is
observable
and
measurable,
yes.
something
like
the
right
to
attend
auditing
sessions
and
training
sessions.
and
in
answering
that
question
the
service
looks
at
a
variety
of
facts.
the
tax
court
enumerated
a
number
of
the
facts
that
it
thought
were
particularly
critical
in
reacting
the
conclusion
that
in
fact
that
type
of
quid
pro
quo
arrangement
was
present
here,
rather
than,
rather
than
the
intention
of
making
a
gift.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
i
think
indulgences--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--i
think
we
won't
have
to
face
that
since
indulgences
were
abolished
in
1567,
according
to
the
petitioners'
brief.
but
i
think
indulgences
would
present
a
slightly
different
question
in
this
respect.
the
quid
pro
quo
analysis,
i
take
it,
looks
at
payments
made
to
a
section
170(c)
organization
and
some
benefit
that
is
conferred
in
return
by
the
section
173(c)
organization.
in
this
particular
case
the
fixed
payments
that
are
paid
to
the
church
of
scientology,
and
in
return
the
opportunity
to
attend
auditing
sessions
with
the
auditor
and
the
emir
and
so
forth
or
training
sessions.
in
the
case
of
indulgences,
the
return
consideration
is
not
coming
so
much
from
the
church
as
it's
coming
from
a
non-temporal
realm,
and
in
that
particular...
in
that
type
of
situation
we
think
that
you
might
not
have
the
same
type
of
quid
pro
quo
analysis.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
i
do,
i
do,
justice
scalia.
and
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
decide
all
these
issues
in
this
particular
case.
certainly
none
of
the
lower
courts
have
felt
compelled
to.
and
i
think
that
it's
important
that,
that
the
particular
practices
of
other
religions
that
have
not
been
examined
by
either
the
service
or
the
tax
court
not
be
determined
to
be
either
deductible
or
non-deductible
based
on
"evidence"
from
secondary
sources,
some
of
which
is
quite
obscure
and
quite
outdated.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
we're
not
saying
that
it
would
or
would
not
apply
to
practice
for
high
holy
days.
i
mean,
i
think
that's
an
excellent
example
of
why
it's
important
not
to
prejudge
the
nature
of
religious
practices
without
having
an
actual
record
which
shows
what
they
are.
it
would
be
relevant,
i
think...
the
service
would
want
to
know
whether
or
not
the
purchase
of
high
holy
day
tickets
is
a
prerequisite
of
admission
to
the
service
or
whether
there
is
simply
determined
seating
within
the
service,
whether
or
not
everyone
has
to
have
a
ticket
to
get
in
or
whether
or
not
exceptions
or
made
for
persons
of
reduced
means.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
yes.
they
might.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
well--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--there
is
a
quid
pro
quo
involved
in
the
payment
to
obtain
a
particular
seat.
i
think--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--technically
speaking
there
is.
in
the
1919
revenue
ruling,
in
fact,
the
treasury
stated,
is
very
cryptic,
only
two
short
paragraphs
long.
but
it
stated
very
cryptically
that,
that
from
a
technical
angle
one
could
distinguish
per
rents.
and
i
think
what
was
meant
by
that
was
that
there
was
this
quid
pro
quo
element
that
you
were
paying
for
a
particular
seat.
but
then
they
went
on
to
say
that
they
thought
that
this
benefit
was
conjectural,
that
it
was,
that
whether
or
not
there
was
personal
accommodation
here
was
conjectural,
noted
that
frequently
the
same
type
of
accommodations
made
in
an
informal
basis
to
people
that
give
basket
contributions,
and
decided
that
therefore
that
ordinarily
and
customarily
the
intent
was
probably...
the
real
intent,
was
probably
to
make
a
contribution
rather
than
to
purchase
that
particular
element.
i
think
it's
important
before
getting
drawn
too
far
into
these
discussions
of
other
practices
not
to
lose
the
big
picture
here.
and
i
think
the
big
picture
is
that
the
petitioners
are
arguing
for
a
special
rule,
a
special
exemption
that
would
apply
only
to
one
type
of
purchase
of
services,
religious
services,
and
that
would
in
effect
make
any
purchase
of
religious
services
per
se
deductible.
we
think
that
there
are
a
number
of
very
serious
problems
with
this
approach
to
interpretation
of
section
17c,
and
let
me
try
to
list
those
just
briefly
for
the
court's
consideration.
first,
there's
no
way
to
reconcile
the
petitioners'
proposed
special
rule
with
the
language
of
section
17c.
section
170
establishes
one
standard,
and
only
one
standard,
for
determining
when
a
deductible
charitable
contribution
has
been
made
to
any
type
of
qualifying
charitable
organization,
whether
it's
engaged
in
religious,
charitable,
scientific,
literary,
or
educational
activities.
the
standard
requires
that
in
order
to
be
deductible,
a
payment
must
be
a
contribution
or
gift.
and
what
petitioners
are
proposing,
in
effect,
is
to
read
the
gift
requirement
out
of
the
statute
with
respect
to
one
type
of
services,
religious
services.
second,
the
fact
that
religious
activities
provide
a
subjective
and
intangible
benefit
that
can't
be
directly
valued
doesn't
differentiate
religious
services
from
other
types
of
activities
that
are
offered
by
charities.
poetry
readings,
concerts,
private
exhibitions
of
art,
all
have
a
very
highly
subjective
and
tangible
value
to
the
participant,
and
there
may
be
no
equivalent
service
in
the
marketplace
that
can
be
used
to
fix
a
value
of
these
particular
services.
nevertheless,
it's
well-established
in
the
service's
revenue
rulings
that
when
a
charity
sets
a
fixed
admissions
charge
for
something
like
a
poetry
reading
or
a
private
exhibition,
and
makes
payment
of
that
charge
a
prerequisite
of
attendance,
the
price
of
the
fee
is
presumed
to
be
equal
to
the
value
of
the
services
received
and
hence
is
non-deductible.
third,
the
special
rule
that
petitioners
urge
would
in
our
view
aggravate
rather
than
alleviate
potential
first
amendment
concerns.
under
the
gift
or
contribution
standard
reflected
in
section
170,
the
deductibility
of
a
payment
to
a
church
is
determined
by
a
secular
standard,
whether
there
was
an
intention
to
make
a
gift
rather
than
a
purchase
of
services.
but
under
the
special
rule
that
the
petitioners
are
arguing
in
favor
of,
the
only
possible
inquiry
that
could
be
made
by
the
service
is
whether
or
not
the
church
is
providing
bonafide
religious
services.
the
intrusion
and
entanglement
that
would
be
involved
in
conducting
that
inquiry
would
tar
exceed
anything
that
would
be
presented
by
looking
at
the
external
form
or
structure
of
the
transaction
to
see
it
the
payment
is
a
quid
pro
quo
for
the
provision
of
services.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
that
is
their
primary
argument.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
i'm
afraid
we
don't
concede
that,
justice
o'connor.
it's
a
very
curious
argument.
if
you
look
at
these
revenue
rulings
that
are,
that
are
cited
by
the
petitioners,
you
will
not
see
any
reference
to
the
proposition
that
any
payment
for
the
provision
of
religious
services
is
deductible
automatically,
or
any
equivalent
language.
you
will
not
see
any
reference
to
a
distinction
between
secular
services
and
non-secular
services.
you
will
not
see
any
comment
to
the
effect
that
any
provision
of
religious
services
is
always
incidental
in
the
legal
sense.
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
something
like
the
1919
revenue
ruling,
what
you
will
see
is
that
the
service
was
applying
the
same
standard
that
was
applied
in
this
particular
case.
what
the
service
asked
in
that
particular
case
was
whether
the
real
intent
was
to
contribute
to
the
church
or
to
hire
a
seat
or
a
pew
for
personal
accommodation.
that's
the
same
distinction
that
we're
being,
asking
the
court
to
apply
here,
the
distinction
between
a
gift
or
contribution
and
a
purchase.
the
1970
revenue
ruling
was
simply
an
attempt
to
update
the
1919
revenue
ruling.
there
had
been
a
change
in
statutory
provisions
and
so
forth.
there's
no
analysis
in
that
whatsoever.
the
other
revenue
ruling,
which
is
more
or
less
or
point,
has
to
do
with
mass
stipends,
and
that
was
a
1978
revenue
ruling,
which
made
quite
clear
that
the
facts
that
were
presented
in
that
case
involved
a
mass
that
would
have
been
said
in
any
event
and
a
mass
that
was
open
to
the
general
public.
and
the
conclusion
it
reached
was
that
in
most
circumstances
the
payment
of
the
mass
stipend
was
incidental
and
was
not
something
that
would
not
be
deductible.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
well,
it
may
simply
be,
justice
scalia,
that...
i
mean,
there
may
be,
there
may
be
several
reasons
why
there
aren't
more
reported
cases
directly
involving
religious
services.
it's
difficult
to
pick
up
these
things
on
audit.
all
you've
got
is,
is
the
listing
of
a
gift
to
a
church
and
cancelled
check
payable
to
the
church.
in
addition,
i
don't
think
it's
quite
true,
it's
certainly
not
true
in
the
sense
that
the
petitioners
argue
that
there
is
no
analogous
precedent
that
supports
the
proposition
that
payments
for
religious
services
are
not
deductible.
and
i
think
that
the
religious
education
cases
are
particularly
instructive
here,
and
much
more
instructive
than
the
petitioner
lets
on.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
yes.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
which
point,
justice--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--i'm
not
sure
when
the
reference
to
other
religious
practices
crept
into
the
litigation--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--in
this
particular...
there
is
some
reference
to
this
argument
in
the
first
circuit's
opinion
in
this
case.
i
don't
recall
any
reference
to
it--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--the
first
circuit's
opinion--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--i
believe,
is
1987.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
i
have...
i
don't
know
that
the
internal
revenue
has
done
anything,
justice
marshall,
because
we
don't
think
that,
as
i've
been
explaining
to
justice
o'connor,
we
don't
interpret
our
regulations
as
being
inconsistent
with
the
position
that
was
taken
in
this
particular
case.
they
are
simply
applications
of
the
same
position
that
we're
taking
here.
i
think
it's
important
to
realize
the
argumentative
strategy
that
the
petitioners
adopted
here.
the
tax
court
relied
upon
a
whole
list
of
factors,
factual
findings,
that
were
strongly
indicative
of
an
intention
to
purchase
services
rather
than
to
make
a
gift.
and
what
petitioners
have
gone
is
they've
gone
town
each
particular
one
of
those
factors
and
said,
oh,
but
wait,
we
can
point
to
another
religion
that
has
a
practice
somewhat
analogous
to
that
particular
element.
and
then
they
say,
as
to
the
next
factor,
well,
but
wait,
there's
yet
another
religion
that
has
another
factor
like
that.
but
what
they
haven't
done
is
point
to
anyone
who
has
all
of
the
features,
or
anything
even
close
to
the
features,
that
are
presented
by
the
church
of
scientology
in
this
case.
they
haven't
pointed
to
a
case
where
a
church
is
selling
admission
tickets
at
the
door
in
order
to
attend
religious
services.
if
such
a
case
did
exist,
and,
and
had
beer
decided
differently,
then
there
might
be
a
problem
of
administrative
consistency--
let
me
go
pack
just
quickly
to
the
point
about
religious
education,
because
i
think
it's
important.
it's
well-established
that
tuition
payments
for
education
are
not
deductible,
it's
established
that
that
applies
to
a
completely
sectarian
as
well
as
non-sectarian
church
school.
no
distinction
is
made
as
to
whether
or
not
the
educational
instruction
serves
as
a
substitute
for
ordinary
schooling
or
whether
it
takes
place
in
the
church.
and
finally,
and
i
think
this
is
the
truly
critical
point,
although
virtually
all
the
parochial
school
cases
that
are
cited
by
petitioners
have
involved
the
provision
of
purely
religious
services,
as
well
as
educational
services,
there
has
never
been
a
suggestion
made
that
there
should
be
some
apportionment
between
the
component
that
reflects
the
education
and
the
component
that
reflects
the
religious
services.
there
has
been
apportionment
in
those
cases,
but
it's
apportionment
between
the
amounts
of
contributions
and
the
costs,
without
any
differentiation
between
the
costs
of
the
education
and
the
costs
of
the
religious
services.
and
the
fact
that
deductions
have
been
disallowed
for
the
religious
service
component
of
those
cases,
i
think,
does
offer
substantial
support
for
the
proposition
that
there's
nothing
radical
or
untoward
about
the
position
that
the
commissions
take
in
this,
in
this
case,
positions
taken
in
this
case
that
religious
services
should
be
subject
to
the
same
general
standard,
the
same
quid
pro
quo
analysis
that
all
types
of
payments
are
made
under
section
170
of
the
code.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
