well,
the
arrangement,
the
arrangement
here
was
for
a
fixed
sum
to
be
paid,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
does
that
come
about?
is
it...
do
they
enter
into,
does
the
church
enter
into
an
agreement?
or
is
it
just
a
piecework
basis
that
any
rise
you
come
for
a
training
session
you
pay
some
money?
or
is
there
some
agreement
in
advance?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the--
--don't
we
have
to
distinguish
between
auditing
and
training
though,
when
you
talk
about
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
for
all
practical
purposes,
worshiping
in
this
church
is
not
permitted
except
upon
paying
a
certain
sum
every
time
you
worship?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
that
that's...
if
you
want
to
worship
you
have
to
pay,
and
therefore
you
certainly
should
be
able
to
deduct
it.
i
gather
that's
your
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
a
church
says,
well,
we'll
let
you
become
a
member
of
our
church
if
you
promise
every
year
from
now
on
to
contribute
$10,000.
that's
the
only,
that's
the
only
way
you
can
come
and
worship
in
our
church.
now,
i
would
think
you
would
say
that
that
wouldn't
prove
that
it
was
part
of
the
worship,
part
of
worship.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
certainly
have
been
deducted.
