justice
antonin
scalia
he
did
say
"generally"
in
that
quote
that
you
read,
didn't
he,
in
that
first
sentence?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
before
you
move
on,
just
something
you
said.
is
it
conceded
that
this
was
religious
worship
as
opposed
to
religious
instruction?
is
that
part
of
the
stipulation?
justice
antonin
scalia
one
can
study
a
sacred
text
without,
without
worshiping.
i
mean,
one
could
go
to,
you
know,
theology
school
and
study
sacred
text,
and
that's
not
necessarily
an
act
of
worship,
as
are
many
of
the
other
examples
that
you,
that
you
raise
in
your
brief,
such
as
high
holy
day
services
and
so
forth.
