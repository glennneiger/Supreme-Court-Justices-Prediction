mr.
adam
lawrence
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
1984
bankruptcy
act,
congress
has
neither
intended
to
nor
has
it
in
fact
abrogated
or
modified
any
of
the
petitioners'
seventh
amendment
rights.
we
feel
for
this
reason
that
this
court
need
not
explore
the
limits
or
the
margins
or
the
interstices
of
congress'
power
to
legislate
outside
the
seventh
amendment.
this
case
can
be
resolved
neatly
and
completely,
we
submit,
with
a
consideration
of
just
two
matters.
the
first
matter
is
the
unified
jurisdictional
structure
and
court
organizational
system
created
in
the
1984
bankruptcy
act.
the
second
consideration
is
the
entirely
legal
nature
of
the
cause
of
action
asserted
by
the
trustee
in
his
complaint
and
the
type
of
relief
he
asked
for.
turning
to
the
1984
act,
what's
significant,
highly
significant,
about
the
act
is
that
it
does
not
create
a
separate
jurisdictional
or
juridical
entity
called
the
bankruptcy
court.
what
it
does
create
are
a
group
of
bankruptcy
judges
who
are
denominated
a
"unit"
of
the
district
court
invested
with
the
power
of
judicial
officers
of
that
court.
what
congress
has
not
done
very
specifically
in
the
1984
act
is
create
out
of
these...
out
of
these
bankruptcy
judges
an
administrative
agency,
a
specialized
court
of
equity
or
specialized
court,
a
court
of
any
type,
or
a
legislative
tribunal.
congress
has
specifically
left
these
judges
as
dependent,
non-autonomous
adjuncts
or
units
of
the
plenary
united
states
district
court.
now,
it
wasn't
always
this
way,
and
i
think
a
historical
look
is
instructive
here.
mr.
adam
lawrence
yes,
sir.
mr.
adam
lawrence
well,
i...
the...
the
intent
of
congress
was
to
create
these
judges
obviously
not
as
article
iii
judges,
but
as
adjuncts
to
an
article
iii
court.
mr.
adam
lawrence
well,
if
that
is
the...
if
the
act
is
unconstitutional,
i
don't
think
that
necessarily
impacts
on
our
right
to
a
jury
trial.
mr.
adam
lawrence
well,
if
the...
if
the
intent
of
congress
was
to
do
an
unconstitutional
act,
obviously
an
interpretation
must
be
arrived
at
that
permits
a
constitutional
construction.
it
seems
to
me,
though,
that
the...
that
the
precedent
of
this
court
allows
article
iii
type
issues
or
public
rights
issues
or
issues
arising
out
of...
out
of
legislation
that
congress
enacts
to
be
decided
in
an
adjunct
fashion.
mr.
adam
lawrence
yes.
mr.
adam
lawrence
well,
my
argument
is
that
initially...
if
i
could
develop
it
historically,
the
argument
is...
and
from
the
1984
act...
that
congress
is
investing
jurisdiction
initially
and
in
the
first
instance
in
the
united
states
district
court
judges
and
the
united
states
district
court.
under
the
1984
act,
that
jurisdiction
need
not
be
shared.
the
united
states
district
court
judges,
in
whom
a
proceeding
is
emplaced,
may
or
may
not
choose
to
refer
that
proceeding
on
to
their
non-article
iii
adjuncts.
they
may
retain
jurisdiction
completely
within
themselves
and
resolve
this
issue
to
completion.
in
the
1978
act,
for
example--
mr.
adam
lawrence
--i
think
that
was
the
intent
of
congress
and
that's...
yes,
that's
what
i
would
have
to
argue
here
that
i
believe...
i
believe
that
was
the...
the
purpose.
mr.
adam
lawrence
well,
i
think
congress
intended,
by
creating
a
variety
of
supervisory
techniques
that
are
set
forth
in
28
157
and
in
1334,
to
so
control
these
adjuncts
as
to
make
their
decisions
essentially
fall
within
the
decisions
of
this
court
that...
allowing
such...
such
adjudications
by
judges
who
themselves
are
not
article
iii
judges,
but
are
so
subject
to
the
control
of
article
iii
judges
as
to
meet
the
requirements
of
article
iii.
the...
the
1984
act
created
a
bankruptcy
system
in
which
judges
need
not
refer
these
proceedings.
they
may
hear
the
concept
of
a
plenary
suit
under
the
1898,
of
a
summary
suit
under
the
1898
act,
to
use
those
terms
which
i
think
will
arise
in
this
case.
mr.
adam
lawrence
i'm
referring
to
the
united
states
district
court
judges.
mr.
adam
lawrence
yes,
sir.
under
the
1898
act
and
under
the
1978
act,
there
were
distinct
bankruptcy
courts
created,
and
they
were
invested
with
specific
jurisdictions.
under
the
1978
act,
all
that
jurisdiction
was
passed
through
to
the
bankruptcy
court
judges
and
not
vested
in
the
district
courts.
under
the
1898
act,
united
states
district
court
judges
were
vested
with
what
was
called
a
plenary
jurisdiction
and
bankruptcy
judges
or
referees
with
a
summary
jurisdiction,
and
there
was
very
little
cross-fertilization
between
the
two.
now,
of
course,
all
prior
historical
distinctions
are
erased.
all
that
jurisdiction
is
vested,
summary
and
plenary,
in
united
states
district
court
judges
who
may
hear
a...
a
case
and
proceeding
to
completion.
they
may
decide
claims.
they
may
distribute
the
last
dollar
of
the
estates,
and
they
may
decide
traditional
plenary
actions
such
as
avoidance
actions.
mr.
adam
lawrence
that's
true
too,
yes.
mr.
adam
lawrence
that's
absolutely
correct,
and
that's
my
point
that
there
were...
that
there
are
ordinary
civil
or
equitable
proceedings,
legal
equitable
proceedings,
that
fell
under
the
rubric
of...
of
plenary
and
that
there
were
summary
or
traditionally
administrative
type
equitable
proceedings
that
were
exclusively
the
realm
of
the
bankruptcy
judges
or
referees.
now,
of
course,
those
distinctions...
i
think
it's
critical
to
understand
in
the
1984
act...
are
erased.
these
cases
may
be...
proceedings
may
be
referred
to
the
bankruptcy
judges,
all
or
part
of
a
proceeding,
and
a
district
court
judge
may
withdraw
all
or
part
of
a
proceeding
and
choose
to
hear
it
himself.
another
important
jurisdictional
aspect
of
the
1984
act
is
found
in
28
1334(d).
in
that
section,
congress
has
stripped
from
the
bankruptcy
court
judges
any
power
that
they
possess
over
the
bankruptcy
res,
over
the
property
of
the
debtor,
over
the
property
of
the
estate,
and
vested
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
that
property
in
united
states
district
court
judges.
by
doing
this
i
think
congress
plainly
manifested
in
its
intent
that
the
old
concept
of
summary
jurisdiction
of
the
1984
act
is
no
longer
applicable
here.
the
basis
of
summary
jurisdiction,
as
that
term
is
used
and
as
some
people
have
equated
it
to
core
jurisdiction
under
the
1984
act,
is
that
a
bankruptcy
judge
is
precisely
a
judge
of
equity
because
of
his
ability
to
control
the
res,
to
control
equitably
the
access
to
the
res.
mr.
adam
lawrence
under
the
1898
act,
your
honor.
the...
i
think
the...
the
analogy
is
relevant
and...
and
it's
necessary
for
me
to...
to
erase
the...
the
possibility
that
summary
jurisdiction
is
the
same
as
core
jurisdiction
because--
mr.
adam
lawrence
--that's...
that's
correct,
but
the
notion
of
summary
jurisdiction
went
further
than
that
i
think
under
the
1898
act.
the
idea
of
a
bankruptcy
referee
or
a
bankruptcy
court
as
a
court
of
equity
was
based
in
large
part
on
the...
on
the
conception
that
it
had
control,
equitable
control,
over
creditor
and
claimant
access
to
the
res.
what
the
1984
act
has
done
is
eliminate
that
traditional
power
of
bankruptcy
judges
and
vest
it
entirely
in
a
plenary
court,
the
united
states
district
court,
a
court
of
complete
legal
and
equitable
jurisdiction.
now,
the
core
distinction
under
the
1984
act
is
a
significant
one.
in
the
1978
act,
congress,
as
it
did
in
the
1984
act,
vested
entire
jurisdiction
initially
in
the
united
states
district
court
and
then
passed
it
through
en
masse
to
the
bankruptcy
judges.
this
court
in
marathon
stated
that
that
type
of
wholesale
jurisdictional
abdication
was...
was
impermissible,
that
at
least
as
to
state-based
causes
of
actions,
that
type
of
investiture
of
jurisdiction
in
non-article
iii
judges
without
the
consent
of
the
parties,
with
only
normal
appellate
review
as...
as
an
article
iii
control
over
those
judges,
was...
was
insufficient.
congress,
it
seems
to
me,
responded
to
marathon
and
to
that...
to
that
article
iii
criticism
by
creating
the
core/non-core
distinctions,
and
in
the
core/non-core
distinction,
congress
placed
in
the...
in
the
non-core
category
all
those
cases
which
were
of
concern
to
this
court
under
article
iii,
that
is,
cases
with
state-based
causes
of
action.
by
default,
congress
had
to
create
a
second
category,
which
it
labeled
core,
in
which
it
placed
all
other
types
of
proceedings,
including
the
types
of
avoidance
actions
for
preferences
and
fraudulent
transfers
that...
the
latter
of
which
is
the
subject
of
this
proceeding.
the...
the
point
i
think
here
is
significant,
and
that
is
that
the
core/non-core
distinction
was
not
an
amendment
7
driven
distinction.
there
is
nothing
in
the
response
of
congress
in
the
core/non-core
category
that...
that
suggests
any
intention
to
affect
the
right
of
jury
trial
of
litigants
in
bankruptcy-related
disputes
in
seventh
amendment
matters,
to
abrogate
the
right,
to
modify
the
right,
to
touch
it
in
any
way.
and
you
can
see
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
1984
act,
to
the
extent
there
is
a
legislative
history,
that
the
history
is
rife
with
statements
about
marathon,
about
whether
bankruptcy
judges
should
be
article
i
judges
or
article
iii
judges.
there's
no
apparent
discussion
in
the
legislative
history
of...
of
amendment
7
or
of
an
intent
to
affect
amendment
7
rights
or
of
a
desire
to
limit
access
to
a
jury
in
traditionally
plenary
or
common
law
causes
of
action,
such
as
the
one
we're
dealing
with
here.
xxx.
mr.
adam
lawrence
yes,
i
think
it
can,
and
i
think
this
court,
for
instance,
in
pernell
assumed
that
it
could.
that
was
a
district
of
columbia
court
in...
in
a
seventh
amendment
case.
this
court
had
no
apparent
difficulty
with
a
non-article
iii
judge
providing
an
article
vii
jury
trial.
and
i
suspect
there
are
other
precedents
as
well.
mr.
adam
lawrence
no,
sir.
no.
the
case
commenced,
of
course,
as
your
honor
knows,
in
united
states
district
courts.
mr.
adam
lawrence
i
don't
know
if
there
was
any
understanding
at
that
time.
mr.
adam
lawrence
well,
at
that
time,
the
rules
didn't.
at
that
time
rule
9015,
which
was
only
abrogated
in
august
1987,
envisioned
jury
trials
in
bankruptcy,
and
there
was
an
in-place
mechanism.
there
would
have
been
no
reason
for
the
litigant...
and
there
was
none
in
this
case...
to
suspect
that
a
transfer
to
district
court...
i
mean,
to
the
united
states...
to
the
united
states
bankruptcy
judge
would
have
divested
him
of
a
right
of
access
to
a
jury.
it
was
later
that
that
question
was
raised
and
the
mechanism
was
removed
from
the...
from
the
bankruptcy
scheme.
mr.
adam
lawrence
as
i
read
the
decisions
of
this
court,
no,
sir,
i
don't.
mr.
adam
lawrence
yes,
it
is.
and
whether
this
court
decides
that
under
the
setup
that
congress
created
a
bankruptcy
judge
could
not
hear
this
matter
with
a
jury,
at
least
in
the
seventh
amendment
sense,
is
not
of
particular
importance
to
us
since
we're
entitled
to
a
jury
trial,
and
presumably
if
this
matter
was
remanded,
reference
could
be
withdrawn
and
the
matter
could
be
heard
before
the
united
states
district
court
judge
with
a
jury.
mr.
adam
lawrence
well--
mr.
adam
lawrence
--well,
i
have
to
repeat
my...
my
last
response
was
that
with
sufficient
control,
such
as
the
controls
that
this
court
suggested
and
which
congress
implemented
in
state-related
causes
of
action,
certainty
in
congressional-related
causes
of
action,
the
same
type
of
oversight
by
an
article
iii
court
over
a
non-article
iii
court
would
satisfy
article
iii
concerns.
the--
mr.
adam
lawrence
--the
oversight
is,
a,
the
ability
not
to
refer
the
case
at
the
inception;
b,
the
ability
to
refer
all
or
part
of
the
proceeding;
three,
the
ability
to
withdraw
all
or
part
of
the
proceeding;
four,
the
ability
to
make
rules
and
regulations
governing
procedure
in
the
bankruptcy
adjuncts
and
coupled
with
the
right
of
appeal.
i
think
that
package
of
controls
by
an
article
iii
court
over
its
non-article
iii
adjunct
is
sufficient--
mr.
adam
lawrence
--certainly
bankruptcy-related
suits,
yes.
we're
dealing
here
with
an
action
created
under
title
11
of
the
bankruptcy
laws.
it's...
to
the
extent
it
was
a
congressional
creation,
i...
don't
see
any
conceptual
difficulty
or
at
least
absolute
impediment
in
this...
in
a
referral
and
in
a
sustained--
mr.
adam
lawrence
--no,
completely
distinguishable,
your
honor.
that
was
a
state-based
cause
of
action.
one
must,
i
suppose,
be
concerned
about
the
various
dichotomies
this
court
drew,
public
and
private
rights
and
the
like.
we're
dealing
here
with
a...
with
a
congressional
enactment
and
presumably
the
power
of
congress
to
have
something
to
say
about
the
forum
in
which
it...
it
will
allow
that
right
to
be
adjudicated.
mr.
adam
lawrence
the...
the
suit
by
the
litigant
there
was,
of
course,
a
state-based
cause
of
action.
mr.
adam
lawrence
that's
correct.
mr.
adam
lawrence
well,
i'm
not...
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
a
distinction
between
an
article
iii
side
and
a
non-article
iii
side.
do
you
mean...
by
side,
do
you
mean
remain
in
the
united
states
district
court--
mr.
adam
lawrence
--as
opposed
to
being
referred
on?
to
the
extent
that
there's
no
federal
codification
of
the
statute
of
elizabeth
that
forms
the
underlying
cause
of
action,
yes.
mr.
adam
lawrence
i'd
say
arguably
that--
mr.
adam
lawrence
--i--
mr.
adam
lawrence
--no.
i'd
say
anytime
a...
a
non-bankruptcy-related...
that
is,
in
the...
in
the...
in
the
mold
of
the
types
of
causes
of
action
that
states
have
jurisdiction
to
create...
is
presented
to
a
bankruptcy
court,
that
that
would
fall
under
the
non-core...
probably
non-core
jurisdiction
and
be
subject
to
the...
the
particular
procedural
constraints
of
the
non-core
category;
that
is,
that
bankruptcy
judges
could
make
findings
of
fact
and
recommendations
and
the
ultimate,
final
decision
would
have
to
be
made
by
a...
a
united
states
district
court
judge.
i
would
have...
if
there
was
a...
i
have
difficulty
i
guess
with
the
idea
of
an
independent
codification
of
a...
of
a
state
law
right,
but
ultimately
i
think
they
may
amount
to
the
same
thing
in
terms
of
bankruptcy
district
court
control.
whether
it
initially
starts
out
or
ends
up
as
a
non-core
proceeding
or
whether
it
starts...
or
whether
it
ends
up
as
a
core
proceeding
is
of
less
importance,
it
seems
to
me,
under
the
1984
act
where
everything
has
to
start
with
the
united
states
district
court
judge
and
then
is
parceled
out
or
withdrawn
after
reference
appropriately.
mr.
adam
lawrence
if
you
do
view
it
equitably...
as
an
equitable
cause
of
action,
that's
correct.
but
i
don't
see
how,
without
overruling
schoenthal
which
specifically
addresses
this
question,
this
court
could
conceivably
either
view
the
demand
for
relief
or
the
judgment
entered
or
the
cause
of
action
as...
as
an
equitable
one.
schoenthal
speaks
directly
to
this
issue
in
a
preference
matter
which
is
now
under
547.
we're
under
548
of
title
11,
but
for
seventh
amendment
purposes,
we'd
suggest
that
these
two
monetary...
that
monetary
avoidance
actions
under
either
section
are
indistinguishable.
schoenthal
clearly
referred
back
to
pre...
to
18th
century
english
common
law,
found
that
assignees
under
bankruptcy
acts
at
that
period
of
time
were
suing
for
monetary
preferences
under
well-recognized
common
law
forms
of
actions,
such
as
indebitatus
assumpsit,
a
cause
of
action
for
money
had
and
received,
and
that
this
tradition
has
persisted,
and
that
the
seventh
amendment
requires
a
trial
by
jury
of
a
money
judgment
where
only
a
money
judgment
is
asked
for
in
an
avoidance
action.
so,
i'd
say
schoenthal
is
directly
dispositive
of
the
equitable
or
legal
nature
of
this
cause
of
action.
the
distinction
between
core
and
summary
i
think
is
necessary
to
be
alluded
to
again.
core
actions
are
not
the
same
as
summary
actions,
and
i
think
that
the
circuit
court
decision
improperly
confused
the
two,
and
i
think
that
the
respondent
is
perpetuating
that
type
of
an
approach.
core
actions
were
not
in
their
inception
deemed
to
be
the
same
as
summary
actions,
and
i
think,
first,
there
is
no
stronger
indication
of
that
than
congress
stripped
the
bankruptcy
judges
under
section
1334(d)
of
authority
over
the
property
of
the
res.
secondly,
the
idea
of
summary
jurisdiction
only
has
meaning
when
there's
plenary
jurisdiction
and
summary
and
plenary
jurisdiction
only
have
meaning
when
there
are...
when
there's
a
bifurcated
or
fractionalized
jurisdictional
scheme
in
bankruptcy.
there
is
no
longer
a
fractionalized
scheme.
it's
as...
as
metaphysically
irrelevant
as
speaking
of
the
concept
of
lightness
when
there
is
no
concept
of
darkness.
everything
today
is
in
a
unified
district
court
judge.
let
me...
let
me
allude
to
another
factor,
justice
o'connor,
in
the
legal
versus
equitable
area.
i
perceive
the
respondent
is
having
difficulty
with
the...
with
the
power
and
directness
of
schoenthal,
and
he
suggests
several
things
as
a
way
of
circumventing
that
decision.
he
first
suggests
that
really
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
a
restitutionary
cause
of
action,
not
a
compensatory
cause
of
action.
well,
i
think
historically
the
distinction
is
a
meaningless
one
since,
first
of
all,
the
causes
of
action
for
money
had
and
received
was
precisely
a
restitutionary
remedy
which
18th
century
english
courts
adopted
as
their
own
and
provided
for
a
jury
trial
for.
it
was,
in
essence,
a
cause
of
action
for
money
had
and
received
that
this
court
was
dealing
with
in
schoenthal
and
found
no
difficulty
in
locking
through
that...
that
apparent
definition
and
saying,
well,
it's
a
money
judgment
that's
sought,
and
that's
sufficient
to
activate
the
seventh
amendment.
mr.
adam
lawrence
katchen
v.
landy,
your
honor,
had
relevance
at
a
time
when
bankruptcy
jurisdiction
was
bipartite
jurisdiction.
there
was,
prior
to
the
1978
act
and
certainly
prior
to
the
1984
act,
a
real
possibility
when
faced
with
facts
such
as
those
unique
to
katchen
that
the
bankruptcy
scheme
could
be
dismembered
or
dismantled,
that
a...
that
an
equity
plaintiff
who
was
both
a...
a
creditor,
against
whom
a
preference
objection
was
imposed
and
who
also
might
be
a
litigant
in...
in
an
independent
plenary
action
to
recover
the
preference,
had
a
right
to
have
a
continuous
and
fair
proceeding
not
punctuated
by
having
to
cross
the
hall
or
having
to
cross
the
street
to
invoke
or
be
subject
to
a
judge
with
different
jurisdiction.
so,
there
was
a
chance
at
that
time
of
an
unfair
result,
and
i...
i
view
the
katchen
doctrine
as
a
product
of
that
equitable
regime
in
an
attempt
to
avoid
that
statutory
dismantlement.
but
just
as
plainly,
congress
has
not
created
that...
that
bifurcated
jurisdiction
under
the
1984
act.
everything
could
be
accomplished
now.
mr.
adam
lawrence
yes,
sir,
it
old.
yes,
we,
of
course,
don't
have
the--
mr.
adam
lawrence
--no,
sir.
no.
mr.
adam
lawrence
that's
true.
mr.
adam
lawrence
yes,
i
think
this
court
recognized
the
difficulty
of
a
waiver
of
consent
argument
in
that
lengthy
footnote.
we
don't
base
our
view
of
katchen
on
waiver
or
non-waiver.
mr.
adam
lawrence
precisely
in
what
section
1334(d)
now
takes
away
and
that
is
the
power
of
a
court
of
equity
over
the
res.
it's
in
that
power
that
this
court
has
equitable
jurisdiction
to
control
access
to--
mr.
adam
lawrence
--that's...
that's
true.
mr.
adam
lawrence
well,
katchen
i
think
depends
on
two
things.
it
depends
on
the
underlying
supposition
that
a
bankruptcy
referee
exercising
summary
jurisdiction
is
essentially
sitting
as
a
court
of
equity
which
leads
back
to
the
idea
of
what
makes
a
bankruptcy
judge,
at
least
for
preference
and
avoidance
actions
and
fraudulent
transfer
actions,
a
court
of...
a
court
of
equity.
it's
precisely
the
control
over
the
res.
a
bankruptcy
referee
or
judge
with
no
control
over
the
res
could
not
avoid...
could
not
call
himself
a
judge
possessing
summary
jurisdiction
in
the
historical
bankruptcy
since...
since
he
would
have
no
control
over
those
causes
of
action.
mr.
adam
lawrence
well,
it's...
it's
a--
mr.
adam
lawrence
--that's
true.
mr.
adam
lawrence
that's
true.
mr.
adam
lawrence
the
res...
bankruptcy...
the
bankruptcy
act
i
believe
at
that
time,
as
it
does
today,
defines
the
inchoate
right
to
recover
a
preference
or
avoidance
as
a
form
of
property
of
the
estate.
and
so,
it's
not
i
suppose
strictly
accurate
to
call
it
property
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
but
constructive--
mr.
adam
lawrence
--that's
true.
mr.
adam
lawrence
yes,
yes.
that's
true.
the...
i'd
like
to
reserve,
if
i
may,
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
adam
lawrence
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
adam
lawrence
that
that's
void
because
of
1334(d)?
mr.
adam
lawrence
no.
mr.
adam
lawrence
well,
i...
i
hadn't
articulated
the
argument
that
way
i...
i...
i
don't
know
that
i
could
object
to
that
whether
it's
void
or
not.
i--
mr.
adam
lawrence
--well,
there
is
a
way
i
suppose
of
avoiding
that
construction
by
saying
that
this
is
the
type
of
case
that
shouldn't
be
referred
in
the
first
place.
i
know
that
renders
perhaps
irrelevant
a
section
of
the
act,
but
there
is
a
role
for
bankruptcy...
for
district
judges
to
be
sensitive
to
what
can
and
can't
be
tried
in
bankruptcy.
of
course,
with
9015
in
place
at
that
time,
i
don't
think
anyone's
attention
was
specifically
directed
to
the
article
iii
issue
of
what
could
or
could
not
be
heard
by
an
non-article
iii
judge,
the
bankruptcy
judge.
mr.
adam
lawrence
no,
sir,
it's
not.
mr.
adam
lawrence
it's,
as
far
as
i
know,
a
private
colombian
banking
institution.
that
was
not
nationalized.
mr.
adam
lawrence
i
think
colombia,
but
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
it
has
been
referred
to
as
a
latin
american
banking
institution.
i
know
its
headquarters
were
in
bogota,
and
so
it
might
be
reasonable
to
assume
it's
colombian,
but
i
don't
know
that.
mr.
adam
lawrence
i
know.
mr.
adam
lawrence
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
on
the
issue
of
money
damages,
there
are
certain
similarities
here
between
compensatory
remedies
and
what
was
sought
and
achieved
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
the...
the
award
under
548-550
is
not
a
discretionary
remedy.
if
you
prove
the
criteria
for
avoidance
which
isn't
a
separate,
independent
equitable
action
in
and
of
itself,
you're
entitled
to
that
amount
of
dollars
without
any
intercession
of
a...
of
the
discretionary
mind
of
a
jury
or
a...
or
a
judge.
the...
the
payment
here
was
of
sums
which
will
go
to
compensate
creditor
claimants
for
common
law
torts
committed
against
them,
for
common
law
breaches
of
contract
committed
against
them.
in
a
very
real
sense
the
use
to
which
these...
this
judgment
will
be
put,
if
it's
recovered,
is
to
compensate
those
who
have
state
law
claims
who
are
essentially,
i
gather,
unsecured
creditors
for
a
variety
of
state
law
claims
that
characterize
claimants
in
bankruptcy.
to
the
extent
the
trustee
recovers
money
in
avoidance
actions,
he...
he
pays
off
people
who
are
seeking
damages
in
the
classical
legal
sense.
to
the
extent
he
doesn't
recover
dollars,
these
people
go
uncompensated
in
classical
legal
sense.
i
think
it's
deceptive
to
speak
of
the
dollars
in
dispute
here
as
not
being
compensatory
at
least
in
the
final
analysis.
secondly,
i
think
it's...
it's
unnecessary
and
unwise
to
base
the
seventh
amendment
jurisprudence
on
the
arcane
distinctions
between
a
compensatory
dollar
and...
and
a
restitutionary
dollar
when
those
terms,
as
we
all
know,
can
be
intermingled
and...
and...
and
converted
from
one
to
the
other.
seemingly,
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
questions,
i
think
the
proper
basis
of
equity
jurisdiction
and
legal
jurisdiction
is
still...
is
the
judgment...
is
to
relieve
something
that's
uniquely
within
the
power
of
a
court
of
law
to
grant.
money
judgments
and
whether
the
dollar
composing
the
judgment
is
a
compensatory
dollar
or
a
restitutionary
dollar
is
still
a
traditionally
legal
cause
of
action.
and
i
think
that's
the
basis
on
which
a
seventh
amendment
jurisprudence
should...
should
rest,
not
this
confusion
definition
between
compensatory
and
restitutionary.
thank
you.
