unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
my
constitution
says
that
the
judges,
both
of
the
supreme
and
inferior
courts,
shall
hold
their
offices
during
good
behavior.
unknown
speaker
and
yet
you
say
these
bankruptcy
officers
who
don't
hold
their
offices
during
good
behavior
are
members
of
an
inferior
court
of
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
i'm
saying
that
intent
is
unconstitutional
if
that
was
the
intent.
unknown
speaker
or
else
it
wasn't
their
intent.
i
mean,
that's
another
alternative.
unknown
speaker
by
a
non-article
iii
court,
correct.
unknown
speaker
but
you're
saying
it's
being
decided
by
an
article
iii
court
with
non-article
iii
judges,
as
i
understand
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
the...
the...
under
your
theory,
the
decision
that
these
adjuncts
make
is
a
decision
of
a
united
states
district
court,
as
i
understand
your...
your
theory.
unknown
speaker
i...
i
don't
see
how
that
can
be.
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
judges
need
not
refer
these
things,
you're
referring
to
the
bankruptcy
judges.
unknown
speaker
you're
referring
to
the
district
judges.
unknown
speaker
well,
traditional
plenary
actions
under
the
1898
act
could
be
brought
in
state
court.
unknown
speaker
so,
it
wasn't
just
a
question
of
vesting
federal...
federal
district
judges.
they
were
just
the
kind
of
lawsuits
that
you
try
in
courts
of
first
instance,
the
same
way
we
do
lots
of
other
lawsuits.
unknown
speaker
you're
referring
now
to
summary
jurisdiction
as
it
existed
at
what...
under
what
act?
unknown
speaker
no.
summary
jurisdiction
under
the
1898
act
was
possession...
property
that
was
in
the
possession
of
the
trustee
or
where
the...
the
claimant
had
submitted
a
claim.
unknown
speaker
well,
can
a
non-article...
a
non-article
iii
court
can
provide
a
party
with
the
party's
seventh
amendment
right,
can
it
not?
unknown
speaker
in...
in
this
case
did
you
object
to
the
transfer
of
the
case
to
the
bankruptcy
court?
unknown
speaker
was
the
bankruptcy...
was
that
on
the
understanding
that
the
bankruptcy
court
would
conduct
a
jury
trial?
unknown
speaker
because
the
rules
prevent
that.
unknown
speaker
so,
you
don't
say
that...
you
don't...
you
don't
say
that
there's
any
independent
bar
to
a
non-article
iii
court
hearing
this
issue?
unknown
speaker
you
just
say
that...
so,
your
jury
trial
is
your
only
focus.
unknown
speaker
well,
what...
i
don't...
i
don't
understand
what's
left
of
the
seventh
amendment
then
which
says
"in
suits
at
common
law,
the
right
of
trial
by
jury
is
preserved.
"
you're
saying...
you're
saying
it's
still
a
suit
at
common
law
even
though
you...
you
give
it
to...
to
a
non-article
iii
forum.
unknown
speaker
and
you
can
willy-nilly
give
suits
at
common
law
to
non-article
iii
forums.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand.
what
kind
of
oversight
are
you
talking--
unknown
speaker
--to
enable
all
common
law
suits
to
be
returned
to
non-article
iii
adjuncts.
unknown
speaker
this
then
is
not
like
the
action
that
was
involved
in
the
minnesota
trial
in
the
marathon
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
courses,
we
were
dealing
with
a
congressional
enactment
in
marathon
too.
unknown
speaker
so,
you
mean
here
we're
dealing
with
a
cause
of
action
created
by
congress.
unknown
speaker
preference.
well,
suppose
that
the
parties
just
proceeded
under
the
statute
of
elizabeth
and
under
state
law
in
a
federal
court.
that
would
have
to
under
your
analysis
then
remain
on
the
article
iii
side
of
the
court?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
so...
so,
anytime
that
the
federal
statute
codifies
the
common
law,
there's--
unknown
speaker
--there's
no
jury
right?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
you
would
be
arguing
the
opposite.
unknown
speaker
mr.
lawrence,
if
we
view
this
cause
of
action
as
an
equitable
one,
there
is
no
seventh
amendment
right
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
deal
with
the
case
of
katchen
v.
landy?
unknown
speaker
but
katchen
did
say
the
bankruptcy
court
without
a
jury
could
adjudicate
that
preference.
unknown
speaker
and
you
don't...
you
don't...
you
don't
suggest
that
katchen
rested
on
a
waiver,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
was
a
case,
though,
where
the
creditor
had
submitted
his
claim--
unknown
speaker
--to
the
trustee.
unknown
speaker
well,
where
did
the
court
get
the
power
to
adjudicate
the
preference
without
a
jury?
unknown
speaker
so,
then
you
say
that
the
source
of
it
was...
the
statute
gave...
clearly
gave
the
court
the
statutory
right
to
adjudicate
that,
and
you
say
that
because
it
was
equitable,
no
jury
trial.
unknown
speaker
katchen
doesn't
depend,
at
least
as
i
read
the
opinion,
on
the
fact
that
there
was
a
res
in
the
possession
of
the
trustee.
the...
there
was
simply
a
submission
of
a
claim,
was
there
not?
unknown
speaker
wasn't
the
claim
submitted
in
katchen
one
where
there
was
property...
based
on
one
where
there
was
property
in
the
possession
of
the
trustee?
yes,
yes.
justice
white
says
the--
unknown
speaker
--well,
he
tiled
his
claim.
unknown
speaker
and
he
wanted
a
piece
of
the
res.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
res?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
under
the
1898
act,
had
there
been
no
claim
filed,
the
creditor
could
have
told
the
trustee
to
go
whistle
and
bring
a
plenary
action.
unknown
speaker
still
can.
unknown
speaker
just
one...
one
more
question
so
i
understand
you.
section...
subsection
h
of
157
in
your
view
is
then
void?
unknown
speaker
which
says
proceeding...
the
bankruptcy
courts
can
try
proceedings
to
determine,
avoid,
or
recover
fraudulent
conveyances.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
void
because
there's
no
jury
trial.
there's
no
jury
trial
permitted
by
a
rule.
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
to
say
that,
don't
you,
if...
if
no
jury
trial
is
permitted
in
the
bankruptcy
court
and
this
statute
permits
that
action
to
be
tried
in
the
bankruptcy
court,
then
the
statute
is
void.
unknown
speaker
mr.
lawrence,
i'm
just
curious.
is
medex
an
instrumentality
of
the
colombian
government?
unknown
speaker
what
is
it?
unknown
speaker
incorporated
where?
unknown
speaker
it's
like
referring
to
a
corporation
as
a
north
american
corporation.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
lawrence.
mr.
tribe,
we'll
hear
from
you
now.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
distinguish
schoenthal?
unknown
speaker
it's
also
the
issue
in
katchen.
unknown
speaker
in
that...
in
that
case,
in
katchen,
the
creditor
had
to
file
the
claim
and
submit
it
himself
in
a
way...
at
least
to
the
trustee,
in
a
way
that
was
not
done
here.
unknown
speaker
xxx
very
well-accepted
regime
under
the
1898
act,
at
least
in
my
own
practice.
you
know,
if...
if
you
wanted
to
file
a
claim
in
bankruptcy
and,
you
know,
get
part
of
the
assets--
unknown
speaker
--in
the
hands
of
the
trustee,
you
submitted
yourself
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
bankruptcy
court.
if
you
thought
your
security
of
it
wasn't--
unknown
speaker
--possessed
by
the
trustee
was
more
valuable,
you
just
stayed
out
of
the
bankruptcy
court.
but
no
one
doubted
that
you
had
to
fish
or
cut
bait.
unknown
speaker
xxx
some
of
the
reasoning
in
schoenthal
suggests
a
fraudulent
conveyance
claim
was
the
type
of
thing
that
was
tried
to
juries
at
common
law.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
the
district
judge
had
just
kept
the
case
for
himself
or
herself.
unknown
speaker
would
you--
--well,
it
seems--
--would
you...
go
ahead.
it
seems
to
give
very
little
force
to
the
seventh
amendment
to
say
that
the
district
court
can,
by
deciding
either
to
retain
the
action
itself
or
submit
it
to
the
bankruptcy
court,
affect
the
jury
trial
right.
that
gives
very
little
content,
it
seems
to
me,
to
the
seventh
amendment.
unknown
speaker
so,
then
it
is
the
nature
of
the
action
and
not
the
nature
of
the
forum
that
controls.
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
that
in
the
tull
case
that
justice
brennan
wrote
a
couple
years
ago
congress
could
have
referred
that
sort
of
a
dispute
to
the
epa
and
if
the
epa
decided
it
wouldn't
have
to
give
a
jury
trial
and
then
simply
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
appeal?
unknown
speaker
tull
was
going
to
be
acting
within
its
substantive
power
or
its
actions
are
invalid
for
another
reason.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
curtis
v.
loether?
unknown
speaker
mr.
tribe,
can
i...
i'm
not
sure
what
your...
your
colleague's
position
on
this
is.
i
think,
though,
that
his
position
is
that
the
seventh
amendment
right
to
a
jury
goes
together
with
the
seventh
amendment
right
to
an
article
iii
court.
is
that
your...
do
you
concede
that
you
can
have
a
jury
trial
right
even
though
you're
in
a...
in
a
non-article
iii
forum?
unknown
speaker
xxx
proceeded
to
carry
out
in
marathon.
unknown
speaker
well,
may
i
interrupt
right
there?
unknown
speaker
isn't
it
always
not
equitable
to
do
so
if
there's
an
adequate
remedy
at
law?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that--
unknown
speaker
--and
that's
what
schoenthal
relied
of--
unknown
speaker
--well,
it's
more
than
a
preference.
it
was
a
rule
of
law
that
there
is
no
equity
jurisdiction
if
there's
an
adequate
remedy
at
law.
unknown
speaker
but
was
that
also
not
a
common
law
rule?
unknown
speaker
mr.
tribe,
is
what
was
referred
to
as
267
of
the
judicial
code
in
schoenthal...
is
that
still
in
effect?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
that
was
a
factual
question,
wasn't
it,
that
would
have
been
decided
either
by
the
jury
or
by
the
court?
unknown
speaker
if
you're
right,
anytime
the
trustee
claims
that
there
was
an
improper
payment
from...
to
someone,
that
will
not...
that
person
will
not
be
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
now,
in
some
cases
undoubtedly
there
was
an
improper
payment;
in
some
cases
there
won't
have
been.
but
the
question
here
is
however
it
comes
out
on
the
merits,
do
you
get
a
jury
trial.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
interrupt?
unknown
speaker
i'm...
you're
kind
of
fast
for
me.
i
want
to
be
sure
i
stay
with
you.
are
you
saying
that
if
the
trustee
had
made
a
claim,
he
spelled
it
out
in
detail
in
his
allegation
and
said
this
money
was
fraudulently
transferred,
it
was
placed
into
a
bank
account
and
commingled
with
millions
of
dollars
and
transferred
to
another
bank
account,
so
it
would
be
impossible
to
trace
the
particular
funds
and
therefore
he
asks
for
a
money
judgment
in
the
equivalent
number
of
dollars,
he
would
then
have
a
jury
trial
right?
unknown
speaker
then
what
are
you
arguing?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
would
it
not
be
clear
that
in
18th
century
england
it
would
therefore
have
been
a
clear
action
at
law,
and
there
would
not
have
been
an
equitable
remedy?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
turnover
orders
aren't
always
for
money.
i
mean,
there
are
chattels
and
things
like
that.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
tribe.
mr.
lawrence,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
