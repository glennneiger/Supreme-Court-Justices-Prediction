mr.
laurence
tribe
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is,
of
course,
no
marathon
issue
here
because
there
was
no
objection
of
a
timely
kind
to
the
reference
to
the
district
court.
and
by
the
time
that
objection
had
been
made
and
when
it
was
rejected,
they
did
not
appeal
to
the
eleventh
circuit
on
that
issue
so
that
whatever
question
the
court
might
some
day
have
about
the
limits
of
power
under
the
1984
act
to
refer
matters
for
binding
decision
under
section
157
by
these
bankruptcy
judges
who,
as
justice
scalia
says,
are
of
course
article
i
entities,
is
not
here.
and
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
this
decision
against
granfinanciera
was
not,
despite
their
effort
to
reconstrue
it,
rendered
by
the
district
court
in
drag,
as
it
were,
sitting
as
a
kind
of
article
i
body
in
violation
of
the
constitution...
the
decision
was
rendered
by
the
bankruptcy
judge
or
referee
subject
only
to
review
by
the
article
iii
court.
and
the
question
really
is
whether
they
are
entitled
under
the
seventh
amendment
to
jury
trial.
they
would
have
that
question,
even
if
it
had,
indeed,
been
decided
by
the
article
iii
court,
but
then
they
would,
as
justice
scalia
suggests,
be
in
quite
a
different
position
because
then
at
least
one
could
understand
what
they
meant
by
saying
that
this
had
been
a
suit
at
common
law.
the
reason
that
they
want
to
make
it
look
as
though
the
decision
was
rendered
by
an
article
iii
court
is
somehow
to
bring
the
seventh
amendment
in
closer
proximity
to
their
client.
so,
i
think
the
puzzle
posed
by
the
case
is
how
the
seventh
amendment
comes
to
apply
at
all.
i
do
think
it's
useful
to
go
back
for
a
moment
to
the
chief
justice's
question
about
katchen
because,
as
i
understand
their
position...
and
this
makes
it
in
a
way
more
puzzling...
if
the
petitioners
had
been
among
chase
&
sanborn's
actual
creditors
and
if
the
$1.7
million
transferred
to
them
on
the
eve
of
bankruptcy
had
been
a
partial
repayment,
then
they
concede
they'd
have
no
right
to
a
jury
trial
about
the
facts
surrounding
the
transfer.
but,
you
see,
they
concede
they
were
not
creditors.
they
say
it
was
nonetheless
appropriate
to
shift
this
money
to
granfinanciera
because
of
favors
that
it
had
done
for
the
father
of
the
principal
officer
of
the
bankrupt
corporation,
an
officer
who
incidentally
is
serving
now
15
years
in
the
federal
penitentiary
for
bank
fraud.
so,
it
appears
that
their
position
is
that
because
they
make
no
claim
on
the
assets
of
chase
&
sanborn,
they
fall
outside
the
bankruptcy
claims
jurisdiction
and
therefore
they're
entitled
to
a
jury
before
being
ordered
to
turn
the
$1.7
million
over.
so,
the
paradox
is
that
because
they
have
no
legal
claim,
they're
entitled
to
more
process,
not
less.
now,
of
course,
sometimes
congress
or
the
constitution
mandates
odd
results.
but
i
do
not
think
that
a
persuasive
argument
has
been
made
that
that
result
is
mandated
here.
mr.
laurence
tribe
well,
we
believe,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
schoenthal
was
simply
a
decision
under
the
1898
act
which
said
that
when
congress
chooses,
as
it
old
in
the
1898
act,
by
requiring
the
bringing
of
a
plenary
suit
in
an
ordinary
common
law
court...
when
it
chooses
to
do
that,
to
force
the
trustee
to
sue
for
damages
at
law
on
the
law
side
of
the
district
court,
then
as
long
as
there
existed
a
common
law
analogue,
you're
entitled
under
the
seventh
amendment
to
jury
trial.
we
think
that
that's
entirely
correct.
but
we
do
not
think
that
schoenthal
stood
for
the
proposition
that
the
seventh
amendment
entitles
you
to
the
kind
of
forum
that
congress
happened
to
provide
in
that
case.
that
is,
the
real
question
is
whether
there
is
in
the
seventh
amendment
a
constitutional
rule
preventing
congress
from
placing
matters
of
the
kind
that
justice
kennedy
asked
about,
namely,
157(b)(2)(h),
fraudulent
conveyance
matters,
in
the
decision
power
of
a
bankruptcy
judge
who
is
not
an
article
iii
court.
that's
the
question
in
this
case.
and
the
statutory
scheme
in
schoenthal
is
not
before
us.
but
i
will--
mr.
laurence
tribe
--and
in
katchen,
the
court
clearly
held
i
think
that
there
is
no
seventh
amendment
right
in
that
circumstance.
one
odd
way
of
reading
katchen--
mr.
laurence
tribe
--that's
right.
but
i
suppose,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
question
would
be
what
alternative
choice
did
the
creditor
have.
in
kras
v.
united
states,
the
court
elaborated
the
debtor/creditor
situation
by
stressing
the
giving
the
debtor
a
means
of
discharging
the
bankruptcy
is
a
kind
of
privilege,
and
you
take
the
bitter
with
the
sweet.
if
there's
a
filing
fee,
you
may
have
to
pay
it.
but
the
court
went
out
its
way
in
kras
to
say
that
the
situation
of
the
creditor
is
really
quite
different.
the
creditor
has
no
alternative,
given
the
automatic
stay
of
section
362.
the
creditor's
property
interest
or
contract
interest
can
be
vindicated
only
by
submitting.
and
it
would
be
an
odd
regime
in
which
you
say,
well,
you
have
a...
a
right
to
a
seventh
amendment
forum,
but
you
must
give
that
right
up
in
order
to
protect
your
property.
the
court
avoided
that
reading
in
katchen.
mr.
laurence
tribe
uh-hum.
mr.
laurence
tribe
right.
mr.
laurence
tribe
oh,
i
agree,
mr.
chief
justice.
you
had
to
fish
or
cut
bait,
but
that
was
because
you
didn't
have
a
constitutional
right
to
the
fish.
that
is,
there
was
no
constitutional
right
to
a
seventh
amendment
forum
and,
therefore,
congress
could
put
you
to
the
choice.
if
you
want
a
jury
trial
on
the
fraudulent
conveyance
claim
or
the
preferential
transfer
claim,
then
don't
file
here.
but
that
was--
mr.
laurence
tribe
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
was
tried
concurrently
at
common
law
both
in
law
and
in
equity,
but
before
i
think
we
need
to
reach
that
issue,
which
is
an
alternative
ground
for
supporting
the
result
in
this
case...
before
we
need
to
reach
it,
there
is
the
anterior
question
of
whether
in
the
forum
that
was
involved
in
this
case,
which
was
a
specialized
bankruptcy
forum,
whether
in
that
forum
there
is
a
seventh
amendment
right
to
jury
trial.
mr.
laurence
tribe
it
would
be
perhaps
a
harder
case,
but
we
believe
that
congress
in
1984
still
created
with
respect
to
the
bankruptcy
core,
the
matters
listed
in
157...
the
matters
listed
in
section
157(b)(2),
a
specialized
equitable
jurisdiction.
it
was
not
crucial
to
that
specialized
equitable
jurisdiction
that
there
be
physical
control
of
a
res.
that
really
isn't
the
points.
the
point
is
that
the
bankruptcy
jurisdiction,
the
jurisdiction
to
reassemble
the
estate
and
ratably
distribute
it
is
one
that
congress
could,
under
the
bankruptcy
clause,
constitutionally
entrust
to
a
specialized
equitable
procedure.
mr.
laurence
tribe
justice
kennedy,
that's
why
i'm
inclined...
that's
one
of
the
reasons
why
i'm
inclined
to
think
that
neither
by
statute
nor
under
the
seventh
amendment
would
there
be
a
right
to
jury
trial
on
this
fraudulent
conveyance
matter
even
if
it
had
been
retained.
we
don't
think
there's
any
evidence
in
the
statute
or
in
the
legislative
history
to
suggest--
mr.
laurence
tribe
--well,
in
this
case
we
have
both.
in
this
case
the
nature
of
the
forum
and
the
nature
of
the
action
point
away
from
a
jury
trial.
mr.
laurence
tribe
well,
under
the
atlas
roofing
case,
it
seems
to
me
the
court
suggested
that
as
long
as
congress
acts
within
its
substantive
power
with
respect
to
matters
of
either
environment
or
employee
safety...
in
that
case,
it
was
an
osha
regulation...
the
power
of
congress--
mr.
laurence
tribe
--well,
that's
right,
but
when
you
look,
mr.
chief
justice,
at
all
of
the
cases
in
which
this
court
has
said
that
cases
that
used
to
be
brought
at
common
law
can
be
transferred
to
an
agency,
landlord-tenant
disputes
in
block
v.
hirsh
in
1921--
mr.
laurence
tribe
--in
curtis
v.
loether,
congress
hadn't
decided...
and
therefore
the
issue
wasn't
presented
there
and
isn't...
and
wasn't
presented
in
many
of
these
other
cases...
to
create
a
specialized
jurisdiction.
but
the
question
that's
presented...
since
their
brief
concedes
that
congress
has
not
by
statute
preserved
the
jury
trial
right,
the
question
that's
presented
is
whether
congress'
power...
and
i
admit
you
can
put
extreme
cases
that
test
its
limits,
but
whether
congress'
power
under
the
bankruptcy
clause
extends
to
the
provision
of
equitable
bankruptcy
jurisdiction
without
juries
as
fact
finders,
whether
in
a
specialized
article
i
body
or
as
in
katchen
in
the
article
iii
court
itself,
to
the
process
of
recovering
a
bankrupt
estate's
improper
eve-of-bankruptcy
transfers
as
well
as
to
the
process
of
ratably
distributing
the
reassembled
assets.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
nothing
is
more
closely
related
to
the
effective
functioning
of
a
system
of
resolving
the
problem
of
a
failed
business
than
as
congress
recognized,
first
to
reassemble
the
assets
and
then
to
distribute
them.
indeed,
in
1983
in
a
unanimous
decision
called
u.s.
v.
whiting
pools,
this
court
stressed
that
congress
in
the
1978
act,
which
in
this
respect
hasn't
changed,
was
eager
to
make
sure
that
the
trustee
would
be
able
to
get
a
turnover
order
for
property
that
ought
to
have
been
in
the
possession
of
the
estate,
whether
it
happens
to
be
now
in
the
possession
of
a
custodian
and
therefore
reachable
under
543,
or
whether
it
is
out
of
the
estate
because
of
a
preferential
transfer
and
therefore
reachable
under
547,
or
as
a
result
of
a
fraudulent
conveyance
and
thereby
reachable
under
548.
mr.
laurence
tribe
well
the...
the
court
in
bombola
suggested
in
dictum
that
if
you
were
in
an
article
i
ordinary
territorial
court...
and
in
pernell
it
held
that
in
a
district
of
columbia
court,
as
long
as
it's
an
ordinary
court
of
law,
the
seventh
amendment
right
may
apply
although
the
court
has
never
settled
on
whether
you
can
ever
have
a
seventh
amendment
right
clearly
in
something
that
is
an...
is
nothing
like
an
article
iii
court
without
life
tenure.
but
the
two
inquiries
are
really
quite
different.
that
is,
in
cases
like
katchen,
there
was
no
question
that
article
iii
was
complied
with.
the
question
was
whether
the
seventh
amendment
is
complied
with.
it
is
also
quite
possible
to
violate
the...
violate
article
iii
while
providing
a
jury
trial.
the
whole
point
in
marathon
is
that
one
of
the
tasks
that
perhaps
should
not
have
been
given
to
these
article
i
bankruptcy
referees
was
the
task
of
presiding
over
a
jury
trial
so
that
the
two
issues
are
quite
separate.
but
in
this
case,
we
have
really
both
elements.
we
have
a
forum
that
does
not
use
and
has
not
traditionally,
historically
used
juries
as
its
fact-finding
arm.
under
the
rules
applicable
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
as
justice
kennedy
says,
there
was
no
provision
for
a
jury
trial.
so,
what
they're
really
asking
for
through
the
back
door
is
a
reference
back
to
the
district
court,
exactly
the
same
kind
of
dismemberment
of
the
statutory
scheme
that
the
court
objected
to
in
katchen.
and
in
katchen
it
is
true--
mr.
laurence
tribe
--well,
there
was
some
dismemberment
i
think
in
marathon,
but
it
was
a
very
different
kind
of
case,
a
garden
variety
contract
action
created
by
state
law.
and
whether
or
not
the
refinements
of
marathon
in
cftc
v.
schor
and
thomas
v.
union
carbide
leave
that
in
place
is
unclear.
but
what
does
seem
clear
is
that
the
restructuring
of
debtor/creditor
relations
which
the
supreme
court
ever
since
barton
v.
barbour
in
1881
has
recognized
as
a
central
exercise
of
congressional
power
to
put
matters
in
the
specialized
authority
of
a
special
tribunal
that
does
collective
justice
and
not
necessarily
piecemeal
justice...
what
is
clear
is
that
that
i
think
does
not
raise
grave
article
iii
questions
even
if
the
issue
had
been
properly
preserved
here,
which
it
is
not.
but
if
we
are
right
that,
for
example,
in
katchen
it
was
within
the
power
of
the
congress,
despite
the
1898
scheme
that
was
at
issue
in
schoenthal...
within
the
power
of
congress
to
force
a
creditor
to
submit
the
preference
claims,
as
well
as
his
own
claim
as
a
creditor,
to
non-jury
resolution,
we
don't
think
that
it
would
make
any
sense
to
read
the
seventh
amendment
to
point
to
a
different
result
when
one
is
a
fraudulent
transferee
rather
than
the
recipient
of
a
preferential
payment
as
a
creditor.
that
is,
the
two
go
hand
in
hand.
indeed,
one
of
the
more
remarkable
things
is
that
the
petitioners
in
their
brief
at
page
12
and
again
in
the
oral
argument
stress
that
for
seventh
amendment
purposes
there
is
no
justification
for
treating
differently
the
situation
of
a
preferential
transfer
or
the
situation
of
a
fraudulent
conveyance.
they
make
the
point...
and
i
think
it's
quite
right,
and
it
has
been
recognized
all
the
way
back
to
chancellor
kent
and
to
justice
story...
that
the
basic
policy
of
nondiscriminatory
distribution
that
underlies
the
bankruptcy
law
is
equally
frustrated...
the
basic
public
purposes
of
the
bankruptcy
law
equally
frustrated
by
both
kinds
of
transfer.
and
therefore,
the
constitutional
power
of
congress
to
place
in
the
hands
of
a
specialized
non-jury
utilizing
tribunal
the
authority
to
undo
the
eve-of-calamity
wrongs
that
were
done
is
really
coextensive
with
respect
to
the
kind
of
preferential
treatment
of
a
favored
creditor
that
was
involved
in
katchen
and
the
kind
of
out-and-out
gift,
as
it
were,
that's
involved
in...
in
this
case.
in
fact,
it's
quite
interesting
to
take
a
historical
perspective.
in
all
of
the
bankruptcy
laws
congress
has
passed,
it
has
never
distinguished
for
purposes
of
whether
something
falls
within
the
central
bankruptcy
process
or
whether
one
must
bring
a
plenary
action...
it
has
never
distinguished
preferential
transfer
claims
from
fraudulent
conveyances.
that
is,
during
the
1890...
under
the
1898
regime
in
both
of
these
cases,
there
was
a
requirement
by
statute
that
you
go
to
the
law
side
of
an
ordinary
court
and
bring
a
lawsuit
as
the
trustee
although
i
think
a
careful
reading
of
the
statutes
of
1800
and
1841
and
1867
suggests
that
that
was
not
always
so.
but
congress
has
never
created
the
anomaly
that
the
petitioners'
reading
of
katchen
would
create,
an
anomaly
which
says
that
you
have
a
seventh
amendment
right
to
a
jury
trial
if
you
simply
receive
a
completely
unjustified,
under-the-table
payment
on
the
eve
of
bankruptcy,
but
no
seventh
amendment
right
to
jury
trial
if
you
are
a
creditor
and
must
go
into
bankruptcy
in
order
to
collect
the
remainder
of
the
debt,
part
of
which
was
preferentially
paid
on
the
eve
of
bankruptcy.
it
would
make
no
sense
in
terms
of
the
bankruptcy
clause
or
the
seventh
amendment
to
reach
any
such
conclusion.
but
let
me
suppose
for
the
moment,
to
go
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question...
let
me
suppose
that
we
were
in
the
district
court
and
we
didn't
have
any
additional
mileage
out
of
the
fact
that
this
was
decided
by
a
specialized
tribunal
of
the
sort,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
in
your
park
lane
dissent
you
stressed
congress
could
set
up,
despite
the
seventh
amendment,
to
resolve
bankruptcy
and
other
kinds
of
special
claims.
suppose
we
were
in
the
district
court.
and
suppose
we
did
not
want
to
make
the
existence
of
a
seventh
amendment
right
to
jury
trial
turn
on
the
decision
of
the
district
court
to
refer
the
matter
for
final
decision
to
an
article
i
body.
even
there
it
is
simply
not
the
case,
as
the
petitioners
suggest,
that
an
action
to
recover
a
fraudulent
transfer
is
somehow
inherently
legal
and
therefore
jury
triable.
in
their
brief,
they
make
the
following
quite
remarkable
statement
about
late
18th
century
english
law.
they
say
equity
would
not
entertain
an
action
for
the
return
of
fraudulently
transferred
money
or
goods,
and
they
cite
principally
two
cases:
hobbs
from
1788
and
scudamore
from
1796.
and
what's
remarkable
about
those
cases
is
they
show
the
very
opposite.
in
those
cases
the
chancellor
said
equity
will
entertain
such
actions
if
it's
equitable
to
do
so.
and
in
both
cases
on
the
facts
the
chancellor
sent
the
creditor
to
the
law
side
saying
it
would
not
be
equitable
in
this
particular
case
to
grant
that
relief.
that's
why
judge
friendly--
mr.
laurence
tribe
--certainly.
mr.
laurence
tribe
well,
in
the
regime--
mr.
laurence
tribe
--pre-1938,
justice
stevens,
before
law
and
equity
merged
in
the
federal
district
courts,
and
certainly
under
section
267
of
the
judicial
code
which
was
in
force
at
the
time
of
schoenthal--
mr.
laurence
tribe
--schoenthal...
there
was
a
kind
of
preference
for
law.
and
congress
has
a
right
to--
mr.
laurence
tribe
--in
that
case
a
statutory
rule.
and
when--
mr.
laurence
tribe
--well,
the...
under
the
statutes
of
elizabeth
going
back
to
1571,
the
fraudulent
conveyance
situation
was
much
more,
should
i
say,
agnostic
on
the
ordinary
choice.
that
is,
in
most
areas
it
is
true
that
in
the
choice
between
law
and
equity,
there
was
an
overwhelming
preference
for
law
with
equity
being
seen
as
a
last
resort.
but
the
observation
was
made
by
chancellor
kent,
quoted
then
by
justice
story
in
1836,
that
when
it
comes
to
fraudulent
conveyances,
since
it
may
so
often
be
the
case
that
an
execution
at
law
will
not
quite
do,
there
ought
to
be
a
generally
available
equitable
remedy
to
order
a
return
of
the
assets
or
of
the
property.
and
even
though
there
is
some
historical
dispute
about
the
various
periods
in
which
the
preferences
went
one
way
or
the
other,
what
is
clear
is
that
in
section
550
of
the
bankruptcy
code
and
in
551,
congress
in
codifying
the
law
with
respect
to
fraudulent
conveyances
did
not
put
the
preference
on
the
law
side.
it
said
that
you
should
get
a
turnover
order
or,
if
necessary,
an
award
in
the
amount
of
value
involved.
mr.
laurence
tribe
it's
current
analogue.
i
don'
t
know
what
the
number
is,
but
it's
still
in
effect.
when
you
seek
an
injunction,
for
example,
you
have
to
show
that
there
is
no
adequate
legal
remedy.
but
under
the
substantive
statutes
governing
bankruptcy,
if
you
seek
a
turnover
of
property,
you
do
not
have
to
show
that
money
might
not
do.
in
this
case
the
reason
the
decree
was
as
broad
as
it
was
and
the
reason
it
said
shall
turn
over
the
$1.7
million
is
that,
of
course,
granfinanciera
and
medex
commingled
the
assets.
it
would
have
been
pointless
to
insist,
as
i
guess,
justice
scalia,
you
suggested
in...
in
a...
in
a
footnote
in
bowen
v.
mass,
maybe
these
were
peculiar
coins
or
something
and
you
really
need
these
very
ones
back
and
therefore
law
won't
do.
the
regime
in
fraudulent
conveyance
law
doesn't
operate
in
that
way.
the
regime
in
fraudulent
conveyance
law,
going
back
to
1571,
did
not
have
the
requirement
that
when
you
want
to
return
something
to
the
res
or
to
the
estate,
that
you
show
that
money
won't
be
sufficient.
but
in
any
event
that
wouldn't
be
a
fruitful
inquiry
here
because
it
is
the
duty
of
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
ultimately
in
a
situation
like
this
where
it
is
a
liquidating
trustee
to
reduce
everything
to
money.
and
what
i
think
is
happening
is
that
the
petitioners
are
engaged
in
a
kind
of
play
on
words.
they
are
suggesting
that
because
one
couldn't
find
the
particular
wire
transfer
that
had
gone
to
granfinanciera
or
the
particular
checks
that
had
gone
to
medex
that
it,
therefore,
follows
that
because
one
was
ordering
restitution
of
money,
that
that
was
the
same
as
money
damages.
now,
there
may
be
some
contexts
as
the
dissenters,
the
three
dissenters
in
bowen
v.
massachusetts,
suggested
where
the
play
on
words
is
the
other
way
and
where
it's
just
a
cute
thing
to
describe
something
as
restitution
where
really
one
is
getting
the
payment
of
a
past
due
sum,
as
you
suggested
in
that
case,
justice
scalia.
but
here
it
is
as
clear
as
anything
could
be
that
the
respondent
was
not
asking
for
the
payment
of
a
past
due
sum.
the
respondent
was
asking
for
a
restoration
of
the
status
quo,
for
a
reversal
of
an
improper
eve-of-bankruptcy
transfer
that
ought
never
to
have
occurred.
mr.
laurence
tribe
well,
i
suppose
the
ultimate
decision
by
the
bankruptcy
judge
in
april
of
1986
to
fashion
the
remedy
as
he
did
and
not
to
issue
or
to
refer
the
matter
back
to
the
district
court
so
that
it
could
issue
an
injunction
did
rest
on
the
bankruptcy
judge's
factual
determination
of
what
was
practical.
mr.
laurence
tribe
certainly,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
don't
intend
to
bootstrap
anything
on
what
we
know
after
the
fact,
but
it
is
the
case
that
the
underlying
nature
of
the
action,
both
the
remedy
sought
and
the
nature
of
the
action,
focus
on
an
attempt
to
get
back
what
you
allege
was
wrongly
taken
from
an
estate
that
ought
not
to
have
been
dismembered
piecemeal
on
the
eve
of
bankruptcy.
of
course,
if
that
allegation
is
rejected,
and
if
all
you
have
left
is
a
claim
that
somehow
the
way
you
were
treated
caused
damage,
that
would
be
an
ordinary
legal
claim
to
which
the
jury
trial
right
might
attach.
but
i'm
suggesting
that
independent
of
the
forum
that
an
attempt
under
the
statutes
of
elizabeth
or
their
successors
to...
to
reverse
a
fraudulent
transfer
has
long
been
treated
as
cognizable
in
equity.
let
me
just
say--
mr.
laurence
tribe
--sure.
mr.
laurence
tribe
no,
no,
justice
stevens.
mr.
laurence
tribe
that
is...
the
point
really
is
that
unlike
some
other
cases
where
one
is
using
a
sort
of
an
equitable
request
as
a
way
of
circumventing
a
jury
trial...
take
beacon
theaters
or
dairy
queen
or
ross
v.
bernhard
where
a
trick
of
pleading
and
of
sequencing
evades
jury
trial.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that's
not
involved
here.
the
decision
to
commingle
was
granfinanciera
and
medex'
decision,
not
that
of
the
trustee
or
of
the
bankrupt
corporation.
the
fact,
in
other
words,
that
predictably
in
a
case
of
this
kind
one
might
be
able
at
best
to
get
the
equivalent
value
should
not
be
a
reason
to
treat
this
as
a
legal
action
in
disguise.
mr.
laurence
tribe
actually,
justice
stevens,
the
way
the
chancellor
analyzed
the
matter
in
hobbs
in
particular
doesn't
confirm
that.
what
the
chancellor
in
hobbs
said
was
that
there
would
be
peculiar
hardships
attending
an
equitable
decree
and
therefore
you
ought
to
go
to
law.
that's
why
judge
friendly
in
damsky
v.
zavatt
in
1981
cited
the
hobbs
case
which
the
petitioners
use
to
prove
that
an
action
will
not
lie
in
equity,
cited
it
to
precisely
the
opposite
effect
to
show
that
an
action
to
avoid
a
fraudulent
conveyance
and
to
rescind
it
is
quintessentially
equitable
in
character
even
if
in
the
end
the
particular
relief
has
to
be
dollars.
in
katchen,
this
court
said
that
equity
courts
generally
have
power
to
decree
complete
relief
and
for
that
purpose
may
accord
what
would
otherwise
be
legal
remedies.
that's
really
all
we
have
here
with
the
fact
that
it
was
an
award
of
a
specific
amount
of
money
so
that
it's
stretching
a
great
deal
to
treat
this
as
an
action
at
law.
it's
stretching
even
more
to
treat
this
command
to
disgorge
as
though
it
were
somehow
a
legal
rather
than
an
equitable
remedy.
and
every
circuit
that
has
construed
the
matter
has
seen
turnover
orders
as
essentially
injunctive,
enforceable
in
appropriate
cases
by
contempt
if
one
has
personal
jurisdiction.
and
so
the
fact
that
in
this
particular
case
what
one
has
is
a
judgment
for
money
does
not
make
it
an
action
at
law.
mr.
laurence
tribe
that's
right
although
sometimes
bank
accounts
have
been
subject
to
them.
mr.
laurence
tribe
but
it
seems
to
us
that
there
are
two
independent
reasons
apart
from
the
nationalization
of
granfinanciera,
which
as
to
that
petitioner,
pretty
clearly
eliminates
a
right
to
jury
trial...
two
independent
reasons
for
saying
that
the
effort
by
congress
to
comply
with
marathon,
whatever
else
may
be
said
about
it,
did
not
violate
the
seventh
amendment
either
on
its
face
or
as
applied
in
this
case.
and
we,
therefore,
believe
that
the
judgment
which
was
entered
against
the
petitioners,
not
by
an
article
iii
court
which
affirmed
the
bankruptcy
judge's
decree,
but
by
a
specialized
bankruptcy
tribunal
is
not
infirm
on
the
ground
that
they
were
denied
a
jury
which,
by
the
way,
they
would
never
have
been
able
to
claim
had
they
been
in
the
more
equitable
position
of
a
creditor.
thank
you.
