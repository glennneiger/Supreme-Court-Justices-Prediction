mr.
payton,
can
i
interrupt
you
there?
is
that
a
correct
statement
that
only
two-thirds
of
one
percent
went
to
minority
business
enterprises?
what
about
the
subcontractors?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
clear
up
one
thing,
though?
the
ordinance
does
not
require
that
the
sub
be
a
richmond
concern,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
does
not.

but
if
out-of-state
materials,
the
items
involved
here
could
have
been
purchased
out
of
state,
presumably,
from
a
minority
business
enterprise
in
baltimore,
or
north
dakota,
or
some
place.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
before
the
city
council
does
show
that
the
city
is
approximately
50
percent
black
and
50
percent
white.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
said
exclusion
from
the
marketplace.
but
even
the
30
percent
figure,
according
to
your
opponent,
really
is
only
three
percent
of
the
market.
