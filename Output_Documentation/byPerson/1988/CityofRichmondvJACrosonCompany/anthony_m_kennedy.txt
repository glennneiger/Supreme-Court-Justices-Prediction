justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
this
case,
the
old
from
the
minority
subcontractor
was
some
$7,000
over
the
quotes
that
the
prime
had
received
from
other
suppliers.
is
it
the
most
narrowly
tailored
remedy
for
correcting
past
discrimination?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
to
permit
an
increased
price,
and
require
that
the
increased
price
be
paid,
without
a
waiver?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
it
a
requirement
then
for
the
validity
of
an
ordinance
with
such
an
escalation
mechanism
that
the
city
absorb
the
excess?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
a
requirement
for
the
validity
of
the
ordinance?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
the
costs
of
during
past
discrimination
can
rest
on
a
third
party?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
the
competitive
forces
were
not
operating,
and
minority
subcontracting
was
at
a
premium
borne
by
the
prime
contractor,
that
would
still
not
impair
the
validity
of
the
ordinance?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
i
understand
your
answers,
you
want
us
to
consider
this
case
as
if
the
minority
contractor
did
not
make
a
higher
bid?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that's
how
we
evaluate
this
record,
and
this
case,
and
this
ordinance?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
croson's
damages
aren't...
i
take
it
are
based
on
the
loss
of
the
contract.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
must
infer
from
what
you
have
told
us,
i
take
it,
that
if
the...
if
croson
had
absorbed
the
$7,000
himself,
he
would
have
received
the
contract?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
because
of
his
refusal
to
absorb
it,
he
did
not
get
the
contract.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
city's
aware
that
a
private
contractor
is
discriminating,
may
it
continue
to
deal
with
that
contractor?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
this
ordinance
had
been
enacted
in
the
year
1870,
would
the
chances
for
its
being
sustained
be
any
greater
than
now?
that's
two
years
after
the
enactment
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we
know
about
our
history,
we
know
about
the
context
of
the
time,
we
know
about
slavery,
we
know
about
the
necessity
for
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
we
know
about
the
existence
(a),
of
slavery,
and
(b),
of
discrimination
after
slavery
ended.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
think
it's
unlikely
that
this
ordinance
could
have
been
sustained
in
1870,
when
blacks
had
been
emancipated
for
simply,
approximately
six
years?
