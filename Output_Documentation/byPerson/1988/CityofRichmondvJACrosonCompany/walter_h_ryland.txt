mr.
walter
h.
ryland
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
responding
to
the
last
question
which
was
asked
of
mr.
payton,
on
the
question
of
whether
the
city
would
absorb
the
higher
bid
by
the
minority
supplier
in
this
case,
the
record
is
quite
explicit
that
j.
a.
croson
company
asked
the
city
to
do
just
that,
and
was
refused
by
the
city,
on
grounds
that
the
bid
could
not
be
increased.
the
price
could
not
be
increased
after
the
bids
were
in.
mr.
walter
h.
ryland
the
city
then
announced
that
because
of
croson's
noncompliance
with
the
ordinance,
the
contract
would
be
re-bid.
mr.
walter
h.
ryland
i
think
the
threshold
question
which
we
attack
is
whether
the
council
had
a
proper
basis
for
adopting
the
ordinance
in
the
first
place.
we
did
argue
that--
mr.
walter
h.
ryland
--it's
facial
in
the
sense
that
we
attack
the
authority
to
adopt
the
ordinance.
it's
not
a
facial
challenge
in
that
it's--
mr.
walter
h.
ryland
--we're
not
contending
that
the
ordinance
could
not
be
constitutionally
applied
in
some
circumstance.
mr.
walter
h.
ryland
we're
contending
that
in
this
particular
case,
the
city
had
no
authority
to
adopt
it.
it
had
no--
mr.
walter
h.
ryland
--yes.
mr.
walter
h.
ryland
yes.
mr.
walter
h.
ryland
it's
only
because
of
his
refusal
to
absorb
it
that
he
did
not
get
the
contract.
mr.
walter
h.
ryland
essentially,
what
we
have
here
is
a
conclusion
by
the
city
that
because
prime
contracts
were
being
awarded
to
minority
businesses
in
a
low
number,
that
this
justified
the
adoption
of
a
race-conscious
legal
remedy
to
correct
the
situation.
in
effect,
it
was
determined
that
because
of
the
low
percentage
of
awards
to
minority
firms,
the
construction
industry
would
be
required
to
remedy
the
situation
by
having
those
contractors
who
were
owned
by
non-minorities
contract
30
percent
of
their
contracts
to
minority
firms.
there
was
no
finding
by
the
city,
no
evidence
before
city
council
which
would
entitle
city
council
to
infer
that
this
societal
discrimination
should
be
remedied
by
the
adoption
of
such
a
racial
classification.
our
position
is
that
if
city
council
wanted
to
attack
societal
discrimination,
they
could
do
it
by
adopting
various
means,
race-neutral
means
on
their
face.
the
city
council
had
an
ordinance
which
prohibited
discrimination
in
the
award
of
public
contracts.
it
could
have
exercised
its
authority
under
that
ordinance,
and
put
the
effort
into
enforcing
that
ordinance,
that
it
put
into
administering
this
one,
and
achieved
a
constitutional
result.
mr.
walter
h.
ryland
no,
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
before
city
council
was
quite
explicit
in
rejecting
any
contention
that
the
city
had
discriminated
in
any
way.
clearly,
no
court
could
force
the
adoption
of
a
law
like
richmond's,
unless
the
city
itself
had
been
guilty
of
discrimination
against
the
groups
identified
in
the
ordinance.
when
a
city
voluntarily
adopts
a
racial
preference,
it
should
be
looked
at
very
carefully.
the
city
is
more
likely
to...
more
likely
than
a
court
to
be
acting
for
a
purpose
not
permitted
by
the
constitution.
this
is
different
from
the
situation
in
fullilove,
where
this
court
gave
proper
deference
to
the
findings
of
congress
that
it
was
acting
for
remedial
purposes.
here
we
have
an
action
by
a
locality,
and
the
record
before
the
court
shows
quite
clearly
that
the
reason
they
were
adopting
the
ordinance
was
that
other
cities
had
it.
that
was
the
testimony
at
the
hearing
before
city
council.
mr.
walter
h.
ryland
not
necessarily.
i
think
that
if
the
congress
says
it's
acting
for
remedial
purpose,
because
of
the
breadth
of
the
national
government
and
the
breadth
of
national
problems
that
it's
seeking
to
deal
with,
that
finding
inherently
has
more
credibility
than
the
unsupported
action
of
a
local
government
in
adopting
what
would
be
a
mere
pork
barrel
political
dispensation
of
public
money.
mr.
walter
h.
ryland
it
might
be,
but
it's
less
likely
to
be.
mr.
walter
h.
ryland
you
mean
whether--
mr.
walter
h.
ryland
--i
don't
think
that
there
is
anything
in
the
record
per
se
which
talks
about
the
minority
percentage
in
the
area.
it
was
assumed
for
purposes
of
discussion
that
it
was
approximately
50
percent.
is--
mr.
walter
h.
ryland
--yes,
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
filed
some
census
data
which
showed
that
the
actual
minority
percentage
in
richmond
was
more
than
50
percent.
it
was
known
that
a
majority
of
the
people
on
city
council
were
black.
we
have
not
chosen
to
make
an
issue
of
that
because
of
one
of
those
decisions
that
lawyers
make
in
representing
a
case.
essentially,
it
seemed
to
us
that
the
tendency
to
adopt
an
ordinance
for
the
wrong
reason
would
be
there
any
time
you
were
dealing
with
a
significant
political
interest
group,
without
regard
to
whether
it
was
in
the
majority
or
not.
so
we
decided
not
to
attach
legal
significance
to
the
fact
that
they
had
a
majority
vote
or
council
and
perhaps
had
a
majority
in
the
population.
mr.
walter
h.
ryland
yes,
that's
in
the
transcript.
the
fact
that
the
population
was
approximately
50
percent
black
was
used
in
the
explanation
of
why
the
city
chose
the
30
percent
number.
and
i
submit
that
that's
no
justification
for
choosing
that
number,
but
that
was
the
explanation
given
for
why
it
was
chosen.
mr.
walter
h.
ryland
yes.
mr.
walter
h.
ryland
no,
i
would
not
take
that
position.
i
would
think
that's
a
different
situation,
when
there
is,
where
there
is
known
discrimination,
as
opposed
to
the
unidentified,
amorphous
concept
that
there
is
discrimination
out
there
somewhere
by
somebody.
in
a
specific
case
of
known
discrimination,
i
would--
mr.
walter
h.
ryland
--by
a
private
party.
mr.
walter
h.
ryland
yes,
i
would
not--
mr.
walter
h.
ryland
--in
proper
circumstances,
yes.
mr.
walter
h.
ryland
well,
in...
before
the
court
below,
there
was
no
identified
discrimination
for
the
court
to
address.
the
court
was
only
addressing--
mr.
walter
h.
ryland
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
walter
h.
ryland
well,
i
think
the
root
of
that
language
comes
from
the
reference
in
mygant,
in
the
plurality
opinion
to
remedying
discrimination
by
the
governing
body.
mr.
walter
h.
ryland
it's
a
plurality
opinion.
and
the
reference
is
in
the
context
of
this
court
never
having
approved
a
race-conscious
legal
remedy
by
a
state
actor
in
the
absence
of
discrimination
by
that
actor.
mr.
walter
h.
ryland
yes.
mr.
walter
h.
ryland
yes.
if
it
identified--
mr.
walter
h.
ryland
--precisely.
precisely.
we
don't
take
issue
with
the
city's
authority
to
act
affirmatively
in
an
identified
case.
mr.
walter
h.
ryland
if
it
were
aware
of
the
discrimination,
and
were
aware
that
its
continuing
to
deal
with
the
contractor
would
further
that
discrimination,
i
think
the
city
would
be
exposing
itself
to
liability.
i
think
it
could
continue
to
deal
with
the
contractor,
but
at
its
peril.
mr.
walter
h.
ryland
i
don't
believe
so.
i
don't
think
that
we
have
any
identified
instances
of
discrimination
by
any
entity
against
minority
firms.
i
think
that
the
accusation
that
there
is
discrimination
in
the
construction
industry
does
not
extend
to
the
award
of
relief
against
the
industry
or
any
particular
firms
because
of
that
general
finding.
mr.
walter
h.
ryland
i
understand.
i
don't
feel
competent
to
answer
that,
justice
kennedy,
because
i
don't
know
the
context
of
the
time
and
what
the
courts
would
have
done.
mr.
walter
h.
ryland
yes.
you
had
the
freedman's
bureau,
which
was
established
at
that
time
specifically
to
provide
aid
to
former
slaves.
nobody
has
ever
suggested
that
that
was
unconstitutional
or
some
sort
of
unlawful
preference.
congress
was
struggling
with
the
powers
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
think
that
under
the
line
of
cases
since
brown
v.
board
of
education,
we
do
not
find
this
court
approving
race-conscious
legal
remedies
in
the
absence
of
a
shown
violation.
so,
i
would
have
to
answer
that
based
on
recent
constitutional
history,
the
rule
should
have
been
the
same
in
1870.
mr.
walter
h.
ryland
well,
you
would
have
had
a
different
factual
situation
in
that
regard.
certainly
the
government
would
have
been
entitled
to
provide
aid
to
former
slaves
to
help
them
become
skilled
tradesmen,
craftsmen,
contractors
able
to
stand
on
their
own
in
the
business
world.
there's
no
question
about
that.
for
the
government
to
have
said
to
white
businessmen
who
were
not
former
slaveowners
that
they
had
to
provide
the
remedy
to
slavery,
i
think,
raises
a
very
different
constitutional
question.
i'm
uncomfortable
dealing
with
this
in
the
abstract,
because
there
are
so
many
variables
in
there.
but
i
don't
think
we
had
any
remedies
in
the
post-civil
war
period
that
imposed
affirmative
duty
on
non-violators,
so
that's
the
distinction
we
make
in
this
case.
a
second
aspect
of
our
position
is
that
this
ordinance
was
not
narrowly
tailored
to
achieve
a
proper
remedial
objection.
we've
mentioned
the
fact
that
the
30
percent
quota
was
pulled
out
of
the
air.
the
fact
that
it's
over
inclusive
and
that
it
grants
preferential
rights
to
groups
that
are
not
resident
in
the
richmond
area,
and
which
have
never
been
subject
to
discrimination
in
the
richmond
area,
would
automatically
give
rise
to
a
constitutional
violation
as
soon
as
one
of
these
minority
group
members
exercised
its
right
to
preferential
treatment
under
the
richmond
ordinance.
it's
not
enough
to
dismiss
the
seriousness
of
the
problem
by
saying
none
of
these
groups
have
participated
yet.
under
this
law,
there's
nothing
to
prevent
qualified
and
competent
minority
firms
from
areas
of
the
country
which
have
not
experienced
discrimination
to
come
into
the
richmond
area
and
participate
under
the
ordinance.
there's
no
real
supervision
of
the
administration
of
the
ordinance
to
assure
that
it
achieves
a
business
purpose.
the
30
percent
quota
requirement
has
a
problem
in
it,
in
that
it's
so
high
that
it
can
force
the
award
of
a
much
higher
proportion
of
the
contract
to
minority
firms.
this
has
a
serious
impact
on
non-minority
subcontractors
who
are
in
the
same
trades
where
there
are
qualified
minority
firms
already
participating.
the
impact
on
those
people
can
be
exclusion
from
the
marketplace,
and
the
impact
on
them
is
as
great
as
the
impact
on
croson,
with
the
loss
of
its
contract
in
this
case.
mr.
walter
h.
ryland
i
could
not
make
the
argument
that
it
would
force
the
award
of
a
much
larger
percentage.
mr.
walter
h.
ryland
yes,
yes,
a
constitutional
violation
is
a
constitutional
violation,
whether
it's
a
little
one
or
a
big
one.
mr.
walter
h.
ryland
yes.
mr.
walter
h.
ryland
the
figure
is
meaningless
on
the
down
side.
the
higher
it
gets,
the
more
practical
problems
result.
mr.
walter
h.
ryland
it's
three
percent
of
the
market,
by
that
computation,
but
for
the
individual
subcontractor
who
is
in
competition
with
one
eligible
for
the
minority
preference,
on
him
that
three
percent
is
a
much
larger
proportion
of
his
business.
and
let
us
not
forget
that
the
subcontractors
who
are
competing
for
these
jobs
are
not
all
large,
wealthy
firms.
the
subcontractors
struggle
without
regard
to
race.
there
are
many
tradesmen
out
there
who
would
like
to
be
a
prime
contractor
with
a
governmental
entity
but
don't
have
the
expertise
or
the
skill
and
never
will.
and
that's
without
regard
to
race.
there
are
a
lot
of
struggling
business
cut
there,
so
any
time
you
adopt
a
law
which
has
the
effect
of
denying
a
substantial
part
of
the
market...
of
their
market...
to
them,
the
impact
is
quite
severe.
thank
you.
