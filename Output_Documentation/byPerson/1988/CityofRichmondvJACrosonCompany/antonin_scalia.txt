do
you
mean
the
commerce
power
wouldn't
have
handled
it?
i
would
have
thought
you
could
do
almost
anything
under
the
commerce
clause.
we
had
to
mention
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
we
would
have
thought,
"my
goodness,
this
is
not
one
of
those
areas
that
the
federal
government
can
get
into.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
know
what
you're
driving
at.
is
it
clear
from
the
record
in
this
case
that
we
are
dealing
with
the
majority
favoring
the
minority
in
the
particular
political
unit?
we've
been
talking
about
minority
contractors.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
these
people...
do
we
know
from
the
record
that
they
are
in
fact
a
minority
of
the
political
unit
that
adopted
this
race-based
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
that
we
might
take
a
different
view
of
race-based
matters
where
the
political
unit
is
favoring
a
race
that's
the
minority,
as
opposed
to
what
is
the
case,
where
a
political
unit
favors
a
race
that
is
the
majority?
