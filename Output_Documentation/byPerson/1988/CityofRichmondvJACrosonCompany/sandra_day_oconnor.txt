justice

day
o'connor
--mr.
payton,
some
of
the
cities
concerned
seem
to
be
with
impediments
to
minority
participation,
such
as
complicated
bidding
procedures
and
lack
of
capital
and
bonding
requirements
and
so
forth.
is
there
any
indication
that
the
city
considered
any
race-neutral
alternatives
before
enacting
a
percentage
set-aside
requirement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
we
don't
know
what
the
figures
were
on
subcontractors,
as
your
response
to
justice
stevens
pointed
out.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
the...
now,
the
ordinance
supplied
also,
in
addition
to
blacks,
to
orientals,
indians
and
aleut
persons?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
was
there
evidence
before
the
city
that
they
had
been
subject
to
discrimination
in
the
richmond
construction
industry,
do
you
know?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
think
with
the
absence
of
all
such
evidence
that
the
ordinance
is
valid
as
to
those
groups?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
although
richmond
had
not
tried
any
of
those
other
race-neutral
alternatives,
i
take
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you're
saying
congress
had
not,
or...
but
i
guess
richmond--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--do
you
think
that
state
and
local
government
have
as
much
authority
and
power
to
act
in
this
area
as
congress
does,
with
its
express
grant
of
authority
under
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
although
in
a
sense,
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
precisely
designed
to
prohibit
states
from
taking
action
on
the
basis
of
race,
wasn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
ryland,
are
you...
do
you
think
that
the
city
can
only
act
affirmatively
on
the
basis
of
remedying
its
own
prior
discrimination?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
that
if
the
city
had
evidence
that
in
fact
private
construction
contractors
were
indeed
discriminating
against
minorities,
that
the
city
would
be
powerless
to
take
action
to
remedy
that
private
discrimination?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
by
private--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--parties,
against
others.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
do
concede
that
the
city
would
then
have
the
power
to
try
to
remedy
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
that
was
not
the
view
taken
by
the
court
below,
was
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
by
either
the
city
or
private
parties,
is
that
your
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
there
certainly
was
language
in
the
opinion
to
the
effect
that
the
city
would
be
powerless
to
remedy
private
discrimination.
and
where
did
he
get
that
language,
do
you
know?
what's
the
root
of
it?
