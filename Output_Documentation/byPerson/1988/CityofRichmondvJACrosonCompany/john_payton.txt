mr.
john
payton
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
sole
issue
in
this
case
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
ordinance
enacted
by
the
appellant,
the
city
of
richmond,
to
remedy
the
effects
of
racial
discrimination
in
its
construction
industry.
that
ordinance,
the
minority
business
utilization
plan,
provided
that
with
respect
to
construction
contracts
with
the
city,
at
least
30
percent
of
the
dollar
amount
of
the
contract
must
go
to
minority
business
enterprises.
the
ordinance
was
designed
to
last
five
years,
and
contained
an
appropriate
waiver
provision.
by
enacting
this
ordinance,
richmond
was
attempting
to
address
one
of
the
most
difficult
problems
confronting
our
nation
and
its
cities
and
states.
identified
racial
discrimination
is
a
scourge
of
our
society.
richmond
focused
on
discrimination
in
the
construction
industry,
and
proceeded
to
try
to
remedy
that
discrimination.
aware
of
findings
of
the
congress
regarding
discrimination
nationwide
in
the
construction
industry,
and
of
this
court's
decision
in
fullilove,
upholding
federal
legislation
remedying
that
discrimination,
richmond
examined
its
own
construction
industry.
it
learned
that
from
1978
to
1983,
two-thirds
of
one
percent
of
its
construction
dollars
went
to
minority
businesses...
this
in
a
city
that
was
50
percent
black.
that
was
not
all
that
richmond
knew--
mr.
john
payton
--there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
with
regard
to
how
subcontracting
was
divided
up,
but
as
the
district
court
found,
there
is
no
reason
at
all
to
expect
that
the
subcontracting
would
have
gone
another
way.
in
fact,
when
congress
made
its
findings
with
respect
to
the
construction
industry,
it
found
that
the
construction
industry
is
an
industry
which
is
a
business
system
which
has
precluded
measurable
minority
participation.
and
the
way
that
occurred,
as
the
congress
identified
it,
was
by
first
of
all
having
formidable
racial
barriers
to
racial
entry
and
advancement.
the
barrier
to
entry
has
to
do
with
how
you
get
to
be
a
contractor.
the
barrier
to
advancement
has
to
do
with
what
the
congress
found,
and
what
this
court
also
noted
in
fullilove,
is
the
problem
of
racial
discrimination
in
the
relationship
between
prime
construction
contractors
and
their
subcontractors.
and
they
found
that
this
business
system
operates
in
the
following
way:
that
a
prime
contractor
often
does
business
over
and
over
again
with
the
same
group
of
subcontractors.
and
in
one
of
the
items
that
we
cite
in
our
brief,
glover,
minority
business...
minority
enterprise
in
construction,
that
is
a
study
which
noted
that
often
in
that
relationship,
prime
construction
contractors
and
their
subcontractors,
often
it's
impossible
to
break
in
by
minority
contractors,
even
when
they
have
the
low
bid.
that's
one
of
the
problems
that
arises.
so,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
says
exactly
what
the
racial
breakup
of
subcontracting
is,
but
the
evidence
with
regard
to
prime
contracting
is
stark
and
dramatic,
and
there
is
no
reason,
as
the
trial
court
found,
to
expect
it
to
be
any
different.
mr.
john
payton
the
ordinance
purported
to
remedy
the
fact
that
there
were
very
few
minority
contractors
in
the
construction
industry.
mr.
john
payton
yes.
the
means
that
richmond
chose
to
try
to
remedy
the
discrimination
that
it
identified
was
to
focus
on
a
remedy
that
was
both
modest
and
narrow.
and
the
narrow
focus
of
the
remedy
was
to
look
at
subcontracting.
and
the
reason
for
that,
is
that
i
think
that
everyone
would
agree,
that
it
is
easier
to
break
into
the
business
as
a
subcontractor,
and
break
into
this,
what
i
would
call
a
closed
business
system,
by
doing
work
with
prime
contractors.
and
the
design
of
this
program
was
that
by
doing
it
that
way,
by
having
a
remedy
that
focuses
on
subcontractors,
that
will
establish
relationships
between
majority
prime
contractors
and
minority
subcontractors.
it
will
establish
some
trust,
relationships,
experiences,
and
thereby
allow
an
expansion
of
the
list
of
subs
that
prime
contractors
would
be
doing
business
with.
mr.
john
payton
well,
the
city
was
well
aware
of
other
efforts,
especially
efforts
by
the
united
states
congress,
to
deal
with
this
problem.
the
problem
that
the
city
was
faced
with
wasn't
that
there
was
a
group
of
minority
contractors
out
there
who
were
simply
having
trouble
with
bonding
requirements
or
bidding
requirements...
not
to
say
that
those
aren't
problems,
but
they
are,
i
think,
secondary
problems.
the
problem
was
that
we
had
a
business
system
that
had
precluded
measurable
minority
participation.
the
number
two-thirds
of
one
percent
is
insignificant.
it's
close
to
zero.
mr.
john
payton
yes,
that's
correct.
and
what
the
city
was
doing
was
to
address
the
problem
of
the
two-thirds
of
one
percent
selecting
a
remedy
which
is
probably
the
best
remedy
to
address
that
problem.
mr.
john
payton
yes.
mr.
john
payton
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
with
regard
to
that.
mr.
john
payton
the
reason
the
description
of
minorities
that
exists
in
this
ordinance
is
there
is
that
it
is
the
same
description
of
minorities
the
exists
in
the
federal
program
in
fullilove,
and
in
fact,
it's
the
same
description
of
minorities
that
exists
in
the
virginia
code
that
defines
what
a
minority
business
enterprise
is.
i
don't
think
that
it
really
matters
that
much.
there's
no
showing
that
aleuts
or
some
of
the
other
groups
are
present
in
any
significant
numbers
in
richmond,
and
there's
certainly
no
claim
here
that
someone
lost
some
contract
because
of
an
aleut
getting
a
contract.
let
me
go
back
to
your
first
question,
though,
justice
o'connor,
with
regard
to
what
the
city
council
looked
at
when
it
was
considering
this.
this
is
not
a
problem
that
is
brand
new
on
the
stage
of
racial
problems.
it's
one
that
has
been
studied
and
studied,
and
there
have
been
a
lot
of
different
remedies
out
there.
and
i
guess
it's
important
to
realize
that
when
congress
looked
at
this,
when
it
enacted
the
1977
legislation
that
was
the
subject
of
fullilove,
congress
went
through
a
lot
of
other
remedies
that
had
been
designed
to
try
and
deal
with
this
problem,
including
laws
that
made
underlying
discrimination
unlawful,
including
executive
orders
like
executive
order
11246,
including
executive
orders
like
executive
order
11246,
including
special
efforts
by
various
departments
of
the
federal
government
to
try
to
assist
minority
contractors...
and
in
the
face
of
all
these
things,
richmond
also
had
its
own
anti-discrimination
city
code.
it
had
experience
with
these
federal
programs,
including
some
federal
programs
that
set
goals
that
applied
to
minority
contractors.
in
the
face
of
all
this,
when
they
looked
at
this
in
1983,
the
number
still
is
two-thirds
of
one
percent
of
its
construction
business.
so,
those
other
alternatives,
which
are
the
ones
that
are
normally
set
forth,
simply
weren't
working.
it
was
faced
with
a
problem
that
required
a
different
solution.
mr.
john
payton
well,
that's
not
exactly
right.
mr.
john
payton
that's
part
of
the
congressional
remedy.
in
fact,
the
design
of
the
statute
in
the
fullilove
case,
it's
designed
to
administer
funds
through
the
state's
two
localities.
richmond
was
familiar
with
how
these
programs
had
worked.
it's
a
beneficiary
of
a
lot
of
these
national
programs,
and
in
the
face
of
that,
it
knows
that
those
programs
certainly
didn't
affect
this
problem
that
it
saw,
and
that
it
sought
to
remedy.
mr.
john
payton
i
think
that
state
and
local
governments
have
greater
responsibility...
i'll
come
to
power
in
just
a
second.
i
think
they
have
a
greater
responsibility.
these
are
problems
that
are
very
difficult
to
solve.
we
haven't
come
up
with
magic
bullets
for
racism,
or
vaccinations
to
prevent
it,
and
localities
have
to
deal
with
these
problems
that
they
see
every
day
in
their
contracting
dollars,
for
example.
and
i
think
that
it's
not
possible
for
congress
to
come
up
with
remedies
that
affect
various
localities
in
ways
that
will
actually
deal
with
these
problems.
with
regard
to
power,
i
think
that
when
this
court
in
fullilove
made
reference
to
section
five
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
that
really
was
to
find
a
basis
for
the
congress
being
able
to
impose
a
program
on
the
states.
and
when
it
looked
to
whether
or
not
it
could
do
this
for
itself,
it
didn't
have
to
look
there.
so
i
think
section--
mr.
john
payton
--well,
you
may
be
right,
justice
scalia,
but
in
then
chief
justice
burger's
opinion,
he
made
explicit
reference
to
section
five
when
he
wanted
to
find
a
basis
for
power
for
the
congress
imposing
the
requirements
of
the
public
works
employment
act
on
the
states
and,
through
the
states,
on
their
subdivisions.
now,
that's
the
way
he
analyzed
it.
he
also
looked
at
the
commerce
power
for
other
parts
of
the
act.
that
may
or
may
not...
you
may
or
may
not
agree
with
him,
but
that
is
the
way
he
walked
through
the
analysis
in
fullilove.
and
i
would
say
that
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
states
and
cities
and
any
other
subdivision...
as
long
as
they
make
appropriate
findings
and
have
the
authority
under
state
law
to
do
what
they
do--
mr.
john
payton
--i
think
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
designed
in
a
way
to
require
states
to
treat
people
fairly.
and
i
think
this
court
has
dealt
in
the
past,
on
several
occasions,
with
whether
or
not
states
can
take
action
that
would
be
characterized
as
affirmative
action,
and
i
think
the
analysis
is,
there
are
disagreements
on
the
edges,
but
the
analysis
is,
if
there
is
a
sufficient
on
compelling
state
interest,
and
the
means
are
sufficiently
related
or
narrowly
tailored,
that
it
is
authorized
for
a
state
to
do
that,
and
for
the
state's
political
subdivisions
to
do
it
as
well.
richmond
satisfied
those
criteria.
mr.
john
payton
there
are...
there
is
something
to
that
effect
in
the
fullilove.
mr.
john
payton
yes.
there
are
later
congressional
actions,
including
the
surface
transportation
act
of
1988,
which
don't
have
such
explicit
requirements.
mr.
john
payton
there's
nothing
like
that.
mr.
john
payton
yes,
that
is
right.
i
think
there
are
two
responses,
though.
the
first
response
is
that
i
believe
the
jurisprudence
on
this
is
that
it
is
not
necessary,
or
is
not
a
fatal
defect,
if
a
plan
such
as
this
plan
is
overinclusive.
second,
given
what
we
learned
about
the
construction
industry,
the
number
of
contractors
that
you
are
talking
about
that
would
not
be
the
victims
of
the
past
discrimination
is
very
small,
if
at
all,
and
i
should
also
say
that
just
because
a
black
person
manages
to
be
a
contractor
in
the
face
of
this
system
doesn't
mean
that
he
is
not
a
victim.
that
there
are
clear
findings
that
there
are
other
obstacles
to
his
advancement,
and
that
in
some
sense,
because
of
how
stark
these
numbers
are,
i
would
say
it
is
fair
to
have
a
presumption
that
all
the
minority
contractors
were
in
some
sense--
mr.
john
payton
--it
is
not
exactly
like
fullilove.
mr.
john
payton
no,
it
was
not.
mr.
john
payton
it
was
not
reenacted.
mr.
john
payton
that's
correct.
mr.
john
payton
yes.
mr.
john
payton
the
30
percent
figure...
let
me
describe
the
reach
of
the
remedy,
here,
and
i
will
get
to
your
question
right
away,
justice
blackmun.
richmond's
share
of
the
construction
business,
the
city's
share
of
the
construction
business
in
richmond,
is
only
about
10
percent.
therefore,
even
if
the
30
percent
figure
is
a
complete
success,
that
would
only
have
an
impact
on
some
three
percent
of
the
construction
business.
where
did
the
30
percent
figure
come
from?
because
there
is
a
virtual
preclusion
of
minority
contractors
from
the
construction
industry,
it
isn't
possible
to
look
at
that
set
of
numbers
and
use
it.
therefore,
the
30
percent
figure
is
a
figure
that
is
simply
roughly
between
the
two-thirds
of
one
percent
and
fifty
percent.
that's
where
it
comes
from.
there
is
no
magic
formula
or
any
more
precise
way
of
coming
up
with
the
30
percent,
and
i
guess
in
looking
at
it,
it
is
fair
to
look
at
its
impact
on
the
entire
construction
industry,
which
i
represent
is
very
modest.
mr.
john
payton
well,
let
me--
mr.
john
payton
--there
are
two
points
to
this,
as
well.
i
think
that
the
record
does
not
support
the
proposition
that
the
minority
contractor's
bid
was
going
to...
would
have
been
higher
or
lower
or
the
same
as
the
majority
subcontractors's
bid.
this
is
what
is
in
the
record.
croson,
when
it
went
to
put
in
its
bid,
contacted
two
majority
subs
and
received
bids
back
from
them.
when
it
received
those
bids
back,
it
had
the
two
majority
subcontractors
engage
on
a
little
price
war
back
and
forth
among
themselves,
and
they
adjusted
their
bids
down,
down,
down,
until
they
got
the
lowest
bid,
and
then
they
put
in
that
lowest
bid.
when
croson
received
the
bid
from
the
minority
subcontractor,
after
the
bid
had
been
submitted,
it
received
that
bid.
it
was
higher
as
you
just
explained,
but
croson
never
sought
to
negotiate
with
the
minority
subcontractor
to
take
that
price
down,
as
it
had
with
the
majority
subcontractors.
so,
on
this
record,
we
don't
know
what
the
minority
price
would
have
been,
if
croson
had
engaged
in
the
negotiation
that
it
did
with
the
majority.
in
a
larger
sense,
though,
i
think
that
whether
the
price
is
higher
or
not
raises
no
real
constitutional
question
here.
it
is...
richmond
can
decide
if
it
wants
to
pay
more
money
in
order
to
achieve
a
remedy
for
this
past
discrimination.
and
as
between
various
contractors
for
the
city's
business,
there
is
no
discrimination
at
all.
they
all
get
judged
by
the
same
rules.
mr.
john
payton
it
would
have.
mr.
john
payton
no.
mr.
john
payton
well,
construction
is
competitively
bid,
and
if
the
city
attaches
requirements
to
the
bids,
people
can
choose
not
to
bid.
they
can
bid,
they
can
eat
some
of
their
own
profits,
they
can
shop
around
and
make
the
minority
contractors
take
their
price
down...
this
would
be
a
competitive
market.
and
it
is
a
competitive
market,
also,
for
the
minority
subcontractors.
that
is,
if
croson
identifies
one,
two,
three
subcontractors,
he
can
negotiate
with
them,
and
take
their
price
down.
and
in
the
end,
we
fully
expect
competitive
forces
to
operate
here,
to
create
thriving,
competitive
minority
contractors
who
begin
as
subs
and
will
graduate
to
be--
mr.
john
payton
--i
think
not,
but
that
is
not
the
case
we
have
here.
the
case
we
have
here
is
that
the
prime
negotiates
with
the
sub,
and
he
puts
in
a
bid,
and
the
city...
the
lowest
bid
wins.
and
it's
just
like
the
market
operated
before.
the
primes
have
to
negotiate
with
their
subs
to
get
their
prices.
in
order
to
put
in
a
price
here,
to
be
responsive
you
have
to
find
a
minority
contractor.
and
you
put
in
your
price
in
the
kitty,
and
the
city
takes
the
lowest
bidder
and
pays
the
price.
clearly,
this
way,
the...
any
increase
would
be
borne
by
the
city.
the
design
of
the
program
is
in
fact
to
increase
the
number
of
minority
contractors.
mr.
john
payton
yes.
mr.
john
payton
no,
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
the
prime--
mr.
john
payton
--no,
croson
took
the
position
that
the
requirements
imposed
by
this
program
have
violated
its
rights,
and
rather
than
rebid
this
contract
once
the
minority
subcontractor
had
been
identified,
croson
chose
to
file
this
lawsuit,
which
is
an
appropriate
way
to
proceed.
and--
mr.
john
payton
--there
is
such
an
ordinance,
1981,
i
think,
would
forbid
discrimination
between
primes
and
subs.
i
think
there
are
a
lot
of
other
statutes
out
there
that
affect
in
one
way
or
another
a
lot
of
the
underlying
actions
in
this
case.
the
problem
that
you
face
in
the
construction
industry...
it
is
not
that
easy
to
get
at
this.
and
just
to
say
that
all
those
things
are
now
unlawful...
they
have
been
unlawful.
it
doesn't
affect
the
fact
that
we
have
a
closed
business
system.
it
is
to
affect
the
ramifications
of
this
closed
business
system
that
this
ordinance
is
necessary.
mr.
john
payton
well,
the
question
is,
i
guess
that
question
is
whether
or
not
under
virginia
law,
i
don't
think
that's
a
constitutional
question,
under
virginia
law,
it's
authorized
for
richmond
to
have
an
ordinance
where
it
has
an
exception
to
taking
the
low
bid,
because
it
wants
to
remedy
this
discrimination
in
this
way.
and
that
was
litigated,
and
it's
clear
that
richmond
has
the
authority
to
do
that.
but
i
don't
think
it
raises
a
constitutional
question.
all
the
primes
are
treated
the
same.
mr.
john
payton
i
think--
mr.
john
payton
--yes,
i
think
you
can
consider
this
as
though
it's
a
facial
challenge.
and
i
think
that
it's
clear
that
the
minority
contractor
did
make
a
higher
bid,
but
i
think
you
can't
draw
the
significance
from
it
that
you
started
off
with...
which
is
that
if
there
had
been
negotiations,
it
would
have
remained
a
higher
bid.
that
may
be,
but
we
don't
know
on
this
record.
i
think
this
case
should
be
analyzed
by
looking
at
it
as
a
facial
challenge
to
this
ordinance.
with
regard
to
whether
or
not
croson--
mr.
john
payton
--yes.
but
i
was
going
to
go
to...
the
only
way
the
other
part
of
this
comes
into
it,
the
$7,000
and
the
higher
bid...
is
if
there
is
something
to
whether
or
not
croson
was
improperly
denied
its
waiver.
and
i
think
there
is
a
finding
by
the
district
court,
which
heard
witnesses
on
this,
there's
a
finding
that
the
city
acted
absolutely
reasonably.
that's
the
district
court's
description,
absolutely
reasonably,
in
denying
the
waiver.
mr.
john
payton
yes.
all
that
would
happen
in
that
circumstance
is
that
croson
would
take
the
minority
bid,
which
for
the
purposes
of
this
i
will
concede
is
higher,
put
it
in...
croson
was
the
only
bidder
on
this...
croson
would
have
got
the
contract,
the
city
would
have
paid
the
difference.
that's
exactly
what
would
have
happened,
and
i
think
that
raises
no
constitutional
question
at
all.
mr.
john
payton
that's
correct.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
john
payton
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
john
payton
let
me
just
clarify
that.
under
virginia
law,
it
is
not
possible
for
the
city
of
richmond,
except
in
very,
very
narrow
circumstances,
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
where
a
sub
or
a
prime
comes
from.
and
the
narrow
circumstance
is
if
the
bids
are
exactly
the
same.
also,
i
think
it
is
the
case...
and
there
is
no
evidence
to
the
contrary...
that
the
substantial
portion
of
all
the
construction
work
done
in
richmond
for
richmond
is
by
richmond
contractors
and
subcontractors.
construction
is
by
its
very
nature
a
local--
mr.
john
payton
--yes,
they
could
have.
mr.
john
payton
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
respond
to
four
points.
with
regard
to
the
question
you
raised,
justice
scalia,
about
isn't
there
a
problem
because
croson
wasn't
allowed
to
raise
their
bid
at
the
end,
the
reason...
or
maybe
mr.
ryland
raised
it...
the
reason
croson
wasn't
allowed
to
raise
their
bid
once
it
got
the
bid
from
its
minority
contractor
is,
under
the
city's
procurement
policies,
you
out
in
a
bid,
and
that's
it.
and
when
he
asked
permission
to
raise
his
bid
in
light
of
this,
it
was
denied,
and
he
was
asked
to
re-bid.
and
instead
of
re-bidding,
he
filed
this
lawsuit.
there's
just
no
issue
that
raises
any
constitutional
question
out
of
that.
the
district
court,
in
ruling
on
this
waiver
issue...
if
i
can
just
read
what
the
district
court
said
at
note
20,
supplemental
appendix
231...
"croson
has
not
persuaded
this
court
that
any
of
the
additional
evidence
it
has
adduced,
after
full
discovery,
that
continental.
"
--that's
the
minority
sub...
"was
in
fact
unavailable
or
was
taking
advantage
of
the
plan
to
charge
excessive
prices.
"
"the
city's
decision
was
not
only
reasonable,
but
appears
to
have
been
absolutely
correct.
"
--that
is,
in
having
the
contract
re-bid.
with
regard
to
what
was
actually
before
the
richmond
city
council,
and
what
it
was
trying
to
address,
it
was
not
societal
discrimination.
the
city
council
was
aware
of
what
congress
had
found,
in
the
construction
industry,
and
how
it
had
described
that
industry,
and
what
congress
had
tried
to
do
to
remedy
that.
but
it
was
also
aware
of
what
had
happened
in
its
own
industry,
and
at
the
city
council
hearing,
it
heard
evidence
from
various
of
the
construction
trace
associations,
and
from
that
it
learned
that
there
were
virtually
no
minority
members
of
any
of
the
construction
trade
associations.
it
also
heard
testimony
from
a
former
mayor
that
there
was
a
widespread
discrimination
in
richmond's
own
construction
industry.
and
that
testimony
was
concurred
in
by
the
city
manager.
so,
what
richmond
had
was
a
very
full
set
of
findings
and
understandings.
there
was
no
question
that
this
was
a
remedial
statute.
it
said
so
on
its
face,
and
when
the
issue
of
its
remedial
nature
came
up,
it
came
up
before
all
of
the
trace
association
representatives
testified,
and
none
of
them
took
issue
with
that.
in
the
district
court,
where
there
was
fully
opportunity
to
litigate
this,
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
was
sufficient
factual
predicate
of
discrimination
was
not
joined
by
croson.
there
is
no
rebutting
testimony
about
the
factual
predicate
of
discrimination
in
this
case.
with
regard
to
whether
or
not
there
should
be
a
different
standard
of
proof,
or
scrutiny,
that
attaches
to
a
governmental
body
that
depends
on
its
racial
composition,
i
guess
i
can
only
say
it's
the
same
fourteenth
amendment
and
i
think
it's
the
same
standards,
and
it
applies
whatever
the
racial
composition
of
richmond,
whatever
the
racial
composition
of
richmond's
city
council,
whatever
the
racial
composition
of--
mr.
john
payton
--well,
i
can
remove
the
word
"minority"
if
it
helps
the
analysis.
if
the
state
determined
that
in
fact
its
construction
industry
was
characterized
by
past
racial
discrimination
which
had
locked
out
of
that
business
system
minority
contractors,
i
would
say
it's
irrelevant
what
the
minority
population
of
that
state
is,
as
long
as
it
makes
the
appropriate
findings
in
its
own
locality
and
then
goes
about
trying
to
remedy
that
in
a
way
consistent
with
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court.
mr.
john
payton
i
will
remove
the
word.
as
long
as
it
defines
that
black
contractors
have
been
locked
out,
it
can
seek
that
remedy.
and
the
constitutionality
of
that
remedy
can
be
litigated
in
district
court.
but
certainly
there
is
a
sufficient
basis
in
evidence
for
richmond
to
do
exactly
what
it
did,
and
in
the
district
court
where
this
was
litigated,
nothing
was
presented
to
rebut
any
of
that
factual
finding
of
past
discrimination...
nothing
at
all.
i
think
that
this
is
not
societal
discrimination--
mr.
john
payton
--i
think
it
was
a
closed
business
system,
as
described
by--
mr.
john
payton
--no,
it's
not
the
city.
it's
not
the
city.
it
is
all
aspects
of
the
construction
industry
itself,
from
the
trades...
one
of
the
ways
you
become
a
construction
contractor
is
to
enter
as
a
member
of
a
trade
and
then
leave
that
and
become
a
small
construction
contractor.
that's
blocked
for
black
members.
mr.
john
payton
no,
you
can't.
mr.
john
payton
no,
you
can't.
with
the
construction
industry,
we
know
a
lot
about
what
we
speak
here,
and
there
have
been
studies
and
studies
and
judicial
findings
that
establish
that
there
is
a
closed
business
system
in
the
construction
industry
that
was
being
remedied
by
richmond,
here.
