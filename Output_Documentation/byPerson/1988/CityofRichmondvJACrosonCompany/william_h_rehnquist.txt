chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
87-998,
the
city
of
richmond
v.
the
j.
a.
croson
company.
mr.
payton,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it's
expired?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then,
its
prescribed
duration
was
five
years
from
june?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
expired
on
june
30,
1988?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
that
raise
a
mootness
problem?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
payton.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
ryland.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you're
contending
that
it
couldn't
be
applied
in
this
circumstance?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but...
suppose
the
city,
did
have
authority
to
adopt
an
ordinance
that
might
do
some
of
these
things.
it's
your
contention,
isn't
it,
that
that
ordinance
cannot
constitutionally
be
applied
to
your
situation
here,
where
croson
was
bidding
on
this
contract?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--did
the
city
make
any
finding
that
it
had
previously
discriminated
against
minority
contractors?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
should
we
give
a
different
presumption
as
to
a
remedial
purpose
for
what
congress
did
than
for
what
the
city
of
richmond
did?
wouldn't
they
both
be
doing
it
for
pretty
much
the
same
purpose?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
congress
adopted
might
be
just
a
pork
barrel
thing,
too,
but
we
do
give
it
a
presumption.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ryland.
mr.
payton,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
at
some
point,
don't
you
reach
a
situation...
supposing
a
state
had
60
percent
black
people
in
it.
would
that
state
still
be
able
to
allow
a
set-aside
for
what
they
would
call
i.e.
black
businesses?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
surely
wouldn't
call
them
minority
contracts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
payton.
the
case
is
submitted.
