but
the
ordinance
purport
to
remedy
that
disparity,
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
just
required
subs
to
get
to
a--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
didn't
copy...
it
didn't
follow
the
fullilove
scheme
entirely,
did
it?
on
fullilove,
didn't
the
regulations
require
that
before
any
entity
could
take
advantage
of
the
preference,
that
it
prove
that
it
itself
had
been
discriminated
against?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
an
expressed
provision
of
the
regulation.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
means
that
we...
you're
talking
about
fullilove.
in
fullilove,
the
opinion
of
the
court
itself
indicated
that
the
only
people
who
could
take
advantage
of
the
preference
were
people
who
themselves
could
prove
they
had
been
discriminated
against.
there's
nothing
like
that
it--
justice
byron
r.
white
--there's
nothing
like
that
in
richmond.
people
get
this
preference
whether
or
not
they've
ever
suffered
discrimination.
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it...
this
isn't
exactly
like
fullilove?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
have
to
mix.
was
this
ordinance,
mr.
payton,
reenacted
in
1988?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
was
a
minority
contractor,
a
sub,
who
bid
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
only
reason
he
didn't
get
it,
you
suggest,
is
that
the
prime
really
discriminated
against
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
wouldn't
the
city
really
attain
its
objective
in
this
particular
case
if
it
had
just
had
an
ordinance
that
forbade
discrimination
by
prime
contractors
against
minority
subs?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
there
had
been
100,
say
100
minority
subs
had
bid
this
job,
and
all
of
them
had
been
above
the...
all
had
been
high
bids,
shouldn't
the
low
bid
prevail?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
it's
a
facial
challenge.
that
means
that
the
ordinance
couldn't
be
applied
constitutionally
in
any
conceivable
circumstance.
suppose
there's...
suppose
the
minority
contractor
was
asked
to
lower
his
bid,
and
he
said,
"no,
i'm
not
going
to
lower
my
bid,
that's
a
low
as
i
can
go.
"
now,
could
the
ordinance
be
constitutionally...
could
the
ordinance
constitutionally
require
croson
to
re-bid?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
could
he...
could...
well,
so
the
question
of
re-bidding
would
never
come
up?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
what
happened?
the
city
said
re-bid?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
real...
so
the
question
is,
was
this
ordinance
constitutionally
applied
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
it's
a
facial
challenge?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
city
certainly
would
have
authority
to
remedy
private
discrimination.
it's
a
question
of
what
would
be...
how
would
it
remedy
it?
it
could
certainly
have
an
ordinance
forbidding
private
discrimination.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
give
appropriate
remedies
against
those
who
are
discriminating.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
issue
is
whether
it
itself
could
use
its
own
authority
to
enact
a
set
aside
to
remedy
somebody
else's
discrimination.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
discrimination
was
practiced
by...
who
discriminated
against
the
minority
contractors?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
doesn't
help
me
very
much.
who?
who
did
the
discriminating?
the
city?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
you
could
say
that
about
any
industry.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
past?
way
back
in
the
past?
