justice
white
has
the
sec
formally
suggested
that
wilko
be
overruled?
justice
white
in
mcmanon.
justice
white
they
thought
that
wilko
should
be
overruled?
justice
white
well,
why
should
we
overrule
a
statutory
construction
case?
why
shouldn't
we
leave
it
to
congress?
you
think
just
because
it's
wrong?
because
if
we
go
back
to
overrule
all
the
cases
that
we
now
think
are
wrong,
that
would
be
quite
an
undertaking.
justice
white
well,
we
must
have
thought
that
wilko
was
different.
in
mcmahon
we
must
have
thought
that
12(2)
is
different,
because
we
didn't
overrule
wilko.
justice
white
well,
we
didn't
overrule
wilko,
did
we?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
if
they
were
the
same
issues
we
would
have
overruled
wilko.
justice
white
you
say
there
is
no
difference.
