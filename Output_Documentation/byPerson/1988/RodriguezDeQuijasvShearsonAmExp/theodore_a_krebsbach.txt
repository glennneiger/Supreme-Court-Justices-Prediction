mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioners'
12(2)
claims
can
be
vindicated
in
this
case
at
the
same
self-regulatory
organization
arbitration
forums
under
the
oversight
jurisdiction
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
that
this
court
found
in
mcmahon
were
adequate
to
vindicate
claimant's
rights
under
section
10(b).
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
exactly,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
there
is
no
reason
to
distinguish
section
12
and
section
10(b)
for
purposes
of
arbitrability,
since
the
securities
act
of
1933
and
the
exchange
act
of
1934
constitute
interrelated
components
of
the
federal
regulatory
scheme
governing
transactions
in
securities.
the
securities
exchange
commission
agrees
that
the
mcmahon
holding
applies
equally
to
section
12(2)
claims
under
the
securities
act
as
it
does
to
section
10(b)
claims
under
the
exchange
act
for
sro
forums
under
the
commission's
jurisdiction.
this
conclusion
is
also
reached
by
applying
the
court's
traditional
analysis
which
it
applied
in
mcmanon
for
determining
the
arbitrability
of
a
statutory
claim.
that
is,
that
the
federal
arbitration
act
applies
to
statutory
claims
the
burden
on
the
party
opposing
arbitration
to
show
a
contrary
congressional
intent
expressed
in
the
statute,
its
legislative
history,
or
a
conflict
between
arbitration
and
the
statute.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
in
their
amicus
brief,
your
honor,
in
the
mcmahon
case.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
yes.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
they
did,
and
they
took
the
position
that
their
oversight
jurisdiction
would
cause
12(2)
claims
to
be
arbitrated
as
well
as
10(b)
claims.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
we
disagree,
your
honor,
for
the
same--
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
--that
is
true,
your
honor.
however,
at
the
time,
for
example,
that
the
mcmanon
decision
was
decided
in
1987,
the
lower
courts
had
extended
wilko's
rationale
to
10(b).
notwithstanding
that,
the
courts
have
uniformly
retroactively
applied
the
mcmahon
decisions
to
pending
cases.
we
feel
that
under
chevron--
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
--well,
under
the
chevron
test
which
your
honor
mentioned,
we
feel
that
the
key
test
is
whether
or
not
there
is
any
prejudice
to
the
plaintiffs.
and
in
light
of
the
fact
that
this
court--
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
--it
would
take
place
usually
in
the
venue
closest
to
where
the
plaintiff
resides.
this
venue
would
be
in
texas.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
yes.
not
only
would
we
concede
that,
your
honor;
that
has
been
the
practice
for
as
long
as
i
can
recall.
the
arbitration
itself
will
always
take
place
where
the
claimant
resides.
just
to
follow
upon
my
prior
point
as
far
as
whether
or
not
there
is
any
substantive
prejudice
to
the
plaintiff,
we
believe
that
the
court
has
articulated
time
and
time
again
over
the
past
15
years
that
a
plaintiff
does
not
waive
substantive
rights
in
arbitration.
it's
not
a
situation
where
the
court
would
be
changing
a
prior
decision
with
respect
to
a
substantive
right
under
the
statute.
it
will
simply
be
changing
the
forum
where
the
plaintiff's
rights
will
be
adjudicated,
and
all
the
substantive
rights
that
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
will
have
in
court
they
will
have
in
the
arbitration
forum.
examining
the
statute
itself,
there
is
nothing
in
the
securities
act
of
1933,
any
more
than
there
is
in
the
exchange
act
of
1934,
which
expresses
a
congressional
intent
to
prohibit
arbitration
of
securities
act
claims.
the
only
arguable
evidence
of
such
intent
was
the
anti-waiver
provision,
and
this
court
in
mcmahon
ruled
that
the
anti-waiver
provision
only
bars
arbitration
of
securities
act
claims
when
arbitration
is
inadequate
to
protect
statutory
rights.
also,
with
respect
to
the
legislative
history,
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history,
again
either
in
the
securities
act
or
the
exchange
act,
indicating
a
congressional
intent
in
1933
or
1934
to
prohibit
arbitration
of
federal
securities
act
claims.
petitioners'
argument
is
incorrect
that
congress
expressed
such
an
intent
in
amendments
to
section
28(b)
in
1975
in
a
single
sentence
in
a
conferee
report
which
pertained
to
28(b),
which
was
an
amendment
which
gave
sro
rights,
jurisdictional
rights,
over
member-member
arbitrations
and
did
not
even
address
the
issue
of
investor-member
arbitration.
the
single
sentence
was
as
follows,
that:
"it
was
the
clear
understanding
of
the
conferees
that
this
amendment
did
not
change
existing
law
as
articulated
in
wilko
v.
swan.
"
with
respect
to
the
applicability
and
enforceability
of
arbitration
agreements
between
customers
and
member
firms,
as
opposed
to
member-members.
it's
petitioners'
position
that
this
sentence
indicated
that
congress
in
1975
wished
to
prohibit
arbitration
of
securities
act
claims.
this
same
argument
was
made
to
the
court
in
mcmahon
and
was
considered
and
analyzed
and
rejected
by
the
court
in
mcmahon,
which
held
that
at
best
congress
indicated
in
1975
an
intent
to
leave
the
wilko
issue
to
the
courts.
congress
never
said
in
this
single
sentence
in
1975
what
it
thought
that
the
wilko
law
was.
mcmahon
has
told
us
that
wilko
only
bars
arbitration
of
securities
act
disputes
when
arbitration
is
inadequate.
the
arbitration
forums
before
the
court
today
have
been
expressly
found
to
be
adequate
by
the
court
in
mcmahon.
a
single
ambiguous
sentence
with
respect
to
legislation
pertaining
to
member-member
arbitration
cannot
logically
overcome
the
clear
congressional
intent
expressed
in
the
federal
arbitration
act
and
the
securities
act.
furthermore,
congress
could
have
simply
prohibited
arbitration
of
these
disputes
very
simply
in
1985
by
including
plain
language
in
the
amendment
to
that
effect.
and
it
is
also
instructive
to
look
at
events
since
the
mcmahon
case
was
decided
in
1987.
in
1988
the
congress
passed
very
significant
amendments
in
the
securities
act
area.
however,
although
they
considered
amendments
with
respect
to
securities
arbitration,
they
did
not
enact
any
such
legislation,
although
they
were
aware
at
the
time
that
lower
courts
had
extended
the
court's
holding
in
mcmahon
to
wilko
v.
swan
and
prohibited...
and
allowed
arbitration
of
section
12(2)
claims,
notwithstanding
that,
no
legislation
was
enacted
by
the
congress
in
1988.
finally,
with
respect
to
the
third
prong
of
the
test,
there
is
no
conflict
between
arbitration
and
section
12(2)
and
the
purposes
of
that
statute,
any
more
than
there
is
with
respect
to
section
10(b)
claims.
there
would
of
course
be
a
conflict
if
arbitration
could
not
effectively
carry
out
the
purposes
of
section
12(2).
however,
the
mcmahon
court
has
already
ruled
that
sro
arbitration
forums
with
sec
oversight
jurisdiction
are
adequate.
since
mcmahon,
it
is
significant
to
note
that
there
have
been
significant
changes
in
the
arbitration
rules
which
are
designed
to
improve
the
process
which
was
approved
by
the
court
in
mcmahon
and
further
protect
investors'
rights.
these
rules
have
been
adopted
by
the
security
industry
conference
on
arbitration,
which
is
composed
of
industry
and
public
members,
have
also
been
approved
by
the
sro's
themselves,
and
are
pending
right
now
before
the
sec,
which
is
holding
public
hearings.
we
anticipate
that
within
the
next
month
these
rules
will
be
adopted
as
they
stand
or
with
slight
revisions.
the
first
of
these
rules
has
to
do
with
disclosure
of
the
clause
itself
and
would
require
all
the
arbitration
clauses
to
be
in
plain
english
and
specify
the
procedural
rights
an
investor
is
waiving
by
going
to
arbitration.
secondly,
to
address
some
of
the
concerns
raised
by
the
dissenting
opinion
in
mcmahon
with
respect
to
a
perception
of
possible
bias
at
sro
forums,
a
number
of
rule
changes
have
been
proposed.
these
rules...
these
rule
changes
are
in
the
context
of
a
point
made
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
mcmahon
that,
since
the
sro's
in
effect
run
these
forums,
there
may
be
a
perception,
although
unfounded
by,
unsupported
by
empirical
data,
that
perhaps
the
sro's
favor
members
and
there
is
a
bias
against
investors
at
these
forums.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
the
arbitration
clause
at
issue
in
this
case?
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
the
arbitration
clause
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
identical
arbitration
clause
that
the
court
examined
in
mcmahon.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
no,
it
does
not.
and
in
fact,
the
sec
has
not
in
any
way
attempted
to
indicate
that
any
arbitration
forms
used
in
the
past
were
not
adequate
contracts.
it's
simply
in
effect,
we
believe,
bending
over
backwards
to
address
these
perception
concerns.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
they
will
apply
just
to
future
contracts.
fundamentally,
the
issue
here
is
not
where
the
arbitration
is
held,
but
whether
the
arbitrators
themselves
who
decide
these
cases
are
fair
and
whether
they're
chosen
in
a
fair
and
impartial
manner.
and
what
a
number
of
people
have
looked
at,
including
the
dissenters
in
mcmahon,
is
whether
or
not
people
described
as
public
arbitrators
at
sro
forums
in
fact
have
perhaps
contacts
with
the
industry
and
should
be
labeled
as
securities
arbitrators.
so
what
these
rules
have
done
is
addressed
situations
perhaps
where
a
spouse
of
an
industry
person
may
have
been
an
arbitrator,
and
they
have
ruled
those
people
cannot
serve
as
a
public
arbitrator,
they
have
to
be
labeled
a
securities
arbitrator.
people
that
are
retired,
but
had
recent
affiliations
will
the
industry,
are
no
longer
labeled
under
the
new
rule
as
a
public
arbitrator.
nor
do
people
that
have
industry
ties,
such
as
attorneys
representing
brokerage
firms
and
other
similar
situations,
are
no
longer
able
to
be
listed
as
public
arbitrators.
in
addition,
arbitrators
must
publish
previous
ten-year
biographies,
so
that
people
are
adequately
aware
of
the
background
of
these
arbitrators.
and
this,
combined
with
the
fact
that
the
majority
of
the
arbitrators
at
sro
forums
are
always
from
the
public
and
that
the
investor
has
a
preremptory
challenge
and
unlimited
challenges
for
cause,
we
believe,
together
with
the
sec
oversight
over
these
rules,
ensures
that
the
process
will
be
fair
and
will
be
perceived
as
fair.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
exactly,
your
honor.
the
sro
forums
are
simply
the
exchange
forums,
whether
it's
the
new
york
stock
exchange,
the
nasd,
and
i
believe
there
are
about
twelve
other
exchanges
that
have
arbitration
forums.
shearson,
as
a
member
of
probably
all
of
these
exchanges,
is
required
to
arbitrate
at
any
of
those
at
the
selection
and
choice
of
the
investor
in
the
first
instance.
another
perception
problem
with
respect
to
the
arbitration
process
itself
has
to
do
with
what
is
perceived
as
a
limited
record
for
appeal,
and
it
was
noted
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
mcmahon
that
there
is
no
requirement
of
a
transcript
at
the
sro
forums.
that
has
now
been
changed.
a
transcript
is
going
to
be
required
under
these
new
rules.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
we
agree,
your
honor.
we
think
that
it
goes
beyond
that.
there
has
been
a
line
of
cases
by
this
court
during
the
past
15
years...
mitsubishi,
scherk,
moses
cone,
southland
v.
keating,
byrd,
up
to
and
including
mcmahon,
which
have
addressed
this
issue
of
arbitration
in
a
consistent
and
uniform
manner
and
have
articulated
an
approach
to
the
arbitration
of
statutory
disputes
which
we
feel
is
inconsistent
with
that--
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
--it's
unclear,
your
honor,
because
the
12(2)
issue--
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
--well,
the
12(2)
issue
was
not
before
the
court
in
wilko,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
well,
it
appears--
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
--based
on
the
rationale
that
the
court
used
in
mcmahon,
we
feel
there
is
no
difference,
because
if
you
look
at
the
adequacy
of
the
forum
to
resolve
the
dispute
we
feel
that
an
sro
forum
with
sec
oversight
jurisdiction
is
just
as
adequate
to
resolve
a
dispute
under
the
securities
act
as
the
exchange
act.
and
it's
true,
your
honor,
you
did
not
overrule
wilko
in
mcmahon.
we
believe
it
was
because
it
was
not
before
the
court.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
no,
i
think
the
effect
of
not
overruling
wilko,
to
the
extent
that
mcmahon
also
stays
intact,
would
be
that
agreements
under
the
securities
act
would
not
be
arbitrated
and
agreements
under
the
exchange
act
would.
i
don't
know
it
this
would
be
a
good
policy
or
would
be
consistent
with
congressional
intent.
i
think
it
would
also
cause
a
lot
of
confusion
with
respect
to
the
arbitration
of
other
statutory
disputes.
wilko
really
stands
alone
with
respect
to
this
court's
arbitration
jurisprudence,
in
that
it's
really
the
only
case
where
it
in
the
first
instance
presumed
that
the
arbitration
forum
was
inadequate.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
until
this
court's
decision
in
mcmahon.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
well,
what
the
court
said
in
mcmahon
was
that
wilko
meant
that
an
anti-waiver
provision
will
bar
arbitration
of
disputes
under
the
federal
securities
laws
if
arbitration
is
inadequate.
and
i
believe
that
the
court
in
mcmahon
also
said
that
congress
has
left
this
issue
to
the
courts
because
they
believe
in
the
first
instance
it
would
make
no
sense
for
congress
to
have
to
conduct
an
inquiry
on
each
occasion
whether
a
particular
arbitration
forum
was
inadequate.
i
think
it
makes
good
sense
that
this
issue
was
left
to
the
courts,
and
i
think
congress
has
done
so.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
why
they
have
not
acted?
i
believe
subsequent
to
mcmahon
it
made
very
good
sense
for
the
congress
to
leave
this
issue
to
the
courts,
and
i
believe
that
they
think
that
the
sro
arbitration
system
is
adequate.
it's
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
which
is
the
congressional
agency
which
is
empowered
to
protect
investors'
rights
under
the
securities
act.
i
think
congress
feels
confident
that
the
sec
can
do
the
job
in
this
area.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
well,
if
you
look
at
the
whole
notion
of
congressional
action
by
silence,
clearly
the
cases
go
both
ways.
i
think
there
have
been
a
lot
of
cases
where
the
court
has
re-examined
precedent
and
overturned
it
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
congress
has
done
nothing
in
the
intervening
years.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
that
would
be
the
result.
it's
not
necessarily
the
reason,
but
that
would
be
one
of
the
results.
and
to
answer
your
question,
yes,
i
think
the
sro
process
is
an
arbitration
process--
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
--that
it
would
take
away
a
burden
from
the
courts?
i
think--
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
--there
has
been
a
lot
of
bad
publicity
during
the
past
five
years,
there's
no
doubt
about
it.
however,
i
should
point
out
again
that
arbitration
proceedings,
although
they
are
officially
public,
that
has
not
prevented
investors
in
the
past
from
going
to
the
press
with
the
results
of
their
arbitration
if
it
was
to
their
benefit.
but
more
significantly,
i
think
that
the
court
must
rely
on
the
fact
that
there
is
sec
oversight
in
this
area
and
trust
the
sec
to
do
the
job,
and
i
believe
they
have.
going
back
to
the
issue
of
the
transcripts,
we
believe
that
the
fact
that
there
now
will
be
a
transcript
of
these
cases
and
under
the
new
rules
the
arbitrators
must
list
the
issues
decided
and
the
damages
awarded,
and
that
together
with
the
documents
would
give
an
appellate
court
if
necessary
a
complete
evidentiary
record
to
review
on
a
motion
to
vacate.
the
fourth
and
last
issue
which
is
addressed
by
these
new
rules
is
the
issue
of
the
adequacy
of
discovery
in
arbitration.
now,
as
everyone
knows,
one
of
the
positive
points
about
arbitration
is
that
you
don't
have
the
unlimited,
unfettered
discovery
of
the
type
that
you
have
in
federal
court,
which
oftentimes
is
abused
and
which
oftentimes
results
in
a
lot
of
the
delay
and
cost
of
litigation.
now,
the
uniform
code
provides
certain
discovery
guidelines
which
have
been
approved
by
the
sec.
practically
speaking,
an
investor
can
receive
any
documents
from
any
member
firm
across
the
country,
whether
the
firm
is
a
party
or
not.
and
the
arbitrators
have
the
power
to
refer
for
disciplinary
proceedings
any
member
who
does
not
comply
with
their
directives.
as
a
practical
result,
if
the
investor
makes
an
informal
demand
for
documents,
if
they
are
not
produced
they
go
to
the
arbitrators,
and
if
the
documents
are
relevant
they
will
direct
the
parties,
the
member
firms,
to
produce
them.
in
addition,
the
rules
now
provide
for
a
prehearing
conference
where
any
prehearing
discovery
disputes
can
be
resolved.
and
in
addition,
the
attorneys
have
the
same
subpoena
power
that
they
would
have
under
law.
finally,
with
respect
to
depositions,
the
arbitrators
will
now
have
the
power
to
direct
depositions
in
cases
where
they
feel
they
are
appropriate.
as
mcmahon
correctly
held,
there
is
no
conflict
between
the
arbitration
act
and
the
purposes
of
the
securities
laws.
we
as
respondents
would
argue
that
the
combination
of
the
arbitrator
expertise
at
sro
forums
combined
with
the
control
by
the
arbitrators
of
the
oftentimes
abused
discovery
process
will
in
many
cases
make
arbitration
a
preferred
means
of
dispute
resolution
for
investors.
while
the
court
does
not
have
to
expressly
overrule
wilko
to
find
in
favor
of
respondents
in
this
case...
it
can
hold
simply
that
it
will
follow
the
mcmahon
rationale
with
respect
to
sro
arbitrations
which
are
adequate...
respondents
believe
that
the
stare
decisis
doctrine
is
best
served
by
the
court
ruling
that
mcmahon
is
no
longer
good
law.
if
wilko
is
overruled,
there
will
be
a
consistent
interpretation
and
application
by
this
court
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
in
numerous
decisions
over
the
past
15
years.
this
will
allow
individuals
to
predict
outcomes
in
similar
cases.
in
addition,
the
stare
decisis
objective
of
preventing
constant
relitigation
of
similar
issues
with
respect
to
other
statutory
claims
will
also
be
served.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
yes,
conceivably
a
document
could
list
virtually
any
arbitration
forum
whatsoever.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
they
would,
you're
absolutely
right.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
i
think
what
the
court
should
do
to
address
that
situation
is
in
the
first
instance
assume
that
the
forum
will
be
adequate.
i
think
there
are
sufficient
statutory
safeguards
in
place
to
address
the
adequacy--
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
--i
wouldn't
use
the
terms
"good"
and
"bad",
but
arbitration
that's
adequate
to
protect
statutory
rights
should
be
allowed
and
arbitration
that
isn't
should
not
be
allowed.
mr.
theodore
a.
krebsbach
i
do
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
i
think
that
there
should
be
a
presumption
that
arbitration
is
adequate
and
that
there
are
adequate
statutory
safeguards,
in
those
cases
where
during
the
course
of
the
hearing
itself
it
is
demonstrated
not
to
be
the
case,
to
then
make
a
motion
to
vacate
and
have
the
award
overturned.
i
don't
think
it
makes
sense
for
the
court
to
have
to
examine
in
the
first
instance
the
adequacy
of
the
forum
prior
to
having
an
arbitration
hearing.
i
think
that
goes
against
the
congressional
intent
behind
the
arbitration
act
in
enforcing
the
parties'
contracts
to
have
a
swift
resolution
of
their
dispute.
if
wilko
is
overruled,
the
court
will
create
uniformity
in
its
interpretation
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
and
also
reject
an
outdated
precedent
in
light
of
its
cases
over
the
past
15
years.
in
conclusion,
respondents
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
unanimous
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
enforcing
the
parties'
agreement
to
arbitrate
their
section
12(2)
dispute.
this
will
also
avoid
the
result
in
this
case
where
the
petitioners'
12(2)
claims
will
proceed
in
federal
court
while
their
other
claims
under
rico,
section
10(b)
of
the
exchange
act,
and
common
law
claims
will
proceed
in
arbitration.
such
a
result
we
feel
makes
for
bad
policy
and
thwarts
the
congressional
intent
in
the
federal
arbitration
act,
as
would
any
ruling
that
distinguishes
between
different
sections
of
the
securities
act
and/or
the
exchange
act
for
purposes
of
arbitrability.
unless
the
court
has
questions,
i
have
nothing
further.
