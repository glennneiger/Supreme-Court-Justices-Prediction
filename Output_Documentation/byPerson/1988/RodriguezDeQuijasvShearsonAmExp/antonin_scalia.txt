perhaps
there
is,
but
is
it
an
explanation
that
has
anything
to
do
with
the
difference
between
the
two
sections
for
present
purposes?
justice
scalia
well,
you
say
that
the
jurisdictional
provisions
are
different.
well,
that
may
be
true.
they
may
use
different
words
as
well.
but
why
does
that
have
anything
to
do
whether...
with
the
question
whether
for
purposes
of
the
question
before
us
today
you
should
treat
10(b)
and
12(2)
any
differently?
justice
scalia
well,
no,
you
have
to
say
less
inclined
to
protect
sellers
and
purchasers
than
to
protect
purchasers
alone.
is
that
your
point?
justice
scalia
mr.
downey,
could
i
come
back
to
the
adhesion
contract
point
for
a
moment.
what
did
the
lower
courts
say
about
that?
justice
scalia
well,
they
had
to
address
it,
didn't
they?
i
mean,
even
it
you
lose
on
the
arbitrability
point,
surely
it
would
be
trumped
by
the
fact
that
it's
not
a
valid
contract
anyway,
wouldn't
it?
how
could
they
not
have
addressed
it?
justice
scalia
well,
but
that's
applying
a
doctrine
of
adhesion.
what
they're
saying
is
it
is
not
an
adhesion
contract
unless
there's--
justice
scalia
--how
can
they
possibly
do
that?
i
mean,
you
can
say
there's
no
contract.
they've
really
been
doing
that?
you
say
there's
no
contract
and
the
court
below
says,
well,
maybe
there
was
and
maybe
there
wasn't,
but
we're
only
going
to
look
at
the
meaning
of
this
particular
contractual
term?
and
you
jumped
up
and
said,
but
there's
no
contract
at
all,
and
the
court
says,
well,
maybe
there
was
and
maybe
there
wasn't?
justice
scalia
i
can't
believe
they
did
that.
justice
scalia
oh,
i
see.
you're
saying
that
they
defer
that
question
and
leave
the
question
of
adhesion
to
the
arbitrator.
justice
scalia
well,
what's
the
matter
with
that?
justice
scalia
or
not
vindicated,
as
the
case
may
be.
your
point
is
that
it's
no
better
and
no
worse.
justice
scalia
what
if
we
didn't
treat
the
two
the
same?
would
one
govern,
govern
the
practice?
in
other
words,
would
the
effect
of
not
overruling
wilko
be
to
simply
deprive
mcmahon
of
all
practical
effect?
justice
scalia
well,
that
depends
on
what
other
kinds
of
arbitration
there
can
be.
are
there
any
other
kinds
of
arbitration
that
could
possibly
be
written
into
an
agreement
that
would
come
under
the
acts?
justice
scalia
so
what
do
we
do
with
those?
with
respect
to
those,
all
these
nice
arguments
you've
been
making
to
us
about
how
good
the
sro
arbitration
is
would
be
irrelevant,
wouldn't
they?
justice
scalia
so
how
predictable
would
that
case
be?
justice
scalia
you
want
us
to
interpret
the
statute
so
that
only
good
arbitration
is
exempted
from
it,
bad
arbitration
is
not
exempted
from
it?
justice
scalia
well,
i
think
any
arbitration
that
would
pass
muster
in
judicial
review
as
being
rudimentarily
fair
and
not
being
set
aside
by
judicial
review
is
good
enough
arbitration,
i
would
presume.
i
mean,
i
can't
see
reading
the
statute...
you
read
the
statute
to
say
arbitration
is
part
of
the
rights
that
you
can't
waive
or
it
isn't.
we
can't
possibly
pick
and
choose
among
various
types
of
arbitration,
can
we?
