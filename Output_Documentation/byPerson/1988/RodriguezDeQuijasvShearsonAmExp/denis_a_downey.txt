mr.
denis
a.
downey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
these
cases
arise
from
complaints
filed
in
the
southern
district
of
texas,
brownsville
division,
which
allege
violations
of
state
common
law,
including
sexual
assault,
state
statutory
securities
provisions,
and
federal
securities
provisions.
pursuant
to
the
order
of
the
district
court,
all
these
issues
were
ordered
submitted
to
arbitration,
with
the
exception
of
the
12(2)
securities
act
claims.
that
order
was
appealed
to
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
who
in
effect
held
that
this
court's
decision
in
mcmahon
had
overruled
the
wilko
decision,
and
the
fifth
circuit
ordered
the
12(2)
claims
be
in
fact
arbitrated.
and
it's
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
fifth
circuit
in
fact
that
we
are
here
before
you
today.
these
facts
basically
are
similar.
they
involve
a
number
of
plaintiffs.
the
basic
allegation
is
fraudulent
trades
in
the
accounts
of
these
individuals.
while
a
brief
review
of
the
facts
indicates
that
they
are
sad
facts,
the
remarkable
thing
about
these
cases
are
in
fact
that
these
cases
are
all
too
common.
the
reality
of
america
is
that
women
outlive
men,
and
the
result
is
that
at
some
point
in
a
woman's
life
she
finds
herself
with
insurance
proceeds
or
with
liquidation
of
business
proceeds,
frequently
lacking
in
business
experience,
and
with
a
fear
for
future
financial
security.
these
cases
are
about
in
fact
all
of
us.
as
we
see
this
case,
the
critical
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
this
court
is
going
to
overrule
its
decision
rendered
in
wilko
36
years
ago.
the
standard
analysis
that's
been
applied
to
all
this
court's
cases
would
appear
to
be
that
we
look
at
the
purposes,
the
legislative
history,
and
the
text
of
the
acts
in
question.
and
of
course,
we're
dealing
here
with
the
federal
arbitration
act
of
1925
and
the
federal
securities
act
of
1933.
in
the
petitioners'
view,
the
federal
arbitration
act
has
been
read
much
too
broadly.
it
would
appear
that
the
text
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
expresses
the
intent
to
place
arbitration
contracts
on
exactly
the
same
footing
as
other
contracts.
and
that
is
also
what
the
legislative
history
would
seem
to
indicate.
the
key
phrase
here
throughout
the
court
cases
that
have
reviewed
the
legislative
history
of
that
act
is
that
the
intent
was
to
place
these
contracts
on
the
same
footing
as
other
contracts.
we
do
not
see
an
elevated
federal
policy
in
the
federal
arbitration
act.
mr.
denis
a.
downey
yes,
that's
unquestionably,
unquestionably
true.
our
purpose
here
is,
rather
than
in
the
absolute
sense,
to
try
to
create
a
better
comparative
balance
between
the
federal
arbitration
act
and
the
1933
securities
act.
we
see
the
federal
arbitration
act
as
involving
federal
policies
of
considerably
less
importance
than
that
of
the
1933
securities
act.
mr.
denis
a.
downey
well,
i
would
say
that,
first
of
all,
the
fact
that
the
10(b)
action,
the
civil
part
of
it,
is
an
implied
cause
of
action.
although
i
understand
there's
a
sensitivity
that
we
shouldn't
treat
implied
actions
differently
than
express
actions,
i
think
there
are
some
contexts
where
that
fact
would
be
true.
in
this
instance,
this
may
well
have
been
an
instance
where
congress
intended
that
the
area
be
left
to
the
courts
for
general
development.
i
would
also
point
out
that
there
is
a
difference
in
10(b)
and
12(2)
in
the
sense
that
12(2)
addresses...
purports
to
protect
purchasers
of
securities,
whereas
the
10(b)
action
is
both
purchasers
and
sellers.
so
perhaps
congress
felt
less
inclined
to
protect
in
fact
brokers
under
section
10,
who
would
be
sellers.
i
think
the
legislative
history
of
the
'33
securities
act
shows...
and
also
i
would
add
to
that
that
obviously
the
difference
of
the
jurisdictional
provisions
tells
us
something.
there
must
be
a
reason
why
the
jurisdictional
provisions
are
not
the
same.
there
must
be
some
sort
of
a
logical
explanation
for
that.
the
'33
securities
act--
mr.
denis
a.
downey
--i'm
not
sure
i
understand
that
question.
mr.
denis
a.
downey
well,
i
would
say
because
perhaps
congress
was
less
inclined
to
protect
the
sellers
of
securities
under
the
'34
act,
as
opposed
to
the
'33
act,
which
protects
the
purchaser;
that
perhaps
congress
was
less
sympathetic.
mr.
denis
a.
downey
yes,
but
in
kind
of
a
subtractive
sense.
and
i
understand
your
question.
it's
well
taken,
obviously.
what
we
see
in
the
1933
securities
act
is
that
congress...
one
of
the
problems
with
the
securities
field
after
the
crash
and
before
was
that
the
state
legislation
that
existed
was
a
patchwork,
and
one
of
the
substantive
reasons
that
the
'33
securities
act
was
passed
in
fact
was
to
create
a
situation
where
the
issuers
of
securities
could
not
run
and
hide
in
a
convenient
state.
and
so
that
concept
would
seem
to
connect
with
section
22,
which
appears
to
give
the
purchaser
of
securities
the
right
in
fact
to
place
issuers
in
the
court
of
their
choice
and
in
the
venue
selection
of
their
choice.
we
think
it's
also
significant
that
the
'33
securities
act
adopted
the
brandels
thesis
of
fiduciary
duty,
which
we
think
is
highly
relevant
to
these
cases.
the
legislative
history
of
the
'33
act
shows
a
discussion
of
the
fine
print
in
prospectuses,
indicates
that
there
was
a
need
to
protect
the
old
and
the
unsophisticated,
which
is
certainly
before
this
court
today;
and
also
indicated
there
had
been
an
historical
ineffectiveness
of
enforcement
of
criminal
sanctions
of
wire
and
mail
fraud
statutes.
in
fact,
the
'33
legislative
history
would
seem
to
show
that
congress
realized
that
it
was
important
that
private
enforcement
would
be
used
to
effectuate
the
goals.
mr.
denis
a.
downey
we
have
made
the
argument
consistently
through
the
district
court
that
in
fact
these
are
adhesion
contracts
and
that
there
is
overreaching.
mr.
denis
a.
downey
it's
never
been
addressed,
no.
mr.
denis
a.
downey
yes,
that's
correct,
justice.
mr.
denis
a.
downey
well,
i
think
that
goes...
i
think
the
key
issue
on
the
retroactivity
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
would
be
manifest
or
substantial
injustice
to
apply
this
case
retroactively,
and
we
think
that
that's
a
question
that--
mr.
denis
a.
downey
--these
agreements
were
signed
in
1982
and
1983,
and
owing
to
the
criminal
docket
of
the
southern
district
little
progress
has
been
made.
mr.
denis
a.
downey
the
lower
courts
really
didn't
address
the
question.
mr.
denis
a.
downey
okay.
they
could
not
have
addressed
it...
and
that's
a
major
problem
in
this
whole
arbitration
area.
they
did
not
address
it
because
of
the
existing
principle
that
one
may
not
address
these
issues
unless
there
is
an
allegation
of
fraud
in
the
inducement
of
the
specific
arbitration
term.
so
district
courts
aren't
looking
at
these,
at
these
terms,
at
the
basic
contract
itself,
unless
you
can
come
forward
and
show--
mr.
denis
a.
downey
--well,
what
they're
saying
is
we
will
address
only
one
question,
whether
or
not
there
is
fraud
in
the
inducement
of
this
specifically
in
the
arbitration
provision;
we
will
ignore
any
other
contractual
issue.
and
so
that
if
the
broker
holds
a
gun--
mr.
denis
a.
downey
--that's
right.
mr.
denis
a.
downey
right,
and
the
argument
i
made
to
the
fifth
circuit
in
fact
was
that
if
the
broker
held
a
gun
up
to
the
client's
head
and
said,
sign
the
contract,
under
the
way
that
they've
interpreted
that
we
can't
do
anything
about
that,
that
has
to
go
to
arbitration,
because
he
didn't
hold
a
gun
up
and
say,
sign
the
arbitration
term.
so
it's
created
a
situation
where
district
courts
really
don't
get
to
review
these
things
until
after
arbitration.
mr.
denis
a.
downey
correct.
mr.
denis
a.
downey
well,
in
the
egregious
case
where
there
is
obvious
overreaching,
that
means
we
go
through
the
arbitration
process,
entertain
that
question,
and
go
back,
you
know,
to
district
court
again.
it
takes
a
lot
of
time,
and
that's
obviously
an
inefficient
way
to
utilize
judicial
resources.
i
think
if
there's
a
fundamental
claim
like
that,
the
district
court
ought
to
decide
it
up
front.
mr.
denis
a.
downey
right.
the
overreaching...
well,
there's
overreaching
in
the
sense
and
adhesiveness
in
the
sense
that
virtually
all
of
these
margin
contracts
require
that
term.
mr.
denis
a.
downey
well,
in
essence
they...
it's
an
interesting
question.
presumably
that's
what
they
found,
although
i
don't
believe
there's
a
specific
finding
to
that
effect.
in
all
of
these
cases,
these
investors
had
absolutely
no
idea
what
they
were
signing.
this
document
was
face
down,
it
was
fine
print.
these
people
were
not
sophisticated.
these
people
were,
you
know,
neophyte
investors
who
had
no
concept
at
all
what
it
was
they
were
being
asked
to
sign.
they
didn't
even
receive
copies
of
these
documents
so
they
could
later
review
them
and
change
their
mind
and
take
their
money
out
of
the
market.
that
never
happened.
the
issue
for
us,
of
course,
is
what
wilko
decided,
and
we
think
it's
very
clear,
based
on
36
years
of
what
legal
commentators
said
and
based
on
every
decision
of
this
court
with
the
exception
of
mcmahon,
that
wilko
said
that
the
waiver
of
the
choices
in
section
22
amounted
to
an
attempted
waiver
of
the
provision.
and
we
think
that
that's
very
clearly
what
wilko
decided,
even
though
the
wilko
court
gratuitously
went
on
to
note
that,
perhaps
12(2)
claims
a
special
right,
the
reverse
burden
of
proof
could
not
be
properly
vindicated
in
anything
but
a
judicial
forum,
and
also
buttressed
that
argument
by
adopting
the
securities
exchange
commission
argument
that
in
fact
that
burden
in
12(2)
was
effectively
reversed
again
against
the
purchaser
of
the
security
through
the
lack
of
appeal.
in
fact,
because
section
10
of
the
arbitration
act
is
so
restrictive,
it
becomes
virtually
impossible
for
someone
who
loses
an
arbitration
to
effectively
appeal
that
decision.
we
think
that
wilko
was
very
clearly
decided
on
the
choices
lost
under
22(a).
and
what
we
are
saying
basically
what
wilko
held
is
exactly
what
shearson/american
express
told
you
here
two
years
ago,
and
really
we're
not
saying
anything
more
than
that.
they
did
add
to
our
argument
the
fact
that
1c(b)
was
an
implied
cause
of
action.
mr.
denis
a.
downey
well,
of
course
our
expectation
is
that
at
some
point
these
will
be
held
to
be
adhesion
contracts.
presumably
if
this
court
returns
this
case
to
the
district
court
for
trial
on
that
issue,
on
the
12(2)
issue,
that
will
happen
there.
mr.
denis
a.
downey
well,
the
claim,
that
claim,
is
made
in
the
complaint
but
that
was
not
a
matter
that
was
appealed
to
the
fifth
circuit.
the
fifth
circuit
strictly
was
on
the
question
of
12(2).
our
position
is
that
wilko
should
not
be
overruled.
over
and
above
the
broad
jurisprudential
issues
in
question,
we
think,
first
of
all,
this
is
not
a
constitutional
case.
the
court
has
not
put
congress
in
the
situation
where
it
can't
do
anything.
this
is
not
one
of
those
cases
where
congress
has
left
the
development
of
law
to
the
court.
this
is
a
very
specific,
narrow,
carefully
drawn
statute.
congress
has
acquiesced
in
this
decision
for
36
years.
as
this
court
noted
in
huddleston,
also
the
fact
that
when
it
made
its
amendments
in
'75
to
the
securities
laws,
plural,
there
was
no
change
made
in
the
coexistence
of
section
11
causes
of
action
and
10(b)
causes
of
action,
and
we
think
that
argument
applies
here.
in
1975
congress,
when
it
changed
the
arbitration
provisions,
did
not
in
fact
make
any
changes
to
the
securities
act.
in
fact,
in
'75
in
the
conference
report
they
specifically
endorsed
wilko.
and
however
pejorative
a
view
one
takes
as
to
what
that
might
be,
what
that
might
have
meant
with
respect
to
10(b)(5),
we
think
it's
very
clear
and
express
that
we
adopted...
that
congress
adopted
wilko.
and
that's
exactly
what
shearson
said
to
this
court
two
years
ago
in
mcmahon.
we
would
also
point
out
that
recent
attempts
to
make
modifications
in
this
area
by
congress...
h.r.
4960
attempted
to
address
only
the
jurisdictional
provision
of
the
1934
act.
no
attempt
was
made
to
change
the
'33
act.
we
think
that
the
quality
of
arbitration
is
at
issue
because
of
the
arguments
on
retroactive
application
of
any
change
that
this
court
might
make
to
wilko,
because
i
think
that
respondent
will
pretty
much
agree
that
the
key
issue
here
on
retroactivity
would
be
whether
or
not
there
was
a
manifest
injustice
which
would
be
occasioned
by
retroactive
application.
and
that
would
seem
to
turn
on
whether
or
not
the
arbitration
forms
can
fairly
vindicate
12(2)
claims.
we
don't
think
they
can.
what
we
have
said
basically
more
than
anything
is
that
there's
a
lot
of
things
wrong
inherently
with
arbitration.
there's
nothing
that
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
can
do
to
give
us
an
article
iii
judge
choice,
nor
to
give
us
a
jury.
we...
our
basic
position
is
also
that
this
is
the
worst
possible
choice
we're
being
given.
we're
being
given
a
choice
between
home
court
a
and
home
court
b.
there
is
an
inherent
self-interest
in
those
forums.
it's
shearson/american
express
that
gets
to
pick
them.
so
obviously,
if
those
forums
don't
give
the
results
that
shearson/american
express
wants,
they're
not
going
to
appear
in
their
form
document.
we
also
think
that
people
who
are
designated
as
arbitrators
in
this
case
are
going
to
be
hired
by
the
exchanges
and
obviously
are
self-interested.
the
challenge
that
we
threw
out
to
the
industries,
the
securities
industry
and
the
arbitration
industry,
in
our
mcmahon
amicus
brief
was
to
show
us
that,
notwithstanding
obvious
inequalities
in
the
procedures
of
arbitration,
that
in
fact
the
results
were
fair.
that
challenge
has
not
been
answered.
what
we
have
in
response
to
that
challenge
in
fact
is
a
three-month
study
that
the
industry...
an
accountant,
an
accounting
firm,
did
for
the
industry,
which
allowed
selected
members
of
that
industry
to
pick
their
favorite
three
months
to
provide
a
result.
and
we
think
that
that's
not
the...
that's
not
the
level
of
proof,
for
example,
that
was
utilized
in
overturning
plessy
v.
ferguson.
that
to
us
is
not
a
serious
jurisprudential
insight.
as
far
as
the...
a
comment
needs
to
be
made
on
the
securities
and
exchange
oversight.
this
court
obviously
considered
that
to
be
of
some
significance
in
the
mcmahon
case.
we
have
a
problem
with
that
because
we
wouldn't
be
here
in
the
first
place
if
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
had
enforced
their
15c2-2
rule
in
the
first
place.
we
find
that
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
has
been
very
variable
in
its
protection
of
investors.
one
will
recall
that
they
appeared
against
arbitrability
in
wilko,
they
appeared
for
it
in
mcmahon,
and
that
they
have
not
appeared
to
take
any
position
in
this
case
whatsoever.
we
also
have
a
serious
question
about
whether
or
not
really
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
has
authority
to
change
these
arbitration
rules.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
argument
that's
being
made
by
respondents
is
that
the
'33
act
is
not
specific
enough
to
override
this
wide,
this
virtually
unfettered
power
that
parties
have
under
the
arbitration
act
to
make
contracts
for
arbitration.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
changes
made
in
1975
lack
that
same
specificity
in
giving
to
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
the
power
to
generally
control
sro's.
we
also
feel
that
the
court
should
give
some
consideration
to
protecting
the
unsophisticated
investor.
how
that
could
be
done
is
a
difficult
question,
but
it
may
be
that
perhaps
12(2)
claims
are
less
suitable
to
arbitration
where
the
investors,
as
here,
are
really
unsophisticated.
we
would
also
like
to
make
the
observation
that
in
a
sense
this
case
comments
upon
the
relative
merits
of
adjudication
and
arbitration,
and
it
seems
to
petitioners
it's
somewhat
ironic
that,
after
what
can
only
be
described
as
the
great
history
of
this
court
that
has
given
us
one
man,
one
vote,
and
ended
segregation,
the
principle
of
judicial
review,
that
there
are
no
true
amicus
who
come
before
this
court
to
in
fact
defend
the
role
of
this
court,
and
really
that
that
defense
fails
to
a
somewhat
sad
group
of
investors
from
brownsville,
texas,
whose
greatest
expectation
in
all
of
this
is
to
simply
recover
their
life
savings.
thank
you.
mr.
denis
a.
downey
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
some
comments
have
been
made
about
the
changes
that
have
been
proposed
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
first
of
all,
we're
two
years
post-mcmanon
and
we
haven't
had
those.
but
there
are
two
things
that
those
changes
do
not
address
that
are
critical.
the
one
is
they're
not
going
to
require
arbiters,
arbitrators,
to
give
legal
reasons
for
their
decisions,
and
that's
going
to
make
it
very
difficult
to
effectively
appeal
those
decisions.
the
second
and
most
critical
thing
it
doesn't
address
is
the
selection
of
the
panels
for
arbitration.
the
truth
is
that
we
think
the
industry
cheats.
the
industry
says
they
have
500
people
that
can
hear
these
cases,
but
in
fact
they
have
pre-selected
a
group
who,
based
on
the
history
of
prior
arbitrations,
are
going
to
give
the
result
that
they
want.
so
when
we
go
to
arbitration
we
have
a
choice
in
fact
between
15
people
who
are
going...
who
have
a
bias
against
us,
a
proven
bias.
and
it's
not
a
question
of
public
or
non-public
arbitrator;
it's
a
question
of
what
their
track
record
is,
that
only
the
nasd
knows
or
only
the
nyse
knows.
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
the
venue
in
these
cases
on
arbitration
is
dallas,
which
is
a
distance
of
some
500
miles
from
where
these
people
live.
the
other
thing
that
i
think
is
significant
is
that,
in
relation
to
what
congress
said
in
1975,
this
respondent
said
to
this
court
at
page
17
of
the
mcmanon
brief:
"the
plain
meaning
of
this
language
expresses
congressional
intent
that
the
1975
amendments
not
change
the
wilko
holding
that
claims
arising
under
section
12(2)
of
the
securities
act
are
non-arbitrable.
"
it
seems
that
the
securities
industry
is
here
selling
this
court
arbitration
once
again.
in
fact,
they
will
say
anything
that
suits
their
purposes.
we
don't
trust
securities
arbitration.
if
mr.
krebsbach
were
to
go
outside
in
the
hall
and
offer
to
enter
into
an
agreement
to
arbitrate
that
wasn't
an
sro
arbitration,
we'd
be
much
more
inclined
to
do
so.
we
think
that
the
worst
possible
option
for
investors
is
to
be
thrown
into
sro
arbitration.
and
also,
it's
true
that
really,
that
these
are
just
part
of
the
problems
that
are
affecting
this
whole
industry.
and
as
the
court
has
noted,
there
are
other
problems
in
the
commodities
field,
and
they
are
sooner
or
later
going
to
have
to
be
addressed
here
as
well.
we
think
that
the
intent
of
congress
is
clear
and,
though
it
may
be
inconvenient
to
split
the
claims,
if
we
are
true
to
what
the
cases
have
said,
we
look
at
each
individual
statute
and
we
decide
what
in
fact
the
congressional
intent
was.
that
decision
was
made
in
1953
by
the
wilko
court
and
this
court
should
adhere
to
that
decision.
thank
you.
