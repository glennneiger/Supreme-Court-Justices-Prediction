justice
o'connor
mr.
downey,
is
there
any
evidence
that
congress
meant
to
treat
claims
under
section
12(2)
differently
than
claims
under
section
10(b)?
do
we
have
anything
in
the
legislative
history
to
indicate
that
congress
intended
them
to
be
treated
differently,
even
though
they
were
not
enacted
at
the
same
time?
justice
o'connor
mr.
downey,
did
you
raise
the
adhesion
argument
below?
justice
o'connor
was
that
ever
addressed
below?
justice
o'connor
you
make
another
argument,
don't
you,
that
regardless
of
what
this
court
does,
if
we
were
to
disagree
with
you
about
the
validity
today
of
wilko
and
were
to
reject
that
now,
i
take
it
you
argue
that
in
any
event
it
shouldn't
be
applied
to
your
clients?
justice
o'connor
you
think
it
would
not
be
retroactive
under
a
chevron
analysis?
justice
o'connor
these
agreements
were
signed
before
mcmahon
was
decided?
justice
o'connor
the
petitioner
takes
the
view,
mr.
krebsbach,
that
even
if
it
is
overruled
that
it
shouldn't
apply
retroactively
to
these
petitioners.
justice
o'connor
but
this
was
signed,
these
agreements
were
signed,
before
mcmahon
was
decided,
were
they
not?
justice
o'connor
well,
that's
a
little
hard
to
justify
under
chevron,
isn't
it?
justice
o'connor
let
me
ask
you
this.
under
the
predispute
arbitration
agreements
in
this
case,
would
the
arbitration
have
to
take
place
in
new
york
or
texas?
justice
o'connor
you
would
concede
that
it
could
occur
under
these
agreements
in
texas,
notwithstanding
the
provisions
of
the
agreement?
