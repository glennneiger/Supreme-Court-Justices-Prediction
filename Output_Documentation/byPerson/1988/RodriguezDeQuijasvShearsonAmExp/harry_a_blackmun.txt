but
it
stood
alone
a
long
time.
justice
blackmun
and
congress
didn't
act.
justice
blackmun
why
do
you
think
congress
hasn't
acted,
in
view
of
what
you
just
said?
justice
blackmun
going
back
to
the
baseball
cases,
congress
didn't
act
and
we
chose
not
to.
why
should
we
do
any
different
here?
justice
blackmun
really,
your
argument
is
that
the
arbitration
process
is
now
a
process
of
integrity,
and
that
we
should
recognize
that
fact
and
incidentally
take
a
burden
off
the
federal
courts,
isn't
it?
justice
blackmun
maybe
that's
the
real
reason.
justice
blackmun
you
can't
be
too
proud
of
some
of
the
things
that
have
happened
in
the
street
in
the
past
decade,
can
you?
