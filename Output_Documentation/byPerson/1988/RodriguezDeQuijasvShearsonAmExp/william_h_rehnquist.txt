william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
83-385,
ofelia
rodriguez
de
quijas,
et
al.,
versus
shearson/american
express.
chief
justice
rehnquist
certainly
we
would
have
to
reconsider
some
of
our
recent
cases
to
adopt
that
view,
wouldn't
we,
mr.
downey?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
by
hypothesis
there
was
no
overreaching
or
at
least
no
fraud
in
the
agreement
to
arbitrate.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
didn't
the
lower
courts
here
at
least
find
that
the
agreement
to
arbitrate
was
an
agreement,
a
valid
agreement?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
fifth
circuit,
mr.
downey,
in
its
opinion
says
that
you
didn't
contest
the
arbitrability
of
your
exchange
act
claims
following
mcmahon.
now,
you
didn't
make
an
adhesion
argument
with
respect
to
the
exchange
act
claims?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
it
sounds
at
least
from
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion
as
if
you
didn't
make
any
claim
that
there
simply
wasn't
any
contract
under
the
exchange
act
claim.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
downey.

stand
for?

regulatory

thank
you,
mr.
krebsbach.
mr.

do
you

rebuttal?
