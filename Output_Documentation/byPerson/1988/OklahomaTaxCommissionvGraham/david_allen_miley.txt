mr.
david
allen
miley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
today
this
court
is
asked
to
decide
whether
an
indian
tribe
is
answerable
in
state
court
for
ignoring
its
obligation
to
collect
and
remit
taxes
to
the
state
of
oklahoma
despite
this
court's
sanction
of
state
laws
imposing
such
obligations.
the
tax
commission
brought
this
action
in
state
district
court
to
enjoin
the
chickasaw
nation
from
operating
a
motel
business
until
all
taxes
were
collected
and
remitted
to
the
state
in
compliance
with
state
tax
laws.
the
tribe
removed
this
case
to
the
federal
court,
and
that
court
denied
the
state's
motion
to
remand
on
the
basis
that
a
suit
against
an
indian
tribe
is
a
federal
matter.
after
assuming
jurisdiction,
the
federal
court
then
dismissed
the
state's
case
holding
that
an
indian
tribe
cannot
be
sued
without
its
consent
under
the
indian
sovereignty
doctrine.
in
affirming
these
decisions,
the
tenth
circuit
ruled
that
an
indian
tribe
enjoys
absolute
sovereign
immunity
within
its
territory
and
thereby
foreclosed
the
state's
right
to
have
its
valid
taxes
collected.
the
first
question
we
ask
this
court
to
consider
is
whether
removal
jurisdiction
exists
in
this
case.
the
state
submits
that
federal
removal
jurisdiction
does
not
exist
because
the
state's
lawsuit
is
not
based
on
federal
law
to
any
extent,
but
only
alleges
violations
of
state
law
to
which
the
tax
commission
requests
relief
provided
by
state
law.
the
respondent
urges
that
its
status
as
an
indian
tribe
creates
a
federal
cause
of
action
that
is
properly
removable.
however,
this
court
has
held
in
the
mescalero
apache
tribe
opinion
in
1973
that
the
federal
government
does
not
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
an
indian
tribe
for
all
purposes
and
that
the
encouragement
for
tribal
economic
development
under
the
indian
reorganization
act
does
not
establish
a
tribal
business
as
an
arm
of
the
government
and,
therefore,
off
reservation
activity
is
within
the
reach
of
state
law.
but
the
heart
of
the
matter
is
that
the
tax
commission's
complaint
properly
pleads
a
cause
of
action
to
collect
state
taxes
which
is
based
exclusively
on
state
law,
as
it
must
be.
the
tribe
may
raise
substantial
federal
questions
in
defense
of
the
state's
claim,
but
federal
questions
in
a
defensive
argument
cannot
serve
as
a
basis
for
federal
removal
jurisdiction.
under
the
well
pleaded
complaint
rule,
a
federal
statute
or
a
substantial
question
of
federal
law
must
be
the
basis
of
the
plaintiff's
claim
rather
than
a
basis
of
the
defendant's
defense.
and,
therefore,
this
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
state
district
court.
but
beyond
the
issue
of
removal
jurisdiction,
this
case
concerns
whether
the
indian
sovereignty
doctrine
bars
the
state's
lawsuit.
mr.
david
allen
miley
you
would
not
get
to
that
question,
and
the
state
would
have
to
decide
if
that
was
a
proper
defense
to
the
state's
actions.
the
state
district
court
would
have
to
determine
if
that
was
a
valid
defense
so
that
once
the
removal
issue
is...
is
decided
in
the
state's
favor,
we
would
not
have
to
determine
whether
the
state's
case
should
be
dismissed
based
on
indian
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
david
allen
miley
the
state
court
may
have
to
make
that
decision,
but
the
state
court
has
already
made
that
decision.
in
another
case
the
state
supreme
court
has
ruled
in
the
state
ex
rel.
may
versus
seneca-cayuga
tribe...
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
ruled
that
the
indian
sovereignty
doctrine
does
not
bar
the
state's
lawsuit.
so
that
if
this
case
was
remanded
to
the
state
court,
the
case
would
be
tried
on
the
merits.
mr.
david
allen
miley
that--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--that
is
correct.
so
that
the
indian
sovereignty
doctrine
at
this
point
only
comes
into
play
if
the
state
loses
on
the
removal
jurisdiction
argument.
and
i
feel
that
that
is
a
fairly
clear-cut
argument
in
that
the
indian
tribe
is
not
a
part
of
the
federal
government.
the
activity
is
off-reservation,
and
i
feel
that
under
the
mescalero
case
and
under
moe
versus
the
confederated
tribes
cons...
under
the
moe
decision
and
the
colville
decision,
i
believe,
whether...
whether
the
business
activity
is
on
or
off
of
a
reservation,
this
court
has
ruled
that
the
state
does
have
a
right
to
have
its...
its
valid
taxes
collected.
mr.
david
allen
miley
yes.
mr.
david
allen
miley
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
allen
miley
no.
it...
it
alleges
that
the
state
laws
were
violated
by
this
motel
operation
and
sues
the
owners
and
operators
of
the
motel.
mr.
david
allen
miley
no,
you
cannot
because...
because
that
wasn't
developed.
no
evidence
was
developed
in
the
case.
mr.
david
allen
miley
that
alleges
that
taxes
are
owed.
mr.
david
allen
miley
yes.
mr.
david
allen
miley
no,
there's
no
reservations
in
oklahoma,
so...
i
believe
that
was...
that
has
been
briefed
throughout
the
case
because
many
times
it
is
necessary
to--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--yes.
we
contend
that
is...
that
it
is...
the
tribes
in
oklahoma
have
been
assimilated
rather
than
operate
under
the
reservation
system.
mr.
david
allen
miley
yes.
this--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--it...
well,
it
is
not
on
an
allotment
as
defined
in
title
18
united
states
code
1151(c)
because
the
indian
title
to
this
particular
piece
of
land
was
extinguished,
and
it
did
go
into
non-indian
ownership.
this
tribe
did
purchase
this
particular
motel
property
in
1972
and
in
1985
under
title
25
u.s.c.
section
501,
which
allows
transfer
of
lands
acquired
by
tribes
to
the
united
states
in
trust
for
the
benefit
of
the
tribe,
this
land
was
placed
in
trust
with
the
united
states
for
the
tribe's
benefit.
however,
as
this
court
has
ruled
in
the
mescalero
opinion,
the
transfer
in
trust
does
not
create
indian
country
which...
which
many
of
the
cases
involving
the
allocation
of
jurisdiction
between
the
state
and
a
tribe
consists
of
so
that...
so
that
this
piece
of
property,
although
it
is
held
in
trust,
that
statute
did
not
create
any
broad
exemptions
from
taxes
or
regulation
that
all
other
businesses
throughout
the
state
are
subject
to.
therefore...
going
on
with
my...
i
think
i've
fairly
well
said
all
i
can
about
the...
the
removal
question
which...
which
may
determine
the
outcome
presently.
mr.
david
allen
miley
i
believe
they
do
have
authority
to
waive
immunity
from
suit.
mr.
david
allen
miley
i
am
not
aware
of
a
case
that
establishes
their
ability
to
waive,
but
they
have
not
made
a
waiver
in
this
case.
mr.
david
allen
miley
however,
i
don't
think
the
waiver
is
necessary
because
their
sovereignty
does
not
extend
that
far,
does
not
extend
over
the
state's
lawsuit.
mr.
david
allen
miley
yes.
mr.
david
allen
miley
i...
i'm
assuming
that
it
can
be
waive.
i
didn't...
i
believe
they
do
have
sovereign
immunity
over
their
internal
relations
such
that
tribal
rites,
say,
a
tribal
member
or
a
person
wanting
to
establish
tribal
membership
was
denied
for
some
reason.
the
tribe...
that
would
be
a
relationship
internal
to
the
tribe,
but
they
would
have
plenary
authority
over
and
a
suit
against
the
tribe
on
that
issue
may
not
be
maintained
because
of
the
tribe's
sovereign
immunity.
however,
when
the
tribe
operates
a
business
in
the...
it...
it
steps
outside
the
reach
or
that...
their
internal...
their
sphere
of
internal
jurisdiction
or
internal
relations
and
steps
into
the
reach
of
state
law
so
that
the
tribe
may
properly
allege
a
cause
of
action
against
them
to
collect
taxes
when
the
tribe
chooses
to
enter
the
business
community.
so
that
their
sovereign
immunity
is
not
a
question
at
that
point.
it
is
raised
in
defense,
but
i
contend
that
it's
not
a
valid
defense.
mr.
david
allen
miley
i
believe
it
does.
it
completely
occupies
the
field,
and
the
tenth
circuit
has
also
held
that
the
state
of
oklahoma
cannot
tax
indian
bingo
operations,
and,
therefore,
we
are--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--that
it
is
not
retroactive?
mr.
david
allen
miley
well,
this
is
a
motel.
this
is
a
motel
business.
a
bingo
operation
was...
was
operated
there,
plus
a
restaurant.
however,
the
state
sales
tax
applies
against
the
rental
of
motel
rooms.
it
applies
against
restaurant
sales.
mr.
david
allen
miley
no,
not
at
this
point.
we
did
allege
that
taxes
were
owed
on
the
bingo
operation.
mr.
david
allen
miley
that
was
part
of
the
complaint
and
now
that
is
foreclosed,
so
when
we
do
reach
the
merits
of
this
case,
bingo
sales
will
not
be
a
part
of
the
effort
to
tax
in
this
case.
mr.
david
allen
miley
because
of
the
new
indian
gaming
regulatory
act.
mr.
david
allen
miley
not
it
doesn't,
but
we
have
not
collected
any
taxes
from
the
bingo
operations
thus
far,
and
the
tenth
circuit
in
the
creek
nation...
oklahoma
tax
commission
versus
the
creek
nation...
held
that
we
could
not
tax
bingo
sales.
so--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--well,
i...
i
suppose
i
am
interpreting
the
current
law
as
it
stands
in
that
now
we
will
not
be
able
to
assert
that
cause.
mr.
david
allen
miley
yes.
yes,
it
is
out
of
this
case
right
now.
so,
the...
as
far
as
the...
these
tribes'
sovereign
immunity,
the
state
does
recognize
that
the
tribe
does
have
a
tribal
government
and
can
tax
its
own
sales.
however,
these
taxes
do
not
displace
or
preempt
the
state
taxes,
but
the
state
aria
the
tribe
can
tax
the
same
transactions,
but
that
really
goes
more
to
the...
the
merits
of
the
case,
but
really
the...
what
the
point
is
is
that
the
indian
sovereignty
doctrine
does
not
bar
the
state's
suit
because
that
doctrine
has
been
adjusted
to
accommodate
the
state's
legitimate
interest
in
taxing
its
citizens,
and
i
do
not
feel
that
this...
the
state's
interest...
i
feel
that
the
state's
interest
could
be
fulfilled
by
the
tribe's
business
enterprise,
and
the
tribe
could
fulfill
their
interests
in
the
economic
development
of
their
business
because
the
state
tax
will
not
prevent
the
tribe
from
sustaining
their
economic
development,
just
as
it
does
not
prevent
all
other
businesses
from
making
a
profit
in
the
state.
but
if
the
state
cannot
rely
on
the
decisions
of
this
court
which
i
feel
recognize
the
state's
right
to
have
its
taxes
collected
from
its
citizens,
then
the
state's
right
to
have
this
tribe
collect
the
tax
and
remit
it
will
be
lost
forever
if
the
tenth
circuit
decision
stands
because
the
tribe
has
expressed
that
regardless
of
the
merits
of
the
case,
they
do
not
intend
to
collect
the
state's
taxes,
and
if
they
can
successfully
avoid
a
lawsuit,
by
asserting
sovereign
immunity
in
a
federal
court,
they
do
not
feel
compelled
to...
to
abide
by
state
law
and
collect
the
state's
taxes.
so
that
in
that
case,
whole
areas
of
state
taxation
will
be
put
beyond
the
reach
of
state
jurisdiction,
and
the
state
taxing
system
will
necessarily
be
restructured
by
the
tenth
circuit's
opinion
in
that
regard
because
we
will
not
be--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--no,
the
merits...
but
the
merits
are
bound
up
in
the...
the...
the
sovereign
immunity
of
tribe,
and
i
feel
that
if
the
state
has
its
right...
has
a
right,
it
must
also
have
the
ability
to
enforce
that
right
against
the
tribe.
mr.
david
allen
miley
well,
you
wouldn't
have
to
address
it
if...
if
the
defense
of
sovereign
immunity
is
not
a
valid
defense,
because
it
would
have
to
go
back
down
for
trial
at
that
point.
so
that
to...
to
conclude
this
argument,
i...
i
think
from
reading
the
cases,
the
trend
in
this
court
has
been
away
from
the
idea
of
inherent
indian
sovereignty
and
toward
reliance
on...
on
federal
preemption
or
on
infringement
of
tribal
government.
so
that
when
state
action
is
not...
is
not
preempted
or
infringed,
that
the...
the
requirements
under
state
tax
laws
may
validly
be
imposed
against
the
tribe
and
necessarily
since
taxes
are...
are
enforced,
are
complied
with
voluntarily,
but
are
enforced
principally,
the
only...
the
only
avenue
we
have
to
enforce
is...
is
the
state
courts
because,
of
course,
the
federal
government
does
not
enforce
state
laws.
and
without
that...
without
enforcement
we...
we
see
that
we
cannot...
if
we
cannot
come
to
court
to...
to
have
our
rights
vindicated,
then
the
state
will
have
lost
its...
lost
its
rights.
if
the
court
doesn't
have
any
further
questions.
mr.
david
allen
miley
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
all
i
would
want
to
say
is
to
sum
up
that
i
believe
the
caterpillar
case
is
controlling
on
the
well
pleaded
complaint
rule,
and
this
should
dispose
of
the
issues,
but
in
the
mescalero
case
it
was
ruled
there
on...
which
was
here
on
cert.
from
the
state
court
of
new
mexico...
that
the
federal
law...
the
federal
government
does
not
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
the
tribe
for
all
purposes
and,
therefore,
the
state's
revenue
laws
can
be
properly
applied
against
the
tribal
enterprise
which
is...
and
i
believe
that
that
case
is
controlling
because
it
is
indistinguishable
in
terms
of
the
status
of
the
land
involved
and
the
business
being
operated.
and
i
would...
if
the
court
has
no
other
questions,
i'm
through.
