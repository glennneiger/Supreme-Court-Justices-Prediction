justice
o'connor
counsel,
does
the
new
indian
gaming
regulatory
act
complete
foreclose
future
efforts
by
oklahoma
to
tax
indian
bingo
games?
justice
o'connor
but
it's
not
retroactive,
i
take
it?
justice
o'connor
this
new
act?
does
it
cover
your
case
so
that
this
new
act
precludes
this--
justice
o'connor
--the
state
isn't
trying
to
tax
any
of
the
bingo
operation?
justice
o'connor
i
thought
that
was
part
of
the
complaint.
justice
o'connor
well,
that's
not
the
issue
before
us,
is
it,
the
merits
of
whether--
justice
o'connor
--i
just
don't
see
why
we
have
to
address
that
at
all.
justice
o'connor
well,
what
if
the
suit...
there
were
a
state
brought
against
a
state
anti
the
state
wanted
to
assert
11th
amendment
immunity?
that's
no
more
than
a
defense,
isn't
it?
wouldn't
you
have
to
get
into
federal
court
or
to
be
removed
into
federal
court?
wouldn't
you
have
to
have
some
other
basis
under
federal
law
to
get
there
other
than
the
11th
immunity
defense?
why
isn't
this
exactly
the
same?
justice
o'connor
right.
justice
o'connor
there's
no
case
for
that
proposition
that,
i
know
of.
can
you
cite
me
one?
justice
o'connor
counsel,
there
is
no
reservation
today,
is
there?
justice
o'connor
well,
presumably
the
oklahoma
courts
are
competent
to
deal
with
that
question,
at
least
initially,
and
subject
to
ultimately
being
reviewed
here?
justice
o'connor
presumably
the
federal
statute
that's
been
enacted
speaks
to
that
question.
