mr.
bob
rabon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
i
might,
i
would
like
to
respond
to
a
question
that
justice
kennedy
asked,
i
believe,
regarding
whether
or
not
the
tribe
had
waived
its
sovereign
immunity
or
whether
it
can
waive
its
sovereign
immunity
and
whether
or
not
this
court
has
held
whether
it
can.
the
tribe
here
has
not
waived
its
sovereign
immunity
from
suit.
i
know
of
no
decision
of
this
court
that
holds
that
a
tribe
can
waive
its
sovereign
immunity
absent
some
act
of
congress.
mr.
bob
rabon
nor
that
it
can't.
i
think
there's...
i
don't
recall
the
citation,
but
i
think
there's
a
ninth
circuit
court
case
that
says
that
they
can.
i'm
not
sure
about
that,
and
don't
have
the
citation.
mr.
bob
rabon
well,
we
don't
view
it
in
that
light.
we
see
the...
the
fact
that
a
complaint
is
filed
in
state
court
against
an
indian
tribe
asserting
the
right
to
apply
state
tax
laws,
asserting
coercive
state
civil
jurisdiction,
impliedly
asserting
an
abrogation
of
sovereign
immunity,
we
see
those
as
affirmative
matters
and
not
necessarily
matters
that
should
be
raised
on...
by
defense.
mr.
bob
rabon
i
think
that
the...
i
think
that
it
would
be
incumbent
upon
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
to
allege...
when
you
have
a
state
as
a
party
defendant--
mr.
bob
rabon
--to
allege
the
authority
to...
and
that's
happening
in
this
case.
mr.
bob
rabon
no,
your
honor.
mr.
bob
rabon
that
is
one
test.
mr.
bob
rabon
well,
in
the
case
of
gulley
versus
first
national
bank,
the
court,
justice
cardoza,
said
that
there
were
other
criteria,
standards
for
removal
of
jurisdiction
that
you
look
to,
such
as
the
probable
course
of
the
trial,
the
real
substance
of
the
case.
he
said
that
while
a
suit
to
enforce
a
right
or
rights
with
origins
under...
with
their
origins
in
federal
law
may
not
necessarily
be
federal
unless
it
really
and
substantially
involves
a
dispute
or
controversy
respecting
the
validity,
construction
or
effect
of
such
law
upon
which
the
determination
of
which
the
result
depends.
mr.
bob
rabon
that
assumes
that
the
state
can
create
a
cause
of
action
against
an
indian
tribe,
and
we
don't
think
that
they
can.
in
caterpillar--
mr.
bob
rabon
--if
the
well
pleaded
complaint
rule
governs
and...
and
the
well
pleaded
complaint
does
not
raise
or
present
substantial
federal
questions,
and
i
believe
that's
what
he
court
said
in
franchise
tax
board
and
caterpillar
versus
williams.
mr.
bob
rabon
yes.
i
say...
i
say
that...
i
say
that
the
state's...
the
very
right
to
assert
the
claims
that
the
state
asserts
are
vested
in...
are
bottomed
in
federal
law.
mr.
bob
rabon
federal
common
law.
mr.
bob
rabon
well,
in
oneida
in
the--
mr.
bob
rabon
--well,
the
power
of
congress
with
regard
to...
with
regard
to
whether
or
not
an
indian
tribe
may
be
sued
in
the
first
instance
is
plenary.
mr.
bob
rabon
well,
if
the
well
pleaded
complaint
rule
were
to...
were
to
apply
in
this
particular
case,
we
still
submit
that
the
case
is
completely
preempted
by...
by
federal
law
and
the
areas
that
are
raised
by...
inherently
in
the
complaint
are
completely
preempted
by
federal
law.
we--
mr.
bob
rabon
--as
i
recall--
mr.
bob
rabon
--we
think
that
when
you
name
an
indian
tribe
a
federally
recognized
and
protected
indian
tribe
and
a
state
asserts
the
right
to
apply
its...
its
laws
and
to...
to
assert
coercive
state
civil
jurisdiction
over
it,
that
the
complaint
inherently
presents
federal
questions,
substantial
federal
questions.
the
state
cannot...
i've
said
this
before,
but
we
just
don't
see
how
the
state
can
create
the
right
in
itself
to
assert
these
claims.
and
in
the
onelda
case,
the
court
said
that
you
look
to
the
underlying
right,
the
underlying
right
asserted.
in
this
case
we
believe
that
the
petition
inherently
asserts
the
right
to
limit
aspects
of
the
chickasaw
nation's
sovereignty.
in
national
farmers
insurance
company
versus
crow
tribe,
the
court
said
in
that
case
where
the
complaint
asserts
the
right
to
curtail
or
limit
a
tribe's
or
aspects
of
a
tribe's
sovereignty,
that
it
arises
out
of
federal
law
for
purposes
of
13...
section
1331.
and,
of
course,
the
test
for
1331
and
the
removal
test
under
1441
are
the
same.
but,
in
any
event,
we
contend
that...
that
the
complete
preemption
rule
applies
here
because
the...
the...
the
congress
has
completely
dominated
and
indicated
its
intent
to
govern
the
field
of
tribal
sovereign
immunity
and
state
civil
jurisdiction.
with
regard
to
the
area
of
state
civil
jurisdiction
the
congress
has
allowed
the
states
to
have
jurisdiction
with
great
care
and
selectivity.
in
1953
the...
and
incidentally,
the
congress
has
shown
that
it
knows
how
to
grant
the
states
civil
jurisdiction.
in
1953
an
example
would
be
public
law
280
and
its
1968
amendments.
in
wold
engineering
versus
three
tribes
the...
this
court
described
public
law
280
as
a
comprehensive
and
detailed
scheme,
the
primary
expression
of
federal
policy
and
that
it
preempts
incompatible
state
action.
oklahoma
is
not
a
public
law
280
state.
certainly
the
attempt
by
the
oklahoma
tax
commission
to
assert
state
court
civil
jurisdiction
over
an
indian
tribe
in
that...
in
that
state
is
incompatible
with
public
law
280.
another
example
of...
when
congress
has
allowed
civil
jurisdiction
over
indian
tribes
is
the
termination
acts
of
1954,
making
certain
tribes
subject
to
the
laws
of
the
states
at
the
time
they
terminated
those
tribes'
federal
status.
congress
has
also
exhibited
a...
a...
its
domination
in
the
area
of
whether
or
not
tribal
sovereign
immunity
is
abrogated.
it
has
shown
that
it
will
only
abrogate
tribal
sovereign
immunity,
again,
with
great
care
and
very
infrequently.
as
it
relates
to
the
chickasaw
nation,
we
know
of
only
three
times
that
it
specifically
has
abrogated
the
chickasaw
nation's
sovereign
immunity,
and
that
would
be
in
the
curtis
act
of
1898...
there
was
a
limited
abrogation
there...
the
five
tribes
act
of
1906,
where
it
allowed
certain
counterclaims
and
actions
that
were...
that
were
pending
where
the
tribes
were...
were
plaintiffs.
in
public
law
93-195
in
1975
when
the
choctaw
and
chickasaw
nations
and
the
cherokee
nations
were
allowed
to
sue
each
other
to
determine
the
respective
ownerships
of
the
arkansas
river
beds,
as
related
to
the
indian
tribes
generally,
the
indian
civil
rights
act
of
1968
allows
for
habeas
corpus
relief
only.
recently
in
the
indian
gaming
regulatory
act
of
1988
the
congress
allowed
certain
actions
arising
out
of
the
compacts
that...
that
states
and
tribes
might
enter
into
to
be
the
subject
of
suits
against
tribes.
moreover,
congress
has
reemphasized
its
commitment
to
tribal
sovereign
immunity
in
the
indian
self-determination
act
of
1975
where
it
said
that
there
was
nothing
in
that
act
should
be
construed
as
affecting,
modifying,
diminishing,
or
otherwise
impairing
the
sovereign
immunity
from
suit
enjoyed
by
indian
tribes.
another
federal
area
in
which
state
law
is
completely
displaced
is
the
treaties
that
the
united
states
government
has
entered
into
with
the
chickasaw
nation.
in
1832
the
preamble
of
the...
of
that
treaty
with
the
chickasaw
nation
showed
that
the
principal
consideration
for
removal
was
to
escape
state
laws
which
oppressed
the
chickasaw
nation.
in
1834
when
the
chickasaw
nation
finally
did
agree
to
remove,
the
principal
consideration
that
the
tribe
advanced
in
that
matter
was,
again,
to
escape
state
laws,
and
the
federal
government
promised
to
protect
them
from
inroads
from
the
whites.
in
1837
the
choc...
the
chickasaws
acquired
their
present
reservation
from
the
choctaws.
that
treaty
provided
that
the
chickasaws
would
hold
that
reservation
on
the
same
terms
and
conditions
as
the
choctaws
held
it.
the
choctaws
acquired
that
reservation
under
the
treaty
to
dancing
rabbit
creek
in
1830,
and
when
they
acquired
those
lands,
the
united
states
government
promised
them
that
they
would
not
allow
any
state
to
pass
laws
for
the
tribe
or
its
descendants.
here
the
state
is
clearly
invoking
its
laws
against
the
tribe.
mr.
bob
rabon
we
take
the
position
that
the
reservation
boundaries
in
oklahoma
have,
with
the
exception
of
two
indian
tribes
that
we
know
of,
have
never
been
abolished
by
congress.
but
even
if
they
had
been,
indian
country
within
areas
where
the
reservation
boundaries
had
been
abolished
or
the
reservation
has
been
diminished
continues
to
be
under
federal
and
tribal
jurisdiction.
finally,
oklahoma's
enabling
act
conditioned
its
becoming
a
state
on
its
disclaiming
any
jurisdiction
to
limit
the
rights
of
persons
or
property
pertaining
to
the
indians
of
said
territory.
we
think
that
the
decisions
of
this
court,
the
active
involvement
of
the
congress,
and
these
treaty
rights
completely
preempt
the
state
law
cause
of
action
asserted
by
the
state
of
oklahoma
here,
and
that
this
case
was
properly
removed.
of
course,
the
trial
court
dismissed
this
case
because
there
was
no
affirmative
showing
of
a
waiver
of
the
tribe's
sovereign
immunity,
but...
and
we
think
that
the
court
was
correct.
perhaps
it
would
have
been
more
correctly
decided
had
it
determined
what
the
state
court's
jurisdiction
was
for
purposes
of
determining
whether
or
not
there
was
derivative
jurisdiction
that
was
necessary
at
the
time
this
case
was
removed,
prior
to
the
1986
amendment
of
the
removal
statute.
and
had
it
done
that,
we
feel
that
it
would
have
determined
that
the
state
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction
and
that
dismissal,
as
was
mandated
by
lambert
run
coal
company
versus
baltimore
&
ohio
railroad
mandated
dismissal
as
opposed
to
remand.
we
think
that
under
either
theory
the
result
was
correct.
we...
i
would
like
to
take
issue
with...
with
one
question
that
counsel...
one
statement
that
counsel
made
that...
that
it
is
the
tribe's
assertion
that
it
does
not
have
to
collect
any
cigarette
taxes
in
this
case.
you
only
have
to
look
at
the
complaint.
the
complaint
seeks...
it
makes
no
distinction
between
tribal
members
and
non-tribal
members.
and
as
i
understand
the
decision
in
colville
and
moe
and
chamenuevi
that
this
court
has
only
held
that
the
tribes
are
required
to
collect
those
taxes
as
they
relate
to
non-tribal
members,
certainly
my
client
does
not
believe
that
it
has
a
right
to...
to
defy
this
court's
decision
in
that
regard.
but
that's
not
what
the
state
is
asking
for
here.
the
state
is
asking
for
much
broader
relief.
and
as
you
see,
as
you
read
into
their...
read
their...
their
briefs
and
the
position
that
they've
taken
that
no
indian
tribe
in
oklahoma
has
any
immunities
left.
mr.
bob
rabon
yes,
and
if
this
case
was
improperly
removed
and
it
is
remanded
back
to
the
state
court,
the
state
court
would
get
that
opportunity.
but
we
feel
that...
that
because
of
the
complete
preemption
doctrine
that
we
had
the
prerogative
and
that
to
remove
this
case
to
federal
court.
quite
frankly
we
removed
this
case
to
federal
court
because
of
the
case
cited
by
the
tax
commission,
which
was
decided
only
about
three
months
before
this
case
was
pass...
was
filed,
and
that
is
may
ex
rel.
oklahoma
tax
commission
versus
seneca-cayuga
tribe,
where
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
held
that
the
state
courts
had
the
right
to
regulate
bingo
gaming
on
indian
country
in
oklahoma--
mr.
bob
rabon
--the
court
also
held
in
that
case
that
the
tribe
did
not
have
sovereign
immunity
from
suit
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
that
indicated
that
the
tribe
had
waived
sovereign
immunity
or
that
congress
has
waived
the
tribe's
sovereign
immunity
from
suit.
that
case
subsequently
was
sent
back
to
the
state
court
for
trial
and
was
enjoined
by
the
federal
district
court
in
the
northern
district
of
oklahoma
from
proceeding
further.
mr.
bob
rabon
that
case,
i
believe,
is
on
appeal
to
the
tenth
circuit
at
this
time.
mr.
bob
rabon
no,
i'm
not...
i'm
not
contending
that.
we
continue
to
take
the
position
that...
that
the
issues
presented
when
the
state
asserts
the
rights
that
it
asserted
here
against
an
indian
tribe
in
state
court
inherently
present
substantial
federal
questions
and
are
completely
preempted.
mr.
bob
rabon
yes.
mr.
bob
rabon
that
the
right,
the--
mr.
bob
rabon
--it's
asserting
a
federal
claim
to
to
assert
its
tax
laws
against
the
tribe
is
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
bob
rabon
in
onelda,
i
believe
the
court
found
that
the
complaint
only
alleged
a
state
law
cause
of
action
in
ejectment,
but
that
the
underlying
right
to
assert
that...
that
cause
of
action
had
its
origins
in
federal
law.
mr.
bob
rabon
perhaps...
perhaps
i've
misinterpreted
what
the
court
has
said
there,
but
the
way
i
interpreted
that
decision
was
that
in
that
case,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
complaint
only
alleged
a
state
law
cause
of
action...
and
that's
what
the
court
said
there,
that
it
only
alleged
a
state
law
cause
of
action
in
ejectment...
the
underlying
right
to
assert
that
was
based
on
federal
law.
mr.
bob
rabon
yes.
mr.
bob
rabon
no,
i
don't.
except
in
that
case
the
court
said
that
there
was
no
federal
statute
which
made
new
york's
statutory
or
decisional
law
applicable
to
an
indian
tribe
and,
therefore,
the
governing
rule
of
law
would
be
fashioned
in
the
mode
of
the
federal
common
law,
as
i
understand.
i
think
i
have
correctly
quote
that
from
the
decision.
but
we
still
submit
that...
that
anytime
the
state
sues
a
federally
recognized
indian
tribe
asserting
these
rights
that
it...
that's
been
asserted
here,
that
it...
it
raises
issues
that
are
completely
preempted
by
federal
law.
i
might...
in
closing,
i
would
like
to...
to
address
one
other
statement
that
was
made
by...
counsel
cited
to...
to
mescalero
apache
versus
jones.
in
that
case
sovereign
immunity
from
suit
was
not
at
issue,
and
the
tribe
submitted
itself
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
conclude
my
argument
at
this
time.
