justice
scalia
why
is
that?
justice
scalia
does
that
say
that
it's
retroactive,
that
it
applies
retroactively?
justice
scalia
we
have
a
line
of
decision
that
says
you
decide
the
case
on
the
basis
of
current
law,
and
that's
the
current
law.
but
we
have
another
line
of
decision
that
says
that
laws
are
not
normally
to
be
interpreted
to
be
retroactive.
and
i'm
just
wondering
which
of
the
two
lines
you
were
using
here.
justice
scalia
you're
not
asserting.
that's
out
of
this
case?
justice
scalia
the
problem
is--
justice
scalia
--the
problem
is
that
it...
that
it
isn't
just
the
areas
raised
in
the
complaint
that
have
to
be
preempted.
i
mean,
the
complaint
may
on
its
face
suggest
a
particular
defense.
it
has
to
be
the
claim
that
has
to
be
a
federal
claim.
and
that's
what
i
find
it
hard
to
see
in
this
complaint.
how
is
there
a
federal
claim?
the
only
federal
claim
you're
suggesting
is
that
well,
the
state
claim
would
not
exist
if
the
federal
congress
chose
to
eliminate
it.
but,
gee,
you
could
say
that
about
almost
any
state
complaint.
congress
could
preempt
almost
any
state
action
in
the
world.
so,
in
a
way,
it's
a
condition
to
any
state
cause
of
action
that
congress
has
chosen
not
to
preempt
it.
but
we
don't
say
that
every
state
cause
of
action
is
thereby
a
federal
cause
of
action
because
it's
only
by
the
good
will
of
congress
that
the
state
action
continues
to
exist.
why
is
that
different
from
what
you're
arguing
here?
justice
scalia
well,
i
can
understand
why
you
wanted
to
be
out
of
the
oklahoma
state
courts,
but
just
because
you
see
an
opinion
of
the
oklahoma
state
courts
that
you
don't
like
and
you
figure
well,
it's
useless
litigating...
useless
litigating
here,
that
doesn't
necessarily
give
you
a
right
to
go
into
federal
court.
i
mean
some--
justice
scalia
--it's
a
federal
claim,
is
that
what
you're
contending--
justice
scalia
--that
it
is
a
federal
claim,
not
the
issues
presented,
but
it
is
a
federal
claim
that--
justice
scalia
--oklahoma
was
asserting
a
federal
claim
when
it
sought
to
collect
state
taxes
is
what
you're
telling
us.
justice
scalia
i
mean,
what
we
said
in
onelda,
which...
which
you
quote
to
us,
is
that
it
was
a
federal
claim
that
was
being
asserted,
and
that's
what
you
have
to
establish
here,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
attempt
to
collect
state
taxes
is
a
federal
claim.
that's
a
pretty
hard
thing
to
establish,
i
think.
justice
scalia
i
think
what
we
said
is
that
enough
has
been
said
to
indicate
that
the
complaint
in
this
case
asserts
a
present
right
to
possession
under
federal
law.
we
found
a
federal
claim
being
asserted
there.
justice
scalia
we
said
elsewhere
accepting
the
premise
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
case
was
essentially
a
possessory
action,
we
are
of
the
view
that
the
complaint
asserted
a
current
right
to
possession
conferred
by
federal
law,
wholly
independent
of
state
law.
is
that
the
case
in
which
the
complaint
alleged
a
violation
of
the
non-intercourse
act,
the
federal
statute?
that
was
the
basis
for--
--i
believe
that's
correct.
so,
they're
affirmatively
relying
on
a
federal
statute.
