justice
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you?
you
said
that
this...
this
incident,
this
business
is
conducted
off
the
reservation.
justice
stevens
and
the
record
in
the
case
consists
just
of
the
complaint,
doesn't
it?
justice
stevens
and
does
the
complaint
allege
that
the...
that
the...
this
murray...
whatever
it
is...
sulphur,
oklahoma,
is...
is
or
is
not
within
the
reservation?
i
don't
think
the
complaint
says
one
way
or
another.
justice
stevens
but
what
i
mean
is
we
cannot
tell
from
the
record
whether
the
hotel
is
on
the
reservation
or
off
the
reservation,
can
we?
justice
stevens
not...
no
allegation
even
one
way
or
the
other?
don't
we
just
have
the
complaint?
that's
the
whole--
justice
stevens
--yeah.
justice
stevens
but
you
don't
have
a
parallel
to
that
here,
i
don't
think?
