chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
88-266,
oklahoma
tax
commission
versus
jan
graham.
mr.
miley,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
don't
think...
if
this
court
were
to
conclude
that
the
case
had
been
improperly
removed
from
the
state
trial
court
to
the
federal
district
court,
we
wouldn't
then
get
to
the...
the
question
of
the
sovereignty,
would
we?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
the
state
court
might
have
to
make
that
decision.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
the
tribe
would
have
a
right
to
appeal
again
through
the
state
courts
and
eventually
to
this
court--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--on
that
point?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
miley.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
rabon.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
general
rule
surely
is
under
the
well
pleaded
complaint
doctrine
that
the
plaintiff
sets
forth
its
basis
for
recovery.
and
if
that
involves
only
state
law,
then
it's
not
removable.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
other
test
is
there?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
gulley
was
decided
in
1936,
and
in
cases
as
recently
as
our
caterpillar,
which
are
maybe
one
or
two
years
old,
certainly
we've
talked
and
talked
only
really
about
the
well
pleaded
complaint
doctrine.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
the...
under
the
well
pleaded
complaint
doctrine,
you
don't
decide
on
how
good
a
cause
of
action
a
complaint
states.
that's
for
the
court
in
which
the
plaintiff
sues
to
decide.
all
you
decide
under
the
well
pleaded
complaint
doctrine
is
whether
there's
something
in
the
complaint
that
shows
you
that
the
plaintiff
is
relying
on
federal
law
to
establish
his
case,
and
you...
you're...
this
just
doesn't
meet
that.
you
agree
that
if
the
well
pleaded
complaint
rule
governs
here
the
tenth
circuit
was
wrong,
don't
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
are
you
saying
that
the
state's
complaint
here
rested
on
federal
law?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
what
federal
law
is
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
what
is
the
substance
of
the
federal
law?
what
does
the
federal
law
that
you're
talking
about
say?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
mean
tell
me
just
what
the
summarize
what
the
federal
law
say
that
you're
talking
about.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
the
power
of
congress
to
legislate
in
that
area
undoubtedly
is
plenary,
but
this
doesn't
mean
that
whenever...
whenever
someone
sues
an
indian
tribe
in
the
state
court
and
simply
sets
forth
a
state
ground
of
action,
the
oklahoma
tax
law
that
says
you're
liable
for
sales
tax,
it...
it
becomes
removable
to
federal
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rabon.
mr.
miley,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
miley.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
no.
88-266,
oklahoma
tax
commission
versus
jan
graham.
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
held
that
an
action
originally
brought
by
the
oklahoma
tax
commission
against
members
of
an
indian
tribe
to
recover
state
sales
taxes
could
properly
removed
be
from
state
to
federal
court.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
concluding
that
under
our
well-pleaded
complaint
doctrine,
as
a
spouse
in
a
number
of
our
cases,
its
holding
was
an
error.
