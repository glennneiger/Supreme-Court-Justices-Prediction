let
me
ask
you,
counsel,
do
the
tribes
have
the
authority
to
waive
their
immunity
from
suit?
justice
kennedy
have
we
so
helm
or
is
there
a
case
that
establishes
that?
justice
kennedy
was
there
a
disposition
at
that
time?
yes.
justice
kennedy
well,
i
recognize
you
claim,
of
courser
they
don't
have
immunity
anyway,
but
they
claim
they
do.
justice
kennedy
but
you
also
take
a
position
that
it
can
be
waived
if
they
do
have
it?
justice
kennedy
well,
some
of
the
cases
are
ones
in
which
the
tribe
brings
suit,
and
it's
usually
a
concomitant
of
bringing
suit
that
waivers
implied
to
that
extent,
but
if
we
assume
that
tribal
immunity
can
be
waived,
then
that
issue
is
particularly
speculative
at
this
time,
and
it
would
seem
to
me
to
more
like
defense
than
an
element
of
the
complaint.
