justice
white
well,
what...
is
it
your
submission
that
connecticut's
posting
law
has
no
effect
at
all
on
the
prices
in
new
york,
for
example?
justice
white
and...
and
so,
what
was
the
purpose
of
your
posting
law?
justice
white
well,
that's
the
posting
law.
what
about
the
affirmation
law?
justice
white
what's
the
purpose
of
that?
justice
white
all
right.
and
that
has
no
effect
on
the
prices
in
new
york--
justice
white
--well,
the--
justice
white
--the
court
below
thought...
certainly
thought
it
did.
justice
white
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
say?
justice
white
what--
justice
white
--uh-hum.
justice
white
well,
that...
that...
that
means
that
it
has
an
effect
on
pricing
in
other
states.
justice
white
well,
that's
what...
that's
what
i
asked.
you
said
no.
justice
white
but
it
did
say
that
the
effect
of
your
affirmation
law...
posting
an
affirmation...
was
that
the
companies
couldn't
change
their
prices
in
other
states.
justice
white
for
all
practical
purposes,
they
couldn't
because
of
the
laws
of
the
other
states.
justice
white
and
so,
you
were
really
achieving
by
your...
by
your
new...
by
your
new
law
or
the
present
law
what
you...
you
had
the
same
effect
as
under
the
old
law,
didn't
you?
justice
white
and
do
you
think
it...
do
you
disagree
that
it
had
the
same
effect?
justice
white
and...
and
don't
you
think
the
legislature
wanted
it
to
have
the
same
effect?
justice
white
you're
trying
to
protect
your
retail
dealers,
aren't
you?
justice
white
could
i
ask
you
just...
new
york
has...
permits
volume
discounts.
justice
white
i
mean,
quantity
discounts.
justice
white
and
in
connecticut
you
cannot
give
them.
justice
white
now,
what
if
the...
what
if
the...
do
the...
do
the
brewers
selling
in
new
york
have
to...
when
they
post
under
the
new
york
law,
they
have
to
post
their
quantity
discounts?
justice
white
well,
let's
assume
there
is
a
quantity
discount
in
effect
in
new
york.
justice
white
now,
at
what
price
do
they
have
to
sell
in
connecticut?
do
they
have
to
give
every
small
wholesaler
a...
a...
the
advantage
of
a
quantity
discount
even
though
he
doesn't...
even
though
he
doesn't
buy
in
such
quantities?
justice
white
why?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but...
but--
justice
white
--well,
but
they
can't
be
giving
your...
your
people
quantity
discounts.
justice
white
don't
you
think
that
has
some
consequence
on...
on
their
pricing
and...
their
quantity
discount
pricing
in
new
york?
justice
white
but
you
do...
but...
but
if
they
want
to
give
quantity
discounts
in
new
york,
they're
going
to
have
to
sell
beer
at
that
quantity
discount
price
in
connecticut.
justice
white
even
though...
even
though
none
of
the
buyers
happen
to...
happen
to
be
buying
in
quantities
big
enough
to
justify
a
discount.
justice
white
i
know.
justice
white
i
know.
justice
white
but
you
force
the
companies
to
sell
at
that
lower
price
even
though
if
they
had
a
quantity
discount
system,
none
of
these
people
would
qualify
for
the
quantity
discount.
justice
white
well--
justice
white
--pennsylvania
comes
in
here
and
says
the
effect
it
has
on...
on
the
market
is
that
the
brewers
won't
give
us
quantity
discounts
anymore.
justice
white
well,
mr....
mr.
glekel,
if...
if...
if
new
york
didn't
have
a...
some
kind
of
a
posting
law,
if
the...
if
the...
if
a
company...
if
a
distiller
could
lower
his
prices
there
anytime
he
wanted
to,
would
the
connecticut
law
be
valid
then?
justice
white
of
course,
i
doubt...
probably
connecticut
wouldn't
have
this
statute
then
if--
justice
white
--if
it
were
so
easy
to
change
the
prices
in
other
states.
justice
white
just
wait
a
day.
justice
white
just
wait
a
day,
yes.
well,
mr.
glekel,
does
the
record
tell
us
anything
about
the
frequency
of
price
changes
in
this
industry?
