of...
of
course,
if
that's
true
and
quantity
discounts
are
irrelevant,
you
wouldn't...
you
wouldn't
need
this
statute.
justice
kennedy
but
the
problem
is
that
with
quantity
discounts
in...
in
new
york,
a
new
york
price
per
se
just
has
really
no
relation
to
the
connecticut
market
structure.
justice
kennedy
well,
i
guess
the
point
is,
as
justice
stevens'
question
illustrates,
you
say,
well,
connecticut
is
really
eliminated...
a
rigidly
controlled
market,
but
it
still
abolishes...
or
it
still
prohibits
quantity
discounts.
and
that's
one
of
the
whole
problems
in
this
case.
justice
kennedy
so,
would
you
concede
that
the
goal
is
to...
of
the...
of
the
affirmation
law
is
to
eliminate
the
price
disparity
between
connecticut
and
other
states?
justice
kennedy
counsel--
justice
kennedy
--do...
do...
do
we
have
any
case
in
which
we
say
that
market
behavior
of
a
regulated
entity
in
some
other
state
can
be
the
premise
for
legislation
in
the
home
state?
justice
kennedy
and
you
read...
you
read...
you
read
that
for
the
proposition
that
outside
market
behavior
is
a
valid
regulatory
premise
under
the
commerce
clause.
