we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
88-449,
john
healy
v.
the
beer
institute;
no.
88-513,
wine
and
spirits
wholesalers
of
connecticut
v.
the
beer
institute.
mr.
vacchelli?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
is
the...
what
is
the
basic
purpose
of
an
affirmation
law?
is
it
to
get
lower
prices
for
the
retailers
or
for
the
consumers
or
for
both?
or
is
it
some
other
purpose?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
vacchelli.
mr.
glekel?
chief
justice
rehnquist
when
you
say
purposefully
regulates,
mr.
glekel,
you
put
to
one
side,
i
take
it,
cases
in
which
a
local
law
will
have
an
effect,
although
it's
not
designed
to
have
that
effect
in
another
state.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
glekel,
supposing
that
connecticut
passed
the
converse
of
this
sort
of
a
statute
in
the
interest
of
a...
a
mild
form
of
prohibition
requiring
that
the
brewers
affirm
that
the
prices
in
the
neighboring
states
were
no
lower.
would
that
have
the
same
commerce
clause
consequences?
chief
justice
rehnquist
or
keeping
prices
in
connecticut
high.
chief
justice
rehnquist
would
that...
would
that
be
good
or
bad
under
the
commerce
clause
and
under
the
twenty-first
amendment?
chief
justice
rehnquist
even
though
it's
a
perfectly
permissible
purpose,
i
take
it,
for
connecticut
under
the
twenty-first
amendment
to
say
we
want
to...
we
don't
want
to
prohibit
beer
consumption
outright
but
we
want
to
keep
the
price
high
so
that
not
many
people
drink
very
much.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
does
that
mean
that
every
state
is
limited
to
the
least
restrictive
form
of
regulation
of
the
liquor
business
because
if
it
adopts
anything
more
restrictive
like
connecticut
does,
it's
going
to
interfere
with
neighboring
states
which
have
a
more
relaxed
regime?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you...
you
answered
earlier
in
response
to
my
hypothetical
that
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
if
we
were.
if
it
has
an
extraterritorial
effect
even
if
it
promotes
temperance,
it
fails
under
the
commerce
clause.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
my...
my
hypothesis.
chief
justice
rehnquist
even
though
it...
it
has
a
perfectly
legitimate
motive
to
promote
temperance.
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
would
it
impose
a
burden
on
consumers
and
border
states?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
why...
why
should
that
view
prevail
over
the
more
restrictive
view?
why
shouldn't
each
state
be
entitled
to
have
its
own
view?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
isn't
that
a
permissible
purpose
under
the
twenty-first
amendment?
the
state
has
complete
authority
to
regulate...
what
is
it...
the
sale
and
consumption.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
your
position
is
that
no...
no...
even
temperance
purposes
under
the
twenty-first
amendment
wouldn't...
would
not
allow
the
state
to
adopt
extraterritorial.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
glekel,
what
if
connecticut
adopted
a
state
liquor
store
policy
of
simply
saying
that
the
only
people
that
can
sell
liquor
in
connecticut
or
beer
are
liquor...
are
the
state
liquor
stores.
and
it's
a
state-owned
company,
and
the
state-owned
company
says
to
all
the
distributors
we're
not
going
to
pay
you
any
more
for
your
liquor
than
you...
than
you're
offering
for
in
new
york.
there
would
be
nothing
wrong
with
that,
would
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
certainly
lots
of
states
have
adopted
it
so
far
as
liquor
is
concerned.
chief
justice
rehnquist
then
how
is
the
state
liquor
business
supposed
go
about
purchasing
from
brewers?
to
say,
you
know,
you
just
charge
me
whatever
you
want?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
might
you
not
bargain
to
say
i
won't
pay
you
a
bit
more
than
you
charge
new
york
wholesalers?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
glekel.
mr.
vacchelli,
you
have
one
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
vacchelli.
the
case
is
submitted.
