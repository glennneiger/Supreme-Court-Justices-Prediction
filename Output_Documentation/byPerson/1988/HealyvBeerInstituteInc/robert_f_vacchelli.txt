mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
an
action
for
declaratory
judgment
and
injunction
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
connecticut's
beer
affirmation
law.
under
connecticut
law
brewers
must
post
their
prices
once
a
month
on
the
sixth
day
of
the
month,
and
at
that
time
affirm
or
swear
under
oath
that
that
price
is
no
higher
than
the
lowest
then
being
offered
in
the
surrounding
states
of
massachusetts,
new
york
or
rhode
island.
the
law...
the
price
becomes
effective
on
the
first
day
of
the
next
month
and
is
effective
all
throughout
that
next
month.
also,
under
another
provision
of
connecticut
law,
brewers
are
free
to
change
or
lower
their
prices
at
any
time
elsewhere,
and
such
a
change
or
decrease
in
price
does
not
constitute
a
violation
of
connecticut
law.
the
law
is
challenged
under
the
commerce
clause,
and
three
issues
emerge:
one,
whether
it
contains
an
impermissible
extraterritorial
thrust
and
thus
directly
regulates
commerce
in
other
states;
second,
whether
it
constitutes
protectionist
legislation
by
neutralizing
the
competitive
advantages
in
other
states;
and
third,
whether
it
is
an
indirect
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
we
submit
that
the
law
passes
muster
under
all
three
commerce
clause
tests
and
to
whatever
effect
it
has
on
interstate
commerce,
it
is
sanctioned
by
the
twenty-first
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
considering
extraterritorial
effect,
the
case
of
brown-forman
is
on
point.
in
that
case,
this
court
struck
down
new
york's
affirmation
law
because
it
prevented
brewers
from
lowering
their
prices
in
other
states
lower
than
that
which
was
in
effect
in
new
york
at
the
time.
the
court
noted
that
that
constituted
an
impermissible
extraterritorial
effect
because
it,
in
effect,
regulated
prices
in
other
states
in
violation
of
the
commerce
clause.
connecticut's
law
was
struck
down
in
1982
for
this
same
reason.
and
it
was
amended
in
1984
with
precisely
this
defect
in
mind.
today
under
connecticut
law,
brewers
are
free
to
change
their
prices
in
other
states
at
any
time,
and
that
price
change
does
not
constitute
a
violation
of
connecticut
law.
brewers,
however,
contend
that
they
do
not
have
the
pricing
flexibility
that
the
connecticut
statute
purports
to
extend.
new
york,
they
argue,
has
a
180-day
price
hold
on
price
reductions,
and
massachusetts
has
a
30-day
price
hold
on
all
prices.
the
second
circuit
agreed
and
found
that
there...
since
there
was
no
difference
between
what,
in
effect,
occurred
prior
to
the
amendment,
that
even
with
the
amendment,
the
law
still
contains
an
impermissible
extraterritorial
thrust.
we
respectfully
submit
that
it
should
be
clear
that
connecticut
has
no
control
over
the
pricing
laws
in
new
york
or
massachusetts.
connecticut
allows
brewers
to
change
their
prices
at
any
time
and
it
does
not
constitute
a
violation
of
connecticut
law.
connecticut
has
done
all
that
it
can
to
satisfy
the
statements
in
brown-forman
and
the
prohibitions
discouraged
there.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
that's
correct,
your
honor.
there
is
still
no
brewery
in
connecticut.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
yes.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
well,
the...
that
is
because
we
submit
in
connecticut
prior
to
1981,
the
connecticut
laws
were
congested
with
regulatory
provisions
that
protected
the
local
industry.
and
as
a
result,
liquor
prices
were
high
and
consumers
found
it
worthwhile
to
cross
the
state
borders
in
large
numbers.
in
1982,
the...
the...
in...
the
general
assembly
made
a
policy
change.
they
decided
they
were
no
longer
going
to
be
supporting
the
profits
of
its
local
industry
members.
it
would
attempt
to
bring
beer
prices
down
which
would
facilitate
consumers
purchasing
beer
in
connecticut
more
and
thereby
facilitate
the
collection
of
taxes.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
pardon
me?
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
well,
not
at
all.
[laughter]
the
brewers
contend
that
this
is
protectionist,
and
the
second
circuit
agreed.
and
we
submit
it's
completely
ironic
to
view
a
law
which
attempts
to
bring
prices
down
in
a
state,
which
attempts
to
make
a
local
industry
more
competitive,
to
call
that
protectionist.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
quantity
discounts
are
not
allowed
in
connecticut.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
they
are.
quantity
discounts
are
allowed
in
new
york.
whether
or
not
they
actually--
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
--well,
it's...
the
net
effect
is
that
the
price
of
beer
is
lower
in
connecticut
now,
that
it
has
worked.
and
i
think
the
statements
of
representative
zajac
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
65a
shows
that
beer
prices
are
now
lower,
and
we
don't
have
the
problem
that
we
had
in
connecticut
prior
to
1981.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
well--
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
--well,
you're...
i
think
you're
making
some
assumptions
about
the
marketplace
in
new
york
and...
and
in
connecticut.
it's
true
that
new
york
does
allow
volume
discounts,
but
there
are
other
provisions
in
new
york
law
that
are
more
restrictive
too,
such
as
the
180-day
price
hold.
if
brewers
lower
their
prices
in
new
york,
they
must
keep
that
for
six
months.
that
is
certainly
a
deterrent
to
their
ability
to
target
prices
throughout
the
state
of
new
york.
and
i
think
this
is--
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
--well,
i...
i'm
not
sure
that
the
ability
or
disability
to
give
quantity
discounts
has
much
to
do
with
the
competitiveness
of
the...
of
the
connecticut
industry
since
the
net
effect
is
that
we
do
have
lower
prices
in
connecticut
now.
and
by...
because
the--
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
--well,
lower
in
comparison
to
other
states.
prior
to
1981,
the
price
difference
was...
was
significantly
different.
in
connecticut
consumers
were
leaving
the
state
in
large
numbers
to
purchase
their
beer
elsewhere.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
no,
they're
not
lower
than
new
york
now,
but
we
don't
have--
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
--the
price
difference
that--
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
--they're...
they're
lower
in
comparison
to
new
york
as
they
used
to
be
in
1981.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
yes,
right.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
well,
the
actual
prices
are...
are
not
a
matter
of
record,
but
they
may
very
well
be
still
a
little
bit
higher
than
they
are
in
new
york.
but
the...
the
difference
between
the
prices
in
connecticut
and
the
prices
in
new
york,
massachusetts
and
rhode
island
are
not
as
significant
as
they
used
to
be.
and
i
think
that's
what
representative
zajac
was
referring
to
in
the
testimony
that
appears
in
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
that's
exactly
what
we're
saying,
your
honor.
i
think--
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
--well,
the...
the
essential
purpose
of
the
posting
law
is
so
that
regulators
know
what
price
is
in
effect
in
connecticut.
and
so,
if
prices
are...
are
sold
at
a
lower
level,
they...
they
know
who
is
violating
the
law.
it's...
it's
an
administrative
facility
to
determine--
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
--the
affirmation
law--
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
--well,
the
purpose
of
that
i
think,
as
i
was
getting
at
before,
is
that
the
general
assembly
made
a
policy
change
in
1982.
they
were
going
to
try
to
make
prices
in
connecticut
more
competitive.
and
affirmation
is
one
of
the
tools
that
enables
states
to
do
that.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
no,
your
honor,
it
doesn't.
we
had
quite
a
bit
of
litigation
over
this
in
the
first
healy
case.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
as
you
understand--
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
--i
don't
think
any
of
the
trial
courts
agreed
with
that.
in
the
first
case,
healy
i,
justice...
the
trial
court
judge
there
said
there
was
no
impact,
no
effect
on
interstate
commerce
by
this
law.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
address
that
issue
at
all.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
it...
it
let
that
stand.
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
the
healy
i
case
is
focus
on
the
mechanics
of
the
law.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
they
found
that
this...
the...
the
law
at
the
time
prevented
brewers
from
lowering
their
prices
in
other
states
because
if
they
did
that--
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
--it
does,
but
i
don't
think--
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
--i'm
trying
to
make
the
distinction
now.
it
certainly
did
prevent
them
from
changing
their
prices
in
other
states,
and
that
was
extraterritorial.
but
we
don't
read
either
the
healy
i
case
or
this
court's
decision
in
brown-forman
as
finding
that
all
laws...
all
affirmation
laws
have
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce,
that
they
are
protectionist.
i
think
both
those
cases
focused
on
the
mechanics
of
the
law
and...
and
how
they
worked
because,
as
in
the
seagram's
case,
there's
no
evidence
in
this
case
of
whether
or
not
there's
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce,
but
what
exactly
affirmation
does
to
the
markets
in
beer.
it's
quite
clear
that
beer
flows
freely
across
state
borders
into
connecticut.
and
the
brewers
have
failed
to
put
on
any
evidence
in
this
case
of
the
market
and
what
the
effect
of
this
law
has
on
the
market.
they
did
put
on
evidence
like
that
in
the
healy
i
case.
they
put
on
affidavits
from
various
officers
and
companies.
they
put
on
an
affidavit
from
their
economist
saying
the
adverse
effects
to
interstate
commerce.
in
healy
i,
the
state
put
on
its...
its
affidavits,
and
it
put
on
its
expert
witness,
its
economist.
and
there
was
a
battle
of
the...
of
the
experts
in
that
case.
and
the
net
result
was
the
trial
court
found
that
there
was
no
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
in
this
case
it's
devoid
of
any
evidence
of
what
adverse
impact
this
law
may
have
on
the
market.
and
so,
we
moved
for
summary
judgment
in
that...
on
that
issue
and
were
successful
on
that
at
least
in
the
trial
court.
but,
again,
also
in
the
second
circuit,
the
court
didn't
focus
on
what
interference
is
being
worked
in
the
market.
it
didn't
focus...
it
didn't
even
address
whether
or
not
there
was
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
the...
the
second
circuit
didn't
discuss
the
protectionism
issue.
again,
it
focused
on
the
mechanics
of
the
law
and
whether
it
has
an
extraterritorial
effect.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
well,
i
think
it--
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
--yes.
in
effect,
they--
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
--that's
exactly
what
the
court
felt,
and
i
think
that's
how
they
ruled.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
no,
i
don't
think
i
disagree
with
that
in
that
they're
not--
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
--no.
that's
absolutely
not...
what
the
legislature
wanted
to
do
was
to
make
connecticut
marketplace
more
competitive,
to
bring
prices
down.
its
purpose
wasn't
to
prevent
brewers
from
changing
their
prices
in
other
states.
and
that's
exactly
why
they
wrote
this
specific
provision
of
the
law
to
free
them
to
do
that.
that's
the
defect
they
had
in
mind.
they
addressed
it
as
plainly
and
as
squarely
as
they
possibly
could.
if
brewers
are
not
free
to
change
their
prices
in
new
york
or
massachusetts
as
freely
as
they
wish,
that
is
because
of
the
laws
in
new
york,
not
because
of
the
laws
of
connecticut.
and
this
is
not--
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
--and
we
submit
that
this
is
not
a
constitutional
deficiency
because
of
this.
all
companies
engage--
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
--well,
are
you
saying
that
it
discriminates
against
connecticut
brewers?
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
and
there's...
there
are
no
brewers,
and
they
are
also--
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
--they
must
sell
to
wholesalers.
if
they
sell
to
a
wholesaler
in
new
york,
they
must
sell
in
connecticut
at
that
same
low
price.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
xxx.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
well--
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
--well,
i
don't
think
that
constitutes
a
discrimination,
your
honor.
as
long
as
all...
if
all
brewers
are
free
to
sell
only
in
connecticut
or
if
they're
free
only
to
sell
in
new
york,
then
the
law
affects
them
all
the
same.
every
brewer
is
eligible
to...
under
that
same
kind
of
a
scenario.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
well--
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
--the...
the...
there
are
no
brewers
in
connecticut,
so
that
is
a
hypothetical--
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
--well,
how
does
it
interfere
with
interstate
commerce?
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
well,
i...
i'm
falling
to
see
the
discrimination
because
you're...
you're...
i
think
it's
talking
about
apples
and
oranges.
in
one
case,
you're
talking
about
one
company
that
only
sells
within
the
state
of
connecticut.
in
another
case,
you're
talking
about
people
that
sell
in
all
different
states.
if
you're
talking
about
discriminating
against
interstate
commerce,
it
would
be
discriminatory
for
connecticut
to
say
that
connecticut
brewers
who
engage
in
interstate
commerce
are
free
to
sell
lower
in
connecticut
as
opposed
to
interstate
brewers--
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
--who
are
not
located
in
connecticut
can
sell
elsewhere.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
well,
i'm
just
not
following.
i
don't
think
it's...
you're
talking
about
different
classes.
if
they...
if
all
are
in
the
same
class
and
if
they're
being
discriminated
against,
that
constitutes
a
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce.
you're
talking
about
different
classes
altogether.
one
class,
only
interstate...
only
within
the
state
of
connecticut...
if
they
don't
engage
in
interstate
commerce,
and
another
class
that
engages
in
interstate
commerce.
we
can't
treat
companies
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
any
differently
than
we
treat
local
companies.
but
that's
not
the
case
here.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
there
are
two
different
categories
and
two
different
classifications
in--
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
--i
think
so,
and
that's
especially
true
under
the
twenty-first
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
where
each
state...
if
i'm...
if
i'm
not
giving
an
acceptable
answer
to
you
on
that,
at
least
under
the
twenty-first
amendment--
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
--it's
certainly
valid
for
them
to
do
that--
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
--because
there
they're
just
regulating
commerce
within
the
state.
if
it's
not
going
out
the...
out
the
state,
they
can
discriminate
all
they
want.
but
i
think
the
point
i'm
trying
to
bring
out
is
that
you're
talking
about
two
different
classes
and
where
there
are
differences,
discrimination
is
permitted
as
long
as
there
are
differences
in
factual
situations.
and
you
have
completely
different
factual
situations
here.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
that's
difficult
to
answer.
the
yes...
the
answer
to
that
would
probably
be,
yes,
probably.
the
answer
would
be
this
would
be
a
valid
provision
provided
it's
not
protectionist
in
purpose
and
provided
it
doesn't
interfere
with
interstate
commerce.
but
without
testing
those
other
two
issues,
i
don't
think
i
can
answer
that...
that
question.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
connecticut
isn't
trying
to
contain
to
give
a
competitive
advantage
to
connecticut
over
new
york,
massachusetts
or
rhode
island.
it's
trying
to
make
its
own
liquor
industry
more
competitive.
it's
not
trying
to
treat
new
york
customers
differently,
and
there's
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
it
does.
just
as
in
the
seagram's
case,
the...
it's
just
as
likely
that
this
law
will
give
connecticut
lower
prices
rather
than
new
york
or
massachusetts
higher
prices,
and
there's
no
evidence
to
the
contrary.
but
i
think
when
you're...
when
you're
getting
at
the...
the...
the
heart
of
the
protectionism
issue,
the...
you
have
to
look
at
whether
or
not
you're
protecting
a
local
industry
from
competition
outside,
protecting
a
local
industry
from
interstate
competition.
connecticut
is
not
trying
to
protect
its
local
industry
from
competition.
we're
not
trying
to
make--
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
--we're
trying
to
get
the
best
prices
for
beer
for
our
consumers
that
we
can.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
that,
as
i...
that
is
also...
it's...
we're
not
trying
to
make
them
in
a
better
position
than
anyone
else.
it's...
it
is
trying
to
put
them
in
a
more
competitive
position.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
they
permit
quantity
discounts.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
there
is...
there
is
a
difference.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
i'm
not
sure
about
that.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
yes.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
well,
the...
the...
it's
yes,
but
that's...
i
don't
think
that
situation
exists.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
only
small
wholesalers
get
quantity
discounts.
i
think
it
would
just
be
the
opposite.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
we
do
get
the
lowest
price
that's
offered.
and
if
one
wholesaler
is
getting
a
quantity
discount
that
brings
the
price
down
to
a
particular
level
per
case,
then
that
is
the
price
that
connecticut
gets.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
that's
right.
connecticut
doesn't
get
the
quantity
discount.
but
if
you
take
their
price,
subtract
the
quantity
discount,
determine
what
the
case
price
is,
that's
the
case--
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
--there's
no
evidence
of
that,
your
honor.
and
that's...
that's
the
whole
heart
of
this
case.
i
think
you're
assuming
that...
that
this...
this
will
cause...
what...
what
will
happen
if
that's
the
case?
is
that
causing
them
to
raise
their
prices
in
new
york?
there's
no
evidence
of
that.
does
that
cause
a
disturbance
in
the
market
in
beer?
there's
no
evidence
in
that.
beer
flows
freely
across
the
borders
in
connecticut,
and
that
is
the
focus
of
the
commerce
clause,
looking
at
what
is
the
disturbance
in
the
market--
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
--yes.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
that's...
well,
that's
correct.
but
in...
in
connecticut
we
don't
permit
quantity
discounts--
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
--or
volume
discounts
because
all
wholesalers--
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
--must
be
treated
the
same.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
well,
it's
possible.
but
what
effect
does
that
have
on
the
market?
that's...
that
is...
if
that
is
the
case,
assuming
you...
there
is
evidence
of
that,
and
assuming
you
could
read
that
from
the
face
of
the
law,
what
is
the
effect
of
that
on
the
market?
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
there
is
no
evidence
of...
of
that.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
well,
pennsylvania
is...
is
trying
to
get
prices
lower
than
anyone
else
in
the
country,
and
that's
exactly
why
affirmation
laws
came
into
effect
in
the
first
place.
if
it
does
cause
a
disturbance
in
the
market,
it
certainly
would
have
been
apparent
by
now.
affirmation--
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
--well,
i
think
generally
they
were
enacted
for
both
purposes:
one,
to
prevent
discrimination,
geographic
price
discrimination
which
is
the
same
kind
of
theory
as
under
the
robinson
patman
act,
and
secondly,
to...
to
get
better
prices
for
their
consumers
vis-a-vis
other
states.
and
if
you
can
see
how
it
works
in
connecticut,
it
has
worked
to
solve
a
particular
social
problem
that
connecticut
was
having
with
consumers
leaving
the
states
in
large
numbers,
buying
liquor
themselves,
bring
it
into
connecticut
completely
beyond
the
control
of
connecticut
authorities.
and
this
is...
this
is
where
the
twenty-first
amendment
issue
comes
in.
under
that
amendment,
states
have
broad
powers
to
regulate
liquor
within
their
borders
according
to
their
own
philosophies.
and
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
works
an
exception
to
the
normal
operations
of
the
commerce
clause;
that
is,
if
the
law
is
not
extraterritorial...
and
to
this
point,
extraterritorial
means
preventing
brewers
from
changing
prices
in
other
states
and
making
it
illegal
for
them
to
do
that.
if
it's
not
extraterritorial
and
if
its
an
exercise
of
a
core
power
of
the
twenty-first
amendment,
then
the
law
will
outweigh
whatever
impact...
adverse
impacts
it
may
have
on
interstate
commerce.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
yes,
as
long
as
it's
not
protectionist
and
as
long
as
it
doesn't
burden
interstate
commerce.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
well,
i
think
you
have
to
see
what
it
does
to
the
marketplace
and
how
it
interferes
with
interstate
commerce.
i
don't
think
it
can--
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
--on
its
face
it's
dealing
with
two
different
categories,
two
different
classifications
of
dealers,
one
that's
only
involved
in
connecticut
and
one
that's
involved
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
yes.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
the
system
is
every
product
has
to
have
a
shipper.
the
shipper
has
to
be
licensed
in
connecticut.
that
shipper
sells
to
the
wholesaler.
the
wholesaler
sells
to
the
retailer.
so,
whether
the
origin
is...
is
canada
or
germany
or
anywhere
in
the
world...
the
origin
of
the
product...
it
still
goes
through
the
same
system.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
that's
right.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
and
considering
the
hypotheticals,
your
honor,
the
real
world
is
that
there
are
no
brewers
in
connecticut.
and
i
don't
think
the
law...
the
law...
you
have
to
test
the...
the
actual
effects
of
the
law
on
the
market.
there
is
no
adverse
effect
on
the
market
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
and
a
core
power
that
it's
being
exercised--
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
--well,
seagram's
is
the
only
one
that
comes
to
mind
immediately
in
that
we
can
regulate
with
reference
to
prices--
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
--well,
it's
not
exactly
the
same
thing,
but
it's
very
similar
in
that
states
are
free
to...
to
put
on
price
controls
on
the
sale
of
liquor
within
their
states
with
reference
to
what's
happening
in
other
states.
and
i
think
the
very
evil
that
it's
being
protected
here
is
obvious
in
connecticut,
that
if
consumers
are
able
to
leave
the
state
in
large
numbers
and
purpose...
and
purchase
their
liquor
elsewhere,
it
completely
short-circuits
connecticut's
regulatory
system.
if
we
can't...
if
connecticut
has
pervasive
regulations
regulating
what
industry
members
can
sell,
when
they
can
sell
it,
who
they
can
sell
it
to,
how
much
they
can
sell
it
for,
and
if
consumers
can
leave
the
state
and
short-circuit
that,
then
their
powers...
state
power
is
completely
short-circuited.
connecticut's
interest
in
this
case
is
plain.
it's
trying
to
make
the
connecticut
industry
more
competitive.
it's
not
trying
to
discriminate
against
industries
that
regulate...
that
operate
in
interstate
commerce.
and
unlike
the
midcal
case
and
324
liquor
case,
it's
substantiated.
the
brewers'
state
affirmation
works
in
their
brief.
the
legislative
debates
show
that
it
works,
and
we
wouldn't
be
here
if
that
wasn't
so.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
f.
vacchelli
just
one
point,
your
honor,
and
that's
on
the
matter
of
the
seagram's
case.
approximately
30
years
ago
the
court
stated
in
seagram
that
it's
permissible
for
states
to
regulate
prices
with
reference
to
prices
in
other
states,
and
that
it
would
wait
to
see
what
effect
it
would
have
on
the
market
and
take
the
matter
up
at
another
time.
we've
been
waiting
almost
30
years
and
we
still
haven't
seen
what
adverse
material
impact
affirmation
laws
have
on...
on
the
beer
markets.
and
to...
and
this
case
adds
nothing
to
that.
and
also,
with
respect
to
the
louisiana
law
review
article
cited
by
some
of
the
amici
and
the...
and
the
brewers,
we
urge
the
court
to
reject
consideration
of
that
because
this
is
economic
testimony
and
it's
impermissible
to
enter
something
like
that
in...
at
the
supreme
court.
and
it's
also
incorrect
in
footnote
47
of
that
article
the
authors
note
that
they
will
be--
