justice
stevens
well,
but
you
do
allow
for
quantity
discounts
in
connecticut?
justice
stevens
but
they
are
in
new
york,
aren't
they?
justice
stevens
how
do
you
explain
that
as
consistent
with
your
policy
in
trying
to
make
the
market
real
competitive?
justice
stevens
no,
his
point
is
they're
free
to--
justice
stevens
--his
point
is
they're
free
to
sell
higher
in
connecticut.
but
the
problem
with
that
is
i
suppose
it's
pretty
hard
to
sell
beer
at
a
much
higher
price
than
the
competitive
level,
that's
the...
that's--
justice
stevens
--oh,
i...
i
don't
think
that's
right--
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
your
statute
only
has
this
restriction
with
respect
to
prices
in
neighboring
states,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
stevens
what
happens
to
beer
that
might
be
imported
from
tennessee
of
canada
or
something
like
that?
is
that
free
of
all
restriction,
or
does
it
have
to
come
through
a
wholesaler
that's
regulated?
justice
stevens
but
then
is...
i'm
still
not
quite
clear.
is
it
subject
to
this
restraint
then
that
if
the
canadian
beer
is
sold
through
a
shipper
that's
licensed,
does...
oh,
then
they...
they
still
have
to
represent
that
it's
not
sold
at
any
lower
or
any
higher
price
than
in
new
york
or...
or...
i
see.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
do
we...
do
we
know,
for
example,
that
they
ever
reduce
the
price
in
new
york?
justice
stevens
but
that
doesn't
say
anything
about
price
changes.
it
says
there
are
a
lot
of
discounts,
but
they
may
be
permanent
discounts
that
are
frozen
and
have
been
the
same
for
the
last
30
years.
justice
stevens
well,
does
that...
that
material
in
the
record
indicate
then
that
there
have...
there
have
been
continuing
price
changes
from
time
to
time
in
new
york
despite
the
connecticut
statute?
justice
stevens
let
me
put
it
a
different
way.
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
the
connecticut
statute
has
ever
prevented
any
brewer
from
making
any
price
change
that
it
wanted
to
make?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
you
started
to
explain
earlier...
and
i
was
kind
of
curious,
and
i
don't
think
you
ever
completed
it...
how
the
connecticut
statute
might
prevent
price
changes
in
new
york.
i
really
don't
understand
how
it
could
do
that.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
he
has
got
to
hold
it
for
six
months.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
but
that's
a
consequence
of
the
new
york
statute.
that's
because
new
york
says
you
got
to
keep
it
low
for
six
months.
justice
stevens
i
really
must
confess
i'm
puzzled
about
another
aspect
that
this
example
points
up.
this
traveling
back
and
forth
across
the
state
line
suggests
that
the
same
economic
market
includes
both
sides
of
the
state
line.
and
i
would
think
under
the
robinson
patman
act,
you
probably
have
to
sell
to
your
customers
on
both
sides
of
the
state
line
at
the
same
price
anyway.
justice
stevens
well,
there's
a
federal
statute
that
says
you
can't
discriminate
between
competing
purchasers
who
are
similarly
situated.
and
if
they're
in
the
same
economic
market
and
you're
suggesting
these
people
go
across
the
state
line
to
buy
beer
in
new
york
instead
of
buying
it
in
connecticut,
presumably
you're
saying
it's
cheaper
in
new
york.
if
it's
cheaper
in
new
york,
you
must
be
discriminating
between
the
new
york
customers
and
the
connecticut
customers.
justice
stevens
and
the
statute
is
designed
to
prevent
that.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
you're
saying
the
problem
is
that
the
markup
is
higher
in
connecticut.
justice
stevens
mr.
glekel,
supposing
connecticut
passed
a
statute
saying
we
will
appoint
a
price
control
commission
and
we'll
hire
investigators
to
find
out
what
the
prices
are
in
new
york.
and
they'll
periodically
report
to
the
commission
every
month,
and
they'll
set
a
new
maximum
price.
it
will
happen
to
be
triggered
by
what
the
investigators
find
over
in
new
york.
would
that
be
constitutional?
justice
stevens
well,
the
other
factors
it
takes
into
account
are
the
prices
in
rhode
island
and
new
jersey.
justice
stevens
i
see.
[laughter]
you
can
have
price
fixing
as
long
as
you
don't
do
too
much
studying
before
you
fix
the
prices.
