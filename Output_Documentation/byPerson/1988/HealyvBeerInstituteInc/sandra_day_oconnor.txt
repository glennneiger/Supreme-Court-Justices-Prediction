justice
o'connor
--mr.
vacchelli,
if
this
case
involved
a
product
other
than
alcoholic
beverages,
would
you
think
that
a
posting
statute
would
violate
the
commerce
clause?
justice
o'connor
well,
why
isn't
it
a
protectionist
purpose
for
the...
the
state
to
try
to
obtain
a
competitive
advantage
for
its
own
consumers?
justice
o'connor
you're
trying
to
protect
your
local
consumers.
