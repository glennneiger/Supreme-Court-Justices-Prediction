scalia
lower
than
what?
you
keep
saying
we
have
lower
prices.
i
don't...
it
sounds
like
an
ad,
you
know.
justice
scalia
do
you
have
lower
prices
than
new
york
now?
is--
justice
scalia
--lower
than
what?
justice
scalia
they're
lower
than
what?
you
keep
saying
they're
lower
prices.
justice
scalia
they're
lower
than
they
used
to
be
is
all
you're
saying.
justice
scalia
they're
still
higher
than
new
york,
but...
but
lower
than
they
used
to
be.
justice
scalia
mr....
go
on.
finish
that
thought
and
i'll--
justice
scalia
--can...
can
i
ask
about...
about
the
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce
aspect
you've
just
been
talking
about
the
affecting
the
laws
of
other
states.
why...
why
doesn't
this
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce
because
it's
plain
that
on
the
face
of
this
statute
if...
if
you
are
a
brewer
that...
that
manufacturers
and
markets
only
in
connecticut...
there's
no
limit
on
what
price
you
could
set.
you
can
piece
out
the
market
throughout
connecticut
any
way
you
want.
you
can
charge
low
here,
high
there.
you're
entirely
free
to...
to
price
any
way
you
want.
but
if
you're
a
brewer
that
sells
in
connecticut
and
elsewhere,
you
suddenly
have
a
price
constraint.
you
cannot
go
lower
in
connecticut
than
you
can
go
elsewhere.
why
isn't
that
a...
and
that
only
applies
if
you're
selling
outside
of
connecticut.
you...
you
have
no
restriction
if
you're
selling
in
connecticut.
justice
scalia
it...
no.
connecticut
brewers
are
freer.
they
can...
they
can
price
their...
their
product
at
whatever
they
want
inside
connecticut.
justice
scalia
well,
there
may--
justice
scalia
--yes,
but
therefore--
justice
scalia
--therefore,
if
you're
smart,
don't
sell
in
new
york.
if
you're
smart
just
sell
in
connecticut.
then
you
can
price
throughout
connecticut
at
whatever
level
you
want.
but
as
soon
as
you
sell
in
new
york,
then
your
prices
in
connecticut
have
to
be
constricted.
now,
i
don't
see
any
response
to
that
except
that
you
happen
right
now
to
have
no...
to
have
no
brewers
in...
in...
in
connecticut,
but
i
don't
know
that
we
adjudge
the--
justice
scalia
--the
facial
discriminatory
nature
of
a...
of
a
particular
law
on
the
basis
of
whether
there
currently
are
any...
any
people
being
benefited
by
it.
justice
scalia
gee,
well...
then
there's
no
such
thing
as
discriminating
against
interstate
commerce.
so
long
as
you're...
you're
free
to
engage
in
just
intrastate
commerce,
you're
not
being
discriminated
against.
justice
scalia
that
can't
be
right.
justice
scalia
well,
there
might--
--maybe
you're
trying
to
develop
them.
maybe
you're
trying
to
develop
them.
it's
certainly...
if
you
want
to
sell
in
connecticut,
the
best
way
to
do
it
now
is
to...
is
to
manufacture
and
sell
only
there.
then...
then
you
can
price
at
whatever
you
want.
whereas,
as
soon
as
you
start
selling
outside
of
connecticut,
then...
then...
then
you
have
a
price
constraint.
justice
scalia
you're
discouraging
me
from
selling
outside
of
connecticut
because
once
i
do,
then...
then...
then
i
have
a
price
constraint
when
i
sell
within
connecticut.
whereas,
if
i
just
limit
myself
to
selling
inside
connecticut,
i
can
price
at
whatever
level
i
want.
justice
scalia
--you...
you're
telling
me
that
you
don't
violate
the
commerce
clause
so
long
as
you
treat
people
who
do
business
only
in
connecticut
differently
from
people
who
are
interstate
business
people.
justice
scalia
well--
justice
scalia
--that's--
justice
scalia
mr.
vacchelli,
would
the
following
law
be...
be
constitutional
in
your
view?
connecticut
says
anyone
who
sells
beer
only
within
connecticut
may
price
it
at
whatever
price
he
wishes.
anyone,
however,
who
sells
beer
both
within
and
outside
of
connecticut
cannot
price
it
at
any
more
than
$12
a
case.
would
that
law
be
constitutional?
justice
scalia
well,
why...
but
that's
the
point.
why
doesn't
it
burden
interstate
commerce
since
it...
since
it
comes
down
only
on
those
who...
who...
who
sell
not
just
within
connecticut,
out
across
state
lines?
justice
scalia
we
can't
say
that
facially
it
discriminates
against
interstate
commerce?
