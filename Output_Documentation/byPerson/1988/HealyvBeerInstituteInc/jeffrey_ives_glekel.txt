mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
the
appellants
concede,
connecticut's
beer
affirmation
provisions
were
enacted
by
the
connecticut
legislature
in
order
to
halt
the
practice
of
connecticut
consumers
who
live
near
the
border
areas
crossing
state
lines
to
buy
beer
in
the
bordering
states
at
the
lower
prices
which
prevailed
in
those
states.
it
is
our
position
that
the
connecticut
law
violates
the
commerce
clause
on
two
different
though
somewhat
related
grounds.
first,
the
statute
is
extraterritorial.
it's
extraterritorial
because
it
purposefully
regulates
transactions
occurring
in
other
states.
second,
in
our
view--
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
--that's
right.
i
put
aside
the
cases
where
a
state
law
designed
to
promote
some
valid
objective
does
have
some
ramifications
on
commerce
in
other
states.
it
is
our
view
that
the
law
is
also
protectionist
because
it
operates
much
in
the
manner
of
a
tariff
or
a
tax
to
deprive
out-of-state
consumers
and
wholesalers
of
the
competitive
advantages
which
they
presently
enjoy
in
the
actions
of
such
legislation.
i
should
also
add
that
it
is
our
view
that
affirmation
statutes
in
general...
that
is,
state
laws
that
tie
in-state
prices
to
out-of-state
prices...
are
generally
extraterritorial
and
protectionist.
we
believe
there
is
some
factors
that
attend...
attending
the
operation
of
the
connecticut
statute
that
make
it
particularly
objectionable
on
commerce
clause
grounds.
but
it
is
our
broader
submission
that
the
logic
of
this
court's
commerce
clause
decisions
compel
the
conclusion
that
affirmation
statutes
are
generally
unconstitutional.
i
would
like
to
first
briefly
address
the
extraterritorial
operation
of
the
connecticut
statute.
this,
of
course,
was
the
basis
for
the
second
circuit's
decision
invalidating
the
law.
i
think
it
is
useful
to
focus
for
just
a
moment
on
the
manner
in
which
the
statute
came
into
existence.
in
1983,
this
court
summarily
affirmed
the
second
circuit's
decision
which
invalidated
connecticut's
predecessor
statute
on
the
grounds
that
it
prohibited
brewers
from
selling
beer
in
a
neighboring
state
at
a
price
lower
than
the
posted
connecticut
price
during
the
month
covered
by
the
posting.
the
connecticut
legislature
then
amended
the
affirmation
requirement
to
require
that
at
the
time
of
the
posting
the
prices
at
which
beer
was
sold
in
the
bordering
states
was
no
higher
than
the
posted
connecticut
price.
it
was
still
illegal,
however,
under
the
statutory
language
for
the
brewers
to
lower
prices
in
the
bordering
states
subsequent
to
their
connecticut
posting.
now,
when
the
brewers
brought
suit
again
seeking
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief,
connecticut
apparently
recognized
that
this
statute
was
just
as
unconstitutional
as
the
one
invalidated
in
the
previous
healy
decision.
the
connecticut
liquor
commissioners
attempted
to
step
into
the
breach,
and
they
issued
a
declaratory
ruling
which
basically
states
that
despite
the
statutory
language,
under
connecticut
law
it
is
not
illegal
for
a
brewer
to
lower
its
price
in
the
bordering
states
following
its
posting
an
affirmation
in
connecticut.
now,
as
i
understand
it,
connecticut's
argument
seems
to
be
that
the
brewers
really
have
nothing
to
complain
about
because
under
connecticut
law
all
they
have
to
do
is
to
adjust
their
prices
to
neighboring
state
prices...
that
is,
to
adjust
their
connecticut
price
to
neighboring
state
price
levels...
for
the
single
day
of
the
posting.
i
think
the
problem
is,
as
mr.
vacchelli
acknowledged...
is
that
the
brewers
cannot,
in
fact,
lower
it
at
lower
bordering
state
prices
subsequent
to
their
posting
an
affirmation
in
the
bordering
states
because
connecticut
law
interacts
with
the
statutes
of
the
bordering
states
in
a
way
which
makes
this
impossible.
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
if
they
were
to
affirm
that
the
prices...
if
they
had
to
affirm
that
the
prices
in
the
bordering
states
were
no
lower,
it
would
have
commerce
clause
consequences
somewhat...
somewhat
in
reverse
since
it
would
tend
to...
it
would
have
the
effect
of
preventing
or
at
least
strongly
discouraging
higher
prices
in
the
bordering
states
if
the
brewers
intended
or
wanted
to
charge
higher
prices--
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
--or
keeping
prices
in
connecticut
high.
i
think
it's
important--
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
--well,
we
would
take
the
position
that
it
would
still
be
exporting
connecticut
price
regulations
beyond
connecticut's
borders
and
influencing
prices
in
other
states.
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
that's
a
permissible
purpose
under
the...
assuming
that
was
the
purpose.
that
is
a
permissible
purpose
under
the
twenty-first
amendment,
but
i
think
that
this
court's
precedents
establish
that
even
if
the
purpose
is
permissible,
a
state
cannot
attempt
to
achieve
that
purpose
by
protectionist
or
extraterritorial
means.
and
our
objection
would
be
to
the
means.
it
would
be
somewhat
similar
to
this...
to
the
bacchus
imports
case
where
the
court
ruled
that
a
tax
which
hawaii...
a
tax
exemption
which
hawaii
granted
just
to
home-grown
liquor
and
not
to
other
liquor
was
unconstitutional.
i
think
the...
the
problem
with
that
is
that
there
are
plenty
of
things
that
connecticut
can
do
in
order
to
promote
temperance.
obviously,
they
could
prohibit
the
sale
of
beer
altogether.
they
can
certainly
regulate
the
price
of
beer.
if
they
want
to,
they
can
do
as
they
do,
make
it
illegal
to
promote
beer
or
to
discount
the
prices
of
beer.
but
they...
under
this
court's
decisions
in
bacchus
imports
and
brown-forman
and
midcal,
they
cannot
undertake
measures
which
essentially
export
the
problem
and
make
ocher
states
bear
the
burden.
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
assuming
that
all...
that
prices
could
be
lowered
in
any
of
the
bordering
states
anytime
the
brewer
wanted
to,
our
view
is
that
the
law
could
still
be
unconstitutional.
first
of
all,
obviously
for
the
moment
in
time
of
the
connecticut
affirmation,
it
does...
it
would
compel
brewers
to
adjust
their
prices
in
connecticut
and
in
the
adjoining
states
to
an
equal
level.
so,
there
would
be
some
cost
involved.
and
i
think
all
that
would
effect
would
be
the
degree
of
the
extraterritorial
impact.
if
the...
your
question
is
directed
at
the
type
of
statute--
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
--well,
i
just--
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
--i
was
just
going
to
add
that
connecticut's
statute
would
scarcely
achieve
the
purpose
it
was
designed
to
achieve,
which
mr.
vacchelli
believes
that
it
was
achieving,
if
in
fact
consumers
had
an
incentive
to
travel
from
connecticut
across
state
lines--
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
--every
day
but
one.
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
what
the...
what
the
record--
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
--yes.
yes
your
honor.
the
record
presented
in
the
context
of
the
summary
judgment
motions...
the
undisputed
facts...
i'm
referring
particularly
to
page
154a
of
the
joint
appendix...
states
among
other
things
that
new
york
and
rhode
island
brewers
and
importers,
unfettered
by
extensive
regulation,
can
and
do
offer
a
range
of
price
discounts
to
wholesalers
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
discounts
are
offered
for
quantity
sales,
sales
to
special
customers,
the
so-called
home
distributors
in
new
york,
to
encourage
advertising
by
wholesalers
for
purposes
of
test
marketing
new
products,
and
for
promotional
purposes.
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
well,
i
think
there
are
also
statements
in
the
record
that
there
is
a...
that
the
new
york
markets
are
significantly
more
competitive...
new
york
and
massachusetts,
rhode
island
markets.
there's
extensive
competition,
more
than
in
the
connecticut
market,
and
that
the
new
york
market
is
characterized
by
substantial
price
flexibility
and
variability.
i
think
you
have
to
keep
in
mined
that
in
new
york,
unlike
connecticut,
prices
are
not
uniform.
there's
no
requirement
that
prices
be
uniform
throughout
the
state.
in
connecticut,
a
brewer
has
to
have
one
statewide
price.
in
new
york,
a
brewer
can
charge
different
prices
to
different
wholesalers
in
different
areas,
and
they
do
that.
so,
it's
a
very
different,
certainly
a
far
more
competitive
market
than
you
find
in
connecticut
that
has
chosen
a
very
different
system
of...
of
regulation.
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
well,
the
record--
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
--the
present...
the...
the
present
statute.
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
no,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
as
to
what
has
occurred
since
the
actual
enactment
of
the...
of
the
connecticut
affirmation
statute.
our--
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
--well,
under
the
new
york...
new
york
does
not
have
an
affirmation
requirement--
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
--unlike
connecticut.
but
new
york
does
have
a
requirement
that
if
a
brewer
lowered
prices
in
new
york,
which
is
referred
to
as
a
price
promotion--
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
--that
price
promotion
has
to
stay
in
effect
for
a...
six
months
or
a
hundred...
or
180
days.
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
it
can
be
offered
to
a
particular
wholesaler
or
a
particular
region,
but
it
has
to
remain
in
effect.
so,
when
a
brewer
makes
the
decision
whether
to
undertake
a
price
promotion
in
new
york,
the
brewer,
one,
has
to
keep
in
mind
that
that
special
promotion
price
that
may
be
offered
to
one
wholesaler
because
wholesale
is
a
very
competitive
market,
has
to
be
offered
throughout
connecticut
for
the
six
months...
i
guess
the
six
months
plus
an
additional
month.
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
plus
the
fact
that
brewer,
after
posting
the
price
required
by
the
connecticut
affirmation
statute
following
the
beginning
of
the
promotion,
can't
just
reassess
the
situation
and
say,
gee,
this
doesn't
make
any
economic
sense.
if
we
have
to
offer
the
same
low
price
in
connecticut,
let's
halt
the
promotion
and
raise
our
prices
in
new
york
the
day
after.
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
i
don't
believe
so
because
it
is
really
only
the
connecticut
statute,
not
the
statutes
of
new
york
or
massachusetts
or
rhode
island,
that
deliberately
crosses
state
lines
by
referencing
in-state
prices
and
practices
to
out-of-state
practices
and
prices.
if
connecticut
had
nothing
more
but
the
type
of
regulations
found
in
rhode
island,
massachusetts
and...
and
new
york,
there
would
be
no
extraterritorial
problem.
the
regulations
of
the
neighboring
states
don't
cross
borders.
the
connecticut...
the
connecticut
regulations
do.
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
no,
it
doesn't
mean
that,
but
i
think
it
does
mean
if
a
state
undertakes
or
enacts
a
statute
that
is
designed
to
give
a
benefit
to
in-state
businesses
at
the
expense
of
out-of-state
businesses
and
does
this
with
the
intent
and
effect
of
imposing
a
burden
on
out-of-state
businesses,
that
violates
the
commerce
clause
despite
the
twenty-first
amendment.
the
twenty-first
amendment,
as
the
court
concluded
in
brown-forman,
does
not
authorize
extraterritorial
legislation
and
does
not
authorize
protectionist
legislation.
we're
not,
again,
talking
about
a
statute
that
promotes
some
objective
related
to
the
twenty-first
amendment
such
as
temperance,
but--
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
--not
any
extraterritorial--
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
--yes,
yes.
we
would
take
the
position
that
that...
that
that
would
still
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
yes,
because
it
was
promoting
the
temperance
through...
through
protectionist
means
and,
in
effect,
was
attempting
to
pose
a
burden
on
the
brewers
and
consumers
and
businesses
in
the
bordering
states
in
order
to
achieve
the
goals
that
it
was
seeking
on
behalf
of
the
affirmation
state.
one
of
the--
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
--because
it
might
well
interfere
with
the
policies
of
the
border
states
under
the
twenty-first
amendment
who
may
take
a
very
different
view
of
what
is
desirable.
maybe
the
bordering
states
desire
lower
prices.
maybe
they
desire
a
great
deal
of
competition,
believe
in
flexible
pricing
and
want
different
brewers
to
charge
different
prices
in
different
areas.
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
because
at
some
point
if
a
state
enacts
legislation
to
further
its
view
that
references
out-of-state
practices
as
the
measure
of
what's
permitted
in
state.
it's
going
to
interfere
with
what
other
states
want
to
do.
in
effect,
connecticut
under
the
present
statute
is
interfering
with
what
new
york,
massachusetts
and
rhode
island
would
like
to
do
in
effect.
new
york
is
telling
massachusetts
and
new
york
that
if
they
want
to
minimize
the
impact
of
the
connecticut
statute,
they
have
to
abandon
their
regulatory
practices
such
as
insisting
that
discounts
remain
in
effect
for
180
days
or
massachusetts'
30-day
rule
that
prices
have
to
remain
in
effect
for
30
days,
but
they
have
to
abandon
these
practices
or
significantly
modify
them
even
though
what
new
york
and
massachusetts
do
does
not
reach
across
state
lines
and
is
not
in
any
way
objectionable.
so,
our
view
is
that
what
connecticut
has
done
is
interfere
with
the
twenty-first
amendment
prerogatives
of
other
states
rather
than
furthering
its
own
twenty-first
amendment
policies.
i
would
say
also
there's
something
a
little
bit,
i
think,
ironic
in
connecticut
invoking
the
twenty-first
amendment
on
behalf
of
legislation
which
is
not
designed
to
promote
temperance
or
combat
any
evil
attendant
to
the
distribution
or
consumption
of
alcoholic
beverages,
but
rather
is
designed,
as
connecticut
has
in
effect
conceded,
to
divert
business
from
the
bordering
states
to
connecticut.
indeed,
what
connecticut
states
is
that
the
purpose
of
this
law
is
to
promote
the
sales
of
beer
in
connecticut.
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
it
may
be
a
permissible
purpose,
but
it's
not
a
purpose
that
under
the
twenty-first
amendment
would
enable
a
state
to
adopt
extraterritorial
or...
or
protectionist
legislation.
i--
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
--that...
that
is
our
position,
and
i...
i
think
brown-forman
supports
that
position.
i'm
just
pointing
out
that
there's
certainly
a
plus
factor
as
far
as
this
connecticut
statute
is
concerned.
i...
i
think
the
way
bacchus
imports
put
it
is
really
appropriate
to
this
connecticut
statute
as
far
as
the
twenty-first
amendment
issue
is
concerned,
and
what
the
court
concluded
there
is
that
the
amendment
simply
does
not
empower
states
to
favor
local
industries
by
erecting
barriers
to
competition,
which
is...
was
really
precisely
what
connecticut
has...
has
done
here.
i'd
like
to...
to
also
add
that
the
connecticut
affirmation
provisions
also
constitute
a
classical
example
of
an
explicitly
protectionist
statute.
and
what
the
law
really
does
on
its
very
face
is
to
strip
new
york,
massachusetts
and
rhode
island
brewers,
consumers,
retailers
of
all
the
competitive
advantages
they
would
otherwise
enjoy.
i
mean,
one
thing
is
certain.
this
legislation
will
remove
the
incentive
for
connecticut
residents
to
purchase
out-of-state
beer
and
eliminate
the
widespread
shopping
of
connecticut
residents
for
beer
in
the
neighboring
states.
it's
going
to
operate
very
much
like
a
tariff.
and
i'd
like
to
respond
here
to
one
point
that
mr.
vacchelli
made
in
response
to
a
question.
mr.
vacchelli
said
that
actually
the
price
disparity
between
connecticut
and
the
bordering
states
is
not
as
great
as
it
used
to
be,
and
he
referred
to
the
remarks
of
a
connecticut
legislator.
actually
the
connecticut
legislator
he
was
quoting...
his
remarks
are
reproduced
at
page
65a
of
the
appendix...
was
speaking
concerning
connecticut's...
when
connecticut's
current
affirmation
law
was
proposed
following
this
court's
invalidation
of
the
predecessor
statute.
and
he
was
speaking
in
support
of
the
statute
pointing
out
that
connecticut
ought
to
pass
a
new
statute
because,
in
fact,
the
prior
statute
had
worked
and
connecticut
residents
were
not
traveling
across
state
borders
like
they
used
to
to
purchase
beer.
so,
i
think
what
mr.
vacchelli
is
referring
to
really
supports
the
obvious
protectionist
nature
of
the
connecticut...
of
the
connecticut
affirmation
provisions.
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
the...
i
think
what
you're
suggesting
is
that
under
the
supremacy--
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
--no.
there's--
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
--i...
i
think
as
the
record
below
indicates,
the
connecticut
brewers...
the
brewers
basically
sell
beer
in
the
new
york
and
connecticut
markets
based
upon
competitive
provisions.
they're
very
different
regulations
in
new
york,
connecticut
and
massachusetts
and
rhode
island,
very
different
degrees
of
competition.
of
course,
new
york
brewers,
wherever
they
may
be,
sell
to
new
york
wholesalers,
and
they
sell
to
connecticut
wholesalers.
the
wholesalers,
in
turn...
a
new
york
wholesaler
cannot
sell
to
a
connecticut
retailer.
it
can
only
sell
to
a
new
york
retailer.
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
a
connecticut
wholesaler
to
a
connecticut
retailer.
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
well,
what
we
are
suggesting,
part
of
the
problem
is
undoubtedly
that
the
markup
is
higher
in...
in
connecticut.
part
of
the
problem
is
that
there's
less
competition
in
connecticut
because
of
its
increased
regulations.
so,
in
some
cases,
beer
prices
are
higher
to
connecticut
wholesalers
just
as
in
some
cases
prices
are
lower
to
connecticut
wholesalers.
what
the
record
indicates...
the
stipulated
facts...
is
that
on
the
wholesale
level,
from
brewer
to
wholesaler,
prices
in
connecticut
are
neither
the
highest
nor
the
lowest
in
the
four-state
area.
and
this
is
something
that
constantly
changes
particularly
because
of
a
lack
of
restrictions
in
the
new
york
market
where
different
wholesalers
receive
different
prices
at
different
times.
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
there
may
very
well
be.
there
is
no
state
that
has
adopted
that
policy
as
far
as
liquor...
as
far
as
beer
is
concerned.
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
they
certainly
have,
and
i
recognize
that
some
of
this
court...
this
court's
decisions
have
held
that
when
a
state
acts
in
a
proprietary
capacity
of
this
sort,
commerce
clause
restraints
don't
necessarily
apply.
however,
i
don't
think
those
precedents
would
necessarily
support
a
state
basically
selling...
taking
over
the
liquor
business
inside
a
state
and,
in
effect,
doing
the
same
thing
that
connecticut
presently
compels
under
affirmation.
i
don't
think
we're
required
to
take
any
ultimate
position
on
this,
but
i
don't
think
this
court's
precedents
necessarily
support
a
state
doing
this.
and
i
think
it's
open
to
serious
question
as
to
whether
a
state
can...
can
do
that.
i
think
that
takes
the
state
propriety
doctrine
one
step
further
than--
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
--well,
what
pennsylvania
suggested
in
its
amicus
brief,
that
brewers
should
probably...
that
the
state
should
bargain
with
the
brewers
or
distillers,
whatever,
just
like
any
other
customer
would.
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
i
suppose
there's
always
the
question
of
fact.
at
some
point...
whether
by
bargaining
in
this
nature
at
some
point
you're
doing
the
exact,
same
thing
as
you're
doing
in
affirmation.
i
think
if
a
state
had
a
hard
and
fast
policy
that,
in
fact,
made
a
brewer
sign
an
affirmation
that
it
would
never
offer
prices
any...
to
a
state
any
higher
than
those
sold
anywhere
else,
there
would
be
substantial
question
whether
that
would
be
immunized
from
commerce
clause
challenge
because
it
was
the
state
doing
it
itself
rather
than
compelling
private
parties...
private
parties
to
do
it.
i
would
like
to
turn
briefly
to
our
contention
that
affirmation
statutes
are
generally
unconstitutional
and
that
seagram
should
be
overruled
or
at
least
substantially
qualified.
we
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
principal
distinction
between
prospective,
contemporaneous
and
retrospective
affirmation
statutes.
in
our
view,
all
type
of
affirmation
laws
are
protectionist
and
exercise
impermissible
extraterritorial
control
because
what
they
do
is
to
force
brewers
to
consider
the
affirmation
state's
market
conditions
when
they
are
setting
prices
in
other
states
on
the
basis
of
market
conditions
in
those
states.
in
short,
any
law
that
compels
brewers
to
sell
their
product
in
an
affirmation
state
at
prices
no
higher
than
those
offered
in
other
states,
inevitably
is
going
to
deprive
brewers
and
consumers
and
retailers
of
the
relative
advantages
that
they
would
enjoy
without
such
legislation.
now,
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
we
are
not
contesting
the
right
of
a
state,
connecticut
or
any
other
state,
to
set
maximum
prices
for
liquor,
beer
or
any
other
commodity
if
it
feels
that's
a
wise
sort
of
policy.
what
we
believe
a
state
may
not
do,
however,
is
in
order
to
achieve
lower
prices
within
its
border,
to
impose
burdens
on
businesses
and
consumers
in
other
states.
and
this
is
what
affirmation
statutes
of
any
kind
really
do
because
under
affirmation,
a
brewer
is
no
longer
free
to
set
prices
in
out-of-state
markets
on
the
basis
of
conditions
prevailing
in
those
markets
in
order
to
maximize
their
profits.
what
the
brewer
is
compelled
to
do
is
to
consider
that
the
lowest
price
it
charges
in
out-of-state
markets
must
be
offered
throughout
the
affirmation
state.
and
i
think
the
inevitable
result
will
be
that
a
brewer
or
distiller
will
to
some
extent
modify
their
out-of-state
prices
that
they
would
otherwise
charge
in
order
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
affirmation.
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
i
think
there's...
there
always
can
be
a
question
of
fact
whether
a
state
is
doing
indirectly
what's...
what
is...
what
is
directly
prohibited.
i
suppose
if
it
considered
new
york
prices
as
one
factor
and
took
into
account
a
lot
of
other
factors--
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
--that
sounds
like
it's
unconstitutional
to
me.
mr.
jeffrey
ives
glekel
as
long
as
they're
really
not
designed
to
deprive
consumers
and
brewers
in
other
states
of...
of
their
competitive
advantages.
i'd
just
like
to
close
by...
by
noting
that
the
problem
really
with
affirmation
is
that
the
affirmation
state
is
projecting
itself
into
other
states
and
regulating
prices
in
those
states.
and
i
think
the...
the
way
this
court
put
it
in
baldwin
v.
selig
is
perfectly
appropriate
to
affirmation
statutes.
what
the
court
stated
is
that
the
commerce
clause
does
not
permit
a
state
to
establish
a
scale
of
prices
for
use
in
other
states.
i
think
this
is
the
problem
with
affirmation,
and
it's
the
primary
reason
why
affirmation
is
unconstitutional.
if
there
are
any
other
questions,
i
would
be
glad
to
answer
them.
otherwise
i'd
like
to
thank
the
court
for
its
attention.
