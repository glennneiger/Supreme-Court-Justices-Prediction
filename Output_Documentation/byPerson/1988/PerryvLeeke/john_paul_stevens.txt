justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
mr.
fairey,
you
don't
really
mean
that
last,
that
during
the
course
of
the
direct
examination,
or
the
cross
examination,
i
suppose
he
could
deny
the
lawyer
access
to
the
client.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
are
some
points
when
he
can
interfere
with
communication
between
an
attorney
and
a
client.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
supposing
at
the
end
of
the
direct
examination
the
judge
called
the
lawyers
to
the
bench
and
said
i'm
considering
a
brief
recess
to
let
people
get
a
drink
of
water,
or
something
like
that,
but
i
don't
want
to
do
it
if
you
think
you
want
to
confer
with
your
client
because
i
think
he
should
finish
his
testimony
without
consulting
with
his
lawyer.
could
the
lawyer
say,
well,
you...
would
he
have
a
right
to
insist
on
the
recess?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
the
motive
to
prevent
the
communication
that
cannot
take
place
while
the
witness
is
on
the
stand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
he
says
the
only
way
i
can
do
it
is
to
keep
him
on
the
stand,
you
would
say
he
cannot
keep
the
witness
on
the
stand?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
just
normal
reassurance
of
clients
to
tell
them
to
be
sure
and
answer
all
the
questions
carefully,
listen
and
tell
the
truth,
that
kind
of
statement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
all
he...
there's
nothing
improper,
but
he
thinks
that
the
witness
should
finish
his
testimony
before...
without
interruption.
do
you
think
that's
improper?
justice
john
paul
stevens
prior
to
geders,
don't
you
think
that
was
quite
frequently
the
practice
of
trial
judges?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
geders
represented
a
marked
change
in
the
law,
in
the
words.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
true
even
if
you
prevent
him
from
whispering
in
his
ear.
justice
john
paul
stevens
question
by
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
trial
judge
in
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--says
i
think
justice
is
better
served,
truth
is
better
found
if
we
have
the
cross
examination.
right
now,
no
consultation.
that's
the
hypothetical.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you...
and
i
understood
your
answer
to
be
that
that
is
always
improper
on
the
part
of
the
judge.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
when
is
it
proper
and
when
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
you're
avoiding
the
hypothetical.
the
hypothetical
is
that
the
district
judge
wants
to
have
the
examination
proceed
because
he
thinks
it's
a
better
test
of
the
defendant's
credibility.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
fairey,
let
me
interrupt
to
say,
because
i'd
like
you
before
you
finish
to
comment
on
your
opponent's
argument
that
during
a
recess
of
this
kind,
if
the
defendant
has
to
be
placed
in
a
cell
for
15
or
20
minutes
while
the
prosecutor
is
getting
organized
for
cross
examination,
there's
a
little
unfairness
there,
and
my
particular
question
now
is
supposing
instead
of
giving
what
you
say
is
good
testimony
on
cross
examination,
he
knew
what
he
was
doing,
say
he
had
stammered
and
indicated
that
he
was
really
emotionally
upset
and
one
thing
or
another,
but
yet
there's
all
the
evidence
of
guilt
in
the
world,
as
you're
going
to
say,
what
result
in
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
the
only
issue
i'm
directing
this
to
is
would
there
be
prejudice
if
in
reading
the
transcript
you
thought
it
may
well
be
this
man
got
quite
upset
by
being
isolated
for
15
or
20
minutes,
i
can't
really
tell,
but
what
do
you
do?
do
you
just
look
at
the
evidence
of
guilt,
or
do
you
look
at
whether
you
think
may
be
his
testimony
was
somewhat
less
persuasive
because
of
the
way
things
developed?
what
is
the
test
of
prejudice
under
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
you
wouldn't
contend,
i
assume,
that
you
could
put
the
man,
take
a
recess,
and
let
him
sit
by
himself
in
a
cell
for
an
hour
before
cross
examination
because
that
might
make
cross
examination
more
effective.
i
don't
think
you'd
take
that
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
your
understanding
of
what
happened
to
him
during
the
recess?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
how
many
people
were
in
the
holding
cell?
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
the
conclusion
of
petitioner’s
direct
testimony
in
his
criminal
trial,
the
judge
declared
a
15-minute
recess
and
ordered
the
petitioner
not
be
allowed
to
talk
to
anyone
including
his
lawyer
during
the
break.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
held
that
this
order
violated
petitioner’s
sixth
amendment
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel,
but
it
also
held
that
the
conviction
should
stand
because
the
order
did
not
prejudice
the
petitioner.
we
disagree
with
the
fourth
circuit’s
prejudice
analysis.
if
a
criminal
defendant’s
sixth
amendment
right
to
assistance
of
counsel
has
been
violated
because
of
a
denial
of
access
to
counsel,
then
a
conviction
must
be
reversed
without
consideration
of
prejudice.
however,
we
also
hold
that
in
this
case,
the
denial
of
access
to
counsel
during
the
15-minute
recess
before
cross-examination
did
not
violate
the
sixth
amendment.
accordingly,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part;
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
is
joined
by
justice
brennan
and
justice
blackmun.
