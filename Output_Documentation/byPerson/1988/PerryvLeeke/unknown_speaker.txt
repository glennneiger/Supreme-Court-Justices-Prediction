mr.
fairey,
you
wouldn't
go
so
far
as
to
give
the,
give
them
a
right
to
interrupt
the
testimony
to
say,
by
counsel,
and
say
that
i
want
to
speak
to
my
client
and
advise
him?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
sequestration
rule
are
you
referring
to?
unknown
speaker
but
i
don't
think
any
court
applied
the
sequestration
rule
prior
to
geders
to
the
defendant,
though.
unknown
speaker
you
are
telling
the
chief
justice
that
the
trial
judge
may
never
prevent
consultation
if
the
purpose
of
the
trial
judge
in
doing
so
is
to
make
it
more
difficult
and
more
strenuous
and
more
productive
for
the
cross
examination
to
proceed
without
that
advice.
unknown
speaker
what
was
it
that
the
lawyer
wanted
to
talk
to
the
client
about?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
that?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
xxx
on
whether
there
was
error.
unknown
speaker
and
the
only
issue
you
brought
up
here
is
whether
you
have
to
prove
prejudice.
unknown
speaker
well,
so
far
i
suppose
the
opposition
can
argue
there
wasn't
any
sixth
amendment
violation
at
all.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
xxx
are
you
happy
with
the
court
of
appeals'
judgement
below?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
this.
