mr.
donald
j.
zelenka
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it's
the
position
of
the
state
of
south
carolina
that
prejudice
must
be
a
consideration
in
determining
whether
a
new
trial
should
be
granted
based
upon
alleged
constitutional
error.
mr.
donald
j.
zelenka
that
is
generally
the
position
because
we
see
the
sixth
amendment
as
being
whether
he
was
denied
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel
at
this
trial.
mr.
donald
j.
zelenka
from
our
reading,
they
looked
at
the
sixth
amendment
and
said
the
sixth
amendment
essentially
is
to
determine
whether
there
is
a
fundamentally
fair
trial
where
the
true
adversarial
testing
had
occurred.
one
of
those
prongs
essentially
was
was
there
a
denial
of
access
to
counsel.
concededly,
there
was
a
denial
of
access
to
counsel
during
this
15
minute
break.
the
court
then
looked
at
the
entire
record--
mr.
donald
j.
zelenka
--we
submit
that
that
did
not
act
as
a
situation
where
he
was
deprived
of
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel
at
his
trial
because
generally
you
do
not
have
a
constitutional
right
to
consult
between
direct
and
cross
examination.
and
based
upon
that
fundamental
position
that
we
assert,
clearly,
then,
there
could
be
no
prejudice
by
a
clear
review
of
the
record
in
this
particular
case.
the
situation,
the
existence
of
prejudice
he
asserts
should
be
based
on
a
per
se
prejudicial
standard.
however,
we
submit
that
especially
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding,
where
this
court's
limited
jurisdiction
is
to
review
whether
there
was
fundamental
fairness
in
the
state
judgment,
that
prejudice,
per
se
prejudice
should
be
a
situation
when
it
is
only
likely
that--
mr.
donald
j.
zelenka
--it
turns
on,
we
submit
it
turns
on
fundamental
fairness
when
you
look
at
strickland
v.
washington
where
the
concern
was
whether
in
that
situation
prejudice
had
been
shown,
whether
the
reliability
in
the
verdict
and
the
decision
of
the
court
by
the
guarantee
of
the
right
to
counsel
had
been
undermined
by
something
that
occurred
within
the
trial.
that
is,
that
hook
into
the
sixth
amendment
is
essentially
our
position
in
this
case,
and
since
the
prejudice
or
the
possibility
of
prejudice
in
this
case
was
so
remote
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
it's
clear
that
a
per
se
rule
should
not
be
applicable.
mr.
donald
j.
zelenka
if
that
was--
mr.
donald
j.
zelenka
--no,
we
don't
take
that
position
because
of
what--
mr.
donald
j.
zelenka
--in
geders
v.
united
states,
that
was
a
situation
involving
the
overnight
recess,
and
this
court
looked
at
that
situation
and
said
that
that
is
a
time
they
normally
confer
to
talk
about
the
strategies
of
the
day,
what
occurred
during
the
trial,
and
to
prepare
for
the
next
day
and
the
succeeding
days
in
the
particular
trial.
if
we're
looking
at
a
brief
recess
during
the
days,
a
nonroutine
recess,
where
counsel,
we
submit,
had
no
expectation
that
there
would
be
such
a
recess,
no
expectation
after
he
placed
him
on
the
witness
stand
that
he
would
have
the
right
or
the
opportunity
to
discuss
the
testimony,
to
discuss
further
his
right
to
cross
examination,
under
those
circumstances
we
submit
that
the
sixth
amendment
clearly
did
not
raise
itself
because
the
right
to
counsel
under
those
situations
was
a
right
for
mr.
perry
to
meet
with
his
counsel
and
make
as
informed
decision
as
to
whether
in
fact
he
was
going
to
take
the
witness
stand.
the
right
to
counsel
under
these
circumstances
was
counsel's
right
to
interject
and
object,
should
the
solicitor's
questions
be
improper,
and
the
right
to
counsel
would
also
be
based...
the
right
based
upon
those
determinations,
whether
he
wanted
to
ask
redirect
questions
to
clear
up
any
misconceptions
that
might
have
occurred
during
that
particular
trial.
mr.
donald
j.
zelenka
that
is,
my
experience
is
it
does
not
always
occur,
and
it
certainly
does
not
always
occur
when
a
defendant
is
on
the
witness
stand.
mr.
donald
j.
zelenka
i
think
you
might
have
an
expectation
for
a
lunch
recess,
but
i
don't
think
you
would
have
an
expectation
generally
of
there
being
the,
what
we'll
call
the
routine
brief
recess
in
the
afternoon
of
the
trial
or
in
the
morning
of
the
trial.
in
this
case
there
were,
admittedly,
numerous
recesses.
there
was
a
recess,
in
fact,
during
the
direct
examination
of
mr.
perry
when
the
access
to
his
client
was
not
restricted.
there
was
also
the
luncheon
recess
that
occurred
just
prior
to
mr.
perry
taking
the
witness
stand,
and
at
the
conclusion
of
his
testimony
became
the
overnight
recess,
that
he
had
the
opportunity
to
consult,
and
he
he
did
not
chose
to
present
mr.
perry
once
again
for
examination
before
the
court
if
he
had
an
adequate
showing
or
an
adequate
need
to
do
so.
we
submit
that
since
prejudice
in
this
case
was
utterly
remote
based
upon
the
facts
of
this
case,
this
court
should
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
its
conclusions
that
there
have
been
no
showing
of
prejudice;
there
was
no
reason
to
believe,
based
upon
this
record,
that
any
communication
which
might
have
occurred
during
the
brief
recess
at
issue
could
have
altered
mr.
perry's
performance
on
cross
examination.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial,
after
the
verdict
was
entered,
a
proffer
was
made
through
the
court
by
mr.
perry
that
the
matters
they
wanted
to
discuss
with
him
during
that
brief
recess
was
his
rights
on
cross
examination.
there
was
no
contention,
and
there
was
no
contention
here
that
he
had
failed
to
previously
explain
those
rights
to
cross
examination
to
him.
it's
clear
from
a
review
of
this
particular
cross
examination
that
mr.
perry
had
took
full
advantage
of
that
cross
and
had
placed
his
story
and
his
version
of
the
events
before
the
jury.
unlike
the
childlike
position
that
he
is
seeking
to
present
before
this
court,
mr.
perry
certainly
was
not
a
passive
witness.
he
was
able
to
resist
efforts
by
the
solicitor
to
color
his
story
as
it
was
presented
about
certain
versions
of
where
he
was,
and
he
was
able
to
tell
his
own
version
of
the
particular
events
in
this
case.
he
denied
going
to
the
victim's
apartment
complex
when
that
issue
was
raised
about
the
location
of
the
automobile
and
where
her
apartment
complex
was.
he
denied
even
knowing
where
that
complex
was,
and
essentially
stated
he
had
never
been
there
in
his
life.
he
corrected
the
prosecution
about
who
had
possession
of
the
particular
gun.
he
was
able
to
answer
cogently
and
directly
to
those
questions
by
the
solicitor
rather
than
a
yes/no
question
to
those
very
strong
and
serious
questions.
and
he
was
able,
clearly,
from
a
review
of
the
record,
to
fully
explain
his
answers
on
cross
examination.
the
evidence
of
guilt
in
this
case
certainly
was
overwhelming
if
you
look
at
the
entire
record.
there
was
forensic
evidence
that
included
tire
tracks
from
his
own
automobile,
fingerprints
on
her
car
were
found.
a
footprint
of
his
was
found
on
the
scene
of
mrs.
heimberger's
death.
mr.
donald
j.
zelenka
i
don't
think
it
would
be
a
constitutional
situation.
i
think
it
would
be
a
situation
as
to
whether
the
judge
had
abused
his
discretion.
mr.
donald
j.
zelenka
i
think
the
test
would
be
to
review
the
record
as
a
whole
overall.
mr.
donald
j.
zelenka
the
assertion
that
he
presented
was
that
mr.
perry
was
not
adequately
advised
essentially
of
his
rights
on
cross
examination,
so
certainly
the
cross
examination
would
be
the
initial
place
you
would
need
to
look
on
those
situations,
and
if
there
was
a
situation
where
he
was
not
able
to
answer
the
questions
and
counsel
had
asserted
an
objection,
requesting
him,
or
the
court,
to
allow
for
there
to
be
a
further
recess
or
further
information
given
to
allow
the
defendant
to
essentially
catch
his
breath
and
develop
more
responsive
answers
to
the
question,
i
think
that
might
be
a
situation
[inaudible]
than
it
would
be
prejudice.
mr.
donald
j.
zelenka
that
might
be
a
situation
that
could
be
reviewed
under
a
strickland
v.
washington
determination
as
to
whether
that
is
something
that
reasonable
counsel
would
have
done
under
those
circumstances,
but
again,
we
would
submit
that
the
right
to
cross
examination
is
certainly
the
right
to
ferret
out
the
truth
under
the
circumstances,
and
rigorous
cross
examination
is
something
that
our
system
of
justice
relies
upon
to
allow
that
determination
to
be
made
by
the
jury.
mr.
donald
j.
zelenka
no,
i
don't,
i
don't
assert
that
or
contend
that,
and
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
record
does
not
reveal
that
he
was
placed
in
the
type
of
cell
situation
that
mr.
fairey
described.
mr.
donald
j.
zelenka
my
understanding
is
that
he
did
go
back
to
a
holding
cell
generally
for
that
15
minute
period
of
time.
then
he
was
returned
to
the
witness
stand.
mr.
donald
j.
zelenka
i
do
not
know
at
this
time.
i
do
not
know
that.
we
would
submit
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
determining
that
this
was
not
a
per
se
rule
that
should
be
applicable
as
a
total
denial
of
counsel,
that
this...
the
found
denial
of
access
to
counsel
is
not
the
situation
that
contaminated
the
entire
proceedings
like
the
situations
this
court
has
previously
looked
upon
in
making
its
determination
that
essentially
a
per
se
rule
should
be
applicable.
we
submit
that
counsel
in
this
case
clearly
reflects,
and
the
record
clearly
reflects
that
he
was
provided
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
that--
mr.
donald
j.
zelenka
--yes,
sir,
we
are
satisfied
with--
mr.
donald
j.
zelenka
--that
differs
with
the
determination
made
by
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
which
specifically
found
there
was
no
violation.
mr.
donald
j.
zelenka
then
it
looked
at
the
position
we--
mr.
donald
j.
zelenka
--there
may
not
be
a
bar
order.
the
fourth
circuit
had
previously
held
in
the
case
of
stubbs
v.
borden
kircher
and
the
case
of
u.s.
v.
allen
that
even
a
brief
break
possibly
of
one
or
two
minutes
was
a
denial
of
access
to
the--
mr.
donald
j.
zelenka
--there
has,
as
this
court
is
probably
well
aware,
there
have
been
other
state
decisions
in
florida
and
tennessee
and
in
maryland
that
have
similarly
involved
sequestrations
or
limited
sequestrations
during
a
trial
break
within
the
trial
day,
and
it's
our
position
that
that
significantly
distinguishes
this
case
from
the
geders
situation
because
here
the
break
was
so
remote
and
so
short
a
period
of
time
during
the
trial--
mr.
donald
j.
zelenka
--because
there
was
a
denial
of
access
to
counsel
during
that
particular
time
period,
that
is
correct.
unless
this
court
has
further
questions,
i'll
rest
at
this
time.
