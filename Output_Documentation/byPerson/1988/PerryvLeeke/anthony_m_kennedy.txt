justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
there's
a
difference
because
overnight
it's
necessarily
assumed
that
the
lawyer
and
the
client
will
have
many
things
to
talk
about
in
addition,
perhaps,
to
the
ongoing
testimony.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
you
have
a
10
or
15
minute
break
in
the
course
of
the
testimony,
it's
rather
unrealistic
to
assume
that
the
lawyer
is
going
to
say,
well,
do
you
think
after
you
get
through
we
ought
to
call
witness
x,
y
and
z.
you're
going
to
only
talk
about
the
testimony.
so
you've
got
a
break
that
is
so
short
that
the
judge
presumably
would
have
discretion
either
to
grant
it
or
not,
just
go
ahead
and
get
a
drink
of
water
later.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
if
he
grants
it,
to
assume
the
only
thing
he's
really
preventing
is
the,
is
a
brief
comment
about
the
ongoing
testimony.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
i
know,
but
is
it
not
fair
to
assume
the
only
thing
they're
going
to
talk
about
in
a
ten
minute
break
at
the
end
of
direct
examination,
before
cross
examination,
is
the
ensuing
cross
examination?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
not
true
of
an
overnight
break.
that's
not
true
of
an
overnight
break
necessarily,
at
least.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
they
may
not,
but
it's
customary
to
have
at
least
some
time
where
they
could
talk
about
the
things
that
might
develop
the
next
day.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
suppose
you
would
think
it
would
be
just
out
of
bounds
for
us
to
say
there
wasn't
any
violation
in
the
first
place.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
it
your
position
that
you
have
to
prove
prejudice
in
this
situation
to
prove
any
constitutional
violation
at
all?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
the
court
below
seemed
to
say
there
was
a
violation,
a
sixth
amendment
violation,
did
it,
but
that
it...
but
what,
no
new
trial
unless
there's
prejudice,
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
do
you
argue,
do
you
argue
here
that
that
was
proper
in
any
event,
or
admit
that
that
was
error?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
including
its
statement
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
fifth...
sixth
amendment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
if
you
are
happy
with
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment,
it
means
that,
i
supposed,
if
the
state
judges
see
that
unreversed,
that
there's
not
going
to
be
this
kind
of
a
bar
order
entered
in
state
trials
again.
it
will
just
be
wrong,
and
you
are
violating
the
sixth
amendment
to
keep
the
defendant
from
talking
to
his
counsel,
even
in
a
routine
recess.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
state
judges
haven't
paid
too
much
attention
to
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
court
of
appeals
still
thought
it
violated
the
sixth
amendment.
