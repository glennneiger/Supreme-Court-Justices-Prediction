mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
this
court
today
deals
with
a
geders
type
deprivation
of
counsel
during
an
afternoon,
15
minute
recess
in
the
middle
of
a
defendant's...
at
the
end
of
his
direct
examination,
prior
to
his
cross
examination.
the
petitioner's
position
is
that
this
should
be
subjected
to
a
per
se
prejudice
test
in
circumstances
where
five
basic
criteria
are
met.
this
court
has
traditionally
recognized
that
denial
of
counsel
during
the
course
of
a
trial
is
an
error
that,
because
of
its
nature,
deals
with
fundamental
fairness
in
the
criminal
process
of
our
country.
we
think
we
have
identified
basically
five
criteria
that
should
be
used
to
determine
whether
or
not
basically
the
defendant
has
been
prejudiced
by
an
order
of
the
court.
those
criteria
are
basically,
first,
that
a
trial
judge
issue
an
order
depriving
access
of
a
criminal
defendant
and
his
attorney;
second,
that
this
happened
during
a
critical
stage
of
the
criminal
process;
third,
that
it
happened
at
a
time
when
the
defendant
and
his
lawyer
would
normally
consult,
and
that
there
is
a
need
for
the
consultation;
fourth,
that
but
for
the
order
of
the
court,
the
consultation
would
have
taken
place;
and
fifth,
that
the
consultation
does
not
interfere
with
the
orderly
process
of
the
court.
now,
this
court
in
geders,
some
time
ago,
found
that
it
is
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
to
deprive
access
to
a
criminal
defendant
his
counsel
during
a
break.
admittedly,
that
break
was
an
overnight
recess.
the
break
at
issue
here
is
not
an
overnight
recess.
it
is--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--not
a
per
se
right,
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
should
be
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge
as
to
whether
it
interferes
with
the
normal
trial
process,
and
also,
depending
upon
the
reason
the
interruption
is
necessary.
again,
if...
it
goes
back
to
these
five
factors.
if
there's
something
that
has
occurred
during
the
course
of
the
trial
that
a
court
would
recognize
as
essential
to
the
attorney-client
relationship,
let's
say
a
witness,
even
a
normal
witness,
not
even
a
defendant,
if
they
have
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
an
answer
would
incriminate
them,
would
have
the
right
to
consult
with
an
attorney
before
answering
the
question.
if
that
situation
came
up
with
a
criminal
defendant,
obviously
they
have
no
less
of
a
sixth
amendment
right.
again,
it
would
be--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--again,
there
would
be
whether
or
not
the
trial
court
felt
it
was
appropriate,
and
the
reasons
given
by
the
defense
counsel.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
then
i
think
probably
we're
not
talking
about
a
per
se
test,
we're
talking
about
an
evaluation
of
the
harm
of
that
deprivation.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
based
upon
the
reason
the
defense
attorney
indicated--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--the
reason
is
because
he
wants
to
talk
with
him?
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
well,
the
essential
difference
in
a
situation
such
as
that
and
the
case
here
is
there
is
no
denial
of
right
to
counsel
where
the
counsel
and
the
defendant
are
in
the
same
courtroom.
they
are
available
to
each
other.
the
court
is
there
as
an
intermediary.
this
court
has
recognized
that
there
are
occasions
when
the
sixth
amendment
right
may
be
subjected
to
the
court's
right
to
conduct
the
trial.
that's
the
basic
test
for
any
case.
and
so
the
issue,
i
think
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
you're
bringing
up,
that
is
where
the
balancing
test
comes
in.
where
the
balancing
test
does
not
come--
--no,
sir,
not
demand;
can
request.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
depending
upon
how
important
his
request
was,
whether
it
went
to
an
area
of
constitutional
law.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
if
it
deals
with
the
fifth
amendment,
if
it
deals
with
the
fourth
amendment,
if
it
dealt
with
some
basic
right
that
the
defendant
has.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
yes,
sir,
i
understand
what
your
question
is.
my
problem
is
i
don't
think
that
that
is
a
constitutional
deprivation.
i
think
that
is
within
the
trial
court's
discretion,
but
that
is
an
entirely
different
situation
than
what
is
present
here.
i
think
also
in
this
balance--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--yes,
he
could
not--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--but
there's
a
difference
because
time
doesn't
stand
still
when
the
court
takes
a
break.
we
have
a
defendant,
and
i
think
maybe
the
facts
of
this
case
are
particularly
important
here
because
we
have
a
defendant
that
has
been
described
by
the
state's
doctors
as
childlike,
who
has
low
intelligence,
who
has
been
emotionally
ill,
who
has
been
committed
to
a
state
hospital
for
a
period
of
about
two
and
a
half
months,
who
has
suffered
from
amnesia
and
a
hysterical
reaction,
who
is
being,
after
being
treated
and
gotten
to
competency,
taken
to
trial.
his
basic
childlike
nature
has
not
changed.
he
is
still
a
man
in
child's
mind.
when
he
is
faced
with
a
situation
of
being
taken
out
of
the
courtroom
and
placed
in
a
very
small
room
with
no
window
and
no
other
person,
just
one
chair,
enclosed
in
about
a
six
by
six
room,
with
no
one
to
talk
to,
it
cannot
help
but
affect
his
performance
later
on
cross
examination.
additionally,
the
other
side
is
not
placed
in
this
room.
the
other
side
is
a
trained
advocate.
they
now
have
15
minutes
to
prepare
a
cross
examination
based
upon
what
they
have
just
heard
on
a
very
lengthy
direct
examination.
it's
not
an
even
trade
here.
in
effect,
this
fortuity
of
this
break
aids
the
state
and
penalizes
the
defendant.
and
for
this
reason,
as
a
trial
lawyer,
if
you
give
me
the
opportunity
before
any
witness
to
take
15
minutes
after
they've
been
on
direct,
i'm
in
a
much
better
position
to
conduct
my
cross
examination.
the
test
i
am
suggesting
for
this
court
avoids
this
problem
because
basically
when
this
court
tells
trial
judges
the
sixth
amendment
right
is
absolute,
if
you
do
it
under
these
circumstances
you
will
have
trouble.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
test
that
my
client
is
advocating
that
should
be
applied
as
to
whether
or
not
per
se
analysis
should
apply
to
situations
like
this,
primarily
i
think
the
fourth
criteria
is
the
one
that
should
be
determinative
of
whether
the
per
se
rule
applies
if
the
other
four
are
present.
the
other
four
are
fairly
easy
to
determine.
if
it's
during
a
break,
obviously
it
doesn't
interfere
with
the
trial
day.
the
trial
judge
obviously
would
have
to
make
some
type
of
order.
obviously
the
client
and
the
attorney
would
have
to
at
least
attempt
to
confer
or
notify
the
court
they
wanted
to
confer,
and
obviously
it
would
have
to
be
during
some
critical
stage
of
the
trial
process.
i
think
under
this
court's
prior
rulings
the
trial
itself
is
a
critical
stage,
so
i
don't
think
that
is
a
definite
enough
test
for
determining
whether
or
not
prejudice
should
apply
to
the
denial.
so
we
should
then
turn
to
whether
or
not
the
defendant
and
his
counsel
would
normally
confer,
and
would
the
subject
of
that
conference
be
something
of
importance
in
the
attorney-client
relationship.
to
adopt
a
test
which
i
think
is
being
advocated
by
the
state
that
time
somehow
has
a
difference
in
this
sets
a
very
arbitrary
standard.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
a
break
in
the
trial
where
it
would
not
be
likely
that
a
defendant
and
his
counsel
would
discuss
something
of
importance
would
not
be
critical.
if
it's
a
break
in
the
trial
where
they
would
be
likely
to
discuss
something
of
importance
is
critical,
and
important.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
that's
my
point.
the
second
element
of
our
test
is
that
it
be
during
a
critical
stage
of
the
trial
process.
that
can
be
outside
of
the
courtroom.
that
can
be
at
arraignment,
as
it
was
in
u.s.
v.
hamilton.
so
the
criteria
we
are
advocating
is
that
you
must
look
at
this
fourth
point,
that
it
is
the
time
they
would
normally
confer,
and
it's
something
of
importance
they
would
discuss.
in
this
case,
clearly,
it
was
of
importance.
it
was
an
upcoming
cross
examination
in
a
capital
murder
case
with
a
defendant
who
is
of
limited
mental
capabilities,
who
has
just
been
through
a
lengthy
direct
examination.
this
is
not
an
unusual
recess
that
occurred
in
this
case.
this
is
the
normal
afternoon
recess.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
justice
marshall,
don't
misunderstand
what
i'm
saying.
i
agree.
all
parts
are
critical.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
yes,
sir.
and
i'm
not
saying
that
it
is
all
right
for
a
trial
judge
to
deny
access
to
a
client
at
any
point.
my
point
is
that
i
think
the
court
is
searching
for
some
guide
or
some
point
at
which
denial
of
counsel--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--yes,
sir,
i
think
you
could.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
yes,
sir,
but
i
think
that
goes
back
to
that
fifth
point,
and
that
is
that
it
would,
if
it
would
interfere
with
the
orderly
process
of
the
trial
under
morris
v.
slapee,
then
clearly
the
trial
court
has
the
discretion,
as
long
as
his
motive
is
not
to
just
interfere
with
that
relationship.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
your
honor,
i
think
you
have
presented
the
issue
which
i
think...
i
think
they
would
because
i
think
the
trial
court,
if
its
motive
is
to
prevent
a
proper
attorney-client
conference
that
they
would
normally
have
allowed--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--yes,
sir,
and
if
that
is
the
trial
court's--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--well,
geders
basically
said
that
if
the
trial
judge
has
reason
to
believe
that
something
improper
is
going
to
take
place,
not
proper
advice--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
yes,
sir,
i
do
think
that's
improper
because
i
think
basically
the
trial
judge
is
interfering
with...
if
the
trial
judge
would
have
normally
taken
a
break--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--i'm
sure
it
was.
i'm
not
saying
it
was
proper
before.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
yes,
sir,
because
geders
recognized
that
the
sequestration
rule
that
was
sort
of
embodied,
let's
say,
in
our
system,
which
was
when
it
was
used,
it
was
used
to
everybody,
geders
changed
that,
and
it
clearly
established
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
outweighed
the
purpose
of
the
sequestration
rule,
and
the
sequestration
rule
made
no
sense
when
it
was
applied
to
a
criminal
defendant.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
the
common
law
sequestration
rule
for
witnesses,
your
honor,
that
if
at
any
trial,
if
one
party
or
the
other
requests
the
trial
judge
to
sequester
all
witnesses
prior
to
their
testimony
so
they
wouldn't
tailor
their
testimony--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--no,
sir.
we
talk
about
only
the
break,
during
the
break
between...
it
is
not
at
all
unusual
in
a
lengthy
criminal
case
for
a
criminal
defendant's
testimony
to
be
lengthy
on
direct.
it
is
not
at
all
unusual
for
there
to
be
a
break,
either
the
morning,
the
afternoon,
the
luncheon
or
the
evening
recess,
between
the
direct
and
cross.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
no,
sir,
i'm
not
saying
he
can't
do
that.
i'm
saying
if
his
motive
is
to
prevent
communication,
proper
communication
between--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--your
honor,
i
understand
this
court's
view.
my--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--your
view,
i'm
sorry.
my
point
is
if
the
motive
of
the
trial
judge
is
simply
to
prevent
a
proper
communication
from
taking
place,
it
appears
to
me
that
would
be
in
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment.
whether
that
should
be
held
to
a
per
se
error
i
think
is
a
different
issue.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
yes.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
i'm
sorry,
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
the
court's
question.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
if
i
understand
your
question,
i
think
basically--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
yes,
sir,
i
understand,
and
if--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--no,
sir,
i
didn't
say
it
was
always
improper.
i
said
as
long
as--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--it
is
proper
if
it
is
within
his
morris
v.
slapee
role
of
controlling
the
conduct
of
the
trial.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
then
i
think
under
the
analysis
we
have
given,
i
think
that
it
would
be
a
question
for
the
appellate
court
as
to
whether
or
not
the
motive
of
the
judge
was
to
deprive
the
client
of
a
right
he
normally
would
have
gotten
in
a
trial
of
this
nature.
i
agree--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--if
they
find
that
the
motive
was
to
not
deny
the
defendant--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--your
honor,
the
sixth
amendment--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--not
simply,
no,
sir,
because
i
think
each
situation
must
be
judged
on
its
own
merits.
the
situation
you
have
given
me,
you
are
assuming
that
the
trial
judge
is
acting
with
proper
motives,
and
he,
it
is
his
belief
or
her
belief
that
it
is
best
in
cross
examination
to
continue
straight
through.
if
that
is
that
trial
judge's
common
practice
and
he
hasn't
chosen
that
one
defendant
to
do
that
to,
then
clearly
i
think
it
would
not
be
error.
but
if,
on
the
other
hand,
in
one
case
this
trial
judge
decides
on
this
defendant,
i
don't
want
him
to
talk
to
his
lawyer--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--as
long
as
you
do
it
uniformly.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
this
issue
is
admittedly
outside
the
issue
in
this
case,
because
clearly
there
was
a
break
taken
here,
and
i
understand
the
court's
concern
in
this
area.
the
court
clearly
does
not
have
to
rule
in
this
area
to
resolve
this
case.
but
i
think
if
a
trial...
the
purpose
of
the
sixth--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--well,
that
gets
back
to
the
issue
that
i
have
raised
which
is,
i
think,
the
test
needs
to
be
the
importance
of
the
conference.
if...
in
this
case,
clearly
there
was
a
break.
clearly
there
was
no
interference
with
the
judge's
ability
to
control
what
happened
in
the
courtroom.
there
would
have
been
no
interference
on
anybody.
the
only
thing
that
happened
was
the
client
was
isolated
and
he
was
denied
access
to
his
counsel.
the
same
thing
happened
in
geders,
the
only
difference
being
that
it
was
an
overnight
recess
rather
than
a
15
minute
recess.
and
it
we
are
going
to
start
trying
to
set
arbitrary
lines
in
saying,
okay,
a
lawyer's
advice
is
not
good
if
it's
for
15
minutes
but
it
is
good
if
it's
for
overnight,
or
that
it's
more
important
to
talk
to
a
client
about
strategy
overnight
than
it
is
to
talk
about
an
approaching
cross
examination
when
you're
on
trial
for
your
life--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
yes,
sir,
i
agree.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
well,
he's
preventing
communication
between
the
client
and
the...
he
is
preventing
communication
of
any
type
between
a
lawyer--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--i
think
that
is
one,
probably
the
most
likely
thing
they
would
talk
about,
but
it
doesn't
limit--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--well,
the
problem
is
they
may
not
talk
at
all
in
an
overnight
break
anyway.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
yes,
sir,
but
in
my
experience,
generally
it's
not
much
more
than
15
minutes.
i
mean,
in
a
trial
of
this
nature
the
lawyer
has
many
things
to
prepare
for,
not
the
least
of
which
is
his
client's
testimony.
he
is
going
to
spend
or
she
is
going
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
preparing
that
client
for
that
testimony.
depending
upon
the
client
you're
dealing
with,
and
if
you
are
dealing
with
a
donald
ray
perry,
you
have
to
spend
more
time,
and
if
you--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--i
was
that
lawyer,
your
honor,
and
we
wished--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--well,
i
had...
what
i
had
sent
was
my
co-counsel,
ed
mullineaux,
to
talk
with
him,
to
go
over
again
the
principles
we
had
earlier
talked
about
because
we
knew
donald
ray.
donald
ray
was
childlike.
you
could
tell
him
something
and
ten
minutes
later...
i
think
if
you
examine
the
cross
examination
you
can
tell
this.
he
acts
like
a
child.
when
he
is
attacked,
he
attacks
back.
he
gives
somewhat
irrational
answers
to
questions.
on
the
fifth
question
asked
by
the
prosecutor
he
didn't
even
answer,
and
at
about
the
tenth
or
twelfth
question,
the
trial
judge
had
to
instruct
him
to
properly
answer
the
questions.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
go
over
with
him
again
the
importance
of
listening
to
the
question
on
cross
examination,
answer
the
question,
and
whatever
you
do,
don't
argue
with
the
prosecutor;
also
to
find
out
did
he
have
any
questions,
was
there
anything
we
didn't
go
over
on
direct
examination
he
wanted
to
get
before
the
court,
so
either
we
could
do
it
by
requesting
the
trial
judge
to
let
us
reopen
direct
or
get
it
in
rebuttal;
additionally,
find
out
is
there
anything
else
that
had
happened
during
his
direct
examination
that
bothered
him.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
yes,
sir,
it
did.
every
court
has
held
it
was
error.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
that
it
was
a
sixth
amendment
violation,
that
there
was
no
interference--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--well,
what
they
held
was
that--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--no,
they...
my
reading
of
their
opinion
is
they
found
clearly
it
was
a
sixth
amendment
violation
because
it
violated
the
spirit
of
the
rule
in
geders,
as
every
other
circuit
court
other
than
the
second
circuit
in
the
united
states
found,
that
have
extended
geders
to
short
recesses,
but
they
then
applied...
they
said
this
court's
decisions
in
strickland
and
cronic
somehow
changed
the
law
as
it
applied
to
routine
recesses
during
the
trial
day.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
that
is
in
the
ineffective
assistance
counsel
area.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
strickland
and
cronic
specifically
recognized
that
the
rule
of
cronic
and
the
rule
in
chapman
v.
united
states
is
inapplicable
to
three
areas
of
law:
a
biased
tribunal,
a
denial
of
counsel,
and
a
coerced
confession.
it
has
been
traditional--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--that's
part
of
my
point,
your
honor,
that
if
you
tell
the
trial
judges,
don't
deprive...
if
you
take
a
break
in
the
trial,
don't
deprive
the
client
of
access
to
his
counsel,
there's
no
reason
to
do
it
unless
you
feel
that
something
improper
is
going
to
take
place,
and
then
put
that
reason
on
the
record
and
continue
the
trial
through
direct
examination.
that's
what
this
court
said
to
do
in
geders.
but
to
draw
a
line
and
say
arbitrarily,
overnight
is
too
long,
15
minutes
is
not
long
enough,
it's
like
the
fourth
circuit
said,
the
dissent
said,
in
effect,
we
are
creating
a
line
and
saying
everything
on
this
side
of
the
line
is
per
se
error
but
everything
on
this
side
of
the
line
is
per
se
harmless.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
my
experience
is,
if
you
are
going
to
deny
him
access
during
the
break,
don't
take
the
break.
don't
give
them
the
opportunity
to
prepare
and
isolate
my
client.
if
you're
going
to
let
him
have
an
equal
right
so
he
can
better
prepare
for
the
upcoming
cross
examination,
then
give
us
the
break.
i
don't
really...
one
way
or
the
other
doesn't
matter
to
me,
but
if
you're
going
to
take
the
break,
at
least
give
him
an
equal
opportunity.
don't
give
them
the
advantage
and
then
hold
him
in
isolation
where
he
has
no
ally.
his
only
friend
in
the
courtroom
is
his
lawyer,
and
yet
you're
taking
him
and
you're
sticking
him
in
this
small
room
where
there's
a
deputy
outside
and
you're
not
letting
anybody
talk
with
him,
and
you're
saying
this
somehow
is
helping
him
approaching
cross
examination.
i
would
much
prefer
to
not
have
the
break.
at
least
he
doesn't
have
that
added
agitation
of
being
hold
incommunicado.
imagine
taking
a
small,
a
child,
and
placing
them
in
a
small
room
before
the
most
important
test
in
their
life,
and
holding
them
there
for
15
minutes
and
expecting
them
to
do
well
on
this
test.
i
think
that
goes
against
reason,
and
yet
that
is
what
is
happening
in
these
cases.
the
court
has
traditionally...
60
years
the
court
has
said
denial
of
counsel
is
per
se
error.
what
we
are
suggesting
is
adopt
a
test
similar
to
the
cutler
v.
sullivan
test
which
simply
says
once
you
have
demonstrated...
the
prejudice
is
demonstrated
by
the
denial.
the
denial,
once
it
is
established,
we
don't
go
into
prejudice.
if
it
is
a
time
when
they
would
normally
confer,
and
it
is
important
that
they
confer
at
that
time,
and
the
trial
court
has
taken
the
break,
don't
deny
them
access.
there's
no
reason
to.
and
it
is
much
easier
for
the
trial
courts
to
follow
a
per
se
rule
than
to
have
to
get
into
prejudice
in
every
case.
the
only--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
yes,
sir.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
it
was
subject
to
a
prejudice
test
and
found
that
pursuant
to
the
strickland
test,
we
had
not
demonstrated
any
prejudice--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--they
haven't
made
that
argument
yet.
the
only
argument
in
the
court
below
was
that
since
the
defendant
didn't
make
the
request,
there
was
no
showing
that
he
needed
the
request,
but
of
course,
in
geders
the
defendant
didn't
make
the
request
either.
the
objection
was
entered
by
the
attorney,
as
in
every
one
of
these
cases
that
is
the
case,
and
that
was
rejected
by
both
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
district
court.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
i
would
hope
you
wouldn't
take
that
position
because
clearly
there
was
a
situation
where
he
was
isolated
and
he
was
denied
access
to
his
counsel
during
what
i
consider
the
most
critical
period
during
this
trial.
i
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
i
have
left
for
rebuttal.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
thank
you,
your
honor.
first,
justice
scalia,
there
was
no
notice
that
this
order
was
going
to
take
place
until
we
attempted
to
consult
with
counsel.
so
your
question
to
the
state's
attorney
concerning
could
we
have
objected
to
the
break,
we
didn't
know
we
were
going
to
be
denied
access
until
we
attempted
to
have
access.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
yes.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
yes,
sir,
i
believe
it
does
because
i
think
the
right
to
counsel
is
much
more
than
just
a
legal
aspect.
you
are
the
advisor.
that's
why
we
call
then
counsellors.
we
don't
call
them
necessarily
just
attorneys.
we
aid
the
client
much
more
than
just
fourth
amendment,
fifth
amendment,
sixth
amendment,
eighth
amendment.
we
help
them
know
how
to
try
a
case.
i
teach
trial
lawyers
how
to
try
cases.
a
big
part
of
what
we
teach
is,
is
humanizing
that
client
and
getting
to
know
that
client,
and
getting
that
client
to
trust
you
so
that
he
will
turn
to
you,
seek
your
advice,
and
trust
you.
if
we
start
depriving
access
of
the
criminal
defendant
to
that
one
friend
in
the
courtroom,
we
are
destroying
the
concept
of
this
attorney-client
relationship.
i
think
it
is
much
more
important
than
just
you
are
the
mouthpiece
in
the
courtroom,
and
there
i
think
is
where
the
extremity,
the
real
prejudice
in
this
situation
comes
in.
but
it
is
much
more,
it
is
prejudice
to
the
concept
that
we
have
recognized
that,
since
hamilton,
that
you
don't
deny
a
criminal
defendant
access
to
his
counsel
without
a
good
reason.
and
we
have
found
it
is
not
a
good
reason
that
they
may
talk
about
upcoming
cross
examination,
particularly
when
there's
no
fear
that
you're
going
to
improperly
talk
about
it,
only
that
you're
going
to
discuss
the
rules
of
cross
examination.
there's
no
reason
to
deny
it.
there
is
every
reason
in
the
world
to
discourage
this
type
of
activity.
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
dissent
in
the
fourth
circuit
i
think
raised
a
good
point.
this
was
not
a
case
of
overwhelming
evidence.
the
jury
was
out
two
full
days
and
almost
hung
up
on
the
issue
of
guilt.
there
was
a
substantial
duress
defense
presented.
there
was
forensic
evidence
introduced...
and
i'm
sorry,
i
have
finished
my
time.
thank
you.
