justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
to
say
the
trial
is
a
critical
stage,
as
we
have...
that's
self-evidence...
is
not
necessarily
to
say
that
a
break
in
the
trial
is
a
critical
stage,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
takes
a
little
more
analysis
than
just
saying
it
was
the
trial
and
therefore
it's
a
critical
stage.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
can
do
it
so
long
as
you
do
it
a
lot?
that
doesn't
violate
the
constitution.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
only
if
you
occasionally
do
it
that
it's
bad.
that
doesn't
make
a
whole
lot
of
sense,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
one
sheds
some
light
on
the
other.
if
it's
okay
for
a
judge
to
say
no,
i
insist,
you
know,
it's
the
last
scene
of
a
perry
mason
trial,
and
the
witness
is
just
about
to
break
down,
and
counsel
says
i'd
like
to
confer
with
my
client,
and
the
judge
says
no
way,
this
witness
is
about
to
break
down;
if
that
is
okay,
i
don't
know
why
it
might
not
similarly
be
okay
for
a
judge
to
say,
well,
all
right,
we'll
take
a
brief
recess
but
i
don't
want
counsel's
coaching,
whatever
counsel
is
going
to
do,
to
interfere
with
the
process
of
this
examination.
that
might
also
be
okay.
if
the
one
is,
there's
some
possibility
the
other
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
it
will
serve
the
interests
of
defendants
like
your
client
in
the
future
who
are
childlike
and
easily
confused
to
in
effect
compel
the
trial
judge
to
continue
with
the
examination
instead
of
allowing
a
break
in
which
at
least
the
defendant
can
collect
his
own
thoughts
even
if
he
can't
confer
with
his
counsel?
as
between
those
two,
which
would
you
prefer?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
zelenka,
your
position
that
it's
okay
here
because
there's
generally
no
right
to
speak
to
your
counsel
between
direct
and
cross
examination
or
between
cross
and
redirect,
that
position
would
apply
even
if
the
recess
were
overnight,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
would
say
that
even
if
he
were
deprived
of
access
to
counsel
overnight,
so
long
as
that
overnight
break
occurred
between
direct
and
cross,
that
would
be
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then,
you
must
be
relying
on
something
different
from
the
principle
you
just
expressed.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
maybe
counsel
should
object
to
the
recess.
maybe
counsel
should
object
to
the
recess.
if
counsel
is
told
that
the
recess
will
be
one
without
his
opportunity
to
confer
with
his
client,
and
if
he
knows
his
client
is
likely
to
get
upset
in
a
15
minute
holding
period
without
counsel,
he
should
object
to
the
recess.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
affected,
as
justice
stevens
is,
about
the
prospect
that
you
paint
of
your
client
sitting
all
alone
in
a
cell
and
having
to
worry
for
15
minutes,
but
is
that
the
reason
we
provide
counsel?
i
thought
the
right
to
counsel
is
the
right
to
legal
assistance,
that
the
reason
we
provide
it
is
because
the
state
has
legally
trained
people
at
its
disposal
and
this
fellow
is
helpless
before
the
state.
i
mean,
we're
talking...
what
you're
complaining
about
is
something
different.
maybe
they
should
have
let
his
mother
go
into
the
cell,
or
his
best
friend
or
something
else,
but
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
the
right
to
counsel?
or
maybe
you
have
an
objection
for
keeping
him
incommunicado
for
15
minutes,
but
does
it
have
anything
to
do
with
the
right
to
counsel?
