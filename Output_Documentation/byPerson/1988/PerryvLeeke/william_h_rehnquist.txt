chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
donald
ray
perry
v.
william
d.
leeke.
mr.
fairey,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
a
defendant
at
the
close
of
cross
examine...
defendant
takes
the
stand,
cross
examination
by
the
state.
at
the
close
of
that
cross
examination,
before
re-examination
by
the
defense,
the
defense
attorney
says
i
want
to
consult
with
my
client
before
i
go
into
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
the
trial
court
says
in
effect
just
what
the
trial
court
here
said,
that
you're
not
entitled
to
discuss
with
your
client
anytime
you
want
to
during
court
proceedings
these
things.
this
is
not
a
recess,
and
so
you
can't
do
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
how
do
you
evaluate
that
particular
situation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
i've
given
you
the
reason.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
reason
he
wants
to
talk
it
over
and
get
something,
make
sure
the
guy
knows
what's
going
to
be,
he's
examined
about
on
rebuttal.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
supposing
the
request
is
turned
down,
what's
the
constitutional
result
of
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
does
one
go
to
an
area
of
constitutional
law
in
such
a
request?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
it
deals
with
just
what
we're
talking
about
here;
the
defense
lawyer
says
something
has
come
up
on
cross
examination,
and
i
want
to
redirect
my
client.
i
just
want
to
talk
to
him
before
i
do
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
fairey,
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
fairey,
you
may
resume.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
you're
saying,
thought,
is
that
a
trial
judge
who
in
my
opinion
might
rightfully
believe
that
the
best
way
to
get
at
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
the
art
of
cross
examination,
as
wigmore
said,
that
it
serves
the
judicial
process
to
have
the
witness,
if,
you
know,
within
feasible
limits,
get
the
direct,
the
cross,
and
perhaps
the
redirect
out
of
the
way.
you're
saying
he
can't
do
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
his...
the
judge's
view
in
my
hypothesis
is
that
it's
not
desirable
to
have
communication
between
the
lawyer
and
the
witness
right
in
the
middle
of
the
witness's
examination,
at
either
the
end
of
direct
or
at
the
end
of
cross.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
was
my
view,
not
the
court's
view.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
with
justice
kennedy's,
you
know
the
motive
of
the
trial
judge.
so
what
is
the
answer
that
the
appellate
court
gives?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
is
the
motive
of
a
trial
judge
who
feels
just
what
justice
kennedy
has
stated
to
you,
is
that
an
improper
motive?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
you
answer
the
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
fairey.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
zelenka.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
zelenka,
you
refer
to
this
as
a
nonroutine
recess,
but
don't
courts
in
south
carolina
generally
take
an
afternoon
recess?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
i
recognize
that,
but
i
don't
know
that
you
can
necessarily
distinguish
the
overnight
recess
in
geders
from
the
much
shorter
recess
here
by
whether
one
is
routine
and
the
other
is
not
routine.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
zelenka.
mr.
fairey,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
fairey.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
87-6325,
perry
against
leeke
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
