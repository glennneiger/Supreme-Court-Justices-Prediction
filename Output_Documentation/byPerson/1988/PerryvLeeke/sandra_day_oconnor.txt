well,
could
this,
could
this
trial
judge
have
just
not
taken
a
break
between
direct
and
cross
examination?
justice
sandra

o'connor
and
the
same
result
would
have
obtained,
there
wouldn't
have
been
an
opportunity
to
consult.

fundamental
fairness
is
a
due
process
inquiry.
i
just
don't
understand
what
you're
talking
about.
a
sixth
amendment
violation
doesn't
turn,
does
it,
on
fundamental
fairness?
that's
a
due
process
inquiry.
