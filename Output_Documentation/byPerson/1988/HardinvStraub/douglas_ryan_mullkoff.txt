mr.
douglas
ryan
mullkoff
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
a
federal
court
hearing
a
state
prisoner's
section
1983
claim
must
apply
that
state's
prisoner
tolling
statute.
we
claim
that
the
tolling
statute
must
apply
in
light
of
this
court's
previous
decisions
and
in
light
of
the
plain
language
of
the
civil
rights
act.
the
record
below
in
this
case
is
scant.
in
1986,
petitioner
hardin
filed
a
section
1983
action
claiming
a
due
process
violation
by
a
michigan
prison
official
who
ignored
michigan
department
of
correction
rules
which
required
a
hearing
be
held
before
he
could
be
confined
in
a
solitary
segregation
unit.
almost
six
months
were
spent
in
segregation
without
any
hearing,
much
of
the
time
in
his
cell
24
hours
a
day.
this
segregation
ended
in
1981.
the
federal
lawsuit
was
filed
in
1986.
the
district
court
below
dismissed
this
case
sua
sponte
prior
to
service
on
the
defendant
finding
that
it
was
barred
by
michigan's
three-year
general
statute
of
limitations.
petitioner
argued
on
appeal
to
the
sixth
circuit
that
the
statute
of
limitations
was
tolled
under
michigan
statute
of
limitations
law
since
there
is
a
particular
michigan
tolling
provision
which
allows
an
inmate
whose
cause
of
action
accrues
during
imprisonment
until
one
year
after
the
imprisonment
ends
to
file
any
civil
suit
which
has
accrued
during
that
imprisonment.
the
sixth
circuit
rejected
this
argument
and
said
that
the
michigan
statute
of
limitation
tolling
rule
for
prisoners
does
not
apply
to
section
1983
claims.
we
believe
that
the
sixth
circuit
was
wrong
and
should
be
reversed.
the
particular
tolling
rule
in
question
was
rewritten
by
the
michigan
legislature
in
1972.
it
was
amended
from
a
five-year
tolling
period
after
incarceration
ended
to
a
one-year
period.
it
was
reviewed
again
in
1981
by
the
michigan
legislature
and
upheld.
this
court
has
made
unambiguous
pronouncements
on
the
use
of
state
statute
of
limitations
tolling
law.
in
tomanio,
a
1980...
1980
decision
of
this
court,
you
said
that
federal
courts
hearing
actions
under
section
1983
must
borrow
the
relevant
state
statute
of
limitation
and
tolling
rules
unless
they're
inconsistent
with
federal
law.
in
chardon
v.
fumero
soto
in
1983,
this
court
said
that
application
of
interrelated
tolling
rules,
when
state
statute
of
limitations
law
is
borrowed,
are
appropriate
and
must...
must
be
used
in
that
manner
unless
they're
inconsistent.
this
court
has
in
total
since
1980
reviewed
the
application
of
specific
state
limitation
statutes
to
civil
rights
cases
six
times.
that
body
of
law
has
established
that
state
statute
of
limitations
and
their
interrelated
tolling
rules
must
be
applied
unless
the
state
statute
interferes
with
or
unduly
burdens
assertion
of
the
civil
rights
claim.
the
michigan
tolling
rule
in
question
here
does
not
interfere
with
assertion
of
section
1983
claims.
in
fact,
it's
our
position
that
it
accommodates
section
1983
claims.
borrowing
a
state's
tolling
rules
is...
is
the
rule;
not
borrowing
would
be
an
exception.
and
under
the
procedural
statute
which
applies
to
section
1983,
that
being
1988,
it
must
be
borrowed
unless
inconsistent.
the
central
issue
raised
by
the
respondent
is
that
michigan's
tolling
rule
is
inconsistent
with
section
1983
because
it
does
not
foster
deterrence
of
official
misconduct.
i'd
first
like
to
point
out
that
this
court
in
felder
v.
casey
last
year
said
that
compensation
is
the
primary
goal
of
section
1983,
the
central
objective.
compensation
is
well-served
by
a
rule
which
extends
a
victim's
time
to
file
a
civil
rights
claim,
like
the
rule
in
this
case.
to
date,
this
court
has
not
rejected
any
state
law
which
made
access
to
the
courts
easier
for
persons
who
claim
to
be
victims
of
civil
rights
violations.
the
second
objective,
deterrence,
is
not
interfered
with
or
impeded
by
a
statute
of
limitations
tolling
rule.
our
position
is
that
the
greater
period
of
time
a
victim
has
to
file,
the
greater
the
deterrence...
the
deterrent
effect
will
be.
if
we
believe
that
giving
prisoners
access
to
court
will
actually
deter
section
1983
claims,
then
it
only
follows
that
giving
greater
access
to
prisoners
will
foster
greater
deterrence.
mr.
douglas
ryan
mullkoff
i'm
sorry.
mr.
douglas
ryan
mullkoff
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
disagree
with
the
idea
that
you
can
deter
official
misconduct,
that...
that
it
is
not
possible
to
deter
official
misconduct
with
a
tolling
provision
or
a
lengthy
period
of
time.
respondents
argue
that
promptness
and
a
promptly
filed
claim
fosters
deterrence
and
that
the
opposite
is
not
true.
we...
we
don't
believe
that
that
necessarily
follows.
in
criminal
law,
for
instance,
tolling
provisions
are
used
in
statute
of
limitations
systems
using
criminal
codes.
it
wouldn't
be
argued
that
we
should
abandon
statute
of
limitations
tolling
provisions
in
criminal
law
because
it
wouldn't
foster
deterrence.
i
think
the
opposite
is
more
persuasive,
that
the
greater
the
period
of
time
for
bringing
charges,
the
greater
the
deterrent
effect
would
be.
presumably
the
greatest
deterrence
in
a
civil
rights
case
occurs
when
a
victim
prevails
in
a
court
of
law.
we
think
that
there
are
other
reasons
based
on
this
court's
past
decisions
which
should
support
our
view.
the
congress
has
made
clear
in
section
1988
that
it
was
willing
to
rely
on
a
state's
judgment
regarding
statute
of
limitations
law.
the
concept
of
federalism
would
be
supported
by
applying
michigan's
tolling
law.
the
state
of
michigan
has
considered
and
reconsidered
this
law
written
and
rewritten
the
law,
and
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
has
reviewed
it.
in
1981
there
was
a
constitutional
challenge
to
this
particular
tolling
law,
and
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
found
it
to
be
supported
by
valid
governmental
interests.
respecting
the
legislature's
wishes
here
would
promote
federalism.
it
isn't
disputed
that
the
michigan
courts
would
apply
this
tolling
law
to
a
civil
rights
claim
were
it
brought
in
their
courts.
mr.
douglas
ryan
mullkoff
that...
that
appears
to
be
settled
by
the
case
of
hawkins
v.
justin
that
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
decided,
and
it
was
also
acknowledged
in
higley
v.
michigan
department
of
corrections,
the
sixth
circuit
case
that
respondents
rely
on.
the
final--
mr.
douglas
ryan
mullkoff
--the
legislative
committee
report
in
the
19...
to
the
1972
amendment
to
michigan's
tolling
statute
indicated
a
recognition
that
prisoners
in
modern
times
have
increased
access
to
courts.
they
acknowledge
the
fact
that
lawsuits
can
be
filed,
counsel
can
be
obtained,
and
that
although
prisoners
may
not
be
permitted
to
actually
appear
in
court,
they
can
file
their
actions.
the
committee
said,
nonetheless,
we
still
think
that
restrictions
obviously
exist
and
that
it
would
be
prudent
to
leave
a
one-year
window.
that
was
the
legislature's
comment
in
that
amendment.
a
final
point
i
think
that
should
be
made
is
that
statute
of
limitations
provisions
and
their
tolling
exceptions
have
to
be
read
and
viewed
in
context.
they're
inseparable.
this
court
has
said
in
the
past
that
one
cannot
understand
a
statute
of
limitations
system
without
understanding
its...
its
exceptions
and
those
circumstances
that
suspend
it
from
running
against
a
particular
cause
of
action.
it
is
problematic
to
separate
a
tolling
provision
from
a
parent
statute
of
limitations,
and
again
i
think
deference
should
be
paid
to
the
state
and
what
the
state's
wishes
were.
we
think
that
application
of
michigan's
tolling
law
seems
mandated
by
this
court's
past
decisions
in
tomanio
and
in
chardon,
and
we
urge
you
on
this
basis
to
reverse.
thank
you.
mr.
douglas
ryan
mullkoff
brief
rebuttal.
we
disagree
with
the
respondent's
contention
that
there
is
a
federal
policy
of
repose.
repose
is
a
purpose
of
statutes
of
limitations
systems.
congress
hasn't
enacted
a
statute
of
limitations
system.
they
can
if
they
choose
to.
statute
of
limitations
issues
have
been
deferred
in
1983
cases
to
the
states.
that's
congress'
decision.
repose
is
a
state
interest,
not
a
federal
interest.
it
can't
be
fairly
characterized
as
one
of
the
purposes
of
section
1983.
virtually
all
of
the
reasons
urged
for
affirmance
by
mr.
caruso
would
require
the
court
to
undertake
a
state-by-state,
case-by-case
review
of
tolling
statutes
to
see
if
the
statutes
conflict
with
the
purpose
of
section
1983.
we
believe
that
this
court,
through
its
decisions
in
okura
in
january
of
1988
and
in
wilson
v.
garcia,
has
moved
in
the
opposite
direction
to
simplify
the
rules
relating
to
application
of
a
statute
of
limitations
to
avoid
that
unnecessary
litigation
on
collateral
matters.
we
urge
the
court
to
continue
this
policy
approach
set
out
in
wilson
and
okura
and
to
reverse
the
lower
courts.
thank
you.
