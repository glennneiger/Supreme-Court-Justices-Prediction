scalia
mr.
caruso,
surely
there
are
some
policies
in
both
directions.
i
mean,
i
could
make
an
argument
precisely
the
opposite
of
what
you
say.
i
could
make
an
argument
to
say
that
it...
it
really...
it
expects
a
lot
of
a
prisoner
to
suggest
that
he
should
bring
a
suit
against
his
prison
guard,
for
example,
when
he
is
still
incarcerated
and
subject
to
the
authority
of
that
guard.
i...
i
think
it's
just
the
opposite
of
what
you're
saying
could...
could...
could
be
the
rule;
that
is,
you
have
to
allow
him
some
time
after
he
gets
out
of
prison
to
bring
this
claim
because
otherwise
you're
not
sure
the
claims
would
be
brought
at
all.
don't
you
think
there's
some
sense
in
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
do
you
want
to
have
to
sue
somebody
who's...
who's
the...
the
guard
on
your
corridor?
you
want
to
haul
him
into
court
while
you're
still
in
prison?
justice
antonin
scalia
wouldn't
you
rather
have
the
option
to
wait
until
you
get
out
and
then
sue
him?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
at
least
an
argument,
isn't
it?
i--
