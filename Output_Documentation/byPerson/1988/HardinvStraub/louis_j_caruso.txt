mr.
louis
j.
caruso
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
although
the
statutes
of
limitations
and
their
tolling
rules
are
part
of
the
judicial
process,
the
state
legislatures
do
not
design
their
statutes
of
limitations
and
tolling
provisions
with
the
national
interest
in
mind.
when
statutes
of
limitations
are
borrowed
from
the
state
pursuant
to
1988,
as
here,
the
courts
must
determine
whether
they
are
inconsistent
with
the
national
interest.
although
the
federal
courts
in
michigan
have
not
looked
with
disfavor
upon
the
policy
of
repose
of
the
state,
the
sixth
circuit...
they
have...
they
have
rejected,
however,
the
open-ended
tolling
statute
with
the
sixth
circuit
approval
as
being
inconsistent
with
the
underlying
remedial
policies
and
purposes
of
the
civil
rights
act
which
are
identified
as
both
deterrence
and
compensation.
the
sixth
circuit
decided
the
case
based
on
higley,
which
is
an
earlier
decision
by
the
sixth
circuit,
in
which
they
placed
a
strong
emphasis
on
the
court's
perceived
substantive
policy
of
early
enforcement
of
the
civil
rights
act.
the
court
reasoned
that
because
deterrence
of
the
civil
rights
violation
is
the
act's
objective...
one
of
the
act's
objectives,
such
claims
should
not
be
allowed
to
long...
languish
long
after
the
best
opportunity
for
resolution
and
deterrence
is
past.
and
i
also
suggest
to
the
court
that
compensation
in
and
of
itself
has
a
deterrent
effect
in
this
area.
the
court
considered
this
perception
of
early
resolution
not
in
light
of
fixed
tolling
statutes
such
as
six,
eight
or
ten
years,
but
rather
under
a
tolling
statute
allowing
varying
claim
viability
periods
that
are
dependent
upon...
upon
claimant
prisoner's
duration
of
sentence,
which
in
some
cases
could
extend
for
decades,
and
found
it
unacceptable
in
view
of
its
perceived
need
for
prompt
enforcement
of
the
civil
rights
act.
now,
the
petitioner
asserts
the
longer
the
statute
of
limitations,
the
greater
the
deterrent
value.
while
it
may
be
true
that
permitting
litigation
of
stale
claims
has
a
more...
has
more
deterrent
value
than
prohibiting
them,
it
cannot
be
realistically
denied
nor...
and
it's
equally
true
that
prompt
litigation
increases
the
likelihood
of
success
and
deterrence.
petitioner
analyzes
deterrence
and
isolation--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--yes.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
the
court
would
have
to
make
that
judgment.
they
would
have
to
balance
the
need
for
early
decision
against
the...
the
period
of
15
years.
in
other
words,
they'd
have
to
determine
whether
the
interest
in
protecting
the
claim
for
a
15-year
period
is
outweighed
by
the
federal
policy
of
repose.
and
if
it's
15
years,
it's...
it's
a
value
judgment--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--that
could
be
determined
by
the
court
as
being
too
long,
and
if
that's
the
case,
they
would...
pursuant
to
1988
and
the
tomanio
analysis,
it
should
not
be
applied.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
it
had
within
its
own
power
to
change
that.
i
agree
with...
i
agree,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
they
chose
not
to
do
that.
however,
when
we...
when
we
borrow
such
a
statute,
i
think
we
have
to
consider
it
in
light
of
the
federal
interests
as
required
by
1988
and
tomanio.
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
federal
interest
of
repose
and
finality
would
indicate...
could
conclude
that
the
statute
does
not
comport
with
the
federal
interest
on...
in
repose
simply
because
the
michigan
tolling
statute
could
permit
claims...
a
viability
period
to
exist
for
a
period,
as
i
say,
of
decades,
40
years
or
50
years
in
some
cases.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
yes.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
yes,
[inaudible].
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
that's,
indeed,
unfortunate.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
but
as
i
suggest
that
while
the
stale
claim
have...
has...
the
question
is
not
whether
a
stale
claim
has
any
deterrent
effect
or
whether
a
deterrent
effect
of
the
state
claim
outweighs
the
federal
interest
in
repose,
as
i
suggest.
in
making
this
judgment
under
the
michigan
statute,
it
becomes
very
difficult,
and
because
of
the
varying
claim
of
viability
periods.
and
the
court,
the
sixth...
the
eighth
circuit
in
the
south...
in
south...
in
dealing
with
the
south
dakota
tolling
statute
concluded
that
five
years
plus
three-year
statute
of
limitations
are
not
inconsistent
with
the
federal
policy.
in
that
particular
state,
that
eighth
circuit
decided
that
eight
years
is
all
right.
but
in
deciding
that
the
eight-year
period
is
acceptable
under
the
federal
considerations,
it
did
contrast
the
eight-year
statute
they
have
with
the
open-ended
tolling
statute
similar
to
that
of
michigan,
and
conclude...
concluded
that
that
type
of
statute
is
inconsistent
with
the
federal
interest.
now,
if
the
claim
viability
period
is
extended,
the
interest
in
protecting
claims
lessens
and
the
interest
in
repose
increases.
the
reference
made
by
petitioner
to
hawkins
v.
justin
is
a
michigan
court
of
appeals
decision
wherein
they
dealt
with
the
constitutionality
of
the
tolling
statute
on
an
equal
protection
basis,
and
the
court
held
that
to
be
constitutional
under
a
rational
basis
test.
but
that
isn't
the
issue.
that's
where
the
analysis
begins.
if
it
is
constitutional,
a
reference
to
a
claim
such
as
involved
in
that
case
was
a
libel
claim
under
a
one-year
statute,
that...
that
is
fine
for...
for
the...
for
the
state's
interest.
but
under
the
1988
provision
and
under...
under
the
decision
of
tomanio,
that
has
to
be
considered
in
light
of
the
federal
interests.
and
as
i
state,
that
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
the
underlying
policies
of
deterrent
and
compensation
are
not
being
served
by
allowing
these
claims
to
languish
for
such
a
long
period
of
time
that
the
best
opportunity
for
deterrence
is
past.
now,
a
reference
is
also
made
to
the
criminal
law
context.
petitioner
analogizes
to
criminal
law
context
where...
where
the
more
serious
offenses
have
longer
statutes
of
limitation
and
murder
has
none.
but
a
similar
balance
must
be
done
in
that
case
too.
the
balancing
of
the
interest
of
repose
and
finality,
as
well
as
the
interest
in
preventing
possible
prejudice
to
defendants
to
defense,
must
be
weighed
against
society's
interesting...
interest
in
punishing
and
rehabilitating
offenders
and
deterring
other
crimes.
if
these
latter
interests
are
sufficiently
strong,
it
could
justify
longer
periods
than
in
the
civil
context,
but
even
in
the
criminal
context
in
michigan,
they
are
set
periods
of
time
and
not
the
open-ended
provisions
as
we
see
and
observe
in
the
michigan
tolling
statute.
and
i
think
that
this
comports
with
what
the
court
had
said
in
wilson
v.
garcia.
in
wilson
v.
garcia,
the
court
made
quite
a
significant
statement
with
reference
to
the
policy,
the
federal
policy
of
repose.
it
said
a
federal
cause
of
action
brought
at
any
distance
of
time
would
be
utterly
repugnant
to
the
genius
of
our
laws,
and
they
quoted
from
an
1835
case.
just
determinations
of
fact
cannot
be
made
when,
because
of
the
passage
of
time,
the
memories
of
witnesses
have
fade...
faded
or
evidence
is
lost.
in
compelling
circumstances,
even
wrongdoers
are
entitled
to
assume
their
sins
may
be
forgiven.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
xxx
take
an
example,
for--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--to
both
sides,
that's
right.
and
i
say
that
adds
to
the
burden
of
the
court
in
trying
these
cases
and...
because
the
court
duty
is
to
search
for
the
truth,
and
it
makes
it
very
difficult.
and
that's
one
of
the
bases
for
applying
a
sound
policy
of
repose.
i
think
that
if
you
would
consider,
for
example...
in
one
of
the
cases
an
example
was
given
where
a
prison
guard
make...
would
make
100
or
200
searches
in
a
period
of
six
months
to
a
year.
and
one
of
those
searches
or
two
of
those
searches,
any
one,
may
give
rise
to
a
1983
claim.
and
the
person
in...
under
the
michigan
tolling
provision
could
wait
20
or
30
years
to
bring
that
action.
and
i
think
that
that
would
unduly
burden
the
court
in
its
truth-seeking
process,
as
well
as
burden
the
defendant
in
responding
to
the
charges
that
are
made.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
well,
the
claim
may
not
be
brought...
the
claim
may
not
be
brought
at
all.
that's
very
possible,
but
that's
his
choice
not
to
bring
it
at
all.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
well,
i
think--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--i
don't
think
it's
essential.
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
do
that.
and
i
think
to
give
him
the
option
to
wait
until
he
gets
out
of
prison,
if
he
has
a
20-year
prison
sentence,
justice
scalia,
would
not
comport
or
bode
well
with
the
federal
policy
in
repose.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
pardon?
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
yes.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
pardon?
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
i
rely
on
the
decision
in
tomanio
which
calls--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--in
the
u.s....
or
the
board
of
regents
of
nyu
v.
tomanio
which
requires
a...
an
analysis
be
made
of
the
borrowed
statute
of
limitation
with
reference
to
the
federal
laws
and
federal
policies.
and
if
they're
inconsistent,
they
should
not
be
borrowed.
they
should
not
be
applied.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
and
that's
what
we're
suggesting
here.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
it
applies
to
all
cases
in
which
the
statutes
of
limitations
of
the
states
are
borrowed,
yes,
all
federal
cases.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
it
applies
to
this
case.
i
suggest--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--no,
it
does
not
put
us
out
of
court
because
i
suggest
that
the
analysis
that
must
be
made,
which
many
of
the
courts
did
not
do
in
the
cases
cited
by
petitioner,
and
that
is
make
the
analysis
to
determine
whether
the
tolling
statute
is
inconsistent
with
the...
the...
the
federal
laws
and
the
policies
of
the
federal
government.
and
one
of
those
policies
is
a
policy
of
repose.
and
the
court
has
said
many
times
they
cannot
allow
claims
to
languish
for
such
long
periods
of
time.
that
would
be
an
undue
burden
on
the
court,
as
well
as
well
as
in
the
defense,
in
seeking--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--well--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--i'm
not
having
trouble
with
that.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
i'm
not
having
trouble
with
that,
justice
marshall,
but
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
under
1988
in
a
borrowing
situation
such
as
we
have
here,
the
borrowed
statute
has
to
be
viewed
in
light
of
the
federal
law
and
federal
policies.
and
if
it
doesn't
comport
with
those
policies,
then
it
should
not
be
employed
even
though
it
is
a
state
law.
and
i--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--pardon?
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
but
1988
is
the
section
of
the
civil
rights
act
i
have
reference
to
which
requires
the
deterrence
to
be
made.
now,
as
i
say,
in
some
of
these
cases...
it
might
be
interesting
to
point
out
too
in
connection
with
the
statute
of
limitations,
and...
there
are
26
states
that
have
no
tolling
provision
for
prisoners,
and
there
are
10
states
that
have
a
limited,
fixed
tolling
provision.
there
are
14
states
that
have
tolling
provisions
open-ended
like
that
of
michigan.
what
i
suggest
here
is
that
the
court
looked
at
the
problem
realistically
and
acted
reasonably
by
limiting
the
prisoner
section
1983
claim
to
michigan's
three-year
residual
personal
injury
statute
and
ask
that
that
decision
be
affirmed.
i've
not
made
any
reference
in
my
argument
to
access
to
the
court.
access
to
the
courts
was
never
raised
in
the
court
below.
we
were
not
in
the
proceedings
at
any
point
in
the...
in
the
courts
below.
but
it
was
not
raised.
however,
it
did
appear
in
petitioner's
brief
that
there
is
a
great
disability
here.
and
i
suggest
that
that
disability
really
does
not
exist
because
since
the
decision
in
bounds
v.
smith.
and
also
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
considering
the
civil
rights
attorney
award
fee
act
of
1976
that
became
codified
into
42
u.s.c.
1988
which
this
court
said
in
hensley
v.
eckart
insures
effective
access
to
the...
to
the
judicial
process
for
persons
with
civil
rights
grievances.
certainly
in
non-frivolous
cases,
a
prisoner
should
not
have
any
difficulty
in
obtaining
the
service
of
counsel
today.
so,
that
really
is
not
an
impediment.
i
ask
that
the
court
consider
affirming
the
sixth
circuit
court
decision.
