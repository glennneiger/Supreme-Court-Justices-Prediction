mr.
caruso,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
this
same
rationale
would
support
a
federal
court's
holding
if
a
state
statute
of
limitations
ran
with,
say,
a
15-year
statute?
it
didn't
have
tolling,
but
just
had
a
15-year
statute.
do
you
think
the
federal
court
would
be
justified
in
saying
we
just
think
that's
much
too
long?
if
you're
going
to
have
effective
deterrence,
you
got
to
sue
within
three
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
you'd
say
the
court
could
under
your
theory...
could
in
effect
shorten...
if
the
state
had
said
15
years,
say,
well,
for
federal
purposes
that's
too
long.
we
want
to
shorten.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
caruso,
what
you
describe
as
a
federal
interest
in
repose--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--as
the
chief
justice
indicated,
also
could
be
described
as
a
state
interest
in
repose.
and
the
ironic
thing
about
your
argument
is
that
congress
hasn't
found
a
sufficient
interest
in
repose
even
to
draft
any
statute
of
limitations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
kind
of
hard
to
find
an
overwhelming
federal
interest
when
they
keep
letting
us
decide
all
these
questions
that
they
could
solve
for
all
of
us
in
10
minutes
by
just
adopting
a
federal
statute
of
limitations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
their
failure
to
do
so
is
a
little
hard
to
understand.
