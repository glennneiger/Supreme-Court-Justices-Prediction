we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
87-7023,
tyrone
hardin
v.
dennis
straub.
mr.
mullkoff,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
not
really
talking
about
deterring
1983
claims.
you're
talking
about--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--deterring
the
conduct
on
which
1983
claims
are
based,
aren't
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when...
mr.
mullkoff,
when
the
legislature
revisited
the
tolling
statute,
was
there
any
discussion
or
anything
in
the
reports,
if
there
are
reports
in
michigan,
that
dealt
with...
there's
a
seeming
incongruity
where
the
person
is
in
solitary
confinement
and
claims
to
be
wrongfully
there,
and
he
presumably
isn't
there
by
the
time
he
brings
his
action.
did
the
legislature
discuss
that
at
all?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mullkoff.
mr.
caruso?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
one
thinks
of
the
statute
of
limitations
analysis
though
as,
you
know,
a
long
statute
benefits
the
plaintiff
and
a
short
statute
benefits
the
defendant
generally.
and
here...
here
the
michigan...
the
state
of
michigan,
which
is
the
defendant
in
these
actions,
or
michigan
officials
who
are
defendants...
the
legislature
has
it
within
its
own
power
to...
to
change
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
caruso.
mr.
mullkoff,
do
you
have
any
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mullkoff.
the
case
is
submitted.
