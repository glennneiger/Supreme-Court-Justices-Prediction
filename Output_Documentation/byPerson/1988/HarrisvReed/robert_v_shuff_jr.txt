mr.
robert
v.
shuff,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
respondents
here
respectfully
submit
that
when
a
state
court
opinion
is
unclear
whether
it
rests
on
adequate
and
independent
state
grounds
or
the
merits
of
a
federal
constitutional
claim,
that
that
ambiguity
should
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
state
grounds,
so
that
habeas
review
is
unavailable,
absent
the
showing
of
cause
and
prejudice.
in
effect,
we're
asking
that
this
court
form
a
presumption
that
the
state
courts
have
followed
their
own
procedural
rules,
and
therefore
an
adequate
and
independent
state
grounds
exists
in
such
cases.
there
are
strong
cases,
strong
interests
of
both
the
states
and
public
which
make
this
presumption
desirable.
these
interests
are
grounded
in
constitutional
considerations,
under
our
federal
system,
the
interests
of
comity,
which
allows
us
the
fair
opportunity
to
review,
allows
us
a
degree
of
finality,
reduces
our
states'
ability
to...
i'm
sorry,
increases
our
states'
ability
to
decide
our
own
future,
and
to
bring
order
to
our
criminal
justice--
mr.
robert
v.
shuff,
jr.
--yes.
that
is
an
attendant
side
benefit.
mr.
robert
v.
shuff,
jr.
your
honor,
they
could
decide
it
on
the
state
grounds.
that
is
an
attendant...
an
attendant--
mr.
robert
v.
shuff,
jr.
--well,
it
would
not.
mr.
robert
v.
shuff,
jr.
but
if
the--
mr.
robert
v.
shuff,
jr.
--that's
correct.
you
should
assume
that
it
was
a
state
ground,
and
therefore
the
relief
on
a
habeas
proceeding--
mr.
robert
v.
shuff,
jr.
--that's
correct.
the
federal
claim
should
be
decided
that
it
is
barred.
the
respondent's
proposal
is
a
presumption
in
favor
of
the
state
courts'
following
their
rules.
finality
is
one
of
the
main
reasons
that
we
propose
this.
habeas
is
after
all
a
collateral
attack,
not
like
the
direct
appeal.
when
it's
a
collateral
attack,
it
is
already
further
removed
from
the
direct
appeal,
from
the
trial,
from
what
should
be,
as
this
court
has
stated,
the
main
event.
it
allows
the
state
to
have
order,
and
that
order
allows
us
to
punish
criminals,
and
that
that
ability
to
punish
criminals
allows
us
to
have
the
rule
of
law
and
order,
and
the
rule
of
law
and
order
allows
us
to
guarantee
the
individual
liberties
by
the
use
of
the
great
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
role
of
the
trial
cannot
be
overemphasized.
if
we
lose
or
obscure
evidence
by
a
review
after
review
after
review,
the
state's
ability
to
protect
the
integrity
of
that
trial
is
in
fact,
in
many
cases,
lost.
mr.
robert
v.
shuff,
jr.
well,
i
would
submit
that
it
would
be
ambiguous
if
it
didn't
say
"we
rely
solely
on
the
state
ground.
"
mr.
robert
v.
shuff,
jr.
in
that
instance,
your
honor,
we
would
suggest
that
the
court
assume
that
the
state
followed
its
rules
and
if
the
state
followed
its
rules
and
procedural
default
was
argued,
that
it
would
be
a
matter
of
procedural
default,
and
habeas
would
not
lie.
mr.
robert
v.
shuff,
jr.
under
that
circumstances,
you
might
have
to
make
that
second
inquiry.
mr.
robert
v.
shuff,
jr.
in
some
instances,
yes.
mr.
robert
v.
shuff,
jr.
in
that
instance,
when
it's
just
"appeal
denied",--
mr.
robert
v.
shuff,
jr.
--well--
mr.
robert
v.
shuff,
jr.
--well,
it
is
not
a,
a
useless
exercise
when
you
look
to
some
of
the
ideas
such
as
comity
and
what
the
burden
is
in
the
habeas
on
the
states.
if
you
look
at
the,
the
habeas
practice
in
illinois,
for
example,
300
cases
a
year,
you
then
think
about
how
you,
how
you
would
apply
this
rule
to
300
cases.
that
is
not
a
great
number
of
cases,
but
is
a
significant
number
of
cases,
and
the
burden
to
the
states...
you
should
look
at
it
possibly
back
that
way,
rather
than
the
burden
on
the
federal
court
looking
at
that
question.
mr.
robert
v.
shuff,
jr.
well,
the
burden
to
the
state
is
one
that
is
systemic.
the
cases,
for
example,
that
are
cited
by
the
petitioner...
in
each
one
of
those
cases,
the
illinois
court
said,
"we
have
found"...
this
is,
i'm
sorry,
this
is
in
their
reply
brief...
they
have...
"we
have
found
that
there
is
in
fact
a
default,
but
we
are
choosing
to
waive
that
default
and
go
to
the
merits.
"
that
was
a
very
small
number
of
cases.
they
have
cited
a
law
review
article
in
that
reply
brief
that
states
it
conservatively.
it's
paul
wangren,
and
it's
an
article
in
the
de
paul
law
review
that
says
conservatively
for
every
10
cases
that
the
courts
don't
find
a
waiver
and
don't
waive,
they
find
one
where
they
find
a
waiver
and,
and
i'm
sorry,
the
procedural
default,
and
do
waive.
and
so
what
you're
doing
is,
you're
putting
the
burden
back
on
the
states
to,
in
over
90
percent
of
their
cases,
to
say,
well,
we're
not
waiving,--
mr.
robert
v.
shuff,
jr.
--well,
i
believe
that
is
the--
mr.
robert
v.
shuff,
jr.
--i
believe
that
is
a
simple
rule,
but
i
don't
believe
that
it
serves
the
interest
of
comity
or
federalism
or
the
finality
rules
or
the
main
event
of
trial
or
any
other
interests
that
you
have
been
trying
to
address.
mr.
robert
v.
shuff,
jr.
well,
to
begin
with,
to
start
with
the
presumption
that
we
followed
our
rules,
and
to
give
our
courts
the
respect
of
a
co-existing
jurisdiction
to
say
that
we
believe
that
you
followed
your
rules.
that's
a
rebuttable
presumption--
mr.
robert
v.
shuff,
jr.
--that
would
be
ideal
if
they
would
all
do
that,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
v.
shuff,
jr.
no,
not
in
illinois.
primarily
they'll
be
what
we
call
a
rule
23
opinion,
which
is
an
unpublished
opinion,
very
short,
no
issues
that
are
merit
publishing
but
that
here's
what
we
decided.
mr.
robert
v.
shuff,
jr.
yes,
there
is
a
classic
case
that
i
think
would
mitigate
against
that,
and
that's
the
classic
case--
mr.
robert
v.
shuff,
jr.
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
v.
shuff,
jr.
that's
a
class
where
you
have
a
procedural
default
and
you're
talking
of
possibly
of
something
like
incompetency
of
counsel
or
misconduct
of
the
judiciary,
because
when
you
take
those
through
the
illinois
system,
you're
going
to
go
up
two
different
lines:
either
on
direct
appeal,
where
you
talk
about
a
plain
error,
or
a,
a
post
conviction
proceeding
where
you're
talking
about
a
fundamental
fairness.
and
when
you
then
come
to
the
habeas
review,
if
the
court
were
to
throw
those
cases
back,
it
would
change
the
standard
by
which
those
questions
would
be
decided.
mr.
robert
v.
shuff,
jr.
the
federal
court.
the
habeas
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
v.
shuff,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
v.
shuff,
jr.
well,
there's
a
post
conviction
direct
appeal
route,
okay,
and
there
we
have
a
rule
of
plain
error,
okay,
which
is
simply
almost
a
one,
a
one-step
rule.
and
then
we
have
a
fundamental
fairness
on
a
post
conviction
proceeding,
which
is
the
normal
place
where
matters
off
the
record
in
the
direct
appeal
would
be
brought
if
they
raise
a
constitutional
claim.
and
those
rules
are
different
than
the
rule
that
you
would
obtain
in
a
habeas
case,
if
in
fact
you
granted
the
habeas
under
the
proposed
rule.
mr.
robert
v.
shuff,
jr.
there
is
no
impossibility
that
i
could
think
of,
if
that
was
the
question.
i'm
sorry
i
misunderstood
the
question.
mr.
robert
v.
shuff,
jr.
well,
the
cause
and
prejudice
standard
that
this
court
has
set
forth
provides
an
adequate
safety
net
for
the
habeas
seeker,
so
to
speak,
the
petitioner,
in
those
cases
where
there
would
have
been
a
procedural
default,
and
yet
a
serious
constitutional
question
could
exist.
you
also
have
the
further
review
of
a,
an
extreme
miscarriage
of,
a
fundamental
miscarriage
of
justice.
so
you
have,
actually,
two
safety
nets
or
safety
valves
for
which
people
who
are
kept
from
the
habeas
system
via
presumption
of
the
state,
following
these
rules,
for
them
to
escape
into
the
habeas
system,
or
enter
the
habeas
system,
more
correctly.
so,
we
feel
that
the
individual
liberties
should
be
carefully
balanced
against
the
state's
liberties
with
the
very
fundamental
thought
in
mind
that
in
this
country,
the
states
have
the
majority
of
the
burden
of
protecting
society
from
the
criminal.
we
are
the
sentry,
and
we
feel
that
the
interests
of
comity
and
federalism
should
be
protected,
and
therefore
that
the
presumption
should
go
to
the
states.
for
those
reasons,
we
ask
you
that
you
please
affirm
the
seventh
circuit.
mr.
robert
v.
shuff,
jr.
sure.
mr.
robert
v.
shuff,
jr.
that's
approximately
numbered.
mr.
robert
v.
shuff,
jr.
i
do
not
know
how
many
go
to
evidentiary
hearing.
but
it's
a
significant
amount...
there
are
quite
a
few
that
do
go
to
evidentiary
hearing.
