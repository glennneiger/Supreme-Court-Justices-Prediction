mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
here
today
to
urge
that
the
court
apply
the
plain
statement
rule
of
michigan
v.
long
to
federal
habeas
review
of
state
court
convictions
under
28
usc
sec.
2254.
i
suggest
that
if
a
state
court
plainly
relies
on
a
procedural
default,
then
federal
habeas
review
should
ordinarily
be
foreclosed,
absent
cause
and
prejudice.
on
the
other
hand,
if,
as
in
this
case,
the
state
court
is
ambiguous
or
obscure
concerning
whether
it
relied
on
the
procedural
default,
then
i
suggest
that
that
ambiguity
should
be
resolved
in
favor
of
preserving
the
federal
issue
for
habeas
review.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
well,
this
court
has
said
on
several
occasions
that
merely
noting
a
procedural
default
is
not
the
same
as
actually
relying
on
the
procedural
default.
oftentimes
state
courts...
and
indeed,
in
illinois,
the
state
court
will
note
a
procedural
default
but
then
go
on
to
excuse
it,
and
consider
and
dispose
of
the
case
on
the
merit.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
yes.
my
view
is
that
absent
a
plain
statement
clearly
invoking
the
procedural
default,
as
opposed
to
merely
noting
it,
that
absent
a
plain
statement
invoking
the
default
and
finding
the
issue
waived,
then
the
federal
issue
that's
been
discussed
by
the
appellate
court
ought
to
be
preserved
for
review
by
the--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--oh,
no.
in
order
to...
the
rule
would
be
the
same
as
this
court
has
articulated
in
michigan
v.
long,
and
also
in
the
context
of
a
procedural
default
that
caldwell
v.
mississippi.
if
the
state
court
plainly
relies
on
a
procedural
default,
then
that
would
foreclose--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--no,
not
necessarily
alone.
if
they...
yes.
if
they
do
that,
then
federal
habeas
review
is
foreclosed
absent
cause
and
prejudice,
even
if
they
go
on
to
discuss
the
federal
issue
in
dicta.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
that
is--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--well,
that's
the
circumstances
that
arises
occasionally
where
you
have
alternative
reliance.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
and
in
that
instance,
habeas...
the
sykes
test
would
apply,
habeas
review
would
be
foreclosed
absent
cause
and
prejudice.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
well,
michigan
v.
long,
of
course,
is
a
direct
review
case,
your
honor.
and
the
rule
has--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--that
is
the
rule
in
michigan
v.
long,
your
honor,
as
i
understand
it.
it's
also
applied
in
caldwell
v.
mississippi,
that
if
the
state
court,
if
the
highest
court
of
the
state
plainly
relies
on
a
procedural
default,
then
that
will
preclude
direct
review
by
the
supreme
court,
regardless
of
whether
the
state
court
also
discusses
the
merits
of
a
federal
issue.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
it
noted
the
procedural
default,
but
instead
of
invoking
the
default
and
finding
the
issue
waived,
your
honor,
the
court
went
on
to
address
the
merits
of
mr.
harris'
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
well,
any
number
of
ways,
but
i
suggest
that
the
same
rules
that
would
govern
in
michigan
v.
long
would
govern
here,
and
there
the
court
has,
has
said
that
a
simple
statement
that
the
court
finds
a
matter
waived
or
barred
because
of
procedural
default
would
suffice.
the
court
said
that
that
claims
statement
rule
would
serve
interests
of
comity
and
uniformity
and
in
the
systemic
interests,
and
i
suggest
that
all
of
those
policy
considerations
are
equally
well-served
here
in
the
context
of
habeas
review.
the
plain
statement
rule
would
afford
due
respect
to
a
decision
by
a
state
court
to
plainly
invoke
its
procedural
rules.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
i'm
sorry?
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
precisely
your
honor,
and
for
all
of
the
good
reasons
that
were
articulated
in
michigan
v.
long.
this
ad
hoc
method
of
guessing
at,
at
what
the
appellate
court
meant
lends
itself
to
error.
it
disserves
the
comity
interest,
and
i
think
the--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--yes.
sometimes
it--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--sometimes
this
issue
does
arise
in
the
context
of
summary--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--affirmants.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
well--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--yeah.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
well,
the
plain
statement
rule
should
be
applied
in
the
context
of
summary
affirmances,
because
here's
the
danger
that's
going
to
arise
if
you
don't.
you
have
a
case
where
the
procedural
default
is,
is,
let's
say,
questionable,
both
as
a
matter
of
state
law
and
as
the
facts.
you
also
have
an
arguable
constitutional
issue.
the
prosecutor
argues
on
appeal
that
the,
makes
a
very
weak
claim
that
the
procedural
default
should
be
invoked.
the
defendant
argues
on
appeal
that
his
strong
constitutional
error
ought
to
be
reviewed,
and
then
the
appellate
court
just
summarily
affirms
without
a
decision.
the
danger
of
not
applying
the
plain
statement
rule
in
that
context
is
that
the
state
court,
you
may
be
in
one
of
those
states
like
illinois
where
procedural
defaults
are
excused,
and
here
we've
got
a
busy
court
that
has
not
taken
the
time
to
articulate
its
real
intent.
it...
its
real
intent
may
be
to
excuse
the,
the
procedural
default,
because
that's
a
weaker
questionable
argument,
and
rely
on
the
merits.
if
that
happened,
and
the
federal...
and
then
the
plain
statement
rule
is
not
applied,
the
federal
court
runs
the
risk
of
guessing
incorrectly
about
the
meaning
or
the
intent
of
the
state
court.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
and
that
kind
of--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--well,
if
leave
to
appeal
is
denied,
then
there,
then
there's
really...
it's
like
denial
of
certiorari.
there's
really
been
no
opinion.
so
i
think
then
you
would
look
at
the
appellate
court
decision--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--yes,
and
you'd
look
to
see
whether
the
appellate
court
had
plainly
relied
on
the
procedural
default.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
well,
in
fairness,
that
is
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
decision,
but
i
would
point
out
that
reasonable
minds
have
disagreed
all
the
way
up
through
here.
we've
had
four
federal
judges
below
who
have
disagreed
concerning
the
meaning
of
the
decision.
as
you
know,
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
appellate
court
had
intended
to
excuse
the
waiver
issue,
because
the
appellate
court
discusses
not
only
the
alibi
witness
issue,
but
also
some
of
the
other
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim
issues
that
mr.
harris
had
raised.
two
judges
in
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
also
said
that
the
order
was
ambiguous,
but
they...
and
then
they
tried
to
ascertain
the
intent
of
the
court,
and
they
disagreed
with
the
district
court.
and
then
we
have
judge
cudahy,
who
wrote
a
concurring
opinion,
and
he
said:
gee,
the
order
is
ambiguous,
and
i
don't
think
we
ought
to
be
trying
to
divine
the
unspoken
intent.
so
i
think
that
the,
the
best
evidence,
really,
that
this,
that
this
order
is
a
good
candidate
for
the
plain
statement
rule
is
the
fact
that
we've
now
had
four
lower
judges
below
who
have
been
unable
to
agree
at
the
meaning
of
it.
and
of
course
the
parties--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--have
spent
a
lot
of
time
briefing
it
as
well.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
well,
the
plain
statement
rule
certainly
is
not
going
to
preclude
the
state
courts
from
invoking
or
applying
a
procedural
rule.
so,
all
the
plain
statement
rule
really
does
is
provide
the
lower
federal
courts
with
guidance
concerning
whether
or
not
to
afford
habeas
review
when
the
state
courts
have
been
obscure.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
i
think
that,
your
honor,
in
the
context
of
habeas
review,
the
court
has
noted
that
its
jurisdiction
is
really
broader
than
on
direct
review,
and
i
think
you
also
have
to
keep
in
mind
the
historic
office
of
the
great
writ
here,
in
that
it
is
the
ultimate
protection
against
un-constitutional
detention,
and
this
court
has
noted
that
a
procedural
default
does
not
bar
a
habeas
court
from,
from
exercising
jurisdiction
and,
and
affording
review.
so
i
think
that
all
of
the
reasons
that
your
honor
articulated
in
michigan
v.
long
apply
with
equal,
if
not
greater,
force
here
in
the
habeas
context,
in
terms
of
promoting
uniformity,
in
terms
of
promoting
comity,
and
protecting
the
systemic
interests
that
were
articulated
in
wainwright.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
well,
as
justice
rehnquist
wrote
in
wainwright
v.
sykes,
comity
interest
would
ordinarily
preclude
a
court
from
affording
habeas
review
if
there
has
been
an
adequate
and
independent
state
grounds
for
the
state
court's
decision.
and
that
rule
was
explained
in
terms
of
affording
proper
due
respect
for
the
decision
of
the
state
courts
to
enforce
their
procedural
rules.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
it
is
a
court
made
consideration.
i'm
sure
your
honor
is
familiar
with
the
history
of
it.
in
fay
v.
noia,
the
court
said
that
absent
a
deliberate
bypass,
federal
habeas
review
would
be
allowed.
and
then
we
have
the
daniels
v.
united
states
and
fay
v.
henderson,
which
began
developing
this
cause
and
prejudice
test,
and
then
the
court
finally
adopted
the
cause
and
prejudice
test
in
wainwright
v.
sykes,
emphasizing
the,
the
systemic
interest
of
finality
and
efficiency
and
the
comity
interests
of--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--well,
for
all
of
the
reasons
that
we
discussed.
in
part
because
if
you
have,
if
you
have
a
presumption
in
favor
of
default,
for
example,
you
are
not
going
to
give
the
appropriate,
the
respect
that
is
due
when,
for
example,
a
state
court
without
being
clear
decides
not
to
apply
its
procedural
rules.
when
a
state
court
decides
not
to
invoke
its
procedural
rules,
and
instead
to
reach
the
merits
of
a
federal
issue,
it
has
necessarily
made
a
determination
that
the
policies
underpinning
its
procedural
rules
aren't
worthy
of
indication
in
that
particular
case.
and
a
federal
court,
i
think,
ought
to
give
proper
respect
for
that
determination
as
well
as
the
determination
to
invoke
the
rules
where
appropriate.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
that's
the
problem.
you
don't
know,
and
the
danger--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--the
danger
with
the--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--notes
it
and
goes
on
to
address
merit.
so
you
don't
know--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--in
our
instance
what
they
intended.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
maybe,
but
maybe
they
thought
that
their
procedures...
the
policies
underpinning
their
procedural
rules
didn't
merit
the
vindication
given
the
important
issues
in
this
case,
and
the
importance
of
this
particular
issue
to
this
particular
defendant.
you
don't
know,
and
the
danger
of
presuming
in
favor
of
default
is
that
you're
going
to
guess
wrong,
and
the
danger--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--no,
i
haven't
said
that
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
not
here
today
or
on
the
briefs.
i
said
that
if
the
state
court
plainly
relies
on
the
procedural
default
as
the
basis
for
its
decision--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--correct.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
that's
right.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
that's
right--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--which,
as
this
court
said
in
michigan
v.
long,
was
not
a
good
procedure.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
yes,
but
there
are
going
to
be
instances
where
the
state
court
hasn't
told
you,
they've
been
obscure
as
to
the
whether
or
not
there
is
a
procedural
default,
either
legally
or
factually
in
the
context,
and
the
danger
of
presuming
in
favor
of
default
in
those
instances,
as
i
said,
is
that
important
individual
rights
may
be
lost
simply
because
the
state
court
judge
was
obscure
about
his
intent.
and
i
think
when
you're
dealing
with
individual
liberty,
that
kind
of
ambiguity
or
obscurity
just
should
not
be
tolerated,
should
not
block
federal
review
of
the
habeas
issue.
and
i
think
that
this
court...
if
you
look
at
the
court's
decisions
in
this
area
over
the
years,
you've
seen
the
rule
developed
in
the
direct
review
cases,
of
about
the
plain
statement
rule,
but
you've
also
seen
the
rule
develop
in
the
habeas
cases
that
if
the
state
court
has
disposed
of
the
federal
issue,
then
the
federal
courts
have
an
unflagging
duty
to
resolve
or
to
review
the
correctness
of
the
state
court's
decision
on
the
federal
issue.
going
back,
way
back
to
brown
v.
allen...
brown
v.
allen
said
that
if
there's
an
adequate
and
independent
state
grounds,
then
habeas
review
is
going
to
be
foreclosed.
but
they
went
on
to
give
some
exceptions
to
that,
and
one
of
those
exceptions
is
right
on
point
here.
in
brown
v.
allen,
they
said,
well,
if
the
state
court
indicates
that
state
collateral
review
is
permissible
despite
a
procedural
default,
then
the
federal
court
can
afford
habeas
review
of
the
federal
issue
that
has
been
disposed
of
by
the
state
court
in
the
state
collateral
proceeding.
that's
really
what
we
have
here.
we
have,
we
have
a
situation
where
the
state
court
indicated
that
state
collateral
review
may
be
permissible.
the
circuit
court
disposed
of
mr.
harris'
ineffective
assistance
claim
on
the
merits,
and
then
we
get
up
in
the
appellate
court
and
we're
really
not
sure
what
they
did
with
it,
but
they
at
least
talked
about
it,
discussed
it,
and
concluded
in
their...
at
the
end
of
their
order,
that
his
petition
is
denied,
based
on
their
review
of
the
entire
record.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
i
don't
think
it
has
a
significance,
because
i
would
call
your
honors'
attention
to
the
fact
that
that
michigan...
although
that
was
the
context
of
michigan
v.
long,
that
plain
statement
rule
has
been
applied
subsequently
in
a
procedural
default
case,
in
caldwell
v.
mississippi,
where
the
defendant
failed
to,
failed
to
raise
his
constitutional
issue
on
appeal,
and
his
conviction
was
affirmed.
and
then
it
went
to
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
which
raised
the
issue
sua
sponte,
split
four
to
four
over
it,
and
then
it
went
to
this
court
on
certiorari,
and
i,
i
think
justice
marshall
was
writing
for
the
majority.
he
made
it
very
clear
there
that
the
mere
existence
of
a
procedural
bar
is
not
going
to
foreclose
this
court's
direct
review
jurisdiction.
on
the
contrary,
the
state
court
actually
had
to
have
relied
upon
the
procedural
bar
before
this
court
will
decline
jurisdiction.
so
i
think,
your
honor
is
right.
that
was
the
context
of
michigan
v.
long.
but
i
think
it
is,
it's
gone
the
other
way
in
subsequent
cases.
so
i
don't
think
the
distinction
is
important.
i
do
think
that
all
of
the
reasons
for
the
application
of
the
plain
statement
rule
in
the
context
of
direct
review
apply
equally
well
in
the
habeas
context,
in
the
context
of
habeas
review.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
that's
true.
the
defendant
had--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--defaulted--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--i'm
not
following
you
there,
your
honor.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
as
i
recall,
the
court
in
caldwell
said
that
the
reference
to
the
waiver
issue
in
the
prevailing
opinion
is
somewhat
cryptic,
but
then
went
on
to
note
that
the
michigan
supreme
court
had
requested
briefs
on
the
constitutional
issue,
had
requested
oral
argument,
and
had
in
fact
attempted
to
decide
it,
four
to
four.
so
i
can't
agree
with
your
honor
that
the
decision
was
crystal
clear,
because
justice
marshall
did
note
that
the
mississippi
supreme
court
had
referred
to
the
waiver
issue,
and
that
the
court's
reference,
as
he
put
it,
was
"somewhat
cryptic".
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
well,
i
have
urged
in
my
briefs,
and
here
today,
that
you
don't
adopt
that
presumption
because
that
presumption
is
contrary
to
the
rationale
set
forth
in
michigan
v.
long,
and
it
also
runs
the
risk
that
the
federal
district
court
is
simply
going
to
guess
wrong
at
the
meaning
of
the
state
court,
and
fundamental
rights
will
be
lost
simply
because
the
state
court's
opinion
was
obscured.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
i
have
no--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--oh,
no.
oh,
no.
i
have
no
quarrel
with
that
as
a
general
proposition,
your
honor.
illinois
state,
illinois
state
courts
as
a
general
rule
do
invoke
their
procedural
default
rules.
but
there
are
instances
where
they
also
excuse
them,
and
you
see
the
most
frequent,
that
arises
most
frequently
in
the
context
that
we're
here
today
in,
namely,
cases
under
our
illinois
post-conviction
hearing
act.
if,
if
you
look
at
our
reply
brief,
we
list
a
number
of
cases
where
cases
arising
under
the
illinois
post-conviction
act
have
excused
a
procedural
default,
particularly
when,
when
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
is
at
issue.
and
all
i'm
saying
is,
if
the,
if
the
state
court
want's
to
foreclose
federal
review,
all
they
have
to
do
is
plainly
rely
on
and
invoke
the
procedural
default.
on
the
other
hand,
if
they're
going
to
be
ambiguous
about
it,
then
in
order
to
preserve
the
vitality
of
the
great
writ,
and
to
protect
the
comity
and
systemic
interests,
you've
got
to
preserve
the
federal
issue
for
review
by
the
federal
court.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
it's--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--well,
you
just
can't
tell,
and
when
you
can't
tell,
all
of
the
policy
reasons
we've
discussed,
i
think,
in
the
context
of
habeas,
even
more
so
than
direct-review
compel
preservation
of
the
federal
issue
for
federal
review.
i'm
not
saying
you
have
to
make
an
inference
one
way
or
the
other.
in
some
cases,
you'll
be
able
to
make
an
inference.
some
cases
you
won't.
in
this
case,
there
are
several
reasonable
inferences
that
you
can
make
from
the
order,
but
it
still
boils
down
to
the
fact
that
you're
guessing
at
what
the
appellate
court
really
intended
to
do.
and
i'm
saying
when
you're
guessing
in
the
context
of
individual
liberty,
it's...
it's
a
dangerous
game
to
play,
and
it's
the
wrong
game
to
play.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
oh,
no--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--absolutely.
they
were
clearly
aware
of
the
procedural
default.
they
noted
it.
i
agree
with
your
honor
entirely.
i...
with
your
honor's
permission,
i
think
i'll
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
my
opponent
argues
that
there
should
be
a
presumption
that
the
state
courts
have
followed
their
procedural
rules.
i
certainly
don't
have
any
quarrel
with
that,
but
the
presumption
should
recognize
that
the
state
courts,
in
following
their
procedural
rules,
sometimes
invoke
procedural
default
and
sometimes
excuse
it.
i
think
the
plain
statement
rule
would
recognize
that
fact.
my
opponents
also
argue
that
there
should
be
a
presumption
in
procedural
default
whenever
there's
ambiguity.
and
i
would
remind
my
opponent
that
that
very
presumption
in
favor
of
dismissal
has
been
rejected
by
this
court
in
the
context
of
direct
review
in
the
michigan
v.
long
case.
there,
the
court
said
that
it
would
not
dismiss
the
case
outright
if
the
state
court
had
been
ambiguous
or
obscure
concerning
whether
it
relied
on
an
adequate
and
independent
state
ground.
on
the
contrary,
the
court
there
said
that
it
would
presume
in
those
instances
that
the
court
had
disposed
of
the
issue
on
the
federal
issue.
and
now
my
opponents
are
arguing
basically
for
the
reverse
presumption
in
the
context
of
habeas
review,
but
have
identified
no
good
reasons
that
i've
heard
here
today--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--i'm
not,
i'm
not
sure
i'm
following
the
gist
of
your
question,
your
honor.
if--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--if--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--well,
i
think
that...
i
think
that's
settled,
your
honor,
and
that
was...
that
was,
that
was
settled
in
the
county
court
of
ulster
case,
and
also--
mr.
kimball
r.
anderson
--that's
right.
it's
not...
it
cannot
be
raised
in
the
first
instance
in
the
federal
court,
because
the
state
court
didn't
give
any
indication
that,
that
its
review
of
the
federal
issue
was
barred
because
of
the
procedural
default,
and
i
think
justice
stevens
said
in
county
court
of
ulster
that
if
a
state
court
doesn't
indicate
that,
that
review
of
the
federal
issue
is
precluded
by
the
state's
procedural
bar,
then
the
federal
court
certainly
implies
no
disrespect
for
the
state
courts
by
entertaining
the
issue.
my
opponents
also
say
that
the
cause
and
prejudice
rule
provides
some
kind
of
safety
net
here,
but
the
cause
and
prejudice
test
was
never
intended
as
a
safety
net
for
obscure
state
court
opinions.
there
is
certainly
no
authority
for
that
proposition.
in
wainwright
v.
sykes,
the
court
didn't
charge
ahead
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
cause
and
prejudice.
instead,
they
first,
the
court
first
addressed
in
detail
whether
or
not
there
was
in
fact
an
adequate
and
independent
state
grounds
for
the
state
court
decision.
you
don't
just
jump
over
that
and
rely
on
the,
rely
on
the,
rely
on
the
cause
of
prejudice
test
as
some
kind
of
safety
net
here.
finally,
i
think
that
maybe
i
should
conclude
with
an
analogy
to
a
baseball
rule,
since
i
know
noted
the
court's
reliance
on
baseball
precedent
this
morning,
and
since
we
are
approaching
the
seventh
game
of
the
national
league
series
tonight.
it's
settled
in
baseball
that
a
tie
between
the
runner
and
the
ball
goes
to
the
runner.
i
think
it's
equally
settled
in
the
context
of
direct
review
that
a
tie
between
the
procedural
default
and
the
federal
issue
goes
to
the
federal
issue.
and
now,
i
think,
what
we
have
here
is
the
state
is
trying
to
change
the
rules
of
the
ball
game
just
because
we're
here
on
habeas
review
instead
of
direct
review.
and
as
i've
said
today
and
in
our
briefs,
there
really
isn't
any
different...
there
isn't
any
good
reason
to
treat
ambiguity
in
the
context
of
direct
review
any
differently
than
in
habeas
review.
and
i
thank
your
honors
very
much.
