justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
the
caldwell
case,
we
found
that
the
state
court's
ruling
was
not
ambiguous,
and
that
they
had
not
invoked
the
procedural
bar.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so
the
inference,
that,
or
the
language
in
the
opinion
that
procedural
bars
are
treated
the
same
way
as
state
substantive
grounds
was
really
unnecessary
to
that
decision?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
caldwell,
we
found
that
the
state
supreme
court's
order
was
clear,
and
that
it
had
not
relied
on
the
state
procedural
ground.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
assuming
that
we
made
a
clear
holding,
that
procedural
grounds
are
subject
to
the
michigan
long,
v.
long
rule
in
direct
review
cases,
if
we
apply
it
in
the
context
of
a
habeas
proceeding,
i
assume
that
in
most
of
the
cases
such
as
justice
scalia
puts,
where
there
is
simply
a
one-line
order
affirmed,
we
won't
need
cause
and
prejudice
anymore
because
we
simply
rely
on
a
presumption
that
procedural
bar
was
not
invoked?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
mention
the
illinois
practice,
really
as
an
empirical
matter.
i
should
think
that
most
state
courts
respect
their
procedural
bar
rules.
they're
designed
to
tell
the
state
courts
that
these
are
not
litigatible
issues--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
you're
asking
us
to
presume
the
opposite.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
is
not...
or
is
it
based
on
an
inference
that
the
state
court
probably
did
ignore
the
procedural
bar?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
is
that
just
irrelevant,
as
far
as
you're
concerned?
