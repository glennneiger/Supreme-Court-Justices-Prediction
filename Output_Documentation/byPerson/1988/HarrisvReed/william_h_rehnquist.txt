we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
87-5677,
warren
lee
harris
v.
marvin
reed.
mr.
anderson,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
anderson--
--do
you
think
that...
excuse
me.
mr.
anderson,
if
the
state
court
opinion
says
there
has
been
a
procedural
default
here
and
we
need
not
reach
this
question,
nonetheless,
you
know,
for
guidance,
or
whatever,
then
they
go
ahead
and
express
an
opinion
on
it...
how
does
that
come
out
under
your
rule?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
is
your
view,
as
to
how
this
ought
to
be
handled
too?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
in
order
to
rely
on
procedural
default,
the
state
court
opinion
must
say
nothing
about
the
merits
of
the
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
alone.
but...
okay.
so--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
caldwell
would
obtain
reversal
for
you
here,
because
the
illinois
appellate
court
did
not
say
anything
about
procedural
default
in
its
opinion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
does
a
court
invoke
the
procedural
default
in
its
opinion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--how
about
the
second
part
of
justice
scalia's
[inaudible],
maybe
you're
coming
to
that,
the
illinois
appellate
court
rests
its
decisions
solely
on
procedural
fault,
appeal
to,
leave
to
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
denied
without
opinion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
anderson.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
shuff.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what,
as
a
practical
matter,
is
the
burden
to
the
states
of
the
rule
that
the
petitioner
proposes?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
anything
that
concerns
you
from
the
point
of
your
representing
the
state
by
your
opponent's
rule,
other
than
the
fact
that
the
court
would
have
to
say,
"we
find
a
procedural
default
here.
"
when
perhaps
they
would
prefer
not
to?
are
there
any
class
of
cases
that
haven't
been
explored
in
the
argument
or
on
the
briefs?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
nullicate
against
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
what
court
were
to
throw
the--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
don't...
perhaps
i
don't
understand
enough
about
illinois
law.
i
don't...
i
really
don't
understand
exactly
what
you're
saying.
there
are
two
different
post-conviction
routes
in
illinois?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
that
was
the
question.
you've
answered
either
one
question
or
two.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
anderson.
the
case
is
submitted.
