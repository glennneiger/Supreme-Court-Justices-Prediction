justice
byron
r.
white
--okay.
so
if
the
court
says,
we
have
two
reasons
here
for
decision:
one,
a
procedural
default,
two,
you
haven't
got
anything
on
the
merits
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there's
no
question
if
they
say
they
are
relying
on
the
procedural
default.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
quite
michigan
v.
long,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
but
you
say
you're...
you
want
the
michigan
v.
long
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
that
it
ought
to
be
the
plain
statement
by
the
appellate
court,
the
federal
court
shouldn't
try
to
imagine
whether
they
relied
on
it
or
not?
they
should
say,
they
should,
just
an
objective
test--
justice
byron
r.
white
--[inaudible]
the
opinion
of
the
appellate
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
what...
what
is,
on
what
basis
does
a
federal
court
refuse
habeas
corpus
when
there's
been
a
procedural
default
that
the
state
court
relies
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
is
a,
this
is
a
court
made
consideration,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
federal
habeas
is
really,
as
has
been
suggested,
is
a
different
kettle
of
fish
than
a
directed
review,
i
suppose?
why
shouldn't
there
be
a
presumption
in
favor
of
the,
in
an
ambiguous
situation,
a
presumption
in
favor
of
the
state
grounds?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
the
ambiguous
case,
the
state
court
hasn't
said
that.
the
state
court
is,
how
do
you
know
whether
they
relied
on
it
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
at
least,
at
least
the
state
court
notes
the
procedural
default.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they--
justice
byron
r.
white
--they
just
want
lawyers
to
know
what
the
federal
rule
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
argument,
your
argument
now
sounds
like
even
if
the
state
court
relies
solely
on
procedural
default
in
a
particular
case,
the
habeas,
the
habeas
corpus
court
should
sit
and
entertain
the
claim
if
it
finds
that
there
has
been
an
uneven
application
of
procedural
default.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
regardless
of
whether
it
does
it
every
day
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
we
usually
rely
on
the
court
of
appeals
judges
to
tell
us
what
state
law
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
also
would
save
the
federal
courts
from
some
work,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
from
going
through
a
useless
procedure,
which
because
it
may
be
it
goes
back
to
the
state
court
and
they
decide
it
on
the
state
grounds.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
there's
ambiguity,
you
say
you
should
assume
that
it's
a
state
ground.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
never...
you
never
decide
the
federal
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it,
i
take
it
then
that
your
position,
the
state
would
never
be
able
to,
should
never
be
allowed
to
raise
procedural
default
in
the
first
instance
in
the
federal
habeas
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there,
no
claim
of
procedural
default
was
ever
made
in
the
state
courts--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
the
state
court
simply
decided
the
federal
issue,
and
the
state
comes
into
the
federal
habeas
court
saying
procedural
default.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
answer
is
the
state
may
not
raise
it
in
the
first
instance?
