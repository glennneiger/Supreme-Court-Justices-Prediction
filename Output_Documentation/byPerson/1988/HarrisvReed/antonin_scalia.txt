justice
antonin
scalia
it
makes
a
lot
of
sense
where
you
have
a
written
appellate
court
decision,
but
what
do
you
do,
i
mean,
a
lot
of
state
appellate
courts
that,
that
have
mandatory
appeals
don't
write
full
opinions.
in
most
of
them,
they
just
say
"appeal
denied".
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
you
have--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right.
and
suppose
you
have
a
lower
court
opinion
that
rested
its
decision
on
procedural
default.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
all
that
the
appellate
court
says
is
appeal
denied.
justice
antonin
scalia
what,
what
obtains
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
part
of
the
problem
with
adopting
an
ambiguity
rule?
it's
not
a
clear
line
rule.
i'm
helping
you...
don't...
i
mean,
if
you
could
tell
me
how
that
could
be
a
clear
line
rule,
i'll
be
happy
to
rule
against
you.
but
you
don't
know
whether
it's
ambiguous
until
you
inquire
into
state
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
to
inquire
into
what
the
state
law
procedure
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
really
don't
know
that
there's
an
ambiguity
until
you've
made
the
federal
habeas
court
conduct
an
inquiry
into
state
procedural
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
shuff,
i'm...
i
happen
to
think
that
the
silliest
thing
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
litigating
about,
and
for
judges
to
have
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
inquiring
into,
is,
is
whether
they
have
jurisdiction,
that
the
jurisdictional
issues
ought
to
be
clear.
now,
mr.
anderson
has
given
us
a
clear
line.
you
can
tell
right
away...
you
look
at
the
opinion
of
the
state
court.
if
it
says,
either
as
an
alternative
holding
or
as,
as
a
sole
holding,
"we
rely
on
the
procedural
default.
"
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
if
it
doesn't
say
that,
there's
federal
jurisdiction;
if
it
does
say
it
there
isn't.
what
clear
line
do
you
give
us?
you
say
where
it's
ambiguous.
how
do
i
know
when
it's
ambiguous?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
have
anything
except
a
court
of
appeals,
a
state
court
of
appeals
order
that
says:
affirmed.
that's
all
i
have.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'd
have
to
look
to
see
whether
procedural
default
was
argued?
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i'd
also
have
to
make
a
ruling
on
whether
the
argument
was
a
right
one,
i
suppose.
i'd
have
to
figure
out
what
the
state
law
is
about
procedural
default,
wouldn't
i,
as
a
federal
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
going
to
be
a
very
common
instance.
that's
going
to
be
a
very
common
instance.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
just
don't
consider
that
a
very
clear
line.
i
don't
like
to...
to,
you
know,
i'd
much
rather
have
federal
judges
figuring
out
what
federal
law
is,
than
figuring
out
what
the
state
procedural
law
is.
that
seems
to
me
an
utterly
useless
exercise
for
federal
judges
to
engage
in.
justice
antonin
scalia
big
deal.
all
they
have
to
do
is
say
by
the
way,
we're
relying
on
procedural
default
when
they
are.
that's
all
they
have
to
say.
we
are
relying
on
procedural
default.
you
could
even
summarize
it.
you
could
say
procedural
default.
you
say,
is
that
such
a
terrible
burden
on
the
states?
whenever
they
say
that,
the
federal
court
is
out
of
it.
if
they
don't
say
it,
the
federal
court
isn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
quick
and
easy,
no
trouble
for
everybody.
justice
antonin
scalia
instead
of
that,
you
want
to
have
the
federal
judges
enter
into
this,
this
inquiry,
for
no
useful
federal
purpose
at
all,
into
what
the
state
law
of
procedural
default
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
can't
they
give
us
some
respect,
and
just,
some
respect,
and
just
say
procedural
default
when
that,
when
that's
what
they're
relying
on?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
see?
makes
sense
to
me.
well,
what
are
the
circumstances
when
they
don't
do
it,
in
these
300
cases?
we're
not
just
talking
about
the
whole
world,
300
cases
going
through
the
illinois
court
of
appeals.
are
a
lot
of
them
affirmances
of
trial
courts
without
opinion?
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
what
difference
does
that...
i
think
the
chief
justice's
question
is,
is
not
going
to
the,
to
that
point,
the
effect
of
a
habeas
decision.
it's
going
to
the
question
of
whether
there's
some
category
of
case
where
it
would
be
difficult
or
impossible
for
the
state
court
to
say
"procedural
default".
is
there
any?
