justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
anderson,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
reliance
on
michigan
v.
long?
generally
speaking,
not
exclusively,
the
michigan
v.
long
line
of
cases
deal
with
situations
in
which
the
state
is
contending
that
the
state
courts
have
given
more
protection
to
a
federal
constitutional
claim
than
the
constitution
actually
warrants.
in
the
habeas
situation,
it's
the
exact
reverse.
typically
the
defendant
is
claiming
that
he
was
deprived
of
protection
the
constitution
would
provide
him.
do
you
think
that
distinction
has
any
significance
and
which
way
does
it
cut?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
mr.
anderson,
speaking
of
the
illinois
practice,
it
wouldn't
be
a
matter
of
presuming
that
they've
ignored
the
bar,
but
rather
because
of
the
broad
exception
in
the
illinois
post
conviction
act
for
a
case
of
fundamental
unfairness,
that
they
think
there's
enough
substance
to
the
claim
alleged
in
the
petition
that
they
are
concerned
that
it
might
meet
that
test,
and
in
the
case
of
doubt,
they
go
ahead
and
decide
it
on
the
merit.
but
i
don't
think
it's...
you're
really
arguing
they
were
simply
unaware
of
the
procedural
bar?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
just
don't
think
it
might
apply,
given
the
allegations
of
federal
constitutional
violations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
understand
that.
they
can...
after
the
federal
habeas
court
decides
that
there's
merit
to
the
case,
and
orders
a
retrial,
how
would
it
go
back
to
the
state
system
to
reargue
the
state
procedural
bar?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
not?
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
shuff,
before
you
sit
down,
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
said
there
are
about
300
habeas
cases
in
illinois
every
year,
is
that
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--how
many
of
those
go
to
hearing,
are
there
evidentiary
hearings
in
them,
would
you
say?
do
you...
maybe,
i
mean,
if
you
do
know?
