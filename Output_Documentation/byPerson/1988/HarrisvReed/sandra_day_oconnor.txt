justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
anderson,
in
this
case,
the
illinois
court
said
that,
except
for
the
alibi
witnesses,
all
the
matters
raised
in
the
petitioner's
ineffectiveness
claim
could
have
been
raised
on
direct
appeal.
and
then
it
went
on,
and
dealt
with,
on
the
merits,
the
alibi
witness
question.
now,
in
all
fairness,
shouldn't
that
be
read
as,
as
procedurally
barring
everything
but
the
alibi
witnesses?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
maybe--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--maybe
on
federal
habeas,
our
federalism
concerns
are
somewhat
greater
than
on
direct
review,
so
that
we
could
give
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
to
the
state's
position
of,
of
procedural
bar.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
are
the
considerations
on
federal
habeas
any
different
at
all
than
on
direct
review,
do
you
think?
i
mean,
should
we
be
less
eager
for
the
federal
courts
to
reach
out
and
decide
these
cases?
