mr.
michael
douglas
white
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
wyoming
supreme
court
which
the
state
contends
erroneously
quantified
the
federal
reserved
water
right
for
the
wind
river
indian
reservation.
the
specific
question
before
the
court
is
whether
the
practically
irrigable
acreage
standard,
or
pia
standard,
for
the
quantification
of
the
employed
federal
right
was
properly
applied
below
where
there
were
state
water
rights
congressionally
mandated
and
acquired
for
the
reservation
and
where
there
was
no
need
shown
for
an
additional
water
right
as
a
reserved
right.
the
general
question--
mr.
michael
douglas
white
--yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
douglas
white
it
is.
mr.
michael
douglas
white
and
the
more
general
question
that
is
before
the
court,
and
the
one
that
has
drawn
so
much
attention
from
the
amici
is
the
applicability,
the
universal
applicability
of
the
pia
quantification...
standard
to
all
reservations
other
than
those
in
arizona
i.
after
briefly
describing
the
facts
of
our
case,
i
would
like
to
explain
why
the
wyoming
court
should
be
reversed.
if
you
have
before
you
the
cert
petition
itself,
and
the
last
page
of
that
petition
is
a
fold-out
map
showing
the
reservation.
and
following
along
with
that,
let
me
make
my
explanation
clear.
the
reservation
itself
is
located
in
northwestern
wyoming.
it's
about
45
miles
southeast
of
yellowstone
national
park
and
little
small
river
in
yellowstone
national
park.
the
boundaries
that
you
see
on
that
map
are
about
60
miles
from
east
to
west
and
about
50
miles
from
north
to
south.
the
reservation
itself
was
set
aside
by
treaty
with
the
shoshone
in
1868.
there
were
approximately
2,400
indians
that
are
part
of
a
band
of
shoshone
that
were
living
to
the
west
of
the
present
reservation
site.
ten
years
later,
in
1878,
the
arapaho
were
forcibly
placed
on
the
reservation,
to
which
the
shoshone
strenuously
objected
and
for
which
they
received
compensation
in
the
1930s
for
the
loss
of
one-half
of
their
reservation.
during
the
remainder
of
the
19th
century,
there
was
every
little
development
on
the
indian
reservation,
while
around
the
indian
reservation
substantial
non-indian
development
took
place.
so
that
by
1900,
when
only
roughly
1,700
indians
remained
on
the
reservation
despite
the
fact
that
both
tribes
were
now
permanently
located
there,
the
indians
were
desperate
to
get
started
in
farming
in
earnest.
and
congress
and
the
federal
officials
and
the
indians
themselves
were
very
anxious
about
the
availability
of
water
to
carry
on
that
farming
simply
because
of
all
the
non-indian
irrigation
development
around
the
reservation
appeared
to
have
called
for
more
water
than
would
allow
the
indians
to
continue.
so--
mr.
michael
douglas
white
--yes,
ma'am.
mr.
michael
douglas
white
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
concern
that
i
mentioned
of
the
indians,
federal
officials,
and
congress,
led
to
the
1905
act,
which
was
a
ratification
of
the
1904
agreement
with
the
indians.
and
it
was
pursuant
to
the
water
proviso
of
that
act
that
these
water
rights
were
obtained.
the
water
proviso
in
article
iii
of
the
1905
act
says
that
water
rights
shall
be
detained
under
state
law.
mr.
michael
douglas
white
it
is
close
to
that...
it
makes
no
difference,
your
honor.
i've
used
100,000
for
round
figures,
but--
mr.
michael
douglas
white
--we
agreed...
we
have
asserted,
your
honor,
when
the
litigation
began
that
there
were
102,000--
mr.
michael
douglas
white
--but
we
used
that
with
a
different
quantification
rate
and
a
different
priority
date.
mr.
michael
douglas
white
you're
right.
mr.
michael
douglas
white
with
a
different
amount
of
water
and
a
different
priority
date,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
1905
act
had
two
particular
effects.
first
was
to
open
the
reservation
to
non-indian
settlement
in
the
portion
that's
marked
as
ceded
on
your
map.
everything
north
of
the
wind,
east
of
the
xxx.
the
second
thing
was
to
allow
that
land
to
be
sold
to
non-indians
under
the
public
land
laws.
mr.
michael
douglas
white
yes,
sir,
they
are.
the
second
purpose
was
to
take
the
proceeds
that
were
enjoyed
from
the
sale
or
the
eventual
lease
of
those
lands
and
use
them
for
the
benefit
of
the...
of
the
indians.
and
one
of
those
benefits
was
to
acquire
water
rights
under
state
law,
as
i
explained
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
questions.
in
fact,
the
congressional
intent
in
this
respect
was
so
strong
that
when
the
indian
rights
association
was
concerned
about
state
rights
being
required
for
these
indian...
for
the
indian
water
rights,
it
was
proposed
in
both
committees
of...
excuse
me...
the
committees
of
each
house
of
congress
that
a
limited
reserved
right
be
established
for
the
reservation.
and
it
was
rejected.
it
was
not
included
in
the
1905
act.
and,
again,
in
1914,
a
permanent
reserved
right
was
proposed
for
the
reservation
and
it
too
was
rejected
by
congress.
it
was
stricken
on
the
floor
of
both
houses
on
a
point
of
order
as
being
a
legislative
matter
attached
to
an
appropriations
bill.
so,
congress
knew
what
it
was
doing.
it
wasn't
merely
a
way
to
spend
a
little
extra
pocket
money.
it
was
a
way
to
effectuate
congressional
intent.
after...
after
those
water
rights
were
obtained
congress
did
in
fact...
or,
excuse
me...
the
federal
government
did
in
fact
construct
substantial
irrigation
projects
on
the
reservation.
there
were--
mr.
michael
douglas
white
--that's
right.
and
by
the
beginning
of
1910
and
continuing
through
1963
the
government
began
to
relinquish
water
rights
which
were
obtained
in
excess
of
those
which
had
actually
been
used,
and
by
1963,
approximately
50,000
acres
had
been
relinquished,
leaving
87,000
acres
under
state
rights.
mr.
michael
douglas
white
well,
i'm
sure
that's
what
you
will
be
told,
your
honor.
but
the
facts
are
that
when
the
water
proviso
was
adopted
congress
knew
what
it
was
doing.
and
it
consciously
elected
to
go
the
state
law
route.
as
you
recall
from
the
briefs,
this
reservation
has
a
sister
reservation,
the
baneck,
or
the
fort
hall
reservation
in
idaho.
and
their--
mr.
michael
douglas
white
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
michael
douglas
white
apparently
they
didn't
need
them,
your
honor,
and
the
suggestion
is
made
that
the
state
cancelled
these
rights
simply
because
the
united
states
didn't
come
in
and
renew
them.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
in
1944
a
major
portion
of
these
water
rights
were
voluntarily
relinquished
by
the
indian
service
themselves.
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
is
that
there
were
water
rights
for
far
more
land
than
was
actually
irrigated
and
was
needed
to
be
irrigated.
but
in...
finishing
that
question,
the
court
ought
to
contrast
this
reservation
with
the
fort
hall
reservation
where
the
same
players
were
involved,
the
same
negotiator
and
the
same
congressional
committees.
and
in
1900...
excuse
me...
in
1904
for
the
fort
hall
reservation,
which
is
our
sister
reservation,
congress--
mr.
michael
douglas
white
--yes,
sir,
it
is
in
idaho.
congress
expressly
created
a
reserved
right.
this
was
a
year
before
the
water
proviso
on
the
1905
act.
so,
the
state
would
submit
that
there
is
no
question
that
congress
intended
that...
and
expressly
intended,
that
state
water
rights
serve
the
needs
of
this
particular
reservation.
the
award
below
was,
as
justice
o'connor
points
out,
for
approximately...
for
the
irrigation
of
approximately
100,000
acres,
of
which
70
percent
were,
previously
covered
by
state
water
rights,
of
which,
of
the
100,000,
55
percent
were
in
the
ceded
portion.
and,
is
the
court
will
recall
from
the
briefs,
the
ceded
portion
was
restored
back
to
the
reservation
in
the
1940s
for
the
purposes
of
grazing.
water
rights
were
quantified
on
that
ceded
portion,
the
restored
ceded
portion,
not
for
grazing
purposes,
but
under
the
practicably
irrigable
acreage
standard.
mr.
michael
douglas
white
that
was
the...
the
conclusion
of
the
master,
and
it
was
the
decision
at
the
first
district
court
judge
that
heard
the
case.
post-trial
motions
were
heard
by
a
second
second
district
court
judge.
the
first
district
court
judge
and
the
master
directed
their
attention
to
the
future
projects.
there
were
about
50...
of
the
total
awards,
half
the
land
had
been
historically
irrigated,
the
other
half
had
been
part
of
future
projects
that
would
be
irrigated
in
the
future
according
to
the
united
states
and
tripes
evidence.
and
it
was
the
future
projects
that
the
court
below,
the
master
and
the
district
court
judge
were
most
concerned
about.
and
they
suggested
that...
first,
the
master...
that
the
future
projects
not
be
allowed
to
go
into
operation
right
away.
and
the
master
observed
that
would
be
no
harm
to
the
indians
because
everyone
knows
they
wouldn't
be
built
anyway...
they
not
be
allowed
to
go
into
operation
right
away
but
be
required
to
go
in
10
percent
per
decade.
that
was
his
thought.
the...
the
district
court
judge
approached
it
a
little
bit
differently.
he
said
that
instead
of
the
10
percent
phasing
approach
to
putting
these
futures
into
effect,
let's
have
storage,
and
if
there
is
a
future
project
that
requires
"x"
acre
feet,
let's
have
storage
in
that
amount.
the
second
district
court
judge
that
heard
it,
rejected
the
storage
approach.
he
rejected
the
concept
of
storage
because
it
was
part
and
parcel
of
estoppel.
what
the
first
district
court
judge
had
said
was
that
the
united
states
under
these
circumstances
is
estopped
to
claim
a
reserved
right
which
would,
in
his
words,
put...
or,
render
the
state
water
rights
virtually
worth
less.
those
were
his
words.
so,
he
said
if
there
is
estoppel,
to
remedy
that
estoppel
we'll
have
the
storage.
now,
the
second
district
court
judge
said,
sorry,
no
affirmative
misconduct
by
the
united
states.
when
they
acquired
these
state
water
rights,
there
wasn't
anything
wrong
with
that,
so
there
wasn't
any
affirmative
misconduct.
estoppel
doesn't
apply.
so
by
the
time
we
got
out
of
the
district
court
through
our
post-trial
motions,
there
were
no...
no
conditions
imposed
on
the
water
right,
on
the
reserved
water
right,
which
would
serve
to
protect
the
owners
of
state
water
rights.
now,
that
was
completely
gone
and
when
we
suggested
that
the
sensitivity
doctrine
or
the
whole
decision
of
this
court
in
new
mexico
would
require
some
inquiries
as
part
of
the
quantification
process
into
the
factors
described
in
new
mexico,
the
thought
was
by
the
wyoming
courts
that
those
went
to
questions
of
purposes
and
they
didn't
go
to
the
question
of
quantification.
the...
what
we
suggested
to
the
wyoming
court
was
that
the
new
mexico
decision
and
the
decisions
which
immediately
preceded
that
and
followed
it
established
four
criteria
for
the...
for
the
quantification
of
watery
or
of
an
implied
reserved
right.
first,
that
there
be
an
inquiry
into
the
specific
purpose
of
the
reservation,
and
our
complaint
with
that
was,
of
course,
all
of
the
restored
lands
were
for
grazing
purposes,
restored
for
grazing
purposes.
they
were
not
restored
for
irrigation
purposes.
and
yet,
the
pia
doctrine
was
used
to
quantify
water
rights
for
those
restored
lands.
in
fact,
the
largest
of
the
future
projects...
it
takes...
it's
about
about
a
hundred
and...
excuse
me...
about
40,000
acres
of
future
project
is
located
on
restored
land
which
was
restored
in
1944
for
grazing
purposes.
yet,
the
water
right
that
was
quantified
for
it
was
for
irrigation.
and
that
requires
a
remarkable
clairvoyance
on
the
part
of
congress
if
part
of
this
effort
is
to
inquire
into
congressional
intent
that
in
1944
water...
land
would
be
restored
for
grazing
purposes
and
yet
it
receives
an
1968
priority
date
for
irrigation
purposes.
the
second
thing
that
the
new
mexico
court...
or,
this
court
in
its
decision
in
new
mexico,
said
was
that
there
should
be
an
inquiry
into
need
for
the
water
because
this
court
said
that
there
had
been
a
careful
examination
every
time
this
reserved
right
doctrine
had
been
applied
to
insure
that
the
water
was
needed
to
keep
the
primary
purpose
of
the
reservation...
or,
the
specific
purpose
of
the
reservation
from
being
defeated.
there
was
no
evidence
of
need
in
the
court
below,
in
the
record
below.
the
thought
of
the
united
states...
at
trial...
was
all
they
needed
to
do
was
show
pia.
pia,
since
arizona
1
had
become
the
standard--
mr.
michael
douglas
white
--historically
about
54,000.
mr.
michael
douglas
white
well,
of
courser
it's
evidence
of
need,
your
honor,
but
it's
not
a
question
of
whether...
of
need
unsatisfied.
that's
land
that's
been
irrigated
under
the
very
state
water
rights
that--
mr.
michael
douglas
white
--that
congress--
mr.
michael
douglas
white
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
douglas
white
i'm
sorry.
and,
as
a
practical
matter,
there
wasn't
any
provided
by
the
tribes
in
the
united
states.
the
state,
at
the
end
of
the
case
in
chief,
filed
is
rule
41
motion...
or,
made
its
rule
41
motion
on
the
question
of
need.
and
that
matter...
the
question
of
need
was
no
longer
addressed
by
the
court
until
we
got
to
appeal.
finally,
there
is...
or,
another
factor
this
court
indicated
in
new
mexico
should
be
considered
is
deference
to
state
law.
it
said
that
the
court
had
always
been
careful
with
the
reserved
right
doctrine
because
of
the
implied
nature
of
the
reserved
water
right
and
congress
history
of
deference
to
state
law.
and
it
also
observed
that
when
congress
had
expressly
addressed
the
question
of
whether
state
law
should
apply,
that
it
had
invariably
deferred
to
state
law.
what
could
be
a
better
example
than
the
1905
act?
there
is
an
expressed
deference
to
state
law.
and
yet
that
third
factor,
the
deference
factor,
was
excluded
from
the
wyoming
court's
quantification
of
the
reserved
right.
mr.
michael
douglas
white
fifty...
about
54,000--
mr.
michael
douglas
white
--have
been
historically
irrigated.
mr.
michael
douglas
white
i
think
you
measure
the
need
based
on
congress'
intent
at
the
time
of
the
initial
reservation.
we
are
trying
to--
mr.
michael
douglas
white
--well,
i
agree
that
54,000
is
irrelevant,
your
honor.
but
what's
relevant
is
the
87,000
of
state
water
rights
that
are
still
left
that
have
not
been
cancelled.
historically,
after
a
hundred
years
of
existence,
54,000
acres
have
been
irrigated
on
the
reservation.
and
never
more
than
that.
in
any
one
year
only
about
35,000.
and,
yet,
under
the
water
proviso
state
water
rights,
87,000
acres
may
be
irrigated.
and
there's
no
suggestion
that
at
any
time,
and
no
evidence
that
under
any
particular
scenario,
more
than
the
87,000...
or
90,000
in
round
numbers--
mr.
michael
douglas
white
--would
ever
be
needed
to
be
irrigated.
as
a
practical
matter,
if
the
needs
of
the
indians
should
shift
from
an
agricultural-based
economy
to
some
other
based
economy,
under
wyoming
law
those
state
water
rights
can
be
changed
to
other
purposes
so
long
as
the
consumptive
use
is
not
increased.
mr.
michael
douglas
white
well,
it
does--
mr.
michael
douglas
white
--it
does
assume
that
you're
only--
--well,
it
says
it's
for
practicable
irrigable
acreages.
how
much
do
you
need
for
agriculture?
well,
it
certainly
isn't
measured
by
the
pia
doctrine,
as
we
found
out
below.
mr.
michael
douglas
white
that's
correct.
and
it
certainly
doesn't
measure
what
congress
may
have
had
in
mind
for
the...
for
the
agricultural
needs
of
that
reservation.
that--
mr.
michael
douglas
white
--we
would
fix
it
based
on
what
congress
said,
your
honor.
not
our
understanding,
but
what
they
said
in
1905,
in
the
1905
act
water
proviso.
mr.
michael
douglas
white
if
this
court
defers
to
express
congressional
intent,
it
would
be.
if
this
court
wishes
to
go
behind
the
expressed
intent
and
find
another
intent
by
implication,
i
don't
see
how
it
could
be.
if
it--
mr.
michael
douglas
white
--that's
correct.
and
that's
res
judicata.
mr.
michael
douglas
white
it
never
will
be.
mr.
michael
douglas
white
either
that
or
make
a
new
appropriation
or
a
new
reservation.
i'm
not
sure
i
responded
to
your
question,
justice
kennedy.
i'm--
mr.
michael
douglas
white
--where
you're
really
trying
to
determine
intent...
as
of
1868,
as
of
the
date
of
the
treaty.
but
just
as
congress
can
enter
into
these
various
settlement
acts
to
settle
indian
water
right
disputes,
it
can
adopt
the
1905
act.
and
if
any...
in
theory,
anything
that
happened
after
1905
is
irrelevant.
but
this
case
is
here
on
the
question
of
what
is
the
proper
quantification
standard,
not
whether
the
water
right
continues
to
exist.
now,
had
you
accepted
certiorari
on
the
first
question,
we
would
have
been
arguing
that
you
can
stop
in
1905
and
not
worry.
but
you
accepted
certiorari
on
the
second
question,
which
is
the
measure
of
the
reserve
right,
and
that's...
that's
why
we're
here.
mr.
michael
douglas
white
well,
it
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
what
congress
intended
in
1868.
mr.
michael
douglas
white
once
the
1905
act
came
along,
it
occurs
to
me,
your
honor,
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
what
congress'
intent
was
in
19...
or,
excuse
me...
1868,
unless
it
was
congress'
intent
to
reserve
more
water
than
that
for
which
state
awarded
water
rights
were
obtained
in
1905.
mr.
michael
douglas
white
they
do
it
all
the
time
under
this...
as
early
as
1896
in
a
case
involving
this
particular
reservation.
it
wasn't
a
water
right
case,
but...
ward
v.
racehorse.
express
indian
treaty
rights
were
taken
away
under
the
plenary
power
of
congress.
mr.
michael
douglas
white
that's
true.
and
voluntarily
so,
your
honor.
i
would...
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
michael
douglas
white
i
do,
your
honor.
the
suggestion
was
made
by
counsel
for
the
tribes
that
they
are
poised
for
a
period
of
economic
development,
and
reference
was
made
to
a
number
of
examples
of
why
that
position
is
now
enjoyed.
i'd
point
out
to
the
court
that
none
of
that
material
is
in
the
record.
there
was
no
evidence
below
of
any
poised
tribe,
or
anything
like
that.
the
evidence
below--
mr.
michael
douglas
white
--i
suppose,
your
honor,
but
if
you'd
like
to
ask
me
about
the
record,
i'd
be
glad
to
respond.
mr.
michael
douglas
white
well,
if
i've...
it
i
have
failed
to
do
so,
your
honor,
i
wish
you'd
call
it
to
my--
mr.
michael
douglas
white
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i
tried
to
make
it
clear
that
that
was
outside
the
record.
there
have
been...
there
has
been
some
suggestion
that
the...
there
is
no
acre-for-acre...
or,
excuse
me,
gallon-for-gallon
reduction
in
wyoming
for
state
water
rights
as
a
result
of
the
reserved
right.
and
that
is
what
the
wyoming
supreme
court
did
say.
but
the
triers
of
fact,
the
master
in
the
district
court,
did
not
say
the
same
thing.
at
page
232(a)
of
the
petitioner's
appendix
you
will
find
the
district
court's
observation
that
"holders
of
state
awarded
water
rights
will
find
their
formerly
valuable
water
rights
worthless.
"
mr.
michael
douglas
white
they
didn't
look
at
it,
your
honor.
they
made
the...
just
made
the
conclusion
that
there
is
no
finding
below
and
you're
as
free
as
the
wyoming
supreme
court
to
look
at
the
findings
below.
mr.
michael
douglas
white
yes,
sir.
it's
also
been
suggested
that
the
55
percent
of
the
pia
that
was
restored
to
the
reservation
had
no
relation
to
grazing
purpose.
no
purpose
at
all
was
described.
i
would
refer
the
court
to
page
741(a)
of
the
petitioner's
appendix
in
which
is
located
the
restoration
order
for
the
largest
of
the
future
project.
and
it
says,
whereas
the
tripes...
quote...
"require
additional
grazing
land
to
support
their
expanded
livestock
industry.
"
--close
quote...
there
will
be
a
restoration.
mr.
michael
douglas
white
absolutely.
and
that
points
out
the
stark
distinction
between
the
state
and
federal
rights
involved
here.
we're--
mr.
michael
douglas
white
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
as
have
been
argued.
the
state
water
right
user,
if
he
wished
to
change
his
water
right
to
a
different
use
or
a
different
place
of
use
or
a
different
time
of
use,
would
have
to
demonstrate
that
that
change
would
not
injure
anyone
else.
not
only
that
it
wouldn't
injure
anyone
else,
but
that
there
had
been
continued
use
over
a
long
period
of
time,
over
a
long
what's
called
historic
use,
before
that
change
could
be
made.
each
of
the
western
states
has
a
mechanism
established
for
changing
existing
state
water
rights.
none
of
them
allow
a
change
without
an
inquiry
into
historic
use
and
injury.
mr.
michael
douglas
white
in
one
way
or
the
other
every
state
has
either
an
abandonment
or
a
forfeiture
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
douglas
white
that's
right.
it...
every...
i
know
of
none
where
the
period
is
less
than
five
years,
and
several
where
the
period
is
as
much
as
ten.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
that's
all
i
have,
your
honor.
