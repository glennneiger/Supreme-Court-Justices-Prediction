justice
o'connor
mr.
white--
justice
o'connor
--is
it
the
fact
that
before
1915
that
the
federal
government
had
obtained
protective
state
water
permits
sufficient
to
irrigate
145,000
acres?
justice
o'connor
the
acreage
found
to
be
practicably
irrigable
in
this
litigation
by
the
wyoming
supreme
court
was
108,000
acres?
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
the
state
had
apparently
even
agreed
that
it
was
102,000.
justice
o'connor
un-huh.
justice
o'connor
but
applying
the
practical...
the
practicably...
it's
hard
to
say?
justice
o'connor
--irrigable
standard,
the
state
had
agreed
it
was
at
least
102,000?
justice
o'connor
marked
ceded
land?
justice
o'connor
but
not
enough
to
irrigate
the
145,000
acres,
i
take
it?
justice
o'connor
i
suppose
the
federal
government
says,
though,
that
it
relinquished
those
after
the
winters
doctrine
had
been
established.
so
they
didn't
think
they
were
giving
up
anything
that
couldn't
be
restored.
justice
o'connor
mr.
white,
there
is
some
suggestion
in
the
briefs
somewhere
in
this
case
that
with
some
additional
storage
of
water
that
the
full
exercise
by
the
tribes
of
their
rights
to
the
108,000
acres
would
have
no
adverse
effect
on
existing
users.
is
that
correct?
justice
o'connor
mr.
minear,
in
calculating
what's
practicably
irrigable,
is
it
necessary
to
take
into
the
calculus
whether
additional
irrigation
projects
are
reasonably
likely
to
be
constructed
to
make
it
possible?
justice
o'connor
or
the
federal
government--
justice
o'connor
--on
their
behalf?
justice
o'connor
no.
i'm
talking
about
measuring
the
practicably
irrigable
acreage.
justice
o'connor
does
one
have
to
take
into
the
calculus
whether
any
of
these
projects
to
make
it
irrigable
will
be
constructed?
justice
o'connor
that
could
be
run.
would
those
projects
have
met
bureau
of
reclamations
standards
or
are
they
projects
that
in
fact
are
likely
to
be
constructed?
justice
o'connor
does
the
calculus
of
the
practicably
irrigable
land
depend
in
anyway
on
whether
the
tribes
intend
to
farm
it
themselves
or
intend
to
sell
off
the
rights
they
obtain?
justice
o'connor
that
what?
justice
o'connor
and
use--
justice
o'connor
--it
themselves--
justice
o'connor
--rather
than
sell
it
off?
justice
o'connor
and
is
that,
in
your
view,
part
of
the
necessary
calculus?
justice
o'connor
well,
is
it
part
of
the
standard
that
the
court
determines
in
this
pia
question?
justice
o'connor
is
that
a
premise--
justice
o'connor
--of
the
standard?
justice
o'connor
and
you
agree
that
it
should
be
part
of
the
standard?
justice
o'connor
mr.
minear,
why
did
the
government,
give
up
state
water
rights--
justice
o'connor
--in
the
early
part
of
the
century?
justice
o'connor
well,
you
allowed
some
to...
to
lapse.
justice
o'connor
--mr.
minear,
do
you
have
any
idea
now
many
more
areas
there
are
in
the
united
states
where
there
are
reserved
water
rights
for
tribes
that
haven't
yet
been
determined?
justice
o'connor
well,
there
are
a
lot
more
yet
to
be
determined,
in
other
words.
justice
o'connor
like
how
many?
justice
o'connor
uh-huh.
