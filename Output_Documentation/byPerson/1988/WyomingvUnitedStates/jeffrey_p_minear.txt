mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
sole
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
wyoming
supreme
court
erred
in
following
this
court's
decision
in
arizona
i
in
measuring
the
tribe's
reserved
water
right
based
on
the
pia
standard.
we
submit
that
the
wyoming
supreme
court's
decision
was
correct
for
three
reasons.
first,
this
case
is
indistinguishable
from
arizona
i.
second,
this
court's
decision
in
arizona
i
is
sensible
and
correct
and
should
not
be
discarded
or
replaced.
and,
third,
the
retention
of
arizona
i's
pia
standard
is
essential
to
insure
an
orderly,
efficient,
and
certain
resolution
of
this
and
other
ongoing
indian
water
rights
disputes.
i
would
like
to
begin
by
emphasizing
the
question
here
is
not
a
matter
of
first
impression.
this
court
addressed
how
to
measure
indian
water
rights
25
years
ago
in
arizona
i.
it
applied
the
pia
standard,
relying
on
special
master
rifkin's
careful
analysis
of
the
matter.
arizona
i's
logic
is
both
straight
forward
and
compelling.
since
the
united
states
set
the
reservation
lands
asl
de
to
enable
the
indians
to
become
productive
farmers,
the
natural
measure
of
their
reserved
water
right
is
the
amount
of
water
necessary
to
make
their
agricultural
land
productive.
the
court's
reliance
on
irrigable
acreage
was
not
novel.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
not
here--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
justice
scalla,
i
think
your...
your
concern
really
was
answered
in
winters
in
1908.
this
is
the
question
that
was
presented
in
winters.
was
there
a
reserved
water
right
that
was
created
by
the
creation
of
an
agricultural
indian
reservation?
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
pardon?
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
don't...
no,
they're
not
selling
water
to
my...
it's
not
my
understanding.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
don't
believe
that's...
that's
true.
i
think
that
perhaps
the
tribes'
counsel
has
a
better
answer
to
that,
but
it's
my
understanding
that
they
are
not.
they
are
leasing
some
of
their
indian
lanes
for
farming
purposes,
but
i
don't
believe
that
they're
selling
any
of
their
water
rights
here.
in
any
event--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--at
present,
no
they're
not
using
all
the
water.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it's
flowing
downstream
and
being
used
by
non-indians.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
don't...
i
believe
that
last
year...
and,
again,
i
think
the
tribes'
representative
is
probably
more
knowledgeable
on
this
point
than
i
am.
but
last
year
i
believe
that
they
did
attempt
to
assert
the
rights
that
were
decreed
by
the
wyoming
courts.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
believe
it
was
for
irrigation
purposes.
these
were
for
irrigation
purposes
on
indian
lands.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
again,
this...
this
is
all
outside
the
record,
first
of
all.
this
was
brought
up
by
wyoming
in
addition
of
their
factual
statement
described
as
subsequent
events
outside
the
record.
so,
i
don't
know
now
much
you'll
find
in
terms
of
accuracy,
in
terms
of
what
actually
happened
here.
but
i
believe
it's
the
tribes'
view
that
this
was
a
comprehensive
settlement
of
certain
other
matters,
as
well
as
certain
water
rights
disputes.
but
i'd
like
to
return
to
what...
the
question
you
originally
raised,
justice
scalia,
which
is
the
measure
of
the
water
and
the
water
right
when
the
reservation
land
was
set
aside.
i
think
it's
quite
logical
that
when
these
parties
determined
a
set
amount
of
acreage
to
be
set
aside
for
a
reservation
and
also
determined
that
a
certain
amount
of
that
land
would
be
available
for
farming...
in
this
case,
it's
less
than
five
percent
of
the
total
reservation
acreage...
that
the
reserved
water
right
would
be
sufficient
to
meet
those
farming
needs.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
in
terms
of...
are
you
talking
about
irrigation
projects
constructed
by
the
indians
to
put
their
water
to
use
or--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--in--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--in
planning
future
projects
what
the
government,
does,
it
goes
through,
as
the
first
step--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
i
think
that
that
is
what
we
have
come
up
with.
our
economic
analysis
represents
projects
that
can
in
fact
be
profitably
run.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
they
would
exceed
bureau
of
reclamation
standards.
the...
the
economic
analysis
that
we
impose
on
indian
projects
is
in
fact
stricter
than
the
bureau
of
reclamation's
analysis.
and,
in
facts
that
has
been
one
of
the
concerns
of
the
tribe,
that
we
in
fact
impose
more
rigorous
economic
requirements
on
the
tribes
than
the
bureau
of
reclamation
imposes
on
non-indian
farmers.
as
far
as
these
projects
being
constructed,
these
projects
can
be
constructed.
i
think
there's
a
good
likelihood
that
they
would
be
constructed
because
they
in
fact
would
bring
in
income
to
the
tribe.
these
are
not
simply
fantasy
projects.
these
are
real
projects
that
have
been
analyzed
based
on
sound
engineering,
scientific
and
economic
factors.
and
we...
one
need
only
examine
the
special
master's
report
to
see
how
carefully
these
matters
were
in
fact
considered.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
essentially
what
they
would
do
is
they
would
increase
the
water
supply
to
land
that
is
practicably
irrigable.
that
is
irrigable
in
that
sense.
that
this
is...
there
is
good
farm
land
cut
there
that
could
be
in
fact
put
to
use
and
could
grow
profitable
crops
that
could
be
sold
on
the
market.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
the
tripes'
plans
are
that
the
indians
would
farm
it.
and,
in
fact,
the
economic
analysis
was
done
on
that
basis.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
it
does
depend
on
the
fact
that
the
tribes
will
sell
it
themselves.
i
think
that
that
was
the
basis--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--it
does...
it
does
take
into
account
that
the
tribes
would
develop
these
lands.
that
was
the
basis
of
the--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--economic
analysis.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
and
use
it--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--and
use
it
themselves.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
it
was
a
part
of
the
calculus
here
in
terms
of--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--if
that
is
one
of
the
premises
of
the
standard,
then,
of
course,
that
is
going
to
be
a
factor
in
the
economic
analysis
here.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
if
that
was
a
premise.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
i
believe
that
it
was
a
premise
of
the
standard
here.
that
the
tribes
themselves
would
operate
these
farms.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
i
think
that
that
seems
appropriate.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
standard
is
based
on
1980
projections,
in
large
part
by
agreement
by
all
the
parties.
wyoming,
in
fact,
agreed
to
this,
to
the
use
of
current
technology
and
in
fact
advocated
it.
and
although
this
issue
has
been
raised
rather
late,
i
would
refer
to
you
in
the
record,
the
volume
5
of
wyoming's
proposed
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law,
15-12
at
page
623.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
it
doesn't.
but
i
think
there
are
good
reasons
for
using
the...
the
current--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
the
projects
might
nave
been
smaller,
but
there
would
nave
been
much
greater
water
usage.
and
i
think
there
are
three
good
reasons
for
using
the
current
technology,
in
any
event.
our
first
is
a
matter
of
precedent.
this
is
what
was
done
in
arizona
i.
and,
in
fact,
this
special
master
notes...
i
think
that's
at
page
535(a)
of
the
special
master
report.
second,
simply
as
a
matter
of
the
feasibility
of
proof.
we
can
in
fact
get
experts
who
can
testify
on
the
economics
and
the
engineering
aspects
of
present
irrigation
systems.
and
those
matters
can
be
proven.
this
is
a
matter
that
is,
to
use
wyoming's
terminology,
capable
of
proof.
trying
to
prove
1868
irrigation
technology
would
be
fairly
speculative
and
i
think
would
probably
make
the...
would
decrease
the
accuracy
of
the
actual
water
determination
here.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
are
growing--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--or,
the
tribes,
in
fact,
are
growing
alfalfa
and
small
grains.
the
economic
analysis
was
based
on
those
particular
crops.
those
are
the
same
crops
that
are
grown
by
non-indians.
on
that
subject,
since
we're
talking...
since
wyoming
did
raise
the
question
of
the
restoration
of
lands
for
grazing
purposes,
i
think
that's
incorrect,
and
i
would
simply
refer
you
again
to
the
special
master's
report
in
the
petition
appendix.
the
petition
appendix
indicates
in
the
restoration
orders...
there
is
no
mention
that
these
lands
were
restored
for
grazing
purposes.
they
are
simply
restored
to
the
tribe
to
be
used
for
whatever
purposes
might
be
appropriate.
and
so
it's
perfectly
acceptable
to
quantify
the
water
right
on
that
based
on
the
fact
that
they
can
be
irrigable
land.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
what--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--there's
two
critical
periods
where
this
occurred.
first
of
all,
as
i
think
our
brief
points
out,
we
sought
protective
water
rights
shortly
before
winters.
after
winters
was
decided,
to
a
large
extent
we
ceased
seeking
out
those
permits.
we
believed
that
winters--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--in
1963
after
arizona
i.
that,
in
fact,
reflects
our
view
of...
of
what
this
court
held
in
arizona
i.
it
established
the
pia
standard.
we
felt,
therefore,
there
was
no
further
need
to
continue
to
create
this
paper
cloud
on
state
water
rights
system.
and
what
we
actually
did
here
is
we
simply
did
not
renew
them.
these
permits
nave
not
been
cancelled.
and,
in
fact,
there
is
a
phase
three
proceeding
in
this...
in
this
case
that
will
in
fact
go
through
the
permits
one
by
one
and
determine
which
permits
should
be
retained
and
which
should
be
formally
cancelled
by
the
state.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it's...
it's
my
understanding
that
one
simply
needs
to
file
an
extension
and
they
can
extend
it
every
five
years
or
so.
so,
this
is
a
common
practice
and
a
big
problem
in
wyoming,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
third
reason
is
i
think
that
this
is
consistent
with
what
congress
probably
intended
back
in
1868.
when
congress
looked
at
this...
or,
i
should
say,
the
treaty
partners
since
this
is
a
treaty
in
this
case,
and
it
should
be
interpreted
with
respect
to
the
indians
in
that
regard.
but
i
think
the
treaty
parties
recognized
that
the
indians
would
have
ample
water
to
irrigate
their
lands.
in
fact,
it's
reasonable
for
the
tribes
to
believe
they
would
have
had
all
the
water
in
this
water
shed
since
the
lane
was
being
set
aside
for
them.
but,
in
any
event,
they
probably
were
not
thinking
about
a
specific
number
of
acre
feet
of
water
that
would
be
applicable,
and
i
think
the
best
inference
of
what
they
would
have
intended
is
that
when...
if
there
came
a
time
and
need
for
quantifying
that
standard,
or
quantifying
the
amount
of
water
that
is
necessary,
it
would
be
done
on
the
best
available
information.
and
that's
what
we've
done
here
in
1980.
i
think
that
wyoming
all
but
concedes
that
this
case
is
indistinguishable
from
arizona
i
and,
therefore,
at
least
in
its
brief,
it's
forced
to
argue
that
arizona
i
itself
must
be
discarded
or
replaced.
now,
we
disagree
with
this.
this
court
does
not
lightly
discard
its
precedence.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
that
it
odes
contain
the
core
kernel
of
reasoning
that's
important
to
the...
the
determination
of
a
water
right.
namely,
there
is
the
feasible
and
fair
method
for
determining
the
amount
of
water
that's
needed
for
land
that's
set
aside--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--for
agricultural
purposes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but
the
discussion
took
place
in
the
special
master's
report,
which,
in
fact,
that's
appended
to
our
brief.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
on
the
other
hand,
the
statement
in
the
opinion
in
arizona
i
was
that
we
agreed
with
the
special
masters
report.
that's
in
fact
what
the
court
has
said.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
pardon?
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
about
those
particular
reservations.
but
these
reservations
are
indistinguishable.
in
fact,
there
is
a
stronger
argument.
i
think,
in
this
case
than
in
those
cases.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
right.
the
history
here
supports
wyoming's--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--with
respect
to
the
agricultural--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--but
the--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--they...
they
might
be
different
reservations,
but
the
agricultural
purpose
of
these
reservations
is
even
more
clear
than
those
executive
order
ones.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
treaty
itself
indicates,
thought
that
at
was
for
other
tribes
that
might
be
settled
amongst
them.
so
i
don't
think
that
it's...
it
was
clear
that
only
the
shoshones
would...
that
only
the
shoshones
would
reside
on
that
tribe.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
i
think--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--the
idea
that
these
tribes
would
become
very
rich
oft
of
this
grant
of
water
is
simply
a
fantasy.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
and
i
think
it's
very
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
size
of
the
reservation
and
the
amount
of
arable
land
that
was
set
aside
for
them
represented
the
best
judgment
of
the
treaty
partners
of
what
their
future
needs
might
be.
i
don't
know
how
else
you
would
measure
the
future
needs
except
by
the
amount
of
land
that
the
parties
determined
was
necessary
to
meet
those
future
needs.
this
was
set
aside
as
a
permanent
homeland
for
the
tribes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
it
does
in
the
sense
that
they
do
need...
that
the
measure
of
necessity
is
the
amount
of
water
that's
needed
to
irrigate
the
practicability
irrigable
land.
and,
in
fact,
that's
what.
wyoming
had
argued.
if
you
look
at
their
objections
to
the
special
masters
report,
pages
24
through
27,
their
objection
to
the
pia
standard
was...
in
fact,
they
did
not
object.
they
said
that
that
was
the...
in
essence
argued
that
that
was
a
part
of
the
minimal
needs
test.
the
pia
standard
should
be
applied
in
this
case.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
don't
believe
so,
except
tot
the
fact
of
the
matter...
not
in
this
case...
that
we're
being
held...
the
tribes
are
being
held
to
a
stricter
efficiency
standard
than
anyone
else
in
both
their
historic
lands
and
their
future
lands.
and,
again,
this
simply
verifies
that
the
amount
of
water
that
was
quantified
here
is
really
quite
reasonable.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's...
well,
that
is
in
the
very
nature
of
a
reserved
water
right.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
think
that
that
has
been
the
clear
implication.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
it
there
is
a
problem--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--but
the
federal
reserve
water
rights
are
an
exception
to
the--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--but
if
the
water
was
initially
reserved
for
the
reservation,
it
was
set
aside
by
congress,
the
it
seems
as
if
congress
is
the
party
that
needs
to
worry
if
there
are
later
shortcomings--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--but
i
think
congress--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--has
relied
on
every
decision
since
the...
has
been
relying
on
every
decision
since
the
1908
winters
decision,
including
the
powers
decision,
including
arizona
i.
in
fact,
the
present
congressional
activity
indicates
that
sort
of
reliance.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
i
think
that
there
are
a
good
number
of
those.
and
those
are
presently
being
quantified...
and
settlements
are
being
made,
and
they're
being
done
on
the
pia
standards.
and
that's
one
of
the
important
reasons
why
the
pia
standard
should
be
retained.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
there
are
a
fair
number
that
need
to
be
determined.
yes,
but--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--many
of
them...
there
could
be
as
many
as
20,
i
suppose.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
perhaps
more.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
that
when
a
special
master's
report
has
been
incorporated
into
existing
law
to
the
extent
that
the
special
master's
report
has
here,
i
think
it's
very
important
to
recognize
the
element
of
certainty
that
it
has
created.
i
would
like
to
also
point
out
that
since
the
question
of
shortages
has
come
up--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--but
i
think
once
the
right
is
quantified,
there
is
no
uncertainty.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
and
with
respect
to
the
notion
of
shortages
the
chief
justice
raised,
i'd
simply
point
out
that
the
wyoming
supreme
court
noted
here
that
there
would
be...
there
was
no
indication
of
any
gallon-for-gallon
reduction
in
this
case.
and
for
that
reason,
it
eliminated
the
storage
requirement
that
was...
that
had
been
imposed
by
the
lower
courts
in
any
event.
so,
the
extent
that
we're
talking
about
interference
with
other
water
rights,
that
is
not
present
in
this
case,
and
i
would
suggest
that
we
should
wait
until
one
of
those
cases
actually
arises
before
we
raise
that
as
a...
as
a
concern
for
setting
aside
the
pia
standard.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
that's
right
in
this
basin.
but,
also,
there's
a
limited
amount
of
irrigable
land
in
this
basin.
and
the
general
view
is
that
the...
for
the
land
that
is
now
in
service,
there
would
not
be
any
gallon-for-gallon
reduction
for
that
land.
i
see
that
my
time
has
expired.
