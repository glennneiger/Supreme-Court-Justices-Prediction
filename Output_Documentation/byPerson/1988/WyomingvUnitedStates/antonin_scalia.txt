justice
scalia
general
white,
can
i
ask
about
your
need
point?
when
is
that
need
to
be
measured?
i
mean,
whenever
the
litigation
happens
to
come
up?
i
mean,
you
might
say
right
now
there's...
there's
no
more
need
than...
than
how
many
acres
did
you
say,
50,000
or
so?
justice
scalia
yes.
justice
scalia
but,
you
know,
20
years
from
now
if
it
turns
out
that
they
can
prove
that
they
want
to
farm
more
than
that
but
can't
do
it
because
of
lack
of
water,
then
is
the
1868
grant
automatically
increased?
when
do
you
measure
the
need?
justice
scalia
so,
the
54,000
is
irrelevant.
you...
you
would
have
to
look
back
to
1868
and
figure
the
need
then,
i
guess.
justice
scalia
uh-huh.
justice
scalia
what
does
the
1905
act
have
to
do
with
what
congress
intended
in
1868?
that's
a...
that's
a
long
time
spread
in
between
all
of
that.
i
mean--
justice
scalia
--so,
if
congress
intended
more
in
1868,
if
it
intended
enough
water
for
all
the
practicably
irrigable
acreage,
congress,
by
passing
the
1905
act
was
what?
just
giving
additional
water?
or
whatever.
it
could
do
that,
i
suppose.
justice
scalia
well,
can
they
just
take
away
the
water
rights
they
had
given
in
1868?
could
they--
justice
scalia
well,
why...
why
is
that
such
a
natural
conclusion?
i
mean,
why
would
you
say
that...
if
you
give
somebody
a
certain
amount
of
agricultural
land,
i
assume
you
would
think
that
he'd
have
as
much
water
as
everybody
else
around
him.
justice
scalia
but
not
all
the
water
and
then
whatever
is
left
over
can
be
used
for
everybody
else.
justice
scalia
oh,
yeah,
i'm
not
questioning
the
reservation
of
the
right.
i'm
questioning
the
volume
of
it,
why
you...
you
asserted
as
simply
self-evident
that
if
you
reserve
any
water
right,
you
reserve
enough
water
not
just
to
enable
this
tract
of
land
to
be
irrigated
as
well
as
anything
in
the
area
is
irrigated,
but
rather
to
have
this
tract
of
land
irrigated
a
100
percent
even
if
everything
around
it
has
to
go
dry.
--people
are
selling
water?
justice
scalia
these
people
are
not
selling
water,
are
they?
justice
scalia
didn't
they
receive
a
payment
from
the
state
not
to
assert
those
rights?
justice
scalia
but
it
was
also...
this...
this
reservation
was
intended
for
particular
tribes,
shoshone
and
later
another
tribe
was
added.
but--
justice
scalia
--well,
in
arizona
it
was
clear
that
it
was...
it
was
not
for
any
particular
tribe
or
others
that
might
settle
amongst
them.
but
for
all
indians.
isn't
that
right?
i
mean,
i
find
it
difficult
to
believe
that
in
1868
congress,
no
matter
what
the
size
of
the
indian
population
that
was
contemplated
to
be
on
the...
on
the
reservation
in
question,
should
be
deemed
to
have
said
we're
giving
enough
water
to
irrigate
every...
every
inch
of
arable
land.
no
matter
how
large
the
tribe
they
thought
they
were
settling.
did
they
expect
to
make
some
tribes
very
rich
so
they
could
have
an
enormous
export
business--
justice
scalia
--in
agricultural
products
or--
justice
scalia
--well,
i
thought...
i
thought
that
the
purpose
of
the...
of
the
agricultural
grant
was
to
enable
them
to
grow
food
by
which
they
would
live.
