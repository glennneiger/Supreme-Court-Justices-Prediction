chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
near
argument
now
in
no.
88-309,
the
state
of
wyoming
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
white.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
white.
mr.
minear.
chief
justice
rehnquist
haven't
they
sold
water
in
the
past?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
would
these
projects
do?
make
more
irrigable
land
available
to
the
indians?
chief
justice
rehnquist
now,
does
this
mean
that
indians
would
be
farming
it
or
that
the
indians
would
lease
it
to
other
people?
chief
justice
rehnquist
can
you,
under
wyoming
law,
retain
a
right
that
long?
it's
a
matter
of
state
law,
at
any
rate?
chief
justice
rehnquist
arizona
i
contains
virtually
no
reasoning.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--ordinarily
in
a
court
opinion
that
is
a
conclusion
you
reach
after
a
discussion
of
possibilities.
all
that
is
is
a
statement
of
a
conclusion.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yeah,
but
ordinarily
we
don't
consider
the
report
of
a
special
master
as
someone
incorporated
by
reference
into
the
court's
opinion.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
about
those--
chief
justice
rehnquist
it's
not
a
total
exception
as
if
it
stood
there
on
a
plateau
all
by
itself
while
all
the
appropriative
rights
went
down
to
nothing.
there...
there
is
no
doctrine
of
water
law
that
elevates
one
water
right
over
the
other
to
that
extent.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but,
of
course,
the
whole...
the
whole
winters
doctrine
is
just
an
implication
to
congress.
congress
never
said
in
so
many
words,
we're
reserving
a
water
right.
that's
just
what
this
court
said
congress
must
have
intended.
so,
congress
has
never
even
spoken.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
they
certainly
haven't
spoken
with--
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
ms.
williams.
chief
justice
rehnquist
ms.
williams,
the
winters
doctrine
was
just
an
intent
that
this
court
attributed
to
congress,
wasn't
it?
congress
didn't
say
in
so
many
words,
in
the
reservations
we're
setting
aside
the
water.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank...
thank
you,
ms.
williams.
your
time
has
expired.
mr.
white,
do
you
have
any
rebuttal?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
ordinarily
we
take
the
word
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
over
the
district
court
unless
it's
some
obvious
mistake.
did
the
supreme
court
of
wyoming
look
at
it
differently
than
the
district
court
did?
chief
justice
rehnquist
they
said
that
there
was
no
finding
below
and
they
were...
that
was
what
they
based
their
statement
on?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
white.
the
case
is
submitted.
