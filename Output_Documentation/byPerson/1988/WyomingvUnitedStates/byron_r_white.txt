justice
white
well,
suppose...
suppose
there
hadn't
been
the
state
rights...
state
water
reservation
rights,
is
your
claim
still
that
the
standard
was
misapplied?
justice
white
yes?
justice
white
okay.
justice
white
mr.
white
why...
why
did
they
relinquish?
justice
white
why
did
they
relinquish
these
state
rights?
justice
white
is
that
in
idaho?
justice
white
there
was
some...
i
take
it
if...
historically
how
many
acres
had
been
irrigated?
justice
white
about
54,000?
well,
that's
evidence
of
need.
if
they're
using
that
land
for
agriculture
and
had
been
using
water
to
raise
crops,
i
suppose
that's
some
evidence
of
need.
justice
white
all
right.
justice
white
so
you
say
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
need
that
hasn't
been
satisfied?
justice
white
all
right.
justice
white
and
i
suppose
the
pia
standard
just
assumes
that
you're
allotting
water
for
irrigation?
justice
white
for
agriculture.
justice
white
well,
it
certainly...
it
certainly
doesn't
measure
the...
the
water
needs
for
any
other
purpose.
justice
white
well,
let's
just
assume,
though,
that
it
was
just
an
ordinary
case
like
in
arizona.
we
decided
what
the...
how
much
water,
based
on
this
formula,
and
that's
in
the
decree
now,
isn't
it?
justice
white
and
it's
not
about
to
be
changed,
i
don't
suppose.
justice
white
if
the
indians
need
more
water,
why,
the
united
states
will
have
to
condemn
it.
justice
white
--they
also
relinquished
most
of
the...
an
awful
lot
of
the
water
rights...
state
water
rights
that
were
obtained
for
the
reservation.
justice
white
are
they
using
all
the
water
that's
been
al
located
in
this
proceeding?
justice
white
well,
what's
happening
to
it?
justice
white
well,
have
they...
have
they
attempted
to
obstruct
the
flow
or,
down
the
stream?
justice
white
what
were
they
going
to
use
it
for?
justice
white
well,
i
don't
suppose
that
agreement
binds
us.
justice
white
if
you
go
back
to...
if
you
talk
about
what
the
intent
was
back
in
the
19th
century,
it
would
be
hard
to...
hard
to
think
that
these
projects
would
ever
have
been
contemplated.
justice
white
by
the
way,
what...
what
crops
are
being...
what
crops
are
grown
on
the
reservation?
justice
white
for
sale?
justice
white
--about
those
reservations.
justice
white
well,
there's
no
history
about
those
reservations
in
arizona
i,
like
there
is
here
in
wyoming.
justice
white
well,
you
could
say--
justice
white
--they
are
different
reservations.
justice
white
they're
not
the
same
reservations.
they
are
different
reservations.
justice
white
would
you
agree
then
that
necessity
enters
into
this
calculation?
justice
white
there
is
no
argument
in
this
case
about
how
much
water
is
necessary
to
irrigate
an
acre?
justice
white
do
we
usually
get--
--you
don't
want--
--excuse
me--
--you
don't
want
the
reserved
right
to
ever
be
subject
to
diminution
for
non-use?
justice
white
well,
it
doesn't
have
to
be.
justice
white
it
certainly
doesn't.
justice
white
well,
it
doesn't
have
to
be.
if
water
is
scarce
and
nobody
is
using
it--
justice
white
--i
mean,
under
most...
under
most
state
laws
you
either
use
it
or
lose
it.
justice
white
if
there
is
anything
that
is
created
under
certainty
around...
in
the
water
business
in
the
western
states,
it's
this
whole
process
of
quantifying
the
reserved
right.
justice
white
well,
it
hasn't
been
quantified
yet
with
wyoming.
justice
white
but
you
would
never...
you
would...
once...
your
suggestion
is
that
if
we
set...
once
the
reserved
right
is
established
with
a
priority
date
of
1868,
there
is
never
any
other
water
right
going
to
take
precedence
over
that.
justice
white
what
is
the
indian
population
on
the
reservation?
justice
white
what
was
it
in
1868?
do
you
know?
justice
white
do
you
think
the...
do
you
think
the
reserved
right
should
incorporate
or
should
be
used
to
maintain
instream
flows?
justice
white
mr.
white,
suppose
these
were
all
state
water
rights
that
had
been
involved
here
and
they
weren't
being
used
completely
and
the
water
that
wasn't
being
used
flows
on
down
the
stream.
suppose
they
wanted
to
use
the
water
for
something
else,
would
the
junior
appropriators
down
below
have
a
valid
objection?
justice
white
well,
we
don't
know
whether
that's
different
or
not.
justice
white
but
does
every...
does
every
state
have
a
mechanism
for
saying
if
you
don't
use
your
water
right,
you
lose
it?
justice
white
but
it
takes
some
time,
though,
doesn't
it?
