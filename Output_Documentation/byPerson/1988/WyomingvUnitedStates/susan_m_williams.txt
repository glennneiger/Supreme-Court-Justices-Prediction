ms.
susan
m.
williams
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
the
time
permits
me
today,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
just
two
points.
first,
the
natural
understanding
of
the
treaty
at
issue
in
this
case
is
that
the
united
states
and
the
shoshones
reserve
sufficient
water
to
irrigate
all
of
the
reservations.
that
is,
their
permanent
homes,
farmable
land
for
both
the
present
and
for
the
future
generations.
this
vested
property
right
cannot
now
be
easily
discarded
or
replaced
without
clear
and
unambiguous
congressional
abrogation.
second,
water
quantification
standards
other
than
the
pia
standard
either
legally
or
infirm
because
they
take
the
future
out
of
the
winters
doctrine,
as
is
the
case
with
the
proposed
historically
irrigated
acreage
standard,
or
they
do
not
achieve
the
fixed
present
determination
of
indian
water
rights
long
mandated
by
this
court.
moreover,
any
standard
other
than
pia
simply
is
not
fair
or
just
in
light
of
the
historic
and
the
present
conditions
on
the
wind
river
reservation.
before
the
treaty
and
the
reservation's
creation,
the
shoshones
hunted
and
fished
in
what
are
now
three
western
states.
after
the
treaty,
the
shoshone
agreed
to
live
in
a
very
much
diminished
land
area
although
this
still
is
the
third
largest
reservation
in
the
country.
they
would
subsist
primarily
on
agriculture.
no
evidence
exists
anywhere
in
this
case
that
the
great
chief
washike
in
1868
failed
uncharacteristically
to
consider
the
needs
of
all
of
his
people,
both
the
future
generations
as
well
as
the
present
generations
when
he
reserved
lands
in
the
best
water
area
of
wyoming.
the
only
way
to
have
considered
both
the
present
and
the
future
generation's
needs
for
water
was
to
reserve
at
least
the
water
necessary
to
farm
the
reservation's
farmable
land.
in
1908
this
court
in
winters
recognized
that
when
reservations
were
set
aside,
water
was
set
aside
for
all
time.
in
1963
this
court
in
arizona
against
california
i--
ms.
susan
m.
williams
--that's
correct.
it
is
this
court's
reading
of
the
implied
intent
of
congress,
and
indeed
the
implied
intent
of
the
indians,
as
the
tribes
submit,
is
that
they
would
set
aside
land
and
sufficient
water
to
farm
all
of
that
much
diminished
reservation
after
having
prior
to
that
time
having
economic
opportunities
to
hunt
and
fish
in
a
vast
public...
vast
domain
out
west.
in
1963
this
court
in
arizona
against
california
concluded
that
the
only
feasible
and
fair
way
to
achieve
that
fixed
present
determination
of
indian
agricultural
water
for
present
and
for
future
indian
needs
since
population
increases
are
difficult
to
predict,
is
the
pia.
ms.
susan
m.
williams
the
current
indian
population
on
the
wind
river
indian
reservation
is
about
5,400
indians.
ms.
susan
m.
williams
we
are
not
clear,
but
it
was
something
much
smaller
than
that
size
there.
but,
again,
in
1868
the
chief
of
the
shoshones
had
in
mind
to
protect
and
to
reserve
water
not
only
for
the
then
xx.
water
proviso
that
authorized
the
expenditure
from
the
remainder
of
$85,000
after
a
per
capita
payment
was
to
be
made
to
the
indians
is
such
clear
and
unambiguous
congressional
intent
to
divest
the
property
right,
the
water
right,
that
was
set
aside
in
1868.
this
just
makes
no
sense
at
all
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
$85,000
was
the
tribe's
money.
that
was
money
set
aside
from
the
receipts
of
the
land
sales
in
the
open
area
of
the
reservation.
the
vast
portion
of
that
was
to
be
spent
on
a
per
capita
distribution
to
the
tribal
members
at
that
time.
only
the
remainder,
said
the
united
states,
could
be
used
to
purchase
state
water
permits
for
the
reservation
at
a
time
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
1908
when
there
was
uncertainty
as
precisely
the
scope
of
the
federal
reserve
water
right,
and,
indeed,
the
quantification
of
it.
any
standard
against
this
backdrop
of
an
1868
right,
a
1905
act
statue
by
congress
that
does
not
clearly
divest
that
right,
as
required
by
this
court,
that
would
serve
as
a
substitute
for
the
pia
standard,
as
wyoming
submits,
must
be
premised
on
the
need
for
future
water.
that
is
legally
unsound.
it
is
blind
to
present
facts,
and
it
grossly
distorts
history.
the
need,
the
equities,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
cappaert
unanimously
in
1976,
are
not
to
be
balanced
in
determining
the
scope
of
federal
indian
reserve
water.
though
not
legally
relevant,
wyoming
suggests
that
the
tribes
nave
had
ample
opportunity
to
demonstrate
the
amount
of
water
needed
for
this
reservation,
ignoring
utterly
that
over
the
last
80
years
the
federal
government
has
funded
irrigation
projects
at
wind
river
and
throughout
the
west
primarily
for
the
benefit
of
non-indians.
a
bias
described
in
1973
by
the
national
water
commission
as
one
of
the
sorrier
chapters
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
government's
treatment
of
indian
tribes.
this
federal
bias
is
starkly
in
evidence
at
wind
river.
over
$70
million
has
been
spent
on
irrigation
projects
that
benefit
primarily
the
non-indians.
only
$4.4
million,
in
contrast,
has
been
expended
by
the
united
states
government,
for
the
indian
irrigation
projects.
in
these
circumstances,
the
state
simply
cannot
in
good
faith
argue
that
the
tribes
have
had
ample
opportunity
to
demonstrate
their
need
for
water.
the
indians'
need
for
water
in
this
case
now
should
come
as
no
surprise
to
the
state.
in
1905
the
united
states,
as
a
pre-winters
precaution,
obtained
permits
for
about
125,000
acres
of
land
for
indian
irrigation.
indeed,
before
trial,
the
state
argued
102,000
acres
on
this
reservation
were
pia.
the
simple
fact
is
these
tribes,
under
any
standard,
need
the
water
awarded
to
them
by
the
wyoming
supreme
court,
which,
as
we
have
shown
in
our
briefs,
is
a
modest
award
considering
the
amount
of
acres
per
tribal
member
now
and
over
time
that
can
be
irrigated
with
this
award.
agribusiness
represents
the
only
certain
hope
for
this
tribe's
sustained
economic
future
on
this
reservation.
this
reservation
is
large,
but
it
is
remote,
and
it
has
considerable
available
land.
its
only
other
natural
resource
is
oil
and
gas.
it
is
depleting
very
rapidly.
with
70
percent
of
the
tribal
members
unemployed,
expanded
agriculture
and
related
businesses,
even
if
only
as
subsistence,
can
make
a
real
difference.
the
tribe...
the
shoshone
tribe
recently
executed
a
contract
to
sell
all
of
the
barley
it
can
produce.
in
addition,
many
tribal
members
are
cattle
producers,
but
due
to
the
lack,
of
grasses
to
feed
their
cattle
through
the
winter,
they
currently
sell
those
calves
at
less
than
half
the
weight
the
cattle
industry's
experience
shows
is
where
the
major
profit
lies.
only
through
expanded
agriculture
now
on
the
presently
idle
and
the
future
lands
to
produce
a
winter
feedstock...
the
natural
grasses
on
the
reservation
are
not
on
the
winter
pastures...
will
the
cattle
industry
on
the
reservation
be
able
to
thrive.
in
short,
by
any
definition,
the
tribes
in
this
case
need
their
future
water.
for
the
first
time
in
their
history,
the
shoshone
and
the
arapaho
tribes
are
poised
to
build
a
sustained
and
productive
reservation
agricultural
economy.
this
is
what
their
ancestors
envisioned
in
1868
and
what
the
tribes
must
do
in
1989
to
alleviate
staggering
unemployment
and
poverty-related
social
ills
on
this
reservation.
not
only
will
the
tribal
people
benefit
from
this,
but
so
will
the
regional
economy
as
dollars
flow
off
the
reservation
for
machinery,
retail,
and
for
other
purposes.
ms.
susan
m.
williams
the
reserved
right
that
was
set
aside
in
1868
was
to
be
primarily
for
agricultural
purposes.
but
what
the
indians
intended
impliedly
in
1868
was
to
have
water
sufficient
to
live
on
that
reservation
for
all
time.
we
would
argue
that
the
shoshones
and
the
arapahos
should
not
be
subject
to
any
restrictions
as
to
transfer
of
uses
because
no
other
water
rights
holder
in
this
country
is
so
similarly
restricted.
if
the
need
for
water
in
the
short-term
is
for
uses
other
than
agriculture,
we
would
submit
that
the
tribes
should
not
be
restricted
from
doing
so.
