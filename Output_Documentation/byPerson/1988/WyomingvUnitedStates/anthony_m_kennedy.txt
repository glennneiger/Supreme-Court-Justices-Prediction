justice
kennedy
but
as
i
understand...
as
i
understand
justice
scalia's
question
and
your
answer,
you
would
fix
in
this
decree
for
all
time
the
amount
of
water
to
which
the
indians
are
entitled
based
on
your
present
understanding
of
congressional
intent?
justice
kennedy
and
that
would,
so
far
as
you're
concerned,
be
a
binding
adjudication
for
all
time?
justice
kennedy
well,
i...
the
only
further
question
i
have
is,
what,
then,
is
the
relevance
of
what
happens
after
1905
if
we're
trying
to
determine
the
intent
as
of
1905?
justice
kennedy
and
as
of
what
date
is
the
standard
or
the
projection
made?
what
was
reasonably
anticipated
in
1905
or
today?
justice
kennedy
now,
you
had
three
reasons
to
use
current
technology.
it
was
done
in
arizona
i.
there
is
feasibility
of
proof.
and
then
is
there
a
third
reason?
justice
kennedy
but
the
pia
standard
as
set
in
the
master's
report
in
arizona
i,
isn't
that
a
legal
principle?
do
we
usually
defer
to
special
masters
on
legal
principles?
