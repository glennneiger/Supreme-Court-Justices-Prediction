mr.
davis,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
statute?
the
statute
is
one
that
gives
the
consent
of
the
united
states
to
certain
taxation.
supposing
the
united
states
has
not
consented
so
the
statute
just
simply
doesn't
apply,
would
there
be
any
prohibition
against
this
taxation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
those
cases
have
generally
been
repudiated
pretty
much
by
our
later
cases.
