mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
thank
you,
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
statute
at
issue
here,
4
u.s.c.
111,
precludes
states
from
levying
discriminatory
taxes
upon
the
compensation
of
federal
employees.
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question,
i
believe
that
the
last
clause
of
section
111
has
to
be
read
as
an
affirmative
prohibition
upon
discriminatory--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--well,
for...
one
reason
is
the
historical
context
in
which
the
statute
was
passed.
at
that
time,
the
court,
the
year
before,
had
abrogated
the
doctrine
of
intergovernmental
immunity
insofar
as
it
applied
to
federal
taxation
of
state
employees.
this
tax
act
was
designed
to
subject
the
income
of
state
employees
to
federal
taxation.
at
the
same
time
the
court
felt--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--that's
correct.
some
sort
of
reciprocity.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
the
constitutional
doctrine
of
intergovernmental
immunity
precludes
the
states
from
opposing
any
sort
of
discriminatory
tax
on--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--i
think
it
would
be
for
some
of
the
reasons
you
stated
in
your
dissent
in
the
county
of
fresno
case.
i
would
not
note
that
the
court
in
that--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--well,
that's
certainly
the
motivating
force
behind
the
doctrine.
the
federal
government
has
no
representation
in
the
individual
states
and,
therefore,
there's
not
the
usual
sort
of
political
restraint
upon
the
taxing
power
of
the
states.
by
forcing
the
state
to
treat
those
who
deal
with
itself
the
same
as
those
who
deal
with
the
federal
governments,
the
state
is
precluded
from
pursuing
its
own
parochial
interests
at
the
expense
of
the
federal
government.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
yes,
it
would
be
an
unconstitutional
tax.
the
court
has
never
wavered.
the
doctrine
of
intergovernmental--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--well,
we
certainly
believe
we
get
affirmative
mileage
out
of
the
statute,
but
the
constitutional
doctrine,
although
it
has
wavered
considerably
in,
in
the
scope
of
the
doctrine
given
it
to
it
by
the
court,
the
court
has
never
wavered
in
the
basic
principle
that
the
states
are
precluded
from
imposing
a
discriminatory
tax
upon
those
who
deal
with
the
federal
government.
for
example,
in
the
memphis
bank
case
mentioned
by
appellant,
the
state
in
that
case
taxed
federal
obligations
while
exempting
from
taxations
federal
obligations.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
and
that
was
exactly
the
case
in
the
memphis
bank
case
and
in
the
phillips
chemical
case,
as
well
as
in
the
city
of
manassas
case,
which
the
court
summarily
affirmed
last
term.
in
the
memphis
bank
case,
the
court
specifically
noted
that
the
obligations
of
private
entities
were
taxed
to
the
same
extent
as
the
obligations
of
federal
entities.
only
the
obligations
of
state
entities
were
exempted
from
the
taxation.
similarly,
in
the
phillips
chemical
case,
lessees
of
private
property--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--it
was
a
statutory
prohibition
on
discrimination,
but
the
court
specifically
noted
that
it
interpreted
the
statute
to
the
same
extent
as
the
constitutional
doctrine.
so,
the
court
relied
on
constitutional
cases
in
construing
the
scope
of
the
nondiscrimination
principle
in
this
statute.
we
think
that
the
court
should
do
essentially
the
same
thing
here.
there's
no
reason
why
the
nondiscrimination
principle
in
section
111
should
have
any
different
scope
than
the
court
has
given
to
nondiscrimination--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--well,
because
at
the
time
the
statute
was
originally
proposed,
the
states
were
precluded,
under
the
case
of
collector
v.
day
and
dobbins
case,
from
taxing
those
who
dealt
with
the
federal
government
at
all.
the
doctrine
of
intergovernmental
immunity,
as
originally
interpreted,
was
a
very
broad
one
which
precluded
states
from
imposing
any
tax
on
the
income
of
those
who
dealt
with
the
federal
government.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
the
statute
was
enacted
in
1939.
the
statute
was
enacted
exactly
three
weeks
after
this
court
decided
in
the
graves
case
that,
in
fact,
federal
taxes...
federal
incomes
were
subject
to
state
taxation.
so,
in
effect,
a
statute
which
had
been
proposed
to
open
up
the
federal
government
to
this
sort
of
taxation,
ended
up
being
merely
a
codification
of
the
court's
decision
three
weeks
earlier.
but
it
was
originally
proposed
in
order
to
have
some
sort
of
parity
because
the
court
had
decided
in
1938
in
helvering
v.
gerhardt
that
state
incomes
were
subject
to
federal
taxation.
and
congress
merely
felt
that
there
should
be
some
sort
of
parity
in
the
two
sorts
of
taxations.
that's
why
the...
that's
why
the
statute
was
proposed.
as
it
ended
up
being
enacted,
it
merely
codifies
the
constitutional
principle
of
nondiscrimination,
which
this
court
stated
last
term,
is
at
the
heart
of
modern
intergovernmental
tax
immunity.
so,
we
would
state--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--it,
it
would
still
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
the...
the
inquiry
would
be
whether
there
are
significant
differences
between
the
two
classes
so
that
they're
not
similarly
situated.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
i
would
say
that
that
would
have
to
be.
the,
the--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--there
has
to
be
a
break--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--now,
michigan
argues,
of
course,
that
retirees
are
not
covered
under
section
111,
that
it
only
applies
to
compensation
of
current
employees.
we
would
say
that
that's
both
wrong
and
irrelevant.
it's
wrong
because
a
pension
is
deferred
compensation
for
services
as
a
federal
employee
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
it's
also
irrelevant
for
the
reasons
explained
that
the
statute
merely
codifies
the
constitutional
principle
which
would
apply
to
the
pensions
of
federal
employees
whether
or
not
they
fell
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
not
completely.
i
mean,
it's
not
an
exhaustive
codification.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
just
as
applied
to
this
specific
group
of
employees
in
the
same
way
that
the
statute
in
memphis
bank
codified
the
constitutional
principle
as
applied
to
federal
obligations.
now,
michigan,
while
acknowledging
that
its
statute
treats
state
employees
more
favorably
for
tax
purposes
than
federal
employees--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--ex-employees.
argues
that
the
tax
is
nonetheless...
that
this
sort
of
discrimination
is
nonetheless
constitutionally
permissible
for
several
reasons.
the
first
is
the
point
justice
stevens
was
inquiring
about
that
the
federal
retirees
are
not
singled
out
for
a
tax
imposed
upon
them
alone.
as
i
noted,
the
court
has
already
unanimously
rejected
that
argument
in
both
the
memphis
bank
case
and
in
the
phillips
chemical
case
in
which
private
parties
dealing
with
the
federal
government,
as
well
as
federal
employees,
were
taxed
in
a
similar
way
whereas
the
state
got
a
special
tax
exemption.
in
both
cases,
the
court
stressed
that
however
it
treats
private
entities,
the
state
cannot
impose
a
heavier
tax
burden
on
those
who
deal
with
the
federal
government
than
on
those
with
whom
it
deals
itself.
the
second
argument
that
michigan
puts
forward
is
that
the
discrimination
is
justified--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--it's
not
clear
from
the
court's
precedents
whether
that
would
be
permitted
or
not.
we
would
argue
that
it
would
constitute
discrimination.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
but
it's
not
memphis.
in
the
county
of
fresno
case,
in
justice
stevens
in
his
dissent
made
an
argument
as
to
why
such
a
tax
would
be
constitutionally
suspect.
the
majority
did
not
have
to
deal
with
that
question
in
that
case,
however,
because
the
court
specifically
found
that
private
parties,
state
employees
and
federal
employees
were
all
treated
in
a
similar
way,
that
there
was
no
discrimination.
i
would
note
that
there
is
one
case
in
1962
in
which
the
court
summarily
affirmed
a
district
court
decision
upholding
a
tax
exemption
given
to
charitable
organizations
that
did
not
apply
to
either
the
states
or
the
federal
government.
and
the
reasoning
of
the
district
court
in
that
case
was
that
the
charitable
organizations,
because
they
have
no
power
to
tax
and
are
dependent
upon
voluntary
contributions,
are
not
similarly
situated
with
the
state
and
federal
governments.
now,
because
that
was
a
summary
affirmance,
it's
not
clear
to
what
extent
the
precedential
value
of
that
would...
would
exist
now.
a
final
argument
that
the
state
of
michigan
makes
is
that
the
economic
burden
on
the
united
states
is
simply
not
sufficient...
significant
enough
to
interfere
with
essential
government
functions.
but
it's
precisely
that
sort
of
amorphous
inquiry
into
the
degree
of
interference
with
governmental
functions
that
has
been
long
since
abandoned
by
this
court
and
has
been
replaced
by
the
principle
of
nondiscrimination,
which
makes
such
an
inquiry
unnecessary.
once
it
is
shown
that
the
state's
system
of
taxation
viewed
as
a
whole
treats
those
who
deal
with
the
states
more
favorably,
no
further
inquiry
is
necessary
into
the
economic
effects
of
the
tax.
simply
put,
the
state
of
michigan
must
make
a
choice.
they
can
tax
both
federal
and
state
pensions,
or
they
can
make
both
federal
and
state
pensions
nontaxable.
but
they
cannot
impose
a
tax
on
federal
pensions
that
does
not
imply
to
state
pensions,
a
tax
that
increases
the
costs
and
decreases
the
revenues
of
the
federal
government
while
simultaneously
decreasing
the
costs
and
increasing
the
revenues
of
the
federal...
of
the
state
government.
it's
precisely
that
sort
of
disparity
in
treatment
that
the
doctrine
of
intergovernmental
immunity
was
designed
to
prevent.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
no,
it
wouldn't
be
the
same
result.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
because
state
pensions
are
subject
to
federal
tax.
if
the
state
increased
its
own
pensions
in
order
to
reflect
the
fact
that
they
are
now
taxed,
they
would
be
subject
to
a
higher
federal
tax
burden.
so,
they
would
have
to
increase
them--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--by
more,
which
means
in
effect
that
what
the
state
is
doing
is
getting
the
federal
government
to
subsidize
its
pensions
through
its
discriminatory
taxation.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
yes.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
nothing
further.
