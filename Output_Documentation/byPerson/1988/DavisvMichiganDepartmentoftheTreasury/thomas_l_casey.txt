mr.
thomas
l.
casey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
michigan
courts
held
that
mr.
davis
is
not
an
employee
within
the
meaning
of
the...
section
111.
we
believe
that
judgment
is
correct
and
should
be
affirmed.
alternatively,
we
believe
that
even
if
he
is
covered
by
this
statute,
the
michigan
classification
system
is
permissible,
because
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
that
statute,
it
is
clear
that
the
only
type
of
discrimination
which
is
prohibited
is
discrimination
which
is
aimed
at
or
which
threatens
the
efficient
operation
of
the
federal
government
itself,
not
the
individual
employee.
finally,
we
submit
that
if
the
constitutional
doctrine
of
intergovernmental
tax
immunity
applies,
the
michigan
classification
is
still
permissible
because
that
doctrine
also,
when
properly
interpreted
according
to
its
constitutional
foundations,
only
prohibits
discrimination
which
substantially
interferes
with
the
federal
government's
activities.
they
are
directed
at
the
sovereigns
not
at
the
individuals.
the
michigan
courts
decided
this
case
on
a
preliminary
statutory
interpretation
question:
is
mr.
davis,
a
retiree,
an
employee
within
the
meaning
of
section
111?
they
found
that
he
was
not.
we
believe
that
decision
is
absolutely
correct.
it
is
consistent
with
the
definition
of
employee
and
annuitant
in
the
civil
service
statutes.
it's
consistent
with
the
definitions
in
the
internal
revenue
code.
it's
consistent
with
definitions
in
the
michigan
income
tax
act
and
the
michigan
administrative
code.
for
those
reasons,
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
if,
however,
the
court
finds
that
mr.
davis
is
deemed
to
be
an
employee
and
may
assert
the
protections
of
this
statute,
we
must
look
further
into
the
background
of
the
statute.
unlike
mr.
davis
and
the
federal
government,
we
submit
that
this
statute
is
more
than
merely
a
codification
of
the
constitutional
principle.
we
believe
when
you
look
at
the,
the
congressional
history
and
the
context
of
the
times
and
the
evolution
of
the
doctrine,
it's
clear
that
the
statute
does
two
things,
both
of
which
are
designed
to
narrow
the
preexisting
constitutional
doctrine
as
it
existed
before
graves.
the
first
thing
the
statute
does
is
it
contains
a
broad
waiver
of
immunity
for
employees,
and
the
other
thing
that
the
statute
does,
it
contains
a
narrow
exception
to
that
immunity
for
taxation
which
discriminates
against
employees
because
of
the
source
of
the
compensation.
as
we'll
show,
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
that
portion
of
the
statute
was
intended
to
preserve
the
immunity
of
the
united
states.
it
was
not
intended
to
preserve
any
immunity
of
the
individual
employee.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
the
only
real
legislative
history
dealing
with
this
aspect
are
the
reports
of
the
senate
and
house
committees,
which
we
have
cited
and
quoted
from
in
our
brief.
the
text
of
the
bills
was
debated
on
the
house
and
senate
floors,
but
there...
there
was
no
debate
that
i've
been
able
to
locate
dealing
with
this
discrimination
question.
those
reports
from
the
house
and
senate
committees
clearly
indicate...
we've
quoted
them
on...
in
our
brief
on
page
34
and
35.
there's
an
extensive
quotation.
it's
from
the
senate
report
pages
11
and
12,
and
the
first
sentence
there
reads:
"the
consent
is
not
intended
to
operate,
nor
could
it
operate,
as
a
consent
to
any
taxation
to
which
as
individuals
these
officers
and
employees
are
entitled
to
object.
"
and
it
goes
on
to
indicate
that
an
individual
employee
may
assert
whatever
individual
constitutional
rights
he
or
she
may
have.
if
mr.
davis
feels
this
classification
in
the
michigan
tax
system
violates
his
own
equal
protection
rights,
he
may
assert
that
as
an
individual.
we
submit
that
it
does
not
violate
those
rights
since
there
is
substantial
rational
basis
for
the
statute.
the
last
line
of
that
quotation
indicates
the
true
extent
of
are...
the
narrowness
of
the
exception
to
the
broad
waiver
of
immunity.
quoting
from
the
senate
and
house
reports,
"to
protect
the
federal
government
against
the
unlikely
possibility
of
state
and
local
taxation
of
compensation
of
federal
officers
and
employees
which
is
aimed
at,
or
threatens
the
efficient
operation
of,
the
federal
government,
the
consent
is
expressly
confined
to
taxation
which
does
not
discriminate
against
such
officers
or
employees
because
of
the
source
of
their
compensation.
"
it's
clear
that
that
narrow
exception
to
the
broad
waiver
of
immunity
was
designed
to
protect
the
federal
government
against
taxation
by
the
states
which
is
aimed
at
or
threatens
the
efficient
operation
of
the
federal
government.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
mr.
davis
can
make
the
allegation,
but
in
order
to
substantiate
coverage
under
this
statute,
it
has
to
be
alleged
and
proven
that
the
discrimination
against
him
has
this
kind
of
substantial
interference
with
federal
activities.
the
statute
has
to
be
found
to
be
aimed
at
or
threaten
the
efficient
operation
of
the
federal
government
itself.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's
correct.
the,
the
statute
itself
by
its
terms
does
not
define
the
word
"discriminate".
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
if
it
could
be
shown,
for
example,
in
this
case
if
the
taxation
effort
against
mr.
davis
was
so
severe
that
the
federal
government
was
its...
the
operations
of
the
federal
government
were
threatened,
that
would
be
sufficient
under
the
statute.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
in
those
circumstances,
it
would
seem
that
that
statute
would
be
clearly
aimed
at
the
federal
government.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
there
would
have
to
be
some
showing
of
the
effect
of
the
statute
on
the
federal
government.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
what...
we
view
the
michigan
system
as
a
classification
which
confers
a
benefit
on
retired
state
employees.
the
rest
of
the
world,
many
millions
of
michigan
taxpayers,
are
all
treated
the
same,
including
the,
the
few
thousand
retired
federal
employees.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
well,
the
first
part
of
the
statute
is
a
broad
exception...
or,
excuse
me...
a
broad
waiver
of
immunity.
at
the
time
the
statute
was
proposed,
the
states
could
not
tax
the
income
of
federal
employees.
this
came
up
while
the
graves
case
was
still
pending.
the
congress
was
aware
that
there
was
a
shift
evolving
in
the
interpretation
of
the
constitutional
doctrine,
but
as
this
legislation
was
proposed,
states
could
not
tax
federal
employees.
the
first
sentence--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--graves
said
that
the
states
can
tax
federal
employees.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's
correct.
so,
we
say...
we
submit
that
the
statute
is
narrower
than
the
constitutional
doctrine.
the
only...
the
statute
prohibits
discrimination
which
is
aimed
at
or
which
threatens
the
efficient
operation
of
the
federal
government.
that
is
the
only
type
of
discrimination
which
the
statute
exempts
from
taxation.
the,
the
statute
consents
to
taxation
of
federal
employees,
but
to
protect
the
federal
government,
there
is
this
exception
for
discriminatory
taxes
which
are
aimed
at
or
threaten
the
efficient
operation
of
the
federal
government.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
if
all
50
states
did
engage
in
this
and
there
was
sufficient
financial
consequences
to
the
federal
government,
then
yes,
there
would
be
a
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
in
this
case
there
was
no--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--well,
we
submit
there
has
to
be
more
than
just
a
mere
threat.
the
graves
case
and...
and
others
indicate
there...
the
harm
to
the
federal
government
cannot
be
mere
speculation.
there
has
to
be
some
kind
of
showing
of,
of
harm.
that...
graves
was
an
economic
burden
case
and
not
a
discrimination
case,
but
we're
arguing,
in
essence,
that
the
discrimination
aspect
should
be
interpreted
substantially
the
same
as
the
economic
burden
aspect.
in
the
phillips
case,
for
example,
upon
which
mr.
davis
relies
very
heavily,
the
court
specifically
said
in...
in
at
least
two
points
in
the
opinion
that
where
taxation
of
the
private
use
of
the
government's
property
is
concerned,
the
government's
interest
must
be
weighed
in
the
balance.
that's
all
we're
asking
the
court
to
do
in
interpreting
this
statute
or
the
constitutional
doctrine:
weigh
the
government's
interests
in
the
balance.
if
the
government's
interests,
as
a
government,
as
a
sovereign
entity,
are
not
harmed
by
the
michigan
statute,
there
is
no
violation
of
the
federal
statute--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--the...
in,
in
phillips
this
court
made
a
specific
finding
that
the
discrimination
did
affect
not
only
the
private
lessee,
but
also
the
federal
government.
the,
the
key
word
in
our
interpretation
here
is
there
has
to
be
discrimination
against
the
private
entity
and
the
federal
government
not
just--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--yes.
there
is
no
allegation
and
no
showing
on
the
facts
of
this
case
that
the
federal
government
suffers
any
adverse
consequences
at
all
from
the
michigan
classification.
had
the
federal
government
come
in
or
had
mr.
davis
alleged
and
shown
some
negative
impact
on
the
federal
government,
we
would
have
a
different
case.
what,
what
we're
asking
the
court
to
do
is
interpret
this
federal
statute
and
the
constitutional
doctrine
in
such
a
way
as
to
say
that
discrimination
is
prohibited...
discrimination
against
an
employee
is
prohibited
only
if
it
has
this
kind
of
substantial
adverse
effect
on
the
government,
not
just
on
the
individual.
they
argue
for
a
broad
interpretation
of
the
constitutional
doctrine.
they
say
that
the
discrimination
is
prohibited
if
it
affects
the
federal
government
or
anyone
with
whom
the
federal
government
deals.
clearly
that
is
too
broad,
we
suggest.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
i,
i
don't,
don't
believe
the
statute
does
say
that.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
we
view
the
statute
as
doing
two
things,
as
i
said.
number
one,
it
is...
it
is
a
very
broad
consent
to
taxation.
it's
a
broad
waiver
of
the
constitutional
immunity
from
taxation
that
individuals
had
at
that
time.
secondly,
it
is
a...
there's
a
narrow
exception
to
that
waiver
in
the
last
sentence
that
we've
quoted
from
the
senate
report.
and
the
only
basis
for
that
exception
is
to
protect
the
federal
government
as
an
entity.
now,
this
dovetails
very
neatly
with
the
economic
burden
cases
involving
the
constitutional
doctrine
where
the
court
has
pointed
out
that
the...
the
whole
basis
for
the
doctrine
is
to
protect
the
integrity
of
two
sovereign
governments.
it's
not
designed
to
protect
in...
individual
employees
from
having
to
pay
a
higher
burden
of
tax.
it's
not
designed
now
under
the
modern
doctrine
to
protect
the
federal
government
from
having
to
ultimately
pay
the
entire
economic
burden.
all,
all
we're
saying
is
that
when
you're
looking
at
an
alleged
violation
of
either
the
statute
or
the
constitutional
doctrine,
the
focus
has
to
be
on
the
impact
on
the
sovereign
entity
of
the
federal
government.
we
believe
that's
consistent
with
the
congressional
history
of
the
statute
and
with
the
constitutional
principles
underlying
the
doctrine
of
intergovernmental
tax
immunity.
the
united
states
in
its
amicus
brief
has
argued
that
there
might
be
some
economic
burden
to
it.
we
submit
that
that
is
pure
speculation.
as
i
understand
their
argument,
they're
saying
if
michigan
taxed
its
state
retirees,
then
if
the
michigan
legislature
raised
the
state
pensions,
then
some
of
that
extra
pension
money
would
go
to
the
federal
government
in
the
form
of
federal
income
taxes.
we
submit
there's
no
guarantee
that
that
would
happen
at
all.
that
is
pure
speculation.
and
graves,
as
we've
quoted
extensively
in
our
brief,
indicates
that
you
cannot
speculate
as
to
the
negative
impact
on
the
government.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
michigan
income
tax
is
4.6
percent.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
well,
it's
kind
of
ironic
here.
if
michigan
did,
as
the
government
hypothesizes...
tax
its
state
employees
and
then
raises
the
pension,
mr.
davis,
the
plaintiff
in
this
case,
would
not
get
any
benefits.
a
hundred
and
thirty
thousand
or
so
state
retirees--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--perhaps,
but...
yes.
but
there
are
some--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--true,
but...
now,
we
don't
have
much
of
a
factual
record
in
this
case,
but
my
understanding
is
that
there
are
about
24,000
retired
federal
employees
in
the
state
of
michigan.
i
assume
they're
interested
in
it,
too.
but
if
michigan
chose
to
tax
its
state
employees...
state
retirees,
then
those
130,000
people
would
suffer.
the
federal
retirees
would
not
gain
anything,
and
the
only
entity
that
would
benefit
would
be
the
united
states
government.
we
submit
that
that's
not
the
appropriate
way
to
look
at
it.
the
appropriate
way
to
look
at
it
is
does
the
federal
government
suffer
now,
not
will
they
get
a
benefit
in
the
future
if
the
situation
changes.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
there
are
approximately
four
and
a
half
million
individual
taxpayers
in
michigan.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
except
for
the
130,000
state
retirees
who
benefit
from
this.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
flat
4.6.
there's
a
michigan
constitutional
prohibition
against
a
graduated
income
tax.
one
other
element
that
the
united
states
has
raised,
it
says
that
it
is
unprotected
from
taxation
efforts
by
michigan.
we
submit
that
that
is
simply
not
the
case.
in
washington
v.
united
states,
this
court's
opinion
said
that
a
political
check
is
provided
when
a
state
tax
falls
on
a
significant
group
of
state
citizens
who
can
be
counted
upon
to
use
their
votes
to
keep
the
state
from
raising
the
tax
excessively
and
thus
placing
an
unfair
burden
on
the
federal
government.
in...
in
this
case,
we
have
four
million,
300
and
some
thousand
michigan
taxpayers
who
are
in
exactly
the
same
situation
as
the
24,000
federal
retirees.
that
we
submit
is
a
significant
group
of
state
citizens
whose
votes
will
protect
the
federal
retirees.
we
have
argued
to
some
extent
in
our
brief
a...
we...
we've
made
an
argument
about
the
appropriate
remedy.
should
we
lose
all
our
substantive
arguments,
we
admit
that
mr.
davis
should
get
his
tax
refund
with
interest,
but
the
question
arises
what
about
these
other
24,000
people.
i've
discussed
that
extensively
in
our
brief,
and
if
the
court
has
no
questions
about
it,
i
don't
propose
to
argue
it
in
detail
here
except
to
say
that
we
suggest
that
the
proper
remedy
would
be
to
remand
the
case
to
the
state
to
let
the
state
courts
or
the
state
legislature
make
the
first
determination
about
whether
the
exemption
should
be
extended
or
withdrawn.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
it's
not
a
class
action,
but--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--if,
it
this
court
issues
an
opinion
stating
that
the
current
michigan
classification
is
unconstitutional
or
in
violation
of
the
statute,
there
are
these
24,000
taxpayers
out
there.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
well,
that...
that's--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--it
is
not
specifically
raised,
no.
we
put
it
in
more
or
less
as
a
preventative
measure
to
indicate
that
if
the
choice
is
between
extending
the
exemption
to
the
federal
retirees
or
withdrawing
it
from
the
state
retirees,
we
would
prefer
extending
it
to
the
state
retirees.
if
i
may
briefly
conclude,
we
suggest
that
mr.
davis
and
the
united
states
in
this
case
are
asking
the
court
for
a
per
se
rule
that
he
as
an
individual
retired
federal
employee
is
entitled
to
every
tax
benefit
that
michigan
law
gives
retired
state
employees,
regardless
of
whether
the
federal
government
as
a
sovereign
entity
suffers
any
adverse
effects
from
the
state
tax
statutes.
we
urge
this
court
to
reject
such
a
per
se
rule
and
