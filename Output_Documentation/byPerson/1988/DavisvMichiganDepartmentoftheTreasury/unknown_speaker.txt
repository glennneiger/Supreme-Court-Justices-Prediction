unknown
speaker
but
you
think
that
even
without
the
statute,
you'd
have
a
claim
based
directly
on
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
because
the
language
of
the
statute
really
doesn't
help
you
at
all.
it
just...
just
says
the
united
states
hasn't
consented,
if
you're
right
on
your
reading
of
it.
but...
but
maybe
what
my...
what
i'm
suggesting
is
maybe
the
consent
of
the
united
states
simply
isn't
necessary
for
this
tax.
unknown
speaker
that's
right,
but
i'm...
i'm
saying...
say
i
agree
with
you
that
there's
no
consent
of
the
united
states,
but
then
you
still
have
to
have
the
second
question
of
whether
the
tax
is
nevertheless
invalid
because
it
violates
the
constitution.
and
for
that
proposition,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
rely
on
some
rather
old
cases.
unknown
speaker
but
the...
but
the
statute
doesn't
contain
any
prohibition.
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
prohibits
anybody
from
taxing
anything.
it
just
says
the
united
states
consents
to
certain
taxes.
unknown
speaker
mr....
mr.
davis,
you
don't
think
you
can
draw
from
the
statute
a
kind
of
a
negative
implication
that
congress
does
not
consent
or
objects,
if
you
will,
to
the
taxation
of
things
that
don't
fall
within
that
definition?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
one
read
the
statute
that
way,
it
would
put
your
case
in
a
better
light
than
just
having
to
rely
on
the
constitutional
provisions,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
that,
mr.
davis?
unknown
speaker
supposing
the
michigan
system
taxed
the...
pensions
of
both
federal
employees
and
state
employees,
but
granted
an
exemption
to
union
workers
in
the
automobile
industry,
something
like
that,
just
an
entirely
different
exemption,
would
that
discriminate
against
federal
employees?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
see,
this
suggestion
i
make
is--
unknown
speaker
--but
does
a
statute
which
discriminates
in
favor
of
a
small
group
of
michigan
citizens
discriminate
against
ex-federal
employees?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
find
that
in
the
language
of
the
statute
either.
unknown
speaker
it
only
refers
to
being
discriminated
against,
and
i'm
not
sure
the
federal
employees
have
been
discriminated
against
here.
there's
a
discrimination
in
favor
of
one
group
of
michigan
citizens.
but
you
say
if
it
was
a
different
group
of
michigan
citizens,
there
would
be
no
violation
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
davis.
mr.
kellogg,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
unknown
speaker
why
does
an
exception
from
a
broad
consent
have
to
be
read
as
an
affirmative
prohibition?
unknown
speaker
it
was
designed
to
increase
the
power
of
the
state
to
tax
federal
employees.
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
so
that
if
you
had
no
statute
here,
what
would
be
the
objection
to
this,
this
tax?
unknown
speaker
but
would
this
be
a
discriminatory
tax
in
my
other
hypothetical
if
they
exempted
automobile
workers'
pensions?
unknown
speaker
that's
quite
different.
that...
right
there
you
are
worried
about
the
electoral
body
there
that
would
discriminate
against
the
federal
employees.
unknown
speaker
but
your
view...
just
to
be
sure
i'm
clear
on
it,
your
view
is
this
would
be
an
unconstitutional
tax
even
if
you
didn't
have
this
statute.
unknown
speaker
so,
my...
my,
my
own
view
is
that
the
government's
position
would
be
much
weaker
here
if
it
has
to
depend
on
just
the
constitution
if
it
can't
get
any
affirmative
mileage
out
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
oh,
yes,
but
this
case
would
be
entirely
different
if
the
only
people
whose
pensions
were
being
taxed
were
federal...
ex-federal
employees.
but
that's
not
this
case.
federal
employees
are
in
the
same
class
as
all
michigan
citizens
except
michigan
employees.
unknown
speaker
but
again,
was
that
not
a
statute
that
contained
a
prohibition?
unknown
speaker
why...
why
should
congress
enact
a
statute
like
this
if
all
it
meant
to
do
was
to
proclaim
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
when
was
this
statute
enacted?
unknown
speaker
let
me...
let
me
take
you
one
step
further.
in...
instead
of
all
michigan
employees,
supposing
it
just
exempted
michigan
police
officers,
but
doesn't
exempt
fbi
agents
who
live
in
the...
in
the
state,
would
it
still
be
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
supposing
it
just
investigated...
it
exempted
michigan
legislators,
but
didn't
invest...
exempt
michigan
congressmen,
do
you
think
that
would
still
make
it
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
assuming
no,
assuming
that
they'd
perform
exactly
the
same
jobs.
but
if
you
just
exempt
one
michigan
employee
who
has
a
counterpart
in
the
federal
system,
the,
the
tax
is
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
it
has
to
be?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that's
what
congress
intended
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
that...
that's
not
logical.
it
doesn't
codify
it
if
it's
different
from
it.
your
first
argument...
it
doesn't
codify
it
if
it's
different
from
it.
if
he's
right
that...
that
it
only
covers
current
employees,
it
does
not
codify
the
constitutional
principle.
unknown
speaker
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
unknown
speaker
xxx
ex-employees.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kellogg,
supposing
in
this
case
the
state
of
michigan
had
said
we're
going
to
tax
michigan
employees
and
federal
employees
on
their
retirement
benefits,
but
we're
not
going
to,
to
tax
private
employees.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
not
phillips
and
it's
not
memphis,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
sort
of
silly,
though,
doesn't
it?
i
mean,
so
they
will
tax
them
both
and
just
increase
the
pensions
for
the
state
workers.
you
get
exactly
the
same
result
as,
as
you
would
get
by
not
taxing
the
state
workers
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
increase
them
a
little
bit
more.
unknown
speaker
and
that's
a
no-no.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
kellogg.
mr.
casey,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
how,
how,
how
do
you
show
that
from
the
legislative
history?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
suggest
from
that
bit
of
legislative
history
that
no
individual
has
a
right,
when
he
is
taxed
in
violation
of
the
provision,
only
perhaps
the
united
states
could
sue?
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
at
all
that
suggests
that.
that
would
be
purely
imported
from
this
sentence
in
the
legislative
history,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
fact,
the
statute
refers
to
discrimination
against
the
officer
or
employee
of
the
united
states,
indicating
a
concern
with
the
individual.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
under
that
view,
they...
you're
saying
it
would...
it
would
be
permissible
for
them,
unless
you
can
make
that
kind
of
a
showing,
to
give
an
exemption
to
every
michigan
citizen
except
federal
employees?
unknown
speaker
without...
but
you
wouldn't
have
to
prove
anything
beyond
the
fact
that
it
discriminated
against
federal
employees,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
why?
i
don't
understand
that
because
in,
in
its
terms
it
would
discriminate
against
federal
employees.
i
thought
your
argument
was
that
this
doesn't
discriminate
against
federal
employees;
it
discriminates
in
favor
of
a
small
group
of
michigan
citizens,
which
is
a
quite
different
argument.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
a
very
different
argument
for
saying...
from
saying
that
mr.
davis
has
to
prove
that
the...
the
operations
of
the
federal
government
are
going
to
grind
to
a
halt
if
they
don't
get
this
exemption.
unknown
speaker
why,
why
should
we
look
at
the
time
when
it
was
proposed?
it
seems
to
me
we
look
at
the
time
it
was
adopted.
at
the
time
congress
adopted
it,
there
was
already...
it
was
already
clear
that...
that
the
states
could
tax
the
federal--
unknown
speaker
--and
graves
came
out
three
weeks
before
the
statute
was
passed,
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
seems
to
me
if
all
50
states
could
engage
in
selective
taxation
of
this
type,
that
there
certainly
is
a
threat
to
the
federal
government
interest.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think--
unknown
speaker
--i
think
it's
the
mere
threat
of
that
under
your
interpretation.
unknown
speaker
but
the
phillips...
phillips
was
a
county
school
tax
in
texas
on
one
leasehold
interest
of
the
government.
certainly
if
you
had
taken
that
by
itself,
you
would
have
said
the
federal
government
isn't
going
to
stand
and
fall
on
whether
that...
it
must
be
the
idea
if
the
practice
became
widespread
or
the
potential
threat,
as
justice
o'connor
says,
not
just
that
one
particular
bit
of
taxation
is
going
to
stop
the
federal
government
in
its
tracks.
unknown
speaker
you,
you
say
in
phillips
that
the
discrimination
was
against
the
government
itself
as,
as
an
owner,
whereas
here
it's
just
against
a
government
employee?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
statute
certainly
says
that.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
it
does?
unknown
speaker
what,
what
is
the
rate
of
the
tax
that
we're
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
so,
in
other
words,
if
they
gave
a
4.6
percent
increase
or
i
guess
the
after-tax
equivalent
of
4.6
percent,
then
that
would
equalize
it.
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
might
be
entitled
to
a
refund
for
the
period
that
the
discrimination
occurred.
unknown
speaker
which
is
probably
what
he's
much
more
interested
in
than
the
future.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
an
idea
of
how
many
taxpayers
there
are
in
michigan?
unknown
speaker
and
they're
all
treated
the
same
as
the
federal
employees.
unknown
speaker
michigan's
income
tax
isn't
graduated
then.
it's
just
a
flat
4--
unknown
speaker
--my,
my
only
question
about
that
question
is
why
that
question
is
here.
is...
is
it
here?
this
is
not
a
class
action,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
so,
why
do
we
have
to
answer
that
at
all?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's...
there
are
other
days
in
the
future
too.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
not...
it's
not
here,
is
it?
is
that
question
here?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
casey.
mr.
davis,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
in
the
phillips
case,
mr.
davis,
it
was
the
government...
the
united
states
was
the
owner
of
the
underlying
leasehold.
so,
i
suppose
you
can
say
it
suffered
damage
by
demonstration
as
soon
as
the
tax
was
imposed.
here
you're
a
degree
or
two
removed
from
that,
the
tax
being
on...
on
your
income
and
not
on
the
government.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock.
