mr.
paul
s.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
of
michigan
in
its
income
tax
taxes
federal
retirement
benefits,
but
exempts
retirement
benefits
paid
to
retirees
from
the
state
of
michigan.
appellant
submits
that
this
different
treatment
constitutes
an
unlawful
discrimination
in
violation
of
the
federal
statute
4
u.s.c.
111.
appellant
is
a
former
federal
employee
and
receives
a
retirement
annuity
under
the
civil
service
retirement
act.
for
the
year
1979
and
succeeding
years,
appellant,
in
compliance
with
the
michigan
income
tax
law,
paid
michigan
income
tax
on
his
retirement
benefits.
after
the
decision
of
this
court
in
memphis
bank
&
trust
company
v.
garner,
which
was
in
1983,
appellant
filed
amended
returns
for
several
years,
starting
in
the
year...
tax
year
starting
in
1979
and
sought
refunds
of
the
income
taxes
which
he
had
paid
on
his
federal
retirement
benefits.
the
michigan
commissioner
of
revenue
denied
the
requested
refunds.
appellant
then
filed
a
suit
in
the
michigan
court
of
claims
seeking
a
refund
of
those
taxes.
the
court
of
claims
ruled
against
appellant,
and
appellant
then
appealed
to
the
michigan
court
of
appeals.
in
the
court
of
claims
and
the
michigan
court
of
appeals,
appellant
relied
on
the
federal
statute,
4
u.s.c.
111,
taking
the
position
that
the
michigan
law
discriminated
against
federal
retirees,
as
compared
with
state
retirees,
in
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
paul
s.
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
s.
davis
yes,
your
honor.
the
constitutional
principles
would
then
apply.
mr.
paul
s.
davis
of...
of
course
at
the
time
the
statute
was
initiated,
there
was
intergovernmental
tax
immunity--
mr.
paul
s.
davis
--which
would
have
exempted
the
retirement
benefits.
mr.
paul
s.
davis
well,
the
graves
case,
which
i
was
going
to
mention,
at
the...
which
was
pending
at
the
time
the
public
salary
tax
act
was
being
considered
in
1939,
and,
and
the
graves
case
for
the
first
time
held
that
all
state...
all
federal
salaries
would
be
subject
to
taxation
by
the
federal
government,
provided
that
the
tax
was
nondiscriminatory.
mr.
paul
s.
davis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
s.
davis
well,
the
consent
of
the
united
states
was
conditioned
upon
the
tax
being
nondiscriminatory
and--
mr.
paul
s.
davis
--well,
your
honor,
in,
in
this
case
i've
taken
the
position
that
since
the
statute
applies,
it's
not
necessary
to
consider
the
constitutional
question,
but
the
constitutional
question
is
important.
mr.
paul
s.
davis
well,
it
has...
it
should
be
read
i
think
in
the...
in
the
light
of
the
law
at
the
time
the
statute
was
initiated,
and
at
that
time
the
federal
salaries
were
exempt
from
state
taxation
and,
and
it
was
only
as
a
result
of
this
statute,
together
with
the
graves
case
which,
in
effect,
reached
the
same
result,
that
the
federal
compensation
was
made
taxable
by
the
state.
and
the
graves
case
made
clear
that
any
such
taxation
must
be
nondiscriminatory
which,
of
course,
was
what
the
statute
also
said.
mr.
paul
s.
davis
well,
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
the
statute
by
implication
says
that
it
consents
to
the
taxation
if
the
tax
is
nondiscriminatory,
but
does
not
consent
if
the
tax
is
discriminatory.
mr.
paul
s.
davis
yes,
sir.
i
think
the
two
should
be
read
together.
in,
in
other
words,
the
constitutional
provision
is
important
in
defining
what's
meant
by
nondiscriminatory
as
in
the
light
of
intergovernmental
tax
relations
between
the
federal
and
state
governments.
the
memphis
bank
&
trust
case
in...
involved
a
somewhat
similar
situation
in
the
context
of
taxation
on
banks
as
distinguished
from
taxation
on
employees.
and
in
that
case,
the
state
of
tennessee
taxed
bank
earnings
under
a
formula
where
earnings
from...
which
in...
included
interest
on
federal
securities
but
excluded
interest
on
state
securities.
and
this
court
held
that
that
was
invalid.
and
we
had
the
same
situation
in
michigan,
and
michigan
had
to
make
refunds
of
substantial
amounts
to
michigan
banks
as
a
result
of
that
decision.
the
public
salary
tax
act,
as
i
say,
was
pending
at
the
time
the
graves
case
was
decided.
the
state
of
michigan
takes
the
position
that
4
u.s.c.
111
applies
by
its
terms
only
to
present
federal
officers
and
employees,
and
the
state
asserts
that
appellant
is
a
retiree
and
not
a
federal
employee,
which
of
course
is
conceded.
but
the
statute
is
not
limited
to
compensation
of
present
employees.
it
expressly
covers
pay
or
compensation
for
personal
services
as
an
officer
or
employee
of
the
united
states.
appellant
submits
that
his
compensation
is
clearly
part
of
his
compensation
as
a
federal
employee
and
the
cases
which
we've
cited
in
our
brief
show
that
the
courts
consider
retirement
compensation
as...
or
retirement
benefits
as
deferred
compensation.
and
one
of
the
cases
refers
to
the
federal
retirement
system
as
a
deferred
compensation
plan.
the
brief
of
the
national
association
of
retired
federal
employees,
filed
as
an
amicus
brief
in
this
case,
discusses
the
legislative
history
of
the
retirement
act,
and
spells
out
various
statements
by
the
sponsors
of
that
act
indicating
that
the
retirement
benefits
are
considered
part
of
compensation
and
are
matters
of
right
and
not
matters
of
grace.
and
the
treasury
regulations
which
were
enforced
before
1933
also
treated
compensation...
treated
retirement
benefits
as
compensation.
they
also
exempted...
specifically
exempted
retirement
benefits
of
state
employees
during
that
period,
and
that
of
course
was
in
accordance
with
the
intergovernmental
tax
immunities,
which
started
with
mccullogh
v.
maryland.
the
michigan
income
tax
clearly
discriminates
against
federal
retirees.
mr.
paul
s.
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
s.
davis
no,
sir.
well,
it
might
conceivably
raise
questions--
mr.
paul
s.
davis
--[inaudible]
laws,
but
not
so
far
as
this
statute
or
intergovernmental
tax
immunities
are
concerned
because
they're
not
treating
the
state
on
the
basis
different
from
the
federal
government.
mr.
paul
s.
davis
no,
sir,
not
unless
it
gives
a
benefit
to
the
state,
as
distinguished
from
the
federal
government.
mr.
paul
s.
davis
well,
the
statute
of
course--
mr.
paul
s.
davis
--well,
unless
they
bear
some
relationship
to
the
state.
in
other
words,
this,
this
is
an
attempt
to
favor
the
state
as
compared
with
the
federal
government,
which
is
a
violation
of
the
statute
and
also
the
constitution.
appellant
urges
that
this
court
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
order
that
refunds
be
made
of
the
taxes
in
question
in
this
case.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
paul
s.
davis
if
the
court
please,
the
argument
with
respect
to
the
scope
of
the
statute...
the,
the
state
takes
the
position
that
present
employees
are
not
covered.
but
the
present
retirees
who
are
no
longer
present
employees
are
not
covered.
but
the
statute
does
not
limit
the
scope
to
present
employees
because
it
says...
refers
to
compensation
for
personal
services
as
an
officer
or
employee.
and
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
this
is
deferred
compensation.
so,
it's
our
position
that
this
is
clearly
within
the
scope
of
the
statute.
now,
with
respect
to
the
adverse
effect
on
the
united
states
government,
both
in
the
phillips
case
and
in
the
memphis
bank
case,
the
objections
were
made,
in
one
case
by
the
landowner
or
lessee,
in
the
other
case
by
the
bank,
not
by
the
government
itself.
and
those...
those
cases
demonstrate
that
once
discrimination
is
shown,
that
is
the
end
of
the
inquiry.
it's
not
necessary
to
show
a
specific
damage
or
economic
effects
to
the
government
itself.
and
that's
the
reason
for
the...
in
effect,
a
blanket
ban
on
discrimination
against
the
federal
government.
mr.
paul
s.
davis
well,
it's
a
difference
of
degree,
but
still
the...
the
impact
was
on
somebody
dealing
with
the
united
states,
just
as
retirees
are
people
who
are
former
employees
of
the
government
who
deal
with
the
government.
so,
it's...
the
same
principle
should
be
applicable.
now,
a
question
was
raised
about
this
overall
impact.
now,
there
are
several
other
states.
in
appellant's
brief
mention
was
made
of
the...
i,
i
guess
it
may
have
been
the
jurisdictional
statement.
mention
was
made
of
the
fact
that
the
state
of
virginia
and
the
state
of
georgia
have
similar
statutes.
and
the
brief
of
the
national
association
which
intervened,
which
has
appeared
as
an
amicus,
also
mentions
the
states
of
arizona,
new
york
and
arkansas
as
being
states
which
have
similar
statutes.
so,
it
may
have
a
broad
effect
in
that
way.
i
don't
think
that's
particularly
relevant,
but
since
the
court
asked
about
it,
i
thought
it
might
be
mentioned.
with,
with
respect
to
the
remedy,
as
has
been
pointed
out,
appellant
takes
the
position
he's
entitled
to
a
refund
of
the
taxes
which
he
has
paid.
and
for
the
future,
it
is
up
to
the
state
to
decide
whether
it
should
extend
the
exemption
to...
given
by
the
state
to
its
retirees
to
all
federal
retirees,
or
whether
the
state
should
tax
both
its
own
and
federal
retirees
which
is
done
by
some
other
states.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i...
i
have
nothing
further.
