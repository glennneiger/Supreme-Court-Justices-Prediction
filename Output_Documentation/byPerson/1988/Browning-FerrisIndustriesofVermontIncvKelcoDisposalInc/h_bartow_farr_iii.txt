mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
think
it
would
be--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
position
today
rests
on
two,
i
think,
relatively
straightforward
propositions.
first
of
all,
that
the
excessive
fines
clause
of
the
eighth
amendment
does
not
apply
to
damages,
punitive
or
not,
awarded
in
private
state
court
tort
actions.
second,
that
in
any
event
there
is
no
basis
in
the
eighth
amendment,
or
otherwise,
for
the
sort
of
intrusive
second-guessing
of
jury
verdicts
the
petitioners
propose.
now,
before
turning
to
the
eighth
amendment,
i'd
like
to
just
point
out
briefly
the
context
in
which
this
claim
arises.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
not
whether
there
should
be
any
judicial
review
of
punitive
damage
awards.
state
law
commonly
provides
for
such
review
and
punitive
damage
awards
are
routinely
reduced
under
such
standards
or
sometimes
set
aside
altogether.
the
reason
that
the
eighth
amendment
is
pressed
in
this
case
and
in
this
court,
when
it
was
just
an
afterthought
in
the
courts
below,
is
that
the
courts
below
upheld
this
award
under
the
traditional
common
law
standards.
now,
turning
to
the
eighth
amendment
issue,
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
before
this
court
adopts
a
constitutional
rule
that
will
be
imposed
on
50
state
tort
systems
that
the
constitutional
basis
for
that
rule
should
be
clear
and
fully
supportive.
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
that
standard
is
anywhere
but
close
to
being
met
in
this
particular
case.
what
is
absolutely
clear,
in
fact...
and
i
think
really
not
open
to
dispute...
is
that
in
800
years
of
history
under
the
amercements
clause
of
the
magna
carta,
the
excessive
fines
clause
of
the
english
bill
of
rights
and
the
excessive
fines
clause
of
the
eighth
amendment
no
court
has
ever
held
that
any
of
these
provisions
applied
to
damages
awarded
in
suits
between
one
private
litigant
and
another.
the
reason
is
that
damages,
the
payments
between
private
litigants
as
part
of
their
remedies,
are
simply
not
fines,
as
that
term
was
commonly
thought
of
and
used
in
1789
and
in
1689.
nor,
are
payments
between
private
litigants
amercements,
as
that
term
was
generally
known
in
the
13th
and
later
centuries.
i
think
it's
very
important,
to
understand
this
fact
because
there
is
some
slippery
history
here.
fines
and
amercements
were
always
demanded
by
and
paid
to
the
government.
of
course,
in
england
the
government
typically
was
represented
by
the
crown,
sometimes
by
a
feudal
lord
to
which
the
crown
had
sold
off
the
right
to
demand
amercements.
but
in
every
instance,
fines
and
amercements
were
penalties
demanded
by,
and
paid
to,
what
we
would
now
think
of
as
government.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
i
think
those...
to
begin
with,
i
think
those
are
not--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--specifically
the
concerns
at
which
these
particular
provisions
are
aimed.
but
there
is
a
situation
where
the
private
party
maybe
stands
more
closely
in
the
shoes
of
the
government
itself.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
because
i
think
what
you've
done
then
is
you've
not
only
taken
the
language
out
of
context,
which
are
fines
and
amercements...
which,
again,
i
don't
think
at
any
time
has
been
thought
to
relate
to
damages...
but
i
think
you've
taken
the
provision
out
of
historical
context
and
out
of
the
context
of
the
evils
at
which
these
particular
provisions
were
aimed.
the
concern
with
the
amercements
clause
and
the
concern
of
the
excessive
fines
clause
is
not
with
fines
in
general,
but
with
the
incentive
of
the
crown,
in
particular,
to
demand
excessive
fines.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
but
that
is
not
in
fact--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--i'm
not
sure
that
i
think
it
is,
your
honor.
i
think
if...
it
is
possible,
i
suppose,
that
you
might
fit
it
within
the
definition.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
think
if
you...
i
guess
my
position,
justice
scalia,
is
if
you
are
going
to
go
outside
what
is
normally
thought
of
as
a
situation
in
which
a
fine
is
imposed,
which
is
when
the
government
brings
the
proceedings,
selects
the
individual,
brings
its
prosecutorial
forces
to
bear
on
that
individual,
and
in
fact
keeps
the
money...
that
is
the
traditional
notion
of
what
a
fine
is.
now,
what
you
have
done
is
to
take
out
one
of
those
elements
and
say
some
of
the
money
is
going
to
someone
else.
my
own
personal
feeling
is
that
is
not
enough
to
bring
that
kind
of
proceedings
into
the
category
of
fines.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
think
in
that
particular
situation,
again,
that
perhaps
brings
it
somewhat
closer.
and,
of
course,
i
will
state
the
obvious,
that
that
is
not
the
situation
in
this
particular
case.
but,
the
concern
still
is,
though,
is
there
any
real
incentive
for
the
state
in
that
situation
to
be
seeking
excessive
fines
or
damages
in
particular
of
the
sort
that
was
the
concern--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
it
is
possible.
i
mean,
i
think
that
given
the
particular
situation
in
states
these
days
that--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--they
serve
a
penal--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--they
do
serve
to
deter
and
to
punish.
i
don't
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
but
they
occur
in
a
wholly
different
setting.
and
that
is
the
point
that
i'm
trying...
trying
to
make.
the
fact
is
that
to
some
extent
compensatory
damages
in
private
tort
suits
serve
the
functions
of
deterring
and
punishing.
i
mean,
there
is
a
reason,
for
example,
that
the
particular
defendant--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--pays
the
damages.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
there
is
a
particular...
you
could
make
the
plaintiff
whole
by
having
insurance.
there
is
a
reason
that
the
states
choose
to
make
plaintiffs
whole
through
a
proceeding
which
forces
the
wrongdoer
to
pay
the
amount
that
is
necessary
to
make
the
plaintiff
whole
often
well
in
excess
of
actual
economic
injury.
and
that
is
because
the
use
of
the
tort
system
does
serve
to
punish
and
deter
conduct
which
the
state
regards
as
unacceptable.
even
in
compensatory
damages.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
let
me
say--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
i
agree
that
it
can
be
a
concern.
but
let
me
address
the
question
that
i
think
we
are
talking
about
immediately,
which
is
whether
this
is
the
kind
of
concern
that
draws
into
play
something
like
the
excessive
fines
clause.
the
reason
that
the
excessive
fines
clause
was
used
to
express
the
concern
of
the
citizenry
in,
let's
say,
1689,
which
was
the
predecessor
of
the
one
in
our
eighth
amendment,
is
because
the
government
itself
had
an
interest
in
the
fines
being
excessive.
the
government
was
using
the
fines
for
several
purposes.
first
of
all,
to
raise
revenues
at
a
time
when
the
king
was
relatively
impoverished.
but,
more
importantly,
to
punish
its
political
enemies.
so
that
the
king
had
an
interest
not
just
in
fines
being
levied,
but,
indeed,
having
the
fines
be
as
excessive
as
they
could
possibly
be
in
order
to
either
imprison
a
defendant
who
couldn't
pay
or
impoverish
one
who
was
fined
to
the
full
extent
of
his
property.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
with
due
respect,
i
think
the
parallel
you've
drawn
is
right,
but
i
think
it's
the
incorrect
parallel.
the
fact
is
that
it
is
the
concern
about
the
government
abuse...
that
is
what
the
constitution
is
typically
aimed
at.
not
concerns
about
what
attorneys
says
for
private
litigants
in
private
disputes.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
justice
kennedy,
i
would
suggest
that
the
difference
is
not
in
the
incentive
of
the
juries.
the
question
is,
it
is
the
incentive
for
abuse
by
government.
the
state
of
vermont
has
no
particular
interest
in
whether
kelco
gets
an
excessive
amount
of
punitive
damages
or
not.
in
fact,
the
state
of
vermont's
view
would
really
be
different
from
the
sort
of
view
that
would
be
expressed
by
the
king
in
common
law.
as
i
said,
the
king
at
common
law
would
like
to
have
damages
or
fines...
because
that
is
what
the
king
is
seeking...
would
like
to
have
fines
be
as
large
as
he
can
possibly
have
them
be.
that
makes
them
a
more
effective
punishment.
for
the
state
of
vermont,
if
punitive
damages
are
excessive
within
the
state,
the
state
can
be
expected
to
act
to
respond
to
that
problem.
the
state
has
no
interest
in
punitive
damages
being
more
than
necessary
to
deter
conduct.
if
it
overdeters
conduct,
then
the
state
has
an
interest
in
fact
in
employing
common
law
standards
and
legislative
standards
to
see
that
punitive
damages
are
reduced
again.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
your
honor,
with
all
due
respect,
i
would
suggest
that
the
states
are
more
likely
to
be
interested
in
attracting
businesses
to
the
state
than
they
are
to
be
interested
in
attracting
plaintiffs
to
their
state
court
systems.
i
mean,
i
think
that
the
concern
that
they
would
have
is
that
if
their
system
does
not
regulate
through
imposition
of
common
law
rules
by
the
state
courts
and
ultimately
through
legislative
rules,
as
legislatures
are
now
stepping
in
in
certain
states,
that
that
would
in
fact
create
the
over-deterrence
that
a
state
would
not
want
to
see
have
happened.
but
that
is
different--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--from
the
situation
at
hand.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i'm
sorry,
justice--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--they
are
essentially
the
same
people.
although
i
might
point
out--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--i
might
point
out,
justice
marshall,
that
bfi
constantly
stresses
the
sort
of
notion
that
this
is
to
favor
local
individuals
against
an
out-of-state
corporation.
to
begin
with,
that's
essentially
just
its
own
surmise,
but,
of
course,
one
of
the
supposed
remedies
for
that
is
diversity
jurisdiction.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
and
this
was
a
case
that
was
brought
into
federal
court.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
your
honor,
no.
that
is
not
my
position.
and
please
let
me
make
that
clear.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
what
i
am
saying
is
that--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--oh,
yes,
your
honor.
there
have
been
numerous
judgments
that
have
been
reduced.
they
have
not
been
reduced
under
the
excessive
fines
clause,
and
that
is
the
point
that
i
was
making.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
remittitur
was
sought
but
it
was
denied
because
the
trial
judge
found
that
this
was
not
an
excessive
verdict
but
it
was
a
reasonable
punitive
measure,
in
his
language,--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--for
the
conduct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
was
the
trial
judge
who
heard
the
evidence.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
after
the
jury
returned
its
award,
there
was
a
motion
for
remittitur
in
the
trial
and
the
trial
judge,
which
had
heard
the
same
evidence
as
the
jury
found
that
this
was
not
an
excessive
award
but
was
a
reasonable
punitive
measure
in
light
of
the
conduct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
your
honor--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--i
think
that
is
probably
an
accurate
statement
of
our
position.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
all
right.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
look
at
that
differently,
justice
scalia.
and
let
me
at
least
explain,
if
i
can,
why
i
do.
i
think
there
we
are
not
simply
saying
that
the
role
of
a
court
under
the
constitution
is
to
do
what
i
think
bfi
is
asking,
which
is
just
to
pick
another
number,
a
number
which
is
unspecified
by
bfi,
but
is
apparently
lower
than
$6
million.
what
would
happen
in
that
situation
is
that
you
would
look
at
the
overall
procedures.
whether
in
fact
the
overall
system
of
awarding
punitive
damages,
including
the
legislative
standards
if
any,
the
instructions
given
to
the
jury,
the
process
of
review
by
the
courts,
would
meet
with...
i
believe
that's
a
procedural
due
process
issue.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
your
honor,
let
me
make
three
points,
if
i
may.
first
of
all,
let
me
make
sure
i
stress
that
is
not
a
claim
that
ever
been
raised
in
this
case,
just
to
start
with.
so,
even
if
i
agreed
with
all
you
said,
i
think
that
it
would
make
no
difference
to
the
outcome
in
this
case.
secondly,
however,
i
don't
think
quite
fairly
you
can
say
that
the
way
you
determine
whether
procedural
due
process
has
been
met
is
to
look
at
the
outcome
of
the
process.
if
that
was
true,
then
you
would
open
up
procedural
due
process
claims
in
all
sorts
of
cases
where
i
think
the
court
has
pretty
much
closed
them
down...
where
somebody
comes
in
and
says,
"here
is
what
happened
in
my
case
in
state
court;
this
is
the
result
i
got."
it
couldn't
have
complied
with
due
process.
there
is
no
way
i
could
have
had
a
judgment
like
this
awarded
against
me,
or
some
other
particular
relief
awarded
against
me,
if
the
procedures
had
been
fair.
but
the
court
has
always
said
there
that
you
look
at
the
procedures.
it
may
be
that
in
a
perfectly
fair
system
there
is
an
inexplicable
result.
i
don't
think
this
is
one.
but
that
is
not...
does
not
mean
the
procedural
due
process
itself
has
been
violated.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that's
correct.
that
certainly
should
be
the
goal
of
procedures.
the
only
point
i'm
making,
justice
kennedy,
is
i
don't
think
that
the
analysis
works
backwards.
i
don't
think
you
say
that
a
litigant
comes
in
and
says,
"here
is
the
result
that
i
submit
to
you
as
an
absolute
figure
is
unfair."
for
whatever
reason,
and
therefore
you
should
conclude
from
that
there
is
no
procedural
due
process.
and,
in
any
event,
that
is
not
a
claim
that
bfi
has
made
here.
now,
again,
i
would
like
to
turn
just
for
a
second
to
what
it
is
that
bfi
wants
the
eighth
amendment
to
do
if
it
would
apply
in
this
case.
as
i've
just
discussed,
this
is
not
a
case
about
standards
for
the
jury.
bfi,
quite
properly,
concedes
that
it
did
not
make
any
claim
that
the
jury
should
have
been
instructed
any
differently.
in
fact,
bfi
specifically
said
that
all
it
wanted
was
the
jury
to
be
instructed
in
accordance
with
traditional
vermont
law.
so,
what
bfi
is
really
saying
is
that
the
court
should
simply
make
a
different
finding
of
that
amount
as
a
matter
of
its
own
judgment,
and
in
the
process
of
doing
that,
give
greater
weight
to
certain
factors
which
it
says
that
the
jury
must
have
given
less
weight
to
and
give
some
less
weight
to
factors
that
it
says
the
jury
must
have
given
too
much
weight
to.
that
is
basically
a
rebalancing
test.
now,
the
first
point
i
guess
i
would
make
about
that
is
that
i
really
don't
see
that
that
is
a
proper
function
of
the
eighth
amendment
as
a
general
application
of
that
amendment.
the
court
in
rummel,
for
example,
and
in
solem,
has
made
clear
that
it
is
the
extremely
rare
case
in
which
the
eighth
amendment
would
be
used
to
strike
down
on
constitutional
grounds
a
determination
made
below.
in
those
cases,
of
course,
criminal
sentences.
and
the
court
has
also
made
clear
that
it's
the
rare
case
in
which
even
an
extended
analysis
will
be
necessary.
now,
in
rummel,
in
particular,
the
court
found
that
it
was
constitutional,
without
an
enormously
detailed
analysis,
to
sentence
a
particular
defendant
to
life
imprisonment
for
what
were
three
relatively
small
economic
crimes.
i
simply
don't
understand
the
concept
of
the
eighth
amendment
that
says
that
that
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
is
constitutional
and
that
system
of
review
is
acceptable,
and
yet
says
that
the
eighth
amendment
requires
very
stringent
review
of
an
award
of
damages
for,
let's
say,
fraud
or
business
misconduct
that
involves
a
greater
amount
of
money.
there
is
certainly
nothing
in
the
history
of
the
eighth
amendment
that
i'm
aware
of
that--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
i'm
like
mr.
frey.
i
can't
say
i'm
not
aware
of
a
case
after
rummel.
however,
i
should
point
out,
as
the
court
is
well
aware,
the
court
in
solem
said
that
it
was
not
in
any
sense
overruling
rummel
and
that
rummel
still
stood
for
good
law.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
in
that
situation
i
suppose
that's
true,
although
that
is,
of
course,
not
any
sort
of
analysis
that
was
made
in
rummel.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
nor,
for
that
matter,
your
honor,
was
that
the
analysis
that
was
followed
in
solem.
i
mean,
the
court
did
not
say
in
making
these
determinations
under
the
eighth
amendment,
"we
will
look
at
other
penalties
only
within
the
same
state."
in
order
to
determine
whether
we
think
it
falls
in
or
out
of
the
particular
analysis
it
was
applying.
so,
i
think
in
that
sense
i
agree
with
mr.
frey.
that
the
emphasis
in
solem,
at
least,
was
on
a
standard
that
would
have
to
be
applied
nationwide.
and
i'm
certainly
saying
that
there
is
no...
nothing
that
i
can
see
in
the
history
of
the
eighth
amendment
that
would
call
for
that
sort
of
nationwide
standard
in
a
situation
like
this.
now,
i
would
just
like
to
touch
on
one
or
two
other
brief
points,
if
i
might,
because
i
think
they
do
bear
on
the
question
of
how
the
eighth
amendment
would
apply,
if
it
does.
and
i
repeat
again
that
i
don't
believe
that
it
does.
the
principal
argument
i
think,
as
i
understand
it
made
for
bfi
in
this
situation,
is
that
the
eighth
amendment
does
not
require
the
same
sort
of
deference
to
jury
verdicts
that
it
requires
for
decisions
made
on
sentencing
by
a
judge
within
legislative
guidelines.
i
guess
i
just
have
two
points
about
that.
first
of
all,
the
idea
itself
is
basically
contrary
to
the
constitutional
framework
in
which
jury
determinations
are
given
the
greatest
of
deference
in
most
situations
where
cases
are
properly
before
the
jury.
and
there
isn't
any
question
that
this
is
a
case
that
properly
went
to
the
jury
on
the
issue
of
punitive
damages
and
on
the
amount
of
punitive
damages.
second
and
more
specifically,
though,
i
would
point
out
that
this
is
totally
inconsistent
with
the
history
of
the
excessive
fines
clause
itself
which,
after
all,
is
the
clause
that
bfi
is
invoking
to
get
into
this
in
the
first
place.
the
one
thing
that
is
absolutely
clear
from
the
eighth
amendment,
the
amercements
clause,
whatever
antecedent
you
wish
to
look
at,
is
that
there
was
no
concern
in
addressing
any
of
these
provisions
about
jury
misconduct
or
jury
excessiveness.
indeed,
in
the
13th
century,
the
jury
was
regarded
as
the
principal
safeguard
against
the
sort
of
abuses
that
the
amercement
clause
was
addressed
at.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
your
honor,
i
think
quite
frankly
that
is
its
root.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
don't
know,
your
honor,
to
be
perfectly
honest.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
i
would
feel
i
had
to
know
a
little
bit
more
if
i
was
here--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--representing
the
government
in
a
civil
fines
case.
but--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--that
is
one
of
the
points,
your
honor.
as
you'll
recall--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--from
the
discussion,
i
had--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--several
points
that--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--let
me
say
this.
that
the
court
in
ingraham
said...
and
i
think
correctly
said...
that
the
eighth
amendment
is
properly
interpreted
in
light
of
its
history.
now,
if
that
is
in
fact
applied
to
the
eighth
amendment
excessive
fines
clause,
it
would
apply
strictly
in
criminal
cases.
that
is
what
the
excessive
fines
clause
specifically
was
addressed
at.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
what
i
would
certainly
say
is
that
the
language
of
the
eighth
amendment
fits
more
naturally,
even
with
a
civil
fine,
than
obviously
it
does
with
a
separate
concept
like
damages
which
were
known
at
the
common
law
and
are
used
separately.
in
my
own
view,
if
you
stay
with
the
historical
analysis
which
was
approved
in
ingraham,
you
still
would
not
get
into
the
civil
context.
but
i
do
agree
that
where
the
government
is
using
essentially
its
prosecutorial
power
in
a
civil
context
in
seeking
fines,
that
that
certainly
is
a
closer
analogue
to
what
the
concerns
of
the
eighth
amendment
were
initially.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
your
honor,
i
see
no
particular
reason
to
concede
it
or
not
concede
it
in
this
case.
but
my
feeling
is
that
it
does
not
apply
by
its
historical
terms
to
that.
whether
the
court
felt
that
in
a
particular
situation
a
provision
that
was--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
a
case
from
a
federal
court.
yes.
a
state
law
question
coming
up
from
a
federal
court.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
disagreement
in
the
briefs
that
the
federal
law
governs
not
the
question
of
whether
punitive
damages
should
be
inflicted...
that's
governed
by
state
law...
but
this
sort
of
excessiveness
question.
now,
use
of
the
word
mr.
farr
is
a
shell
game
because
what
he
wants
to
do
is
collapse
compensatory
damages,
which
are
a
completely
different
animal,
with
punitive
damages.
the
concern
of
the
eighth
amendment
is
with
punishments,
and
our
argument
is
addressed
solely
to
the
punitive
part.
the
fact
that
the
courts
have
been
highly
deferential
traditionally
to
compensatory
damages
awards
takes
them,
i
think,
exactly
nowhere.
and,
finally,
i'd
like
to
discuss
this
question
of
the
use
of
the
word
fine...
rather,
the
fact
that
a
fine
is
paid
to
a
private
citizen.
one
of
the
points
i
want
to
mention
is...
and
i
think
it
was
brought
up
in
the
argument...
is
that
this
is
a
problem,
not
a
virtue
of
the
system,
because
you
don't
have
a
neutral
prosecutor
deciding
what
charge
to
bring,
deciding
how
much
to
press
for.
this
is
like
in
young
against
futon,
where
the
court
was
troubled
by
the
idea
of
having
a
self-interested
private
prosecutor.
now,
that
institution
does
exist
and
we're
not
suggesting
that
it
be
set
aside.
we
are
suggesting,
however,
that
it
is
a
concern
that
should
inform
the
court's
decision.
a
hundred
years
ago
in
missouri
pacific
railway
against
humes
the
court
addressed
specifically
this
question
of
who
a
punishment
is
paid
to,
and
we
quoted
it
in
our
brief.
the
court
said
the
additional
damages
being
by
way
of
punishment,
it
is
not
a
valid
objection...
i'm
sorry.
