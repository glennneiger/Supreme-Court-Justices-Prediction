mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
a
$6
million
verdict
inflicted
on
petitioner
bfi
to
punish
it
for
a
purely
economic
tort
that
caused
respondent
kelco
disposal
$51,000
in
actual
damages
is
subject
to
attack
on
the
ground
that
it
is
disproportionate
to
the
wrong
that
bfi
was
found
to
have
committed.
now,
bfi
and
kelco
were
competitors
in
the
roll-off
waste
disposal
business
in
burlington,
vermont
and
for
a
period
of
about
six
months
in
late
1982
and
early
1983
bfi,
which
had
been
losing
market
share
to
kelco,
substantially
reduced
its
prices
in
what
the
jury
found
was
an
effort
to
put
kelco
out
of
business
and
to
secure
a
monopoly
in
the
market.
this
effort
in
fact
proved
unsuccessful.
kelco
maintained
its
market
share.
bfi
soon
raised
its
prices.
and,
eventually
it
was
bfi
that
gave
up,
sold
out,
and
left
the
burlington
market.
in
the
meanwhile,
this
lawsuit
had
been
brought.
the
complaint
charged
an
attempt
to
monopolize
in
violation
of
section
2
of
the
sherman
act
and
in
a
second
count
tortious
interference
with
kelco's
business
relations
in
violation
of
vermont
common
law.
now,
the
same
alleged
misconduct,
predatory
pricing,
underlay
both
causes
of
action.
after
the
jury
found
bfi
liable
on
both
counts,
it
was
asked
to
assess
damages,
and
after
a
hearing
it
found
that
kelco's
injury,
as
i
mentioned,
was
$51,000.
under
the
federal
antitrust
claim,
kelco
was
of
course
entitled
to
three
times
that
amount
together
with
attorney's
fees.
for
the
state
tort,
which,
remember,
involved
exactly
the
same
conduct,
kelco
was
awarded
the
same
$51,000
in
compensatory
damages
and
$6
million
in
punitive
damages.
now,
the
jury,
which
had
before
it
a
sympathetical
local
plaintiff
and
was
being
asked
to
punish
a
large,
impersonal,
out-of-state
defendant,
awarded
this
astronomical
amount
after
a
damages
hearing
in
which
it
was
repeatedly
urged
to
send
the
message
to
houston...
which
is
where
bfi
has
its
corporate
headquarters...
and
was
invited
to
base
its
award
on
bfi's
size,
which
was
detailed
to
it
in
terms
of
annual
income,
revenues,
monthly
revenues,
weekly
revenues,
hourly
revenues.
now,
when
bfi
challenged
the
verdict
as
excessive,
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
it.
and
in
the
course
of
doing
so
they
did
not
undertake
any
careful
analysis
of
the
circumstances
of
the
case
of
bfi's
conduct.
they
simply
upheld
the
award
on
the
basis
of
their
subjective
reactions
that
it
was
not
excessive.
and
in
the
case
of
the
court
of
appeals
essentially
on
the
basis
of
bfi's
wealth.
now,
both
kelco
and
its
amici
speak
at
some
length
about
the
generally
valuable
role
played
by
punitive
damages
in
the
modern
american
legal
system.
and
they
charged
bfi
with
asking
the
court
to
overturn
traditional
state
tort
law.
but
the
court
does
not
have
before
it
any
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
punitive
damages
as
such.
by
and
large,
therefore,
the
impassioned
defense
that
has
been
made
of
the
institution
of
punitive
damages
is
quite
beside
the
point.
there
may
be
many
things
right
or
wrong
with
punitive
damages,
but
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
federal
law
prohibits
excessive
awards
of
punitive
damages.
this
is
a
relatively
recent
phenomenon,
by
no
means
a
traditional
part
of
state
tort
law,
and
little
has
been
said
and
little
could
be
said
to
justify
the
infliction
of
excessive
punishments
on
tort-feasors.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i'm--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
there
are
three
provisions
that...
three
bodies
of
law
or
provisions
of
law
that
could
regulate
the
excessiveness
of
damages
awards
in
tort
cases,
punitive
damage
awards.
one
is
the
excessive
fines
clause
of
the
eighth
amendment
and
certainly
the
one
we
first
think
of
as
being
potentially
applicable.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
intend
to--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--that
was
raised
below.
the
common
law
argument
that
this
is
excessive,
apart
from
the
constitution,
was
raised
below.
the
third
ground
on
which
the
court
could
reach
the
question
whether
the
award
is
excessive
is
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
due
process
argument
as
such
was
not
raised
below.
we
believe,
however,
your
honor,
if
i
can
anticipate
your
next
question,
that
that
is
not
a
reason
why
this
court
could
not
reach
the
due
process
question
if
it
found
that
the
excessive
fines
clause
of
the
eighth
amendment
was
inapplicable.
while
kelco
in
its
brief
has
mentioned
several
times
that
the
due
process
issue
was
not
raised
below,
what
it
has
not
done
is
cite
any
cases
that
indicate
that
that
is
a
detect
that
blocks
the
court
from
ruling
on
that
question.
and,
in
fact,
in
our
reply
brief
we
cited
several
cases,
i
think
city
of
revere,
braniff
airways
against
nebraska,
and
i
think
in
fact
the
instances
are
legion
in
which
the
party
has
cited...
has
made
the
correct
substantive
attack.
that
is,
it
has
identified
specifically
what
its
problem
is
with
what
happened
to
it,
what
it
thinks
is
wrong.
but,
it
has
assigned
the
wrong
provision
of
the
federal
constitution.
in
a
case
like
that,
i
think
the
court
has
felt
free,
if
need
be,
to
reach
the
correct
provision.
essentially
our
claim
is
that
this
award
is
excessive.
it
is
grossly
disproportionate
to
what
was
done
wrong.
we
say
that
violates
the
excessive
fines
clause
of
the
eighth
amendment.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i'm
not
sure
that
i'm
aware
of
any
case
in
which
it
either
has
done
so
or
has
rejected
doing
so.
it's
clear
that
it
has
applied
both
the
excessive
ball
clause
and
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishments
clause.
in
fact,
the
kinds
of
provisions
that
are
not
incorporated
are
basically
procedural
provisions
like
the
jury
trial
right
of
the
seventh
amendment
or
the
indictment
right
under
the
fifth
amendment.
we
are
talking
here
about
a
substantive
protection
of
individual
rights
under
the
bill
of
rights,
i
think.
the
protection
against
excessive
punishments.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
define
state
action
because
it's
going
to
be...
in
this
case
it's
federal
action
really...
it's
going
to
be
the
united
states
marshall
who
is
going
to
come
to
browning-ferris'
office
if
they
don't
pay
the
judgment
and
cart
away
its
property
to
sell
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
not
at
all.
our
position...
it
would
be
state
action
if
the
suit
were
in
state
court
and
the
sheriff
were
going
to
do
it.
it
seems...
it
seems
to
me
clear,
justice
o'connor,
that
where
the
punishment
is
inflicted
by
virtue
of
the
judgment
of
a
court,
even
in
a
private
civil
action,
that
constitutes
state
action.
i
don't
think
the
state
can
avoid
the
responsibility
to
adhere
to
the
constitution
by
using
the
medium...
it's
still
the
power
of
the
state
that
enforces
the
judgment.
the
medium
is
simply
this
trial
before
a
state
or
federal
court
between
private
parties.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
believe
it
would
not
be
a
substantial
expansion
at
all
and
i
think
there
are
several
reasons
for
that.
first
of
all,
there
is
no
expansion
of
the
number
of
cases
that
would
be
brought.
this
is
simply
an
issue
that
would
arise
in
an
existing
case.
so,
this
would
not
involve
the
lower
federal
courts
in
a
single
case
more
than
they
would
otherwise
be
involved
in.
it
is
simply
where
a
tort
suit
is
brought
and
a
claim
for
punitive
damages
is
made
there
is
the
possibility
of
raising
the
claim
that
the
constitutional
award
is...
that
the
punitive
damages
award
is
excessive.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
state
courts--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
the
second...
yes,
many
of
these
are
in
state
courts.
and,
again,
it
would
require
the
state
courts
to
do
something
similar
to
what
they
do
anyway,
which
is
a
normal
judicial
function,
which
is
to
review
the
excessiveness
of
verdicts.
now,
we
believe
that
the
way
many
state
courts
have
done
this
is
a
constitutionally
unacceptable
method
for
approaching
it.
that
is,
it's
been
purely
subjective
in
the
standard--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
let
me
say
this
about
that...
about
that
concern.
i
think
there
are
several
things
to
be
said.
the
first
is
that
if
the
court
decides
this
case
and
it
holds
that
the
eighth
amendment
applies,
and
it
sets
forth
a
framework
within
which
the
eighth
amendment
analysis
is
to
be
conducted,
i
think
you
will
find
that
even
though
in
theory
it
is
possible
to
raise
claims,
that
the
incidence
of
the
exorbitant
awards
will
be
substantially
reduced.
the
second
thing
is
that
the
same
thing
could
be
said
about
the
rule
that
a
criminal
conviction
must
rest
on
evidence
that
satisfies
the
reasonable
doubts
standard.
that
is
an
issue...
well,
the
same
thing
could
be
said
about
applying
the
speedy
trial
clause
to
the
states.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
that
is
in
fact
one
of
the
concerns.
in
a
case
like
jackson
against
virginia
the
concern
was
that
you
were
creating
an
additional
cause
of
action
a
whole
new
case,
that
could
be
brought
to
review
the
question
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
a
claim
which
will
arise
in
a
relatively
small
proportion
of
the
cases,
and,
indeed,
a
much
smaller
proportion
of
the
cases
after
this
court
establishes
the
analytical
framework
within
which
these
cases
are
to
arise
or
these
claims
are
to
be
evaluated.
and
i
think
it
will
be
easy
for
this
court
unless...
this
court
would
not
grant
certiorari
in
particular
cases
unless
it
saw
a
question
of
general
importance
about
the
administration
of
the
punitive
damages
system.
if
it
sees
a
question
of
general
importance,
if
it
sees
a
recurring
type
of
problem
in
which
excessive
punitive
damages
may
be
being
inflicted,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
the
duty
that
the
constitution
places
upon
this
court
is
to
explicate
the
law
in
this
area
where
it
would
be
useful.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
don't
believe
it
does
and
i
don't
believe
it's
the
burden
of
our
submission
that
it
does.
you
have
to
distinguish
between
the
class
of
cases...
which
i
hope
would
increasingly
come
to
be
the
norm
and
which
is
the
norm
in
the
case
of
criminal
case
finds...
where
the
legislature
has
established
standards.
and
in
that
class
of
cases
our
position
is
that
the
constitutional
inquiry
would
defer
substantially
to
the
legislative
judgment.
what
the
constitution
does--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
by
and
large
i
think
that
is
our
position
because
our
position
is
only
that
the
excessive
fine
inquiry
under
the
federal
constitution
is
an
outer
perimeter.
within
that
outer
perimeter,
the
states
are
free
to
set
the
rules
as
they
see
fit.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
understand.
--if
the
state
wants
to
say
for
a
particular
type
of
offense
you
can
be
fined
one-quarter
of
your
net
worth,
that's
fine
if
the
state
hates
a
particular
thing
that
much.
so
long
as
the
state
treats
everybody
alike.
but
i
gather
what
you're
mainly
complaining
about
is
the
flukiness
of
judgments.
now,
that
would
be
eliminated
within
each
state,
at
least,
wouldn't
it,
if
you
applied
the
excessive
fines
clause
simply
to
require
the
state
to
have
some
consistency
in
judgments
within
its
own
state.
well,
let
me
say,
justice
scalia,
that
i
think
your
position
comes
to
a
hard
place
against
solem
against
helm
when
you
come
up
against
that.
and
i
think
what
solem
teaches
us
is
that
where
the
legislature
sets
a
boundary,
that
will
be
respected.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
let's
say
that
it's
the
last
case
i'm
aware
of
in
which
this
court
has
addressed
the
matter.
but
let
me
back
up
for
a
minute.
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
vermont
or
federal
law
has
authorized
in
any
affirmative
way
a
$6
million
verdict.
this
is
a
case
in
which
we
have
a
system
of
the
sky
is
the
limit,
we
won't
tell
you
what
it
is.
whatever
amount
the
jury
comes
up
with,
if
it
doesn't
shock
our
conscience...
and
we
won't
tell
you
how
we
decide
that...
is
okay.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
would
be
a
different...
it
would
be
a
different
case
and
i
would
have
a
much
harder
task.
but
i'm
not
prepared
to
concede
that
if
by
some
fluke
vermont
decided
that
for
double-parking
the
appropriate
penalty
was
a
million
dollars,
that
this
court
would
have
nothing
to
say
about
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
because
i
think
the
eighth
amendment
is
a
provision
that
commits
to
the
courts
some
safety
net
function
in
this
area.
i
mean,
i
hate...
i
hate...
don't
want
to,
if
i
can
avoid
it,
prolong
this
dispute
because
i
don't
think
it's
this
case.
that
is,
i
don't
see,
even
if
you
were
correct...
unless
you
want
to
take
the
next
step
and
say
that
a
state
that
has
no
system,
that
sets
no
standards,
that
the
maximum
penalty
is
any
amount
you
can
dream
of
for
any
wrong
that
you
do,
which
i
think
is
totally
inconsistent
with
the
eight
amendment.
and
i
might
say
that
this
court
in
a
federal
case
should
not
allow
that
kind
of
award
to
be
entered.
i
don't
believe
vermont
law
permits
that.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i'm
not
willing
to--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
am...
i
am...
i
think
the
answer
is
no,
although
in
this
case
i
would
be
satisfied,
i
think,
with
that
reading.
i
think
we
would
still
win.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
insist
on...
i
don't
insist
on
anything.
i
urge
the
court--
[laughter]
--that
it...
that
it
consider
a
rule
under
which
the
punishment
bears
some
relationship
to
the
crime.
that
is,
i
think
the
macado
is
somewhere
in
the
eighth
amendment.
but
i
have
to
stress--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--because
i
think
our
position
is
that
the
standard--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--is
not
the
same
where
there
are
different
legislative
judgments.
that
is--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--if
there
are
no
legislative
judgments--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i'm
still
not
sure,
justice
stevens,
that
i
can
go
that
far
because
the
approach
that
we
suggest
which
is
the...
in
which
we
are
guided
by
solem...
and
maybe
i
shouldn't
be,
but
it
is
the
most
recent
word,
if
not
the
last
word,
of
the
court
on
the
subject...
is
a
multi-factor
approach.
one
of
the
relevant
factors
is
what
happens
in
vermont,
is
this
in
line
with
the
penalties
that
are
inflicted
in
vermont
for
this
kind
of
misconduct?
that
is
a
relevant
factor.
so,
i
am
not--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--no.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
don't...
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
one
of
the
problems
i
have
with
looking
at
other
punitive
damages
awards,
as
opposed
to
legislative
judgments
or
even
court-made
common
law
explications
of
rules
is
that
they
are
all
the
product
of
the
same,
what
we
feel,
defective
system
that
is
bound,
not
regularly,
but
all
too
frequently
to
produce
these
bloated,
irrational,
excessive
awards.
so,
i
don't
even
like
looking
at
other
punitive
damages
awards.
but
i
guess
i'm
somewhere...
i
can
imagine
a
system
or
a
set
of
rules...
and
i
don't
think
this
is
the
court's
problem
today
because
it
seems
to
me
that
whoever
is
right
in
this
debate,
this
award
is
excessive.
if
the
eighth
amendment
applies
to
the
states,
the
eighth
amendment
authorizes
the
striking
down
of
this
award.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
you
mean
where
this--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
think
it
would
be--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
think
it
would
be
a
much...
a
much
harder
argument
to
make.
just
as
in
solem
it
was
a
hard
argument
to
make
that
the
legislative
determination...
it
was
a
five
to
four
case...
it's
a
much
harder
argument
to
make.
now,
i
will
say
about
the
one
million
dollars
that
is...
authorizes
a
criminal
fine
for
antitrust
violations,
that
that
provides
very
little
benchmark
to
justify
the
$6
million
here.
because
$1
million
represents
the
congressional
judgment
about
the
penalty
that
should
be
imposed
for
the
most
severe
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws.
now,
whatever
you
may
think
about
the
conduct
here,
and
i'm
sure
mr.--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--will
tell
you--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
a
corporation
can't.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
penalty
for
a
corporation...
in
fact,
i
think
there
may
be
a
distinction
in--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--this
$6
million
for
this
conduct,
i
think
would
be
excessive
anywhere,
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we...
that
is
our
position.
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think...
i
think
you
would
have
to
find
that
it
was
punishment
to
agree
with
us
under
the
eighth
amendment
argument.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
our
view
is
that
what
the
word
"fine"
means
is
a
monetary
exaction
for
purposes
of
punishment.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
need
not
be
punishment
that
is
inflicted
as
a
result
of
a
criminal
prosecution.
definitely
we
are
contending
that.
in
fact...
in
fact,
we
think
that--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i
think
it's
a
question
of
how
we
use
the
word
punishment.
only
if
you
define
the
word
punishment
as
being
that
which
is
inflicted
after
a
criminal
proceeding.
and
i
understand
that
in
ingraham
that
the
court
was
talking
about
a
different
provision
of
the
eighth
amendment.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishments
clause.
it
said
we're
going...
what
we
are
going
to
do
is
to
say
that
you
can't
punish
people
except
through
the
criminal
process.
now,
i'm
not
talking
about
fines
but
other
kinds
of
punishments.
they
are
corporal
punishment.
therefore,
it
said
if
something
is
punishment
within
the
meaning
of
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishments
clause,
you
have
to
have
a
criminal
prosecution.
now,
we
have
a
different
history
in
the
case
of
civil
penalties,
civil
punishments.
we
have
a
history
that
goes
back
to,
really,
the
time
of
amercements
of
magna
carta
of
punishing
people
for
wrongdoing
in
civil
proceedings.
and
where
the
punishment
is
monetary
only
and,
therefore,
within
the
contemplation
of
the
excessive
fines
clause,
i
think
my
provision
is...
my
argument
is
that
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it's
inflicted
on
a
civil
or
criminal--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--they
are
almost
always
talked
about
as
a--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--form
of
punishment
for--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--purposes
o?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--huh?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
don't
think...
i
don't
think
it's
a
problem
for
my
case,
to
make
that--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--we
have
a--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--we
have
a
footnote
in
our
reply
brief
which
addresses
that
question,
and
my
understanding
is
that
the
tradition
is
not
to
refer
to
the
magna
carta
or
the
english
bill
of
rights
even...
even
in
setting
aside
criminal
fines
as
excessive.
it's
just
simply
the
way
the
english
do
it.
but
i
think
it
is
understood
that
it
is
part
of
the
tradition.
that
is,
the
rights
that
were
protected
by
magna
carta.
this
court
has
always
thought
it
part
of
what
was
brought
through
the
english
bill
of
rights
into
the
eighth
amendment.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
you
mean
what
is
the
standard
for--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--excessiveness?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
actually--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--actually,
magna
carta
contained
a
standard
which,
to
my
mind,
is
far
more
satisfactory
than
the
"shock
the
conscience"
standard.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
do
set
them
aside.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
do
set
them
aside.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
can't
tell
you
that
i
am
as
familiar
with
the
details
of
the
english...
of
the
english
cases,
so
i'm
not
sure
that
i
could
tell
you--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
what
it
means
is
that
the...
i
mean,
i'm
not
sure
what
does
it
mean
to
say
that
a
punishment
is
excessive.
in
my
mind
what
it
must
mean
is
that
the
punishment
is...
you
first
look
at
what
is
the
purpose
of
punishing
somebody.
the
purpose
is
to
exact
just
retribution
for
wrongful
conduct,
first
of
all,
and
secondly,
to
deter
the
offender
and
others
like
the
offender
from
committing
similar
offenses
in
the
future.
now,
if
you
ask
yourself
whether
a
punishment
is
excessive,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
ask
yourself
whether
considering
what
the
offender
did,
considering
what
the
purposes
of
the
punishment
are,
is
this
more
than
is
necessary.
and
we
have
in
american
law
in
the
area
of
bail,
precisely
that
kind
of
analysis.
that
is,
we
ask
what
is
the
purpose
for
releasing
somebody
on
bail
and
requiring
bail
when
we
release
somebody
before
a
trial.
the
purpose
is
to
insure
their
attendance
at
trial.
what
amount
of
bail
is
excessive?
the
amount
of
bail
that
is
more
than
reasonably
necessary
to
accomplish
that
purpose.
now,
i
don't
see
how
the
protection
that...
that
you
are
given
under
the
eighth
amendment
or
under
the
due
process
clause,
or
that
this
court
should
impose
as
a
discipline
on
the
federal
courts
in
reviewing
damages
awards
can
soundly
look
to
a
different
standard.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
that--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
think
it
does,
but
i
know
that
my
brother
here
thinks
that
it
incorporates
only
the
"shock
the
conscience"
standard
which
is
a
purely
subjective
unreviewable
standard.
in
my
view,
he
has
to
explain
whether
it's
under
the
due
process
clause
or
under
the
excessive
fines
clause
how
an
award
of
this
size
can
possibly
be
justified
by
the
purposes
for
which...
for
which
bfi
is
being
punished.
and
i
think
that
the
cases
that
he
relies
on
make
it
clear
that
the
due
process
clause
regulates
excessive
punishments
every
bit
as
much
as
the
excessive
fines
clause
does.
the
pre-incorporation
cases--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
it
is
almost
entirely
substantive.
and
to
the
extent
it's
procedural,
it
only
asks
the
court
to
consider
as
relevant
in
determining
the
excessiveness,
the
process
by
which
this
came
up.
that
is,
we
did
not
object
to
the
procedures
as
such.
we
are,
therefore,
not
making
a
procedural
due
process
claim.
but,
just
as
the
eighth
amendment
brings
procedural
considerations
into
the
determination
of
whether
a
punishment
is
cruel
and
unusual
and
requires
procedures
as
well
as
substance,
we
think
the
procedures
that
produce
this
award
are
irrelevant.
thank
you.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
please,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
in
looking
to
history
let
me
just
say
that
mr.
farr
neglects
to
mention
or
explain
why
every
single
commentator
who
has
written
on
this
subject
disagrees
with
him.
this
notion
of
the
role
of
juries
that
he
espouses
is
in
fact
inconsistent
with
the
history
because
after
magna
carta
the
writ
of
misericordia
was
available
to
reduce
excessive
jury
amercements.
i
don't
want
to
get
bogged
down
in
the
history
which
has
been
thoroughly
briefed
on
both
sides.
let
me
say
with
respect
to
the
rummel
point
that
was
discussed
that
what
mr.
farr
persists
in
ignoring
is
the
element
of
legislative
deference.
rummel
was
a
mandatory
life
sentence
established
by
texas,
and
in
that
context
the
court
said
it
wasn't
going
to
find
that
the
eighth
amendment
refused
to
permit
that.
the
principle,
though,
and
the
principle
of
the
dissenters
in
solem
against
helm
was
you
have
to
defer
where
the
legislature
has
made
a
judgment.
that
was
the
dispute
in
solem.
there
is
no
legislative
judgment
in
this
case
that
underlies
this
award.
now,
i
don't
want
the
court
to
forget
our
common
law
non-constitutional
review
of
excessiveness
argument
because
it's
of
course
much
more
interesting
to
debate
the
eighth
amendment,
but
even
if
you
decide
the
eighth
amendment
is
inapplicable,
you
have
to
ask
yourselves
whether
you
have
a
responsibility
in
a
federal
case
to
establish
a
reasonable
federal
rule.
