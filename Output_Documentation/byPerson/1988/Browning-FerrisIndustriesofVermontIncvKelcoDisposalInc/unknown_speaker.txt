unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
frey,
what
kind
of
federal
law
do
you
think
applies
here?
do
we
look
to
vermont
state
law
in
this
instance?
how
do
we
get
the
federal
law
issue
before
us?
unknown
speaker
is
it
through
your
excessive
fines
clause
of
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
the
one
you're
arguing
today?
is
that
the
one--
unknown
speaker
--that
was
raised
below?
unknown
speaker
but
was
that
raised
below?
unknown
speaker
has
this
court
ever
incorporated
the
excessive
fines
clause
into
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
make
it
applicable
to
the
states?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
define
state
action
here?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
would
limit
this
to
just
suits
in
federal
court?
unknown
speaker
but,
if
you
are
right,
it
would
involve
the
federal
courts
and
this
court
in
reviewing
every
state
tort
judgment
that
resulted
in
punitive
damages.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
it
would
be
a
substantial
expansion,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
state
courts,
though?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
a
lot
of
these
are
in
state
courts.
unknown
speaker
but
then
petitions
for
certiorari
would
be
filed
and
if
there
is
a
federal
doctrine
we've
enunciated,
that's
one
more
thing
we
would
have
to
look
at.
unknown
speaker
in
a
criminal
case
you
have
habeas
corpus.
a
criminal
judgment
does
not
become
final
where
a
civil
judgment
does.
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
assuming
that
the
excessive
fines
clause
applies
to
the
states,
i
find...
why
must
it
apply
so
as
to
impose
a
national
standard?
i
find
it
difficult
to
think
that
the
constitution
meant
to
say
every
state
has
to
hate
predatory
pricing
the
same
amount.
unknown
speaker
why
not
totally?
is
the
standard
you
ask
us
to
impose
a
national
standard
or
rather
should
we
just
look
to
each
individual
state
and
say
this
award
is
excessive
given
what's
done
within
that
state,
and
allow
each
state
to
say
how
much
it
hates
it
each
individual
thing
as
much
as
it
wants?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
we're
not
in
agreement.
i'm
not
talking
about
any
outer
perimeter.
i'm
saying
that--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
regard
solem
as
the
last
word
on
that
subject?
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
a
different
case
if
you
had
had
fifteen
$6
million
verdicts
in
vermont
and
the
vermont
supreme
court
had
looked
at
all
of
these
and
said,
"yeah,
we
hate
predatory
pricing
that
much."
it
would
be
a
different
case,
wouldn't
it?
even
without
a
legislative
pronouncement.
unknown
speaker
why?
why
would
we
care
how
much...
maybe
vermont
has
a
real
problem
with
double-parking.
[laughter]
the
citizens
of
vermont
can...
you
know,
can
handle
that
the
way
they
want,
can't
they?
unknown
speaker
you
were
not...
all
i'm...
i
just
want
to
get
your
answer
to
one
question.
you
do
not...
you're
not
willing
to
read
"excessive"
to
mean
simply
excessive
with
regard
to
other
fines
imposed
by
that
state?
unknown
speaker
you
insist
upon
some
national
standard?
yes
or
no?
i
think
that
can
be
answered
yes
or
no.
unknown
speaker
no...
yes,
you
insist
on
a
national
standard?
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
i
don't
understand
why
you're
not
willing
to
say
it's
a
national
standard.
that's
the
way
i
read
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but
if
there
are
no
legislative
judgments.
unknown
speaker
basically
we
have
a
system
now
with
no
legislative
judgments
so
far.
so,
in
that
ballpark
isn't
the
standard
the
same
everywhere
under
your
submission?
unknown
speaker
well,
assume
we
thought
that
a
$100
million
fine
was
clearly
excessive,
do
you
think
it
would
stop
being
excessive
because
vermont
had
inflicted
it
a
hundred
times?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
follow
that
approach.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
this
award
would
be
excessive
if
vermont
had
a
statute
that
said
there
should
be
no
punitive
damage
awards
in
excess
of
$10
million
in
cases...
and
somehow
describe
this
kind
of
economic
tort?
unknown
speaker
what
if
there
was
a
federal...
what
if
the
federal
antitrust
penalties
were
raised
to
$10
of
criminal
penalties
and
you
have
this
very
violation?
would
a
$6
million
fine
violate
the
excessive
fines
clause?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
have
a
sherman
act
found
violation
here.
unknown
speaker
i
would
assume--
unknown
speaker
--a
judge,
if--
unknown
speaker
--well,
that's
not
quite
right--
unknown
speaker
--because
you
can
also
go
to
jail.
unknown
speaker
oh,
okay.
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
you
take
the
position...
excessive
in
any
state?
unknown
speaker
in
any
state?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
frey,
you're
talking
interchangeably
about
an
excessive
fine
and
punishment.
do
you
think
we
have
to
find
that
this
fine
was
punishment
in
order
to
agree
with
you?
unknown
speaker
uh-huh.
because
you
think...
because?
unknown
speaker
but
you
must
be
contending
that
it
needn't
be
criminal
punishment?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
do
you
have
to
even
talk
about
punishment
then?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
guess
punitive
damages
are
often
talked
about
as
a
form
of
punishment.
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
so,
it--
unknown
speaker
--it
isn't
much
of
a
problem
you
say?
unknown
speaker
it
isn't
much
of
an
issue?
unknown
speaker
in
the
english
or
the
commonwealth
countries,
have
they
relied
on
the
magna
carta
or
the
english
bill
of
rights
to
set
aside
any
punitive
damage
award--
unknown
speaker
--in
a
civil
case?
unknown
speaker
is
there
some
objective
standard
apparent
there
or
is
it
again
what
seems
to
shock
the
conscience
of
the
trial
court?
unknown
speaker
in
setting
aside--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
in
civil...
in
civil
cases.
unknown
speaker
no.
i
mean
what
the
english
judges
do
when
they
set
aside
punitive
damages
awards,
if
they
do.
unknown
speaker
but,
do
they
have
an--
unknown
speaker
--objective
standard?
unknown
speaker
well,
because
if
we're
saying
that
the
magna
carta
and
the
english
bill
of
rights
incorporates
this
idea,
then
i
should
think
that
the
english
judges
would
incorporate
it
somehow
with
an
objective
standard,
if
that's
what
you
say
it
means.
unknown
speaker
is
the
due
process
clause
equally
of
assistance
to
you
in
this
case
as...
suppose
there
were
no
problem
with
it
having
been
raised,
that
the
due
process
clause
was
clearly
raised
below--
unknown
speaker
--but
does
that
really
incorporate
just
about
the
same
standard
we're
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
is
your
due
process
argument
a
substantive
due
process
argument
entirely
or
is
it
partly
procedural?
unknown
speaker
what
about...
what
about
qwe
time
actions
where
a
private
individual
brings
in
effect
a
criminal
action
and
gets
to
keep
part
of
the
fine
himself?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that's--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
mean,
that's
so
because
you
say
it.
why
can't
we
say
this
private
party,
to
the
extent
he's
getting
punitive
damages,
is
essentially
standing
in
the
shoes
of
the
government?
unknown
speaker
well,
to
give
it
to
the
person
who
brings
a
qwe
time
action?
unknown
speaker
do
you
acknowledge
that
what
goes
to
the
private
individual
in
one
of
those
actions
is
a
fine?
unknown
speaker
so
you
can
have
fines
of
unlimited
scope
so
long
as
you
don't
make
them
payable
to
the
government.
just
have
an
individual
bring
the
suit
and
keep
the
money?
unknown
speaker
how
about
a
state
like
florida
that
makes
a
percentage
of
punitive
damages
awards
go
to
the
state?
unknown
speaker
it
probably
is
if
the
state
is
facing
a
budget
deficit.
unknown
speaker
well,
don't
punitive
damages
serve
a
penal
function?
unknown
speaker
they
really
do.
they
are
designed
to
deter
and
to
punish.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
serve--
unknown
speaker
--to
make
the
plaintiff
whole.
unknown
speaker
compensatory
damages
have
all
the
appearance
of
being
penal
in
nature,
and
one
does
have
some
concern
when
the
amount
awarded
is
more
than
600
times
the
highest
possible
criminal
time--
unknown
speaker
--for
the
same
conduct.
it's
a
concern.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
there
is
a
parallel
because
in
those
cases
the
attorney
who
is
standing
before
the
jury
arguing
for
the
court
is
representing
the
crown
that
gets
the
money.
unknown
speaker
and
the
parallel
is
precise
here
because
the
attorney
standing
before
the
jury
arguing
for
the
punitive
damages,
his
client
gets
the
money.
so
the
parallel
is
precise,
it
seems
to
me.
unknown
speaker
by
why
is
the
incentive
by
either
the
parties
or
the
jury
any
greater
to
give
punitive
damages
where
the
government
gets
the
money
than
where
the
private
plaintiff
does,
other
than
the
fact
that
the
jurors
are
taxpayers?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure
that's
always
true,
mr.
farr.
each
state
certainly
has
some
incentive
to
want
to
see
its
courts
used
to
a
certain
extent,
and
i
think
particularly
you
attract
plaintiffs
to
a
state
where
there
are
liberal
punitive
damage
rules.
unknown
speaker
mr.
farr--
unknown
speaker
--these
are
the
same
jurors--
unknown
speaker
--in
federal
and
the
state
court,
they
are
the
same
people.
unknown
speaker
talking
about
the
state's
interests.
unknown
speaker
is
your
position--
unknown
speaker
--there
is
no
such
thing
as
an
excessive--
unknown
speaker
--no
such
thing
as
an
excessive
verdict
or
judgment?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
of
one?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
of
one
that's
been
upset?
unknown
speaker
well,
was
remittitur
used
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
who
decided--
unknown
speaker
--who
decided
that?
unknown
speaker
the
trial
judge?
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
it
got
up
to
the
second
circuit?
unknown
speaker
you
are
saying
that
there's
no
such
thing
as
an
excessive
award
of
punitive
damages
as
far
as
the
federal
constitution
is
concerned?
unknown
speaker
aren't
you
saying
that?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
could
i
talk
about
due
process
for
a
minute,
which
you
haven't
alluded
to.
unknown
speaker
suppose
a
state
runs
a
system
in
which
it
does
not
have
any
judge
review
of
damages
award?
not
punitive
damages,
but
compensatory.
he
lets
the
jury,
you
know,
pick
a
number.
and
the
judge
doesn't
review
it
at
all.
would
that
violate
the
due
process
clause?
unknown
speaker
it
is
a...
well,
it
is
a
procedural
due
process
issue,
but
you
can
tell
whether
the
procedure
is
working,
i
suppose,
by
whether
you
have
rough
uniformity
of
treatment.
i'm
not
sure
that
the
result
is
any
different
from
excessive
fines.
it
wouldn't
produce
a
$6
million
verdict
versus
a
$100,000
verdict
in
the
same
kind
of
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly,
all
procedures
are
directed
to
securing
an
objective
and
a
fair
result,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
one
can
ask
whether
rummel
was
the
last
word
on
the
eighth
amendment.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
of
course,
rummel
wouldn't...
wouldn't
stand
in
the
way
of
an
interpretation
of
the
excessive
fines
clause
that
simply
applies
it
on
a
state
by
state
basis.
in
rummel
there
was
no
indication
that
that
particular
sentence
was
excessive
as
far
as
what
that
same
state
would
do
in
another
case.
it
might
have
been
considered
by
some
excessive
on
the
basis
of
a
national
standard.
but
on
the
basis
of
a
state
standard
there
were
clear
limits
established
within
the
state
by
the
legislature.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
it
you're
not
claiming
that
this
excessive
fines
clause
applies
only
in
criminal
cases?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
are...
the
federal
government
imposes
what's
called
fines
in
civil
cases,
doesn't
it?
do
you
think
this
provision
is
applicable
to
those
situations?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
know?
well,
i
would
suppose
you
would
have
to
know
to
make
this
argument.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--well,
here
is
a
fine
that
is
called
a
fine
and
it's
in
a
civil
case
and
it's
paid
to
the
government.
now,
is
this
provision
amercements?
i
thought
you
would...
i
thought
one
of
your
points
was
that...
that
if
it's
paid
to
the
government,
then
the
clause
is
applicable.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--well,
what
about--
unknown
speaker
--what
about--
unknown
speaker
--but
you
don't
think
it's...
you
don't
think
that
when
you
use
the
word
"fine"...
just
fine...
it
can
be
a
fine
imposed
in
a
civil
case
by
the
government?
unknown
speaker
well,
so,
you
aren't
prepared
to
concede,
though,
that
the
clause
applies
to
those
fines
by
the
government
in
civil
cases?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
your
answer
is...
your
answer
is
that
obviously,
no,
it
doesn't
apply.
look
to
history
and
it
doesn't
apply.
if
you
looked
at
history,
it
does
not
apply,
justice
white.
that
is
correct.
but
that
is
in
fact
the
analysis
that
the
court
has
had
in
other
provisions
which
are
clearly
intended
to
apply
and,
in
fact,
specifically
limited
by
their
terms,
to
criminal
cases.
the
court
has
not
automatically
said
we
apply
them.
even
in
civil
cases
in
which
the
government
is
the
moving
force,
the
court
has
sometimes
applied
an
analysis
to
say
is
this
fine
essentially
something
that
we
can
call...
even
though
it's
a
denominated
civil...
criminal
in
nature?
and
if
that's
the
kind
of
situation,
like
in
united
states
v.
ward,
the
court
has
not
said
this
applies
outside
the
criminal
context.
it
says
this
is
basically
something
that
is
criminal
in
nature
and
has
moved
it
into
the
context
that
way.
that
is
possible.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
that
could
not
be
appropriate
in
a
case
in
which
those
standards
were
met.
but
that
is
very
different
from
a
situation
which
is
simply
a
dispute
between
private
parties.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
from
a
federal
court?
