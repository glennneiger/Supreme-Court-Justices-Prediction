there
a
finding

to
support
you
in
this?

or
was

on,
the
labor
market
question.
number
90
of
the
supreme
court's
findings,
concludes
with
the
sentence,
"it
is
not
a
reasonable
business
practice
to
scour
such
sparsely
populated,
remote
regions
for
skilled
and
experienced
workers.
"
are
you
saying
that
is
clearly
erroneous?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
you
don't
get
to
business
necessity
until
you
get
to
the
relevant
market
and
isn't
this
the
trial
court's
finding
of
fact
that
bears
on
the
relevant
market?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
he
did
not
make
that
finding
for
that
purpose?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
whole
finding,
that
whole
series
of
findings,
plus

directed
at
describing
the
general
labor
force,
by
which
he
means
the
general
labor
market.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
there
is
ample
evidence
to
support
that
finding,
is
there
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
you
challenge
that
finding
in
the
ninth
circuit?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
it
must
be
a
market...
relevant
market
finding.
