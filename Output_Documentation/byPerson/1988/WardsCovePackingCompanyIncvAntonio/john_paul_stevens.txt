justice
john
paul
stevens
but
would
you
correct
me
on
thing?
this
is
a
hard
case
to
keep
all
the
facts
in
mind,
and
i
read
the
briefs
a
little
while
ago,
so
that
i
am
a
little
rusty.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
recall
that
the
error
the
district
court
made,
the
basic
error
of
law,
was
that
it
thought
that
disparate
impact
analysis
did
not
apply
to
subjective
employment
decisions,
subjective
employment
hiring
practices?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
was
wrong
in
that
regard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
are
you
saying...
and
therefore,
the
court
of
appeals
said
go
back
and
take
another
look
at
it.
and
you
are
saying
that
even
without
that
basic
error,
the
findings
are
adequate
to
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
there
is
no
prima
facie
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
that
finding
was
not
an
essential
part
of
the
district
court's
analysis,
it
was
just
kind
of
thrown
in
as
an
alternative
ground
of
decision?
i
am
little
puzzled
by
how
that
could
work.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
you
argue
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
there
is
no
need
to
review
the
legal
question
of
whether
the...
you
know,
the
subjective
aspect
of
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
did?
i
see.
but
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
with
you
on
that
then?
they
thought
that
you
ought
to
have,
you
know,
needed
a
further
hearing
in
view
of
the
rather
different
change
in
the
view
of
the
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
judge...
as
i
remember
judge
sneed
wrote
a
separate
opinion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
he
said
as
to
some
issues,
he
thought
you
were
dead
right
and
other
issues
you
weren't
but
you
say
he
was
even
wrong
on
those
where
he
thought
there
was
a
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
see,
the
thing
that
troubles
me
frankly,
is
that
you
are
asking
us
to
make
an
even
more
detailed,
factual
view
of
the
district
court's
findings
and
the
evidence,
than
any
judge
on
the
court
of
appeals
was
willing
to
make,
even
though
they
heard
the
case
en
banc.
no
judge
on
the
court
of
appeals
bought
your
theory,
and
there
were
a
lot
of
them
heard
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
may
be
dead
right.
i
mean
there
is
just
kind
of
a
little
inertia
that
kind
of
troubles
me
in
a
case
with
this
big
a
record,
and
this
many
issues.
