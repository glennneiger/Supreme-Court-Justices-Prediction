mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
patterns
of
segregation
by
race,
in
jobs,
housing
and
messing
at
three
alaska
salmon
canneries,
two
of
which
are
in
remote
locations.
the
work
is
of
a
migrant,
seasonal
nature,
and
that
means,
as
a
practical
matter,
that
the
employer
provides
housing
and
messing
facilities.
the
segregation,
as
a
result
of
that
fact,
completely
pervades
the
lives
of
employees
at
the
cannery.
what
you
have
is,
in
effect,
a
company
town,
where
virtually
every
aspect
of
the
employee's
life
is
dominated,
and
controlled
and
set
by
the
employer.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
the
total
number
of
employees?
there
are
probably
200
at
the
cannery
in
a
given
year.
it
varies
depending
on
the
fish
run
and
it
also
depends
on
the
canneries.
one
cannery,
in
ketchikan,
hires
a
lot
of
employees
on
an
as-needed
basis
for
a
day
or
two
at
a
time.
the
others
don't
have
that
option.
the
largest
department
at
the
cannery
is
the
cannery
worker
department
and
that
is
37
percent
non-white
to
70
percent
non-white,
depending
on
which
cannery
we
are
talking
about.
despite
this
very
heavy
concentration
of
non-whites
in
this,
the
lowest-paying
department,
there
are
five-to-seven...
again,
depending
on
which
cannery
we
are
talking
about...
departments
that
are
at
least
90
percent
white
and
many
of
those
jobs
and
many
of
those
departments
have
been
100
percent
white
for
the
entire
case
period
concerning...
that
this
litigation
concerns.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
they
all
hired
for
seasonal
work.
i
think
that
mr.
fryer
was
saying,
and
incorrectly
i
might
add,
that
the
concentration
of
non-whites
in
the
cannery
worker
jobs
is
due
to
dispatch
practices
of
local
37.
there
are,
for
union
purposes,
two
types
of
cannery
workers...
non-resident
cannery
workers
who
reside
in
the
lower
48;
and
resident
cannery
workers
who
reside
in
alaska
during
the
rest
of
the
year.
first
of
all,
local
37
represents
only
the
non-cannery...
non-resident
cannery
workers.
even
the
hiring
for
the
resident
cannery
workers,
where
there
is
no
local
37
involvement,
is
very
heavily
non-white.
in
fact,
of
the
five
canneries
that
this
case
initially
covered,
the
most
heavily
non-white
cannery
was
ekuk,
which
hires
only
resident
cannery
workers.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
how
are
they
broken
up?
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
the
primary
minority
group
at
ekuk
is
alaskan
native.
and
the
cannery
workers
are
almost
all
alaskan
native.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
right.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
that
is
correct.
we
are
saying--
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
--why
is
that
good?
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
the
difference,
your
honor,
is
that
this
employer
hires,
in
cannery
worker
jobs,
virtually
all
non-whites
and
has
other
departments
that
pay
more,
substantially
more,
sometimes
three
or
four
times
more
than
cannery
worker
jobs,
that
are
almost
all
white.
the
problem
is
that--
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
--there
are,
absolutely.
the
recruitment
of
alaska
cannery
workers,
the
alaska
natives,
comes
primarily
in
coastal
villages.
and
the
cannery
workers...
i
am
sorry,
the
residents
of
those
coastal
villages
grow
up
around
the
water.
they
have
an
enormous
amount
of
fishing
and
boating
experience
that
would
imminently
qualify
them
for
even
the
most
difficult
fishing
jobs
at
the
cannery
and
tender
jobs.
and
the
tender
is
the
vessel
that
brings
the
fish
in
from
the
fishing
boat
to
the
cannery
docks.
so
there
is
really
no
question
about
the
availability
of
skilled
personnel.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
no.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
first
of
all,
if
i
can,
i
would
like
to
try
to
explain
how
i
am
going
to
use
these
terms.
labor
market
is
the
area
from
which
people
are
hired.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
okay.
the
labor
force
is
a
combination
of
those
hired
and
those
available
to
be
hired,
and
the
work
force
is
those
hired.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
right,
and
we
contend
that
that
finding
was
induced
by
three
errors
of
law,
and,
as
a
result,
is
clearly
erroneous.
we
also
contend
that
one
need
not
make
a
labor
force
or
a
labor
market
finding
because
the
wording
of
this
statute
here,
prohibits
job
segregation
on
its
face.
and
section
703(a)(2)
just
simply
says
that
it
will
be
an
unlawful
employment
practice
for
an
employer
to
classify,
limit,
or
segregate
employees
in
a
way
that
denies
them
opportunities
on
the
basis
of
race.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
yes,
we
are.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
right.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
right.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
not
in
all
instances.
first
of
all,
we
are
dealing
with--
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
--no.
i
think
that
the
court
can
look
just
to
the
internal
statistics
in
a
case
like
this.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
yes.
the
court
can
do
that
in
this
case.
i
would
like
to
emphasize--
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
--perhaps
i
misspoke,
when
i
said
that
it
can
confine
its
examination,
i
meant
to
the
work
force...
namely
those
hired,
rather
than
those
around
the
cannery.
and
it
is
permissible
to
do
that
simply
because
that
is
what
the
wording
of
the
statute.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
yes,
i
would
like
to
explain
what
i
understand
that
phrase
to
mean.
the
phrase,
because
of
such
individual's
race,
sex
or
national
origin
appears
both
in
section
703(a)(1)
and
section
703(a)(2).
all
that
phrase
does
is
introduce
the
prohibited
bases
for
discrimination.
in
other
words,
title
vii
prohibits
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race,
but
not
age,
and
not
handicap.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
if
it
meant
something
more,
then
we
would
have
a
situation
where
the
phrase,
because
of
which
might
suggest
intentional
discrimination,
means
something,
in
fact,
different
in
those
two
sections.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
perhaps
i
could
emphasize
the
fact
that
this
is
a
very
unique
industry.
we
are
fortunate
in
this
case
to
have
statistics
that
go
all
the
way
back
to
1906
on
the
racial
composition
of
people
in
the
industry.
from
1906,
all
the
way
through
1978,
the
composition
of
those
employed
in
the
industry
was
far
more
heavily
non-white
than
the
racial
composition
of
individuals
in
the
labor
market.
when
we
start
with
a
labor
market
analysis
and
look
at
the
racial
composition
of
people
in
areas
from
which
the
employer
hires,
we
do
so,
at
least
as
teamsters
explains
to
us,
because
over
time
we
expect
the
work
force,
absent
discrimination
to
reflect
the
racial
composition
of
the
labor
market.
we
don't
have
a
situation
like
this
here
because
we
know
that
historically
that
has
never
been
true.
and,
in
fact,
it
is
true
in
a
number
of
migrant,
seasonal
industries
that
those
employed
in
the
industry
are
far
more
heavily
non-white
than
those
in
the
areas
from
which
people
or
workers
are
drawn.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
i
think
that
it
has
very
little
to
do
with
that.
then,
as
now,
people
were
transported
from
the
lower
48.
if
transportation
were
an
issue,
then
you
would
have
expected
some
change
in
the
hiring
patterns
and
there
really
hasn't
been
a
change
in
the
hiring
patterns,
at
least
as
far
as
the
number
or
percent
of
non-whites
in
the
industry
as
a
whole.
so,
it
is
an
unusual
situation.
it
is
not
a
situation
that
crops
up
in
the
kind
of
cases
that
the
courts
are
accustomed
to
dealing
with...
namely
those
that
involve
full-year
employment
at
a
fixed
location.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
well,
no
doubt
that
they
found
that
they
did.
a
high
percentage
of
non-whites
in
the
industry
has
persisted
from
the
time
before
unions
were
formed,
through
today,
when
we
now
have
unions.
the
fact
is
that
those
minorities
are
in
the
industry
and
it
is
simply
not
fair,
nor
does
it
comport
with
title
vii,
to
say
that
they
can,
on
this
long-term
basis,
be
confined
to
the
low-paying,
menial
jobs.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
it
would
be
possible
for
the
court
to
vacate
the
finding
and
remand
for
additional
findings
in
light
of
the
five
factors
mentioned
in
hazelwood,
which
the
district
court
here,
did
not
consider.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
yes,
it
does.
another
alternative
for
the
court
is
to
ask
the
district
court
to
reexamine
the
expert
testimony
that
we
offered
on
labor
supply
that
is,
we
believe,
better
tailored
to
this
industry.
and
that
look
not
at
the
geographical
areas,
but
at
the
historical
percentage
through
to
the
present
of
non-whites
in
the
industry
as
a
whole,
rather
than--
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
--yes.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
it
ended
in
'55,
and
then
for
the
later
years,
we
offered
statistics
on
a
sample
of
those
employed
in
the
industry
through
1978.
it
comprised
about
50
percent
of
those
in
the
industry,
and
the
statistics
showed
the
same
percentage
of
non-whites.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
sure.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
hiring
and
promotion.
it
is
hard
to
draw
the
line
in
a
seasonal
industry.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
they
were
tried
under
both--
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
--yes.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
yes.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
absolutely
and
fringe
benefit
claims.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
well,
i
would
say
that,
but
i
don't
think
i
can
also
just
simply
say
that
is
not
a
business
necessity
finding.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
there
are
many
of--
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
--i
am
not
sure
what
purpose
he
made
it
for.
i
think
he
made
it
as
a
rebuttal
to
our
prima
facie
of
treatment,
namely
that
that
was
a
non-discriminatory
explanation,
rather
than
a
business
necessity
finding.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
that...
that
may
be.
that
is
not
how
i
understood
it.
that
is
not
how
i
understood
the
reason
that
the
employers
were
offering
that
testimony
at
trial.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
no,
there
is
no
finding
at
all
about
the
skill
level
of
people
in
these
villages,
except
the
fact
that
many
of
them
do
have
ample
boating
and
fishing
experience.
beyond
that,
we
are
not
asking
the
employers
to--
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
--i
am
sure
we
did.
it
is
not
a
business
necessity
finding.
it
does
not
say--
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
--well,
the
reason
that
i
say
it
is
not
a
business
necessity
finding
is
that
the
district
court
never
reached
the
issue
of
separate
hiring
channels
on
disparate
impact
grounds.
and,
as
a
result
of
that,
the
district...
district
court
never
made
findings
on
whether
or
not
there
was
a
business
necessity.
to
get
back
to
that
finding...
first
of
all,
there
are
a
number
of
jobs
that
are
at
issue--
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
--well,
what
i
am
arguing
to
the
court
is
that
it
is
not
a
finding
that
is
couched
in
business
necessity.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
yes.
i
would
say
that
there
is
no,
no
support
for
it.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
well,
your
honor,
what
i
would
like
to
do
is
perhaps
try
to
explain
the
fact
that
there
are
many
at-issue
jobs,
upper-level
jobs
that
even
the
district
court
found
were
unskilled,
and
so,
we
are
not
dealing
in
all
cases
with
scouring
a
remote
area.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
that
were
unskilled?
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
i
would
say
there
are
approximately
30
at-issue
job
titles.
if
you
would
like
the
number
of
individuals
in
those
jobs,
i
can
tell
you.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
no.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
roughly,
yes.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
beyond
that,
we
are
not
asking
that
the
employers
be
required
to
scour
these
areas.
they
are
talking
to
these
people
already
about
hiring
them
for
lower-paying
jobs.
they
can
easily
say,
this
is
the
procedure
for
also
seeking
an
upper-level
job.
there
is
no
reason,
no
practical
reason
why
they
have
to
limit
the
options
of
these
individuals
only
to
the
low-paying,
menial
jobs.
finally,
of
course,
that
finding
really
does
not
explain,
in
any
way,
the
refusal
to
consider,
given
the
separate
hiring
channels,
many
of
the
people
from
the
lower
48,
particularly
the
filipino
class
members,
for
upper-level
jobs.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
i
don't
think
the
district
court
made
a
specific
finding
on
considering
and
hiring
cannery
workers.
on
making
an
application--
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
--mr.
antonio
made
several
applications.
toward
the
end--
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
--only
about
five
or
six
years
after
his
first
application
for
an
upper-level
job.
he
made
several
applications,
several
requests.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
that
is
right
and
the
court
of
appeals
vacated
that
finding
because
the
court
of
appeals
began
with
the
proposition
or
found,
from
the
record,
that
the
way
in
which
whites
and
non-whites
were
hired
was,
itself,
discriminatory.
and
that
while
whites
were
being
recruited
by
word-of-mouth
for
many
of
these
upper
level
jobs,
without
necessity
for
an
application,
given
that,
there
was
no
need
or
justification
to
require
cannery
workers
to
make
applications.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
i
don't
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
that.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
if
i
did,
i
misspoke.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
set
aside
a
legal
error
of
the
district
court
and
said
that
its
findings
on
applications
and
what
constituted
a
proper
application
had
to
be
reconsidered
in
light
of
its
own
legal
rulings.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
no,
and
if
i
said
that
they
did,
then
i
misspoke.
i
would
like,
if
i
can,
to
try
to
explain
the
mechanics,
to
some
degree,
of
how
the
separate
hiring
channels
work.
non-whites
are
recruited
from
largely
non-white
sources,
such
as
alaskan
native
villages,
and
through
foremen
of
asian
descent,
and
at
local
37,
which
is
a
union
with
a
large
filipino
membership.
it
is
undisputed
that
those
who
hire
for
the
low-paying,
menial
jobs,
that
these
primarily
non-white
sources
have
no
authority
to
discuss,
in
any
way,
shape
or
form,
the
possibility
of
employment
in
another
upper-level
job
with
potential
candidates.
we
have
talked
a
little
bit
about
the
fact
that
there
are
alaskan
natives
recruited
from
coastal
villages
who,
at
least
would
appear
to
have
significant
skills,
for
the
tender
and
the
fishing
jobs,
that
they
are
excluded.
at
the
same
time,
we
have
whites,
often
who
are
related
to
people
in
management,
who
are
as
young
as
14
years
old,
15
years
old,
16
years
old
and
so
on,
who
are
employed
in
the
upper-level
jobs,
the
better-paying
jobs.
mr.
fryer
discussed
at
length
the
effect
of
local
37
on
hiring...
the
effect
of
local
37
on
the
labor
market
and
on
hiring
here.
we
would
ask
simply
that
the
court
read
the
provisions
of
the
local
37
agreement,
because
the
local
37
agreement
vests
management
with
full
authority
to
hire.
there
are
three
preferences
and
the
preferences
are
the
only
provisions
in
the
labor
contract
that
address
hiring.
the
third
preference,
which
is
the
last
preference,
goes
to
those
individuals
who
are
acceptable
to
management.
the
other
two
preferences
simply
perpetuate
the
past
management
choices,
by
saying
that
individuals
who
worked
at
the
same
cannery
are
entitled
to
first
preference
on
a
rehired
basis;
individuals
who
worked
for
the
same
company
at
another
cannery
are
entitled
to
second
preference
on
a
rehire
basis.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
sure.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
we
have
to
persuade
the
fact
finder
that
there
is
a
disparate
impact
on
the
basis
of
race,
yes.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
the
reason
i
am
having
trouble
with
that,
your
honor,
is
that
racial
bias
suggests
discriminatory
intent.
and
certainly
there
is
no
requirement
of
discriminatory
intent
in
an
impact
case.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
well,
the
court
would
have
to
overrule
a
long
line
of
very
explicit
holdings
of
this
court
in
order
to
reach
the
result
that
intent
is
required
in
a
disparate
impact
violation.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
i
would
have
to
disagree
with
the
court
on
that.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
as
for
the
size
of
the
business,
first
of
all,
title
vii
exempts
very
small
businesses,
and--
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
--okay.
mr.
abraham
a.
arditi
if
the
practice
has
a
disparate
impact
and
it
cannot
be
justified
by
business
necessity,
then
it
is
a
violation
of
the
law,
yes.
going
further
to
the
issue
of
local
37
involvement
in
the
hiring
process,
again,
i
would
ask
the
court
to
note
the
fact
that
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
does
not
provide
for
a
hiring
hall.
this
is
not
the
situation
that
we
often
see
in
the
construction
industry.
it
is
a
situation
in
which
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
reserves
to
management
full
hiring
discretion
and
authority
and
management,
even
if
it
gets
a
referral,
has
every
right
on
earth
to
simply
reject
that
referral.
i
would
like
to
address
mr.
fryer's
comment
that
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
no
deterrence.
in
fact,
the
district
court
made
contradictory
findings
on
that.
when
the
district
court
discussed
individual
instances
of
discrimination,
made
express
findings
that
particular
individuals
did
not
seek
upper-level
jobs
because
of
the
segregation
in
jobs,
messing
and
housing.
also
on
the
question
of
whether
there
were,
in
fact,
24
percent
non-whites
in
the
at
issue
jobs,
i
don't
believe
that
a
reading
of
even
the
employer
statistics
bears
that
out.
what
the
employer
did
was
include
some
jobs
that
are
not
at-issue,
such
as,
laborer
jobs,
and
i
would
refer
the
court
to
our
appendices
a
and
b,
in
which
we
set
out
both
our
own
statistics
on
a
department-by-department
basis
and
the
employer's
statistics
on
a
department-by-department
basis.
and
they
show
a
high
degree
of
racial
segregation.
because
of
the
wide
geographical
area
from
which
people
are
hired,
and
because
of
what
appears
to
be
a
prevalence
of
favoritism,
particularly
in
the
nepotism
area,
it
is
often
unrealistic
to
expect
a
non-white
from
one
remote
area,
such
as
wapata,
washington,
or
bristol
bay,
alaska,
to
make
contact
with
the
tender
captain,
whose
recommendation
is
the
most
influential,
or
the
machinist
foreman,
who,
as
a
practical
matter,
may
make
the
hiring
decisions.
given
the
far-flung
labor
market
area,
from
which
the
employer
hires,
the
effect
of
the
separate
hiring
channels
is
really
aggravated
to
an
extreme.
by
the
time
that
the
cannery
workers
arrive
at
the
cannery,
the
upper-level
jobs
are
already
filled.
the
employer
articulated
in
its
brief,
and
at
trial,
a
policy
of
discouraging
transfers
from
the
heavily
non-white
cannery
worker
jobs
to
the
upper-level
jobs
during
the
season.
so
cannery
workers
are
locked
in.
and
the
employer
also,
at
a
time
when
the
cannery
workers
have
the
easiest
access
to
the
employer...
namely
while
they
are
at
the
cannery...
might
listen
to
a
request
for
a
better
job,
but
will
not
consider
that
an
application.
seeing
that
i
am
close
to
the
end
of
my
time
here,
there
are
a
number
of
practices...
there
are
seven
in
all...
that
we
challenged.
they
have
produced
a
work
force
that
is
racially
stratified,
and
a
work
force
which
has
jobs
which
even
the
employer
expressly
labels
by
race.
the
employer,
in
its
company
records,
and
in
conversation
among
management
officials,
refer
to
filipino
jobs,
or
filipino
cannery
worker
jobs,
to
the
native-crew,
to
the
filipino
bunkhouse,
to
the
white
mess
house
and
all
of
those
are
amply
documented
in
the
record.
the
phrase
that
the
court
of
appeals
used
in
discussing
this
practice
was
that
it
was
pervasive.
this
is
a
case
of
the
sort
that
we
would
have
expected
to
see
more
reasonably
in
the
late
'60s
or
the
early
'70s,
at
the
dawn
of
title
vii.
it
is,
in
fact,
a
case
that
was
filed
in
the
early
'70s,
in
1974.
the
record,
we
believe,
makes
a
very
strong
showing
of
the
disparate
impact
of
each
of
these
separate
practices.
despite
this,
the
employers
never
really
offered
evidence
that
would
constitute,
in
any
way,
a
business
necessity,
although
there
is
one
finding
on
business
necessity
that
the
district
court
made
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
generally,
the
employer's
evidence
was
not
geared
toward
making
the
type
of
showing
that
this
court
has
recognized
as
justifying
a
disparate
impact.
