justice
antonin
scalia
well,
suppose
i
think
that
your
description
of
the
appropriate
labor
market
is
unrealistic
because
it
takes...
it
assumes
that
you
are
dealing
with
people
who
are
employable
for
a
whole
year,
but
it
is
a
very
distinctive
kind
of
a
character
your
employer
is
looking
for...
he
is
looking
for
somebody
who
will...
needs
work
during
the
spring
and
is
willing
to
take
a
job
to
go
to
alaska
just
during
the
spring
and
not
during
the
rest
of
the
year.
now,
suppose
i
think
for
that
reason
that
your
labor
market
was
not
the
correct
one?
but
i
also
think
that
your
opponent's
labor
market
was
not
the
correct
one...
do
you
win
because
it
is
their
burden
to
establish
a
labor
market?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
were
going
to
say
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
residents
of
ekuk,
how
are
they
broken
up
by
minority
status?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
seems
reasonable
to
me.
i
don't
understand
why
that
is
a
criticism
of
the
fact
that...
you
say
you
can't
attribute
the
high
minority
in
the
cannery
workers
to
the
fact
that
the
union
sends
mainly
filipinos,
i
gather.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
a
lot
of
the
people
are
hired
locally,
but
then
you
tell
me
that
the
people
available
to
be
hired
locally
are
also
minority
people,
not
filipinos,
but
alaskan
natives.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
why
is
that
good
for
you?
i
think
that
is
bad
for
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean
it
seems
to
me
that
this
employer
is
doing
what
a
reasonable
employer
would
do...
he
hires
who
is
available
to
be
hired.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
there
such
skilled
people
available
in
ekuk
or
these
other
towns?
are
there
carpenters
and
so
forth?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
that
mr.
arditi.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
reading
out
the
last
part
of
the
statute.
you
are
saying
that
if
you
simply
segregate
in
a
way
which
would
deprive
or
tend
to
deprive
an
individual
of
employment
opportunities,
that
that's...
that
that's
enough.
it
seems
to
me,
you
have
to
limit,
segregate,
or
classify
because
of
such
individual's
race,
color,
or
religion,
sex
or
national
origin?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
still
in
all,
to
establish
that
the
classification
has
been
because
of
the
race,
color,
religion,
sex,
or
national
origin,
you
have
to
get
to
labor
market.
because
the
mere
fact
that
these
people
turned
out
to
be
segregated
in
jobs
in
this
fashion
doesn't
mean
anything.
it
doesn't
prove
that
they
are
segregated
there
because
of
race,
color,
religion,
sex,
or
national
origin,
unless
you
can
show
by
a
statistical
showing,
compared
to
the
labor
market
that
this
would
be
very
unlikely
to
happen
otherwise.
justice
antonin
scalia
couldn't
have
anything
to
do
with
better
transportation
now,
than
was
the
case
in
1905?
or
the
fact
that
there
are
many
more
whites
in
alaska
now
than
there
were
in
1905?
i
find--
justice
antonin
scalia
--maybe
minorities
were
unduly
favored
in
prior
times.
there
was
no
law
against
that.
maybe
they
worked
for
less.
maybe
there
was
no
unionization,
so
that
the...
so
that
the
fisheries
found
that
they
could
hire
minorities
cheaper.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
mr.
arditi?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
ask
you
about
this
nepotism
thing?
do
you
agree
that
it
is
ultimately
the
plaintiff's
burden
to
show
that
the
reason
for
the,
the
impact
is
racial...
that
it
is
because
of
one
of
the
forbidden
discriminatory
factors?
even
if
you
do
it
by
beginning
with
an
impact,
the
ultimate
thing
that
you
have
to
persuade
the
finder
of
fact
of
is
his
racial
bias,
in
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
the
reason
for
the
disparate
impact
is
racial
bias,
not
that
you
just
have--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
that
is
how
i
take
the
language
"because
of
such
individual's
race,
color,
religion,
sex,
or
national
origin.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
as
far
as
maybe
burden
of
production
is
concerned,
but
i
am
talking
about
ultimate
burden
of
proof.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
it
is
a
violation
of
the
law
if
i
run
a
small
company
and
i
hire
my
own
relatives,
if
that
produces,
if
that
produces
a
work
force
less
than...
that
is
not
divided
racially
the
way
the
labor
market
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
this
is
a
big
business
and
i
have
a
lot
of
relatives.
justice
antonin
scalia
if,
and
i
say
to
my
supervisors,
look
i
want
this
to
be
a
family
kind
of
operation,
you
hire
your
relatives,
too.
and
it
is
not,
you
know,
i
have
no
racial
bias
at
all,
i
just
want
a
family
kind
of
a
place,
and
that
would
be
a
violation
of
law,
then?
