justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
fryer,
i
gather
the
district
court
relied
on
your
expert's
suggestion
of
just
using
census
data
for
a
very
wide
area
of
the
pacific
northwest--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--as
the
relevant
labor
market?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
the
ninth
circuit
rejected
that
and
relied
upon
the
pool
of
workers...
the
cannery
workers
themselves...
and
a
more
restricted
pool
and
said
that
was
determinative,
is
that
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
internal
labor
force
of
the
cannery
workers.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
including
the
cannery
workers.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
if
we
were
to
reject
the
ninth
circuit's
view
of
the
appropriate
pool,
we
then
go
back
to
what
the
district
court
found?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
even
your
expert
said
that
the
figure
should
not
include
college
professors
and
construction
workers
and
other
groups
which
are
not
reasonably
available
for
the
jobs
at
issue.
and
yet,
the
district
court
accepted
that
census
data,
even
though
your
own
expert
said
some
of
these
groups
shouldn't
be
included.
so
what
do
we
do
with
that?
what
if
we
think
the
district
court
erred,
too?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
we
just
accept
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and,
and
the
ninth
circuit
said,
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
relevant
pool
is
all
the
workers?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
nothing
outside?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
is
if
you
say
the
relevant
market
is
the
whole
pacific
northwest
and
you
rely
on
census
data.
this
is
a
disparate
impact
cases
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
in
such
a
case,
do
you
think
that
the
use
of
a
particular
hiring
channel
or
market
can
be
a
facially
neutral
practice
that
is
subject
to
disparate
impact
analysis?
suppose
there
is
an
employer
who
has
the
factory,
in
let's
say
the
harlem
section
of
new
york,
and
that
employer
chooses
to
do
all
of
his
hiring
out
in
westchester
county,
and
the
result
is
largely
a
white
work
force.
now,
is
that
a
practice
subject
to
disparate
impact
analysis?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
is
not
my
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
sot
what
does
the
court
do?
is
the
court's
first
task
to
draw
an
ideal
market
out
of
which
the
employer
must
draw
the
work
force
as
a
means
of
testing
it;
is
that
the
first
step?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
does
the
plaintiff
have
to
go
and
how
does
the
court
get
into
it
on
a
disparate
impact
analysis;
that
is
what
we
have.
what
does
the
plaintiff
have
to
show
for
the
market?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
plaintiff
says,
we
want
to
look
just
at
the
in-house
work
force.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
this
anything
more
than
a
hiring
case?
i
mean
there
are
other
allegations
here,
having
to
do
with
housing
and
the
feeding
arrangements
and
nepotism,
and
one
thing
and
another.
suppose
that
we
were
to
determine...
i
mean
just
make
that
assumption...
that
no
prima
facie
case
was
made
out
here
as
to
the
hiring
claims.
are
there
still
other
claims
on
which
a
remand
is
appropriate.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
status
claims?
i
mean,
is
it
possible
that
housing
people
in
the
fashion
that
was
done
here
could
amount
to
a
status
claim
under
title
vii...
treating
minorities
worse
than
non-minorities
in
housing
and
in
food?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
this
is
now
a
disparate
impact
case,
and
i,
i
gather
from
the
briefs
that
the
respondents
say
somehow
that
if
you
are
right
that
there
was
no
discriminatory
treatment,
that
the
assignment
according
to
neutral
principles,
nevertheless
has
a
discriminatory
impact.
it
treats
them
worse,
because
they
are
minorities.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
think
that
is
all...
that
there
is
nothing
left,
in
and
of
itself,
on
these
other
claims?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
the
respondents
ever
press
those
claims
as
status
claims,
employee
status
claims,
independent
of
hiring?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
your
theory,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
the
district
court
accepted
as
the
relevant
labor
market
this
wide
geographic
area
and
the
census
data
showing
10
percent
minority
population.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
in
the
jobs
at
issue,
the
employer
hires
24
percent
minority
workers,
in
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
say,
gee,
we
are
way
over
the
numbers
and
the
population
so
that
you
lose,
as
a
prima
facie
case
on
disparate
impact.
is
that--
--yes,
but
then
they
say
that
there
are
three
job
categories
so
that
it
works
the
other
way
even
your
own
figures,
as
i
remember.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
does
the
plaintiff
have
the
burden
of
establishing
the
appropriate
labor
market
from
which
the
employer
must
do
the
hiring
for
the
jobs
at
issue?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
who
has
that
burden?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
and
the
district
court
accepted
as
the
relevant
labor
market,
the
whole
pacific
northwest,
using
census
data
figures?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
may
have
a
separate
status
claim
under
that
section
for
housing,
or
feeding,
or
something,
but
we
are
talking
about
hiring,
primarily,
aren't
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
hiring
in
certain
higher
paying
jobs?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
is
what
is
at
issue?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
to
decide
that,
you
think
we
don't...
that
the
court
doesn't
have
to
establish
a
relevant
labor
market
to
look
at
the
figures?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
doesn't
the
court
have
to
do
it
here
for
the
hiring
problem?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
look
just
at
the
cannery
worker
and
other
worker
pool
and
nothing
else?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
is
that
appropriate,
if,
in
fact,
the
employer
hires
from
a
broader
area
and
says,
the
market,
in
fact,
is
from
a
broader
area?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
arditi,
what
if
we
disagree
with
the
ninth
circuit's
look
at
just
the
labor
force
of
this
employer
as
the
source
of
the
employees,
perspectively?
what
if
we
disagree
and
we
think
that
that
was
an
error
as
a
matter
of
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
hazelwood
does
contemplate
the
location
of
a
market
from
which
employees
can
be
drawn?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
u.s.
fish
and
wildlife
service
studies?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
ended
in
1955.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
as
long
as
i
have
you
interrupted--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--this
was
presented
mostly
as
a
hiring
claim,
wasn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
do
we
do
with
these
housing
and
feeding
allegations?
they
were
tried
below
under
the
disparate
treatment
theory
and
you
lost.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
are
they
presented
and
were
they
presented
as
separate
status
claims
of
some
kind?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
regardless
of
hiring?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
still
pursue
those
as
status
claims?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
that
the
findings
of
the
district
court
showed
that
upon
application
at
the
proper
time,
that
the
employer
did
consider
and
receive
and
hire
people
who
had
been
cannery
workers?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
its
findings
covered
that,
for
instance,
mr.
antonio,
himself.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
and
i
thought
that
the
district
court
found
that
some
of
those
were
submitted
at
the
wrong
time,
or
not
actually
submitted,
or
one
thing
or
another?
