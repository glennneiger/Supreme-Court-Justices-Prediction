justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
take
the
labor
force
and
do
what
with
it?
you
would
compare
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
compare
how
many
minorities
were
hired...
compare
that
with
how
many
minorities
there
were
in
the
labor
force?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
not
in
the
labor
force,
the
market.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
do...
would
you
take
the
cannery
and
non-cannery
workers
together
to
compare
with
the
labor
force...
market
statistics,
or
would
you
do
them
separately?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
are
saying
it
is
a
matter
of
law,
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
finding...
in
saying
that
it
must
look
just
to
the
labor
force.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
may
be
making
an
error,
but
you
also
may
be
making
an
error
in
what
you
should
start
off
with.
and
there
only
two
choices...
labor
force
or
labor
market?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
aren't
you
also
saying
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
as
a
matter
of
law
in
what
the
employer
must
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
they
shifted
the
burden
of
proof
incorrectly?
justice
byron
r.
white
those
are
two
legal
issues,
at
least
here,
i
think.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
issue
in
this
case
is
the
non-cannery
positions.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
to
find
out
if
there
is
a
disparate
impact,
you
compare
the
minorities
in
the
labor
force,
the
entire
labor
force,
with
the
minorities
in
the
non-cannery
positions.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
when,
when
you
say
that
they
should
have
compared
the
non-minority
people...
the
minority
people
in
the
non-cannery
positions
with
the
labor
market
composition.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
you
explain
it
very
well.
mr.
fryer,
what
if
i
think
you
are
both
wrong;
how
does
the
case
come
out?
i
mean
what
if
i
check
neither
of
the
above?
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
cannery
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
with
the
housing
and
messing
of
the
cannery
positions?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
not
got
much
time
for
your
other...
if
you
are
going
to
argue
it
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
many
at-issue
jobs
are
you
talking
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no,
just
how,
how
many
at
issue
jobs...
how
many
non-cannery
workers
are
there
in
one
of
these
canneries?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
there
as
many
non-cannery
workers
as
cannery
workers?
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
half
or
what?
vaguely,
just
vaguely--
justice
byron
r.
white
--all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
the
employer
just
has
the
burden
of
production
or
a
burden
of
proof?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
ask
you
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
anyway,
you
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
said
that
you
had
to
prove
what,
a
business
necessity?
