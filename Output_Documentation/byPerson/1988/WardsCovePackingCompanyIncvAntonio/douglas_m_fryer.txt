mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
granted
certiorari
to
review
three
important
questions.
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
questions
in
the
order
presented
in
the
petition.
the
first
question
really
goes
to
the
heart
of
this
case.
and
that
is,
whether
comparative
statistics,
which
show
only
a
racial
imbalance
in
the
work
force
are
to
be
preferred
as
a
matter
of
law,
over
the
trial
court
findings
of
fact
as
to
the
relevant
labor
market.
there
is
a
stark
contrast
between
these
two
measurements.
petitioner's
labor
market
analysis
is
widely
used
in
civil
rights
litigation
and
it
has
been
backed
by
every
level
of
the
federal
judiciary,
including
this
court.
it
is
explicitly
adopted
by
the
very
eeoc
guidelines
which
are
relied
upon
by
the
respondents
in
their
brief.
indeed,
it
is
ironic
that
in
order
to
prevail
in
this
case,
the
respondents,
and
the
amicus
supporting
them,
are
urging
this
court,
to
urge
as
a
matter
of
law
that
one
of
the
most
formidable
tools
that
we
have
to
measure
employment
discrimination,
namely
the
labor
market
analysis,
is
to
be
discarded.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
the
labor
market
analysis
was
based
upon
the
one
percent
sample
from
the
census.
it
was
drawn
from
the
large
geographic
areas,
where
the
employees
were
drawn
from...
from
the
western
united
states,
in
the
areas
that
supplied
people
for
this
industry...
alaska,
oregon,
washington,
and
california.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
that
is
correct.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
that
is
correct.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
that
is
correct.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
the
internal
work
force,
yes.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
the
internal
labor
force,
including
the
cannery
workers.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
yes.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
well,
first
that
is
a
finding
of
fact.
it
has
never
been
challenged.
it
is
clearly
erroneous.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
i
think
the
court
should
just
accept
it.
and
a
person
could,
if
they
wished,
get
into
the
nuances,
the
evidentiary
nuances
as
to
why
or
why
not
some
of
this
labor
market
analysis
might
or
might
not
apply
in
a
given
situation.
but
you
see,
with
the
broad
numbers,
and
the
various
methods
that
dr.
roes
took
into
consideration...
it
really
doesn't
make
any
difference
and
those
are
credibility
arguments.
the
attacks
on
the
statistics
are
credibility
arguments.
the
respondents
did
not
challenge
those
findings
under
the
clearly
erroneous
standard.
they
challenged
those
findings
as
a
matter
of
law.
and--
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
--yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
and
nothing
else.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
we
would
compare
the
employer's
hiring
practices
against
that
measure
of
racial
composition.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
the
labor
market.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
yes.
the
discrete
finding
of
fact
is
finding
of
fact
number
123,
of
the
trial
court.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
well,
you
do
them
separately
but
you
do
them
separately
for
a
distinctive
reason
and
that
is
the
cannery
workers
are
a
part
of
this
labor
force,
tills
labor
supply
for
the
entire
industry.
and
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
ways
the
ninth
circuit
seemed
to
get
off
track
here.
you
have
to
look
at
the
labor
supply
as
a
whole.
now,
there
is
a
very
small
slice
of
that
labor
supply
that
is
represented
by
local
37
of
the
ilwu.
that
is
the
union
that
has
the
contract
for
jurisdiction
over
particular
jobs.
now,
now
the
way
this
industry
operates...
you
have
to
understand
the
way
the
industry
operates
to
understand
the
statistics.
i
think
the
error
of
the
ninth
circuit
was
a
misunderstanding
of
the
industry
which
the
trial
court
apparently
understood
very
well.
now,
the
way
that
people
are
hired
in
this
industry,
first
you
have
to
start
with
the
basics.
the
canneries
are
located
in
remote
areas
of
alaska,
that
is
a
given
fact.
the
seasons
are
short.
they
are
very
intense.
there
is
no
time
during
the
season
to
train
skilled
people.
once
that
cannery
is
in
operation
and
the
fish
are
coming
in,
the
fish
have
got
to
be
canned.
that
season
is
over
in
from
three
weeks
to
two
months.
as
soon
as
the
canning
stops,
the
cannery
workers
go
home,
the
rest
of
the
workers
put
the
cannery
away
and
then
everybody
is
terminated
and
they
return
to
their
homes.
now,
over
the
winter
months,
the
employer
faced
with
this
industrial
situation
has
determined
that
since
he
doesn't
have
time
during
the
season
to
train
people
for
the
skilled
jobs,
he
has
got
to
look
to
a
labor
market
for
those
jobs.
and
it
is
a
given
fact
that
he
has
to
deal
with
that
that
labor
market
is
10
percent
non-white
and
90
percent
white.
that
is--
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
--that
is
correct.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
well,
it
certainly
could
be
subject
to
disparate
treatment
analysis.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
yes--
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
--well,
perhaps,
perhaps
i
could
answer
it
this
way...
for
disparate
impact
we
have
got
to
have
some...
disparate
impact
analysis
is
statistical.
it
has
got
to
be
statistical
on
some
basis.
so,
we
have
to
look
to
some
objective
measure
to
judge
the
employer's
practice.
and
then
the
question
is
what
is
that
measure?
our
case
is
not
a
situation
where
we
look
to
a
discrete
area
dominated
by
whites.
that
is
not
the
situation.
we
look
to
broad
areas
in
the
western
united
states.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
the
plaintiff
has
to
develop
some
measure
of
the
employment
practices,
obviously.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
at
the
internal
work
force,
yes.
and
our
position
is
that
that
is
not
really
relevant.
that
the
internal
work
force
is
only
a
small
measure
of
this
overall
labor
market.
you
seer
it
takes
months
to
fill
the
at-issue
jobs.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
the
at-issue
jobs.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
the
ones
that
issue
in
this
lawsuit...
it
takes
months
to
draw
these
people
in.
when
those
jobs
are
filled--
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
--no,
the
non-cannery
workers,
your
honor.
those
jobs
are
all
t
i
lied
by
early
spring,
after
those
jobs
are
filled
and
attar
those
people
are
sent
to
alaska
to
open
up
the
canneries,
then
local
37
which
has
a
contract,
is
contacted
to
supply
cannery
workers.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
that
was
a
contention
early
on
in
the
case
period,
yes,
it
was.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
i
think
it
is
implicit
in
their
position,
yes,
that...
i
think
it
has
got
to
be
implicit
in
their
position
that
the
employer
should
have
trained
people
in
the
cannery
worker
position
to
take
other
jobs
and
should
have
promoted--
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
--first
of
all,
the
employer
pip
not
promote
from
within
as
a
matter
of
practice,
because
of
these
industrial
circumstances
there
was
just
no
time
to
train
people.
and
because
of
the
lack
of
training,
when
you
needed
the
ability
to
train,
when
you
needed
somebody
you
had
to
go
to
this
outside
labor
market.
those
are
the
facts
of
our
case
and
that
was
our
response.
you
see
it's
not--
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
--yes,
there
is,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
this
was
a
contested
issue
and
it
is
in
the
findings
and
it
is
in
the
80
to
90
series
some
place,
i
believe.
there
is
a
whole
series
of
findings
on
hiring
practices,
that
is
one
of
them.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
i
don't
think
so.
the--
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
--those
claims
were
dismissed
under
the
treatment
analysis
and
that
dismissal
was
affirmed
so
that
the--
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
--well,
i,
i
think
that
the
argument
is
yes,
yes,
that
there
is
impact.
but
it
is
brought
up
in
the
context
of
how
those
practices
may
affect
the
hiring
and
that
is
the
way
that
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
--that
is
the
way
that
the
court
of
appeals
appeared
to
address
it
in
its
last
opinion.
it
said
that--
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
--they
did
press
them
as
status
claims
and
the
district
court
analyzed
those
claims
under
the
disparate
impact
model
as
well
as
the
treatment
model
and
it
found
business
necessity
for
the
housing;
it
also
found
that
the
messing
claims
were
a
matter
of
individual
taste.
the
key
on
messing
is
the
evidence
that
an
employee
could
out
into
another
mess
hall
if
he
so
chose.
so
the
district
court
disposed
of
them
that
way
and
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
appears
to
have
dealt
with
it
on
the
third
opinion
is
to
direct
the
party's
attention
to
those
allegations
as
they
may
have
affected
hiring.
the
court
of
appeals
talks
about
how
the
minorities
may
have
been
deprived
of
the
web
of
information
but
there
was
no
evidence
on
that.
the
specific
finding
of
fact
of
the
trial
court
expressly
states
that
there
was
no
deterrence
to
minorities,
interns
of
applying
for
any
job.
and,
of
course,
that
is
one
of
the
critical
findings
of
fact
of
the
trial
court
that
really
goes
to
all
of
these
allegations.
the
trial
court
made
findings
that
there
was
no
deterrence;
that
each
employee
was
free,
at
any
time,
to
apply
for
any
job
he
wished;
that
the
employees
were
evaluated
on
the
basis
of
job-related
criteria.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
no,
they
were
not,
your
honor,
and
none
challenged
as
such.
now,
the
challenges
were
made
by
the
respondents
as
to
the
findings
being
incorrect,
as
a
matter
of
law,
but
they
were
not
challenged
and
not
held
to
be
clearly
erroneous.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
yes.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
that
is
correct.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
it
was.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
yes,
i
agree.
i
think
so.
i
think
that--
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
--well,
the
error
of
the
district
court
was
as
to
the
legal
theory
on
how
to
deal
with
the
findings.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
our
position
is
that
once
you
have
got
those
findings
in
place,
as
to
the
statistical
results
of
hiring
practices,
once
those
findings
are
made,
it
simply
doesn't
make
any
difference
if
you
change
legal
theory.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
we
did.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
they
did
not
really
seem
to
direct--
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
--yes.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
we
do.
our
position
is
that
if
you
accepted
the
trial
court's
findings,
and
they
are
really
not
challenged,
once
those
findings
are
accepted,
it
simply
does
not
make
any
difference
if
you
change
legal
theories
to
go
to
an
impact
analysis.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
yes.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
that
is
right.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
well,
they
do.
but,
you
see,
all
of
those
three
job
categories
show
is
a
standard
deviation
of
more
than
two
and
less
than
three
which
is
about
what
you
would
expect
if
you
pick
out
about
60
job
classifications.
you
see,
you
figure
that
one
in
20
times,
purely
by
chance,
you
are
going
to
have
the
two
standard
deviations.
now,
secondly,
two
standard
deviations
is
not
equal
to
discrimination.
all
it
infers,
all
it
supports
for
an
inference,
is
that
something
did
not
happen
by
chance.
and
you
see
there
was
other
evidence
that
the
district
court
could
consider
that
these
things
old
not
happen
by
chance.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
well,
that
is
true.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
sure.
we
are
willing
to
take
on
the
inertia.
i
think
the...
i
think
the
court
of
appeals,
the
last
time
around,
was
so
focused
on
the
legal
theory
of
the
subjective
employment
analysis
being
tested
under
the
disparate
impact
model,
that
they
really
didn't
address
the
facts
that
well.
and
if--
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
--absolutely.
that
is
a
flat
out
error
and--
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
--there
are
not
only
two
choices,
but
these
were
the
only
choices
posed
to
the
trial
court
and
you
have
to--
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
--yes,
yes.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
absolutely.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
labor
force
are
those
hired.
the
labor
market
are
the
people
available
for
hiring.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
you
see
the
respondent's
position
is
that
you
look
at
the
labor
force
as
the
measure
of
the
labor
force.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
that
is
correct.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
that
is
correct.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
yes.
with
those
that
were
available.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
you
would
have
to
tell
me
how,
some
how.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
yes.
and
further,--
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
--and
further,
of
course,
if
you
thought
that
was
the
better
source,
i
would
respond
by
saying,
that
is
a
finding
of
fact;
and
we,
we
really
should
leave
that
kind
of
decision
to
the
trial
court.
this
trial
judge
spent
a
lot
of
time
analyzing
this
labor
market
and
the
various
experts,
and
that
is
a
fact-finding
function.
going
to
the
next
question...
well,
i
would
like
to
pause
and
say
one
thing
about
housing
and
messing,
because
i
do
think
that,
again,
there
is
a
lack
of
clarity
on
this.
the
employees
in
the
at
issue
jobs,
more
than
20
percent
of
whom
were
minorities,
were
housed
together
and
fed
together
and
they
worked
together,
side
by
side.
now,
if
it
were
not
for
this
large
number
of
minorities
dispatched
by
local
37,
a
fact
over
which
the
employers
had
no
control--
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
--in
the
cannery
position,
nobody
would
criticize
the
employer's
practices
regarding
housing
and
messing
for
the
at-issue
jobs.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
yes,
yes.
and
our
position
is
that
how
we
fill
the
cannery
worker
jobs
is
simply
irrelevant
to
how
you
are
to
be
judged
as
to
filling
the
at
issue
jobs.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
well,
i
better
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
okay.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
to
respond
to
justice
white's
question,
we
don't
go
quite
as
far
as
the
government
on
point
two,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
is
a
somewhat
extended
discussion
and
perhaps
you
can
refer
to
the
brief.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
you
don't
have
to
decide
that
in
this
case.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
all
right,
our
position
is
that
it
depends
on
the
strengths
of
the
plaintiff's
evidence,
in
a
nutshell.
and
that
is
the
standard
we
have
been
applying
for
civil
litigation
for
probably
200
years...
that
you
weigh
the
strength
of
the
employer's
intermediate
burden,
depending
upon
the
strength
of
what
the
plaintiff
has
come
forward
with.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
we
certainly
do.
well,
first
of
all,
they
ignored
our
evidence
and
they
ignored
our
attacks
on
the
plaintiff's
evidence.
mr.
douglas
m.
fryer
they
said
that
we
had
to
prove
business
necessity
based
solely
on
the
plaintiff's
comparative
statistics.
a
couple
of
things
i
would
like
to
run
over,
the
respondent's,
mr.
arditi,
argued
for
his
labor
market
theory
based
upon
the
history
in
the
industry.
that
was
specifically
rejected...
rejected
by
the
trial
court
in
findings
of
fact.
cannery
workers
are
never
locked
into
any
of
these
jobs;
they
are
free
to
apply
at
the
end
of
the
season
and
they
have
seven
months
to
do
so.
and
the
district
court
found
that
they
were
treated
equally
and
everyone
was
free
to
apply.
contrary
to
mr.
arditi's
statement,
the
trial
court
expressly
found
that
he
could
find
no
deterrence
on
this
record,
although
some
of
those
that
testified,
testified
that
they
felt
they
were
deterred.
in
summary,
i
would
urge
you
to
consider
that
this
employer,
who
has
hired
more
than
the
available
percentage
of
minorities
in
the
at-issue
jobs,
should
not
be
penalized
simply
because
he
has
employed
even
more
in
another
job
classification.
further,
when
you
get
to
the
standard
of
proof
here,
and
what
we
must
examine
the
employer's
practices
by,
i
would
urge
the
court
to
look
at
the
practices
the
employer
actually
did
use,
not
the
practices
the
respondents,
or
the
court
of
appeals,
contend
he
should
have
used.
that
is
simply
speculation.
look
at
this
employer
as
to
how
he
did,
in
fact,
employ
minorities
in
this
industry.
finally,
on
the
multiple
practice
challenge,
which
i
really
didn't
address.
in
a
nutshell,
our
position
on
that
is,
if
the
employees,
if
the
plaintiffs
challenge
an
employer's
practices,
under
the
impact
analysis
by
challenging
the
bottom
line
of
the
total
effect,
of
all
of
the
employer's
practices;
or
if
they
challenge
several
practices,
their
burden
is
still
to
prove
causation.
it
is
implicit
here
that
the
plaintiffs
could
not
prove
causation;
that
is
why
they
have
got
difficulty.
that
is
why
they
go
to
the
employer
and
say,
okay,
mr.
employer,
you
explain
it.
but
that
is
not
how
we
try
civil
cases.
the
plaintiff
has
simply
got
to
prove
his
case;
it
is
his
theory,
it
is
case.
under
the
discovery
standards,
the
information
may
be
possessed
by
the
employer,
but
it
is
equally
available
to
both
sides.
in
conclusion,
i
would
urge
that
this
court
vacate
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
for
entry
of
judgment
in
accordance
with
the
trial
court's
decision.
thank
you.
