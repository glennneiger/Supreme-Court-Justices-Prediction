what
jobs?
chief

issue
in
this
lawsuit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist

you
talking
now
about
the
cannery
workers
or
about
the
non--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--was
there
a
claim
in
this
case,
that
people
who
were
cannery
workers
should
have
been
promoted
to
the
non-cannery
jobs?
chief

william
h.
rehnquist
so
far
as
you
know,
does
the
respondent
still
take
that
position?
chief

william

and
what
was
your
position
in

to
that?
chief

william
h.
rehnquist
were

can
you
describe
in
a
couple
of
senses
the
difference,
as
you
see
it,
between
labor
force
and
labor
market?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
one
of
the
arguments
between
you
is
what
labor
market
you
should
look
to,
to
compare
the
labor
market
with
the
labor
force,
is
that
fair?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.

could
i
ask
first?
do
you
agree
with
the
united
states
on
the
second
issue?
you...
i
guess
you
can
save
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
tell
us
on
rebuttal,
yes.
mr.
arditi?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
opponent
says
that
that
is
because
the
cannery
is
seasonal,
hired
on
the
spot,
and
that
the
others
aren't.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
now
claiming
that
this
finding
is
clearly
erroneous?
are
you
arguing
that
to
us?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
asked
you
if
you
are
now
arguing
to
us
that
that
finding
is
clearly
erroneous?
that
is
a
question
that
can
be
answered
yes
or
no.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
arguing
that
to
us?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
business
did
the
court
of
appeals
have
making
factual
findings
of
its
own,
in
this
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
that
what
you
referred
to,
you
said
that
the
court
of
appeals
found
such
and
such.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
make
its
own
finding,
then?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
arditi.
mr.
fryer,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
