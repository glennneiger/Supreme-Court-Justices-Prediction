mr.
springfield
baldwin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
that
if
the
court
sees
fit
to
reverse
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
8th
circuit,
the
law
of
double
jeopardy
is
going
to
be
about
as
confused
as
i
think
the
argument
i
just
heard
was.
the
facts
in
this
thing
are
simple.
in
fact,
i'm
amazed
that
there
has
been
all
this
commotion
over
this
case.
i
think
since
the
fifth
amendment
was
adopted,
when
a
man
was
convicted
of
what
is
legally
one
crime,
served
one
legal,
lawful
sentence
for
it,
he
was
entitled
to
go
free.
mr.
springfield
baldwin
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
springfield
baldwin
--i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
springfield
baldwin
well,
i
would
say
this.
i
think
one
thing
that
has
been
completely
overlooked
in
this
case
so
far
is
the
effect
of
a
governor's
commutation
of
a
sentence.
when
the
governor
commuted
the
man's
sentence,
then
the
legal
position
in
missouri
and
in,
i
think,
the
universal
law,
accord...,
at
least
according
to
american
jurisprudence,
is
that
the
man's
legal
position
is
the
same
as
if
he
had
been
originally
sentenced
to
that
length
of
time.
now
this
court,
in
whalen
v.
the
united
states,
held
that,
uh,
where
there
is
a
felony
murder
the
underlying
felony
is
a
lesser-included
defense,
and
unless
the
legislative
body
had
decided
there
should
be
multiple
punishment,
there
should
not
be
one.
it
was
one
crime.
and
this
man
committed
one
crime.
they
call
it
first-degree
murder.
but
it
is
the
codification
of
the
old
felony
murder.
he
received
the
robbery
sentence.
he
apparently
was
a
very
good
boy
in
prison
and
so
forth.
we
are
not
informed
as
to
why
the
governor
commuted
his
sentence,
but
i
know
from
the
motions
i
had
to
file
to
get
that
writ
of
habeas
corpus
that
he
had
completed
his
high
school
equivalency,
had
completed,
uh,
two
years
of
college
with
grades
of
a
and
b.
uh,
and
he
is
now
living
with
his
sister,
the
school
teacher,
and
is
now
employed.
uh,
my
opponent
said
there
would
be
no
problem
if
he
had
only
been
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
first
and
not
the
15
year
sec...
not
the
15
years
first.
that,
i
submit,
is
not
true.
because
no
matter
which
he
had
been
sentenced
to
first,
when
the
governor
commutes
one
of
them,
he
has
served
one
complete,
legitimate
sentence.
uh,
the
concept
of
lange,
lange
definitely
held.
mr.
springfield
baldwin
that
is
true.
uh,
it
is--
mr.
springfield
baldwin
--yes,
i
would.
mr.
springfield
baldwin
because
the
governor
says
so.
he
says
his
time
shall
on
that
sentence
shall
end
as
of
such
and
such
a
date.
mr.
springfield
baldwin
i
would
believe
it
is.
i
mean,--
mr.
springfield
baldwin
--i
think
that's
true.
mr.
springfield
baldwin
yes,
it
was
not
a
complete
pardon.
mr.
springfield
baldwin
that's
right.
mr.
springfield
baldwin
i
do
not
know.
uh,
lange
was
a
case
where
a
man
had
been
stealing
mail
bags
and,
uh,
the
district
court
sentenced
him
contrary
to
the
statute
to
two
sentences.
the
statute
provided
he
could
be
fined
or
imprisoned.
and
the
judge
assessed
both
against
him.
the
lawyer
ran
in
and
paid
the
fine.
and
the
supreme
court
said,
the
judgment
is
satisfied.
it
was
a
legitimate
alternative
penalty
of
the
law
and
he
satisfied,
and
it's
over.
he's
to
be
discharged.
a
double
jeopardy
clause,
of
course,
applies
to
the
states
as
held
in
benton
v.
maryland
by
this
court.
and
now,
that,
that,
uh,
the
respondent
larry
thomas
has
served
one
legitimate
sentence
for
his
felony
murder,
he
is
entitled
to
be
discharged.
and
i
think
that's
pretty
open
and
shut.
now,
if
you
want
to
abandon
that,
you
are
really
going
to
foul
up
the
law
of
double
jeopardy.
and
i
don't
think
anybody
is
going
to
know
what
it
means
in
the
future.
uh,
my
opponent
said
that
the
time
that
he
had
served
on
his
15
year
sentence
was
credited.
now
the
missouri
court
of
appeals
did
say
that
it
had
been
credited.
but
when
i
read
the
lower
courts,
the
missouri
circuit
court's
judgment
on
a
2726,
i
did
not
see
where
it
mentioned
that
it
was
crediting
that
time.
but--
mr.
springfield
baldwin
--mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
we
have
the
lange
decision
of
115
years
ago,
and
then,
uh,
the
next
thing
we
have
is,
uh,
i
think,
uh,
united
states
versus
benz,
which
was
to
the
same
effect.
and
that
was
in
1930.
then
we
have
in
re
bradley,
which
was
in
1943.
bradley,
of
course,
was
convicted
of
a
contempt
of
court
for
threatening
a
witness
in
the
corridor
of
the
courthouse,
fined
and
sentenced
to
jail.
his
lawyer
paid
the
fine,
and
uh,
the
court
said
he
had
satisfied
the
judgment.
here,
this
defendant
was
charged
with
robbery,
first-degree,
and
he
was
charged,
i
mean,
with
attempted
robbery,
and
he
was
charged
with
felony
murder.
he
was
convicted.
judgment
was
entered
on
two
counts,
and
he
could
have
been
sentenced
to
either
one.
and
he
was
sentenced
to
both.
i
see
no
difference
in
principle
between
the
fact
that
there
were
alternative
penalties.
when
he
served
one,
he
had
satisfied
the
judgment.
and,
uh,
this
kind
of
law
has
been
the
law
of
this
nation,
i
think,
since
the
beginning.
furthermore,
i
would
really
like
to
emphasize,
too,
the
effect
of
the
governor's
commutation.
i'd
like
to
make
the
analogy.
suppose
that
there
was
a
federal
prisoner.
and
under
the
law
that
passed,
congress
passed,
some
district
court
judge
had
sentenced
him
to
forty
years,
and
two
days
later
the
president
of
the
united
states,
under
his
power
to
pardon
or
reprieve,
did
one
or
the
other
so
that
the
man
went
free,
would
the
court
then
say,
oh,
the
trial
judge
intended
he
serve
40
years.
congress
intended
that
he
serve
40
years.
we'll
just
set
that
first
40
year
sentence
aside
and
we'll
then
reinstate
it.
that
way
we
get
around
the
president's
pardon
or
reprieve.
and
so
it's
only
fair
that
he
serve
40
years.
i
don't
think
you
would
do
that.
mr.
springfield
baldwin
i
don't
think
it
decided
that.
i
think
it--
mr.
springfield
baldwin
--then
he
could
only
be
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment--
mr.
springfield
baldwin
--well,
if
the
missouri
supreme
court
had
decided
what
you
suggest,
then
it
would
be,
uh,
i
think,
a
void
sentence
to
sentence
him,
uh,
for
both.
that's
not
this
case.
mr.
springfield
baldwin
that's
right.
mr.
springfield
baldwin
no,
i
don't,
because
it
has
been
the
precedent
as
set
in
ex
parte
lange
that
the
sentences
in
that
case,
the
sentences
in,
in,
uh,
in
re
bradley,
the
sentences
in
united
states
v.
benz,
were
voidable,
not
void.
so,
since
they
were
voidable,
i
do
not
see
any
reason
that
the
governor
or
missouri
could
not
commute
one
of
them
and
when
he
does
so,
he
has
served
a
complete
sentence
for
his
crime.
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
i
think,
too,
that--
mr.
springfield
baldwin
--then
you're
getting
in,
i
believe,
to
a
different
class
of
cases.
there
is
a
class
of
cases
where
the
defendant
has
not
finished
the
sentence.
he's
received
two
sentences.
he
should
have
only
received
one.
and
neither
has
been
completed.
this
court
and
other
federal
courts,
i
don't
know,
i
think
this
court,
but
i
know
other
federal
courts
have
held
the
trial
judge
may
then
make
a
choice
between
the
two.
uh,
vacate
one
and
give
him
the
other.
that's
the
way
i
understand
it.
mr.
springfield
baldwin
i
believe
in
those
cases
that
justice
scalla,
i
believe,
inferentially
referred
to,
that
that
is
double
jeopardy
law,
because
i
believe
the,
the
defendants
in
those
cases
have
maintained
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
was
being
violated
by
the
court
not
doing
what
they
wanted.
whereas,
the
courts
have
said,
in
that
situation
it's
what
the
trial
judge
wants.
so
i
think
double
jeopardy
has
been
an
issue
in
those.
and,
uh,
i
believe
during
argument
in
the
court,
in
the
8th
circuit,
i
pointed
out
that
the,
uh,
the
attorney,
assistant
attorney
general
had,
uh,
not
cited
a
single
case
in
point
on
these
facts.
and,
uh,
i
don't
think
he
has
yet.
it's
a
princi...
it's
a
legal
principal
that's
endured,
i
would
believe,
for
centuries.
and,
i
don't
know
why
it
should
be
changed.
if
it
is
true,
and
i
believe
it
is,
that
the
founding
fathers
put
the
first
ten
amendments
in
the
constitution
to
restrain
the
power
of
courts
and
i
respectfully
submit
you
should
be
restrained
and
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
8th
circuit.
i
think
there's
another
reason.
if
the
governor
of
missouri
wanted
to
commute
this
man's
sentence,
he
gave
him
a
present,
so
to
speak.
he
may
not
have
realized
he
was
giving
him
a
present,
but
he
gave
him
one.
and
now
you
are
asked
to
reach
back
in
time
and
make
the
position
of
the
prisoner
more
onerous.
now
my
opponent
says,
i
say
that's
a
ex
post
facto
type
judgment,
which
is
forbidden
by
the
due
process
clause
according
to
your
case
of
boule
v.
city
of
columbia.
my
opponent
says
that
point
was
not
raised
originally
and
cannot
now
be
raised
because
it's
a
matter
of
procedural
default.
i
say
that
since
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
was
for
the
prisoner,
that
i
can
cite
that
as
a
reason
to
support
that
judgment.
i
don't
think
you
have
to
cross-appeal.
i
don't
think
you
have
to
do
anything.
uh,
i
mean,
just
to
be
absurd,
if,
uh,
it
was
proposed
that
you
engage
in
104
constitutional
violations,
uh,
and
i
argued,
uh,
oh,
that's
all
right
because
it
wasn't
raised
in
the
court
below,
that's
pretty
silly.
uh,
and
here
it
is
proposed
that
you
enter
an
ex
post
facto
judgment
which
you
have
said
violates
due
process.
and,
uh,
i
might
point
out,
of
course,
that
the
various
united
states
courts
of
appeals
have
followed
these
cases
of
ex
parte
lange,
in
re
bradley,
united
states
versus
benz,
and
we
have
their
cases
that
are
right
in
line.
and
you
are
just
going
to
upset
the
whole
thing
if
you
reverse
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
uh,
besides,
you
are
going
to
really
be
holding
the
missouri
governor's
power
to
commute
sentences
for
nought,
because
that's
going
to
be
taken
away
from
him.
he
no
longer
has
that.
he
no
longer
can
say,
i
served
that
sentence.
no
doubt
taking
that
away
from
him
makes
his
situation
more
onerous.
uh,
you
pointed
out
in
weaver
versus
graham
that
when
florida
enacted
a
statute
that
took
away
good
time,
it
was
an
ex
post
fact
statute
as
far
as
those
prisoners
who
had
earned
good
time
under
that,
and
made
their
condition
more
onerous.
and
you
held
it
was
unconstitutional.
you,
uh,
had
somewhat
the
same,
uh,
situation,
well,
not
really,
but
you
had
an
ex
post
facto
judgment
in
that
boule
versus
the
city
of
columbia.
there
two
blacks
went
into
a
drugstore,
sat
at
a
counter
where
they,
or
sat
in
a
booth,
where
they
might
be
served
food.
in
those
days
in
south
carolina,
places
were
not
serving
blacks.
and
they
didn't
actually
refer,
uh,
refuse
to
serve
them.
what
they
actually
did
was
they
asked
them
to
leave.
the
statute
said
that,
uh,
if
you
enter
upon
a
landowner's
property
without
his
consent
where
you
have
received
notice
that
you
shall
not
enter,
then
that's
some
kind
of
a
crime.
and
the
south
carolina
court
interpreted
this
statute
to
add
this
additional
business
which
wasn't
in
it,
that
if
you
are
asked
to
leave,
you
violated
that
statute.
and
they,
you're,
this
court
said
that's
not
so.
that's
an
ex
post
facto
judgment.
and
that's
that
you're
doing
when
you
take
this
commuted
sentence
away
and
say
it's
of
no
effect.
the
simple
thing
is
that
once
in
a
while,
under
the
constitution,
things
happen
that
courts
don't
like.
and
i
think
that
there
is
where
you
have
to
decide
you'll
be
restrained.
so,
i
would
ask
that
you
affirm
the
judgment.
