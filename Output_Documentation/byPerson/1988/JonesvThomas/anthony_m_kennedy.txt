justice
kennedy
the
murder
conviction
remains
undisturbed,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
kennedy
well,
when
a
sentence
is
commuted,
why
is
that,
uh,
equivalent
to
having
the
sentence
be
served?
you
say
when
the
sentence
is
commuted
that
he
served
the
sentence.
justice
kennedy
suppose
he'd
begun,
suppose
he
was
serving
the
sentence
for
life
first
and
the
governor
said,
by
the
way,
i'm
going
to
commute
your
second
sentence.
you
wouldn't
say
that
that
sentence
had
been
served,
would
you?
justice
kennedy
why?
justice
kennedy
well,
perhaps
i
don't
understand
what
a
commutation
is.
is
a
commutation
in
that
respect
different
than
a
pardon,
i
take
it?
justice
kennedy
the
effect
of
it
is
is
that
the
sentence
simply
doesn't
have
to
be
served.
