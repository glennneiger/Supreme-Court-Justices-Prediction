justice
scalia
does
that
mean
that
if
i
get,
if
i
get
sentenced,
uh,
for
a
particular
crime
for
five
years,
uh,
and,
uh,
then
under
a
statute
that
allows
five
to
20,
and
the
trial
judge
later
has
second
thoughts,
uh,
he
can
call
me
back
and
give
me
another
10?
think
that's
all
right?
justice
scalia
or
even
a
different
trial
judge
calls
me
back
and
gives
me
another
10.
that's
okay,
because
we
haven't
exceeded
what
the
legislature
intended.
justice
scalia
i
don't
think
it's
close
at
all.
that's,
that's
the
problem.
justice
scalia
expectancy
is
not
to
be
punished
a
second
time
for
the
same
offense.
and
here
he
was
sentenced
and
punished
once,
and
you
are
saying,
despite
your
expectation
that
you
were
sentenced
and
punished
and
once,
we're
going
to
bring
you
back
and
sentence
you
again
because
you
got
off
on
the
other
one.
justice
scalia
expectancy
for
the
defense
was
to
serve
15
years
or
as
much
less
as
he
could
get
off
with
if
he,
if
he
came
under
the
governor's
commutation
program.
wasn't
that
his
expectancy
on
this
offense?
justice
scalia
not
on
the
single
offense.
justice
scalia
when
he
was
sentenced.
what
do
you...
did
he
get
the
two
terms
for
the,
for,
for
a
single
offense?
justice
scalia
well,
i
think
we
are
playing
games
here.
uh,
i
think
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
the
same
offense.
he
was
originally
sentenced
for
two
different
offenses.
then
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
said
no,
you
can't,
you
can't
prosecute
under
two
different
statutes
for
this
one,
for
this
one,
uh,
offense,
and
therefore,
only
the
first
offense
stands.
and
his
expec...
his
expectation
under
that
first
offense,
it
seems
to
me,
was
15
years.
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
what
if
he
hadn't
finished
his
15
years,
or,
uh,
and
there
had
been
no
commutation?
justice
scalia
mr.
hawke,
i
suppose
your
case
really
depends
upon
whether
that's
really
true,
that
all
that
the,
all
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
provides
for
is
no
more
penalty
than
is
authorized
by
the
legislature.
and
i'm,
i'm,
i'm
just
not
sure
that's
true.
uh,
again,
what
do
you
do
about
the
situation
where
a
judge
makes
a
mistake
in
sentencing
and
the
fellow
serves
the
sentence
and
then
the
judge
says,
gee,
i
made
a
mistake
and
he
sentences
him
for
the
rest
of
what
the
legislature
authorized.
would
you
say
that
double
jeopardy
clause
does
not
cover
that?
justice
scalia
that's
right.
and
that,
that's,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
intent
of
the
legislature,
though.
justice
scalia
you,
you,
you
may
be
right
about
that,
mr.
hawke,
but
how
does
that
respond
to
justice
scalla's
question?
you're
saying
that
as
long
as
it,
it
doesn't
defeat
his
expectations,
it's
okay.
but
before,
you
said
flatly,
that
as
long
as
the
combined
sentences
don't
exceed
what
the
legislature
was
willing
to
permit,
it
was
all
right.
justice
scalia
well,
i
think
maybe
you
have
to
look
at
more
than
just
his
expectations
plus
the
legislature's
intent
as
well.
suppose
the
sentencing
judge
says,
i'm
going
to
give
you
eight
years
right
now.
i'm
really
not
sure
that's
going
to
be
enough
for
you.
i'll
think
some
more
about
it,
and
i
may
impose,
may
impose
a
further
sentence
down
the
line.
do
you
think
that
would,
uh,
be
sustainable
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause?
justice
scalia
well,
it
tests
whether
his
expectations
are
what
govern.
i
mean,
when
you're
talking
about
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
you're
talking
about
a
very
technical
provision.
i
mean
the
fact
that
it
has
some
fluky
consequences
doesn't
surprise
me
any.
it,
it
is
in
its
nature
a
technicality.
