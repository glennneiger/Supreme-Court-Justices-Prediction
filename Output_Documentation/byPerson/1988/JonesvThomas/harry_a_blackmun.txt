well,
in
this
case
it
was
commuted
to
time
served,
wasn't
it?
justice
blackmun
that,
that
sounds
to
me,
uh,
in,
as
a
distinction
from
a
complete
pardon.
justice
blackmun
mr.
baldwin,
how
did
these
commutations
come
about?
was
this
the
only
case
which
governor
bond
exercises
commutation
power
or
were
there
a
string
of
them
at
the
same
time?
