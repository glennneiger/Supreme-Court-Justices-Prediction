justice
o'connor
why
was,
why
were
these
repeated
actions
taken
after
it
had
already
been
decided?
i,
i
just
didn't
understand
why
we
had
two
additional
proceedings
after
it
had
already
been
resolved.
justice
o'connor
i
guess
you
didn't
understand
my
question.
i
didn't
understand
why
there
was
a
commutation
and
then
later
this
second
proceeding
to
set,
set
it
aside.
