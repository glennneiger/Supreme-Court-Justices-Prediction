justice
white
--question,
isn't
it?
justice
white
well,
but
it
gave
the
answer.
the
answer
was
no.
justice
white
it's
never
been
expressly
questioned,
has
it?
justice
white
what
if
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
had
held
in
this
case
that,
uh,
that,
uh,
when
you
have
a,
uh,
felony
murder
like
this,
uh,
and
there's
a,
and
a
jury
is
instructed
that
they
can
find
one
or
the
other
or
both,
and
the
jury
comes
in
and
finds
both,
what
if
a,
what
if
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
had
decided
that,
that
the,
the
man
could
only
be
sentenced
to
the
life,
to
life
imprisonment?
justice
white
well,
know.
but
what
if
it
had?
what
if
it
had?
justice
white
well,
i
know.
but
then,
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
he,
he
had
been
sentenced
to
both
and
he
had
served
his
15
year
sentence.
don't
you
think
the,
uh,
surely
then,
uh,
he
could
be
left
in
jail
on
the
grounds
that
uh,
uh,
the
only
sentence
that
he
could
have
been
sentenced
to,
really,
was
the
life.
justice
white
so
the
15
year,
the
15
year
sentence
would
just
have
been
void.
justice
white
right.
you
don't
think
that's
even
close
to
this
case.
