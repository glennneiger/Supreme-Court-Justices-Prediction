mr.
stephen
d.
hawke
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
to
understand
the
double
jeopardy
issue
and
to
understand
the
federalism
issue
before
the
court
today,
it
is
necessary
to,
uh,
to
discuss
briefly
the
facts
that
have
led,
the
15
years
of
facts
that
have
lead
up
to
this,
to
the
present
appeal.
in
november
of
1972,
the
respondent,
in
an
attempted
robbery
and
in
in
the
city
of
st.
louis,
killed
a
fellow
named
mentoe
vernell.
the
next
spring,
in
may
of
'73,
the
respondent
was
found
guilty
in
the
circuit
court
of
the
city
of
st.
louis.
the
judge
sentenced
the
respondent
to
15
years
imprisonment
for
the
attempted
robbery
conviction
and
to
life
imprisonment
for
the
first-degree
murder
conviction,
those
sentences
to
run
consecutively
and
in
that
order.
in
other
words,
15
years,
and
once
the
15
years
is
complete,
then
service
of
the
life
sentence
begins.
in
1975,
the
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
missouri
court
of
appeals.
two
years
later,
in
1977,
the
respondent
initiated
a
post-conviction
action
in
the
circuit
court
of
the
city
of
st.
louis.
a
post-conviction
action
in
state
court
in
the
state
of
missouri
is
called
a
2726
motion,
and
we'll
probably
refer
to
it
as
that
today.
in
the
year
1980
and
in
1981,
the
missouri
supreme
court
issued
two
opinions
in
cases
called
state
v.
olds
and
state
v.
morgan.
in
those
cases,
the
missouri
supreme
court
determined
that
the
missouri
legislature
did
not
intend
that
there
be
multiple
punishments,
did
not
intend
that
the,
that,
that,
that
defendants
be
punished
twice
for
felony
murder
and
underlying
felony.
shortly
after
those
opinions,
on
march
27,
1981,
the
2726
motion,
the
pcr
motion,
was
amended
to
include
a
double
jeopardy
claim
on
the
basis
of
state
v.
morgan
and
state
v.
olds.
later
that
year,
three
months
later
in
june
16,
1981,
then
governor
christopher
bond
issued
a
commutation
to
the
respondent
for
the
attempted
robbery
conviction
and
sentence.
one
year
later,
june
of
1982,
the
circuit
court
of
the
city
of
st.
louis
granted
respondent's
motion
for
2726
relief.
the
attempted
robbery
conviction
and
sentence
were
vacated.
mr.
stephen
d.
hawke
okay.
olds
and
morgan
are
collateral
proceedings.
they
involve
completely
different
defendants,
and
it
was
not
until
after
morgan
and
olds
were
decided
by
the
missouri
supreme
court
that
the
2726
motion
was
amended
to,
to
include
a
double
jeopardy
claim.
before
morgan
and
olds,
there
was
no,
there
was
no
indication
in
the
missouri
jurisprudence
that
there
was
a,
there
potentially
could
be
a
double
jeopardy
problem
here.
in
fact,
in
state
versus
overstreet,
the
missouri
supreme
court
indicated
that
there
was
no
double
jeopardy
problem.
mr.
stephen
d.
hawke
okay.
when
the
2726
motion
was
initially
filed
in
1977,
it
was
denied.
the
denial
went
up
on
appeal
to
the
missouri
court
of
appeals
and
was
remanded
back
to
the
circuit
court
of
the
city
of
st.
louis
because
there
was
an
incomplete
record
for
the,
for
the
missouri
court
of
appeals
to
consider
the
2726
appeal.
the
governor's
commutation
is
completely
separate.
it
is
completely
different.
there
is
no,
i
do
not
believe
that
there's
any
relationship
between
the
governor's
commutation
and
the
double
jeopardy
claim.
during
the
late
70s
and
early
80s,
uh,
there
was
a
program
with
the
missouri
department
of
corrections
where
governors
commutations
were
issued
where
a
prisoner
serves
seven-twelfths
of
his
time
in
a
peaceable
manner.
and
there
is
discussion
of
that
old
governor's
commutation
program
in
cases
called
love
v.
black
and
parrish
v.
wyrick,
which
i
believe
are
cited
in
brief,
uh,
on,
in
the
main
brief.
but
the,
but
to
answer
your
question
directly,
there
is,
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
relationship
between
the
commutation
and
the
litigation
in
the
circuit
court
of
the
city
of
st.
louis.
the
2726
relief
was
granted
by
the
st.
louis
city
circuit
court.
the
attempted
robbery
conviction
and
sentence
were
vacated
and
held
for
nought.
the
respondent
appealed
to
the
missouri
court
of
appeals
arguing
that
the
attempted,
that
the
first-degree
murder
conviction
need
to
be
vacated
as
well.
the
missouri
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
denial
of
relief
and
held
the
procedures
used
by
the
rule
27.26
circuit
court
did
not
prejudice
the
respondent.
with
those
facts
in
mind,
it
is
now
necessary
to
examine
what
exactly
happened
in
the
courts
below,
the
federal
court
below,
after
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
filed.
and
in
the
appeal
to
the,
uh,
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
8th
circuit.
as
the
court
knows,
in
a
panel
opinion
there
were
three
different
opinions
issued
by
the
panel,
uh,
the
effect
of
which
were
to,
uh,
rule
that
a
double
jeopardy
violation
existed
but
to
remand
the
case
to
the
state
court
to
determine
if,
if
the
double
jeopardy
violation
could
be
cured.
the
8th
circuit
sitting
en
banc
reheard
the
case
and
ruled
on
a
five
to
four
decision
that
the
respondent's
double
jeopardy
rights
were
violated.
with
this
background
and
procedure
in
mind,
it's
now
necessary
to
examine
exactly
the,
what
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
8th
circuit
ruled
and
to
examine
whether
or
not
the
respondent's
double
jeopardy
rights
have
been
violated.
the
court
of
appeals
ruling
held
for
nought
the
litigation
that
occurred
in
the,
in,
in
the
state
court.
held
for
nought
the
litigation
that
vacated
the
multiple
punishment.
for
the
respondent
to
be
entitled
to
federal
habeas
corpus
relief,
he
must
demonstrate
that
he
is
"in
custody
in
violation
of
the
constitutional
laws
or
treaties
of
the
united
states.
"
that
is
the
language
of
the
habeas
corpus
statute.
now,
the
respondent
attempts
to
invoke
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the,
of
the
constitution,
as
this
court
noted
in
north
carolina
v.
pearce,
protects
against
reconviction
after
an
acquittal,
mind
that's
not
the
situation
here.
it
protects
against,
uh,
uh,
a
reconviction
after,
after
a
conviction.
it
prohibits
reprosecution
after
a
conviction.
that's
not
the
situation
here.
north
carolina
v.
pearce
also
describes
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
precludes
multiple
punishment.
this
court
in
its,
has
described
what
it
means
by
multiple
punishment
in
a
series
of
cases
from
back
in
the
early
80s
in
difrancesco,
in
whalen
and
in
missouri
v.
hunter.
this
court
has
described
the
multiple
punishment
aspect
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
as
prohibiting
punishment
that
is
in
excess
of
what
the
legislature
intended.
in
this
situation,
the
legislature--
mr.
stephen
d.
hawke
--it
depends
on
the
context
of
what
you
are
describing.
mr.
stephen
d.
hawke
i,
i,
that's,
that
is
a
close
question.
i--
mr.
stephen
d.
hawke
--what
you
have,
what
you
are
looking
at
there
is
the,
at
the
expectancy
of
the
defendant.
in
the
difrancesco
case,
the
court,
uh,
affirmed
a
procedure
where
the
court
of
appeals
could
increase
the
punishment
because
the
defendant's
expectation,
uh,
uh,
of
finality
in
the
punishment
was
not
brought
in
the
question.
if
the
defendant
is
just
brought
in
five
years
later
and
the
trial
judge
says,
well,
i'm
going
to
increase
your
sentence
to
20
because
for
whatever
reason,
i,
i
believe
that,
i
believe
that
the
defendant's
expectancy
in
punishment
would
certainly
be
implicated
here.
mr.
stephen
d.
hawke
in
this
particular
case,
when
the
defendant
was
sentenced,
his
expectancy
was
to
serve
15
years
imprisonment
followed
by
a
term
of
life
imprisonment.
his,
when
he
filed
a
rule
2726
motion
in
state
court,
that--
mr.
stephen
d.
hawke
--on
this
offense,
when
he
was
sentenced,
he
had
the
expectancy
of
serving
15
years
followed
by
a
life
term.
mr.
stephen
d.
hawke
when
he
was
sentenced.
mr.
stephen
d.
hawke
he
received
two
terms
for
the,
uh,
for
the
attempted
robbery.
but
at
that
time,
at
the
time
he
was
sentenced,
there
was,
there
was,
there
was
no,
there
was
no
way
for
him
to
predict
morgan
and
olds
would
come
down.
his
subjective
expectation
at
the
time
he
was
sentenced
was
to
serve
15
years
followed
by
a
life
term.
when
he
initiated
a
rule
2726
motion,
the
multiple
punishment
that
had
become
exposed
under
morgan
and
olds
was
revealed.
and
the
sentence
was
lowered
from
15
years
followed
by
a
life
to
a
term
of
life
imprisonment.
as
a
term
that
is
authorized
by
the
missouri
legislature.
so,
under
this
court's
juris--
mr.
stephen
d.
hawke
--i,
uh,
i,
i
must
respectfully
disagree.
at
the
time
he
was
sentenced,
his
subjective
expectation
was
to
serve
15
followed
by
life.
and,
even
if
you
were
to
look
at
it
from
the
way
that
you
descri...
the
way
that
you
described
it,
he
could
expect
to
serve,
his
legitimate
expectation
would
have
been
to
have
served
15
years
or
a
life
term.
and
in
this
situation,
he
is
going
to
serve
a
life
term.
now
that
fulfills
his,
uh,
any,
the
objective
expectation
that
you
are
describing
there.
mr.
stephen
d.
hawke
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
the
state
statute
for
attempted
robbery
set
as
a
maximum
sentence
15
years
imprisonment.
uh,
the
respondent
was
sentenced
maximum
term
15
years.
so,
uh,
i,
i
don't,
i,
in
your
situation,
i
do
not
believe
they,
that,
that
the
judge
could
have
done
that
because
the
sentence
would
have
been
in
excess
of
what
the,
of
what
the,
uh,
legislature
intended.
mr.
stephen
d.
hawke
the
attempted
robbery
conviction
was
what
was
set
aside
by
the
state
court.
mr.
stephen
d.
hawke
that
is
correct.
the
cases
that
are
primarily
relied
upon
by
the,
by
the,
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
8th
circuit
are
cases
called
lange
and
bradley.
in
lange,
i
believe
that
you
can
read
lange
as
consistent
with
the
court's
opinions
in
whalen
and
in
hunter
and
the
other,
and,
and
the
other
ca...
difrancesco.
in,
in,
in
the
lange
case
the
defendant
was
sentenced
to
a
term
that
was
not
authorized
by
the
statute.
the
sentencer,
uh,
sentenced
the
defendant
to
a
term,
to
a
term
and
to
a
fine
where
the
statute
only
authorized
a
sing...,
an
alt...,
one
or
the
other,
a
fine
or
a
term
imprisonment.
so,
lange
certainly
stands
for
the
proposition
that
the
sentencer
cannot
sentence,
uh,
a
defendant
to
a
term
greater
than
what
the
legislature
authorizes.
bradley,
the
other
case
relied
upon
by
the
8th
circuit,
is
in--
mr.
stephen
d.
hawke
--there
is
language
to
that
effect
in--
mr.
stephen
d.
hawke
--i,
i
must
respectfully
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
i
think
that
there
is
language
to
that
effect
in
lange,
but
i
believe
that
language
would
be
dicta.
mr.
stephen
d.
hawke
i
believe
that
the
case
hold,
holding
is
the
same
as
in
whalen,
difrancesco
and
hunter,
that
the
sentencer
cannot
sentence
a
defendant
to
a
term
greater
than
what
the
legislature
authorized.
mr.
stephen
d.
hawke
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
d.
hawke
no,
that
is
not.
mr.
stephen
d.
hawke
but
the
amount
of
time
that
is
authorized
by
the
missouri
legislature
is
a
term
of
life
imprisonment
for,
for
a
murder
conviction.
the
defendant
has
not
been
sentenced
to
any
term
greater
than
life
imprisonment.
mr.
stephen
d.
hawke
in
that
situa...
in
that,
in
lange,
your
honor,
the
defendant
was
sentenced
to
a
term,
uh,
to
a
term
of,
uh,
uh,
of,
uh,
well,
to
a
term
and
to
a
fine.
mr.
stephen
d.
hawke
and
once
he
paid
the
fine,
then,
then
the
courts
held
that,
that,
that
the
defendant
could
not
be
required
to
serve
prison
time.
now--
mr.
stephen
d.
hawke
--the
key
here,
your
honor,
i
believe,
is
that
the
defendant,
that
the
defendant's
time
for
the
attempted
robbery
charge
was
credited,
once
the
attempted
robbery
sentence
was
vacated.
the
time
that
he
had
served
was
credited
towards
completion
of
the
first-degree
murder
conviction
and
sentence.
so,
you
don't
have
multiple
punishments
here.
you
have,
you
have
a
single
punishment.
this
defendant--
mr.
stephen
d.
hawke
--well,
that
was
the
situation
that
the
court
was
faced
with
in
bradley.
uh,
and--
mr.
stephen
d.
hawke
--they
gave
an
answer
to
that
question
that
is
inconsistent
with
this
court's
jurisprudence
with
double
jeopardy.
mr.
stephen
d.
hawke
that
is
gave
an
answer
and
an
answer
that
was
unsupported
by,
by
case
law,
except
for
the
dicta
in
lange
and
it
provide,
it
provide,
the
holding,
that
particular
holding
in
bradley
has
not
been
followed
by
this
court
since
then.
mr.
stephen
d.
hawke
uh,
it
has
been
expressly
questioned
by
the
lower
courts.
but
it
has
not
been,
it
has
not
been
expressly
questioned
before
this
court
until
today.
now,
the,
the
language
that
you
are
referring
to
is
the
language
that
says,
when
an
alternative
term
is,
uh,
uh,
uh,
an
alternative
term
of
punishment
has
been
completed,
then
the
power
to
sentence
or
to
punish
is
over.
now
that
does
not
fit
in
to
this
court's
description
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
uh,
since,
since
the
bradley
case.
mr.
stephen
d.
hawke
uh,
yes.
he
had
commuted
about
a
year
early.
mr.
stephen
d.
hawke
he,
uh,
that
is
correct.
they,
they
con...,
uh,
it
was
vacation
of
a
conviction
that
had
already
been
served.
that
is
not
unprecedented.
there,
in,
in
missouri--
mr.
stephen
d.
hawke
--it's
a
situation
where
missouri
remedies
exist
where
defendants
can
vacate,
uh,
convictions
that
have
already
been
served.
in
missouri
procedure
we
have
a
procedure
called
writ
of
error
coram
nobis
that
is
exclusively
available
for
petitioners
who
have
already
completed
service
of
their
sentence.
so
it's
not
unheard
of
at
all.
now,
and
in
fact,
i
believe
this
court
heard
last
in,
last
month
a
case
called
mullain
where
the
court
is
considering
expanding
the
scope
of
federal,
uh,
of
2254a
to
include
petitioners
who
have
already
completed
service
of
their
sentences.
so,
you
know,
the,
the
fact
that
the,
that
the,
uh,
vacation
occurred
after
the
commutation
i
don't
believe
is
particularly
significant
and
should
not
be
particularly
significant.
we
shouldn't
say
that
on
janu...,
on
june
15
of
'81
the
defendant
was,
could,
could
get
2726
relief
and
that
on
june
17,
the
day
after
the
commutation,
that
he
couldn't.
that
doesn't
make
real
good
sense.
that's
drawing
a
line
based
really
on
a
technicality,
uh,
because
the
defendant
was
entitled
to
relief
from
the
state
court
and
that's
what
he
got.
now,
the,
the,
the
technical
nature
of
this
situation,
the
technical
reliance
upon
the,
the
technical
aspect
of
relying
upon
bradley
and
upon
lange,
best
is
really
described
well
by
the
dissent
from
the
en
banc
opinion
of
the
8th
circuit.
in,
when
you
follow
those
cases
blindly,
you're
destroying
the
intent
of
the
missouri
legislature
for
this
crime
of
attempted
robbery
with
a
murder
along
with
it.
the,
the
missouri
legislature
intends
that
there
be
life
imprisonment.
you
are
also
destroying
the
intent
of
the
sentencing
judge.
the
sentencing
judge
was
showing
society's
outrage
at
the
heinous
nature
of
the
respondent's
crimes
when
he
sentenced
the
respondent
to
15
years
and
life
imprisonment,
the
maximum
terms,
and
then
ordered
them
to
run
consecutively.
now,
if
the,
if
the
sentencing
judge
had
not,
had
done
the
opposite,
if
he
had
set
the
life
term
first,
we
would
not
be
before
this
court.
there
would
not
be
any
problem.
if
the
sentencing
judge
had
been
nice
to
the
defendant,
if
he
had
ordered
that
the
terms
run
concurrently,
again,
we
would
not
be
before
this
court.
the,
as
the
opinion
below
notes,
that's
due
to
just
the
whim
of
the
15
year
term
running
first
is
because,
is
because
it
was
the
first
count
in
the
charging
document.
just
happen
chance.
happen,
happen,
happenstance
that
it
occurred
that
way.
so,
really
when
you
are
looking
at
this
case,
the,
the
situation
is
really
not
like
lange
and
bradley
as
long
as
you
interpret
lange
and
bradley
as
only
being
consistent
with
this
court's
jurisprudence
in
multiple
punishment
areas.
this
defendant
today
has
one
conviction.
this
defendant
has
one
sentence.
this
defendant
has
only
served
time
since
1973
for
the
completion
of
that
felony
murder
sentence.
there
is
no
multiple
punishment.
there
is
no
multi--
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
stephen
d.
hawke
mr.
chief
justice,
and
say
it
please
the
court:
one
of
the
last
comments
that
were
made
by
the
respondent
was,
sometimes
the
federal
constitution
requires
courts
to
do
things
that
the
courts
don't
like.
if
that's
the
situation,
then
perhaps
there
is
a
fundamental
flaw
in
what
the
court
is
thinking.
the
example
here
is
with
multiple
punishments.
the
multiple
punishment
concept
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
only
prohibits
multiple
punishment
that
it,
or
not,
or
only
prohibits
punishment
that
is
not
authorized
by
the
legislature.
the,
the,
the
application
of
bradley
to
this
situation
is
what
creates
the
problem.
it's
what
created
the
result
of
the,
of
the
five
judges
from
the
eighth
circuit.
when
you
look
at
bradley,
and
when
you
look
at
it
and,
and
think
that
the
rule
announced
in
bradley,
that
completion
of
service
of
alternative
sentences
precludes
the
power
of
the
court
to
punish
further,
that
language,
the
holding
in
bradley,
which
is
dicta
from
lange,
had
no
support
before
bradley,
and
has
not
been
followed
by
this
court
since
bradley.
mr.
stephen
d.
hawke
the,
the
situation
that
you
are
describing
refers
to
the
expectancy
of
the
defendant
and
a
finality
of
the
sentencing
process.
mr.
stephen
d.
hawke
the,
the
court
discussed
this
in
difrancesco,
and
in
the
situation
here,
you
either
have,
you
have
a
defendant's
subjective
expectation
at
the
time
of
sentencing
that
he's
going
to
serve
15
years
followed
by
a
life
sentence.
that
was
his
subjective
expectation
when
the
sentencing
judge
announced
his
intent
in
sentencing,
or
announced
his
sentence.
do
you
want
to
look
at
some
objective
in
expectation
of
the
defendant?
the
defendant's
objective
expectation
at
the
time
of
sentencing
was
that
he
would
either
serve
15
years
for
the
attempted
robbery
conviction
or
that
he
would
serve
a
life
term
for
the
murder
connected
with
the
attempted
robbery.
now,
if
you
look
at
that
objective
expectation
that
the
defendant
may
have,
that's
what's
been
fulfilled
here.
the
defendant
is
under
one
conviction
for
one
sentence,
life
imprisonment.
so,
any
expecta...
ex,
uh,
expectancy
interest
by
the
defendant
is
not,
is
not
really
at
issue
in
this
particular
case,
be
it
either
at
a
subjective
level
or
at--
mr.
stephen
d.
hawke
--the
discussion,
i
think
in
difrancesco
and
in
whalen
and
in
hunter
focus
primarily
upon
the
intent
of
the
legislature
in
the
punishment
process.
there
may
be
some
type
of
expectancy
interest
related
to
the
finality
of
punishment,
uh,
that
you
just
can't
bring
in--
mr.
stephen
d.
hawke
--uh,
that
is
uncertain.
you
can
certainly
draw,
uh,
draw
that
inference
from
the
difrancesco
case.
mr.
stephen
d.
hawke
that's
a
hard
case,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
d.
hawke
and
in
response
to
that,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
court
should,
should
examine
the,
uh,
the
case
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause
in
a
technical
manner.
the
court
should
look
at
the
purposes
behind
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
uh,
in
this
case
be
it
examining
the,
uh,
making
sure
the
punishment
is
not
exceeding
the,
uh,
the
legislature's
intent,
and
perhaps
some
expectancy
interest.
i
don't
think
you
have
to
get
into
any
type
of
expectancy
interest
in
this
case,
because
other
under
either
a
subjective
or
objective,
uh,
interest
in
the
defendant,
would
not,
is
not
implicated
here.
the
process
of
sentencing
is
not
a,
is,
it
it
is
a
serious
subject.
it's
a,
it's
an
important
subject,
one
of
the
more
important
things,
perhaps
most
important
thing,
that
a
trial
judge,
be
it
at
the
state
court
level
or
at
the
federal
court
level,
has
to
do.
and
as
this
court
noted
in
bozza,
that
sentencing
should
not
be
transferred
into,
into
a
game.
it
should
not
be
a
situation
where,
uh,
where
a
technical
rule
violates
the
legislative
intent
or
the
senator's
intent.
the
situation
you
have
in
this
case,
if
you
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
eighth
circuit
is
that
you
have
transformed
the
sentencing
process
into
a
game.
in
particular,
a
game
where
the
judge
didn't
have
the
rules,
the
sentencing
judge
didn't
have
the
rules
of
the
game
until
eight
years
later.
it's
like
playing
monopoly
without
having
the
rules
that
milton
bradley
gives
you.
it's
just
not,
it's
just
not
the
way
that
it
should
be.
for
the
reasons
stated,
the
petitioner
respectfully
requests
that
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
8th
circuit
be
reversed.
