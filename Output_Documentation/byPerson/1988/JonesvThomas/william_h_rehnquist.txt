chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
on
number
88-420,
jimmy
jones
v.
larry
p.
thomas.
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
may,
may
not
bradley
have
rested
partly
on
the,
on
the
statutory
idea,
too.
that
was
totally
within
the
federal
courts.
that
is
correct.
and
that's
something
that,
that
has
struck
me
about
both
lange
and
bradley
is
that
it's
a
federal
court
supervising
a
federal
sentence.
in
here
you
have
a
situation
where
the
state
court,
uh,
heard
a
claim
of
multiple
punishment.
the
state
court,
the
2726
court
examined
the
amended
motion
for
2726
relief
and
vacated
the
attempted
robbery
conviction
and
sentence,
with
that
time
being
credited
towards
completion
of,
of,
of
the
murder
sentence.
when
you
look
at
the
habeas
statute,
the
habeas
statute
says,
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
is
in
custody
in
violation
of
the
constitutional
laws
or
treaties
of
the
united
states.
but
may
i
just
ask,
at
the
time
they
vacated
the,
that,
that
sentence,
had
not
the
governor
already
commuted
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
hawke.
mr.
baldwin?
chief
justice
rehnquist
there's
a
certain
ludicrousness
about
what
happened
here,
mr.
baldwin.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i'm
asking
you
a
question.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
said,
there's
a
certain
ludicrousness
about
what
happened
here,
because
the
man
was
convicted
of
attempted
robbery.
he
was
convicted
of
murder.
he
ends
up
serving
a
sentence
for
attempted
robbery,
seven
or
eight
years,
and
the
8th
circuit
says
he's
free
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
now,
that
wouldn't
make
any
sense
to
an
awful
lot
of
people
if
you
just
explained
it
to
them.
chief
justice
rehnquist
follow
up
the
law--
--we'll
resume
there
at
1:00,
mr.
baldwin.
0
[recess.]
mr.
baldwin,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
much
of
that
is
double
jeopardy,
law,
uh,
mr.
baldwin,
and
how
much
is
just
ordinary
state
criminal
law
or
sentencing
law?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
baldwin.
mr.
hawke,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hawke.
the
case
is
submitted.
