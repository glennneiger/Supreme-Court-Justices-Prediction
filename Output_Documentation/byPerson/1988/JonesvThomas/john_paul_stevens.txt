justice
stevens
mr.
hawke,
may
i,
may
i...
supposing
he
had
served
the
full
15
years
on
the
armed
robbery
conviction
and
was
one
year
into
the
life
sentence
in
the
time.
the
governor
then
commuted
the
life
sentence
on
the
ground
that,
the
very
ground
he
did
here.
could
then
the
judge
have
resentenced
him
on
the
already
served
15
year
sentence,
i'm
going
to
change
that
to
life
because
you
expected
to
serve
life
anyway?
justice
stevens
well,
but,
see
here,
isn't
that
what
it,
what
happened
here?
did
he
set
aside
the,
he
set
aside
the,
uh,
murder
conviction
or
the
robbery
conviction?
justice
stevens
well,
but
lange
stands
for
more
than
that.
because
it
also
says
you
can't
even
sentence
him,
make
him
serve
a
sentence
that
legislature
did
authorize
if
he
has
already
paid
the
fine
or
served
the
other
branch
of
it.
justice
stevens
well,
that's
the
holding.
justice
stevens
well,
what
did
the
case
hold,
do
you
think?
justice
stevens
and
the
reason
it
was
greater
is
because
there
were
two
sentences,
only
one
of
which
would
have
been
authorized.
justice
stevens
wasn't
that
exactly
what
was
true
here?
justice
stevens
there
are
two
sentences,
only
one
of
which
would
have
been
authorized,
because
it's
only
one
offense.
justice
stevens
why
can't
you
say
the
same
thing
about
lange?
justice
stevens
right.
either
one
of
which
would
have
been
permissible.
justice
stevens
why
is
that
different
from
serving
15
years
when
you
are
sentenced
to
both
15
years
and
life
on
just
one
offense?
justice
stevens
well,
that
would
be
like
saying
we'll
give
you
the
$10
fine
back.
that,
it,
would
they
have
saved
it
in
ex
parte
lange
if
they
had
offered
to
return
the
fine?
justice
stevens
so
they
vacated
a
sentence
that
had
fully
been
served
at
that
time.
justice
stevens
i
agree.
it's
exactly
like
the
ex
parte
lange.
it
is
not
unprecedented.
justice
stevens
so,
it's
in
other
words,
you
do
concede
that
we
have
to
do
more
than
just
look
at
what
the
maximum
sentence
the
legislature
authorizes?
