mr.
jason
berger
now,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
with
some
of
the
essentials,
which
i
think
have
been
related
to
by
the
commonwealth
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
with
regard
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
there's
no
question
but
that
the
facts
in
this
case
are
relatively...
i
shouldn't
say
relatively...
very
meager.
but
one
important
fact,
that
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
focused
on,
can
be
found
at
page
289
and
290
of
its
decision,
and
that
fact,
and
i'll
read
it.
it
says,
"lastly,
the
parties
agree
and
appeal,
that
pursuant
to
bank
policy,
employees
who
accrue
unused
vacation
time,
receive
a
lump
sum
cash
payment,
in
lieu
of
unused
vacation
time,
unused
time,
upon
termination
of
their
employment.
"
we
submit,
your
honors,
that
the
sj...
the
supreme
judicial
court
was
focusing
on
that
specific
issue
in
reaching
its
decision
that
this
plan
was
like
a
severance
plan,
akin
to
a
severance
plan
and,
therefore,
an
erisa
welfare
benefit
plan.
mr.
jason
berger
the
secretary
of
labor
says...
well,
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor,
that
the
secretary
of
labor
says--
mr.
jason
berger
--well,
i'm
not
sure
though,
that
the
secretary
of
labor
says
this
is
not
a
plan
at
all.
the
secretary
of
labor...
let
me
state
it
somewhat
differently.
petitioners,
including
the
solicitor,
have
focused
on
a
general
assets
test,
to
determine
whether
vacation
plan
is
a
general
assets,
everyday
payroll
practice,
or
whether,
in
fact,
it's
an
employee
welfare
benefit
plan.
but,
the
secretary
of
labor,
itself,
in
one
of
its
own
opinion
letters,
involving
american
motors,
has
found
a
general
assets
plan
to
be
a...
a
general
assets
vacation-pay
plan,
to
be
a
severance
plan.
now,
in
that
case,
which
is
cited
in
the
solicitor's
brief,
and
i
think
it's
given
reference
to
in
petitioner's
brief,
the
exercise...
it
was
a
voluntary
plan,
just
as
this
one.
the
employees
of
american
motors
had
a
right,
voluntarily,
to
set
aside
time,
if
they
wished,
their
vacation
time,
if
they
wished,
for
payment
upon
termination.
now,
the
secretary
focuses
in
its
brief
on
the
irrevocability
of
that
exercise,
and
yet,
even
in
that
plan,
the
exercise
by
the
employee
wasn't
irrevocable.
it
was
also
revocable.
mr.
jason
berger
the
secretary,
in
this
case,
argues
that
it
doesn't
agree
with
the
supreme
judicial
court.
that's
correct.
mr.
jason
berger
my
difficulty
with
that...
if
that's,
indeed,
what
the
secretary
is
saying.
my
difficulty
with
that
is
that
i
think
that
creates
a
very
difficult
tension
with
the
statute
itself.
i
mean,
the
statute
itself,
in
sections
3(1)(a)
and
3(1)(b),
lists
a
variety
of
benefits,
if
you
will,
benefits
that
are
subject
to
plans
that
shall
come
under
the
definition
of
employee
welfare
benefit
plan.
and,
in
3(1)(a),
it
squarely
mentions
vacation
benefits.
and,
in
3(1)(b),
it
squarely
mentions--
mr.
jason
berger
--but,
but
this--
mr.
jason
berger
--but
the
secretary
didn't
have
before
it
the
aspects
of
a
plan.
i
think
what
the
secretary
is
saying,
if
i'm
correct
in
my
reading,
is
that
it
would
like
to
see
most
general
asset
programs,
viewed
as
non-plans.
i,
i
don't
believe
the
secretary
is
saying
that
no
vacation
benefit
program,
such
as
this
one,
can
be
a
plan.
mr.
jason
berger
i
agree
that
the
secretary
argues
through
the
solicitor
that
this
particular
approach
is
not
a
plan.
to
that
extent,
we
agree...
disagree
with
the
secretary.
however,
we
don't
disagree
that
the
payroll
practice
regulation
is
invalid.
what
we
see...
what
we
say
is,
that
the
regulation
promulgated
by
the
secretary
has
more
than
one...
more
than
one
test
within
it.
i'm
not
sure
the
word
"test"
is
the
correct...
is
the
correct
word.
but,
a
close
reading
of
the...
of
that...
of
that
regulation,
which
is
the
second
regulation
focused
by
the
commonwealth,
sets
a
number
of
different
employments--
mr.
jason
berger
--but,
in
that
sense,
i
disagree.
in
that
sense,
i
disagree
with
the
secretary.
i
think,
if,
if
the
secretary
is,
in
fact,
saying
that,
and
again,
i'm
not
sure
the
secretary's
saying
that,
through
the
solicitor's
brief.
i
think
the
solicitor's
brief
is
essentially
arguing
that
most,
if
not
all,
general
asset
plans
do
not
come
within
the
definition
of
employee
welfare
benefit
plan.
and,
i'm
suggesting
that
that's,
first
of
all,
contrary
to
what
the
secretary
itself
has
found
in
another
plan...
american
motors.
and
two,
if
that
is
really
the
secretary's
opinion...
that
that
opinion
of,
of
its
own
regulation,
creates
a
serious
tension
with
the
statute.
and...
and
a...
a
better
way
of
reading
its
own...
its
own
regulation,
which
it
wrote...
you
have
to
take
into
consideration
all
the
words
of
that
regulation,
not
simply
the
word
"general
assets".
and
the
other
words
of
the
regulation
involve
an
employee
who's
absent
while
on
vacation,
or
on
holiday.
they
used
those
two
examples.
and
these
two
employees,
just
as
the
employees
in
american
motors,
were
no
longer
on
vacation,
and
they
were
no
longer
on
holiday.
they
were
no
longer
employees,
and
they
no
longer
had
any
duty
to
this
employer
for
that...
and
for
that
matter,
the
employer,
i
suppose,
had
no
duties
to
it,
since
it
had
terminated
the
employees
in
question.
mr.
jason
berger
well--
mr.
jason
berger
--i
actually
feel
that
the
first
part
of
the
regulation,
which
is,
(b)(1),
where
it
lists
those
four
criteria,
should
be
read
specifically
to
those
four
type
of
criteria,
because
those
four
criteria
essentially
arise
immediately.
an
employee
works
overtime,
he's
paid
for
his
in
excess
of
40
hours
in
a
week,
that
week.
an
employee
works
a
shift,
he
gets,
or
she
gets
her
35
cents
an
hour
shift
differentials.
mr.
jason
berger
no,
but
the
examples
given,
are
all
immediate-payment
examples.
with
regard
to
the
premium
suggested
in
(b)(3)(1),
that
the
premium
suggested
there,
is
a
premium
to
induce
the
employees
to
take
vacations
at
a
time
favorable
to
the
employer
for
business
reasons.
and,
i
submit
that
that
premium
is
a
very
different
kind
of
a
premium.
in
other
words,
if
i'm
coming
up
to
the
end
of
my
vacation
year--
mr.
jason
berger
--the
other
five...
there
are
four
other
examples,
which
are
not
provided
by
anyone,
it
appears.
but,
the
other
four
examples
are
all
for
periods
of
absence.
i
think
they're
jury
duty,
training
time,
military
duty,
and
sabbatical
leaves
for
educators.
so,
with
all
five
examples,
the
solicitor...
sorry...
the
secretary's
focusing
on
absent
time,
but
time,
during
which
the
employee's
expected
to
return
to
work.
all
five
of
those
examples
are,
at
best,
hiatuses
in
work
time.
mr.
jason
berger
are
not
plans?
mr.
jason
berger
we
would
agree
that
any
vacation
time
taken
within
a
year,
and
paid
for
within
that
year,
or
any
vacation
time
taken
and
paid
for,
is
not
a
plan.
in
other
words,
if,
if
it's
the
normal
everyday
vacation
time,
that
i
think
we
all
understand
as
normal
everyday
vacation
time.
i
take
two
weeks
off.
i'm
paid
for
that
two
weeks.
that's
not
a
plan.
in
fact,
if
i
saved
my
two
weeks...
if
i
save
my
two
weeks
until
next
year,
and
took
my
two
weeks
next
year...
say,
my
employer
allowed
me
to
do
that...
that
would
still
be...
i'm
still
within...
i'm
taking
vacation
time.
i'm
just
being
paid
for
it.
it's
just
a
continuation
of
wages.
mr.
jason
berger
i
think--
mr.
jason
berger
--i
think
when
a
cash
payout
becomes
involved,
there
begins
to
become
an
implication
toward
a
plan.
but
our
opinion,
and
we
submit
to
you
the
correct
opinion
on
this
issue,
is
that
a
deferral
is
necessary.
in
other
words,
once
an
employee
begins,
in
a
voluntary
way,
to
defer
vacation
time
for
some
later
cash
out
purpose
and,
therefore,
gets
no
money
and
pays
no
taxes
in
the
year
in
which
the
money
is
earned,
and
can
defer
that,
that
payment
until
some
later
time,
and
the
employee
is
then...
the
employer,
i'm
sorry...
is
entrusted
with
that
fund,
with
that
money.
it
begins...
it
begins
to
become
more
like
a
plan.
that's
correct.
mr.
jason
berger
i
think
that's
why
the...
i
think
that's
the
distinction,
exactly.
mr.
jason
berger
that's
exactly
the
distinction
i'm
drawing,
too.
the
distinction
i'm
attempting
to
draw--
mr.
jason
berger
--well,
let
me--
mr.
jason
berger
--well,
let
me
try
to
explain
it
somewhat
differently,
then.
first
of
all,
let
me
try
to
bring...
for
one
moment
at
least...
the
court
back
to
the
case
at
issue.
the
case
at
issue
involves
payment
upon...
after...
termination,
and
only
payment
after
termination.
mr.
jason
berger
he
accrued
that
time.
i
agree.
i
guess
i'm
not
yet
sure
about
the
question
that
you've
presented.
mr.
jason
berger
no,
because
the
regulation
reads...
the
way
i
read
the
regulation
is
for
periods
of
time
not
worked
where
pay
continues.
mr.
jason
berger
first
of
all,
i
think
that
if
the
secretary
had
intended
to
cover
a
vacation
premium,
within
(b)(1),
he
would
have
written
it
within
(b)(1),
just
as
he
did
within
(b)(3).
in
(b)(3),
the
secretary
seems
to
cover
the
type
of
vacation
premium
he's
concerned,
or
she's
concerned
with.
i
guess
it
was
he
at
the
time.
with
regard
to
(b)(1)--
mr.
jason
berger
--no,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
just
like
the
vacation.
i
don't
think
it
would
be
like
the
vacation
situation
we're
faced
with
in
this
case,
where...
where
employees
were
allowed
to
defer
their
vacation,
with
pay
upon
termination.
and,
i
don't
think
that...
i
don't
think--
mr.
jason
berger
--in
fact,
the
bank
paid
the
two
employees
for
time
accrued
within
that
year.
mr.
jason
berger
they
did.
they
paid
them.
i
think
the
year
was
1985,
and
they
paid
him
for
the
period,
january
of
'85
to
the
termination
date,
april
'85.
mr.
jason
berger
but,
in
fact--
mr.
jason
berger
--but,
but,
in
fact,
the
payment
out
of
these
vacation
trust
funds--
mr.
jason
berger
--i
can
only
think
of
one
case,
and
not
a
case
by
this
court.
but,
i
can
think
of
one
case,
in
which
payment
out
of
a
vacation
trust
fund
was
discussed,
and
in
that
case...
i
did
write
it
down
some
place...
ashton
v.
cory,
which
is
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
9th
circuit.
i
believe
a
decision
of
justice
kennedy.
mr.
jason
berger
well,
but,
it
wouldn't
read
on
that
case,
but
the
same
issues
are
involved.
mr.
jason
berger
well,
in
that
case,
the
employer
made
the
entire
payment
to
the
fund,
and
the
fund
distributed
the
payment
in
a
year
period.
that's
correct.
but,
the
same
exact
payments
were
made.
the
same
exact
type
payments
were
made.
and,
to
that
extent--
mr.
jason
berger
--but,
a
distinction
again,
that
i
think
creates
a
great
tension
with
the
statute.
i
mean,
the
statute
doesn't
make
that...
doesn't
seem
to
allow
that
kind
of
distinction.
and,
and
frankly,
as
i
read
the
regulation
of
the
department
of
labor,
i
don't
think
the
department
of
labor...
again,
is,
is,
focusing
solely
on
the
general
assets
test,
if
they
had
been.
if
it
had
been...
it
would
not
have
written
that
opinion
later
on
american
motors,
in
which
it
says
that
a
general
assets
plan
can
be
an
erisa
benefit
plan
dealing
with
vacation
pay.
mr.
jason
berger
from,
from
my
review
of
the
solicitor's
brief,
which
is
all
i
have
on
that
position...
the
solicitor
seems
to
point
to
the
word
"irrevocable"
to
be
the
distinction
between
that
situation
and
this
situation.
mr.
jason
berger
that's
the
way
i
read
it.
mr.
jason
berger
i
can't
take
that
position.
mr.
jason
berger
i
cannot
take
that
position,
because
i'm
not...
i
don't
see
the
evidence
of
that
within
the
record.
on
the
other
hand,
the
only
fact
pattern,
before
the
court,
involved
two
employees
who,
upon
termination,
were
compensated
for
their
unused
vacation
time.
and,
that
was
a
stipulation
that
we
arrived
at
to
present
the
issue
before
the
court,
that
it
would
require
termination
before
such
payment.
and,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
at
all,
which
speaks
to
the
other
issue.
but,
but...
to
get
back,
i
think
to
justice
stevens'
question
about
the
deferral
nature,
and
perhaps
i...
there
is
something
to
argue,
i
think,
that
any
deferred...
anytime
that
vacation
time
is
deferred
to
a
later
period
of
time,
and
not
paid
for,
until...
except
in...
except
in
a
lump-sum
distribution...
that
that
speaks
to
an
employee
welfare
benefit
plan.
and,
i
think
that
the
secretary's
own
regulation
supports
that,
because
the
secretary's
regulation
in
(b)(3)(1)
talks
about
the
type
of
premium
that
it
considers
to
be...
in
the
vacation
context...
that
it
considers
to
be
a
payroll
practice.
in
there
it
says,
"a
payment
to
induce
employees
to
take
vacations
at
a
time
favorable
to
the
employer
for
business
reasons.
"
i
think
one
can
argue
from
that,
that
the
secretary
envisioned
a
situation
where
there
was
a
deferral
of
vacation
time
for
lump-sum
payment
that
wasn't
required
or
induced
by
the
employer.
and
then,
at
that
later
time,
with
cash
out...
focusing
mostly
on
cash
out...
that
this
would
speak
to
more
of
the
plan
issue.
there's
one
other
thing
about
the
irrevocable
nature
of
the
plan
at
american
motors,
and
that
is,
that
that
wasn't
totally
irrevocable.
if
i
remember
the
facts
of
that
situation,
an
employee
could
apply
for
monies,
based
on
hardship,
very
similar
to
a
401(k)
arrangement,
and
"hardship"
is
a
word
that's
subject
to
a
great
deal
of
difference
of
opinion.
but
there
could...
there
were
ways
employees
could
draw
from
their
account,
if
you
will,
during
the
term
of
their
employment.
and
that,
the
solicitor
and
the
department
of
labor
did
not
see,
as
taking
that
program
out
of
the
definition
of
an
employee
welfare
benefit
plan.
mr.
jason
berger
it's
in
the
solicitor's
brief.
mr.
jason
berger
in
fact,
it's
in
a
footnote
of
the
solicitor's
brief.
mr.
jason
berger
well,
we
just
happen
to
have
it
handy.
it's
in
footnote
12
on
page
19.
mr.
jason
berger
i'd
like
to
turn
to...
one
argument
the
commonwealth
makes
in
their
brief...
in
their
reply
brief...
not
here,
with
regard
to
vacation
being
equated
with
wages.
the
commonwealth
makes
reference
to
bankruptcy
preference...
the
bankruptcy
preference
code,
section
507.
and
in
its
reply
brief
states
that
vacations
there
are
treated
as
wages,
and
since
they're
treated
as
wages
there,
they
must,
or
should
be
treated
here
as
wages
as
well.
now,
the
commonwealth
has
conveniently
used
ellipses
in
quoting
that
statute,
because
the
word
next
to
507,
is
the
word
"severance",
and
it
says,
"that
for
the
purpose
of
507,
severance
payments
shall
be
equated
with
wages,
as
well.
"
now,
since
it's
acknowledged
by
this
court
that
severance
plans
are
already
seen
as
an
employee
welfare
benefit
plan,
section
507
gives
the
commonwealth
no
help,
whatsoever,
with
regard
to
the
argument
of
wages.
finally,
the
commonwealth
argues
that
there's
no
administration
necessary,
with
regard
to
this
plan,
and
attempts
to
argue,
i
think,
that
the
fort
halifax
case...
decision
of
this
court...
is
controlling.
but,
that,
as
the
supreme
judicial
court
found,
is
not
all
true.
a
plan
such
as
this
one,
which
is
again,
very
much
akin
to
a
severance
pay
plan,
requires
a
great
deal
of
administration
by
an
employer.
there's...
there's
the
need
to
keep
records,
with
regard
to
vacation
time
earned,
vacation
time
not
taken,
vacation
time
saved.
there
could
be
a
periodic--
mr.
jason
berger
--sure.
mr.
jason
berger
i
believe
that's
a
severance
plan.
mr.
jason
berger
i
think,
if--
mr.
jason
berger
--i
believe
it
is.
i
think
if
an
employer
has
a
consistent
approach
to
severance,
and
the
example
you're
giving
me,
is
a
consistent
approach,
that
that's
a
plan.
and,
that
if
every
employer--
mr.
jason
berger
--i
think
we'd
all
like
to
believe
that's
true.
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
jason
berger
--i'm
not
sure
the
watch
would
be
covered.
i
think
the
cash
would
be
covered.
mr.
jason
berger
i
think
so.
mr.
jason
berger
why
wouldn't
the
watch--
mr.
jason
berger
--no.
but,
to
the
extent
that
the
statute
was
very
concerned
with
employers'
not
keeping
their
promises,
and
the
statute
was
also
concerned
with
tax
treatment.
you
know,
that
certain
types
of
benefits...
most
benefits,
for
that
matter,
if
not
all
benefits
under
erisa,
aren't
taxed
in
one
way
or
another,
are
subject
to
a
favorable
tax
treatment.
in
that
sense,
i
suppose,
a
watch
could
be
taxed,
if
it's
construed
to
be
wages
and
not
a
gift.
but,
i
think
it
was
mostly
concerned
with
promises
not
kept,
in
the
area
of
money...
actual
compensation.
i
suppose
it
would
depend
on
the
cost
of
the
watch.
back
to
the
administration
issue.
the
plan
that
is
at
issue
in
this
case
creates
a
periodic
demand
upon
the
employer.
if
you
will
accept,
as
we
believe,
that
this
plan
paid
only
upon
termination,
and
those
are
the
only
facts
before
the
supreme
judicial
court,
at
least
then,
with
every
termination,
there
was
a
possibility
that
the
employer
would
have
to
make
some
determination,
after
eligibility,
to
make
a
payoff.
so,
i
think
there's
clearly
enough
administration
here,
to
bring
the
program
squarely
within
erisa.
today,
the
commonwealth
does
not
make
an,
an
argument
before
this
court,
with
regard
to
the
question
of
erisa
welfare
benefit
plan.
now,
if
the
plan
is
an
erisa
welfare
benefit
plan,
as
we
say
it
is,
i
can't
see
any
argument,
whatsoever,
that
the
commonwealth
statute
doesn't
relate
to
the
plan.
now,
the
commonwealth
statute
is
a
clear
effort
to
enforce
the
plan.
it
attempts
to
enforce
it
by
a
criminal
action,
and
in
my
experience,
many
employers
are
more
concerned
about
a
criminal
finding
than
they
are
about
paying.
no
one
wants
to
be
found
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor.
so,
clearly,
the
commonwealth
is
attempting
to
enforce
a
welfare
benefit
plan,
with
regard
to
its
section
149...
148,
149.
and
they've
just
as
much,
admitted
that
here,
today,
i
think.
secondly,
in
its
brief,
again,
it
says
that
there's
no
restitution
available,
which
is
not
true.
there's
restitution
available
through
the
massachusetts
criminal
court
system,
as
there
is
for
many
criminal
court
systems,
if
not
all.
and,
and
there's
a
case
that
i
brought
with
me
today,
or
to
cite,
because
we
did
not
have
chance
to
file
a
reply
to
their
reply,
which
is
commonwealth
v.
nawn.
that's
a
394
massachusetts
decision,
page
one,
which
talks
about
a
criminal...
the
right
of
a
criminal
court
to
grant
restitution.
so,
clearly,
an
individual
who
was
pursuing
this
statute,
would
have
a
right
to
restitution,
as
well
as
a
right
to
enforce
the
plan.
enough,
i
think,
is
said
about
"relates
to".
and,
that
leaves
a
question
of
general
applicability,
whether
this
is
a
generally
applicable
criminal
law.
there's
really
very
little
i
can
add
to
the
questions
already
raised
by
the
court
about
that,
that
phrase...
that
term.
first
of
all,
to
the
extent
again,
as
we
submit,
that
the
plan
before
us
is,
in
fact,
an
erisa
welfare
benefit
plan...
this
statute
squarely
deals
with
employee
welfare
benefit
plans.
it
might
say
wages,
which
are
vacation
benefits.
but,
to
the
extent
that
it
deals
with
vacation
benefits,
is
absolutely
and
squarely
directed
at
a
welfare
benefit
plan.
i
don't
see
any
way
around
that
argument.
now,
to
the
extent
that
it
also
deals
with
wages...
there's
nothing
to
say
that
the
statute
isn't
valid
as
a
whole.
and,
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
did
not
find
it
to
be
invalid
as
a
whole.
they
found
it
invalid
only
to
the
extent
that
it
reached
employee
welfare
benefit
plans,
which
were,
in
fact,
welfare
benefit
plans
under
erisa.
so,
from
that
point
of
view,
i
think
the
statute
is
directed
right
at...
right
at
an
erisa
cover
topic,
and,
therefore,
invalid
to
that
extent.
to
the
extent
that
it
is...
to
the
extent
that
the
commonwealth
values
that
are
generally
applicable
in
any
sense...
again,
under
that
analysis,
anything
would
be
generally
applicable,
because
it
applies
to
everyone
within
a
specific
group
or
classification.
a
state...
a
state
could
draw
a
15-person
statute,
and
i'm
not
saying
an
inappropriate
one,
and
say,
this
would
be
criminal
if
any
one
of
these
15
people
commit
this
crime,
and
it
would
apply,
generally,
to
all
those
individuals.
but,
that
certainly
does
not
make
the
statute
generally
applicable.
additionally,
erisa
really
chose...
the
congress,
when
it
promulgated
erisa,
really
chose
a
very
comprehensive
scheme
for
enforcement.
and,
it
shows
for
participants
and
beneficiaries,
a
civil
remedy.
it
did
not
choose
for
them
a
criminal
remedy.
so,
again,
it
shows
its
disfavor
with
regard
to
criminal
remedies
in
that
same
area.
the
definition
of
"generally
applicable"
that
the
supreme
judicial
court
found,
which
i
think
is
the
definition
held
by
most
people,
is
a
statute
which
applies
to
the
public,
in
general.
and,
by
creating
such
a
statute,
what
the
congress,
i
think,
was
intending
to
do,
was
to
say,
if
you
steal
from
a
plan...
if
you're
an
individual,
and
you
steal
from
a
plan...
don't
look
to
erisa
to
protect
you
against
prosecution
for
stealing.
anybody
who
steals
can
be
prosecuted,
and
stealing
from
a
plan
does
not
protect
it.
but,
congress
certainly
did
not
want
the
states
to
be
able
to
promulgate
specific
laws
and
hide
them,
with...
within
general
language,
that
would
apply
to
erisa.
and
finally,
i
disagree
strongly
with
the
commonwealth
argument
that
this
exception
should
be
read
broadly.
it
should
be
read
narrowly,
such
as
any
exception
to
the
statute.
but
i
do
agree
that
the
exception
is
subject
to
a
conflict
analysis.
in
other
words,
if
it
is
a
generally
applicable
law,
it
still
must
pass
the
test
as
to
whether
it
is
in
conflict
with
erisa
as
a
whole.
and
here,
it
clearly
is.
first
of
all,
as
i
said
before,
erisa
set
up
a
civil
enforcement
requirement.
the
courts
discussed
that
in
a
number
of
recent
cases.
this
is
criminal...
certainly,
something
not
chosen,
and
clearly
not
chosen
on
purpose
by
congress.
therefore,
it's
in
conflict
in
that
it
is
criminal.
it's
in
conflict
in
terms
of
the
payment
procedures.
under
erisa,
you
have
approximately
90
days
to
pay
a
benefit.
under
the
mass
statute,
it's
immediately
upon
discharge,
that
day,
and
approximately
six
days
later...
the
payroll
period
later.
so
there's
a
second
conflict.
and,
the
third
conflict,
and
a
very
extreme
conflict,
at
that,
is
that
this
statute
is
directed
at
any
officer
of
the
corporation.
it
need
not
be
an
individual
who
had
any
involvement,
whatsoever,
with
the
erisa
plan.
the
statute
doesn't
require
any
involvement
at
all,
just
the
names
and
number
of
officers,
including
the
president.
and
then,
these
individuals
have
personal
liability
for
that
plan...
for
the
payment
of
that
plan,
both
personal
and
criminal.
erisa
certainly
did
not
choose
personal
liability
for
people
not
related,
in
any
fashion,
to
the
plan
at
issue.
and,
it
certainly
didn't
choose
criminal
responsibility
for
those
individuals,
except
under
specific
problems,
such
as
disclosure.
so,
again,
that's
the
third
conflict.
in
closing,
let
me
again,
go
back
to
the
primary
question
i
think
i've
been
asked
by
this
court,
with
the
few
minutes
i
have
remaining.
mr.
jason
berger
that's
all
it
will
take,
i
think.
and,
that
is
that,
"vacation
benefits"
are
a
word
used
squarely
within
the
statute.
no
question,
whatsoever,
about
that.
it's
used
twice.
it's
used
in
3(1)(a)
and
3(1)(b).
in
3(1)(b),
the
word
is
"pooled
vacation
benefits".
just
the
type
of
benefits
that
the
solicitor,
i
think,
suggests,
and
petitioner
certainly
suggests,
are
the
only
types
of
benefits
precluded...
included
within
erisa.
if
that
were
true,
3(1)(a),
as
it
applied
to
vacation
benefits,
would
be
superfluous.
there
would
be
no
reason
in
the
world
to
have
those
words.
thank
you.
