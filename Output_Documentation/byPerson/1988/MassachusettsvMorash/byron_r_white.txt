justice
white
why
don't
we...
the
government's
brief
says,
"that
the
department
of
labor
has
interpreted
its
payroll
practices
regulation
to
exclude
from
erisa's
coverage,
all
vacation
benefits
paid
from
the
general
assets,
including
earned,
but
unused
vacation
days.
"
justice
white
well,
i
know.
i
know.
well,
how
did
it...
what
part
of
its
regulation
was
it
interpreting
to
reach
that
result?
justice
white
what
part
of
it?
justice
white
well,
at
least
the
government
has
interpreted
its
own
regulation
to
cover
this
case,
and
i
suppose
we...
if,
if
that's
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
its
regulation,
i
suppose
we
would
accept
it.
justice
white
well,
the
government
filed
a...
the
government
has
filed
a
brief
in
another
case,
that
it
served
on
you,
didn't
it?
justice
white
what
did
it
say
in
that?
justice
white
the
secretary
of
labor
says
it
isn't
a
plan
at
all.
justice
white
well,
he
has
to
say
that.
it
isn't
a
plan,
or
whatever
those
words
are.
it
isn't
a
plan
or
an
arrangement,
or
something.
justice
white
okay,
the
secretary
in
this
case
says
this
is
not
a
plan
within
the
meaning
of
the...
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
justice
white
well,
it
says
it
isn't
a
plan,
and
its
regulation
says
that,
"the
term
welfare
plan
shall
not
include
the
following.
"
and
then
it
lists
certain
things
then,
and
among
those
things
that
the
secretary
says,
now,
is
this
very
arrangement
that
we
have
before
us,
which
is
not
a
plan.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
it
still
has
to
be
a
plan
to
provide
vacation
benefits.
justice
white
it
has
to
be
a
plan,
and
the
secretary
says
this
isn't
a
plan.
justice
white
well,
it
certainly...
it
certainly...
he
certainly
says...
the
secretary
certainly
says
that
this
plan,
that
this
arrangement
here,
is
not
a
plan.
this,
this
specific
arrangement
is
not
a
plan.
justice
white
yes,
why
the
secretary
interprets
that
regulation
to
cover
this
specific
arrangement.
