justice
o'connor
mr.
valvo,
is
the
regulation
in
a
bit
of
tension
with
the
language
of
the
statute?
justice
o'connor
section
3(1)
says,
"employee
welfare
benefit
plan
means
any
plan,
fund,
or
program
maintained
by
an
employer
to
provide
vacation
benefits.
"
justice
o'connor
is
that
a
severance
benefit
then?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
if
the
employer
would
allow
employees
to
make
an
irrevocable
deferral
of
vacation
benefits,
which
would
be
available
to
the
employee,
only
on
termination
of
the
employment,
or
in
an
emergency?
justice
o'connor
right.
justice
o'connor
would
that
be
a
severance
benefit
of
some
kind?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
type
of
statute
is
not
generally
applicable
criminal
law,
then,
in
your
view?
i'm
somewhat
troubled
by
your
argument.
justice
o'connor
it's
an
original
proposition.
i
certainly
would
have
thought
that
the
law
here
was
not
a
generally
applicable
criminal
law.
justice
o'connor
well,
if
we
agree
with
you
on
the
first
part
of
your
argument,
and
agree
with
the
government's
position,
we
certainly
don't
have
to
rest
it
on
this
argument,
i
assume?
justice
o'connor
but,
it
was,
nevertheless,
some
kind...
could
be
viewed
as
compensation
on
account
of
work
performed,
such
as
a
holiday
premium.
justice
o'connor
you
could
view
it
that
way,
certainly,
within
the
language
of
the
regulation?
justice
o'connor
well,
nothing
refers
in
the
regulation
to
immediate
payment
though,
does
it?
justice
o'connor
but,
that's
just
an
example.
justice
o'connor
how
do
you
understand
the
secretary's
position...
or
what
do
you
understand
the
secretary
of
labor's
position
to
be,
with
regard
to
an
irrevocable
deferral
of
vacation
benefits,
payable
only
on
termination?
justice
o'connor
and,
to
acknowledge
that
that
might
be
a
covered
erisa
plan?
justice
o'connor
now,
do
you
take
the
position
that
there
is
evidence
in
this
record
that
this
is
that
kind
of
plan?
justice
o'connor
you
cannot?
