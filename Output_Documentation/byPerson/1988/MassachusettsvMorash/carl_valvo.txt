mr.
carl
valvo
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court.
the
primary
issue
presented
is
whether
an
employer's
agreement
to
pay
additional
compensation
in
lieu
of
vacation
is
an
erisa
employee
welfare
benefit
plan,
as
the
court
below
held,
or
is
it
a
payroll
practice
outside
the
scope
of
erisa,
as
the
secretary
of
labor
concluded.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
as
follows:
the
employer
bank
had
agreed
that
employees
could
forego
some
or
all
of
an
annual
vacation
leave
and,
instead,
receive
payments
for
the
unused
vacation
time.
these
payments
came
from
the
general
assets
of
the
bank.
in
1985,
two
employees
of
the
bank
were
discharged,
each
with
an
accumulation
of
days
they
had
actually
worked
instead
of
taking
vacation.
upon
their
termination,
the
bank
refused
to
pay
for
this
time
worked,
and,
subsequently,
criminal
complaints
under
the
massachusetts
statute,
section
148,
were
filed.
upon
report
from
the
trial
court
to
the
sjc,
the
sjc
held
that
the
prosecutions
under
the
state
statute
were
preempted
by
erisa.
now,
if
the
bank's
arrangement
is
a
welfare
benefit
plan,
as
the
court
below
held,
then
employers
with
common
vacation
policies
like
the
bank's,
may
be
required
to
comply
with
erisa's
elaborate
regulatory
provisions,
with
no
real
corresponding
benefit
to
employees.
if,
however,
the
practice
is
a
payroll
practice,
as
the
secretary
of
labor
terms
it,
the
states
will
continue
to
enforce
statutes
like
section
148,
which
have
long
been
proven
to
be
an
efficient
and
effective
means
of
resolving
vacation
pay
claims,
which
often
amount
to
no
more
than
a
few
hundred
dollars.
if
the
sjc
is
correct,
then
a
disappointed
employee's
sole
remedy,
with
respect
to
vacation
pay,
will
be
to
file
a
federal
erisa
action
to
claim
his...
his
pay.
now,
whether
one
views
these
payments
as
straight
compensation
for
time
worked
or
as
a
lump
sum
amount
that
aggregates
what
would
have
been
paid
to
the
employee
had
he
taken
vacation,
the
secretary's
payroll
practices
regulation
controls.
this
regulation
was
promulgated
shortly
after
the
enactment
of
erisa,
pursuant
to
express
and
a
quite
broad
delegation
of
rule-making
power
to
the
secretary,
to
carry
out
the
provisions
of
the
statute
and
to
define
its
terms.
and,
i
might
add
that,
unlike
justice
scalia
perhaps,
the
secretary
had
to
both
read
the
statute
and
deal
with
reality.
he
had
to
make
the
plan
requirements
of
erisa
work
in
the
real
world,
so
that
this
payroll
practice
is
a...
the
regulation
is
an
accommodation
of
the
purposes
and
history
of
the
statute,
as
applied
to
common
payroll
practices
used
throughout
the
nation.
mr.
carl
valvo
no,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
valvo
right.
now,
the
secretary
was,
in
fact,
trying
to
give
some
scope
and
clarity
to
the
term,
"employee
welfare
benefit
plan",
that
would
include,
of
course,
such
an
enumerated
benefit.
he,
at
the
time,
read
that
statutory
provision
to
include
and
mean
the
pooled
vacation
arrangements
that
congress
was
aware
of,
through
the
provisions
in
the
taft-hartley
act.
mr.
carl
valvo
pardon
me?
mr.
carl
valvo
there
are
several
provisions
in
the
enumerated
benefits
in
taft-hartley
that
were
also
mentioned
in
erisa,
and
some
in
exactly
the
same
language,
some
in
slightly
different
language.
for
instance,
daycare
centers
versus
childcare
centers.
it's
difficult
to
assume
that
congress
meant
a
different...
had
a
different
meaning
for
some
of
these
terms,
just
because
it
used
it
again
in
3(1),
than
the
use
of
the
term
in
the
taft-hartley
act.
so,
i
think
that
it's
fair
to
conclude,
as
the
secretary
did,
that
congress
was
not
so
much
concerned
with
defining
neat
boxes
of
benefits
in
erisa
that
would
be
in
addition
to
whatever
was
in
the
taft-hartley
enumeration
of
benefits.
it
was
just
throwing
a
lot
of
things
into
the
scope
of
erisa,
and
one
of
those
things
was
the
funded
vacation
arrangements
that
congress
was
well
aware
of
in
the
longshore
and
construction
industries.
mr.
carl
valvo
i
have
two
answers
to
that,
your
honor.
one,
is
the
(b)(1)
portion
of
that
regulation,
which--
mr.
carl
valvo
--that
is
at
page
11
of
the
reply
brief.
mr.
carl
valvo
yes,
your
honor.
both
the
(b)(1)
portion
and
the
(b)(3)
portion
are
on
a
sheet
that
was
provided
to
the
court,
so
that
you
can
look
at
them
together.
the
(b)(1)
portion
of
that
regulation--
mr.
carl
valvo
--page
11
of
the
reply.
that
provision
provides
that
straight
compensation
for
time
worked
is
a
payroll
practice
and
not
a
benefit
under
erisa,
because
congress
simply
did
not
intend
to
cover
wages
and
salaries
within
the
scope
of
erisa.
now,
if
one
looks
at
these
payments
for
salaried
employee,
as
nothing
more
than
the
compensation
that
was
earned
at
a
previous
time
by
working
on,
in
effect,
the
employee's
own
time,
that
is,
uncompensated
time...
that
is
compensation
for
time
worked,
and
it
fits
squarely
within
the
(b)(1)
portion
of
the
regulation.
now,
if
you
look
at
the
(b)(3)
portion
of
the
regulation--
mr.
carl
valvo
--(b)(1)?
mr.
carl
valvo
well,
let
me
give
you
an
example.
a
salaried
employee
works
for
a
set
amount
for
a
given
year,
say
$20,000
for
a
year.
mr.
carl
valvo
if
he
gets
four
weeks
vacation...
what
the
employer
is
telling
him
is...
i
will
pay
you
$20,000,
and
you
work
48
weeks.
if
that
employee
works
the
49th
week,
he's
now
worked
an
extra
week
for
the
employer,
but
he
hasn't
been
paid
anymore
than
the
$20,000
that
he--
mr.
carl
valvo
--well,
he'll
get
regular
installments
of
52
or
12,
whatever
the
arrangement
is,
of
the
$20,000.
in
a
sense,
he's
not
getting
any
more
than
he
originally
agreed
to
get
in
return
for
48
weeks.
when
he
works
that
49th
week,
he
will
be
uncompensated,
unless
the
employer
has
an
agreement
like
the
bank
has
here,
to
allow
him
to
take
a
payment
instead
of
taking
vacation.
mr.
carl
valvo
well,
yes.
mr.
carl
valvo
you...
you're
right
in
the
sense
that
he
received
his
regular
paycheck,
but
that
regular
paycheck
was
nothing
more
than
an
installment
on
the
$20,000
that
he
was
getting
for
working
48
weeks.
an
employer
ordinarily
divides
the
$20,000
into
12
or
52
uniform
installments,
and
pays
them
out
regularly.
it
doesn't
stop
sending
out
the
paycheck,
if
you
happen
to
be
on
vacation
that
week.
but,
the
total
compensation
for
that
year
for
a
salaried
employee,
would
be
for
the
48
weeks,
rather
than
the...
anything
extra.
it's
very
similar
to
working
overtime,
or
on
weekends,
or
holidays.
those
are...
that's
time
that
the
employee
does
not
originally
bargain
to
work
for,
and
if
he
does
work
on
a
weekend,
he
expects
to
be
paid
over
and
above
the
$20,000.
but,
again,
you
can
look
at
it
a
different
way.
you
can
look
at
it
as
a
payment
to
the
employee,
while
he's
on
vacation.
and,
that
is
covered
by
the
(b)(3)
portion
of
the
regulation.
now,
the
reason
why
it
appears
that
it
may
not
cover
this
particular
situation
is
because
these
employees
were
terminated.
they
couldn't
go
on
vacation
anymore.
the
employer,
upon
termination,
had
two
options.
he
could
have
discharged
them,
effective
immediately,
and
paid
them
the
cash
value
of
the
unused
vacation
that
they
still
had.
or
he
could
have
said,
20
days'
vacation
coming...
"you're
fired,
effective
20
work
days
from
now,
and
i'll
pay
you
your
regular
paycheck
during
each
of
the
weeks
for
that
20
days.
"
that's
economically
equivalent
to
a
termination
with
a
lump-sum
cash
out
on
the
last
day
of
work.
mr.
carl
valvo
no,
your
honor,
it's
not
a
severance.
it's...
a
severance
payment
would
be
payable
only
at
termination.
whereas,
a
vacation
payment
is
payable
during
the
course
of
employment
up
to
termination.
mr.
carl
valvo
well,
then
you're
getting...
then
you're
talking
about
an
arrangement,
which
we
don't
have
here--
mr.
carl
valvo
--that
may
be
described
by
the
statutory
definition
of
pension.
now,
no
one
has
ever
argued
that
this
is
a--
mr.
carl
valvo
--well,
the
erisa
section
3(2)
talks
about
pension
benefits,
as
opposed
to
welfare
benefits.
the
secretary
has
treated
these
kinds
of
severance
payments
as
welfare
plans,
but
they
fit
within
the
definition
of
pension.
no
one
has
ever
suggested
that
these
are
pension
benefits,
because
they're
not
deferred
irrevocably
to
termination.
mr.
carl
valvo
this
record
permits
that
inference,
but--
mr.
carl
valvo
--but,
it
also
permits
the
inference
that
the
employee
could
have
deferred
vacation
time,
and
taken
vacation
time.
there's
nothing...
the
record,
i
agree,
is
not
fully
developed
on
this
score.
it
was
the...
a
stipulation
at
a
motion
to
dismiss
stage,
but--
mr.
carl
valvo
--well,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
requires
you
to
find
that
there
was
an
irrevocable
deferral
to
termination
or
beyond.
the
records
simply
states...
this
is
page
19
of
the
joint
appendix,
"it
is
agreed
that
the
bank
made
oral,
and,
or
written
agreements,
and
that
such
agreements
promised
employees
payment,
in
lieu
of
unused
vacation
time.
"
that's
all
it
says,
and
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
when
those
payments
had
to
be
made.
another
difference
between
severance
and
vacation,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
severance
would
be
payable,
over
and
above
any
wages
or
other
forms
of
compensation
that
might
be
due,
whereas
vacation
pay
is
payable
at
termination,
only
if
there's
some
unused
vacation
left.
not
all
employees
will
have
all
of
that
unused
vacation,
in
which
case,
when
they're
terminated,
that's
it,
and
they
get
nothing,
unless
there's
a
severance
agreement.
now,
the
secretary's
(b)...
the
(b)(3)
portion
of
the
regulation,
i
think,
has
to
be
looked
at
with
two
interrelated
factors
in
mind.
one,
is
that
these
vacation
payments
are
closely
akin
to
wages,
for
a
variety
of
reasons,
some
of
which
i've
already
mentioned.
but,
secondly,
and
it's
an
interrelated
point,
these
payments
are
paid
out
of
the
general
assets
of
the
employer...
not
out
of
a
trust
fund.
those
two
factors,
together,
both
of
which
are
necessary,
but
not
sufficient
in
and
of
themselves,
come
together
to
create
a
benefit
which
the
secretary
concluded
was
not
a...
the
type
of
benefit
that
congress
intended
to
reach,
and
that
they
were
payroll
practices,
routine
in
the...
in
the--
mr.
carl
valvo
--well,
then
we're
talking
about
(b)(1).
they
stayed
on--
mr.
carl
valvo
--it
depends
on
how
you
look
at
it.
mr.
carl
valvo
because,
if
you
see
these
payments
as
an
aggregation
of
the
monies
that
would
be
paid...
here's
the
termination
date,
and
they
have
unused
vacation
time
left.
if
you
look
at
these
payments
as
aggregating
what
would
be
payable
in
that
vacation
time...
payable
on
the
date
of
termination.
that
would
be
time
they
would
perform
no
duties.
mr.
carl
valvo
well,
it's,
it's...
imagine
an
employee
who
has...
he's
hired
with
the
understanding
that
he
accrues
one
day
of
vacation
a
month.
at
the
six-month
point
of
his
employment,
he's
fired.
now,
he
has
six
days
of
vacation
coming.
how
do
we
treat
that?
do
we
treat
it
as
payment
for
time
worked?
we
can,
and
we
look
at
(b)(1).
or,
do
we
have
six
days
of
vacation
coming,
meaning
vacation
days
which
he
would
be
able
to
take,
perform
no
duties,
and
still
receive
regular
pay.
if
that's
the
way
we
look
at
it,
then
we
look
at
(b)(3).
we
win
either
way.
mr.
carl
valvo
that's
what
we
have
here.
mr.
carl
valvo
well,
it's
interpreting
the
payroll
practices
regulation,
which
includes--
mr.
carl
valvo
--(b)(1).
i
would
say
(b)(3),
but
the
brief...
i
think
that's
what
the--
mr.
carl
valvo
--well,
i'm
happy
to
accept
that,
you
know,
i
would
like
you
to--
mr.
carl
valvo
--well,
your
honor,
the
difficulty
is
that
these
vacation
payments,
can
be
viewed
in
different
ways.
one
can
look
at
it
in
an
economic
sense--
mr.
carl
valvo
--yes.
mr.
carl
valvo
i
think
that
it
was
referring
only
to
the...
a
footnote
that
described
severance,
the
distinction
between
severance
and
vacation.
but
it...
but
we're
talking
about...
the
secretary
in
this
case
is
focusing
on
(b)(3),
interpreting
(b)(3)
to
cover
our
case,
and
we're
certainly
happy
to
accept
it.
in
fact,
we
argue
that
we
rely
on
(b)(3).
but,
we
have
another
string
to
our
bow,
and
that's
(b)(1),
and,
whether
you
look
at
these
payments
in
an
economic
sense...
i
think
that
would
steer
you
to
(b)(1).
if
you
look
at
vacation
payments
in
the
sort
of
(b)(3).
either
way,
we
win.
now,
even
if
the
arrangement
here
is
a
vacation
benefit
plan,
section
148
is
not
preempted,
because
it's
a
generally
applicable
criminal
law,
saved
from
preemption
under
section
514,
(b)(4).
everyone
in
the
case
agrees
that
a
generally
applicable
criminal
law
is
one
that's
not
specifically
aimed
at
erisa
plans.
we
say
that
if
a
vacation
benefit
can
be
delivered
by
means,
other
than
a
plan,
as
the
sjc
contemplated,
then
a
vacation
payment
statute
is
not
specifically
aimed
at
erisa
plans,
and
is,
therefore,
generally
applicable.
mr.
carl
valvo
a
statute...
certainly,
a
statute
that
made
it
a
crime
not
to
pay
pension
payments,
or
not
to
make
contributions
into
a
erisa
welfare
benefit
plan.
that
would
certainly
be
a...
not
a
generally
applicable
criminal
law,
because
it
would
be
aimed
directly
at
erisa
activity.
i
would
go
one
step
further.
a
statute
that
made
it
a
crime
not
to
pay
wages,
and
made
it
a
crime
not
to
pay
pension
payments,
would
also
be
preempted,
because
part
of
its
prohibited
conduct
can
only
be
engaged
in
in
an
erisa
context.
now,
let's--
mr.
carl
valvo
--well,
it
applies
to
activity
beyond
erisa
and,
therefore,
when
we're
talking
about
an
exemption
from
erisa,
we
have
to
assume
that
congress,
in
using
the
term,
which
has
received
no
attention
in
the
legislative
history,
was
thinking,
in
terms
of
erisa,
what
is
generally
applicable
beyond
erisa.
mr.
carl
valvo
that's
correct,
your
honor.
this
is
an
alternative.
mr.
carl
valvo
well,
if
a
generally
applicable
criminal
law--
mr.
carl
valvo
--can
be
applied
to
an
erisa
activity,
but
it
has
to
be
able
to
apply
to
conduct
beyond
erisa
activity.
let
me
give
you
an
example.
mr.
carl
valvo
if
those
benefits
were
delivered
only
by
erisa
plan.
mr.
carl
valvo
well,
we
don't
know
that.
if
we're
talking--
mr.
carl
valvo
--yes.
yes.
mr.
carl
valvo
xxx
even
if
it
says--
mr.
carl
valvo
--well,
your
honor,
if
the
activity...
if
the
prohibited
conduct,
includes
activity
that
can
be
engaged
in,
outside
of
an
erisa
context,
then
congress
was
willing
to
tolerate
some
supplementation,
or
touching
of
erisa
by
criminal
laws.
otherwise,
there
would
be
no
exemption
from
514(a)'s
general
blanket
preemption.
mr.
carl
valvo
but,
we
have
to
assume,
that
since
it's
an
exemption
from
514(a),
that
the
same
rules
that
apply
to
generally
applicable
civil
statutes,
don't
apply
to
generally
applicable
criminal
statutes,
and
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
for
this.
first
of...
i
think,
the
language,
sjc
would
limit
it
to.
for
instance,
larceny
and
embezzlement
statutes.
if
congress
wanted
to
write
a
statute
like
that,
it
could
easily
have
said
"larceny
and
embezzlement"
or
"criminal
misappropriation
of
property".
something
like
that.
but,
it
didn't.
it
said
"generally
applicable
criminal
law".
secondly,
there
is
a
presumption
that
operates
in
favor
of
preserving
historic
police
powers.
now,
i
agree,
that
that
presumption
has
been
overcome,
with
respect
to
514(a),
and
generally
applicable
civil
statutes.
but
congress
has
not
clearly
stated
an
intention
to,
or
at
least,
where
the
definition
of...
where
the
dividing
line
is,
from
separating
criminal
laws,
which
it
seeks
to
save,
and
those
which
it
seeks
to
preempt.
and
we
think
that
the
presumption
in
favor
of
historic
police
powers,
in
the
absence
of
a
clear
statement
by
congress,
operates
here.
in
massachusetts...
in
metropolitical
life
v.
massachusetts,
the
court
used
that
presumption
in,
in
interpreting
the
insurance...
the
insurance
law
exemption
from
preemption,
and
it
saved
the
statute
for
massachusetts.
the
same
presumption
has
force
here,
perhaps
a
fortiori,
since
criminal
law
is
at
least
as
deserving
of,
of
protection
from
the
presumption
as
an
insurance
law
would.
finally,
there's
no
reason
to
conclude
that
congress
wanted
to
give
that
term,
514(b)
would
also
be
subject
to
regular
conflict
analysis
under
preemption.
that
is,
to
say,
if
a
generally
applicable
criminal
law...
even
like
148.
if
that
could
be
shown
to
actually
conflict
with
a
provision
of
erisa
to
prevent
the
effectuation
of
the
federal
purpose,
then
it
would
have
trouble
under
conflict
analysis.
so,
in
conclusion,
because
congress
did
not
intend
to
displace
state
non-payment
of
wage
statutes,
as
applied
to
vacation
pay,
the
sjc's
decision
should
be
reversed.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions.
mr.
carl
valvo
unless
the
court
has
questions,
i
can
rest
on
my
arguments,
sir.
