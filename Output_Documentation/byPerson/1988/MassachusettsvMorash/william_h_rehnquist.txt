justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
88-32,
massachusetts
v.
morash.
mr.
valvo,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
it's
at
page
11?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but,
the
hypothesis
for
(b)(3),
or
one
of
the
hypotheses
for
invoking
it,
as
i
read
it,
is
that,
during
the
time
a
person,
the
employee,
performs
no
duties.
here,
these
people
did
perform
duties.
they
stayed
home
from
their
vacation.
so,
i
don't
see
how
(b)(3)
can
apply.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but,
i
mean,
i
thought--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--well,
how
does
one
look
at
(b)(3),
and
get
it
to
apply?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
that
really
takes
some
kind
of
astigmatism
to
look
at
it
that
way,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but,
how
can
we
know
whether
it
would?
how
can
we
know
whether
it's
a
reasonable
interpretation,
unless
we
know
which
of
two
separate
regulations
it's
interpreting?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you
mr.
valvo.
mr.
berger,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
have
about
one
minute.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
valvo,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
88-32,
massachusetts
against
morash
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
