justice
stevens
but
one
can
also
read
that
this
is
compensation
for
time
not
worked.
i
mean
you--
justice
stevens
--it's
in
lieu
of
the
vacation.
it's
not...
maybe,
i
didn't
quite
understand
your
argument.
justice
stevens
correct.
justice
stevens
no,
but
he
has
been
compensated
for
that
week.
justice
stevens
but,
if
he
takes
that,
he's
not
getting
paid
for
time
worked,
cause
he
got
paid
during
the
49th
week.
i
mean,
one...
i'm
just
saying
one
can
look
at
this
in
different
ways--
justice
stevens
--if
you
just
look
at
the
language
of
the
regulation.
justice
stevens
how
important
are
those
words,
"entrusted
with
that
fund",
because
the
point
of
the
regulation
is,
there's
no
trust
fund.
it's
just
payment
by
the
employer
directly.
he
hasn't
set
aside
anything
in
a
trust.
justice
stevens
that's
a
distinction
the
government
draws.
justice
stevens
but
then,
why
don't
you
lose
under
that
distinction...
that
what
i
don't
understand.
justice
stevens
because
the
regulation
just
reads
right
on
it.
"payment
by
an
employer
of
compensation,
on
account
of
work
performed.
"
justice
stevens
yes,
but
on
account
of
work
that
had
been
performed
prior
to
termination,
because
he
had
earned
so
many
days
of
vacation,
for
which
he
had
not
been
paid.
in
other
words,
if
he
gets
two
weeks
a
year,
he
works
six
months,
and
he
gets
fired
without
having
taken
the
two
weeks,
he's
entitled
to
one
week's
pay,
on
account
of
the
six
months
he
had
previously
worked.
justice
stevens
well,
but
the
point
is
that
then
the
regulation
just
reads
right
on
your
case.
justice
stevens
no,
no.
i'm
talking
about
the
(b)(1)
part,
the
(b)(1)
part.
the
(b)(1)
payments,
and
just
as
we've
described
it...
it's
a
payment
by
an
employer
of
compensation,
as
compensated,
on
account
of
work
performed,
during
the
six
months
with...
where
he
never
got
any
vacation.
he's
earned
a
week's
free
vacation
that
he
didn't
get,
and
that's...
that's
exactly
what
the
regulation
says.
justice
stevens
what
if
you
get
a
christmas
bonus
every
year
of
$10
a
month,
say
for
every
month
where
he
had...
so
he
got
$120
coming
at
christmas.
he
worked
six
months,
and
they
fire
him,
or
terminate,
and
so
he
would
normally
get
the
$60.00.
would
that
be
covered
by
this
or
not?
wouldn't
that
be
just
like
the
vacation?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
on
this
record,
we
don't
know,
or
do
we...
i'm
not
entirely
clear.
we
don't
know
whether
this
is
just
accrued
vacation
within
a
given
year,
when
there
was
a
termination,
or
they
had
saved
up
vacation
for
two
or
three
years.
justice
stevens
oh,
that's
right,
up
to
january.
justice
stevens
if
you
have
several
employers,
and
you
have
a
trustee
funding
the
whole
thing,
it
doesn't
fit.
justice
stevens
i
think
you're
not
understanding
here
xxx.
justice
stevens
but,
the
regulation
wouldn't
read
on
that
case.
justice
stevens
well,
except
it's
not
payment
by
an
employer
in
that
case.
justice
stevens
except
for
the
distinction
that
the
government
relies
on.
distinction
between
a
funded
plan,
and
a
non-funded
plan.
justice
stevens
mr.
berger,
i
haven't
read
the
american
motors
opinion.
is
a
citation
of
that
in
your
brief?
justice
stevens
it's
in
the
solicitor's
brief?
justice
stevens
would
you...
do
you
happen
to
have
it
handy?
well,
i
can
find
it,
i
guess.
justice
stevens
thank
you.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
another
question,
mr.
berger?
justice
stevens
i
guess
i
really
didn't
understand
this
case.
what
if
an
employer
had
a
practice
of...
every
time
it
fires
an
employee,
he
gives
them
two
weeks
pay.
he
doesn't
give
two
weeks
notice.
that's
the
customary
practice.
is
that
a
severance
plan...
and
just
pays
it
out
of
general
assets?
justice
stevens
that
would
be
covered
by
erisa?
justice
stevens
every
employer
who
has
that
kind
of
practice
is
covered
by
this
statute,
must
maintain
all
the
recordkeeping,
and
all
the
rest
of
it?
justice
stevens
well
then,
i
think
probably
every
employer
in
the
country
must
be
covered
by
the
statute.
because
everybody
has
some
kind
of
severance
policy,
i
suppose,
when
they--
justice
stevens
--i
mean,
even
if
they
give
him
one
day's
pay,
or
a
watch,
or
something,
that
would
be
a--
justice
stevens
--have
to
be
cash?
justice
stevens
why?
justice
stevens
does
the
statute
require
benefits
be
payable
in
cash?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
which
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
requires
us
to
determine
whether
a
company’s
policy
of
paying
its
discharge
employees’
vacation
time
constitutes
an
employee
welfare
benefit
plan
within
the
meaning
of
section
3(1)
of
the
employee
retirement
income
security
act.
in
may
of
1986,
petitioner,
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts,
started
criminal
complaints
against
the
president
of
a
bank
alleging
that
he
had
violated
the
massachusetts
payment
of
wages
statute
by
failing
to
compensate
two
discharged
bank
vice
presidents
for
vacation
time
they
had
accrued
but
did
not
use.
leaving
that
the
bank’s
policy
to
pay
employees
accrued
vacation
pay
in
lump
sums
upon
termination
be
in
erisa
plan,
the
supreme
judicial
court
held
that
the
prosecution
was
preempted
by
the
federal
statute.
we
reverse.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
hold
that
the
reference
in
erisa
to
a
“plan,
fund,
or
program
that
provide
vacation
benefits”
should
be
understood
to
include
within
the
scope
of
erisa
vacation
benefit
funds
in
which
the
employee’s
right
to
a
benefit
is
contingent
upon
a
future
occurrence
or
the
employee
bears
a
risk
different
from
his
normal
employment
risk
that
should
not
be
construed
to
include
a
single
employer’s
policy
to
pay
employees
for
unused
vacation
time
from
its
general
assets.
the
bank’s
policy
to
pay
employees
a
good
vacation
time
upon
termination
does
not
constitute
an
employee
welfare
benefit
plan
and
the
prosecution,
accordingly,
is
not
preempted
by
erisa.
