justice

they
covered
elsewhere.
justice
scalia
covered
elsewhere
in
the
statute.
if
that's
all
it
covers,
it
covers
nothing
of
the
statute
doesn't
cover
elsewhere.
justice
scalia
mr.
valvo,
why
does
the
regulation
cover
this?
i
mean,
you
talk
as
though
it's
clear
that
the
regulation
applies
to
what
happened
here,
but
all
the
regulation,
as
i
read
it,
necessarily
covers,
is...
is
an
understanding
between
an
employer
and
an
employee,
that
he
continues
to
receive
salary
when
he's
on
vacation,
period.
justice
scalia
why
don't
we
look
at
where...
where
is
it
in
the--
justice
scalia
--is
this
it?
justice
scalia
well,
that...
i...
do
you
think
a
worker
who...
i
mean,
do
we
know
that
a
worker
who
has,
let's
say,
two
weeks
of
vacation
pay
that
he
hasn't
taken
in
a
particular
year...
could
he
have
come
up
to
the
employer,
and
said,
"i
want
payment
for
those
two
weeks
that
i
didn't
take.
"
do
we
know
that
from
the
record?
justice
scalia
oh,
it
does?
justice
scalia
well,
but,
if
that
makes
a
difference,
then
i
don't
know
how
we're
suppose
to
handle
it?
justice
scalia
let's
take
the
example
you've
already
given...
a
statute,
you
say,
that
applies
to
employee
benefits,
you
say,
would
not
be
generally
applicable?
justice
scalia
ah,
but,
all
it
says
is
employee
benefits.
justice
scalia
all
it
says,
is,
"any
failure
to
pay
employee
benefits.
"
now,
some
of
those
will
be
erisa
benefits,
and
some
won't.
so,
you
say,
that
would
be
generally
applicable?
justice
scalia
so,
you
pretty
much
have
to
have
a
state
law
that
says...
makes
it
a
crime
to
fail
to
comply
with
erisa?
justice
scalia
do
you
think
that's
what
congress
meant
by
"generally
applicable"?
justice
scalia
it
could
have
said,
"any
state
law
that
applies
beyond
erisa...
that
applies
to
any
activity,
other
than
erisa
activity.
"
it
didn't
say
that.
it
said,
"generally
applicable
state
laws".
justice
scalia
what
if
he
gives
you
money
for
the
two
weeks
that
you
didn't
take?
justice
scalia
at
the
end
of
this
year,
he
gives
you
money
for
the
two
weeks
you
didn't
take?
justice
scalia
maybe
the
answer
to
justice
stevens
questions
is,
that
you
can't
(b)(1)
that
way,
because
the
secretary
doesn't
read
it
that
way,
because
the
secretary
acknowledges
that
if
you
have
a
joint
vacation
arrangement...
the
employee
is
working
for
a
number
of
different
employers,
and
the
vacation
is
funded,
then
it
would,
indeed,
be
an
employee
welfare
benefit
plan.
but,
the
reason
being,
that
it's
not
a
payment
by
an
employer.
it's
a
payment
by
a
trustee.
that's
the
key
words
here...
"payment
by
an
employer".
