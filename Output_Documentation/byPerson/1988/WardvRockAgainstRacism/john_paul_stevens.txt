mr....
mr.
koerner,
may
i
ask
about
the
tension?
did
the...
the
excess
sound,
having
it
too
loud,
violate
any
city
ordinance
or
any
city
rule?
justice
stevens
were...
were
the...
and
the
violation
of
that
guideline
is
subject
to
penalties.
justice
stevens
and...
and
why
didn't
the
city
collect
those
penalties--
justice
stevens
--if
they
had
the
right
to?
justice
stevens
but
why
wouldn't
that
be
an
adequate
means
of
preventing
excessive
sound
in
following
years?
justice
stevens
well,
maybe
you
could
deny
them
a
permit.
i
suppose
one
of
the
remedies
would
be
denial
of
a
permit
for
violation
of
the
law
preceding
years.
justice
stevens
well,
whenever
you
enforce
a
law,
you
get
in
litigation.
i
mean,
that's
one
of
the...
one
of
the
things
you
have
to
do
to
enforce
the
law
is
you
have
to
litigate.
justice
stevens
but
may
i...
may
i
inquire?
supposing
you
had
a
less
sophisticated
problem
and
maybe
a
little
different
area
that
you
want
to
avoid
excessive
sound
in
and
the
drummer
played
much
too
loud
and
they
couldn't
get
him
to
quiet
down,
or
the
trumpet
player
played
much
too
loud.
could
the
city
say,
well,
we
can't
seem
to
get
him
to
control
it,
so
we're
going
to
insist
on
having
our
own
drummer
in
this
band?
justice
stevens
why
not?
what's
the
difference?
justice
stevens
and
he's
good.
he's
every
bit
as
good
as
your
mixer
and
all
the
rest.
he's
a
talented
artist.
justice
stevens
well,
he
just
plays
too
loud
for
the...
for
the
surroundings,
and
they
keep
saying
to
him,
hey,
you're
too
loud.
and
he
says,
well,
this
is
the
way
i
play.
justice
stevens
by...
by
putting
in
your
own
drummer.
justice
stevens
no,
no.
you
don't
have
any
fancy...
you
just
have
old-fashioned
musical
instruments
and
in
a
living
room
or
a
smaller
area.
and
you
have
a
regulation
in
this
neighborhood
you
can't...
you
can't
have
excessive
sound
more
than
x
number
of
decibels.
and
you
say
it's
too
much
trouble
to
enforce
it
by
arresting
people
and
putting
them
in
jail.
so,
you
say,
well,
we'll
insist
on
having
cur
own
drummer
in
this
band
or
our
own
trumpet
player.
justice
stevens
what's
the
difference?
justice
stevens
well,
no.
you
say
your
drummer...
he'll
play
it
exactly
the
way...
he'll
play
exactly
the
way
your
arranger
thinks
it
ought
to
be
played.
justice
stevens
and
he's
good.
justice
stevens
no,
i'm
not
substituting.
just
have
a
different
performer.
justice
stevens
no,
i'm
assuming
it
doesn't.
i'm
assuming
it
doesn't.
they
just
say
we'd
like
to
have
our
own
drummer.
justice
stevens
like
we'd
like
to
have
our
own
mixer.
justice
stevens
why?
justice
stevens
well,
yes.
you've
got
to
use
city
on
drums,
too--
justice
stevens
--like
you
say
you
got
to
use
city-owned
mixing
equipment.
justice
stevens
which
is
exactly
what's
happening
here.
justice
stevens
--let
me
go
back
to
kovacs
for
a
second.
there
they
can
fix
the
level
of
sound
that
the
sound
truck
can...
can
distribute
in
the
neighborhood.
justice
stevens
could
the
city
have
said
we
want
our
own
driver
on
the
truck?
justice
stevens
we
want
our
own
driver
on
the
truck.
he's
just
as
good
as
your
driver
and
he...
we're
sure
that...
that
he'll
keep
the
sound
levels
down.
justice
stevens
sure,
he'd
control
it
and
he'd
follow
all
the--
justice
stevens
--that's
right.
justice
stevens
that's
exactly
right.
justice
stevens
but,
mr.
kunstler,
let
me
interrupt.
you...
you
agreed
earlier
that
noise
control
is
permissible
or
something.
did
you
mean
to
say
that
you
can
control
noise
by
using
a
state
employee?
supposing
you
just
had
a
sound
amplification
system
in
a...
we
may
be
making
speeches
and
all
the
rest.
you
don't
want
it
to
get
too
loud
because
it
disturbs
the
neighbors.
can
you...
do
you
concede
that
the
state
could
insist
on
having
its
own
employee
at
the
microphone?
justice
stevens
oh,
well,
that's--
justice
stevens
but
you
don't
agree
that
the--
justice
stevens
--well,
i
thought
you
had.
i
thought
you
had
agreed.
justice
stevens
oh,
okay.
so,
you
would
make
basically
the
same
argument
if
this
was
just
you
didn't
have
the
mix
to
make
it
more
of
an
artistic
thing,
but
you
just
say
the
part
of
the
artistic
presentation
is
the
sound
volume,
and
we
do
not
agree
that
you
can
have
a
state
employee
sitting
with
his
thumb
on
the...
on
the
button.
justice
stevens
but,
mr.
kunstler,
i
don't
understand
what
the
source
of
their
obligation
to
negotiate
is.
if
they
picked
your
110
decibel
level
and
said
that's
what
we
think
is
reasonable
and
you
comply
with
it
or
you
don't
get
a
permit,
what
would
be
wrong
with
that?
justice
stevens
so,
i
mean,
there
really
is
no
constitutional
obligation
to
negotiate
with
you.
they
can
make
the
rule
that
they
think
would
protect
the--
justice
stevens
--the
citizens'
interest--
justice
stevens
--is
there
any
testimony--
justice
stevens
not
only
different
instruments,
but
different--
justice
stevens
--no.
it's
not
just
different
instruments,
different
weather
conditions.
if
the
wind
is
blowing--
justice
stevens
--in
one
direction,
you
won't
hear
it
in
the
sheep
meadow.
