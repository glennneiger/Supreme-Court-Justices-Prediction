are
you
saying
that
the
troubles
with
rar
was
the
reason
for
the
adoption
of
the
ordinance?
justice
kennedy
mr.
koerner,
the--
--is
it
your
position
that
the
quality
of
the
sound
is
the
same
whether
or
not
the
technician
is
the
city
technician
or
the
rock
technician?
justice
kennedy
so,
the
sound
technician
is
not
as
important
as,
say,
a
conductor
of
a
symphony?
justice
kennedy
i
might
have
had
some
trouble
with
that
proposition
if
it
just
depended
on
my
own
knowledge,
but
the
record
seems
to
bear
you
out.
justice
kennedy
but
just
before
we
leave
that
point,
there
is
no
finding
that
it
is
not
feasible
from
a
technical
standpoint
for
one
person
to
control
volume
and
the
other
mixing?
justice
kennedy
how
does
the...
how
does
the
city
technician
know
when
it's
too
loud?
justice
kennedy
but
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
bear
you
out.
the
trial
court
said
that
you
suggested
this
for
the
first
time
only
upon
information
and
belief
after
the
trial
and
that
the
evidence
to
the
effect
at
trial
was
to
the
contrary.
justice
kennedy
but
that's
not
the
finding
of
the
district
court,
mr.
kunstler.
justice
kennedy
i
should
have
thought
that
is
true,
but
the
record
doesn't
bear
it
out.
justice
kennedy
do
you
concede
the
constitutionality
o'
a
separate
sound
control?
justice
kennedy
and
you
agree
the
record
is
ambiguous
as
to
whether
sound
affects
mix?
justice
kennedy
does...
rar
is
not
a
performing
group
itself,
is
it?
justice
kennedy
and
so...
so,
you
actually
want
to
use
your
mixer
for
other
bands?
justice
kennedy
but
aren't
you
doing
the
same
thing
the
city
is
doing?
justice
kennedy
a
hundred
percent
of
the
bands
chose
your
promoter
your...
your
technician
rather
than
the
city's?
justice
kennedy
well,
but
it's
important
if
you're
saying
each...
each
group
has
to
have
its
own
technician
and
it's
like
zubin
mehta,
and
now
you're
saying
that
rar
does
it
for
all
the
groups
that
appear.
justice
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
quite
inconsistent.
justice
kennedy
well,
is
there
testimony
that
any
of
the
specific
groups
objected
to
the
city's
technician?
justice
kennedy
--excuse
me.
is
there
any
testimony
in
this
record
that
a
decibel
level
is
technically
feasible
for
controlling
rock
music?
