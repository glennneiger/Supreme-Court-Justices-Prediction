justice
white
well,
if...
if...
if
the
city
is
going
to
reflect
the
mix
a
performer
wants,
why
does
the
city
want
control
of
the
mix?
justice
white
so,
you
say
there's
just
no
practical
way
of
just
controlling
the
sound?
justice
white
you
have
to
do
them
both
together.
justice
white
--that's
right.
well,
how
does...
excuse
me.
how
do...
how
does
the
city
control
the
sound?
it
controls
the
mix
and
the
sound.
justice
white
right,
right.
well,
why...
let's
assume
there
wasn't
a
city...
the
city
hadn't
put
this
scheme
in
and
that
the
performers
were
allowed
to
use
their
own
equipment
and...
to
control
the
mix.
why
couldn't
a
city
technician
sit
with
the
performer's
technician
and
control
the
sound?
justice
white
well,
here's
the
city
with
its
own
equipment
sitting
there
with
a
technician
control
ling
the
mix
and
the
sound.
they
have
next
to
them
a
technician
from
the
performers
who...
who,
in
effect,
control
the
mix.
justice
white
why
doesn't
that
create
the
confrontation?
justice
white
well,
you...
and
your...
the
government
interest
is
controlling
sound
here.
justice
white
and...
but
you
not
only
control
the
sound,
but
you
control
the
mix.
and...
and
controlling
the
mix
as
such
doesn't
serve
your
interests
in
controlling
the
sound.
it's
just
that
you...
you
say
there...
you
just
can't
separate
them.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but...
i
know,
but...
but
here
your
regulation
is
such
that
it...
it
by...
controlling
the
mix
doesn't
necessarily
serve
the
government
interest
of
controlling
the
sound.
justice
white
well,
if
you're
going
to
let
the
performers'
technician
sit
with
the
city's
technician,
i
don't
know
why
that
isn't
the
same
confrontation.
justice
white
but
you...
but
you
say
that
the
city
will
let
a...
the
performer's
technician
sit
with
the
city
technician.
justice
white
and
dictate
the
mix.
justice
white
what
would
you
do
about--
justice
white
--what
would
you
do...
what
would
you
do
about
clark
and
albertini?
justice
white
well,
they
said--
justice
white
--i
know,
but
this
is
a
time,
place
and
manner
question,
isn't
it?
justice
white
let's
assume
it
is.
justice
white
assume
it
is.
assume
it's
a
time,
place
and
manner
restriction.
then
albertini
and
clark
say
that
the
least
restrictive
alternative
hasn't
any
place
in
this
kind
of
analysis.
justice
white
well,
it's
a...
it's
saying
what
you
have
to
do
if
you
want
to
make
noise
in
a
park.
justice
white
i
wouldn't
think
you
would.
justice
white
well,
it
was
the
court's
opinion.
justice
white
well,
you...
you
mentioned
that
one
of
the
possible
alternatives
was
the
automatic
governor--
justice
white
--that
would
just
be
attached
to
the
machine
and
here
would
be
a...
here
would
be
a
state
instrument.
justice
white
well,
i
know
it
wouldn't
be
run.
it
would
be
automatic.
justice
white
and
so,
when
it
gets
too
loud,
it
just
turns
it
down.
justice
white
well,
would
that
be
constitutional?
justice
white
i
know
but
it's
something
that...
it's
something
that
the
state
insists
on.
it
insists
that...
that
people
putting
on
the
concert
have
this
automatic
noise
regulator
on
their
machine.
justice
white
but
the
finding
is
that...
that
the
state
would
do
whatever
the...
whatever
your
client
told
them
to
do
about
the
mix.
justice
white
well,
you
did
say...
you
did
say
the
court...
the
finding
was
just
wrong
then.
justice
white
well,
after
consideration.
justice
white
but
he
never...
it's...
i
thought
the
way
you
judge
this
case
on
the
basis
that
the
state...
the
state
employee
will
follow
the
directions
about
mix
given
to
him
by
the
performer.
justice
white
so,
the
judge
just
didn't
know
what
he
was
talking
about.
