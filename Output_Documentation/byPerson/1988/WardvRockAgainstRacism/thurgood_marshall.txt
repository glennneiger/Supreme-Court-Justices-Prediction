is
there
any
such
thing
as
quiet
rock
music?
[laughter]
justice
marshall
you're
dealing...
you're
dealing
with
loudness.
justice
marshall
and
how
loud
is
loud?
justice
marshall
well,
that's
a
hard
thing
to
do.
justice
marshall
kovacs
was
the
difference
between
a
loudspeaker
and
an
ordinary
voice.
justice
marshall
but
this
is
not
involved
in
this.
justice
marshall
going
back
to
kovacs--
justice
marshall
you'd
certainly
have
a
different
decibel
level
for
the
philharmonic
and
these
rock
bands,
wouldn't
you?
justice
marshall
as
loud
as
a
rock
band?
justice
marshall
sorry
i
asked.
