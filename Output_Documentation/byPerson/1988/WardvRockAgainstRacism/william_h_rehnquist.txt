mr.

chief
justice
rehnquist
--mr.
kunstler,
as
i
understand
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
here,
they
said
that
the
city
had
to
use
the
least
intrusive
means
of
regulating
the
volume
in
your
opinion,
is
that
the
correct
test
under
our
cases?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
what...
what
is
the
leading
case
from
our
court,
do
you
think,
that
supports
that
proposition?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
what
is
the
principal
case
you
would
rely
on
here
to
us
for
the
proposition
that
the
city
must
use
the
least
intrusive
means?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
kunstler.
