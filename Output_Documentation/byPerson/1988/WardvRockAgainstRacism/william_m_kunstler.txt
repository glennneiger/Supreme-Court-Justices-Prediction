mr.
william
m.
kunstler
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i
want
to
start
with
agreeing
in
some
respects
with
justice
kennedy
with
reference
to
whether
the...
a
conductor
of
a
symphony
orchestra
is
like
the
man
who
does
the...
the
mix.
and
i
think
they
are
very
comparable.
the
man
that
does
the
mix,
as
all
the
testimony
indicates...
i
think
on
direct
mr.
thompson
said
he's
part
of
the
band.
there
is
no
leader,
of
course.
he's
part
of
the
band.
and
then
the
city's
expert,
gary
floyd,
stated
that
"you
have
left
the
decisions
and
esthetic
choices
up
to
that
individual.
"
the
technician
at
the
console.
and
i
was
thinking
we
put
in
our
brief
several...
several
analogies
which
i
don't
think
are
particularly
apt
such
as
mixing
paints
and
so
on,
but
i
think
there's
a
better
analogy
which
would
fit
in
with
justice
kennedy's
question.
the
analogy
would
be
if
they
had
symphony
orchestras,
as
they
do,
play
in
central
park,
and
zubin
mehta
and
the
new
york
philharmonic
always
played
loud
and
therefore
the
city
said,
in
order
to
control
the
noise,
we're
going
to
put
georg
solti
in
there
because
he's
approved
by
everybody.
everybody
likes
him.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
no.
i
think
it
was
the
other
way
around
because
i
think
that
on
direct
alan
thompson
said
that
the
mixer
is
part
of
the
band.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
well,
i
think
that
the
testimony
then
is
belied
by
the
finding
or
the
finding
belied
by
the
testimony
because
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
it
was
uncontroverted
in
the
record,
that
the
mixer
is
part
of
the
band.
he's
the
esthetic
leader
of
the
band.
and
i
think
if
you
will
look
on
page
370
of
the...
of
fed.
2nd,
you
will
find
that
the...
that
the
unanimous
court
said
it
is
uncontroverted
in
the
record.
these
claims
are
not
controverted
in
the
record,
that
the
mixer
is
part
of
the
band.
he
is
the
esthetic
leader.
and
you
have
the
city's
own
technician...
own
expert,
mr.
floyd...
and
i
quote
him
here.
"you
have
left
the
decisions
and
esthetic
choices
up
to
that
individual.
"
the
technician
at
the
console.
it
is
on
joint
appendix
180.
so,
we
have
a
situation
where
everyone
agreed
that
the
mixer
is
not
just
a
mere
technician
who
turns
some
knobs
automatically.
he
is
the
leader
of
the
band.
he's
part
of
the
band.
and
to
say
that
you're
going
to
put
the
city
leader
of
the
band
in
there,
i
think
is
very
much
like
saying
you're
going
to
put
georg
sciti
in
because
he
plays
andante
and
doice
as
against
zubin
mehta
who
plays
loud
because
you're
doing
the
esthetic
mixing
with
reference
to
a
city
employee
whom
you
must
use.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
well,
i
quoted
to
you
what
was
said
both
by
alan
thompson
and
by
gary
floyd
and
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
about
that.
i
think
the
record
does
bear
it
out.
now,
with
reference
to
the
alternatives
here,
i...
i
was
somewhat
astonished
to
hear
you
say
that
it...
you
don't
use
alternatives
in
cases
like
this.
and
i
think
justice
stevens
mentioned
some.
there
are
five
alternatives
that
our
friends,
the
national
park
service
and
i
thought
their
brief
was
more
for
us
than
for
the
appellant
in
this
case...
the...
or
the
petitioner.
the
national
park
service
says
in
its
regulation...
this
is
the
solicitor
general's
brief
in...
page
21...
"in
implementing
its
regulation,
the
park
service
relies
on
a
number
of
alternatives.
"
ironically
it's...
they
add,
this
doesn't
include
what
the
new
york
city
department
of
parks
does.
and
there
are
five
alternatives
here
that
are
possible
short
of
putting
in
your
own
mixer.
one
is
a
limiter.
it
was
testified
to
during
the
trial.
there's
an
automatic
limiter
you
can
put
on
the
sound,
like
a
governor
on
an
engine.
second,
a
separate
sound
control
is
perfectly
feasible,
separate
and
off
the
console,
and
the
record
indicates
that.
thirdly,
ordinances,
which
they
say
they
don't
enforce.
but
there
are
ordinances.
new
york
city
has
an
anti-noise
ordinance,
and
there
are
nuisance
ordinances,
breach
of
the
peace
ordinances
and
so
on.
fourthly,
they
can
pull
the
plug.
that's
one
that
the
national
park
service
uses.
and
fifthly,
they
can
negotiate--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--but
they
pull
the--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--justice
scalia,
they
did
it
twice
here.
you'll
find
it
on
ja
140
to
141,
pulled
twice.
there
was
no
problem
at
all.
these
are
not
large
attended.
they
may
have
3,000.
they
may
have
1,000.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
well,
they
aid
it
twice
and
it
caused
no
problem
whatsoever.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
but
that's
the
last
resort
anyway.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
that's
the
last
resort.
even
the
park
service--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--well,
that's
the
last
resort,
but
there
are
so
many
before
you
even
reach
that
point.
what
about
a
limiter?
that
was
testified
to.
what
about
a
separate
sound
control
i
think
that
justice
white
was
talking
about?
what
about
enforcing
those
ordinances?
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
yes,
i
do
in...
because
i
think
they
have
a
right
to
regulate
sound.
now,
i
have
a
problem
with
that
because
i
know
how
much
sound
is
part
of
the
sound
of
a
rock
band,
and
i
have
a
certain
problem
with
it.
but
for
the
sake
of
this
argument,
they
have
a
right
i
think
to
control
sound,
and
i
would
agree
with
that.
we're
not
raising
the
question
that
they
don't
have
a
right
to
control
sound.
we
agree
they
do.
and
i'm
not
sure
a
constitutional
issue
is
involved
there
in
a
public
park.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
yes,
i
think
i
would
agree
with
that.
if
i
had
tried
this
case,
i
think
i
would
have
worked
in
more
about
the
question
of
sound
and
mix.
and
by
the
way,
the
only
three
complaints
here,
justice
kennedy,
were
three
letters
in
the
record.
i
think
they're
exhibits
h
1
to
3,
one
by
isaac
asimov,
three
letters
that
were
put
in
over
objection
as
hearsay
from
people
who
said
they
heard
the
sound
at
central
park
west.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
no,
it's
a
promoter.
it's
rock
against
racism.
they
have
usually
six
bands--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--for
the
bands
that
come
to
the
rar
concerts.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
well,
no,
but
they
choose
him.
it's
the
same
thing
that
the
new
york
philharmonic
does
when
it
chooses
zubin
mehta.
they
choose
him.
the
bands
want
to
work
with
him.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
oh,
i
don't
know
if
there
was
a
vote
on
it,
but
every
year
we
get
much
the
same
bands.
alan
thompson--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--yes.
they
do
it--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--they
do
it
for
all
with
the
consent
of
the
groups.
he
works
with
the
groups
before
they
get
there.
he
works
with
them
when
they're
there.
they
know
him
from
past
experience,
and
they
like
what
he
does.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
no,
they
never
had
it,
not
these
groups.
they
never
had
it
because
they...
there
was
a
dispensation
for
them.
they
got
the...
the
injunction,
and
then
they
got
the
ruling
of
the
court
of
appeals,
sc,
there
is
nothing
in
record
about
that.
i
might
add
that
the
one
way
that
i
think
is
most
feasible
is
negotiating
the
decibel
level.
and
there's
a
misstatement
in
the
reply
brief
of
the
petitioner.
on
page
8,
they
say
the
evidence
also
showed
that
rar
repeatedly
violated
agreed-upon
sound
levels
in
the
face
of
repeated
requests
by
police
to
reduce
the
sound.
that
is
untrue.
and
if
you
look
at
the
joint
appendix
references
there,
you
will
find
nothing
in
there
about
agreed-upon
sound
levels
at
all.
they
never
proposed
that.
in
fact,
as
the
court
of
appeals
found...
and
i'm
quoting
from
page
371...
the
city
rejected
the
alternative
of
negotiating
a
decibel
level
for
each
event
with
the
sponsor.
they
rejected
what
would
be
the
least
intrusive
and
the
least
restrictive
way,
which
would
be
negotiating
a
decibel
level,
which
is
exactly
what
the
national
park
service
does.
that's
one
of
their
recommended
alternatives.
and,
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
is
the
most
feasible
way.
you
don't
intrude.
you
don't
force
them
to
use
a
conductor
they
don't
want
or
a
sound
mixer
they
don't
want.
and
you
negotiate
a
decibel
level.
it
was
never
done
in
this
case.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
well,
there
are...
just
what
the
park
service
says
it
does.
number
one,
the
park
service
says...
and
they
spell
it
out
very
clearly...
that
when
the
volume
gets
over
the
level,
they
send
over
a
representative
or
a
ranger,
park
ranger,
who
says
you're
over
it.
stop
it.
and
if
they
don't
stop
it,
then
you
have
the
alternatives
of
criminal
actions.
you
have
the
alternatives
of
pulling
the
plug,
which
i
would
say...
agree
with
you
should
be
the
last
in
any
concert.
and
by
the
way,
rock
against--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--that
is
that
evidence--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--that
evidence
is
in
the
record,
but
there
was
no
negotiated
decibel
level
before
the
concert.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
justice
scalia,
a
policeman
cannot
judge
decibel
level
without
an
instrument.
there
was
never
an
instrument
used
here
at
all.
there
is
a
way
to
measure
decibel
level.
the
park
service
uses
it.
the
police
department
is
not
equipped
to
do
that,
and
they
didn't
do
it.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
not
at...
not
at
all,
but
how
do
you
know
what
the
decibel
level--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--no.
there
was
no
agreement
as
to
decibel
level.
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
say.
no
agreement
whatsoever.
the
city
refused
to
negotiate
that,
and
that's
why
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
they
rejected
that
alternative.
if
there
had
been...
you
were
just
saying
to
me
a
policeman
said
it
was
too
loud.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
is
this
a
confession?
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i
know.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
but,
justice
scalia,
i
think
what
you're
saying
is
unrealistic.
what
happens
in
a
dorm
or
in
a
residential
house,
when
a
party
gets
too
loud
and
the
policeman
says
it's
too
loud,
is
different
as
to
whether
rock
music
or
music
is
bleeding
into
another
area.
and
they
have
tests
to
show
i
think...
it's
not
in
the
record,
but
i'll
tell
you
what
i
found,
that
110
decibels
is
the
proper
decibel
limit
not
to
go
into
the
sheep
meadow.
and
i
think
when
you've
got
to...
when
you've
got
a
thing
like
this,
you
can't
use
the
analogy
of
a
private
party.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
no,
but
110
is
the
maximum--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--is
the
maximum
decibel
strength
that
will
bleed
it
into
another
area.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
flutes
won't
do
that.
i
agree
with
you.
flutes
will
not
reach
that
decibel
level.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i
think
it
is.
i
think...
admitting
they
nave
a
right
to
control
noise,
which
i
admit,
i
think
that
the
least
intrusive
way
into
first
amendment
expression
must
be
used.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
well,
i
think
that
essentially
one
of
the
tests
which
i
think
was
used
in
o'brien,
although
i
don't
think
o'brien
and
that
four-prong
test
applies
here
when
they
use
the
term
"least
intrusive
means"...
i
think
in
many
of
your
cases...
none
are
like
this
case.
this
is
a
sui
generis
case.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i
think,
essentially
i
would
start
with
o'brien
and
go
through
some
of
the
other
cases
that
you've
talked
about,
boos
v.
barry,
maybe--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--maybe
frisby
v.
schultz.
i
mean,
there
are
a
number
of
cases.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i
don't
think
they
apply.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
sleeping
in
a
park
has
nothing
to
do
with
sound
levels.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i'm
not
even
sure
this
is
a
time,
place
and
manner.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
they
keep
talking
about
that.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
but
i
don't
think
this
is
a
time,
place
and
manner
at
all.
i
think
this
is
a
curd
on
free
expression.
this
is
an
attempt
to
regulate
free
expression.
music
is
within
the
first
amendment.
i
think
it's
an
attempt
to
regulate
it.
i
don't
think
it's
a
question
of
saying
time,
place
and
manner
like
sleeping
in
lafayette
park,
for
example,
or
albertini,
whether
you
can
get
on
after
being
kicked
off
a
military
reservation.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
well,
parks
are
a
place
where
you're
supposed
to
have
all
sorts
of
controversy.
i
think...
which
is
different
than
hickam
air
force
base
in
hawaii.
and
it's
different
than
lafayette
park.
i
don't
agree
with
clark.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
it's
community
control,
you
know.
[laughter]
and...
and...
and,
you
know,
i'm
sensitive
it
was
your
opinion
and
i'm
going
into
the
storm
by
saying--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--i
understand,
but
you
authored
it.
and
what
i'm
saying
is
this,
justice
white.
i
don't
think
it's
a
comparable
situation,
you're
really
not
talking
so
much
on...
although
i
agree
thoroughly
with
justice
marshall's
definition
and
analysis
of
sleep
in
conjunction
with
the
plight
of
the
homeless
in
lafayette
park,
but
here
you're
dealing
with
something
else.
you're
dealing
with
an
expression,
an
oral
expression
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
and
i
think
you
can
make
an
argument,
as
you
did,
that
sleep
is
not
such
an
oral
expression.
but
i
think
here
you're
dealing
with
an
oral
expression.
i
don't
really
think
this
is
a
time,
place
and
manner
case
at
all.
i
think
this
is
a
case,
can
you
control
artistic
expression
by
using
a
state
employee.
and
i
think
in
that
case,
you...
though
i
recognize
noise
can
be
controlled,
i
think
there
you
must
use
the
least
intrusive
way.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
no.
i
answered
justice
kennedy's
question
arguendo.
i
don't
think
that
noise
should
be
controlled
by
the
state
that...
constitutionally.
i
said,
thought,
i
would
agree
that
noise
can
be
controlled
in
some
fashion,
ordinances
or
what
have
you.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i
will
not
agree
to
the
constitutionality
aspect
of
it.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i
don't
want
to
give
that--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--i
thought
i
had,
too.
that's
why
i'm
making
this
second
statement.
[laughter]
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
and,
justice
stevens,
sound
is
an
integral
part
of
the
artistic
expression
of
rock
groups.
there's
no
question
about
it.
and
so,
i
didn't
want
to
give
the
impression...
i
guess
i
did...
that
i
agree
that
constitutionally
you
can
just
control
noise.
all
i
am
saying
essentially
that
you
can
create
situations
where
you
have
ordinances
against...
i
think
in
the
kovacs
case
it
said
loud
and
raucous
noise
in
sound
trucks.
and
i
think
this
court
has
held
a
number
of
times
that
that
can
be
controlled,
not
by
a
man
at
the
console,
but
by
ordinances
and
criminal
actions.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
yes.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
no,
not
by...
run
by
the
state.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
it's
automatic.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
that's
right.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
well,
i'm
not...
it's
not
unconstitutional
because
no
state
official
runs
it.
this
is
something
the
band
would
do
voluntarily.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
no,
that
wasn't
my
point,
that
they
would
insist
upon
it.
they
would
set
the
decibel
limit,
and
then
the
band,
in
order
to
control
itself
and
keep
under...
from
coming
under
the
criminal
statutes,
could
use
the
limiter
or
the
governor
on
the
band.
i
wasn't
suggesting
the
state
could
do
it
at
all.
and
i'm
not
even
suggesting,
justice
white,
it's
the
best
thing
for
artistic
music.
i
think
the
best
thing
is
to
negotiate
decibel
lengths...
or
limits
the
way
the
parks
department
does...
national
park
service...
and
then
enforce
the
law.
they've
never
enforced
the
law
here.
they've
never
even
negotiated
the
limits
even
though
they
say
in
their
brief
that
they
do.
you
won't
find
it
in
the
record.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i
don't
think
anything
is
wrong
with
it.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
they
can
make
the
rule.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
and
the
normal
thing...
national
park
service
has
made
the
rule
that
we
will
establish
a
decibel
level.
and
they
say
they
have
1,500
events
a
year
where
sound
amplification
is
used.
we
will
reach
a
decibel
level
with
you
and
you
stay
under
it,
within
it.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i
think
that's
the
least
intrusive.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
no,
i
don't
remember
any
testimony
about
decibel
level
being
feasible
for
rock
music
or
unfeasible
or
nonfeasible
for
rock
music.
but
i
notice
in
the
park
service
regulations
and
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief
that
they
have
rock
concerts
at
national
parks,
many
of
them,
and
that
they
establish
a
decibel
level.
they
monitor
it
through
a...
an
expert
or
a
ranger
or
what
have
you,
and
they
have
all
those
alternatives.
they
use
the
word
"ironically"
about
what
could
happen
here,
and
i
think
it
is
ironic
that
they're
attempting
really
to
become
part
of
the
band,
to
have
a
state
official
as
part
of
the
band.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
we
don't
know.
i
don't
think
there
was
any
testimony
that
i
recall
about--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--monitoring
it.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
well--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--no,
but
the
park
service
says
that
they
do
it.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
it's
hard
to
post
someone
at
the
sheep
meadow
who
has
ears
and
can
hear
if
it's
bleeding
in.
in
fact,
you
will
find
in
the
record
here,
in
the
preliminary
record,
there
was
a
man
named
mr.
schulman
who
was
their
expert
during
the
preliminary
injunction
hearings
who
said
he
stood
at
central
park
west
and
here's
his
testimony.
he
said
he
had
a
man
standing
there.
he
could
hardly
hear
it.
that's
on
page
449
of
the
first...
the
joint
appendix,
volume
ii
of
the
joint
appendix.
they
can
monitor
that
easily
enough.
that's
just
as
much
as
a
policeman
standing
outside
your
dorm
who
here's
it
bleed
into
other
parts
of
the
college.
i
assume
this
was
in
college,
but
i
won't
press
you
on
it.
[laughter]
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
but
the
point
is
it's
easy
to
have
someone
stand
at
the
sheep
meadow.
that
has
been
designated
since
this
all
began
as
a
quiet
zone
by
mayor
koch.
to
have
someone
stand
there.
if
it's
getting
into
the
sheep
meadow,
then
you
don't
even
have
to
care
about
decibels.
it's
going
too
far.
but
you
can
negotiate.
they
can
negotiate
decibel
limits.
and
i
agree;
different
instruments
are
different.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
xxx.
but
you
don't
find
flutes
in
a
rock
band.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
and
weather
conditions,
wind
conditions--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--on
a
particular
day.
so,
just
negotiating
a
decibel
limit
is
not
by
itself
enough,
because
you
can...
i
think
justice
stevens
correctly
says
that
wind
has
a
big
factor.
the
humidity
has
a
factor.
everything
plays
a
factor
as
alan
thompson
testified.
but
then
you
have
someone
stand
at
the
sheep
meadow
at
the
outskirts
or
on
central
park
west
or
central...
or
fifth
avenue.
if
it
gets
over
there,
it's
beyond...
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
decibel
limit
is,
it's
beyond
what
it
should
be.
then
they
go
and
report
to
the
band.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i'm
not
so
sure.
i've
heard
the
philharmonic
on
some--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--well,
when
those
kettle
drums
go,
it's
loud.
i
heard
it
at
the
abyssinian
baptist
church
when
the
philharmonic
came,
and
it
is
loud.
now,
it's
not
as
loud
ordinarily
as
a
close,
confined
club--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--where
you
have
a
rock
band.
[laughter]
what's
your
next
question?
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i
guess
that
would
be
it.
i've
heard
the
philharmonic,
but
the
philharmonic
works
in
a
much
bigger
auditorium
where
sound
is
dissipated,
like
carnegie
hall.
a
rock
band
usually
plays
in
the
bitter
end
or
in
a
small
room
where
you
have
close
confinement,
and
they
do
love
it
loud.
no
question
about
it.
my
daughter...
well,
i
won't
go
into
that.
[laughter]
in
any
event,
i
think
they...
what
they've
done
here...
i
think...
i
don't
think
this
is
just
time,
place
and
manner.
i
think
this
is
a
pure
first
amendment
freedom
of
expression
case.
they
want
to
put
georg
solti
in
for
zubin
mehta,
essentially,
even
though
this
is
a
different
type
band
and
say
everybody
loves
georg
solti.
he's
a
city
employee.
we
all
love
him.
many
have
heard
him,
and
therefore
he's
the
man
that's
going
to
do
it.
and,
zubin
mehta,
you
stay
out
of
the
park
because
that's
really
what
they're
saying.
the
sound
mix
man...
despite
what
justice
kennedy
tells
me
is
not
in
the
record,
the
sound
mix
man
in
the
record
is
classified
as
part
of
the
band
as
the
esthetic
creator.
and
in
fact,
you'll
find
in
their
own
brief
they
talk
about
the
city,
and
the
petitioner's
brief
talks
about
the
fact
that
there
is
a...
an
esthetic
balance
that
the
mixer
does.
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
there's
one
very
interesting
statement,
which
occurs
on
page
15.
the
solicitor
general
says,
"here
it
could
be
said
that
the
city's
sound
amplification
guideline
prohibits
outright
those
aspects
of
artistic
expression
which
are
inherent
in
the
selection
and
direct
control
of
the
bandshell's
sound
system.
"
"there's
the
solicitor
general's
brief
that
they
say
are
in...
prohibit
outright
those
aspects
of
artistic
expression.
"
and
that's
what
we
have
here.
it's
a
sul
generis
case
where
the
state
is
trying
to
essentially
mix
the
sound
of
the
band,
a
state
employee
using
state-hired
equipment.
and
the
fact
that
that
man
may
satisfy
others,
that
new
york
sound
may
satisfy
others...
others
like
it,
does
not
mount
to
a
hill
of
beans
here.
it's
not
what
satisfies
others;
it's
what
satisfies
the
rar
and
the
bands
which
it
employs.
in
fact,
on
page
16
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
they
recognize
the
"esthetic
balancing"
of
new
york
sound,
and
that
new
york
sound
showed
"remarkable
sensitivity
to
that
problem".
well,
that
problem
is
what
you
have
in
this
case,
the
problem
of
whether
the
state
is
going
to
mix
the
sound,
under
the
first
amendment,
of
rock
bands
and
that
that
satisfies
the
first
amendment.
i
don't
think
it
does,
and
i
don't
think
any
of
your
cases
really
have
met
this
problem
as
to
superimposing
a
state
official
to
manipulate
and
to
run
esthetic
balancing
of
rock
bands.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
you
can't
do
that,
justice
white,
because
there
are
some
times--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--remember
the
court's
first
finding
was
just
the
opposite
when
it
issued
the
preliminary
injunction.
it
changed
during
the
hearing.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
well,
but
i
think
when
it
heard
the
words
"until
their
ears
bleed",
i
think
that
marked
the
change
in
judge
haight's
attitude
toward
this
case.
but
i...
if
you
read...
in
the
testimony--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--but
you
can't
do
it.
you
see
it
in
the
record.
you
can't
do
it
because
there
are
over
200
operations
in
a
single
minute
some
time
as
to
those
knobs.
you
know,
there
are
eight
times
22
knobs.
and
to
get
a
message
across
to
the
technician
that,
no,
that's
not
the
way
they
want
it--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--well,
i
don't
think
you're
under
the...
the
purely
erroneous
rule
here
of
national
gypsum.
i
know
that's
cited
by
the
adversary
here.
i
think
you've
got
a...
a
pure
first
amendment
situation
here.
the
judge
in
his
findings
did
not
dispute
the
fact
it
was
an
esthetic
mix,
and
that
the...
someone
sitting
next
to
the
sound
technician
cannot
do
the
trick.
alan
thompson
testified
that
you
cannot
do
the
trick.
you
have
to
do
it
yourself.
and
they
allow
five
minutes
a
band
here.
if
you
notice,
they
have
45
minutes
for,
i
think,
eight
or
nine
bands.
and
you
just
can't
even
get
the
drift
in
five
minutes
of
these
rock
bands,
which
are
very
sensitive.
this
is
all
electronic
music,
and
the
mix
is
crucial
to
it.
it's
more
crucial
to
it
than
with
the
philharmonic
which
doesn't
use...
thank
god...
electronic
equipment,
but
uses
the...
i
think
someone
said...
justice
stevens...
the
old-fashioned
instruments.
i
think
i've
spoke
my
piece
and
i
can't
think
of
anything
more
to
say.
unless
there
are
questions
from
the
court,
i
will
sit
me
down.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
thank
you,
justice
rehnquist.
