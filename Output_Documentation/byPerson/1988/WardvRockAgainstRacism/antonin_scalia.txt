justice
scalia
he
didn't
really
say
only.
i
meant
i...
i
think
he
was--
justice
scalia
you
basically
don't...
don't
believe
that
the
drummer
could
be
same,
could
be
exactly
the
same.
justice
scalia
whereas
you
do
believe
that
the
mixer
could
be
the
same.
justice
scalia
just
like
replacing
a
ballet
dancer,
use
our
ballet
dancer.
he'll
just
be
just
as
good.
you
don't
believe
he'll
be
just
as
good,
do
you?
justice
scalia
but
you
can
believe
that
a
mixer
might
be
just
as
good.
justice
scalia
mr.
koerner,
could
i
come
back
to
the
mix
again?
i...
i
guess
i
don't
understand
this.
i
had
thought
that...
that
you
can't
control
the
sound
level
without
controlling
the
mix,
that
if...
if
you
just
establish
a
single
sound
level...
some
instruments
carry
further
than
others
and,
therefore,
you
just
can't
set
it
at
a
certain
level
and
let
the
person
mix
the
various
instruments
any
way
he
wants.
if
you
mix
it
a
certain
way,
it's
going
to
carry
further
than
if
you
mix
it
another
way.
and
the
decibels
and
the...
and
the...
the
instruments'
relative
strength
are
interdependent.
is
that
right,
or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
scalia
is
that
feasible
when
you
have
a
crowd?
i...
i've
heard
riots
occurring
when
that
happens.
justice
scalia
you
have
a
lot
of
people
who
are
there
for
a
rock
concert,
and
the
police
come
in
and
pull
the
plug.
that's--
justice
scalia
--well,
yours...
yours
might
not
be.
some
of
the
other
events
there
may
be.
i...
i
don't
think
that's
a
very
happy
solution,
do
you?
justice
scalia
well,
fine.
sometimes
you're
lucky.
sometimes
you're
not.
justice
scalia
it
certainly
depends
upon
the
crowd,
doesn't
it?
justice
scalia
well,
i
don't
think
that's
a
very
feasible
one,
frankly.
i...
in
fact,
i
consider
that
more
extreme
than
what
was
done.
justice
scalia
what
do
you
do
when
they
violate
the
decibel
level?
pull
the
plug?
justice
scalia
i
thought
that
had
been
done
with
your
group.
although
there
wasn't
a
specified
decibel
level,
i
thought
there
was
indication
in
the
record
that
the
police
had
told
the
group
you
were
playing
too
loud.
and
they
said,
okay,
we'll
lower
it,
and
then
it
went
up
again.
and
then
the
police
came
back--
justice
scalia
--xxx
up
and
down.
justice
scalia
well,
what
difference
does
it
make
whether...
whether
they
tell
you're
too
loud,
and
you
say,
okay,
i'll
lower
it,
and
then
you
get
too
loud
again,
or
whether
they
say
you're
too
loud
because
you're
three
points
over
this
decibel
level?
justice
scalia
well,
are
you
contesting
the...
the
accuracy
of
the
evidence
that
they
got
louder
again
when
the
police
left?
justice
scalia
well,
i
don't
know
how
much
louder
they
got,
but
i
know
they
got
louder
than
they
had
agreed
to
reduce
it
to.
justice
scalia
well,
i
don't
know.
mr.
kunstler,
you
know,
when
i
was
a
young
man,
occasionally
i
had
been
at
parties
that
got
a
little
loud.
and...
and
an
officer
would
come
by--
justice
scalia
--an
officer
would
come
by.
he
would
not
have
a
decibel
meter.
he'd
say
the
party
is
too
loud.
[laughter]
and
i
have
heard
that
on
some
occasions,
and
not
at
parties
i
was
at,
it
would
get
loud
again.
and
the
officer
would
come
back
without
a
decibel
meter.
i
mean,
i--
justice
scalia
--this
is
just
unrealistic.
justice
scalia
no
matter
what
instruments
you're
using?
i
mean,
if
you're
using,
you
know,
a
bank
of
flutes
all
at
110
decibels,
it's
the
same
as
if
you're
using--
justice
scalia
--clarinets?
justice
scalia
and...
and--
justice
scalia
mr.
kunstler,
they
say
monitor
the
decibel
level.
do
we
know
where
they
monitor
it?
is
it
on
the
sheep
meadow
or
where
the...
where
the
music
originates?
justice
scalia
well,
i...
i
keep
coming
back--
justice
scalia
--to
the
fact,
i
am...
i
am
not
sure
that
you
can
just
set
one
decibel
level
and
that
every
mix
of
music
that
you
get
is
going
to
carry
the
same
distance
so
long
as
it
is
only
at
that
decibel
level.
justice
scalia
i...
do
we
know
from
the
record
whether...
whether
that's
the
case?
justice
scalia
well,
that's
pretty
important
because
if
how
far
it
carries
depends
not
just
upon
the
decibel
level,
but
also
upon
what
instruments
are
being
played
and
what
the
mix
of
those
instruments
is,
then
all
of
your
solutions
regarding
decibel
level
at
the
source
are
simply
not
solutions
at
all.
justice
scalia
i
made
it
up,
mr.
kunstler.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
that
was
the
1812,
mr.
kunstler,
you
were
talking--
[laughter]
