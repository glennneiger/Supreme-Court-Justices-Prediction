mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
opinion
of
the
second
circuit
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
flawed
in
two
respects.
it
ignored
the
history
leading
up
to
the
sound
amplification
guideline,
along
with
the
district
court
findings,
most
of
which
were
based
on
uncontradicted
evidence;
and
it
applied
the
least
restrictive
alternative
to
suggest
a
hypothetical
solution
which
had
not
been
urged
by
either
side
up
to
the
point
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals'
decision.
the
bandshell,
which
is
the
subject
of
the
sound
amplification
guideline,
is
located
in
the
heart
of
central
park.
it's
surrounded
by
two
major
roads,
central
park
west
and
fifth
avenue.
in
both
areas,
it's
heavily
residential.
in
addition,
to
the
southwest
of
the
bandshell
within
150
yards,
is
the
sheep
meadow
which
was
designated
by
the
mayor
as
a
quiet...
a
place
for
repose.
individuals
who
go
there
cannot
use
radios.
they
can
only
sit,
read,
et
cetera.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
nineteen
eighty-five,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
yes,
that
is
correct.
between
1979
and
1986--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--yes,
your
honor.
between
1979
and
1986,
rock
against
racism
conducted
concerts
in
the
bandshell.
during
this
period,
there
was
a
great
deal
of
arguments
between
the
city
and
the...
and
the
rar
concerning
the
loudness.
the
following
occurred
during
the...
during
this
period.
in
1983
the
police
attempted
to
lower
the
sound
at
the
mixing
board,
and
as
a
consequence,
the
sponsor
got
up
and
told
the
audience
that
the
police
were
trying
to
lower
the
sound
and
it
caused
a
confrontation.
there
was
some
tension,
and
eventually
the
sound
was
lowered,
and
then
it
went
back
up.
this
was
the
pattern
each
year.
there
would
be
the
interaction
between
the
park
officials
and
the
promoter
resulting
in
this
tension
each
time.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
there
was
a
general
guideline
for
all
parks
that
prohibited
excessive
sound.
and,
indeed,
summonses
could
be
issued
for
that
guideline
and
summonses
were
issued
in
this
case
during
some
of
the
years,
but
the
summonses
were
not
paid.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
that's
correct.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
basically
they--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--the
record
does
not
show
why.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
because
we...
as
i
understand
it,
we...
they
just
went
unpaid.
the
city
tried
to
enforce
them,
but
this
is
a
not-for-profit
group
that
shows
up
once
a
year.
as
a
practical
matter,
it
just
wasn't
enforced.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
yes,
that
could
be
an
alternative.
but,
frankly,
we
would
just
be
in
litigation
each
year
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
nature
of
the
violation
was
such--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--yes,
we
don't
deny
that
there
could
have
been
other
alternatives.
but
this
one
was
tried
without
success.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
no.
there
were
two
other...
there
were
two
other...
it
was
one
of
the
reasons.
the
bleeding
out
of
sound
into
the
sheep
meadow
areas
and
in
the
residence
was
one
of
the
grounds.
the
two
other
reasons
were
that
they
wanted
to
unify
the
system
of
permits.
the
bandshell
is
the
most
frequently
used
place
in
central
park.
and
as
a
result,
it
was
a
very
diffuse
process
where
the
applications
had
to
be
made
to
many
different
entitles,
and
they
wanted
to
centralize
it
in
one
person.
the
second
thing
is
that
many
of
the
groups
who
come
to
the
bandshell
are
unfamiliar
with
outdoor
concerts.
as
a
consequence
they
come
with
machines
that
are
under-powered
and
many
people
don't
even
nave
the
machines,
and
want
to
know
what
the
source
would
be
to
rent
such
machines.
so,
the
second
purpose
was
to
assure
every
group
that
participated
in
the
bandshell
that
they
would
have
the
high-quality
mechanics
that
would
allow
then
to
sponsor
their
broadcast.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
precisely,
your
honor,
indeed,
if
i
can
answer
that
in
some
depth.
that
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
issue.
the
testimony
at
trial
was
precisely
that.
the
city-hired
sound
consultant,
gary
floyd,
has
asked
that
both
on
direct
and
cross-examination.
what
he
pointed
out
is
that
when
you
reflect
the
mix,
you
do
it
based
on
your
technical
knowledge
and
the
knowledge
that
you
obtain
by
talking
to
the
performers,
that
this
happens
all
the
time.
and
that
by
doing
sound
checks
in
advance,
sending
out
technical
information
to
each
of
the
performers
and,
in
addition,
by
talking
to
them
on
the
phone
in
advance
of
the
concert
and
allowing
the
performer,
if
he
desires,
to
set
someone
down
next
to
you
to
give
you
the
technical
advice,
you
can
reflect
exactly
what
the
mix
is
supposed
to
be.
indeed,
that's
precisely
what
the
district
court
found.
and
when
alan
thompson,
who
was
the
technician
for
ra,
testified,
he
pointed
out
precisely
that's
the
method
he
used.
two
things
i
would
like
to
elaborate
on
in
response
to
your
question.
first,
one
year
they
didn't
even
use
alan
thompson.
they
rented
out
the
equipment.
so,
they
used
precisely
the
same
type
of
program
that
we
used.
the
person
came
on,
and
he
reflected
the
mix
through
the
same
process
i
just
described.
in
addition,
alan
thompson
rented
his
equipment,
and
so...
just
as
we
rent
our
equipment.
so,
it
was
very
similar.
and
finally--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--that
is
correct.
the
sound
technician
is
merely
a
mechanic,
and
he
can
reflect,
as
the
testimony
shows,
within
five
minutes
precisely
what
the
performer
wants.
when
alan
thompson,
rar's
technician,
was
asked
how
he
achieves
the
mix,
he
said
exactly
what
gary
floyd
said.
he
speaks
to
the
performer,
he
does
a
sound
check
at
the
beginning
of
the
concert,
and
finally
he
allows
the
performers
to
have
a
technician
at
his
side
in
order
to
reflect
the
concert.
so,
that's
precisely
right.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
not
only
does
the
testimony
confirm
that,
but
the
district
court
on
two
occasions
reviewed
that
testimony.
the
first
time
it
specifically
noted
that
the
technician
defers
to
the
sponsor
as
to
the
mix.
and
then
rar
made
a
motion
to
clarify
the
order
to
determine
who
was
to
control
the
mixing
board.
in
response
to
that
motion,
the
district
court
judge
issued
a
second
opinion
in
which
he
said
as
far
as
the
regulation
is
concerned,
the
city
is
required...
he
read
into
the
regulation
a
requirement
that
they
defer
to
the
sponsor
on
the
mix.
and
then
he
pointedly
noted
that
there
had
been
no
evidence
to
indicate
that
the
city
could
not
reflect
the
mix
properly.
and
in
addition,
there
had
been
evidence
to
indicate
that
the
city
could
reflect.
and
that
was
the
overwhelming
testimony.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
because
it's
the
only
way
to
also
control
the
sound
to
make
sure
that
the
bleeding
doesn't
occur
to
the--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--yes.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
yes,
because
when
the
sound
consultant
was
given
the
job
of
considering
alternatives,
they
considered,
one,
just
having
the
city
technician,
but
having
the
sponsor's
equipment.
but
then
the
mix
would
have
suffered
because
a
technician
is
only
as
good
as
familiarity
with
his
equipment.
if
he
is
not
familiar
with
the
equipment,
he
can't
do
the
job.
so,
that
was
rejected.
the
other
thing
they
thought
about
was
negotiating
a
decibel
level.
but
they
had
tried
that
in
1984,
indeed
at
the
suggestion
of
rar,
and
rar,
on
the
eve
of
a
concert,
did
not
agree
to
it
and
said
that
no
decibel
level
would
be
appropriate.
indeed,
consistent
with
that,
in
the
testimony
by
alan
thompson,
rar's
chief
witness,
when
he
was
asked
at
what
level
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
city
to
interfere
with
the
concert,
he
said
only
when
the
audience's
ears
bleed,
which
gives
you
an
idea
of
their
reaction
to
any
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
city
to
protect
the
unwilling
listeners
in
the
sheep
meadow.
also--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--or
painfully
loud,
he
said.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
and
the...
the
volume
levels
are
right
on
the
mixing
board.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
that
is
a
possibility,
your
honor,
but
the
problem
is
it
causes
the
same
interaction
between
the
sponsor's
technician
and
the
city's
technician
that
creates
the
same
confrontational
atmosphere
that
the
city
had
in
1983
when
it
tried
to
use
the
police
to
lower
the
sound.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
yes.
that
is--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--that...
that
is
a
possibility,
but
by
having
the
city
technician
alongside
with
the
sponsor's
technician,
you
have
the
same
type
of
atmosphere
that
we
were
trying
to
avoid,
which
is
this
interaction
which
never
worked.
in
addition,
while
each
of
these
methods
may
be
plausible,
we
believe
that
under
that
appropriate
tests,
which
i
will
discuss
in
a
little
while...
that
not
the
test.
the
least
restrictive
alternative
has
never
been
a
test
of
this
court.
and
the
question
is
whether
the
city's
method
has
been
effective.
and
i
would
like
to
deal
with
that
before
we
get,
to
the
law.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
that's
correct.
although
i...
what
the
record
does
show
is
that
the
technician,
when
he
works
both,
he
works
them...
it's
done
immediately.
so,
these...
these
knobs
are
constantly
being
put
up
and
down.
but
you
are
quite
correct.
there's
nothing
directly
on
point
in
that.
i
do
want
to
point
out
that
in
1986,
50
to
60
concerts
were
held
under
this
sound
amplification
guideline.
in
terms
of
whether
the
city
could
protect
the
mix
of
the
sponsor,
every
group
was
satisfied,
some
of
whom
used
the
new
york
sound
group
that
was
designated
as
sponsor
for
outdoor
concerts.
so,
not
only
do
we
have
a
history
and
we
have
an
expert
that
had
been
retained,
but
we
have
an
in-fact
use
of
this
system,
and
every
group
reflected
the
mix...
said
that
the
mix
had
been
reflected
properly.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
no.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
because
in
that
particular
case--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--and
the
drummer
is
bleeding
outside?
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
then
i...
then,
yes,
we
could
control
the
excessive
sound
if--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--no,
by
controlling
the
sound--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--no,
because
i
think
there--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--you
would
be
substituting
your
judgment
for
that
as
the
esthetic,
the
drummer
himself.
but
we're
not
doing
that.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
well,
but
that
comes
close--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--i
agree,
and
that's
a
tougher
case
and
it
comes
closer
to
substituting
your
judgment
for
that
as
the...
the
musical--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--but
a
different
performer
takes
away
from
the
in
effect,
the
quality
of
the
performance.
i
can
see--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--i
guess--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--but
i
think
the
mixer
is
different
in
that--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--because
with
respect
to
the
drummer,
you're
replacing
the
instrument
itself.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
and
maybe
in
that--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--maybe
in
that
case,
it
would
be
unreasonable
because
the
city
would
then
be
imposing
it
and
substituting
its
choice
for
that
of
the
actual
instrument.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
i
understand
where
that's
a
more
egregious
situation,
but
i
don't
think
that's
what
you
have
here.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
here
we...
we
did
exactly--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--that's
right.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
that's
right.
and
if
i
may
give
an
example,
justice
stevens.
if
this
individual
was
using
an
auditorium
that
had
a
built-in
loudspeaker
system,
i
suppose
one
could
argue
that
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
loudspeaker
system,
it's
affecting
the
quality
of
his
performance.
but
at
some
point
you
have
to
draw
the
line.
and
with
the
mix
and
the
loudspeaker
system,
the
evidence
shows
that
we
can
precisely
reflect
what
the
performer
wants,
whereas
your
example
is
a
little
more
extreme,
and,
indeed,
that's
exactly
what
the
district
court
found.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
no.
but
the
issue...
the
issue
is
not
whether
the
rock
music--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--yes.
but
the
issue--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--that's
correct.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
but
the
supreme...
this
court
help
in
kovacs
v.
cooper
that
you
could
establish
standards
for
excessive
sound
and--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--yes.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
no.
and
we
don't
pretend
to
regulate
the
speech
within
the
bandshell
area.
all
we
do
is
control
loudness
to
the
extent
it
doesn't
bleed
into
the
unwilling
listener
area.
and,
indeed,
as
i
keep
pointing
out--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--i
don't
mean
to
belabor
it,
but
i
believe
it's
significant
that
of
all
the
other
groups...
and
there
was
folk,
reggae,
other
rock
concerts...
every
person
was
satisfied
with
the
way
the
city-designated
technician
made
the
mix.
and
interestingly
enough,
during
the
same
year
that
rar
received
a
dispensation
from
using
this
system
because
it
obtained
injunctive
relief,
the
department
of
environmental
protection
for
the
city
reviewer
the
sound
levels
at
the
concert.
rar
was
by
far
the
highest
and
they
generated
complaints,
whereas
all
the
other
groups
used
this
mix
to
their
satisfaction.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
yes.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
i--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--and
he
would
have
controlled
the
sound?
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
so
that
it
wouldn't
bleed
into
other
areas?
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
and
he
wouldn't
substitute
his
judgement
for
that
of
one
group?
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
yes,
i
believe
that's
a
method
that
may
have
been
appropriate
under
your
court's
test.
this
court
has
dealt
with
the
appropriate
standard
with
reviewing
time,
place
and
manner.
time,
place
and
manner
presumes
that
there's
going
to
be
some
limitation
on
free
speech,
but
it
recognizes
that
where
there's
a
significant
governmental
interest,
that
the
government
has
a
right
to
make
this
limitation.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
to
the
unwanted
areas.
that's
correct.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
it's
the
most
appropriate
way
to
control
the
sound.
that's
correct.
and
since
mechanically
the
mix
is
not
changed,
and
we
have
control
over
the
sound,
yes.
and
if
you
look
at
heffron
and
albertini
and
the
clark
case,
in
each
case
alternative
suggestions
were
made
which
were
less
extreme
than
the
one
the
government
had
chosen
in
terms
of
regulating
the
constitutional
right.
but
this--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--but...
it...
that's
what...
i
would
respond
it
does
because
we
believe
it's
the
only
effective
way
of
controlling
the
sound
because
to
have
two
people
side
by
side
creates
the
same
confrontational
problem
that
we
had
before
when
the
police
tried
to
control
the
sound,
as
did
the
other
park
rangers,
between
1983
and
1986.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
because
as
a
practical
matter,
whenever
you
have
a...
a
group
that
doesn't
recognize
sound
limits,
and
you
have
a
large
audience
there,
and
you
have
the
city
there,
some
things
happen
in
the
heat
of
battle
that
don't
follow
a
normal,
orderly
plan.
indeed,
the
second
circuit
recognized
that
when
they
themselves
had
trouble
with
their
own
suggestions
because
they
recognized
it
dealt
with...
it
depended
upon
negotiation
and
agreement,
ability
to
get
along.
sc,
they
said
as
a
last
resort,
pull
the
plug.
well,
pulling
the
plug
penalizes
the
listeners
who
have
come
to
the
concert.
it's
the
most
confrontational.
yet,
the
circuit
thought
it
was
the
least
restrictive.
and,
indeed,
the
district
court
in
discussing
that
aspect
found
it
to
be
the
most
restrictive
because
it
stops
the
concert.
it
is
not
our
position
that
there
aren't
alternatives.
but
each
alternative
is
fraught
with
difficulty.
any
attempt
to
negotiate,
which
we
had
tried
between
1983
and
1987
failed,
and--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--the
record
is...
is
a
little
unclear.
what
the
record
shows,
though,
is
that
the
mixer
operates
all
of
these
in
tandem.
and,
indeed,
joseph
killian
pointed
out
to
support
your
conclusion,
that
many
times
concert
promoters
who
are
unfamiliar
with
outdoor
concerts
will
use
loudness
to
overcome
the
mixing
problem
so
that
they
will
make
it
loud
as
if
that
was
the
solution
to
properly
reflecting
the
instruments.
basically
what
the
testimony
is
is
that
it's
all
on
one
board,
and
one
person
moves
all
the
handles
in
a
synchronized
fashion.
so,
whether
it
is
possible
to
have
two
people
sit
side
by
side
is
unclear
from
the
record.
what
is
not
possible
is
to
have
a
volume
control
separate
and
discrete
from
the
mixing
board.
that
presents
more
problems
than
it
resolves.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
yes,
that
is
correct.
and,
indeed,
that's
what
alan--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--absolutely,
and
the
district
court
so
found,
and
the
circuit
court
upheld
that
particular
portion.
basically
this
was
a
solution
after
much
consideration
by
the
special
projects
director
and
the
sound
consultant
expert.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
all
the
other
methods
that
were
selected
with
the
exception
of
pulling
the
plug
depended
on
the
cooperation
of
each
group.
and,
frankly,
with
respect
to
this
particular
group,
the
cooperation
had
been
less
than
the
optimum
during
the
preceding
history.
so,
what
the
city
wanted
to
do...
and
they
had
two
goals...
was
to
have
a
program
that
would
reflect
the
sponsor's
views
and
at
the
same
time
assure
uniform
high
quality.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
what
happens
is
mr.
killian,
who's
a
special
events
director...
he
attends
every
concert.
and
he
will
go
around
the
periphery
of
the
bandshell
and
see
whether
or
not
the
sound
is
bleeding
into
those
areas.
he
then
will
take
the
sponsor
back
there
and
tell
the
sponsor
that
it's
too
loud.
and
they
then
will
concur.
during
1986
there
wasn't
one
problem
for
50
to
60
events.
the
only
problem
was
the
one
with
rar
where
they
had
a
dispensation
because
they
had
injunctive
relief
that
allowed
them
to
use
their
own
concert
mix.
with
respect
to
the
applicable
case
law,
heffron,
albertini
and
clark,
the
test
as
we
see
to
extrapolate
from
those
cases
is
not
whether
or
not
the
particular
solution
is
the
best,
but
whether
or
not
it
is
effective.
or
does
it
serve
the
governmental
interest
in
a
substantial
way?
in
this
case
the
record
shows
that
what
we
did
was
effective.
every
group
was
satisfied
that
used
it.
it
shows
that
we
controlled
sound.
there
were
no
more
complaints
from
the
residential
areas
or
the
sheep
meadow.
and
we
preserved
the
interests
of
the
unwilling
listeners
and
we
also
preserved
the
sponsor's
artistic
integrity.
that
is
precisely
what
time,
place
and
manner
is
supposed
to
do.
and
for
all
those
reasons,
we
ask
that
the
sound
amplification
guideline
be
upheld.
i
have
not
used
all
my
time.
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice,
reserve
some
of
it
for
reply
if
necessary.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
one
of
the
problems
with
this
case
is
that
the
respondent
has
just
carried
his
burden
of
going
forward
which
he
didn't
do
at
the
trial
court.
a
lot
of
statements
he
made
do
not...
are
not
reflected
in
the
record.
first,
with
respect
to
a
decibel
level,
he
indicated
we
never
tried
to
negotiate
a
level.
that
is
inaccurate.
at
page
343
and
384,
it
says
quite
clearly
that
in
1984
we
suggested
a
decibel
level,
which
was
precipitated
by
their
inquiry
as
to
whether
or
not
we
should
have
one.
and
when
we
agreed
to
try
it
as
a
test,
they
didn't
show
up
to
try
to
revise
it,
and
then
took
the
position
that
any
decibel
level
would
violate
their
constitutional
rights.
so,
we
tried
that
alternative,
and
it
was
because
of
their
stubbornness,
not
ours,
that
it
wasn't
given
a
fair
test.
second,
with
respect
to
the
mix
itself,
gary
floyd,
our
sound
consultant,
did
not
say
that
the
mix
is
part
of
the
band.
at
180
to
181,
what
he
specifically
said
was
a
good
mixer
can
reflect
the
band's
artistic
inclinations
within
five
minutes.
second,
alan
thompson,
the
plaintiff's
own
witness...
i
would
like
to
just
read
this.
it
will
only
take
a
second,
but
it
summarizes
our
case
because
he
did
not
disagree.
in
asking
to
describe
how
he
mixes
at
the
board,
he
said
specific--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--at
the
bottom
of
page
100
to
the
top
of
101
of
the
joint
appendix.
"yes,
i
am
at
the
board,
and
basically
during
the
performance
i
am
part
of
the
band,
because
i
am
balancing
all
of
their
instruments
together
to
sound
right
to
their
taste.
"
"how
do
you
know
what
their
taste
is?
"
"they
have
their
manager
and
their
own
sound
mixer
present
at
my
elbow.
"
"or
they
tell
me
what
they
want
previously.
"
and
he
goes
on.
that's
precisely
what
we
do.
and
that
is
why
the
district
court
confirmed
that
we
could
reflect
the
mix.
with
respect
to
the
sound
itself
as
to
why
we
didn't
set
a
decibel
level,
that
was
one
of
the
options
considered
by
our
consultant.
but
the
reason
he
didn't
set
a
general
decibel
level
is
because
it
varies
based
on
foliage,
temperature
and
crowds.
and,
therefore,
a
decibel
level
for
each...
for
each
event
would
not
be
appropriate
and
it
may
not
even
be
appropriate
for
the
very
event
you
set
ore
because
the
crowds
keep
forming.
as
the
crowds
get
larger,
the
decibel
level
would
have
to
be
changed.
and,
therefore,
there
would
be
no
objective
standard
they
could
count
on.
finally,
with
respect
to
the
separate
volume
control,
which
has
now
come
up
as
a
suggestion
because
it
was
mentioned
by
the
second
circuit,
that
was
never
mentioned
up
to
the
point
of
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit.
no
one
ever
suggested
a
separate
volume
control.
and,
in
fact,
such
a
control
would
cause
more
problems
than
it
would
solve
because
a
control
such
as
that
would
have
to
be
hooked
into
each
mixer
that
was
brought
to
the
many
concerts
held
at
the
bandshell.
as
a
consequence,
those
mixers
would
have
to
be
compatible.
to
the
extent
that
the
mixers
are
not
compatible,
we
would
not
be
able
to
offer
the
event.
second,
if
you
did
have
a
separate
volume
control,
far
and
away
from
the
mixer,
basically
what
you
could
have
is
competing
controls.
each
time
we
lowered
the
sound,
an
individual
at
the
mixing
board
would
be
able
to
manipulate
his
portion
through
the
amplifiers
and
nullify
the
competing
controls.
finally,
in
addition,
by
having
a
separate
volume
control,
it
would
cause
a
signal
loss
in
the
mixer
and
could
upset
the
balance
of
the
mix.
so,
frankly,
that
particular
solution
would
actually
affect
the
esthetics,
and
it
would...
should
be
the
least
desirable.
and
that
is
why
the
city
chose
the
method
it
did
and
why
it
was
accepted
by
every
person
that
used
it
for...
in
the
year
1986.
thank
you.
