before
you
even
get
into
that,
the,
the...
the
appellee
has
raised
an
argument
in,
in
reply
to
the
government's
second
brief.
if
i
understand
it
correctly
it's
that
this
is
res
judicata,
and
that
we
really
don't
have
to
get
into
what,
what
the
law
meant
after
mccarty
or
after
the
statute
in
response
to
mccarty
was
enacted,
that
the
california
courts
have
passed
on
it
before
mccarty
was
decided,
and
the,
the
matter's
closed.
is,
is
this
the
first
time
that
argument's
been
raised?
it
wasn't
in
the
principal
brief--
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
advantage
of
taking
it
in
disability
benefits
instead
of
taking
it
in
retirement
pay?
is
there--
justice
antonin
scalia
--apart
from
avoiding
state...
state
support
payments,
that's
all--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
excuse
me,
i
think
the
explanation
may
well
be
that
it
was
put
in
terms
of
an...
in
terms
of
an
election
to
solve
the
problem
of
people
who
already
had
some
retirement
benefits
at
the
time
the
law
was
passed.
so,
you,
you...
that
is,
they'd
already
earned
it,
so
you
say,
well,
we
don't
want
you
to
be
double-dippers.
we
don't
want
to
give
you
retirement
benefits
plus
disability
benefits.
instead
of
just
passing
a
law
saying,
we're
going
to
cancel
your
retirement
benefits,
we
will
phrase
it
as
a
waiver,
in
order
to
get
the
retirement
benefits,
or
the
disability
benefits,
you
have
to
waive.
it
seems
to
me
that
would
make
a
lot
of
sense.
congress--
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
that
would
happen
if
there
were
no
waiver
provision
here,
if
congress
simply
gave
somebody
a
disability,
or
the,
the
military
person
who's
injured
the
first
day
on
the
job.
he
would
waive
nothing.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
law
would
be
clear
that
california
couldn't
get
the
rest
of
his
estate,
in,
in,
in...
just
set
off
the
disability
benefits
against
the
rest
of
his
estate.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's,
it's
not
an
absurd
situation
that,
that
you're
painting
that
someone
who
has
disability
benefits
should
have
the
guaranteed
cushion
that
california
allows,
plus
his
disability
benefits.
that
would
normally
be
the
case,
if,
if,
if
he
hadn't
waived
something
in
order
to
get
the
disability
benefits.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
didn't...
why
didn't
we
reject
that
in
wissner?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they
only
eliminated
other
federal
wealth.
i
think
it's
a
double
dipping
provision,
rather
than
saying
we're
not
going
to
give
you
disability
benefits
if
you
have
other
wealth.
there's,
there's
no
means
test
for
the
disability
benefits.
you're
entitled
to
them
even
if
you're
a
millionaire,
aren't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
any
case,
that's
a
state
law
question.
why
should
we
decide
the
state
law
question
of
whether
this
is
res
judicata
or
not?
why
can't
we
just
decide
the
federal
law
question
and,
as
you
say,
if
it
is
res
judicata,
the
california
court
will
say
so,
when
it's
sent
back.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
cornell,
you're,
you're
obviously
quite
right
that
you'll
have
different
results
in
two
different
estates
where
the
assets
are
the
same.
but
the,
the
issue
is
whether
there
was
not
intended
to
be
two
different
results.
what
is
your
explanation
for
the
fact
that
in
the
definition
of
disposable
retired
or
retainer
pay,
congress
specifies...
specifically
excludes
amounts
that
are
required
by
law
to
be
and
are
deducted
from
the
retired
or
retainer
pay?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
amounts
waived?
why
did
congress
make
that
exception?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
saying
he
doesn't
receive
it.
you're
saying
that
they'll
be
taken
away
from
him
just
the
way
retirement
pay
would
have
been
taken
away
from
him?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
long
as
he
has
other
assets.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
long
as
he
has
other
assets.
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
you
acknowledge
that
that
would
be
the
case
with
pure
retirement
pay,
with
pure
disability
pay.
if
he
hadn't
waived
anything,
that
would
be
precisely
the
result,
wouldn't
it?
you
wouldn't
say,
well,
he's
converted
the,
the,
the
disability
pay
into
other
assets
and
i
can
get
the
other
assets.
you'd
say
no,
despite
the
fact
that
he
has
other
assets
he's
entitled
to
keep
that
disability
pay.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
all
talks
about
retirement
pay
and
none
of
it
talks
about
disability
pay.
justice
antonin
scalia
read
mccarthy,
or
mccarty...
i
took
mccarty
to
be
an
elimination
of
the
distinction
between
garnishment
and
whether
you
can
get...
whether
you
can
get,
and,
and
i
didn't
agree
with
that
in
particular.
but
it
seems
to
me,
all
of
your
descriptions
have
been
talking
about
what
the
federal
government
allowed
to
be
garnished
under
the
new
statute.
but
the
fact
is,
by
reason
of
mccarty,
what
can't
be
garnished
can't
be
divided
either.
wasn't
that...
wasn't
that
the
lesson
of
mccarty?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
wasn't
congress
proceeding
on
the
basis
that
that
was
the
lesson
of
mccarty?
justice
antonin
scalia
--they
didn't
say
that
in
the
statute.
all
they
did
was
change
the
rules
about
garnishment.
and
to
the
extent
they
changed
the
rules
about
garnishment,
they
also
changed
the
rule
about
division.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree
with
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
disposable
retirement
pay,
which...
which
is
carefully
defined
to
exclude
any
amounts
that
have
been
waived.
justice
antonin
scalia
xxx
statute
as
just
a
garnishment
statute.
what
we
said
in
mccarty
is
that
to
prohibit
garnishment
is
to
prohibit
division.
and
now
you
want
us
to,
having
adopted
that
in
mccarty,
and
the
congress
was
well
aware
that
that's
what
we
did,
you
say
that
they
didn't
foresee
that
when
they
enacted
this
statute
we
would
say,
what
you
can't
garnish
you
can't
get?
i
would
think
that
that's
what
they
would
have...
would
have
expected
us
to
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
of
his
disability?
