well,
california
law
controls
that,
i
assume.
does
california
say
it's
not
a
property
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
california
say
it's
not
a
property
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
so
then--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so
then
the
question
is
whether
or
not
it
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in...
in
veterans'
disability,
statutory
provisions
that
protect
the
benefit
from
alienation,
generally
the
rule
is
the
recipient
cannot
alienate
it,
subject
to
execution,
et
cetera.
here
he
has
the
option.
what...
what's
the
purpose
of
giving
him
the
option?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
so
under
your
example,
if
you
have
two
different
cases,
in
one
veteran
spouse
has
no
property,
and
the
other
he
has
$50,000.
in
case
number
two,
i
take
it,
if
the
community
property
were
that
much,
the
wife
could
get
the
full
$50,000?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
isn't...
so
isn't
that
a
penalty
being
paid
by
reason
of
receiving
your
disability?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
still
have...
you
still
have
disparate...
disparate
treatment
of
veterans,
depending
on
the
amount
of
property
in
the
community
property
estate.
because
if
there's
nothing,
if
there's
no
community
property,
the
veteran
gets
100
percent
of
his
disability.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
california
have
a
rule
that
they
do
not
reach
federal
or
constitutional
questions
unless
there's
a
necessity
to
do
so?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--to
satisfy
a
property
settlement?
