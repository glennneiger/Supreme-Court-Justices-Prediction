chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
87-201,
gerald
e.
mansell
v.
gaye
mansell
forbes.
mr.
cone,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock,
mr.
cone.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
still
have
to
pay
for
them,
or
buy
them,
so
to
speak?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
hypothetical
recruit,
injured
on
the
first
day,
of
course,
would
not
have
had...
be
entitled
to
retirement
pay,
so
he
just
gets
va
benefits.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
cone.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
cornell.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
they
speak
of
res
judicata
in
that
opinion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you're
saying
that
when
a
military
retiree
converts
part
of
his
longevity
benefits
to
disability
benefits,
the
same
principle
applies?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i...
here
you've
got
a
problem,
it
seems
to
me,
with
federal
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
it
was,
it
was...
gee
a
final
judgment,
are
those...
are
the
matters
such
as
the
one
in
question
not
subject
to
being
reopened
under
california
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why...
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
anything
in
the
california
decision
saying
that
this
can't
be
reopened.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
really
is
a
ruling
on
the
merits.
you
would
think
that,
if
the
california
court
of
appeal
thought
that
res
judicata
were
appropriate,
they
would
not
have
reached
the
merits.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
was
the
kind
of
claim
that
was
rejected
in
hisquierdo
and
mccarty,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
seek
a
covert--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cornell.
mr.
cone,
you
have
eight
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
the
case
is
submitted.
