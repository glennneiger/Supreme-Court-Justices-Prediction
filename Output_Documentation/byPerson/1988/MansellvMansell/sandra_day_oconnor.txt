justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
certainly,
under
the
savings
clause
of
the
federal
act,
the
wife's
proposed
interpretation
is
certainly
an
arguable
one
here.
california
may
indeed
have
the
right,
as
other
states
do,
to
determine
the
nature
of
the
community
property
interest
and
to
make
a
division,
even
though
it
can't
be
garnished
out
of
the
disability
benefits.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
when,
when
congress
took
another
stab
at
this,
and
enacted
the
act
that
we're
asked
to
interpret
here,
it
certainly
was
their
intention
to
overrule
mccarty
and
to
leave
a
role
for
the
states
in
determining
marital
property
questions.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
effectively
overturned
it.
they,
they
enacted
this
law
to
overcome
what
this
court
had
said
in
mccarty.
would
you
concede
that
much?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
do
you
think
the
savings
clause
reserved
for
the
states?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
the
statute
does
not
specifically,
in
so
many
words,
prevent
the
states
from
considering
the
value
of
the
disability
pay
in
calculating
what's
owing
to
the
spouse.
