mr.
douglas
b.
cone
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
is
whether
california
may
divide
major
mansell's
va
disability
benefits
as
community
property
just
because
he
is...
was
a
military
retiree
as
opposed
to
civil
service
or
some
other
kind
of
retiree.
and
the
question
arises
because
of
the
unique
way
the
federal
government
treats
military
and
other
uniformed
service
retirees
concerning
the
va
disability
benefits.
the
military,
and
other
uniformed
members,
are
required
to
waive
a
portion
of
their
longevity
retirement
in
order
to
receive
va
disability.
in
effect,
the
military
retiree
is
required
to
purchase
his
own
va
benefits
with
part
of
his
longevity
pay.
no
other
class
of
federal
employees
is
required
to
make
that
selection.
so
we're
dealing
with
a
problem
that's
unique
to
the
military
services
here.
concerning
the
facts
of
the
case,
the
parties
were
married
in
1954,
and
major
mansell
was
commissioned
two
years
later
in
'56.
they
had
six
children
and
he
retired
in
1976.
at
the
time
of
retirement,
he
applied
for
a
va
disability
rating,
and
he
received
that.
in
1977,
the
parties
separated
and
the
children
remained
with
major
mansell
but
no
child
support
order
was
made
from
the
mother.
spousal
support
was
ordered
and
the
amount
was
equal
to
half
the
va
and
half
the
retirement
amount.
two
years
later
a
judgment
of
dissolution
was
entered.
once
again
major
mansell
received
custody
of
the...
then
one
remaining
minor
child.
but
once
again,
the
mother
was
not
required
to
pay
any
child
support.
the
husband
agreed
to
divide
the
retirement
and
va
disability,
in
essence
continuing
the
same
level
of
spousal
support,
this
time
in
the
form
of
a
property
division.
the
court
retained
jurisdiction
over
distribution
of
those
retirement
benefits
and
the
va
benefits.
after
this
court
issued
the
mccarty
decision,
major
mansell
went
back
to
court
with
a
motion
to
modify
the
judgment,
to
delete
the
paragraph
that
referred
to
division
of
va
disability
and
longevity
retirement.
that
motion
was
denied.
the
decision
was
affirmed
in
the
court
of
appeal.
the
state
supreme
court
refused
to
hear
the
case,
and
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction.
the
basic
heart
of
the
problem
in
this
case
is
the
way
california
treats
military
retirement.
they
can--
mr.
douglas
b.
cone
--well,
no
it's
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor,
the
res
judicata
argument
and
some
associated
collateral
estoppel
arguments
as
well
have
been
raised
by
the
appellee
at
every
stage,
the
trial
court,
the
court
of
appeal,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
appellee's
brief
specifically
refers
to
the
fact
that
he
did
raise
these
issues
in
all
of
the
courts
below
and
they
were
rejected.
in
other
words,
the
california
court
of
appeal
for
the
fifth
district
reviewed
his
collateral
estoppel
and
res
judicata
claims
and
determined
as
a
matter
of
state
law
that
it
was
required
to
reach
the
merits
of
the
case.
under
california
law,
there
is
a
procedural
device
for
a
motion
for
modification...
or
to
vacate
and
enter
a
new
and
different
judgment.
and
that's
the
procedure
that
the
court
of
appeals
took
this
case
to
be.
furthermore,
the
original
judgment
reserved
jurisdiction
over
the
distribution
of
the
assets
we're
talking
about
here,
so
that
the
res
judicata
wouldn't
apply
because
the
court
had
reserved
jurisdiction
to
make
further
orders
on
it.
california...
a
law...
allows
the
type
of
motion
we've
brought
here.
and
furthermore
even,
even
if
this
were
a
final
judgment
with
no
jurisdiction
reserved,
and
res
judicata
would
normally
apply,
it
wouldn't
apply
to
this
case
because
we're
talking
about
application
of
a
state
law
that's
preempted
by
federal
law.
it's
void,
it's
of
no
effect,
and
can
be
collaterally
attacked
at
any
time.
furthermore,
this
court's
own
precedents
allow
for
this
kind
of
case.
for
example,
the
ridgway
case,
a
portion
of
a
stipulated
family
law
judgment
was
vacated
by
this
court
even
after
the
military
retires
died.
so
the
res
judicata
arguments
have
been
raised
at
every
level
below,
and
rejected
at
every
level
below,
principally
relying
on
state
law.
and
it
set
out
in
the
jurisdictional
statement,
in
the
opinion,
i
believe,
it's
pages
d5
and
d6,
where
the
court
addressed
the
issue
and
found
that
it
was
required
under
state
law
to
arrive
at
the
merits
of
this
case.
now,
returning,
the
heart
of
the
problem
centers
around
the
way
california
treats
military
retirement.
they
consider
military
retirement
to
be
deferred
compensation
for
past
services,
and
therefore
vested
property
right,
subject
to
division.
and
they...
they
hold
this
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
this
court,
and
every
other
federal
court
who
has
ever
addressed
the
issue,
has
held
that
military
retirement
pay
is
current
reduced
compensation
for
current
reduced
services.
the
problem
is
further
compounded
by
the
fact
that
california
refuses
to
recognize
the
fact
that
the
retirement
pay
is
waived.
it
no
longer
exists
for...
if
the
veteran
is
disabled
and
takes
the
disability
election.
so
that
california
is
dividing
a
non-existent
asset,
giving
half
of
it
to
the
former
spouse
and
forcing
the
service
member
to
pay
it
out
of
whatever
assets
might
be
left.
mr.
douglas
b.
cone
well,
to,
to
begin
with,
number
one,
it's
not
a
property
right,
it's
income
earned
after
the
termination
of
active
service.
but
the--
mr.
douglas
b.
cone
--i
don't
think
so.
mr.
douglas
b.
cone
california
says
it
is
a
property
right--
mr.
douglas
b.
cone
--no
federal
law--
mr.
douglas
b.
cone
--that's
exactly
right.
this
court
ruled
specifically
in
u.s.
v.
tyler
that
it
was
current
compensation,
not
deferred
compensation
for
past
pay.
mr.
douglas
b.
cone
a
couple
of
responses.
in
the
first
place,
i,
i
don't
think
they
overruled
the,
the
decisions
of
this
court.
they
may
have
passed
new
laws--
mr.
douglas
b.
cone
--that
was...
that
was
their
intent.
and
i
think
they
accomplished
what
they
intended
to
accomplish,
and
that
is
they
intended
to
allow
some
portion
of
the
military
retirement
to
be
treated
as
property
in
certain
instances.
and,
and
the
act
doesn't
say
anywhere
that
it
is
a
property
right.
it
says
the
states
may
treat.
and
then
they
set
forth
the
conditions
under
which
it
may
treat.
mr.
douglas
b.
cone
i
think
that's
addressed
in
the
congressional
record,
where
they
described
the
purpose,
the
section
by
section
analysis,
where
it
says
that
that
is
specifically
to
preserve
existing
non-preempted
remedies.
and
that's
discussed
in
my
brief
at
some
length.
mr.
douglas
b.
cone
yes,
you
did.
and
they
had
some
options.
there
had
been
some,
some
other
areas
of
the
law
where
this
same
kind
of
question
came
up.
for
example,
the
cia
retirement
statute
has,
has
a
similar
set
of
problems
with
retired
spouses,
and
they
have
their
own
retirement...
spouse's
protection
plan,
if
you
will.
and
the
system
that
was
chosen
for
the
cia
is
described
in
50
united
states
code
section
403,
i
believe.
in
the
legislative
history,
in
talking
about
the
enactment,
it's
very
similar
to
the
kinds
of
problems
that
were
addressed
in
the
mccarty
decision,
and
in
the
amici
and
the
appellee's
brief
here.
and
congress
said
about
that,
concerning
specifically
the
former
wife,
both
their
support
of
the
cia
employee
spouse
and
their
direct
contribution...
and
congress
was
referring
to
the
agency...
often
prevented
the
former
spouse
from
acquiring
marketable
job
skills
and
pension
rights
and
imposed
familial
pressures
and
tensions
which
often
contributed
to
the
breakdown
of
the
marriage.
now,
their
solutions
to
that
problem,
which
is
the
same
problem
we
have
here,
was
to
enact
50
usc
section
403
that
provides
a
retirement
benefit
for
the
former
spouse
equal
to
50
percent
of
the
agent's
retirement,
but
paid
for
out
of
the
retirement
fund,
not
out
of
the
agent's
retirement
money.
congress
also
had
another
possibility
in
front
of
it
when
it
was
considering
the
former
spouses
protection
act,
and
that
was
senate
bill
1453.
and
the
title
of
that
bill
was,
non-preemption
of
state
law.
and
it
was
a
one-sentence
statute.
and
what
it
would
have
said
was,
in
essence,
the
state
law
shall
be
dispositive
of
all
matters
pertaining
to
retirement
pay.
so
it
had
these
two
extremes.
they
could
pay
the
former
wife
out
of
the
treasury,
like
they
did
for
cia
agents,
or
they
could
pass
a
one-sentence
law
that
says,
the
federal
government
doesn't
want
to
be
involved.
they
didn't
pick
either
one
of
those
options.
what
they
did
was
design
a
very
precise,
carefully
managed
system
for
disposable
retired
income.
and
they
defined
disposable
to
exclude
a
number
of
things.
and
among
the
things
that
it
excluded
is
va
and
the
taxes
and
a
number
of
other
things
that
i
can
set
out
forth
a
whole
list,
if
you'd
like.
but,
but
the
answer
is
that
this
court
invited
congress
to
provide
more
protection,
if
congress
thought
the
former
spouse
should
have
some.
and
they
had
some
options
in
front
of
them,
various
ways
they'd
done
things
in
the
past.
and
they
selected
this
one
as
opposed
to
any
other.
so
i
think,
just
reading
the
plain
meaning
of
the
law
that
they
did
pass
demonstrates
that
they
only
meant
to
allow
disposable
retired
pay
to
be
divided,
as
opposed
to
these
other
things
they
could
have
done
that
were
before
them
at
the
time.
starting
with
the
language
of
3101,
which
is
the...
the
anti-attachment
statute
though,
i
think
just
analyzing
the
language
of
that
shows
that
those
benefits
can't
be
reached.
in
the
first
place,
it
says
the
benefits
are
not
assignable,
except
to
the
extent
specifically
authorized
by
law.
there's
nothing
in
any
statute
anywhere
specifically
authorizing
va
disability
to
be
attached
or
in
any
way
levied
on
or
court-ordered
allotments
like
we
have
in
the
present
case,
or
for
any
other
purpose.
the
statute
also
ways
that
the
benefit
shall
be
exempt
from
taxation
and
the
claims
of
creditors.
well,
what
we
have
here
is
a
property
division
claim,
not
alimony,
not
child
support.
so
it's
just
a
creditors'
claim.
the
statute
says
specifically
that
the
benefits
are
exempt
from
creditors'
claims.
the
statute
also
says
that
the
benefits
shall
not
be
liable
for
attachment,
levy,
or
seizure
by
any
process,
either
legal
or
equitable.
now,
the
ex-wife
is
arguing
that
california
is
doing
nothing
to
the
va
disability
benefits.
nevertheless,
the
order
in
the
present
case
requires
major
mansell
to
initiate
an
allotment
directing
the
federal
government
to
pay
the
money
directly
to
the
former
wife.
it's,
in
essence,
a
constructive
trusts,
if
you
will,
and
the
government
is
the
trustee
paying
the
money
directly
to
the
wife.
well,
that's
a
seizure.
the
court
has
ordered
that--
mr.
douglas
b.
cone
--thank
you.
mr.
douglas
b.
cone
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
to
clarify
what
we're
talking
about,
on
the
veterans'
disability
benefits,
they're
based
solely
on
the
percentage
of
disability
and
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
length
of
service
of
the
member
or
his
rank.
for
instance,
a,
a
recruit
could
be
injured
on
his
first
day
of
basic
training,
so
he's
got
one
day
in
service,
and
if
that
injury
resulted
in
some
disabling
incapacitating
type
disability,
he
could
be
retired
that
day,
with
one
day
in
service.
so
we're
not
talking
about
something
that
you
have
to
get
20
years
into
service
to
get.
we're
talking
about
a
compensation
for
injuries
in
the
line
of
duty.
mr.
douglas
b.
cone
you
do
have
to
buy
them,
if
you
happen
to
have
served
long
enough
to
be
entitled
to
a
longevity
retirement
pay,
so
that
if
you
serve
your
20
years
and
also
have
a
disability
you
have
to
give
up
a
portion
of
your
retirement
pay
equal
to
the
amount
of
the
disability
pay.
so
in
essence,
the
answer
is
yes,
military
retirees
have
to
purchase
their
disability
benefits.
mr.
douglas
b.
cone
that's
exactly
right,
as
compensation
for
the
injury.
there
seems
to
be
a,
a
feeling--
mr.
douglas
b.
cone
--there
are
a
number
of
really
significant
advantages,
all
of
them
provided
by
congress,
and
some...
all
of
the
major
ones,
the
federal
ones
by
congress.
for
example,
the
disability
pay
is
exempt
from
federal,
state,
and
local
taxation.
but
that's
just
the
tip
of
the
iceberg.
there
are
a
lot
of
other
reasons.
perhaps
more--
mr.
douglas
b.
cone
--no.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
a
person
who
qualifies
for
a
rating
as
a
disabled
veteran
is
entitled
to
substantial
cash
benefits
for
his
children,
in
his
children's
own
name.
and
if
he
happens
to
still
be
married
there's
the
spousal
benefit
as
well.
of
course,
if
the
marriage
has
dissolved,
the
spousal
benefit
terminates.
but
the
child's
benefit
does
not
terminate,
so
that
if
you
just
go
on
with
your
longevity
benefit
the
child
gets
nothing.
so
there's
that
incentive.
also,
if
the
disabled
veteran
is
unable
to
work
because
of
that
disability,
then
there
are
major
educational
benefits
under
the
federal
law
for
the
child
that
would
not
otherwise
be
available.
in
california,
there's
a,
a
large
bundle
of
state
benefits
available
to
the
dependent
children
of
disabled
veterans.
but
the
key,
the
qualifying
event,
is
obtaining
the
va
disability
rating.
and
for
example,
they
get
first
priority
in
farm
and
home
loans
at
way
below
market
interest
rates,
but
you
have
to
have
a
va
disability
rating
to
get
that.
also,
children
of
disabled
veterans
in
california,
if
they
have
a
va
disability
based
on
unemployability,
are
entitled
to
free
tuition
at
the
state
colleges
and
universities
in
california.
so
there's
a
lot
more
to
it
than
just
doing
your
wife
out
of
half
the
retirement.
when
all
these
consequences
have--
mr.
douglas
b.
cone
--no,
not
necessarily,
because
remember
the
retirement
is
not
a
property
right,
it's
pay
for
reduced
services.
it's
not
a
property
right
at
all.
now,
california
treats
it
at
a
property
right,
and
under
the
new
former
spouses
protection
act
congress
allows
the
states
to
do
that
for
the
disposable
portion
of
it.
however,
the
statute
defines
disposable
to
specifically
exclude
the
va
disability
as
well
as
tax
on
a
number
of
other
things.
so
when
all
the--
mr.
douglas
b.
cone
--that's
correct.
but
a
statute
that
was
identical
to
the
3101,
word
for
word
identical,
was
considered
in
the
wissner
case.
and
what
this
court
said
in
wissner
was,
whether
directed
at
the
very
money
received
from
the
government,
or
an
equivalent
amount,
the
judgment
below
nullifies
the
deliberate
choice
of
congress,
and
it
cannot
stand.
well,
that's
exactly
what
we
have
here.
and
the
statute,
3101,
like
i
say,
is
identical
to
that
language.
similar
language
was
also
considered
in
your
case
of
free
v.
bland,
and
what
you
said
was,
viewed
realistically
the
state
has
rendered
the
award
of
title
meaningless.
therefore
it
cannot
stand.
mr.
douglas
b.
cone
frankly,
i
don't
know
why
the
congress
made
it
optional
when
at
the
same
time
they
made
it
so
attractive
for
not
only
the
veteran
but
so
attractive
for
his
family
that
no
reasonable
person
would
go
the
other
way.
i
know
of
no
case
where
anyone
has
ever
not
elected
it.
the
cases
in--
mr.
douglas
b.
cone
--perhaps
that...
that's
the
way
it
came
along.
the
earliest
versions
of
the
statute,
it
was
an
either/or
version.
if
you
were
receiving
any
form
of
disability
you
could
not
receive
longevity
retirement.
and
so
that
people
wound
up
with
a,
with
a
five
percent
disability
rating
were
being
knocked
out
of
their
entire
retirement
benefits.
and
so
eventually
this
3105,
which
is
the
dual
receipt
statute,
was
passed,
and
perhaps
it
was
done
for
just
that
reason.
for
the
cases
interpreting
language,
both
similar
and
in
other
statutes
identical
to
the
language
in
this
3101,
said
that
that
language
clearly
prohibits
offsets.
and
that's
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
an
offset.
and
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
douglas
b.
cone
yes,
i'm
going
to
waive
the
remainder,
your
honor.
