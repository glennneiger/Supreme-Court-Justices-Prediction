mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
it
is
important
to
understand
what
this
case
is
and
what
it
is
not.
there
was
a
stipulated
agreement
by
both
sides
in
1979,
both
sides
represented
by
counsel,
that
resulted
in
a
stipulated
judgment,
both
sides
represented
by
counsel,
in
1979.
in
1981
this
court
rendered
its
decision
in
the
mccarty
case.
february
1st
of
1983
was
the
effective
date
of
the
new
congressional
act
that
we
call
fusfspa.
and
then
after
that,
major
mansell
brought
the
motion
to
modify.
the
motion
to
modify
was
then
denied,
without
statement
of
reasons
in
the
trial
court.
motion
for
reconsideration
was
denied
without
reasons
in
the
trial
court.
that
motion
for
reconsideration
and
motion
for
modification
were
then
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeal
of
the
fifth
district
in
california,
which
rendered
a
decision
on
the
merits.
and
in
that
decision
on
the
merits
they
did
not
reject
the
res
judicata.
what
they
rejected
was
the
argument
that
the
motion
itself
was
not
appealable.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
no.
let's
make
it
very
clear
that
what
major
mansell
is
seeking
to
protect
here
is
not
his
disability
benefits,
but
the
rest
of
his
estate.
california
law
does
not
allow
the
attachment
of
disability
benefits.
california
law
does
not
allow
the
alienation
or
in
any
way
affecting
the
receipt
of
disability
benefits.
what
california
law
does
allow
is
a
calculation
of
longevity
benefits
to
include
that
portion
that
is
waived.
the
reason
for
that
is
very
simple.
they're
not
going
to
let
one
spouse
take
what
is
otherwise
a
community
asset,
and
then
through
that
spouse's
sole
control
change
the
asset
into
something
else
to
deny
the
rights
of
the
out
spouse.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
that...
that's
correct.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
that's
correct.
that
is
a
correct
statement
of
california
law.
california
law
does
not
seek
to
divide
disability
benefits,
whether
before
or
after
you've
reached
a
longevity
portion.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
if
the
guaranteed
cushion
that
you're
speaking
of...
yes,
you're
correct.
if
the
guaranteed
cushion
you're
speaking
of
is
the
disability
benefits
themselves,
because
they're
guaranteed
to
the
recipient.
and
we
cannot
get
those.
however,
if
the
person
has
another
estate
of
non-exempt
assets,
then
we
are
entitled
to
get
them
to
satisfy
the
complete
community
property
estate.
let
me
give
you
an
example
of,
of,
i
think,
something
that
will
make
it
very
clear.
if
there's
a
community
property
automobile,
and
one
of
the
spouses
takes
that
automobile
and
sells
it,
and
takes
the
proceeds
and
sticks
it
into
a
separate
property
account,
can
that
person
now
say
that
the
out
spouse
is
not
entitled
to
consider
that
separate
property
account
available
when
determining
the
nature
and
extent
of
the
community
estate?
of
course
they
can.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
yes.
that's
exactly
the
way
california
law
interprets--
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
--well,
the
problem...
we
don't
have
a
problem
with
federal
law,
because
in
this
particular
case
there
was
no
attempt
to
try
to
do
anything
that
contravenes
3101.
and
in
fact
that
was
brought
out
by
the
solicitor
general
in
both
briefs,
that
that
particular
argument
should
fall
by
the
wayside,
is
that
we're
not
attempting
to
attach
or
do
anything
of
that
nature.
what
we're
attempting
to
do
is
when
we
determine
the
nature
and
extent
of
the
community
estate,
we
commit...
we
consider
only
the
longevity
benefits,
not
the
disability.
but
we
consider
all
of
the
longevity
benefits
to
which
the
person
is
entitled
to
receive,
not
just
those
longevity
benefits
left
over
after
the
person
has
unilaterally
converted
them
to
their
own
estate.
so
the
protection
that
congress
thought
of...
let's
look
at
exactly
what
the
policy
of
congress
is
thinking
about
at
this
point.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
you
didn't
reject
it
in
wissner
because
in
wissner
there
was
a
claimed
property
right
in
the
insurance
benefits,
and
there
was
an
offset.
this
is
not
an
offset,
because
there
is
no
claimed
property
right
in
the
disability
benefits.
this
is
not
an
offset,
because
we're
not
saying
that
you're
entitled
to
all
your
disability
benefits
and
then
we
get
everything
else.
that's
not
what's
happening.
what
we're
saying
is,
here's
the
community
estate,
including
the
car
and
the
proceeds
from
the
car.
okay,
you
cut
off
a
corner
of
this,
but
we
still
consider
this
the
community
estate.
now
we're
going
to
satisfy
the
obligations
to
pay
the
portion
of
the
community
estate
through
state
law.
we're
not
going
to
seek
to
attach
any
federal
benefits.
let
me
give
you
the,
the
extreme
example
which
will
show
you
how
much
protection
the
veteran
has.
let's
say
that
the
only
estate
the
veteran
has
is
a
disability
benefits,
and
it's
achieved
through
receiving
disability
benefits
on
a
complete
waiver
of
a
longevity
retirement.
so
there's
no
longevity
retirement
left.
and
under
my
facts,
the
out
spouse
is
out.
well,
under
those
facts,
then
the
out
spouse
would
get
nothing,
because
under
california
law
we
can't
divide
the,
the
disability
benefits,
you
can't
execute
on
disability
benefits,
you
can't
do
anything
to
get
to
them.
so
the
veteran
is
still
protected.
and
the
governmental
interest
that
congress
set
up
when
they
established
veterans'
benefits
was
to
try
to
compensate
the
veteran
who
has
been
injured,
and
as
a
result
of
that
injury
is
now
less
employable,
less
able
to
earn
an
income.
that
is
still
guaranteed
under
the
approach
of
california
law,
because
the
money
is
still
guaranteed
to
him.
the
only
thing
we
get
is
if
there's
other
wealth.
and
the
fact
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
protect
the
other
wealth
is
reflected
by
the
fact
that
they
require
a
waiver
of
a
longevity
pension.
it
was
not
expected
when
you
got
a
disability
pension
that
you
would
have
another
pension.
when
the
person
applied
for
disability
benefits
they
did
not
expect
to
have
other
wealth.
congress,
when
they
created
the
system,
did
not
expect
that
there
would
be
other
wealth.
they
were
trying
to
compensate
for
the
lack
of
the
ability
to
get
other
wealth.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
that's
correct.
but
if
that
other
estate
is
there,
then
shouldn't
the
out
spouse
be
entitled
to
go
after
those
assets
to
try
to
satisfy
what
was
the
community
estate
before
it
was
dipped
into
and
converted?
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
no.
yes
and
no.
if
the
full
$50,000
is
owed,
they
could
get
the
full
$50,000.
but
under
the
facts
you
would
first--
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
--no,
it
is
not
a
penalty.
and
i
will
explain.
what
it
is
is
if
the
entire
estate
is
$50,000,
plus
a
longevity
pension,
and
let's
say
the
longevity
pension
waives
$1,000,
there's
a
$2,000
longevity
pension,
and
they
waive
$1,000,
leaving
$500,
what
california
would
do
would
divide
the
$50,000
in
half,
each
would
get
$25,000.
then
they
would
divide
the
longevity
pension
of
$2,000.
now,
you
come
up
short
$500
a
month,
because
$1,000
of
that
has
gone
to
disability
benefits,
all
of
that
is
exempt
from
attachment.
so
out
of
the
remaining
$25,000
of
the
community
estate,
the
out
spouse
would
be
attempting
to
try
to
collect
the
$500
a
month
that
the
out
spouse
is
losing.
there
would
be
no
attempt
to
try
to
award
all
of
the
rest
of
the
property,
because
there's
a
waiver
of
longevity
to
get
the
disability.
now,
again,
back
to
the
concerns
of
congress,
they're
met
most
ably
by
finding
for--
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
--yes.
the
disparate
treatment
is
of
the
out
spouse,
because
then
the
in
spouse
gets
the
disability
retirement
while
the
out
spouse's
ability
to
collect
his
or
her
portion
of
the
longevity
pension
has
been
stopped.
and
that's
solely
within
the
control
of
the
person
who
is
entitled
to
receive
a
longevity
pension
and
then
waives
a
portion
of
that
right
to
get
some
disability
pay.
the
only
person
that's
going
to
get
guaranteed
payments
under
that
fact
situation
is
the
disabled
veteran.
the
out
spouse
will
get
nothing.
now,
again,
returning
to
the
governmental
interests
that
are
involved
here.
what
if
gaye
mansell
prevails?
well,
first,
congress'
intent
to
provide
for
the
disabled
veteran
has
been
met.
the
disabled
veteran
will
still
read...
receive
his
or
her
disabled
retirement
benefits.
those
guaranteed
payments
will
go
to
someone
who
apparently,
or
presumably,
has
less
earning
power,
less
employability.
what
is
the
second
interest?
well,
the
second
interest
is
interest
expressed
by
congress
in
fusfspa,
and
that
is
of
the
out
spouse.
by
ruling
in
favor
of
gaye
mansell
you
will
have
met
that
concern,
because
she
will
have
considered
in
the
property
division,
as
set
forth
by
the
states,
the
longevity
pension
completely,
regardless
of
how
much
that
longevity
pension
has
been
converted.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
quite
understand
the
question.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
yes.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
she
would
be
entitled
to
get
one
half
of
the
longevity
pay--
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
--of
the
net
longevity
pay
still
available,
and
then
she
would
have
to
seek
to
collect
the
remainder
of
her
one
half
of
the
longevity
pay
through
other
assets.
the
veteran
would
get
all
of
his
disability
benefits,
because
that
cannot
be
detached.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
that's
my
argument,
that
he
should
not
be
entitled
to
reduce
her
half
of
the
estate
through
something
solely
within
his
action.
yes,
that
is
my
position
in
this
case.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
i
think
it
does
turn
on
it,
because
what
i'm
speaking
about
generally
is
a
law
of
the
state
of
california.
but
in
this
particular
case
we
have
a
final
judgment
that
was
adjudicated
four
years
before
there
was
any
attempt
to
set
it
aside.
and
we
have
a
final
judgment
that--
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
--that's
correct.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
they
are
not
subject
to
being
reopened
under
california
law.
and
in
fact
that
reservation
of
jurisdiction
over
distribution
is
an
enforcement
clause,
and
it's
common
to
many
judgments.
and
in
fact
the
first
time
that
particular
argument
was
raised
by
appellant
here
was
in
the
final
brief
filed
before
this
court.
it
was
not
raised
in
the
trial
level,
it
was
not
raised
in
the
court
of
appeal
or
before
the
california
supreme
court.
that
was
an
enabling
statute.
and
so
if
the...
for
example,
if
you
rule
in
favor
of
major
mansell
you
will
not
only
be
guaranteeing
him
his
disability
benefits,
because
the
relief
he
is
specifically
requesting
is
that
that
entire
enabling
paragraph
be
eliminated.
so
gaye
mansell
would
receive
nothing.
no
longevity,
no
disability.
and
he
is
asking
that
you
do
this
four
years,
now
ten
years
after
the
entry
of
the
agreement
and
the
judgment.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
there
was
nothing
in
the
california
decision
on...
yes,
that
said
it
could
be
reopened.
there
was
nothing
there
that
said
it
could
or
could
not
be
reopened.
what
the
california
court
of
appeal
did
was
rule
on
the
appeal.
they
didn't
say
that
it
was
barred
by
res
judicata.
they
didn't
say
it
would
not
be
barred
by
res
judicata.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
yes.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
yes.
and
if
this
court
rules
contrary
to
me,
i
believe
i
can
return
to
that
court
and
have
a
ruling
on
that.
the
fact
that
they
did
not
rule
on
that
basis
doesn't
mean--
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
--yes.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
i
don't
know.
i
can't
speculate
as
to
why
they
did
or
did
not.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
i'm
not
aware
of
such
a
rule.
there
is
a
clear
rule
in
california,
the
judgments
final
before
the
effective
date
of
mccarty
are
not
reopened
and
are
subject
to
res
judicata.
and
i
have
cited
those
in
the
briefs.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
if
there's
an
express
reservation
to
that
effect
in
the
opinion
of
the
court,
then
i
think
it
would
be
appropriate.
however,
if
there
isn't,
then
what
you've
done
is
say
that
all
of
the
judgments
that
were
entered
prior
to
the
mccarty
decision
are
now
wide
open
and
subject
to
relitigation,
and
all
agreements
are
set
aside.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
i
would
certainly
hope
so,
your
honor.
that's
why
i'm
here.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
yes,
i
did.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
they
said
nothing
about
it.
now,
what
is
the
third
interest
here
that's
before
you
in
these
issues?
and
if
you
rule
in
gaye
mansell,
how
will
it
be
treated?
the
third
interest,
of
course,
is
the
governmental
interest.
and
that
interest
was
very
eloquently
set
forth
in
the
decision
in
mccarty.
and
every
one
of
those
particular
concerns
were
addressed
by
the
armed
services
committee
of
the
united
states
senate.
and
that
body
found
evidence
that
none
of
them
were
going
to
be
violated
by
passing
fusfspa.
for
example,
they
found
no
evidence
that
there
was
any
impuning
of
the
ability
to
retain
or
recruit,
that
there
was
any
problem
whatsoever
with
the
personnel
management
of
the
military.
and
in
order
to
deal
with
the
other
specific
things,
they
crafted
the
law
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
sure
that
it
would
be
dealt
with.
now
what
if
major
mansell
prevails?
what
do
you
have?
well,
you're
going
to
have
a
situation
where
couples
that
are
identical
in
their
property
and
in
their
estate
and
in
their
facts
are
going
to
end
up
with
different
estates
divided
on
divorce
and
different
results.
that
is
an
unequal
treatment.
for
example,
the
person
with
a
disability
pension
of
ten
percent
will
have...
if
major
mansell
prevails
then
the
out
spouse
will
receive
five
percent
less
of
the
longevity
pension.
whereas
if
a
person
has
a
15
or
20
percent
disability
then
the
out
spouse
will
receive
7.5
or
10
percent.
people
in
identical
situations
get
different
results.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
the
maximum
amount
that
the
federal
government
will
allow
to
be
garnished
is
50
percent
of
the
disposable
retired
longevity
pay.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
less
the
applicable
taxes
and
other
matters,
yes.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
that's
correct.
and
prior
to
the
enactment
of
fusfspa
i
couldn't
attach
anything.
so
we
had
to
satisfy
solely
out
of
other
means
and
other
estates.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
i
would
hope
to
find
some...
part
of
an
estate
somewhere
that
i
could
get
something
out
of.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
i
cannot
get
it
out
of
the
remaining
retirement
pay,
because
there's
not
enough
left.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
especially
with
the--
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
--fifty
percent
of
the
disposable
retired
pay,
yes.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
that
statute--
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
--because
they
wanted
to
be
consistent
and
guarantee
to
the
disabled
veteran
that
he
would
actually
receive
those
benefits.
i
think
that's
entirely
consistent
with
the
scheme
that's
been
set
up
under
fusfspa.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
no,
that's
not--
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
--if
he
has
an
estate.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
but
the
actual
pay
will
not
be
taken
away
from
him.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
and
should
he
be
entitled
to
then
convert
the
car
to
a
bank
account?
is
that
what
you're
saying,
is
that
he
should
be
allowed
to
do
that?
i
don't
think
that's
what
congress
intended
when
they
enacted
fusfspa.
i
don't
think
that
carries
cut
the
purpose
of
congress
to
protect
the
non-military
spouse.
that
is
a
wrong
approach.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
that's
exactly
what
i
would
say.
because
disability
pay
is
not
community
property,
but
longevity
pay
is,
and
the
ability
to
convert
it
should
not
be
allowed.
now,
getting
back
to
the
federal
uniform
services
former
spouse
protection
act,
which
justice
scalia
referred
to,
i
think
the
clearest
indication
of
what
the
intent
of
congress
was
when
they
enacted
that
can
be
found
in
the
analysis
that
was
contained
in
the
house
conference
report
by
reference
to
the
senate
armed
service
committee
report,
which
says
specifically
at...
as
follows
or
page
16.
the
purpose
of
this
provision
is
to
place
the
courts
in
the
same
position
that
they
were
in
on
january
26th,
1981,
the
date
of
the
mccarty
decision,
with
respect
to
the
treatment
of
non-disability
military
retired
or
retainer
pay.
the
provision
is
intended
to
remove
the
federal
preemption
found
to
exist
by
the
united
states
supreme
court
and
permit
state
and
other
courts
of
competent
jurisdiction
to
apply
pertinent
state
or
other
laws
in
determining
whether
or
not
military
retired
or
retainer
pay
should
be
divisible.
however,
there
is
no
limit
or
a
spouse's
or
former
spouse's
right
to
deal
with
a
portion
of
a
member's
retired
or
retainer
pay
after
the
spouse,
or
former
spouse,
receives
that
pay.
that
is
a
quote.
that
is
a
clear
indication
of
congressional
intent.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
that's
correct.
but
what
the
significance
of
that
section
is
is
that
it
was
an
intention
to
reflect
that
there
was
never
an
intention
on
the
part
of
congress
to
preempt
the
state
courts
in
dealing
with
retirement
pay
in
family
law
matters.
and
once
the
state
courts
have
started
to
do
that,
preemption
has
been
taken
away,
they
should
be
able
to
deal
with
it
as
they
have
always.
and
the
law
in
california,
prior
to
the
mccarty
decision,
was,
as
i
have
explained
it
to
you.
and
it
has
been
for
a
number
of
years.
and
there
was
a
return
to
that
after
the
passage
of
fusfspa.
that
is
that
a
person
who
has
a
unique
control
of
a
community
property
asset
might
not
dissipate
that
asset
at
the
expense
of
the
other
spouse.
and
that
is
what
we're
asking
this
court
to
find,
that
states
should
have
the
right
to
return
to
pre-mccarthy
law,
based
on
the
enactment
by
congress
showing
a
congressional
intent,
to
allow
the
states
then
to
divide
the
benefits
as
the
states
feel
are
appropriate
under
family
law
rules
of
the
particular
states
involved.
i
think
the
entire
scheme
of
fusfspa
reflects
an
intent
on
the
part
of
congress
to
make
it
a
garnishment
statute
and
not
merely
to
limit
the
abilities
of
the
state
courts
to
divide
pensions.
and
in
this
respect,
the
second
brief
filed
by
the
solicitor
general
shows
that
there
are
two
reasonable
interpretations.
however,
there
are
a
couple
of
provisions
that
the
attorney...
solicitor
general
in
the
second
brief
failed
to,
i
think,
take
into
account
properly.
and
i
think
that
they
are
found
at
the
general
provision
of
allowing
payments
on
judgments
entered
june
25th,
1981,
and
earlier,
to
be
enforced.
well,
the
solicitor
general
reflects
that
that
was
merely
an
attempt
to
allow
the
garnishment,
and
was
not
a...
reflective
of
an
intent
by
the
part
of
congress
to
show
that
there
was
never
any
preemption.
that
doesn't
make
sense
because
the
effective
date
of
the
act
was
february
1st,
1983.
if
it
was
intended
to
be,
as
the
solicitor
general
indicated,
then
how
can
you
apply
it
to
pay
that
had
already
been
paid
almost
two
years
earlier?
that
pay
has
come
and
gone.
it
cannot
be
garnished.
the
only
reason
for
that
particular
reflection
of
a
date
in
the
statute
was
to
show
that
congress
specifically
intended
to
remove
the
preemptive
effect
of
mccarty.
there
can
be
no
other
reason
for
it.
also,
i
think
there
are
specific
provisions
contained
in
the
act
itself,
one
of
which
was
referred
to
by
justice
o'connor,
and
they
can
be
found
at
section
1408,
subsection
(e)(5)
and
(6).
basically
what
they
say
is
that
if
a
person
submits
a
court
order
that
is
irregular
on
its
face,
or
shows
that
it
should
be
paid
more
than
the
50
percent
limit,
that
order
will
not
be
deemed
in
violation
of
the
act,
and
will
still
be
followed
and
still
be
allowed.
and
there
will
still
garnishment
go
into
effect,
to
the
extent
of
the
limits
of
the
act.
so
that
in
essence
saying
that
an
appropriate
order,
even
if
it
says
more
than
50
percent
of
the
disposable
retired
pay,
is
still
a
valid
state
court
order,
and
in
fact
the
rest
of
the
act
shall...
indicates
that--
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
--she
would
get...
in
california
she
would
be
entitled
to
receive
$50
a
month.
however,
she
would
only
be
able
to
collect
40
of
that
through
the
federal
mechanism.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
the
remaining
10
she
would--
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
--yes.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
no,
it
wasn't,
because
there
there
was
a
property
right
claimed,
in
a
particular
asset,
and
then
there
was
a
direct
offset.
for
example,
you
get
your
retirement,
you
get
the
house.
and
the
person
arguing
hisquierdo
stood
right
on
front
of
this
court
and
said,
that's
exactly
what
he
wanted
to
wife
to
give,
the
house.
that
is
not
what
we're
seeking
here.
we're
not
seeking
an
over
one
half
division
of
the
remaining
assets.
what
we're
seeking--
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
--what
we're
seeking
is
the
ability
to...
to
garnish
the
remaining
assets
to
satisfy.
but
once--
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
--yes.
let's
go
one
step
further.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
yes,
it
was.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
yes.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
then
they
enacted
fusfspa
in
which
they
expressly
said
that
we're
overruling
mccarty
to
the
extent
they
can.
they
didn't
use
that
language.
they
used
the
language--
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
--and
the
only
way
that
that
particular
statute
makes
any
sense
is
if
you
read
it
as
a
complete
removal
of
the
holding
of
mccarty.
because
it
doesn't...
the
parts
of
the
statute
make
no
sense,
if
you
find
it
be
a
pure
garnishment
statute.
why
would
there
be
reference
to
june
25,
1981,
the
day
before
mccarty?
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
and
i
think
in
order
to
try
to
clear
up
some
of
those
things
you
have
to
look
to
the
congressional
intent
as
expressed
by
the
reports
that
were
issued.
and
there's
nothing
specifically
in
the
act
that
indicates
that
state
courts
are
limited
to
the
disposable
retired
pay
when
they
treat
it
as
property.
and
in
fact
there's
language
in
the
act
that
say
just
the
opposite.
for
example,
the
savings
clause
as
mentioned
by
justice
o'connor.
nothing
in
this
section
shall
be
construed
to
relieve
a
member
of
liability
for
the
payment
of
alimony,
child
support,
or
other
payments
required
by
a
court
order
on
the
grounds
that
payments
made
out
of
disposable
retired
or
retainer
pay
under
the
section
have
been
made
in
the
maximum
amount
permitted.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
yes.
and
as
a
garnishment
statute,
that's
appropriate,
because
that
particular
asset
is
one
that
is
inviolate
by
the
united
states
government,
and
we
are
not
seeking
to
divide
it.
but
i
think
an
important
distinction
should
also
be
made
on
the
ruling
of
the
offsets
in
hisquierdo--
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
--yes.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
no.
because
what
we're
dividing
is
the
military
retired
pay
of
$100.
that's
what
was
there
before
the
in
spouse
converted
it.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
that's
presuming
you're
reading
that
particular
statute
as
being
just
a
garnish...
excuse
me--
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
--not
just
a
garnishment
statute.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
yes--
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
--yes.
and
that's
all
we're
entitled
to
get,
is
one
half
of
that,
on
the
garnishment
basis.
reading
the
statute
itself
indicates
that
there
are
other
property
rights
which
are
entitled
to
be
received.
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
i'm
not
going
to
speculate
because
i
think
the
other
language
in
the
rest
of
the
statute
and
their
statements,
as
reflected
by
their,
their
reports,
show
that
their
intention
clearly
was
to
restore
the
states
to
the
condition
they
were
in
before
the
mccarty
decision.
let
me
give
you
a
practical
example
of
the
results
that's
going
to
occur
here,
is
that
if
you
allow
a
person
to
take
longevity
pay
and
convert
it
into
disability
pay
and
thereby
exempt
from
not
only
division
but
consideration,
which
is
what
major
mansell
is
seeking,
you're
going
to
have
a
situation
where
the
out
spouse
may
have
a
retirement
of
his
or
her
own,
through
some
other
method.
and
then
when
the
divorce
occurs,
he's
going
to
get
all
of
his
retirement.
he
or
she
is
only...
and
he's
going
to
get
half
of
the
other
one's.
that's
not
the
result
that
congress--
mr.
dennis
a.
cornell
--yes,
if
he's
converted
it.
and
if
it's
100
percent
he'll
get
all
of
that,
and
half
of
the
other
person's
retirement.
so
in
essence,
he
gets
75
percent
of
the
available
retirement.
that's
not
the
intent
that
congress
was
trying
to
do.
that's
not
what
they
were
trying
to
protect.
that's
not
the
interest
of
the
spouse
that
they
were
trying
to
protect
when
they
enacted
fusfspa.
thank
you.
