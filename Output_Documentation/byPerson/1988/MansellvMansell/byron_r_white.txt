this
would
be
the
same
argument
if
in
a
case
when
a
husband
and
wife
get
divorced
and
prior
to
that
time
he's
given
up
part
of
his
retirement
pay
to
get
disability.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
there
was
a
divorce
today
and
the,
the
officer,
the
retired
officer,
had
been
getting...
had
been
getting
retirement
pay
but
he
had
already
given
up
part
of
it
in
order
to
get
disability,
so
he's
getting
both
disability
and
retirement
at
the
time
of
the
divorce.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
wife
would
be
able
to
get
one
half
of
his
retirement
pay
just
as
though
he
hadn't
given
up
any
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
understand,
i
understand.
but...
so
as
far
as...
he
just
doesn't
get
his...
he
just
wouldn't
get
his
child
support
payments,
or
the...
he
just
wouldn't
benefit
from
the...
he
just
couldn't
get
reduced,
his
wife's
half
of
her...
of
the
estate.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that...
this
case
really
doesn't
turn
on
the
fact
that
there
has
already
been
a
settlement
and
they've...
things
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
should
we
decide
that...
if
we
just
decided
the
case
on
that
ground,
we
wouldn't
be
deciding
the
case
i
just
described
to
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
really
saying
that
there
is
a
way
that
you
could
win
this
case
but
on
a
ground
the
court
below
didn't
use.
justice
byron
r.
white
please
affirm
on
the
grounds
of
res
judicata.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
court
below
disposed
of
it
on...
disposed
of
it
on
this
other
ground,
though,
that,
that
california
can...
can...
needn't
take
that...
car
disregard
the
waiver
of
the
retirement
pay.
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
if
we
decide
on
the
merits,
you
may
win.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
win
on
the
merits,
how
much...
for
how
much
can
you
ask
the
federal
government
to
pay
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that's...
so
the
only
disposable
longevity
payment
that's
left
here
is
the
original
amount
less
what
was
waived?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
won't
be
able
to
levy,
to
garnish
the
federal
government
for
all
that
you
think
you're
entitled
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
it.
so
where...
so
where
are
you
going
to
get
the...
the
rest?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
you
can't...
you
can't
get
it
out
of
the
remaining
retirement
pay.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
can't...
the
most
that
you
can...
the
most
that
you
could
garnish
the
federal
government
for
would
be
50
percent
of
what's
left.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
get
this
right
now
as
to
what
you...
suppose
there
hasn't
been...
suppose
the
routine
is
this,
a
retired
officer
and
his
wife
are
married,
he
has
$100
a
month
in
retirement
pay.
he
then...
he
then
waives
20
to
get
disability.
that
leaves
a
net
of
80.
they
then
get
divorced.
now,
does
she
get
50
or
40?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think
then
under
the...
under
the...
you
should
be
able
to
collect
the
balance
out
of,
under
state
law,
out
of
any
other
assets?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
you're
not...
suppose
in
my
example,
there
hasn't
been
any
divorce
yet
but
there's
a...
he
had
100,
now
he's
got
80
in
retirement
pay.
now,
you
say
that
if
there's
then
a
divorce
california
courts
may,
may
divide
it
on,
on
the
basis
of
100?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
aren't
you
then
dividing
something
congress
says
you
can't
divide?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know.
but
if
you
do
that
it
seems
to
me
you're
flatly
contrary
to
the
statute,
says
that
your
disposable
pay
is,
is...
excludes
any
disability.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no,
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
the
time
where
you're
sitting
there
and
saying,
how
much,
how
much,
how
much
do
i
divide?
you
say
you
divide
100.
well,
he
hasn't
got
100
anymore
because
the
statute
says
he
hasn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
he's
just
got
80.
