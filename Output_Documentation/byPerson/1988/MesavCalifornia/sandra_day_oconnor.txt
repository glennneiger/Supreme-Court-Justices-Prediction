o'connor
the
second
case
is
mesa
versus
california
number
87-1206
which
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
in
the
summer
of
1985,
the
petitioners
mesa
and
ebrahim
were
employed
as
mail
truck
drivers
by
the
us
postal
service
in
santa
clara
county,
california.
in
unrelated
incidence,
the
state
of
california
issued
complaints
against
the
petitioners
for
criminal
traffic
violations
that
occurred
while
the
petitioners
were
driving
the
mail
trucks.
they
were
arraigned
in
state
court.
through
the
offices
of
the
us
attorney
for
the
northern
district
of
california,
the
petitioners
sought
to
remove
these
prosecutions
in
state
court.
the
federal
district
court,
pursuant
to
section
1442(a)
of
the
judicial
code
which
permits
removal
of
any
similar
criminal
prosecution
brought
against
a
federal
officer
in
state
court
for
any
act
done
under
color
of
office.
the
basis
for
the
removal
of
petition
was
that
the
traffic
violations
had
occurred
while
petitioners
were
on
duty.
federal
district
court
granted
the
removal
of
petitions,
but
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
issued
a
writ
of
mandamus
ordering
the
district
court
to
remand
the
prosecutions
to
the
california
state
courts.
on
the
ground
that
petitioners
had
failed
to
raise
a
colorable
federal
defense.
we
granted
the
petition
to
serve
to
resolve
a
conflict
among
the
circuits
concerning
the
necessary
predicate
for
federal
officer
removal
under
section
1442.
we
now
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
unanimously.
for
reasons
explained
in
the
opinion,
we
decline
to
depart
from
a
long
line
of
this
court's
precedents
dating
the
1868
that
requires
federal
officer
removal
under
the
statute
to
be
predicated
upon
the
assertion
of
a
federal
defense.
and
this
interpretation
avoids
potential
difficulties
under
article
3
of
the
constitution
that
might
arise
if
we
were
to
adopt
petitioner's
contrary
review.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
marshall
has
joined.
