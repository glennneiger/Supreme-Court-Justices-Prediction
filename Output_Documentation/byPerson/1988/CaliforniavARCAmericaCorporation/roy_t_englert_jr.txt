mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case
adopted
quite
a
remarkable
proposition.
the
states
are
powerless
to
deviate
from
federal
law
in
providing
remedies
for
conduct
that
is
deemed
to
be
illegal
by
both
federal
law
and
state
law.
the
court
adopted
that
position
because
it
saw
a
conflict
between
the
state
law
and
the
three
policies
that
mr.
greene
has
mentioned.
we
agree
that
the
three
policies
that
are
embodied
in
illinois
brick
and
that
were
mentioned
are
important
to
construing
the
clayton
act.
but
whether
they
give
rise
to
preemption
is
a
different
question.
we
think
they
do
not.
first,
a
general
point
about
preemption.
a
federal
statute
can
permit
that
which
it
does
not
require.
it
follows
that
the
policies
to
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
what
a
state
statute...
what
a
federal
statute
requires,
which
is
what
this
court
was
doing
in
illinois
brick,
can
be
quite
different
from
the
policies
taken
into
account
in
determining
what
a
federal
statute
forbids,
what
a
federal
statute
permits
the
states
to
do.
that
point
deserves
to
be
underlined
especially
in
this
case
because
both
hanover
shoe
and
illinois
brick
were
exclusively
concerned
with
what
section
4
of
the
clayton
act
requires.
in
answering
that
question
the
court
looked
to
a
number
of
policies,
not
particularly
closely
grounded
in
the
statutory
language
or
legislative
history,
but
of
course
that
was
legitimate
because
the
statutory
language
and
the
legislative
history
provided
very
little
guidance
to
the
court
in
how
to
answer
that
question.
so,
the
court
looked
to
general
concerns
of
compensation
deterrence
which
appropriately
inform
the
construction
of
how
far
the
federal
statute
reaches.
to
the
extent
there's
ambiguity
in
the
clayton
act
on
those
questions,
it
left,
the
field
open
for
the
court
to
impose...
not
to
impose,
to
discern...
rational
policy
in
that
case.
in
preemption
cases
the
question
is
different.
congressional
ambiguities
suggest
that
the
states
are
free
to
do
what
they
think
is
best.
they're
free
to
discern
appropriate
policy.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
think
so,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
of
anything
in
the
clayton
act--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--i
don't
know
of
anything,
your
honor,
that
would
prevent
a
state
from
saying
that
for
price
fixing
we
want
the
measure
of
recovery
under
state
law
to
be
four
fold
damages.
and
if
treble--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--all
right.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
the
states
can't
govern
the
remedy
for
the
federal
conduct.
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
but
the
states
can--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--that's
correct.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well.
the
states
can
proscribe
the
same
conduct
that
the
federal
government
proscribes.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
can
provide
a
larger
measure
of
recovery,
and
they
can
provide
that
larger
measure
of
recovery
notwithstanding
a
smaller
federal
recovery
that
has
already
taken
place.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
they
certainly
need
to
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
the
federal
judgment.
if
the
state
measure
of
damages
is
quadruple
damages,
they
would
have
to
credit
the
treble
damages
that
have
already
been
awarded.
but--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--they
can't
disregard
the
federal
judgment,
justice
kennedy.
i
think
general
supremacy
clause
jurisprudence
suggests
that
a
state
court
can't
disregard
a
federal
judgment.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
if
that
was
the
state's
intention,
the
state
could
do
that.
the
state
could
credit
the
treble
damages
and
say
and
we
want
an
additional
treble
damages.
ordinarily
that
doesn't
happen,
and
that's
why
in
response
to
the
question
justice
scalia
was
raising
earlier,
the
direct
purchaser
ordinarily
can't
go
to
federal
court,
get
his
recovery,
and
then
get
recovery
for
the
same
amount
under...
in
state
court
because
state
law
generally
doesn't
provide
for
sextuple
damages.
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
that's
not
what
ordinarily
happens.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
think
that's
fine.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that's
right
because
the...
the
clayton
act
goes
only
so
far
in
punishing
illegal
conduct.
it
doesn't
go
beyond
that
and
say
in
addition
to
stopping
at
some
point
in
our
punishment,
we
want
to
protect
against
further
punishment.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
because
this
statute
was
never
meant
to
protect
tortfeasors.
it
was
meant
to
punish
tortfeasors.
this
is
a
point
chief
justice
berger
made
in
his
opinion
for
the
court
in
texas
industries
v.
radcliffe
materials
where
again,
extra
liability
above
threefold
what
the
price
fixer
had
caused
was
at
issue.
the
chief
justice
said,
the
sherman
act
and
the
provision
for
treble
damages
action
under
the
clayton
act
were
not
adopted
for
the
benefit
of
the
participants
in
a
conspiracy
to
restrain
trade.
the
very
idea
of
treble
damages
reveals
an
intent
to
punish
past
and
to
deter
future
unlawful
conduct,
not
to
ameliorate
the
liability
of
wrongdoers.
congress
acts
against
a
certain
background
of
understanding,
but
that
background
of
understanding
is
often
based
on
what
congress
expects
state
law
will
do.
it
doesn't
impose
a
new
federal
rule,
merely
based
on
the
understanding
of
what
state
law
is
likely
to
be
like.
here
the
states
have
not
imposed
additional
damages
on
top
of
the
federal
recovery
for
the
same
victims.
the
states
have
chosen
to
compensate
different
victims.
the
ninth
circuit
thought
that
allowing
recovery
under
these
state
statutes
would
frustrate
the
policy
announced
in
illinois
brick
of
encouraging
antitrust
lawsuits,
that
it
would
remove
the
incentives
to
sue.
we
don't
think
that's
right.
the
concern
in
hanover
shoe
and
illinois
brick
was
underdeterrence.
the
court
was
afraid
in
the
court's
own
language,
that
the
violaters
might
retrain...
might
retain
the
fruits
of
their
illegality.
here
there's
no
question
at
all
of
that.
the
only
question
is
are
we
going
to
take...
how
many
times
are
we
going
to
take
the
fruits
of
their
illegality
from
them?
under
federal
law
we
already
have
taken
three
times,
and
the
state
law
raises
the
potential
of
taking
it
more
times
than
that.
if
there's
any
concern
in
this
case
it's
against...
it's
with
overdeterrents
of
the
antitrust
laws,
not
underdeterrents.
but
as
we've
been
discussing,
there's
nothing
in
the
clayton
act
and
the
structural
legislative
history
to
suggest
that
congress
had
a
carefully
calibrated
scheme
that
it
meant
to
go
so
far
and
prevent
anyone
else
from
going
further.
i'd
also
like
to
mention
on
that
point
the
california
v.
zook
case,
which
was
a
case
many
years
ago
decided
by
this
court
in
which
the
state
had
gone
further
than
federal
law
in
proscribing
the
precise
same
conduct
that
federal
law
proscribed.
although
the
court
was
closely
divided
on
that
case,
five
to
four,
the
court
explicitly
said
that
it
saw
no
problem
in...
in
the
states
imposing
harsher
penalties
for
the
same
conduct
than
the
federal
system
imposed
for
that
conduct,
and
indeed
we
see
that
in
the
double
jeopardy
dual
sovereignty
cases
as
well.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
