we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
87-1862,
california
versus
arc
america
corporation.
mr.
greene,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wasn't
this
case
pendent
to
a
federal
case?
didn't
it
originate
in
the
district
court
in
arizona?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
so
the
district
court's
jurisdiction
over
the
state
antitrust
laws
was
pendent,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
englert.
oral
argument
of
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
as
amicus
curiae
in
support
of
appellants--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
need
they
credit
the
federal
recovery
against
the
state
recovery?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
englert.
mr.
olson,
we'll
hear
from
you
now.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
olson,
i
would
find
it
helpful
if
sometime
in
your
argument
you
could
lay
out
kind
of
specific
facts
that
show
a
conflict.
perhaps
in
this
particular
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
my
question
was
directed
to...
and
don't
feel
bound
to
get
to
it...
is
give
us
an
example
of
the
kinds
of
recovery,
so
many
dollars
for
this,
so
many
dollars
for
that,
that
would
show
the
conflict.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you
don't
represent
a
defendant.
you
represent
another
plaintiff.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
there
something
less
drastic
to
control
the
situation
that
you
point
out
in
these
combined
cases
in
the
federal
courts
that
doesn't
require
you
to
preempt
a
simple
one-plaintiff
lawsuit
based
on
state
law
in
state
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
by
hypothesis,
you
have
to
deal
with
those.
if
you
have
to
say
there's
preemption
here,
you're
preempting
something
that
may
not
happen
very
often,
but
it
seems
to
me
the
argument
is
very
weak
there.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they're
competing
only
where
there's
a
settlement.
if
there's
no
settlement,
the
defendant
might
be
held
liable
on
all
the
claims
under
all
the
various
theories.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
state
can
surely
grant
additional
relief
under
its
statute.
all
the
claims
under
the
federal
statute
could
be
satisfied
and
there
still
might
be
additional
liability
under
the
state
statute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you're
speaking
in
terms
of
the
settlement.
are
you
saying
that
just
having
a
consolidated
lawsuit
in
federal
court
where
there's
no
settlement...
it
goes
to
a
jury
verdict
and
the
jury
finds
against
all
the
defendants...
that's
a
sort
of
complication
because
you
have
pendent
state
claims?
an
easier
way
to
solve
that
is
for
the
district
court
to
say
there's
no
pendent
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
have
to
throw
out
the
state
statutes
as
preemptive.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
want
to
have
your
cake
and
eat
it
too.
you
say
that...
that
one
of
the
reasons
we
want
pendent
jurisdiction
here
is
because
we
want
to
get
everything
together
and
consolidate
it.
and
then...
but
the
very
fact
of
consolidation
creates
this
complexity
that
you
say
necessitates
the
preemption
of
state
law.
i
don't
think
you
can
have
it
both
ways.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
that's
only
because
of
the
settlement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
won't
be
any...
there
won't
be
any
necessary
dilution
if
it
goes
to
a
jury
verdict.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
assume
you
have
a
defendant
that's
good
for
any
judgment
rendered
against
him.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
olson.
mr.
greene,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
87-1862,
california
versus
arc
america
corporation
will
be
announced
by
justice
white.
