justice
byron
r.
white
and
brought
solely...
and
brought
solely
under
state
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
the
court
of...
could
the...
this...
there
was
a
settlement
here,
i
guess?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
there
wasn't
a
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
judgment...
if
it
had
gone
to
trial
and
the
judgment
had
been
entered
under
federal
law
as
well
as
under
state
law,
what
then,
about
downstream
recovery?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
there
could
be
recovery
in
that
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
critical
for
recovery
under
state
law
that...
that...
i
think
that
you
said
that
you
would
have
to
prove
or
pass
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know...
by
the
direct
purchaser
having
passed
it
on,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
if
the...
if
there
hasn't
been
a
pass-on,
no
recovery?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there's
been
a
partial
pass-on,
just
partial
recovery?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
suggesting
that
a
state
could
provide
an
additional
remedy
for
violation
of
the
clayton
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
have
to...
the
case
would
have
to
go
forward
in
the
federal
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
you're
talking
about...
i
just
said
that...
the
action
in
the
federal
court
is
solely
under
federal
law,
federal
antitrust
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
then
the
question
of
remedy
comes
up,
and
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
so...
so,
you're
really
talking
about
a
recovery
under
the
state
antitrust
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
illinois
brick
didn't
deal
with
state
law,
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
know
how
there
can
be
a
conflict.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
far
as
overruling,
you
can't
overrule
a
case
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
an
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
i
think
they
did.
i
think
they
undoubtedly
did
under
state
law.
under
state
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
take
it
your
position
would
be
the
same
if
this
suit
had
been
brought
in
the
state
court
and...
and
obviously
there
couldn't
express...
couldn't
allege
any
federal
antitrust
claim,
just
solely
a
state
law
antitrust
recovery
in
that
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose...
a
lot
of
your
problems
would
disappear
if
it
were...
if
you
could
always
tell
at
a
glance
whether
something
had
been
passed
on.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
it
were
at
a
glance,
why
i
don't
suppose
that
the
direct
purchaser
would
be
deprived
of
anything
if
he
had
passed
it
all
on
and
you
could
know
he
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
but...
but
if
a...
if
this
case
had
gone
to
trial
and
there
were
state
claims
and
there
were
federal
claims
in
it,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
state
claims,
if
the
state
claims
are
just
presented
by
indirect
purchasers,
let's
just
assume
the
only
state
claims
were
indirect
purchaser
claims.
they
should
never
go
to
the
jury
under
your
theory.
they
should
be
dismissed.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'm
just
saying
in
this
case
under
your
theory
if
there
were
only
indirect
purchasers
asserting
state
law
claims,
their
claims
should
be
dismissed
and
they
should
never
go
forward.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
you
said
they
were
preempted,
that
they
could
never
recover.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
they
should
be
dismissed
at
the
outset.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'll
ask
you
why
in
a
minute.
no
comment.
justice
byron
r.
white
tell
me
what
time,
what
do
you
mean
multiple
litigation?
you
mean
some
in
state
court
and
some
in
federal?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
under
your
theory
you
go
right
into
state
court
and
say
if
they
are
indirect
purchaser
claims,
you
say
dismiss
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
win
here--
--i
think
that's
assuming
that
you
win
here.
if
you
win
here,
well,
what--
justice
byron
r.
white
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
that
court.
the
opinion
and
sum
filed
with
the
clerk
explains
why.
the
opinion
is
unanimous
except
the
justices
stevens
and
oâ€™connor
who
took
no
part
in
the
case.
