justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
greene,
you're
relying
on
the
separate
sovereign
theory.
i
suppose
that
would
apply
to
claims
by
the
direct
purchaser
as
well.
why...
why
couldn't
the
direct
purchaser,
having
recovered
once
under
the
federal
statute,
on
your
theory,
having
recovered
once
under
the
federal
statute,
he
could
recover
against
under
the
state
statute.
would
there
be
no
preemption
of
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
wouldn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
wouldn't
in
this
case,
but
if
the
state
supreme
court
said
we
don't
care
whether
you
recovered
under
the
laws
of
a
separate
sovereign
or
not.
we're
going
to
give
you
recovery
again,
you'd
say
that
would
be
okay
as
far
as
federal
law
was
concerned?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
must
say
i...
it
seems
to
me
that...
well,
let's
just
do
it
on
a
state-by-state
level.
it
seems
to
me
when
a
state
adopts
a
tort
provision
providing
for
somebody
to
recover
for
injury
caused,
that
state
doesn't
envision
that...
that
the
person
recover
again
and
again
and
again
under
the
law
of
other
states,
and
that's
why
the
second
state
if...
if
the
person
having
once
recovered
should
seek
to
recover
again
by
suing
in
another
state
under
that
state's
tort
law,
the
second
state
would
say
no,
our
law
won't
let
you
do
it.
now,
when
there
are
two
states,
neither
one
can
bump
the
other.
so,
whichever
one
he
happens
to
sue
first
in,
wins.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
don't
know
why
when...
when
you
apply
that
same...
that
same
intent
at
the
federal
level
it
isn't
the
case
that
the
federal
law
just
bumps
the
state
law.
we've
provided
for
recovery
and
if
you
recover
from
us
under
the
sherman
act
or
under
the
clayton
act,
we
don't
care
what
a
state
wants.
if
a...
a
state
cannot
give
you
a
recovery
for
the
same
tort.
don't
you
think
that's
the
intent
that
somebody
who
passes
a
tort
statute
normally
has?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
didn't
say...
that's
not
the
theory
of
our
decision
in
illinois
brick.
the
theory
of
our
decision...
we're
being
faithful
to...
to
the
statute
in
illinois
brick.
it
says
the
person
injured.
we
have
said
in
illinois
brick
that
the
person
injured
has...
has
recovered.
i
mean,
isn't
that
the
theory
of
our
case?
we...
we
don't
avow
that
we're
giving
recovery
to
somebody
who
hasn't
been
injured.
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
green,
is
there
any
way
that
a
corporation
that's
sued
under...
under
the
clayton
act
can
avoid
after
having
fought
hard
and
won...
he
gets
a
jury
verdict
that
there's
no
conspiracy
in
restraint
of
trade.
is
there
any
way
he
can
avoid
having
to
relitigate
the
same
conspiracy,
the
same
conspiracy
charge
under
state
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
the
plaintiff
in
one
case
is...
is
the
direct
purchaser.
in
the
other
case
it's
the
consumers.
they
choose
not
to
come
into
the
first
action.
indeed,
there's
no
need.
it
would
be
useless
for
them
to
come
into
the
first
action
because
under
illinois
brick
they
can't
recover,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
defendant
could
not
implead
them
either,
could
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
because
they
have
no
interest
in
the
case.
so,
it
seems
to
me
we're
setting
up
a
situation
where...
you
know,
if
you
ever
go
to
trial,
you've
got
to
try
it
again
under
state
law,
even
if
you
win.
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
have
no
doubt
it's
okay.
my
only
question
is
whether
congress
intended
it.
that's
all.
i
think
that's
what
we're
discussing
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sure
it
can
happen.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
but
assume
a
state
that
thinks
otherwise,
and
the
state
law
says
we
don't
care
whether
this
plaintiff
has
recovered
under
the
clayton
act
or
not.
we
want
to
give
him
under
our
state
law
triple
damages.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
fine.
so,
you
get
six
times
despite
the
fact
the
clayton
act
says
only
three.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
come
back
to
the
suggestion
i
made
earlier.
the
reason
that
a
state
normally
would
not
allow
a
person
to
recover
in
the
second
tort
action
for
the
same
tort
is
that
it's
just
generally
understood
in
our
system
that
you
allow
one
recovery
per
tort.
and
the
person
who
injures
somebody
pays
once.
and...
now,
state
to
state
there's
no
way
of
enforcing
that
understanding.
but
where
you
have
a
federal
statute
that's
based
on
that
tort
type
of
understanding,
i
don't
know
why
it
would
allow
a
state
to...
to
upset
the
understanding
by
saying
we're
going
to
allow
tortfeasors
to
be...
to
be
liable
twice
instead
of
just
once.
