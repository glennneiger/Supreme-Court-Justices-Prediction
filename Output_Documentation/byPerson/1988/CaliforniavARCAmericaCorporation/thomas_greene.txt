mr.
thomas
greene
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
comes
to
the
court
today
from
the
ninth
circuit
on
appeal.
the
question
presented
today
is
whether
state
downstream
purchaser
remedies
for
victims
of
anticompetitive
conduct
are
preempted
by
section
4
of
the
clayton
act.
the
lower
court
determined
that
these
downstream
purchaser
remedies
stand
as
an
obstacle
to
the
accomplishment
of
the
full
purposes
and
objectives
of
federal
antitrust
law.
there
was
no
assertion
by
the
lower
court
that
federal
law
occupies
the
field
of
antitrust,
nor
was
there
an
explicit
finding
by
the
lower
court
that
it
was
impossible
for
price
fixers
to
pay
both
state
sanctions
and
federal
sanctions.
the
issue
before
the
court
today
is
whether
there
is
an
irreconcilable
conflict
between
state
and
federal
law
with
respect
to
these
remedies.
we
believe
the
decision
below
warrants
reversal
for
two
major
reasons.
the
first
of
those
is
that
the
assertedly
preemptive
policies
focused
upon
by
the
lower
court
were
confined
by
their
very
terms,
by
the
very
terms
of
illinois
brick
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
federal
antitrust
laws
to
the
section
4
federal
remedy.
as
a
consequence,
there
is
no
conflict
in
this
case
between
congressional
policies
and
state
law.
secondly,
not
only
do
state
downstream
purchaser
remedies
not
frustrate
the
federal
scheme,
we
believe
that
they
indeed
advance
congressional
policies
of
deterrents
and
compensation
for
victims
of
price
fixing.
the
lower
court
imputed
three
policies
to
congress
which
assertedly
preempted
states'
laws.
those
were
avoidance
of
unnecessarily
complex
litigation,
creation
of
specific
incentives
for
federal
section
4
plaintiffs,
and
elimination
of
multiple
liability
for
antitrust
defendants.
with
respect
to
complexity,
our
reading
of
this
court's
decision
in
illinois
brick
is
that
the
complexity
concern
was
focused
on
the
imposition
of
a
burden
upon
federal
plaintiffs
to
show
that
they
had
not
passed
on
the
anticompetitive
injury
further
down
the
stream
of
commerce.
we
believe
that
states'
laws
do
not
alter
that
provision
of
federal
law.
we
do
not
impose
that
burden
upon
them
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
their
federal
remedy
remains
unimpugned
and
uncomplicated
by
any
sort
of
pass-on
determination.
we
do
not
perceive
there
to
have
been
a
congressional
policy,
nor
indeed
a
policy
articulated
by
this
court
in
illinois
brick
with
respect
to
some
broader
anti-complexity
policy
of
the...
in
the
federal
system.
even
assuming
that
there
were
such
a
policy,
we
don't
believe
that
that
would
be
implicated
by
states'
remedies
here.
first,
pragmatically,
since
illinois
brick's
state
downstream
purchaser
actions
are
being
brought
in
state
court
in
the
states
in
which
legislatures
have
indicated
that
they
are
willing
to
bear
the
burden,
whatever
that
may
be--
mr.
thomas
greene
--and
brought
solely
under
state
law,
that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
thomas
greene
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
greene
that's
also
correct.
mr.
thomas
greene
well,
you'd
have
the
downstream
purchaser's
claim
under
the
laws
of
a
separate
sovereign,
so
you
would
have
them
both
claiming
under...
on
the
basis
of
the
distinct
laws
upon
which
they--
mr.
thomas
greene
--absolutely.
mr.
thomas
greene
correct.
mr.
thomas
greene
if--
mr.
thomas
greene
--well,
the
situation
with
respect
in
california,
the
effect
of
the
ninth
circuit
decision
is
to
be
essentially
a
decision
which
has
the
effect
of
a
decision
of
a
sister
state,
so
it
does
not
have
precedential
force
within
the
state
of
california.
if
this
court
were
to
adopt
in
essence
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit,
that
would
be
correct.
we
would
be
unable
to
go
forward.
mr.
thomas
greene
there
would
be
no
preemption
of
that.
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
that
would
not
happen.
perhaps
the
more
analogous
situation
would
be
a
situation
in
which
a
direct
purchaser
recovered
under
section
4
and
then
you
also
had
the
imposition
of
state
civil
penalties,
for
example,
the
henderson
brothers
out
of
the...
the
henderson
brothers
decision
out
of
the
second
circuit
essentially,
that
kind
of
situation.
but
in
terms
of
the...
the
direct
purchaser
coming
again
under
state
law,
state
law
would
not
allow
that.
mr.
thomas
greene
if
the
state
were
to
modify
its
law,
it
might
be
possible.
mr.
thomas
greene
i
think
that
is
absolutely
right.
i
mean,
as
a
matter
of
supremacy
clause
analysis,
there
is
no
indication
that
we
have
been
able
to
find
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
sherman
act
to
indicate
that
there
is
some
sort
of
federal
cap
of
any
kind.
so,
we
believe
that
this
matter
is
given
to
the
states
and
insofar
as
they
exercise
their
judgment
in
that
area,
then
that
judgment
should
be
respected.
so,
as
i
was
saying--
mr.
thomas
greene
--i
think
that's
more
properly
a
matter
that
should
be
assessed
under
probably
the
bankruptcy
laws
of
the
united
states.
the
principle
that
the
appellees
in
this
case
have
forwarded
to
the
court
is
the
notion
that
the
direct
purchasers'
remedy
takes
precedent
over
virtually
anything,
and
we
see
no
logical
stopping
place
for
that.
for
example,
we
don't
know
if
that
means,
for
example,
that
a
contract
claim,
which
is
based
on
state
law
or
a
tort
claim
for
an
injury,
a
personal
injury,
would
be
bumped
by
the
direct
purchaser's
claim.
we
think
that
it's
more
properly
a
matter
of
bankruptcy,
and
i
think
that
that
would
be
our
response.
mr.
thomas
greene
we
would
think
that
that
situation
is
so
unlikely
that
it
really
should
not
be
a
basis
for
your
decision.
i
think
that
given
the
legislative
history
of...
of
the
federal
acts,
particularly
the
fact
that
they
have
strongly
supported
the
idea
of
state
antitrust
and
indeed
there
is
some
relatively
recent
history
which
we
cited
in
our
briefs
which
indicates
there
may
be
explicit
approval
of
just
these
kinds
of
remedies,
i
think
some
tension
which
may
be
at
play
underlying
your
question,
i
think
that's
probably
fine
and
does
not
render
our
statutes
unconstitutional.
mr.
thomas
greene
um-hum.
mr.
thomas
greene
well,
i
think
that
the
situation
post-illinois
brick
is
that
our
state
statutes
provide
for
recoveries
only
if
you
are
injured,
in
fact,
and
to
basically
the
extent
of
your
injuries
in
fact.
so,
in
effect,
the
federal
system
has
become
in
many
ways
sort
of
a
federal
civil
penalty
system
insofar
as
actual
injuries
passed
down
the
chain
of
commerce.
so,
i
think
that
in
terms
of
the
tort
point
to
follow
up
on
that,
here
we
have
injury...
recoveries
by
plaintiffs
who've
been
injured
in
fact
by
anticompetitive
conduct.
because
of
that,
they
do
not
duplicate
recoveries
at
another
level.
i
mean,
they
are
getting
only
for
their...
the
injuries
that
they
have,
in
fact,
sustained.
so,
you
don't
have
a
duplicative
situation.
mr.
thomas
greene
well,
i
think
that's...
that's
correct,
but
you
also
do
not--
mr.
thomas
greene
--in
the
analysis
in
illinois
brick
you
also
did
not
indicate
that
downstream
purchasers
had
not
been
injured.
i
mean,
the
fact
that
it
is
passed
on
does
not
suggest
that,
you
know,
folks
who
are,
you
know,
for
example,
the
taxpayers
in
this
case
didn't,
in
fact,
pay
an
overcharge.
the
buck
stopped
with
our
taxpayers,
basically.
that's
not
to
say
that
the
direct
purchasers
did
not
sustain
some
injury
and
certainly
sufficient
to
support
a
section
4
recovery.
but,
in
fact,
the
injury
has
stopped
with
us
in
this
case.
with
respect
to
state
downstreaming,
with
respect
to
the
complexity
point,
federal
courts
will
hear
these
matters
in
most
cases
in
our
judgment
if
at
all
as
pendent
state
law
claims.
and
under
the
pendent
state
law
claim
doctrine,
that
is
totally
discretionary
with
the...
with
the
federal
trial
court.
there
is
the
bare
possibility
that
in
some
cases
federal
and
state
claims
might
be
heard
together
in
diversity
actions,
but
in
our
judgment,
the
more
complex
the
antitrust
action
at
the
state
level,
the
less
likely
because
of
the
complete
diversity
requirement
these
matters
will
actually
come
to
federal
court.
ultimately,
however,
we
cannot
and
it
is
very
difficult
for
us
to
see
that
diversity
jurisdiction,
one
of
the
major
tools
of
the
constitution
to
create
and
preserve
the
federal
system,
should
now
turn
into
an
enemy
of
that
system
itself.
with
respect
to
incentives
for
direct
purchasers,
the
claims
based
on
state
law
do
not
diminish
by
their
own
operation
the
direct
purchasers'
recovery
under
federal
law.
as
the
california
supreme
court
noted
in
its
union
carbide
decision,
questions
of
whether
overcharges
were
passed
on
essential
to
the
indirect
purchasers'
california
claim
are
irrelevant
to
and
thus
not
subject
to
inconsistent
determination
in
a
suit
on
the
direct
purchasers'
federal
claim.
federal
law
as
construed
by
illinois
brick
provides
a
particular
recovery
as
determined
by
this
court.
state
law
does
not
limit
that
recovery.
there
is
simply
no
impact
of
state
law
on
federal
law.
in
our
judgment
this
case
is
essentially
on
all
fours
with
the
silkwood
decision.
federal
law
has
established
a
certain
sanction
at
the
federal
level.
states
have
now
gone
forward
and
provided
yet
an
additional
sanction,
and
that's
perfectly
reasonable
under
the
constitution.
mr.
thomas
greene
well,
i
think
that
would...
that
would
really
turn
on
doctrines
of
collateral
estoppel
and
res
judicata.
i
would
think
that
depending
on
the
relationships
of
the
parties,
i
would
think
that
that
would
probably
be
very
likely
that
he
would
be
able
to.
mr.
thomas
greene
um-hum.
mr.
thomas
greene
the
only
precedent
is--
mr.
thomas
greene
--well,
i
think
that
that's...
that
may
be
possible.
i
think,
again,
it
would
depend
on
the
doctrines
of
collateral
estoppel
and
ultimately
on
relationships
of
the
parties.
but
that's
not
dissimilar
from
the
same
situation
that
was
created
in
your
double
jeopardy
cases.
for
example,
in
heath
there
were
two
trials
involving
the
same
alleged
murder,
one
in
one
state
resulted
in
life
imprisonment.
the
second
one
resulted
in,
as
i
recall
it,
the
death
penalty.
two
trials,
two
sanctions,
and
that
is
okay
from
our
perspective
under
the...
under
the
constitution.
pragmatically
i
think
that
in
all
likelihood--
mr.
thomas
greene
--certainly.
mr.
thomas
greene
but
the...
the
congressional
history
with
respect
to
the
antitrust
laws
is
so
firmly
supportive
of
the
notion
of
state
efforts
in
the
antitrust
area.
indeed,
the
federal
antitrust
laws
were
initially
enacted
as
a
supplement
to
state
law.
and
there's
a
long
history
of
mutual
supportive
behavior
on
the
state
side
and
the
federal
side.
grants
have
gone
from
the
federal
government
to
the
states
in
order
to
arm
them
to
be
able
to
deal
both
under
state
and
federal
law
in
the
antitrust
area,
other
specific
provisions,
15
usc
15
(f)
requires
federal
authorities,
my
federal
colleagues
to
cooperate
with
my
investigative
efforts
in
order
to
keep
fresh
and
vigorous
the
two-tiered
antitrust
enforcement
system
which
the...
the
preemption
of
these
kinds
of
statutes
would
have
a
direct
impact
on.
mr.
thomas
greene
you
have
to
prove
that
you
have
been
injured.
that's
certainly--
mr.
thomas
greene
--you
would
have
to
show
that
it
certainly
came
from
someplace,
that's
right.
but
it
would
be
the
burden
of
the
person
claiming
under
state
law
to
show
that
and
in
most
cases
that
would
be
something
that
would
be
shown
in
a
state
proceeding,
in
state
law.
mr.
thomas
greene
absolutely,
right.
mr.
thomas
greene
that
would
be
correct.
that's
right.
it
strikes
us
that
not
only
do
these
state
statutes
not
frustrate
the
purposes
and
goals
of
congress,
they
do
indeed
advance
those
purposes
and
goals.
certainly
one
of
the
key
points
made
in
the
illinois
brick
decision
was
the
importance
of
deterrence
and
enforcement.
this
case
itself
was
brought
by
the
arizona
attorney
general's
office,
who
was
investigated
using
state
subpoena
power.
it
is
clear
that
downstream
purchasers,
particularly
we
think
when
represented
by
state
attorneys
general--
mr.
thomas
greene
--it
was
initially
filed...
the
state
of
arizona
filed
a...
a
complaint
in
federal
district
court
in
the
district
of
arizona,
which
was
based
on
both
a
violation
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
and
a
violation
of
the
arizona
antitrust
act.
but
it
was
the
arizona
state
officials
who
investigated
the
case
and
first--
mr.
thomas
greene
--was
pendent,
certainly,
and
it
was
filed
in
1976,
before
this
court's
decision
in
illinois
brick.
and
ultimately,
as
a
side
note,
the
trial
court
in
1984,
i
believe,
actually
separated
the
state
claims
off
on
a
gibbs
analysis,
so...
just
before
a
trial
which
actually,
in
fact,
never
came
off.
those
claims
were
separated.
unless
there
are
further
questions
at
this
time,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
thomas
greene
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
unless
there
are
further
questions
of
the
court,
the
state
submits.
