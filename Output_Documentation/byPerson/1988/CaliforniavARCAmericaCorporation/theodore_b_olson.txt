mr.
theodore
b.
olson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
twice
determined
that
federal
indirect
purchaser
litigation
would
have
an
impermissible
impact
on
the
enforcement
of
the
antitrust
laws.
in
the
words
of
illinois
brick,
the
effectiveness
of
the
antitrust
treble
damages
action
would
be
substantially
reduced
by
adopting
a
rule
that
any
party
in
the
chair
of
distribution
may
sue
to
recover
the
fraction
of
the
overcharge
allegedly
absorbed
by
it.
the
state
indirect
purchaser
laws
at
issue
in
this
case
authorize
precisely
such
litigation
and
are
preempted
because
they
weaken
antitrust
enforcement
in
exactly
the
same
manner
and
to
an
equal
or
even
greater
extent
as
the
federal
indirect
purchaser
claims
rejected
by
illinois
brick.
there
are
two
overriding
issues
that
dominate
this
case.
the
first
is
the
effect,
the
pernicious
effect
of
state
indirect
purchaser
remedies
on
federal
antitrust
enforcement,
and
the
second,
of
course,
is
whether
those
effects
present
an
intolerable
obstacle
to
the
accomplishment
of
federal
policy
and
trigger
the
preemptive
force
of
the
supremacy
clause.
turning
first
to
the
effects
of
the
state
indirect
purchaser
remedies
on
the
federal
direct
purchaser
treble
damage
remedy,
in
this
case
a
conflict
between
the
state
law
and
the
federal
law
was
inevitable
because
the
state
indirect
purchaser
laws
reject,
directly
reject
the
federal
approach
to
antitrust
enforcement.
they
are
commonly
referred
to,
these
state
laws,
as
illinois
brick
repealers,
and
the
reason
that
they
are
referred
to
as
illinois
brick
repealers
is
that
by
and
large
they
were
enacted
for
the
purpose
of
overturning
to
the
extent
of
indirect
purchaser
recovery
under
state
law,
this
court's
decision
in
illinois
brick.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no,
it
dealt
with
federal
law.
but
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
illinois--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
court...
the
states
have
indicated
and
the
california
court
has
described
the
legislature's
intent
in
california
as
enacting
the
minority
opinion
or
the
dissenting
opinion
in
illinois
brick.
now,
i
recognize--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--illinois
brick,
i
submit,
respectfully,
justice
white,
has
to
do
with
what
mechanisms
and
devices
may
affect
adversely
the
effectiveness
and
the
enforceability
of
the
federal
antitrust
laws.
and
what
the
states
have
done
is
enact
the
very
mechanisms
that
this
court
said
were
destructive.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
our
position
would
be
the
same.
in
fact,
the
court
should
be
aware
that
that
case
is
now
before
this
court
because
on
february
6
a
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
in
the
union
carbide
case.
earlier
developments
in
that
case
are
referred
to
in
briefs,
but
that
issue
is
presented
in
the
cert.
petition
filed
before
this
court
on
february
6th.
the
reason
why
there
is
such
a
direct
conflict
here
is
that
california
and
the
fed...
california
and
the
other
state
statutes
have
approached
antitrust
enforcement
in
diverse
separate
ways.
the
congress'
approach
as
explained
in
hanover
shoe,
hawaii
versus
standard
oil,
illinois
brick
and
numerous
other
decision
of
this
court,
is
a
balanced
deterrence
of
anticompetitive
conduct
through
a
range
of
enforcement
mechanisms,
including
injunctions,
criminal
penalties,
and
the
centerpiece
of
the
federal
antitrust
remedy,
the
treble
damages,
private
treble
damages
remedy.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
we
will
do
that
because
it's
important
to
address
the
specific
ways
in
which
the
state
statutes
affect
in
this
case
and
generally
the
federal
antitrust
remedy.
but
first
of
all,
if
i
may,
i
wanted
to
point
out
that
the...
as
this
court
has
interpreted
the
federal
legislation,
the
balanced
deterrents
compensates
victims
as
well
as
precluding
or
preventing
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
punishes
violaters,
but
the
court
has
repeatedly
held...
and
illinois
brick
is
one
of
those
cases...
hawaii
versus
standard
oil
is
another...
associated
general
contractors
is
a
third...
that
widening
the
circle
of
compensated
victims
is
not
a
permissible
objective
if
the
effect
of
widening
the
circle
of
compensated
victims
has
a
deleterious
effect
on
the
deterrent
remedy
of
the
direct
purchaser
provisions
of
the
federal
law.
by
the
same
token,
if
we...
if
a
mechanism
enhances
the
punishment
of
the
violater,
that
is
not
permissible,
according
to
this
court,
if
it
imposes
multiple
or
duplicative
recovery
under
the
antitrust
laws,
as
this
court
repeatedly
held...
has
held
in
the
same
cases
that
i've
referred
to
before.
the
states,
on
the
other
hand,
are
primarily
virtually
exclusively
interested
in
compensating
victims.
and,
in
doing
so,
has
expanded
the
circle
of
people
who
may
bring
lawsuits
under
the
antitrust
laws
in
ways
which
have
a
direct
and
harmful
effect
on
the
federal
remedy.
the
three
things
mentioned
by
this
court
in
illinois
brick...
i
think
that
it
is
responsive
to
your
question,
chief
justice
rehnquist...
are
the
complexities,
the
dilution
of
the
federal
recovery--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
in
this
case,
specifically,
there
is
an
express
amount
of
money,
based
upon
settlements.
if
the
indirect
purchasers
participate
in
this
litigation,
the
direct
purchasers
will
get
less
money.
my
client...
i'm
one...
my
client
is
a
direct
purchaser...
will
get
less
of
a
settlement
fund
and
its
recovery
under
the
federal
antitrust
laws
will
be
diluted
because
of
participation
by
the
indirect
purchasers.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
correct.
i
should
have
made
it
clear
when
i
stood
up
to
speak
that
i
represent
in
this
case
a
direct
purchaser.
we
are
challenging
the
state
statutes
because
those
state
statutes
authorize
in
this
case
the
amount
of
my
client's
recovery,
the
diminution
of
my
client's
recovery.
in
fact,
by
a
very
substantial
amount,
because
the
state...
although
the
amount
of
the
claims
has
not
yet
been
determined
because
of
this
process
that's
been
going
on
for
13
years,
if
we...
if
this
court
overturns
the
ninth
circuit,
we
will
go
back
to
the
district
court
for
long,
complicated
pass-on
litigation
of
exactly
the
same
variety
that
was
described
by
this
court
in
illinois
brick,
and
that
this
13-year
ordeal
will
go
on
for
i
don't
know
how
much
longer.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
there
were
seven,
i
believe.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i
submit,
justice
white,
that
that
is...
it's
a
very
interesting
point.
there
are
very
few
defendants
out
there
in
the
real
world
who
are
going
to
settle
with
just
the
direct
purchasers
or
just
the
federal
claims
because
you
are
going
to
be
facing
state
litigation--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--perhaps
california
litigation,
perhaps
arizona
litigation,
perhaps
alabama
litigation,
perhaps
minnesota
litigation,
and
each
one
of
those
statutes
are
different
and
provide
different
measures
of
recovery
for
different
indirect
purchasers.
the
minnesota
statute
has
this
provision
that
the
appellants
have
pointed
out
to
discourage
the
courts
from
allowing
duplicative
recovery,
but
the
california
statute
doesn't
have
any
such
provision.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
my
client
was
an
unnamed
class
member
who
came
in
to
participate
in
this
settlement.
there
are
direct
participants
in
the
settlement,
in
the
various
different
settlements
and
there
are
class
members
that
have
come
in.
this
case
is
perhaps
a
prototype
of
some
of
the
things
that
your
opinion--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--there
were
three
classes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
it
started
out
that
way.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
there
are
some
problems
with
respect
to
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
problems
are
even
greater
than
that,
justice
white,
because
my
client,
in
addition
to
being
a
direct
purchaser,
also
happens
to
be
an
indirect
purchaser.
we
are
here
today,
of
course,
objecting
to
the
decision
in...
i
mean
supporting
the
decision
because
our
interest
in
this
case
is
substantially
greater
as
a
direct
purchaser.
but
the
state
of
california
was
a
direct
purchaser
and
an
indirect
purchaser,
and
that's
the
way
it's
going
to
be
in
much
antitrust
litigation.
the...
the
point
of
the
complexities
that
this
court
talked
about
in
its
decision
in
illinois
brick
is
graphically
illustrated
by
this
kind
of
antitrust
litigation.
this
was
a
so-called
nationwide
conspiracy
to
violate
the
antitrust
laws.
there
are
many,
many,
many
claimants
that
have
filed
claims
pursuant
to
these
settlements.
there
were
several
different
district
court
proceedings
that
were
involved
and
brought
into
this
case.
the
complexities
that
you
described
for
the
court
in
illinois
brick
as
insurmountable
and
unmanageable
and
insuperable
are
squared,
if
anything,
when
you
add
in,
to
this
litigation,
the
participation
of
indirect
purchasers
under
state
indirect
purchaser
statutes
of
the
nature
that
are
involved
in
this
litigation.
and
there
is
no
way
to
avoid
those
complexities.
there
will
be
multiple
inconsistent
state
laws,
multiple
inconsistent
litigation,
possible
conflicts
among
the
various
state
laws.
these
cases
will
inevitably,
in
most
cases,
be
litigated
in
the
federal
courts
because
of
diversity
litigation
or
because
there's
a
crossover
between
the
indirect
and
the
direct
purchasers
if
they
are
not.
and
pendent
jurisdiction
is
particularly
appropriate
under
the
standards
established
by
this
court
for
pendent
jurisdiction.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
very
seldom
are
these
state
or
these
antitrust
cases
one
plaintiff--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
seems
to
me
that
the
argument
is
very
strong
because
this
court
determined
that
the...
the
practical
effect
of
indirect
purchaser
litigation,
wherever
it
exists
to
the
extent
that
it
influences
at
all
the
state
court
proceeding,
is
going
to
lengthen
that
process,
make
it
more
complicated,
make
it
less
attractive
for
participation
by
direct
purchasers,
will
almost
invariably
reduce
the
potential
recovery
by
the
direct
purchasers
because
you're
going
to
have
complete...
competing
claimants
for
the
same
fund,
and
you
have
on
the
defendants'
side
of
this
the
possibility
of
multiple
or
duplicative
recoveries.
now,
this
court
specifically
said
that
the
complexity
in
illinois
brick...
that
the
complexities
and
complications
that
were
described
in
illinois
brick
won't
be
the
same
in
every
case,
but
they
are
very
severe
in
this
case,
the
case
that
brings
this
problem
to
this
court--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
that's
a
very
good
point.
it
is
impossible
to
tell.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well...
well,
if
the
court
adheres
to
its
decision
in
hanover
shoe
and
illinois
brick,
you
may
have
a
less...
you
may
eliminate
the
problem
of
complexities--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that
the
litigation
brings
about.
but
no
matter
how
simple
it
is,
if
illinois...
if
hanover
show
remains
the
law
and
illinois
brick
remains
the
law,
then
the
direct
purchasers
were
damaged
the
moment
they
paid
the
overcharge.
therefore,
they
are
entitled
to
100
percent
trebled
of
the
recovery.
and
if
there
is
any
direct
purchaser
participation,
they
will
be
competing
for
the
same...
for
money
from
the
defendant.
that
will
mean
that
invariably
there
will
be
duplicative
and
multiple
recoveries.
and
as
i
understand
the
teachings
of
this
court
in
case
after
case,
it
is
a
very
significant
concern
of
this
court
that
there
not
be
duplicative
and
multiple
recoveries
under
the
antitrust
law.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
if...
no,
i
respectfully
submit
that
if
the...
if
the
case
proceeds
to
judgment
under
hanover
shoe
and
illinois
brick,
the
direct
purchasers
are
damaged
to
the
full
extent
of
the
overcharge.
whether
they
passed
it
on
or
not.
if
they
didn't
pass
it
on,
there
may
not
be
any
subsequent
recovery
by
any
of
the
indirect
purchasers,
but
the
appellants
brief
recites
people
who
have
written
law
review
articles
and
economists
who
say
that
passing
on
is
the
rule
and
not
the
exception.
there
are
almost
always,
according
to
the
appellants,
be
a
pass-on.
if
there's
a
pass-on,
then
there
are
indirect
purchasers
who
are
going
to
be
claiming
multiple
recoveries.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
state...
the
state
can
grant
additional
relief,
i
submit,
when
that
additional
relief
does
not
create
an
obstacle
to
the
effect
of
enforcement
of
the
federal
statute
or
an
obstacle
to
the
achievement
of
the
federal
goals.
in
this
case,
the
additional
relief
that
the
state
is
granting
is
the
right
to
participate
and
make
more
complicated--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--there's
three
answers
to
that.
in
the
first
place,
as
i
understand
illinois
brick,
that
is
precisely
the
scenario
that
the
court
was
concerned
about
in
illinois
brick,
a
large
piece
of
litigation,
although
that
case
did
go
to
a
settlement
where
there
are
conflicting
claimants
involving
complicated
insuperable
problems
in
terms
of
proving
the
amount
of
the
pass-on.
there's
not
an
answer
to
say
that
there
simply
should
be
a
denial
by
the
district
courts
of
pendent
jurisdiction
in
those
cases
because
the
district
courts
won't
be
able
to
deny
the
existence
of
the
litigation
in
diversity
cases
in
the
first
place.
in
the
second
place,
as
i
understand
this
court's
decision
in
united
mine
workers
versus
gibbs,
the
very
reason...
all
of
the
reasons
for
pendent
jurisdiction
come
to
play
in
this
case.
the
defendant--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--we
are
not
seeking
pendent
jurisdiction
or
seeking...
we're
not
seeking
to
have
it
both
ways.
i'm
simply
saying
that
the
court...
if
the
court...
if
the
district
courts
follow
the
guidelines
established
by
this
court
for
whether
or
not
to
grant
pendent
jurisdiction,
the
court
will
consider
that
the
defendants...
and
i'm
not
representing
a
defendant...
the
defendants
will
be
interested
in
pendent
jurisdiction
because
it
will
otherwise
have
completing...
competing
tandem
pieces
of
litigation--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
if
there's
a...
if
the
state
of
california
statute,
for
example,
is
constitutional--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--you
mean
in
the
federal
court?
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
why.
i
must
be
missing
a
part
of
your
question.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
right.
if...
they
will
not
recover
if
they're
preempted.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that
is...
that
is
the
result.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
if...
the
problem
that
one
of
the
questions
related
to
is...
the
question
that
was
raised
by
one
of
the
questions
is
what
if
the
indirect
purchaser
litigation
is
confined
over
here
to
the
state
court
and
the
direct
purchasers
are
allowed
to
proceed,
assuming
that
there's
no
identify
as
there
often
will
be
between
the
direct
and
indirect
purchasers.
and
i'm
saying
that
it
seems
obvious
to
me
that
the
litigation
will
nonetheless
be
complicated
and
this
is
what
will
happen.
there
will
be
in
the
first
place
multiple
litigation
going
on
at
the
same
time,
which
will--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
i'm...
i
must
be
missing--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i'm
trying
to
give
you
a
reason
why
we
should
win
here,
and
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
should
win
here
in
response
to
another
question,
was
that
the
litigation
does
not
become
more
simple
if
the
indirect
purchasers
are
confined
to
state
court
litigation
because
you
have
multiple
simultaneous
litigation
going
on.
you
have
an
almost
impossible
situation
with
respect
to
settling
the
litigation.
you
have
simultaneous
two
ring
circuses
full
of
discovery
and...
and...
and
you
have
a
race
to
the
judgment
because
the
defendant
presumably
will
only
have
limited
funds,
and
that
funds
will
be
available
first
of
all
to
the
first
person
to
get
there.
you
have
the
risk
of
inconsistent
factual
and
legal
adjudications
in
the
federal
forum
and
the
state
forum.
so,
no
matter
what
happens,
if
these
laws
are
not
preempted,
the
complications
that
the
court
was
concerned
about
in
illinois
brick
are,
if
anything,
worse
under
state
indirect
purchaser
litigation
than
in
the
federal
litigation.
furthermore,
the
other
problem,
the
dilution
of
the
recovery,
the
part
one
of
the
illinois
brick
formulation
was
the
complexities
that
indirect
purchaser
litigation
would
bring
to
the
table.
and
as
i've
pointed
out,
state
legislation
makes
the
problem
even
worse.
the
dilution
that
the
court
was
concerned
about
of
recoveries
is
every
bit
as
great
if
not
more
great.
here,
for
example,
we
have
the
absolute
certainty
of
dilution
if
indirect
purchasers
participate.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
only
because
of
the...
well,
it's
because
of
the
settlement
in
this
case.
if
there
isn't
a
settlement,
it
will
be
possibly
more
difficult
to
settle
the
litigation
at
all,
which
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
policy
that
this
court
has
encouraged
and
is
a
part
if
antitrust--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--there
will
be
dilution
depending
upon
the
amount
of
the
assets
of
the
defendant.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
if
you
have
and
if
you
assume...
and
i
don't
think
that
that's
necessarily
something
that
this
court
ought
to
assume...
in
multiple
complicated
nationwide
antitrust
litigation
where
you're
already
talking
about
treble
damages
and
you're
already
talking
about
a
case
which
is
in
this
one...
and
this
case
lasted
13
years
and
will
probably
go
on
for
another
decade...
the
resources
that
are
drawn
down
from
the
defendant
as
a
result
of
simple
participating
in
the
litigation.
yes,
you
may
have
some
defendants
that
can
afford
that
and
then
treble
damages
on
top
of
it
and
then
possible
sextuple
or
rinetuple
damages
because
under
the
state
statutes,
for
example
california's,
it's
not
clear
that
the
rule
of
hanover
shoe,
the
pass-on
might
not
be
applied
unequally.
in
other
words,
there
may
be
100
percent
recovery,
as
there
must
be
under
illinois
brick
and
hanover
shoe
at
the
direct
purchaser
level.
there
may
be
if...
if
all
of
the
overcharge
was
passed
on,
there
may
be
to
the
first
tier
of
indirect
purchasers,
there
may
be
another
100
percent
recovery
trebled.
there
may
be
a
third
tier
and
a
fourth
tier
and
a
fifth
tier.
that
may
not
always
be
the
case,
but
it's
potentially
the
case.
if...
if
the
pass-on
is
not
handled
equally,
as
this
court
put
it
in
illinois
brick,
that's
very
much
the
potential.
so,
in
those
kind
of
cases,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
there
is
a
very
strong
possibility
of
a
dilution
of
recovery
by
the
direct
purchasers.
and,
what
there
will
be
for
certain...
and
i've
alluded
to
this...
is
that
there
will
be
multiple
duplicative
recoveries,
almost
invariably,
because
we
know
under
hanover
shoe
and
illinois
brick
and
direct
purchasers
have
got
to
recover
treble
damages
times
the
entire
amount
of
the
overcharge.
so
that
any
recovery
by
any
indirect
purchaser
is
going
to
be
an
additional
recovery
for
the
same
overcharge.
and
that,
as
i
understand
it,
is
a
policy
that's
strongly
frowned
upon
under
the
antitrust
laws
by
the
teachings
of
this
court
in
hawaii
versus
standard
oil
and
various
other
cases.
thus,
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
concern
of
the
effect
of
the
indirect
purchaser
remedy
on
federal
antitrust
litigation
is
every
bit
as
great,
if
not
more
great
in
the
state
when
the
law...
when
the...
the
litigation
is
authorized
by
state
law
as
it
is...
as
it
would
be
if
it
was
authorized
by
federal
law.
now,
the
question
is
does
that
bring
about
a
preemption
in
the
operation
of
the
supremacy
clause.
we
submit
that
it
most
clearly
does.
in
the
first
place,
this
court
has
repeatedly...
and
there's
no
question...
in
this
litigation
that
the
standard
for
preemption
that
we're
talking
about
in
this
case
is
obstacle
preemption.
whether
or
not
the
state
law...
and
there
was
some
discussion
when
mr.
greene
was
speaking
about
separate
sovereign
and
a
separate
state
remedy
under
a
separate
sovereign.
there's
always,
of
course,
going
to
be
a
separate
sovereign
when
we're
talking
about
preemption.
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
where
the
state
law
provides
an
obstacle
to
the
accomplishment
and
execution
of
the
full
purposes
and
objectives
of
congress,
then
there
will
be
preemption.
recently
this
court
held
in
international
paper
versus
aulette
that
the
state
law
is
also
preempted
if
it
interferes
with
the
methods
by
which
the
federal
statute
was
designed
to
achieve
its
goal.
in
that
case,
the
clean
water
act
was
involved,
and
in
response
to
a
point
that
mr.
greene
made,
there's
always
the
possibility
or
there's
frequently
the
possibility
that
the
states
may
argue
that
we're
seeking
to
accomplish
the
same
goals.
the
litigants
in
that
case
made
the
same
point
in
international
paper
versus
aulette.
we're
seeking
to
accomplish
the
same
goal.
nonetheless
the
court
held
that
because
the
state
remedy
interfered
with
the
effectiveness
of
the
federal
remedy,
the
state
statute
was
preempted.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
believe
we're
helped
by
that.
i
believe
that
we're
also
helped
by
your
very
recent
opinion
in
wisconsin
public
industry
versus
gould
i
believe
it
was
in
which
a
state
court...
a
state
statute
there
debarred
a
contractor
if
it
had
violated
federal
labor
law
on
three
separate
occasions,
and
it
was
the
unanimous
opinion
of
the
court
in
that
case
that
the
statute
was
preempted.
with
respect
to
the
boyle
case,
i
think
the
same...
some
of
the
same
considerations
apply,
although
we're
talking
about
the...
a
federal
statute
here
and
the
federal
common
law
in
the
boyle
case.
but
i
think
that
the...
much
of
the
teachings
of
that
case
in
terms
of
the
analytical
process
of
considering
the
effect
of
the
state
statute
on
the
federal
concern
is
very
much
apropos.
the
illinois
brick
concerns,
contrary
to
what
my
opponents
have
said,
are
the
concerns
of
congress.
my
opponents
have
repeatedly
said
in
their
briefs
and
even
here
today,
that
what
the
court
was
talking
about
in
illinois
brick
was
something
removed
from
congressional
concerns,
something
on
the
order
of
jurisprudential
concerns
for
the
efficiency
of
litigation
in
the
courts.
but,
as
i
go
back
and
examine
the
decision
in
hanover
shoe
and
illinois
brick,
it's
very
clear
that
the
court
there
was
articulating
what
congressional
policies
are,
and
it
is
the
law,
of
course,
of
the
land,
as
this
court
has
explained
it,
that
those
are
congressional
policies
which
are
being
undermined.
in...
it
is
interesting...
and
this
is...
i
draw
this
from
a
footnote
in
the
associated
general
contractors
case...
senator
edmunds
during
the
debates
that
led
to
the
enactment
of
the
sherman
act
specifically
said
if
we
want
to
entangle
this
legislation
and
make
it
difficult
for
it
every
to
accomplish
its
objectives...
and
i'm
not
quoting,
i'm
paraphrasing...
one
of
the
ways
in
which
we
could
do
it
is
to
invite
everybody
into
the
litigation,
allow
any
party
to
participate
in
the
litigation,
and
that
will
bring
about
the
collapse
of
the
remedy.
that's
precisely
what
has
happened
here.
as
we've
said
the
indirect
purchaser
litigation
is
a
mechanism
that
as
a
matter
of
law
substantially
impairs
the
effectiveness
of
the
private
treble
damage
remedy.
state
remedies
would
be
even
worse.
they
would
be
more
complex.
they
would
bring
about
certain
dilution
of
the
recovery
of
direct
purchasers
in
many
cases,
and
the
risk
of
dilution
in
other
cases.
and
it's
the
risk
that
should
be
of
greatest
concern
because
the
risk
of
dilution
of
the
recovery
will
be
what
deters
the
direct
purchaser
from
bringing
the
antitrust
remedy
at
all.
and
there
will
be
a
certainty
of
multiple
overlapping
recovery.
for
all
of
these
reasons,
the
indirect
purchaser
legislation
provides
serious
obstacles
to
the
effectiveness
of
the
enforcement
of
the
direct
purchaser
remedy
under
the
antitrust
laws
and
is
preempted.
