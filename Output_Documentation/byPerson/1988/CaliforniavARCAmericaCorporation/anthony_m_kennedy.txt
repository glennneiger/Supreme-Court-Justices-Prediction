justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
case--
--and
even
in
the
fact
of
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion?
if
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
remained
the
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
could
still
have
a
state
claim
for
indirect
purchaser
damages...
or
did
that
opinion--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--purport
to
preempt
that
as
well.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
this
case
or
in
any
case,
if
there's
a
limited
amount
of
funds
because,
say,
the
defendant
is
judgment
proof
beyond
a
certain
point,
do
the
direct
purchasers
have
first
claim
under
federal
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
it
were
true
that
indirect
purchasers
recover,
i
suppose
you
could
argue
in
a
case
where
the
defendant
has
limited
assets
that
that
would
discourage
federal
suits
by
a
direct
purchaser?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
your
authority
for
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
the
state
just
said
then
six
times.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
suppose...
i
suppose
if
the
settlement
had
been
clear
or
the
settlements...
were
there
more
than
one?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
settlements
had
been
clear
that
they
were
only
settling
the
federal
law
issue,
why--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
your...
was
your
client
party
to
a
settlement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose
there
should
have
been
really
should
have
been
two
classes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
should
be
at
least
a
class
of
direct
purchasers
and
a
class
of
indirect
purchasers.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
helped
at
all,
mr.
olson,
by
our
opinion
in
boyle
versus
united
technologies.
