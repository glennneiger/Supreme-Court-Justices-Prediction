justice
kennedy
i
take
it
the
parties
could
have
stipulated
to
have
the
magistrate
select
the
jury?
justice
kennedy
so
then
it's
not
necessary
for
the
validity
of
a
criminal
trial
for
the
district
judge
just
to
be
there?
justice
kennedy
now,
in
this
case
there
was
no
particular
decision
that
the
defendants
complained
of?
there
was
no...
there
was
no
challenge
they
made
that
was
not
accepted?
there
was
no
instruction
given
that
they
objected
to?
there
were
no
further
instructions
requested?
justice
kennedy
but
that
objection
was
not...
that
matter
was
not
renewed
before
the
district
court?
justice
kennedy
i
don't
see
how
that's
the
case
in
the
federal
system
when
the
presiding
judge
or
the
magistrate
does
the
voir
dire.
voir
dire
is
very
difficult.
justice
kennedy
do
you
think
that
trial
lawyers
would
say
that
there's
no
art
to
a
voir
dire
examination?
justice
kennedy
i
take
it
in
many
districts
in
complex
cases
there
are
written
questionnaires
that
are
the
beginning
of
the
process
and
magistrates
spend
a
considerable
amount
of
time
with
counsel
reviewing
the
answers
to
the
written
questionnaires?
justice
kennedy
i
take
it
that
that's
a
frequent
practice.
