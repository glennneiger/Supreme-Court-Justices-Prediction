justice
marshall
you
keep
talking
about
experiment.
that's
about
the
third
or
fourth
time.
well,
suppose
i
accept
your
view
and
say
the
experiment
is
wrong.
would
that
satisfy
you?
justice
marshall
to
be
an
experiment,
does
that
give
it
some
backing
or
does
it
mean
we
should
take
it
easy,
or
that
means
we
should
rubber
stamp
it?
what
does
it
mean?
justice
marshall
is
a
motion
to
suppress
a
pretrial
motion?
justice
marshall
the
average
dope
case,
if
you
lose
that
you
lose
the
case.
justice
marshall
i
was
waiting
for
you
to
emphasize
that.
justice
marshall
--is
it
not
true
that
some
criminal
convictions
have
been
reversed
solely
on
a
juror's
being
put
on
the
court
who
should
not
have
been
there?
witherspoon,
for
example.
justice
marshall
how
do
you
get
that
in
the
pretrial
category?
it
determined
the
case.
justice
marshall
how
about
death
penalty
cases?
justice
marshall
would
you
make
an
exception
for
death
penalty
cases
under
the
witherspoon
decision?
justice
marshall
you
don't...
in
other
words,
the
whole
importance
about
questioning
for
jurors
is
a
pretrial
matter,
even
if
it
involves
the
constitution
of
the
united
states?
justice
marshall
it...
i
did...
you
mean
the
magistrate
can
decide
it
and
then
you
rely
on
the
de
novo-point?
justice
marshall
and
that
is
saving
the
district
court
judge's
time?
justice
marshall
if
you
ask
the
juror,
is
he
under
21
and
he
says
yes,
that's
not
the
point
i'm
talking
about.
there
was
a
reason
for
the
trial
judge
picking
juries
from
go,
wasn't
there?
wasn't
there
a
reason
for
an
article
iii
judge
to
pick
juries
and
to
excuse
jurors?
there
was
a
reason
for
it.
