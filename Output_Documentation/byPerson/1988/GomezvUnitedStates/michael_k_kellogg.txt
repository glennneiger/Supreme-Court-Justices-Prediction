mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
designed
the
magistrates
act
to
help
district
court
judges
cope
with
their
overwhelming
case
loads.
congress
wrote
the
statute
in
broad
terms
and
specifically
stated
both
in
passing
and
in
amending
the
act
that
its
purpose
was
to
encourage
experimentation
in
the
use
of
magistrates
up
to
the
limits
of
article
iii
in
order
to
help
district
court
judges
dispense
justice
more
efficiently
and
expeditiously.
there
should
be
little
question
in
this
case
but
that
the
plain
terms
of
the
statute
permit
district
court
judges
to
delegate
jury
selection
to
magistrates.
technically
there
are
two
separate
provisions
of
the
act
which
permit
that
delegation.
first,
section
636(b)(1)
permits
district
court
judges
to
delegate
pretrial
matters
to
magistrates.
now,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
the
term
pretrial
is
subject
to
different
interpretations,
and
the
commencement
of
trial
has
been
fixed
at
different
points
for
different
purposes.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
not
really.
you
hear
challenges
for
cause.
you
determine
the
qualifications
of
jurors
in
the
same...
the
terminology
is
no
more
awkward
here
than
applied
to,
for
example,
the
issuance
of
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
testificandum
or
the
issuance
of
a
subpoena,
which
are
pretrial
matters
clearly
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
congress,
of
course,
anticipated
that
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
ambiguity
in
the
phrase,
pretrial
matters.
we
think
the
better
argument
is
that
jury
selection
is
logically
distinct
from
and
prior
to
the
trial
itself
for
this
purpose,
which
begins
with
the
swearing
in
of
the
jury,
introductory
arguments
and
presentation
of
evidence.
however,
congress
anticipated
the
ambiguity
and
therefore
provided
in
a
separate
subsection,
section
636
<b@l
three>
[=
(b)(3)],
that
magistrates
may
be
delegated
"such
additional
duties
as
are
not
inconsistent
with
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states.
"
congress
expressly
stated
in
both
the
house
and
senate
reports
that
the
purpose
of
this
provision
was
to
permit
district
courts
to
"experiment
in
the
assignment
of
other
duties
to
magistrates
which
may
not
necessarily
be
included
in
the
broad
category
of
pretrial
matters.
"
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
if
the
experiment
proves--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--well,
congress
specifically
provided
that
duties
may
not
be
delegated
to
the
extent
that
they
violate
the
constitution
or
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
if,
as
petitioners
suggest,
there's
a
constitutional
or
a
statutory
bar,
then
the
experiment
would
not
be
permitted.
but
merely
because
one
thinks
the
experiment
may
be
a
less
good
idea
or
a
bad
idea,
even,
is
not
sufficient
grounds
given
that
congress
has
expressly
authorized
it.
if
the
experiment
proves
unsuccessful,
if
magistrate
selection
of
juries
does
not
prove
to
save
much
time,
then
presumably
district
court
judges,
who
retain
absolute
discretion
over
whether
to
assign
the
matter
or
not
to
magistrates,
will
decide
not
to
do
so.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
we
don't
say
that
it
makes
all
the
rest
unnecessary.
for
example,
we
don't
suggest
that
the
additional
duties
clause
allows
magistrates
to
try
felony
cases.
congress
specifically
provided
in
the
act
that
magistrates
could
try
misdemeanors
and
civil
trials
with
the
consent
of
the
parties.
it
did
not
go
on
and
say
that
they
could
try
felony
cases
with
or
without
the
consent.
so
the
additional
duties
provision
does
not
make
superfluous
what
went
before,
either
in
terms
of
the
matters
that
can
be
heard
or
the
specific
standard
of
review.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
the
point
of
(b)(3)
was
to
pick
up
other
additional
matters
that
were
not
covered
in
the
broad
category
of
pretrial
matters,
to
permit
further
experimentation
in
innovative
ways
congress
might
not
even
have
anticipated.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
the
question
would
be
just
how
important
is
that
additional
responsibility.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
a
motion
to
suppress
is
a
pretrial
motion
specifically
covered
under
(b)(1).
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
it
is
ordinarily
a
case
dispositive
motion,
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
i
was...
i
was
planning
to.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
of
course
the
additional
duties
clause
does
not
specify
what
the
standard
of
review.
it's
left
to
the
district
court
judges
individually,
or
the
district
courts
as
a
whole
by
rule.
provision
(b)(4)
specifically
provides
that
the
local
courts
consent
rules
governing
matters
to
be
assigned,
standards--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--yes.
our
position
would
be
that
a
clearly
erroneous
or
contrary
to
law
standard
of
review
would
not
violate
either
the
statute
or
article
iii
in
this
instance.
however,
i
would
note
that
the
court
in
this
case
did
offer
de
novo
review.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
it's...
it's...
it's
not
particularly.
as
justice
marshall
pointed
out,
a
motion
to
suppress
is
frequently
case
dispositive.
there's
a
winner
and
a
loser.
jury
selection
by
contrast
is
not
a
zero
sum
gain.
the
key
role
in
jury
selection
is
not
played
by
the
court,
it's
played
by
the
parties,
and
both
sides,
as
in
this
case,
may
be
satisfied
with
the
jury
chosen.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
in
most
federal
courts,
i
believe
that
is
the
practice,
justice
o'connor.
the
two
most
important
aspects
of
jury
selection
from
the
perspective
of
the
defendant
are
first
to
get
biased
jurors
off
the
jury
through
challenges
for
cause,
and
second
to
try
to
get
as
favorable
a
jury
as
possible
through
the
intelligent
exercise
of
peremptory
challenges.
now,
the
role
of
the
presiding
official
in
both
those
respects
is,
in
fact,
largely
routine.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
the
voir
dire
is
very
important
in
the
sense
that
questions
have
to
be
asked
to
elicit
sufficient
responses
both
to
elicit
any
sort
of
bias
or...
and
to
give
the
parties
sufficient
understanding
of
the
jurors
to
exercise
their
peremptory
challenges
in
a...
in
a
intelligent
way.
now,
that's
a
matter
that's
fairly
easily
reviewable
by
the
district
court
judge.
in
many
federal
districts
the
practice
is
to
submit
your
proposed
voir
dire
questions
in
advance
to
the
court.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
no.
i
would
not
suggest
that
there's
no
art
to
eliciting
proper
responses,
but
then
there's
no
reason
to
suggest
that
magistrates
are
not
up
to
that
task.
the
act
itself
provides
substantial
requirements
to
ensure
the
competence
and
the
impartiality
of
magistrates.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
no,
51
of
the
91
federal
districts
expressly
provide
that
voir
dire
may
be
conducted
by
magistrates
without
any
limitation...
for
civil
cases,
criminal
cases.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
it's
not
my
understanding
that
that
consent
of
the
parties
is
required
in
most
cases.
i
don't
think
there
are
authoritative
statistics
on
that.
the
local
rules
do
not
require
it.
there
are
an
additional
18
district
courts
which
provide
that
magistrates
may
be
delegated
all
the
powers
and
duties
that
have
been
delegated
to
them
under
section--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--you're
asking
it
they
could?
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
yes,
i
believe
so.
it
is
a
frequent
practice
to
have
the
initial
voir
dire
conducted...
conducted
on
paper.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
what
we
mean
is,
additional
duties
not
specifically
covered
in
(b)(1).
so,
for
example,
you
can't...
(b)(1)
doesn't
become
superfluous.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
felony
trial
by
negative
implication
is
precluded
by
the
structure
of
the
rest
of
the
act,
because
the
act
specifically
provides
for
the
trial
of
misdemeanors
with
consent
and
the
trial
of
civil
cases
with
consent.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
i
think
that's
a
fair
reading.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
it's
not
inconsistent
with
what
we're
saying.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
because
there's
no
indication
that
congress
considered
jury
selection
to
be
part
of
the
felony
trial.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
i
wouldn't
concede
it
in
the
following
sense:
the
inquiry
under
(b)(1)
of
pretrial
draws
some
sort
of
line,
obviously,
at
which
point
the
trial
starts.
the
inquiry
under
(b)(3)
is
to
identify
whether
there's
a
sort
of
set
of
core
adjudicatory
functions
that
congress
intended
to
reserve
in
felony
cases
for
district
court
judges
to
perform
and
not
to
delegate
to
magistrates.
now,
for
example,
there
are
several
instances
of
matters
that
would
not
be
pretrial
matters
and
yet
would
not
fall
within
the
prohibition
on
the
conduct
of
felony
trials,
such
as
the
taking
of
a
jury
verdict.
congress
in
the
legislative
history
specifically
indicated
that
as
one
possible...
obviously
that's
a
trial
matter
in
one
sense.
it's
not
a
pretrial
matter
within
the
meaning
of
(b)(1)
and
yet
it
is
an
additional
duty
that
can
be
assigned
under
(b)(3).
similar
matters
would
be,
for
example,
if
a
discovery
dispute
were
to
arise
during
trial,
or
if
a
belated
motion
to
suppress
were
made
that
the
judge
decided
to
permit
despite
the
fact
that
it
was
belated.
he
could...
because
those
are
collateral
to
the
core
functions
of
the
trial...
assign
those
to
the
magistrate
under
the
act
and
within--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--well,
this
court
in
raddatz
made
clear
that
the
act
permits
the
delegation
of
suppression
hearings
to
magistrates
under
the...
under
the
pretrial
provisions.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
the
mere
fact
that
it
arises...
happens
to
arise
late
and
during
trial
does
not
make
it
part
of
the
core
functions
that...
that
congress
was
not
going
to
allow
judges
to
delegate
to
magistrates.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
correct.
if
there
was
a
biased--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--the
selection
process
of
the
juror,
if
a
challenge
for
cause
is
not
sustained...
that
should
have
been
sustained...
and
a
biased
juror
sits
on
the
jury,
then
that
can
be
grounds
for
overturning
the
conviction.
but
most
challenges
for
cause,
i
should
stress,
are
fairly
routine.
as
we
show
at
page
34
in
our
brief,
they
involve
mainly
people
asking,
can
you
be
fair
in
this
sort
of
case;
and
the
juror...
prospective
juror...
who
doesn't
really
want
to
be
there,
says
no
and
is
then
excused
for
cause.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
pardon?
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
there
is
at
the
moment,
so
far
as
i
understand,
no
death
penalty
in
federal
court
cases
and
therefore
the
issue
would
never
arise.
now,
it
is
true
that
the
witherspoon
inquiry
is
very
difficult.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
if
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
have
a
particular
juror
excused
because
of
some
statement
of
bias
or
partially,
certainly
that
is
a
matter
not
only
that
the
magistrate
can
handle,
but
it
is
also
subject
to
review
by
the
district
court
judge.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
certainly
challenges
for
cause
can
be
reviewed
by
the
district
court
judge.
in
most
cases,
as
i
say--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--well,
it
certainly
could
well,
because
disputes
will
not
arise
in
the
run-of-the-mind
cases.
in
this
case,
for
example,
they
did
not
arise
either.
no
one
had
any
objections
to
any
of
the
jurors
excused
for
cause.
we
quote,
actually,
from
the
colloquies
on
page
34
of
our
brief
in
which
the
juror
said,
quite
frankly,
no,
i
couldn't
be
fair,
and
it's
clear
in
those
circumstances
that
the
juror
has
to
be
excused.
now,
there
are
some
slightly
more
complicated
cases
in
which,
for
example,
one
of
the
jurors--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--it's
not
altogether
clear
just
what
the
requirements
of
article
iii
are,
justice
marshall.
this
court's
cases
indicate
that
there
are
two
principal
concerns
underlying
this
aspect
of
article
iii.
first
of
all,
there's
the
institutional
concern
about
protecting
the
judiciary
from
encroachments
on
or
erosions
by
other
branches
of
government.
second,
there's
the
personal
right
of
litigants
to
trial
before
an
article
iii
judge.
now,
the
first
concern
is
simply
not
present
in
this
case.
the
magistrate
is
an
adjunct
of
the
district
court,
not
an
independent
article
i
judge
of
the
sort
the
court
dealt
with
in
northern
pipeline.
he's
appointed
by
district
court
judges,
subject
to
removal
by
district
court
judges
and
all
matters
assigned
to
magistrates
are
assigned
by
the
district
court
judges.
the
magistrate,
therefore,
is
fully
integrated
into
the
judicial
branch.
now,
the
personal
right
of
litigants
is
satisfied
by
the
fact
that
the
trial
proper
is
in
fact
conducted
by
the
article
iii
judge.
jury
selection
is
admittedly
an
important
proceeding,
but
it's
not
part
of
the
competing
presentation
of
facts
that's
ordinarily
considered
to
constitute
the
trial
proper.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
he
could,
depending
on
the
circumstances.
it's
totally
up
to
him
how
he
would
want
to
do
it.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
he
could
question
the
jury
himself,
if
he
wanted
to.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
certainly
true,
but
not
nearly
so
much,
i
would
assume,
as
in
a
suppression
hearing
where
you
have
a
credibility
argument...
two
witnesses
arguing
back
and
forth...
and
the
court
has
already
said
that
there's
no
objection
to
having
the
magistrate
decide
the
case
as
an
initial
matter
and
for
the
judge
to
exercise
de
novo
review,
based
on
a
reading
of
the
transcript.
there's
no
requirement
that
he
hear
the
witnesses.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that
i
don't
know
about,
justice
stevens.
i...
i
hadn't
thought
of
it
and
i
don't
have
any
statistics.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
i
suspect
it
would
be
a
rare
instance.
it
is...
i
don't
mean
to
denigrate
the
importance
of
jury
selection
at
all.
it
is
very
important
in
the
two
respects
i
mentioned,
of
getting
biased
jurors
off
the
jury
and
exercising
your
peremptories
in
an
intelligent
way.
now,
both
those
aspects...
the
presiding
official's
role
in
both
those
aspects
is
easily
reviewable
by
the
district
court
judge.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
that's
true.
to
the
extent
that
the
lawyers
are
doing
it,
of
course,
there's
no
problem
with
the
magistrate
there.
i
would
point
out
that
there's
no
article
iii
requirement
that
the
same
judge
pick
the
jury
as
tries
the
case,
so
any...
there
may
well
be
marginal
benefits
to
having
somebody
with
continuity
the
entire
way
through,
but
article
iii
does
not
require
it.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
i'd
be
happy
to
address
that
if
you
wish,
right
now.
i
would
hope
the
court
never
has
to
reach
it,
but
the
point
would
be
that
unlike
other
cases...
unlike,
for
example,
cases
involving
racial
bias
or
failure
to
open
trial
proceedings,
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
there
is
some
overriding
policy
objective
that
requires
reversal
of
the
conviction.
nor
is
this
a
case
where
there
might
be
a
hidden
error,
as
for
example
where
a
judge
turns
out
to
have
a
conflict
of
interest
or
where
a
defendant
is
not
represented
by
counsel.
in
this
case,
without
overriding
policy
objectives
we
can
be
very
confident
of
the
fact
that
the
defendants
were
not
prejudiced
in
any
way
by
the
selection
of
the
jury
by
the
magistrate.
they
were
tried
and
convicted
by
an
acknowledged
impartial
jury
before
an
article
iii
judge.
the
fact
that
a
magistrate
conducted
the
initial
proceeding
of
selecting
the
jury
would
not
seem
to
warrant,
even
assuming
the
court
were
to
decide
that
it
violated
article
iii
or
the
statute--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--well,
i
don't
think
we
would
try
to
make
the
argument
in
that
instance,
because
that
would
be
the
entire
proceeding.
here
we
have
a
discrete
portion
of
the
proceeding
which
has
never
been
identified
it
had
any
adverse
effect
on
the
defendants.
there's
no
allegations
that
any
of
the
questions
asked
by
the
magistrate
were
improper,
that
any
challenges
for
cause
should
have
been
sustained
that
were
not,
or
that
there
was
a
problem
with
the
exercise
of
peremptory--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--it's
a
question
of
degree.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
but
the
trial
proper
we
would
say
it
was
conducted
by
an
article
iii
judge.
one
final
point
that
i
want
to
make
in
response
to
petitioners,
this
is
not
simply
a
matter
of
convenience.
in
the
southern
district
of
florida,
the
average
district
court
judge
tries
50
trials
a
year.
now,
obviously
that's
going
to
be
impossible
unless
the
transition
from
trial
to
trial
is
a
fairly
smooth
one.
the
venire
for
the
next
trial
has
to
be
ready
upon
the
close
of
the
last
one,
but
it's
impossible
to
anticipate
in
all
cases
when
a
particular
trial
is
going
to
end,
so
if
your
trial
carries
over
you
have
a
venire
sitting
there
and
you
either
have
a
choice
of
interrupting
your
trial
to
pick
the
jury
for
the
next
one,
or
else
having
the
venire
sit
there
while
you
conclude
the
prior
trial.
obviously,
the
problem
is
further
complicated
if
speedy
trial
act
constraints
require
the
selection
of
the
jury
to
begin
on
a
certain
date.
now,
if
magistrates
can
pick
juries,
the
district
judge
can
finish
his
trial
while
the
stage
is
being
set
for
the
next
one
and
the
transition
will
be
smooth
without
wasted
time
for
the
judge,
the
jury
or
the
parties.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
no,
not
frivolous,
but
not
very
substantial.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
not
after
raddatz.
this
case
is
really
a
fortiori
from
raddatz.
raddatz
involved
a
case
dispositive
suppression
motion.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
the
statute
itself
provides
for
additional
duties
up
to
the
limit
of
article
iii.
it
says
additional
duties
not
inconsistent
with
the
constitutional
laws
of
the
united
states,
so
you
can't
really
construe
the
statute--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--it
would
be
very
difficult
to
do
that
given
that
congress
has
said,
we
want
this
interpreted
up
to
the
limits
of
what's
provided
by
the
constitution.
in
any
event,
we
don't
think
that
the
article
iii
issue
is
so
substantial
as
to
require...
as
to
require
the
court
to
strain
in
its
interpretation
of
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions--
