justice
stevens
mr.
kellogg,
at
one
point
in
your
argument
you
started
to
stress...
or,
i
understood
you
to
start
to
make
an
argument
based
on
the
relative
importance
of
this
part
of
the
whole
process
and
suggested
it
was
less
important
than
the...
than
the
main
event
that
starts
after
the
jury's
selected.
are
there
any
statistics,
or
do
you
have
any
information
about
how
often
trial
counsel
delegates
the
job
of
jury
selection
to
their
associates
and
they
don't
bother
sitting
in?
justice
stevens
my
impression
is
trial
counsel
consider
it
rather
important.
justice
stevens
that's
true.
but
the
thing
that's
really
not
reviewable
and
can't
always
be
recaptured
is
the
atmosphere
at
the
beginning
of
what
a
lot
of
people
think
is
the
process
that
the
defendant
is
being
subjected
to.
there
is
an
element
of...
the
lawyers
really
try
to
create
something
that's
going
to
persevere
throughout
the
trial
by
the
way
they
question
not
only
those
who
are
excused,
but
those
who
remain
on
the
jury.
