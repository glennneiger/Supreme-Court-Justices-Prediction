chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
88-5014,
jose
gomez
v.
the
united
states
and
number
88-5158,
diego
chavez-tesina
v.
the
united
states.
chief
justice
rehnquist
when
you
get
down
to
it,
mr.
rudin,
a
judge
presiding
at
a
felony
trial
can
sit
there
for
a
couple
of
hours
and
he
may
make
a
couple...
maybe
a
ruling
or
two
sustaining
an
objection
to
evidence.
it
isn't
the
most
demanding
part
of
the
judge's
role,
certainly.
it
may
have
a
figurative
aspect.
chief
justice
rehnquist
no.
i
mean
just
during
the...
the...
course
of
a
felony
trial
itself.
the
idea
that
that
is
somehow
the
apogei
of
judging
is...
is
more
form
than
substance,
i
think.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i'm
not
suggesting
that
a
criminal
trial
isn't
of
the
most
extraordinary
importance
to
the
defendant
and
to
the
state
too.
but
i'm...
i...
if
i
got
from
your
remarks
the
feeling
that
somehow
the
ultimate
test
of
how...
how
sound
a
judge
is
is
the
performance
during
a
criminal
trial,
i'm
not
sure
i
agree
with
that.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
i
think
a
district
judge
is
called
upon
for
many
more
intellectually
demanding
tasks
than
can
frequently
occur
during
periods
of
a
criminal
trial,
when
the
judge
just
isn't
called
upon
the
to
do
much.
chief
justice
rehnquist
on
an
instant
of
de
novo
review
of
the
prisoner
there
wouldn't
be
a
whole
lot
more
than
that
to
be
challenged,
would
there?
chief
justice
rehnquist
like
what?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
that's
a
form
of
challenge.
what...
what
else,
other
than
challenge
to
the
seating
of
the
jurors
would
be
reviewed
de
novo,
would
a
defendant
want
reviewed
de
novo?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
do
you
do
if
you
think
they're
not
candid?
i
mean,
supposing
you
go
round
and
round
with
a
juror,
i
suspect
you
don't
go
around
too
long
about
whether
he
accepts
the
presumption
of
innocence
because
he
says
he
does.
all
you
can
is
that
you're
not
being
candid.
well,
how
much
can
you
make
of
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
rudin.
mr.
kellogg?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it's
a
little
strange,
i
think,
mr.
kellogg
for
congress
to
have
been
quite
precise
in
the
other
section
of
the
act
saying
what
magistrates
can
do
by
themselves,
what
they
can
do
with
de
novo
review,
and
then
have
a
catch-all
provision
which
really
would
make
all
the
rest
unnecessary,
as
interpreted
by
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
how...
how
about
the
provision
authorizing
a
judge
to
designate
a
magistrate
to
hear
and
determine
any
pretrial
matters
pending
before
the
court?
now,
certainly
(b)(3)
would
authorize
that
without
the
specific
language
of
the
earlier
section,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
isn't
there
some
sort
of
a
ustem
generis
principle
working
here
that
if
congress
has
specified
these
several
things
it
would
be
unusual
for
still
a
larger
thing...
or
what
many
people
would
think
is
even
a
more
important
responsibility,
to
be
found
in
a
catch-all
clause?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--would
a
motion
to
suppress
be
collateral
to
the
core?
it's
basically
an
objection
to
the
admission
of
evidence.
that's
what
happens
at
trial
all
the
time.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that's
quite
correct,
but--
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
district
judge,
if
he
reviews
de
novo,
reviews
on
the
transcript?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you
still
lose
some
of
the
nuances
that
happened
the
first
time
the
question
arose.
chief
justice
rehnquist
of
course,
you
could
make
roughly
the
same
argument
if
a
magistrate
had
sat
up
there
and
tried
the
whole
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you
mr.
kellogg.
mr.
rudin,
you
have
one
minute
left.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rudin.
the
case
is
submitted.
