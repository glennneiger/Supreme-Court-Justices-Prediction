justice
white
do
you
think
the
constitutional
issue
in
this
case
is
just
frivolous,
is
that
it?
justice
white
substantial?
if
it's
a
substantial
issue,
you
certainly
don't
argue
it.
justice
white
so
you
don't
think
there's
a
serious
enough
constitutional
question
to
affect
how
you
construe
the
statute?
justice
white
i
know.
that
really
doesn't
answer
my
question.
if
there
were
a
serious
constitutional
question
you
might
just
avoid
it
by
limiting
the
reach
of
that
such
other
duties.
