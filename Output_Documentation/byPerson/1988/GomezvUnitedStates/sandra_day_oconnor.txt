justice
o'connor
counsel,
the
court
did
uphold
the
use
of
the
magistrate
for
suppression
hearings
in
criminal
cases.
justice
o'connor
often
those
also
require
determinations
of
credibility
of
witnesses,
and
certainly
in
many
cases
can
determine
the
outcome
of
the
trial
itself.
they're
pretty
important
aspects
of
the
procedure,
and
yet
we
upheld
the
use
of
magistrates
there.
justice
o'connor
unless
you
say
that
it's
an
additional
duty,
within
the
additional
duty
language.
justice
o'connor
well,
certainly
there
is
evidence
that
congress
meant
to
give
district
judges
considerable
flexibility
in
the
additional
duties
they
could
assign.
justice
o'connor
i
take
it
you
don't
see
any
problem
with
assigning
the
voir
dire
to
another
judge,
another
article
iii
judge,
for
convenience
of
the
judge's
schedule,
or
something
of
that
sort?
justice
o'connor
mr.
kellogg,
do
you
think
that
if
your
position
were
correct
that
this
was
an
additional
duty
which
could
be
assigned,
that
de
novo
review
is
necessary
to
sustain
it?
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
take
the
position
that
it
can
be
assigned
without
de
novo
review
to
a
magistrate
in
a
felony
case?
justice
o'connor
well,
it's...
it's
a
little
odd
that
congress
would
have
assigned
certain
pretrial
matters
that
can
be
heard
but
subject
to
de
novo
review
and
yet
something
in
the
nature
of
voir
dire
in
a
felony
case,
that
they
would
have
said
nothing
about
it.
justice
o'connor
well,
it
depends.
you
do
have
batson
problems
and
you
do
have,
in
some
courts
at
least,
the
court
asking
the
questions
rather
than
the
parties,
or
counsel.
justice
o'connor
mr.
kellogg,
you...
you...
you
noted
that
a
substantial
number
of
district
courts
have
local
rules
allowing
the
use
of
magistrates
for
conducting
voir
dire.
justice
o'connor
do
those
rules
generally
provide
that
the
consent
of
the
parties
is
necessary
for
voir
dire
in
felony
cases?
justice
o'connor
do
you
know
what
the
practice
is?
in
practice,
do
they
require
consent
of
the
parties
for
the
most
part,
in
felony
cases?
