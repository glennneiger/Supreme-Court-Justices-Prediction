justice
scalia
the
only
thing
that
sort
of
rings
false
is...
is,
if
that's
all
their
talking
about
it
seems
rather
pretentious
to
say
such
insignificant
duties
as
are
not
inconsistent
with
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states.
i
mean,
why
would
they
feel
it
necessary
to
hang
that...
to
hang
that
phrase
on
there
if
they
were
only
talking
about
little,
administrative
things
like
that?
justice
scalia
let
me
repeat
my
question,
because
you're
not
answering
it.
you
told
me
that
this
phrase
only
applies
to
insignificant,
trivial
administrative
things
like
keeping
records
and
so
forth,
right?
justice
scalia
but
if
that's
the
case,
why
couldn't
they
have
just
said,
such
additional
administrative
duties,
instead
of
saying,
such
additional
administrative
duties
as
are
not
inconsistent
with
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states?
who
had
any
doubt
that
the
kind
of
duties
you're
referring
to
would
not
be
inconsistent
with
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states?
when
they
use
that
language
i
think
they
must
have
in
mind
some
duties
of
some
significance,
perhaps.
so
they
have
to
say,
now
don't
go
too
far...
don't
violate
the
constitution
and
laws.
justice
scalia
mr.
rudin,
i
suppose
that
in
order
to
accept
your
position
that
this
is
not
a
pretrial
matter
for
purposes
of
(b)(1)(a),
i
don't
have
to
accept
your
position
that
it's
not
a
pretrial
matter
for
any
purposes,
including
rule
25,
for
example?
justice
scalia
well
your...
your...
your
argument
has
said
this
is
just
clearly...
this
is
clearly
part
of
the
trial.
i'm
not
sure
i
would
agree
with
you
that
it's
part
of
the
trial
for...
for
purposes...
many
other
purposes.
justice
scalia
but
we're
only
talking
here
about
(b)(1)(a),
whether
it
is
a
pretrial
matter
within
the
meaning
of
that
particular
statute,
right?
and...
it
could
be...
it
could
be
not
a
pretrial
matter
within
the
meaning
of
that,
but
be
a
pretrial
matter
for
other
purposes,
couldn't
it?
justice
scalia
well,
what
i
was
thinking
of
when
i
was
when
i
was
making
that
comment
earlier
is
that
this
(b)(1)(a),
which
is
what
you're
now
referring
to,
says
a
judge
may
designate
a
magistrate...
it
just
doesn't
say
pretrial
matter.
it
says
a
magistrate
to
hear
and
determine
any
pretrial
matter.
does
anybody
hear
and
determine
the
seating
of
a
jury?
it's
a
very
strange
terminology
to
apply
to
that,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
well,
you
hear
arguments
on
both
sides
and
you
make
your
determination.
that
that's
what
i
think
that
phrase
normally
brings
to
mind.
it
just
seems
to
me
strange
to
talk
about
hearing
and
determining
the
seating
of
jurors.
justice
scalia
mr.
kellogg,
it
seems
to
me
in
the
clause
you're
addressing
now
what
we're
really
discussing
is
the
meaning
of
the
word
additional,
and
you've
already
acknowledged...
it
can
have
two
possible
meanings,
i
suppose.
it
could
mean,
number
one,
in
addition
to
the
other
things
that
are
herein
specifically
conferred
upon
magistrates.
it
could
mean
that...
what
else
could
it
mean...
and
you
reject
that
because
you
say,
it
doesn't
mean
that
because
you
can't
use
magistrates
in
felony
trials.
although
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
is
not
specifically
conferred
upon
them
here.
justice
scalia
well,
felony
trials
aren't
specifically
covered
in
(b)(1),
so
you
don't
mean
that.
you
don't
mean
any
additional
duty
that
is
not
conferred
in
(b)(1).
you
plainly
don't
mean
that.
so
what's
the
alternative?
justice
scalia
why
doesn't
additional
naturally
mean...
isn't
there
a
second,
quite
reasonable
natural
meaning
of
additional?
that
is,
additional
to
the
areas
covered
in
the
statute
here,
and
the
areas
covered
in
the
statute
very
clearly
are...
are
pretrial
proceedings
that
are
covered
by
(b)
and
trial
proceedings
covered...
covered
by
(c).
any...
anything
that
is
specifically
part
of
pretrial
or
trial
is
covered
and
anything
else
is
additional.
justice
scalia
it
comes
out
the
wrong
way
though,
for
you.
justice
scalia
i
think
it
is.
justice
scalia
no,
i'm
saying
it's...
it's
either
trial
or
pretrial.
wouldn't
you
concede
its
either
one
or
the
other,
or
not?
do
you
think
it's--
justice
scalia
well,
how
else
would
he
do
it?
justice
scalia
but
doesn't
this
go
to
the
very
jurisdiction
of
the
tribunal?
i
mean,
you
certainly
wouldn't
argue
harmless
error
if
the...
if
the
defendant
had
been
tried
by
some
pick-up
group
that
had
no
connection
with
the
government,
you
know...
somebody
decides
let's
convene
a
court
and
try
somebody,
and
they
try
the
individual
and
afterwards
you
find
it's
a
perfectly
fair
trial.
you
wouldn't
come
in
and
say,
well,
what
harm's
been
done?
justice
scalia
it's
not
a
trial,
and
if
you
don't
have
an
article
iii
judge
to
judge,
it's
not
a
court.
