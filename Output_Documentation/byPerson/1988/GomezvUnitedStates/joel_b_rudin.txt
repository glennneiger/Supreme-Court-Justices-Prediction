mr.
joel
b.
rudin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
a
petition
of
certiorari
to
review
a
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
at
issue
is
whether
the
federal
magistrates
act
authorizes
a
magistrate
to
conduct
jury
selection
in
a
felony
trial
over
the
defendant's
objection
and
if
so,
whether
that
procedure
is
unconstitutional.
the
government
concedes
that
the
magistrate's
act
provides
no
felony
trial
jurisdiction
for
magistrates,
but
to
save
this
conviction,
it
argues
that
despite
this
court's
cases,
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
the
speedy
trial
act
and
common
usage
referring
to
jury
selection
as
a
part
of
trial,
that
congress
nevertheless
understood
jury
selection
to
be
a
pretrial
duty
and
intended
it
to
be
authorized
by
the
pretrial
duty
section
of
the
act.
we
think
congress
had
no
such
intention,
that
congress
understood
that
jury
selection
was
part
of
trial
and
that
when
it
precluded
magistrates
from
exercising
felony
trial
jurisdiction,
it
understood
that
preclusion
to
encompass
the
jury
selection
phase
of
trial.
the
magistrate
act
recognizes
the
right
of
litigants
to
trial
before
a
district
court
judge.
it
makes
an
exception
to
that
right
only
where
the
litigants
explicitly
consent,
and
then
only
in
misdemeanor,
petty
offense
or
civil
cases.
congress
nowhere
in
the
statutory
language
or
in
the
legislative
history
gives
any
indication
of
any
intent
to
make
an
exception
for
the
jury
selection
phase
of
a
felony
trial.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
civil
trial
section
of
the
magistrates
act,
congress
provides
for
litigants
to
consent
to
any
or
all
proceedings
in
a
civil
case
to
be
conducted
by
a
magistrate,
suggesting
that
congress
considered
the
possibility
that
a
magistrate
might
conduct
a
part
of
the
civil
trial,
yet
there
is
absolutely
no
language
indicating
that
congress
had
any
understanding
that
a
magistrate
might
conduct
any
part
of
a
felony
trial.
particularly
where
congress
was
so
careful
to
require
consent
for
misdemeanor,
petty
offenses
and
for
civil
trials,
it
doesn't
make
sense
that
congress
would
have
permitted
magistrates
to
conduct
the
critically
important
jury
selection
phase
of
trial,
which
this
court
has
repeatedly
referred
to
as
integral
to
trial,
without
the
party's
consent...
the
defendant's
consent.
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
yes,
your
honor.
of
course,
that
procedure
was
explicitly
authorized
by
the
statute.
this
procedure
is
not
authorized
by
the
statute
and
there
is
the
threshold--
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
--yes,
your
honor,
and
we
say
that
it's
not
an
additional
duty
for
a
number
of
reasons.
one
of
the
most
important
reasons
is
the
reasoning
that
i
just
alluded
to,
which
is
that
despite
the
language
used
in
the
additional
duties
clause,
congress...
congress
and
the
government
concedes
that
the
trial
provisions
of
the
act
preclude
any
felony
trial
jurisdiction
and
there's
no
indication
that
congress
intended
an
exception
for
jury
selection.
i
think
that
the...
the
importance...
importance
of
the
government's
concession
is
even
more
than
that,
because
in
effect
what
the
government
concedes
is
that
you
have
to
look
to
the
balance
of
the
act
and
to
look
to
the
duties
that
congress
explicitly
authorized
or
chose
not
to
authorize,
and
it
would
defeat
the
purpose
of
this
comprehensive
statute,
which
congress
amended
in
1976
precisely
for
the
purpose
of
clarifying
and
defining
the
duties
that
magistrates
might
exercise
and
the
standards
of
procedures
for
review.
it
would
defeat
that
comprehensive
purpose
to
allow
the
additional
duties
clause
to
override
the
balance
of
the
statute.
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
your...
your
honor,
they
use
the
language
that
we
intend
to
permit
district
judges
to
innovate
or
to
experiment,
but
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
innovation
and
the
experimentation
that
they
had
in
mind
was
the
assignment
of
constitutionally
important
adjudicative
functions
that
elsewhere
in
the
statute
it
declined
to
authorize
magistrates
to
perform.
the
legislative
history
makes
that
even
clearer.
the
legislative...
the
house
and
senate...
the
authoritative
house
and
senate
reports
indicate,
after
using
the
language
that
we
intend
to
encourage
experimentation
or
innovation,
that
it
had
in
mind
administrative-type
functions
in
aid
of
the
business
of
the
courts,
precisely
for
the
purpose
of
freeing
up
district
judge...
judges
for
their
vital
and
traditional
adjudicatory
duties,
which
congress
repeatedly
recognized
involved
most
significantly
a
felony
trial.
in
addition--
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
--you...
you...
mr.
chief
justice,
you
mean
the
jury
selection
phase?
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
well,
i
believe
that
this
court
in
in
numerous
cases
has
referred
to
the
criminal
trial
as...
well,
first
of
all
the
criminal
cases
involving
the
most
important
article
iii
values
and
also
to
trials
as
involving
the
most
fundamental
article
iii
values.
in...
in
the
federalist
papers
hamilton
pointed
out
that...
that
the
framers
had
provided
in
article
iii
for
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
but
had
not
provided
for
the
right
to
trial
by...
in
criminal
cases...
but
had
not
provided
for
the
that
in
civil
cases,
because
what's
involved
in
a
criminal
case
is
the
fundamental
interest
in
liberty
and,
of
course,
also
the--
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
--well,
it
may
not
necessarily
be
the
most
intellectually
demanding
role.
i
would
think
that
being
a
justice
on
the
supreme
court
is
probably
the
most
intellectually
demanding
role--
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
--but
not
necessarily
the
most
important
role
under
article
<iii>
[=
iii].
the
framers,
i
think,
understood...
and
this
has
been
repeatedly
referred
to
in
this
court's
decisions...
in
northern
pipeline,
in...
in
other
cases
involving
article
iii,
the
court
has
appeared
to
assume
that
criminal
trials
are
different,
and
the
reason
that
they're
different
is
because
the...
the
liberty
interest
of
the
litigant
is
at
stake.
in
addition,
there's
the
greatest
danger
of
outsider
majoritarian
pressure
and
for
these
reasons,
if...
if
there
is
an
absolute
right
under
article
iii
to
have
the
personal
presence
of
a
fully
independent
district
court
judge,
it
would
appear
to
me
that
it
would
have
to
be
the
criminal
trial...
or
at
least
the
felony
trial,
where
the
most
is
at
stake
and
where
the
values
underlying
article
<iii>
[=
iii]
of
independent,
impartial
adjudication
are
potentially
most
at
risk.
congress
must
have
understood
that
jury
selection
was
part
of
trial
when
it
wrote
the
statute
in
1968
and
when
it
revised
it
in
1976.
in
swain
v.
alabama,
this
court
noted
the
long
and
widely-held
belief
that
jury
selection
was,
as
the
court
held
in
lewis
against
united
states
in
1892
that
v.
alabama,
which
was
decided
only
three
years
before
this
statute
was
written
in
1968,
the
court
repeatedly
referred
to
lewis
against
united
states
and
repeatedly
held
that
the
defendant
had
a
right
to
be
present
during
jury
selection,
because
jury
selection
was
part
of
trial.
the
speedy
trial
act
was
implemented
in
1975,
just
a
year
before
the
revisions
to
the
magistrates
act,
and
in
the
speedy
trial
act,
congress
used
the
concept
of
trial
and
that...
that
has
been
repeatedly
interpreted
by
the
courts...
although
not
yet
by
this
court...
to
include
jury
selection
within
the
concept
of
trial.
and
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
rule
24,
dealing
with
jury
selection,
is...
is
under
the
section,
trial,
and
rule
43a
refers
to
jury
selection
as
being
part
of
trial.
so
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
when
congress
wrote
and
revised
this
statute
that
congress
assumed,
according
to
common
usage
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
that
jury
selection
was
part
of
trial.
there's
simply
no
reason
to
believe
that
congress
intended...
an
unorthodox
understanding
or
view
of
jury
selection,
particularly
that
either
it
was
not
part
of
trial
or
that
it
was
preliminary
to
trial.
and
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
congress
intended
any
exception,
if
it
viewed
it
as
part
of
trial,
given
the
total
absence
of
any
such
reference
in
the
statutory
language
or
in
the
legislative
history.
this
is
a
comprehensive
statute.
congress
repeatedly
indicated
in
1976
that
it
intended
to,
in
light
of
this
court's
restrictive
ruling
in
wingo
v.
wedding
and
the
restrictive
decisions
of
lower
court
cases
interpreting
the
original
magistrates
act,
that
it...
it
intended
to
clarify
and
to
specifically
define
the
duties
of
magistrates.
most
importantly,
where
constitutionally
significant
functions
were
involved,
to...
congress
required
a
very
careful
and
thorough
review
structure
and
the
more
significant
the
function,
the
more
careful
the
review
structure.
and
wherever
a
function
was
involved
that
congress
considered
to
be
particularly
important,
it
required
de
novo
review.
nevertheless,
the
government
argues
here
for
the
first
time
that
jury
selection
is
a
pretrial
duty
that
falls
under
the
pretrial
duty
section
of
the
act.
the
government,
even
though
it
now
contends
that
that
flows
from
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
did
not
make
that
argument
in
the
court
below
and
it
has
not
been
accepted
by
any
other
court
that
has
considered
this
issue,
not
even
by
the
dissenters
in
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
ford
case.
the
government's
position
does
not
make
sense
when
one
analyzes
the
structure
of
this
act.
the
act
divides
pretrial
duties
into
dispositive
and
nondispositive
duties.
and
as
i
mentioned
before
the
dispositive
duties,
which
are
the
more
important,
duties,
all
require
de
novo
review
and
they're
specifically
listed,
yet
jury
selection
is
not
listed
amongst
those
duties.
the
nondispositive
duties
require
the
magistrate
to...
to
finally
determine...
to
actually
enter
a
final
order.
there's
no
statutory
procedure
for
review.
there
is
a
recognition
of
a
standard
of
review,
but
that
standard
is
the
highly
deferential,
clearly
erroneous
or
contrary
to
law
standard,
which
is
plainly
inadequate
under
this
court's
decision
in
raddatz,
but
more
importantly
for
the
purpose
of
interpreting
this
statute,
it's
plainly
inconsistent
with
congress'
understanding
that
for
constitutionally
more
significant
functions
de
novo
review
is
required.
the
legislative
history
supports
this
interpretation,
because
repeatedly
in
the
floor
debate,
in
the
subcommittee
hearings
and
in
the
committee
reports,
congress
referred
to
the
nondispositive
duties
as
the
preliminary
processing
of
cases,
procedural
matters
to
get
cases
ready
for
trial.
and
the
specific
duties
that
it
referred
to
in
the
legislative
reports
were
all
of
this
nature:
ruling
on
continuances,
holding
scheduling
conferences,
ruling
on
matters
of
discovery,
ruling
on
motions
directed
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
pleadings
and
holding
pretrial
conferences.
i
suggest
that
jury
selection,
even
in
congress'
understanding,
could
not
possibly
have
been
considered
comparable
to
these
more
procedural
and
less
constitutionally-significant
functions.
turning
to
the
additional
duties
clause,
justice
o'connor,
the
absence
of
any
provision
for
review
with
respect
to
duties
under
the
additional
duties
clause
i
think
says
a
lot
about
the
limited
scope
of
duties
that
congress
had
in
mind.
as
i
said
before,
wherever
congress
had
in
mind
constitutionally-significant
functions,
congress
provided
for
structure
of
review.
yet
with
additional
duties,
there's
absolutely
no
structure
of
review,
no
standard
of
review
which
suggests
that
what
congress
had
in
mind
for
additional
duties
was
more
limited
ministerial
or
administrative
tasks;
and
those,
in
fact,
are
the
kinds
of
duties
that
congress
listed
in
the
committee
reports.
congress
listed
such
things
as
reviewing
default
judgments,
appointing
cja
counsel,
exonerating
or
forfeiting
ball.
there
was
absolutely
no
statement
of
an...
an
intention
to
enhance
the
jurisdiction
of
magistrates
using
the
vehicle
of
the
additional
duties
clause.
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
well,
justice
scalia,
the...
congress
attempted
in
the
balance
of
the
statute
to
indicate
in
each...
during
each
phase
of
the
process,
whether
the
trial
or
the
pretrial
phase,
what
duties
it
had
in
mind.
yet,
nevertheless
there
are
certain
duties
that
congress
may
have
felt
did
not
clearly
fall
within
any
of
those
categories
and
congress
wanted
to
make
clear
that
district
judges
had
discretion
to
delegate
those
functions
to
the
extent
that
they
were
not
inconsistent
with
the
constitution
or
the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
to
the
extent,
of
course,
that
congress
did
not
mean
to
preclude
them
in
the--
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
--yes,
essentially.
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
well,
i
think
they
had
in
mind
duties
that
were
not
covered
in
the
balance
of
the
act
and
duties
that
were
of
an
administrative
or
ministerial
nature,
otherwise
they
would
not
have
omitted
the
language
that
they
included
in
the
pretrial
section
of
the
act,
notwithstanding
any
laws
to
the
contrary.
because
congress
understood
that
in
wingo
v.
wedding
this
court
had
held
that
where
a
statute
had
used
the
term
court,
or
justice,
or
judge,
that...
for
example,
in
the
context
of
the
habeas
corpus
act,
that
magistrates
did
not
have
authority
to
conduct
evidentiary
hearings
because
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
use
of
the
term,
court.
congress
overrode
that
with
respect
to
pretrial
duties,
they
overrode
it
in
1979
with
respect
to
civil
duties,
but
they
did
not
override
it
with
respect
to
additional
duties.
instead,
they
continued
the
language
that
had
been
in
the
original
statute
which
this
court
had
narrowly
construed
and
they
indicated
that...
that
in
1976,
as
opposed
to
1968
where
the
statute
was
far
more
general,
they
intended
to
more
specifically
define
and
to
clarify
what
duties
they
had
in
mind.
it
seems
to
me
that
a
fair
reading
of
the
additional
duties
clause
is
that
congress
intended
district
courts
to
be
free
to
experiment
with
assigning
other
duties
that
because
the
balance
of
the
act
had
precluded
trial
duties
and
had
precluded
pretrial
duties,
that
all
that
was
left
was
administrative
or
ministerial
type
functions.
the
only
way
to
conclude
that
congress
had
in
mind
something
as
significant
as
jury
selection
would
be
if...
if
congress
had
failed
to
consider
something
as
significant
as
jury
selection
and
it's
clear
that
the
congress
did
consider
the...
the
function
of
trial
and
it
intended
the
statute
to
be
preclusive,
as
the
government
concedes
with
respect
to
felonies.
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
well,
i
think
that
the
analysis
of
of...
that
question
is
different
than
the
constitutional
and
in
the
statutory
context.
in
the
constitutional
context,
though,
i
would
think
that
after
this
court's
decision
in
shore
that
the
parties
probably
could
consent
to
have
the
matter--
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
--i
think
that
the...
in
shore,
this
court
stressed
that
under
article
iii,
that...
the...
from
the
litigant's
individual
point
of
view
certain
rights,
such
as
the
right
to
the
presence
of
the
district
judge
under
article
iii
or
the
right
to
a
jury
trial,
are
required,
but
that
because
those
rights
are
essentially
for
the
benefit
of
the
individual
litigant,
they
may
be
waived.
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
well,
there
were,
your
honor,
although
they
were
not
objections
made
to
the
district
court
based
upon
those
events.
there
was
an
objection
by
defense
counsel
to...
or,
a
question
that
the
government
asked
for
as
to
whether
or
not
any
jurors
understood
spanish,
and
the
reason
that
the
government
gave
was
concern
that
the
jurors
might
interpret
for
themselves
tape-recorded
conversations.
whereas
the
defense
objected
to
that,
i
assume
that
what
the
defense
had
in
mind
was
the
fear
of
a
batson-type
situation
that
the
prosecution
might
excuse
hispanic
jurors.
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
no,
it
wasn't.
there
are
all
sorts
of
functions
that
occur
during
jury
selection
that
are
fundamentally
important
for
the
trial
that
do
not
necessarily
involve
discrete
decisions,
that
theoretically
could
be
reviewed
by
the
district
court
but,
i
would
submit,
in
practice
could
not.
for
example,
it
is
during
the
jury
selection
that
the
trial
judge
has
the
first
opportunity
to
gain
the
respect
of
the
jurors
and
to
gain
control
of
the
trial
proceedings
and
this
is
important,
not
only
because
the
respect
of
the
jurors
and
the
control
of
the
trial
proceedings
may
be
important
during
the
balance
of
the
trial,
when
the
trial
judge
asks
the
jurors
to
follow
his
rulings
and
his
legal
instructions,
but
it's
also
important
because
the
jurors
must
give
candid
responses
and
complete
responses
during
jury
selection,
and
if
they
feel
that
the
process
has
been
demeaned
by
its
assignment
by
the
trial
judge
to
a
lesser
judicial
officer,
then
they
may
not
take
it
as
seriously.
they
may
not
give
as
candid
a
response.
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
your
honor,
i
would
see
a
problem
in
that
and
the
problem
is
the
constitutional
interest
that
underlies
rule
25a.
under
rule
25a,
one
judge
may
not
substitute
for
the
original
judge
at
a
trial
unless
the
original
judge
dies
or
becomes
disabled
and
then
only
where
the
substitute
judge
certifies
his
familiarity
with
the
record.
if
jury
selection
is
part
of
trial,
as
we
suggest
and
as
we
believe
congress
understood,
then
that
rule
would
apply
to
jury
selection
as
well
as
to
the
balance
of
the
trial.
so
that
i
think
that
there...
i
think
that
there
is
a
constitutional
interest
that
the
defendant
has
in
having
the
same
judge
present
throughout
the
trial
and
while
rule
25a
tries
to
accommodate
that
interest
and
to
make
certain
very
rare
exceptions
because
of
concern
with
lengthy
criminal
trials
and
the
waste
of
time
if
they
have
to
be
repeated,
in
this
case
the
trial
judge
assigned
jury
selection
to
a
magistrate
for
no
dire...
there
was
no
dire
emergency
or
reason
why
he
had
to
do
it.
he
did
it
merely
for
his
own
convenience.
and
certainly
when
he...
when
he
replaced
the
magistrate
he
did
not
certify
his
familiarity
with
the
record.
he
didn't
order
or
read
a
transcript.
he
simply
asked
defense
counsel
whether
there
had
been
any
challenges
for
cause
that
had
not
been
granted
and
immediately
after
defense
counsel
responded
that
there
had
been
none,
he
called
in
the
jury
panel
and
swore
them.
he...
he
never
indicated
that
the
defendants
had
any
right
to
challenge
more
than
the
rulings
of
the
magistrate
on
peremptory...
on
challenges
for
cause
and
he
never
indicated
that
he--
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
--well,
there...
there...
i
believe
that
there
are
a
whole
host
of
matters
that
could
be
challenged
and
there
are--
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
--there's
another
group
of
matters
that,
or...
potential
prejudice
that
could
not
be
challenged.
for
example,
a
ruling
on
a
batson
claim.
if...
if
the
defendant
claimed
that
the
prosecutor
was
exercising
peremptory
challenges
in
a
discriminatory
fashion,
i
don't
see...
that
could
be...
and
the
magistrate
denied
that
application,
i
don't
see
how
that
could
be
reviewed
by
a
district
court
judge.
if
anything
the
prosecutor
would
be
unhappy
with
that
situation,
because
presumably
in
exercising
peremptory
challenges
the
prosecutor
would
rely
upon
not
only
the
face
value
of
the
answers
of
the
jurors
but
also
upon
demeanor
and
yet
there's
no
way
that
a
district
court
judge
could
evaluate
the
demeanor
of
individual
jurors
who
the
prosecutor
challenged.
so
i
think
the
prosecutor
might
be
very
unhappy
with
that
situation.
but
certainly
defense
counsel
would
be,
where
his
batson
challenge
has
been
denied,
because
there's
no
way
to
recreate,
as
this
court
in
many
cases
has
noted--
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
--questions
that
the
magistrate
asked
or
did
not
ask.
answers
that
one
juror
gave
that
potentially
prejudiced
the
balance
of
the
jurors.
question...
comment
to
question
of
counsel
that
potentially
may
have
unfairly
prejudiced
the
balance
of
the
jurors,
and
then
all
sorts
of
functions
that
do
not
involve
discrete
decision
making.
during
the
preliminary
legal
instructions,
it's
critically
important
from
the
defendant's
point
of
view
that
the
jury
understands
and
is
willing
to
follow
the
instructions
as
to
presumption
of
innocence
or
reasonable
doubt.
these
are
all
concepts
that
lay
people
frequently
find
difficult
to
understand
and
it's
very
important
for
the
defendant
that
the
jurors
not
only
accept
those
instructions,
but
give
candid
responses
concerning
their
willingness
to
follow
them.
there's
no
way
for
the
magistrate
or
defense
counsel,
or
the
prosecutor
or
defense
counsel
in
exercising
their
peremptory
challenges,
and
there's
certainly
no
way
for
a
district
judge
who's
not
present
to
evaluate
whether
or
not
the
jurors
have
been
candid.
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
no,
the
problem
is
that...
that
where
the
magistrate
is
handed
the
function
of
jury
selection,
the
only
function
that
the
district
judge
is
handing
to
him
as
far
as
the
jury
is
concerned,
and
the
magistrate
is
the
one
who's
giving
the
legal
instructions
and
the
magistrate
is
the
one
who
is
asking
the
questions
of
the
jurors.
if
the
jurors
are
not
candid,
there's
no
way
for
anyone
to
know
that
and
that's
one
of
the
reasons
why
it's
important
that
an
article
iii
judge
conduct
this
process
and
one
of
the
reasons
why
harmless
error
analysis
cannot
apply.
it...
it's
for
the
same
reason
in
waller
v.
georgia
involving
the
right
to
a
public
trial
in
the
context
of
a
suppression
hearing.
this
court
noted,
if
i
may
quote,
"while
the
benefits
of
a
public
trial
are
frequently
intangible,
difficult
to
prove
or
a
matter
of
chance,
the
framers
plainly
thought
them
nonetheless
real.
"
the
framers
thought
that
having
an
independent,
impartial
judge
present,
particularly
in
a
criminal
proceeding
involving
the
most
fundamental
interest
and
the
greatest
danger
of
majoritarian
or
outside
pressure,
that
it
was
important
to
have...
for
a
litigant
to
have
the
benefit
of
that
independent
judgment.
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
don't
understand
your
question.
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the--
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
--this
court
could
decide
that
it's
a
pretrial
matter
for
constitutional
purposes,
but
that
would
not
answer
the
question
of
what
congress
had
in
mind,
and
given
that
the
prevailing
view
in...
in
this
court's
decisions
and
the...
certainly
the
common
usage
that
trial
is...
that
jury
selection
was
part
of
trial.
i
think
it's
significant
that
there's
absolutely
no
discussion
of
it
in
the
legislative
history.
it...
it's
inconceivable
to
me
that
congress
would
have
intended
the
function
of
jury
selection
not
to
be
viewed
as
part
of
trial
without
any
such
discussion,
and
the
most
logical
explanation
for
why
there
was
no
discussion
is
because
congress
assumed,
like
this
court,
like
the
federal
rules,
that
it
was
part
of
trial
and
therefore
it's
not...
that
function
is
precluded
under
the
trial
provisions
of
the
act.
finally,
i
would
just
like
to
note
concerning
the
question
of
harmless
error,
that
in
wingo
v.
wedding,
involving
the
construction
of
the
magistrate's
act
in
connection
with
the
habeas
corpus
act,
after
holding
that
the
magistrate...
that
assigning
the
function
of
holding
an
evidentiary
hearing
was
inconsistent
with
the
habeas
corpus
act,
this
court
reversed
without
conducting
any
harmless
error
analysis,
presumably
because
the
court
reasoned
that
congress
had
not
empowered
magistrates
to
conduct
habeas
corpus
hearings,
and
for
the
same
reason
we
believe
there
should
be
a
reversal
in
this
case.
congress
did
not
empower
magistrates
to
conduct
jury
selection
in
a
felony
trial,
which
is
the
other
point
i
wanted
to
make
in
response
to
justice
kennedy.
the
statutory
issue
is
different
than
the
constitutional
issue
in
this
case.
federal
courts
are
courts
of
limited
jurisdiction.
congress
has
given
the...
the
authority
to
hold
criminal
trial
proceedings
to
the
district
court.
it
has
authorized
the
district
court
to
assign
that
function
to
magistrates
in
certain
areas.
it
has
not
authorized
district
judges
to
assign
that
function
to
magistrates
in
the
area
of
the
felony
trial.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
additional
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
joel
b.
rudin
thank
you,
your
honor.
in
the
raddatz
case,
the
government
strenuously
argued
to
this
court
and
a
majority
of
this
court
accepted
that
the
interests
at
stake
in
a
suppression
hearing
are
far
less
significant.
in
footnote
number
11
of
my
reply
brief
i
quote
the
government
stating
in
raddatz
that
the
pretrial
suppression
hearing
involves
deterrence
of
official
misconduct
and...
and
the
exclusion
of
inherently
reliable
evidence
as
opposed
to
the
accused's
paramount
interest
in
his
liberty
at
trial.
the
government
argued
in
raddatz,
indeed,
the
defendant's
stake
in
the
outcome
of
a
suppression
hearing
is
significantly
less
than
the
individual
interest
implicated
by
various
civil
proceedings.
now
the
government
comes
before
this
court
and
argues
that
somehow
the
defendant's
interest
in
a
suppression
hearing
is
more
important
than
his
interest
in
jury
selection,
which
in
case
after
case
after
case,
this
court
has
held
is
vitally
important
to
the
fairness
of
trial.
i
would
suggest
that...
that
the...
i
would
also
say
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
stated,
for
example
in
wainwright
v.
witt
that
de
novo
review
is
impossible
in
the
jury
selection
context
because
of
the
importance
of
the
fact-finder
being
present
and
observing
the
demeanor
of
jurors.
where
a
juror
is
erroneously
excluded
by
a
magistrate,
that
juror
is
gone.
he
can't
be
requestioned.
where
defense
counsel
exercises
a
peremptory
challenge
because
the
magistrate
has
erroneously
denied
his
challenge
for
cause,
that
juror
has
gone
as
well.
