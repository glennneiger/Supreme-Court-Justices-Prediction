mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
is
once
again
called
upon
to
determine
the
circumstances
under
which
an
individual
who
was
seized
will
be
deemed
seized
under
the
fourth
amendment.
it
is
the
petitioners'
position
in
this
case
that
the
decedent,
william
brower,
was
seized
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment
when
he
was
chased
into
a
concealed
police
roadblock.
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
to
the
contrary
we
believe
is
contrary
in
itself
with
this
court's
prior
precedents
beginning
with
terry
v.
ohio
on
up
through
u.s.
v.
mendenhall,
and
finally
this
past
summer
with
michigan
v.
chesternut.
most
significant
in
the
terry
case
we
feel
is
the
test
set
forth
in
a
footnote,
footnote
number
16.
now,
that
footnote,
although
it
is
only
a
footnote,
has
been
incorporated
into
the
majority
opinions
in
the
mendenhall,
the
ins
v.
delgado,
the
michigan
v.
chesternut
case.
therein
the
court
stated
that
it
was
not
all
conduct
or
all
personal
intercourse
between
a
policeman
and
a
citizen
which
will
constitute
a
seizure.
only
when
the
officer
by
means
of
physical
force
or
a
show
of
authority
has
in
some
way
restrained
the
liberty
of
a
citizen
may
we
conclude
that
there
has
been
a
seizure
within
the
fourth
amendment.
the
test
is
very
easy
and
straightforward
to
apply
in
a
situation
where
the
fleeing
suspect
decides
to
stop,
submit
to
the
authority
and/or
is
physically
and
bodily
restrained.
it
is
not
so
easy
to
apply
in
situations
where
the
suspect
does
not
submit
to
the
authority
or
where
the
suspect,
perhaps
in
a
case
similar
to
this,
is
not
arrested
or
detained
or
restrained
in
the
traditional
sense
of
laying
on
of
hands
or
handcuffing.
in
these
latter
situations,
the
court
has
given
guidance
to
us
and
has
further
refined
the
test
set
forth
in
terry.
the
court
did
this
in
1980
in
the
mendenhall
case.
in
the
mendenhall
case,
the
court
held
that
a
person
was
seized
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment
when,
in
consideration
of
all
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
incident,
a
reasonable
person
would
believe
that
they
are
not
free
to
leave.
although
that
majority
opinion
in
mendenhall
was
only
joined
in
by
two
justices,
it
was
later
adopted
by
the
full
majority
in
the
ins
v.
delgado
case.
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
not
by
a
long
shot,
justice
o'connor.
that
is
only
the
issue
of
seizure.
there
is
still
the
issue
of
reasonableness
that
must
be
overcome.
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
this
past
summer--
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
--of
the
suspect
or
the
hostages?
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
yes,
i
believe
it
would
be,
justice
scalla,
because
the
court
in
the
mendenhall
case
has
said
that
we
look
to
the
conduct
of
the
police
officers.
and
as
the
court
stated
in
michigan
v.
chesternut,
this
is
an
objective
standard
which
allows
us
to
measure
the
conduct
from
one
police
encounter
to
the
next.
would
the
conduct
of
the
police
officers
reasonably
impart
to
the
hostage
taker
that
he
was
not
free
to
leave...
and
certainly
throwing
up
a,
a
number
of
officers
around
the
hostage
scene
would
tell
him
he's
not
free
to
leave.
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
it
is
if
we
follow
mendenhall
to
its
logical
conclusion.
i
suggest--
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
--well,
i,
i
would
suggest,
justice
scalla,
that
in
keeping
with
my
response
to
justice
o'connor,
that
it
is
a
seizure.
what
we
need
to
do
is,
is
further
determine,
before
liability
certainly
can
attach,
as
to
whether
it
was
reasonable.
again,
following
mendenhall
to
a
reasonable
and
logical
conclusion
tells
us
that
if
the
conduct
of
the
police
reasonably...
reasonably...
communicates
to
the
suspect
that
he
is
not
free
with...
free
to
leave,
meaning
in
a
broader
sense
that
he
has
a,
a
freedom
of
liberty.
this
is
much
more
than
just
a
freedom
against
bodily
restraint.
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
justice
stevens,
i
believe
the
seizure
took
place
at
the
very
instant
that
the
pursuit
began
long
before
we
ever
got
20
miles
down
the
road--
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
--i
cannot
say
in
all
honesty
if
it
was
reasonable
or
unreasonable
simply
because
we
are
the
very--
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
--absolutely
not
in
a
general
sense.
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
if
that
was
the
circumstances
within
which
this
case--
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
--i
have
nothing
to
indicate
to
the
court
that
it
was
unreasonable
at
that
moment,
again
concentrating--
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
--well,
justice
o'connor--
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
--i
think
that
there
is,
and
i
believe
that
there
is
because,
as
the
court
has
indicated
in
the
chesternut
case,
we
must
consider
all
of
the
circumstances.
and
on
the
issue
of
reasonableness,
tennessee
v.
garner
tells
us
that
we
must
weigh
and
consider
the
nature
of
the
intrusion,
and--
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
--it
may
well,
but
i
believe
that
we
have
to
consider
again
the
purpose
for
which
the
pursuit
is
taking
place.
and
it
may
well
be,
as
the
district
court
indicated
in
tennessee
v.
garner,
if
a
suspect
chooses
to
flee,
he
may
well,
in
some
instances,
assume
the
risk,
but
i
believe
that
we
have
to
look
to
the
conduct
for
the--
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
--generally
speaking,
yes,
justice
o'connor,
that
person
does.
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
not
necessarily.
again,
it
depends
on
the
circumstances
of
each
case.
and
if,
if
i
may,
this
particular
case
was
dismissed
at
the
complaint
stage.
we
have
not
had
an
opportunity
to
flush
out
the
facts
of
this
case.
i
can
relate
to
the
court
that
this
took
place...
and
i
believe--
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
--that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
the
specific
issue
of
reasonableness
was
not
addressed
by
the
district
court.
there
was
some,
i
believe,
indirect
inference,
if
you
will,
by
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
i
believe
the
ninth
circuit
dealt
with
it
certainly
not...
perhaps
it
was
not
addressed
with
as
much
energy
or
as--
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
--in
and
of
itself,
no.
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
it
was--
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
that
the
reason
that
it's
important
is
to
fully
develop
and
utilize
the
case
of
mendell...
mendenhalll
and
the
test
that
has
been
given
to
us.
it...
and
there
is
some,
some
concern
that
the
roadblock
was
not,
in
fact,
a,
a
seizure.
the
galas
case
tells
us
this
out
the
sixth
circuit.
but
i
think
by
way
of
emphasizing
that
if
the
mendenhall
case
shows
us
that
a
seizure
occurs
at
the
moment
of
the
pursuit,
then
certainly
we
have
the
same
situation
with
respect
to
the
roadblock.
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
yes,
it
would.
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
the
issue
of
the
seizure
is
most
predominant.
but
i
believe,
if
i
may
in
further
response
to
the
last
question,
why
should
we
consider
a
seizure
from
the
inception
of
the
pursuit?
and
there's
a
very
good,
practical
reason.
if
we
ignore
the
conduct
of
the
police...
and
we
are
told
to
look
at
all
of
the
circumstances.
this
is
what
chesternut
tells
us,
to
look
at
all
of
the
circumstances.
if
we
ignore
the
police
conduct
from
the
inception
of
the
pursuit
up
until
the
time
that
there...
the
young
man
collides
with
the
roadblock,
we
have
removed
from
judicial
scrutiny
all
of
the
conduct
of
the
police
officers
in
that
interim.
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
it
can
be--
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
--well,
it
was
my
understanding
of
chesternut,
mr.
justice,
that
we
are
to
look
at
all
of
the
circumstances,
and
the
complaints
as
well
as
the
decision
of
the
ninth--
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
--it
may
appear--
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
--very
definitely,
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
yes,
i--
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
--well,
i
believe
that
it...
it
is
still
a
seizure.
the...
whatever
was
accomplished
by
the
law
enforcement
has
certainly
indicated
to
that
person
that
he
is
not
free
to
leave.
i
most
definitely
think
there's
a
seizure.
now,
on
the
issue
of
whether
this
requires--
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
--no.
that's
a
little
tougher.
mr.
justice,
i
think
again--
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
--perhaps
intentional,
but
i
do
not
believe
intentional
in
the
sense
that
we
decided
in
the
daniels
and
the
other
cases
of
the
individuals
who
were
prisoners
and
there
was
an
excessive
use
of
force
alleged
against
them.
this
court
i
believe
indicated
that
mere
negligence
was
not
enough.
in
those
cases
we
were
addressing
the
fourteenth.
here
we
are
addressing
the
fourth.
we're
addressing
the
issue
of
not
somebody
in
prison.
we're
addressing
the
freedom
of
an
individual
walking
the
street.
now,
again,
if
the
court
means
did...
did
he
intentionally
run
the
car
into
the
individual
as
opposed
to
simply
accidentally,
i
think
that
there
perhaps
is
quite
a
distinction
to
be
drawn.
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
they
did,
and--
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
--and
on
purpose.
we
have
a...
we
have
a
mechanism
utilized
by
the
police,
and
we
by
no
means
are
indicating
that
there
should
be
a
per
se
unconstitutional
ruling
with
respect
to
all
roadblocks.
but
what
we
have
to
do,
what
the
court
has
indicated
that
we
need
to
do,
is
to
look
at
the
conduct
of
the
police.
they
intentionally
set
that
roadblock
as...
as...
just
as
intentionally
as
the
police
officer
pulled
the
trigger
in
the
tennessee
garner
case.
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
that
is
correct.
we
ask
only
the
opportunity
to
prove
that
it
was
unreasonable.
we
have
so
far
in
four
years
been
denied
that.
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
i
believe
under
mendenhall,
justice
marshall,
it
definitely
is.
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
yes.
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
as
long
as
the
officer
in
his
broken-down
vehicle
in
some
way
manifested
to
that
individual...
to
a
reasonable
individual
that
he
was
not
at
liberty
to
leave.
and
if
i
may
stress
the
point
here,
again
we're
not
talking
about
under
the
fourth
amendment
a
mere...
certainly
it
comes
to
something--
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
--well--
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
--the
test
that
we
must
apply--
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
--no.
i
believe
that
they're
not
two
different
animals.
if
i...
if
i
may
disagree--
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
--but
they're
all
conduct
of
the
police
officers.
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
there
is
a
difference,
but
they
were
all
put
into
force
or
into
play
by
the
police
officers.
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
that
made
it
a
seizure.
once
that's
reasonably
communicated
to
the
decedent,
he
couldn't
leave.
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
absolutely,
and
i
think
i
can
explain
that
if
i
might.
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
let
me
give
it
a
try.
i
think
what's...
what's
most
important
here
is
we
need
to
look
at
the
interest
that's
being
protected
by
the
fourth.
again,
this
is
not
a
mere
right
to
be
free
from
bodily
restraint.
the
case,
terry
v.
ohio,
spoke
not
of
bodily
restraint.
it
spoke
of
being
restrained...
one's
liberty
being
restrained.
and
if
i
may,
there
is...
there
are
a
couple...
there
are
a
couple
of
other
quotes
from
terry
v.
ohio
that
emphasize
that
what
we're
dealing
with
is
something
much
broader
that
simple
bodily
restraint.
the
court
speaks
in
language
of
intrusion
upon
the
sanctity
of
the
individual,
invasion
of
the
person's
personal
security,
freedom
from
all...
and
i'm
quoting
here...
"freedom
from
all
restraints
or
interference
of
others,
freedom
from
unreasonable
government
intrusion.
"
certainly
if
this
court...
and
in
michigan
v.
chesternut,
the
court
there
spoke
about
a
right
to
ignore,
a
right
to
disregard.
they
are
speaking
about
something
much
more
noble,
something
much
broader
than
a
right
to
simply
be
free
from...
from
physical
restraint
and
being
handcuffed,
if
you
will.
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
i
personally
am
still
troubled
with
the
skidding
police
car.
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
the
skidding
police
car...
i...
i
believe
that
i
would
have
to
concede
if
the
officer
simply
negligently
skidded
across
the
road
and
there
was
an
automobile
accident...
and
this
must
happen
thousands
of
times...
that
i
would
have
a
lot
of
difficulty
arguing--
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
--well,
two
things.
one,
they...
they
do
intend
to
restrain
the
individual's
liberty
to
just
simply
go
wherever
he
wishes.
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
to
use
that
road
or
to
go
where
he
wishes--
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
--that's
a--
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
--any
roadblock
is
a
seizure
if
the
police
communicate
reasonably
that
that
individual
is
not
simply
free
to
totally
ignore
it.
if
that
individual
in
this
case
was
free
to
turn
around,
take
a
side
road,
go
right
past
the
officer
that
was
pursuing
him
and
totally,
as
the
court
has
said,
ignore
or
disregard,
then
we
would
not
have
a
seizure.
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
here
again
i
must
fall
back
on
the
mendenhall.
did
that
roadblock
and
did
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
both
the
seizure
as
well
as
the
roadblock,
radio
communications,
whatever
it
was
that
the
police
officers
did,
if
it
reasonably
communicated
to
the
individual--
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
--under
mendenhall,
yes,
probably
reasonable.
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
if
the--
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
--no.
i
think
we're
confusing
reasonableness
with
the
issue
of
seizure
itself.
if
the
roadblock
was
designed,
was
intended,
if
i
may
borrow
on
the
justice's
terminology...
if
it
was
designed
or
intended
to
restrain
an
individual's
liberty,
most
definitely,
but
just
to
block
a
potholes,
no.
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
if
i
understand
the
justice's
question,
i'm
being
asked
if
under
those
circumstances
it
would
be
reasonable
for
the
officer
to--
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
--to
use
deadly
force.
yes,
most
definitely.
and
that
quite
alters
the
circumstances--
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
--again,
if
i
understand--
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
--as
a
matter
of
law,
if
we
have
somebody
who
is
armed?
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
i
believe
that
if...
if
it
is
interpreted
as
a
deadly
weapon,
if
the
utilization
of
the
vehicle
in
the
manner
that
it
was
being
utilized
in
fact
presented
significant
or
presented
risk
of
serious
injury
or
death
to
others,
most
certainly
we
should
not
exclude
that--
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
--with
all
due
respect,
justice
o'connor,
that
is...
that
goes
to
the
issue
that
we
have
been
begging
to
get
before
the
court
and
that
is
the
reasonableness.
we
have
not
even
had
an
opportunity
to
f
lush
out,
to
look
at
more
than
a
police
report
in
the
situation.
if
the
highway
was
straight,
if
there
were
no
other
individuals
on
the
highway
that
night,
if
it
was
late
at
night
as
it
was,
it
would
be
a
different
situation
than
pursuing
him
through
downtown
los
angeles
and
or
downtown
washington,
because
i
think
again
the
scenarios
that
we
can
think
about
are
as
numerous
as
our
imagination
will
allow.
all
we
are
asking
is
for
this
court
to
follow
the
mendenhall
and
chesternut
logic
finding
that
there
is
a
seizure.
there
is
a
whole
other
issue
before
liability
attaches,
and
that's
reasonableness
of
the
conduct.
and
it
may
well
prove
that
what
the
officers
did
that
night
was
reasonable,
but
if
we
don't
get
an
opportunity
to
explore
and
to
look
into
that
conduct,
if
we
say
that
this
is
not
a
seizure,
whatever
those
police
officers
did
that
night
is
going
to
go
without
judicial
scrutiny.
if
the
young
man
in
tennessee
v.
garner--
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
--if
the
court
made
a
ruling
or
if
there
was
a
judicial
finding
that
all
fleeing
suspects
in
all
types
of
vehicles
under
all
circumstances,
be
it
a
dirt
road
or
a
super
highway,
is
utilizing
a
dangerous
weapon,
if
you
will,
that's
the
type
of
finding
that
would
have
to
be
brought
about.
but
i
go
back
to
the
young
man
in
tennessee
who
was
shot.
if
by
circumstances
that
bullet
moved
over
a
couple
of
inches
and
he
survived
and
limped
home
or
wherever
reached
his...
some
solitude
somewhere...
the
officer
in
that
case
told
him
he
was
a
police
officer.
he
told
him
he
was
under
arrest,
and
he
pulled
a
gun
and
he
shot
him.
would
the
conduct
be
any
less
egregious
against
a
nonviolent
individual
just
because
the
individual
fortuitously
got
over
the
fence
and
got
away
and
maybe
was
permanently
injured
as
opposed
to
being
killed?
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
i
believe
that
was
what
the
opinion
said,
yes.
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
that...
that
is
the
question
particularly.
does
the...
does
the
car...
does
it
have
the
same
deadly
force
perhaps
as
a
weapon,
a
knife,
a
gun?
i'd
like
to
reserve
a
few
moments,
if
i
could.
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
address,
if
i
can,
the
last
point
that
was
raised
on
the
chesternut
case
and...
and
the
issue
of
whether
there
has
to
be
a
certain
communication
by
the
law
enforcement
officers
to
the
intended...
or
the
suspect.
i
believe...
and
i
may
be
wrong,
but
i
believe
that
the
court
specifically
indicated
in
that
case
that
communicating
or
communication
of
an
intent
is...
is
important
only
to
the
extent
that
it
may
have
actually
been
communicated,
that
the
court
indicated
that
it
was
not
a
requirement
that
you
somehow
communicate
the
intent.
i
don't...
i'm
not
sure
how
a
case
would
ever
be
proved
if
we
have
to
look
to
the
subjective
intent
of
every
police
officer
making
an
arrest.
i
think
also
on
the
issue
of
the
case
of
chesternut,
it's
important
to
understand
that
the
court
was
asked
in
that
case
to
make
a
determination
that
a
pursuit
alone
was
a...
a
seizure.
the
court
found
that
there
was
no
seizure,
but
what's
important
is
why
the
court
found
no
seizure.
the
court
found
that
there
was
no
seizure
not
because
there
was
a
lack
of
bodily
restraint
or
a
submission
to
authority,
but
the
court,
again
following
the
mendenhall
test,
looked
to
the
conduct
of
the
police
officers
and
very
simply
said
that
these
officers...
what
they
did
could
not
reasonably
communicate
to
anyone
that
the
individual
was
not
free
to
walk
away
or
disregard
the
show
of
authority.
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
one
interpretation
of
freedom
of
movement,
restraint
of
freedom
of
movement,
could
be
taken
that
we
require
bodily
restraint.
that's
only
one.
i
think
in
light
of
the
language
that
was
quoted
earlier
from
the
terry...
and
that's
where
that
came...
the
terry
v.
ohio
case,
that
we're
speaking
of
something
much,
much
broader
than
a
simple
freedom
from
bodily
restraint.
freedom
of
movement
should
be
read
as
a
right
of
movement,
not
a
simple
bodily
restraint.
also
on
the
issue
that
was
raised
of
the
roadblock
and
whether
it
should
be...
there
should
be
a
finding
or
an
allegation
in
the
complaint
of
whether
it
was
intentional
or
not,
here
again
i
think
that
there
must
be
an
distinction
drawn
between
the
intention
in
the
sense
that
the
officers
did
what
they
intended
to
do,
as
in
this
case
pursuing
and
setting
up
a
roadblock,
versus
an
intention
to
kill
this
young
man.
i
don't
know
that
i
could
allege
or
ever
prove
that
these
police
officers
tried
to
kill
this
boy.
i
don't
think
that
would
be
possible,
but
i
do
not
believe
in...
in
utilizing
or
looking
to
the
requirement
of
intent
that
this
court
would
require
such
a
showing
under
the
fourth
amendment.
certainly,
again,
under
the
daniels
case,
et
cetera,
we
know
that
negligence
is
not
enough
with
respect
to
a
fourteenth
amendment.
but
i'm
not
sure
that
this
court,
when
we're
looking
to
the
arbitrary
conduct
of
a
police
officer...
and
that's
what
we're
trying
to
restrict...
that
this
court
would
require
intentional
in
the
sense
that
they
intended
to
kill
the
young
man,
only
that
they
intended
their
conduct,
setting
up
the
roadblock.
there
is
the
question
that
was
raised
as
to
whether
deadly
force
was...
was
an
issue
on
seizure,
and
i
think
the
general
consensus
was,
no,
that's
something
that
should
be
left
for
the
issue
of
reasonableness.
and
not
to
work
against
myself,
but
i
don't
feel
that
that's
necessarily
correct.
the
court
in
the
michigan
v.
tennessee
case
indicated
that
what
we
are
doing
is
measuring
and
gauging
the
coercive
conduct
of
the
police
officer.
and
we're
not
doing
that
to
determine
whether
the
conduct
itself
was
somehow
inherently
offensive
or
heinous.
what
we're
doing
is
looking
to
the
conduct
to
see
if
it
rises
out
of
the
normal
social
conduct
which
terry
tells
us
is
okay,
is
not
a
seizure.
is
it
sufficiently
coercive
in
the
sense
that
it
is
now
elevated
out
of
that
circumstance
and
into
a
seizure?
i
think
it's
important
in
that
sense
that
the
ninth
circuit
did
find
on
the
same
factual
situation
again
that
the
conduct
here
was
intentional,
unjustified,
brutal
and
offensive
to
human
dignity.
certainly
if
that
was
the
case...
if
that's
what
these
facts
tell
us,
then
i
think
that
this
certainly
is
coercive
to
the
extent
that
it
raises
and
arises
beyond
mere
social
conduct
by
the
police
officers.
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
well,
i
think
that
would
be
too
harsh
a
law.
i
think
the
law
in
that
case,
if
that
was
the
rule,
that
if
you
flee
you
are
opening
yourself
to
deadly
force
under
any
circumstances...
if
i...
am
i
misunderstanding
the--
mr.
robert
gene
gilmore
--thank
you.
