justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
getting
back
to
the
beginning,
was
there
pursuit...
to
starting
of
the
pursuit
with
seizure?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
that
apply
if
the
police
had
a
broken
down
ford
and
the
criminal
had
a
bugatti?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
still
would
be
a--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--but
you
insist
on
putting
the
pursuit
in
this
case,
the
starting
of
the
pursuit.
and
i
don't
see
where
that
has
anything
in
the
world
to
do
with
the
case--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--about
the
roadblock.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they're
two
different
animals.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
pursuit
moves
and
the
roadblock
doesn't.
isn't
that
a
difference?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
the
difference?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
made
it
a
seizure.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
the
roadblock
was
on
the
opposite
side
of
town
and
the
pursuit
started
on
this
side,
the
pursuit
would
be
a
procedure.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
doubt
it.
[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
a
seizure
of
everybody
that
comes
down
the
road?
