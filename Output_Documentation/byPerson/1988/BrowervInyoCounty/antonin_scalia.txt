justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
gilmore,
you...
you
said
a
minute
ago
that...
that
the
freedom...
the
individual's
freedom
has
to
have
been
restrained
in
some
way.
it's
more
than
in
some
way,
isn't
it?
suppose...
suppose
the
police
receive
word
that
there
is
someone
who
has
taken
a
hostage
in
a
particular
house
and
they
cordon
off
a
10-block
area.
as
soon
as
they
put
up
those,
those
police
barricades,
is
that
a
seizure?
justice
antonin
scalia
of,
of
the
suspect.
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
certainly
free
to
leave
the
house.
he
can't
get
out
of
the
barricaded
area.
what
if...
what
if
there's
a
fleeing
suspect
and
the...
and
the
police
notifies
all
airports
and
all
bus
terminals
to
keep
a
lookout
for
this
individual
and
instructs
its
officers
to
stop
him
if
he
tries
to
leave
the
state?
is
that
a
seizure?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
seem
like
a
seizure
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
we
talk
about
the
roadblock?
let's
assume
that
i...
i...
that
i
don't
think
a
chase
is
a
seizure,
that
i
think
a
chase
is
at
most
an
attempted
seizure,
and
that
all
you
have
here
is
a...
is...
is
a
roadblock.
you
would
agree,
would
you
not,
that
there's
no
seizure
unless
it's
intentional.
if...
if
a
police
officer
leaves
a...
a
jail
for
the
night
and
locks
the...
locks
the
gate
not
knowing
that
a
visitor
is
still...
is
still
in
the
jail,
would
you
call
that
a
seizure?
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
it
like
a
false
arrest?
isn't
it
an
intentional
kind
of
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
just
a
couple
of
sentences,
though.
it's
not
a
treatise.
you...
you...
you
sort
of
suspect
that
they...
they
at
least
left
out
one
thing.
it
has
to
be
intentional
or
else
you're
going
to
have
to
change
your
answer
about
the
skidding
police
car.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
me
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
assume
i
think
you
need
intent.
what
was
the
intent
with
the
roadblock
here?
when
i
when
the
police
set
up
a
roadblock,
do
they
necessarily
intend
to...
to
restrict?
i
often
see
a
roadblock,
and
i
just
take
a...
take
a
street
before
the
roadblock,
use
another
street.
they
clearly
intend
to
block
further
use
of
that
street,
but
do
they
intend
by
setting
up
a
roadblock
to
stop
dead
any
individual
who
is
using
that
road?
is
that
clear?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
use
that
road.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
a
seizure.
so,
any--
justice
antonin
scalia
--any
roadblock
is
a
seizure?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that's
right.
otherwise
you're
saying
if
you
put
up
an
unreasonable
roadblock...
let's
say
there's
really
nothing
wrong
with
the
street,
and
some
policeman
says,
well,
i
think
there's
something
wrong,
and
it's
unreasonable
to
think
there's
anything
wrong,
so
they
cut
up
a
roadblock.
if
that's
an
unreasonable
roadblock,
do
you
say
there's
been
a...
an
unconstitutional
seizure?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
give
that
away,
mr.
gilmore.
why
try
to
hold
that
territory?
i
mean,
if...
if
we
wouldn't
reach
that
under...
under...
under
the
seizure
provision
of
the
constitution,
i
expect
we'd
find
substantive
due
process
restrictions
against
intentionally
setting
up
roadblocks
to
kill
people
who
have...
who
have
done
nothing
but
stolen
a
car.
you
don't
think
that's
going
to
survive
anyway,
do
you?
i
have
the
wrong
counsel.
mr.
mcdowell.
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
why
do
you
try
to
hold
on
to
the
territory
that...
that
even
if
it
was
intentionally
set
up,
it
couldn't
violate
the...
in
order
to
kill
the
fleeing
felon,
it
couldn't
violate
the
search
and
seizure
provision
of
the
constitution?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it
was
intentionally
set
up--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
order
to
have
him
crash
into
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
your
position
is
if
it
isn't
intentionally
set
up
for
that
purpose,
what?
there's
no...
there's
no
seizure--
justice
antonin
scalia
--there's
no
seizure
because
he
hasn't
stopped.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mcdowell,
i...
i
thought
your
position
was
that
it
isn't
enough
that
it
be
unreasonable,
that
even
if
it
is
unreasonable,
that's
not
enough.
it
has
to
be
intentional.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
a
difference
between
setting
up
a
roadblock
unreasonably,
negligently
putting
a
car,
a
police
car,
in
front
of
it
with...
with
high
beams
on
so
the
person
doesn't
seeing
it
and
intentionally
doing
that
in
order
that
the
fleeing
felon
will
crash
into
the
roadblock.
that
is
intentionally
seizing
him
by
means
of
the
roadblock,--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
thought
that
was
your
position.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
could
still
be
unreasonable
and
not
in
your
view
be,
a...
an
unlawful
seizure.
justice
antonin
scalia
--you've
got
me
puzzled,
now.
you're
saying
it
can
both
be
a
seizure
and
be
unreasonable
and
not
violate
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
gilmore,
why
shouldn't
we
adopt
a
constitutional
rule
that
encourages
people
to
abide
by
police
directives?
if
those
directives
turn
out
to
be
unreasonable,
then
they
have
a
constitutional
cause
of
action
against
the
police
officers.
but
why
should
we
adopt
a
rule
that
says
go
ahead,
run,
flee
down
the
highway?
and
even
if
you
do
that
and
endanger
public
lives,
you
will
still
have
a
constitutional
cause
of
action
against
the
police
officers
if
it
turns
out
that
their
chase
is
unreasonable.
in
other
words,
why
shouldn't
we
adopt
the
rule
that
you
have
to
stop?
and
if...
if
they've
been
wrong
in
stopping
you,
then
you
have
a
cause
of
action,
but
if
you
don't
listen
to
them
and
endanger
the
public,
you
don't
have
a
constitutional
cause
of
action?
why
doesn't
that
make
sense?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
saying
they
can
kill
you.
i
mean,
that's
a
different...
i
think
we're
all
agreed
that
if
they
intentionally
sought
to...
to
kill
this
person,
it
would
be
no
different.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit.
william
james
caldwell,
who
is
brower
was
killed
when
a
stolen
car
that
he
had
been
driving
at
high
speeds
at
an
effort
to
elude
the
police,
crashed
into
a
police
roadblock.
his
heirs,
the
petitioners
here
brought
suit
in
federal
district
court,
claiming
that
the
roadblock
amounted
to
excessive
force
and
that
respondents
had
therefore
made
an
unreasonable
seizure
of
brower.
the
allegations
were
that
the
roadblock
had
intentionally
been
set
up
just
around
the
bend
in
the
road
at
night
with
a
police
cruiser
stationed
with
its
high-beam
headlights
shinning
in
the
eyes
of
the
on-coming
car,
so
that
the
crash
would
be
inevitable.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
suit
for
failure
to
state
a
fourth
amendment
claim
on
the
ground
that
the
roadblock
was
reasonable
under
the
circumstances.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
but
on
a
different
theory
concluding
simply
that
no
seizure
had
taken
place.
because
the
police
roadblock
terminated
brower's
movement
through
means
intentionally
applied,
we
conclude
that
a
fourth
amendment
seizure
did
take
place.
we
accordingly
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
for
consideration
of
whether
the
district
court
erred
in
concluding
that
the
roadblock
was
not
unreasonable.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justices
brennan,
marshall,
and
blackmun
joined.
