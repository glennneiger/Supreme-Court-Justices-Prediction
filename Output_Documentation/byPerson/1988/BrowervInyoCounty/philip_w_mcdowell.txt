mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the,
the
overriding
issue
today
is
whether...
not
whether
this
case
will
receive
judicial
scrutiny.
the
case
will
receive
scrutiny...
can
receive
scrutiny
in
the
state
court.
the
question
is
whether
it
will
receive
scrutiny
under
the
fourth
amendment
based
upon
the
issue
of
seizure
and
reasonableness.
the,
the
main
issue
from
our
point
of
view
is
whether
the
roadblock
can
act
as
a
seizure.
the
court
probably
noticed
that
i
didn't
really
address
that
directly
in
my...
in
my
brief.
i
think
i'm
ready
to
address
that
now
that
we
feel
that
for
a
roadblock--
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
--no.
and
it
wasn't
intentional.
really
it
was
a
matter
of
taking
time
to
formulate
the...
what
i
felt
was
the
appropriate
argument,
and
i...
i
didn't
feel
it
had
it
formulated
at
that
time.
but
i
feel
that
there
are
basically
four
elements
to
a
roadblock
being
a
seizure.
the
one
that
justice
scalia
pointed
out
that
it
has
to
be
intentional,
that
it
has
to
be
designed
to
cause
a--
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
--as
a--
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
--it
was
intentional
to
have
him
stop,
but...
but
not
by
a...
intentional...
intentional
to
have
someone
stop,
you
can
put
on
a
red
light,
turn
the
switch.
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
that,
that
indicates
an
intent--
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
--oh,
they
certainly
were.
to--
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
--intend
to
seize
him.
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
not
intent
to
seize,
but
the
issue...
intent
to
seize
by
the
use
of
a
collision
with
a
roadblock.
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
yes.
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
that's
right.
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
well,
that's
an
intentional
seizure,
but
it
doesn't
involve
the
use
of
deadly
force--
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
--well,
we're--
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
--that's
not...
that's
not--
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
well,
i
think
for...
i
have
trouble...
i
just
have
trouble
with
that.
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
the
use
of
deadly
force
goes
with...
with
reasonableness.
if
you
design
a
roadblock
as...
as
we
believe
that
there...
the
petitioner
is
trying
to
allege,
to
be
a
use
of
deadly
force
to
seize
somebody,
i'm
not
sure
how
you
would
seize
somebody
in
a
car
without
using
deadly
force.
you
have
a...
if
you
have
a
vehicle
going
down
a
highway
at
a
high
rate
of
speed,
maybe
some
day
they'll
come
up
with
a
way
to
seize
it
without
using
what
would
be
a
potentially
dangerous
force.
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
well,
i
would
assume
that
would
be
construed
as--
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
--as
deadly
force.
if
you
force
somebody
over--
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
--i
don't
know
if
they...
i
don't
know
that
officers--
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
--we
see
a
lot
of
things
in
the
movies.
but
i
feel
there
has
to
be...
it
has
to
be
an
intentionally
designed
roadblock,
intentional...
intentional
to...
to
cause
an
unavoidable
collision,
and
then
you
have
a
seizure
roadblock.
a
roadblock
that's
put
up
there
to
say
stop--
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
--well,
no.
oh,
no.
no,
it
could
be
very
reasonable.
i
think
it's
reasonable
to
stop
a
person
that
is
going
at
a
high
rate
of
speed.
justice
o'connor
referred
to
the
analogy
of
a
gun.
i
think
the...
in
the
tennessee
v.
garner
case,
but
in
this
case,
the
gun
is
not
pointed
at
the
officer.
the
gun
is
pointed
down
the
highway,
and
everyone
on
the
highway
is
held
hostage.
so,
it's
reasonable
to--
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
--if,
if
the...
because
the
volition...
the
reason
for...
if
the
reason
for
the
collision
has
to
do--
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
--well,
that...
that
can
be
reasonable,
and
a
roadblock--
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
--because
the,
the
roadblock
didn't...
if
it's
not
designed
to
cause
the
collision,
then
the
roadblock
is
not
the
seizure.
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
right.
and...
but
he
has
choices.
he
uses
volition.
if
he...
if
he
decides
to
run
into
it--
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
--i
think--
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
--the
seizure
is
when
he
does
submit
to
authority
or
when
he's
physically
restrained.
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
well,
i
don't
think
you
can.
i
don't
think
it
goes
that
far.
it
indicates
there
was
a
collision.
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
well,
we
don't
feel...
if
he...
he
had
no
choice,
then
it
has
to
be
shown
that
the
roadblock
was
intended
for
that
purpose.
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
intended
to
give
him
no
choice.
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
to
have
him
stop
voluntarily...
to
have
him
not
go
any
further
that
direction.
he
may
have
stopped
voluntarily.
he
may
have
decided
to
make
a
u-turn
and
go
the
other
way.
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
well,
the
stop
itself,
it's...
rather
than
trying
to
outrun...
to
run
around
the
roadblock
or
turn...
turn
around,
to
come
to
a
stop
without
running
into
the
roadblock.
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
for
the...
for
the
roadblock
to
be
the
seizure,
yes.
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
but
he
still
has
a
choice.
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
if
his
only
choice
is
to
stop,
he
still
has
a
choice
to
stop
and
not
run
into
the
roadblock.
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
of
course,
but--
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
--well,
when...
when
the
officer
turns
or
the
light,
isn't
he
telling
you
to
stop?
you
really
don't
have
any
other
choice
but
to
stop.
he
turns
on
the
red
light.
we
want
you
to
stop.
the
red
light
is
not
the
seizure.
we're
saying
the
roadblock
is
the
equivalent
to
the
red
light.
the
seizure
is
when...
when
in
fact
he
does
stop
when
the
police...
if
he
stops
and
runs,
the
roadblock
hasn't
seized
him.
he
just
changes
his
mode
of
escape.
the
only
time
the
roadblock
really
becomes
the...
the
seizure
rather
than
the
request
to
stop
is
when
it's
intentionally
designed
to
cause
the
unavoidable
collision.
and...
and
even
in
that
case,
if
there's
a
collision,
if
the
person
is
able
to
run
away,
they're
still
not
seized.
the
seizure--
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
that
a
collision
occurred.
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
well,
it
talks
about
concealed.
that...
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
it's--
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
--oh,
they...
they
definitely
are
in
the
complaint.
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
i'm
not...
i'm
not
disputing
what's--
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
--i'm
sorry.
i'm
sorry.
could
you
repeat
the
question?
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
oh,
i...
i'm
sorry.
i'm
not
saying
that.
if...
if...
if
in
fact--
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
--if
it
was
intentionally
set
up--
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
--then...
that's
what
i'm
saying.
then...
then
i
would
agree
there
would
be
a
seizure.
but
i
think
it
has
to
go
that
far,
otherwise...
otherwise
you're...
you're
allowing
the
suspect
to
decide
what
a
seizure
is--
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
--when
he
decides
to
run
the
roadblock,
but
catches
the
edge
of
the
roadblock--
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
--the
roadblock
is
not
the
seizure,
that
it's...
it's...
i'm
going
to
get
back
to
saying
reasonable.
i
don't
want
to
say
that.
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
there's...
there's
no
seizure
because
he
hasn't...
he
hasn't
stopped.
and
if...
if
he...
i
say
if
he
attempts
to
run
the
roadblock,
catches
a
fender
of
the...
of
the
vehicle,
spins
out,
we're
back
to
the...
the
galas
v.
mckee
situation
where
it's
his
own
volition
that...
that
caused
him
not
to
be
able
to
flee
any
longer.
it's
not
the
roadblock.
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
well,
i...
i
don't
think
that's
a
seizure,
your
honor.
i
think
the
seizure
takes...
is
a...
is
a
two-part
test.
you
have
the
communication
by
the
officer,
and
then
you
have
the...
the
resulting
conduct
of
the...
of
the
person.
if...
if
they
do
in
fact
submit,
if
they
say
you're
under
arrest,
and
you
say,
okay,
where...
where
do
i
go
or
if
they
start
to
run,
but
they're
grabbed,
they're
physically
restrained
or
they
submit
to
authority,
then
there's
a
seizure.
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
well--
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
--sure,
yes.
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
i
think
that's...
we
certainly--
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
--well,
we
feel
that
it...
that
it
should
indicate
that
it
was
intentionally
designed
to
cause
the
collision
and
that...
you
know,
obviously,
we'd
like
to
have
some
standards
for
roadblocks
in
the
future.
obviously,
the
next
part
we
feel
that
it
was
reasonable
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
well--
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
--yes,
okay.
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
well--
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
--i
agree.
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
that's
my
position,
yes.
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
not
a
fourth
amendment
seizure.
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
yes.
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
no.
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
no.
obviously,
if...
if
you
meet
both
tests,
then...
then...
then
it
would
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
yes.
i
think...
i
think
that
summarizes
it.
and
that's
what
not
alleged,
the...
the
unavoidability,
the
intentional
causing
of
the
collision.
we
know
there
was
a
collision.
that's
not
disputed.
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
i
don't
think...
i
don't
think
the
complaint
is
sufficient
on
that.
i
realize
it
may
come
close,
but
i
don't
feel
it's
sufficient
to
meet
the
standard
that...
that
that
was
the...
that
he
had
no
choice
but
to...
but
to
collide
with...
with
the
roadblock.
the
second
part
is
the
reasonableness.
to
say...
when
you
basically
have
the
motoring
public
held
hostage
by
the...
or
certainly
in
jeopardy
by
the
person
driving
at
the
high
speed,
that
it's
appropriate
to
put
up
a
roadblock,
even
a
roadblock
that's
designed
to...
to
catch
somebody
with
physical
force.
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
well,
i
think
we've
been...
we've
been
referring
to
it
inferentially,
at
least.
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
i
think
that's
the...
the
standard.
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
well,
i
think
in
this
case...
or
in
the
garner
case,
the...
the
court
referred
to,
in
footnote
7
i
believe
it
was,
the...
a
model
penal
code,
that
if
you
have
a
felon,
if
you
have...
in
this
case
a
fleeing
felon,
if
you
have
a...
a
substantial
risk
that
a
person
to
be
arrested
will
cause
death
or
serious
bodily
harm...
and
i
think
that
can
easily
be
inferred
from
the
fact
of
the
high
speed
chase
on
the...
on
the
highway.
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
if
the
apprehension
is
delayed,
then
it's
appropriate
to
use...
it's
reasonable
to
use
deadly
force.
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
yes.
i
think
a
roadblock
is
a
more
reasonable
way
to...
to
do--
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
--[inaudible].
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
that...
that...
that
deadly
force
could
be
used--
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
--[inaudible].
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
well,
that's
maybe
why
it's
more
appropriate
to
use
a...
to
use
a
roadblock,
but
deadly
force
could
be...
could
be
used.
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
that
seems
to
be
the
reasoning
in
tennessee
v.
garner
that...
that
deadly
force...
in
that
case
a
gun
was
used.
if
it...
if
he...
mr.
garner
had
been
fleeing
from
a
dangerous
felony
or
if
he
had
produced
a
gun,
a
gun
would
have
been
appropriate.
in
this
case
it
ended
up
being
vehicle
versus
vehicle,
and
felt
that
it
was
appropriate...
an
appropriate
response.
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
well,
there
certainly
is
a
difference
in
the
method
and
what's...
what
is
judged
is
the
method
of...
of
seizure.
that
didn't
happen.
the
court...
the
court
could
find
that
that
would
be
unreasonable--
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
--according
to
the...
to
the
complaint.
mr.
philip
w.
mcdowell
there
has
been
the
issue
of
the
pursuit.
we
also
feel
that
a...
that
a
pursuit
is
not
a...
is
not
a
seizure.
i
believe
that
issue
came
up
basically
because
of
the
recent
case
of
michigan
v.
chesternut.
and
again,
i
think
even
michigan
v.
chesternut
indicates
that
two-part
test.
there
has
to
be
the
communication
of...
of
an
intent
to
seize,
and
then
there
has
to
be
a
seizure.
and
in
the
chesternut
case,
there
was
a
seizure
initially,
the
seizure
of
the
drugs.
so,
you
had
both
things.
the
drugs
were
apparently
dropped
by
mr.
chesternut
in
response
to
the
communication
to
mr.
chesternut
that...
that
had...
in
that
case,
the
communication
wasn't
sufficient
to
be
a
seizure.
but
had
it
been,
had
there
been
sufficient
conduct
by
the
police
that
it
had
been
construed,
then
there
was
a
seizure
that
resulted.
so,
you
need...
you
need
the...
the
action
and
reaction
before
you...
before
you're
able
to
determine
that
there...
that
there
is
a
seizure.
if
the
reaction
is
to...
to
not
be
seized
and
to
flee,
it's...
it
certainly
is
counter-intuitive
to...
to
believe
that
a
seizure
occurred.
if
there's
no
further
questions,
i
think
i've
covered
our
side.
thank
you.
