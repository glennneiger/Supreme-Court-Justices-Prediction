chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
87-248,
georgia
brower
v.
the
county
of
inyo.
mr.
gilmore,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
what
i
thought.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
we
have
to
get
into
whether
the
chase
amounted
to
a
seizure
here
if
we
were
to
determine
that
the
existence
of
the
roadblock
resulted
in
a
seizure?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
if
you're
wrong
on
the
mendenhall
case,
you
could
nonetheless
prevail
on
the
idea
of
that
the,
the
forcing
the
guy
into
the
roadblock
was
a...
was
a
seizure.
that
would
be
sufficient
for
your
purposes,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
there...
as
i
read
the
petition
for
certiorari,
the
question...
there
is
no
question
as
to
reasonableness
presented.
it's
simply
the
vel...
seizure
vel
non.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
all
we're
talking
about
here
is
the
question
of
seizure,
you
will
still
have
to
persuade
someone
somewhere
that
it
was
an
unreasonable
seizure
in
order...
in
order
to
prevail.
so,
you
could
have
a...
this
court
could
hold
this
particular
roadblock
was
a
seizure
and
you
would,
nonetheless,
lose
your
case
if
it
were
found
to
be
a
perfectly
reasonable
seizure
under
the
fourth
amendment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
a
roadblock
by
itself
does
not
amount
to
a
seizure
if...
if
you've
got
some
alternate
route
to
go.
i
mean,
you
could
block...
you
could
block
a
road
for
purposes
of
repairing
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
your
argument
is
certainly
much
stronger,
it
seems
to
me,
when
you
combine
the
pursuit
and
the
roadblock.
when
you
start
talking
about
either
one
by
itself
as...
as
a
seizure,
i
think
you
get
into
trouble.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
gilmore.
mr.
mcdowell,
we'll
hear
from
you
next.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
didn't...
why
didn't
you
address
it
directly
in
your
brief?
ordinarily
you
don't
save
things
for
oral
argument--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
was.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
opposed
to
what
other
purpose?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
if
you
see
a
big
roadblock
up
ahead,
with
police
lights
flashing
and
so
on,
and
you
come
to
a
stop,
that
really
isn't
voluntary.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
for
it
to
be
a
seizure,
he
must
actually
run
into
the
roadblock?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
how
about
the
combination
of
the
pursuit
and
the
roadblock
where
the...
a
police
car
is
coming
after
him
from
behind
and
he
has
a
roadblock
in
front,
and
his
choices
narrow
very
rapidly--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that's
submitting
to
a
force
majeure,
really.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that's
still
not
a
seizure?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
if
someone
comes
up
to
you
in
an
airport,
to
use
something
from
one
of
yesterday's
cases,
a
dea
officer,
and
says
you're
under
arrest?
now,
you
have
an
opportunity,
an
option,
to
run
away
and
see
if
he
can
catch
you,
but
no
one
would
doubt
that
that's...
that's
a
seizure,
do
you
think?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mcdowell.
mr.
gilmore,
you
have
six
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gilmore.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
87-248
brower
versus
inyo
county
will
be
announced
by
justice
sacalia.
