well...
well,
then
can
we
pursue
that
just
one
minute?
suppose
a
police
car
slips
on
ice
accidentally
and
all
of
a
sudden
blocks
another
car
and
the
other
car
hits
the
police
cruiser.
that's
not
a
seizure,
is
it?
0....
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there's
an
intentional
component
to
the
element
of
seizure.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well...
well,
on
this
record
can't
you
find
that
he
didn't
have
a
choice?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
on...
on
this...
on
this
record,
it's
a
permissible
inference.
one
legitimate
inference
is
that
he
had
no
choice.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
can't
you--
--could
you
find
that
from
this
record?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
couldn't
you
find
that
from
this
record?
couldn't
a
trier
of
fact
find
that
if
all
of
the
allegations
of
the
plaintiff
are
believed,
that
this
roadblock
was
deliberately
constructed
in
order
to
cause
a
collision?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
take
it
the
test
you're
proposing
is
that
if
the
fugitive
has
the
ability
to
thwart
the
seizure,
then
there's
no
seizure.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
has
the
ability
to
thwart--
--well,
isn't
it
a
fair
reading
of
the
complaint
that
he
couldn't?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but,
counsel,
mendenhall
says
we
adhere
to
the
view
that
a
person
is
seized
only
when,
by
means
of
physical
force
or
a
show
of
authority,
his
freedom
of
movement
is
restrained.
now,
it
seems
to
me
quite
plausible
to
read
that
as
saying
that
if
the
person
does
not
choose
to
submit
to
the
restraint,
that
the
attempted
seizure
has
not
taken
place.
