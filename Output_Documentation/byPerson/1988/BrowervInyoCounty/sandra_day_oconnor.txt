mr.
gilmore,
even
if
we
were
to
agree
with
you
that
the
complaint
alleged
facts
sufficient
to
allege
a
seizure,
that
isn't
the
end
of
the
matter,
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
when
does
it
become
unreasonable
for
the
police
to
follow
someone
in
these
circumstances?
five
miles
down
the
road
or
10
miles
or
when?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
ever
an
obligation
that
the
police
have
to
stop
following
someone
in
these
circumstances?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
don't
you
think
that
creates
a
very
perverse
incentive
for
people
to
try
to
take
evasive
action
from
the
police
in
their
automobiles?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
this
is
more
than
that
because
when
this
person
takes
to
the
roads
on
a
two-lane
road
at
high
speed
trying
to
evade
police
action,
the
person
puts
a
lot
of
other
people
at
risk,
doesn't
he?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
yet,
you
think
the
police
have
to
break
off
the
pursuit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
gilmore,
if
the
person
pursued
in
this
case
by
the
police
had
drawn
a
gun
on
the
officer
and
threatened
to
shoot
him
and
then
took
off,
do
you
think
that
on...
on
those
facts
that
a
summary
judgment
could
be
granted
for
the
police?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let
me
ask
you
then
if
that
is
so,
whether
the
decedent
in
this
case
is
not
in
the
same
position.
he
is
armed
with
a
deadly
weapon,
in
effect,
the
vehicle,
and
is
engaged
in
aggressive
and
a
dangerous
course
of
action
in...
in
trying
to
take
evasive
action
and
flee.
why
isn't
that
like
the
person
drawing
the
gun?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
as
a
matter
of
law.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
person
is
in
effect
armed
with
this
vehicle
that
he
has
chosen
to
use
in
an...
in
an
aggressive
and
a
dangerous
manner
just
as
a...
a
deadly
weapon
such
as
a
gun.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
don't
you
think
it
did
exactly
that
at
night
on
a
two-lane
highway
at
high
speed
and
in
the
circumstances
we
know
here,
over
a
20-mile
course?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
the
state
takes
the
position
that
even
if
it
is
a
seizure,
as
a
matter
of
law,
it
was
reasonable
because
this
person
is
just
like
a
person
armed
with
a
gun.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
that
young
man
had
been
armed
with
a
gun,
however,
i
believe
our
opinion
in
garner
said
that
it
would
be
reasonable
to
shoot
him.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
that's
the
question,
whether
somebody
using
a
vehicle
in
the
manner
of
this
decedent
is
in
the
same
circumstance.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
mcdowell,
you
have
here
an
allegation
in
the
complaint
that
not
only
did
the
person
stop,
he
was
killed
in
the
process
by
virtue
of
a
roadblock
which
was
set
up
on
a
high-speed
chase.
now,
i
don't
see
anything
frightening
about
saying
that
amounts
to
a
seizure.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
suppose
you
can
defend
this
case
on
the
ground
that
what
was
done
was
reasonable.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
the
position
you
take?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
i
don't
understand
putting
20
minutes
of
argument
into
saying
this
isn't
a
seizure
on
the
facts
alleged
in
the
complaint.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you're
going
to
stick
with
that
no
matter
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you're
going
to
argue
the
reasonableness
of
it
or
not?
