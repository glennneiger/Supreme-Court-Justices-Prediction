mr.
gilmore,
when
do
you
think
the
seizure
took
place
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
it
was
unreasonable
at
that
point?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
the
police
officer
thinks
he's...
the
driver
is
driving
away
in
a
stolen
car,
it's
certainly
not
unreasonable
to
pursue
him,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
then
it
was
not
unreasonable
at
its
inception,
if
that
is
the
time
when
the
seizure
took
place.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
asked
you
when,
when
it
took
place.
you
said
then,
and
i,
i
think
you'd
have
a
hard
time
convincing
me
it
was
unreasonable
at
that
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
that
so?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't--
--what's
wrong
with
that?
i
just
don't
understand
that
argument.
your
question
presented
by
the
certiorari
petition
is
whether
the
roadblock
amounted
to
a
seizure.
those
are
the
two
questions.
both
questions
relate
to
the
roadblock,
and
i
don't
know
why...
and
when
you
do
get
to
the
issue
of
the
reasonableness...
you
can't
look
at
the
whole
picture.
i
just
don't
understand
your
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you're
entitled
to
look
at
them
all,
but
if
the
roadblock
is
enough
all
by
itself
just
on
the
issue
of
seizure,
why
make
your
case
harder
than
you
have
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
still
contend
the
roadblock
amounted
to
a
seizure?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
isn't
just
to
stop.
weren't
they
also
going
to
ask
him
to
get
out
and
take
him
down
to
the
station?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
they
intended
to
seize
him.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
there's
no
issue
about
intent
to
seize.
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
by
use
of
the
collision,
necessarily--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
by
use
of
the
roadblock.
the
roadblock
was
intended
to
stop
him
so
they
could
take
him
down
to
the
station.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
why
isn't
that
intentional
seizure?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
guy
got
killed,
didn't
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
often
turn
on
the
lights
and
pull
up
alongside
and
force
them
to
stop.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
don't
always
kill
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there
are
lots
of
time
don't
they...
don't
officers
force
people
over
on
to
the
curb
and
cause
them
to
stop
without
killing
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
do
it
in
the
movies
a
lot
anyway.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
intentional
component
of
a
seizure
must
be
you
have
to
intend
that
it
be
unreasonable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
maybe
it
isn't--
--[inaudible].
--perfectly
reasonable,
but
i
don't...
i
just
don't
understand
why
it's
not
a
seizure
and
why
it's
not
intentional.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
no.
the
reason
for
putting
up
the
roadblock
and
trying
to
stop
the
man.
justice
john
paul
stevens
sure,
it
could
be
reasonable,
but
why
isn't
it
perfectly
clear
it
was
intentional?
the
purpose
of
doing
it
was
to
cause...
to
apprehend
the
fleeing
felon.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
designed
to
cause
the
man
to
have
a
choice
between
either
stopping
and
being
arrested
or
running
into
it.
those
are
his
only
two
choices.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and...
and
you
think
one
of
those
choices
is
not
a
seizure?
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
the
one
hand,
you're
going
to
get
killed;
on
the
other
hand,
you're
going
to
get
hauled
down
to
the
station--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
think
that
the
officer
in
pursuit
could
have
just
shot
him
in
the
head,
and
that
would
have
been
reasonable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what?
that's
your
position,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
means
the...
that
the
officer
could
have
shot
him
in
the
head
and
that
would
be
a
reasonable
way
to
deal
with
the
situation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
if
you're
making
that
argument,
i
think
justice
white's
example
would...
you'd...
you'd
find
that
to
be
reasonable
because
you're
saying
driving
at
high
speed
on
a
highway
in
a
car
at
night
is
very
dangerous
and
therefore
you
can
use
deadly
force
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and,
analytically,
what
we
have
in
this
case
is
just
the
same
then
as
if
the
officer
had
driven
up
alongside
and
shot
the
man
in
the
head.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
one
can
infer
from
the
allegation
in
the
complaint
that
what
happened
was
pretty
close
to
that
because
according
to
the
complaint,
they
did
hide
the
trailer.
it
was
effectively
concealed
in
a
way
that
at
the
speed
the
man
was
traveling
driving
into
the
headlights,
he
wouldn't...
there's
no
chance
in
the
world
that
he
wouldn't
smash
into
it
and
at
that
speed,
get
killed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
complaint.
we...
i
don't
know
if
it's
true
or
not,
but
that's
what
they've
alleged,
and
we've
got
to
assume
it's
true.
