it
was
dismissed
purely
on
the
single
issue
of
seizure.

and
that
no,
no
one,
though
ever
got
to
the
question
reasonableness.

and
did
the...
did
the...
did
the
courts
below
specifically
deal
with
the
chase?
justice
byron

white
did
you
argue
that
the
chase
amounted
to
a
seizure?
justice

white
but
if
the...
i
suppose
you
could
say
that
the
officers
put
the
roadblock
up
there
to
stop
him.
and
if
he
had
skidded
to
a
stop
and
stopped
four

from
the

they

they
still
stopped
him.

--is
there
any
question
in
this
case
of
why
they
put
the
truck
up?
justice
byron

i
mean,
it
may...
it
may
not
amount
to
a
seizure,
but
it
was
certain...
whatever
it
was,
it
was
intentional.
justice

deadly
force
isn't
involved
in

deadly

isn't
an

in
whether
there's
a

not.

that

that
will

no,
it
says
the
roadblock
was
effectively
concealed,
doesn't
it?
justice

the

they're

yes.

well,
do
you
think...
well,
go
ahead
and
finish
answering
for
justice--
justice
byron

--but
do
you
think
they
could
have
shot
this
fellow?
justice
byron

you
just
drive
up
alongside
of
him
and
shoot
him.
yes.

he's
using
