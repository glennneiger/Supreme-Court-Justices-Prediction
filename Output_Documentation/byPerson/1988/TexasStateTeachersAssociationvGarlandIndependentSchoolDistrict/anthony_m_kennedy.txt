counsel,
suppose
you
had
two
lawsuits,
two
different
school
districts.
one
was
the
lawsuit
we
rave
before
us.
the
second
hypothetical
case
is
a
lawsuit
in
which
the
teachers
bring
suit
on
just
the
claim
that
you
brought
here
where
you
prevailed.
and
assume
the
hours
spent
on
just
the
prevailing
claim
are
the
same.
is
the
fee
same?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
under...
but
i
want
to
know
the
answer
to
my
question.
under
your
theory...
under
your
theory,
assume
the
discretionary
factors
are
all
the
same
except
for
the
fact
that
in
case
number
one,
your
case,
there
were
claims
on
which
you
did
not
prevail.
should
the
fee
be
the
same?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
another
way
of
saying...
another
way
of
saying
it
is
can
the
judge
discount
for
the
fact
that
you
had
some
claims
on
which
you
did
not
prevail.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
had
the
regulation
been
declared
facially
overbroad
and
invalid
or
invalid
as
applied,
or
was
the
opinion
not
clear
on
the
point?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
its
face.
