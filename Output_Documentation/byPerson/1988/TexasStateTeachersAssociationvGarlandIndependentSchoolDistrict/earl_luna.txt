mr.
earl
luna
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
for
us
to
look
at
some
of
the
facts
that
counsel
didn't
cover
here
and
that
is
that
the
texas
legislature
had
passed
a
statute
that...
21.904
of
the
texas
education
code...
that
said
no
school
district,
board
of
education,
superintendent,
assistant
superintendent,
principal
or
other
administrator
benefiting
by
funds
provided
for
in
this
code
shall
directly
or
indirectly
require
or
coerce
any
teacher
to
join
any
group,
club,
committee,
organization
or...
or
association.
as
a
result
of
that,
the
school
board
passed
this
regulation
which
simply
said
that
you
won't
promote
these
organizations
during
school
hours.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
there
are
administrators...
there
are
administrators
who
belong
to
the
organization,
just
like
there
are
other
people.
so,
if
we
had
a
policy
that
said
administrators
can
call
meetings
and
talk
to
people
about
joining
the
association
and...
and
recruiting
members,
we'd
be
in
violation
of
state
law.
now,
they
didn't
attack
the
state
law.
the
state
law
is
not
attacked
in
this
lawsuit
at
all.
so,
as
the
law
was
passed
and
the
regulations
begin
to
be
established
this
case...
he
says
it
was
one
that
could
be
settled.
this
was
brought
as
a
test
case.
they
brought
in...
and
the
record
here
shows
nine
of
their...
what
they
call
uniserve
people
from
all
over
the
state
and
descended
upon
46
schools
in
this
school
district
and
covered
most
of
them
in
a
period
of
two
days
in
groups
of
one
and
two.
and
they
made
demands
during
the
school
day
to
talk
to
the
teachers,
said
they
had
a
first
amendment
right
of
assembly
and
speech.
and
we
took
many
depositions.
he
talks
about
the
amount
of
work.
all
of
these
people
were
outside
association
members
except
one
of
these
nine
people
that
made
this
trip.
one
of
them
was
one
of
our
teachers,
but
we
took
depositions
of
all
of
the
eight
others
and
of
many,
many
principals
in
preparing
for
this
case.
now,
none
at
those...
if
he
had
brought...
if
he
had
brought
a
lawsuit
just
for
the
part
that
he's
talking
about,
those...
eight
of
those
nine
wouldn't
have
been
there
because
that
wouldn't
have
been
important
to
this
case
to
begin
with.
but
by
bringing
it
this
way,
it's
an
attempt
to
build
a
great
fee
perhaps
like
the
one
in
the
riverside
case.
and
we
believe
that
that's
not
the
intent
of
the
legislation
in
this
case.
now,
as
they...
as
they
went
to
the...
as
the
depositions
showed
they
were
asked
is
there
anything
else
that
you
claim.
now,
they
set
out
some
specific
things
in
their
complaint
that
they
complained
about,
but
they
didn't
set
out...
and
it
didn't
show
up
until
summary
judgment...
this
portion
about
the
discussion
of
teacher
to
teacher.
now,
and
even
in
their
motion
for
summary
judgment,
they
said
it
wasn't
clear
what
the
school's
position
was
on
that.
now,
the
only
information
they
have...
and
we
think,
by
the
way,
there
is
a
question
as
to
whether
there
could
be
a
prevailing
party
in
this
case
under
any
circumstances
because
this
is
little
more
than
what
this
court
has
referred
to
as
an
advisory
opinion
because
we
were
talking
about
things
in
the
future.
none
of
these
things
had
happened,
and
they
arose
in
a
deposition.
what
if
somebody
said
so
and
so?
so,
there
had
been
no
dispute.
there
was
no
case
in
controversy
between
the
parties
on
this
issue.
and
these
what-if
questions
were
asked
of
some
down-the-totem-pole
administrators
who
were
not
policy
makers
of
the
school
district.
and,
of
course,
this
court
has
recently
held
that
it's...
it
has
got
to
be
something...
it
has
got
to
be
a
policy
maker
that
makes
the
decision.
therefore,
there
couldn't
have
been
any
liability
on
the
school
district
for
the
mistaken
belief,
if
it
was
mistaken
belief,
of
some
of
these
administrators.
and
under
mccluskey,
of
course,
the...
the
school
board
itself
is
the
one
who
would
interpret
its
regulation.
they
really
didn't
take
the
school
board's
deposition,
but
they
did
take
the
superintendent's.
and
they
asked
him.
in
his
deposition,
he
said
that
we
don't
have
any
regulation
that
keeps
teachers
from
talking
to
each
other
about
tsta
at
lunch.
we
don't
have
any
regulation
that
keeps
them
from
talking
about
it
on
their
break.
now,
as
i
say,
they
did
ask
in
deposition
some
of
the
other
principals,
well,
what
if
this
happened.
well,
i
don't
know,
but
i
guess
it
would
be
a
violation.
and
that
speculation
is
the
only
thing
that
is
in
this
record
that
they
claim
to
have
gotten
relief
on.
mr.
earl
luna
yes.
mr.
earl
luna
yes,
i
do.
the
reason--
mr.
earl
luna
--no.
i
think
there
probably
are
a
majority
of
the
other
courts
of
appeals
that
have
said
otherwise.
but
let
me
just
move,
if
i
might,
then
to
that
central
issue
case.
and
the
reason
we
think
that
the...
first
of
all,
in
ruckelshaus,
we
think
this
court
didn't
adopt
the
first
circuit's
rule.
the
court
simply
referred
to
that
first
circuit
rule
as
a
very
generous
rule.
and
the
court
also
referred
to
a
number
of
other
rules
that
were
in
use
in
the
circuit
including
the
fifth
circuit
rule
of
the
central
issue.
and
i
think
it
might
be
well
to
look
at
where
that
fifth
circuit
rule
came
from.
it
came
right
out
of
the
congressional
history
of
this
very
statute.
in
the
congressional
history
in
this
statute
when
dorothy
parker...
parker
v.
matthews...
brought
a
suit
in
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia,
the
case
was
settled.
and
then
in
the
district
court's
opinion,
it
discussed,
first,
what's
a
prevailing
party
and...
and
what's
the
criteria
for
it.
and
the
district
court
in
that
case
said...
they
brought
up
the
central
issue,
said
the
central
issue
is
the
way
you
tell
a
prevailing
party,
and
had
a
good
deal
of
discussion
on
it,
but
noted
there
are
no
cases.
and
they
came
up
with...
from...
and
took
it
from
a
black
law
dictionary.
now,
the
committee
in
the
congressional
history
mentioned
that
case
when
they
talked
about
the
prevailing
party
and
the
central
issue
and
how
you
set
attorney
fee.
now,
the
petitioners
here
say,
oh,
but
they
only
mentioned...
they
only
cited
that
case
because
it
was
settled
to
show
that
there
could
be
a
recovery
for
settlement.
that's
not
the
reason
they
mentioned
that
case.
that
case
went
up
on
appeal
and
was
affirmed
in
parker
v.
califano.
now,
if
the
court
had
just
been
wanting
to
note
that
it
mentioned
the
settlement,
they
could
have
cited
the
court
of
appeals
case.
they
cited
three
cases
in...
in
the
congressional
history
on...
at
that
point
including
another
circuit
court
case
which
also
talked
about
settlement,
but
did
not
discuss
central
issue.
the
only
one
of
them
that
cited...
that
discussed
the
central
issue
was
the
district
court
case
in
parker
v.
matthews,
which
was
later
parker
v.
califano.
and
the...
we
think
that
the
reason
they
didn't
cite
the
court
of
appeals
is,
as
i
say,
on
appeal
they
didn't
discuss
the
central
issue.
but
the...
the
committee
was
well
aware
of
the
central
issue
and
talked
in
terms
of
it's
something
to
protect
people
who
have
a
valid
civil
rights
case,
and...
and
it
is
not
something
to
build
attorney
fees
for
attorneys.
mr.
earl
luna
yes.
i
think
it
would
not
be
material
if...
if
a
plaintiff
had
a
central
issue,
a
main
civil
rights
suit,
but
had
something...
added
something
to
it--
mr.
earl
luna
--yes.
mr.
earl
luna
i
don't...
i
don't
think
that
the
defendant
is
going
to
recover
in
that
kind
of
case.
if
so,
the
plaintiff
is
going
to
recover,
and
it
would
be
at
most
some
offset
under...
under
this
court's
decisions
where
we
said
that
you've
got
to...
you
can
only
recover
for
the
work
that
you've
done.
it
might
be
an
offset,
but
certainly
no
recovery
for
the
defendant
if
the
plaintiff
recovered
on
the
central
issue.
i
see
no
reason
for
the
plaintiff
to
recover.
now,
if
we
take
a
look
then
at
why
would
the
court
in
a
case
like
this
now
say
that
hensley
v.
eckerhart
did
not
foreclose
the
issue
and
decide
it...
that's
what
petitioners
claim.
yet,
this
court
two
or
three
months
later,
that...
after
deciding
hensley
v.
eckerhart
on
may
16,
1983,
decided
ruckelshaus
v.
sierra
club.
and
in
that
case
where
the
statute
was
different
and
said
that
the
court
could
set
attorney
fees
where
appropriate,
they...
the
court
said
that
that
is
different.
this
court
said
that
is
different
from
the
standard
that
is
used
in
the
prevailing
issue
case.
but
even
then
the
court
says
there
has
to
be
some
recovery.
there
has
to
be
some
prevailing
in
order...
in
order
for
them
to
recover
it,
but
not
as
much
as
in
a
statute
with
the
prevailing
party.
so,
if
this
was
a
suit
that
was
brought
under
the
epa
statute,
the
plaintiffs
might
be
in
a
different
position
that
they're
in
here
because
this
court
noticed
that
there
was
a
difference
in
those.
and
those...
and
if
the
prevailing
issue
was
decided,
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
need
for
the
distinction
that
was
mace
in
the
ruckelshaus
case.
now,
we
think
also
that
there
is...
another
very,
very
important
thing
has
developed
in
this
case
or
failed
to
developed.
after
the
fifth
circuit
made
its
decision
on
the
merits
of
this
case
the
first
time,
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
if
that
statute...
if
that
regulation
was
decided
as...
as
somebody
might
say
that
in
the
future.
if
it
was
decided
that
way,
it
was
unconstitutional.
now,
they
reversed
then
in
part
and
remanded
for...
for
further
proceedings
and
not
inconsistent
with
the
court's
opinion.
they
did...
on
the
holding
then
that
if
it
was
done
that
way,
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
now,
it
was
reversed
for
further
proceedings.
and
that's
the
time
when
it
was
appealed.
it
was
rather
suspected
that
the
petitioners
in
this
case
would,
when
it
got
back
to
the
district
court,
ask
as
they
had
in
their...
in
their
petition
originally
maybe
for
nominal
damages
or
for
an
injunction
to
keep
it
from
being
enforced
that
way.
now,
the
plaintiffs,
though,
apparently
recognized
that
there
was
really
no
merit
and
that
they
had
really
gotten
nothing
from
the
court
of
appeals.
so,
when
we
got
back
to
the
district
court,
they
don't
ask
for
anything.
they
didn't
ask
for
any
further
relief
except
attorney
fees.
mr.
earl
luna
well,
the...
the
district
court
opinion
held
that
it
was...
that
it
was
overbroad
only
in
that
one
little
area
that
they
admit
doesn't
amount
to
anything.
now,
the...
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
it
was
unconstitutional
in
a
very
limited
way,
that
if
it
kept...
where
it
kept
the
teachers
from
talking
to
each
other
about
organizations,
time
off
and
so
forth,
that
under
those
circumstances,
the
fifth
circuit
said
it
was
unconstitutional.
now,
the
fifth
circuit
disagreed--
mr.
earl
luna
--well,
not
on
its...
i
don't
believe
on
its
face.
they
said
that
there
was
no
testimony
to
show.
they
said
there
was
no
testimony
to
show
that
the
administrators
would
not
enforce
it
that
way.
so,
i
don't
believe
they
said
it
was
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
only
as
applied...
if
applied
in
that
hypothetical
manner.
there
was...
there
was
no
holding
that
it
was
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
now,
so
based
on
the...
see,
the...
the
fifth
circuit
applied
the
summary
judgment
rule
most
favorable
to
them,
and...
and
then
still
affirmed
the
summary
judgment
except
in
that
narrow
area,
and
then
turned
around,
using
the
same
standard,
and
granted
a
partial
summary
judgment
for
them
on
that
as
applied
theory.
but
when
we
got
back,
after
it
was
appealed
to
this
court,
they
didn't
ask
for
any
more
relief,
only
for
attorney
fees.
and
the
court
again
found
that
they
didn't
recover
anything,
and
that
they
were
not
entitled
to
attorney
fees
and
the...
the
court
costs
were
attacked...
were
taxed
against
the
petitioners.
and
on
appeal,
they
didn't
at
that
time
challenge
that
portion
of
the
court's
decision.
so,
we
think
then
that
that
brings
it
very
close
to
the
facts
of
hewitt
v.
helms
where
the
plaintiff
didn't
recover
anything.
now,
the
difference
in...
in
this
one
and
helms,
of
course,
was
that
in
the
helms
case,
the
court
had
instructed
them
to
enter
a
summary
judgment
on
damages
unless
there
has
some
immunity.
now,
they
didn't
get
that
summary
judgment
entered
when
it
went
back.
and
this
court
pointed
out
in
that
case
that
at
the
end
of
the
rainbow
lies
not
a
judgment,
but
some
action
for...
or
cessation
of
action
by
the
defendant
that
the
judgment
produces
the
payment
of
damages
or
some
specific
performance
or
the
termination
of
some
conduct.
now,
we
had
even
applied
to
stay
that
first
order
while
we
appealed
up
here
to
this
court
so
it
wouldn't
go
back
to
the
district
court
and...
what
we
feared...
ask
for
some
affirmative
relief.
and
then
after
this
court
denied
the
appeal
and
it
got
back
to
the
district
court,
they
still
didn't
ask
for
any
affirmative
relief.
so,
we
believe
that
this
case
comes
right
in
the
decision
of
the
hewitt
case
because
there
is
no
dispute.
there
wasn't
any
dispute
between
the
parties
on
this.
this
has
something
that
had
not
happened,
but
the
fifth
circuit
says,
if
it
does,
there's
no
evidence
that
you
wouldn't
enforce
it
this
way.
so,
there
really
had
never
been
a
dispute
on
that.
therefore,
it...
they...
there
was
no
dispute
which
affects
the
behavior
of
the
defendant
toward
the
plaintiff.
now,
there
would
have
been
while
this
case
was
being
appealed
had
they
applied
to
the
district
court
for
injunctive
relief
and
gotten
it.
we
would
have
had
to
change
the
policy.
but
they
didn't
do
that,
and
they
didn't
do
it
after
the
appeal
is
over.
so,
as
the
posture
of
the
case
is
before
this
court,
they
received
no
judgment
that
affected
any
action
that
any
of
the
parties
to
this
case
have
to
take...
or
that
is,
that
the
defendant
has
to
take.
no
action
at
all.
no
order
was
entered
by
the
trial
court.
and
it's
not
a
place
to
complain
about
here,
but
the
interesting
thing
about
it
was
the...
the
circuit
court
disagreed
with
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
trial
court
and
made
some
findings
notwithstanding--
mr.
earl
luna
--yes,
all
right.
it
does
not,
your
honor.
in
the
case
now
where
he's...
they're
continuing
to
ask
for
attorney
fees,
and
the
main
thing
they're
asking...
they're
complaining
about
is...
or
one
of
the
things
they're
complaining
about,
of
course,
is
the
mail.
under
this
regulation,
they
could...
could
put
a
stamp
on
it
and
send
anything
they
wanted
to
to
the
teachers
through
the
intra-school
mail.
now,
they
don't
want
to
do
that.
they
wanted
to
take
it
all
to
the
superintendent's
office
and
have
it
delivered
through
the
intra-school
mail
to
the
teachers.
now,
of
course,
since
then,
this
court
has
heard
the...
and
decided
the
case
of
regents
versus...
california
v.
the
public
employment
relations
board,
and
that
now
is
not
even
something
that
they
would
be
permitted
to
do...
use
that
intra-school
mail.
so,
part
of
their
case
of
what
they
claimed
to
win
is
out
the
window
because
of
the
university
of
california
case.
so,
we
think
that
the
petitioners
have
not
shown
that
they
have
made
any
recovery
in
this
case
that
changed
any
conduct
of...
or
required
the
change
of
any
conduct
of
the
defendant
that
the
defendant
was
carrying
on.
now,
they
will
say,
yes,
you
can't
stop
the
teachers
from
talking
to
each
other
at
lunch
about
this.
now,
the
testimony
showed
we
never
tried
to
stop
them.
that
had
never
been
done.
and
you
can't
stop
them
from
talking
and...
during
the
classroom...
or
during
their
off-period
when
they're
not
working.
and
the
testimony
showed
that
had
never
been
done.
the
most
it
showed
was
there
was
no
affirmative
testimony
saying
we
wouldn't
do
it
if,
in
fact,
it
had
happened.
thank
you
very
much.
appreciate
it.
