mr.
robert
h.
chanin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
by
this
case
concerns
the
standard
to
be
used
in
determining
whether
a
plaintiff
is
a
prevailing
party
for
purposes
of
the
civil
rights
attorney's
fee
awards
act,
section
1988.
the
parties
urge
two
alternative
standards.
the
respondents
contend
that
the
correct
standard
is
the
one
used
by
the
fifth
and
eleventh
circuits.
it
is
referred
to
as
the
central
issue
standard
under
which
a
plaintiff
must
prevail
on
the
central
issue
by
acquiring
the
primary
relief
sought.
on
the
basis
of
this
standard,
the
court
below
held
the
petitioners
in
this
case
were
not
prevailing
parties
and,
therefore,
ineligible
for
any
fee
award.
the
standard
urged
by
petitioners
was
initially
articulated
by
the
first
circuit
in
nadeau
v.
heigemoe
in
1978.
it
is
currently
used
by
courts
of
appeal
in
11
circuits,
and
it
was
characterized
by
this
court
as
a
typical
formulation
in
hensley
v.
eckerhart
in
1983.
it
is
referred
to
as
the
significant
issue
standard
which
establishes
plaintiffs
as
prevailing
parties
if
they
succeed
on
any
significant
issue
in
litigation
which
achieves
some
of
the
benefits
the
parties
sought
in
bringing
suit.
let
me
note
at
the
outset
that
the
question
as
to
the
correct
standard
for
prevailing
party
status
does
not
in
and
of
itself
relate
directly
to
the
amount
of
fees
that
ultimately
should
be
awarded
to
a
plaintiff.
the
standard
at
issue
here
is
only
the
first
stage
of
a
two-stage
process.
it
is
a
threshold
standard
to
establish
an
eligibility
for
fees.
if
a
plaintiff
succeeds
in
crossing
that
threshold,
the
actual
amount
of
fees
to
which
he
is
entitled
is
determined
by
the
district
court
after
considering
various
factors,
particularly
the
degree
of
success.
to
put
this
another
way,
there
is
no
dispute
here
about
the
fact
that
the
results
obtained
is
a
crucial
factor
in
the
application
of
section
1988.
the
dispute
concerns
the
stage
of
the
process
at
which
this
factor
should
have
its
primary
impact.
should
it
be
at
the
threshold
eligibility
stage
to
deny
prevailing
party
status
to
a
partially
prevailing
plaintiff
and
totally
preclude
any
fee
award,
which
is
the
respondents'
position?
or
should
it
have
its
primary
impact
at
the
second
stage
after
prevailing
party
status
has
been
achieved
in
determining
the
amount
of
reasonable
fees
in
light
of
the
results
obtained?
this
is
the
petitioners'
position.
in
order
to
establish
a
framework
for
addressing
this
question,
it
is
appropriate
to
begin
with
a
brief
review
of
the
facts
in
this
case,
particularly
since
the
briefs
of
the
respondents
and
their
supporting
amici
present
such
a
distorted
picture
of
the
merits
outcome.
this
case
involves
a
regulation
adopted
by
a
public
school
district
in
texas,
the
garland
independent
school
district...
i'll
refer
to
it
as
gisd...
which
prohibited
all
communications
regarding
employee
organizations
on
school
grounds
at
any
time
during
the
school
day,
including
teachers'
lunch
break,
non-class
periods
and
other
free
time.
the
regulation
covered
face-to-face
discussions
and
also
prohibited
any
use
of
the
school
district's
communications
facilities,
bulletin
boards,
teachers'
mailboxes,
pa
systems.
those
were
all
precluded
to
disseminate
any
information
regarding
employee
organizations.
this
prohibition
applied
to
communications
by
and
among
the
teachers
themselves,
as
well
as
the
communications
by
outside
representatives
of
employee
organizations.
the
petitioners
filed
a
1983
action
and
succeeded
in
having
the
regulation
struck
down
as
it
applied
to
teacher-to-teacher
communications
and
as
it
applied
to
the
gisd's
communications
facilities
by
the
teachers
themselves.
we
were
unsuccessful
in
regard
to
the
prohibition
against
communications
by
outside
representatives.
we
considered
this
to
be
a
significant
victory,
and
judging
by
the
vigorous
efforts
of
the
respondents
to
overturn
the
ruling,
so
did
they.
they
left
no
stone
unchallenged
in
seeking
to
reverse
this
ruling,
including
ultimately
an
appeal
to
this
court
which
summarily
affirmed
the
fifth
circuit
on
the
merits
in
1986.
in
the
course
of
its
efforts
to
reverse,
the
respondents
did
something
else.
they
also
made
clear
what
this
ruling
meant
in
practical
terms.
they
repeatedly
emphasized
before
the
lower
courts
and,
indeed,
before
this
court
that
invalidation
of
the
teacher
portion
of
the
regulation
would
require
substantial
modification
on
the
school
district's
policies
and
procedures.
and
that
is,
in
fact,
what
happened.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
as
a
result
of
this
ruling,
teachers
now
have
the
right
to
discuss
and
promote
employee
organizations
during
their
free
time.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
well,
your
honor,
i
think
you're
referring
to
a...
a
minor
point
of
victory
in
this
case,
and
the
answer
to
your
question
is
it
would
fall
below
the
threshold.
but
let
me
clarify
what
i
am
talking
about
as
our
victory
and
what
i
think
you
are
referring
to.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
in
the
course
of
this
broad-based
regulation
that
we
challenged,
there
was
a
provision
that
said
meetings
could
be
held
before
school
opened,
8:00
a.m.
in
the
morning,
and
after
school
at
3:45.
and
it
said
that
it
would
be
up
to
the
school
principal
to
determine
whether
or
not
to
grant
access
for
those
meetings.
that
was
the
only
thing
struck
down
by
the
district
court
as
too
vague
because
there
were
no
standards.
that
was
not
appealed.
it
had
no
practical
impact
because
the
record
indicates
we
never
had
been
denied
a
pre-school
or
post-school
meeting.
if
i
had
to
pick
a
threshold,
that
falls
below
it.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
no.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
absolutely.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
we
come--
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
--we...
we
come--
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
--before
this
court
in
this
posture.
we
have
prevailed,
according
to
the
fifth
circuit,
on
a
secondary
issues
of
significance.
the
fifth
circuit
has
said
that
ain't
good
enough.
it
was
not
the
central
issue.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
i
certainly
hope
not,
your
honor--
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
--because
we
are
satisfied
with
that.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
the
reason
we
present
it
is
because
it
does
tie
into
our
analysis
and
the
respondents
go
out
of
their
way
to
downplay
the
significance
of
what
we
won.
but
let
me
accept
that
we
did
win
on
a
significant
issue,
the
court
held
it
was
not
central,
and
move
on.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
because
if
you
focused
on
the
word
"the"
and
you
said
there
can
only
be
one
prevailing
party,
i
suggest
it
would
be
a
far
too
rigid
and
wooden
reading
of
the
statute
inconsistent
with
numerous
prior
holdings
of
this
court,
inconsistent
with
the
legislative
history
as
well.
let
me
give
you
just
one
example.
both
this
court
and
the
legislative
history
have
made
it
clear
that
fee
awards
are
appropriate
pendente
lite,
at
an
interim
stage.
and
they
made
those
references
in
the
course
of
complex
institutional
civil
rights
cases
which
are
ongoing,
where
issues
change,
where...
where
objectives
and
goals
change
as
the
litigation
goes
on.
it
is
quite
impossible
at
that
point
to
know
if
a
plaintiff
who
has
won
on
an
interim
matter,
when
all
the
smoke
clears,
will
ultimately
be
the
prevailing
plaintiff
in
the
entire
lawsuit.
the
cases
that
this
court
has
decided,
including
the
ones
that
pick
up
that
language
from
the
legislative
history,
make
it
clear
that
there
can
be
multiple
prevailing
parties
in
a
case,
and
it
has
never
focused
on
the
word
1988
format
or
in
connection
with
other
statutes
that
similarly
use
the
word
"the".
after
this
court's
summary
affirmance--
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
--i
think
once
the
standard
is
established,
if
the
plaintiff
fails
to
meet
that
standard,
the
defendant
could
be
the
prevailing
party.
you
threw
in
the
question
of
fees,
and
i
do
want
to
just
clarify
that.
i
think
the
defendant
could
be
the
prevailing
party
certainly
for
cost
purposes.
whether
or
not
the
defendant
would
be
the
prevailing
party
for
fee
purposes
brings
in
an
entirely
different
standard
as
this
court
has
developed
under
christiansburg.
he
would
only
be
the
prevailing
party
if
what
we
had
presented
as
the
plaintiffs
was
frivolous,
groundless
or
without
merit.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
it
was
not,
but
the
doctrine
of
christiansburg
has
been
applied
to
1988.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
by
this
court
in
hensley,
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
in
a
footnote
in
hensley,
it
specifically
applied
it.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
yes.
i
think
that
is
the
extension
of
hensley.
all
the
court
said
in
hensley--
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
--yes.
i
think...
i
think
it
is--
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
--i
think
it
is...
it
is
where
i
am...
i
am
prepared
to
go.
what
the
court
said
in
hensley
was
that
when
you
have
one
lawsuit
with
legally
distinct
claims
that
can
be
separated,
that
are
unrelated,
you
can
have
a
prevailing
plaintiff
and
a
prevailing
defendant
on
frivolous,
groundless
issues.
i
would
concede
that
even
if
they
are
related
issues,
conceptually
you
could
have
a
prevailing
plaintiff
on
a
significant
issue
and
a
defendant
if
included
with
those
are
related
frivolous,
groundless
issues.
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
could
i...
the
answer
on
that
would
be
it
would
have
to
be
determined
by
the
district
court
in
its
discretion.
but
if
i
may,
your
honor,
you've
put
your
finger
on
what
is
the
ultimate
absurdity
of
the
central
issue
rule.
and
if
i
may
just
take
your
example
and
run
with
it
a
little
bit.
after
extensive
litigation
here,
we
succeeded
in
having
the
regulation
declared
unconstitutional
in
significant
respects.
and
in
that
sense,
we
vindicated
important
congressional
policies
under
the
civil
rights
laws.
had
that
been
the
only
issue
in
this
case,
there
is
no
dispute
that
we
would
have
been
a
prevailing
plaintiff
even
in
the
fifth
circuit
entitled
to
an
attorney's
fee.
now,
what...
the
amount
of
the
attorney's
would
be
determined
in
the
second
stage
of
the
process
at
the
discretion
of
the
district
court.
however,
because
we
chose
to
include
a
second
related
issue,
which
i
might
note
the
district
court
specifically
found
was
certainly
not
frivolous
or
brought
in
bad
faith,
and
because
we
failed
to
prevail
on
that
second
issue,
we
were
denied
any
fees
even
for
the
issue
on
which
we
succeeded.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
we--
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
--i
think
under
hensley
the
judge
certainly
has
the
authority
to
discount
for
that
and,
applying
the
hensley
factors,
might
well
do
so.
it
is
our
position
that
these
were
closely
related
issues
and
that
the
work
put
in
on
the
one
impacted
and
led
to
the
success
on
the
other.
so,
we
would
certainly
argue
before
the
district
court
that
it
should
exercise
its
discretion
to
give
us
a
full
amount
of
our
fee
award.
but
the
district
court
certainly
has
discretion
and
might
well
discount
it.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
absurd
because
i
think
it's
directly
contrary...
what
you
suggest
is
directly
contrary
to
the
intent
of
congress
in
passing
section
1988.
as
this
court
observed
very
recently,
last
week,
in
blanchard,
in
order
to
advance
congress'
purpose
under...
enacting
section
1988
civil
rights
attorneys
should
be
encouraged
to
explore
all
possible
avenues
of
relief
in
their
efforts
to
vindicate
the
high
priority
policies
of
congress.
and
the
court
cautioned.
it
cautioned
against
artificial
incentives
that
could
skew
the
way
civil
rights
cases
are
structured
and
put
forth.
we
submit
that
based
upon
what
you
have
said,
the
central
issue
standard
would
create
an
economic
disincentive
which
could
have
precisely
that
effect.
it
could
cause
and
deter
civil
rights
attorneys
from
providing
the
type
of
effective
representation
that
this
court
called
for
in
blanchard.
because
of
the
inherent
difficulty
in
determining
what
is
the
central
issue
and
the
uncertainty
as
to
what
some
courts
may
hold
in
that
regard,
the
economic
self-interest
of
the
attorneys
could
motivate
them
to
press
only
those
claims
which
look
like
sure-fire
winners
or
have
a
strong
likelihood
of
success
and
abandon
issues
that
are
somewhat
more
problematic
even
though
they
are
bona
fide,
can
be
supported
by
a
good
faith
argument
for
an
extension
or
modification
or
even
a
reversal
of
the
law.
if
you
included
those
issues
in
your
hypothetical,
we
run
the
risk
that
we
wilt
lose
all
fees
even
for
those
issues
on
which
we
are
successful.
i
think
this
possibility
is
not
a
positive.
i
think
it
distorts
artificially
the
way
civil
rights
attorneys
would
prepare,
present
and
handle
cases,
be
contrary
to
this
court's
admonition
in
the
blanchard
case
and
be
contrary
to
the
legislative
history.
the
significant
issue
standard
avoids
that
problem
and
would
not,
as
your
question
may
also
imply,
encourage
the
inclusion
of
non-meritorious
or
insubstantial
claims
in
civil
rights
lawsuits.
i
think
the
framework
that
this
court
has
established
for
applying
section
1988
provides
ample
safeguards
against
that
possibility.
thus,
for
example,
if
we
assert
issues
and
include
issues
that
are
unreasonable
or
groundless,
we
may
be
required
under
christiansburg
to
pay
the
fees
to
the
defendants.
i
submit
to
you
that
is
a
powerful
deterrent.
moreover,
under
hensley,
even
as
prevailing
plaintiffs,
we
may
be
denied
fees
for
time
spent
on
non-frivolous
issues
raised
in
good
faith,
but
we
did
not
succeed.
this
is
a
further
incentive
for
plaintiffs
attorneys
to
consider
very
carefully
the
kinds
of
issues
they
include.
but
there
is
a
major
difference
between
the
concepts
embodied
in
christiansburg
and
the
concepts
embodied
in
hensley
which
are
designed
to
motivate
responsible
action
by
attorneys
for
civil
rights
plaintiffs
and
the
central
issue
standard
which
threatens
to
impose
a
financial
penalty
for
providing
precisely
the
type
of
effective
representation
that
congress
intended
and
this
court
has
called
for.
let
me,
if
i
may,
pick
up
on
hensley
v.
eckerhart
because
we
believe
and
most
courts
of
appeals
believe
that
that
case
resolved
this
question
and
put
to
bed
the
question
of
the
standard
to
be
applied
in
determining
who
was
a
prevailing
party
for
purposes
of
1988.
the
issue
in
hensley
was
whether
prevailing...
a
party
who
had
prevailed
in
part
could
recover
legal
fees
for
the
services
rendered
on
unsuccessful
claims.
in
answering
that
question,
hensley
established
a
comprehensive
analytical
framework
to
assure
that
civil
rights
plaintiffs
obtain
fee
awards
that
are
reasonable
in
relation
to
the
results
obtained.
the
framework
involved
a
two-stage
process.
a
plaintiff
who
achieves
only
partial
or
limited
success
must
first
cross
what
this
court
termed
the
generous
eligibility
threshold
to
become
a
prevailing
party.
and
it
is
appropriate
for
that
threshold
to
be
generous
because
it
is
only
the
first
stage.
the
determination
of
what
amount
is
reasonable
is
made
by
the
district
court,
taking
into
account
relevant
factors
including
particularly
the
level
of
success
achieved.
there
are
several
examples
in
hensley
itself
which
illustrate
the
application
of
that
analytical
approach.
take
hensley.
hensley
was
a
broad-based
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
treatment
and
conditions
at
a
state
mental
hospital
involving
six
general
areas.
the
court
indicated
hypothetically
that
even
if
the
plaintiffs
prevailed
in
regard
to
only
one
of
those
areas,
visitation,
mail
and
telephone
policies,
which
hardly
would
seem
to
constitute
the
central
issue
in
the
case,
that
those
plaintiffs
would
have
been
prevailing
parties
eligible
for
a
fee
award,
although
the
court
did
say
that
the
amount
would
be
reduced
at
the
second
stage
to
reflect
the
work
done
on
unsuccessful
claims.
hensley's
discussion
of
the
eighth
circuit's
decision
in
brown
v.
bathke
is
equally
explicit.
there
you
had
a
discharged
school
teacher,
sought
reinstatement,
lost
wages,
damages,
and
expungement
from
her
record
of
the
negative
material.
she
achieved
only
lost
wages
and
expungement,
lost
on
the
reinstatement,
lost
on
the
damages.
but
this
court
said
that
that
plaintiff
was
the
prevailing
party
eligible
for
a
fee
even
though...
and
i
quote
from
the
court's
opinion
in
hensley...
"she
had
lost
on
the
major
issue
of
reinstatement
and
obtained
only
a
minor
part
of
the
relief
she
sought.
"
and
these
examples
come
as
no
surprise.
they
are
the
natural
outgrowth
of
what
hensley
establishes
for
assuring
that
civil
rights
plaintiffs
receive
reasonable
fees
in
light
of
the
results
obtained.
and
as
this
case
illustrates,
the
central
issue
standard
simply
does
not
fit
within
that
framework.
if
we
are
to
obtain
reasonable
fees
for
the
significant
results
we
obtained,
having
the
gisd
regulation
declared
unconstitutional
as
to
teachers,
we
must
in
the
first
instance
be
allowed
to
cross
over
that
eligibility
threshold.
that
would
allow
the
district
court
to
have
an
opportunity
to
do,
as
the
justice
suggests,
to
calculate
under
hensley
the
amount
of
fees
that
are
reasonable
in
light
of
what
we
achieved.
the
use
of
the
central
issue
test
has
foreclosed
that.
it
has
foreclosed
the
discretion
of
the
district
court,
and
it
has
denied
us
the
opportunity
to
recover
any
fees
even
though
we
have
vindicated
the
policies
of
congress
by
achieving
substantial
secondary
success.
the
respondents,
we
would
submit
to
you,
entirely
missed
the
point
of
hensley.
instead
of
looking
at
the
reasoning
and
the
analysis,
which
clearly
preclude
the
central
issue
test,
they
focus
instead
on
the
opening
paragraph
where
the
court
refers
to
significant
issue
standard
as
"typical
and
generous".
but
admittedly,
it
does
not
say
in
so
many
words
this
is
the
only
standard
that
can
be
used.
limiting
themselves
to
that
one
isolated
paragraph,
respondents
suggest
that
even
if
the
court
accepts
the
significant
issue
standard,
that
does
not
preclude
the
use
of
others.
the
fifth
circuit
would
be
free,
while
some
use
significant
issue,
to
continue
to
use
central
issue.
but
this
argument
is
wrong
even
on
its
own
terms.
the
definition
of
prevailing
party
is
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation.
there
can
be
only
one
standard.
the
question
is
what
did
congress
intend.
and
it
is
not
to
be
left
to
the
discretion
of
each
court
of
appeals
to
answer
that
question.
if
the
significant
issue
standard
accurately
reflects
the
intent
of
congress,
which
we
submit
is
the
teaching
of
hensley,
it
cannot
be
that
the
fifth
or
the
tenth
or
the
ninth
or
any
other
circuit
is
free
to
adopt
a
markedly
narrower,
less
generous
standard.
let
me
pick
up
one
other
point,
another
teaching
of
hensley
and
of
other
cases,
and
that
is
that
fee
applications
should
not
result
in
a
second
major
litigation.
ideally,
once
the
merits
are
determined,
the
parties
should
settle
without
further
burden
on
judicial
resources.
i
submit
to
you
that
the
central
issue
test
cuts
against
both
points.
it
encourages
further
litigation
and
it
deters
settlements.
the
basic
reason
for
this
is
the
inherent
difficulty
involved
in
many
cases
in
determining
what
is
the
central
issue.
by
its
very
nature
that
is
a
complex
inquiry
that
requires
the
court
to
determine
post
hoc
the
goals
and
the
motives
of
plaintiffs
in
initially
bringing
a
lawsuit,
to
arrange
in
some
type
of
hierarchical
order
the
relative
importance
of
the
issues
which
the
plaintiff
has
brought.
this
case
proves
the
point.
this
is
a
relatively
straightforward
and
simple
case,
but
the
fee
application
spawned
further
litigation.
petitioners
contended
in
district
court
that
we
did
prevail
on
the
central
issue.
we
said
the
central
issue
was
can
this
school
district
preclude
all
communication,
we
lost.
we
briefed
it.
we
argued
it.
when
the
district
court
ruled
against
us,
we
appealed
to
the
fifth
circuit.
so,
it
spawned
further
litigation.
consider
how
much
more
difficult
the
problem
would
be
of
identifying
the
central
issue
in
complex
institutional
civil
rights
cases.
take
hensley,
for
example,
which
involves
six
related
issues
involving
treatment
and
conditions
at
a
state
mental
hospital.
what
was
the
central
issue?
and
how
much
judicial
time
and
resources
would
have
been
necessary
to
make
that
determination?
suppose
four
of
the
issues
in
hensley
were
of
equal
centrality.
what's
the
formula?
do
we
have
to
win
on
two
plus
to
meet
the
central
issue
test?
there
is
no
need
to
belabor
the
point.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
but
that,
your
honor,
gets
us--
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
--not
really.
it
gets
us
to
the
second
point.
first
of
all,
that
is
a
much
more
objective
analysis
where
you
look
at
records.
you
look
at
outcome.
you
look
at
issues
in
the
objective
sense
rather
than
the
motives
and
the...
the
thoughts
of
the
plaintiff.
but
let
me
tell
you
why
it
isn't
the
same
because
the
second
objective
that
this
court
hoped
for
was
that
these
cases
would
settle.
and
the
central
issue
case
ceters
settlement.
there
is
virtually
no
incentive
for
me
as
a
defendant
to
settle
under
the
central
issue
test.
i
try
it.
i
go
for
broke.
if
i
win,
i'm
off
the
hook
completely.
and
if
i
lose
on
the
central
issue
test,
the
work
hasn't
been
in
vain.
i'll
throw
it
in
at
the
second
stage,
or
i'll
use
it
as
the
basis
for
a
favorable
settlement.
i
tell
you
about
this
case.
if
we
were
not...
if
we
were,
in
fact,
declared
to
be
the
prevailing
party,
we
would
not
burden
the
district
court
with
stage
two.
i
have
every
confidence
that
this
case
would
have
settled,
which
is
exactly
what
this
court
has
hoped
would
be
the
case
with
fee
applications.
i
would
like
to
reserve
any
remaining
time.
