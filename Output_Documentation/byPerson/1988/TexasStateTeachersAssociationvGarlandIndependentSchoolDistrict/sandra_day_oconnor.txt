justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr.
chanin,
i
wanted
to
ask
about
this
point.
as
you
say,
you
prevailed
on
one
issue
in
the
district
court
concerning
the
use
of
school
premises
during
non-school
hours.
now,
the
district
court
termed
that
issue
minor
since
it
said
there
was
no
evidence
that
union
representatives
were
ever
denied
access
to
teachers
during
non-school
hours.
now,
if
we
were
to
agree
with
you
on
the
appropriate
test,
that
any
significant
issue
test
that
you
propose,
do
you
think
that
that
degree
of
success
would
entitle
you
to
fees
under
that
test?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--so,
you
agree
that
the
defendant
could
be
the
prevailing
party
and
get
fees
under
the
standard
you
propose.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
luna,
do
you
defend
the
central
issue
test
used
by
the
court
of
appeals
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
that's
consistent
with
the
language
that
this
court
included
in
the
hensley
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
it's
consistent
with
the
holdings
of
the
majority
of
other
courts
of
appeal?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
luna,
i
guess
you
would
apply
the
same
test
then
to
the
defendant,
and
if
there
were
several
frivolous
claims
made
on
which
the
defendant
prevailed,
no
recovery
of
attorney's
fees
unless
there
was
a
central
issue
on
which
they
prevailed
as
a
frivolous
claim.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
added
some
frivolous
claims.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no
recovery
to
the
defendant
for
those.
