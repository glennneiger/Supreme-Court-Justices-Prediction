mr.
chanin,
is...
is
that
before
us
here?
i...
i
didn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--understand
that...
that
we
took
this
case
in
order
to
decide
whether
you
had
substantially
prevailed
or
not.
the
question
you
presented
in
your
petition
for
cert
is...
is
simply
whether
a
plaintiff
who
obtains
judgment
in
his
favor
on
a
significant
claim...
whether
he
is
precluded
from
recovering
attorney's
fees
if
the
court
determines
that
the
claim
on
which
he
prevailed
was
not
the
central
issue--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
the
factual
question
of
whether
this
was
a
central
issue
or
wasn't
a
central
issue--
justice
antonin
scalia
--whether
it
was
significant
or
wasn't
significant.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
before
us,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
we're
not
going
to
debate
whether
it
was
or
wasn't.
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
just
question
of
law.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
good.
justice
antonin
scalia
may
i
ask
you
this
about
the
statute
under
which
you're...
you're
seeking
fees?
the
way
it
reads,
it
says
that...
that
a
court
may
allow
the
prevailing
party
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
as
part
of
the
costs.
the
prevailing
party.
on
its
face,
it
seems
to
say
either
the
plaintiff
or
the
defendant.
you
have
to
pick
who
is
the
prevailing
party.
now,
under
your
theory
you
can
have
two
prevailing
parties.
one
party
wins
some
significant
issue,
another
party
wins
another
significant
issue.
how
can
we
possibly
interpret
the
statutory
language
that
way?
now--
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you...
you
would
say
that...
that
we
would
apply
christiansburg
issue
by
issue,
that
if...
if
you
brought...
if
you
brought
up
one
frivolous
issue,
that
fees...
fees
could
be
awarded
to
the
defendant
on
that
frivolous
issue
even
though
you
might
get
fees
an
some
other
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
a
kind
of
extension
you're...
you're
arguing
for
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
what's
sauce
for
the
goose
is
sauce
for
the
gander.
you
want
to
us
split
up
issue
by
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
chanin,
may
i...
may
i
suggest
that
it...
it
doesn't
strike
me
as
utterly
absurd...
the
hypothetical
you
gave
us...
that
had
you
brought
this
one
claim
alone,
you
would
have
gotten
all
your
fees,
but
when
you
bring
it
with
another
one,
you...
you
don't
get
fees.
it
may
well
be
that
had
you
brought
this
claim
alone,
the
school
district
here
would
have
said,
oh,
heck,
that's
no
problem
for
us.
we'll
settle
this
one.
this
isn't
worth
going
to
litigation
on.
but
by
combining
it
with
another
one,
you...
you
compelled
the
school
district
to
go
to...
to
litigation
anyway.
so,
they
said,
well,
while
we're
at
it,
let's
litigate
the
whole
thing.
it
seems
to
me
quite
reasonable
to
say
that
in...
in
one
of
the
situations,
had
you
prevailed,
you
get
all
your
fees.
in
this
one,
you
don't.
i
don't
see
why
it's
absurd--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
you're...
you're
inviting
the
same
kind
of...
i
mean,
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
if...
if
you
don't
like
that
issue-by-issue
inquiry
to
be
conducted,
then
you
have
to
tell
us.
moreover,
the
fees
that
you
get
on
the
issue
you
win
on
should
not
be
reduced
by
the
issues
you
lost
on.
you
said
earlier,
well,
you
can
take
those
other
issues
into
account
by...
by
chopping
your
fees
down
some.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so,
that
same
problem
arises
under
your
theory
as
well.
