mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
following
issue:
must
age-based
distinctions
in
benefits
offered
through
a
bona
fide
employee
benefit
plan
be
justified
by
age-related
cost
considerations?
the
sixth
circuit
answered
that
question
in
the
affirmative.
the
public
employees
retirement
system
of
ohio,
however,
disputes
that
holding
and
believes
that
an
age-related
cost
justification
is
inconsistent
with
the
plain
language
of
the
age
discrimination
and
employment
act
and,
moreover,
is
inconsistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
adea,
and
in
particular,
section
4(f)(2)
of
the
act.
the
facts
are
as
follows.
the
public
employees
retirement
system
of
ohio,
which
i
will
refer
to
as
pers,
was
created
by
the
ohio
general
assembly
in
1933.
it
provides
retirement
benefits
to
ohio
public
employee;
on
the
municipal,
county
and
state
level.
there
are
two
types
of
retirement
benefits
available:
age
and
service
retirements
benefits
and
disability
retirement
benefits.
there
are
three
ways
to
qualify
for
age
and
service
retirement
benefits.
a
member
of
pers
may
be...
must
have
at
least
five
years
of
service
credit,
have
attained
the
age
of
60;
or
must
have
at
least
25
years
of
service
credit
and
be
at
least
55
years
of
age;
or
must
have
30
years
of
service
credit,
irrespective
of
age.
in
order
to
qualify
for
disability
retirement
benefits,
a
member
of
pers
must
have
at
least
five
years
of
service
credit,
have
not
attained
the
age
of
60,
and
be,
or
presume
to
be,
permanently
disabled.
june
betts...
i'm
sorry.
the
actuarial
assumptions
that
underlie
both
the
disability
retirement
benefits
and
the
age
and
service
retirement
benefits
are
intertwined.
and
all
benefits,
whether
they
be
age
and
service
or
disability
retirement
benefits,
are
derived
from
a
common
fund.
june
betts,
the
appellee,
was
hired
by
the
hamilton
county
board
of
mental
retardation
and
developmental
disabilities
at
the
age
of
55.
at
the
age
of
61
she
became
disabled
because
of
health.
she
submitted
applications
both
for
disability
retirement
benefits
and
age
and
service
retirement
benefits
to
pers.
she
requested
that
her
age
and
service
retirement
application
not
be
processed
unless
her
disability
retirement
application
could
not
be
processed.
june
betts
was
more
interested
in
the
disability
retirement
benefits
because
they
would
have
afforded
her
a
higher
monthly
pension.
because
ohio
law
contains
an
age
6o
cutoff
for
eligibility
to
apply
for
disability
retirement
benefits,
pers
could
not
process
her
disability
retirement
application.
they
did,
however,
process
and
approve
her
age
and
service
application.
she
is
currently
receiving
a
monthly
pension,
as
well
as
full
health
care.
june
betts
initiated
suit
claiming
that
the
age
60
cutoff
under
ohio
law
for
eligibility
to
apply
for
disability
retirement
benefits
constituted
a
violation
of
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act.
pers
defended
on
the
basis
that
its
plan
was
protected
under
section
4(f)(2)
of
the
act,
which
provides
that
it
will
not
be
illegal
for
an
employer
to
observe
the
terms
of
any
bona
fide
employee
benefit
plan,
such
as
a
retirement,
pension
or
insurance
plan,
which
is
not
a
subterfuge
to
evade
the
purposes
of
the
act,
provided
no
such
plan
permits
or
requires
involuntary
retirement
because
of
age.
the
district
court
granted
june
betts'
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
two
bases.
first,
the
court
held
that
pers
was
not
the
type
of
plan
contemplated
under
4(f)(2)
because
the
age
60
cutoff
could
not
be
justified
by
age-related
cost
considerations.
secondly,
the
district
court
found
that
the
unavailability
of
disability
retirement
benefits
to
june
betts
was
the
equivalent
of
constructive
discharge
and
involuntary
retirement
because
of
age.
a
divided
panel
of
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed
on
the
basis
that
the
age
60
cutoff
under
pers
could
not
be
justified
by
an
age-related
cost
consideration.
it
did
not,
however,
reach
the
constructive
discharge
or
the
involuntary
retirement
question.
now,
pers
asserts
that
the
sixth
circuit
was
incorrect
in
its
holding
that
4(f)(2)
requires
a
showing
of
age-related
cost
for
three
reasons.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
mr.
chief
justice,
we
are
relying
on
the
language
that
says
quite
clearly,
any
bona
fide
employee
benefit
plan,
such
as
a
retirement,
pension
or
insurance
plan,
which
is
not
a
subterfuge
to
evade
the
purposes
of
the
act.
the
language
clearly
does
not
contain
an
age-related
cost
justification.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
in
respect
to
involuntary
retirement,
your
honor,
or
the
subterfuge
language?
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
your
honor,
the
sixth
circuit
did
not
reach
the
question
of
involuntary
retirement.
however,
the...
the...
the...
the...
the
concept,
the
notion
that
because
june
betts
was
ineligible
to
apply
for
a
particular
benefit,
that
she
was
involuntarily
retired
because
of
her
age
is
just
not
applicable
here.
it
was
her
health
that
required
june
betts,
that
in
fact
motivated
june
betts,
to
apply
to
retire.
she
wanted
to
retire.
the
only
question
is
what
kind
of
retirement
benefit
was
she
going
to
receive.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
which
is
not
a
subterfuge
to
evade
the
purposes
of
the
act.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
yes,
your
honor.
the
sixth
circuit
did
not
address
the
other
question.
the
other
two
reasons
besides
the
fact
that--
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
--yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
in
1976
the
ohio
general
assembly
instituted
a
minimum
benefit
under
disability
retirement
benefits,
a
30
percent
minimum.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
well,
not
a
30
percent
increase.
what
the
ohio
general
assembly
did
was
they
instituted
a
provision
so
that
the
disability
retirant
would
receive
no
less
than
30
percent
of
his
or
her
final
average
salary.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
it
was
post-act
action,
however,
your
honor,
it
distinguished
between
disability
and
age...
between
disability
retirants
and
age
and
service
retirants.
it
did
not
distinguish
specifically
on
the
basis
of
age.
the
ohio
general
assembly
made
a
decision
to
increase
the
benefits
that
would
be
available,
a
minimum
benefit,
to
disability
retirants.
but
it
wasn't
on
the
basis
of
age.
it
affects
all
disability
retirants
and
all
age
and
service
retirants
the
same,
irrespective
of
age.
so
it
is
pers'
contention
that
that
particular
amendment
to
ohio
law
did
not
remove
it
from
the
preexisting
plan
status.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
your
honor,
the...
the
only
sort
of
impact
that
the
provision
would
have
in
respect
to
age
is
that
it
could
have
had
a
residual
impact,
because
as
you
have
noted,
prior
to
1976
the
benefit
was
calculated
the
same.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
but
the
provision
itself
is
neutral
on
its
face
and,
was
intended
to
enhance
the
benefits
of
disability
retirants.
now,
if
the
court
is
approaching
this
from
the...
the
position
that
there
was
some
sort
of
disparate
impact;
if
we
assume
that
under
the
adea
that
there
is
a
disparate
impact
cause
of
action,
and
i
am
aware
that
there
is
some
dispute
in
that
respect,
the
point
would
still
be
that
june
betts
would
have
been
obligated
to
introduce
evidence,
statistical
data,
to
demonstrate
that
there
was
a
disparate
impact
on
older
workers
because
of
this
30
percent
minimum.
in
any
event,
the
provision
is
age-neutral,
and
so
it
did
not
discriminate
against
older
workers.
and
therefore,
whether
pers
is
a
pre-act
plan...
plan--
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
--your
honor,
the...
that
particular
provision
was,
and
therefore--
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
--that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
but,
we
are
not
suggesting
that
the
whole
plan
is
age-neutral.
first,
pers
would
assert
that
it
is
a
pre-existing
plan;
that
all
the
provisions
that
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
age,
i.e.,
the
age
60
cutoff,
was
in
the
plan
well
before
the
adea
was
passed,
let
alone
made
applicable
to
the
states--
moreover,--
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
your
honor,
pers's
assertion
is
that
under
4(f)(2),
one
must
look
to
see
whether
the
plan
as
a
whole
serves
as
a
subterfuge
to
evade
the
purposes
of
the
act.
the
question
here
is
does
the
pers
plan
as
a
whole
serve
to
frustrate
the
employment
of
older
workers
of
discriminate
against
them
in
respect
to
wages
or
other
terms
of
compensation
or
incidentals
that
aren't
associated
with
employee
benefit
plans.
pers
is
suggesting
that
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
plan
is
a
subterfuge
that
one
must
look
at
how
the
plan
as
a
whole
operates.
and
pers'
plan
operates
on
the
whole
as
a
retirement
plan.
it
was
created
to
offer
retirement
benefits
to
various
individuals,
to
applicants,
that
could
no
longer
work
or
chose
to
no
longer
work
for
the
state
of
ohio
might
have
a
retirement
benefit
available
to
them.
but
the
plan
was
not
established,
it
was
not
created
for
the
purpose
of
arriving
older
workers
from
the
work
force
or
interfering
with
their
hiring.
the
very
fact
that
june
betts
was
hired
at
the
age
of
55
and
would
have
been
permitted,
would
have
been
entitled
to
remain
at
her
job,
irrespective
of
her
age,
except
for
her
health,
indicates
that
the
plan
did
not
have
the
effect
of
driving
this
person
from
the
job
market.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
yes,
your
honor,
the
fact
that
the
age
60
cutoff
was
there
made
it
facially
discriminatory.
and
there
has
never
been
an
assertion
by
pers
that
there
isn't
discrimination
in
not,
permitting
people
age
60
or
older
to
apply.
pers'
defense
is
that
under
the
4(f)(2)
exemption
that
sort
of
discrimination
is
permissible;
that
as
long
as
the
terms
of
the
plan
are
observed,
as
long
as
the
purpose
of
the
plan
is
to
provide
an
employee
benefit...
employee
benefits,
as
long
as
the
plan
isn't
designed
to
frustrate
the
employment
of
older
workers
or
to
discriminate
in
respect
to
compensation
that
they
would
receive
outside
of
an
employee
benefit
plan,
that
pers
is
bona
fide.
i
mean
pers
is
a
retirement
system;
there
is
no
other
purpose
behind
it.
it
exists,
i
mean
it
pays
substantial
benefits.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
age-related
cost
consideration
creates
an
obstacle
for
employers--
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
yes.
one
of
the
interesting
things
about
the
age-related
cost
justification
is
the
courts
below
can't
seem
to
agree
what
portion
of
the
exemption
provides
the
statutory
justification.
and...
and
one
might
suggest
that
the
type
of
plan
argument
was
a
development
to
circumvent
this
court's
holding
in
mcmann
v.
united
airlines,
or
united
airlines
v.
mcmann,
because
of
the
subterfuge--
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
--no,
your
honor,
they
don't.
they
don't
point
to
any
language.
the
appellee
and
the
amicus...
the
solicitor
general's
office
would
argue
that...
and
i
use
their
terms,
they
say
both,
the
such
as
language
and
the
subterfuge
language,
can
be
read
to
accommodate
the
age-related
cost
justification.
but,
it's
such
a
clear
statute,
it
just
says
any
bona
fide
employee
benefit
plan
such
as
a
retirement,
pension
or
insurance
plan.
they
had...
congress
had
an
opportunity
to
include
an
age-related
cost
justification;
they
could
have
said
what
they...
what
they
were
trying
to
get
at
in
a
much
more
direct
fashion.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
first,
your
honor,
i
would
point
the
court--
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
--that's
the
argument
posed:
the
question
is:
is
it
reasonable
in
light
of
the
language
of
the
statute?
there
is
nothing
on
the
face
of
this
statute
that
qualifies
the
protection
or
the
coverage
of
the
exemption
to
a
plan
that
can
demonstrate
that
it
has...
that
the
differences
in
benefits
offered
to
older
and...
younger
workers
is
a
result
at
age-related
cost.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
evidence
that
a
court
would
have
to
scrutinize
is
whether
the
plan
as
a
whole
is
intended
to
evade
the
purposes
of
the
act.
so
one
has
to
look
into
the
intent.
one
of
the
problems
with
the
age-related
cost
justification
is
it
takes
a
test
that
requires
an
inquiry
into
the
motivation
of
the
employer,
and
requires
the
employer
to
satisfy
an
objective
rule.
if
you
can't
demonstrate
age-related
cost
justification,
then
ipso
facto,
you
are
a
subterfuge,
no
matter
what
the
intent
of
the
employer.
and
the
age-related
cost
justification
is
not
present
in
the
language.
the
court...
the
language
that
congress--
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
--i
think
what
the
court
would
require
an
employer
to
demonstrate
is
that
his
plan
is
not
conceived
with
the
intention
of
frustrating
the
employment
of
older
workers.
for
instance,
if
the
plan
made
it
difficult
for
an
employer...
an
older
worker
to
be
hired,
or
if
it
made
it
difficult
for
an
older
worker
to
advance
within
the
employ
of
that
particular
company,
specifically
because
of
that
person's
age.
or
if
they
tried
to
use
the
plan
to
reduce
the
wages
or
salaries
of
older
workers.
that
would
mean
it
was
a
subterfuge
to
evade
the
purposes
of
the
act.
i
think
a
good
example
might
be
in
the
karlen
case
out
of
the
seventh
circuit.
now,
that
court
did
find
an
age...
old
rely
on
an
age-related
cost
justification,
but
they
found
that
the
plan
itself
was
bona
fide;
they
just
found
that
the
plan
may
have
been
conceived
with
the
purpose
of
forcing
older
workers
from
the
job
market.
that's
the
sort
of
inquiry
that
the
court
would
engage
in.
and
the
cost
justification,
which
i
think
this
court
at
least
rejected,
in
respect
to...
to
pre-existing
plans
in
the
mcmann
decision,
and
that...
i
think
justice
white's
concurrence
specifically
rejects
the...
if
there
is
no
economic
or
business
purpose
necessary,
and
age-related
cost
is
certainly
a
type
of
economic
or
business
purpose,
it,
too,
would
be
the
improper
test.
and
that's--
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
--your
honor,
congress
did
overrule
part
of
the
mcmann
decision.
it
reversed
this
court
in
respect
to
its
holding
that
involuntary
retirement,
based
on
age,
was
legal
within
the
4(f)(2)
exemption.
but
the
language
passed
by
congress
says
specifically
that
it...
it
addresses
itself
exclusively
to
the
issue
of
involuntary
retirement.
there
is
nothing
in
the
language
of
the
'78
amendment
to
suggest
that
congress
was
addressing
anything
other
than
the
mcmann
position
on
involuntary
retirement.
now,
the
appellee
may
point
to
some
language
in
the
legislative
history,
but,
first,
that
legislative
history
i
think
does
as
much
to
confirm
that
what
congress
was
concerned
about
was
the
issue
of
involuntary
retirement
and
admonishing
the
courts
that,
whether
that
involuntary
retirement
provision
came
in
before
or
after
the
passage
of
the
adea
made
no
difference;
there
was
going
to
be
complete
restriction
in
respect
to
involuntary
retirement
on
the
basis
of
age.
but,
because
the...
the
amendment
in
1978
dealt
only
with
the
issue
of
involuntary
retirement,
any
remarks
in
the
legislative
history
involving
what
that
'67
amendment
meant,
or
what
the
'67
act
meant,
is
irrelevant.
you
can't
look
to
an
older
congress...
or
this
court
has
not
looked
to
a
congress
10
years
later
to
define
the
meaning
of
legislation
passed
in
1967.
moreover,
in
their...
in
the
appellee's
brief
and
the
amicus
brief,
they
now
contend
that
the
1967
act
had
more
than
one
purpose.
in
effect,
they
are
saying
there
were
at
least
two
purposes
underlying
the
4(f)(2)
exemption.
well,
the
remarks
in
the
'78
legislative
history
that
they
refer
to
say...
mention
only
age-related
costs.
it
seems
to
me
inherent
in
that
position
is
that
the
people...
the
congress
in
'78,
even
they
were
misconstruing
the
scope
of
a
4(f)(2)
exemption.
now,
i
think
as
the
court
is
aware,
that
there
are
two
portions
that
the
courts
below
try
to
plug
this
age-related
cost
consideration
in:
the
such
as
language
and
the
subterfuge
language.
now,
i
have
discussed
at
some
length
why
it
shouldn't
fit
in
the
subterfuge
language.
i
would
like
to
address
why
it
can't
fit
into
the
such
as
a
retirement,
pension
or
insurance
plan
language.
the
basic
reason
is
that
age-related
cost
is
not
the
common
thread
that
binds
pension,
retirement
and
insurance
plans.
in
1967
when
the
adea
was
promulgated,
and
even
today,
there
are
plans
such
as
pers'
plans,
such
as
defined
contribution
pension
plans,
or
a
profit
sharing
pension
plan
that
cannot
reflect
age-related
costs.
and
when
congress
passed
this
legislation,
these
were
common
types
of
retirement
plans.
they
could
have
limited
the
scope
of
this
exemption
if
they
wanted
to,
but
they
picked
very
broad
language.
they
said,
any
bona
fide
employee
benefit
plan
such
as
a
retirement,
pension
and
insurance
plan.
but
that
was
to
emphasize
the
point
that
employers
could
not
discriminate
in
respect
to
salary
or
wages
or
incidentals
associated
to
coming
to
work
and
putting
in
a
day's
work
for
a
day's
pay.
so,
the
common
thread
between
retirement,
pension
and
insurance
plans,
however,
is
the
fact
that,
they
do
provide
compensation
of
a
kind
outside
of
wages
and
salary.
moreover,
common
sorts
of
aspects,
or
benefits
within
a
particular
plan...
for
instance,
in
a
defined
benefit
plan,
there
is
no
age-related
cost
justification
for
a
set
off
for
social
security;
there
is
no
increase
for
an
employer
to
provide
benefits
just
because
the
social
security
is
also
providing
benefits.
but
that
sort
of
provision
would
be
illegal
because
it
can't
be
justified
by
an
age-related
cost
consideration.
now,
i
think
i
have
touched
at
length
the
fact
that
the
language
doesn't
support
the
legislative
history.
i...
i'd
like
to
point
out
that...
and
reinforce
that
at
the
time
that
congress
passed
this
legislation,
and
even
today,
there
is
a
fairly
common
understanding
of
what
an
employee
benefit
plan
is.
in
fact,
it's
remarkable
how
legislation
throughout
the
years
has
reflected
a
similarity
in
what
industry,
what
congress
recognizes
as
an
employee
benefit
plan.
and
so
these
sorts
of
plans,
just
like
pers,
was
no
stranger
to
congress
at
the
time
they
passed
the
legislation.
and
i'd
also
like
to
point
out
that,
in
justice
white's
concurrence
in
united
airlines
v.
mcmann,
justice
white
enunciated
the
very
same
policy
that
we
are
enunciating
here.
i
think
it's
also
consistent--
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
--it
got
one
vote,
but
i
thought
it
was
a
very
good
vote.
[laughter]
i
think
also
that
the
mcmann
majority
inherently
reflected
that
position
when
they
said
explicitly
that
a
pre-existing
plan
didn't
have
to
show
an
age-related
cost
justification
because
it
didn't
have
to
show
a
business
or
economic
purpose.
and
the
court
concludes,
and
whether
one
wants
to
consider
it
dicta
or
not,
a
majority
of
this
bench
still
concluded
that
opinion
by
saying
without
qualification
that
an
economic
or
business
purpose
is
not
necessary
to
demonstrate
that
the
employer
falls
within
the
perimeters
of
the
section
4(f)(2)
exemption.
now,
much
of
the
appellee's
case
rests
on
this
court
taking
legislative
history
and
trying
to
cram
it
in
someplace
to
the
4(f)(2)
exemption.
and
they...
they
contend
that
it's
very
clear
in
the
1967
legislative
history
that
all
congress
was
talking
about
was
age-related
costs.
well,
one
of
the
most
principal
pieces
of
legislative
history
in
regard
to
the
adea
is
the
secretary
of
labor's
report,
that
this
court
noted
in
eeoc
v.
wyoming,
provided
a
great
deal
of
guidance
to
congress.
and
the
secretary
of
labor
provided
more
than
just
cost
justification.
in
fact,
the
secretary
of
labor
noted
that
that
wasn't
the
principal
hindrance.
what
the
legislative
history
demonstrates
is
that
4(f)(2)
was
a
vital
compromise.
it
represented
a
vital
piece
of
the
package
in
order
to
get
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act
passed.
congress
wanted
to
insure
that
older
workers
would
be
hired.
they
wanted
to
promote
that.
that
was
the
consuming
purpose
of
the
adea.
and
the
consuming
purpose
of
the
4(f)(2)
exemption
was
to
protect
employee
benefit
plans,
which
might
serve
as
hindrances
to
the
hiring
of
older
workers,
was
to
protect
them
from
disruption.
and
the
age
discrimination...
the
age-related
cost
justification
certainly
does
disrupt
bona
fide
plans.
i
would
direct
the
court
towards
the
amicus
brief
submitted
by
the
state
of
pennsylvania,
pages
29
and
30,
in
which
pennsylvania
notes
that
at
least
10
other
states
denied
disability
retirement
benefits
to
people
who
are
eligible
for
age
and
service
retirement.
and
they
make
reference
to
25
other
states
that
have
plans
that
have
some
sort
of
distinction
based
on
age
in
respect
to
disability
retirement
benefits.
i
would
also
direct
the
court
to
the
amicus
brief
submitted
by
the
association
of
private
pension
and
welfare
plans,
and
direct
the
court
to
page
24,
where
they
indicate
that
the
majority
of
retirement
plans,
just
like
the
plan
at
issue
here,
apparently
limit
eligibility
for
disability
benefits
to
those
younger
employees
who
are
ineligible
for
regular
early
retirement
benefits.
so,
if
congress
was
trying
to
avoid
the
disruption
of
these
employee
benefit
plans
in
order
to
insure
that
employers
would
hire
older
workers,
then
the
age-related
cost
considerations
does
an
injustice
to
that.
the
last
point
that
i
would
like
to
make,
moving
on
from
the
legislative
history,
is
that
the
amicus,
the
eeoc,
in
the
person
of
the
solicitor
general's
office,
will
argue
to
this
court
that
they
should
adopt
the
age-related
cost
considerations...
consideration
because
it's
reflective
of
consistent
agency
policy.
well,
i...
and
agency
interpretation.
i
would
just
like
to
make
note
for
the
court
that
when
this
legislation
was
first...
when
the
eeoc
or
the
department
of
labor
regulations
were
first
published
in
1969,
they
initially
had
one
safe
harbor.
then
later
in
'69,
they
created
two
safe
harbors.
when
the
eeoc
republished
and
revamped
the
regulations
involving
section
4(f)(2),
they
went
back
to
one
purpose
and
one
way
to
satisfy
the
exemption.
and
now,
again,
in
this
appeal,
for
the
first
time
in
this
litigation,
they
argue
that
there
were
really
two
purposes.
well,
i
don't
see
that
sort
of
flip-flop
as
being
consistent
agency
interpretation.
if
anything,
it
indicates
that
the
agency
has
been
inconsistent.
and
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
two
points
right
off
the
bat
that
i
would
i
like
to
address.
first,
justice
stevens,
pers
is
asserting
trial
irrespective
of
whether
it
is
a
pre-existing
plan,
that
is
still
satisfies
the
terms
of
the
exemption.
and
the
reason
is,
is
that
it
is
a
bona
fide
employee
benefit
plan
that
is
not
designed
to
evade...
is
not
designed
to
be
a
subterfuge
to
evade
the
purposes
of
the
act.
the
act
was,
first
and
foremost,
a
mechanism
for
insuring
the
employment
of
older
workers.
and
certainly,
the
public
employees
retirement
system
of
ohio
does
not
in
any
way
interfere
with
the
employment--
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
--it
insures
them--
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
--no,
your
honor.
and
certainly
pers
does
not
do
that.
it
doesn't
affect
in
any
way
the
salary,
the
employment,
the
every-day
sorts
of
things
than
come
with
working.
all
it
says...
all
it
does
is
it
makes
a
distinction
based
on
age
in
respect
to
employee
benefit
plans.
and
pers
freely
admits
that
if
it
wasn't
for
the
4(f)(2)
exemption,
there
would
be
a
problem
for
pers
in
terms
of
satisfying
the
terms
of
the
adea.
but
4(f)(2)
is
an
exception.
it
was
intended
to
permit
discrimination
in
the
area
of
employee
benefit
plans.
now,
one
of
the
big
points
that
has
been
made
here
is
that
pers
didn't
put
on
evidence.
well,
as
this
court
might
recognize,
pers...
ohio
is
one
of
those
states
that
doesn't
have
legislative
history.
so
we
can't
go
back
and
figure
out
exactly
what
the
general
assembly
was
thinking
in
1933,
even
if
we
could
find
anybody
who
was
around
who
was
in
the
assembly
at
that
time.
so,
we
would
urge
the
court,
that
for
a
public
plan,
it
should
go
through
the
same
kind
of
inquiry
it
would
in
analyzing
the
validity
of
any
statute.
it
should
look
and
see
what
sort
of
rational
basis,
what
sort
of
legitimate
basis
that
ohio
had.
and
it's
not
shrouded
in
mystery.
ohio
created
a
retirement
plan,
and
they
started
off
by
figuring
out
that
people
were
going
to
have
to
work
a
certain
number
of
years
and
be
a
certain
age
before
they
can
retire.
and
then,
as
the
district
court
discovered
and
states
clearly
in
its
opinion,
then
what
ohio
did
was
it
provided
a
benefit
for
an
employee,
a
disabled
employee
who
wasn't
old
enough
to
satisfy
age
and
service,
they
gave
him
a
benefit.
now,
i
don't
know
why
that's
arbitrary
age
discrimination.
it
wasn't
intended
to...
to
affect
the
employment
of
older
workers.
it
wasn't
intended
to
affect
their
salaries.
it
just
does
what
4(t)(2)
says.
and
i
will
tell
you
that,
in
ohio,
this
piece
of
legislation
would
be
considered
a
model
of
clarity.
we
disagree
with
mr.
laufman,
that
this
is
a
poorly
designed
statute;
we
think
it
says
what
it
says.
and
he's
right,
we--
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
--if...
if,
for
instance,
in
the
karlen
case,
we
had
a
plan
there
that
certainly
was
designed
to
provide
retirement
benefits,
but
the
circuit
court
unearthed
the
possibility
that
it
was
designed
to
force
older
workers
to
leave
their
jobs.
that
would
be
a
subterfuge.
or
if
they
reduced
salaries,
or
they
used
it
as
a
mechanism
to
reduce
salaries.
but,
i
think
one
has
to
look
at
what
was
it
designed
to
evade;
it
was
designed
to
evade
the
restrictions
on
employment
and
on
compensation
other
than
compensation
offered
through
an
employee
benefit
plan.
and
that's
what
pers
does,
it's
an...
it's
a
retirement
plan.
and
we
are
waiting
for
congress
to
do
what
it's
done
in
the
past,
to
express
its
will
in
legislation.
they
came
in
in
'74
and
they
passed
erisa
to
deal
with
the
pension
battle,
as
jacob
javits...
i
see
my
time
is
up.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
