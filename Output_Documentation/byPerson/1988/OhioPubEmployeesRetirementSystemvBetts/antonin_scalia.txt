justice
scalia
but...
but
we
would
have
to
deal
with
the
question
in
the
future
as
to
how
much
of
an
amendment
is
too
much?
justice
scalia
do
you
have
some
suggestion
as
to...
as
to
how
we
would
answer
that
in
the
future?
justice
scalia
or
how
the
people
who
run
these
plans
are
going...
are
going
to
figure
out...
figure
it
out
before
they
go
making
any
amendments?
justice
scalia
the
states.
right.
justice
scalia
right.
right,
right,
the
plans.
i
mean,
i
assume,
it...
if
we
were
to
come
out
the
way
you
want
us
to,
it'd
be
a
big
problem
for
anyone
who
is
contemplating
a
change
in
a...
in
a
plan
that...
that
currently
qualifies
for
the...
for
the...
for
the
mcmann
exemption.
justice
scalia
uh-huh.
justice
scalia
mr.
laufman,
what
the...
what
the
appellant
says
to
that,
and
i
think
the
language
seems
to
me
to
support
him,
is...
is
that
those
regulations
were
safe
harbors.
they...
they
were
offering
the...
the
person
who
wanted
to
set
up
plans
a...
one
way
to
be
perfectly
safe
and
to
know
that
that...
that
it...
it
could
not
possibly
be
held
to
be
a
subterfuge.
but,
that...
that
that
didn't
set
forth
a...
a
requirement
in
order...
in
order
to
get
the
exemption.
it
was
just
a
safe
harbor.
justice
scalia
if
you
did
this,
you
could
get
it
for
sure.
but
there
may
be
other
ways
of
getting
it.
justice
scalia
well,
if
that's
so,
then
what--
justice
scalia
why
didn't
they
say
that?
i...
you
have
to
admit
that's
a
very,
very
queer
way
to
say
that,
if
that's
what
they
had
in
mind.
i
mean...
if...
i
mean,
they
could
have
said
to
observe
the
terms
of
bona
fide
seniority
system
or
any
bona
fide
employee
benefit
plan
where
the
discrimination
is
cost-based,
or
something
like
that.
justice
scalia
if...
if
they
meant
to
say
what
you
say
they
meant
to
say,
it's
poorly
drafted.
justice
scalia
that...
that's
true.
i
think
there's
another
problem,
too,
mr.
wright.
the
excepts
don't
make
any
sense,
if...
if...
if
what
they
are
talking
about
is
only
cost-justified.
i
don't
know
how
the
failure
to
hire
somebody,
for...
it
says,
except
that
no
such
employee
benefits
plan
shall
exclude
the
failure
to
hire...
hire
any
individual,
and
then
after
the
amendment,
and
no
such
seniority
system
shall
require
or
permit
the
involuntary
retirement.
i
don't
know
how
either
of
those
two
could
possibly
ever
be
justified
on
cost
benefits.
so
you
wouldn't
have
to
say
except
that.
can
you
think
of
how
either
one
of
those
could...
could
be
justified
on
a
cost
basis?
justice
scalia
but,
why
would
they
even
worry
about
that
if...
if
they
thought
they
were
enacting
a
cost...
cost
justification
thing?
there
is
no
way
cost
justification
could
have...
could
have
validated
either
of
those.
justice
scalia
--tell
us
what...
what
can
make
it
a
subterfuge
then?
what--
