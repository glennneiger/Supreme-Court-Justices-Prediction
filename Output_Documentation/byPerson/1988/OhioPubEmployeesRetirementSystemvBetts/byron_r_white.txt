justice
white
well,
all...
all
retirement
plans
are...
are
discriminatory
on...
on
the
basis
of
age,
aren't
they?
justice
white
well,
didn't...
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
say
this
was
a
subterfuge,
did
they?
justice
white
they...
they...
they
went
on
the
other...
they
went
on
the
cost
differences.
justice
white
what...
what...
what
do
the...
what...
what
do
the
guidelines,
so
called
guidelines
rely
on
in...
in
requiring
this
cost
justification?
do
they
identify
the
language
of
the
act
they're
construing?
justice
white
well,
it
may
be,
but...
but...
but,
isn't
it
an
argument
that
it's
a
subterfuge
if
there
isn't
an
age
cost
justification?
justice
white
isn't...
isn't...
at
least
it's
an
argument,
isn't
it?
justice
white
how
many
votes
did
that
get?
justice
white
suppose
you're
right
on
that,
the
'78
amendment,
does...
then,
that
just
destroys
the
argument
that...
that
because
it's
an
old
plan,
it's
not
a
subterfuge?
justice
white
well,
but,
you'd
still
have
to
show
it's
a
subterfuge.
justice
white
and
then
you'd
do
that
by...
on
the
cost
benefit
basis.
justice
white
so
you
have
to
get
to
that
eventually.
justice
white
is...
is
this
the
language
you
rely
on
in
4(f)(2)
that...
that
there
has
to
be
a
cost
justification,
otherwise
it's
a
subterfuge?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
but
that's
one
of
them.
justice
white
i
don't
know,
all
he
has
to
do
is
convince
a
court
that
it's
just
contrary
to
the
words
of
the
act
to...
to...
to
require
a
cost-benefit.
justice
white
i
mean
a
cost
justification.
justice
white
aren't
they
just
guidelines?
justice
white
and
so,
is
that
equivalent
to
saying,
without
costs,
it's
a
subterfuge
or
no?
justice
white
is
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
meant
to
say?
justice
white
you
don't...
do
you...
what
do
you
do
about
the
language
in
mcmann
that
you
don't
need
a
business
purpose
or
any
economic
justification?
