mr.
robert
f.
laufman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
i'
please
the
court:
when
june
betts
was
disabled
at
age
61,
she
was
denied
disability
benefits
by
pers
solely
because
of
her
age.
and
she
was
then
forced
to
retire...
to
apply
for
regular
retirement
rather
than
disability
retirement.
but
for
the
pers
age
60
rule
in
the
person...
in
the
pers
plan,
june
betts
would
have
received
$355
under
disability
benefits
instead
of
the
$158.50
per
month
that
she
received.
now,
it's
undisputed
that
the
pers
plan
discriminates
on
the
basis
of
age
and
would
be
in
violation
of
the
act
unless
it
is
eligible
for
the
4(f)(2)
exemption
to
the
act.
pers
has
two
arguments.
the
first
of
these
arguments
is
that
all
pre-1967
plans
are
exempt
in
perpetuity.
the
second
of
these
issues
is
that
there
is
no
requirement
that
employee
benefit
plans
that
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
age
must
be
justified
by
cost
considerations.
i
will
focus
primarily
on
the
first
issue,
and
mr.
wright,
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
will
be
focusing
and
addressing
the
second
issue.
turning
to
the
first
issue.
as
has
been
noted,
this
is
not
a
pre-ad
act
plan;
that
in
1976,
there
were
modifications.
the
lower
courts
are
unanimous
in
holding
that
where
there
are
substantial
and
relevant
modifications
to
an
employee
benefit
plan,
that
it
loses
its
status
as
a
pre-act
plan.
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
your
honor,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
address
this
issue
because
it
ruled
that
congress
had
overturned
mcmann,
and
therefore
it
was
unnecessary
to
reach
that
particular--
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
--this
is...
that
is
correct.
we
have
also
argued
that
the
so
called
mcmann
issue
is
no
longer
viable.
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
it
was
in
the
plan
from
the
start,
but
when
you
take
the
age
6o
and
the
only
putting
in
a
30
percent
floor
for
disability
because
it
denies
employees
who
become
disabled
after
age
60,
it
discriminates
between
employees
who
are
disabled
before
age
60
and
employees
who
are
disabled
after
age
60.
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
with
the
same
amount
of
seniority,
an
employee
who
was
disabled
at
the
age
of
59
would
receive
30
percent.
an
employee
who
was
disable
at
age
25
would
receive
75
percent
for
life.
and
this
is
totally
different
than
many
of
the
plans
that
most
people
are
familiar
with.
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
yes.
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
go
ahead.
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
i
think
i
understand
the
question,
but
basically--
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
--right.
if
you
look
at
it
before
1976--
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
--she
would
have
received
approximately
the
same
income
under
either
plan.
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
that
is
correct.
because
of
the
way
the
regular
retirement
is...
is
calculated,
the
30
percent
floor
only
affects
employees
with
more
than
five
years
and
less
than
15
years,
13
to
17
years,
and
only
those...
in
that
small
group...
only
those
who
become
disabled
after
age
60.
so
we're
dealing
with
a
very,
very
small
group
of
people.
and
the
total
dollar
effect
that
require...
taking
away
this
age
60
requirement
would
have,
would
be
like
dropping
a
pebble
in
a
pond.
it's
our
position
that
the
changes
in
1967
caused
pers
to
lose
any
pre-act
exemption
that
it
might
have
had.
now,
we
don't
agree
that
there
is
any
such
thing
as
a
pre-act
exemption
anymore.
we
believe
that
that's
limited
to
involuntary
retirement
systems,
and
we
believe
that
it's
clearly
no
longer
the
law,
following
1967...
or
1978.
according
to
the--
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
--that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
that
is
correct
also.
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
i
think
it's
going
to--
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
--you're
talking
about
the
amendments
to
the
plans--
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
--not
the
amendment
to
the
statute?
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
that
is
correct.
and
the
lower
courts
are
unanimous
in
holding
that
when
you
make
substantial
and
relevant
changes.
and
i
suggest...
submit
that
the
test
for
substantial
and
relevant
is
going
to
be
the
same
kind
of
a...
a
test
that
the
courts
are
used
to
applying
all
the
time.
if
they
change
some
thing
such
as
allowing
the
police
officers
to
buy
one...
one
year
of
extra
time
or
buy
service
credit,
it
probably
would
not
be
significant
and
relevant.
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
but
when
you
start
changing
things
that
directly
affect...
impact
on
the
age
discrimination
factor,
then
i
submit
that
it
is
a
significant
and
relevant
factor,
and
clearly
is
in
this
case.
the
approach
the
pers
takes,
that
pre-existing
plans
are
exempt,
in
effect,
is
saying
that
congress
granted
them
a
perpetual
exemption...
the
perpetual
right
to
continue
to
violate
the
law
until
somehow
congress
says
we
were
wrong
and
changes
the
law.
what
they've
done
is
created
two
classes.
you
have
a
pre-1967
and
a
post-1967.
the
pre-act
are
free
to
discriminate
at
will--
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
--that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
you'd
still
have
to
show
it's
a
subterfuge,--
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
--you'd
do
that
in
the
cost
benefit
basis.
and
i
think--
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
--and
i
submit
that
that's
there's
a...
there's
a
basis
for
that.
it's
important
to
note,
i
think,
that
this
4(f)(2)
is
an
exception
to
remedial
statute.
and
so,
our
position
that
this
should
be
interpreted
narrowly.
now,
the
burden...
and...
and
first,
in
this
court,
has
said
that
that's
an
affirmative
defense.
and
so
the
burden
is
on
pers
to
show
that
it
qualifies.
now,
it
has
the
burden
of
proving
that
there
is
no
subterfuge.
now,
if
you--
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
--there's
two
different
ways
of
approaching--
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
--the
cost
justification.
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
that's
one
of
them.
the
employers,
having
the
burden
of
proving
something
is
not
a
subterfuge
is
a
very
difficult
task
of
proving
a
negative,
especially
where
you
have
a
state
legislature
in
ohio
which
keeps
no
legislative
history,
so
that
it's
almost
impossible
to
determine
what
the
intent
was
when
they
amended
or
passed
an
act.
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
well,
that
is...
that
is--
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
--that
is
precisely
why
the...
the
eeoc
regulations,
which
provide--
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
--they
are
just
guidelines.
they're...
they're...
they
call
them
interpretations.
we
submit
that
this
court
should
give
it
some
deference
because
they
have
been
consistent
over
the
years.
they've
been
in
effect
20
years,
and,
in
the
whole,
the
employers
in
this
country
have
been
adhering
to
those
regulations.
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
the
regulations
have
changed,
but
they
have
been
totally
consistent.
in
1969
the
regulations
came
out
with
what
amounted
to
an
equal
cost,
equal
benefits
approach.
that
is,
if
the
plan
paid
equal
benefits,
there
was
no
discrimination.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
plan
cost
the
same
amount,
even
thought
it
provided
smaller
benefits,
there
was
no
discrimination.
and
the
example
are
given
in
the
eeoc
regs
is
that
it's
perfectly
all
right
for
an
employer
to
pay
$100
for
life
insurance
for
all
its
employees.
and
if
it
turns
out
that
the
younger
employee
gets
twice
as
much
life
insurance,
while
that
might
have
been
a
violation
of
the
act,
it's
permitted
under
the
4(f)(2)
exemption.
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
that's
true.
and--
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
--that's
true.
but--
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
--but...
but,
at
this
point,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
pers
produced
absolutely
no
evidence
of
any
kind
of
a
justification.
their
entire
approach
was:
we
existed;
therefore,
we
are;
that
because
of
their
existence,
they
don't
have
to
do
anything.
they
have
produced
absolutely
no
evidence
of
any
kind
of
justification.
so
if
there
are
other
types,
no
one
has
come
forward
with
another
type.
the
justice...
the
eeoc
regulations
have
been
in
effect
for
years,
they
have
been
consistent,
and
they
provide
an
objective
way
of
meeting
a
very
complex
problem.
there
are
a
multitude
of
employee
benefit
plans,
and
even
within
retirement
plans
there
are
profit-sharing
plans,
there
are
defined
benefit
plans,
and
there
are
variations.
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
well,
i
don't
think
we
really
get
into
intent.
the
intent
is
to
discriminate
and
that
has
already
been
established.
the
question
then
is
whether
or
not
a
subterfuge,
and
if
they
could
produce
cost-based
justification,
then
they
have
dispelled
the
argument
that
there
is
a
subterfuge.
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
i
believe
this
court
said
that
in
thurston
that
the
section
4(f)(1)
and
4(f)(2)
are
affirmative
defenses,
and
that
the
burden
would
always
be
on
the
defendant.
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
well,
i
think--
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
--in
our
position
and
in
the
regulation
position,
it's
the
employers,
because
they're
the
only
one
that
have
the...
the
evidence
of
cost
considerations.
they're
the
ones
that--
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
--i
said
that
there
is
no
cost
defense
because
they
made
no
effort
to
put
on
any
evidence
to
suggest
a
cost
justification.
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
i'm
sorry?
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
oh.
i
think
what
i
was
referring
to
is
the
impact
on
this
plan...
on
the
pers
plan--
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
--is
that
if
this
court
ruled
that
the
plan
was
in
violation
of
the
act,
there
are
so
few
employees
who
fit
into
this
very
narrow
window
where
it
has
any
effect,
that
the
50
to
100
employees
that
would
be
added
to
a
plan
that
pays
something
like
$400
million
a
year
in
benefits,
would
be
insignificant.
that
was
my...
the
point
i
was
making.
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
the
court
below
essentially
quoted
judge
posner
in
karlen,
who
said
that
where
an
employer
cannot
produce
actuarial
costs
to
justify
age
discrimination
in
employee
benefits,
he'd
better
be
able
to
prove
a
close
correlation
between
age
and
cost
if
he
wants
the
shelter
of
the
safe
harbor
of
section
4(f)(2).
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
that
is...
i
believe
is
the--
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
--is
the
position
that
the
court
has
taken,
yes.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
pers
says
that...
essentially,
that
all
employee
benefit
plans
are
covered.
essentially,
they
are
throwing
out
all
of
the
eeoc
regulations
that
have
been
in
effect
for
20
years.
and,
in
particular,
the
regulation
that
has
been
in
effect
for
1o
years
pertaining
to
disability
plans,
which
pers
clearly
violates.
the
plan...
the
disability
section
of
the
regs
says
that
where
employees
who
are
disabled
at
a
younger
age
are
entitled
to
long-term
disability
benefits,
there
is
no
cost
justification
for
denying
such
benefits
altogether
to
employees
who
are
disabled
at
older
ages.
essentially,
pers
would
read
section
4(f)(2)
out
of
the
statute.
if
all
employee
benefit
plans
are
exempt,
as
they
maintain,
then,
supplemental
unemployment
benefits,
severance
pay,
prepaid
legal
services,
would
all
be
exempt.
none
of
these
has
any
age-based
cost
justification.
now,
this
court
today,
in
davis
v.
michigan,
said
that
the
statutory
language
cannot
be
examined
in
a
vacuum.
words
of
a
statute
must
be
read
in
their
context
with
a
view
to
their
place
in
the
overall
statutory
scheme.
congress
passed
section
4(a)(1),
which
says
that
it
shall
be
unlawful
to
discriminate
in
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
and
then
they
set
up
an
exception,
on
the
other
hand,
which
says
that
it
shall
be
lawful
to
discriminate
in
certain
types
of
employee
benefit
plans.
the
eeoc
regulations
is
a
careful
harmonizing
of
these
two
conflicting
parts
of
the
statute.
it
provides
and
it
recognizes
that
congress,
when
it
passed
the
law
in
1967,
recognized
that
there
were
certain
problems...
that
certain
types
of
employee
benefit
plans
were
more
expensive
for
older
workers
than
for
younger
workers.
and
in
intended
that
employers
would
be
allowed
to
reduce
the
benefits
to
the
extent
that
they
did
not
cost
more.
and
so
this...
this
regulation
balances--
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
--justice
scalla,
i
will
admit
that
this
is
a
poorly
drafted
statute.
i
think
that
we
are...
we
have
a
statute--
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
--it...
if
you
want
what
i
think,
i
think
at
the
time
they
recognized
there
was
a
problem,
and
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
indicates
that
they
considered
how
to
resolve
the
problem.
instead,
they
said
we
expect
the
secretary
of
labor
to
write
comprehensive
regulations.
they
said
that
in
1967.
they
said
it
in
the
statute,
and
they
said
it
in
1979
again.
and
this
is
exactly
what
has
happened.
the
department
of
labor,
and
later,
the
eeoc,
which
have
expertise
in
handling
comprehensive
employee
benefit
plans,
wrote
regulations
which
clearly
provide
a
balancing
between
discriminating
against
the
employee
unnecessarily
and
depriving
or
penalizing
the
employer
who
hires
older
workers.
i
believe
that
this
is
a
harmonizing
of
the
two
statutes;
the
purposes
of
the
act,
along
with
the
purpose
of
the
exemption.
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
i
don't
have
the
answer
to
that.
and
the...
it's
troubled
the
courts...
this
is
not
the
first
time
that
it's--
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
--it's
a
poorly
written
statute;
we
all
agree
on
that.
mr.
robert
f.
laufman
i
believe
that
mcmann
is
limited
to
involuntary
retirement,
because
it's
clear
that
there
was
no
cost-based
justification
in
the
intent
of
congress
when
it
was
talking
about
permitting
involuntary
retirement;
nor
did
the
eeoc
regulations...
or
the
adea...
i'll
try
it
again...
the
department
of
labor
regulations.
none
of
those
had
anything
in
there
about
a
cost
justification
for
involuntary
retirement.
the
regulations
for
employee
benefits,
back
in
1969,
did.
i
believe
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
