mr.
christopher
j.
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind,
as
mr.
laufman
just
pointed
out,
that
not
only
has
ohio
failed
to
produce
a
age-related
cost
justification
for
its
discrimination
here,
it's
produced
no
justification
whatsoever.
both
the
department
of
labor,
which
administered
the
act
until
1979,
and
the
eeoc,
which
has
administered
it
since,
have
agreed
that
section
4(f)(2)
is
not
the
wide-open
authorization
to
discriminate
that
ohio
contends
it
is.
rather,
the
agencies
have
agreed
that
the
statute
requires
employees
to
justify
discrimination,
usually
by
showing
that
it
costs
more
to
provide
benefits
to
older
employees.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
not
in
the
sense
of
the
life
insurance
example.
if,
by
age-related
cost
justification,
you
mean
that
the
term
life
insurance
example
that
was
very
much
on
congress'
mind
in
1967,
no,
we
think
it
extends
beyond
that.
but,
let
me
add
that
it
has
always
been
clear
that
it
extends
beyond
that.
if
i
may
digress
briefly
into
the
legislative
history
to
answer
your
question.
the
1967
legislative
history,
and
let
me
make
clear
that
it
was
in
1967,
not
1978
that
i'm
talking
about,
there
were
clearly
two
problems
on
congress'
mind.
one
was
benefits
such
as
term
life
insurance,
which
do
cost
more
to
provide
older
employees
than
younger
employees.
congress
wanted
to
allow
employers
to
spend
the
same
amount
on
older
employees,
even
though
they
would
be
discriminated
against
in
that
they
would
receive
a
lesser
benefit.
also
on
congress'
mind,
as
is
made
clear
by
the
colloquy
between
senator
javits,
who
drafted
section
4(f)(2),
and
senator
yarborough,
who
was
the
sponsor
of
the
bill,
congress
wanted
to
make
clear
that
vesting
periods
were
permissible.
now,
vesting
periods
do
not
fall
into
the
age-related
cost
justification
except
in,
like,
term
life
insurance.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
we
don't
agree
with
that,
justice
o'connor.
and
while
the
language--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
what--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
let
me...
let
me
point
out
that...
that
the
way
ohio
reads
it
and
the
way
you
just
paraphrased
it,
it
end...
it...
the
statute
would
have
ended
it,
bona
fide
employee
benefit
plans.
it
does,
of
course,
continue
to
say,
such
as
retirement,
pension
or
insurance
plans,
which
are
not
a
subterfuge
to
avoid...
to
evade
the
purposes
of
the
act.
let
me...
let
me
turn
to...
to
the
language
of...
to
that
language.
the
first
part
of
that
language,
the...
such
as
the
retirement
pension
or
insurance
plan,
was
emphasized
by
the
department
of
labor
in
1969
when
it
wrote
the
original
regulations
here.
like
the
court
of
appeals
in
westinghouse,
it
thought
that
the
thread
common
to
the
sorts
of
plans
that
congress
had
listed
is
that
the
cost
of
providing
benefits
often
rises
as...
as
employees
age.
and
it
concluded
that
congress
wanted,
by
that
language,
to
insure
that
discrimination
was
justified
in
that
circumstance.
now,
i
realize
that
they
could
have
said
it
clearer,
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
ohio
reads
that
phrase
out
of
the
statute,
gives
it
no
meaning
whatever.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
think
congress
just
wanted
to
make
absolutely
clear
that
neither
refusals
to
hire,
nor
involuntary
retirements
were
permissible.
and
it
at
least
made
that
clear--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--that's
correct.
but,
remember
that
they
also
thought
that
they
were
allowing
vesting
periods.
and...
and
in
allowing
vesting
periods,
perhaps
the
original
administration
bill
had...
had
allowed
involuntary
retirement.
i
think
the
end
of
the
statute
just
spells
those
things
out,
fortunately,
fortunately
quite
clearly.
on
the
subterfuge
language,
let
me
just...
just
briefly
say
that
discriminatory
treatment
of
older
employees
that
is
not
justified,
is
a
subterfuge
to
evade
the
purposes
of
the
acts
because
a
purpose
of
the
act,
which
ohio
ignores,
is
to
prohibit
arbitrary
discrimination
against
older
employees.
the
act
does
not
only
prohibit
refusals
to
hire.
and
discrimination
that
is
not
justified
is
arbitrary.
i
think
that
it's
clear
that
this
is
a
post-act
statute.
before
1976--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--excuse
me?
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes.
that's
what
i
meant.
before
1976,
it
is
true
that
60
year
olds
could
not
apply
for
disability
retirement
in
ohio,
but
they
weren't
discriminated
against
as
a
result.
they
got
the
same
amount
that
anyone
else
got.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
in
fact,
there's
no--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well?
there
was
also...
there
is
also
the
fact
that
they...
after
age
60
weren't
allowed
to
be
on
a
recall.
i
think...
i
think
that
was
really
the
only
difference
before
1976.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
before
1976,
it
didn't
matter.
after
1976--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--it's
undisputed
that,
in
terms
of
amount
of
benefits,
it
didn't
matter.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that
is
correct.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
there
was
that
discrimination
against
employees
here,
and
mr.
laufman
has
made
that
argument
that...
that,
in
fact,
june
betts
was
involuntarily
retired
as
a
result.
as
the
court
of
appeals
stated,
despite
having
every
opportunity
to
do
so,
ohio
made
no
attempt
at
all
to
justify
its
discriminatory
treatment
of
the
plaintiff
here.
it
has
insisted
all
along
that
section
4(f)(2)
authorizes
any
sort
of
age
discrimination
in
the
provision
of
employee
benefits.
the
only
exception,
ohio
states
at
page
26
of
its
brief,
is
that
a
plan
may
not
be
conceived
to
avoid
the
statute's
purpose
of
facilitating
the
employment
of
older
workers.
that's
no
limit
at
all,
and
it
ignores
the
act's
prescription
of
arbitrary
discrimination
against
older
employees
in
the
terms
of
employment.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
no,
they
do
not
concede
that.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
but,
of
course,
that's
correct;
that
if
it
were
adopted
today,
it
would
be
illegal.
[laughter]
contrary
to
ohio
congress
did
not
intend
to
allow
employers
to
discriminate
at
will
in
the
provision
of
employee
benefits.
as
judge...
as
judge
posner
stated
in
karlen,
congress
did
not
authorize
employers
to
take
away
parking
spaces
or
dental
insurance
or
any
other
employee
benefit
for
no
good
reason.
yet,
it
would
be
permissible,
under
ohio's
approach,
for
an
employer
to
arbitrarily
cut
off
benefits
to
older
employees.
all
we
contend
here
is
that
congress
intended
to
outlaw
such
arbitrary
discrimination.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
