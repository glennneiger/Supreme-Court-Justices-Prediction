chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
88-389,
public
employees
retirement
system
of
ohio
v.
june
betts.
mr.
sutter,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
precise
language
in
4(f)(2)
are
you
relying
on,
mr.
sutter?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
then,
how
about
the
proviso
that
comes
afterwards?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
where
in
says,
and
no
such
employee
benefit
plan
shall
require
or
permit
the
involved,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
does
that
not
have
a
bearing
on
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you
say
all
we
have
before
us
is
whether
or
not
pers
has
a
bona
fide
employee
benefit
plan,
such
as
a
retirement,
pension
or
insurance
plan?
chief
justice
rehnquist
which
is
not
a
subterfuge
to
evade
the
purposes...?
chief
justice
rehnquist
isn't
there
some
indication
that
congress
intended
to
overrule
part
of
our
mcmann
decision?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
sutter.
mr.
laufman.
chief
justice
rehnquist
was
this
point
passed
on
by
the
court
of
appeals,
mr.
laufman?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you're
arguing
this
as
an
alternative
basis
for
affirming?
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
we
agreed
with
your
submission
that,
because
of
the
amendment
this
is
not
a
pre-act
plan,
we
wouldn't
have
to
deal
with
the
question
of
whether
the
'78
amendment
is
limited,
as
your
opponent
suggests,
or
more
broad
as
you
suggest?
chief
justice
rehnquist
have
they
changed?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--under
the
eeoc
regulations,
if
you
can
produce
a
cost
justification,
does
that
take
out
the
question
of
intent?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you
couldn't
go
behind
the
cost
justification
and
say,
well,
really
at
a
conference
committee
in
the
ohio
legislature,
someone
said
let's
pass
this
because
we
don't
like
old
people?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
laufman.
mr.
wright.
chief
justice
rehnquist
a
post-act
plan--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--a
post-act
plan.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wright.
mr.
sutter,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sutter.
the
case
is
submitted.
