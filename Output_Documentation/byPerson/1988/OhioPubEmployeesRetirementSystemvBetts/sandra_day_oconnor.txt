mr.
sutter.
justice
o'connor
may
i
ask
about
the
operation
of
this
plan?
i
take
it
the
benefits
were
the
same
for,
voluntary
retirement
or
for
disability
up
until
1976,
was
it?
justice
o'connor
well,
they
were
the
same
until
then.
and
then...
there...
then,
in
1976
there
was
a
30
percent
increase
in
disability
benefits,
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
well,
this
discrepancy
arose
by
action
in
'76?
justice
o'connor
and
that
was
post-act
action?
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you...
it
seems
to
me
that
it
could
be
viewed
as
an
attempt
to
use
a
pre-act
plan
as
a...
a
subterfuge.
justice
o'connor
right--
justice
o'connor
--well
the...
the...
the
plan,
viewed
as
a
whole,
is
not
age-neutral,
is
it?
justice
o'connor
you
are
just
saying
the...
the
addition
in
1976
was?
justice
o'connor
but
if
you
look...
if
you
look
at
the
whole
plan
as
amended,
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
it
is
age-neutral.
justice
o'connor
well,
you
can't
just
make
any
subsequent
changes
with
impunity,
can
you?
justice
o'connor
do
we
have
to
look
at
the
subsequent
changes
and
their
effect
to
see
if
it's
subterfuge?
justice
o'connor
but
as
you
look
at
it
in
its
effect
now,
as
amended,
it
appears
to
be
facially
discriminatory.
justice
o'connor
well,
what
evidence
other
than
cost
justification
would
ever
be
relevant
in
determining...
or
proving
that
a
facially
discriminatory
plan
is
not
a
subterfuge?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
would
the
employer
intend
or
point
to
other
than
cost
justifications?
justice
o'connor
well,
you
don't
now
take
the
position
that
the
employer's
defense
is
absolutely
limited
to
cost-based
justifications?
justice
o'connor
well,
if
you
just
look
at
the
language
of
4(f)(2),
together
with
the
basic
prohibitions
of
(a)(1)
and
(a)(2)
of
the
section
623,
it
looks
more
logical,
doesn't
it,
to
think
that
congress
just
wanted
to
eliminate
bona
fide
pension
and
benefit
plans
from...
from
the
scope
of
the
prohibitions
of
the
act?
justice
o'connor
it
certainly
reads
that
way--
justice
o'connor
--unless
there
is
a
subterfuge.
