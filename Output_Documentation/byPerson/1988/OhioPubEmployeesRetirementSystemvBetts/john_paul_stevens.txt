justice
stevens
may
i
ask
on
your
point
that
it
was
new
plan
when
they
amended
it?
the
age
60
cutoff
for
disability
benefits
was
in
the
plan
from
the
start,
was
it
not?
justice
stevens
but,
that
discrimination,
although
not
as
dramatic,
was
in
the
plan
before
though?
justice
stevens
and
was
it
also
true
that...
i
mean
the
discrimination
between
pre-60
and
post-60
people?
justice
stevens
was
it
also
true
before
the
change
that
disability
retirees
received
a
larger
benefit
than
a...
a
person
with
the
amount
of
seniority
that
your
client
had?
justice
stevens
well,
wait
a
minute.
justice
stevens
just...
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understand.
justice
stevens
right
before
the
'76
amendment,
if
your
client
had
had
the
same
age
and
the
same
seniority
that
she
did
have
when
she
retired,
if
she
had
done
that
in
1976,
would
she
have...
would
the
same
discrimination
have
been
present?
in
other
words,
would
she
have
made
more
by
getting
the
disability
pension
than
the
retirement
pension?
justice
stevens
well,
the
question
is,
now
she
gets
three
hundred...
she
would
have
gotten
$350;
she
gets
about
160
now.
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
i
see.
the
disability...
the
increase
to
30
percent
of
salary
was
so
great
that...
before...
i
mean
there
would
have
been
no...
no...
basically
no
difference.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
mr.
laufman?
does
everyone
agree...
i
guess
they
must,
that
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
subterfuge
issue
is
on
the
proponent
of
the
plan
rather
than
the
person
who
claims
it's
a
subterfuge?
justice
stevens
well,
i...
it
can
still
be
an
affirmative
defense
to
show
that
it's
a
bona
fide
seniority
system
and
then,
say,
the
president
of
the
company
gets
on
the
stand
and
says
it's
not
a
subterfuge,
we
didn't
adopt
it
for
any...
any
age-related
reason;
we
like
old
people.
would
that...
and
then
the
burden
shifts.
justice
stevens
i
mean,
what
i'm
really
asking,
suppose
is,
assuming
the
cost
is
an
issue,
who
has
to
get
into
proving
costs
are
non-costs?
justice
stevens
well,
but
you
just
a
moment
ago
said
that
it's
only
going
to
cost
them
a
penny
to...
i
mean
that
there's...
you
said
in
this
case,
it's
perfectly
obvious
that
there's
no
cost
defense.
you
said
that
earlier.
justice
stevens
oh,
i
thought
you
indicated
that
that...
that
there
really
wasn't
any
cost
here
because
the
60...
60
age
thing
was
perfectly
obviously
an
arbitrary--
justice
stevens
--i
thought
you...
i
may
have
misunderstood
you.
i
thought
earlier
in
the
argument,
you
had
said
that
it
was
perfectly
obvious
that
it
would
cost
them
a
penny...
or
something
like
that...
to
remove
the...
the
age
60
cutoff.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
i
see.
the
court
below
said
this
wasn't
a
subterfuge,
didn't
they?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
another
question
about
the
language
that
i
find
very
puzzling?
it
talks
about
a
bona
fide
system,
which
is
not
a
subterfuge.
does
that
indicate
that
there
are
some
bona
fide
systems
which
are
subterfuges?
justice
stevens
it's
baffling
to
me...
that.
justice
stevens
if
they
got
they
same
amount,
i
don't
understand
what
the
purpose
or
the
cutoff
was.
it
seems
kind
of
improbable
to
me...
just
a
totally--
justice
stevens
--they
just...
somebody
just
dreamed
it
up,
do
you
think?
justice
stevens
but
if
their
benefits
would
be
the
same
under
the
retirement
plan
or
the
disability
plan,
there
is
no
reason
to
cutoff
the
disability
benefit...
tweedie
dum
and
tweedie
dee.
justice
stevens
but
i'm...
i'm
just
suggest...
it
seems
improbable
that
it
did
not
matter
before
1976,
if
they
had
that
cutoff.
because
it
was
a
totally
purposeless--
justice
stevens
--well,
except...
except
the
e
benefit
of
being
rehired.
justice
stevens
i
think
they
are
saying,
once
you're
over
60,
you
can't
come
back
even
if
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
might...
might
have
provided
that
people
who
are
out
for
illness
automatically
come
back.
why
isn't
that
a
significant
discrimination?
justice
stevens
well,
i
think
they
conceded
if
this
plan
here
adopted
today,
it
would
be
illegal.
don't
they
concede
that?
justice
stevens
oh,
they
don't?
justice
stevens
well,
it
isn't
just
the
employment,
it
also
is
to
insure
them
equal
treatment
when
they...
after
they
get
employed.
isn't
it?
isn't
there--
justice
stevens
--you
can'
t
put
them
all...
all
the
older
people
in
the
closet
and
say
it's
just
because
you're
not
being
hired
now--
