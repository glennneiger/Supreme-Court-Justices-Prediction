crank
the
thing
a
little
higher.
you're
a
tall
scandinavian
there.
we--
justice
antonin
scalia
and
there
was
testimony
in
the
trial
that
said
it
could
still
be
done
on
the
swab.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
made
the
tactical
decision
not
to
test
the
swab.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
had
a
shot
at
doing
the
p-30
sample
on
the
swab.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
didn't
even
take
that
shot.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
one
really
wonders
how...
you
know,
how
sincere
you
are
about
using
this
evidence
as
opposed
to
really
using
it
as
an
argument
to
the
jury,
which
is
how
you
did
use
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
tell
us
that
there
wasn't
much
chance
that
you'd
get
anything
from
the
swab,
but
there
was
some
chance--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
you
didn't
take
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
can't
you
retest?
is
it
clear
that
there
is
not
enough
left
on
the
swab
to
retest?
never
mind
looking
to
see
if
the
original
test
was
valid
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
he
said
that
a
test
could
be
done
on
the
swab.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
didn't
think.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
was
enough
to
satisfy
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
state
didn't
have
a
client
they
were
trying
to
get
off.
they
thought
they
had
enough
evidence
to
convict
your
client.
you
were
looking
for
evidence
to
acquit
him.
but
just
on
that
statement
that
he
didn't
think
there
was
enough,
you
said,
well,
there
must
not
be
enough
and
chose
not
to
go
back
and
do
any
tests
on
the
swab.
i
can't
imagine
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
that.
it
could...
if
there
was
enough
to
do
proper
testing,
it
could
have
shown
that
your
client
was
not
the
culprit,
couldn't
it,
if
there
was
enough
to
do
a
proper
test?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
in
the
amount
that
had
been
tested.
if
there's
enough
left
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
that.
i
thought
you
could
go
back
and
not
just
determine
that
there
are
80
units
left,
but
test
those
80
units
right
then
and
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
p-30.
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
ever
use
the
p-30
test
in
this
instance
if
all
it
tells
you
that
there
is
enough
to
conduct
another
test
that
means
something?
justice
antonin
scalia
xxx
to
the
other
argument,
as
the
jury
saw
it,
not
very
good.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
that's
all
we
can
guess
by,
the
other
evidence
that
we
have.
and
the
jury
found
that
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
the
test,
had
it
been
done,
would
have
shown
that
your
client
was
the
culprit.
justice
antonin
scalia
--how
much
semen
you
have.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
useless
test,
isn't
it?
