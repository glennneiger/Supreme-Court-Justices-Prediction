chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
86-1904,
arizona
v.
youngblood.
mr.
gustafson,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
is
it
gustafson
or...
it's
gustafson,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you've
americanized
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gustafson,
could
you
speak
up
a
little
bit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
test
was
it
that
they
didn't
have
at
the
time?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
but
now
the
acid
test
they
had,
but
didn't
use?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
p-30
test
they
didn't
have.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
when
you
say
they
didn't
have,
what
do
you
mean?
that
the
tucson
police
department...
pima
county
police
department
didn't
employ
that
sort
of
test?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
confused
by
your
answers
to
justice
stevens
and
justice
kennedy
and
justice
white.
and
it
may
well
not
be
your
fault.
at
one
time
you
said
that
the
pima
county
criminologist
said
that
the
p-30
was
not
in
practice
in
pima
county.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
now
i
thought
you
answered
justice
stevens
that
the
state
could
have
performed
a
p-30
test
before
the
second
trial.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
do
you
reconcile
those
two
answers?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
did
the
state
not
do
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
he
rendered
his
opinion
that
it
would
not
have
been
useful
in
producing
evidence.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
unhum.
and
you
say
the
defendant
was
able
to
perform
this
p-30
test
if
he
had
so
desired.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gustafson.
now,
mr.
davis,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
your
complaint,
constitutional
complaint,
that
the
state
failed
to
test
something
at
a
time
when
it
could
have
been
tested,
and
by
the
time
you
found
out
that
that
sort
of
thing
existed
it
was
too
late
to
test
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
other
part
of
your
complaint?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
case
do
you
rely
on
for
the
proposition
you're
now
stating?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
trombetta
certainly
doesn't
support
you
because
it
does
talk
about
good
faith.
what
case
do
you
rely
upon
for
the
proposition
you
just
stated?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
valenzuela-bernal
doesn't
come
close
to
supporting
you.
that
was
where
the
government
deported
a
couple
of
witnesses.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
what
case
is
a
holding
in
your
favor
on
this
point?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
they
aren't...
you
don't
seriously
mean
that
those
are
holdings
in
your
favor
on
this
point,
do
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
of
course,
they're
not.
so,
what
case
is
it
that
you
rely
on?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
that
the
crucial
issue
as
to
whether
they
tested
enough
from
the
swab?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
now,
this
is
not
evidence
that
the
state
used...
introduced
at
trial
to
incriminate
the
defendant.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
broad
is
this
duty?
is
the
constitution
going
to
tell
prosecutors
how
they
ought
to
investigate
cases?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
didn't
perform
the
tests
in
time
to
have
them
relevant.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
say
the
constitution
says
that
conviction
must
be
reversed
even
though
there
is
no
showing
of
bad
faith.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we
have
never
held
the
right
of
the
accused
to
defend
himself
extends
as
far
as
you're
asking
us
to
extend
it,
to
simply
having
the
police
preserve
every
bit
of
evidence
they
ever
come
across
in
the
investigation
that
might
be
relevant.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
surely
you
were
entitled
to
impeach
the
victim
at
the
second
trial
by
showing...
and
the
jury
was
entitled
to
credit
or
not
credit
as
it
chose.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
davis.
mr.
gustafson,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gustafson.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
number
86-1904,
arizona
against
youngblood.
in
this
case,
a
10-year-old
boy
was
molested
and
sodomized
by
a
middle-aged
man
for
one-and-a-half
hours.
after
the
assault,
the
boy
was
taken
to
a
hospital
where
a
physician
used
a
sexual
assault
kit
to
collect
evidence
from
the
boy's
body.
the
police
also
collected
the
boy's
clothing
which
they
failed
to
refrigerate.
a
police
criminologist
later
performed
some
tests
on
this
evidence
but
he
was
unable
to
obtain
information
about
the
identity
of
the
boy's
assailant.
at
trial,
expert
witnesses
testified
that
respondent
might
have
been
completely
exhaunerated
by
timely
performance
of
test
with
properly
preserved
evidence.
respondent
was
convicted
of
child-molestation,
sexual
assault,
and
kidnapping
in
an
arizona
state
court.
the
arizona
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
conviction
on
the
ground
that
the
state
had
breach
a
constitutional
duty
to
preserve
the
evidence
from
the
victim's
body
and
clothing.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
unless
a
criminal
defendant
can
show
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
the
police.
failure
to
preserve
potentially
useful
evidence
does
not
constitute
a
denial
of
due
process
of
law.
here,
the
police's
failure
to
refrigerate
the
victim's
clothing
and
to
perform
certain
tests
on
the
evidence
can
at
worst
be
described
as
negligent.
none
of
this
information
was
concealed
from
respondent
at
trial
and
the
evidence,
such
as
it
was,
was
made
available
to
respondent's
expert
who
declined
to
perform
any
tests
on
it.
the
arizona
court
of
appeals
noted
in
its
opinion
that
there
was
no
suggestion
of
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
the
police.
it
follows,
therefore,
that
there
was
no
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
and
the
judgment
of
the
arizona
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
brennan
and
marshall
have
joined.
