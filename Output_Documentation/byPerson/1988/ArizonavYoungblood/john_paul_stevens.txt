mr.
gustafson,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
because
it's
kind
of
hard
to
piece
all
these
tests
together?
but
am
i...
just
see...
am
i
correct
in
saying
two
things?
one,
that
if
they
had
preformed
the
test
that
showed
that
the
semen
samples
were
the
product
of
a
person
who
was
a
nonsecretor,
that
would
have
been
a
complete
defense
for
the
defendant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
secondly,
what
i
want
to
know
is
did
you
at
the
time
you
had
these
samples
and
before
the
second
trial,
have
tests
available
that
could
have
been
performed
to
determine
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
at
any
time
before
the
second
trial,
could
you
have
performed
tests
which
would
have
determined
whether
or
not
the
donor
was
a
nonsecretor?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
it
could
have
done
that.
and
then
the
case
boils
down
to
whether
you
had
any
obligation
to
do
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
as
far
as
that's
concerned,
even
at
the
time
of
the
second
trial,
it
still
was
not
too
late
to
do
the
p-30
on
the
swab.
it
was
too
late
to
do
it
on
the
clothing,
but
it
was
still
not
too
late
to
do
it
on
the
swab,
was
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
defendant
could
have
done
that
himself--
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
it
true
that
only
about
20
percent
of
the
population
are
nonsecretors?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
if
you
had
a...
i
mean,
so
the
odds
would
be
about
four
to
one
that
you'd
get...
that
the
reason
for
the
no
blood
type
showing
up
is
that
the
sample
was
too
small.
and
he
elected
not
to
take
that
chance
because
he
wanted
to
make
his
reasonable
doubt
argument.
but
why
wouldn't
the
state
go
ahead
and
do
it
anyway
because
presumably
they're
interested
in
knowing
the
truth?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
even
by
the
time
you
get
to
the
second
trial,
i
would
think
the
state
would
have
an
interest
in
finding
the
answer
to
that
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gustafson,
this
wasn't
such
a
case.
this
wouldn't
have
added
to
your
proof
of
guilt
even
if
it
hadn't
helped
the
defendant.
it
was
kind
of
a
one-way
street,
wasn't
it?
it
would
either
exonerate
or
be
neutral.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which,
in
effect,
enhances
the
state's
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
davis,
supposing
the
semen
sample
had
been
lost
because
there
was
a
fire
in
the
police
station--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--would
it
be
a
deprivation
of
due
process
still?
