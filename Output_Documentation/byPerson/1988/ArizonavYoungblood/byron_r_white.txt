all
right.
or
from
the
semen
or
from
the
swab.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
test
could
you
have
performed
before
the
second
trial
that
you
were
referring
to
justice
stevens?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
tests
could
you
have
performed?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
whom?
on
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
you
would
have
been
performing
a
test
on
the
swab?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
do
what?
to
determine
whether?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
have
had
to
go
and
have
a
blood
type
test.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
they
had
read
the
police
reports,
they
would
have
known
the
clothing
and
the
swab
were
in
existence.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
the
reports
are
available
to
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
they
had
read
it,
as
they
could
have,
they
would
have
known
about
the
swab
and
the
clothing.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
test
the
state
could
have
performed,
if
it
came
out
one
way,
would
have
completely
exonerated
the
defendant?
and
the
state
just
didn't...
and
the
state
knew
that,
and
it
thought
without
the
test
it
could
convict
anyway.
so,
it
just
didn't
perform
the
test.
now,
that
is...
that
is...
that
would
be
questionable
under
trombetta,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
suppose
the
police
has
this
item
which,
if
it
tested
one
way
would
exonerate,
and
it
tells
the
defendant,
look,
we
have
this
item.
we
haven't
tested
it,
but
we'll
tell
you
that
if
it
comes
out
one
way,
you're
exonerated;
if
it
comes
out
the
other,
you're
really...
you're
really...
it
will
help
prove
you
guilty.
and
the
defendant
doesn't
test
it
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if...
but
if
the...
but
the
tests...
if
the
defendant
had
done
it...
had
run
these
tests,
it
might
have...
if
it
came
out
one
way,
it
would
have
destroyed
his
reasonable
doubt
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
you
said
a
while
ago
it
was
a
tactical
choice
for
him
not
to
test.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
did
you
first
have
the
opportunity
to
know
that
there
was
a
swab
and
that
there
were
clothing?
justice
byron
r.
white
well--
justice
byron
r.
white
--do
you...
do
you
at
least
by
the
time
of
the
first
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
knew
that?
and
the
tests
could
have
been
performed
then
by
the
defense.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the...
do
you
contest
the
notion
that
the
clothing
and
the
swab
are
mentioned
in
the
police
reports?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
they
were
and
they
were
available
to
the
defendant.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
they
read
them,
they
knew
about
the
clothing
and
the
swab
at
a
time
when
tests
would
be
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
wouldn't
that
be
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
wasn't
incriminating.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the
police
had
not
taken
a
swab
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes.
but
the
police
could
have
taken
the
swab.
they
could
have
performed
the
right
test,
or
they
could
have
preserved
it
for
you
to
make
the
tests.
do
they
have
to
take
the
swab?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
they
have
to
take
the
swab?
is
it
their
constitutional
duty--
justice
byron
r.
white
your
answer
to
my
question
apparently
is
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
suppose
the
answer
is
no.
do
you
lose
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
they
gathered
the
evidence
and
let
it
fritter
away.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
conclusively
exonerating
if
it
comes
out
one
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
about
the
other
way?
if
it
comes
out
the
other
way,
does
it
help
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
isn't
conclusive
for
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
what...
so,
what's
your
standard?
what
did
the
court
below
say?
might
have?
would
have?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
ruled
for
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
well,
what
do
you
mean
by
strong
showing?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
have
in
all
likelihood.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
if
it
came
out
one
way,
it
would
have
helped
you
get
off.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
are
the
chances
of
it
being
prejudicial...
i
mean,
of
it
being
helpful
to
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
the
only
thing
that
can
possibly
happen
to
him
in
the
test
is
that...
is
that
it
will
eliminate
his
reasonable
doubt
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
when
the
tests...
when
the
evidence
was
gathered,
they
had
no
suspect.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so,
they
may
or
may
not
ever
have
had
a
suspect.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
i
guess
the
claim
is
that
the
state
must
preserve
this...
the
clothing
and
the
swab
for
as
long
as
the
case
is
open.
