yes.
well,
does
the
record
indicate
that
those
tests
would
have
achieved
a
valid
result
if
there
was
enough
of
a
sample
to
make
a
conclusion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
thing
that
was
being
estimated
was
whether
or
not
there
was
a
sufficient
quantity
to
go
ahead
and
make
the
test
for
the
blood
group?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
xxx
that
doesn't
change
anything?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
there
testimony
that
it
would
be
absolutely
futile
to
go
to
the
swab
and
attempt
a
test
for
blood
groups?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
we're
talking
about
the
time
of
trial.
at
the
time--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--of
the
trial,
youngblood
was
within
that
80
percent
of
the
population
that
is
a
secretor.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
that's
true,
if
a
material
witness
dies,
you're
exonerated.
you
can't...
certainly
there
must
be
a
difference
between
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
police
and
the
situation
justice
stevens
poses
in
which
the
station
just
burns
down.
i
assume
that
would
be
a
logical
line
for
us
to
draw
between
those
two
instances.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
agree
that
on
the
state
of
this
record,
that
after
six
weeks,
the
samples
on
the
clothing
had
deteriorated
so
that
a
useful
test
could
not
be
made?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
gustafson,
do
you
agree
that
the
p-30
test
doesn't
do
anything
except
tell
you
how
much--
