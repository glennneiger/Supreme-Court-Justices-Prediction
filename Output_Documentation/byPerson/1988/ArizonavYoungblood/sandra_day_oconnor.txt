mr.
gustafson,
did
the
defense
ask
for
any
brady
materials
in
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
does
the
record
show,
if
anything,
that
the
state
disclosed
to
the
defense
about
the
existence
of
the
swab
and
the
clothing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
police
report
shows
that
there
was
a
rectal
swab
and
some
clothing
of
the
victim?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--did
the
defense
ever
ask
to
examine
these
items
to
do
their
own
testing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
didn't
the
state
conduct
tests
on
the
clothing
for
the
blood
group
do
you
suppose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
didn't
the
state
test
the
swab
with
the
p-30
test?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
gustafson,
i
take
it
the
state,
the
prosecution,
did
not
offer
any
of
this
scientific
analysis
evidence
in
trial...
at
trial.
the
state
just
went
to
trial
with
the
eye
witness
identification
and
the
testimony
of
the
victim
and
the
physical
clothing.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
the
state
hadn't
taken
tests
and
so
that
wasn't
part
of
the
evidence.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
they
couldn't--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--get
a
test
result.
so,
no
test
results
were
offered.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
hard
for
me
to
understand,
frankly.
we're
talking
about
the
guilt
phase
of
the
trial.
was
the
clothing
introduced?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
whose
case
do
you
think
it
hurt
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
state
failed
to
do
some
of
its
homework,
so
to
speak?
did
it
hurt
the
state's
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
instruction
to
the
jury
told
them
they
could
use
the
state's
failure
against
the
state?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
yet
they
came
in
with
a
verdict
of
guilty.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
they
also
knew
about
it
because
of
the
first
trial--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--don't
you
suppose?
were
they
offered
in
evidence
at
the
first
trial?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
there
was
no
question,
but
that
at
the
time
of
the
second
trial
they
fully
understood--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--what
the
state's
evidence
consisted
of.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
any
event,
when
did
the
defense
know
that
the
victim's
clothing
had
been
obtained
by
the
police
and
that
a
swab
had
been
taken?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
defense
knew
quite
early
on
that
these
items
existed
and
presumably
could
have
made
a
demand
to
have
them
tested.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
swab
had
been
refrigerated.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
it
wasn't
meaningless
as
to
that.
and
it
wasn't
meaningless
for
all
purposes
with
regard
to
the
clothing.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
certainly
an
objection
was
made
and
an
argument
to
the
jury
that
it
was...
the
state
should
have
done
this
testing,
and
that
there
was
a
reasonable
doubt
because
it
wasn't
done.
right?
so,
that
worked
to
the
advantage
of
the
defendant.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
tests
do
we
employ?
it
seems
to
me
this
really
isn't
as
much
like
trombetta
as
it
is
like
just
lost
evidence.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
state
didn't
offer,
as
in
trombetta,
the
results
of
some
scientific
testing
that
the
defendant
then
couldn't
rebut.
here
the
state
simply
failed
to
preserve,
in
the
fashion
that
might
have
been
better,
a
piece
of
the
evidence,
but
didn't
offer
any
scientific
tests
as
a
result
because
it
couldn't
do
them
either.
so,
it's
more
like
lost
evidence,
isn't
it?
and
don't
we
then
have
to
look
at
the
bad
faith,
if
any,
of
the
state?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
suppose
it's
a
drunk
driving
case.
and
the
policeman
observes
the
driver
and
the
erratic
behavior
and
the
slurred
speech
and
the
bleary
eyes
and
smells
whatever
he
smells,
but
doesn't
take
a
breath-a-lyzer
test.
and
the
defendant
says,
well,
i
was
a
diabetic
and
that
explains
my
behavior.
now,
does
the
state
in
these
cases
have
an
obligation
to
take
a
breath-a-lyzer
test?
in
your
view,
that
would
be
a
constitutional
requirement.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes?
