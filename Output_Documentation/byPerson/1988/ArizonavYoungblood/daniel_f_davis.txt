mr.
daniel
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
tell
the
state
of
arizona
that
they
needed
to
preserve
or
to
test
this
evidence
because
nobody
had
to
tell
the
police
of
the
need
to
preserve
and
test
this
evidence.
they
knew
that
if
that
clothing
had
been
placed
in
the
refrigerator,
in
accordance
with
the
normal
practice
of
the
tucson
police
department
investigating
an
ordinary
sexual
assault,
that
the
defense
could
then
test
that
evidence,
and
it
would
be
available
to
them.
the
defense
did
not
make
the
tactical
decision
not
to
test
that
clothing.
the
tactical
decision
was
made
for
them
when
the
police
failed
to
follow
their
ordinary
routine
procedures
in
preserving
that
evidence
for
later
testing.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
i
don't
know
the
precise
date,
your
honor,
and
i
was
not
trial
counsel.
however,
i
do
know
that
it
was
after
december
10,
1983.
mr.
youngblood
was
arrested
december
10,
1983,
six
weeks
to
the
day
after
the
assault
occurred.
mr.
inman
testified
as
a
criminalist
for
the
defense
and
talked
about
the
deterioration
of
these
markers.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
on
december
10,
such
a
request
would
have
been
meaningless.
they
knew
of
them
at
that
time,
but
because
these
are
organic
elements,
they
break
down
in
a
matter
of
two
or
three
weeks.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
i
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
your
honor,
with
regard
to
the
swab,
the
testing...
we
could
continue
to
do
testing
today,
but
it
is
most
unlikely
that
anything
would
develop
from
the
swab.
it
is
merely
the
size
of
a
q-tip.
it
has
already
been
subjected
to
some
testing.
but
i
agree
today
that
it
may
be
a
viable
product
for
testing,
but
it
is
most
unlikely
that
there
is
anything
in
there
worthy
of
testing.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
now,
as
to
the
clothing
which
both
criminalists
agree
contains
the
better
semen
sample,
the
larger
sample,
the
better
preserved
sample,
that...
testing
of
that
was
impossible
as
of
december
10.
the
abo
blood
markers
deteriorate
over
roughly
the
same
period
of
time
as
the
pgm
blood
markers
which
deteriorate
over
a
two
or
three
week
period
if
not
refrigerated.
if
refrigerated,
they
can
maintain
their
viability
potentially
for
years.
the
p-30
molecule
deteriorates
at
approximately
the
same
rate
of
deterioration
as
both
the
abo
and
pgm
markers.
hence,
when
you
test
for
the
p-30
molecule
and
find
very
little
of
it,
you
can
also
conclude
that
you're
not
likely
to
find
much
of
the
abo
or
pgm
markers.
but
the
last
test
that
has
been
mentioned
is
the
acid
phosphatase
test.
that
tests
for
the
presence
of
a
much
more
durable
component
of
semen,
but
a
component
which
does
not
provide
any
way
of
distinguishing
between
various
semen
donors.
we
could
do
the
test
today,
but
it
would
tend
to
prove
no
fact
that's
in
dispute
today.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
that
is
part
of
our
complaint,
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
that
they
failed
to
preserve
it
so
that
we
could
perform
the
tests.
for
instance,
in
california
v.
trombetta,
the
evidence
was
tested
immediately,
the
breath,
and
then
disposed
of.
but
the
results
of
that
test
then
became
the
evidence.
the
semen
in
this
case
was
not
evidence
in
and
of
itself,
but
the
results
of
testing
on
the
semen
would
be
evidence.
had
the
semen
been
reliably
tested
early
on,
we
would
have
no
complaint
about
its
destruction
if
the
reliable
test
results
were
available.
but
because
they
chose
not
to
do
the
test,
then
we
insist
they
must
not
make
that
choice
for
us,
but
rather
merely
place
the
clothing
in
the
refrigerators,
as
they
ordinarily
do,
so
that
we
can
make
the
decision
as
to
whether
to
test
that
clothing
or
not.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
well--
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
--no,
your
honor,
with
that
i
take
some
exception.
if
we
were
to
allow
the
government
to
simply
destroy
evidence
that
came
into
their
hands
and
then
require
that
we
show
bad
faith
on
their
part,
we
would
essentially--
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
--well,
in
the
first
place--
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
--well,
in
the
first
instance,
i
think
that...
in
the
first
place,
i
think
that
looking
at
cases
like
valenzuela-bernal
indicate
that
what
we
are
primarily
concerned
with
is
the
content
or
the
evidence,
whichever
way
it
falls.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
they
made
the
conscious
decision
to
dispose
of
that
evidence
after
determining
that
the
evidence
had
no
probative
value
for
either
side,
and
the
defense
could
not
counter
that
argument.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
well,
if...
i
think
that
brady
and
agurs
and
that
line
of
cases.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
they're
not
squarely
on
point.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
well,
if
i
may,
your
honor.
if
we
must
prove
bad
faith
in
the
government's
conduct
in
failing
to
preserve
evidence,
that
is
a
way
around
brady
and
agurs
because
rather
than
merely
not
disclosing
the
evidence,
they
simply
choose
to
allow
it
to
deteriorate,
and
in
that
way
they
avoid
the
sanctions
of
agurs
and
brady
and
the
opportunity
of
the
defense...
to
present
his
own
defense.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
again,
since
i
did
not
try
the
case,
i
don't
know
the
precise
date.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
it
would
have
to
be--
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
--certainly.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
no,
your
honor.
by
that
time
the
tests
would
have
been
impossible.
the
clothing--
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
--i
assume
that
they
were,
and
i
would
assume--
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
--i
will
assume
that
they
were.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
no,
sir.
that
is
where
i--
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
--because
the
arrest
occurred
six
weeks
after
the
samples
were
taken.
the
deterioration
of
the
samples
would
have
occurred
in
the
first
two
or
three
weeks
following
the
gathering
of
the
evidence
because
it
was
not
refrigerated.
by
the
time
mr.
youngblood
was
arrested,
the
clothing
samples
had
deteriorated
beyond
forensic
usefulness,
and
there
was
nothing
left
to
test
on
the
clothing
that
could
in
any
way
address
any
of
the
disputed
issues
in
the
case.
and
that
is
precisely
why--
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
--yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
no,
sir.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
well,
sir--
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
--that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
in
order
to
get
anything
out
of
the
swab,
we
would
have
to
test
it
by
some
means
other
than
by
a
p-30
analysis.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
because
if
we
knew
the
amount
of
p-30
protein
on
that...
the
swab
today,
it
would
still
not
tell
us
anything
about
the
test
that
was
conducted
on
a
portion
of
that
swab
years
ago
because
it
would
not
tell
us
whether
an
adequate
sample
had
been
tested
then.
and
that
is
really
the
crucial
issue
is
whether
they
tested
an
adequate
sample
from
the
swab.
again,
when
i
talk
about
a
remote
likelihood--
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
--well,
because
the
only
tests
that
we
have
that
we
can
look
to
are
the
ones
that
were
performed
for
the
blood
markers,
for
instance,
on
the
swab.
and
he
says
i
performed
a
test
on
some
unknown
amount
of
semen
at
a
certain
point
in
time
and
found
that
either
i
didn't
test
enough
or
that
the
assailant
was
a
nonsecretor.
to
know
how
much
remains
on
the
swab
doesn't
tell
us
how
much
was
tested
in
that
first
test
to
help
point
us
in
one
direction
or
the
other.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
no.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
no,
it
was
not.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
that
was
the
opinion
of
the
state's
criminalist
was
that
there
was
not
enough
to
retest.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
he
said
he
could
go
back
and
retest
it--
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
--but
he
didn't
think
that
there
was
enough
there.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
well,
it
seemed
to
be
enough
to
satisfy
the
state.
i've
not
seen
anything
in
the
record--
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
--but
the
situation
that
we're
in,
we're
doing
destructive
testing.
if
we'd
performed
these
tests
on
the
swab...
if
we
perform
a
p-30
analysis
on
the
swab,
all
that
it
tells
us
is
that
there
was
enough
left
on
the
swab.
it
does
not
tell
us
anything
about
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
any
person.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
if
there
was
in
the
amount
that
had
been
tested,
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
perhaps...
i'm
obviously
not
making
myself
understood.
perhaps...
let's
assume
that
there
were
100
units
of
some
measurement
of
semen
on
the
swab
originally.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
the
first
test
is
conducted.
it
is
to
determine
the
blood
markers.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
and
let
us
assume
that
they
used
20
of
these
units
to
perform
that
test.
and
they
then
don't
know
whether
it
is
an
insufficient
sample
or
whether
he
is
a
nonsecretor.
but
we
don't
know...
it
was
never
quantified
in
the
first
place.
we
never
knew
we
had
this
100
units.
we're
doing
this
hypothetically.
i
now
go
back
and
retest
that
swab
and
discover
that
there
are
80
units
left.
i
have
now
destroyed
the
ability
to
test
that
swab
any
further,
and
all
it
has
told
me
was
that
if
i
had
not
performed
this
test,
that
if
i
had
gone
back
and
performed
some
other
test,
i
might
have
been
able
to
identify
the
assailant.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
you
test...
it
depends
on
the
test
you're
using.
now,
the
p-30--
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
--will
only
tell
you
the
amount
that's
there.
it
will
not
tell
you
anything
about
the
assailant.
the
abo
test,
which
was
the
test
that
was
in
use
at
the
time,
would
tell
you
information
about
the
assailant
and
narrow
him
into
one
of
the
four
basic
blood
groups
or
into
the
nonsecretor
blood
group.
but
those
are
mutually
exclusive
because
they
are
destructive
tests.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
i'm
not
sure
what
it's
function
is.
i
don't
know
why
they
do
it,
and
i
know
that...
for
instance,
i
suspect
that
where
you
have
a
case
in
which
there
is
dispute
about
whether
an
assault
occurred,
but
the
identity
is
not
in
dispute,
you
may
perform
a
test
like
a...
the
p-30
test
to
determine
the
presence
or
absence
of
semen.
the
other
test,
the
acid
phosphatase
test,
would
not
give
you
that
information
with
regard
to
an
ordinary
rape
situation.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
the
only
testimony
was
that
he
considered
it
highly
unlikely,
and
that
was
the
police
criminalist
who
had
custody
of
the
swab
and
who
had
done
the
initial
analysis.
and
as
he
indicated,
particularly
with
regard
to
these
sexual
assaults...
these
rectal
swabs...
you
will
find...
he
said
that
only
in
about
10
percent
of
the
cases
do
you
find
much...
do
you
find
any
semen
to
test
in
a
rectal
swab
precisely
because
most
of
the
semen
has
drained
out
of
the
body
and
into
the
clothing.
and
so,
they
gathered
the
clothing
and
intended
to
put
it
in
a
refrigerator,
but
because
of
some
error,
they
put
it
in
a
wooden
locker
instead.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
well,
then
we
would
certainly
have
a
different
situation.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
i
would
hope
that--
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
--my
position
is
yes--
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
--that
they
have
an
obligation
to
make...
to
help...
to
act
as--
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
--yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
no,
sir,
because
this
is
a
case--
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
--yes,
sir,
just
as
they
gathered
broveck's
confession
in
the
brady
case
and
just
as
they
gathered
the
information
about
linda
agurs'
victim
in
her
case.
this
is
not
a
case
where
we're
telling
them
to
do
this.
they
have
every
incentive
in
the
world
to
gather
this
evidence
so
that
they
can
exclude
innocent
people
from
consideration
and
remain
on
the
trail
of
the
guilty
party
while
the
trail
is
fresh.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
or
that
he
at
least
have
some--
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
--no,
ma'am.
that
he
also
has
an
opportunity
to
gather
the
sample.
so,
the
police
would
not
in
that
case.
and
that
is
where
i
would
draw
that
distinction
as
in
trombetta
where
trombetta
has
access
to
his
own
breath
sample
at
a
time
when
it
could
be
preserved.
but
mr.
youngblood
had
no
opportunity
whatsoever
to
gather
the
semen
samples
in
this
case.
they
either
must
be
gathered
by
the
police
or
they
will
never
be
gathered
at
all.
and
this
evidence
is
so
potentially
conclusive
that
it
is...
that
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
standard
police
procedure
in
tucson,
in
pima
county
and
elsewhere--
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
--absolutely.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
oh,
it
certainly
does.
it
certainly...
the
state
can
come
in
then
and
they
can
say,
well,
we
have
been
able
to
conclusively
establish
that
80
percent
of
the
potential
semen
donors
out
there
could
not
have
done
it.
it
just
so
happens,
though,
that
the
physical
description
of
this
defendant
matches
the
description
given
by
the
victim
and,
furthermore,
that
he
is
still
in
that
small
20
percent
or
even
narrower
category
of
people
who
could
have
committed
the
crime.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
it
is
today,
not
with
the
technology
available
then.
but
today,
they
can
narrow
it
down
with
these
genetic
tests
to
a
single
person,
and
the
only
person
who
would
profit
from
the
loss
then
is
the
criminal
who
committed
the
crime.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
i
agree.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
that's
correct.
he
is
a
type
a
secretor.
and
given
that,
it's...
it
is
of
tremendous
benefit
to
the
state
and
it
works
both
ways
for
the
state.
it
helps
them
investigate
the
offense
because
it
keeps
them
from
being
brought
off
the
trail
with
false
leads.
it
helps
them
to
bolster
their
case
when
they
finally
have
brought
an
individual
to
court
by
saying
we
have
excluded
all
of
these--
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
--no,
your
honor.
and
this
court
didn't
tell
them
how
to
investigate.
they
knew
how
material
and
important
this
evidence
was
at
the
outset,
and
they
intended
to
gather
this
evidence
precisely
for
the
purpose
that
we
intend
to
use
it
for,
to
prove
the
innocence
of
the
innocent.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
bad
faith,
i
would
submit,
is
not
at
issue.
we're
looking
at
the
right
of
the
accused
to
defend
himself.
and
what
i
would
look
to--
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
--i'm
sorry
if
i've
misled
the
court
in
that
way.
i
don't
claim
that
they
should
reverse
simply
because
every
piece
of
evidence
has
not
been
preserved.
and,
in
fact,
i'm
not
claiming
that
they
should
reverse
in
every
case
in
which
semen
samples
are
not
preserved.
in
this
case,
before
the
court
of
appeals
would
entertain
our
request
to
reverse
the
conviction
and
order
a
dismissal,
we
were
required
to
make
a
strong
showing
of
prejudice.
we
had
to
show
that
that
evidence
could
have
helped
us.
in
fact,
the
first
arizona
case
that
held
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
police
must
preserve
semen
samples
refused
to
reverse
the
conviction
for
precisely
the
reason
that
they
said
there
is
no
harm
here.
the
evidence
of
guilt
is
overwhelming.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
no,
sir.
the
court
below
first
said
that
we
must--
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
--make
a
strong
showing
of
prejudice--
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
--because
we
made
that
strong
showing
of
prejudice.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
they
required
that
we
first
show
that
there
is
a
genuine
issue
of
misidentification
and
that
this
evidence
could
have
in
all
likelihood--
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
--provided--
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
--it
would
have
absolutely.
he
would
never
even
had
to
stand
trial
most
likely.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
well,
first
of
all--
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
--well,
there's
the--
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
--the
other
testimony,
the
other
evidence
at
trial
consisted
solely
of
the
testimony
of
the
victim.
at
the
first
trial,
we
got
a
lot
of
information
about
what
this
victim
had
described
at
the
time
that
the
attack
was
vivid
in
his
mind,
that
very
night.
he
described
a
gray-haired
man
with
a
straight
hairline
who
was
wearing
hard,
plastic
or
leather
shoes,
driving
a
two-door
automobile
and
who
in
almost
every
material
component
of
that
description
was
not
mr.
youngblood.
mr.
youngblood's
hairline
is
different.
he
has
never
had
gray
hair.
his
automobile
is
a
four-door.
he
despises
the
kind
of
music
that
was
being
played.
he
cannot
put
his
feet
in
leather
or
plastic
shoes
because
they
are
so
callused.
he
always
wears
cloth
shoes.
and
as
you
watch
from
the
first
trial
to
the
second
trial,
the
victim's
testimony
shifts,
and
he
moves
away
from
the
initial
description
that
he
gave
to
the
police
and
more
toward
a
description
focused
toward
mr.
youngblood.
the
police
told
him
at
the
time
of
mr.
youngblood's
arrest
that
they
arrested
the
man
who
did
it.
they
showed
him
a
photo
lineup
six
photos
in
it,
and
the
victim
picked
two
of
the
six
as
being
his
assailant.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
i
agree.
and
not
only
is
that
important
for
the
jury,
but
because...
as
this
court
held
in
bagley,
what
we
are
concerned
about
is
our
level
of
confidence
in
the
jury's
final
holding.
that's
the
reason
why
the
court
of
appeals
asked
itself
whether
the
evidence
was
so
conclusive,
so
overwhelming
that
the
loss
of
the
semen
sample
is
meaningless
or
that
the
loss
of
the
semen
sample
could
not
have
given
anything
to
the
defense
of
this
case.
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
again,
that
is
why--
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
--yes,
your
honor,
because
it
is
a
matter
that
the
evidence
is
lost,
good
faith
or
bad
faith.
i
would
urge
that
a
different
test
would
apply
if
we
could
prove
bad
faith
because
i
would
hope
that
we
would
want
to
deter
that.
but
even
the
innocent
loss
of
that
evidence
has
the
same
effect
on
the
defendant
as
the
most
malicious
loss
of
that
evidence.
it
deprives
him
of
his
opportunity
to
vindicate
his
innocence.
and
because
of
the
fact
that
the--
mr.
daniel
f.
davis
--i
think
that
the
line
is
going
to
be
drawn
at
a
number
of
other
points
as
well.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
hold...
and
i
do
not
advocate
a
position...
that
the
loss
of
evidence
automatically
results
in
any
particular
sanction.
if
the
evidence
is
lost
through
inadvertence,
that
in
and
of
itself
is
some
evidence
that
perhaps
that
bit
of
data
was
not
material
or
significant
in
any
particular
way
because
the
police
didn't
bother
to
gather
it,
the
defense
didn't
draw
the
police
attention
to
it.
and
so,
that
would
come
into
play
there.
but
if
the
police
are
exercising
reasonable
care
in
following
their
procedures
and
the
evidence
is
still
lost,
that
is
of
small
benefit
to
the
accused
who
finds
that
he
cannot
put
on
his
defense
as
a
result
of
the
loss
of
that
evidence.
and
for
those
reasons,
i
would
urge
that
good
faith
and
bad
faith
not
enter
into
the
question
at
this
stage,
but
that
instead,
unless...
if
the
defense
can
prove
bad
faith,
then
i
would
say
that
that
is
a
different
case
and
it's
not
worthy
of
the
same
standard
here.
but
when
we
have...
when
everybody
intended
to
gather
the
evidence,
intended
to
test
the
evidence
and
intended
to
preserve
the
evidence,
and
then
simply
failed
to
do
so,
we
must
look
at
the...
our
conviction
in...
regarding
the
fairness
of
the
trial
and
our
certainty
that
the
outcome
is
a
reliable
one.
and
because
those
should
be
the
guiding
principles
as
far
as
fashioning
the
remedy,
the
courts
should
be
given
broad
latitude
in
providing
remedies
ranging
from
absolutely
nothing
at
all
to
jury
instructions
to
instructions
that
certain
facts
must
be
presumed
to
the
contrary
of
the
position
taken
by
the
spoliator.
and
finally,
in
some
cases,
in
order
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
the
judicial
process,
after
the
court,
as
the
arizona
court
of
appeals
did,
considered
all
other
sanctions,
the
court
may
find
that
fairness
and
due
process
require
a
dismissal
of
the
charges.
that
sanction
should
be
available
to
the
court.
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
record
before
this
court
reviewed
those
various
options
and
made
it
very
clear
that
they
were
aware
of
the
range
of
potential
sanctions
and
found
that
it
is
only
because...
that
it
is
only
a
dismissal
of
the
charges
that
can
protect
mr.
youngblood's
due
process
rights...
did
they
order
a
dismissal
of
the
charges.
thank
you.
