mr.
john
r.
gustafson
gustafson.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
concerns
whether
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires
dismissal
of
a
state
criminal
conviction
for
the
alleged
failure
of
police
to
properly
preserve
and
to
test
certain
materials
obtained
from
a
rape
victim.
the
respondent
was
convicted
by
a
jury
of
crimes
involving
the
rape
of
a
boy.
the
arizona
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
respondent
was
denied
due
process
because
of
police
inaction
in
two
areas:
first,
that
police
did
not
perform
certain
tests
on
materials
they
had
obtained
from
the
rape
victim.
these
materials
were
properly
preserved
as
they
were
refrigerated.
and
secondly,
the
police
did
not
refrigerate
the
victim's
undergarments
that
they
had
obtained
when
the
victim
went
to
the
hospital.
the
lower
court
found
that
these
inactions
on
the
part
of
the
police
constituted
a
due
process
violation
requiring
reversal
of
the
jury's
verdicts
and
dismissal
of
the
prosecution.
it
is
the
state's
position
that
the
lower
court
has
substituted
speculation
about
the
evidentiary
value
of
these
materials
for
the
constitutional
standard
of
materiality
and
in
doing
so,
has
obviated
the
role
of
the
jury
as
the
trier
of
fact.
the
circumstances
regarding
the
collection
of
the
evidence
in
question
are
as
follows.
on
october
29,
the
10
year
old
boy
was
kidnapped
and
raped.
omitting
the
details
of
the
crime,
he
was
taken
to
the
hospital
shortly
after
the
offense.
at
the
hospital
the
boy
was
treated
for
his
injuries
and,
in
addition,
the
treating
physician
used
what
is
known
as
a
sexual
assault
kit.
it's
a
device.
it's
a
device...
it's
a
kit
that
collects
evidence
from
different
areas.
but
in
this
particular
instance,
the
physician
used
a
swab,
swabbed
the
boy's
rectum,
made
a
microscopic
slide
of
the
contents
of
the
smear,
gave
it
to
police
who
refrigerated
it.
and
that
was
the
proper
thing
to
do.
at
the
time,
the
police
also
gathered
the
boy's
undershirt
and
his
underpants.
those
were
placed
in
a
bag
and
placed
in
property,
and
they
were
not
refrigerated.
about
nine
days
after
the
gathering
of
that
evidence,
the
police
criminologist
examined
the
microscope
slide
obtained
at
the
hospital.
he
found
that
there
was
spermatozoa
present
on
the
slide,
but
found
only
a
small
portion
of
it.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
no,
and
they
don't
need
to.
under
the
arizona
rules
of
criminal
discovery,
we're
obligated
to
give
that
to
them.
we
have
to--
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
--the
record
shows...
there's
an
absence
in
the
record
on
this
part.
the
police
disclosure--
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
--excuse
me?
there's
an
absence
in
the
record--
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
--the
police
disclosure
or
the
state's
disclosure
in
this
case
is
its
formal
police
reports
which
are
given
directly
to
defense
counsel.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
yes.
now,
what's
clear
is
that
10
days
after
his
arraignment...
we
will
bring
this
to
december
20...
there
was
supposed
to
be
a
preliminary
hearing
which
wasn't
held.
that
is
at
the
time
that
the
state
had
to
issue
its
disclosure.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
okay.
yes.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
but
i
cannot
say
at
the
exact
time
that
they
knew
about
the
existence
of...
because
there
was
a
continuing
process
of
disclosure.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
no,
they
did
not.
the--
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
--the...
they
eventually...
to
put
it
in
a
nutshell,
they
were
put
into
property
and
no
one
asked
the
police
criminalist
to
examine
them
for
over
a
year.
they
were
not
examined.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
an
evidence
locker.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
yes,
in
a
paper
bag.
they
were
not
refrigerated
or
anything
like
that.
police
collected
at
the
scene,
put
in
a
bag
and
placed
into
evidence.
after
the
police
criminologist
examined
the
microscope
slide,
which
was
nine
days
after
the
crime,
some
six
weeks
or
five
weeks
after
that
examination,
the
respondent
was
arrested.
his
mental
competency
was
called
into
question.
the
case
was
stayed
for
about
eight
months
pending
the
resolution
of
that.
discovery
still
continued
during
that
period
of
time.
the
state
then
asked
on
october
15
to
obtain
samples
from
the
respondent
for
comparison.
that
was
denied
by
the
trial
court.
when
the
case
first
came
to
trial,
which
was
in
december
of
1984,
the
defense
called
the
criminologist
who
did
not
examine
any
of
the
evidence,
either
the
rectal
swab
slide
or
the
underwear.
he
testified
only
regarding...
in
general
matters
about
the
existence...
what
might
or
might
not
be
found
upon
these
materials.
the
defense
at
trial
used
this
to
create...
as
an
attempt
to
create
a
reasonable
doubt
in
the
jury's
mind.
the
police
criminalist
had...
had
tested
the
rectal
swab
shortly
before
trial
and
determined
that
it
did
not
have--
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
--it
was.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
that's
correct.
it
was
a
year
after.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
there
wasn't...
contamination
wasn't
shown
on
the
sample
that
was
refrigerated.
the
defense
expert
stated...
eliminated...
since
it
was
refrigerated,
eliminated
the
possibility
of
bacterial
contamination
because
it
had
been
refrigerated.
in
fact,
at
the
lower
court,
the
respondent
had
asked
in
his
opening
brief
that
the
case
be
remanded
for
possible
retesting
of
that
refrigerated
thing.
but
i
don't
think
it
was
established
that
that
was
contaminated.
there
was
some
speculation
as
to
that.
at
trial
the
respondent's
position
about
the
testing
was
this.
since
the
abo
blood
test
done
on
the
sexual
assault
kit
determined
that
there
was
no
blood
type
on
it,
that
raised
two
possibilities.
it
was
either
that
that
sample
was
insufficient
when
it
was
gathered,
or
that
the
true
assailant...
this
is
according
to
the
respondent...
was
part
of
20
to
25
percent
of
the
population
who
do
not
secret
their
blood
type
into
their
other
bodily
fluids.
at
that
trial
the
defense
expert
also
questioned
about
the
underwear,
essentially
that
that
would
be
a
good
place
to
look,
or
it...
frequently,
in
his
experience,
that
semen
would
be
found
upon
it.
that
trial
resulted
in
the
hung
jury.
following
that
trial,
the
police
had
obtained
a
new
test,
which
is
called
the
p-30
test.
that
test
had
been
used
in
only...
it
was
of
recent
vintage
and
had
been
used
by
about
50
percent
of
the
crime
laboratories
in
the
country.
and
the
tucson
police
department
obtained
that
test,
and
then
they
tested
that
sample
in
january.
again--
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
--in
january
they
tested
the
underwear.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
yes.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
that's
correct.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
either
the
police
criminalist...
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
record.
either
he
was
not
asked
to
do
so,
or
in
his
opinion
the
sample
was
just
too
small
to
get
a
result
from
that
test.
now,
the...
at
the
second
trial,
although
this
was
all
in
question
at
the
first
trial...
at
the
second
trial,
the
respondent
used
the
former
trial
testimony
of
his
expert.
they
didn't
do
any
retesting
or
any
testing
at
all
of
the
evidence.
it's
the
state's
position
that
in
a
situation
like
this,
we
have
to
look
at,
as
this
court
did
in
california
v.
trombetta,
to
two
focus
points
as
to
the
constitutional
standard
of
materiality.
first
is
whether
or
not
the
evidence
had
exculpatory
value
that
was
apparent
before
it
was
destroyed;
and
two,
whether
or
not
the
defendant
had
a
comparable
means,
a
reasonably
available
alternative.
now,
in
the
instant
case,
the
apparent
value
of
that
evidence
is
contingent
upon
technology,
the
existence
of
the
technology.
in
essence,
the
claim
that
the
respondent
made
to
the
jury
was
that
the
material
gathered
was
exculpatory
because
something
would
not
be
found
within
it.
what
would
be
apparently
exculpatory
is
the
absence
of
something.
in
other
words,
they
have
to
first
analyze
the
substance
and
then,
second,
if
they
get
an
inclusive
result,
they
have
to
use
another
test,
which
they
didn't
have
at
the
time...
was
to
determine
whether--
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
--they
didn't
have...
there's
three
types
of
tests
that
they
could
quantify.
they
did
not
have
the
p-30
test,
which
measures
a
constituent
of
semen,
which
gives
an
estimate
as
to
the
quantity
of
semen.
they
did
not
use
the
acid
phosphatase
test,
which
is
another
measure
of
the
quantity
of--
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
--they
did
not
have
it.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
that's
correct.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
that's
correct.
that's
what
the
police
criminalist
said
they
were...
his
words
were:
"they
were
not
in
practice
in
our
lab.
"
that's
what
he
stated.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
they
went...
they
didn't
have
the
test...
it
was
all
admitted...
the
state's...
what
the
state
had
done
with
the
evidence,
the
test
results
and
what
the
defense
criminalist--
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
--they
had
taken
some
tests.
they
had
looked
on
the
swab.
they
had
done
a
abo
blood
type.
they
looked
under
the
microscope.
on
the
underwear,
they
had
later
done
the
p-30
and
abo
on
that.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
they
couldn't--
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
--yes.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
yes.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
to...
it
was
going
to
be
introduced
by
either
the
state
or
the
defendant.
i
guess
the
state
drew
the
sting
by
introducing--
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
--the
state
basically
drew
the
sting
of
the
attack
upon
this
state's
testing
of
it.
the
defense
was
going
to
raise
this
issue.
so,
these
items
were
brought
in.
they
were
marked
as
exhibits.
they
were
shown
to
the
jury,
and
they
were
testified
to
about.
now,
no
incriminating
evidence
was
gathered
from
them.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
or
from
the
swab.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
there's
two
trials
in
this
case.
so,
the
one
that
resulted
in
conviction
was
the
second
trial.
so,
the
state
introduced
these--
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
--no.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
that's
correct.
no
objections
to
any
of
it.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
yes.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
between
the
first
and
the
second
trial?
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
yes,
justice
o'connor--
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
--yes.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
they
would
have...
it
wouldn't
be
conclusive
was
the
expert's
testimony.
they
could
make
an
estimate
based
upon
the
different
constituents.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
yes.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
it's
because
there's...
there
were
two
samples.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
the
p-30.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
on
the
sexual
assault
kit.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
yes.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
if
there
was
sufficient
quantity
of
semen
present,
to
then
later
use
an
abo
blood
type
test.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
yes.
they
had
already
obtained
that
and
got
an
inclusive
result.
the
abo
blood
type
test
in
the
case
simply
showed
no
blood
type.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
that's
correct.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
yes.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
they
didn't
have
them...
the
p-30
test
at
the
time
of
the
first
trial.
after
the
first
trial,
they
did
the
p-30
test.
they
then...
when
they
get
the
p-30
test,
they
test
the
clothing.
they
don't
test
the
sexual
assault
kit
with
the
p-30
test.
then
we
have
the
second
trial.
that's
what
happened.
so,
in
other
words,
when
i'm
asked
is
there
a
test
that
they
had
that
they
didn't
do,
the
answer
is
yes.
they
had
the
p-30
that
they
didn't
do
on
the
sexual
assault
kit.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
it
was
either
the
police
criminalist
didn't
think
there
was
enough
sample
there...
and
he
did
testify
that
be
didn't
think
that
there
was
enough
there...
or
that
be
could
go
back
and
try,
but
it
was
a
very
small
sample.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
yes.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
that's--
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
--yes.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
yes.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
yes.
the
point
i
think
i'd
like
to
make
here
is
that
the
respondent
did
have
alternative
means
by
which
he
could
establish
this,
and
that
he
did
not
use
the
tests
basically
because
he
had
to
make
a
tactical
choice
about
the
reasonable
doubt
argument.
his
reasonable
doubt
argument
is
there
is
either
not
enough
of
the
sample
there
or
the
true
assailant
was
a
nonsecretor
and
yes,
i'm
exonerated.
if
he
had
used
the
test,
he
may
very
well
have
found
out,
as
it
was
indicated,
that
the
samples
were
too
small
to
be
tested.
that's
the
case.
and
his
reasonable
doubt
argument
to
the
jury'
was
eliminated.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
i
don't--
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
--that's
20
to
25
percent.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
they
did
as
to
one...
they
used
the
test
that
they
had
on
the
sexual
assault
kit,
and
they
neglected
the
underwear.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
yes.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
it
hurts
the
state's
case,
yes.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
yes,
and
they
could--
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
--that's
correct.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
yes.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
and
i'm
not
sure
at
what
time
that
that
happens
because
it's
not
in--
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
--yes.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
yes.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
yes.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
they
were...
the...
yes.
they
were
discussed
in
evidence.
the
clothing
wasn't
actually
admitted
into
evidence.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
yes.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
yes.
and
at
the
time
of
the
first
trial,
the
expert
was
speculating
about
the
clothing,
and
it
was
brought
out
that
the
police
did...
had
obtained
the
underwear.
the
arizona
rule
created
here...
and
it's
on
page
24
of
the
state's
brief...
states:
"that
when
identity
is
in
issue
at
trial
and
police
permit
the
destruction
of
evidence
that
could
eliminate
a
defendant
as
the
perpetrator,
such
loss
is
material
to
the
defense
and
is
a
denial
of
due
process.
"
"dismissal
is
the
appropriate
remedy
unless
the
evidence
is
so
strong
that
a
court
can
say
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
destroyed
evidence
would
not
have
proved
exonerating.
"
now,
what
the
court
did
in
applying
this
test
that
dismissal
is
the
remedy
unless
the
evidence
would
not
have
proved
exonerating
is
simply
to
determine
for
itself
whether
or
not
the
jury
has
properly
reached
its
verdict.
since
the
evidence
wasn't
in
existence
and
it
was
speculation
about
what
it
was,
the
arizona
court
of
appeals
decided
to
determine
whether
or
not
into
the
nature
of
these
tests...
are
that
exonerating...
some
of
them...
is
that
they
simply
examined
de
novo
the
jury's
verdict
on
the
other
items
of
evidence,
the
description,
the
identity.
then,
having
done
that,
the
court
simply
was
not
convinced
by
itself
that
the
respondent
was
not
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
but
that
was
precisely
the
function
of
the
trial
jury
in
this
case.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
i
don't
think
it
is
questionable
under
trombetta
because
i
don't
think
that
there
is
an
obligation
for
the
state
to
test.
what's
at
issue
is
a
right
to
access
the
evidence
on
behalf
of
the
defense...
the
defendant.
in
other
words,
the
police
cannot
destroy
it.
i
don't
think
that
the
police
are
under
an
obligation
to
test
it.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
i
think
there
is
no
due
process
violation.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
yes.
there's
different
samples
involved,
but
the
quick
answer
is
yes.
the--
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
--and
if
i...
if
there
are
no
further
questions
and
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
yes.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
his
reasonable
doubt
argument?
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
yes.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
no,
sir.
test...
yes,
sir.
we
did,
in
fact.
testing
the
swab
under...
for
the
p-30
protein
would
be
a
meaningless
exercise
even
today.
the
police
criminalist,
edward
heller,
testified
that
in
only
about
10
percent
of
the
cases
do
these
rectal
swabs
ever
contain
any
semen
at
all.
in
addition,
he
had
already
tested
it
once
by
a
destructive
test
to
determine
the
presence
or
absence
of
blood
markers,
abo
specifically,
which
of
the
four
major
blood
groups
the
semen
donor
belonged
to.
when
questioned
about
doing
further
testing,
he
said,
"i
suppose
it
would
be
possible.
"
"i
don't
know.
"
but
if
we
were
to
test
it
today,
suppose
that
today
we
performed
the
destructive
p-30
protein
test
and
found
that
on
the
swab
today
there
is
an
adequate
amount
to
test.
that
does
not
tell
us
that
the
amount
removed
from
the
swab
and
tested
in
the
first
place
was
adequate
or
not.
it
would
tell
us
that
we
can
no
longer
perform
any
further
testing
because
we
have
elected
to
do
the
p-30
protein
test
and
have
thereby
destroyed
the
evidence.
had
the
defense
made
the
tactical
decision
to
perform
that
test
and
destroyed
that
last
bit
of
semen,
i
would
expect
that
we
would
be
hearing
today
that
it
is
the
defense's
fault
that
the
evidence
was
not
preserved.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
this
case
isn't
like
brady
v.
maryland
or
united
states
v.
agurs.
if
i
could
make
the
broad
analogy
here.
it's
more
like...
at
least
as
towards
the
underwear,
it
is
more
like
a
case
that
had
really
nothing
like
these
facts,
but
it's
like
united
states
v.
lavasco,
which
is
a
pre-indictment
delay
case.
this
is
where
i'm
looking
for
a
constitutional
analogy.
in
those
cases,
united
states
v.
lavasco,
united
states
v.
marian,
a
defendant
is
basically
claiming
because
of
government
inaction,
delay
basically,
that
inaction
has
resulted
in
my
losing
evidence.
a
witness
has
died
or
something
has
happened.
as
to
his
complaint
about
the
underwear,
it
is
this.
by
the
time
i
was
arrested,
it
was
gone.
analytically
it's
the
same
thing.
he's
saying
because
of
police
inaction,
it
is
gone
by
the
time
of
arrest.
under
that
framework,
in
united
states
v.
lavasco
or
united
states
v.
marian,
this
court
looks
to
the
prejudice
to
the
defendant
and
government
conduct,
whether
or
not
there
was
a
tactical
motive
on
the
part
of
the
police
to
get
a
tactical
advantage
over
the
defendant.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
no.
there's
so
many
different
tests.
there
is
at
least
one
test
that
would
have
eliminated
the
reasonable
doubt
argument,
which
was
the
acid
phosphatase
test,
which
their
expert
said
stayed
stable
over
a
period
of
years.
and,
he
may...
he
probably
has
the
best
point
that
the
identification
test...
the
identification
test,
like
the
abo,
that
would
narrow
down
the
population...
may
very
well
have
been
gone
by
the
time
he
was
arrested.
but
there
is
at
least...
he
could
have
attempted
to
narrow
down
his
argument,
his
argument
about
the
reasonable
doubt
to
the
jury,
by
doing
an
acid
phosphatase
test.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
what
he...
as
to
that
one
piece,
but
there
were
several
pieces
and
he
won't
examine
any
of
them.
and
that
one
evidence
is--
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
yes.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
that's
it.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
it
is
except
it
was
of
importance
here.
when
there
was
no
abo
blood
group
typing,
then
the
claim
is
the
real
assailant
is
a
nonsecretor.
otherwise
it's
not
important.
now,
the
p-30
test
can
come
in
to
tell
you
the
additional
information
that
the...
if
there
was
a
large
amount
of
semen
present,
then
you
do
have
a
nonsecretor.
if
you
have
a
low
amount,
you
don't.
that's
how
it
comes
into
play.
the
characterization
as
to
the
underwear
as
the
better
sample
was
really
speculation.
it's
based
only
upon
the
expert
who
never
saw
it.
and
there
was
evidence
in
the
record,
which
i
need
not
go
into
it.
it
was
just
basically
that
the
victim
washed
up
and
that
the
victim
then
put
his
clothes
back
on
shortly
after
the
crime
and
was
taken
in
a
quick
manner
to
the
hospital.
so,
what
was
or
was
not
on
the
underwear,
without
examining
it,
was
pure
speculation.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
that's
correct.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
that's
correct.
mr.
john
r.
gustafson
yes.
