mr.
mallard,
as
a
matter
of
curiosity,
what
has
happened
to
these
indigents?
has
someone
else
been
appointed
and
carrying
on
for
them?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
is
chief
judge
vietor?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
allen,
one
of
my
present
clerks
is
a
member
of
the
new
jersey
bar.
he
has
just
received
a
request
to
represent
an
indigent
in
new
jersey.
suppose
he
were
a
member
of
the
iowa
bar,
what
is
his...
what
may
he
do
at
this
point?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i'll
give
you
a
better
reason
than
that.
we
have
a
rule
7
here,
a
supreme
court
rule,
which
says
that
no
clerk
shall
practice
law
while
he
is
serving
as
a
clerk.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
i
have
a
suspicion
that
some
of
these
state
judges
might
not
be
influenced
very
much
by
that
kind
of
a
rule.
i
think
i
find
myself
in
a
dilemma.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--that's
a
practice
that's
been
followed
for
some
time,
isn't
it?
