justice
thurgood
marshall
--counsel,
did...
does
the
judge
need
a
statute
to
request
somebody
to
do
something?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
statute
means
more
than
just
request,
doesn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
he
didn't
need
the
statute.
it
was
just
a
wasted
statute.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--the
judge
doesn't
need
the
statute
to
request
anything,
does
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
this
is
wasted
material.
justice
thurgood
marshall
don't
you
have
to
admit
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
doesn't
mean
any
more
than
that
he
can
request,
just
like
he
can
request
the
janitor
to
clean
out
spittoons.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
it
couldn't
mean
anything
more,
then
could
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
just
don't
see
where
you
get
your
rights
under
that
statute.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
allen--
--i
don't
see
why.
--can
i
get
to
the
root
question
that
comes
up
all
the
time?
you
appoint
a
probate
lawyer
to
defend
a
murderer.
is
that...
would
that
be
required
under
this
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--it
seems--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--that
a
similar
statute
applies
to
criminal
cases.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
mean,
the
whole
purpose
is
what
good
is
an
inexperienced
lawyer
to
a
client?
what
good
is
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
would
happen
in
a
case
like
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what...
that
i
happen
to
know
about
when
the
federal
trial
and
the
defense
lawyer
that
was
appointed
had
never
heard
of
the
jenks
act.
i
mean,
what
would
do
with
somebody
like
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
he
told
you...
when
he
was
appointed...
that
he
never
heard
of
the
jenks
act,
you
wouldn't
appoint
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
this
case
this
man
said,
"i
don't
know
about
this
business.
"
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
just
don't
like
the
statute,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
agree--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--with
the
statute
that
it
gives
you
your
freedom.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
your
freedom
is
to
tell
the
court
no.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that's
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
all
you
want?
