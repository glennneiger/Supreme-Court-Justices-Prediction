mr.
john
e.
mallard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
a
federal
court
is
empowered
by
28
u.s.c.
section
1915(d)
to
require
an
unwilling
attorney
to
undertake
a
representation.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
has
effectively
held
that
such
a
power
exists.
this
interpretation
conflicts
and
splits
with
the
decisions
of
the
fifth,
sixth,
seventh,
and
ninth
circuits.
in
nelson
v.
redfield,
the
eighth
circuit
directed
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
iowa,
the
respondent
herein,
to
prepare
a
list
of
attorneys
practicing
in
the
district
who
would
be
available
for
pro
bono
appointments
under
section
1915(d).
the
petitioner
herein,
john
mallard,
was
selected
from
this
list
for
an
appointment.
since
i
am--
mr.
john
e.
mallard
--yes--
mr.
john
e.
mallard
--your
honor.
since
i
am
the
petitioner
herein,
for
ease
of
communication,
i
will
hereafter
use
the
first
person
in
my
presentation
of
this
case.
i
was
admitted
to
the
california
bar
in
1981
and
the
iowa
bar
in
1984.
since
june
of
1984
i
have
been
employed
by
the
law
firm
of
marcus
&
mallard
in
fairfield,
iowa
where
i
have
practiced
primarily
in
the
area
of
corporate
and
securities
law.
in
the
fall
of
1986
our
firm,
which
consisted
of
three
lawyers
at
the
time,
decided
to
take
on
a
fourth
lawyer
who
had
substantial
experience
in
litigation
and
could
develop
a
litigation
practice
within
the
firm.
because
this
lawyer
was
not
yet
in
a
position
to
seek
admission
to
the
southern
district,
i
obtained
admission
so
that
our
firm
could
appear
as
counsel
in
two
cases
in
the
southern
district.
i
had
no
intention
to
undertake
the
responsibility
of
litigating
those
cases.
because
i
appeared
before
the
southern
district,
my
name
was
added
to
a
list
of
attorneys
available
for
pro
bono
service.
in
june
1987
i
was
informed
by
the
volunteer
lawyer's
project
that
i
had
been
appointed
to
represent
the
plaintiffs
in
the
case
of
traman
v.
parkin.
this
case
involved
complaints
by
three
prison
inmates
against
eight
prison
guards
and
administrators
alleging
physical
mistreatment,
that
the
role
of
the
inmates
as
informants
had
been
exposed
to
other
inmates
and
that
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case,
their
lives
had
been
endangered.
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case
were
seeking
both
damages
and
injunctive
relief.
in
june
1987,
several
weeks
after
i
had
reviewed
that
file,
i
filed
a
motion
to
withdraw
on
the
grounds
that
adequate
representation
of
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case
would
require
substantial
discovery
and
extensive
examination
and
cross
examination
of
multiple
parties
and
other
witnesses.
in
my
estimation,
i
was
not
competent
to
provide
the
services
that
would
be
required
for
effective
representation
of
those
parties.
mr.
john
e.
mallard
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
e.
mallard
yes.
both...
the
motion
that
i
made
was
originally
submitted
to
the
magistrate
who
found
that
i
was
competent.
and
then--
mr.
john
e.
mallard
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
mallard
as
an
objective
matter,
the
district
court
has
so
found.
i
think
that,
you
know,
i
had
been
applying
perhaps
a
different
standard,
a
higher
standard
based
on
the
services
that
i
would
like
to
see
provided
and
that
i
believe
that
i
commonly
provide
to
my
other
clients
in
a
business
setting.
i
offered,
in
my
motion,
to
provide
alternative
pro
bono
service,
but
that
offer
was
not
considered
by
the
district
court
as
being
sufficient.
in
connection
with
my
appeal
of
the
ruling
on
competence,
i
also
brought
a
motion
to
the
district
court
on
the
ground
that
1915(d)
did
not
empower
the
district
court
to
require
an
unwilling
attorney
to
undertake
a
representation.
mr.
john
e.
mallard
your
honor,
the
way
i
read
1915(d)
the
answer
is...
is
yes,
that
the
court
has
authority
to
request
an
attorney
to
become
involved
in
the
case.
and
i
believe
that--
mr.
john
e.
mallard
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
that
is
actually...
probably
the
only
point
that
i
am
aware
of
that
is
a
possible
grounds
of
merit
on
the
respondent's
side.
i
think
there
are
at
least
three
answers
or
responses
to
that
question.
and
if
i
might
address
them
in
turn.
i
think
the
respondent
bears
a
heavy
burden
to
show
that
it
could
not
obtain
counsel
by
making
a
request.
just
because
the
first
lawyer
who
is
requested
to
undertake
a
representation
declines,
i
do
not
believe
that
that
is
evidence
that
other
lawyers
who
felt
more
comfortable
with
the
task
would
not
step
forward
upon
request.
i
believe
that
attorneys
have
been
very
giving
of
their
time
and
that
as
a
practical
matter
when
a
litigator
has
developed
a
relationship
with
a
certain
judge
and
receives
a
call
from
that
judge
and
a
request,
that
it
would
be
very
unlikely
that
that
person
would
decline
the
judge's
request.
mr.
john
e.
mallard
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
it's
not
quite
that
new,
although
i
think
my
circumstances
are
more
unusual
in
that
i
had
a
lot
of
discomfort
with
undertaking
those
responsibilities.
i
don't
think
that
requests
are
always
declined.
i
think...
as
an
example
in
this
case,
the
respondent's
counsel,
the
attorney
general
for
the
state
of
iowa,
is
appearing
on
behalf
of
the
southern
district
based
upon
a
request
made
by
that
court.
mr.
john
e.
mallard
your
honor,
i
regret
if
there
is
any
ambiguity
in
my
response,
but
i
think
it's
based
upon
the
usage
of
the
word
appoint.
i
think
certainly
that
the
court
possesses
authority
to
appoint
an
attorney
who...
who
accepts
a
request.
and
to
bestow
him
with
the
power
and
title
and
authority
to
go
forward
and
represent,
you
know,
indigent--
mr.
john
e.
mallard
--your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
that
that
authority
exists
or
was
granted
by
congress
under
1915(d).
mr.
john
e.
mallard
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
mallard
if
it
were
a
criminal
action,
i
believe
the
court
does
possess
the
authority.
i
think
that
congress
has
generally
distinguished
between
the
nature
of
the
legal
rights
and
interests
which
are
involved,
and
even
the
constitution,
in
terms
of--
mr.
john
e.
mallard
--well,
partially,
your
honor.
i
think
yes.
i
think
there
is
really...
if
it's
considered
as
a
continuum,
certainly
on
one
side
with
the
sixth
amendment,
a
right
to
counsel,
rights
where
the
potential
for
heavy
penalties,
severe
penalties,
are
so
great
that
counsel
must
be
provided.
and
i
know
congress
has
enacted
several
statutes
aimed
at
that
effect.
and
certainly
in
the
middle
of
the
continuum
other
statutes
where
congress
has
addressed
rights
that
they
believe
to
be
of
such
importance.
for
example,
being
represented
in
a
contempt
proceeding
or
in
certain
child
custody
proceedings
that
congress
has
spoken
and
said
counsel
should
be
appointed
or
assigned.
and
in
those
other
statutes
used
those
words,
appoint
or
assign.
at
the
final
end
of
the
continuum
where
we
find
section
1915(d),
there
is
no...
it's
all
other
civil
rights
and
cases.
there...
there
is
no
specification
of
rights.
and
consequently
because
congress
could
not
know
how
serious
the
case
might
be
and
how
essential
the
need
for
counsel
would
be,
i
would
submit
that
it
left
it
under
1915(d)
to
the
discretion
of
the
court
to
determine
whether
to
request
an
attorney
to
be
involved,
and
to
the
attorney's
discretion
also--
mr.
john
e.
mallard
--in
accepting.
mr.
john
e.
mallard
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
concede,
yes,
except
perhaps
in
certain
limited
circumstances--
mr.
john
e.
mallard
--to
the
extent
there
would
be
a
constitutional
right
involved
possibly--
mr.
john
e.
mallard
--under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
john
e.
mallard
well,
i
raise
my
constitutional
objections
only
for
the
purpose
that
to
the
extent
this
court
found
the
plain
meaning
of
1915(d)
to
be
unclear
or
ambiguous
and
upon
looking--
mr.
john
e.
mallard
--yes.
mr.
john
e.
mallard
i
think
that
there
would
be
serious
constitutional
claims
if
the
statute
were
construed
in
the
manner
that
the
respondent
suggests,
that
the
word
"request"
should
mean
require.
but,
you're
correct,
your
honor,
in
that
i
did
not
submit
the
constitutional
arguments
as
the
reasons
for
overturning
the
statute.
i
present
them
on
the
grounds
that
this
court
should
construe
the
statute
narrowly
in
order
to
avoid
serious
constitutional
objection.
in
july
1987,
after
my
motion
had
been
refused
and
denied
by
the
district
court,
i
appealed
the
decision
and
sought
appellate
review
to
the
eighth
circuit
by
applying
for
a
writ
of
mandamus.
the
eighth
circuit
denied
my
application
without
issuing
an
opinion.
the
eighth
circuit
did,
however,
stay
the
proceedings
in
the
traman
case,
the
underlying
litigation,
so
that
i
could
seek
appellate
review
to
this
court.
the
holding
of
the
eighth
circuit
should
be
reversed.
1915(d)
provides,
in
relevant
part,
that
the
court
may
request
an
attorney
to
represent
a
person
who
is
unable
to
employ
counsel.
the
plain
meaning
of
the
words
"may
request"
implies
that
an
attorney
may
decline
a
requested
representation.
the
respondent
argues
that
the
use
of
the
word
1915(d)
is
ambiguous,
and,
consequently,
that
the
legislative
history
must
be
examined
for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
intent
of
congress.
but
the
respondent
bears
a
heavy
burden
to
show
that
this
language
has
ambiguity.
there
are
many
cases
which
use
the
words
1915(d).
but,
other
than
the
eighth
circuit,
all
of
the
circuit
courts
which
have
considered
the
meaning
of
a
request
made
to
an
unwilling
attorney
have
concluded
that
the
statutory--
mr.
john
e.
mallard
--language
may
request--
mr.
john
e.
mallard
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
mallard
in
this
instance
i
believe
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
john
e.
mallard
no,
your
honor.
i
believe
if
you
examine
the
historical
context
the
enactment
of
1915(d)
goes
all
the
way
back
to
1892.
and
at
that
time...
and
the
main
purpose
of
that
statute
was
to
open
the
courts
so
that
the
poor
would
have
access.
and
that
was
the
principal
purpose
that
congress
had
in
mind
in
passing
the
act,
and
it's
my
belief
that
since
courts
were
not
commonly
confronted
with
the
question
at
the
time
of
how
did
the
poor
have
counsel,
because
the
poor
were
not
even
allowed
through--
mr.
john
e.
mallard
--the
door--
mr.
john
e.
mallard
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
mallard
it's--
mr.
john
e.
mallard
--well--
mr.
john
e.
mallard
--your
honor,
i
believe
the
answer
is
no.
i--
mr.
john
e.
mallard
--in
my
opinion,
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
e.
mallard
no,
i
don't
believe
congress
intended--
mr.
john
e.
mallard
--i
would
submit
from
the
plain
meaning.
but
perhaps
if
we
look
to
the
legislative
history
and
examined
certain
of
the
points
which
are
instructive
on
the
point
of
legislative
intent,
it
will
provide
further
meaning
to
this
court.
because
i
believe
that
if
this
court
believes
the
words
"may
request"
are
ambiguous
on
their
face,
that
the
intent
can
be
inferred
for
four
reasons.
first,
the
legislative
history
reveals,
as
i
mentioned,
that
the
main
purpose
was
to
open
access
to
the
courts
for
poor
persons.
this
purpose
must
be
distinguished
from
providing
counsel.
the
difference
in
the
treatment
of
these
two
objectives
by
congress
is
apparent
from
the
distinction
in
the
language
which
is
employed
in
sections
1915(c)
and
1915(d).
subsection
(c)
deals
with
officers
of
the
court
such
as
persons
serving
process,
which
was
distinguished
from
attorneys,
and
provides
that
these
persons
shall
issue
and
serve
process.
while
subsection
(d)
provides
only
that
the
court
may
request
an
attorney
to
represent
a
person
unable
to
employ
counsel.
congress
knew
how
to
use
language
which
suggests
an
element
of
compulsion.
it
chose
to
do
it
in
subsection
(c)
and
it
chose
not
to
do
it
in
subsection
(d)
relating
to
attorneys.
as
a
second
point
on
congressional
intent,
it
is
instructive
to
consider
the
manner
in
which
the
language
was
most
likely
chosen.
legislative
history
shows
that
1915(d)
was
inspired
by
certain
state
statutes
in
existence
at
that
time.
in
fact,
there
were
11
such
state
statutes
and
all
of
them
describe
the
power
of
the
court
to
obtain
counsel
by
using
the
words
"appoint"
or
"assign".
however,
while
congress
must
have
been
aware
of
these
state
statutes
and
likely
referred
to
them
as
a
model
for
1915(d),
it
chose
the
words
"may
request"
in
substitution
for
the
words
"appoint"
or
"assign".
mr.
john
e.
mallard
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
it
is
in
the
joint
appendix
and...
it's
in
a
committee
report
by
the
committee
of
the
judiciary,
and
it's
near
the
end
of
the
joint
appendix
where
the
committee
states
or
the
member
of
the
committee
who
was
filing
the
report,
that
the
statute
is
inspired
by
the
humane,
enlightened
laws
of
several
states.
an
historical
study
shows
that
there
were
11
statutes,
in
effect
and,
again,
as
i
mentioned,
they
all
used
the
word
"appoint"
or
"assign".
the
charge
in
that
language
in
1915(d)
was
presumably
made
with
the
intent
to
change
the
meaning
of
the
federal
provision
and
the
degree
of
power
conferred
upon
the
federal
courts.
the
third
argument
supporting
the
proposition
that
congress
intended
1915(d)
to
give
the
courts
authority
to
request
rather
than
require
an
attorney
to
take
a
case
is
that
congress
did
not
provide
for
any
compensation
under
the
statute.
in
contrast
to
this,
federal
statutes
that
expressly
empower
a
court
to
appoint
or
assign
an
attorney
typically
provide
for
compensation.
the
fact
that
congress
did
not
do
so
under
1915(d)
is
further
evidence
that
congress
expected
attorneys
to
appear
as
volunteers
only.
as
a
fourth
and
final
point
on
congressional
intent,
i
would
refer
to
the
response
made
to
justice
o'connor
earlier
with
respect
to
the
different
types
of
legal
interests
involved
which
the
constitution
or
congress
would
have
a
desire
to
protect,
and
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
where
it's
not
possible
to
know
of
the
importance
of
those
rights
in
leaving
it
to
the
discretion
of
the
courts.
mr.
john
e.
mallard
your
honor,
it's
my
understanding
that
an
attorney
who
is
representing
a
person
under
that
statute
who
wants
to
take
depositions
has
to
make
a
motion
or
request
to
the
district
court
identifying
the
need,
and
that
then
if
the
court
approves
it,
that
it
has
some
funds
that
are
available
to
reimburse
that
particular
cost.
mr.
john
e.
mallard
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
mallard
no,
your
honor.
it
sits
in
des
moines,
which
is
approximately
a
two
hour
drive
from
fairfield.
mr.
john
e.
mallard
yes,
your
honor.
and,
in
addition,
i
would
have
to
travel
approximately
an
hour
and
a
half
further
south,
to
fort.
madison,
iowa,
to
represent
the
plaintiffs
because
that's
where--
mr.
john
e.
mallard
--the
iowa
state
penitentiary
is.
mr.
john
e.
mallard
yes,
your
honor.
in
short,
an
analysis
of
legislative
history
and
intent
supports
my
reading
of
1915(d).
the
final
consideration
for
this
court
to
hold
in
my
favor
involves
the
fundamental
principle
that
a
statute
should
be
construed
narrowly
so
as
to
avoid
serious
constitutional
questions.
the
respondent
argues
that
the
word
"request"
should
be
read
broadly
to
mean
"require".
but
such
a
broad
reading
could
render
1915(d)
unconstitutional
under
the
first
and
fifth
amendments
in
accordance
with
the
arguments
set
forth
in
my
brief.
consequently,
this
court
should
resolve
any
doubts
it
has
regarding
the
meaning
of
1915(d)
by
construing
the
statue
narrowly
in
accordance
with
its
commonly-understood
meaning.
in
connection
with
the
argument
that's
made
by
the
respondent
that
the
statute
would
be
rendered
null
or
that
the
district
court's
power
would
be
helplessly
ineffective
if
this
court
were
to
rule
in
my
favor,
again,
i
submit
that
the
system
of
making
requests
does
work
and,
secondly,
that,
as
discussed
earlier,
the
legislative
history
suggests
that
congress
was
not
ultimately
concerned
with
providing
counsel
in
these
cases,
but
had
as
its
main
purpose
the
opening
of
the
courts
to
the
poor
by
waiving
certain
court
fees.
last,
even
if
congress
intended
to
provide
an
assurance
of
representation
under
1915(d)
and
found
that
the
statute
when
construed
in
the
manner
i
advocate
was
ineffective
in
doing
so,
congress
might
correct
this
problem
by
enacting
a
new
statute
which
either
clearly
used
language
of
compulsion
or,
more
likely,
provided
for
compensation
so
that
the
availability
of
counsel
was
not
entirely
dependent
upon
volunteerism.
in
conclusion,
this
court
should
rule
in
my
favor
because
the
word
1915(d)
is
plain
and
clear.
even
if
this
court
were
to
find
some
ambiguity,
the
legislative
history
and
intent
of
congress
supports
a
ruling
in
my
favor
also.
mr.
john
e.
mallard
no,
your
honor.
it's
my
understanding,
though,
the
district
court
has
taken
certain
steps
and
i
believe
asked
the
attorney
general
for
the
state
of
iowa
to
undertake
an
investigation
and
report
regarding
their
safety.
but
their
case
has
been
stayed.
mr.
john
e.
mallard
yes,
your
honor.
finally,
request
does
not
mean
require.
the
eighth
circuit
should
be
reversed.
and
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
save
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
e.
mallard
yes.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
not
a
part
of
the
record
in
the
proceedings
below,
but
i
do
not
know
what
the
jenks
act
is.
i
don't
even
know
how
to
spell
it.
i
don't
know
whether
it's--
mr.
john
e.
mallard
--of
this--
mr.
john
e.
mallard
--nothing.
mr.
john
e.
mallard
nothing.
mr.
john
e.
mallard
your
honor--
mr.
john
e.
mallard
--your
honor,
i
believe
the
skills
are
substantially
different.
i
was
about
to
say--
--you
mean
it's
much
easier
to
come
up
here
than
it
is
to
file
a
1983
case
in
representing
a
prisoner?
the
tasks--
mr.
john
e.
mallard
--skills
are
required
in
both
areas.
but
i
think
the
tasks
are
substantially
different.
i
do
believe
that
i
can
effectively
convey
a
concept,
construe
laws,
and
act
accordingly.
but
the
difference
in
the
proceedings
below
were
that
there
would
be
a
requirement
of
substantial
discovery
where
one
must--
mr.
john
e.
mallard
--confront
witnesses--
mr.
john
e.
mallard
--witnesses
and
be
able
to
elicit
testimony
before
a
jury.
those
types
of
skills,
which
i
think
are
substantially
different.
certainly,
i
didn't
know
anything
more
about
1915(d)
a
year
and
a
half
ago
than
i
know
about
the
jenks
act
today.
but
i
would
find
no
reason
to
decline
a
request
on
that
basis.
i
construe
statutes
in
my
practice
commonly,
and
the
federal
securities
act
and
difficult
statutes.
i
offered
to
provide
alternative
service
and,
again,
did
not
feel
comfortable
in
that
area.
one
other
point
on
the
derivation
of
1915(d).
respondent
has
suggested
that
it
was
derived
from
an
english
statute.
and
it's
true,
i
think,
that
the
state
court
statutes
which
had
been
enacted
prior
to
1915(d)
were
derived
form
that
statute
because
they
used
the
same
language
as
the
statute
of
henry
vii,
appoint
or
assign.
actually,
both
words
appeared
in
the
english
statute.
but
the
english
statute
was
not
in
effect
at
the
time
congress
considered
1915(d).
it
had
been
in
effect
for
almost
four
centuries
but
was
abandoned
in
england
in
1883.
and
the
system
that
was
actually
in
effect
at
that
time
required
a
request.
and
there
is
a
quote
from
a
historical
study
at
page
21
of
my
reply
brief.
i
refer
the
court
to
it.
mr.
john
e.
mallard
your
honor,
i
cannot
recall
the
distinction
made,
but
some
of
the
legal
scholars
who
have
worked
in
the
area
have
suggested
that
the
two
types
of
lawyers,
that
the
one
was
like
a
court
employee
or
closer
to
the
court,
and
that
it
was
that
class
of
attorneys
who
had
to
accept
a
court
request.
mr.
john
e.
mallard
yes,
your
honor.
so
why
congress
chose
to
depart
from
the
state
statutes
and
also
the
english
statute
which
was
no
longer
in
existence
is
difficult
to
know.
but
i
would
like
to
submit
that
there
was
potentially
a
very
serious
constitutional
issue,
or
could
have
been
in
the
minds
of
congress.
prior
to
that
time
three
state
supreme
courts,
including
the
courts
in
iowa,
indiana
and
wisconsin,
had
held
that
there
could
be
a
takings
involved
where
there
was
no
compensation--
mr.
john
e.
mallard
--no,
your
honor.
i
like
it
very
much
in
that
i
construe
it
to
give
me
the
flexibility
to
be
able
to
respond.
or
to...
the
freedom
to
deny
a
request
if
it's
in
an
area
of
service
that
i
don't
feel
capable
of--
mr.
john
e.
mallard
--capable
of
providing.
mr.
john
e.
mallard
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
mallard
yes,
that's
the
way
i
read
1915(d).
mr.
john
e.
mallard
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
mallard
yes.
i
have
no
further
argument
on
rebuttal.
if
there
are
no--
