justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
have
to
have
the...
get
the
authority
from
somewhere.
and
you
say
that
it
lies
in
the...
in
1915
with
the
word
"request".
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
take
it
that
the
position
that
you're...
that
you
disagree
with
is
that
the
judge
has
no
power
under
any
circumstances
to
order
an
attorney
to
serve.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is...
that
is
the
position
on
the
other
side.
the
word
"request"
means
request.
it
doesn't
mean
an
order.
justice
byron
r.
white
and--
justice
byron
r.
white
--so
the
lawyer
doesn't
have
to
show
incompetence
or
that...
or
some
hardship
or
anything
else.
he
just
doesn't
want
to
do
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
"sorry,
judge".
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
if
you're
going
to
reach
those,
then
there
are
a
lot
of
rules
that
would
indicate
that...
that
there
are
many
circumstances
where
the
lawyer
shouldn't
serve.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i--
justice
byron
r.
white
--that's
what
the
rules
say.
justice
byron
r.
white
but--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
way
you
described
it,
the
only
thing
you
said
is
that
the
pauper
mix...
the
request
to
the
judge.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
exactly.
but
then
you
never
told
us
what
the
judge
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
there...
well,
was
there
a
practice
of
forcing
lawyers
to
do
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it...
would
it
have
been...
would
it
have
been
contempt
for
him
not
to
take
the...
or,
just
a
professional
wrong?
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
still
haven't
told
us
then
that
the
english
practice
was
to
force
reluctant
lawyers
to
take
an
appointment.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all
right.
so
you--
--it's
probably
still
the
case.
so,
what's
the
big
deal?
i
mean,
if...
if
this
is
not
going
to
be
problem,
why--
