we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
87-1490,
john
mallard
versus
the
united
states
district
court.
mr.
mallard.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
that--
--mr.
mallard,
your
argument
that
the
statute...
or,
rule
doesn't
vest
the
authority...
i
suppose
however
competent
you
were
it
still
wouldn't
vest
the
authority
when
it
says
appoint...
to
conscript
you
against
your
will.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
really
haven't
answered
justice
o'connor's
question
completely.
she
asked
if
it
was
your
position
that
the
judge
under
this
particular
section
lacks
the
authority
to
appoint
an
unwilling
lawyer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
about
the
authority
to
appoint
someone
like
you
who
declined
the
request?
and
to
in
effect
say
you
must
do
it
even
though
you
refuse?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
this
is
a
civil
action,
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mallard,
you
say
the
legislative
history
shows
this.
are
you
referring
to
a
committee
report
or
a
conference
report?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
see.
does
the
district
court
sit
in
fairfield?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
in
order
to
represent
this
party
you
would
have
had
to
go
from
fairfield
to
des
moines
then?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
fort.
madison--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--on
the
river?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mallard.
mr.
allen,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
i
take
it
you're
not
representing
the
district
court
because
of
your
official
position
as
the
deputy
attorney
general
of
iowa.
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that
could
be
with
a
promissory
note
or
something.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
would
have
been
awfully
easy
for
congress
to
use
the
terms
mr.
mallard
says
were
in
existence
in
the
other
state
statutes
on
which
congress
based
section
1915.
the
fact
it
didn't
suggests
very
arguably
a
conscious
desire
on
the
part
of
congress
to
do
something
different
than
those
state
statute
did.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't...
i
don't
think
that's
necessarily
true.
just
based
on
my
own
practice
before
i
went
on
the
bench,
the
district
judges
in
arizona
used
this
most
of
the...
of
the
complaints
filed
under
section
1915
appeared
to
them
to
have
no
merit.
but
occasionally
they
would
feel
one
might
have
merit.
and
they
used
this
device
to
single
out
those
ones
with
merit
and
get
ahold
of
a
lawyer
and
say,
"look,
i
think
there
might
be
something
to
this.
"
"this
guy
deserves
representation.
"
"so,
under
this,
i
request
you
to
do
it.
"
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--a
mechanism
for
calling
lawyer's
attention
to
a
case
that
a
district
judge
thinks
may
stand
out
among
the
numerous
ifp
filings
that
don't
seem
to
have
merit.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
reading
section
1983
is
maybe
one
sentence.
[laughter]
but
it's
a
by-reference.
it's
the
whole
constitution
and
federal
statute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
the
rules
would
not
be
enforced
by
the
federal
district
court
if...
it
request
means
what
mr.
mallard
says
it
does.
the
fact
that
there
are
rules
in
iowa's
court
of
professional
responsibility
that
might
suggest
an
obligation
would
not,
to
me,
mean
that
the
district
court
could
enforce
it.
that
would
be
up
to
the
iowa
bar,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
we
know
what
the
criminal
statutes,
what
the
criminal
counterpart
says?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
without
pay?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
a
practice--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
your,
mr.
allen.
mr.
mallard,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
mallard.
the
case
is
submitted.
