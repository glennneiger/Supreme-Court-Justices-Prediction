mr.
mallard,--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
just
be
sure
i
understood
something
you
said
earlier.
you
do...
did
i
understand
correctly?
you
concede
that
if
this
were
a
criminal
case,
you
could
be
compelled
against
your
will
to
serve?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--defendant
has
a
constitutional
right.
but
what's
that
got
to
do
with
your
right
to
say
no,
if
you
think
you
have
such
a
right?
i
don't
understand.
your
brief
certainly
didn't
suggest
you...
in
fact,
i
think
if
you
concede
that
you
must
be
giving
up
all
your
constitutional
objections.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
merely
arguing
we
should
avoid
the
constitutional
question
by
construing
the
statute
in
your
favor?
that
you're
not
really--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
you
really
don't
think
you
have
a
constitutional
claim
on
its
own
bottom?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
mallard,
can
i
ask
you,
since
you've
raised
this
matter
of
the
compensation
and
the
like,
what
is
the
practice
in
the
southern
district
of
iowa
in
a
case
of
this
kind
if
you
had
to
take
depositions?
say
you'd
accepted
the
appointment
and
had
to
take
depositions.
would
you
have
to
advance
the
costs
out
of
your
own
pocket
or
is
there
some
provision
for
financing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
so
the
appointment
does
not
contemplate
your
advancing
your
own
funds
for
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
surely
has
got
to
be
a
first
case
for
every
lawyer
in
every
field,
unless
he
works
for
a
giant
law
firm.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
mallard,
may
i
interrupt
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you,
please?
before
you...
this
matter
arose,
how
many
cases
had
you
argued
in
this
court?
how
much
did
you
know
about
our
rules
and
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--certiorari
procedures?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
you
were
competent
to
represent
yourself
in
this
case?
you
must
have.
you
picked
yourself
as
a
lawyer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
had
exactly
the
same
experience
for
this
assignment
as
you
had
for
the
one
down
there
that
you
declined.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
have...
don't
need
any
skills
up
here,
but
you
need
a
lot
of
skills
down
there?
is
that
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
much
harder--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--to
take
a
deposition?
is
that
the
point?
