you
could
admit
it.
he
can
request
it.
but
is
requesting
it
the
same
as
requesting
it
appropriately?
i
can
request
anybody
to
do
all
sorts
of
things,
but
many
of
those
requests
would
be
inappropriate,
wouldn't
they?
but
when
a
statute
says
it,
doesn't
it
mean
more
than
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
may
well
do
something
if
a
general
asked
me
to
do
it
and
i
happened
to
be
a
lieutenant
and
it's
just
put
to
me
as
a
request.
but
it's
another
question
whether
i
can
be
court-martialled
if
i
don't
do
it.
i
may
never
get
a
promotion.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
may
get
pretty
bad
assignments
if
i
don't
comply
with
the
request.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
to
use
request
as
synonymous
with
command
is
just...
i
mean,
words
have
no
meaning
if
one
starts
talking
like
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
give
me
an
example
where
it
was
used
that
way?
not
a
dictionary
definition
of
the
noun,
but
of
a
verb...
the
verb
"request"
used
in
any...
any
literary
example
you
like
where
it's
used
to
mean
command
or
require.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
the
noun.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
the
noun.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
was
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
that
mean?
in
law
a
request
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
or
the
fourth
is
they
had
the
power
but
didn't
want
to
exercise
the
power.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
follow
that
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
request
used
to
be
used
for
something
that
was
made
from
the
other
direction.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
your
explanation
of
why
request
is
used
in
this
statute
is
we're
doing
it
the
other
way
and
therefore
we're
going
to
use
the
same
word.
is
that
it?
the
request
used
to
go
from
the
pauper
to
the
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
congress
used
request
here...
why?
because
they
thought--
justice
antonin
scalia
was
it
an
order
from
the
pauper
to
the
court?
when
the
pauper
made
the
request
to
the
court,
did
the
court
have
to
snap
to
and
do
it
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
--could
the
court...
the
court
could
do
it
or
not
do
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
was
a
request?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
does
that
leave
you?
then
in
reversing
it
i
assume
it's
still
a
request.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
sure
about
that?
there
are
a
lot
of
requests
that
judges
may
makes.
for
example,
i...
would
i
feel...
feel
it
proper
as
a
judge
when
i
have
a
speech
coming
up,
as
a
district
judge,
to
call
up
a
member
of
the
bar
and
say,
"you
know,
mr.
smith,
i
have
this
speech
coming
up.
"
"how
would
you
like
to
give
me
a
hand
writing
this
speech?
"
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
could
make
that
request,
couldn't
i?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
would
be
inappropriate.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
don't
you
think
it
would
be
inappropriate
for
a
district
judge
to
call
one
of
the
counsels
who
comes
before
him
every
day
and
say,
"you
know,
just
as
a
favor
to
me,
how
about
representing
this
fellow?
"
he
could
theoretically
do
it,
but
it
would
be
inappropriate
because
most
requests,
especially
to
the
bar
that
appears
before
the
district
judge
every
day,
will
be
complied
with,
and
it's
a
form
of
coercion.
couldn't
the
statute
be
explained
on
that
basis?
although
ordinarily
it
would
be
inappropriate
for
a
district
judge
to
do
this,
we
say
it's
appropriate.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
appropriate
cases
may
include
only
those
cases
where
no
member
of
the
bar
willing
to
serve
steps
forward.
isn't
that
possible?
that
whatever
inherent
power
there
exists
in
the
court
is
exercisable
against
the
will
of
the
attorney
only
if
none
of
his
fellow
attorneys
is
willing
to
undertake
the
representation.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
the
minimal
inherent
authority
that
a
court
would
need?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
justice
marshall's
attorney
would
say
the
same
thing.
you
know,
jenks
act,
well,
i'll
have
to
look
it
up.
i
mean,
there's
nothing
we
can't
learn.
just
give
us
enough
time.
right.
you're
saying
there's
never
anybody
who
is
not
qualified.
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
he's
uneducable?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
i
really
think
the
judge
in
the
hypothetical
will
say
to
the
lawyer,
"you'd
better
read
the
jenks
act.
"
i
don't
think
he'd
say,
the
fact
you
don't
know
about
the
jenks
act
is
a
sufficient
reason
for
not
appointing
him
because
there's
certainly
a
lot
of
statutes
that
lawyers
are
unfamiliar
with
when
they
first
get
involved
in
a
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
think
most
appointing
judges
do
that.
so,
you'd
better
learn
something
about
those
matters.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
the
iowa
bar
thinks
is
sufficient
inexperience
for
a
lawyer
to
decline
may
be
quite
different
from
what
a
particular
district
judge
thinks.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
he
took
this
case
voluntarily...
a
client
walked
in
with
this
case
and
he
took
it,
he
probably
would
have
been
violating
some
of
the
cannons
in
taking
a
case
for
which
he's
not
competent.
justice
antonin
scalia
who
was
appointed
under
the
english
statute?
were
solicitors
appointed
or
barristers
appointed?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
point
is,
if
it
was
barristers,
there
would
be
no
problem
about
a
lawyer
feeling
himself...
inexpert
in
the
conduct
of
trials.
