sandra
day
o'connor
that's
you.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and,
in
any
event,
the
district
court
found
you
were
competent?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
don't
we
take
it
as
though
you
are
in
fact
competent
to
do
this
work?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
court
have
authority
to
appoint
someone
to
represent
this
indigent
litigant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
everyone
in
the
district
says
no?
they're
all
like
you
and
they
say,
"we
just
don't
want
to
do
it?
"
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
yeah,
i
think
in
my
day
it
would
have
been
unthinkable
to
tell
the
judge
you
wouldn't
do
it.
it
must
be
a
new
era
out
there.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
it
were
a
criminal
action?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
on
the
criminal
side
does
it
rest
on
the
inherent
power
of
the
court?
something
to
do
with
the
sixth
amendment
or
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
have
any
federal
or
state
cases
explicitly
relied
on
inherent
authority
of
a
trial
court
to
appoint
counsel
in
a
civil
case?
have
you
found
any
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
professional
rules
in
the
state
of
iowa
speak
to
that
question
in
any
way?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
though
the
statute
might
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
maybe
the
professional
rules
of
conduct
would--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--require
the
attorney
to--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--do
more
than
just
say,
"i
won't"?
