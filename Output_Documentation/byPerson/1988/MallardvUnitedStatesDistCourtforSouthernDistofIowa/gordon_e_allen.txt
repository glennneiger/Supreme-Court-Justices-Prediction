mr.
gordon
e.
allen
that's
correct,
your
honor.
as
the
footnote
in
the
original
response
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
indicates,
our
office
was
charged
with
representing
the
defendants
in
the
underlying
action
filed
by
mr.
traman
and
others.
we
did
not
participate
at
either
the
district
court
level
in
responding
to
his
original
request
to
withdraw,
nor
did
we
respond
to
the
mandamus
action
filed
in
the
eighth
circuit.
when
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
with
this
court,
chief
judge
vietor
contacted
my
office
and
asked
me...
actually,
he
requested
me--
[laughter]
--and
i
said,
"certainly,
judge,
i'd
be
very
glad
to
do
that.
"
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
i
appear
on
his
behalf
today.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
did
i
think
i
had
a
choice?
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
well,
i
think
in
discussing
the
word
"request"...
and
it's
dealt
with
extensively
in
the
briefs...
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
it
contextually.
one
can
get
a
request
from
a
stranger
on
the
street
which,
as
an
iowan,
i
come
to
washington,
d.c.
and
i
see
a
lot
of
those.
and
i
get
a
certain
feeling
about
what
that
request
means.
if
i
get
a
request
from
a
friend,
i
get
a
somewhat
different
feeling
about
that.
if
i
get
a
request
from
my
spouse,
i
have
somewhat
different
request...
it's
a
somewhat
higher...
in
most
cases
it's
still
negotiable
but
it's
nevertheless
there.
if
i
receive
a
request
from
a
general
in
the
army
or
in
from
a
judge,
that
request
in
its
context
to
me
means
i
am
to
do
it
unless
i
have
extraordinary
reasons
for
not.
and
in
answer
to
your
question,
i
think
the
plan
which
is
imposed
by
the
district
court
provides
that
accommodation
to
mr.
mallard,
both
on
the
front
end
during
the
application
and
appointment
process
where
it
gives
leeway
for
geographical
needs,
it
gives
leeway
for
time
schedules,
it
gives
leeway
for
prior
pro
bono
work.
in
effect
it
makes
a
decision
as
to
whether
mr.
mallard
in
this
particular
case
can
conduct
the
litigation.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
and
i
agree.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
and
i
agree.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
well,
i
think
if
you'll...
i
have
two
answers
to
that.
if
you'll
look
at
the
definition
of
the
usage
of
the
word
1892
when
it
was
used
by
congress,
i
think
most
of
the
dictionaries
that
we
have
cited
indicate
that
the
word
"request"
came
from
the
same
root
word
as
"require"
and
in
some
instances
meant
demand.
congress'
use
of
that
word--
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
--we
did
not
cite
the
literary
examples.
we
cited
the
dictionary
usage.
and--
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
--they
were
verbs.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
of
the
verb
also,
sir.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
well,
not
cited
in
the
brief...
there
is
anderson
cited.
but
not
cited,
your
honor,
is
abbott's
law
dictionary
of
1879
which
specifically
says...
quote...
in
law
a
request
is
substantially
equivalent
to
a
demand...
close
quote.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
in
law?
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
correct.
i
think...
the
word,
i
think...
and
this
all
goes
to
mr.
mallard's
specific
request,
specific
statement
here
that
this
statute
is
not
ambiguous.
i
think
it
is
ambiguous.
the
use
of
the
word
1892,
the
use
of
the
word
"request"
in
the
context
of
current
usage
i
think
is
ambiguous.
i
think
the
split
in
the
circuits
and
the
very
split
within
the
circuits
of
the
decisions
that
they
have
handled
indicates
to
those
courts
and
to
this
court
that
the
usage
of
the
word
mr.
mallard
would
suggest
that
it
is.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
that's
mr.
mallard's
argument.
and
if
you
look
at
it
very
carefully,
it
is
exactly
the
opposite.
for
instance,
if
we
look
at
the
legislative
history
and
it's
silent
upon
what
they
meant
by
the
word
"request"
or
why
they
chose
request,
we
come
up
with
three
options.
either
congress
believed
that
they
had
the
power
to
order
and
therefore
the
word
"request"
did
not
need
any
comment,
it
just
meant
we're
going
to
order
it.
or
that
attorneys
historically
and
traditionally
had
responded
to
the
judge's
request
and
therefore
we
need
not
explain
it.
or
the
third
option
is
that
we
did
not
have
the
power,
congress
did
not
have
the
power.
so,
the
usage
of
the
word
"request"
has
no
meaning,
we
need
not
comment
on
it
in
legislative
history.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
but
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
legislative
history.
for
four
hundred
years
the
henry
vii
statute
had
provided
that
paupers
in
england
could
by
the
signing
of
an
affidavit
of
poverty
and
an
affidavit
of
merit
by
two
attorneys
then
the
pauper
could
go
to
the
court
and
request
an
attorney.
eleven
states
had
followed
that
history
and
had
used
the
word
"appoint".
congress,
in
my
view,
looked
at
the
word
400
years
of
history
where
in
the
pauper
had
to
go
to
the
court
and
make
the
request,
and
said,
no,
we're
going
to
order
in
the
first
three
sections
of
1915(d)...
we're
going
to
order
the
court
officers
to
serve
without
pay.
in
the
fourth
section,
subsection
(d),
we're
going
to
turn
that
request
around.
we
are,
first
of
all,
going
to
eliminate
the
affidavit
necessary
to
be
filed
by
two
counsel
of
the
bar
that
this
case
has
merit.
we're
going
to
eliminate
that.
we're
going
to
eliminate
the
request
from
the
pauper
to
the
court
and
we're
going
to
turn
it
around
and
we're
going
to
give
the
court
the
power
to
request
of
the
pauper
a
request
of
the
attorney
for
service
to
that
case.
in
other
words,
the
use
of
the
word
"request"
was
directed
to
the
court.
and,
in
fact,
a
subsection
of
the
statute
specifically
goes
to
the
court
may
request.
in
answer
to
the
question
by
justice
marshall,
the
statutory
construction
requires
that
we
give
some
meaning
to--
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
--fine.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
correct.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
correct.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
because
we're
changing
the
request
flowing
from
the
pauper
to
the
court
and
we're
flowing
from
the
court
to
the
attorney.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
we're
placing
the
onus
of
responsibility
on
the--
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
--no.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
of
course.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
of
course.
similar
to
the
question--
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
--it
is
a
request.
that
is
the
word
they
chose.
and
that
takes
us
then
to
justice
marshall's
position.
if
the
court
and
if
the
statutory
intent
of
this
statute
is
to
open
the
doors
and
provide
greater
access
to
the
pauper,
then
if
we
construe
the
statute
that
it
is
merely
a
request
and
it
does
nothing
more
than
what
the
court
could
do
without
the
statute,
and
if
the
attorney,
unwilling
as
they
are
in
some
instances,
and
i
think
because
of
the
imposition
of
this
plan
in
1986
demonstrates
are
certainly
to
the
great
extent
unwilling
in
the
southern
district,
but
for
a
few,
four
percent
as
referenced
in
the
briefs...
if
we
give
the
attorneys
the
option
of
saying
no,
i'm
not
going
to
do
it,
and
if
we
create
a
statute
which
gives
to
the
court
something
that
they
had
already
and
really
didn't
need
the
statute,
then
the
statute
becomes
meaningless.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
and
that's
essentially
the
same
plan
that
is
in
operation--
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
--in
the
southern
district.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
and
that
is
essentially
the
same
plan
that's
in
operation
in
the
southern
district.
i
think,
as
justice
marshall
suggests,
the
court
would
have
the
power
to
do
that
irrespective
of
whether
the
statute
were
passed.
i--
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
--are
you
asking
me
if
you
would
feel
it
proper--
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
--you
could--
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
--yes.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
well,
as
i
started
to
answer
to
your
question
a
while
ago,
the
plan
in
the
southern
district
of
iowa
provides
for
an
accommodation
on
the
front
end.
and
in
answer
to
your
specific
question
of
inappropriate
request,
it
answers
that
accommodation
need
at
the
other
end.
the
suggestion
of
the
respondent
and
of
the
district
court
before
you
is
that
the
proper
way
to
review
this
decision,
this
exercise
of
discretion
by
the
district
court,
is
under
the
standard
of
abuse
of
discretion.
it
is
not
to
declare
that
the
statute
means
that
the
district
court
cannot
ask
this
question
of
an
unwilling
attorney.
it
is
not
to
suggest
that
the
district
court
does
not
have
the
power.
but
it
is
to
review
that
decision
as
a
discretionary
judge
decision
and
then
review
it
on
the
standard
of
abuse.
if
mr.
mallard
comes
to
the
district
court
and
demonstrates,
as
the
record
reflects
he
did
not
in
this
case...
demonstrates
his
incompetence,
demonstrates
that
he
has
a
high
case
load
and
is
unable
to
take
the
case
at
this
time,
demonstrates
a
conflict
of
interest,
or,
in
your
suggested
example,
demonstrates
that
the
request
is
inappropriate...
he
doesn't
need
to
write
the
speech...
then
he
reviews
that.
it
is
then
appealable
on
the
standard
of
abuse
of
discretion,
and
the
judge's
decision
of
making
that
inappropriate
request,
for
whatever
reason...
either
as
you
suggest
or
as
mr.
mallard
might
suggest
to
the
district
court...
that
then
that
decision
is
then
reviewed
under
that
standard.
it
is
not,
however,
to
suggest
that
1915(d)
is
either
a
violation
of
the
statutory
rights
of
this
particular
attorney,
or,
as
he
more
appropriately
and
perhaps
more
dangerously
says
in
his
brief,
is
unconstitutional.
what
mr.
mallard
is
here
before
you
today
saying
is
that
the
literal
reading
of
1915(d)...
if
you
don't
read
it
literally,
which
i
suggest
the
legislative
history
provides
that
we
need
not...
but
if
you
don't
read
it
literally,
you
cause
constitutional
problems
with
his
appointment.
that
causes
a
broad
pattern
of
difficulty
because
i
would
suggest
that
there
is
very
little
difference
between
the
appointment...
albeit,
the
statute
says
appoint...
of
an
individual
attorney
to
represent
a
criminal
defendant
on
an
unwilling
basis
than
there
is
representing
a
civil
case.
now,
the
argument
might
flow
that
in
the
sixth
amendment
rights
of
counsel
the
government
has
an
obligation
to
provide
that
counsel,
and,
therefore,
the
governmental
obligation
can
be
transferred
over
to
the
attorney
and
the
attorney
nevertheless
has
to
comply
even
though
unwilling.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
what
he
would
do...
would
do
was...
as
mr.
mallard
had
done.
and
that
is
go
to
the
district
court,
first
to
the
magistrate
and
then
to
chief
judge
vietor,
and
indicate
that
this
particular
request
was
inappropriate
because
he
lives
here
in
washington,
d.c.
and
would
be
unable
to
geographically
represent
this
defendant.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
then
judge
vietor
would--
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
--i
would
suggest
that
chief
judge
vietor
would
honor
rule
7
and
he
would
not
appoint
your
law
clerk
to
any
case.
and
if
he
did,
i
would
suggest
that
an
appeal
to
the
eighth
circuit
for
mandamus
would
lie
and
the
eighth
circuit
would
certainly
honor
rule
7.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
you
could
request
him
to
withdraw
the
appointment.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
my
bottom
line
is
that
the
judge--
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
--i
believe
it
lies
in
1915(d).
i
also
believe
that
1915(d)
is
a
recognition
of
the
inherent
power
of
the
court.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
i
have
not
found
any
that
have
said
specifically,
"we
rely
upon
inherent
power".
however,
the
case
which
mr.
mallard
specifically
cites,
that
is,
united
states
v.
30.49
acres
of
land,
that
case
specifically
reviews
the
eighth
circuit's
decision
that
yes,
they
have
the
power,
and
said,
no,
you
don't.
however,
in
footnote
16
in
land
they
specifically
say
this
decision
is
construing
1915(d)
and
it
specifically
does
not
say
anything
about
the
inherent
power
of
the
court,
which
may
lie
in
certain
appropriate
cases
for
the
appointment
of
an
attorney
in
a
civil
case.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
that's
the--
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
--that...
that
is
certainly
the
minimal
power.
i
would
suggest
that
in
most
cases
it
would
certainly
more
than
that.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
well,
this
statute
applies,
your
honor,
only
to
civil
cases.
i
know,
but--
so
it
would
not
appoint--
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
--to
murderers.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
the
criminal
justice
act--
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
--applies
to
criminal
cases.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
that's
been
in
existence
since
1790,
by
the
way.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
well,
the
inexperienced,
incompetent
attorney
in
that
particular
case,
i
concede,
is
not
good
for
that
client.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
in
a
case
like
that
the
individual
attorney...
be
it
mr.
mallard
or
others...
would
go
to
the
court
and
say,
"i'm
a
probate
lawyer,
i
cannot
handle
a
murder.
"
we'll
use
your
example.
the
resources
which
the
plan
makes
available...
and,
again,
that's
cited
in
the
brief...
makes
co-counsel
available.
in
extraordinary
cases
where
the
probate
attorney
is
to
defend
the
murderer
and
is
absolutely
incompetent,
withdrawal
is
permitted.
if
mr.
mallard
had
sufficiently
demonstrated
to
judge
vietor
that
he
was
in
fact
incompetent,
then
his
withdrawal
would
have
been
allowed.
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
the
briefs
he
filed
in
both
the
district
court
and
the
circuit
court,
and
in
this
court,
and
his
presentation
today
demonstrates,
as
it
did
to
judge
vietor,
that
he's
not
an
incompetent
lawyer.
he
may
have
to
study
1983,
but
he's
not
incompetent.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
what
would
i,
as
the
judge,
do?
i
would
allow
withdrawal.
[laughter]
as
a
discretionary
act
under
the
statute,
i
would
allow
withdrawal.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
probably
not.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
no.
what
he
said
is
and
his
affidavit
is
that
"i
don't
remember
much
about
it.
"
"i'd
have
to
study.
"
he
did...
instead
of
saying,
"i've
never
heard
of
the
jenks
act.
"
he
said,
"i
know
about
1983.
"
"i'd
just
have
to
read
about
it.
"
i
would
suggest
that
that's
not
a
standard
of
incompetency,
forcing
an
attorney
to
read
a
book.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
no,
i'm
not,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
no.
i'm
not...
certainly
not
saying
that.
what
i
am
saying
it
is,
that
if
the
extraordinary
circumstance
is
demonstrated
such
that
the
discretionary
act
of
the
judge
should
be
exercised,
then
the
judge
will
either
refuse
to
appoint
or,
subsequent
to
the
appointment
if
incompetency
is
demonstrated,
exercise
discretion
by
appointing
co-counsel
or
by
ultimately
allowing
withdrawal.
the
plan
allows
for
that.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
at
the
first
instance
i--
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
--at
the
first
instance
i
would
suggest
that
he
would
say
what
judge
vietor
said
to
mr.
mallard,
read
section
1983.
if
after
reading
it,
he
demonstrated
no
proficiency
whatsoever,
then
withdrawal
might
be--
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
--i
understand
that.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
i
adamantly
disagree
with
that.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
i
adamantly--
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
--disagree.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
all
he
need
do
under
mr.
mallard's
hypothesis
to...
is
to
express
unwillingness.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
"sorry,
judge,
i'm
busy.
"
he
doesn't
even
have
to
say,
"i'm
busy".
he
just
says,
"sorry,
judge".
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
i
believe
they
do.
and
our
brief
did
indicate
that
we
believe--
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
--yes.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
well,
we--
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
--read
the
rules
to--
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
--yes.
we
read
the
rules
in
iowa
to
require
the
individual
ethical
obligation
of
the
attorney
to
be
imposed
upon
that
attorney.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
and
then
the
system
helps
them
out.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
and
that,
again,
is
mr.
mallard's
position.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
mr.
mallard--
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
--and
i
read
the
same
rules--
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
--he
suggests
that
if
he
reads
the
rules
and
determines
that
he
is
incompetent,
or
for
whatever
reason,
he
cannot
serve,
then
his
say
goes.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
can
go
to
the
judge
and
say,
"as
i
read
the
rules,
i
should
not
serve.
"
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
correct.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
oh,
absolutely.
an
administrative
disciplinary
action
against
mr.
mallard
for
handling
an
action
for
which
he
was
incompetent
would
be
judged
by,
i
think,
a
different
standard
than
judge
vietor
applied
in
the
initial
determination.
and
i
say
initial
determination
because
i
think
the
exercise
of
the
judge's
discretion
throughout
the
case
is
exercised
continually.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
no.
as
demonstrated
by
this
record,
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
which
proves
in
any
way
that
mr.
mallard
is
incompetent
to
handle
this
case.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
i
agree.
what
mr.
mallard
is
attempting
to
do
by
his
reading
of
the
statute
is
call
into
question
not
only
the
appointment
in
the
civil
context
but
the
appointment
in
the
criminal
context
as
well
because
if
in
fact
the
court
has
no
authority
to
appoint
an
unwilling
attorney,
albeit
if
the
word
is
request
or
appoint,
that
calls
into
question
the
very
authority
of
the
court
to
utilize
an
unwilling
attorney
to
further
the
sixth
amendment
obligation
of
the
government
to
provide
right
to
counsel.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
the
criminal
counterparts
since
1790
has
said
appoint.
it
has
provided
that
without
compensation,
however,
up
until
1964
when
the
criminal
justice
act
was
passed.
so,
from
1790
until
1964
district
courts
were
presumed
to
have
the
authority
to
appoint
attorneys...
albeit
the
word
"appoint"
was
utilized
in
the
statute...
to
represent,
even
though
unwilling...
to
represent
defendants
in
criminal
court.
and
there
was
no--
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
--without
pay.
up
until
1964.
in
answer
to
the
question
issued
by
you,
justice
stevens,
all
costs
are
paid
for
by
this
plan.
not
only
deposition,
but
transportation
costs.
geographical
modifications
are
made
during
the
initial
appointment.
for
instance,
judge
vietor
would
not
appoint
a
northwest
iowa
attorney
to
represent
an
inmate
at
fort
madison.
and,
in
fact,
by
another
local
custom...
this
is
not
in
the
record,
but
let
me
in
answer
to
your
question...
most
of
the
trials
of
the
fort
madison
inmates
are
held
at
fort
madison.
the
district
court
goes
down
to
fort
madison.
so
that
mr.
mallard
would
be
within
about
60
miles
of
not
only
his
client
and
all
the
investigation,
but
also
the
trial.
transportation,
lodging--
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
--would
be
paid.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
some
time.
that's
been
in
existence
at
the
request
of
not
only
the
attorney
general
but
the
department
of
corrections,
that
we
have
our
trials
down
there
to
forgo
transporting
inmates
all
over
the
state.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
the
british
experience
is
approximately
400
years,
as
i
was
discussing
with
justice
scalia,
for
400
years
the
british
provided
that
we
appointed
counsel.
however,
they
did
it--
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
--files
an
affidavit
of
poverty--
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
--the
judge
would
normally
appoint
counsel.
having
an
affidavit
of
merit--
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
--well,--
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
--well,
it
was
deemed
to
be
a
professional
obligation.
but
the
difficulty
in
determining
how
it
was
to
be
applied
was
because
the
affidavit
from
the
two
attorneys
that
the
case
had
merit
would
go
to
the
judge
along
with
the
request
for
appointment
of
counsel.
and,
do
and
behold,
the
judge
would
turn
around
and
appoint
one
of
the
two
counsel
who
signed
the
affidavit--
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
--of
merit.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
i
think
in
the
british
tradition,
it
is
essentially
the
same
as
the
iowa
tradition.
there
were
so
few
lawyers
who
said
no.
it's
difficult
to
determine
whether
it
was
compulsory
or
not.
mr.
gordon
e.
allen
well,
it
is
going
to
be
a
problem
if...
if
you
look
at
how
this
plan
originated.
the
plan
originated
on
a
voluntary
basis
through
the
volunteer
lawyer's
project
whereby
attorneys
signed
up
to
augment
the
services
of
legal
services
corporation.
eight
hundred
lawyers
volunteered
in
the
southern
district,
and
in
1988
they
closed
1,432
cases.
there
was
an
absolute
certainty
that
you
would
get
a
case
on
referral
from
legal
services.
those
800
hundred
cases,
the
district
court
felt,
were...
those
800
attorneys...
it
was
unfair
to
require
them
or
to
request
them
to
service
also
the
many,
many,
many
federal
cases
that
we
had
in
the
civil.
so,
they
augmented
the
plan
by
saying
we're
going
to
have
3,500
attorneys
who
have
participated
in
federal
court
and
are
members
of
that
bar
and
have
consented,
through
their
oath.
that
way,
based
upon
the
appointment
process,
you
will
only
get
a
case
once
every
seven
or
eight
or
nine
years.
mr.
mallard
opted
not
to
sign
up
for
the
volunteer
lawyer's
project
whereby
appointment
would
be
almost
a
certainty.
he
then
put
his
name
in
the
barrel
because
he
got
into
the
federal
bar.
and
got...
when
his
name
was
pulled
he
said,
after
having
played
the
numbers
game
and
his
number
came
up,
"ah,
wait
a
minute.
"
"now
i'll
go
back
to
the
volunteer
lawyer's
project.
"
"i
want
another
bite
at
the
exemption
apple.
"
so
to
speak.
had
he
signed
up
for
that
originally,
he
would
not
have
been
requested
to
take
a
federal
case.
and,
as
he
suggested
here,
he
would
have
been
allowed
to
do
bankruptcy
and
creditor's
rights
because
the
checksheet
says...
when
you
fill
out
for
volunteer
lawyer's
project
what
kind
of
cases
would
you
like.
he
could
have
taken
the
case
that
he
wanted.
he
opted
not
to
do
that
and
went
into
the
federal
plan.
what
is
at
stake
today
i
think
is
really
the
perception
of
justice.
it's
really,
as
1915(d)
was
to
address,
it
was
to
address
opening
the
doors
to
the
pauper.
it
was...
it
is,
i
would
submit,
in
furtherance
of
the
lawyer's
ethical
obligation.
as
i
come
into
this
court,
i
am
always...
as
i
walk
under
the
portico
and
it
says
equal
justice
under
law,
and
i'm
allowed
to
walk
past
the
line
and
i
don't
have
to
stand
out
with
the
public.
and
then
i'm
allowed
to
sit
in
front
of
the
bar.
and
then,
more
particularly,
i'm
allowed
to
stand
up
here
and
for
a
minimal
period
of
time
i'm
allowed
to
participate
in
history.
that,
to
me,
is
an
awesome
obligation.
it
is
an
awesome
privilege.
with
those
privileges
and
with
those
obligations
comes,
i
think,
the
responsibility
that
when
the
court
requests,
i
answer.
that
i
am
a
partner
in
the
administration
of
justice,
and
that
contrary
to
what
i
think
mr.
mallard
is
positing
to
this
court
the
law
is
more
than
a
business,
it
is
a
profession.
i
think
that
judge
vietor
had
the
authority
to
ask
mr.
mallard,
and
absent
those
extraordinary
circumstances
which
the
plan
would
allow
mr.
mallard
to
demonstrate
in
order
to
allow
him
to
withdraw,
i
think
his
appointment
should
have
stayed,
and
i
think
the
eighth
circuit
was
correct
in
saying
so.
thank
you.
