justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
answer
justice
scalia's
question
by
saying,
oh,
they're
beneficiaries
of
past
discrimination,
and
thereby
solve
the
problem
by
claiming
that
they
are
somehow
the
beneficiaries
of
a
particular
kind
of
benefit,
but
that
seems
to
me
precisely
the
kind
of
thing
that
ought
to
be
tried.
if
your
answer
to
the
question,
well,
why
shouldn't
they
get
their
day
in
court,
is,
oh
well,
because
they
are
in
a
special
class,
it
seems
to
me
that's
precisely
what
they
want
to
try.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
say
that
because
of
their
attorney,
or
were
these...
each
of
these
persons
represented
by
this
attorney
in
1974?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
were
most
members
of
the
fire
department
members
of
the
union?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
your--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
your
view,
was
it
appropriate
for
the
trial
court
to
deny
the
motion
to
intervene
at
the
fairness
hearing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
day
after?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
it
the
day
after?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
in
your
view
that's
a
proper
order?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
the
duty
to
intervene
arises
at
some
time
before
the
fairness
hearing
begins?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
trying
to
fix
the
point
at
which
a
firefighter,
say,
who
comes
into
the
fire
department,
for
six
months
or
so,
and
hears
about
a
lawsuit,
suddenly
has
to
go
join
it.
when...
when
does
he
have
to
join
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
under
your
view,
i,
i
suppose
many
of
us
would
be...
have
our
interests
affected
by
lawsuits
and
we'd
have
to
read
the
newspapers
every
day
to
see
what
lawsuits
have
been
filed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
have
any
statistics
on
how
many
employment
actions
were
filed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
that
same
period?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
merely
because
an
action
is
filed
doesn't
mean
that
a
consent
decree
is
going
to
follow.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
fact,
i
would
speculate...
and
it's
sheer
speculation...
that
it's
probably
a
factor
of
something
like
50
to
one.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
isn't
it
a
corollary
to
that
that
if
your
rule
is
adopted,
interested
employees
would
have
to
join
each
of
the
49
suits
on
the
grounds
that
they
might
lead
to
a
consent
decree?
that's
just
the
flip
side
of
the
coin,
isn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
a
class
action?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
during
the
period
'74-'77,
were
there
any
employment
suits
brought
against
the
city
other
than
this
one
that
involved
this
department?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--when...
when
would
it
have
become
clear
that
the
fire
department
was
implicated
in
the
suit?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
