justice
john
paul
stevens
the
people
that
justice
scalia
just
referred
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
were
any
of
the
white
firemen
charged
with
violating
the
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
was
relief
requested
against
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
fitzpatrick,
can
i
ask
a
kind
of
basic
question
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
instead
of
a
settlement
this
case
had
been
tried,
and
there
were
findings
of
fact
of
discrimination,
and
then
the
court
made
it
clear
that
after
appropriate
hearings
and
plenty
of
time
to
study
it,
the
court
was
going
to
enter
a
remedial
decree
that
would
affect
whites
as
well
as
blacks.
and
then
you
had
a
chance
to
come
in
and
you
did
exactly
what
happened
here
right
on
the
eve
of
it,
you
either
did
or
did
not
intervene.
would
that
make
any
difference
whether
it
was
a
litigated
decree
or
a
consent
decree?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
might
go
to
whether
he'd
grant
relief
or
not.
but
say
he
granted
just
relief
that's
way
off
the
wall,
he
just
said
no
whites
can
ever
be
hired
here
for
the
next
six
years,
or
something
like
that,
wouldn't
you
have
the
same
standing...
pardon
me?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
just...
i'm
just...
really
i'm
trying
to
get,
with
what
i'm
trying
to
think
through
is
whether
the
fact
that
it's
a
consent
decree
has
any
bearing
one
way
or
another
on
your
right
to
say,
i
want
to
attack
that
decree
because
i
wasn't
a
party
to
it,
and
i'm
not
bound
by
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
really,
the
question
isn't
whether
your
clients
are
bound
by
the
decree,
the
question
is
whether
the
decree
is
a
defense
to
the
litigation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
in
that
connection--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
of
course,
it
may
or
may
not
be,
but
you
at
least,
you
have
standing
to
say
it's
an
invalid
decree;
it
might
have
been
entered
fraudulently
or
all
sorts
of
reasons.
but
you're
just
claiming...
at
this
point
all
you
want
is
standing
to
challenge
it,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you're
not
just
asking
for
standing,
you're
asking
us
to
rule
on
what
the
standards
should
be
on
deciding
whether
the
decree
is
valid,
is
a
defense
of
the
litigation--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--right.
and
you
say
that's
the
same
whether
it's
a
consent
decree
or
litigated
decree?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
and,
of
course,
then
the
merits
would
also
be
the
same
whether
it's
a
consent
decree
or
litigated
decree?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
you're
not
asserting
necessarily,
and
it's
not
before
us
here,
whether
the
city
might
not
have
some
sort
of
defense
to
certain
kinds
of
relief,
if
it
was
acting
in
reliance
upon
the
judicial
decree.
i
suppose
you
would
categorically
say
that
the
city
cannot
keep
doing
the
bad
thing,
but...
but
whether
it's
liable
to
damages
for
the
past
doing
of
it
might
be
a
different
question,
no?
justice
john
paul
stevens
surely
for
that
purpose,
to
go
back
to
justice
stevens'
line
of
questioning,
there
would
be
a
difference
between
a
consent
decree
and
simply
a
court
determination,
because
there
the
city
wouldn't
be
the
architect
of
its
own
violation,
if
it
was...
if
it
was
simply
hit
with
a
judgment
that
required
it
to
do
certain
things.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
of
course,
you
assume
the
party
settling
a
case
is
an
architect
of
the
settlement.
sometimes
he
has
to
negotiate
with
his
adversaries.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
claiming
it
was
a
collusive
settlement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
have
been
eager
to
settle
lawsuits
once
they
get
the
evidence
before
the
judge.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
right
out
the
outset,
mr.
merrill,
because
i'd
be
interested
in
your
views.
we
use
the
word
"bound"
by
the
decree.
in
your
judgment
does
that
mean
the
same
thing
as
whether
the
decree
could
constitute
a
defense
to
a
title
vii
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
quite
a
different
issue
than
whether
the
outsiders
are
bound
by
the
decree.
they're
not
affirmatively
obligated
to
do
anything
as
parties
to
the
decree.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they're
not
bound,
they're
just...
there's
a
defense
to
their
lawsuit
out
there,
which
is
in
the
fact
that
the
city
has
relied
on
a
decree.
and
i
suppose
the
defense,
as
one
of
the
other
lawyers
suggested,
is
precisely
the
same
whether
it's
a
litigated
decree
or
a
consent
decree,
as
long
as
it's
a
bona
fide
judicial
decree.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
we're
really
not...
and
the
question
really
isn't
whether
they're
bound,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
they
can
challenge
the
decree
in
order
to
anticipate,
to
defeat
this
defense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
merrill,
i
thought
we'd
agreed
these
parties
aren't
bound.
there's
no
question
of
being
bound
by
the
decree.
it's
a
question
of
whether
this
is
a
defense
to
their
lawsuit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it's
quite...
it's
quite
a
different...
i
mean,
it's
a
shorthand,
but
you're
mixing
up
two
very
fundamentally
different
concepts.
because
there's
no
requirement
that
somebody
get
notice
if
they
want...
well,
there's
a
big
difference
between
being
bound
and
just
wanting
to
bring
a
lawsuit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
see,
and
that's
part
of
the
confusion
with
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
they
sometimes
use
the
word
"bound"
and
then
at
the
end
they
ask
whether
the
decree
can
be
used
as
a
defense.
and
they're
very
different
concepts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
let
me
ask
you
a
question.
supposing
that
your
opponents
wanted
to
attack
this
decree
as
having
been
fraudulently
entered
into,
that
there
was
a
bribe
changed
hand
or
something
like
that,
you'd
agree
there
was
standing
to
do
that,
wouldn't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
really
isn't
a
question
of
standing
at
all
or
a
question
of
being
bound,
it's
a
question
of
whether
it's
a
good
defense,
a
particular
decree.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
it's
not
just
a
matter
of
relitigation.
maybe
they
have
a
higher
burden.
but
even
if...
you
would
say
that
under
no
circumstances,
if
there
had
been
no
hearing,
no
matter
how
wild
the
decree
was,
that
they
couldn't
say
that
this
decree
violates
some
standard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
maybe
the
fact
that
there
was
a
hearing
and
notice
is
a
defense
to
their
claim
rather
than
one
that
stops
them
at
the
threshold.
