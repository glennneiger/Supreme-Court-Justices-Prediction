justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
the
district
court
held
that
the
plaintiff's
claims
were
impermissible
collateral
attacks--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--on
the
consent
decrees.
i
mean,
that
was
my
understanding
of
the
ruling.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
to
the
extent
that
he,
the
judge,
determined
they
were
impermissible
attacks.
i
guess
that's
the
issue
we
have
here,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
mean,
it's
entirely
possible,
if
not
likely,
that
the
respondents
would
lose
on
the
merits,
if
their
claims
were
ever
heard.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i
guess
that's
not
our
concern
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
fitzpatrick,
this...
this
litigation
involved
promotion
practices
of
the
city,
i
take
it.
what
we're
dealing--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--yes,
the
original
action
involved
hiring.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
who
has
to
be
joined
in
your
view
in
a
hiring
suit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
who
has
to
be
joined,
in
your
view,
in
a
hiring
action?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
just
people
on
the
eligibility
list.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
were
these
respondents
members
of
that
association?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
merrill,
the
federal
government
supported
the
entry
of
the
consent
decree
in
this
case.
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
indeed,
it
might
constitute
a
valid
defense
if
suit
were
permitted
by
the
respondents.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
relates
to
what
justice
stevens
was
just
asking.
suppose
these
respondents
are
allowed
now
to
file
their
suit
and
be
heard,
i
assume
the
government
might
think
the
defense
is
valid,
that
the
consent
decree
provides
a
valid
defense.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
who
do
you
think
has
to
be
named
in
a
hiring
suit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
what
should
the
rule
be?
how
would
you
apply
rule
19
in
this
context?
