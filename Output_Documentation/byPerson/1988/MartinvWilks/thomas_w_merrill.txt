mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioners
maintain
that
respondents
are
bound
by
a
consent
decree
that
was
entered
in
a
case
in
which
they
were
not
parties,
in
which
they
were
not
in
privy
with
any
party.
that
proposition
is,
to
say
the
least,
striking.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
justice
stevens,
i
think
that
the
way
in
which
the
issue
should
properly
arise
in
the
lawsuits
that
respondents
have
filed
would
be
framed
in
terms
of
the
mcdonnell
douglas
and
burdine
standard
that
this
court
has
laid
out.
the
respondents
would
have
to
show...
establish
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination,
then
i
assume
that
the
city
would
impose
the
decree
as
a
defense.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
and
at
that
point,
the
answer
to
that
defense
would
be
that
the
decree
is
either
unlawful
or
else
that
the
city
is
acting
outside
the
terms
of
the
decree
and
that
the
decree
is
no
defense--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--no,
they're
not
bound
to
do
anything
under
the
decree,
but
they
are
bound
in
a
collateral...
the
petitioners
claim
is
that
of
collateral
estoppel.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
i
would
agree
with
that,
justice
stevens.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
it's
an
issue
of
res
judicata
or
collateral
estoppel,
if
you
will,
as
to
whether
or
not
the
validity
of
the
decree
is
something
as
to
which
the
respondents
are
collaterally
estopped
from
attacking.
now,
a
litigated
decree
would
be
different,
i
think,
in
that
it
would
have
some
stare
decisis
effect,
at
least
in
the
northern
district
of
alabama.
but
in
either
case,
whether
it's
litigated
or
consent
decree,
our
position
would
be
that
there
can
be...
collateral
estoppel
cannot
be
imposed
on
someone
who
is
not
a
party
or
not
privy
to
the
case
in
which
the
decree
was
entered.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
that's
correct.
we
did.
and
we
have
not
subsequently
sought
to
attack
the
decree,
at
least
as
the
decree
is
written
on
its
face.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
i
don't
follow
your
question.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
the
government
is
obligated
by
the
terms
of
the
decree
to
defend
the
decree...
excuse
me,
defend
the
decree,
and
we
would
not
take
the
position
that
the
decree
itself
is
invalid.
i
don't
think
it's
open
to
us
to
take
that
position,
as
signatories
to
the
consent
decree.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
well,
that
raises
an
important
point
that
i
did
want
to
address,
justice
o'connor.
the
case
has
been
argued
this
morning,
i
think,
on
an
implicit
assumption
that
it's
an
unqualified
good
thing
to
try
to
get
everybody
who
has
any
type
of
interest,
however
remotely
affected,
involved
in
one
piece
of
litigation,
and
therefore
that
the
relevant
choices
are
this
mandatory
intervention
rule
or
some
kind
of
mandatory
joinder
rule.
i
think
that
that
assumption
is
open
to
very
serious
question.
i
would
caution
the
court
against
endorsing
some
kind
of
rule
of
even
mandatory
joinder,
let
alone
mandatory
intervention
in
handling
title
vii
disputes.
at
the
outset...
you
can
think
about
the
possibilities,
the
contingencies
that
face
someone
like...
like
the
individual
respondents
at
the
outset
of
a
lawsuit
of
this
nature.
it's
not
clear
whether
or
not
the
plaintiffs,
the
original
plaintiffs
that
is,
will
prevail.
if
they
do
prevail
it's
not
clear
what
type
of
relief
will
be
ordered.
if
there's
a
consent
decree,
it's
not
clear
that
the
consent
decree
is
necessarily
going
to
include
numerical
relief
of
the
nature
that
it
did
here.
even
if
the
consent
decree
contains
that
type
of
relief,
it's
not
particularly
clear
whether
any
of
the
respondents
will
seek
promotions
or
be
eligible
for
promotions,
and
it's
not
clear
if
they
seek
promotions
whether
they'll
be
promoted
or
not
be
promoted.
and
finally,
even
if
they're
not
promoted,
it's
not
clear
that
they
would
feel
sufficiently
aggrieved
by
that
decision
to
want
to
file
a
lawsuit.
and
i
think
the
court
should
be
cautious
about
endorsing
any
type
of
rule
that
sort
of
forces
title
vii
cases
to
consider
non-right,
if
you
will,
contentions
as
a
necessary
requirement
of
litigating
those
particular
lawsuits.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
well,
i
think
rule
19
comes
to
bear
by...
comes
into
play
by
its
terms.
when
you
reach
a
point
where
there
are
identifiable
parties
who
are...
who
have
a
significant
risk
that
they
will
be
adversely
affected
by
the
particular
case.
at
that
point
in
time,
then,
rule
19
requires
that
those
parties
be
joined.
i
think...
i
think
there's
an
important
distinction
here
between
parties
who
have
a
cause
of
action
and
parties
who
don't
have
a
cause
of
action.
the
respondents
in
this
particular
case
at
the
time
of
their
consent
decree
did
not
even
have
a
cause
of
action,
because
they
had
not
been
denied
promotions.
and
i
think
that
someone
who
doesn't
even
have
a
cause
of
action
is
probably
not
the
type
of
person
as
to
which
there
should
be
some
mandatory
rule
of
joinder,
let
alone
mandatory
intervention.
and
i
think
that's
the
basis
on
which,
for
example,
the
penn
central
case
can
be
distinguished.
in
the
penn
central
case
you
had
somebody
who
not
only
had
a
cause
of
action
but
who
had
gone
so
far
as
to
file
a
lawsuit.
it
was
in
a
different
court.
and
then
they
sat
by
while
all
the
other
parties
went
ahead
and
adjudicated
their
claims
in
a
different
court.
that's
a
far
different
situation
than
what
you
have
here,
where
the
claim
is
that
someone
who's
bound...
someone
who
doesn't
even
have
a
matured
cause
of
action
is
bound
by
a
consent
decree
entered
into
somebody
else's
case.
the
fundamental
point
here,
and
i
think
it's
one
that
the
petitioners
have
consistently
glossed
over,
is
that
given
the
strong
background
of
due
process
that
suggests
that
a
party
cannot
be
bound
to
a
case
in
which
they're
not
a
party...
a
person
can't
be
bound
in
a
case
when
they're
not
a
party,
not
privy...
one
would
expect
if
there
was
to
be
an
exception
to
that
that
you
would
find
it
in
a
statute
of
congress
or
in
one
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
and
provisions,
for
example,
regarding
notice--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--well,
i'm
using
that
as
a
shorthand
for
whether
or
not
collateral
estoppel
applies--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--well,
if
the
issue...
technically
you're
right.
the
issue
is
collateral
estoppel,
and
excuse
me
if
i've--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--the
issue
is
whether
or
not
the
decree
is
a
defense
as
to
which
these
respondents
have
nothing
to
say
in
response.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
i
think
the
issue
here
is
collateral
estoppel,
and
i
think
the
issue
is
an
important
one,
justice
scalia.
let
me
just
say
something
very
quickly
about
the
notice
issue,
because
i
think
the
petitioners'
proposition
that
somehow
the
intervene
or
be
bound
rule
satisfies
due
process
glosses
over
some
very
important
points.
first
of
all,
this
court
has
held
in
mullane
and
related
cases
not
that
subjective
knowledge
is
required
but
that
reasonable
means
must
be
undertaken
in
order
to
assure
actual
knowledge.
and
no
claim
can
be
made
that
reasonable
means
in
the
mullane
sense
were
undertaken
here
in
order
to
provide
notice
to
these
particular
respondents.
there
was
publication
notice
in
the
newspaper;
the
publication
notice
didn't
mention
the
fact
that
promotions
were
at
issue.
it
did
not
mention
the
fact
that
there
were
a
numerical...
numerical
relief
was
contemplated
by
the
consent
decree.
furthermore,
one
would
think
that
under
the
intervene
or
be
bound
rule
that
the
relevant
thing
that
the
respondents
would
have
to
have
notice
of
was
the
fact
that
if
they
don't
intervene
they
will...
excuse
me,
be
subject
to
their
collateral
estoppel...
would
be
subject
to
a
collateral
estoppel
contention
or
that
they
will
be
unable
to
attack
the
terms
of
the
consent
decree.
and
there
was
never
any
suggestion
that
that
type
of
notice
was
provided
to
the
individual
respondents
in
this
particular
case.
i
think
it's...
one
instructive
way
to
think
about
this
proposed
rule,
this
collateral
attack
rule,
is
to
compare
it
to
the
class
action
procedures
of
rule
23.
petitioners'
argument
would
in
effect
transform
a
class
action,
title
vii
class
action,
into
a
double
class
action.
not
only
would
you
have
the
named
and
defined
class
that
receives
all
the
procedural
protections
of
rule
23,
but
in
addition
you
would
have
an
undefined
class
with
no
representative
party
representing
that
class,
no
inquiry
into
the
adequacy
of
representation,
and
none
of
the
other
protections
of
notice
by
rule
23.
and
that
class
would
nevertheless
also
be
subject...
or
would
be
unable
in
the
future,
to
collaterally
attack
certain
provisions
of
the
case
that
were
entered
into.
thank
you.
