it's
more
than
just
that
promotions
are
no
longer
the
exclusive
preserve
of
whites,
it's...
it's
that
a
certain
number
of
blacks
have
to
be
favored
under
the
consent
decree,
and
that
a
white
is
not
entitled
to
a
promotion
simply
by
reason
of
his
color,
under
the
consent
decree.
and,
and
you
don't
think
that's
the
kind
of
thing
that
requires
that
the
individual
had
a
chance
to...
in
the
case
that
he's
appeared
in
have
a
chance
to
refute
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
fine,
but
you
could
have
joined
them.
i
mean,
the
usual
rule
is,
if
you
want
to
take
away
something
from
somebody
you
join
them
in
a
lawsuit.
you're
saying
that
you
can
take
it
away
from
them
unless
they
take
the
initiative
and
join
the
lawsuit.
that's
two
contradictory--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
how
you
would
distinguish
this
from
our
other
cases,
that
these
people
are
beneficiaries
of
past
discrimination?
justice
antonin
scalia
that...
that's
been
adjudicated...
has
that
been
adjudicated
as
to
each
of
these
individual--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
we're
talking
about
individual
rights
that
are
being
affected
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
talking
about
a
rule
that
has
to
apply
to
a
lot
of
cases,
however,
and
you're
urging
upon
us,
in
the
interest
of
judicial
efficiency,
that
we
have
to
get
into,
on
a
case
by
case
basis,
this,
it
seems
to
me,
very
difficult
issue
of
whether
a
person
has
had
sufficient
notice
that
his
or
her
rights
are
about
to
be
affected,
whereas
the
opposite
rule,
which
has
been
our
traditional
rule,
is
quite
simply,
if
you
want
to
cut
off
somebody's
rights,
join
them
in
the
lawsuit.
you
don't
have
to
go
into
a
lot
of
inquiry
about
how
much
notice
somebody
had,
when
did
he
have
the
notice,
and
so
forth.
you
want
to
affect
them?
join
them.
mr.
alexander,
were
these
people
charged
with
any
violations
of
law,
or
was
any
relief
sought
against
any
of
them?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
that...
that
joinder
would
only
be
necessary
in
those
massive
numbers
of
cases
that
you
say
where
the
relief
ultimately
desired
is
the
extraordinary
relief
of
race
conscious
relief.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
all
of
the
other
cases,
if
there's
not
going
to
be
any
race
conscious
relief,
there'd
be
no
need
of
joinder.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
it
that
they
were
alerted
to?
i
mean,
if
i
know
that
a
is
suing
b,
and
that
the
subject
of
the
suit
is,
a
is
saying
that
b
should
take
some
money
out
of
my
pocket
and
give
it
to
a,
then
i
might
have
notice
that...
that
i
should
join
that
suit.
but
if
all
i
know
is
that
a
is
suing
b
and
some
subject
of
the
suit
may
somehow
remotely
affect
me,
that's
something
different.
now,
what
did
these
people
know?
all
they
knew
is
that
there
was
litigation
going
on,
a
possible
settlement
in
question,
that
might
affect
their
rights.
did
they
know
for
sure
that
their
rights
were
going
to
be
affected
by
a
race
conscious
remedy
at
the
time
when
you
say
they
should
have
intervened?
justice
antonin
scalia
potential
adverse
effect.
i'm
talking
about
an
individual
white
fireman
who
knows
the
suit
is
going
on,
does
he
have
clear
notice
at
that
point
that
what
you're
talking
about
here
is
preventing
you
from
being
promoted?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
fitzpatrick,
coming
back
to
your
earlier
answer,
that
your
clients
did
not
know
of
the
fact
that
promotions
were
at
issue
in
this
litigation.
is
that
a
matter
of
record
or
is
this
just
your
personal
assurance
today?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
isn't
it
your
legal
position,
mr.
fitzpatrick,
but
even
if
they
knew
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference,
because
they
didn't
have
any
duty
to
act
unless
they
were
served
with
process?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
not
all
you
insist
upon,
not
just
notice,
not
just
notice
that
there's
this
lawsuit
pending.
you
want
them
joined.
i
mean,
notice
that
you
are
hereby
going
to
be
bound
by
the
result
of
this
suit,
unless...
unless
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
it's
that
big
a
difference,
mr.
merrill?
i
mean,
if
two
people
are
litigating
over
which
of
the
two
of
them
owns
my
house,
i
guess
i
am
not
bound
by
that
in
the
sense
that
it
doesn't
make
me
do
anything
if
it
comes
out
wrong.
but
i'd
feel
pretty
bad
if
i
were
if
i
were
obliged
to
live
by
whatever
the
outcome
is.
don't
you
think
there's
a
substantial
difference
between
whether
i'm
bound
in
the
sense
that
i
have
to
do
something
or
whether
i'm
just
bound
in
the
sense
that
whatever
the
court
says
is
the
law
as
to
be.
xxx
if
i
were
you.
