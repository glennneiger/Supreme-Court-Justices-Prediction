mr.
james
p.
alexander
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioners
divide
their
argument
this
morning.
i
will
address
the
facts
and
circumstances
why
respondents,
in
fairness
and
equity,
are
precluded
from
relitigating
the
validity
of
consent
decrees
providing
race
conscious
relief
entered
after
seven
years
of
contested
litigation.
respondents
are
precluded
for
two
reasons.
first,
they
knowingly
sat
on
the
by...
sidelines
of
this
litigation
for
seven
years
without
either
intervening
or
otherwise
claiming
an
interest
in
the
case.
thereafter,
they
were
afforded
an
opportunity
at
a
fairness
hearing
to
contest
the
issue
of
race
conscious
relief,
and
they
had
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
do
so
on
that
occasion.
we
argue
for
the
following
rule
in
the
nature
of
collateral
estoppel
where
the
lawfulness
of
remedial
race
relief
has
been
determined,
where
non-minority
employees
have
had
a
meaningful
opportunity
to
participate
in
that
determination,
then
they
cannot
thereafter
repeatedly
relitigate
that
issue
in
separate
cases.
we
believe
that
the
rule
we
propose
adequately
accommodates
the
interest
of
non-parties;
conserves
judicial
resources;
and
certainly,
in
title
vii
litigation,
provides
an
opportunity
for
the
prompt
settlement
that
congress
has
mandated
where
possible.
no
better
illustration
of
the
difficulties
of
a
contrary
role
exists
than
this
very
case.
in
accepting
the
invitation
of
the
united
states
to
settle
this
case
in
1981,
the
city
of
birmingham,
alabama,
agreed
to
comprehensive
consent
decrees
to
conclude
seven
years
of
litigation.
in
terminating--
mr.
james
p.
alexander
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
the
people
who
sought
to
intervene--
mr.
james
p.
alexander
--they
had
not,
your
honor.
mr.
james
p.
alexander
certainly
at
the
time
the
litigation
was
filed
by
the
united
states,
the
united
states
didn't
name...
they
certainly
did
not
have
the
view
that
they
were
necessary
or
indispensable
parties
for
purposes
of
providing
relief
under
rule
19.
thereafter,
we
were
aware,
of
course,
that
the
same
individuals
who
subsequently
did
try
to
intervene
unsuccessfully
at
a
later
point
were
interested
in
the
litigation
from
the
outset,
participated
certainly
by
consulting
with
our
co-defendant,
the
personnel
board,
through
a
period
of
two
trials,
one
in
1976,
one
in
1979,
without
ever
intervening.
mr.
james
p.
alexander
well--
mr.
james
p.
alexander
--i'm
suggesting
that
case
was
decided
under
the
old
rule
and
may
not
be
fully
applicable
now.
certainly--
mr.
james
p.
alexander
--well,
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that...
that
in
the
penn-central
case,
this
court
with
respect
to
the
burough
of
moosic
clearly
determined
that
they
had
an
obligation
to
intervene
in
the
pending
litigation
in
new
york.
and
when
they
failed
to
do
so,
they
were
precluded,
and
we
think
properly
so,
from
relitigating
issues
that
were
fairly
subject
to
litigation
in
the
earlier
case.
mr.
james
p.
alexander
well,
your
honor,
i
think
they're
perhaps
closer
than
you
may
think.
this
has
been
a
complicated
case.
certainly
we
don't
say
we're
the
penn-central
merger.
but
there
are
a
lot
of
competing
interests,
and
over
2,500
white
employees
in
the
city
of
birmingham.
under
rule
19
as
we
read
it,
certainly
we
don't
fall
under
clause
(1),
and
i
think
the
reason
we
don't
fall
under
clause
(1)
is
we're
not
performing
a
contract.
complete
relief
could
have
been
afforded
without
the
participation
of
the
white
employees.
clause
(2),
as
i
read
it--
mr.
james
p.
alexander
--yes,
sir.
and,
and,
and,
your
honor,
in
the
words
of
the
court's
opinion
in
local
93,
the
consent
decree
to
which
the
city
agreed
at
the
invitation
of
the
united
states
imposed
no
obligation
or
duty
on
the
white
respondents.
mr.
james
p.
alexander
certainly
to
the
extent
that
promotions
in
the
city
of
birmingham
were
no
longer
the
exclusive
preserve
of
whites,
their
interests
were
implicated.
i
think
that
under
the
provisions
of
rule
24
they
would
have
been
in
a
position
to
try
to
have
that
interest
protected.
mr.
james
p.
alexander
i
think,
your
honor,
if
he
elects
to
contest
his
interest,
he
has
an
avenue
under
rule
24
to
do
so.
i
think
there
are
many
white
employees
who
recognize
the
somewhat
egregious
history
in
my
city,
take
the
position
that
some
remedial
relief
is
appropriate
to
deal
with
us.
in
the
city
of
birmingham,
alabama--
mr.
james
p.
alexander
--respectfully,
your
honor,
if
they
are
the
beneficiaries
of
past
discrimination,
as
i
believe
them
fairly
to
be,
i
don't
know
of
any
of
the
cases
of
this
court
that
say
they
must
be
joined
as
a
party
in
the
action.
mr.
james
p.
alexander
certainly
they
are.
i
don't
know
that
that's
the
only
distinction
and
i'm
not--
mr.
james
p.
alexander
--not
as
to
each
of
these
individuals,
but
justice
scalia--
mr.
james
p.
alexander
--we
are,
but
we're
talking
about
it
in
an
incredibly
unusual
situation.
this
case
experienced
an
adversarial
trial
in
1976.
the
trial
court
concluded
that
the
entry-level
test
discriminated
against
black
candidates
for
both
police
and
fire.
race
conscious
relief
was
afforded
on
that
occasion.
thereafter,
that
relief
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
cert
to
that
court
was
denied.
a
second
trial
was
had
in
1979.
at
that
trial,
promotional
practices
were
in
issue,
practices
varying
across
the
city
of
birmingham's
various
departments.
there
simply
was
an
egregious
history
of
discrimination.
mr.
james
p.
alexander
justice
kennedy,
they
could
have
had
their
day
in
court.
they
were
interested
from
the
outset,
there
were
no
blacks
in
supervisory
positions--
mr.
james
p.
alexander
--no,
your
honor,
i
cannot
say
that.
i
do
say
that
each
of
the
respondents
in
the
wilks
case
were
members
of
the
bfa.
the
bfa
began
monitoring
this
litigation
in
1974
on
an
active
basis.
surely
any--
mr.
james
p.
alexander
--most
white
members
of
the
fire
department
were
members
of
the
bfa.
mr.
james
p.
alexander
the
bfa--
mr.
james
p.
alexander
--your
honor,
that...
the
motion
to
intervene
was
made
after
the
conclusion
of
the
fairness
hearing,
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
james
p.
alexander
in
the
second
instance--
mr.
james
p.
alexander
--the
day
after.
and...
and
it
was,
in
fact,
denied
at
the
time
the
court
approved
the
relief
in
question.
mr.
james
p.
alexander
in
my
view,
your
honor,
that
is
a
proper
order.
i
would
call
your
attention--
mr.
james
p.
alexander
--two
responses.
one,
in
the
eleventh
circuit,
the
mclucas
case,
takes
the
position
that
it
could
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
not
to
permit
intervention
prior
to
that
time.
item
two,
the
trial
court
determined
that
intervention
was
untimely.
that
particular
decision
was
appealed
to
the
eleventh
circuit,
which
agreed
with
the
decision
of
the
trial
court,
and
cert
was
not
sought.
mr.
james
p.
alexander
i
think
he
must
go
as
soon
as
he
believes
that
his
interest
is
implicated.
i
think
that
that...
the
facts
in
that
calculus
will
necessarily
vary
from
case
to
case.
mr.
james
p.
alexander
certainly
if
your
union,
your
honor,
is
following
a
case,
actively
working
with
one
party,
making
a
report
to
its
membership,
and
if
you're
in
birmingham,
alabama,
where
many
of
our
institutions
have
been
restructured
over
the
past
20
years,
it
is
not
a
leap
of
faith
to
understand
that
when
you
are
in
a
fire
department
with
no
black
firemen,
as
was
the
case
prior
to
1968,
that
a
federal
court
may
well,
whether
by
consent
or
by
litigated
judgment,
impose
goals
to
remedy
the
effects
of
past
discrimination,
as
we
believe
was
done
properly
here.
mr.
james
p.
alexander
when
you
say
these
people,
your
honor--
mr.
james
p.
alexander
--the--
mr.
james
p.
alexander
--no,
sir.
mr.
james
p.
alexander
relief
has
not
been
requested
against
the
white
firemen
in
any
case.
mr.
james
p.
alexander
if
i
may
respond,
justice
scalia,
to
your
question
or
comment,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
alternative
of
the
rule
we
propose
is
simply
a
sanctioning
of
the
sandbagging
that
occurred
in
this
very
case.
it
is
not
in
the
interests
of
white
employees,
i
suppose
ever,
to
share
their
promotional
benefits
and
rights
with
blacks.
they
can
sit
on
the
sidelines
knowing
that
they
can
bring
a
collateral
attack,
knowing
that
they
can
in
effect
interfere
with
the
process,
and
leave
the
city
in
a
position
where
it
cannot
undertake
to
remedy
what
is
clearly
a
very
serious
legal
problem
in
terms
of
its
own
operations.
mr.
james
p.
alexander
yes,
sir.
i
did
not
send
out
the
invitations
to
the
dance.
i
was
invited
by
the
united
states.
they
sued
me
in
the
first
instance;
they
proposed
that
i
settle.
they
never
suggested
anything
else.
thank
you.
