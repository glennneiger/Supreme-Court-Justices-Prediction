mr.
robert
d.
joffe
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
make
three
points
today.
first,
due
process
does
not
require
allowing
respondents
a
separate
proceeding
to
attack
the
decree.
second,
the
wilks
respondents
should
have
intervened.
joinder
is
not
required
for
finality.
and
third,
they
did
in
fact
have
their
collateral
attack
below.
this
court
has
held
in
a
series
of
cases
from
weber
to
johnson
that,
in
appropriate
situations,
affirmative
action
is
lawful.
the
issue
today
is
when
those
determinations
are
final.
we
argued
for
a
rule
that
allows
for
closure
once
there
has
been
judicial
determination
and
a
meaningful
opportunity
to
participate.
under
respondent's
rule,
that
would
not
happen.
for
example,
in
the
two
years
prior
to
july
of
1987,
there
were
654
consent
decrees
entered
in
employment
civil
rights
cases.
that
doesn't
count
litigated
decrees.
everyone,
or
virtually
every
one
of
those
decrees
would
be
subject
to
attack
by
white
employees
who
were
not
joined
in
those
cases,
let
alone
the
hundreds
of
cases
that
occurred
before
then.
mr.
robert
d.
joffe
i
don't,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
joffe
the
654
is
the
number
that
resulted
in
consent
decrees.
in
addition,
there
were
others--
mr.
robert
d.
joffe
--no,
your
honor.
but
those
600--
mr.
robert
d.
joffe
--well,
if
the
rule
that
respondents
urged
was
adopted
in
those
other
49
cases
for
each
of
the
one,
massive
numbers
of
whites
would
have
to
joined
as
parties,
and
all
the
problems
of
joinder,
which
i
hope
to
get
into,
would
be
added
to
those
other
thousands
and
thousands
of
cases.
mr.
robert
d.
joffe
i
think
the
problems
of
intervention
are
far
less
than
the
problems
of
joinder.
let
me
turn
to
that.
mr.
robert
d.
joffe
i
think
in
most--
mr.
robert
d.
joffe
--i
think
in
most
of
those
employment
civil
rights
cases,
there
is
race
conscious
relief,
your
honor.
i
think,
the
point
is
that,
when
you
have
intervention,
only
one
person
need
intervene.
and
unless
the
others
sitting
on
the
sidelines
think
that
person
isn't
doing
an
adequate
job
they
don't
have
to
came
into
the
litigation.
the
problems
of
joinder
are
enormous.
first
there's
the
question
who
to
sue.
if
you're
going
to
sue
all
the
white
employees
in
the
city
of
birmingham,
who
do
you
name
as
their
representative?
some
of
the
whites
don't
want
to
be
in
the
litigation
because
they
have
no
objection
to
the
result.
of
the...
of
the
whites
who
wish
to
object
to
the
result,
they're
going
to
throw
up
every
procedural
hurdle
you
can
imagine.
they're
going
to
say
the
representative
is
inadequate;
they're
going
to
drag
their
feet.
unless
this
court
holds
that
non-opt
out
defendant
classes
can
be
allowed
in
this
case,
people
will
opt
out,
and
you
won't
have
the
result.
what
essentially
has
been
going
on
in
this
case
for
14
years,
the
record
and
procedural
history
indicate,
is
guerilla...
something
between
guerilla
warfare
and
massive
resistance
to
affirmative
action
in
birmingham.
this
is
not
a
case
where
people
were
unaware
of
what
was
going
on.
in
response
to
chief
justice
rehnquist's
question
about
the
chase
case,
in
chase
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
mortgagee
knew
that
the
case
against
the
mortgager
was
proceeding.
in
this
situation,
it's
far
different.
this
was
a
well-publicized
suit--
mr.
robert
d.
joffe
--well,
i
think,
your
honor,
there
may
be
three
points
to
make
in
response
to
that.
first,
i
think
this
record
demonstrates
notice,
and
in
the
szukhent
case--
mr.
robert
d.
joffe
--well,
knowledge...
knowledge
forms
the
prerequisite
in
estoppel
cases,
or
waiver
cases.
essentially
this
is
an
application
of
the
equitable
doctrine
of
waiver.
mr.
robert
d.
joffe
your
honor,
the--
mr.
robert
d.
joffe
--i
can't.
but
in
this
case
relief
was
not
granted
against
the
whites.
they
were
adversely
affected,
but
there
are
many
cases
where
one
can
be
adversely
affected.
the
penn
central
case
is
one
example,
the
provident
tradesmens
case
shows
that
is
not
unique.
there
are
other
cases
where
people
are
affected
by
a
decision.
and
if
they
fail
to
intervene,
they
can't
later
say
that
they
didn't
have
the
opportunity.
it
is
the
opportunity
to
be
heard
which
due
process
requires,
not
actually
the
hearing.
mr.
robert
d.
joffe
we're
not
urging
that
people
must
alert
themselves.
we're
saying,
on
the
facts
of
cases
like
this,
the
people
were
alerted.
and
that's
the
difference.
mr.
robert
d.
joffe
the
eleventh
circuit
said,
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
772
to
773,
that
the
bfa
knew
of
the
litigation
and
its
potential
adverse
effect
from
the
time
it
was
commenced
in
1974.
mr.
robert
d.
joffe
in
1977,
your
honor,
in
this...
in
that
proceeding,
the
court
entered
race
conscious
relief.
he
issued
an
order
against
the
city
which
resulted
in
white
firemen
for
the
first
time
having
a
real
number
of
blacks
in
the
fire
department.
there
was
then
a
second
trial
at
which
evidence
of
promotional
discrimination
was
entered.
it
defies
imagination
to
believe
that
the
white
firemen,
who
were
fighting
this
affirmative
action
tooth
and
nail,
which
the
bfa
was
doing,
didn't
know
that
they
were
potentially
adversely
affected.
and
the
proof
of
the
pudding
is
they
came
in
and
they
objected
to
the
consent
decree.
they
made
every
objection
to
that
consent
decree
at
the
fairness
hearing
that
they
make
now.
they
filed
their
briefs
in
timely
fashion
under
the
notice
of
the
applications.
they
just
did
not
intervene
in
timely
fashion.
we're
urging
for
a
rule
that
gets
people
to
make
their
objections
at
one
time,
and
not
save
them
for
later.
in
the
words
of
this
court,
in
wainwright
v.
sykes,
paraphrasing
this
court
in
wainwright
v.
sykes,
the
fairness
hearing
should
be
the
main
event,
not
a
tryout
on
the
road.
and
that
is
what
we
are
urging.
otherwise,
all
the
existing
decrees
will
be
opened
up,
and
in
future
cases
all
the
procedural
tangles
of
massive
joinder
against
defendant
classes
will
take
place.
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
fact
that
in
this
case
they
did
have
their
collateral
attack,
in
this
very
case
below.
the
judge
said,
he
was
going
to
try
the
issue
of
prior
discrimination,
prior
to
the
hearing.
they
argued
in
their
pre-trial
brief
that
the
decrees
were
illegal.
mr.
robert
d.
joffe
yes,
in
this
case,
in
this
title
vii
case
which
they
brought,
they
were
parties.
they
argued
that
the
decrees
were
illegal,
they
put
in
all
the
evidence
that
they
wanted
on
trammeling.
the
judge
didn't
deny
any
of
their
evidence.
they
argued
in
summation
that
the
decrees
were
illegal.
mr.
robert
d.
joffe
the
judge
let
them
put
in
whatever
they
wanted.
there
was
no
ruling
of
excluding
any
evidence
on
the
issue
of
trammeling--
mr.
robert
d.
joffe
--he
had
made
several
decisions.
one
is
that
the
city
was
not
compelled
to...
i'm
sorry,
that
the
city
was
compelled
under
the
decree
to
hire
and
promote
blacks,
but
second,
he
found
the
decree
lawful
under
weber.
he
made
five
findings
that
i
refer
the
court
to.
at
85(a)
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
at
page
12,
he
said
they
have
demonstrated
no
facts
demonstrating
that
the
previous
conclusions
of
the
court
were
in
error.
paragraph
13,
he
says,
there
was
serious
underrepresentation
of
blacks.
paragraph
14,
he
says,
the
whites'
rights
were
not
trammeled.
paragraph
151
of
page
106,
he
said,
under
all
the
relevant
case
law
of
the
eleventh
circuit
and
the
supreme
court,
the
decree
is
a
proper
remedial
device.
in
their
appeal
to
the
eleventh
circuit,
they
argued
the
decrees
were
illegal.
never
until
this
court
did
they
raise
for
the
first
time
that
they
didn't
have
their
collateral
attack.
mr.
robert
d.
joffe
he
did,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
joffe
he...
he
issued
several
rulings.
and
i
believe
they
were
alternative
rulings.
mr.
robert
d.
joffe
that's
the
issue
in
which
the
court
granted
cert,
but
i
would
think,
your
honor,
now
that--
mr.
robert
d.
joffe
--your
honor--
mr.
robert
d.
joffe
--your
honor,
i
believe
they
were
heard
on
the
merits.
the
findings
i
refer
to
and
that
are
referred
to
in
our
brief
demonstrate
they
were
heard.
they
did
lose
on
the
merits.
the
eleventh
circuit,
for
whatever
reasons,
overlooked
that,
and
that
the
court
cannot
find
against
us,
unless
it
finds
that
collateral
attacks
are
allowed,
and
that
there
was
no
trial
on
the
merits.
or
put
another
way,
if
you
find
that
there
was
a
trial
on
the
merits,
you
need
never
reach
the
other
issue.
i'd
like
to
reserve
what
remains
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
d.
joffe
the
notion
that
this
notice
was
inadequate
comes
pretty
poorly
from
the
mouth
of
the
united
states
government
which
drafted
the
notice.
mullane
and
tulsa
do
not
seem
to
me
to
apply
here.
they
deal
with
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute
on
its
face
which
is
intended
to
apply
to
all
situations,
and
not
with
a
situation
where
due
process
was
met
in
this
situation.
there's
no
question
oklahoma
could
have
provided
for
due
process
to
be
determined
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
they
instead
chose
a
statute
and
they
chose
an
inadequate
statute.
in
mullane
and
tulsa,
the
parties
did
not
have
notice.
it's
a
very
different
situation
than
this
one--
mr.
robert
d.
joffe
--absolutely.
although
i
think,
your
honor,
they
should
go
back
to
the
consent
decree
court
for
that,
not
filing
a
separate
lawsuit,
but
certainly
that
could
be
raised.
mr.
robert
d.
joffe
it's
a...
that
is
a
question
to
the
damage
action.
with
respect
to
prospective
relief,
it's
a
somewhat
different
question,
and
it's
a
question
whether
in
their
separate
title
vii
case,
as
opposed
to
going
back
into
the
decree
court
seeking
to
intervene
on
changed
circumstances
of
fact
or
law.
it's
a
question
of
whether
in
this
case
they
can
relitigate
that.
there's
no
question
but
that
they
could
have
intervened
in
that
proceeding,
whether
their
cause
of
action
had
arisen
or
not.
they
could
have--
mr.
robert
d.
joffe
--if
there
had
been
no
hearing
and
notice,
i
would
agree,
they
could
certainly
come
in
and
bring
their
title
vii--
mr.
robert
d.
joffe
--it's
both
a
defense
to
their
damage
claim
and
it's
a
reason
why
they
shouldn't
be
able
to
relitigate
this
issue.
they,
in
effect,
waived
their
rights.
and
essentially,
they
didn't...
they
either
waived
their
rights
if
they
didn't
appear
at
that
hearing
or
they
appeared
at
their
hearing
through
the
proxy,
the
bfa,
which
was
fighting
affirmative
action
tooth
and
nail
and
made
every
argument
at
that
hearing
that
they...
every
substantive
argument
that
they've
made
throughout
the
course
of
this
litigation.
they
were
not
deprived
of
anything,
your
honor.
as
far
as
whether
the
denial
of
intervention
was
somehow
unfair,
in
naacp
v.
new
york,
this
court
affirmed
the
trial
court's
denial
of
information
on
the
basis
of
a
single
article
in
the
new
york
times,
and
a
15-day
delay.
the
delay
was
more...
shorter,
the
notice
far
more
ephemeral
than
what
sat
here.
and
moreover,
they
could
have,
of
course,
applied
for
cert
to
this
court
from
the
eleventh
circuit's
affirmance
of
the
denial
of
certiorari.
they
chose
not,
they
chose
to
gamble
on
the
uncertain
state
of
the
law
and
pursue
this
other
lawsuit.
the
rule
which
they
urge
would
mean
that
decrees...
consent
decree
cases
and
litigated
cases
could
be
attacked
in
separate
proceedings
by
whoever
was
affected
by
them,
not
matter
how
much
notice
they
had,
how
much
opportunity
they
had
to
be
heard.
thank
you.
