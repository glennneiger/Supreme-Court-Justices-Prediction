mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
the
court
today
is
whether
a
district
court
should
hear
the
title
vii
and
equal
protection
claims
of
plaintiffs
who
were
denied
promotions
on
the
basis
of
their
race
when
their
employer
simply
alleges
that
the
challenged
actions
were
taken
pursuant
to
a
court-approved
consent
decree.
we
believe
it
is
improper
to
allow
an
employer
to
bargain
away
the
title
vii
and
constitutional
rights
of
non-parties
and
bind
them
to
their
settlement.
this
is
especially
true
in
the
context
of
this
case,
where
intervention
was
sought
before
entry
of
the
consent
decree
and
denied.
through
their
joint
invocation
of
the
timeliness
provisions
of
rule
24,
as
well
as
the
so-called
no-collateral
attack
doctrine,
the
petitioners
have
effectively
insulated
their
decrees
and
their
conduct
from
the
scrutiny
of
adversarial
litigation
brought
by
the
people
who
have
in
fact
been
denied
promotions,
and
thereby
denied
the
respondents
a
day
in
court.
i
want
to
address,
if
i
may,
justice
o'connor's
question
right
up
front,
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
we
had
that
collateral
attack.
when
the
district
court
heard
the
motions
to
dismiss
on
may
14,
1984,
it
set
out
the
issues,
and
that
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
is
in
the
joint
appendix.
but
it,
at
that
time,
at
the
motion
to
dismiss
stage,
adopted
the
no-collateral
attack
position
and
held
that
the
only
way
that
we
could
prevail
would
be
to
prove
that
the
city
was
not
in
fact
following
the
consent
decree,
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
paragraph
two
of
the
decree,
which
we
believe
provides
a
caveat
to
the
terms
of
the
decree.
again,
in
its
february
1985
interim
order
on
motions
for
partial
summary
judgment,
the
court
again
repeated
that
its
earlier
discussions
with
counsel
on
what
it
believed
the
trial
issues
were,
and
the
fact
that
we
could
not
collaterally
attack...
the
word
"collateral"
isn't
even
appropriate,
because
we
were
not
parties.
we
could
not
attack
actions
taken
pursuant
to
the
decree.
the
court
carefully
limited
all
of
the
pre-trial
preparation,
culled
our
witness
list,
and
directed
the
preparation
for
trial,
and
the
eleventh
circuit
recognized
all
of
this
and
noted
it
in
its
decision.
and
in
its
final
order,
which
was
drafted
by
the
petitioners,
the
court
made
passing
references
to
its
prior
positions
that
the
decree
is
lawful.
at
any
rate,
we
believe
that
the
respondents
should
not
be
bound
by
the
decrees
which
were
entered
in
this
case,
because
they
were
not
parties
nor
privies
to
parties
to
the
decree
parties,
both--
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
--yes,
justice.
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
litigated
decree
or
not,
in
my
view,
if
non-parties
had
filed
separate
litigation
subsequent
to
entry
of
that
decree,
after
having
been
denied
promotion,
i
would
think
the
district
court
might
take
into
account
the
prior
findings
and...
but
still
allow
the
respondents
to
prove--
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
--excuse
me,
justice.
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
in
the
view
of
the
eleventh
circuit,
which
i
believe
is
the
correct
view,
that
would
make
no
difference
whether
it
was
a
litigated
decree
or
not.
and
i
think
that's
consistent
with
the
chase
national
bank
v.
city
of
norwalk
rule.
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
yes--
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
--that
is
the
defense
which
the
petitioners
have...
have
alleged,
and
they
believe
it
is
a
complete
defense.
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
we
want
the
opportunity
to
go
to
court
and
prove
that
under
title
vii
in
the
equal
protection
clause,
the
conduct
of
the
city
of
birmingham
is
outside
the
parameters
of
valid
affirmative
action
as
recognized
by
this
court
in
johnson
and
wygant.
that
is
what
the
eleventh
circuit
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court
for.
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
no,
that
is
not
an
issue
upon
which
certiorari
was
granted,
although
that
was
raised
by
the
petitioners.
cert
was
denied
on
that
issue.
the...
the
eleventh
circuit
in
this
case
first
held
that
the
decree
should
not
be
binding
upon
the
respondents
who
were
non-parties
to
the
decree.
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
when
you
say...
you
mean
in
our
challenge--
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
--in
our
subsequent
challenge,
yes,
we
believe
we
should
be
able
to
attack
the
city's
conduct,
even
though
it's
taken
pursuant
to
a
consent
decree
or,
in
the
case
of
a
litigated
decree,
if...
if
we
have
been
denied
promotions
pursuant
to
a...
to
a
court
order,
which
is
beyond
the
remedial
authority
of
that
court...
and
of
course
there
are
some
differences
between
what
is
permissible
in
the
realm
of
voluntary
action
and
remedial
action
under
706(g).
the...
but
if
those
actions
were
taken
outside
the
court's
remedial
authority
in
a
litigated
case,
then
i
believe
the
non-parties
ought
to
be
able
to
say,
no,
this
is
wrong.
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
we
believe...
when
the
first
of
challenge
promotions
was
made
in
this
case,
we
sought
preliminary
relief.
the
district
court
denied
that
relief
and
we
appealed
to
the
eleventh
circuit.
that
appeal
was
consolidated
with
the
appeal
from
the
intervention
proceedings.
the
eleventh
circuit
said
that
there
should
be
no
irreparable
injury
because
make
whole
relief
was
available
to
any
non-minority
employees
who
were
improperly
denied
promotions.
we
believe
that
the
appropriate
remedy
in
this
case
would
be
make
whole
relief
in
the
form
of
preferential
promotions
or
seniority
or
back
pay.
whether
the
city
was
following
a
decree
is...
might
be
liable
as
to
whether
or
not
the
city
could
be
liable
for,
say,
punitive
damages
under
section
1983.
that...
it
might
be
relevant
in
that
situation.
but
simply
because
they
were
following
a
consent
decree
does
not
in
our
view
provide
some
limits
on
the
availability
of
make
whole
relief.
as
the
court
recognized
in
the
w.r.
grace
case,
the
city
has
voluntarily
placed
itself
in
a
dilemma
of
its
own
making.
and
in
grace
the
employees
were
entitled
to
recover
their
back
pay,
even
though
the
employer
in
grace
was
acting
pursuant
to
a
conciliation
agreement
which
had
been
ordered
enforced
by
a
district
court.
so--
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
--yes,
i...
i
see
your
point
there,
justice.
if
the
city
was
not
the
architect
of
its--
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
--well,
the
city,
in
the
words
of
the
mayor
in
his
deposition,
made
the
best
business
deal
it
had
ever
made
when
it
settled
this
case
for
$265,000.
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
no,
sir.
i'm
not
claiming
it's
a
collusive
settlement.
i'm
saying
that
the
city
was
eager
to
make
the
settlement.
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
yes,
sir.
but
i--
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
--yes,
we've
all
settled
cases.
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
the
original--
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
--let,
let...
yes.
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
in
a
hiring
case.
that
is
a
good
question.
in
a
hiring
case,
the...
of
course,
if
a
hiring
quota
or
goal
is
ordered,
of
course
the...
it...
one
cannot
be
certain
who
the
remedy
will
affect
down
the
line.
it
will
affect
the
public
at
large
or
the--
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
--who
has
to
be
joined...
i
would
think
it
would
be
appropriate
to
join
a
defendant
class
of
applicants,
of
current
applicants
perhaps,
to
the
city.
the
personnel
board
which
administers
the
examinations
continuously
gives
examinations
and
maintains
a
register
of
eligibles,
and
it
would
be
easy
for
the
existing
parties--
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
--i
would
think
that
they
would
be
adequate
representatives
for
the
interests
of
those
who
might
apply
to
the
city
of
birmingham,
and
therefore
might
be
subject
to
the
relief
which--
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
--through
a
defendant
class.
justice
o'connor's
question,
as
i
understood
it,
asked
me
for
a
vehicle
upon
which
potential
applicants
to
the
city
might
be
bound
by
a
decree
and,
in
my
view,
a
possible
vehicle
for
achieving
that
goal
would
be
through
a
defendant
class
of
the
persons
on
the
register
of
eligibility,
who
would
then
be
adequate
representatives
for
the
potential
new
hires
of
the
city.
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
not
to
my
knowledge,
justice
kennedy,
although...
let
me,
if
i
may,
i
think
it
was
within
the
parameter
of
justice
o'connor's
question,
briefly
state
that
the
suits
which
were
brought
in
'74
and
'75
were
very
broad
pattern
and
practice
suits,
not
only
against
the
city
of
birmingham,
but
against
the
jefferson
county
personnel
board
and
some
20
or
25
other
municipalities
in
the
jefferson
county
area.
it
alleged...
this
was
not
a
fire
department
suit.
the
fire
department
was
just
one
of
many,
many
departments
whose
employment
practices
might
have
been
at
issue.
in
fact,
during
that
period
of
1976
through
'79,
the
suit
was
primarily
concerned
with
police
officer
hiring
and
firefighter
hiring.
and
to
the
knowledge
of
the
firefighters,
the
only
thing
that
this
suit
was
about
was
just
a
hiring
case
involving
entry-level
firefighters.
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
during
the
hearings?
the
respondents
were
not
represented
at
the
hearing.
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
no,
sir.
the
respondents...
the
respondents
only
sought
legal
counsel
after
they
were
in
fact
denied
promotions.
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
no.
your
honor,
the
association,
the
firefighters'
association,
which
is
not
a
collective
bargaining
agent,
was
aware
of
the
pendency
of
the
lawsuit--
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
--no,
sir.
there
is
no
such
evidence.
and--
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
--the
respondents
are
all
members
of
the
association.
at
least
one
of
the
respondents
was
not
even
employed
by
the
city
of
birmingham
at
the
time
the
suits
were
filed.
the
association,
though,
in
our
view,
is
not
an
adequate
representative--
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
--i
don't
believe
that...
that
is
not
record
evidence,
but
i
don't
believe
the
association
went
out
and
notified
all
its
members
that
the
litigation
was
pending
and--
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
--no,
sir.
your
honor,
the
respondents
were
not...
the
individual
respondents
who
are
before
this
court
today
were
not
aware
of
the
litigation.
the
evidence
is
that
the
firefighters'
association
and
the
union
president
had
knowledge
of
the
pendency
of
that
litigation
which
he
understood
to
be
a
hiring
case.
in
fact,
during
the
1979
trial,
no
fire
department
promotional
examination
was
attacked.
the
trial
in
'79
which
concerned
promotional
practices
was
primarily
concerned
with
examinations
for
promotions
in
other
departments.
the...
the
trial
did
involve
some
promotional
devices,
screening
devices,
that
were
also
employed
in
the
fire
department,
but
the
principal
focus
of
that
trial
was
on
the
validity
of
certain
examinations.
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
that
fire
department
promotions
were
implicated
in
this
suit?
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
it
only...
the
only...
the
first
time
that
any
fire
department
promotions
were
specifically
mentioned
was
in
the
consent
decree
itself.
in
fact,
the
fire
chief
himself
so
testified,
that
he
did
not
know
fire...
fire
department
promotions
were
implicated
in
the
litigation
until
a
consent
decree
was
entered,
and
he
was
given
the
charge
of
enforcing
it
in
the
fire
department.
the--
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
--apparently
there
were
some
newspaper
stories
about
the
filing
of
this
litigation.
yes,
sir.
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
the...
the
petitioners
have
cited
newspaper
articles
in
their
brief,
but--
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
it
involved
the
greater
jefferson
county
area.
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
no,
i
didn't
say
that,
justice
marshall.
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
it's
my
understanding
that
the
petitioners
have
cited
newspaper
articles
in
their
briefs,
and
i
will
take
their
word
for
it
that
their
briefs
are
accurate,
although
i
have
not
gone
back
and
read
those
old
articles.
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
yes,
my
firefighters,
i
believe,
can
read.
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
well,
we
do
not
believe
that
a
story
in
the
newspaper
is
an
appropriate
vehicle
upon
which
to--
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
--they
said
that
they
did
not
know
about
the
particular
fact
that
they
were
looking
for
promotional
goals
in
the
birmingham
fire
and
rescue
service.
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
there
was
a
case
pending
which
challenged
employment
practices
in
the
jefferson
county
area.
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
where
they
work.
and
they
basically
thought
it
was
a
hiring
case,
which
is
where
most
of
the
focus
was
during
the
mid-1970s.
the...
in
our
view,
the
need
to
carefully
police
affirmative
action
plans
would
be...
would
be
furthered
by
allowing
suits
such
as
those
by
respondents
to
go
forward.
the
court
recognized
in
fullllove
that
simply
because
the
court
was
approving
the
set-aside
in
the
context
of
that
case,
that
it
did
not
preclude
further
challenges
based
on
specific
applications
of
the
set-aside.
and
we
believe
that
in
the
context
of
this
case,
the
policing
of
affirmative
action
plans
would
be
furthered
by
allowing
suits
such
as
these
to
be
heard,
especially
under
the
facts
of
this
case
where
the
city
has
been
following
a
50
percent
quota
with
only
a
13
percent
qualified
black
applicant
pool
for
promotion.
no
consideration
was
given
by
the
city
to
the
relative
qualifications
of
competing
black
and
white
candidates.
race
was
not
a
plus
factor,
it
was
the
only
factor.
and
we
believe
the
merits
of
the
case
to
be
heard
in
the
district
court
are
very
strong.
the--
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
--that...
that
is
my
personal
assurance
today.
that
matter
was
not
a
matter
of
record.
it
was
not--
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
--correct.
it
is
the
court,
in
the
mullane,
in
the
tulsa,
and
in
the
other
cases
which
look
at
adequacy
of
notice,
does
not
look
at
what
notice
was
received
but
rather
what
notice
was
given.
in
the
tulsa
case
last
term,
the
court
stated
that
actual
notice
is
such...
individual
notice
by
mail
or
such
other
means
as
is
certain
to
ensure
actual
notice.
and
the
burden
to
give
notice
upon
known
interested
parties
is
on
the
petitioners
in
the
context
of
this
case,
who
are
the
existing
parties
to
the
litigation,
who
certainly
could
have
given
notice
to
their
existing
employees.
mr.
raymond
p.
fitzpatrick,
jr.
absolutely,
justice.
we
believe
that
the
mandatory
joinder
theory
is
wrong.
but
even
if
the
court
went
to
that
sort
of
a
theory
that
there
was
no
adequate
notice
in
the
context
of
this
case,
but
that
is
correct.
we
reject
and
we
do
not
believe
that
the
court
need
reach
the
question
of
whether

was
given

there
was
no
duty
to
intervene,
and
the
mandatory
intervention
theory
should
not
be
accepted.
i
see
my
light
is
on.
