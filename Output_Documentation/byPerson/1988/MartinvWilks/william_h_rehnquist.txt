chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
87-1614,
martin
against
wilks
and
companion
cases.
mr.
alexander,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
had...
had
the
people
who
sought
to
intervene
there,
were
they
named
in
that
action?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
people
who
sought
intervention,
had
they
been
named
as
defendants
in
the
action?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
know
why
they
weren't
named?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
know,
some
of
our
cases,
like
justice
brandeis'
opinion,
i
think,
in
chase
national
bank
against
the
city
of
norwalk,
there
isn't
any
duty
to
intervene
in
a
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
trying...
are
you
suggesting
a
special
rule
for
this
type
of
case?
you're
suggesting
that
case
is
wrongly
decided?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what...
what
has
changed
that
would
make
that
case
inapplicable?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
was
quite
a
different
case
from
this,
though.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is...
is
that
a
fact,
could
complete
relief
have
been
afforded
without--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
but
it...
it
certainly
was
going
to
have
an
effect
on
their
careers
in
city
government,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
city
could
have
brought
in
these
people.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
alexander.
mr.
joffe?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
certainly
notice...
notice,
in
the
sense
of
knowledge,
has
never
been
thought
to
be
an
adequate
substitute
for
service,
if
you're
trying
to
get
jurisdiction
over
somebody.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
my
point
was
that
knowledge
and
notice
have
never
been
thought
as
a
substitute
for,
for
service.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
can
you
cite
some
case
from
this
court
which
has
applied
the
equitable
doctrine
of
waiver
to
someone
against
whom
relief
was
granted,
it
was
not
made
a
party
to
the
action?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
this...
the
problem
here,
to
my
mind,
is
not
due
process
but
simply
the
rules.
do
the
rules
say
that
you
must
alert
yourself
to
actions
that
are
going
on
and
intervene?
or
do
the
rules
require
that
parties
to
be
affected
by
a
judgment
should
be
joined?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
xxx
parties
at
this
time?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
did
they
get
the
normal
sort
of
trial
on
that
issue
that
you
would
if
it
hadn't,
in
the
judge's
view,
been
tried
before?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
was
the
basis
for
the
judge's
decision
in
the
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
joffe.
mr.
fitzpatrick,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
fitzpatrick.
mr.
merrill,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
merrill.
mr.
joffe,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
joffe.
the
case
is
submitted.
