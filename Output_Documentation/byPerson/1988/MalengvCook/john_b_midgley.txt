mr.
john
b.
midgley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mark
edwin
cook's
habeas
petition
is
not
a
request
to
have
this
court
rule
that
he
is
in
custody
on
the
1958
conviction.
mr.
cook
is
in
custody;
we
know
that
because
he
is
in
prison.
he
is
in
prison
based
on
both
the
federal
and
state
convictions
that
mr.
eikenberry
has
discussed.
mr.
john
b.
midgley
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
it
is
correct
under
a
combination
of
both
peyton
versus
rowe
and
braden
versus
the
thirtieth
judicial
district
cases.
under
peyton,
peyton
i
think
uses
the
word
"aggregate"
of
the
sentence,
that
he
is
in
custody
on
the
aggregate,
so
he
is
certainly
in
prison
on
the
aggregate
of
them.
and
i
believe
that
braden
deals
with
the
question
of
where
the
petition
may
be
brought
on
the
state
conviction.
mr.
john
b.
midgley
well,
he
is
in...
that's
right.
he's
in
prison--
mr.
john
b.
midgley
--on
the
aggregate.
he's
now
in
the
federal
sentence,
that's
correct,
and
will
serve
the
washington
sentence
consecutively.
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
that
he
was
in
a
washington
prison
at
this
point
because
he's
not.
but
the
jurisdictional
question
of
where
he
may
bring
the
habeas
petition
i
believe
that
if
you
look
at
both
peyton
versus
rowe
and
braden
he
is
allowed
to
attack
the
future
sentence,
obviously,
under
peyton,
and
under
braden
i
think
that
he
could
have
brought
it
in
california,
i
believe,
under
braden.
but
i
think
that
braden
implies
that
you
can
also
bring
it
in
the
judicial
district
where
it
was
obtained.
if
not,
then
i
would
suggest
that
the
only
relief
in
this
case
would
be
to
vacate
the
petition
and
simply
state
that
it
be
refiled
in
california.
we
don't
believe
that
is
necessary
under
the
braden
case,
but
that
would
be
the
situation.
now,
mr.
cook
is
simply
claiming
that
the
1958
conviction
lengthens
the
amount
of
time
he
will
have
to
spend
in
prison
on
his
1978
state
sentence,
and
this,
as
this
court
said
in
preiser
versus
rodriguez,
where
you're
talking
about
the
duration
of
the
actual
physical
confinement
that
you
will
have
to
spend
in
prison,
is
within
the
core
of
federal
habeas
corpus.
mr.
john
b.
midgley
that's
not
this
case,
because
in
this
case
state
statutes
require
that
a
particular
amount
of
time
be
added
to
his
prison
term.
mr.
john
b.
midgley
it
would
probably
follow
and,
frankly,
i
think
that's
the
tucker
case.
i
think
that's
the
case
of
when
a--
mr.
john
b.
midgley
--well,
i
believe,
justice
kennedy,
that
in
tucker
what
had
happened
is
mr.
tucker
had
gotten
another
court,
a
california
court,
to
rule
his
louisiana
and
florida
prior
convictions
unconstitutional
and
refused
to
use
them
for
enhancement
of
a
california
conviction,
and
in
tucker
there's
a
footnote
where
the
court
said
that
there
is
still
an
issue
regarding
the
third
conviction.
so
i
don't...
and
my
recollection
of
tucker
is
not
that
they
were
invalid
on
their
face
but,
rather,
there
had
been
proceedings
in
which
the
validity
had
been
discussed.
mr.
john
b.
midgley
it
is
not
a
holding
of
tucker,
because
tucker,
although
tucker
is
a
2255
case,
tucker
does
not
hold
that.
but
tucker
and
burgett
make
the
holdings
on
which
all
of
the
circuits,
virtually,
have
made
the
decision
that
it's
a
logical...
the
logical
implication
of
tucker
and
burgett
that
enhancing
prior
convictions
may
be
inquired
into
in
federal
habeas
corpus.
for
the
last
20
or
25
years,
this
is
what
the
circuits
have
held.
it
is
simply
a
logical
implication
of
those
cases.
mr.
john
b.
midgley
i
wouldn't
argue
that
in
an
double
jeopardy
sense
he's
being
repunished
for
the
'58
crime,
but
he
is
in...
he
will
be
in
state
prison
pursuant
to
the
'78
judgment.
mr.
john
b.
midgley
and
the
'58
lengthens
the
term.
mr.
john
b.
midgley
justice
scalia,
there
are
a
number
of
answers
to
your
question.
first
of
all,
your
question
presumes
that
mr.
cook
knew
that
there
was
something
to
challenge.
now
the
only
record
we
have
in
this
case
is
that
in
1977,
when
they
tried
to
impose
the
habitual
criminal
proceedings
on
him,
the
state
brought
out
these
documents
which
they
conceded
did
not
show
that
there
had
been
a
competency
hearing.
that
was
the
only
point
we
know
in
this
record
that
mr.
cook
himself
may
have
had
some
idea
that
there
was
a
problem.
mr.
john
b.
midgley
it
assumes
that
there
would
have
been
an
attack
earlier.
mr.
john
b.
midgley
the
states...
yes.
i
would
not
concede
that
it's
an
overwhelming
probability.
i
think
the
states
are
constitutionally
permitted
to
use
prior
convictions
to
add
time,
but
they
are
not
constitutionally
permitted
to
use
constitutionally-invalid
prior
convictions
to
add
time.
mr.
john
b.
midgley
well,
that's
not
the
issue
in
this
case,
because
the
issue
in
this
case
is
that
the
state
statutes
require
that
a
particular
amount
of
time
be
added
under
those.
it
is
not,
as
justice
scalia
was
questioning
me
about,
it
is
not
a
question
of
the
state
looking
at
a
number
of
different
factors.
the
parole
board
in
this
case
is
required--
mr.
john
b.
midgley
--the
constitutional
difference
between
the
two
is
two.
first
of
all,
that,
as
this
court
said
in
burgett
and
tucker,
the
state
may
not
enhance
sentence
based
on
constitutionally-infirm
convictions
because
it
renews
the
constitutional
violation.
and
it
renews
the
constitutional
violation
by
adding
prison
time
based
on
invalid
constitutionally-invalid
prior
convictions.
mr.
john
b.
midgley
no,
that's
not
my
premise.
mr.
john
b.
midgley
that's
not
my
premise,
that
it's
invalid
on
its
face.
washington--
mr.
john
b.
midgley
--well,
the
convictions
were
not
invalid
on
their
face
in
tucker
at
the
time
sentence
was
imposed.
the
california...
in
my
recollection,
the
california...
tucker
is
a
2255.
he
filed
the
2255
long
after
sentence
and
said
a
court
has
invalidated
the
prior
convictions;
now
i
don't
think
they're
valid.
and
the
federal
court,
the
ninth
circuit,
said
then
they
can't
be
considered.
and
this
court
said
the
question
of
his
third
prior
conviction
is
still
open.
and
washington
law
requires
that
the
underlying
convictions
be
constitutional.
it
does
not
require,
under
the
ammons
and
the
bush
cases
that
we've
cited
in
the
briefs...
and
this
is
a
key
point...
does
not
require
that
the
state
affirmatively
prove
the
constitutional
validity
in
the
sentencing
proceeding.
but
it
does
presume
their
constitutionality
because--
mr.
john
b.
midgley
--i
understand
that.
but
the
important
point
is
that
washington
does
presume
the
constitutionality
of
the
convictions
to
support
its
sentence.
and
it
directs
people
to
go
to
their
collateral
remedies
and
if
then
they
are
declared
invalid
for
this
use,
which
is
all
mr.
cook
is
claiming...
he
is
not
claiming
he
is
in
prison
on
the
1958.
mr.
john
b.
midgley
i
would...
first
of
all,
that
isn't
the
case
that's
before
us.
mr.
john
b.
midgley
i
think
that
tucker
says
that
any
consideration...
that
tucker
implies,
if
you
will,
that
any
consideration
of
invalid
priors
is...
would
give
grounds
for
collateral
relief.
but
that
is
not
necessary...
it
is
not
necessary
to
go
that
far
to
decide
this
case,
because
in
this
case
mandatory
state
statutes
require
that
a
certain
amount
of
time
be
added.
mr.
john
b.
midgley
i
think
that
that
is...
the
state
has
brought
this
up
on
a
custody
question
and
i
think
that
is
a
substantive
constitutional
question
which
is
not
before
the
court
because
whether
a
particular
kind
of
claim
can
be
brought
is
not
a
custody
issue;
it
is
a
question
of
substantive
constitutional
law
about
whether,
for
example,
an
uncounseled
conviction...
i
think
tucker
and
burgett
talk
specifically
about
uncounseled
convictions,
and
i
think
that
the
state
essentially
is
asking
this
court
to
decide
in
advance
a
whole
array
of
substantive
constitutional
questions
about
which
kinds
of
convictions.
are
they
saying
that
you
can't
attack
a
prior
where
there
wasn't
a
trial,
that
that
couldn't
violate
due
process
in
any
circumstance?
mr.
john
b.
midgley
i
think
that,
to
address
the
issue
that's
before
the
court
in
this
case,
i
think
there
would
be
custody
to
make
that
claim,
and
it
would
then
be
a
substantive
constitutional
question
whether
a
miranda
violation,
using
a
conviction
which
was
allegedly
invalid
under
a
miranda
violation,
is
itself
a
constitutional
violation.
mr.
john
b.
midgley
i
understand
that.
mr.
john
b.
midgley
my
answer
is
i
think
that
that
could
be
determined
in
habeas
proceedings.
mr.
john
b.
midgley
yes,
it
could
be.
yes,
that
is
my
answer.
mr.
john
b.
midgley
yes.
mr.
john
b.
midgley
yes,
it
has
been
enhanced
in
the
sense
that
there
has
been
a
finding
by
the
trial
court
that
he
was
armed
with
both
what's
called
under
washington
law
a
deadly
weapon
and
a
firearm.
now
the
effect
of
those
will
be
to
put
him
within
enhancement
statutes
that
the
parole
board
applies,
and
the
enhancement
statutes
are
what
we
call
in
the
briefs
mandatory
minimum
terms.
they
are
like
a
special
parole
board.
mr.
john
b.
midgley
the
statement
is
correct
that
it
is
available
for
use
when
the
board
actually
sets
the
term.
mr.
john
b.
midgley
it's
not
correct
that
it
was
lengthened,
but
it
is
very
certain,
because
of
the
provisions
of
state
law,
that
it
will
be.
i
think
again
this
goes
back
to
peyton
versus
rowe,
the
state
saying
we
don't
really
know
what's
going
to
happen.
our
showing,
on
pages
four
to
nine
of
our
brief,
is
we
do
know
that
the
'58
conviction
is
going
to
have
a
specific
lengthening
effect.
mr.
john
b.
midgley
justice
o'connor,
there
is--
mr.
john
b.
midgley
--yes,
and
there
are
proof
problems
in
there,
but
there
are
proof
problems
on
both
sides.
and
i
think
that
rule
9(a)
of
the
rules
governing
section
2254
cases
certainly
is
an
issue
that
may
be
available.
it's
not
before
the
court
in
this
case.
mr.
john
b.
midgley
yes,
i
think
that's
correct.
and
the
state
did
raise
it
below
but
it
hasn't
been
determined
and
it's
not
before
this
court.
but
it's
certainly
an
available
issue
in
some
cases.
but
it
must
meet
all
the
other
criteria,
which
the
lower
courts
have
upheld.
mr.
john
b.
midgley
well,
i
would
suggest
that
on
this
record
we
don't
know
that
and
that
that's
one
thing
that
the
district
court
needs
to
inquire
into,
is
he
had
been
incarcerated
in
mental
hospitals.
we
don't
know
what
his
circumstances
were
before.
we
know
that
he
knew
in
1977,
because
the
state
tried
to
impose
the
habitual
criminal
enhancement
on
him,
and
at
that
point
he
did
know
that
there
was
a
defect.
but
on
this
record
the
court
doesn't
know
when
he
did
know.
mr.
john
b.
midgley
well,
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that
laches
would
necessarily
keep
the
challenge
out
in
every
case.
there
are
some
federal
circuit
court
cases
which
suggest
in
this
circumstance
that
the
laches
period
would
run
when
the
state
imposes
the
new
sentence.
mr.
john
b.
midgley
well,
to
say
that
it's
laches
is
perhaps
not
the
right
use
of
the
term.
i
think
rule
9(a),
which
is
based
partly
on
laches,
may
be
applicable
in
some
cases,
and
that's
all
i
was
conceding
or
saying.
i
don't
think
that
you
can,
particularly
on
this
record,
i
don't
think
that
you
can
say
that
the
27-year
delay
is
automatically
attributable
to
my
client,
and
i'm
not
saying
that
you
could
start
the
clock
right
at
the
beginning.
it
would
depend
on
the
circumstances
and
it
would
depend
on
the
circumstances
based
on
when
the
present
harm
began.
mr.
john
b.
midgley
a
judge
in
sentencing--
mr.
john
b.
midgley
--well,
the
problem
is
that
the
parole
board
is
not
now
free
to
add
that
time
on
that
grid
based
on
mere
arrest.
there
must
be
the
fact
of
conviction,
and
under
washington
law
the
conviction
must
have
been
constitutionally
obtained
for
that--
mr.
john
b.
midgley
--the
answer
is
yes,
that
the
judge
could
consider
that
in
sentencing,
but
it
has
no
effect
on
the
parole
board
because
the
judge
has
only
set
that
maximum
sentence.
the
actual
duration
of
confinement,
which
is
the
words
that's
used
in
preiser
versus
rodriguez,
as
being
at
the
core
of
habeas
corpus,
duration
of
confinement
is
set
by
the
board,
and
the
board
has
to
look
at
that
conviction
in
order
to
set
that
time.
mr.
john
b.
midgley
no,
you
do
not.
mr.
john
b.
midgley
the
board
can't
go
over
the
maximum
on
this
grid,
but
the
board
now
must
start
with
the
two-factor
grid...
the
seriousness
of
the
crime
and
prior
record.
so
the
maximum
sentence
has
no
impact
of
constraining
the
board
in
that
sense.
what
does
have
the
impact
of
constraining
the
board
is
the
mandatory
state
statute
which
says
if
he
has
the
1958
conviction
you
must
give
him
more
time
in
prison.
mr.
john
b.
midgley
i
think
there
is
certainly
a
question
about
how
they
come
to
that
evidence.
there's
a
due
process
question
about
how
that's
presented.
mr.
john
b.
midgley
and
about
what
the
quality
of
that
evidence
is.
and
that's
part
of
what
this
court
has
said
and
all
the
circuits
in
playing
out
the
implications
of
this
court's
decision,
this
is
not
something
i'm
proposing.
this
is
something
the
circuits
have
been
doing
for
many
years,
and
this
is
not
something
we're
proposing
as
a
great
expansion
of
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction
because
it's
been
being
done.
but
the
question
is
the
reliability,
the
constitutional
reliability
of
that
information,
and
this
court
has
said
that
those
prior
convictions
which
are
unconstitutional
are
not,
at
least
as
to
counsel...
and,
we
would
suggest,
as
to
the
kind
of
defect
we
have
in
this
case
where
the
defendant
claims
he
was
incompetent
at
the
time
of
the
trial...
is
a
fundamental
defect
which
casts
doubt
on
the
reliability
of
the
conviction.
and
that's
unreliable
information.
that
goes
all
the
way
back
to
townsend
versus
burke.
you
can't
sentence
on
the
basis
of
a
due
process
violation.
you
sentence
on
the
basis
of
material,
untrue
information.
and
this
court,
as
recently
as
johnson
versus
mississippi,
talked
again
about
not
having
that
sort
of
unreliable
information
in
sentencing.
and
that's
what
these
cases
are
based
on,
and
that's
the
basis
of
the
constitutional
violation
that
we're
claiming.
and
the
state
again
is
going
back
and
trying
to
get
this
court
to
determine
those
substantive
questions,
and
that
is
not,
we
submit,
the
question
before
this
court.
he
is
in
custody.
he's
claiming
that
his
custody
was
lengthened
by
an
unconstitutional
prior
conviction,
and
habeas
corpus--
mr.
john
b.
midgley
--i
think
that
that's
a
question,
a
legitimate
question,
in
any
habeas
corpus
cases.
whether
this
sort
of
defect
is
at
issue
is
a
constitutional
violation
or--
mr.
john
b.
midgley
--yes,
there
is.
in
this
case
i
don't
think
it's
open
to
them
because
the
defect
is
so
fundamental.
i'll
give
you
an
example
of
a
case
that
would
raise
an
issue,
and
that
is
a
stone
versus
powell
question.
it
seems
to
me
that
a
fourth
amendment
claim
you
run
into
problems
with
stone
versus
powell.
as
to
competency,
you
don't
have
those
problems;
therefore,
i
think
the
constitutional
issue
is
open
to
him.
but
i
really...
that's
a
substantive
constitutional
question
or
another
question
of
habeas
corpus.
it's
not
a
custody
question.
mr.
john
b.
midgley
they
have,
and
we've
cited
cases
in
our
brief
and
both
of
the
amicus
briefs
have
cited
circuit
cases
from
as
far
back,
i
believe,
as
the
'60s,
following,
but
at
least
from
the
early
'70s
following
this
court's
lead
in
burgett
and
tucker,
and
looking
at
priors
which
do
make
these
kinds
of
enhancements.
mr.
john
b.
midgley
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
b.
midgley
this
court
has
not
gone
beyond
that.
this
court
did
say
in
burgett
that
prior
unconstitutional
convictions
should
not
be
used
to
enhance
sentence,
but
they
were
dealing
with,
the
court
was
certainly
dealing
with
uncounseled
convictions.
and
the
circuits
have
all
applied
it,
certainly,
to
that,
to
that
issue.
but
that's
correct.
burgett
and
tucker
did
not
go
beyond
the
issue
of
counsel.
finally,
i'd
like
to
add
that
there
is
a
counsel
issue
in
this
case,
and
that
is
simply
that
of
course
if
a
person's
incompetent
he
doesn't
have
the
ability
to
assist
counsel.
obviously
there
are
also
issues
of
presence,
and
we're
saying
essentially
that
this
is
such
a
fundamental
defect
that
there's
no
question
that
he
should
be
able
to
raise
this
in
his
federal
habeas
petition.
so
for
all
the
reasons
that
we've
stated,
we
ask
that
the
ninth
circuit
be
affirmed
because
mr.
cook
is
in
custody,
because
he
challenges
the
length,
the
duration
of
his
imprisonment
as
unconstitutional,
and
that
is
what
section
2254
and
2241
require.
thank
you.
