how
long
remains
on
the
federal
sentence?
justice
kennedy
how
long
remains
on
the
federal
sentence?
justice
kennedy
and
would
you
have
the
same
qualification
for
review
in
the
case
that
the
chief
justice
put
to
you
where
there's
a
habitual
offender
statute?
justice
kennedy
why?
justice
kennedy
so
under
a
habitual
offender
statute
a
previous
offense
can
be
tested
on
habeas?
justice
kennedy
for
invalidity
in
any
respect?
justice
kennedy
well,
then
suppose
all
of
those
convictions
are
valid
on
their
face.
suppose
none
of
them
have
been
set
aside
by
a
state
court.
there
is
still
habeas
jurisdiction
to
attack
those
three
convictions,
in
your
view?
justice
kennedy
well,
what's
the
federal
violation?
i
don't
know
why
you
concede
that.
what's
the
federal
law
issue?
justice
kennedy
the
hypothetical
is
the
habitual
offender
statute,
previous
convictions.
the
previous
convictions
are
valid
on
their
face,
they
have
not
been
set
aside
by
any
state
court,
and
the
prisoner
seeks
federal
habeas
to
attack
those
earlier
convictions
in
order
to
modify
or
vacate
the
habitual
offender
statute.
i'm
asking
you
what
is
the
federal
violation.
justice
kennedy
and
if
he
raises
any
federal
constitutional
issue
at
all,
he
can
have
habeas
to
test
those
earlier
convictions?
justice
kennedy
yes,
assuming
that.
justice
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
so
sure
why
that
doesn't
foreclose
your
argument
here,
then.
justice
kennedy
and
then
i
take
it
the
same
would
be
true
if
a
judge
in
sentencing,
without
reference
to
any
specific
enhancement
provisions
in
a
statute,
simply
said
i
have
looked
at
your
record
and
i
take
into
account
the
fact
that
you've
been
convicted
two
or
three
previous
times
and
i'm
going
to
take
that
into
account.
justice
kennedy
but
under
your
argument
wouldn't
the
same
follow?
justice
kennedy
well,
but
in
tucker
the
conviction
was
invalid
on
its
face.
justice
kennedy
but
it's
certainly
not
a
holding
that
a
federal
habeas
action
lies
in
order
to
inquire
into
the
validity
of
any
conviction
that
the
court
might
have
made
reference
to
in
sentencing.
justice
kennedy
but
of
course
that
isn't
the
question
in
this
case.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
it
follows
from
that
that
any
time
reference
is
made
to
a
prior
conviction
that
there
is
automatically
federal
habeas
review
to
reopen
those
convictions
based
on
an
alleged
infirmity.
justice
kennedy
but
what's
the
constitutional
difference
between
the
two?
justice
kennedy
we're
back
where
we
started.
your
whole
premise
is
that
it's
invalid
on
its
face.
justice
kennedy
that's
the
whole
question.
justice
kennedy
except
that
that's
what
happened
in
tucker.
justice
kennedy
are
you
saying
that
it's
open
to
the
state,
then,
on
remand
to
argue
that
habeas
doesn't
lie
to
cure...
to
inquire
into
this
particular
defect?
justice
kennedy
well,
there's
a
constitutional
requirement
for
a
competency
hearing,
isn't
there?
justice
kennedy
and
you
say
that
for
years
the
circuits
have
been,
and
the
district
courts
have
been
holding
habeas
hearings
on
these
kinds
of
questions?
