justice
stevens
general
eikenberry,
can
i
ask
you
just
a
question
going
to
sort
of
what
i
understand
to
be
your
basic
position?
supposing
this
was
a
capital
case
instead
of
a
man,
life
and
50
and
20,
and
all
these
long-term
sentences,
it
was
a
capital
case
and
one
of
the
aggravating
circumstances
was
a
conviction
back
in
1958.
and
the
only
claim
he
wants
to
make
is
a
challenge
to
that
conviction,
and
he
brings
it
into
state
court
and
raises
that
challenge.
would
there
be
jurisdiction
to
consider
that,
in
your
view?
justice
stevens
well,
he's
immediately
under
on
a
capital
sentence.
justice
stevens
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
your
answer
to
my
question
is
yes,
that
you
could
look
at
the
old
conviction.
justice
stevens
and
why
is
this
different?
i
thought
your
answer
was
no.
justice
stevens
it
wasn't
very
clear.
justice
stevens
well,
but
that
may
be
a
narrow
scope
of
review.
the
question
that
we've
got
here
is
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
question,
whether
there
is
any
review
at
all.
and
i
take
it
your
position
is
you
just
can't
look
at
it,
period
if
the
earlier
conviction
has
expired
by
its
terms.
justice
stevens
may
i
then
ask
you
another
question?
supposing
we're
five
or
six
years
down
the
road
and
we're
at
a
point
at
which
the
parole
board
reviewing
his
application
for
parole
would
say
to
itself,
well,
he's
done
everything
and
he
would
now
get
out
except
for
one
thing,
because
of
that
1958
conviction
back,
it's
now
40
years
ago
or
50
years
ago.
that's
the
one
thing
that's
preventing
his
release.
and
we
know
that's
an
unconstitutional
conviction.
why
is
he
not
then
within
the
plain
language
of
2254(2)
being
held
in
custody
in
violation
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states?
justice
stevens
and
then
would
a
federal
court
have
jurisdiction
to
correct
that
constitutional
error
five
years
in
the
future?
justice
stevens
well,
what
are
you
arguing
here?
justice
stevens
are
you
just
arguing
scope
of
review
rather
than
jurisdiction?
justice
stevens
that's
always
true.
very
rarely
do
you
admit
it.
but
i'm
just
trying
to
get
i
don't
understand
why
the
federal
court
has
power
in
one
case
and
does
not
have
power
in
the
other
case.
if
you
have
to
argue
about
the
constitutionality,
there's
no
jurisdiction.
if
it's
plain
on
its
face,
there
is
jurisdiction.
justice
stevens
that
isn't
the
language
of
the
statute.
it
doesn't
say
in
custody
pursuant
to.
it
says
he's
in
custody
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
that's
what
the
language
of
the
statute
is.
justice
stevens
well,
he
is
in
custody
pursuant
to
the
judgment
of
a
state
court.
that
we've
gotten
over.
the
detainer
takes
care
of
that.
justice
stevens
no.
but
he
is
in
custody.
he
satisfied
that
language
if
he's
in
custody
pursuant
to
an
outstanding
conviction.
and
then
the
question
is
what
questions
may
he
raise
in
a
habeas
corpus,
and
he
raises
the
question
that
his
custody
does
violate
the
constitution.
it
may
be
because
of
an
old
conviction
or
it
may
be
because
of
all
sorts
of
other
errors.
justice
stevens
correct.
justice
stevens
if
he's
in
custody
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
but
the
question
is,
why
is
that?
and
just
to
say
that
he's
not
in
custody
doesn't
answer
it.
it
would
seem
to
me
the
question...
the
answer
is
that
in
one
case
it's
invalid
on
its
face
and
therefore
it's
a
federal
violation
to
hold
him
based
on
a
facially
invalid
conviction.
