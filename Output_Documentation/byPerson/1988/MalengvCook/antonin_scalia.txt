justice
scalia
right.
but
if
you
have
a
higher
median
from
which
you
deviate,
the
deviation
will...
and
if
the
deviation
is
the
same,
you'll
end
up
higher?
justice
scalia
so
we
can
assume
that
this
is
going
to
have
an
effect
on
his
sentence?
justice
scalia
you're
saying
we
don't
know
it
here.
isn't
that
your
point...
that
here
we
don't
know
it?
you
say
if
we
know
it's
unconstitutional,
by
which
you
mean
if
it's
unconstitutional
on
its
face
or
if
it's
been
set
aside
by
some
court,
then
you
can
get
the
habeas?
justice
scalia
but
if
we
don't
know
it,
a
federal
court
cannot
inquire
into
it?
justice
scalia
mr.
midgley,
your
client
is
not
being
punished
for
the
1958
act.
you
concede
that.
i
mean,
we
do
have
a
double
jeopardy
clause.
he's
being
punished
for
his
latest
crime
and
not
for
the
'58
crime,
correct?
i
mean,
the
fact
that
you
use
that
as
an
enhancement
of
his
sentence
is
quite
separate
from
whether
you
are
punishing
him
again
for
the
'58
crime.
justice
scalia
that's
right.
justice
scalia
and
in
deciding
how
much
he
should
be
punished
for
the
'78
crime
the
states
take
account
of
all
sorts
of
things,
not
just
prior
crimes,
but
maybe
the
degree
of
remorse
he
has
shown,
which
may
be
evidenced
by
various
things,
and
they
are
really...
how
dangerous
he
will
be
if
let
out.
and
those
are
all
probabilities
aren't
they?
i
mean,
you're
guessing
as
to
how
dangerous
it'll
be.
now
why
isn't
it
reasonable
for
the
state
to
say
when
there
are
outstanding
prior
convictions
it
is
enormously
probable
that
this
fellow
is
going
to
be
very
much
more
dangerous.
should
we
let
him
out?
that
would
explain
why
general
eikenberry
can
say
when
those
prior
convictions
are
invalid
on
their
face
or
have
been
set
aside
then
they
can
be
reviewed
on
federal
habeas
because
then
it
is
as
a
matter
of
due
process,
not
reasonable
to
rely
on
those
probabilities.
the
probability
doesn't
exist.
but
isn't
all
sentencing
a
matter
of
probabilities,
and
isn't
it
an
overwhelming
probability
that
when
there's
a
sentence
on
the
books
that
hasn't
been
set
aside,
he
hasn't
challenged
it
in
habeas,
he's
i
likely
to
be
a
more
dangerous
fellow?
justice
scalia
why
does
my
question
assume
that
he
knew
that
he
had
something
to
challenge?
justice
scalia
no,
it
doesn't.
all
my
question
assumes
is
that
in
the
overwhelming
majority
of
cases
the
fellow
who
has
an
outstanding
conviction
on
his
record
is
going
to
be
more
dangerous
than
someone
who
doesn't.
that's
all
it
assumes,
and
that
is
an
overwhelming
probability,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
i
really
don't
see
how
that
fits
with
your
theory
of
laches.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
his
sentence
is
being
enhanced
unconstitutionally
we
can
really
say
well,
we're
sorry.
it
isn't
a
past
harm
that
we're
saying,
well,
it's
too
late
for
us
to
give
you
any
recompense
for
this
past
harm,
which
is
what
usually
is
the
situation
in
laches.
you
know,
you
can't
recover
any
more
for
that
past
harm.
this
is
a
present
harm.
you're
telling
us
your
client's
in
jail
and,
on
the
one
hand,
you
say
yes,
i
need
immediate
relief,
and
on
the
other
hand
say
well,
there
can
be
laches.
this
is
not
the
ordinary
laches
case.
justice
scalia
if
your
theory
is
correct,
i
don't
see
how
laches
applies
in
any
case.
he
is
being
currently
harmed
by
the
state
and
he
claims
that's
unconstitutional.
i
don't
see
how
you
say
it's
all
past
harm
and
it's
now
too
late
to
complain
about
it.
it's
current
harm.
justice
scalia
mr.
midgley,
let
me
ask
you
this.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
sentence
all
the
time
on
the
basis
of
probabilities.
it
is
the
case,
is
it
not,
that
if
your
client
had
not
been
convicted
for
these
prior
criminal
acts
but
there
was
just
some
evidence
on
which
he
was
arrested
and
then
released
that
that
could
be
introduced
in
sentencing
and
a
sentencing
judge
or
jury
could
consider
evidence
of
prior
criminal
acts
as
to
which
there
had
not
been
convictions
in
sentencing.
right?
justice
scalia
and
that
would
have
been
okay
and
had
the
enhancement
been
based
on
that
you
could
keep
him
in
jail.
but
you're
telling
us
that
since
he
was
convicted
you
can't
keep
him
in
jail
unless
you
go
back
and
prove
the
validity
of
that
conviction.
that
seems
to
me
a
very
strange,
very
strange
system.
if
he
hasn't
been
convicted,
you
can
keep
him,
but
if
he
has
been
you
can't.
justice
scalia
well,
i'm
not
concerned
about
washington.
i'm
concerned
about
any
sentencing
judge.
is
it
not
the
law
that
a
sentencing
judge
could,
on
the
basis
of
unconvicted,
evidence
of
crimes
for
which
the
defendant
has
not
yet
been
convicted
but
evidence
of
them,
could
give
him
a
longer
sentence,
which
which
the
parole
board
would
then
have
to
make
its
adjustments?
i
think
the
answer
is
yes.
but
you're
telling
us
that
if
he
does
it
on
the
basis
of
a
conviction
then
you
have
to
prove
the
conviction
was
valid.
justice
scalia
but
don't
you
start
with
the
sentence
that's
been
imposed?
justice
scalia
you
don't
start
with
the
sentence
imposed?
justice
scalia
well,
i
think
that
shows
that
the
discrepancy
does
not
exist
under
this
state
sentencing
scheme,
but
still
as
a
theoretical
matter
it
seems
to
me
you
are
proposing
something
that
looks
very
strange
in
another
context.
washington
could
have
put
on
its
grid
evidence
of
prior
crimes
for
which
the
defendant
has
not
been
convicted.
it
simply
has
not
happened
to
do
so,
but
it
could
have
done
that,
and
that
would
have
been
constitutional
under
our
cases.
right?
and
you
wouldn't
have
to
prove
those
crimes;
you
just
have
to
say
considerable
evidence
of
crimes.
justice
scalia
sure.
