justice
o'connor
was
the
federal
sentence
expressly
enhanced
by
virtue
of
the
'58
conviction?
justice
o'connor
well,
he
certainly
is
in
custody
under
the
federal
sentence.
justice
o'connor
so
presumably
he
can
raise
whatever
he
wants
to
with
regard
to
the
basis
for
that
sentence.
justice
o'connor
is
that
part
of
what
his
amended
pleadings
now
challenge
and
raise?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
thought
there
was
a
specific
notice
of
amendment
of
the
original
petition
that
has
filed
in
the
district
court
in
washington.
justice
o'connor
not
a
letter,
a
notice
of
an
amendment?
justice
o'connor
well,
general
eikenberry,
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
we
don't
yet
know
how
long
this
defendant
will
have
to
serve
in
the
1978
conviction
in
state
court;
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
because
under
washington
law
a
board,
a
state
board,
will
make
that
determination
at
such
time
as
he
finally
is
turned
over
to
state
authorities,
is
that
correct?
justice
o'connor
and
under
the
new
washington
law
that
would
be
applied
they
apply
a
grid
which
includes
giving
factors
or
points
for
prior
convictions,
including
the
'58
conviction;
is
that
correct?
justice
o'connor
and
you
concede
that
if
the
board
were
to
apply
that
grid
as
it
is
designed
it
would
lengthen
the
sentence
he
otherwise
would
serve
on
the
'78
conviction?
justice
o'connor
okay.
justice
o'connor
well,
it
says
it
was
lengthened.
now
technically
he
hasn't...
that's
never
been
determined.
so
it
isn't
correct,
technically.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
think
general
eikenberry
conceded
that
it
will
have
some
effect
ultimately
today.
do
you
think
that,
even
if
you're
right
that
this
challenge
can
be
made,
that
some
principle
of
laches
ought
to
kick
in
at
some
point
so
we
don't
get
back
in
all
these
cases
to
impossible
situations
to
try
to
determine?
justice
o'connor
this
was
27
years
ago,
for
goodness
sakes.
justice
o'connor
so
laches
might
properly,
in
some
cases,
be
raised
by
the
state
and
say,
look,
we've
been
harmed
by
this.
we
can't
make
this
proof
now.
justice
o'connor
because
at
least
this
defendant
presumably
could
have
made
this
very
claim
long
before
now,
when
the
'58
conviction
was
still
alive
and
kicking.
