mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
appearing
here
this
morning
in
opposition
to
a
petition
by
prison
inmate
mark
edwin
cook
for
issuance
of
the
great
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
question
presented
here,
in
our
view,
is
this:
does
a
federal
court
have
subject
matter
jurisdiction
over
a
habeas
corpus
challenge
to
a
1958
robbery
conviction,
the
sentence
for
which
had
expired
before
the
petition
was
filed
but
which
may
have
an
effect
on
the
length
of
time
to
be
served
in
the
future
on
another
sentence
for
an
unrelated
crime.
now
in
addition
to
this
issue,
which
may
be
viewed
as
somewhat
technical,
we
think
there's
an
additional
and
necessarily
related
question,
and
that
is
what
are
the
standards
and
the
scope
of
review
to
be
applied
in
a
challenge
to
the
length
of
that
future
sentence.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
in
fact,
i'd
like
to
suggest
that
there
four,
actually
four
convictions
here
that
all
interplay
with
one
another.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
yes,
your
honor,
we
would.
if
i
may,
i'll
list
those
four
convictions
because
they
do
interplay
and
i
believe
will
have
a
bearing
on
how
the
court
looks
at
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
the
thing
i'd
like
to
do,
your
honor,
is
posture
this
so
that
we're
focusing
on
the
distinction.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
well,
we'd
like
to
reserve
using
the
word
"enhancement",
your
honor,
and
get
to
that.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
but
the
beginning
point,
of
course,
was
in
1958,
where
mr.
cook
was
convicted
of
three
counts
of
robbery
and
sentenced
to
three
terms
of
not
more
than
20
years.
that
sentence
has
now
expired,
which
we
think
is
a
critical
feature
of
the
case
before
the
court.
the
second
conviction
was
in
1965,
when
mr.
cook
was
convicted
of
three
counts
of
robbery
and
sentenced
to
three
50-year
terms,
and,
incidentally,
a
detainer
has
been
placed
on
that
conviction.
the
third
conviction
occurred
in
1976
in
federal
court,
when
mr.
cook
was
convicted
of
robbery
and
conspiracy
with
25
and
5-year
terms,
and
that
is
the
case
on
which
he
is
now
in
custody
at
lompoc,
california.
and
then
the
fourth
and
final
conviction
that
brings
us
to
court
today
is
a
conviction
in
state
court
in
1976,
with
the
sentencing
occurring
in
1978,
in
which
he
was
found
guilty
of
two
counts
of
assault
in
the
first
degree
and
sentenced
to
two
life
terms
and
then
another
court
of
aiding
a
prisoner
to
escape,
with
a
10-year
term.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
your
honor,
there
was
no
grid
or
anything
at
that
point
which
we
would
say
that
the
court
looked
in
determining
what
length
of
time
there
would
be.
rather,
it
was
simply
a
matter
of
the
'58
conviction
having
been
in
the
background,
the
sentencing
court
in
'78
being
aware
of
it,
and
the
impact
that
may
or
may
not
have
had
on
that
maximum
term
of
two
life
terms
we
can
only
guess.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
yes,
your
honor,
we
would
be.
you
are
quite
right.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
well,
except
we
would
concede
to
the
extent
that
a
detainer
has
been
placed
for
that
'78
conviction,
that
perhaps
that
the
issue
or
that
custody
has
been
created
in
the
'78
sentence.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
the
custody
cases
such
as--
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
--well,
i
would
suggest
the
carafas
case,
the
jones
and
the
hensley
cases
all
suggest
that
the
kind
of
detainer
restraint
based
on
the
'78
sentence
that
has
been
placed
against
mr.
cook
would
be
equivalents,
hensley
being
an
individual
out
on
bond
during
appeal,
jones
being
a
person
who
had
been
paroled,
and
then
carafas
being
a
person
who
had
filed,
of
course,
while
he
was
in
custody
serving
a
term.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
i
cannot
say.
he
was
sentenced
in
'76
and
it
was
a
25-year
term,
so
his
actual
time...
i
suppose
he's
approaching
the
time
when
he
might
be
considered
for
release,
but
it
would
be
to
the
detainer
that's
been
placed
by
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
we
do
not
know,
your
honor,
but
the
point
of
the
question
i
think
is
extremely
important
because
we
are
seeing
the
prospect
here
that
we
must
imagine
that
that
court
also
was
aware
that
a
'58
conviction
had
occurred
and
would
have
had
it
in
mind,
taken
it
into
account
as
the
court
settled
on
the
25-year
term.
so
they
may
or
may
not,
but
we
would
have
to
bet
probably
was
an
effect
on
that
sentence
imposed
in
'76
by
the
federal
court.
and
so
the
interesting
question
then
would
be,
does
that
create
the
custody
that
mr.
cook
is
asking
for
in
the
'58
conviction,
and
we
assert
that
it
does
not.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
physical
custody,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
he
can
raise
the...
he
is
in
custody
for
the
physical
custody
that
he's
in
under
the
federal
case.
we
would
suggest
that
he
is
in
custody
for--
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
--no,
your
honor.
i
believe
the
amended
pleadings,
if
the
court
is
referring
to
the
letter
that
was
sent
in
just
last
week,
was
intending
to
move
from
a
challenge
to
the
1958
conviction
to
expressly
name
the
1978
sentence.
and
we
believe
that
probably
that
was
because
he's
trying
to
get
around
this
jurisdictional
problem
that
we're
walking
up
on
here.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
just
last
week,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
i'm
sorry,
yes.
it
was
forwarded
to
us.
we
received
it
in
our
office.
we
sent
a
copy
to
this
court
and
so
that
attempt
has
been
made.
whether
it's
effective
or
not,
we
would
suggest
it
is
not.
but
certainly
the
basis
upon
which
the
court
will
proceed
i
think
is
not
influenced
significantly.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
there
would
be
jurisdiction
to
consider
the
sentence
under
which
he
is
in
immediate
restraint,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
exactly.
and
then
the
question
is
what
kind
of
challenge
may
be
brought
to
that
previous
conviction
that
was
used
and
considered
in
imposing
the
death
penalty.
and
what
we're
submitting
to
the
court
is
that
the
review
given
to
that
earlier
conviction
is
different
in
scope
than
what
would
be
given
to
the
immediate
trial
and
the
immediate
conviction,
because
the
review
would
simply
look
to
see
whether
or
not
the
previous
convictions
were
invalid
on
their
face
or
whether
they
had
previously
been
determined
by
another
court
to
have
been
invalid.
and
we're
thinking
here,
for
example,
of
the
tucker
case,
in
which
the
trial
court
had
learned
of
three
felony
convictions
of
the
defendant
before
him,
and
then
when
it
came
time
for
sentencing
the
court
specifically
considered
those
three
convictions,
and
only
after
the
sentencing
learned
that
two
of
them
were
invalid
on
their
face
when
the
record
came
before
the
court.
and
that
matter
was
then
before
this
court
and
it
was
sent
back
for
resentencing.
so
there
was
a
case
of
the
general
rule
being
that
a
sentencing
court
or
a
reviewing
court
will
allow
a
sentencing
judge
to
consider
a
wide
range
and
a
very
loose
sense
and
flexible
standard
as
to
the
convictions
that
may
be
considered.
but--
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
what
i'm
saying
is--
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
--what
i'm
suggesting,
your
honor,
is
the
court
would
use
a
very
narrow
scope
of
review.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
yes.
we're
submitting,
your
honor,
that
mr.
cook
in
no
way
is,
in
the
words
of
section
2254,
in
no
way
is
he
a
person
in
custody
pursuant
to
the
judgment
ordered
by
our
state
court
in
1958.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
yes,
because
there
is
a
critical
difference
in
the
kind
of
proceeding
the
court's
just
described.
that
is
a
habitual
criminal
proceeding.
the
defendant
is
being
found
guilty
of
a
new
status.
it's
a
different
crime,
if
you
will,
and
so
that's
all
part
of
the
newest
conviction
and
sentence,
and
it
is
reviewable.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
no,
your
honor,
he
did
not
say
that,
and
we
cannot,
i
don't
think
we
can
know
at
this
point
exactly
what
role,
if
any
role,
it
had
in
determining
that
mr.
cook
should
be
sentenced
to
two
life
terms.
now
i
should
mention
and
anticipate
the
argument
that
you'll
hear
in
a
moment
because
in
addition
to
the
sentence
to
two
life
terms
mr.
cook,
when
he
comes
back
to
the
state
of
washington,
will
go
before
a
parole
board,
if
you
will,
and
his
minimum
term
will
be
set.
and
we've
had
more
events
in
the
meantime.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
your
honor,
we
are
saying
he's
not
in
custody
on
a
1958
conviction,
but
we
may
review
the
'78
conviction--
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
--yes,
your
honor,
that's
true.
and,
taking
the
next
step,
then,
the
only
review
that
will
be
given
to
the
1958
conviction
that's
been
considered
by
the
'78
sentence
in
court
is
whether
it's
valid
on
its
face
or
whether
some
other
court
has
determined--
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
--the
review
would
be
broader,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
because
there
we're
looking
at
the
conviction
and
the
basis
for
it,
and
just
as
an
entire
larceny
trial
would
be,
conviction
would
be
subject
to
review.
it
would
be
the
same
kind
of
thing.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
for
this
reason,
your
honor.
at
habitual
criminal
trial
we
plead
that
the
defendant
has
just
been
convicted
on
whatever
the
current
charge
is
and
then
we
plead
that
he's
been
convicted
on,
say,
three
other
convictions.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
yes,
your
honor,
because
they
are
elements
of
the
new
conviction
that
the
court
has
just
reached
in
sentencing.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
i'm
not
understanding
the
court's
last
question.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
i'm
assuming
the
prisoner
would
be
pleading
that
some
constitutional
defect
had
occurred
in
the
process,
in
the
trial
process,
that
resulted
in
his
habitual
criminal
conviction.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
yes,
your
honor,
providing
he's
exhausted
his
remedies
in
state
court.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
yes.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
let
me,
if
i
may,
your
honor,
go
to
the
sentencing
standards
that
this
court
has
established
in
three
cases
because
i
think
that
might
bring
us
to
the
question
that's
been
raised
here.
we
agree
that
in
reviewing
a
sentence
which
places
a
person
in
custody
the
court
should
consider
prior
convictions
which
were
a
factor
in
making
that
determination.
the
cases
and
common
sense
tell
us
that
proper...
those
are
proper
subjects
for
a
sentencing
court
to
consider.
i
indicated
that
the
tucker
case
before
sets
out
the
general
rule,
which
is
that
in
the
absence
of
circumstances
such
as
jones
or
hensley
or
tucker
then
a
trial
judge,
and
i'm
quoting
from
tucker,
"a
trial
judge
generally
has
wide
discretion
in
determining
what
sentence
to
impose.
"
"before
making
that
determination,
a
judge
may
appropriately
conduct
an
inquiry,
broad
in
scope,
largely
unlimited
as
to
the
kind
of
information
it
may
consider
or
the
source
from
which
it
may
come.
"
and
three
justices
of
this
court,
in
a
dissenting
opinion
in
schaal
versus
martin
not
long
ago,
relied
on
that
language
and
phrased
it
a
little
differently.
"the
constitutional
limitations
upon
the
kinds
of
factors
that
may
be
relied
on
in
making
such
decisions
are
significantly
looser
than
those
decisionmaking
processes
that
abridge
the
liberty
of
presumptively
innocent
persons.
"
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
well,
what
i'm
attempting...
the
reason
for
reading
that
quotation
was
simply
to
indicate
the
general
rule
and
indicate
that
there
is...
that
a
sentencing
court
has
a
looser
set
of
restrictions,
if
you
will,
on
what
factors
may
be
considered
in
arriving
at
a
sentence,
but,
conversely,
when
this
court
is
reviewing
that
process
we
must
recognize
that
that
court
had
a
wide
discretion
and
therefore
the
only
thing
we
would
look
at
at
the
'58
conviction,
with
an
expired
sentence,
is
is
it
valid
on
its
face.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
a
couple
of
important
things,
your
honor.
first,
the
ninth
circuit
misapplied
the
law.
it
is
referring
there
to
a
statute
that
is
no
longer
authority
and
simply
didn't
apply
the
law
that
was
in
effect.
but
it
doesn't
make
much
difference
to
us
in
arguing
the
case
to
the
court.
we
can
acknowledge,
will
acknowledge
that
there
may...
the
betting
is
that
there
will
be
an
effect
from
that
1958
conviction.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
we
cannot
know
that,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
we'll
accept
that.
i
would
only
like
to
draw
this
distinction,
your
honor,
that
you'll
soon
hear
references
to
the
sentencing
grid
that
will
be
used
by
the
parole
board,
and
that
will
show
you,
that
will
show
the
court
that
certain
points
are
given
because
of
the
1958
conviction.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
that,
too,
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
with
one
addition,
if
i
may,
and
that
is
that
that
will
then
establish
the
median
from
which
the
board
may
deviate
in
any
direction
they
wish,
according
to
what
they
see
as
mitigating
or
aggravating
circumstances
completely
different
from--
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
for
the
purpose
of
this
court's
decision,
absolutely,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
if,
as
the
court
said,
we
know
that
he
has
an
unconstitutional
conviction,
then
certainly
in
that
narrow
scope
of
review--
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
--this
court
would
certainly
grant
relief
and
the
court,
the
district
court
would
certainly
grant
relief.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
what
i'm
arguing
is
that
we
don't
have
habeas
corpus
custody
jurisdiction
that
will
grant
the
broad
kind
of
relief
to
1958
in
the
same
way
that
we
do
for
the
'78.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
no.
we
must--
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
i
would
submit
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
it
is
an
unconstitutional
conviction
at
all.
in
fact,
to
the
contrary.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
let's
put
it
this
way,
your
honor.
so
far
as
mr.
cook
is
concerned
and
whether
there's
an
additional
two
and
a
half
years,
it
makes
little
difference.
what
is
important
is
that
where
we
have
a
1958
conviction,
the
sentence
expired,
we
don't
think
it's
appropriate
to
read
the
section
2254
to
say
that
he
is
now
in
custody
pursuant
to--
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
--the
previous
language,
your
honors,
is
"in
custody
pursuant
to".
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
but
not
for
the
'58
conviction,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
and
the
sequence
of
steps,
your
honor,
is
that
he
has
been...
he
is
in
custody
pursuant
to
the
1978
sentence.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
and
any
review
of
the
1958
conviction,
which
has
an
expired
sentence,
may
only
be
to
look
to
see
if
it's
invalid
on
its
face.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
and
the
point
i've
been
attempting
to
make,
your
honor,
is
that
there
are
different
standards
of
review
depending
on
whether
we're
challenging
a
conviction
or
whether
we're
challenging
a
sentence.
and
that's
the
distinction
we've
been
trying
to
draw.
if
i
may,
i
would
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
yes.
may
it
please
the
court:
two
points.
the
first
point
is
that
the
1958
conviction
is
valid.
it
has
been
found
to
be
valid
in
washington
courts,
and
i
suppose
if
we
had
to
predict
we
might
well
make
it
on
the
competency
issue
even
today,
if
it
were
heard
out.
that
is,
the
defense
lawyer
for
mr.
cook
made
the
motion
to
the
court
to
have
doctors
appointed.
the
defense
lawyer
presented
the
order
to
have
mr.
cook
transported
to
the
hospital.
the
record
shows
the
doctors
were
paid
and
then
mr.
cook
went
to
trial
with
that
same
lawyer.
so
if
there's
a
question
for
mr.
cook
to
raise
that
were
legitimate
it
would
perhaps
be
as
to
competence
of
his
counsel--
but
we
think
that's
all
really
beside
the
point
because
the
conviction
has
been
found
valid
on
its
face.
the
point
that
we'd
like
to
make
is
this
is
being
brought
27
years
after
the
conviction,
seven
years
after
the
expiration
of
the
sentence.
we
think
this
process
would...
does
undercut
finality
and
the
credibility
of
the
system.
we
would
encourage
the
court
to
send
the
matter
back
with
the
clear
expression
that
any
challenge
that
may
be
brought
is
through
the
1978
sentence
rather
than
as
directly
against
the
'58
conviction.
that
concludes
my
presentation.
