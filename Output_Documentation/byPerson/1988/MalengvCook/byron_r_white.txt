justice
white
i
take
it
that...
may
we
consider
this
case
just
as
though
he
was
actually
serving
a
state...
what
if
the
state
is
the
one
that
had
him
in
jail,
that
has
him
in
jail
now?
he's
now
serving
a
federal
sentence?
justice
white
yes,
but
suppose
he
was
now
serving
the
'78
sentence,
state
sentence?
you
would
still
be
making
the
same
argument?
justice
white
well,
i
didn't
think
it
would
have
any
bearing.
i
thought
you
said
it
would
be
the
same
situation
if
he
were
now
serving
the
'78
state
sentence.
justice
white
the
latest
state
sentence
is
'78?
justice
white
and
that's
the
one
that
was
enhanced
by
the
'58
sentence,
is
that
right?
justice
white
okay.
justice
white
was
that
sentence
enhanced
by
reason
of
the
'58?
justice
white
i
know.
but
even
if
it
were...
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument
you're
making
even
if
it
were
expressly
enhanced
by
the
'58
sentence?
justice
white
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
thought
that
the
'78
sentence
was
enhanced
by
the
'58,
didn't
it?
otherwise
you
wouldn't
be
here,
i
don't
suppose.
justice
white
and
you
say
that
whatever
enhancement
there
was
was
permissible
and
if
there
was
an
enhancement
it
was
permissible
and
that
since
the
'58...
and
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
'58
conviction
was
valid
or
not
because
it's
expired
and
you
just
can't
be
in
custody
under
that.
justice
white
even
if,
as
ca
9
held,
there
was
enhancement
by
reason
of
the
'58
conviction?
justice
white
well,
we
are
judging
the
case
that
way,
aren't
we?
we
have
to
take
that.
we're
not
going
to
go
into
washington
law.
justice
white
well,
the
chief
justice
read
a
sentence
out
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
about
two
and
a
half
years.
justice
white
is
that
statement
correct?
i
mean,
the
court
of
appeals
certainly
thought
that
the
'78
sentence
had
been
enhanced.
justice
white
so
that
statement
is
correct
by
the
court
of
appeals?
