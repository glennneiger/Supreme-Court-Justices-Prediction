chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
88-357,
norm
maleng
v.
mark
edwin
cook.
general
eikenberry,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
general
eikenberry,
there's
something
that
gives
me
pause
here.
i'm
not
sure
it
was
raised
by
any
of
the
parties,
but
it's
certainly
part
of
the
statutory
basis
of
jurisdiction,
and
that
is
that
the
defendant,
the
prisoner,
at
this
time
is
not
in
the
custody
of
the
state
of
washington.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
of
our
cases
would
you
say
supported
that
proposition?
chief
justice
rehnquist
such
as?
i
mean
peyton
against
rowe
was
two
successive
sentences,
both
by
virginia
courts,
and
at
the
time
it
was
challenged
virginia
had
custody.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
now
what
if
the
'78
conviction
were
a
habitual
offender.
the
washington
statute
says
if
the
sentencing
judge
finds
in
the
sentencing
procedure
that
you
have
two
additional
felonies,
then
you
can
be
committed
for
20
years
where
under
the
'78
charge
you
could
only
be
committed
for
5
years.
the
sentencing
judge
does
find
that
there
was
an
additional
felony
committed
in
'58
and
so
he
sentences
him
as
a
habitual
offender.
is
that
reviewable
if
he's
in
custody
under
the
'78?
chief
justice
rehnquist
okay.
well,
then
what
was
the
situation
with
respect
to
what
the
'78
sentencing
judge
did
with
respect
to
the
'58
conviction?
did
he
say
in
so
many
words
that
i'm
taking
this
into
account,
i'm
giving
you
a
heavier
sentence?
chief
justice
rehnquist
don't
let
anybody
put
words
in
your
mouth.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
eikenberry,
if
you
are
answering
judge
kennedy's
question,
go
ahead
and
then
i
have
a
question
for
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
general
eikenberry,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
on
page
a3
of
the
appendix,
its
opinion
that
the
respondent's
conviction
was
lengthened
by
two
and
one-half
years
because
of
his
prior
convictions.
now
is
that
consistent
with
what
you
said
earlier,
that
we
just
can't
say
what
happened
in
1978?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
it
was
specifically
taken
into
account
in
some
way
by
the
judge
who
sentenced
in
1978,
so
that
the
'78
sentence
was
longer
by
reason
of
the
'58
conviction?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
general
eikenberry.
mr.
midgley,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
that
strictly
accurate,
to
say
that
he
is
presently
in
prison
by
virtue
of
the
state
sentence
as
well
as
the
federal
sentence?
chief
justice
rehnquist
he
may
be
in
custody
under
our
cases
pursuant
to
the
washington,
but
i
think
you
said
he
was
in
prison
presently
pursuant
to
the
washington
conviction.
i
thought
that
just
wasn't
factually
correct.
chief
justice
rehnquist
for
the
federal
sentence.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
we
didn't
certiorarily
take
this
case
to
pass
on
some
peculiarity
of
washington
law.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
supposing
that
we
get
to
the
parole
board
situation
after
your
client
has
served
his
federal
sentence
and
suppose
the
parole
statute
simply
says
that
the
parole
board
may
take
into
consideration,
among
a
number
of
other
factors,
previous
convictions.
would
you
say
that
that
would
be
enough
to
allow
him
to
challenge
the
'58
conviction?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
we
need
to
probe
a
little
bit
to
find
out
what
you're
getting
and
what
we're
getting
at.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
that
if
the
claim
as
to
the
'58
conviction
were
that
his
miranda
rights
were
violated,
that
could
be
litigated
in
this
case
now.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--well,
do
you
say
that
you
can
attack
a
prior
under
these
circumstances
when
there
was
simply
a
violation
of
the
miranda
rule?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
the
parties
may
be
limited
to
the
questions
presented,
but
the
justices
aren't.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
what's
your
answer?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
that
would
be
something
that
could
be
litigated
in
a
habeas
proceeding?
chief
justice
rehnquist
of
course,
both
burgett
and
tucker
were
uncounselled.
chief
justice
rehnquist
this
court
has
never
gone
beyond
that.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
midgley.
mr.
eikenberry,
general
eikenberry,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
eikenberry.
the
case
is
submitted.
