mr.
richard
g.
taranto
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
these
cases
in
involve
facial
challenges
to
the
constitutionality
of
congress'
1988
legislation
aimed
at
commercial
telephone
pornography.
section
223(b)
of
the
communications
act
of
1934,
as
it
was
amended
in
1988,
prohibits
any
person
from
making
any
obscene
or
indecent
interstate
telephone
communication
for
commercial
purposes.
sable
challenged
both
the
obscenity
and
indecency
prohibitions
on
their
face.
the
district
court,
on
a
motion
for
preliminary
injunction,
held
the
obscenity
prohibition
valid
and
the
indecency
prohibition
invalid.
our
position
is
that
both
challenges
should
have
been
rejected.
as
to
obscenity,
which
is
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
the
short
answer
to
sable's
objections,
concerning
how
the
statute
is
to
be
applied,
is
that
they
are
insufficient
to
support
a
facial
challenge,
because
the
statute
plainly
is
capable
of
constitutional
application.
as
to
indecency,
the
statute
is
justified
by
a
distinctive
combination
of
factors
similar
to
those
relied
on
in
the
broadcasting
context
in
pacifica:
the
accessibility
of
the
telephone
medium
to
children,
the
compelling
governmental
interest
in
preventing
children,
especially
younger
children,
from
hearing
patently
offensive
sexual
speech,
especially
in
the
privacy
of
the
home,
the
reasonable
congressional
judgment
that
no
lesser
measure
would
reliably
prevent
children's
access,
and
the
availability
of
alternative
sources
of
such
speech
for
adults
who
wish
to
obtain
it.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
we
don't
have
any
kind
of
statistical
breakdown
of--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
it...
it
would
depend
on
exactly
what
was
said.
the
indecency
definition
is
essentially
one
part
of
the
three-part
miller
definition
for
obscenity.
the
material
need
not
have
prurient
appeal
in
the
specific
sense
that's
required
for
obscenity.
and
it
may
well
have
some
literary,
artistic,
scientific,
or
political
value--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--although
this
kind
of
pornographic
material,
i
think,
probably
hadn't...
certainly
does
not
meet
the
last
of
those
criteria.
but
the
prurient
appeal
definition
that
this
court
elaborated
in
brockett
against
spokane,
we
think,
narrows
the
range
of
even
sexually
explicit
material
that
is
covered
by
obscenity.
so
it
is
entirely
possible
that
there
is
a
fair
volume
of
indecent
material
that
would
not
rise
to
the
level
of
obscenity
because
the
prurient
appeal
definition
of
brock...
of
brock
might
not
be
met.
but
the
short
answer
to
your
question
about
the
factual
record
is
that
we
simply
don't
know
of
the
millions
and
the
tens
of
millions
of
calls
made
each
year,
what
percentage
of
those
would
be
obscene,
what
percentage
would
be
indecent,
and
what
percentage
would
be
neither
obscene
nor
indecent.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
no,
not
in
the
statute
itself,
but--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
we
think
that
the
legislative
history
makes
it
quite
clear
that
congress
was
looking
at
both
miller
and
at
pacifica
when
it
was
using
those
terms.
there
are
various
memoranda
of
law
in
the
congressional
record.
and
i
don't
think
it--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--there
are
no
committee
reports
for
this
legislation.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
it
was
prepared
by,
i
think,
citizens
for
decency
through
law,
and
put
into
the
congressional
record
by
the
principal
sponsors--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
i
think
that
is
a
fair
assumption
in
this
case,
because
all
of
the
sponsors
of
the
legislation
repeatedly
referred
to
both
the
memorandum
and
to
pacifica
and
to
miller.
there
was,
as
far
as
i'm
aware,
no
dispute--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--yes,
in
the
debates
on
the
floor.
the
bills
that
are...
that
became
this
law
did
not
make
it
through
committee.
they
were
introduced
as
amendments.
they
were
introduced
on
the
floor
and
voted
on,
on
the
floor,
in
the
house
separately,
and
then
as
an
amendment
to
a
larger
education
bill.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
there
was
no
disputing,
within
congress,
what
the
definition
of
indecency
was
or
obscenity.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
even
without
legislative
history,
it
seems
to
me
the
fairest
assumption,
when
congress
used
the
term
indecency,
is
to
look
to
what
this
court
had...
had
said,
and
this
court's
case
on
indecency
in
pacifica.
and
there,
both
the
commission
in
that
case
and
in
numerous
subsequent
administrative
proceedings,
has
adhered
to
a
standard
definition
of
patently
offensive
sexual
speech.
i
would
like
to
explain
the
background
of
section
223
(b),
because
that
background
is
important
to
understanding
both
the
aims
of
the
statute
and
why
the
statute
is
no
broader
than
necessary
to
achieve
those
aims.
the
telephone
pornography
industry
was
born
in
1983.
as
a
result
of
newly
available
technology,
providers
of
pre-recorded,
sexually-explicit
messages,
like
sable,
could
disseminate
those
messages
on
special,
976
lines
to
thousands
of
callers
simultaneously,
and
to
hundreds
of
thousands
of
callers
a
day.
the
providers
of
this
so-called
dial-a-porn
use
the
telephone
companies
to
do
their
billing.
the
telephone
company
collects
a
special
charge
per
minute
or
per
call
and
pays
the
provider
a
share.
the
market
for
sexual
telephone
messages
grew
rapidly.
in
1984,
180
million
calls
were
made
to
dial-a-porn
in
new
york
alone.
by
1988
the
industry
was
estimated
to
gross
more
than
$2
billion
a
year.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
it
is
my
understanding
that
each
of
the
telephone
companies
is,
as
part
of
its
non-discrimination
obligation,
required
to
accept...
accept
these.
but
i
can't
say
with
certainty
whether
that's
so
in
each
state.
i
know
of
no
state
which...
in
which
a
telephone
company
has
refused
to
accept
these,
and
has
been
upheld
in
doing
so.
from
the
beginning
of
this
new
industry
it
was
clear
that
children
had
ready
access
to
dial-a-porn,
and
that
the
messages
contained
a
wide
range
of
graphic
descriptions
of
sexual
acts,
many
of
those
acts
involving
minors.
in
1983
congress
enacted
the
first
version
of
section
223(b)
to
attack
the
problem.
the
statute
banned
obscene
and
indecent
commercial
telephone
communications
to
minors.
it
directed
the
fcc
to
devise
regulations
that
would
try
to
separate
adults
from
minors
in
the
calling
audience.
and
it
provided
that
compliance
with
such
regulations
would
be
a
defense
under
the
statute.
the
fcc
then
undertook
a
four-year
effort
to
promulgate
regulations
that
would
accommodate
congress'
competing
goals,
to
try
to
prevent
access
by
minors
while
not
unduly
restricting
adults'
access
to
dial-a-porn.
the
commission
first
proposed
a
defense
based
either
on
use
of
a
credit
card
to
pay
for
the
call,
which
was
not
feasible
for
pre-recorded
telephone
messages,
or
on
restriction
of
the
messages
to
evening
and...
and
night-time
hours.
in
the
challenge
brought
by
sable's
affiliate,
carlin,
the
second
circuit
invalidated
the
time-of-day
restriction
as
essentially
ineffective,
noting
how
little
time
it
took
for
a
minor
to
make
a
call,
and
the
availability
of
dial-a-porn
by
long-distance
calls
to
other
time
zones.
on
remand
the
commission
added
a
second
defense
based
on
the
dial-a-porn
providers
requiring
callers
to
punch
in
an
access
code
to
hear
the
message.
based
on
comments
from
carlin
and
others,
carlin,
in
fact,
stated
children
intent
on
acquiring
a
code
will
certainly
be
able
to
do
so.
the
commission
recognized
the
problem
that
minors
might
obtain
access
codes.
and
the
commission,
therefore,
required
that
access
codes
be
made
available
only
through
the
mail
and
cancelled
upon
notification
of
improper
use.
in
the
same
proceeding,
the
commission
also
rejected
various
kinds
of
blocking
as
technologically
infeasible,
unduly
expensive,
over-inclusive
in
their
impact
on
non-sexual
976
telephone
messages,
and
ineffective
in
preventing
minors'
access.
after
another
court
challenge
by
sable's
affiliate
and
another
remand
from
that
challenge,
the
commission
promulgated
a
third
set
of
regulations,
adding
a
third
defense
based
on
the
providers
scrambling
of
its
messages.
once
scrambled,
the
message
could
be
de-scrambled
by
a
simple
$15
to
$20,
pocketwatch-size
device
held
up
to
or
attached
to
the
earpiece
on
the
phone.
again,
based
on
comments
submitted
in
the
administrative
proceeding
and
reiterated
by
sable
in
its
challenge
in
the
second
circuit,
the
commission
recognized
that
minors
might
be
able
to
obtain
de-scramblers,
as
it
previously
recognized
with
respect
to
access
codes.
in
the
end,
though,
the
commission
came
to
rest
on
the
three
defenses,
requiring
credit
card
payment,
access
codes
or
scrambling,
as
the
best,
available
implementation--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
i
think
that...
that
the
commission
was
operating
throughout
that
four-year
period
not...
with...
a
single-minded
mandate
to
prevent
minors'
access--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--i'm...
i'm
not
sure
exactly
what
quote
you're
referring
to.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
believe
that...
that
the
commission
was
stating
a
conclusion
about
the
effectiveness
of
reaching
an
inherently
compromised
goal,
a
goal
that
said,
keep
children
out,
but
make
sure
adults
can...
can
continue
to
gain
access
to
the
material.
and
i
think
all
of
its
rulings
in
the
first,
second
and
third
reports,
in
order,
need
to
be
read
with
that
goal
in
mind.
the
commission
was
not
looking
for
the
single,
most
effective
method
of
keeping
children...
but
preventing
unsupervised
access
by
children.
it
always
had
in
mind
the
competing
congressional
goal
of
ensuring
that
adults
could...
could
continue
to
have
access.
so
it
may
well
be
that
the
commission
did,
at
various
points,
state,
at
least
with
respect
to
credit
cards,
although
there
it
was
talking
only
about
live
calls,
that
that
would
be
an
effective
way
of
preventing
children's
access.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
again,
i
think...
i
think
that
the
commission
was
drawing
a...
a
conclusion
about
effectiveness
as
to
an
inherently
limited
goal.
and
indeed,
the
commission
recognized
that
each
of
its
three
proceedings,
based
on
comments
by
carlin
and
sable
and
the
telephone
companies,
that
there
were
significant
loopholes
in
each
of
the...
in
each
of
the...
the
options.
credit
cards,
it--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--no,
i
think
it
was
the...
the
goal
was
limited
by
the
dual
congressional
command
in
1983
to
keep
this...
this
material
available
on
the
phones
to
adults,
but
try
to
keep
children
from
gaining
access.
as
long
as
one
had
the
first
part
of
the
congressional
command
in
place,
it
was
never
the
commission's
focus
to
looks
for
effective
technological
alternatives,
only
to
get
at
the
second
goal.
because
congress...
it
understood
congress
to
say,
don't
do
anything
unduly
to
restrict
adults'
access.
and
i
think
it's
in
that...
against
that
background
that,
really,
all
of
the
commission's
conclusions
need
to
be...
need
to
be
understood.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
the--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--yes,
there
is...
we
have
not
disputed,
and
congress,
itself,
did
not
differ
with
the
conclusion
that
non-obscene
speech
is
within
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
ban
has
an
impact
on
adults'
access
to--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
we
have
argued
that...
that
this
statute
does,
in
fact,
meet
that
standard
under,
at
least,
the
plurality
opinion
in
pacifica,
it
may
well
be
that
some
laxer
standard
may
be
appropriate.
now,
we
have
not
pressed
that...
that
standard.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
no,
pacifica--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--pacifica
does
not
go
that
far.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
pacifica
noted
the
limits
on
its
opinion.
pacifica,
however
also
did
not
say
that...
say
that
it
was
going
this
far
and
no
further.
it
said
that,
given
the
distinctive
problems
concerning
broadcasting,
the
access
of
children,
the
pervasiveness
of
it,
the
inability
to
separate
adults
from
children
within
the
audience,
that
the
particular
measure
before
it
was
justified.
what
we
are
asking
today
is...
is
to
support...
is...
is
for
this
court
to
uphold
this
telephone
indecency
ban
based
on
the
same
considerations
that
led
the
court
in
pacifica
to
uphold
what
was
concededly
a
more
limited
measure
in...
in...
in
that
case.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
don't...
i
don't
mean
to
be...
to...
to
evade
that.
it
depends
what
one
means
by
reasonably
effective.
again,
the
commission,
every
time
it
stated
a
conclusion
about
effectiveness,
had
in
mind
effectiveness
concerning
a...
a
dual
goal:
two
pieces
of
a
congressional
command
that
were--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--no,
i...
i
don't
think
that
the
commission's
conclusions,
as
a
whole,
can
be
taken
to
establish
the
proposition
that
children
would
all
but
be
kept
from...
from
gaining
unsupervised
access.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes.
i
think...
i
think
the
commission
did...
did
do
that.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
congress...
i'm
not
sure
congress
disagreed
with
the--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--commission's
conclusions.
if...
if
you
read
the
commission's
conclusion--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--that
way,
then
congress
did
disagree.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
that's
not
good
enough.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes,
i
think
that...
that
would
be
one
reading
of
the
record.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
the...
the
child
protection
purpose?
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
we...
we
have
not
defended,
and
congress,
i
don't
think
even
enacted
the
statute
on
any
ground
except
the
prevention
of
unsupervised
access--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--the
indecency
part
of
the
statute,
that's
correct.
not
the
obscenity.
the
obscenity
part
is
different.
but
as
to
the
indecency,
we
have
not
suggested
that
that
statute
can
be
upheld
on--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--no,
the
text
of
the
statute
doesn't...
doesn't
contain
a
statement
of
purpose--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--the...
the
measure
be
fore
this
court
doesn't
impose
that
obligation.
i
understood
your
question
to...
to
be
whether
this
particular
measure
could
be
justified,
whatever
other
statutes
are...
are
on
the
books,
by--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
this...
this
measure
applies
to
the
message
providers
themselves.
this...
this
statute
doesn't
speak
directly
to
the...
the
common
carriers.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
that's
right.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
if...
if
there
is
a
concern--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--perhaps
another
statute
could
relieve
common
carriers
of
that
obligation.
this
statute
simply
prohibits
the
message
providers
from
disseminating
this...
this
information.
and...
and
we
have
not
defended
that
statute
on
the
ground
that
adults...
that
it...
that
it's
justified
as
a
means
of
somehow
protecting
adults.
because
adults
do,
after
all,
have
the
presumed
capacity
to
decide
whether
they
want
to
pick
up
the
phone
and
call.
what's
different
about
children
is
that
congress
can
quite
legitimately
say,
even
a
voluntary
call
by
a
minor
is
not...
is
not
something
that...
that
we
want
to
turn
a
blind
eye
to.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
that...
that
is
true,
as
far
as
i
know
under...
under
current
law.
that,
i
think,
is
a
problem
that,
if
i'm
wrong
about...
if
i'm
right
about
what...
what
current
law
is,
could
be...
might
well
be
addressable
in...
in
another
statute.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
it
would
certainly
be
harder
case
if...
if
the
facts
presented
were
a
choice
between
a
ban
that
made
sure
no
minors
got
access,
and
a
handful.
i
think
we
would
then...
we
then...
we
would
then
have
questions
like
those
that
arise...
that
arose
in
time,
place
and
manner
cases,
like
community
for
creative
non-violence,
where
the
question
was,
just
how
far
can
the
park
service
go
in...
in,
you
know,
in
keeping
a
park...
preserving
a
park
for
specified
uses.
this
record,
i
think,
quite
amply
justifies
the
conclusion
that
we
don't
have
a
choice
between
a
near-perfect
and
a
perfect
measure.
the
ability
to
gain
credit
card
number,
to
gain
an
access
code,
to
gain
a...
a
de-scrambler--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--i
think
that...
that
is
certainly
true,
that...
that
the
older
minors
get,
the
more
resourceful
they
can
get,
the
more
freedom
they
have,
the
more
time
they
have
unsupervised
from
their
parents.
but--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--no,
because--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
in...
in
the
1983
statute,
congress
old
use
the
term
minor,
and
i
assume
used
in...
in
the
normal
sense
of
18
or
under.
in
the
current
statute
there
is
no
reference
to
minors.
the
question
is,
we're
talking
about
minors
because
of
the
congressional
concern.
that
concern
surely
is
of
diminished
force
as...
as
we
are
talking
about
17...
17-year-olds.
but
children
from
5,
6,
8,
10--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--have
access
to
telephones
and
know
how
to
use--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
not...
not
as
easily.
but
i
think
that...
that
children
of
age
1o
or
11,
as
indeed
the
anecdotal
evidence
submitted
to
congress
and
the
commission
show,
have
shown
a
very
strong
interest
in
calling
up
these
dial-a-porn
services
and
getting
a
three
or
four-digit
access
code,
or
getting
a
credit
card
number,
or
picking
up
a
small
de-scrambler
that
just
needs
to
be
held
up
to
the
earpiece
of
a
telephone,
is,
we
think,
not
a...
a
very
difficult
measure
for...
for
children.
and,
indeed,
sable
and
its
affiliates
have,
throughout
the
administrative
proceedings,
urged
the
proposition
that
these
measures
are,
in
fact,
ineffective,
that
children
would
be
able
to...
to
circumvent...
easily
circumvent
all
of
these
measures.
so
we
think
that...
that
it
was
well
within
congress'
usual
range
of
fact-finding
discretion
to
determine
that
the
loopholes
left
by
various
technological
alternatives
were
very
substantial
loopholes,
and
that
we
weren't
just
talking
about
a
handful
of
minors,
monthly
or
annually,
who
would
be
able
to
gain
access,
but
a
very
significant
number.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
there
are
no...
there
are
no
studies.
the...
one
reason,
i
suspect,
is
that
the
most
obvious
means
of
gaining
statistical
information
would
be
a
survey,
and,
in
part,
because
of
embarrassment
and
other
factors,
that
might
be
very
unreliable
information.
there
have,
over
the
years,
been
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
complaints
made,
informal
and
formal,
to
the
commission,
to
state
agencies,
to
members
of
congress--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--no,
i'm
referring
to--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--adults
complaining
about
their
children's
access.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
let
me
say
one...
one
quick
word
about
the
obscenity
portion
of
the
case.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes.
there
are
some
extremely
lurid
consequences
of...
of
this...
of
this
telephone
pornography.
let
me
just
say
one
word
about
the
obscenity
challenge.
we
think
it
is
a
sufficient
answer
that
this
is
a
facial
challenge,
and
that
sable's
objection
to
the
obscenity
portion
is
not
that
obscenity
is
protected,
but
that
speech
that
is
not
obscene
in
los
angeles
might
be
disseminated
in
some
other
community
where
it
is
obscene.
it
is
a
sufficient
answer,
i
think,
to
that
challenge,
just
to
note
that
the...
the
statute
is
clearly
capable
of
constitutional
application...
or
prosecution
in
los
angeles,
even
under
sable's
view
of...
of
the
statute,
and
that
no
other
party
is
differently
situated.
and
so
under
taxpayers
for
vincent
and
other
cases,
there
is
no
third
party
overbreadth
claim
here.
any
challenge
that
sable
has
regarding
its...
the
obscenity
portion
should
and
must
be
raised
only,
in
an
as-applied
challenge.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
just
a
couple
of
brief
points
that
i
think
focus
on
the
heart
of...
of
our
dispute.
first
of
all,
it
cannot
be
consistent
with
what
this
court
held
in
ginsberg
and
reiterated
in
pacifica,
that
the
point
of
sale
is
simply
irrelevant
to
the
inquiry.
if
congressional
and
state
legislative-concern
ended
with
the
proposition
that
minors
can
through
a
variety
of
means,
pick
up
copies
of
playboy
magazine
in
their
friends'
houses,
or
what
have
you
then
the
whole
proposition
and
ruling
of
ginsberg
would
be
defeated.
the
point
of...
the
significance
of
the
point
of
sale
is
that
it
represents,
in
most
cases,
a
very
reliable
opportunity
to
make
sure
that
minors
are
screened
from
the
audience.
what
is
distinctive
about
the
telephone
mediums
as
was
distinctive
about
the
broadcasting
mediums
is
that
that
is
simply
not
possible.
one...
one
additional
point,
and
that
is,
we
think
it
is,
at
the
very
least,
important
in
focusing,
then,
on
whether
congress
did
adopt
the
less
restrictive
alternative,
in
addition
to
giving
deference
to
congress'
and
the
commission's
judgement
about
precisely
what
kind
of
access
children
would
have,
to
ensure
that...
that
we
don't...
that
the
court
does
not
strike
down
a
ban
on
the
strength
o
a
less
restrictive
alternative
that
the
second
circuit
found
unconstitutional
in
carlin
iii,
and
that
sable,
itself,
would
continue
to
challenge
as
unconstitutional.
thank
you.
