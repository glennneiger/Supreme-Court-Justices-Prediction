justice
white
you
think
they...
you
think
that...
that
the
commission
did,
though,
decide
they
had
done
as
well
as
they
could?
justice
white
and...
and
ever
even
if
they...
even
if
they
thought
it
was
reasonably
effective,
as
justice
kennedy
says,
congress
apparently
disagreed
with
them?
justice
white
i
mean
they
would--
justice
white
--yes,
exactly.
justice
white
and
if
they
said
this...
and
if
they
said,
well,
this
is
as
well
as
we
can
do--
justice
white
--congress
said
that
wasn't
good
enough.
justice
white
i
take
it
then,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
to
your
argument
if
the...
if
the...
if
the
commission
had
found
that
there
is
just
no
technologically
feasible
way
of
keeping
this
away
from
children
at
all?
justice
white
well,
i...
i
know,
but
my
question--
justice
white
--let's
just
suppose
that
the
commission
had
found
that...
that
there
is
just
no
way
of
really
keeping
this
away
from...
it
just
won't
be
just
a
few,
but
practically
any
child
that
wants
to
can
get
to
this.
justice
white
i
would
think
your
argument
would
still
be
the
same.
justice
white
well,
so...
so
if
there
weren't...
if
there
weren't
a
less
restrictive
alternative,
you
would
think
the
law
would
be
all
right?
justice
white
so
how
do
you
decipher
what
congress
did.
justice
white
i
didn't
say
it
was
hard,
i
just
wanted
to
hear
what
you
had
to
say
about
it.
[laughter]
justice
white
well,
that's
fine.
but
what
do
you
think
they...
what
do
you
think
they
had
in...
what
do
you
think
they
tried
to
do,
to
make
it
absolutely...
to
achieve
the
impossible
goal
of...
of
ensuring
that
no
child
ever--
justice
white
--they
didn't
care
whether
it
was
one
child
or
1,000
who
could...
is
that
it?
justice
white
well,
did
the...
did
the--
justice
white
--did
they...
did
they
seek
the
views
of
the
communications
commission
with
respect
to
this
particular
piece
of
legislation?
and
what
did
they--
justice
white
--what
did
they
say?
did
they...
they
recommend
that
it
be
passed?
justice
white
well...
well,
they
said--
justice
white
--what...
what
was
their
view
of
the...
when
they
presented
their
views,
they
said
it
might
be
unconstitutional,
but
what
about
how...
how...
how...
how
safe
was...
did
they
say
that...
that
there
is
a...
there
is
a...
a
reasonably
effective
way
of
doing
this?
justice
white
and...
and
did
they
testify
before
the
committee...
the
committee...
the--
justice
white
--and
did
they
explain
what
they
thought
reasonably
effective
was?
justice
white
are,
you
going
to
argue
the--
justice
white
--obscenity
case?
justice
white
about
to
try
to.
all
right.
justice
white
the
big
chill?
