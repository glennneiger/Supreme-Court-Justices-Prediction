justice
kennedy
well...
well,
you
say
inherently
limited
goal.
it's
limited
by
the
compelling
interest
that
the
state
itself
hypothesizes
at
the
outset.
justice
kennedy
well,
just
before...
before
we
leave
this
and
beginning
with
justice
o'connor's
initial
inquiry,
can
we
interpret
this
record
fairly
as
saying
that
the
administrative
agency
made
a
determination
that
blocking
and
access
codes
were
reasonably
effective
to
deter
use
by
minors?
justice
kennedy
well,
i'm
talking
about...
i'm
talking
about
the
one
goal
of
limiting
access
for
minors,
as
to
indecent
messages.
justice
kennedy
so--
--does
your
client
take
a
position
that
the
telephone
companies
are
common
carriers
that
must
be
required--
justice
kennedy
--to
carry
these
messages?
justice
kennedy
--but
i...
we
can
say
that
it's
not
settled,
either
from
the
standpoint
of
the
policy
of
your
client,
or
by
a
definitive
decision
of
this
court
that
the
carrier
is
not
going
to
be
told
that
it's
required
to
carry
the
messages?
justice
kennedy
but...
but...
but
before
we
leave
that--
justice
kennedy
--would
it
be
constitutional
for
congress
to
pass
a
statute
saying
that
common
carriers
can
refuse
to
carry
any
commercial
message
they
choose?
justice
kennedy
and...
and
if...
if
that
statute
is...
is
not
constitutional,
then
we
are
right
back
to
this
question,
because
the
next
question
could
be,
would
a
statute
be
permissible
allowing
the
option
to
the
company
to
refuse
indecent
calls.
justice
kennedy
did...
does
sable
agree
with
that
position?
justice
kennedy
and
does
it
agree
that
that
it's
a
legitimate
regulation?
justice
kennedy
well,
i'm
still
not
sure
of
the
answer.
does...
does
sable
agree
that
some,
or
all
of
these
devices
in
combination,
are
legitimate?
