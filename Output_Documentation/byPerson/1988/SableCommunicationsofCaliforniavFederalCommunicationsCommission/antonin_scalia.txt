justice
scalia
mr.
taranto,
do
we
no
which
is
which
here,
i
mean,
of...
of
the
calls
that
are
really
the
money-making
part
of
this
operation?
is
it
your
view
that
they
come
within
the
obscenity
provision?
justice
scalia
well,
how...
how
would
one
judge?
i
mean,
let's
say
the...
the
calls
that
consist
of
a
woman
describing
sexual
activity,
would
you
consider
that
to
be
obscene,
or
just
a
good,
healthy
interest
in
sex--
justice
scalia
--well,
is--
justice
scalia
mr.
taranto,
let's
talk
about
if...
if
the
child
protection
portion
of
it
is
no
good,
do
you
concede
that
the
whole
thing
is
bad,
then?
justice
scalia
yes,
let's
assume
that
that
child
protection
purpose
is...
is
not
served,
or
could
be
served
in
a
different
fashion.
justice
scalia
and
that's
the
only
ground
on
which
we
can
uphold
it?
well,
that...
that
part
of
the
statute.
justice
scalia
does
the
text
of
the
statute
say
that
that's
the
only
basis
for...
for
the
indecency
portion?
justice
scalia
indeed,
what...
what
affects
me
is
what
you
say
about
whether
phone
companies
have
to
carry
this
stuff.
we're
talking
here
about
pornography
that
is
just
short
of
obscenity.
and
in
the
ordinary
world,
responsible
individuals
can
exercise
judgment
about
whether
they
want
to
lower
the
tone
of
society
by
making
that
material
available
to
adults
or
to
children:
the
local
grocery
store,
even
the
local
broadcaster,
because
they
are
not
common
carriers.
but
here
you're
talking
about
a
government
that
imposes
an
obligation
to
carry
this
stuff
nationwide,
and
there
is
no
individual
that
can
exercise
the
judgment
to
say
this
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
ought
to
be
generally
available
in
the
community--
justice
scalia
--instead
of
just
downing
one
sector
by
zoning,
or
something
of
that
sort.
don't
you
think
that
makes
it
quite
different
from...
from
some
other
areas
of...
of
whether
pornography
can
generally
be
available?
justice
scalia
this
measure
applies
only
to
common
carriers,
doesn't
it?
justice
scalia
yes,
but
the
message
provider
is
providing
the
message
on
common
carrier
facilities--
justice
scalia
--who
must
carry
it.
so
that
there
is
nobody
who
has
any
say
as
to
whether
that
goes
into
every
community
in
the
country;
indeed,
into
every
home
in
the
country.
justice
scalia
if
they
have
a
public
service
obligation,
the
common
carriers.
justice
scalia
adults
have
the
capacity
to
turn
off
a
television
set,
too,
but
most
broadcasters
and
most
sponsors,
who
have
the
power
to
make
the
judgment
about
whether
they're
going
to
carry
pornography
just
short
of...
just
short
of
obscenity
won't
do
it.
so
there
is
somebody
other
than
the
man
who's
making
money
on
it,
who
can
control
it.
and
you're
telling
me
this
is
a
situation
where,
as
far
as
you
know,
there
isn't
anybody
under
current
law.
justice
scalia
including
an
amicus
here,
whose...
whose
daughter
was
raped
by
a...
by
a
12-year-old
after
he--
justice
scalia
--had
talked
on
the
phone
for
two-and-a-half
hours
to
one
of
these.
justice
scalia
well,
but,
are
we
talking
the
long-lines
companies
or
just
the
local
companies?
justice
scalia
sure--
justice
scalia
well,
unless
you
want
to
say
this
approach
is...
is
like
the
first
approach,
it...
it...
it
says
you
can
do
it,
but
not
in
this
place.
that
is,
not
on
these
common
carrier
lines.
justice
scalia
you
can
do
it
by
cassettes,
you
can
do
it
by
other
modes,
just
not
by
telephone.
justice
scalia
why
is
that
different,
in
kind,
from
the
first
approach?
justice
scalia
how
about
the
fact
that
it's
in
my
home,
for
one
thing?
i
can
keep
my
kids
out
of
the
movie,
but
i
can't
keep
them
out
of
my
home.
and
the
phone
is
right
there
whenever
they
want
to
use
it.
justice
scalia
but
what
about
the
impact
on
the
child?
the
printed
word
is...
is
less...
less
likely
to
be
attractive
and
harmful;
pictures,
more
so;
the
live
human
voice,
it
would
seem
to
me,
more
so
still.
and
i'm
sure,
right
around
the
corner
with
fiber
optics
is...
is
these
services
with
video
on
telephone
lines.
justice
scalia
is
there
no
distinction
that
can
be
based
upon
the
degree
of
harm
that...
that
even
letting
a
few
children
slip
under...
under
the
wire
can
cause?
justice
scalia
i
agree
with
that.
i
think--
justice
scalia
--well--
justice
scalia
--i'll
take
that.
that...
that's
still
better
than
the
printed
word,
i
would
think--
justice
scalia
--as...
as
far
as
its
impact
upon
the
juvenile
is
concerned.
justice
scalia
can
i
come
back
to
your...
your
point
about,
you
know,
now
much
really
important
stuff
is
covered
by
this?
in
the
second
circuit
case,
carlin
won.
the
court...
the
court
observed
that,
rather
incredibly,
800,000
calls
per
day
were
made
to
dial-a-porn,
your
client's
service,
colloquial...
colloquially
called
dial-a-porn,
in
may,
in
the
one,
month
of
may
1983.
justice
scalia
and
180
million
calls
in
the
year
ending
february
1984.
justice
scalia
now
i
don't
think
they
called
up
to
listen
to
the
carlin
dialogue.
i
really
don't,
i
don't
think
that's
where
the
money
is.
i
don't
think
anybody
thinks
that's
where
the
money
is.
justice
scalia
i
never
believed
that
at
all.
justice
scalia
i
never
believed
it
for
a
minute.
