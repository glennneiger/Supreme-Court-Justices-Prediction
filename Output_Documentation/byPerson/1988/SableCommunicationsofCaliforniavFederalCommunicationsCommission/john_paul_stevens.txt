justice
stevens
--may
i
just
be
sure
of
one
point?
are
either
of
these
terms
defined
in
the
statute?
justice
stevens
how
do
we
know
what
congress
meant
them
to
mean?
justice
stevens
is
there
anything
in
any
of
the
committee
reports
that
describes
this
point?
justice
stevens
how
deeply
into
the
legislative
history
must
we
go
to
find
this
out?
memorandum
of
law
prepared
by
whom?
justice
stevens
and
we're
presuming
that
the
congress
adopted
the
views
of
that
particular
group?
justice
stevens
referred...
referred
in
what
kind
of
context,
in
the
debates
on
the
floor,
or
in
a
hearing--
justice
stevens
--but,
it
is--
justice
stevens
--or
really
no
discussion,
i
suppose,
then.
or
just
a...
sort
of
an
adoption
of
those.
but
we
do...
it
is
clear
we
must
look
to
legislative
history
to
find
out
what
these
terms
mean.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
to
follow
up
on
justice
o'connor's
inquiry
earlier
about
the...
the
commission's
conclusion
about
what
could...
would
reasonably
prevent
access
by
minors?
i
think
when
you...
in
your
phrasing
of
the
point,
you
said
that
there
was
no
way
that
you
could
reliably
prevent
access
by
minors.
you
used
a
little
different
word.
what...
what...
how
many...
how
many
minors
are
we
concerned
about,
if
just
a
handful
get
access,
is
that
enough
to
defend
the
statute,
or
do
you
have
to
have
a
substantial
segment?
and
when
is
a
minor
a
minor,
at
what
age?
justice
stevens
and
see,
those
abilities
are
probably
for
the
older
minors.
the
very
young
minors
probably...
it
would
probably
work
quite
well
as
to...
and
i
guess
as
they
get
closer
to
majority,
they're
also
more
able
to
figure
out
ways
to
get
access
to
this
stuff.
so--
justice
stevens
--what,
for
purposes
of
this...
this...
what...
what
do
we
mean
by
minor
in
your...
well,
what,
did
congress
identify
the
age
that
they
ware
talking
about?
justice
stevens
was
it
under
21,
or
under
14,
or
what?
justice
stevens
but
those
children--
justice
stevens
--have
access
to
telephones,
but
they
probably
couldn't
master
these...
you
know,
they
couldn't
evade
the
restrictions
as
easily,
i
wouldn't
think.
justice
stevens
is
that
number
just
based
on
anecdotal
evidence,
or
are
there
any
studies
in
the
record
to
tell
us--
justice
stevens
--but
those,
i
suppose,
include
complaints
by
adults
who
wouldn't
want
the
material
disseminated
to
adults
either?
justice
stevens
just
children?
justice
stevens
i
see.
