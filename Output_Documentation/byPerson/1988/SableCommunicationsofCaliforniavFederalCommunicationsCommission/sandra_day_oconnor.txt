justice
o'connor
and,
mr.
taranto,
didn't
the
fcc
conclude
that
the...
a
scheme
using
access
codes,
scrambling
and
credit
card
payment,
was
a
feasible
and
effective
way
to
serve
the
states'
compelling
interest
in
protecting
children
from
exposure
to
these
calls?
justice
o'connor
but
didn't
it
reach
that
conclusion
that
i
stated,
fairly?
justice
o'connor
that
it
was
feasible
and
effective
using
those
things
to
meet
the
states'
compelling
interest
in
protecting
children.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
think
that's
a
concern,
if
the
agency
itself
concluded
that
some
more
restrictive
means
of
controlling
this
is
feasible
and
effective,
i
wonder
how
the
total
ban
survives
our
constitutional
test
of
least
restrictive
means.
justice
o'connor
well,
and
i
suppose
it's
more
than
just
a
congressional
concern.
it
may
be
founded,
indeed,
on
a
constitutional
requirement--
justice
o'connor
--that
adult
access
be
considered.
justice
o'connor
so
we
do
have
to
make
the
inquiry
about
whether
this
is
narrowly
tailored
and
the
least
restrictive
method?
justice
o'connor
well,
but,
pacifica
was
certainly
not
a
case
that
can
be
read
to
authorize
a
blanket
ban--
justice
o'connor
--in
a
criminal
context.
justice
o'connor
no.
justice
o'connor
you
have
no
view
on
whether
the
telephone
companies
can
refuse
to
carry
these
messages?
justice
o'connor
mr.
tribe,
what
is
a
blocking
device?
justice
o'connor
well,
the
fcc
never
relied
on
the
use
of
blocking
devices?
justice
o'connor
has
the
technology
changed
since
then,
so
that
is
now
feasible?
justice
o'connor
is
it
correct
mr....
is
it
correct,
mr.
tribe,
that
your
client
has
been
able
to
reach
agreements
now
with
pacific
bell
to
offer
purely
local
service
in
the
los
angeles
area?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
guess
your
client
could
also
hire
people
to
answer
the
phone
calls
and
screen
them
out
from--
justice
o'connor
--yes.
