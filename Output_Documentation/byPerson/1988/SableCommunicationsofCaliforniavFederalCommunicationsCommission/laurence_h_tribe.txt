mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
begin
with
the
question
that
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
asked
mr.
taranto,
and
with
justice
scalla's
follow-up
concern,
because,
until
now,
this
case
has
been
litigated
in
terms
of
the
interest
of
children.
but
i
do
understand
the
question,
mightn't
congress
have
had...
or
mightn't
this
court
in
hindsight
attribute
to
congress,
another
legitimate
purpose,
protecting
common
carriers
from
the
distasteful
obligation
of
carrying
messages
that,
in
some
cases,
as
justice
scalia
suggests,
are
just
short
of
obscene,
although
in
other
cases,
as
with
many
of
the
portions
of
the
carlin
tape,
are
probably
far
short
of
obscene.
that
interest
is
an
important
one,
i
think,
to
examine,
even
if
congress
didn't
have
it
in
mind,
though
i
wouldn't
concede
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
hold
the
law
on
that
basis.
the
fact
is
that
most
courts
have
not
treated
telephone
companies
in
this
context
as
common
carriers.
pacific
bell
has
debated
whether
it
will
carry
these
messages;
for
the
time
being,
it
does.
mountain
state
said
no.
and
the
ninth
circuit,
in
an
opinion
by
judge
sneed,
in
carlin
communication
against
mountain
state,
said
that
when
you
have
these
messages
that
can
reach
lots
of
people
at
once,
the
phone
company
doesn't
have
to
be
treated
as
a
common
carrier.
it
declined
to
construe
state
law
as
requiring
that
pornographic
messages,
even
lawful
ones,
be
carried.
southern
bell
similarly
refused,
and
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
it
didn't
have
to
carry
them.
and
both
circuits
said
there
was
no
state
action.
so
the
premise
that
mr.
taranto
has,
that
perhaps
congress
might
be
upheld
on
another
ground,
i
think
just
can't
be
sustained.
so
we
do
have
to
focus
on
children--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
so.
so
far,
every
circuit
has
said
these
are
not
common
carriers
with
this
general
obligation.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--an
affiliate
of
sable
has
argued
for
that
position
in
other
cases,
but
the
client
i
represent
here
does
not
take
any
position
on
that
matter
in
this
case.
i
really
don't
have
a
view.
i
do
think
that
there
is
a
powerful--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--oh,
i'm
inclined
to
think
that
they
can
refuse,
unless
there
is
some
governmental
pressure
upon
them,
in
which
case
it's
tantamount
to
a
governmental
ban.
indeed,
judge
sneed
did
take
the
position
that
when
they
refuse
under
threat
of
prosecution,
then
the
first
amendment
comes
into
play.
and
that,
of
course,
is
the
focus
of
our
case
today--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--we're
talking
about
the
baby
bells
and
the
other
local
companies.
as
to
the
long-line
companies,
of
course,
if
the
locals
refuse
to
carry,
there'd
be
nothing
to
connect.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
i
suspect
a
similar
proposition
would
be
advanced
with
respect
to
the
long-line
companies.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
not
absolutely
and
authoritatively
settled,
justice
kennedy,
but
i
think
implausible
to
sustain
this
law
on
that
ground,
first,
because
it's
likely
they
wouldn't
be
so
required.
second,
because
that
wasn't
one
of
congress'
reasons.
third,
because
even
if
there
is
some
such
requirement,
that
requirement
is
purely
a
product
of
state
law.
and
for
this
court
to
uphold
a
law
that
outright
bans
and
criminalizes
concededly
protected
speech
in
order
to
hypothetically
protect
some
possible
potential
common
carriers
from
a
state
law
obligation,
seems
something
of
a
stretch.
the
real
issue
here,
i
think,
is
children.
and
whenever
a
category--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--yes.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
an
intriguing
question,
justice
kennedy.
i
suppose,
if
there
were
something
of
a
monopoly,
and
the
impact
of
that
law
was
to
prevent
certain
persons
from
getting
protected
messages
somewhere,
it
would
be
a
little
like
marsh
v.
alabama,
in
which
this
court
held
that
a
private
company
cannot,
in
effect,
be
authorized
by
state
law
to
block
access
of
a
whole
group
of
people
to
a
protected
message.
but
that
would
be
a
difficult
issue
for
another
day,
i
think.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
in
any
event,
that
would
surely
be
a
less
restrictive
alternative
for
congress.
but
if
congress
were
to
say
that
a
company
may
refuse
to
carry
certain
kinds
of
messages,
and
in
that
way
were
to
try
to
relieve
them
of
the
burden,
the
adverse
impact
on
protected
speech
by
message
providers
would
be
considerably
less.
because
it
would
depend
on
a
later
adjudication
of
whether
that
law
was
valid.
with
respect
to
children,
i
think
the
important
and
quite
universally
recognized
point,
and
we
certainly
have
to
concede
it,
is
that
when
a
category
of
speech
is
protected
for
adults
but
might
harm
children,
there
are
not
may
ways
that
government
can
absolutely
rule
out
any
possible
child
access.
there
are
three
broad
approaches
government
can
take.
it
can
try
to
channel
or
zone
the
speech
into
times
and
places
where
parents
can
supervise
exposure.
this
court
authorized,
for
example,
banning
the
sale
of
adult
magazines,
even
not
quite
obscene
ones,
to
minors
in
ginsberg,
in
pacifica.
although
it
certainly
didn't
authorize
outright
criminalization,
it
said
that
one
could
take
a
radio
station's
careless
daytime
broadcast
of
dirty
words
into
account
in
the
licensing
context.
one
could
rely,
as
this
court
said,
one
had
to,
in
bolger,
on
parents
to
intercept
potentially
indecent
condom
ads
at
the
mailbox.
that's
one
approach.
now,
a
second
approach
is
to
screen.
that
is,
one
can
require
that
the
speech,
which
is
unsuitable
for
children,
be
coded
or
scrambled,
or
otherwise
made
accessible
only
to
people
who
have
some
special
information
or
device.
and
then
one
can
make
it
illegal
for
minors
to
obtain
that
device.
you
could
require
lockboxes
on
cable
t.v.,
and,
of
course,
there
is
the
fcc's
1987
approach.
now,
these
two
approaches
aren't
perfect.
children
are
not
chained
to
their
parents.
parents
may
be
busy
or
distracted.
kids
can
go
next
door.
all
locks
and
codes
can
be
broken
by
someone
enterprising
enough.
and
so
it's
tempting
sometimes
to
take
the
next
steps
and
to
ban
the
speech
outright
by
criminal
law
so
that
not
even
willing
adults
can
get
it,
which
is
the
approach
of
this...
of
this
statute.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
not
on
the
telephone.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
understand.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
the
search
for
that
kind
of
limiting
principle
is
important.
because,
i
think,
as
your
question
recognizes,
otherwise
the
government
could
use
a
flat
ban
to
reduce
the
messages
reachable
by
phone
to
those
that
are
fit
for
children.
the
same
rationale,
namely,
some
kid
will
get
through,
could
be
used
to
eliminate
the
sale
of
indecent,
but
not
obscene,
books,
magazines,
films,
videos,
hbos,
and
the
like.
indeed,
much
of
what
is
here
described
as
just
short
of
obscene
is
not
distinguishable
from
a
lot
of
what's
in
r-rated
movies,
and
lots
of
racy
novels.
so
it
is
important
to
ask
whether
there
is
something
distinctive
about
dialing
a
phone
that
would
justify
this
content-based
law,
which
is
certainly
not
narrowly
tailored.
i
mean,
after
all,
most
of
what
it
outlaws
is
an
adult
deliberately
dialing
a
call,
not
being
harassed
by
anyone.
and
so,
let
me...
let
me
turn
to
that.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
the
phone
is
right
in
your
home,
as
is
the
mailbox.
and
if
you
don't
want
the
kids,
if
you
don't
want
the
kids,
as
i
certainly
wouldn't
want
them,
to
dial
these
companies
from
my
phone,
i
wouldn't
buy
a
de-scrambler.
and
the
fcc
takes
that
into
account
when
it
says
we
do
want
to
empower
parents
in
their
homes
to
disarm
the
telephone,
make
it
not
a...
a
vehicle
for
getting
this
kind
of
indecent
speech.
but
this
is
not
a
medium...
call
it
common
carrier
or
anything
else...
that
is
somehow
directed
or
dedicated
to
minors
as
in
a...
like
a
public
school
pa
system
or
an
educational
channel.
and--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
there
are
three
versions
of
it.
there
is
a
central
access
blocking
technique,
which
uses
the
computers
within
the
phone
system,
and
which
is
now
becoming
feasible
just
about
every
place.
there
is
a
device
that
can
be
attached
to
the
phone,
in
which
the
default
position
is
the
message
can
get
through,
but
then
if
you
block,
the
message
can't.
and
there
is
a
de-scrambler,
which
is
what
the
fcc
in
1987
advocated
as
the
thing
making
it
feasible--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no.
no,
it
did
not.
it
relied
instead--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--it
seems
to
have
advanced,
although
the
record
in
this
case
doesn't
tell
us.
the
fcc
did
say
last
april
in
carlin
iii
that
the
combination
of
access
codes,
required
prepayment
by
credit
card
and
scrambled
messages,
so
that
the
default
position
is
that
the
indecent
message
can't
get
through
unless
the
parent
wants
it
to
get
through,
that
that
combination
was,
as
you
indicated,
justice
o'connor,
a
reasonable,
feasible
and
effective
way.
but--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that
it's
reasonably
feasible
and
effective,
absolutely.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
the
decision
in
carlin
iii
raised
one
question
about
that,
that
i
think
i
ought,
in
candor,
to
focus
on.
and
that
is,
the
second
circut
in
carlin
iii
suggested
that
it
is
legitimate
unless
and
until
even
less
restrictive
alternatives
become
available.
and
they
were
talking
primarily
about
a
beep
tone
approach,
under
which
the
default
position
would
be
that
the
message
could
get
through
unless
the
parent
installed,
for
$5
or
so,
and
that
is
now
feasible
i
understand,
a
beep
tone
device
in
the
phone
so
that
it
wouldn't
get
through.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
combination
don't
want
to
be...
i
don't
think
one
should
get
distracted
with
the
technological
wizardry
of
all
this.
the
fundamental
proposition
is
that
there
is
nothing
distinctive
about
phones.
if
anything,
it
cuts
the
other
way.
it's
much
easier
to
police
the
phone,
either
in
your
own
house
or
in
a
neighbor's
house,
than
it
is
to
police
a
kid
looking
in
somebody
else's
closet
for
old
copies
of
playboy
or
old
centerfold,
or
turning
on
the
hbo.
at
least
some
parent
is
going
to
have
a
monthly
bill
from
sable
or
carlin...
actually,
from
the
phone
company,
indicating
use
of
a
service
by
sable
or
carlin.
so
there
is
a
policing
mechanism.
justice
scalia--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--yes.
certainly,
as
a
less
restrictive
alternative
than
a
flat
ban.
it
agrees
that
they
are
legitimate
unless
and
until
a
less
restrictive
alternative,
still,
becomes
available.
but
certainly,
their
availability
makes
this
flat
ban
illegitimate.
let
me
return
to
justice
scalla's
question
about
the
terrible...
the
rape
of
that
12-year-old.
some
of
the
stuff,
which
is
either
obscene
or
not
obscene,
in
any
medium,
night
be
associated
with
terrible,
terrible
tragedy.
that
isn't,
i
think,
denied.
the
question
really
is
can
one,
as
a
result,
in
dealing
with
non-obscene
material
which
the
government
admits
is
protected
for
adults,
wipe
it
out
from
the
whole
medium
on
the
theory
that
it's
somehow
distinctive.
the
fact
is,
if
you
can
do
it
to
the
telephone,
you
can
do
it
to
pictures
of
nudity
or
violence
that
are
not
suitable
for
minors,
that
might
give
them
terrible
ideas,
but
that
are
protected
for
adults.
they
can
be
every
bit
as
tempting
and
corrupting
for
children,
both
in
print
and
on
film.
there
are
other
suggestions
the
government
makes
for
somehow
trying
to
limit
the
precedent
that
think
it
realizes
could
be
terribly
dangerous.
they
suggest
repeatedly
in
their
brief
that
what's
distinctive
about
the
phone
in
your
home,
to
which
you
referred,
justice
scalla,
is
that
it
is
somehow
immune
to
control
for
age
at
the
point
of
sale.
that
is,
unlike
the
neighborhood
magazine
store
or
the
neighborhood
movie
theater,
where
there
is
somebody
in
the
window
and
where,
unless
you're
pretty
close
to
18,
you
can't
very
well
pass
for
18,
though
you
can
sneak
in,
the
government
says
that
there's
no
live
vendor
at
the
telephone,
and
therefore
no
check
at
the
point
of
sale.
and
therefore,
it's
distinctive.
and
we
could,
therefore,
justify
a
sort
of
limited
ruling
saying
that
on
the
telephone
you
can
reduce
adults
to
what
is
suitable
for
minors.
i
think
that
that's
quite
a
canard.
i
mean,
the
fact
is
that
the
fcc's
safeguards,
the
combination
of
requiring
a
credit
card
or
an
access
code,
or
scrambling
the
message,
would
interpose
live
vendors.
when
you
go
to
get
the
credit
card
or
the
access
code
or
the
de-scrambler.
the
picture
of
the
world
that
is
painted
by
the
government
in
its
brief
is
that
these
children
are
so
enterprising
they
can
steal
their
parents'
credit
cards,
they
can
sneak
into
someplace
and
buy
this
de-scrambling
device,
but
somehow,
despite
that,
they're
not
going
to
manage
to
see
the
same
thing
on
adult...
in
adult
magazines
or
somewhere
else.
the
fact
is
you
have
to
buy
an
adult
magazine
even
to
get
the
telephone
number
of
one
of
these
companies.
so
the
idea
that
the
absence
of
a
live
vendor
is
decisive,
i
think,
is
fallacious.
it's
especially
fallacious
since
the
government's
own
argument
shows
that
the
harm
comes
not
from
the
purchase,
but
from
the
peek.
the
harm
is
exposure.
it
doesn't
matters
who
bought
it,
if
the
child
goes
across
the
street
and
looks
at
the
centerfold
at
the
age
of
five
or
six,
or
reads
some
dirty
jokes,
that
can
be
disruptive
of
development
in
exactly
the
same
way.
the
issue,
therefore,
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
vendor,
it
has
to
do
with
the
parent.
and
are
we
going
to
have
government,
basically,
displace
parents,
because
parents
are
not...
are
not
perfect?
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but,
justice
scalia--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--there
are
two
points,
justice
scalia.
the
first
is
that
no
system
will
prevent
some
slippage
under
the
wire
unless
we
take
the
draconian
step
of
completely
blanking
out
protected
speech.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
the
second
proposition,
however,
is
that
this
is
not
a
live
voice.
the
government
makes
a
special
point
of
saying
that
live,
two-way
conversations
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
this
is
a
recorded
voice;
it's
an
answering
machine.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
and
certainly
a
tape
or
a
record
or
a
video--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--but
does
it
matter
whether
it
comes
into
your
ear
through
the
telephone
or
through
the
air
in
front
of
you
when
you
put
it
on
a
record
player
or
a
tape
recording?
are
we
now
going
to
say,
as
it
would
follow
from
that
question,
i
think,
that
if
a
record
or
a
tape
contains
suggestive
or
salacious
language,
or
is
somehow
erotic,
though
not
obscene,
it
certainly
would
be
disruptive
for
a
five-year-old
or
a
10-year-old
to
hear,
that
we
can't
sell
it?
because
if
you
sell
it
down
the
street,
some
15-year-old
may
buy
it,
and
the
five-year-old
may
borrow
it.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
an
illimitable
position,
profoundly
dangerous
to
the
first
amendment.
i
understand
the
temptation
of
it
because
the
stuff
may
not
seem
terribly
edifying.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
justice
white,
i
think
it
would
depend,
and
in
this
i
agree
with
mr.
taranto,
on
what
was
meant
by
no
feasible
way.
that
is,
take
skywriting,
they
use
an
example--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--yeah.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
yes--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
i
think
the
compelling
interest
in
protecting
children
leads,
as
justice
o'connor
says,
to
a
requirement
of
narrow
tailoring.
and
that
leads
to
an
inquiry
of
whether
there
really
is
a
less
restrictive
alternative.
and
in
the
rare
case
where
there
is
just
no
way--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--it
might
well
be
all
right
if
large
numbers
of
children
could,
in
any
event,
get
a
hold
of
it
i
was
about
to
give
the
example
of
skywriting.
there
are
some
things
that,
just
by
the
nature
of
it,
when
they're
up
there,
everybody
can
equally
see
them.
and
you
can't
filter
out
some
people.
but
it
is
simply
fallacious
to
suggest,
as
the
government
does,
that
we're
dealing
here
with
anything
remotely
of
that
sort.
that
is,
all
of
the
evidence
about
the
hundreds
of
calls
that
came
in,
came
from
a
period
when
there
were
no
fcc
safeguards
in
place.
the
primary
quotation
they
rely
on
in
their
brief
is
from
brent
ward,
u.s.
attorney
in
utah.
and
he
said
that
there
were
hundreds
of
calls
from
parents
of
minors
who
complained
to
carlin's
new
york
city
telephone
service.
but
those
calls
occurred
without
any
safeguards
at
all.
and
if
you
ask
what
brent
ward,
their
primary
witness
on
this
subject,
testified
before
congress,
he
said
this,
and
we
quote
him
at
page
9
of
our
brief,
"the
access
code
requirement",
i'm
quoting,
"the
access
code
requirement
and
the
screening
option
would
dramatically
reduce
the
number
of
calls
from
minors,
almost
eliminating
them.
"
"it
would
be
a
very
effective
way
to
do
it.
"
that's
his
language.
now,
the
government
says,
but
that's
only
because
they
have
a
compromised
goal.
the
compromise,
as
justice
o'connor
suggests,
is
with
the
constitution,
with
the
first
amendment.
they
say,
if
you
really
have
an
unalloyed
goal,
then
you
can
say
that
there
is
no
less
restrictive
alternative.
but
the
alloy
that
they
would
remove
is
the
alloy
of
the
first
amendment.
that
is,
quite
clearly,
if
you
give
any
weight
at
all
to
the
importance
of
not
preventing
adults
from
a
medium
ultimately
indistinguishable
from
others,
from
having
access
to
material
that
is
protected
as
to
them,
then
this
is
an
overly
broad
law.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
oh,
i
think
in
an
election
year,
in
1988,
it's
not
too
hard,
justice
white,
if
you
ask
me
that
question
to
decipher
what
congress
did
almost--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
think
this
was...
i
think
this
was
a
politically
popular
measure
to
favor,
politically
devastating
to
oppose,
even
though--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
think
that
what
they--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--they
had
no...
they
were
frustrated,
justice
white,
because
there
was
this
long
colloquy
between
the
relevant
administrative
agency,
the
fcc,
and
the
second
circuit,
lasting
for
about
five
years,
going
back
and
forth.
and
it
was
in
early
april
of
1988
that
the
second
circuit
finally
came
down
in
carlin
iii
and
said,
you've...
you've
done
it
you've
solved
it.
within
days...
within
days
congress
voted
this
flat
ban.
the
hearings
were
held
months
before
carlin
iii
came
down.
so
congress
probably
thought,
if
you
ask
me
to
speculate,
that
the
second
circuit
was
forever
going
to
frustrate
the
fcc
and
that
it
was
just
going
to
cut
through
all
of
the
red
tape,
and
since
it
didn't
value
this
stuff
much
anyway,
and
since
it
thought,
perhaps,
that
it
knew
what
it
was
outlawing,
although,
with
i'm
not
sure
exactly
what
it
was
outlawing,
because
these
terms
are
not
self-defining--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--they
just
said,
let's
go.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
oh,
yes,
they
were
told
by
diane
killory--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--they
recommended
that
it
was
probably
unconstitutional.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
and
that
congress
not
go
at
far.
president
reagan,
when
he
signed
it,
said
i'm
not
so
sure
that
it
will
pass
muster,
but
i'm
going
to
sign
it.
i
do
think,
if
you
ask
what
they
had--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--oh,
yes.
they
concluded
in
their
third
report
in
1987
that
there's
a
reasonably
effective
way
of
doing
it.
and
that
report
was
before
congress
when
it
had
this
law.
and
the
colloquy
wasn't
over
whether
that
would
be
reasonably
effective--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
believe
diane
killory
did,
but
i'm
sure
mr.
taranto
will
have
that
information.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
the...
they,
i
believe,
agreed
with
brent
ward,
that
it
would
almost
eliminate
calls
from
minors.
and
these
are
calls,
i
do
want
to
get
back
to
the
suggestion,
justice
scalia,
that
this
is
just
a
teensy-weensy
bit
short
of
completely
unprotected.
i
don't
think
there's
anything
in
the
record
that...
that
shows
that.
after
all,
the...
the
government
says,
in
page
5
of
its
brief,
that
this
criminalizes
calls
even
when
the...
when
the
message
is
only
suggestive,
not
sexually
explicit,
even
when
there's
no
prurient
appeal
at
all.
and
in
oral
argument,
they
say
that
represents,
they
think,
a
fair
volume.
even
when...
and
they...
to
answer
justice
stevens,
they
go
to
the
pacifica
case
to
say,
well,
what
does
indecent
mean?
of
course,
pacifica
dealt
with,
the
carlin,
"seven
dirty
words"
monologue.
that
wasn't
erotic
in
the
slightest.
it
was,
perhaps,
in
terrible
taste.
it
was
more
funny
than
erotic.
it
might
have
been
gross.
but,
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
heavy
breathing.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
anything
porno...
pornographic
in
the
usual
sense.
the
government
concedes
that
this
ban
applies
even
if
there
maybe
serious
value.
indeed,
as
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
suggest,
one
of
the
commissioners
of
the
fcc
wondered
why
ulysses,
sort
of,
ever
made
it,
because
he
doubted
that
it
had
serious
value.
this
law
is
about
as
broad
as
one
can
imagine.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
believe,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
prior
law
would
have
to
be
re-enacted
to
give
it
that
authority,
though
they
might--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--find
some
more
general
statute.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
believe
it
replaced
the
prior
law
with
the
1988
statute.
but
i'm
sure
that
the
prior
law,
which
was
a
little
bit
like
the
law
of
new
york
in
ginsberg,
it
outlawed
targeting
minors,
and
it
created
a
safe
harbor
if
the
fcc's
regulations
were
complied
with.
i
have
no
doubt
that
they
would
re-enact
that
in
a
minute.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
uh-huh.
it
was
quite
a
fad
at
first.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
actually,
actually,
the
numbers
dropped
off
dramatically.
and
many
people
think
that
jokes
are
the
next
thing,
and
that
people
got
bored
with
those
kinds
of
calls.
but
the
key
points
really,
is
that
if
it
is
protected,
as
the
government
concedes,
judging
what
its
value
might
be,
is
a
treacherous
enterprise
under
the
first
amendment.
one-man's
trash
may
be
another's
solace.
these
poor--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--you
never
believed
that?
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
the
lonely,
bored
person,
afraid
of
getting
aids.
i
mean,
the
fact
is,
justice
scalia,
i,
at
first,
didn't
take
this
as
seriously
as
perhaps
i...
i
should,
but
last
year,
the
national
academy
of
science's
institute
of
medicine
reported
that
stifling
graphic
sexual
materials
may
now
take
a
toll
in
human
lives
in
the
current
period.
the
government
addresses
that.
and
they
said,
well,
we
don't
know
if
it's
true.
if
it's
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
the
default
position,
when
in
doubt
should
be,
don't
suppress.
let
me,
in
the
very
brief
time
i
have
left.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
obscenity.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
was
about
to
try
to
do
that.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
right.
[laughter]
of
course,
the
miller
case,
the
separate,
entirely
separable
obscenity
provision
draws
on
miller,
which
involved
a
mass
mailing
thrust
on
unwilling
people.
and
some
members
of
the
court
would
really,
i
think,
be
understandably
reluctant
to
uphold
an
obscenity
law
where
the
interests
of
unconsenting
adults
are
children
are
otherwise
taken
care
of.
but
the
key
point
about
the
obscenity
provision
is
that
even
if
you
would
otherwise
regard
the
government's
power
of
criminalization
as
broad
enough
to
encompass
obscene
transmission
to
a
consenting
adult
the
government
has
conceded
that
this
law,
because
of
the
discretion
of
the
phone
companies
they
can
invite...
invite
eavesdroppers
from
salt
lake
city
on
calls
meant
only
to
los
angeles.
this
law
puts
pressure
on
the
companies
to
leave
on
the
cutting
room
floor
protected
material...
protected
in
the
community
where
it
is
targeted,
in
order
to
avoid
prosecution.
and
their
whole
answer
is,
hey,
you
don't
need
to
challenge
it
now;
wait
till
you're
prosecuted.
the
law
is
capable
of
valid
application.
that's
a
completely
non-responsive
argument.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it's
the
very
big
chill.
[laughter]
and
it's
not
just
an
overbreadth
challenges,
this
is...
this
operates
like
a
prior
restraint;
it
really
does.
that
is,
what's
left
on
the
cutting
room
floor...
because
otherwise,
someone
will
involuntarily
ship
it
to
salt
lake
city...
will
never
expose
you
to
prosecution.
and
they
have
never
responded
to
that.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
ah,
would
that
it
were
quite
as
true
as
the
government
suggests
at
page
22
of
its
reply
brief.
what
is
correct
is
that
proposed
tariffs
are
in
place
with
the
california
puc.
it's
completely
up
to
pacific
bell
whether
to
live
with
them.
and
their
current
proposal
says,
we
might
do
it,
but
we
will
not
allow
you
to
collect
any
revenue
for
these
local
calls.
well,
that's
not
exactly
a
settlement.
that
is,
they
might
allow
carrying
local
calls,
purely
local,
which
they
would
exclude
from
eavesdropping
from
across
the
country,
but
not
transmit
any
of
the
revenue
generated
thereby
to
sable.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it
could
use
a
completely
live
method
altogether--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--but
i
suppose
you
could
say
of
records
that
people
sell,
they
could
also
use
live
singers.
but
this
is
a
separate,
distinctive
channel
of
communication.
and
the
government's
position,
that
they
can
shrink
it
to
what
is
fit
for
children,
knows
no
limiting
principle
whatever.
and
whatever
one
might
think
of
the
great
or
small
value
of
this
stuff,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
first
amendment
is
in
the
balance
and
that
it
ought
to
prevail.
thank
you.
