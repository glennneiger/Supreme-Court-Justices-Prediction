justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
counsel,
the
government
points
out
that
sections
(a)
and
(c)
apply
to
nonconsensual
liens.
i
suppose
section
(d)
does
also?
i
am
not--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i'm
sorry,
subsection
(a)
of
506--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
(c)
apply
to
nonconsensual
liens?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
about
(d)?
i'm
not--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
believe
it...
so
under
your
view,
only
section
(b)
applies
to
consensual
liens
only.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
how
is
that
different
from
saying
that
only
section
(b)
applies
to
consensual
liens
only?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
understand
that,
but
i
simply
want
to
see
if
it's
correct...
maybe
it
isn't...
that
under
your
view,
the
only
section,
the
only
subsection
in
506
that
applies
exclusively
to
consensual
liens
is
subsection
(b).
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
your
view,
subsection
(b)
applies
only
to
consensual
liens,
correct?
tell
me
if
it's
incorrect.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
and
that's...
and
all
of
the
other
subsections
apply
to
consensual
and
nonconsensual
iiens,
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
now,
that
is
somewhat
of
an
anomalous
statutory
scheme,
is
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
at
the
outset
we
look
at
the
words
of
the
statute,
and
you're
telling
us
that
it's
ambiguous.
certainly
in
the
context
of
the
entire
section
it
seems
that
the
government's
reading
of
the
statute
is
eminently
plausible.
