justice
byron

white
--could
i
ask
you,
this
was
a
reorganization?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think
the
secured
creditor
can
just
stay
out
of
the
reorganization
proceeding
and
foreclose
his
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
can
preserve
his
claim
without
filing,
but
does
that...
does
it
follow
that
he
may
then
foreclose
on
property
that
may
absolutely
frustrate
the
reorganization?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
what
you
say
but
i
don't...
but
that's
different
than
saying
he
may
stay
outside
and
foreclose
his...
foreclose
on
his
security.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
he
may
not
be
able
to
do
it
outside
and
he
has
to...
he
can
preserve
his
claim,
and
the
reorganization...
the
reorganization
court
is
bound
to
recognize
his
secured
claim,
but
then
the
question
still
remains
about
post-judgment
interest.
do
you
have...
do
you
have
some
instruction--
justice
byron
r.
white
--wouldn't
say
that
if
they
were
claiming
interest
before
the
bankruptcy
petition
was
filed.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
even
if
it,
even
if
it
isn't
stated
in
the
agreement,
you're
going
to
get
interest
under
the
law
up
til
the
time
of
the
petition
in
bankruptcy.
it
may
be
the
general
rule
that
after
that
you
don't
get
interest,
but
you
do
before.
justice
byron
r.
white
wait
a
minute,
wait
a
minute.
up
til
the
time
of
the
petition.
you
mean,
you're
not
going
to
get
interest
in
bankruptcy
unless
it's
specified
in
the
agreement?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be,
that
may
be
so,
but
how...
in
an
ordinary
contract
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
a,
what
about
a
seller
of
goods
who
delivers
the
goods
and
the
payment
is
due,
and
it
is
not
paid,
and
there's
no
provision
in
the
contract
for
interest,
and
then
the
buyer
goes
into
bankruptcy,
and
interest...
if
you
had
gone
to
court,
the...
no
doubt
that
you
would
have
gotten
prejudgment
interest.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
doesn't?
isn't
it...
as
justice
scalia
asked
you,
isn't
it
normally
that
courts
give
you
interest
up
to
the
date
of
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
in
a
state,
in
a
state
where
the
law
is
by
judicial
decision
that
in
the
contract
case
i
gave
to
you--
justice
byron
r.
white
--interest
accrues
up
to
the
date
of
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
surely
in
a
bankruptcy
case,
wouldn't
you...
if
there
hasn't
been
any
judgment,
nevertheless,
here
comes
bankruptcy,
a
claim
is
filed,
wouldn't
the
claim
be
allowed
if
it
claimed
interest
up
to
the
date
of
bankruptcy?
justice
byron
r.
white
congress,
asked
congress?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
this
case
involve
post-petition
interest?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
government
entitled
to
interest
on
its
claim
up
until
that
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
is
entitled
to
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
oversecured,
the
oversecured
creditor
is
one
whose
security
is
greater
than
the
principal
plus
interest
up
to
the
date
of
the
petition.
justice
byron
r.
white
