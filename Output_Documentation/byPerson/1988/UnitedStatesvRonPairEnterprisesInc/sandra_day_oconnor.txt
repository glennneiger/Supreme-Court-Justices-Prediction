mr.
wallace,
you
do
concede
that
the
majority
rule
before
the
new
code
was
to
the
contrary,
that
interest
would
not
be
allowable?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
isn't...
is
it
a
little
odd
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
and
nothing
more
explicit
than
the
placement
of
commas
to
change
a
rule
like
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
suppose
most
of
the
government's
claims
would
fit
in
this
oversecured
category.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
certainly
if
taxes
are
due,
the
government
asserts
a
lien
on
everything
the
taxpayer
owns.
