mr.
i.
william
cohen
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
followed
the
decisions
of
this
court
when
it
concluded
that
section
506(b)
of
the
bankruptcy
code
does
not
overrule
pre-code
law,
and
that
the
language
of
the
statute
does
not
provide
for
the
payment
of
post-petition
interest
on
oversecured,
nonconsensual
liens.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
followed
three
recent
decisions
of
this
court
which
focused
on
the
proper
rule
of
statutory
construction
in
this
situation.
the
normal
rule
of
statutory
construction
is
that
if
congress
intends
for
legislation
to
change
the
interpretation
of
a
judicially
created
concept,
it
makes
that
intention
specific.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
we
believe,
your
honor,
that
section
506(b)
did
codify
pre-code
law.
it
codified
the
entitlement
of
secured
creditors
to
interest
if
they
were
consensual
secured
creditors.
it
didn't
abrogate--
mr.
i.
william
cohen
--well,
the
voluntary
lien,
justice,
was
a
lien
that
would
be
created
by
agreement,
and
the
reason
that
the
section
506(b)
adopts
the
pre-code
law
is
the
rationale
behind
that
was
to
allow
secured
creditors
only
if
they
negotiated
for,
only
if
they
bargained
for
interest
to
be
entitled
to
interest.
and--
mr.
i.
william
cohen
--yes,
i
am.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
the
five
court
of
appeals
cases,
all
the
courts
of
appeal
decisions
that
dealt
with
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
a
tax
lien
was
entitled
to
interest
stated
that
it
was
required
to
be
included
in
the
agreement.
all
the
courts
of
appeal
decisions
required
that.
the
bass
case,
the
kerber
case--
mr.
i.
william
cohen
--the
bass
case;
the
boston
and
maine
corporation
case,
which
was
a
first
circuit
case;
the
kerber
packing
company
case,
which
was
the
seventh
circuit
case;
the
harrington
case,
fourth
circuit;
and
the
mighell
case,
which
was
the
tenth
circuit.
all
cases
required
a
secured
creditor
to
have
a
provision
for
interest
in
his
agreement,
required
him
to
be
a
consensual
secured
creditor
in
order
to
be
entitled
to
interest.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
always,
in
all
of
those
cases,
the
government
is
making
a
claim
for
interest.
the
courts
of
appeals
decisions--
mr.
i.
william
cohen
--i'm
not
aware
of
any,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
that
the
reason
that
mr.
wallace
is
making
the
distinction
is
that
he
is
overlooking
the
rationale
for
the
decision,
the
rationale
for
the
requirement
that
a
creditor
must
be
a
consensual
creditor
in
order
to
be
entitled
to
interest.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
that
in
order
to
be
able
to
share
interest,
to
be
entitled
to
interest
before
other
creditors
get
paid,
you
have
to
have
bargained
for
interest.
the
courts
universally
recognized
that
if
a
party
did
not
bargain
for
interest,
he
ought
not
be
entitled
to
it
because
the
result
of
giving
a
creditor
interest
who
didn't
bargain
for
it
is
to
deprive
all
of
the
creditors
below
that
creditor
of
their
right
to
share
in
the
distribution.
in
most
insolvency
states,
estates,
there's
barely
enough
to
pay
the
principal
of
claims
let
alone
interest,
and
if
the
assets
of
the
estate
are
consumed
by
the
payment
of
interest,
it's
likely
that
there
will
be
no
distribution
to
the
creditors
below.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
the
general
rule
is
that
interest
stops
on
the
date
of
bankruptcy,
your
honor.
interest
stops
for
secured
creditors
and
unsecured
creditors,
and
that's
been
the
law
of
this
court.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
yes.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
it
is
not.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
no,
because
the--
mr.
i.
william
cohen
--you
would
only
be
entitled
to
interest,
your
honor,
if
the
agreement
provided
for
it,
or
if
a
particular
statute--
mr.
i.
william
cohen
--only
if
the
agreement
provides
for
it
or
if
a
statute
gives
you
interest.
there
are
many
creditors,
your
honor,
who
do
not
get
interest
even
up
to
the
date
of
bankruptcy.
but--
mr.
i.
william
cohen
--if
the
statute
that
created
the
contract,
or
the
contract
between
the
parties
entitled
that
creditor
to
interest,
he
would
be
entitled
to
interest
up
to
the
date
of
bankruptcy.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
if
the
law
of
the
jurisdiction,
your
honor,
gave
you
interest--
mr.
i.
william
cohen
--yes,
but
it's
different
here,
and
the
reason
that
it's
different
is
because
this
court
has
seen
fit
to
say
on
many
occasions
that
interest
stops
on
the
date
of
bankruptcy.
in
the
new
york
v.
saper
case
this
court--
mr.
i.
william
cohen
--yes.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
okay.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
yes,
up
to
the
date
of
bankruptcy.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
it's
a...
it
was
originally
a
judicial
decision,
your
honor.
originally
in
the--
mr.
i.
william
cohen
--it
did.
it
codified
that
prohibition
against
the
accrual
of
interest,
and
really,
the
situation
that
we
have
today
is
precisely
the
same.
the
case
law
developed
exceptions
to
the
general
rule.
the
general
rule,
as
you
have
suggested,
chief
justice,
is
in
section
502.
that
section
says
that
interest
does
not
accrue
after
the
date
of
bankruptcy.
the
exceptions
to
that
rule
were
discussed
in
the
case
law,
and
there
were
three
exceptions
that
were
developed
as
a
result
of
the
cases
that
discussed
the
issue.
the
first
exception
said
that
interest
was
allowed
in
those
estates
where
the
debtor
was
solvent;
where
there
was
enough
to
pay
all
creditors
both
principal
and
interest,
interest
was
allowed
to
be
paid.
the
second
exception
arose
in
the
situation
where
the
secured
creditor
was
in
possession
of
the
collateral,
and
the
collateral
earned
income
after
the
date
of
bankruptcy.
in
that
situation
the
secured
creditor
is
entitled
to
interest.
the
only
exception
that
the
government
says
applies
today
is
the
third
exception,
and
that's
the
exception
that
evolved
that
allowed
interest
in
situations
where
the
collateral
exceeded
the
debt.
but
all
of
the
courts
of
appeal
that
decided
the
issue
before
the
adoption
of
the
bankruptcy
code
stated
unequivocally
that
interest
is
not
to
be
paid
to
an
oversecured
tax
claimant.
and
those
are
the
decisions
that
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
and
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
for
that.
first
of
all,
as
an
aside,
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
the
internal
revenue
never
asked
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
code
and
at
the
time
of
all
of
the
revisions
to
the
code
after
that
in
1978,
never
asked
that
interest
be
paid
on
the
oversecured
claims
due
internal
revenue.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
they
have
never
asked
for
that.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
that's
correct.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
cited,
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
cited
the
nicholas
case.
the
nicholas
case
stands
for
the
general
proposition
that
interest
stops,
and
it
cited
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
interest
stops
on
the
date
of
bankruptcy.
that
case
specifically
referred
to
new
york
saper,
and
the
new
york
v.
saper
case
was
a
case
that
extended
that
general
rule
to
tax
claims.
that
case
was
cited
by
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue.
the
table
of
derivation
of
house
rule
8200
stated
that
the
present
law,
in
reference
to
section
506(b),
was
in
re
black
ranches.
well,
in
re
black
ranches
was
an
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
decision
which
said
that
interest
is
payable
to
an
oversecured
consensual
creditor,
not
to
a
nonconsensual
creditor.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
yes.
a--
mr.
i.
william
cohen
--a
consensual
creditor
is
a
creditor
whose
secured
claim
arises
by
agreement.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
i
am
not
aware
of
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
yes.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
yes.
they
are
cited
in
the
amicus
brief
and,
i
believe
the
black
ranches
case
is
cited
in
our
case.
the
nicholas
case
is
cited
in
the
amicus
brief.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
i
would
have
to
check,
your
honor.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
yes.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
it's
only
entitled
to
interest
up
to
the
date
of
bankruptcy.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
yes,
it
is,
and
it's
entitled
to
interest
after
the
date
of
confirmation.
and
the
reason
that
the
law
has
denied--
mr.
i.
william
cohen
--yes.
the
reason
that
the
law
has
denied
the
government's
right
to
interest
after
the
date
of
bankruptcy
is
based
on
the
equitable
rule
that
where
the
exaction
and
collection
of
interest
is
not
fair
to
other
creditors
because
of
the
initiation
of
the
insolvency
proceeding,
in
other
words,
the
power
to
pay,
the
power
to
pay
the
claim
is
stopped
as
a
result
of
the
bankruptcy
proceeding,
it
unfairly
penalizes
other
creditors
because
there
is
rarely
enough
to
pay
the
principal
amount
of
the
claim,
let
alone
interest.
and
as
i
said
earlier,
the
city
of
new
york
v.
saper
stood
for
the
proposition
that
this
general
rule
which
applied
to
all
claims,
secured
and
unsecured
claims,
also
applied
to
tax
claims.
the
three
exceptions
to
the
general
rule
we've
discussed
earlier,
and
the
five
courts
of
appeals
decisions
were
also
discussed.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
itself
or
in
the
legislative
history
that
reflects
an
intention
on
the
part
of
congress
to
change
the
existing
law.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
well--
mr.
i.
william
cohen
--except
that
this
court,
your
honor,
has
held
on
several
occasions
that
punctuation
should
not
be
a
part
of
the
law,
that
if
the
punctuation
is
confusing,
if
the
punctuation--
mr.
i.
william
cohen
--if
you
look
at
section
506(b),
you
see
that
the
last
clause
in
that
section,
provided
for
under
the
agreement
under
which
such
claim
arose,
qualifies
the
word
"interest"
just
as
it
qualifies
the
terms
"reasonable
fees,
costs
or
charges.
"
mr.
i.
william
cohen
well,
i
realize,
your
honor,
that
we
all
read
the
statute
differently,
and
i
also
realize
that
there's
no
way
that
the
ambiguity
in
the
statute
for
one
person
is
necessarily
going
to
exist
for
another
person.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
i
appreciate
that,
and
the
cases
have
talked
about
that.
but
there
were
two
courts
of
appeal
decisions
after
the
code
that
said
that
that
language
is
ambiguous.
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
first
circuit
found
the
language
ambiguous.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
and
that's
precisely
why
we're
here
today.
the
courts
have
split
on
this
issue.
it's
the
opinion
of
many,
including
legal
scholars
who
have
discussed
this
section,
that
the
language
is
ambiguous,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
you
apply
the
rules
of
construction
that
the
government
asks
the
court
to
adopt
today,
you
find
that
the
cases
that
have
discussed
those
rules
of
construction
have
used
language
that
we
have
in
this
case
and
found
exactly
the
opposite,--
in
the
moore
case,
justice
brandeis
found
that
language,
exactly
the
same
as
we
have
in
this
case
today,
should
be
interpreted
in
an
opposite
way.
he
said
that
when
you
apply
a
clause
to
words
that
would
make
as
much
sense
if
you
applied
it
to
all
the
words
as
it
would
if
you
applied
it
to
just
a
few
words,
it
should
be
applied
to
all
of
the
words.
and
in
this
case,
if
you
applied
that
principle
discussed
in
the
moore
case
by
justice
brandeis,
you
would
find
that
the
term
"provided
for
in
the
agreement"
applies
to
interest
as
well
as
fees.
and
that's
the
position
that
the
courts
of
appeals
have
said,
and
that's
the
position
that
we
believe
is
the
appropriate
decision
for
this
court
to
make.
the--
mr.
i.
william
cohen
--506(d),
your
honor?
mr.
i.
william
cohen
yes.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
yes.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
i
believe
it
does,
yes.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
no.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
506(b)
has
to
be
interpreted
in
light
of
the
pre-code
decisions.
the
pre-code
decisions
can
be
read
consistently
with
this
section,
and
that
is
that
interest
is
not
allowed
under
the
pre-bankruptcy
code
decisions--
mr.
i.
william
cohen
--well,
only
section
(c)
applies
to...
i'm
sorry.
(b)
applies
to
oversecured
consensual
liens,
and
if
a
lien
is
oversecured,
your
honor,
then
it
falls
within
subsection
(b).
subsection--
mr.
i.
william
cohen
--i'm
sorry,
exclusively
to--
mr.
i.
william
cohen
--i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
i
believe
so.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
well,
it
would
be,
your
honor
if
you
were
not
reading
(b)
in
light
of
the
pre-code
decisions.
so
what
i
am
asking
the
court
to--
mr.
i.
william
cohen
--it's
plausible,
but
it
disregards
the
prior
law,
it
disregards
the
fact
that
there
is
no
legislative
history
to
explain
why
the
law
would
be
changed,
and
it
disregards
the
rationale
for
the
law
which
we
believe
was
carried
over
into
the
bankruptcy
code.
we
believe
that
this
section
should
be
read
to
carry
over
the
prior
law
that
existed
before
1978.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
it
can,
justice
scalia,
but
when
that
change
is
going
to
be
made,
there's
usually
a
reference
in
the
legislative
history
to
explain
the
reason
that
the
change
is
going
to
be
made.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
but
that's
precisely
the
point
i--
mr.
i.
william
cohen
--that's
precisely
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
a
moment
ago.
the
internal
revenue
service
never
requested
congress
to
make
a
change.
they
specifically
cited
a
case
that
stood
for
the
proposition
that
we
believe
stands
for
the
law
that
we're
asking
you
to
confirm
today,
and
the
justice
department
never
asked
congress
to
make
a
change
on
this
issue.
the
reason
that
they
never
asked
is
because
they
recognized
that
the
law
was
continued
and
would
continue
as
it
had
been
pre-code.
they
had
asked
the
courts
five
times
to
change
the
law
so
that
they
would
be
entitled
to
interest,
and
in
all
five
times
they
were
rebuffed.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
there
are
legal
scholars
who
have
discussed
that
issue,
and
probably
the
leading
treatise
on
bankruptcy
law
is
collier's
on
bankruptcy,
and
he
specifically
discussed
this
point.
collier
suggests
that
the
reason
for
the
comma
is
to
interpret
this
section
in
a
way
that
would
eliminate
the
right
or
prevent
interest
being
charged
on
anything
but
principal.
there
are
some
contracts
that
provide
that
interest
can
be
charged
on
top
of
the
costs,
the
fees,
and
the
charges,
and
it
is
collier's
interpretation
that
it
was
precisely
the
intention
of
the
crafters
in
inserting
the
comma
here
to
make
sure
that
interest
would
only
be
included
or
charged
on
the
claim
and
not
on
the
other
items.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
correct.
now,
the
government
suggests
that
the
doctrine
of
the
last
antecedent
is
an
answer
to
the
issue
if
the
court
is
not
satisfied
with
the
grammar,
with
the
construction,
or
with
the
placement
of
the
words
in
the
sentence,
but
the
doctrine
of
the
last
antecedent,
as
we
have
suggested,
is
nothing
but
an
aid
to
construction,
and
the
moore
case
specifically
discussed
that
same
doctrine
and
came
to
an
opposite
conclusion.
we're
asking
you
really
not
to
rely
on
the
comma
in
interpreting
the
law,
but
rather,
to
look
to
the
law
as
this
court
has
interpreted
it
in
other
decisions
and
as
five
courts
of
appeal
decisions
before
the
adoption
of
the
bankruptcy
code
interpreted
it,
and
as
two
courts
of
appeal
decisions
since
the
code
was
adopted
have
interpreted
that
decision.
if
there
was
no
pre-existing
law,
i
think
that
the
government's
argument
would
be
more
persuasive
about
the
rules
of
statutory
construction,
but
the
decisions
of
this
court
which
the
government
overlooks
in
discussing
this
issue
are
diametrically
opposed
to
what
they're
saying.
the
government
is
saying
that
there
is
no
precedential
value
in
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
and
yet
you
recently
said
in
united
savings
v.
timbers
of
inwood
that
section
506(b)
codifies
pre-code
law.
you
said
in
midlantic
v....
in
midlantic
national
bank
and
kelly
v.
robinson
that
it's
presumed
that
congress
is
aware
of
judicial
precedent
and
that
it's
a
normal
rule
of
statutory
construction
that
if
congress
intends
to
change
judicially
created
concepts
that
are
in
existence
at
the
time
a
statute
is
adopted,
it
makes
that
intent
specific.
what
the
government
does
in
this
case
is
they
twist
and
turn
in
an
attempt
to
get
out
from
under
those
three
decisions.
they
specifically
forget
that
all
three
cases,
the
midlantic
case,
timbers
of
inwood,
and
kelly
v.
robinson,
dealt
with
the
statutory
construction
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
and
timbers
dealt
with
the
meaning
of
section
506(b).
mr.
i.
william
cohen
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
you
may
be
mixing
up
two
concepts.
you
talked
about
an
involuntary
lien.
i
am
distinguishing
between
a
consensual
lien
and
a
nonconsensual
lien.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
yes.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
right.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
that's
correct.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
that's
correct,
because
the
general
rule
is
that
interest
stops
on
the
date
of
bankruptcy.
it's
only
the
three
narrow
exceptions
that
we
spoke
about
in
our
brief
and
that
the
amicus
brief
addresses,
only
in
those
three
narrow
exceptions
that
the
general
rule
changes.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
i
am
suggesting
that
the
language
of
506(b)
is
ambiguous,
and
that's
why
we--
mr.
i.
william
cohen
--interest
on
the
amount
of
the
claim
up
to
the
date
of
bankruptcy.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
it
has
to
be
supported
by
an
agreement
that
says
you
get
interest.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
it
would
be,
your
honor.
most
agreements
specifically
define
what's...
what
interest
is
calculated
on.
it's
collier's
that
made
the
distinction
that
that's
how
it
saw
the
comma,
that
the
comma,
was
really
intended
to
limit
the
accumulation
of
interest
only
on
that
portion
of
the
claim
that
was
the
claim
itself,
and
not
costs
and
fees.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
he
says
that
the
precedent
suggests
that
it
has
to
be
provided
in
the
agreement.
he
believes
that
the
precedent,
the
pre-code
precedent
is
the
proper
interpretation
of
this
section.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
no,
he's
not,
your
honor.
mr.
i.
william
cohen
several
people
who
are
contributing
authors
to
collier's.
in
the
kelly
v.
robinson
case,
this
court
told
us
that
of
course
the
starting
point
in
every
case
involving
construction
of
a
statute
is
the
language
itself.
in
citing
justice
o'connor,
the
court
said
in
expounding
a
statute,
we
must
not
be
guided
by
a
single
sentence
or
a
member
of
a
sentence,
but
look
to
the
provisions
of
the
whole
law
and
to
its
objects
and
policy.
it's
our
belief
that
the
objects
and
policy
of
this
law
mandate
that
the
court
looks
to
the
general
rule
that
would
deny
the
payment
of
interest
as
of
the
date
of
bankruptcy,
and
only
in
the
three
narrow
exceptions
which
the
courts
have
dealt
with
should
the
government
be
seen
as
a
party
that
potentially
would
be
entitled
to
interest.
in
the
face
of
the
confusing
comma
and
the
patent
ambiguity
of
section
506(b),
as
well
as
the
absence
which
the
government
admits
of
any
indication
whatsoever
that
congress
intended,
considered
or
even
contemplated
changing
the
case
law
which
had
preceded
506(b),
we
respectfully
urge
you
to
look
at
the
pre-code
cases
and
to
continue
to
make
the
decisions
based
upon
the
reasons
that
were
enunciated
in
those
decisions.
at
the
very
least,
the
government's--
mr.
i.
william
cohen
--thank
you.
