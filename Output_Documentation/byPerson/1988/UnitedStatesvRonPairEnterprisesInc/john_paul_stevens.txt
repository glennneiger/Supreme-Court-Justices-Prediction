paul

mr.
wallace,
can
i
interrupt
for
just
a
second?
it
is
true
that
the
words
"such
claim"...
you
are
saying
there
are
two
kinds
of
such
claims,
and
you
use
the
same
words,
"such
claim",
to
describe
both
of
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
words
"such
claim"
are
used
repeatedly
in
the
sentence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
there
is
a
difference
in
mechanics'
liens
because
they
do
just
attach
to
a
limited
number
of
assets,
i
presume.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
isn't
it
true
that
customarily
in
a
mechanic's
lien
foreclosure
that
under
most
state
statutes,
doesn't
the
lienor
get
attorneys'
fees
and
costs?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
so,
i
wonder
why
there
is
a
distinction
in
this
statute
between
interest
on
the
one
hand
and
fees.
does
it
make
any
difference
to
anybody
except
in
a
tax
case?
i
don't...
it's
kind
of
a
strange--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand,
but
i
was
thinking
in
a
mechanic's
lien
case
there
probably
is
no
agreement
for
fees,
but
the
practice,
apart
from
bankruptcy,
might
well
be
to
recover
fees,
and
i
just
wonder
why
they
should
get
interest
but
no
fees.
sort
of
a
strange
distinction
in
the
statute,
because
i
gather
they
would
get...
under
your
view
they
would
get
interest
but
not
fees
or
other
reasonable
costs.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wallace,
can
i
interrupt
you
with
another
question,
because
i've
been
puzzling
with
this
language
as
i've
been
listening
to
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
am
i
correct
in
understanding
your
argument
to
advise
us
that
in
the
pre-code
law,
the
liens
that
were
consensual
and
evidenced
by
a
written
agreement
really
could
have
been
of
two
kinds...
one,
they
didn't
have
to
mention
interest
in
order
to
have
interest
be
allowable
on
such
claims,
but
they
did
have
to
mention
fees
or
costs
for
fees
or
costs
to
be
allowable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
that
distinction
that
you
identify
perhaps
provides
an
explanation
for
the
two
kinds
of
such
claims,
both
of
which
would
be
written
claims,
but
one
of
which
would
say
nothing,
and
therefore
you
could
get
interest
on
it,
and
the
second
of
which
might
refer
to
fees
and
costs,
and
therefore
require
the
language
at
the
end
to
fit.
and
that
might
explain
the
commas.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
would
fit
this
language
if
one
read
the
words
"such
claim"
to
refer
only
to
consensual
claims.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
language
at
the
very
end
refers
to
the
agreement,
the
agreement
under
which
such
claims
are
proposed--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--which
seems
to
think
that
there
is
an
agreement
in
all
of
the
claims
referred
to
in
the
sentence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
you,
because
you
seem
to
disagree
with
mr.
wallace
on
what
the
pre-code
law
was,
are
the
cases
that
you
just
called
our
attention
to
cases
in
which
the
government
was
making
a
claim
for
interest,
or
are
those
cases
in
which
a
private
secured
creditor
was
asking
for
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
have
any
cases
involving
private
creditors
who
were
claiming
interest,
and
they
said...
and
the
court
said
no,
you
can't
have
it
because
it's
not
in
your
agreement.
that's
what
mr.
wallace
says
their
cases
so
hold.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cohen,
let
me
just
be
sure...
you've
cited
us
the
nicholas
case
and
the
black
ranch
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
these
cited
in
your
brief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
not
in
yours.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
stein,
there's
a
little
bit
of
a
problem
with
the
language
under
your
reading
because
the
interest
on
such
claim,
it
seems
to
me,
is
not
necessarily
just
interest
on
the
principal,
but
it
also
could
be
interest
on
the
principal
plus
interest
that
accrued
to
the
date
of
the
petition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
allowable?
is
it
interest
on
the
principal
or
interest
on
the
amount
of
the
claim
at
the
time
it's
allowed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
has
to
be
supported
by
a
provision
in
the
agreement
that
says
you
get
interest
on
the
principal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
without
saying
what
it's
on?
that
would
be
an
unusual
agreement.
