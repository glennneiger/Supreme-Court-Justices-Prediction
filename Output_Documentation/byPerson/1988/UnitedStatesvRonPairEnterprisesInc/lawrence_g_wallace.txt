mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
a
narrow
question
of
statutory
construction
dealing
with
the
rights
of
secured
creditors
under
the
bankruptcy
code
in
the
collateral
securing
their
claims.
the
question
is
to
be
distinguished
from
any
question
of
priorities
under
the
code
because
the
code
treats
secured
claims
separately,
and
to
the
extent
the
collateral
is
consumed
meeting
the
rights
of
secured
creditors,
it
does
not
pass
into
the
general
assets
of
the
estate
available
for
distribution
to
other
creditors,
priority
or
general
creditors.
the
particular
question
concerns
post-petition
interest
allowed
to
holders
of
secured
claims
by
section
506(b)
of
the
code.
the
general
rule
under
the
code
is
that
all
claimants
who
would
have
a
basis
for
it
in
the
absence
of
bankruptcy
are
allowed
pre-petition
interest.
this
is
memorialized
by
negative
implication
in
section
502(b)(2),
and
the
general
rule
further
is
that
the
right
to
interest
is
then
cut
off
upon
the
filing
of
the
petition
in
bankruptcy,
except
as
the
code
otherwise
provides.
the
right
to
interest,
incidentally,
resumes
again
after
the
confirmation
of
the
plan
of
the
debtor
in
possession
or
of
the
trustee
by
the
bankruptcy
court.
this
is
provided
by
section
1129
of
the
code,
which
created
the
possibility
of
stretching
out
payments
under
the
plan,
and
in
return
for
that,
all
creditors
whose
payments
are
stretched
out
are
given
a
right
to
interest,
and
the
right
to
interest
for
federal
tax
creditors
under
the
tax
liens
is
in
1129(a)(9)(c).
so
what
we
are
really
talking
about
is
whether
there
is
a
right
to
interest
during
this
intervening
period,
the
post-petition,
pre-confirmation
period.
and
that's
what
we
mean
by
post-petition
interest.
now,
the
provision
at
issue
is
set
forth
on
page
2
of
the
government's
brief,
and
section
502(b)
is
one
of
the
provisions,
and
indeed,
the
most
important
provision
in
the
code
that
allows
post-petition
interest,
and
the
precise
question
here
which...
and
the
code
in
this
provision
deals
with
this
question
by
statute
for
the
first
time.
it
was
previously
just
a
matter
of
judge-made
rules.
the
question
is
whether
section
506(b)
applies
to
all
secured
claims
with
respect
to
the
right
to
post-petition
interest,
or
whether
it
carries
forward
a
distinction
that
had
been
recognized
by
some
courts
of
appeals
prior
to
the
code
between
consensual
and
nonconsensual
secured
claims,
with
only
the
consensual
ones
being
awarded
post-petition
interest.
the
consensual
ones
are
those
created
by
contract,
typically,
secured
claims
of
financial
institutions
or
other
business
institutions.
the
nonconsensual
claims,
in
addition
to
the
tax
lien
claims
such
as
are
involved
here,
would
include
mechanics'
liens
or
workmen's
liens
or
liens
arising
from
the
execution
of
a
judgment,
in
favor
of
a
judgment
creditor
such
as
a
tort
victim.
and
the
question
is
whether
this
category
of
claimants,
including
the
government
tax
liens,
benefit
from
the
same
rule
that
some
courts
previously
applied
only
to
claims
created
by
agreement.
in
the
particular
case
it
is
stipulated
that
the
collateral
securing
the
government's
tax
lien
which
has
been
perfected
is
amply
sufficient
to
cover
both
the
claim
and
any
interest
that
would
be
accrued
under
section
506(b).
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
typically
to
real
property
and
any
other
assets
to
which
a
security
interest
could
attach,
the
same
as
is
true
of
many
commercial
liens
today
that
are
created
by
agreement.
there
was
a
time
when
it
was
typical
for
the
commercial
lien
to
attach
to
only
one
particular
piece
of
property,
but
it
is
much
more
commonplace
in
commercial
practice
now
for
the
lien
to
be
as
oversecured
as
the
secured
creditor
can
make
it.
and
this
is
what
is
known
in
the
pariance
as
an
oversecured
claim
as
well
because
it
is
secured
by
more
than
the
value
of
the
claim
plus
any
interest
that
would
be
accrued.
the
starting
point
for
any
question
of
statutory
interpretation
is,
of
course
the
statutory
language,
and
if
we
look
at
section
506(b),
it
seems
apparent
from
the
language
that
two
categories
of
rights
to
payments
are
set
up
in
the
final
several
lines
of
the
provision.
there
shall
be
allowed
to
the
holder
of
such
claim
interest
on
such
claim,
set
off
by
commas
then
from
"and
any
reasonable
fees,
costs
or
charges.
"
provided
for
under
the
agreement
under
which
such
claim
arose.
facially,
that
seems
to
provide
for
two
different
categories,
a
more
comprehensive
right
to
interest
on
any
oversecured
claim,
and
a
qualified
right
to
fees,
costs
or
charges
provided
under
an
agreement,
if
the
claim
arises
from
an
agreement,
if
those
fees,
costs
or
charges
are
reasonable.
that
would
be
the
ordinary
way
to
read
the
language.
the
respondent,
in
order
to
adapt
the
language
of--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
believe
that
the
"such"
refers
back
to
the
fact
that
the
claim
has
to
be
an
oversecured
claim--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--to
put
it
in
the
shortest
verbiage.
the
beginning
part
of
subsection
(b)
explains
that
we're
talking
only
about
oversecured
claims
and
only
to
the
extent
that
the
oversecured
aspect
would
cover
the
interest
payments.
so
the
"such"
really
has
to
refer
back
to
that.
otherwise,
that
limitation
on
the
right
to
post-petition
interest
would
be
lost
in
the
subsequent
clauses.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
concede
that
indeed.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
a
little
odd
that
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history.
i
would
not
say
that
there's
nothing
more
explicit
than
the
changing
of
commas,
which
i
will
get
to
in
a
moment,
but
i
do,
i
do
agree
that
the
case
probably
never
would
have
reached
this
court
if
the
legislative
history
had
addressed
this
precise
question,
which
it
did
not.
if
anything
in
the
legislative
history
had
said
we
are
now
rejecting
the
rule
that
several
courts
of
appeals
had
adopted,
there
would
be
no
basis
on
which
any
court
would
have
ruled
against
the
holders
of
a
claim
like
ours,
a
nonconsensual,
oversecured
claim.
and
i
don't
think
the
case
would
be
here.
so
it
is--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
and
it
is
also
correct
with
respect
to
judgment
liens,
and
for
the
most
part,
workmen's
or
mechanics'
liens
would
be
similarly
oversecured.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
and
that
is--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--but
there
is
no
basis
to
distinguish
them
from
tax
liens
under
this
provision.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
are
nonconsensual
liens,
and
if
nonconsensual
liens
are
not
entitled
to
post-petition
interest,
mechanics'
liens
would
fall
along
with
ours
for
that
purpose.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
insofar
as
i
am
aware--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
i
read
the
last
provision
of
subsection
(b)
as
indicating
that
the
bankruptcy
court
is
to
see
whether
fees
provided
for
in
an
agreement
are
reasonable--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--because
otherwise
those
fees
should
not
be
paid
to
the
detriment
of
other
creditors.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
this
is
way
of
protecting
other
creditors
from
some
extravagant
term
written
into
agreements.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
don't
see...
i
don't
see
a
basis
for
them
to
get
fees.
there
may
be
assets
that
survive
the
estate
from
which
they
would
have
a
right
under
state
law.
i
don't
know
whether
that
would
be
discharged.
i'm
sure
you
could
instruct
me
about
mechanics'
liens
because
i
have
never
been
involved
in
that
kind
of
practice.
in
any
event,
in
order
to
fit
their
contentions
within
the
language
of
the
statute,
respondents
say
that
the
commas
should
be
erased,
and
then
section
506(b)
can
be
read
their
way.
there
are
several
difficulties
with
this
contention,
as
we
see
it.
in
the
first
place,
we
should
not
start
off
erasing
either
words
or
punctuation
as
the
approach
to
interpreting
what
congress
has
enacted.
punctuation
marks
are
put
into
statutes
to
clarify
their
meaning,
and
they
should
not
be
lightly
discarded
or
ignored.
in
the
second
place,
and
i
think
of
very
considerable
importance,
erasing
the
commas
at
issue
here
would
create
an
ambiguity
rather
than
resolve
an
ambiguity.
it
seems
to
us
that
while
the
statute
is
quite
clear
as
written,
there
would
be
an
ambiguity
without
the
commas
as
to
whether
the
doctrine
of
the
last
antecedent,
a
maxim
of
statutory
construction
that
we
discuss
on
pages
16
and
17
of
our
brief,
would
still
require
the
same
reading
that
we
say
is
plain
on
the
face
with
the
commas.
we
have
cited
several
cases
there
in
which
courts
have
held
that
the
modifying
language
under
the
doctrine
of
the
last
antecedent
applies
only
to
the
words
or
phrases
immediately
preceding
the
modifying
language.
the
very
first
case
that
we
cite
there,
quindlen
v.
prudential
insurance
company,
is
one
in
which
there
were
no
commas
between
the
provisions
of
the
statutory
language
at
issue.
it
was
a
section
of
the
louisiana
insurance
code
that
said
this
section
shall
not
apply
to
temporary
life
insurance
binders
nor
to
contracts
of
live
or
health
and
accident
insurance
which
do
not
contain
a
provision
for
cancellation
prior
to
the
date
to
which
premiums
have
been
paid.
and
the
question
is
whether
that
modifying
language
related
back
to
the
beginning
language
or
not.
there
was
no
comma
there.
so
the
suggestion
is
one
that
would
introduce
an
ambiguity.
the
third
problem
with
their
suggestion
is
that
it
would
be
an
awkward
way
to
draft
this
provision
to
accomplish
the
result
for
which
they
contend,
not
only
because
of
the
ambiguity
that
would
then
exist,
but
because
the
code
elsewhere,
when
it
wants
to
refer
only
to
consensual
secured
claims,
uses
a
term
of
art,
security
interest,
which
is
defined
in
the
definitions
section
of
the
code,
in
section
101(45),
as
"a
lien
created
by
agreement".
so
there
would
have
been
a
way
provided
for
in
the
definitions
section
of
the
code
itself
to
accomplish
that
result.
and
the
fourth
and
also
quite
important
fault
with
the
suggestion
that
we
need
only
erase
the
commas,
is
that
under
their
reading
of
the
language,
it
would
still
constitute
a
departure
from
the
prior
cases,
as
we
explain
in
our
reply
brief.
it
just
would
be
a
departure
from
the
prior
court
of
appeals
cases
that
they
would
favor
to
the
one
that
the
language
appears
to
suggest
because
they
would
prevail
in
this
case.
but
under
the
prior
cases,
the
distinction
was
based
entirely
on
the
method
under
which
the
security
was
obtained.
it
was
a
distinction
simply
between
consensual
and
nonconsensual
liens.
but
those
cases
did
not
hold
what
the
language
of
506(b)
obviously
would
require,
that
a
court
would
have
to
look
to
the
terms
of
the
agreement
in
the
consensual
lien
to
see
whether
the
agreement
provides
for
interest.
if
the
lien
was
consensual,
it
didn't
matter
whether
the
agreement
specified
interest
under
the
old
cases.
so
they
would
still
be
contending
for
a
departure
from
the
law
unless
the
words
the
congress
enacted
are
to
be
totally
ignored,
contrary
to
every
principle
of
approaching
statutory
construction.
now,
in
addition
to
the
language
of
the
statute,
the
context
rather
strongly
suggests
that
oversecured
claims
are
referred
to
comprehensively
in
section
506(b).
it
is
part
of
section
506,
which
is
the
general
provision
that
defines
the
determination
of
secured
status
for
all
categories
of
secured
claims,
and
as
we
explain
in
our
brief,
each
of
the
other
subsections
obviously
refers
comprehensively
to
all
categories
of
secured
claims.
so
there
is
no
reason
suggested
by
the
context
for
reading
section
506(b)
more
narrowly.
then
if
we
look
to
the
legislative
history,
it
simply
does
not
address
this
question,
which
seems
on
balance
to
be
to
our
advantage
to
us
because
this
could
not
qualify
as
one
of
the
rare
cases
in
which
literal
application
of
the
statute
will
produce
a
result
demonstrably
at
odds
with
the
intentions
of
the
drafters.
there's
nothing
to
show
that
the
drafters
did
not
intend
this.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
court
of
appeals
and
respondents
are
trying
to
give
more
weight
that
can
be
borne
by
the
mere
absence
of
an
explicit
indication
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
intended
to
change
the
role
that
had
been
adopted
by
some
courts
of
appeals
but
in
which
the
service,
incidentally,
had
never
acquiesced.
and
that's
why
the
question
had
continued
to
be
litigated
up
to
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
code.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
sure.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
really
don't
know
whether
they
had
to
mention
fees
or
costs,
but
i
don't
know
any
other
basis
on
which
fees
or
costs
could
have
been
allowed.
so
i
suppose
they
would
have
had
to.
but
interest
was
allowed
not
on
the
basis
of
a
term
in
the
agreement
specifying
it,
but
solely
on
the
basis
that
it
was
a
consensual
lien.
now--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--conceivably
that
distinction
could
have
been
written
into
the
law
that
way.
the
difficulty
is
that
the
language
used
by
congress
does
not
in
any
way
restrict
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--but
there's
no
antecedent
for
that,
if
i
may
say
so,
mr.
justice.
there's
nothing
for
the
"such"
to
refer
back
to
the
first
time
the
word
"such"
is
used
other
than
the
explanation
that
it
has
to
be
an
oversecured
claim.
there's
no
other
possible
antecedent.
there's
no--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--yes,
but
such
is
used--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--one
would
have
to
read
that
back
and
say
that
the
"such",
the
first
time
it's
used,
does
not
have
a
prior
antecedent,
but
that
the
whole
thing
should
be
read
sort
of
from
the
back
to
front.
it's
a
strained
reading
of
the
text
that
would
not
occur
in
the
absence
of
an
effort
to
preserve
prior
law
beyond
what
would
seem
to
be
justified
by
the
text.
we
have
discussed
the
legislative
history
in
some
detail
to
show
that
congress
was
well
aware
of
reasons
why
the
rationale
that
had
been
expressed
in
the
prior
cases
had
become
largely
outmoded
by
changes
in
commercial
practice
and
by
the
federal
tax
lien
act
of
1966
which
adopted
an
approach
to
notification
of
other
creditors
of
federal
tax
liens
and
clarification
of
filings
that
was
quite
comparable
to
the
protection
afforded
by
the
uniform
commercial
code
for
consensual
liens,
so
that
the
two
main
rationales
that
had
been
expressed
in
the
older
cases,
that
it
was
harder
for
creditors
to
find
out
about
tax
liens,
and
that
consensual
liens
typically
applied
only
to
one
piece
of
property,
had
both
become
largely
obsolete,
and
congress
was
aware
that
they
had
become
obsolete.
so
there
is
considerable
reason
why
congress
would
not
have
wanted
to
preserve
the
old
rule.
and
then
on
the
last
two
pages
of
our
reply
brief,
pages
13
and
14,
we
explain
an
anomaly
that
would
be
introduced
into
five...
section
506
itself
if
the
old
rule
were
read
into
506(b)
because
506(d)
gives
a
secured
claimholder
the
right
to
skip
the
bankruptcy
process
altogether
and
preserve
his
claim,
and
that
way
he
would
have
a
right
to
interest,
and
he
would
have
an
incentive
to
skip
the
bankruptcy
process
if
he
had
to
sacrifice
his
right
to
post-petition
interest
in
order
to
invoke
his
rights
under
506(b).
so
all
of
these
reasons
add
up
to
us
to
the
proposition
that
the
proper
course
for
the
courts
here
in
interpreting
this
provision
is
to
take
congress
at
its
word
and
give
effect
to
the
provision
as
congress
enacted
it.
that
is
what
the
fourth
circuit
quite
properly
concluded
in
the
best
repair
decision
that
is
in
conflict
with
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
in
this
case,
and
that
is
the
judgment
we
submit
this
court
should
reach.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
had
not
managed
to
win
that
point.
we've
collected
the
prior
decisions
on
page
25
of
our
brief.
you'll
note
that
they
were
not
uniform.
the
harrington
case,
as
we
explain
in
the
footnote
on
page
25,
really
deviated
quite
substantially
from
the
other
pre-code
decisions.
the
last
of
the
decisions,
the
first
circuit
decision
in
boston
and
maine
corporation,
was
decided
after
the
code
was
enacted,
but
it
still
dealt
with
pre-code
law.
and
it's
an
indication
that
the
government
was
continuing
to
contest
the
issue
in
additional
circuits.
so
the
law
had
not
been
entirely
settled,
but
the
service's
view
had
not
prevailed.
we
were
unable
to
find
any
cases
in
which
it
had.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
chapter
11,
a
reorganization
with
a
debtor
in
possession.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
later
on,
that's
right.
he
can
preserve
his
claim
for
the...
to
assert
against
the
reorganized--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--under
506(d)
he
can
preserve
his
claim,
i
mean,
but
the
timing
of
it--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--he
may
not
be
able
to
do
it
while
the
reorganization
is
in
progress.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
have
some
information
that
a
creditor
could
be
forced
in
by
the
debtor
himself
filing
the
claim
on
his
behalf,
as
these
things
work.
that
is,
you
know,
a
point
that
we
make
at
the
end
of
our
reply
brief.
which
is
something
of
a
make
way
point.
i
think
our
case
stands
quite
strongly
without
it,
and
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
if
i
may.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
very
first
of
the
pre-code
cases
we
cite
on
page
25,
in
re
kerber,
is
one
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
exception
has
been
recognized
by
the
courts
to
the
extent
of
allowing
post-bankruptcy
interest
to
creditors
who
are
deemed
to
have
bargained
for
collateral
to
secure
not
only
the
principal
obligation
but
the
interest
thereon
as
well.
as
the
questioning
has
suggested,
the
law
ordinarily
deems
that
when
a
payment
is
due
on
a
certain
date
and
it
isn't
made
on
that
date,
that
interest
is
then
implied
to
the
creditor.
now,
this
court's
decisions
in
midlantic
and
kelly
quite
properly
were
cautious
about
affecting
areas
other
than
bankruptcy,
important
areas
such
as
abandonment
of
property
to
the
detriment
of
health
and
safety
or
obligations
to
make
restitution
to
victims
of
crime,
which
congress
could
not
have,
may
not
have
anticipated.
but
here
we
are
dealing
with
a
core
bankruptcy
matter,
and
to
refuse
to
give
effect
to
what
congress
enacted
because
of
an
absence
of
legislative
history
is
not
easy
to
reconcile
with
article
i
of
the
constitution
which
goes
not
require
legislative
history
in
order
for
congress
to
make
a
change
in
the
law.
a
majority
vote
in
each
house
and
the
signature
of
the
president
is
enough
to
supersede
prior
judge-made
law.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
cannot,
mr.
justice.
we
locked
at--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--at
cases
which
denied
post-petition
interest
to
nonconsensual
claims
and
said
that
they
were
available
for
consensual
claims.
we
were
not
examining
cases
that
might
have
distinguished
between
consensual
claims.
the
pre-code
law
did
not
have
the
kind
of
flat
rule
that
congress
has
provided.
the
courts
were
always
saying,
well,
the
bankruptcy
referee
can
do
what's
equitable
in
the
particular
case.
so
all
of
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--rules
were
malleable.
