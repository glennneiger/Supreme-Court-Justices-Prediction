justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
wallace,
you
say
that
the
government
hadn't
acquiesced
in
the
prior
decisions
that
had
not
allowed
interest
on
involuntary
liens.
were
there
any
decisions
that
agreed
with
the
government?
or
was
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
not
how
it
reads.
what
do
you
do
with
mr.
wallace's
point
that
there
is
no
way
to
read
this
to
codify
pre-code
law
if
you
consider
these
cases
standard
pre-code
law?
this
language,
no
matter
how
you
read
it,
requires
that
interest
be
provided
for
in
the
text
of
the
agreement,
and
the
pre-code
law
didn't
divide
between
whether
it
was
provided
for
in
the
text
or
whether
it
was
not,
but
rather,
it
divided
between
voluntary
and
involuntary
liens,
whether
interest
was
explicitly
provided
for
in
the
voluntary
lien
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
saying
the
pre-code
law
did
require
that
the
agreement
contain
a
provision
for
interest?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
of
those
cases
say
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
certainly
have
a
basis
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
rationale?
i
don't
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
gee,
but
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
in
accord
with
what
the
law
usually
does.
if
i
make
a
contract
with
you
and
under
that
contract
money
is
due
on
a
certain
date,
and
i
don't
provide
in
the
contract
that
if
you
don't
pay
it
on
that
date
you'll
have
to
pay
me
interest,
the
law
would
still
give
me
interest,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
you're
telling
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i'm
saying
that
seems
to
me
contrary,
the
fact
that
it
has
to
be
spelled
out
in
the
agreement
and
that
it's
not
enough
that
the
agreement
is
simply
consensual,
so
that
it
would
be
an
implied
term.
wouldn't
it
be
an
implied
term
of
any
agreement
because
the
law
always
gives
interest?
justice
antonin
scalia
consensual
creditor
or
creditor
where
it's
provided
for
in
the
agreement.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
have
no
doubt
it
arises
out
of
the
agreement.
is
it
provided
for
in
the
agreement?
this
case
that
you're
quoting,
did
this
case
say
that
the
provision
for
interest
has
to
be
in
the
agreement,
which
is
how
the
statute
reads?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
need
legislative
history
to
show
that
a
change
is
made?
congress
can
surely
make
a
change
in
a
statute
without
even
having
a
committee
meeting,
can't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
sometimes,
not
always.
maybe
the
explanation
is
simply
that
the
justice
department
didn't
like
the
prior
rule,
they
hadn't
acquiesced
in
the
cases,
and
they,
they
got
to
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they
got
to
the
right
senators
or
members
of
the
house
and
got
it
changed.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
cohen,
can
i
get
back
to
the
text
and
ask...
my
problem
with
the
text
is
not
just
the
comma,
although
i
do
tend
to
read
commas
since
they
are
written
there.
it's
also,
it's
also
the
text
itself.
what
is
the...
it
seems
to
me
there's
no
utility
in
repeating
the
phrase
"such
claim"
unless
you
mean
to
separate
the
meanings
the
way
the
government
has
contended.
that
is
to
say,
if
the
passage
meant
what
you
say,
why
wouldn't
it
have
read,
leaving
out
the
comma,
there
shall
be
allowed
to
the
holder
of
such
claim
interest
and
any
reasonable
fees,
costs
or
charges
provided
for
under
the
agreement?
but
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
interest
on
such
claim
and
any
reasonable
fees,
costs
or
charges
provided
for
under
the
agreement
under
which
such
claim
arose.
i
don't
see
any
reason
for
the
first
"on
such
claim".
you
know,
what
else
would
it
be
interest
on?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's,
that's
a
good
explanation.
not
just...
that's
not
just
the
reason
for
the
comma;
it's
the
reason
for
saying
"on
such
claim".
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
cohen,
just
so
i
know
what
you're
urging
upon
us
as
the
principle
we
should
adopt,
you
want,
you
want
us
to
adopt,
and
you
say
this
is
what
the
pre-code
law
was,
the
principle
that
if
you
have
a
voluntary
lien,
you
can
get
interest,
post-petition
interest
if,
but
only
if
your
agreement
specifically
says
i
am
entitled
to
interest,
and
if
it
doesn't
specifically
say
that,
although
in
a
normal
lawsuit,
outside
of
bankruptcy,
you'd
be
allowed
interest,
you
can't
get
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
i
said
a
voluntary
lien,
i
believe,
and
if
you
want
to
say
consensual,
that's
fine.
it's
a
consensual
lien,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
pursuant
to
an
agreement
in
which
you
lend
me...
i
lend
you
money
or
whatever.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
would
allow...
you
want
us
to
interpret
this
language
so
that
post-petition
interest
would
be
allowed
only
if
the
agreement
by
which
i
lend
you
the
money
specifically
says
i'm
entitled
to
interest
if
you
don't
pay
me
the
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it
doesn't
specifically
say
that,
then
there
would
be
no
post-petition
interest.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
collier
say
that
the
agreement
itself
must
provide
for
interest,
or
does
he
make
simply
the
distinction
between
consensual
and
nonconsensual
liens?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wallace,
am
i
correct
that
you
no
more
can
point
for
us
to
a
pre-code
case
which
denied
interest
on
a
consensual
secured
claim
because
interest
was
not
specified
in
the
agreement
than
can
the
other
side
point
to
a
case
which
granted
it?
