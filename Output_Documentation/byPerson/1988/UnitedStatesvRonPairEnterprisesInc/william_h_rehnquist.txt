rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
87-1043,
united
states
v.
ron
pair
enterprises.
mr.
wallace,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wallace,
to
what
kinds
of
property
does
the
government's
tax
lien
extend?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
cohen.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
true,
mr.
cohen,
in
a
case
where
you
have
the
bankruptcy
code
of
1978
that
really
was
out
to
change
a
whole
lot
of
things?
i
mean,
that
isn't
simply
like
a
single
law
changing
an
earlier
decision.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thanks.
well,
isn't
the
reason
for
cutting
off
interest
with
bankruptcy
a
statutory
provision
rather
than
judicial
decision?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn't
it
now...
didn't
the
'78
code
provide
by
statute--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
about
the
placement
of
the
commas?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
that
gives
at
least
a
presumption,
doesn't
it,
that--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
what's
confusing
about
this
punctuation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that
certainly
isn't
at
all
apparent
to
me
just
by
reason
of
the
placement
of
the
commas.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
our
decisions
are
not
based
on
subjective
understandings.
there
is
supposed
to
be
some
general
rule
as
to
how
one
reads
an
english
sentence.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we
now
have
it
before
us
and
can
determine
for
ourselves
whether
it's
ambiguous
or
not.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
person
who
writes
collier's
still
named
collier?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cohen,
your
time
has
expired.
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wallace,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
