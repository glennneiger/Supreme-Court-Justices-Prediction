mr.
womack,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
district
court
admitted
the
evidence?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
resume
there
at
one
o'clock.
you
may
continue,
mr.
womack.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no
discovery
of
the
circumstances
under
which
the
investigation
was
conducted?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
i
read
the
text
of
the
rule
at
any
rate,
mr.
womack,
it
says,
section
(8)
says,
certain
stuff
shows
the
"factual
findings
resulting
from
an
investigation
made
pursuant
to
authority
granted
by
law,
unless
the
sources
of
information
or
other
circumstances
indicate
lack
of
trustworthiness.
"
that
would
sound
almost
like
the
burden
is
on
the
person
who
wants
to
show
that
they're
not
trustworthy.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
mr.
womack,
what
do
you
think
the
converse
of
factual
finding,
what
do
you
think
the
rulemakers
meant
to
exclude
when
they
said
factual
findings
shall
be
admissible?
do
you
think
it
was
legal
conclusions?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean
"fixation"?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
surely
the
law
of
evidence
has
been
kind
of
confused
for
many
years
by
efforts
to
distinguish
between
fact
and
opinion?
we
don't
want
to
get
into
that
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now
the
second
question
in
your
petition,
as
you
doubtless
know,
mr.
womack--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
are
you
bound
by
something
that
the
the
court
of
appeals--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
you're
not
bound
by
their
decision.
you're
petitioning
for
certiorari
and
asking
us
to
reverse
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--very
well,
mr.
womack.
mr.
larry,
now
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
aren't
we
then
just
embroiled
in
the
traditional
distinction
of
50
or
60
years
ago,
the
difference
between
fact
and
opinion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
surely
anyone
trained
as
a
lawyer
would
be
able
to
see
things
at
either
end
of
that
spectrum.
but
the
difficulties
come
in
the
middle,
where
very
competent
trial
judges,
very
competent
lawyers
may
see
things
differently.
and
do
we
want
reversals
of
trials
because
the
trial
judge
saw
it
one
way,
rather
than
the
other,
in
the
middle
of
the
spectrum?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
in
the
briefs
is
the
advisory
committee
language
that
you're
referring
to?
if
you
don't
know,
don't
bother.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
would
help.
what
i
would
like
to
do
is
get
it
in
front
of
me.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
your
view,
mr.
larry,
does
the
admissibility
of
opinion
in
this
sort
of
a
report
turn
on
whether
it's
trustworthy
or
not,
or
even
if
it's
very
trustworthy,--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
you
seek
to
offer
into
evidence
a
weather
forecast?
they
predict
for
the
next
24
hours
high
winds
and
heavy
rain.
is
that
admissible
under
this
section?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
that
that
doesn't
depend
on
opinion
at
all,
because
it's
that
kind
of
opinion
is
not
governed
by
this?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
isn't
that
opinion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
if
they
agree
on
it,
it's
not
opinion?
is
that
your
point?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
could
have
deposed
this
fellow,
you
could
have
called
him
as
an
adverse
witness.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can't
really
complain
that
your
right
of
cross-examination
was
cut
off.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
reading
verbatim
from
the
letter
or
the
document?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
a
separate
document?
when
you
say
the
document
are
you
referring
to
the
letter?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
surely
there
are
countless
rules
of
evidence.
by
number,
you
can't
think
that
a
statement
like
that
is
like
saying
this
should
come
in
under
rule
106.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
were
you
referring
to
as
the
prevailing
authority?
a
case
from
this
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
larry.
your
time
has
expired.
mr.
womack,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
womack.
the
case
is
submitted.
