justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
concede
that
part
of
the
memorandum
is
admissable
under
803(6)?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
all
parties
concede
that
803(6)
is
applicable
to
at
least
part
of
the
document?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
is
that
the
section
you're
relying
on?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
(8)?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
there
any
contention
it
was
admissible
under
(6)?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
it
your
position
that
rainey
could
not
get
this
document
in,
or
that
he
just
failed
to
do
so
in
a
proper
way?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words,
you
put
it
on
whether
or
not
he's
an
expert.
and
your
position,
i
take
it,
is
simply
because
you
asked
him
whether
he
made
a
statement,
and
read
from
a
document,
that
you're
not
introducing
the
document?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
isn't
that
what
happened?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
cross,
they
asked
him
about
the
document.
i
thought
your
position
would
be
that
since
the
document
wasn't
admitted,
and
there
was
no
way
that
he
either
could
or
did
ask
for
the
document
to
be
admitted
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
is
it
your
opinion
that
if
he
had
asked
for
the
admission
of
the
letter
at
that
time,
when
you
first
brought
the
letter
in,
that
the
trial
judge
would
have
had
to
admit
the
letter?
i
want
to
know
the
answer
to
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you're
telling
us
that
the
ruling
would
have
been
that
it
should
be
admitted?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
had
they?
they
had
asked
him
questions
about
the
letter.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
want
us
to
say
that
when
a
counsel
reads
from
a
document
and
asks
the
witness
if
he
made
the
statement,
that
that's
introducing
the
document?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
didn't
ask
for
it
to
be
introduced,
either?
