mr.
womack,
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
i'm
just
a
little
unclear
on
part
of
the
record.
i
don't
recall
it
that
well.
one
of
the...
the
judge
did
let
in
part
of
the
report?
he
let
in
the
section
that
says
the
most
probable
cause
of
the
accident
is
the
pilot's
failure
to
maintain
proper
interval.
that
did
go
in,
didn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
did
not
let
in
the
number
(6),
although
the
above
sequence
of
events
is
the
most
likely
to
have
occurred,
this
does
not
change
the
possibility
that
rollback
did
occur.
justice
john
paul
stevens
am
i
right
in
that?
why
did
he
let...
how
did
that
happen,
that
only
the
stuff
favorable
to
one
side
got
in?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you,
would
you
think
he
was
correct
in
that?
i
mean,
that's
that's...
why
is
one...
the
possibility
that
a
rollback
occurred,
which
is
consistent
with
the
plaintiff's
theory--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--can't
get
in,
but
a
probability
can?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
would
have
though
that
would
be
the
right
answer
myself;
that
you
either
put
it
in,
or
you
don't
put
it
in.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
the
plaintiff
object
to
that
editing
of
the
report?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand.
he
objected,
of
course,
to
number
(6)
going
in
or
to
number
(7),
going
in.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
didn't
take
a
position
if
(7)
goes
in,
then
the
rest
ought
to
go
in,
too?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
puzzling.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
you
a
question,
mr.
larry?
do
you...
am
i
correct
in
understanding
you
place
a
great
deal
of
emphasis
on
how
the
author
of
the
report
characterizes
the
material
in
the
report.
the
fact
that
he
calls
something
a
possibility
and
another
thing
a
probability
makes
a
big
difference.
the
fact
that
he
calls
something
a
finding
of
fact,
and
something
else
an
opinion...
am
i
correct
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
see
because--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
one
of
the
things
that
puzzles
me
is
that
the
judge
left
out
all
the
parts
of
the
possible
scenario,
in
paragraph
(5)(a)(b)(c)(d)
and
(e).
and
of
course,
if
it's
just
a
possibility,
maybe
it's
opinion,
it
shouldn't
go
in.
but
some
of
the
effects
that
are
described
in
that
possible
scenario
are
really
quite
factual.
i
mean,
some...
that
the
airplane
entered
the
pattern,
with
a
certain
person
at
the
controls,
and
i
guess,
you
know...
some
of
the
things
you
would
really
consider
to
be
factual,
even
though
the
whole
picture
is
a
possible
scenario.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
for
example,
whether
the
student
could
have
obstructed
the
visibility
of
the
instructor
in
certain
attitudes,
and
the
like,
those
are
fairly
factual,
i
would
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
right.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
a
matter
of
fact...
that
one
could
easily
say
it's
a
matter
of
fact
that
there
is
a
possibility
that
rollback
occurred.
i
mean,
i...
you
know...
in
other
words,
that
does
not
rule
out
that
one
possibility.
i
know...
really
i
don't
know
what
the
line
is.
