justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we're
really
just
not
discussing
this
in
the
abstract,
are
we?
i
mean,
it's
not
up
to
us.
there
is
a
rule
that
we're
supposed
to
be
following
here.
and
what
content
would
you
give
to
the
limitation
that
appears
in
the
rule,
to
factual
findings?
if
this
assessment
that
in
all
probability,
or
it's
probable
that
rollback
was
the
cause
if
that's
factual
finding,
what
isn't
a
factual
finding?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
never
mind
the
jag
manual.
but
why
would
that
be
any
less
a
factual
finding?
it
was
probable
that
the
cause
was
rollback,
you
say,
that's
a
factual
finding,
but
it's
probable
that
it
was
the
pilot's
fault
would
not
be
a
factual
finding.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
you
mistake
my
problem.
i'm
not
concerned
whether
the
report
calls
that
a
conclusion
or
not.
you
can
have
a
factual
conclusion,
quite
possibly,
which
would
be
a
factual
finding.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
where
do
you
want
us
to
draw
the
line
between
what
is
a
factual
finding,
and
what
is
not
a
factual
finding?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
a
finding
that
the
pilot
was
negligent
would
not
be
a
factual
finding?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
about
the
pilot
failed
to
push
the
stick
to
the
right
when
he
should
have?
would
that
be
a
factual
finding?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
get
more
specific,
as
i
understand
it,
the
writing...
you
didn't
introduce
the
writing,
did
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
just
read
from
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
how
could
he
have
raised
106?
do
you
concede
that
106
does
not
require
that
the
writing
or
recorded
statement
be
introduced
in
evidence?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
you
didn't
introduce
the
document
itself,
you
just
read
from
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
then
he
should--
justice
antonin
scalia
is
his
degree
of
certainty
what
determines
it?
i
mean,
suppose
he
had
said,
well,
actually,
it's
a
close
question
whether
the
weather
had
any
effect
or
not.
the
winds
were
almost
at
the
level
where
they
might
have
had
an
effect,
and
the
clouds
were
almost
low
enough...
but
in
my
opinion,
it
wasn't
a
factor.
then
that
would
no
longer
be
a
factual
finding?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
seems
to
me
that
he's
done
the
same
thing
in
both
situations.
it's
only
his
opinion
in
both
situations.
in
one
case
he's
more
certain
than
he
is
in
the
other,
but
it's
obviously
just
his
judgment
in
each
case,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
suppose
in
the
clear
case
that
you
first
posited,
where
it
was
clear
that
the
weather
wasn't
effected,
he
simply
expressed
himself
by
saying,
it
is
my
firm
opinion
that
weather
was
not
a
factor.
would
that
be
a
factual
point?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
hope
not.
but
i
don't
know
what
we're
turning
on,
if
we're
not
turning
on
that.
what
are
we
turning
on?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
probable
opinions
can
get
in,
then?
is
that
the
line
you're
drawing?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
and
you
wouldn't
allow
any
opinion
to
come
in?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
say
you
would
not
allow
any
opinion
to
come
in?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
define
opinion
as
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
do
with
something
like...
i
have
a
report
that
said,
makes
a
finding
that
the
brake
was
applied...
the
brakes
were
applied
200
feet
before
the
impact,
in
an
automobile
accident.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
it
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
you
wouldn't
say
that,
if
you
apply
the
test
you
gave
me
earlier,
whether
everybody
would
reach
that
conclusion.
suppose
the
investigator
based
that
conclusion
upon
the
fact
that
he
had
an
eyewitness
who
was
in
the
cockpit,
who
said
that
the
pilot
hit
the
stick
with
his
elbow,
accidentally,
causing
the
plane
to
swerve
and
crash...
base
it
on
the
live
testimony
of
someone
who
was
in
the
cockpit.
there
would
be
no
doubt...
every
reasonable
person
would
say
that
the
cause
was
pilot
error.
