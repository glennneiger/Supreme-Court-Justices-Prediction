justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
you're
trying
to
do
in
your
lawsuit
is
to
prove
the
cause
of
the
accident.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
the
accident.
so
is
it
all
that
difficult?
i
guess
it
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it's
not
impossible,
or
you
wouldn't
have
brought
the
lawsuit.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
because
experts
differ
is
some
reason
for
not
allowing
in
this
report?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
fact
that
experts
may
differ,
is
that
a
reason
for
not
allowing
this
report
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
submission
is
that
if
somebody
makes
a
finding
of
cause,
that's
opinion?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
investigator...
looks
around,
looks
at
the
evidence
available
to
him
and
says
that
the
cause
of
this
accident
was
pilot
error.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
you're
wrong?
what
if
you
say
that
cause
is
a
finding
of
fact?
then
it's
in,
under
this
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
that
kind
of
a
statement
by
an
expert
after
examining
a
crash
is
always
supposed
to
be
considered
an
opinion?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
what
basis
did
you
want
the
plaintiffs'
letter
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
objected
to
the
jury
hearing
the
statement
by
rainey
that
he
didn't
think
it
was
pilot
error?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
not
pilot
error?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
did
you
object
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
he's
not
qualified
as
an
expert?
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
investigator,
the
jag
investigator,
was
an
expert?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but--
justice
byron
r.
white
--i
know
but
why
did
he
have
to
be
an
expert
to
testify
as
to
a
fact--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
rather
than
an
opinion,
was
this
opinion
what
you
were
objecting
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
this
was...
the
cause...
his
statement
about
the
cause
of
the
accident
was
an
opinion?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
like
that
was
in
the
jag
expert,
it
was
an
opinion?
not
a
fact?
