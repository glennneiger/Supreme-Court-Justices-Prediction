mr.
larry,
i
guess
some
courts
in
applying
the
rule
have
read
it
to
mean
that
so
long
as
an
official
report
contains
some
factual
findings,
that
then
the
entire
report
is
admissible,
unless
it
is
lacking
in
trustworthiness.
some
courts
have
taken
that
view,
i
take
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
one
could,
i
guess,
read
the
rule
that
way.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
not
to
put
the
letter
in?
and
i
gather,
also,
not
ever
referring,
for
the
benefit
of
the
trial
court,
to
rule
106?
