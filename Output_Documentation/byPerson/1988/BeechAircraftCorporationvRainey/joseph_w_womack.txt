mr.
joseph
w.
womack
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
these
petitions
respectfully
ask
you
to
consider
two
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence.
the
first
is
803,
having
to
do
with
the
use
of
government
reports.
the
second
is
a
different
rule,
namely
106,
concerning
contemporaneous
publication
of
documents.
this,
as
the
court
will
know,
is
essentially
a
codification
of
dean
wigmore's
completeness
formulation.
implicit
in
the
second
point,
if
the
court
please,
is
also
a
different,
a
third
rule,
namely,
801,
and
i
say
implicit
because
it
is
triggered
by
a
footnote
in
the
panel
opinion
of
the
eleventh
circuit.
with
regard
to
803,
namely,
the
government
report
rule,
a
moment
or
two,
please,
of
background.
in
mid-july
of
1982,
a
tragic
accident
involving
the
loss
of
a
navy
trainer,
sadly,
we
lost
a
pilot
and
a
student.
the
following
day,
the
squadron
commander
convened
separate
investigations.
the
one
in
question
here
is
the
jag
investigation
commenced
pursuant
to
the
judge
advocate
general's
manual.
subsequently
suits
were
filed,
diversity
suits
were
filed,
in
the
northern
district
of
florida,
consolidated
for
handling
discovery
and
trial
of
bifurcated
proceedings.
with
trial
in
mid-july
of
1984,
it
was
during
that
trial
that
i
offered,
as
an
exhibit
for
the
jury,
certain
portions
of
the
jag
officer's
report.
historically,
i
think
i
had
brought
that
matter
to
the
district
judge's
notice
several
months
before
the
trial,
at
least
four
months
before
trial.
the
court
considered
the
matter,
brief
were
filed,
it
was
considered
orally
and
in
memoranda.
the
court
ultimately
concluded
that
of
the
31
factual
findings
in
the
jag
report,
that
it
would
admit
or
allow
me
to
use
four.
of
the
nine
conclusions
or
opinions
contained
in
the
jag
report,
the
district
judge
admitted
one.
for
convenience,
i
think
the
full
text
of
the
total
report,
that
is,
the
factual
findings
and
the
conclusions,
are
set
out
in
the
beech
petition.
and
i
raise
this
purely
as
a
matter
of
clarify,
because
the
en
banc
opinion
and
the
panel
opinion
below
both
say...
and
i
think
respectfully,
erroneously,
assume...
that
all
of
the
report
was
admitted,
and
that's
not
correct.
so
if
you
take
the
joint
appendix,
you
have
what
the
court
assumed
to
have
been
admitted,
and
you
take
the
petition
and
you
have
the
exact
document
that
was
admitted.
actually,
after
the
court's
ruling,
i
simply
had
it
retyped,
so
as
not
in
the
heat
of
trial
to
admit
anything
that
the
court
didn't
want
admitted
and
use
it
as
a
blow-up
exploded
exhibit
for
the
jury.
the
specific
bone
of
contention,
if
i
may
put
it
that
way,
is
a
statement
by
the
jag
officer
in
his
conclusions
that
the
probable
cause
of
this
tragedy
was
the
pilot's
failure
to
maintain
proper
interval.
and
by
that
he
means,
of
course,
a
violation
of
the
distances
required
by
pattern
integrity
and
not
touch
and
go
pattern
with
training
squadron.
at
the
time
of
the
accident,
parenthetically,
there
were
six
airplanes
in
the
pattern.
immediately
before
there
had
been
five,
and
when
the
sixth
airplane
entered
the
pattern,
this
tragedy
occurred.
the
court
of
appeals
of
my
circuit...
the
panel
took
it
away
from
me,
took
the
verdict
away
from
me.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
yes,
sir,
yes,
your
honor.
the
panel
reversed.
there
was
a
special
concurrence
by
second
judge
frank
johnson,
suggesting
that
the
court
take
it
en
banc.
we
petitioned,
the
court
recalled
the
panel
opinion,
ordered
new
briefs
filed,
and
ultimately
considered
the
case
further
without
argument,
but
on
new
briefs.
the
en
banc
court
split
six-six
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
conclusion
of
the
jag
officer
classified
or
called,
denominated,
if
you
will,
an
opinion.
relying,
if
the
court
please,
on
a
borrowed
case...
and
i
say
borrowed
because
it
relied
on
a
fifth
circuit
case
which
had
been
decided
prior
to
the
creation
of
the
eleventh
circuit.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
i
think
both
parts
are
admissible,
your
honor.
i
continue.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
803
(6)?
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
i
had
contended
that
they--
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
--were
admissible
under
section
(8).
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
not
to
my
knowledge,
sir.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
that
section,
of
course,
does
deal
with
opinion--
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
just
before
the
recess,
i
had
suggested
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
made
an
erroneous
assumption,
and
so
that
the
court
will
not
think
that
i
am
making
that
assumption,
that's
what
the
court
says
in
the
en
banc
opinion.
in
one
of
the
footnotes,
you'll
notice
that
judge
tjoflat
says
that
they
did
not
have
the
exhibits
before
them.
why
the
appellant
didn't
send
them
up,
or
why
the
court
didn't
call
for
them,
i
cannot
tell
you.
i
simply
say
that
that's
what
he
says
in
the
opinion,
and
that
accounts
for
the
discrepancy
in
what
was
admitted,
what
the
jury
saw,
versus
what
the
court
of
appeals
thought
had
been
put
in
evidence.
lastly,
just
before
the
recess,
i
suggested
that
the
court
had
borrowed
a
fifth
circuit
case.
this,
of
course,
is
smith
v.
ithaca,
and
unless
this
court
says
otherwise,
that
is
the
law
of
our
circuit,
as
we
come
here
today.
my
mission,
as
i
understand
it,
is
to
respectfully
seek
your
approval
to
use
these
types
of
conclusions
or
opinions.
i
make
that
request
to
you,
provided
they
are
trustworthy.
in
this
case,
please
consider
that
my
opponents
had
four
months'
notice.
they
filed
documents
with
the
court
suggesting
that
they
wanted
to
challenge
the
trustworthiness
of
the
jag
investigator.
i
agreed
at
the
conference
before
the
court
that
they
might
add
additional
witnesses
if
they
needed
to
do
that,
to
challenge
the
trustworthiness
of
it,
and
his
honor
twice
indicated
that
he
would
consider
any
precautionary
instruction
which
they
wished
to
hand
up.
nothing
was
done.
no
discovery
was
taken,
no
motion
to
continue,
and
no
witness
was
called.
in
those
circumstances--
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
--none
whatsoever,
your
honor.
now
it
may
be
that
in
a
symbolic
way,
we
as
lawyers
are
not
laying
the
right
predicates
on
trustworthiness.
in
that--
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
--i
submit
that
i
make
the
threshold
showing
that
it's
legitimate,
authentic,
done
in
the
course
and
scope
of
the
officer's
duties,
and
so
forth.
and
then,
if
they
wish
to
challenge
it,
it
should
shift
to
them.
and
i
would
be
the
first
to
encourage
every
precaution
or
every
right
be
given
them
to
do
all
of
the
things
that
they
wish
to
challenge.
the
fact
is,
in
this
case,
none
of
those
things
were
done.
if
i
could
move
to
another
point,
please,
i
think
that
we
as
lawyers
are
not
focusing
on
the
right
thing.
i
suggest
methodology,
experience,
training
of
the
investigator,
the
content
of
the
reports,
the
intended
use,
perhaps,
institutional
bias
if
that
exists,
probative
weight,
and
lastly,
prejudice,
undue
prejudice,
that
might
inure.
and
those
things,
rather
than
the
agency
or
scope
of
employment
of
the
government
investigator,
would
give
a
more
trustworthy
foundation
for
the
district
judge.
moving
quickly,
if
i
may,
to
the
generic
issue,
whether
this
court
will
permit
us
to
use
probable
cause
conclusions,
i
ask
your
approval
for
that
use.
and
i
ask
you
to
consider
several
reasons.
first,
they
are
certainly
not
binding
on
anybody
in
a
judicial
sense.
the
committee
recommends
their
use,
most
of
the
circuits
permit
their
use,
and
indeed
in
the
fifth
and
the
second
circuit,
while
there
are
cases
going
in
both
directions,
they
are
permitted
there.
most
of
the
evidence
professors
say
that
we
should
be
able
to
use
them.
gainsaid,
that's
not
binding
on
this
court,
obviously.
but
there
are
some
very
good
policy
reasons
for
doing
so,
quite
aside
from
what
the
evidence
professors
might
have
to
say.
some
cases
of
necessity
cost...
the
sheer
volume
of
paperwork
generated
by
business
and
government
today
is
just
overpowering,
and
so
i
submit
in
the
most
respectful
terms
that
we,
who
try
cases,
need
to
be
able
to
use
in
some
form
some
portions
of
government
documents.
however
strict
the
court
might
feel
on
trustworthiness
before
you
allow
us
to
use
them,
that's
a
matter
for
the
court,
and
not
for
us.
but
there
is
an
overriding
need
for
our
use
of
these
documents.
in
a
practical
sense,
please
consider
also
that
if
you
allow
a
conclusion
or
an
opinion
that's
probable
cause,
and
doesn't
go
past
the
line
to
the
fixation
of
liability
or
legal
conclusions,
if
you
just
let
us
use
probable
cause,
i
submit
to
you
that
the
district
judges
deal
with
this
on
a
daily
basis.
the
cautionary
charges
can
be
given
almost
from
note.
the
trial
lawyers
know
how
to
handle
them
without
any
difficulty.
and
lastly,
and
i
think
perhaps
importantly,
the
jurors
deal
with
economic
probabilities,
mathematical
probabilities,
medical
probabilities,
on
a
daily
basis.
so
i
submit
there's
nothing
exotic
or
esoteric
about
allowing
a
fact-finder
to
have
those
kinds
of
conclusions,
provided
there
are
ample,
indeed,
even
stringent
terms
going
to
probabilities,
to
trustworthiness,
excuse
me.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
i
think
if
the
jag
officer
had
gone
further
and
tried
to
attach
liability
for
the
accident,
that
that
would
have
been
going
too
far,
both
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
it
would
be
contrary
to
the
jag
manual
itself,
which
forbids
such
a
conclusion.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
for
my
part,
your
honor,
i
thought
the
jag
officer's
finding
in
this
case
was
a
factual
evaluation.
but
it
is
denominated
in
this
report
as
a
conclusion
or
opinion,
because
the
catalog,
the
protocol
of
the
jag
manual
requires
them
to
be
set
out
under
certain
headings.
now,
if
your
honor's
question,
the
reach
of
the
court's
question
is,
was
this
jag
officer's
terminology,
his
verbiage
in
this
case,
consistent
only
with
my
theory
of
the
case,
the
answer
is
no,
sir.
was
it
compatible
with
the
respondent's
case
below?
the
answer
is
yes.
for
two
weeks,
they
litigated
the
case
below,
that
the
airplane
got
from
point
a
to
point
b
and
behaved
as
it
did
aerodynamically,
because
of
an
engine
problem.
to
be
sure,
i
litigated
with
every
fiber
of
my
being
pilot
error.
but
the
jury,
according
to
their
verdict,
never
got
that
far.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
i
would
ask
you--
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
--i
think
a
finding
that
the
pilot
was
negligent
would
be
too
close
to
a
legal
conclusion.
i
think
if
you
give
the
fact-finder
the
bit
of
evidence
that
this
is
a
probable
cause,
and
then
let
them
defend
against
that,
that
that's
proper.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
if
the
jag
officer
says
that
the
probable,
a
probable
cause,
or
the
probable
cause,
was
the
pilot's
failure
to
input
aileron,
i
think
that
that
would
be
a
factual
finding
that
they
should
be
able
to
consider.
and
to
answer
the
bottom
line
question
of
your
honor,
i
would
ask
you
to
consider
drawing
the
line,
if
the
court
chooses
to
draw
a
line,
just
on
the
other
side
of
probabilities
and
just
this
side
of
legal
conclusions
and
fixation
of
legal
liability.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
i
thought
they
intended
to
exclude
legal
conclusions
or
fixation.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
legal
determinations
of
legal
responsibility.
and
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
most
of
the
evidence
writers,
and
most
of
the
circuits
have
said
that
this
type
of
conclusion,
opinion,
finding,
or
however
denominated,
is
really
a
specie
of
factual
findings.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
well,
judge
weinstein,
a
much-loved
authority
on
evidence,
makes
the
very
point
that
the
district
judge
should
not
be
put
in
the
position
of
drawing
what
he
calls
"hairsplitting
conclusions"
or
factual
evaluations.
it's
almost
impossible
to
do,
according
to
his
honor's
view,
and
it's
better
to
admit
it
under
caution,
under
tight
restraints
of
trustworthiness,
with
cautionary
instructions.
now,
that's
the
majority
view,
but
as
i
said
to
your
honor
before,
it's
certainly
not
binding
on
this
court.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
if
i
may
paraphrase
his
honor,
he
said
that
was
a
possible
scenario.
in
other
words,
to
his
eye,
a
possibility
was
not
reliable
enough
for
him.
that's
the
way
i
read--
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
--justice
stevens,--
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
--i
offered
the
entire
jag
report.
i
wanted
them
all
in.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
that's
what
i
urged
for
four
months,
in
writing,
and
in
every
way
that
i
could.
his
honor
did
not
agree
with
me.
he
considered
the
matter
for
a
long
period
of
time.
ultimately...
changed
his
ruling
once,
and
ultimately
edited
the
report
himself.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
the
plaintiff
objected
to
the
conclusion,
as
i
recall.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
number
(7),
yes,
sir,
he
did.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
i
don't
think
he
did,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
i
don't
mean
to
speak
for
him,
and
mr.
larry
will
certainly
know.
you
may
rely
on
what
he
says
that--
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
--if
your
honor
please,
the
next
has
to
do
with
what
i
call
the
paper
rule...
this
is
106,
which
says
in
substance
that
if
one
offers
part
of
a
document
or
transcript
or
letter,
that
type
of
thing,
and
the
advisory
or
opponent
of
the
document
wishes
the
other
parts
offered,
it
must
be
done
at
that
time.
as
i
read
it,
it
says
"contemporaneously".
as
i've
indicated
to
you,
dean
wigmore
and
professor
mccormick,
judge
weinstein
and
other
authors
interpret
it
that
way.
in
this
situation,
the
eleventh
circuit,
with
all
due
respect,
if
their
opinion
stands,
they
have
converted
rule
106
to
a
substantive
evidence
rule,
and
that
rule
would
run
along
the
theme
that
106
is
converted
to
a
theme
of
one's
case
doctrine,
or
that
one
can
give
unqualified
opinions,
so
long
as
they
are
consistent
with
one's
trial
stance
or
one's
trial
theory.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
i
think
that
the
subject
of
an
engine
opinion,
the
technical
opinion
which
he
was
asked,
or
which
he
tried
to
express,
was
a
professional
opinion.
now,
if
they
thought
that
they
could
qualify
that
filer
as
an
expert,
then
they
should
have
tried
to
lay
that
predicate,
or
perhaps
put
him
on
in
their
case
if
they
wanted
to,
or
call
him
in
rebuttal.
they
could
have
made
the
effort.
i
would
not
agree
that
he
was
qualified
to
do
that,
and
i
make
that
suggestion
to
your
honor
because
they
called
dr.
craig
as
an
aerodynamicist,
and
they
called
mr.
hall
as
their
engine
expert.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
that's
ground
one.
and
ground
two,
please
consider,
that
if
they
had
questions
to
ask
of
rainey
which
were
related
to
generic
question
subject
matter
that
we
had
opened
up,
then
i
think
they
could
have
gotten
in
other
parts
of
that
letter,
whatever
its
status
as
hearsay.
for
example--
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
--i
say
that--
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
--well,
that
court
of
appeals
says
what
we
did
was
tantamount
to
offering.
i
don't
agree
with
that,
but
that's
what
the
court
said
and
i'm
bound
by
it,
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
well,
maybe
that's
the
wrong
word
to
use.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
yes,
yes.
i
thought
that
the
use
of
the
letter,
if
at
all,
if
i
may
put
it
that
way,
must
have
been
invoked
at
that
time,
treated
at
that
time,
and
had
to
be
related
to
the
subject
matter
which
we
had
opened
up.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
i
did
not
think
that
you
could
change
subject
matter,
or
bring
in
new
subject
matter,
much
less
professional
opinions
about
spool
turbines.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
yes,
sir.
if
he
had
triggered
106,
and
told
the
trial
judge
at
that
time
that
he
was
doing
that,
then
the
court
would
have
taken
the
letter,
looked
at
what
we
asked,
then
looked
at
what
was
said,
and
made
a
ruling
based
on
106.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
if
it
was
germane
to
the
subject
matters
opened
up.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
that's--
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
--no,
sir,
i
have
not.
the
first
citing
of
106
was
in
the
post-trial
motions,
and
i'm
saying
to
the
court
that
that's
not
timely.
it's
too
late.
you've
got...
you
ought
to
be
required
to
warn
the
district
judge,
so
that
he
can
compare
and
make
a
reasoned
ruling,
not
catch
him
by
surprise
on
post-trial
motions.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
no,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
no,
your
honor.
i
can't
envision
any
circumstance
under
which
i
would
put
an
adversary's
investigatory
letter
into
evidence.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
in
my
awkwardness,
i'm
not
getting
my
point
across,
and
that's
my
fault.
i
didn't
think
that
106
was
usable
at
all,
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
that's
right.
but
the
court
of
appeals
says
that
my
point
is
not
well
taken.
now,
if
you
assume
that
i
am
wrong,
and
if
they
were
going
to
allow
its
use
as
a
106
proposition--
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
--if
i
have
any
time,
i
would
like
to
reserve
it,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
with
the
court's
permission,
i
made
the
decision
to
call
mr.
john
rainey
as
an
adverse
party,
since
he
had
not
testified
at
all,
called
for
the
purpose
of
getting
him
to
make
admissions
against
interest,
which
i
thought
were
contained
in
the
letter
which
he
had
written.
the
witness
was
shown
two
documents.
one
was
a
statement
from
the
marine
captain
named
guthrie,
the
other
was
the
letter
which
he,
mr.
rainey,
had
written,
and
which
he
and
mrs.
knowlton
had
signed.
that
is
the
one
that's
in
issue
here.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
i
objected
to
his
making
the
statement
that
the
cause
of
the
accident
was
rollback
which
is
a
technical
term.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
why
did
i
object
to
it?
because
he
was
not
qualified.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
yes,
sir.
he
was
not
qualified.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
that
comes
in
under
the...
a
separate
route,
if
i
may
put
it
that
way,
under
the
rule
as
we
understood
it.
but
you
don't
take
a
lay
witness--
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
--and
guess
him
to
fall
into
the
same
category.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
because
the
engine
testimony--
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
--opinion,
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
w.
womack
yes,
your
honor,
but
one
was
qualified
under
the
rule,
and
one
was
not,
in
my
judgment.
