brennan,
jr.
but,
your
argument,
mr.
womack,
as
i
understand
your
brief,
is
that
rule
106
is
inapplicable
anyway,
because
he
never
mentioned
it
or
raised
it.
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
you
abandoned
that
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
settle
for
the
trial
judge
setting
up,
"these
are
my
findings
of
fact,
a,
b,
c,
d,
e;
the
rest
are
opinion?
