mr.
dennis
k.
larry
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court,
rule
803(8)(c)
has
been
variously
described
by
the
courts
in
these
ways:
first
and
foremost
as
a
mighty
litigation
tool.
i
believe
that
the
issue
before
this
court
is
for
it
to
decide
how
mighty
will
be
the
litigation
tool
found
in
803(8)(c).
it
has
been
termed
by
the
advisory
committee
as
a
controversial
rule.
it
has
been
called
by
courts
a
complex
rule.
and
how
to
interpret
factual
findings,
was
obviously,
as
the
brief
set
forth,
a
matter
on
which
the
house
and
the
senate
could
not
agree.
the
point
of
rainey
and
knowlton
at
this
proceeding,
is
that
while
that
rule
was
intended
to
make
available
to
the
jury
factual
findings
that
could
be
helpful
to
that
jury,
that
were
reached
by
an
investigator
in
the
course
of
an
investigation,
that
that
rule
was
never
intended
by
the
framers
to
permit
the
garden
variety,
pure
expert
opinion,
that
normally
comes
in
through
witnesses
who
are
qualified
as
experts,
who
are
revealed
in
the
discovery
process
as
experts,
who
are
routinely
deposed
prior
to
trial
as
experts,
and
who
must
be
qualified
by
the
court--
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
--justice
o'connor,
the
only
case
i
know
of,
other
than
judge
tjofiat,
who
wrote
a
concurring
opinion
in
this
case,
that
discuss
that
at
all
was
zenith
v.
matsushita.
it
may
have
been
discussed
in
others,
but
my
recollection
of
what
the
court
there
said
was
that
one
could
read
it
that
way.
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
yes,
ma'am.
yes,
justice.
however,
the
court
goes
on
in
the
same
case
to
say,
however,
it
appears
clear
that
what
was
intended
was
only
to
admit
them
to
the
extent
of
their
factual
findings,
and
that's
the
construction
that
we
urge
here.
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
justice
rehnquist,
i
believe
that
this
court,
i
believe
that
courts,
can
see
a
difference,
and
can
distinguish
between
what
an
investigator
finds
as
a
fact,
based
upon
his
evaluation
of
evidence,
and
what
is
pure
opinion.
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
your
honor,
what
we
want
is
for
the
trial
judge
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
the
report
qualities
under
the
rule,
and
not
simply
let
the
entire
report
in
just
because
in
some
cases,
it
may
be
difficult
to
distinguish
between
opinion
and
fact.
i
think
that
what
we
have
here
is
a
rule
that
carefully
used
words,
"findings
of
fact",
and
never
used
the
word
"opinion"
in
any
of
the
advisory
committee
notes.
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
i
think
the
judge,
when
the
report
is
offered,
has
to
decide
whether
the
report
sets
forth
more
than
findings
of
fact.
and
the
cases,
and
the
advisory
committee
notes,
do
offer
a
helpful
guide
to
the
judge
in
determining
the
kind
of
finding
of
facts
that
was
envisioned
by
the
framers.
the
advisory
committee
note
to
rule
803(6)...
and
this
gets
into,
of
course,
the
analysis
of
smith
v.
ithaca,
but
it's
relevant
to
your
point,
justice...
if
803(6)
recognized
that
prior
to
the
federal
rules
of
evidence,
opinions
simply
didn't
come
in
in
most
courts,
or
at
least
in
many
federal
courts,
and
they
took
care
in
the
note
to
say,
"because
we
recognize
that
courts
have
turned
away
records
to
the
extent
of
their
opinions,
we
want
it
to
be
specifically
clear
here
that
opinions
and
diagnoses
are
included.
"
moving
on
to
803(8)(c),
the
very
same
hearsay
exception,
but
there
is
a
slightly
different
subdivision,
they
recognize,
again,
evaluative
reports
have
become
controversial.
yet
they
never
reach
the
point
of
saying,
and
we
simply
want
to
open
up
the
door
to
all
opinion.
what
they
do
is
analyze
the
kinds
of
evaluative
reports
that
statutorily
had
been
permitted...
for
example,
secretary
of
agriculture
findings
as
to
the
true
grade
of
grain,
recognizing
that
that
kind
of
an
opinion,
by
the
secretary,
or
that
kind
of
a
statement
by
the
secretary,
to
some
extent
involves
some
conclusory
process.
a
finding
or
a
certificate
that
a
ship
was
sanitary
enough
to
accept
a
cargo
of
beans...
admissible
under
statute...
far
different
from
a
probable
cause
opinion,
nevertheless
slightly
more
than
simply
factual.
and
the
advisory
committee
looks
to
those
statutory
exceptions
and
says,
"this
is
our
helpful
guide
in
deciding
the
kinds
of
reports
we
think
ought
to
be
admitted.
"
they
call
them
evaluative
findings,
or
evaluative
reports.
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
i
have
the
advisory
committee
note
in
front
of
me.
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
have
the
page
handy.
i'm
sorry.
the
jag
investigator
was
bound
by
a
jag
manual,
which
coincidentally
required
him
to
reach
findings
of
fact
separately
from
opinions
and
conclusions.
and
interestingly,
also,
it
defined
a
finding
of
fact
as
the
investigator's
evaluation
of
evidence,
but
not
his
opinion
or
his
inference
as
to
what
all
of
the
evidence
might
mean...
in
this
case,
in
terms
of
causation.
the
jag
manual,
by
its
terms,
contemplates
that
the
findings
of
fact
would
be
evaluative,
but
it
takes
care
to
separate
that
from
opinion.
i
think
that
if
the
court
examines
the
jag
investigation
in
this
case,
it
well
illustrates
the
distinction
between
the
kinds
of
findings
that
this
advisory
committee
intended,
and
the
opinions
which
we
contend
this
court
should
not
permit
to
become
a
tool
for
litigators.
in
the
report,
a
lot
of
historical
facts
are
recited...
for
example,
the
date,
the
time
and
the
place
of
the
accident...
facts
with
which
there
is
no
evaluation
process
at
all.
he
then
moves
on
to
such
things
as
was
the
weather
a
factor,
and
as
a
factual
finding,
he
concludes
that
because
the
winds
and
the
temperatures
and
all
were
not
cut
of
the
ordinary,
that
for
a
pilot,
weather
couldn't
have
been
a
factor.
and
he
makes
that
a
finding
of
fact.
he
doesn't
say
"it's
my
opinion,
but
it's
possible
it
was.
"
he
simply
says,
factually,
weather
wasn't
a
factor.
he
goes
on
to
say
that--
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
--in
that
sense,
he
is
telling
the
reader
of
his
report
that
it
simply
isn't
a
factual
finding
of
his.
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
it
is
true
that
when
an
investigator
makes
a
finding
or
an
evaluation
by
factual
determination,
he
is
injecting
a
judgment
process,
which
is
involved
in
opinion,
and
gets
more
and
more
involved
the
more
you
get
into
the
kind
of
opinion
that
was
admitted
here.
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
the
court
could
very
well
determine
that
although
he
called
it
an
opinion,
he
simply
made
a
finding
of
fact.
i
don't
think
we
can
turn
on
what
the
investigator
called
it.
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
what
i'm
suggesting
to
the
court
is
that
as
the
advisory
committee
evaluated
or
revalued
the
kinds
of
reports
that
have
been
previously
admitted
by
statute,
and
still
were
preserved,
that
this
is
the
kind
of
report
that
may
contain
some
conclusory,
may
tend
toward
the
conclusory,
but
which
nevertheless
is
the
investigator's
statement
of
fact
that
that's
what
it
was.
the
case
of
zenith
v.
matsushita,
which
was
cited
in
all
the
briefs,
makes
that
statement
that
factual
findings
is
a
term
broad
enough
to
encompass
any
statement
of
fact
that
represents
a
conclusion
on
the
part
of
the
investigator.
now,
lieutenant
commander
morgan
after
going
beyond
the
findings
of
fact
then
lists
his
opinions,
and
makes
it
clear
in
his
scenario
of
the
opinions
that
it
is
impossible
for
him
to
know
for
a
fact
how
the
accident
happened,
why
it
happened.
if
i
may
quote
from
number
five,
"because
both
pilots
were
killed
in
the
crash,
and
because
of
the
nearly
total
destruction
of
the
aircraft
by
fire,
it
is
impossible...
almost
impossible...
to
determine
exactly
what
happened.
"
he
goes
on
to
engage
in
what
he
calls
a
possible
scenario,
which
is
what
he
later
calls
his
probable
cause
opinion:
he
sets
up
the
scenario
that
the
pilot,
surprised
by
the
presence
of
another
aircraft,
race
a
hard
right
turn
and
put
the
aircraft
in
stall.
he
then
goes
on
to
say
that
the
most
probable
cause
was
just
that
possible
scenario
that
i've
just
cited,
and
states
also,
"i
can't
rule
out
the
possibility
that
rollback
occurred.
"
and
to
address
the
question
that
was
raised
during
beech's
presentation,
the
judge
initially
ruled,
and
had
ruled
in
his
pre-trial
order
up
until
the
day
after
jury
selection
and
the
day
before
the
first
witness,
that
only
what
lieutenant
commander
morgan
had
called
his
factual
findings
would
come
into
evidence.
he
said
that
opinions
would
have
no
place
in
the
courtroom.
then
he
reversed
that,
and
as
beech
pointed
out,
we
were
given
the
opportunity
for
that
short
period
of
time
to
try
to
do
what
we
could
to
attack
trustworthiness,
which
we
had
made
clear
we
thought
was
an
issue
with
respect
to
opinions.
he
stated,
"i
will
not
allow
all
opinions
in,
only
to
the
extent
they're
couched
in
the
terms
of
probability.
"
because
in
florida,
and
i
think
in
other
states,
experts
are
not
entitled
to
opine
on
what
they
think
possibly
could
have
happened,
only
what
they
think
probably
happened.
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
justice
rehnquist,
our
contention
is
that
before
trustworthiness
is
ever
reached
as
an
issue,
the
findings,
the
factual
findings,
have
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
rule,
and
that,
unless
it
is
determined
that
what
is
offered
is
a
factual
finding,
you
never
get
to
trustworthiness,
with
respect
to
attacking
the
opinions.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
some
time
was
taken
in
pointing
out
the
various
purposes
that
are
served
by
allowing
investigative
findings
of
fact
into
evidence,
and
the
suggestion
that
our
contention
would
somehow
disserve
those
policy
reasons
for
allowing
the
report.
one
of
the
reasons
given
that
these
reports
should
be
admissible
is
because
the
officer
who
does
it
comes
on
the
scene
early.
that
purpose
is
nowhere
offended
by
our
position.
other
investigators
hired
by
the
parties
are
partial.
no
quarrel
with
that.
the
investigator
by
the
time
of
the
trial
i
may
have
a
dim
recollection
of
what
he
did...
again,
no
quarrel
with
that.
his
factual
findings,
to
the
extent
that
they
are
factual,
will
still
be
there,
for
them
to
come
into
evidence,
in
lieu
of
his
dim
recollection.
points
that
the
cases,
and
the
commentators
point
to
the
fact
that
the
investigator
can
interview
witnesses
before
the
parties
have
pulled
them
to
one
side
or
another.
again,
that
doesn't
offend
his
findings
of
fact.
that
simply
says
that
that's
why
this
investigator's
findings
may
be
something
that
we
should
admit,
and
oftentimes
the
officer
is
trained
in
doing
this
kind
of
investigation.
but
none
of
these
purposes
speak
to
and
encourage
that
this
factual
findings
language
should
be
extended
to
include
all
opinion,
and
simply
leave
it
up
to
the
opponent
to
say,
well,
if
the
opinion's
not
trustworthy.
i
think
the
wording
has
to
have
some
meaning
other
than
everything
in
the
world
of
opinion
comes
in.
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
justice,
you're
not
completely
correct
in
that
point.
i
am
saying
in
this
case
that
lieutenant
commander
morgan
took
care
to
place
certain
things
in
his
findings
of
fact
section,
but
i
don't
believe
that
this
court
should
adopt
a
rule
that
draws
a
bright
line
to
be
determined
by
what
the
investigator
calls
it.
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
because
one
investigator
here
could
have
said,
"i
find
as
a
fact
that
lieutenant
commander
rainey
stalled
this
aircraft
and
caused
her
own
death.
"
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
your
honor,
the
judge
found
in
that
case,
and
we
agreed
with
him,
that
there
wasn't
really
any
way
for
that
investigator
to
know
a
lot
of
those
things
that
he
was
talking
about
were
possible,
who
was...
whether
the
student
overpowered
the
instructor,
or
whether
the--
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
--well,
there
weren't
any
finding...
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
there
were
no
factual
findings
in
those
respects.
i
believe
that's
why
the
court
felt
that
was
simply
too
much
of
a
possible
scenario
for
him
to
say
that
comes
in.
but
interestingly
enough,
once
the
lieutenant
commander
morgan
stopped
calling
it
a
possible
scenario,
and
then
called
it
his
probable
cause
opinion,
then
that
did
it.
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
if
that
expert
had
been
on
the
stand,
i
could
have
asked
him,
"sir,
you
have
to
agree
with
me,
don't
you,
that
you
can't
rule
out
that
rollback
happened?
"
now,
that's
something
that
would
occur
in
a
courtroom.
but
the
court
was
unwilling
to
do
anything
except
allow,
once
he
had
decided
opinions
would
come
in,
to
allow
anything
but
probable
cause,
probability
opinions.
no
more
than
i
could
put
an
expert
on
the
stand
and
ask
this
expert
his
opinion
as
to
the
possibility
of
the
cause
was.
i
don't
think
i'd
be
permitted
to
do
that.
that's
impeachment
kind
of
questioning,
but
it's
not
what
you
could
do
on
direct.
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
your
honor,
that's
the
line
that
the
judge
drew
as
to
why
that
opinion
would
come
in
and
not
the
possible
scenarios.
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
he
did
allow
opinion
to
come
in.
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
that's
correct.
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
i
would
ask
the
parties
to
bring
the
experts
who
want
to
express
those
opinions
to
court.
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
if
that
was
based
upon
a
skid
mark--
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
--that
was
200
feet
long,
then
you've
entered
into
the
realm
of
where
an
investigator
can
tend
toward
the
conclusory,
but
still
establish
it
as
a
fact.
if
he
can
establish
that
the
skidmark
belonged
to
that
automobile...
it's
what
one
of
the
cases
talks
about
is
the
kind
of
a
conclusion
that
all
persons
skilled
in
the
art
would
likely
agree
with.
i
believe
that
was
the
language
from
skogen.
when
you
get
into
the
causation
issues,
like
we
have
here,
where
nobody
knows
the
cause,
and
the
opinions
from
experts
go
both
ways,
and
where
the
evidence...
much
of
it...
is
destroyed,
in
the
sense
that
the
aircraft
burns
up...
you
can't
have
the
kind
of
opinions
that
this
court
or
any
trial
judge
could
say,
"this
is
the
kind
of
opinion
all
persons
skilled
would
likely
agree
with.
"
i
think
the
advisory
committee
intended
to
encompass
maybe
that
much,
but
stay
clear
of
saying
that
this
kind
of
garden
variety
expert
opinion,
that
we
take
great
pains--
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
--that
would
not
be
a
factual
finding
reached
by
an
investigator
pursuant
to
law.
that
wouldn't
come
under
803(8)(c).
no.
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
well,
803(8)(c)
speaks
only
to
reports
of
investigations
containing
factual
findings,
and
i
don't
think
that
that's
what
that
would
be.
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
that's
correct.
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
is
it
all
that
difficult
to
prove
the
cause?
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
that's
correct.
but
it
becomes
a
matter
of
very
hotly
contested
expert
opinion,
as
this
record
amply
demonstrates.
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
it
was
a
very,
very...
and
the
sole
issue,
really,
for
the
jury,
whether
you
call
it
a
legal
conclusion--
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
--i'm
sorry,
i
missed
the
first
part.
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
your
honor...
no.
the
reason
for
not
allowing
this
report
in
is
because
this
opinion...
not
the
findings
of
fact...
is
because
it's
not
a
finding
of
fact
and
the
investigator
signals
that--
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
--if
it
is...
if
it
goes
beyond
a
normative...
if
it
goes
beyond--
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
--that's
opinion
and
doesn't
come
in
under
this
rule.
that's
our
contention.
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
if
the
investigator
calls
it...
calls
cause
a
finding
of
fact,
i
don't
think
that
changes
that
it
is--
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
--well,
i
think
that's
true.
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
well,
in
your
example,
i
think
that
i
would
differ
with
that,
because
i
don't
think
that
part
would
be
enough
to
answer
the
whole
question.
but
i
agree
with
your
honor,
there
are
cases
in
which
it
could
be
established
as
a
fact...
for
example,
in
a
case
of
a
shooting
death.
one
could
conclude
as
a
fact
that
death
resulted
from
a
bullet
wound
in
the
heart.
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
well,
it
is...
that
again
gets
into
that
area
that
is
called
the
kind
of
opinion,
the
kind
of
conclusion
that
all
persons
similarly
skilled
would
reach.
it
is
very
apparent
that
the
people
skilled
in
the
art
of
forensics
and
medical
examiner
training
would
agree
on.
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
your
honor,
i'm
making
two
points.
first,
under
smith
v.
ithaca,
which
is
a
very
strict
construction
approach
which
we
urge
on
this
court,
any
opinion
doesn't
come
in.
the
second
point
which
has
become...
i've
allowed
it
to
become
kind
of
confused,
and
i
apologize...
is
that
even
if
you
adopt
the
senate
view,
the
advisory
committee
view,
that
evaluative
reports
come
in,
that
they
even
suggest
there
should
be
some
limit
on
the
kind
of
opinion,
call
it
opinion,
that
should
come
in
as
a
factual
finding.
and
that's
why
i
pointed
the
court
to
the
kinds
of
things
the
advisory
committee
said
should
be
a
helpful
guide,
and
they
talk
about
some
very
easy-to-resolve
questions
of
would
this
be
the
kind
of
thing
that
anyone
would
really
disagree
with,
is
what
i
suggest.
if
they
had
intended
for
this
rule
to
be
a
vehicle
to
place
in
this
kind
of
opinion...
pure
opinion...
then
i
think
that
they
should
have
said
that,
and
i
think
that
this
court,
as
the
supreme
court
of
this
land,
ought
to
be
cautious
in,
by
implication
of
a
rule
or
a
statute,
extending
it
to
the
point
that
very
important
rights
of
cross-examination
are
cut
off.
and
that's
what
beech
is
urging
this
court
to
do,
is
to
take
this
rule
of
factual
finding--
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
--your
honor,
the
only
choice
that
we
had
to
do
that
was
to
seek
a
continuance.
we
did
not
do
that,
and
for
that
reason
we
cannot
here
complain
that
we're
entitled
to
a
new
trial
because
we
were
surprised.
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
well,
your
honor,
even
under
this
rule,
if
i
had
deposed
him,
i
still
can't
cross-examine
his
in
front
of
the
jury.
i
can
cross-examine
him
in
the
deposition,
but
just
because
i've
taken
this
deposition
doesn't
prevent
beech
from
bringing
that
report
in
and
just
simply
putting
it
in.
and
before
that
jury,
i
may
not
cross-examine
it.
i
have
to
read
a
deposition
that
i
took
in
iowa,
or
someplace,
some
months
before
the
trial.
now
we
readily
concede
that
if
we
thought
surprise
entitled
us
to
a
new
trial,
we
forgave
that
right,
forewent
that
right.
but
i
made
some
discussion
in
the
briefs
addressing
the
circumstances
under
which
this
change
in
ruling
was
announced,
in
order
to
draw
attention
to
the
fact
that
we
never
conceded
that
the
opinions
were
trustworthy.
we
didn't
sit
around
not
caring
whether
they
came
in.
we
had
a
ruling
from
a
federal
district
judge
in
writing
saying
they
wouldn't
come
in,
and
granted
beech
continued
to
press
the
point.
we
didn't
anticipate
the
judge
would
charge
the
ruling.
that's
again,
not
mentioned
that
to
say
we're
entitled
to
a
new
trial
for
that
reason,
but
to
let
this
court
know,
and
not
be
under
the
mistaken
assumption
that
we
simply
conceded
it
and
now
complain
about
it.
that
is
not
the
case,
and
the
joint
appendix
contains
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
before
the
judge
when
he
did
change
his
mind,
and
we
made
it
clear,
mr.
hardington
made
it
clear
in
that
hearing,
that
we
did
not
concede
the
trustworthiness
of
those
opinions.
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
your
honor,
the
letter
we
wanted
in
because
beech
had
introduced
rainey's
letter.
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
they
did--
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
--they
introduced
the
letter,
not
the
document.
but
by
the
verbatim
reading
from
it,
with
the
letter
in
front
of
them,
saying
"mr.
rainey,
did
you
not
say
as
follows.
"
reading
verbatim
what
he
said.
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
from
the
letter,
the
document
itself.
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
i'm
referring
to
the
letter.
the
letter
was
part
of
the
jag
composite.
all
the
enclosures
included
that
lieutenant
commander
rainey
had
written
to
the
jag
a
letter
concerning
what
his
investigation,
although
not
an
eyewitness--
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
--yes,
your
honor.
i
do
ask
you
to
say
that,
because
in
effect
what
they
did
was
avoid
putting
it
in,
by
reading
it.
but
it
came
to
the
jury
with
the
very
same
wording
that
was
in
the
letter.
and
all
we
asked
to
do,
immediately
following
that,
on
redirect,
was
to
say,
you've
been
asked
these
questions
that
support,
we
didn't
say
these
words,
but
supported
beech's
theory
of
the
case.
did
you
not
also
say,
in
your
letter?
and
i
began
to
read
verbatim
from
that.
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
i
asked
for
the
opportunity
to
read
it
in
the
same
way
beech
had
done.
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
your
honor,
i
never
mentioned
the
rule
to
the
judge,
but
he
had
the
benefit
of
my
thinking,
which
really
went
to
the
substance
of
106.
what
i
said
to
the
judge
was,
"your
honor,
he
has
had
the
ability.
"
this
is
at
page
77
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
mr.
toothman
for
beech
said:
"i
object
to
his
arguing".
i
said
to
the
judge,
"may
i
be
heard
on
this?
"
the
court
said,
"yes,
sir,
go
ahead.
"
whereupon
i
said,
"on
the
basis
that
this
letter
constitutes
an
admission
by
commander
rainey,
he
has
been
asked
to
answer
every
single
question
mr.
toothman
had,
respecting.
"
and
i
was
then
cut
off
by
the
judge.
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
your
honor,
it
is
true
that
i
didn't
use
those
words,
and
i
don't
believe
that
the
prevailing
authority
requires
that
at
that
time,
i
cite
a
rule
of
evidence.
i
think
that
what
it
requires
is
that
i
make
known
to,
under
103,
make
known
to
the
judge
what
the
substances
of
the
testimony
i
want
to
elicit
from
the
witness
is.
that,
the
eleventh
circuit
found,
i
did,
by
the
way
in
which
the
question
was
framed.
mr.
dennis
k.
larry
there
are,
no,
there
are
a
number
of
cases
cited
in
the
briefs,
going
to
the
106
issue,
and
the
only
case
that
i
found
that
held
that
the
party
not
only
had
to
tell
the
judge
what
the
substance
was,
but
also
why...
whether
a
specific
rule
had
to
be
mentioned...
was
the
case
of
tate
v.
robbins
&
meyers,
which
is
a
first
circuit
case
in
1986,
found
at
709
f
2nd
10.
and
that
was
the
only
case
that
i
found
cited.
