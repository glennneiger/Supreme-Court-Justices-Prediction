justice
byron
r.
white
just
so
i
get
it
straight,
you
talk
about
overbreadth.
what's
your
position
on
whether
the
conduct
or
the...
these...
this...
what
this
father
did...
is
it
protected
or
unprotected?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
certainly
wasn't
under
the
statute.
i
gather.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
the
statute
would
certainly
forbid
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
that
it's...
it
could
constitutionally
do
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
have
to
be
in
some
other
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if...
if...
if
the...
if
the...
if
overbreadth
goes
out
of
the
case
because
the
old
statute
has
been
repealed
and
it
can
no
longer
itself
be
a
deterrent
to
any...
anybody
who
wants
to
engage
in
first
amendment
activities,
the
issue
then
becomes
whether
the
conduct
that
your
client
that
the
chief
justice
asked
about
is
protected
or
not.
and...
and
the
state
court
never
reached
that
issue.
your...
your
client
was...
was
convicted
and
his
conviction
was
reversed
because
the
statute
under
which
he
was
convicted
was
held
invalid
on
its
face.
and
the
court
didn't
reach
the
issue
of
whether
this
particular
conduct
was
protected.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
we
wouldn't
have
to
decide
that.
we
can
go
back
and
we
can...
we
could
remand
that,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
like
the
old
statute
would
be
any
basis
whatsoever
for
a
finding
of
overbreadth.
it's
not
about...
as
justice
scalia
has
said,
it's
just
not
about
to
deter
anybody
else.
it's
gone.
so,
i
don't
know
why
the...
these
cases
that
are
pending
shouldn't
turn
on
the
specific
conduct
that's
at
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
i...
i
know
that,
but
it's
gone.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
reason
for
overbreadth
is--
justice
byron
r.
white
--the
state
has
to
get
rid
of
its...
its
price
for
having
the
statute
unnarrowed
is
you
can't
prosecuted
anybody.
but
once
it's
narrowed,
you
can
prosecute
anyone
you
want.
