we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
87-1651,
massachusetts
v.
douglas
oakes.
general
shannon,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
shannon,
you
mentioned
a
moment
ago
that
the
picture
of
the
toddler
on
the
beach
was
benign.
is...
is...
are
you
saying
it's
protected
by
the
first
amendment
or
that
it
was
just
not
intended
to
be
covered
by
a
sensible
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you're
talking
about
some
conduct
protected
by
some
guarantee
of
privacy,
there
wouldn't
be
any
overbreadth
analysis.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
overbreadth
analysis
comes
only
with
the
first
amendment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you...
you
think
it
erred
in
striking
down
part
1.
you...
you
would
not
be
willing
to
see
the
judgment
stand
striking
down
part
1,
but
leaving
part
2.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
shannon.
mr.
vita,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you--
--but
now,
under
the
old
statute,
is
it
your
position
that
the
acts
actually
engaged
in
by
your...
your
client
are
protected
by
the
first
amendment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
case
of
ours
do
you
think
supports
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
our
whole
law
of
homicide...
the
injury
is
the
same
in
each
case.
there's
a
death
of
a
human
being.
but
the
punishment
for
it
depends
greatly
on
what
the
state
of
mind
of
the
charged
defendant
was.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--do
you
think
if
i'm...
if
i'm
a
painter,
i
could,
contrary
to
state
law,
induce
the
minor
daughter
of
the
people
next
door
to
come
over
and
pose
for
me
and
say
that's...
even
though
the
state
law
forbids
it
and
say
that's
the
first
amendment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i'm
not
talking
about...
i'm
talking
about--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
supposing
massachusetts
enacted
a
statute
saying
that
no
one
shall
induce
a
minor
child
without
the
consent
of
the
parents
to
pose
in
various
nude
things,
just
like
massachusetts
has
said,
does
the
first
amendment
protect
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
why
should
it
make
any
difference
at
all
how
the
photograph
turns
out
if
the
evil
at
which
the
state
is
aiming
is
the
posing
of
a
minor
child
in
that
way
without
the
consent
of
the
parents?
whether
it's
an
impressionist,
a
representation
or
abstract
will
make
no
differences
to
the
injury.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
the
state
can't
generalize
from
the...
the
material
it
has,
that
it
would
have
to
show
some
sort
of
injury
in
every
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
vita.
general
shannon,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you.
whatever
prosecutions
are...
are
pending,
all
the
acts
have
taken
place
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
shannon.
the
case
is
submitted.
