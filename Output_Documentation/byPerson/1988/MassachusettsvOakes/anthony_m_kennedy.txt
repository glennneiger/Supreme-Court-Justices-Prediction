justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
phrase
the
issue
as
to
whether
not
overbreadth
invalidates
the
statute.
do
you
concede
the
statute
is
overbroad?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
statute
doesn't
say
depicts
and
it
doesn't
say
photograph.
it
says
permits
a
child
to
pose
or
be
exhibited.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that...
that's
different
than...
than
permitting
the
child
to
be
depicted.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
if
somebody
just
snaps
the
little
baby
in
the
wading
pool?
is
the
baby
posing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
again,
it
doesn't
say
visual
representation.
it's
your
statute.
if
you
want
to
say
it's
overbroad,
i
suppose
you
can.
but
it
says
to
be
exhibited.
it's
not...
it's
not--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--clear
to
me
that
a
family
snapshot
is
an
exhibit.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
look
at
the
statute
and
divide
it
into
two
parts,
the
first
part
being
whoever
permits
the
child
to
pose
or
be
exhibited
in
a
state
of
nudity,
and
then
the
next
part
is
what
the
sexual
suggestiveness
part
of
the
statute,
as
i
understand
it...
please
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
the
trial
court
instructed
the
jury
just
on
the
first
part
of
the
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
it's
only
the
so-called
or
the
allegedly
overly
broad
statute
that
was
the
basis
for
this
conviction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
not
clear
to
me
that
if
part
a
is...
is...
is
void
and
part
b
is
valid,
if
you
have
it
before
you
to
save
part
b
when
part
a
was
the
only
thing
the
jury
was
instructed
on.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
why
should
they
go
on
to
explore
part
b
if
part
a
was
the
only
thing
presented
to
the
jury?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let
me...
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way.
assuming
that
we
have
it
before
us...
i'm
not
sure
that
we
do
since
it's
a
state
court
statute.
assuming
we
would
somehow
say,
well,
the
statute
is
void
in
its
first
part
and
valid
in
the
second,
how
does
that
avail
the
state
here
when
only
the
first
part
was
the
basis
of
the
charge?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words,
the
legislative
action
that
was
taken
was
not
a
repealer
of
this
statute.
it
was
just
the
enactment
of
a
new
one,
and
this
statute
remained
on
the
books
subject
to
being
stricken
by
the
supreme
judicial
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
it
can't
come
back
no
matter
what
we
say
and
no
matter
what
the
supreme
judicial
court
says.
it's
gone.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
take
it
they
don't
have
to
prove
that,
or
do
they,
under
the
law?
if
it's
a
rational
judgment
to
be
made
by
the
state,
that
suffices.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
they
don't
have
to
prove
it
one
way
or
the
other.
if
there's
evidence
on
which
they
might
act
and
it
might
come
to
that
conclusion,
even
though
we
may
disagree,
that's
the
end
of
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
we
were
starting
out
case
by
case,
and
you
say
that
even
a
photograph
taken
with
a
lascivious
intent
is
protected.
so,
you
don't
even
get
beyond
that
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what...
what
about
the
facts
in
this
case?
could
the
legislature
by
a
properly,
narrowly
drawn
statute
punish
the
conduct
that
occurred
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
jury
has
before
it
just
the
evidence
it
has
here,
nothing
more.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
this--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--punish
the
conduct
in
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
must...
that
must
be
because
there
are
other
elements
than
pure
speech
involved.
