justice
john
paul
stevens
general
shannon,
have
you
looked
at
the
brief
filed
by
the
law
&
humanities
institute
in
support
of
respondent?
they
have
all
sorts
of
pictures
in
there
they
claim
are
great
works
of
art
and
one
thing
and
another.
do
you
think
any
of
them
are
protected
by
the
constitution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
it's
quite
clear
that
under
your
view
there's
no
requirement
of
any
lascivious
intent
then.
it's
quite
clear,
isn't
it,
because
a
lot
of
these
pictures...
there's
nothing
lascivious
about
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
it's
your...
your
position
any
picture
of
a...
any
picture
of
a
nude
person
under
the
age
of
whatever
it
is
is...
is
totally
unprotected
unless
it's
an
infant.
unless
it's
an
infant,
is
that
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
you've
told
me
none
of
these
would
qualify
under
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
presume
that
in
every
such
case,
there
is
harm
to
the
child.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
general
shannon,
but
what
that
means
i
suppose
is
that
if
you
make
a
charge
that's
much
more
serious
than
this
and
you're
not
quite
sure
you
can
prove
that
one,
you're
sure
you
can
get
them
on
the
photograph
charge--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
that
it's
sort
of
a
nice
second
weapon
to
have
in
those
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
if
you
really
have
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
all
those
other
offenses,
you
wouldn't
need
this
statute
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
this
statute
enables
you
to
avoid
the
problem
of
proving
that
kind
of
crime
by
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
again?
i'm
not...
there
seems
to
me
some
tension
between
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy
and
part
2
of
your
brief.
are
you
taking
the
position
that
the
conduct
in
this
case
is
not
constitutionally
protected?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
no
matter
what
the
statute
said,
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
say
no
matter
how
narrowly
drawn
the
statute
is
you
still
would
win
according
to
your
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
not
what
i
understood
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--this
activity,
and
your
answer
to
that
is
no,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
that's
what
i
thought.
so...
so
then
this
conduct
could
not
be
punished?
justice
john
paul
stevens
xxx
that.
what
if...
i
mean
you
can
volunteer
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
very
well.
the
case
is--
--i
have
one.
may
i
ask
just
one?
would
you
clarify,
general,
just
exactly
what
is
the
status
of
the
new
statute?
did
it
repeal
the
earlier
statute,
amend
it?
exactly
what
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
if
we
were
to
reverse,
as
you
ask
us
to,
that
would
revive
some
prosecutions
or
potential--
