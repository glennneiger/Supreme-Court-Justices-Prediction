mr.
james
m.
shannon
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
to
the
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts.
and
it
raises
the
question
as
to
whether
the
overbreadth
of
a
massachusetts
statute
whose
purpose
is
to
prevent
the
sexual
exploitation
and
abuse
of
children
is
so
real
and
so
substantial
as
to
warrant
striking
down
the
whole
statute
on
its
face.
the
relevant
statute,
chapter
272,
section
29a,
punishes
whoever
hires,
entices,
employs,
procures,
uses,
causes,
encourages
or
knowingly
permits
a
child
under
the
age
of
18
to
pose
or
be
exhibited
in
a
state
of
nudity
or
to
participate
in
sexual
conduct
for
the
purpose
of
any
visual
representation.
mr.
james
m.
shannon
it...
it
is
our
position,
your
honor,
that
although
the
court
below
specifically
did
not
react
the
question
as
to
whether
the
respondent's
activity
was
protected
or
not...
it
is
position
that
it
was
clearly
not
protected.
mr.
james
m.
shannon
it--
mr.
james
m.
shannon
--that's
right,
your
honor.
it
would...
would
forbid
it.
mr.
james
m.
shannon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
shannon
it
has,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
shannon
there
is
a
requirement
now
of
lascivious
intent
which
didn't
exist
prior
to
the
supreme
judicial
court's
decision.
mr.
james
m.
shannon
i
think
that
the
defendant
in
this
case,
your
honor,
could
have
been
prosecuted
under
the
nude
statute...
the
new
statute
because
the
definition
of
lascivious
intent
in
that
statute
includes
inappropriate
attire
and...
and
suggestive
poses.
and
i
think
he
could
have
been--
mr.
james
m.
shannon
--prosecuted.
mr.
james
m.
shannon
i
believe,
your
honor,
there
are
two
states
that
have
statutes
which
would
prohibit
depicting
children
in
the
state
of
nudity.
kansas
is
one,
and
ohio
is
the
other.
although
the
wordings
of
the
statutes
are...
are
a
little
bit
different
from
massachusetts,
they
specifically
speak
about
nudity,
depicting
a
child
in
a
state
of
nudity
being
a
prosecutable
offense.
mr.
james
m.
shannon
that
is...
that
is
my
understanding,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
shannon
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
shannon
yes,
your
honor,
we
do
concede
that
there
is
overbreadth.
as
the
court
below
said,
read
literally,
the
statute
would
reach
benign
family
activity.
the
one
example
that
they
used
is
the...
the
activity
of
a
parent
depicting
a
child...
photographing
a
child,
a
toddler,
one-year
old
toddler
romping
on
the
beach
without
a
bathing
suit
on.
mr.
james
m.
shannon
for
purposes
of
visual
representation.
mr.
james
m.
shannon
your
honor,
the
statute
does
prohibit
posing
or
permitting
a
child
to
pose.
there's
no
question
about
that.
and
it
is
our
belief
that
in
citing
that--
mr.
james
m.
shannon
--well,
the
parent
might
be
permitting
the
baby
to
pose
or
be
used
for
visual
representation,
and
that
is
the
basis
for
the
supreme
judicial
court's--
mr.
james
m.
shannon
--well--
mr.
james
m.
shannon
--your
honor,
is
raising
i
think
a
very
important
question
here
and
that
is
whether...
whether
even
that
which
has
been
suggested
by
the
supreme
judicial
court
as
being
technically
or
literally
in
violation
of
the
statute
would
be
because
prosecutors
in
massachusetts
have
certainly
never
read
this
statute
and
the
words
of
this
statute
as
to
involve
that
kind
of
activity.
mr.
james
m.
shannon
your
honor,
what
we
have
here
i
believe
is
not
the
construal
of
the
statute
really
as
much
as
it
is
a
literal
reading
of
the
statute--
mr.
james
m.
shannon
--i
think
that
what
the
court
did
below
was
exactly
what
this
court
has
said
it
shouldn't
do.
it
took
one...
one
conceivable
violation,
one
conceivable
infringement
on
constitutionally
protected
activity,
and
constituted
that
as
substantial
overbreadth.
mr.
james
m.
shannon
we
are
asking...
we...
we
believe
that
this
court
should
accept
the
statute
as
it
has
been
interpreted
by
the
court,
but
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
the
overbreadth
that
the
court
below
spoke
of
is
substantial
and
real--
mr.
james
m.
shannon
--your
honor,
i
think
that
there
is
a
very
substantial
argument
that
could
be
made
that
none
of
the
conduct
that
is
implicated
by
this
statute
is
protected
by
the
constitution.
on
the
margins,
perhaps
there
are
some...
some...
some
entwinement
with
constitutionally
protected
activity.
now,
in
the
case
of
a
benign
family
photo,
it
is
arguable
i
suppose
that
that
kind
of
activity
is
protected
by
a
right
to
privacy.
in
some
other
cases,
perhaps
taking
pictures
of
children
in
a
state
of
nudity
might
be
protected
by
some
associational
rights.
but
even
conceding
that
this
statute
implicates
protected
conduct,
we
believe
that
this...
it
does
not
implicate
conduct
to
the
degree
that
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
anything
like
real
and
substantial
overbreadth.
mr.
james
m.
shannon
that's
correct.
mr.
james
m.
shannon
that's
correct.
if
we
were
talking
about
some
associational
rights,
there
might
be
some
possible
overbreadth
analysis.
but
even
if
we
were
to
concede
that
this
implicates
the
first
amendment
on
the
margin
in
some
way,
which
we
are
willing
to
concede
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument,
i
feel
very
comfortable
in
saying
that
any
overbreadth
here
is
not
real
and
not
substantial,
that
any
possible
infringements
on
constitutionally
protected
activity
are
best
resolved
to
the
case-by-case
analysis
that
was
suggested
in
the
ferber...
in
the
ferber
case.
and
that...
and
that
is
what
our
argument
is,
your
honor,
because
the
court
below
did
not
go
further
than
to
think
of
this
one
conceivable
impermissible
application
of
the
statute,
the...
the
child
on
the
beach
or
the
child
in
the
wading
pool.
it
then
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
that
one
conceivable
misapplication
of
the
statute
constituted
real
and
substantial
overbreadth,
and
we
think
in
so
doing--
mr.
james
m.
shannon
--i...
i
do
not,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
could
prohibit
constitutionally
the
taking
of
those
pictures
in...
in
massachusetts.
and
the
reason
is
that
the...
those
pictures,
those
very
sorts
of
pictures
that
are
contained
in
that
brief,
have
been
shown
to
do
harm
to
the
children
who
are
used
as
models.
our
legislature
made
that
determination,
to
be
sure,
back
in
1977
and
again
when
the
statute
was
reenacted
in
1982,
and
tried
to
deal
with
it--
mr.
james
m.
shannon
--that's...
that's
rights.
there
should
be
no
requirement
of
lascivious
intent
in
my--
mr.
james
m.
shannon
--i
would...
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
is
an
affirmative
defense
in
the
statute
that
tracks
the
language
of
ferber
for...
for
works
of
art
that
are
produced
for...
for
a
bona
fide
museum
or...
or
school.
mr.
james
m.
shannon
well,
your
honor,
i...
believe
that
the
question
of
whether
the
product
of
the
posing
ends
up
being
a
legitimate
work
of
art
is
wholly
irrelevant
to
the
consideration
of
whether
making
that
particular
photograph
or
painting
did
harm
to
the
children
who
were
involved.
and
that
is
the
concern
that
the
commonwealth
has
in
this
statutes.
mr.
james
m.
shannon
that
is
a
presumption,
your
honor,
that
the
legislature
has
made,
and
i
think...
i
think
that
they
had
a
very
rational
basis
for
making
that
presumption
because,
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief--
mr.
james
m.
shannon
--the...
the
rational
basis,
your
honor,
is...
has
i
think
been
substantiated
by
study
after
study
that
shows
that
the
use
of
children
in
nude
photography
does
do
harm
to
them,
does
cause
them
guilt
and
shame
and
fear--
mr.
james
m.
shannon
--this
is
a
case--
mr.
james
m.
shannon
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
shannon
your
honor,
i...
i
would
refer
your
honor
to
the
riceman
report
which
is
contained
in
the
briefs
of
amici
and
to
the
numerous--
mr.
james
m.
shannon
--yes,
your
honor.
i...
i
think
that
study
after
study
has
shown
that
taking
pictures
of
children
in
a
state
of
nudity--
mr.
james
m.
shannon
--one
child,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
shannon
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the...
that
it's
clear
that
the
reports,
the
studies,
that
have
been
done
both
before
ferber
and
since
ferber
show
that...
that
posing
children
in
that
state
does
do
them...
posing
a
child
in
that
state
of
nudity
does--
mr.
james
m.
shannon
--i...
i
can
refer
your
honor
to
the...
to
the
riceman
report.
mr.
james
m.
shannon
that
any
posing
of
a
child
in
a
state
of
nudity,
your
honor,
can
and
does
in
many
cases
do
harm
to
that
child,
that
the
child
will
experience
shame,
fear
of
blackmail,
guilt,
that
pedophiles
that
typically
take
pictures
of
children
as
a
way
of
lowering
their
inhibitions
so
that
they
can
use
them
for
their
own
sexual
gratification.
mr.
james
m.
shannon
if
the
child
later
became
aware
that
a
picture
had
been
taken.
one
of
the
cases
in--
mr.
james
m.
shannon
--if
the
child
didn't
know
that
a
picture
had
been
taken,
i
suppose
the
child
would
not...
would
not
be
injured.
mr.
james
m.
shannon
the
child
might
not
be
injured
automatically,
but
the
child
would
be
injured
if
that
picture
were
then
used
for...
shown
to
somebody
else
or
if
that
picture
were
then
kept
by
the
person
who
took
the
picture--
mr.
james
m.
shannon
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
shannon
yes,
your
honor,
and...
and
this
statute--
mr.
james
m.
shannon
--this
statute
is
not
aimed
at
that--
mr.
james
m.
shannon
--they
are...
they
are
not
injured,
your
honor.
but
this...
this
statute
is--
mr.
james
m.
shannon
--as
a
literal
reading
of
the
statute
would
cover
those
children,
but
this
statute
has
never
been
used
for
that
purpose.
it
was
never
aimed
at
that
purpose.
it
was
never
in
the
thinking
of
the
legislature,
nor
has
it
been
in
the
thinking
of
any
prosecutors
that
it
would
be
used
for
that
purpose.
when
i
go
around
my
office
in
boston,
many,
many
of
my
assistants
who
are
well
aware
of
the
existence
of
this
statute,
have
those
bear
skin
rug
type
pictures
of
their
infants
on
their
desks.
they
don't
have
any
fear
that
they're
going
to
be
prosecuted,
nor
does
anybody
else
have
any
fear
that
they're
going
to
be
prosecuted
because
every
person,
as
the
court
below,
would
view
those
pictures
as
being
lawful.
the
question
here
is
does
the
state
have
the
ability
to
try
to
get
at
activity
which
has
been
shown
and
demonstrated
in
case
after
case
to
be
harmful
to
children.
and
that's
what
this
statute
is...
is
all
about
and
that
is
the
way
in
which
it
has
been
used.
the
record
of
enforcement
in
massachusetts
shows
very
clearly
that...
i
should
point
out
that
in...
in
making
the
claim
of
overbreadth,
respondent
has
not
produced
one
case
where
this
statute
has
ever
been
applied
to
anything
that
closely
approaches
a
constitutionally
protected
activity.
we
have
produced,
however,
in
our...
the
appendix
to
our
brief
a
listing
of
every
prosecution
that
has
been
brought
under
the
statute
since
1977,
29
prosecutions.
and
in
26
of
those
cases,
the
charges
for
violation
of
this
statute
were
accompanied
by
charges
for
either
statutory
rape
or
indecent
assault
and
battery--
mr.
james
m.
shannon
--in
some
cases--
mr.
james
m.
shannon
--that's
right,
your
honor.
in
some
cases
that
is
true.
but
i
would
not
minimize
the
harm
that
is
done
to
a
child,
even
a
child--
mr.
james
m.
shannon
--it
is...
it
is
well-known,
your
honor,
that
proving
cases
of
statutory
rape,
a
rape
on
a
child
or
sexual
abuse
on
a
child,
is
very
difficult
because
oftentimes,
as
in
this
very
case--
mr.
james
m.
shannon
--we
have
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
a
child
was
posed
or
photographed
in
a
state
of
nudity.
and...
and
even
in
cases,
your
honor,
where
there
has
been
some
other
form
of
sexual
abuse,
this
is
an
important
charge
because
it
has
been
shown
that
this
kind
of
activity
does
a
separate
harm
to
children.
children
are
afraid
that
the
existence
of
these
photographs
or
pictures
can
later
come
back
to
haunt
them
or
to
blackmail
them,
and
it
causes
a
continuing
harm
of
depression
and
shame
and
guilt
and
all
of
the
things
that
are
referred
to
in
the
briefs.
so,
this
is
a...
an
important
statute
standing
on
its
own,
and
it's
an
important
statute
when
it
is
used
along
with
other
charges
to
prevent
the
sexual
exploitation
and
abuse
of
children.
and
that
is
the
only
purpose
for
which
this
statute
has...
has
ever
been
used.
mr.
james
m.
shannon
i
hope
that
it
is,
your
honor,
but
i
am
not
sure,
to
be...
to
be
very
honest
because
it
has--
mr.
james
m.
shannon
--we...
we
passed
this
statute,
your
honor,
because
of
the
importance
that
we
placed
on
having
a
tool
to
prevent
this
kind
of
activity
while
this
court
was
considering
this...
this
very
case.
and
we
certainly
hope
that
it's
going
to
meet
the
needs
that
we
have
found.
but
i
would
also
point
out
to
your
honor
that
in
the
briefs
that
have
been
filed
on
the
other
side
in
support
of
the
respondent's
position,
they
have
raised
questions
about
whether
this
statute
can
be
subject
to
the
same
kind
of
attack.
and
the
reason
that
they
have
done
that
and
the
importance
of
this
court's
deciding
this
case
is
that
after
the
ferber
decision,
it
was
pretty
clear
to
states
that
they
could
take
action
to
prevent
the
production
of
materials
using
children
as
models
if
those
materials
showed
children
engaged
in
sexual
conduct.
but
it
left
hanging
the
question
of
what
about
nudity?
what
about
other
types
of
activity
which
has
been
show
to
cause
harm
to
children?
mr.
james
m.
shannon
it
did,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
where
it
said
that
it
was
referring
to
the
erzoznick
opinion,
but
it
wasn't
talking
i
don't
believe,
your
honor,
about
nudity
among
children.
just
as
in
ferber
the
court
said
that
sexual
conduct
that
didn't
meet
the
obscenity
standards
of
the
court
could
be
prohibited
by
the
state,
we
believe
that
the
court
should
now
take
the
next
step
and
deal
with
this
other
body
of
material
which
has
been
shown
to
do
harm
to
children,
which
the
state
has,
i
would
suggest,
not
just
a
legitimate
interest,
but
a
compelling,
surpassing
interest
in...
in
prohibiting,
that
we
should
be
sanctioned
in
our
efforts
to
do
just
that.
the
same
rationale
of
ferber
applies
to
this...
this
fact
situation.
mr.
james
m.
shannon
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
my
understanding.
they
used
the...
the...
they
used
the
words
of
the
statute...
i
can't
recall
at
the
moment.
i
guess
they
just
did
use
the
first
part
of
the
statute.
mr.
james
m.
shannon
that
is
right.
there
was
no
evidence
introduced
at
the
trial
that
there
had
been
any
sexual...
overtly
sexual
conduct
or
that
the
second
part
of
the
statute
was
implicated
at
all.
these
were
photographs
which
were
taken...
evidence
was
introduced
at
the
trial
that
the
photographs
were
taken
by
the
respondent
of
his
14-year
old
stepdaughter
topless
wearing
just
a
pair
of
briefs
and
a
red
scarf
on
top
of
the
bar
in
the
family
home
when
they
were
there
alone.
and
the
words
of
the
statute,
the
first
part
of
the
statute,
were
used
as
the
charge
to...
to
the
jury.
so,
i
would
also
point
out,
though,
that
the...
that
the
decision
of
the
supreme
judicial
court,
of
course,
affects
the
whole
statute,
including
that
part
which
goes
exactly
at
the
ferber...
goes
at
the
ferber
situation.
what
the
court
should
do
is
consider
the
plainly
legitimate
sweep
of
the
statute,
consider
whether
there
is
a...
a
criminally...
constitutionally
regulable
core
of
activity
here...
and
i
would
submit
that
it
is
clear
that
there
is...
and
then
determine
whether
any
overbreadth
in
the
statute
is
real
and
substantial
and
so
real
and
substantial
as
to
necessitate
the
court's
striking
down
the
whole--
mr.
james
m.
shannon
--there
is,
your
honor.
there's
a
severability--
mr.
james
m.
shannon
--your
honor,
the
court
didn't
answer
that
question,
and
it
is
a
baffling
question.
the
dissents
referred
to
the
severability
clause
and
said
if
there's
a
problem,
we
can
sever
those
constitutionally
protected
parts
of
the
statute
from
those
which
aren't.
or
the
court
could
have
put
a
limiting
construction
on...
on
the
statute
if
it
had
wanted
to
do
so.
and
that
is
why
i
believe
what
the
court
below
did
was
clearly
unnecessarily
striking
down
this
statute
using
the
federal
constitution
to
do
it.
mr.
james
m.
shannon
i'm...
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts--
mr.
james
m.
shannon
--their
decision
clearly
affects
both
part
a
and
part
b.
what
they
did
in
this...
in
this
decision
was
they
struck
down
the
whole
statute,
29a,
which
include
both
depicting
children...
picturing
children
in
the
state
of
nudity
and...
and
picturing
children
engaged
in
sexual
conduct.
so,
they...
they
struck
down
the
whole
statute,
including
that
part
which
has
already
i
believe
been
clearly
sanctioned
by...
by
ferber.
and
so,
the
question
arises
how
could
they--
mr.
james
m.
shannon
--it
doesn't.
it
doesn't,
your
honor.
and
that
would
leave
a
whole
body
of
activity
that
has
been
shown
to
harm
children
which
the
state
would
be
powerless
to
prohibit.
and
that
is...
and
that
is
our
concern.
and
that
is
the
nub
of
our...
of
our
case.
mr.
james
m.
shannon
your
honor,
i...
i
believe
that
the
statute...
that
the
case
should
be
decided
on...
on
overbreadth
grounds
because
there
are
so
many
questions
as
to
how
what
our
highest
state
court
did
below
affects
the
new
statute
and
how
it
might
affect
other
statutes.
mr.
james
m.
shannon
well,
the--
mr.
james
m.
shannon
--well,
the
court...
your
honor
is
absolutely
correct
in
suggesting
that
this
statute
can
no
longer
inhibit
speech,
and...
and
so,
the
court
could
do
that.
but
i
think
that
the
question
still
remains--
mr.
james
m.
shannon
--we
have
a
new
statute,
and
we...
we
are
stuck
with
it.
we
don't
know
how
well
it's
going
to...
how
well
it's
going
to
work.
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
we
have
other
prosecutions
that
we're
concerned
about
which
might
have
to
be
prosecuted
under
the
old
statute,
and
we
have
a
core
of
activity
that
took
place
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
new
statute
which
we
can't
do
anything
about
right
now.
i've
already
had
inquiries
from
district
attorney's
offices
about...
about
taking
a
picture,
similar
situations
to
the
one
in
this
case,
that
took
place
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
new
statute,
and
they're
asking
me
what
can...
what
can
we
do.
and
the
answer
is
right
now
i'm
not
sure
what
we
can...
what
we
can
do.
so,
those
i
think
are
also
good
reasons
why
the
court
should
decide
this
case.
but
the
principal
reason
is
that
the
court
below
i
think
clearly
made
error
when
it
struck
down
the
whole
statute
as
being
substantially
overbroad
and
because
this
is
a
question
i
think
of
surpassing
interests
not
only
to
massachusetts
but
to
other
states
as
well.
mr.
james
m.
shannon
no,
i
would
not,
your
honor.
i
think
part...
the
first
part
of
the
statute,
the
part
dealing
with
nudity
is
very...
is
a
very
important
tool,
a
necessary
tool
if
we
are
to
adequately
protect
children.
this,
as
this
court
well
knows,
is
an
issue
that
the
states
have
been
trying
to
deal
with
with
some
difficulty
now
for
the
last
decade
or
more.
i
don't
think
we've
heard
the
final
word
of
it
from
legislatures.
and
i
certainly
do
hope
that
the
new
statute
is
going
to
be
effective
in
preventing
the
activity
that
we're
trying
to
reach
here.
but
as
i
suggested,
it
has
already
been
suggested
to
us
that
it's
going
to
be
challenged
on
the
same
overbreadth...
overbreadth
grounds,
and
i
think
that
the
state
has
such
a
compelling
interest
in
this
area
that
we
should
be
given
some
latitude
in
how...
in
trying
to
reach
this
activity
which
has
been
so
clearly
and
convincingly
shown
to
cause
grave
and
serious
and
lasting
harm
to
children.
i
can
think
of
no
obligation
of
the
state
more
important
than
the
state's
obligation
to
take
action
to
prevent
the
children
who
live
in
the
state
from
harm.
section
29a
is
an
important
part
of
our
efforts
in
massachusetts
to
do
that.
and
i
would
ask
the
court
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
supreme
judicial...
judicial
court.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions
now,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
james
m.
shannon
your
honor,
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
i
have
nothing
further
to
add.
mr.
james
m.
shannon
it...
the
old
statute
can
be
used,
your
honor,
to
prosecute
those
activities
which
took
place
prior
to
the
enactment
date
of
the...
of
the...
of
the
new
statute.
mr.
james
m.
shannon
yes,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
shannon
any...
any
acts
that
would
be
prosecuted
under
the
old
statute
have
already...
have
already
taken
place.
mr.
james
m.
shannon
the...
the
old
statute,
of
course,
your
honor,
did
not
have
a
lascivious
intent
requirement
which--
mr.
james
m.
shannon
--except
for
purposes
of
prosecution.
mr.
james
m.
shannon
yes.
mr.
james
m.
shannon
the
old
statute
will
have
no
chilling
effect
on
future
conduct.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
shannon
it
was...
it
was
reenacted.
i
think...
my...
my
understanding
of
it
is
there
is
a
new
statute
on
the
books
which
supplants
the
old
statute.
the
old
statute
applies
only
to...
only
to
activity
that
took
place
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
new
statute.
so,
the
new
statute
will
not...
not
be
used
without
further...
the
old
statute
will
not
be
used
without
further
action
by
the
legislature
to
revive
it,
your
honor.
thank
you.
