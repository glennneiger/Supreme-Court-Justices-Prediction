justice
sandra
day
o'connor
xxx--
--general
shannon,
the
statute
has
been
amended
in
massachusetts
since
we
took
the
case,
has
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
to
add
a
lasciviousness
requirement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
gather,
would
you
think
that
the
defendant
in
this
case
would
have
been
subject
to
prosecution
and
he
could
be
found
guilty
under
the
new
statute
as
amended?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
any
other
state
that
has
a
statute
as
broad
as
the
one
at
issue
in
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
ohio
supreme
court
has...
has
narrowed
the
interpretation
of
its
statute,
has
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
think
kansas
is
equivalent
to
massachusetts?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
don't
we
have
to
accept
the
broad
interpretation
given
it
by
the
massachusetts
supreme
court,
and
didn't
we
say
in
ferber
that
we
would
accept
the
interpretation
of
the
state
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
court
read
it
literally
and
said
it
would...
it
would
be
violated
by
taking
a
picture
of
a
nude
toddler.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
are
you
asking
us
to
reinterpret
the
statute,
or
are
you
willing
to
have
us
accept
it
as
it's
broadly
read
by
the
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
shannon,
do
you
think
that
the
new
statute
that
directs
itself
to
the
posing
with
lascivious
intent
is
adequate
to
protect
the
state's
interests
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
certainly
seems
to
be
the
way
most
states
have
gone.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
ferber...
the
opinion
in
ferber
said
nudity
without
more
is
protected
expression,
did
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
a
severability
clause
for
this
statute
that's
applicable
to
it,
general
shannon?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
did
the
court
not
refer
to
the
severability
clause
and
sever
out
any
possibly
valid
portion,
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what's
the
purpose
of
the
overbreadth?
is
it
to
avoid
chilling
legitimate
first
amendment
conduct
by
others?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
the
purpose
of
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
that
statute
isn't
on
the
books
anymore,
as
justice
scalia
has
suggested,
why
should
we
hold
it...
hold
anything
invalid
under
overbreadth
analysis?
that
statute
is
gone.
how
could
it
inhibit
anybody
now?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we
don't
have
the
new
one
in
front
of
us.
we
only
have
the
old
one,
and
it
doesn't
exist
anymore.
it
has
been
replaced.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
that
isn't
my
question.
the
massachusetts
court
found
it
overly
broad
and
struck
it.
we're
reviewing
that
decision.
in
the
meantime,
the
legislature
has
replaced
the
statute,
has
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
i'm
asking
what
is
there
of
the
original
statute
to
which
an
overbreadth
analysis
would
now
apply?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
counsel,
would
you
concede
that
lascivious
depictions
of
child
nudity
can
be
prohibited
by
the
state?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
why
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there's
not
much
doubt,
is
there,
that
photographs
of
the
type
taken
here
of
a
post-pubertal
child
in
this
condition
could
be
very
harmful
to
that
child?
do
you
dispute
that?
