mr.
richard
j.
vita
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
appears
at
least
in
argument
that
my
brother
has
conceded
several
points
that
appear
to
have
been
in
contention
in
the
briefing
by
the
attorney
general's
office.
but
we
can
accept
his
position
with
regard
to
the
fact
that
the
massachusetts
statute
in
question
in
this
case
is
overbroad
and...
and
also
that
the
activity
in
taking
the
photograph
involves
first
amendment
rights.
and
starting
then
from...
from
that
point,
i
move
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
facial
overbreadth
in
that
analysis
is
appropriate
in
this
case.
and
the
standard,
however
strict,
that
the
court
has
noted
that
its
application
is
strong
medicine
and
that
it
should
be
used
with
great
caution--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--yes.
mr.
richard
j.
vita
i
believe
that
that
is
one
of
the
central
purposes--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--the
original
statute--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--under
which
mr.
oakes--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--were
this
court
to
determine
that
the
new
statute
with
the
lascivious
intent
requirement
is
an
appropriate
area
of
regulation--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--well,
obviously,
most
respectfully,
were
the
court
to
uphold
the
decision
of
the
massachusetts
supreme
court
striking
down
the
statute
on
reasons
of
overbreadth,
then
the...
the
chilling
effect
upon
the
citizens
of
the
commonwealth
would
not
exist
because
there
would
be...
the
remainder
would
be
the
clear
statement
of
the--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--yes,
it
has.
mr.
richard
j.
vita
well,
it
would
seem
that
during
the...
the
pendency
of
this
appeal
to
the
court,
that
citizens
might
be
in
a
quandary
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
activities
that
they
would
choose
to
engage
in
are
nonetheless
going
to
be
the
subject
of
a
potential
prosecution.
i
think
the
chilling
effect
during
the
pendency--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--yes,
it
would
be
unless
this
court
reversed.
mr.
richard
j.
vita
well,
i
submit--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--well,
i
would
submit
that
the...
the--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--that's--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--that
is
correct.
and
i...
i
also
think--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--i
believe
that
it
was
a
repealer
of
the
statute.
mr.
richard
j.
vita
that
is
correct.
and
i
think
then
the
issue
would
relate
to
the
new
statute
as
to
whether
or
not
lascivious
intent
on
the
part
of
the
person
that
would
take
a
photograph
is--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
vita
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
vita
well,
your
honor,
i
would
point
to...
point
to
the
ferber
decision
in
which
this
court...
this
court
stated
on
page
774,
"nor
will
we
assume
that
the
new
york
courts
will
widen
the
possibly
invalid
reach
of
the
statute
by
giving
an
expansive
construction
to
the
proscription
on
lewd
exhibition
of
the
genitals.
"
the
term
"lewd
exhibition
of
the
genitals"
was
part
of
a
definition
of
sexual
conduct
under
the
new
york
statute,
and
it
would
appear
from
that
language
that
the
court
was...
was
not
willing
to
make
an
assumption
that...
that
the
state
of
new
york
would
widen
the
definition
of
sexual
conduct
to
go
beyond
the
lewd
exhibition
of
the
genitals.
mr.
richard
j.
vita
it
is--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--well,
the
issue
was
raised
before
the
supreme
judicial
court
not
on
a
claim
under
the
state
constitution
whether
or
not
this
statute
which
prohibits
the
posing
or
depiction
in
a
state
of
nudity
or
semi-nudity.
the
issue
that
was
addressed
by
the
court
was
what...
a
federal
constitutional
question
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
richard
j.
vita
i
would
not,
and
i...
essentially
the--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--the...
the
aims
that
have
been
stated
for
the
banning
of
this
type
of
activity
have
been
directed
towards
conduct
that
will
likely
result
in
injury
or
harm
to
the
child.
one
can--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--well,
i
do
dispute
that,
but
if
i
could
just
finish
the
answer
to
the
lascivious
intent.
upon
analysis,
it
would
matter
little
to
the
child
in
question
whether
or
not
the
person
who
had
taken
the
photograph...
the
intent
of
the
person
in
doing
so...
if...
if
there
was
to
be
injury
to
the
child
and
whether
or
not
that
would
occur
in
a
given
case
is
certainly
not
answered
by
a
provision
which
requires
that
the
photographer
have
this
so-called
lascivious
intent.
so--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--the...
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
i
submit,
in
its
brief
and
in
its
argument
has
failed
to
articulate
a
convincing,
empirical,
scientific
or
psychological
demonstration
that
proves
the
rational
basis
that
nudity
or
semi-nudity
does,
in
fact,
result
in...
in
serious
harm
to
the
child.
most
of
the...
virtually
all
of
the
authorities
in
the
arguments
presented
deal
with
the
issue
of
pornographic
materials.
mr.
richard
j.
vita
well,
i...
i
submit
that
the--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--most
respectfully,
your
honor,
i...
i
believe
that
the
court
is
entitled
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
aims
targeted
by
the
statute
are
fairly
restricted
by
the
type
of
conduct
that
is
prohibited
under
the
statute.
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--that
is
correct.
i...
i
believe
that...
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
have
on
several
occasions
held
that
nudity
without
more
may
not
be
properly
limited,
that...
that
those
decisions
of
the
court
carve
out
an
area
of
protected
activity,
and
that
it's
only,
the
respondent
argues,
where
sexual
conduct,
as
that
has
been
defined
in
the
legislature
in
accordance
with
the
decisions
and
pronouncements
set
down
by
this
court,
may
be
properly
limited.
mr.
richard
j.
vita
i
cannot--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--well,
i...
i
don't...
i
cannot
say
that
there's
any
statute
that
has
been
enacted
that
would
fall
within
the
example
that
you
have
cited.
but
i
would
think--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--well,
it
might
depend
on
the
circumstance.
i
can
think
of
examples
where...
where
it...
it
might
clearly
fall
within
protected
activity.
i
can
perhaps
mention
to
the
court
at
some--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--well,
i...
i
submit
that
the
analysis
that
we
have
argued
that
the...
the
process
of
photography
involves
expression.
in
some
cases
it's
more
marginal
than
in
others,
but
nonetheless--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--no,
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
j.
vita
well,
there
are
many
other
examples
of
the
type
of
conduct
that
would
be
restricted
and
this
statute
would
prohibit
beyond
the...
the
one
that
was
so
plainly
cited
by
the
massachusetts
supreme
court,
beyond
the
toddler
who
is
romping
nude
on
the
beach.
there
could
be
pictures
taken
for
the
purpose
of...
of
demonstration
or
discussion
in
a
forum
precisely
on
the
subject
of
whether
or
not
given
photographs
fall
within
the
area
of
child
exploitation
or
child
pornography.
there
also
could
be
a
potential
claim
involving
artists,
painters
or
sculptors
whose
works
frequently
do
not
become
involved
in
museum
or
libraries
until
sometimes
after
their
death--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--far
after
the
time
of
the
taking
of
the
photograph.
mr.
richard
j.
vita
well,
think
that
when
the
issue
is
framed
in
terms
of
manipulation,
coercion--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--and
those
types
of
activities,
were
a
statute
to
be
properly
limited
and
the
type
of
nudity
were...
were
described
in
a
manner
that
would...
would
satisfy
the
court's
concern
about
areas
that...
that
would
be
clearly
protected--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--in
that
particular
case,
it...
it...
it
may
not
protect
it
depending
on
the...
the
type...
the
type
of...
of
portrayal.
mr.
richard
j.
vita
the
content
of
the
photograph.
mr.
richard
j.
vita
well,
in
some
given
circumstances,
there
may
be
some
minor
children
who,
without
the
consent
of
their
parents,
that
would
have
permitted
themselves
to
be
photographed
that
may
not
result
in
injury.
it
may
depend
on...
on--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--well,
i
believe
that
if
the...
the
state
would
have
to
show
that
the
banning
of
mere
nudity
alone
by
the
very
act
of
permitting
someone
to
pose
in
nudity
is,
in
fact,
harmful
to
the
child.
can
we
say
that
those,
however
in
the
minority
they
might
be,
that
choose
the
nudist
lifestyle...
can
we
say
that
in
all
circumstances
that...
that
a
photograph
of
such
a
child
who
enjoys
the...
the...
and
chooses
in
a
family
way
the
benefit
of...
of
that
type
of...
of
expression...
can
we
say
and
be
sure
that
it's
harmful
to
the
child?
mr.
richard
j.
vita
well,
you...
you...
you
could
make
that
analogy
to
a
statutory
rape
type
of
case.
but
i
submit
that
this
area
of
protecting
the
subject
matter
of
nudity
has
long
been
safeguarded
by
this
court.
and
even
though
it's
a...
an
issue
that
generally
is
one
that
is
unpopular,
is
perhaps
not
exercised
by
a
great
many
americans,
it
nonetheless
will
still
require
this...
this
court
to
be
careful
not
to
infringe
upon
the
rights
of...
of
those
who
may
legitimately
have
their
conduct
chilled
or
be
encompassed
within
such
a
draconian
statute.
i
point
out
to
the
court
for
purposes
of
the
issue
of
whether
it's
substantial
that
the
statute
is
punishable
by
not
less
than
ten
nor
more
than
20
years
or
fines
or
both.
this
court
in
ferber
has...
has
indicated
that
the--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--i
do
not
admit
that
in...
in--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--well--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--the
photographs
that...
and
the
studies
that
have
been
cited
and
the
reports
referred
to
almost
exclusively
deal
with
the
subject
matter
of
using
child
models
in
pornographic
pictures.
and
this
court
has...
has
stated
in
ferber
that
it
would
require
at
least
a
lewd
exhibition
of
the
genitals
by
way
of
one
example
of
what
is
pornographic.
there
are
also
references
in
their
reports
with
regard
to
harm
that
deal
with
the
miller
test
or
obscenity
issues.
however,
this
court,
i
submit,
cannot
feel
comfortable
in
banning
a...
an
area
of
expression
that
is
much
a
part
of
our
culture
and
has
been
over
the
years
clearly
protected.
mr.
richard
j.
vita
i
do
see
a
difference.
mr.
richard
j.
vita
and
i
can...
i
can...
i
believe
that
a
statute
can
be
drawn
that
could
meet
the
legitimate
aims
of
the
state
to
avoid
the...
the
issue
of
child
exploitation
in
the
example
that
you're
talking
about
where--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--the
language
of
the
statute--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--well,
as...
as--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--applied
to
this
case,
if
the...
if
the
statute--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--i
believe
that
the
statute
as
applied
in...
in
this
particular
case
under
ferber
is...
is
unconstitutional
and
that
is
because
the...
the...
the
conduct
that
is
depicted
in
the
photographs
in
this
case
involve
the
exposure
of
a...
of
a
young
woman's
breasts
and
that
there--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--not
mr.--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--justice
scalia,
it...
my
point
is...
is
that
a
statute
could
be
carefully
crafted
that
would
be
limited
to
circumstances
where
the
child
is
coerced,
is...
is
otherwise
compelled
to
submit
against
her
will,
poses
that
are
in
a
sexually
exploitive
portrayal,
that
the
court
would
define
is--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--within
the
legitimate
sweep
of--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--in
the
example
that
you
have
cited
where
the...
the
child
is...
is
saying
no
and
is
being
compelled
by
the
parent,
of
course,
that's
not
an
issue
in
the
facts
of
our
case.
mr.
richard
j.
vita
xxx.
mr.
richard
j.
vita
in--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--with
a
different
statute
carefully
drawn?
mr.
richard
j.
vita
i
believe
if
there
was
a
carefully
drawn
statute,
that
it
could.
mr.
richard
j.
vita
no,
i
believe
that...
most
respectfully,
that
this
court
could
define
a
core
of
conduct
in
which
it
could
delineate
sexually
explicit
actions
by
the...
the
young
woman
which
would
take
it
out
of
the
area
of...
of
protected
speech.
it
could
define
that
the
nudity
in
the
statute--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--must
be
of
a
type
that
it
would
create
the
kind
of
harm
that
the
purpose
of
the
child
pornography
statute--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--no,
i'm
not,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
vita
i
thought
the
question
was--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
vita
i
took
it
as
a
hypothetical
question,
could
any
statute
be
fashioned
that
could
proscribe
the
kind
of
activity.
mr.
richard
j.
vita
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
vita
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
vita
well,
your
honor,
there's
no...
there's
no
authority,
a
court
decision
of
this
court
or
other
authorities
that...
that
would
squarely
address
the
issue.
and
i
might
say
that
this
particular
statute
is
virtually
unique
among...
among
states.
i
might
point
out
that--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--well,
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
vita
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
vita
yes,
it
cannot
be...
it
cannot
be...
a
state
cannot
proscribe
that
type
of
conduct.
mr.
richard
j.
vita
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
vita
well,
i
think
that
once
you're
getting
beyond
the
parents,
it
would
depend
upon
whether
or
not
there
was--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--well--
mr.
richard
j.
vita
--much
of
the
petitioner's
argument
is
directed
towards
instances
where
the
child
has
been
manipulated,
coerced,
forced
or
compelled
to
submit
to
the...
to
the
degrading
photographs.
i
submit
that
in
the
absence
of
any
evidence
that
would
show
that
that
is
occurring
within
the
ambit
of
the
statute
is...
is
protected.
for
all
of
those
reasons,
the
respondent
asks
the
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
massachusetts
supreme
court.
