justice
thurgood
marshall
does
it
show
that
one
picture
of
one
nude
child
harms
that
child?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
that
study
show
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
that
study?
will
you
tell
me
please?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
says
that
one
picture
of
a
nude
child
injures
the
child.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn't
say
what
children.
i
said
a--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--one
picture
of
a,
one,
child.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
want
that
quote.
where
is
that
quote?
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
the
report
that
says
the
picture
of
one
child
taken
one
time
injures
that
child.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
includes
a
picture
taken
by
a
child
that
the
child
didn't
know
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
was
not
in
my
hypothetical.
my
hypothetical
is
the
child
is
down
on
the
beach
in
the
nude
and
he
sees
nobody
else
out
on
the
beach
and
somebody
takes
a
picture,
that
that
injures
the
child?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
so,
then
your
statement
is
not
correct.
the
child
is
not
injured
automatically.
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
you
ever
seen
baby
pictures
of
a
child...
a
nude
child
on
a
rug,
on
a
bear
skin?
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
lot
of
them,
haven't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
those
children
are
all
injured?
justice
thurgood
marshall
those
children
are
all
injured?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
wouldn't
they
be
covered
by
this
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
counsel,
do
you
admit
that
there
is
a
psychological
damage
to
these
children
who
are
photographed
in
the
nude?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
do
you
say
in
contrast
to
what
they
say--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--in
the
opinions
and
briefs
and
all
of
the
lot?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
the
difference
between
taking
the
picture
of
a
child
frolicking
in
the
sand
in
the
nude
and
being
taken
upstairs,
downstairs
and
put
on
a
bar
and
told
to
take
her
clothes
off?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
do
see
a
difference,
don't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
xxx.
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
xxx.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
the
statute
applies
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
the
state
cannot
prohibit
a
father
from
taking
his
child
downstairs
in
the
basement,
telling
her
to
get
up
on
a
bar,
take
her
clothes
off
and
put
a
shawl
around
her?
and
the
state
can't
prohibit
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no.
i
said
can
a
state
prohibit
that
action?
justice
thurgood
marshall
with
properly
drawn
statutes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes...
yes,
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there's
no...
you
can't
draw
a
statute
on
that?
