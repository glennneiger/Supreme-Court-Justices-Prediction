justice
antonin
scalia
general
shannon,
suppose
we,
on
the
overbreadth
problems,
simply
said,
well,
the...
the
only
reason
we
have
this
overbreadth
rule
is
in
order
to
prevent
legitimate
first
amendment
activity
from
being
stifled
and
deterred.
but
now
that
the
massachusetts
legislature,
the
supreme
court
of
massachusetts,
the
supreme
legislative
court,
has
modified
the
statute,
there's
no
real
problem
about
that
anymore.
there's...
there's
no
inhibitory
effect
of
this
statute
anymore,
so
we
shouldn't
consider
overbreadth.
could
we
decide
the
case
that
way,
and
if
we
did,
would
that...
would
that
satisfy
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
even
if
it
was
overbroad,
it
is
certainly
not
inhibiting
anybody
anymore
because
the
massachusetts
legislature
has
amended
it.
so,
why
can't
we
say...
you
know,
just
send
it
back
and
say
if
this
conviction
is
a
valid
conviction,
it
can
stand?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
there's
no
overbreadth
problem
anymore
even
if
there...
you
know,
even
if
there--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you'd
be
stuck
with
a
new
statute
though.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
you
can
only
prosecute
under
the
new
statute.
the
commonwealth
hasn't
said
you
can
prosecute
under
the
new
or
the
old,
have
they?
i
mean,
isn't
the
old
statute
gone
now?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
there's
no...
no
inhibitory
effect
then
and
there's
no
possible
harm
to
be
done
by
overbreadth
of
the
old
statute.
it's
gone.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
your
client
could...
could
properly
have
been
convicted
under
a
narrowly
drawn
statute,
he
was
properly
convicted.
and
if...
if
others
were
wrongfully
deterred
by
that
old
statute,
it
doesn't
matter
because
that
statute
is
not
there
anymore.
justice
antonin
scalia
everybody
wins
except
your
client.
all...
all
your
amici
will
abandon
you,
and
it's
just
your
client
that
suffers
from
the
old
statute.
is
that
right,
mr.
vita?
isn't
it
true
that
if
we
reverse,
the
old
statute
would
come
back
to
life
and
people
who
were
committing
these
acts
before
the
new
statute
was
passed
would
be
subject
to
prosecution.
the
attorney
general
said
there
are
a
number
of
pending
cases
they
don't
know
what
to
do
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
would
be
prosecuted
if
we
reverse.
that's
why
he
wants
us
to
reverse
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr....
mr.
vita,
may
i
ask?
assuming
as...
as
everybody
seems
to
assume,
that
there's
a
constitutional
right
to
take
a
picture
of
your
baby
on
a
bear
skin
rug,
which...
which
i'm
not
sure
of,
but
let's
assume
that
that's
so,
why
is
your
claim
of
overbreadth
a
first
amendment
claim
of
overbreadth
as
opposed
to
a
claim
of
overbreadth
on...
based
on
some
other
constitutional
ground?
specifically,
you
would
acknowledge,
would
you
not,
that
the
state
could
make
it
unlawful
and
criminal
to
take
a
picture
of
an
individual
naked
without
that
individual's
knowledge
or
consent,
for
somebody
to
sneak
in
and
use
a
telephoto
lens
taking
a
picture
of
you
or
me
taking
a
shower?
can
a
state
make
that
unlawful?
you're
not
sure
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
certainly
hope
it
can.
you
mean
the
first
amendment
requires
that
people
should
be
able
to
go
around
taking
photographs
of
other
people
in
the
nude
without
their
knowledge
or
consent.
it
doesn't
require
that,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sure
there
are
a
lot
of
civil
prohibitions
which
would
likewise
fall
under
the
first
amendment
bar
if...
if
the
first
amendment
prevented
it.
certainly
it
would
be
an
invasion
of
privacy,
wouldn't
you...
wouldn't
it?
you're
not
sure
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let's
assume
i
don't...
i
was...
i
thought
that
was
an
easy
question.
my
second
question,
which
was...
i...
i
also
thought
was
easy,
could
the
state
make
it
unlawful
for
someone
to
take
a
picture
of
a
minor
without
the
minor's...
in
the
nude
without
the
minor's
parents'
consent?
and
again,
that
seems
to
me
like
a
pretty
easy
question.
even
if
you
want
to
take
a
picture
of
your
own
baby
in
the
nude
on
a
bear
skin
rug,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
other
people
ought
to
be
able
to
do
that
if
you
don't
want
it
done.
now,
if
all
of
that
is
true,
then,
it
seems
to
me,
we
have
established
the
principle
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
absolutely
mean
that
people
can
take
pictures
of
other
people
in
the
nude
without
their
consent.
and
all
we're
talking
about
is
whether
the
government
can
prevent
parents
from
giving
that
consent.
now,
that
be
a
constitutional
prohibition.
maybe
the
government
can't.
maybe
the
government
can't
prevent
parents
from
giving
their
consent,
but
if
that's
a
problem,
it's
not
a
first
amendment
problem.
it's
a
problem
to
what
extent
the
government
can
intrude
into
the
parent-child
relationship.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
first
amendment.
and
therefore,
the
overbreadth
problem
wouldn't
exist
unless,
of
course,
you
disagree
in
your
answer
to
the
other
two
questions
which
i...
i
gather
you
do
and
were
wise
to
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
your
expression
stops
at
my
body.
and
if
i
don't
want
particularly
want
you
to
take
a
picture
of
me
in
the
nude,
i
don't
have
to,
do
i?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
you're
talking
about
the
first
amendment
with
the
bear
skin
rug
examples.
i
think
you're
talking
about
some
ability
of
parents
to...
to...
to
control
their
relationship
with
their
child.
but
that's
not
the
first
amendment
anymore.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think--
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
and
i
suppose
i
can't
say
categorically
that
every
young
woman
below
the
age
of...
of...
of
legal
consent
who...
who
is
statutorily
raped
is
harmed
either.
i
can't
say
that,
but
i
can
make
a
generalization
and
make
it
a
crime
to
have
intercourse
with
a
young
woman
below
a
certain
age
even
though
i
can't...
i
can't
absolutely
swear
that
every...
every
young
woman
below
that
age
who...
who
gives
her
consent
doesn't
know
what
she's
doing
and
is
therefore
being
harmed.
but
i
can
make
it
a
crime
anyway,
can't
i,
on
the
basis
of
general
assumptions?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
if
this
15-year
old
had
said
to
her
stepfather,
daddy,
i
don't
want
to
do
this,
and
he
said
don't
worry.
it's...
you've
got
to
do
it
because
this
is
not
going
to
be
a
lascivious
photograph.
and
she
says
i...
i
just
really
don't...
i
don't
want
to.
there's
nothing
the
state
can
do
to
protect
that
child?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
find
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
they're
sexually
exploitive.
justice
antonin
scalia
only
if
they're
sexually
exploitive,
otherwise
the
child
must
submit
to
the...
to
the
parent's
desire
to
take
the
photographs.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
your...
your
answer
is
the
same,
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
if
it
weren't
the
father.
if
it
were...
if
it
were
a
stranger
who...
who
induced
the
young
woman
to
do
that
so
long
as
he
didn't
twist
her
arm,
of
course,
the
state
could
not
prohibit
that
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
the
parents
or
not
have
to
do
with
the
first
amendment?
that's
a
different
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
that's...
if
that's
the
claim
of
overbreadth,
it's
not
overbreadth
that
we
take
cognizance
of.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
the
old
statute
repealed?
