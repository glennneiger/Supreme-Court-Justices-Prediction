mr.
david
rudovsky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
a
threshold
matter,
i
wish
to
call
this
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
issue
that
the
city
says
is
properly
before
this
court,
as
they
say,
a
failure
to
train
can
never
amount
to
a
policy,
as
that
term
is
defined
in
monell,
is
not
properly
before
this
court.
not
only
did
the
city
not
appeal
from
the
underlying
judgment
that
there
was
a
14th
amendment
violation
here
in
the
sense
that
mrs.
harris
was
denied
a
right
to
necessary
medical
care,
and
the
record
does
support
that
judgment,
but
at
trial,
this
case
was
tried
on
a
simple
negligence
theory
because
the
city
pre-trial,
in
its
pre-trial
brief,
and
i've
cited
it
at
page
nine
of
our
brief,
on
the
merits,
conceded
that
if
the
plaintiff
proved
that
the
actions
of
the
city
as
the
result
of
misfeasance
and
nonfeasance
by
failing
to
adequately
train,
supervise,
or
discipline
members
of
the
police
offices,
proximally
caused
the
injury
in
this
case,
the
city
could
be
held
properly
liable.
mr.
david
rudovsky
i
personally
was
not
on
the
case
at
that
point,
but
in
the
opposition
to
certiorari,
and
i
will
get
to
that
point,
even
at
the
stage
of
opposition
of
certiorari,
the
city's
submission
on
the
certiorari
petition
was
not
that
training
can
never
amount
to
a
policy
under
monell.
this
question
submitted,
on
which
this
court
granted
cert,
was
whether
or
not
monell
liability
could
be
found
where
violations
of
constitutional
rights
might
foreseeably
result
from
inadequate
training.
that
is,
in
this
petition
for
certiorari
itself,
the
city
reaffirmed
the
position
it
took
in
the
trial
court
that
negligence
alone
could
be
a
basis
for
finding
that
a
failure
to
train
amounts
to
a
policy
under
monell.
not
only
did
the
city
make
that
position
clear
pre-trial,
and
therefore
this
case
was
tried,
and
the
evidence
was
produced,
on
a
theory
of
simple
negligence,
but
in
the
court
of
appeals,
in
its
petition
for
rehearing
before
the
court
of
appeals,
the
city
stated,
and
we
quoted
the
page
11
of
our
brief,
in
its
petition
for
rehearing,
the
city
says,
the
majority
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
"quite
correctly,
in
our
view,
states
that
grossly
inadequate
training
may
be
a
basis
for
a
city's
liability
under
42
section
u.s.
1983.
"
so
that
the
position
of
the
city
consistently,
pre-trial,
on
appeal
in
the
court
of
appeals,
in
it's
petition
for
certiorari
to
this
court,
which
is
why
we
didn't
make
the
response
that
would
normally
be
called
for
under
tuttle,
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
the
issue
is
not
properly
before
it,
the
city's
consistent
position
is
diametrically
opposed
to
what
it
suggests
to
this
court
today.
now,
the
two
reasons
this
court
has
traditionally
given
for
not
deciding
issues
which
are
not
properly
preserved
below,
both
strongly
counsel
against
this
court
deciding
this
case
on
the
submission
of
the
city.
number
one,
you
have
the
possibility...
and
we're
not
certainly
accusing
the
city
of
doing
it
here...
of
preserving
an
issue
for
appeal
by
suggesting
an
erroneous
legal
standard
at
trial.
they
say
at
trial
mere
inevidence
is
sufficient,
and
now
they
say
both
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
were
wrong
for
adopting
that
position.
well,
they
can't
have
it,
when
they
themselves
suggested
that
position.
mr.
david
rudovsky
as
i
said
to
justice
white,
the
opposition,
which
i
did
not
file,
i
did
not
become
part
of
this
case
until
the
brief
on
the
merits,
that
point
was
not
made
in
the
opposition
brief,
but
it
was
not
made,
as
in
kibbe,
the
same
reason,
because
the
brief
for
certiorari,
the
petition
for
certiorari,
itself
expressed
this
issue
in
terms
of
inadequate
training,
which
was
the
same
position
as
taken
by
the
court
below.
secondly,
the
city
now
says
that
we
didn't
adduce
sufficient
proof
to
meet
the
standard
they
suggest
of,
as
best
i
can
tell
its
intentionality,
its,
we
don't
state
a
claim
under
monell
unless
we
show
that
the
failure
to
train
was
done
with
the
intent
to
violate
citizens'
rights.
the
city
now
says
that
we
haven't
adduced
enough
proof,
if
that's
the
proper
standard.
well,
of
course
we
haven't.
we
think
the
proof
could
meet
that
standard,
but
this
case
was
tried
under
a
simple
negligence
theory.
there
was
no
burden
on
the
plaintiff
at
trial,
given
the
very
position
of
the
city,
to
adduce
proof
that
would
meet
deliberate
indifference
or
intentionality.
and
so
both
issues
that
are
supposedly
before
this
court,
number
one,
the
question
of
what
standard
applies
under
a
failure
to
train,
and
the
question,
the
underlying
question...
because
a
new
trial
has
already
been
granted
in
this
case,
the
city
will
have
another
chance.
the
question
of
whether
there
was
sufficient
proof
to
meet
whatever
standard
this
court
would
announce
controls
the
question
of
failure
to
train,
the
plaintiff
didn't
have
a
proper
opportunity
to
provide
that
proof,
because
we
tried
it
under
the
theory
that
the
city
made.
in
tuttle,
as
justice
white's
question
suggests,
this
court
said,
properly
so.
the
respondent
ought
to
point
out
to
this
court
where
an
issue
has
not
been
properly
preserved.
i've
explained
why
we
didn't
do
that.
this
is
the
fourth
time
in
as
many
years
that
this
court
has
taken
a
case
concerning
municipal
liability
on
a
city's
petition
where
there
have
been
substantial
questions
over
whether
the
issue
was
properly
preserved
in
the
lower
courts.
tuttle,
praprotnik,
kibbe,
and
now
this
case,
and
indeed
newport,
the
city
of
newport
case,
had
the
same
problem
as
well.
it's
one
thing
to
say
to
the
respondent,
you
should
point
it
out.
here
we
didn't
because
it
wasn't
properly
posed.
we
think
as
a
corollary
to
the
tuttle
rule
a
petitioner
as
an
officer
of
this
court
ought
to
at
least
in
its
petition
for
certiorari
point
out
what
might
be
arguable
grounds,
and
here
they
were
abundant,
as
to
why
the
issue
was
not
properly
preserved.
mr.
david
rudovsky
as
worded,
they
are.
but,
as
worded,
as
i
read
it,
and
it's
a
little
unclear
to
me
exactly
what
the
point
was,
it
seems
to
repeat
this
simple
negligence
question.
that
is,
the
city
says,
in
this
question
presented,
is
negligence,
which
is
the
foreseeability
standard
that's
suggested
here,
and
inadequate
training
sufficient
to
state
municipal
liability
under
monell.
well,
we
think
the
answer
to
that
is
yes,
simple
negligence
is
that.
but
that
is
not
the
argument
they
are
currently
making.
they
are
now
trying
to
ratchet
up
the
culpability
requirement
all
the
way
up
to
intentionality
when
throughout
this
case
they
have
said
simple
negligence,
or
at
one
point
under
a
motion
for
directed
verdict
they
used
the
term
gross
negligence,
would
be
sufficient.
mr.
david
rudovsky
i
certainly
concede
that,
and
the
brief
in
opposition
didn't,
i
think,
for
the
reason
that
it
appeared
that
the
city
was
taking
the
same
position
in
its
petition
for
certiorari
that
it
took
in
the
lower
court,
that
is
whether
simple
negligence
would
be
sufficient.
that
issue
is
before
the
court,
and
there's
certainly
abundant
evidence,
as
i
will
get
to
in
a
moment,
to
support
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
remanding
for
a
new
trial
on
a
theory
that
negligence
in
terms
of
training,
which
foreseeably
would
raise
a
risk
of
a
violation
of
constitutional
rights,
and
would
raise
a
risk
of
danger
to
the
public,
would
be
sufficient.
now,
this
court
has
debated
the
underlying
issue
in
several
opinions.
but
as
presented
to
this
court,
all
the
city
properly
preserved
was
that
lower
threshold
issue.
and
we
think
because
the
facts
were
not
fully
developed--
mr.
david
rudovsky
--not
in
those
terms,
because
they
have
conceded--
mr.
david
rudovsky
--that's
true.
but
given
their
position
in
the
court
below,
where
they
expressly
conceded,
indeed
at
a
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
court
of
appeals,
they
expressly
conceded
chat
issue.
we
are--
mr.
david
rudovsky
--we
raised
it
as
they
did
in
kibbe,
at
the
first
opportunity
where
it
became
clear
to
us
that
they
are
now
changing
their
position.
kibbe
was
the
same
situation.
in
kibbe
the
argument
by
the
respondent
that
cert
was
improperly
granted
was
raised
for
the
first
time
on
the
merits
brief,
because
that's
the
first
time
it
became
clear
to
the
respondent
that
the
petition
was
changing
grounds,
and
a
majority
of
this
court
dismissed
cert
as
improperly
granted
in
kibbe.
this
is
even
stronger
than
kibbe,
because
at
least
in
kibbe
the
city
had
by
motion
for
directed
verdict
preserved,
or
attempted
to
preserve
that
issue
in
the
lower
court.
and
remember,
in
kibbe,
when
this
court
dismissed
cert,
it
meant
the
city
was
held
liable.
there
wasn't
a
new
trial
situation
in
kibbe.
that
meant
the
judgment
of
damages
was
affirmed.
here
there's
going
to
be
a
new
trial
under
any
circumstances.
and
we
think
that
you
don't
have
a
full
record
on
which
to
decide,
in
this
case,
because
of
what
the
city
did,
this
very
important
question,
which
has
pretty
broad
ramifications
in
terms
of
municipal
liability.
if
i
may,
i
will
turn,
however,
assuming
this
court
reaches
the
merits
of
this
case--
mr.
david
rudovsky
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
for
the
same
reason
that
the
court
did
in
kibbe,
we
think
it's--
mr.
david
rudovsky
--and
obviously
it's
discretionary.
sometimes
you
have
dismissed,
sometimes
you
haven't.
but
we
think
of
the
five
cases
in
the
past
seven
years
that
have
raised
this
issue,
this
is
the
strongest
case
of
the
clearest
change
in
position
by
a
petitioner
from
the
trial
court
to
this
court.
and
there's
no
basis
on
which
to
hear
this
particular
issue.
mr.
david
rudovsky
it's
certainly
discretionary
in
this
court.
but
the
factors
the
court
has
pointed
to
in
deciding
whether
we
hear
it
or
whether
we
don't,
tuttle
v.
kibbe
for
example,
tuttle
you
heard
it,
kibbe
you
didn't,
when
you
look
at
those
factors
they
counsel
most
strongly
against
hearing
this
particular
case.
and
that's
our
basic
submission
on
that
point.
but
i
do
want
to
move
to
the
merits,
because
the
court
certainly
can
address
the
merits,
and
we
differ
quite
sharply
with
opposing
counsel,
both
on
the
facts
in
this
case
and
on
the
submission
we
make
with
respect
to
the
proper
legal
principle
that
controls.
two
significant
facts
that
have
to
be
kept
in
mind,
because
we
are
arguing
both
a
custom
of
denying
medical
care
to
a
certain
class
of
prisoners,
and
a
failure
to
train
police
that
led
to
this
particular
violation.
we're
arguing
both
and
we
will
submit
in
conclusion
that
the
confluence
of
those
doctrines
clearly
established
municipal
liability
here.
but
as
a
predicate,
there
are
two
significant
facts
that
we
produced
at
trial
which
are
quite
important.
number
one,
with
respect
to
our
submission
that
there
is
a
practice
and
custom
in
the
city
of
canton
of
withholding
medical
care
for
persons
who
the
police
think
are
emotionally
disturbed,
as
opposed
to
suffering
from
physical
ailments,
the
custom
was
established
not
by
a
series
of
incidents
that
we
proved
but
by
testimony
of
a
police
officer,
not
that
he
withheld
care
in
these
cases,
but
officer
norsia,
as
we
cite
in
our
brief,
testified
that
he
was
trained
not
to
provide
medical
care
to
persons
who
the
officer
believed
was
suffering
from
emotional
distress
unless
that
person
became
seriously
dangerous
to
herself.
mr.
david
rudovsky
i
don't
think
it's
an
equal
protection
matter.
i
think
when
the
city--
mr.
david
rudovsky
--no,
no.
we
don't
make
an
equal
protection
argument.
we
say
that
someone
who
is
mentally
disturbed,
as
mrs.
harris,
was,
and
in
fact
was,
as
the
jury
finding
mandates
in
this
case,
was
denied
necessary
medical
attention.
the
policy...
not
the
policy,
the
practice
and
custom
of
denying
medical
care
to
people
in
that
situation,
until
they
became
literally
dangerous
to
themselves,
which
she
wasn't,
she
wasn't
trying
to
commit
suicide,
she
wasn't
trying
to
hurt
herself,
means
that
in
a
class
of
cases
persons
who
are
in
need
of
medical
attention
will
not
be
given
that
medical
attention.
and
we
don't
seek
to
support
the
verdict
on
a
single
incident
theory.
if
this
was
just
a
single
incident,
this
was
the
one
time
it
happened,
we
would
agree--
mr.
david
rudovsky
--her
right,
ultimately
her
right
under
the
14th
amendment
to
necessary
medical
care
as
a
person
in
custody,
pre-trial
custody.
the
violation
under
monell
is
that
the
custom
of
the
city,
the
practice
of
the
city
which
ultimately
caused
this
officer
to
withhold
medical
care,
as
he
said,
the
reason
we
withheld
medical
care
is
that
we
were
trained,
don't
seek
medical
care
to
someone
in
mrs.
harris'
condition.
that's
the
basic
testimony.
and
his
testimony
was
not
that--
mr.
david
rudovsky
--well,
you
have
to
remember,
though,
the
facts
in
this
case.
this
is--
mr.
david
rudovsky
--it,
it
may
have
been
the
opinion.
but
when
you
apply
it
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
where
mrs.
harris,
when
she
gets
to
the
police
station,
is
disoriented,
she's
incoherent,
she's
hyperventilating,
and
she
literally
cannot
even
sit
on
a
chair.
she
continues
to
fall
to
the
floor,
faints
at
one
point,
in
fact.
someone
in
that
condition,
and
i'll
get
to
this
point,
number
one,
may
not
be
just
emotionally
disturbed,
they
could
be
suffering
a
heart
attack.
but
if
the
officer
makes
the
judgment,
well,
this
is
just
a
nervous
arrestee,
that
person
will
never
receive
medical
care
in
the
city
of
canton,
until
as
in
this
case
her
son
has
to
come
to
the
police
station...
this
question
of
who
provided
medical
care,
justice
marshall...
her
son
comes
and
says
to
the
officer,
my
mother
is
lying
on
this
dirty
cell,
she's
hyperventilating,
she's
hysterical,
would
you
call
a
doctor?
and
they
said
no.
you
call
the
doctor.
he
calls
a
doctor,
the
doctor
comes
or
the
ambulance
comes,
they
put
her
on
a
stretcher,
they're
taking
her
out
in
this
condition,
and
what
do
the
police
do?
they
delay
her
transportation
to
the
hospital
because
they
say
we
have
to
fingerprint
her.
this
was
a
callous
disregard
of
this
woman's
rights
to
medical
care.
and
it
was
caused,
which
is
a
critical
question
here,
was
it
caused
by
the
city?
remember
language
of
1983,
subjects
or
causes
to
be
subjected
to
un-constitutional
deprivations.
mr.
david
rudovsky
there
is.
and
i
will
get
to
the
policy
in
one
moment.
the
custom,
though,
which
this
court
as
a
legal
matter
has
clearly
recognized
in
monell
and
adickes,
is
established
by
the
officer's
testimony,
not
that
i
do
it
but
that
this
is
the
way
the
police
department
is
trained.
mr.
david
rudovsky
in
effect,
justice
kennedy,
this
custom
and
practice
becomes
the
policy.
this
written
regulation
that
we
have
now
has
been
superseded,
at
least
in
cases
with
respect
to
emotionally
disturbed
persons.
mr.
david
rudovsky
i
think
it
amounts
to
a
policy,
although
this
court,
and
the
reason
i
hesitate
to
say
blanketly
it's
a
policy,
is
that
this
court
has
used
the
terminology
"practice
and
custom"
where
you
have
a
written
regulation
which
is
supposedly
the
policy,
and
then
over
time
officers
by
lack
of
training
or
supervision
adopt
a
different
practice.
and
that's
why
i
use
the
term
"custom
and
practice",
and
i
will
get
to
the
policy
of
lack
of
training.
mr.
david
rudovsky
that
is
the
testimony.
but
the
important--
mr.
david
rudovsky
--oh,
the
other
factor
i
want
to
mention
in
terms
of
the
other
piece
of
evidence
is
the
testimony
of
the
chief
of
police,
who
at
least
at
the
time
he
testified
was
the
chief
of
police,
who
testified
that
we
give
no
training...
we're
not
talking
about
inadequate
training...
we
give
no
training
to
police
to
help
them
distinguish
between
symptoms
that
may
just
be
symptoms
of
an
emotional
disturbance,
as
opposed
to
physical
problems.
no
training
with
respect
to
symptoms
of
someone
in
emotional
distress,
no
training
with
respect
to
symptoms
of
someone
who
may
be
having
a
heart
attack,
no
training
with
respect
to
symptoms
of
someone
who
has
respiratory
problems.
now,
that
fits
into
the
lack
of
training
policy
prong
of
our
argument.
not
only
do
you
have
this
underlying
custom,
which
has
now
become
un-constitutional,
but
it
gets
aggravated
by
the
fact
that
the
police
are
not
even
trained
to
distinguish
properly
between
emotionally
disturbed
people
and
those
suffering
physical
ailments.
that
is,
in
this
case
it
may
have
turned
out
to
be
a
physical
ailment.
but
if
this
case
was
a
heart
attack,
if
this
case
was
a
heart
attack,
which
it
well
could
have
been,
given
her
symptoms,
the
officer
for
two
reasons
would
have
been
caused
not
to
act
by
the
city's
policy,
one,
he's
made
a
determination
that
it's
a
mental
instability
and
therefore
we
won't
get
training,
and
two,
he's
made
that
decision
incorrectly
because
he
hasn't
even
been
given
the
rudimentary
training
that's
necessary
for
a
police
officer
in
that
situation.
and
we're
not
talking
about
400
hours
of
training
in
this
case.
we're
not
talking
about
the
most
sophisticated
medical
training.
we're
not
talking
about
a
doctor
in
the
station.
all
we're
saying
is
that
when
you
give
police
officials
in
the
station
decisions
that
could
be
in
some
circumstances
life
or
death,
you
have
to
give
them
at
least
some
basis
upon
which
to
make
those
decisions.
it's
the
point
i
think
that
justice
stevens
made
in
his
question
to
opposing
counsel.
if
you
give
a
police
officer
a
gun,
you've
got
some
responsibility
under
this
court's
decision
in
garner
to
tell
that
police
officer,
you
can't
use
that
weapon
to
stop
every
fleeing
felon.
mr.
david
rudovsky
they
may
under
state
law.
mr.
david
rudovsky
but
they
certainly
don't
under
the
constitution.
mr.
david
rudovsky
in
some
states
the
failure
to
provide
training
to
security
guards...
is
that
the
question?
mr.
david
rudovsky
no.
a
hotel
desk
clerk,
i
don't
think
so,
nor
would
i
say,
justice
kennedy,
that
you
would
have
to
train
an
officer--
mr.
david
rudovsky
--well,
in
this
case
it
amounts
to
two
hours,
and
it
could
have
been
more.
but--
mr.
david
rudovsky
--no.
the
testimony
in
this
case,
i
think
that's
just
a
misstatement
of
the
facts.
there
was
testimony
where
the
jury
could
have
found
that
she
was
in
custody
for
two
hours.
her
son,
ronny
harris,
said
he
got
to
the
station
around
10:00
o'clock,
which
was
two
hours
after
she
was
arrested.
and
we
certainly
are
entitled
to
that
inference,
given
that
we
were
the
verdict
winner
in
the
trial
court.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
every
officer
has
to
be
trained
in
this
regard.
the
jailer
has
to
be
trained.
the
person
who
makes
that
decision
has
to
be
trained,
in
the
same
way
the
jailer
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
be
trained
about
hostage-taking
situations.
the
jailer's
not
going
to
find
himself
in
that
kind
of
a
situation
probably.
if
there's
a
hostage
unit
in
a
city,
well
those
are
the
people
you
train
with
respect
to
taking
hostages.
but
any
police
officer
who
in
his
normal
course,
or
her
normal
course,
exercises
powers
of
arrest,
exercises
powers
sometimes
of
lethal
force,
at
a
minimum
consistent
with
this
court's
opinions,
have
to
know
when
to
use
it
and
when
not.
and
it
certainly
is
not
counter-intuitive
to
suggest
that
one
who
is
not
properly
trained,
who
receives
no
instructions
that
you
cannot
use
lethal
force
against
a
fleeing
pickpocket,
is
not
as
readily
going
to
cause
or
commit
a
violation
of
constitutional
rights
than
the
very
policy
in
garner,
which
this
court
condemned,
which
just
permitted
the
use
of
deadly
force
in
that
kind
of
situation.
either
one
can
as
readily
cause
the
underlying
constitutional
violation
as
the
other.
and
that's
why
we
suggest
that
the
proper
standard,
the
proper
standard
in
determining
whether
or
not
failure
to
train
amounts
to
a
violation
of
section
1983
is
best
determined
on
a
theory
of
gross
negligence.
that
theory
would
require
the
plaintiff
to
prove,
and
it's
ultimately
the
burden
of
proof
of
the
plaintiff,
to
demonstrate
that
the
failure
to
train
in
a
particular
situation--
mr.
david
rudovsky
--no.
i
think
that
gross
negligence
has
a
basis
both
in
some
of
the
opinions
of
this
court,
and
certainly
some
of
the
opinions
of
the
lower
court.
but
more
important,
we
think
it
satisfies
what
monell
requires.
mr.
david
rudovsky
i
have
some
law
students
who
i
teach
in
the
courtroom
and,
they've
been
unsatisfied
with
some
of
my
definitions,
as
we
go
along
the
continuum
of
culpability.
i'm
not
going
to
stand
before
this
court
and
say,
i
can
give
a
precise
formulation
as
to
when
negligence
folds
into
gross
negligence,
when
gross
negligence
folds
into
deliberate
indifference,
when
deliberate
indifference
folds
into
intentionality.
but
gross
negligence
as
understood,
and
certainly
in
terms
of
agency
principles,
which
are
well-established,
it
is
not
unfair
to
say
to
a
city
that
if
you
adopt
a
policy,
and
this
is
a
deliberate
choice,
you
either
train
or
you
don't
train,
that's
certainly
a
choice
made
by
a
city
official,
that
creates
a
high-risk
and
a
high
degree
of
foreseeability,
which
is
gross
negligence,
to
the
citizens
of
the
community
in
that
particular
area
where
you
don't
train,
and
in
fact
a
constitutional
violation
occurs,
a
jury
can
find,
a
jury
can
find
both
causation
and
we
also
have
fault.
i'm
not
suggesting
a
no-fault
standard
here.
monell
says
we
need
causation,
and
we
need
fault.
gross
negligence
meets
the
fault
standard,
and
indeed
when
you
think
about
the
notion
of
causation,
you
can
have
causation
whether
or
not
you
have
fault.
whether
in
fact
an
officer
doesn't
get
trained
under
garner
deliberately,
or
the
city
just
forgets
to
train
that
officer,
the
result
can
be
the
same,
the
person
gets
shot
regardless
of
the
question
of
fault.
but
we
recognize
that
fault
is
a
component
of
monell,
and
indeed
as
justice
o'connor
noted
in
her
opinion
in
dissent,
in
the
kibbe
case,
she
would
require
some
higher
level
of
culpability
to
ensure
that
there
was
in
fact
causation,
that
a
jury's
not
speculating.
i
think
where
i
disagree
somewhat
with
that
analysis
is
to
the
level
of
culpability
you
require.
remember,
to
the
degree
it
was
suggested
in
that
dissenting
opinion,
that
we
don't
know
whether
the
officer
acted
because
of
lack
of
training
or
because
of
predisposition
or
because
of
some
kind
of
malice
toward
the
plaintiff,
we're
concerned
about
a
jury
speculating
on,
on,
on
causation,
and
then
we
get
into
the
respondeat
superior
situation.
mr.
david
rudovsky
you
might
in
some
cases.
now,
i
think
where
we
differ--
mr.
david
rudovsky
--well,
but
i
think
that's
the
definition
of
gross
negligence.
gross
negligence
suggests
a
high
degree
of
foreseeability
and
a
high
degree
of
risk
in
terms
of
danger.
once
you
get--
mr.
david
rudovsky
--i
think
the
response
to
that,
justice
scalia,
in
part
is
that
to
the
degree
you're
worried
that
the
jury
may
be
deciding
on
some
other
basis,
and
maybe
the
officer
acted
not
because
of
lack
of
training
but
because
of
predisposition,
say,
and
how
do
we
know?
well,
the
city
can
call
that
officer
at
trial.
they
city
can
call
the
officer
and
say,
officer,
in
this
case,
did
you
not
provide
medical
care
because
of
lack
of
training,
or
was
it
some
other
predisposition?
this
officer
might
have
said,
look,
i
wasn't
trained
properly.
we
had
a
custom
of
denying
medical
care.
but
that's
not
the
reason
i
didn't
send
her
to
the
hospital.
i
knew
she
needed
medical
attention.
i
didn't
send
her
because
she
gave
my
fellow
officer
a
hard
time
out
on
the
street.
well,
if
the
jury
accepts
that
testimony,
and
it
can
be
produced
by
the
city,
then
there's
a
question
on
causation.
mr.
david
rudovsky
not
only
is
it
realistic--
mr.
david
rudovsky
--i
have
seen
it
happen
in
the
qualified
immunity
context,
where
the
officer
in
fact
says,
i
acted
the
way
i
acted
because
i
wasn't
properly
trained.
and
in
these
cases,
remember,
municipalities
are
different
defendants
from
the
individual,
and
sometimes
they
have
different
lawyers,
and
sometimes
they're
at
odds.
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
to
the
degree
you're
worried
that
the
failure
to
train
didn't
cause
the
violation,
that
it
may
have
been
something
else,
that's
a
matter,
that's
a
matter
for
evidence.
when
you
look
at
principles
of
agency...
now
we're
not
dealing
with
respondeat
superior...
a
basic
principle
of
agency
which
was
established
in
1871
when
this
act
was
passed,
and
which
is
now
codified
in
the
restatement,
is
that
a
principle,
the
employer,
is
generally
responsible
for
failure
to
control,
supervise,
and
discipline
employees,
a
simple
negligence
standard
which
we're
not
suggesting
here.
the
courts
have
not
had
trouble
adjudicating
that
principle.
they
haven't
had
trouble
deciding
when
in
fact
the
employer's
failure
to
control
was
the
causation
factor
for
the
ultimate
violation.
these
are
settled
principles
that
common
law
courts
have
applied
for
decades
without
much
difficulty,
and
we
don't
think
that
a
federal
court
in
a
civil
rights
action
properly
charged,
a
jury
that's
properly
charged,
will
have
difficulty.
nor
do
we
think
that
error
is
a
one-way
street,
that
is
that
a
jury
will
always
find
causation
when
causation
didn't
occur,
as
opposed
to
the
other
problem.
there
will
be
situations
where,
under
the
standard,
a
jury
perhaps
will
find,
even
under
gross
negligence,
will
not
find
causation,
where
maybe
in
fact
it
existed.
causation
obviously
is
a
very
elusive
concept.
but
we're
stuck
with
it
as
a
matter
of
tort
principle,
and
certainly
as
a
matter
in
this
court's
jurisprudence
on
section
1983,
the
statute
itself
talks
about,
subjects,
or
causes
to
be
subjected.
if
you
look
for
the
most
analogous
principle
in
common
law
tort,
and
certainly
this
court
time
and
again
has
said,
we
look
to
common
law
tort
principles
on
occasion
in
fleshing
out
1983,
the
agency
principle
of
an
employer
controlling
an
employee
certainly
has
sufficient
bite,
has
sufficient
experience,
and
has
sufficient
general
acceptance
in
the
jurisprudence
of
this
country
for
it
to
be
the
standard
here.
mr.
david
rudovsky
yes.
mr.
david
rudovsky
counsel
who
filed
that
did
not
respond
to
that.
but
recall,
this
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
when
kibbe
was
pending.
kibbe
had
not
yet
been
decided.
and
remember,
in
kibbe
you
found
that
that
issue
was
not
properly
preserved
either.
mr.
david
rudovsky
i
won't
quarrel
with
you
on
that.
i
think,
in
retrospect,
if
i
had
written
that
opposition,
i
probably
would
have
pointed
that
out.
but
given
this
almost
right-hand
turn
the
city
has
now
taken
from
the
trial
court
here,
you're
left
with
a
totally
imperfect
record.
we're
sandbagged
because
we
couldn't
even
present
the
evidence
that
would
have
met
the
standard
they
now
say
should
be
the
standard
that
controls
decision
in
this
case.
this
matter
has
already
been
remanded
for
a
new
trial
by
the
sixth
circuit.
the
case
can
be
retried
under
a
proper
standard,
with
both
parties
allowed
to
present
the
evidence
that
would
support
each
side's
theory,
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment
in
that
regard.
mr.
david
rudovsky
not
necessarily.
a
lot
of
water
has
gone
over
the
dam
since
the
court
of
appeals
spoke.
and
it
seems
to
us,
first
of
all,
the
court
of
appeals
standard
was
right.
the
gross
negligence
standard
that
they
articulated
was
right.
and
that's
presumably--
mr.
david
rudovsky
--it's
certainly
a
problem
in
terms
of
this
tension
between
a
record
that
is
not
properly
preserved
and
an
issue
you
want
to
decide,
and
we
agree,
ought
to
be
decided
at
some
point.
but
an
issue
of
this
importance,
and
this
court
has
done
this
before
when...
negligence,
it
took
you
three
times
finally
to
decide
that,
in
terms
of
whether
negligence
states
a
cause
of
action
in
1983,
we
don't
think
it,
it
should
not
be
decided.
we
think
on
this
record
it's
difficult,
particularly
given
the
fact
that
there's
a
separate
grounds
for
affirmance,
there's
a
custom
and
practice
here,
that
regardless
of
lack
of
training
the
custom
and
practice
prong
is
certainly
satisfied.
there's
no
legal
problem
with
that.
it
was
properly
made.
and
that
custom
and
practice--
mr.
david
rudovsky
--justice
o'connor,
just
in
quick
response,
i
think
unrebutted
testimony
of
the
police
officer,
when
the
city
could
have
presented
a
witness
to
rebut
that
testimony,
i
think
under
evidentiary
rules,
should
be
sufficient
to
establish--
mr.
david
rudovsky
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
