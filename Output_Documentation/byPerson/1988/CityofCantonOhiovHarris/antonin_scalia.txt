justice

mr.
phillips,
you
confuse
me
with
saying
that
there
were
two,
two
bases
and
they've
abandoned
the
one.
i
took,
i
took
them
to
be
two
parts
of
a
single
basis
for
the
lower
court's
assessment
of
liability.
that
is
to
say,
the
failure
to
train
would
not
have
been
a
violation
unless
you
are
conferring
discretion
upon
the
people
that
you
fail
to
train.
it
would
be
okay
not
to
train
the
supervisors,
if
it
isn't
ultimately
their
decision,
if
they
have
a
guidebook
that
says
you
do
this,
this,
and
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
maybe
you
shouldn't
have
bought
on
to
gross
indifference
then.
i
don't
know
how
you
can
measure
gross
indifference
without
measuring
the
foreseeability.
i
mean,
whenever
you
say
you're
grossly
indifferent
it
depends
upon
how
certain
it
is
that
something
will
happen
if
you
don't
do
something
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
you
cannot
embrace
gross
indifference
as
a
standard
and
at
the
same
time
reject
foreseeability--
justice
antonin
scalia
did
you
say
this
in
your
opposition
to
the
petition
for
cert?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
also
concerned
about
a
jury
speculating
about
what
is
gross
negligence.
why
shouldn't
we
adopt
a
much
higher
standard,
to
the
extent,
to
the
extent
we
miss
something
as
a
policy,
which
you
think
should
have
been
considered
a
bad
policy,
you
get
the
city
under
a
practice
anyway.
if
indeed
they've
adopted
a
policy
of
not
training
people,
it
is
very
bad,
because
it's
absolutely
foreseeable
that
these
officers
are
not,
are
going
to
be
making
mistakes.
they
will
make
mistakes,
and
you
will
have
a
practice
of
providing
inadequate
medical
care,
which
will
enable
the
city
to
be
held
liable.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
wouldn't
you
inevitably,
if
it's
as
foreseeable
as
you
say
it
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
i'm
a
little
worried
about
having
the
jury
guess
about
that,
whereas
a
practice
you
can
look
out
there
and
say,
here
are
ten
instances
of
adequate,
inadequate
medical
care.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
realistic
hypothetic
you're
giving
us?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
realistic
hypothetical
is
going
to
be
what
happens
here,
that
the
officer
gets
off
and
the
deep
pockets,
the
city,
gets
held
liable.
that's
the
realistic--
justice
antonin
scalia
--your
time's
almost
up.
and
when
you
raised
your
point
about
this,
the
main
issue
that
we're
now
discussing
not
having
been
raised,
i
tended
to
agree
with
you
on
the
manner
in
which
the
question
was
presented
in
the
statement
of
question
presented.
but
i've
been
looking
through
the
petition
itself,
and
there
are
a
number
of
statements
which
it
seems
to
me
do
raise
the
question,
including
the
statement
that
the
fundamental
issue
in
kibbe
is
identical
to
the
issue
presented
here.
and
in
your
reply
to
the
petition,
you
didn't
deny
that,
by
saying,
oh
no,
this
was
all
acknowledged
below.
you
distinguish
kibbe
in
a
quite
different
way,
that
kibbe
involves
un-constitutional
conduct
arising
out
of
gross
negligent
failing,
as
opposed
to
a
regulation
coupled
with
inadequate
training.
you
just
completely
failed
to
make
the
point
you're
making.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
clear
what
issue
was
being
referred
to
in
the
brief.
justice
antonin
scalia
respondent
says
it's
not
fair
to
him.
he
might
have
produced
additional
evidence,
had
he
known
that
the
standard
that
you're
now
contending
before
us
is
the
standard
he
was
going
to
be
held
to.
he
produced
lesser,
or
evidence
to
satisfy
a
lesser
standard
because
you
conceded
the
lesser
standard
in
the
trial.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
evidence
that
was
put
in.
but
he's
saying
i
might
have
put
in
more
if
i--
