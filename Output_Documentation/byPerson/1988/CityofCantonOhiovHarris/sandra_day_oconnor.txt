mr.
phillips,
in
the
posture
that
we
have
to
consider
the
case,
are
we
concerned
only
with
the
liability
of
the
city?
and
do
we
take
it
as
a
given
that
the
jail
supervisor
violated
this
woman's
constitutional
rights?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we,
we
assume,
for
purposes
of
deciding
this,
that
there
was
some
deliberate
indifference
and
a
violation
of
her
constitutional
rights.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can
a
failure
on
the
part
of
the
city
to
adequately
train
its
personnel
ever
amount
to
a
violation
of
the
constitution,
mr.
phillips?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
here
there
was
a
clear
policy
that
the
city
had
adopted,
to
the
effect
that
if
someone
in
these
circumstances
needs
medical
attention
they're
to
take
them
to
the
hospital.
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
what
do
we
have
left?
a
custom?
i
mean,
what
are
we
dealing
with
on
the
city's
liability?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
the
sense
of
a
custom,
or
a
practice?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
haven't
they,
haven't
they
at
least
preserved
the
question
of
whether
inadequate
training
can
ever
be
a
policy
or
a
custom
for
purposes
of
monell?
haven't
they
raised
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
question
on
cert
is
whether
inadequate
training
can
be
found
to
be
a
policy
or
a
custom
within
the
meaning
of
monell.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
it
seems
to
me
they
raised
it
here
and
that
we
can
answer
that
question.
can't
we?
you,
you
should
have
raised
that
in
your
motion
in
opposition.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--what
constitutional
right
do
you
say
was
violated
by--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
think
that
that
certainly
is
open
to
question,
because
the
testimony
of
the
one
police
officer
may
well
not
suffice
to
meet
that
standard.
