mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
canton,
ohio
is
a
relatively
small
city
in
the
northeastern
part
of
the
state
of
ohio
whose
fame
heretofore
has
been
based
largely
on
william
mckinley
and
the
professional
football
hall
of
fame.
unfortunately,
unfortunately
today
we
have
a
new
reason
for
fame,
you're
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
is
before
this
court
because
the
sixth
circuit
has
ordered
it
to
face
a
new
trial
under
42
usc
section
1983
for
failure
to
provide
adequate
medical
care
to
a
detainee
in
the
city's
jails.
the
legal
issue
in
this
case,
one
this
court
has
confronted
somewhat
often
in
recent
years,
is
under
what
circumstances
the
city
is
liable
for
the
constitution
torts
committed
by
its
employees?
the
case
arises
out
of
the
arrest
of
the
respondent,
mrs.
geraldine
harris,
on
april
26th,
1978.
mrs.
harris
was
stopped
for
speeding
by
a
canton
police
officer.
there
is
no
question
that
the
stop
at
that
time
was
a
perfectly
lawful
act
by
the
city.
apparently
upset
by
her
sense
that
others
around
her
were
also
speeding,
she
became
quite
agitated
and
refused
to
provide
the
police
officer
with
information
necessary
to
allow
him
to
fill
out
his
ticket.
consistent
with
the
standard
practice
in
the
state
of
ohio
and
the
city
of
canton
at
the
time,
the
officer
decided
that
the
best
response
was
to
place
mrs.
harris
under
arrest
and
to
have
her
transported
to
the
police
station
in
the
hopes
that
she
might
calm
down
and
provide
the
officers
with
the
necessary
information.
and
there's
never
been
any
challenge
to
the
lawfulness
of
the
city's
action
in
having
mrs.
harris
brought
to
the
police
station
at
that
time.
mrs.
harris
became
quite
agitated,
as
a
consequence
of
this
decision,
and
apparently
became
unable
to
walk
without
assistance.
she
was
therefore
assisted
by
two
police
officers
into
a
patrol
wagon
and
taken
to
the
police
station.
at
the
station
mrs.
harris
was
asked
about
her
medical
condition,
whether
she
had
a
medical
condition,
whether
she
needed
any
medicine.
and
her
response
to
that
question,
as
well
as
all
other
questions
that
were
provided
to
mrs.
harris,
was
that
she
wanted
to
see
her
son,
ronny,
and
she
wanted
to
see
him
immediately.
the
reason
mrs.
harris
was
asked
that
question
is
that
the
city
of
canton
has
a
specific
written
policy
which
provides
that
the
officer
who's
assigned
as
the
jailer
"shall
when
a
prisoner
is
found
unconscious
or
semi-conscious
or
when
he
or
she
is
unable
to
explain
his
or
her
condition,
or
who
complains
of
being
ill,
has
such
person
taken
to
a
hospital
for
medical
treatment,
with
the
permission
of
a
supervisor
before
admitting
a
person
to
the
city
jail.
"
although
mrs.
harris'
behavior
was
extreme
under
the
circumstances,
the
testimony
is
undisputed
that
it
was
not
uncommon
for
inmates
to
become
hysterical
as
a
consequence
of
being
brought
to
the
police
station,
especially
if
they'd
never
been
there
previously.
for
that
reason
the
decision
was
made
that
the
best
course
of
action
was
simply
to
try
to
find
mrs.
harris'
son
and
have
him
brought
to
the
police
station
as
quickly
as
possible.
because
mrs.
harris
refused
to
sit
in
a
seat
in
the
police
station
at
the
time,
or
was
unable
to...
it's
not
clear
exactly
what
the
circumstances
were...
she
was
placed
into
a
cell
until
her
son
was
able
to
arrive
within
20
to
30
minutes
and
to
arrange
for
mrs.
harris'
release.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
there
is
a
direct
testimony
on
a
number
of
instances
that
the
immediate
question
was,
did
she
require
medical
assistance
and
was
she
ill?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
they
asked
her
that
to
see
whether
that,
which
is
one
of
the
things
that
you're
supposed
to
do
under
regulations.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
they
could
take
her
to
the
hospital.
of
course,
they
could
not
require
her
to
submit
to
the
medical
treatment
without
her
consent.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
they
could
not
require
her
to
submit
to
medical
treatment
without
her
consent.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
they
could
have
taken
her
to
the
hospital
but
there
was
testimony
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--it
might
have
found
out
that
there
was
a
mistake,
justice
marshall--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
it
was
thought
of,
justice
marshall,
and
there
was
testimony
in
the
record
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i'm
trying
to--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--they
couldn't
have
taken
her
without
her
consent
because
she
was
in
custody.
but
there
are
two
parts
to
the
answer
to
your
question,
justice
marshall.
the
first
part
is
that
their
first
reaction
was
to
ask
her
whether
she
needed
medical
assistance.
the
second
part
of
the
answer
was
that
there
was
testimony
from
the
head
jailer
that
if
mrs.
harris
was
likely
to
remain
in
the
jail
for
much
longer
he
was,
he
was
at
a
point
in
time
where
he
was
thinking
about
sending
her
to
the
hospital.
but
he
believed
that
her
son
would
be
coming
almost
immediately.
so
it
wasn't
even
in
this
case
a
situation
where
somebody
said,
i'm
going
to
completely
ignore
mrs.
harris'
condition.
they
took
into
account
the
possibility
of
sending
her
to
the
hospital,
and
decided
that
under
the
regulation,
and
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
the
better
course
of
action
was
to
allow
her
to
remain
there
until
her
son
was
able
to
arrive.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
in
the
posture
of
this
case,
we
have
to
assume
that
there
was
deliberate
indifference
by
someone.
the
testimony
that
i
cited
didn't
happen
to
be
the
supervisor,
it
happened
to
be
that
of
the
head
jailer.
there
was
a
supervisor
who
was
not
sued
in
this
specific
case.
but
in
the
posture
of
the
case,
you're
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
correct.
that's
accepted
for
purposes
of
this
argument,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
would
say
it
is
counter-intuitive,
and
as
the
plurality
opinion
indicated
in
oklahoma
city,
almost
difficult
to
accept
as
a
submission
that
someone
has
a
policy
of
inadequate
training.
and
so
i
would
think
it
almost
inconceivable
that
a
policy
of
inadequate
training
exists
in
a
way
that
would
make
it--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that's
absolutely
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
respondents...
it
depends
on
who
you
ask
and
at
what
point
in
time,
i
suspect.
if
you
ask
the
sixth
circuit
what
we're
dealing
with
here,
the
sixth
circuit
identifies
the
policy
as
delegating
discretion
to
police
officers
without
providing
adequate
training.
now
respondents
in
this
court
don't
really
defend
the
sixth
circuit's
policy,
the
policy
it
recognized,
the
delegating
discretion,
i
think
in
large
measure
because
of
this
court's
decision
last
term
in
praprotnik.
respondents
now
are
saying
that
there
is
a
"policy
of
inadequate
training"
that
has
given
rise
in
some
respect
to
the
injury
in
the
particular
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
they
also
argue
in
the
alternative
that
there
is
a
custom
at
issue
in
this
case.
as
we
suggest
in
our
brief
that
it's
not
clear,
frankly,
that
the
issue
of
custom
has
been
preserved
up
to
this
point.
the
sixth
circuit
certainly
did
not
hold
that
there
was
any
kind
of
a
custom
in
this
case,
and
we
would
submit
that
there
is
certainly
no
evidence
from
which
one
could
infer
the
existence
of
a
custom.
respondents'
only
evidence
on
the
issue
of
custom
is
a
single
statement
by
a
single
police
officer,
not
a
policymaker,
that
he
personally
in
situations
of
dealing
with
emotionally-disturbed
would
wait
until
the
person
appeared
to
be
a
threat
to
herself,
him
or
herself,
before
he
would
be
obliged
to
take
that
person
to
the
hospital.
that
is
the
only
evidence.
there
is
no
indication
in
the
record
of
this
case
of
anyone
ever
being
denied
medical
care,
either
for
emotional
or
medical
or
physical
injuries.
indeed,
the
testimony
of
the
chief
of
police
in
office
in
1978
when
the
incident
took
place
was
that
he
had
never
even
been,
he
had
never
received
even
a
complaint
about
a
failure
to
provide
medical
assistance
in
this
case.
under
those
circumstances,
i
don't
think
there's
any
basis
frankly
for
saying
that
there
is
such
a
subtle
custom
of
depriving
people
of
medical
care
within
the
community,
that
it
could
be
regarded
as
law
for
the
city
of
canton.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
personally,
i
would
have
been
in
a
position
to
argue
that
a
directed,
i
would
have
argued
that
a
directed
verdict
was
appropriate
in
this
case,
frankly.
but
we
didn't,
we
didn't
win
that,
and
we
didn't
preserve
it
on
appeal,
and
therefore
we
had
to
take
it
as
a
given
that
there
was
deliberate
indifference.
but
if
you
ask
me
for
a
personal
judgment
on
the
record,
i'd
say
no,
there
is
no
evidence.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
she
testified
to
the
effect
that
she
was
struck,
pushed,
and
the
jury
found
against
her
on
all
of
these
claims.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
so
that
it's
clear
that
there
was,
that
at
least
with
respect
to
the
assessment
of
this
record
in
this
case,
on
all
elements,
save
for
the
provision
of
medical
care,
the
city
has
acted
perfectly
reasonably,
and
in
no
way...
i
mean
the
city
and
all
of
its--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
that
they
were
found
non-liable.
but
i
take
it,
at
least,
it's
going
to
be
difficult
in
a...
i
mean,
the
argument
of
the
defense
at
trial
was
that
none
of
those
acts
were
committed.
it
was
not
so
much
that
they
had
a
qualified
immunity
to
abuse
her.
and,
in
fact,
there
were
common
law
tort
actions
brought,
and
all
of
those
were
rejected,
and
so
there
wouldn't
have
been
a
qualified
immunity
for
those
common
law
tort
actions.
therefore,
i
think
the
inference
is
inescapable
that
what
the
jury
found
was
that
this
woman
was
in
no
way
abused
as
a
consequence
of
her
actions,
and
a
consequence
of
that
particular
arrest.
at
the
end
of
the
trial,
after
mrs.
harris
had
sued
her
arresting
officer,
the
officer
who
is
the
backup
officer,
the
person
who
drove
the
patrol
wagon,
the
assistant
jailer,
the
head
jailer,
the
chief
of
police,
and
the
mayor
of
the
city,
and
including
the
city
of
canton
itself,
the
jury
rejected
all
of
the
findings
against
all
of
the
defendants
except
for
the
one
against
the
city
of
canton.
and
the
one
against
the
city
of
canton
involved
exclusively
the
question
of
whether
the
city
failed
to
provide
her
with
adequate
medical
assistance
during
the
period
of
her
detention.
and
for
that
she
was
awarded
$200,000.
now,
that
award
was
set
aside
by
the
sixth
circuit
because
there
was
clearly
an
improper
instruction
given
to
the
jury
with
respect
to
the
liability
of
the
city.
the
sixth
circuit,
however,
went
ahead
and
remanded
the
case
for
a
new
trial
on
the
basis
that
liability
could
properly
be
found
in
this
case
"on
the
fact
that
the
police
had
an
established
policy
of
allowing
shift
commanders
unfettered
discretion
to
make
the
decision
to
refer
a
prisoner
to
the
hospital
based
on
their
personal
judgment
and
perception
coupled
with
the
fact
that
these
commanders
were
given
no
training
or
guidelines
for
making
this
decision.
"
it
is
that
holding
which
is
at
issue
in
this
case,
although
as
i
indicated
a
moment
ago
respondents
essentially
have
abandoned
defense
of
that
specific
holding.
they
do
not
argue
that
the
policy
of
conferring
the
discretion
is
the
1983.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
city
objected
to
that,
justice
stevens.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
we
objected
to
the
instruction
as
given,
as
a
glorified
version
of
respondeat
superior.
so
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
that
we
preserve
the
jury
instruction
issue
in
this
case.
looking
at
the
holding
of
the
sixth
circuit,
vis-a-vis
this
court's
decisions
in
monell
and
its
progeny
interpreting--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--42
usc
section
1983--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--the
basis
for
my
inference
about
the
submission
of
the
respondents...
obviously
i'd
be
in
a
better
position
to
clarify
that
point...
is
that
if
you
look
at
the
specific
evidence
that
they
identify
on
the
issue
of
whether
there
was
a
policy
within
the
meaning
of
monell
that
could
give
rise
to
liability
here,
they
don't
say
anything
about
conferring
discretion
at
that
point.
the
only
evidence
they
turn
to
was
the
evidence
of
the
chief
of
police,
although
i
should
note
that
that
was
the
chief
of
police
in
1980
as
opposed
to
1978
when
the
events
took
place,
but
his
evidence
to
the
effect
that
they
did
not
have
additional
training
or
any
specific
training
with
respect
to
emotional
injuries.
i
inferred
from
that
they
are
not
really
supporting
particularly
the
specific
basis
of
the
court,
and
i
assumed
that
on
the
basis
of
what
this
court
said
in
praprotnik
that
you
cannot
identify
as
an
actionable
policy
under
1983
the
decision
to
confer
discretion
upon
employees.
so
they've
now
gone
in
search
of
a
new
policy,
and
that
policy
they
style
as
inadequate
training.
again,
i
say
respondents
are
certainly
in
a
position
to
argue
to
the
contrary.
my
position
here
would
be,
take
it
as
either
the
conferring
of
discretion
or
inadequate
training,
it
doesn't
get
you
any
further
than
the
policy
of
inadequate
training
in
any
event,
since
conferring
discretion
is
a
necessary
function.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
you
mean,
can,
the
conferring
of
discretion
on
someone
who's
not
trained?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
that
the
problem
with
analyzing
it
that
way,
justice
stevens,
is
that
the
1983
isn't
concerned
with,
with
who
makes
decisions,
or
even
how
well
trained
those
individuals
are.
section
1983
is
concerned
with
whether
there's
been
a
violation
of
someone's
constitutional
rights,
and
under
what
circumstances
the
city
should
be
responsible.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
see,
i
think
the
flaw,
i
mean
the
problem
in
that
hypothetical
is
not
the
conferring
of
discretion.
it
is
what
ultimately
is
the
clear
inference
that
the
policy
of
the
city
is
to
act
in
deliberate
disregard
of
the
individual's
constitutional
rights.
and
so
i
think
to
look
at
what
the
basis
for
the
decision
on
training
and
the
conferring
of
discretion
does
is
take
you
away
from
looking
at
the
real
issue
in
the
case,
and
that
is
has
the
city's
fathers
or
the
policymakers
of
the
city
decided
that
we
don't
care
about
the
constitutional
rights
of
individual
citizens
within
our
community.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
now,
it
may
well
be
that
the
action
is
evidence
of
that
kind
of
a
policy,
but
the
hypothetical
you
pose
is
certainly
a
very
extreme
one.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
that's
an
inappropriate
policy
to
examine.
i
think
what
you
say
is
that
that
is
a
policy
of
manifest
indifference,
deliberate
indifference
to
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
citizens,
that
the
assumption
underlying
a
process
by
which
you
decide
to
put
those
people
out
on
the
streets
is
that
they
will
in
fact
violate
constitutional
rights.
and
when
they
do
in
fact
violate
constitutional
rights
that
that's
really
taken
pursuant
to
the
authorization
inherent
in
what
the,
in
what
the
policymakers
did.
i
think
that's
a
better
way
to
analyze
that
question
than
to
focus
on
the
issue
of
whether
the
policy
of
inadequate
training
and
policy
of
conferring
discretion
are
problematic
in
a
particular
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think...
i
think
that
you
might
find
a
circumstance
where
you
could
infer
from
that
deliberate
indifference.
my
basic
position
here
is,
is
that,
justice
stevens,
the
hypothetical
you
pose
is
not
a
realistic
one,
for
the
simple
reason
that
no
community
is
going
to
go
out
and
seek
to
find
the
lowest
common
denominator
person
to
protect
them.
the
average
citizens
of
the
community
are
not
going
to
accept
that
kind
of
situation.
and
therefore
you're
just
not
going
to
have
the
situation
where
you
free
up
the
prisons
and
make
them,
police
officers--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
a
specific
instance
of
an
untrained
police
officer
being
given
responsibility
seems
to
me
an
inappropriate
basis
for
inferring
that
the
city
has
a
policy
of
deliberate
indifference
toward
constitutional
rights.
and
that's
why
i
get
back
to
the
point
that
that's
the
reason
you
have
to
analyze
it
in
terms
of
the
city's
policy
with
respect
to
the
violation
of
constitutional
rights,
because
the
hypothetical
you
pose
is
never
going
to
happen
in
real
life.
and
it
seems
to
me
inappropriate
to
focus
on
inadequate
training
and
conferring
of
discretion,
which
are
absolutely
unquestioned
appropriate
decisions
by
policymakers
to
deal
with
a
one
in
a
billion
likelihood
that
somebody
would
act
in
the
way
that
you've
described.
it
seems
to
me
it's
much
more
sensible
to
analyze
the
case
across
the
generality
of
situations
and
to
focus
on
the
protection
of
the
constitutional
rights
themselves,
rather
than
trying
to
make
section
1983
into
a
statute
designed
to
provide
uniform
training
for
all
municipalities
and
counties
throughout
the
united
states,
which
i
think
there's
no
evidence
that
1983
was
ever
intended
to
be.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
i
think
that
that
could
be
described
as
a
policy,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
from
failure
to
act
by
whom?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
by
the
city
policymakers?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it's
difficult
to
answer
that
in
the
abstract.
my
assumption
is
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--it
wouldn't
in
a
single
incident...
i'm
sorry,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
you
wouldn't...
i
don't
think
you
can
find
that
from
a
single
incident.
for
instance
in
this
case,
did
the
city
act
to
provide
additional
training
for
medical
determinations?
no,
it
didn't.
so
you
could
say
there's
a
failure
to
act.
does
that
give
rise
to
an
inference
of
a
policy
of
deliberate
indifference
to
specific
medical
concerns?
i
think
absolutely
not.
there's
no
basis
for
that.
the
only
time
failure
to
act
can
begin
to
have
any
significant
meaning
in
this
context
is
in
the
face
of
obvious
instances
of
problems.
and
then
you
have
a
failure
to
act,
and
the
failure
to
act
gives
rise
to
an
inference
that
there's
a
deliberate
indifference
to
the
rights--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
think--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--justice
kennedy,
i'm
sort
of
reminded
of
the
old
television
program,
mayberry
r.f.d.,
or
whatever,
where
the,
where
you
have
a
single
sheriff
and
he
has
a
gun,
and
the
question
is,
is
the
city
under
all
circumstances
required
to
provide
a
certain
minimum
amount
of
400
hours
of
training
in
that
kind
of
a
situation,
where
there's
no
reason
in
the
world
to
believe
that
the
person's
ever
going
to
need
to
use
that
gun,
there
has
never
been
any
instance
where
a
gun
has
ever
been
drawn
in
the
past.
and
i
don't
think
that...
i
think
the
problem
with
looking
at
this
as
a
training
case
is
that
what
you're
saying
is
that
every
community
has
to
face
up
to
this
problem
and
provide
a
certain
amount
of
training,
even
when
it
isn't...
it
may
be
foreseeable
in
the
abstract
sense,
but
it's
very
unlikely.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
that
that,
that
the
foreseeability
standard
is
an
inappropriate
one
under
section
1983.
you're
talking
about
the
policies
of
the
city--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--without
reference
to
what
city
it
is.
i
think
you
have
to
have
a
different
causal
link
between
the
policy
of
the
city
that
you
identify
and
the
injury
that
ultimately
arises
out
of
that.
the
court
said
in
praprotnik
last
term
that
you
cannot
use
simple
proximate
cause
standards
when
you're
dealing
with
section
1983.
there's
got
to
be
something
more.
you
have
to
find
that
it
is
pursuant
to,
that
it
is
the
moving
force,
that
it
an
affirmative
link.
and
i
don't
think
that
foreseeability
is
a
sufficient
standard
to
satisfy
all
of
those,
to
satisfy
any
of
those
descriptions
of
what
causation
is
required
under
section
1983.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
i...
justice--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
think
that
you
can
reject
mere
foreseeability
as
tantamount
to
gross
indifference.
if
it
is
unforeseeable
it
clearly
isn't
grossly
indifferent.
but
i
don't
think
it
follows
that
simply
because
something
is
foreseeable
and
you
don't
take
action
in
response
to
that,
that
you
act
with
gross
indifference.
i'll
go
back
to
my
hypothetical
involving
a
small
community
that
has
a
single
sheriff.
in
that
situation
it
certainly
may
be
foreseeable
that
some
incident
will
arise
in
a
local
high
school
where
the
police
officer
suddenly
pulls
out
his
gun
and
starts
to
shoot.
that
may
happen.
but
what
i
submit
to
you
is
that
400
hours
of
training
and
the
refusal
to
provide
that
to
that
police
officer
is
not
a
gross
indifference
to
the
constitutional
rights
of
those
high
school
students.
no
one
anticipated
that
that
would
happen.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
was
merely
going
along
with
justice
scalia
on
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
my
preference
frankly--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--can
i
just
finish?
my
preference,
frankly,
is
deliberate
indifference,
because
i
think
it
even
connotes
more
than
simply
recklessness.
i
think
what
it
connotes
is
some
kind
of
volition,
and
i
think
that's
terrible
important
in
situations
where
you're
trying
to
hold
the
city
liable.
prosser
and
keaton,
in
their
analysis
of
gross
negligence
and
reckless
indifference
and
deliberate
indifference,
say
that
gross
negligence
and
recklessness
all
tend
to
shade
toward
the
negligence
side
based
on
conduct.
deliberate
indifference
is
a
standard
that
tends
to
provide
a
certain
amount
of
volition,
which
i
think
is
again
a
central
element
of
what
should
be
required
as
part
of
the
policy
prong
under
monell.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
think
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
white,
i'd
like
to,
i'd
like
to
respond
to
the
last
statement
that
you
made
to
counsel.
if
this
court
concludes
that
there
is
no
evidence
from
which
a
policy
as
a
basis
for
liability
under
1983
exists,
there
is
no
reason
for
a
new
trial
in
this
case.
at
a
minimum,
one
of
the
things
this
court
is
obliged
to
do
at
this
stage
is
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
standards
employed
by
the
sixth
circuit
are
an
appropriate
basis
for
a
new
trial,
and
we
say
that's
clearly
wrong,
and
i
don't
still
hear
respondents'
counsel
to
defend
the
standards
employed
by
the
sixth
circuit
in
this
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice
scalia,
the
truth
is
that
the
evidence
in
this
case
doesn't
meet
any
standard
with
respect
to
the
city.
you
can
use
simple
negligence,
and
there's
not
enough
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
even,
even
in
the
worst
of
circumstances,
he
knew
he
was
obliged
to
put
in
enough
evidence
to
demonstrate
that
the
city
was
negligent.
and
he
hasn't
even
done
that.
so
he's
hardly
in
a
position
to
say
here
that
we've
sandbagged
him
with
respect
to
the
evidence
he
wants
to
put
in
on
the
issue
of
a
policy
in
this
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
and
we
believe...
but
the
standard
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes.
that's
absolutely
correct.
the
district
court's
not
in
any
position
to
do
anything
different
other
than
say
that
it
thinks
that
the
standard
of
the
sixth
circuit--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that's
correct.
i
still
don't
think
i've
heard
him
defend
that
standard,
and
all
i'm
saying
is
that
under
any
standard
there's
no
basis
for
going
back
for
a
trial
in
this
case.
because
if
you
examine
the
custom,
or
excuse
me,
the
policy
issue
in
this
case,
there's
one,
no
issue
that
any
policymaker
ever,
ever
made
a
decision
with
respect
to
the
adequacy
of
training
in
this
case.
the
chief
of
police
that
he
cites
was
the
chief
of
police
in
1980,
not
in
1978
when
the
events
took
place.
second
of
all,
there's
no
deliberate
choice
among
alternatives
in
this
case,
because
there's
no
evidence
whatsoever
of
what
alternative
levels
of
training
could
possibly
have
been
adequate
in
this
case.
and
finally,
there
is
no
evidence
on
the
issue
of
causation.
there's
not
a
single
expert
testify
as
to
what
level
of
training
would
have
been
satisfactory
to
stop
mrs.
harris
from
suffering
the
injuries
she
suffered,
and
i
submit
to
you
that
a
physician
in
this
particular
case
could
well
have
made
exactly
the
same
mistake
that
the
officers
made.
one
last
point
on
the
issue
of
custom.
counsel
cites
the
testimony
of
mr.
norsia
and
says
it
was
uncontradicted.
the
testimony
he
cites
from
the
captain,
the
ship's
commander
on
the
issue,
was,
what
things
are
done
with
a
very
emotional
hysterical
type
person,
captain
maxson
stated,
they
generally
cool
off
on
their
own,
but
if
the
situation
persists
we
take
them
to
the
hospital.
i
submit
there's
no
evidence
in
this
case
of
a
custom
of
violating
constitutional
rights,
and
therefore
the
judgment
below
should
be
set
aside.
thank
you.
