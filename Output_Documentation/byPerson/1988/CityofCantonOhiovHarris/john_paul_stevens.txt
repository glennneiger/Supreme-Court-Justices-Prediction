mr.
phillips,
just,
the
portion
of
the
instruction
that
the
sixth
circuit
felt
was
proper,
not
the
part
that
reversed
that,
who
submitted
that?
did
you
agree
to
that,
the
city?
or
did
the
city
object
to
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
did.
i
know
they
submitted
a
different
one.
but
they
also
objected
to
one--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--excuse
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
pursue
that
just
a
second.
would
you
say
that
it
would
never
violate,
be
a
policy
of
a
city
conferred
discretion
to
make
arrests
and
interrogate
people,
do
everything
the
police
do
on
a
person
who
was
totally
untrained?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
that,
could
that
constitute
a
policy
that
would
be
actionable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
of
course,
you
have
to
assume,
i
mean
to
take
it
a
step
further,
that
if
one
calls
it
a
policy,
that
the
policy
is
one
that
foreseeably
led
to
the
violation
of
someone's
constitutional
rights.
for
example,
if
you
took
a
bunch
of
ex-convicts
and
said,
we'll
make
you
the
police
officers
from
now
on,
it
might
be
fairly
predictable
that
somebody's
rights
would
be
violated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
what
if
the
policy
was
to
save
money,
they
don't
want
to
spend
unnecessary
money,
and
they
hire
the
lowest-paid
police
officers
they
could
find,
who
happened
also
to
have
no
training
in
areas
that
police
officers
are
normally
trained
in?
could
that...
and
then
say
they
predictably,
a
constitutional
violation
ensues.
could
you
say,
could
you
characterize
that
as
a
policy
of
giving
discretion
to
people
who
are
not
trained
to
carry
out
their
duties?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
reason
you
say
it
would
be
a
violation
is
because
it
is
so
clearly
foreseeable
that
constitutional
violations
would
result,
as
i
understood
your
response.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
perhaps
my
example
is
an
extreme
one.
but
i
don't
think
it's
totally
implausible
to
suggest
that
there
are
in
fact,
there
have
in
fact
been
untrained
police
officers
who've
been
given
such
responsibilities.
