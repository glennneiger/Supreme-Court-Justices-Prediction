chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
86-1088,
the
city
of
canton
v.
geraldine
harris.
mr.
phillips,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
agree,
mr.
phillips,
that
if
the
city
officials
take
steps
or
act
in
a
way
that
would
support
an
inference
of
deliberate
indifference
to
people's
constitutional
rights,
that
could
be
described
as
a
policy
under
monell?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
phillips,
my
question
earlier
was
deliberate
indifference.
now,
maybe
there's,
it's
fine
shades
of
nuance
between
gross
indifference
and
deliberate
indifference.
deliberate
always
to
me
has
connoted
an
element
of
recklessness,
that
comes
closer
to
intent
than
what
might
be...
i've
never
heard
the
term
"gross
indifference"
used
up
till
now.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
no
choice.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whatever.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
mr.
rudovsky,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rudovsky,
did
you
make
this
point
in
your
brief
in
opposition
to
certiorari?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
agree,
mr.
rudovsky,
that
the
questions
actually
presented
and
worded
in
the
petition
are
properly
before
the
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
do
you
think
at
least
the
questions
presented
in
the,
as
worded
in
the
petition...
i
know
that
the
wording
is
somewhat
different
in
the
brief...
are
properly
before
the
court?
because,
your
motion,
your
brief
in
opposition
did
not
raise
any
question
about
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
that
by
itself
supposed
to
be
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
treating
mentally
disturbed
people
differently
than
physically--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you,
you
pick
gross
negligence
from
our
cases,
or
from
the
statute,
or
just
because
you
think
it
would
be
a
good
idea?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
justice
o'connor
and
i
were
given
a
case
in
law
school,
which...
that
defined
gross
negligence
as
the
absence
of
even
that
care
which
careless
people
exercise.
that
always
struck
me
as
a
rather
unsatisfactory
concept.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rudovsky.
mr.
phillips,
you
have
six
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
white.
