justice

by
the
city.
justice
byron
r.

yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
should
dismiss
as
improperly
granted?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
other
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
rule
you're
talking
about,
is
it
just
a
rule
of
the
court
that
we
normally
don't
hear
cases
that...
hear
issues
that
weren't
presented
below?
justice
byron
r.
white
--if
that
was
the
custom,
i
suppose
it
was
based
on
a
notion
that
people
who
are
just
emotionally,
sort
of
emotionally
disturbed,
they
don't
need
medical
care.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that...
that
must
have
been
the
opinion.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
the
wrong
standard
in
mind,
the
case
will
be
retried
on
the
wrong
standard.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
it
was
wrong?
that's
part
of
the
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there's
going
to
be
a
new
trial
in
this
case
no
matter
what
we
decide.
and
the
question
is
on
what
rules
of
law
is
it
going
to
be
retried.
justice
byron
r.
white
--both
of
you,
i
take
it,
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
on
its
standard.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
the
question
is,
if
we
just
dismiss
as
improperly
granted
an
admittedly
wrong
decision,
the
court
of
appeals
is
going
to
govern
in
a
new
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
just
said
that
you
haven't
heard
your
opponent
defend
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
first
of
these
is
number
86-1088
city
of
canton
against
harris,
and
for
the
reason
stated
in
an
opinion
in
own
filed
with
the
clerk,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
is
vacated
and
remanded.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
o?connor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
justices
scalia
and
kennedy
have
joined.
