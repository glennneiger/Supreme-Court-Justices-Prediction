going
back
just
one
step,
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
from
which
a
tryer
of
fact
could
infer
deliberate
indifference
on
the
part
of
the
individual
officers?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
again
backing
up
just
one
moment,
is
there
any
evidence
that
the
woman
was
abused?
was
she
struck
or
pushed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
were
there
special
findings,
special
verdicts?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
we
infer
that
just
because
the
officers
were
found
non-liable?
or
were
there
specific
findings
that
the
woman
was
not
mistreated?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
infer
that
policy
from
failure
to
act?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
about
justice
stevens'
test
of
what's
reasonably
foreseeable?
suppose
guns
are
issued
and
the
city
for
budgetary
reasons
just
doesn't
give
its
officers,
new
officers
training
in
the
use
of
firearms?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
shows
them
where
the
safety
is
and
where
the
holster
is,
and
that's
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
with
a
particular
community,
it's
reasonably
foreseeable
that
lack
of
training
would
lead
to
serious
violations
of
constitutional
rights?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
without
reference
to
what
city
it
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
your
view,
is
there
a
difference
in
a
custom
and
a
policy?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why
is
that
any
different
than
a
policy?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
in
this
case
it
is
a
policy?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
every
hotel
in
the
country
has
the
duty
to
give
that
training
to
hotel
desk
clerks?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--do
you
think
they're
negligent
under
state
law
if
they
don't
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
hotel
desk
clerks.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
think
police
officers,
in
addition
to
all
their
law
enforcement
duties,
have
to
have
more
training
than
hotel
desk
clerks
so
far
as
admitting
people
for
a
half-hour
booking,
hour
booking?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
it
was
40
minutes.
