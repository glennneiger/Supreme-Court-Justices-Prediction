justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
suppose
you
could
say
the
tenth
amendment
gives
the
state
of
nevada
a
vested
interest,
too.
i
mean,
does
the
tribe
have
any
more
interest
in
the
ability
to
apply
its
laws
by
virtue
of
this
statute
than
the
states
do
by
virtue
of...
of
our
constitutional
structure?
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
go
back
earlier
and
suppose
that
the
tribal
court
had
had
jurisdiction
at
the
outset,
and
the...
and
the
mother
and
the...
and
the
putative
father
both
expressed
their
desire
that
this
child
be
adopted
by
these
same
people
who
are
not
indians
and
off
the
reservation.
could
the
tribal
court
say
we
will
not
allow
that
adoption
simply
because
these
people
are
not
indians
and
the
child
will
not
be
brought
up
off
the
reservation...
will
not
be
brought
up
on
the
reservation?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
those
the
mother
wants
the
child...
the
mother
says
i've
lived
on
the
reservation.
i
know
what's
it
like.
i
don't
want
my
child
to...
to
be
brought
up
on
the
reservation.
i
would
like
him
to
be
adopted
by
people
off
the
reservation.
can
the
tribal
court
over
rule
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if...
if
you
could
find
indians
on
the
reservation
who
were
willing
to
adopt
the
child,
they
would
have
to
say
that
they
must
adopt
the
child,
despite
the
wishes
of
the
child's
parents?
well,
doesn't
the
statute
require
that?
the
statute
says
that
preference
must
be
given
to
a
member
of
the
indian
child's
extended
family
or
a...
an
indian
foster
home
or
institution
in
preference
to
a
private
placement
off
the
reservation
with
non-indians?
isn't
that
what
the
statute
says?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
mr.
miller,
whether
you're
under
this...
this
indian
law
or
not,
whether
you're
an
indian
or
not,
it's...
it's
simply
not
the
case
that
if
you
choose
not
to
keep
a
child
yourself,
you
have
the
right
to
place
that
child
where
you
like.
i
mean,
it
is...
when
you
decide
you
want
the
child
adopted,
the
state
can
say
where
that
adoption
will
be,
can
it
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
the
statute
clearly
says
that
with...
with
respect
to...
with
respect
to
a
married
couple
on
the
indian
reservation,
for
example,
even
if
they
had
a
child
off
the
reservation,
there
is
no
doubt
where
the
child's
domicile
would
be.
on
would
that
be
an
abandonment
too?
could
you...
could
a
married
indian
couple
put
up...
decide
they
will
have
the
child
off
the
reservation
and
offer
it
to
parents
off
the
reservation
and
say
we're
abandoning
the
child?
i
suppose--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
would
put
a
big
hole
in
the
statute,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
same
situation
as
we
have
here
except
that
the
indian
couple
are
married,
as
opposed
to
what
was
the
case
here
that
they
were
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wouldn't
change
it.
i
agree.
justice
antonin
scalia
they...
they
don't
trump
the...
the
requirement
as
to
which
courts
have
jurisdiction.
as
i
understand
them,
they
apply
even
when
the
state
court
has
proper
jurisdiction.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
asserting
that...
that
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you're
just
pointing
out
that
there
are
protections
for
the...
for
the
indians--
justice
antonin
scalia
where?
it
says
termination
of
parental
rights...
oh,
it
does
say
"or
adoptive
placement
of".
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
whereas
1911
does
use
termination
of
parental
rights
but
not
adoptive
placement,
just
foster
care
placement.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
mess.
