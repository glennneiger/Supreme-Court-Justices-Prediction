john
paul
stevens
wasn't
it
between
january
28
and
march
31
or
the
two
months?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
would
be
a
problem
i
suppose.
you're
making...
making
a
jurisdictional
argument
basically
that
that
court
had
no
jurisdiction.
and
i
know
the
tribe
acted
very
promptly
here.
but
supposing
the
children
were
15
years
old,
they
could
still
come
in
and
challenge
the
adoption
under
your
theory.
there's
no
waiver
of
a
jurisdictional
claim
like
this.
i
mean,
that...
that's
a
tough
rule
if
you
have
to
apply
it
that
far.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
think
that's
where
your
theory
takes
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but...
say
the
tribe
didn't
find
out
about
this
until...
the
child
apparently
was
not
born
to
married
parents.
it
was
an
unusual
situation.
say
the
tribe
found
out
about
it
after
the
child
was
three
or
four
years
old.
they
could
still
have...
the
tribe
would
have
exactly
the
same
interest.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
think
congress
probably
intended
that,
well,
that's
just
one
of
those
tough
situations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
no,
it's
not
what
the
tribe
abandons,
but
your
position
is
the
court...
the
mississippi
court
simply
had
no
power
to
act.
so,
that...
that
decree
is
basically
a
nullity
because
the
federal
statute
says
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
right
resides
with
the
tribe.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
think
it's
appropriate
to
predict
what
they
might
do.
the
only
question
is
the
tribal
court
clearly
would
have
the
power
to
say
we
do
not...
we
are
not
going
to
permit
this
child
to
be
placed
in
a
non-indian
family.
it
clearly
would
have
that
power.
it
might
decide
not
to
do
it,
but
it's
clear
that
the...
the
mere
fact
that
the
natural
parents
want
the
child
adopted
by
a
non-indian
couple
in
gulfport
doesn't
mean
that
they
will
have
their
wishes
prevail
in
the
tribal
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
miller,
can
i
go
back
a
minute
to
the
relationship
between
1911
and
1913?
justice
john
paul
stevens
nineteen
eleven
relates
to
child
custody
proceedings.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
was
one
of
the
arguments
you
make
that
this
is
not
a
child
custody
proceeding?
the
child
custody
proceeding
is
generally
ancillary
to
a
divorce
or
something
of
that
kind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
not...
this
is
not
involuntary.
this,
of
course,
is
a
voluntary--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so,
you're...
what
you're
saying
is
that
1913
is
the
governing
statute
in
this
case--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--which
is
quite
a
different
theory
than
the
mississippi
court.
and...
and
1913
by
its
terms
really
assumes
that
there
will
state...
be
state
court
jurisdiction
of
some
of
these
cases,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
if
it's
a...
if
it's
an
adoption
proceeding,
it
cannot...
you
cannot
read
1911
as
having
exclusive
jurisdiction...
the
tribe
having
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
all
cases
or
else
you'd
have
no
room
for
1913
to
operate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
only
in
state
court
child
custody
proceedings,
not
necessarily
adoption
proceedings.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
suppose
that's
what
we're
here
to
decide.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
a
federal
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
they're
very
similar.
but
1913,
as
i
read
it,
certainly
contemplates
that
there
would
be
some
adoption
proceedings
over
which
a
state
court
would
have
jurisdiction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
unless
one
reads
1913
as
applying
only
to
indians
who
don't
live
on
reservations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
don't
think
that's
a
natural
reading
of
that
section.
