well,
how
long
after
the
adoption
decree
was
issued
by
the
trial
court
did
the
tribe
intervene?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
indian
tribal
court
have
the
authority
to
grant
adoptive
status
to
the
present
parents?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
to
the
present
adoptive
parents.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
based
on
the
best
interests
of
the
child?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
if
the
indian--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so...
so,
it's
open
to
the
present
adoptive
parents
to
argue
that
it's
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child
because
of
the
bonding
that
has
taken
place
over
the
last
few
years,
that
they
should
be
given
custody
of
the
child?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
isn't
there
substantial
law
to
the
effect
that
on
abandonment,
the
child
takes
the
domicile
of
the
parent?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
natural
parents.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
the
abandonment...
whenever
there's
an
abandonment,
the
child
takes
the
domicile
of
the
place
where
the
abandonment
takes
place?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
restatement
is
contrary,
is
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
restatement
on
conflicts?
