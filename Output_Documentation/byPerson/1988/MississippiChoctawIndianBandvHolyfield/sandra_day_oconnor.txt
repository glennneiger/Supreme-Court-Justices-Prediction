justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
smith,
i
guess
the
statute
in
section
1911
says
the
indian
child's
tribe
shall
have
a
right
to
intervene
at
any
point
in
the
proceeding,
in
a
state
court
proceeding,
involving
termination
of
parental
rights.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
tribe
did
intervene
pursuant
to
that
statute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
tantamount
to
an
intervention
in
the
proceeding?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
was
the
timing
of
that
motion
by
the
tribe?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
that
after
the
adoption
had
become
final?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
this
court
has
appellate
jurisdiction
of
this
claim
of
the
tribe?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
the
court
below
just
didn't
deal
with
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
the
state
court
was
just
applying
it
own
state
law
to
determine
the
domicile
of
the
child.
isn't
that
what
happened,
and
isn't
that
a
fair
reading
of
what
the
court
below
did?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
it
was
a
fair
reading
of
the
court
opinion
that
we're
being
asked
to
review
here,
that
it
was
applying
a
matter...
as
a
matter
of
state
law
in
mississippi
a
determination
that
this
child
was
domiciled
in
mississippi.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so,
i
have
difficulty
knowing
how
we
have
appellate
jurisdiction.
now,
perhaps
we
could
grant
certiorari,
but
it's
very
difficult
for
me
to
understand
how
we
have
appellate
jurisdiction
here.
for
what's
it
worth,
i
share
justice
o'connor's
concern.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
1911(a)
just
says
that
an
indian
tribe
shall
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
a
child
custody
proceeding
involving
a
child
who
resides
or
is
domiciled
within
the
reservation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now
you
have
a
child
that
was
born
off
the
reservation,
and
a
state
court
saying
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
it
isn't
domiciled
on
the
reservation.
that's
what
we
have,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
generally
speaking
we
accept
the
determination
of
state
laws
that's
determined
by
the
state's
highest
court.
you
just
want
us
to
say
that
that's
preempted
by
federal
law.
i
mean,
i
think
it's
very
difficult
for
us
to
say
that
isn't
the
state
law
of
mississippi.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
your
view
of...
of
the
federal
law,
you
apparently
take
the
position
that
an
indian
parent
who
would
like
to
place
an...
an...
that
parent's
illegitimate
child
with
a
non-indian
family
would
have
to
permanently
leave
the
reservation
to
do
it
and
establish
domicile
outside
the
reservation.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that's
what
congress
intended?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
there's
just
no
way,
as
a
practical
matter,
that
the
child
would
be
placed
off
the
reservation
with
non-indian
parents?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
how
many
people?
you
said
acres.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
where
does
it
say
that?
i
don't
find
it
in
the
statute,
and
i'd
be
interested
to
know
where
you
find
it
in
the
statute.
i...
i
was
looking
at
915
and
did
not
see
it
there.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
was
congress'
policy
in
adopting
the
act.
where
does
it
say
that
the
best
interests
of
the
child
is
the
standard
to
be
used
by
a
court
or
the
tribe
in
placing
the
child?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
there
is
some
indication
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
intended
to
leave
to
state
law
the
question
of
determination
of
domicile.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
it
clearly
contemplated
some
proceedings
in
state
courts.
it
does
that
expressly
in
the
statute.
and
there's
some
indication
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
was
leaving
the
question
of
domicile
to
be
determined
by
state
law.
isn't
that
so?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
certainly
didn't
define
domicile.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
did
not
choose
to
define
domicile
in
the
statute.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
cases
cited
in
the--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
the
cases
cited
in
the
house
report
certainly
indicated
some
satisfaction
with
the
operation
of
state
law
on
that
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
take
it
you
concede,
however,
that
the
mother
never
changed
her
lawful
domicile
from
the
reservation.
she
simply
left
it
to
have
the
children.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
court
below
made
the
issue
of
domicile
turn
on
a
theory
of
abandonment,
i
take
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
miller--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--what
congress
did
say
in
section
1915
was
that
in
any
adoptive
placement
of
an
indian
child
under
state
law,
a
preference
shall
be
given,
in
the
absence
of
good
cause
to
the
contrary,
to
placement
with
a
member
of
the
child's
extended
family,
other
members
of
the
indian
child's
tribe
and
other
indian
families.
now,
presumably
that
section
is
binding
on
even
the
state
court.
isn't
that
so?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
did
the
state
court
here
follow
that
preference?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
old
are
the
children
now?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
isn't
correct,
is
it?
under
subsection
b
it
says
that
an
indian
child
not
domiciled
or
residing
within
the
reservation
of
the
tribe,
that
the
state
court
will
transfer
the
proceeding
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tribal
court
on
request
of
the
parent
or
the
tribe.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
your
position
here
is
the
parents
have
objected
in
effect
to
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
it
does
mean
that
section
1911
applies
in
state
court
proceedings--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
children
not
domiciled
on
the
reservation.
