mr.
edwin
r.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
only
ten
years
have
passed
since
this
court's
ruling
in
united
states
v.
john,
where
the
mississippi
courts
were
attempting
to
apply
state
laws
to
indians
within
the
territorial
jurisdiction
of
the...
of
the
choctaw
indian
reservation.
at
stake
in
that
case
was
not
simply
the
indian
country
status
of
the
reservation
lands,
but
ultimately
the
legal
existence
of
the
mississippi
band
of
choctaw
indians
as
a
tribal
government.
despite
this
court's
unanimous
ruling
in
john
vindicating
the
tribe's
rights
to
a
separate
jurisdiction,
now
a
decade
later,
mississippi
courts
are
once
again
seeking
to
apply
state
laws
to
choctaw
indians
of
the
choctaw
reservation.
at
stake
this
time
is
potentially
not
simply
the
future
existence
of
the
appellant,
mississippi
band
of
choctaw
indians,
but
the
future
existence
of
indian
tribes
nationwide
as
identifiable
cultural
entities.
the
issues
before
this
court
arose
within
the
context
of
the
state
adoption
proceeding,
a
non-indian
white
couple
from
down
on
the
coast
petitioned
a
state
court
to
adopt
twin
full-blooded
choctaw
indian
babies
immediately
following
their
birth
at
an
off-reservation
hospital.
both
the
natural
mother
and
the
putative
father
in
this
case
were
and
still
are
resident
and
domiciled
on
the
choctaw
indian
reservation.
quite
simply,
the
mother
left
for
the
short
period
of
approximately
ten
days
for
the
purpose
of
giving
birth,
signing
over
the
children
for
adoption
and
returning
to
the
reservation.
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
no,
sir,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
but
there
is
a
crucial
distinction
here
in
that
the
standing
of
the
mississippi
band
of
choctaw
indians
has
been
vested
by
statute,
and--
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
--the...
the
statute
provides
a
vested
interest
in
the
tribe
in
the
placement
of
its
indian
children,
and
that
is
precisely
what's
at
stake
here.
we're
alleging
that
the
children
were
wrongfully
taken
from
the
tribe,
and
therefore
they...
they
have
suffered
a
wrong.
they
have
suffered
an
injury.
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
yes,
sir,
your
honor,
i
believe
they
do.
the
distinction
would
be
that
the...
the
tenth
amendment
provides
that
all
powers
not
vested
are
reserved
to
the
states.
now,
in
this
particular
case
the
powers
were
specifically...
or
the
power
to
regulate
indian
affairs
was
vested
by
the
constitution
in
congress.
and
congress,
in
turn,
has
by
statute
conferred
a
protected
interest
in
the
tribe
in
the
future
of
its
children.
as
the
statute
says
that
they
are
of
paramount
importance
to
the
future
of
the
tribe
itself.
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
the
tribe
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss,
alleging
that
the
state
court
lacked
jurisdiction
over
this
proceeding.
it
is
our
contention--
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
--yes,
i
would
say
it
was
tantamount
to--
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
--the
motion
was
filed
as
soon
as
the
tribe
learned
that
the
adoption
had
gone
on
through.
i
think
it's--
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
--that
was
after
the
adoption
became
final,
but
important
to
this
case
i
think
to
understand
is
that
even
before
the
children
were
born,
the
tribe
had
become
aware
that
the
adoption
was
going
to
take
place
and
had
notified
the
proposed
adopting
couple,
as
well
as
their
counsel,
that
there
was
this
federal
law
that
did
govern,
and
that
the...
the
natural
mother
was
resident,
domiciled
on
the
reservation,
and
that
therefore
1911(a)
would
vest
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
tribal
court.
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
i
am
not
certain,
but
i
believe
it
was
something
like
three
or
four
weeks.
we
had...
we...
the
opposing...
or
the
counsel
handling--
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
--yes.
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
we
had
been
making
repeated
attempts
to
try
and
notify
opposing
counsel
and
tried
to
keep
abreast
of
what
was
going
on
and
were
not
able
to
learn
until
after
the
adoption
was
in
place.
we
received
a
copy
of
the
decree.
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
i
believe
that
in
many
respects
this
case
is
a
carbon
copy
of
the
john
v.
mississippi
portion
of
the
u.s.
v.
john
case.
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
i...
i
think
that
it's
a
matter
of
interpretation
and
that
there
is
a
lot
of
guesswork
that
has
to
take
place
on
this
case
as
to
precisely
what
the
court
did
and
did
not
do
in
here.
under
one
theory
they
are,
in
effect,
enacting,
or
they
are
legislating,
the
residence
and
domicile
under
a
new
set
of
rules
that
they...
they
adopted
for
this
specific
case.
and
in
doing
so,
they
are
imputing
these
rules
of
residency
and
domicile
to
the
choctaw
reservation
as
well
to
say
that
they
are
not
residents
and
domiciliaries
of
the
reservation.
to
the
extent
that
they
try
and
do
this--
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
--i
believe,
your
honor,
that
both
readings
are
consistent,
that
under...
on
the
one
hand,
they
could
have
been
saying
that
the
rules
of
residence
and
domicile
are
that
they
have
to,
one,
be
physically
present
within
the
jurisdiction
and,
two,
that
it
has
to
be
consistent
with
the...
the
expressed
intent
of
the
natural
mother.
and
then
they
are
taking
these...
these
two
newly
fashioned
rules,
these
departures
from
the
previous
rule
that
the
state
of
mississippi
had
on
residence
and
domicile,
and
they
are
applying
them
onto
the
reservation
to
say
quite
simply
this
mother
was
not
a
resident
and
domiciliary.
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
but
it
is--
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
--yes,
sir.
because
it
is
necessary
in
this
case
to
make
a
determination
that
these
children...
or
that
the
natural
mother...
or
note
that
these
children
were
not
residents
at
law
and
domiciliaries
at
law
of
the
choctaw
reservation.
and
the
only
way
that
this
could
have
possibly
taken
place
was
to
apply
these
newly
fashioned
standards
onto
the
reservation
to,
in
effect,
expatriate
these
children,
because
otherwise
1911(a),
i
believe
is
quite
obvious,
would
apply
and
would
make
it
clear
that
the
state
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction,
which
is
our
contention
here.
as
to
the
matter
of
the
certiorari
jurisdiction,
i
believe
that
opposing
counsel
has
failed--
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
that's...
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
but
i
believe
that
to
the...
i
think
that
there
are
two
crucial
things
here.
one
of
them
is
that
that
was
not
the
state
law
up
until
this
particular
case.
in
1975
the
mississippi
supreme
court
said
that
it
was
unquestioned
that
the
residence
of...
of
a
minor
was
that
of
its
parent
or
guardian...
of
its
natural
parent.
and
this
was
in
the
in
re
watson
case.
so,
first
of
all,
this
was
a
newly
fashioned
rule,
which
i
think
is--
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
--we
have...
we
have
no
dispute
with
mississippi's
right
to
create
such
a
law,
but
we
do
have
a
dispute
with
their
right
to
be
able
to
apply
that
in
a
manner
such
as
here
to
divest
the
tribe
of
its
rights
to
adjudicate
over
these
minor
children.
as
far
as
the
certiorari
jurisdiction
of
the
court
goes,
i
would
note
that
the
appellant
in
his
reply
brief
raised
no
objection
to
the
certiorari
jurisdiction.
so,
justice
blackmun,
i
would...
i
too
am
in
agreement
that
the
certiorari
jurisdiction
of
this
court
would
lie
in
this
case.
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
yes,
i...
i
believe
that
congress
intended
through
this
legislation
to
make
it
less
easy
for
the
state
courts
to
be
able
to
come
in
and
to
remove
these
children
from
their...
from
their
homes.
i
think
that
the
legislative
history
makes
it
clear
that
there
is
a
very
major
problem
within
indian
tribes.
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
then
i
would
maintain
that
both
parents
would
have
to
go
into
that
state
and
legitimately
establish
residence
and
domicile.
and
once
they
have
done
that,
then
they
could
avail
themselves
of
the
state
court's
jurisdiction
in
a
basis
like
this.
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
the
state
statutes
do
not
establish
any
specific
time
period.
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
no,
the
federal
statute
doesn't.
i
believe
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
state
to
make
that
determination
once
they
had
legitimately
gone
off
reservation
with
the
specific
intent
to
establish--
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
--that's
correct,
but
as
a
practical
matter--
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
--because
they
never
left,
they
never
abandoned
their
residence
and
domicile
on
the
reservation.
they
are
still
residents
and
domiciliaries...
the
natural
parents
are...
of
the
reservation.
under
normal
common
law,
the
residence
of
a
minor
child
is
that
of
its
natural
parent
or
parents.
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
the
mississippi
court
disagreed
and
made
the
departure
on
this
one
specific
case.
prior
to
this
in
all
other
cases,
the
mississippi
court
has
followed
that
rule.
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
and
virtually
all
states
in
the
union
do
follow
that
rule.
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
and
i
don't
think
that's
unreasonable.
if
you
live
in
a
jurisdiction,
you're
subject
to
their
laws.
and
the
pattern
of
laws
in
this
country
is
such
that
they
do
impute
certain
legal
statuses
to
certain
situations.
in
the
case
of
a
minor,
the
pattern
of
law
throughout
has
invariably
been
that
a
minor
acquires
the
residence
and
domicile
of
its
natural
parent.
i
don't
frankly
see
what
the
problem
is
with
allowing
that
to
be
a
federal
rule
of
residence
and
domicile
for
purposes
of
this
act.
as
far
as--
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
--yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
i
think
that
that...
that
is
an
extreme
extension
of
it,
yes.
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
i
believe--
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
--yes,
that...
that
is
one
of
those
tough
situations.
but
i
believe
too
that
in
the
majority
of
cases
there
would
be
some
other
types
of
supervening
factors
that
would
come
into
play.
i
think,
for
example,
that
there
could
well
be
a
matter
of
abandonment
that
would...
would
come
in
and
would...
would--
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
--yes.
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
to
the--
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
--to
mrs.
holyfield?
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
yes,
it
does.
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
yes,
that's
true.
and--
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
--[inaudible]
were
to--
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
--yes,
your
honor.
and
that
certainly
would
be
a
factor
that
would
come
into
play.
i
feel...
i
feel
that
the
tribal
court,
in
the
event
this
case
were
to
be--
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
--the--
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
--the
tribal
court
i
believe
would
follow
the
preference
placement
standards
of
the
indian
child
welfare
act,
and
if
they
were
able
to
pass
through
the
various
tiers
down
in
their
examination...
or
in
the
compiling
of
the
evidentiary
record,
if
they
could
pass
down
through
the
various
levels
of
preference
to
that
situation
successfully,
yes,
they
could.
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
yes,
that's
in
essence
what
the
statute
says,
but--
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
--i
disagree
because
i
believe
that
the
court
could
work
its
way
through
in
an
appropriate
situation.
now,
if
this
were
an
arbitrary
placement
with
a
non-indian
family
where,
for
instance,
the
facts
were
very
bad
or
the...
the
suitability
of
the
non-indian
family
was
very
weak,
no,
i
don't
believe
that
the
tribal
court
would
ever
approach
that.
but
on
the
other
hand,--
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
--if
the...
the--
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
--that's
true.
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
the
choctaw
reservation
has
grown
somewhat
since
the
john
decision,
justice
blackmun.
it
is
now
around
23,000
acres,
and
i
believe
it
was
around
20,000
at
the
time
of
the
john
decision.
but
they...
they
are
now--
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
--yes.
how
many
people?
according
to
a
1981
enumeration
of
the
choctaw
population,
there
were
4,361.
in
1986
there
were
4,478,
but
there
is
a
possibility
of
an
under-count
of
approximately
150
on
the
latter
number.
of
this,
one-seventh
of
the
tribe
lives
off
reservation.
the
other
six-sevenths
live
on
reservation.
and
they
are
in
the...
in
seven
predominant
communities
that--
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
--is
on
reservation.
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
yes.
one-seventh
off
reservation.
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
i
don't
really
know
the
answer
to
that,
justice
blackmun.
i
think
the
one
thing
that
might
come
into
play
here
is
that
with
the
mississippi
band
of
choctaw
indians
membership,
blood
quantum
requirements
are
one-half
or
more
degree;
and
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
in
oklahoma
it's
considerably
less,
but
it's
either
one-fourth
or
lower
than
that.
and--
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
--yes.
the
statutory
standard
is
the
best
interest
of
the
tribe...
of
the
child.
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
section
1902,
congress
hereby
declares
as
the
policy
of
this
nation
to
protect
the
best
interests
of
indian
children.
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
i
read
it
and
i
infer
it
through
1902.
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
that's
true.
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
yes,
it
does.
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
i
believe
that
all
of
these
interests
can
be
read
as
being
compatible
with
the
best
interests
of
the
child.
and
i
think
that
that
is
one
of
the
problems
that
congress
is
trying
to
address
in
this
legislation
is
the
fact
that
the
social
studies
have...
have
proven
that
the
children
who
are
removed
from
their
indian
homes
and
indian
environments
and
indian
culture
invariably,
as
they
reach
the
teenage
years,
the
overwhelm...
a
disproportionately
large
number
of
these
children
suffer
extreme
identity
problems.
the
rate
of
suicide
among
these
indian
children
is
double
what
it
is
children
at
the
reservation.
and
the
incidence
of
violence
and
drug
abuse
and
so
forth
are
likewise
far
in
excess
with
the...
with
the
children
who
are
placed
in
non-indian
homes
as
compared
with
those
who
are
born
and
reared...
are
reared
on
the
reservation
in
an
indian
environment.
so,
i
believe
that
congress
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
legislation
shows
that
there
was
a
thorough
inquiry
made
into
this
area
and
that
this
was
a
reasoned
decision
on
the
part
of
congress
for
the
protection
of
these
various
interests
involved
here.
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
i--
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
--i
don't
believe
so,
justice
o'connor.
i...
i
believe
that
you
get
that
indication--
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
--pardon?
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
it
did
not
expressly
define...
define
domicile
in
the
final
craft
of
the
statute,
but
in
the--
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
--initial
draft--
mr.
edwin
r.
smith
--it
expressed
the
satisfaction
with
the
operation
of
the
state
laws
that
applied
that
accepted
the
notion
that
a
minor
child
acquires
the
residence
and
domicile
of
its
natural
parent.
and
i
believe
that
that's
why
they
were
citing
the
wakefield
v.
littlelight
decision
and
the
greybull
case
and
the
potowatomy
case.
as
far
as
the
legislative
history
on
this
goes,
the
initial
draft
of
the
indian
child
welfare
act
with
the
section
which
is
comparable
now
to
101(a)
of
the
act
or
1911
stated...
and
i'll
quote...
"for
purposes
of
this
act,
an
indian
child
shall
be
deemed
to
be
a
resident
of
the
reservation
where
his
parent
or
parents
is
resident.
"
and
that's
in
124
cong.
rec.
,
part
19,
at
page
37,
224
of
november
4,
1977.
so,
at
least
in
the
very
initial
draft
of
this
statute,
it
was
very
clearly
intended
by
congress
that
a
minor
child
would
acquire
at
law
the
residence
and
domicile
of
its
indian
parent.
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
elsewhere
that
ever
indicates
a
conscious
decision
to
depart
from
this
rule.
in
addition,
the
legislative
history
said
that
it
can...
in
reference
to
the
wisconsin
potowatomies
case
and
the
wakefield
and
the
greybull
decision,
stated
that
they
can
form
the
developing
federal
and
state
case
law
holding
that
the
tribe
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
when
the
child
is
residing
or
domiciled
on
the
reservation.
and
again,
all
of
these
cases
entailed
the
application
of
the
rule
that
a
minor
would
acquire
the
residence
and
domicile
at
law
of
its
natural
parent.
and
in
some
of
these
cases,
the
children
were
off
the
reservation
and
the
parents
were
on
reservation,
and
the
court
in
those
decisions
did
affix
the
on-reservation
residence
and
domicile
to
the
natural
child
and
did
so...
and
in
the
process
of
doing
so,
they
divested
the
state
of
its
jurisdiction.
so,
we're
not
coming
in
here
with
a
unique
or
a
novel
rule
of
law.
we're
simply
saying
that
this
is
an
old
standard.
this
is
a
practice
standard
in
all
other
states.
this
has
been
the
practice
standard
in
the
state
of
mississippi
up
until
this
specific
case,
and
i
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
mississippi
court
was
an
attempt
to
divest
the
tribe
of
jurisdiction
expressly
conferred
by
section
1911(a)
of
the
indian
child
welfare
act.
it
was
also
an
attempt
to
imply...
to
apply
their
standard
of
law
to
the
reservation
and
to
indians
of
the
reservation.
and
i
believe
and
i
maintain
that
this
is
simply
in
so
many...
all
too
many
respects
a
rehash
of
the
john
decision.
mississippi
courts
are
once
again
trying
to
divest
the
tribes
of
their
lawful
jurisdiction
over
their
citizens
of
their
reservation.
and
i
submit
that
this
is
precluded
by
the
indian
child
welfare
act,
and
i
believe
that
this
court
has
also
indicated
that
it
was
precluded
by
the
fisher
v.
district
court
decision.
i
might
note
that
in
the
fisher
v.
district
court
decision,
this
court
noted
such
things
as
the
birth
of
a
child
off
reservation
were
minimal
and
that
therefore
they
would
be
disregarded
in
determining
that
the...
the
reservation
did
have
exclusive
jurisdiction.
and
i
submit
that
the...
the
simple
act...
the
mississippi
court
makes
such
a
big
point
of
these
children
having...
or
of
this
mother
having
gone
to
what
they
call
great
lengths
to
give
birth
to
these
children
off
reservation,
when
the
reality
is
that
all
children
of
the
choctaw
reservation
and
approximately
90
percent
of
the
indian
children
of
this
nation
are
born
off
of
reservation.

less
than
200
miles,
i
believe.
mr.

r.
smith
yes,
about
50
to
70
miles
is
the
norm.
