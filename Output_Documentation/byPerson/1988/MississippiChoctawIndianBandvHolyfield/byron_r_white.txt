i
would
think
to
give
congress'
judgment
about
what
the
best
interests
of
the
indian
child
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
well,
i
don't
think
courts
have
any...
have
any
independent,
open-ended
authority
to,
to
decide
what
the
best
interests
of
the
child
is,
contrary
to
what
congress
says
they
are.
justice
byron
r.
white
--what
is
it...
do
i...
i
take
it
you
submit
that
1911
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well--
justice
byron
r.
white
--i
thought
you
said
that
1911
just
didn't
even
refer
to
adoptions
and
i
thought
you
meant
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
--that...
it's
beside
the
point,
then,
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
you
just...
you
seemed
to
give
it
away
just
a
minute
ago.
you
seemed
to
agree
with
justice
scalia
that...
that...
these
provisions
in
1913
didn't
trump
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
tribe.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about...
if
you're
right,
of
course,
then
there's
nothing
in
1911
that
would
give
the
tribe
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
the
adoption
of
children
that
are
indian
children
that
are
born
on
the
reservation.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
think
the
rule
is
if
a...
when
there's
an
adoption
proceeding
in
the
tribal
court
on
the
reservation?
can
the
tribal
court
agree
to
an
adoption
by
non-indian...
by
non-indians
off
the
reservation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
that's...
that's...
the
preference
list
refers
to...
refers
to
adoptions
under
state
law
and
any
adoptive
placement
of
an
indian
child
under
state
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
an
adoption
under
tribal
law?
does
this...
does
this
preference
list
apply
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
1911
just
applied
to...
to
children
that
are...
that
are
domiciled
on
the
reservation.
