we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
87-980,
the
mississippi
band
of
choctaw
indians
v.
orrey
curtiss
holyfield,
et
ux.
mr.
smith,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
smith,
i'm
troubled
a
little
bit
by
what
might
be
a
standing
problem
here.
the
only
petitioner
is
the
choctaw
band,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
this
were
a
case
that
didn't
involve
indian
tribes,
but
involved
people
in
california,
say,
getting
a
divorce
from
one
another
and
the
state
of
nevada
felt
very
strongly,
since
they
had
been
both
domiciled
in
nevada,
that
nevada
courts
should
have
had
jurisdiction
rather
than
the
california
courts,
do
you
think
the
state
of
nevada
by
itself
could
come
before
us
and
say,
well,
the
california
courts
had
no
jurisdiction
here,
they
should
have
done
it
in
nevada?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
the
statute
say
in
so
many
words
that
the
mississippi
band
shall
have
a
standing
to
raise
this
sort
of
a
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if...
what
if
both
parents
want
their
child
to
be
adopted
through
the
state
system?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how...
supposing
these
people
decided
to
move
from
the
reservation...
was
the
baby
born
in
gulfport?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
long
would
they
have
had
to
live
in
gulfport
in
order
to
be
able
to
have
the
child
adopted
through
state
proceedings?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i
thought...
i
thought
you're
suggesting
there's
some
federal
rule
because
of
the
indian
child
welfare
act
but...
that...
their
intention
is
apparently
not
relevant
in
your
view
because
they
obviously
wanted
the
child
adopted
in
the
state
proceeding.
you
say
federal
law
prohibits
them
from
doing
it
unless
they've
independently
established
some
domicile.
now,
is...
does
the
federal
principle
that
you
deduce
from
the
statute
require
some
period
of
residence
in
gulfport?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
these
people
legitimately...
i
mean,
unless
they
need
some
sort
of
a
permit
to
get
off
the
reservation,
they
went
into
gulfport
to
have
the
baby
born.
the...
gulfport
isn't
on
the
reservation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
doesn't
this
meet...
why...
why
doesn't
their
act
here
meet
your
test?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
the
mississippi
court
disagreed
with
you
here
at
least
as
to
mississippi
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you...
you
say
that
the...
the
parents
here
would
have
had...
if
the
have
a
house
on
the
reservation,
they
would
have
had
to
sell
the
house
and
rent
a
place
in
gulfport
and
establish
a
home
there
before
they
could
be...
have
their
child
adopted
in
the
state
proceedings.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
goes
on...
1902
goes
on
and
says
the
congress
hereby
declares
that
it
is
the
policy
of
this
nation
to
protect
the
best
interests
of
indian
children
and
to
promote
the
stability
and
security
of
indian
tribes
and
families
by
establish
a
minimum
federal
standards
for
the
removal
of
indian
children.
i
would
think
a
court
looking
at
that
would
feel
there
are
several
policies
there,
not
just
the
best
interests
of
indian
children.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
far
is
it
from
philadelphia
to
gulfport?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it
they
could
have
picked
at
hospital
at
which
to
give
birth
closer
to
philadelphia
than
gulfport.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
smith.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
miller.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
is
section
1913?
is
it
in
the
petition
for
cert?
do
you
know
where
it
is
in
the
briefs?
it's
in
the
supplement
to
your
brief.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the...
okay.
go
ahead.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
section
1903
is
the
definitional
section,
and
it
says
child
custody
proceeding,
using
that
term
in
quotes,
shall
mean
and
include...
down
in
the
roman
numeral...
adoptive
placement
which
shall
mean
the
permanent
placement
of
an
indian
child
for
adoption
including
any
action
resulting
in
a
final
decree
of
adoption.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
miller.
the
case
is
submitted.
