mr.
edward
o.
miller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'm
edward
miller,
counsel
for
appellees.
the
appellees
are
four
parties:
the
adoptive
parents,
the
holyfields,
and
also
the
natural
indian
parents,
both
the
father
and
the
mother.
if
i
have
lapses
here,
i
apologize.
my
father
was
buried
monday,
and
he
died
friday
night
during
a
conversation
with
me.
so,
i've
had...
it's
been
a
real
struggle
for
me
to
keep
my
mind
on
the
right
track.
hopefully,
i
can
do
that
today.
i
would
first
like
to
say
that
the
reason
for
the
icwa,
the
indian
child
welfare
act,
was
a
good
one.
it
was
designed,
as
the
preamble
states,
to
prevent
the
breakup
of
indian
families.
and
it
was
designed
also
to
prevent
the
involuntary
taking
of
indian
children
by
non-indian
parents.
and
the
statute
recognizes
this,
and
congress
recognized
this
and...
by
establishing
two
proceedings
under
the
act.
under
section
1911,
which
surely
will
be
mentioned
several
more
times
before
this
proceeding
ends...
under
1911,
the
indian
tribe
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
indian
children
who
are
residing
or
domiciled
on
the
reservation.
the
facts
are
not
disputed
that
the
indian
children
in
this
case
never
resided
on
the
reservation.
the
indian
mother
left
the
reservation
and
had
these
children
in
harrison
county
hospital,
where
they
were
taken
subsequent
to
that
by
the
adoptive
parents
and
they
were...
entered
their
petition
for
adoption.
mr.
edward
o.
miller
that's
correct,
your
honor.
now--
mr.
edward
o.
miller
--that
was
one
of
the
issues.
yes,
ma'am.
justice
o'connor,
that
was
a
legal
abandonment,
which
has
also
been
upheld
in...
in
a
recent
case,
an
1986
case,
by
the
alaskan
supreme
court.
and
our
court
found
that
there
was
a
legal
abandonment
when
the
mother
traveled
to
harrison
county
and
had
these
children
and
placed
them
with
adoptive
parents.
these
adoptive
parents
did
not
go
to
the
reservation
and
take...
and
remove
these
children
from
the
reservation.
the
mother
went
to
great
lengths
to
see
that
these
children
were
born
in
harrison
county
and
that
they
were
placed
with
adoptive
parents.
this
is
reiterated
by
the
reaffirmations
of
the
consent
which
our
state
court
noted
and
i
think
which
you
have
copies
of.
subsequent
to
the
adoption
petition
being
filed,
they
reaffirmed
their
consent...
both
parents...
and
also
in
this
reaffirmation
stated
that
they
specifically
wanted
the
holyfields,
who
are
the
adoptive
parents,
to
have
these
children
and
to
adopt
these
children.
and
they
specifically
wanted
the
state
court
or
the
lower
state
court
in
harrison
county,
mississippi,
to
handle
this
proceeding.
under
section
1911,
which
is
the
first
section
of
the
act,
it
gives
the
tribal
court
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
children
who
are
domiciled
or
residing
on
the
reservation.
number
one,
the
children
have
never
resided
on
the
reservation.
and
our
state
court
decided
in
their
opinion
the
definition
of
domicile.
now,
i
think
it
has
been
incorrectly
stated
that
they
completely
reversed
their
position
on
the
issue
of
domicile
in
the
definition
of
domicile.
and
i
would
like
to
speak
to
that
briefly.
the
cases
being
referred
to
are
a
watson
case,
which
was
decided
almost
ten
years
ago.
in
that
particular
case,
in
the
watson
case,
the
children,
minors,
were
removed
from
the
county
of
their
domicile
by
a
grandparent
after
their
parents
were
killed
in
an
automobile
accident
in
that
county.
they
were
removed
and
a
guardianship
was
attempted
to
be
open
in
the
county
in
which
the
grandparent
lived,
and
the
court
says
you
have
to
go
back
to
where
those
children
and
the
parents
resided.
those
children
resided
in
the
county
with
their
parents,
their
natural
parents,
up
until
the
death
of
their
parents.
so,
there
is
no
conflict
there
with
our
state
court
opinion.
now,
the...
the
case
which
followed
that
was
the
case
of
stubbs
v.
stubbs,
and
in
that
case,
our
court
set
its
definition
of
determining
domicile.
in...
number
one,
they
said
that
domicile...
when
we
talk
about
domicile
and
residence,
i
think
we
enter
into
the
area
of
intent.
and
the
court
stated
that
the
intent
was
very
important.
so,
as
their
criteria
in
stubbs,
they
said
these
are
the
things
that
we
will
use
to
establish
domicile.
number
one
is
the
physical
presence.
number
two
is
the
intent,
and
number
three,
other
facts
and
circumstances
surrounding
the
particular
case.
so,
when
it
came
to
this
case,
they
said
that
the
domicile
of
the
child
was
the
domicile
of
the
adoptive
parents,
that
the
mother
went
great
lengths
to
bring
these
children
to
harrison
county
and
leave
them
with
adoptive
parents.
also,
they
used
this
other
principle,
justice
o'connor,
which
you
have
referred
to,
and
that
is
they
voluntarily
invoked
the
jurisdiction
of
the
lower
state
court.
now,
we
contend
under
section
1913,
we
have
a
voluntary
proceeding.
in...
in
that
regard,
congress...
if
congress
had
not
wanted
indian
children
to
be
adopted
by
anyone
other
than
indian
parents,
they
could
have
stated
in
one
sentence
our
intention
is
that
indian
children
in
no
circumstances
are
to
be
adopted
by
non-indian
parents.
congress
did
not--
mr.
edward
o.
miller
--yes,
ma'am?
mr.
edward
o.
miller
yes,
ma'am,
i
would
say
so.
mr.
edward
o.
miller
justice
o'connor,
they
did
not
because
they
looked
at
the
part
which
deals
with
the
good
cause.
the
good
cause
was
the
parents'
being
adamant
about
these
children
be
adopted
by
the
holyfields
and
bringing
these
children
to
harrison
county
and
invoking
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
they
were
actually
petitioners
in
this
case.
the
adoptive
parents
were
not
the
only
petitioners.
all
four,
the
adoptive
parents
and
the
natural
parents,
were
petitioners
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
o.
miller
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
i
would
certainly
think
that
it
would
be,
your
honor,
because
if
we
were
to
say
to
an
indian
woman
or
an
indian
father
that
you
are
not
able
to
allow
these
children
to
be
adopted
by
persons
other
than
non-indians
and
you're
not
allowed
to
invoke
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
in
the
state
within
which
you
live,
then
i
think
we
would
be
denying
to
an
indian
woman
the
rights
that
all
other
women
enjoy.
mr.
edward
o.
miller
well,
that
is
a
good
question,
justice
scalia.
mr.
edward
o.
miller
i
agree
it
would.
however,
i
think
section
1911
goes
back
and
takes
care
of
that
problem.
and
the
statute
says
under
section
1911
for
any
child
who
is
resided
or
domiciled
on
the
reservation.
in
this
case
at
hand,
this
is
not
the
case.
in
the
instance
that
you're
speaking
of,
i
believe...
or
maybe
i'm
inferring
it
from
your
comments...
the
children
would
have
resided
at
some
point
in
their
life
on
the
reservation.
mr.
edward
o.
miller
i
don't
think
that
that
would
change
it,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
o.
miller
in
my
opinion.
mr.
edward
o.
miller
no,
sir,
it
is
not.
it
is
not.
mr.
edward
o.
miller
the
adoptive
parent
or
the
persons
with
whom
it's--
mr.
edward
o.
miller
--oh,
your
honor,
not
to
my
knowledge.
this,
this
legal
abandonment
in
this
particular
case,
in
alaskan
case--
mr.
edward
o.
miller
--that's
correct
according
to
our
court
and
according
to
alaska's
supreme
court
in
an
'86
decision
which
is
mentioned
in--
mr.
edward
o.
miller
--well,
i
think
that--
mr.
edward
o.
miller
--yes,
sir,
i
would
think.
however,
the
legal
abandonment
is
one
of
the
exceptions
to
domicile,
or
the
common
law
definition
of
domicile
which
is
the
domicile
of
the
parent
being
in
this
case
the
natural
parent
would
be
the
domicile
of
the
child.
and
that
was
recognized
by
the
alaskan
supreme
court
in
a
1984
or
1986
decision,
which
we've
submitted
in
our
briefs.
and
again,
this
was
a
voluntary
proceeding,
and
i
wanted
to
touch
on
section
1913.
section
1913
sets
forth
certain
criteria
which
the
court...
and
i
would
anticipate
a
state
court
because
i
infer
from
reading
that
that...
it
mentions
state
courts,
and
i
would
infer
that
there
is
concurrent
jurisdiction
with
both
the
tribal
court
and
the
state
court.
and
congress
sets
forth
in
that
act
or
that
section
of
the
act,
1913,
certain
criteria
which
has
to
be
met
in
order
for
the
adoption
to
be
valid.
and
i
might
also
state
an
alaskan
case
which
i
was
referring
to,
section
1911,
that
court
stated
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
1911
and
1913
and
that
1911
does
not
refer
to
adoptions,
merely
child
custody
cases.
section
1913
is
the
only
section
that
refers
to
the
adoptive
placement
of
children.
and
this
is
the
section
which
we
followed.
and
our
state
supreme
court
stated
that
they
felt
the
lower
court
followed
the...
the
minimum
requirements
required
by
standard
law.
this
was
not
an
attempt
by
any
means
to
usurp
or
to
bypass
or
to
find
a
loophole
in
the
indian
child
welfare
act.
this
was
not
an
attempt
to
involuntarily
take
indian
children
from
a
reservation
and
place
them
in
the
custody
of
non-indians.
this
was
a
case
where
the
mother
and
father
sought
adoptive
parents
out.
these
children
were
born
in
harrison
county.
the
mother
went
to
great
efforts
to
see
that
they
were
and
then
placed
with
these
non-indian
parents.
we
feel
that
this
is
a
voluntary
proceeding.
we
feel
that
we
have
compiled
with
section
1913.
and
if
you
notice,
there
is
a
safeguard
that
congress
gave
us
in
1913,
or
gave
indian
parents.
in
section
1913--
mr.
edward
o.
miller
--it's
in
the
supplement
[inaudible]...
justice
scalia.
mr.
edward
o.
miller
in
section
1913,
there
is
a
safeguard
even
in
the
voluntary
proceeding.
and
this
safeguard
is
that
if
at
any
stage
of
the
proceeding
the
natural
parent
objects
before
the
final
decrees
have
been
entered
in
this
cause,
the
court,
being
the
state
court,
must
immediately
transfer
the
custody
of
that
child
back
to
the
indian
parent.
so,
there
are
even
safeguards
within
section
1913
which
is
a
voluntary
proceeding.
mr.
edward
o.
miller
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
o.
miller
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
edward
o.
miller
no,
sir.
no,
we're
asserting
that
if
these--
mr.
edward
o.
miller
--for
the
indian
parents
to
prevent
this
breakup
which
the
act
was
designed
to
prevent.
in
other
words,
under
that
voluntary
section,
the
state
court
can
transfer...
and...
and
the
act
says
they
must
transfer...
the
children
back
to
the
indian
parent
if
during
that
proceeding
and
prior
to
the
entry
of
the
final
decree
they
change
their
mind,
for
no
reason.
and
after
the
decree
has
been
entered
and
the
children
have
been...
the
adoption
decree
has
been
granted,
they
still
have
up
until
two
years
after
the
entry
of
decree
a
chance
to
come
back
and
allege
fraud
or
duress.
that
has
not
been
done.
mr.
edward
o.
miller
your
honor,
i'll
be
quite
truthful
with
you.
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
edward
o.
miller
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is--
mr.
edward
o.
miller
--yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
o.
miller
well,
i
would
have
to...
i
would
have
to
take
that
position--
mr.
edward
o.
miller
--because,
number
one,
we
would--
mr.
edward
o.
miller
--well,
okay,
your
honor.
i
think
up
until
the
time
they
assumed
the
jurisdiction.
i
think
once
the
jurisdiction
was
assumed,
that
the...
the...
the
proceeding
could
continue
through
the
state
court.
mr.
edward
o.
miller
well,
again,
i
was
quoting
the
alaskan
supreme
court,
but
you're
making
a
very
good
point.
it
does
not
speak
to
adoption.
it
speaks
to
the
child
custody.
it
speaks
to
both
of
those
in
section
1913.
but
again,
i
still
think
even
under
the
adoption
proceeding
under
1913,
the
parent
has
a
right
to
change
his
or
her
mind
and
to
enter
an
objection.
and...
and
according
to
the
act,
the
court
must
transfer
it
immediately
back
to
the
tribe.
mr.
edward
o.
miller
i
would
think
that
they
could,
but
i
think
there
is
a
preference
list
which
would
have
to
be
followed.
mr.
edward
o.
miller
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
o.
miller
i
would
think
that
it
would,
your
honor.
and...
and
the
reason
i
would
answer
that
in
that...
in
that
manner
would
be
that
because
of
the
indian
child
welfare
act,
it
would...
it
would
be
required
in
a
tribal
proceeding.
these
children
are
three
years
old.
they've
been
with
these
parents
since
they
were
a
few
days
old.
i
think
someone
suggested
a
bonding.
i
believe
justice
kennedy,
and
i
certainly
think
a
bonding
has
taken
place
here.
and
i
might
add
there
was
a
real
concern
here
that
both
of
these
children
would
be
placed
in
the
same
home.
these
are
twins.
these
are
twin...
this
is
a
twin
boy
and
girl.
and
there
was
some
concern
that
they
could
be
placed
in
a
home...
in
the
same
home.
mr.
edward
o.
miller
the
children
are
three
years
old,
justice
o'connor,
on
jan...
on
december
29
of
1988.
mr.
edward
o.
miller
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
o.
miller
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
o.
miller
ancillary
to
a
divorce
and
probably
to
an
involuntary
termination
of
parental
rights,
which
section
1912
is
devoted
to.
mr.
edward
o.
miller
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
o.
miller
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
o.
miller
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
o.
miller
well,
i
think
there
is
a
little
confusion
there.
i
think
there
is
a
little
confusion.
in
the
alaskan--
mr.
edward
o.
miller
--yes,
sir,
or
residing.
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
edward
o.
miller
that's
correct.
and
it
further
says,
justice
o'connor...
if
you
continue,
it
says
absent
objection
by
either
parent.
so,
if
the...
if
the
state--
mr.
edward
o.
miller
--well,
they
specifically
stated
that
in
their
reaffirmations
of
consent.
they
said
they
specifically
object
to
the
transfer
of
the
matter
to
the
tribal
court.
mr.
edward
o.
miller
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
edward
o.
miller
yes,
ma'am.
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
o.
miller
well,
there
again,
the
alaskan
supreme
court
in
an
'84/'86
decision
drew
this
distinction.
i'll
be
truthful
with
you,
your
honor.
i
don't
know.
i
guess
we--
mr.
edward
o.
miller
--yes.
mr.
edward
o.
miller
but
i
was
not
sure
we
were
here
to
decide
on
that
issue.
i
think
a
child
custody
case
and
an
adoption
proceeding
can...
are
very
similar.
mr.
edward
o.
miller
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
o.
miller
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
o.
miller
no,
sir.
i
don't
either.
mr.
edward
o.
miller
yes,
sir,
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
o.
miller
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
o.
miller
that's
why
we
proceeded,
your
honor--
mr.
edward
o.
miller
--and
we
would...
we
would
suggest
to
you
that
we
proceeded
under
section
1913.
mr.
edward
o.
miller
yes,
sir.
and
i
mentioned--
mr.
edward
o.
miller
--yes,
sir.
and
that
was
a
very
good
question
by
justice
stevens.
and
again,
i...
i
was
a
little
confused.
i
should
have
been
better
prepared,
your
honor.
i
apologize.
again,
this
was
a
case
in
which
non-indian
parents
did
not
go
on
to
a
reservation
and
remove
these
children.
it
was
a
case
where
the
indian
father
and
indian
mother
came
to
harrison
county
and
went
to
great
efforts
to
see
that
these
children
were
adopted
by
the
holyfields.
and
we
again
would...
would
suggest
that
this
was
a
voluntary
proceeding.
they
proceeded
under
section
1913.
they
followed
the
guidelines.
as
the
supreme
court
of
our
state
said
to
the
lower
court,
they
said
they
have
followed
the
minimum
federal
standards.
and
we
feel
at
this
time
these
children
have
been
with
the
parents
for
three
years.
we
feel
like
we've
compiled
with
the
law.
we
do
not
attempt...
the
parents
did
not
attempt
to
usurp
this
act
or
to
get
around
this
act.
but
we
do
feel
that
congress,
when
it
enacted
it,
certainly
conceived
and
thought
that
there
would
be
instances
where
these
children
would
be
adopted
through
our
state
courts.
and
this
was
one
of
those
cases.
and
we
feel
that
we're
not
in
conflict
and
this
was
a...
we
feel
that
our
state
law
and
our...
our
act,
the
icwa,
is
not
in
conflict
with
each
other.
and
we
also
feel
like
that...
that
the
tribe
lacks
standing.
the
one
person...
the
parents...
the
only
persons
we
feel
that
would
be
adversely
affected
by
this
act
would
be
the
natural
parents
themselves.
and
these
children
are
eligible
for
membership
at
this
time
because
they
are
full-blood
choctaw
indians.
that...
that
does
not
change
or
this
case
would
not
change
that.
and
they
will
be
eligible
for
membership
for
the
rest
of
their
lives.
at
any
time
they
can
receive
full
membership
in
this
choctaw
tribe.
and
the
adoptive
parents
would
certainly
not
deny
that.
i'm
finished
unless
you
have
further
questions.
