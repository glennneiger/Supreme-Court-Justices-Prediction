this
is
a
subsidy
rather
than
a
regulation.
what
do
you
think,
mr.
george,
about
the
post
office
granting
of
specially
lower
rates
to
educational
materials?
that's
one
category
of
speech.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
shouldn't
amusement
materials
get
the
same
exemption?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
talking
there...
you
must
distinguish
between
a
tax
that
just
taxes
a
particular
activity
and
an
exemption
for
a
particular
activity
from
a
general
tax.
is
there
no
difference
between
those
two
in
our
cases?
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
the
threat,
the
threat
that
you're
worried
about
would
be
eliminated
if
texas
provided
that
this,
this
tax
would
apply
uniformly
to
all
magazines
including
those
sold
by
religious
organizations
and
dealing
with
religion
provided,
however,
that
every
religious
organization
that
pays
such
a
tax
will
receive
a
subsidy
from
the
state
in
the
amount
of
that
tax
that
they've
paid.
that
would
be
all
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
religious
organizations
do
not
get
special
mail
rates?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
they
do.
that's
granted.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
may
well
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
they're
not
excluded
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
argument
is
the
establishment
clause
excludes
them.
we
can
subsidize
everybody
else
but
not
these
religious
organizations
because
if
you
establish
the
clause--
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
you
reconcile
that
with
our
other
line
of
cases
that
say
that
the
first
amendment
not
only
prevents...
not
only
does
not
prevent
special
treatment
for
religion
but,
indeed,
requires
it
in
such
areas
as
employment
benefits.
somebody
who
says
i
don't
want
to
work
on
a
saturday
because
my
faith
prohibits
it.
we
say
you
have
to
make
an
exemption
for
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--even
though
you
don't
have
to
make
it
for
sportsmen
who
want
to
shoot
on
saturday
or
any
other
people
who
want
to
do
anything
else
on
saturday,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
now,
why
is...
why
is
special
treatment
of
religion
required
there,
but
here
it
is
not
only
not
required,
it
is
not
even
permitted.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
make
a
suggestion.
maybe
you
got
to
the
religious
issue
because
you
have
to
grapple
with
it
to
determine
that
this
is
an
irrational
distinction
because
the
state
is
going
to
say...
i
haven't
heard
the
state
yet,
but
i'm
sure
they're
going
to
say,
you
know,
we're
dealing
with
a
constitution
that
gives
special
privileges
to
religion.
we
have
a
supreme
court
jurisdiction
that
gives
special
privileges
to
religion.
we
have
decided
that
religion
is
important
enough
that
we're
going
to
give
special
privileges
to
religion
in
this
tax
law.
now,
if
it's
rational
for
the
constitution
and
if
it's
rational
for
the
supreme
court,
it's
rational
for
the
state
of
texas.
maybe
that's
why
you
drew--
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
that.
you're
saying
that
this
is
not
a
press
tax
as
was
involved
in
arkansas.
this
is
a
general
sales
tax.
justice
antonin
scalia
and,
therefore,
the
public
harmed
by
the
exemption
is
not
just
the
rest
of
the
press,
but
rather
the
entire
body
politic.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
burke,
what
if
i
think
it's
unconstitutional
for
the
texas
courts
to
say
after
the
fact,
after
the
years
have
passed,
we
are
retroactively
going
to
subject
religious
periodicals
to
taxes?
then
i
wouldn't
have
to
remand
to
the
texas
courts
at
all
if
i
thought
there's
no
power
in
the
texas
courts
whatever?
isn't
that
a
strange
procedure
to
decide
after
the
fact
that
prior
sales
have
been
subject
to
tax,
even
though
the
statute
says
on
its
face
they
are
not?
how
can
texas
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
doesn't
harm
anybody,
though,
to
do
that.
i
mean,
i
agree.
it's
very
upsetting
for
the
state,
but
it
doesn't
tromp
on
any
individual
rights.
but
i'm...
the
other
solution
that
you
suggest
is
open
to
the
state
suddenly
subjects
somebody
to
a
law
that
was
not
in
effect
at
the
time
the
sales
were
made.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
statute
said
religious
faith.
i
mean,
you
would
really
have
to
interpret
religious
faith
to
include
an
atheist
in
that.
it's
rather
strange,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
interpret
religious
faith
to
include
anti-religious
faith?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
stretching
it
about
as
far
as
you
can,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
burke,
i'm
not
sure...
were
you
saying
that
one
of
our
cases
we
have
a
jehovah's
witness
case
that
rested
on
establishment
clause
grounds?
justice
antonin
scalia
free
exercise
clause
grounds?
justice
antonin
scalia
murdock.
and
you're
saying
just
as
we,
just
as
the
state
couldn't...
must
make
an
exemption
from
a
general
licensing
law
for
the
sale
of
those
pub...
was
it
clear
that
that
was
a
sale
case?
