well,
that
was
treated
as
a
question
of
standing,
though,
wasn't
it,
in
writers'?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
ragland
treated
the
question
as
one
of
standing,
did
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
at
this
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
this
a...
is
your
first
amendment
argument
based
on
religious
clauses
or
just
on
the
first
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
is
it
an
equal
protection
case
or
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
it's
a
religious
message
that's
discriminated
for
or
against.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
you
would
be
here
if
they
exempted
magazines
about
agriculture
and
taxed,
god
forbid,
magazines
about
oil?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
wouldn't
you
be
making
the
same
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
because?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
taxed
somebody
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
it
could
be
argued
that
it
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
because
it's
an
irrational
distinction.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
first
amendment
proved
it's
an
irrational
distinction.
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
notice
you
put
it
in
your
second
paragraph.
