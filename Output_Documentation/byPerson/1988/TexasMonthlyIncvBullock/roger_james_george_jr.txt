mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
texas
monthly
is
a
general
interest
magazine
published
by
a
commercial
corporation
in
texas
with
circulation
of
roughly
280,000
copies.
it
covers
various
topics
of
interest
to
people
in
texas
ranging
from
politics
to
religion,
to
sports,
to
food,
to
social
occasions,
to
all
sorts
of
things,
to
humor.
it
is
not
published
by
a
religious
faith,
and
it
is
not
a
religious
magazine.
it
is
simply
a
commercial
magazine.
it
brought
this
lawsuit
in
the
travis
county
district
court
in
travis
county,
texas,
to
recover
$149,107
in
sales
tax
that
it
had
paid
in
protest
under
the
applicable
texas
procedure
for
subscription
sales
during
a
period
in
1985
when
the
state
legislature
had
imposed
a
tax
on
subscription
sales
of
magazines.
now,
the
texas
sales
and
use
tax
system
is
a
system
similar
to
sales
and
use
tax
systems
throughout
the
country.
generally,
any
tangible
personal
property
that
someone
purchases
or
uses
in
texas
is
subject
to
the
tax.
thus,
if
i
go
across
the
street
from
my
office
and
buy
a
pair
of
socks,
i
have
to
pay
6.125
percent
of
the
purchase
price
to
the
state
of
texas.
if
i
buy
a
typewriter,
i
have
to
pay
the
tax.
if
my
wife
brings
back
a
blouse
from
washington
after
this
argument,
she's
supposed
to
pay
a
use
tax
when
she
puts
it
on
because
she
owes
6.125
percent
of
the
purchase
price
for
using
it
in
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
well,
that
was
one
of
the
issues
that
raised
in
the
court
below,
in
the
district
court,
and
our
contention
was
that
that
was
a
provision
that
was
ignored
and
ignored
involving
sales
and
use
taxes
generally.
there
are
a
plethora
of
exemptions
from
this
tax.
horses
and
mules,
for
example,
that
are
used
as
draft
animals
are
exempt.
as
one
might
expect
in
texas,
drill
stem
bits
for
drilling
equipment,
all
drilling
equipment
is
exempt
from
the
tax.
and
various
other
items
are
exempt
from
the
tax
ranging
from
fertilizer
to
airplanes
to
certain
shrimp
boats.
now,
two
of
the
exemptions
that
exist
in
this
tax
are
relevant
to
the
case
this
court
has
before
it
today.
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
well,
the
others
may
be
relevant
and
if
so
that
there
is
a
system
of
general
exemptions
or
random
system
of
exemptions
but
two
are
most
relevant
to
the
court's
consideration
today.
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
that
would
be
an
interesting
case,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
have
to
make
that
contention
today,
and
i'm
not
here
trying
to
make
that
contention.
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
i
am
here
concerning
only
two
of
the
exemptions,
really
one
of
the
exemptions.
the
first
exemption
is
one
to...
is
an
illustration,
and
that
is
there
is
an
exemption...
and
i'll
refer
to
them
by
the
last
three
digits
of
these
code
numbers...
section
310
of
the
statute...
which
is
a
general
exemption
from
tax
for
charitable,
religious,
civic
organizations,
volunteer
fire
departments,
the
boy
scouts,
and
the
chamber
of
commerce.
if
any
of
those
institutions...
goodwill
industries,
for
example...
buys
something...
the
methodist
church...
when
my
church
buys
something
and
uses
it,
it
does
not
have
to
pay
the
tax.
there
is
no
exemption
for
the
sale
of
goods
that
is
generally
applicable
to
those
institutions.
so
that
if
the
st.
vincent
de
paul
store
down
on
third
and
brazos
street
in
austin
or
the
goodwill
store
sells
my
magazine
or
sells
a
used
bicycle
or
sells
a
used
book,
they
have
to
collect
the
tax
and
remit
it
to
the
state.
and
if
the
tax
isn't
collected,
the
state
comes
after
them
for
the
tax.
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
yes.
it's
the
use
of
the
tax...
you
have...
the
tax
works
so
that
people
who
use
it
are
subject
to
tax
except
for
religious,
charitable,
educational,
the
boy
scouts
and
all
those
people.
but
if
those
institutions
sell
anything--
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
--now,
we
come
to
the
subject
of
this
lawsuit,
which
is
the
exemption.
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
texas
tax
the
crucifix.
if
they
sell
the
crucifix,
they've
got
to
collect
the
tax.
the
regulation
involving
this
very
statute.
if
they
sell
a
film
about
a
religious
subject,
they
have
to
collect
the
tax
from
the
taxpayer.
the
regulation
specifically
provides
that
if
they
sell
sheet
music...
for
example,
if
someone
sells
the
methodist
hymnal,
if
my
church
sells
a
methodist
hymnal,
that's
sheet
music,
and
i
suppose
the
comptroller
of
the
state
of
texas
requires
them
to
collect
the
tax
and
remit
it
to
the
state
of
texas.
now,
the
exemption
that
we're
here
about
today
reads
that
exempt
from
these
taxes
are
periodicals
that
are
published
or
distributed
by
a
religious
faith
and
they
consist
wholly
of
writings
promulgating
the
teachings
of
the
faith
and
books
that
consist
wholly
of
writings
sacred
to
a
religious
faith
are
exempt
from
the
taxes
imposed
by
this
statute.
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
that's
right.
and
the
trial
court--
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
--no,
sir.
in
the
trial
court
we
won
the
judgment
for
$149,107.73,
i
believe,
plus
interest,
and
that's
what
we're
trying
to
recover
here
today.
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
because
the
court...
excuse
me,
ma'am.
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
excuse
me,
justice
o'connor.
the
system
that
this
court
has
recognized,
and
it's
every
court
except
the
courts
of
arkansas
and
tennessee
and
i
can
find,
recognize
the
rule
that
courts
can't
impose
taxes.
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
texas
has
exempted
these
publications,
period.
this
court
nor
other
court
can
change
that
decision.
its
only
remedy
that
as
taxpayers
of
under-inclusive
statutes
have,
for
generations
have
is
that
they
don't
have
to
pay
the
tax
until
the
legislature
changes
the
law
and
taxes
all
the
people
that
are
similarly
situated.
and
that's--
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
--no,
no,
they
do
not.
they
have
contended
that
the
rule
ought
to
be
otherwise.
now,
the
rule
in
texas
has,
since
1885,
been
in
my
favor
under
state
law.
there
is
the
famous
pullman
case--
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
--the
state
trial
court
said.
the
appellate
court,
of
course,
ruled
that
the
statute
that
i
contend
is
unconstitutional
wasn't
unconstitutional
and
hadn't
reached
that
issue.
this
dissenting
judge--
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
--well,
i
believe
that's
an
issue
that...
well,
i
suppose
that
the
state...
a
possible
remand
to
the
court
would
be
possible.
technically
that
court
did
not
reach
that
issue.
the
sitting
judge,
judge
carroll,
in
that
court,
did
say
that
in
course
the
remedy
was
that
we
don't
have
to
pay
the
tax.
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
well,
we
have
some...
i
believe
every
court
in
the
state
of
texas
to
rule
on
that
has
ruled
in
my
favor.
the
comptroller
and
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
texas
take
a
contrary
position
in
this
case.
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
i've
got
to
win
the
merits
before
i
would
get
to
that
issue,
but--
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
--well,
i
don't
believe
it
is
relevant.
this
court
addressed
this
very
argument
in
the
arkansas
writers'
project
case.
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
no,
you
don't,
and
that's
the
reason
why
you
decided
in
the
arkansas
writers'
project,
the
arkansas
times
got
its
money
back.
it
was
suing
to
get
money
back
it
had
paid
under
the
arkansas
statute,
and
this
court
entered
a
judgment
allowing
it
to
recover
that
money.
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
i
suppose
it's
either...
its
standing
or
remedy
is
a
two-sided
coin,
obviously.
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
yes.
well,
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
in
that
case--
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
--decided
that
the
remedy
wasn't
available,
and
this
court
dealt
with
it
as
a
standing
issue.
do
you
have
standing
to
bring
it?
and
it
was
exactly
the
same
fact
situation
in
exactly
the
same
pattern;
that
is,
the
arkansas
magazine,
the
arkansas
times
sought
to
recover
taxes
it
had
paid
and
tried
to
get
back,
and
the
arkansas
supreme
court
said
you're
wrong
on
the
constitution,
but
if
you
were
right,
you
couldn't
get
your
money
back
because
that's
not
the
appropriate
remedy.
this
court
in
its
opinion
in
april
of
'87
said
no,
that's
wrong,
you
have
standing
to
bring
it.
now,
i
think
that
given
the
court's
decision
in
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
that,
in
fact,
this
court
has
decided
that
issue;
that
at
least
as
a
matter
of
law
of
the
united
states
that
my
client
is
entitled
to
bring
this
action
and
seek
this
remedy
and
if
it
is
entitled
to
get
it
back.
now,
again,
arkansas
decided
the
remedy
wasn't
available.
this
court
reversed
and
rendered
in
favor
of
the
taxpayer,
and
i
believe
that
case
is
directly
on
point.
now...
it's
as
on
point
as
any
case
you're
likely
to
see
in
this
court.
now,
my
client
brought
this
action
raising
three
basic
kind
of
arguments.
the
first
were
under
the...
the
first
two
were
under
the
minnesota
star
issue
that
we
raised:
one,
that
the
statute
as
applied
in
texas
was
discriminatory
against
in-state
magazines,
that
there
was
a
policy
of
not
collecting
the
tax
if
the
magazine
was
distributed
in
texas
by
somebody
who
wasn't
a
texas
resident,
and
that
as
applied
the
system
discriminated
against
subscription
sold
magazines.
the
district
court
chose
not
to
find
any
facts
or
deal
with
those
issues
at
all
and
simply
determined
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
because
it
constituted
a
discrimination
based
upon
the
content
of
the
speech;
that
is,
if
a
magazine
contained,
in
the
words
of
the
statutes,
"it
consisted
wholly
of
writings
promulgating
the
teachings
of
the
faith.
"
the
statute...
the
taxpayer
didn't
have
to
pay
the
tax.
and
that
was
unconstitutional
under
the
line
of
cases
that
includes
this
court's
decisions
from
police
versus
mosley
through
fcc
versus
the
league
of
women
voters
to
kerry
versus
brown
and
a
whole
series
of
cases
that
say
that
the
government
cannot
discriminate
and
impose
regulations
upon
speech
based
upon
the
content
of
that
speech.
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
justice
scalia,
that--
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
--justice
scalia,
that
is
a
logical
conclusion,
the
dissent
that
you
reached
in
those
cases,
in
the
arkansas
writers'
case,
was
a
logical
conclusion.
this
is
simply
a
subsidy
and
obviously
we
can
support
the
kennedy
center,
using
your
example,
from
that
case.
the
problem
is
history
not
logic.
and
if
this
court
will
review
the
history
of
the
imposition
of
penalties
involving
speech
from
the
stamp
acts
imposed
upon
the
english
press
through
grosjean
versus
american
publishing
company,
you
will
see
that
we
have
had
a
history
where
sometimes
legislatures
impose
taxes
and
where
there
is
a
suspicion,
at
least,
that
it
was
because
they
want
to
either
silence
or
in
some
way
chill
speech.
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
well,
if
you
will
look
back
at
the
english
example
of
the
stamp
act
taxes,
the
stamp
act
was
a
general
tax,
and
it
was
applied
to
newspapers.
and
if
you
will
review
the
court's
reciting
of
justice
sutherland's
opinion
in
grosjean,
you
will
see
that
that
was
indeed
the
case.
it
wasn't...
the
stamp
act
was
applied
to
all
sorts
of
things,
including
newsprint,
and
there
was
a
great
outcry
about
that.
but,
in
fact,
the
problem
is
intrusiveness
in
my
judgment.
the
problem
with
the
logical
position
about
subsidy
versus
history
is
that
my
magazine,
for
example,
my
client
contends
every
two
years
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
texas
meets,
and
in
those
sessions
they
have
all
kinds
of
statutes.
one
time
they
had
my
clients
were
exempt.
the
next
session
they
weren't
exempt.
and
now
they
are.
subscription
sales
are
exempt,
but
newsstand
sales
aren't
exempt.
now,
that
back
and
forth,
back
and
forth
occurs
in
this
area.
now,
each
year
my
client
writes
an
article,
writes
the
ten
best
and
ten
worst
legislators,
and
there
is
a
great
interest
in
that
because
it
is
a
widely
circulated
magazine.
and
there
is
some
political
careers
who
believe
that
they
have
been
seriously
damaged
by
being
on
the
ten
worst
and
some
that
have
been
greatly
enhanced
by
being
on
the
ten
best.
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
right.
my
problem
is
i
cannot
prove
that
stan
sludder,
a
representative
who
was
chairman
of
the
committee
in
1978,
took
that
exemption
out
because
he
didn't
like
being
on
the
"ten
worst"
list.
i
can't
prove
that.
and
the
courts
should
not
be
inquiring
into
that.
that's
why
we
need
and
why
the
court's
majority
in
arkansas
writers'
project
have
a
salutary
rule
that
because
while
exemptions
from
tax
and
subsidies
have
a
logical
symmetry...
we
have
justice
brennan's
dissent
in
the
walz
case
involving
exemption
from
church
property...
they
are
some
similar,
but
not
the
same.
and
the
lack
of
sameness
comes
from
history
as
much
as
logic.
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
well,
you
rapidly...
from
breaking
this
case
down
into
its
logical
components,
the
part
of
the
first
amendment
that
deals
with
the
press
and
the
speech
you
would
have
solved.
but
the
problem
with
the
speech
that
you
deal
with
the
establishment
clause,
you
certainly
wouldn't
have
solved
because
it's
clear
there
is
one
fundamental
message.
if
you
start
back
with
everson,
run
through
lindlin,
run
through
the
bowen
case
from
last
term
about
establishment
clause
cases,
and
that
is
the
state
cannot
subsidize
delivery
of
religious
message.
justice
o'connor's
concurrence
in
that
case
says
if
there's
nothing
else
clear
about
this
area
of
the
law
about
establishment
clause
law,
you
can't
do
that.
now,
you
could
not
have
a
system
that
said
every
time
i
pay
a
dollar
to
the
first
methodist
church
in
austin,
texas,
for
the
methodist
layman
that
comes
every
week,
that
they
give
that
church
six
and
a
quarter
cents
for
delivering
that
message
to
me.
now,
because
it
is
a
direct,
it
violates
every
tenet
of
the
lemon
test,
and
it
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
establishment
clause.
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
and
obviously
they
are
not
alone
in
getting
that.
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
--but
the
problem--
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
that's
true.
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
well,
justice
scalia,
we
have
had
since
walz
a
system
and
a
recognition
by
this
court
that
when
you
have
carved
out
a
general
category
of
institutions,
as
in
the
texas
constitution
and
texas
statutes
that
range
from
the
boy
scouts
to
the
methodist
church,
to
the
volunteer
fire
department,
to
hospitals,
to
libraries,
and
you
give
those,
all
those
good
works
or
good
institutions
a
special
kind
of
benefit,
a
tax
break,
a
subsidy,
as
in
the
bowen
case.
one
of
the
basic...
basis
of
the
court's
opinion
was
the
religious
organizations
weren't
singled
out
for
special
treatment.
the
problem
with
this
statute
is
that
only
whatever
religious
faiths
are,
are
singled
out
for
the
treatment.
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
you
would
not
have
the
establishment
clause
case,
and
if
it
didn't
depend
on
the
message,
we'd
have
the
kind
of
regan
case,
regan
versus
taxpayers
league,
that
involved
the
exemption
for
veterans'
organizations
and
501...
50(c)(3)(1)...
i'm
not
a
tax
lawyer...
exemption
that
involved
lobbying
because
it
wouldn't
depend
on
the
message
if
all
those
institutions
could
distribute
magazines
or
periodicals
or
other
institutions
free
of
the
message
being
determined.
the
problem
among
others
with
this
exemption
is
that
it
focuses
upon
the
message.
someone
has
to
determine
whether
the
message
is
the
appropriate
message
to
get
the
tax
benefit
whether
it
be
the...
it
says...
it
has
to...
it
has
to
consist
wholly
of
the
teaching
of
that
faith.
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
yes.
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
there's
no
question
that
there's
the
whole
line
of
cases,
jehovah
witness
cases
about
working
munitions
plants
that
this
court
has
decided.
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
one,
it
is
an
accommodation
to
the
exercise,
and
it
is
possible...
and
remember
in
texas
we
don't
have
special
treatment
for
religions
except
for
delivering
the
message.
if
they
sell
you
a
crucifix,
they've
got
to
pay
the
tax.
and
in
this
exemption,
for
example,
if
you'll
look
at
the
last
page
of
the
jurisdictional
statement,
the
regulation
promulgated
by
this
comptroller
says
if
they
sell
you
a
film,
they've
got
to
pay
the
tax.
it
is
possible
that
you
could
have
a
system
that
provided
for
exemptions
for
all
religious
messages
or
something,
and
that
might
be
a
different
case
because
somehow
taxing
the
message
would
be
intrusive
into
religions.
the
rationale
for
all
of
those
accommodations
of
exercise
is
that
we're
accommodating
the...
we're
somehow
accommodating
the
exercise
of
that
religious
activity.
now,
here--
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
--well,
those
cases
are
based
upon
a
concept
that
you
are
forcing
someone
to
violate
their
religious
tenets.
okay?
that
is,
i
am
forcing
that
gentleman
to
work
in
the
munitions
factory
on
the
tank
turret
or
forego
his
worker's
compensation,
and
it
is
against
his
religion
to
work
on
the
tank
turret.
now,
we
have
decided,
the
court
has
decided
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
principle
that
you
can't
require
him
to
choose
between
a
benefit
and
his
religion.
there
would
be
no
choice
between
benefit
and
religion
to
treat
the
delivery
of
this
tangible
good
like
all
other
tangible
goods,
or
to
collect
the
6.125
percent
tax.
they
can
give
it
away,
they
can
deliver
it
free
and
there's
no
tax.
it's
only
when
they
get
paid
by
the
person
who
buys
it
from
the
religion.
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
well--
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
--well,
the
argument
runs
first
that
it's
a
content-based
discrimination,
justice
white,
and
thus
you
get
arkansas
writers'
project
versus
ragland--
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
--in
my
judgment,
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
god
forbid.
and
i
would...
in
connection
with
the
arkansas
writers'
project--
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
--i
would
say
arkansas
writers'
project...
in
that
case
the
arkansas
statute
exempts
religious,
professional,
trades,
and
sport
journals.
and
this
court's
opinion
said
that
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
because
of
discrimination--
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
--on
the
base
of
content.
it's
a
discrimination
based
on
content.
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
well,
it's
not
one.
it
is
an
irrational
distinction.
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
now,
i
come
to
the
religious
issue
only
after--
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
--why?
because
it's
there,
i
suppose.
and
when
i
brought
this
case
arkansas
writers'
project
had
not
been
decided.
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
well,
i
think
arkansas
writers'
project
is
directly,
precisely
on
point
with
this
case,
and
it
is
a
direct
decision
in
this
case.
i
didn't
have
the
benefit
of
that
case
when
i--
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
--maybe
that
is
why.
and
i
think
i
got
there,
however,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
any
equal
protection
analysis
requires
the
achievement
of
a
legitimate
stadient
and
to
achieve
a
legitimate
stadient,
it
cannot
be
a
law
respecting
the
establishment
of
religion.
and
i
believe
that
in
addition
to
being
arkansas
writers'
project
versus
ragland
all
over
again,
this
case
is
also
a
law
respecting
the
establishment
of
religion
as
well.
now,
the
reason
why
i
arrived
at
that
argument
is
because
i
believe
both
of
them
are
correct.
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
for
what?
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
probably
not,
although
the
problem
with
crucifixes
and
all
other
religious
symbols,
that
they
are
delivery
of
a
message.
the
problem
is,
you
got
to...
it
is
clear
that
you
can't
subsidize
deliveries
of
messages.
now,
you
may
be
able
to
accommodate
conduct,
and
somewhere
physical
things
become
conduct
as
in
the
man
who
won't
work
in
the
munitions
plant.
now,
you
would
have
to
stop
and
say
is
that
conduct
or
is
that
a
message?
it
is
symbolic.
you
could
very
well
argue
that
the
crucifix
by
its
definition
is
a
statement
of
your
religious
principles
and
thus
is
a
delivery
of
a
message.
now,
you
have
to
accommodate
the
man
going
to
the
church
to
light
the
candle.
now,
how
about
buying
the
candle?
the
candle,
in
lighting
the
candle
may
be
conduct;
that
is,
has
to
be
accommodated.
but
it
doesn't...
but
when
it
is
the
message
and
delivering
the
message,
we
certainly
can't
subsidize
it.
now,
i'm
not
sure
how
you
deal
with
that.
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
two
points.
first,
the
arkansas
writers'
project
case
involved
an
arkansas
general
sales
tax
statute.
it
provided
a
taxation
of
all
tangible
property,
according
to
the
court's
opinion,
in
the
state
of
arkansas,
and
there
were
a
series
of
exemptions,
like
in
texas,
for
mules
and
various
things,
but
there
was
only
an
exemption
for
religious,
trade,
sports,
and
professional
journals.
so,
there
were
a
lot
of...
or
media,
i
suppose.
the
agricultural
magazines,
magazines
about
the
oil
and
gas
industry
or
other
things
were
subject
to
tax,
along
with
general
interest
magazines.
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
in
arkansas
they
exempted
newspapers.
that
was
a
separate
grounds
for
writ
petition
in
that
area,
in
the
appeal
in
that
case.
second...
and
thus,
this
case
is
similar
in
that
only
the
restriction
is...
does
not
include
sports,
professional
journals
and
trade
journals.
it
just
includes
religion,
one
of
the
five
topics
that
were
involved
in
the
arkansas
case.
and
there
the
evidence
was,
according
to
this
court's
opinion,
one
to
three
magazines
paid
the
tax.
in
our
evidence,
the
comptroller's
people
testified
that
20
to
30
paid
the
tax.
given
the
relative
size
of
arkansas
and
texas,
i
think
that's
a
distinction
without
a
difference
in
that
we,
in
fact,
have
as
few
as
20
of
the
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
magazines
that
are
circulated
in
texas
are
subject
to
tax...
not
because
of
the
exemptions,
because
of
the
enforcement
policy.
finally--
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
--our
enforcement
policy
argument
that
was
part
of
the
trial
court
evidence.
finally,
let
me
point
to
the
question
of
does
the
taxpayer
get
his
money
back.
and,
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
this
court's
opinions
about
taxpayers
contending
statutes
or
schemes
were
unconstitutional
for
interstate
commerce
reasons,
a
whole
range
of
reasons.
this
court's
armco
versus
hardesty
case
and
west
virginia
statute
taxing
certain
interstate
sales--
mr.
roger
james
george,
jr.
--well,
i
suppose
the
state
has
to...
if
it
has
a
statute,
it
can
repeal
it
and
then
solve
the
problem,
and
you
can't
repeal...
i
suppose
you
could
repeal
the...
there
is
no
equal
protection
in
commerce
clause.
obviously
you
can't
tax
it
because
in
commerce
you
can't
solve
it
by
corrective
legislation.
you
can
solve
this
by
corrective
legislation.
but
you
can't
solve...
courts
don't
have
powers
to
impose
taxes.
it
can't
go
out
and
make
those
people
who
distributed
the
watchtower
and
the
baptist
standard
and
the
methodist
layman
pay
the
tax
because
the
legislature
has
exempted
them.
thank
you.
