we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
87-1245,
texas
monthly
versus
bob
bullock.
mr.
george,
you
may
proceed
whenever.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
they
buy
it,
they
are
exempt?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
religion
clauses
don't
say
anything,
in
haec
verbis,
about
any
duty
to
accommodate.
i
can
see
how
that
would
explain
the
title
vii
accommodation
cases.
but
how
about
the
ones
that
are
based
purely
on
the
constitution?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
george.
ms.
burke,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
burke,
let
me
interrupt
you
just
a
moment.
does
the
state
have
any
statistics
as
to
what
the
amount
of
tax
that
might
be
collected
from
exempt
organizations
if
this
exempt
organization...
if
this
exemption
weren't
in
effect
compare
as
a
matter
of
percentage
with
the
amount
of
revenue
brought
in
by
the
state
sales
tax?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
any
figures
in
the
record
or
that
you
know
of
what
the
gross
revenue
from
the
state
sales
tax
is
in
any
given
year?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
burke.
mr.
george,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
may
be
somewhat
different
if
the
holding
rests
on
an
equal
protection
basis
than
it
does
on
a
commerce
clause.
because
our
case...
some
of
our
cases
have
said
when
it's
an
equal
protection
violation,
the
state
can
choose
whether
to
eliminate
the
favored
treatment
or
the
disfavored
treatment
and
just
make
sure
they're
all
treated
equal.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
george.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
87-1245
texas
monthly,
inc.
versus
bullock
will
be
announced
by
justice
brennan.
