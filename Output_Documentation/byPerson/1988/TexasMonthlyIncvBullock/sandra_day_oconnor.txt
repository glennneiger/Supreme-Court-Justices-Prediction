how
about
the
sale
by
a
church
of
a
religious
item,
a
bible
or
a
crucifix
or
something
of
that
sort?
is
there
an
exemption?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
is
that?
i
mean,
why
wouldn't
it
be
possible,
at
least,
if
you
were
to
prevail
that
the
tax
would
be
extended
by
texas
to
religious
periodicals--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--so
that
you
wouldn't
benefit
from
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr.
george,
i
take
it,
then,
if
the
exemption
here
applied
also
to
publications
sold
by
charitable
and
educational
institutions
as
well
as
religious,
you
think
that
walz
would
be
satisfied?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
burke,
you
don't
take
the
position
that
this
accommodation
is
required,
do
you,
by
the
free
exercise
clause?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
you
take
the
position
that
texas
may
not
impose
a
general
sales
tax
on
religious
publications?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
what
i'm
asking.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can
the
state
impose
its
sales
tax
on
the
sale
of
candles
in
a
catholic
church,
too?
