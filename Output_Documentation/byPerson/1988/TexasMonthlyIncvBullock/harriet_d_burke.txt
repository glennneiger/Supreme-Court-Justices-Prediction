ms.
harriet
d.
burke
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
the
position
of
the
state
of
texas
in
this
appeal
that
there's
been
no
violation
of
the
establishment
clause;
that
in
judging
this
exemption,
section
151.312,
it
should
be
viewed
on
a
violation
of
an
equal
protection
standard
and
not
a
standard
involving
violation
of
first
amendment
rights.
the
test
to
be
applied
should
be
one
of
a
rational
basis
test.
the
rational
basis
that
the
state
asserts
is
that,
one,
it
seeks
to
accommodate
religion
in
the
sense
of
being
neutral
towards
religion
and
helping
effectuate
the
free
distribution
of
religious
messages
by
a
religious
faith.
the
second
rational
basis
is
that
the
exemption
seeks
to
avoid
any
violation
of
the
establishment
clause.
the
third
basis
is
it
seeks
to
avoid
any
violation
of
the
free
exercise
clause
of
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution.
ms.
harriet
d.
burke
the
arkansas
case,
your
honor,
the
way
texas
views
the
arkansas
case
is
that
in
that
particular
case,
you
had
a
different
tax
structure
than
what
you
have
in
texas.
ms.
harriet
d.
burke
it
did
involve
the
issue
of
first
amendment
right,
free
press,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
harriet
d.
burke
texas
taxes
all
parts
of
the
press
except
for
religious
periodicals.
ms.
harriet
d.
burke
the
state
does
not--
ms.
harriet
d.
burke
--the
way
the
state
reads
arkansas
writers'
project
is
that
to
have
a
first
amendment
violation,
there
must
be
a
tax
that
singles
out
the
press
as
a
whole
and
targets
the
press
for
that
tax,
or
it
must
target
a
small
group
within
the
press.
and
then,
beyond
that,
you
look
to
content-based
discrimination.
if
that
is
not
the
way
the
arkansas
case
is
to
be
read,
then
we
must
be
judging
this
one
a
strict
scrutiny
approach.
however,
the
state
doesn't
see
that
texas
monthly
has
been
harmed
any
more
than
any
other
retailer
in
the
state
of
texas
having
to
pay
the
tax.
if
the
court--
ms.
harriet
d.
burke
--yes.
ms.
harriet
d.
burke
yes,
your
honor.
that's
the
way
the
state
views
it.
however,
if
the
court
does
not
view
it
in
that
manner
and
determines
that
a
strict
scrutiny
approach
should
be
applied
in
this
case,
the
compelling
state
interests
are
the
same
that
i
have
enunciated
as
being
rational
basis
to
sustain
the
exemption.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
if
the
court
so
determines
that
there
has
been
a
constitutional
violation,
the
state
would
request
the
court
to
invalidate
the
exemption,
leave
texas
monthly
subject
to
the
tax,
and
remand
the
case
to
the
trial
court
level
to
determine
whether
or
not
religious
periodicals
would
then
become
subject
to
the
tax
under
texas
law.
ms.
harriet
d.
burke
not
at
that
point
in
time,
your
honor,
until
a
decision
was
made
as
to
whether
religious
periodicals
become
subject
to
the
tax
because
under
the
current
tax
structure,
all
sales
of
tangible
personal
property
are
taxable.
all
property
brought
into
the
state
for
use
or
shipped
into
the
state
are
presumed
to
be
subject
to
the
tax.
therefore,
we
think
in
arguing
before
the
state
courts
that
the
intent
of
the
legislature
is
quite
clear
that
if
the
legislation
is
invalidated,
this
exemption
falls,
that
these
sales
will
become
automatically
subject
to
the
tax,
and
everyone
will
be
treated
equally
under
the
texas
tax
structure.
ms.
harriet
d.
burke
it's
an
unusual
procedure,
your
honor.
i
haven't
seen
this
argued
before,
but
it's
no
more
unusual
than
invalidating,
striking
down
the
entire
tax
system
here
just
because
you
have
one
exemption
from
an
otherwise
equal
tax.
all
retailers
of
publications
are
subject
to
the
tax
in
texas,
including
newspapers
for
this
period
of
time.
ms.
harriet
d.
burke
of
course,
your
honor,
there
would
be
a
limitations
time
period
running
against
the
state
on
necessities
taxes.
so,
the
state
would
not
be
able
to
go
back
and
assess
for
unlimited
time
periods.
ms.
harriet
d.
burke
no,
your
honor.
there
are
two
other
taxpayers
who
have
suits
now
pending
on
this
particular
issue.
ms.
harriet
d.
burke
the
statute
was
repealed
in
1987,
effective
october
1,
1987.
ms.
harriet
d.
burke
no,
your
honor.
there's
a
four-year
statute
of
limitations
in
texas.
ms.
harriet
d.
burke
yes,
sir.
four
years
from
the
time
the
taxes
become
due
and
payable.
ms.
harriet
d.
burke
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
state
would
be
subjected
to
having
numerous
refund
claims
filed
against
it.
depending,
of
course,
some
would
be
of
larger
amounts
than
others,
depending
on
how
the
court
rules
in
this
particular
case.
if
the
court,
though,
however
finds
that
the
tax
itself
should
be
struck
in
this
instance,
the
state
asks
the
court
to
remand
this
case...
not
with
regard
to
texas
monthly...
they
should
get
their
money
back,
but
to
determine
from
a
state
court
perspective,
let
the
state
court
determine
how
to
handle
the
refund
situation
that
might
be
occasioned
as
a
result
of
this
decision.
the
state,
though,
just
as
i
said
before,
does
not
view
this
as
a
first
amendment-type
issue.
what
we
have
here
is
an
exemption--
ms.
harriet
d.
burke
--no,
your
honor,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
and
i
do
not
have
that
kind
of
evidence
since
the
state
has
not
been
taxing
religious
organizations.
ms.
harriet
d.
burke
your
honor,
it
is
the
largest
revenue-raising
tax
in
the
state
of
texas.
last
year
alone
it
brought
in
about
two-thirds
of
the
taxes
that
were
being
paid
to
the
state
of
texas.
i
don't
have
a
dollar
figure
for
you,
but
it
is
a
substantial
tax
to
the
state
of
texas.
the
exemption
in
section
151.312
i
have
heard
been
called
basically
a
content-based
type
exemption.
the
state
would
characterize
it
more
in
the
nature
of
first
a
status-based
exemption.
the
first
decision
to
be
made
under
the
exemption
is
whether
or
not
the
periodical
is
being
distributed
or
published
by
a
religious
faith.
then,
the
second
part
of
the
exemption
deals
whether
it
wholly
contains
writings
promulgating
the
teachings
of
the
faith.
the
aim
of
this
exemption,
the
state
would
submit,
is
to
accommodate
religious
faiths
and
their
adherents
by
exempting
them
from
the
tax
on
their
publications
which
are
disseminating
the
teachings
of
the
faith.
it
allows,
therefore,
religion
to
advance
itself,
but
also
to
be
neutral
between
church
and
state.
so,
it's
more
of
an
activity-based
exemption
even
though
to
a
degree
you
must
look
at
content.
it
is
allowing
the
church
to
be
free
from
religious
restraints
in
disseminating
its
religious
messages.
ms.
harriet
d.
burke
i
believe
it
might,
your
honor.
i'm
trying
to
think
that
the
state
has
granted...
and
this
is
not
in
the
record...
that
the
state
has
granted
an
exemption
to
a
religious
faith
that
was
an
atheistic
organization.
ms.
harriet
d.
burke
yes,
it
is,
your
honor,
but
it
is
a
belief,
even
though
it's
anti-religion.
the
state
has
tried
to
extend
this
exemption
as
far
as
it
can.
ms.
harriet
d.
burke
yes,
in
a
sense.
ms.
harriet
d.
burke
yes,
but
the
state
has
tried
to
accommodate
religion
to
the
extent
that
it
can,
and
i
believe
i'm
correct
on
that.
ms.
harriet
d.
burke
how
do
you...
accommodation
is
by
allowing
the
organization
to
be
free
from
having
to
support
the
state.
it
is
maintaining
a
physical
neutrality
between
the
organization
and
the
state.
ms.
harriet
d.
burke
no,
unless--
ms.
harriet
d.
burke
--the
state
considers
atheism
to
be
a
form
of
faith.
ms.
harriet
d.
burke
the
state
legislature
did
make
a
deliberate
enactment
to
exempt
religious-type
periodicals
being
distributed
by
a
religious
faith.
ms.
harriet
d.
burke
your
honor,
as
i
understand
the
free
exercise
clause,
it
does
mandate
that
accommodation
be
required.
it's
not
just
permitted;
it's
required.
ms.
harriet
d.
burke
no,
your
honor.
i'm
not
saying
it
would
be
an
absolute
violation--
ms.
harriet
d.
burke
--to
impose
the
tax.
no,
that
is
not
the
position
of
the
state.
ms.
harriet
d.
burke
yes,
your
honor,
it
could.
ms.
harriet
d.
burke
and
the
state
is
certainly
not
asserting
that
it
would
be
an
absolute
violation
of
either
the
establishment
clause
or
the
free
exercise
clause
if
the
exemption
were
not
in
place.
they
recognize
that
rational
bases
have
to
meet...
be
drawn
under
the
statute.
with
regard
to
the
arkansas
tax,
texas
again
does
see
a
distinction
there
because
arkansas
did
tax
only
general
interest
periodicals
and
exempted
everything
else
from
the
terms
of
the
tax
including
newspapers.
texas
tax
structure
is
just
the
reverse.
it
taxed
all
publications,
including
newspapers,
but
exempted
only
religious
periodicals
from
the
terms
of
the
tax.
if
the
exemption
were
not
in
place,
as
i
have
said,
the
state
is
not
saying
that
the
rational
basis
is
that
there
would
be
a
violation
of
the
establishment
clause,
but
without
the
exemption
there
would
be
a
greater
involvement
between
the
church
and
the
state
in
the
sense
that
the
church
would
have
the
authority
to
be
subject
to
paying
the
tax,
have
an
obligation
and
duty
to
pay
the
tax,
and
if
it
did
not,
then
the
state
could
go
in
and
file
liens
against
church
property
if
there
was
a
delinquency.
it
could
seek
to
seize
the
church
property
and
sell
it
to
pay
a
tax
debt,
and
it
also
could
freeze
church
bank
accounts.
this
is
certainly
a
greater
involvement
between
the
church
and
the
state
than
if
the
exemption
were
not
present.
this
also
pertains
with
regard
to
the
free
exercise
of
religion.
if
the
exemption
were
not
present,
there's
a
possibility
of
a
violation
under
the
free
exercise
clause
in
that
it
has
previously
been
held
that
jehovah's
witnesses,
for
example,
going
out
and
disseminating
their
religious
messages
by
selling
publications
containing
their
religious
messages
when
they
were
required
to
pay
a
tax
and
obtain
a
license
before
they
could
engage
in
these
activities,
this
was
held
to
be
a
violation
of
their
free
speech
rights
and
also
a
violation
of
their
free
exercise
rights.
under
the
texas
sales
and
use
tax
act,
as
it
was
structured
during
the
time
period
in
question,
what
you
had
was
a
situation
that
engaged
in
operation
as
a
retailer
within
the
state
of
texas,
you
had
to
post
a
bond
first.
then
you
had
to
obtain
a
permit,
and
then
you
had
to
collect
and
remit
the
tax
or
remit
the
tax
to
the
state
of
texas.
without
the
exemption
in
place
there
is
a
possibility
of
a
violation
of
the
free
exercise
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
ms.
harriet
d.
burke
free
exercise
clause
grounds.
ms.
harriet
d.
burke
yes,
which
was
murdock
versus
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania.
ms.
harriet
d.
burke
yes,
your
honor,
they
were
directly
going
out
and
selling
their
watchtower
publications,
and
sometimes
they
were
receiving
donations
from
them.
but
that
would
fall
within
the
definition
of
a
sale
under
the
texas
sales
and
use
tax
act,
which
is
a
transfer
of
tangible
personal
property
for
a
consideration.
and
under
that
particular
case,
as
i
said,
it
was
a
general
regulatory-type
situation,
but
it
also
was
a
tax
that
was
being
imposed
upon
the
sale
of
these
magazines.
they
had
to
pay
the
tax
in
advance,
and
they
also
had
to
obtain
a
license,
and
this
is
pretty
much
the
same
structure
under
the
texas
sales
and
use
tax
act.
the
state,
therefore,
feels
that
it
has
asserted
either
rational
basis
or
compelling
state
interest
to
sustain
the
exemption
in
this
case.
texas
monthly
has
also
raised
the
fact
that
section
151.312
does
not
or...
they
say
it
does
constitute
a
law
respecting
establishment
of
religion.
the
position
of
the
state
is
that
the
lower
court
correctly
determined
that
this
exemption
does
not
fall
under
that
category;
that
it
meets
a
three-part
test
in
lemon
versus
kurtzman:
number
one,
that
it
has
a
secular
legislative
purpose
in
that
it
restricts
the
physical
relationship
between
church
and
state,
and
this
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
in
texas
so
determined.
it
also
held
that
its
primary
purpose
was
not
to
advance
or
inhibit
religion.
to
the
contrary,
the
effect
was
to
permit
religious
periodicals,
religious
organizations
in
effect
to
be
free
from
state
sponsorship
or
support.
and,
thirdly,
that
the
exemption
did
not
foster
an
excessive
entanglement
with
religion.
ms.
harriet
d.
burke
i
think
it's
a
test
that
should
be
applied,
your
honor,
in
this
case.
i
think
it
probably
should
not
be
so
rigidly
applied
in
this
type
of
context,
but
i
think
it
should
be
applied.
and
i
think
the
exemption
meets
all
elements
of
the
test
because
i
feel
that
it
doesn't
constitute
excessive
entanglement
with
religion
in
the
respect
that
it
doesn't
create
the
appearance
of
an
ongoing
partnership
between
church
and
state
that,
like,
say,
a
direct
aid
or
subsidy
would,
even
though
you
might
refer
to
an
exemption
as
being
a
subsidy.
certainly
it
has
been
held
in
the
past
that
determining
in
the
walz
case
that
real
property
being
exclusively
used
for
religious
purposes
didn't
constitute
an
excessive
entanglement
with
religion
and
also
determined
whether
secular
books
that
were
to
be
given
to
students
of
parochial
schools,
there
had
to
be
a
determination
made
there
as
to
whether
it
contained
religious
material
or
whether
it
was
secular
in
nature.
that
was
held
not
to
constitute
excessive
entanglement
with
religion.
what
the
state
is
doing
here
is
being
mutual
towards
religion.
it
is
trying
to
accommodate
religion
by
allowing
for
the
free
distribution
of
religious
teachings
and
materials.
it
is
not
advancing
or
inhibiting
religion,
it
is
a
secular,
legislative
purpose,
and
it
does
not
foster
an
excessive
entanglement
with
religion.
in
the
past
in
that
area
on
advancing
religion,
just
going
back
to
that
for
a
minute,
it
has
already
been
held
that
time-release
programs
where
students
that
were
released
from
public
schools
to
go
off
school
grounds
to
attend
religious
instruction,
that
this
type
of
program
did
not
create
a
symbolic
union
between
church
and
state
so
as
to
constitute
an
advancement
of
religion.
i
think
this
same
sort
of
approach
can
be
applied
to
tax
case
in
that
the
voluntary
sale
and
purchase
of
these
types
of
religious
periodicals
likewise
does
not
constitute
excessive
entanglement,
does
not
advance
religion.
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
under
the
texas
tax
structure
that
what
we
have
here
is
an
exemption
exempting
the
sales
of
religious
periodicals
based
on
content.
we
previously
said
we
don't
feel
that
the
whole
exemption
is
really
content-based.
it's
more
status-based
and
activity-based.
there
are
other
exemptions,
however,
in
the
texas
sales
and
use
tax
act,
one
of
which
is
an
exemption
that
allows
religious
organizations
and
other
organizations
to
make
one-day
sales
in
a
calendar
year
of
any
items
that
they
so
desire
to
sell.
and
i
realize
that
is
broader
based
than
just
the
religious
aspect.
but,
there's
another
exemption
that
permits
the
sale
of
food,
food
products
by
church
or
the
church
function,
and
that
can
occur
any
time
during
the
church
year.
so
there
are
other
exemptions
that
are
basically
religious-based
in
the
texas
sales
tax
act.
the
state
perceives
this,
as
i've
said
earlier
and
submits
to
the
court
that
what
we
have
here
is
a
nondiscriminatory
tax.
if
the
court,
however,
perceives
this
as
a
situation
where
there
is
content-based
discrimination,
a
strict
scrutiny
test
should
be
applied
and
the
exemption
should
be
upheld
under
this
type
of
test
because
what
we
have
here
is
two
competing
constitutional
interests,
the
right
to
free
speech
by
the
press
and
the
right
to
free
speech
by
religion.
and
to
avoid
any
violation
of
the
free
exercise
clause
or
the
establishment
clause
in
which
we
feel
a
compelling
state
interest,
we
submit
that
the
exemption
should
be
upheld.
thank
you.
