justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
this
case
is
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
of
texas.
the
question
we
have
to
decide
is
whether
a
texas
exemption
of
a
religious
periodical
from
texas
sales
taxes
promotes
religion
in
violation
of
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
from
october
1984
until
october
1987,
a
texas
"statute
exempted
from
sales
and
use
taxes
periodicals
published
or
distributed
by
a
religious
faith
consisting
holy
writings
promulgating
the
teachings
of
the
faith
and
books
consisting
of
holy
writings
sacred
to
a
religious
faith."
in
1985,
the
appellant,
a
publisher
of
a
general
interest
magazine
that
was
not
entitled
to
the
exemption
page
sales
taxes
under
protest
and
sued
to
recover
those
payments
in
state
court.
ruling
that
the
statutes
exclusive
exemption
for
religious
periodicals
promoted
religion
in
violation
of
the
establishment
clause.
the
state
court
struck
down
the
tax
as
applied
to
non-religious
periodicals
and
ordered
the
state
to
refund
the
tax
paid
by
appellant
plus
interest.
the
state
court
of
appeals
reversed
holding
that
the
exemption
satisfied
the
tripartite
test
of
our
decision
in
lemon
v.
curtsman
and
therefore
did
not
violate
the
establishment
clause.
our
judgment
reverses
the
judgment
of
the
texas
court
of
appeals
and
holds
that
the
exemption
does
violate
the
establishment
clause.
our
reversal
is
supported
by
three
opinions,
one
by
me
joined
by
justices
marshall
and
stevens,
another
by
justice
white,
and
the
third
by
justice
blackmun
which
is
joined
by
justice
o'connor.
justice
scalia,
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
justice
kennedy,
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
