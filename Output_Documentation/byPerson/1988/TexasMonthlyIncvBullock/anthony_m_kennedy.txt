justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
you
don't
claim
that
there's
an
unconstitutional
distinction
between
mules
and
this
magazine?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
does
the
state
concede
that
you
get
your
money
back
if
you
prevail?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
state
appellate
court
did
not
reach
this
issue,
just
the
state
trial
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
i
should
think
that's
an
issue
of
state
law
that's
not
before
us
and
that's
still
open?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
so,
then,
we're
not
certain
that
you're
going
to
get
your
money
back?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
do
we
often
make
decisions
that
have
no
meaning?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
the
message
of
the
arkansas
case?
that
was
just
a
freedom
of
the
press
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
it
was
a
free...
a
freedom
of
the
press
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
here
some
publications
are,
some
parts
of
the
press
are
taxed
and
some
aren't,
in
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
some
are
taxed
and
some
aren't--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--based
on
content.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
this
appellant
the
only
entity
that
has
filed
a
protest
on
this
theory?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
has
the
statute
run
as
to
all
others,
because,
i
take
it,
this
statute
has
been
repealed,
the
one
that
we're
looking
at?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
has
the
time
run
on
any
further
protests?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
four-year,
a
four-year
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
if
we
told
this
appellant
that
it
could
get
its
money
back,
then
any
number
of
others
could
file?
