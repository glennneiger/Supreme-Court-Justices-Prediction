chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
88-348,
new
orleans
public
service,
inc.
v.
the
council
of
the
city
of
new
orleans.
mr.
lee.
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
a
double
jeopardy
claim
then...
if
there
was
no
question
of
state
law
involved,
a
federal
court
should
be
able
to
intervene
prior
to
trial?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
you
said
just
a
minute
ago
it
would
come
out
the
same
way.
is
that
your
answer?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
do
you
mean
by--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--what
do
you
mean
by
mediation?
i
mean,
i
thought
the
reason
for
younger
v.
harris
was
the
idea
that
we
would
trust
state
courts
to
give
a
fair
interpretation
of
federal
constitutional
claims
as
well
as
state
claims.
i
didn't
think
mediation
was
any
big
reason
for
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
i
don't
think
any
of
the
opinions
say
that.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
then...
but
what's
your
position,
mr.
lee?
that
if
the
district
court
were
to
decide
on
the
merits
that
the
preemption
claim
was
correct,
then
it
should
go
ahead
and
decide
that?
with
no...
well,
what
preliminary
inquiry
do
you
make
to
decide
whether--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--well,
how
do
you
go
about
that?
i
mean,
that
is
not...
by
no
means
self-evident--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--from
the
phrase.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
does
"on
its
face"
mean?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that's
a
very,
very--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--nebulous
test.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
we're
in
this
court.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
lee,
what
was
the
non-adjudicatory
interest
of
the
state
in
younger
v.
harris?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
lazarus.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
is
the
state's
non-adjudicatory
interest
in
the
double
jeopardy
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
if...
but
if
the
state
proceeding
had
started
before
the
federal,
then
this
would
come
out
differently?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
what
is...
what
is
the
non-adjudicatory
interest
in
the
double
jeopardy
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
doesn't
the
state
have
the
same
interest
here
in
the
ongoing
processing
of
these
state
court
actions?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it's
not
true
of
trainor
against
hernandez,
moore
against
sims,
the
ohio
civil
rights
case.
certainly,
there
are
civil
cases
in
which--
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lazarus.
mr.
vince.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
vince,
you
rely
in
part,
i
think,
or
younger
v.
harris
in
that
line
of
cases.
but
that
generally
assumes
that
there
is
an
ongoing
state
proceeding
that
is
commenced
before
the
federal
action
is
going
to...
what
is
the
state
proceeding
here
that
you
say
was
commenced
before
the
federal
action
was
brought?
chief
justice
rehnquist
issued
by
the
city
council?
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
have
a
definition
of
mr.
lee's?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
wouldn't
look
at
any
statutes?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
then
how
does
facial
preemption
differ
from
other
kinds
of
preemption?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
wait
a
minute.
you're
talking
about
something
short
of
the
merits
and
yet
you
look
to
the
statute,
you
look
to
the
conflicting
orders.
how
is
that
different
than
a
determination
on
the
merits?
chief
justice
rehnquist
kind
of
a
time
question.
he
spends
15
minutes
and
if
it's
not
apparent
that
it's
not
facial--
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
vince.
mr.
lee,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lee.
the
case
is
submitted.
