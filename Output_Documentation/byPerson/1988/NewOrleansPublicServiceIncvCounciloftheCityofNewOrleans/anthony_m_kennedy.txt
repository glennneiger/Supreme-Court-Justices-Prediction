justice
kennedy
do
you
contend
that
you
were
entitled
to
federal
court
intervention
before
the
initial
state
hearing
was
concluded
here?
justice
kennedy
well,
under
that
analysis
do
we
give
any
deference
at
all
to
the
importance
of
allowing
state
procedural
and
adjudicatory
mechanisms
to
operate?
justice
kennedy
did
they
make
that
same
finding
as
to
the
agency?
justice
kennedy
did
they
make
that
same
finding
as
to
the
agency,
the
new
orleans
council?
did
that
have
a
good
track
record
too?
justice
kennedy
--how
is
that
any
different
from
exhaustion
of
remedies?
justice
kennedy
well,
it's
certainly
the
same
result
the
way
you
describe
it.
i
fail
to
see
the
difference.
