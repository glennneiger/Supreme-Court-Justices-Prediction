mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
is
no
question
under
this
court's
precedent
that
the
hypothetical
described
by
justice
o'connor
in
which
a
double
jeopardy
defense
was
raised
to
a
pending
state
criminal
prosecution
that
in
those
circumstances
abstention
would
be
warranted.
this
case,
we
believe,
is--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--in
the
double
jeopardy
case
you
have
an
ongoing
criminal
prosecution.
in
this
case
we
think
there
is
no
ongoing
state
proceeding
that
is
necessary
for
the
vindication
of
an
important--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--no,
no.
in
this
case
be
have
a
completed
administrative
proceeding.
and
then
we
have
three
pending
state
court
proceedings.
but
i
think
if
you
look
at
each
of
those
three
pending
state
court
proceedings,
you'll
see
that
they're
very
different
from
the
kind
of
proceeding
at
issue
in
younger
or
in
any
of
the
other
cases
in
which
this
court
has
upheld
younger
abstention.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
in
the
ongoing
enforcement
of
criminal
laws
in
the
state.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
because
you
have
to
look
at
each
of
the
three
state...
the
one,
for
instance,
there
is
a
nopsi
lawsuit
against
the
city
council.
let's
go
through
each
of
the
pending
state
proceedings
so
i
can
try
to
show
you
where
our
position
comes
out.
starting
with
nopsi's
own
lawsuit
against
the
city
council...
but
that
is
a
suit
which
is
not
brought
to
vindicate
a
state
interest.
nopsi
brought
that
suit
in
order
to
vindicate
the
integrity
of
ferc's
allocation
order.
it's
merely
protective
in
nature.
if
the
court
were
to
rule
that
that
was
a
basis
of
abstention,
this
case
would
be
a
mere
sport
because
in
the
future
utilities
such
as
nopsi,
would
not
initiate
such
protective
filing.
the
second
pending
state
proceeding
is
the
city
council's
lawsuit
against
nopsi
for
declaratory
relief.
but
we
believe
that
is
an
equally
unnecessary
proceeding
within
the
meaning
of
younger.
the
sole
purpose
of
that
proceeding
is
to
confirm
the
results
of
an
already
completed
administrative
proceeding
that
has
resulted
in
a
final
agency
order
with
legal
effect.
it
is,
therefore,
unlike
any
of
the
proceedings
in
which
this
court
has
upheld
younger
abstention.
there
is
no
ongoing
criminal
prosecution,
no
ongoing
nuisance
enforcement,
no
employment
discrimination
investigation.
the
sole
purpose
for
that
suit
for
declaratory
relief
is
to
have
the
state
courts,
rather
than
the
federal
courts,
determine
the
constitutional
issue.
and
in
that
way
it
really
is
most
like
the
type
of
first-right
collateral
litigation
that
younger
was
designed
to
discourage,
not
to
encourage.
finally,
there
is
the
suit
that
had
been
brought
by
the
alliance
for
affordable
energy
in
state
court.
but
that
suit,
too,
is
not
even
directed
immediately
at
nopsi.
the
city
council
is
the
defendant
in
that
suit.
nopsi
is
simply
a
third
party
defendant.
and
it
raises
the
wholly
secondary
question
of
whether
nopsi
should
have
been
denied
an
even
greater
share
of
grand
gulf
by
the
city
council.
that
entirely
secondary
state
law
issue
shouldn't
deny
nopsi
its
right.
and
then--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--and
i'm
suggesting
that
there
would
be
abstention
because
of
the
different
nature
of
the
proceedings.
there
would
be
abstention
in
that
case.
i
don't
think
he
meant
to
say
what
i
think
that
we--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--that's
right.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
that's
right.
and
there
was
an
ongoing
enforcement
action.
here
we
don't
have
that.
the
final
argument
is--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--there
are
civil
cases
which
the
court...
where
there
are
ongoing
enforcement
actions.
here
we
don't
have
that.
it's
completed.
the
final
argument
that
the
city
council
makes
is
that
you
should
assume
for
younger
purposes
that
the
city
council
administrative
proceedings
are
in
effect
ongoing
because
of
the
availability
of
subsequent
state
court
review.
we
think
that
simply
proves
too
much.
it's
burford,
and
not
younger,
that
describes
the
discrete
set
of
circumstances
where
the
working
relationship
between
state
courts
and
state
agencies
in
fashioning
state
policy
is
so
close
that
abstention
is
required.
burford
does
not
call
for
abstention
whenever
a
constitutional
challenge
is
brought
to
state...
completed
state
agency
action
which
is
subject
to
state
court
review.
burford,
instead,
provides
that
such
abstention
where
a
federal
claim
is
raised
is
warranted
only
if
two
factors
are
present,
neither
of
which
are
present
here.
first,
an
especially
close
working
relationship
between
state
courts
and
state
agencies
in
the
fashioning
of
state
policy,
and
second,
where
the
exercise
of
federal
court
review
will
require
the
resolution
and
inquiry
into
predominantly
local
factors.
neither
is
present
here.
there
are
no
expert
courts
or
specialized
courts.
we
simply
have
courts
of
general
local
jurisdiction
who
are
reviewing
the
city
council's
determination
not
de
novo,
as
in
burford,
but
under
the
substantial
evidence
test.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
we
pennzoil
we
had
an
ongoing
state
proceeding
and
we
had
a
state
court
that
was
enforcing
a
judgment
against
them.
and
it
was
attacking
the
proceeding
itself.
here
what
nopsi
is
challenging
is
the
administrative
proceeding,
not
the
ongoing
state
proceeding.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
here
we
had
an
ongoing
state
court
proceeding,
and
the
constitutionality
of
that
was
under
challenge,
an
aspect
of
it.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
actually,
we
wouldn't
be
in
the
pennzoil
situation
because
still...
i
think
it
would
be
a
very
different
case...
but,
still,
there
they
would
be
basically
challenging
what
the
city
council
had
done.
in
pennzoil
it
was
a
direct
attack
on
the
procedures
of
the
state
courts
themselves.
and
it
was
the
constitutionality
of
that
which
the
court
upheld
had
an
independent
adjudicatory
interest
that
was
sufficient.
turning
quickly
back
to
the
second
aspect
of
burford
abstention,
which
we
also
think
isn't
present
here...
but
it
is
burford
which
really
governs
these
kinds
of
cases.
there
is
no
predominantly
local
factor
that
needs
to
be
required
to
determine
the
federal
preemption
issue
like
there
was
in
burford
for
the
economic
due
process
issues
there.
this
court
reached
and
disposed
of
a
virtually
identical
preemption
claim
in
the
mississippi
power
&
light
case.
there
was
no
need
whatsoever
for
any
inquiry
into
the
predominantly
local
needs
of
the
different
operating
companies
as
there
was
in
burford
and
in
the
alabama
public
service
commission.
instead,
indeed
the
thrust
of
the
court's
opinion
in
that
case
was
that
it
was
appropriate
to
treat
the
four
operating
companies
as
a
system,
as
one
system.
and
it
was
appropriate
for
ferc
in
allocating
the
shares
of
grand
gulf
to
ignore
and
to
overlook
the
particular
needs
of
each
operating
company.
this
case
simply
does
not
depend
on
a
logical
application
of
younger
and
burford.
it
demands
a
dramatic
expansion
of
younger
at
the
expense
of
the
important
limitations
expressed
on
abstention
in
burford.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
to
the
extent
that
i'm
talking
about
younger
initially--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--our
initial
argument,
the
necessary
preceding
argument
is
independent
of
that
inquiry.
to
the
extent
that
it
doesn't
matter...
with
a
federal
preemption
issue
or
another
kind
of
constitutional
issue.
to
the
extent
that
i'm
talking
about
burford,
it
still
doesn't
require
it
because
all
you
really
need
is
to
determine
whether
resolution
of
this
particular
type
of
federal
claim
requires
inquiry
to
predominantly
local
factors.
and
we
think
under
the
federal
power
act,
as
a
general
class
that
won't
be
the
case.
there
may
be
federal
preemption
issues
which
could
be
raised
which
would
require
such
inquiry.
but
we
certainly
don't
think
it
is
here.
we
have
a
secondary
argument
which
is,
even
if
this
court
thinks...
which
is
outlined
in
our
brief...
that
there
is
a
younger-type
proceeding
that
abstention
would
still
not
be
warranted.
but
there
is
this
threshold
very
significant
other
argument,
and
that
is
that
there
is
really
no
proceeding
here
at
all
like
in
any
of
the
other
cases
in
which
this
court
has
upheld
younger.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
in
the
state
court.
yes,
it
could,
but
that's--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--if
the
state
court
beat
the
federal
court
to
the
issue,
then
we
might
have
a
res
judicata
problem
that
we--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--but
we
don't
have
here.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
no.
and
there
is
no
request
here
for
any
injunction
on
the
state
court
proceedings.
thank
you.
