mr.
clinton
a.
vince
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
principal
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
lower
federal
courts
should
be
required
to
step
in
and
review
state
ratemaking
decisions
which
are
subject
to
full
review
in
ongoing
state
court
proceedings
when
a
debatable
preemption
claim
is
raised.
justice
scalia
asked
about
the
relationship
of
the
pennzoil
case
to
our
present
case.
nopsi
here
is
seeking
a
utility
company
exemption
from
normal
state
court
review
in
much
the
same
way
that
pennzoil
or
texaco
sought
a
fortune
500
exemption
in
the
pennzoil
case
improperly.
in
pennzoil...
our
fact
pattern
is
considerably
stronger
in
favor
of
abstention
than
pennzoil.
in
pennzoil
the
lower
federal
courts
found
that
the
texas
state
courts
were
inadequate.
they
found
exceptional
circumstances.
they
found
irreparable
harm
on
the
basis
that
texaco
could
not
meet
a
$13
billion
bond.
in
our
case,
the
lower
federal
courts,
both
courts,
found
that
the
state
court
system
was
perfectly
adequate
to
handle
all
of
nopsi's
claims,
including
the
preemption
claim.
they
found
that
the
track
record
of
state
courts
in
louisiana
on
preemption
issues
was
very
good,
and
that
the
tract
record
nationally
on
preemption
issues
for
state
courts
was
very
good.
that
the
states
had
essentially
developed
the
narragansett
doctrine
that
is
the
core
filed
rate
doctrine
that
nopsi
relies
upon.
mr.
clinton
a.
vince
could
you
repeat
the
question.
mr.
clinton
a.
vince
yes,
your
honor.
the
federal
district
court
found
in
the
nopsi-won
case
that
specifically
that
the
city
council
was
acting
in
good
faith
at
a
point
when
nopsi
raised
the
issue
that
the
city
council
was
not
acting
in
good
faith.
and
there
has
never
been
in
this
case
an
argument
that
the
city
council
or
the
state
court
systems
have
been
acting
in
bad
faith
or
in
a
harassing
manner.
there
simply
has
been
no
exceptional
circumstance
argument
here,
your
honor.
in
pennzoil
there
were
private
litigants
and
so
texaco
argued
that
there
was
no
legitimate
state
interest.
here,
we
have
the
state
level
regulatory
body
directly
involved
in
the
conflict.
mr.
clinton
a.
vince
i
think
there
would
be
three
basic
state
interests,
if
i
understand
your
assumption
correctly.
the
first
state
interest
would
simply
be
that
the
state
courts
have
an
interest
in
governing
their
local
regulators
and
making
sure
that
they
make
correct
decisions,
particularly
if
there
is
a
preemption
claim.
if
there
is
a
preemption
claim
and
a
problem,
the
state
courts
should
be
allowed
to
address
that
and
develop
state
policy.
the
second
legitimate
interest,
i
believe,
would
be
the
profound
interest
that
the
state
has
in
local
ratemaking.
and
that
interest
exists
whether
or
not
nopsi
wins
on
the
merits
of
this
case.
the
third
interest
is
much
more
specific
to
our
case,
and
it
is
hotly
contested.
that
would
be
the
state
interest
in
making
sure
that
utilities
attempt
to
reduce
risks
to
local...
to
retail
customers
if
it's
reasonable
and
feasible
to
do
so.
mr.
clinton
a.
vince
your
honor,
if
only
the
federal
preemption
claim
remains,
the
state
still
needs
to
look
at
what
the
state
regulator
did
and
compare
that
to
what
the
federal
regulator
did.
and
that
is
a
balancing
and
there
is
a
legitimate
state
interest
in
conducting
that
balancing
and
putting...
allowing
the
state
to
put
its
own
house
in
order
on
that
subject.
mr.
clinton
a.
vince
but
more...
excuse
me,
your
honor.
i
would
just
put
a
tag
on
that
the
real
factor
here
is
that
your
assumption
is
present
in
our
fact
pattern.
that
is,
we
have
had
a
horror
story
in
terms
of
multiple
track
litigation.
when
nopsi...
nopsi
first
brought
its
preemption
claim
before
the
state
regulator
and
it
then
exited
the
state
system
when
it
got
an
adverse
ruling
and
brought
a
collateral
attack
or
tried
to
bring
a
collateral
attack
in
federal
court
on
the
identical
issue
but
in
isolation
of
the
administrative
record.
at
the
same
time,
it
pursued
all
of
its
other
challenges
to
the
rate
order,
the
state
challenges
in
the
state
court
system.
that
immediately
set
up
a
dual
litigation
track.
this
council
has
been
sued
three
times
in
federal
court
in
three
years,
with
20
major
motions,
continuous
appeals
up
to
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
clinton
a.
vince
your
honor,
if
you
assume
that
the
city
council
was
wrong,
that
still
is
a
matter
that
should
properly
be
addressed
in
the
state
court
system.
as
a
practical
matter,
there
is
a
very
debatable
issue...
at
least,
we
feel
there
is
and
the
lower
federal
courts
have
felt
so...
that
the
preemption
issue
is
not
the
lay-down
hand
that
the
government
and
nopsi
contend.
mr.
clinton
a.
vince
mr.
chief
justice,
that
would
be
a
two-part
answer.
there
is
a
generic
ongoing
proceeding
in
the
sense
that
all
you
have
now
is
the
lowest
echelon
order
of
the
state
in
the
form
of
the
local
rate
order.
mr.
clinton
a.
vince
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
the
ongoing
proceeding
would
be
the
fact
similar
to
younger,
that
this
can
still
be
reviewed
and
is
subject
to
judicial
review
in
the
state
court
system
where
the
state
courts
no
doubt
will
develop
additional
policy
on
this
point.
it
may
be
that
if
the
states
do
their
job
correctly
and
justice
o'connor's
assumption
is
exactly
right,
which
we
disagree
with,
the
state
courts
could
still
deal
with
that
and
this
matter
might
not
need
to
reach
this
door
step
at
all...
this
court's
doorstep.
as
a
practical
matter,
the
multiple
state
litigation
is
a
matter
of
concern
not
just
with
reference
to
this
local
controversy,
but
multiplied
across
the
country.
the
major
organizations
of
state
and
local
governments
and
the
major
national
organization
of
state
regulators
have
come
in
on
the
city
council's
side,
not
simply
to
all
date
our
position
on
the
merits,
which
they
agree
with,
but
they
are
concerned
about
a
much
larger
problem.
and
that
is,
state
regulators
with
limited
resources
having
to
immediately
face
a
multiple
litigation
track
any
time
that
a
competent
team
of
utility
lawyers
can
draft
a
federal
conflict
into
their
complaint.
that's
not
difficult
to
do
under
the
federal
power
act
which
is
essentially...
contemplates
dual
regulation,
dual
federal
/
state
regulation.
the
preemption
test
that
nopsi
gave
is
not
exactly
identical
to
ours,
but
they
fall
their
own
facial
preemption
test.
the
federal
district
court
here,
and
later
two
state
courts,
have
made
specific
findings
that
there
is
no
facial
preemption
in
this
case.
mr.
clinton
a.
vince
your
honor,
i...
yes,
i
believe
that
facial
preemption
should
be
determined
within
the
four
corners
of
the
ferc
order
in
the
four
corners
of
the
council's
orders
so
that
you
can
look
at
those
two
orders
and
see
with
relatively
little
assessment
that
there
is
a
clash.
mr.
clinton
a.
vince
yes,
your
honor.
the
relevant
statutes
would
have
to
be
looked
at
as
well.
mr.
clinton
a.
vince
because
basically
what
it
does
not
require
is
an
adjudication
of
the
merits
of
the
case
in
order
to
determine
whether
implicitly
there
has
been
some
violation.
and,
frankly,--
mr.
clinton
a.
vince
--i
believe
the
example
would
be
exactly
what
the
federal
district
court
did
in
our
case,
your
honor,
and
that
is
he
looked
at
the
federal
power
act
and
he
looked
at
the
two
orders
and
he
saw
no
direct
clash.
he
saw
that
the
council's
rate
order
was
ostensibly
guided
towards
something
that
was
allowable
under
the
federal
power
act
for
retail
ratemakers.
basically
the
question
you
pose
is
a
frustration
for
us
in
terms
of
saying
how
does
a
federal
district
court
draw
the
line?
we
know
here
there
is
something
less
than
facial.
but
how
does
he
draw
the
line
in
terms
of
a
strong
preemption
claim
or
a
red-hot
one?
we
know
that
any
utility
company
coming
in
with
a
preemption
claim
is
going
to
argue
that
it's
a
very
strong
claim.
if
there
is
no
facial
clash
that
can
be
discerned
with
relatively...
with
relative
ease
by
a
competent
jurist
at
the
federal
district
court
level--
mr.
clinton
a.
vince
--no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
so
much
the
time
of
how
long
it
takes
to
review
the
respective
orders.
i
think
the
matter
is
that
the
judge
does
not
need
to
go
through
a
full-fledged
look
at
the...
for
example,
the
administrative
record,
to
determine
what
it
really
was
that
the
council
did.
and
nopsi
here
makes
the
statement
and
made
the
allegation
in
their
complaint
in
this
case
that
there
was
no
set
of
facts
that
could
sustain
the
city
council's
order.
but
in
their
briefs
and
in
our
arguments
we
have
gotten
into
some
very
difficult
disputed
facts
that
really
should
be
sorted
out
in
the
state
court
system
before
the
consideration
of
the
merits
of
preemption
is
reached.
as
i
pointed
out
a
moment
ago,
the
concern
of
the
council
and
the
state
courts
involved
has
been
that
there's
been
much
more
than
simply
utility
company
hauteur
towards
the
state
courts
here.
there
has
been
a
very
real
disruption
of
a
state
regulator's
ability
to
function.
this
council,
whether
its
ruling
on
the
merits
ultimately
will
be
upheld
or
not,
was
sued
at
the
commencement,
during,
and
after
its
regulatory
proceeding
in
federal
court.
the
council
members
individually
and
personally
were
sued
for
a
billion
dollars
in
federal
court.
there
is...
there
comes
a
point
where
it's
much
more
sensible,
we
contend,
to
allow
a
single
track
to
proceed.
a
single
track
will
achieve
just
as
good
a
result,
it
will
be
fair
to
all
parties.
this
court
will
still
have
the
opportunity
to
vindicate,
if
it
wishes,
through
the
certiorari
process.
but
the
whole
question
of
multiple
litigation
and
depletion
of
resources
is
then
removed.
mr.
clinton
a.
vince
i
believe
that
it
is...
it
is
analogous
to
exhaustion
of
remedies
in
the
sense
that
there
is
an
ongoing
proceeding
that
the
company
should
become
involved
with
in
order
to
resolve
this
in
one
single
proceeding.
i
don't
feel
that
it
is
the
same
legal
doctrine
as
exhaustion.
mr.
clinton
a.
vince
well,
i
think
that
it
is
essentially
the
result
that
the
younger
and
huffman
line
of
cases
says
is
appropriate
in
younger-type
of
abstention,
your
honor,
where
there
is
the
ongoing
opportunity
for
judicial
review
in
the
state
court
system.
mr.
clinton
a.
vince
yes,
justice
stevens.
the
principal
state
case
that
is
deciding
the
very
issue
of
preemption
that's
been
raised
here
is
ongoing.
it's
been...
the
pre-trial
briefs
have
been
filed,
the
case
has
been
argued.
the
parties
agreed
on
a
post-argument
schedule,
and
that
has
been
delayed
with
the
agreement
of
both
parties
so
that
we
could
file
our
briefs
and
argue
this
case.
and
it
will
resume
immediately
and
presumably
be
resolved
within
the
next
several
months.
our
concern
is
that
nopsi
basically
has
pole-vaulted
out
of
the
ongoing
state
proceedings
with
its
preemption
claim
up
here
and
basically
in
their
briefs
present
a
rather
full
argument
on
the
merits
even
though
this
is
a
relatively
narrow
procedural
question
concerning
abstention.
mr.
clinton
a.
vince
absolutely,
your
honor.
the
track
record
in
terms
of
rates
was
this.
the
council
first
invited
the
company
to
come
in
when
they
were
making
their
initial
procedures
for
rates
and
invited
the
company
to
seek
interim
relief.
instead,
the
company
sued
the
council.
that
was
the
billion
dollar
lawsuit.
the
federal
district
court
conducted
a
preliminary
injunction
hearing
and
said
there
is
no
irreparable
harm
here,
and
told
the
company
to
go
back
to
the
council.
when
they
did
that,
the
council
gave
interim
relief.
then
the
council
entered
into
a
settlement
with
the
company
that
put
essentially
the
full
rate
package
into
effect,
minus
$51
million
that
the
company
voluntarily
agreed
to
absorb.
that
rate
has
been...
was
in
effect
all
during
the
pendency
of
the
prudence
investigation.
when
the
prudence
investigation
was
completed,
the
council
gave
a
ruling
that
for
a
ten-year
period
instead
of
being
able
to
collect
six
percent
increases
annually,
nopsi
would
only
be
able
to
collect
four
and
a
half
percent
rate
increases
annually.
so,
the
company
has
been
receiving
rate
relief
and
the
district
court...
federal
district
court
in
our
case
made
a
specific
finding
that
the
council
was
acting
in
complete
good
faith
on
this
point
and
using
everything
that
it
possibly
could,
all
reasonable
measures
to
keep
the
company
in
a
positive
cash
position.
to
conclude,
your
honors--
mr.
clinton
a.
vince
--if
they
had
granted
no
relief
at
all,
the
legal
position
would
not
be
different,
justice
stevens,
for
this
reason.
the
company
would
then
immediately
be
able
to
go
into
state
court
and
seek
an
indication.
and
the
case
that
i
would
give
you
that's
directly
on
point
is
the
louisiana
power
&
light
case
that
we
cited
in
our
brief,
which
is
the
sister
company
to
nopsi.
at
that
time
the
middle
district
was
considering
the
louisiana
application
for
grand
gulf
costs
at
the
same
time
that
the
council
was
in
litigation
in
federal
court
in
the
eastern
district.
both...
both
courts
not
only
abstained,
but
ruled
that
there
was
a
johnson
act
prevention
from
a
federal
court
considering
the
issue.
that's
since
been
overturned
by
the
fifth
circuit.
but
when
louisiana
power
&
light
was
forced
to
go
into
state
court,
they
got
a
$119
million
emergency
rate
relief
ruling
within
one
to
two
months,
which
demonstrates
that
the
state
court
system
here
is
not
broken,
it
is
able
to
handle
these
cases
if
there
is
viable
claim.
and
that
simply
brings
me
to
my
conclusion,
that
i
would
urge
this
court
not
to
accept
or
put
its
imprimatur
on
the
basic
essence
of
nopsi's
case.
and
that
is
that
the
federal
courts
are
going
to
be
the
protectors
of
federal
questions
and
that
state
courts
are
going
to
be
the
enemy
and
not
do
the
job.
here
the
track
record
in
louisiana
is
quite
good.
mr.
clinton
a.
vince
yes.
mr.
clinton
a.
vince
well,
justice
stevens,
let
me
clarify
that,
please.
our
position
is
that
if
there
is
facial
preemption,
the
federal
district
court
then
has
the
discretion
not
to
abstain.
but
it
is
still
within
the
federal
district
court's
discretion.
mr.
clinton
a.
vince
i
think
it
would
seriously
diminish
our
argument,
justice
stevens.
but
the
example,
again,
that
i
would
give
is
in
the
younger
case.
the
criminal
syndicalism
statute,
or
one
very
similar
to
the
one
considered
in
younger,
was
actually
deemed
invalid
in
the
brandenburg
case
which
occurred,
i
believe,
19
months
earlier.
and
yet
the
court
felt,
even
though
there
was
a
substantial
possibility
that
the
statute
was
invalid...
they
still
felt
that
abstention
under
those
circumstances
was
appropriate.
mr.
clinton
a.
vince
that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
but
i
think
the...
the
point
is
that
the
state
courts
here
are
adequate
to
give
this
type
of
relief
and
that
there
are
not
the
type
of
exceptional
circumstances
that
might
exist
in
a
civil
rights
case
or
a
case
that
simply
is
not
present
here.
