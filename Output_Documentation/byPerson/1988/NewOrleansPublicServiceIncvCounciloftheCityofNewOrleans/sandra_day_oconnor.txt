justice
o'connor
mr.
lee,
what
if
we
had
before
us
a
state
criminal
case
and
the
defendant
raises,
for
example,
a
federal
constitutional
double
jeopardy
claim
and
says
the
state
has
no
right
to
try
him
at
all,
and
that
issue
would
be
completely
dispositive
of
the
state's
right
to
try
the
case.
we
abstain,
typically,
in
those
cases--
justice
o'connor
--in
the
federal
court.
justice
o'connor
how
is
that
different
from
your
case?
justice
o'connor
i
don't
see
how
that
fits--
--that's
not
true
in
double
jeopardy.
--the
double
jeopardy
claim
though.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
lee,
there
is
no
question,
is
there,
that
the
louisiana
courts
could
decide
that
preemption
issue?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
is
the
preemption
question
were
an
open
one?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
lazarus,
i
thought
mr.
lee
suggested
in
the
criminal
case
i
posed
of
the
pure
double
jeopardy
claim
that
maybe
there
shouldn't
be
abstention.
justice
o'connor
well,
if
there
is
only
the
federal
claim
of
preemption
presented
and
there
is
no
undecided
issue
of
state
law
at
all
remaining...
just
make
that
assumption...
then
what
is
the
comity
based
interest
that
says
the
federal
court
should
abstain?
justice
o'connor
well,
you
strayed
from
my
assumptions
in
your
response.
but,
it
is
difficult
to
understand
that
strong
state
interest
remains
if
the
assumption
is
that
only
the
federal
preemption
claim
remains.
justice
o'connor
--well,
that's
understandable,
perhaps,
if
the
city
council
persists
in
trying
to
trap
the
costs.
i
mean,
that
gets
into
the
merits
of
the
case.
but
i
don't...
i
don't
see
that
that
should
resolve
the
abstention
question.
