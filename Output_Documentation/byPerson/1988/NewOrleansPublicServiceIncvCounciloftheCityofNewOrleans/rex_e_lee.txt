mr.
rex
e.
lee
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
an
abstention
case.
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
properly
abstained
from
deciding
a
threshold
preemption
challenge
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
respondent,
city
council,
to
consider
disallowing
in
its
retail
rates
wholesale
costs
that
have
been
determined
by
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission.
the
short
reason
why
the
fifth
circuit's
judgment
must
be
reversed
is
that
that
judgment
is
based
on
an
abstention
standard
that
everyone
sitting
at
the
council
table
today
agrees
was
wrong.
but
we
all
phrase
it
a
little
differently,
all
three
of
us.
the
petitioner,
respondents,
and
the
government
are
in
basic
agreement
concerning
the
preliminary
assessment
that
a
federal
court
should
make
in
deciding
whether
to
abstain
in
a
preemption
case.
frankly,
i
think
the
respondents
say
it
best.
twice
in
their
brief,
at
page
25
and
again
on
page
30,
they
reiterate
that
the
responsibility
of
a
federal
court
in
deciding
whether
to
abstain
from
deciding
a
preemption
claim
where
there
is
a
pending
state
court
proceeding
is
to
decide
whether
the
federal
issue
is
facial,
direct,
readily
apparent,
and
dispositive.
very
frankly,
very
simply,
the
fifth
circuit
simply
did
not
do
that.
though
the
court
did
not
formally
reach
the
preemption
issue,
any
objective
reading
of
its
opinion
leaves
no
doubt
that
it
regarded
the
federal
preemption
issue
as
controlling
and
correct
and
of
a
quality
that
placed
the
council's
prudence
inquiry,
in
the
language
of
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion,
beyond
the
council's
retail
ratemaking
authority.
what
the
fifth
circuit
has
held,
therefore,
is
that
abstention
is
required
even
where
the
preemption
claim
deprives
the
state
of
jurisdiction
and
regardless
of
how
correct
and
dispositive
the
preemption
claim
must
be.
the
net
effect
of
that
holding
is
to
overrule
this
court's
consistent
decisions.
but
one
of
the
three
prerequisites
for
younger
v.
harris
abstention
is
the
existence
of
a
substantive
state
interest...
something
apart
from
an
adjudicatory
interest...
which
would
be
infringed
if
the
federal
court
were
to
decide
the
federal
issue.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
is
different
in
this
crucial
respect,
justice
o'connor,
and
the
answer
to
that
question
is
pivotal
to
this
decision
because
i
am
well
aware
of
the
post-younger
cases
that
have
involved
that
kind
of
constitutional
challenge
to
a
state
proceeding.
on
at
least
three
separate
occasions
subsequent
to
younger
v.
harris,
the
court
has
reiterated
and
each
time
has
made
a
little
more
explicit
what
was
really
said
in
younger
v.
harris
itself.
and
that
is,
that
one
of
the
reasons...
i
think
the
reason...
for
younger
v.
harris'
abstention
is
that
it
gives,
in
those
constitutional
challenge
cases,
an
opportunity
to
the
state
court
to
place
a
narrowing
construction
on
the
state
statute
in
such
a
way
that
it
will
mediate
between
state
and
federal
interests.
now,
the
classic
example
of
where
that
is
possible
is
when
you
have
such
state
statutes
as
were
involved
in
these
post-younger
v.
harris
cases,
such
as
obscenity
statutes,
criminal
syndicalism
statutes,
lawyer
disciplinary
proceedings.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
with
a
double
jeopardy
claim
even
so,
there
is
still
the
possibility
that
the
state
court
might
be
able
to...
depending
on
the
circumstances
of
the
case...
that
you
might
be
able
to
have
a
narrow
construction.
now,
in
the
event
that
in
the
particular
instance
there
was
not
the
opportunity
for
mediation
because
of
a
narrowing
construction,
then
i
would
say
it
should
come
out
the
same
way
as
here.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
would
depend
so
much.
it
is,
after
all,
realty
a
balancing
test.
what
you
really
have
to
look
at--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--in
the
event...
yes.
in
the
event...
in
the
event
that
there
were
no
opportunity
for
mediation
by
narrowing--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--by
the
narrowing
of
the
statute.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
i
submit,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
that
really
is
said
in
moore
v.
sims,
perhaps
most
prominently,
in
pennzoil,
and
in
trainor
v.
hernandez.
and
the
notion
that
state
courts
ought
to
be
able
to
decide
these
federal
issues
as
well
as
federal
courts
can
is
certainly
one
of
the
underpinnings
of
younger
v.
harris,
but
it
is
not
the
only
one.
another
one
is
that
there
must
be...
and
the
court
has
consistently
said
that,
and
it
is
reiterated
again
in
pennzoil
that
it
is
more
just
an
adjudicatory
interest,
more
than
just
an
interest.
in
the
state
courts
deciding
cases
that
are
before
it,
there
must
be
a
substantive
interest.
now,
in
this
case,
the
petitioner...
excuse
me,
the
respondents
suggest
two
such
interests.
the
first
is
an
interest
in
retail
rate
regulation,
which
is
certainly
important
to
states.
but,
it
simply
is
not
at
stake
in
this
case
because
out
of
the
total
package
of
constituent
elements
that
go
into
retail
rate
regulations,
such
as
determining
rates,
the
rate
of
return,
what
the
rate
base
ought
to
be,
and
so
forth,
the
only
component
that
this
federal
suit
would
carve
out
and
remove
from
the
state's
jurisdiction
is
the
very
one
over
which
the
council
has
no
jurisdiction
anyway.
the
other
state
interest
that
is
advanced
is
this
one
in
setting
the
state's
own
house
in
order.
that
is
nothing
but
an
exhaustion
of
state
remedies
argued,
which
the
court
has
consistently
rejected.
and
it
proves
too
much
because
school
desegregation
actions,
for
example...
and,
indeed,
i
think
virtually
every
section
1983
suit
will
inevitably
involve
allegations
of
wrongdoing
by
local
governmental
officials.
surely,
the
federal
courts
are
not
required
to
bar
the
courthouse
door
to
those
kinds
of
suits
in
order
to
permit
the
state
to
set
its
own
desegregation
and
civil
rights
violation
house
in
order.
the
other
basis
on
which
the
fifth
circuit
held
in--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--what
we
say,
justice
scalia,
is
almost
that,
but
not
quite.
but
in
the
final
analysis,
it
must
be
a
balancing
test,
that
you
have
to
see
to
what
extent
federal
interests
are
really
involved
and
to
what
extent
state
interests
are
really
involved.
younger
v.
harris
itself
said
that
what
we
need
is
a
sensitivity
to
the
legitimate
interests
of
both
state
and
national
governments.
and
among
the
factors
to
be
taken
into
account
are
these
that
i
said.
but,
in
this
instance,
the
case
is
clear
because
we
come
into
court
not
with
a
blunderbuss
but
with
a
rifle
and
the
one
issue,
what
you
have...
what
is
being
reviewed
here
is
a
fifth
circuit
judgment
that
assumed
we
were
right
on
the
preemption
issue.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
there
is
absolutely
no
question
about
that,
justice
o'connor,
and
i
think
that
that
poses
the
issue
very
neatly
because
if
the
fifth
circuit's
judgment
is
upheld,
then
the
rule
for
abstention
cases
will
be
that
abstention
is
proper
whenever
a
state
court
can
decide
the
federal
issue.
that
is
not
the
law,
has
not
been
the
law,
and
should
not
be
the
law
because
it
makes
a
judicial
comity,
a
street
that
runs
only
in
one
direction
and
does
not
take
into
account
the
competing
federal
interests.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
it
is
easier,
justice
kennedy,
once
it
has
been
concluded,
for
reasons
that
will
be
developed
more
by
mr.
lazarus.
but
we
would
have
been
entitled
to
abstention
in
the
earlier...
in
the
early
phase.
we
agree
in
this
respect
with
the
ninth
circuit,
that
in
most
cases
where
the
sole
issue
before
the
federal
court
is
preemption,
a
decision
to
abstain
is
necessarily
a
ruling
on
the
merits.
and
the
reason
is
this:
the
controlling
inquiry
under
burford
is
whether
the
issues
are
predominantly
local,
and
under
younger
v.
harris
it
is
whether
there
are
legitimate
state
interests.
a
ruling
that
the...
that
there
are
predominantly
local
interests,
or
that
there
are
legitimate
state
interests
is
necessarily
a
ruling
that
there
is
no
preemption,
because
if
there
were
preemption,
then
federal
law
would
trump
and
there
would
be
no
state
issue
and
no
state
interests.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
of
course
we
do.
but
that
is
strictly
an
adjudicatory
interest,
and
the
court
is
already
past
the
point
of
deciding
whether
adjudicatory
interests
alone
are
enough
to
do
the
job.
and
every
member
of
the
court
in
pennzoil
said
that
they
were
not.
moreover,
much
more
is
at
stake
in
this
case
than
whether
nopsi's
ferc-mandated
costs
are
to
be
honored
in
its
retail
rates.
at
issue
in
this
case
is
nothing
less
than
whether
judicial
comedy
really
is
a
two-way
street
or
whether
it
favors
only
state
courts.
the
crucial
fact
is
that
the
fifth
circuit...
this
is
an
abstention
case.
it
is
not
a
preemption
case,
and
the
court
need
not
and
should
not
reach
the
merits
of
the
preemption
issue.
the
reason
is
that
the
fifth
circuit
has
abstained
on
the
broadest
possible
ground.
what
it
has
said
is
we
agree,
in
effect.
we
assume
that
the
preemption
is
argument
is
correct.
and
notwithstanding
that
assumption,
and
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
that
preemption
argument,
if
correct,
deprives
a
state
court
of
jurisdiction
to
proceed
at
all,
it's
still
abstained.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
then
it
would
be
harder.
but
the
federal
court
at
least...
at
least...
should
make
this
preliminary
assessment.
but
what
you're
dealing
with
here
is
a
judgment
that
held,
in
effect,
that
abstention
is
required
whenever
the
federal
issue
can
be
raised
in
a
pending
state
proceeding.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
basically
the
same
one
the
respondents
are
talking
about
and
what
most
of
the
lower
courts
have
said,
which
is
that
you
make
a
preliminary
assessment
to
determine...
something
like
the
quick-look
doctrine
in
antitrust.
now--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well...
well--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--it
is
easy
in
this
case.
it
is
easy
in
this
case
because
in
this
case
the
fifth
circuit
had
no
difficulty
assuming
at
the
outset
that
we
were
right
on
our
preemption
claim.
but,
in
most
instances,
what
you
would
do
is
to
determine
whether
that
claim
is
substantial.
whether
on
its
face--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
whether...
whether...
perhaps
"on
its
face"
is
not
the
right
word.
as
a
preliminary
first
look
matter,
whether
it
has
some
merit.
and
i
would
simply
point
out
in
that
respect--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--no,
but--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--but
the
courts
of
appeals
have
had
no
difficulty
dealing
with
them.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
understand.
but
all
i'm
saying
is
that
the
experience
of
those
courts
of
appeals
teaches.
instances
are
cited
in
our
reply
brief
where
what
the
courts
of
appeals
have
done
is
to
make
this
first
look
and
then
often
after
they
decide,
yes,
this
preemption
challenge
needs
to
be
considered,
they
eventually
conclude
that
indeed
they
should
abstain
because
the
total
balance
of
factors
after
they
look
at
it
as
a
total
matter
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
they
should
abstain.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
we're
saying--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct.
and
there
will
be
instances,
justice
scalia,
in
which
it's
going
to
be
a
hard
decision
to
make
and
which
is
not
going
to
be
an
easy
one.
but
this
one
is
easy,
and
in
this
case
affirmance
of
this
judgment
on
the
ground
that
it
was
handed
down
by
the
fifth
circuit
would
open
a
gaping
hole
in
the
ability
of
the
federal
courts
to
enforce
federal
rights
across
a
broad
range
of
issues,
including
1983--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
if
you
want
to--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes.
yes,
but
if
you
wanted
to
adopt
a
categorical
test,
then
you
would
simply
say
that
if
the
claim...
if
the
claim
has
been
made,
then...
and
if
it
isn't...
if
it
isn't
rejectable
on
its
face,
then
federal
courts
are
there
to
decide
federal
issues
and
they
ought
to
decide
that
one.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
oh,
it
was
in
this
narrowing...
this
narrowing
construction
that
the
state
might
be
able
to
give
to
its
own
criminal
syndicalism
statutes
and
thereby
mediate
between
state
and
federal
interests.
i'd
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
just
briefly,
mr.
chief
justice.
a
few
items.
first
of
all,
justice
stevens,
what
mr.
vince
told
you
is
substantially
correct.
we
are
at
the
present
time
not
collecting
one
million
dollars
per
month
in
ferc-mandated
costs,
but
we
have
been
assured
by
the
city
council
that
if
we
win
this
lawsuit,
then
those
amounts
can
eventually
be
recovered.
now,
i
want
to
stress
that
this
question
of
whether
the
preemption
issue
is
debatable
or
not
really
isn't
relevant
in
this
particular
case
because
of
the
nature
of
the
fifth
circuit's
holding.
they
agreed
with
us
that
it
was
correct,
but
still
abstained.
in
other
instances...
not
this
case...
the
court
will
have
to
make
an
inquiry
into
the
substantial...
whether
it
is
substantial.
but
that
is
the
kind
of
inquiry
that
federal
courts
make
on
a
regular
basis
in
deciding
the
pendent
jurisdiction
claims.
we
agree
that
there
should
be--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
what
you're
reviewing
is
the
fifth
circuit's
abstention
judgment.
and
it
was
clearly
wrong.
it's
the
fifth
circuit,
if
there
is
any
question
about
it,
that
ought
to
make...
ought
to
make
that
threshold
inquiry.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
their
abstention
standard
was
wrong.
we
agree
with
the
single
track
proposition.
but
where
the
preemption
claim
disposes
of
the
whole
case
and
can
be
decided
without
inquiry
into
any
state
law
or
any
facts
that
are
set
before
the
state
administrative
body,
then
it's
the
federal
court
that
ought
to
decide
it.
and
in
this
case,
justice
o'connor,
i
really
think
this
case
is
your
hypothetical
because
the
only
argument
in
the
federal
complaint
is
that
this
case
is
preempted
and
it
deprives
the
state
of
jurisdiction.
and
what
you
are
reviewing
is
a
fifth
circuit
judgment
that
requires
abstention
even
where
there
is
no
jurisdiction.
what
the
case
really
comes
down
to...
what
the
case
really
comes
down
to
is
a
rule
that
requires
abstention
under
younger
v.
harrison
only
one
single
showing,
and
that
is
the
pendency
of
the
state
court
proceeding.
it
is
a
rule
that
is
squarely
inconsistent
with
the
non-exhaustion
state
remedies
argument.
there
is
no
basis
for
distinguishing
the
number
of
cases
that
have
held
that
there
is
no
requirement
of
state
exhaustion
from
the
holding
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case,
and
that
judgment
has
to
be
reversed.
thank
you.
