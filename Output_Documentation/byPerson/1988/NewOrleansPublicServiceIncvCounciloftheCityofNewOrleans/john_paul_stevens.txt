justice
stevens
mr.
vince,
refresh
my
recollection.
what
is
the
posture...
present
posture
of
the
various
state
proceedings?
are
any
of
them
about
to
be
decided?
justice
stevens
and
what
is
the
rate
structure
right
how?
did
they
get...
have
they
gotten
any
relief
in
the
matter
of
rates
or
is
that--
justice
stevens
--may
i...
if
you're
about
to
conclude,
may
i
ask,
would
those
findings
be
necessary
to
sustain
your
theory?
supposing
they
had
granted
no
relief
at
all,
your
legal
position
wouldn't
be
any
different,
or
would
it?
justice
stevens
it
is
critical,
your
position,
is
it
not,
that
the
preemption
issue
is
debatable?
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
i
have
some
of
the
same
difficulty
that
chief
justice
did,
with
the
concept
of
facial
preemption.
it
seems
to
me
it's
either...
you
know,
you
feel
very
strongly
that
the
issue
isn't
all
that
hard
or
it's
very
debatable.
and
maybe
that's
the
difference,
whether
it's
the
degree
of
difficulty
of
the
issue.
it
seems
to
me
you
do
rest
on
a
case
in
which
there
is
a
debatable
issue
of
preemption.
if
we
thought
it
was
clear-cut
the
other
way,
your
argument
would
really
not
be
quite
so
strong.
justice
stevens
yes.
of
course,
at
that
time
the
fact
that
it
was
a
criminal
case
was
more
important
than
maybe
it
is
today
here.
