justice
scalia
excuse
me.
doesn't...
in
the
context
of
a
1983
suit
or
a
federal
civil
rights
suit,
doesn't
your
thesis
also
prove
too
much?
do
you
say
that...
do
you
say
that
when
there
is
a
state
interest
involved,
when
there
is
a
possibility
of
a
state
statute
being
interpreted
in
a
certain
fashion
that
a
federal
court
must
abstain
in
civil
rights
and
desegregation
in
1983
situations
as
well?
justice
scalia
mr.
lee,
you're
saying
it
is
not
enough
if
the
federal
court
satisfies
itself
that
there
is
some
state
substantive
interest
involved
outside
of
the
adjudicatory
interest?
justice
scalia
you
have
to
weigh
whatever
state
substantive
interest
there
is
against
the
federal
preemption
interest?
is
that
your--
justice
scalia
--well,
this
one
is
easy,
you
say,
if
we
adopt
the
test
that's
a
hard
test
to
apply.
i
mean,...
but
the
issue
before
us
is
whether
we
ought
to
adopt
the
test
that's
a
very
hard
test
in
the
ordinary
case
to
apply,
or,
rather,
adopt
the
more
categorical
test
that
goes
one
way
or
the
other
and
let
congress
fiddle
with
the
niceties
that
you
want
to...
you
want
to--
justice
scalia
--by
these
balancing
tests.
justice
scalia
--now,
how
do
you
fit
pennzoil
into
this?
justice
scalia
you
mean--
justice
scalia
--you
mean
if
the
state
court
proceeding
here
had
proceeded
to
the
point
where
there
was
an
order
issued
and
then
the
federal
court
was
asked
to
set
aside
that
order,
we'd
be
in
the
pennzoil
situation?
justice
scalia
does
your
argument
assume,
mr.
lazarus,
that
we
agree
that
there
is
no
substance
whatever
to
the...
to
the
assertion
that
the
utility
here
could
have
complied
with
the
federal
requirements
of
ferc
and
nonetheless
done
what
the
municipality
here
wanted
it
to
do
by
reselling
the
power
it
was
committed
to
take?
justice
scalia
yes.
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
then
all
you're
asking
us
to
do
is
to
send
it
back
to
ask
the
fifth
circuit--
justice
scalia
--to
decide
whether
it's
clear
or
not?
justice
scalia
you're--
justice
scalia
--it
was
clearly
wrong.
it
was
clearly
based
on
the
wrong
reason,
you're
saying?
justice
scalia
it
might
still
be
right.
