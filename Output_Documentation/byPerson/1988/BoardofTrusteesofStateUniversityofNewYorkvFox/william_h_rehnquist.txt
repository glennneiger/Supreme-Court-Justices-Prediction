justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now,
no.
87-2013,
board
of
trustees
of
the
state
university
of
new
york
v.
todd
fox.
mr.
sherwood,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
they
don't
have
a
tupperware
party,
they
could
go
to
the
movie.
it
isn't
as
if
they
were
going
to
study
for
sure,
if
they
didn't
have
a
tupperware
party?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sherwood.
mr.
reath,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
reath.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
that
take
it
out
of
the
commercial
speech
category?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and,
that
is
your
position
here,
that
this
is
not
a
commercial?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
would...
that
would
totally
obliterate
the
difference
between
commercial
speech
and
what
you
refer
to
as
core
speech--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
haven't
finished.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there's
always
going
to
be
a
listener
for
any
commercial
speech.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
why
should
it
be
limited
to
one
on
one?
why
can't
it
be
a
right
to
listen
to
a
sound
truck
along
with
thousands
of
other
people?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
other
instances
are
involved?
i
thought
your
answer
to
justice
scalia
was
that
the
only
area
in
which
this
regulation
was
actually
applied
was
to
prevent
this
tupperware
party?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
who
is
this...
you're
seeking
to
give
legal
content
to
this
regulation
by
the
trial
testimony
of
whom?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
there's
no
overbreadth
doctrine
in
commercial
speech.
so,
no
matter
what
this
regulation
might
have
barred,
that
never
actually
happened.
if
it
can
properly
bar
a
tupperware
party,
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
justice
marshall
is
asking
about
stock,
securities--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--stock,
securities.
not
security...
securities.
stocks
and
bonds?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you
mr.
reath.
mr.
sherwood,
you
have
one
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
the
case
is
submitted.
