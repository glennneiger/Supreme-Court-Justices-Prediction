justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
justify
almost
any
rule,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
i
mean,
limiting
the
number
of
people
who
come
onto
campus
would
justify
almost
any
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
telling
me
you
let
people
come
on
campus
for
no
reason,
but
you
will
not
let
them
come
on
for
this
reason?
that
helps
your
security?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
just
don't
see
how
this
furthers
security
at
all.
if
you
had
rules
only,
only
the
following
categories
of
people
are
able
to
come
on
to
campus,
then
i
could
see,
excluding
this
category
is
for
security
reasons.
but,
as
far
as
i
understand
the
state
system,
anybody
can
go
on
campus,
so
long
as
he
goes
there
for
no
reason.
but,
if
he
happens
to
come
for
this
particular
reason,
he
can't
go.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
furthers
security
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
includes
eliminating
commercialism,
in
and
of
itself?
you
want
to
retain
the
ivy-hall
character
of
the
place,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
want
to
have
the
campus
a
place
not
where
business
is
done,
but
where
academic
pursuits
are
pursued.
justice
antonin
scalia
and,
not
even
all
commercial
speech?
you
make
exceptions
for
cultural
events,
for
dry
cleaning,
for
laundry,
for
banking,
barber,
beautician?
i
think
you
have
to
say
there's
some
content
discrimination
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
once
they
saw
how
it
applied,
did
any
of
these
intervening
plaintiffs...
was
any
of
them
turned
down
in
their
attempt
to
get
a
lawyer?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
their
attempt
to
get
a
doctor,
or
anything
like
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
yeah,
i'm
talking
about
the
other
ones.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
the
only
actual...
the
only
actual
application
of
this
regulation
that
we
have
before
us,
is
preventing
the
tupperware
part?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
his
title?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
his
title?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
have
even
a
greater
problem
than
that.
i'm
not
even
sure
that
if
you
call
it
a
non-commercial
speech
case,
by
seeking
to
interpret
the
regulation
that
way,
it
makes
it
such.
i'm
not
sure
that
our
commercial
speech
cases
are
doctrine...
that
you
cannot
raise
overbreadth
in
commercial
speech
cases.
i
think
it
looks
to
who
the
plaintiff
is.
if
the
plaintiff
is
complaining
about
the
restriction
of
his
commercial
speech,
that
kind
of
a
plaintiff
cannot
use
other
hypothetical
situations
in
justification
of
his
claim.
and,
you
have
here,
a
plaintiff
who
is
clearly
complaining
about
commercial
speech.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
if
that
interpretation
of
our
overbreadth
doctrine
is
correct,
you
just
don't
have
any
claim
for
all
these
other
cases
you're
worried
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
what
had
happened
the
previous
times?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
she
may
have
a
tort
action
for
that
here.
are
you
complaining
about
the
excessive
use
of
force?
about
the
handcuffs
and
all
that?
that
does
seem
excessive
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
issue
is
whether
she
should
have
left
when
she
was
asked
to
leave.
isn't
that
the
only
issue
before
us?
not
the
handcuffs,
or
all
of
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
should
she
have
left,
when
she
was
asked
to
leave,
because
there
was
a
valid
regulation?
that's
the
only
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
--at
least
we
found
a
question
you
don't
want
us
to
reach,
huh?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
talking
big
money.
we're
not
just
talking
a
pot
or
a
pan.
what
were
the
amounts
that
they
were
getting
students
committed
to...
$6,000,
i
forget
the
number?
justice
antonin
scalia
commercial
enterprise...
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
xxx.
justice
white,
he'll
vote
against
you
if--
--[inaudible].
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
reath,
that
may
be
fine
for
some
universities...
maybe
most
of
them
prefer
that.
but,
maybe
suny
wants
to
have
a
stricter
rule,
just
as
some
parents
might
want
to
send
their
children
to
universities
that
have
no
parietal
restrictions,
whatever...
that
allow
visitors
in
dorms
of
male
or
female,
at
any
hours.
other
colleges
don't.
now,
you
made
a
statement,
earlier,
that
the
students
were
upset
that
this
deprives
of
their
right
to
have
a
visitor
in
their
room.
whatever
visitor
they
want.
are...
doesn't
the
college
have
any...
have
any
power
to
establish
in
dormitories,
in
which
it's
acting,
in
loco
parentis,
for
minor
students,
for
many
of
these
colleges,
certain
reasonable
rules?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
may
that
not
vary
from
one
college
to
another?
