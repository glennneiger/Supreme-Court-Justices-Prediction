justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
the
lawyer?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
commercial
speech...
this
is
commercial
speech.
the
doctrine
of
overbreadth
doesn't
apply
at
all,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
one
of
them
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
case
or
controversy...
the
issue
here
is
product
demonstrations?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
application
we're
talking
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
you
lose
in
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
happens
if
you
win
here?
if
your
case
is
over
in
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
no,
but,
what
happens
to
the
judgment
against
you
in
the
district
court?
it
never
was
appealed.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
lost?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
you
lost
on
the
ground
that
it
had
become
final
a
long
time
ago,
and
it's
too
late
to
redo
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
might
have
kept
your...
you
might
have
appealed
this
adverse
judgment
and
kept
your
case
alive.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
hasn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it...
the
district
court
hasn't
done
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there's
an
injunction
outstanding,
isn't
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
you
make
sure
there's
enough
time
that
students
have
to
study?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
are
just
aiming
at
commercial
speech--
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
are
just
aiming
at
commercial
speech?
that's
content
oriented,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
who
brought
this
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
who
wanted
to
do
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
is
that
the
issue?
that's
the
application
of
this
regulation
that
we're
talking
about
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
was
there...
were
there
some
intervening
plaintiffs?
justice
byron
r.
white
who?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
what
did
they...
and
these
other
people
had
other
interests,
besides
having
tupperware
parties?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
has
this
got
to
do
with
the
issue
before
us?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
has
this
got
to
do
with
the
issue
before
us?
we're
trying
to
find
out
if
this
regulation
may
validly
be
applied
to
preventing
a
tupperware
party?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
sounds
to
me
like
you're
disagreeing
with
the
court
of
appeals.
i
thought
the
court
of
appeals
said
this
was
a
commercial
speech
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you're
saying,
you're
trying
to
say
that
it
isn't
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yeah,
but
that
isn't--
justice
byron
r.
white
--the
court
of
appeals
that
said
it
was
only
a
commercial
speech
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
you're
going
to...
if
you
want
to,
if
you
want
to
have
the
case
decided
on
a
ground
that
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
use,
and
if
that's
going
to...
you
can't
do
that
if
it's
going
to
expand
your
relief,
and
i
would
think
saying
this
isn't
a
commercial
speech
case
but
some
other
kind
of
a
speech
case
would
give
you
a
lot
more
than
you
won
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
--mr.
reath,
i
thought
one
of
the
issues...
the
major
issue
in
this
case
was
whether
or
not
the
least
restrictive
means
test--
justice
byron
r.
white
--is
a
proper
and
i
can't...
i've
hardly
heard
a
word
about
it
from
either
side.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
interest
that
you
concede?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
interest...
that
you
concede?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
so,
you
accept
that
as
a
substantial
interest?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
and,
now
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
now,
prong
3--
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
don't
contest
that
one,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
here?
you
mean
this
regulation
doesn't
further
that
substantial
interest?
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
they
could
even
keep
out
tupperware.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
finally,
we're
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
isn't
what...
that
isn't
what
central
hudson
said.
it
didn't
say
the
"least
restrictive".
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
talk
about
central
hudson.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
central
hudson
says
"narrowly
tailored".
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
the
same
thing.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
what
central
hudson
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
it
said
"narrowly
tailored"?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
think
that
"narrowly
tailored"
means
the
same
thing
as
"least
restrictive",
do
you?
