justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
gave
us
the
first
reason.
i'd
like
to
go
back.
you
gave
us
your
first
reason
for
this
regulation
that
it
reduces
the
problem
of
one
student
contacting
another
student
for
a
commercial
transaction--
could
you
prohibit
that
directly?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
say
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
one
student
to
contact
another
student
with
reference
to
a
commercial
transaction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
asking
you
whether
you
could
prohibit
that
directly.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
one
student
from
contacting
a
second
student
about
a
commercial
transaction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
if
you
can't
do
it
directly
how
can
you
argue
that
it's
legitimate
for
this
ordinance
to
do
it
indirectly?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
began
by
defending
the
rule
as
saying
that
it
prevents
or
diminishes
the
instances
in
which
one
student
contacts
another
student
for
a
commercial
transaction.
and
then,
i
asked
you,
could
you
do
that
directly,
and
you
indicated
that
you
can't
do
that
directly.
well,
if
you
can't
do
it
directly,
then
how
can
you
justify
this
ordinance
for
that
objective?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
then
you're
not
concerned
with
one
student
soliciting
another?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
clear
that
a
time,
place
and
manner
regulation
is...
can
be
sustained
if
it's
not
content
neutral.
i
may
be
incorrect.
do
we
have
any
cases
where
we
sustained
a
regulation
on
a
time,
base...
time,
place
and
manner
in
a
regulation
and
it's
not
content
neutral?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but,
this
isn't
content
neutral.
