well,
we
may
have
an
overbreadth
problem.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we
may
have
an
overbreadth
problem,
of
course,
and
it
depends
on
the
meaning
of
the
regulation,
and
how
are
we
to
know
what
it
means?
the
testimony
below,
certainly
gave
it
a
very
broad
interpretation.
and,
the
district
court
appeared
to
give
it
a
rather
broad
interpretation.
what
are
we
to
make
of
that
regulation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
can
certainly
be
offered
in
defense
of
the
judgment
below,
can't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
didn't
understand
that.
do
you
want
to
cite
something
to
us?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
you
looked
at
what
it
did.
you
have
to
look
at
what
it
says
to
determine
if
it's
content
neutral.
what
does
it
prohibit,
and
what
does
it
not?
how
else
could
you
interpret
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
wasn't
the
afs
a
party?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
wasn't
the
company
a
party
at
one
time?
afs?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and,
you
represented
the
company
originally?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
they
dropped
out?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
i
just
inquire,
first
of
all
though,
whether
the
student
host
was
going
to
earn
something
by
virtue
of
hosting
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no
credits,
or
no
florida
trip
or
something?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and,
some
kind
of
$50
discount?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no?
the
record
doesn't
support
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and,
the
student
host
earns
nothing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
nothing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
something,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
that
was
something.
now,
do
you
think,
do
you
think
the
university
can
prohibit
students
from
conducting
commercial
enterprises
in
their
rooms?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
isn't
that
a
commercial
enterprise?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
student's
earning
something
for
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
reath,
why
isn't
the
regulation
somewhat
akin
to
a
zoning
regulation
that's
typical
in
a
lot
of
communities
that
says
you
can't
conduct
a
commercial
enterprise
in
your
home?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
why
isn't
that
similar?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
conceivably,
it
might.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
conceivably,
it
might.
how
many
times
does
it
take
to
make
it
a
commercial
