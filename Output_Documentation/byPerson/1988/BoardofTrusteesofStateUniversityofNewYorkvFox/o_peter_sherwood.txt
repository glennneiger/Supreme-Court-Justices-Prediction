mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
to
paraphrase
the
district
court,
the
gravamen
of
a
complaint
in
this
case,
is
that
the
state
university
of
new
york,
we
call
it
suny,
has
refused
to
permit
american
future
systems,
a
company
that
markets
pots,
pans,
cutlery,
and
dishes,
to
conduct
product
demonstrations
in
campus
dormitory
rooms.
the
respondents
have
a
radically
different
view
of
the
case.
they
argue
that
this
case
concerns
the
pure
speech
rights
of
students.
but
the
second
circuit,
like
the
district
court,
concluded
that
the
only
speech
involved
in
this
case,
is
constitutionally
subordinate
commercial
speech.
however,
in
evaluating
the
commercial
speech
involved
here,
the
second
circuit
made
a
critically
important
error.
today,
i
want
to
spend
a
minute,
laying
out
our
position,
and
then,
i
plan
to
discuss
why
the
second
circuit
decision
must
be
reversed.
we
maintain
that
the
challenge
regulations,
designated
suny
resolution
66-156,
does
nothing
more
than
prohibit
the
operation
of...
for-profit
commercial
enterprise
on
suny
campuses
and
that
it
is
constitutional.
we
believe,
that
if
the
second
circuit
had
simply,
properly
applied
the
standards
of
review
for
restrictions
on
commercial
speech,
it
would
have
sustained
the
regulations.
and,
even
if
it
was
disinclined
to
sustain
the
regulation,
on
that
basis,
it
should
have
sustained
it
as
a
permissible
time,
place,
and
manner
restriction.
we,
of
course,
adhere
to
the
other
reasons
set
forth
in
our
brief,
for
sustaining
the
regulations.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
if
an
attorney
wished
to
visit,
where
he's
not
yet
been
retained--
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
--there
is
testimony
in
the
record
from,
i
believe
norman
hofstaeder,
in
which
he
says
no,
that
that
would
not
be
permitted,
believing
that
there
would
be
more
appropriate
places
for
those
kinds
of
communications.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
i
think
under
those...
there's
no
testimony
in
the
record,
with
respect
to
that
example.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
the
regulation
doesn't
speak
to
it
directly.
the
regulations...
the
terms
of
the
regulations
simply
are
that,
for-profit
commercial...
no
authorization
shall
be
given
for
the
operation
of
for
profit
commercial
enterprises.
it
would
seem
to
me,
that
given
the
example
that
you
just
gave
me,
justice
blackmun,
that
that
would
not
be
conducting...
that
would
not
be
operating
a
business
on
the
campus.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
i'm
simply
referring
to
the
testimony
that
was
given.
i
would
say
that
that
testimony
is
rather
ambiguous.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
what
about...
that
question
was
asked,
too.
a
tutor,
according
to
the
testimony,
as
i
recalled
it...
dr.
pogue,
i
believe,
suggested
that
in
his
interpretation,
or
maybe
it
was
murabito,
that
that
would
not
be
permitted.
i
should
say
though,
that
with
respect
to
these
examples,
the
case
here
involved
and
focused
on,
simply,
efforts
by
american
future
systems
to
put
on
product
demonstrations
in
dormitory
rooms.
none
of
the
students,
in
their
complaint,
or
otherwise,
indicated
that
they,
in
fact,
wanted
to
put
on...
wanted
to
have
doctors
in
their
rooms,
or
to--
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
--excuse
me?
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
well,
i
believe
overbroad...
overbreadth
is
not
here,
justice
o'connor.
and
there
are
at
least
four
reasons
why
overbreadth
is
not
here.
first
of
all,
it
wasn't
raised
below
in
any...
in
any
sense.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
i
believe
that
you
have
to
have
preserved
that
claim,
beyond
that.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
the
cases
that
we've
cited
in
our
applied
brief,
i,
i
admit,
are
circuit
court
cases.
we
have
not
cited
any
supreme
court
cases
that
address
that
beyond
that.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
i
agree.
as
i
said,
there
are
at
least
four
reasons
why
overbreadth
wouldn't
apply
here.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
the
first
had
to
do
with
non-preservation.
the
second
has
to
do
with
the
fact
that
it
doesn't
apply...
overbreadth
doesn't
apply
to
commercial
speech.
the
third
has
to
do
with
the
fact
that
this...
the
challenge
regulation
here
involves
conduct,
not
simply
speech.
and,
in
oklahoma
and
broderick,
that
was
a...
where
you
got
that
kind
of
circumstance,
overbreadth
does
not
apply.
and
beyond
that,
the
regulation
here
could
be
invalidated
as
overbreadth
only
on
a...
upon
a
showing
that
it
was
substantially
overbroad.
and
then,
this
court
said,
just
last
term,
in
the
new
york
state
club
association's
case,
you
would
have
to
have
a
showing
from
the
text
of
the
regulations
an
actual
fact
of
a
substantial
number
of
instances
existing,
in
which
the
regulation
cannot
be
applied
constitutionally.
i
don't
think
that
we
have
that
here.
otherwise,
what
this
court
would
do,
and
what
courts
are
obliged
to
do,
is
to
solve
those
potential,
extended
applications
of
a
regulation
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
the
students
in
this
case...
that
challenged
this
regulation,
never
once,
asserted
any
other
interest
here,
other
than
the
fact
that
they
wanted
to
host,
or
listen
to,
demonstrations
by
american
future
systems.
and
so,
we
believe
that
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
the
overbreadth
doctrine
would
apply.
the
focus
of
this
case
has
been
on
afs'
demonstration.
the
case
that
was
tried
in
the
district
court
focused
on
that.
yes,
there
were
a
number
of
hypothetical
questions
made
of
witnesses
for
the
university,
in
which
they
were
asked,
"what
about
doctors",
"what
about
tutors"?
in
one
instance,
there
was
a
question
asked,
"what
about
the
sale
of
a
bicycle,
from
one
student
to
another
student?
"
and,
you
got
conflicting
testimony
there.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
absolutely.
and,
that's
all
that's
before
this
court,
quite
frankly.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
no.
it
was
not.
you're
talking
about
the
october
8th,
1988
decision?
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
that...
no.
we
did
not
take
an
appeal
there.
we
moved
in
the
district
court
for
a
stay,
because
this
court
had,
on
the
very
day
that
the
district
court
decided
the
case
and
granted
cert,
and
to
my
knowledge,
the
district
court
hasn't
acted
on
that
motion
yet.
so,
that's
the
posture
that
we're
in
here.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
after
the
second
circuit
decided
the
case,
the
district
court
then
applied
the
commercial
speech
standard,
as
it
was
defined
by
the
second
circuit,
the
second
circuit
having
said
that,
with
respect
to
the
fourth
prong
of
the
central
hudson
test,
that
that
involved
a,
a
least
restrictive
means
test.
the
district
court
said
given
our
justifications
for
having
this
regulation
that
we
could
not
meet
that
standard,
and
therefore,
struck
down
the
regulation.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
i
believe
you
could.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
well,
the
only
thing
that
exists
beyond,
in
the
district
court,
at
this
point,
beyond
what
the
second
circuit
concerned
was
the
decision.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
there
was
not
a
hearing.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
no.
the
district
court
here
simply
decided
that
it
would...
undertook
to...
it
got
back
the
mandate,
and
undertook
to
enter
a
decision
resolving
the
case.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
none
of
those.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
got
the
remand
and
made
a
decision.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
if
we
win
here,
we
believe
that
the
case
is
over.
we
believe
that
we're
entitled
to,
or
should
receive,
a
reversal.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
i
would
imagine
that
we
would
go
back
to
the
district
court
in
that
circumstance,
and
seek
to
have
the
judgment
vacated,
in
view
of
the
decision
in
this
court.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
we
would
then
seek
to
appeal
from
the
denial
of
our--
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
--well,
the
district
court
does
have
before
it,
a
motion
in
our
part
4
stay,
and
we
assume
that
you
would--
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
--i
assume
that
it
is
in
effect,
given
that
the
court
has
yet
to
act
on
our
application
for
the
stay.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
i
doubt
it.
[laughter]
well,
it
could
overrule
you,
instead
by
a
vote--
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
--excuse
me?
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
it
is
certainly
the
same
case.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
we
thought
that
we
certainly
might
have
done
that,
but
we
thought
the
appropriate
way
to
approach
the
matter
was
to
request
to
the
district
board,
a
stay,
pending
a
determination
by
this
court.
after
all,
the
court
had...
this
court
had
granted
cert,
and
we're
here
now
arguing
the
case
upon
that
grant
of
cert.
so,
we
thought
that
it
was
appropriate,
simply
at
the
district
court
to
hold
everything
in
abeyance.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
rather
than...
pardon?
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
he
doesn't
anything
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
there
is
an
injunction
outstanding,
yes.
but
our
motion
has
not
been
acted
on.
we
do
have...
and
that
motion
is...
we
do
have
motions
also
pending
pursuant
to
rule
59,
i've
been
reminded,
and
i
believe
that
we
don't
have
a
need
to
take
an
appeal
while
our
motion
is
pending.
as
applied
to
the
underlying
controversy
in
this
case,
resolution
no.
66-156
of
the
trustee,
does
prohibit
the
holding
of
tupperware
parties
in
students'
dormitory
rooms,
and
it
is
not,
in
any
sense,
a
reflection
of
any
animus
on
the
part
of
the
university
against
american
future
systems,
or
mary
kay,
or
the
fuller
brush
company,
or
any
of
the
other
hundreds,
or
even
thousands
of
direct
marketing
companies
that
operate
in
the
united
states.
rather,
the
regulation
is
intended
to
preserve
the
educational
character
of
suny
campuses,
and
to
respond
to
the
safety
and
security
concerns
on
campus.
the
second
circuit
recognized
that
these
were
substantial
interests.
now,
even
though
the
second
circuit
correctly
saw
this
case
as
involving
commercial
speech,
and
not
pure
speech,
it
held
that
the
regulation
would
not
be
sustained,
as
i
said
before,
because...
largely
because
the
standard
that
it
viewed
to
be
appropriate
is
the
least
restrictive
means
test.
it
also
sent
back
the
case,
by
the
way,
for
the
district
court
to
make
determinations
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
the
regulation
directly
advanced
the
state's
interests.
the
respondents
here,
interestingly,
do
not
seek
to
make
virtually
no
effort
to
defend
that
holding...
that
untenable
holding
of
the
district...
of
the
second
circuit.
they
assert,
instead,
that
suny
hasn't
proved
that
the
regulation
isn't
more
extensive
than
necessary.
for
this
reason,
i
want
to
focus
largely
on
the
fourth
aspect
of
the
central
hudson
test.
as
i've
already
mentioned,
the
regulation
is
intended
to
promote
the
educational
character
of
the
university's
facilities,
and
to
preserve
the
safety
and
security
on
campus.
to
an
extent,
the
regulation
is
a
prophylactic
measure,
which
is
designed
to
forestall
a
perceived
harm.
and
these
predictive
judgments,
we
contend,
made
by
university
officials
who
have
both
the
authority
and
responsibility
for
maintaining
the
campuses
is
entitled
to
some
deference
unless
there
is
a
showing
that
their
actions
here
are
unreasonable.
the
only
way
that
the
university
is
going
to
preserve,
we
submit,
the
educational
character
of
its
campuses
and
avoid
turning
campuses
into
commercial
bazaars
is
to
prohibit
the
operation
of
commercial
enterprises
on
campus.
afs
is
just
one
of
the
many
companies
that
seeks
to
market
directly
to
college
students.
its
demonstrations
last
two
to
three
hours.
each
one
of
them
lasts
two
to
three
hours.
the
federal
court
in
philadelphia
found
that
at
penn
state,
afs
managed
to
put
on
51
product
demonstrations
in
just
a
two-week
period.
one
can
see,
pretty
readily,
that
the
prospect
of
students
seeking
to
earn
incentives...
putting
the
arm
on
their
fellow
students
to...
to
attend
presentations
and
purchase
products,
has
a
potential
for
creating
tensions
among
students
and
can
alter
the
character
of
the
university.
in
addition,
the
regulation
is
a
way
of
dealing
with
security
risks
on
campus.
a
prohibition
on
the
operation
of
commercial
enterprises
has
the
effect
of
limiting
the
number
of
strangers
who
come
on
to
the
campus.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
security
concerns?
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
well,
this
regulation
now
is...
where
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is...
it
is
an
appropriate...
i
guess
it
goes
to
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
that's
a
substantial
governmental
interest.
it
seems
to
me
there
is.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
we're
not
attempting,
justice
scalia,
to
turn
a
campus
into
a
high-security
facility,
by
any
means.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
because...
well,
in
our
experience,
at
one
of
our
campuses,
there
was
a
time,
when,
under
a
permit
system,
people
were
permitted
to
operate
businesses
in
the
campus
quad.
the
number
of
people
coming
on
to
campus,
and
actually
functioning
on
campus
increased
dramatically,
because
of
the
ability
of
students
to...
of
those
individuals
who
are
not
students,
to
run
businesses
on
campus.
when
you
have
many,
many
more
people
on
campus,
it
is
more
difficult
for
the
university
to
monitor
the
campuses...
to
monitor
the
campuses.
and
that's
particularly
true
where
you're
talking
about
dormitories,
where
you
have
perfect
strangers
sort
of
coming
and
going
in
and
out
of
the
dormitories
all
the
time.
it
is
very
difficult
for
the
university
to
provide
security
for
on
campus.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
that's...
certainly
their
location
makes
a
difference,
justice
marshall.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
well,
if,
if,
if
you
view
the
quad
at
nyu
to
be
washington
square
park,
i
suppose
that's
correct.
but,
we're
talking
here
about...
this
is
a
university-wide
regulation,
and
we're
talking
about,
for
the
most
part,
campuses
that
are
in,
in
locations
where
there
are...
where
there
is
a
discrete
area
set
aside
as
a
campus.
while
we
don't
want
to
prevent
students
from
having
people
come
on
to
campus--
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
--nyu--
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
--well,
it's
sort
of
around
washington
square.
washington
square
park
is
a
big
park.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
that's
true.
but,
even
there--
--that's
your
law
school,
isn't
it?
excuse
me?
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
actually,
nyu
is,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
but
even
if...
at
a
place
like
columbia,
having
people
operate
businesses
there
increases
pretty
dramatically
the
number
of
people
who
are
strangers,
unknown
to
the
university
or
university
officials,
coming
on
to
campus.
xxx.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
could
we
prohibit
directly--
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
with
respect
to--
in
other
words
to
simply
talk
to
another
student
about
having
a
commercial
transaction.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
i
don't
think
that's
covered
by
this
regulation,
it
says
that
you
can't
operate
a
business--
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
could
we
prohibit
directly--
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
i
believe
we
could
not
and
do
not
wish
to.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
because
the
justification...
because
the
justification
for
this
regulation
really
isn't
aimed
at
the
speech
itself.
i
took
your
question
to
be
can
you
prohibit
speech
where
your
purpose
is
to,
is
to
prevent
the
speech
in
order,
because
of
the
content
or
some
related
purpose...
something
related
to
the
context
of
the
speech?
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
because
if
you
have,
as
i
understand,
this...
i
took
your
question
to
be
the
linmark
situation,
in
which,
could
one,
for
example,
prohibit
"for
sale"
signs
on
the
lawn?
and,
i
believe,
you
can't
do
that.
you
certainly
cannot
do
that
directly,
where
the
purpose
is
to
affect
what
is
contained
on
the
sign
here.
what
we
are
seeking
to
do
in
this
circumstance
is...
our
purposes,
our
justification
for
this
program,
for
this
regulation,
has
to
do
with
the
secondary
effects
that
it
associated
with
that
kind
of
conduct.
we're
not
aimed
at...
we're
not
aiming
this
regulation
at
the
speech
itself.
we
are
really
quite
unconcerned
with
whether
a
student
wants
to
sell
something
to
another
student
or
not.
what
we
are
concerned
with
is
speech,
plus
in
person,
and
in
person
present
on
the
campus,
operating
a
business.
that's
what
we--
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
--we're
not
concerned
with
a
direct
solicitation
between
one
student
or
another.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
well,
we
would
certainly
that...
that's
so
as
well,
and
that
is
a
concern
of
ours,
and
there
is
some
testimony
in
the
record
with
respect
to
that.
however,
where
we
are
not,
in
any
sense,
seeking
to
regiment
the
students...
how
the
students
conduct
their
out-of-class
time.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
that's
true.
they
could
go
to
the
movie
if
they
want,
or
they
could
watch
television,
or
they
could
do
many
other
things.
but,
again,
the
purpose
of
this
regulation
really
isn't
aimed
at
suppressing
speech,
as
such.
we're
aiming
at
some
of
its
secondary
effects,
which
have
to
do
with
security
concerns
that
we
have,
and
also
the
concern
for
preserving
the
educational
character
of
the...
of
the
campus.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
we
would
like
to
retain--
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
--that's
correct.
which
goes
to
our,
i
suppose,
to
the
second
issue
that
i
wanted
to
discuss
this
afternoon,
and
that
is,
the
justification
of
this
regulation
as
a
time,
place
and
manner
restriction.
because
here,
i
think
it's
important
to
remember
that
we're
not
seeking
to
ban
commercial
activity.
students
and
afs
can
contact
students
in
their
dorm
rooms...
by
telephone
if
they
wish.
they
can
use
campus
newspapers;
they
can
use
radio;
they
can
use
mass
media.
but
if
they
insist
on
"in-person"
sales
and
presentations,
that
is
banned,
and
if
they
want
to
have
that
kind
of
marketing,
then
they
can
do
that
at
locations
right
off
the
campus.
it
is
the...
it's
the
combination
of
both
speech
with
the
physical
presence
that
is
our
concern.
speech
alone
is
not
the
concern
that
we
have.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
i
believe
one
of
the
requirements
that
this
court
has
imposed,
with
respect
to
time,
place
and
manner
restrictions,
is
precisely
that.
that
it
be
content
neutral,
and
i
would
submit--
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
--oh,
it
certainly
is
content
neutral,
because
defining
what...
whether
a
particular
regulation
is
content
neutral
or
not
really
goes
to
the
justification
that's
given
for
the
regulation.
our
justification
here
is
not
aimed
at
the
speech
itself,
but
rather
at
secondary
effects
that
may
be
associated
with
that
speech,
and
so
we
are
not
here...
we
don't
have
the
linmark
situation,
as
i
mentioned
before.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
excuse
me?
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
well,
the
fact--
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
--well,
again,
as
i
understand
this
court's
decisions,
having
to
do
with
content
neutrality,
you
really
look
to
whether
or
not
the
justification
given
for
the
restriction
is
aimed
at
the
speech
itself
or
whether
it's
aimed
at
some
other
concern,
having
nothing
to
do
with
speech.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
well,
one
can,
for
example,
prohibit,
prohibit
camping,
i
suppose,
in
lafayette
park,
where,
and
what
was
prohibited
there
is
people
seeking
to
make...
to
symbolically
protest
the
plight
of
the
homeless.
there
is
some
reference
to
the
content
of
that
kind
of
conduct.
but,
certainly,
the
court,
this
court
did
not
thereby
say
that
one
could
not...
that
that
kind
of
regulation
is
one
that's
not
content
neutral,
as
i
understand
the
court's
cases.
i
would
like
to--
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
--could
a
encyclopedia
britannica
salesman
come
on
campus
and
sell?
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
i
believe
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
and
there,
you're,
you
are
talking
about
the
conduct
of--
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
--one
can
argue
that
he
is
advancing
education.
that's
true.
but
what
he
is
doing,
in
that
circumstance,
is
selling
his
wares
on
campus,
and
this
rule
applies
to
solicitations.
i
should
say,
with
respect
to
that,
again,
that
none
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
have
standing
to
raise
that
kind
of
claim,
because
it
is
not
addressed
to.
the
only
thing...
the
only
harm
that
these
students
have
complained
about,
is
the
refusal
of
the
university
to
permit
them
to
either
host
or
to
listen
to
afs
presentations.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
o.
peter
sherwood
i
just
wanted
to
say
one
thing.
this
regulation
has
been
around
for
over
20
years,
and
there's
no
evidence
anywhere
in
this
record,
that
that
regulation
has
ever
been
used,
or
applied
to
pure
speech
on
any
suny
campus.
thank
you.
