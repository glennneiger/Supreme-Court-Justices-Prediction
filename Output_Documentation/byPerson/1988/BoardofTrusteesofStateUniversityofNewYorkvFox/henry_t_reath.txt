mr.
henry
t.
reath
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court:
i
don't...
i
have
the
benefit,
i
guess,
because
i
was
trial
counsel
and
i've
been
with
this
case
ever
since
it
started...
that,
in
that
sense,
i
know
a
good
bit
more
about
the
case
than
mr.
sherwood.
unfortunately,
mr.
sherwood
has
made
several
statements
to
this
court,
as
to
the
underlying
facts,
that
just
are
not
correct.
and,
i
will
correct
them
in
due
order.
the
one
that
i
want
to
address
immediately,
however,
is
his
contention,
that
the
students
in
this
case...
none
of
the
students,
at
any
time,
he
said,
raised
the
other
issues
such
as
the
questions
asked
by
justice
blackmun
and
others,
about
the
right
to
have
an
attorney,
the
right
to
have
a
tutor,
and
such
things
as
that.
your
honors,
at
page
10
in
my
brief,
i
quote
from
the
testimony
of
edward
k.
detweller,
a
student
government
representative
at
suny-cortland.
10...
"i
became
interested
in
this
case,
because
of
the
infringement
upon
my
rights,
my
constitutional
rights
of
assembly
and
speech.
"
"it
bothered
me
to
know
i
couldn't
invite
somebody
such
as
an
attorney
or
some
commercial
person
to
my
dorm.
"
and,
then
the
same
thing
was
said
[inaudible]--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--no,
sir,
there
was
not,
but
again
your
honor--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--your
honor,
understanding
issues,
justice
stevens,
there
are
a
bulk
of
cases
this
court
has
said
you
do
not
have
to
run
the
risk
of
being
arrested
or
being
held
in
contempt,
or
your
rights
at
the
university
being
in
jeopardy.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
henry
t.
reath
i
can't...
i
can't
answer
that.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
well,
your
honor,
there
is
an
issue.
because
what
we
have,
and
i'll
come
to
that
in
just
a
moment.
what
we
have
here,
is
the
way
in
which
the
university
took
a
regulation,
which
on
its
face
said
you
can't
have
commercial
enterprises
on
campus,
and
then
totally
distorted
and
turned
it
around
against
the
students,
because
if
there's
one
thing
that
must
be
made
clear,
and
i
think
it
makes
this
case
so
different
in
terms
of
the
legal
impact
of
this
case
in
court's
earlier
case,
and
otherwise,
is
this
case,
your
honors,
is
a
right
to
listen
case.
it
involves
the
students'
rights
to
listen
and
to
invite
whoever
they
want
to
come
into
their
room.
whether
it's
a
lawyer,
whether
it's
a
tupperware
party,
whether
it's
christmas
cards--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
well,
i
think
you
could
say
it
does.
because
i
think
that
when
we
have
argued...
we
have
argued
that
in
our
brief,
sir,
that--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--no.
i
say
that
the
court
doesn't
have
to
come
to
that.
because,
either
under
the
commercial
speech
standard,
or
under
core
speech
standard,
and
following
the
four
part
test
of
commercial
hudson,
which
is
what
the
second
circuit
did;
which
is
what
the
lower
court
did.
we
prevail
entirely
under
commercial
hudson.
but,
to
answer
your
question,
specifically,
your
honor,
we
suggest
in
the
brief
an
alternate
argument,
which
is...
that
if
you
are
looking
at
the
right
to
listen,
and
that
is
the
right
that
is
involved,
as
the
counterpoint
to
the
right
to
speak,
then
the
motivation
of
the
listener
makes
no
difference,
because--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
excuse
me.
excuse
me,
sir,
i
apologize.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
and,
your
honor,
what
we're
saying
is,
that
the
right
to
listen,
as
a
right,
is
a
one
on
one.
if
i,
as
a
student,
want
to
have
somebody
come
to
my
room
to
tell
me
about
law,
about
medicine,
or
whatever
subject
i
want,
i,
as
a
student,
have
that
right,
which
is
the
counterpart
of
the
right
to
free
speech.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
well,
because
that,
your
honor,
immediately
conflicts
with
the
right
of
everybody
else
on
the
street.
and,
you
can't
argue...
i
mean,
i
agree
with
your
honor,
that
if
you
carried
that
right
to
listen
that
far.
but,
what
we're
saying
is,
the
right
to
listen
is
in
a
one-on-one
setting.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
your
honor,
this
suit
was
brought,
initially
by
one
student,
kathleen
rapp,
who
was
the
person
who
was
involved
in
the
proceeding.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
he
wanted
the
right
to
invite
and
have
a
tupperware
party
in
his
room.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
yes,
sir.
now,
what
happened,
your
honor,
is
that
after
we
had
extensive
discovery,
and
it
came
out,
and
in
answer
to
one
of
the
questions
about...
mr.
sherwood
said
that
there's
nothing
that
prohibits
people
from
selling
books
and
bicycles.
absolutely
wrong.
the
senior
person
for
suny--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
a
whole
number
of
intervening
plaintiffs.
the
president
of
the
student
council,
steven
gawley.
another
member
of
the
student
council.
several
people
who
are
very
active
in
campus
life,
and
they
all
intervened,
and
suny
objected
to
their
intervention.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
absolutely.
and,
that's
the
whole
point.
and,
your
honor,
that's
all
spelled
out
in
our
brief
at
pages
9
through
11.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
excuse
me,
justice
o'connor?
mr.
henry
t.
reath
they
were,
originally,
your
honor.
and
then,
what
happened--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--i
did
represent
the
company.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
and
they've
dropped
out.
that's
correct.
and
then,
what
happened
was,
that
when
the
students
saw
the
breadth
and
the
scope
of
the
application
of
this
regulation
and
saw
how
it
applied
to
an
attorney
coming
into
the
room,
to
a
medical
doctor,
to
a
tutor--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--yes.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
yes.
mr.
fox
was
turned
down.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
he
was
the
original
plaintiff.
the
others?
mr.
henry
t.
reath
no,
sir.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
that
is
correct.
but,
on
the
other
hand,
your
honor...
may
i
just
briefly
refer
to
the
court
how
this
incident
started,
because,
i
think,
that
when
your
honor
sees
how
the
incident
started,
you
will
understand
why
the
students
would
be
very
reluctant
to
test
and
challenge
the
university
in
the
way
it
interpreted
its
regulation.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
no,
your
honor.
the
student
host--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--there
was
an
offer,
your
honor,
of
a
free
florida
vacation.
that
was
involved
in
the
case...
the
testimony
also
shows
that
that--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--no,
sir.
no,
your
honor.
excuse
me.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
there
were
no
discounts,
no
credits.
the
only...
only
for
someone
who
had
already
been
a
purchaser.
if
someone
had
already
been
a
purchaser,
and
then
they
hosted
a
party,
they
would
get
a
credit.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
nothing,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
except
the
free
florida
vacation.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
well,
well--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--i
think
they
can,
but
that's
not
what
is
involved
here.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
this
is
not
a
commercial
enterprise,
because
the
student
is
a
host...
the
student
is
a
bonafide
host--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--well,
your
honor,
you
can
say
that.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
but,
that
is
only
one
of
many
instances
that
is
involved
in
the
issues
before
this
court.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
well,
your
honor,
what
happened--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--yes,
your
honor,
but
if
i
can
explain
that
what
happened
here
was,
that
after
the
case
got
started,
we
tried
to
find
out
what
was
the
regulation,
how
it
was
interpreted,
how
it
was
applied,
and
who
it
would
apply
to.
and,
the
senior
person
for
suny,
who
was
presented
by
suny
to
explain
and
justify
and
show
what
the
amendment
was
and
how
it
worked,
was
a
mr.
hofstaeder.
and,
he
was
questioned.
and,
i
asked
him
these
questions:
"have
you
ever
issued
any
clarifying
bulletins,
explaining
the
interpretations
of
the
words
in
this
regulation?
"
"no,
i
have
not".
"well,
what
would
be
your
definition
of
a
private
commercial
enterprise?
"
answer.
"it
would
be
an
organization
that
deals
in
a
product,
which
the
end
result
would
be
the
making
of
a
profit
for
that
group.
"
mr.
henry
t.
reath
this
is
the
pretrial
testimony,
justice
scalia,
of
the
senior
representative
of
suny,
who
was
produced
by
suny
as
that
person
who
was
authorized
to
speak
for
and
explain
the
application,
and
how
that
regulation
was
filed.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
henry
t.
reath
his
title
was
assistant
vice
chancellor
for
educational
services,
and
also...
he
also
had
charge
of
security.
and
he
was
tendered
under
rule
30(b)
as
the
officer
who
was
authorized
to
speak
for
suny
as
to
how
this
regulation
applied.
now,
here's
what
went
on:
"what
about
a
service...
would
a
service
be
included
within
that
definition.
"
answer:
"if
it
is
a
service,
outside
services
we
already
provide
for,
yes.
"
question:
"supposing
there
was
person
who
had
a
private
job
counseling
service,
who,
for
a
fee,
would
counsel
students
regarding
appropriate
jobs
and
job
opportunities
on
graduation,
would
they
be
permitted
to
come
on
campus,
at
the
invitation
of
the
student
to
meet
with
one
or
more
students
in
the
privacy
of
the
student's
room
to
learn
about
that
service?
"
"no,
they
would
not".
"why
is
that"?
the
answer:
"this
is
already
provided".
similarly,
i
asked
this
question:
"if
there
was
a
student,
who
had
been
given
a
small
inheritance
by
an
aunt
or
some
family
representative,
and
that
student
wanted
to
consult
with
a
lawyer,
as
to
his
or
her
legal
rights,
and
wanted
to
use
his
or
her
dorm
room
as
the
place
for
the
meeting....
"
mr.
henry
t.
reath
excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
henry
t.
reath
because,
your
honor,
the
way
the
interpret...
the
way
the
regulation
is
applied
and
interpreted,
and
they
went
on
to
say
that
it
includes
any
person
who
seeks
to
provide
information
for
a
profit.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
the
court
of
appeals
did,
your
honor,
and
we--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--no,
i'm
saying
it
is
more
than
a
commercial
speech
case.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
it
is
a--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--well,
we
will
accept
that,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
well,
your
honors,
i
believe
that
this
court
has
the
power
to
look
at
and
take
a
practical
view
of
what
is
the
regulation,
and
how
the
regulation
works.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
well,
your
honors,
as
i've
said
before--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--that
is
right.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
well,
your
honor,
there
are
others
who
have
joined
in
the
suit,
who
say
that
we
want
to
exercise
these
rights.
and,
what
i
was
trying
to
say
to
the
court
was,
that
what
happened
to
the
young
lady
who
had
appeared
on
this
initial
demonstration,
and
i
was
about
to
read
that,
and
if
i
may
take
just
a
second
to
read
what
happened.
because,
what
happened
to
her
that
day
and
the
very
next
day,
shows
a
hostile
attitude
by
the
university
that
is
incredible,
i
think,
when
you
think
of
what
the
rights
of
students
are
to
use
their
own
dorm
rooms,
within
the
privacy
of
their
rooms,
for
whatever
purposes
they
wish,
as
long
it
is
lawful,
peaceful
conduct.
and
here's
what
happened.
she
described
how
she'd
come
in.
she'd
been
invited
by
the
girls
to
come
to
present
the
party.
she
called
up
the
night
before,
said,
"do
you
still
want
the
party?
"
"yes",
and
she
came.
and
then,
a
dorm
representative
came,
and
said,
"you're
not
allowed
to
do
this;
you
have
to
leave.
"
and
she
said,
"well,
i
think
that
i
do
have
a
right,
if
the
girls
want
me
to
stay.
"
and
here's
what's
said.
"so,
i
said
to
the
girls.
"
and
i'm
reading
now
form
joint
appendix
98,
"would
you
like
me
to
leave?
"
"i
would
go
gladly,
but
otherwise,
i
feel
what
you
are
doing
is
both
wrong
and
illegal.
"
and
then,
what
happened
was,
that
she
had
brought
the
campus
policeman
down...
the
campus
policeman
had
come
and
he
said,
"you
are
under
arrest.
"
"hands
against
the
wall.
"
and
then
what
happened?
what
did
he
do?
"the
girls
were
aghast,
and
my
hands
against
the
wall,
and
then
he
handcuffed
me,
and
by
this
time,
a
crowd
of
students
was
gathering,
and
he
marched
me
out
of
the
dorm,
leaving
all
my
things
behind,
went
down
to
the
public
safety
building
and,
still
handcuffed,
they
put
me
in
a
chair,
in
the
middle
of
a
room,
and
he
said
to
the
one,
another
policeman,
"watch
her".
"
now,
the
next
day,
your
honor,
the
next
day,
your
honors,
she
went
back.
she
was
very
disturbed
by
this
incident.
she
had
been
there.
the
girls
had
asked
her
to
come.
they
wanted
her
to
come.
they
were
interested
in
what
she
had
to
tell
them
about
the
information
and
the
product
that
she
was
offering.
and,
she
said...
so,
she
described
what
happened.
and,
she
met
with
one
group,
and
then
she
said
as
she
was
going
down
the
hallway,
she
said,
"they
were
very
indignant
about
what
had
happened,
and
about
being
in
a
place
where
they
were
denied
their
constitutional
rights.
"
"and
we
were
talking
about
it,
and
they
were
writing
up
a
petition,
when,
all
of
a
sudden,
down
the
hall,
came
two
suny
policemen,
marching
down
the
hall,
and
came
up
to
the
door
where
i
had
been,
knocked
on
the
door,
and
said.
"
we
understand
katy
rapp
is
here.
"then,
the
girls,
not
knowing
what
to
do,
said
she
wasn't.
"
and
at
that
point,
kathy
rapp
said,
"that's
not
the
way
to
handle
this
matter.
"
she
said,
"and
i
said",
well,
this
is
not
the
way
to
conduct
this
to
the
other
girls
in
the
room.
"so,
i
opened
the
door,
and
i
said.
"
you
know,
here
i
am,
"to
the
guards,
to
the
policemen.
"
"are
you
looking
for
me?
"
"and,
he
said.
"
you
are
persona
non
grata
on
this
campus.
"and,
i
was
told
if
you
were
back
here,
you
would
be
subject
to
arrest
for
criminal
trespass.
"
mr.
henry
t.
reath
yes.
now,
the
point
that
i
think
you
have
to
agree,
that
that
is
an
incredible
way
to
treat
a
situation--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--no,
i
am
not,
your
honor.
i'm
explaining
that
under
those
circumstances--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--no,
i
think
the
issue,
your
honor,
is--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--and,
or
did
that
infringe
the
student's
rights
to
invite
people
to
come
to
their
room,
to
use
their
room
as
their
private
space
in
which
to
receive
information?
mr.
henry
t.
reath
i
understand.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
well,
does
that
say,
your
honor,
that
if
you,
or
anyone
else
decided
they
wanted
to
have
tupperware
party
in
their
one
time,
on
one
occasion,
that
constitutes
the
conduct
of
a
commercial
enterprise
that
violates
the
zoning?
mr.
henry
t.
reath
excuse
me?
mr.
henry
t.
reath
well,
i
think
it
certainly
takes
more
than
one.
i
think
it
takes
more
than
one.
and,
here,
you
have
the
situation,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
shows
that
this
was
a
one-time
invitation.
we
asked,
in
interpreting
this
regulation,
said
that,
"supposing
a
student
had
a
friend
who,
one
of
the
girls
and
her
daughter...
her
friend
made
sweaters.
"
"and,
she
wanted
to
come,
on
one
occasion,
and
sell
those
sweaters
in
the
dorm
room
to
other
friends.
"
"would
it
be
permitted?
"
"absolutely
not,
they
said,
because
this
constitutes
the
operation
of
a
commercial
operation,
and
i
say
that's
absurd.
"
mr.
henry
t.
reath
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
all
right.
may
i
address
that
right
now,
your
honor?
your
honor
will
recall
that
in
zauderer,
you
wrote
the
opinion,
in
which
you
tracked
the
four-part
test
of
commercial
hudson.
commercial
hudson
says
that
the
truth...
the
speech
must
be
truthful,
it
must
be...
it
must
advance
the
substantial
interest,
and
we
don't
dispute.
number
one,
the
truthfulness
is
not
involved.
they've
taken
it
out
of
the
case.
as
far
as
it
advancing
a
legitimate,
substantial
interest,
we
concede
that.
that's
not
an
issue.
the
third
question
is--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
henry
t.
reath
we
concede
that
preserving
the
academic
atmosphere,
or--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--of
course.
no
question
about
it.
of
course
it
is.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
now,
the
question,
the
question
then
comes
as
to
prong
3
and
prong
4.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
prong...
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
we
do.
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor,
the
court
below
found
that
from
the
evidence.
the
court
below,
the
judge,
judge
mccurn,
found
it,
and
also
the
second
circuit
averted
to
it.
i
can
direct
your
honors
attention
to
that
finding.
because
the
one
on
preserving
education
atmosphere...
your
honor
asked
the
question
about
studying.
and
the
testimony
was
that
at
suny,
that
there
is
little
or
no
studying
done
in
the
dorm
rooms.
nor
surprisingly.
and,
here,
your
honor,
and
this
is
why
the
university
has
backed
off
that
argument
of
academic
atmosphere.
here's
what
the
handbook
says.
here's
what
the
handbook
that
the
university
distributes
to
all
the
new
students...
it
says,
and
it's
undisputed.
"blaring
televisions
and
bickering
statements
do
not
a
happier
student
make.
"
"distraction
is
the
most
common
problem
when
you
study
in
your
room.
"
"and
it
is
a
safe
bet
that
you
will
accomplish
absolutely
nothing
in
your
dorm.
"
now,
the
point
is...
of
course,
there
are
ways
to
preserve
educational
atmosphere,
but,
your
honors,
the
dorm
room,
the
residential
dorm
room,
is
nothing
more
than
a
boarding
room
in
a
boarding
house--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--that's
a
very
interesting
question,
your
honor,
that
i
don't
think
the
court
has
to
meet.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
i
can't...
i
don't
believe
the
university--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--no,
i
think,
your
honor,
would
agree
with
me
that
there
wouldn't
be
many
universities
existing
if
they
had
such
a
rule.
i
suppose
that
if
they
wanted
to,
to
turn
their
dorm
room
into
a
monastic
cell,
that
they
probably
might
have
the
power
to
do
that.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
if
they
did
everybody.
but
the
point
is,
that
they
cannot
discriminate,
your
honor.
they
cannot
make
a
distinction
here
between
social
guests
and
business
guests.
and,
that's
what
they
do
without
any
justification,
and
justice
white,
if
i
may,
that
brings
us
to
the
fourth
prong
of
the
commercial
hudson,
which
is
what
you
wanted
to
hear
about.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
and,
we're
there.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
i
don't
believe
they
can,
sir.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
your
honor,
this
is
products
that
are
sold
on
a
hope
chest
concept,
whereby
the
young
people...
the
argument
is
made
to
them.
"look,
instead
of
wasting
your
money
on
pizzas
and
movies
and
junk
food,
save
your
money.
"
"now's
the
time
to
buy...
it's
not
only
cookware,
it's--
"
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
henry
t.
reath
well,
it's
very
remote,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
the
evidence
shows...
the
evidence
shows,
your
honor,
that
in
these
sessions,
there
is
a
lot
of
informational...
a
lot
of
information
given
about
nutrition,
about
cooking--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
henry
t.
reath
i'm
sorry?
mr.
henry
t.
reath
i
do
not
know.
i
would
suspect
that
at
some
universities
they
do.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
well,
your
honor,
it's--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--well,
your
honor,
we
are...
we're
talking
throughout
here
about
what's
called
a
tupperware
type--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--yes,
sir.
your
honor,
it's
referred
to
as
a
tupperware
type
party.
in
fact,
the
product
that
was
sold
here
was
cookware
and
china
and
tableware,
the
idea
being
to
build
up,
whether
it's
a
trousseau,
or
a
hope
chest
concept.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
they
were
fairly
substantial,
your
honor,
$500
to
a
$1,000.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
well,
it...
again,
i--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--your
honor,
the
uncontradicted
evidence
in
this
case,
and
this,
i'm
directing
to
justice
stevens,
and
the
question
of
the
least
restrictive
test
of
central
hudson.
because,
your
honor,
in
zaucerer,
and
i
might
point
out--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--not
central
hudson
didn't,
your
honor,
but
the...
you
said
it--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--well,
i
was
talking
about
zauderer.
zauderer
is...
central
hudson
says
the
least
restrictive.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
excuse
me,
"narrowly
tailored",
or
that
is
not--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--a
less
restrictive
measure...
a
less
restrictive
measure
will
do.
now,
your
honor--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
"narrowly
tailored",
and
it
also
talks
about
a
lesser
restriction.
now,
your
honor,
in
zaucerer--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--i
think
it
does,
your
honor.
and,
i
would
remind
the
court
that
in
the
central-hudson
test,
your
honor,
was
"no
more
extensive
than
necessary".
and,
if
it's
to
be
no
more
extensive
than
necessary,
the
counterpoint
to
that,
i
submit
is,
the
least
restrictive,
and
that's
precisely
what
this
court
said
in
zauderer.
and,
may
i
read,
your
honor,
from
the
court's
opinion,
which,
which
justice
white,
you
wrote.
and
there,
they
were
talking
about
the
ban
of
the
state
bar
on
commercial...
on
commercial
illustrations,
and
what
the
court
said
was,
"the
burden
is
on
the
state
to
present
a
substantial
government
interest,
justifying
the
restriction
as
applied
to
appellant,
and
to
demonstrate
that
the
restriction
vindicates
the
interest
through
the
least
restrictive
available
means.
"
now,
the
evidence
shows
here,
your
honor,
that
the
overwhelming
majority
of
colleges
and
universities
in
the
country
solved
this
problem
in
a
very
simple
way.
they
say,
"we
will
let
the
students
decide.
"
and
may
i
read
to
the
court
from
the
rule
that
is
followed
in
the
university
of
illinois,
which
is
representative
of
the
rules
that
are
used
in
the
mainstream
of
the
universities
throughout
the
country,
and
here's
what
it
says,
and
it's
so
simple.
it's
easier
to
read
than
it
is
to
try
to
summarize.
and
it
says
this,...
now,
wait
a
minute,
i'm
sorry,
where
is
it...
where
is
the
rule?
the
essence
of
the
rule
is
this:
"one,
we
will
not
allow
any
itinerant
peddlers
on
to
roam
the
halls.
"
and
we
support
that.
no
peddling
or
uninvited
solicitation,
that
is
out.
here
it
is.
i'm
reading
from
the
record
at
ja-93.
"sales
representatives
of
commercial
activities
are
not
allowed
to
go
door
to
door.
"
we
support
that.
that's
the
right,
we
believe,
the
right
way
to
handle
it.
"call
your
resident
advisor,
or
area
office
if
you
see
one
in
your
area.
"
"however,
you
may
invite
a
sales
representative
to
your
room
to
see
you,
as
your
personal
guest,
if
your
roommate
agrees.
"
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say,
"university
property
cannot
be
used
for
commercial
enterprises.
"
now--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--absolutely.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
absolutely,
your
honor.
and,
we
made
that
very
clear
in
our
brief,
and
i
make
it
very
clear
to
this
court.
we
do
not
challenge
the
university's
right
to
have
reasonable
restrictions
on
dormitories
in
use.
what
the
university
cannot
do
is
to
prohibit
lawful
speech.
they
cannot
prohibit
lawful
speech
in
the
dormitory
rooms.
if
you
think
about
it,
a
dormitory
room
is
the
student's
home.
it
is
the
only
place
where
the
student
can
retire
for
the
peace
and
privacy,
and
that
is
the
place
where
the
student
says,
"i
want
to
have
the
right
to
invite
people
of
my
choice,
to
speak
on
topics
of
my
choice,
without
the
university
putting
its
ear
to
the
keyhole
and
without
saying,.
"
"oh
yes,
you
can
come,
but
the
moment
that
you
start
talking
anything
other
than
social
activities,
the
moment
you
start
talking
about
commercal
activities,
out
you
go.
"
and,
that's
not
right,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
henry
t.
reath
absolutely.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
absolutely.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
and
in
fact,
your
honor,
the
record--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--they
have
every
right
to
do
that.
they
should
do
that.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
the
record
shows,
your
honor,
that
in
over
half
of
the
suny
universities
and
colleges,
they
have
a
checkpoint
system,
but
they
still--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
henry
t.
reath
oh,
excuse
me,
sir,
i'm
sorry.
and,
the
question
was,
can...
could
they
sell
them?
mr.
henry
t.
reath
not
at
the
state
campus.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
i
think
that
if
the
state--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--i
think
they
have
a
right
to
receive
somebody.
to
hear
their
proposition,
whether
they
are
selling
christmas
cards,
or
silk
stockings,
or
securities.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
well,
i'm
not
sure
how
that
would
fit
into
this?
mr.
henry
t.
reath
well,
your
honor,
if
it's
a
lawful
activity,
they
have
a
right
to
have
speech
relating
to
the
lawful
activity.
and,
i
think
that's
the
position
we
take.
