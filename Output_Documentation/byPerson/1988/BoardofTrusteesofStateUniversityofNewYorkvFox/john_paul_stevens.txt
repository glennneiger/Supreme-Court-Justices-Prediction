justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
sherwood,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
procedure
in
the
case?
after
the
second
circuit
decision,
the
case
went
back
and
was
tried,
and
then
you
lost
it.
was
the
district
court's
decision
on
remand
ever
reviewed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
if
in
your
view,
the
record
that
we're
permitted
to
look
at
in
deciding
this
case,
includes
what
happened
on
remand,
as
well
as
what
was
before
the
second
circuit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
we're
reviewing
the
second
circuit
decision,
we
can
rely
on
matter
that
that
court
had
never
even
seen
at
the
time
of
its
decision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
wasn't
there
another
evidentiary
hearing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
was
there
oral
argument
and
briefing
at
that
time
or--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
mean,
you
just
got
the
remand?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which,
it
just
hasn't
acted
on?
is
the
injunction
in
effect
now?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
reath,
did
he
ever...
is
there
any
testimony
that
he
ever
did
invite
an
attorney
to
his
dorm?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--are
any
of
those
commercial
speech
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
any
of
those
cases
commercial
speech
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
i
mean,
there
really
isn't...
there
is
not
an
issue
as
to
somebody
trying
to
get
a
lawyer,
who
was
frustrated,
is
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
reath,
do
you
think
the
university
could
prohibit
the
students
from
having
televisions
sets
in
their
dorm
rooms?
