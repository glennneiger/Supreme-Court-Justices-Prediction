mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
our
position
in
this
case
is
uncomplicated.
in
our
view,
the
fundamental
and
dispositive
flaw
in
petitioner's
claim
is
that
it
is
based
and
was
based
in
the
state
courts
solely
on
a
federal
statute
that
does
not
address,
and
was
not
intended
to
address,
the
subject
matter
of
petitioner's
claim.
certainly
none
of
the
statutory
language
on
which
petitioner
relies
in
terms
speaks
to
the
question
of
apportionment
methods
in
the
state
taxation
of
the
in-state
income
of
a
unitary
business.
we
may
assume,
for
purposes
of
this
case,
that
the
language
that
congress
enacted
would
suffice,
and
this
is
questionable,
but
we
may
assume
it
would
suffice,
to
have
some
effect
on
that
subject.
if
the
legislative
history
clearly
showed
that
that
was
what
congress
intended...
but
the
conspicuous
thins
about
the
legislative
history,
for
our
purposes,
is
that
no
one
discussed
or
even
adverted
to
the
question
of
apportionment
methods
in
determining
the
amount
of
a
unitary
business'
income
that
is
properly
attributable
to
its
in-state
activities
for
state
income
taxation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
the
language
were
clear
on
its
face
in
support
of
petitioner's
claim,
that
is
correct.
but
the
language
does
not,
in
our
view,
refer
in
any
way
in
terms
to
the
question
of
apportioning
the
income
of
the
unitary
business,
for
purposes
of
determining
the
amount
attributable
to
its
in-state
activities.
and
that
subject,
having
been
omitted
from
the
legislative
history,
it
is
a
subject
that
the
court
is
familiar
with.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
but
this
court's
decisions
dealing
with
the
subject
of
unitary
taxation
are
all
premised
on
the
notion
that
the
taxes
are
not
being
applied
extraterritorially,
to
something
outside
the
states's
borders.
it
is
just
a
method
of
more
accurately
determining
how
much
of
a
unitary
business'
income
is
properly
attributable
to
its
in-state
activities,
because
of
what
the
court
has
called
the
theoretical
weaknesses
of
separate
geographical
accounting
in
trying
to
apportion
the
income
of
a
unitary
business,
where
it
would
be
subject
to
imprecisions
and
manipulation...
these
are
words
that
the
court
has
used...
were
it
not
considered
as
a
unit
and
apportioned
according
to
the
common
apportioned
formula
methods.
now,
that
is
a
subject
that
has
occupied
tens
of
pages
in
the
united
states
courts.
it's
a
subject
of
some
complexity,
and
no
one
discussed
it
in
the
course
of
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute.
instead,
the
entire
controversy
in
the
evolution
and
enactment
of
the
provisions
of
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act,
that
are
at
issue
here,
concern
the
question
of
the
proper
relation
between
federal
law
and
the
law
of
the
immediately
adjacent
state
in
territorial
governance
of
the
outer
continental
shelf,
a
question
to
which
congress
turned
in
the
wake
of
this
court's
decisions,
holding
that
that
was
federal,
rather
than
state,
territory.
and
with
respect
to
the
particular
subject
of
income
taxation,
the
controversy
before
congress
never
extended
beyond
the
question
whether
the
adjacent
state
should
be
allowed
to
tax
income
from
activities
on
the
outer
continental
shelf
as
if
those
activities
had
occurred
within
the
state
itself.
that
is
not
what
iowa
has
done,
and
is
not
the
question
here.
and,
i
specifically
include
the
one
snippet
of
the
legislative
history
that
shell
particularly
relies
on...
senator
long's
statement
on
the
floor...
and
i'm
perfectly
willing
to
look
at
it
as
quoted
in
the
appellant's
blue
brief,
on
the
merits,
page
31,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
of
text.
senator
long...
this
is
the
fourth
line
from
the
bottom
of
that
page...
senator
long
recognized
that
ocs
lessees
would
be
"subject
neither
to
the
state
severance
tax,
property
tax,
nor
the
tax
on
corporate
profits.
"
for
all
that
appears,
all
he
was
referring
to
were
three
categories
of
tax
that
proponents
of
alternative
bills
wanted
the
adjacent
state
to
be
able
to
apply
directly
to
the
outer
continental
shelf,
as
if
that
were
part
of
their
territory,
as
many
states
had
treated
it
prior
to
this
court's
decisions
holding
it
to
be
federal
territory.
that
was
what
the
controversy
was
about...
whether
they
should
be
allowed
to
exercise
taxing
jurisdiction
over
this
territory
by
grant
of
that
authority
by
congress,
whether
the
effect
on
the
state
power
to
tax
that
followed
from
this
court's
decisions
would
be
overruled
by
legislation.
that
was
the
controversy.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
issue.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
but
in
context,
there's
nothing
to
indicate
that
senator
long
was
talking
about
anything
other
than
a
tax
being
imposed
by
the
adjacent
state,
either
a
severance
tax,
a
property
tax,
or
an
income
tax,
on
the
activities
on
the
shelf,
as
if
those
were
still
to
be
considered
part
of
the
state's
territory,
subject
to
the
state's
jurisdiction.
so,
our
conclusion
is
that
the
iowa
supreme
court
correctly
held
that
the
federal
statute
does
not
address
the
apportionment
issue
that
was
before
that
court,
and
that
that
issue
therefore
continues
to
be
governed
only
by
this
court's
decisions
under
the
due
process
and
commerce
clauses,
and
by
state
law.
and
i
might
say,
about
state
law,
that
many
of
the
states,
including
iowa
and
florida,
whose
case
is
being
held
for
this
one,
in
applying
their
apportionment
formulas
start,
in
basing
the
total
income
subject
to
the
formula,
with
federal
taxable
income.
and
that,
we
know
from
the
internal
revenue
service,
includes
income
derived
from
all
portions
of
united
states
territory,
including
federal
enclaves
within
the
states.
if
oil
is
produced
on
an
indian
reservation
or
a
federal
petroleum
reserve,
all
of
that
would
normally
be
included
in
the
apportionment
formula,
and
income
derived
from
operations
on
the
outer
continental
shelf
would
ordinarily
be
included.
so,
this
statute,
in
our
view,
does
not
address
that
question,
and
since
no
constitutional
claim
has
been
raised,
the
judgement
of
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
should
be
affirmed.
