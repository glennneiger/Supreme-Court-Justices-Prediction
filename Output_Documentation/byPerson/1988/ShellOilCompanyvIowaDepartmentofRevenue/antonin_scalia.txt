i
didn't
take
it
as
grossly
overstating
it.
i
took
it
as
carrying
it
to
its
logical
conclusion.
if
you
say
that
the
objective
was
to
prevent
the
states
from
cutting
in
on
the
exclusive
federal
power
to
derive
funds
from
the
shelf,
surely
they
cut
in
when
whatever
gas
and
oil
you
get
from
the
shelf
can
be
taxed
as
soon
as
it's
sold
on
the
mainland.

the
point
is,
that
you're
not
drawing
the
line
simply
on
the
basis
of
what
the
economic
reality
is.

or
by
you,
in
montana
or
missouri.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
carted
it
yourself
and
sold
it
in
montana,
you'd
still
pay
a
sales
tax?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
economic
reality
of
that
is
that
it
renders
the
gas
and
oil
that
you
take
off
the
shelf
somewhat
less
valuable
than
it
otherwise
would
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
before
you
go
on
to
the
next
point,
isn't
there
a
better
explanation
than
it's
just
a
superabundance
of
caution,
to
say
it
twice?
that
phrase
"state
taxation
laws
shall
not
apply
to
the
outer
continental
shelf.
"
comes
at
the
end
of
a
paragraph
that
specifies
at
the
beginning
that
the
civil
and
criminal
laws
of
each
adjacent
state
now
in
effect
or
hereafter
adopted
are
declared
to
be
the
law
of
the
united
states
for
that
portion.
so
it
follows,
one
could
argue,
on
the
basis
of
that,
that
all
laws
are
either
civil
or
criminal,
and
therefore
the
tax
laws
apply
there.
and
it
comes
at
the
end
of
that
paragraph,
and
it
says
"state
taxation
laws
shall
not
apply.
"
justice

i
wouldn't
consider
that
particularly
redundant.
i
would
consider
it
eliminating
what
might
otherwise
be
an
implication
of
(2)(a)
that
state
taxation
laws
of
the
adjacent
states
could
apply.
