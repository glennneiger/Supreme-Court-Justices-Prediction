mr.
harry
m.
griger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
my
argument
discusses
three
points
as
to
why
iowa's
apportioned
tax
is
not
in
conflict
with
the
cuter
continental
shelf
lands
act.
first,
absent
extraterritorial
taxation
that
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment's
due
process
clause,
or
the
commerce
clause,
state
unitary
apportioned
taxation
is
not
the
exercise
of
state
political
jurisdiction
outside
the
taxing
state,
but
only
inside.
second,
43
u.s.c.
section
1331(a)
which
is
found
on
pages
94(a)
to
95(a)
of
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement
precludes
state
political
jurisdiction
in
the
outer
continental
shelf
by
a
taxing
state,
but
not
inside
the
taxing
state.
and
third,
the
1978
outer
continental
shelf
amendments
are
inapplicable
to
this
case.
with
respect
to
my
first
point,
the
unitary
business
formal
apportionment
method
is
a
method
for
division
of
multi-state
unitary
income
within
and
without
the
state.
it
is
designed
to
tax
that
income
which
is
reasonably
attributable
to
the
taxing
state
as
a
result
of
the
taxpayers'
activities
that
occur
there.
unlike
separate
accounting,
it
recognizes
that
there
are
unquantifiable
factors
of
profitability
which
arise
from
the
unitary
business
as
a
whole,
rather
than
from
merely
any
particular
segment,
and
that
these
factors
of
profitability
contribute
as
a
whole
to
the
earnings
of
the
entire
unitary
income.
its
design
is
to
value
the
income-producing
activities
in
the
taxing
state,
not
outside.
my
second
point
is
with
respect
to
section
1333,
subparagraph
(a),
which
obviously
is
a
key
statute
in
this
case.
we
contend
that
the
statute
precludes
state
political
jurisdiction
over
the
shelf,
but
not
off
the
shelf.
section
1333(a),
subparagraph
(1)
provides
for
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction
on
the
outer
continental
shelf,
but
such
language
does
not
preclude
reasonable
apportionment
income
attribution
to
the
taxing
state.
the
second
subsection,
which
is
subsection
(a),
sub
(2),
sub
(a),
provides
that
applicable
and
not
inconsistent
adjacent
state
law
is
adopted
as
surrogate
federal
law.
within
the
context
of
that
paragraph
that
says
that,
the
last
sentence
states
that
state
taxation
laws
shall
not
apply
to
the
outer
continental
shelf.
now,
one
who
reads
that
for
the
first
time
could
understandably
get
the
impression
that
that
simply
means
that
adjacent
state
tax
laws
shall
not
be
adopted
as
surrogate
federal
law.
however,
one
could
also
read
the
language
to
confirm
that
there
is
no
state
political
jurisdiction
to
be
exercised
in
the
outer
continental
shelf.
the
language
does
not
preclude
a
state
from
exercising
its
taxing
jurisdiction
off
the
shelf,
which
has
occurred
in
this
case.
the
legislative
history
with
respect
to
this
taxation
language
denotes
that
there
was
a
battle
in
the
congress
between
proponents,
primarily
from
louisiana
and
from
texas
who
wanted
to
extend
their
territorial
jurisdiction
to
the
outer
continental
shelf
to
impose
primarily
their
severance
taxes
there,
and
opponents
of
state
taxation
who
resisted
such
extension
as
unconstitutional
extraterritorial
taxation.
senator
cordon
in
explaining
the
conference
bill
to
the
senate,
stated
that
the
language
[inaudible]
state
taxation
laws
do
not
apply
to
the
outer
continental
shelf
really
added
nothing
to
the
bill.
it
was
already
covered
in
other
provisions
of
the
statute
with
respect
to
absence
of
state
political
jurisdiction
on
the
outer
continental
shelf.
indeed,
this
court
in
the
gulf
offshore
case
stated
with
respect
to
the
third
subsection
here,
section
1333(a)(3),
that
provides
that
nothing
in
the
prior
subsection,
which
provides
for
adoption
of
adjacent
state
law
as
federal
law,
can
be
used
by
a
state
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
the
outer
continental
shelf
of
itself
precluded
any
state
taxation
laws
from
being
extended
to
the
outer
continental
shelf.
therefore,
the
language
"state
taxation
laws
shall
not
apply
to
the
outer
continental
shelf.
"
really
added
nothing
to
the
bill,
but
according
to
senator
cordon,
was
insisted
by
the
house
conferees
out
of
a
superabundance
of
caution.
and
my
third
point
is
that
the
1978
cuter
continental
shelf
act
amendments
are
simply
inapplicable
to
the
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
harry
m.
griger
that
is
certainly
one
interpretation.
mr.
harry
m.
griger
that's
certainly
an
interpretation.
the
language
comes
from
a
house
amendment
to
the
house
bill
by
representative
keating.
and
he
wanted
to
confirm
that
the
states
will
not
extend
their
territorial
jurisdiction
through
taxation
to
the
outer
continental
shelf,
and
therefore
he
wanted
that
language
in
the
act.
and
they
chose
to
place
it
in
that
particular
paragraph.
mr.
harry
m.
griger
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
do
you
mean
if
we
had
a
separate
accounting
computation
of
income
in
iowa
without
regard
to
apportionment,
attributing
income?
mr.
harry
m.
griger
no,
because
we
would
be
taxing
too
much.
we
would
probably
be
arrogating
income
from
outside
the
state
without
apportionment.
mr.
harry
m.
griger
we
would
be
extraterritorially
applying
our
tax
laws--
mr.
harry
m.
griger
--sorry,
your
honor.
if
we
just
would
tax
sales
made
in...
i
misunderstood
your
original
question.
if
we
just
imposed
a
tax
on
sales
made
in
iowa,
there
is
no
problem,
in
my
opinion,
with
violating
the
cuter
continental
shelf
act.
mr.
harry
m.
griger
no,
i
don't
see
the
problem.
we
could
impose
a
property
tax,
for
example,
on
the
storage
of
outer
continental
shelf
oil
or
gas
stored
in
the
state.
we
could
impose
a
sales
tax
or
some
sort
of
occupation
tax
on
that
particular
oil
and
gas
sold.
the
key
is
don't
discriminate
against
it.
as
long
as
we
have
a
non-discriminatory
tax,
our
[inaudible]
is
not
on
the
outer
continental
shelf,
it's
in
the
state
of
iowa.
mr.
harry
m.
griger
i
agree,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
geller
has
conceded,
in
page
6
of
his
reply
brief,
that
iowa
could
impose
such
a
property
tax
in
iowa,
impose
that
on
outer
continental
shelf
oil
and
gas.
the
concepts
are
no
different,
because
the
problem
is,
you
have
a
unitary
business.
and
because
it's
a
unitary
business,
formula
apportionment
is
generally
an
acceptable
way
of
attributing
the
income
within
the
state,
recognizing
that
activities
from
the
entire
business
contribute
to
the
earning
of
income.
but
what
we
are
trying
to
do
is
simply
attribute
income
in
reasonable
proportions
to
shell's
activities
in
iowa,
and
as
mr.
geller
has
stated,
they
don't
contend
that
we've
done
otherwise.
my
third
point
is
with
respect
to
the
1978
ocs
amendments.
those
amendments
were
designed
to
procure
a
fair
return
to
the
federal
government
while
at
the
same
time
be
fair
to
oil
producers
in
increasing
funds
for
exploration.
now,
the
problem
that
these
amendments
were
dealing
with
was
the
cash
bonus,
fixed
royalty
method
of
leasing
in
the
outer
continental
shelf
by
the
federal
government
with
huge
front-end
payments.
these
payments
were
so
large
that
they
literally
kept
down
competition
in
the
shelf
for
lease
bidding.
only
a
few
of
the
major
oil
companies
could
afford
the
bids,
and
indeed,
the
legislative
history
shows
at
the
senate
hearings
they
complained...
even
some
of
the
majors
complained,
such
as
humble,
standard
oil...
complained
that
the
amounts
that
they
had
to
pay
in
terms
of
the
front-end
costs
were
very
high.
it
also
led
to
low
bids.
there
was
an
example
in
the
legislative
history
where
one
company
bid
$144,000
for
a
tract
that
had
a
potential
value
of
$20
million,--
finally,
it
kept
small
producers
off
the
shelf
entirely,
because
they
couldn't
afford
the
huge,
front-end
bids.
the
congressional
response
to
that
was
to
amend
section
1337
to
provide
for
alternative
bidding,
which
is
discussed
by
this
court
in
the
watt
case.
now
note
that
state
taxes
were
never
mentioned.
they're
not
mentioned
in
the
statute,
the
1978
amendments,
they're
not
mentioned
in
the
legislative
history,
and
ocs
producers
at
this
time
had
been
paying
apportioned
state
taxes.
in
fact,
shell
had,
as
denoted
on
page
47
of
the
joint
appendix.
therefore,
in
conclusion,
shell's
challenge
to
the
makeup
of
the
unitary
net
income
base
subject
to
apportionment
as
in
conflict
with
the
cuter
continental
shelf
lands
act
should
be
rejected,
and
the
decision
of
the
iowa
supreme
court
should
be
affirmed.
