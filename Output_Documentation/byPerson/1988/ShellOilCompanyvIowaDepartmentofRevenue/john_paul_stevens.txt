mr.
geller,
let
me
just
get
one
little
detail.
you
don't
disagree
with
the
proposition
that
these
activities
on
the
outer
continental
shelf
are
part
of
the
unitary
business?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
geller,
i
guess
under
your
theory
you're
saying
it
doesn't
get
into
the
pie
at
all,
but
it
would
at
least
be
involved
in
the
sense
that
the
sales
of
these
petroleum
products
would
go
into
computing
both...
the
percentage
figure,
because
those
sales,
when
the
stuff
is
ultimately
sold,
will
be
part
of
sales
everywhere,
wouldn't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
your
view
was
the
percentage
wouldn't
change,
you
just
want
to
take
it
out
of
the
pie.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
income
base.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
on
sales...
i'm
not
talking
about
the
sale
on
the
shelf.
i
understand
that's
a
small
part
of
it.
i
understand
the
petroleum
extracted
on
the
shelf,
and
then
sent
around
the
country,
and
ultimately
sold
in
iowa
and
every
place
else
in
the
united
states...
those
sales
would
still
be
included
in
the
calculation
of
the
percentage?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
don't
say
the
statutory
language
forecloses
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wallace?
mr.
wallace,
it
is
true,
is
it
not,
that
the
iowa
tax,
being
enforced
or
imposed
in
this
case,
is
a
tax
on
shell's
corporate
profits?
