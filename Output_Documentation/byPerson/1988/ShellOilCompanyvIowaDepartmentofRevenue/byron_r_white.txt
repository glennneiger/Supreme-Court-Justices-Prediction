suppose
the
state
didn't
use
an
apportionment
formula,
but
they
just
arrived
at
the
income
earned
in
the
state
by
just
counting
up
the
actual
sales
of
oil
and
gas
in
iowa,
and
figuring

what
the
income
was
from
those
sales.
and
obviously,
they
would

that
calculation

portion
of
the
sales
made
in
iowa
involved
sales
of
outer

justice
byron

if
that's
the
case,
you
would
think
that
a
state

justice

do
you
think
a
gross
receipts
tax
in
iowa
