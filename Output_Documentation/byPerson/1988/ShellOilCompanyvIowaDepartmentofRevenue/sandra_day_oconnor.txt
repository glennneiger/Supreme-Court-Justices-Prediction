well,
i
guess
the
concern,
mr.
geller,
is
whether
the
statutory
provisions
are
really
directed
toward
taxes
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state,
such
as
property
taxes
or
excise
taxes,
severance
taxes,
and
so
forth.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
exactly.
and
it
isn't
all
that
clear
to
me
that
congress
had
in
mind
prohibiting
any
reference
in
an
apportionment
formula
to
ocs
wellhead
value
gas.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
for
the
objective
of
determining
what
income
was
earned
in
iowa.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
was
also
made
by
an
opponent
to
the
legislation,
mr.
geller.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
we
don't
often
place
great
reliance
on
that
kind
of
a
remark.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
its
theory,
of
course,
is
that
it's
only
taxing
income
in
the
state.
that's
its
theory.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
as
a
reference
point
to
determine
what
share
belongs
to
iowa,
i
guess.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
wallace,
i
guess
if
the
language
is
clear
on
its
face,
we
don't
get
to
the
legislative
history.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
it
used
broad
language,
"state
taxation
laws
shall
not
apply.
"
