chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
on
number
87-984,
shell
oil
company
versus
the
iowa
department
of
revenue.
we'll
wait
just
a
moment,
mr.
geller.
very
well.
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
tell
me
again,
mr.
geller,
how
that
computation
was
made.
shell
has
certain
income
which,
from
sales
resulting
from
production
in
the
ocs?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
wouldn't
think
that
was
income
in
the
ordinary
sense.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--so
iowa
is
telling
it
to
figure
your
iowa
tax
by
putting
iowa
sales
as
the
numerator
and
all
sales
as
a
denominator?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
but
if
preparation
of
either
the
numerator
or
the
denominator,
do
those
ocs
figures--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
listen
to
my
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
asking
you,
in
preparing
the
numerator
and
the
denominator
of
sales
over
sales,
do
the
ocs,
outer
continental
shelf,
values
come
into
the
calculation
of
either
of
those
two?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
isn't
your
primary
objection.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
net
income
base
is
shell's
net
income
everywhere,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
that
include
net
income
in
the
east
indies
and
places
like
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
there's
no
question,
i
suppose,
that
iowa
could
not
directly
tax
something
that
was
produced
in
the
east
indies.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
surely
doesn't
speak
precisely
to
this
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
probably
why
we
first
turned
to
the
language
of
the
statue
itself,
and
only
as
a
last
resort
to
comments
on
the
floor,
because
they
are
seldom
very
precise,
and
certainly
this
one
does
not
strike
me
as
hitting
the
nail
on
the
head.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
geller,
does
the
federal
government
have
oil
leases
on
property
that
it
owns,
other
than
the
ocs
lands?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no
government
public
lands
are
subject
to
oil
leases?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
know.
no
other
government
public
lands?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
come
to
think
of
it,
what
about
eir
hills
and
teapot
dome
and
some
of
those?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
any
of
those,
is
there
a
prohibition
against...
that
could
be
interpreted
as
prohibiting
the
use
of
such...
profits
from
those
such
as
iowa
makes
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
geller.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
griger.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
griger.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
geller,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
geller.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
87-984,
shell
oil
company
versus
iowa
department
of
revenue
will
be
announced
by
justice
marshall.
