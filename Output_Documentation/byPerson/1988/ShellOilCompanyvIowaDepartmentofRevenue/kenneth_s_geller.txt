mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
state
of
iowa
may
tax
the
income
earned
by
shell
oil
company
in
the
extraction
of
oil
and
gas
from
the
outer
continental
shelf.
simply
stated,
iowa
requires
shell
to
take
its
ocs
earnings
into
account
in
figuring
out
its
iowa
income
tax
liability,
with
the
result
being
that
the
more
money
shell
earns
on
the
outer
continental
shelf,
the
more
iowa
income
tax
it
generally
pays.
it's
our
position
that
state
taxation
of
this
sort
is
prohibited
by
the
language,
the
legislative
history,
and
the
purposes
and
policies
of
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act,
which
demonstrate,
we
believe,
that
congress
meant
to
prohibit
the
states
from
taxing
any
portion
of
ocs
revenue.
iowa,
on
the
other
hand,
contends
that
the
act
contains
an
implied
exception
for
apportioned
income
taxes.
let
me
begin
by
briefly
explaining
the
background
of
this
dispute.
shell
engages
in
substantial
exploration
for
oil
and
gas
on
the
outer
continental
shelf,
pursuant
to
federal
leases.
now,
it's
relatively
easy
for
shell
to
figure
out
its
net
income
from
these
ocs
operations,
because
the
oil
and
gas
has
a
definite
and
easily
ascertainable
fair
market
value
at
the
wellhead,
and
shell
also
knows
what
its
expenses
are
in
extracting
the
oil
and
gas
from
the
shelf.
in
fact,
shell
has
to
figure
out,
make
these
precise
calculations
for
a
number
of
federal
purposes,
such
as
the
windfall
profits
tax,
the
oil
depletion
allowances,
and
most
importantly,
in
figuring
out
the
amount
it
owes
to
the
federal
government
as
royalties
on
these
federal
leases.
now,
shell
also
does
business
in
iowa,
and
as
a
result,
it's
subject
to
iowa's
corporate
income
tax.
now,
iowa,
like
virtually
every
state,
determines
the
income
tax
liability
for
a
multi-state
business
through
use
of
a
formula
apportionment
method.
it
starts
with
the
corporation's
federal
income
tax
base,
its
net
income
for
federal
income
tax
purposes,
and
it
then
subtracts
from
that
federal
income
tax
amounts
that
it
either
can't
constitutionally
tax,
such
as
items
that
may
not
be
part
of
the
unitary
business,
or
items
that
congress
by
statute
has
prohibited
it
from
taxing,
such
as,
for
example,
the
interest
on
federal
securities.
now,
what
is
left
then
is
the
iowa
income
tax
base.
then
multiplies
that
by
a
percentage...
in
most
states,
that
percentage
is
based
on
three
factors
of
payroll,
property
and
sales.
as
the
court
is
aware
from
its
decision
in
poorman,
iowa
uses
a
one
factor
sales
formula
with
the
numerator
being
sales
in
iowa,
and
the
denominator
being
sales
everywhere.
then
multiplies
that
iowa
income
base
by
this
fraction,
and
it
comes
up
with
the
corporation's
iowa
taxable
income.
now,
when
shell
computed
its
iowa
income
for
the
years
in
question,
it
subtracted
from
its
federal
income
base
the
amounts
it
earned
from
the
extraction
of
oil
and
gas
from
the
outer
continental
shelf,
and
it
did
that
based
on
the
provisions
of
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act,
which
provide
"state
taxation
laws
shall
not
apply
to
the
outer
continental
shelf.
"
and
as
the
court
will
know
from
the
table
reproduced
at
footnote
seven
at
page
10
of
our
brief,
when
shell's
ocs
income
was
not
subjected
to
the
provisions
of
iowa's
income
tax
laws,
it
made
a
substantial
difference
in
shell's
iowa
income
tax
liability.
now,
the
state
challenged
the
way
in
which--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--not
from
sales,
mr.
chief
justice.
shell
has
certain
income
that
it
earns
on
the
shelf
from
the
very
act
of
extracting
the
oil
and
gas
from
the
ocean
floor
and
bringing
it
to
the
surface.
it
has
a
wellhead
value.
and
shell
also
knows--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
it's
not
realized
income
for
purposes
of
paying
an
income
tax
on
it
at
that
moment,
but
it
is
treated
as
a
sales
equivalent
or
income
for
a
number
of
federal
purposes,
as
i
said
earlier,
including
the
windfall
profits
tax
and
depletion
allowances,
and
most
importantly,
figuring
out
the
royalties
it
owes
to
the
federal
government,
which
is
based
not
on
any
subsequent
sales
that
may
occur,
but
on
the
net
wellhead
value.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
value
of
the
oil
at
the
shelf.
that's
correct.
that
is
the
earning...
that
is
the
amount
that
shell
claims
it
earns
from
its
ocs
operations.
the
wellhead
value
less
whatever
expenses
were
incurred
in
bringing
that
oil
and
gas
to
the
surface.
that
is
the
amount
that
it
claims--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes,
and
multiplying
that
by
an
income
base
that
includes
the
amounts
that
i
just
referred
to...
the
amounts
that
shell
earns
from
the
extraction
of
oil
and
gas
on
the
outer
continental
shelf.
it's
crucial
that
we're
talking
here
about
the
a
income
base...
what
must
be
included
in
that
base.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
ocs...
well,
as
i
said,
iowa
uses
a
one-factor
formula--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
they
do.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
they
wouldn't
come
into
the
numerator,
which
is
iowa
sales.
they
come
into
the
denominator.
any
sales
that
shell
makes
on
the
shelf
itself...
and
it
sells
a
small
quantity
of
oil
and
gas
on
the
shelf...
would
be
included
in
its
everywhere
sales,
which
would
be
in
the
denominator.
of
course,
we
object
to
that
as
well,
because
we
claim
that
what
congress
meant
to
do
in
passing
the
statute
is
to
require
the
states
to
simply
ignore
any
ocs
values.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
our
primary
objection
is
the
use
in
the
income
base
of
the
net
wellhead
value
that
shell
earns
from
the
extraction
of
oil
and
gas
from
the
outer
continental
shelf.
that's
what
we
object
to.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
income
base
is
shell's
net
income
everywhere,
which
we
claim
should
not
include
its
net
income
on
the
outer
continental
shelf.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
in
those
states
that
require
worldwide
computations,
it
does,
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
correct.
on
the
other
hand,
there's
no
federal
statute,
either,
that
tells
them
they
can't
do
that,
and
we
claim
that
there's
a
federal
statute
here.
i
think
it's
important
in
light
of
that
statement,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
begin
by
emphasizing
that
this
case
is
quite
different
from
a
number
of
other
state
income
tax
cases
that
the
court
has
wrestled
with
in
recent
years.
this
case
doesn't
involve
any
constitutional
challenge
to
iowa's
apportionment
method.
therefore,
many
of
the
arguments
in
iowa's
brief
about
nexus
or
extraterritorial
taxation
or
its
citations
and
reliance
on
cases
like
moorman
or
exxon
v.
hisconsin
are,
we
think,
quite
irrelevant
here.
iowa
may
well
have
a
constitutional
power
to
tax
the
earnings
that
shell
makes
on
the
outer
continental
shelf.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we
don't
dispute
that,
justice
stevens.
what
we
contend
is
not
that
there's
any
constitutional
restriction
on
iowa's
power
to
tax
what
shell
earns
on
the
outer
continental
shelf,
but
that
congress
has
added
an
additional
restriction
by
statute,
in
order
to
protect
and
promote
operations
on
an
exclusively
federal
enclave,
are
outer
continental
shelf.
we
believe
that
this
conclusion
follows
from
three
crucial
pieces
of
evidence.
and
the
first,
of
course,
is
the
language
of
the
statute
itself.
and
as
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
section
1333(a)(2)
of
title
43
provides...
and
i
quote...
"state
taxation
laws
shall
not
apply
to
the
outer
continental
shelf.
"
and
this
language
is
reinforced
by
section
1333(a)(3)
of
the
statute,
which
states
that
subsection
(a)(2),
which
i
just
read
to
you,
shall
never
be
interpreted
in
such
a
way
as
to
allow
the
states
to
claim
any
share
of
the
revenues
from
ocs
mineral
production.
but
that
of
course
is
precisely
what
iowa
is
trying
to
do
here
by
insisting
that
shell
include
its
ocs
earning
in
its
iowa
income
base.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
right.
that
is
the
dispute
between
us
and
iowa.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
we
think
that
congress--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
we
think,
as
i
said,
that
there
are
three
reasons
why
congress
a
did
include
a
comprehensive
prohibition
on
state
income
tax.
the
first,
as
i
was
just
referring
to,
is
the
language
of
the
statute,
which
is
categorical.
it
talks
about
state
taxation
laws.
it
doesn't
make
any
distinctions
between
jurisdiction
based
laws
and
apportioned
income
taxation.
it
speaks
generally
of
state
taxation
laws.
and
i
think
that
the
legislative
history
bears
this
out,
justice
o'connor.
the
legislative
history
is
quite
long,
and
contentious,
and
we've
cited
it.
we've
discussed
it
in
brief.
congress
gave
a
lot
of
thought
to
what
it
is
doing
here.
it
seems
to
us
that
there
are
two
salient
points
that
bear
repeating
about
the
legislative
history.
the
first
is
that
bill
after
bill
after
bill
was
introduced
in
congress,
during
the
course
of
the
debates,
to
give
the
states
some
share
of
ocs
revenues,
no
matter
how
accost.
every
one
of
these
attempts
was
rejected.
legislative
leaders
in
both
houses--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
justice
kennedy,
the
focus,
curiously,
was
or
the
coastal
states,
because
the
coastal
states
had
been
the
prime
beneficiaries
under
the
prior
system,
whereby
the
states
viewed
the
outer
continental
shelf
as
their
own
land.
decisions
of
this
court
between
1947
and
1950
had
held
that
the
ocs
was
in
fact
not
state
land,
but
exclusively
federal
land.
and
therefore,
much
of
the
debates
in
the
legislative
history
were
attempts
by
the
coastal
states
to
reassert
the
jurisdiction
that
they
had
previously
exercised.
but
every
one
of
those
attempts
was
beaten
back.
and
of
course,
if
we
are
right
that
congress
comprehensively
prohibited
the
states
from
imposing
any
income
tax,
any
tax
whatsoever,
including
income
tax,
then
of
course
it
serves
to
reason
that
that
prohibition
would
apply
to
all
states,
and
not
just
the
coastal
states.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
correct.
but
it
seems
to
us
crucial
that
at
no
point
in
the
legislative
history...
at
no
point,
and
iowa
has
not
been
able
to
cite
to
any...
was
there
a
discussion
only
of
jurisdiction
based
taxes.
congress
spoke
of
all
state
taxation,
and
in
fact
the
only
mention
in
the
legislative
history
that
is
at
all
relevant
to
the
question
of
apportioned
income
taxation
points
our
way.
just
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
senator
long
of
louisiana
specifically
said
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
if
the
statute
passed
as
it
was
drafted...
and
it
ultimately
did
pass
as
it
was
drafted...
that
would
mean
that
the
states
could
not
impose
a
tax
on
corporate
profits.
he
didn't--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
it's
awfully
close
to
this
question.
we're
dealing
here
with
a
tax
on
corporate
profits.
that's
precisely
what
iowa
suggests
is
not
covered
by
the
statute.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
it
does
refer
to
a
tax
on
corporate
profits,
which
is
what
we're
dealing
with
here,
and
which
is
what
iowa
suggests
is
not
covered.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it
was
made
by
someone
who
opposed
the
legislation,
that's
true.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
we're
not
asking
the
court
to
place
great
reliance
on
it.
but
it
is
the
only
statement
in
the
legislative
history
that
focuses
on
the
precise
issue
in
this
case.
and
more
important
than
that,
no
member
of
congress
expressed
any
disagreement
with
what
senator
long
said.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
in
terms
of
constitutional
objections
to
apportioned
income
taxes,
this
court
has
said
that
what
an
apportioned
income
tax
attempts
to
do
is
to
figure
out
how
much
money
a
corporation
has
made
in
the
state
and
to
that
extent
of
the
constitutional
matter,
we're
not
suggesting
it
is
a
tax
on
the
ocs.
but
there
are
two
things
to
be
said
about
that,
justice
kennedy.
the
first
is
that
the
statue
doesn't
say
"state
taxation
laws
shall
not
apply
on
the
outer
continental
shelf.
"
it
says
"state
taxation
laws
shall
not
apply
to
the
outer
continental
shelf.
"
it
seems
to
us
that
what
congress
was
getting
at
is
that
they
didn't
want
the
states
to
tax
any
activities
that
occurred
on
the
outer
continental
shelf,
and
in
any
meaningful
sense
of
the
term,
it
seems
to
us,
congress
meant
to
say
that
if
profits
were
made
on
the
outer
continental...
after
all,
let
me
answer
it
this
way.
congress
knew
that
profits
were
going...
at
least
hoped...
profits
were
going
to
be
made
on
the
outer
continental
shelf.
that's
how
it
attempted
to
encourage
companies
to
go
out
and
develop
the
outer
continental
shelf.
now,
it's
crystal
clear
from
the
legislative
history...
and
iowa
doesn't
dispute
this...
that
congress
sale,
we
do
not
want
the
states
to
grab
any
share
of
those
profits,
through
a
severance
tax,
through
a
sales
tax,
through
an
excise
tax,
through
a
property
tax
or
even
through
an
unapportioned
income
tax.
so
the
question
really
becomes
why
would
congress
have
meant
to
make
an
exception
for
apportioned
income
taxes,
if
the
result
of
allowing
the
states
to
impose
apportioned
income
taxes
would
be
the
same
as
allowing
them
to
impose
these
other
types
of
taxes,
which
is
to
make
operations
on
the
shelf
less
profitable,
which
they
clearly
do.
it's
undisputed
in
this
case,
as
the
figures
i
referred
to
earlier
suggest,
that
the
more
profit
that
a
company
makes
on
the
outer
continental
shelf,
the
more
state
tax
it
has
to
pay.
therefore,
operations
on
the
outer
continental
shelf
are
less
profitable.
if
they're
less
profitable
because
the
states
impose
a
severance
tax,
or
an
excise
tax,
or
a
sales
tax,
congress
said
they
can't
do
it.
the
question
remains,
given
the
policies
of
the
act,
which
were
to
encourage
development
on
the
shelf,
by
in
fact
immunizing
the
income
earned
out
there,
and
to
maximize
federal
revenues,
why
would
congress
have
meant
to
exclude
this
one
type
of
taxation,
apportioned
income
taxation,
from
the
universe
of
taxes
that
they
meant
to
prohibit
the
states
from
enforcing
as
to
ocs
revenues?
now,
iowa
never
explains
why.
it
never
explains
why
its
theory
is
consistent
with
the
categorical
language
of
the
statute,
which
says
state
taxation
laws
shall
not
apply
to
the
outer
continental
shelf--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--that
is
its
theory,
justice
o'connor.
and
i
think
it's
faulty
for
the
reason
that
it
relies
heavily
on
constitutional
notions.
we're
not
suggesting
that
iowa
is
taxing
income
on
the
shelf
for
purposes
of
some
claim
that
they
don't
have
nexus,
or
its's
an
extraterritorial
type
of
taxation.
but
it
seems
to
us
that
iowa's
playing
word
games
with
the
court
by
saying
it's
not
taxing
income
on
the
shelf.
it
is
unquestionably
requiring
all
oil
companies
to
include
ocs
profits
in
figuring
out
its
state
income
tax.
when
one
considers
what
congress
intended
to
do
in
this
statute,
it's
inconceivable--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--that's
true.
now,
what
apportioned
income
taxation
does,
in
effect,
is
to
treat
all
of
the
states
as
if
they
were
a
single
taxing
entity.
and
what
apportioned
income
taxation
does
is
to
require
all
of
the
income
of
a
multi-state
corporation
to
be
amassed
in
one
pie,
and
what
apportionment
essentially
says
is
what
slice,
what,
size
slice
of
that
pie
is
each
state
entitled
to.
but
the
question
here
is
the
antecedent
one
of
what
is
to
go
into
the
pie.
and
we
think
what
congress
clearly
said
is
that
this
is
an
area
of
exclusive
federal
concern.
it's
of
no
concern
to
the
states,
the
profits
that
are
made
out
there.
none
of
that
is
to
be
included
in
the
income
pie
that
the
states
would
then--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--no,
our
position--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--no,
no,
no.
i
thought
i
said
in
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
that
what
we're
primarily
concerned
about
is
not
including
that
amount
in
the
income
base.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
for
consistency,
justice
stevens,
our
position
also
is
that
any
sales
that
occur
on
the
shelf
also
have
to
be--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--they
would
be
included
in
the
denominator.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
not
at
all.
and
i
think
one
of
the
ways
in
which
iowa
has
attempted
to
discredit
our
position
is
by
grossly
overstating
it,
to
suggest
that
we
are
saying
that
even
those
sales
must
be
excluded
from
the
computations.
i
think...
we've
never
taken
that
position.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
don't
think
so,
justice
scalia,
for
the
following
reason.
we
have
to
look
at
what
congress
meant
to
do
in
the
statute.
this
section
1331(a)(3)
is
quite
clear
as
to
the
extent
of
the
immunity
that
congress
meant
to
grant
here.
and
what
they
said
is
that
the
states
are
not
to
claim
any
interest
in
any
revenues
from
the
natural
resources
from
the
shelf.
now,
we
think
that
means
that
when
the
profit
is
earned
by
extracting
the
oil
and
gas
from
the
shelf,
and
income
is
earned,
that
is
the
amount
that
is
excluded
from
the
state
tax
computations.
now,
congress
did
not
say...
and
it
wouldn't
have
been
consistent
with
what
it
was
trying
to
do
here...
that
this
oil
and
gas
would
be
given
an
immunity
as
it
went
through
life,
if
it
was
turned
into
some
other
product,
like
petroleum,
and
it
was
subject
to
some
transaction
in
some
state,
and
the
transaction
tax
was
generally
imposed
in
that
state,
it
would
make
no
sense,
given
the
purposes
here,
to
carry
the
immunity
that
far.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we
are
drawing
the
line
on
the
basis,
we
think,
of
what
congress
meant
to
say,
which
is
if
you
earn
income
on
the
outer
continental
shelf,
from
the
extraction
of
oil
and
gas,
that
income
is
immunized
from
state
taxation.
now,
any
amount
earned
by
the
sale
by
some
unrelated
third
party
in
montana
or
missouri--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--or
by
us.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we
would
still
pay...
just
like
anyone
else,
justice
scalia
would
pay
a
sales
tax
in
that
state
for
selling
that
product.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
would
think
it
would
be
de
minimus
given
what
congress
was
trying
to...
first
of
all
there
would
be
severe
bookkeeping
problems
because
it
is
impossible
to
trace
oil
which
is
fungible.
but
what
congress
had
in
mind
is
that
the
increment
of
income
earned
from
the
extraction
of
oil
and
gas
on
the
shelf...
which
is
easily
determinable,
and
it
all
accrues
on
the
shelf
itself...
is
what
is
not
to
be
included
in
the
state
income
tax
base.
all
of
that
income
is
earned
on
an
exclusively
federal
enclave.
it's
not
a
transaction
tax
such
as
you're
referring
to
now,
which
the
states
generally
can
tax
because
it
occurs
within
their
jurisdiction
and
they
generally
tax
transactions
of
that
sort.
we're
dealing
with
something
quite
different
here.
now,
iowa's
position,
as
i
believe
justice
o'connor
referred
to
earlier,
is
to
suggest
that
the
statute
only
involves
jurisdiction-based
taxes.
now,
there
are
a
number
of
problems,
we
think,
with
that
position.
the
first,
of
course,
is
that
it
render
the
statute
largely
superfluous
and
redundant.
after
all,
there
would
have
been
no
reason
to
pass
a
statute
to
prevent
the
states
from
imposing
jurisdiction-based
taxes
on
the
ocs.
this
court
had
held
in
a
series
of
cases
between
1947
and
1950
that
the
ocs
was
an
area
of
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction.
therefore,
the
due
process
clause
and
the
commerce
clause
already
prevented
the
states
from
imposing
any
jurisdiction-based
taxes
on
the
ocs.
so
there
really
wouldn't
have
been
any
reason,
if
that
had
been
congress'
intention,
to
pass
a
separate,
two
separate
statutory
provisions
providing
that
the
states
could
not
impose
jurisdiction
based
taxes
on
the
ocs.
the
second
point
that
iowa
makes
is,
as
i
said
earlier,
a
bit
of
a
linguistic
point.
they
suggest
that
even
if
section
1333(a)(2)
means
what
it
seems
to
say,
which
is
that
state
taxation
laws
shall
not
apply
to
the
outer
continental
shelf,
that
they
are
not
really
"applying"
their
state
taxation
laws
to
the
outer
continental
shelf.
and
for
this,
they
rely,
as
i
said
earlier,
on
a
series
of
decisions
from
this
court
involving
constitutional
or
due
process
objections.
now
it's
true
that
this
court
has
said
in
a
number
of
cases
that
apportioned
taxation
generally
doesn't
violate
the
due
process
clause,
because
it's
really
meant
only
to
measure
in-state
taxation.
there's
no
sort
of
extraterritorial
taxation
going
on.
and
we
don't
challenge
iowa's
right
to
tax
ocs
revenues
under
the
constitution.
we
think
congress
meant
something
more
than
that
when
it
passed
the
statute.
we
think
that
congress
didn't
have
to
be
satisfied
with
the
"rough
approximations"
that
occur
under
the
due
process
laws
when
apportioned
state
income
taxation
is
attacked
as
violating
rules
against
extraterritorial
taxation.
congress
had
something
more
in
mind.
we
believe
it
could
require,
and
in
our
view
it
plainly
did
require,
more
precision
than
the
constitution
requires.
it
required
that
the
states
not
include
any
ocs
values
in
figuring
out
their
state
income
taxes,
just
as,
for
example,
congress
in
passing
section
3124(a)
of
title
31
prohibited
the
states
from
including
any
income
earned
from
federal
securities
in
the
income
base
subject
to
state
taxation.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
of
course
the
ocs
is
government
public
lands.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
don't
know
of
any
others,
mr.
chief
justice.
now,
as
i
said,
there
is
to
be
this
area
of
federally
protected
income
from
the
states.
iowa
concedes
it
can't
pass
a
severance
tax,
or
a
property
tax,
or
an
excise
tax,
or
an
unapportioned
income
tax,
but
it
claims,
though,
that
it
can
apply
an
apportioned
income
tax
to
ocs
income,
even
though
it
has
the
same
practical
effect
at
making
ocs
operations--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--those
are
lands
within
the
united
states,
and
they're
subject
to
a
whole
different
series
of
statues,
mr.
chief
justice,
such
as
the
mineral
leasing
act.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
congress
followed
a
totally
different
scheme
in
those
federal
area,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
those
are
areas
within
the
states,
and
in
many
cases,
the
states
had
a
legitimate
claim
to
what
went
on
in
those
areas.
some
of
those
areas
had
been
ceded
to
the
federal
government.
congress...
if
one
reads
the
legislative
history
of
the
ocsla,
it's
quite
clear
that
congress
wanted
to
take
a
totally
different
approach
with
the
ocs,
because
it
was
an
area
that
had
never
been
part
of
the
states.
it
was
an
exclusively
federal
enclave.
and
therefore,
what
congress
wanted
to
say
is
that
the
state...
it
is
irrelevant
to
state
tax
laws
what
happens
out
here.
money
is
going
to
be
made
out
here,
we
want
to
immunize
that
from
state
taxation
in
order
to
encourage
development
on
the
shelf,
and
in
order
to
maximize
federal
revenues.
now,
iowa
never
explains
how
its
theory
of
state
taxation
laws
shall
not
apply
to
the
outer
continental
shelf
is
in
any
way
consistent
with
those
purposes.
iowa
concedes
that
if
money
is
made
on
the
shelf,
that
company's
state
tax
income,
state
income
tax
liability
goes
up
and
therefore
makes
ocs
operations
less
profitable.
iowa
concedes
that
it
can't
make
ocs
operations
less
profitable
by
imposing
any
other
sort
of
tax
out
there.
but
it
never
explains
why
it
is
consistent
with
the
policies
of
the
ocsla
to
make
ocs
operations
less
profitable
by
imposing
an
apportioned
income
tax.
it
really
can't
be
seriously
suggested
here
that
iowa
hasn't
required
shell
to
include
its
ocs
income
in
figuring
out
its
iowa
income
tax
liability.
iowa
concedes
that
it
requires
shell
to
include
its
ocs
profits
in
its
iowa
income
base,
and
the
undisputed
figures
that
i
referred
to
earlier
show
that
shell
has
to
pay
more
in
iowa
income
taxes
simply
because
it's
making
a
profit
on
the
shelf.
and
we
think
the
conclusion
is
therefore
inescapable
that
in
any
meaningful
sense
of
the
statutory
terms,
iowa
has
applied
its
income
tax
laws
to
the
ocs.
iowa
doesn't
dispute
that
the
more
income
shell
makes
on
the
ocs,
it
has
to
include
the
income
in
its
iowa
calculations
for
figuring
out
its
iowa
income
tax,
and
as
a
result
it
has
to
pay
more,
ultimately,
in
iowa
income
tax.
it's
inconceivable
that
would
not
be
within
congress'
contemplation
when
it
said
that
state
taxation
laws
shall
not
apply
to
the
outer
continental
shelf.
we
therefore
believe
that
the
court
should
reverse
the
judgement
of
the
iowa
supreme
court,--
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
just
a
few
things,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
i'd
like
to
address
the
statement
that
justice
scalia
made
earlier
about
the
possible
interpretation
of
the
phrase
"state
taxation
laws
shall
not
apply
to
the
outer
continental
shelf.
"
justice
scalia
suggested
that
maybe
that
was
simply
meant
to
exclude
state
tax
laws
from
the
state
laws
that
were
being
adopted
as
federal
law,
as
i
understand
it.
but
i
think
that
that
makes
absolutely
no
sense,
when
you
look
at
the
legislative
debates.
the
whole
purpose
of
the
debates
was
over
whether
the
states
would
be
able
to
share
in
any
ocs
revenues.
that's
crystal
clear,
that
this
was
intended
to
be
a
restriction
on
the
states.
but
if
state
tax
laws
had
been
adopted
as
federal
law,
under
the
first
part
of
section
1333(a)(2),
then
the
revenues
from
those
state
taxes
would
have
gone
to
the
federal
government,
not
to
the
states,
and
those
state
taxes
would
have
been
administered
by
the
federal
government,
not
by
the
states.
so
therefore,
i
think
that
reading
of
the
state
tax
prohibition
would
make
it
a
restriction
on
the
powers
of
the
federal
government,
not
on
the
powers
of
the
states,
which
makes
very
little
sense.
congress
must
have
had
something
more
in
mind
than
not
adopting
state
tax
laws
as
federal
law,
i
believe,
when
it
passed
the
state
tax
prohibition
in
section
1333(a)(2).
now,
i
didn't
hear
anything
in
iowa's
statements
here
today,
or
either
from
the
solicitor
general,
explaining
why
it
would
make
any
sense,
given
the
policies
and
purposes
of
the
act,
to
allow
the
states
to
diminish
ocs
profits
through
this
one
form
of
state
taxation.
they
have
some
arguments
about
there
being
nothing
on
the
face
of
the
statute
about
apportionment
methods.
of
course
there's
nothing
on
the
face
of
the
statute
that
talks
about
property
taxes
or
severance
taxes
either.
as
justice
o'connor
said,
congress
spoke
quite
categorically.
it
said
state
taxation
laws
as
a
group.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
we
have
said...
i
think
i
said
earlier
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
question,
transaction-based
taxes
of
this
sort,
that
are
imposed
well
after
any
profits
are
earned
on
the
ocs,
are
not
within
the
intent
of
congress
in
passing
this
immunity.
we
don't
suggest
the
statute
goes
that
far.
thank
you.
