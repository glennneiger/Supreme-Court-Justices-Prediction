justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
didn't
they
go
further
than
just
saying
the
jury
could
have
found
actual
malice?
i
thought
they
found
that
the
jury
could
have
found
certain
facts,
and
if
the
jury
found
those
facts,
then
there
was
actual
malice.
didn't
they
make
that
judgment
themselves,
that
if
these
facts
existed,
there
was
in
their
own
view
actual
malice?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
how
i
understood
it,
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
then
taking
all
those
facts
and
the
favorable
inferences,
they
made
their
own
judgment,
given
those
facts
and
inferences,
that
there
was
actual
malice
didn't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
in
order
to
work
the
system
that
you're
urging
upon
us,
we
have
to...
and
every
district
judge
would
have
to...
determine
where
fact
leaves
off
and
inference
begins.
that's
crucial
because
you
accept...
you
accept
what
the
jury
might
find
on
fact.
you
give
all
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
to
the
plaintiff
on
fact.
but
on
inference
you
make
your
own
judgment.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
that's
the
crucial
distinction,
the
difference
between
fact
and
inference.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
that's
a
clear
line?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
does
one
go
about
separating
out
the
facts
that
the
jury
has
found
from
the
inferences?
i
mean,
a
particular
proposition
may
be
established
as
a
fact
or
it...
from
a
fact
which
a
jury
rejected...
it
might
have
been
an
inference
from
that
fact.
or,
it
might
have
been
independently
found
as
a
fact
rather
than
as
an
inference
from
another
fact.
how
is...
how
is
the
reviewing
court
to
tell?
i
mean,
you
say
he
has
to
accept
all
the
findings
of
fact
that
the
jury
made.
how
do
you
know
which
findings
of
fact
they
made?
all
you
know
is
a
verdict.
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
mr.
levine,
can
i
come
back
to
your
precise
example
of
what's
a
finding
of
fact?
about
the
meeting
that
occurred
the
next
morning
and
what
occurred
at
that
meeting...
you
said
that
would
have
been
a
finding
of
fact.
what
about
other
statements
that
thompson
made
that
are
not
contradicted?
there...
there
is
no
evidence
contradicting
them.
but
the
jury,
knowing
that
thompson
lied
about
this
other
one...
about
whether
the
meeting
occurred...
and
about
another
number
of
other
things
on
which
there
was
conflicting
testimony,
the
jury
says,
"we
don't
believe
thompson
at
all,
and
we
reject
everything
that
thompson
said.
"
now,
how
does
the
court
of
appeals
handle
that?
is
that
a...
is
that
an
inference
from
the
other
findings
of
facts?
since
she
lied
five
times,
we
assume
she
lied
seven
times.
i
suppose
that's
an
inference.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
no,
but
it
didn't.
there
is
no
contradictory
evidence.
i
cannot...
i
cannot,
as
an
appellate
judge,
look
at
the
fact
that
she
was
contradicted
five
times
in
what
she
said.
she
said
two
other
things
that
weren't
contradicted,
but
i
can't
assume,
well,
you
know,
the
jury
thought
she
was
lying
five
times,
they
must
have
though
that
she
couldn't
be
relied
on
at
all
and
therefore
they
didn't
believe
her
the
other
two.
i
can't
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
levine,
why...
why
is
it
so
insubstantial
a
protection
to
accept
jury
facts
and
inferences
and
then
apply
that
new
york
times
rule?
for
example,
on
the
malice
issue,
if
i
applied
that
rule
to
the
facts
and
inferences
here,
i
wouldn't
find
malice
just...
just
from
the
fact
that
this
was
a
competing
newspaper
and
it
favored
the
other
political
candidate.
i
wouldn't
say
that
the
facts
and
inferences
that
are
derivable
from
this
record
would
show,
in
my
judgment,
clearly
and
convincingly
that
this
newspaper
really
went
out
to
tell
a
lie.
on
the
other
question,
that
is,
whether
they
were
careless
enough
to
be
reckless
about
whether
it
was
true
or
false,
that's
a
much
closer
question.
but
don't
you
exaggerate
it
by
saying
that
it's
no
protection
whatever?
especially
since
the
new
york
times
standard
is
clear
and
convincing
evidence
of
malice?
even
if
you
took
all
the
facts
and
all
the
inferences
from
the
jury
here,
would
you
acknowledge
that
there
was
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
your
client,
in
order
to
gain
a
competitive
advantage
over
another
newspaper,
in
order
to
hurt
a
political
candidate
they
didn't
like,
intentionally
lied?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
so,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
talking
to
ms.
stephens?
that's...
that's
what
i
really
can't
understand?
why
not
talk
to
the
sister
before
you
go
to
the
story?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
have
been
a
non-story
if
you
had,
not
a
better
story,
because
she
contradicted
everything
her
sister
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
that...
that
isn't
a
denial
that
there
was
an
offer
by--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
not?
yes.
it's
a
denial
that
she
did.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
did...
what
do
we
do
with
that
testimony?
is
that
a
fact
or
an
inference?
do
i...
do
i
take
to
be
a
denial
that
it
occurred
or
not
a
denial
that
it
occurred?
is
that
something
i
give
the
jury
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
on
or
do
i
decided
that
for
myself?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
do
that?
can
you
put
forward
charges
that
you
know
are
irresponsible?
that
you...
suppose...
suppose
they
knew
the
charges
were
false,
that
wouldn't
be
a
defense,
would
it,
that
you
put
forward
the
false
charges
and
you
also
put
forward
his
denial?
you
can't
do
that,
can
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
that's
no
good.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
what
if
you
have
reason
to
suspect
very
gravely
that
it's
false
but
you
don't
bother
to
check
up.
does
the
situation
change?
you
can
say,
well,
you
know,
i
really
think
it's
a
pack
of
lies
but
i
don't
know
for
sure
and
i'm
not
going
to
check.
can
you
do
that
so
long
as
you
put
in
the
other
side?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you're--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
sure
it's
false
but
you
suspect
it's
false.
but
you
say,
i'm
not
going
to
check
any
further.
