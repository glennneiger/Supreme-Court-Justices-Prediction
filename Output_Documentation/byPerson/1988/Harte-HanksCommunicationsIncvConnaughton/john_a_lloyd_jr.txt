mr.
john
a.
lloyd,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
speak
first
to
the
issue
of
whether
it
was
proper
for
any
court,
the
jury,
the
trial
court,
or
this
court,
to
consider
whether
the
motive
of
a
newspaper
is
one
of
the
kinds
of
circumstantial
evidence
that
bear
upon
the
question
of
actual
malice.
that's
all
we've
said.
and
this
court
indicated
that
in
butts
and
the
panel
majority
in
tavoulareas
also
reemphasized
it.
all
we
say
about
the
motive
to
compete
against
the
enquirer
and
to
protect
the
incumbent
judge,
that
it
is
a
kind
of
circumstantial
evidence
which,
combined
with
all
the
circumstantial
evidence
in
the
record
and
the
direct
evidence
of
actual
malice,
adds
up
to...
enough
to
constitute
clear
and...
excuse
me...
clear
and
convincing
evidence
of
actual
malice.
now,
let
me
next
talk
about
that
line
of
cases
that
my
colleague
believes
justifies
a
kind
of
independent
review
that
he
would
have
appellate
courts
engage
in
in
public
figure
libel
cases.
the
cases,
beginning
with
fiske--
mr.
john
a.
lloyd,
jr.
--including
the
trial
judge.
the
line
of
cases,
beginning
with
fiske,
involving
whether
there
was
a
clear
and
present
danger,
whether
material
appeals
of
prurient
interest.
i'll
give
you
another...
whether
the
evidence
shows
there
is
jury
segregation.
all
of
those
cases
involve
objective
questions.
whereas
in
here,
in
this
case,
the
question
is...
the
question
is
what
was
in
the
mind
of
the
publisher
of
the
matter
when
he
decided
to
put
it
in
circulation.
a
purely
subjective
question.
beyond
that,
those
questions,
those
cases
that
he
would
invoke
in
support
of
his
position,
involve
only
the
ultimate
question,
not...
in
none
of
those
cases
did
the
court
say
that
exhaustive
independent
review
by
appellate
courts
of
the
record
was
justified.
and
so
that
we're
dealing
with
different
kind
of
animals.
indeed,
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
bose
under
which
we
made
reference
in
the
brief,
noted
the
vast
distinction
between
that
line
of
cases
and
this
kind
of
case
where
the
subjective
question
is
much
more
difficult
to
answer
than
an
objective
question
where
a
clear
and
present
danger
exists.
now,
i
think
the
record
in
this
case--
mr.
john
a.
lloyd,
jr.
--disposes
of--
mr.
john
a.
lloyd,
jr.
--yes,
justice
stephens.
mr.
john
a.
lloyd,
jr.
well,
there
always
is
in
this
sense,
and
as
justice
white
taught
us
in
st.
amant,
where
someone
claims
that
he
acted
in
good
faith
and
didn't
know
that
something
was
true
and
published
a
harmful
article,
his
professions
of
good
faith
are
not
likely
to
be
very
persuasive
where
their
statement
is
so
inherently
improbable
that
only
a
reckless
man
would
put
it
in
circulation.
so
that
there
is
a
relationship
between
an
objective
standard,
which
is
applicable
if
the
record
permits
it,
and
the
kind
of
subjective
determination
which
the
jury
had
to
make
in
order
to
make
a
finding
of
actual
malice
under...
under
the
court.
now,
the
test
that
this
court
has
laid
down...
it
is
stated
various
ways,
but
always
comes
out...
one
way
it's
stated
is
subjective
belief
in
probable
falsity.
it
is
what
the
state
of
mind
of
a
publisher
is.
that's
why...
that's
why
the
attack--
mr.
john
a.
lloyd,
jr.
--which
the
petitioner's
make
upon
this
record
is
so
inherently
flawed.
they
would...
they're
asking...
they're
asking
the
appellate
court
to
do
something
which--
mr.
john
a.
lloyd,
jr.
--i
view
it
as
in
the
alternative.
i
think
on
this
set
of
facts
anyone
who
was
at
that
trial
would
have
believed
that
jim
blount
and
pam
long
and
those
people
who
decided
to
publish
this
article
knew
it
was
false.
only
a
reckless
could
have...
could
have
believed
otherwise.
and
i'll
tell
you
why.
the
argument
has
been
made
here
that,
after
all,
negligence
is
not
enough
to
allow
a
public
figure
to
prevail
under
the
new
york
times.
and
i
don't...
i
don't
dispute
that.
what
we're
talking
about
is
the
kind
of
evidence
we
adduced
at
this
trial,
that
after
being
told
by
all
six
people
who
were
interviewed
at
this
late
night
conference,
that
no,
dan
connaughton
didn't
make
any
such
statements.
and
after...
after
having
known
that
alice
thompson
was
a
lady
with
a
psychiatric
history,
a
criminal
record,
a
motive
to
lie,
and
other...
and
other
basis
to
believe
she
was
undesirable,
the
decisionmakers
consciously
avoided
talking
to
patsy
stephens,
who
could
have
corroborated
what
this
lady
said,
the
consciously
avoided
listening
to
the
tapes
of
that
meeting
that
was
held
at
connaughton's
house
which
brought
along,
asked
for...
which
connaughton
said,
"here
they
are.
"
"listen
to
the
tapes.
"
"make
up
your
mind.
"
that
is
not
negligence.
that
is
perverse,
premeditated
ignorance.
i'm
going
to
stick
my
head
in
the
sand
so
nobody
can
prove
i
knew
it
because
if
i
ask
one
more
question,
i'm
going
to
find
out
something
that's
going
to
keep
me
from
running
the
article
i'm
determined
to
run
in
order
to
ruin
dan
connaughton.
that's
not
negligence,
if
this
court
please.
that's
what
distinguishes
this
from
new
york
times
and
from
st.
amant,
because
by
any
test
or
under
any
standard
i
would
have
brought
this
case...
and
i
believe
that
a
properly
instructed
jury
hearing
this
evidence
would
have
found
that
actual
malice
was
proved
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
then
we
have
all
these
admissions.
the
author
of
the
article,
pam
long
said,
"i
made
no
decision
as
to
whether
what
she
said
was
true
when
i
ran
the
article.
"
jim
blount
said,
"we
didn't
determine
whether
what
she
said
was
true.
"
and
then...
and
then
the
newspaper's
lawyer
said
it
at
the
pre-publication
conference,
he
was
told
it
was
all
a
matter
of
misinterpretation.
that's
not
negligence.
that
is
the
most
egregious
kind
of--
mr.
john
a.
lloyd,
jr.
--i'm
defending
the
judgment
below
in
topra
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
i
was
not
oblivious
to
what
i
thought
the
requirements
of
bose
were
when
this
case
went
to
the
court
of
appeals,
was
briefed
and
argued.
and
i
was...
i
was
overwhelmed
at
the
exhaustive
treatment...
scrutiny
of
that
record
which
the
sixth
circuit
gave
it.
and
it
seemed
to
me
that...
that
the
sixth
circuit
went
beyond
what
this
court
requires
in
bose.
it
certainly
was
entirely
faithful--
mr.
john
a.
lloyd,
jr.
--i
think
it
defined
the
actual
malice
as
reckless...
knowledge
of
probable
falsity
or
reckless
disregard
for
the
truth.
the
sixth
circuit
has
been
attacked
on
the
ground
that
it
used
a
prurience...
its
prurience
standard
that
the
plurality
in
curtis
publishing
laid
down.
that
is
nonsense.
but
i
don't--
mr.
john
a.
lloyd,
jr.
--but
that
is
said...
that
demonstrates
reckless
disregard
for
the
truth.
in
other
words,
a
massive
quantum
of
circumstantial
evidence...
and,
by
the
way,
all
circumstantial
evidence
is
evidence
on
which
inferences
are
drawn.
as
an
old
time
trial
lawyer,
i
have
as
much
trouble
as
justice
scalia
does
deciding
the
difference
between
a
fact
and
an
inference.
but
this
massive
record
of
circumstantial
evidence
of
i
want
to
put
my
head
in
the
sand
because
i
don't
want
to
know
why
i
can't
run
this
article,
certainly
adds
up.
that
is...
is
an
extreme
departure
from
journalistic
practice.
no
question.
and
it
does
demonstrate
actual
malice.
i
would
think...
i
would
not
be
afraid
to
ask
this
court
to
say...
to
affirm
this
judgment
if
the
standard
were
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
as
justice
scalia
said,
that
he
thought
it
might
well
be
in
fact
in
liberty
lobby.
there
has
never
been
in
any
case,
including
saturday
evening
post
or
curtis...
curtis
publishing,
rather,
v.
butts,
as
massive
a
record
of
knowledge
of
falsity
and
then
reckless
disregard
for
the
truth
as
we
showed,
as
we
presented,
as
the
court
of
appeals
looked
at,
and
as
is
before
this
court.
and
i've
never
argued
here
before,
but
i
never
thought
i'd
be
here
arguing
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
this
is
unique
to
a
public
figure
libel
case,
and
i'm
not
complaining
about
it.
my
colleague
has
said
a
lot
of
things
that
i
frankly
don't
understand.
i
think
i
understand
bose.
i
agree
with
chief
justice
about
bose.
but
that
doesn't
matter.
i
could
win
this
case
under
new
york
times
alone.
that's...
or
st.
amant
or...
all
the
case
law
combined
distill
it
out
that
dan
connaughton
make
the
requisite
showing
necessary
to
get
a
verdict
to
sustain...
said
he
made
admissions
and
confessions.
that's
absolute
nonsense.
dan
connaughton
was
brought
into
a
meeting
where
he
was
told
the
endorsement
of
the
newspaper
might
be
on
the
line.
and
he
was
asked,
first
of
all,
"did
you
say
this?
"
"did
you
say
that?
"
"did
you
say
you
were
going
to
blackmail
a
judge?
"
no.
absolutely
not.
the
denials
were
flat,
unequivocable,
absolute.
then
he
was
asked
to
speculate
as
why
this
lady
may
have
said
these
things.
now,
a
more
seasoned
politician
would
have
said,
"no,
i'm
not
going
to
play
that
game.
"
he
didn't.
in
good
faith
he
tried
to
figure
out
why
she
might
have
said
it.
and
that's
all
there
was
to
it.
but
in
no
case
can
what
this
man
said
be
equated
to
admissions
of
anything.
and
i
frankly
submit
respectfully
that
judge
guy
got
disoriented
when
he
wrote
the
dissenting
opinion
and
based
it
on
those
statements
and
said...
and
said
that
they
were
admissions.
they
weren't
admissions
of
anything.
asked
the
man
to
speculate
and
the
man
speculated.
and
that's
all
there
is
to
that.
so,
coming
down
finally,
the
esoteric
considerations
are
interesting,
and
i
will
say
frankly
i
quite
got
lost
in
some
of
the
colloquy
between
the
court
and
my
colleague
on
some
of
these
abstractions.
i'm
an
old
fashioned
trial
lawyer.
i
know
what
evidence
is.
i
know
what
interests
is.
i
know
what
you
argue
to
a
jury.
i
tried
this
case.
a
motion
was
made
rather
timidly
for
a
directed
verdict
but
judge
rubin
said--
mr.
john
a.
lloyd,
jr.
--well,
i'm
not
going
to
listen
to
that;
i
will
overrule
it.
mr.
john
a.
lloyd,
jr.
well,
justice
stephens
i
can't
tell
you
why
judge
guy
didn't
agree
with
judge
krupansky
and
judge
keith.
all
i
can
tell
you
is
that
i
think
krupansky
saw
judge
guy's
characterization
as
a
mischaracterization
and...
and
he
identified
it
as
just
a
way
of
locking
at
evidence
in
the
wrong
way.
my
answer
to
you,
i
guess,
is
that...
that
version
of
the
evidence,
that
contention
that
my
client
admitted
all
of
this
was
argued
to
the
jury,
and
they
didn't
buy
it.
they
didn't
believe
that
that's
what
happened
based
upon
their--
mr.
john
a.
lloyd,
jr.
--review
of
the
all
the
evidence.
mr.
john
a.
lloyd,
jr.
well,
and
judge
guy
thought
they
did.
mr.
john
a.
lloyd,
jr.
and
the
majority
thought
they
didn't.
and
i
think
that
the
majority
was
right
and
the...
to
say
the
judge
was
wrong,
respectfully.
mr.
john
a.
lloyd,
jr.
you
see,
what...
where
judge
guy
missed
the
point.
and
i
admire
him
and
i
like
him,
but
i
must
say
respectfully
he
missed
the
point,
and
i
told
him
this
privately.
he...
he
didn't
understand
that
the
gravamen
of
the
charge
were
published.
the
statements
made
by
the
thompson
woman
were
that
dan
connaughton
got
these
two
women
at
his
home,
he
had
his
tape
recorders,
and
he
turned
them
off
and
he
made
a
lot
of
promises
and
offers
to
induce
them
to
testify.
he
turned
the
tape
back
on
and
he
got
their
statements.
now,
that
all
this
was
done
as
an
inducement
to
get
testimony.
then
he
said,
i'm
going
to
blackmail
a
judge,
and
then
he
got
mad,
when
that
didn't
work...
and
made
these
charges.
now,
that's
an
enormously--
mr.
john
a.
lloyd,
jr.
--hurtful
thing
to
say.
now,
his
admissions,
if
your
honor
please,
did
not
go
to
any
of
those
things.
all
he
said
was
that,
one
time
when
i
came
to
the
house
my
wife
was
talking
to
these
ladies
about
something
and
somebody
may
have
interpreted
something.
as
to
whether--
mr.
john
a.
lloyd,
jr.
--that
i
don't
know.
mr.
john
a.
lloyd,
jr.
well,
but
you
see,
my
client
said
to
the
journal
news
people
at
that
interview,
"see
for
yourself.
"
"play
the
tapes.
"
"you'll
hear.
"
and
the
head-in-the-sand
took
over.
they
didn't
want
to
play
the
tapes.
now,
the
jury
heard
the
tapes
and
they
heard
dan
connaughton's
voice
on
the
tapes.
they
also
heard
all
the
people
who
were
at
that
meeting,
including
a
lady
who
herself
worked
for
the
journal
news
and
her
husband,
the
deputy
fire
chief,
say,
we
were
there
the
whole
time
and
the
man
never
said
anything
like
that.
at
that
point
i
think,
in
my
humble
opinion,
when
the
journal
news
received
that
report
from
those
people,
that
should
have
been
the
end
of
the
inquiry.
a
responsible
newspaper
would
have
said,
okay,
call
this
one
off.
and
i
think...
far
beyond
that...
that's
when
he
got
into
reckless
regard
and
that's
why
the
jury
brought
in
a
verdict
for
the
plaintiff,
and
it
was
upheld
by
the
sixth
circuit.
now,
i've
said
a
lot
of
things
in
my
brief.
aside
from
affirming
the
judgment,
the
petitioner
really
asks
you
enact
a
rule
of
absolute
immunity
for...
for
the
press
against...
against
litigation
by
public
figures.
and
if
you
reverse
this
judgment,
i
think
the
signal
that
goes
out
will
be,
look,
public
figures
can't
win
libel
cases;
give
up;
there's
no
way
to
win.
the
rule
exists,
but
it
exists
as
honored
in
a
breach
25
years
after
new
york
times
was
announced.
i
urge
this
court
to
give
it
some
vitality,
make
it
mean
something.
here
is
a
plaintiff
that
won
a
case
against...
if
i
may
use
the
term
from
desegregation
litigation...
against
a
loaded
game
board.
he
climbed
over
all
these
obstacles
and
prevailed
because
his
evidence
was
massive
and
his
cause
was
just.
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
that's
all
any
court
of
appeals
could
ever
be
asked
to
do,
is
what
the
sixth
circuit
has
done
in
this
case.
it
has
been
my
very
great
pleasure
to
argue
to
this
court.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
john
a.
lloyd,
jr.
okay.
