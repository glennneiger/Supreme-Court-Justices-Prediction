justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
does
that
mean?
does
it
mean
that
you...
if
it
rests
on
credibility,
there
is
no
review
by
the
appellate
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you
think,
then,
the
district
judge
in
trying
the
case
should...
should
independently
review
the
evidence
rather
than
let
the
appellate
court
have
that
duty?
justice
byron
r.
white
should
not...
should
not,
in
a
case
like
this,
draw
the
inferences
in
favoring
the
plaintiff?
justice
byron
r.
white
which...
which...
but
that
means...
but
that
means
making
its...
drawing
its
own
inferences
from
the
historical
facts.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the
jury
might...
even
though
there
might
be
arguments
about
what
the
right
inferences
are?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you
then
think
that
essentially
in
this
kind
of
a
case,
malice
or
not,
it
can
never
be
a
question
of
fact.
it
should
be
treated
as
a
question
of
law
and
never
presented
to
the
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
i
know.
but
i
would
just
want
to
maybe
have
a...
just
present
to
the
jury
a
set
of
instructions
as
to
why
we're
having
to
just
deal
with
historical
facts.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
don't
you
[inaudible]
that
judge
then
[inaudible].
justice
byron
r.
white
well
okay.
then
so
the
constitution
requires
that
a
jury
give
an
independent
review
of
a
judge's
decision.
we'll
resume
at
1:00.
you
may
proceed,
mr.
levine.
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
the
seventh
amendment
has
no
bearing
on
the
issues?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
libel
cases
seventh
amendment
is
put
aside?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
including
the
trial
judge?
justice
byron
r.
white
--you're
defending
the
judgment
below
in
topra,
i
guess.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
standard
that
[inaudible]...
how
about
its
definition
of
malice?
how
do
you
think
it
defined
the
actual
malice?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
saying
those
words
and
[inaudible]
used
reckless
disregard.
