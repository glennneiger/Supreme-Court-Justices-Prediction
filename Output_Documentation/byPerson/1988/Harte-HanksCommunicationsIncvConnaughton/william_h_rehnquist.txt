chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
88-10,
harte-hanks
communications
v.
connaughton.
mr.
levine,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
sixth
circuit
here
say
there
was
actual
malice?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
disagree
with
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
basis
for
any
sort
of
line
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
what's
the
difference...
under
your
test,
the
difference
between
an
inference
and
a
factual
deduction?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then,
what's
the
use
of
your
test?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
talking
about
two
constitutional
provisions.
one
is
the
first
amendment
and
the
other
is
the
seventh
amendment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
new
york
times
wouldn't
have
involved
the
seventh
amendment,
would
it?
because
i
thought
that
came
from
a
state
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well...
just
a
minute.
i
thought
you
said
just
a
moment
ago
that
in
two
cases,
this
court
had
confronted
a
conflict
between
the
seventh
amendment
and
the
first
amendment,
one
of
those
cases
being
new
york
times
and
the
other
being
bose.
and
in
both
cases
they'd
ruled
in
favor
of
the
first
amendment.
was
that
your
statement?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
was
that...
was
that
true?
did
that
come...
did
new
york
times
come
from
a
federal
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
how
could
the
seventh
amendment
been
involved?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
we've
held
the
seventh
amendment
does
apply
to
state
courts
in
some
situations?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
levine.
mr.
lloyd.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lloyd.
mr.
levine,
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
levine.
the
case
is
submitted.
