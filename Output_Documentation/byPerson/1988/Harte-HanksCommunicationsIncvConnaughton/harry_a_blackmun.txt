mr.
levine,
you
place
a
great
deal
of
confidence
in
the
bose
case,
don't
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
must
confess
i'm
a
little
puzzled
as
to
why
you
need
it,
from
your
point
of
view.
and
maybe
you
do.
do
you
concede
that
the
article
was
false?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
was?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
suppose
the
bose
case
were
not
on
the
books,
not
decided,
what
would
you
be
arguing?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
guess
what
i'm
saying
is
i
think
you
have
stronger
case
without
bose
and
you
don't
have
to
rely
on
bose.
but,
go
ahead,
do
it
your
own
way.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
then
where
is
the
falsity?
