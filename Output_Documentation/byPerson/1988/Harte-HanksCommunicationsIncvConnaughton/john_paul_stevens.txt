mr.
lloyd--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
you
just
one
question--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--on
this
subjective
point.
you're
clearly...
i
think
you're
clearly
correct
when
you're
asking
whether
there
was
actual
knowledge
of
falsity.
that
would
be
purely
a
subjective
inquiry.
but
if
you're
asking
whether...
given
what
the
record
shows
the
newspaper
knew
at
the
time,
whether
that
constitutes
reckless
disregard,
that's
certain...
it's
arguably
an
objective
inquiry,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--do
you
view
the
jury
verdict
here
as
having
found
that
the
newspaper
actually
knew
the
story
was
false
or
that
it
acted
in
reckless
disregard
and
didn't--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lloyd,
could
i
interrupt
you
for
just
a
moment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
you
deal
with
the
fact
that
the
dissenting
opinion
below
discussed
the
interview
with
your
client
at
great
length
and
the
majority
virtually
ignored
it?
and,
really,
on
almost
each
point
that
tends
to
look
unfavorably
toward
your
client
there
is
at
least
some
factual
basis
on
each
of
those
isolated
points.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
issue--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
issue
isn't
whether
it
happened,
but
whether
those
statements
made
by
your
client
and
transcribed
provided
the
newspaper
with
a
sufficient
basis
for...
for
running
the
story.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
some...
the
promise
of
the
florida
trip,
and
he
admits
they
talked
about
going
down
to
hilton
head
or
florida,
and
the
promise
of
a
job.
and
admits
that
it
was
a
deli
shop
or
a
gourmet
or
an
ice
cream
shop.
i
mean,
you're
right
if
you
got
the
verdict
before
the
jury,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
but
he--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
but
isn't
it...
it
is
true,
is
it
note,
that
the
interview
lasted
much
longer
than
the
tape?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
impression
i
got
that...
and
that
the
stuff
that
was
in
dispute
is
what
happened
on
the
tape...
was
not
turned
on.
