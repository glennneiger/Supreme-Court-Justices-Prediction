mr.
lee
levine
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
twenty-five
years
ago
this
month
in
new
york
times
v.
sullivan
this
court
articulated
the
central
meaning
of
the
first
amendment.
it
held
that
if
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
the
press
mean
anything
in
a
democracy,
it
is
that
criticism
of
public
officials
and
candidates
for
public
office
must
be
free.
in
this
case,
a
$200,000
judgment
has
been
entered
against
a
newspaper
because
it
published
statements
critical
of
a
candidate
for
public
office
in
the
midst
of
a
hotly-contested
election
campaign.
we
submit
that
this
judgment,
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
affirming
a
jury's
finding
that
this
speech
is
unworthy
of
constitutional
protection
can
be
affirmed
only
ignoring
the
three
fundamental
safeguards
of
political
speech
articulated
in
new
york
times.
first,
that
only
expression
published
with
actual
malice...
that
is,
despite
a
high
degree
of
awareness
of
its
probable
falsity...
is
beyond
the
scope
of
constitutional
protection.
mr.
lee
levine
it
held
that
a
jury
could
have
found
actual
malice.
mr.
lee
levine
we
disagree
with
both
the
contention
that
its
standard
of
review
was
limited
to
what
the
jury
could
have
found
and
with
the
conclusion
that
the
evidence
revealed...
that
the
evidence
in
the
record
reveals
actual
malice.
the
second
requirement
of
new
york
times
is
the
proof--
mr.
lee
levine
--justice
scalia,
they
added--
mr.
lee
levine
--justice
scalia,
they
added
another
step
in
there.
after
they
found
the
facts,
they
drew
all
conceivable
inferences--
mr.
lee
levine
--from
those
facts--
mr.
lee
levine
--in
favor
of
the
jury's
verdict.
mr.
lee
levine
that
is
correct.
and
that
is...
that
is
in
fact
the
guts
of
this
case,
the
third
point,
the
third
safeguard
of
free
expression
identified
in
new
york
times.
that
is
the
obligation
of
appellate
courts
to
undertake
a
review
of
the
entire
record,
not
simply
the
evidence
favoring
the
defendant...
or,
the
plaintiff,
and
make
an
independent
judgment,
drawing
its
own
inferences
from
the
record
evidence.
mr.
lee
levine
justice--
mr.
lee
levine
--justice
o'connor,
as
this
court
held
in
bose,
the
standard
of
independent
review
requires
that
courts
give
due
regard
to
the
ability
of
factfinders,
be
they
juries
or
trial
judges,
to
observe
demeanor
and
make
credibility
assessments.
in
this
case
specifically--
mr.
lee
levine
--with
respect
to
purely--
mr.
lee
levine
--with
respect
to
purely
factual
findings,
justice
white.
if
there
is
disputed
evidence
in
the
record
on
an
issue
of
material
fact,
we
would
say
that
in
the
typical
case
you
are
required
to
defer
to
the
jury's
credibility
findings.
let
me
summarize--
mr.
lee
levine
--your
honor,
i
am
unfamiliar
with
the
record
as
it
stood
at
the
time
that...
you're
talking
about...
at
a
directed
verdict
stage?
mr.
lee
levine
i
do
not
think
the
judge
should
have
let
this
go
to
the
jury.
i
think--
mr.
lee
levine
--i
think
that's
right.
i
think
a
directed
verdict
should
have
been
granted
in
this
case.
the
material
facts
can
be
summarized
as
follows.
the
respondent
daniel
connaughton
was
a
candidate
for
the
elected
office
of
municipal
court
judge
in
the
november
1983
elections
in--
mr.
lee
levine
--if
at
the
directed
verdict
stage,
as
justice
kennedy
was
pointing
out,
the
district
court
looks
at
the
evidence
and
decides
that--
mr.
lee
levine
--it
should
resolved
disputed
issues
of
material
fact
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff.
but
taking
those...
those
purely
factual
findings,
it
should
make
its
own
independent
determination
concerning
whether
or
not
there
is
actual
malice.
mr.
lee
levine
from
the
historical
facts.
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
lee
levine
that's
correct
because,
as
this
court
recognized
in
the
bose
decision
and
in
new
york
times
before
it,
in
some
cases
where
the
very
drawing
of
those
inferences
lead
to
make
up
the
process
of
judgment
through
which
the
ultimate
finding
is
made,
you
can't
defer
it
to
the
findings
and
inferences
that
the
jury
could
have
drawn.
you
have
to
draw
your
own
or
else
you're
eliminating
the
process
of
judgment
entirely.
mr.
lee
levine
that's
correct.
mr.
lee
levine
that's
where
i
would
draw
the
line,
your
honor.
i--
mr.
lee
levine
--i
do
not
think
it's
a
clear
line
in--
mr.
lee
levine
--all
cases
and
it's--
mr.
lee
levine
--because
at
some
point
in
the
process,
from
the
ultimate
conclusion
of
actual
malice
at
the
one
end,
to
the
pure
historical
facts...
did
a
meeting
take
place
at
a
certain
date...
at
the
other
end,
somewhere
along
that
line
robbing
an
appellate
court
or
a
reviewing
court
of
the
ability
to
draw
its
own
inferences
necessarily
predetermines
the
result.
mr.
lee
levine
i
think
that
it's
hard
because
you're
dealing
with
labels.
and
what
i
might
call
a
factual
deduction
someone
else
might
call
an
inference.
mr.
lee
levine
because
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
basic
case,
and
virtually
all
cases,
where
a
historical
fact...
a
what-happened
kind
of
fact...
is
susceptible
to
an
inference
that
is
reasonable
and
apparent,
the
reviewing
court,
whether
it...
whether
the
mental
process
it
goes
through
is,
"i'am
exercising
my
own
judgment"
or
"i'm
deferring
to
the
jury's
finding.
"
is
in
99
percent
of
the
cases
going
to
come
up
with
the
exact
same
decision.
but
if
you...
if
you
start
going
down
the
line
where
you
defer
to
the
jury
findings
or
what
the
jury
could
have
found
on
inferences,
you're
going
to
eliminate
the
process
of
judgment.
mr.
lee
levine
no,
i
don't
believe
that's
right,
your
honor,
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
factual
issues
do
go
into
the
determination
of
the
actual
malice
question.
mr.
lee
levine
it
may
in
fact
be
cleaner
and
easier
to
do
it
that
way.
mr.
lee
levine
but
there
is...
there
is
another
issue.
and
that
is
in
many
cases
the
jury
will
serve
as
a
safeguard
for
free
expression.
we
don't
want
to
give
unfettered
authority
to
either
the
jury
or
the
judge
to
decide
that
expression
maybe
penalized.
mr.
lee
levine
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
central
difficulty
with
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
this
case
is
that
it
eviscerates
both
the
clear
and
convincing
evidence
standard
and
the
rule
of
independent
review
set
forth
in
new
york
times.
it
does
so
by
requiring
reviewing
courts
to
defer
to
all
conceivable
inferences
supporting
the
jury's
verdict.
under
the
court
of
appeals
analysis,
a
reviewing
court
is
required
to
do
that
even
it
other
inferences,
in
its
own
view,
are
more
reasonable
or
more
justified.
the
court
of
appeals
has,
therefore,
erected
a
presumption
of
actual
malice
in
every
case.
it
has
mandated
to
finding
the
cumulated
inferences
that
a
reviewing
court
is
required
to
find
will
add
up
to
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
and
it
has
rendered
the
constitutional
obligation
of
independent
review
a
mirage.
independent
review
is
not
independent
if
a
reviewing
court
is
required
to
defer
to
all
findings
of
fact
a
jury
could
have
made
and
then
draw
all
conceivable
inferences
from
those
findings
in
favor
of
the
jury's
verdict.
independent
review
does
not
encompass
the
entire
record
if,
as
the
court
of
appeals
held,
a
reviewing
court
is
required
to
ignore
all
evidence
favoring
the
defendant,
even
undisputed
evidence.
an
independent
review
is
not
review
at
all,
not
in
any
meaningful
sense,
if
a
reviewing
court
is
required
to
defer
to
an
array
of
hypothetical
subsidiary
facts
that
a
jury
could
have
found.
so
viewed,
the
very
process
of
judgment
the
rule
of
independent
review
presupposes
disappears.
in
fact,
it
predetermines
the
result
and
it
eliminates
the
process
of
judgment
entirely.
mr.
lee
levine
i'm
coming
to
the
view,
justice
scalia,
that
our
language
doesn't
give
us
the
proper
labels
to
put
on
these
things
so
that
we
can
know
which
is
which.
and,
as
the
court
has
pointed
out
on
several
occasions,
i
think
we
sometime
put
the
label
on
after
the
fact
to
decide...
to
justify
the
result
that
we've
arrived
at.
but
i
think
that
in
this
case
what
we're
talking
about
in
the
words
of
the
bose
decision
are
the
purely
factual
findings.
the
testimony
in
the
record,
what
the
documents
say.
if
there
is
a
dispute
about
those
facts,
did
a
meeting
take
place?
as
in
this
case,
for
instance.
there
is
testimony
from
the
mother
of
the
young
woman
who
was
the
source
of
the
article
at
issue,
saying
that
the
morning
after
this
all-night
interview
she
came
home
with
her
sister
and
she
and
her
sister
talked
about
how
they
had
been
promised
jobs
and
trips
and
vacations.
the
other
sister,
patsy
stephens,
got
on
the
stand
at
the
trial
and
denied
that
that
ever
happened.
what
i'm
submitting
is
that
that's
the
kind
of
fact,
where
there
is
disputed
testimony
on
both
sides,
where
the
reviewing
court
is
required
to
in
most
cases
assume
that
the
jury
found
that
those
statements
were
never
made
to
the
mother.
mr.
lee
levine
i
think
it's
not
so
much
the
seventh
amendment,
your
honor,
as
it
is
the
fact
that
the
jury
has
the
ability
in
this
case
to
observe
the
witnesses,
to
observe
their
demeanor.
mr.
lee
levine
in
this
case
i
think
it
does
not.
in
the
typical
civil
case,
yes,
it
does.
but
here
where
you're
talking
about
essentially
an
issue
of
constitutional
law--
mr.
lee
levine
--only
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
actual
malice,
your
honor.
mr.
lee
levine
your
honor,
this
court
has
twice
expressly
been
presented
with
that
argument,
both
in
new
york
times
and
in
bose,
and
has
twice
expressly
rejected
it.
and
i
think
that
that's
quite
right.
first
of
all,
you
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
we're
only
talking
about
facts
found
by
a
jury
that
are
relevant
to
the
actual
malice
inquiry.
not
to
the
array
of
other
facts
that
are
relevant
in
libel
cases.
was
it
defamatory?
was
it
published?
was
it
capable
of
a
defamatory
meaning?
were
there
damages?
we're
not
suggesting
at
all
the
the
seventh
amendment
doesn't
apply
to
those
issues.
mr.
lee
levine
this
court
has
never
reached
that
issue,
justice
white,
and
it's
a
tough
issue.
there
is
an
argument
to
be
made
and
one
that
i
would
support,
that
the
issues
of
truth
and
falsity
and
actual
malice
are
so
intertwined
that
you
can't
decide
one
without
the
other.
but
that
issue
has
never
been
here
before.
the
issue
of
actual
malice,
which
is
the
issue
in
this
case,
has
been
here
before
twice,
and
the
court
has
held
that
the
seventh
amendment
does
not
bar
a
reviewing
court
from
undertaking
independent
review.
mr.
lee
levine
your
honor,
the
decisions
of
this
court
are
clear
that--
mr.
lee
levine
--yes,
sir.
mr.
lee
levine
your
honor,
it
came
from
a
state
court.
mr.
lee
levine
there
is
a
case
in
this
court's
jurisprudence
called
chicago
b&o
railroad
v.
chicago...
city
of
chicago...
in
which
this
court
expressly
held
that,
with
respect
to
the
second
clause
of
the
seventh
amendment,
the
one
that's
at
issue
here,
that
cases
coming
up
from
state
courts
for
purposes
of
review
are
governed
by
the
seventh
amendment.
and,
in
fact,
that
oral
argument
in
the
new
york
times
justice
goldberg
asked
counsel
for
the
respondent
when
he
raised
that
very
issue
with
the
seventh
amendment...
how
could
apply
here...
and
was
cited
to
that
case.
mr.
lee
levine
yes,
we
have...
you
have,
your
honor.
[laughter]
and...
and,
indeed,
in
the
footnote
in
new
york
times
in
which
that
proposition
was
rejected...
the
proposition
that
the
seventh
amendment
posed
any
conflict
with
the
first
amendment
in
actual
malice
determinations...
the
court
acknowledged
that
the
seventh
amendment
did
apply
to
that
case.
now,
there
is
another
unwarranted
by-product
to
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
and
that
is
that
it
necessarily
credits
as
determinative
evidence
of
actual
malice,
evidence
of
little,
if
any,
probative
value
on
the
issue
of
actual
malice.
such
as
evidence
that
a
newspaper
competes
for
circulation
with
other
media.
that
it
editorially--
mr.
lee
levine
--the
trial
court
gave
the
definition
of
actual
malice
to
the
jury
in
its
charge
that
included
reckless
disregard.
yes,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
lee
levine
in
this
case
i
believe
my
opponent
has
suggested
that
there
is
direct
evidence
of
an
admission
of
knowledge
of
falsehood,
but
i
think
in
fairness
this
case
is
really
about
whether
the
circumstantial
evidence
in
the
record
adds
up
to
reckless
disregard
for
the
truth.
we
think
that
under
any
standard
of
review,
even
a
clearly
erroneous
standard,
the
evidence
in
this
record
is
insufficient,
as
judge
guy
held
in
his
dissent
from
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
to
justify
a
finding
of
actual
malice.
mr.
lee
levine
your
honor,
the
answer
to
that
question
depends
on
who
has
the
burden
of
proof
in
the
case.
in
this
case,
the
plaintiff
has
the
burden
of
proof.
it
not
only
has
the
burden
of
proof,
but
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
if
the
plaintiff
put
on
evidence
and
had
witnesses
or
the
possibility
of
witnesses
within
its
subpoena
power
or
control
that
it
could
have
put
on
to
contradict
what
thompson
had
to
say,
i
would
grant
you
that
in
reviewing--
mr.
lee
levine
--in
this
case
what
we're
suggesting
is
that
a
reviewing
court
is
not
automatically
required
to
discount
that
testimony
on
the
basis
that
it
is
required
to
defer
to
a
jury
finding
that
she
wasn't
believed.
we
say,
though,
an
independent
review
encompasses
the
entire
record.
it
gives
the
reviewing
court
the
right
to
look
at
that
evidence,
assuming
that
the
other
party
had
the
burden
of
proof
of
proving
those
facts
and
proving
the
ultimate
issue
of
actual
malice.
the
evidence
that
the
court
of
appeals
credited
in
this
case,
competing
with
other
media,
endorsing
editorially
the
plaintiff's
opponent,
and
failing
to
investigate
as
thoroughly
as
the
plaintiff
might
have
preferred
prior
to
publication...
that
evidence,
this
court
has
repeatedly
held,
is
of
tenuous
if
any
probative
value
with
respect
to
a
motive
to
falsify.
yet,
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
effectively
requires
a
reviewing
court
to
draw
an
inference
of
actual
malice
from
such
testimony
in
every
case
in
which
a
jury
is
found
in
favor
of
a
political
candidate
and
against
a
newspaper.
in
such
cases,
the
newspaper
literally
starts
out
with
three
strikes
against
it
because
it
will
always
compete
with
some
other
media,
it
will
virtually
always
endorse
candidates
for
public
office,
and
it
will
always
be
subject
to
second-guessing
when
the
scope
of
its
investigation...
not
whether
it
investigated
at
all...
judged
by
20/20
hindsight.
but
the
issue
in
this
case
is
not
the
abstract
relevance
of
these
categories
of
circumstantial
evidence
to
the
actual
malice
inquiry.
it
is,
rather,
whether
the
court
of
appeals
analysis
which
requires
that
this
evidence
be
credited
in
every
single
case
is
consistent
with
the
rule
of
independent
review.
it
most
surely
is
not.
the
independent
review
contemplated
by
new
york
times
and
by
bose
is
in
this
court's
own
words
de
novo
review.
it
calls
on
courts
to
make
a
uniquely
constitutional
judgment,
a
judgment
about
whether
expression
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
to
do
that,
a
court
must
review
the
entire
record,
including
undisputed
evidence
favoring
the
defendant.
to
do
that,
a
reviewing
court
must
draw
its
own
inferences
from
the
record
evidence
and
not
defer
to
an
array
of
hypothetical
subsidiary
facts
that
a
jury
could
have
found.
this
court
has
been
making
such
determinations
and
exercising
such
independent
review
in
first
amendment
cases
since
at
least
its
1927
decision
in
fiske
v.
kansas.
such
review
is
not
only
within
the
legitimate
power
of
appellate
courts,
it
is
a
constitutional
obligation
placed
upon
appellate
courts
by
the
first
amendment
itself.
mr.
lee
levine
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
lee
levine
your
honor,
for
purposes
of
this
proceeding
be
concede
that
it
is
susceptible
to
a
defamatory
interpretation
which
is
false.
yes.
mr.
lee
levine
we're
conceding
it
for
this
purpose.
there
was
an
issue
submitted
to
the
jury
and
they
found
that.
but,
your
honor,
i
agree
with
you
emphatically.
that
even
under
a
clearly
erroneous
standard
of
review,
as
judge
guy
held
in
dissent
from
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
this
judgment
can't
stand.
mr.
lee
levine
i
would
have
no
trouble
arguing
that
new
york
times
itself
very
clearly
and
expressly
says
that
appellate
courts
have
a
constitutional
obligation
to
undertake
just
the
kind
of
independent
review
that
bose
talks
about.
in
my
view
and
in
the
court's
own
view
in...
all
bose
does
is
reaffirm
new
york
times.
it
doesn't
extend
it.
it
doesn't
grant
the
press
any
more
rights
that
they
had
under
new
york
times
v.
sullivan.
and
that's
because
new
york
times
teaches
that
the
actual
malice
standard
by
itself
doesn't
provide
sufficient
protection
against
jury
verdicts
erroneously
punishing
protected
expression.
the
rule
of
independent
review
and
the
actual
malice
standard
are
inextricably
intertwined.
mr.
lee
levine
your
honor,
new
york
times
teaches
us
that
the
line
separating
protected
from
unprotected
expression,
which
is
what
new
york
times
talks
about,
is
a
more
difficult,
a
more
sensitive
line
to
draw
than
that
that's
in
the
typical
civil
case
separating
protected
from...
permissible
from
culpable
conduct.
we
regularly
assign
to
juries
the
task
of
distinguishing,
for
example,
negligent
from
responsible
driving.
but
the
first
amendment
withholds
from
the
civil
jury
final
authority
to
hold
the
political
speeches
not
worthy
of
protection
by
the
first
amendment.
that
task
is
assigned
to
appellate
courts
through
the
process
of
independent
appellate
review.
most
seriously
litigated
libel
cases
like
this
one
don't
involve
readily
ascertainable
matters
of
truth
or
falsity.
they
deal,
instead,
with
the
quite
debatable
implications
of
conflicting
versions
of
controverted
events.
it
is
because
of
this
reality
that
new
york
times
places
upon
the
plaintiff
the
affirmative
burden
of
proving
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
expression
is
unworthy
of
first
amendment
protection.
the
burden--
mr.
lee
levine
--in
this
case,
your
honor,
no.
mr.
lee
levine
but...
but
we're
lucky
here,
your
honor,
for
the
following
reason.
we've
got
a
tape
recording.
we've
got
a
tape
recording
of
an
interview
with
the
plaintiff
in
which
the
plaintiff
concedes
that
these
subjects
were
discussed,
that
these
conversations
took
place,
that
what
our
primary
source
said
had
the
ring
of
truth.
when
you
put
that
tape
recording
into
the
mix,
all
the
inferences
that
would
need
to
be
drawn
to
get
the
clear
and
convincing
proof
of
actual
malice
get
cut
off.
and
i
agree
with
you,
that
no
jury
could
have
found
clear
and
convincing
evidence
of
actual
malice
on
this
record.
in
the
typical
case,
i'm
not
so
sure
that
other
defendants
are
going
to
be
that
lucky.
and
if
you
don't
have
that
evidence
which
a...
which
a
court
can
reach
out
and
touch,
you're
not
going
to
have
the
ability,
without
drawing
your
own
inferences,
to
protect
speech
that
ought
to
be
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
if
i
could
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
lee
levine
i'd
like
just
to
address
a
couple
of
points.
first,
in
response
to
justice
stephens'
question
of
mr.
lloyd,
it
is
indisputably
true
and
one
of
those
undisputed
facts
in
this
record
that
a
reviewing
court
should
credit
that
this...
the
tape
recordings
of
which
mr.
lloyd
refers
run
two
hours
and
20
minutes.
by
the
shortest
estimate
of
any
of
the
participants
in
that
all-night
meeting,
that
meeting
lasted
four
hours.
that
means
that
there
is,
by
my
count,
an
hour
and
40
minutes
that
is
unaccounted
for.
so,
listening
to
the
tapes,
in
my
view,
is
an
incredible
red
herring
in
this
case.
the
tape
that
ought
to
be
listened
to,
your
honors,
is
the
tape
of
the
interview
that
the
journal
news
conducted
with
dan
connaughton,
the
one
that
justice
stevens
was
talking
about.
there
is
a
complete
transcript
of
that
tape-recorded
interview
in
the
joint
appendix.
we
understand
that
the
tape
recording
itself
remains
in
the
custody
of
the
district
court
but
is
a
alliable
to
this
court
upon
request.
mr.
lee
levine
your
honor,
it
is
undisputed
we
did
not
talk
to
her
and
it
would
have
been
a
better
story
if
we
had.
but
when
you
take
that
one
fact
and
all
the
others
that
mr.
lloyd...
pure
facts--
mr.
lee
levine
--your
honor,
with
all
due
respect
i
think
that
if
you
read
patsy
stephens'
testimony
in
the
trial
of
this
case,
which
is
the
best
indication
we
have
of
what
she
would
have
said
had
she
been
interviewed,
she
does
not
deny.
she
says,
in
fact,
that
it's
all
a
matter
of
how
you
interpret
it.
it's
how
a
person
feels
within.
when
someone
gives
you
something
out
of
their
heart,
that's
not...
i
don't
view
that
as
a
promise
or
an
offer.
mr.
lee
levine
it
is...
it
is
a
denial
that
she
interpreted
it
as
an
offer.
mr.
lee
levine
but
it...
but
it
doesn't
bear
at
all
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
those
statements
were
made--
mr.
lee
levine
--justice
scalia,
on
this
record
you
take
the
position
that
patsy
stephens
testified
at
trial
that
she
did
not
believe
she
was
promised
anything--
mr.
lee
levine
--at
that
time.
and
that
is
a
fact
that
you
weigh
in
the
balance.
but,
even
given
that,
and
that
is
concededly
the
most
harmful
piece
of
evidence
in
this
record...
although
i
would
point
the
court
to
statements
in
cases
from
st.
amant
v.
thompson
that
failure
to
investigate
does
not
constitute
actual
malice...
that
an
independent
review
of
this
record
can
leave
no
doubt
that
the
expression
at
issue
here
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
the
article
at
issue,
not
the
most
defamatory
interpretations
of
it
that
mr.
lloyd
would
have
you
believe...
the
article
itself
is
a
fair
and
accurate
account
both
of
alice
thompson's
statements
and
of
mr.
and
mrs.
connaughton's
responses
to
them.
the
article
references
conversations
that
mr.
connaughton
concedes
took
place
and
subjects
that
he
concedes
were
discussed.
the
article
was
disseminated
in
the
midst
of
a
hotly-contested
election
campaign.
mr.
lee
levine
your
honor,
i
see
no
falsity
in
this
story.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
look
at
this
article,
the
article
that
was
actually
written,
it
contains
nothing
that
i
would
call
a
material
false
statement.
but
this
jury
found
falsity,
and
we
sought
independent
review
only
of
the
actual
malice
inquiry.
so
i'm
here
on
the
question
of
actual
malice,
not
falsity.
what
happened
here
was
that
this
newspaper
neutrally
but
before
the
voters
both
the
charges
made
by
alice
thompson
and
the
responses
of
the
connaughtons
to
them.
it
did
it
unvarnished,
without
taking
sides,
without
crediting
one
interpretation
or
the
other.
that's
not--
mr.
lee
levine
--if
there
was...
if
there
was
evidence
like
in
the
cantrell
case
that
this
newspaper
knew
it
was
false?
mr.
lee
levine
under
the
actual
malice--
mr.
lee
levine
--standard
that's
no
good.
mr.
lee
levine
i
missed
the
first
part
of...
of
your--
mr.
lee
levine
--what
you
were--
mr.
lee
levine
--your
honor,
in
garrison
v.
louisiana,
a
jury
instruction
that
said
effectively
that
was
held
to
be
unconstitutional...
that
you
had
to
have
a
firm
enough
reason
to
believe
that
it
was
true.
and
that,
this
court
held,
was
not
enough,
you
have
to
have
a
high
degree
of
awareness
of
probable
falsity.
that's
the
definition
of
actual
malice.
