well,
mr.
bryson,
i
suppose
personal
correspondence
can
also
pose
security
threats
sometimes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
fact,
that
might
be
more
of
a
risk
than
this
type
of
publication.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
standard
do
you
think
applies
to
review
of
personal
correspondence?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
isn't
it
difficult
to
break
this,
the
standard
down
according
to
the
type
of
correspondence,
and
you,
you
run
into
some
real
problems?
what
about
letters

think
you're
asking
the
court
to
apply
a
rather
confusing
breakdown
of
standard.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what's
the
real
difficulty
of
applying
that
standard
to
these
publications
as
a
practical
matter?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
for
personal
correspondence?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
publications
do
you
suppose
could
be
prohibited
under
the
martinez
standard?
