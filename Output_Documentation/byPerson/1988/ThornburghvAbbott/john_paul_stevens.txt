john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
are
the
materials
that
are
excluded
primarily
pictorial
or
written
materials?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
if,
if
you
are
trying
to
prevent
somebody,
prevent
somebody
from
reading
the
material,
he
could
read
it
to
prepare
his
appeal
from
not
being
able
to
read
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
not
sure
that's
right.
in
the
prison
union
context
you
simply
disagree
with
the
views
of
those
advocating
prisoner'
unions.
maybe
it's
a
reasonable
disagreement,
but
it's
surely
a
viewpoint-based
exclusion,--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
but
i
think
if
you
would...
in
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question,
you
would
exclude
a
publication...
i
understand
most
of
them
are
not
this
kind,
but
which
merely
contained
an
article
saying
we
think
in
the
long
run
prisons
would
be
run
better
if
wardens
would
understand
that
unions
could
form
a
useful,
perform
a
useful
function
or
something
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
i'm
just
a
little
confused
about
the
difference
between
procunier
and
this
case.
the
fact
that
the
prison
is
obviously
a
non-public
forum,
what...
what
did
that
have
to
do
with
the
analysis
in
the
procunier
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
was
just
as
non-public
for
people
who
are
writing
letters,
or
people
who
are
writing
letters
enclosing
magazines.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
know
how
it
advances
the
problem.
that's
really
what
i'm
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
your
view,
could
a
magazine
advocating
the
organization
of
a
prisoners'
union
be
distributed
under
the
procunier
standard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
say
a...
i'm
talking
about
bulk
mailings
now.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
talking
about
the
problem
of
a
friend
sending
a
copy
of
an
article
or
a
copy
of
a
magazine.
would
the
publisher
of
a
magazine
advocating
the
formation
of
a
prisoners'
union
have
a
right
under
the
procunier
standard
to
have
that
publication
distributed
within
the
prison,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
do,
do
you
have
a
right
to
make
a
bulk
mailing
to
the
prison
of
that
magazine?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
said
when
you
started
that
you
represented
publishers.
you
weren't
representing
the
inmates.
you
were
talking
about
the
point
of
view
of
the
publishers,
and
i'm
asking
you
if
you
represent
a
magazine
that
advocates
the
formation
of
a
prisoners'
union
and
you
contend
that
the
procunier
standard
applies,
would
you
have
a
constitutional
right
to
have,
to
send
that
magazine
to
inmates?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
are
there...
can
you
give
me
an
example
of
a
magazine
in
which
a
different
standard
would
produce
a
different
result?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
that
two
standards
will
send
different
signals.
can
you
give
me
an
example
of
a
magazine
that
would
succeed
under
one
standard
and
fall
under
the
other?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
all
these
publications
should
come
in
even
under
the
reasonableness
standard.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
this
is
kind
of
a
symbolic
case
is
what
it
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
another
question
just
about
the
general
framework
of
the
case
that
i
just
don't
quite
understand?
you're...
i
can
understand
the
interest
of
the
prisoners
in
getting
access
to
as
much
different
kinds
of
material
as
they
can,
but
you
made
the
particular
point
that
you're
representing
publishers,
and
i
just
wonder
what
kind
of
a
market
do
the
publishers
have
in
the
prisons?
most
of
these
people
can't
afford
to
subscribe
to
publications,
can
they?
are
these
publishers
that
are
distributed
for,
you
know,
for...
like
the
washington
post
or
something
like
that,
you've
got
to
pay
a
substantial
amount
of
money
for?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
kind
of
publications
are
we
really
talking
about?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
certainly
not
a
very
big
market,
is
it?
financially?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
these
heterosexual
publications,
those
are
things,
i
suppose,
the
prisoners
subscribe
for,
aren't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
these
other
publications
are,
are...
well,
i
just...
i
just
don't
quite
know
what
they
are,
i
guess.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
all-or-nothing
rule
work
on
a,
on
a
magazine
by
magazine
base...
what
i
mean,
is
it
just
a
particular
issue
that
will
be
excluded,
or
once,
once
you
get
or
the
list,
is
the
whole,
is
the
publication
banned
entirely?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
now
it
would
be
just
one
particular
issue
of
a
magazine
would
be
excluded.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bryson,
i
suppose
you
would
contend
that
call
ought
to
be
kept
out
under...
even
under
the
procunier
standard?
