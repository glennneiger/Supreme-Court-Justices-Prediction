is,
isn't
it
fair
to
say,
though,
that
in
martinez
we
were
dealing
with
correspondence
that
was
intended
for
and
sent
to
individual
prisoners,
but
the
material
here
is
designed
to
appeal
to
prisoners
as
a
group,
and
that
therefore
there
is
a
much
greater
danger
that
there
would
be
group
disruptive
conduct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
both
cases
that
you
put,
the
publication
is
intended
for
an
audience
of
more
than
one,
and
that
was
not
true
in
martinez.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
government
is
concerned
here
with
group
disruption.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it's...
the
material
is
designed
to
appeal
to
a
group.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
well,
is
the
government
going
to
tell
us
in
closing,
if
it
has
time,
that
that's
just
an
instance
where
the
policy
was
misapplied
and
it
concedes
error,
and
that's
the
end
of
the
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i
mean,
if
it
does--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--we
still
have
the
question
of
what
the
standard
ought
to
be.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mere,
mere,
merely
because
a
standard
is
misapplied,
it
doesn't
mean
the
standard
is
invalid,
does
it?
