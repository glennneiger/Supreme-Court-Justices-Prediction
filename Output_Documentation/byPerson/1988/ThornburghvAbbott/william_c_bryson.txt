mr.
william
c.
bryson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
what
standard
should
be
applied
by
courts
in
confronting
the
censorship
of
publications
sent
into
federal
prisons
for
inmates.
the
question
is
whether
the
reasonableness
standard
should
be
used,
which
is
the
standard
that
this
court
has
articulated
on
a
number
of
occasions
with
respect
to
prisoners'
rights
in
cases
during
the
last
15
years,
or
the
heightened
scrutiny
standard
of
the
decision
in
procunler
against
martinez.
the
reasonableness
standard
is
perhaps
best
articulated
as
a
standard
in
which
the
action
of
the
prison
officials
is
to
be
upheld
if
it
is
reasonably
related
to
a
valid
penological
concern,
as
long
as
there
is
not
substantial
evidence
that
the
reaction,
the
action,
the
regulation
or
whatnot,
is
an
exaggerated
response
by
the
prison
officials.
the
heightened
scrutiny
standard
from
procunler
is
that
the
regulation
must
actually
further
an
important
governmental
interest
and
go
no
farther
than
is
necessary
or
essential
to
do
that.
now,
the
regulations
in
this
case
that
are
at
issue
are
regulations
which
were
first
promulgated
in
1979.
they
have
precursors
that
go
back
many
years,
but
the
particular
regulations
that
are
at
issue
are
the
1979
regulations
as
modified
by
1980
and
1985
policy
statements
of
the
bureau
of
prisons.
this
adds
some
complication
to
the
case
because
most
of
the
publications
that
are
at
issue
in
the
case
that
the
plaintiffs
protest
their
exclusion
were
excluded
in
1977
and
1978,
before
the
actual
promulgation
of
the
new
policy
and
before
the
promulgation
of
the
policy
statement
that
deals
with
sexually
oriented
publications.
but
the
basic
gist
of
the
regulation
is
pretty
much
the
same.
it
has
been
changed
in
some
particulars.
it
has
been
made
tighter
as
far
as
procedural
protections
go.
but
the
basic
components
of
the
policy
are
still
the
same
as
they
were
in
1977
and,
indeed,
back
in
1973
when
this
case
was
first
filed.
and
the--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
your
honor,
it's
not
a...
there's
no
doubt
about
its
being
a
live
controversy.
what
may
not
be
live
in
this
regard
are...
and
the
court
of
appeals
acknowledged
this...
are
the
challenges
to
the
rejection
of
these
46
publications
that
are
at
issue
in
the
case.
these
46
publications
all
are
publications
that
were
rejected
in
1977
and
1978.
these
publications,
there
was
testimony
at
trial
to
show,
might
very
well
have
been
admitted
under
the
new
policy,
but
in
any
event,
the
court
of
appeals
sent
this
case
back
to
the
district
court
for
an
assessment,
among
other
things,
of
whether
there's
any
further
controversy
with
respect
to
those
publications.
what
isn't
in
doubt
is
that
there's
a
continuing
dispute
about
the
validity
of
the
standard
that
should
be
applied
in
this
case;
that
is
to
say,
whether
procunler,
the
standard
or
the
reasonableness
standard
should
apply.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
some
of
whom
are
still
incarcerated,
yes.
now,
the
point
of
the
original
plaintiffs
go
back
to
1973.
some
of
these
people
are
still
incarcerated,
and
in
any
event,
it's
a
class
action
and
was
certified
at
such
at
some
point.
now,
the
regulation
that's
at
issue
in
this
case...
and
i'd
like
to
spend
a
little
more
time
on
the
facts
perhaps
than
i
normally
would
because
they
are
somewhat
intricate...
but
the
regulation
that's
at
issue
says
that
a
warden
may
reject
a
publication
only
if
it
is
determined
detrimental
to
the
security,
good
order
or
discipline
of
the
institution,
or
if
it
might
facilitate
criminal
activity.
the
regulation
then
goes
on
to
say
that
the
warden
may
not
reject
a
publication
solely
because
its
content
is
religious,
philosophical,
political,
social
or
sexual.
the
regulation
then
contains
a
series
of
examples
of
specific,
dealing
with
specific
areas,
directing
when
the
warden
can
exclude
particular
types
of
materials
such
as
materials
that
are
in
code,
materials
that
depict
escape
plans,
materials
that
depict,
encourage
or
describe
methods
of
escape
and
may
lead
to
the
use
of
physical
violence
or
group
disruption.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
some
of
them
certainly
are
sexually
explicit
magazines,
and
here,
your
honor,
is
a
perfect
example
of
why
i
think
the
materials
that
are,
the
specific
materials
that
are
in
dispute
in
this
case
would
probably
be
handled
quite
differently
from
the
way
they
were
back
in
1977
and
1978
when
they
were
rejected.
the
materials
that
are
dealt
with
under
the
sexual...
sexual
materials
provision
of
the
regulation
are
sexually
explicit
materials,
but
the
wardens
are
advised
by
the
policy
statement
of
1980
that
heterosexual
materials
normally
will
not
be
excluded,
even
if
they
are
sexually
explicit
materials.
now,
there
are
exceptions
to
to
this
which
include
sadomasochistic
materials,
bestiality
and
child
pornography,
but
by
and
large,
heterosexual
materials,
even
if
sexually
explicit,
will
be
admitted.
and
this
is
the
program
statement
that
is
found
in
the
appendix
to
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
again,
there
were
materials
that
were
kept
out
in
1977
and
'78
which
the
plaintiffs
protested,
but
those
materials,
at
least
with
respect
to
sexually
explicit
heterosexual
materials,
probably
would
now
come
in.
the
district
court
upheld
the
regulations
facially
and
as
applied.
the
court
found
after
a
ten-day
trial
in
which
evidence
was
taken
from
both
the
plaintiffs'
experts
and
from
the
defense
experts,
including
a
number
of
wardens
and
regional
directors
and
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
prisons...
the
district
court
found
that
violence
in
federal
prisons
is
a
major
problem
and
that
it
is
caused
in
major
part
by
ethnic
gangs
and
homosexual
activities.
many
assaults,
the
district
court
found...
and
there
are
a
lot
of
assaults
in
federal
prison,
both
on
other
inmates
and
on
prison
guards...
many
of
the
assault...
assaults
are
precipitated,
the
district
court
found,
or
manifested
by
homosexual
activity.
these
publications--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--it
upheld
the
current
regulations,
your
honor,
the
1979
regulations.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
the
trial
was
in
1981--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--and
the
district
court's
decision
was
1984.
so
the
'79
regulations
were
in
effect
at
that
time.
they
are
the
regulations
which
the
facial
challenge
to
which
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
your
honor,
the
basic
principle,
the
principle
that
matters
that
are
detrimental
to
the
good
order,
security
and
discipline
of
the,
of
the
prison,
that
was
not
changed.
so
the
core
idea
of
the
whole
regulations
was
the
same
as
it
has
been
since
1975.
but
what
was
changed
was
these
particular
applications,
these
directions
to
the
wardens
was...
those
were
added
in
1979.
in
addition,
the
more
liberal
policy
with
respect
to
sexually
explicit
materials
was
instituted
in
1980,
and
perhaps
particularly
important
for
the
purpose
of
procedural
objections
that
are
raised
here,
a
number
of
changes
were
made
in
the
regulations
to
provide,
for
example,
a
more
extensive
review
process
for
the
inmates.
the
inmates,
under
new
regulations,
can
see
the
materials
prior
to
taking
an
appeal
from
the,
from
the
rejection
by
the
warden
in
most
cases,
and
the...
there
is
an
effort
made
to
attain
more
uniformity
in
the
prison
system
by
virtue
of
an
appeal
system
which
was
much
more
rudimentary
back
in
the
'70s.
so
there
were
procedural
changes.
but
the
basic
core
provision
is
essentially
the
same.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
they're...
they
fall
into
both
categories,
your
honor.
the
pictorial--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
there
is
a
provision
that
says
he
can,
he
can
read
it
in
cases
where
there
is
not
deemed
to
be
some
great
harm
from
his
reading
it.
the
problem
is
not,
your
honor,
in
the
individual
reading
the
materials
in
most
cases.
the
problem
is
in
the
material
getting
into
the
prison.
that
is,
in
most
instances
the
warden
doesn't
worry
about
individual
no.
1
reading
particular,
particular
materials.
the
danger
is
in
their
becoming
passed
around
within
the
prison.
so
there
are,
there
is
a
class
of
cases,
it's
not
all
the
cases,
but
some
cases
in
which
there
is
deemed
to
be
no
great
harm
to
having
the
individual
read
the
materials
in
preparing
his
appeal
but
in
which
we
want
to
take
the
position
that
the
material
should
not
come
in
for
free
distribution
in
the
prison.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
oh,
certainly.
for
example,
to
take
perhaps
the
best
example,
publications
advocating
prison
unions.
prison
unions
are,
are,
frankly,
anathema
to
the
prison
system.
it's
completely
contrary
to
the
efforts
of
the
prison
system
to
obtain
discipline
and
good
order
within
the
prison
system,
and
we
keep
out
publications
that
advocate
unionism
among
the,
among
the
prisoners.
we
also
keep
out
some
homosexually
explicit
materials
because
of
the
concern,
and
it's
a
two-told
concern,
that
there
will
be
targeting
of
particular
individuals
as
being
homosexuals
who
would
then
be
subjects
of
assault,
and
also
because,
frankly,
it
tends
to,
as
several
of
the
witnesses
stated
at
trial,
it
tends
to
suggest
that
the
institution
condones
this
form
of
behavior
and
therefore
results
in
more
of
that
form
of
behavior
which
is
inimical
to
the
operation
of
the
prison
in
an
orderly
way.
so
those
two
classes,
for
example--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--no.
sexually,
sexually
explicit
heterosexual
materials
are,
the
provision
states,
normally
admitted.
now,
there
may
be
exceptions
if,
for
example,
some
sexually
explicit
heterosexual
material
wanders
over
into
the
area
of
child
pornography,
bestiality
or
sadomasochistic
materials.
but
generally
speaking,
that's
true,
you
don't...
we
don't
keep
out
heterosexual
materials.
now,
the
district
court
found
that
publications
can
present
a
security
threat,
and
particular
publications
of
the
sort
that
were
at
issue
in
this
case
can
present
a
security
threat.
there's
suggestion
in
the
respondents'
brief,
and
it
has
been
their
position
all
along,
that
this
is
not
a
realistic
concern,
that
there's
no
indication
that
any
assaults
have
occurred
as
a
direct
result
of
the
admission
of
publications,
and
therefore,
any
reaction
on
the
part
of
the
prison
officials
to
the
admission
of
publications
is
an
exaggerated
response,
it
is
not
tailored.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
it
can,
and
we
do
regulate
personal
correspondence.
certain
types
of
items,
obviously,
escape
plans,
to
take
the
most
conspicuous
example,
would
be
excluded.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
it
would
depend
on
what
it
was.
certainly,
if
it
was
an
escape
plan,
you
bet,
we
would
keep
it
out,
just
as
we
would
a
publication
that
published,
for
example,
the,
the
plans
to
marion
penitentiary.
we
would
keep
that
out,
i'm
confident.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
think
as
a
general
matter
the
martinez
standard
applies,
the
procunier
against
martinez
standard
applies.
our
position
in
this
case
is
that,
as
a
class,
the,
the
cases
involving
personal
correspondence
have
a
more
compelling
argument
to
be
made
for
them
that
they
should
be
admitted
into
the
prisons
than
publication
because--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--there's
no,
there's
no
doubt
that--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
it
certainly
is...
the
proliferation
of
standards
is
a
real
problem,
and
i
don't,
i
don't
underestimate
the
difficulties
that
that
presents,
both
for
the
courts
and
also
for
the
administrators.
we
have
the
procunler
decision,
and
that
decision
sets
forth
a
standard
that
is
applicable
to
direct
personal
correspondence
between
individuals
on
the
outside
and
individuals
on
the
inside.
our,
our
point
in
this--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--i
guess
the
biggest
difficulty,
your
honor,
is
more
in
the
misapplication,
i
think,
of
that
standard
than
in
its
application,
and
this
case
is
a
perfect
example
of
its
misapplication.
the
mischief
is
in
the
requirement
that
the
regulation
go
"no
farther
than
necessary",
and
that
has
been
interpreted,
and
indeed.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
it
has
initially
intended,
in
all
likelihood,
as
a
least
restrictive
alternative
type
rule;
that
is
to
say,
if
there's
some
way
that
this
particular
regulation
could
be
narrowed,
then
it
constitutionally
must
be
so
narrowed.
that
least
restrictive
alternative,
as
the
court
noted
in
the
turner
case,
that
approach
to
prison...
the
regulation
of
activities
within
a
prison,
tends
to
put
the
wardens
in
a
position
that
they
can
be
second-guessed
by
the
court
at
every
turn.
that's
the
mischief,
i
think.
it
the,
the
standard
in
procunler
is
not
a,
it's
a
somewhat
amorphous
standard,
frankly.
it
is
a
standard
which
is
subject,
i
think,
to
interpretation
as
a
kind
of
enhanced
reasonableness
test.
the
mischief
as
i
say,
is
in
this
least
restrictive
alternative
aspect
of
the
test.
if
you
were
to
say
that
is
not
the
way
procunier
should
be
read,
to
have
a
least
restrictive
alternative
requirement...
and
that
is
decidedly
not
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
read
it
in
this
case...
but
if
this
court
were
to
say
that
is
not
the
way
procunler
was...
is
to
be
read,
then
i
think
the
standard
of
that
case
could
be
squared
with
the
standard
that
this
court
adopted
in
turner
for
reasonableness.
we
would
advocate
a
reasonableness
test
across
the
board.
we
have
procunler
on
the,
on
the
books
with
respect
to
direct,
personal
correspondence?
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
think
that
reasonableness,
particularly
the
kind
of
reasonableness
and
analysis
that
this
court
spelled
out
in
turner,
makes
great
sense
for
any
form
of
publication.
in
turner
this
court
made
quite
clear
that
reasonableness
does
not
mean
complete,
abject
deference
to
the
warden
no
matter
what.
it
means
that
you
have
to
show
some
valid
connection
with
a
legitimate
penological
interest
and
that
there
are
not
easy
alternatives
which
could
solve
the
same
problem.
there
are
a
number
of,
of
features
to
the
reasonableness
test
that
this
type
of
case
the
court
laid
out
in
turner
which
we
would
believe
should
be
applied
across
the
board.
but,
as
i
say,
to
the
extent
that
procunler
is
read
as
being
inconsistent
with
turner
and
it
is
certainly
possible
to
read
it
that
way,
and
indeed,
that's
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
read
it,
we
submit
that
procunler
should
not
be
extended
to
this
class
of
cases,
which
is
not
as
compelling
a
class
of
cases
as
the
direct
personal
correspondence.
and
the
reason--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--oh,
yes,
no
question.
they
expressly
did
not...
the
court
expressly
did
not
reach
the
class
of
cases
such
as
this
one.
the
court
was
dealing
and
expressly
with
the
limited
class
of
cases
involving
direct
personal
correspondence.
now,
the
court
of
appeals,
as
i
say,
struck
down
this,
these
regulations
on
their
face
and,
in
the
course
of
doing
so,
imposed
an
extraordinarily
exacting
standard
on
the
prison
officials.
for
example,
the
court
said
with
respect
to
the
provision
that
states
that
materials
that
instruct
in
criminal
activity
will
be
excluded,
the
court
said
that
that
wasn't
sufficient.
the
court
explained
that
there
was
no
requirement,
no
requirement
in
the
regulations
that
the
warden
find
a
probability
that
the
publication
will
result
in
a
breach
of
security.
now,
that's
asking
an
awful
lot,
to
say
that
instruct...
materials
that
instruct
in
criminal
activity
cannot
be
excluded
from
a
prison
because
there
is
no
likelihood,
no
probability
that
the
publication
will
result
in
a
breach
of
security
or
order.
now,
there
are
various
other
provisions
in
the...
various
other
statements
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
in
which
essentially
the
same
approach
is
taken,
which
is
to
say
you
have
to
establish
a
likelihood
that
something
will
actually
happen
as
a
result
of
the
admission
of
these
materials.
we
think
the
district
court
got
it
right
when
the
district
court
said
at
page
32a
of
the
petition
appendix,
that
wardens
should
not
be
required
to
show
a
likely,
immediate
or
substantial
threat
of
a
breach
of
security
or
order.
that,
as
the
district
court
explained,
would
require
the
admission
of
publications
that
could
exacerbate
tensions
and
lead
indirectly
to
disorder.
now--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--no.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
not
no,
it
depends
on,
it
would
depend
on
the...
it
would
depend,
of
course,
on,
on,
on
what...
how
that
was
put.
i
mean,
if
the
advocacy
for
better
food
was
to
say
go
on
a
food
strike
until
we
get
better
foods,
yes,
we
would
probably
keep
it
out.
the
point
of
union
publications--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
i,
i
don't
know,
frankly,
whether
something
that
was
put
in
that,
in
that
way
would
be
excluded
because
it
would
be
so
much,
so
much,
so
much
closer
to
simply
informational
material
rather
than
advocacy,
but
in
cases
in
which
what
is
being
urged...
and
this
is
uniformly
the
case
with
these
materials...
what
is
being
urged
is
actual
unionization
itself;
that
is
to
say,
unionize,
engage
in
collective
action
against
the
prison
officials,
those
materials
we
keep
out.
and
that's
what
we're
dealing
with
when
we
deal
with
prison
union
materials.
it
is,
i
think,
even
if
martinez
is
good
law
with
respect
to
correspondence
itself,
when
it's
applied
outside
that
setting,
outside
the
setting
that
it
defined
itself
as,
as
the
appropriate
setting,
then
you
run
into,
in
addition
to
the
problems
that
i've
discussed,
you
run
into
the
line
of
cases
from
this
court
dealing
with
non-public
forums.
and
those
cases
make
quite
clear
that
a
prison
is
the
ultimate
non-public
forums
and
the
rule
that
applies
in
non-public
forum
cases
is,
again,
the
reasonableness
test,
essentially,
exactly
the
test
that
the
court
has
adopted
for
the
rights
of
prisoners
themselves.
and
we
are
urging
that
that
rule
be
applied
to
the
rights
of
those
who
are
seeking
to
send
materials
into
the
prison,
a
non-public
forum.
and
that
test
is
perhaps
best
put
in
the
perry
education
association
case
when
the
court
said
that
regulation
must
be
reasonable
and
not
an
effort
to
suppress
expression
merely
because
public
officials
oppose
the
speaker's
view.
now,
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
regulations
in
and
of
themselves
made
quite
clear
that
suppression
is
not
done
simply
because
of
disagreement
with
the
speaker's
views.
suppression
is,
is
tied
to
the
effects.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
your
honor,
the
reason
we
exclude
in
that
class
of
cases,
as
in
every
other
class
of
cases,
is
not
because
we
disagree
with
the
views
but
because
we
are
concerned
about
the
effects,
and
the
effects
of
publications
that
say
unionize
are
that,
typically,
they
will
produce
or
can
be
expected
to
produce,
intransigence
and
resistance
on
the
part
of
prisoners.
that
is
bad
news
for
the
prison
when
prison
officials
try
to
run
an
orderly
shop
and
the
prisoners
are
being
urged
to
and
in
fact
engage
in
collective
action.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
have
never
seen
an
article
come
through
that
was
of
that
nature,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would
be
excluded.
the
warden
would
have
to
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
that
would
be
likely
to
result
in
the
collective
action
that
is
the
real
concern--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--the
disruptive,
group
disruption.
if
the
warden
did
not
rationally,
could
not
rationally
draw
that
conclusion,
then
the
material
would
come
in.
but
again,
it's...
the
focus
is
on
the
likelihood
of
group
disruption,
not
on
disagreement
with
the
views.
it
may
be
that
the
warden
would
disagree
with
the
views,
but
that
is
not
the
purpose
of
the
regulation.
that's
not
the
justification
for
the
regulation.
again,
on
the
non-public
forum
issue,
the
respondents
argue
that
this,
the
court's
cases
on
non-public
forum
don't
apply
because,
for
several
reasons:
first,
they
say,
because
the
mails
are
at
issue
here,
not
the
prisons,
the
mails
are
the
forum.
well,
that
really
don't
do
as
an
answer
because
the
place
where
the
materials
are
circulated,
the
place
where
the
materials
are
sent,
is
the
prison.
in
jones
against
north
carolina
prisoners'
union,
the
court
clearly
said
that
the
prisons
were
a
non-public
forum
in
response
to
an
argument
that
the
mails
were
being
used
to
send
in
bulk
materials.
so
the
mails
as
a
forum
is
just
another
way
of
trying
to
say
that
the
prison
is
in
part
a
public
forum,
which
it
is
decidedly
not.
second,
they
argue
that
these
materials...
these,
these
regulations
are
not
content-neutral.
well,
they
are
neutral
with
respect
to
the
question
of
the
opposition
or...
opposition
to
the
speaker's
viewpoint.
now,
that
is
the
way
in
which
neutrality
is
central
in
the,
in
the
non-public
forum
cases
such
as
perry.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
it
wasn't
raised
in
the
procunier--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
true.
the
non-public
forum
argument
was
not
made
in
procunier.
the
argument
that
was
made
in
procunier
by
the
state--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
i
don't...
it's,
it's,
it's
hard
to
say.
i
mean,
the,
the,
the
non-public
forum
cases
really
developed
after
procunier,
and
i
think
that
the
court
might
view
procunier,
or
counsel
arguing
that
case
might
view
it
quite
differently
now
than
they
did
at
the
time
when
they
did
not
really
have
that
line
of
cases
other
than
adderley
against
florida,
which
was
really
a
very
early
case
along
that
line.
and
finally,
the,
the
respondents
say
that
well,
this
case
is
not
really
a
closed,
non-public
forum
case
because
reading
is
not
harmful.
well,
that
begs
the
question.
reading
may
not
be
harmful,
but
what
we're
concerned
with
are
the
consequences
of
the
reading,
which
can
be
very
harmful
indeed.
thank
you.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
thank
you.
very
briefly,
there
are
some
publications
that
we
think
would
be
disposed
of
differently
under
the
two
standards,
at
least,
again,
the
standard
that
the
court
of
appeals
applied,
purportedly
applying
the
procunier
standard.
one
of
them
the
court
of
appeals
made
quite
clear
it
would
keep
out
was
the
the
call
magazine,
which
the
plaintiffs
nave
made
a
great
deal
of
in
their
brief.
this
was
a
magazine
in
which...
which
was
kept
out
of
marion
penitentiary
because
it
was
deemed
to
be
too
inflammatory,
basically,
and
to
be
a
magazine
which
would
be
likely
to
cause
disruption
within
the
penitentiary.
marion,
as
you
may
know
is
the
maximum,
maximum
security
institution.
the
people
who
are
incarcerated
in
marion
are
people
who
have
failed
to
adjust
to
other
institutions.
it
is
an
extremely
dangerous
place,
and
the
prospects
of
difficulties
in
marion
[inaudible].
mr.
william
c.
bryson
your
honor,
we
would
say
that,
we
might
well.
but
what,
what
we're
looking
at
is
the
standard
the
court
of
appeals
applied,
purporting
to
apply
procunier,
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
with
respect
to
call
that
it
was
insufficient
to
keep
that
magazine
out
simply
because
it
was
inflammatory
in
tone
because
it
contained
no
exhortation
for
group
activity.
and
let
me
read
you
a
selection
from
the
article
that
was
the
result,
that
was
the
reason
that
call
was
kept
out,
and
i
think
this
makes
the
case
very
well
for
why
the
exhortation
only
rule
that
the
court
of
appeals
applied
just
won't
work.
the
magazine
said
beatings
by
racist
guards
are
a
regular
occurrence
at
marion,
but
officials
have
not
been
able
to
crush
prisoner
resistance
or
halt
the
spread
of
revolutionary
ideas.
besides
the
lawsuit,
marlon
inmates
have
staged
strikes
and
fasts
and
have
continued
to
struggle
against
their
oppression.
well,
that
doesn't
contain
exhortation,
technically,
but
any
reader,
particularly
some
of
the
readers
who
are
perhaps
a
little
more
excitable
than
others
and
who
are
looking
for
opportunities
to
express
grievances
towards
the
prison
officials,
will
read
that,
i
submit,
as
a
form
of
implicit
exhortation,
to
continue
to
do
these
very
things
that
are
described.
similarly,
the
magazines
such
as
homosexual
explicit
materials
which
the
court
of
appeals
said
we
could
not
keep
out
on
the
basis
of
the
explanations
that
we
gave,
would
be
materials
that
we
would
want
to
keep
out
and
would
expect
to
keep
out
under
a
reasonableness
test.
with
respect
to
the
labyrinth,
which
was
the
publication
that
the
plaintiffs
rely
a
lot
on,
that
is,
the
publication
that
had
the
article
on
medical
murder
in
the
prison
system,
the
rejection,
the
reason
for
the
rejection
in
that
case
explains
a
lot
about
the
way
the
bop
engages
in
this
policy,
which
is
the
reason
it
was
kept
out
was
because,
as
testimony
at
trial
showed,
leavenworth,
which
is
the
place
from
which
it
was
kept
out,
was
very
tense
at
the
time.
it
would
probably
not
have
been
excluded
under
normal
times,
the
testimony
was,
but
a
number
of
prisoners
at
the
time
were
upset
over
the
rumors
of
these
so-called
murders,
and
there
was,
as
the
warden
testified,
some
real
tension
among
the
prisoners
over
the
issue.
it
was
a
very
sensitive
issue
at
the
time,
particularly
because
it
involved
an
inmate
who
had
been
there
at
leavenworth.
this
was
a,
if
you
will,
a
time,
place
and
manner
exclusion.
it
was
an
exclusion
by
the
warden
because
in
his
discretion
at
that
time
that
particular
article
would
have
been
potentially
very
disruptive.
that's
the
kind
of
discretion
that
the
bop
attempts
to
protect
and
the
kind
of
discretion
that
we
think
would
be
at
risk
if
a
standard
like
the
court
of
appeals
standard
were
adopted.
thank
you.
