mr.
steven
ney
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'm
here
today
representing
the
press.
this
is
a
case
involving
the
free
speech
rights
of
outsiders,
and
only
incidentally
a
prisoner
case.
i
represent
publishers
whose
publications
and
books
were
excluded
from
federal
prisons.
i'm
going
to
make
three
basic
points.
first
point
is
that
using
a
reasonableness
type
test,
the,
the
bureau
of
prisons
has
engaged
in
unjustified
censorship
of
otherwise
protected
material.
in
other
words,
the
standard
that
they
are
defending
in
this
court
is
essentially
one
of
reasonableness
compared
to
their
correspondence
policy,
and
it...
it
is
the
implementation
of
that
policy
that
has
led
to
unjustified
censorship.
my
second
point
is
that
martinez
must
control
the
decision
in
this
case.
both
of
those
cases
involved
the
content-based
censorship
of
individually
mailed
written
materials
from
outsiders,
and
to
that
extent,
those
two
cases
are
synonymous.
mr.
steven
ney
yes,
you're
right,
and
what--
mr.
steven
ney
--in
martinez?
mr.
steven
ney
yes,
those
were
correspondents,
and
this
court
in
that
case
discussed--
mr.
steven
ney
--the...
as
i
understand
the
rule
that
the
court
adopted
in
martinez,
it
applies
to
the
general
public
as
this
court
described
it
in
turner,
the
general
public
writing
to
prisoners.
the
court
certainly
discussed
the
importance
of
a
familial
relationship,
but
the
rule
established
in
that
case
applied
to
all
correspondence
sent
to
prisoners.
mr.
steven
ney
well,
the
materials
that
are
sent
here
are
sent,
in
some
cases,
by
publishers
who
are
focusing
on
a
prison-oriented
audience.
in
other
cases
they
are
publications
of
general
circulation.
mr.
steven
ney
the...
as
i
understand
the
rule--
mr.
steven
ney
--in
each
instance
here
we
have
a
subscription,
a
request
from
the
inmate
to
the
publisher
seeking
a
nexus,
seeking
an
act
of
communication,
seeking
to
establish
a
link,
and
the
publisher
is
responding
in
an
individualized
way
saying
yes,
i
accept
your
request,
i'm
sending
the
publication.
mr.
steven
ney
i
think
it
depends
on
the
type
of
material
that
we're
talking
about.
it
covers
a
variety.
some
of
the
material
that
has
been
censored
in
this
case,
for
example,
the
win
magazine,
was
an
article
that
criticized
prison
industries,
and
it
was
censored
from
leavenworth
prison.
mr.
steven
ney
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
the
question.
mr.
steven
ney
yes.
mr.
steven
ney
yes,
certainly
it's
the
latter.
mr.
steven
ney
the
result
of
the
bureau's
policy
is
that
a
magazine
like
the
labyrinth,
which
criticized
medical
care
at
leavenworth
and
in
other
federal
prisons,
was
rejected.
they
stated
that
it
could
cause
problems
with...
the
philosophy
might
guide
inmates
into
situations
that
would
cause
them
problems
with
the
medical
staff,
that
the
article
was
slanted.
the
article
said
that
prisoners
had
been
murdered
by
neglect.
the...
later
on
in
depositions
in
this
case,
the
officials
acknowledged
that
this
publication
was
not
a
threat
to
security
and
that
they
would
let
it
in,
although
the
government
never
took
the
legal
position
in
this
case,
as
they
seem
to
be
saying
today,
that
those
publications
could
come
in.
it
was
only
as
a
result
of
the,
the,
the
bringing
of
this
lawsuit
that
that
unjustified
censorship
came
to
light.
the,
the...
another
magazine
that
was
kept
out
was
the
call
magazine,
criticized
the
control
unit
at
the
marion
prison.
mr.
steven
ney
i
don't
know
what
they'll
say.
mr.
steven
ney
yes.
mr.
steven
ney
i
think
you're
right,
and--
mr.
steven
ney
--no,
i
think
what
our
point
is,
is
that
the...
this
general
framework
established
by
the
bureau
of
prisons
is
virtually
identical
to
the
one
that
this
court
condemned
in
the
martinez
case.
it
allowed
the
warden
virtually
untrammeled
discretion
to
keep
out
whatever
he
felt
was
inflammatory
material.
and
this
court
said
that
notwithstanding
that
belief,
that
narrowly
drawn
guidelines
were
necessary,
and
that's
the
same
position
that
he
would
take
in
this
case.
mr.
steven
ney
no,
this
is...
we
are
arguing
this
case
principally
as
a
first
amendment
case
of
the
outsiders,
the
freedom
of
the
press,
the
press'
right
to
have
at
least
the
equal
access
to
a
willing
listener
that
a
member
of
the
general
public
would
have.
mr.
steven
ney
as
i
understand
the
bureau
of
prisons'
policies
is
that
they
do
allow
prisons
and
they
do
not
regulate
the
media.
i
don't...
i'm--
mr.
steven
ney
--i
don't
think
the
court
has
to
answer
that
or
reach
that
question
today.
mr.
steven
ney
well,
i
think
it's
a
difficult
question,
and
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
different
forms
of
media
are
governed
by
different
principles.
mr.
steven
ney
well,
i
think
this
court's
decisions
indicate
that
the...
that
from
the
outsider's
perspective,
that
a...
that
a
publisher
has
a
right
to
reach
an
audience,
to
engage
in
that
kind
of
act
of
communication.
mr.
steven
ney
yes.
and
what
is
the
distinction,
from
our
perspective,
between
the...
a
member
of
the
general
public,
anyone
can
write,
anyone
in
this
court
could
write
to
any
prisoner
in
the
united
states,
and
we're
saying
that
same
right
should
exist
for
a
publisher.
mr.
steven
ney
well,
i
think
one
the
things
to
look
at
is
how
has
the
martinez
rule
worked
in
the
past
14
years,
and
it's
our
position
that
it
has
worked
well
in
the
correspondence
area.
there
have
been
no
great
outcries
that
it
has
led
to
the
introduction
of
inflammatory
material.
mr.
steven
ney
we
would,
as
we
said
in
our
brief,
we
could...
certainly
publications
that
would
instruct
in
how
to
escape
from
prison
or
how
to
pick
a
lock,
how
to
make
bombs
or
weapons.
we
have
no
objection
to
censorship
of
those
kinds
of
materials,
and
the
martinez
standard
would
certainly
allow
that
exclusion.
i
think
it's
ironic
that
the...
and
it
shows
up
the
lack
of
an
appropriate
distinction,
an
unworkable
distinction
between
publications
and
correspondence,
the
fact
that
you
could
send
in,
a
lot
of
the
materials
that
were
censored
in
this
case
could
be
transmitted
by
letter
under
the
bureau
of
prisons'
own
policies
that,
and
the...
if
we
adopt
the
solicitor's
suggestion
that
there
be
a
different
standard,
then
if
i
summarize
an
article
in
a
letter,
i
could
get
it
into
the
prison,
or
if
i
even
copy
an
editorial,
of
if
i
enclose
a
news
clipping,
then
my
letter
could
get
in
but
the
news
clipping
would
be
kept
out.
i
think
it's
an
unworkable
distinction
and
one
that
this
court
should
not
adopt.
mr.
steven
ney
well,
i
think
that's
what
this
court
said
in
the
jones
case,
that
the
bulk
mailings
could
be
kept
out
but
that
individual
mailings--
mr.
steven
ney
--yes,
okay.
mr.
steven
ney
well,
this
case
does
not
involve
distribution.
we
see
that
as
a
separate
question.
mr.
steven
ney
no,
i...
but
that's
not
this
case.
this
is
a
case
involving
individual
subscriptions,
as
i
see
it,
individual
acts
of
communication.
mr.
steven
ney
not
on
a
bulk
basis,
no.
i
think
the
jones
case
would
dispose
of
that.
mr.
steven
ney
the...
i
think
part
of
the
importance
of
the
standard
chosen
by
the
court
is
the
signal
that
it
will
send
to
prison
officials,
that
it...
this
is
a
standard
that
ten
circuit
courts
of
appeals
have
used.
mr.
steven
ney
well,
i
think
that
the
question
perhaps
should
be
put
to
the
solicitor.
we
have
been
trying
to
get
a,
a
statement
from
them
as
to
what
of
the
46
publications
they
would
allow
in,
and
we
have
never
been
able
to
get
it.
so
i
don't
know
what
the
difference
would
be.
we
think
if--
mr.
steven
ney
--that's
right.
we
think
that
if
that's
the
standard
the
court
adopts
and
it's
remanded
for
fact
findings,
as
the
solicitor
has
agreed
should
be
done,
that
we
would
prevail
under...
under
either
standard.
mr.
steven
ney
well,
i
think
symbols...
i
don't
think
it
is
totally
symbolic,
but
i
think
symbols
are
very
significant
because
i
think
it
would
be
an
invitation
to
prison
administrators
to
engage
in
much
more
censorship
than
they
are
presently
doing,
and
i
think
that
will
lead
to...
let's,
let...
right
now
they
censor,
according
to
their
brief,
170c
publications
in
the
past
year.
that
may
lead
to
thousands
of
more
being
kept
out
under
this
vague
standard,
and
will
lead
to
more
litigation
in
this,
in
lower
courts
and
in
this
court.
the
solicitor
has
made
the
point
that
the
interest
of
the
correspondent
is
less
than
the
interest
of
the
publisher,
and
what
we
think
the
first
amendment
protects
is
the
act
of
communication.
as
this
court
said
in
the
martinez
case,
it
takes
a
listener
and
a
speaker
in
order
to
have
an
act
of
communication,
and
this
court
acknowledged
that
in
the
virginia
board
of
pharmacy
case.
it's
a
constitutionally
protected
relationship
that
the
first
amendment
protects.
we
are
not
seeking
any
special
access
as
this
court
denied
in
the
peli
case
or
in
the
koed
case.
we
are
seeking
equal
access
for
the
press
to
the
prisons,
just
as
this
court
acknowledged
in
the
richmond
newspaper's
case,
that
the
press
would
have
equal
access.
we
would
also
indicate
that
the...
believe
that
the
test
set
up
in
martinez
is
not
an
insurmountable
one.
several
circuit
courts
of
appeals
have
upheld
prison
regulations
when
they
have
been
challenged.
it
does
not
require
the
compilation
of
a
dossier
on
the
eve
of
a
riot
or
predicting
with
certainty.
it
allows
a
degree
of
latitude
for
a
prison
official.
and
of
course,
it
does
allow
a
prior
restraint,
which
is
exceptional
but
recognizes
the
uniqueness
of
that
forum.
i
think
it's
also
important
to
point
out
that
there
really
is
no
danger
in
this
case
that's
any
greater
than
the
dangers
that
were
posed
in
the
martinez
case.
the
government
has
talked
about
prison
violence.
there
certainly
is
prison
violence
but
they
have
never
linked
any
particular
publication
to
any
particular
act
of
violence.
the...
publication
after
publication
that
was
rejected,
we
showed
them
to
prison
officials
in
depositions
and
at
trial,
and
they
acknowledged
that
they
were
not
dangerous
to
security.
how
can
these
publications
that
they
kept
out
be
considered
dangerous
when
they
now
say
that
they
can
let
them
in?
i
would
also
take
issue
with
the
solicitor
general's
statement
that
the
policies...
that
the
reason
these
admissions
have
been
made
resulted
because
of
the
change
in
policy.
in
fact,
the
general
policy
which
allowed...
allows
a
warden
wide
discretion,
and
his
staff,
is
the
same
as
it
was
in
1979.
mr.
steven
ney
it
varies--
mr.
steven
ney
--it
varies
widely.
some
of
them
are
prison--
mr.
steven
ney
--it's
not
a
big
market,
and
some
of
the
publishers
do
distribute
their
publications
for
free,
although
on
a
subscription
basis,
to
prisoners.
there
also
are
the...
there
are
different
categories
of
publications.
some
are
political,
some
are
of
a
hetero-or
homosexual
nature,
and
it
depends.
many
publishers
do
request
subscriptions
and
do
request
payment.
some
offer
discounts.
it
varies.
mr.
steven
ney
yes.
mr.
steven
ney
we've
given
excerpts
of
some
of
them
in
the
joint
lodging
which
is
available
to
the
court.
many
of
them...
the
ones
that
seem
to
have
stimulated
most
of
the
censorship
are
the
ones
that
are
geared
towards
prison
conditions
and
that
are
critical
of
the
prison,
critical
of
the
prison
administrators.
as
one
warden
explained
in
his
deposition,
he
said,
well,
the
people
in
the
mailroom
have
to
read
something,
so
it
seems
they
either
lock
at
the
political
magazines
or
they
look
at
the
sexual
magazines,
and
i
think
it
really
depends
on
the
whims
of
the
particular
institution
and
the
persons
there.
we've
also
challenged
the
all-or-nothing
rule
in
this
case
which
allows
the
prison
official
to
exclude
the
entire
magazine,
even
if
only
a
single
paragraph
or
single
page
is
objectionable
and
we
believe
that
that
would
fail
afoul
either
of
the
reasonableness
test
or
the
martinez
test.
the
prison
officials
acknowledged
that
they
had
no
security
basis
for
throwing
out
the
entire
magazine
and
that
there
would
not
be
a...
any
security
risk
posed
by
deleting
the
offending
portion
of
the
publication
and
allowing
the
rest
to
be
given
to
the
prisoner.
we
think
that's
a
clear
example
of
an
overbroad
policy
that
does
not
show
sufficient
respect
for
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
outsiders.
mr.
steven
ney
the
bureau
of
prisons,
when
this
litigation
began,
had
an
excluded
list.
mr.
steven
ney
and
they
eliminated
it
partly
as
a
result
of
this
litigation.
the
all-or-nothing
rule
works--
mr.
steven
ney
--right,
or
a
book.
mr.
steven
ney
if
there's
one
page
objectionable,
the
entire
book
is
kept
out.
and
other
prison
systems
around
the
country
have
used
an
item-by-item
censorship
without
any
great
problems.
i
think
it's,
it's
important
to
recognize
that
the
broad
standard
that
the
bureau
has
adopted
allowing
this
wide
discretion
really
allows
for
the
exercise
of
unprofessional
judgments,
personal
judgments,
personal
distaste
by
the
prison
officials,
and
that's
what
the
record
in
this
case
shows.
and
we
feel
that's
where
the
standard
could
make
a
difference,
justice
stevens.
i
think
it
will
give
a
signal
that
the
same
protection
that
is
given
to
correspondence
must
be
given
to
books
and
publications
coming
into
prisons.
we
think
that
the
standard
adopted
by
the
d.c.
circuit
is
a...
is
consistent
with
martinez.
the,
the
circuit
court
said
that
the
prison
official
would
have
to
make
a
reasoned
determination
that
material
encourages
conduct
which
would
constitute
or
otherwise
was
likely
to
produce
a
breach
of
security.
that's
not
much
different
than
the
standard
even
used
in
the
jones
case
in
this
court
for
non-prison
related
where
the
question
was
did
it
possess
a
likelihood
of
disruption
to
prison
security,
order
or
stability.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
