justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bryson,
when
you
say
the
district
court
upheld
the
regulations,
it
upheld
the
prior
regulations
or
the
current
regulations?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
were
already
in
effect
by
the
time
the
district
court--
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
might
add
that
that
was
the
way
it
was
written,
too;
i
mean,
in
addition
to
saying
that
it's
possible
to
read
it
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bryson,
of
all
the
things
you
mention,
the
one
that
troubles
me
most
is
your
statement
that
you
keep
out
publications
that
advocate
unionism.
do
you
keep
out
publications
that
advocate
better
food--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
prisons?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
didn't
say
that
about
the
unionism
exclusion.
is
it...
is
it
only
the
manner
in
which
it's
proposed
that,
that
induces
you
to
keep
it
out?
what
if
you
just
say,
you
know,
you
should
try
to
persuade
prison
authorities
to
allow
unions?
would
you
keep
that
out?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
ney,
is
it...
is
it
an
essential
part
of
your
position
that
a
person
in
prison
retains
not
only
the
right
to
receive
letters
from
individuals
who
are
writing
him,
but
also
the
right
of
access
to
the
mass
media?
isn't
that
essentially
what
you're
arguing?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about,
what
about
the
electronic
media?
suppose
you,
you
have
a
prisoner
who
has
enough
money
to
buy
a
television
set;
he's
willing
to
invest
his
own
money
for
a
television
set.
there
are
no
prison
problems
with
the
set;
it
doesn't
disrupt
the
activities
in
the
prison.
does
he
have
a
right
to
have
television
in
prison?
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
ask--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
when,
when
they
are
more
disruptive
but
i'm
positing
that
you
can
prove
that
a
television
set
is
not...
in
other
words,
it
seems
to
me
that
part
of...
there's
a
lot
of
inconvenience
in
being
on
prison,
and
the
inconvenience
does
not
consist
exclusively
of
having
your,
your
mobility
restrained.
there,
there
are
just
some
things
that
that
traditionally
you
don't
have
in
prison,
and
one
of
them,
it
seems
to
me,
is
a
television
set.
i'm
not
sure
that
one
of
them
isn't
time
magazine
or
general,
general
access
to
whatever
publications
you
want
to
subscribe
to.
can,
can
you
distinguish
the,
the,
the
print
and
the
electronic
media
that
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sure
an
individual
writer
does.
we've,
we've
said
that
in
procunier.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
the
distinction
is
what
have
the
traditions
of
our
society
been
as
to
the
inconveniences
that
prison
entails.
one
of
them
has
not
been
that
your
family,
friends,
people
who
want
to
write
to
you
individually,
can't
do
so,
but
one
of
them
may
be
that
you
can't
have
television
sets
and
you
can't
necessarily
subscribe
to
time
magazine.
