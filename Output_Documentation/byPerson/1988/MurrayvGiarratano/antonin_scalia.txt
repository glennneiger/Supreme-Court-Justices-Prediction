justice
scalia
mr.
harris,
i
do
not
understand
what
you
have
been
telling
us
about
all
you
have
to
do
is
file
a
paper
with
the
district
judge
in
virginia,
saying
i
want
counsel.
and
then
it
is
within
his
discretion
to
grant
counsel
or
not?
justice
scalia
when
that
paper
is
filed,
he
does
not
know
anything?
justice
scalia
on
what
basis
does
he
exercise
his
discretion?
i
like
the
fellow's
name,
i
do
not
like
the
fellow's
name?
what
does
your
office
do
when
it
goes
in
to
urge
that
the
motion
for
counsel
be
granted
or
not
granted?
all
he
knows
is
the
person's
name,
and
that
he
is
on
death
row,
i
suppose.
justice
scalia
i
see,
the
judge
who
conducted
the
trial.
justice
scalia
to
have
counsel
appointed?
justice
scalia
so
long
as
he
files?
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
why
are
the
last
15
days
critical?
i
mean,
i
would
assume
that
if
there
has
been
a
mistake
in
your
conviction,
you
want
to
get
that
before
the
courts
as
soon
as
possible.
justice
scalia
i
mean,
i
am
sure
that
every
day
is
more
important
as
it
gets
closer
and
closer,
but
i
do
not
see
why,
legally,
it
is
more
critical.
justice
scalia
but
it
should
have
been
filed.
i
mean,
the
critical
time
is
the
time
before
that
15
days.
justice
scalia
just
because
then
are
housed
in
a
separate
part
of
the
facility
during
the
15
days
before
the
date
of
execution?
justice
scalia
what
is
the
average
space
between
the
date
of
conviction
and
the
date
of
execution?
do
you
have
any
idea
what
the
average
is?
justice
scalia
six
months?
justice
scalia
of
course,
we
have
never
said
that
he
had
to
be
given
counsel,
have
we?
we
said
that
he
had
to
be
given
access.
justice
scalia
what
was
the
error
that
was
confessed?
that
was
evans'
case?
justice
scalia
the
merits
error,
or
what?
justice
scalia
oh,
so
it
went
to
the
sentencing?
justice
scalia
let
me
ask
you...
i
meant
to
ask
you
earlier,
when
somebody
on
the
other
side
made
the
objection
that
you
will
have
a
challenge
to
whether
the
counsel
you
had
was
adequate.
what
is
your
response
to
that...
to
an
endless
series
of
yes,
you
gave
me
access,
but
with
counsel
that
was
not
really
good
enough
counsel,
and
therefore
i
did
not
have
access,
and
therefore
i
am
entitled
to
do
it
all
over
again?
justice
scalia
what
does
it
result
in,
then?
justice
scalia
yes,
except
that
the
basis
for
that
bounds
claim
would
then
be
the
inadequacy
of
his
counsel,
right?
justice
scalia
well,
i
do
not
understand
that.
wait
a
minute.
you--
justice
scalia
--could
you
give
him
ineffective
counsel,
and
you
think
that
would
be
adequate?
justice
scalia
maybe
you
do
not
need
counsel
at
all,
then.
justice
scalia
but
not
necessarily
competent
counsel?
justice
scalia
but
it
is
enough
if
he
is
incompetent?
justice
scalia
but
incompetent
counsel
does
not
have
to
be
counsel.
you
can
have
competent
non-counsel
who
is
incompetent
counsel.
justice
scalia
but
nonetheless,
after
the
habeas
proceeding
is
completed--
justice
scalia
--with
counsel
that
has
been
provided
somehow,
there
would
still
be
a
claim
remaining
that
that
proceeding
was
itself
inadequate
because
you
would
not
call
it
ineffectiveness
of
counsel,
you
would
call
it--
justice
scalia
--lack
of
access.
justice
scalia
but
you
would
not
need
counsel
for
that
last
proceeding?
that
would
really
be
the
last
one.
or
would
you
need
counsel
for
that
one,
too?
