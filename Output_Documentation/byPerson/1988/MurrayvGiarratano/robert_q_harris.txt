mr.
robert
q.
harris
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
two
years
ago
in
the
case
of
pennsylvania
versus
finley,
this
court
said
that
there
is
no
constitutional
obligation
on
the
states
to
provide
counsel
for
state
prisoners
in
state
collateral
attacks
on
state
court
judgments.
since
1983,
in
barefoot
v.
estelle,
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
the
rules
for
collateral
review
of
presumptively
valid
final
judgments
do
not
change
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
sentence.
the
decision
of
the
court
below,
the
fourth
circuit,
is
flatly
inconsistent
with
these
decisions
of
this
court.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
to
affirm
the
judgement
of
the
fourth
circuit
and
in
the
process
undermine
or
overrule
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
i
will
briefly
address
some
of
the
facts
in
this
case,
and
then
explain
why
we
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
decision
below.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
are
inmates
under
sentence
of
death.
they
have
been
tried
and
convicted
of
capital
crimes
in
the
state
courts.
their
convictions
have
been
upheld
on
a
mandatory
appeal
to
the
virginia
supreme
court,
a
mandatory
appeal
that
also
includes
a
statutory
requirement
of
sentence
review.
they
of
course
had
counsel
for
trial,
and
on
their
mandatory
appeal.
the
focus
here--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--your
honor,
i
am
pointing
out
that
virginia
meets
the
constitutional
requirements
of
counsel
for
the
trials
and
direct
appeals
to
the
virginia
supreme
court.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
no,
sir,
it
is
not
that
argument
at
all.
we
think
that
we
exceed
many
of
the
constitutional
requirements
in
the
process
of
the
trial
and
the
direct
appeal,
particularly
in
the
sense
that
in
a
virginia
direct
appeal,
the
supreme
court
is
obligated
to
conduct
that
separate
inquiry
on
the
proportionality
of
the
sentence,
and
the
excessiveness
of
the
sentence,
to
decide
whether
that
sentence
is
appropriate
even
on
direct
appeal.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
we
try
to
be
in
some
respects,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
the
virginia
supreme
court
reviews
the
record
on
the
errors
of
trial
that
are
raised.
the
virginia
supreme
court
conducts
review
of
the
entire
record
on
the
independent
inquiry
on
the
propriety
of
the
sentence.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
it
will
review
the
errors
that
are
raised
by
counsel.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
the
focus
in
this
case
is
not
on
the
trial--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--as
i
understand
it,
practically
every
state
has
a
rule
isolating
review
to
those
claims
that
are
raised
by
the
parties.
virginia
has
a
rule
that
requires
counsel
to
object
at
trial
and
to
assign
his
errors
on
appeal,
and
those
are
the
claims
that
the
court
will
address
on
direct
appeal.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
not
in
a
capital
case,
at
all.
it
is
a
mandatory,
direct
appeal
as
a
matter
of
right.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
in
other
cases,
there
is
an
appeal
to
an
intermediary
court.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
yes,
your
honor,
within
the
last
few
years.
but
again,
the
focus
here
is
not
on
the
direct
appeals,
and
those
procedures
are
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
we
are
looking
at
post-conviction
proceedings.
we
are
talking
about
proceedings
that
can
only
occur
after
a
trial
and
after
a
complete
appeal
to
the
virginia
supreme
court.
for
those
proceedings
in
virginia,
every
one
of
virginia's
death
row
inmates
has
in
fact
had
counsel
to
prepare,
file,
and
present
his
petition
to
the
state
courts.
no
virginia
inmate
has
filed
a
pro
se
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
state
courts.
now,
virginia
does
not
automatically
grant
them
a
right
to
counsel
for
their
state
habeas
corpus
actions.
the
state
courts
have
the
discretion
to
appoint
counsel
upon
request
for
these
inmates
who
wish
to
pursue
collateral
remedies.
virginia
provides,
by
state
law,
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
raise
claims
of
constitutional
deprivation
associated
with
the
trial.
we
do
not
require
the
automatic
appointment
of
counsel
from
the
beginning,
but
in
any
habeas
case
in
virginia
where
a
petition
is
presented
that
raises
a
non-frivolous
claim
with
a
factual
issue,
virginia
law
is
that
the
court
must
at
that
point
appoint
counsel
to
represent
that
inmate
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
in
all
habeas
cases.
if
you
raise
a
non-frivolous
claim
that
would
require
hearing,
the
virginia
supreme
court
has
required
for
over
20
years
that
the
trial
court
must
appoint
counsel
at
that
point.
but
the
trial
courts
always
have
the
discretion
to
appoint
counsel
at
any
stage
of
the
habeas
proceeding.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
the
trial
court,
and
it
is
very
similar
to
the
summary
judgement
inquiry
in
the
federal
courts.
we
are
talking
about
a
claim
that
would
say
the
legal
claim
for
relief,
and
looking
at
whether
or
not
the
facts
in
support
of
that
claim
are
in
dispute.
again,
the
record
in
this
case
will
show
that
that
discretion
of
virginia's
trial
courts
has
been
exercised
on
behalf
of
death
row
inmates.
death
row
inmates
have,
by
some
means,
communicated
to
a
trial
court
their
desire
to
file
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
and
virginia
trial
courts
have
agreed
to
appoint
counsel
and
in
fact
have
issued
orders
appointing
counsel
to
prepare
and
present
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
virginia.
few
inmates,
very
few
inmates,
have
asked.
the
inmates
in
virginia
have
relied
on
a
privately
set
up
system
of
volunteer
attorneys.
since
1983,
there
has
been
an
organization
that
has
been
set
up
to
recruit
volunteer
attorneys
to
represent
these
inmates
in
their
habeas
corpus
actions.
they
have
been
successful,
but
they
became
fearful
that
that
system
was
in
danger
of
collapsing,
and
as
a
result,
they
turned
to
the
district
court
to
compel
virginia
to
perpetuate
their
preferred
system
of
getting
legal
assistance.
the
district
court
ordered
virginia
to
do
this,
and
premised
this
right
to
counsel
on
the
right
of
access
to
the
courts.
our
position
is
the
right
of
access
to
the
court
in
post-conviction
proceedings
does
not
include
a
right
to
counsel.
it
is
an
entirely
separate
matter,
and
we
know
that
from
this
court's
prior
decisions.
this
court
has
never
suggested--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--i
am
sorry,
i
do
not
think
that
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
i
would
say
that
it
would
not
make
any
difference
for
this
issue.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
because
we
say
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
counsel.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
consistent
with
the
requirements
that
the
constitution
does
impose,
of
giving
them
some
means
of
legal
assistance
to
present
their
claims.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
and
in
the
matter
of
what
this
court
has
required
as
some
form
of
legal
assistance,
that
comes
under
the
right
of
access
to
the
courts.
this
court
has
said
that
the
states
are
obligated
to
provide
some
form
of
legal
assistance
to
inmates
so
that
they
can
have
an
opportunity
to
present
their
claims,
to
get
into
court
with
their
claims,
and
to
get
their
claims
before
a
court.
in
virginia,
if
it
is
a
colorable
claim,
a
claim
of
some
substance,
they
will
have
counsel
to
present
it.
there
is
no
possibility
of
an
inmate
litigating
a
claim
himself
in
virginia.
it
will
not
happen.
as
far
as
having
legal
assistance
to
get
his
claims
together,
to
put
them
in
that
package
and
present
it
to
the
appropriate
court,
virginia
provides
a
wide
variety
of
resources.
bounds
talks
in
terms
of
a
law
library
or
a
form
of
legal
assistance
to
get
into
court.
virginia
gives
these
inmates
law
libraries
at
the
institutions.
virginia
gives
these
inmates
a
system
of
legal
assistance
in
the
institutions.
lawyer
assistance...
lawyers
are
appointed
for
each
of
the
institutions
where
these
inmates
could
possibly
be,
to
counsel
and
assist,
to
help
them
under
the
instructions
that
they
have
had
now
since--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--virginia
has
chosen
to
give
these
inmates
more
than
what
the
law
requires.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
if
bounds
means
what
bounds
says,
yes.
we
have
chosen
to
go
beyond.
we
have
chosen
to
give
them
law
libraries,
we
have
chosen
to
give
them
legal
assistance.
there
is
a
method
to
have
court-appointed
counsel
for
individual
representation
for
each
one
of
these
inmates.
often--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
that
is
correct.
and
we
give
them
both.
we
give
them
beyond
that
a
real
opportunity
to
have
independent
counsel
appointed
to
represent
them.
now,
nothing
in
bounds,
nothing
in
the
cases
before
bounds,
johnson
v.
avery,
ross
v.
moffitt,
ever
suggests
that
there
was
a
right
to
counsel
and
a
right
of
access.
two
years
ago,
in
the
pennsylvania
v.
finley
case,
this
court
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
constitution
does
not
require
states
in
their
own
proceedings,
collateral
proceedings
to
their
criminal
cases,
to
provide
counsel
for
the
inmates
in
those
proceedings.
the
distinction
here--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--it
was
not,
your
honor.
the
distinction
here
is
not
the
sentence,
the
distinction
here
is
the
nature
of
the
proceedings.
they
are
collateral.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
this
court
has
refused
to
create
special
rules
in
post-conviction
proceedings.
i
think
i
agree,
this
court
has
on
many
occasions
said
death
is
different,
and
each
time,
this
court
was
looking
at
the
trial,
and
the
sentencing
process
at
the
time
of
trial.
as
far
as--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--i
do
not
think
that
is
correct.
i
will
point
out
that
in
the--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--in
the
plaintiffs'
briefs
submitted
to
this
court,
it
is
indicated
that,
i
believe,
18
states
have
a
method
of
providing
automatic
appointment
of
counsel
in
all
habeas
cases.
we
are
not
talking
about
capital
cases,
but
in
all
habeas
cases.
in
many
of
those,
at
least
six
of
those,
it
is
after
something
has
been
filed
that
counsel
is
automatically
appointed.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
that
is
correct.
several
of
them
require
the
prior
filing
of
a
petition,
and
then
there
will
be
automatic
appointment
of
counsel.
in
many
respects,
that
is
what
we
have
already
available
in
virginia.
with
the
legal
assistance
available
to
the
inmate
at
the
institution,
he
can
file
a
petition
raising
some
colorable
claim.
he
is
never
locked
into
that
petition.
virginia
has
a
policy
of
liberal
amendment
of
its
petitions
to
allow
inmates,
if
they
have
the
initial
petition
with
a
colorable
claim,
if
the
court
appoints
counsel
to
represent
them...
they
can
do
further
inquiry
and
at
that
time
develop
their
claims
further.
they
are
not
frozen
in
time
to
that
initial
document
that
they
present
to
the
state
courts.
the
courts
below
attempted
to
distinguish
finley
because
it
was
a
death
case.
it
was
not
a
death
case.
but
i
think
the
issue
is
closed,
that
the
constitution
does
not...
this
court
has
made
it
clear...
the
constitution
does
not
require
a
separate
set
of
procedural
standards
or
procedural
review
for
capital
cases.
this
choice
has
made
the
decision
to
focus
on
the
trial,
to
focus
on
the
sentencing.
that
is
where
the
determination
is
made
that
these
inmates
are
going
to
be
convicted.
that
is
where
the
decisions
are
made
of
guilt
and
innocence.
that
is
where
the
decision
of
sentence
is
made.
this
court
has
focused
on
that
forum.
that
is
the
forum
our
legal
system
has
created
for
deciding
these
issues.
this
court
has
not
decided
to
require
additional
proceedings
to
constantly
review
these
matters.
the
courts
below
ignored
the
rulings
of
this
court,
and
created
a
new
constitutional
right.
the
procedures
that
are
in
place
in
virginia
are
severely
underutilized.
they
have
never
been
used
by
these
inmates.
they
have
instead
preferred
to
rely
on
an
alternative
way
of
getting
counsel.
the
district
court
has
created
a
new
right
to
counsel
to
solve
a
problem
that
has
not
been
shown
to
exist.
these
inmates
have
all
had
counsel.
no
inmate
has
filed
a
pro
se
petition.
but
there
is
a
problem
if
a
constitutional
right
is
created.
the
difficulty
that
we
see
with
a
constitutional
right
in
habeas
corpus
proceedings
is
that
we
are
inviting
another
complete
round
of
litigation
challenging
final
judgments,
presumptively
final
judgments,
presumptively
valid
final
judgments,
of
the
state
courts.
we
are
inviting
inquiries
into
the
competence
of
habeas
counsel.
we
are
inviting
another
separate
proceeding
on
an
issue
that
is
wholly
collateral
to
the
sentence
itself.
rather
than
discard
this
prior
court's
decisions,
and
rather
than
seek
to
create
a
new
right
to
counsel,
we
would
ask
this
court
to
reaffirm
its
prior
decisions.
we
would
ask
this
court
to
reaffirm
the
principles
of
comity,
of
recognizing
the
interests
of
the
states
in
its
own
proceedings,
and
the
interest
of
finality
in
recognizing
that
presumptively
valid
judgments
are
entitled
to
that
respect.
and
we
would
ask
this
court
to
reaffirm
those
prior
principles
and
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
there
may
be
some
incidental
shortening
of
the
time
at
that
very
initial
stage
if
the
inmate
were
to
make
a
request
for
counsel.
the
problem
is,
the
inmate
has
no
incentive,
other
than
the
fact
that
we
might
set
an
execution
date
if
he
does
not
file.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
it
is
quite
an
incentive,
and
it
is
one
that
we
prefer
not
to
do
hastily.
in
the
past,
when
a
volunteer
attorney
has
been
contacted,
or
when
we
talk
to
any
attorney
who
has
indicated
that
he
was
representing
these
attorneys,
all
we
have
done
is
to
find
out,
do
you
intend
to
file
promptly?
and
if
he
says
he
does,
we
do
not
rush
out
and
set
an
execution
date.
if
he
files
promptly,
it
will
be
handled
in
the
usual--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--well,
again,
we
think
we
may
in
fact
have
a
system
that
allows
for
prompt
and
automatic
appointment,
if
the
inmate
simply
asks
the
circuit
court
to
appoint
counsel.
the
circuit
court
has
the
discretion.
we
have
represented
in
the
record
in
this
case,
we
are
willing...
the
office
of
the
attorney
general
is
willing...
to
join
in
such
requests.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
all
i
am
talking
about
is
filing
a
motion
for
appointment
of
counsel,
a
one-page
document
that
says,
"get
me
a
lawyer".
mr.
robert
q.
harris
we
have
said,
the
trial
court
has
the
discretion
to
do
that
very
thing.
and
we
have
lawyers
in
the
institutions
who
are
certainly
capable
of
drafting
a
motion
for
appointment
of
counsel
to
get
these
inmates
into
court.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
there
is
no
guarantee
that
the
trial
court
will
do
it
in
every
instance.
i
would
suggest
that
it
is--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--i
don't
know
the
court
needs
to
look
at
that
issue
for
one
particular
reason.
the
evidence
in
the
record
in
this
case
was
that
the
plaintiff's
expert
was
unaware
of
any
inmate
who
had
ever
litigated
a
habeas
corpus
petition
pro
se
in
a
death
case.
there
is
not
this
nationwide
crisis
of
pro
se
inmates
litigating
death
sentences.
the
expert
testimony
in
this
case
was
that
everyone
had
had
a
lawyer,
and
we
note
from
the
record
in
this
case
that
everyone
in
virginia--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
existing
rule
is
that
there
is
no
right
to
counsel,
so
i
would
ask
that
that
rule
be
retained.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
that
is
one
of
the
means
of
obtaining
it.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
the
motion
would
be
filed,
in
all
instances,
with
the
judge
who
is
the
presiding
judge
at
trial.
we
are
talking
about
a
judge
who
has
heard
of
this
inmate
before,
in
other
words.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
it
would
be
the
very
same
judge
who
tried
the
case.
what
we
have
said
is
that
if
that
inmate
makes
it
known
to
the
trial
court
that
he
is
interested
in
pursuing
habeas
corpus
relief,
and
that
he
would
like
to
have
the
appointment
of
counsel
to
represent
him
and
to
help
him
file
his
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
that
we
have,
for
our
own
reasons,
as
you
have
indicated,
expediting
this
matter
in
some
way,
we
will
join
in
that
motion,
and
get
the
matter
going.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
it
is
more
convenient
for
us
to
deal
with
a
lawyer
representing
an
inmate
in
a
death
case
than
it
is
a
pro
se
inmate.
and
it
is
certainly
going
to
be
more
convenient
for
the
court
considering
the
case.
and
it
is
for
those
reasons
we
expect
that
the
trial
courts
will
in
fact
grant
these
motions.
i
agree,
it
is
discretionary.
we
cannot
guarantee
the
courts
could
do
it
in
every
case.
but
we
can
guarantee
that
that
inmate
will
have
available
to
him,
at
the
institution,
assistance
to
get
into
court
and
ask.
and
we
can
also
guarantee
that
if
that
court
should,
for
whatever
reason,
decline
to
grant
him
that
discretionary
appointment
of
counsel,
that
he
still
has
available
to
him
back
at
that
institution
legal
assistance
in
excess
of
what
bounds
requires
to
file
a
petition
raising
claims.
presumably,
if
he
has
a
valid
claim...
we
cannot
guarantee
he
is
going
to
have
a
valid
constitutional
claim...
our
system
is
geared
to
make
certain
that
he
doesn't.
but
if
he
has
a
valid
claim,
it
will
be
heard.
if
he
has
a
claim
that
would
require
any
kind
of
hearing,
he
will
have
counsel.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
there
is
no
cap
on
their
compensation.
they
are
compensated
in
the
amount
deemed
reasonable
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
that
is
my
understanding.
from
the
testimony
in
this
case,
ordinarily
vouchers
would
be
submitted
indicating
the
time
that
they
spent,
and
then
the
court
would
allow
a
fee
for
that
time.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
we
only
have
evidence
in
this
record
of
three
instances
where
inmates
have
ever
even
sought
appointment
of
counsel
before
a
petition
was
filed.
in
two
of
those
instances,
the
trial
courts
appointed
counsel.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
in
the
third,
the
trial
court
did
not.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
the
record
in
this
case
contains
the
order
from
the
trial
court
in
that
case.
we
had
defended
in
the
lower
courts
on
the
basis
that
he
had
counsel
at
the
time
that
motion
was
made.
there
are
some
questions
to
be
concerned
about
that
case,
but
still,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
that
inmate
ever
made
any
use
of
the
resources
available
to
him
at
the
institution.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
yes,
your
honor,
in
every
case.
it
is
not
the
same
as
the
trial
attorney.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
inmates
often
do
raise
that
very
claim,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
as
of
now,
every
inmate
has
had
a
lawyer.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
as
of
now,
we
think
there
are
systems
in
place
that
will
make
certain
that
any
inmate
who
makes
a
request
will
get
a
lawyer.
it
is
not
guaranteed.
it
is
possible
that
he
may
have
to
rely
on
the
resources
available
to
him
at
the
institution.
but
we
would
say,
that
institution
is
much
more
than
is
necessary
for
him
to
get
his
claims
in
front
of
the
court.
in
any
case
in
virginia,
whether
it
is
a
death
case
or
any
other
case,
if
the
inmate
makes
some
colorable
showing
of
a
claim,
counsel
will
be
appointed.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
thank
you.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
first
point
that
i
would
like
to
correct
is
the
suggestion
that
was
made
here
this
morning
that
there
was
somewhere
in
the
line
of
90
to
180
days
between
the
time
of
sentencing
and
the
time
of
execution.
the
average
time
in
virgin
between
the
imposition
of
sentence
and
execution
is
roughly
seven
years.
the
average
time
for
getting
a
conviction
affirmed
in
the
virgin
supreme
court
is
eight
months.
this
is
not
a
rush
to
judgement
in
these
cases.
on
the
matter
of
mr.
washington's
motion
for
appointment
of
counsel
in
the
circuit
court,
the
record
does
show
that
seven
weeks
after
this
court
denied
cert
on
his
direct
appeal,
he
appeared
in
the
circuit
court
for
purposes
of
setting
an
execution
date.
he
appeared
with
counsel.
his
attorney
asked
the
court
to
appoint
counsel
to
represent
him,
telling
the
court
that
he
knew
his
client
was
not
entitled
to
it.
he
also
represented
to
the
court
that
a
volunteer
group,
the
aclu,
was
looking
to
find
an
attorney
to
represent
mr.
washington,
and
he
represented
to
the
court
that
there
was
going
to
be
an
attorney
out
there...
a
volunteer
attorney
out
there...
to
file
a
subsequent
habeas
corpus
action.
the
trial
court
denied
the
motion
at
that
time,
and
indicated
that
he
was
leaving
the
matter
open,
because
he
anticipated
there
was
going
to
be
future
activity
to
request
a
stay,
or
some
other
matters.
this
is
not
a
matter
of
the
trial
court
saying
there
is
no
availability
of
counsel.
this
is
simply
a
matter
of
the
trial
court
denying
a
motion
on
the
understanding
that
was
given
to
him
that
volunteer
counsel
was
going
to
appear.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
that
is
a
rough
average,
and--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--no,
usually
the
first
state
habeas
corpus
petition
would
be
filed
rather
promptly
after
the
denial
of
cert.--
i
think
that
the
longest
time
there
has
ever
been
between
a
certiorari
denial
and
filing
would
be
maybe
six
months
at
the
longest.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
i
cannot
explain
any
one
item.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
i
do
not
see
any
one
area
as
being
particularly
difficult.
there
are
some--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--it
is
an
expedited
process
in
virginia.
it
is
given
priority
on
the
virginia
supreme
court's
docket.
it
is
set
for
immediate
briefing,
and
it
is
set
at
the
earliest
argument
date.
and
the
virginia
supreme
court
has
a
practice
of
deciding
cases
heard
in
one
term
by
the
next
time
they
sit.
that
is
the
practice
of
the
court.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
well,
i
will
give
you
an
example...
mr.
giarratano's
case
in
this.
he
is
the
named
plaintiff
in
this
action.
he
was
convicted
in
1979.
he
filed
his
state
habeas
proceedings,
i
believe,
in
1980.
they
were
completed
by
1983,
which
includes
both
a
hearing
in
the
state
circuit
court
on
allegations
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
and
a
review
on
the
denial
of
habeas
corpus
relief
to
the
virginia
supreme
court.
i
believe
in
march
of
1983,
he
filed
his
habeas
corpus
action
in
the
federal
district
court.
that
was
dismissed
last
december,
finally,
and
it
is
now
pending
in
the
fourth
circuit.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
that
habeas
action
pended,
was
interrupted
on
several
occasions...
the
last
occasion
that
it
was
interrupted
was,
mr.
giarratano
added
another
claim
which
made
a
mixed
petition,
and
he
was
allowed
to
go
back
to
state
court
to
file
a
second
state
petition
while
the
district
court
kept
the
federal
action
open.
these
cases
take
time.
they
do
not
need
to.
they
certainly
do
not
need
to
take
this
long.
we
certainly,
though,
do
not
want
to
add
another
layer
of
litigation.
i
do
not
agree
with
mr.
zerkin's
statement
that
there
is
not
going
to
be
any
additional
delay
in
these
matters.
there
may
not
be
a
habeas
corpus
petition
challenging
the
conviction,
because
of
ineffective
assistance
of
habeas
counsel,
but
there
will
certainly
be
a
habeas
petition
challenging
the
habeas
action.
it
is
a
cost
to
the
state
from
this
new
right
to
counsel
that
we
have
to
relitigate
every
state
habeas
corpus
action,
because
each
time
the
petitioner
insists
another
right
to
counsel
to
litigate
the
next
state
habeas
corpus
action.
we
will
be
doing
this
on
and
on
and
on,
and
i
do
not
think
this
court
should
be
sending
the
message
out
there
that
these
prisoners
have
a
right
to
litigate
indefinitely,
particularly
in
these
matters.
and
we
are
talking
about
litigation
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
trial,
nothing
to
do
with
the
determination
of
guilt.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
well,
again,
we
are
talking
about
a
system
in
virgin
where
the
delay
is
not
caused
by
an
absence
of
counsel.
they
have
all
had
counsel,
and
there
is
still
delay.
that
is
not
the
cause
of
the
delay.
but
if
we
add
counsel,
we
are
guaranteeing
more
delay.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
if
we
are
creating
a
new
constitutional
right
to
counsel,
presumably
there
will
be
some
right
to
seek
redress
in
some
court
if
you
have
a
claim
against
that
counsel,
even
under--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--no,
i
am
talking
about
an
extra
right
to
an
additional
collateral
review
of
collateral
counsel.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
florida
has
made
that
decision.
they
have
created
this
right
to
counsel
for
their
prisoners
under
state
law.
they
are
not--
mr.
robert
q.
harris
--but
they
have
not
given
them
that
state-created
remedy
of
attacking
collateral
counsel.
mr.
robert
q.
harris
florida
gives
them
a
representative
for
their
actions,
but
it
has
specifically
said,
we
did
not
mean
to
create
another
layer
of
litigation
by
doing
that.
