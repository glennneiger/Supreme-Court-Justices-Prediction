because
you
have
to
do
something.
justice
white
you
have
to
have
either
a
law
library
or
some
kind
of
legal
assistance.
justice
white
the
point
was
just
that
they
do
not
always
provide
counsel
to
help
people
prepare
a
habeas
petition.
justice
white
well,
that
is
quite
an
incentive.
justice
white
that
is
not
going
to
help
much.
the
real
problem
is
having
help
to
get
the
petition
filed
in
the
first
place.
justice
white
how
do
you
file
a
motion...
you
mean,
even
before
anything
else
is
filed?
justice
white
well,
if
virginia
is
not
living
up
to
its
duty
under
bounds
to
provide
access
to
these
death
row
people,
i
would
suppose
that
it
is
also
falling
its
duty
under
bounds
to
non-capital
inmates.
certainly
i
would
say
a
fortiori
that
they
are
not.
justice
white
well,
what
about
the
library?
justice
white
well,
did
the
district
court
order
cover
help,
legal
help,
in
filing
federal
post-conviction
writs?
justice
white
i
suppose
then
that
the
inmates
in
virginia
could
go
right
into
federal
habeas
if
they
do
not
get
any
help?
