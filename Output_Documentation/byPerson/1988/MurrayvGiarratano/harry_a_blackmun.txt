justice
blackmun
you
are
not
thereby
suggesting
that
virginia
is
particularly
gracious
toward
prisoners
of
this
kind?
it
is
one
of
the
tougher
states
in
the
union,
don't
you
think?
justice
blackmun
that
is
your
basic
argument,
that
you
are
just
within
the
constitutional
prerequisites?
justice
blackmun
i
am
really
suggesting
that
the
old
dominion
is
one
of
the
tougher
states
in
the
union.
justice
blackmun
and
is
that
not
rather
unusual
among
the
states
of
this
country?
justice
blackmun
and
of
course,
your
rights
of
direct
appeal
are
rather
limited
in
the
old
dominion.
justice
blackmun
but
generally,
they
are.
justice
blackmun
whom
they
recently
installed,
i
might
say.
justice
blackmun
and
who
determines
whether
it
is
or
is
not
frivolous?
justice
blackmun
that
was
not
a
capital
case.
justice
blackmun
do
you
really
believe
that?
hasn't
this
court
said
many
times
that
death
is
different?
justice
blackmun
why
do
you
think
that
a
majority
of
the
states
with
capital
punishment
have,
by
statute,
created
a
right
to
have
counsel
in
matters
of
this
kind?
justice
blackmun
i
think
there
are
19.
