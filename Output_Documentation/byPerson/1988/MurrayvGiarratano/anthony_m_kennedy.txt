justice
kennedy
if
we
ruled
in
your
favor,
would
it
be
acceptable
or
recommended
that
we
relax
the
requirements
of
for
cause
showing
on
federal
habeas,
so
that
if
it
is
a
pro
se
litigant
we
are
less
strict
about
procedural
bar
in
federal
proceedings?
justice
kennedy
well,
but
you
are
asking
us
to
adopt
a
rule
that
you
do
not
require
a
lawyer.
that
is
what
you
are
asking
us
to
do.
justice
kennedy
so,
in
your
view,
the
right
which
you
are
claiming,
or
the
relief
that
you
are
claiming,
would
be
satisfied
by
the
courts
appointing
incompetent
counsel?
justice
kennedy
so
part
of
the
relief
you
are
requesting
is
a
constitutional
rule
that
capable,
competent
counsel
be
appointed
to
give
rights
of
access
to
the
court.
