mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
their
effort
to
conjure
up
the
specter
of
additional
rounds
of
litigation
in
death
penalty
cases,
the
petitioners
have
misrepresented
the
nature
of
the
constitutional
right
recognized
by
the
district
court,
and
exaggerated
the
scope
of
the
relief
granted
by
it.
in
fact,
the
courts
below
did
not
rely
upon
or
create
a
right
to
counsel.
rather,
the
courts
simply
applied
the
rule
in
bounds
and
its
progeny
to
the
particular
circumstances
of
virginia's
death
row
and
of
capital
post-conviction
litigation,
and
ordered
only
a
small--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--which
gave
each
of
them
attorneys
to
assist
in
the
preparation
and
investigation
of
their
claim
and
the
preparation
of
their
petitions.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
well,
it
is
different
in
terms
of
right
to
counsel
being
a
term
of
art
that
has
certain
implications
under
the
constitution.
that
is
what
they
have
attempted
to
do
in
this
case.
this
court
recognized--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--the
difference
has
to
do
with
the
fact
that
we
do
not
have
the
court
creating
a
right
which
is
somehow
enforceable
in
a
collateral
proceeding
on
a
new
habeas
corpus,
which
is
the
specter
which
the
state
is
attempting
to
create
here.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
well,
theoretically...
i
mean,
it
is
not
as
a
conceptual
matter.
the
performance
of
the
habeas
attorney,
even
assuming
that
he
does
a
poor
job,
does
not
go
to
the
validity
of
the
original
sentence
and
conviction.
therefore,
it
is
not
even
a
subject
of
a
new
habeas
corpus
action,
because
you
are...
when
you
are
challenging
the
effectiveness
of
habeas
counsel,
you
are
not
challenging
the
validity
of
the
original
sentence
and
conviction.
so,
you
cannot
bring
a
new
habeas
action.
indeed,
the
fourth
circuit
specifically
dealt
with
this
issue
in
the
whitley
case.
mr.
whitley
raised...
brought
a
second
challenge
in
which
he
claimed
the
ineffectiveness
of
his
habeas
counsel.
in
that
second
whitley
case...
it
was
a
successor
petition...
the
fourth
circuit
said
you
cannot
do
that,
and
mr.
whitley
was
in
fact
executed
on
schedule.
so,
the
fourth
circuit
jousted
with
this
and
resolved
it
already.
now,
what
is
different
here
is--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--no,
sir,
we
do
not
say
that.
the
court...
we
believe
that
the
level
of
assistance
that
can
be
provided,
that
is
being
provided
in
any
bounds
case
can
go
so
low
that
meaningful
access
is
not
being
provided.
if
i
might
give
an
example,
in
the
mccall
cases
to
which
this
court
ordered
an
inquiry,
a
response
by
the
state
as
to
the
right
to
counsel
in
preparing
a
habeas
petition,
the
institutional
attorney
at
mecklenburg,
who
was
in
fact
partly
the
subject
of
this
litigation,
filed
a
habeas
petition
that
included
a
non-federal
claim.
now,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
that
is
not
meaningful
and
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
so--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--yes,
in
death
penalty
cases
on
virginia's
death
row.
that
is
correct.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
the
question
is
whether
or
not--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--the
result
would...
it
depends
on
the
facts
of
the
case.
we
have
a
two
day
trial
here.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
i
will
try.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
no,
sir,
my
answer
to
that
is
no.
the
reason
is
because
the
issue
first
of
all
was
an
issue
of
access,
and
if
a
system
existed
in
north
carolina,
which
in
fact
it
does,
as
a
result
of
the
bounds
litigation
itself
and
the
fourth
circuit's
most
recent
affirmance
of
the
district
court's
action
in
bounds
which
provided
attorneys,
then
in
fact
if
that
access
is
being
provided,
then
the
violation
of
the
right
would
never
occur
in
the
first
place.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
if
that
decision
was
supported
by
the
factual
record
in
the
case,
then
it
could
reach
that
conclusion.
the
problem
here
is--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--i
disagree
with
the
premise
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
right
to
counsel.
that
is
my
difficulty
in
asking
the
question
directly.
we
are
dealing
with
access,
and
the
question
would
be
whether
or
not
the
fact...
the
district
court's
findings
in
north
carolina...
that
there
was
access,
and
therefore
no
violation
of
the
right
to
access
under
bounds
was
supported
by
the
evidentiary
record
in
that
case.
that
is
the
very
confusion
that
they
create,
and
that
is
created
by
defining
this
as
a
separate
right,
that
is,
the
right
to
counsel.
what
has
happened
here
is
that
the
court
looked
at
bounds,
looked
at
the
specific
circumstances,
determined
that
there
was
a
violation
of
bounds
under
the
facts,
and
then
using
its
discretion
as
a
court
of
equity,
fashioned
a
remedy.
in
fact,
what
the
district
court
did
was,
it
did
not
even
order
the
nature
of
the
system
that
the
state
had
to
give.
all
it
said
was,
the
only
adjustment
we
want
you
to
make
is,
appoint
counsel
pre-petition.
how
you
go
about
arranging
that
system
is
up
to
you.
it
did
not
dictate
any
of
that
to
the
state.
the
state
in
fact,
did
not
respond
except
by
providing
a
memo
to
circuit
court
judges
that
said,
"if
you
get
a
request,
appoint
counsel.
"
now,
the
petitioners...
one
of
the
problems
here,
and
we
see
it
so
far
in
the
argument,
is
that
they
have
attempted
to
ignore
the
factual
record
in
the
case.
the
petitioners
have
insisted
throughout
this
litigation
that
institutional
attorneys
are
available
to
prepare
and
file
habeas
petitions,
and
thus
they
were
meeting
their
affirmative
obligations
under
bounds
to
provide
meaningful
access.
in
fact,
at
the
penitentiary
where
death-sentenced
inmates
are
housed
entirely
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
prison
population
during
at
least
the
last
15
days...
the
critical
last
15
days
before
their
execution...
the
institutional
attorneys
at
the
penitentiary
did
not
even
appear
at
that--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--yes,
i
would
agree,
your
honor.
the
reason
that
it
is
critical--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--well,
the
reason
that
i
just
said
it
is
from
what
your
honor
just
suggested,
which
is
that
if
a
petition
has
not
been
filed,
then
obviously
that
last
period
of
time
is
the
most
critical,
because
time
is
running
out.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
i
agree,
and
unfortunately
the
access
is
not
being
provided
at
the
earlier
stage
to
ensure
that,
either.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
no,
sir,
that
does
not...
in
itself--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--no,
but
typically
what
happens
is--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--no,
less.
less.
typically
what
happens
is
that
by
statute
it
has
to...
the
date
must
be
30
days
after
the
date
is
imposed.
you
have
to
give
30
day
leeway.
typically
what
happens
is
that
after
affirmance
on
direct
appeal,
sometimes
prior
to
denial
of
cert
by
this
court,
if
cert
has
been
requested,
sometimes
after
the
inmate
is
brought
back
before
the
circuit
court
judge,
and
a
date
is
set.
i
would
suggest
that
it
is
more
like
90
days
than
it
is
to
180.
but
the
difficulty
is
that
the
access
is
not
being
provided
at
mecklenburg
on
death
row
itself
before
that
time.
and
the
facts
in
the
case
amply
demonstrate
that.
the--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--what
happens
in
the
last
15
days
is,
he
is
in
the
death
house,
isolated
from
the
rest
of
the
population
at
the
penitentiary.
there
are...
there
was
a
period
of
three
months
where
the
institutional
attorneys
assigned
to
that
facility
did
not
even
appear
at
the
institution.
he
has
no
access
to
a
law
library
at
all.
so,
at
that
point,
no
access
is
being
provided
in
any
fashion.
in
addition,
at
mecklenburg,
prior
to
that...
and
what
the
petitioners
in
this
case
ignore
is
the
fact
that
the
institutional
attorneys
had
informed
the
inmates
that
they
did
not
do
death
cases.
in
fact,
the
record
shows
that
mr.
giarratano
filed
a
grievance
concerning
the
lack
of
assistance
for
mr.
boggs
and
for
mr.
watkins,
and
that
that
grievance
was
ignored.
in
fact,
neither
of
those
inmates
even
had
a
complete
trial
transcript,
and
the
institutional
attorney
did
not
even
attempt
to
obtain
mr.
boggs'
transcript
during
the
pendency
of
this
action.
equally
important,
the
district
court
found
as
a
factual
matter
that
even
assuming
that
institutional
attorneys
are
available,
given
the
nature
of
death
penalty
litigation,
these
inmates
need
more
than
the
sporadic
assistance
of
talking
law
books
to
ensure
meaningful
access.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
not
necessarily,
justice
white,
and
the
reason
is
that...
and
they
may
be.
they
have
something
like
eight
attorneys
for
2,000
inmates.
but
the
reason
that
it
does
not
necessarily
apply
is
because
the
institutional
attorneys,
as
to
death
row,
have
told
the
inmates
that
they
do
not
handle
capital
cases.
they
have
not
told
that
to
the
population
at
large,
but
the
evidence
establishes
that
they
did
tell
that
to
the
death
row
inmates.
we
also
know
that
as
to
death
row,
mr.
giarratano
filed
a
grievance
about
the
lack
of
held
from
institutional
attorneys,
and
that
that
request
was
denied.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
the...
at
mecklenburg,
the
problem
with
the
library
is
that
the
access
is
limited
to
two
and
a
half
hours
twice
a
week.
now,
in
a
normal...
and
this
is
what
is
critically
different
about
death
penalty
litigation...
in
a
normal
case
where
an
inmate
has
a
term
of
years
to
prepare
his
habeas
petition,
two
and
a
half
hours
twice
a
week
may
give
him
enough
time
to
prepare
a
petition
over
the
course
of
a
year.
this
inmate
is
going
to
be
dead
in
90
days.
he
does
not
have...
he
cannot
take
that
two
and
a
half
hours
twice
a
week
and
stretch
it
out
for
however
long
it
takes
for
him
to
prepare
a
petition.
if
we
are
dealing
with
a
population
in
particular
which
has
a
lower
intelligence
level
than
the
general
population
to
begin
with,
what
we
end
up
with...
and
even
without
that,
but
particularly
with
that...
it
is
absurd
to
think
that
that
inmate,
given
the
complexity
of
capital
litigation,
can
possibly
prepare
a
meaningful
habeas
petition
during
that
90
day
period
when
on
top
of
everything
else,
he
has
the
threat
of
execution
hanging
over
his
head.
it
is
difficult
enough
for
us
to
sit
down
in
a
law
library
that
is
nice
and
quiet
and
figure
out
capital
litigation.
you
are
asking
this
man
with
the
clock
ticking,
who
has
no
education,
to
prepare
a
habeas
petition
within
90
days.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
yes,
justice
o'connor,
we
do.
in
fact,
we
have--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--yes,
we
do.
in
fact,
we
have
more
than
that
in
this
case.
and
mr.
washington's
case
is
perhaps
the
best
example.
mr.
washington,
in
fact,
did
everything
that
they
suggest
and
he
came
up
empty.
he
not
only...
he
did
not
write
to
the
court,
he
appeared
in
court,
in
front
of
the
sentencing
judge
on
the
date
his
execution
was
being
set,
and
he
said,
through
his
attorney,
who
stated
to
the
judge
that
he
was
not
going
to
represent
him
on
habeas...
in
fact,
he
was
not
going
to
represent
him
on
habeas
because
the
assistant
attorney
general
had
told
him
he
could
not,
because
he
had
been
trial
counsel.
he
made
the
motion
at
that
time
for
appointment
of
counsel,
and
the
circuit
court
judge
denied
the
motion
on
the
very
specific
grounds
that
it
is
not
available.
the
appointment
of
counsel
for
habeas
is
not
available
in
virginia
until
an
evidentiary
hearing
is
granted.
so,
in
fact,
when
counsel
suggests
that
this
does
not
happen,
in
fact
it
has
happened.
mr.
washington's
situation
is
actually
even
worse
than
that,
because
his
situation
was...
mr.
giarratano
filed
this
case
pro
se,
this
case,
prior
to
the
washington
situation
reaching
that
crisis.
mr.
giarratano
wrote
to
the
district
court
judge
about
mr.
washington's
situations,
and
that
was
treated
as
an
amendment
to
the
pleadings.
the
ag's
office
at
that
point
was
served
with
it.
they
knew
that
mr.
washington
wanted
counsel,
that
he
had
been
denied
counsel,
and
that
he
was
receiving
no
assistance...
and
yet
no
assistance
was
provided.
in
fact,
mr.
washington
was
then
transferred,
and
here
we
get
to
the
critical
15
days,
because
time...
he
still
did
not
have
access.
he
goes
to
the
penitentiary,
and
he
continues
to
tell
the
attorney
general's
office,
who
is
supervising
the
death
house,
that
he
wants
counsel...
he
wants
to
proceed.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
but
he
has
no...
he
does
not
even
have
the
assistance
at
that
point
of
an
institutional
attorney
to
assist
him
in
preparing.
remember
this...
part
of
their
position
is
that
the
system,
what
system
exists,
they
say
all
you
have
to
do
is--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--thank
you,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
i
believe
i
was
attempting
to
respond
to
justice
o'connor's
inquiry
concerning
the
facts
of
a
request
for
assistance
from
the
institutional
attorneys,
and
what
has
come
of
all
of
that.
as
part
of
that,
i
wanted
to
point
out,
and
again
in
the
record,
and
emphasize
that
this
was
tried
on
the
facts,
and
there
is
an
ample
factual
record
in
this
case.
of
course,
we
have
been
through
mr.
washington's
requests
for
counsel
when
he
appeared
in
front
of
the
trial
judge,
and
it
should
also
be
noted
that
mr.
washington
has
an
i.q.
of
69.
in
addition,
it
should
be
noted
that
contrary
to
counsel's
suggestions
this
morning,
the
attorney
general
did
not
join
in
the
motion
in
front
of
the
circuit
court
judge
when
mr.
washington
made
the
request
for
counsel.
in
fact,
the
attorney
who
was
present
was
silent
through
that,
and
sat
silently
while
mr.
washington
was
denied
that
appointment.
although
in
the
original
trial
record
we
were
dependent
upon
the
order
that
is
part
of
the
appendix,
just
the
other
day
the
state
lodged
with
this
court
the
actual
trial
transcript
of
the
hearing
in
which
mr.
washington
was
denied
counsel.
and
the
court
will
see
that
in
fact
our
scenario
of
what
happened
there
is
very
accurate.
in
addition,
however,
mr.
giarratano
had
talked
to
the
institutional
attorney
specifically
about
helping
mr.
washington.
the
institutional
attorney
did
nothing
to
assist
him.
subsequently,
of
course,
mr.
washington
was
transferred
to
the
state
penitentiary,
and
the
general
rule
for
the
institutional
attorneys
at
the
state
penitentiary
is
that
these,
the
assistance
they
are
to
provide,
is
not
intended
to
be
very
complex.
indeed,
the
general
rule
is
that
they
are
only
supposed
to
devote
one
hour
to
an
inmate.
in
fact,
while
mr.
washington
was
there,
the
institutional
attorneys
did
not
visit
the
institution
and
did
not
know...
did
not
know...
that
mr.
washington
was
present,
despite
the
fact
that
he
continued
to
indicate,
and
the
attorney
general
knew,
that
mr.
washington
wanted
to
proceed
with
habeas
corpus.
in
addition,
mr.
kulp,
the
senior
attorney
general
in
charge
of
capital
litigation,
testified
at
trial
that
they
would
indeed
have
executed
mr.
washington
even
though
no
papers
were
filed
on
his
behalf,
and
even
though
no
volunteer
attorney
was
forthcoming,
and
clearly
even
though
no
institutional
attorney
was
brought
down
to
assist
him,
and
even
though
clearly
he
had
no
access
to
a
law
library.
mr.
giarratano
also
filed
a
grievance
concerning
mr.
watkins
and
mr.
boggs,
the
intervenor
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
and
mr.
boggs
and
mr.
watkins
remained
without
any
assistance
from
the
institutional
attorney
for
a
year,
even
during
the
pendency
of
this
lawsuit...
so
even
while
they
knew
that
this
was
at
issue,
for
a
year
they
remained
without
any
assistance,
and
indeed
the
institutional
attorney
visited
them
at
their
cell,
obtained
part
of
the
record,
and
did
nothing
more.
as
i
indicated
before,
in
the
case
of
one
of
them,
he
did
not
even
attempt
to
get
the
completed
transcript.
at
trial,
judge
merhige
asked
him
about
that,
and
he
said,
well,
at
some
point
i
am
going
to
have
to
do
that.
now,
the
only
reason
that
this
dragged
on
for
this
year
was
because
this
case
was
pending
at
the
trial
level,
and
so
no
one
proceeded
to
set
execution
dates
for
mr.
boggs
and
mr.
watkins
while
they
were
receiving
none
of
this
assistance,
because
of
the
pendency
of
this
case.
however,
it
is
clear
from
prior
practice,
and
it
is
clear
from
the
experience
of
mr.
washington
that
had
this
case
not
been
pending,
and
even
though
they
were
receiving
no
assistance,
that
the
state
would
have
proceeded
to
set
execution
dates
and
would
have
proceeded
in
fact
to
execute
them.
in
addition,
we
have
the
instance
of
mr.
evans,
wilbur
evans,
who
proceeded
mr.
washington
on
death
row.
mr.
evans
got
as
far
as
three
days
before
being
executed.
he,
too,
was
in
the
death
house
of
the
penitentiary,
and
a
volunteer
lawyer
appeared
and
filed
papers
on
mr.
evans'
behalf.
what
is
significant
about
that
is
that
subsequently,
as
part
of
mr.
evans'
habeas
petition,
the
state
confessed
error.
his
sentence
was
reversed
not
merely
because
he
won
through
litigation.
the
state
actually
confessed
error
in
mr.
evans'
case,
and
yet
they
were
prepared
to
execute
him
at
that
point,
even
though
he
had
no
assistance.
mr.
giarratano,
in
addition,
while
he
was
in
isolation
asked
for
the
assistance
of
the
institutional
attorney,
and
also
asked
for
access
to
the
law
library.
he
was
refused
as
to
both
of
those.
he
received
neither
the
assistance
of
the
institutional
attorney,
nor
was
he
allowed
access
to
the
library.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
yes,
your
honor.
the
error--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--as
to...
they
had
relied
upon
convictions
from
the
state
of
north
carolina
that
were
invalid.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
yes,
sir,
and
he
received
new
sentencing.
that
is
correct.
there
is
another
particular
factor
that
supports
the
district
court's
decision
that
makes
death
penalty
litigation
completely
different
from
other
litigation,
and
that
is
the
procedural
need
to
obtain
stays
in
order
to
litigate
your
claim.
i
mean,
you
cannot
have
meaningful
access
if
you
do
not
obtain
a
stay
in
the
meantime.
and
justice
scalia
has
questioned
the
relevance
of
this
last
15
day
period
when
he
was
at
mecklenburg
before
that.
i
would
suggest
two
responses
to
that.
which...
the
first
one
is,
of
course,
that
they
were
not
receiving
access
while
they
were
at
mecklenburg.
but
the
other
is
that
it
may
well
be
that
once...
even
if
he
has
received
some
assistance
prior
that
it
is
necessary
to
obtain
a
stay,
and
it
may
very
well
be
within
that
last
15
days.
now,
something
critical
happens
here.
the
attorney
who
is
providing
the
advice
at
mecklenburg,
and
is
allegedly
helping
to
prepare
these
papers,
even
though
in
fact
we
know
they
do
not...
he
gives
up
jurisdiction
over
this
inmate
when
this
inmate
is
transferred
to
the
penitentiary.
so
even
assuming
that
he
is
beginning
to
work
on
this
case,
he
throws
up
his
hands
as
soon
as
the
inmate
leaves
and
is
sent
to
the
penitentiary,
and
now,
15
days
prior,
an
institutional
attorney
who
is
supposed
to
devote
one
hour
to
a
case,
who
has
no
prior
knowledge
of
this
inmate,
now
must
pick
up
the
ball,
presumably,
somehow,
even
though
there
is
no
explanation
for
this,
get
the
work
product
of
the
institutional
attorney
at
mecklenburg,
if
there
is
any,
and
proceed
to
obtain
this
stay
and
get
this
habeas
petition
filed
if
it
has
not
been
filed
already.
it
is
also
significant
to
this
kind--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--well,
as
i
indicated
to
chief
justice
rehnquist,
that
does
not
result
in
a
new
habeas
petition,
because
theoretically
that
is
not
a
basis
for
habeas
corpus.
what--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--what
it
could
result
in
would
be
what
would
exist
even
at
the
present
time,
which
would
be
a
claim
that
he
had
been
denied
access
under
bounds.
it
could
be
done
in
the
context
of
1983.
now,
what
is
interesting
about
that
is--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--no,
i
disagree
with
that.
i
think
that
the
basis
of
that
would
be
within...
under
the
standard
of
meaningful
access,
which
i
think
is
very
different
from
a
standard
of
effective
assistance
of
counsel...
that
could
be
raised.
but
even--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--the
standard--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--i
think
that
the
constitutional
standard
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
and
the
standard
for
providing
meaningful
access,
are
not
necessarily
the
same.
i
think,
in
fact,
that
they
are
different.
i
think
that
there
is
a
lower
standard
as
to
the
performance
of
providing
access.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
well,
we
think
clearly
that
you
do
need
counsel,
and
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
for
that.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
well,
we
would
like
to
have
competent
counsel.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
no,
we
would
not
say
he
is
incompetent.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
your
honor
is
drawing
a
line
distinction
that
says
attorneys
are
either
one
or
the
other,
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
within
the
concept
of
meaningful
access,
there
are
certain
things
which
that
attorney
must
do
in
order
to
provide
meaningful
access
in
a
capital
case.
he
must
review
the
record.
he
must
examine
the
briefs.
he
must
interview
the
inmate.
he
must
talk
to
the
trial
counsel,
so
that
he
can
develop
claims
of
ineffective
assistance.
that
is
particularly
important
in
virginia,
where
the
virginia
supreme
court
does
not
review
the
entire
record
for
error.
therefore,
as
this
court
noted
in
kimmeiman,
it
is
only
an
attorney
who
is
likely
to
be
able
to
see
claims
of
ineffective
assistance
of
the
trial
counsel.
we
believe
that
the
system
that
should
be
set
up...
and
again,
virginia
has
not--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--yes.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
lack
of
access.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
yes,
there
would.
and
what
is
interesting
then
is
how
that--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--no,
sir.
what
is
interesting
about
that
is
that
that
would
then
fall
within
the
class
action
order
that
is
part
of
this
case,
and
so
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
that
inmate
had
received
access
would
be
defined
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
the
petitioners
in
this
case
were
complying
with
the
order
of
the
district
court
that
required
them
to
provide
access.
so,
actually,
the
advantage
of
it
is
that
rather
than
simply
having
any
inmate
who
even
now
has
the
ability
to
bring
a
1983
action
claiming
that
he
has
been
denied
access...
that
in
fact,
the
results
of
that,
that
all
of
those
on
death
row
would
be
consolidated
within
the
scope
of
this
action,
and
it
would...
the
question
would
be
whether
or
not
the
order
of
this
district
court
was
being
violated.
so,
in
that
sense,
i
think
that
in
fact
it
consolidates
them,
rather
than
creating
additional
problems.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
no,
your
honor,
only
as
to...
only
as
to
an
inmate
who
was
immediately
facing
execution,
and
as
to--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--well,
i
think
within
the
standard
definitions
of
what
one
is
allowed
to...
the
basis
of
a
temporary
restraining
order
or
a
preliminary
injunction.
if
we
determined
that
as
to
a
particular
inmate,
he
was
not
receiving
access,
then
indeed
it
would
be
our
obligation
as
class
counsel
to
file
an
appropriate
motion
with
the
district
court
to
indicate
that
this
inmate
was
not
receiving
that
counsel.
nothing
can
prevent
anyone
from
filing
a
claim.
i
think
the
legitimate
concern...
the
legitimate
concern
is
whether
or
not
the
ability
of
the
inmate
to
make
a
claim
that
he
is
not
receiving
access
will
result
in
additional
proceedings
and
a
delay
of
the
execution.
that
is
what
this
court
has
repeatedly
indicated
it
has
a
problem
with.
the
question
is
not
whether
he
can
file
it.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
he
can
stave
off
the
execution
by
doing
it.
we
know,
in
fact,
from
mr.
whitley's
case
that
he
failed.
he
was
executed
on
schedule.
that
would
seem
to
be
the
concern.
now,
the
problem
here
is
that
what
is
being
raised
are
problems
which
the
state
has
within
its
power
to
prevent...
that
is,
rather
than
simply
doing
what
they
did,
which
was
in
response
to
the
judge's
order,
which
was
issuing
this
memorandum
to
state
circuit
court
judges
and
then
throwing
up
their
hands
as
to
any
further
responsibility...
if
they
set
up
a
system
which
indeed
assured
that
these
institutional
attorneys
would
assist,
that
had
some
monitoring
aspect
of
it,
then
indeed
they
could
avoid
the
very
problems
that
the
court
is
concerned
with.
the
reason
that
those
problems
potentially
exist
is
that
virginia
has
been
totally
non-responsive
to
the
district
court's
order.
in
fact,
what
is
interesting
in
this
case
from
the
papers
filed
that
are
part
of
the
appendix,
that
were
filed
in
the
fourth
circuit
in
connection
with
the
motion
to
stay
the
mandate
is
that
even
in
response
to
the
district
court's
order,
what
it
required
was
that
i
had
to
repeatedly
write
letters
to
the
circuit
court
judges
reminding
them
of
judge
merhige's
order,
and
asking
them
to
appoint
counsel.
they
did
absolutely
nothing
to
effectuate
the
order
of
the
district
court.
so,
these
theoretical
problems
are
within
the
power
of
the
state
to
prevent.
the
mention...
one
of
the
problems
that
we
have
here
is
that
death
penalty
litigation
does
not
necessarily
proceed
on
the
orderly
course
on
which
other
litigation
proceeds,
and
this
court
is
well
aware
of
that.
one
of
the
problems
is
that
if
a
stay
is
denied
by
a
state
circuit
court
judge,
it
is
necessary
to
proceed
at
a
higher
level
state
court,
or
in
federal
court,
in
order
to
obtain
a
stay
in
order
to
litigate
those
claims.
if
you
do
not
have
an
attorney
monitoring
that,
bringing
the
motion
for
a
stay
to
the
attention
of
the
judge...
indeed,
in
virginia,
circuit
court
judges
still
circuit-ride.
we
have
under
the
code
circuits
that
have
10
separate
counties
and
two
judges.
there
is
no
automatic
provision
for
any
of
these
filings
to
be
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
circuit
court
judge.
indeed,
if
the
order
is
entered,
the
inmate
has
no
way
to
even
know
that
it
has
been
entered.
he
has
no
basis
for
knowing
at
what
point
it
is
necessary
for
him
to
prepare
and
file
papers
either
in
the
virginia
supreme
court
or
in
the
united
states
district
court.
none
of
this
can
be
done
without
an
attorney,
and
it
is
applicable
only
to
death
penalty
cases.
now--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--no,
your
honor.
that
problem
has
been
solved
by
virtue
of
the
passage
of
the
anti-drug
bill,
in
which
the
federal
courts
now,
under
that
statute,
will
appoint
counsel
in
federal
habeas
upon
request
in
any
death
case,
state
or
federal.
so,
the
district
court
denied
that.
the
district
court
envisioned
that
that
state
habeas
attorney
would
in
fact
file
the
petition
in
federal
court
and
the
federal
court
would
then
appoint
and
the
federal
government
would
pay
for
that.
but
that
problem
has
been
taken
care
of
now.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
well,
it
creates
an
interesting
dilemma,
and
it
is
somewhat
responsive
to
what
justice
kennedy
asked
before.
that
is,
imagine
the
chaos
of
this,
that
not
having
any
access
into
state
court.
the
inmate
writes
a
letter
to
the
district
court
and
says
appoint
me
counsel
so
i
can
proceed
on
federal
habeas.
they
appoint
counsel.
this
attorney,
who
has
now
been
appointed
under
the
federal
statute
for
federal
court
now
has
this
host
of
unexhausted
claims.
is
that
attorney
now
supposed
to
proceed
either
under
payment
by
the
federal
government
or
pro
bono,
or
is
he
supposed
to
simply
say,
"that
is
too
bad.
"
"you
have
these
legitimate
claims,
but
you
have
not
exhausted
them,
and
therefore
i
cannot
help
you
in
federal
court.
"
