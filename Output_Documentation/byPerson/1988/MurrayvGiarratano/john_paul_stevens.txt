justice
stevens
mr.
harris,
in
that
direct
review,
does
the
state
supreme
court
review
the
entire
record
in
every
case?
justice
stevens
but
not
on
the
merits
of
the
original
case?
justice
stevens
it
does
not
necessarily
review
the
entire
record
on
the
appeal
on
the
merits
of
the
conviction,
does
it?
justice
stevens
may
i
interrupt
just
a
second,
mr.
harris?
you
rely...
you
mention
the
background.
there
is
this
independent
volunteer
organization
that
has,
in
fact,
provided
counsel,
and
that
trial
judges
have
in
fact
gone
out
of
the
way
to
get
lawyers
for
the
inmates
in
these
death
cases.
but
your
legal
position
would
be
exactly
the
same
if
none
of
that
had
happened,
as
i
understand
your
brief.
if
there
were
no
private
organization,
if
trial
judge
says
well,
it
is
just
too
bad,
we
are
not
going
to
appoint
counsel...
that
would
be
constitutional,
i
think,
under
your
view.
justice
stevens
well,
you
have
just
described
two
ways
in
which
prisoners
in
death
cases
have
in
fact
gotten
representation
in
collateral
proceedings,
one
by
the
volunteer
organization,
and
two
by
the
judges
on
occasion
appointing
counsel.
and
i
am
suggesting
that
under
your
view
of
the
constitution,
that
was
not
at
all
necessary.
the
judge,
if
there
were
no
volunteer
organization,
and
if
the
judges
never
appointed
counsel,
you
would
say,
that
is
just
too
bad.
i
think
that
is
your
position.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
and
it
would
be
perfectly
consistent
with
the
constitution
to
have
all
collateral
proceedings
by
prisoners
in
virginia
handled
by
the
prisoner
himself.
justice
stevens
and
anything
beyond
that
is
simply
a
matter
of
grace,
in
your
view?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
but
do
you
think
those
lawyers
are
constitutionally
required,
or
is
this
again
just
something
that
virginia
does
as
a
matter
of
generosity?
justice
stevens
my
question
is,
do
you
think
virginia
could
have
chosen
otherwise?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one
other
question
on
this
notion
of
finality?
no
matter
what
you
do,
it
seems
in
these
death
cases
that
sooner
or
later
somebody
does
file
a
collateral
proceeding,
and
even...
it
has
happened
in
almost
every
death
case
that
i
am
familiar
with,
anyway.
it
is
very
rare
that
you
do
not
have
these
proceedings.
i
am
just
wondering
if
you
did
have
a
procedure
whereby
you
automatically
appointed
counsel
promptly.
don't
you
think
that
might
tend
to
accelerate
the
disposition
of
these
proceedings,
rather
than
waiting
until
the
inmate
can
put
together
the
kind
of
papers
that
they
generally
institute
these
proceedings
with?
justice
stevens
well,
i
was
thinking
a
little
bit
ahead.
the
papers
suggest
that
the
volunteer
system
is
on
the
verge
of
breaking
down.
i
do
not
know.
i
understand
there
are
quite
a
few
virginia
lawyers
who
work
very
hard
in
some
of
these
cases,
and
there
is
not
an
inexhaustible
supply
of
counsel
who
will
take
the
cases
without
being
paid.
i
was
just
thinking,
if
this
system
does
break
down,
you
may
actually
find
yourselves
creating
a
system
that
might
have
more
delay
built
into
it
than
if
you
had
prompt
and
automatic
appointment.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
on
these
appointments
by
the
trial
judges,
pursuant
to
this
discretionary
authority,
are
counsel
compensated
in
the
same
way
as
they
are
in
the
original
trial
itself?
justice
stevens
but
it
is
the
same
procedure,
basically,
as
it
is
for
the
trial
itself?
justice
stevens
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
most
of
the
inmates
have
instead
used
the
volunteer
organization,
have
they
not?
justice
stevens
and
what
happened
in
the
third?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
mr.
zerkin,
before
i
lose
the
thread
of
your
thought,
you
never
did
tell
us
what
happens
in
this
last
15
days.
justice
stevens
mr.
harris,
can
i
ask
you,
this
problem
of
delay
troubles
everyone
interested
in
this
area.
you
say
that
the
average
time
in
virginia
is
eight
months
for
a
direct
review
to
be
completed,
and
then
there
is
apparently
another
additional
six
years
that
takes
place
between
the
completion
of
direct
review
and
the
actual
execution?
justice
stevens
what,
in
your
judgment,
causes
that
delay?
do
those
two
or
three
years
go
by
before
the
first
state
collateral
proceeding
starts?
justice
stevens
so
then
it
is
about
seven
or
so
years
between
the
filing
of
the
first
state
collateral
proceeding
and
the
conclusion
of
both
that
proceeding
and
whatever
federal
proceedings
there
are?
justice
stevens
is
one
part
of
the
proceeding
more
slow,
more
difficult
to
conclude
than
another,
do
you
know?
justice
stevens
in
some
states,
it
is
the
direct
review
that
is
very
slow.
in
some
states
you
could
wait
several
years
before
the
conviction
is
confirmed.
but
in
virginia,
it
is
just
eight
months.
that
is
very
interesting.
justice
stevens
they
start
the
first
proceeding
promptly,
and
it
still
takes
six
years?
justice
stevens
i
suppose
we
have
to
look
at
the
experience
in
other
states...
a
lot
of
states
do
provide
counsel
in
this
proceeding...
and
see
if
they
have
in
fact
been
slowed
up
by
the
process
you
described.
justice
stevens
i
do
not
understand
that.
you
say
that
they
have
had
counsel...
but
why
will
you
get
more
delay
if
you
just
have
different
counsel?
that
is
really
all
you
are
talking
about.
justice
stevens
well,
all
i
am
saying
is
that
is
true
in
a
lot
of
other
states
right
now.
it
is
maybe
not
constitutionally
compelled,
but
these
other
states,
like
florida,
and
some
of
the
others,
do
provide
counsel
for
collateral
review.
and
you
are
suggesting
that
those
states
are...
statistics
will
show
that
those
states
are
a
lot
slower
than
virginia,
because
they
have
this
extra
right?
justice
stevens
well,
they
have
that...
why
do
they
not
have
that
in
florida?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
am
just
saying,
under
your
argument,
it
must
be
true
that
florida
has
a
lot
more
delay
than
virginia
does,
because
they
have
this
extra
right.
it
is
a
state-created
right.
justice
stevens
i
do
not
know
why
it
is
not
a
state-created
remedy
there,
any
more
than
it
would
be
here.
i
do
not
understand
your
argument,
i
guess.
i
gather
that
you
are
saying
that
florida
gives
you
a
right
to
counsel,
but
if
you
do
not
get
that
right,
you
cannot
complain
about
it?
justice
stevens
yes.
