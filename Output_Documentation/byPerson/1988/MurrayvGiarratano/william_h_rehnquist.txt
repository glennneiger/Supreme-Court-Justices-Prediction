chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
no.
85-411,
edward
w.
murray
versus
joseph
m.
giarratano.
mr.
harris,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
you
talking
just
about
capital
cases,
or
about
all
collateral
review?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
the
trial
court
has
discretion
to
grant
or
deny
such
a
petition,
i
take
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
harris,
you
may
save
the
rest
of
your
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
zerkin?
chief
justice
rehnquist
which
gave
each
of
them
a
right
to
counsel?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
is
the
difference
between
that
and
a
right
to
counsel?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
is
the
difference
between
saying
that
you
do
not
have
a
right
to
counsel,
or
in
saying
that
you
do
not
have
a
right
to
the
kind
of
attorney
that
is
to
be
appointed
for
you
in
this
case?
what
is
the
difference?
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
do
you
know
it
is
not
enforceable
in
the
new
habeas
proceeding?
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
some
other
district
court
in
north
carolina
were
to
reach
different
conclusions,
death
row
inmates
in
north
carolina
would
not
have
any
right
to
counsel.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
can
you
answer
my
question?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
look.
i
asked
you
a
question
that
i
think
is
capable
of
being
answered
by
yes
or
no.
please
try
to
answer
it
that
way.
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
a
district
court
hearing
evidence
in
north
carolina
had
reached
a
different
conclusion
than
the
district
court
in
the
eastern
district
of
virginia,
and
said
no,
there
is
not
any
right
to
counsel
of
the
sort
that
judge
merhige
found,
then
the
rule
in
north
carolina
would
be
different
than
the
rule
in
virginia.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
supposing
the
district
court
in
north
carolina
said
we
think
it
is
enough
that
there
are
law
libraries
like
bounds
required
at
the
institutions...
even
in
the
case
of
death
penalty
inmates...
so
we
do
not
think
there
is
any
necessity
for
having
appointed
counsel.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you
would
have
a
right
to
counsel
in
virginia,
but
not
in
north
carolina?
chief
justice
rehnquist
we
will
resume
there
at
one
o'clock.
0
[recess.]
mr.
zerkin,
you
say
resume.
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
you
found
that
the
order
was
being
violated,
then
i
suppose
all
capital
sentences
would
be
stayed?
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
would
you
define
"immediately
facing
execution"?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
zerkin.
mr.
harris,
you
have
seven
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
pended
in
the
district
court
for
five
years?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
harris.
the
case
is
submitted.
