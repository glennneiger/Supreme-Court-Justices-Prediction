justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
exclude
news
stories
and
editorials,
what
kind
of
a...
what
have
you
got
left?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
was...
these
were
just
separate
lists
mailed...
sent
through
the
mails
to
addressees.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but...
but
i
thought
the
ads
were
already
out
of
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
buy
space
in
the
newspaper
to
publish
your
prize
list,
isn't
that
an
ad?
justice
byron
r.
white
where?
where
do
you
have
it?
how
did
it
come
into
existence...
this
thing
you're
talking
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
would
be
mailings
of
prize
lists
that
don't
appear
in
the
newspapers,
for
example,
but
there
could
be
prize
lists,
i
take
it,
that
would
be
in
the
newspaper
that
you
think
the
prize
list
clause
would
cover.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
think...
that's
pretty
fine.
that's
a
pretty
fine...
i
can
understand
that
the
prize
list
clause
would
surely
cover
mailings
of
prize
lists
and
circulars
to
a
bunch
of
addressees.
there's
no
doubt...
not
much
question
about
that,
but
i
suppose
the
prize
list
clause,
since
it
has
been
declared
invalid
on
its
face,
couldn't
even
reach
those
circulars.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
if
the...
if
there's
a
news
story
on
the
front
page
of
the
paper
saying
here
is...
here
are
the
prizes
that
this
new
lottery
will
offer.
it
tells
about
the
lottery
starting
up
and
who
is
sponsoring
it.
it's
a
news
story.
then
they
have
a...
they
have
the
very
list
that
you
find
in
the
back
of
the
paper
that
has
been
paid
for
in
this
news
story.
you
say
that...
that
is
not
covered
by
the
prize
list.
justice
byron
r.
white
well--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
not...
not
events.
this
is...
they're
reporting
what
you
can
win
in
the
lottery.
justice
byron
r.
white
here's
the
list.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
a
news
story
that
says...
a
news
story
that
sums
up
and
makes
a
great
list
of
the
prizes
that
have
been
won
in
the
last
year
in
the
lottery.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
covered.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you've
already
got
some...
some
coverage
for
the
prize...
for
the
prize
clause:
circulars.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i...
it
seems
to
me
that...
i
don't
know
why
you
care
whether
it's
an
ad
or
not.
the
ad...
the
ad
provision
has
been
sustained,
and
if
all...
if
all
non-editorial
prize
lists
in
a
paper
are
ads,
there's
no
problem.
but
i
take
it
you
concede
that
if
the
prize
list
is
read
to
cover
editorial
prize
lists,
it's
unconstitutional.
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
uh-hum.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all
right.
and
so,
what's
the
big
problem
in
the
case?
if
it
covers...
if
it
covers
editorials...
editorial
prize
lists,
it's
bad.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
it
covers
paid-for
prize
lists,
and...
and
if
the
ads...
the
ad
provision
covers
paid-for
prize
lists,
it's
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
don't
you...
why
don't
you
defend
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
government
concedes
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
--the
government
concedes
that
if
you
construe
it
to
cover
that,
it's
unconstitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
want
that
vacated?
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
left
of
the
prize
clause
that
if
you
eliminate
news
stories
and
editorials?
justice
byron
r.
white
--what
about...
what
about
a
so-called
lottery
newspaper,
a
lottery
publishes
a
newspaper
or
a
newspaper
runs
a
lottery,
whichever
one
you
want
to
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
didn't
the
newspaper,
though,
take
the
position
that
the...
that
the
prize
clause
was
unconstitutional
on
its
face?
didn't
they
ask
for
a
judgment
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
don't
think
there
was
any
case
or
controversy
before
the
court
on
non-editorial
prize
lists.
justice
byron
r.
white
well...
well--
--well,
that's
right.
it's--
--but
i...
but
why
should
that
part
of
the
judgment...
if
you
don't
want
to
defend
that
or
attack
that
judgment,
why
shouldn't
that
part
of
the
judgment...
why
should
that
be
vacated?
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
so,
the...
that...
the
the
advertising
clause...
the
judgment
upholding
that
stands.
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
well,
but
in...
in
fact,
you...
you
don't...
the
only
reason
it's
out
of
the
case
is
not
because
you
agree
with
the
government
on
it,
but
because
you
are
affected
by
that
decision
for
one
year
until
the
new
statute
comes
into
effect.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
judgment
stands.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
not
try
to
define
or
redefine
commercial
speech?
