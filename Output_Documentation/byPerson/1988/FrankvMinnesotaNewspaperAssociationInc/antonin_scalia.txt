justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
we
know
that?
i
mean,
you
know,
it...
very
often
congress
is
concerned
about
one
particular
aspect
of
a
problem,
and
it
drafts
a
statute
that
covers
that,
but
to
be
prophylactic
covers
a
few
things
beyond
that
as
well.
i
have
no
confidence
at
all
that
if
you
asked
one
of
those
original
legislators,
well,
what
if...
what
if
a
newspaper
just
wrote
a
news
story,
not
an
advertisement,
just
a
news
story,
said,
look
it,
these
are
the
great
money
prizes
that
you
can
get
in
the
louisiana
lottery,
i
think
it's
quite
plausible
that
that
senator
would
have
said,
yes,
i
think...
don't
like
that
any
better.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are...
you
are
dealing
in
an
anachronism
here.
you're...
you're
casting
back
upon
the
1890
congress
our
modern
notion
of
commercial
speech.
they
didn't
know
about
the
distinction
between
commercial
speech
and
other
speech.
we've
invented
that
in
recent
years.
and
why
should
i
ever
think
that
they
had
it
in
mind
in
1890?
justice
antonin
scalia
concerned
about
their
being
promoted
commercially
or
otherwise.
why...
why
should
i
think
they
were
just
concerned
about
their
being
commercially
promoted?
to
be
sure,
that
was
the
main
way
they
were
promoted,
but
i
have
no
basis
for
thinking
that
they
wouldn't
have
been
concerned
about
their
being
promoted
in
any
fashion,
commercially
or
otherwise.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
larkin,
suppose
i
disagree
with
you.
suppose
i
think
it
means
what
it
says
and...
and
why...
why
couldn't
i
say
that
it's
valid
as
applied
to
all...
all
commercial
speech
and
not
valid
as
applied
to
other
speech?
why
couldn't
i
handle
the
problem
that
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i'm
saying
it's
written
to
apply
to
everything,
but
it's...
it's
unconstitutional
insofar
as
it
extends
beyond
commercial
speech.
why
can't
i
say
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
why
couldn't
we
adopt
a
new
rule
that
in
addition
to
being
substantially
overbroad...
if
it's
overbroad
in
a
fashion
that
can
be
limited
very
clearly,
as
most...
most
overbroad
statutes
can,
where
the
only
overbreadth
consists
of
extending
beyond
commercial
speech.
it's
a
very
clear
line
that
you
can
make
by
judicial
decision.
why
couldn't
i
hold
that
a
facial
challenge
can
be
rejected
if
the
only
overbreadth
consists
of
going
beyond
commercial?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
larkin,
i'm
not
sure
you
have
circulars.
i...
i
don't...
i
don't
agree
with
your...
your
answer
to
justice
white
on
that.
the
first
clause
of
1302
covers
any
letter,
package,
postal
card
or
circular
concerning
any
lottery.
that
first
clause
would
cover
a
list
of
prizes
put
into
an
envelope
with
a
stamp
on
it
and
sent.
that
would
be
a
circular
concerning
any
lottery
whether
it's
an
advertisement
or
a
list
of
prizes
or
anything
else.
the
clause
we're
talking
about
here
only,
i
believe,
deals
with
material
that
is
not
inserted
into
an
envelope,
but
that
goes
as
a
general
publication
to
the
general
public,
newspaper,
circular,
pamphlet
or
publication
of
any
kind.
i
think
they
mean
to
distinguish
between
a
publication
and
the
kind
of
circulars
that
are...
that
are
mailed
to...
to
individuals.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
the
meaning
of
the
first
clause
if...
if
you're
reading
this
one
the
way
you
do
to
cover
something
put
into
an
envelope
to
a
private
individual.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
doesn't
that
leave
justice
white's
question
still
on
the
table
then?
what
does
it
cover
besides...
besides
advertisements?
isn't
that
kind
of
a
prize
list
an
advertisement?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
just...
you
just
say,
well,
we
don't
care
anymore.
it
isn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
not
that
you're
in
legal
agreement
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it's...
and
it's
not
that
you're
not
affected
by
it.
you
are
affected
by
it.
you
just
don't...
you
just
now
no
longer
want
to
litigate
over...
over
that
effect.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
that
marbury
v.
madison
would
have
come
out
differently
on
that
kind
of
a
theory.
the
difficult
constitutional
question
of
whether
a
mandamus
could
have
applied
to
a...
to
a
cabinet
officer
being
so
difficult
and
congress
not
having
explicitly
said
in
the
statute
at
issue
whether
mandamus
would
apply
to
a
high
level
cabinet
officer,
we
wouldn't
have
reached
the
issue,
would
we?
we...
we
would
have
just
said
this
statute
does
not
apply
to
cabinet
officers.
justice
antonin
scalia
boy,
it's
going
to
change
a
lot
of
our
law,
isn't
it?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
vacate
or
do
we...
do
we
remand
with
instructions
as...
as
we
did
in
the
case...
what
was
it...
deakins,
the
case
you
cite
to
support--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we...
we
directed
the...
the
court
to
dismiss
with
prejudice.
is
that...
is
that
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
dismissal
with
prejudice
sounds
worse
to
me,
don't
you
think?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
sounds
a
little
worse.
[laughter]
but
that's
what
we
did
in--
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
clear
that
you
want
this
case
off
our
docket,
though.
right?
[laughter]
