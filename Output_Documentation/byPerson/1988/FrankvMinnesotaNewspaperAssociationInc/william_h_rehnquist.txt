chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
87-1956,
anthony
m.
frank,
postmaster
general
v.
the
minnesota
newspaper
association.
mr.
larkin?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
just
how
were
the
prize
lists...
they
were...
were
they
a
flyer
in
the
newspaper
or
reprinted
on
some
page
of
the
newspaper?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
tell...
tell
us
again
what
the
prize
list
clause
covers
that
the
advertising
clause
doesn't
cover.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
now...
now,
wait
a
minute.
why
does...
why
is
the
first
example
you
mention
that
you
say
is
covered
by
the
prize
list
clause
but
not
by
the
advertising
clause...
why
isn't
that
covered
by
the
advertising
clause?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
exactly.
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out
is
what
the
prize
list
clause
reaches
that
the
advertising
clause
doesn't
reach.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why
wouldn't
the
advertising
clause
cover
a
prize
list
that
appears
in
a
newspaper
and
is
paid
for
by
some
sponsor?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
but
the
newspapers
here
don't
plan
to
do
that.
there's
no
indication
that
they
are
going
to
do
that,
is
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
larkin.
mr.
devore?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
we
were
to
conclude
for
one
reason
or
another,
mr.
devore,
that
the
statute
should
be
construed
to
cover
only
the
sort
of
commercial
speech
that
you've
adverted
to
and
mr.
larkin
has
adverted
to?
what...
what
does...
what
does
that
do
to
the
judgment
here?
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
is...
is
too
broad.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you
say
that
all
you're
asking
for
is
the
sort
of
relief
that
will
exclude
newspaper
stories
about
lotteries,
which
the
government
concedes
the
statute
doesn't
cover.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
therefore,
the...
the
district
court
went
too
far--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
that
we
should
not
go
beyond
what
you've
asked
for
and
construe
the
statute
other
than
it's
saying
it
does
not
apply
to
what
you're
trying
to
do.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
try
this
case
below,
mr.
devore?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
you
say
the
judgment
stands,
let
me--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you
have
dismissed
your
appeal.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
so,
it's
stands
simply
because
there
was
an
adverse
judgment
entered
in
the
district
court
to
you
and
you
have
not
appealed
from
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
i
don't
think
we're
quite
as
limited
as
you
suggest
in
the
extent
to
which
we
can
review
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
the
district
court
held
the
statute
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
the
government
has
appealed
from
that
ruling.
and
the
fact
that
you
don't
see...
that
the
sort
of
construction
which
the
government
wants
to
put
on
it
to
save
it
from
being
held
unconstitutional
on
its
face
would
not
hurt
you
doesn't
at
this
stage
of
the
litigation
mean
that
we
couldn't
write
an
opinion,
it
seems
to
me,
upholding
the
government's
position
and
still
not
hurt
you
in
any
way.
that
would
mean
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
would
be
reversed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
and
of
course
we
write
lots
of
opinions
to
which
counsel
do
have
objection.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
devore.
mr.
larkin,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
larkin.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
frank
versus
minnesota
newspaper
association.
the
minnesota
newspaper
association
sued
in
federal
court
in
minnesota
to
prevent
the
postmaster
general
from
enforcing
a
federal
statute
which
prohibited
the
mailing
of
any
publication
containing
advertisements
for
lotteries
or
list
of
lottery
prizes.
the
district
court
granted
partial
relief
and
both
parties
appealed
to
this
court.
after
we
had
noted
jurisdiction
over
the
appeals,
congress
passed
further
legislation
affecting
the
case.
the
parties
agreed
between
themselves
to
dismiss
the
newspaper
associationâ€™s
appeal.
and
now,
the
newspaper
association
states
its
willingness
to
forego
all
relief
that
it
sought
by
filing
this
suit.
in
a
per
curiam
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
conclude
that
this
stipulation
renders
the
case
moot.
we
therefore
vacate
the
judgment
below
and
remand
for
the
district
court
to
dismiss
the
portions
of
the
complaint
remaining
at
issue
on
this
appeal.
justices
white
and
marshall
dissent
and
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
separate
dissent.
