well,
i
thought
the
newspapers
had
also
asked
to
invalidate
the...
the
requirement
concerning
ads.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
more
was
asked
below--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--than
we
have
before
us
now.
so--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
yes,
that's
their
revenue.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
was
what
they
were
in
there
to
litigate.
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
issue
is
now
out
of
the
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
sounds
like
you'd
be
satisfied
if
we
vacated,
reversed
or
affirmed.
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
would
reach
the
result
you
would
be
happy
with.
