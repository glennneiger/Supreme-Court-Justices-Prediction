but,
mr.
larkin,
i'm
still
a
little
puzzled.
those
lists
were
not
sent
out
in
newspapers,
were
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
yes,
but...
but
now
they
have
to
pay
to
do
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
it's
an
ad.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
have
you
got
an
example
anywhere
in
the
world
of
such
a
list
being
published
by
a
newspaper
without...
when
it
was
paid
for
and
it
was
not
an
ad?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
wasn't
in
a
newspaper.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood.
