mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
facial
constitutionality
under
the
first
amendment
of
a
provision
of
the
anti-lottery
act
of
1890,
an
act
of
congress
that
has
been
on
the
books
for
99
years,
and
it
has
already
been
upheld
by
this
court
over
a
first
amendment
challenge.
the
anti-lottery
act
of
1890
contains
two
clauses
that
are
relevant
here:
an
advertisement
clause
and
a
prize
list
clause.
the
advertisement
clause
prohibits
sending
advertisements
through
the
mail.
the
prize
list
clause
prohibits
sending
through
the
mail
lists
of
prizes
drawn
or
awarded
by
the
lotteries.
now,
this
case,
however,
is
now
smaller
in
scope
than
it
was
when
the
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction
in
october
and
when
we
filed
our
brief
in
november.
the
district
court
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
advertisement
clause,
but
that
ruling
is
no
longer
before
the
court.
what
is
before
the
court
is
the
district
court's
ruling
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
prize
list
clause.
the
district
court
held
that
clause
unconstitutional
on
its
face
on
the
ground
that
it
was
designed
to
and
would
prevent
a
distribution
through
the
mails
of
news
stories
that
contained
lists
of
prizes
awarded
by
a
lottery.
what
remains
in
this
case
in
our
view
still
presents
a
live
controversy
between
the
parties.
that
controversy
can
be
decided
on
the
record
as
it
now
stands,
and
that
controversy
can
be
resolved
in
our
favor
essentially
by
relying
on
this
court's
precedents.
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed
for
two
reasons
which
i
will
summarize.
first,
the
district
court
misread
the
scope
of
the
prize
list
clause.
this
court
in
the
horner
case
held
that
a
prize
list
used
in
the
commercial
promotion
of
a
lottery
fit
within
the
term
"prize
list"
in
the
statute.
in
our
view
that
is
also
as
far
as
the
statute
reaches.
in
other
words,
the
prize
list
clause
does
not
apply
to
news
stories,
editorials
or
similar
types
of
commentary.
it
applies
only
to
what
today
would
be
called
commercial
speech.
second,
when
the
prize
list
clause
is
construed
in
that
manner,
it
is
facially
constitutional
under
this
court's
decisions
in
ex
parte
jackson,
in
re
rapler
and
posadas.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
what
you
have
left,
your
honor,
is
the
type
of
prize
list
that
this
court
addressed
in
the
horner
case,
and
that
shows
up
in
some
of
the
examples
we've
reprinted
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
in
the
appendix
to
our
opening
brief,
we've
reprinted
several
examples
of
what
were
prize
lists
that
were
distributed
during
the
period
before
this
act
became
law.
if
you
look
to
page
11a
to
12a,
you'll
see
an
advertisement
that
was
distributed
in
behalf
of
the
louisiana
lottery,
which
was
the
most
famous
or
infamous
lottery
in
the
19th
century.
if
you
look
to
the
top
of
page
12a,
you
will
see
a
section
entitled
"list
of
prizes".
at
page
14a
in
the
appendix
is
another
prize
list,
this
one
distributed
on
behalf
of
the
kentucky
lottery.
now,
those
examples
we
think
are
important
because
that
is
what
this
court
construed
the
act
to
cover
in
the
horner
case.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
correct.
they
could
be
put...
put
out
by
lotteries
by
purchasing
advertising
space
or
space
for
the
promotion
of
a
prize
list
in
a
newspaper.
and
then
the
newspaper
was
sent
out
across
the
country.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
the...
the...
the
constitutionality
of
the
advertisement
clause
is
out
of
the
case.
you're
correct.
but
what
is
in--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--not
necessarily,
no,
because
congress
adopted
two
different
clauses
in
the
statute
because
i
think
it
saw
that
there
were
two
different
types
of
promotional
materials
being
used.
the
types
of
promotional
materials
you
see
here
that
would
constitute
a
prize
list
is
the
same
type
of
promotional
material
the
court
addressed
in
the
horner
case.
we
have
reprinted
in
our
brief
at
page
30,
footnote
27,
what
this
court
addressed
in
the
horner
case.
the
prize
list
that
is
reprinted
at
that
part
of
our
brief
is
the
same
as
the
ones
here.
what
was
happening
in
the
19th
century
was
that
you
had
two
different
types
basically
of
promotional
materials
being
used.
you
had
an
advertisement
that
didn't
include
the
lists
of
what
could
be
awarded.
that,
for
example,
is
at
page
13a
of
our
appendix.
and
then
you
had
other
types
of
promotional
materials
that
basically
just
consisted
of
a
list
of
what
the
lottery
would
award.
congress
drafted
the
statute
to
include
both
types
of
materials.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
they
could
be,
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
yes.
and
if
they
pay
to
do
it--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--no,
it
would
not
necessarily
be
an
add.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
the
one
we've
reprinted
at
pages
11a
to
12a,
the
one
from
the
louisiana
lottery,
was
called
an
ad
by
the
postal
service
at
the
time,
but
it
contained
a
list
of
prizes.
you
could--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--yes,
it
was.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
see,
both
of
these
types
of
promotional
materials...
the
one
we
have,
for
example,
at
page
13a,
which
is
just
basically
a
little
flyer
about
the
louisiana
lottery
would
be
seen
as
an
advertisement
in
the
period,
like
letting
people
know
the
lottery
existed.
and
then
you
had
other
types
of
promotional
materials
that
told
them
the
prizes
you
could
actually
win
if
you
entered.
and
congress
drafted
the
statute
to
include
both.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
they...
they
could
occur
in
both
ways.
for
example,
at
the
time
some
lotteries
in
the
19th
century
actually
tried
to
take
advantage
of
the
loophole
in
the
1876
act
by
publishing
their
own
lottery
newspapers.
for
example,
the
postal...
the
postmaster
general
pointed
that
out
to
congress
when
they
were
considering
this
statute.
so,
in
that
case
what
you
could
have
is
the,
say,
kentucky
lottery
newspaper
that
was
being
printed,
and
you
could
have
reprinted
as
the
same
way
you
have
advertisements
at
grocery
stores
nowadays
an
advertisement
about
the
lottery
or
list
of
the
prizes
that
the
lottery
was
going
to
award.
you
also
could
have
the
situation
in
which
even
if
it
wasn't
a
newspaper
that
was
sponsored
by
the
lottery
itself,
the...
the
lottery
could
purchase
space
in
the
newspaper
to
reprint
the
advertisement
or
the
prize
list.
let
me
explain
some
of
the
background
to
this,
and
it
may
help
answer
your
question.
in
the
19th
century,
gambling,
particularly
lotteries,
were
treated
with
the
same
contempt
that
narcotics
trafficking
is
today.
that's
clear
not
only
from
the
materials
that
were
before
congress,
the
statements
by
presidents
of
the
united
states,
but
from
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
absolutely.
and,
in
fact,
it
was
that
reason
that
they
were
used
by
the
louisiana
lottery
because
they
were...
they
were
asked
by
the
louisiana
lottery
to...
to
lend
their
name
to
this
enterprise
in
order
to
add
an
air
of
respectability
to
it.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
correct.
but,
nonetheless,
it
was
the
louisiana
lottery
that
ultimately
was
the
target
of
this
statute.
by
1890,
after
a
nationwide
effort
extending
over
several
decades,
most
states...
in
fact,
every
state
except
louisiana...
had
prohibited
this
type
of
activity.
louisiana
allowed
the
louisiana
lottery
to
engage
in
business,
however,
and
it
engaged
in
business
on
a
nationwide
scale
and
made
an
enormous
amount
of
money
as
a
result.
it
engaged
in
business
on
a
nationwide
scale
by
putting
advertisements
and
other
types
of
promotional
materials
in
newspapers,
and
the
reason
it
put
those
materials
in
newspapers
is
that
the
existing
1876
law
that
this
court
upheld
in
the
jackson
case
did
not
apply
to
newspapers.
the
result
was
there
was
no
existing
way
at
that
time
for
any
of
the
other
states
in
the
nation
or
congress...
excuse
me...
or
the
executive
to
do
anything
about
the
existence
of
the
louisiana
lottery.
however,
congress
decided
it
was
time
to
shut
it
down.
it
decided
that
the
only
way
effectively
to
do
so
was
to
deny
the
louisiana
lottery
access
to
its
primary
source
of
income
which
was
money
from
out-of-state
bettors
since
the
louisiana
lottery
received
more
than
90
percent
of
its
income
from
out-of-state
bettors.
the
result
of
that
was
the
anti-lottery
act
of
1890.
congress
passed
that
law
in
order
to
deny
the
louisiana
lottery
the
opportunity
to
use
newspapers
for...
for
promoting
their
own
financial
success.
it
was
that
type
of
prize
list
or
that
type
of
advertisement
that
congress
was
concerned
about.
congress
was
not
intending
to
prevent
a
newspaper
from
writing
a
news
story
about
a
lottery,
about
a
lottery
winner
or
about
a
lottery
prize
list.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
i
have
several--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--i
don't
suggest
that
the
congress
that
passed
this
statute
was
thinking
in
terms
of
the...
you
know,
the
four-part
central
hudson
test
or
any
of
the
other
cases
that
this
court
has
decided.
but
what
i
do
say
is
this.
congress
passed
this
statute
to
prevent
lotteries
from
being
commercially
promoted.
that
purpose
dovetails
nicely
we
think
with
the
commercial
speech
doctrine
the
court
has
today,
and
we
think
that
is
what
they
were
concerned
about.
you
didn't
have
news
stories
about
lotteries
then
because--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
it's
possible
that
if
you
had
a
different
set
of
facts
before
congress,
they
would
have
been
concerned
about
that.
but
you
didn't
have
news
stories
about
lotteries
because
there
was
only
one
state,
louisiana,
where
they
were
lawful.
and
newspapers
themselves
supported
this
act.
congress
certainly
believed
that
the
majority
of
newspapers
supported
the
legislation
that
it
was
putting
forward,
and
i
doubt
the
newspapers
themselves
would
have
supported
this
act
if
they
thought
it
was
going
to
censure
their
ability
to
report
about
stories.
congress
dealt
with
a
particular
problem,
and
it's
the
goal
that
congress
had
in
mind,
the
purpose
of
that
statute,
that
should
influence
the
construction
here,
and
that
is
so
even
apart
from
the
concerns
expressed
in
cases
like
catholic
bishop
about
construing
statutes
in
order
for
them
to
be
constitutional.
we
don't
think
congress,
which
debated
the
constitutionality
of
this
type
of
statute
under
the
law
that
the
court
had
set
forth
in
the
jackson
case,
intended
this
type
of
statute
here
to
reach
more
broadly.
congress
certainly
hasn't
shown
any
indication
of
intending
in
more
recent
times
that
the
statute
be
read
that
broadly.
the
statute
was
revisited
in
1974.
the
statute
was
revisited
last
year,
and
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
congress
is
not
aware
of
what
the
historic
construction
is.
in
fact,
justice
scalla,
there
is
no
hint
in
this
court's
opinion
in
the
rapler
case,
which
was
decided
two
years
after
the
statute
was
passed,
or
in
the
horner
case,
which
was
decided
three
years
after
the
statute
was
passed,
that
this
act
applied
to
news
stories.
and
the
people
on
this
court
at
that
time
were
certainly
aware
of
what
the
statute
was
designed
to
deal
with.
as
i
said,
lotteries
in
the
19th
century
were
as
well-known
and
as
despised
as
narcotics
trafficking
is
today.
the
fact
that
this
court
twice
at
that
early
stage
didn't
hesitate
to
even
ask
the
question
whether
it
applied
to
news
stories
i
think
is
significant
evidence
that
the
statute
doesn't
reach
that--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
if
the
statute
is
limited
so
that
it
applies
only
to
commercial
speech--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
the
statute
still
cannot
be
held
facially
unconstitutional,
which
is
the
ruling
below,
the
one
we
are
challenging,
unless
it
is
substantially
overbroad,
and
we
don't
think
it
meets
that
test.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
we
think
you
can,
and
we
ask
in
this
case
for
the
district
court's
judgment
which
dealt
only
with
the
facial
constitutionality
of
the
statute
to
be
reversed.
if
there
are
problems
of
the
type
that
are
concerning
you,
those
problems
can
be
worked
out
when
the
statute
is
applied
in
particular
cases.
that's
what
an
as-applied
type
of
challenge
is
for.
but
the
district
court
held
the
statute
facially
invalid.
we
have
argued
that
the
statute
should
be
construed
to
be
limited
to
lotteries...
excuse
me...
to
prize
lists
used
commercially
to
promote
lotteries.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
the
prize
list
clause
covers
circumstances
in
which
you
offer
a
prize
in...
for
entry
in
the
lottery,
and
the
advertising
clause
covers
other
types
of
commercial
promotion.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
it...
there
is
some
overlap
between
the
two.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
the
prize
list
clause
would
reach
the
case
where
you
just
basically
have
the
list
of
prizes
that
the
lottery
is
being...
that
the
lottery
is
offering,
perhaps
with
the
title
of
the
lottery,
like
the--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
prize
lists
were...
were
used
in
circulars
and
other
types
of
promotional
materials.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
yes,
i
agree
with
your
honor.
the
prize
list
clause
could
apply
to
newspapers
and
to
other
types
of
circulars.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
because
we
don't
think
congress
intended
the
prize...
excuse
me...
the
advertisement
clause
just
to
be
limited...
to
reach
in
that
manner.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
in
adopting
a...
well,
by
adopting
a
separate
prize
list
clause,
it
seems
that
congress
thought
it
was
dealing
with
two
somewhat
overlapping
but,
nonetheless,
somewhat
distinct
types
of
promotional
materials.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that's
right.
the
district
court's
judgment
wouldn't
allow
the
prize
list
clause
to
be
applied
in
any
manner
to
circulars,
to
newspaper
stories,
to
even
illegal
uses
of
a
lottery,
such
as
a
numbers
racket.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
no,
a
bona
fide
news
story
is
not.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
we
don't
think
that
the
statute
should
be
read
to
prevent
the
press
from
reporting
about
factual
events
and--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--that's
right.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
it's
an
event
to
occur
in
the
future
and
we
don't
think
that
the
prize
list
clause
properly
construed
should
apply
to
simple,
straightforward
news
stories
in
the
manner--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--correct.
if
the
lottery
purchases
the
space
in
the
newspaper
to
list
all
the
prizes
they
have
awarded
in
the
past
10
years,
to
list
all
the
prizes
that
they
are
going
to
award--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--that
would
be
covered.
if
the
newspaper
sells
the
advertising
space,
that
would
be
covered.
but
if
the
newspaper
on
its
own
prints
a
story
either
because
it
thinks
its
newsworthy
or
because
it
wants
to
just
let
the
public
play
in
the
lottery
by
telling
them
about
it,
that
wouldn't
be
covered.
mr.
paul

correct.
if
it's
just
a
list
of
prizes
and,
say,
the
name
of
the
lottery,
i
don't
think
congress
thought
that
that
was
an
advertisement.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
we're
trying
to
be
faithful
to
this
fact
that
there
are
two
separate
clauses
in
the
statute,
and--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--that's
right,
but
we
think
if
you
use
the
same
material
that
goes
in
the
circular
in
a
newspaper,
it
would
be
covered
there
too.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
let...
let
me
explain
then
if...
the
difference
here
between
the
two.
the
circular
part
of
the
statute
to
which
you
were
referring
was
part
of
the
original
1876
law.
the
part
of
the
statute
that
includes
the
prize
list
phrase
was
the
part
that
was
added
by
the
1890
law
that
was
designed
to
deal
with
newspapers.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that's
right.
so,
when
i
was
answering
justice
white's
question,
what
i
was
trying
to
say
was
you
could
have
prize
lists
that
show
up
in
circulars
because
that's
what
happened
in
the
horner
case.
but
the
part
of
the
statute
that
you
have
at
issue
under
the
district
court's
judgment
is
the
part
of
the
statute
that's
designed
to
deal
with
newspapers.
so,
as
a
factual
historical
matter,
you
could
have
a
prize
list
show
up
in
a
circular.
and
the
circular
clause
that
you
mentioned
would
cover
it.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
but
when
the
prize
list
shows
up
in
the
newspaper,
then
it
is
covered
by
the
clause
that
we're
dealing
with
here
because
that
was
part
of
the
1890--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--i
don't
think
so
if
it's
just
simply
the
list
of
the
prizes
they
are
going
to
award,
congress
must
have
thought
that
that
was
specifically
addressed
by
the
prize
list
clause
rather
than
the
advertisement
clause.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
if
the
prize
list
clause
is
read
to
apply
to
a
general
news
story?
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
we
would...
we
would
say
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
in
that
respect.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
if--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--but
if
the
newspaper
is
operating
the
lottery
as...
or
is
owned
by
the
lottery,
as
happened
in
the
19th
century,
then
you
don't
have
a
bona
fide
news
story,
and
if
they
just
list
the
prizes,
then
it
would
be
within
the
prize
list
clause.
as
i
tried
to
explain
earlier,
there
were
instances
in
the
19th
century
in
which
a
lottery
published
what
they
called
a
lottery
newspaper,
and
in
that
circumstance,
just
listing
the
prizes
would
not
be
a
bona
fide
news
story
because
it
would
be
used
commercially
to
promote
the
lottery.
in
fact,
if
you
didn't
include
within
the
type
of
commercial
speech
that
we're
talking
about
here
situations
in
which
a
lottery
newspaper
is
covered,
then
you're
creating
an
exemption
that
allows
the
lottery
just
to
print
something
that
they
call
a
lottery
newspaper
and
advertise
their
prize
lists
freely
in
that
manner.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
no,
i
don't...
do
not
believe
so.
but
the
statute
was
held
facially
invalid,
and
for
that
reason
we
think
the
district
court
was
wrong.
if
the
newspapers
in
this
case
became
shareholders
in
a
lottery,
then
you
have
a
different
story,
and
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
or
construction
of
the
statute
should
be
construed
in
that
context.
but
here
the
district
court
held
it
facially
invalid,
and
we
don't
think
it's
facially
invalid.
we
think
it
can
properly
be
applied.
when
it's
read
in
the
manner
that
we
have
suggested
or
when
it's
limited
to
the
types
of
material
that
we
have
said
the
statute
should
be
limited
to,
we
think
the
statute
is
a
lawful
regulation
of
commercial
speech
under
the
jackson,
rapler
and
posadas
cases.
rapler,
for
example,
upheld
this
very
statute,
and
posadas
upheld
a
very
similar
ban
on
casino
gambling.
as
a
matter
of
precedent,
therefore,
we
think
this
statute
passes
muster,
and
we
also
think
that
precedent
makes
good
policy
sense.
what
you
have
here
is
a
situation
in
which
congress
has
attempted
to
deal
with
a
narrow
category
of
materials
such
as
firearms,
alcohol,
cigarettes,
narcotics
or
legalized
prostitution.
these
are
areas
that
government
has
historically
regulated
under
the
morals
head
of
its
police
power.
one
of
the
ways
of
regulating
it
is
to
limit
advertising.
this
court
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
that
judgment
by
congress
a
century
ago.
we
ask
the
court
to
do
so
again
today.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
if
the
court
allowed
them
to
dismiss
their
complaint,
then
there
would
be
no...
there
would
no
longer
be
a
case.
but
they...
they
don't
have
a
right
to
dismiss
their
complaint
because
we
filed
our
answer.
and
we
would
urge
the
court
not
to
grant
the
motion
because
this
part
of
the
statute
was
not
changed
by
the
most
recent
amendments.
the
constitutional
question
presented
here,
therefore,
is
one
that
is
of
practical
importance
to
the
postal
service,
and
that
the
postal
service
would
ask
this
court
to
decide
based
on
the
record
in
our
favor.
thank
you.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
just
a
few
points,
your
honor.
i
think
it
was
justice
o'connor
asked
about
the
scope
of
the
relief
they
asked
for.
the
scope
of
the
relief
they
asked
for
in
district
court
was
not
limited
to
advertisements
and
news
stories.
page
8
of
the
joint
appendix
reprints
their
request,
and
they
ask
the
statute
to
be
held
void
to
the
extent
they
prohibit
or
interfere
with
the
publication
of
information
about
lawful
gaming
activities
regardless
of
the
form.
so,
they
asked
for
the
statute
to
be
held
invalid
insofar
as
it
prevented
them
from
publishing
any
information
about
lawful
gaming
activities,
not
just
advertisements
and
not
just
news
stories.
secondly,
i
don't
think
it
is
we
that
have
changed
our
position
in
this
case.
after
all,
the
appellee
filed
a
motion
to
affirm
in
which
it
asked
this
court
summarily
to
affirm
the
judgment
below.
appellee
has
now
said
that
it
doesn't
mind
if
the
case
is
affirmed,
reversed,
vacated
or
disposed
of
in
some
other
manner.
but
our
construction
of
the
statute
has
been
consistent
throughout.
we
asked
the
district
court
not
to
read
the
statute
to
apply
to
news
stories.
we
ask
the
court
not
to
read
the
statute
that
way
today.
we
ask
the
court
to
uphold
the
statute
in
the
manner
we
have
suggested.
thank
you.
