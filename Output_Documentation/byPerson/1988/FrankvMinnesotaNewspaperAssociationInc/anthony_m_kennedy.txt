justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
example
you
just
gave
is
not
an
ad.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
it
says
this
is
an
advertisement
paid
for
by
the
xyz
lottery
company,
it's
still
not
an
ad.
why
do...
why
do
you
care
whether
it
is
or
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
counsel,
if
the
newspapers
were
willing
to
forego
all
claims
for
equitable
relief
and
to
have
this
judgment
vacated
in...
in
its
entirety,
would
the
case
then
be
moot?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you're
not
willing
to
have
the
entire
judgment
vacated.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
vacate
the
entire
judgment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you're
willing
to
have
entered
here?
