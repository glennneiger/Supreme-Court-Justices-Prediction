mr.
p.
cameron
devore
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government
has
served
up
in
its
briefs
and
in
oral
argument
today
a
number
of
historical
examples
of
historical
prize
lists
which
may
or
may
not
be
real
today,
but
certainly
are
not
things
which
are
before
the
court
in
this
case.
we
submit
that
this
case
if
over,
that
each
side
agrees
that
the
other
is
entitled
to
the
outcome
that
it
seeks,
and
we
ask
the
court
to
close
the
case
on
the
statutory
construction
point.
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
we
are
willing
to
have
the
entire
judgment
vacated,
justice
kennedy,
but
i
think
the
court
in
doing
so
should
explain
the
logic
used
by
the
court
in
reaching
that
point.
and
i
think
you
must
face
the
statutory
construction
point.
the
government
and
we
basically
agree
that
it
is
proper
to
construe
the
statute
not
to
apply
to
fully
protected
speech,
but
i
think
in
order
to...
to...
to
reach
that
point,
you've
got
to
go
through
some
of
the
logic
in
the...
in,
for
example,
catholic
bishop
and
debartolo
from
last
term
to
understand
where
you...
how
you
get
there.
it's
not
the
sort
of
mootness
situation
that
you
find
in
a...
oh,
say,
the
defunis
case
or
others
where
an
intervening
event
has
disposed
of
the
case.
congress
acted
here
and
passed
the
charitable
games
act
and
the
indian
gaming
statute
after
the
court
noted
jurisdiction
on
both
appeals
here.
we
dismissed
our
appeal
on
the
advertising
clause
based
on
that
intervening
event.
the
prize
list
clause
is
all
that's
still
before
the
court.
so,
we
agree
with
the
government
that
the...
the
court
went
too
far
below.
we
didn't
ask
for
a
holding
of
facial
unconstitutionality.
the
district
court
provided
that
because
it
was
apparently
concerned
about
the
reach
that
the
government
argued
for
into
news
and
editorial
fully
protected
speech.
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
well,
i
have...
would
have
no
doubt,
justice
white,
that
if--
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
--this
applied--
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
--they
did
construe
that...
they
did
concede
that
here
today
to
the
court
in
oral
argument.
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
well,
i
would
be
pleased
to
have
a...
an
eloquent
holding
of
the
court
that
an...
another
holding
of
the
court,
because
there
are
many
that
the
court
has
done
in
the
past,
that
a
statute
which
would
purport
to
apply
to
news
and
editorial
copy
would
meet...
would
not
meet
the
strict
scrutiny
test
which
i
think
was
held
by
the
district
court.
the
district
court
just
went
a
little
too
far
in...
in
holding
that
it
was
facially
unconstitutional
and
enjoining
all
applications,
including
applications
not
before
the
court.
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
i'm
not
sure
i
know
the
answer
to
that.
the
government
has
given
some
examples,
possibly...
and
the
example
in
the
horner
case
of
circulars
sent
by
a
lottery
sponsor
to
people
who
were
already
in
the
game
may
well
be
something
that
might
be
covered
by
it.
but
that--
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
--is
certainly
not
an
advertisement
in
a
newspaper.
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
well,
the
issue
there
would
be
one
which
would
still
be
open
to
the
court
if
you
accept
the...
either
holding,
either
that
this
is...
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
the
only
speech
at
issue
in
this
case,
news
and
editorial
copy,
or
you
simply
say
that
as
construed
under
catholic
bishop
and
debartolo,
you
needn't
reach
those
things.
it
would
still
be
open
to
the
postal
service
to
attempt
to
apply
it
in
a
situation.
then
the
court
would
be
confronted
or
a
court
would
be
confronted
with
the
question
of
whether
you
had
commercial
speech
at
all
under
the
tests
of...
you
know,
adduced
by
the
court,
and
then
if
you
had
commercial
speech,
whether
in
fact
the
regulation
of
that
speech
was
permissible
under
central
hudson.
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
it's
too
broad.
really,
the
only
thing
before
the
court
is
news
and
editorial
copy.
the
only
point
i'd
make,
justice
rehnquist,
on
the
construction
point
is
that
i
think
that
where
the
government
gets
off
track
in
application
of
the
construction
cases,
catholic
bishop
and
debartolo,
is
that
instead
of
stopping
at
the
stopping
point
that
that
prudential
rule
is
designed
to
achieve
for
the
court,
namely,
avoiding
the
decision
of
constitutional
issues
if
you
don't
find
a
clear
intent
of
congress
to
cover
the
thing
that's
before
the
court
in
the
case...
what
the
government
does
is
to
say...
it
goes
a
step
further
and
says
what
the
statute
still
covers
is
commercial
speech.
the
court
simply
need
not
decide
under
catholic
bishop
or
debartolo
what's
left
under
the
statutory
section.
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
that
is
all
the
relief
we've
ever
sought
in
regard
to
the
prize
list
clause--
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
--that's
right.
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
i
believe
that's
correct.
the
court
does
not
need
to
do
that.
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
no,
i
did
not.
i
was
not
present
when
the
case
was
tried
with
judge
magnuson,
but
i
have
reviewed
the...
all
the
documents
that
were
filed
with
the
court.
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
there
really
was
not
that
kind
of
discussion.
the
government's
brief...
memorandum
argued
in
the
alternative
to
the
court
that...
that
if
the
statute
were
to
be
applied
to
news
and
editorial
copy,
that
it
would
meet
the
strict
scrutiny
tests
of
fully
protected
speech.
but
if
it
did
not
and
if
the
court
held
it
only
to
apply
to
commercial
speech,
then
it
applied
the
commercial
speech
analysis.
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
from
reading...
from
reading
the...
the
government's
memorandum
in
the
case,
i
would
say
that
the
government
has
not
changed
its
position.
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
no,
they
did
not,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
they
asked
solely
for
a
judgment
that
it
was
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
news
and
editorial
copy.
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
i
think
once
you've
gone
through
the
construction
analysis,
no
controversy
remains
in
this
case.
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
yes,
indeed,
they
did,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
exactly.
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
and
quite
frankly,
below
the
advertising
clause
was
the
one
that
loomed
most
important
in
the
minds
of
the
newspaper
because
they
were
under
that
clause--
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
--that's
right.
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
they
were
prevented
from...
from
running...
by
the
postal
service
applying
that
from
running
advertisements
of
locally
legal
lotteries
in
minnesota--
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
--yes,
it's
gone.
it's
gone.
congress
fixed
that
or
at
least
they
fixed
it
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
papers.
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
advertising
judgment
should
be
vacated.
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
that
stands.
i
mean,
it
was
prize
lists
and
nothing
but
prize
lists,
justice
white.
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
actually
18
months,
justice
scalia.
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
yes.
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
well--
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
--no,
that's
correct.
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
we
will
be
affected
by
it...
the
newspapers
in
minnesota
and
elsewhere...
until
may
of
1990.
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
the
judgment
stands.
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
that's
right.
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
the
dismissal.
the
dismissal
stands
and
that
is
no
longer
at
issue
in
the
case.
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
that's
correct.
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
that
is
the...
that's
the
net
result
of
where
we
are.
i
would
like...
not
that
the
court
needs
reminding
in
great
detail
about
catholic
bishop
and
debartolo,
but
i
think
it's
important
to
address
a
question
that
justice
scalia
put
to
the
government
about
the
legislative
history
of
this...
of
this
statute.
and
incidentally,
on
february
21,
i
contacted
the
deputy
solicitor
general,
after
we
had
gotten
deeply
into
the
briefing
process,
and
suggested
a
joint
motion
to
this
court
based
on
what
was
then
the
agreed
construction
of
this
statute
to
ask
the
court
to
dismiss
this
case,
vacate
the
judgment
below.
so,
we...
we
felt,
at
least
a
month
ago,
that...
that
this
was
the
result
that
was
certainly
acceptable
to
us.
the
statutory
construction
analysis
of
the...
of
nlrb
v.
catholic
bishop
really
fits
this
case
like
a
glove.
in
that
case,
the
court
will
recall
the
national
labor
relations
board
had
applied
the
jurisdiction
under
the
nlra
to
some
mixed
religious
and
secular
schools
in
the...
in
the
archdiocese
of
chicago.
that
was
appealed
by
the...
by
the
archbishop,
and
it
went
to
the
seventh
circuit
which
held
that
application
facially
unconstitutional.
that
was,
in
turn,
appealed
by
the
board
to
this
court.
and
this
court
determined
that
under
the...
going
back
to
mr.
justice
marshall's
opinion
in
murray
v.
the
charming
betsy
in
1804,
the
prudential
notion
that
this
court
shouldn't
decide
constitutional
questions
and
get
into
the
actions
of
congress
on...
to
judge
them
constitutionally
unless
there
really
were
a
reason
to
do
so.
if
that
could
be
avoided
by
construction,
the
court
should
do
it.
in
catholic
bishop,
the
court
announced
a
version
of
that
rule
which
i
think
is
a
little
more
precise
and
objective
than
earlier
versions.
what
it
said
was
that
a
two-step
test
should
be
applied.
number
one...
this
was
a
narrow
question...
if
the
application
of
the
statute...
too
in
this
case
it
was
the
religious
activity,
another
clause
of
the
first
amendment...
was
such
as
to
raise
this
kind
of
sensitive
constitutional
issue,
then
you
went
to
the
words.
you
went
to
congress
and
you
went
to
the
act.
you
went
to
the
legislative
history
and
you
found
out
if,
in
fact,
it
was
a
clearly
expressed
intention
of
congress
to
apply
the
broad
language
of
the...
in
this
case
the
jurisdiction
clause
of
the
act...
to
this
kind
of
sensitive
activity.
and
if
you
didn't
find
that,
absent
that,
then
it
was
to
be
construed
not
to
apply.
now,
the
same...
the
court
was
divided
in
catholic
bishop.
the
court
really
joined
last
year
in
debartolo
v.
florida
building
trades
and
applied
what
it
called
the
traditional
rule
of
catholic
bishop
in
a
similar
situation
dealing
directly
with
speech
in
a
peaceful
hand-billing
situation
in
a
florida
shopping
mall.
i
think
it's
terribly
important
that
what
those
cases
hold
applies
here
in
that
a
careful
reading,
justice
scalia,
of
the...
not
just
the...
the
anti-lottery
act
of
1890,
but
the
many
pages
of
text
of
the
house
report,
and
all
of
the
reports
in
the
history,
you
simply
find
no
expression
on
the
part
of
the
sponsors
of
the
bill
to
apply
this
to
news
and
editorial.
it
seemed
fairly
clear
that
at
least
as
far
as
newspapers
were
concerned...
and
newspapers
were
added
to
the
act,
as
the
government
has
said,
for
the
first
time
in
1890.
what
they
were
concerned
about
was
the
advertising.
they
mentioned
the
prize
lists,
but
it
appeared
to
be
their
assumption
that
that
was
something
which,
as
far
as
newspapers
went,
was
included
within
advertising.
there
was
no
expression
of
any
intent
to
cover
news
and
editorial.
and
[inaudible]
cases--
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
--i
believe
that's
correct,
justice--
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
--well,
in
any
event,
it
is...
it
is...
we
agree
with
the
government.
the
government,
as
i
said
earlier,
went
a...
went
a
little
different
direction
after
citing
debartolo
and
catholic
bishop
at
page
28
of
their
brief
to
this
court,
and
went
on
not
just
to
stop
with
what
the
act
does
not
cover,
avoiding
the
constitutional
problem
here,
but
went
on
to
say
what
the
act
does
cover.
and
i
think
a
great
deal
of
attention
has
been
given
by
the
government
to
deciding
what
is
commercial
speech,
what
would
it
apply
to
other
kinds
of
lotteries
that
newspapers
might
or
might
not
be
involved
in
or
other
parties,
professional
gamblers
might
or
might
not
be
involved
in.
but
because
the
only
issue
before
this
court
is
the
application
to
the
fully
protected
news
and
editorial
speech
about
lotteries,
we
submit
that
your...
your
prudential
construction
rules
get
us
to
a
common
stopping
place.
and
we
ask
that
the
court
vacate
the
judgment
below
based
on
that
analysis
and
lift
the
injunction
in
the
case.
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
we
don't
think
that
those
sensitive
issues
are
before
the
court
today.
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
yes,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
i'm
sorry.
that...
vacate
the
entire
judgment
as
to
the
prize
list
clause.
the
advertising
judgment
of
the
court
will
stand.
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
deakins
v.
monaghan.
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
i
puzzled
over
the--
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
--i
puzzled
over
the
kind
of
metaphysical
differences
between
reversal
and
vacation
and
dismissal
with
prejudice.
i
think
that--
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
--it
sounds...
it
sounds
awful.
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
we
would
have
no...
no
objection
assuming
the
court
analyzes
this
from
a
construction
point
of
view
and
does
not
apply
it
to
the
speech
we
brought
to
the
court,
as
a
matter
of
concern
under
the
prize
list
clause,
then
the
vacation
of
the
facial
holding
below
with
prejudice
is
of
no
concern
to
us.
but
we
would
ask,
given
the
government's
change
of
position,
given
the...
the
concession
in
the
government's
brief
at
page
9
of
their
reply
brief,
that,
in
fact,
there
is
confusion
in
the
postal
service,
we
would
ask
that
the
court
articulate
the
reason
for
this
so
there
is
some
guidance,
as
counsel
for
the
government
has
asked,
for
those
postal
service
employees
that
this
does
not
reach
into
news
and
editorial
copy.
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
yes,
if
i
understand,
justice
rehnquist.
you
could
certainly
write...
if
the
government's
position
is
that
it's
not
to
be
construed
to
be
applied
to
this
kind
of
speech,
i
would
have
certainly
no...
we
would
have
certainly
no
objection
to
that
kind
of
decision
of
the
court.
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
yes,
right.
but
i
just
want
to
make
clear
whatever...
however
the
court
writes
it...
and
i
think
there
are,
as
justice
scalia
suggests,
there
are
several
ways
around
the
barn
to
accomplish
that
result.
and
i
don't
know
what
the
exact
word
is
to
describe
what
the
court
does,
but
we
certainly
feel
that
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned...
and
it's
the
application
of
this
clause,
the
news
and
editorial
copy,
the
case
is
over
because
we
do
accept
that
construction
as...
as
required
by
your
authorities.
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
well,
we...
we
have
certainly
not
asked
that
it
be
affirmed,
and
i
suspect
it
would
not
be
proper
for
the
court
to
do
that.
mr.
p.
cameron
devore
but
that
would,
in
fact...
somewhat
probably
ironically,
it
would
have
the
same
result
in
regard
to
the
speech
at
issue
in
the
case
today.
mr.
p.
