mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
portion
of
the
kentucky
prison
litigation
was
filed
by
inmate
james
1976
and
became
known
as
the
case
of
thompson
v.
bland.
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
a
class
action,
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
at
the
kentucky
state
reformatory?
i
do
not
believe
so.
some
of
them
are
still
in
the
kentucky
corrections
system
and
in
other
corrections
systems.
i'm
not
aware
as
to
whether
or
not
any
of
the
named...
initial
named
plaintiffs
are
still
at
their
former
reformatory.
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
no,
ma'am.
it
was
settled
as
a
class
action,
and
the
consent
decree
was
settled
in
a
manner
to
bind
the
kentucky
corrections
cabinet
in
the
future.
a
far-reaching
consent
decree
settling
that
litigation
as
continued--
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
--it
arises,
i
believe,
out
of
the
consent
decree
and
the
regulations
that
were
in
place
both
prior
and
after
the
consent
decree.
i
think
that
the
opinion
of
the
sixth
circuit
is
trifle
bit
unclear
in
that
at
the
close
of
the
opinion
they
say
we
do
not
reach
the
issue
of
whether
a
consent
decree
alone
can
give
rise
to
a
due
process
case.
i
think
the
consent
decree
supplies
a
portion
of
the
mandatory
language
required
by
hewitt
v.
helms.
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
well,
the
mootness
would
be...
the
consent
because
it
is
a
portion
of
the
mandatory
language
that
the
sixth
circuit
found--
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
--it
might
possibly
be
moot,
your
honor,
but
it
isn't.
it
is
a
class
action.
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
the--
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
--the
regulation
applies
to
all
inmates
incarcerated
at
that
institution.
it
was
a
class
action.
it
was
a
consent
decree.
it
might
not
apply
be...
if
that
single
plaintiff
was
out
of
prison,
although
it
is
an
issue,
i
think,
clearly
capable
of
evading
review
because
of
the
problem
of,
an
inmate
being
out
of
prison--
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
--it
is
a
class
action.
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
in
this
case
it
is
a
class
action.
there
is
class-based
relief
on
the
consent
decree.
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
no,
sir,
the
consent
decree
when
it
was
settled
was
settled
to
bind
the
future.
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
the
class
action...
it
was
a
certified
class
action
and
settled
after
the
class
action
was
certified
for...
and
by
its
terms,
the
consent
decree
by
its
terms,
was
to
bind
the
defendants
in
the
future.
i
don't
think
the
defendants
would
take
the
position
that
this
consent
decree
does
not
bind
them.
it
bound
them
through--
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
--your
honor,
it's
not
moot
because
there
are
members
of
the
class
of
inmates
incarcerated
at
the
reformatory
who
were
given
the
protection
of
the
consent
decree
and
as
a
portion
of
the
certified
class,
the
class
being
all
people
incarcerated
now
or
incarcerated
in
the
future
at
the
kentucky
state
reformatory.
that's
not
in
this
particular
record,
but
that
was
the
class
that
judge
johnstone
certified
the
district
court
level.
the
consent
decree
was
intended
to
protect
the
inmates
incarcerated
and
all
those
incarcerated
in
the
future.
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
all
inmates
incarcerated
in
the
kentucky
state
reformatory.
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
these
things
are--
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
--just
johnstone
once
asked
me
how
long--
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
--i
was
going
to
be
one
this
case.
i
said
probably
as
long
as
i
practice
law
in
the
western
district.
[laughter]
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
it's
not
in
the
record,
but
there
has
been
a
substantial
compliance
trial,
and
the
judge
has
indicated
that
the
defendants
are
in
substantial
compliance
with
the
consent
decree
and
has
moved
the
case
from
his
active
to
his
inactive
status
at
this
point
on
his
inactive
docket.
he
has
indicated
that
there's
a
contractual
right
of
all
the
inmates,
as
i
read
it,
in
perpetuity,
to
enforce
this
consent
decree
in
the
future,
should
he
dismiss
the
case.
the
case
is
not
yet
dismissed.
mootness
might
be
a
possibility
after
he
dismisses
the
case.
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
probably
a
good
chance,
your
honor.
i
sort
of
lost
track.
i've
lost
track
of
some
of
the
inmates.
one
of
them
may
be
back
in
the
reformatory
at
this
time.
there
was
an
inmate
named
wilgus
hattox
and
you
don't
know
where
wilgus
is
on
any
given
day,
except
he's
probably
somewhere
in
the
kentucky
corrections
system.
[laughter]
this
consent...
one
of
the
important
parts
of
this
case
is
that
this
consent
decree
was
the
result
of
four
years
of
vigorous
litigation
by
highly
skilled
counsel,
including
myself,
mrs.
jones,
and
representatives
of
the
united
states
justice
department
as
litigating
amicus
curiae.
when
the
case
was
settled,
no
fewer
than
13
lawyers
signed
the
consent
decree.
this
gives
ample
evidence
of
when
a
state
official,
after
that
kind
of
intensive
litigation,
signs
a
consent
decree,
that
it
is
the
volitional
act
of
those
state
officials.
prior
to
the
kentucky
correctional
policies
and
procedures
being
promulgated,
there
was
a
prior
procedure
called
the
internal
management
directives.
the
internal
management
directives
concerning
visitation
are
quite
similar
to
what
was
later
issued
post-consent
decree.
a
case
by
the
name
of
bills
v.
henderson,
a
sixth
circuit
case,
indicated
in
1980
that
a
consent
that
a
liberty
interest
could
be
created
in
the
sixth
circuit
"in
the
forfeiture
or
benefit
of
favorable
living
conditions."
this
case
was
decided
prior
to
the
reissue
of...
of
the
procedures
by
the
state
of
kentucky.
there
was
a
second
set
of
procedures
issued
at
the
institution
level
at
a
later
date.
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
based
on--
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
--the
sixth
circuit
found
the
mandatory
language
necessary
under
hewitt
v.
helms
to
exist
partially
in
the
consent
decree
and
partially
in
the
regulations
that
were
issued--
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
and
then
the
sixth
circuit
said,
standing
alone,
we're
not
going
to
reach
that
issue.
judge
johnstone
indicated
in
his
opinion
at
the
district
court
that
the
"open
visitation
language
in
the
consent
decree
in
and
of
itself
created
the
liberty
interest."
the
sixth
circuit
then
came
along
and
said
it's
the
consent
decree,
plus
the
regulations.
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
sure.
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
no,
and
that
isn't...
the
sixth
circuit,
again,
judge
johnstone
found
that
the
defendants
were
in
compliance
wit
the
consent
decree.
what
judge
johnstone
and
the
sixth
circuit
said
was
the,
"open
visitation
language
and
the
sixth
circuit,
later
the
regulations
issued,
gave
the
inmates
an
entitlement
to
continue
open
visitation."
and
at
that
point,
it
had
its
basis
in
the
consent
decree,
but
the
right
for
the
hearing
arises
from
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
the
state
has
taken
the
volitional
act.
the
state
has
extended
the
right,
the
state
has
created
this
right,
and
then,
therefore,
once
they
create
the
right
and
fetter
their
own
discretion,
the
fourteenth
amendment
comes
into
play.
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
they
created
this
right
three
ways:
by
issuing...
by
signing
the
consent
decree
and
by
putting
the
open
visitational
language
in
the
consent
decree,
and
by
issuing
the
correctional
policies
and
procedures
which
are
statewide,
and
the
kentucky
state
reformatory
policies
and
procedures,
which
are
institutionwide.
and
in...
through
each...
throughout
each
of
these
there
is
the
mandatory
language
required
by
hewitt,
with
the
substantive
predicates
to
follow.
and
in
two
portions
of
the
regulations
a
nonexhaustive
listing
of
criteria
for
the
officer
to
follow.
counsel
for
the
defendants
has
indicated
these
are
for
staff
goals
alone.
they're
also
to
assist
the
inmate
in
learning
what
conduct
is
sufficient
within
an
institution
that's
going
to
get
you
your
visitation
denied.
and
one
of
the
reasons
that
a
prison's
supposed
to
promulgate
regulations,
according
to
the
american
correctional
association,
is
so
that
the
inmate
knows
what's
to
be
expected
of
him.
it's
not
only
for
staff
benefit
but,
by
its
own
very
nature,
is
to
tell
the
inmate
what
limits
are
to
be
expected.
i
think
one
of
the
keys
is
the
fact
that
through
the
regulations,
there
is
repeated
use
of
mandatory
language.
there
is
the
mandatory
language
of
the
consent
decree.
there's
also
the
substantive
predicates
required
in
the
hewitt
v.
helms.
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
regulations
that
are
attached
to
the
petitioners'
brief,
the
regulations
that
are
going
to
create
the
monster,
that
is
going
to
create
the
day-to-day
problem
for
the
corrections
cabinet
in
their
opinion
of
dealing
with
the
sixth
circuit's
opinion
is
that
the
mandatory
language
followed
by
substantive
predicate
is
simply
not
there
with
the
possible
exception
of
the
library
card.
i
think
this
court
could
draw
a
line
about
library
cards.
i
believe
that
failure
to
return
a
library
book
and
therefore
having
your
library
privileges
denied
could
be
dealt
with
by
a
part
of
the
hewitt
opinion.
one
of
the
thing
the
hewitt
opinion
says
in
its
later
stages
is
that
the
hearing
should
create
some
benefit
to
the
institution
and
some
benefit
in
dealing
with
the
problem
at
hand.
for
example,
would
a
hearing
over
whether
or
not
your
library
privileges
be
returned
be
of
any
benefit
to
the
institution
or
to
the
inmate?
i
think
the
court
could
draw
that
line.
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
i
don't
think
you
should,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
of
the
nature
that
this
court...
i
think
this
court
can
draw
a
line.
this
court
obviously
has
to
draw
some
line.
if
some
state
was
misfortunate
enough
to
have
drafted
a
shall/unless
policy
about
how
many
pieces
of
silverware
an
inmate
got
on
his
table
at
night,
i
don't
think
that
would
give
rise
to
a
due
process
hearing
about
why
he's
missing
a
knife
tonight
unless...
i
think
the
court
can
draw
a--
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
--please?
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
i
think
you
can.
as
i
said,
if...
if
you
look
to
whether
or
not
the
hearing
in
and
of
itself
would
create
any
benefit
for
the
inmate
or
benefit
in
determining
why
he
doesn't
have
his
spoon
today.
no
hearing
is
going...
is
going
to
create
that
sort
of
benefit,
nor
is
any
hearing
going
to
create
any
real
benefit
for
the
inmate.
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
that
is
one
of
the--
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
--it
is
a
predicate
right.
i'm
attempting
to
address
the
issue
of
if
somebody
does
create
a
predicate
right
in
an
absolutely
minor
matter...
for
example,
the
case
i
cited
in
my
brief
of
the
united
states
v.
state
of
michigan,
which
deals
with
whether
or
not
you
have
the
right
to
food
versus
a
food
loaf.
there
is
no
question
in
that
case
that
the
food
loaf
was
adequately
nutrition...
was
adequately
nutritious
for
the
inmate
in
that
situation.
it
didn't
taste
as
goods,
basically,
was
a
problem.
the
court,
in
that
case,
found
that
you
had
an
entitlement
to
not
having
food
loaf
to
having
regular
food,
and
then
basically
at
that
point
dismissed
whether
or
not
a
hearing
had
to
be
held.
it's
unclear
exactly
what
standard
the
court
applied
in
that
case.
that
is
only
a
minor
matter.
i
think
this
court
could
draw
it
and
say
a
minor
matter
or
a
situation
where
a
hearing
would
have
no
benefit
either
to
the
cabinet
or
to
the
inmate.
in
the
case
at
bars,
as
i
understand
what
the
sixth
circuit
did
on
remand,
what
they
put
in
their
remand,
was
that
the
hearing
does
not
have
to
be
on
the
spot.
we
are
not
telling
the
correctional
officer
at
the
institution
who
is
standing
at
a
visitation
denial
for
possibly
a
reason
of
violence
or
contraband
that
they
have
to
stop
at
that
moment
and
have
a
hearing.
the
sixth
circuit,
i
believe,
would
require
and
the
district
court
a
hearing
within
a
reasonable
time.
i
believe
that
a
hearing
within
a
reasonable
time
in
which
an
inmate
has
some
ability
to
rebut,
in
essence,
the
corrections
cabinet's
evidence.
justice
stevens
asked
what
would
be
sufficient
for
the
sixth
circuit,
whether
or
not
just
a
note
was
sufficient.
the
sixth
circuit
said...
went
one
little
step
further,
which
is
an
opportunity
to
be
heard,
did
not
interpret
it
as
requiring
a
hearing
as
in
court
calls
kentucky
state
reformatory,
or
face
to
face
but,
essentially,
paper.
the
state
of
kentucky
drops
the
inmate
a
note
saying
your
mother
brought
contraband
to
the
prison
last
week.
we're
going
to
suspend
her
visitation.
the
inmate
write
it
back
and
says,
i'm
sorry,
that
was
inmate
jones'
mother
and
not
mine.
if
you'll
check
your
records,
you've
made
a
mistake.
that's
all
the
sixth
circuit
requires.
i
cannot
see
how
that--
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
--that
would
satisfy
me.
that's
all
the
sixth
circuit
requires.
it's
all
that
judge
johnstone
requires.
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
i
think--
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
--part
of
the
answer
to
that
question
is
superintendent
v.
wolpole
which
has
said
that
any
evidence
is
sufficient
for
court
call.
i
suspect
xx
i
came
back
to
this
court
questioning
whether
there
was
sufficient
evidence
in
a
hewitt
v.
helms
hearing,
that
would
get
substantially
similar
treatment
to
of
superintendent
v.
wolpole,
that
there
would
be
in
any
evidence
a
sufficient
standard
to
sustain
the
warden.
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
i
think
he
has
some
good
faith
duty
to
do
something
with--
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
--some
legal
duty
to
do
something
with
the
note
rather
than
just
put
it
in
his
round
file
next
to
his
desk?
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
it's
not
nothing.
and
neither
is
visitation.
one
of
the
things
that's
important
to
remember
is
the
potential
that
could
affect
the
inmate.
if
an
inmate's
visits
are
suspended
for,
say,
six
months
with
his
mother,
this
potentially
is
as
many
as
72
visits.
the
regulations
which
the
state
has
promulgated
say
that
in
case
of
contraband,
it
could
be
indefinitely.
now,
if
a
man's
serving
30
years
and
his
wife
brings
contraband
to
the
institution
and
the
warden
says
indefinitely,
that's
where
we're
at.
that
could
be
for
the
rest
of
that
inmate's
time.
and
that
is
an
extremely
serious
matter,
indeed.
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
not
on
a
constitutional
basis.
they...
under
the
kentucky
consent
decree,
visitation
has
to
be
at
the
same
level
as
when
the
consent
decree
was
entered.
if
tomorrow
they
cut
off
all
vision
at
the
consent
decree
tomorrow
afternoon,
i'll
be
back
in
front
of
judge
johnston
saying,
wait
a
minute,
judge
johnston,
they're
in
contempt
of
the
consent
decree.
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
because
it
concretized
existing
procedure
at
the
reformatory.
it
says
that
visitation
shall
be
as
at
least
kept
at
the
level
as
of
entry
of
the
consent
decree.
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
your
honor,
i
don't
think
any
provision
of
the
constitution
authorized
that.
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
your
honor,
because
that's
what
the
parties
settled
on.
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
i'm
not
going
to
sign
a
consent
decree
in
a
prison
situation
that
allows
for
no
visitation
whatsoever.
my
clients
would
sue
me
and
have
me
fired
within
seconds
of
signing,
and
i
don't
think
the
court
would
approve
a
consent
decree
under
those
circumstances.
this
was
a
give
and
take
procedure.
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
it
addressed
unconstitutional
conditions
at
the
kentucky
state
reformatory.
but,
because
of
the
nature
of
the
consent
decree
that
was
settled
eventually,
it
encompassed...
any
consent
decree
does
in
an
institutional
litigation...
the
whole
aspect
of
life
at
the
reformatory.
when
we
settled
with
the
state
of
kentucky,
we
gave
them
this
and
they
gave
us
other
things.
that's
part
of
settling
lawsuits
and
negotiating
consent
decrees.
and
sometimes
you
will
get
more
than
you're
entitled
to
on
a
constitutional
basis
because
you've
given
up
something
else
somewhere
else.
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
being
harassed
by
a
guard,
intentionally
harassed?
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
i
think
he
would
have
at
least
an
arguable
protection
case,
i
think,
if
they
singled
out
this
inmate
alone.
i
don't
think
that
would
meet
a
rational
basis
test
under
equal
protection.
i'm
not
familiar...
i'm
not
quite
sure
that's
the
test
in
a
prison
situation,
but
clearly
if
that
is
a
test
rational
basis,
there's
no
rational
basis
to
deny
joe
jones
his
visitation.
now,
if
joe
jones
is
on
death
row
or
if
joe
jones
has
done
this
or
that
and
there
is
some
rational
basis,
obviously
if
they
deny
one
class
of
inmates
visitation
on
race...
on
race
grounds,
that
would
present
a
suspect
category
problem.
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
i
think
he
might
possibly
be
able
to
recover
damages
if
there
was
a
total
failure
of
the
process.
if
it
got
down
to
a
question
of
whether
or
not
it
was
an...
it
was
a...
the
decision
was
correct,
i
think
this
court
would
clearly
apply
a
superintendent
v.
wolpole-type
standard
to
that
situation.
i
think
a
total
failure
of
the
process,
it
might
go
as
to
whether
or
not
it
would
be
a
qualified
immunity
question
at
that
point.
i
think
a
total
failure
of
the
process
would
clearly
be
actionable.
one
of
the
problems,
i
believe,
with
the
analysis
of
the
state
is
that
it
takes...
in,
in...
and
in
a
due
process
analysis,
first,
i
think,
in
an
analysis
such
as
this,
you
look
to
the
constitution
to
see
whether
or
not
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
visitation.
it
is
clear
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
visitation.
then
you
look
to
the
actions
of
the
state
officials
to
see
whether
or
not
the
state
officials
have
created
any
sort
of
right.
what
the
state
is
asking
us
to
do
at
that
point
is
to
come
back,
if
you
will,
on
the
back
end
of
substantive...
of
derivative
due
process
and
impose
on
the
back
side,
in
essence,
a
substantive
due
process
theory
that
it
would
be
only
in
matters
of
some
sort
of
critical
importance.
i
think
that
is
beyond
the
scope
of
what
derivative
due
process
is
all
about.
i
believe
you
have
to
look
to
what
did
the
state
officials
intend.
and
i
think
clearly
in
this
case
there
is
ample
evidence,
both
because
of
the
consent
decree
and
of
the
regulations
that
were
issued,
that
they
knew
exactly
what
they
were
doing.
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
clearly...
clearly,
initially...
the
initial
litigation
is
based
on
constitutional
premises,
but
i
think
nothing
prohibits
the
state
of
kentucky
volitionally
granting
additional
rights,
particularly
in
a
consent
decree
context.
consent
decrees
often
will...
will
literally
give
the
state
a
road
map
on
how
to
run
its
prison
for
the
next
20
years.
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
the
give
and
take
for
that
is
that
any
party
when
negotiating
a
consent
decree
gives
up
certain
things
because
they
want
a
consent
decree.
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
yes,
sir.
i
think
under
the...
i
believe
that
even
though
you
may
step
beyond
what
is
constitutional,
the
court
can
still
have
authority
over
that
consent
decree,
even
for
visitation.
i
don't
think
there's
any
requirement
that
this
court,
that
i'm
aware
of,
that
only
constitutional
issues
be
brought
up
in
a
consent
decree.
they
are...
they're
wide
ranging.
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
in
a
litigated
decree
if
the
judge
was
to
step
beyond
and
accept
independent
state
action,
there
would
be
a
problem
that
would
be
subject
to
reversal
by
the
court.
the
parties
have
agreed
that,
yes,
we're
going
to
do
this
in
return
for
this.
for
example,
one
of
the
things
that
they
agreed
to
do
was
to
have
the
prison
population
of
the
kentucky
state
reformatory
at
a
certain
level
within
so
many
years.
possibly
if
i
had
gone
to
trial
and
settled
the
case,
judge
johnstone
might
have
ordered
a
quicker
timetable
to
bring
the...
the
population
down
to
a
level
where
it
would
be
constitutional.
of
course,
population
in
and
of
itself
is
not
a
constitutional
question,
it's
a
totality,
population
being
only
one
of
the
factors.
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
that's
correct.
that's--
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
--for
a
violation
of
the
consent
decree,
and
that
would
be
the
traditional
contempt
powers
of
the
judicial
court.
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
all
right,
at
the
initial
district
court,
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
this
was
done
separately,
not
a
part
of
substantial
compliance.
i
think
about
a
year
prior,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
this
was
a
more
or
less
routine
motion
during
my
monitoring
of--
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
--no,
sir.
it
was
as
a
portion
of
the
court's
monitoring
of
the
consent
decree.
the
court
said--
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
--the
consent
decree--
mr.
joseph
s.
elder,
ii
--he
indicated
that
the
procedures
there
were
constitutional.
your
honor's
question
is
whether
or
not
if
an
inmate
were
to
tomorrow
be
denied
prison...
be
denied
his
"open
visitation",
could
i
then
not
go
back
and
request
that
the
judge
put
the
case
back
on
a...
on
active
status
and
request
that
the
judge
hold
the
state
in
contempt
because
this
inmate
did
not
have
a...
his
visitational,
open
visitation
was
being
denied.
that
is
correct.
however,
i
think
that
the
sixth
circuit
in
saying
that
we're
not
going
to
make
this
a
consent
decree
matter,
that
a
consent
decree
is
only
a
portion
of
it.
a
consent
decree,
in
and
of
itself,
was
only
a
portion
of
the
mandatory
language
required
to
reach
the...
to
give
an
entitlement
to
due
process.
i
believe
that
probably,
standing
alone,
the
regulations
would
have
been
sufficient
absent
a
consent
decree.
but,
because
of
the
nature
of
the
beast,
so
to
speak,
that
mandatory
language
is
there.
it
buttresses
the
consent
decree,
and
i
believe
because
of,
in
essence,
the
double
mandatory
language
gives
this
court
a
stronger
basis
to
say
that
in
this
case
there
was
a
liberty
interest
created
by
the
mandatory
language
of
the
consent
decree,
by
the
correctional
policies
and
procedures
and
the
language
therein.
thank
you.
i
believe
this
court
should
affirm
the
sixth
circuit.
