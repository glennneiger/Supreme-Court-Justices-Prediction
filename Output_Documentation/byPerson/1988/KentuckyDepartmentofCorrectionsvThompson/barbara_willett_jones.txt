ms.
barbara
willett
jones
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
was
brought
by
the
commonwealth
because
the
sixth
circuit
ruled
that
state
procedures
written
for
staff
use
in
the
operation
of
visitation
program
created
a
constitutionally-protected
right.
in
1980
the
commonwealth
signed
a
consent
decree.
in
that
decree
the
commonwealth
agreed
to
continue
to
operate
certain
programs,
at
least
at
their
current
level,
and
the
continuation
of
open
visitation
was
one
of
those
programs.
in
1986,
the
respondents
filed
a
request
with
the
district
court,
through
appropriate
motions,
asking
the
court
to
direct
the
commonwealth
to
implement
due
process
procedures
before
it
restricted
visitation
or
visitors
from
the
institution.
respondents
argued
that
the
commonwealth's
failure
to
implement
these
due
process
procedures
was
in
violation
of
the
consent
decree
and
the
due
process
clause.
the
district
court
concluded
that
no
violations
of
the
consent
decree
had
occurred,
but
ruled
that
the
language
of
the
consent
decree
itself,
which
addressed
the
visitation
programs,
were
so
mandatory
in
character
that
it
gave
rise
to
a
liberty
interest
requiring
the
implementation
of
due
process
procedures.
and
the
court
directed
that
the
commonwealth
implement
those
kinds
of
procedures
recommended
by
this
court
in
hewitt
v.
helms
before
visitation
was
suspended
or
revoked,
and
that
is
a
notice
opportunity
to
be...
opportunity
to
respond.
on
appeal,
the
sixth
circuit
concluded
that
the
procedures
themselves
were
mandatory
in
character,
substantively
limited
the
discretion
of
the
state
official
by
enumerating
particularized
standards
or
criteria,
and
created
to
protect
the
liberty
interest,
thus
requiring
the
implementation
of
due
process
procedures.
the
sixth
circuit
then
remanded
the
case
back
to
the
district
court
for
directions
in
accordance
with
its
mandate.
when
determining
whether
state
procedures
create
a...
protect
the
liberty
interest,
the
commonwealth
is
urging
that
this
court
draw
a
line
between
those
procedures
which
affect
the
daily
management
of
a
prison
from
those
procedures
which
affect
length
of
confinement,
release
from
confinement,
or
those
procedures
which
dramatically
alter
the
very
nature
of
confinement.
when
state
procedures
are
drafted
which
affect--
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
--the
kinds--
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
--the
kinds
of
things
that
we
see
in
terms
of
nature
of
confinement
are
the
kinds
of...
i
could
reference
the
court
to
the
cases
where
we
think
fall
within
that
definition.
and
that
would
be
this
court's
decisions
in
vitek
v.
jones,
which
address
mental
involuntary
commitment
to
a
mental
facility;
hewitt
v.
helms,
where
there
was
incarceration--
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
--yes,
your
honor.
we're
saying
that
that
dramatically
alters
the
nature
of
confinement,
and
when
that's
written
in
conjunction
with
due
process
procedure...
our
procedures
are
very
limiting
in
the
discretion
of
the
officials,
that
that
would
meet
that
standards.
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
we
would
view
that
as
a
condition
of
confinement,
and
this
court
has
ruled
that
in
olim
and
in
other
cases,
but
i
think
olim
addressed
the
question,
although
that
was
not
the
ruling
and
the
holding
of
the
case...
this
court
recognized
in
olim
that
a
transfer
from
hawaii
to
california,
which
would
subject
an
individual
to
not
having
access
to
family
or
friends,
did
not
implicate
any
serious
interest
and
denial
of
visits
and
visitors
is
a
very
normal
type
of
limit
of
confinement
that
is
expected
in
penal
settings.
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
i
think
that's
clearly
protected
under
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause
or
unreasonable
and
arbitrary
harassment
that
state
officials
cannot
act
in
that
manner
towards--
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
--i
think
some
conduct
of
state
officials,
if
they've
singled
out
an
inmate,
not
necessarily
for
visiting,
but
any...
whatever
it
is,
visiting,
denying
him
access
to
a
library...
if
it
is
so
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
that
it
could
reach
the
level
of
an
eighth
amendment
claim--
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
--i
don't
see
that.
i
don't
think
that's
what
i'm
suggesting.
i'm
suggesting
that
i
think
that
this
court
has
ruled...
and
i
think
it
was
in
whitley
v.
albers...
that
there
are...
that
an
inmate
is
not
totally
unprotected
from...
no,
i'm
sorry,
i
believe
it's
in
the
daniels
v.
williams
and
davidson
v.
cannon
where
this
court
said
inmates
are
not
totally
unprotected
from
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
conduct
by
state
officials
and
cannot
be...
harassed.
and
i
believe
that
is
within
the
eighth
amendment,
and
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
that
in
those
decisions.
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
that's
correct.
and
our
point
here
is
you
have
state-created
rights.
and
this
court
has
found
in
most
of
its
decisions
that
address
a
penal
setting,
and
in
particular
greenholtz,
that
every
executive
decision
made
by
an
executive
branch
member
is
not
guaranteed
to
be
error-free.
and
we
are
suggesting
that
when
you
find
state...
if
you
define
procedures
that
just
address
daily
policy
programs
between
those
procedures
which
affect
substantive
areas
of
incarceration,
then
you're
allowing
the
state
to
draft
procedures
that
are
very
directory
in
nature
to
run
their
programs,
but
you're
not
subjecting
them
to
federal
liability
at
every
turn
when
they're
trying
to
run
a
program
or
a
facility
to
protect
the
institution
and
the
community.
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
the
way
i
understand
the
decisions
in
the
equal
protection
clause
is
the
individual
is
going
to
have
to
be
a
member
of
the
suspect
class
first.
and
i
don't
think
an
inmate
is
a
member
of
a
suspect
class.
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
i
may
be
misunderstanding
the
equal
protection
clause.
i'm
thinking
in
terms...
well,
i
think
the...
as
i
recollect
the
cases,
the
court
has
only
held
that
equal
protection
applies
in
a
prison
setting
when
you're
dealing
with
a
suspect
class,
that
you
couldn't
separate
inmates
on
the
basis
of
race
alone.
and,
although
this
court
has
not
addressed
sex
discrimination
cases,
those
are
the
only
cases
that
i'm
familiar
with
as
they
address
in
a
penal
setting.
maybe
i'm
too
broadly
interpreting
the
equal
protection
clause,
but
that's
the
way
i
understand
it.
now,
i
think
the
other
thing
that
is
important,
your
honor,
is
that
the
inmate
is
not
without
administrative
or
state
law
remedies
in
a
situation
where
state
officials
don't
conform
themselves
with
their
own
state
policies
and
procedures.
in
the
commonwealth,
and
i
think
it's
very
typical
in
other
states,
there
are
mandamus
actions
that
individuals
can
bring
if
the
duties
that
are
set
out
in
the
state
regulation
or
state
law
are
so
ministerial
in
nature
that
it...
that
a
state
official
must
be
required
to
conform
himself.
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
i
don't
think
these
procedures
are
so
ministerial
in
nature--
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
--absolutely.
i
don't
think
we
have
to
even
have
visitation.
i
think
the
responsible--
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
we're
taking
that
broad
a
position.
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
well,
that's
correct,
we
are
saying--
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
--that
is
what
the
position
is--
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
--in
its
broadest
term.
that's
correct
practically
speaking
i,
your
honor--
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
--that's
correct.
but
what
we're
also
suggesting
to
this
court
is
this
principle
of
law
that
was
applied
by
the
sixth
circuit
to
this
fact
situation,
carried
to
its
logical
conclusion,
will
require
every
procedure
that
addresses
the
daily
operation
of
a
prison
to
create
federally
protected
rights,
so
that
the
state
is
going
to
have
to
implement
some
kind
of
due
process
almost
in
every
situation.
and
the
examples
that
we
have
given
the
court
are
those
library
procedures
that
are
even
more
mandatory
if
you're
going
to
interpret
our
procedures
as
mandatory.
the
library
procedures
say
that
we
will
not
deny
an
inmate
access
to
the
library
unless
he
doesn't
return
the
books.
that
has
a
shall/unless
combination
that
has
pretty
much
been
looked
upon
by
the
courts
below
as
the
mandatory-type
language
that
creates
these
rights.
and
we're
saying
that
if
we
don't...
if
the
court
doesn't
draw
a
line
and
make
a
distinction
between
procedures
that
are
daily
management-type
procedures
versus
procedures
which
affect
certain
areas
of
incarceration,
then
we've
got
a
very
serious
problem,
and
the
state
only
has
two
choices:
they
can
accept
that
ruling
and
continue
to
operate
with
very
detailed
mandatory
directory
procedures,
or
they
can
choose
to
write
no
procedures
at
all,
which
is
not
the
choice
of
state
officials.
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
certainly
the
state
can
reword
the
procedures.
what
happens
when
you
reword
the
procedure
to
allow
total
discretion,
you
have
deluded
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
procedures.
the
purpose
of
the
procedure
is
to
direct
staff
so
that
they
can
operate
the
program.
it
allows
for
control
and
discipline
to
maintain
security
in
the
institution.
if
you
allow
total...
if
you
diluted
the
procedure
to
such
an
extent
that
you've
allowed
total
discretion,
then
i
don't
think
you've
served
the
purpose
of...
of
the
prison--
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
--that's
correct.
in
this
instance,
it
wouldn't
serve
the
purpose
of
the
consent
decree.
but
you've
also
allowed
the
state
officials
to
carve
out
the
contours
of
a
federally
protected
right,
just
by
semantical
or
mechanical
word
change.
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
they
could
be,
yes.
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
well,
if
i'm
using
it
in
an
improper
term,
i
apologize.
but
what
we're
saying
is
by
the
way
they're
written,
they
are
interpreted
as
being
a
liberty
interest
protected
by
the
due
process
clause,
and
maybe
that's
a
shorthand
term.
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
we
would
like
to
have
a
line
drawn
and
distinctions
made
between
certain
procedures
so
that's...
i'm
sorry...
so
that
the
state
could
feel
free
to
write
very
directory-specific
procedures
that
address
daily
management
problems
and
if
they
affect
certain
areas
and
they
want
it
to
be
very
nondiscretionary
in
nature,
they
are
accepting
liability
for
a
failure
to
conform
in
conjunction
with
that.
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
that
would...
those
would
be
included.
those
procedures
that--
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
--good
time,
those
type
of
procedures
like
wolff
v.
mcdonnell.
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
right.
and
then
the
other
areas
that
we
would
suggest...
one
way
that
i
think
i
could
suggest
to
you
that
may
be
visually
easier
to
understand
is,
we
would...
it's
like
a
prison
door-type
situation,
and
the
parole...
very
easily
to
see
that
the
parole
cases
and
the
release
from
confinement
or
the
good
time
credits,
they
go
out
the
prison
door.
and
the
administrative
segregation,
the
inmate
goes
from
a
more...
a
general
population-type
situation
through
the
prison
door
to
a
more
restricted-type
setting.
in
a
mental
health-type
situation
in
vitek,
they
are
going
from
the
institution
to
another
institution
involuntary.
in
another
example
that
hasn't
been
addressed
by--
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
--your
honor--
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
--that's
a
different
kind
of
prison
door,
and
basically
this
is
more
addressed
to
the
visitor
than
it
is
to
the
inmate,
although
the
inmate
is
affected.
he
is
not
restricted
totally
from
visitation.
he
is
restricted
from
one
visitor
or
several
visitors
at
a
time.
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
in
some
inmates'
minds.
in
some
inmates'
minds,
visitation
is
not
important
at
all.
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
i'll
have
to
admit
that
there
are
more
important
visitors
than
others,
your
honor.
but,
similarly,
in
that
same
vein,
there
are
a
percentage
of
inmates
who
never
have
visitors,
whose
canteen
privileges
are
access
to
the
general
library
or
the
t.v.
or
inmate
organizations
are
equally
as
important
as
visitors
are
to
inmates.
so,
what
we're
asking--
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
--administrative
segregation
doesn't
totally
restrict
an
individual
from
visiting.
they...
administrative
segregation
just
maybe
limits
the
conditions
under
which
they
visit.
they
might
go
from
contact
and
non-contact.
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
yeah...
if...
if
the
state
procedures
are
very
mandatory
in
style
and
very...
like
the
hewitt
decision...
if
there
is
a
combination
of
facts
that
there
is
an
area
that's
affected
that
is
not
a
daily
management
procedure
and
the
state
has
drafted
procedures
that
are
very
mandatory
in
nature
and
limit
the
circumstances--
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
--well,
the
best
example
i
can
give
to
fit
the
cases
that
we
are
suggesting...
we
think
it's
a
very
narrow
line,
and
it
is
a
subject
line,
and
the
best
example
to
articulate
or
demonstrate
the
kind
of
cases
we're
talking
about
that
would
give
rise
to
this
analysis
for
liberty
interests
would
be
the
prison
door-type
analysis.
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
no,
your
honor.
the
visitor
doesn't
have
any
interest
and
has
no
right
to
visit
the
facility,
and
this
court's
ruled
on
that
in
jones
v.
north
carolina.
that,
as
the
court
knows,
was
the
press
wanting
access
to
the
institution,
and
this
court
has
clearly
ruled
that.
and
i
believe
this
court
reaffirmed
the
position
on
visitors
with
respect
to
the
olim
decision,
although,
again,
that
was
not
the
holding.
more
recently,
block
v.
rutherford,
although
it
was
not...
it
was
not
denial
of
total
visitation,
it
was
a
visitation
case
that
dealt
with
a
non-contact
versus
contact
visitation.
and
i
think
this
court
has
made
it
very
clear
that
visitation
and
restriction
of
visitation
is
very
clearly
within
the
normal
range
of
limits.
that
aspect
is
expected
in
a
penal
facility.
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
that's
correct.
we
would
like--
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
--well
we're
trying...
i
think
it
arises--
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
--i
think
it
arises
from
this
court's
decisions
where
this
court
has
continually
in
the
prison
cases
in
the
penal
area
have
recognized
there's
a
need
to
give
deference
to
the
prison
administrator,
not
be
continually
involved
in
the
daily
operations
of
a
prison
setting,
and
i
think
some
of
the
language
in
the
hewitt
decision
has...
has
been
concerned
that
this
analysis
could
create
a
problem
for
prison
administrators
by
maybe
not
creating
exception
for
procedures
that
are
just
daily
management
procedures
that
affect
programs
that
are
just
the
daily
restricted-type
programs
that
involve
a
way
to
operate
a
prison.
and
if
i
state
official
cannot
write
procedures
running
the
program
that
are
very
directory
in
nature
and
mandatory
in
style
and
premise
participation
in
that
program
or
the
denial
of
participation
in
that
program
on
whether
that
individual
or
whether
that
visitor
is
going
to
constitute
a
threat
to
the
security
of
the
institution,
which
is
the
primary
purpose
of
the
institution,
and
that's
the
primary
purpose
of
the
policies
and
procedures
is
to
maintain
the
security
of
the
institution,
then
the
state
really
can't
write
any
kind
of
procedures
that
direct
any
of
its
staff
in
order
to
maintain
control
or
discipline
over
its
facility.
and
we
don't
think
that
the
proposition
that
we're
offering
this
court
is...
is
not
inconsistent
with
this
court's
opinions.
if,
if
you
review
the
court's
parole
cases,
there
the
court
found
no
inherent
right
to
parole,
but
the
court
found
that
the
state
statutes
which
were
drafted
which
affected
parole
were
very
limited
in
nature,
very...
they
will
not
be
denied
parole
or
they
will
not
be
revoked...
their
parole
would
not
be
revoked
unless
certain
conditions
existed.
you
had
a
two-pronged
analysis.
you
had
the
nature
of
the
interest
at
stake
affected
release
from
confinement,
and
you
had
mandatory
procedures
that
were
very,
very
specific
and
conditioned
on
certain
factors.
similarly,
in
the
wolff
v.
mcdonnell
case,
the
court
clearly
recognized
that
there
was
no
right
to
the
establishment
of
good
time
credits,
but
once
the
state
created
that
right
to
good
time
credits,
the
denial
of
good
time
credits
or
the
forfeiture
of
good
time
credits
again
was
conditioned
on
a
varied
set
of
circumstances,
a
very
specific
set
of
circumstances,
major
misconduct,
and
they
would
not
be
forfeited
but
for
those
set
of
circumstances.
so,
again,
you
had
a
very
serious
nature
of
interests
created
by
the
state
law,
which
affected
the
release
from
confinement,
and
you
had
very
specific
procedures
which
directed
the
state
not
to
take
away
that
good
time,
unless
certain
conditions
existed.
then
in
the
vitek
cases,
which
we
would
identify
to
the
court
as
the
type
of
cases
that
affect
the
very
nature
of
confinement,
in
vitek
in
this
court's
affirmance
of
wright
v.
enomoto
and
then
the
hewitt
v.
helms
decision,
i
think
you're
addressing
the
kind
of
nature
of
confinement
cases
the
commonwealth
is
suggesting
to
the
court
the
line
that
ought
to
be
drawn.
we
would
recommend
another
type
of
nature
of
confinement
subject
that
might
be
involved
in
this
area
would
be
forced
medication.
forced
medication
has
not
been
addressed
by
this
court,
but
it's
the
same
kind
of
nature,
very
substantive
nature
of
a
prison's
confinement
that
addresses
very
serious
areas
that
could
affect
them
adversely
and
sort
of
fits
within
the
prison
door
concept
for
an
explanation.
and
in
those
decisions
that--
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
--i
agree
completely
with
your
honor
that
it's
not
a
very
easy
line
to
draw.
the
problem
that's
been
created
by
the
decisions
in
the
courts
below
and
in
the
district
court,
and
i
think
the
record
clearly
demonstrates
that,
is
that
if
we
don't
draw
a
line,
there's
a
very
serious
problem
for
state
officials
to
operate
their
facilities.
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
well,
there's
three...
three
areas
we're
suggesting
fall
within
this
line:
duration,
release
from
confinement,
and
then
the
very
nature
of
confinement.
and
it's...
i
agree
with
you
that
we
are...
it's--
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
--well,
i
think
forced
medication
falls
very
much
in
line
with
vitek
where
an
individual
who
does
not
want
to
receive
medication
for
a
physical
problem
is
very
much
like
an
individual
who
does
not
want
to
see...
received
medical
treatment
for
a
mental
health
problem,
and
that's
why
we
follow
those...
feel
like
those
fall
within
those
kind
of
areas.
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
well,
i
think
the
only
alternative,
your
honor,
if
we
don't
do
that,
in
order
to
aid
the
states,
is
we
would
have
to
take
a
very
restrictive,
even
more
narrow
rule
unless
the
state
drafts
policies
that
affect
substantive
rights
that
have
already
been
recognized
as
this
court
protected
by
the
constitution
itself.
to
me
that's
the
only
other
alternative
that
exists.
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
just
the
release
from
confinement?
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
i
would
have...
we...
the
state
would
have
no
objection
to
limiting
that.
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
if
we
did
that,
what
you
said?
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
that
would
satisfy
the
court
of
appeals.
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
well,
there's
two
burdens
that
exist
there.
one
is
the
administrative
burden,
but
i
think,
you
know,
that
is
a--
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
--well,
we're
not
going
to
say
that's
the
most
serious
burden
there
is.
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
i
don't
think
we're
saying
that's
the
most
serious
burden
that's
concerning
the
state
officials
here.
it
is
a
burden,
and
we
will
say
that
it
is.
but
i
think
we've
demonstrated,
correctly
demonstrated
to
this
court
over
the
hears,
whatever
this
court
wants
us
to
do,
we
can
accommodate
them.
i
mean--
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
--wolff
v....
i
beg
your
pardon?
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
the
burden
is
that
this
kind
of
ruling
subjects
state
officials
to
1983
civil
rights
damage
liability
cases
in
every
instance.
it
creates
a
civil
rights
cause
of
action
against
the
state
officials.
and
i
think
this
court
can
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
when
a
right
is
created
for
a
sentenced
felon,
it
is
pursued
very
actively
by
the
inmate,
and
because
of
the
liberal
interpretation
that
is
applied
to
pro
se
complaints,
the
state
official
are
going
to
have
to
defend
whether
or
not
they
provided
the
notice
that
was
required
by
the
court.
i
think
it's
very
clear
that
the
litigation
that
arose--
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
--no,
your
honor,
and
i
don't
think
that's
the
question
that's
presented.
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
we
didn't
interpret
the
sixth
circuit
as
finding
that
at
all.
we
interpreted
the
sixth
circuit
decision
as
finding
the
procedures
themselves,
created
the
protected
interest.
i
don't
think
that
the
sixth
circuit
ruled
that
the
consent
decree
created
that
right.
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
no,
your
honor,
the
procedures
were
already
in
place
prior
to
the
implementation
of
the
consent
decree,
and
that's
in
the
record
in
the
joint
appendix.
and
they
were
just
revised
throughout
the
years.
but
they
were
not
promulgated
pursuant
to
the
consent
decree.
we
would
agree
to
continue
those.
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
that's
correct.
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
we
can
change
them,
as
long
as
we
don't
substantively
change
them
so
that
we
deny
inmates
visits
at
those
two
institutions.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder--
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
--no,
your
honor.
we
don't
think
that
it
does,
and
we
would
advise
the
court
that
the
respondents
didn't
think
it
did
when
they
filed
their
motion
in
district
courts.
if
you
read
the
respondents'
motion
in
district
court,
they
argued
that
the
procedures
were
so
vague,
they
allowed
absolute
discretion.
and
our
position
is
if
you
have
a
procedure
that
limits
discretion
just
because
you
want
to
protect
the
security
of
the
institution
is
not
so
mandatory
in
nature
that
it's
limited
its
discretion
to
the
extent
that
it's
created
an
interest.
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
a
plaintiff
class
of
inmates
at
the
kentucky
state
reformatory.
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
not...
not
with
respect
to
the
parties.
it
applied
to
the
reformatory.
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
it
concerns
the
reformatory
inmates.
it
applies
to
them,
the
inmates
at
the
reformatory.
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
your
honor,
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
that
in
the
consent
decree,
although
the
parties
did
agree
to
continue
open
visitation
and
maintain
visitation
at
their
current
level,
the
parties...
the
attorneys
for
the
respondents
agreed
to
the
procedures
that
were
in
place
at
the
time.
the
procedures
that
were
in
place
at
the
time
were
not
changed
for
over
six
years
until
the
motion
was
filed.
never
required
any
kind
of
hearing
when
we
denied
a
visitor.
and
i
think
that's
very
important.
that
was
also
in
place
at
the
signing
of
the
consent
decree.
so,
there
was
no
requirement
agreed
to
by
the
parties
to
have
a
due
process
hearing
before
any
party
was
denied
visiting
at
the
institution,
and
that
was
in
place
at
the
time
we
signed
the
consent
decree,
and
that
was
agreed
to
by
parties
on
both
sides.
this
did
not
come
up
until
six
years
later
after
the
consent
decree
was
signed.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
rule
that
the
consent
decree
was
the
motivating
force
for
the
finding
of
the
mandatory
procedures
that
gave
rise
to
the
rights.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
it
was
the
procedures
themselves
that
contained
the
language
that
gave
rise
to
the
liberty
interests
that
requires
the
implementation
of
the
due
process
clause.
and
i
think,
more
importantly,
it
is
necessary
for
this
court
to
draw
the
line
because
of
the
burden
that
is
going
to
be
imposed
on
state
of
officials
if
this
analysis
is
continued
in
the
manner
in
which
it's
being
applied
below
now.
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
that's
correct.
ms.
barbara
willett
jones
there's
a
staff
person,
a
line
officer
there.
if
the
staff
person
believes
that
there
is
some
problem,
then
he
notifies
the
duty
officer
and
the
duty
officer
makes
the
decision
on
whether
to
deny
the
visit.
but
there
is
no
list
of
permissible
visitors.
that's
what
open
visitation
is.
anyone
can
come
during
those
hours
to
visit
that
inmate.
i
think
it's
limited
by
numbers
and
numbers
of
adults
and
unlimited
children,
but
they
may
show
up
during
the
hours
of
visiting.
therefore,
we
request
that
this
court
seriously
consider
drawing
some
distinctions
between
daily
management
procedures
and
those
procedures
which
affect
substantive
nature
of
confinement,
release
from
confinement
and
the
very
duration
of
confinement.
thank
you,
your
honor.
