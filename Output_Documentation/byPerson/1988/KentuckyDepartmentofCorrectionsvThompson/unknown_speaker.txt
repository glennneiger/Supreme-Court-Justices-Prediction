unknown
speaker
what
do
you
include
in
that
last
category?
it
isn't
clear
to
me
what
you
have
in
mind--
unknown
speaker
--with
the
nature
of
confinement.
unknown
speaker
solitary
confinement?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
the
argument
of
the
other
side
is
that
having
family
visitors
is
so
vitally
important
in
terms
of
a
prisoner's
existence,
that
it
alters
the
nature
of
the
confinement.
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
denial
were
totally
arbitrary?
the
guard
doesn't
like
prisoner
x
and
says,
"i'm
just
not
going
to
let
you
have
any
visitors."
unknown
speaker
so,
you
concede
that
some
deprivation
of
visitors
could
arise
or
could
amount
to
an
eighth
amendment
violation?
unknown
speaker
so...
so
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
covers
more
ground
than
due
process?
unknown
speaker
mrs.
jones--
--what
you're
talking
about
here
is
really
state-created
rights,
isn't
it,
and
not
rights
that
stem
from
the
constitution
themselves?
unknown
speaker
mrs.
jones,
why
do
you
have
to
use
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause
to
answer
justice
o'connor's
problem?
why
wouldn't
the
equal
protection
clause
cover
that
situation
if
the
rules
are
intentionally
applied
in
a...
in
an
unreasonable
manner
against
a
particular
prisoner?
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
the
state
can
do
anything
it
wants
to
me
and
treat
me
differently
from
the
rest
of
society
unless
i'm
a
member
of
a
suspect
class?
i
didn't
understand
that.
i
hope
it's
not
true.
unknown
speaker
oh,
but
is
that
true
of
the
particular
rights
at
stake
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
your
position
that
the...
if
the
prison
officials
want
to
do
so,
they
can
just
deny,
say,
the
inmate's
mother
or
his
wife
or
some
friend
visiting
privileges
and
never
even
tell
the
inmate.
unknown
speaker
and
you...
and
you
don't
even
have
to
give
the
inmate
notice
that...
telling
him
whether
or
not
his
wife
has
tried
to
see
him
or
not.
you
just...
it's
just
one
of
those
minor
details
of
prison
management
the
prisoner
has
no
rights
in.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
you
are.
you're
saying
there
no
constitutional
right
at
all.
unknown
speaker
and
you're
saying
you
have
a
right
to
promulgate
no
regulations
at
all.
therefore,
the
rights
you're
seeking
to
vindicate...
is
one
to
simply
say
i'm
sorry,
i
know
you're
curious,
but
we're
not
going
to
tell
you.
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
unless
it
becomes
cruel
and
unusual
and
violates
the
eighth
amendment.
that's
the
limitation?
unknown
speaker
well,
mrs.
jones,
isn't
there
a
possible
third
solution,
like
in
your
library...
to
simply
reword
the
regulation
so
that
it's...
it's...
gives
some
more
discretion
to
the
officials.
maybe,
this
isn't
what
you
really
want
to
do,
but
certainly
that
would
avoid
the
conclusion
that
it
creates
a
liberty
interest.
unknown
speaker
and
probably
not
the
purpose
of
the
consent
decree.
unknown
speaker
well,
but...
you're
talking
about
a
federally
protected
right.
are
we
still
talking
about
a
right
created
by
these
regulations?
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
it's
not...
it's
not
really
a
federally
created
right.
unknown
speaker
but
i
take
it
you
would
like
to
carve
out
some
of
these
and
get
less
federal
supervision.
unknown
speaker
so,
you
don't
want
it
limited
to
rules
and
regulations
that
affect
the
basic
type
of
incarceration
or
the
time,
the
length
of
incarceration?
unknown
speaker
what
else?
unknown
speaker
that...
that
affects
the
length
of
time?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
door
between
the
visitors'
room
and
the
general
population?
unknown
speaker
that's
a
different
kind
of
prison
door.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
you
could...
you
must
acknowledge
some
visitors
are
more
important
than
others.
unknown
speaker
you
could
send
in
a
prison
guard
to
visit
with
them
for
a
little
while,
then,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
administrative
segregation?
i
mean,
i
thought
that's
what
administrative
segregation
was,
where
you
put
somebody
off
where
he
couldn't
have
visitor
privileges
at
all...
even
to
see
other...
i
mean,
solitary
confinement,
for
example.
unknown
speaker
and
you
acknowledge
that,
that,
that
you
have
to
give
a
hearing
for
that?
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
you
were
trying
to
give
us
a
subject
matter
line,
a
clear
subject
matter
line
that
related
to
doors
or
whatever.
unknown
speaker
mrs.
jones,
does
the
visitor
have
a
liberty
interest?
unknown
speaker
so,
your
distinction...
you
began
with
this...
something
that
affects
the
nature
of
the
confinement,
as
opposed
to
routine
administration?
unknown
speaker
what's
the
constitutional
principle
or
premise
that
underlies
that
distinction?
unknown
speaker
just
the
important
versus
unimportant
or--
unknown
speaker
--i
don't--
--well,
this
isn't
an
easy
line
to
draw.
you're...
it
boils
down
to
what's
serious
or
not
serious,
and
i'm
not
sure
how
we
derive
that
from
the
language
of
the
due
process
clause.
unknown
speaker
your
line
seems
to
wavy.
i
mean,
how...
why
does
forced
medication
once
you've
been
committed
to
prison
affect
the
nature
and
duration
of
the
sentence
or
the
confinement?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
go
into
the
very
nature
of
confinement?
i
mean,
there
you're
just
getting
a
lot
of
judgment
calls,
it
seems
to
me.
you
know,
forced
medication
is
worse
than
being
denied
visitors?
who
can
say?
unknown
speaker
oh,
we
understand
why
you've
adopted
it.
i
mean,
it
very
nicely
brings
all
existing
cases
within
your
role.
we're
just
asking
whether
it's
a
line
that
makes
any
sense.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
would
do
away
with
the
roth
case
and
the
whole
idea
of
liberty
and
interests
created
by
state
legislation.
why
not
limit
yourself
to
the
duration
or
the
confinement?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
no,
i'm
sure
they
wouldn't.
may
i...
may
i
go
back
for
a
second
to
this
particular
case.
under
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
here,
if
you...
you're
supposed
to
draft
regulations
covering
this
problem.
if
your
regulations...
if
you
drafted
a
regulation
that
said
whenever
a
particular
person
is
going
to
be
denied
the
privilege
of
visiting
inmates,
the
inmate
shall
receive
notice,
written
notice
of
that
fact
and
an
explanation
of
the
reason,
period.
do
you
think
that
would
satisfy
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
yeah,
you
just
set
a
regulation.
whenever
we
deny
somebody
visitation
privileges,
we'll
tell
the
inmate
and
tell
them
why?
unknown
speaker
but
it's
too
much
of
a
burden
on
the
state,
i
gather,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
seem
very
serious
to
me.
unknown
speaker
you're
afraid
he
might...
if
you
deny
him
library
privilege,
you
might
have
to
write
him
a
note
and
say
we
denied
you
library
privileges
because
you
didn't
return
that
book
or
something
like
that?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
it
isn't
serious?
unknown
speaker
i
think
they
made
a
mistake
there.
have
we
ever
held
that
regulations
promulgated
pursuant
to
a
consent
decree
can
create
liberty
interests?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
didn't
you
present
it?
i
mean,
why
do
you
accept
the
conclusion
of
the
sixth
circuit
that
regulations
promulgated
pursuant
to
a
consent
decree
can
create
the
same
sort
of
liberty
interests
that
regulations
voluntarily
promulgated
by
the
state
can
create.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
procedures
were
promulgated
pursuant
to
the
consent
decree,
weren't
they?
unknown
speaker
you
did
get
a--
--that
was
part
of
the
consent
decree,
wasn't
it,
that
you...
you
agreed
to
continue
those?
unknown
speaker
so
you
weren't...
you
weren't
very...
in
very
good
shape
to
change
them?
unknown
speaker
just
one
question.
assume
for
the
moment
that
we
hold
that
a
constitutionally
protected
right
in
visitation
can
be
created.
did
this
regulation
have
sufficiently
specific
and
mandatory
regulation
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
who
were
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
and
was
the
remand...
was
there
any
doubt
that
this
rule
applied
to
that,
to
the
reformatory?
unknown
speaker
so,
the
remand
doesn't
really
concern
these
people?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mrs.
jones.
mr.
elder.
unknown
speaker
is
this
a
class
action?
unknown
speaker
and
are
any
of
the
named
plaintiffs
still
incarcerated?
unknown
speaker
is
it
possible,
then,
that
this
is
moot?
unknown
speaker
and
so
that
the
right
here
does
arise
out
of
the
consent
decree?
unknown
speaker
what's
the
consent
decree
got
to
do
with
the
possible
mootness
problem?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
these...
the
plaintiffs
here
were...
were
claiming
that
these
regulations
which
were
in
place
before
the
decree
and
after
the
decree
are
being
administered
in
a
way
that
is
unconstitutional.
and
here
the
plaintiff...
suppose
it
hadn't
been
a
class
action
and
the
plaintiff
had
died?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
here's...
here's
a...
suppose
it
hadn't
been
a
class
action
and
the
single
plaintiff
had
been...
was
out
of
prison?
unknown
speaker
and
all
he'd
wanted
was
an
injunction.
unknown
speaker
so,
it
is
a
class
action?
unknown
speaker
but
it
has
to
be
capable
of
evading
review
with
respect
to
these
particular
people,
not
with
respect...
just
with
respect
to
other
plaintiff.
unknown
speaker
supposing
that
all
the
named
members
of
the
class
were
now
walking
the
streets
of
frankfort
or
lexington
or
louisville,
out
of
prison.
the
consent
decree
would
no
longer
bind,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
but
you
can't...
you
can't
bind
in,
in
a
decree
where
there
are
individual
plaintiffs
or
plaintiffs
representing
a
class.
you
have
a
consent
decree,
and
all
those
plaintiffs
eventually
disappear,
isn't
that
end
of
the
decree?
unknown
speaker
but
if
it's
moot
under
our
case
law,
whether
the
defendants
think
it
binds
them
really
doesn't
make
any
difference.
unknown
speaker
that
was
moot--
--the
class
can
include
the
future?
unknown
speaker
in
the
future?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
the
decree--
unknown
speaker
--there's
no
lives
in
being
plus
21
years
kind
of
limitation
to
these
consent
decrees?
they
just
go
on
and
on
and
on--
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
--like
the
mississippi?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--but
why
don't
you
take
the
position
that
under
the
rules
and
the
information
that
we
have
on
recidivism
that
one
of
them,
at
least,
is
back
in
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
is...
is
some
part...
is
some
part
of
your
case
here
saying
that
these
hearings
should
take
place
on
remand,
these
procedures,
based
on
the
consent
decree?
unknown
speaker
you've
said...
it
was
in
part...
you
said,
the
sixth
circuit
was?
unknown
speaker
have
we
ever
held
that
a
consent...
regulations
issued
pursuant
to
a
consent
decree
or
a
consent
decree
itself
can
create
a
so-called
liberty
interest?
unknown
speaker
if
you
got
it
entirely
out
of
the
consent
decree,
i
suppose
you
wouldn't
have
to
worry
about
a
liberty
interest
or
something
like
that
if
the
consent
decree
binds
all
the
parties,
and
it
says
this
is
what
you'll
do,
you'll
go
ahead
and
do
it
unless
you
get
the
consent
decree
set
aside.
unknown
speaker
that
isn't
the
way
the
sixth
circuit
looked
at
it.
unknown
speaker
how
did
the
state
create
this
right?
unknown
speaker
to
get
that
in
real
life.
i
mean,
if
the
library
decides
to
revoke
your
library
privileges,
you
don't
necessarily
get
a
hearing.
unknown
speaker
why
should
you
get
one
in
prison?
unknown
speaker
well,
under
your
theory
it
would,
though.
unknown
speaker
under
your
theory,
as
we
understand
it,
it
would
create
exactly
that,
a
1983
cause
of
action,
attorneys'
fees,
and
the
whole
bit.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that...
is
that
the
test
of
our
cases,
that
a...
hearings
are
granted
when
they
create
some
ancillary
benefit?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
it
was
a
predicate
right
that
the
hearing
was
designed
to
enforce.
unknown
speaker
does
that
satisfy
you?
unknown
speaker
and
if
you
found
out
the
warden
was
just
taking
that
note
and
not
even
reading
it,
chucking
it
in
the
wastebasket
you
wouldn't
be
back
here
saying
now
wait
a
minute.
you
have
to...
you
have
to
consider
the
note,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
and
don't
you
have
to
investigate
whether
it's
correct
that
it
was
so
and
so
instead
of...
right?
unknown
speaker
oh,
but
he'd
have
to
look
into
the
matter.
wouldn't
the
warden
have
to
look
into
the
matter?
unknown
speaker
legal
duty.
unknown
speaker
oh,
it's
not
nothings.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
prison
doesn't
have
to
allow
any
visits.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
did
judge
johnstone
enter
a
decree
that
wasn't
based
on
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
what
provision
of
the
constitution
authorized
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
what
was...
how
did
it
ever
get
included
in
a
decree
that
presumably
is
based
solely
on
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--you
regard
the
consent
decree
kind
of
as
just
a
basic
decree
trying
to
create
a
good
prison
atmosphere
and
apply
good
penal
principles?
unknown
speaker
it's
an
interesting
theory.
mr.
elder,
could
you
tell
me
whether
you
agree
with
mrs.
jones
about
what
happens
if...
if
a
particular
inmate...
let's
assume
there's
no
due
process
hearing,
but
a
particular
inmate
believes
that,
in
fact,
he's
being
picked
on.
for
some
reason,
he
has
been
singled
out.
would
he
have
any
constitutional
remedy
at
all?
unknown
speaker
intentionally
with
regard
to
visitation.
he
alone
is
not
allowed
to
see
any
of
his
relatives.
what,
what--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
ask
another
question
about
her
submission.
she's
concerned
and
correctly
so
in
view
of
the
1983
litigation
possibilities
of
liability
by
a
guard
who
might
have
forgotten
to
give
notice
or
something
like
that.
would
you...
what
would
your
view
be
on
the
question
of
whether
if
you
set
up
these
procedures,
very
minimal
procedures,
and
then
nobody
did
give
an
inmate
notice
that
his
mother
couldn't
visit
for
the
next
six
months,
would
he
be
able
to
recover
damages?
unknown
speaker
but,
now,
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question
along
the
lines
that
i
was
asking
you
before.
basically
any
federal
court
decree
laying
down
rules
for
a
federal
prison
is
based
on
the
constitution,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
what
business
does
any
court
decree
have
laying
down
rules
for
the
operation
of
a
prison
in
a
federal
court
that
isn't
based
on
a...
some
sort
of
constitutional
right
of
the
prisoners?
unknown
speaker
what's,
what's
the
basis
for
that?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
the
judge
have
to
look
at
the
decree,
though,
and
make
sure
that
it's
the
kind
of
thing
he
has
jurisdiction
to
enter?
unknown
speaker
what
about
in
a
litigated
decree?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
in
this
case
we're
talking
about
procedural
due
process,
are
we
not?
unknown
speaker
and
i
thought
the
rationale
of
those
cases
was
that
the
state
is
omitting
the
constitutional
duty
if
it
doesn't
provide
a
procedure.
unknown
speaker
but
doesn't
the
consent
decree
automatically
have
its
own
procedure?
unknown
speaker
well,
didn't
you
allege
a
violation
of
the
consent
decree
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
were
in
the
consent
decree
hearings,
weren't
you?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--this
wasn't
a
separate
1983
suit?
unknown
speaker
but
the
court
then...
you...
you're
invoking
a
mechanism
which
has
very
sophisticated
procedure,
