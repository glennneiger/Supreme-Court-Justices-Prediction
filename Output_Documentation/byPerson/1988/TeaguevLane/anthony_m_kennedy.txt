justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
take
it,
under
your
sixth
amendment
theory,
you
want
a
jury
that's
representative
of
the
community
at
large,
which
would
include
representative
numbers
of
race,
gender,
i
take
it
wealth?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
at
what
point
do
you
test
whether
or
not
this
jury
has
been
selected?
there
are
12
jurors
in
the
box,
and
there
is
on
peremptory
challenge,
and
it
happens
to
be
a
wealthy
woman.
do
we
immediately
begin
looking
at
the
composition
of
the
community,
or
do
we
have
to
wait
until
the
jury
has
been
selected?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
have
to
wait
until
all
of
the
peremptory
challenges
have
been
exercised
before
you
can
determine
whether
the
constitution
has
been
in
violation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
at
that
point,
you'd
simply
have
to
select
an
entirely
new
jury,
i
take
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you're
proposing
a
standard
where
the
judge
could
not
make
rulings
on
a
challenge
by
challenge
basis?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
have
a
case
of
a
white
civil
rights
worker
who's
been
beaten
and
he
is
the
victim,
and
whites
are
being
tried,
can
blacks
be
stricken
from
the
jury?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
consistent
with
batson
and
consistent
with
the
sixth
amendment.
