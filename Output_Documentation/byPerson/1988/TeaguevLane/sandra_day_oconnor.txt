justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
unsinn,
may
i
interrupt
you
there
to
inquire
whether...
if
this
court
were
to
adopt
the
other
part
of
justice
harlan's
view
of
retroactivity
on
collateral
review,
whether
we
would
be
able
to
reach
your
sixth
amendment
argument
at
all?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why?
this
comes
to
us
on
federal
habeas,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
under
justice
harlan's
view,
any
new
right
recognized
wouldn't
be
retroactive.
and
wouldn't
we
just
be
rendering
an
advisory
opinion,
then,
on
the
sixth
amendment
question
if
we
were
to
adopt
that
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
suppose
we
continue
to
follow
our
holding
in
allen
against
hardy,
rather
than
your
view
of
when
that
rule
was
adopted.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
forcing
parties
to
a
lawsuit
to
accept
jurors
of
a
certain
racial
composition...
italian
background,
or
hispanic
in
certain
parts
of
the
country,
or
whatever
it
might
be...
on
the
basis
of
their
race
or
their
religion
at
the
petit
jury
level
might
work
at
cross
purposes
with
the
goal
of
giving
parties
through
the
peremptory
challenge
the
right
to
obtain
a
degree
of
impartiality,
in
effect?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
ms.
unsinn,
under...
if
your
client
were
being
tried
today,
by
virtue
of
batson
against
kentucky,
this
situation
that
you're
complaining
about
couldn't
occur,
i
assume.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
would
succeed
under
our
holding,
this
court's
holding
in
batson.
the
problem
is
that
we
did
not
apply
batson
retroactively
to
cases
that
were
final
when
it
was
handed
down,
and
your
client's
case
was
final,
was
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
lower
courts
have
gone
considerably
further
in
identifying
other
groups,
i
take
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
i
had
spotted
a
number
in
the
cases
around
the
country.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
pretty
much
limitless,
actually.
this
court
has
previously
refused
to
take
this
step,
and
extend
the
fair
cross
section
requirement
to
the
petit
jury,
has
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
suppose
that
our
jury
size
case...
was
it
ballew
v.
georgia,
did
rely
in
part
on
the
fair
cross
section
concept
in
saying
you
can't
reduce
the
petit
jury
size
beyond
a
certain
level.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
apparently
there
is
some
concern,
then,
with
fair
cross
section
at
the
petit
jury
level?
