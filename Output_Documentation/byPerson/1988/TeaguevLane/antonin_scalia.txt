justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
you
made
some
assumptions
based
on
group
identity.
you
struck
a
woman
from
the
jury
on
no
basis,
other
than
the
fact
that
she
belonged
to
the
group
of
wives
of
policemen.
isn't
that
the
way
peremptory
challenges
are
always
used,
making
generalizations
about
groups
which
may
well
be
wrong,
but
you
play
the
odds,
and
that's
the
basis
on
which
you
use
them.
isn't
that
done
all
the
time?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
about,
let's
say,
a
trial
concerning
a
killing
that
has
become
a
racial
incident
in
the
community
in
question,
and
let's
assume
that
it's
a
group
of
young
white
men
who
have
caused
the
death
of
a
black
man.
and
the
defense,
or
the
prosecution,
attempts
to
strike
from
the
jury
all
whites,
if
possible,
thinking
that
the
racial
tensions
in
the
community
would
make
then
tend
to
vote
against
his
client.
is
that
no
good?
or
it's
only
okay
because
the
defense
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
no
individual
basis,
it
just
knows
that
this
matter
in
the
newspapers
and
elsewhere
has
just
polarized
the
races
in
the
community...
just
to
be
sure,
if
i
can,
i
would
like
to
keep
as
many
whites
as
possible
off
the
jury.
you're
saying
i
wouldn't
be
able
to
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
interest
the
defendant
can
have
is
the
interest
in
impartiality,
i
would
assume,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
saying
that
some
impartial
juries
are
more
impartial
than
others?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
you're
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
unless
that's
true,
the
peremptory
challenge
doesn't
have
any
purpose
at
all,
or
any
purpose
that
serves
the
society.
justice
antonin
scalia
enables
you
to
get
a
really
impartial
jury?
not
just
impartial,
but
really
impartial,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
you
could
explain
batson
without
reference
to
in
impartiality
objection
by
just
saying
that
a
person
is
entitled
to
whatever
partiality
would
be
created
by
the
inclusion
of
members
of
his
race
on
the
jury,
if
the
society
at
large
has
that
proportion?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
make
it
purely
an
equal
protection
decision,
having
nothing
to
do
with
impartiality.
you're
entitled
even
to
the
benefit
of
somewhat
partial
juries,
who
happen
to
share
your
race
or
whatever
other
characteristic.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
government
doesn't
have
an
obligation
to
provide
an
impartial
jury?
all
it
has
an
obligation
to
is
not
affirmatively
to
cause
a
less
than
impartial
jury?
justice
antonin
scalia
gee,
i
thought
it
had
an
obligation
to
provide
an
impartial
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
says
here
that
in
all
criminal
prosecutions,
the
accused
shall
enjoy
the
right
to
a
speedy
and
public
trial
by
an
impartial
jury.
not
by
what
might
have
been,
or
what
there
was
a
possibility
of
being
an
impartial
jury.
and
as
i
read
that,
if
a
cross
section
is
necessary
for
impartiality,
then
it
isn't
enough
that
the
state
merely
refrain
from
causing
impartiality,
less
than
impartiality.
the
state
has
a
positive
obligation
to
ensure
a
cross
section.
doesn't
that
follow?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
cross
section
is
necessary
for
impartial,
then
the
state
must
produce
a
cross
section.
period.
