mr.
david
e.
bindi
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
your
honors,
the
petitioner
invokes
the
sixth
amendment
as
the
constitutional
basis
for
the
relief
he
seeks
in
this
case.
the
core
guarantee
of
the
sixth
amendment
is
the
right
to
an
impartial
jury,
but
the
petitioner
does
not
contend
that
he
did
not
get
an
impartial
jury
in
this
case.
what
he
does
contend
is
that
he
did
not
get
a
jury
which
was
representative
of
a
cross
section
of
the
community
because
the
peremptory
challenge
was
used
with
the
result
that
one
distinctive
group
within
the
community
did
not
ultimately
participate
in
the
jury's
deliberations.
your
honors,
the
petitioner's
argument
blurs
the
distinction
between
cross
sectionalism
and
impartiality,
and
it
is
absolutely
crucial
to
remember
that
they
are
not
the
same
thing.
in
lockhart
v.
mccree,
this
court
defined
impartiality,
for
purposes
of
analysis
of
a
jury,
in
terms
of
a
jury
consisting
of
individuals,
each
of
whom
was
willing
to
consider
the
case
fairly
and
to
render
a
decision
based
on
the
evidence,
and
not
on
extraneous
or
irrelevant
influences.
the
court
also
specifically
rejected
the
notion
that
jury
impartiality
can
be
determined
with
reference
to
some
hypothetical
mix
of
viewpoints
from
within
the
community
on
the
petit
jury
itself.
i
don't
mean
for
any
of
this
to
imply
that
the
respondents
are
denigrating
the
cross
section
principle.
the
cross
section
principle
does
serve
a
very
valuable
purpose
in
the
jury
trial
system.
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
cross
section
principle
is
a
protective
measure,
and
it
was
designed
to
enhance
the
fairness
of
jury
trials.
but
the
peremptory
challenge
does
that
too.
the
peremptory
challenge
serves
as
a
backstop
to
the
process
of
voir
dire
examination
and
challenge
for
cause,
and
it
also
serves
to
ensure
that
the
jury
which
is
ultimately
selected
is
one
that
is
composed
of
individuals
that
both
parties
are
able
to
agree
upon
as
being
the
fairest
and
most
able
to
render
a
just
verdict
from
the
choices
available.
having
a
cross
section
of
the
community
represented
in
a
petit
jury
would
be
a
good
thing
if
we
could
get
it
on
a
regular
basis.
but
a
cross
section
of
biased
and
partial
people
does
not
serve
the
ends
of
justice.
the
peremptory
challenge
may
result
in
some
juries
which
are
less
cross
sectional,
but
its
purpose
is
to
ensure
that
while
a
jury
may
be
less
cross
sectional,
it
is
nevertheless
more
fair
and
satisfactory
to
both
sides.
the
argument
has
been
made
that
if
the
cross
sectional
principle
is
not
extended
to
the
petit
jury,
that
the
beneficial
effects
of
the
holding
in
taylor
v.
louisiana--
mr.
david
e.
bindi
--your
honor,
in
a
post-batson
situation,
that
would
not
be
a
satisfactory
reply.
mr.
david
e.
bindi
well,
because
batson
stands
for
the
proposition
that
the
equal
protection
clause
does
not
permit
the
peremptory
challenges
to
be
exercised
on
the
basis
of
a
stereotypical
notion
that
jurors
of
a
particular
race
will,
in
all
cases,
be
favorable
or
more
partial
to,
a
defendant
who
is
also
a
member
of
that
same
race.
mr.
david
e.
bindi
your
honor,
yes,
i
contend
that
that's
permissible.
the
reason
is
that
the
equal
protection
clause
protects
entirely
different
interests
than
the
sixth
amendment.
as
i
said
before,
the
core
guarantee
of
the
sixth
amendment
is
impartiality,
and
it
is
not
the
purpose
of
the
sixth
amendment
to
address
problems
of
discrimination.
that
is
the
function
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
david
e.
bindi
no,
your
honor,
i
agree
that
batson
v.
kentucky
has
to
do
not
only...
and
the
language
in
the
opinion
indicates
this...
that
it
has
not
only
to
do
with
the
interests
of
the
jurors,
but
with
the
interests
of
the
defendants.
so
there
are
equal
protection
concerns
in
both
situations
in
batson.
mr.
david
e.
bindi
if
that
were
in
fact
the
case,
your
honor,
it
would
be
difficult
to
explain
batson
as
an
equal
protection
holding,
because
it
was
not
a
case
that
was
brought
by
individual
jurors
who
had
been
excused,
but
rather
by
a
criminal
defendant.
had
impartiality
been
the
court's
core
concern
in
batson
v.
kentucky,
then
i
think
it
would
be
difficult
to
explain
it
on
an
equal
protection
ground.
moreover,
i
would
also
point
out
that
in
alan
v.
hardy,
which
held
that
batson
was
not
retroactive
to
cases
which
were
final
at
the
time
it
was
decided...
there
is
language
in
that
opinion
that
indicates
that
the
decision
in
batson
had
multiple
purposes,
one
of
which
may
have
had
some
impact
on
the
truth
finding
function
of
a
jury
trial,
but
that
that
was
not
the
main
thrust
of
the
opinion.
mr.
david
e.
bindi
that's
true,
your
honor.
the
case
in
ballew
v.
georgia,
the
court
held
that
a
jury
of
five
would
be
unconstitutional,
and
it
did
rely
in
part
on--
mr.
david
e.
bindi
--absolutely,
your
honor.
i
would
not
contest
the
fact
that
cross-sectionalism
has
some
implication
for
impartiality.
the
point
to
remember,
though,
is
that
while
there
is
a
connection
between
the
two,
it
is
not
a
direct
connection.
that
is
to
say
that
cross
sectionalism
at
the
petit
jury
level
is
not
the
litmus
test
of
impartiality.
if
it
were,
then
what
the
petitioner
is
asking
the
court
to
do
is
in
fact
not
enough.
if
it
were
the
litmus
test
of
impartiality,
then
we
would
have
to
fill
juries
by
quota.
mr.
david
e.
bindi
consistent
with
the
cross
section
requirement--
mr.
david
e.
bindi
--first
of
all,
it
would
not
be
inconsistent
under
the
sixth
amendment
to
strike
jurors
on
that
basis
on
that
factual
situation.
as
to
whether
that
would
violate
the
equal
protection
clause,
this
court's
opinion
in
batson
appears
to
read
that
the
defendant
challenging
the
use
of
peremptories
by
the
prosecution
must
be
of
the
same
racial
group
as
the
stricken
jurors.
i'm
aware
of
some
lower
court
cases
that
tend
to
drift
away
from
that
sort
of
standing
requirement
that
batson
appears
to
impose,
but
nevertheless,
your
honor,
the
essential
point
here
is
that
to
the
extent
that
that
is
a
problem,
it
is
a
problem
for
equal
protection
purposes,
not
for
fair
cross
section
purposes.
because
to
equate
jury
impartiality,
which
once
again
is
what
the
sixth
amendment
is
all
about,
with
some
sort
of
mix
on
the
jury
or
representative
viewpoints
being
included
on
the
petit
jury
is
to
take
dangerous
step
toward
the
process
of
actually
being
required,
or
enforcing
a
requirement,
that
juries
be
filled
by
quota.
now,
the
argument
has
been
made
that
if
the
cross
section
requirement
is
not
extended
to
the
petit
jury,
then
taylor
v.
louisiana
will
be
rendered
a
nullity.
it's
simply
wrong
to
say
that,
your
honors.
the
fact
that
taylor
requires
that
the
jury
pool
be
all-inclusive
means
that
if,
in
a
situation
where
previously
an
entire
group
was
either
drastically
underrepresented
or
completed
excluded,
a
litigant
would
be
able,
in
a
situation
such
as
that,
to
direct
his
or
her
peremptory
challenges
against
the
next
most
disfavored
individuals
or
groups.
but
when
you
have
a
pool
which
is
all-inclusive,
then
the
peremptory
challenge
is
going
to
be
exercised
in
a
different
way
by
the
litigants,
and
it
means
that
people
who
previously
might
have
been
peremptorily
challenged
will
now
in
fact
sit
on
juries
that
they
wouldn't
have
been
on
before.
and
that
has
the
function
of
shifting
the
spectrum
of
attitude
which
actually
appears
on
the
petit
jury.
so
it
is
a
mistake
to
say
that
taylor
would
have
no
effect
whatsoever
on
the
law
if--
mr.
david
e.
bindi
--there
would
be
nothing
at
all
un-constitutional
about
that.
the
court
has
frequently
stated
that
peremptory
challenges
are
not
constitutionally
required.
mr.
david
e.
bindi
that's
true,
your
honor.
when
i
say,
however,
that
the
peremptory
challenge
serves
a
valuable
purpose
for
purposes
of
selecting
a
fair
and
impartial
jury,
i
do
not
mean
to
suggest
that
it
should
thereby
be
accorded
some
constitutional
status.
i'm
merely
pointing
out
to
the
court,
as
the
court
itself
has
frequently
recognized,
that
the
peremptory
challenge
does
serve
a
valuable
purpose.
mr.
david
e.
bindi
the
purpose
the
peremptory
challenge
serves,
your
honor--
mr.
david
e.
bindi
--pardon
me?
mr.
david
e.
bindi
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
nevertheless,
to
say
that
we
have
a
procedural
device
which
is
designed
to
further
a
goal,
but
that
that
device
does
not
have
constitutional
status,
is
not
to
say
that
to
do
away
with
the
device
would
be
un-constitutional.
mr.
david
e.
bindi
no,
your
honor,
i
don't--
mr.
david
e.
bindi
--i
don't
believe
that
that's
what
our
position
leads
to.
mr.
david
e.
bindi
well,
again,
the
purpose
the
peremptory
challenge
serves
is
first
of
all,
because
the
process
of
voir
dire
examination
and
cause
challenge
has
its
limitations,
the
peremptory
serves
as
a
backstop.
we
all
recognize
that
voir
dire
examination,
as
it's
currently
conducted,
is
not
a
tremendously
extensive
thing,
and
we
also
recognize
that
jurors,
even
those
jurors
who
admit
to
some
sort
of
bias,
but
swear
under
oath
that
they
could
lay
it
aside
for
purposes
of
deciding
this
case,
are
not
subject
to
challenge
for
cause
in
most
states.
so
the
peremptory
challenge
serves--
mr.
david
e.
bindi
--well,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
it's
necessary
to
go
that
far.
but
if--
mr.
david
e.
bindi
--well,
even
assuming
that
to
be
the
case,
your
honor,
the
fact
that
a
peremptory
challenge
serves,
or
works
to
produce
impartial
juries
or
better
juries
is
in
fact
not
inconsistent
with
the
respondents'
position.
in
fact,
that
is
part
of
what
the
respondents'
position
is.
we
also
agree
that
the
cross
section
requirement
serves
to
enhance
impartiality.
so
what
we're
faced
with
here
is
really
a
situation
where
we
have
two
procedural
devices
which
are
directed
at
enhancing
the
same
ultimate
goal.
the
petitioner's
position
is
that
when
the
two
come
into
conflict,
the
one
which
is
recognized
as
constitutionally
grounded
must
overcome
the
one
that
is
not.
however,
i
think
that
that
argument
begs
the
question,
because
we
still
haven't
recognized
that
the
cross
section
requirement
as
applied
to
the
petit
jury
is
something
that's
constitutionally
necessary--
mr.
david
e.
bindi
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
to
some
extent,
it
does.
but,
i
do
not
believe
that
that
was
the
main
thrust
of
the
court's--
mr.
david
e.
bindi
--to
have--
mr.
david
e.
bindi
--well,
the
court's
opinion
certainly
didn't
lean
that
way,
your
honor,
and
in
fact,
although
the
sixth
amendment
was
the
constitutional
framework
urged
by
the
defendant
in
batson
on
the
court,
the
court
nevertheless
selected
the
equal
protection
clause
as
providing
the
more
appropriate
constitutional
basis
for
doing
the
job
that
the
court
felt
had
to
be
done.
part
of
the
rationale
of
batson
for
not
relying
explicitly
on
a
sixth
amendment
basis
is
that
the
concept
of
applying
some
sort
of
theory
of
proportional
representation
at
the
petit
jury
stage
is
completely
impractical.
in
fact,
it
would
be
a
impossible
to
accomplish.
mr.
david
e.
bindi
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
there
is
a
solid,
theoretical
basis
for
saying
that
a
rule
which
encourages
one
group
participation
in
a
jury
trial
fosters
impartiality,
but
other...
a
different
rule
encouraging
participation
by
other,
equally
distinctive
and
recognized
groups
in
the
community
would
not.
mr.
david
e.
bindi
well,
i
think
that--
mr.
david
e.
bindi
--well,
i
don't
disagree
with
that
your
honor.
i
agree
that...
but
again
it's
important
to
note
the
language
in
allen
v.
hardy,
which
indicates
that
while
the
rule
of
batson
has
an
incidental
or
residual
effect
on
jury
impartiality,
it
was
not
that...
that
idea
was
not
the
main
thrust
of
the
batson
opinion,
and
was
not
the
main
goal
that
the
court
was
seeking
to
promote.
batson,
i
think,
also
recognizes
the
fact
that
applying
a
concept
of
proportional
representation
at
the
petit
jury
level
is
a
virtual
impossibility.
batson
indicates
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
get
any
trial
jury
to
proportionally
reflect
all
of
the
various
and
distinctive
groups
from
within
the
community,
because
of
the
heterogeneous
nature
of
our
society.
now,
this
leads...
if
the
petitioner's
position
were
to
be
adopted,
this
would
lead
to
two
very
immediate
and
very
serious
problems.
the
first
problem
would
be
defining
what
groups
are
cognizable.
the
petitioner
has
indicated
this
afternoon,
and
i
agree,
that
this
court's
previous
cases
have
held
that
groups
defined
by
race,
gender
and
ethnic
origin
are
cognizable
groups...
but
this
court's
opinions
have
suggested,
and
many
lower
courts
have
found,
that
groups
defined
also
by
economic
or
political
or
occupational
status
are
cognizable.
that
groups
defined
by
religion
or
age
or
geographic
location
are
all
cognizable.
the
point
is
that
whether
or
not
a
group
would
be
cognizable
for
purposes
of
a
cross
section
analysis
is
a
question
of
fact.
to
determine
that
question,
trial
courts
would
be
required
to
hold
evidentiary
hearings
at
which
demographic
and
sociological
studies
would
have
to
be
produced.
and
this
of
course
would
impose
a
tremendous
burden
on
our
already
overburdened
trial
courts.
furthermore,
the
results
of
any
such
hearings
would
be
transient,
because
the
population
is
transient.
a
ruling
today
that
some
group
is
or
is
not
cognizable
in
a
certain
time
and
a
certain
location
in
a
certain
community
might
not
be
a
valid
opinion
five
years
from
now,
so
this
would
be
a
recurring,
a
constantly
recurring
thing
that
the
trial
courts
would
have
to
engage
in.
moreover,
since
it
is
impossible
to
get
a
literal
cross
section
of
the
community
on
any
one
trial
jury,
a
defendant
could
almost
always
object
to
the
composition
of
a
jury
on
the
basis
of
the
absence
or
underrepresentation
of
one
group
or
another,
following
jury
selection.
mr.
david
e.
bindi
i
don't
believe
that
any
example
would
fit
that,
your
honor.
again--
mr.
david
e.
bindi
--well,
except
again,
your
honor,
that
the
court
has
defined
impartiality
in
terms
other
than
that,
and
has
indicated
that
impartiality
is
not
to
be
considered
a
function
of
group
interaction
or...
maybe
that's
going
too
far.
it's
not
to
be
considered
a
function
of
getting
a
mix
of
particular
kinds
of
viewpoints
on
the
jury.
even
in
batson
v.
kentucky,
the
court
acknowledged
that
trial
of
a
black
defendant
by
an
all-white
jury
does
not
necessary
result
in
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
concomitantly,
i
would
say
that
it
certainly
doesn't
necessarily
violate
the
right
to
a
trial
by
an
impartial
jury.
mr.
david
e.
bindi
i
have
no
doubt
that
that's
the
case,
your
honor,
although
i'm
not--
mr.
david
e.
bindi
--that's
entirely--
mr.
david
e.
bindi
--i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question,
your
honor.
mr.
david
e.
bindi
both
sides
agree,
your
honors,
that
if
the
extension
of
this
principle
to
the
petit
jury
is
necessary,
that
the
defendant
should
be
limited
as
well
as
the
prosecution.
now,
if
that
would
not
outright
destroy
the
value
of
the
peremptory
challenge,
it
would
at
least
destroy
the
peremptory
of,
or
strip
the
peremptory
of
any
beneficial
effect
that
it's
intended
to
have
on
jury
trials.
it
would
hinder
both
sides
in
their
ability
to
remove
whatever
bias
is
not
excluded
during
the
process
of
voir
dire
examination
and
cause
challenge.
it
would
undermine
the
confidence
of
the
parties
in
the
fairness
of
the
jury
that
they
have
to
try
their
case,
and
it
would
do
all
this
without
necessarily
having
any
promotional
impact
or
the
impartiality
of
the
jury
trial
system.
finally,
your
honors,
i
would
point
out
that
the
impracticality
of
implementing
some
form
of
proportional
representation
at
the
petit
jury
stage
is,
i
believe,
excellently
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
there
is
a
tremendous
divergence
of
opinion
as
to
exactly
what
purpose
the
cross
section
principle
ought
to
have
at
the
petit
jury
stage,
and
how
such
a
principle
ought
to
be
implemented
there.
prior
to
the
grant
of
certiorari
in
this
case,
there
was
a
body
of
case
law
that
had
been
developing
over
the
past
10
years
in
the
state
courts
and
in
two
federal
circuits
purporting
to
apply
cross
section
principles
to
the
petit
jury
selection
stage.
the
petitioner
relies
on
none
of
that
case
law,
and
our
brief
demonstrated
why
that--
mr.
david
e.
bindi
--if
you
accept
the
proposition
that
if
not
cross
sectionalism,
at
least
representation
by
some
particular
group
in
the
context
of
a
particular
case
is
an
absolute
essential
component
of
impartiality,
then
yes,
your
honor,
that's
absolutely
correct.
you
would
have
to
fill
a
certain
number
of
seats
on
that
jury
by
quota.
your
honors,
for
all
these
reasons,
and
for
those
contained
in
our
brief,
we
would
respectfully
request
that
the
court
affirm
the
judgement
of
the
court
of
appeals.
thank
you.
