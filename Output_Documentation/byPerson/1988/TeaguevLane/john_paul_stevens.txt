justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
here?
do
you
think
the
rule
of
the
batson
case,
which
in
essence
says
that
the
prosecutor
may
not
exclude
a
racial
category
of
jurors
by
exercising
peremptory
challenge...
do
you
think
that
rule
serves
the
interest
in
impartiality?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
it
does
even
to
a
little
extent,
why
doesn't
that...
if
you
just
look
at
the
language
of
the
sixth
amendment...
mean
that
it
serves
the
purpose
of
the
sixth
amendment,
to
get
an
impartial
jury?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
rule
of
batson
furthers
the
purpose,
at
least,
of
the
sixth
amendment,
which
seeks
to
have
defendants
tried
by
impartial
juries.
and
if
this
rule
that
we
announced
in
batson
serves
the
same
purpose,
why
isn't
it
therefore
partially
grounded
on
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
may
be
that
the
cross
section
requirement
would
be
impractical,
and
all
that.
but
i'm
not
asking
about
cross
sectional.
i'm
just
asking
about
the
language
of
the
sixth
amendment,
which
does
require
that
the
jury
be
impartial.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
rule
of
the
batson
case
serves
precisely
the
same
interests.
it
might
not
apply
to
serve
that
interest
if
it
was
extended
to
all
these
other
groups
that
we've
talked
about.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
except
for
the
fact
that
there
has
been
a
history
of
concern
about
the
problem
of
excluding
blacks
entirely
from
trials...
we
have
an
all-white
jury
trying
a
black
defendant.
we
haven't
had
the
same
kind
of
concern
about
women
complaining
about
all-male
jurors,
or...
the
problem
just
isn't
replicated
in
these
other
areas.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
think
we've
agreed
that
the
rule
of
batson
does
serve
our
interest
in
impartiality.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
you
limited
his
right
to
object
to
juries
which
appeared
by
reason
of
the
particular
exclusion,
appeared
to
be
partial?
in
other
words,
if
you
exclude
all
the
blacks,
and
you
end
up
with
a
white
jury,
one
could
argue
that
is
a
danger
that
looks
impartial.
but
these
other
examples
wouldn't
fit
that,
would
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
would
admit
a
racial
example
would
fit
it,
wouldn't
you,
that
sometimes
one
is
concerned
that
in
the
trial
of
a
black
by
an
all-white
jury,
there
is
a
concern
that
that
jury
may
not
look
impartial...
may
not
appear
to
the
public
to
be
impartial?
