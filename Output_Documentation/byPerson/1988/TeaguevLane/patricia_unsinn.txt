ms.
patricia
unsinn
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
tried
before
a
jury
from
which
all
black
representation
was
removed
by
use
of
the
peremptory
challenge.
although
11
of
the
32
jurors
who
withstood
challenges
for
cause
were
black,
the
prosecutor
exercised
all
10
of
the
peremptory
challenges
allotted
to
him
by
statute
to
remove
10
black
jurors
from
that
panel.
the
defense
exercised
one
of
its
challenges
against
the
remaining
black
juror...
she
was
married
to
a
police
officer,
and
his
client
was
charged
with
attempted
murder
of
a
police
officer.
the
result
was
that
the
petitioner
was
tried
before
a
jury
which
was
not
representative
of
the
community
which
was
25
percent
black.
this
case
thus
presents
the
question
of
whether
the
sixth
amendment
bars
the
prosecutor's
use
of
the
peremptory
challenge
to
defeat
the
possibility
that
the
petit
jury
will
be
representative
of
a
fair
cross
section
of
the
community.
ms.
patricia
unsinn
yes,
judge,
i
believe
you
would
because--
ms.
patricia
unsinn
--yes,
judge,
but--
ms.
patricia
unsinn
--no,
justice
o'connor,
we
don't
believe
that
we're
proposing
any
new
rule
in
our
sixth
amendment
argument.
we're
merely
asking
this
court
to
apply
its
precedents
to
a
different
factual
situation
than
it
has
previously
addressed.
ms.
patricia
unsinn
judge,
my
answer
remains
the
same.
we're
not
proposing
a
new
or
a
different
rule.
the
respondents...
this
court
is
taking
great
care
to
ensure
that
the
jury
pool
from
which
the
petit
jury
is
selected
is
representative
of
the
community.
it's
the
respondent's
position,
and
they
find
support
for
this
position
in
language
of
this
court
in
lockhart
v.
mccree,
that
extension
of
the
fair
cross
section
requirement
to
the
petit
jury
would
be
unworkable
and
unsound.
that
so
long
as
all
distinctive
groups
in
the
community
are
represented
on
the
jury
pool...
the
sixth
amendment
imposes
no
limitation
on
the
ability
of
the
prosecutor
to
remove
those
same
distinctive
groups
from
the
petit
jury.
we
suggest
that
accepting
this
argument
would
make
the
fair
cross
section
requirement
meaningless.
it
would
allow
the--
ms.
patricia
unsinn
--the
fair
cross
section
requirement?
ms.
patricia
unsinn
well,
judge,
as
i
said,
there
was
language
in
the
opinion
suggesting
that
this
was
correct.
ms.
patricia
unsinn
well,
judge,
it
was
certainly
a
conclusion--
ms.
patricia
unsinn
--pardon
me,
justice
rehnquist.
our
position
is
that
the
language
in
the
opinion
suggesting
that
the
sixth
amendment
doesn't
extend
to
the
petit
jury
was
unnecessary
to
the
result
reached
in
that
case,
and
thereby
doesn't
necessarily
bind
this
court
in
the
decision
in
this
case.
as
i
was
saying,
acceptance
of
that
argument
would
result
in
the
state
of
louisiana,
for
instance,
in
response
to
this
court's
decision
in
taylor,
rather
than
providing
that
women
would
be
excluded
from
the
jury
pool
by
use
of
a
statutory
exemption,
could
provide
that
women
are
entitled
to
be
included
in
the
jury
pool,
but
that
the
parties
can
exercise
challenges
for
cause
against
women,
once
they
are
represented
on
the
jury
pool,
on
the
assumption
that
their
family
responsibilities
would
cause
them
to
be
inattentive
jurors,
and
therefore
unfair.
this,
of
course,
i
think
would
be
an
absurd
result.
it
would
allow
the
prosecution
to
achieve
the
same
result
which
this
court
found
to
be
offensive
in
taylor.
the
fair
cross
section
requirement
has
no
meaning
or
purpose
unless
its
importance
is
recognized
to
extend
beyond
selection
of
the
jury
pool.
the
jury
pool
itself
is
not
a
deliberative
body.
it
is
the
petit
jury
which
provides
the
defendant
with
the
benefit
of
the
common
sense
judgement
of
the
community.
the
defendant
has
no
interest
in
a
jury
pool
which
is
representative
of
the
community
separate
from
the
impact
that
that
jury
pool,
the
representative
character
of
that
jury
pool
could
have
on
the
petit
jury
before
which
he
is
tried.
the
representative
jury
pool
is
not
an
end
in
itself.
it
merely
provides
the
means
and
the
possibility
that
the
petit
jury
will
be
similarly
representative
of
the
community.
the
exclusion
of
cognizable
groups
from
the
jury
pool
violates
the
sixth
amendment
only
because
it
serves
to
exclude
those
same
jurors
from
the
jury...
from
the
petit
jury.
we
are
not
asking
that
this
court
impose
any
requirement
that
the
petit
jury
be
of
any
particular
composition.
we
are
not
asking
that
any
quotas
be
imposed,
we're
not
asking
that
any
affirmative
action
be
taken
to
achieve
a
certain
result.
all
we're
saying
is
that
the
statistical
impossibility
that
each
and
every
petit
jury
will
mirror
the
community
should
not
excuse
a
deliberate
perversion
of
the
process
to
achieve
an
unrepresentative
jury.
ms.
patricia
unsinn
judge...
justice
o'connor,
it's
our
position
that
there's
nothing
inconsistent
with
our
argument
and
the
achievement
of
a
fair
and
impartial
jury.
our
argument
is
that
disallowing
peremptory
challenges
to
allow
the
petit
jury
the
possibility
of
being
representative
in
fact
furthers
the
goal
of
a
fair
and
impartial
jury.
the
prosecutor
would
not
be
disallowed
from
using
his
peremptory
challenges
to
exclude
members
of
a
group
if
he
has
a
reasoned
basis
to
question
the
bias
of
the
jury,
of
the
juror.
the
only
thing
that
he's
going
to
be
prevented
from
doing...
and
he's
not
going
to
be
required
to
accept
jurors
merely
because
they're
members
of
a
certain
group.
all
that
he's
going
to
be
prevented
from
doing
is
making
assumptions
about
the
partiality
of
the
juror
based
on
their
group
identity.
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
facts
of
this
case,
it
well
demonstrates
our
argument.
the
trial
prosecutors
never
contended--
ms.
patricia
unsinn
--it
may
be
done
all
the
time.
our
position,
though,
is
whether
or
not
that
is
done
consistently
with
the
sixth
amendment.
i
think
there's
a
difference
between
excusing
the
woman
juror
in
this
instance
because
of
fear
that
her
close
relationship
with
a
police
officer
is
going
to
cause
her
to
be
sympathetic
with
the
victims
in
this
case
than
making
the
assumption
merely
on
the
basis
of
one's
group
identity
that
they
cannot
be
fair.
ms.
patricia
unsinn
no,
judge,
our
position...
although
this
case
doesn't
present
that
question...
we
would
be
willing
to
concede
that
any
rule
that
this
court
would
adopt
should
apply
equally
to
the
defense
as
well
as
the
prosecution.
certainly
the
defense
would
not
be
prevented
from
excusing
white
jurors
if
it
had
some
basis,
some
individual
basis
to
question
the--
ms.
patricia
unsinn
--no.
but
that
doesn't...
that
would
not
be
consistent
with
our
argument,
no.
the
prosecutors
in
this
case
had
no
basis,
and
articulated
no
basis
on
which
they
questioned
the
bias
of
the
black
jurors
who
were
excluded.
ms.
patricia
unsinn
under
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
my
client
would
succeed
under
either
an
equal
protection
analysis--
ms.
patricia
unsinn
--yes,
that's
correct.
ms.
patricia
unsinn
the
equal
protection
clause.
ms.
patricia
unsinn
batson
itself
involved
a
black
defendant.
ms.
patricia
unsinn
i
don't
know
that
there
were
any--
ms.
patricia
unsinn
--yes.
there
would
be--
ms.
patricia
unsinn
--this
is
correct.
ms.
patricia
unsinn
in
some
respects
it
would.
there
would
be...
under
the
equal
protection
analysis,
the
defendant
has
to
be
a
member
of
the
excluded
group,
in
order
to
have
standing
to
raise
a
claim
of
discrimination.
under
the
sixth
amendment,
the
defendant
who
has
a--
ms.
patricia
unsinn
--perhaps
a
woman--
ms.
patricia
unsinn
--a
woman
defendant
who
complains
about
exclusion
of
women
jurors.
ms.
patricia
unsinn
on
an
equal
protection
basis.
ms.
patricia
unsinn
judge,
i
don't
know.
ms.
patricia
unsinn
pardon
me,
justice?
ms.
patricia
unsinn
to
every
distinctive
group
in
the
community?
well,
the
only
groups
that
this
court
has
to
date
recognized
as
being
distinctive
groups
in
the
community
are
blacks,
women,
and
mexican-americans.
ms.
patricia
unsinn
i
am
not
aware
of
any
widespread
recognition
of
other
groups,
and
i
think
that
as
i--
ms.
patricia
unsinn
--as
the
opinion
in
taylor
makes
clear--
ms.
patricia
unsinn
--there
is
that
language
in
lockhart
v.
mccree,
although
unnecessary
to
the
result
reached
there,
it
suggests
that
the
court
would
be
unwilling
to
do
so.
ms.
patricia
unsinn
we're
asking
for
the
possibility
that
the
jury
be
representative,
yes.
ms.
patricia
unsinn
the
test
that
we've
proposed
would
require
that
the
ultimate
composition
of
the
jury
be
unrepresentative
of
the
community,
so
i
don't
know
that
after--
ms.
patricia
unsinn
--in
many
instances,
i
believe
that
would
be
so.
there
may
be
some
instances--
ms.
patricia
unsinn
--i
think
that
that's
an
open
question.
in
batson,
this
court
stated
that
it
expressed
no
opinion
whether
the
remedy
would
be
to
disallow
the
use
of
the
peremptory
challenges,
or
to
require
that
a
new
jury
be
selected.
i
imagine
this
court
could
take
the
same
position
with
respect
to
this
issue.
ms.
patricia
unsinn
no
more
so
than
i
think
he
would
be
able
to
do
in
the
batson
case.
ms.
patricia
unsinn
no,
we're
not
saying
that
he
needs
cause.
we're
saying
that
if,
in
fact,
the
defendant
were
able
to
sustain
this
burden
of
proving
that
the
prosecutor's
use
of
the
peremptory
challenge
has
resulted
in
an
unrepresentative
jury,
then
the
prosecutor
would
have
to
justify
that
by
showing
existence
of
a
significant
state
interest
which
would--
ms.
patricia
unsinn
--i
would
imagine
whenever
it
became
evident
that
the
representative
nature
of,
character
of
the
jury
was
being
impaired.
ms.
patricia
unsinn
whenever
the...
i
would
imagine
it
would
be
in
the
later
stages
of
jury
selection,
when
the
parties
are--
ms.
patricia
unsinn
--i
think
the
example
of
two
or
three
weeks
is
probably
an
extreme
situation
and
is
not
the
case
in
the
majority
of
situations.
certainly
the
batson
remedy
would
require
the
same
kind,
you
know,
of
loss
of
time.
you
know,
the
question
is,
which
is
the
more
important
interest?
not...
and
also,
the
question
is,
to
whom
is
that
loss
of
time
attributable
to?
it's
certainly
not
attributable
to
the
defendant,
who's
trying
to
exercise,
to
vindicate
his
right
under
the
sixth
amendment.
it's
attributable
to
the
prosecutor,
who
is
the
person
who's
violated
the
dictates
of--
ms.
patricia
unsinn
--judge,
i--
ms.
patricia
unsinn
--no,
i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
that
he
could
look...
this
court
could
look
to
language
that
suggests
that
there
must
be
a
balancing
of
the
scales
between
the
defendant
and
the
state.
ms.
patricia
unsinn
no.
ms.
patricia
unsinn
no,
but
the
court
could
allow
the
state
to
exercise--
ms.
patricia
unsinn
--this
court,
or
a
state
court.
ms.
patricia
unsinn
then
state
courts
could
allow
prosecutors
to
question
the
basis
on
which
the
defense
counsel
are
making
use
of
their
challenges.
i
also
think
perhaps
we're
overstating
some
of
the
problems
that
this
rule
might
entail.
every
possible
group
that
exists
in
the
community
is
not
necessarily
going
to
be
a
distinctive
group
in
the
community.
as
i
said
earlier,
there
are
only
three
groups
that
this
court
has
recognized
to
be
distinctive
groups
in
the
community
for
fair
cross
section
purposes.
i
don't
know
that
the
conclusion
would
necessarily
be
drawn
that
because
a
juror
is
in
a
certain
income
bracket,
and
another
juror
is
in
another
income
bracket
that
those
jurors
are
separate
and
distinct
groups
in
the
community
such
that
the
prosecutor
would
be
prevented
from
excluding
any
one
of
them.
ms.
patricia
unsinn
justice,
that
would
depend
upon
whether
or
not
the
defendant
was
able
to
persuade
the
trial
judge
that
an
age
group
would
be
a
distinctive
group
in
the
community.
i
don't
know
that
these
questions
can
be
resolved
in
this
case.
they're
not
really
presented,
and
they're
probably
better
decided
in
cases
which
really
have
fully
developed
the
record
as
to
why
an
age
group
should
be
a
distinctive--
ms.
patricia
unsinn
--yes.
ms.
patricia
unsinn
we
don't.
ms.
patricia
unsinn
i'm
just
trying
to
remind
the
court
that
this...
adoption
of
this
rule
isn't
going
to
lead
to
some
horrendous
consequence.
i
agree
that
it's
only
necessary
for
this
court
to
recognize,
as
it
has
already
done,
that
blacks
are
a
representative
group
in
the
community,
a
distinctive
group
in
the
community,
such
that
a
prosecutor
shouldn't
be
allowed
to
interfere
with
the
possibility
that
those
jurors
can
sit
on
the
jury.
as
i
was
saying,
the
prosecutors
in
this
case
never
questioned
the
partiality
of
the
black
jurors.
the
explanation
that
they
gave
was
that
they
were
attempting
to
achieve
a
balance
of
men
and
women
and
age
groups.
the
court
of
appeals'
panel
opinion
found
that
that
explanation
was
pretextual.
the
respondents
have
never
questioned
the
validity
of
that
panel
opinion
judgement.
ms.
patricia
unsinn
no,
justice
white,
i
have
not.
i've--
ms.
patricia
unsinn
--well,
i
think
this
case
itself
demonstrates
when
a
defendant
would
attempt
to
make
the
complaint.
the
complaint
here
was
made--
ms.
patricia
unsinn
--no,
i'm
speaking
about
when
the
complaint
was
made
in
the
trial
court.
i
think
it
was
probably
a
little...
halfway
through
voir
dire
of
the
jurors,
of
the
32
jurors.
so
certainly
there
was
substantial
proceedings
that
occurred
before
a
complaint
was
made.
based
on
my
experience
in
pre-batson
cases,
it
was
not
unusual
for
a
defense
counselor
to
make
the
complaint
towards
the
later
stages
of
jury
selection,
when
it
became
apparent
that
there
was
a
discriminatory
inference
to
be
concluded
from
the
manner
in
which
the
prosecutor
was
exercising
its
challenges.
certainly
under
batson
this
court
recognizes
that
disproportionate
exclusion
is
one
of
the
kinds
of
evidence
that
can
be
looked
to
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
prosecutor
is
discriminating,
and
certainly
that
is
not
going
to
be
apparent
until
the
later
stages
of
jury
selection.
unless
there
are
any
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
ms.
patricia
unsinn
thank
you.
the
respondents
contend
that
we
have
made
no
complaint
that
the
jury
before
which
petitioner
was
tried
was
not
an
impartial
jury.
that
is
precisely
what
our
complaint
is.
our
complaint
is
that
because
the
prosecutor
took
affirmative
action
to
destroy
the
representative
character
of
that
jury,
that
we
did
not
in
fact
get
the
kind
of
fair
and
impartial
jury
that
the
sixth
amendment
guarantees.
the
respondent--
ms.
patricia
unsinn
--no,
justice
white,
that
has
never
been
our
position.
ms.
patricia
unsinn
no,
i
think
there's
a
distinction--
ms.
patricia
unsinn
--no,
our
position
is
that
we're
entitled
to
the
possibility
of
a
fair
cross
section
on
our
jury,
and
that's
the
reason
that
the
sixth
amendment
requires
that
all
distinctive
groups
in
the
community
be
included
on
the
jury
pool.
our
position
is
that
there's
a
fair
cross
section
violation
only
when
there
is
some
interference
with--
ms.
patricia
unsinn
--with
the
law
of
chance,
which
is
not
directly
related
to
the
ability
of
the
individual
jurors
to
be
fair
and
impartial.
ms.
patricia
unsinn
that
is
correct.
that
is
our--
ms.
patricia
unsinn
--it
provides
the
possibility
of
a
cross
sectional
jury
whenever
it
includes
all
distinctive
groups
in
the
community
in
the
pool.
it's
obviously
statistically
impossible
for
every
single
jury
that's
selected
in
a
community
to
accurately
mirror
that
community
in
every
respect.

--no,
i
don't
agree
with
that.
all
we're
saying
is
that
the
jury
as
an
institution
serves
the
purpose
that
it
was
intended
to
serve,
so
long
as
the
state
provides
the
possibility
of
a
representational
jury,
and
only
if
there's
some
affirmative
interference
with
that
possibility
is
the
sixth
amendment
violated.
if
there's
no
affirmative
interference,
then
the
defendant's
been
given
the
kind
of
fair
and
impartial
jury
that
he's
entitled
to.
there's
been
no
interference,
there's
been
no
violation
of
the
democratic
ideal.
every
juror
has
equal
opportunity
to
participate
in
the
jury.
there's
no...
public
confidence
in
the
jury
is
maintained.
every...
there
has
been
no
spectacle
witnessed
by
the
public
of
an
intentional
intrusion
into
the
representative
character
of
the
jury,
and
there
has
been
no
action
taken
to
dilute
the
quality
of
community
judgement
that's
represented
by
the
jury.
the
defendant's
been
given
the
benefit
of
the
possibility
that
his
jury
will
be
representative.
the
respondents
say
that
if
they
are
not
allowed
to
use
their
peremptory
challenges
to
produce
a
fair
jury,
that
they
will
be
denied
the
use
of
peremptory
challenges,
for
instance,
in
those
instances
where
a
juror
admits
to
bias
but
then
says
"i
can
be
fair
and
impartial.
"
and
thereby
withstands
a
challenge
for
cause.
our
argument
concedes
that
if
the
prosecutor
has
that
kind
of
reasoned
basis
to
question
the
partiality
of
the
jury,
then
the
sixth
amendment
would
not
interfere
with
his
ability
to
peremptorily
challenge
that
jury.
it's
only
when
he's
making
group-based
assumptions
about
jurors'
partiality
that
sixth
amendment
violation
occurs.
