chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
evidence
next
in
number
87-5259,
frank
dean
teague
against
michael
lane.
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready,
ms.
unsinn.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
accepted
in
lockhart
v.
mccree,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
extended
to
a
petit
jury?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
think
that
that
does
not
mean
that
that
was
accepted,
if
it
was
simply
language
in
the
opinion,
as
you
refer
to
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
i'm
the
chief
justice,
i'm
not
a
judge.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
at
what
point
during
the
trial,
ms.
unsinn,
does
that
happen?
you
say
the
defendant
has
to
make
some
sort
of
a
showing.
at
what
point
in
the
trial
does
that
kind
of
thing
happen?
this
is
perhaps
the
follow
up
of
justice
kennedy's
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
how
would
one
know
when
that
had
happened?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
even
if
a
defendant
doesn't
persuade
the
trial
judge,
if
he
persuades
the
appellate
court,
he
gets
the
same
result,
doesn't
he?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
unsinn.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
bindi.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bindi.
ms.
unsinn,
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
unsinn.
the
case
is
submitted.
