justice
byron
r.
white
well,
batson...
what
did
it
rest
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it's
a
racial
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
argument
would
go
beyond
batson
because
it
would
apply
to
any
distinctive
group
in
the
community.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
furthermore,
there
are
some
people
who
say
that
batson
only
applies
in
favor
of
the
member
of
the
group
excluded.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
rule,
if
established,
has
a
considerably
broader
impact
than
batson?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think...
who
do
you
think
could
win
on
an
equal
protection
basis,
other
than
racial
claimants?
justice
byron
r.
white
religious?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
an
equal
protection
basis?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
batson
would
not
automatically
apply
to
them,
i
don't
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
batson
wouldn't
automatically
apply
to
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
that
anybody
exercising
a
peremptory
challenge
is
doing
so
at
his
peril
unless
he
gives
a
reason
for
it,
and
would
say
i
don't
know
whether
this
person
is
a
member
of
a
representative
or
a
distinctive
group
or
not,
but
if
he
or
she
is,
here's
why
i'm
throwing
her
or
him
off.
and
then
the
judge
said,
"well,
that
isn't
good
enough.
"
so
he
has
to
leave
him
on,
i
guess?
in
other
words,
you
need
cause
for
peremptory
challenges.
peremptory
challenges
for
cause
would
be
the
only
kind
that
would
stand.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
only
takes
two
or
three
weeks,
or
maybe
a
couple
of
months
to
get
12
jurors
seated
now
in
the
state
courts,
sometimes.
if
you
have
to
start
over,
it
would
be
very
interesting.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
rule
of
law
would
a
prosecutor
invoke
if
he
wanted
to
challenge
the
peremptories
exercised
by
a
defendant?
justice
byron
r.
white
bad
cross
section?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
a
federal,
constitutional
requirement?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
you're
saying
there
would
be
no
federal
constitutional
basis
for
the
prosecutor
making,
challenging
peremptories
of
a
defendant.
justice
byron
r.
white
which?
this
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
can't
do
anything
except
to
a
state
court,
except
based
on
the
constitution.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
age
groups?
justice
byron
r.
white
have
you
been
involved
in
the
criminal
trials
that
have
occurred
since
batson?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
was
just
wondering
how
the
batson
rule
is
working
out
in
practice
then.
how
do
they...
when
are
questions
raised,
and
when
does
the
defendant
attempt
to
prove
the
peremptories
have
been
discriminatorily
exercised?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
federal
habeas
corpus.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
say
that
in
a
post-batson
trial
a
defendant
challenges
a
prosecutor's
use
of
his
peremptories,
and
the
judge
asks
the
prosecutor
to
justify
striking
all
these
women,
or
all
these
blacks,
and
the
prosecutor
says
well,
i
just
don't
think
any
black
or
any
woman
sitting
in
this
case
can
be
an
impartial
juror.
would
that
be
a
decent
response?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
that
in
a
fair
cross
section
case,
the
prosecutor
should
have
complete
freedom
to
exercise
those
sort
of
stereotypical
views
by
striking
all
members
of
a
particular
group?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
batson's
got
nothing
to
do
with
the
rights
of
a
defendant
or
just
with
potential
jurors?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about...
i
just
wanted
to
avoid
all
this
wrangling
about
fair
cross
section,
and
batson.
and
i
just
said,
the
only
challenges
that
are
going
to
occur
in
criminal
trials
are
challenges
for
cause.
that
would
be
constitutional,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
a
state
could
just
do
away
with
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
appearance
or
actuality?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that...
you
say
that
it
really
wouldn't
affect
the
impartiality
of
a
jury
if
peremptories
were
eliminated.
at
least
there
would
be
no
constitutional
basis
for
questioning
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
carried
to
its
logical
conclusion,
even
if
there
were
no
peremptories
exercised
by
either
side,
if
the
jury
that
was
drawn
from
a
representative
panel
just
happened
to
exclude
a
distinctive
group
in
the
community,
it
should
be
reconstituted.
justice
byron
r.
white
one
last
question.
if
it
just
so
happens
that
the
jury,
the
petit
jury
that's
drawn
doesn't
include
a
negro,
although
there
are
negroes
on
the
[inaudible],
the
defendant
just
isn't
getting
the
kind
of
fair
trial
that
the
sixth
amendment
requires?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
just
said
it
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
don't
get
a
fair
cross
section,
you
don't
have
the
kind
of
a
fair
and
impartial
jury.
that's
what
i
thought
you
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
with
the
law
of
chance?
