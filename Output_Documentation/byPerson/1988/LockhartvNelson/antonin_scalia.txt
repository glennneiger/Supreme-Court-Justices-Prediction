justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
saying
it
was
trial
error.
you're
actually
saying
it
was
new
evidence.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
it
a
little
confusing,
general
clark,
to
talk
about
this
as
an
admissibility
problem?
i
suppose
all
evidence
that
is
effectively
rebutted
can
be
said
to
have
been
inadmissible
because
it's
not
probative.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
we're
getting
led
off
the
track
by
talking
about
it
as
an
admissibility
case.
this
stuff
was
clearly
admissible.
i
don't
think
there
was
any
trial
error
in
admitting
it.
why
was
there
any
trial
error?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
other
evidence
should
have
been
brought
forward.
that's
all.
but
just
because
i
let
in
one
person's
testimony
and
i
don't
let
in
the
testimony...
and
the
other
side
doesn't
bring
forward
someone
who
could
have
totally
refuted
that
rendering
it
irrelevant
and,
therefore,
inadmissible,
i
haven't
been
guilty
of
making
a
trial
error
by
admitting
it
in
the
first
place,
have
i?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
no
probative
value
only
after
it
was
refuted
by
the
pardon.
but
when
it
was
presented,
it
had
probative
value.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
as
when
you
present
a
witness--
justice
antonin
scalia
--who
later
may
be
utterly
destroyed
by
another
witness,
that
witness
is
properly
admissible--
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
say
it's
a
void
in
their
proof?
in
fact,
if
you
viewed
this
when
that
trial
was
over,
you
would
say
they
proved
their
case?
it's
your
side
that
had
the
void,
you
had
a
void
in
your
defense.
but
as
far
as
what
was
before
the
court,
after
the
trial
you'd
look
at
it
and
you'd
say,
"sure
enough
there's
four
convictions".
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
a
murder
trial
in
which
there
is
some
dispute
as
to
whether
the
alleged
decedent
was
even
killed
and
they
produced
testimony
about
a
certain
corpse
and
it
is
later
found
out
that
it
was
not
the
right
corpse?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
another
person
was
killed.
justice
antonin
scalia
therefore,
that
testimony
at
the
first
trial
should
not
have
been
admitted,
because
the
fellow
was
testifying
about
a
different
corpse.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
another
victim.
there's
still
only
one
person
who
was
charged.
he
was
only
charged
with
killing
one
individual.
i
don't
see
why
that's
any
different
from
your
case.
it
turns
out
that
evidence
admitted
before,
in
the
light
of
subsequently
discovered
evidence,
was
not
relevant.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
i'm
saying
it's
still
not
sure
that
person
a
was
even
killed
because
the
testimony
introduced
in
trial
one
by
a
coroner,
the
coroner
later
discovers
that,
oh,
he
was
totally
mistaken,
it
wasn't
corpse
a,
it
was
somebody
else.
would
you
say
that
you
couldn't
retry
the
person
because
there
was
not
evidence
to
convict?
at
the
time
of
the
trial
there
was
enough
evidence
to
convict.
you
had
a
coroner
who
said
a
was
killed,
"i
saw
his
body".
