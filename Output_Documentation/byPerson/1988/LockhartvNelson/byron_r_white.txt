justice
byron
r.
white
--i
take
it...
just
to
pursue
this
point
one
question
further...
that
if
under
your
analogy
a
blood
sample
in
a
drunk
driving
case
is
introduced
and
it's
from
the
wrong
person,
that's
sufficient
evidence?
there
is
error,
we
find
out--
justice
byron
r.
white
--it's
not
authenticated
properly,
the
judge
admits
it
erroneously,
we
find
out
that
it's
the
wrong
blood
sample...
in
your
view,
that's
sufficient
evidence--
justice
byron
r.
white
--to
justify
retrial?
