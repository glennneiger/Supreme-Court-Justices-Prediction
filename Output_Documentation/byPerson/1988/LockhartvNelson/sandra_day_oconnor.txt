justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
fact
here,
i
think
that
decision
was
to
be
made
by
the
judge,
but
under
a
mistake
he
referred
it
to
the
jury.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
general
clark,
i
know
you're
arguing
the
burks
question.
i'm
just
wondering,
are
you
convinced
that
bullington
necessarily
applies--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--outside
the
capital
context?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
just
wonder
why
you
were
so
willing
to
concede
that.
it
strikes
me
as
very
curious.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--general
clark,
do
you
think
the
case
of
poland
against
arizona
from
this
court
has
any
bearing
on
this
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
should
have
been
tried
to
the
judge,
i
guess.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
isn't
all
that
clear
to
me,
frankly,
that
the
bullington
line
of
cases
should
even
apply
outside
the
capital
context.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
guess
there
is
another
statute
in
arkansas
that
lets
you
sentence
as
an
habitual
offender
someone
with
just
one
prior
conviction.
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
think
the
state
can't
even
go
after
him
again
under
the
lesser
enhancement
statute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what's
the
matter
with
the
other
habitual
offender
provision?
