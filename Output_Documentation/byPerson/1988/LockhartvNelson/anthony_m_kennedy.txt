justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
counsel,
what's
the
standard
here?
we're
assuming
that
to
determine
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
that
the
improperly
admitted
evidence
was
considered.
isn't
that
the
test?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
we
then
look
at
that
evidence
and
see
whether
or
not
it
could
support
a
conviction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
can't
support
a
conviction
if
it's
not
a
pardon.
suppose
these
had
been
pardons
of
someone
else
with
a
similar
name?
sufficiency
of
the
evidence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
if
they
were
the
convictions
of
someone
else?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
have
any
problem
here
because
you're
proceeding
on
habeas
corpus?
the
state
appellate
court
has
never
set
aside
this
conviction.
your
client
has
been
in
jeopardy
the
entire
course
of
the
proceedings
until
habeas
comes.
and
haven't
we
limited
burks
in
the
habeas
situation?
