mr.
j.
steven
clark
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
state
of
arkansas
believes
the
facts
in
this
case
are
somewhat
simple
in
that
simply
what
occurred
here
in
our
trial
courts
in
union
county
was
trial
error
rather
than
a
failure
to
submit
sufficient
evidence.
in
1980
the
defendant,
johnny
lee
nelson,
was
charged
with
burglary,
breaking
and
entering,
and
misdemeanor
theft.
in
1982
he
pled
guilty
to
that
same
charge
and
agreed
to
be
sentenced
by
a
jury.
because
of
the
defendant's
previous
prior
convictions
my
state
chose
to
sentence
him
as
an
habitual
offender.
the
state
introduced
four
prior
convictions,
one
of
which
included
a
conviction
of
assault
with
intent
to
rape.
the
jury,
after
hearing
the
evidence,
sentenced
the
defendant
to
20
years
as
an
habitual
offender,
the
minimum
sentence
under
our
statute.
the
sentence
was
subsequently
upheld
by
the
arkansas
court
of
appeals
and
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
arkansas.
in
1985
mr.
nelson
filed
a
habeas
petition
alleging
that
one
of
the
four
convictions
upon
which
the
state
relied
had
been
pardoned.
the
united
states
district
court
asked
my
office
to
in
fact
investigate
that
fact
and
we
did,
and
learned
that
there
had
been
a
pardon
on
the
conviction
of
assault
with
intent
to
rape.
the
district
court
then
issued
an
opinion
which
held
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
applied
to
the
state
of
arkansas
and
would
bar
us
from
resentencing
mr.
nelson
as
an
habitual
offender.
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
that
decision.
in
that
order
from
the
district
court
and
from
the
eighth
circuit
the
state
of
arkansas
was
advised
that
in
fact
we
either
had
to
retry
mr.
nelson
as
a
burglar,
sentencing
him
to
three
to
twenty
years,
or
to
let
him
go
within
60
days.
the
state
concedes
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
applies
to
the
sentencing
phase
of
our
trial
procedure
in
the
instance
that
that
procedure
is
one
in
which
the
state
has
a
burden
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
one
in
which
the
state
may
offer
witnesses
and
the
defendant
has
an
opportunity
to
confront
those
and
cross-examine
and
offer
other
testimony.
and
so
in
that
instance
bullington
standard,
as
articulated
by
this
court,
we
submit
and
concede
applies
to
that
procedure.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor.
under
our
state
statute
if
you
are
sentenced
as
an
habitual
offender,
you
must
give
the
defendant
notice
of
that
but
not
notice
of
the
prior
conviction
upon
which
the
state
will
rely.
so,
mr.
nelson
knew
that
we
were
going
to
sentence
his,
or
attempt
to
sentence
him,
as
an
habitual
offender.
yet,
i
further
submit
and
contend
that
the
district
court
in
its
decision
found
this
case
to
be
like
that
of
a
burks
decision
of
this
court
when
in
fact
this
case
can
be
distinguished
from
a
burks
decision.
this
is
not
a
decision
like
burks
in
which
there
is
an
insufficiency
of
the
evidence.
this
is
a
case
in
which
we
had
trial
error
that
occurred.
that
distinction
is
really
based
on
this
analogy,
i
would
offer
to
this
court.
the
burden
pushed
upon
the
state
of
arkansas
was
to
fill
a
basket,
a
basket
full
of
apples.
that
was
four
prior
convictions
to
trigger
the
habitual
offender
act
in
order
to
let
the
jury
consider
the
evidence
and
determine
if
in
fact
the
state
had
made
its
burden
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
we
attempted
to
do
just
that
and
believed
that
we
had.
we
did
that
in
the
instance
offering
four
prior
felony
convictions
from
the
court
records.
these
were
certified
copies
of
commitment
orders
from
the
union
county
circuit
court.
when
we
offered
those--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--yes,
your
honor,
one
can
argue
that,
clearly.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor,
one
could
argue
that
clearly.
i
think
the
distinction
to
be
drawn
in
this
case
is
this.
it
is
that
at
the
time
that
we
offered
those
four
prior
convictions,
as
you
will
recall
from
the
record,
there
was
no
objection,
you
recall
there
was
some
discussion.
the
defendant
himself
made
some
reference
to
the
fact
that
he
believed
he
had
been
pardoned.
yet,
he
also
made
some
comment
to
the
fact
that
he
believed
his
sentence
had
been
commuted
to
a
term
of
years.
i
submit
to
this
court
that
the
better
reason
rule
of
law
is
two
here
in
this
instance
and
distinguishes
this
from
burks.
one,
that
the
state,
i
believe,
should
have
the
right
to
rely
upon
the
trial
judge.
the
trial
judge,
after
hearing
the
statements
of
the
defendant
and
looking
at
the
evidence
as
offered
as
being
competent
to
represent
the
facts
for
which
it
was
offered,
let
it
be
admitted.
secondly,
in
our
process
which
is
a
bifurcated
process,
the
jury
had
the
opportunity
to
consider
that
evidence
as
it
was
introduced,
as
to
its
competency.
the
jury
had--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
the
arkansas
legislature
had
amended
our
law
in
1981.
this
trial
proceeding
occurred
in
1982.
the
trial
judge
did
make
error.
he
gave
the
four
convictions
to
the
jury
for
the
purpose
of
them
determining
their
validity
as
competent
evidence.
but
the
jury,
as
i
suggested,
made
a
decision
which
distinguished
this
case
from
burks
in
the
instance
that
they
heard
the
evidence;
the
statement
of
the
defendant,
the
comments
of
prosecutor,
the
comments
of
the
trial
judge,
and
the
statement
of
the
defendant
that
in
fact
his
sentence
had
been
commuted
to
a
term
of
years,
and
comments
by
his
defense
counsel.
weighing
all
of
that,
the
jury
determined
these
were
four
competent
convictions
upon
which
they
could
believe
or
accept...
and
in
this
instance
did
believe
and
accept...
and
weighed
them
to
believe
that
the
state
had
met
its
burden
of
proof.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor.
we're
willing
to
concede
that
in
this
case
it
does
because
we
think
the
very
nature
of
our
trial
process
for
habitual
offenders
is
much
like
that...
or
is
identical,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
to
a
capital
case
where
we
bifurcate.
and
we
really
present
that
sentencing
phase
very
much
like
a
trial
phase.
so,
we
have--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--your
honor,
i'm
only
willing
to
concede
that
because
i
simply
believe
that
that
is
the
way
that
process
occurs
and
would
not
want
to
misrepresent
or
mislead
this
court
in
any
fashion.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
no,
your
honor,
we
did
not.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
we
did
offer--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--yes,
your
honor,
we
did
present
the
conviction.
we
did
not
deliberately
present
it
knowing
it
had
been
pardoned.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
your
honor,
at
the
time
that
we
offered--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--yes,
your
honor,
we
did.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
no,
your
honor,
it
was
not.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
no,
your
honor.
i
submit--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--your
honor,
in
the
interest
of
the
time
that
we
offered
this
conviction,
which
was
a
1960
conviction
which
followed
the
1964
pardon,
the
time
that
the
notice
came
to
the
state,
other
than
the
comments
of
the
defendant...
and
the
comments
of
the
defendant
were
weighted
both
by
the
trial
court
and
by
the
jury--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--did
the
prosecutor
support
the
evidence?
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
we
did,
your
honor.
we--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--it
was
erroneous
at
the
time.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
we
thought--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--your
honor,
we
believed
that
the
conviction
was
a
valid
conviction
at
the
time
that
it
was
offered.
on
the
face
of
the
court
records
it
said
it
was.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
your
honor,
the
conviction
continues
to
exist
today
regardless
of
what
maybe
was
said
in
respondent's
brief
in
terms
of--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--our
court
said
it
was,
your
honor,
after
a--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--you
should
listen
to
our
court
in
the
sense,
your
honor,
when
the
collateral
attack
came
and
the
habeas
petition
and
the
facts
were
discovered
by
the
trial
court
of
the
state,
which
we
admitted,
and
the
defense,
that
in
fact
we
had
offered
an
erroneous
conviction
not
known
to
any
of
the
persons
at
that
trial
proceeding
in
1982,
then
we
at
that
point
said--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--said
error
occurred.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
we
did
not
know,
your
honor,
at
the
time
offered.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
no,
your
honor,
my
office
was
not.
my
office
is
not
routinely--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--your
honor,
that's
correct.
that
is
correct
procedure
today
and
that
would
have
been
a
correct
procedure
in
1964.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
it's
not
in
that
record,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
instance
that
the
procedure
in
arkansas
is
such
that
the
governor's
office
does
not
give
me
regular
notice
of
the
fact
that
a
pardon
has
been
issued.
in
this
instance,
in
the
facts,
as
you
recall,
the
pardon
was
issued
in
1964
by
governor
faubus.
it
was
some
22
years
later
that
mr.
nelson
was
placed
on
trial
and
tried
as
an
habitual
offender
and
it
was
some
six
years
after
that...
or
five
years
after
that
that
in
fact
the
collateral
attack
occurred.
what
i
submit
to
this
court
occurred
in
this
instance
was
that
the
trial
court
had
a
responsibility
to
make
a
decision.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
absolutely
none,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor,
there
was.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
yes,
sir.
that
is
exactly
the
colloquy
that
occurred
in
that
courtroom.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
it
was
not
true.
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
at
the
time,
however,
the
jury
had
the
opportunity
to
hear
all
that
colloquy
that
occurred
and
to
weigh
that
evidence
and
to
make
a
determination
once
it
was
ruled
to
be
admissible
had
arkansas
met
its
burden
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
for
the
purpose
of
enhancing
as
an
habitual
offender.
and
they
concluded
just
that.
when
we
came
back--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
rule
that
the
state
of
arkansas
is
articulating
we
believe
this
court
should
adopt
is
this.
that
on
appellate
review
you
look
at
the
record
within
the
four
corners
of
the
record,
the
appellant
reviewing
body
then
ask
the
question
of
sufficiency
within
light
of
all
evidence
admitted,
whether
objected
to
or
not.
if
you
found
that
we
filled
that
barrel
of
apples,
we
rose
to
the
level
of
sufficiency
of
evidence,
which
i
submit
we
did,
we
submitted
four
prior
convictions--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--even
if...
then
if
you
find
there
was
trial
error
that
occurred,
the
convictions
of
someone
else,
another
johnny
lee
nelson,
the
wrong
mr.
nelson,
but
it
was
believed
it
was
the
correct
mr.
nelson,
the
trial
judge
it
accepted
as
admissible,
the
jury
weighted
it
and
considered
it
as
admissible
even
though
there
was
some
colloquy
or
objection
or
any
other
evidence
in
the
record,
that
at
that
point
the
proper
decision
then
is
to
consider
this
as
trial
error
because
we
met
our
sufficiency
standard
first.
and
then
we
get
a
chance
to
come
back
and
try
this
case
again.
otherwise,
to
remove
that
evidence,
saying,
as
justice
stevens
said,
we
had
an
orange
instead
of
an
apple,
and
the
appellant
court
says,
"excuse
me,
you
had
there
four
apples;
you've
got
three
and
an
orange,
you're
insufficient
evidence.
"
is
that
you
put
a
burden
on
my
state
in
this
instance
of
a
situation
where
we
literally
are
arguably
overtrying
our
cases,
but
in
terms
of
every
objection,
we
don't
know
at
some
point
when
we're
going
to
be
barred
from
coming
back
from
a
fifth
amendment
double
jeopardy
argument
from
trying
a
case
where
mere
trial
error
had
occurred.
and
we
don't
have
perfect
trials
in
arkansas.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
i
think,
your
honor,
that
you
have
articulated
the
one
instance
where
i
think
the
sufficiency
would
not
have
been
met
by
the
state.
i
think
this
court
has
said
repeatedly
that
in
terms
of
the
appellate
court's
proper
authority
they
can
review
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
and
if
they
could
conclude
that
a
reasonable
jury
could
not
have
reached
the
decision
that
we
had
four
apples
because
one
of
them
had
pardon
right
across
the
front
with
whistles
and
bells
and
bows
and
buttons,
and
whatever,
then
in
fact
this
court
could
reverse
and
say
the
state
failed
to
meet
its
sufficiency
standard.
but
that
didn't
occur
in
my
case.
mine
is
a
different
case.
we
had
four
convictions
that
on
their
face,
showing
legitimate
court
orders,
said
convicted
of
these
crimes.
all
we
had
was
the
colloquy
among
the
parties
present
as
to
what
really
in
fact
occurred,
and
the
defendant
himself
said
it
was
commuted
to
a
term
of
years.
the
jury,
hearing
all
of
this,
weighed
it,
knowing
that
the
burden,
as
instructed
to
them
by
the
trial
judge,
was
on
us
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
we
did
that.
add
a
collateral
attack
subsequently
later,
we
learned,
my
office
learned,
that
in
fact
there
had
been
a
pardon.
at
that
point
we
believed
that
the
proper
rule
of
law
is
to
let
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
weigh
that
basket
and
see
if
it's
full,
and
if
it
is--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--yes,
your
honor.
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
under
extraordinary
relief
which
we
call
rule
37
petitions
to
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas.
this
issue
of
the
pardon
was
raised
in
both
of
those.
but
in
each
instance
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
supreme
court
denied
the
appeal,
affirmed
the
lower
court
decision.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--your
honor,
i
would
submit
to
you
that
the
answer
is
yes,
that
it's
not
an
unworkable
burden
to
stop
at
that
process
and
perhaps
ask
this
question
and
find
out
at
that
point.
so,
i
wouldn't...
i
don't
want
to
make
the
burden
appear
to
be
more
than
it
in
fact
is.
but
the
facts
are
these
in
the
trial
situation
setting.
the
defendant
was
represented
by
counsel.
counsel
there
present
heard
the
statements
of
his
defendant,
i
believe
had
some
affirmative
duty
also
to
investigate.
but
the
defense
counsel,
the
prosecutor
and
the
judge
having
this
colloquy
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
concluded
with
the
defendant's
statement
saying,
"no,
it
was
commuted
to
a
term
of
years.
"
and
on
its
face
this
record
appeared
to
be
what
it
was,
an
official
record
of
the
sentencing
court,
union
county
circuit
court
for
south
arkansas,
about
25
miles
from
the
louisiana
border,
as
exactly
what
it
was.
and
the
jury
looked
at
it.
it
was
handed
to
them.
they
reviewed
it.
they
had
an
opportunity
to
weigh
it
and
consider
it.
i
submit
that
in
fact
it
was
trial
error.
and
if
we
set
the
standard
that
each
time
the
defendant
says,
"i
was
pardoned",
or
"you
have
the
wrong
defendant",
as
justice
kennedy
has
said,
i'm
the
wrong
johnny
lee
nelson
for
that
offense.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
in
a
sense,
your
honor,
that's
a
very--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--good
analogy.
a
very
good
analogy.
it's
like
new
evidence.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
your
honor,
i
suspect
the
answer
to
that
is
yes.
however,
if
you
rule
against
me,
your
honor,
in
the
next
case
in
which
there
is
an
objection
to
evidence
offered,
and
any
objection
offered,
then
the
state,
if
it
is
not
absolutely
correct,
and
there
is
some
error,
i
submit
that
that
defendant
will
come
back
and
argue
to
this
court
or
to
other
courts
in
arkansas
that
a
double
jeopardy
application
should
apply.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
well,
your
honor--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--your
honor,
in
the
instance
we
could
have
telephoned.
i
admitted
that
to
justice
stevens
and
i
do
to
you
too,
justice
marshall,
in
the
sense
that
that
could
have
occurred.
what
in
fact
did
occur,
however,
is
the
situation
in
the
process
of
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
in
arkansas,
as
in
any
other
state,
is
that
if
we
are
going
to
stop
the
process
every
time
a
defendant
says
you've
got
the
wrong
defendant
or
"i
was
pardoned"
for
a
six
minute
phone
call
or
for
a
half-hour
phone
call--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--your
honor,
the
document
was
only
challenged
by
a
statement
by
the
defendant
who
later
recanted,
i
submit
to
you,
by
saying
he
had
had
his
sentence
commutted
to
a
term
of
years.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
i
would
have
said
just
what
i--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--your
honor,
if--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--if
i
learned
16
years
later--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--that
it's
been
pardoned?
i
would
say,
as
i'm
saying
today,
your
honor,
it
was
trial
error.
it's
like
newly-discovered
evidence,
the
analogy
that
justice
scalia
made.
we
didn't
know
at
the
time.
we
relied
upon
the
conviction
upon
its
face.
we
relied
in
good
faith
and
the
jury
considered
it
as
such.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
you're
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
you're
absolutely
correct.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
the
law
in
arkansas,
for
purposes
of
the
habitual
offender
act,
your
honor,
is--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--the
pardon
is
only
inapplicable...
inapplicable
for
use
as
a...
to
count
as
a
prior
conviction
for
habitual
offenses.
the
pardon
itself
will
not
in
fact
erase
the
conviction
and
will
not
prevent
the
conviction
from
being
used
to
deny
one
the
right
to
hold
public
office,
deny
one
the
right
to
own
a
firearm,
deny
one
the
right
to
be
a
law
enforcement
officer
or
other
sorts
of
privileges
granted
by
the
state.
it
has
a
limited
in--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--the
limited
position
is
that
you
can't
count
it
as
a
prior
conviction
for
purposes
of
habitual
offenders.
and
that's
it.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
that
is
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
i
understand,
your
honor.
in
the
instance
of
the
document,
though,
as
mr.
chief
justice
allowed,
the
document
submitted
to
the
court
on
its
face
was
represented
to
be
competent
for
what
it
was
offered.
we
submit
to
this
court
that
that
is
the
better
reason
rule
of
law
in
the
instance
of
the
burden
to
place
upon
the
state
in
trying
its
cases.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
no,
your
honor,
i
wouldn't
say--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--your
honor--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--i'd
like
to
amplify
that
just
a
little
bit.
it
is
sufficient
evidence...
the
appellate
court
on
review
must
look
to
see
if
a
reasonable
jury
could
have
concluded
that
it
was
sufficient
evidence
for
the
purpose
of
conviction.
if
they
did,
if
they
concluded
that,
it
is
trial
error
and
we
get
a
chance
to
try
again.
if
it
was
the
blood
sample
of
some
o-positive
versus
a-negative,
one
a
very
common
source
of
blood,
one
a
very
rare
source
of
blood,
and
it
was
identified
as
such,
then
an
appellant
body
could
say
on
review
it
is
not
reasonable
that
a
jury
could
have
mistaken
o-positive
for
a-negative.
it's
just
not
reasonable.
therefore,
it
was
insufficient
evidence.
the
state
is
bound
by
its
own
error.
that,
i
think,
is
the
rule
of
law.
but
in
the
instance
where...
in
my
case
in
particular,
justice
kennedy,
the
four
convictions
on
their
face
appear
to
be
exactly
what
they
were.
exactly
what
they
were.
the
trial
court
believed
them
to
be
what
they
were.
we
all
believed
them
to
be
what
they
were.
we
discovered
literally
five
and
a
half
years
later
that
one
was
not.
it
was
an
orange,
justice
stevens,
not
an
apple.
and
at
that
point
we
said
what
happened
was
the
state
has
to
rely
upon
someone.
that
someone
is
the
trial
judge
as
to
the
issue
of
admissibility.
secondly,
in
terms
of
whether
it
was
reasonable
to
rely,
we
relied
upon
that
jury.
and
that
jury
heard
all
the
evidence
in
that
colloquy
in
that
testimony,
in
that
courtroom,
and
weighed
it,
and
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
concluded
that
in
fact
we
had
met
our
burden.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor,
i
would
concur.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
the
suggestion,
your
honor...
i
would
say
that
there
was
trial
error
or--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--well,
the
court
in
this
instance
made
error
because
it
admitted
something
that
didn't
have
any
probative
value.
as
justice
marshall
has
indicated
and
i've
stated,
that
under
arkansas
law
a
pardon
conviction
cannot
be
offered
as--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor,
i
agree
with
that.
and
i
agree...
but
i
would
like
to
take
it
one
step
further,
justice
scalia,
to
say
that
in
the
instance
of
what
i
am
trying
to
persuade
this
court,
is
that
in
fact
it
was
admissible
and
it
was
admissible
to
meet
the
standard
required
by
law
in
arkansas
to
pass
the
case
to
the
jury
for
the
purpose
of
them
weighing
that
evidence
to
impose
the
sentence
that
was
provided
by
law.
and
that's
exactly
what
occurred.
it
was
only
after
that
that
we
discovered
that
in
fact
it
was
not
admissible
for
the
purpose
for
which
we
offered
it.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
no,
your
honor,
i
would
not
say
it
was
inadmissible.
you're
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
our
court
didn't
actually...
there
was
no
objection,
justice
marshall.
but
our
court
admitted
it.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
the
appellate
court,
courts
of
appeals,
and
the
supreme
court
in
arkansas
said
that
there
was
no
grounds
to
overturn
the
conviction.
the
district
judge,
judge
elsele,
said
that
in
fact
because
it
was
discovered
later
that
it
was
erroneously
relied
upon,
we
had
incorrectly
received
information
and
because
of
that
we
had
not
met
our
sufficiency
standard
and
ordered
us
to
retry
or
to
release
mr.
nelson.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor,
i
submit
that
he
did,
but
i
submit
that
his
decision
is
in
error
in
terms
of
what
is
the
better
reason
rule
of
law
that
should
be
applied
by
this
court
to
appellate
bodies.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
i'm
not
certain,
your
honor,
that
it
does.
i
would
further
argue
to
this
court
that
in
terms
of
the
standard
that
arkansas
request
that
you
articulate
is
one
that
presents
for
my
state
a
clear
answer
to
a
problem
that
we
are
now
facing
in
the
sense
that
i
have
been
asked
from
time
to
time
why
we
didn't
just
go
back
and
resentence
this
person
and
then
if
it
be
challenged
in
terms
of
double
jeopardy,
produce
this
case
to
this
court
in
a
different
fashion
than
presently
offered.
i
submit
to
you
that's
not
where
we
are.
judge
elsele
said
to
us
we
have
60
days
to
either
release
this
person
or
retry
him
not
as
an
habitual
offender.
we
have
other
convictions
that
we
would
offer
to
retry
this
person,
if
permitted
to
do
such.
i
submit
to
you
that
the
better
reason
rule
of
law
lets
us
have
that
opportunity
because
what
occurred
here
was
we
met
our
sufficiency
standard,
we
filled
up
that
barrel
with
apples.
we
learned
after,
and
much
like
a
motion
for
newly-discovered
evidence
in
terms
of
setting
aside
the
procedure
that
one
of
those
apples
was
an
orange.
and
because
of
that,
we
should
have
an
opportunity
to
retry
this
matter.
i'd
like
to,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
mr.
chief
justice,
just
two
points
i'd
like
to
make.
in
this
case
we're
talking
about
sentencing
not
lesser
included
offenses.
had
we
failed
to
meet
the
four
prior
convictions
standard
or
didn't
have
four
prior
convictions,
mr.
nelson
would
have
to
be
sentenced
as
a
burglar
and
the
range
is
three
to
twenty
years...
because
we
would
have
only
had
three.
the
second
point
is
we
asked
for
the
opportunity
to--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--it
is
a
separate
process,
justice
o'connor,
in
which
we
must
meet
that
burden
of
proof.
if
we
didn't
have
it,
we
just
can't
apply
it.
we
submit
to
you
that
we
have
it,
but
that's
a
different
issue.
the
second
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
to
this
court
is
that
we
believe
that
the
better
reason
rule
of
law
gives
us
the
opportunity
to
make
that
decision.
i
submit
to
this
court
that
there
are
two
prior
convictions
upon
which
we
can
rely.
i've
researched
the
record
and
know
that
for
a
fact.
but
it's
not
a
matter
of
whether
he
could
make
an
habitual
offender
statute
apply
to
this
defendant,
but
it's
whether
we
have
the
right
to
make
the
decision
if
we
want
to.
and
i
submit
to
you
that
the
better
reason
rule
of
law
gives
us
that
opportunity.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
