we'll
go
now
to
the
argument
of
no.
87-1277,
lockhart
against
nelson.
general
clark,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
because
of
the
multiple
offender
aspect?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
actually,
there
was
a
colloquy.
was
mr.
keaton
the
defense
attorney
or--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--where
the
court
says,
""i
think
he
cleared
it
up
himself
when
he
said
it
was
commuted
to
time
served",
is
that
what
you
said?
"
and
the
defendant
says,
"yes,
sir".
then
the
court
says,
"does
that
answer
your
question?
"
"it
was
commuted
to
time
served.
"
"it's
not
a
pardon.
"
"do
you
agree,
mr.
keaton?
"
and
mr.
keaton,
the
defense
attorney,
says,
"well,
that's
the
way
it
sounds
to
me.
"
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
this
case
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
or
it
was
appealed
to
the
arkansas
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
you
say
a
document
is
challenged...
there
was
nothing
wrong,
i
take
it,
with
the
certificate
of
conviction.
the
conviction
actually
had
taken
place.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
the
existence
of
another
document,
the
pardon,
if
those
are
documents
that
render
the
first
document
not
usable
for
the
purpose
you
wanted
to
use
it
for.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
think
even
there
perhaps
that's
not
entirely
accurate.
supposing
that
in
an
action
i
offer
a
promissory
note
all
duly
executed
and
so
on,
and
no
one
objects.
the
notes
comes
in.
well,
it
turns
out
later
that
the
payee
has
released
the
note.
and
if
that
release
is
offered,
it
will
show
the
promissory
note
carries
no
obligation,
although
without
the
release
it
obviously
does.
well,
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
promissory
note
was
inadmissible.
it
just
means,
like
in
your
case,
that
there
was
another
document
which
when
introduced
would
show
that
the
promissory
note
was
no
longer
enforceable.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
clark.
mr.
hall,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
surely
the
defense
was
on
notice
too.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
if
exactly
those
same
facts...
where
there
is
no
evidence
of
sandbagging...
on
justice
stevens'
hypothesis...
so
that
it's
all
the
same
except
it
all
comes
out
60
days
after
the...
or
30
days
after
the
judgment
of
conviction?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hall.
mr.
clark,
do
you
have
anything
more,
general
clark?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
clark.
the
case
is
submitted.
