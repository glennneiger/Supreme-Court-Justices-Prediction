mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
what
the
state
is
asking
for
here
is
an
opportunity
to
get
a
chance
to
resentence
this
man
to
fill
a
void
in
its
proof
six
and
a
half...
if
the
trial
is
later,
seven
years,
seven
and
a
half
years...
after
the
fact.
what
the
court
is
asking
them
to
do,
asking
you
to
do,
is
to
call
its
orange
an
apple
in
effect,
pretend
it's
an
apple
to
let
them
get
over
the
sufficiency
hurdle.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
that's
true.
but
at
the
time
that
it
was
offered,
the
state
was
on
notice
that
it
was
pardoned
and
the
state
made
no
effort
to
inquire.
the
colloquy
that
occurred
happened
on
the
record
with
mr.
nelson
as
a
witness.
he
was
being
examined,
apparently,
by
his
own
lawyer.
the
prosecutor
asked
his
questions,
the
court
asked
him
questions.
then
he
responded
to
a
leading
question
and
said,
"yes,
i
guess
it's
been
reduced
to
time
served.
"
and
that's
how
the
court
let
it
go
to
the
jury.
he
said
very
clearly,
"i've
been
pardoned.
"
"i
have
papers
on
that
at
home.
"
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
yes,
the
defense
was
on
notice.
but
keep
in
mind
that
this
defense
counsel
i
didn't
do
a
very
good
job
of
trial
and
didn't
even
follow
the
appeal
he
was
required
to
do
so.
mr.
nelson
had
to
have
a
belated
appeal
granted
by
the
arkansas
supreme
court.
let
me
give
you
the
chronology
in
this
case
because
the
chronology
is
important
to
how
it
occurred.
he
was
charged
first
in
early
1979.
his
case
number
is
cr-79-22.
he
was
convicted
before
a
jury
on
the
first
trial
and
got
40
years.
this
was
in
1980.
that
conviction
was
reversed
because
the
prosecuting
attorney
withheld
discoverable
material
and
the
case
was
sent
back
for
retrial.
it
was
reversed
in
1981.
when
it
came
back
in
1982,
mr.
nelson
pled
guilty
and
asked
to
have
the
sentence
in
question
submitted
to
the
jury.
and
that's
where
the
pardon
prior
conviction
first
came
up.
now,
there
were
three
convictions
from
1960.
the
state
only
chose
to
use
one
of
them.
another
conviction,
number
90-90
that's
in
our
footnote
1,
may
be
invalid.
it
was
a
pre-gideon
conviction
that
does
not
apparently
show
counsel.
that's
probably
why
the
state
didn't
offer
it
in
the
first
place.
the
one
that
was
used
here,
number
9078,
did
in
fact
show
counsel.
the
other
conviction,
number
9065,
the
earlier
conviction...
i
don't
recall
now
whether
that
one
shows
counsel
or
not.
i
think
it
was
from
a
guilty
plea;
it
probably
does
not.
and
one
of
the
other
convictions
the
state
did
in
fact
used
that's
never
been
challenged
before
and
is
waiting
for
when
this
case
comes
back,
cr
74-137,
also
used...
it's
just
a
printed
form
that
says
he
appeared
with
his
attorney
with
no
name
mentioned.
that
conviction
itself
may
be
invalid
under
state
law.
anyway,
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury.
the
jury
came
out
and
found
him
guilty...
of
course,
because
he
pled
guilty...
and
sentenced
him
to
20
years
at
a
minimum.
now,
one
of
the...
there
is
a
problem
in
my
brief,
an
inconsistent
statement
of
fact.
i
want
to
clarify
it.
at
page
12
i
talk
about
their
being
lessers
submitted
to
the
jury.
in
fact,
no
lessers
were
submitted
to
the
jury.
it
was
submitted
as
four
priors
or
not
guilty.
and
that's
kind
of
incongruous
because
he
did
in
fact
plead
guilty.
so,
the
jury
had
to
find
four
priors
or
let
him
go.
anyway,
after
the
conviction
no
appeal
was
lodged
by
his
lawyer.
he
wrote
a
pro
se
petition
to
the
arkansas
supreme
court.
they
granted
a
belated
appeal
in
1983.
the
case
goes
to
the
arkansas
court
of
appeals
in
1984
and
in
that
court
mr.
nelson's
counsel,
another
appointed
counsel,
says,
"he
was
pardoned
in
this
case.
"
and
the
state's
response
was,
"he
just
said
he
was
pardoned.
"
"that's
not
good
enough.
"
"he
said
a
trial.
"
"i
though
it
was
pardoned.
"
"but
they
didn't
put
in
a
document.
"
"he
conceded
at
trial
that
it
was
reduced
time
served.
"
"therefore,
that's
not
good
enough.
"
so,
the
arkansas
supreme
court
affirmed...
or,
court
of
appeals
affirms.
this
time
pro
se
he
seeks
post-conviction
relief
and
he
writes
a
handwritten
petition
to
the
arkansas
supreme
court
raising
the
same
issue.
that
he
was
pardoned
on
that
prior
conviction.
the
state
of
arkansas
says,
he
just
alleged
it,
that's
not
good
enough.
now,
all
this
time
nobody
bothered
to
call
the
secretary
of
state
because
this
conviction
was
a
matter
of
judicial
notice.
it
could
have
gone
in
with
the
pardon.
it
could
have
gone
in
by
judicial
notice
under
arkansas
law.
but
nobody
made
an
effort
to
find
out.
his
own
counsel
didn't.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
at
that
time
they
could
have
resubmitted
only
the
three
prior
convictions.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
in
that
particular
case
you'd
have
the
question
of
he
moved
to
set
aside
the
conviction.
having
set
aside
the
conviction
on
his
own
motion,
he
now
is
subject
to
being
retried,
and
whatever
evidence
could
be
produced...
it
would
be
like
a
mistrial
mid-trial
maybe.
or,
a
mistrial--
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
--well,
the
question
is
double
jeopardy
finality.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
in
this
particular
case
here
we
are
talking
about
it
seven
and
a
half
years
later.
and
this
is
the
outer
extreme
of
finality.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
well,
everybody
is
responsible
for
the
delay.
the
defendant
probably
for
not
bringing
the
conviction
to
court.
he
should
have,
i
suppose,
told
his
lawyer.
and
then
if
he
told
his
lawyer,
the
lawyer
might
have
said,
well,
they
won't
use
a
pardoned
conviction,
and
they
did.
nobody
was
prepared
at
the
trial.
nobody
was
prepared
at
the
appeal.
this
case
just
got
short-shift
all
the
way
through
the
system.
but
the
problem
is
mr.
nelson
ended
up
doing
five
and
a
half
extra
years
as
a
result
of
this
problem.
this
happened
in
march
of
1982.
but
here
we
are
now
in
1988
still
questioning
what
happened.
i
don't
know
if
you
can
talk
about
equities
in
a
habeas
case,
but--
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
--on
that
particular
type
of
situation
other
consideration
might
come
in,
like
whether
the
defendant
was
sandbagging
the
state,
for
instance,
and
letting
this
go
to
the
jury
for
the
purpose
of
causing
that
kind
of
error.
and
there
is
no
evidence
that
that
happened
here.
mr.
nelson
raised
that
question
before
it
went
to
the
jury.
on
the
stand--
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
--then
it
would
still
be
barred
by
double
jeopardy
assuming
the
defendant
didn't
participate
such
that
he
could
be
charged
with
some
participation
in
the
occurrence.
like
in
this
case,
you
know,
mr.
nelson
didn't
know
the
difference.
he
was
relying
on
a
court-appointed
counsel.
the
court-appointed
counsel
let
him
down.
the
prosecutor
let
him
down.
the
trial
court
let
him
down.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
another
person
was
killed?
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
well,
that's
not--
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
--well,
you
wouldn't
even
have
a
double
jeopardy
problem
because
you're
talking
about
another
victim.
we
can
set
aside
the
conviction
for--
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
--but
you're
talking
about
a
person
who
was
convicted
of
killing
person
"a"
when
in
fact
he
killed
person
"b"?
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
the
question
of
trial
error
has
to
be
looked
at
in
terms
of
he
and
the
prosecutor
cure
the
error
given
an
opportunity
to
put
more
proof.
in
this
situation
they
can't
cure
the
error
because
no
amount
of
proof
is
going
to
set
aside
that
pardon.
in
that
particular
situation
you
could
say
that's
it's
a
question
of
admissibility
of
evidence,
foundation
of
evidence.
they
had
improper
foundation,
the
court
read
in
the
wrong
evidence,
the
witness
was
recanting,
or
whatever,
and
that
would
probably
go
down
as
a
trial
error,
not
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
it
wasn't
insufficiency
at
all.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
well,
the--
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
--perjured
testimony
doesn't
guarantee
you're
going
to
be
able
to
set
aside
a
conviction
either.
the
interesting
finality
requires
such
a
high
burden
to
set
it
aside
under
arkansas
law--
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
--they
shouldn't,
but
they
would
have
some
difficulty
in
arkansas,
yes.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
well,
i've
been
trying
to
set
aside
convictions
there
for
a
long
time
in
a
lot
of
cases
and
it's
hard
to
do.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
with
newly-discovered
evidence
even.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
even
with
newly-discovered
evidence
that
shows
a
person
is
not
guilty
it's
hard
to
get
a
new
trial
in
arkansas.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
well,
even
a
person
recanting
isn't
always
necessarily
taken
to
be
positive
evidence.
we
have
a
method
of
doing
that.
once
a
conviction
has
gone
through
an
appeal
in
arkansas,
it's
over.
the
only
remedy
you
have
is
to
go
through
a
pardon.
the
arkansas
supreme
courts
have
been
very
clear
on
that.
no
matter
what
happens,
newly-discovered
evidence,
perjured
testimony,
recanted
witnesses,
whatever.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
maybe
you
can,
but
you
have
to
do
it
by
a
pardon
and
not
through
the
courts.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
the
state
in
this
case
denies
that
it
had
its
one
fair
opportunity
to
put
on
proof.
i'm
taking
that
language,
"the
one
fair
opportunity",
from
burks.
but
in
this
case,
it
had
its
fair
opportunity,
and
that
was
the
jury
trial
with
jury
sentencing.
it
offered
the
evidence,
the
defendant
objected
to
it
personally,
the
state
was
on
notice
at
the
time.
it
could
have
called
a
circuit
clerk
about
other
convictions.
it
could
have
called
the
secretary
of
state.
it
could
have
called
the
department
of
correction,
which
is
what
it
did
after
the
pardon
was...
the
district
court
requested
the
pardon
to
be
determined.
and
it
could
have
provided
additional
evidence
if
it
had
any.
and
it
chose
not
to.
if
that's
not
really
one
fair
opportunity
to
put
on
its
proof,
i
don't
know
what
is
under
burks.
it
had
its
opportunity.
now,
the
parties
in
the
briefs
talk
about
overtrying
the
case.
will
they
be
required
to
over-try
the
case
whenever
an
objection
is
made?
everybody
is
well
familiar
with
what
the
standards
are
to
get
over
a
corrected
verdict,
what
the
standards
are
for
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
on
appeal.
if
there
is
almost
any
probative
evidence
in
the
record
at
all,
that's
going
to
be
enough.
if
in
this
particular
case
there
was
another...
a
fifth
conviction,
for
instance,
and
it
was
only
alluded
to
and
a
certified
copy
wasn't
in,
someone
may
say
that
was
sufficient
to
overcome
it
because
whether
or
not
looking
at
all
the
evidence
in
a
light
most
favorable
to
the
state,
a
jury
could
reasonably
conclude
the
proposition
that
the
state
put
forward.
if
the
particular
place
of
evidence
is
critical
to
the
case
and
it's
objected
to,
then
logically
you're
going
to
want
to
put
more
on.
if
it's
a
piece
of
rank
hearsay,
for
instance,
you're
going
to
want
to
back
it
up
because
there's
always
the
possibility
the
jury
may
disbelieve
hearsay
because
juries
sometimes
do
that.
and
also,
there's
always
the
possibility
that
the
prosecutor
at
least
wants
to
get
enough
evidence
in
the
record
to
maintain
getting
past
a
directed
verdict.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
to
what
degree
you're
talking
about,
justice
kennedy,
but
under
arkansas
law
he
has
no
state
remedy.
he
has
one
post-conviction
petition
which
he
filed,
and
he
did
it
himself
so
it
wasn't
very
artfully
drafted.
it
wasn't
backed
up
with
the
pardon
like
it
should
have
been.
he's
out
of
state
court.
his
only
remedy
is
to
go
to
federal
court.
and
in
federal
court
finally
he
started
the
process
himself.
he
filed
the
handwritten
petition.
the
state
produced
the
pardon
on
request,
and
that's
the
first
time
he
had
counsel
appointed,
was
after
the
pardon
was
produced.
and
that's
the
first
time
the
double
jeopardy
issue
arose.
the
background
of
the
question
making
the
record,
the
state's
authorities
that
they
cite,
page
5
of
the
reply
brief,
talk
about
proffered
evidence
and
that's
exactly
what
we
talk
about
in
our
brief.
but
if
the
evidence
is
there,
it's
alluded
to.
it's
proffered
to
the
court.
then
on
appeal,
the
court
can
refer
to
it
even
though
it's
not
in
the
record
because
proffered
evidence
forms
the
basis
of
many
appeals
under
rule
103
of
the
rules
of
evidence.
and,
of
course,
the
arkansas
state
rule
is
the
uniform
rules,
which
is
almost
identical
to
the
federal
rule.
and,
if
there
was
no
evidence
referred
to
in
the
record,
then
of
course
you
can't
rely
on
it
and
you
can't
speculate
as
to
whatever
other
evidence
there
was.
several
of
the
appellate
courts,
the
federal
appeals
court
say
we
can't
speculate
as
to
what
there
is.
well,
they
shouldn't
speculate
as
to
what
there
is.
if
there's
been
no
reference
to
it,
then
it
can't
be
relied
on.
it
is
also
possible,
and
i
thought
about
this
in
preparation
to
the
argument
that
the
court
may
concern
itself
with
defrancesco
because
that
dealt
with
a
post-conviction
sentencing
proceeding
where
the
defendant
claimed
double
jeopardy
prevented
a
resentencing.
defrancesco
dealt
with
a
federal
statute
that
dealt
with
a
federal
right
to
appeal
the
sentence
when
the
federal
government
decides
it
didn't
like
the
length
of
a
sentence.
here,
in
arkansas,
there
is
no
right
to
appeal
a
jury
sentence.
neither
side
can
appeal
it.
it's
possible
that
you
could
do
it
on
post-conviction
relief
through
proportionality
review,
but
then
you'd
have
to
put
on
proof
and
establish
the
proportionality
review,
but
then
you'd
have
to
put
on
proof
and
establish
the
proportionality
question.
proof
of
enhancement
factors
in
defrancesco
was
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
tried
separately
to
the
judge.
in
this
particular
case,
it's
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
tried
to
the
jury.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
well,
that's
not
necessarily
a
clear
question
either,
if
it
goes
whether
this
is
procedural
or
substantive.
the
crime
was
in
1979.
the
statute
was
changed
in
'81.
the
first
trial
was
in
1980.
and
if
the
judge
were
operating
under
what
benefits
accrued
the
defendant
under
the
pretrial
or
the
prior
trial,
then
he
would
give
him
the
benefit
of
the
1980
version
of
the
statute.
so,
while
judge
lay
and
the
court
of
appeals
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
trial
court
might
have
acted
erroneously,
it's
not
really
clear
that
the
trial
court
did
act
erroneously
in
how
it
was
submitted.
and,
of
course,
that
may
raise
another
question
too.
whether
or
not
submitting
it
to
the
judge
separately
denies
six
men
a
right
to
try
a
fact
to
a
jury.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
well,
two
courts
discussed
it
at
great
length
and
if,
for
instance,
the
jury
had
the
conviction
submitted
to
them
and
they
decided
in
this
case,
we
buy
mr.
nelson's
statement,
we
find
beyond...
find
the
state
failed
to
prove
four
priors
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
the
only
option
they
would
have
had
was
to
have
acquitted
him.
the
state
would
have
had
no
right
to
appeal.
that
would
have
been
final,
no
matter
how
erroneous,
even
though
he
pled
guilty.
and
that's
the
reference
to
all
these
cases
the
courts
had.
that
we
grant
finality
no
matter
how
erroneous.
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
there
are
two
levels.
no
priors
and
one
prior
has
no
enhancement.
two
and
three
priors
is
first
level
of
enhancement,
and
it's
the
same
minimum,
but
fifty--
mr.
john
wesley
hall,
jr.
--i
think
that
they
could
have
if
they
had
submitted
the
question
of
lessers
to
the
jury
in
the
first
instance.
under
arkansas
law,
it's
statutory
how
it's
done.
if
there
is
any
evidence
to
support
a
lesser,
it's
submitted
to
the
jury.
if
the
defendant
so
requests.
and
the
defendant
can
elect
not
to.
in
this
particular
case
the
jury
had
four
more
or
not
guilty.
if
they
had
said,
we
can
find
four
more,
two
or
three,
or
less
than
two,
then
that
would
be
the
posture
we're
in.
but
that's
not
before
the
court
because
nobody
asked
for
lesser
included
offenses.
now,
there
are
cases
from
some
of
the
appellate
courts
that
would
allow
a
remand.
for
instance,
suppose
there
are
four
elements
of
proof
in
a
particular
case.
one
of
those
elements
is
required
for
first
degree
murder
and
it's
not
proved.
the
remaining
evidence
shows
the
defendant
guilty
of
second
degree
murder
but
it
was
submitted
to
the
jury
only
on
first
degree
and
the
court
reverses
it.
under
arkansas
law,
i
submit,
you'd
have
to
send
it
back
and
find
the
man
not
guilty.
if
a
lesser
included
offense
were
submitted,
the
court
could
say
we
find
him
not
guilty
of
first
degree
murder
because
of
failure
of
proof
but
direct
the
lower
court
to
enter
a
judgment
of
second
degree.
but
that's
not
the
case
here.
thank
you.
