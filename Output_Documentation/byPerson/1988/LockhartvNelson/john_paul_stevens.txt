justice
john
paul
stevens
attorney
general
clark,
couldn't
one
argue...
i
don't
know
if
it
would
be
a
correct
argument...
that
one
of
your
four
apples
really
wasn't
an
apple?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
therefore
it's
really
a
burks
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
this.
supposing
the
defense
lawyer...
you
put
in
your
four
apples--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
on
the
face
of
the
record
you're
got
a
sufficient
case.
the
defendant's
lawyer
comes
in
and
puts
in
the
pardon
in
the
record.
the
judge
submits
the
thing
to
the
jury,
the
issue
to
the
jury,
and
the
jury
says
there
are
four
convictions,
enhance
punishment.
but
on
appeal,
the
appellant
court
would
say,
well,
that
fourth
of
the
pardon
really
meant
that
that
was
not
a
fourth
apple.
what
do
you
do
in
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
clark,
maybe
this
is
an
unfair
question,
but
i
wonder
why
when
the
defendant
made
the
objection
he
did,
why
somebody
didn't
find
out
what
the
facts
were
instead
of
just
relying
on
his
recollection
of
some
20
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
it
pretty
easy
to
call
up
and
find
out
if
there
had
been
a
pardon?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
hall,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
supposing
right
after
this
error
occurred,
and
so
forth,
within
say
60
days
the
lawyer
had
followed
through
on
it,
found
out
there
was
a
pardon,
went
in
immediately
to
the
trial
judge
and
said,
"your
honor,
i
found
out
there
was
a
pardon
here.
"
"i
move
to
set
aside
the
conviction
on
the
ground
there
are
only
three
apples.
"
the
judge
said,
"relief
granted".
the
prosecutor
then
said,
"okay.
"
"i'd
like
to
retry
the
man
and
put
in
the
fourth
conviction.
"
at
that
time,
would
double
jeopardy
have
prevented
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
three?
could
they
have
said,
"well,
in
view
of
this
development,
we'd
like
to
reopen
the
record
and
put
in
what
we
believe
to
be
other
valid
convictions.
"
and
you'd
dispute
them.
could
they
have
done
it
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
would
that
situation
be
any...
why
should
the
rule
be
any
different
in
that
situation
than
the
one
you've
got
today.
here
we've
had
a
collateral
attack
on
the
conviction.
it's
been
set
aside.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
should
your
defendant
get
the
benefit
of
the
fact
that
he's
seven
years
late
in
succeeding
with
what
he
should
have
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court
right
away,
if
he
knew
the
facts
and
if
his
lawyer
checked
it
out?
i
mean,
who
is
responsible
for
this
delay?
is
it
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
if
the
double
jeopardy
isn't
kind
of
an
equitable
doctrine...
it's
kind
of
a
firm
rule
of
law...
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
the
state
is
barred
now,
it
would
also
have
been
barred
if
they'd
raised
it
just
a
few...
you
know,
30
or
60
days
later...
brought
out
the
fact
that
there
in
fact,
there
were
only
three
apples
and
you
need
four.
