justice

marshall
mr.
attorney
general,
you
did
mislead
the
trial
court,
didn't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
did
give
them
what
was
a
conviction
that
had
actually
been
pardoned?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
did
present
that
to
the
court
deliberately?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
weren't
you
obliged
to
find
out
whether
it
was
a
valid
conviction
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
present
it
as
a
valid
conviction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
wasn't.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
should
have
known
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
don't
you
admit
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--and
the
lawyer
when
he
presented
evidence
to
the
court
supported
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
didn't
support
it,
did
you?
or,
did
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
was
wrong,
wasn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wasn't
it
wrong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
w-r-o-n-g?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
could
it
be
valid
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
your
court
said
it
was
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
should
i
listen
to
your
court
or
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn't--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--didn't
you
know
about
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
when
it
was
pardoned
wasn't
your
office
notified?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
the
government
pardons
somebody
and
didn't
tell
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
where
is
that
in
this
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
where...
i'm
sorry,
i
have
to
take
your
word
for
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
wasn't
true.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
attorney
general--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--if
we
rule
against
you,
and
the
next
case
comes
up
like
that,
they'll
find
out,
won't
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
suggest,
as
justice
stevens
says,
you
could
have
telephoned,
which
would
take
about
six
minutes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
next
case,
you'll
call
up.
it
won't
interrupt
the
trial.
it'll
just
take
about
two
or
three
minutes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
let
me
bring
about
any
time...
this
is
where
a
document
has
been
challenged.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
it
had
come
up
16
years
later,
what
would
you
have
said?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
it
was
a
valid
conviction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
have
said
it's
a
valid
conviction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
the
document
not
usable
or
invalid?
what
is
the
law
in
arkansas?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
the
law
on
a
pardon?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
what
is
the
limited
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's
all
i'm
talking
about.
i'm
not
talking
about--
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
did
your
court
say?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
talking
about
the
appellate
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
--while
you're
out
on
these
hypothetical
cases,
what
if
there
was
perjured
testimony,
would
anybody
have
any
problems
with
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--testimony,
wouldn't
it?
it
would
just
be
automatically
reversed,
wouldn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
a
court
have
any
trouble
in
setting
aside
a
conviction
based
on
perjured
testimony?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
would
in
arkansas?
i
though
arkansas
said
you
couldn't
do
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i'm
talking
about
in
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
perjured
testimony
is
different
from
newly-discovered
evidence.
justice
thurgood
marshall
--i
wouldn't
say
that.
you've
had
several
arkansas
cases
that
have
been
done
right
in
the
court.
i
know
of
several
of
them
myself.
