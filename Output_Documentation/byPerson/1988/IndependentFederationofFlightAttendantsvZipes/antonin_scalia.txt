justice
scalia
we
would
certainly
rather,
you
would
think,
favor
a
rule
that
would
induce
you
to
come
in
as
soon
as
possible
and
get
the
whole
thing
resolved
in
one
fell
swoop,
right?
justice
scalia
yeah.
justice
scalia
that's
reasonable
enough.
but
maybe
that's
why...
that
may
be
why
congress
said
"may
allow"
instead
of
shall
allow.
justice
scalia
i
don't
think
they
go
quite
that
far.
they
say
upon
an
intervenor
who
is
not
guilty
of
the
wrong
doing
that
was
the
subject
of
the
suit.
justice
scalia
is
there
any
support
for
the
proposition
that
you
cannot
impose
fees
upon
an
intervenor
whose
intervention
has
in
no
way
prolonged
the
suit
or
caused
any
additional
expenses?
justice
scalia
i
understand
it.
but...
but
it
seems
to
me
that...
that
one
might
adopt
under
this
statute
an
absolute
rule
that
where
an
intervenor...
as
opposed
to
the
defendant...
hasn't
prolonged
the
suit
at
all...
he
just
happens
to
be
another
party,
he
hasn't
caused
any
additional
expense...
no
costs
can
be
asserted
against
an
individual...
against
an
intervenor.
i
think
you
could
adopt
that
absolute
control
of
the
district
court's
discretion,
couldn't
you?
justice
scalia
okay.
justice
scalia
oh,
expenses
have
been
incurred
in
the
suit.
i'm
not
saying
that
the
plaintiff
didn't
have
any
expenses.
but
they
were
no
greater
expenses
because
of
the
intervenor
than
they
would
have
been
had
the
intervenor
not
been
in
the
case.
justice
scalia
he
could...
well--
justice
scalia
--can
a
court
split
the
fee
award
between
the
defendant
and
the
intervenor?
say,
the
defendant
pays
half
and
the
intervenor
pays
half.
justice
scalia
well,
you'd
say
no,
i
think.
i
think
anybody
would
say
no.
and
i
think
we
would
reverse,
as
an
abusive
discretion,
any
award
because
of
the
word
"may"
here...
it
does
say
may...
but
it
would
be
abusive
discretion
to
allow
an
award
against
an
intervenor
in
that
situation.
justice
scalia
so,
you
have
to
acknowledge
that
there
is
room
under
this
statute
to
have
some
absolutes.
even
though
it
says
discretion,
it
means
reasonable
discretion.
justice
scalia
but
why
is
that?
you
come
here
and
you
say
the
statute
says
against
the...
the
prevailing
party
is
entitled
to
award.
you
say
it's
treated
like
costs.
costs
are
paid
by
parties,
whether
the
party
is
blameworthy
or
not.
why...
why
wouldn't
you
split
it
between
the
intervenor
and
the
defendant?
you've
told
us
that
blame
doesn't
make
any
difference.
justice
scalia
why
not?
the
intervenor
made
the
same
argument
the
defendant
did.
it
just
didn't
cause
the
litigation
to
drag
on
any
longer.
that's
all.
justice
scalia
the
same
argument.
yes.
justice
scalia
yes.
absolutely.
justice
scalia
you'd
award
the
fee
against
both
of
them?
is
that
right?
justice
scalia
one
of
them
was
guilty
of
a
violation
of
law--
justice
scalia
--and
the
other
one
wasn't.
you're
just
unwilling
to
take
that
distinction
into
account.
that's--
justice
scalia
--the
question
is
whether
congress
meant
to
exclude
the
courts
from
taking
that
distinction
into
account
within
the
word
may,
whether
that's
one
of
the
discretionary
factors
the
courts
can
consider.
justice
scalia
mr.
fehr,
how
does...
i'm
not
sure
this...
this
works,
but
i
think
it
works.
suppose
the
stewardesses
bring...
bring
suit
here
and...
and
twa
comes
in
and
says,
"you
got
us,
we're
guilty.
"
but
your
union
intervenes
and
says,
"no,
you're
not.
"
"we
don't
think
you're
guilty.
"
"we
think
everything's
all
right.
"
okay?
and
it's
only
because
of...
of
your
union
that
the
suit
goes
forward
at
all.
then,
what
happens?
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
just
doesn't
get
any
fees?
justice
scalia
or
does
it--
justice
scalia
--get
all
the
fees
against
twa
who
wanted
to
get
out
of
this--
justice
scalia
--thing
by
pleading
guilty?
justice
scalia
yeah,
but
twa
says,
"i'm
guilty".
you
know,
"enter
the
judgment
against
me".
justice
scalia
but
the
union
says,
"no,
don't
do
that.
"
"we
don't
think
you're
guilty.
"
and
three
years
worth
of
litigation
ensues.
