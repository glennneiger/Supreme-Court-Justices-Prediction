mr.
steven
a.
fehr
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
an
award
of
attorney's
fees
pursuant
to
section
706(k)
of
title
vii
in
favor
of
the
settling
plaintiffs
and
against
a
union
when
that
union
was
not
a
defendant
and
intervened
only
because
the
settlement
agreement
would
override
the
union's
contract
and
impair
the
seniority
rights
and
job
security
of
its
members.
petitioner
iffa
is
the
labor
union
which
represents
twa's
flight
attendants.
in
1970,
the
union
which
formerly
represented
twa's
flight
attendants
filed
charges
in
this
class
action
suit
challenging
twa's
practice
of
terminating
all
flight
attendants
who
became
mothers.
the
class
was
defined
as
all
flight
attendants
so
terminated
from
1965
forward.
two
months
later,
the
union
successfully
negotiated
the
elimination
of
the
"no-mothers"
policy
pursuant
to
a
new
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
case
was
settled
in
1971,
but
the
seventh
circuit
reversed
the
district
court's
approval
of
that
settlement
because
of
a
conflict
of
interest
it
perceived
between
the
union's
obligations
to
the
class
members
on
one
hand
and
its
duties
to
represent
the
incumbent
employees
on
the
other.
and
it
was
those
same
duties,
of
course,
which
brought
about
iffa's
intervention
years
later.
but,
at
that
point,
in
1973,
the
union
and
union
counsel
were
replaced
as
class
representative
and
class
counsel
by
the
parties
and
counsel
who
had
brought
that
appeal.
in
1976,
the
district
court
held
that
twa's
policy
was
indeed
illegal
and
that
all
plaintiffs
had
timely
claims
for
the
reason
that
twa
had
engaged
in
the
so-called
continuing
violation.
the
seventh
circuit
reversed
again
in
1978,
holding
that
while
the
policy
was
illegal,
twa
had
not
engaged
in
a
continuing
violation,
and
that
the
claims
of
92
percent
of
the
plaintiffs
were
therefore
time-barred.
in
response
to
a
secondary
argument
made
by
plaintiffs
to
the
effect
that
twa
had
waived
its
timeliness
defense,
the
seventh
circuit
said
that
it
need
not
address
that
issue
because
the
title
vii
time
limit
was
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite
which
could
not
be
waived.
the
plaintiff
sought
certiorari
on
the
jurisdictional
issue
only.
twa
cross-petitioned,
but
consideration
of
those
petitions
was
deferred
when
the
parties
announced
yet
another
settlement.
pursuant
to
this
new
settlement,
the
class
was
divided
into
two
subclasses;
subclass
a
consisting
of
the
approximately
30
women
with
timely
claims,
and
subclass
b
consisting
of
the
approximately
400
women
with
untimely
claims.
twa
was
to
pay
$3
million,
one
half
to
each
subclass.
counsel
fees
were
to
be
deducted
from
the
settlement
fund.
plaintiffs
were
to
be
able
to
regain
their
jobs
and
obtain
a
grant
of
retroactive
competitive
seniority
from
original
date
of
hire
through
the
date
the
settlement
agreement
was
signed
in
1979.
and,
last
but
not
least,
the
settlement
agreement
specifically
purported
to
supersede
prior,
current,
and
future
collective
bargaining
agreements.
at
that
point,
in
1979,
iffa,
which
had
come
into
existence
in
1977,
intervened
to
contest
the
grant
of
seniority
to
the
class
members
because
of
the
effect
we
believed
that
seniority
would
have
upon
the
incumbents.
as
part
of
our
arguments,
we
contended
that
if
in
fact
there
was
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction
over
the
claims
of
subclass
b,
as
the
seventh
circuit
had
already
held,
then
the
district
court
had
no
power
to
grant
seniority
to
those
individuals
and
override
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
on
behalf
of
those
plaintiffs
with
jurisdictionally
defective
claims.
the
district
court
overruled
that
argument,
saying
that
it
need
not
heed
the
opinion
of
the
seventh
circuit
finding
a
lack
of
jurisdiction
for
the
reason
that
it
was
not
final.
the
seventh
circuit
overruled
us
for
an
entirely
different
reason,
holding
that
a
district
court
need
not
have
subject
matter
jurisdiction
to
issue
orders
pursuant
to
a
settlement
agreement.
iffa
petitioned
for
certiorari,
and
in
march
of
1981
our
petition
was
granted
on
two
issues,
including
the
question
of
whether
a
district
court
had
power
to
issue
orders
pursuant
to
a
settlement
agreement
in
the
face
of
a
holding
by
its
court
of
appeals
that
jurisdiction
was
lacking.
at
the
same
time,
however,
the
court
granted
the
petitions
of
twa
and
plaintiffs
which
had
been
held
in
abeyance
since
1978.
in
the
zipes
opinion
in
1982,
the
court
chose
not
to
decide
the
jurisdictional
issue
we
had
framed
in
no.
80-951
but,
instead,
decided
that
the
seventh
circuit
had
been
wrong
when
it
had
previously
held
that
the
title
vii
time
limit
was
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite
which
could
not
under
any
circumstances
be
waived.
the
court
went
on
to
affirm
the
orders
approving
the
settlement
and
granting
seniority
to
the
plaintiffs.
now,
the
primary
reason
iffa
had
fought
the
grant
of
seniority
was
that
it
feared
that
the
twa
flight
attendant
work
force
was
about
to
enter
a
period
where
it
would
not
only
not
expand
but
actually
significantly
shrink.
as
it
happened,
from
mid-1979
when
the
settlement
was
announced,
until
mid-1983,
twa
furloughed
several
hundred
flight
attendants
and
hired
none.
when
expansion
finally
came,
those
openings
went
not
to
the
incumbent
furloughees,
but
to
the
plaintiffs
because
of
the
seniority
granted
to
them.
the
reentry
of
hundreds
of
plaintiffs
into
the
work
force
blocked
the
recall
of
159
furloughees
who
eventually
dropped
off
the
employment
rolls
due
to
a
five-year
contractual
limitation
on
furlough
status.
and,
finally,
we
get
to
the
subject
of
attorney's
fees.
in
1982
plaintiff's
counsel
sought
and
were
awarded
nearly
$1.4
million
from
the
$3
million
settlement
fund.
of
that
amount,
$1,250,000
was
paid
for
pre-settlement
work
at
a
multiplier
of
two.
meanwhile,
the
typical
subclass
b
member
who
had
been
away
from
her
job
as
a
flight
attendant
for
13
to
18
years,
received
approximately
$2,000
in
back
pay.
counsel
also
sought
fees
against
twa
and
iffa
for
the
litigation
in
regard
to
the
settlement,
and
in
1986
the
district
court
denied
the
request
for
further
fees
against
twa,
holding
that
plaintiffs
had
waived
any
further
fees
from
twa
in
the
settlement
agreement.
however,
the
district
court
assessed
fees
against
iffa
in
an
amount
exceeding
$180,000
because,
in
the
view
of
the
district
court,
prevailing
plaintiffs
are
almost
automatically
entitled
to
an
award
of
attorney's
fees.
last
year,
a
divided
seventh
circuit
panel
affirmed.
all
of
this
court's
decisions
regarding
civil
rights
attorney's
fees
from
piggle
park,
to
christiansburg,
to
garland
last
month,
make
it
clear
that
equitable
considerations
are
paramount.
as
justice
stewart
said
in
christiansburg,
706(k)
does
not
even
invite,
much
less
require,
a
mechanical
construction.
accordingly,
we
believe
it
appropriate
to
consider
the
very
difficult,
perhaps
nearly
impossible,
quandary
which
iffa
faced
when
it
intervened
in
1979.
and
that
dilemma
was
brought
about
not
just
by
the
facts
i've
outlined,
but
also
by
the
changing
state
of
the
law,
as
best
demonstrated
by
the
then
very
recent
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
franks
case
in
1976
and
the
teamsters
case
in
1977.
in
franks,
the
court
held
that
successful
title
vii
plaintiffs
are
ordinarily
entitled
to
a
grant
of
retroactive
competitive
seniority
unless
that
seniority
will
have
unusual
adverse
impact
upon
the
incumbents.
now,
franks
gave
us
some
problems.
first,
franks
was
decided
against
the
background
of
a
final
determination
of
liability.
the
timeliness
and
violation
issues
had
been
finally
determined
in
favor
of
plaintiff's,
as
emphasized
in
justice
steven's
opinion
in
the
evans
case
the
next
year.
so,
arguably,
the
franks
standard
did
not
even
apply
to
our
situation.
second
problem.
what
is
unusual
adverse
impact?
well,
we
thought
the
seniority
would
affect
peoples'
ability
to
hold
their
jobs.
surely,
that
is
adverse.
arguably,
it
is
the
most
adverse
affect
an
employee
can
feel
in
a
title
vii
case.
is
it
unusual?
we
would
certainly
hope
so.
and,
thus,
we
thought
we
could
meet
the
franks
standard
even
if
it
applied.
but
our
third
problem
was
the
most
difficult.
how
do
you
prove
it?
the
standard
requires
the
union
or
the
incumbent
employees
to
present
evidence
looking
forward,
evidence
which
is
necessarily
speculative
and
conjectural.
and,
in
retrospect,
i
must
say
that
no
one
took
our
speculation
seriously.
in
fact,
the
seventh
circuit,
one
year
after
iffa's
intervention,
despite
the
fact
that
during
that
year
twa
had
furloughed
hundreds
of
flight
attendants
and
hired
none...
a
fact
of
which
the
court
was
aware...
overruled
our
arguments
in
significant
part
in
reliance
upon
previous
testimony
before
the
district
court
to
the
effect
that
this
settlement
is
no
problem,
it
will
not
affect
the
incumbents,
as
a
result
of
normal
expansion
and
attrition,
we
can
absorb
all
of
these
class
members
in
less
than
one-half
year.
unfortunately,
it
did
not
happen.
looking
back,
obviously,
our
arguments
have
more
force
than
they
had
looking
forward.
to
use
the
language
in
christiansburg,
although
we
may
have
presented
facts
that
appeared
questionable
or
unfavorable
at
the
outset,
clearly
iffa
had
an
entirely
reasonable
ground
for
bringing
its
claims.
this,
alone,
provides
a
strong
equitable
reason
for
denying
fees.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
the
more
appropriate
consideration
is
why
is
the
party
there,
what
are
its
interests,
and
does
it
have
a
legally
cognizable
right
that
is
being
affected.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
well,
i
think--
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
--well,
if
the
intervenor
is
extending...
i
don't
what
you
mean
by
deliberately...
but
if
the
intervenor
is
only
extending
the
litigation
in
order
to
have
its
claim
litigated,
i
don't
think
that's
an
equitable
basis
upon
which
to
subject
that
intervenor
to
an
almost
automatic
award
of
attorney's
fees.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
some
bad
faith
involved
or
the
intervenor
does
not
have
a
legally
cognizable
claim
that
it's
asserting,
such
as
in
the
sixth
circuit
case
in
the
haycraft
decision,
i
think
it
might
be
very
different.
i
would
also
point
out--
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
--it's
an
awfully
difficult
judgment
to
draw,
as
the
government
indicated
in
its
amicus
brief.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
perhaps
there
should
be
some
discretion,
but
i
don't
think
any
such
discretion
was
exercised
here.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
well,
that's--
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
--in
essence,
i
think
you're
posing
the
facts
of
the
charles
case
which
is
pending
on
certiorari.
and
i'm
not
sure
i
feel
competent
to
answer
it.
i
think
a
starting
point
for
this
analysis
might
be
rule
24
regarding
whether
a
party
has
a
right
to
intervene,
and
perhaps
rule
19,
whether
the
party
must
be
in
the
litigation
so
that
full
relief
may
be
accorded.
whether
in
the
situation
you
pose,
individuals
actually
have
a
cognizable
interest
and
rights
that
are
being
affected,
i
do
not
feel
qualified
to
make
that
judgment.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
i
can
see
drawing
a
distinction
between
individuals
that
have
a
right
to
intervene
and
permissive
intervention
where
an
individual
is
just
assisting
the
state,
though
that
person's
rights
are
not
affected.
if
that's
what
you're
asking,
i
think
that
would
be
a
valid
ground
on
which
to
perhaps
draw
a
distinction.
in
the
teamsters
case,
the
court
said
that
the
union
will
remain
in
the
litigation,
though
innocent
of
wrongdoing,
to
participate
in
remedial
proceedings.
this
was
a
proposition
restated
in
the
zipes
opinion
itself.
and,
indeed,
both
opinions
seemed
to
make
it
clear
that
had
iffa
not
intervened,
it
should
have
enjoined
as
a
rule
19
defendant
here.
and
i'd
like
to
consider
what
the
court
said
in
teamsters
about
title
vii
remedial--
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
--we
were
opposing
only
the
grant
of
seniority
to
the
plaintiffs
because
of
the
effect
we
believe
that
would
have
upon
our
members.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
we
sought
to
defeat
their
attempt
to
get
seniority
through
the
settlement.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
certainly.
twa--
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
--was
saying
that
the
plaintiffs
were
entitled
to
no
relief.
and
then
twa--
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
--settled--
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
--because--
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
--because
we
didn't
do
anything
wrong,
justice
white.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
and...
there's
something--
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
--but
there's
something
fundamentally
wrong
here
where
both
back
pay
and
seniority--
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
--are
ordinarily
awarded
to
successful
plaintiffs
absent
compelling
equitable
reasons
to
the
contrary.
now,
twa
got
to
take
full
advantage
of
the
weakness
of
the
plaintiffs'
claims
by
settling
for
two
cents
on
the
dollar,
while
the
incumbent
employees,
who
did
nothing
wrong,
are
paying
full
fare,
and
now
the
court
wants
them
to
pay
attorney's
fees
to
boot.
i
just
don't
think
that's
very
accurate.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
no,
we
did
not.
and,
of
course,
the
former
union
filed
the
lawsuit,
and
we
said
time
and
time
again
that
our
only
concern
was
the
seniority.
just
look
at--
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
--right.
and...
but
for
the
seniority,
we
would
have
had
no
interest,
and
we
said
that
over
and
over
again.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
well,
i
think
that's
arguable,
depending
upon
the
martin
decision
that's
pending,
if
i
understand
what's
going
on
there.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
i
haven't
really
studied
that
question,
and
there
was
really--
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
--only
because
the
union
was
a
plaintiff
in
this--
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
--instance,
it
is
different
for
plaintiffs?
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
i
suppose
that
is
arguably
true,
and
we
pointed
that
out
in
our
briefs.
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
make
sense
to
me
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
be
very
consistent
with
any
notion
of
judicial
economy
when
we
were
invited
to
come
into
this
lawsuit,
give
a
notice
of
it,
and
the
settlement
agreement
specifically
contemplates
our
intervention,
for
us
to
sit
back
and
then
try
and
do
something
later.
and,
obviously,
there
is
a
danger,
depending
upon
the
state
of
the
law,
which
may
be
clarified
soon,
that
we
would
not
have
even
been
able
to
do
that.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
i
would
certainly
agree
with
that.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
in
teamsters,
the
court
talked
about
remedial
proceedings
which
involve
imprecision
and
approximation,
and
the
delicate
task
of
adjusting
the
interest
between
the
discriminatees
and
the
legitimate
expectations
of
the
incumbents.
the
district
court
must
draw
upon
qualities
of
mercy
and
practicality.
and,
especially
when
immediate
implementation
of
an
equitable
remedy
threatens
to
impinge
upon
the
expectations
of
innocent
parties,
the
court
must
look
to
the
realities
and
necessities
inescapably
involved
in
reconciling
competing
interests
in
order
to
determine
the
special
blend
of
what
is
fair,
necessary,
and
workable.
and,
perhaps
most
interestingly,
the
court
in
teamsters
said,
that
until
evidentiary
hearings
were
held,
it
was
not
possible
to
evaluate
abstract
claims
concerning
the
equitable
balance
that
should
be
struck
in
these
proceedings.
now,
i
must
confess
that
i
do
not
know
what
all
that
means.
and
with
respect...
i'm
not
sure
that
anyone
does
know
what
that
means,
except
that
the
plaintiffs
and
the
incumbent
employees,
nearly
always
represented
by
their
unions,
are
going
to
have
to
slug
it
out
in
complex
remedial
proceedings
and
let
the
district
courts
carve
out
the
law
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
and
we
believe
that
to
say
that
the
union
must
participate
in
this
extremely
difficult
process,
where
it
cannot
possibly
be
predicted
what
claims
will
bring
about
what
results,
and
yet
to
say
the
union
shall
be
subjected
to
an
almost
automatic
award
of
attorney's
fees
if
it
should
not
prevail,
is
simply
unjust.
and
it
would
also...
it
will
also
unquestionably
cause
a
severe
chilling
effect
upon
the
rights
of
innocent
incumbent
employees
affected
as
a
collateral
consequence
of
title
vii
litigation.
we
should
also
discuss
why
it
is
the
court
said
in
teamsters
that
the
union
will
remain
for
the
remedy
phase.
it
is,
i
believe,
because
in
most
instances
it
is
only
the
union
which
is
capable
of
raising
the
rights
of
the
incumbent
employees,
for
those
claims,
most
often,
are
based
on
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
it
is
the
duty
of
the
union
to
enforce
that
agreement.
and
the
issue
is
whether
the
contract
can
be
overridden.
which
brings
us
straight
to
the
union's
duty
of
fair
representation.
now,
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
talk
about
how,
if
iffa
had
not
intervened,
a
claim
for
the
duty
of
fair
representation
against
it
might
have
been
structured
to
simply
establish
the
following.
one,
the
plaintiffs
and
defendant
obviously
thought
it
necessary
to
override
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
the
settlement
to
obtain
the
relief
they
sought.
two,
the
union
was
invited
to
participate.
three,
part
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
is
a
duty
to
enforce
rights
contained
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
four,
the
seventh
circuit
was
already
on
record
in
this
case
in
1973
lecturing
the
union
about
its
obligations
to
the
incumbents.
fifth,
you
establish
that
there
are
damages
generally
throughout
the
bargaining
unit
from
the
relief
granted.
and
justice
o'connor's
recent
opinion
in
case
87-548
establishes
that
with
its
discussion
of
how
seniority
simply
dominates
the
working
lives
of
these
flight
attendants.
and,
also,
that
the
very
job
security
of
the
junior
incumbents
was
at
stake.
and
with
hindsight,
in
this
case,
it
would
have
been
very
easy
to
do.
and,
sixth,
that
the
seventh
circuit
had
held
that
92
percent
of
these
plaintiffs
had
untimely
claims
which
were,
for
that
reason,
lacking
in
merit
and
also
lacking
in
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
and
then
the
next
question
is:
where
did
the
union's
lawyers
go
to
law
school?
don't
they
know
that
a
federal
district
court
lacking
subject
matter
jurisdiction
has
no
power
to
do
anything
but
dismiss
those
claims?
why
did
you
not
even
try
to
save
these
peoples'
jobs?
would
it
have
been
successful?
what
would
the
damages
have
been?
i
can't
say
that,
of
course.
but
i
do
know
that
a
compelling
argument
could
have
been
made
that
the
union
abused
whatever
discretionary
powers
it
had
and
arbitrarily
refused
to
process
the
seemingly
meritorious
claims
which
involved
the
very
job
security
of
its
members.
but,
of
course,
the
duty
of
fair
representation
is
not
just
a
question
of
can
the
union
be
successfully
sued?
the
union
has
an
affirmative
obligation
to
exercise
its
best
efforts
to
serve
its
members'
interests.
a
union's
raison
d'etre...
excuse
the
pronunciation...
is
to
represent,
after
all.
and
if
a
union
has
the
legal
obligation
to
ensure
that
its
members'
interests
and
rights
are
asserted,
and
if
the
courts
are
to
consider
the
interests
of
affected
innocent
incumbents,
again,
we
believe
it
is
manifestly
unjust
to
punish
a
union
by
assessing
an
automatic
award
of
attorney's
fees
against
the
union
should
it
not
prevail.
it
would,
as
the
ninth
circuit
said
in
richardson,
simply
punish
the
union
for
performing
an
act
which
it
was
under
a
legal
duty
to
do.
plaintiffs
will
argue,
of
course,
that
fee
awards
are
compensatory
and
not
punitive,
but
that
argument
bears
a
closer
analysis
for
where
innocent
bystanders
are
deprived
of
legitimate
rights
though
they
did
no
wrong,
and
where
the
courts
compound
that
injury
by
saying
that
if
you
dare
to
raise
your
voice,
you
will
be
socked
with
an
additional
award
of
attorney's
fees
to
boot,
that
award
certainly
seems
punitive
in
nature.
and,
i
would
add,
that
there
is
no
legal
basis
for
the
punishment.
indeed,
the
entire
concept
of
fee-shifting
is
rooted
in
the
principle
of
shifting
fees
to
the
party
who
violated
the
law.
even
the
private
attorney's
general
concept
is
based
upon
the
notion
that
those
private
attorneys
generally
will
prosecute
those
who
violate
the
law.
we
believe
the
fact
that
the
party
against
whom
fees
are
sought
did
not
violate
the
law,
by
itself
constitutes
a
special
circumstance
which
should
dismantle
the
presumption
of
a
fee
award
in
favor
of
prevailing
plaintiffs,
and
at
least
three
circuits
have
specifically
so
held.
our
position
is
also
very
much
in
harmony
with,
and
supported,
by
this
court's
decision
in
the
general
building
contractors
case.
i
will
not
repeat
here
the
language
from
chief
justice
rehnquist
which
we
quoted
and
discussed
in
our
brief.
but,
in
that
opinion,
the
court
also
said
that
there
are
fundamental
limitations
on
the
remedial
power
of
the
federal
courts,
that
those
powers
can
be
exercised
only
on
the
basis
of
a
violation,
and
extend
no
farther
than
required
by
that
violation.
this
principle
is
not
limited
to
civil
rights,
but
is
a
controlling
principle
governing
the
scope
of
federal
judicial
power.
the
court...
the
court
there
held
that
treating
an
innocent
party,
for
the
purposes
of
injunctive
relief,
as
if
that
party
had
been
found
liable
on
the
merits
was
beyond
the
traditional
equitable
limitations
upon
the
authority
of
federal
courts.
similarly,
here,
the
court
should
not...
we
believe
cannot...
for
attorney's
fees
purposes
treat
innocent
parties
in
the
same
fashion
as
defendants
found
guilty
of
violating
the
federal
law.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
i
do.
in
christiansburg
the
defendant
argued
that
under
the
so-called
plain
language
of
the
statute
it
was
entitled
to
fees
as
a
prevailing
defendant
under
the
same
standard
accorded
to
prevailing
plaintiffs.
the
court
rejected
that
argument.
justice
stewart
noted
that
706(k)
is
more
flexible
than
other
fee-shifting
statutes
and
said
that
decisions
under
706(k)
must
be
decided
under
traditional
considerations
of
equity
and
that
congress
entrusted
the
courts
to
do
so.
and
accordingly,
the
court
in
christiansburg
set
forth
standards
which
apply
to
plaintiffs
and
which
apply
to
defendants,
and
this
case
calls
upon
the
court
to
set
forth
standards
which
apply
to
innocent
third
parties.
we
believe
the
christiansburg
standard
which
is
applied
to
unsuccessful
plaintiffs
should
apply
to
iffa.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
i'm
not
sure
i
totally
understand
the
question--
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
--but
i
would
think--
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
--i
think--
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
--wherever
possible,
it
is
appropriate
to
shift
the
requirement
for
fees
to
the
wrongdoer,
which
is
the
party
who
injured
the
plaintiffs
and
the
party
who
injured
the
innocent
third
parties
only
slightly
less
directly.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
well,
i
think--
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
--but
twa
could
certainly
stipulate
to
facts
which
would
demonstrate
its
guilt,
and
the
union
would
be
limited
into
objecting
to
whatever
its
legally
cognizable
interests
were.
the
union
could
not
object,
and
did
not
object
here,
to
twa
paying
money
to
the
plaintiffs.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
i
suppose
so.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
sure.
we
just
think
that
where
there
is
some
question
as
to
the
validity
of
the
claims
that
it's
the
wrongdoing
party
that
should
bear
the
burden
for
fees,
and,
to
the
extent
possible,
for
the
relief
encompassed
in
the
settlement
agreement.
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
requires
the
result
here.
the
only
thing
in
the
legislative
history
about
706(k)
is
the
brief
statement
by
senator
humphrey
that
we
want
to
make
it
easier
for
plaintiffs
of
limited
means
to
bring
suit.
that
has
certainly
happened
here.
that
certainly
cannot
be
a
basis
for
finding
that
intervenors
whose
rights
are
abridged,
even
though
they
did
not
violate
the
law,
should
be
automatically
assessed
attorney's
fees.
and,
of
course,
as
you
indicated,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
is
a
problem
with
saying
the
court
exercised
discretion
because
in
case
after
case,
from
christiansburg
to
piggy
park
to
garland
to
bergeron,
the
court
has
told
the
district
courts
how
they
are
to
exercise
their
discretion.
and
if
the
fact
that
the
party
did
not
violate
the
law
is
to
be
a
factor
to
be
considered,
there
has
to
be
a
reversal
because
i
think
it
is
clear
from
both
lower
court
opinions
that
that
was
not
considered
to
be
an
appropriate
factor
here.
as
to
whether
the
union
was
a
plaintiff
or
defendant,
look
at
rule
24
which
says
a
party
who
intervenes
shall
present
a
short
pleading
presenting
either
its
claim
or
defense,
and
then
look
at
our
petition
for
intervention
in
the
joint
appendix,
and
see
whether
it
represents
a
claim
or
a
defense.
i
think
it
clearly
is
a
claim.
we
were
setting
forth
the
fact
that
we
believed
the
incumbent
employees
were
being
victimized
and
that
that
should
not
happen.
as
to
our
opposing
complete
relief,
the
only
sense
in
which
we
did
that
is
in
an
effort
to
save
the
junior
incumbents'
jobs.
we
pointed
out
to
the
district
court
that
there
had
been
a
finding
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction.
it
was
the
duty
of
the
court,
i
always
understood,
to
inquire
into
whether
he
had
subject
matter
jurisdiction
and
the
duties
of
officers
of
the
court
to
insist
in
that
endeavor.
i
take
it
mr.
hartunian
is
not
grateful
to
the
former
union
for
setting
events
in
motion
which
eventually
allowed
plaintiffs'
counsel
to
receive
the
$1.4
million
in
fees,
but
i
do
disagree
as
to
whether
the
parties
were
better
off
under
the
second
settlement
than
they
would
have
if
the
first
settlement
had
been
consummated.
and
i
have
no
quarrel
with
the
1973
seventh
circuit
opinion,
but
the
fact
is
that
the
parties
waited
an
additional
12
years
to
regain
their
jobs
and
the
average
subclass
b,
you'll
remember,
received
the
grand
sum
of
$2,000
in
back
pay.
the
average
class
member
received
just
about
the
same
seniority
she
would
have
had
if
the
first
settlement
had
been
consummated
because
of
the
limitation
upon
the
accrual
of
seniority
in
the
settlement
agreement.
it
is
true
that
the
first
settlement
required
that
the
plaintiffs
only
be
reemployed
when
openings
occurred,
as
old
the
second
settlement.
however,
the
difference
is
that
settlements
were
plentiful
in
1971
and
nonexistent
in
1979.
as
to
the
settlement
agreement...
or,
the
district
court
granting
the
seniority,
but
for
the
settlement
agreement,
obviously
the
district
court
could
not
have
granted
the
seniority
because
the
law
of
the
case
was
and
is
that
there
was
a
finding
that
subclass
b
members
had
untimely
claims.
and,
but
for
the
settlement
agreement,
he
would
not
possibly
have
been
empowered
to
issue
that
grant
of
seniority.
i
think
that's
all
i
have.
i
thank
you.
