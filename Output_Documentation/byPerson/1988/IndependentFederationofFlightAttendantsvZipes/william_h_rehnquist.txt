chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
88-608,
independent
federation
of
of
flight
attendants
v.
anne
b.
zipes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
iffa
took
no
position
on
the
claim
of
the
female
flight
attendants
against
twa
that
they'd
been
unlawfully
discriminated
against?
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
the
remedy
of
discrimination
were
found?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
fehr.
mr.
hartunian.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but,
mr.
hartunian,
certainly
the
christiansburg
decision
suggests
that
the
term
"prevailing
party"
may
be
read
one
way
in
one
case
and
another
way
in
another,
depending
on
the
circumstances.
chief
justice
rehnquist
whether
you
will
get...
the
standard
for
awarding--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--an
attorney's
fee.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
isn't...
mr.
hartunian,
isn't
there
a
provision
even
in
the
standard
cost
statute
that
costs
shall
be
awarded
as
a
matter
of
course
to
the
prevailing
party
unless
the
court
otherwise
directs?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
there's
discretion
even
in
that
area.
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you...
do
you
feel
that
the
seventh
circuit
recognized
this
as
a
matter
where
the
district
court
had
discretion
to
award
or
not
award
fees
against
the
union?
and
do
you
feel
that
the
district
court
thought
it
had
discretion?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
did
he
take...
did
the
district
court
take
into
consideration,
as
a
special
factor,
that
this
was
an
intervenor
and
not
a
defendant?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
then
you
say,
oh,
sure,
the
court
has
discretion,
but
it
should
not
make
any
special
allowance
for
the
fact
that
the
intervenor...
that
it
was
an
intervenor
here
rather
than
a
defendant,
or
that
the
intervenor
had
not
violated
the
law?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
certainly,
in
newman
v.
piggy
park,
the
court
interpreted
the
statute
somewhat
differently
than
it
was
written.
it
said
ordinarily...
in
spite
of
the
fact
the
statute
says
"may
in
its
discretion",
ordinarily
an
award
goes
to
the
prevailing
plaintiff.
now,
that
is
putting
a
gloss
on
the
literal
language
of
the
statute.
it's
controlling
the
court's
discretion
in
some
way.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
certainly
wasn't
necessarily
being
faithful
to
the
statutory
language.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
then...
okay,
then
if
the
question
of
discretion
is
always
one
in
which
this
court
sets
standards,
why
the
standard
in
piggy
park
but
not
the
standard
in
this
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
certainly...
it's
no
more
categorical
than
the
rule
in
newman
v.
piggy
park.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what...
what
if
we
tailor
that
a
little
bit
and
said,
just
like
in
newman
v.
piggy
park,
that
ordinarily
in
a
situation
like
that
you
would
not
award
a
fee
against
the
defendant?
does
that
meet
with
your
approval?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
congress
never
said
what
we
said
in
piggy
park.
chief
justice
rehnquist
congress
in
this
statute
did
not
say
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
no.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--simply
read
something
into
the
statute
that
was
not
on
the
face
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
hartunian.
mr.
fehr,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but,
yet,
the
union
could
argue,
even
if
twa
decides
not
to,
that
there's
no
violation
of
the
statute.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
there...
there,
certainly
their
equitable
position
is
regarding
an
award
of
fee...
in
that
situation...
would
be
somewhat
less
appealing
than
one
where...
which
has
not
prolonged
the
litigation
on...
on
the
merit.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
fehr.
the
case
is
submitted.
