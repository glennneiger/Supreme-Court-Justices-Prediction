justice
o'connor
mr.
fehr,
does
it
make
any
difference
under
your
equitable
theory
if
an
intervenor
comes
in
and
substantially,
by
virtue
of
the
intervention,
prolongs
the
litigation
and
delays
relief
to
the
plaintiffs
in
the
case?
should
that
be
a
consideration
in
the
ultimate
award
of
fees?
justice
o'connor
but
i
thought
you
were
urging
some
equitable
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
trial
court
in
awarding
fees.
justice
o'connor
even
if
you're
asserting
the
intervenor's
own
rights,
are
there
circumstances
which
might
justify
the
award
of
fees?
suppose
the
intervenor
has
a
legitimate
claim
but,
nonetheless,
deliberately
prolongs
and
extends
the
litigation
and
deprives
the
plaintiff
of
early
relief.
justice
o'connor
well,
maybe
it's
a
weak
claim
but
not
frivolous.
justice
o'connor
should
there
be
discretion
in
the
district
court
to
consider
those
factors?
justice
o'connor
they--
--what
if--
--excuse
me.
go
ahead.
what
if
the
intervenor
intervenes
not
to
assert
its
own
right
but,
rather,
as
is
sometimes
the
case,
for
instance,
in
a
challenge
to
a
state
criminal
statute...
intervenes
on
the
state's
side
to
defend
the
statute,
for
example,
but
not
in
its
own
right.
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
that
that
intervenor
could
be
treated
like
a
defendant
for
attorney's
fees?
justice
o'connor
well,
but
you
must
have
a
position,
i
assume,
on
my
proposition,
which
is
that
the
intervenor
is
permitted
lawfully
to
intervene
but
not
to
assert
any
right
of
its
own
as
such.
justice
o'connor
now,
presumably
you
weren't
bound
by
the
settlement
agreement?
the
union
wasn't?
the
union
could
have
sat
back,
let
the
settlement
agreement
be
entered,
and
then
challenged
it
in
a
separate
suit.
justice
o'connor
would
it
be
your
position
that
you
could
do
that?
justice
o'connor
but
what
if
that
were
the
situation
and
you
then...
the
union
filed
a
separate
suit?
presumably,
under
those
circumstances,
the
union
would
not
have
attorney's
fees
assessed
against
it
even
if
it
lost.
justice
o'connor
right.
justice
o'connor
right.
justice
o'connor
yeah,
but,
of
course,
this
court
has
read
a
limitation
into
that
statute
as
far
as
limiting
the
award
of
attorney's
fees
to
prevailing
defendants.
justice
o'connor
so,
you
can't
just
rely
on
the
literal
language
of
the
statute,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
o'connor
let
me
ask
you
this.
suppose
the
union
here
had
brought
a
separate
suit
against
the
plaintiff
class
in
twa
rather
than
intervening
in
the
ongoing
suit...
brought
its
own
separate
suit
and
eventually
lost...
there
wouldn't
have
been
attorney's
fees,
would
there?
justice
o'connor
assuming
it's
not
frivolous.
justice
o'connor
but
the
result,
in
fact,
under
existing
precedence
would
be
no
attorney's
fees
in
that
situation?
justice
o'connor
well,
let's
assume
it
could.
and
it
seems
to
me
if
it
could,
it
would
be
very
strange
to
say
that
because
they
intervened
in
the
ongoing
suit
to
get
an
earlier
resolution
of
the
claim,
that
they
wouldn't
be
treated
the
same
way.
justice
o'connor
can
you
cite
any
case
that
would
have
so
determined?
justice
o'connor
can
you
cite
any
case
that
has
interpreted
the
statute
that
way?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
hartunian,
there
is
only
one
wrongdoer
here,
isn't
there?
justice
o'connor
and
the
problem
wouldn't
have
existed
but
for
the
rules
that
twa
adopted
here.
justice
o'connor
and,
surely,
the
discretion
of
the
district
court
should
extend,
and
ordinarily
would
extend
to
take
that
into
account,
i
would
think.
justice
o'connor
well,
if
you...
if
you
reserved,
perhaps,
some
room
for
discretion
nonetheless.
but...
but
to
think
that
ordinarily
that
would
be
the
concept,
it
seems
to
me
not
to
stray
particularly
from
the
language
in
the
statute
or
from
ordinary
concepts
of
jurisprudence.
justice
o'connor
well,
but
i
would...
i
would
think
it
would
be
completely
foreseeable
by
the
employer
that
a
union
would
want
to,
or
feel
it
had
to,
defend
the
seniority
rights
of...
of
the
non-class
plaintiffs
here.
i
mean,
that...
it
just
seems
to
me
that
that--
justice
o'connor
--was
completely
foreseeable
at
the
outset.
