mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
union
and
the
government
seek
from
this
court
the
announcement
of
a
rule
forbidding
district
courts
from
imposing
attorney's
fees
under
706(k)
against
intervenors.
or,
to
put
it
another
way,
as
they
do
in
some
instances,
against
an
intervenor
who
is
innocent
of
the
violation
out
of
which
the
lawsuit
arose.
and
the
union
and
the
government
present
certain
views
that
they
think
justify
that
result
and
that
rule
because
they
think
that
these
matters
are
matters
of
sound
fairness
and
considerations
of
policy.
they're
wrong
about
that.
but,
what
is
more
important,
the
question
is
what
does
the
statute
say
because
the
issue
here
is
what
did
congress
intend.
and
we
must
start
by
examining
the
statute
to
answer
the
question
what
did
congress
intend.
there
are
three
explicit
matters
contained
in
706(k)
which
bear
on
this
question,
each
of
which
shows
that
congress
had
no
intention
to
exempt
intervenors
from
the
fee-shifting
provision,
irrespective
of
whether
the
intervenor
was
guilty
of
a
violation
of
the
law
or
not.
the
first
of
those
is
the
provision
of
prevailing
party.
congress
said
that
fees
are
authorized
to
be
awarded
to
the
prevailing
party.
there
is
no
question
that
in
this
case...
nobody
disputes
that
in
this
case
the
plaintiffs
were
the
prevailing
party.
not
only
in
the
liability
phase
of
the
case
against
twa,
but
against
the
union.
there
is
no
dispute
about
that.
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
indeed.
it
has
two
different...
the
word
"prevailing
party"
doesn't
have
any
different
meaning
whether
you're
a
plaintiff
or
a
defendant.
it's
the
implications
of
that--
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
--yes.
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
yes.
the
second
significance
of
the
phrase
"prevailing
party"
has
to
do
with
what
one
has
in
mind
when
one
contemplates
that
there
be
a
prevailing
party.
you
can
prevail
only...
in
a
lawsuit
only
when
you
prevail
against
somebody
else.
so,
for
every
time
there's
a
prevailing
party,
there's
somebody
who
lost.
and
congress
knew
that.
and
that
image
of
there
being
a
party
opposite
the
prevailing
party
is
very
important
because
the
obvious
and
logical
suggestion
is
that
the
person
who
has
to
pay
the
fees
of
the
prevailing
party
is
the
person
against
whom
the
prevailing
party
prevailed
against.
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
indeed.
and
that
is
the
second
of
the
matters
which
are...
or,
the
third
of
the
three
matters
which
i
think
are
important.
congress
did
not
make
this
fee-shifting
mandatory,
nor
did
it
prevent
it.
it
left
it
up
to
the
discretion
of
the
court.
but
i
would
like
to
proceed
to
the
next
of
the
three
items
and
then
come
back
to
the
discretion,
which
i
think
is
very
important.
the
second
is...
the
second
part
of
the
statute
that
we
think
is
very
relevant
and
bears
on
this
point
is,
the
language
of
the
statute
that
says
that
the
court
may
allow
the
prevailing
party
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
as
part
of
the
costs.
the
reason
why
that's
so
important
is
because
costs
are
awarded
to
the
winning
party
irrespective
of
whether
the
losing
party
did
something
wrong.
in
fact...
indeed...
the
statute
that
governs
the
costs
in
this
case,
28
u.s.c.
1911
and
1912,
deals
with
the
subject
of
costs
that
are
awarded
in
proceedings
in
this
court.
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
there...
we're
relying
on
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
to
the
extent
of
really
a
different
point.
and
that
is
the
question
whether
an
intervenor
should
be
carved
out
as
an
exemption.
did
congress
intend
such
a
thing?
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
there
would...
there
would
be
attorney's
fees
to
the
same
extent,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned.
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
yes,
assuming
it's
not
frivolous,
i
would
say
that
the
result
ought
to
be
not
whether
a
party
is
named
as
a
plaintiff
under
the
federal
rules
or
a
defendant
or--
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
--i
don't
think
that
the
union
could
even
bring
a
case
like
that
because
i
think
it
would
be
unfounded.
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
i
have
to
picture
such
a
case
as
involving
exactly
the
same
issues
in
exactly
the
same
kind
of
proceeding
that
we
had
in
this
case.
the
only
difference
being
that
it
was
initiated
by
them.
everything
else
was
the
same.
in
that
case,
they
should
be
imposed
with
fees
in
exactly
the
same
way
as
in
this
case
because
of
the
fact
that
the
parties
that
they
were
suing
in
this
hypothetical
second
lawsuit
are
my
clients,
the
class
members,
who
are
really
the
plaintiffs
because
they're
the
ones
upon
whom--
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
--the
statute
says
that
in
any
proceeding--
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
--i
don't
believe
that
any
case
has
ever
occurred
in
which
a
union
became
a
plaintiff
under
the
federal
rules
and
sued
some
victim
of
title
vii,
asserting
that
the
benefits
about
to
be
given
to
them
exceeded
what
the
statute
authorized.
but
the
importance
of
the
phrase
as
part
of
the
costs
is
that
costs
are
never
awarded
on
the
basis
of
a
violation
of
law.
costs
are
awarded
based
upon
who
won
and
who
lost.
and
attorneys'
fees
being
part
of
the
cost,
it's
not
determined
by
that.
and
let's
take
this
case
as
an
example.
suppose
the
union
were
to
win
this
case.
if
the
union
won
this
case,
we
would
have
to
pay
the
costs
as
a
matter
of
course.
we
didn't
violate
any
law.
so,
it's
not
the
violation
of
law
that
imposes
costs.
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
we
wouldn't
have
to
pay
fees.
that's
because
there
is
no
provision
that
authorizes
the
imposition
of
fees
upon
us
under
these
circumstances,
absolute
groundlessness.
but
the
union--
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
--well,
what...
justice
kennedy,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
statute
says
that
attorney's
fees
are
awarded
as
part
of
the
costs.
historically
the...
since
the
beginning
of
this
nation...
at
first,
attorney's
fees
were
in
some
small
measure
awarded
as
part
of
the
costs.
and
then
the
statute
eroded
to
where
costs
no
longer
included
attorney's
fees,
and
that's
what
the
american
rule...
that's
how
the
american
rule
came
about.
and,
by
this
statute,
congress
has
stuck
fees
back
into
costs.
so,
we're
back
to
a
position
in
which
we
no
longer
have
the
american
rule
to
that
extent.
and
since
costs
are
imposed
not
on
somebody
who
violated
the
law
but,
rather,
on
somebody
who
simply
should
pay
the
costs
because
he
lost,
that
means
that
whether
there
was
a
violation
of
law
is
absolutely
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
whether
these
costs
should
be
imposed
upon
the
union.
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
absolutely
there
is
discretion,
and
we
don't
say
there
is
not
discretion.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
our
argument
in
this
case
is
that
there
is
discretion,
which
is
the
third
thing
in
the
statute
that
we
find
militates
against
the
idea
of
having
a
blunderbuss
exemption
for
intervenors.
indeed,
the
statute
says
the
court
in
its
discretion
may
allow
the
prevailing
party
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee,
which
means
that
it's
up
to
the
court's
discretion
that
every
district
court
should
take
into
account
those
factors
which
should
militate
one
way
or
another.
and,
of
course,
the
discretion
is
somewhat
constrained
by...
by
the
legislative
history
as
recognized
in
christiansburg.
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
oh,
the
district
court
not
only
thought
it
had
discretion,
but
the
district
court
exercised
it.
and
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
can
find
the
district
court's
findings
in
the
appendix
to
the
certiorari
petition
at
page
35(a).
the
district
court
did
indeed
take
up
the
questions
of
how
much
delay
was
occasioned,
what
the
matters
were,
whether
they
were
relatively
meritorious,
and
so
on,
and
did
indeed
exercise
his
discretion.
he
did
not
simply
say,
whenever
the
plaintiff
wins
against
an
intervenor
you
get
attorney's
fees.
but
the--
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
--he...
no.
he
regarded
the
fact
that
the
union
is
an
intervenor
as
being
no
different
and
worthy
of
no
special
consideration.
and
in
that--
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
--that's
right.
he
should
not.
but
there
may
be
circumstances
where
because
somebody
is
an
intervenor
that
may
put
him
in
a
different
position
than
if
he
were
a
defendant.
that's
not
this
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
case
is
as
far
as
one
can
get
from
the
best
case
an
intervenor
can
present
in
order
to
show
the
special
circumstances
in
which
discretion
should
that
into
account,
because
here,
the
intervenor
acted
like
a
defendant
in
that
it
interposed
the
very
same
defense
which
had
been
the
touchstone
of
twa's
defense.
namely,
the
failure
to
file
timely
charges
and
the
assertion
that
that
was
jurisdictional.
and
so
the
union
took
as
its
main
point
of
defense
in
this
case
the
very
thing
which
not
only
the
twa
had
used
as
its
defense,
but
that
argument
which
would
have
destroyed
the
entire
case
of
the
plaintiffs,
not
just
going
to
the
question
of
remedy.
the
important
thing
here
is
that
the
government
and
the
union
seek
a
rule
that
would
forbid
district
courts
everywhere,
for
all
time,
from
imposing
a
plaintiff's
attorney's
fees
upon
an
intervenor,
and
that
sort
of
rule
simply
cannot
be
squared
with
congress'
use
of
the
word
discretion.
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
yes,
that's...
justice
scalia,
that's
right.
but
they
do
say
that
that
rule
should
be
that
whenever
an
intervenor
is
not
guilty
of
the
underlying
violation,
that
there
should
never
be
imposed
fees.
and,
of
course,
there's
no
support
for
that
in
the
statue
and
each
of
the
provisions
of
the
statute
goes
in
the
opposite
direction.
and,
the
question
of
the
legislative
history
now,
if
we
need
to
go
into
that,
also
stands
for
the
proposition
that
there
is
no
justification
for
an
exemption
like
that.
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
well,
of
course,
this
case
is
on
in
which
they
did
prolong
it.
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
i
don't
even
think
you
need
to.
it's
inherent
in
the
very
nature--
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
--of
the
fee-shifting,
statute
that
it's
only
when
fees
are
incurred
that
there
be
anything
awarded--
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
--well,
then
i
don't
see
how
a
plaintiff
could
complain
or
could...
could
ask
for
any
fee
award
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
and
i
think
the
answer
is,
yes,
i
agree
entirely.
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
i'm
trying
to
imagine
a
set
of...
i
understand
the
concept.
i'm
trying
to
imagine
a
set
of
circumstances--
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
--right.
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
i...
i
think
the
answer
to
the
question
whether
the
marginal
costs
imposed
by
an
intervenor
should
be
taken
into
account,
or
where
the
marginal
extra
costs
imposed
by
the
intervenor
are
zero,
namely
that
it
would
have
been
the
same
amount
of
effort
and
work
by
the
plaintiff
irrespective
of
the
intervenor's
presence.
i
think
that
the
answer
is
clearly
that
there
should
be
no
fees
awarded
against
the
intervenor
because
the
intervenor
did
not
cause
any
work
or
expense
to
the
plaintiff.
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
because
in
that
instance,
justice
scalia,
in
the
hypothetical
we
just
talked
about,
the
plaintiff
did
not
prevail
against
the
intervenor.
there
was
no
battle
between
the
plaintiff
and
the
intervenor
in
which
the
plaintiff
could
say,
i
prevailed
against
the
intervenor
and,
therefore,
shift
my
fees.
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
the...
the
intervenor
made
the
same
argument
that
the
defendant
did?
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
so
he
just
uttered
redundant
things?
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
well,
if
they
literally
both
occupied
the
same
position--
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
--i
might
very
well.
yes.
because
in
that
case
you
can't
blame
one...
it's
not
a
question
of
blame.
you
can't
attribute
to
the
one
any
more
than
you
can
to
the
other
the
work
that
was
imposed
upon
the
plaintiff.
because,
the
important
thing
about
this
statute
is,
that
the
congress
wanted
to
make
sure
that
the
plaintiff
would
be
equipped
with
a
lawyer.
and
in
order
to
do
that,
it
wanted
to
make
sure
that
the
fees
be
shifted
from
the
plaintiff's
shoulders
to
the
side
which
caused
those
fees
to
become
necessary.
where
you
create
a
hypothetical
in
which
you
cannot
distinguish
between
two
parties
to
the
case,
as
to
which
caused--
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
--yes.
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
because
congress
made
no
such
distinction.
that
distinction
is
completely
inapposite.
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
well,
since
the
court...
since
congress
used
the
language
it
did,
without
bringing
about
any
special
exemptions,
i
think
it
follows
from
that
that
congress
cannot
be
taken
to
have
intended
any
blunderbuss
categorical
exemption.
it
is
true
that
the...
that
congress'
choice
of
the
expression
"in
its
discretion"
allows
quite
a
bit
of
room
for
a
district
court
to
take
into
account
the
very
kinds
of
things
that
should
go
into
the
question,
a
la
christiansburg,
whether
the
costs
should
be
shifted
and
how
much.
but
i
don't
think
it's
ever
a
question
of
turning
a
plaintiff
away
simply
because
a
person
is
an
intervenor.
and
that's
exactly
what
the
union
and
the
government
seek
in
this
case.
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
in
so
doing,
this
court
was
being
faithful
to
congress'
expressed
intentions.
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
in
a
sense
it
was
because
the
question
of
discretion
is
always
one
in
which
this
court
sets
standards.
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
the
standard
being
sought
in
this
case
is
hardly
a
standard,
but
rather
a
categorical
exemption.
--that's
the--
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
--yes,
it
is.
mr.
chief
justice,
the
rule
being
sought
by
the
union
and
the
government
here
says,
if
you
identify
the
party
against
whom
fees
are
sought
as
an
intervenor
who
wasn't
guilty
of
a
violation
of
the
law,
then
you
may
never
grant
fees
to
the
plaintiff
for
the
work
made
necessary
by
that
party.
they...
in
other
words,
they
describe...
attributes,
once
described,
exempt
that
party
from
consideration--
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
--not
at
all
because
that
doesn't
meet
with
with
congress'
approval.
congress
never
said
any
such
thing.
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
yes,
they
did.
congress
did.
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
not
in
the
statute.
that's
correct.
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
but,
mr.
chief
justice,
what
congress
intended
was
very
clear,
as
was
gleaned
from...
as
piggy
park
gleaned
from
the
congressional
expression,
that
under
ordinary
circumstances
a
plaintiff
should
get
its
fees
because
of
the
underlying
congressional
purpose.
that's
clear.
and
piggy
park
did
not
torture
the
words
of
the
statute
in
order
to
arrive
at
that
conclusion.
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
i
agree
with
that.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
there
is
no
call...
no
cause
to
read
into
this
statute
what
the
union
and
the
government
seek
to
read
into
it,
like
there
was
in
the
case
of
piggy
park.
because
piggy--
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
--that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
yes.
twa.
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
in
order
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
the
entire
lawsuit
was
made
necessary
only
because
of
the
wrong
of
twa,
and
laying
the
blame
at
twa's
feet
for
everything
that
happened
thereafter,
has
some
logical
appeal
to
it.
however,
any
rule
which
caused
the
shifting
of
fees
only
to
the
original
wrongdoing
defendant
would
have
some
very
untoward
effects,
which
we
describe
in
part
four
of
our
brief.
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
justice
o'connor,
it
makes
sense
to
require
a
defendant
to
pay
a
plaintiff's
fees
for
all
of
the
litigation
that
a
defendant
can
reasonably
anticipate
at
the
moment
it
commits
the
wrong.
and
so,
in
the
case
in
this
setting...
the
typical
title
vii
case...
you
might
easily
attribute
to
the
defendant
the
reasonable
anticipation
that
there
will
be
not
only
litigation
about
liability
but
about
relief.
but
the
only
kind
of
litigation
that
you
can
attribute
to
a
defendant
in
this
case
would
be
that
over
unusual
adverse
impact
a
la
franks
v.
bowman.
and
although
the
union
would
have
you
believe
that's
what
the
litigation
was
about
here,
this--
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
--i
agree
with
that.
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
i
agree
with
that.
but
i
don't
think
you
can
expect
that
twa
would
have
looked
forward
to
and
expect
that
the
union
would
come
in
and
make
arguments
about
the
question
of
jurisdiction,
or
that
the
union
would
make
arguments
that
had
become
oeclasse
six
years
earlier
in
franks
v.
bowman.
what
the
union
came
and
argued
in
this
case...
and
what
they
argued
is
clear
from
the
zipes
opinion...
it's
not
what
the
union
says
they
argued.
they
did
not
argue
unusual
adverse
impact.
they
spent
two
minutes
on
that.
what
they
argued,
and
the
two
things
clear
from
zipes,
are
the
jurisdictional
question...
and
you
can't
expect
twa
to
look
forward
to
that
once
twa
dropped
that
cudgel.
and,
second,
it
argued
as
though
franks
v.
bowman
had
never
been
decided.
argued
that,
gee,
this
is
going
to
have
an
impact
on
us.
well,
of
course,
it
will.
it's
an
unusual
adverse
impact
that
counts.
not
just
some
impact.
seniority
is
important,
and
it's
as
important
to
the
incumbents
as
it
was...
and
to
the
victims...
as
it
was
to
the
incumbents.
so,
when
the
union
argues
that
what
it
did
was
reasonable
under
these
circumstances,
they're
really
missing
the
point.
and
the
question
whether
the
defendant
should
be
imposed...
whether
the
fee
should
be
imposed
on
the
defendant
i
think
should
go
to
the
question
of
foreseeability,
which
is
inapposite
to
this
case
because
of
the
particular
facts
of
this
case.
and
the
particular
facts
of
this
case
are
important
with
respect
to
this
question
of
discretion
and
forsee
ability
to
the
defendant.
the
union
filed
this
case
originally
in
1970
at
a
time
when
the
union
contract
was
about
to
expire,
and
one
of
the
things
the
union
wanted
for
its
incumbents
was
to
end
twa's
no-mothers
policy.
they
filed
this
lawsuit
to
bring
pressure
on
twa,
but
filed
it
not
only
on
behalf
of
the
incumbents
in
order
to
try
and
stop
a
practice
from
continuing...
which,
of
course,
the
incumbents
had
an
interest
in...
but
filed
to
as
the
purported
class
representative
on
behalf
of
all
previously
fired
stewardesses,
stewardesses
who
were
no
longer
members
of
the
union.
and,
the
complaint
prayed...
among
its
prayers
to
relief
was
back
pay.
the
way
the
union
settled
the
case
with
twa
was
they
eliminated
the
policy
for
the
future
and
got
virtually
nothing
for
the
class
members
whose
claims
they
had
used
in
the
bargaining
process.
so,
they
brought
the
threat
of
back
pay
claims
and
the
other
kinds
of
equitable
relief
that
the
prior
stewardesses
might
have
enjoyed,
used
that
as
a
threat.
once
they
got
what
they
wanted,
virtually
abandoned
the
class
members
in
a
settlement
in
which
the
class
members
would...
the
previous
stewardesses
would
have
gotten
no
back
pay,
would
not
even
have
had
a
right
to
get
their
jobs
back
except
as
openings
occurred,
and
would
get
not
only
no
retroactive
competitive
seniority,
but,
to
the
delight
of
twa,
no
retroactive
company
seniority.
and
it
was
with
that,
and
the
fact
that,
as
the
seventh
circuit
noted,
that
they
didn't...
they
being
twa
and
the
union...
did
not
even
give
the
right
to
opt
out
to
the
previously-fired
stewardesses.
they
wanted
to
run
this
settlement
through
in
a
way
so
that
there
wasn't
even
any
opt-out
provision.
that's
why
the
seventh
circuit
vacated
the
order
approving
that
settlement
and
remanded
with
instructions
to
remove
the
union
as
a
class
representative.
and
then
the
union
was
not
heard
from
again
until
five
or
six
years
later,
1979,
when
after
we
had
obtained
summary
judgment
and
we
had
brought
twa
to
the
bargaining
table
while
cross-petitions
for
certiorari
were--
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
--could
we
have?
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
we
had
no...
we
had
no
complaint
against
the
union,
justice
white.
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
oh,
we...
oh,
justice
white,
when
the
settlement
was
entered
into...
and,
by
the
way,
the
settlement
did
not
purport
to
give
any
retroactive
seniority--
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
--we
invited...
we
went
before
the
court
and
said
as
we--
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
--yes.
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
well,
i
don't
see
where
the
distinction
is
important.
the
important
thing
was
to
get
them
the
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
the
question
of
unusual
adverse
impact
because
that's
what
this
court
said
is
required
in
franks
v.
bowman.
so,
whether
we
made
them
a
party...
we
simply
went
before
the
court--
mr.
aram
a.
hartunian
--if
we
had
thought
it
necessary...
and
we
didn't...
we
would
have
served
them
with
a
summons
and
made
them
a
defendant.
yes.
as
it
was,
it
didn't
become
necessary
because
we
invited
them.
the
court...
we
suggested
that
the
court
invite
them,
and
they
were
invited,
and
they
declined
the
invitation.
instead,
filed
a
full-blown
petition
to
intervene
so
that
they
could
get
the
rights,
i
suppose,
of
the
intervenor.
i
don't
see
what
distinction
they
obtained.
in
any
event,
with
that
record,
with
that
history
of
the
litigation,
the
union
can
hardly
complain
that
it
was
mistreated
in
the
case
or
take
credit
for
anything
that
it
did
for
the
plaintiffs.
i
do
also
want
to
mention
that
the
settlement
agreement
did
not,
as
the
union
would
have
you
believe,
give
away
the
rights
of
retroactive
seniority.
the
settlement
agreement
was
absolutely
neutral
on
it.
the
settlement
agreement
said
that
twa
would
take
no
position
on
it,
that
whatever
the
plaintiffs'
petitioned
for,
it
would
be
up
to
the
court,
and
if
any
interested
party
comes
before
the
court,
that
twa
will
stand
aside.
all
of
that
is
in
the
joint
appendix
at
pages
13
and
27
to
28.
this
court
announced
in
alyeska
that
it
is
not
up
to
this
court
to
reallocate
the
burdens
of
litigation
in
the
absence
of
legislative
guidance.
here,
there
has
been
legislative
guidance.
and,
the
same
thing
that
was
said
in
alyeska
can
be
said
here
with
a
corollary
to
it,
being
that
where
congress
has
allocated
the
burdens
of
litigation,
it
is
not
for
this
court
to
take
into
account
so-called
policy
or
equitable
matters
to
change
what
congress
has
clearly
done
or
to
insert
things
that
congress
left
out.
