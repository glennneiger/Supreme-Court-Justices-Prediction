justice
o'connor
mr.
kneedler,
the
adjudicative
agency
proceeding
that
is
being
considered
here
for
purposes
of
attorney's
fees
is
one
that
occurred
on
remand
as
a
result
of
the
civil
litigation.
is
that
correct?
justice
o'connor
and
i
take
it
there
is
no
final
judgment
for
purposes
of
determining
the
attorney's
fees
under
eaja
until
the
district
court
finally
enters
the
judgment
at
the
conclusion
of
the
proceedings
on
remand?
justice
o'connor
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
yes?
justice
o'connor
but
for
purposes
of
awarding
fees,
am
i
correct?
justice
o'connor
well,
why...
why
isn't
it
the
case
then
that
the
court
in
the
civil
action
retains
jurisdiction
and
why
isn't
this
remand
proceeding
in
essence
part
of
the
civil
action?
i
think
that
point
troubles
me
most.
justice
o'connor
oh,
and
presumably
to
make
sure
that
the
proceedings
on
remand
were
in
accordance
with
the
court's
view
of
the
overall
relief
that
should
be
granted.
justice
o'connor
yes,
but
it's
very
easy
to
consider
this
thing
as
just
part
of
the
civil
action.
justice
o'connor
well,
certainly
her
attorney
was
needed
on
remand
to
accomplish
the
ultimate
goal
of
the
litigation.
justice
o'connor
mr.
coleman,
the
court
below
relied
instead
on
the
agency
adversary
adjudication
section.
but
you
don't
seem
to
be
defending
that
now.
you
are
urging
us
to
affirm,
but
on
a
different
ground,
that
it
is
part
of
the
civil
action.
is
that
basically
right?
justice
o'connor
so,
you
agree
essentially
with
mr.
kneedler,
then,
that
the
united
states
was
not
represented
otherwise
within
the
meaning
of
the
adversary
adjudication
provision
before
the
agency?
justice
o'connor
and
how
do
you
respond
to
the
language
in
the
house
report
that
is
cited
on
page
26
of
the
government's
opening
brief?
