how
come
you
can
say
the
united
states
doesn't
take
a
position
in
passing
on
the
claim?
justice
white
and
you
don't
think...
you
don't
think
in
denying
a
claim
the
united
states
has
taken
a
position?
justice
white
and
so
the
proceeding
really
isn't
adversary
unless
the
united
states
is
separately
represented?
justice
white
well,
there
is
no
claim
in
this
case
for
a
fee
on
the
initial
administrative
proceeding.
justice
white
well,
really...
really,
the
claimant
is
in
a
much
stronger
position.
the
united
states'
position,
if
it
ever
had
one,
had
been
overruled.
justice
white
so,
the
result
is
preordained.
justice
white
well,
it's
close.
[laughter]
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
well,
the
claimant
has
got
a
judgment
too.
justice
white
if
the
government
had
given
up
after
the...
after
the
decision
on
appeal
and
just
paid
the
claim,
they
could
have
done
that.
justice
white
and
there
would
have
been
a
final
judgment.
justice
white
well,
there
was
a
final
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
law.
justice
white
was
entitled
to
benefits.
justice
white
a
court
of
appeals
judgment
doesn't
have
to
be
a
final
judgment.
justice
white
i
mean,
it's
appealable.
they
can
seek
cert
from
a
court
of
appeals
judgment.
justice
white
do
you
think
it's
critical
that
we
consider
the
proceedings
that
went
on
after
remand
to
be
part
of
the
judicial
proceedings?
justice
white
or
are
you...
i
understood
your
brief
to
say
that
once
the
government
has
ever
taken
a
legal
position,
then
any
administrative
proceeding
that
occurs
after
that,
whether
the
government
is
represented
or
not,
is...
is
subject
to
a
fee
award.
that's...
that's
the
alternative
ground
that
we
argue.
and
that
is
the...
that's
the
ground
on
which
the
eleventh
circuit
awarded
fees
in
this
case,
which
was,
the
eleventh
circuit
determined
that
the
remand
proceedings
were
proceedings
in
which
the
government
had
taken
a
position
because
of
its
relationship
to
the
civil
case.
but
you
are
defending
that
decision
on
that
ground,
i
guess.
justice
white
but
you
think
you
have
a
better
ground?
justice
white
well,
that's
sort
of
an
argument
that
the
judicial
proceedings
are
part
of
the
administrative
proceeding.
