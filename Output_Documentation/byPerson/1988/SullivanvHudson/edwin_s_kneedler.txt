mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
a
social
security
claimant
has
a
right
under
the
equal
access
to
justice
act
to
recover
from
the
united
states
the
attorney's
fees
and
expenses
she
incurred
in
administrative
proceedings
following
a
remand
from
a
federal
district
court.
before
summarizing
the
facts
in
this
case,
i
will
briefly
describe
the
two
provisions
of
each
of
the
equal
access
to
justice
act
that
have
been
discussed
in
connection
with
the
fee
award
in
this
case.
eaja
waives
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states
to
fees
and
expenses
in
certain
circumstances
specified
in
the
act
itself.
eaja
contains
two
basic
provisions,
one
applicable
to
administrative
proceedings,
the
other
to
judicial
proceedings.
the
provision
of
eaja
applicable
to
administrative
proceedings
is
contained
in
section
504
of
title
5
of
the
united
states
code.
it
provides
that
an
agency
that
conducts
what
the
act
refers
to
as
an
adversary
adjudication
shall
award
to
the
prevailing
party
in
such
an
adjudication
the
fees
and
expenses
that
were
incurred
unless
the
adjudicative
officer
of
the
agency
finds
that
the
position
of
the
united
states
was
substantially
justified
or
special
circumstances
would
make
an
award
unjust.
the
term
adversary
adjudication
is
precisely
defined
in
eaja
to
mean
circumstances
in
which
the
position
of
the
government
is
represented
by
counsel
or
otherwise
in
the
adjudication.
the
other
provision
of
eaja
concerning
the
award
of
attorney's
fees
and
expenses
in
court
is
contained
in
section
2412(d)
of
title
28.
it
authorizes
a
court
to
award
a
prevailing
party
fees
and
expenses
incurred
by
that
party
"in
any
civil
action,
including
proceedings
for
judicial
review
of
agency
action,
brought
by
or
against
the
united
states
in
any
court
having
jurisdiction
of
the
action.
"
it
is
the
position
of
the
united
states
in
this
case
that
neither
of
these
provisions
of
eaja
waives
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states
to
the
award
of
fees
and
expenses
on
remand
in
this
case.
section
504
is
inapplicable
because
administrative
proceedings
under
the
social
security
act
are
non-adversarial.
the
government
does
not
take
a
position
in
those
hearings
and
is
not
represented
by
counsel
or
otherwise
in
them.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
model
rules
promulgated
by
the
administrative
conference
of
the
united
states
and
followed
by
federal
agencies,
including
hhs,
have
given
content
to
that.
those
model
rules
defined
"represented
by
counsel
or
otherwise"
to
refer
to
situations
in
which
there
is
another
sort
of
representative,
such
as
a
paralegal,
who
might
represent
the
government
in
the
proceedings.
the
model
rules
define
the
phrase
"represented
by
counsel
or
otherwise"
to
refer
to
situations
in
which
the
position
of
the
united
states
is
presented
by
an
attorney
or
other
representative
who
enters
an
appearance
and
then
actually
participates
in
the
administrative
proceedings.
the
administrative
conference
was
given
authority
to
coordinate
the
implementation
of
eaja
in
the
administrative
context
under
section
504(c)(1)
of
the
act,
and
these
model
rules
were
in
effect...
were
promulgated
in
1981
and
have
been
in
effect
ever
since,
and
were
in
effect
when
congress
reenacted
eaja
in
1985.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i'm
informed,
for
example,
as
particularly
relevant
here,
the
legislative
history
of
the
1985
reenactment
refers
to
a
special
experimental
program
set
up
by
hhs
in
the
social
security
context
in
five
regional
offices
whereby
the
agency
was
represented
in
alj
hearings.
i'm
informed
that
in
a
number
of
occasions
in
those
hearings
non-lawyers
appeared
to
represent
the
government
in
those
proceedings.
these
were
program
officers
who
were
very
familiar
with
the
way
in
which
the
social
security
program
operated
but
were
not
lawyers.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
there
is
no
advocate
for
the
government,
from
the
perspective
of
the
government
seeking
to
deny
a
claim
in
an
administrative
hearing.
the
only
government
official,
the
only
ssa
official,
present
at
a
hearing
is
the
alj.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
suppose
that
the
alj
as
a
judicial
officer
could
be
said
to
be
rendering
a
decision
that
the
claimant
is
not
entitled.
but
eaja
refers
to
the...
to
advocacy
before
the
decision-maker.
the
advocates
for
the
claimant,
and
if
there
should
be
one
for
the
government.
someone
advocating
that
the
claim
should
be
denied.
the
alj
does
not,
as
this
court
recognized
in
richardson
v.
perales,
does
not
act
as
an
advocate
or
an
adversary.
the
alj
is
an
adjudicator.
and,
in
fact,
under
governing
regulations,
the
administrative
law
judge
has
an
obligation
to
inquire
fully
into
all
the
circumstances
and
facts
of
the
case.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
through
a
lawyer
or
otherwise.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's...
that's
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--a
final
judgment
for
purposes
of
awarding
the
fees.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
not
a
final
judgment
for
purposes
of
appeal.
we
believe
the
remand
order
was
appealable
at
the
time
that
it
was
sent
back
to
the
secretary.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
but
that's
only
for
fees
in
the
judicial
proceedings.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
okay.
two
separate
answers.
the
district
court
can
retain
jurisdiction
for
purposes
of
awarding
attorney's
fees.
but
the...
when
the
claimant
first
seeks
judicial
review,
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
the
secretary's
decision
denying
the
claim
for
benefits
is
correct
or
not.
in
this
case,
the
district
court
affirmed
the
secretary's
decision,
but
the
eleventh
circuit
reversed
and
said
the
secretary
should...
and
remanded
back
to
the
secretary
to
consider
other
circumstances.
when
the
case
was
sent
back
to
the
secretary,
the
district
court's
review
of
that
decision
was
completed.
the
court
of
appeals
had
concluded
that
that
decision
was
erroneous.
the
district
court
could
retain
jurisdiction
for
purposes
of
awarding
fees
if
the
claimant
should
ultimately
prevail
on
remand.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
the
way
the
procedure
operates
is
that
when
the
case
goes
back
to
the
agency...
for
example,
what
happened
in
this
case.
the
appeals
council
receives
the
remand
from
the
court
and
then
the
appeals
council,
in
this
case,
vacated
its
prior
decision
denying
the
claim
for
benefits.
from
that
point
on
there
was
no
outstanding
position
of
the
agency
that
respondent
should
be
denied
benefits.
and
then
there
was
the...
the
appeals
council
ordered
a
hearing.
there
was
no
representative
of
the
government
at
that
hearing.
the
government
did
not
take
a
position
before
the
appeals
council
or
the
alj.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
both
eaja
and
the
social
security
act
clearly
distinguish
between
civil
actions
and
proceedings
before
the
secretary.
eaja
itself
carefully
divides
the
circumstances
for
the
award
of
attorney's
fees
into
two
categories.
one
under
section
504
for
fees
performed
for
services
before
an
agency.
that's
only
when
the
proceedings
are
an
adversary
adjudication.
section
2412
governs...
requires
that
the
fees
be
incurred
in
the
civil
action
in
court.
now,
a
remand
proceeding
is
not
part
of
the
civil
action.
the
social
security
act
itself
divides
the
responsibilities
in
a
directly
parallel
fashion
between
the
agency
and
the
court.
under
title
ii,
for
example,
section
405(b)
specifically
directs
the
secretary
to
conduct
hearings
and
to
find
facts.
section
405(b)
applies
both
in
the
initial
hearings
and
on
any
hearings
on
remand.
the
same
standards,
the
same
procedures
apply,
and
they
are
non-adversarial
in
the
same
way
as
before.
section
405(g),
on
the
other
hand,
is
the
provision
of
the
social
security
act
that
deals
with
judicial
review,
and
it
deals
with
the
responsibilities
of
the
court,
not
the
secretary.
in
fact,
405(g)
uses
the
same
phrase,
civil
action,
that
eaja
does.
so,
the
attorney's
fees
that
are
authorized
under
section
2412
under
eaja
in
a
civil
action
are
only
those
fees
incurred
in
the
action
for
a
judicial
review.
if
the
court
concludes
that
the
case
should
go
back
to
the
secretary,
it
is
then
returning
the
matter
back
to
the
officer
of
the
government
having
primary
and
distinct
responsibility
for
the
claim,
which
is
the
secretary
of
hhs.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
latter.
there
was
no
specific
reservation
of
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
that's
essentially
correct.
and
the
proceedings
back
before
the
agency
then
are
within
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
agency
and,
therefore,
within
the
ambit
of
section
504
and
fees
can
be
awarded
only
if
section
504
applies
to
them.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
suppose
that
could
happen.
there
have
been...
there
have
been
district
court
decisions
under
the
social
security
act
where
the
court
sends
the
case
back
to
the
agency
and
purports
to
retain
jurisdiction.
i
mean,
in
particular
for
the
award
of
attorney's
fees.
but
i
think
that
doesn't
render
the
court's
review
non-final,
as
is
true
in
an
appeal
under
1291
if
there
is
still
an
outstanding
attorney
fee
question,
as
there
might
be
here.
that
doesn't
render
the
court's
review
non-final.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
not.
and,
in
fact,
i
think
when
you
read
section
405(g)
closely...
and
we
discuss
this
at
the
conclusion
of
our
reply
brief...
section
405(g)
makes
it
pretty
clear
that
that's
not
supposed
to
happen
here.
section
405(g)
addresses
the
question
of
remands
in
circumstances
such
as
this
where
the
court
reverses
the
secretary's
decision
on
the
merits
and
sends
it
back
to
the
agency
for
what
the
statute
refers
to
as
a
rehearing
under
what
the
court
regarded
to
be
the
proper
standards.
section
405(g)
provides
that
that's
a
judgment,
when
the
court
reverses
the
secretary's
decision
and
sends
it
back
for
a
rehearing.
that
is
a
judgment
even
though
there
will
be
further
proceedings
before
the
agency.
and
section
405(g)...
sentence
eight
of
section
405(g)
in
fact
designates
that
as
a
final
judgment.
so,
it
seems
to
us
to
be
particularly
clear
under
section
405(g)
that
the
court's
reviewing
job
is
completed
when
the
case
is
sent
back
to
the
secretary.
and
at
that
point,
once
the
appeals
council
vacates
its
prior
decision
denying
the
claim
for
benefits,
the
claimant
is
back
exactly
where
she
was
during
the
time
of
her
first
hearing.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
first
of
all,
in
this
case
it's
not
at
all
clear
that
an
attorney
was
required
because
it's
particularly
vivid
that
the
proceedings
on
remand
in
this
case
were
non-adversarial.
not
only
did
the
appeals
council
vacate
the
alj's
prior
decision,
but
the
appeals
council
took
note
of
the
fact
that
after
the
time
the
alj
rendered
her
decision
the
first
time
around
congress
had
ordered
the
secretary
to
revise
the
standards
for
mental
impairments.
the
appeals
council
ordered
the
alj
to
review
respondent's
case
under
the
new
standards
and
suggested
that
the
alj
receive
the
advise
of
a
medical
advisor.
all
of
those
are
clearly
non-adversarial
undertakings
by
the
government,
and
in
fact
were
for
the
benefit
of
the
claimant.
and
it
was
in
response
to
those
actions
taken
by
the
appeals
council
on
its
own
that
respondent
was
awarded
benefits.
so,
it
seems
to
us
to
be
particularly
vivid
in
this
case
that
the
proceedings
were
non-adversarial.
the
only...
the
only
thing
that
counsel
did
in
this
case
that
respondent
has
pointed
to
is
to
correct
the
typographical
error
at
the
conclusion
of
the
alj's
decision
identifying
the
onset
date
of
the
period
of
disability
as
may
15th,
1982
rather
than
1981.
but
it
was
perfectly
evident
from
the
prior
portions
of
the
alj's
decision
that
that
was
an
error,
and
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
the
appeals
council
would
have
overlooked
that
onset
date
on
its
own.
but,
more
importantly,
that
error
was
not
in
any
way
due
to
adversarial
representation
by
the
government.
once
again,
whatever
one
might
think
should
be
the
proper
rule
here,
congress
has
specified
that
before
an
agency,
fees
may
be
awarded
only
when
the
agency
proceedings
themselves
satisfy
the
statutory
definition
of
being
an
adversary
adjudication.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
no.
2412(d)(3)
refers
to
circumstances
in
which
a
court
may
award
fees
for
services
performed
before
the
agency;
2412(d)(1)(a)
is
the
section
that
provides
for
fees
awarded
in
the
judicial
proceedings
themselves.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
well,
in
our
brief
we
add
2412(d)(1)(a).
this
is
on
page
2
of
our
brief.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
2412(d)(3)
is
significant
in
our
view
because
it
is
a
provision
of
the
act
that
specifically
addresses
the
circumstances
in
which
a
court
may
award
fees...
in
which
a
court
may
award
fees
for
services
performed
before
an
agency.
and
2412(d)(3)
is
specifically
limited
to
those
cases
in
which
the
party
seeks
judicial
review
of
an
adversary
adjudication.
in
other
words,
the
only
case
in
which
a
court
may
award
fees
for
work
done
before
an
agency,
the
very
relief
that
respondent
seeks
in
this
case,
is,
once
again,
when
the
agency
itself
has
conducted
an
adversary
adjudication
in
which
the
agency
is
represented
by
counsel.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
if
there
had
been
an
attorney
present
in
the
experimental
program?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
non-attorneys.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
there
is
a
separate
threshold
question
which
we
identify
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief.
and
that
is
whether...
the
definition
of
adversary
adjudication
is
not
only
where
the
government
is
represented
by
counsel,
but
also
another
requirement
is
that
the
adjudication
be
undertaken
under
section
554
of
title
5,
which
is
the
apa.
and
it's
been
the
position
of
the
government
for
many
years
that
the
apa
does
not
apply
of
its
own
force
to
social
security
proceedings.
and
this
court
left
that
question
open
in
richardson
v.
perales.
so,
there
is
that
threshold
question.
but
here
there
is
no
need
to
reach
that
because
we
think
it's
so
clear
from
the
statutory
text
that
absent
the
sort
of
experimental
program
to
which
you're
referring
these
are
simply
not
adversary
proceedings
because
the
government
doesn't
take
a
position
before
the
alj
on
the
claim,
and
what's
more,
it
does
not
appear
through
counsel
or
other
representative.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
at
least
for
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
but
i
believe
there
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
believe
there
is
separate
statutory
authorization
for
the
use
of
administrative
law
judges
in
social
security
programs.
congress
converted
prior
hearing
examiners
under
title
16.
i'm
not
sure
about
title
2.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
they
terminated
when
the
case
was
remanded
back
to
the
secretary.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
it
was
part
of
the
judicial
proceedings
only
for
purposes
of
the
award
of--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--attorney's
fees.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
for
all
purposes,
including
attorney's
fees,
it
terminated
when
the
fees
were
awarded.
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
proceedings
on
remand,
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
not...
not
carved
out.
they're
just
separately
dealt
with
under
both
the
eaja
and
the
social
security
act.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
but...
but
it...
there's
no
suggestion
whatever
in
the
text
or
legislative
history
of
this
act
that
proceedings
on
remand
before
the
agency
are
somehow
part
of
the
civil
action
in
court.
congress,
again,
quite
separately
dealt
with
the
two
different
types
of
proceedings.
and,
again,
in
the
administrative
proceedings,
the
purposes
that
congress
was
trying
to
serve
by
making
attorney's
fees
available
in
certain
adversary
adjudications,
again,
demonstrate
why
attorney's
fees
should
not
be
available.
and
congress
didn't
contemplate
that
they
would
be
in
proceedings
on
remand.
what
congress
was
trying
to
do,
as
the
word
equal
access
to
justice
suggests,
was
to
level
the
playing
field.
where
the
government
is
represented
by
a
lawyer
in
an
administrative
proceeding,
or
other
representative,
congress
determined
that
attorney's
fees
should
be
available
for
the
claimant
in
appropriate
circumstances.
and
by
the
same
token,
the
legislative
history
of
the
1980
act
makes
it
particularly
clear
that
it
would
be
unfair
to
award
the...
to
require
the
government
to
pay
for
the
claimant's
attorney
when
the
government
itself
wasn't
represented
by
an
attorney.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's...
that's
correct.
but
the
same
rule...
the
same
rule
applies
to
the
proceedings
on
remand
because
they...
because
those
proceedings
on
remand
are
governed
by
exactly
the
same
regulations,
the
same
standards.
and,
in
fact,
after
the
remand,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
the
claimant
is
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
she
was
in
before.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
whatever...
whatever--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it's
not
preordained
because--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
court...
the
court
may
have...
the
court
may
have
disagreed
with
the
secretary
on
certain
legal
issues--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--as
was
true
here
in
considering
several
impairments.
but
the
court
sends
it
back
to
the
alj
for
a
fresh
adjudication
under
the
correct
legal
standards.
and
then
the
parties
start
all
over
again,
with
the
government
not
represented
by
counsel.
and
the
purposes
of
the
act
that
are
reflected
both
in
the
statement
of
purposes
in
section
202
of
eaja,
plus
the
legislative
history,
indicate
that
congress
didn't
intend
the
fees
to
be
available
there
because
there
is
no
disparate...
if
there
is
any
disparity
in
the
representation,
it's
in
favor
of
the
claimant
since
the
claimant
has
a
lawyer
and
the
government
does
not.
and
it
would,
in
the
judgment
of
congress
in
1980,
be
unfair
to
require
the
government
to
pay
the
claimant's
attorney's
fees
when
the
government
itself
is
not
represented
by
counsel.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
claimant
has
a
judgment
and
the
issues
have
been
narrowed
on
remand.
as
this
case
demonstrates,
the
adjudication
on
remand
was
facilitated.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
they
are,
but
that's
no
different
from
the
fact
that
the
alj
has
to
conduct
the
hearing
under
certain
legal
rules
at--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
no
one
is
suggesting
that.
but
a
lawyer
would
have
the
same
sort
of
duty
in
an
initial
proceeding
before
the
case
had
ever
gotten
to
court
to
make
sure
that
the
alj
obeyed
whatever
legal
standards
governed
that
proceeding.
whether
it
be
regulations
or
a
prior
court
of
appeals
decision
that
didn't
apply
to
the
claimant's
case.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
figures
that
the
social
security
administration
gave
me
is
that
in
about
65
percent
of
hearings
the
claimant
is
represented
by
counsel,
and
about
another
18
percent
represented
by
some
other
form
of
representative
other
than
counsel.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
claims
that
go
to
hearings,
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
before
an
alj.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
before
the
alj,
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
a
lot
of
them
are
not
represented
by
counsel--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--in
that.
again,
respondent
bases
her
entire
submission
in
this
case
on
a
supposed
distinction
between
administrative
proceedings
that
precede
judicial
review
and
proceedings
on
remand
from
the
court.
but,
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
and
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
that
draws
such
a
distinction
or
furnishes
any
statutory
or
textual
basis
for
the
award
of
a
claim.
administrative
proceedings
before
the
secretary
are
just
that,
whether
they're
in
the
initial
proceedings
or
on
remand.
but
if
there
were
any
question
about
it,
i
would
like
to
refer
the
court's
attention
to
the
legislative
history
on
page
26
of
our
opening
brief,
where
congress
was
specifically
addressing
the
question
of
the
award
of
attorney's
fees
in
the
context
of
where
a
case
is
remanded
by
the
district
court
back
to
the
secretary.
congress
was
there
discussing,
in
the
indented
quote,
the
arrangements
that
certain
courts
had
made
to
provide
for
the
award
of
attorney's
fees
in
those
cases
before--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
the...
when
a
case
is
sent
back
to
the
secretary,
the
claimant
is
not
yet
a
prevailing
party
and
so
the
arrangement
several
courts
arrived
at
was
that
the
district
court
could
retain
jurisdiction
over
the
attorney's
fee
question
to
see
whether
the
claimant
prevailed
on
remand.
if
she
did,
then
the
court
could
award
fees
for
what
occurred
in
the
judicial
proceedings.
but,
as
the
italicized
sentence
says,
as
the
courts
have
found,
the
only
fees
which
will
be
available
will
be
for
those
activities
undertaken
in
connection
with
the
initial
or
judicial
proceedings,
and
not
those
associated
with
the
administrative
proceeding.
and
since
this
quotation
was
in
the
specific
context
of
remands,
we
think
it's
quite
clear
from
the
legislative
history
that
congress
intended
the
text
of
the
act
to
mean
what
it
said.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
there
were
judicial
decisions
to
that
effect
and
congress
ratified
those
when
it
passed
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
that's
just
to
determine
whether
he's
a
prevailing
party
for
fees
in
the
judicial
proceedings
themselves.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is...
what
happens
on
remand
is
not
part
of
the
judicial
proceeding.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
respondent's
primary
submission
here
is
that
the
proceedings
before
the
agency
on
remand
are
somehow
part
of
the
judicial
proceeding.
first
of
all,
we
think
that
stretches
the
common
sense
notion
of
what
a
civil
action
is
beyond
recognition.
but
there
is
not...
there
is
not
a
need
to
focus
just
on
the
word
"civil
action"
here.
the
whole
structure
of
eaja
is
to
treat
administrative
proceedings
separately
from
judicial
proceedings.
when
a
case
is
remanded
back
to
the
agency,
they
are,
again,
agency,
or
administrative
proceedings--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--not
judicial
proceedings.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
it
would
not.
the
legislative
history
on
page
26
of
our
brief
that
we
cite
discusses--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
there--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--is
the
statutory
phrase
"prevailing
party".
the
person
may
have
prevailed
on
one
issue,
but
until
you
know
whether
he
prevails
in
any
substantial
way
in
terms
of
his
entitlement--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
he
has
filed
a
claim
for
benefits
and
he
hasn't
prevailed
on
his
claim
for
benefits.
and
the
legislative
history
on
page
26...
i'm
sorry
to
refer
to
it,
but
it's
discussing
cases
that
have
construed
the
language
"prevailing
party",
and
congress
is
essentially
saying,
"we
agree
with
those
cases
that
give
meaning
to
prevailing
party
as
not
including
the
situation
where
the
party
simply
prevails
in
one
legal
issue
in
the
case
and
gets
sent
back
to
the
agency.
"
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
it's
not.
because
it's
a
condition
subsequent
to
the
entitlement
to
benefits
for
the
judicial
proceedings.
that
the
person
not
only
prevail
on
his
legal
issue,
but
also
prevail
on
his
overall
claim
for
benefits.
section
2412(d)(1)(a)
itself
distinguishes
between
judicial
and
administrative
proceedings,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
focus
on
that
language.
it
refers
to
the
authorization
for
a
court
to
award
fees
in
any
civil
action,
including
proceedings
for
judicial
review
of
agency
action.
what's
encompassed
in
the
term
"civil
action"
is
only
the
judicial
review
of
the
agency
action.
the
agency
action
is
something
else.
and
when
a
case
gets
remanded
back
to
the
secretary,
in
this
case
the
secretary
vacated
the
first
administrative
decision
denying
the
claim,
held
further
proceedings,
and
then
entered
a
new
decision
on
the
remand.
that
new
decision
on
remand
was
agency
action,
taken
by
the
secretary
pursuant
to
statutory
authority.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
congress,
in
our
view,
did
precisely
that
because
the
administrative
proceedings
are
separately
dealt
with
in
section
504,
and
the
word
"prevailing"
carries
two
meanings
here.
prevailing
on
the
particular
issue
in
court
and
on
the
overall
claim
for
benefits.
and,
as
i
said,
it's
a
condition
subsequent,
that
you
not
only
have
to
prevail
on
the
legal
issue
the
first
time
around
in
court,
but
also
have
to
prevail
on
the
claim
for
benefits
in
the
main
to
be
entitled
to
benefits.
also,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
in
section
405(g),
it
does
not
require
that
the
record
get
sent
back
to
the
court
in
all
proceedings
as
if
the
secretary
were
just
a
special
master
for
the
court.
the
provision
for
certifying
the
record
back
to
the
court
is
only
in
a
narrow
sort
of
pre-judgment
remand
by
the
court
where
the
case
gets
sent
back
to
the
secretary
to
receive
new
evidence.
and,
far
from
making
the
secretary
an
agent
of
the
court
in
those
circumstances,
that
provision
for
sending
it
back
to
the
secretary
demonstrates
that
the
secretary
is
a
separate
entity,
not
part
of
the
court.
