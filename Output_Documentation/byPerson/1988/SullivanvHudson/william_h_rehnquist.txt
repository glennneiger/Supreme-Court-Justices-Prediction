we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
88-616,
louis
w.
sullivan,
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
v.
elmer
hudson.
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
kneedler,
what
does
the
phrase
"or
otherwise"
mean?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
coleman.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--mr.
coleman--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--mr.
coleman,
are
you
paraphrasing
now
the
language
of
a
house
report
or
are
you
quoting
directly?
chief
justice
rehnquist
no,
i
was
just
curious.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
were
paraphrasing.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
the
district
court
doesn't
make
the
initial
determination
of
whether
she's
entitled
to
benefits.
that's
for
the
secretary,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
what's
the
standard
of
review
in
the
district
court?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
use
the
term
"limited
remand".
are
you
suggesting
that
there
are
some
remands
involved
in
social
security
cases
which
are
not
limited
remands?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
would
be
an
example
of
one
of
those?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
in
your
first
example
of
the
unlimited
remand...
there,
would
the
decision
of
the
secretary
have
been
final
on
remand?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
coleman.
mr.
kneedler,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
kneedler--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
the
case
is
submitted.
