justice
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
could
i
interrupt
to
get
your
help
on
one
part
of
the
2412(d)(3).
the
government
agrees,
does
it
not,
that
there
are
fees
payable
for
the
proceedings
in
court?
justice
stevens
but
those
proceedings,
under
the
statute,
had
to
be
judicial
review
of
an
adversary
adjudication,
did
they
not?
justice
stevens
oh,
i
see.
because
in
your
brief...
or,
your
petition,
rather...
you
quoted
2412(d)(3).
but
you
really
should
have
quoted
2412(d)(1).
justice
stevens
oh,
i
see.
justice
stevens
although
the
government
does
use
aljs
in
all
those
proceedings,
it's
not
confident
enough
about
its
position
on
that
point
that
it
doesn't
decline
to
use
aljs
who
are
usable
only
for
554
proceedings.
justice
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
going
back
to
the
text...
and
i
thank
you
for
calling
my
attention
to
the
right
provision
on
page
2
of
your
brief...
2412(d)(1)(a),
including
proceedings
for
a
judicial
review
of
agency
action.
in
the
government's
submission,
when
did
the
proceedings
for
judicial
review
of
the
agency
action
in
this
case
terminate?
justice
stevens
and
the...
and
the
filing
the
order
later
on
and
getting
fees
for
the
work
during
the
judicial,
that
was
not
part
of
the
judicial
proceeding?
justice
stevens
well--
justice
stevens
--when
did
they
terminate
for
all
purposes?
justice
stevens
which
was
after
the
remand
proceedings
had
taken
place?
justice
stevens
but
you
say
that
part
of
the
proceeding
is
kind
of
carved
out
because
it
was
before
the
agency
rather
than
before
a
court?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
well,
that's
the
issue,
i
guess.
justice
stevens
but
the
way
the
issues
have
been
narrowed
is
they
have
to...
further
proceedings
have
to
be
in
accordance
with
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
district
court.
so,
there
is...
you've
got
a
little
different
set
of
ground-rules.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
the
difference,
i
suppose,
is
that
the...
i
think
if
you
were
a
lawyer
representing
a
client
in
that
position,
you'd
really
have
a
professional
duty
to
be
sure
that
the
standards
that
you
fought
for
in
the
litigation
were
carried
out
and
were
interpreted
properly.
justice
stevens
it's
kind
of
strange
for
the
lawyer
to
just
go
home
and
sit
around.
justice
stevens
but
are
the
claimants
in
all
these
proceedings,
these
vast
number
of
proceedings,
in
the
initial
stages
typically
represented
by
counsel?
justice
stevens
those
are
in
claims
that
go
to
hearing,
of
course.
justice
stevens
before
an
alj?
justice
stevens
so
there
would
be
an
awful
lot
of
them
denied
before
that,
or
granted
before
that,
and
i
suppose
that
in
most
of
those
there
probably
would
not
be
counsel.
those
that
are
just
processed
at
the
administrative
level.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
let
me
just
make
sure
i
understand
one
other
thing,
mr.
kneedler,
about
the
scheme.
supposing
the
claimant
wins
in
the
judicial
proceeding
in
the
sense
that
he
or
she
gets
a
new
hearing
but
ultimately
does
not
get
any
money
out
of
the
case
because
on
remand
they
decide
the
claim
is
no
good
for
some
other
reason;
that
person
is
not
a
prevailing
party
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
justice
stevens
so
that
the
status
of
the
claimant
as
a
prevailing
party
in
the
last
analysis
depends
on
what
happens
in
the
administrative
proceedings
on
remand?
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
that
is
not
part
of
the
judicial
proceeding
in
which--
justice
stevens
--in
which
they
become
a
prevailing
party.
okay.
justice
stevens
mr.
coleman,
may
i
interrupt
you
because
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
part
of
your
argument?
you
say
there
are
two
kinds
of
proceedings.
one
where
there
is
a
threshold
legal
objection
that
is
sustained
by
the
secretary,
and
no
facts.
and
the
other,
the
case
like
this.
in
the
threshold
legal
determination
kind
of
case,
supposing
you
went
on
appeal
and
the
court
says,
go
ahead
and
have
a
full
hearing.
do
you
take
the
position
that
before
that
hearing
you
would
become
a
prevailing
party?
justice
stevens
but
now
would
the
district
judge
be
allowed
to
give
you
that
award
of
fees
without
waiting
to
see
if
you
prevail
at
the
actual
hearing?
justice
stevens
but
then,
conversely,
you
are
agreeing
with
the
government,
i
guess,
that
in
that
sort
of
case
you
would
not
be
entitled
to
fees
in
the
remand
proceedings
before
the
agency?
justice
stevens
and
then
one
other
question.
do
you
think
all
of
these
cases
fall
neatly
into
one
or
the
other
of
these
two
categories?
justice
stevens
--would
you
respond
to
justice
scalia's
question
about...
would
it
be
open
to
this
court,
given
the
statutory
scheme,
to
hold
that
your
opponent
became
a
prevailing
party
when
the
case
was
remanded?
justice
stevens
say,
if
we
don't...
if
we
don't
look
at
legislative
history,
as
some
of
us
don't
like
to,
and
just
looked
at
the
text
of
the
statute.
is
there
anything
that
would
prohibit
us
from
doing
that?
justice
stevens
you
say--
justice
stevens
--but
he's
prevailed
on
the
only
issue
that
was
adjudicated
in
the
judicial
proceeding.
