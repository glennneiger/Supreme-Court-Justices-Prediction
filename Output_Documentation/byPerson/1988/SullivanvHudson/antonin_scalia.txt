justice
scalia
has
that
ever
happened,
mr.
kneedler?
i'm
unfamiliar
with
proceedings
where
there
is
somebody
representing
the
government
who
is
not
counsel?
what
kind
of
proceedings
would
they
be?
justice
scalia
mr.
kneedler,
did
the
eleventh
circuit
here,
when
it
remanded
to
the
agency,
make
any
special
statement
saying
this
court
is
retaining
jurisdiction
over
this
case,
or
is
whatever
retention
of
jurisdiction
it
had
simply
the
normal
retention
of
jurisdiction
that
occurs
by
operation
of
law,
if
any?
justice
scalia
so
this
is
no
different
from
a
court
of
appeals,
let's
say
the
d.c.
circuit
remanding
an
agency
rulemaking,
reversing
the
rule
and
remanding
for
further
proceedings
before
the
agency?
justice
scalia
are
there...
are
there
any
instances
to
your
knowledge...
i
seem
to
recollect
some...
in
which
a
court
doesn't
just
remand,
but
remands
with
some
special
indication
that
it
intends
to
oversee
further
developments
in
the
case?
justice
scalia
do
you
think
courts
can
retain
jurisdiction
and
in
effect
have
the
executive
branch
operate
under
the
court's
supervision
thereafter?
justice
scalia
if
it
was
not
a
554
proceeding,
you
could
have
any
agency
officer
conduct
the
hearing,
right?
justice
scalia
and
the
government
always
uses
aljs.
justice
scalia
so,
this
was
a
house
committee
discussing
it?
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
but
the
act
does
not
provide
compensation
in
that
situation
so
long
as
there
is
no
attorney.
it's
clear
that
for
the
initial
social
security
determination,
even
though
the
alj
who
is
an
employee
of
the
agency
and
a
government
official,
wrongly
decides
against
an
applicant...
arbitrarily
takes
an
unreasonable
position...
there
would
be
no
fees
available
for
that--
justice
scalia
--well,
but
doesn't
that
cast
some
doubt
on...
on
what
you're
saying?
justice
scalia
how
do
we
know
that
was
a
typographical
error
in
the
house
report?
justice
scalia
oh.
that
proves
that
it
was
a
typographical
error?
justice
scalia
or,
at
least,
the
later
house
committee
thought
it
should
have
been
"judicial".
justice
scalia
the
same
committee--
justice
scalia
--later?
justice
scalia
uh-huh.
justice
scalia
mr.
coleman,
can
i
ask
you
about
the...
what
seems
to
me
to
be
the
logical
basis
for
your
case
is
that
everything
that
happens
until
the
judicial
proceeding
is
terminated,
is
part
of
the
judicial
proceeding.
since
the
case
was
not
over
until
the
remanded
proceedings
were
completed,
everything
that
occurred
had
to
be
part
of
the
judicial
proceeding.
but
it
seems
to
me
those
are
two
different
questions:
when
the
proceeding
ends
and
what
constitutes
part
of
the
proceeding
while
it
is
still
continuing.
when
we
remand
something
to
a
lower
court
or
when
a
court
of
appeals
remands
something
to
the
district
court,
you
may
well
say...
and
explicitly
says,
"we
retain
jurisdiction"
or
something
of
that
sort...
you
may
well
say
that
the
case
doesn't
end
until
it's
completed
below.
but
you
would
not
say
that
the
proceedings
below
are
part
of
the
court
of
appeals
proceeding.
that
seems
to
me
a
very
strange
way
to
think.
and
that's
what
you're
saying
here.
you're
saying
the
proceedings
below
are
part
of
the
judicial
proceeding.
they're
not.
they
haven't
been
completed
yet,
but
that
doesn't
make
them
part
of
the
judicial
proceeding.
justice
scalia
mr.
coleman,
i'm
a
little
troubled
by
the
consequences
of
the
rule
that
you're
urging
for
as
far
as
the
governmental
fiske
is
concerned.
let's
assume
a
lot
of
social
security
attorneys
realize
that
the
agency
has
been
taking
a
position
that
things
in
combination
don't
count,
that
it
has
to
be
individually.
they
figure
this
is
wrong
on
the
law
and
they
figure
they
can
win
that
on
an
appeal.
even
those
who
have
clients
who...
even
though
they
know
that
their
clients
can't
prove
a
disability
even
in
combination,
those
attorneys
could
bring
a
suit
on
behalf
of
those
clients
before
the
social
security
administration,
lose
there,
go
up
on
appeal,
win
on
appeal
on
the
issue
of
law,
get
remanded
to
the
agency.
fight
before
the
agency
on
the
issue
of
fact,
whether
there
is
any
disability
even
in
combination,
on
the
issue
of
fact
that
they
know
they
can't
win
on.
and
then
they
can
go
home
with
attorney's
fees
for
both
their
work
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
their
work
before
the
agency.
wouldn't
they
be
able
to?
justice
scalia
you
acknowledge
that
they
have
to
win
when
they
get
back?
justice
scalia
couldn't
happen.
justice
scalia
could
the
government,
in
your
view
of
the
thing,
have
taken
an
appeal
on
the
merits
from
the
court
of
appeals
immediately
without--
justice
scalia
--going
through
the
remand?
justice
scalia
mr.
coleman,
all
of
this
argument
has
assumed
that
you
can't
get
fees
just
from
the
court...
just
for
the
court
proceeding
until
you
get
your
award.
have
we
said
anything
that
makes
that
clear?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me...
let's
assume
the
government
takes
on
the
appeal,
on
your
appeal,
a
position
that
is
not
substantially
justified.
and
you
win
the
appeal,
ever
though
you
later
lose
back
in
the
court.
the
government
has
still
made
you
jump
over
a
lot
of
obstacles
that
you
shouldn't
have
had
to
jump
over.
have
we
ever
said
whether...
whether
you
can
get
your
court
attorney's
fees?
justice
scalia
well,
how
we
come
out
in
this
case
very
much
depends
on
how
we
would
come
out
in
the
other
one,
doesn't
it?
i
mean,
if
we
were
to
say
that
you
are
entitled
to
your
attorney's
fees
in
the
court
right
away,
as
soon
as
you
won
the
appeal,
then
there
would
be
less
reason
to
say
that
you're
entitled
to
attorney's
fees
back
at
the
agency,
wouldn't
there?
justice
scalia
well,
the
appeal
wouldn't
be
over.
the
appeal
wouldn't
be
over.
you
wouldn't
have
to
await
the
remand
in
order
to
determine
whether
you
could
award
attorney's
fees.
justice
scalia
it
would
make
it
a
lot
weaker.
justice
scalia
i
agree
with
all
that.
but
somebody
who
talks
that
way,
when
he
says
"prevailing
party"
probably
means
prevailing
party
in
the
separate
civil
action.
i
mean,
you
ask
us
to
regard
them
as
separate
for
one
purpose
and
not
to
regard
them
as
separate
for
another
purpose.
