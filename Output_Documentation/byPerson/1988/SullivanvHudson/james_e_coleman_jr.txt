mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
kneedler
referred
to
the
purpose
of
the
equal
access
to
justice
act
as
leveling
the
playing
field.
but
there
is
another
equally
important
purpose
of
the
act,
and
that
was
to
shift
to
the
federal
government
the
cost
of
litigation
caused
by
a
federal
agency
or
official
that
took
a
position
against
a
person
such
as
mrs.
hudson
without
substantial
justification.
in
this
case,
the
government
does
not
contest
that
the
position
it
took
in
1982
when
it
initially
denied
the
benefits
to
mrs.
hudson
was
without
substantial
justification.
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
that's
correct,
and
we
don't
dispute
that
at
all.
i--
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
--no.
because
the
equal
access
to
justice
act
is
really
two
statutes.
one
statute
is
a
provision
in
which
the
government
is
permitted
to
pay
attorney's
fees
in
adversarial
adjudicatory
proceedings.
and
we
don't
contest
that.
the
second
part
of
the
act
is
where
the
government
is
involved
in
civil
proceedings,
in
court
proceedings,
and
takes
a
position
that's
not
substantially
justified.
fees
are
also
available
in
that
circumstance.
and
it's
our
position
in
this
case
that
it
is
title
28
that
governs,
and
not
title
5.
there
is
no
dispute
in
terms
of
what
happens
in
the
initial
proceedings.
that
the
government
can
take
any
position
it
likes.
it
can
be
arbitrary,
it
can
protract
the
proceedings,
and
when
the
secretary
makes
a
final
decision
the
claimant
is
not
entitled
to
attorney
fees.
but,
what
the
act
says
is,
that
if
there
is
a
civil
action
initiated
to
review
that,
the
government
gets
only
one
chance
to
do
that.
it's
already
had
its
chance
in
a
case
such
as
this.
then
we
have
a
civil
proceeding
and
we
never
go
back
to
the
administrative
proceedings
that
are
governed
by
section
504
of
title
5.
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
well,
not
exactly
because
our
position
is
that
section
504
is
not
relevant
to
the
remand
proceedings.
if
it
is
relevant,
if
this
court
determines
that
section
504
and
section
2412
together...
determine
whether
a
fee
is
awarded
in
a
case
to
review
a
decision
of
the
secretary,
then
the
eleventh
circuit's
decision
would
be
correct
and
we
would
defend
it
on
that
basis.
but,
in
our
view,
the
way
in
which
the
statute
was
enacted
makes
it
very
clear
that
the
administrative
proceedings
are
what
precedes
the
judicial
review,
and
that
after
the
final
agency
decision
in
the
administrative
proceedings,
the
only
thing
that
you
have
left
is
a
judicial
proceeding.
and
that's
true
whether
it
was
an
adversarial
proceeding
below
or
whether
it
was
a
non-adversarial
proceeding.
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
that
report
is
cited...
first
of
all,
it's
edited
in
the
government's
brief
in
a
way
that
distorts
the
meaning.
for
example,
the
portion
of
the
report
that
is
emphasized
in
the
government's
brief
refers
to
"as
the
courts"
and
they
replace
"these"
with
"the".
this
sentence
referred
to
cases
that
were
cited
in
the
brown
v.
secretary
of
hew
case
which
they
deleted
right
before
the
sentence
that
they
emphasized.
in
brown,
the
court
noted
that
there
were
a
number
of
decisions
in
which
courts
had
awarded
fees
for
obtaining
a
remand,
without
waiting
to
see
what
happened
in
the
remand
proceedings.
and
what
the
congressional
report,
what
the
house
report
says,
is
that
as
these
courts
found
in
those
cases
where
the
remand
proceedings
had
not
even
occurred...
and
none
of
the
cases
reflect
what
happened
on
remand...
that
the
judges
awarded
fees
for
the
judicial
portion
leading
up
to
the
remand
but
not
for
the
administrative
proceedings,
which--
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
--can
only
refer
to
the
administrative
proceedings
that--
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
--came
first.
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
well,
i
can
quote
it
directly.
i
was--
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
--i
was
paraphrasing.
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
i
was
paraphrasing.
but
what
the
government
also
did
in
its
brief
was
to...
there
was
a
typographical
error
in
the
original
house
report
which
said
"initial".
it
should
have
been
"judicial".
and
that
was
corrected
in
a
supplemental
report.
but,
because
it
said
i.e.,
judicial
proceedings>
["]
when
in
fact
all
it
referred
to
were
the
judicial
proceedings
that
led
to
the
remand,
and
not...
it
did
not
intend
to
indicate
any
relationship
in
time
between
the
administrative
proceedings
and
the
judicial
proceedings.
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
we...
we
cite
in
our
brief
the
supplemental
house
report
which
makes
the
correction.
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
well,
i
assume
what
it
proves
is
that
the
initial
word...
that
the
word
"initial"
was
intended
to
be
judicial.
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
no,
it
was...
i'm
sorry...
it
was
the
same
committee.
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
it
was
a
supplemental--
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
--yes.
it
was
simply
issued
a
few
weeks,
i
think,
later.
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
section
504
of
title--
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
--well,
that
is
what
we're
saying,
but
i
don't
think
the
analogy
with
what
happens
when
this
court
or
a
court
of
appeals
remands
a
case.
there
are
some
circumstances
where
there
is
a
limited
remand
by
a
court
of
appeals,
for
example,
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
retains
jurisdiction
in
order
to
enter
an
order
pending
further
proceedings
in
the
district
court.
that
is
more
analogous.
but
in
this
case,
section
405
of
the
social
security
act
itself
makes
the
remand
proceedings
a
part
of
the
judicial
proceedings
because
the
secretary
does
not
have
the
authority
in
the
remand
proceedings
to
issue
a
final
decision
that
would
terminate
the
proceedings.
it's
very
clear.
and
the
government
took
the
position
in
this
case
and
has
taken
the
position
in
all
of
these
cases.
and
that
also
is
reflected
in
the
house
report
that
the
government
cites
on
page
26,
that
a
remand,
a
limited
remand
in
a
social
security
case
is
for
the
purpose
of
the
secretary
to
take
some
action
in
accordance
with
the
court's
decision.
the
secretary
then
files
the
transcript,
to
the
extent
that
there
was
a
transcript
developed
in
the
remand
proceedings,
plus
any
new
decision
or
modified
decision
that
the
secretary
makes
on
the
basis
of
the
remand
proceedings.
all
of
that
is
then
filed
in
the
federal
district
court,
and
the
district
court
then,
upon
review
of
that,
issues
a
final
decision...
the
final
decision...
either
affirming,
reversing,
or
modifying.
what
happened
in
this
court
and
what
the
eleventh
circuit
did...
what
happened
in
this
case
and
what
the
eleventh
circuit
did
was
to
say
that
in
the
initial
proceedings,
which
we
acknowledge...
we
concede...
mrs.
hudson
was
not
entitled
to
claim
attorney's
fees
for.
but
in
those
proceedings
the
government
took
a
position
that
was
contrary
to
its
regulations,
which
was
that
mrs.
hudson
suffered
from
various
impairments,
none
of
which
taken
alone
was
sufficient
to
render
her
disabled.
but
the
eleventh
circuit
had
decided
in
a
number
of
cases,
going
back
to
1980,
that
in
a
situation
like
that,
the
agency
is
to
consider
the
impairments
in
combination.
and
that's
what
the
agency
failed
to
do
in
this
case,
and
it
litigated
that
position
in
the
judicial
action
to
review
its
decision.
the
eleventh
circuit
said...
you
should
have
done
it
that
way,
now
do
it
that
way.
and
then
under
405
you
file
the
transcript
and
any
decision,
and
the
district
court
enters
the
final
judgment.
the--
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
--that's
not
the
case.
and
that's
a
very
significant
point
because
in
order
to
obtain
attorney
fees
in
these
cases,
the
claimant
must
receive
benefits.
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
yes.
and
that
is
why
it
is
important
that
the
remand
proceedings
be
considered
a
part
of
the
judicial
proceeding.
because
in
order
to
get
attorney
fees
under
2412
the
claimant
must
win
in
the
remand
proceedings
or
must
establish
a
record
that
will
permit
him
or
her
to
win
in
the
judicial
proceedings.
so,
the
case
that
you
suggest
would--
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
--not
result
in
attorney's
fees.
section
504
of
title
5...
i
think
by
its
terms
it's
clear
that
it
was
intended
to
deal
with
administrative
proceedings
that
occurred
prior
to
judicial
review
and
that
were
concluded
prior
to
judicial
review.
there
are
three
provisions
of
section
504,
i
think,
that
are
relevant
in
that
respect.
first,
the
party
must
prevail
in
the
adversary
adjudication,
and
that's
section
504(a).
second,
the
fee
sought
must
be
sought
within
30
days
of
a
final
disposition
in
the
adversary
adjudication.
then,
finally,
section
504(c)
provides
that
if
there
is
judicial
review
sought
of
the
final
decision
following
the
adversary
adjudication,
then
fees
can
be
awarded
only
by
the
court
that
reviews
the
final
action.
that
is
section
504(c),
and
fees
in
that
case
would
be
awarded
under
section
2412(d)(3).
there
is
no
other
circumstance,
even
in
section
504,
where
the
agency
makes
a
final
decision,
a
final
determination,
and
then
that
is
reviewed
by
a
court
in
which
you
go
back
to
the
agency
to
recover
fees.
the
notion
is
that
the
action
is
terminated
on
judicial
review
for
purposes
of
the
administrative
proceeding
as
well.
in
this...
in
this
case,
the
government
for
the
first
time
in
its
reply
brief
takes
the
position
that
the...
that
the
judicial
proceeding
terminated
with
the
remand
order.
that
is
contrary
to
the
position
that
it
took
earlier
in
the
case
and
is
contrary
to
the
position
that
it
has
taken
in
all
of
these
cases.
and,
it's
contrary
to
the
house
report
that
specifically
referred
to
cases
decided
in
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
third
circuit
dealing
with
this
issue.
the
remand
proceedings...
first
of
all,
in
order
to
recover
attorney
fees
the
party
must
prevail.
in
other
words,
in
a
social
security
case,
the
party
must
obtain
benefits.
that
happens
only
after
the
remand
proceedings
have
been
concluded
and
the
findings
of
the
secretary
and
a
decision
is
filed
back
with
the
court
which
has
jurisdiction
under
section
405(g)
to
enter
the
final
order.
in
addition,
the
30-day
time
period
for
filing
the
application
begins
to
run
from
the
time
of
a
final
judgment.
and
the
cases
have
consistently
interpreted
that
requirement
to
mean
the
time
that
the
district
court
enters
an
order
terminating
the
proceeding,
the
judicial
proceeding.
in
the
section
of
the
legislative
history
cited
by
the
government
at
page
26
of
its
brief
that
talks
about
remand
proceedings,
first
of
all,
it's
important
to
note
that
that
section
of
the
legislative
history
dealt
only
with
whether
or
not
fees
would
be
available
at
the
point
that
a
remand
order
is
obtained,
as
opposed
to
whether
they
are
available
as
cases
have
held
following
the
receipt
of
benefits
on
remand.
but
in
that
section
of
the
legislative
history,
the
house
report
says
that
the
remand
decision
is
not
a
final
judgment
nor
is
the
agency
decision
after
remand.
instead,
the
district
court
should
enter
an
order
affirming,
modifying,
or
reversing
the
final
agency
decision,
and
this
will
usually
be
the
final
judgment
that
starts
your
30
days
for
filing
the
eaja
petition.
that
is
the
position
that
the
government
has
taken
throughout
in
this
case
until
the
reply
brief.
for
the
first
time
in
the
reply
brief
the
government
suggests
that
the
final
judgment
in
this
case
came
at
the
time
that
a
remand
order
issued,
as
opposed
to
the
time,
december
1,
1987,
when
the
district
court
entered
an
order
dismissing
this
case
but
retaining
jurisdiction
to
entertain
a
petition
for
attorney
fees.
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
they
could
have
done
that.
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
there
would
have
been
a
final
judgment
in
that
instance
and
we
wouldn't
have
this
case.
and
that
is
the...
that
is
the
point
of
the--
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
--that's
correct.
but
what
the
court
of
appeals
finally
determined...
the
effect
of
the
secretary's
regulations.
and
that
was
final.
but
what
the
eleventh
circuit
did
not
finally
determine
was
whether
or
not
the
respondent
was
entitled
to--
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
--benefits.
and
that
was
the
point
of
the
complaint
in
the
first
instance,
was
to
reverse
the
secretary's
decision
that
she
was
not
disabled
and
not
entitled
to
benefits.
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
i'm
not--
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
--i'm
not
sure
that
the
government
could
have.
in
other
words,
whether
the
government
could
have
sought
cert
in
this
court
following
the
decision
in
the
eleventh
circuit...
i'm
not
sure
whether
the
government
could
have
done
that
from
the
eleventh
circuit.
but
i
don't
think--
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
--yes.
i'm--
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
--that's
correct.
and
that's
why
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
relevant
to
this
issue.
because
at
that
point,
just
as
they
did
here
where
the
eleventh
circuit
determined
that
the
government's
position
had
been
without
substantial
justification
and
remanded
to
the
district
court,
the
government
sought
cert
in
this
case.
and
so
the
civil
case,
obviously,
continues
in
that
circumstance.
the
remand
would
then
have
waited
until
this
court
either
denied
cert
or
granted
cert
and
reviewed
and
issued
a
decision.
so,
there
is
no
circumstance
where
if
an
appeal
had
been
taken,
the
remand
proceedings
would
have
gone
on
simultaneously.
this
court...
or,
at
least
justice
brennan
in
a
concurrent
opinion
in
the
case
of
webb
v.
dyer
county
board
of
educations
referred
in
interpreting
section
1988
of
title
42
of
the
u.s.
code...
referred
to
an
analogous
situation
in
which
the
district
court
in
a
civil
rights
case
abstains
in
order
to
permit
the
parties
to
litigate
a
state
law
issue
in
a
civil
rights
action.
and
then,
once
the
state
law
issue
is
litigated,
then
the
district
court
proceeds
with
a
determination
of
the
civil
rights
claim.
justice
brennan
referred
to
that
as
a
taking
the
ancillary
proceedings
and
making
them
a
part
of
the
civil
rights
litigation
for
purposes
of
section
1988.
i
think
that
what
happened
in
this
case
is
analogous
to
that
situation
where
the
remand
proceedings
were
for
purposes
of
establishing
a
record
on
which
the
district
court
could
then
make
a
determination
of
whether
mrs.
hudson
was
entitled
to
benefits
whether
or
not
the
secretary
issued
a
decision
that
she
was.
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
whether
or
not
it's
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
and
that's
also...
that
also
is
the
standard
with
respect
to
what
happens
in
the
remand
proceedings
as
well.
but
the
remand
proceedings
are
limited
remand
proceedings
only
for
the
purpose
of
the
secretary
taking
an
action
that
she
should
have
taken
in
the
initial
proceedings.
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
yes.
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
for
example,
where
the
secretary
makes
a
ruling
of
law
that
terminates
the
proceeding
prior
to
a
final
decision.
in
other
words,
terminates
it
and
says
that
the
claimant,
for
example,
does
not
qualify
under
the
statute
without
regard
to
what
the
facts
are.
that
is
litigated;
the
secretary
has
reversed.
then
that
would
terminate
the
judicial
review.
the
proceedings
would
then
resume
before
the
secretary
to
a
conclusion.
but
that's
not
what
happened
in
this
case.
in
this
case
there
was
a
final
decision
by
the
secretary.
the
administrative
proceedings
went
through
to
their
conclusion.
and
the
only
thing
that
happened
following
the
eleventh
circuit's
decision
was
that
the
court
decided
that
the
secretary
had
failed
without
substantial
justification
to
consider
the
impairments
in
combination.
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
it
would
be
a...
it
would
be
a
final
decision,
but
it
would
not
be
a
final
decision
with
respect
to
the
claim
that
the
claimant
is
disabled.
the
secretary
doesn't
reach
that
decision
because
she
rules
on
an
issue
of
law
that
she
doesn't
have
to
reach
that
decision.
if
she's
wrong
about
that,
i
think
that
the
party
who
seeks
judicial
review
is
the
prevailing
party
under
the
equal
access
to
justice
act,
and
the
administrative
proceeding
simply
continues.
in
this
case,
the
remand
was
solely
for
the
purpose
of
the
secretary
considering
the
impairments
in
combination.
that's
reflected
in
the
recommended
decision
of
the
administrative
law
judge
on
remand,
which
is
a
part
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
cert
in
this
case,
beginning
at
page
21
of
the
appendix.
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
i
think
so,
because
the
relief
that
you...
the
relief
that
you
sought--
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
--yes.
and
that
has
been
done.
that
was
one
of
the
decisions
that
was
cited
in
the
brown
v.
secretary
of
hew
case
cited
in
the
house
report.
one
of
the
cases
involved
just
that,
where
the
administrative
proceedings
were
terminated
because
the
secretary
determined
that
the
claimant
had
not
met
a
requirement
for
seeking
an
appeal
to
the
appeals
council.
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
that's
correct
because
the
remand
proceeding
then
is
simply
a
continuation
of
the
one
that
had
begun
but
in
which
the
secretary
had
not
reached
a
final
decision
on
the
question
of
whether
the
person
was
disabled.
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
i
think
that
they
probably
fall
neatly
within
one
or
the
other.
i
think
that
there
may
be
some
circumstances
where...
in
the
instance
that
i've
just
described,
where
there's
sort
of
an
interlocutory
appeal
or
interlocutory
review
in
federal
court
under...
in
an
administrative
proceeding
that
would
be
governed
by
section
504
where
the
remand
proceedings
would
continue
and
they
would
be
governed
by
section
504.
it's
simply
that
the
two
ends
would
be
put
together.
in
this
case,
what
the
government,
by
its
position,
is
attempting
to
do
is
to
carve
out
the
remand
proceedings
and
treat
them
as
if
they
sort
of
exist
out
in
space
independently
of
anything.
the
remand
proceedings
exist
only
for
purposes
of
the
further
consideration
ordered
by
the
district
court
to
permit
the
district
court
to
issue
a
final
judgment
in
the
case.
and
that's
without
regard
to
the
equal
access
to
justice
act.
that's
the
purpose
of
it.
it
simply
is
a
part
of
the
judicial
proceedings
that
the
district
court
has
ordered
in
order
to
give
the
secretary
an
opportunity
first
to,
as
in
this
case,
consider
the
impairments
in
combination.
once
that
was
done,
then
the
judicial
proceedings
will
continue.
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
well,
it's--
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
--well,
we
think
the--
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
--that's
correct.
we
think
the
better
ground
is
to
view
the
remand
proceedings
as
part
of
the
civil
action
and...
and
not
have
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
504
applies
at
all.
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
this...
this
court
has
not
addressed
the
question
of
at
what
point
do
you
become
a
prevailing
party
in
a
social
security
case.
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
well,
there
wouldn't
be
less
reason.
that
portion
of
the
fees
are
not
in
dispute
in
any
event.
the
government
doesn't
contest
that
for
the
work
done
to
obtain
the
remand
order
we're
entitled
to
fees.
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
that's
correct.
and
that
still
would
not...
that
still
would
not
foreclose
the
argument,
the
position
that
we
take
in
this
case.
although,
we--
mr.
james
e.
coleman,
jr.
--in
effect
it
would...
it
would
be
in
the
nature
of
interim
award
of
fees,
such
as
is
done
under
the
civil
rights
act
where
fees
can
be
obtained
on
an
interim
basis
for
significant
successes
short
of
actually
winning
on
the
merits.
