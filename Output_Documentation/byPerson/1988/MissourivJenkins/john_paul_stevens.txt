justice
stevens
of
course,
mr.
farmer,
this
is
not
really
strictly
prejudgment
interest,
is
it?
couldn't
one
argue
that
what's
at
stake
here
is
that
there's
no
sovereign
immunity
that's
been
decided
for
the
liability
for
fees
themselves,
and
the
question
is
just
how
one
measures
the
fee
that's
due,
given
the
delay
in
payment?
there's
no
separately
calculated
item
of
prejudgment,
it's
just
somehow,
it's
mixed
up
in
the
judge's
calculation.
justice
stevens
except
you
don't
have
an
interest
rate
factor.
he
doesn't
say
the
interest
rate
is
6
%
or
something
like
that.
he
just
sort
of
uses
a
rough
method,
what
he
thinks
is
a
reasonable
way
to
come
up
with
a
fair
fee.
justice
stevens
well,
it's
retroactive
just
since,
until
the
suit
was
filed.
justice
stevens
mr.
farmer,
if
you
prevail
in
this
case,
do
you
think
it
would
be
permissible
for
a
judge
to
follow
a
practice
that
sometimes
masters
would
follow,
to
say
require
the
parties
to
make
a
deposit
to
cover
future
liability
for
cost,
and
then
stick
the
money
into
an
interest-bearing
account
to
earn
interest,
and
then
if
the
state
prevailed
they
get
the
money
back
plus
interest,
whereas
if
the
plaintiff
prevailed
they
could
get
their
interest
in
that
manner?
would
that
violate
the
11th
amendment?
justice
stevens
what
if
the
state
at
the
outset
admitted
liability
and
said,
"the
only
thing
we
want
to
fight
about
is
the
nature
of
the
decree.
"
which
is,
i
guess,
what
happened
here
in
1984.
it
was
pretty
clear
that
there
was
going
to
be
liability,
but
there
was
further
litigation.
what
if,
at
that
point,
in
'84,
they
had
said,
"we
now
know
the
plaintiff
is
going
to
be
a
prevailing
party
and
so
there's
going
to
be
some
liability
for
fees,
so
we'll
ask
the
state
to
put
up
$500,000
in
an
interest-bearing
account.
"
what
would
be
wrong
with
that?
justice
stevens
no,
no,
i
say
put
in
on
new
ground
knowing
that
there
was
going
to
be
a
lot
of
litigation
over
the
form
of
the
decree
and
things
of
that
kind,
and
which
end
that
the
plaintiff
is
ultimately
going
to
prevail,
because
it's
been
determined
that
it's
the
prevailing
party.
what
would
be
wrong
with
saying
that,
"we
know
you're
going
to
have
to
pay
these
fees,
so
we
don't
want
the
lawyer
to
work,
just
wait
for
the
money
when
he,
all
this
time,
so
we'll
require
you
to
make
a
deposit.
"
why
would
that
violate
the
11th
amendment?
and
why
is
that
really
in
substance
any
different
from
what's
done
here?
justice
stevens
but,
mr.
farmer,
could
that
argument
be
made
in
this
case
when
it
wasn't
made
in
the
lower
court
and
you're
seeking
a
reversal
of
the
judgment?
justice
stevens
--mr.
farmer,
can
i
ask
a
factual
question?
the
district
court
referred
to
the
paralegals
at
$40
an
hour
and
to
law
clerks
at
$35
an
hour.
what
exactly
is
a
law
clerk
that
he's
talking
about,
do
you
know?
is
this
a
person
not
admitted
to
the
bar
and
doing
summer
work,
or
is
this
a
junior
lawyer
or
what,
do
you
know?
justice
stevens
mr.
farmer,
can
i
interrupt
you
a
second?
the
judge
in
this
case
treated
the
paralegal
time
as
part
of
the
fee
award.
were
not
the
costs
separately
itemized
and
allowed
things
like
transcripts
and
so
forth,
and
the
paralegal
time
was
not
included
in
what
the
judge
called
"costs"?
justice
stevens
i
thought
the
judgment
gave
a
big
lump
sum
for
fees
which
had,
as
a
part
of
it,
all
the
paralegal
hours
and
law
clerk
hours
and
attorney
hours.
justice
stevens
well,
i
thought
there
was
one
figure
for
fees
for
each
of
the
two
firms
which
included
the
paralegal
time
and
all
that,
and
that
the
costs
were
a
separate
item,
covering
things
like
transcripts
and
witness
fees--
justice
stevens
--i
see.
justice
stevens
--i'm
not
sure
that's
right,
mr.
topkis.
say
somebody
goes
into
the
office
and
says,
"what
do
you
charge
an
hour?
"
and
the
lawyer
quotes
him
an
hourly
rate
and
nothing
else
is
said.
and
then
the
matter
takes
four
years
to
conclude.
would
not
the
client
expect
to
be
billed
at
the
rate
he
was
told
when
he
went
into
the
front
door?
