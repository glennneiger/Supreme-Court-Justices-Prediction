chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
88-64,
missouri
v.
kalima
jenkins.
mr.
farmer,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
one
of
your
problems,
it
seems
to
me,
is
to
show
that
this
no-interest
rule
attaches
to
state
sovereign
immunity
under
the
11th
amendment.
you
don't
get
to
whether
there's
a
clear
statement
or
something
like
that
until
you
find
that
that's
an
incident
of
the
state
sovereign
immunity,
it
seems
to
me.
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
do
you
concede
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you're
conceding
the
fact
that
when
it
says,
when
the
statute
provides
for
the
award
of
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee,
it
includes
not
only
a
fee
for
attorneys
but
for
paralegals,
too?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
then
what
are
you
conceding?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
you're
conceding
that
costs
and
expenses,
as
used
in
section
1988,
includes
charges
for
paralegal
time?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
are
you
conceding
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
don't
you
make
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
don't
you
make
it
in
this
court?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
farmer.
mr.
topkis?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
topkis,
do
you
think
paralegals
come
under
the
head
of
1988?
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
you
going
to
answer
the
question?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
i
asked
you
a
question
which
i
don't
believe
you've
answered.
chief
justice
rehnquist
my
question
was,
do
you
think
attorneys'
fees
are
recoverable,
rather,
paralegal
fees
are
recoverable
as
a
part
of
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
or
as
a
part
of
other
costs?
chief
justice
rehnquist
let's
take
reasonable
attorney's
fee.
now,
you
think
that,
in
addition
to
all
the
hours
that
the
attorneys
put
in
and
their
hourly
rate,
under
the
heading
"reasonable
attorney's
fee",
one
can
then
add
paralegal
charges.
chief
justice
rehnquist
then
you
add
secretarial
charges,
too?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
congress
said
"reasonable
attorney's
fee
as
part
of
costs.
"
it
didn't
say
any
more,
did
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
you
feel
that
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
should
include
a
fee
not
only
for
attorneys,
but
for
paralegals?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
topkis.
mr.
farmer,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
farmer.
the
case
is
submitted.
