justice
scalia
should
this
be
any
more
so
than
compensating
attorneys
at
a
market-based
rate?
justice
scalia
it's
better
or
worse?
justice
scalia
do
you
prefer
the
courts
to
say,
"well,
i'm
giving
some
indeterminate
amount
of
interest
here,
i
don't
know
quite
how
much
it
is?
"
you
think
that's
good,
although,
if
you
said,
"i'm
giving
exactly
10
%
interest.
"
it's
bad.
justice
scalia
yes,
we
would,
it
the
suit
were
against
the
united
states.
we
have
held
that.
justice
scalia
well,
the
same
provisions
at
issue
here,
if
applied
against
the
united
states,
would,
according
to
our
decision
in
library
of
congress,
be
held
to
preclude
an
award
of
interest.
justice
scalia
so
that
must
mean
that
we're
willing
to
swallow
that
very
large
camel,
at
least
in
the
context
where
the
united
states
is
the
defendant.
justice
scalia
i'm
just
going
by
what
we
said
in
library
of
congress
anyway.
and
holding
there
certainly
does
have
that
bizarre
consequence
that
you
just
described.
justice
scalia
mr.
topkis,
it
does
make
a
difference
to
me
whether
you
put
it
under
attorneys'
fees
or
costs,
because
you,
it
is
an
impossible
job
to
persuade
me
that
you
get
costs
awarded
on
some
basis
other
than
costs.
i
mean,
it,
i
cannot
go
that
far.
when
you,
when
i
ask
you
to
submit
your
costs,
i
mean
you
submit
your
costs.
justice
scalia
that's
what
"costs"
means.
justice
scalia
well,
so,
you
really
think
it
has
to
be
under
attorneys'
fees
if
it's
going
to
be
anywhere.
justice
scalia
that
is
to
say,
if
it's
going
to
be
compensated
on
market
basis.
and
that's
all
we're
fighting
about
here.
i
can
understand
your
putting
it
under
"costs"
if
all
you're
asking
for
is
out-of-pocket.
but
if
you
want
market,
then
i
don't
see
how
you
can
possibly
get
it
under
"costs".
so
you're
really
left
with
getting
it
under
attorneys'
fees.
justice
scalia
well,
i
don't
deal
with
reality,
mr.
topkis,
i
deal--
[laughter]
--i
deal
with
statutes.
justice
scalia
i
take
it
there
is
no
instance,
counsel,
i
take
it
there's
no
instance
in
which
costs
are
billed
at
anything
other
than
out-of-pocket.
justice
scalia
but
they
don't
charge
the
rates
of
10
years
from
now,
either.
justice
scalia
right.
i
mean,
that's
what
happens,
that
is
what
is
happening
here.
i
mean,
by
the
time
recovery
is
obtained,
the
rates
being
charged
are
the
rates
of
five
years
after
the
time
the
services
were
performed.
right?
justice
scalia
whatever
the
time--
justice
scalia
a
million
dollars
here,
a
million...
you
know,
sen.
dirksen's
line.
first
thing
you
know,
it
adds
up
to
real
money.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
mr.
farmer,
could
i
ask
you
about
where
you
draw
the
line
with
respect
to
the
principle
you're
talking
about,
that
the
11th
amendment
requires
us
to
interpret
statutes
strictly
against
state
liability.
i
mean,
i
can
understand
that
where
the
question
is,
are
states
covered
by
this
statute
or
are
they
not
covered.
but
once
you
know
that
the
state
is
covered,
every
single
issue
of
law
that
comes
up
in
the
interpretation
of
that
statute
we
have
to,
we
have
to
interpret
in
favor
of
the
state
unless
congress
has
made
its
intent
unalterably
clear?
so,
for
example,
we
should
interpret
attorneys'
fees
not
to
cover
fees
for
counselors
at
law
in
those
states
where
they
are
not
called
attorneys?
that
can't
be
right.
i
mean--
justice
scalia
--so
where
do
you
stop?
why
should
i
go
along
with
you
as
far
as
you
want
to
go,
to
say
that
you
can't
get
interest?
