justice
o'connor
mr.
farmer,
may
i
ask
whether
you
concede
that
recovery
for
paralegal
services
is
included
in
attorneys'
fees
recovery?
justice
o'connor
well,
you
didn't
challenge
that.
justice
o'connor
you
just
want
to
quibble
over
actual
costs
or
market.
so,
i
take
it
that
you
must
accept
the
fact
that
recovery
may
be
obtained.
justice
o'connor
well,
what
is
your
position?
suppose
the
local
market
indicates
that,
generally,
paralegal
services
are
billed
separately
for
legal
services
rendered
in
cases.
justice
o'connor
so
you
do
concede,
in
effect,
that
they
are
recoverable
under
those
circumstances
as
a
separate
item
on
the
bill
for
attorneys'
fees.
justice
o'connor
what's
the
practice,
generally,
around
the
country,
do
you
think?
are
paralegal
fees
billed
as
attorneys'
fees--
justice
o'connor
so
it
depends
on
whether
we
treat
the
paralegal
fees
as
attorneys'
fees
or
separately
as
costs,
under
your
argument.
justice
o'connor
but
doesn't
work
by
attorneys
normally
include
an
amount
of
overhead
for
secretarial
services
and
all
kinds
of
things
that
aren't
"work
by
attorneys",
that's
incorporated
in
attorneys'
fees.
what
is
this?
is
it
part
of
costs
or
part
of
attorneys'
fees?
justice
o'connor
its
principles
may
be
exactly
the
same,
if
we
recognize
state
sovereign
immunity.
justice
o'connor
yes.
justice
o'connor
well,
is
that
so?
i
think
the
11th
amendment
may
have
arisen
out
of
a
concern
for
state
sovereign
immunity,
don't
you?
justice
o'connor
because
the
states
were
sovereign.
justice
o'connor
they
were
sovereign
states
coming
together
in
a
federation.
