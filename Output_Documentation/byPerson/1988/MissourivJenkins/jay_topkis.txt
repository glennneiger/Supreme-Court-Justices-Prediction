mr.
jay
topkis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
begin,
if
i
may,
with
some
comments
on
questions
that
were
put
to
my
friend,
mr.
farmer,
in
the
course
of
his
argument.
first,
in
connection
with
a
question
that
justice
stevens
put,
i
must
advise
the
court
that
there
is
no
reference
whatsoever
in
the
trial
court's
opinion,
or
in
the
record,
to
any
$15
or
$20
differential
between
historic
and
current
market
rates
for
lawyers.
that's,
i
don't
know
where
mr.
farmer
got
that
from,
but
he
certainly
didn't
get
it
from
the
record
here.
the
fact
is
that
the
state
chose
to
offer
no
proof
whatsoever
as
to
historical
rates,
and
now
comes
before
this
court
and
says,
"we
want
historical
rates
to
govern.
"
it
seems
to
me
that
the
state
should
have
made
up
its
mind
some
time
ago.
justice
kennedy--
mr.
jay
topkis
--there
was,
indeed,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
topkis
he
said
that
he
was
taking,
actually,
he
divided
his
treatment
between
the
way
he
treated
mr.
benson
and
the
way
he
treated
everybody
else.
in
both
situations,
in
varying
ways,
he
did
say
that
he
was
using
current
market
rates
and,
in
consideration
of
the
fact
that
there
had
been
delay
in
com,
in
payment--
mr.
jay
topkis
--that
is
exactly
the
situation,
your
honor.
if
i
may,
there
is
a
sharp
distinction
between
what
the
court
did
here,
where
he
said,
looking
at
everything,
i
think
i
have
to
take
the
fact
that
there
has
been
delay
into
account,
without
specifying
what
account
he
gave
it,
and
what
happened
in
library
of
congress
against
shaw,
on
which
my
friend
relies,
where
the
district
court
very
deliberately
set
out
to
award
10
%
per
annum
by
way
of
interest
on--
mr.
jay
topkis
--better
or
worse
for
whom?
mr.
jay
topkis
well,
i
think
i've
got
a
two-pronged
argument.
as
i'm
sure
your
honor
knows
from
our
brief,
we
take
the
position
that
the
11th
amendment
has
no
application
here
and
so
on.
but
i
think
that
it
is
perfectly
reasonable
to
say,
to
draw
the
dividing
line
that
judge
ginsberg
drew
in
library
of
congress
against
shaw,
where
she
said
that
if
a
court,
where
she
said
that
she
thought
interest
is
bad.
a
flat
award
of
10
%
per
annum
or
whatever
is
forbidden
by
the
11th
amendment.
but,
taking
the
fact
of
delay
in
payment
into
account,
along
with
all
of
the
other
factors
appropriate
for
setting
a
fee,
is
permissible
under
the,
under,
there
she
was
speaking
not
of
the
11th
amendment,
of
course.
but
we
also
see
a
difference
between
the
11th
amendment
and
the
common-law
immunity
of
the
states.
the
11th
amendment...
pardon
me,
of
the
sovereign...
the
11th
amendment,
of
course,
derives
from
one
source,
and
the
no-interest
rule
derives
from
a
very
different
one.
now,
the,
there's
another
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
in
response
to
a
question
from
justice
kennedy.
your
honor
asked
mr.
farmer
what
his
position
was,
i'll
make
bold
to
tell
the
court
what
our
position
is.
our
position
is
that
reasonable
compensation
means
reasonable
compensation.
we
don't
know,
as
i
said,
what
the
difference
is
between,
was,
historical
and
market
rates.
but
let's
suppose
we
were
still
in
a
time
of
17
%,
18
%
annual
inflation,
which
we
saw
some
years
ago.
now
let's
suppose
that
this
went
on
for
years.
would
anyone
call
an
award
whose
value
was
devalued
by
40
%
or
50
%
or
60
%
because
of
delay
"reasonable
compensation"?
i
can't
imagine
it.
mr.
jay
topkis
held
that
it
would
be
"reasonable
compensation",
your
honor?
mr.
jay
topkis
that
is
true.
in
that
context,
i
certainly
must
agree
with
you.
mr.
jay
topkis
well,
i
think,
perhaps,
if
it
came
up
before
the
court
in
those
circumstances,
the
situation
might
be
different.
but
i
don't
know.
i
don't
attempt
to
forecast
what
this
court
will
do.
i
just
try
in
my
humble
way
to
influence
it.
mr.
jay
topkis
and
i
suggest,
with
all
respect,
that
library
of
congress
is
not
determinative
here
and
that
its
rule,
whatever
its
merits
in
that
context,
calls
for
no
particular
attention
in
this
context.
mr.
jay
topkis
yes.
mr.
jay
topkis
i'm
forced
to
agree
with
that.
but
if
you
recognize
state
sovereign
immunity,
you
would
have
to
recognize
that
you
were
departing
from
the
roots,
the
bases
of
the
11th
amendment.
the
11th
amendment
didn't
come
out
of
a
concern--
mr.
jay
topkis
--with
all
respect,
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
the
11th
amendment
arose
more
out
of
a
concern
for
the
federalist
system,
a
concern
for
the
proposition
that
the
states
should
not
be
called
to
account
for
anything
in
the
federal
courts.
mr.
jay
topkis
your
honor
may
hold
that
view,
and
i
certainly
am
not
going
to
attempt
to
do
other
than
put
forward
the
view
that
it
was
not
because
the
states
were
sovereign,
having
the
mystical
attributes
of
the
sovereign,
the
king,
the
almighty,
but
because
the
states
were
federated,
that
they
were
independent
entities
coming
together
by
consensus
to
form
these
united
states
of
america.
mr.
jay
topkis
sovereign,
yes,
but
not
sovereign
in
the
sense
of
necessarily
possessing
immunity.
it
was
because
the
federal
system
would
work
best.
and
i
think
that
was
justice
holmes'
phrase,
it
won't
come
to
me
quite...
but
it's
important
that
the
system
work,
we
all
know
that.
and
i
submit
that
the
11th
amendment
was
adopted
in
order
to
help
attain
that
objective...
not
because
of
any
mystical
concern
with
the
integrity
of
the
king
or
anything
of
the
kind,
but
because
it
was
a
deal.
and
the
deal
would
never
have
been
made,
as
so
many
historians
have
pointed
out.
the
deal
that
was
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
would
never
have
been
made
had
the
states
not
believed
that
they
would
never
be
amenable
to
suit
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states.
now,
there
was,
if
i
may
pass
to
another
point,
there
was
lurking
in
the
conversation,
while
mr.
farmer
was
up,
some
reference
to
the
time
period
that
elapsed
between
the
decision
on
liability
and
the
application
for
fees.
i
would
accept
no
penalty
for
that,
certainly,
because
the
fact
is
that,
after
the
decision
on
liability
was
announced
by
judge
clark,
he
said
he
was
going
to
hold
up
on
any
fee
award
pending
appeal
of
that
liability
decision,
because,
until
then,
he
wouldn't
know
who
was
the
prevailing
party
and
it
would
be
a
futile
exercise
to
attempt
to
award
fees.
and
it's
significant
to
note
that
both
sides
consented
to
that
treatment.
now,
mr.
farmer
said
that
plaintiff's
expert
testified,
and
this
is
on
the
subject
of
paralegals,
he
said
that
plaintiff's
expert...
and
he
was
referring
to
one
of
our
experts,
a
personal
injury
lawyer
from
kansas
city
named
max
foust.
he
said
that
our
expert,
mr.
foust,
testified
that
he
didn't
bill
separately
for
paralegals.
and
that
is
the
way
the
record
reads.
what
mr.
foust
said
was,
"i
don't
have
any
truck
with
that
kind
of
fancy
nonsense.
"
"i
make
contingency
arrangements
with
my
clients,
33-1/3
%
if
i
settle,
and
40
%
if
i
go
to
trial.
"
"that's
enough
for
me.
"
mr.
foust
said.
it
would
be
enough
for
most
of
us,
i
respectfully
suggest.
but
in
any
event,
he
said
also
that
whatever
the
practice
of
personal
injury
lawyers
in
kansas
city,
he
knew
very
well
that
the
kansas
city
law
firms
that
bill
on
an
hourly
basis
uniformly
bill
paralegals
at
$40
to
$50
an
hour,
not
at
cost,
but
the
$40
to
$50
an
hour
was
the
market
in
kansas
city.
the
district
court
here
awarded
us
the
low
end
of
that
range.
another--
mr.
jay
topkis
--if
i
may,
your
honor,
i
would
answer
that
question
by
saying
that
the
overall
thrust
of
1988
is
to
put
civil
rights
plaintiffs
on
a
par
with
all
other
plaintiffs
in
competing
for
legal
services.
and
that,
in
consequence,
their
lawyers,
if
they
are
to
have
equal
access
to
lawyers,
their
lawyers
must
be
compensated
as
lawyers
in
other
cases
are
compensated--
mr.
jay
topkis
--yes,
i
will,
and
i
will
say,
in
consequence,
it
appears
to
me
that
market
should
determine
because
market
is
what
determines
in
all
other
contexts.
mr.
jay
topkis
i
apologize.
mr.
jay
topkis
i
would
say,
i
would
say
with
all
respect
that
i
don't
think
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference--
mr.
jay
topkis
--i
would
be
quite
content
to
see
that--
mr.
jay
topkis
--no,
because
that's
not
the
way
the
profession
behaves.
it
seems
to
me
that
when
congress
said
"award
reasonable
attorneys'
fees
as
part
of
costs.
"
congress
said
the
legislative
history
is
perfectly
plain--
mr.
jay
topkis
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
nor
did
it
specify
costs,
item
by
item.
mr.
jay
topkis
i'll
take
it
there
or
i'll
take
it
as
part
of
costs,
but
in
either
event,
i
want
paralegals
to
be
compensated
on
a
par
so
that
the
plaintiffs,
the
civil
rights
plaintiffs,
are
not
disadvantaged.
because
putting
them
on
a
par
was
exactly
where
the
congress
meant
to
go.
mr.
jay
topkis
you
mean
out-of-pocket
expenses.
mr.
jay
topkis
that's
what
it
does
to
me,
too,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
topkis
well,
i
would
submit
again
that--
mr.
jay
topkis
--as
a
logical
matter,
i
am,
of
course,
in
total
accord
with
your
honor.
but
the
reality
sometimes
is
a
little
different
from
logic.
and
the
reality
here
is
that
you've
got
to
put
it
somewhere,
and
if
you
want
me
to
pick
somewhere,
all
right,
i'll
pick
it
as
attorneys'
fees.
but
you
could
easily
come
back
at
me
by
saying,
"one
thing
we
know
about
paralegals
is
that
they're
not
attorneys.
"
and--
mr.
jay
topkis
--i
think
better
of
your
honor
than
that,
with
all
respect.
[laughter]
mr.
jay
topkis
oh,
i
think
there
are
many
instances,
your
honor.
very
frequently,
you--
mr.
jay
topkis
--the
statute
allows
you
a
certain
cost
regardless
of
what
your
actual
costs
have
been.
usually
it's
less.
but,
but
i--
mr.
jay
topkis
--i
can't
recall.
i
can't
think
of
any.
no.
my
argument
on
this
point,
to
belabor
it,
is
the
argument
of
parity.
and
if
you
want
to
single
out
civil
rights
plaintiffs
and
their
lawyers
as
bearing,
as
required
to
be
some
kind
of
lesser
citizens,
i
don't
think
that's
what
congress
intended.
now,
the--
mr.
jay
topkis
--not
required
to
recognize
them.
mr.
jay
topkis
your
honor
has
the
advantage
of
me
in
being
familiar
with
this
court's
decision
in
the
bergeron
case,
which
was
announced
this
morning.
but
i
would
say
that
i
think
that
a
reasonable
fee
means
a
reasonable
fee.
and
i
can't
really
add
very
much
to
that--
mr.
jay
topkis
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
jay
topkis
well,
i'm
not
sure
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
what
economists
teach
us
is
that
barring
collusion,
the
market
produces
what
is
reasonable.
that's
what
the
economists
tell
us.
but
this
is
an
area
in
which,
i
confess,
i
proceed
with
the
greatest
hesitancy.
now,
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize...
to
keep
in
mind,
if
i
may
alter
it...
when
we're
discussing
the
11th
amendment,
that
the
first
question
that
was
presented
here
is
really
a
misstatement
of
the
issue,
and
i
mean
no
disrespect,
of
course,
when
i
say
that.
but
the
first
question
presented
was
whether
the
11th
amendment
prohibits
an
award
of
attorneys'
fees
against
a
state
based
on
current
hourly
rates,
which
include
interest
and
a
delay-in-payment
factor.
well,
the
current
hourly
rates
here,
there's
nothing
in
this
record
to
suggest
that
they
include
interest.
i've
never
heard
of
a
current
hourly
rate
which
includes
interest.
when
your
honors
were
at
the
bar,
i
rather
imagine
that
you
didn't
have
that
concept
in
mind.
certainly
there's
nothing
in
this
record
on
it.
and,
equally,
current
hourly
rates
do
not
include
a
delay-in-payment
factor.
most
lawyers
like
to
be
paid
very,
very
promptly,
and
they
don't
build
a
delay-in-payment
factor
into
their
current
hourly
rates.
mr.
jay
topkis
ten
years
prospectively,
you
mean?
mr.
jay
topkis
well,
yeah--
mr.
jay
topkis
--whatever
the
numbers,
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
and
judge
clark
said
that
he
was
looking
at
the
delay-in-payment
factor.
i
said
before...
if
i
may
interrupt
myself,
justice
scalia...
i
said
before
that
he
treated
arthur
benson
differently
from
the
rest.
he,
what
he
did
with
mr.
benson
was
to
say
that,
on
the
basis
of
skill
and
experience
in
the
kansas
city
current
practices,
mr.
benson's
current
hourly
rate
ought
to
be
$175,
but
that
he
was
going
to
give
him
an
enhancement
to
$200
an
hour
because
of
three
factors.
one
was
the
fact
that
mr.
benson
was
precluded
during
this
representation
from
representing
anyone
else.
he
couldn't
accept
any
other
clients
for
a
period
of
two
and
a
half
years
or
something
like
that.
in
effect,
he
bet
his
professional
life
on
this
case
and,
as
the
record
reveals,
he
went
into
debt
to
the
extent
of
600
and
some-odd
thousand
dollars.
so,
all
right,
judge
clark
thought
that
that
was
a
factor
appropriate
to
be
recognized.
the
next
was
the
unpopularity
of
the
case.
and
judge
clark
thought,
referred
to
newspaper
editorials
and
newspaper
stories
and
letters
to
the
press
and
letters
to
the
court
denouncing
this
case.
mr.
benson
became
a
pariah
and
judge
clark
thought
that
that
was
a
factor
that
might
be
taken
account
of
in
setting
a
fair
rate.
and,
finally,
he
thought
that
the
delay
in
payment
should
be
considered.
he
didn't
allocate
anything
for
each
of
these
factors
particularly.
he
just
said,
taking
everything
together,
he
thought
$200
was
an
appropriate
fee.
i
don't
see
that
as
any
award
of
interest.
if
you
split
the
$25,
which
is
14
%
enhancement,
three
ways
to
account
for
the
three
factors,
that
would
be
about
5
%
for
a
delay
of
several
years.
i've
never
seen
an
interest
table
that
gave
you
less
than
1
%
in
interest.
on
the
subject
of
being
a
pariah
and
proper
compensation
for
that
factor,
let
me
call
to
the
court's
attention
something
that,
to
me,
as
a
veteran
of
some
class
actions,
strikes
me
as
significant.
this
was
a
class
action.
there
were
class
action
plaintiffs
available
by
the,
probably,
hundreds
of
thousands,
every
black
school
kid
in
kansas
city
was
a
potential
plaintiff.
the
extraordinary
thing
about
this
litigation
is
that
not
one
lawyer
in
kansas
city
or
anybody
else
stepped
forward
to
join
in
this
case.
if
it
had
been
an
antitrust
case,
or
if
it
had
been
a,
if
the
hyatt
hotel
had
collapsed,
if
whatever,
a
securities
act
case,
there
would
have
been
hoards
of
lawyers
coming
in,
saying,
"i
want
a
piece
of
the
pie.
"
nobody
joined
arthur
benson.
he
remained
alone
until
the
legal
defense
fund
came
to
join
him.
i
think
that,
too,
is
worthy
of
consideration,
and
so
did
judge
clark.
now,
i
think
that's
about,
really,
all
i
have
to
say,
or
need
to
say
on
the
question
of
the
way
judge
clark
treated
this.
taking
everything
into
account,
he
thought
$200
was
fair.
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
the
11th
amendment
stands
in
the
way
of
that
kind
of
setting
of
a
reasonable
fee.
it
seems
to
me
totally
responsive
to
the
statutory
command.
now,
i
think
that
it
might
be
appropriate
to
mention
that
the
use
of
current
rates
in
billing,
in
the
experience
of
all
of
us,
conforms
to
the
practice
of
the
profession.
i
have
never
seen,
i
don't
think
any
member
of
this
court
has
ever
seen
a
bill
which
read
something
like,
"for
services
performed
in
1987,
at
1987
rates,
dollars
x;
for
services
performed
in
1988,
at
1988
rates,
dollars
y;
and
for
services
performed
in
1989,
at
1989
rates,
dollars
whatever.
"
i
might
kick
myself
for
having
waited
so
long
to
render
a
bill,
but
i
think
that
the
uniform
practice
of
the
bar,
when
it
renders
bills,
is
to
bill
them
out
at
current
rates.
mr.
jay
topkis
i
would
think,
in
that
case,
yes,
your
honor.
absolutely.
now,
one
final
observation
on
that
point,
and
that
is
this.
as
i've
said,
while
this
date...
record
contains
no
data
specific
to
kansas
city,
it
is
clear
that
in
the
midwest,
generally,
market
rates
in
the
period
with
which
we
are
concerned
did
not
keep
pace
with
inflation.
our
expert
on
rates,
mr.
well,
testified
to
that
effect
without
contradiction.
and
i
said
that
the
circumstances
of
this
case
make
it
particularly
appropriate
to
recognize
the
delay
in
payment.
mr.
benson
went
into
personal
debt
to
the
extent
of
$633,000
to
fund
this
case.
and
he
paid
$113,000
in
interest
by
december
31,
1986.
and
he
was
continuing
to
pay
interest
at
the
rate
of
$5,000
a
month.
for
the
legal
defense
fund,
the
case
was
a
near
disaster.
we...
i'm
proud
to
be
a
member
of
the
board
of
the
organization...
we
experienced
deficits
which
we
had
never
experienced
before
in
1983
and
1984
because
of
the
burden
of
this
case.
now,
the
state
says,
of
course,
that
we
should
be
happy
with
historical
rates.
but,
as
i've
mentioned,
the
state
put
in
no
evidence
of
historical
rates,
so
we
don't
know
whether
to
be
happy
or
not.
and
i
may
say
that,
so
far
as
the
record
reveals,
that
1987
current
market
rates,
which
judge
clark
used,
were
the
same
as
or
higher
than
rates
in
'83
or
'84.
i
don't
know.
we
don't
know.
there's
no
evidence.
now,
what
the
state
would
apparently
like
is
for
this
court
to
remand
so
that
we
could
have
a
trial
on
that
issue.
well,
the
state
had
its
chance,
i
respectfully
suggest.
this
court
has
said,
and
so
many
of
the
lower
courts
have
echoed,
that
we
musn't
allow
these
fee
controversies
to
become
second
jarndyce
against
jarndyce
litigation.
that's
the
very
real
danger
with
which
we
deal.
and
so
i
say,
on
the
11th
amendment,
we
wind
up
like
this.
there
was
no
award
here
of
interest.
there
was
no
dollar
or
percentage
award
or
adjustment
for
delay
in
payment.
there
was
only
a
recognition
by
the
trial
judge
that
there
had
been
great
delay
in
payment,
and
an
attempt
to
deal
with
that
by
using
current
rather
than
historical
rates
to
award
reasonable
fees.
now,
let
me,
oh,
i
don't
think
i
need
trouble
the
court
with
a
review
of
the
legal
authorities.
your
honors
are
doubtless
infinitely
more
familiar
with
them
than
i
am.
just
a
final
word
or
two
on
the
question
of
paralegals.
i,
oh,
no,
if
i
may
stay
with
the
11th
amendment
for
just
a
second.
this
court
has
often
said
that
the
reason
for
requiring
unmistakably
clear
language,
when
the
congress
sets
out
to
abrogate
11th
amendment
protection,
is
so
that
enormous
fiscal
burdens...
and
i
quote...
"shall
not
be
imposed
on
the
states
by
the
congress
without
careful
thought.
"
that's
reasonable
enough.
but
we
have
here
no
enormous
fiscal
burdens.
as
i've
seen,
we
don't
know
the
historical
rate
that
the
state
will
employ.
but
the
total
fee
award
here
for
services
was
only
around
$3.2
million.
so
use
of
historical
figures
would
save
the
state,
what,
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars?
to
the
state--
mr.
jay
topkis
--right.
right.
nice
to
see
a
devotee
of
the
classics.
[laughter]
it
adds
up
to
real
money
to
two
interests,
your
honor.
not
to
the
state
of
missouri,
with
all
respect.
this
case,
at
the
very
least,
is
going
to
involve
vast
expenditure
by
the
state.
the
people
to
whom
these
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars,
or
this
million
dollars,
will
make
all
the
difference
in
the
world,
are
arthur
benson
and
the
legal
defense
fund.
thank
you
very
much.
