justice

well,
let
me
simply
say
it
can't
be
an
attorney's
fee,
under
the
statute,
if
it's
work
done
by
non-attorneys.
justice
white
there
was
such
mention
of
compensating
for
delay,
wasn't
there?
justice
white
and
the
judge
did
compensate
for
delay.
justice
white
joe,
we
just
don't
know
how
much
compensation
there
was
for
delay.
justice
white
you
don't,
even
if
the
market
would
say
that
lawyers
in
this
community
do
these
cases
on
a
contingency,
you
don't,
you
aren't
required
to
recognize
contingency
fee
arrangements,
are
you,
under
1988?
justice
white
in
one,
it
says
in
a
1983
damages
suit,
and
there's
a
recovery
and
the
contingent
fee,
the
contract
is,
would
give
him,
would
give
the
attorney
twice
as
much
as
what
hours
times
a
reasonable
rate
would
produce.
can
you
make
the
defendant
pay
that?
justice
white
no
matter
what
the
market
says.
justice
white
no
matter
what
the
market
is
in
kansas
city.
