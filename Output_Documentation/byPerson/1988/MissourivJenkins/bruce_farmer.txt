mr.
bruce
farmer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
in
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
8th
circuit.
petitioners
are
the
state
of
missouri
and
its
officials
found
liable
in
their
official
capacity.
we
present
two
issues
involving
the
attorney's
field
ward
arising
out
of
the
kansas
city,
mo.,
desegregation
case.
the
first
is
an
11th
amendment
immunity
issue,
this
time
as
it
pertains
to
a
section
1988
fee
award
that
includes
prejudgment
interest
or
compensation
for
delay
in
payment.
the
second
issue
concerns
an
issue
that
was
also
involved
in
the
blanchard
v.
bergeron
case,
and
that
concerns
the
proper
method
of
compensation
for
paralegal
services.
i
would
like
to
briefly
address
the
11th
amendment
issue
first,
and
while
the
underlying
facts
in
this
case
have
been
complex,
only
a
few
facts
are
relevant
now.
the
kansas
city
desegregation
case
began
in
1977.
the
fee
award,
however,
went
to
two
groups
of
attorneys
who
entered
the
case
later.
kansas
city
attorney
arthur
benson
and
his
staff
entered
the
case
in
1979
and
was
awarded
$1.7
million
in
fees
and
expenses
for
the
period
through
june
of
1986.
the
naacp
legal
defense
fund
entered
the
case
in
1982
and
were
awarded
$2.4
million.
the
plaintiffs
became
prevailing
parties
in
september
of
1984.
the
fee
applications
were
filed
in
february
of
1986.
the
fee
awards
were
based
on
current
rather
than
historical
hourly
rates.
this
was
expressly
done
to
compensate
for
delay
in
payment.
out
of
approximately
18,000
attorney
hours
compensated,
about
85
%
were
incurred
in
the
years
1983
and
1984.
the
record
shows
that
the
current
hourly
rates
used
were
approximately
$15
to
$20
higher
than
the
historical
rates
for
this
period.
now,
the
11th
amendment
and
the
current
status
of
the
11th
amendment
is
involved
in
at
least
two
other
cases
before
this
court
this
term.
pennsylvania
v.
union
gas
argued
last
october
and
gilhool
v.
muth
scheduled
to
be
argued
next
week.
the
issue
was
also
touched
on
briefly
in
wheel
v.
michigan
state
department
of
state
police
argued
in
december.
the
11th
amendment
has
been
explored
in
great
detail
in
previous
recent
opinions
of
this
court.
i'm
not
sure
that
i
can
add
much
to
the
detailed
historical
argument.
in
this
case,
it
is
the
state's
position
that
compensation
for
delay
in
payment
or
prejudgment
interest
is
barred
by
the
11th
amendment,
and
we
submit
that
the
principles
set
forth
in
this
court's
library
of
congress
v.
shaw
decision
can
be
extended
to
an
11th
amendment
context.
now,
library
of
congress
dealt
with
the
fee-shifting
provision
of
title
vii
and
the
federal
government's
sovereign
immunity
in
the
long-standing
no-interest
rule.
sovereign
immunity
was
expressly
waived
concerning
attorneys'
fees
and
costs,
but
this
court
found
that
it
was
not
waived
concerning
the
sovereign's
immunity
from
interest.
we
believe
it
can
be
extended
to
the
11th
amendment
context
because
of
the
numerous
similarities
between
the
fee-shifting
provision
of
title
vii
and
section
1988.
first,
section
1988,
when
enacted
by
congress,
congress
specifically
relied
on
the
language
of
title
vii,
the
fee-shifting
provision
of
title
vii.
the
identical
relevant
phrase
is
found
in
both
fee-shifting
provisions,
that
is,
"a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
as
part
of
costs.
"
in
analyzing
these
words,
this
court
has
already
determined
that
they
do
not
include
prejudgment
interest
or
compensation
for
delay.
more
importantly,
the
standard
for
finding
a
congressional
abrogation
of
the
11th
amendment
immunity
is
just
as
strict,
if
not
more
so,
as
the
standard
for
finding
a
congressional
waiver
of
the
united
states
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
bruce
farmer
that's
correct.
and
we
believe
it
can
be
extended
to
the
11th
amendment
because
of
the
character
of
the
element
we're
talking
about
here.
prejudgment
interest,
or
compensation
for
delay,
or
whatever
term
is
used
to
describe
the
time
value
of
money,
is
traditionally
an
element
of
damages,
not
cost.
and
the
11th
amendment
immunity
is
protective
of
the
state's
liability
from
elements
of
damages.
and
that's,
the
character
of
prejudgment
interest
is
one
of
damages.
we
do
not
believe
it's
relevant
that
the
missouri
has
a
general
stare
statute
that
has
been
interpreted
by
stare
courts
to
allow
prejudgment
interest
against
the
state.
this
is--
mr.
bruce
farmer
--well,
it
is
mixed
up
in
the
judge's
calculation,
but
it
was
separately
calculated
in
terms
of
a,
he
specifically
found
that
current
hourly
rates
used
were
$15
or
$20
higher
than
the
historical
rates,
and
that
was
done
to
compensate
for
delay.
and
compensation
for
delay
is
the
same
as
prejudgment
interest.
mr.
bruce
farmer
that's
correct.
it
is
a
rough
method,
but
it's
a
method
nonetheless
to
compensate
for
the
time
value
of
money,
and
it's
to
compensate
for
a
period
before
the
judgment,
so
therefore
it
takes
the
character
of
retroactive
liability,
in
that
sense.
because
this--
mr.
bruce
farmer
--well,
it's
retroactive
in
the
sense,
to
the
time
the
attorneys'
fees
were
incurred,
and
attorneys'
fees
could
be
incurred
before
the
suit
was
filed--
mr.
bruce
farmer
--obviously,
the
fee
is
going
to
be
a
little
bit
less.
the
question
under
section
1988
is
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
and
does
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
include
prejudgment
interest
or
compensation
for
delay--
mr.
bruce
farmer
--but
under
fee-shifting
statutes,
attorneys
are
typically,
the
standard
is
not
fully
compensated.
it's
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee.
attorneys
and
fee-shifting
litigation--
mr.
bruce
farmer
--no,
your
honor.
that's...
our
position
is
that
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee,
under
the
statute,
would
not
include
prejudgment
interest
or
compensation
for
delay.
the
policy
reasons
for
including
prejudgment
interest
or
compensation
for
delay
are
reasonable.
i
concede
that.
they
may
be
persuasive
if
addressed
to
congress.
those
policy
reasons
apply
equally
as
strong
in
the
title
vii
fee-shifting
statute,
which
this
court
found
that
reasonable
attorneys'
fees,
that
also
does
not
include
prejudgment
interest
or
compensation
for
delay.
mr.
bruce
farmer
i
think
there
would
be
serious
questions
involved
in
whether
you
could
require
the
state,
prior
to
any
judgment,
to
deposit
a
certain
amount
in
escrow
to
satisfy
any
future
liability
for
attorneys'
fees.
i
don't
think
that
would
be
proper.
i
don't
think
the
11th
amendment
would
allow
for
that.
you're
already
requiring
the
state
to
commit
funds
it
otherwise
would
have
available
for
other
reasons
and
to
lock
them
away
so
they
can't
be--
mr.
bruce
farmer
--certainly
the
statute,
i
think,
section
1988
allows
for
interim
fees.
that
has
been
done
in
this
case.
mr.
bruce
farmer
well,
in
substance,
it's
different
than
what's
done
here
because
here
there
was
no
judgment
on
the
attorneys'
fees
until
long
after
the
liability
order
had
been
issued
and
the
judgment
took
into
account
the
delay
in
payment.
if,
immediately
after
the
liability
order,
interim
fees
had
been
requested,
certainly
things
may
have
proceeded
differently
in
the
district
court.
requiring
a
deposit,
i
think,
is
no
different
than
allowing
for
an
award
of
interim
fees,
depending
on
the
specific
factual
circumstances
of
the
case.
so,
since
an
interim
fee
award
would
not
be
barred
by
the
11th
amendment,
requiring
a
deposit
probably
would
not
be,
either.
but,
i
think
the
better
practice
would
be
to
provide
for
an
interim
fee
award,
pending
resolution
of
the
fees
or
the
remedy,
the
scope
of
the
remedy.
in
this
case,
this
action
arose
under
federal
law,
and
we
contend
that
the
payability
of
prejudgment
interest
is
governed
by
federal
law.
just
last
term,
in
west
virginia
v.
united
states,
this
court
unanimously
held
that
the
question
of
prejudgment
interest
is
not
controlled
by
stare
statute
or
local
common
law.
a
single
nationwide
rule
is
preferable
to
one
turning
on
state
law.
now,
that
case
dealt
with
a
claim
by
the
federal
government
against
a
state
and
whether
prejudgment
interest
could
be
awarded
as
part
of
damages
on
a
contractual
obligation.
there,
the
states
had
no
sovereign
immunity
as
against
the
federal
government,
but
the
state
is
protected
by
sovereign
immunity,
the
11th
amendment
immunity,
as
against
private
parties.
we
submit
that
this
is
simply
a
straightforward
application
of
the
principles
in
shaw,
and
that
the
11th
amendment
prohibits
prejudgment
interest
as
a
delay,
or,
a
delay-in-payment
factor.
i'd
like
to
turn
now
to
the
paralegal
issue.
the
paralegal
hours,
in
this
case,
were
compensated
at
a
market-based
rate,
and,
again,
current
hourly
rates
were
used
for
delay
in
payment.
mr.
bruce
farmer
it's
not
necessary
for
me
to
concede
that
in
this
case.
i
recognize
that--
mr.
bruce
farmer
--we
did
not
challenge
that
in
this
case.
mr.
bruce
farmer
well,
to
be
honest,
your
honor,
in
looking
at
this
issue
in
front
of
the
district
court,
we
litigated
the
issue
that
we
felt
we
could
win
on.
we
did
not
think
we
could
win
on
saying
that
paralegal
fees
were
not
separately
compensable
at
all.
i
think
a
reasonable
argument
could
be
made
to
that
effect.
we
are
not
making
that
here
because,
i
think,
the
record
shows--
mr.
bruce
farmer
--and
i
think
that's
what
has
been
shown
here.
the
record
shows
that
the
local
market
typically
bills
separately
for
paralegal
services.
so
it's
not
included
in
the
hourly
rate
awarded
to
the
attorney.
mr.
bruce
farmer
under
those
circumstances,
they
could--
mr.
bruce
farmer
--well,
in
this
case,
the
attorney's
fee,
the
market
rate--
mr.
bruce
farmer
--no.
mr.
bruce
farmer
i
think
i'm...
the
statute
includes
attorneys'
fees,
includes
compensable
items
in
two
separate
categories:
attorneys'
fees
and
costs.
if
an
item,
if
it
is
not
an
attorney
doing
work,
then
it's
in
the
second
category.
if
it's
not
included
in
the
attorney's
hourly
rate,
then
it's
in
the
second
category,
the
category
of
costs
or
expenses.
mr.
bruce
farmer
we
didn't
raise
that
issue
in
this
case--
mr.
bruce
farmer
--well,
i
will
not
concede
it
as
a
matter
of
law.
i
think
a
reasonable
argument
could
be
made
that
it
does
not--
mr.
bruce
farmer
--because,
in
this
case,
we
felt
the
equitable
resolution,
and
under
the
particular--
mr.
bruce
farmer
--well,
in
this
court,
i
will
make
the
argument.
the
cost
and
expenses
back
in
1976,
when
section
1988
was
enacted,
compensation,
separate
compensation
or
separate
billing
for
paralegals
was
not
a
widespread
practice.
therefore,
an
argument
could
be
made,
i
think,
that
congress
did
not
consider--
mr.
bruce
farmer
--that's
why
we
are
not
making
it
in
this
court,
your
honor.
we
took
the
position
in
the
lower
courts
what
we
felt
was
fair
and
equitable
under
the
specific
circumstances
of
this
case.
and
that
is
that
the
reimbursement
of
paralegal
services
should
be
under
the
actual
cost
method,
not
at
a
market-based
rate.
mr.
bruce
farmer
well,
i
think
the
practice
varies.
i
think
the
prevalent
practice
is
to
bill
separately.
mr.
topkis
may
ba
able
to
answer
to
answer
that
better
than
i
can,
because
i've
spent
my
entire
career
in
government
service.
some
attorneys
do
not,
for
example,
the
plaintiff's
expert
in
the
attorney
fee
litigation
in
this
case
testified
that
he
did
not
bill
separately
for
paralegal
time.
so
i
think
the
practice
varies.
the
state
of
missouri,
we've
looked
at
this
issue
very
carefully
and
do
not
believe
that
using
the
actual
cost
method
will
increase
fees
or
increase
fee
litigation.
to
begin
with,
law
firms
normally
are
not
guaranteed
an
award
of
fees
in
any
fee-shifting
litigation.
therefore,
they
cannot
afford
to
assign
attorneys
to
do
paralegal
work
just
on
the
mere
possibility
that
they
will
prevail
and
receive
fees.
likewise,
the
most
senior
attorney
in
the
firm
is
not
going
to
be
doing
simple,
basic
legal
research
that
a
first-year
associate
can
do,
on
the
chance
that
the
higher
rate
can
be
recovered
some
time
down
the
road
if
they
prevail.
the
law
firm
is
going
to
continue
to
staff
a
particular
case
in
the
most
cost-effective
manner,
the
most
efficient
manner.
we
do
not
think
that
this
will
result
in
additional
fee
litigation
because
scrutiny
of
attorney
hours
and
paralegal
hours
already
exists.
courts
routinely
reduce
the
hourly
rate
of
eliminate
the
hours
entirely
if,
for
example,
senior
attorneys
are
doing
work
that
should
have
been
done
by
junior
attorneys.
if
junior
attorneys
are
doing
paralegal
work,
courts
routinely
reduce
the
hours
or
reduce--
mr.
bruce
farmer
--well,
the
record
isn't
clear
on
that,
your
honor.
a
law
clerk
may
be,
in
this
case,
someone
who
is
not
trained
as
a
paralegal.
the
district
court
also
included
fees
for
recent
law
graduates
who
are
not
yet
admitted
to
the
bar
who
also
worked
on
the
case.
the
whole
range
of
paraprofessionals
that
were
not
attorneys,
basically,
i've
lumped
into
one
category
of
paralegals
because
that's
what
they
are.
they're
not
attorneys,
they
can't
receive
attorneys'
fees,
so
therefore
the
fee
comes
under
the
paralegal.
courts
also
routinely
reduce
hours
or
eliminate
the
hours
if
paralegals
are
doing
clerical
work
that
should
be
considered
normal
office
overhead.
we
also
take
the
position
that
fee
litigation
may
actually
be
reduced,
because
the
dollars
at
stake
are
less.
and
that
thereby
reduces
the
incentive
to
litigate
the
fees,
particularly
when
everything
you
do
in
fee
litigation
just
generates
more
fees
for
the
prevailing
party.
now,
we
concede
that
congress
was
concerned
about
providing
for
reasonable
attorneys'
fees,
but
there
was
also
a
concern
in
congress
that
section
1988
not
result
in
windfall
to
attorneys
or
become
a
relief
fund
for
lawyers.
compensating
paralegals
at
a
market-based
rate
does
result
in
a
windfall,
particularly
in
this
case,
where
the
paralegals
were
hired
specifically
to
work
on
this
case.
mr.
bruce
farmer
we
believe
that
the
attorneys
are
treated
differently
under
the
statute.
it
specifically
refers
to
attorneys'
fees
and,
therefore,
the
attorneys'
fees
get
the
market-based
rate
because
that
also
includes
overhead
and
a
profit
figure.
the
other
category
in
the
statute,
cost
or
expenses,
is
treated
differently.
i'd
like
to
explore--
mr.
bruce
farmer
--separately
as
cost
or
expenses,
that's
correct.
mr.
bruce
farmer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
it
therefore
falls
into
the
second
category.
i'd
like
to
explore
this
rationale--
mr.
bruce
farmer
--well,
we
believe
it's
part
of
costs
and
expenses,
an
expense
to
the
lawyer
that
he
has
to
pay
for,
in,
concerning
the
particular
case.
if
i
can
give
you
an
example,
let's
just
take
it
one
tiny
step
further.
a
legal
secretary,
like
a
paralegal,
has
specialized
training,
in
some
cases
a
college
program.
is
that
also
the
type
of
expense
that
can
be
separated
out
and
billed
separately?
and
we're
talking
about
billing
separately
here,
not
at
an
actual
cost
method,
but
at
a
rate
four
or
five
times
the
actual
cost
to
the
attorney.
now,
again,
this
does
not
appear
to
be
a
widespread
practice
now;
maybe
mr.
topkis
can
address
that.
but
the
day
may
come
when
that
happens.
we
don't
believe
that
that
kind
of
concept
was
considered
by
congress
in
allowing
a
reasonable
attorneys'
fees
and
cost
and
expenses
under
section
1988.
we
recognize
that
it
is
one
thing
for
a
law
firm
to
bill
separately
for
those
items
on
the
basis
of
a
contractual
agreement
with
the
client's
consent.
but
we're
talking
about
fee-shifting
statutes,
which
congress
has
allowed
the
prevailing
party
to
pass
attorneys'
fees
and
costs
and
expenses
on
to
one's
opponent.
with
the
concerns
that
congress
had
about
windfall,
about
providing
for
reasonable
attorneys'
fees,
we
do
not
believe
there--
mr.
bruce
farmer
--well,
yeah,
it
was
not
included
in
what
the
judge
called
"costs",
but
it
was
included
separately
from
the
award
that
concerned
fees.
the
interesting
thing
about
that--
mr.
bruce
farmer
--pardon
me?
mr.
bruce
farmer
oh.
in
the
final
recalculation,
or
the
summary,
that's
correct.
but,
in
listing
that
way,
they
were
listed
separately.
mr.
bruce
farmer
the
interesting
thing
about
that
is
the
cases
relied
on
by
congress
in
enacting
section
1988,
the
one
case...
and
only
one
case
even
referred
to
law
clerk
fees
or
paralegal
fees...
that
is
listed
in
a
whole
string
of
items,
of
costs.
it's
listed
separately
from
attorneys'
fees
and
it's
not
in
its
own
separate
category;
it's
listed,
including
in
the
whole
string
of
items
of
costs.
so
that's
why
we
believe
that
in
treating
paralegal
fees,
under
the
statute,
it
should
be
at
an
actual
cost
method.
mr.
bruce
farmer
we
do
not
believe
it
will,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
farmer
that
is
certainly
a
possibility,
but
i
think
it's--
mr.
bruce
farmer
--well,
one
would
hope
that
what
you
do
say
makes
a
difference
in
the
practice
of
law.
[laughter]
we
do
not
believe
that
law
firms
are
going
to
be
treating
paralegals
any
differently
or
staffing
cases
differently.
to
speculate
that,
ultimately,
fee
awards
may
increase,
i
think,
just
cannot
be
shown
from
the
record
in
this
case
and
would
be
speculation
at
best.
mr.
bruce
farmer
yes,
but,
even
now,
those
kinds
of
hours
are
scrutinized
by
district
courts
in
fee
litigations,
so
if
attorneys
are
doing
paralegal
work,
the
hours,
district
courts
now
typically
reduce
or
eliminate
the
hours
entirely.
that's--
mr.
bruce
farmer
--well,
i
think
there's
a,
in
determining
whether
to
use
paralegals
or
an
attorney,
the
law
firm
must
staff
the
case
as
efficiently
as
possible.
in
deciding
what
compensation
to
require
one's
opponent
to
pay,
if
a
work
could
have
been
done
by
a
paralegal
but
was
instead
done
by
a
lawyer,
then
district
courts
should
reduce
the
fee
award
appropriately.
just
as
now,
if
work
is
done
by
a
junior
associate,
or
if
work
is
done
by
a
senior
attorney
that
could
have
been
done
by
a
junior
associate,
courts
routinely
reduce
those
fee
awards
on
that
basis.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
bruce
farmer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
just
briefly,
i'd
like
to
respond
to
mr.
topkis'
implication
that
i
picked
this
$15,
$20
rate
out
of
the
air.
in
the
district
court's
opinion,
on
page
a-28
of
the
petition,
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
cert,
the
court
says,
"the
court
notes
that
the
$80
per
hour
rate
is
approximately
$15
to
$20
higher
than
the
average
hourly
rate
for
kansas
city
associates
in
1982
to
1984.
"
now,
he's
talking
there
about
associates
of
mr.
benson,
but
he
did
specifically
find
that
the
hourly
rates
for
the
period
we're
talking
about
was
$15
to
$20
difference.
other
than
that,
there's
nothing
else
i
need
to
add
other
than
to
say
that,
in
terms
of
a
fiscal
impact
on
the
state
of
missouri,
the
part
of
missouri
i
come
from,
a
million
dollars
still
means
something,
so--
mr.
bruce
farmer
--your
honor,
it's
a
difficult
analysis--
mr.
bruce
farmer
--well,
we
think
you
should
go
as
far
as
we
want
to
take
you
in
this
case
because
it
is
almost
identical
to
the
situation
in
library
of
congress
v.
shaw.
in
that
case,
title
vii
waived
the
federal
government's
sovereign
immunity
for
attorneys'
fees
and
costs,
but
not
for
interest.
and,
similarly,
in
this
case,
while
section
1988
waives
11th
amendment
immunity
for
attorneys'
fees
and
costs,
but
also
not
interest.
and
hutto
v.
finney
applies
section
1988
to
the
states,
but
even
hutto
recognizes
that
if
you
expand
the
traditional
concept
of
costs,
then
that
analysis
would
not
apply.
i'm
not
sure
there's
any
easy
answer
to
your
question.
it's
a
difficult
analysis,
but
i
think
in
this
case
the
principles
in
shaw
are
completely
applicable
to
the
11th
amendment
context.
