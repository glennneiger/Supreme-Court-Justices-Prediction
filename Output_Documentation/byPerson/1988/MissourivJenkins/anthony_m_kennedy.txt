justice
kennedy
i
see.
your
position
is
that
the
attorney
is
fully
compensated
in
economic
terms
when
just
the
bare
fee,
without
any
addition
for
delay
in
payment,
is
the
award?
justice
kennedy
well,
another
way
of
saying
it
is
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee,
in
your
view,
is
less
than
full
compensation
for
the
attorney's
time
reasonably
expended.
justice
kennedy
so
your
position
is
that
a
reasonable
fee
is
less
than
full
and
fair
compensation.
justice
kennedy
your
position
is
that
our
decision
will
not
affect
the
way
attorneys
use
paralegals
in
their
practice,
in
these
cases?
justice
kennedy
if
you're
wrong
about
that,
then
your
position
means
that
the
cost,
or
the
legal
bill
may
ultimately
be
more
because
attorneys
will
be
used
instead
of
paralegals.
justice
kennedy
so
a
large
part
of
your
argument
seems
to
rest
on
a
judgment
as
to
whether
or
not
what
we
say
makes
any
difference
to
the
practice
of
law
in
these
cases.
justice
kennedy
well,
if
attorney
are
used
in
lieu
of
paralegals,
then
it
clearly
will
increase
the
size
of
the
awards.
justice
kennedy
so
you
think
there
should
be
a
legal
requirement
that
paralegals
be
used?
justice
kennedy
what
are
those?
justice
kennedy
well,
is
there
any
instance
in
which
it's
more?
