justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
87-1555,
james
j.
burnley
v.
labor
railway
labor
executives'
association.
mr.
attorney
general,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
attorney
general,
the
ninth
circuit
majority,
as
i
read
their
opinion,
said
that
the
regulated
industry
example
didn't
apply
here
because
the
railroad
regulations
were
basically
were
for
the
benefit
of
employees.
and
they...
they
thought
that
our
other
regulated
industry
cases
depended
on
the
fact
that
the
industry
itself
was
regulated
for
the
benefit
of
the
public.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
attorney
general.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
mann.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
none
of
the
courts
that
have
considered
this,
mr.
mann,
have...
even
the
ones
who
have
ruled
in
your
favor,
as...
as
the
ninth
circuit,
have
suggested
that
the
government
had
to
obtain
a
warrant.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
fourth
amendment
prohibits
unreasonable
searches,
so
the
test
is
reasonableness.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
any
reason
as
to
why
you
think--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--it
deters
more
than
the
government
program?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
can
see
why
those
were...
are
fairness
arguments,
but
i
can't
see
why
those
would
provide
more
deterrence
than
the
government
program.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
government
doesn't
rely
on
pure
consensual
basis
for
the...
for
the
upholding
of
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if...
if...
if
the
government
were
arguing
consent
and
it
were
right,
that
would
be
the
end
of
it.
you
wouldn't
look
into
the
reasonableness
and
so
forth.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mann.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
