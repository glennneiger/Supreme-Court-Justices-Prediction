well,
is
it
your
submission
that
all
of
those
employees
are
engaged
in
safety-sensitive
tasks?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does...
does
the
urine
test
show
alcohol
traces
for
a
longer...
at
all
and,
if
so,
for
a
longer
period
than
the
blood
would
show
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes
to
both
questions?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
the
urine
test
could
show
that
alcohol
had
been
used,
say,
four
or
five
days
previous?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
would
that
be
an
indication
that
the
impairment...
of
an
impairment
of
the
operator's
skills?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
your
position
that
the
public
has
no
interest
in
whether
or
not
railroad
employees
are
chronic
drug
users
so
long
as
the
drugs
are
not
used
while
they're
on
the
job?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
your
position?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so...
so
it...
so,
we
do
have
an
interest
in
knowing
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
isn't
one
of
the
reasons
we
want
to
know
that
because
there
is
a
likelihood
or
a
higher
probability
that
drugs
will
be
used
on
the
job
if
they're
used
off
the
job?
it's
just
that
simple.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could...
could
reasonable
people
disagree
on
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
then
it's
reasonable
for
the
government
to
take
the
position
that
they
do,
isn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
urine
test
is
better,
is
it
not,
for
demonstrating
traces
of
use
over
a
period
of
time?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
how
i
understand
the
record.
that's
a
fact,
isn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
isn't
urine
better
than
blood
for
establishing
residues
over
a
period
of,
say,
30
days?
it's
better.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
not
may
be
more
effective.
it
is
more
effective,
isn't
it,
for
that
purpose?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
the...
so,
the
greater
the
incidence
of...
of
drug
use,
the
less
need
for
a
test.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
think
particularized
suspicion
is
a
threshold
requirement
for
any
drug
testing
program?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
that
be
true
for
the
operator
of
a
nuclear
plant?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
have
the
opinion
for
the
court
in
skinner
versus
railway
labor
executives'
association,
and
in
national
treasury
employees'
union
versus
van
raab.
skinner
is
the
first
of
two
cases
we
decide
today
which
concerns
challenges
to
the
constitutionality
to
the
different
drug
testing
programs.
here,
the
federal
railroad
administration
promulgated
rules
that
require
railroads
after
major
train
accidents
or
incidents
occur
to
conduct
blood
and
urine
test
of
certain
employees
who
are
involved.
the
rules
were
promulgated
on
the
basis
of
evidence
indicating
an
alcohol
and
drug
abuse
by
railroad
employees
had
caused
to
contributed
to
a
number
of
significant
train
accidents.
respondents
who
are
an
executivesâ€™
association
and
various
labor
organizations
sought
to
enjoin
the
regulations,
but
the
district
court
upheld
them
fining
that
in
these
circumstances
the
test
did
not
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed,
one
judge
dissenting.
in
an
opinion
we
file
today,
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
and
uphold
the
testing
program.
we
conclude
first
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
apply
to
the
drug
and
alcohol
testing
established
under
these
regulations.
the
testing
is
not
purely
private
conduct
because
it
occurs
under
the
compulsion
of
government
regulations,
and
the
collection
and
analysis
of
the
blood
and
urine
samples
are
searches
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment
for
the
intrude
upon
expectations
of
privacy
that
our
society
has
long
recognized
as
protected.
nonetheless,
we
find
that
these
tests
are
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment
even
though
they
are
undertaken
without
a
warrant
and
without
individualized
suspicion.
the
regulation
served
compelling
governmental
interests
that
outweigh
the
privacy
concerns
of
these
employees.
employees
are
prohibited
from
using
alcohol
or
drugs
while
on
duty,
and
the
testing
program
helps
to
ensure
that
the
restrictions
are
observed.
requiring
a
warrant
before
testing
could
occur
would
be
of
little
value
here
since
the
circumstances
and
the
limits
of
the
intrusions
are
specifically
defined
and
well-known
to
the
employees
covered
by
the
program
which
also
vest
minimal
discretion
in
the
officials
who
administered.
and
the
warrant
requirement
would
significantly
hinder
the
purposes
of
the
program
since
the
delay
needed
to
get
a
warrant
could
allow
the
destruction
of
valuable
evidence
as
alcohol
and
drugs
leave
the
bloodstream
during
that
period.
finally,
individualized
suspicion
is
not
necessary
here
to
support
the
reason
of
list
of
the
testing
procedures.
the
railroad
industry
is
subject
to
pervasive
health
and
safety
regulations
and
the
affected
employees
already
have
consented
to
significant
restrictions
imposed
by
the
employers.
in
light
of
the
limited
discretion
exercised
by
the
railroad
employers
under
the
regulations,
the
surpassing
safety
interests
served
by
the
test
in
this
context
and
the
diminished
expectations
of
privacy
that
attached
to
information
pertaining
to
the
fitness
of
covered
employees,
we
believe
that
it
is
reasonable
to
conduct
such
tests
in
the
absence
of
the
warrant
or
of
suspicion
that
any
particular
employee
maybe
impaired.
we
hold
that
the
alcohol
and
drug
test
contemplated
by
the
regulations
are
reasonable
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment.
