mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
one
focus
that
i
want
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
is
that,
the
purpose
of
the
regulations
cannot
be
complied
with
under
the
scheme
that's
devised
in
the
federal
regulation
because...
and
i
read...
"the
purpose
of
this
part
is
to
prevent
accidents
and
casualties
in
railroad
operations
that
result
from
impairment
of
employees
by
alcohol
or
drugs.
"
the
record
is
clear
that
neither
the
alcohol
nor
the
drug
test
by
urine
nor
by
blood
can
demonstrate
impairment.
a
urine
test
only
can
show
the
metabolites
of
a
drug
that's
in
the
system.
and
in
the...
indeed,
in
the
regulation
itself,
the
federal
railroad
administration
recognizes
that
in
some
cases
it
can
remain
in
the
system
up
to
60
days.
now,
we
have
no
problems
in
the
railroad
unions
that
one
who
is
using
alcohol
or
drugs
should
not
be
working
in
the
railroad
system.
that's
not
the
issue
here.
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
one
in
his
sole
privacy
of
their
homes
60
days
ago
on
a
vacation
may
have
used
drugs...
i'm
not
suggesting
that
we
condone
it,
but
the
mere
fact
that
they
used
drugs
does
not
in
any
way
have
any
nexus
that
while
that
employee
is
working
that
he
or
she
may
have
used
drugs
on
the
job
because
the
tests
don't
demonstrate
it.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
no,
justice
o'connor.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the...
the
blood
test
can
show
relatively
recent
usage.
what
it
cannot
demonstrate
is
that
the
person
is
impaired.
and
that's
what
the
purpose
of
this
rule
is,
to
prevent
impairment.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
it
can.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
yes.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
yes,
and
the
alcohol--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
in
the
drug
area,
it
can
show
an
active
ingredient
in
the
blood
system,
yes.
but
it
points
out
the
fact,
however,
that
the
urine
test
for
metabolites
is
useless
test
because
it
doesn't
demonstrate
anything
different
from
what
a
blood
test
would
demonstrate.
and
the
mere
fact
that
it
remains
in
the
system
for
such
a
long
period
of
time,
at
the
very
minimum,
it
stays
in
the
system
several
days
even
one
ingestion
of
a
drug.
so,
what
is
to
prevent...
what
makes
it
impracticable
under
your
standards
of
griffin,
as
an
example?
what
makes
it
impracticable
for
the
government
to
seek
a
warrant
when
they
are
going
to
attempt
to
have
a
urine
test?
absolutely
nothing
because
the
metabolite
will
always
be
in
that
body
system.
it
will
be
there
no
matter
how
long
it's
going
to
take
to
go
to
some
neutral
person
to
seek
a
warrant.
now,
with
respect--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--they
did
not.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
i'm
suggesting
that
there's
nothing
that
would
make
it
impracticable.
that
is
the
standard...
you
have
said
that
it
would
be
impracticable
to
obtain
one--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--that's
correct.
and
in
this
case
we're
saying
it
is
unreasonable
for...
for
one
basic
purpose.
it
cannot
demonstrate
what
the
rule
was
intended
to
accomplish,
that
is,
impairment
particularly
with
urine
testing.
but
that
doesn't--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--your
honor,
it
seems
that
the
proper
focus
would
be
using
alcohol
or
drugs
on
the
job.
and
the
urine
test
can't
demonstrate
anything
with
respect
to--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--usage
on
the
job.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
i
don't
think
that
follows
necessarily.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
not
necessarily.
a
person
who
is
not
concerned
about
being
involved
in
an
accident
is
not
going
to
be
concerned
about
use
of
drugs
or
not.
that...
i
don't
think
it
follows.
it
can
follow,
of
course,
and
it
does
happen.
obviously,
it
happens.
but
the
urine
test
doesn't
demonstrate...
the
only
thing
that
urine
does
is
shows
a
metabolite.
it
can't
determine
how
much
you
use,
when
you
use
it
or
the
effects.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
i
think
it--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--i
think
it's
certainly
the
interest
of
the
government
to
know
who
uses
drugs
and
when,
but
there
are
other
means
to
determine
that.
for
example,
in...
in
the--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--yes,
i
think--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--well,
that
conclusion
i
don't
necessarily
agree
with,
sir.
the
reason
i
don't
is
because--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--i
think
so--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--that
is
certainly
what
the
government
has
done
in
this
case.
they
have
made
that
determination.
but
it...
it...
it
begs
the
question
what
they
are
attempting
to
accomplish.
how
they're
going
about
it
accomplishes
that
result.
and
we
don't
think
it
does.
it
does
with
respect
to
blood
because
it
can
show
a
relatively
recent
active
usage,
but
not
with
respect
to
urine.
and
the
urine
doesn't
show
anything
that
the
blood
test
would
not
reveal.
the
blood
test
reveals
both
active
ingredient
and
metabolites.
the
urine
test
only
shows
metabolites.
it
cannot
demonstrate
any...
any
active
usage.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
it's
the--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--it
is
an
equal
concern,
justice
o'connor,
but
the
concern
should
be
not
what
one
does
in
their
privacy
of
their
home.
the
concern
should
be
what
one
does
on
the
job
and
the
effects
on
the
job.
and
that
can
be
determined.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
yes.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
that's
correct,
and
we
agree
with
that.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
i
don't
think
it's
less
intrusive,
no.
i
think
the
intrusiveness
of
blood
is
more
so
than
urine,
but--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--no,
i'm
not
saying
that.
i'm
just
pointing
out
to
the
court
what
one
can
show
and
what
one
can't.
and
in
urine,
you
can't
demonstrate
any
recent
usage.
that's
the
problem
with
the
urine
test.
with
the
blood
test,
at
least
you
can
determine
relatively
recent
usage.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
it
can--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--well,
so
can
blood,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
it
may
be
more
effective,
but
the
blood
tests
can
also
demonstrate
that
by
the
fact
that
in
the
measurement--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--i
don't
think
i
can
honestly
answer
that,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
well--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--your
honor,
i
think
that--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--well,
i
think
the
court
could
reach
a
decision
that
because--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--well,
i
aim
at
both--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--i
do
believe
that
the
court
could
draw
a
distinction.
i
think
they're
both--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--bad
because--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--no,
sir.
i
want
you
to
say
that
they're
both
improper.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
i
think
they're
both
improper.
i
just
wanted
to
demonstrate
to
the
court
what
the
distinction
is
between
the
two.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
the...
the
whole
concept
of
the
drug
test
and
the
alcohol
test
here
is
reasonableness
and
fairness.
for
example,
the...
the
tests
are
performed
by
companies
that
are
not
certified.
these
drug
companies...
and
it's
an
absolute
essential
that
whoever
performs
these
tests
that
they
do
be
certified.
the...
the
federal
regulations,
as
they
apply
to
the
federal
government
testing
program,
does
require
certified
laboratories
in
accordance
with
the
national
institutes
on
drug
abuse.
this
regulation
doesn't
provide
that.
that's
one
aspect
of
the
reasonableness.
another
is--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--no,
sir.
i
think
that
it
is
one
of
the
factors
in
determining
what
privacy
rights
are
invaded,
and--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--it
is
just
one
of
the
factors
to
show
that--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--because
if...
in
our
judgment,
if
the
test
is
not
valid
and
the
consequences
which
flow
from
that
could
be
criminal
prosecution,
it
goes
to
the
invasiveness
of
this
test
and
it
goes
to
the
overall
reasonableness
of
the
testing
program.
and
that
relates
to
whether
or
not
the
search
in
this
case
is
reasonable
or
unreasonable
and
the
consequences
that
apply
and
affect
the
employee.
and
that's
one
factor.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
i
think
it
does...
in
this
case
it's
not
designed
to
determine
that
because
we're
only
talking
about
a
microcosm
of
accidents.
last
year
and
the
year
before,
we've
had
two
years
now
of
history.
last
year
there
were
170
events
which
triggered
a
test.
in
the
railroad
industry,
there
are
over
14,000
accidents
or
incidents
each
year.
so,
this
is
only
170
that
they're
looking
at.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
that
is
not
where
the
most
people
are
killed,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
pardon
me?
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
it's
the
least
area
where
someone
is
killed
in
the
railroad
industry.
the
most
people
who
are
killed
in
the
railroad
industry
are
at
grade
crossings.
that's
completely
exempt
from
this
regulation.
there
were
5,000--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--it
does,
but
that
gravity
is
so
small
that
it
doesn't
show
the
causes
of
accidents
in
the
railroad
industry.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
it
would
certainly
be
more
valid
as
far
as
statistical
data
goes.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
as
to
the...
as
to
the
data
gathering,
it
would
have
more
reliability
and
validity.
but
here
we're
only
talking
about
170
events.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
in...
in
many,
that's
true,
your
honor.
but
that's
one
aspect.
now,
the
other
is--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--it
is.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
but
they
don't
have--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--oh,
you
have
close
to
2,000.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
well,
we
don't
know
as
it
relates
to
alcohol
or
drugs.
the
point
is
that
the
government's
rationale
for
the
governmental
interest
here
is
deterrence,
on
one
hand,
and
secondly,
the
statistical
data
that
they
will
get.
but
it
really
is
insignificant,
and
it's
minimal...
the
statistical
data
part
of
it.
with
respect
to
deterrence,
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
the
first
10
months
when
this
rule
was
operative
in
1986,
there
were
3.7
percent
found
to
be
positive
for
drugs.
in
1987,
it
increased
to
5.1
percent.
for
the
first
six
months
of
this
year,
it's
6.5
percent
which
points
out
that,
indeed,
this
is
not
a
deterrent,
this
rule,
because
it's
not...
it's
not
focused
and
it's
not
directed
to
the
real
problem.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
no.
i'm...
i'm
saying,
your
honor,
that
the
basis
of
the
government's
rule
is
that
this
would
be
a
deterrent,
this
regulation.
now,
the
gut...
your
gut
feeling
would
be,
sure,
anything
that's
going
to...
urine,
a
blood
test
would
be
a
deterrent.
but
the
facts
are
that
this
rule
is
not
getting
at
the
problem.
and
on...
a
comparison
is
that
we
have
in
the
railroad
industry
a
program
whereby
all
of
these
tests
that
are
provided
in
the
federal
rule
plus
additional
testing
after
certain
accidents
and
incidents
are
carried
out.
on
the
csx
system,
as
an
example,
which
is
the
largest
railroad
in
the
country,
they
perform
exactly
the
same
tests
as
the
federal
rule
plus
additional
testing.
and
under
that
program,
which
is
a
fair
and
balanced
program,
it
shows
3.2
percent
positive
throughout
the
system.
now,
that
is
an
effective
deterrent
program.
and--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--yes.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
i
don't
believe
that
this
program
of
the
federal
government
is
directed
at
the
real
problem
areas,
first
of
all.
secondly,
it
is
a...
a
program
which
builds
in
several
components
that
is
not
here
in
this
case.
one
is
there
is
an
opportunity
for
rehabilitation.
the
quality
of
the
laboratories
are
stringently
watched.
the--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--well,
the...
the
workers
realize
that
if
we
have
a
fair
program,
they
are
involved
in
it.
they
are
involved
in
this
program
from
every
level.
and
by
being
involved,
they
assist
in
assuring
that
on
this
railroad,
since
it
is
a
voluntary
program,
that
the
problem
will
be
erased.
and,
indeed,
it
has
been
effectively
erased
on
the
csx
system.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
it...
it's
much
broader,
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
it
covers...
it
covers
those
employees
who
are...
who
have
actually
entered
into
an
agreement
with
the
railroad.
but,
in
addition,
the
railroad
automatically
extends
this
to
every
person
in
the
railroad
system.
and
that
is
not
the
case--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--oh,
well,
how
it
works--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--i
have
an
argument
that
the
rule
as
drafted
provides
that
the
entire
crew
is
tested.
there
is
no
discretion.
the
entire
crew
is
tested
automatically.
and--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--on--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--hours
of
service
act.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
but
let
me
give
you--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--well,
let
me--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--that's
not--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--that's
not
necessarily
accurate
because
if
they
are
performing
certain
work,
they
can
perform
dining
car
work
and
other
related
work,
and
that
would
bring
them
under
the
coverage
of
the
hours
of
service
act
on
that
train.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
to...
to...
not
necessarily...
well,
movement
in
the
very
general
term.
a
ticket
taker--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--that...
those
persons
who
move
locomotives
in
yards.
but
to
give
you
an
example,
on
the
amtrak
train
in
the
amtrak
accident
at
chase,
the...
the
ticket
takers
on
the
train...
they
were
subjected
to
testing.
now,
they're
hours
of
service
employees.
they
are
not
involved
directly
in
the
movement
of
that
train
in
any
way,
shape
or
form.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
well,
we're
saying
it's--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--but
the
rule
is
broader.
it
covers
all
hours
of
service
employees,
but
they
don't
necessarily
have
to
be
involved
in
the
movement
of
the
train
at
the
time
of
an
accident.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
yes,
sir.
but
they're
not
all--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--no,
sir,
that
doesn't
follow
because--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--because
a
ticket
taker
on
an
amtrak
train
is
i
guess
theoretically
involved
in
the
movement
of
a
train
because
they
take
up
tickets.
they
are
covered
under
this
rule.
it's
just
too
broad.
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
what
caused
that
particular
accident.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
no,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
no.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
twelve
hours.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
yes.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
yes.
and
that's
the
purpose
of
that
law.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
yes.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
sure.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
they
don't
want
them
overworked,
your
honor,
which
is
a
good
law.
we
have
no
problem
with
the
hours
of
service
act.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
i
think
some
are,
yes.
i
think
the...
the
law
should
be
extended
to
other
employees
not
just
those
who
are
working
on
the
train.
it
should
be
extended
to
others.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
yes.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
that's
correct.
but
it
doesn't--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--not
on
its
face.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
but...
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
that
employee
was
involved
in
any
way
in
the
cause
of
the
accident.
we...
we
believe
that
when
you
look
at
the
entire
rule
and
how
it's
administered,
the
manner
of
the
test...
for
example,
the
testing
procedure
itself
is
one
urinates
under
the
direct
observation
of
a
technician.
and
we
think
that's
just
overly
broad
and
overly
reaching,
and
it's
unfair
the
way
that
people
are
treated
here.
they
are
herded
into...
all
of
the
crew
members
are
herded
into
an
atmosphere
of
tension,
first
of
all,
because
they
don't
know
whether
or
not
the
test
is
going
to
be
accurate
in
the
first
place,
and
if
it
shows
any
positive
residue...
and
you
have
to
understand
also
the
numbers
we're
talking
about.
we're
dealing...
marijuana
as
an
example
in
nanograms.
a
nanogram
is
one-billionth
of
a
gram.
and
if
it
shows
five
nanograms,
they
consider
that
to
be
positive.
there
are
no
thresholds
unlike
the
federal
regulations
that
deal
with
federal
employees.
there
are
threshold
limits
below
which
it
is
considered
to
be
negative,
a
negative
test
result.
here
it's.0001.
and
if
that
shows
any
kind
of
residue,
that
person
is
considered
to
be
impaired
by
the
regulation
and
they're
going
to
be
fired.
they're
fired
in
the
railroad
industry.
only
a
couple
railroads
provide
for
rehabilitation
unlike
what
the
attorney
general
stated
to
you.
so,
the
consequences
are
grave.
there's
no
assurances
that
the
test
results
are
going
to
be
accurate.
and
you...
you
have
to
deal
with
this
in
terms
of
what's
fair
and
reasonable.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
i
don't.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
no,
no,
not
on
tension,
but--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--but
that
is
one
of
the
aspects
in
my
judgment,
your
honor.
the...
the
testing
standards
are
such
that
it
triggers
both
psychological
intrusions,
which
this
court
has
held
to
be
one
of
the
factors,
as
well
as
physical
intrusions.
and
certainly
there
are
psychological
factors
involved
here
to
deal
with
what
intrusiveness
is
taking
place.
the
fact
that
you
are
subjected
to
these
kinds
of
procedures--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--yes.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
but
the
physical
examination,
your
honor...
if
someone
is
found
to
be
ill,
as
an
example,
they're
not
fired.
they're
given
an
opportunity
to
be
rehabilitated.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
here
they're
fired.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
no,
sir.
i'm
not
against
the
physical
examination.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
yes.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
it
does
include
a
urine
test.
and--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--it
does
from
pre-employment,
your
honor,
and
in
pre-employment--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--yes.
oh,
certainly.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
no
problem--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--because
it
was
consented
to.
it
was
freely
consented
to.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
that's
correct.
[laughter]
but
at
the
pre-employment
stage,
you
consent
to
that
condition
of
employment.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
the
existing
employees
have
not
consented
to
a
alcohol
and
drug
test
for
purposes
of
determining
usage.
that
is
not
what
they've
consented
to
when
they
were
first
hired.
they
are
imposing
a
condition
after
the
fact
on
the
employee.
and
that
goes
again
to
the...
to
the
aspects
of
voluntarily
consenting
to
an
unconstitutional
search.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
well,
your
honor,
you
have
a
case
pending
before
you,
which
you
have
accepted
cert
in,
conrail
v.
railway
labor
executives'
association,
in
this
term
which
you
will
be
hearing.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
yes.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
no.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
the
consensual
aspects,
your
honor,
whether
or
not
the
employee
has
consented
to
the...
the
invasion,
the
search.
and
we
contend
that
is
not
voluntary.
it
is
a
coerced
consent.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
they...
in
part
only.
they
mandate...
there's
a
mandated
implied
consent
in
the
regulation.
and
we
contend
that
obviously
is
improper
in
this
case
as
well.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
in...
in
michigan
v.--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--yes.
in
michigan
v.
clifford
and
taylor--
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
--you
said
that
the
fireman
can
go
on
the
scene
to
determine
the
cause
of
the
accident.
however,
where
it
goes
to
determining
a
violation
of
a...
of
a
rule
or
a
statute
or
regulation,
that
requires
probable
cause
or
at
least
particularized
suspicion.
and
that's
what
we
have
here.
it's
a
very
similar
situation.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
they
are
looking
for
violations.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
that's
what
we
believe
based
on
your
decision.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
well,
there
is
one
case,
your
honor,
the
rushton
case,
that
the
court
held
that
that
did
not
mandate
particularized
suspicion.
but
in
that
case,
there
were
no
sanctions
imposed
on
the
employee.
it
was
a
random
test.
the...
the
results
were
confidential.
there
were
many
factors
of
reasonableness
that
was
built
into
that
rule
that
is
absent
here.
and
the
same
thing
with
shoemaker.
in
shoemaker,
the
jockeys...
they
were
directly
regulated.
the
employees
are
not
directly
regulated
in
the
railroad
industry
by
statute.
only...
no
one
is
licensed.
only
the...
the
railroads
themselves
are
subjected
to
the
regulations.
and
only
recently
did
congress
say
that
the
federal
railroad
administration
had
to
license
engineers.
that's
still
not
in
effect,
but
it's
only
as
to
engineers.
moreover,
the
shoemaker
case...
in
the
first
instance,
there's
only
a
letter
warning.
secondly,
there's
rehabilitation.
and
thirdly,
only
after
three
events
of
positive
is
there
any
sanction
imposed.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
no,
the
physical
examinations
are
voluntarily
agreed
to
by
the
employee
periodically.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
yes,
sure.
they
have
to
be
fit.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
only
with
one
respect
difference,
and
that
is
this
is
an
invasive
search
seeking
to
have
one
fired;
whereas
the
medical
examination,
once
you're
rehabilitated,
you're
able
to
go
back
to
work,
and
you're
not
when
you
have
a
positive
blood
or
urine
test.
mr.
lawrence
m.
mann
thank
you.
