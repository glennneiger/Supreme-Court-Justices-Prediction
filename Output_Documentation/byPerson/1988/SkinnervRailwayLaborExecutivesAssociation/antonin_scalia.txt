justice
antonin
scalia
thank
you.
i'm
not
sure
i
followed
this.
now,
you're
saying
the
regulation
does
not
cover
dining
car
employees,
not
the
prohibition
on
use
of
alcohol.
you're
saying
the
testing
regulation
doesn't
cover
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
any
such
group
pointed
out
in
your
opponent's
briefs,
do
you
recall?
i
don't
recall
it.
i
guess
we
can
ask
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
it
can't
demonstrate
that
impairment
was
there
in
this
particular
accident
with
a
certainty.
but
certainly
someone
who
has
cocaine
traces,
or
however
that's
discovered,
in
the
urine
sample,
even
if
it's
shown
that
the
cocaine
was...
was
ingested
some
time
before,
sufficiently
before
that
you
can't
say
whether
there
was
impairment,
don't
you
think
it
is
reasonable
for
the
railroad
to
say
we
want
to
know
that
because
we
don't
want
someone
who
is
using
cocaine
to
be...
to
be
driving
the
train
next
time?
justice
antonin
scalia
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
not
someone
who
uses
cocaine
more
likely
to
use
it
on
the
job
than
someone
who
doesn't
use
cocaine?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't?
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
what
is...
i
don't
see
how
that
has
to
do
with
whether...
whether
my
privacy
has
been
unlawfully
and
excessively
invaded.
you
mean
if
my
privacy
is
invaded
by
a
good
scientist,
it's
okay,
but
if
it's
by
a
bad
scientist,
it's
not
any
good?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
how
so?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
factor
in
determining
whether
it's
a...
it's
a...
it's
a...
an
effective
program,
but
how
can
that
bear
upon
the...
the
degree
of
invasion
of
my
privacy?
justice
antonin
scalia
by
crew
you
mean
those
involved
in
movement
of
the
train.
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
--only
covers
those
involved
in
movement
of
the
train.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
would
not
be
dining
car
porters,
right,
and
would
not
be
sleeping
car
porters?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
right
or
wrong?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
does
not
include
those
people.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
related
work
would
have
to
be
work
related
to
the
movement
of
the
train.
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me...
let
me
read
you
what
the
hours
of
service
act
says.
"the
term
"employee"
means
an
individual
actually
engaged
in
or
connected
with
the
movement
of
any
train,
including
hostlers.
"
whatever
that
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
provision
of
the
federal...
you
ought
to
be
contesting
the
application
of
the
wage
and...
of
the
hours
of
service
act
to
those
employees
if
that's
the
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
surely
that's
a
different
issue.
i
mean,
we're
dealing
here,
though,
with
a
statute
that
says
you
have
to
be
engaged
in
or
connected
with
the
movement
of
any
train.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
rule
refers
to
the
definition...
the
rule
only
covers
people
covered
by
the
hours
of
service
act,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
only
covers
people
connected
with
the
movement
of
the
train.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't?
justice
antonin
scalia
then...
then
the
hours
of
service
act
is
too
broad.
the
hours
of
service
act
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
i
recall
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--says
that
you
can't
work
for...
it's
like
we
have
the
same
thing
for--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
airline
pilots
that
you
can't
work
an
excessive
period
of
time--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
it
would
be
dangerous.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that...
and
that
covers,
you
say,
conductors
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
there's
reason
to
cover
them
for
that,
i
guess
there's
reason
to
cover
them
for
drug
abuse
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
other
employees
can
be
overworked,
but
just
these--
justice
antonin
scalia
it
sounds...
it
sounds
to
me
like
you
have
a
good
breach
of
contract
claim
if
this
is
something
that
they
weren't...
that
wasn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
surely
that's
a
different
issue.
i
mean,
it's
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
seems
to
me
it's
not
an
invasion
of...
of
privacy
any
more
or
less
because
it's
a
breach
of
contract--
justice
antonin
scalia
--or
because
the
consequence
is
firing
rather
than...
rather
than
counseling,
or...
or
because
good
or
bad
scientists
are
used.
what
does
any
of
that
have
to
do
with
whether
it's
an
invasion
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mann,
what
about
the
physical
inspections
that
are
required
periodically?
is...
is
there...
does
there
have
to
be
a
particularized
suspicion
that
the
individual
is
ill
before
the...
the
physical
examination
can
be
required?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
keep
their
job.
justice
antonin
scalia
same
with
this.
