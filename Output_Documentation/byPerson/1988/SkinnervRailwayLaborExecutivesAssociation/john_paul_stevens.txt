mr.
attorney
general,
does
that
legislation
and
those
regulations
prohibit
the
use
of
alcohol
by
railroad
employees?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i'm
not
asking
about
the
testing.
i
mean,
just...
are...
are...
are
railroad
employees
forbidden
to
use
alcohol
the
night
before
they
get
on...
they
go
to
work?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
period
of
time
between
arrival
at
work
and
the
last
time
they
can
have
alcohol?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
governed
by--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it's
not
governed
by
regulation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
are
you
saying
that
if
the
regulation
reaches
employees
who
are
not
in
a
safety-sensitive
position,
then
it
would
be
invalid?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
just
say
you
don't
think
it
does--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
think
that's
part
of
your
opponent's
argument,
that
it's
broader
than
necessary
even
on
your
own
rationale.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
attorney
general,
on
that
point,
you
test
after
the
time
bomb
explodes,
which
is
one
of
the
problems
here.
and
the
major
accidents
that
you...
that
your
expert
cited
is
one
that
took
place
somewhere
in
maryland
killing
a
number
of
people
while
the
program
was
in
effect,
and
it
didn't
deter
that.
how
do
we
know
this
really
works?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
statistics
seem
to
show
there's
less
drug
use
in
the
last
couple
of
years
than
there
was
before
the
program
went
into
effect.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
accident
i
referred
to
certainly
doesn't
suggest
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
correct
that
the
principal
rationale
is
one
of
deterrence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
mr.
mann,
but
isn't
one
of
the
purposes
of
this
program
to
find
out
why
these
accidents
occur,
not
merely
deterrence?
that's
one
of
the
rationales
they
put
forward.
and
if
you
take
these
tests
and
you
find
negative
results,
you
can
at
least
rule
out
drug-relatedness
or
alcohol
for
a
significant
percentage
of
the
accidents.
isn't
it...
doesn't
it
have
an
informing
purpose
that
at
least
is
rational?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
[inaudible]
170
more
serious?
well,
is
it
the
more
serious
ones?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--can...
can
we
assume
for
purposes
of...
of
deciding
this
case
that
the
vast
bulk
of
the
employees
covered
by
this
rule
are
in
safety-sensitive
positions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
that--
--and--
--there
may
be
some
on
the
fringes,
but
we're
really
talking
about
safety-sensitive
[inaudible].
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
would
just
be
invalid
to
that
extent.
