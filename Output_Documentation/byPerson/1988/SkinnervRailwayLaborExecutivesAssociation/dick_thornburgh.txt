mr.
dick
thornburgh
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case
about
railway
safety,
about
the
need
to
protect
railroad
employees,
the
traveling
public
and
the
communities
through
which
railroads
travel
from
the
hazards
created
by
the
use
of
drugs
and
alcohol
by
those
in
charge
of
trains,
and
from
the
risks
posed
by
their
impairment.
the
case
involves
the
legality
of
testing
for
the
presence
of
drugs
and
alcohol
among
railroad
employees
while
on
duty
and,
in
particular,
subsequent
to
certain
types
of
railroad
accidents.
the
american
railroad
industry
and
its
employees
have
a
long
history
of
safety
regulation
by
government,
beginning
with
the
safety
appliance
act
in
1893
running
through
the
comprehensive
railway
safety
act
of
1970
and
thereafter.
regulation
of
rolling
stock,
equipment,
track
and
signals
and
employees
has
been
authorized
to
protect
fellow
employees,
citizens
and
communities
throughout
the
united
states.
the
hours
of
service
act
in
1907
was
the
first
legislation
to
deal
with
employees
by
imposing
limits
on
the
number
of
hours
that
they
could
work.
that
legislation,
as
noted
by
this
court
in
language
we
suggest
to
be
equally
applicable
here,
was...
and
i
quote...
"induced
by
reason
of
the
many
casualties
in
railroad
transportation
which
resulted
from
requiring
the
discharge
of
arduous
duties
by
tired
and
exhausted
men
whose
power
of
service
and
energy
had
been
so
weakened
by
overwork
as
to
render
them
inattentive
to
duty
or
incapable
of
discharging
the
responsible
labors
of
their
positions.
"
the
1970
act--
mr.
dick
thornburgh
--the
1907
act
did
not
deal
with
that
problem,
and
i
would
propose
to
walk
us
through
briefly,
as
briefly
as
i
can,
what
led
up
to
what
i
submit
is
an
authority
to
carry
out
that
kind
of
testing--
mr.
dick
thornburgh
--they
are,
indeed,
by
operating
rules
adopted
by
nearly
all
railroads,
rule
g,
which
states
forth...
sets
forth
in
no
uncertain
terms
the
prohibition
against
working
or
showing
up
for
work
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
or
drugs
and
provides
for
dismissal
in
those
cases.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
that
would
be
a--
mr.
dick
thornburgh
--a
judgmental
matter.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
it
is
not
governed
by
regulation
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor,
no.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
yes,
operating
service
employees.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
i
can't
answer
that
because--
mr.
dick
thornburgh
--you
can
testify
no.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
i
will
accept
an
expert
witness'
testimony
on
that.
[laughter]
adopt
the
statement
by
mr.
justice
marshall.
well,
the
program
that
we
have
before
us
today...
would
that
include
the
dining
car
waiter?
it
would
include
all
in
the
operating
service,
yes.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
that's
my
understanding.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
yes.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
well,
specifically
and
most
importantly
those
charged
with
running
the
train.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
that's
my
understanding.
if
i'm
mistaken,
i
will
advise
the
court
otherwise.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
we
will
undertake
to--
mr.
dick
thornburgh
--we
will
undertake
to
tighten
down
on
that.
our
focus
understandably
is
on
those
persons
who
have
the
actual
manual...
literal
manual
control--
mr.
dick
thornburgh
--yes,
brakeman,
fireman,
yes.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
the
definition
is
under
the
hours
of
service
act,
which
includes
operating
employees...
and
i
stand
corrected
and
will
revert
to
the
practice
noticed
by
mr.
justice
marshall
that
dining
car
employees
are
not
covered
by
the
regulations--
mr.
dick
thornburgh
--the
hours
of
service
employees?
that's
the
basis
of
that
designation,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
no.
i'm
saying
that
the
hours
of
service
act
definition
does
not
cover
dining
car
employees
and
it
is
that
definition
upon
which
both
rule
g
and
the
regulations
here
at
issue
operate.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
pullman
car
employees.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
well,
the
thrust
and
the
focus
of
this
regulation
and
the
regulatory
scheme
that
has
been
generally
promulgated
with
regard
to
railroad
employees
relates
to
those
employees
that
have
a
clear
and
palpable
relationship
to
the
safety
of
the
protected
persons,
fellow
employees,
traveling
public,
citizens
and
communities
around
it.
i
am
not
going
to
palm
myself
off
on
this
court
as
an
expert
upon
where
that
line
is
drawn
because
i
think
the
essence
of
the
argument
that
the
government
is
making
here
on
behalf
of
the
federal
railway
administration
is
that
what
has
been
promulgated
meets
the
needs
of
protecting
those
designated
classes
of
persons.
i
would
agree
in
the
premise
that
underlies
the
questions
that
if
there
is
a
spare
category
out
there
that
has
no
relationship
whatsoever
to
the
safety
of
those
individuals
or
classes
of
persons,
that
it
would
be
an
overreaching.
i
am
not
aware
that
there
is
such
a
category,
however.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
no.
i--
mr.
dick
thornburgh
--again,
with
respect
to
those
employees,
there
might
be
a...
a
question.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
well,
i
think
when
you
look
at
the
regulation
in
its
gross
operation...
and
again,
i...
i
don't
want
to
represent
to
this
court
that
there
may
not
be
somewhere
out
there
an
employee
or
two
or
category
that
has...
with
respect
to
which
your
honor's
concerns
might
be
justified.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
given
the
extensive
review
process
that
was
undertaken
in
the
promulgation
of
this
legislation
by
those
who
are
far
more
expert
than
i
and
most
of
this
court
probably
in
the
categories
that
have
a
direct
relationship
to
safety,
i
know
of
no
such
group
that
is...
with
respect
there
may
be
an
overreaching
taking
place.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
i
don't,
but
i
suspect
that
my
opponent
will
scour
his
brief
for
such
a
designation.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
certainly.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
they
could
be
used
in
either
civil
or
criminal
proceedings.
there
is
no
bar
under
the
statute.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
i
don't
think
so
because
what
you're
dealing
with
here
is
not
some
ruse
to
carry
on
a
criminal
investigation
under
the
guise
of
an
administrative
proceeding,
but
a
set
of
regulations
that
has
an
independent
rationale
and
an
independent
basis
for
carrying
out
the
responsibilities
of
the
federal
railway
administration
to
investigate
accidents
and
to
enforce
the
rules
that
are
promulgated
against
drug
and
alcohol
abuse.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
that
is
one
of
a
number
of
purposes
that
are
identified
in
the
regulations
deriving
their
authority
from
the
railway
safety
act.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
i
don't
know
that
it
necessarily
would,
your
honor,
because
the
purpose
and
focus
of
the
fra,
as
your
honor
suggests,
is
toward
the
safety
portion
of
the
act
which
obviously
would
be
enhanced
by
removing
or
in
some
cases
rehabilitating
through
programs
that
the
railroads
carry
out
those
employees
who
have
drug
and
alcohol
problems.
it
is
not
a--
mr.
dick
thornburgh
--law
enforcement
criminal
undertaking
that--
mr.
dick
thornburgh
--no,
there
aren't.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
and
my
suggestion
is
that
that
is
a
concern
that
is
not
before
the
court
in
this
case
if
the
court
accepts
the
designation
that
has
been
adopted
all
the
way
through
of
the
concern
about
railway
safety,
which
doesn't
necessarily
turn
upon
the
civil
or
criminal
exposure
of
any
individual
using,
abusing
or
being
under
the
influence
of
drugs
or
alcohol.
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
basis
for
the
federal
railway
administration's
adoption
for
these
regulations
because
i
think
it
etches
the
severity
of
the
problem
in
a
way
that
indicates
the
reasonableness
of
the
response.
in
the
hearings
held
with
respect
to
these
regulations,
or
what
culminated
in
these
regulations,
the
fra
found
that
alcohol
and
drug
impairment
had
contributed
to
a
number
of
accidents
and
fatalities.
from
1975
to
1983,
at
least
45
train
accidents
and
incidents
that
involved
some
34
fatalities,
66
non-fatal
injuries,
and
$28
million
in
property
damage.
they
further
noted
that
these
figures
were
likely
to
be
understated
due
to
what
they
identified
as
a
conspiracy
of
silence
resulting
from
the
fear
of
employees
to
come
forward
on
account
of
their
concern
about
tort
liability
or
the
loss
of
the
job
if
accurate
reporting
was
forthcoming.
all
of
this
existed...
these
conditions
and
these
difficulties...
despite
the
existence
for
decades
of
operating
rule
g
referred
to
before
which
literally
prohibits
employees
from
using,
possessing
or
being
under
the
influence
of
drugs
or
alcohol
while
on
duty
and
subjecting
them
to
dismissal
for
violation.
the
procedures
adopted
are
two
in
number:
one
mandatory
on
all
railroads,
and
the
other
optional.
i
think
it's
significant
to
note
that
the
regulations
did
not
call
for
the
testing
of
all
employees
or
for
periodic
random
testing
procedures.
they
were
tied
instead
to
specific
events
and
particular
groups
of
employees,
both
defined
by
objective
standards.
subpart
c
mandates
the
taking
of
blood
and
urine
samples
from
covered
employees
in
three
instances:
first,
following
a
major
train
accident,
that
is,
one
involving
a
fatality,
the
release
of
hazardous
material
accompanied
by
evacuation
or
a
reportable
injury,
or
damage
to
railroad
property
exceeding
a
half
a
million
dollars;
secondly,
an
impact
accident
resulting
in
a
reportable
injury
or
damages
to
railroad
property
exceeding
$50,000;
and
third,
a
fatality
to
an
on-duty
railroad
employee.
the
samples
are
to
be
taken
as
soon
as
possible
at
an
independent
medical
facility
and
subjected
to
laboratory
analysis
using
state
of
the
art
methods.
the
employees
are
to
be
notified
of
results
and
given
an
opportunity
to
respond.
if
they
refuse
to
submit
to
a
test,
they
are
taken
out
of
service
for
nine
months.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
that's
under
subpart
c
required,
yes.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
the
urine
tests
act
as
a
preliminary
screening
process
because
of
their
propensity
to
reach
back
over
a
period
of
up
to
30
days
to
identify
those
who
might
be
habitual
users.
and
that
would
mean
that
if
someone
had
no
substance
in
the
urine,
that
they
would
not
have
to
go
forward
with
the
blood
test.
the
blood
test,
after
the
urine
test,
identifies
someone
as
a
user
of
drugs
or
alcohol
over
a
period
of
time
can
make
a
determination
as
to
current
disability
so
that
in
the
one
case
the
urine
test
narrows
the
field
of
concern
to
those
employees
who
have
used
drugs
at
some
time.
the
blood
test
is
able
to
target
those
who
are
currently
impaired.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
the
sequence
would
be
the
urine
test
and
then
the
blood
test
for
the
reasons
indicated.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
yes.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
as
accurate
as
can
be.
it
represents
the
state
of
the
art
and
the
technology
we
have
today
to
determine--
mr.
dick
thornburgh
--excuse
me?
mr.
dick
thornburgh
nothing
is
perfect
in
this
imperfect
world,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
dick
thornburgh
--i
think
you'd
get
differing
assessments
on
that.
it
is
a
recognized,
medically
and
scientifically
recognized,
method
of
determining
the
presence
of
drug
and
alcohol
in
the
blood
or
in
the
urine,
both
of
these
tests.
they
have
been
used
and
recognized
for
a
considerable
period
of
time.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
yes.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
yes.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
yes.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
not
necessarily,
but
it
would
operate
as
a
flag
that
further
inquiry
was
justified
and
should
be
undertaken.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
i
can't
answer
that
quantitatively,
but
clearly
it's
recognized
as
a
more
current
indicator
of
use
or
impairment.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
that's
my
understanding.
again,
i...
i
have
to
beg
off
somewhat
on
the
technical
precision
with
which
that
can
be
established,
but
it
is
the
basis
for
using
blood
tests
in
a
whole
variety
of
cases
that
have
been
before
this
court
at
one
time
or
another.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
well,
in
trouble
is
not
the
conclusion
that
i
would
append
to
that
observations,
your
honor.
i
think
what
it
would
be
was
an
aid,
an
indicator,
in
trying
to
determine
the
cause
of
the
accident.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
not
necessarily.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
no.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
no,
it
would
not
be.
and
i
think
the
point
about
these
tests
is
they
have
to
be
viewed
in
the
context
of
the
totality
of
the
investigative
process
that's
going
forward.
the
process
that
the
fra
is
charged
by
law
with
carrying
out
is
to
determine
the
cause
of
accidents.
in
the
case
where
those
accidents
are
not
related
to
drug
or
alcohol
abuse,
the
tests
in
question
would
provide
a
degree
of
assurance
that
some
other
kind
of
cause
related
to
the
accident
in
question.
in
the
case
where
drug
or
alcohol
abuse
shows
up
in
one
or
more
of
the
covered
employees,
then
further
investigation
and
the
accumulation
of
observations
that
may
have
been
made
contemporaneously
would
be
suggested.
but
as
in
any
case
where
evidence
is
divined
to
produce
a
conclusion,
the
process
is
uncertain
and
cumulative
in
its
nature.
subpart...
the
other
subpart
of
the
regulations
is
a...
it
permits
the
railroad
to
do
more
than
required
in
part
c
and
involves
other
mixes
of
urine,
breath
and...
and
blood
tests.
these
regulations,
as
the
court
knows,
were
sought
to
be
enjoined.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
denying
same,
and
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
reversed.
that
brings
us
here
today.
and
i
would
like,
if
the
court
please,
to
move
to
a
discussion
of
what
we
suggest
are
the
relevant
questions
of
constitutional
law
that
are
involved
here.
under
the
fourth
amendment,
the
rights
of
people
to
be
secure
in
their
persons
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
is
not
to
be
violated.
in
the
normal
criminal
investigation
case,
both
probable
cause
and
a
warrant
are
generally
necessary
to
render
a
search
reasonable.
in
certain
criminal
and
most
non-criminal
cases,
neither
is
required
or
has
been
required
by
this
court.
the
circuit
court
found
neither
to
be
necessary
here.
and
we
would
urge
the
same
finding
on
this
court;
that
is,
this
is
not
a
case
where
probable
cause
or
a
warrant
are
necessary.
this
court
in
determining
the
reasonableness
of
searches
and
seizures
has
adopted
a
balancing
test
which
requires
balancing
the
intrusion
of
the
individual's
fourth
amendment
interests
against
the
promotion
of
legitimate
governmental
interests.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
apply
such
a
test.
it
found
instead
that
the
procedures
set
forth
in
the
regulations
were
deficient
because
they
failed
to
require
a
particularized
suspicion
as
a
trigger
for
the
testing
procedures
offering
the
observation...
and
i
quote...
that
"accidents,
incidents,
or
rule
violations
by
themselves
do
not
create
reasonable
grounds
for
suspecting
the
tests
will
demonstrate
alcohol
or
drug
impairment
in
any
one
railroad
employee
much
less
an
entire
train
crew.
"
a
conclusion
which
we
submit
assumes
much
of
what
is
in
issue.
the
circuit
court
reached
this
conclusion
because
of
its
mistaken
premise
that
finding
a
search
justified
at
its
inception
requires
a
determination
that
there
are
reasonable
grounds
for
suspecting
that
the
search
will
turn
up
the
evidence
sought.
the
court,
in
short,
failed
to
undertake
the
balancing
test
because
it
presumed
the
need
for
a
particularized
suspicion.
this
court
has
stated
that
the
fourth
amendment
protects
only
an
expectation
of
privacy
that
society
is
prepared
to
considerable
reasonable
and
that
what
is
reasonable
depends
upon
the
context
within
which
such
a
search
takes
place.
i
would
like
to
move
to
that
resolution
of
those
balancing
questions.
new
jersey
v.
t.l.o.
emphasizes
that
exceptions
to
the
requirement
of
individualized
suspicion
relied
upon
by
the
ninth
circuit
may
be

and
i

"where
the
privacy
interests
implicated
by
a
search
are
minimal
and
where
other
safeguards
are
available
to
assure
that
the
individual's
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
is
not
subject
to
the
discretion
of
the
officer
in
the
field.
"
in
applying
this
test
here,
first,
it's
readily
apparent
that
the
search
authorized
by
the
regulations
at
issue
manifestly
takes
place
in
an
atmosphere
of
diminished
expectations
of
the
privacy
of
the
employee.
they
take
place
in
the
context
of
an
ongoing
employment
relationship,
circumscribed
by
longstanding
concern
for
the
employee's
mental
and
physical
wellbeing.
they
take
place
during
employment
in
an
historically
highly
regulated
industry,
and
they
take
place
in
an
industry
which
has
a
history
of
imposing
health
and
fitness
requirements,
including
in
some
cases
the
taking
of
blood
and
urine
samples
and
testing
similar
to
that
prescribed
here.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
we
look
at
this
case
as
one
that
doesn't
necessarily
turn
on
the
regulated
industry
exemption,
but
which
focuses
on
the
balancing
test
enunciated
by
this
court.
and
in
so
doing,
in
looking
at
the
expectation
of
privacy
that
is
forthcoming
on
the
part
of
the
individual
employee,
must
look
at
the
characteristics
of
the
employment
relationship
and
of
the
history
of
the
regulation
of
that
relationship,
not
just
the
industry,
but
of
that
relationship,
for
whose
ever
benefit
that
may
be.
the
other
safeguards
in
the
test
from
t.l.o.
that
are
available
is
that
the
testing
is
not
of
a
random
kind
or
is
it
subject
to
the
discretion
of
supervisors
who
might
target
or
harass
particular
employees,
but
is
triggered
by
objective
events
and,
in
the
case
of
subpart
c,
is
required
of
all
covered
employees
involved
in
the
incident
in
question.
the
testing
must
take
place
as
soon
as
possible
at
an
independent
medical
facility
by
qualified
medical
personnel.
applying
the
second
part
of
the
balancing
test,
it
seems
clear
that
the
searches
carried
out
take
place
in
an
area
of
intense
governmental
interest.
the
public
needs
to
be
reassured
that
every
step
is
being
taken
to
ensure
the
safety
of
those
who
operate
these
trains.
and
with
the
increasing
frequency
of
the
carriage
of
hazardous
materials
over
the
nation's
railroads,
none
of
these
concerns
are
matters
of
little
consequences.
judge
alarcon
noted
below
in
dissent:
"an
idle
locomotive
sitting
in
the
roundhouse
is
harmless.
"
"it
becomes
lethal
when
operated
negligently
by
persons
who
are
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
or
drugs,
the
substantial
equivalents
of
time
bombs
endangering
the
lives
of
thousands.
"
it
might
be
asked
here
what
are
these
intrusive
tests
necessary
for?
why
can't
simple
personal
observation
exist?
i
would
suggest
the
record
indicates
that
this
has
been
tried
and
found
wanting
and
that
the--
mr.
dick
thornburgh
--no
suggestion
is
made
or
intended
that
this
program
is
the
fool-proof,
complete
answer
to
the
problem
of
railway
safety.
we're
still
dealing
with
human
beings
and
with
their
judgment
and
their
frailties
and
their
fallibilities.
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
this
is
a
reasonable
response
to
a
gradually
increasing
phenomenon
of
drug
and
alcohol
abuse
as
the
cause
of
major
rail
accidents.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
one
would
hope
that
this
program
has
contributed
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
nor
will
accidents
in
the
future
indicate
a
complete
prophylactic
effect
of
these
types
of
regulations.
we
are
focusing
we
hope
on
the
reasonableness
and
the
results
of
the
balancing
that
has
to
ensue--
mr.
dick
thornburgh
--i
think
there
are
more
than
deterrent
capabilities
present
here,
but
that
is
an
important
one.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
yes,
indeed.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
there
is
a
capability
through
relevant
collective
bargaining
agreements
to
terminate
those
individuals
or
suspend
them
or
to
rehabilitate
them
through
programs
that
have
been
adopted
by
most
of
the
major
railroads.
before
closing,
i
would
like
to
specifically
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
holding
in
shoemaker
where
the
court
found
warrantless
breath-o-lyzer
and
urine
tests
of
jockeys
to
be
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment
based
on
the
highly
regulated
nature
of
the
horse
racing
industry
and
its
employees
and
the
public
interest
and
the
integrity
of
horse
racing
and
the
revenues
it
produced
for
the
state
of
new
jersey.
surely
the
appropriateness
of
similar
tests
to
the
jockeys
of
these
mammoth,
high-speed
and
potentially
death-dealing
locomotives
and
other
rolling
stock
properly
described
by
judge
alarcon
as
time
bombs
must
be
beyond
doubt.
what
is
at
stake
here
is
not
the
public
interest
in
the
integrity
of
the
sport
of
kings,
as
in
shoemaker,
or
the
revenue
it
produces,
but
the
very
lives,
health,
safety
and
property
of
innocent
employees
and
citizens
and
of
whole
communities
through
which--
mr.
dick
thornburgh
--the
nation's
railroads
pass.
mr.
dick
thornburgh
thank
you,
your
honor.
