general,

mr.

eight
minutes
or
more
on
the
difference
between
the
urine
and
the
blood
tests.
you
have
to
win
on
both
of
them.
justice
thurgood

why
are
you
drawing
a
line?
justice
thurgood

i
mean,
can
you
win
on
just
one?
justice
thurgood

you
don't
aim
at
both
of
them.
justice

you
say
urine
is
bad,
and
the

time
you
say
blood
is
bad.
justice
thurgood

do
you
want
us
to?
justice
thurgood

us
to
draw
a
distinction?
justice
thurgood

can't
we
deal

it
without
tension?
justice
thurgood

do
you
think

the

have
to
get
physical
examinations
periodically?
justice

without
this
statute.
justice
thurgood

so,
getting
a
physical
examination
doesn't
give
them
tension,
does
it?
justice
thurgood

the
physical
examination
is
not
the
point.
you're
against
the
physical
examination.
justice
thurgood

you're
against
the
physical
examination
that
includes
a
urine
test.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
accurate?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
doesn't...
