justice
sandra

o'connor
general
thornburgh,
as
long
as
you're
interrupted,
may
i
change
the
focus
of
the--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--questioning
a
minute
to
inquire
about
what
happens
to
the
reports
that
are
received
after
the
drug
testing?
for
instance,
would
the
fra
turn
them
over
to
police
for
any
criminal
negligence
prosecutions?
what
happens
to...
to
the
evidence
that
is
gathered
in
these
drug
tests?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
that
raise
any
concerns
under
this
court's
holding
in
schmerber
that
the
evidence
gathered
after
the
crash
is
turned
over
for
a
subsequent
criminal
prosecution?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
the
purpose
to
discipline
the
employee
involved
and
get
them
out
of
the
business
of
operating
a
dangerous
instrumentality
while
under
the
influence
of
drugs?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
would
it
affect
that
goal
if
there
were
some
prohibition
against
turning
the
evidence
over
to
the
police
for
criminal
prosecution?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
as
this
particular
program
is
designed,
there
are
no
restrictions
on
turning
the
evidence
over
to
the
police
i
take
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
assert
that
a
blood
test
cannot
show
current
extent
of
impairment
from
alcohol
or
drugs?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
can't
it
show,
for
example,
blood
alcohol
content--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
the
person?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
doesn't
that
relate
to
impairment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
relevant
to
that
inquiry.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
in
the
drug
area?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
mann,
isn't
there
a
concern
about
use
of
drugs
even
if
it's
off-duty
hours
so
long
as
that
usage
might
impair
the
person's
capacity
to
operate
the
equipment
safely
when
he
is
on
the
job
or
she
is
on
the
job?
it
isn't
just
usage
of
the
drugs
while
on
the
job,
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
if
somebody
takes
a
drink
before
going
in
the
engine
of
the
train
or
has
a
shot
of
some
drug
immediately
before
or
soon
before,
that's
an
equal
concern,
is
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
concern
is
what
one
does
before
going
on
the
job
that
will
impair
the
ability
of
the
person
to
perform
the
job
safely.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
isn't
that
true?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
you
think
that
a...
the
taking
of...
the
physical
taking
of
blood
is
less
intrusive
than
a
urine
specimen?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
then
why
the
focus
on
a
blood
test
is
all
right,
but
not
a
urine
test?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
where
anyone
is
killed.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
where
anyone
is
killed.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
fact
is
the
regulation
does
purport
to
focus
on...
on
accidents
of
a
certain
demonstrated
degree
of
gravity.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
would
it
be
valid
if
they
extended
it
to
reach
every
accident?
is
that
the
point
you're
trying
to
make?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
if
they
took
more
tests,
then
it
would
be
somehow
more
reasonable.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
mann,
is
this
situation
analogous
at
all
to
the
situation
after
a
fire
where
we've
held
there
can
be
a
search
without
any--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--particularized
suspicion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
taylor,
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
think
particularized--
