justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
attorney
general,
what
employees
are
subject
to
that
prohibition?
trained
service
personnel,
for
example?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
would
that
include
the
dining
car
waiters?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
dining
car
waiters,
and--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--porters,
and--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--not
just
those
charged
with
running
the
train.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
others
as
well.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
it's
rather
important.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
least
it
is
for
me.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
engineer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
firemen.
there's
no
firemen
anymore.
that
sort
of
thing.
but
do
we
take
it
as
a
given
in
the
case
that
the
regulation
covers
some
employees
that
are
not
engaged
in
safety-sensitive
tasks?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
mr.
attorney
general,
i
gather
there
have
to
be
both
a
blood
test
and
a
urine
test.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
does
the
urine
test
produce
in
the
way
of
information
that
you
don't
get
from
the
blood
test?
why
do
you
need
both?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
you
take
both
tests,
do
you
not?
you
don't
take...
what's
the
sequence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
the
urine
test
produces
nothing,
you
still
give
the
blood
test.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
xxx
the
drug
was
used,
mr.
attorney
general?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
would
show
impairment
at
the
time
of
the
test,
would
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
a
broader
program
than
one
limited,
as
is
the
government
program,
to
post-accidents?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
broader
in
the
coverage
of
the
employees
as
well?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
mr.
mann,
do
you
make
any
argument
that
this
government
program
reaches
employees
like
dining
car
waiters
and
such?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
have
any
argument
that
this
goes
to
far
in
that
respect?
