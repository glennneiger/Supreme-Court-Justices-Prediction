well,
also
the
language
would
then
just
change
the
word
"defendant"
to
"witness",
because
the
witness
would
always
be
the
person
who
had
committed
the
crime,
against
who,
you
know
is
being
impeached.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
trouble
with
that,
of
course,
is
you
never
think
of
prejudice
to
a
witness.
you
talk
about
prejudice
to
the
parties
to
the
case,
normally.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
caldwell,
on
that
point,
i
know
it
is
clear
that
the
rules
are
applicable.
in
your
review
of
the
history,
was
there
any
discussion
at
all,
that
you
found,
of
the
possible
application
of
the
rule
in
a
civil
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
i
am
really
asking
is,
is
it
consistent
with
your
reading
of
the
legislative
history
that
everybody
was
thinking
about
criminal
cases
throughout
the
discussion
and
did
not
really
give
any
thought
to
the
civil
application?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
that,
but
the
problem,
that
triggered
the
reconsideration
was
a
criminal
case
and
it
is
clear
that
they
wanted
to
change
the
rule
in
criminal
cases.
i
am
just...
i
am
not...
i
don't
know
of
any
evidence,
one
way
or
the
other,
but
i
am
just
wondering
if
they
talked
about
the
civil
problem
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
after
the
die
was
pretty
well
cast,
yes.
