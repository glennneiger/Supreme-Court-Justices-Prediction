mr.
thomas
d.
caldwell,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
first
like
to
address
the
proposition
that
the
admission
of
the
plaintiff's
prior
conviction
in
this
case
was,
at
most,
harmless
error
and
therefore,
this
case
should
not
be
remanded,
regardless
of
the
decision
of
this
court
and
its
interpretation
of
rule
609.
mr.
thomas
d.
caldwell,
jr.
mr.
nealon
and
mr.
swartz,
who
are
sitting
next
to
me,
tried
it.
mr.
thomas
d.
caldwell,
jr.
it
is.
mr.
thomas
d.
caldwell,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
d.
caldwell,
jr.
justice
blackmun,
there
were
two
issues
in
this
case.
one
was--
mr.
thomas
d.
caldwell,
jr.
--no.
mr.
thomas
d.
caldwell,
jr.
yes.
mr.
thomas
d.
caldwell,
jr.
there
were
two
issues
in
the
case.
the
first
was
that
the
machine
was
defective
and
that
became
the
battle
of
the
experts.
the
second
defense
was
assumption
of
the
risk
which
is
recognized
as
a
defense
in
pennsylvania
in
a
products
case.
there
were
four
witnesses
who
testified
in
this
case.
and,
of
course,
we
knew
that
this
was
going
to
happen...
that
they
had
warned
the
plaintiff,
below,
not
to
attempt
to
stop
this
machine
in
the
method
in
which
he
did.
we
knew
that
he
was
going
to
testify
that
he
was
never
warned.
that
set
up
an
issue
of
credibility
only
as
to
really
one
of
the
four
aspects
of
this
case,
and
that
is
the
reason
it
was
introduced.
as
it
turned
out,
the
jury
never
reached
the
assumption
of
the
risk
question.
credibility
never
really
came
into
play.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
to
the
warning
on
the
machine,
which
is
really
the
only
part
of
the
defect...
the
defective
machine
that
the
plaintiff
testified
to,
the
record
contains
the
following:
"did
you
see
warning
stickers
on
the
machine?
"
"no".
"do
you
remember
anything
that
was
written
on
the
machine?
"
now,
that
evidence
given
by
the
plaintiff
below
was
never
contradicted
by
the
defendants.
it,
it
was
admitted
that
there
were
not
warnings
on
the
machine.
mr.
thomas
d.
caldwell,
jr.
because
of
the
element
in
the
case
of
assumption
of
the
risk
and
all
of
that
evidence
came
in.
the
plaintiff's
testimony
came
in
that
he
was
never
warned.
the
defendant
put
four
witnesses
on
the
stand
who
testified
in
some
detail
about
the
warnings
that
were
given
to
him.
mr.
thomas
d.
caldwell,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
that
is
so,
justice
blackmun.
there...
there...
the
rationale
of
the
exception
which
was
made
in
rule
609,
by
the
conference
committee,
was
guilty
of
one
crime,
guilty
of
another
and
that
is
why
the
criminal
defendant...
and
it
is
clear
in
this
case
that
the
only
person
who
was
going
to
take
the
stand
who
was
going
to
get
the
benefit
of
the
balancing
test--
mr.
thomas
d.
caldwell,
jr.
--that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
d.
caldwell,
jr.
there...
there
is
absolutely
but
the
conference
committee...
and
when
this
was
considered
by
the
advisory
committee
on
the
judiciary
committees
of
the
house
and
senate,
they
afforded
the
balancing
test
to
the
defendant
because
of
the
rationale
that
guilty
of
one
crime,
guilty
of
another.
mr.
thomas
d.
caldwell,
jr.
the
ruling
would
be
that
the
felony
or
any
crimen
falsi
under
609
is
admissible,
then
he
is
not
entitled
to
a
balancing
test.
mr.
thomas
d.
caldwell,
jr.
there
are
two
philosophical
arguments
that
can
be
made
here.
one,
which
was
made--
mr.
thomas
d.
caldwell,
jr.
--yes,
they
do
and
i
can
state
them
briefly,
justice
kennedy.
in
one
of
the
house
debates,
and
i
have
tried
to
condense
this,
the
theory
was
a
demonstrated
instance
of
willingness
to
engage
in
conduct
in
disregard
of
accepted
patterns
is
translatable
into...
into
a
willingness
to
give
false
testimony.
now,
judge
gibbs...
gibbons,
in
his
dissent
in
diggs,
said,
this
rule
mandates
the
admission
of
such
evidence
against
a
totally
disinterested
witness
as
to
whether
a
light
at
an
intersection
was
red
or
green.
and
that
was
the
philosophical
battle
that
was
fought
in
the
advisory
committee;
it
was
the
philosophical
battle
that
was
caught...
fought
in
the
judiciary
committee
of
the
house
and
the
senate
and
i
might
say
that
the
rule
that
this
court
promulgated
and
sent
to
congress
did
not
include
a
balancing
test.
and
so,
that
testimony,
clearly
under
this
court's
rule
would
have
been
admissible.
mr.
thomas
d.
caldwell,
jr.
it's...
it's...
it
can
impeach
a
witness
and
throughout
the
scheme
of
these
rules,
a
party
is
a
witness.
mr.
thomas
d.
caldwell,
jr.
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
is
not
entitled--
mr.
thomas
d.
caldwell,
jr.
--no,
in
a
civil
case,
he
is
not
entitled.
oh,
under
this
rule...
excuse
me.
a
defendant
in
a
civil
case,
if
the
rule
was
read
literally,
he
would
be
entitled
to
it.
our
position
is
that
the
congressional
record
is
clear
that
the
only
person
who
was
to
get
the
benefit
of
the
balancing
test
was
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
and
that
comes
through
very
clearly,
as
i
can
point
out
in
the
record.
mr.
thomas
d.
caldwell,
jr.
that...
that
is
our
answer,
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
thomas
d.
caldwell,
jr.
that
is
true.
mr.
thomas
d.
caldwell,
jr.
because
the
intent
of
congress
was
clear,
when
the
balancing
test
was
introduced,
which
did
not
happen
until
the
conference
committee
considered
the
bill
passed
by
the
house
and
the
bill
passed
by
the
senate,
neither
of
which
afforded
a
balancing
test
and
the
conference
committee
inserted
a
balancing
test:
and
in
its
report,
it
said
as
follows:
"such
evidence
should
only
be
excluded
where
it
presents
a
danger
of
improperly
influencing
the
outcome
of
a
trial
by
persuading
the
trier
of
fact
to
convict
the
defendant
on
the
basis
of
his
criminal
record.
"
now,
there
is
no
record
of
the
debates
in
the
conference
committee.
and
where
there
are...
there
is
a
great
record
in
regards
to
the
advisory
committee
and
the
senate
and
house
judiciary
committees,
there
is
a
one-page
record
of
the
conference
committee,
and
that
language
is
contained
in
there.
and
if
you
look
back
at
the
history
of
the
act,
you
will
find
that
this
court's
advisory
committee,
the
judiciary
committees,
all
considered,
at
one
time
or
another
extending
the
balance...
of
broadening
the
balancing
test
past
a
criminal
defendant.
and
the
advisory
committee
of
this
court...
both
the
houses,
the
house
and
the
senate
rejected
that
concept
until
the
conference
committee
inserted
that
language
in.
and
i
would
submit
that
when
it
says,
only
be
excluded
where
it
prevents
a
danger
of
convicting
the
defendant,
that
the
intent
of
the
legislature...
of
the
congress
is
clear.
mr.
thomas
d.
caldwell,
jr.
yes,
i
am
not
so
sure,
if
you
read
it...
and
i
don't
want
to
talk...
have
a
battle
of
semantics.
i
am
not
sure
that
when
you
read
it,
it
is
ambiguous,
but
certainly
when
you
go
to
implement...
it
sets
up
an
unfair
result
in
a
civil
case
and
therefore,
the
congressional
intent
must
be
carefully
considered.
that
is
correct.
if
i
may
return
to
harmless
error
argument
that
i
was
making...
the
instructions
of
the
court
were
very
thorough.
the
trial
court,
the
judge
said,
the
only
purpose
of
that
evidence
is
not
to
prejudice
him,
certainly.
it
is
only
to
give
you
all
the
information
that
you
are
entitled
to
have
in
determining
whether
or
not
that
witness
is
credible.
you
may
consider
that
evidence
when
you
evaluate
mr.
green's
testimony.
now,
in
regard
to
the
warning,
the
court
said...
and
that
is
a
part
of
the
product
defect,
case...
you
must
determine
if
book
company
gave
a
warning
and
whether
that
warning
was
adequate.
and
these
questions
must
be
evaluated
by
the
circumstances
that
existed
in
1965,
which
is
when
the
machine
left
the
manufacturer's
hand.
there
were
then
four
questions
submitted
to
the
jury.
the
first
question
is:
"has
the
plaintiff
shown
by
a
fair
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
that
the
extractor,
manufactured
by
the
defendant
in
1965,
was
defective
when
it
left
the
defendant's
control?
"
this,
of
course,
is
the
principal
question.
the
second
and
third
question,
had
to
do
with
the
nature
of
the
defect
and
causation.
the
fourth
question,
which
had
to
do
with
credibility,
said,
the
fourth
question
is:
"has
the
defendant
shown
by
a
fair
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
paul
green
appreciated
and
assumed
the
risk
which
caused
his
injury?
"
your
answer
to
that
is
yes
or
no.
now,
that
was
the
question,
the
only
question
that
bore
on
the
plaintiff's
credibility.
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
and
this
colloquy
ensued.
judge:
"has
the
plaintiff
shown
by
a
fair
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
the
extractor
manufactured
by
the
defendant
in
1965
was
defective,
when
it
left
the
plaintiff's
control?
"
the
foreman
answered
no.
i
would
therefore
submit
that
this
case
did
not
turn
on,
credibility
at
all
and
that
the
evidence
of
the
prior
conviction
would
not
have
been
prejudicial.
now,
i
would
now
like
to
turn
to
congressional
intent,
and
i
think
there
are
three
considerations
that
have
to
be
examined
in
considering
that.
now,
the
first
is
the
prior
rule.
the
second
is
the
forces
which
converged
on
formulating
these
rules
of
evidence,
and
the
third
is
the
enactment
of
a
rule
and
the
enactment
of
the
exception,
because
these
were
distinct
occurrences.
contrary
to
mr.
melillo's
view
of
this,
i
believe
that
it
is
clear
that
the
prior
rule
was
that
there
was
no
balancing
test.
the
advisory
committee
note
says,
the
weight
of
judicial
authority
has
been
to
allow
the
use
of
felonies,
generally,
without
regard
to
the
nature
of
the
particular
offense
and
of
crimen
falsi
without
regard
to
the
grade
of
the
offense.
in
one
of
the
congressional
committee's
report,
the
following
appears:
the
congressional...
the
conventional
view
and
hesitatingly
supported
by
wigmore
has
been
that
an
accused,
who
elects
to
take
the
stand,
is
subject
to
impeachment
as
a
witness,
including
impeachment
by
proof
of
conviction.
in
1961,
and
if
the
advisory
committee
was
appointed
and
for,
it
began
its
consideration
of
the
codification
of
the
rules
of
evidence.
in
1965,
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
decided
the
luck
case,
in
which
it
inserted
a
balancing
test
into
the
d.c.
rule,
which
made...
which
applied
the
traditional
rule...
that
is,
any
felony
and
any
grade
of
crime
crimen
falsi.
there
was
immediate
and
adverse
reaction
to
that
in
congress.
and
congress
amended
the
d.c.
act
and
took
out
the
word
"may"
and
inserted
the
word
"shall".
so
that
the
practice
in
the
district
of
columbia
is
under
the
traditional
rule,
and
there
is
no
balancing
test.
the
advisory
committee
submitted
its
report
to
congress,
and
it
was
considered
extensively
in
the
judiciary
commitees
of
the
house
and
senate.
there
is
a
report,
from
which
i
quote,
"almost
13
years
of
study
by
distinguished
judges,
members
of
congress,
lawyers
and
others
interested
in,
and
affected
by
the
administration
of
justice
in
the
federal
courts.
"
now,
the
petitioner
says
to
you,
well,
they
never
looked
at
the
civil
cases,
and
that
is
simply
borne
out
by
the
record.
the
senate
judiciary
committee
reported
out
a
balancing
test
as
to
all
witnesses.
that
was
rejected
in
the
final
version
by
the
senate.
the
bill
passed
by
the
senate
allowed
impeachment
by
the
introduction
of
conviction
of
a
crimen
falsi
crime,
or
any
other
crime,
if
the
imprisonment
was
in
excess
of
one
year.
and
that
was
the
recommendation
of
this
court
also
to
congress.
the
house
impeachment
was
only
as
to
crimen
falsi
crime.
in
the
conference
committee...
and
as
i
have
said
before...
there
is
a
scant
record,
but
the
one
record
which
is
clear,
is
that
they
used
the
word
"convict"
when
they
applied
the
balancing
to
the
defendant.
and,
as
i
have
stated
before,
all
of
the
bodies
that
were
looking
at
this
matter
considered
various
alternatives
and
all
of
those...
some
of
those
alternatives
would
have
allowed
the
balancing
test
to
be
applied
to
witnesses,
in
any
case.
and,
of
course,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
as
you
pointed
out,
under
rule
1101,
it
is
very
clear
that
these
rules
are
applicable
to
both
criminal
and
civil
cases.
mr.
thomas
d.
caldwell,
jr.
yes,
the
advisory
committee
considered...
well,
if
the
question
is,
did
they
use
the
word
"civil"--
mr.
thomas
d.
caldwell,
jr.
--absolutely
not.
mr.
thomas
d.
caldwell,
jr.
the
rule
had
been
uniformly
applied
for
many,
many
years
before
1961
to
both
civil
and
criminal.
mr.
thomas
d.
caldwell,
jr.
there
were
four
congressmen,
in
debates,
who
referred
to
the
fact
that
these
rules
are
going
to
apply
uniformly
to
both
civil
and
criminal
cases,
and
we
have
pointed
that
out,
i
believe.
we
have
pointed
that
out
in
our
brief--
mr.
thomas
d.
caldwell,
jr.
--and
that
is
what
judge
gibbons
characterized
as
four
snippets
of
legislative
history.
as
i
said--
mr.
thomas
d.
caldwell,
jr.
--i
am
not
aware,
justice
o'connor,
that
there
is--
mr.
thomas
d.
caldwell,
jr.
--i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
i
don't
know.
mr.
thomas
d.
caldwell,
jr.
as
i
said
before,
in
the
debates,
when
they
did
discuss
applying
the
balancing
test,
they
only
discussed
it
as
to
a
criminal
defendant
because
they
said
that
the
jury,
the
prejudice
of
the
jury
might
be
that
if
he
committed
one
crime,
that
he
would
commit
another.
in
this
instance
of
a
civil
plaintiff,
the
rationale
would
have
to
be
that
because
he
was
convicted
of
a
crime,
he
is
unworthy
of
a
verdict.
and
i
just
think
that
is
a
quantum
leap
and
that
it
is
not
applicable.
now,
in
regard
to
rule
403,
i
think
there
are
several
reasons,
or
three
reasons,
why
403
would
not
apply.
it
is,
of
course,
a
general
rule
and
the
note
or
the
comment
to
that
rule
set
a
guide
for
handling
situations
for
which
no
specific
rules
have
been
formulated.
it
differs
by
one
word
from
the
balancing
test
in
609.
the
word
is
"substantially".
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
they
wanted
403,
or
if
anyone
understood
that
403
was
going
to
apply
to
609,
that
they
could
have
saved
the
time
of
the
debates
in
regard
to
having
any
balancing
test
in
609.
where
it
must
fall,
i
believe,
however,
is
in
the
609(a)(1)
and
609(a)(2)
argument.
if
403
applies
to
609
(a)(1),
then
it
would
apply
to
609(a)(2).
now,
the
report
of
the
conference
committee
in
speaking
of
the
balancing
test,
given
to
a...
and
they
were
speaking
of
convicting
a...
defendant
in
a
criminal
case...
the
admission
of
prior
convictions
involving
dishonesty
and
false
statement
is
not
within
the
discretion
of
the
court.
such
convictions
are
particularly
probative
of
credibility
and
under
this
rule,
must
always
be
admitted.
so,
they
just
were
speaking
of
the
rule,
itself,
and
it
is
completely
illogical
to
say
that
it
applies
to
one
subject...
one
subsection
and
not
the
other.
the
other
problem
that
you
run
into
in
applying
403
to
this
rule
is
that
there
are
other
specific
rules.
and
if
you
apply
403
to
this
one,
then
you
have
to
look
at
every
other
rule
and
see
if
you
are
going
to
apply
403
to
that.
taking
from
the
petitioner's
brief,
the
reasons
that
are
set
forth
there
in
regard
to
his
interpretation
of
the
rule
is
that
it
should
not
vary
the
common
law,
except
to
the
extent
the
change
appears
clearly
in
the
language.
well,
this
rule
would
vary
the
common
law
as
it
existed
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
rule
so
far
as
the
federal
courts
are
concerned.
that
it
should
not
conflict
with
companion
statutes.
well,
the
only
other
companion
statute...
i
don't
know
if
it
is
a
companion
statute...
but
the
only
other
congressional
enactment
on
this
is
the
d.c.
statute,
and
that
has
no
balancing
test.
finally,
that
it
should
not
encourage
forum
shopping.
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
applying
the
balancing
test,
adding
more
broadly
than
the
statute
allows
really
does
encourage
forum
shopping
because
there
are
no
guidelines
really
set
forth
as
to
how
the
balancing
should
be
applied,
and
some
judges
are
going
to
apply
it
in
favor
of
admitting
evidence,
and
others
are
going
to
apply
it
in
favor
of
excluding
it.
finally,
it
replaces
uncertainty
with,
with
certainty.
judge
marris,
who
was
chairman
of
the
supreme
court
committee,
said,
"the
adoption
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
will
provide
clear,
precise
and
readily
available
rules
for
trial
judges
and
trial
lawyers
to
follow
which
will
be
uniformly
applicable
throughout
the
federal
judicial
system.
"
and,
of
course,
if
you
have
a
balancing
test,
you
are
going
to
wind
up
with
different
results.
the
justice
department
criticized
in
one
of
its
reports
to
the
committees,
the
balancing
test,
because
there
was
no
standard
for
the
trial
judge
to
follow.
mr.
thomas
d.
caldwell,
jr.
it
does.
it
does...
it
does
and
there
are
no
guidelines,
as
you
pointed
out,
there
are
no
guidelines,
nonetheless.
it...
i
might
also
point
out
to
this
court,
that
congressional
control
over
rules
of
evidence,
if
you
look
at
the
statutes
and
the
1971
act,
and
the
1975
act,
you
see
a
tightening
of
control
rather
than
one
of
relaxing
one
and
under,
of
course,
those
acts,
the
supreme
court
can
suggest
to
the
congress
what
the
rule
should
be.
thank
you.
