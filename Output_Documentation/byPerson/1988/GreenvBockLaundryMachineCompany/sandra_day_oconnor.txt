what
was
the
old
common
law
rule?
let
all
this
evidence
of
prior
convictions
in,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
take
the
position
that
rule
403
is
applicable?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
say
that
rule
403
applies
even
in
a
criminal
case,
where
the
prior
felony
is
one
of
honesty?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
rule
(2)...
i
mean
number
(2),
seems
to
just
be
an
exception
to
the
exception
for
criminal
cases.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
first
exception
to
rule
609(a)
deals
apparently
with
criminal
defendants.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
says
that
you
will
limit
the
types
of
crimes
or
the
evidence
of
prior
crimes
as
against
criminal
defendants
in
a
criminal
case.
but
section...
part
(2)
says
that
you
won't
limit
introduction
of
the
crimes
of
dishonesty.
now,
the
beginning
of
rule
609
just
states,
as
a
general
purpose,
that
for
the
purpose
of
attacking
credibility
of
witnesses,
evidence
of
prior
conviction
shall
be
admitted.
that
is
the
general
rule...
it
shall
be
admitted.
and
part
(1),
apparently
makes
an
exception
for
the
criminal
defendant
in
a
criminal
case;
and
(2)
makes
an
exception
to
that
exception
in
criminal
cases.
i
mean
that
seems
to
be
the
import
of
the
rule,
doesn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
guess
there
is
a
move
afoot
now
to
amend
the
rule,
to
apply
a
sort
of
403
balancing,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
aba
has
made
a
recommendation
on
other
groups,
is
that
right?
