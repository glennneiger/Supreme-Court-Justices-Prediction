well,
as
the
rule
went
over
to
congress
from
us,
you
would
have
lost.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
only
thing
that
happened
to
it
was
this
provision
for
balancing
if
a...
with
respect
to
if
it
would
prejudice
the
defendant.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
was
talked
a
lot
about.
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn't
most
of
the
real
worry
about
criminal
defendants?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
well,
certainly
you
would
have...
you
would
have
the
same
worry
apply
to
witnesses
generally.
justice
byron
r.
white
civil,
criminal,
anything.
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
if
403
would
cut
across
everything
like
that,
they
wouldn't
have
needed
to
worry
about
putting
some
reservation
in
this
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
tell
me
if
403
is
applicable,
the
way
they
amended
the
rule
was
absolutely
useless.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
balancing
test
was
going
to
be
applied,
in
any
event,
under
403,
they
certainly
didn't
need
to
provide
especially
for
it
in
609.
justice
byron
r.
white
especially
you
would
have
thought
that
if
403
is
going
to
apply...
if
it
applied
anywhere,
it
would
apply
to
the
criminal
defendant.
