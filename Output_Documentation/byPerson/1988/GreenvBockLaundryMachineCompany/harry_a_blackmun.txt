mr.
caldwell,
did
you
try
this
case
below?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
is
a
products
liability
case,
isn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
where
the
man's
arm
was
literally
torn
off
from
his
shoulder?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
just
as
a
matter
of
tactics,
why
were
these
prior
felonies
introduced?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
was
there
a
feeling
that
the
accident
didn't
happen
at
all?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
did
you
want
to
make
a
liar
out
of
him?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
what
respect?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
then
why
did
you
need
the
felony
convictions?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
carried
to
an
extreme,
your
theory
would
almost
relegate
a
felony
injured...
a
felon
who
is
injured...
almost
prevent
him
from
recovering,
ever.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
we
are
not
talking
about
a
criminal
defendant.
we
are
talking
about
a
civil
plaintiff,
here.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
there
is
a
bit
of
a
distinction
between
the
two.
