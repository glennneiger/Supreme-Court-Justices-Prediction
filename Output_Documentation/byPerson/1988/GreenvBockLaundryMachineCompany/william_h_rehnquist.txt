we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
87-1716,
paul
green
v.
the
bock
laundry.
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
these
rules
are
applicable
in
both
criminal
and
civil
proceedings,
aren't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
when
they
say
the
defendant
in
these
rules,
they
could
mean
the
criminal
defendant?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
can't
it?
why
can't
you
say
that
the
rule
is
talking
about
prejudicial
effect
to
the
criminal
defendant?
there
is
no
criminal
defendant
in
a
civil
case
and
therefore,
the
outweighing
doesn't
apply.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
can
you
make
that
general
a
statement?
i
mean
up
until
the
time
of
the
codification
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence,
it
depended
on
the
laws
of
the
various
states,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
did
he
mean
by
the
collateral
criminal
matter?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
does
it
make
sense
in
that
way?
what
standard
would
you
work
under?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
403
is
more
general
than
609,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
conference
report
says
in
one
sentence,
doesn't
it,
that
the
committee
decided
that
they
were
not
interested
in
considering
the
prejudice
to
a
witness.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
they
don't
say
in
a
criminal
matter.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
did
not
say
the
criminal
defendant
either.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
