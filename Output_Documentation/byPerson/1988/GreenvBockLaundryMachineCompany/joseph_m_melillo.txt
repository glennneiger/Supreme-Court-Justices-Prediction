mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
congress
intended
federal
rule
of
evidence
609-a-1
could
be
the
standard
for
deciding
whether
to
admit
evidence
of
a
party's
felonies
for
purposes
of
impeachment
in
a
civil
case.
petitioner
takes
the
position
that
congress
intended
no
such
thing.
such
a
view
of
the
law
of
that
particular
rule
leads
to
results
which
are
not
only
unfair,
but
bizarre.
rather,
petitioner
takes
the
view,
as
have
most
of
the
courts
which
have
decided
this
issue
that
in
civil
cases,
the
trial
judge
must
retain
significant
discretion
over
whether
to
admit
such
evidence.
by
way
of
background,
this
case
arose
as
a
civil
product
liability
case.
allegedly,
a
laundry
water
extractor
manufactured
by
bock
machine
company
was
defective
and
that
defect
resulted
in
the
plaintiff,
the
19-year
old
plaintiff's
arm
being
torn
off.
in
the
third
circuit,
in
the
case
of
diggs
v.
lyons,
there
was
a
decision...
two
to
one...
that
in
civil
cases,
rule
609(a)(1)
mandates
without
any
part
of
discretion,
on
the
part
of
the
trial
judge,
that
evidence
of
impeachment
felonies
must
be
admitted
in
a
civil
case.
for
that
reason,
the
trial
judge
was
bound
in
this
case
to
admit
such
evidence.
since
the
diggs
decision,
one
other
circuit
court
has
joined
that
reasoning
in
the
case
of
greer
v....
campbell
v.
greer
in
the
seventh
circuit.
and
i
would
point
out
that
since
joining
that
decision,
the
seventh
circuit
now
has
a
division
within
it...
excuse
me,
the
eighth
circuit
now
has
a
division
within
itself.
so
that
now,
there
is
not
only
a
division
between
the
circuits,
it
is
the
one...
the
first,
fifth,
sixth
and
eighth
takes
the
view
that
there
is
discretion,
but
now,
the
third
and
seventh
oppose
that.
and
within
the
seventh
there
is
itself,
a
division
between
panels.
it
is
petitioner's
position
that
diggs
and
campbell
are
wrong
for
the
following
reasons.
the
literal
language
of
the
rule
could
not
sensibly
be
applied
to
civil
cases,
if
it
intended
such
a
result.
second,
the
legislative
record
does
not
show
that
congress
intended
that
result.
third,
other
principles
of
statutory
construction,
well
settled
in
our
law,
would
be
violated
if
that
result
occurred.
turning
first
to
the
literal
language
of
the
rule...
the
rule
says
that
felonies
will
be
admitted
unless...
unless
the
probative
value
of
such
evidence
is
outweighed
by
its
prejudicial
effect
to
the
defendant.
it
does
not
say
criminal
defendant;
it
does
not
say
civil
defendant.
if
you
were
to
apply
that
rule
literally
to
civil
cases,
you
would
have
to
apply
a
weighing
or
balancing
procedure
to
the
civil
defendant
or
the
civil
plaintiff
or
other
witnesses
would
not
have
the
advantage
of
that
particular
rule.
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
generally
so.
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
and
i
believe
that
is
exactly
what
they
did
mean,
the
criminal
defendant.
but
the
point
is
that
the
rule
is
so
ambiguous
on
its
face,
that
it
lends
credence
to
the
view
which
i
intend
to
get
into,
that
congress
never
considered
the
effect
the
rule
should
have
with
respect
to
civil
parties.
congress
was
consumed
solely
with
the
plight
of
the
criminal
defendant
when
it
debated
and
enacted
this
rule.
the
rule
cannot
be
sensibly
applied
in
civil
cases.
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
you
can
do
that,
but
i
believe
that
if
you
are
going
to
change
the
literal
meaning
of
the
rule,
you
are
then
bound
to
go
into
the
legislative
history
and
other
rules
of
statutory
construction
to
see
what
congress
might
really
have
intended.
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
no,
i
don't
believe
it
was
that
strict.
old,
old
common
law,
a
felon
was
incompetent
to
testify.
the
rule
was
changed
to
simply
permit
the
use
of
his
felony
conviction
against
him
for
impeachment
purposes,
but
over
the
course
of
decades,
that
rule
was
modified
to
the
extent
that
the
trial
court
would
retain
discretion
to
judge
whether
the
probative
value
of
that
particular
was
outweighed
by
its
prejudicial
effect.
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
it
was
one
of
the
sources
that
the
judges
looked
to.
they
also
looked
at
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
43,
which
was
said
to
have
a
bias
in
favor
of
admissibility,
federal
equity
cases
and
the
rule
of
the
states.
so
that
a
federal
common
law
developed
which
took
its
basis
from
many
sources,
and
which
while
generally,
admitting
these
felonies,
did
retain,
or
did
provide
that
the
trial
court
was
some
measure
of
discretion.
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
i
think
that
is
the
most
sensible
view.
i
would
prefer,
as
a
plaintiff's
attorney
for
the
balancing
test
applicable
to
the
criminal
defendant
to
apply,
but
i
must
tell
you
very
frankly
that
you
will
find
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
which
would
indicate
that
congress
intended
that
result.
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
honesty
or
dishonesty?
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
i
would
say
no.
the
main
reason
being
it
is
much
more
arguable
that
congress
did
intend
to
specifically
cover
that
field
when
it
enacted
<six
oh
nine>[=
609],
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
than
it
is
in
this
particular
case.
that
the
legislative
history
is
simply
devoid
of
any
consideration
of
how
to
treat
the
civil
litigants.
there
is
another...
there
is
another
way
of
looking
at
the
rule,
which
i
will
mention
now.
there
is
a
way
to
conform
the
literal
language
of
the
rule
so
that
it
can
be
applied
sensibly.
this
was
suggested
by
a
district
court
judge
in
pennsylvania
after
the
diggs
decision
came
down.
that
particular
judge
said
the
defendant
should
mean
the
defendant
in
the
collateral
criminal
matter.
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
well,
where
the
conviction
was
obtained.
that
is,
you
were
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case,
in
which
a
conviction
was
obtained
and
which
is
now
being
sought
to
be
used
against
you.
if
you
read
to
the
defendant
in
that
way,
the
rule
makes
sense.
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
a
balancing
test
could
then
be
applied
to
any
witness
or
party
in
either
civil
or
criminal
litigation,
because
everybody
against
whom
a
conviction
is
sought
to
be
offered
was
a
defendant
in
a
collateral
criminal
matter.
that
makes
sense
out
of
the
rule.
the
problem
is
the
legislative
history
very
obviously
doesn't
support
that
particular
view
either.
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
and
a
lot
of
courts
who
have
considered
this
issue
have
done
just
that.
they
assume
that
congress
must
have
meant
witness
rather
than
defendant
and
that
slipping
in
defendant
was
some
kind
of
oversight.
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
exactly
right,
also.
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
i
think
that
in
addition
to
prejudice
to
witnesses,
you
have
to
do
something
to
avoid
undue
harrassment
of
witnesses
where--
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
--i
would
look
at
rule
102
for
that,
or
perhaps
611,
which
gives
the
courts,
in
general,
some
authority
to
avoid
harrassment
of
witnesses,
and
to
secure
justice
and
avoid
unfairness.
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
you
could
also
look
to
403,
which
states
generally,
where
the
probative
effect
of
evidence
is
substantially
outweighed
by
its
prejudicial
value,
then
the
court
may
exclude
it.
so
you
can
look
there
as
well.
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
yes,
it
is.
and
it
is
intended
to
apply
where
there
are
not
more
specific
rules.
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make
is
that
i
do
not
believe
that
609(a)(1)
is
specific
as
to
civil
cases,
only
as
to
criminal
matters.
therefore,
403
can
be
applied.
there
is
a
whole
line
of
cases
which
have,
in
fact,
taken
this
approach,
and
i
believe
they
state
the
best
reasoning
in
this
area.
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
it
could
be
and
if
congress,
when
considering
the...
this
particular
rule,
anywhere
indicated
that
is
what
they
intended,
i
would
have
to
say
that
is
correct.
but
congress
simply
does
not
do
so.
and
to
apply
such
an
interpretation
to
the
rule
would
violate
other
statutory
construction
axioms,
including
that
you
should
not
change
the
prior
practice...
that
is
the
common
law,
well
established...
unless
you
say
so
explicitly
in
a
statute.
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
i
think
that
civil
cases
are
very
different
from
criminal
cases
and
for
a
rule
to
apply
sensibly,
you
have
to
consider
those
differences.
first
of
all,
a
criminal
defendant
can
always
avoid
impeachment
simply
by
refusing
to
take
the
stand.
and
this
goes
not
only
as
to
his
felonies,
but
as
to
his
prior
crimes
of
dishonesty
and
false
statement.
a
civil
party
never
has
that
luxury.
a
civil
party
can
be
forced
to
testify
as
on
cross-examination
and
impeached.
a
civil
party's
deposition
can
be
taken
pre-trial;
he
can
be
impeached
there
and
that
can
be
read
into
the
record,
regardless
of
whether
he
takes
the
stand.
he
can
be
forced
to
answer
written
questions
as
well
and
the
same
thing
can
be
done.
a
civil
party
has
absolutely
no
protection
from
the
effect
of
impeaching
felonies,
while
the
criminal
defendant
does.
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
the
integrity
of
the
fact
finding
process,
although
i
think
that
congress--
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
--yes,
which
is
why
congress
did
enact
a
very
strict
balancing
test
with
regard
to
the
criminal
defendant.
it
is
a
stricter
test
than
you
find
in
403.
i
don't
think
that
it
follows
from
that
that--
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
--that
is
right.
it
is
simply
excluded
if
the
probative
value
is
outweighed
by
the
prejudicial
effect,
not
substantially
outweighed,
but
just
outweighed.
and
i
also
believe
that
it
is
the
prosecution's
burden
to
show
that
it
is
not.
so,
it
is
a
very
strict
test
that
congress
devised
on
behalf
of
the
criminal
defendant.
recognizing,
of
course,
that
the
effect
of
a
criminal
conviction
is
very
severe,
and
that
jurors
might
tend
to
use
evidence
of
prior
criminal
behavior
to
assume
that
somebody
who
did
something
bad
once
would
do
it
again...
that
is
the
main
danger
of
it.
i
don't
think
it
follows
from
that,
that
is,
that
congress
intended
to
protect
the
criminal
defendant,
that
they
intended
to
ignore
or
impose
a
rule
harsher
than
the
common
law
upon
the
civil
plaintiff
or
civil
witnesses.
i
think
what
you
mainly
have
is
legislative
oversight.
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
in
a
criminal
matter.
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
i
thought
that
was
the
fair
reading
of
it.
they
felt
that
the
rights
of
the
criminal
defendant
were
so
great
that--
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
--i
think
it
is
clear
reading
the
conference
committee
report
that
they
are
talking
about
conviction
and
defendant
and
they're
talking...
and
the
plain
meaning
is
really
just
criminal
defendant.
i
don't
really
know
that
it
can
be
read
any
other
way.
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
yes,
when
the
final
version
of
the
rule
came
from
the
judicial
conference
and
the
supreme
court,
its
language
was
a
felony
shall
be
admitted
and--
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
--i
think
a
great
deal
more
happened
to
it
than
that.
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
yes,
it
was.
it
was.
the
basic
positions
of
the
house
and
senate
at
the
time--
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
--i
think
it
was
the
only
worry.
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
you
would,
although
i
think
you
might
make--
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
--i
think
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
way
that
you
might
want
to
treat
criminal
witnesses
and
the
way
that
you
might
want
to
treat
witnesses
in
a
civil
case,
because
you
are
so
concerned
in
the
criminal
arena
about...
about
the
defendant,
you
might
want
to
give
the
defendant
the
right
to
impeach
those
witnesses,
where
you
might
not
want
to
do
the
same
in
a
civil
case.
civil
cases
turn
largely,
many
of
them,
on
technical
issues,
especially
the
kinds
that
you
find
in
the
federal
courts.
in
diversity
cases,
you
very
often,
for
example,
have
product
liability
cases,
wherein
the
record
is
consumed
by
expert
testimony
concerning
the
way
a
machine
is
designed,
the
way
it
operates
and
its
safety
features.
that
was
the
case
here.
credibility
issues
do
exist
in
these
cases,
but
they
do
not
exist
to
the
same
extent
and
with
the
same
importance
as
they
do
in
the
criminal
matters.
therefore,
i
think
that
a
rule
much
harsher
than
in
the
criminal
case
could
not
sensibly
have
been
intended
by
congress
for
civil
cases.
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
well,
since
subpart
(2)
appears
to
be
a
very
specific
rule
which
is
sensible
on
its
face,
i
think
it
would
have
to
be
said
that
403
cannot
apply
to
it.
that
issue
is
not
currently
before
the
court,
and
in
order
to
really
answer
that
question,
i
would
have
to
analyze
the
entire
legislative
history
very
carefully
to
see
what
congress
considered,
when
it
enacted
that
rule
with
regard
to
civil
parties.
but
i
think,
certainly
the
argument
becomes
much
greater
when
you
are
dealing
with
(a)(2)
than
(a)(1).
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
my
theory
is
that
(1)
applies
solely
in
the
criminal
arena,
because
the
language
of
the
rule,
on
its
face,
talks
about
criminal
cases,
because
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
congress
was
only
concerned
with
criminal
cases;
(a)(2)
on
the
other
hand,
both
by
its
language,
and
very
possibly
by
its
legislative
history,
is
specific
as
to
both.
therefore,
i
would
not
apply
rule
403
to
(a)(2).
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
i
am
sorry,
i
am
not
exactly
sure
what
you
mean.
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
correct.
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
yes,
but
i
think
it
is
clear
what
congress
intended
if
you
read
the
conference
committee
report
and
the
other
legislation,
is
that
to
properly
protect
the
criminal
defendant,
some
of
the
evidence
should
be
admissible
against
other
witnesses
in
criminal
proceedings,
including
the
prosecution's
witnesses.
that
while
it
may
be
unfair
to
subject
them
to
that,
the
interests
of
the
defendant
are
so
great
in
avoiding
conviction,
if
he
is
not
guilty,
that
that
should
be
done.
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
the
states
vary
largely
in
their
approach.
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
pennsylvania,
for
example,
where
this
case
arose,
at
the
time
of
this
trial,
never
permitted
the
admission
of
felonies
against
a
witness
in
a
criminal
or
a
civil
case.
and
permitted
the
introduction
of
what
we
call
crimen
falsi
evidence,
only
upon
a
balancing
test.
pennsylvania
recently
changed
that
rule
to
automatically
permit
the
introduction
of
crimen
falsi
evidence,
but
still
you
cannot
introduce
evidence
of
felonies
in
a
pennsylvania
civil
or
criminal
action.
that
is
my
understanding
of
it.
which
means
that
if
this
case
had
been
brought
in
a
pennsylvania
state
court,
mr.
green's
felonies
would
not
have
come
in.
and
the
harm
of
that,
when
you
construe
rule
609
(a)
to
be
so
harsh
in
civil
cases,
is
that
you
will
inevitably
have
forum
shopping.
if
i
had
initiated
this
case
in
state
court,
it
would
have
been
removed
to
federal
court;
i
could
not
have
prevented
it,
if
that
is
what
the
defendants
wanted
to
do
just
to
get
the
advantage.
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
yes.
inevitably
there
are
many,
you
know,
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
probably
conflict
in
many
respects
to
certain
state
rules
and
there
is
always
some
forum
shopping.
you
cannot
avoid
that
altogether.
i
would
just
like
to
avoid
the
worst
instances
of
it,
if
possible.
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
well,
pennsylvania
is
a
good
example
where
it
would
occur.
one
of
the
unspoken
questions
that
the
diggs
court
did
not
answer
and
i
think
has
to
be
addressed,
is
that
when
a
rule
is
ambiguous
on
its
face,
so
that
it
is
capable
of
yielding
bizarre
results
if
interpreted
literally,
just
what
do
you
need
to
expect
from
the
congressional
record
in
order
to
say
that
it
does
or
does
not
mean
what
it
says
literally?
petitioner
takes
the
position
that
you
cannot
construe
congressional
intent
under
those
circumstances,
simply
from
silence,
congressional
silence,
that
there
must
be
some
affirmative
evidence
in
the
congressional
record
indicating
that
congress
actually
intended
that
kind
of
result.
that
does
not
exist
in
this
case.
the
diggs
court
did
cite
four...
what
is
called
snippets...
comments
by
individual
legislators,
but
they
don't
really
amount
to
much
when
weighed
against
the
whole
legislative
history,
nor
taken
in
context,
do
they
really
indicate
that
those
congressmen
wanted
this
particular
result.
to
conclude,
i
really...
i
really
believe
that
congress
did
not
intend
this
interpretation.
the
plain
language
of
the
rule
does
not
require
that
interpretation
and
standard
principles
of
statutory
construction
applied
to
this
rule
require
that
it
not
be
deemed
specific,
as
to
civil
parties
and
witnesses
and
that,
therefore,
rule
403
may
apply.
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
that
is
basically
why
the
diggs
court
took
their
silence
to
mean
acquiesence.
that
is,
congress
knew
that
they
were
going
to
apply
to
both
and
therefore,
you
should
presume
that
it
applies
to
both.
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
but
if
you
solve
it
in
that
manner,
then
what
you
wind
up
doing
is
putting
the
civil
litigant
and
witness
in
a
position
much
worse
than
they
were
at
under
the
prior
practice,
while
essentially
stacking
the
deck
in
favor
of
the
criminal
defendant,
with
a
congress
which,
in
its
legislative
history,
was
trying
to
be
innovative
in
this
area.
while
you
could
do
that,
it
clashes
against
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
congressional
record,
and
it
clashes
against
other
principles
of
statutory
construction,
which
are
very
meaningful.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
i
will
be
brief.
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
yes,
i
do.
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
yes.
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
for
two
reasons.
one
is
that
congress
was
so
concerned
about
the
rights
of
the
defendant
and
that
the
defendant
not
be
convicted,
except
if
he
is
truly
guilty.
therefore,
congress
would
permit
the
criminal
defendant
to
have
the
right
to
impeach
the
prosecution's
witness
while
potentially,
himself,
being
immune
from
impeachment.
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
it
also
must
be
understood,
though,
that
there
are
many
avenues
for
impeaching
civil
parties
that
are
not
available
in
criminal
cases,
and
therefore
it
is
not
necessary
to
have,
even
ask
it
to
rule
in
civil
cases
with
regard
to
impeachment.
there
are
many
ways
of
getting
at
the
truth
in
civil
cases,
that
potentially
are
not
available
in
criminal
cases.
this
is
the
rationale
as
to
fairness...
congress
did
not
really
go
to
the
trouble
of
considering
all
of
this,
but
i
think
it's,
it's
the
basis
for
any
fair
and
just
statutory
construction.
i
just
want,
to
make
a
few
brief
points.
first,
about
the
prior
practice.
i
quoted
this
in
my
brief,
but
i
guess
it
is
worth
repeating
here.
judge
fremley
of
the
second
circuit
testified
before
the
subcommittee
of
the
house,
and
he
was
asked
about
the
traditional
practice
and
he
said
they
were
generally
admissible,
but
of
course,
there
was
the
overriding
rule
that
the
judge
can
always
exclude
testimony
where
probative
value,
he
thinks,
is
outweighed
by
its
prejudicial
effect.
he
was,
in
effect,
giving
the
common
law
to
the
advisory
committee,
and
that
is
what
he
said.
that
particular
statement
comports
very
well
with
what
rule
403
says.
with
respect
to
those
four
so-called
snippets
of
legislative
history,
let
me
give
you
an
idea
of
what
they
mean
taken
in
context.
for
example,
representative
wiggins...
excuse
me...
lott
indicated
that
it
applies
in
all
senses.
but
he
also
said,
almost
in
the
same
statement,
but
of
course,
there
is
always
rule
401.
what
he
meant
was
403.
he
believed
that
rule
403
would
cut
across
it.
representative
hogan...
i
believe,
it
is
cited
as
hungate
in
respondent's,
brief...
opposed
the
version
which
the
house
handed
down.
the
house
handed
down
a
version
which
would
only
admit
evidence
of
dishonesty
or
false
statement
and
so
opposing
it,
he
made
some
comments.
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
i
think...
i
think
you
are
correct.
i
think
though
what,
it
shows
is
that
you
can't
take
these
cut
of
context
statements
for
indicating
or
meaning
more
than
they
really
do.
i
won't
go
through
each
of
them,
but
if
you
examine
them
in
context,
you
come
to
a
similar
result.
some
of
then
were
by
the
opponents
of
the
legislation--
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
--the
way
that
they
would...
i
am
not
sure
i
follow
exactly.
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
yes,
with
respect
to
the
criminal
defendant.
the
criminal
defendant,
i
think,
it
is
a
stricter
test.
mr.
joseph
m.
melillo
but
they,
they
actually
devised
is
a
stricter
balancing
test
than
they
use
in
403...
they
gave
him
something
over
and
beyond
what
403
contains.
the
difference
being
substantial
prejudice
as
opposed
to
mere
prejudice,
which
i
think
is
a
very
big
difference.
let
me
just
address
this
harmless
error
issue
a
second.
i
am
not
going
to
reiterate
the
brief,
but
i
did
point
out
that
there
was
a
credibility
issue
with
respect
to
the
warnings
theory,
as
well,
not
just
assumption
of
the
risk.
plus,
i
think
that
the
court
has
to
be
aware
that
when
evidence
is
so
prejudicial
and
poisonous,
a
jury
can
use
it
for
purposes
of
simply
finding
against
a
party
without,
you
know,
really
considering
what
its
effect
is
with
respect
to
any
particular
piece
of
evidence.
thank
you.
