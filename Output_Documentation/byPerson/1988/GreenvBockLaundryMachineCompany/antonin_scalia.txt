justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
the
exception
is
not
specific,
except
as
to
criminal
matters.
but
there
are
so
many
different
ways
of
slicing
the
question
here.
the
provision,
itself,
which
says
it
will
be
considered,
as
opposed
to
the
exception,
could
be
regarded
as
quite
specific,
for
both
criminal
and
civil
matters.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
would
you
conceivably
want
this
evidence
to
come
in,
in
a
criminal
case,
and
not
in
a
civil
case?
i
mean
i
can
understand
why
you
might
want
the
exception
to
apply
only
in
a
criminal
case
and
not
in
a
civil
case,
but
why
would
you
want
the
whole
rule
of
admitting
this
evidence
to
apply
only...
only
in
criminal
cases?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
your
position
that
only
subpart
(1)
of
609(a)
applies
only
to
criminal
cases,
or
is
it
subpart
(2)
as
well?
is,
is
the
court
free
to
apply
403
and
to
exclude
evidence
that
a
witness,
or
a
party
in
a
civil
case,
had
been
convicted
of
a
crime
involving
false
statement?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
point
is
that
you
can
use
the
reference
to
the
defendant
which
makes
so
little
sense
as
applied
to
a
civil
defendant,
to
just
eliminate
the
sole
portion
of
609
which
says,
and
the
court
determines
that
the
probative
value
outweighs
its
prejudice
to
the
defendant,
you
could
use
to
eliminate
that
much.
or
you
could
use
it
to
eliminate
all
of
(1),
or
i
suppose
you
could
use
it
to
eliminate
both
(1)
and
(2)
and
i
was
just
trying
to
get
what
your
theory
is.
you
say
at
least
one
and
you
are
noncommittal
as
to
the
rest.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
shouldn't
we
adopt
the
standard
rule
of
statutory
construction
that
the
rules
say
and
congress
clearly
intended
that
the
rules,
as
a
whole,
should
apply
both
in
civil
and
criminal
cases?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
right,
except...
and...
and
any
exception
from
that
rule,
caused
by
the
irrationality
of
the
languages,
should
be
narrowed
as
much
as
necessary...
should
be
narrowed
to
the
degree
essential
to
eliminate
the
absurdity.
and
that
would
be
eliminated
simply
by
saying,
you
don't
get
an
exception
when
it
outweighs
its
prejudice
to
a
civil
defendant.
that
portion
of
it
is
deleted.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
burden
is
on
you
to
show
why
a
section
in
a...
in
a
provision
of
law
that
is
meant
to
apply
to
both
civil
and
criminal
should
not
apply
to
both,
and,
and,
and
that
the
exception
that
we
read
into
the
text
of
the
statute
should
be
as
now
as
is
necessary
to
solve
the
problem.
and
you
are
giving
us
an
interpretation
that
really
goes
much
further
than
is
necessary
to
solve
the
absurdity
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
melillo,
before
your
brief,
something
has
occurred
to
me
while
i
have
been
listening
to
this.
you
do
acknowledge
that
in
criminal
cases,
the
witnesses
for
the
prosecution
are
subject
to
this
rule?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
congress
must
have
thought
that
at
least
in
criminal
cases,
it
does
serve
the
truth
finding
function
to
impeach
any
witness
who
has
a
felony?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
would
congress
think
that
is
an
appropriate
rule
in
criminal
cases,
except
of
course,
where
it
harms
the
defendant;
but
not
think
that
it
is
an
appropriate
rule
in
civil
cases?
