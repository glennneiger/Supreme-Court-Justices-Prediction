justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
is
your
position
in
reference
to
witnesses?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
to
begin
with,
where
do
i
look...
rule
403?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why
not
403?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
was...
was
this
designed
to
protect
the
integrity
and
reputation
and
privacy
of
the
witness
or
the
integrity
of
the
fact-finding
process?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
as
justice
scalla's
question
suggests,
i
should
think
that
in
the
criminal
process
the
danger
of
prejudice
is,
is
much
greater.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in,
in,
in
the
first
class
of
criminal
offenses?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
am
not
sure
of
the
relevance
of
it.
are
the
states
in
some
disarray
on
this
or
is
a
uniform
consensus
emerged
as
to
whether
or
not
such
impeachments
are
desirable
in
a
criminal...
civil
trial?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
if
the
states
are
in
disarray
then
a
state,
other
than
pennsylvania
has
a
different
rule,
and
what
we
decide
would
be
in
conformity
with
that.
so,
whatever
we
do,
there
is
going
to
be
some
forum
shopping.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
the
worst
instances
are
in
pennsylvania,
i
take
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose...
suppose
in
this
case,
that
the
chief
designer
for
the
company
was
named
as
a
co-defendant,
and
he
testified
about
the
design
of
the
machine.
and
the
plaintiff
seeks
to
impeach
him,
what
ruling...
he
has
been
convicted,
say,
of
theft?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and,
and
how
do
you
justify
that
interpretation
of
the
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
those...
do
those
lead
to
a
statutory
argument
at
the
end?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
so
the
impeachment
testimony
would
be
admissible
to
impeach
the
defendant?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm...
i'm...
i'm
assuming
that
he
is
a
defendant,
and
the
defendant
is
not
entitled
to
the
balancing
test?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
in
my
hypothetical,
the
impeachment
is
admitted
and
there
is
no
balancing
test?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
is
because
the
statute
is
not
read
strictly?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
if
we
are
not
going
to
read
the
statute
strictly,
why
don't
we
give
the
balancing
test
to
the
plaintiff?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words,
the
statute
is
ambiguous,
and
we
are
to
go
to
the
legislative
history?
