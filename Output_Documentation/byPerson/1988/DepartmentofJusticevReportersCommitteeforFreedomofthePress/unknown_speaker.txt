unknown
speaker
mr.
englert,
do
you
think
there's
any
basis
for
drawing
a
distinction
between
past
criminal
convictions
for
which
the
common
law
generally
supports
the
notion
that
is
a
matter
of
public
record
and
public
interest
and
arrests
or
indictments
or
other
criminal
investigation
information
that
hasn't
resulted
in
a
conviction?
unknown
speaker
do
the
federal
courts
have
to
develop
some
federal
common
law
on...
on
how
you...
you
measure
the
public
interest
and
the
privacy
concerns?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
the
whole...
the
whole
underpinning
of
the
first
amendment
is
that
it's
really
impossible,
or
at
least
undesirable,
for
the
government
to
determine
what
information
is
more
desirable
than
other
information.
and
yet,
you
ask
us
to
make
a
public
interest
determination
as
to
whether
a
particular
item
of
information
is
more
useful
to
the
citizenry
than
another
one.
i'm
not...
i'm
not
inclined
to
want
to
make
that
determination.
unknown
speaker
or...
or
read
it
the
way
it
has
been
read
by
the
court
below.
unknown
speaker
how
would
you
evaluate
the
public
interest?
whether...
whether
it
would
be
likely
to
appear
in
a
newspaper
the
next
day,
or
whether
it's
useful
to
scholars
or
what?
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--what...
what
sort
of
information
about
him?
you
will
presumably
judge
whether
sexual
peccadillos
would
be
the
kind
of
information
the
public
should
know
in
an
election
or...
or
other
kind
of
information
would
be
more
important.
right?
you...
you
would
judge.
the
justice
department
would
make
that
judgment
initially
and
ultimately
the
courts
would
make
that
judgment,
what
the
public
ought
to
know
about
this
individual.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
like
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
englert,
do
you
think
the
public
figure
doctrine
under
libel
law
has
any
useful
analogies
for
the
court?
unknown
speaker
but
it's
a
task...
there
is
a
more
express
mandate
for,
and
certainly
under
section
7(c)
of
the
act,
isn't
there?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
indication
that
they
thought
the
public
figure
concept
should
be
taken
into
consideration?
unknown
speaker
in
construing
the
section
we're
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
should
the
identity
of
the
requestor
be
relevant?
unknown
speaker
can
the
courts
look
at
the
purpose
for
which
the
information
is
sought?
unknown
speaker
mr.
englert,
the
question
isn't
really
or
primarily...
it
isn't
exclusively
or
even
primarily...
whether
the
courts
can
look
into
this
or
that,
but
whether
the
justice
department
can.
the
primary
addressee
of
the
rule
that
you
want
us
to
adopt
is
the
justice
department.
you
will
be
making
these
decisions.
the
justice
department
will
be
making
these
decisions
in
evaluating
every
single
freedom
of
information
request
for
this
kind
of
information.
the
courts
will
come
in
now
and
then
only
when
your
decision
is
challenged.
but
you
ask
us
to
believe
that
what
congress
wanted
is
for
the
justice
department
to
determine
case
by
case
where
the
public
interest
lies
in...
in
getting...
in
getting
information.
unknown
speaker
and
now
and
then
you
may
be
wrong,
and
a
court
will
correct
you.
but
you
are
sort
of
to
determine...
unlike
the
libel
cases
which
come
into
court,
here
it's
the
executive
that's
going
to
decide
what
the
public
ought
to
know.
unknown
speaker
take
abc.
a
man
named
abc
was
arrested
for
disorderly
conduct
in
seattle,
washington.
and
mno
was
arrested
for
disorderly
conduct
in
miami.
and
you
decide
to
give
one
and
not
the
other.
how
could
you
do
that?
unknown
speaker
xxx.
how
could
you
grant
one
and
deny
the
other
one?
unknown
speaker
so,
you're
going
to
deny
both
of
them
or
grant
both
of
them?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
were
going
to
make
a
choice
between
the
two.
unknown
speaker
what
situation?
unknown
speaker
what
situation?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
what's
important
to
the
person
or
what's
important
to
the
department?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
public
interest
is
what?
department
of
justice.
that's
the
public
interest.
unknown
speaker
so,
you're
saying
the
public
interest...
we
will
deny
a
and
grant
b.
unknown
speaker
in
the
public
interest.
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
you
have
to
explain
it
to
somebody?
unknown
speaker
first
yourself.
unknown
speaker
and
the
courts
would
have
to
decide
as
to
whether
the
well-publicized
man's
good
name
is
more
important
than
the
little,
ordinary
man
is.
unknown
speaker
the
court
will
have
to
do
it.
unknown
speaker
hum?
unknown
speaker
then
we
will
have...
we'll
have
to
do
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
englert,
has
the
department
developed
any
standards
or
rules
that
are
written
out
as
to
what
factors
might
control,
i
mean,
excluding
arrests
or
setting
statutes
of
limitations
and
that
sort
of
thing?
or
is
it
totally
ad
hoc?
unknown
speaker
are
they
subject
to
disclosure
pursuant
to
the
foia?
unknown
speaker
they're
not
in
the
record,
though,
are
they?
we
don't
know
what
they
are.
unknown
speaker
mr.
englert,
is...
is
there
any
way
under
the
language
of
the
statute
to
give
you
a
half
of
a
loaf?
the
statute
in
7(c)
says
could
reasonably
expect
to
constitute
an
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy.
now,
the
privacy
act
considers
records
that...
records
that
are
kept
by
name.
those...
those
are
the
only
records
to
which
the
privacy
act
applies.
unknown
speaker
yes.
and
i
gather
that
what
that...
what
that
represents
is
a
sense
of
the
congress
that
if
the
thing
isn't
kept
by
name,
it's
not...
it's
not
going
to
hurt
you
anyway.
nobody
can
find
it.
it
won't
be
used
for
an
invasion
of
your
privacy
or
things
of
that
sort.
what
about
a...
what
about
a
rule
that...
that
would
say
if
the...
if
the
information
is...
is
on
record
out
there
before
it's
given
to
the
fbi
or
whoever,
but
is
not
retained
where
it
is
kept
by
name,
it
is
still
considered
to
be
private;
but
where
it's
retained
by
name,
it
isn't?
do
you
have
any
idea
how
that
would
work
out?
unknown
speaker
you're...
you're
willing
to
speculate
on
the
public
interest,
but
not
to...
not
to
make
an
inquiry
as
to
whether
these
records
you
get
are
being
kept
by
name
or
not.
i
don't
know
why
the
one
is...
is
more
tedious
than
the
other.
unknown
speaker
congress
in
the
first
place
has
certainly
authorized,
or
at
least
tolerated,
the
fbi's
collection
of
all
this
information
in
a
way
where
it
is
accessible
where
it
wouldn't
have
been
if
the
fbi
hadn't
collected
it.
unknown
speaker
is
reasonable
expectation
is
that
no
one
would
find
the
criminal
conviction
that
is
spread
on
the
public
record
in
wherever
it
is
spread?
it's
so
hard
to
get
there
from
that
language.
that
is
his
reasonable
expectation,
that
nobody
would
find
it
because
although
it's
in
the
public
record
there,
it's
hard
to
find.
unknown
speaker
and
you
would
call
that
an
expectation
of
privacy.
it
may
be
a
reasonable
expectation,
but
you
would
describe
that
as
an
expectation
of
privacy?
unknown
speaker
that
a
public
record
won't
be
discovered.
unknown
speaker
xxx.
suppose
we
agree
with
you
that
the
court
of
appeals
used
the
wrong
balancing
test.
that's
essentially
what
you're
saying,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
would
we
remand?
i
guess
we
would,
wouldn't
we?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i'm
sure
you
would,
yes.
[laughter]
but
would
we
normally
do
that,
to
make
our
own
assessment
of
the
facts
under
a...
the
right
rule?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
englert.
mr.
baine?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
how
much
of
this
information
was
in...
incidentally,
was
the
pennsylvania
crime
commission
a
private
organization
or
a
public
organization?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
and
how
much
of
their...
how
much
of
this
information
was
in
their
public
report?
unknown
speaker
did
they
tell--
unknown
speaker
--did
they
tell...
did
they
tell
where...
where
and
when?
unknown
speaker
i
was
just
wondering
if
maybe
you
could
have
gone
directly
to
your
source.
unknown
speaker
mr.
baine?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
there's
a
difference
in
the
balance
between
unadjudicated
arrests
or
indictments
and
convictions?
unknown
speaker
yes,
it
can
put
people
in
a
very
false
light
if
you
base
information
on
arrests
i
think.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it
has
left
the
language
in
7(c)
rather
general,
whether
it
constitutes
an
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy,
and
conceivably
some
antiquated
arrest
records
might
well
be
an
unwarranted
invasion.
unknown
speaker
what
if
a
conviction
has
been
expunged
by
the
state?
unknown
speaker
is
the
expectation
of
the
subject
of
the
report
relevant
to
privacy
interests?
the
fact
that
you
may
or
may
not
expect
that
something
would
be
released...
is
that
relevant?
unknown
speaker
well,
your...
your
reasonable
expectation
of
what
the
press
might
find.
is
that
relevant?
unknown
speaker
well
now--
unknown
speaker
--an...
an
arrest
record
that's
in
some
remote
village
or
town
is
certainly
harder
for
the
press
to
get
than
if
it
just
goes
to
washington,
d.c.--
unknown
speaker
--doesn't
that
bear
on
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it--
unknown
speaker
--is
it
public
all
over
the
united
states
if
it
happens
some
small...
some
small--
unknown
speaker
--is
it
public
all
over
the
united
states
if
it
happens
some
remote
place
from
your
own
home?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
it's
just
irrelevant
to
the
individual's
expectation
that
there
is
a
central
index
in
washington,
d.c.
that
records
crimes
all
over
the
country.
that's
irrelevant
to
an
individual's
expectation
of
privacy.
that's
what
you
want
us
to
believe.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
on
that?
that
means
you
don't
have
to
balance
it
all
so
that
if
you
get
under
this
statute,
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
a
credit
reporting
agency
or
at
a
closing
of
a
loan
or
a
real
estate
deal
or
a
neighbor
is
wondering
about
somebody
coming
in
next
door...
all
of
those
people
would
just
automatically
get
full
information
about
the...
whatever
is
at
the
fbi,
they
have
a
right
to
get
it.
unknown
speaker
routinely.
unknown
speaker
which
is
your
position.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
your
position,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
think
that...
that
routinely
these
various
agencies
that
have
some
kind
of
inquiry
about
people
can
routinely
go
to
the
fbi
and
get
their
full
rap
sheet
all
over
the
country
for
their
entire
lives.
unknown
speaker
why
would
they
want
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--well,
it's
a
question
of
how
one
construes
the
word
"privacy"
in
this
exemption.
unknown
speaker
well,
your...
your
saying
then
that
exemption
7
was
primarily
directed
to
the
records
of
the
fbi
itself
that
weren't
made
public,
and
those
there
would
be
a
privacy
interest
in
if
the
fbi
has
put
together
something
that
isn't
of
record
anywhere.
but
when
it
comes
to
the
identification
section...
it's
just
a
collection
of
records
that
you
say
are
public
elsewhere...
then
it's
just
an
up
or
down
thing.
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
public,
just
what
do
you
mean?
do
you
mean
it's...
it's
of
record
somewhere
where
anyone
can
walk
in
off
the
street
and
look
at
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
that...
well,
go
ahead.
i
asked
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
baine,
i
think
even
mr.
englert
doesn't
suggest
that
criminal
convictions
are
going
to
be
sustained
as
private
information
very
often.
i
think
the
concern
probably
focuses
or...
on
arrests
and
indictments
and
other
information
short
of
a
conviction,
don't
you
suppose?
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
relying
on
the
court
of
appeals
rationale
then
which...
which
was
that
it
cannot
be
covered
by
this
privacy
exemption
if
it
is
a
matter
of
public
record
because
some
state
or
some
body
has
decided
that
this
is
a
matter
that
the
public
ought
to
know
about.
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
relying
on
that
theory.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
but...
but
you
say
that
some
things
may
be
public...
published
by
a
state
which
you...
you
would
considered
still
covered
by
the
public
interest
if...
by
a
privacy
expectation
if,
indeed,
it's
not
the
kind
of
a
matter
that...
that
you
think
the
public
ought
to
know
about.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
might
like
to
because
it's
a
lot
easier
to
figure
out
than
the...
than
the
line
you're
giving
us.
i--
unknown
speaker
--and,
of
course,
the
unfairness
doesn't
really
turn
on
whether
it's
a
violation
of
privacy
or
not.
unknown
speaker
do
you...
do
you
agree
entirely
with
the...
with
the
balancing
test
the
court
of
appeals
thought
was
applicable?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
disagree
with?
unknown
speaker
what
about
on
the
public
interest
side?
unknown
speaker
well,
the...
of
course,
the
government
challenges
the...
the
court's
balancing
test.
if
we
agree...
if
we
agree
with
the
government,
i
guess
we
also
agree
with
you.
unknown
speaker
xxx.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
what
would
we
do?
if
both
sides
agree
that
the
court
of
appeals
applied
the
wrong
test,
do
we
remand
or
what?
unknown
speaker
you
say
informed
about
the
affairs
of
government.
you're
trying
to
inform
yourselves
about
the
affairs
of
this
individual.
what
does
it
tell
you
about
the
fbi?
unknown
speaker
what
functions
of
the
government
does
it
tell
you
about?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
those
had
already
been
answered
in
the
pennsylvania
crime
commission
report.
unknown
speaker
mr.
baine,
i'm
not
sure
just
what...
what...
what
do
you
want
the
court
to
take
account
of
for
purposes
of
the
language
"an
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy.
"
what...
what
kind
of
things
would
you
let
the
court
take
into
account
to
determine
whether,
assuming
you've
come
across
something
that...
that
is
personal
privacy,
there
would
be
an
unwarranted
invasion
of
it?
wouldn't
the
court
have
to
get
into
some
of
these
kinds
of
areas?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
baine.
mr.
englert,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
i
don't
understand
why
you
think
the
jean
valjean
thing
is
so
obvious.
what...
what...
what
if
the
thing
that's
hidden
in
my
past
is
that
i
am
really
adolf
hitler
and
i
think
nobody
is...
is
going
to
know
that?
would
i
have
a
privacy
right
in...
in
somebody
not
finding
that
out
simply
because
it's
virtually
impossible
for
them
to
find
it--
unknown
speaker
--[inaudible]
question
of
public
record?
unknown
speaker
a
privacy--
unknown
speaker
--so--
unknown
speaker
--is
there
any
difference
in
your
estimation
between
an
expectation
of
privacy
and
an
expectation
of
non-discovery?
the
two
are
the
same.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
ten
o'clock.
