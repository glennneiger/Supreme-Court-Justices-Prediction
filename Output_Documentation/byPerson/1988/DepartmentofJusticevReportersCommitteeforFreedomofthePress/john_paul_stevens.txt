the
second
case,
united
states
department
of
justice
against
reporters
committee
for
freedom
of
the
press,
is
a
case
that
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
respondents,
a
cbs
news
correspondent
and
the
reporters
committee
for
freedom
of
the
press,
seek
disclosure
of
criminal
history
information
about
certain
private
individuals
contained
in
fbi
wrap
sheets.
exemption
7(c)
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
exempts
from
disclosure
records
or
information
compiled
for
law
enforcement
purposes
to
the
extent
that
the
production
of
such
materials
could
reasonably
be
expected
to
constitute
an
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
property.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
the
interest
of
a
private
citizen
in
non-disclosure
of
a
wrap
sheet
is
the
sort
of
personal
privacy
interest
that
congress
intended
exemption
7(c)
to
protect.
we
further
hold
that
such
an
invasion
of
privacy
is
not
warranted
under
the
act
when
the
request
seeks
no
official
information
about
a
government
agency
that
merely
records
that
the
government
happens
to
be
storing.
the
judgment
below
is
accordingly
reversed.
justice
blakcmun
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
the
judgment
in
which
justice
brennan
has
joined.
