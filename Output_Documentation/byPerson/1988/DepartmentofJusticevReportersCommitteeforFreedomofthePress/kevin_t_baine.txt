mr.
kevin
t.
baine
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
one
of
the
interesting
things
about
this
case
that
hasn't
been
mentioned
this
afternoon
is
that
the
government
concedes
that
we
would
be
entitled
to
any
information
about
any
financial
crimes
concerning
charles
medico.
indeed,
in
making
that
concession,
the
government
didn't
distinguish
between
convictions
and
arrests,
and
so
the
government
concedes
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
we
would
be
entitled
to
certain
information
pertaining
to
mr.
medico's
criminal
record.
the
question
is
how
the
government
can
draw
the
line
between
financial
crimes
and
other
crimes.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
important.
robert
schakne
was
assigned
by
cbs
news
to
investigate
allegations
of
corruption
that
had
been
made
against
congressman
daniel
flood
who
was
at
the
time
chairman
of
the
house
appropriations
committee.
the
u.s.
attorney
was
conducting
an
investigation
that
ultimately
led
to
flood's
indictment
on
charges
of
perjury,
bribery
and
conspiracy
to
solicit
illegal
campaign
contributions
from
potential
government
contractors.
flood
eventually
pled
guilty
to
the
conspiracy
charge.
in
the
course
of
his
investigation,
schakne
learned
that
flood
had
been
instrumental
in
arranging
defense
department
contracts
for
a
company
called
medico
industries.
and
schakne
also
learned
that
the
pennsylvania
state
crime
commission
had
found
that
medico
industries
was
a
legitimate
business
that
had
received
government
contracts
but
that
was
dominated
by
organized
crime
figures.
at
that
point
mr.
schakne
understandably
figured
he
was
onto
something.
a
powerful
congressman
was
being
investigated
by
the
federal
government
for
corruption
in
connection
with
his
dealings
with
potential
government
contractors.
and
one
of
the
government
contractors
that
he
had
been
dealing
with
was
found
by
the
pennsylvania
state
crime
commission
to
be
dominated
by
organized
crime
figures.
so,
schakne
pursued
the
story.
he
didn't
simply
report
what
he
read
in
the
crime
commission
report,
although
he
certainly
could
have
done
so,
and
if
he
had
done
so,
charles
medico
never
could
have
complained
that
his
privacy
had
been
invaded.
instead,
mr.
schakne
sought
to
confirm
the
facts
and
to
find
out
all
the
facts.
so,
he
filed
a
freedom
of
information
act
request
with
the
department
of
justice
asking
for
the
criminal
records
about
the
people...
the
criminal
records
of
the
people
who
ran
medico
industries,
the
four
medico
brothers,
william,
charles,
phillip
and
samuel.
he
asked
separately
for
convictions,
for
sentences,
for
indictments
and
arrests.
now,
the
government
has
claimed
the
privacy
exemption.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
i
believe
it
was
a
public
state
commission.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
they
reported
specifically
that
william
medico
had
been
arrested
for
murder,
that
he
had
been
convicted--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--of
bootlegging,
and
another
offense--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--they
did
not
specify
what
jurisdiction.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
we
would
have
if
we
could...
if
we
could
have.
we
did
not
know
where
to
go,
and
that's
precisely
why
we
made
the
request
of
the
justice
department.
the
government,
as
i
say,
has
claimed
the
privacy
exemption,
but
in
two
respects--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--yes.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
i
think
that
there
is
little
or
no
privacy
interest
in
either
a
conviction
or
an
arrest.
i
think
distinctions
can
be
drawn
between
the
two,
but
i
don't
think
the
distinctions
relate
to
the
concept
of
privacy.
the
government
apparently
would
concede
that
convictions
are
less
private
than
arrests.
i
would
maintain
that
there
is
little
or
no
privacy
interests
in
either.
i
would
like
to
address
both
convictions
and
arrests
in
some
detail,
but
the
difference,
if
there
is
one,
is
that
people
can
draw
perhaps
unfair
inferences
from
arrests.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
that
can
happen,
but
i
don't
think
we
can
assume
that
that
would
be
true
in
every
case.
it's
one
thing
for
states
or
legislatures
to
say
we're
going
to
err
on
the
side
of
protecting
people
who
have
been
arrested
but
not
convicted,
so
we're
going
to
adopt
a
blanket
rule
that
says
arrests
records
will
not
be
available
to
the
public
or
they
will
not
be
given
out
in
response
to
freedom
of
information
act
requests.
but,
of
course,
the
united
states
congress
has
not
done
that.
it
has
considered
a
number
of
pieces
of
proposed
legislation
that
would
have
prohibited
the
dissemination
of
arrest
records.
and--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--well,
i
think
it
depends
on
your
concept
of
privacy.
we
say
that
neither
a
conviction
record
nor
an
arrest
record
can
be
private
because
whether
it's
a
conviction
record
or
an
arrest
record,
it
is
in
fact
public
somewhere,
and
it
is
by
its
nature
public.
an
arrest
is
an
official
act.
a
law
enforcement
official
makes
an
arrest.
there
is
no
attempt
to
make
it
secret.
it
is
recorded
in
a
public
way,
and
although--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--then
it's
not
covered
by
our
lawsuit.
we
have
excluded
from
this
lawsuit
any
records
that
are
not
a
matter
of
public
record.
and,
therefore,
if
something
has
been
expunged
or
sealed,
we
don't
want
it.
it
may
be
that
if
an
arrest
record
is
expunged,
the
person
could
say
at
that
point
i
now
have
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
in
that
arrest
record.
we
wouldn't
necessarily
concede
that,
but
we
don't
choose
to
litigate
it
in
this
case.
and
so,
we
have
excluded
from
our
request...
excluded
from
the
complaint
in
this
lawsuit
any
expunged
records,
any
sealed
records,
anything
like
that.
we
are
limiting
our
request
to
records
that
are,
number
one,
by
their
very
nature
public
because
all
of
these
records
we're
talking
about
are
by
their
nature
public.
and
we
have
limited
our
request
in
another
way.
if
it's
not
a
matter
of
public
record
somewhere,
it's
not
covered
by
the
lawsuit.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
i
don't
think
the
person's
subjective
expectation
as
to
whether
the
justice
department
would
respond--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--i
think
the
question
is
whether
there
is
a
reasonable,
legitimate
expectation
that
you're
going
to
be
able
to
keep
something
secret.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
the
government--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--i
don't
think
the
question
is
simply
one
of
assessing
how
i
likely
it
is
that
someone
is
going
to
find
it.
i
think
when
you
are
convicted
of
a
crime--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--i
don't
think
so.
i
think
the
test...
i
think
when
you
are
convicted
or
when
you're
arrested
something
very
public
has
happened
to
you.
it's
public
in
fact
and
it's
public
by
its
nature.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
i
don't
think
it
can
ever
become
private.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--it
is
not
known
all
over
the
united
states,
but
it
is
by
nature
not
private,
it
is
public.
i
think
that
the
question...
we're
interpreting
the
word
"privacy".
and
we're
not
just
interpreting
a
word
that's
used
in
a
statute,
we're
interpreting
a
concept
that
congress
has
borrowed,
a
concept
that
has
been
used
in
the
common
law,
a
concept
that
has
some
grounding
in
the
fourth
amendment
and
other
areas
of
constitutional
law.
and
i
don't
think...
and
i
think
that
when
you're
defining
the
word
"privacy",
you
have
to
be
a
little
bit
careful.
you
can't
just
say
we...
we
can
define
it
the
way
we
want
it
for
this
case.
we're
dealing
with
a
concept--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--it
is...
it
is
irrelevant
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
substantial
privacy
interest
in
our
view
because--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--if
there
is
no--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--if
there
is
no
privacy
interest
whatsoever,
that
result--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--would
follow.
the
court
doesn't
have
to
hold
in
this
case
that
there
can
never
be
a
privacy
interest
in
any
criminal
record,
arrest,
conviction
or
sentencing.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
i
think
congress
has
left...
has
created
precisely
that
situation.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
well,
they
didn't
do
it
affirmatively;
they
did
it
by
not
writing
an
exemption.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
there
are
a
lot
of
things
that
are
not
exempt
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
yes.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
well,
i
want
to
emphasize
that
i
am
not
resting
my
entire
argument
on
the...
the
mere
happenstance
that
something
happens
to
be
public
somewhere.
i'm...
we're
relying
more
upon
the
nature
of
the
information.
a
conviction
is
a
public
event.
it
is
a
public
fact
in
a
person's
life.
there
may
be
a
lot
of
facts
in
the
fbi's
records.
there
may
be
facts
on
the
rap
sheet
that
are
not
by
their
nature
public.
but
the
fact
of
a
conviction
is
public,
and
it
can
never
become
private--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--i
mean
it
doesn't
concern
the
person's
private
affairs.
the
legislative--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--the
house
and
senate
reports
of
the...
of
the...
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
don't
say
a
lot
about
these
exemptions.
but
they
do
contain
references
to
intimate
details
of
a
person's
life,
highly
personal
facts,
private
affairs.
now,
in
the
department
of
state
case
against
the
washington
post,
this
court
did
suggest
in
dictum
that
information
doesn't
have
to
be
intimate
in
order
to
be
covered
by
the
privacy
exemptions,
but
surely
the
information
has
to
concern
one's
private
affairs
as
opposed
to
the
public's
business.
the
critical
fact
here
is
that
convictions
and
arrests
are
the
public's
business.
and
you
don't
have
to
rely
simply
upon
the
fact
that
it
happens
to
be
in
a
public
record.
we
all
know
that
the...
that
the
steps...
the
formal
steps
in
the
criminal
process
are
by
their
nature
public.
when...
consider
what
we're
talking
about
here.
representatives
of
the
public
pass
criminal
laws
for
the
protection
of
the
public.
public
officials,
police
officials,
make
a
determination
that
a
crime
has
been
committed
and
that
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
that
someone
committed.
so,
they
make
an
arrest.
members
of
the
public
sitting
in
a
grand
jury
return
an
indictment.
a
public
prosecutor
prosecutes
the
case
before
a
judge,
in
front
of
members
of
the
public
sitting
as
a
jury,
and
then,
when
we're
taking
about
convictions,
the
public
issues
its
formal
condemnation
of
the
individual
for
breaking
the
criminal
law.
that's
what
a
conviction
is.
how
can
a
conviction
ever
be
private?
it
is
the
public's
formal
condemnation
of
the
person.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
well,
if
that
is
the
government's
position,
i
think
the
government
should
respond
to
the
portion
of
our
request
that
asks
for
convictions
by
either
saying
there
are
no
convictions
or
there
are
convictions,
here
they
are.
the
government
has
acknowledge
that
certain
categories
of
crimes
we
would
be
entitled
to
information
about,
but
they
won't
tell
us
whether
there
are
any
convictions
in
charles
medico's
records.
so,
convictions
are
a
part
of
this
case.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
well,
i
agree--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--i
agree
with
much
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
said.
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
is
that
the
states
in
general
have
made
determinations
that
these
are
matters
of
public
interest,
and
that's
why--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--i
just
don't
think
the
court
has
to...
has
to
fight
that
battle
in
this
case.
there
may
be--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--i
must
confess
that
the
line
i'm
giving
you
is
dictated
in
part
by
what
this
court
said
in
department
of
state
against
the
washington
post
case.
the
opinion
in
that
case
does
contain
some
suggestions
that
the
mere
fact
that
something
happens
to
be
contained
in
a
public
record
somewhere
will
not
necessarily
be
dispositive.
i'm
trying
to
deal
with
that
fact,
and
i'm
trying
to
recognize
that
there
may
well
be
aspects
of
a
person's
private
affairs
that
happen
to
be
on
a
record
that
is
available
somewhere,
and
that
may
not
necessarily
transform
that
basically
private
fact
into
a
basically
public
fact.
but
we're
talking
about
criminal
convictions,
criminal
sentences,
indictments,
arrests
which
are
inherently
by
their
very
nature
public
facts.
congress
has
had
the
opportunity
and
it
has
considered
or
numerous
occasions
whether
or
not
it
should
adopt
legislation
to
prohibit
the
dissemination
of
arrest
records.
congress
has
never
passed
such
a
law.
the
fact
is
that
there
may
well
be
reasons
to
pass
such
a
law.
it
may
well
be
that
a
judgment
would
be
made
that
in
many
cases
unfair
inferences
might
be
drawn
from
arrest
records
in
cases
that
did
not
result
in
convictions.
but
apparently
some
people
think
that
it's
not
always
unfair
to
draw
inferences
from
arrest
records.
we
don't
prohibit
from...
employers
from
asking
prospective
employees
about
whether
they've
been
arrested.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
exactly.
i
think
the
unfairness
doesn't...
the
fact
that
it
may
be
unfair
in
a
particular
case
doesn't
mean
that
it's
private
in
that
case.
and
it
certainly
doesn't
mean
that
it's
generally
private.
the
government
suggests
that
the
fact
that
somehow
this
information
is
contained
in
a
data
bank
makes
a
difference.
there
is
no
question
that
government
data
banks
can
present
issues
of
privacy.
sometimes
the
government
can
collect
so
much
information
about
an
individual's
private
life,
that
it
puts
it
all
together
and
it
enables
someone
who
has
access
to
that
to
put
together
a
profile
that
reveals
a
great
deal
about
the
person's
private
life,
about
his
spending
habits,
about
his
interests,
about
his
personal
relationships.
but
we're
not
asking
the
government
for
all
of
the
information
that
it
has
about
charles
medico.
we
have
limited
our
request
to
information
that
is
by
its
nature
public.
that
information
does
not
become
private
simply
because
it's
transported
from
some
courthouse
in
pennsylvania
to
a
building
in
washington,
d.c.
the
information
remains
inherently
public.
the
fact
that
it
is
now
a
little
bit
easier
to
find
the
information
may
be
a
convenience
to
robert
schakne.
that's
one
of
the
reasons
i
think
for
the
freedom
of
information
act,
to
make
information
accessible.
but
it
doesn't
make
information
private.
our
position
in
this
case
is
simply
this.
as
a
general
matter,
an
individual
has
no
substantial
privacy
interest
in
his
criminal
record.
we
don't
think
he
has
any
privacy
interest
in
his
criminal
record.
but
all
the
court
has
to
recognize
is
that
as
a
general
matter,
there
is
little
or
no
privacy
interest
in
one's
criminal
record.
in
this
case,
if
charles
medico
had
any
substantial
privacy
interest
in
his
criminal
record
to
begin
with,
he
lost
it
when
he
became
a
defense
contractor
with
the
help
of
corrupt
congressmen,
and
if
he
had
any
privacy
interests
left
in
his
criminal
record
at
that
point,
he
lost
it
when
the
pennsylvania
crime
commission
issued
a
report
saying
that
his
company
was
dominated
by
organized
crime.
at
that
point,
if
not
before,
the
public
had
a
legitimate
interest
in
knowing
all
there
was
to
know
about
charles
medico's
criminal
record
and
about
the
criminal
associations
of
all
of
the
people--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--i
don't
agree
entirely.
i
don't
agree--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--on
the
privacy
side
of
the
balance,
i
don't
agree
that
the
government
has
to
determine
whether
in
each
case
the
particular
jurisdiction
from
which
the
records
came
makes
those
records
publicly
available.
the
fact
is
we
know
that
these
records
are
publicly
available
in
virtually
every
jurisdiction.
i
don't
know
of
any
jurisdiction
that
doesn't
make
them--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--on
the
public
interest
side,
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
to
this
extent.
the
court
of
appeals
said
it's
impossible
to
judge
the
public
interest
in
a
particular
request,
and
all
you
can
do
is
balance
the
general
interest
underlying
the
freedom
of
information
act,
on
the
one
hand,
against
the
specific
reason
or
the
specific
privacy
interest.
i
don't
know
how
you'd
conduct
such
a
balance
to
balance
a
general
public
interest,
on
the
one
hand,
against
a
very
specific
private
interest.
it
seems
to
me
when
you're
conducting
this
balance,
you're
really
trying
to
find
out
whether
the
information
that
the
requestor
is
driving
at
is
basically
private
or
basically
public.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
well,
we
disagree
on
the
outcome.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
and--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
result,
and
there
would
be
no
point
in
a
remand
because
although
the
court
of
appeals
said
we
don't
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
particular
reason
for
the
request,
it
went
ahead
and
applied
our
test
anyway.
and
it
said
we
win
under
any
test.
it
said
when
you
look
at
the
particular
request
here,
the
government
is
completely
unable
to
explain
to
us
how
this
information
would
not
promote
the
basic
policy
of
foia,
namely,
to
inform
people
about
the
affairs
of
government.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
has
answered
the
question
under
any
test.
and
if
you
agree
with
my
way
of
looking
at
things,
you
have
to
affirm.
i
don't
think
either
of
us
is
seeking
a
remand.
i
don't
think
there's
any
point
in
a
remand
at
this
point.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
it
doesn't
tell
you
anything
about
the
fbi.
it
tells--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--it
tells
you
about
whether
the
defense
department
is
giving
contracts
to
organized
crime.
it
tells
you
about
whether
or
not
a
congressman
is
arranging
government
contracts
for
a
company
that's
dominated
by
organized
crime.
and
i
think
the
public
has
an
interest
in
the
answers
to
both
of
those
questions.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
well,
i'm
not...
one
of
the
reasons
behind
foia
is
to
enable
the
public
to
find
out
for
itself
what
the
facts
are
and
not
necessarily
to
rely
upon
some
crime
commission
report
from
pennsylvania.
what
it
said
was
that
the
company
was
dominated
by
organized
crime
figures.
some
people
are
a
little
bit
careless
when
they
talk
about
whether
a
company
is
dominated
by
organized
crime
figures,
and
they
didn't
give
a
lot
of
detail.
mr.
schakne
was
interested
in
detail.
he
wanted
to
find
out
for
sure
whether
or
not
there
was
something
to
this
report
and,
if
so,
just
what
there
was.
the
government
is
really
espousing
a
view
of
privacy
here
which
says
that
if
something
is
embarrassing,
it's
private.
as
the
court
of
appeals
said,
that
argument
simply
proves
too
much.
there
are
many
things
that
are
embarrassing,
but
they're
not
at
all
private.
we
say
that
there
has
to
be
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
before
someone
can
claim
a
privacy
interest.
that's
basically
what's
required
under
the
fourth
amendment
cases.
that's
what's
required
under
the
common
law
cases
involving
invasion
of
privacy.
and
we
can
think
of
no
other
reason
why,
when
the
court
is
construing
the
concept
of
privacy
in
the
freedom
of
information
act,
it
should
adopt
any
different
test.
i
think
it's
somewhat
surprising
that
in...
in
the
government's
reply
brief,
they
seem
to
reject
that
test.
they
seem
to
reject
the
notion
that
the
test
is
whether
or
not
there's
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy,
now,
we
think
that
is
the
test,
and
we
think
there
is
no
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
in
one's
criminal
record.
and,
of
course,
i
want
to
emphasize
again
we're
not
dealing
in
this
case
with
criminal
records
in
the
abstract.
we're
dealing
with
the
criminal
records
of
a
man
named
charles
medico,
a
principal
of
a
defense
contractor
that
got
its
contracts
with
the
help
of
a
congressman
convicted
of
conspiracy
to
solicit
illegal
campaign
contributions
from
government
contractors,
a
principal
of
a
government
contractor
that
was
found
to
be
dominated
by
organized
crime.
and
those
facts
reduce
any
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
that
mr.
medico
might
have
had
in
his
criminal
record.
when
the
pennsylvania
crime
commission
came
out,
mr.
medico
should
have
expected
the
attention
of
prosecutors,
the
fbi,
congressional
committees
and
the
like.
to
suggest
that
a
reporter's
request
for
his
criminal
record
at
that
point
was
an
intrusion
into
his
right
to
be
let
alone
i
think
simply
ignores
the
facts.
now,
the
government
concedes
that
there's
a
public
interest
in
finding
out
whether
charles
medico
had
been
convicted
or
even
arrested
of
a
financial
crime.
but
nowhere
does
the
government
explain
to
us
why
the
public
has
an
interest
in
that
kind
of
information
but
not
information
on
other
kinds
of
crimes.
why,
for
example,
would
the
public
have
an
interest
in
knowing
whether
charles
medico
was
arrested
for
a
financial
crime
but
not
in
knowing
whether
or
not
he
had
been
arrested
or
even
convicted
of
murder,
racketeering,
tax
evasion,
mail
fraud,
or
weapons
violations?
we're
dealing
with
a
contract
that...
contractor
that
sold
missile
parts
and
tank
parts
to
the
federal
government.
we
say
that
given
the
relationship
of
the
medicos
to
congressman
flood
and
given
the
fact
that
their
company
had
been
found
to
be
dominated
by
organized
crime,
the
public
was
entitled
to
know
whatever
there
was
to
know
about
the
criminal
associations
of
these
people.
as
the
court
of
appeals
put
it...
and
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
on
this
point...
it's
surely
up
to
the
citizenry,
once
informed,
to
determine
the
relevance
of
whatever
criminal
record
there
may
be.
the
government's
position
is,
yes,
there's
a
public
interest
in
knowing
what
kind
of
people
these
were.
yes,
there's
a
public
interest
in
knowing
whether
or
not
they
were
convicted
of
financial
crimes,
but
we,
the
government,
will
decide
or
the
court
will
decide,
based
on
an
in
camera
submission,
how
probative
or
significant
a
particular
piece
of
information
is.
we
say
that's
wrong.
we
say
it's
wrong
because
the
whole
idea
of
foia
is
to
give
information
to
the
public
and
to
let
the
public
decide
for
itself
whether
its
government
is
functioning
as
it
should.
that's
not
to
say
that
it's
always
up
to
the
public
to
make
the
final
assessment
of
the
public
interest.
but
when,
as
in
this
case,
there
is
concededly
a
legitimate
public
interest
in
certain
type
of
information,
namely,
information
about
a
person's
criminal
history,
the
public
should
have
the
opportunity
to
take
a
look
at
the
information
and
to
weigh
the
significance
of
each
particular
place
of
information.
when
the
court
decides
that
issue
on
its
own
on
the
basis
of
an
in
camera
submission,
the
adversarial
process
is
compromised.
in
this
case
the
party
advocating
the
public
interest
is
at
a
disadvantage.
once
again,
that's
not
to
say
you
can
never
have
in
camera
review.
but
i
think
in
camera
review
is
a
singularly
inappropriate
way
to
resolve
issues
of
the
public
interest.
i
think
it's
difficult
enough
for
the
court
to
weigh
what
the
public
interest
is
in
any
of
these
cases,
but
to
do
it
on
its
own
without
any
help
from
the
public
itself
i
think
is
especially
difficult.
it's
going
to
be
awfully
difficult
for
a
court
to
sit
there
and
speculate
on
its
own
looking
at
each
piece
of
information
how
the
public
might
use
this
fact,
that
fact
and
that
fact.
that's
what
the
district
court
did.
it
said,
as
the
government
says,
there
is
a
public
interest
in
general
in
this
kind
of
information
in
this
kind
of
case,
but
taking
a
look
at
the
particular
facts
that
are
in
the
sealed
envelope,
we
don't
think
those
facts
are
particularly
relevant
to
the
story
that
mr.
schakne
might
want
to
do.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
had
it
right
when
it
said
that
kind
of
a
judgment
is
a
judgment
for
editors
or
for
members
of
the
public,
but
not
for
judges.
a
particular
piece
of
information
that
is
seemingly
unimportant
to
the
judge
may
be
very
important
to
the
person
who
requests
it
and
very
important
to
the
public,
very
important
to
the
people
who
have
a
fuller
understanding
of
the
facts.
and
even
the
fact
that
there
is
no
significant
crime
in
charles
medico's
past
may
be
of
legitimate
interest
in
a
case
like
this.
the
pennsylvania
crime
commission
raised
serious
questions
about
this
company
over
whether
it
was
suitable
and
fit
to
be
a
government
contractor.
if
those
questions
were
unfounded
or
if
they
were
exaggerated,
the
public
had
an
interest
in
knowing
that.
and,
of
course,
if
the
record
shows
that
there
are
only
minor
offenses
in
charles
medico's
criminal
past,
disclosure
of
that
fact
is
not
going
to
cause
any
serious
embarrassment
to
a
person
who
has
already
been
linked
to
organized
crime
in
an
official
report.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
i
think
the
court
does
have
to
ask
and
perhaps
the
justice
department
has
to
ask
the
requestor
why
do
you
want
this
information.
and
if
the
requestor,
as
in
this
case,
can
articulate
a
legitimate
public
interest,
that
has
to
be
weighed.
i
don't
think
the
court
in
this
case
has
to
write
a
treatise
explaining
everything
that
might
be
a
conceivably
important
public
interest.
but
no
one
disputes...
the
government
doesn't
even
dispute...
that
the
public
interest
that
we've
articulated
is
a
legitimate
one.
and
so,
once
you
have
a
legitimate
public
interest
and
a
very
minimal
privacy
interest,
if
any
privacy
interest,
i
say
that
the
requestor
is
entitled
to
the
information
and
the
court
should
not
do
what
the
district
court
did
and
what
the
government
would
ask
this
court
to
do,
go
through
the
records
page
by
page,
line
by
line,
and
decide
what's
probative
and
what's
not
probative,
what's
significant
and
what's
not
significant.
i
think
that's
wrong
because
it
imposes
a
tremendous
burden
on
the
justice
department
and
on
the
courts,
but
i
think
it's
wrong
more
importantly
because
i
think
those
judgments
are
judgments
that
the
public
should
be
able
to
make
on
their
own
once
they're
given
the
relevant
facts.
thank
you.
