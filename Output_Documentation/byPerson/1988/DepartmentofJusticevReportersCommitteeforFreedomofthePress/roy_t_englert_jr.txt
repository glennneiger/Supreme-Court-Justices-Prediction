mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
an
fbi
rap
sheet
is
exempt
from
the
mandatory
public
disclosure
provisions
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
on
the
ground
that
its
disclosure
could
reasonably
be
expected
to
constitute
an
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy
within
the
meaning
of
exemption
7(c).
our
position
is
that
in
this
case
and
in
many
similar
cases,
the
information
should
be
held
exempt.
the
particular
information
at
issue
in
this
case
pertains
to
a
man
named
charles
medico
and
consists
of
any
information
known
to
the
fbi
or
the
justice
department
regarding
arrests,
indictments,
acquittals,
convictions
or
sentences
of
mr.
medico.
the
request
was
made
in
1978
and
was,
in
pertinent
part,
denied
by
the
department.
in
1979
the
respondents
sued
at
this
point
purporting
to
limit
their
request
to
matters
of
public
record.
the
district
court,
after
examining
the
records,
if
any,
in
camera,
upheld
the
government's
position
holding
after
de
novo
review
that
there
would,
indeed,
be
an
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
relying
primarily
on
respondent's
purported
limitation
of
the
request
to
matters
of
public
record,
which
the
court
of
appeals
said
greatly
reduced
any
cognizable
privacy
interest.
judge
starr
dissented
and
was
joined
in
dissenting
from
the
denial
of
rehearing
en
banc
by
judges
bork,
buckley
and
sentelle.
most,
though
not
all,
of
the
records
that
would
be
responsive
to
respondent's
request
are
records
of
the
identification
division
of
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation.
the
identification
division
has
some
25
million
arrest
records
that
potentially
could
be
affected
by
the
decision
in
this
case.
those
records
generally
come
in
in
the
form
of
fingerprint
data
submitted
by
the
states
in
connection
with
an
arrest
or
some
other
state
proceeding
that
causes
the
state
to
be
interested
in
the
identity,
fingerprints
and
criminal
record
of
an
individual.
it
is
generally
not
the
case,
because
there
is
no
reason
for
it
to
be
the
case,
that
the
states
tell
the
fbi
whether
this
information
is
public
anywhere
in
the
state,
and
the
fbi
has
never
had
any
reason
to
ask
that
information.
by
providing
centralized
access
to
this
compiled
fingerprint
information
on
individuals,
the
fbi
makes
available
to
the
law
enforcement
community,
which
the
identification
division
was
formed
to
serve,
a
great
deal
of
information
that
could
not
practically
be
obtained
otherwise.
the
records
that
are
available
in
local
jurisdictions
generally
are
not
indexed
by
name.
they're
generally
cumulative
police
blotters
and
things
of
that
sort
that
are
only
useful
if
you
know
the
precise
date
that
you
want
to
look
at
in
order
to
find
a
particular
piece
of
information.
they
are
generally
not
indexed
by
name
and
can't
be
accessed
on
that
basis.
the
point
of
the
fbi's
rap
sheet
system
is
to
make
information
available
on
the
basis
of
names,
fingerprints
and
other
identifying
information.
this
is,
of
course,
very
helpful
to
law
enforcement
as
it
should
be,
but
we
think
it's
equally
obvious
that
it
also
has
a
great
potential
for
mischief
if
this
kind
of
information
should
be
given
to
someone
who
doesn't
use
it
responsibly.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
we
certainly
do
think
that
there
is
a
basis
for
drawing
such
a
distinction,
your
honor.
and
in
the
balancing
process
that
properly
informs
the
decision
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
whether
to
release
this
information,
of
course,
one
would
more
readily
release
conviction
information
than
arrest
information.
that
is
not
to
say
that
all
conviction
information
should
always
be
released.
we
don't
think
it
should
by
any
means.
but
a
conviction
for
murder
yesterday
obviously
raises
less
of
a
privacy
interest
and
it
has
more
of
a
public
interest
than
a
conviction
for...
or
an
arrest,
rather,
for
stealing
bread
30
years
ago.
the
court
of
appeals
denied
that.
we
don't
see
how...
how
that
can
be
reasonably
disputed.
now,
the
identification
division's
records
are
shared
outside
of
the
criminal
justice
community
to
some
extent.
they
are
shared
pursuant
to
specific
statutory
authority
either
by
congress,
which
has
made
the
decision
that
this
information
should
be
shared
with
the
nuclear
power,
securities
and
commodities
industries,
as
well
as
the
banking
industry,
or
pursuant
to
state
statutes
that
allow
the
sharing
of
information
for
licensing
functions
and
employment
and
the
like
and
that
had
been
approved
by
the
attorney
general.
general
public
access
is
an
entirely
different
matter.
congress
has
certainly
never
passed
a
statute
specific
to
criminal
history
records
that
provide
for
general
public
access
to
these
records.
we
don't
contend,
on
the
other
hand,
before
this
court
that
congress
has
ever
passed
a
statute
that
generally
forbids
access
to
criminal
information
records.
the
d.c.
circuit
once
suggested
the
statute
congress
had
passed
should
be
interpreted
that
way,
but
the
d.c.
circuit...
now
it
apparently
takes
the
opposite
view.
so--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--i
think
the
courts
do
have
to
develop...
i
wouldn't
call
it
common
law,
but
have
to
fill
in
the
terms
of
the
very
general
statute,
yes,
your
honor.
that--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
i
can
understand
the
court's
discomfort
in
making
that
determination,
but
unless
the
court
is
prepared
to
hold
the
freedom
of
information
act
unconstitutional,
there
is
no
doubt
that
that's
the
determination--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--it
has
been
read
that
way
by
the
court
below.
we
don't
think
that's
an
accurate
reading
of
congress'
intent.
we
don't
think
it's
an
accurate
reading
of
this
court's
decision
in
department
of
the
air
force
v.
rose.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
we...
we
do
think
this
inquiry
should
be
channeled
to
some
extent
by
locking
to
the
purposes
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
itself
which
is
to
open
the
functions
of
government
to
public
scrutiny.
information
about
someone
who
was
recently
nominated
to
the
cabinet,
for
example,
is
of
much
greater
interest,
much
greater
legitimate
public
interest,
than
information
about
my
next
door
neighbor
who
lives
in
quiet
anonymity.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
the
justice
department
would
make
that
judgment,
and
the
courts
reviewing
de
novo
would
have
to
make
that
judgment.
that
is
we
think
beyond
much
rational
dispute
the
task
that
congress
has
assigned
to
the
courts
for
better
or
for
worse.
if
that
is,
indeed,
a
task
beyond
the
capability
of
the
courts,
then
we
have
a
very
real
problem
of
inability
to
protect
private
information.
and
i'm
not
sure
that
the
solution
is
the
one
that
the
court
of
appeals
adopted
which
is
essentially
to
throw
all
sorts
of
things
open.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
that's
a
very
helpful
analogy.
this
court
in
cases
like
rankin
v.
mcpherson
has
assigned
to
the
courts
the
task
of
determining
whether
something
is
a
matter
of
public
concern.
and
this
is
a
task
on
which
the
courts
are
already
engaged
and
long
have
been
engaged.
and
it
is
a
task
on
which
the
courts
are
engaged
in
furtherance
of
the
first
amendment
not
in
derogation
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
no
doubt
that
congress
intended
for
better
or
for
worse
that
courts
balance
the
public
interest
against
the
privacy
interest.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
indication
by
congress
of
a
relationship
between
that
doctrine
and
the
freedom
of
information
act,
but
i
think
it's
an
obviously
helpful
analogy
when
courts
do
embark
on
this
task.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
your
honor,
our
position
most
emphatically
is,
no,
it
should
not,
that
every
requestor
has
the
same
rights
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
as
a
general
proposition.
there
is
at
least
one
exception
to
that
rule,
as
we
learned
last
term
in
department
of
justice
v.
julian,
but
that
pertained
to
an
individual's
request
for
information
about
himself
and
was
not
a
suggestion
that
the...
that
in
departure
from
the
general
sears
roebuck
principle
and
robbins
tire
principle
that
that...
and
epa
v.
mink
principle,
that
the
identity
of
the
requestor
is
generally
irrelevant.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
as
part
of
the
public
interest
determination,
i...
i
think
they
can
not
that
any
one
requestor
gets
it
for
his
purpose
and
any
other
requestor
doesn't
get
it
for
a
different
purpose.
i
think
really
the
most
helpful
analysis
at
this
point
is
in
a
opinion
by
judge
leventhal
for
the
d.c.
circuit
quite
some
time
ago,
ditiow
v.
shultz,
in
which
he
pointed
out
that
the
legislative
history
of
this
act
means...
says
that
it
was
meant
to
open
up
information
to
the
public,
not
to
select
individuals,
but
that
the
use
to
which
particular
information
might
be
put
by
that
individual
is
a
part
of
the
public
interest.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
your
honor,
the
justice
department--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--well,
and
we
would
expect
to
conform
to
the
rule
of
law,
your
honor,
just
as
newspapers
which
can
cause
terrible
harm
to
individuals
by
making
wrong
judgments
about
this
sort
of
thing
can
try
to
conform
their
actions
to
the
rule
of
law
based
on
what
this
court
says
about
what
is...
and
other
courts
say
about
what
it
is
and
what
is
not
in
the
public
interest.
this
is
not
a
request
for
discretion,
unbridled
or
otherwise,
on
the
part
of
the
justice
department.
it
is
merely
an
assertion
that
congress
has
assigned
to
the
justice
department
and
to
the
courts
the
task
of
assessing
the
public
interest
in
particular
disclosures,
and
that
that
is
the
function
the
court
should
carry
out.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
your
honor,
with
just
that
information,
we...
we
ordinarily
couldn't.
if...
if
one
is
a
recent
arrest
and
one
is
old...
i
mean,
i
would
hope
we
would
not
give
either
out,
but--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--we...
we
should
not.
we
should
treat
similarly
situated
people
the
same.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
based
just
on--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--we
will
make
choices
between
different
situations
involving
different
facts.
we
would
hope
not
to
have--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--arbitrary
choices--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--well,
an
example
i
used
earlier.
if...
if
there
was
a
publicized
murder
conviction
yesterday,
there
would
be
very
little
privacy
interests
remaining
in
that
compared
to
an
obscure
arrest
that
was
never
prosecuted
for
disorderly
conduct
30
or
40
or
50
years
ago.
that's
the
kind
of
distinction
that--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--your
honor,
the
balancing
test
is
between
the
public
interest
and
the
privacy
interest
of
the
individual.
there's
no
governmental
interest
as
such--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--we
certainly
would
hope
to
act
in
a
manner
consistent
with
the
public
interest.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
in...
in
appropriate
situations.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
it's
subject--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
it's
subject
to
de
novo
review
by
the
courts.
so,
obviously
we
do
bear
the
potential--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--as...
as
they
do,
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out
in
public
figure
cases.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that's
correct.
as
they
also
do
in--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
as
is
also
done
in
grand
jury
cases
under
rule
6(e).
the
courts
have
a
long
history
of
determining
whether
there
is
or
is
not
public
interest
in
particular
information,
and
we
don't
see
why
this
case
in
which
congress
has
assigned
the
courts
and
the
agency
that
task
should
be
any
different
from
those
other
cases.
indeed,
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out,
the
mandate
to
do
so
seems
to
be
more
explicit
in
this
case
than
in
some
of
the
other
cases
in
which
the--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--it
is
not
totally
ad
hoc,
your
honor.
we
do
have
some
processing
guidelines
at
least
within
the
department
of
justice.
now,
i'm
not
familiar--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--i
would
certainly
think
so.
i
don't--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--as
far
as
i
know,
they're
not
in
the
record.
that's
right.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
name
or
other
identifying
information.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
it's
a
very
helpful
rule
if
applied
at
a
sufficient
level
of
generality.
one
of
the
major
problems
we
have
with
the
approach
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
apparently
wants
us
in
the
name
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
to
go
find
out
in
each
and
every
instance
where
and
how
the
record
is
kept,
an
entirely
novel
requirement
of
making
the
agency
do
research.
if
the
point
is,
however,
that
because
criminal
justice
records
when...
when
available
at
the
original
source,
which
of
course
they
aren't
always,
are
generally
not
kept
by
name,
that
would,
indeed,
be
consistent
with
at
least
one
indication
of
the
intent
of
congress
in
the
privacy
act
which
suggests
that
there
is
a...
there
is
a
much
greater
privacy
interest
in
information
that
can
be
retrieved
by
name
than
in
the
kind
of
obscure
information
that
is
available
on
police
blotters.
so,
i
would...
i
would
welcome
that
suggestion
as--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--it's
not
matter
of
tedium
your
honor.
it's
a
matter
of...
of...
one
is
a
question
of
judgment.
we
know,
often
on
the
basis
of
information
provided
to
us,
that
somebody
is
or
is
not
famous.
we
know
on
the
basis
cf
the
records
that
his
alleged
crimes
are
or
are
not
old.
we
know
that
they
did
or
did
not
result
in
prosecution,
a
very
important
point.
what
we
don't
know,
with
respect
to
any
particular
record,
is
what
the
disposition
practices
and
what
the
availability
practices
are
at
the...
at
the
original
source.
for
example,
one
of
the
entries
on
william
medico's
rap
sheet,
which
was
disclosed,
shows
that
he
was
arrested
for
suspicion
of
murder
on
november
8,
1928.
it
shows
nothing...
no
further
action
was
taken
on
that.
how
are
we
supposed
to
find
out
the
availability
of
that
1928
record
in
wyoming,
pennsylvania?
we
can
always
ask,
and
they
can
check
their
archives
or
something.
but
it's
a
task
that
we
don't
think
the
freedom
of
information
act
assigns
to
us.
it
does
assign
to
us
and
assigns
to
the
courts
reviewing
de
novo
the
task
of
making
judgments
on
the
basis
of
the
available
information.
it's
a
very
different
task.
the
primary
argument
that
is
made
by
my
opponents
here
today
is
there
can
be
no
privacy
interest
in
these
records
because
they
are,
as
a
general
matter,
public
at
the
originating
jurisdiction.
that
assigns
a
meaning
to
privacy
which
we
don't
think
is
the
meaning
congress
had
for
that
term.
exemption
7(c)
was
passed
in
1974
which
was
a
time
of
extraordinary
interest
among
commentators,
courts
and
congress
in
the
invasions
of
privacy
that
can
be
occasioned
by
the
widespread
release
of
criminal
history
information.
congress
held
hearings
on
this
subject
in
1971,
1973
and
1974.
at
that
those
hearings,
there
was
much
comment
on
the
invasion
of
privacy
that
could
be
occasioned
by
disseminating
these
records
even
though
they
may
be
publicly
available
at
the
originating
jurisdiction.
forty-two
u.s.c.
3789(g)
was
passed
in
1973.
congress
explicitly
commanded,
as
a
condition
of
funding
state
and
local
collection
of
this
information,
that
the
security
and
privacy
of
this
information
be
maintained.
the
privacy
act
was
contemporaneous
with
this
amendment
to
the
freedom
of
information
act
of
1974.
it...
its
legislative
history,
as
judge
starr
pointed
out
in
dissent,
shows
a
congressional
concern
with
compilations
of
data
and,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
it...
on
its
face
it
shows
a
concern
with
information
that
is
retrievable
by
name
which
decidedly
is
not,
for
the
most
part,
the
information
we're
talking
about
here.
states
do
compile
this
information
for
their
own
purposes
and
make
it
retrievable
by
name,
but
as
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
search
group
points
out,
47
out
of
the
50
states
have
statutes
that
forbid
dissemination
of
this
information.
now,
i
should
hasten
to
say
congress
has
not
passed
a
statute
that
in
terms
forbids
the
dissemination
of
this
information.
congress
has
only
passed
a
statute
that
says
its
law
enforcement
records
are
exempt
from
disclosure
if
that
disclosure
could
reasonably
be
expected
to
constitute
an
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
congress
has
commanded
that...
that
collection
in
28
u.s.c.
534.
but
the
disclosure
is
governed
by
the
freedom
of
information
act.
before
1974,
the
d.c.
circuit
had
interpreted
exemption
7
to
mean
all
law
enforcement
records
were
exempt,
and
the
general
assumption
was
that
all
rap
sheets
were
exempt
for
that
reason.
after
menard
v.
mitchell,
the
assumption
was
that
28
u.s.c.
534,
which
provides
for
cancellation
of
the
exchange
with
states,
if
the
information
is
misused,
was
an
exemption
3
statute.
the
courts
in
the
district
of
columbia
held
that
repeatedly.
they
held
again
that
this
information
was
not
accessible.
now,
we're
in
an
era
in
which
the
only
question
left
seems
to
be
invasion
of
privacy,
but
we
should
not
let
the
pendulum
swing
all
the
other
way,
as
the
d.c.
circuit
has
in
this
case,
and
say
because
congress
hasn't
explicitly
forbidden
the
disclosure
of
this
information
in
all
instances,
it
should
be
made
available
in
virtually
all
instances.
now,
respondents
do
say
that
there
is
a
particular
public
interest
in
this
case
because
there
are
connections
to
a
corrupt
congressman
and
a
defense
contractor
allegedly
dominated
by
an
organized
crime
figure.
the
problem
with
their
argument
on
the
facts
of
this
case
is
that
it
relies
on
too
many
tenuous
inferences.
the
information
requested
is
about
charles
medico,
not
daniel
flood.
daniel
flood
was
a
member
of
congress
who
was
the
subject
of
mr.
schakne's
investigation,
but
mr.
schakne
didn't
request
information
on
flood.
this
is
about
charles
medico.
charles
medico
is
a
principal
of
medico
industries,
but
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
any
connection
between
charles
medico
and
organized
crime
other
than
having
brothers
who
were
allegedly
connected
to
organized
crime.
to
say
that
everything
about
charles
medico
should
be
made
publicly
available
and
is
a
matter
of
great
public
interest
just
on
those
facts
carries
matters
way
too
far.
we
are
discussing
7(c)
not
exemption
6
here.
there
is
a
difference
between
those
two
exemptions.
under
exemption
c
what
we
have
to
show
is
the
disclosure
could
reasonably
be
expected
to
constitute
an
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy
as
opposed
to
our
burden
under
exemption
6
to
show
that
disclosure
would
constitute
a
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy.
congress
in
1974
in
passing
exemption
7(c)
and
in
1976
in
broadening
exemption
c
intended
to
put
an
additional
thumb
on
the
scale
against
disclosure
of
law
enforcement
records.
all
our
position
has
to
be
to
be
upheld
here
is
reasonable,
a
reasonable
expectation.
respondents
disagree
with
us
about
whether
there
would
be
an
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy
in
this
case.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
think
that's
a
very
reasonable
expectation
on
the
part
of
the
individual,
your
honor.
there
are--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--well,
again,
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--i
think
this
is
what
congress
meant
by
the
term
42
u.s.c.
3789
(g)
did
refer
to
this
interest
as
a
privacy
interest.
i
think
that's
also
suggested
by
the
courts
in
the
washington
post
case
and
by
judge
lombard's
concurrence
in
the
court
below
in
the
washington
post
case
where
judge
lombard
pointed
out
that
citizenship
information,
although
publicly
available
somewhere,
could
be
difficult
to
locate,
and
that
that
was
important.
and
this
court
in
reversing
the
d.c.
circuit's
judgment
that
the
information
had
to
be
disclosed
said
that
the
fact
that
the
information
was
publicly
available
somewhere
is
not
decisive,
but
may
be
a
factor
to
be
considered
under
all
the
circumstances.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--principally,
yes.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
your
honor,
that's
obviously
within
the
discretion
of
the
court.
we
would
like
the
court
to
resolve
this
case.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
it
would
be
rare.
on
the
other
hand,
it's
rare
that
this
court
would
be
remanding
to
a
case
that
claims
it
is
unable
to
perform
the
task
that
has
been
assignee
to
it.
thank
you.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
it
may
well
be
true
that
convictions
should
be
disclosed
a
very
substantial
portion
of
the
time.
we
do
not
concede,
as
mr.
baine
suggested,
there
can
never
be
a
privacy
interest
in
convictions.
let
me
just
give
you
a
hypothetical
freedom
of
information
act
request.
please
give
me
all
publicly
available
records
on
convictions
of
jean
valjean.
and
we
find
out
that
many,
many
years
ago
he
was
convicted
of
stealing
some
bread.
it
seems
to
me
he
still
has
some
substantial
residuum
of
a
privacy
interest
in
that
record.
a
ruling
by
this
court
that
there's
no
expectation
of
privacy
in
compiled
criminal
history
records
would
come
as
a
very
great
surprise
to
the
states.
mr.
baine
says
every
jurisdiction
makes
them
available.
that
may
be
true.
it's
also
true
that
every
jurisdiction
sharply
restricts
their
availability
in
compiled
form.
to
say
that
they
should
be
available
in
compiled
form
because
every
state
makes
them
available
in
uncompiled
form
is
quite
contrary
to
the
actual
policy
of
the
states.
according
to
mr.
baine,
the
world
is
divided
into
things
that
are
public
and
things
that
are
private,
and
never
the
twain
shall
meet.
it
doesn't
work
that
way.
bankruptcies
are
fundamentally
public
events.
but
under
the
fair
credit
reporting
act,
they
can't
be
reported
after
seven
years.
chief
justice
rehnquist
gave
an
example
to
his
kansas
lectures
of
the
license
plates
of
someone
who
parks
at
a
bar
every
night.
those
are
certainly
available
to
the
public,
and
yet
we
would
think
there
was
some
kind
of
invasion
of
privacy
if
the
government
came
to
that
bar
every
night
and
recorded
the
license
plates.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
the
answer
to
the
question,
your
honor,
is--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--yes,
you
would
have
a
privacy
interest.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
there
would
be
a
countervailing
public
interest
of
enormous
magnitude.
that's
why
our
position
that
embarrassing
facts
are
what
congress
intended
to
protect
doesn't
prove
too
much.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
it
only
proves
that
you
always
consider
these
interests
and
take
into
account
the
countervailing
interest
on
the
other
side.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
for
purposes
of
this
statute,
i
think
they're
very
similar.
this
court
emphasized
in
washington
post
the
language
from
the
house
report
that
congress
intended
in
exemption
6
to
protect
against
the
disclosure
of
files
whose
disclosure
might
harm
the
individual.
that's
what
congress
meant
by
privacy
in
this
statute.
not
everything
as
to
which
there
is
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
should
be
disclosable
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
the
fact
that
the
police
can
search
garbage
cans
under
this
court's
decision
in
california
v.
greenwood
i
hope
does
not
mean
that
everything
they
find
is
automatically
disclosable
to
the
public
without
more
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
i
think
the
citizenry
retains
some
information...
some
interest
in
preventing
widespread
and
indiscriminate
public
disclosure
of
things
even
though
the
police
may
be
entitled
to
lock
at
them.
mr.
baine
says
the
public
would
have
an
interest
in
this
information
if
it
shows
that
charles
medico
has
no
significant
record.
i
doubt
that
charles
medico
would
welcome
public
inquiry
into
his
past
criminal
record.
