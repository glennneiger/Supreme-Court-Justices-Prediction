justice
scalia
mr.
neal,
777...
and
that
was
sort
of
your
argument
that...
that
the
old
section
32
survives
until
it's
finally
picked
up
somehow
in
rule
15,
but
by
the
time
it
gets
picked
up
in
rule
15
with
the
48
revision,
it...
it
no
longer
is
the
broad
jurisdictional
provision
that
you...
that
you
referred
to.
it
has...
when
it...
when
it
becomes
revised
statute
section
954...
and
i
don't
know
when
that
came
about,
but
certainly
later
when
it's
section
777,
it
reads,
"no
summons,
writ,
declaration,
return,
process,
judgment,
or
other
proceedings
shall
be
abated,
arrested,
quashed
or
reversed
for
any
defect
or
want
of
form.
"
"it...
it
becomes...
and
it
goes
on
to
say.
"
such
court
shall
proceed
and
give
judgment,
"blah,
blah,
blah".
such
court
shall
amend
every
such
defect
and
want
of
form
other
than
those
which
the
party
demurring
so
expresses
and
may
at
any
time
permit
either
of
the
parties
to
amend
any
defect
in
the
process
or
pleadings
upon
such
conditions
as
it
shall
in
its
discretion
by
its
rules
prescribed.
"doesn't
all
that"--
justice
scalia
--just
go
to
defects
of
form
by...
by
then?
don't
you
think
the
last
clause
of
that,
of
777,
fairly
read
only
applies
to
defects
of
form?
in
other
words,
i
don't
read
777
as
being
really
the
same
as
32.
justice
scalia
to
come
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
it's
not
really
an
article
iii
problem
unless
you
think
that
article
iii
requires
complete
diversity.
we've
never
held
that,
have
we?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
congress
might
provide,
might
it
not,
as
far
as
our
opinions
show
that
even
if
there
was
not
complete
diversity,
so
long
as
you
had
some
diverse
parties
in
the
suit,
the
suit
could
proceed
in
federal
court?
and
if
that's
true,
then
what
was
involved
here
was
simply
a
failure
to
comply
with
the
statute
and
not
with
article
iii.
and
congress
could,
by
statute
provide
that,
well,
complete
diversity
is
the
ordinary
rule,
but
we
will
allow
a
suit
that
had
incomplete
diversity
to
be
valid
from
the
beginning
so
long
as
it
is
later
amended
to
create
complete
diversity.
that
would
comply
with
article
iii,
wouldn't
it?
justice
scalia
you
think
complete
diversity
is
required
by
article
iii?
justice
scalia
well,
i
think
there
is
diversity
when
some
people
on
both
sides
of
the
suit
are
from
different
states.
why
isn't
that
diversity?
justice
scalia
i'm
glad
you
think
it
is
so
clear.
i--
