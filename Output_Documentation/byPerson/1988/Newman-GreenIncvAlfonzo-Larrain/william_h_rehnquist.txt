we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
88-774,
newman-green,
inc.,
versus
alejandro
alfonzo-larrain.
mr.
neal.
chief
justice
rehnquist
amendments
of
the
sort
that
you
would
have
had
to
make,
mr.
neal?
judge
posner
took
the
position
when,
i
guess,
the
defective
allegations
of
jurisdiction
were...
where
the
allegations
didn't
conform
to
fact
and...
does
the
section
32
authorizer
broader
amendments
than
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
only
appellate
court
in
existence,
i
guess,
at
the
time
of
the
judiciary
of
1789
or
about
to
become
in
existence
would
be
our
court.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
could
appeal
from
the
district
court
to
the
circuit
courts?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
where
is
section
32
to
be
found
in
the
present?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
neal.
mr.
heap.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
heap,
supposing
that
it
had
come
to
the
court
of
appeals'
attention
that
this
fifth
defendant
was,
in
fact,
diverse,
so
that
you're
not
talking
about
an...
an
amendment
to
change
facts
or...
or
a
dismissal
of
a
defendant
who
couldn't
be
sustained
with
complete
diversity,
but
just
an...
an
erroneous
factual
allegation.
could
the
court
of
appeals
have
done
nothing
about
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
heap.
mr.
neal,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
neal.
the
case
is
submitted.
