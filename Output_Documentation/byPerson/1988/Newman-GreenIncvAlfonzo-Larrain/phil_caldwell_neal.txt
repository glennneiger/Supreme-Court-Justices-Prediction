mr.
phil
caldwell
neal
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
narrow
issue
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
a
court
of
appeals
may
permit
amendment
of
the
complaint
to
drop
a
nondiverse
defendant
and
thereby
perfect
diversity
jurisdiction
so
that
the
court
may
go
on
to
decide
the
merits
of
the
appeal.
the
court
below
held
that
it
had
no
such
power.
the
courts
of
appeals
for
the
second,
third,
fifth,
ninth
and
district
of
columbia
circuits
have
held
to
the
contrary
and,
in
fact,
no
court
since
1942,
which
was
the
seventh
circuit
again,
has
held
that
it
did
not
have
such
power.
it
is
a
narrow
issue,
but
perhaps
the
broader
significance
of
it
is
that
it
raises
a
question
whether
the
powers
of
the
courts
of
appeals,
so
far
as
possible,
should
be
conducted
in
a
way...
should
be
construed
in
a
way
that
permits
the
just,
speedy
and
inexpensive
termination
of
controversies
as
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
admonish.
the
case
arises
from
a
suit
brought
by
the
plaintiff,
petitioner
here,
the
newman-green
company,
to
enforce
certain
individual
guarantee
agreements
of
individuals
in
venezuela
which
guaranteed
royalty
payments
due
from
a
venezuelan
corporation
under
a
license
agreement
with
the
plaintiff
corporation.
the
plaintiff...
the
complaint
alleged
that
the
five
individual
defendants,
that
four
of
them
were
residents
and
citizens
of
venezuela,
and
that
the
fifth-named
defendant,
one
bettison,
was
a
citizen
of
the
united
states,
resident
in
caracas,
venezuela,
and
the
complaint
alleged
jurisdiction
based
on
section
1332
of
title
28.
the...
no
objection
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
of
the
district
court,
was
made
by
the
defendants
at
any
time,
although
they
did,
oddly
enough,
move
to
quash
service
of
process.
that
was
overruled.
the
case
was
litigated
in
the
district
court
for
about
four-and-a-half
years,
and
you
can
get
some
idea
of
the
extensiveness
of
the...
of
the
litigation
and
how
controverted
it
was
by
scanning
the
docket
entries
which
are
reproduced
in
the...
in
the
joint
appendix.
at
length
after
four-and-a-half
years,
during
which
time
the
district
court
had
rendered
several
opinions,
the
district
court
rendered
summary
judgment
which
disposed
of
all
of
the
claims
against
the
five
individual
defendants.
the
venezuelan
corporation
itself
had
intervened
in
the
meantime
and
had
certain
counterclaims
pending.
the
district
court
gave
judgment
in
part
for
the
plaintiff,
and
that
judgment
was
eventually
satisfied.
no
appeal
was
taken
from
it,
but
in
important
aspects
gave
judgment,
summary
judgment
for
the
defendants
and
entered
a
rule
54(b)
certification,
upon
which
appeal
was
taken
to
the
seventh
circuit.
when
counsel
for
the
appellant
rose
to
make
his
argument,
a
judge
of
the
seventh
circuit
said,
"do
we
have
jurisdiction
of
the
case?
"
and
it
was
then
and
only
at
that
time
that
anyone
realized
that
in
fact,
under
section
1332,
there
was
no
diversity
jurisdiction.
mr.
phil
caldwell
neal
that
was
judge
easterbrook,
justice
radmun...
blackmun.
mr.
phil
caldwell
neal
judge
easterbrook
wrote
the
dissent,
yes.
judge
easterbrook
raised
the
issue
and
then
suggested
to
counsel
that
the
problem
could
be
solved
if
the
plaintiffs
cared
to
file
a
motion
to
dismiss
bettison,
the
nondiverse
defendant.
the
argument
continued.
the
case
was
taken
under
submission.
the
plaintiff
did
indeed
file
such
a
motion.
the
defendants,
the
appellees,
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
case
rather
than
to
dismiss
the
defendant,
and
when
the
opinion
came
out,
judge
easterbrook
dealt
first
with
the
jurisdictional
point
and
then
said
we
grant
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
nondiverse
defendant
and
proceeded
to
decide
the
merits.
a
motion
for
rehearing
and
rehearing
en
banc
was
filed.
seventh
circuit
granted
rehearing
en
banc,
and
the
result
of
the
en
banc
hearing
was
that
the
majority
of
the
court,
in
an
opinion
by
judge
posner,
held
that
judge
easterbrook's
opinion
was
erroneous,
vacated
the...
vacated
the
decision
of
the
panel,
and
held
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
power
to
amend,
to
permit
the
dismissal
of
a
nondiverse
defendant,
that
that
could
be
done
only
in
the
district
court
and
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings
to
consider
whether
such
a
motion
should
be
granted.
and
indeed,
it
perhaps
bears
noting,
that
the
opinion
of
judge
posner
suggested
that
the
district
court
might
choose
to
exercise
its
discretion
by
saying
six
years
is
long
enough,
and
out
you
go,
rather
than
merely
addressing
whether
they...
whether
the
other
side
had
been
somehow
prejudiced
by
the
inclusion
of
bettison
as
a
defendant
during
that
period.
mr.
phil
caldwell
neal
to
remand?
mr.
phil
caldwell
neal
no,...
no
your
honor.
we
only
argue
that
the
court
had
power
which...
which
it
disclaimed
to
do
the
opposite
and
to
decide
the
case
then
and
there
by
permitting
the
dismissal.
mr.
phil
caldwell
neal
and...
and
indeed,
according
to
a
fairly
substantial
body
of
authority,
it
could
have
been
a
remand
that
directed
the
district
court
to
permit
a
dismissal
of
the
nondiverse
defendant
on
the
ground
that
any
contrary
action
would
be
an
abuse
of
the
district
court's
discretion.
the
result
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision,
of
course,
is
that
the
case
would,
at
a
minimum,
have
to
go
back
to
the
district,
where
at
best,
perhaps,
the
district
judge
would
do
what
judge
easterbrook
had
said
ought
to
be
done,
permit
the
dismissal
of
the
nondiverse
defendant,
and
then
reconsider
and
perhaps
enter
again
the
same
judgment
on
the
same
grounds
that
the
district
court
had
done
before,
and
then
a
new
appeal
would
be
started
and
a
year
later--
mr.
phil
caldwell
neal
--perhaps...
perhaps
it
could.
needless
to
say,
the...
the
majority
of
the
seventh
circuit
didn't
consider
any
such
thing
and
indeed,
one
of
the
necessary
consequences,
which
the
majority
of
the
court
saw,
was
that
the
decision
on
the
merits
had
to
be...
had
to
be
vacated,
and...
and...
and
the
whole
case
really
had
to
go
back
for
an
exercise
of
judgment
which
the
court
of
appeals
saw
it
could
not...
it
could
not
make.
mr.
phil
caldwell
neal
oh,
no,
your
honor.
we...
we
certainly
think
that
judge
easterbrook's
panel
did--
mr.
phil
caldwell
neal
--well,
we
presented...
yes,
we
presented
supporting
rationale,
i
think,
and
maybe
if
i...
if
i
go...
if
i
go
directly...
directly
to
that,
there
is
an...
there
is
an
issue
in
the
case
raised
by...
by
judge
posner's
opinion
and
relied
on
very
heavily
by...
by
the
respondents
here
that
the
whole
business
is
of
permitting
the
dismissal
of
a
nondiverse
defendant
is
offensive
to
fundamental
issues...
principles
of
federal
jurisdiction.
the
other
issue,
which
we
think
is
the
only
real
issue,
and
i
will
come
back
to
that
one,
was
whether
there
is
any
authority
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
permit
amendment
of
the...
of
the
complaint,
and
there
is
a
specific
statute,
section
1653
of
title
28,
which
says
defective
allegations
of
jurisdiction
may
be
amended
in
either
the
trial
or
the
appellate
court.
and...
and
the
majority
of
the
court
below
held
that
that
didn't
reach
this
case.
judge
easterbrook
disagreed
on
that.
what
we...
and
judge
posner's
opinion
said
there
isn't
any
other
source
of
authority.
courts
of
appeals
don't
permit
amendments.
i
suppose
what...
what
we
have
contributed,
if
anything,
to
the
solution
of
this
problem
is
that
if
you
go
back
to
section
32
of
the
judiciary
act
of
1789,
it
expressly
confers
authority
on
the
courts
of
appeals,
as
well
as
the
district
courts,
to
permit...
to
permit
amendment,
and...
and
that...
that
statute
has
been
relied
on
more
than
once
by
this
court
to
permit--
mr.
phil
caldwell
neal
--it's...
it's
very
general
and...
it's
very
general
in...
in
its
language,
mr.
chief
justice.
it's...
it's...
it's
not
directed
expressly
to
amendments
to
preserve
or
correct
jurisdictional
defect.
it's...
it's...
it's
a
general
provision
permitting
the
appellate
courts
to...
to
permit
amendments,
and
justice
story
way
back
in...
in
1812
wrote
an
opinion
that
circuit
reported
in...
in
1
gallison's
report
called
anonymous
decision,
in
which
he
said
there's
nothing
at
common
law
to
prevent
courts
of
appeal
as
well
as
trial
courts
from
permitting
amendments
of
the...
of
the
pleadings.
mr.
phil
caldwell
neal
well,
that
is
correct,
except
that
in
some...
in
some
aspects
the
old
circuit
courts
had
an
appellate
jurisdiction
from--
mr.
phil
caldwell
neal
--yes.
but
i...
but
i...
and
i...
and...
and...
and
justice
story's
opinion
was
rendered
on
circuit...
i
mean,
in
a
circuit
court
as
a
circuit
justice,
so...
so,
there
it
is.
there
is...
there's
authority
from
the
very
beginning
to
do...
to
do
exactly
what
the
court
below,
the
majority
of
the
court
below
said
there
wasn't
any--
mr.
phil
caldwell
neal
--it's
not,
your
honor.
it...
it...
it
continued
as
section
954
of
the
revised
statutes.
it
was
relied
on
as
late
as
1925.
i
think,
in
an
opinion
of
mr.
justice
sutherland
permitting
in
this
court
the
amendment
of
pleadings
to
show
the
raising
of
a
federal
question.
but
it
evaporated
with
the
revision
of
the
judicial
code
in...
in
1948,
and--
mr.
phil
caldwell
neal
--well,
777
was...
was
omitted
from...
from
the
judicial
code
of
1948,
and
the
revisors
said
that...
that
these
provisions
had
been
picked
up
in
the
federal
rules.
now--
mr.
phil
caldwell
neal
--that
is
a
part
of--
mr.
phil
caldwell
neal
--well,
i
think
there
were
changes.
i
think
there
were
changes
in
language,
your
honor,
and
i
will
not
be...
i
will
not
be
categorical
about
it.
but,
as
i
say,
section
954
was
relied
on
as
late
as...
as
1925
as
permitting
this
kind
of
amendment
there
having
to
do
with
federal
question
jurisdiction
rather
than
diversity
jurisdiction,
and
954,
i
think,
became
777
in
the
codification
of
1926
immediately
thereafter.
and
i'm...
and
i'm
not
aware
of
anything
that
suggests
that
there
was
a
purpose
at
that
point
to...
to...
to
narrow
the...
the
power.
in
any
event,
i
do
not...
it
seems
to
me
that
the
significance
of
this
background
is
simply
that
there
was
recognized
from
the
very
beginning
a
power...
power
to
permit
amending
the
complaint,
even
on
appeal,
in
order
to
avoid
unnecessary
further
proceedings
at
the
district
court
level.
this
court
relied
on...
on
that
in...
in
a
number
of
decisions
along
the
way;
kennedy
against
the
bank
of
georgia
in
1850.
and
even
without
reliance
on
that
statute,
i
believe
that
justice
marshall...
chief
justice
marshall's
decision
in
carneal
v.
banks
back
in
1825
is
an
express...
an
explicit
authorization.
it
doesn't
talk
about...
about
trial
or
appellate
courts.
it's
pretty
clear
if
that
opinion
is
read
carefully,
which
i
don't
think
anybody
else
involved
in
this
case
has
really
done,
that
that
opinion
is
exactly
what
judge
easterbrook
did
in
the...
in
the
court
below.
i
think
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
phil
caldwell
neal
i
think
i
would
only...
only
like
to
comment
on
what
seems
to
me
to
be
a
misconception,
not
only
in
mr.
heap's
argument,
but
also
in
judge
posner's
opinion.
and
that
is
that
what
is
involved
in
this
case
involves
somehow
changing
the
facts
as
they
existed
when
the
complaint
was
filed.
we
have...
we
do
not...
we
do
not
question
the
general
position
that
jurisdiction
in
a
federal
court
is
determined
by
the
facts
as
of
the
date
the
case
was
filed.
no
facts
are
being
changed
here.
it's
not
as
though
you
were
trying
to
show
that
mr.
bettison
had
become
a
citizen
of
a
state,
even
though
he
was
not
at
the
time
the
action
was
filed.
all
that's
being
changed
here
is
a...
is
a
pleading.
it
is
dropping
an
allegation
which
defeats
federal
jurisdiction,
and
section
1653,
on
its
face,
is
designed
to
permit
the
changing
of
pleadings,
not
the
changing
of
facts.
this
is
not
the
changing
of
facts.
i
think
the
other
thing
that
i
would...
and,
of
course,
to...
to
call
that
into
question
is
to
call
into
question
the
massive
body
of
precedent
that
goes
all
the
way
back
to
1825
and
has
been
continuous.
we've
set
forth
on...
on
i
think
two
or
three
pages
of
our
reply
brief
the
cases,
and
they're
only
part
of
the
cases.
and
even
though
judge
posner
in
his
opinion
toward
the
end
of
it,
seemed
to
express
some
discomfort
with
that
thought,
the
cases
are
there,
and
i
submit
that
you
really
can't
reconcile
those
cases
with
what's
really
the
fundamental
premise
of
judge
posner's
opinion.
mr.
phil
caldwell
neal
i've
been
baffled
by
the
same
thing,
your
honor.
[laughter]
and
it's
really
what
makes
me
think
that
the
kind
of
admonitory
purpose
of
judge
posner's
opinion,
which
seems
to
me
to
be
a
kind
of
dunce
cap
theory
of
jurisprudence.
go
back
to
the
district
court,
and
that's
wearing
the
dunce
cap,
and
everybody
will
see
and
be
wiser
from
there
on.
if
they
were
not
successful
in
imparting
this
wisdom
when
it
was
part
of
their
function
to
do
so,
i'm
a
little
skeptical
that
this
opinion
will
have
all
that...
all
that
effect.
and
i
suppose
the
only
thing
i...
i
should
throw
in
here
in
view
of
the
string
of
university
of
chicago
people
you've
mentioned
who
were
associated
with
this
is...
the
only
explanation
i
was
able
to
get
why
my
younger
and
brighter
colleagues
who
were
participants
in
this
error
was
one
of
them
said
yes,
he
took
federal
jurisdiction
at
the
university
of
chicago,
but
it
was
taught
that
year
by
a
visiting
professor
from
harvard,
and
they
didn't
deal
with
diversity
jurisdiction.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
will--
