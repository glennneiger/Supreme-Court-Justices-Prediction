justice
white
and
you
think
that...
i
take
it
from
your
brief,
you
think
that
both
judge
easterbrook
and
judge
posner
were...
were
not
on
the
right
track,
neither
one
of
them?
justice
white
but
i
thought
you
present
a
different
rationale
for
it.
justice
white
do
you
think
the
district
court
has
the
power
to
dismiss
a
nondiverse--
justice
white
--well,
do
you...
do
you
think
the...
do
you
think...
you
don't
think
judge
posner
was
right
that
the
district
court
could
have
done
this?
justice
white
well,
i
thought...
i
thought
most
of
the...
i
thought
the
two
opinions
said
all
that
could
possibly
be
said
about
the
case,
but--
justice
white
--but
mr.
neal
has
certainly
introduced
a
new
element.
justice
white
so
that
all
the
district
court
could
do
was
just
dismiss
the
case?
justice
white
and
you
say
it
shouldn't
have
been
remanded
for
that
purpose
at
all.
it
should
have
been
dismissed.
justice
white
so,
you
say
it
should
have
been
dismissed.
justice
white
yeah.
well...
but
the
en
banc
opinion
would
permit
the
district
court
to
consider
whether
just
to
drop
the
nondiverse
party.
justice
white
i'm
not
sure
you're
entitled
to
argue--
justice
white
--dismissal
theory
here
without
cross-appeal.
