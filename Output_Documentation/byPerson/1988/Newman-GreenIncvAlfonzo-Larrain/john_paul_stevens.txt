justice
stevens
mr.
heap,
is
there
is
a
difference
between
dropping
parties
to
create
federal
jurisdiction
and
adding
parties?
take
the
mullaney
case,
justice
frankfurter's
opinion.
how
do
you
distinguish
between
the
two?
justice
stevens
well,
it
didn't
have
jurisdiction
if
none
of
the
plaintiffs
had
standing.
justice
stevens
well,
because
they'd
added
two
parties
who
clearly
had
standing.
justice
stevens
well,
would
you
say
that
if
it
were
clear
that
there
had
been
no
jurisdiction
before
the
additional
parties
were
added,
that
the
court
could
not
have
allowed
that
to
take
place?
justice
stevens
i
see.
well,
under
the
en
banc
opinion,
you're
going
to
be
in
the
district
court.
it's
remanded
for
further
proceedings
in
this
case.
justice
stevens
mr.
neal,
there's
one
thing
about
this
case
that
puzzles
me
that
i
notice
professor
easterbrook
and
professor
posner
and
yourself
and
your
opponent,
judge
shader,
all
have
a
connection
with
the
university
of
chicago
law
school.
i
just
wonder
why
that
faculty
can't
straighten
the
matter
out
like
this
a
little
more
consistently.
[laughter]
