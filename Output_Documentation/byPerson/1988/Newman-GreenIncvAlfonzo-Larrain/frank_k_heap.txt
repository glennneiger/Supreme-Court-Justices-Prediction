mr.
frank
k.
heap
mr.
chief
judge,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
is
a
serious
of
inescapable
facts
in
this
case,
and
those
facts
very
simply
are
that
at
the
time
this
complaint
was
filed,
there
was
no
federal
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
at
the
time
the
case
was
tried
in
the
district
court,
there
was
no
federal
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
at
the
time
the
panel
heard
the
case,
there
was
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
at
the
time
the
full
en
banc
court
heard
the
case,
there
was
no
federal
jurisdiction,
and
there
is
no
federal
jurisdiction
as
i
stand
here
today.
mr.
bettison
is
an
offending
party.
the
question
is
what
does
one
do
about
it.
there
was
great
discussion
by
both
the
dissenting
opinion
and
the
en
banc
opinion
on
the
applications
of
rules
15
and
rules
21.
there
was
no
discussion
of
rule
1.
rule
1
very
clearly
says,
"these
rules
govern
the
procedure
in
the
united
states
district
courts.
"
--does
not
govern
the
procedures
in
the
circuit
court.
whether
the
circuit
court
wishes
to
adopt
those
rules,
it
may,
but
it
hasn't
in
the
seventh.
more
importantly,
all
of
the
opinions
have
ignored
rule
12(h)(3),
and
that
rule
very
clearly
say
whenever
it
appears
by
suggestion
of
the
parties
or
otherwise
that
the
court
lacks
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter,
the
court
shall
dismiss
the
action.
mr.
frank
k.
heap
i
believe
that
rules
15...
1653
very
clearly
covers
that
situation,
and
that
may
be
done
in
either
the
trial
court
or
the
appellate
court
if
it
is
a
defective
matter
of
pleading;
i.e.,
in
your
particular
case,
chief
judge...
justice,
the
case
where
you
had
mispleaded,
where
you
had
diversity.
the
problem
with
1653,
however,
is
that
you
cannot
drop
people
in
order
to
create
that
jurisdiction.
there's
a
long
list
and
long
series
of
cases
on
that
very
subject.
mr.
frank
k.
heap
i
do
not,
your
honor.
i...
i
believe
this
matter
should...
should
have
been
direct
back
to
the
district
court
for
a
ruling
under
rule
12.
mr.
frank
k.
heap
judge
posner's
opinion
is...
is
very
brief.
it
covers
the
first
two
paragraphs.
from
that
point
on,
judge
posner
seems
to
get
into
a
long
dissertation--
mr.
frank
k.
heap
--i
would
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
k.
heap
well,
i
don't
think
that
there
has
been
one
case,
in
deference
to
mr.
neal's
position,
that
has
taken
the
position
that
federal
subject
matter
jurisdiction
can
be
created
in
a
manner
that
it
was
attempted.
mr.
frank
k.
heap
that
is
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
k.
heap
i
don't
believe
that
parties
have
the
right
to
stipulate
to
federal
jurisdiction,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
k.
heap
in
the
mullaney
case,
your...
justice,
the...
the
federal
court
had
jurisdiction.
it
was
a
federal
question
that
was
involved.
it
had
federal
jurisdiction.
the
problem
involved
the...
whether
or
not
the
principal
of
an
undisclosed...
or
of
a
disclosed
or
the
issue--
mr.
frank
k.
heap
--the
plaintiff
ultimately...
actually,
by
the
time
the
case
was
decided
had
standing
under
the
federal--
mr.
frank
k.
heap
--that
is
correct.
but
the
controversy
that
existed
between
the
parties
was
between
diverse
citizens.
it
was...
it
was
a
suit
that
was
originally
styled
in
the
name
of
the
case.
mr.
frank
k.
heap
that
would
be
our
position,
yes.
mr.
frank
k.
heap
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
k.
heap
no,
no.
my...
my
argument
was
that
it
should
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
with
directions
that
a
ruling
under
rule
12
be
entered.
there
was
no
federal
jurisdiction,
and
the
case
should
have
been
dismissed.
mr.
frank
k.
heap
that
is
correct,
by
the
district
court.
mr.
frank
k.
heap
i
think
if
you
read
judge--
mr.
frank
k.
heap
--your
honor--
mr.
frank
k.
heap
--well,
i
think...
i
think,
your
honor,
that
very
recent
cases
including
the
tahoe...
lake
tahoe
case
very
clearly
indicate
that
subject
matter
jurisdiction
can
be
raised
without
a
cross-appeal.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
judge
posner,
if
you
read
his
opinion,
was
constrained
because
of
a
rather
lengthy
series
of
discussions,
as
mr.
neal
has
pointed
out,
and
a
conflict
between
the
various
circuit
courts
from
taking
an
action
other
than
follow
either
rule
21
or
rule
15.
i
think
the
time
and
the
reason
this
case
has
importance,
i
believe,
today
is
that
this
court
ought
to
give
direction
to
the
circuit
courts
as
to
what
you
do
when
you
clearly
have
no
federal
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
this
is
an
extension--
mr.
frank
k.
heap
--i
believe
so.
there's
no
basis
other
than
diversity.
diversity
is
the
only
basis
upon
which
this
case
is
brought.
this
is...
is
basically
a
state
jurisdiction.
mr.
frank
k.
heap
the
plaintiff
chose
to
bring
and
style
his
suit
in
the
federal
district
court
and
alleged
jurisdiction
which
didn't
exist.
mr.
frank
k.
heap
i
don't
think
we're
arguing
their
control
should...
should
terminate.
if,
in
fact,
there
is
federal
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
the
case
proceeds.
if
there
is
not,
i
think
the
case
must
be
dismissed.
mr.
frank
k.
heap
there
are
cases
that
have
applied,
and
particularly
on
the
west
coast,
have
applied
rule
15
to
allow
this
relation
back.
there
are
an
equal
number
of
cases
in
the
circuit
that
the
test
of
federal
jurisdiction
is
determined
at
the
time
the
case
is
filed
and
subsequent
events
don't
change
that
fact.
it's
a
very
difficult
situation.
it
has
never
reached
this
court
before.
the
court
has
come
very
close
in
a
couple
of
cases
to
address
this
question,
but
it's...
my
research
has
revealed
this
is
the
first
time
the
issue
has
been
directly
before
this
court.
mr.
frank
k.
heap
i
think--
mr.
frank
k.
heap
--i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
frank
k.
heap
i
think
that
the
federal
court
is
a
court
of
very
limited
jurisdiction.
that
jurisdiction
is
set
forth
from
the
sovereign...
it
happens
to
be
the
people
of
the
united
states,
as
embodied
in
the
constitution,
and
i
don't
believe
the
congress
has
the
authority
to
expand
that.
it
requires
diversity
of
citizenship.
diversity
is
what's
required.
mr.
frank
k.
heap
it
requires
diversity
in
suits
by
citizens
of
one
state
against
residents
or
citizens
of
another.
mr.
bettison
is
a
stateless
citizen.
you
cannot
obtain
diversity
citizenship
over
mr.
bettison
pursuant
to
the
united
states
constitution.
it
is
not--
mr.
frank
k.
heap
--i
am
trying
to
find
a
simple
solution
to
what
has
now
been
30
years
of
confusion
in
the
circuit
courts.
if
there
are
no
further
questions...
thank
you,
your--
