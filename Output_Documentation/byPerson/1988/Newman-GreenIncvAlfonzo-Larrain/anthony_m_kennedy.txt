justice
kennedy
i
take
it
you
don't
argue
that
the
circuit
didn't
have
the
power
to
do
that
if
it
had
chosen
to
do
it.
justice
kennedy
yes.
justice
kennedy
but
really
a
remand
of
the
district
court
could
have
been
a
limited
remand
for
the
requesting
the
court
to
act
within
14
or
21
days,
could
it
not?
justice
kennedy
well,
it
wouldn't
necessarily
be
a
new
appeal.
the
circuit
court
could
retain
jurisdiction
after...
and
remand
for
the
limited
purposes
of
determining
this
motion
within
21
days,
and
the
argument's
been
made
before
the
panel,
and
the
case
is
then
correctly
before
it.
justice
kennedy
doesn't...
doesn't
part
of
it
survive
in
28
u.s.c.
777?
justice
kennedy
mr.
heap--
--suppose
both
parties
had
stipulated
that
the
non...
that
the
nondiverse
party
could
be
dismissed.
justice
kennedy
what
about
rule
15(c),
the
relation-back
rule?
do
the
cases
hold
that
the
relation-back
rule,
the
cases
in
the
circuit
courts
hold
that
the
relation-back
rule
doesn't
apply
if
there's
a
jurisdictional
defect?
