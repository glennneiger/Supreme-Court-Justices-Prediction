justice
o'connor
well,
it's
not
an
article
iii
jurisdictional
problem,
in
any
event,
is
it,
do
you
think?
justice
o'connor
why
shouldn't
a
party
plaintiff
have
some
control
over
the
plaintiff's
own
case
after
it's
filed,
to
the
extent
of
being
able
to
seek
dismissal
in
these
circumstances?
justice
o'connor
i
don't
see
why
the
plaintiff's
control
should
automatically
terminate
with
the
filing
of
a
complaint.
