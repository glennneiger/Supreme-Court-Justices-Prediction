ms.
laurie
webb
daniel
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
eleventh
circuit.
the
principal
issue
to
be
decided
by
this
court
is
whether
the
osternecks'
request
for
prejudgment
interest,
which
was
made
immediately
after
a
trial
of
the
osternecks'
claims,
is
a
motion
falling
under
rule
59(e)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
this
question
is
crucial
to
this
case
because
if
the
osternecks'
request
for
prejudgment
interest
is
considered
a
rule
59(e)
motion,
then
under
rule
4(a)(4)
of
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure,
the
motion
would
have
the
effect
of
suspending
the
finality
of
the
judgment
and
of
nullifying
the
osternecks'
notice
of
appeal
which
was
filed
within
30
days
of
the
judgment.
the
eleventh
circuit
found
that
the
osternecks'
request
for
prejudgment
interest
is
a
rule
59(e)
motion
which
prevented
it
from
having
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
osternecks'
appeal
from
the
judgment
entered
in
favor
of
ernst
&
whinney.
the
osternecks
are
asking
this
court
to
reverse
and
demand
for
three
basic
reasons.
first,
the
osternecks'
request
simply
does
not
fit
the
definition
of
a
rule
59(e)
motion
as
explained
by
the
legislative
history
and
the
decisions
of
this
court.
second,
the
osternecks'
request
cannot
be
distinguished
from
a
request
for
attorney's
fees,
which
this
court
has
found
does
not
fall
within
the
scope
of
rule
59(e).
third,
to
hold
in
the
osternecks'
favor
would
be
consistent
with
traditional
principles
of
finality
and
appellate
procedure.
there
are
few
background
facts
which
may
be
helpful
to
this
court
in
deciding
this
issue.
the
background
facts
are
brief
and,
and
undisputed.
this
case
was
litigated
for
almost
10
years
before
a
jury
trial
was
finally
reached.
the
jury
trial
lasted
three-and-a-half
months.
every
issue
was
completely
litigated
during
that
time.
after
three-and-a-half
months
of
trial,
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
on
all
of
the
osternecks'
claims.
the
jury
found
that
certain
of
the
defendants
were
liable
for
damages.
however,
the
jury
found
that
ernst
&
whinney
was
not
liable.
immediately
after
the
jury
determined
the
liability
and
damages
on
the
osternecks'
claims,
the
osternecks'
asked
the
trial
judge
to
add
prejudgment
interest
to
the
amount
awarded
by
the
jury.
the
trial
judge
at
that
point
determined
that
the
prejudgment
interest
issue
should
be
handled
separately,
and
the
trial
judge
instructed
the
osternecks
to
submit
briefs
on
this
issue.
at
the
same
time,
the
trial
judge
instructed
the
clerk
of
the
court
to
enter
final
judgment
pursuant
to
the
jury
verdict
determining
liability
and
damages
on
all
of
the
osternecks'
claims.
ms.
laurie
webb
daniel
that's
correct.
ernst
&
whinney...
as
far
as
ernst
&
whinney
was
concerned,
the
case
was
over.
they
had
won
the
case
at
trial.
the
osternecks'
request
for
prejudgment
interest
didn't
affect
anything
that
the
jury
decided
with
regard
to
any
of
the
defendants
as
a
matter
of
fact.
the
request,
in
fact,
accepted
the
jury's
determination
of
liability
and
damages.
the
request
was
based
on
the
jury's
determination
of
liability
and
damages.
in
fact,
in
the...
in
the
written
motion
and
in
the
briefs,
the
osternecks
told
the
trial
court
this
is
what
the
jury
found
and
we
want
prejudgment
interest
based
on
that
to
be
calculated.
ms.
laurie
webb
daniel
it's...
under
the...
this
was
a
federal
securities
law
case.
so,
it's
under
the
rule
that...
in
a
10(b)(5)
case
where...
that
prejudgment
interest
is
not
a
matter
of
right;
it
is
a
discretionary
matter
for
the
trial
judge
to
decide.
ms.
laurie
webb
daniel
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
laurie
webb
daniel
that's
correct,
your
honor.
originally
when
this
case
was
filed
in
1975,
i
believe
that
ernst
&
ernst
was
the
named
defendant.
subsequently
it
became
ernst
&
whinney.
all
parties
considered
the
judgment
entered
on
the
jury
verdict
to
be
a
final
judgment
and
an
appealable
judgment.
all
parties,
in
fact,
did
file
notices
of
appeal
from
that
judgment.
when
the
prejudgment
interest
was
added
several
months
later,
the
trial
court
was
careful
in
his
order
to
make
it
clear
that
he
was
not
changing
any
of
the
decisions
embodied
in
the
judgment
that
was
entered
on
the
jury
verdict.
he
specified
that
other
than
the
addition
of
the
prejudgment
interest,
the
judgment
entered
on
the
jury
verdict
was
to
remain
the
same
in
all
respects.
ms.
laurie
webb
daniel
the
punitive
damage
question...
i
don't
think
that
the
trial
judge
would
be
able
to
award
punitive
damages.
that's
something
that
the
jury--
ms.
laurie
webb
daniel
--if
the
trial
judge
added
punitive
damages--
ms.
laurie
webb
daniel
--on
his,
on
his...
on
request?
ms.
laurie
webb
daniel
if
the,
if
the
osternecks
had
asked
the
trial
judge
after
judgment
to
award
punitive
damages.
ms.
laurie
webb
daniel
well,
that
would
not
affect
the
finality
of
the,
the
judgment
that
was
entered
on
the
jury
verdict.
if
it
was
an
incorrect
award
of
punitive
damages,
then
the
defendants
would
be
able
to
appeal.
ms.
laurie
webb
daniel
not
of
the
decisions
embodied
in
the,
the
judgment
entered
on
the
jury
verdict.
those...
that
decision
and
determination
of
liability
and
damages
would
remain
intact.
ms.
laurie
webb
daniel
well,
if...
i
believe
that
if
that
were,
in
fact,
possible
that...
that
under
traditional
principles
of
finality
and
appealability
would
not
affect
the
finality
of
the
judgment.
what--
ms.
laurie
webb
daniel
--well,
it's
possible.
as
a
practical
matter,
however,
in
this
sort
of
situation
where
you've
had
a
trial
and,
and
you
have
a
jury
verdict
and
a
case
has
been
litigated
to
this
extent,
the
substantive
issues
and
the
merits
issues
really
have,
have
been
exhausted.
this
court
in
a
fairly
recent
decision
in
stringfellow
v.
concerned
neighbors...
i
believe
that
was
decided
in
1977...
elaborated
on
the
purpose
of--
ms.
laurie
webb
daniel
--nineteen
eighty-seven
i
believe
it
was.
yes.
elaborated
on
the
purposes
of
the
finality
rule
of
section
1291.
and
the
court
said
in
that
case:
"as
we
have
noted
in
the
past,
the
finality
rule
of
section
1291
protects
a
variety
of
interests
that
contribute
to
the
efficiency
of
the
legal
system.
"
"pretrial
appeals
may
cause
disruption,
delay
and
expense
for
the
litigants.
"
"they
also
burden
appellate
courts
by
requiring
immediate
consideration
of
issues
that
may
become
moot
or
irrelevant
by
the
end
of
trial.
"
"in
addition,
the
finality
doctrine
protects
the
strong
interests
in
allowing
trial
judges
to
supervise
pretrial
and
trial
procedures
without
undue
interference.
"
i
think
that
the...
this
summary
shows
the
primary
concern
with
piecemeal
appeals
is
directed
at
appeals
that,
that
would
disrupt
the
trial
process
or
the
pretrial
process.
but
as
a
practical
matter,
where
you've
had
a
trial
on
all
claims
and
you
have
a
determination
of
liability
and
damages
on
all
claims
as
to
all
parties,
that
the
risk
of
piecemeal
appeals,
as
a
practical
matter,
is
not
great.
ms.
laurie
webb
daniel
no,
your
honor.
basically
the
question
of
prejudgment
interest
is...
prejudgment
interest
is
meant
to
compensate
the
plaintiff
for
the
loss
of
use
of
his
money
between
the
time
of
the
wrongdoing
until
the
time
of
the
judgment.
ms.
laurie
webb
daniel
well,
your
honor,
that...
that
is
what
the
eleventh
circuit
found.
however,
i
believe
that
the
ninth
circuit
aptly
pointed
out
it's
not
really
the
underlying
wrongdoing,
it's
the
delay
in
really
the
litigation
process
itself.
and
in
fact,
in
this
case
that
is
what
the
trial
judge
did
look
to
in
assessing
whether
prejudgment
interest
should
be
allowed.
ms.
laurie
webb
daniel
well,
of
course,
if
there
had
never
been
any
wrongdoing,
you
wouldn't
have
any
request
for
prejudgment
interest.
but
in
the
blau
v.
lehman
case,
which
is
the
case
where
this
court
made
it
clear
that
interest
is
not
entitled
as
a
matter
of
right
in
a
securities
fraud
claim,
this
court
described
interest
as
follows.
it
says:
"this
court
has
said
in
a
kindred
situation
that
interest
is
not
recovered
according
to
a
rigid
theory
of
compensation
from
money
withheld,
but
is
given
in
response
to
considerations
of
fairness.
"
it's
not
strictly
for...
it's
not
really
compensation
of
the
underlying
injury.
like
attorney's
fees,
it
does
compensate.
attorney's
fees
compensate
also.
they're
necessary
to
make
the
prevailing
party
whole.
ms.
laurie
webb
daniel
well,
as
the
trial
judge
in
this
court
took
into
consideration,
whether
there
was
some
responsibility
for
the
delay
on...
you
know,
doing...
due
as
a
result
of
the
plaintiff's
actions
or
other
circumstances,
such
as
in
this
case
where
we
had
i
think
five
or
six
district
court
judges
and
the
turnover
in,
in
judicial
personnel
during
the
course
of
litigation
contributed
to
the
delay
of
this
litigation.
these
are
factors
that
are
collateral
matters.
they're
not
related
to
the
wrongdoing
itself,
but
they
are
factors
that
the
judge
could
consider
in
his,
his...
under
his
equitable
powers.
in
fact,
the
prejudgment
interest
question,
like
attorney's
fees,
is,
is
uniquely
separable
from
the
underlying
cause
of
action.
here
the
jury
did
not
have
the
power
to
determine
prejudgment
interest.
it
could
not
even
be
decided
at
the...
determined
at
the
same
time
as
the
jury
decided
the
merits
of
the
underlying
cause
of
action.
of
necessity,
it
has
to
be
decided
in
a
separate
proceeding
by
the
trial
judge.
a
separate
decision
had
to
be
made
as
far
as
that.
the
merits
decision...
the...
what
the
case
was
all
about
had
already
been
determined
by
the
jury,
and
all
issues
had
been,
been
determined
on
the
merits.
there
was
liability
and
damages
determined
as
to
all
parties.
the
case
was,
was
essentially
over,
and
of
necessity,
we
had
to
have
a
decision
on
the
merits
before
we
could
even
ask
for
prejudgment
interest.
prejudgment
interest
is
like
attorney's--
ms.
laurie
webb
daniel
--your
honor,
that
is
related
to
the
merits.
however,
the
trial
judge
does
not
actually
reconsider...
make
a
separate
determination
of
that.
ms.
laurie
webb
daniel
that's
right.
and
in
that
respect
it
really
is
no
different
from
a
trial
judge
determining
whether
to
award
attorney's
fees
in
a
civil
rights
case.
i
believe
under
the
johnson
test,
the
trial
judge
has
to
look
to,
or
can
look
to,
such
things
as
the
underlying
wrongdoing,
the
nature
of
the
wrongdoing,
how
egregious
it
was,
how
unpopular
the
case
might
have
been,
how
difficult
it
might
have
been
to
obtain
counsel
in
that
type
of
case,
whether
the
party
actually
prevailed
on
the
civil
rights
cause
of
action
as
opposed
to
a
different
cause
of
action
that
might
be
alleged
in
the...
in
the
complaint.
all
of
these
things
would
involve
a
consideration
of
the
merits
of
that
action.
ms.
laurie
webb
daniel
well,
i
think
in
the
budinich
case,
certainly
you
did
make
that
acknowledgement.
but
the
reason
why
you,
you
made
that
decision,
as
far
as
all
attorneys'
fees
goes,
is
to
look
at,
at
the
reason
why
attorney's
fees
and
costs
should
be
treated
as
a
separable
issue.
and
this
goes
back
i
think...
what
we
need
to
keep
in
mind
when
we're
talking
about
whether
the
osternecks'
motion
was
a
rule
59(e)
motion,
that
is
the
definition
of
what
a
rule
59(e)
motion
is.
in
the
white
v.
new
hampshire
case,
this
court
explained
rule
59(e)
was
adopted
to
allow
a
trial
court
to
correct
an
error
in
a
decision
embodied
in
the
judgment,
but
it
was
not
meant
to
apply
to
motions
which
did
not
challenge
any
of
the
decisions
embodied
in
the
judgment.
it
does
not
apply
to
a
motion
which
merely
seeks
what
is
due
because
of
the
judgment.
and
the
costs
and
attorney's
fees
fit
that,
that
category
of
cases
that
don't
fall
within
the
scope
of
rule
59(e)
because
they
don't
challenge
any
of
the
decisions
embodied
in
the
judgment.
they
merely
seek
what
is
due
because
of
the
judgment.
ms.
laurie
webb
daniel
well,
your
honor,
if,
if
we
don't...
if
we
don't
prevail
at
all,
yes,
that's
correct.
ms.
laurie
webb
daniel
you
honor,
after
the
eleventh
circuit
dismissed
appeal,
the
trial
judge
at
that
point
determined
that
the
osternecks
would
not
have
additional
time
to
file
another
notice
of
appeal.
ms.
laurie
webb
daniel
the
trial
judge
did
rule
on
that,
on
the
osternecks'
request
for
additional
time
to
file
another
notice
of
appeal,
and
denied
the
osternecks'
request.
so,
the
osternecks
would
not
have
the
opportunity
in
the
trial
court
to
file
a
new
notice
of
appeal.
ms.
laurie
webb
daniel
that's
right,
your
honor.
there
are
unique
circumstances
in
this
case.
the
trial
judge
characterized
the
prejudgment
interest
request
as
a
separate
issue.
he
did
direct
the
clerk
to
enter
final
judgment
on
the
jury
verdict
at
the
same
time.
he
ordered
the
clerk
to
do
that
as
soon
as
possible.
all
parties
considered
the
final
judgment...
or
the
judgment
on
the
jury
verdict
to
be
final
for
purposes
of
appeal.
there
were
parties
who
stipulated
that
the
osternecks'
notice
of
appeal
was
timely
filed,
ernst
&
whinney--
ms.
laurie
webb
daniel
--there
is
a
very,
very
narrow
doctrine
that
was
announced
in
the
thompson
case
that
will
allow
a
circuit
court
of
appeals...
in
fact,
commands
them...
to
take
jurisdiction
over
a
case
where
a
party
has
filed
its
notice
of
appeal
in
reliance
of
action...
on
actions
of
the
district
court
and
other
parties
and
other
unique
circumstances.
we
believe
that
the
facts
surrounding
this
case
does
put
this
case
within
that
very,
very
narrow
exception.
there's
an
additional
fact
that
i
didn't
mention,
and
that
is
that
a
second
notice
of
appeal
was,
in
fact,
filed
in
this
case
on
the
prejudgment
interest
award.
ms.
laurie
webb
daniel
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and--
ms.
laurie
webb
daniel
--well,
in
the
thompson
case,
the
judge
had
characterized
the...
a
post-judgment
motion
as
being
timely
which
then
affected
the
time
when
the
parties
determined
when
to
file
their
notices
of
appeal.
the--
ms.
laurie
webb
daniel
--that
was
the
characterization
made
by
the
trial
court.
in
fact,
the
motion
was
tardy.
ms.
laurie
webb
daniel
excuse
me?
ms.
laurie
webb
daniel
well,
the
court
did
note
that
the--
ms.
laurie
webb
daniel
--not
directly
on
this
issue.
the
other
cases
cited
by
ernst
&
whinney
are
distinguishable,
and
most
of
them
involve
situations
where
prejudgment
interest
was
included
in
the
judgment
and
the
party
in
their
post-judgment
motion
was
seeking
to
delete
or
change
the
rate
of
interest
which
was
included
in
the
judgment.
in
that
situation
you
would
have
exactly
what
rule
59(e)
was
meant
to
apply
to.
you
would
have
a
motion
seeking
to
change
something
that
was
embodied
in
the
judgment.
the
osternecks'
motion
does
not
fall
in
that
type
of
category
since
it
did
not
challenge
the
underlying
judgment
in
any
way.
ms.
laurie
webb
daniel
that,
that
would
be
something
to
consider.
however,
the
trial
judge
also
characterized
the,
the
earlier
judgment
as
the
final
judgment
even
in
awarding
the
prejudgment
interest
and
there
are
these
additional
facts.
none
of
the
parties
ever
questioned
it.
the
trial
judge
didn't
ever
question
it.
i
think
that
there
is
an
additional
unique
circumstance
in
this
case
and
that
is
that
the
osternecks
did
file
a
second
notice
of
appeal
from
the
prejudgment
interest
award.
and
it
was
captioned
as
against
the
defendants
who
were
liable
for
damages.
however,
it
summed
up
saying
that
the
osternecks
were
appealing
from
all
prior
judgments.
the
eleventh
circuit
found
that
it
was
not
sufficient
to
preserve
an
appeal
against
ernst
&
whinney.
however,
ernst
&
whinney
knew
that
the
osternecks
were
appealing
against
them.
we
had
had
discussions
about
designating
the
record
continuously
during
all
this
time,
and
the
second
notice
of
appeal
did,
did
say
that
it
was
appealing
from
all
prior
judgments.
and
that--
ms.
laurie
webb
daniel
--it
did
not
denominate
ernst
&
whinney
by
name.
however,
ernst
&
whinney
did
know
there
was
another
notice
of
appeal
outstanding
which
it
had
also
considered
to
be
final,
a
final...
a
valid
appeal
from
a
final
judgment.
so,
ernst
&
whinney
knew
it
was
being...
facing
an
appeal.
there
was
a
second
notice
of
appeal
which
referred
to
the...
all
prior
judgments,
and
ernst
&
whinney
wouldn't
have
been
prejudiced
if
the
second
notice
of
appeal
could
be
deemed
to
preserve
a...
an
appeal
against
it.
i,
i
think
that
the
important
thing
in
this
case
is
to
keep
in
mind
the
definition
of
a
rule
59(e)
motion.
the
congress
intended
a
rule
59(e)
motion
to
cover
only
those
motions
seeking
to
correct
an
error
in
the
judgment
or
to
change
a
decision
embodied
in
the
judgment
and
not
to
apply
to
what...
something
that
seeks
some
thing
new.
ms.
laurie
webb
daniel
the
rule
itself
does
not
but
this
court
has
looked
to
the
legislative
history
in
the
white
decision
and
explained
that
that
is
what
it
is,
is
meant
to
deal
with.
and
as
a...
as
a
practical
matter,
the
budinich
case
reiterated
a
well-established
principle
that
where
you
have
a
litigation
that
has
effectively
terminated
on
the
merits,
the
reservation
of
an
issue
that
will
not
moot
or
alter
any
decisions
in
that
judgment
will
not
suspend
the
finality.
as
a
practical
matter,
that's
what
we
had
here.
this
case
had
gone
on
for
over
10
years,
we
had
had
a
jury
trial.
the
jury
had
returned
a
verdict
on
the
merits.
the
judgment
embodied
that.
the
osternecks'
request
for
prejudgment
interest
could
not
change
any
of
those
decisions.
ms.
laurie
webb
daniel
that...
that
would
not
be
covered
by
either
the
traditional
principle
i
just
mentioned
or
rule
59(e)
because
in
that
event,
the
litigation
would
not
have
been
over.
one
of
the
main
claims
would
have
been
left
unresolved.
and
we
don't...
in
our
situation
there
was
nothing
left
for
the
finder
of
fact
to
do.
the
trier
of
fact
could
not
determine
the
prejudgment
interest.
ms.
laurie
webb
daniel
that
would
not
be
a
rule
59(e)
motion
because
the...
there
would
be
no
final
judgment.
the
litigation
would
not
be
over.
there
would
be
an
underlying
claim
that,
that
would
not
have
been
resolved.
in
our
case
be
had
a,
a
verdict
on
all
claims
on...
as
to
all
to
all
parties.
the
litigation
was
over
in
that
respect.
it's,
it's
not...
it's
not
something
that,
that
the
trier
of
fact
could
determine
at
the
same
time.
it
was
something
that,
that
had
to
be
determined
separately.
i'd
like
to
reserve
any
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
laurie
webb
daniel
thank
you,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
i'd
like
to
point
out
we
are
not
seeking
this
court
to
reverse
under
the
doctrine...
the
collateral
order
doctrine
espoused
by
the
cohen
case.
that
deals
with
pretrial
collateral
issues.
we're
in
this
case
dealing
with
a
post-trial
motion
when
all
other
issues
had
been
decided.
and
as
a
practical
matter,
the
concern
for
piecemeal
appeals
is
not
great
where
you
have...
you
have
resolved
the
main
issues.
we're
not
advocating
separate
appeals.
in
this
situation
where
you've
had
a
trial,
all
the
other
issues
have
been
decided,
a
post-judgment
motion
like
this
could
easily
be
consolidated
with
the
prior
appeal
as
it
was
done
in
this
case.
the
eleventh
circuit
heard
oral
argument
on
the
merits
of
the
osternecks'
appeal
against
ernst
&
whinney
along
with
the
prejudgment
interest
questions.
it
was
consolidated.
where
you
have
had
a
trial,
that
is
often
the
case.
ms.
laurie
webb
daniel
your
honor,
i
would
respectfully
disagree
that
when
you
do
have
a
trial
and
have
had
the
litigation
and
a
judgment
entered
on
the
merits
of
the
case,
that
that
is
not
a
practical
concern.
as
this
court
found
in
the
budinich
case
with
the
attorney's
fees
issue
where
you,
you
resolved
the
case
on
the
merits,
the
threat
of
piecemeal
appeals
is,
is
not
as
a
practical
matter
great.
i
think
that
the
blau
case
and
then
the
old
case
of
stewart
v.
barnes
that
we
cited
in
our
brief
show
that
prejudgment
interest
is
a
collateral
issue.
it's
not...
it
does
not
form
the
substance
or
the
basis
of
the
cause
of
action,
but
is
awarded
only
in
respect...
with
respect
to
the
detention
of
the
principal
amount
and
is...
is
to
compensate
for
the
delay.
the
trial
judge
in,
in
our
case
did
only
look
to
the
delay
in
the
litigation
process
itself.
he
did
not
conduct
any
kind
of
lengthy
hearing
on
the
merits
of
the
case,
in
fact,
did
not
focus
on
the
merits
of
the
case
at
all.
with
regard
to
the
54(b)
issue,
this
case
does
not
fall
within
the
classic
54(b)
situation
because
it
was
over.
it
was
not
a
pretrial
situation.
prejudgment
interest
is
not
a
claim.
it's
what
is
due
because
of,
of
prevailing
on
a
claim.
however,
if
it
was
considered
a
54(b)
situation,
the
trial
judge
did
specifically
state
on
the
record
that--
ms.
laurie
webb
daniel
--thank
you.
