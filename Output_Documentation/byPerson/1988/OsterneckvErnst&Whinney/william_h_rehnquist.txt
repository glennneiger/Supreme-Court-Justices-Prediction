chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
87-1201,
myles
osterneck
v.
ernst
&
whinney.
wait
just
a
moment
unitl
the
court
clears
a
little
bit.
very
well.
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready,
ms.
daniel.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
jury
had
exonerated
ernst
&
whinney.
is
that
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
now
the
eleventh
circuit
said
that
under
georgia
law,
prejudgment
interest
is
discretionary
with
the
trial
judge?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
it
going
to
be
quite
difficult
for,
say,
the,
the
court
of
appeals
to
decide
in
a
separate
appeal
from
an
award
of
prejudgment
interest...
to
decide
that
question
without
getting
back
to
the
merits
of,
of
the
litigation
which
was
concluded
in
the
judgment
of
the
jury?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
does...
what
does
the
trial
judge
take
into
consideration
then
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
award
prejudgment
interest
in
a
securities
act
case
like
this?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
it
denominate
ernst
&
whinney
by
name?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
actually
59(e)
is
just
very
bare
of
any
meaning
in,
in
the
way
it's
set
out.
it
doesn't
really
say
what
it's
for,
does
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
justice
scalla's
motion
that
he
just
described
on
behalf
of
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case...
would
that
be
a
rule
59(e)
motion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
daniel.
mr.
garrett,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you,
you
describe
it,
mr.
garrett,
as
a
motion
to
increase
compensatory
damages.
yet,
it's,
it's
styled
a
motion
for
prejudgment
interest.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
supposing
a
judgment
awards
me
of
a,
a
particular
amount
in
damages
but
fails
to
specify
interest
from
the
date
of
judgment.
is
that
automatic,
or
do
i
have
to
move
under
rule
<fifty-nine
e@l>
[=
59(e)]
to
incorporate
a
provision
for
interest
from
the
date
of
judgment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
now,
i'm
talking
about
interest,
post-judgment
interest.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
mr.
garrett,
before
the
decision
in
white
against
new
hampshire,
certainly
people
would
have
said
that
attorney's
fees
were
not
an
exception
to
the
rule
you're
talking
about
i
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
unless
you
wish
to
waive
the
puritive--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr....
mr.
garrett,
have
you
had
experience
in
responding
or
making
these
motions
for
prejudgment
interest
in
cases
like
this?
what
i'm
curious
about,
does
the
trial
court
actually
hold
a
hearing
and
hear
witnesses,
or...
as
you
suggest?
or
does
he
simply
base
his
ruling
on
what
he
heard
at
the
trial?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
at
trial.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
garrett.
ms.
daniel,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
daniel,
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
87-1201
osterneck
versus
ernst
&
whinney
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
