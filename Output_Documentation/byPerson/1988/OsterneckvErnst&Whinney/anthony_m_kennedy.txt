justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
on
your
unique
circumstances
argument,
you
recited
for
us
the
factors
in
your
favor.
i
suppose
on
the
other
side
of
the
scale
is
the
fact
that
the
district
judge
said
that
he
would
have
to
amend
the
judgment
if
your
motion
was
granted.
that,
i
take
it,
weighs
against
you
in
this
calculus.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
case
number
87-1201
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
after
receiving
a
judgment
partially
in
their
favor,
the
petitioners
filed
a
motion
for
prejudgment
interest.
while
the
motion
was
pending,
they
also
filed
a
notice
of
appeal.
that
notice
of
appeal
was
ineffective
if
the
petitioner's
motion
for
prejudgment
interest
is
considered
a
motion
to
alter
or
amend
the
judgment,
and
the
two
relevant
rules
are
the
federal
ruled
of
appellant
procedures
4(a)(4)
and
the
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
59(e).
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
a
motion
for
discretionary
prejudgment
interest
filed
after
the
entry
of
judgment
constitutes
a
rule
59(e)
motion
and
therefore,
petitioner's
notice
of
appeal
was
ineffective.
our
conclusion
that
a
post-judgment
motion
for
discretionary
prejudgment
interest
is
a
rule
59(e)
motion.
we
help
further
the
important
goal
of
avoiding
piecemeal
of
appellant
review
of
judgments.
by
preventing
the
appellant
review
before
a
motion
for
prejudgment
interest
is
resolved.
the
rule
we
adopt
today
gives
added
assurance
that
an
appellant
court
will
have
the
benefit
of
the
district
court's
plenary
findings
with
regard
to
the
factual
and
legal
issues
that
are
subsumed
in
the
decision
to
grant
discretionary
prejudgment
interest.
we
also
reject
on
the
record
of
this
case
petitioner's
claim
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
heard
their
appeal
based
on
the
unique
circumstances
doctrine.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
