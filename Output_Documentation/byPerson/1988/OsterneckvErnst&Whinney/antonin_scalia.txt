what
difference
does
that
make?
part
of
your
argument
is
that
it
has
to
change
the...
the
prior
judgment
in
some
way?
what
if
he
had
added
punitive
damages?
that
wouldn't
change
anything
in
the
prior
judgment
either,
but
you
wouldn't
assert
that
that
somehow
is
not
a
new
judgment,
does
not
extend
the
judgment.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
understand
that.
but
assume
he
did.
assume
he
did.
assume
he
did
erroneously.
the
question
would
be
whether
the
judgment
is
appealable
or
when
the
judgment
is
appealable.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
he
had
said
you
asked
for
it,
you
got
it.
incorrectly,
but
nonetheless
would
that,
that
wouldn't
change
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
wouldn't
affect
the
finality
of
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
a
federal
statute
that
specifically
authorizes
the
judge
to
impose
punitive
damages?
the
judge,
as
opposed
to
the
jury.
you
get
a
jury
verdict,
and
the
judge
says
i'm
going
to
take
under
advisement
the
punitive
damages
issue.
and
then
a
month
later
he
awards
punitive
damages.
when
is
that
matter
appealable?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
we'd
have
two
appeals
up
here:
one
from
the
jury
verdict,
and
one
from
the
punitive
damages?
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
ms.
daniel,
i
think
we
said
in
budinich
or
we
conceded
in
budinich
that
there
is
some
elements
of
the
attorney's
fees
point
that
seem
maybe
not,
not
part
of...
not
part
of
the
merits.
some
do
and
some
don't.
and
we
said
we
were
just
going
to
cut
the
gordian
knot
and
treat
all
attorney's
fees
awards
the
same
for
purposes
of
consistency.
so,
the
mere
fact
that
there
are
some
elements
of
attorney's
fees
that
may...
that
may
support
your
case
doesn't
prove
anything.
we
acknowledged
that
in
budinich.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
daniel,
i
don't,
i
don't...
i
keep
coming
back
to
that.
i
really
can't
believe
it's...
i
can't
believe
it's
true.
suppose
you
have
a
bench
trial,
the
trial
is
to
the
judge.
and
let's
assume
there
are...
there
are
10
injuries
that
the
plaintiff
received,
and
the...
and
the
judge
issues
a
judgment
dealing
with
10
of
them.
he
says
nothing
at
all
about
the
eleventh.
he
deals
with
10
and
he
awards
a
certain
amount
of
money
damages
for
each
of
the
10.
then
there's
a
motion.
your
honor,
you
forgot
about
the
eleventh.
will
you
amend
the
judgment
to
include
the
eleventh
injury
and
to
give
us
monetary
damages
for
that
eleventh
injury?
now,
the
previous
judgment
said
nothing
at
all
about
that
eleventh.
it
just...
just
left
it
out.
now,
you
would
say
that
would
not
be
covered
by
59(e)?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
well,
54(b)
really
only
speaks
of,
of
when
not,
not
how.
it
says
may
direct
entry
as
to
one
or
more,
but
fewer
than
all,
only
upon
an
express
determination,
that
there
is
no
just
reason
for
delay
and
upon
express
direction
for
the
entry
of
judgment.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
what
it's
talking
about
is
you
can't
do
it
sooner
as
to
some
than,
than
as
to
others.
but
i
don't
think
it
really
speaks
to
whether
you
can
enter
a
separate
judgment
for
each
of
them
simultaneously,
which
is
what
justice
stevens
is
asking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's...
that's
a
solution
for
all
piecemeal
appeals.
i
mean,
you
could
shrug
your
shoulder
about
any
piecemeal
appeal
by
saying,
well,
you
can...
you
know,
if
it's
any
problem,
you
can
consolidate
it.
