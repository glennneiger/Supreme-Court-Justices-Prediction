bring
me
up
to
date.
is
the...
is
ernst
&
whinney
an
outgrowth
of
the
old
ernst
&
ernst
firm?

harry

of
the...

of
the
big
eight?
justice

ms.
daniel,
if
you
should
not
prevail
here,
are
you
completely
out
of
court
so
far
as
ernst
&
whinney
are
concerned?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
somewhere...
i
think
it
was
in
the
eleventh
circuit's
opinion...
i
saw
a
reference
to
a
pending
motion
in
the
district
court
for
an
extension
of
time
in
which
to
file
a
new
appeal.
what
has
happened
to
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
you
say
that
again?
