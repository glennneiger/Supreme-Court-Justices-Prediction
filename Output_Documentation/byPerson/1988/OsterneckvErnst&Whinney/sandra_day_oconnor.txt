well,
it's...
it
remedies
the
injury
giving
rise
to
the
cause
of
action,
doesn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
think
the
general
rule
is
that
prejudgment
interest
does
arise
from
the
operative
facts
that
created
the
right
to
recover
the
principal.
in
other
words,
if
you
didn't
have
that
right,
you
wouldn't
have
prejudgment
interest;
and
they're
linked,
as
compensation.
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--what
if
the
state
rule
on
prejudgment
interest
made
it
mandatory
and
automatic?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
then
would
its
omission
be
treated
as
a
clerical
error
under
rule
60(a)?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
if
that
were
omitted,
would
it
fall
within
a
clerical
error
under
rule
60(a)?
