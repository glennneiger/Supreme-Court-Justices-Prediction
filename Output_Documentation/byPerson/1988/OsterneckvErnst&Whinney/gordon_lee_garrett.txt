mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
although
couched
in
rule
59(e)
terms,
the
real
question
presented
here
is
whether
a
judgment
of
determining
plaintiff'
compensatory
damages
can
be
appealed
while
there
is
a
pending
request
for
additional
compensation
on
the
very
same
claim
in
the
form
of
prejudgment
interest.
specifically,
the
issue
is
whether
a
post-judgment
motion
seeking
to
change
the
original
judgment
by
adding
discretionary
prejudgment
interest
to
plaintiffs'
recovery
is
properly
denominated
as
a
motion
to
alter
or
amend
the
judgment
pursuant
to
rule
59(e).
petitioners'
post-judgment
motion
filed
within
10
days
after
the
entry
of
judgment
sought,
based
on
the
literal
language
of
rule
59(e),
to
alter
or
amend
the
judgment
by
increasing
the
compensatory
damages
awarded.
in
addition
to
rule
59(e)'s
literal
language,
we
believe
that
important
principles
of
finality
require
treatment
of
petitioners'
motion
to
increase
their
compensatory
damage
award
within
rule
59(e)
except
in
rare
circumstances--
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
--that's
correct.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
makes
no
difference
how
one
styles
a
motion.
the
effect
of
that
motion
was
to
increase
by
nearly
a
million
dollars
the
damages
awarded
to
the
plaintiffs
for
the
injury
they
claimed
they
received.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
it
depends
on
whether
or
not,
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
you're
entitled
prejudgment
interest
under
either
case
law
or
statutory
law.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
oh,
post-judgment?
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
post-judgment
interest
can
be
handled
simply
as
a
clerical
mistake.
you're
entitled
to--
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
--under
rule
60.
post-judgment
interest,
of
course,
is
automatic
under
most
state
and
federal
laws,
and
that
could
be
handled
as
a
ministerial
or
clerical
mistake
as
i
believe
the
decisions
of
the
courts
have
so
held.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
it
seems--
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
--it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
most
state
statutes
which
do
mandate
prejudgment
interest
are
very
specific.
they
describe
an
interest
rate
and
state
that
one
is
automatically
entitled.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
they
would
not--
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
because
to
me
it
is
no
different
than
the
post-judgment
interest,
which
is
also
mandatory.
as
i
was
saying--
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
--messrs.
talley
and
kellar
appealed.
barwick
industries
and
barwick
appealed,
although
their
appeals
were
later
abandoned
because
of
failure
to
comply
with
eleventh
circuit
rules.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
they
appealed
on
july
29,
my
recollection
is,
from
not
only
the
original
judgment
on
january
30th--
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
--the
prejudgment
interest
award
and
the
amended
judgment
which
came
out
on
july,
july
the
9th,
which
was
a
result
of
the
increase.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
we
wouldn't
have
all
this
fussing
and
we
wouldn't
be
here.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
rule
59(e)
and
rule
4(a)(4)
of
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure
help
implement
the
requirement
of
finality
by
precluding
premature
appeals
by
any
party
until
the
district
court
has
had
an
opportunity
to
resolve
post-judgment
issues.
once
resolved
in
the
district
court,
the
issues
raised
in
the
post-judgment
motion
seeking
to
alter
or
amend
the
judgment
can
be
reviewed,
along
with
all
other
issues
before
the
district
court
in
a
single
appeal
to
the
circuit
court.
the
longstanding
policy
precluding
piecemeal
appeals
is
particularly
appropriate
in
cases
such
as
the
one
here
involving
multiple
parties
and
issues.
here
the
eleventh
circuit
correctly
determined
that
a
post-judgment
motion
filed
within
the
10
days
prescribed
by
rule
59(e)
seeking
to
and
prejudgment
interest
is
a
rule
59(e)
motion.
accordingly,
the
eleventh
circuit
correctly
held
that
under
rule
4
of
the
rules
of
appellate
procedure,
petitioners'
notices
of
appeal
filed
before
the
resolution
of
their
post-judgment
motion
had
no
effect
and
properly
dismissed
the
appeal
against
ernst
&
whinney
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
we
believe
that
this
case
presents
a
clear
opportunity
for
the
court
to
ensure
that
rule
59(e)
and
appellate
rule
4(a)(4)
are
applied
consistently
to
achieve
prompt
resolution
and
unified
appeal
of
issues
which
should
be
decided
together.
the
court
has
established
that
attorney's
fees
and
costs,
divorced
from
the
merits
by
tradition
in
rule
58,
are
outside
rule
59(e).
here
the
court
can
confirm
that
post-judgment
motions
for
relief
traditionally
encompassed
within
the
merits
relating
to
a
plaintiff's
compensatory
damage
award
remain
within
rule
59(e).
section
1291
of
the
judicial
code--
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i
do
not
believe
it's
compensatory.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
it's
necessary,
but
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
--it
is
compensatory
in
nature.
prejudgment
interest
is
compensatory
in
this
particular
case.
i
think
the
decision
dealing
with
59(e)
can
be
certainly
much
broader.
section
1291
of
the
judicial
code
confers
appellate
jurisdiction
upon
the
courts
of
appeal
only
from
final
decisions.
the
court
has
consistently
recognized
that
the
final
judgment
rule
is
the
dominant
rule
in
federal
appellate
practice.
the
purpose
of
the
rule
is
to
combine
in
one
review
all
stages
of
the
proceeding
that
effectively
may
be
reviewed
and
corrected
if
and
when
final
judgment
results.
rule
59(e)
and
4(a)(4)
help
implement
this
policy
by
securing
complete
decisions
for
unified
relief.
59(e)
requires
that
motions
to
alter
or
amend
a
judgment
be
filed
within
10
days.
that's
the
same
time
limitation
found
in
rule
50(b),
a
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict;
rule
52(b),
a
motion
to
amend
findings;
and
rule
59(b),
a
motion
for
new
trial.
these
rules,
together
with
rule
4(a)(4),
ensure
that
requests
to
the
trial
court
for
further
decisions
affecting
a
judgment
are
made
promptly
after
entry
of
judgment.
and,
of
course,
under
rule
4(a)(4),
which
was
amended
in
1979,
where
any
party
files
any
of
those
motions,
the
time
for
appeal
by
all
parties
runs
from
entry
of
the
order
resolving
the
motion.
a
new
notice
of
appeal
must
be
filed
from
the
entry
of
the
order.
as
this
court
recognized
in
griggs,
that
is
mandatory
and
jurisdictional.
by
precluding
appellate
jurisdiction
until
the
district
court
completely
resolves
all
issues
affecting
the
judgment,
rule
4(a)(4)
and
civil
rule
59(e)
implement
the
final
judgment
rule.
here
until
petitioners'
motion
for
prejudgment
interest
was
decided,
the
litigation
on
the
merits
was
not
over
and
the
judgment
was
not
yet
right
for
execution.
the
district
court
had
not
yet
resolved
all
of
the
elements
of
their
damage
claim
recoverable
by
petitioners,
nor
did
it
finally
establish
the
amount
of
that
recovery.
to
allow
an
appeal
of
a
judgment
before
a
plaintiff's
entitlement
to
discretionary
prejudgment
interest
is
resolved
by
the
district
court,
we
believe
would
contravene
the
requirements
of
section
1291
to
effect
simultaneous
appeals.
thus,
the
traditional
treatment
of
post-judgment
requests
for
discretionary
prejudgment
interest
as
within
59(e)
and
not
independently
appealable
is
consistent
with
the
unitary
appeal
rule
set
forth
in
section
1291.
treating
petitioners'
request
for
prejudgment
interest
as
an
independent
proceeding
and
permitting
a
separate
appeal
from
the
judgment
establishing
other
elements
of
compensation
on
the
very
same
claim
ignores
important
considerations
of
finality.
and
most
importantly,
petitioners
advance
no
cogent
reason
why
an
award
of
discretionary
prejudgment
interest
should
be
an
exception
to
1291
requirement
of
a
unified
appeal.
narrow
exceptions
to
the
requirement
of
a
single
appeal
exist
only
pursuant
to
statutory
authorization
or
where
certain
decisions
of
the
district
court
are
completely
separate
from
the
merits
and
necessity
or
long
tradition
mandate
separate
appellate
review.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
one
had
examined
attorney's
fees,
they
have
traditionally
been
associated
with
costs.
they
are
taxed
as
costs.
and
costs
by
statute
are...
excuse
me...
the
judgment
is
not
delayed
for
entry
because
of
costs.
now,
some
courts
split
on
that,
but
it's
clear
if
you
follow
the
traditional
analysis
of
attorney's
fees
and
costs,
you
would
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
white...
court
did
in
white.
as
i
said,
narrow
exceptions
do
exist
to
the
final
judgment
rule.
most
of
the
exceptions
are
statutory
in
nature
relating
to
review
of
pre-verdict
and
prejudgment
orders
where,
for
example,
under
rule
54(b)
in
an
action
involving
multiple
claims
of
parties,
the
district
court
makes
an
express
determination,
or
under
28
u.s.c.
1292(b)
where
the
district
court
specifically
finds
that
the
order
involves
a
controlling
question
of
law,
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
discretion
may
take
the
appeal.
we
are
aware
of
no
statutory
provision
which
authorizes
a
separate
appeal
of
a
district
court's
discretionary
award
of
prejudgment
interest.
prejudgment
interest
is
not
a
collateral
order,
and
it
does
not
fit
within
the
narrow
category
of
cases
supporting
appellate
review.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
well,
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
rule
54(b)
directly
addresses
that
issue.
where
there
are
multiple
claims
or
a
party,
no
judgment
is
entered
until
all
claims
against
all
parties
are
resolved
until...
unless
specific
steps
are
followed
by
the
district
court.
it
seems
to
me
54(b)
answers
that
question,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
i've
long
since--
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
--i've
long
since
learned
that
judges
can
do
most
anything.
[laughter]
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that
would
be
improper
under
rule
54,
that
you
can't
enter
three
separate
judgments
based
on
a
single
trial
against
multiple
parties,
that
that
would
be
improper
under
the
rule.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
that's
correct,
but
that's
not
appealable
by
the
very
terms
of
the
rule.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
that's
correct.
and,
of
course,
the
issue
before
this
court
does
not
relate
to
54(b).
there
was
no--
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
--express
finding.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
i,
i
think--
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
--i
think
he
had
to
do
it.
i
think
that's
exactly
what
the
rules
require.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
well,
i
think
that's
true.
but,
of
course,
rule
54(b)
really
relates
to
prejudgment
and
pre-verdict
matters.
there
is
really
no
reason
at
all
to
have
separate
judgments
once
you've
had
a
trial
and
you
have
a
pending
motion
to
change
the
compensatory
damages.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
that's
correct.
and
he
may
have
done
that
if
he
had
done
it
properly
and,
of
course,
he
did
not
do
that
here.
and
that
brings
us
directly,
we
believe,
within
rule
59
and
in
the
mandatory
provisions
of
rule
a(a)(4).
this
case,
as
i
said,
does
not
comply
with
the
very
limited
collateral
order
doctrine.
the
order
is
not...
or
excuse
me...
the
issue
as
to
prejudgment
interest
is
not
completely
separate
and
independent
from
the
merits,
and
there
are
no
strong
affirmative
reasons...
and
petitioners
point
to
none...
mandating
a
separate
appellate
review.
indeed,
the
most
recent
cases
from
this
court
seem
to
have
narrowed
the
collateral
order
doctrine
even
further.
the
order
must
conclusively
determine
the
disputed
question,
resolve
an
important
issue
completely
separate
from
the
merits
of
the
action,
and
be
so
that
it
is
effectively
unreviewable
on
appeal.
of
course,
that
definition
does
not
fit
this
case.
as
discussed
earlier,
the
federal
rules
of
civil
and
appellate
procedure
mandate
except
in
narrow
circumstances
that
the
district
court
consider
post-trial
motions
that
may
affect
the
verdict
or
judgment
before
a
unified
appeal
on
the
merits.
separate
review
of
post-verdict
and
post-judgment
motions
are
even
more
limited
than
pre-verdict
and
judgment
review.
by
statute,
rule
58,
of
course
entry
of
judgment
shall
not
be
delayed
for
the
taxing
of
cost.
therefore,
you
can
have
a
final
judgment
even
though
tax
are
not...
excuse
me...
costs
are
not
taxed.
and
this
court
we
believe
effectively
importing
the
narrow
exceptions
in
cohen
into
the
construction
of
rule
59(e)
held
that
a
prevailing
party's
request
for
attorney's
fees
raised
legal
issues
basically
collateral
to
the
main
cause
of
action,
put
forward
a
bright
line
test
that
their
award
was
separable,
and
that
the
judgment
not
including
attorney's
fees
was
final.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
court's
decisions
in
white
or
budinich
are
support
for
prejudgment
interest.
as
justice
scalia
mentioned,
we
believe
that
this
is
no
different
than
punitive
damages.
for
example,
the
fair
credit
reporting
act
specifically
states
that
punitive
damages
shall
be
decided
by
the
court.
if
that
were
the
case
and
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
for
the
defendant,
it
is
clear
that
you
could
not
appeal
from
the
judgment
entered
on
that
verdict
until
the
puritive
damage
issue
was
decided.
we
do
not
believe--
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
--unless
you
wish
to
waive
it.
that
is
absolutely
correct,
because
once
you
file
your
notice
of
appeal,
and
you
have
not
properly
moved
the
court,
then
the
district
court
loses
its
jurisdiction
and
the
case
goes
to
the
court
of
appeals.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
of
course,
as
the
court
said
in
budinich,
a
claim
for
attorney's
fees
is
not
a
part
of
the
merits
to
which
the
fees
pertain.
it
does
not
remedy
the
injury
giving
rise
to
the
action.
at
common
law,
attorney's
fees
were
regarded
as
an
element
of
costs
awarded
to
the
prevailing
party.
the
court
in
white
and
budinich
also
identified
positive,
affirmative
reasons
for
separating
attorney's
fees.
to
hold
otherwise
would
have
encouraged
piecemeal
litigation.
a
counsel
would
have
been
filing
fee
requests
after
what
appeared
to
be
final
orders
in
lengthy
civil
rights
litigation.
litigations
who...
excuse
me.
the
problem
also
occurred
because
counsel
would
not
have
an
opportunity
to
negotiate
private
settlements
of
their
fee.
now
here,
unlike
the
affirmative
policy
reading
supporting
appeals
of
collateral
orders,
there
are
no
affirmative
reasons
why
an
award
of
prejudgment
interest
is
independent
of
any
other
aspects
of
a
plaintiff's
damage
case.
here
an
award
of
prejudgment
interest
is
not
separable
from
fine
merits.
it
is
awarded
to
the
plaintiff
based
on
the
conduct
of
the
defendant.
unlike
attorney's
fees
and
costs,
it
is
not
awarded
to
a
prevailing
party.
a
defendant
is
not
entitled
to
prejudgment
interest.
the
court
considers
in
determining
whether
prejudgment
interest
should
be
awarded
the
very
conduct
of
the
defendant.
evidence
concerning
the
factors
can
be
presented
at
the
trial
court
during
the
trial
with
all
of
the
aspects...
all
other
aspects
of
the
plaintiff's
claim.
petitioners
failed
to
advance
any
affirmative
reasons
why
prejudgment
interest
should
be--
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
--well,
it
seems
to
me
there
are
several
ways
to
do
it.
obviously,
he
hears
the
underlying
evidence
of
the
conduct
of
the
defendants.
mr.
gordon

at
trial.
if
the
court
is
concerned
that
the
jury
should
not
hear
interest
rates
and
the
lost
use
of
money,
then
he
can
hold
a
separate
hearing
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
during
one
day
of
the
trial,
and
you
can
have
all
the
evidence
relating
to
the
prejudgment
interest
issue
before
the
trial
judge
so
he
can
make
a
decision
on
that
depending
on
what
the
jury
does.
alternatively,
if
the
issue
is
protracted,
he
may
wait
until
the
jury
returns
a
verdict.
if
the
jury
returns
a
verdict
for
the
defendants,
all
of
them,
the
issue
is
not
right
for
his
review
obviously.
otherwise,
he
could
do
what
he
did
here
and
hold
a
very
short
post-judgment
hearing
dealing
with
the
merits
and
then
amend
the
judgment
to
reflect
that.
so,
i
think
there
are
several
ways
to
do
it.
we
also
believe
that
the
test
suggested
by
the
petitioners
is
one
which
this
court
has
rejected
and
we
believe
that
they
fail.
basically,
as
we
understand
it,
petitioners,
state
that
any
motion
which
will
then
not
affect
a
previous
judgment
or
ruling
of
the
court
is
not
a
rule
59(e)
motion.
of
course,
that
clashes
with
the
court's
interpretation
of
1291
and
would
render
such
things
a
partial
summary
judgment
on
liability
appealable
because
then
compensatory
damages
would
not
affect
that
particular
issue.
and,
of
course,
it
would
permit
summary
judgment
for
one
defendant
in
a
multiparty
action
to
be
appealed.
of
course,
the
drafters
of
rule
54(b)
preclude
this
result
as
well
as
decisions
of
this
court.
finally,
we
believe
that
the
unique
circumstances
in
thompson
do
not
merit
reversal
of
this
case.
that
decision
we
believe
should
be
strictly
limited
to
its
facts
where
a
judge
affirmatively
misled
a
party
believing
that
a
post-trial
motion
was
timely
filed,
therefore,
indicating
to
the
party
that
it
did
not
file
a
notice
of
appeal
within
30
days
but
rather
file
it
within
the
time
period
after
the
pretrial
motion
was
disposed
of.
in
that
case,
four
judges
dissented,
we
believe
quite
correctly,
pointing
cut
that
to...
the
more
exceptions
we
have
to
the
rules,
the
more
mischief
we'll
have
in
our
system.
the
rules
are
technical
and
they
need
to
be
to
ensure
accuracy
in
appeals.
thank
you.
