justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
daniel,
in
your
brief
in
the
trial
court,
i
think
you
argued
that
one
of
the
factors
that
should
be
taken
into
account
in
deciding
whether
to
grant
prejudgment
interest
was
the
degree
of
personal
wrongdoing
on
the
part
of
the
defendants.
isn't
that
related
to
the
merits?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
you
can't
tell
by
looking
at
the
jury
verdict
what
that
degree
was.
you
have
to
know
something
about
the
facts
of
the
case,
don't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
daniel,
supposing
that
we
conclude
that
you're
wrong
on
the
major
issue...
i'm
not
saying
we
will...
and
then
this
same
sequence
of
events
happened
in
the
future,
notwithstanding
our
ruling
to
the
contrary,
would
that
make
any
difference?
i
mean,
could
special
circumstances
overrule
a
general
holding
that
this
is
or
is
not
a
rule
59(e)
motion
if
we
made
it
clear
in
this--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
garrett,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
facts
that
puzzle
me?
did
the...
i
understand
the
defendants
against
whom
the
judgment
and
the
prejudgment
interest
was
awarded...
they
also
appealed,
did
they
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
as
to
the
first
two
that
did
appeal,
they
appealed
from
the
original
judgment,
not
the
one
after
the...
the
prejudgment
interest.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
also
the
prejudgment
interest
award?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
they,
in
effect,
filed
two
notices
of
appeal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
the...
if
the
plaintiff
had
filed
a
second
notice
of
appeal
at
the
same
time,
we
wouldn't
have
all
this
fussing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
garrett,
can
i
ask
you
a,
a
question?
i
mentioned...
supposing
one
looked
at
the
judgment
of
this
case
and
said
it
really
is
three
separate
judgments
rather
than
three
paragraphs
of
one
judgment,
and
the
third
judgment
is
the
one
in
favor
of
your
client
as
against
the
plaintiff,
and
there
was
no
motion
to
alter
or
amend
that
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
the
judge
could
have
entered
three
separate
judgments
rather
than
one
in
three
paragraphs?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
which
event
your
case
would
collapse.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there
are
times
when
a
judge
will
enter
a
judgment
as
to
one
party.
say,
at
the
end
of
the
plaintiff's
case,
he
might
enter
a
judgment
totally
and
a
54(b)
order
to
go
with
it
and
dispose
of
that
portion
of
the
litigation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
would
be
if
he
made
the
right
order
under
<fifty-four
b@l>
[=
54(b)].
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
really
fortunate
that
he
put
it
all
in
one,
one
judgment,
i
guess,
in
your
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
except
for
the,
the
judge
might
think,
well,
the
case
is
over
as
to
ernst
&
whinney,
and
i
don't
want
to
be
fussing
around
with
prejudgment
interest.
that
was
no
reason
to
delay
the
appeal
relating
to
them
because
they're
not
involved
in
the
prejudgment
interest
fight.
