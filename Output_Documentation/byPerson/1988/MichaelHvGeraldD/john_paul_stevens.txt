justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
know
he
had
the
edge,
by
a
good
deal,
no.
i
mean,
the
facts
are
the
facts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
he
didn't
sue
carole,
did
he?
she's
not
a
party
to
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
she's
not
a
party
in
this
court
anyway.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
boraks,
i
think
i
interrupted
and
you
hadn't
really
answered
justice
scalia's
question.
how
can
you
say
that
at
the
time
the
lawsuit
was
filed
the
relationship
had
been
terminated
by
the
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
state
hadn't
done
anything.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
just
didn't
get
revitalized
by
the
state.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
it
was
over
as
of
the
time,
at
least
as
of
the
date
the
lawsuit
was
filed
there
was
no
relationship,
no
ongoing
relationship
between
your
client
and
the
child.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--would
you
have
a
constitutional
claim
if
the
order
of
the
court
had
been,
well,
i
think
the,
he's
the
natural
father,
but
i
don't
think
it's
in
the
best
interests
of
the
child
to
give
him
visitation
rights
or
to
enter
any
kind
of
a
declaration
in
the
case,
and
i'll
dismiss
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'll
assume
everything
you've
alleged
in
your
complaint
is
true,
and
granting
all
those
facts,
and
without
regard
to
the
statute
i
simply
will
deny
relief,
because
there's
a
family
here
that
i
don't
want
to
bust
up.
justice
john
paul
stevens
assuming
everything
alleged
in
the
complaint
is
true--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
he
just
said,
i
don't
need
a
hearing
to
establish
facts
that
are
not--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
had
lived
with
the
child
for
about
three
months.
justice
john
paul
stevens
january
through
march.
justice
john
paul
stevens
pardon
me?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
i
wanted
to
read
it,
what
do
i
do?
how
do
i
get
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
please
do.
this
business
of
courts
telling
other
people
not
to
read
their
opinions
is
a
little
bit
offensive
to
me.
mr.
hoffman,
if
we
were
to
find
that
michael
was
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
paternity,
would
california
law
permit
the
guardian
ad
litem
for
victoria
to
appear
at
that
hearing
and
be
heard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
i
have
a
question.
would
you
comment
on
the,
there's
an
allegation
in
the
complaint
that
the
natural
father
has
some
kind
of
a
genetic
disease
that
the,
his
descendants
might
also
have,
including
the
child
here,
i
suppose,
and
it
would
be
in
the
best
interests
of
the
child's
medical
future
and
all
to
have
that
fact
established
so
they
can
know
how
to
treat
her
if
the
problem
arose.
has
that
any
relevance
to
this
problem?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
victoria
asked
for
visitation?
that's
the
child?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
old
was
the
child
when
she
made
this--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
how
does
the
guardian
ad
litem
get
the
authority...
i
mean,
just,
well
i'm
a
little
puzzled
by
that.
