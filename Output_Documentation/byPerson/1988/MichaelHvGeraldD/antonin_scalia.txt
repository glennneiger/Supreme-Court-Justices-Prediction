how
long
was
that
period
in
all?
justice

when

give
you
nine.
justice
antonin
scalia
what,
what
was
the
other
period?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
contrasts
to
how
much
of
a
period
that
the
child
was
living
with
gerald?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
of
the
time
of
the
decision
below.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
boraks,
do
any
of
those
prior
decisions
involve
the
situation
where
the
relationship
has
already
been
terminated,
where
the
termination
is
not
imposed
by
the
state?
i
mean,
you
know,
the
classic
decision
of
ours
is
the
one
in
which
the
state
says
that
the
biological
parent
who's
been
raising
the
child
for
many
years
is
simply
automatically,
simply
by
reason
of
having
sired
the
child
out
of
wedlock,
not
a
fit
parent.
but
there
it
is
the
state
that
is
depriving
the
person
of
that
liberty
interest
by
terminating
the
relationship.
here
the
relationship
has
been
terminated,
not
by
the
state
but
by
the
mother
and
the,
and
the
marital
father
taking
the
child
away.
is
it
the
state
that's
terminating
the
liberty
interest
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
visitation
rights.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
asking
the
state
to
create
a
liberty
interest
that
he
doesn't
now
have.
as
the
litigation
begins,
he
has
no
access
to
the
child.
the
child
is
being
raised
by,
by
a
husband
and
wife,
and
he
is
not
allowed
to
visit.
now,
where
is
the
state
depriving
him
of
some,
something
that
he
now
has?
justice
antonin
scalia
who
terminated
that?
it
wasn't
the
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
the
court
could
find
that
a
particular
person
is
the
child's
father
and
yet
deny
that
person
custody,
and
indeed
forbid
that
person
from
even
seeing
the
child.
is
that
possible?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
have,
it
would
have
operative
significance
insofar
as
liability
for
support
is
concerned.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
have
a
father
who's
violent,
something
of
that
sort,
i
suppose
a
court
could
keep
the
child
away
from
that
father,
even
though
the
parentage
would
be
acknowledged
as
his.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
isn't
really
getting
to
see
the
child
that
is
necessarily
at
issue
in
this
lawsuit
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
doesn't
necessarily
go
along
with
acknowledgment
of
his
parentage.
