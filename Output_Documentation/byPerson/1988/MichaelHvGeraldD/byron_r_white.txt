justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
the
child
in
this
case
could,
if
the
parent,
if
parentage
was
proven,
could
ask
for
support.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but,
i
know
he
understood
it,
but
whether
he
understood
it
or
not--
justice
byron
r.
white
--i
suppose
the
child
could
press
for
support
if
the
child
proved
the
parentage.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
as
far
as
the
child
is
concerned
it
seems
to
me
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
whether
there's
been
a
father-child
relationship
established.
as
far
as
the
child
is
concerned
the
child
can,
if
you
can
prove
parenthood,
can
get
support.
and
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
for
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
absent,
absent
this
relationship
you
talk
about,
if
gerald
had,
had
asked
to
adopt
the
girl...
victoria,
is
that
her
name?
justice
byron
r.
white
would,
would
he
have
had
to
give
notice
to
michael?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
mother
in
that
case
acting
on
behalf
of
the
child?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
whether
or
not--
justice
byron
r.
white
--whether
or
not
there's
been
any
relationship
between
the
biological
father
and
the
child,
the
mother
and
the
child
are
entitled
to
go
after
him
for
support.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
daughter
has
a
right
to
have
a
hearing
as
to
whether
that
father,
that
person
is
her
father.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
my
example,
an
unwilling
biological
father
can
be
sued
by
the
mother
and
the
child
for
support.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
both
are
entitled
to
a
hearing
to
establish
paternity.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
that,
you
mean
that
statute
would
also
bar
the
mother
and
the
daughter
from
suing
the
biological
father,
if
the
mother
is,
was
married
to
someone
else
at
the
time
of
conception?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
the
husband
has
become
incapacitated
and
can't
work
and
has
no
money
and
can't
support
the
child,
and
there's
the
biological
father
down
the
street,
can
the
mother
and
the
child--
justice
byron
r.
white
--so
the
answer
is,
the
california
statute
bars
their
action
as
well?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if,
what
if
the
father,
what
if
the
husband
has
died?
he
was
the
husband
at
the
time
of
conception,
but
then
he's
died?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
he
would,
you
would
think
that
for
the
same
reasons
she
would
have
the
right
to
a
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
as
long
as,
as
long
as
the
husband
is
alive
and
able
to
support
and
is
supporting,
the
child
may
not
go
after
the
biological
father.
justice
byron
r.
white
even,
even
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
the
right
to
inherit?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
carole
had
never
gone
back
to
gerald,
and
was
living
with,
just
living
with
michael,
could
they
have
together
gone
to
court
and
had
michael
declared--
justice
byron
r.
white
--this
presumption
would
not
have
applied?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now,
is
that...
why
does,
why
does
this
presumption
statute
permit
that?
by
its
terms,
or
by
another
provision?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
so
suppose
the
husband
takes
this
action
and
he
wants
to
prove
that
michael
is
the
biological
father.
so
he
proves
it,
then
what
happens?
support?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
to
michael?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
what,
what
benefit
does
the
husband
get?
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
he's
entitled
to,
he's
entitled
to
have,
to
prove
that
the
biological
father
is
the
father,
isn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
well,
what
would
he
get
out
of
it?
would
he
be
going
after
support
for
the
child?
or,
he
isn't...
is
he,
is
he
intending
to
give
up
custody?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
could
just
say,
well
i
want,
i
want,
i
like
the
child,
i
want
the
child
to
live
with
me,
but
i
just
want
to
collect
from
the
biological
father.
