justice

we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
87-746,
michael
h.
and
victoria
d.
v.
gerald
d..
mr.
boraks,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
was
while
the
mother
was
married
to
gerald,
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
have
never
been
divorced?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
any
time
a
wife
has
a
child
by
somebody
other
than
the
husband
it
kind
of
becomes
a
menage
a
trois?
the
lover
is
introduced
into
the
structural
relationship
of
the
marriage.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
with
one,
one
week,
you
said,
would
be
enough.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
would
be,
it
would
be
a
factual
determination
in
every
case.
i
mean,
if
you
can't
tell,
if
it's
strictly
a
question
of,
you
know,
how
does
it
grab
you,
the
state
can't
lay
down
any
rule.
it's
got
to
have
a
hearing
every
time
this
happens,
and
the
lover-father
wants
to
get
in
the
act.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that's
tautological.
well,
what,
what
relationship
does
qualify
for
a
liberty
interest?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if,
what
if
the
natural
father
comes
over
to
the
house
and
says,
i
want
to
see
my
natural
father,
the
husband
says,
get
out
of
here.
now,
is
the
natural
father
entitled
to
pursue
that
relationship
even
though
the
husband
does
not
want
him
to?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
boraks.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
hoffman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that's
true
even
though
the
mother
was
married
at
all
times
to
someone
else?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
many
votes
in
the
supreme
court
of
california
does
it
take
to
decertify
an
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
can't
even
be
published,
can
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
ca
report.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
in
effect
its
application
depends
to
a
certain
extent
on
the
position
the
mother
takes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that's
where
the
presumption
applies.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hoffman.
mr.
boraks,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
boraks.
the
case
is
submitted.
