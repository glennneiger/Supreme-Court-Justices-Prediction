mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
before
the
court
is
the
case
of
a
natural
father
whose
claim
of
paternity
was
precluded
by
the
operation
of
a
california
state
statute,
which
had
the
effect
of
terminating
an
existing
parent-child
relationship.
also
before
the
court
is
the
natural
father's
daughter,
who
is
represented
by
a
court-appointed
independent
guardian
ad
litem.
both
are
here
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
that
california
statute.
with
the
court's
permission
i
would
like
to
begin
with
a
synopsis
of
the
pertinent
facts
in
this
case.
in
the
fall
of
1980,
michael
was
having
an
intimate
relationship
with
carole,
who
was
married
to
gerald.
carole
became
pregnant
with
michael's
child.
victoria,
the
child,
was
born
in
may
of
1981.
michael,
carole
and
victoria
subsequently
had
an
hla
test
done
which
showed
a
98.06,
i
believe,
percent
probability
of
paternity.
in
november
of
1982,
michael
filed
suit
in
the
california
courts
to
have
himself
declared
victoria's
father.
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
i
believe
that
all
of
the
events
i'm
describing,
your
honor,
occurred
while--
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
--not
to
my
knowledge.
certainly
not
as
of
the
end
of
the
record
in
this
case.
in
his
suit
michael
asked
to
be
declared
victoria's
father,
he
asked
that
the
court
set
a
reasonable
support
level
for
him
to
provide,
and
he
asked
for
the
court
to
allow
him
visitation.
after
the
suit
was
filed,
there
came
a
time
when
carole
and
victoria
lived
with
michael,
and
they
lived
with
michael
throughout
most
of
the
third
year
of
victoria's
life.
during
that
period
michael
was
held
out
by
carole
and
by
himself
to
the
world
and
to
victoria
as
victoria's
father.
he
cared
for
the
child,
he
supported
the
child
and
the
mother,
and
in
all
respects
he
assumed
the
role
of
father.
and
as
a
consequence,
victoria
came
to
know
him
as
her
daddy
and
a
parent-child
relationship
developed
between
the
two
of
them.
this
lasted
until
around
may
of
1984
when
carole
broke
up
with
michael.
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
there
were
two
separate
periods,
the
one
i've
just
described--
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
--as
i
say,
there
were
two
separate
periods.
the
one
i
just
described
was
from
about
august
of
1983
till
around
late
april,
early
may
of
1984.
eight,
nine,
maybe
10
months.
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
i
accept
your
arithmetic.
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
the
other
period
was
a
period
in,
for
about
three
months
in
early
1982,
january,
february,
and
march.
i'm
not
sure
exactly
how
many
days
or
whether
it
was
a
full
three
months
or
only
part
of
that
quarter,
but--
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
--as
of
may
of
1984?
or
as,
as
of
what
point
in
time...
as
of
may
of
1984--
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
--oh,
as
of
the
time...
in
january
of
1985,
as
of
the
time
of
the
summary
judgment
being
granted
to
gerald,
i
would
say
that
gerald
probably
had
the
edge
in
terms
of
time.
but
i'm
not
sure
by
how
much.
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
well,
yes,
they
are,
and
i'm
not
trying
to
play
with
them.
i
don't
think
it
was
by
a
good
deal,
your
honor.
i
think
maybe
by
three,
four
months.
but
i
don't
have,
i
don't
have
it
clearly
fixed
in
my
mind
what
the
discrepancy
might
have
been
as
of
that
point
in
time.
in
any
event,
after
carole
and
michael
broke
up,
the
court
below
awarded
michael
pendente
lite
visitation
for
a
period
of
time,
and
then
also
ordered
an
evaluation
of
the
situation
by
an
independent
court-appointed
psychologist.
and
that
evaluation
did
take
place
prior
to
the
granting
of
the
summary
judgment
motion.
the
psychologist
interviewed
and
examined
michael,
carole,
gerald
and
victoria,
wrote
an
extensive
report.
and
his
bottom-line
recommendation
was
that
michael
be
recognized
as
a
parent
of
victoria
and
allowed
visitation.
and
this
recommendation
was
based
solely
on
his
assessment,
that
is
they
psychologist's
assessment
of
what
was
in
victoria's
best
interest.
after
that
report
came
out,
gerald
filed
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
which
was
granted
in
january
of
1985.
in
granting
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
the
trial
court
applied
the
conclusive
presumption
of
california
evidence
code
section
621.
and
based
on
that
provision
he
adjudicated
gerald
to
be
the
father
and
terminated
the
relationship
between
michael
and
victoria.
what
section
621
says
is
that,
given
certain
predicate
facts,
a
child
conceived
by
a
married
woman
is
conclusively
presumed
to
the
child
of
that
woman's
husband.
michael
and
victoria
appealed,
and
the
summary
judgment
decision
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeal.
in
affirming
the
lower
court's
granting
of
summary
judgment,
i
believe
that
what
the
court
of
appeal
did
was
close
a
question
left
open
by
the
california
supreme
court
in
a
previous
case
called
michelle
w..
in
that
case
the
california
supreme
court
left
open
the
question
of
whether
section
621
could
be
constitutionally
applied
to
terminate
an
ongoing
parent-child
relationship.
the
court
of
appeal,
without
saying
so
explicitly
but
in
logic,
necessarily
answered
that
question,
yes.
and
in
our
view
erroneously
so.
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
well,
i'm
not
entirely
sure,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
she's
in
new
york.
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
she's
in
new
york
living
with
carole
and
gerald.
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
justice
o'connor.
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
yes,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
the
analysis
is
quantitative,
or
is
meant
to
be
in
those
cases.
i
believe
it's
qualitative.
i
believe
that
it
depends
on
the
quality
of
the
relationship
and
the
nature
of
the
conduct
of
the
natural
father.
i
believe--
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
--if,
if--
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
--if
that
were
enough,
in
fact,
which
i
doubt
it
could
be--
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
--no,
it's
qualitative,
but
there's
a
relationship
between
quantity
and
quality.
there's
a
relationship
between
the...
there's
a
connection,
a
logical
connection
involving
the
amount
of
time
it
takes
to
develop
a
qualitative
relationship
that
gives
rise
to
the
constitutional
rights.
i'm
not
qualified...
no
pun
intended...
but
i'm
not
qualified
to
say
what
that
period
of
time
is.
but
i
think
that
clearly
that
relationship
did
develop
on
this
record
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
well,
that
has
never--
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
--that
has
never...
custody
has
not
come
up
in
this
case.
certainly
it
would
involve
visitation.
i
think
it
involves
the
status,
the
legal
status
of
parentage,
and
to
borrow
a
phrase,
a
bundle
of
rights
attendant
to
that
legal
status.
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
i
can't
cite
chapter
and
verse
of
why
i
believe
this
is
so,
but
i
do
believe
that
the
child
would
be
entitled
to--
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
--i
believe
as
a
matter
of
california
law,
and
i
believe
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
i
think
that
they're
reciprocal
in
nature.
it's
a
symmetrical
concept.
the
relationship
involves
a
symmetry.
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
i
understand.
if
the
court
were
to
determine
that
michael
is
entitled
to
a
hearing,
i
believe
the
court
could
stop
there,
and
not
have
to
go
on
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
victoria
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
analysis.
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
well,
i
was
certainly
planning
to
argue
that
the
failure
to
hold
a
hearing,
the
failure
to
inquire
into,
on
the
merits
into
the
issue
of
where
her
best
interests
lay
is
a
constitutional
deprivation
with
respect
to
her.
and
i
had
not
planned
to
abandon
that
argument,
but
i
do
agree
that
what
you,
what
you
say,
justice
o'connor,
is
correct.
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
well,
with
whom
the
child
has
had
a
relationship?
that's
a
much
tougher
question.
i'm
not
sure
of
the
answer
to
that.
but
in
this
case
i
am
sure
of
the
answer.
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
the,
the
notion
of
a
support
obligation
was
inherent
in
michael
h.'s
complaint.
he
understood
that,
he
acknowledged
that--
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
--right.
even
if
he
didn't
understand
it--
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
--right.
michael
could
be
made
to
understand
his
support
obligation,
whether
he
understood
it
or
not.
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
well,
not
any
time,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
--no,
i
hope
i
didn't
say
that.
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that.
i
said
i
didn't
think
it
would
be.
but
i
wasn't
really
qualified
to
deal
with
how
much
time
it
takes
to
develop
the
qualitative
relationship
necessary
to--
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
--what
the
rule
has
to
be,
your
honor,
we
contend,
is
that
any
time
a
relationship
has
been
established
between
natural
father
and
natural
child
which
qualifies
for
a
liberty
interest
under
this
court's
test,
that
any
time
that
occurs
there
must
be
a
hearing.
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
it's
a
relationship
that
has
two
elements.
number
one,
biological
paternity
under
this
court's
decisions,
and
number
two,
action
by
the
natural
father
to
come
forward
and
grasp
the
opportunity
to
serve
as
father
in
fact
and
develop,
to
develop
a
father-child
relationship
with
his
natural
child.
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
well,
that's
harder
question,
and
not
one
that
i
have
to
answer
for
this
case.
but
i
would
answer
it,
no.
that
that's
not
required.
that
the
second
element
of
what
is
necessary
to
establish
a
liberty
interest
is
absent.
the
man
may,
the
natural
father
may
be
pursuing
that
element,
may
be
trying
to
get
that
element.
but
if
he
hasn't
gotten
it,
then
he
does
not
have
a
liberty
interest
under
this
court's
decisions.
and
the
problem
with
section
621
is
it
makes
no
distinction
between
two
distinct
subclasses,
natural
parents
who
have
developed
a
relationship,
and
natural
parents
who
have
not.
they're
treated
the
same.
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
well--
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
--i...
no,
i
don't
think
the
child
has
a
constitutional
right
in
the
absence
of
a
relationship
to
support.
i
think
that's
a
matter
that
could
be
committed
to
state
law,
and
that
california
could
say
that
a
child
is
not
entitled
to
support
from
a
natural
father
in
a
circumstance
covered
by
section
621
where
there
has
been
no
established
relationship.
i
think
california's
free
to
do
that
statutorily.
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
well,
the
reason
i
answered
the
chief
justice
the
way
i
do
is
because
i
feel
compelled
to
answer
within
the
parameters
of
this
court's
decision.
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
well,
i
don't
want
to
discourage
the
court
from
adopting
a
principle
that
mere
biological
paternity,
that
being
a
natural
father
in
and
of
itself
gives
rise
to
certain
rights.
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
well,
i've
only
not
argued
it.
i
don't
know
that
the
court
is
not
free
to
re-examine
the
limitations
of
lehr
v.
robertson
and
to
say
that,
upon
further
consideration,
the
question
wasn't
really
foreclosed
in
that
case
but
it
was
pretty
soundly
dealt
with,
that
upon
further
consideration
there
aren't
necessarily
two
elements
to
the
liberty
interest,
that
is
biology
and
the
assumption
of
parental
responsibilities,
but
mere
biology
has
attendant
to
it
certain
rights.
that
was,
that
idea
was
not
foreclosed
by
lehr
v.
robertson,
but
the
language
was
pretty
discouraging
in
terms
of
my
standing
and
making
an
argument
in
the
face
of
that,
that
mere
biology
would
suffice.
so
perhaps
i
chickened
out,
but...
it
feels,
i
feel
that
the
prudent
way
for
me
to
proceed
is
based
on
this
court's
decisions.
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
victoria.
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
absent
the
relationship,
justice
white.
not
as
i
read
this
court's
previous
decisions.
and
i'm
not
sure
what
the
answer
is
under
california
state
law.
i
believe
the
court
is
going
to
address
that
question
in
another
case.
but--
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
--yes,
your
honor.
because
before
the
ruling
on
the
summary
judgment
motion,
michael
had
visitation
rights.
the
relationship
between
michael
and
carole
was
not
terminated
by
the
state.
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
well,
he
had
an...
he
was
awarded
pendente
lite
visitation.
and
had
he
been
recognized
as
a
parent,
he
at
least
would
have
been
entitled
to
be
heard
on
the
question
of
continuing
visitation.
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
in
order
to
answer
that
question
i
think
one
has
to
focus,
has
to
look
at
a
particular
point
in
time.
as
of
november
of
1982,
he
had
some
relationship
with
the
child.
two
and
a
half,
three
months,
i'm
not
sure
exactly
what
point
in
time,
in
early
1982.
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
no.
carole
did.
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
well,
he
did
sue
her
originally.
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
but
it
was
gerald's
summary
judgment
motion
that
was
granted.
so--
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
--she's
not
a
party
in
this
court,
is
my
understanding.
your
honor,
i
just
want
to,
i
want
to
save
some
time
for
rebuttal,
but
i
want
to
kind
of
get
to
a
bottom-line
position
here.
what
we're
saying
is
that
whenever
one
finds
a
natural
father
who
has
developed
a
cognizable
liberty
interest
in
a
relationship
with
his
natural
child
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
that
that
relationship
cannot
be
terminated
by
the
state
absent
a
hearing
on
the
merits.
that
is,
where
the
positions
of
the
parties
and
the
interests
of
the
parties
are
examined--
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
--well--
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
--that's
true.
it
was
a
suit
between
private
parties.
but
ultimately
the
relationship
got
terminated
by
the
state.
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
well--
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
--well,
it
did,
it
did
go
on,
though,
your
honor,
after
the
suit
was
filed.
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
it
later
went
on.
i'm
not
saying
there
was
any
constitutional
deprivation
based
on
anything
the
state
did
prior
to
january
of
1985,
when
the
state
applied
section
621
to
rule
that
michael
had
no
parental
rights,
which
resulted
in
an
effective
termination--
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
--after
a
hearing
on
the
merits
of
that?
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
well,
without
a
hearing,
if
the
court
is
basing
it
on
the--
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
--yes.
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
right.
i
can
determine
the
best
interests
of
the
child
and
base
a
decision
on
that
factor
without
a
hearing,
i
would
say,
i
would
make
the
same
constitutional
claim.
that
it's
not
possible
to
make
that
kind
of
a
determination
without
a
hearing
involving
the
merits
of
that
question.
and
in
this
case
in
particular
the
only
evidence
there
is
in
the
record
as
to
what
was
in
victoria's
best
interest
is
the
suggestion
by
an
independent
psychologist
that
it
was
in
her
best
interests
that
a
relationship
continue.
now
a
court
is
not
bound
by
that,
certainly.
but
that
should
be
enough
to
suggest
that
failing
to
address
that
question
was
a
deprivation
of
constitutional
proportions.
i'd
like
to,
if
i
may,
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
say
something
about
what
happens
under
california
state
law
absent
the
so-called
conclusive
presumption,
if,
if
in
fact,
let's
say,
gerald
and
carole
had
not
been
cohabitating
for
the
month
during
which
victoria
was
conceived.
both
michael
as
a
person
who
took
the
child
into
his
home
and
held
the
child
out
as
his
own,
and
gerald
as
a
person
married
to
the
child's
mother,
would
be
presumed
father
under
the
california
statutory
scheme,
but
they
would
be
rebuttable
presumptions.
and
in
that
instance
a
hearing
would
be
held,
the
purpose
of
which
would
be
to
make
a
determination
based
on...
which
on
the
facts
is
founded
under
weightier
considerations
of
policy
and
logic.
that's
what
would
happen
in
this
case
absent
the
conclusive
presumption.
now,
i'd
like
to
say
something
about--
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
--i
think
the
presumption
is
geared
to
conception,
your
honor.
because
if
you
look--
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
--well,
if
you
look
at
the
statutory
scheme,
there's
a
whole
set
of
these
rebuttable
presumptions
that
have
to
do
with
the
status
of
marriage
as
of
the
time
of
the
child's
birth.
and
the
issue
of...
and
the
idea
of
cohabitation
really
seems
to
relate
to
conception
rather
than
birth.
i
would
like
to
say
something
about
visitation.
number
one,
victoria
did
ask
for
visitation.
and
number
two,
visitation
may
not
necessarily
go
along
with
michael's
ability
to
establish
his
paternity
here.
but
no
visitation
certainly
went
along
with
his
inability
to
establish
his
paternity.
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
well,
the
guardian
ad
litem
asked
for
visitation.
mr.
robert
a.w.
boraks
well,
i
think
the
guardian
ad
litem
has
an
obligation
to
act
in
what
she
perceived
to
be
the
child's
best
interest
under
the
circumstances.
i
think
the
authority
is
based
on
the
order
of
the
court
establishing
the
relationship.
and
lastly,
your
honors,
it
is
not
i
alone
who
stand
here
to
tell
you
that
the
relationship
was
significant
or
how
significant
or
whatever.
i'm
relying
on
what
the
california
court
of
appeal
found
and
what
it
based
its
decision
on,
which
is
that
we
appreciate
that
michael
h.
has
shown
an
interest
in
victoria
d.,
almost
since
her
birth,
has
established
an
affectionate
relationship
with
her,
and
has
at
times
even
contributed
to
her
support.
so
the
california
court
of
appeal
based
its
decision
on
the
assumption
that
there
was
a
relationship,
but
found
it,
the
implications
of
that
to
be
outweighed
by
the
state
interest.
and
our
position
is,
the
state
interests
are
legitimate
and
weighty,
but
they're
insufficient
to
justify
the
denial
of
any
right
to
be
heard
on
the
merits
of
the
contention
made
by
michael
or
victoria.
that's
all
i
have,
your
honor.
