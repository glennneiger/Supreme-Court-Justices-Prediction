mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
although
i
hadn't
intended
to
do
so,
i
think
i
should
begin
with
a
slight
reference
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
because
i
don't
think
all
of
the
facts
that
are
relevant
have
been
made
known
to
you
today
by
mr.
boraks.
i
represent
the
husband,
gerald.
it
is
gerald
who
was,
while
cohabiting
with
his
wife,
learns
that
his
wife
is
pregnant.
he
joins
her
in
lamaze
training,
he
participate
in
the
birth
of
the
child,
he
is
living
with
his
wife
and
his
daughter
during
her
early
months
and
doing
all
that
we
would
normally
expect
of
a
father
to
do
for
his
daughter.
on
the
child's
first
birthday
he
receives
a
telephone
call
from
michael
h.,
informing
him
for
the
first
time
of
michael's
claim
of
biological
responsibility.
six
months
later,
when
victoria
is
18
months
old,
michael
commences
this
action.
at
the
time
that
the
action
was
commenced,
michael
had
virtually
no
relationship
whatsoever
with
victoria.
i,
in
fact,
was
retained
as
counsel
for
carole
when
this
case
was
first
filed
and
she
was
first
served.
and
our
immediate
response
was
to
file
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
record
will
reflect
that
shortly
after
carole
responded
to
the
complaint
with
her
answer,
she
filed
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
at
that
time
there
was
no
relationship
that
mr.
boraks
speaks
of
that
may
have
given
michael
any
constitutionally
protected
interest
in
a
relationship
with
victoria.
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
the
three
months
that
i
think
mr.
boraks
refers
to
is--
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
--a
period
of
about
six-weeks--
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
--it
happens
to
span
the
end
of
january
to
the
beginning
of
march
of
1982,
which
was
when
victoria
was
approximately
seven
months
old.
and
carole
had
visited
michael
at
his
residence
in
the
virgin
islands.
and
that
was
during
a
period
of
separation
from
gerald.
the
relationship
that
mr.
boraks
refers
to
as
being
a
significant
one,
and
one
which
confers
on
michael
the
constitutional
right
to
interfere
with
the
relationship
between
carole
and
her
husband,
my
client,
is
one
that
developed
during
the
pendency
of
this
action.
when
carole
had
filed
a
summary
judgment
motion,
the
record
will
reflect
that
on
the
eve
of
the
hearing
there
was
a
meeting
that
occurs
between
michael
and
carole.
and
carole
then
took
her
motion
off
calendar,
and
then
allowed
access,
michael
access
to
victoria.
i
would
also
point
out
that
that
period,
that
eight
month
period
that
mr.
boraks
refers
to,
was
not
an
eight
consecutive
month
period.
there
were
periods
during
which
michael
was
not
in
los
angeles,
where
carole
and
victoria
were.
in
fact
by
my
count,
i
count
a
total
of,
over
that
eight
month
period,
of
approximately
100
days
that
michael
spent
in
the
house
with
victoria
and
with
carole.
and
when
carole
terminated
her
relationship
with
michael,
she
terminated
michael's
relationship
with
victoria.
carole
returned
then
to
her
husband,
and
she
has
since
been
living
with
her
husband
and
victoria
and
the
siblings
of
victoria
in
new
york.
you
are
being
asked
here
to
invalidate
a
longstanding
part
of
california's
paternity
law.
this
is
a
paternity
action
that
we're
dealing
with
here.
you're
being
told
that
the
statute
is
applied
blindly
and
mechanically
to
establish
the
fact,
by
presumption,
that
a
husband
invariably
in
every
case
is
the
man
who
is
responsible
for
the
conception
of
his
wife's
child.
that
is
a
misrepresentation
of
section
621's
purpose
or
of
its
effect.
what
section
621
is
is
a
rule
for
identifying
the
father
of
a
child
which
does
not
look
to
the
facts
of
conception
as
the
basis
for
identifying
the
man
on
whom
the
state
will
confer
the
rights
and
impose
the
obligations
of
paternity.
we
simply
don't
think
in
these
cases
that
the
fact
of
biological
responsibility
is
as
significant
as,
for
example,
in
the
traditional
paternity
action,
where
a
mother
is
asking
an
unwilling
man
who
denies
responsibility
and
will
have
no
relationship
with
the
child
to
suffer
the
obligation,
the
financial
obligations
of
raising
a
child
that
he
does
not
want
and
who
was
not
planned,
and
the
man
is
seeking
to
avoid
that
responsibility.
that
is
not
the--
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
--i
think
the
mother's
interests
are
coincident
with
the
child's
interests
in
respect
to
their
desire
for
support.
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
i
think
the
state's
interest
is
the
same.
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
precisely.
and
we
think
that
the
causal
relationship
between
a
man's
act
of
engaging
in
a
sexual
act
and
the
result
of
a
child
being
born
who
is
in
need
of
support
justifies--
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
--the
biological,
the
person
who's
biologically
responsible,
no,
because
in
this
case,
in
a
case
which
is
governed
by
section
621
where
there
is
a...
my
client
tells
you
that
you
don't
need
to
establish
the
support
obligation
of
michael.
there's
no
question
but
that
victoria
is
going
to
be
supported
no
matter
what
the
result
in
this
case.
my
client
too,
for
the
child's
entire
minority,
has
been
very
willing
to
support
her
and
has
supported
her.
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
the
issue
of
support
isn't
implicated
in
this
case.
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
yes.
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
his
support
obligation.
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
yes.
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
no.
not
in
a
case
governed
by
section
621.
and
it
isn't
only
the
fact
that
the
mother
is
married
at
all
times
to
someone
else.
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
it
would
stop
the
suit
from
going
forward,
assuming
that
the
husband
is
available
and
willing
to
assume
the
parental
responsibilities.
we
presume
in
all
cases
in
california
that
each
child
has
one
and
only
one
father,
and
in
that
man
we
impose
all
responsibilities
and
we
grant
all
rights
to
belong
to
the
father.
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
no.
we
don't
think
so.
i
think
that
if--
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
--if
the
husband...
the
california
statute
provides
that
one
man
will
be
recognized
as
the
father
of
this
child
for
all
purposes.
if
that
man
is
the
husband,
then
regardless
of
his
financial
situation
or
the
child's
needs
economically,
the
action
against
the
biological,
the
man
who's
biologically
responsible
would
be
barred.
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
have
a
case
in
california
called
in
re
lisa
r.
where
that's
exactly
what
happened,
and
the
california
supreme
court
tells
us
that
this
statute
is
not
blindly
and
mechanically
applied
in
every
case.
we
look
at
the
facts
and
we
see
if
the
state's
interest,
ensuring
the
child
a
father-child
relationship,
is
being
promoted.
when
the
father
is
dead,
and
in
lisa
r.
the
mother
too
was
dead,
the
answer
is
that
the
statute
cannot
constitutionally
be
applied.
in
this
case,
of
course,
gerald
is
very
much
alive
and
very
much
a
part
of
victoria's
life.
as
well,
we
have
another
case,
by
the
way,
a
more
recent
case,
which
was
cited
to
you
in
the
reply
brief
of
the
guardian
ad
litem
for
victoria.
i
should
say
at
the
outset
that
that
case
has
been
since
decertified
for
publication
and
i
think
is
not
citable
as
authority
in
california.
but
i
ought
to
mention
the
case
simply
to
point
out
that,
in
this
case,
it
was
the
putative
father
who
relied
on
section
621.
the
man
who
was
biologically
responsible,
who
in
that
case
had
established
a
relationship
with
the
child,
after
the
mother
and
the
husband
had
divorced,
with
the
husband
and
mother
agreeing
that
the
husband
was
not
the
father
of
the
child,
the
putative
father
assumed
that
responsibility
informally
when
he
then
separated
from
the
mother
after
a
period
of
about
17
months
of
living
with
the
child,
the
putative
father
then
stopped
paying
for
support
for
the
child,
the
mother
brought
an
action
against
him.
and
the
putative
father
relied
upon
section
621
arguing
that
you
can't
impose
the
responsibility
on
me,
section
621,
just
read
the
words
of
the
statute,
it
says
that
it's
the
husband
that's
responsible
and
not
me.
and
the
california
court
of
appeals
said
no,
because
section
621
doesn't
serve
its
intended
purpose
here.
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
i
believe
it's
five,
your
honor.
but
i
really
can't
be
certain.
the
effect
of
the
decertification
is
simply
that
the
case
is
not
cited
as
precedent.
the
court
also
denied
a
petition
for--
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
--it
is,
it's
not
official...
well,
it's
published
in
that
i
know
about
it,
i've
read
it.
but
it's
not
citable
as
authority.
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
it
will
not
appear
in
the
official
reports.
that's
correct.
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
i'll
be
happy
to
send
you
a
copy
of
it.
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
if
michael
were
entitled
to
establish
his
claim
of
biological
responsibility,
yes,
i
believe
that
she
would.
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
if
he
would
have
the
right
to
establish
the
responsibility,
i
think
mr.
boraks
agrees
that
that's
a
reflexive
relationship
there.
if
one
has
the
right--
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
--that's
correct.
and
the
biological--
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
for
all
purposes.
and
by
the
way,
i
would
point
out
that
one
of
the
major
issues
in
this
case
is
that,
once
we
determine
which
of
these
two
men
is
the
father
of
the
child,
that
man
becomes
the
father
for
all
purposes,
so
that
if
tomorrow
carole
were
to
die,
under
california
law,
the
father
would
have
the
sole
and
exclusive
right
to
custody.
and
if
carole
were
to
die
tomorrow,
or
the
day
after
tomorrow,
but
tomorrow
the
court
were
to
say
that
michael...
excuse
me...
is
entitled
to
recognition
as
victoria's
father,
victoria
would
be
removed
from
the
only
home
that
she's
known
since
her
birth,
and
required
then
by
the
law,
at
michael's
request
at
least,
to
reside
with
him.
so
we
think
that
the
scope
of
this
question
is
enormous.
and
i
think
all
of
these
matters
have
to
be
taken
into
account,
as
they
have
been
by
the
california
legislature
in
adopting
the
law,
and
the
california
courts
in
applying
and
interpreting
it.
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
well,
he
is
asking
to
be
recognized
as
victoria's
father.
that's
certainly
the
complaint
that
he
filed.
i
would
point
out
that
we
have
a
provision
under
california
law,
i
would
just
cite
it
in
the
briefs,
it's
section
4601
of
the
california
civil
code,
which
authorizes
the
court
to
award
visitation
to
any
person
if
the
court
determines
that
that
would
be
in
the
best
interests
of
the
child.
now,
michael
had
the
opportunity
to
bring
that
action,
which
would
have
been
brought,
of
course,
independent
of
this
claim
of
paternity.
that's
not
the
action
that
he
brought.
in
fact,
at
the
hearing
on
the
summary
judgment
motion,
michael
was,
at
michael's
counsel,
told
the
judge,
who
indicated
his
intention
to
rule
in
favor
of
gerald,
that,
well
your
honor,
if
you're
going
to
deny
me
my
claim
for
visitation,
for
paternity,
why
don't
you
then
award
me
visitation
under
section
4601?
and
the
court
responded,
because
you
haven't
asked
for
visitation
under
section
4601,
this
is
a
paternity
action.
if
you
think
you
have
the
right
to
that
relief,
file
an
action
and
ask
for
it.
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
the
presumption,
i
think,
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
right
to
that
relief.
i'm
assuming
that
if
section
4601
allows
the
court
to
award
visitation
to
non-parents,
then
the
presumption...
of
course
the
effect
that
it
has
is
that
it
puts
michael
on
a
much
different
standard
in
requesting
visitation
than
he
would
be
if
he
were
recognized
as
victoria's
father.
because
in
that,
under
4601,
insofar
as
it
relates
to
non-parents,
the
court
has
the
discretion
to
grant
or
not
grant
visitation
in
the
court's
discretion.
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
correct.
it's
irrelevant
that
he
claims
to
be
the
biological
father.
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
well,
if
he's
never
established
a
relationship
and
the
court
determines
that
this
is
a
person
who
does
not
have
an
interest
in
victoria's
welfare,
then
that's
correct.
then
he
would
not
have
the
opportunity
to
establish
court-ordered
visitation
with
victoria.
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
yes,
it
does.
as
has
been
indicated
earlier,
i
think
that
there's
been
a
misstatement
made
in
the
briefs
and
in
the
argument
here
concerning
the
way
in
which
section
621
works.
we've
been
told
that
621
acts
to
terminate
an
ongoing,
an
existing
relationship,
and
in
fact
that's
not
the
case
at
all.
it
is
the
mother
who
in
this
case
terminated
the
relationship
that
existed
between
victoria
and
michael.
the
only
purpose
served
by
the
statute
in
this
case
was
to
preserve
a
relationship.
and
the
relationship
that
it
preserved
was
a
relationship
of
my
client
with
victoria.
the
appellants
mentioned,
and
i
heard
the
argument
during
mr.
boraks'
time
up
here,
that
there
was
a
significant
relationship
that
existed
between
michael
and
victoria,
and
that
has
constitutional
significance.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
section
621
says
that
michael
has
no
opportunity
to
develop
a
relationship
with
victoria.
it
was
solely
by
reason
of
carole's
acquiescence
that
michael
even
had
a
chance
to
see
victoria
at
any
time
during
her
minority.
the
state
of
california
would
not
have
permitted
him,
had
she
been
more
resistant
to
his
efforts.
because
of
that,
i
think
that,
while
i
understand
mr.
boraks
wants
to
bring
this
case
under
the
cases
of
this
court
that
have
referred
to
the
significance
of
an
existing
relationship
between
father
and
child,
he
can't.
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
they
could
well
indeed,
your
honor,
under
the
statute
within
the
child's
first
two
years--
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
--the
mother
joined
by
an
acknowledgment
of
paternity
by
the
putative
father,
so
again
the
child
is
not
being
left
fatherless,
may
file
a
motion
which,
in
practice
what
it
does
is
it
requires
the
husband
then,
notwithstanding
the
provisions
of
section
621,
to
submit
to
a
blood
test
in
order
to
establish
the
facts
of
conception.
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
yes,
expressly
by
its
terms.
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
that's
right.
the
father
as
well...
the
husband
as
well,
excuse
me,
has
the
opportunity.
and
he,
without
the
acknowledgment
of
responsibility
by
the
putative
father,
also
within
the
first
two
years.
i
think
the
theory
underlying
those
two
exceptions
is...
well,
of
course,
in
this
case
we
have
mother
and
husband
united
in
a
family
wanting
to
raise
this
child
together.
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
that's
where
it
applies,
and
it
excludes
michael,
it
excludes
the
guardian
ad
litem
for
the
child.
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
the
whole
panoply
of
rights
and
obligations
that
are
available
to
him
as
the
father
are
available
to
him
at
that
point.
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
yes.
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
if
the
presumption
is
rebutted
by
the
mother,
who
cooperates--
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
--he
would
be
entitled
to
do
that
as
well,
if
that
were
in
his
interest.
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
if
a
husband...
maybe
i'm
misunderstanding
your
question.
if
the
husband
were
to
invoke
the
exception
to
section
621
and
say,
basically,
i
don't
want
to
be
responsible
for
this
child,
this
is
not
biologically
mine,
he
may
do
so,
and
avoid,
as
long
as
he
acts
within
the
first
two
years
so
that
no
relationship
develops
between
the
child
and
him,
because
the
thought
is
that
after
two
years
statutory--
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
--no,
that
he
cannot
do.
he
can't
have
it
both
ways.
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
i
think
to
the
extent
that
the
appellants
look
for
a
significant
relationship
between
themselves
in
order
to
come
under
the
protection,
the
rules
that
are
formulated
in
stanley
and
caban
and
lehr
and
quilloin,
they
do
themselves
a
disservice,
because
there
really
was
no
way
for
michael
to
have
established
a
relationship
with
victoria
by
coming
to
court.
he
was
subject
to
victoria's,
to
carole's
whims
in
that
regard.
and
i
think
that
there
simply
is
no
relevance
to
the
development
of
any
relationship
between
the
putative
father
and
the
child
in
cases
coming
under
section--
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
--the
presumption
would
remain
in
effect,
if
no
one
had
actually
taken
steps
to
rebut
it
during
that
period
of
time.
but
of
course
carole
and
michael
could
have,
within
those
three
year
period,
taken
the
action
that
they
needed
to
preserve
the
relationship--
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
--that's
correct.
there
has
also
been
discussion
of
whether
the
result
in
this
case
was
in
victoria's
best
interests.
we
don't
think
that
that's
relevant,
that
in
this
particular
case
it
makes
no
difference
whether
it
would
or
would
not
have
been
in
victoria's
best
interests
that
michael
be
recognized
as
her
father.
this
is
a
paternity
action.
and
in
paternity
cases
we
don't
determine
the
question
of
paternity
in...
in
those
cases
where
we
use
the
rule
of
biological
connection,
we
don't
consider
the
question
of
the
child's
best
interest
in
that
particular
case
in
deciding
whether
a
man
is
or
is
not
the
father,
we
look
to
the
facts.
we
look
to
the
fact
of
whether
there
was
intercourse
between
the
child
and
the
mother
which
resulted
in
the
child's
conception
and
ultimately
her
birth.
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
that's,
that
certainly
is
a
possible
result,
i
suppose,
in
these
cases.
in
other
words,
simply
a
hearing
to
establish
the
fact
of
a
biological
connection
with,
which
has
no
operative
significance?
i
think
that
certainly
could--
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
--so
he--
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
--that's
correct.
but
the
fact
that
the,
it
would
or
would
not
be
in
the
child's
best
interests
to
visit
with
that
particular
man
is
not
relevant
to
the
question
of
whether
he's
entitled
to
recognition
as
her
father.
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
i
think
that
to
some
degree
it
is,
certainly.
i
think
michael
would
say
that
that
was
his
prime
motivation
for
bringing
it.
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
that's
correct.
i
mean,
if
it
would
be
harmful
to
the
child
that
the
man
would
have
contact
with
her,
then
he
could
be
recognized
as
her
father
and
yet
kept
away
from
her.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
larry
m.
hoffman
--we
think
not.
i
mean,
if
in
fact
michael
were
victoria's
biological
father,
then
that
information
has
been
made
known
to
carole,
and
is
available
to
her.
and
unless
we
can
believe
that
carole
and
gerald
are
not
going
to
do
what
they
believe
to
be
in
the
best
interests
of
the
child
which
might
involve
genetic
counseling
for
the
child,
i
think
that
ought
not
to
have
any,
any
part
in
the
decision
of
whether
michael
is
or
is
not
entitled
to
recognition
as
victoria's
father.
but
those
are
questions
of
custody
and
support
and
visitation,
that's
what
follows
from
the
determination
of
paternity.
if
there's
an
interesting
fact
such
as
that
that
ought
to
be
made
known
to
victoria,
we
hope
that
it
will
be,
and
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
it
won't
be.
but
certainly
not
to
go
so
far
as
to
say
the
question
of
paternity,
where
the
law
identifies
a
particular
man
as
the
one
who
bears
that
legal
relationship
with
the
child,
ought
to
be
governed
by
facts
such
as
those.
