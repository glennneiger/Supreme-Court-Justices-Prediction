justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
somewhat
surprised
you
conceded
in
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice
that
the
father
does
not
have
the
right
to
establish
the
relation,
because
under
your
theory
of
the
case
it's
the
father's
natural
expectations,
his
great
desire
to
be
a
father
that
is
really
the
propelling
force
of
your
case.
it's
not
just
protecting
the
relation
that's
happened
for
seven
months.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
logical
thrust
of
your
case
would
require
you
to
answer
the
chief
justice's
question
differently,
that
the
father,
if
you
prevail,
does
have
this
right
to
establish
a
relation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we're
trying
to,
we're
trying
to
explore
the
dimensions
and
the
articulation
of
the
theory
that
we
would
have
to
adopt
in
order
to
rule
for
you
in
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
seemed
to
me
by
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice
you
foreclose
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
take
it
what
the
biological
father
is
asking
is
just
for
the
right
of
visitation.
and
if
we're
going
to
create
a
constitutional
right
and
define
it,
i
suppose
we
could
limit
that
way?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
your
position
on
whether,
does
the
presumption
effect
the
right
to
that
relief?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
if
you
were
the
judge
and
michael
brings
that
action,
and
he
puts
on
evidence,
he
says
i
want
to
show
that
i'm
the
father,
i
want
to
testify
that
i'm
the
biological
father,
i...
don't
you
exclude
that
evidence
based
on
the
presumption?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
so
then
he
really
can't,
then
he,
then
he's
standing
there
and
he
has
nothing
to
say
at
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
so
then
the
presumption
does
apply,
does
have
some
application
in
a
purely
visitation
proceeding.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
under
your
view
of
the
statute,
if
michael
had
lived
with
the
child
for
three
years,
and
then
the
husband
and
the
wife
had
re-united,
the
presumption
would
go
into
effect,
would
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
they
didn't,
the
presumption
goes
into
effect.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
presumption
apply
when
the
husband
and
wife
are
cohabiting
on
the
date
of
birth?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
california
cases
say
that?
