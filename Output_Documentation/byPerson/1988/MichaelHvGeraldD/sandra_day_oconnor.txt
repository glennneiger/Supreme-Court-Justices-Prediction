mr.
boraks--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--i
guess
this
court
has
articulated
the
view
that
the
biological
relationship
of
the
father
with
the
child
alone
is
not
sufficient
to
give
him
any
constitutionally
protected
liberty
interest
in
that
relationship.
there
has
to
be
something
more.
and
in
the
stanley
against
illinois
case,
i
believe,
the
father
had
lived
with
the
child
for
18
years.
and
in
the
caban
case,
i
think,
it
was
something
in
the
nature
of
four
years.
do
you
think
that
this
off
and
on
period
of
seven
or
eight
months
in
your
situation
representing
the
father
here
effectively
presents
a
substantial
relationship
of
that
nature?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
it
could
be
a
month
or
so
and
that
would
be
enough?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
a
week.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
it
is
quantitative
in
a
sense.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
you're
asking
for
on
behalf
of
the
father
is
a
recognition
of
a
right
to
a
hearing,
to
establish
the
parental
relationship.
is
that
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
there
any,
be
anything
at
issue
in
that
hearing
other
than
that
parental
relationship?
doesn't
involve
custody.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
visitation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
let
me
ask
you
this.
if
this
court
were
to
determine
that
the
father
was
entitled
to
some
hearing
to
establish
the
parental
relationship,
would
the
child
through
her
guardian
be
entitled,
under
california
law,
to
appear
at
that
hearing
and
to
be
represented
and
to
be
heard?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
as
a
matter
of
california
law.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
then
why
would
we
have
to
address
here
any
question
concerning
the
child's
constitutionally
protected
liberty
interest?
is
that
anything
that
we
have
to
determine
then
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
a
pretty
big
unanswered
question.
what
the
right
of
the
child
is,
apart
from
the
parent.
what
i'm
trying
to
explore
is
why
there's
any
need
to
determine
that,
if
in
any
event
she
would
be
entitled
to
be
heard
in
any
hearing
in
california.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
you
going
to
argue
here
this
morning
that
she
is
entitled
in
her
own
right
to
have
that
hearing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
suppose
there's
been
an
adoption
proceeding,
and
some
child
has
been
adopted.
now,
does
that
child
have
a
right
then
to
go
in
later
and
establish
a
parental
relationship
with
a
biological
parent?
