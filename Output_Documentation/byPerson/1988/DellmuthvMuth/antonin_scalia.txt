justice
antonin
scalia
counsel,
could
i...
maybe
i'm
coming
back
to
the
same
question
that
justice
o'connor
asked,
but
i
hadn't
understood,
or,
it
wasn't
clear
from
your
brief,
whether
if
we
find
for
you
on
point
1
in
your
brief,
you
also
expect
us
to
go
on
to
point
2?
justice
antonin
scalia
although...
was
there
any
relief
granted
below
other
than
money
damages?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
attorney's
fees?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
validity
of
which
would
depend
upon
the
validity
of
the
money
damages?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
you
had
no...
right?
if
you
couldn't
get...
if
you
couldn't...
if
you
couldn't
get
money
damages,
you
couldn't...
you
couldn't
get
attorney's
fees
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
plaintiff
would
lose.
i
mean,
if
the
only
thing
at
issue
was
money
damages
and
you
say,
"no,
plaintiff,
you
can't
get
money
damages.
"
therefore
you
lose,
you
couldn't
then
go
on
and
say,
"but
i'm
going
to
give
you
attorney's
fees.
"
could
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
was
it
asked
for?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
looks
to
me
like
if
we--
justice
antonin
scalia
then
i
don't
understand
why
you
say,
or,
why
it's
so
evident
to
you
that
congress
can
eliminate
states'
sovereign
immunity
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
mean,
the
point
is
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
this
is
either
a
statute
aimed
at
discrimination,
in
which
case
you
can
eliminate
states'
sovereign
immunity
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
understand
that.
but...
but
justice
stevens
asked
you
whether
you
conceded
that
congress
could
eliminate.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
well,
i'm
just
reiterating
what
justice
stevens
said
and
i
haven't
heard
a
good
answer
to
it.
you
tell
us,
on
the
one
hand,
that
it's
not
a
discrimination
statute.
but
you
say,
on
the
other
hand,
that
it
is.
because
there
is
no
fourteenth
amendment
power
unless
it's
directed
at
discrimination.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
he's
trying
to
help
you.
i--
[laughter]
i'd
take
that
one
and
go
with
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
clear
that
they
could
do
that?
is
it
clear
that
they...
well,
this
is
all
hypothetical
anyway
because
with
the
'86
act
it
doesn't
matter.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
this
is...
but
this
is
one
reason
why
the
original
act
should
not
be
read
in
this
fashion.
because
you
say
it
would
have
created
this
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
clear
that
there's
no
obstacle
to
seeking
such
relief
in
the
federal
district
court
without
going
through
the
procedures?
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
why
is
that
ground
not
affected
by
the
eleventh
amendment
problem?
