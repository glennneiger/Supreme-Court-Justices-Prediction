justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now,
the
attorney
on
the
other
side
says
that
the
rehabilitation
act
amendments
of
1986
make
clear
that
this
act
is
covered
at
least
after
1986.
would
you
agree
with
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
that's
why
i
ask
you
about
after
1986.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
could
be
viewed
as
that,
couldn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
this
was
designed
to
eliminate
discrimination
against
handicapped
children
in
schools
perhaps.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
suppose
we
were
to
agree
with
you,
that
at
least
as
to
the
claims
that
arose
before
1986
that
there
is
an
eleventh
amendment
bar
here.
you
raise
a
second
question
dealing
with
the
authority
of
the
secretary?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
did
not
challenge
the
lower
court's
ruling
that
lack
of
finality
and
delay
caused
by
the
remand
violated
federal
regulations,
did
you?
that's
not
challenged?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
what
that
means
is
that
the
third
circuit's
judgment
with
respect
to
the
tuition
reimbursement
board
award
would
stand
regardless
of
what
we
do
on
the
eleventh
amendment
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
would
stand
at
least
insofar
as
the
tuition
reimbursement
is
concerned.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
certainly
stands
as
against
the
school
district.
so,
how
do
we
ever
get
to
the
second
question
about
the
secretary?
i'm
not
sure
we
can.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
language
of
1415(b)
and
1415(c)
are
different.
isn't
that
right?
1415(c)
governing
appeals
does
not
explicitly
state--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
employees
of
the
state
agency
may
not
serve
as
review
officers.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
doesn't
say
that.
the
language
is
different.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
our
decision
in
burlington
addressed
whether
tuition
reimbursement
could
be
allowed,
and
indicated
that
it
could.
but
i
think
the
question
here
is
not
so
much
that
as
whether
the
state's
eleventh
amendment
immunity
has
been
abrogated.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
that
the
state
itself
could
be
held
liable
for
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
certainly
didn't
meet
the
kinds
of
requirements
that
atascadero
would
have
imposed,
did
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
guess
congress
enacted
the
means
whereby
it
could
enforce
its
requirement
on
states
that
they
spend
money.
they
can
withhold
financial
aid
if
states
don't
do
what
they're
required
to
do.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
there
are
enforcement
procedures
available
against
the
states
themselves
by
federal
action.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
presumably
prospective
relief.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
these--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--parents...
this
parent
will
get
reimbursement
regardless
of
our
holding?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
possible
that
the
rehab
act
amendments
of
'86
have
changed
the
rules--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
sure.
so
it
isn't
as
though
our
decision
here
is
going
to
determine
that
issue
necessarily.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
agree--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
the
rehab
act
amendments
of
1986
are
not
retroactive?
