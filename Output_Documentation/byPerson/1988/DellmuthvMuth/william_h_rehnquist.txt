we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
87-1855,
thomas
k.
gilhool
versus
russell
a.
muth.
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
a
statute
simply
outlawing
discrimination
against
handicapped
would
not
have
brought
in
its
wake
all
of
the
procedural
provisions
and
so
forth
of
the
eha,
which
really
requires
special
treatment
of
the
handicapped,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
parisi-vickers.
ms.
field,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
field,
it
isn't
certainly
phrased
in
terms
of
money
damages
either,
is
it?
i
mean,
i
think
ms.
vickers
made
the
point
that
until
our
burlington
decision
it
was
not
entirely
clear
that
you
could
get
an
award
for
tuition
reimbursement
even
against
a
school
district.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
agree,
do
you
not,
that
reimbursement
would
be
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment
if
congress
had
not
sought
to
abrogate
the
immunity?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
title
ix?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
does...
what
does
title
ix
prohibit
then?
it
prohibits
discrimination
on...
i
thought
on
the
part
of
people
who
received
federal
funds.
perhaps
i'm
wrong.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
don't
worry
about
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
mean
a
personal
financial...
but
his
agency
has
a
financial
interest?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
field.
ms.
parisi-vickers,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
the
case
is
submitted.
