ms.
maria
parisi-vickers
this
case
is
here
on
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
the
cases
arises
in
the
context
of
the
education
for
all
handicapped
children
act
of
1975.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
court
below
has
misunderstood
that
statute
when
it
held,
first,
that
it
abrogates
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity
of
the
states
from
suit
in
federal
court,
and,
second,
that
pennsylvania
secretary
of
education,
the
petitioner
here,
is
precluded
from
reviewing
administrative
appeals.
turning
to
the
first
issue,
we
believe
that
congress
has
not
abrogated
the
state's
constitutional
immunity.
in
atascadero
v.
scanlon
this
court
reaffirmed
the
concept
that
abrogation
of
eleventh
amendment
immunity
involves
a
fundamental
shift
in
the
constitutional
balance
between
the
states
and
the
federal
government
as
well
as
an
expansion
of
federal
constitutional
power
of
the
federal
courts.
consequently,
the
court
has
held
that
abrogation
of
immunity
will
not
be
found
unless
congressional
intent
to
subject
suits
to...
subject
states
to
federal
court
suits
is
unmistakably
clear.
this
clear
statement
rule
has
two
fundamental
and
important
reasons.
first
of
all,
it
is
intended
to
provide
notice
to
the
states
who,
as
in
the
eha,
have
voluntarily
agreed
to
participate
in
a
program
to
provide
equal
education
to
handicapped
children.
secondly,
it
makes
certain
that
congress
considers
directly
the
problems
and
issues
which
would
arise
if
states
are
subjected
to
suit
in
federal
court
and,
therefore,
lessens
the
chance
that
congress
will
act
in
haste
or
without
giving
consideration
to
the
constitutional
balance
which
it
will
be
affecting
with
its
actions.
it
is
our
position
that
this
notice,
which
is
required,
especially
to
the
states,
has
not
been
given
to
the
50
states
who
since
1975
have
joined
in
this
federal
government
partnership
to
provide
appropriate
education
for
every
handicapped
child
in
america.
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
struggled
to
find
this
clear
abrogation
language
and
in
doing
so
it
pointed
to
the
preamble
of
the
statute
found
at
section
140c(b)(9)
which
speaks
in
terms
of
the
federal
government's
intent
to
assist
the
states
in
providing
federal
funds
so
that
equal
education
can
be
achieved
for
handicapped
children.
that
is
at
page
6
of
our
petition
for
cert.--
it
also
points
to
section
1415(e)(2)...
page
11
of
our
petition
for
cert...
where
the...
there
is
a
provision
for
a
hearing,
a
due
process
hearing,
to
the
party
aggrieved
in
the
administrative
hearing
process,
and
a
party
so
aggrieved
will
have
the
right
to
bring
an
action
in
federal
court.
the
last
basis
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
stands
is
section
1415(e)(4)(g)
which
is
the
1986
amendment
to
the
act,
and
it
provides
for
attorney's
fees.
looking
at
these
provisions,
it
is
absolutely
clear
that
there
is
no
indication
at
all
that
states
were
to
be
made
liable
to
private
parties
under
the
eha.
no
state
liability
to
private
parties
is
mentioned.
the
abrogation
of
the
state's
immunity
is
nowhere
mentioned.
the
eleventh
amendment
is
nowhere
mentioned.
ms.
maria
parisi-vickers
not
at
all,
justice
o'connor,
for
two
reasons.
the
first
reason
is
dispositive.
and
that
is
that
that
amendment
is
effective
for
violations
occurring
after--
ms.
maria
parisi-vickers
--after
october
21,
1986
and,
therefore,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
particular
case
where
the
violations
occurred
long
before
that.
secondly,
as
we
discussed
in
our
brief,
the
eha
is
not
an
antidiscrimination
statute.
ms.
maria
parisi-vickers
certainly.
any
time
congress
enacts
a
law
which
will
provide
equal
distribution
of
benefits,
it
could
be
deemed
to
be
an
antidiscrimination
statute.
however,
these
are...
there
are
specific
statues,
those
enumerated,
and
there
are
other
statutes
which
specifically
are
designed
to
eliminate
discrimination
in
particular
areas.
there
are
entitlement
statues
usually.
ms.
maria
parisi-vickers
well,
this
is
actually...
you
could
view
this
as
a
discrimination
statute
because
it
focuses
particularly
on
one
group
and
gives
them
benefits
which
other
children
may
not
be
entitled
to,
or
other
groups
may
not
be
entitled
to.
for
those
reasons,
we
believe
that
it's
not
a
statute
which
can
be
lumped
into
the
category
of
antidiscrimination
statute,
and,
therefore,
the
rehabilitation
act
amendments
does
not
apply,
both
on
the
merits
and
as
to
the
applicable
date.
ms.
maria
parisi-vickers
that
is
correct.
ms.
maria
parisi-vickers
that
is
not.
and,
justice
o'connor,
we
address
that
concern
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief
where
we
pointed
out
that
there
is
a
decision
of
the
third
circuit.
the
third
circuit
affirmed
on
all
counts
the
district
court's
opinion
except--
ms.
maria
parisi-vickers
--for
the
attorney's
fees.
ms.
maria
parisi-vickers
that
is
not
so
because
there
is
an
attorney's
fee
award
which
depends
on
the
number
of
claims
which
mr.
muth
would
be
successful
on.
so
that
that--
ms.
maria
parisi-vickers
--as
to
the
amount...
assuming
that
the
eleventh
amendment
to
be--
ms.
maria
parisi-vickers
--well,
justice
o'connor,
we
do
have
an
order
of
the
third...
of
the
district
court
which
was
appealed
to
the
third
circuit
on
the
issue
of
attorney's
fees.
and
that
has
been
remanded.
the
attorney's
fees
issue
was
improperly
decided
by
the
district
court
and
there
is
a
remand
on
that.
and,
therefore,
in
deciding
the
issue
of
the
secretary
we
will
now
be
able
to
know
whether
or
not
the
commonwealth
has
prevailed
on
one
or
two
issues,
and
that
affects
the
attorney's
fees
determination.
going
back
to
the
examination
of
the
statute,
this
court
has
long
since
held,
at
least
since
1973,
that
merely
because
states
have
been
included
among
a
class
of
actors
is
not
enough
to
strip
them
of
their
sovereign
prerogative
of
immunity
from
suit.
and
an
award
of
attorney's
fees
in
an
amendment
such
as
the
1986
amendment
to
the
eha
is
not
sufficient
either.
in
addition,
the
third
circuit
used
the
language
of
the
statute
regarding
the
ability
of
the
federal
courts
to
grant
appropriate
relief
under
this
act
to
find
further
support
for
its
position
that
the
appropriate
relief
should
be
tuition
reimbursement.
we
note
parenthetically
that
it
took
a
decision
of
this
court
in
burlington
to
determine
that
tuition
was
an...
tuition
reimbursement
was
an
appropriate
relief
at
all
against
a
school
district.
and
in
that
case
there
was
no
eleventh
amendment
protection.
we
suggest
that
the
power
of
the
federal
courts
in
fashioning
appropriate
relief
is
constrained
by
eleventh
amendment
jurisprudence,
and
that
the
barrier
of
sovereign
immunity
was
not
removed
by
the
eha.
and
the
reason
that
it
was
not
removed
is
that
congress
did
not
need
to
do
so.
it
could
achieve
the
purposes
of
the
eha
by
providing
other
remedies,
remedies
which
it
included
in
the
statute
and
which
are
available
to
children
and
parents.
primary
among
those
remedies
is
the
fact
that
parents,
together
with
their
children,
participate
fully
at
every
stage
of
the
formulation
and
implementation
of
the
individualized
program
of
education
for
a
child.
if
they're
unhappy
with
that
program
of
education,
they
can
appeal
the
decision
of
the
school
district
to
an
administrative
hearing.
if
they're
unhappy
with
that,
there
is
a
judicial
remedy...
a
judicial
review
in
the
courts.
now,
once
in
the
courts
there
is
a
judicial
remedy
at
least
against
the
school
districts.
and
in
the
overwhelming
number
of
cases
the
tuition
reimbursement
remedy
will
be
available
to
litigants
because
the
school
districts
are
the
ones
which
are
usually
the
entitles
which
formulate
the
iep
and
are
in
dispute
with
the
parent.
therefore,
in
the
overwhelming
number
of
cases
there
will
be
a
tuition
reimbursement
under
the
act.
moreover,
if
there
is
an
ongoing
violation
of
federal
law,
state
of
official
can
be
enjoined.
so,
there
is
injunctive
relief
at
that
level.
ms.
maria
parisi-vickers
that
is
correct,
justice
scalla.
and--
ms.
maria
parisi-vickers
--no.
it
was
just
money
damages
and
the
attorney's
fees.
ms.
maria
parisi-vickers
that's
correct.
ms.
maria
parisi-vickers
the
validity
of
which
would
depend
in--
ms.
maria
parisi-vickers
--conceivably
there
could
be
attorney's
fees
for
the
violations...
the
procedural
violations
and
the
claim
which
plaintiff
did
prevail.
ms.
maria
parisi-vickers
if
the
court
found
that
the
money
damages...
money
damage
award
is
barred
because
of
the
eleventh
amendment
bar--
ms.
maria
parisi-vickers
--it
is
conceivable
that
it
could
find
an
ongoing
violation.
there
is
no
declaratory
relief
granted
in
this
case.
ms.
maria
parisi-vickers
i
believe
it
was,
but
it
was
not
granted.
ms.
maria
parisi-vickers
all
of
the
remedies
i
mentioned
are
further
buttressed
by
the
one
remaining
remedy,
which
is
it
money
damages
are
going
to
be
effective
against
the
state,
then
certainly
this
remedy
is
the
most
effective
one
of
all.
and
that
is,
the
financial
sanctions
which
the
united
states
secretary
of
education
can
impose
on
the
states
if
they
do
not
comply
with
the
state
plans
and
with
the
regulations
and
statute
of
the
eha.
and
that
sanction
is
found
at
16...
at
section
1416.
however,
the
goals
of
the
statute
must...
to
be
realized
must
in
the
end
rely
on
the
good
will
of
the
state
and
or
the
fact
that
the
states
have
agreed
to
voluntarily
participate
in
this
program.
they
have
chosen
to
join
with
congress
in
participating.
and
their
participation
is
a
substantial
commitment.
in
fact,
the
states
are
not
getting
a
free
ride
here
if
they
are
not
found
to
be
amenable
to
suit
in
federal
court
for
money
damages
by
an
individual
who
has
gone
through
the
process,
as
mr.
muth
has,
because
the
states
are...
the
entitles
which
provide
most
of
the
funding
for
education,
and
traditionally
it
has
been
so
and
i
think
this
court
can
take
judicial
notice
of
that
fact.
i
would
like
to
conclude
by
simply
stating
that
just
as
the
congress
abrogated
the
immunity
of
the
states
in
the
rehabilitation
act
amendment
of
1986,
it
could
have
done
so
just
as
easily
when
it
amended
the
eha
to
add
on
attorney's
fees.
congress
knows
how
to
abrogate
the
eleventh
amendment
in
unmistakably
clear
language
and
it
was
simply
not
done
so
here--
the
teachings
of
this
court
have
told
us
that
in
addressing
an
area
as
vital
to
our
system
of
government
as
the
states'
immunity,
the
constitution
requires
certainty.
not
inferences,
not
speculation.
and
i
think
that
that
is
what
the
third
circuit
has
engaged
in
in
arriving
at
its
holding.
congress
must
indicate
in
unequivocable
terms
in
the
statute
that
it
has
considered
deliberately
a
goal
that
it
sets
for
itself,
that
this
goal
so
transcends
the
constitutional
balance
between
the
federal
government
and
the
states
that
it
must
be
shifted
in
some
fashion.
there
is
no
evidence
here
whatsoever
that
the
shift
has
occurred
in
the
enactment
of
the
eha.
therefore,
the
court
of
appeals'
attempt
to
expand
its
jurisdiction
with
that
congressional
authority
should
be
rebutted.
ms.
maria
parisi-vickers
yes,
justice
stevens.
ms.
maria
parisi-vickers
that's
correct.
ms.
maria
parisi-vickers
no.
because
it's
a
statute
passed
pursuant
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
however,
not
all
statutes
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
are
antidiscrimination
statutes.
ms.
maria
parisi-vickers
section
2...
excuse
me,
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
is...
as
i
mentioned,
justice
stevens,
any
statute
where
government
is
distributing
benefits
and
attempting
to
do
so
in
a
rational
fashion...
any
statute
can
be
deemed
to
be
a
statute
which...
in
fact,
we
hope
that
all
statutes
enacted
by
legislatures
will
encourage
and
have
as
their
goal
the
equal
protection
of
the
rights
of
all
citizens.
however,
i
believe
that
the
antidiscrimination
statutes
are
peculiar
statutes
which
are
addressing
a
particular
evil
in
our
society
and
they
require...
they
do
not
require
the
type
of
affirmative
action
which
is
being...
which
is
found
in
the
eha.
but
they
require
distribution
in
an
equitable
fashion
of
funds
that
the
federal
government
is
giving
to
the
states.
i
think
they're
just
different
statutes.
ms.
maria
parisi-vickers
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
i
tried
to
say
that
by
saying...
when
i
said
that
in
fact
the
eha
is
a
discriminatory
statute
in
favor
of
the
handicapped
because
it
provides
so
many
more
procedures
than
what
students
would
be
entitled
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
ms.
maria
parisi-vickers
you
can,
but
the
congress
did
not
do
so.
we
did
not
say
that--
ms.
maria
parisi-vickers
--it
could.
it
has
the
power
to
do
so.
ms.
maria
parisi-vickers
all
right.
well,
i
think
it's...
it's
a
distinction
which
is
not...
comes
more
from
the
appellations
given
to
the
group
of
statutes,
rather
than
a
fundamental
difference.
there
are
statutes
which
are,
for
example,
age
discrimination
in
employment
statutes,
discrimination
in
housing.
there's
particular
statutes
which
give...
do
much...
do
less
than
the
eha
does.
the
eha
is
an
affirmative
program
which
goes
such
out
of
its
way...
it
comes
more
than
simply
establish
equality
in...
it
has
much
greater
goals
than
that.
that's
the
best
i
can
do,
mr....
justice--
ms.
maria
parisi-vickers
--the--
ms.
maria
parisi-vickers
--the
difficulty...
the
difficulty,
i
think
it's
one
of
nomenclature
and
not
substance.
i
think
that
the
antidiscrimination
statutes
have
the
same
goal
as
the
eha,
which
is
to
promote
equal
access
of
opportunities
for
children.
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
second
issue
on
which
certiorari
has
been
granted,
and
that
is
whether
the
eha
precludes
pennsylvania
secretary
of
education
from
reviewing
the
educational
due
process
hearings.
we
will
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
review
procedures
require
the
same
degree
of
impartiality
as
the
initial
hearing.
and,
consequently,
in
the
words
of
the
statute
at
1415(b)(2),
page
8
of
our
main
brief,
"no
hearing
shall
be
conducted
by
an
employee
of
such
agency
or
unit
involved
in
the
education
or
care
of
the
child.
"
this
is
the
standard
of
impartiality
which--
ms.
maria
parisi-vickers
--that's
correct.
ms.
maria
parisi-vickers
that's
correct.
ms.
maria
parisi-vickers
that's
is
correct.
for
purposes
of
this
argument,
we
have
conceded
that
the
interpretation
of
the
department...
u.s.
department
of
education,
that
the
level
of
impartiality
shall
be
the
same
as
what
we
will
adopt.
what
we
do
not
agree,
however,
is
that
the
department...
pennsylvania's
department
of
education
is
such
an
agency
or
unit
involved
in
the
education
or
care
of
the
child
because
the
department
is,
in
pennsylvania,
is
charged
with
the
generalized
supervision
of
education
over
501
school
districts...
it
is
the
school
districts
which
actually
teach
the
approximately
1.8
million
children
in
pennsylvania,
271,00
of
whom
are
special
education
children.
the
department
is
supervising.
it's
not
actually
teaching.
it
is
not
actually
promulgating
the
iep
or
not
getting
into
disputes
with
parents
over
the
individual
placement
of
a
child.
it
is
the
responsibility
of
the
department
to
enforce
the
regulations
promulgated
by
the
board
of
education
to
approve
curriculum,
to
establish
standards,
to
approve
school
district
plans
for
special
education
and
distribution
of
state
and
federal
funds
in
accordance
with
those
plans.
the
department
does
not
have
hands-on
teaching
responsibilities
for
the
child,
and
the
statute...
the
language
of
the
statute
says
education
of
the
child.
that
language
arises
in
the
context
of
an
iep
dispute,
dispute
for
individual
placement
of
a
child.
therefore,
it's
certainly
common
sense
to
conclude
that
the
department
is
not
involved
to
the
extent
that
the
statute
requires.
and,
therefore,
the
secretary,
who
is
the
head
of
that
agency,
would
be
a
suitable
review
officer.
theoretically,
of
course,
the
department
is
involves
in
the
care
of
every
child...
education
and
care
of
every
child
in
pennsylvania.
but
the
department
is
not
a
party
to
these
disputes.
it
is
the
school
district
which
is
involved
with
the
parent.
from
a
common
sense
approach,
if
we
asked
the
parent
who
is
involved
in
the
care
of
your
child,
you're
going
to
hear
that
it's
a
teacher
or
a
principal,
perhaps
the
school
district.
neither
common
sense
nor
traditional
concepts
of
administrative
law
preclude
the
department
from
reviewing
these
administrative
appeals.
in
fact,
in
the
eha
the
department
of
education
is
the
pivotal
player
answering
to
the
federal
government
in
its
supervision
of
the
state
plan
as
it
is
implemented
by
the
school
districts.
and,
therefore,
it
has
responsibility
both
to
the
federal
government
and
supervisory
responsibilities
over
the
school
districts.
the
secretary
of
education
in
pennsylvania
has
the
same
powers
of
financial
sanctions
over
the
school
districts
for
failure
to
comply
with
state
plans,
than
the
united
states
secretary
of
education
has
over
the
state.
certainly,
we
cannot
conclude
from
this
statutory
framework
that
the
secretary
of
education
in
pennsylvania
and
the
school
districts
will
be
on
the
same
side
or
have
any
particular
sympathy
for
each
other
when
it
comes
to
deciding
an
individual
child's
placement.
moreover,
the
participation
of
the
secretary
is
salutary
for
the
goals
of
the
eha.
when
the
secretary
of
education
participates
in
the
review
process,
he
learns
how
the
policies
which
he
may
have
implemented,
the
regulations
promulgated
by
the
department,
the
board
of
education...
how
they
actually
affect
an
individual
case.
and
so
he
can
learn.
if
a
policy
is
challenged,
even
if
it's
a
policy
that
he
himself
makes...
has
made...
this
is
an
opportunity
for
him
to
rethink,
reexamine
the
challenge
and
come
to
an
appropriate
decision.
we
submit
that
the
secretary
of
education,
bound
as
he
is
to
observe
the
law,
and
as
explained
by
this
court
and
by
the
courts
of
the
state,
will
not
ignore
those
laws.
we
urge,
therefore,
for
this
court
to
find
that
the
secretary
is
an
impartial
decision
maker
because
the
agency
which
he
heads
is
not
involved
in
the
education
and
care
of
the
child.
and,
moreover,
because
clearly
as
a
constitutional
officer
appointed
by
the
governor
he
is
not
an
employee
of
the
agency.
thank
you
very
much.

rebuttal.
