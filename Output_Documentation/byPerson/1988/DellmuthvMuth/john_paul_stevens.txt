justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
just
ask
one
question?
do
you
concede
that
the
education
for
all
handicapped
children
act
is
a
statute
with
respect
to
which
congress
could
abrogate
the
states'
eleventh
amendment
immunity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
because
it's
a
statute
that
the
congress
has
special
power
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
deal
with?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
that
because
it's
an
antidiscrimination
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
part
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
authorized
this
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
you
one
question?
if
you
lose
on
your
statutory
argument,
have
you
abandoned
point
1
in
your
brief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
court
should
overturn
hans
against
louisiana.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
no
longer
subscribe
to
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--composition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
haven't
argued
it
very
vigorously.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
did
you
argue
it
then
in
the
brief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
wonder
if
you're
acting
as
an
academic
or
an
advocate
on
that
part
of
your
brief.
