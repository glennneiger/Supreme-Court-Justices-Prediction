ms.
martha
a.
field
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
don't
think
you
need
to
reach
the
partiality
issue
in
this
case,
and
for
that
reason
i
think
i'm
going
to
put
off
talking
about
it
until
the
end
of
my
argument.
just
to
say
why
i
don't
think
you
need
to
reach
it,
as
justice
o'connor
said,
the
remand
violation
which
is
established
is
sufficient
to
support
the
reimbursement.
and
i
really
don't
think
that
a
rule
that
attorney's
fees
depend
on
the
percentage
of
success
of
the
attorney
below
means
that
this
court
has
to
hear
questions
that
are
otherwise
irrelevant
to
the
case.
this
case
is
of
central
importance
to
children
with
handicaps
and
their
parents.
it
used
to
be
that
parents
whose
children
were
born
with
handicaps
sometimes
had
to
give
up
their
parental
rights
or
even
institutionalize
their
child
in
order
to
obtain
necessary
education
or
medical
treatment.
in
1975
in
enacting
the
education
for
all
handicapped
children
act,
congress
opted
instead
to
allow
parents
to
participate
fully
in
decisions
concerning
the
education
of
their
child.
mr.
muth,
the
respondent,
exercised
that
right
when
after
three
and
a
half
years
of
attempting
to
obtain
an
appropriate
education
from
the
school
district
he
decided
instead
to
place
his
child
in
a
school
which
specializes
in
language
disabilities,
a
school
at
which
his
son
alex
in
fact
made
substantial
progress.
when
muth
took
this
step,
school
authorities
were
not
offering
an
appropriate
education,
as
the
hearing
officer
subsequently
held.
the
remedy
of
reimbursement
in
appropriate
cases
is
necessary
in
order
to
allow
parents
to
participate
effectively
because
otherwise
parents
would
have
to
accept
whatever
education
school
officials
offered
them
during
the
period
of
administrative
review.
that
period
can
be
a
significant
one.
in
this
case,
the
period
of
administrative
decisionmaking
took
more
than
a
year.
alex
needed
an
education
during
that
year.
the
development
of
handicapped
children
cannot
be
shifted
to
told
while
the
decisionmaking
process
unwinds.
a
year
in
an
inappropriate
education
or
without
necessary
services
can
be
a
devastating
experience
to
any
child,
and
handicapped
children--
ms.
martha
a.
field
--that's
right.
ms.
martha
a.
field
that's
right.
this
court
has
unanimously
recognized
that
tuition
reimbursement
is
important
to
the
functioning
of
the
eha.
i'd
really
like
to
make
two
points
about
that.
one
is
that
even
though,
as
mrs.
vickers
said,
the
school
districts
are
often
available
as
defendants
in
these
cases,
that
is
not
in
any
event
invariably
so.
and
so
it's
important
that
the
same
rule
as
to
the
availability
of
tuition
reimbursement
be...
be
applied
against
states
as
defendants.
and
i
also
would
like
to
show
you
that
the
education
of
the
handicapped
act
in
1975
did
expressly
waive
states'
immunity.
ms.
martha
a.
field
well,
we
think
it
did.
if
atascadero
is
read
to
require
some
particular
formula
of
words,
congress
acting
ten
years
before
atascadero
did
not
use
any
particular
formula
of
words
which
it
could
not
have
anticipated.
but,
in
fact,
the
language
of
the
1975
eha
does
constitute
a
clear
statement
that
congress
intends
to
waive
states'
immunity.
and
it's
much
clearer
than
the
statute
involved
in
atascadero
was.
indeed,
it's
also
clearer
than
title
vii,
which
this
court
unanimously
held
in
fitzpatrick
v.
bitzer...
did
clearly
and
effectively
abrogate
states'
immunity.
in
atascadero,
just
to
make
that
comparison,
the
rehabilitation
act
provision
at
issue
said
that
any
recipient
of
federal
assistance
should
be
liable.
that
phrase,
"any
recipient
of
federal
assistance"
did
literally
include
states.
it
also,
however,
included
many
thousands
of
private
companies.
the
statute
involved
in
atascadero
did
not
mention
states.
the
eha,
the
1975
eha,
by
contrast,
mentions
states
more
than
50
times.
more
important
than
that,
the
only
possible
defendants
under
the
eha
are
states,
and
the
school
districts
which
they
set
up,
control,
and
supervise.
as
the
petitioner
itself
stresses,
under
the
eha
states
are
the
only
parties
with
ultimate
responsibility
for
seeing
that
every
child
receives
an
appropriate
education.
in
these
circumstances,
every
member
of
congress
had
to
have
been
aware
in
enacting
the
eha
that
its
remedies
would
be
enforceable
against
the
states.
the
language
of
the
eha...
we're
not
relying
on
the
legislative
history,
but
the
language
of
the
statute
itself...
carries
clear
and
unmistakable
notice.
this
is
the
key
fact
that
separates
this
case
from
atascadero.
the
specific
language
that
is
helpful
is
not
only
the
section
1400
which
mrs.
vickers
read
from,
but
there
are
clear
provisions
in
section
1412
particularly,
but
also
elsewhere
in
the
statute,
imposing
duties
upon
the
states,
recognizing
that
states
are
the
responsible
party...
indeed,
are
the
only
ultimately
responsible
party,
and
recognizing
that
states
will
directly
provide
the
education
in
a
good
many
situations.
and
after
that,
section
1415
expressly
gives
parents
the
opportunity
to
present
a
complaint
with
respect
to
any
matter
in
a
due
process
hearing
with
judicial
review
in
state
or
federal
court...
this
is
by
the
parent
against
the
state...
for
any
appropriate
relief.
so,
there
is
clear
language,
although
it
may
not
be
phrased
exactly
the
way
that
congress--
ms.
martha
a.
field
--yes.
it's
not...
it's
phrased
in
terms
of
appropriate
relief.
i
think
congress
really
rather
wisely
didn't
spell
out
the
bounds
of
appropriate
relief
in
the
statute.
one
thing
that
is
clear
is
that
under
the
eha
many
varied
situations
can
arise.
for
example,
your
case
last
year
in
honig
v.
doe
that
congress
could
not
possibly
have
anticipated.
and
courts,
by
devising
appropriate
relief
and
molding
it
to
the
facts
of
each
particular
case,
can
come
up
with
more
appropriate
remedies
than
congress
could
have
thought
about
in
1975.
as
this
court
said
in
burlington,
appropriate
relief
does
include
reimbursement.
we're
not
arguing
that
it
includes
money
damages.
it's
not
clear
whether
or
not
it
includes
money
damages,
though
most
lower
courts
have
said
in
some
situations
it
does.
but
it's
not
necessary
in
this
case
to
find
that
appropriate
relief
includes
damages,
but
only
reimbursement.
and
i
believe
in
burlington
this
court
drew
the
distinction
between
reimbursement
and
damages
saying
at
least
reimbursement
was
available
under
the
eha.
ms.
martha
a.
field
that's...
that's
correct.
what...
what
we
are
saying...
we're
certainly
not
asking
you
to
alter
edelman
v.
jordan,
but
we're
simply
saying
that
appropriate
relief
within
the
eha
includes
reimbursement.
one
thing
that
is
clear
from
the
history
of
the
eha,
both
in
1975
and
again
in
the
1986
amendments,
is
congress
knew
that
in
imposing
this
obligation
upon
the
states
that
they
were
requiring
states
to
spend
money.
that...
that
was
absolutely
clear.
and,
indeed,
the
main...
the
main
relevance
of
the
1986
eha
amendments
here
which
are
not
directly
relevant
because
they
concerned
only
attorney's
fees...
but
they
again
showed
that
congress
was
willing
to
require
states
to
spend
money
to
achieve
appropriate
education.
the
reason
is
that
a
though
special
education
is
expensive,
it
really
is
highly
cost-effective
and...
for
many...
for
many
of
the
persons
who
receive
special
education
under
the
eha,
it
makes
the
difference
whether
they
can
function
as
productive
and
law-abiding
citizens.
so,
i
think
this...
this
is
the
attitude
which
caused
congress
to
make
the
judgement
that
states
should
spend
money
for
appropriate
education
if
they
opted
to
be
included
in
this
eha
program.
ms.
martha
a.
field
well,
they
can
withhold
financial
aid.
ms.
martha
a.
field
well,
that
enforcement
procedure
is
available
and
prospective
relief
would
be
available.
ms.
martha
a.
field
yes.
this
court
in
burlington
held
that
prospective
relief
and
the
withholding
of
federal
funds
was
not
a
sufficient
remedy.
and,
really,
the
remedy
of
withholding
federal
funds
is
patently
not
a
remedy
that
will
secure
appropriate
education
in
every
child's
case.
one
problem,
of
course,
is
that
withholding
funds
removes
education,
it
doesn't
provide
it.
but
even
more
than
that,
funds
will
not
be
withhold
because...
because
of
individual
violations.
indeed,
section
1416
says
that
states
should...
that
funds
should
be
withheld
only
if
states
are
substantially
out
of
compliance
with
the...
with
the
statue.
the
point
of
the
eha,
by
contrast,
is
to
provide
an
appropriate
education
in
every
child's
case.
and
the
point
of
the
reimbursement
remedy
is
to
empower
parents,
who
otherwise
would
have
to
accept
whatever
education
school
authorities
offered
them,
to
have
their
perspective
reflected
in
the
educational
plan
which
is
ultimately
adopted--
ms.
martha
a.
field
--in
each
case.
ms.
martha
a.
field
that's
right.
this
parent
will
get
reimbursement
from
the
school
district
because
the
school
district
did
not
seek
certiorari.
and
i
think
it's
for
that
reason
that
the
attorney's
fees
of
the
lawyer
who
represented
mr.
muth
in
district
court
several
years
ago
would
not
be
reduced
or
would
not...
would
not
disappear
regardless
of
what
this...
regardless
of
what
this
court
does.
i
also
think
his
attorney's
fees
would
not
be
affected
by...
any
ruling
on
partiality.
even
though
the
school
district
is
available
in
this
case
to
pay...
to
pay
tuition
reimbursement
and
will
be
regardless
of
what
this
court
holds,
it
is
important
to
a
proper
construction
of
the
eha
that
it
also
be
recognized
that
the
state
is
liable
for
reimbursement.
the
petitioner's
interpretation,
saying
that
school
districts
can
be
held
liable
but
not
states,
would
leave
many
handicapped
children
with
no
possibility
of
a
reimbursement
remedy,
and,
accordingly,
no
possibility
of
effective
parental
participation.
many
children
do
receive
education
directly
from
the
state.
indeed,
some
of
the
children
who
receive
education
directly
from
the
state
are
the
most
severely
handicapped
children,
which
the
eha
is...
gives
priority
to.
the...
the
statute
shows
that
there
is
an
important
policy
that
the
most
severely
handicapped
not
be
omitted
from
the...
from
the
program.
not
only
would
the
children
which...
who
were
250,000
last
year
would
receive
education
directly
from
the
state
lose
their
right
to
tuition
reimbursement,
but
also,
when
appropriate
education
is
denied
because
of
reasons
having
to
do
with
state
policy
or
even
state
procedural
violations,
it
would
not
be
appropriate
in
those
cases
for
the
school
districts
to
be
held
liable
for
tuition
reimbursement.
that
is
the
type
of
issue
that
is
involved
in
a
good
many
of
these
cases.
the
challenges
are
sometimes
to
state
statutes,
state
policies,
state
procedures,
as
in
this
situation.
and
the
state,
in
that
situation,
is
the
only
appropriate
defendant.
ms.
martha
a.
field
for--
ms.
martha
a.
field
--the
future.
ms.
martha
a.
field
no.
your
decision
here
would
determine
that
issue
if
a
different
construction
were
given
to
the
rehabilitation
act,
as
the
state
has
contended
for.
and
it
also
would
determine
that
issue
in
the
handful
of
cases
that
exist
where
the
eha
is
the
only
statute
that
can
be...
that
can
be
relied
on.
it
also
is
relevant,
i
think,
that
even
when
a
school
district
is
a
defendant
that
the
remedy
be
able
to
run
against
the
state
because
school
districts
can
be
set
up
in
such
a
way
that
they
are
an
arm
of
the
state
for
eleventh
amendment
purposes,
the
intermediate
units
in
pennsylvania,
for
example,
which
are
sometimes
the
defendants
in
these
cases
rather
than
the
local
school
districts
it
the
types
of
services
that
the
dispute
is
about
are
services
that
are
handled
by
the
intermediate
unit...
the
intermediate
units
have
been
held
to
be
arms
of
the
state
for
eleventh
amendment
purposes.
so,
even
though
in
those
situations
one
would
not
be
suing
the
state
and
it
would
be
a
local
school
district
within
the
meaning
of
the
eha,
any
immunity
that
the
state
had
from
tuition
reimbursement
would
be
shared
by
those
defendants.
and
there--
ms.
martha
a.
field
--are
other--
ms.
martha
a.
field
--we
agree
that
the
rehabilitation
act
amendments
are
not
retroactive.
we
thought
that
it
was...
that
it
could
be
relevant
to
your
consideration
that
this
issue
is
taken
care
of
for
the
future.
we
now
find
that
there
is
not
total
agreement,
that
it
is
taken
care
of
for
the
future.
and
i
do
think
that
the
phrase
in
the
rehabilitation
act
which
refers
to
all
other
federal
recipients
of...
all
other
federal
recipients
of
financial
assistance
does
include
the
eha.
i
think
also
the
suggestion
in
the
petitioner's
brief
that
this
opens
some
sort
of
pandora's
box
is
not
to
be
taken
seriously.
we
looked
as
far
as
we
could
for
statutes
that
prohibited
discrimination
by
recipients
of
federal
financial
assistance
and
the
only
statute
we
could
find
that
met
that
description
was
the
eha
because--
ms.
martha
a.
field
--i
believe
title
ix's
nondiscrimination
duty
is
not
phrased
in
terms
of
recipients
of
federal
financial
assistance.
there
are
many
other
statutes
that
impose
a
duty
not
to
discriminate.
but
the
duty
not
to
discriminate
is
usually
not
imposed
in
terms
of
recipients
of
federal
financial
assistance,
but...
but
in
some
other
term.
ms.
martha
a.
field
i'm
afraid
i
don't
have
that...
that--
ms.
martha
a.
field
--information.
so
that
we
believe
that
the
rehabilitation
act
amendments
would
take
care
of
this
for
the
future,
but
that
the
eha
imposes
a
duty
of...
abrogates
states'
immunity
under
the
1975
act,
which
is
what
applies
to
this
case.
and
because
many...
because
many
students
will
be...
or,
many
handicapped
children
will
be
subject
only
to
the
possibility
of
actions
against
the
state
and
not
entities
which
are
local
for
purposes
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
that
it
is
necessary
to
fulfill
the
purposes
of
the
eha
as
well
as
to
satisfy
its
clear
language,
that
the
burlington
holding
that
school
districts
are
liable
be
applied
also
to
states
as
defendants.
we
do
think
that
it
would
create
several
unfortunate
consequences
if
the
anti-reimbursement
position
were
adopted.
one,
there
would
be
an
extremely
unfortunate
procedural
consequence
in
those
situations
where
the
state
is
the
responsible
party
because
parents
would
have
to
then
bypass
the
administrative
procedure
altogether
and
go
directly
to
district
court
to
obtain
preliminary
injunctive
relief
if
reimbursement
were
not
available.
that
would
be
the
only
avenue
available
to
parents
to
obtain
the
appropriate
placement
at
public
expense,
which
the
statute...
which
the
statute
offers
them.
so,
that
would
be
one
way
in
which
the
system
just
wouldn't
work
well
if
states
were
removed
as
possible
defendants
in
these
actions.
ms.
martha
a.
field
that--
ms.
martha
a.
field
--certainly
is--
ms.
martha
a.
field
--correct--
ms.
martha
a.
field
--if
you
accept
our
construction
of
the
'86
act--
ms.
martha
a.
field
--which
i
hope
that
you
will.
ms.
martha
a.
field
that's
right.
and
there
are
a
substantial
number...
number
of
cases
where
preliminary
injunctive
relief
is
sought
even
now.
so
that...
but
this
would
make
it
the
only
possible
avenue,
once
it
was
known
that
states
were
no
longer--
ms.
martha
a.
field
--it's
clear...
if
there
is
a
irreparable
harm.
and
what
the
holding
would
do
is
make
it
absolutely
clear
that
there
would
be
irreparable
harm.
the
other
disadvantage
of
the
anti-reimbursement
position
is,
of
course,
that
it
would
leave
parents
and
children
without
any
effective
means
to
obtain
appropriate
education
during
the
period
of
review.
and
it
would
create
incentives
for
school
districts
to
delay
in
meeting
their
obligations
when
the
placement
sought
was
an
expensive
one.
children,
then,
would
lose
their
right
to
education
for
as
long
as
the
decisionmaking
process
continued.
because
we
think
there
is
a
clear
statement
in
the
eha,
it
would
be
appropriate
for
this
court
to
uphold
mr.
muth's
tuition
reimbursement
award
for
1983
to
'84.
and
the
court
really
need
not
decide
any
more.
however,
the
court
either
alternatively
or
additionally
could
rest
affirmance
on
the
ground
that
the
courts
below
relied
on,
and
that
is
the
substantial
procedural
violations
in
the
administrative
process
that
was
employed
in
this
case.
the
act
has
rather
strict
time
limitations,
either
45
days
or
75
days,
depending
which
review
scheme
the
state
chooses
to
follow.
in
this
case,
the
administrative
process
because
of
illegalities
dragged
out
for
more
than
a
year
longer
than
the
strict
time
limitations
in
the
act
allowed.
mr.
muth
suffered
serious
harm
as
a
result
of
that,
as
the
court
below
found.
for
that
reason
we
really
are
not
talking
about
punitive
damages.
we
don't
think
punitive
damages
would
be
appropriate
relief
under
the
eha.
we
think
we
are
talking
neither
about
damages
nor
about
something
that
was
punitive.
and
so
it
would
be
appropriate
for
this
court
to
uphold
the
reimbursement
award
on
that
ground.
even
if
you
uphold
it
on
that
ground,
it's
not
necessary
to
reach
the
partiality
matter
on
which
the...
on
which
the
state
sought
certiorari
because
the
remand
fully...
fully
justifies
the
reimbursement
of
remedy.
ms.
martha
a.
field
that
ground
is
affected
by
the
eleventh
amendment
problem.
that
is...
there
is
no
reimbursement
available
against
the
state
unless
you
find
that
the
eha
provides
a
clear
statement.
so,
that...
that
really
is
the
crucial...
the
crucial
decision
in
this
case.
if
you
find
that
there
is
abrogation,
then
mr.
muth
is
entitled
to
reimbursement
on
either
of
two
grounds.
one,
the
school
district
did
not
provide
an
appropriate
education
during
the
1983
to
'84
school
year.
there
has
been
some
attempt
to
create
some
factual
disputes
around
whether
an
appropriate
education
was
provided,
but
we're
really
quite
happy
with
the
statements
of
facts
as
it
appears
in
the
petitioner's
brief
on
page
14.
they
mention
that
the
school
district
at
the
outset
of
the
year
came
in
with
a
plan
for
education
which
the
hearing
officer
held
was
inappropriate.
not
necessarily
inappropriate
in
its
placement
but
inappropriate
in
the
services
that
were
offered
to
the
child.
the
school
district
at
that
point
wrote
mr.
muth
a
letter
saying
that
they
would
not
offer
those
services
until
the
administrative
review
was
final.
and
the
school
district
appealed
from
the
award
for
those
services,
saying
that
it...
saying
that
it
really
wasn't
necessary
for
them
to
provide
those
services
to
the
child
at
all.
it
wasn't
until
april
of
1984...
when
the
school
year
in
question
here
is
1983
to
1984...
in
april
of
1984
the
school
district
came
up
with
an
appropriate
education
plan.
a
plan
that
was
subsequently
in
july
of
'84
held
to
have
been
appropriate
for
the
'83-84
school
year
if
it
had
been
put
into
effect.
but
we
don't
think
that
the
fact
that
on
april
26th
of
the
1983-84
school
year
the
school
district
then
came
up
with
an
appropriate
education
plan
should
mean
that
during
1983
to
1984
it
was
all
right
to
leave
alex
without
any
appropriate
education.
ms.
martha
a.
field
so
i
think
the--
ms.
martha
a.
field
--which
is
point
1?
the
burlington
ground?
ms.
martha
a.
field
oh.
ms.
martha
a.
field
no,
i
do.
ms.
martha
a.
field
i
do.
i
do
subscribe
to
that.
there--
ms.
martha
a.
field
--it...
well,
it's
not
clear
to
me
that
if
we
lost
on
the
clear
statement
ground,
that
the
overturning
of
hans
by
itself
would
make
all...
all
the
difference.
ms.
martha
a.
field
we
argued
it
because
i
think
it
is
relevant
to
your
decision,
whether
you
view
hans
v.
louisiana
as...
or,
whether
you
view
sovereign
immunity
as
a
constitutionally
based
doctrine
or
a
doctrine
that
flows
from
something
else.
ms.
martha
a.
field
well,
i'm
acting
as
a
little
bit
of
both.
but...
but
i
think
it's...
well,
an
analogy
could
be
made
to
erie
railroad
v.
thompkins
in
which
the
decision
that
the
court
made
didn't
change
the
results
of
the
case.
but
the
only
thing
inappropriate
about
the
court
deciding
that
issue
was
that
the
parties
hadn't
raised
and
argued
it.
i
think
it's
an
important
issue
of
eleventh
amendment
jurisprudence
which
could
affect
the
outcome
of
this
case,
but
would
not
necessarily
affect
the...
affect
the
outcome
of
this
case.
perhaps
i'll
take
a
moment
to
talk
about
the
partiality
issue
in
case
you
do
reach
it.
if
you
do,
we
think
we...
we
hope
that
you
would
hold,
as
other
courts
have,
that
the
eha,
unlike
the
conventional
administrative
scheme,
does
not
permit
the
head
of
the
agency
to
be
the
final
administrative
decisionmaker.
instead
of
relying
on
general
principles
of
administrative
law
in
enacting
the
eha,
the
eha
created
its
own
procedural
scheme,
which
is
really
at
the
heart
of
the
act.
there's
very
little
in
the
way
of
substantive
requirements
in
the
eha.
no
definition
of
appropriate
education,
for
example.
but
the
procedural
scheme
is
at
the
heart
of
the
act.
one
reason
that
the
secretary
should
be
eliminated
as
the
reviewing
officer,
as
the
court
below
held,
is
that
he
has
a
clear
financial
interest
in
the
outcome
of
the
dispute.
in
this
case,
for
example,
if
alex
had
been
given
the
placement
that
he
sought,
under
pennsylvania
law
the
tuition
would
have
then
come
out
of
the
state
agency's
budget.
on
the
other
hard
if
alex--
ms.
martha
a.
field
--that's
right.
that
right.
if...
if,
on
the
other
hand,
alex
lost,
the
local
school
district
would
be
responsible
for
the
tuition.
so,
there's
that
kind
of
financial
involvement
on
the
part
of
the
secretary
of
education.
moreover,
as
a
policymaker,
the
secretary
has
a
clear
conflict
of
interest
under
the
act.
the
petitioner
wants
to
use
due
process
hearings
in
order
to
make
policy.
that's
really
its
argument.
but
the
eha
does
not
permit
policy
to
be
made
in
this
fashion.
instead,
the
due
process
hearing
is
supposed
to
be
a
neutral
unbiased
determination
on
the
facts
of
the
particular
case,
depending
on
the
programs
offered
and
the
facts
concerning
the
needs
of
the
particular
child
as
to
what
the
appropriate
education
is.
thank
you.
