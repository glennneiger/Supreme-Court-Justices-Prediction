justice
white
well,
they
did
order
a
refund,
did
they
not?
justice
white
so
if
there
was
more...
if
it
was
retroactive
beyond
that,
there
would
be
a
refund?
justice
white
exactly,--
justice
white
--let
me--
--it
may
be
around
in
the
next
case.
justice
white
what
if
it
were
proven
that...
what
if
the
court
just
said,
well,
you
may
be
entitled
to
a
refund
if
you
have
really
been
hurt,
but
we
hold
that
you
have
passed
on
every
dollar
worth
of
this
tax?
justice
white
but
you
say
that
you
are
only
asking
for
the
return
of
a...
you
only
want
to
be
treated
fairly.
justice
white
and
you
want
to...
but
if
you
have
never
been
hurt
by
this
tax,
if
all
you
have
done
is
passed
it
on
to
your
customers,
why
should
you
get
a
refund?
justice
white
you
want
your
refund,
and
to
get
a
refund
you
are
going
to
have
to
prove
competitive
injury,
and
recover
only
what
the
competitive
injury
was?
justice
white
you
assume
that
you
are
talking
about
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
when
as
i
understand
it,
the
request
is
only
not
to
refund
all
the
taxes
that
were
paid,
but
only
to
be
made
whole,
only
to
be
put
in
an
equal
position?
justice
white
of
course,
that
is
such
a
horrible
example,
perhaps,
because
it
is
not
unlawful
to
provide
the
exemption
for
the
clergymen.
i
mean,
if
you
pick
some
law
that
all
the
states
have
thought
to
be
okay,
and
that
maybe
is
okay...
i
was
dissenting,
after
all,
in
texas
monthly--
justice
white
on
what
basis
did
they
get
a
refund
after
the
date
of
justice
blackmon's
order?
justice
white
i
know.
the
money
is
in
escrow,
but
you
have
to
have
some
right
to
it.
justice
white
there
is
a
state
law
remedy?
justice
white
for
a
refund?
justice
white
--what
is
this
argument
addressed
to?
justice
white
do
you
think
they
would
have
been
do
you
think
that
they
would
have
been
entitled
to
a
refund
back
to
the
date
of
scheiner
if
instead
of
remanding,
we
had
summarily
reversed?
justice
white
but
if
it
continued
to
collect
the
tax
without
an
escrow,
you
would
say
no
refund?
justice
white
well,
that
was
reversed,
that
is
all.
justice
white
well,
the
state
taxing
people
just
continue
to
collect
the
tax.
justice
white
do
you
think
it
is
irrelevant
to
the
refund
question
as
to
whether
or
not
any
fool
should
have
known
after
scheiner
that
this
tax
was
un-constitutional?
justice
white
we
are
not
talking
about
back
to
1983.
i
am
just
talking
about
back
to
the
date
of
scheiner.
justice
white
prospective
to
when?
from
what?
justice
white
do
you
say
that
retroactivity
should
go
clear
back
to
1983?
justice
white
because
it
was
predictable,
is
that
it?
justice
white
anybody
should
have
known
that
it
was
un-constitutional?
justice
white
oh,
i
see.
justice
white
even
though,
even
though
there
were
cases
on
the
books
that
were
against
it
that
had
not
been
overruled?
justice
white
yes.
