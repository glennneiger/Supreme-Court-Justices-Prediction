justice
kennedy
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
is
not
only
retroactivity,
but
assuming
that
the
tax
is
retroactively
stricken,
what
the
remedy
is.
justice
kennedy
and
is
that
a
statutory
refund
procedure?
justice
kennedy
well,
does
the
state
court
have
any
latitude
in
determining
how
retroactivity
is
affected?
that
is
to
say,
if
in
a
case
it
said
all
the
tax
was
passed
on,
and
this
particular
taxpayer
has
not
had
any
loss,
does
that
affect
retroactivity
so
that
state
issues
are
bound
up
with
what
you
are
going
to
begin
talking
to
us
about?
justice
kennedy
well,
suppose
we
have
a
state
remedial
scheme
that
is
evenhandedly
applied,
and
it
operates
as
a
matter
of
state
law
to
deny
you
recovery
in
this
case?
justice
kennedy
so
you
have
an
interest
other
than
simply
being
treated
equally
with
florida
taxpayers
under
florida
law?
justice
kennedy
now,
suppose
they
did
not,
and
they
just
continued
passing
statutes
which
had
tiny
variations
from
the
first,
but
continued
essentially
an
unlawful
exemption
scheme
in
place?
justice
kennedy
which
is
what
happened
here.
justice
kennedy
cannot
a
state
enjoin
the
collection
of
a
tax
prospectively
if
it
sees
this
differential?
justice
kennedy
well,
does
that
not
give
the
same
windfall?
justice
kennedy
if
that
is
now
the
injunction
read.
