chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
no.
88-192,
mckesson
corporation
v.
division
of
alcoholic
beverages
of
florida,
consolidated
with
no.
88-325,
american
trucking
associations
v.
maurice
smith.
mr.
frey,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
did
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
pretermit
all
other
issues
except
whether
or
not
this
was...
compiled
with
the
chevron
tax?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
cannot
pay
under
protest?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
are
you
claiming
that
your
clients
did
not
have
to
pay
it,
or
should
pay
no
tax
to
arkansas?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
i
mean,
during
this
period
of
time
when
you
were
running
trucks
on
the
arkansas
highways
do
you
concede
that
you
are
liable
for
some
sort
of
tax?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
robertson,
and
you
are
representing
the
petitioner
mckesson
corporation,
are
you
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you
are
saying
in
effect
that
you
are
getting
damages
for
competitive
injury,
which
could
be
totally
different
than
the
amount
of
the
tax
paid,
i
would
think.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you
are
saying
that
you...
because
you
have
competitive
injury,
you
are
entitled
to
the
tax
refund,
even
though
you
may
have
completely
passed
the
tax
along?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
think
that
you
have
answered
the
question.
thank
you,
mr.
robertson.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
farr.
mr.
farr,
you
are
representing
the
state
of
florida,
right?
chief
justice
rehnquist
florida
producers
were
operating
at
an
advantage
during
that
time,
as
compared
to
mckesson?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
is
within
the
federal
system,
really.
we
do
not
extent
that
principle
to
state
courts.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
are
correct.
mr.
randolph?
you
are
representing
arkansas.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
if
that
though
is
reflection
on
the
arkansas
taxing
authorities...
perhaps
more
could
have
been
exacted
it
more
had
been
exacted
from
arkansas
truckers
too.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
randolph.
mr.
frey,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
frey,
your
time
has
expired.
the
case
is
submitted.
