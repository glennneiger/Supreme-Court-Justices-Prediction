mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
think
the
best
way
to
see
why
mckesson
is
not
entitled
to
a
tax
refund
in
this
case
is
to
look
at
the
injunction
issued
by
the
state
courts,
and
to
ask
what
tax
mckesson
would
have
paid
if
that
injunction
had
been
issued
the
day
before
the
tax
took
effect.
as
the
court
is
aware,
the
injunction
effectively
denied
tax
preferences
which
had
been
in
the
statute
for
sales
of
a
small
group
of
alcoholic
beverages,
striking
the
preferences
from
the
statute.
no
one
questions
that
this
was
the
right,
remedy,
the
right
way
to
make
the
statute
constitutional.
if
that
same
injunction
had
been
issued
on
june
30,
1985,
which
is
the
day
before
the
effective
date
of
the
1985
statute,
mckesson
would
not
have
paid
one
penny
less
in
taxes.
given
that
fact,
it
was
entirely
reasonable
for
the
florida
state
court
to
say
that
it
was
inappropriate
to
force
a
refund
that
would
have
a
severe
impact
on
the
state
treasury
solely
for
the
purpose
of
giving
a
windfall
to
mckesson.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
rule
that
we
are
seeking
here
and
advancing
here
is
a
very
narrow
one.
it
is
simply
that
when
a
very
minor
exemption
is
part
of
a
general
taxing
statute
and
is
struck
down,
that
does
not
bring
down
the
entire
taxing
statute
during
the
period
that
the
exemption
was
in
effect.
to
take
an
example
from
a
case
that
this
court
decided
just
a
few
weeks
ago,
the
texas
monthly
case,
the
court
found
that
the
tax
exemption
for
sales
of
religious
publications
in
texas
violated
the
establishment
clause.
although
the
court
did
not
directly
address
the
issue
of
remedy
in
that
case,
the
plurality
opinion
indicated
quite
clearly
its
view
that
texas
monthly
and
other
magazines
of
general
circulation
would
not
be
entitled
to
a
tax
refund
if
on
remand
the
state
courts
eliminated
the
exemption.
indeed,
any
of
those--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--it
is
possible--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--mr.
justice
kennedy,
at
some
point
you
might
get
a
situation
where
a
refund
was
the
only
possible
remedy.
but
that--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
justice
o'connor,
let
me
say
a
couple
of
things.
first
of
all,
of
course,
as
mckesson
itself
points
out,
the
florida
state
courts
in
many
situations
have
given
refunds
of
state
taxes
when
they
are
struck
down
on
various
grounds.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
do
not
think
chevron
is
the
right
analysis
under
any
circumstances,
justice
o'connor.
but
let
me
speak
to
the
particular
point
about
the
so-called
rogue
legislature...
the
legislature
that
there
is
just
no
control
over.
first
of
all,
i
think
that
it
is
a
fair
question
even
in
that
context
whether
the
penalty
of
what
amounts
to
several
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
of
taxes
is
an
appropriate
penalty
for
a
tax
exemption
that
may
confer
$5
million
or
$10
million
worth
of
tax
benefits.
but
the
second
point
that
i
would
make
is
that
the
florida
courts
have
made
very
clear
that
they
will
use
their
injunctive
power
not
just
way
after
the
fact,
but
in
order
to
keep
an
un-constitutional
scheme
from
going
forward
very
shortly
after
it
has
been
enacted.
if
you
look
at
the
history
in
this
particular
case,
when
mckesson
filed
suit,
an
injunction
was
issued
that
was
not
stayed
on
appeal.
but
when
the
1988
statute
was
challenged,
the
court
determined
that
that
was
also
an
un-constitutional
statute,
refused
to
stay
the
injunction
on
appeal,
and
ever
since
the
date
of
that
injunction,
that
statute
has
been...
any
discrepancies
in
that
statute
have
been
enjoined.
so,
the
notion
that
it
is
necessary
to
have
what
is
effectively
a
huge
damages
remedy
in
order
to
control
the
legislature
simply
does
not
fit
with
what
the
florida
courts
have
done
in
this
situation.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
to
begin
with,
let
me
say
that
the
rule
that
mckesson
is
asking
for
is
by
no
means
limited
that
way.
if
the
exemption,
for
example,
had
been
an
exemption
whereby
the
sales
tax
on
distribution
of
local
products
was
no
tax
at
all...
was
a
complete
exemption...
then
they
would
say,
under
their
logic,
that
you
are
entitled
to
all
of
your
taxes
back.
but
in
this
particular
case,
their
refund
request
was
for
$85
million,
just
to
start
with,
and
they
were
just
one
of
a
great
number,
forty
or
fifty,
distributors
of
interstate
products.
now,
even
if
some
portion
of
that
would
not
be
returned
because
it
would
be
covered
by
the
sliding
scale
taxes,
that
still
would
be
an
enormous
amount
of
money,
particularly
if
spread
to
all
distributors.
again,
you
are
looking
at
the
particular
nature
of
the
violation
here.
this
is
a
very
small
exemption
in
a
broad,
general
tax.
and
if
i
could
return
to
texas
monthly
for
a
second,
in
the
dissent
in
texas
monthly,
justice
scalia
points
out
that
there
are
numerous
state
taxes
which
provide
an
exemption
from
ad
valorum
property
taxes
for
the
homes
of
clergymen.
now,
as
i
understand
mckesson's
rule,
if
those
exemptions
are
now
un-constitutional,
at
least
as
of
february
22,
1989,
the
entire
ad
valorem
taxes
in
all
of
those
taxes
are
a
nullity,
and
that
everyone
who
is
not
a
clergyman
and
pays
a
residential
property
tax
could
come
into
court
and
say
i
want
all
of
my
tax
back.
what
effectively
you
are
doing
here
is
not
creating
a
remedy
that
is
tailored
to
the
violation.
it
is
really
creating
an
incentive
for
lawyers
just
to
work
through
the
tax
books
to
try
and
fine
an
exemption,
no
matter
how
minor,
and
then
use
that
exemption,
if
it
is
improper,
to
create
a
tax
shelter
for
years
of
back
taxes.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
understand.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
but,
justice
scalia--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
on
the
merits,
of
course,
the
question
would
be...
it
is
certainly
an
open
question
as
to
whether
that
is
un-constitutional.
but
just
assume
for
a
moment
the
ridiculousness
of
the
remedy
does
not
arise
because
of
the
fact
that
it
would
be
ridiculous
to
say
that
the
difference
is
un-constitutional.
the
absurdity
arises
from
the
fact
that
the
remedy
is
just
wholly
disproportionate
to
the
un-constitutionality,
even
if
it
exists.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
even
in
one
state.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
think
the
question
that
the
court
ought
to
ask
is
under
general
remedial
principles,
what
is
the
proper
remedy?
did
the
florida
state
courts
determine
that
this
was
an
appropriate
remedy,
or
not?
that
is
normally
what
happens
in
the
case
of
a
constitutional
violation.
lower
courts
determine
what
the
remedy
is,
and
this
court
will
review
it--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
to
some
extent
you
do,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
mean,
there
are
state
courts
that
determine
remedies
for
a
constitutional
violation,
and
this
court
has
said,
particularly
in
a
situation
like
allegheny
pittsburgh,
essentially
there
as
no
remedy
at
all
in
a
situation
where
you
are
asking
somebody
to
go
out
and
raise
every
other
person's
allotment
one
by
one
by
some
sort
of
administrative
proceeding.
the
court
has
been
willing
to
go
that
far
in
terms
of
remedy.
but
i
think
that
even
if
this
court
finds
a
role
in
terms
of
reviewing
this
remedy
that
considerable
deference
should
be
given
to
the
state
courts
which
are
obviously
closer
to
the
situation
in
determining
whether
they
have
so
misjudged
the
proper
remedy
and
adequate
remedy
in
this
case
that
their
judgement
should
be
overridden.
and
as
i
submit,
that
is
a
long
way
from
what
is
actually
happening
in
this
case.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
think
chevron
is
not,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
this
court
has
never
said
that
chevron
is
a
general,
all-purpose
rule
for
constitutional
remedies.
chevron,
it
seems
to
me,
applies
in
a
particular
situation
when
the
court
has
established
the
constitutional
rule,
and
the
remedy
is
known,
for
example,
if
there
is
a
constitutional
violation
in
the
criminal
area,
which
i
understand
is
not
specifically
governed
by
chevron.
the
remedy
is
almost
certainly
a
new
trial
in
most
cases,
or
new
sentencing.
there
is
no
dispute
about
the
remedy
itself.
the
question
is,
once
the
violation
and
the
remedy
are
known,
which
group
of
people
gets
the
benefit
of
the
remedy?
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
the
arkansas
supreme
court
in
the
other
case
did
apply
chevron.
in
this
particular
case,
the
florida
supreme
court
did
not
apply
chevron.
it
looked
to
lemon
v.
kurtzman,
which
is
a
decision
that
weighs
heavily
upon
equitable
principles,
and
a
state
case
called
gulesian,
which
makes
no
mention
of
chevron
and
is
based
solely
on
trying
to
balance
the
equities
between
hardship
to
the
treasury
and
the
possible
benefits
to
the
individual
taxpayers.
i
think
that
is
the
course
that
they
quite
clearly
followed
here
in
determining
that
to
go
back
and
to
say
to
mckesson,
"even
though
you
paid
exactly
the
same
tax,
that
you
should
have
paid,
and
the
state
can
constitutionally
require
you
to
pay
in
the
future,
and
is
requiring
you
to
pay
in
the
future,
we
are
not
going
to
go
back
and
say
that
you
are
going
to
get
$85
million
or
even
$50
million
of
a
windfall
just
because
of
these
minor
exemptions.
"
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
oh,
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
that
is
exactly
the
point
that
i
wanted
to
begin
with.
if
this
tax
had
been
enjoined
the
day
before
it
took
effect
at
all,
mckesson
would
not
have
saved
a
penny.
they
would
have
paid
exactly
the
same
amount
of
tax.
the
only
difference
is
that
a
handful
of
sales
which
were
subject
to
a
lower
tax
would
have
been
raised
to
a
higher
tax.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
if
that
is
how
the
injunction
read.
but
that
is
in
fact
the
injunction
that
was
issued
in
this
case,
and
indeed
with
regard
to
the
1988
statute,
the
statute
was
enjoined,
really,
just
a
matter
of
a
couple
of
months
after
it
took
effect.
that
is
again
exactly
what
happened.
it
raised
the
taxes...
it
equalized
the
taxes
for
both
categories
of
taxpayers.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
i
think
there
are
two
points,
justice
scalia.
first
of
all,
i
think
that
it
generally
is
within
the
power
of
the
state
courts...
certainly
the
federal
courts
do
it
with
regard
to
federal
legislation.
they
extend
benefits
and
determine
how--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
in
this
particular
case
the
florida
legislature...
i
think
that
you
do
not
have
to
worry
about
that,
because
the
florida
legislature
effectively
ratified
just
what
the
florida
supreme
court
did
in
this
case.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
your
honor,
first
of
all,
i
am
not
sure
what
mckesson's
ground
is
to
gripe
about
that.
i
mean,
if
mckesson
is
going
to
say
that
it
is
possible
that
the
state
courts
could
not
have
issued
an
injunction
dealing
with
a
state
law,
passed
by
the
state
legislature,
conforming
that
to
the
constitution,
which
would
have
raised
somebody
else's
taxes,
and
because
they
might
not
have
been
able
to
do
that,
we
would
like
to
walk
away
with
$85
million
or
$60
million
in
tax
refunds
seems
to
me
a
burden
that
they
are
not
able
to
carry.
i
was
going
to
mention
the
11th
amendment,
but
i
have
a
feeling
that
in
the
very
brief
time
remaining
that
i
am
not
going
to
be
able
to
say
much
more
than
that
nobody
disagrees
with
the
two
basic
premises
of
our
argument,
which
i
will
not
even
be
allowed
to
state.
thank
you.
[laughter]
