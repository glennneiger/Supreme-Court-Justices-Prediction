justice
scalia
if
this
is
a
state
cause
of
action,
in
the
other
case
there
is
no
dispute
that
you
are
proceeding
under
chevron,
and
the
dispute
is
just
how
chevron
applies.
here,
i
gather,
there
is
a
dispute
as
to
whether
to
use
chevron
or
a
state
rule.
why
should
you
not
use
a
state
rule,
if
it
is
a
state
cause
of
action?
in
other
words,
do
you
not
have
to
establish,
in
this
case,
unlike
the
other
one,
that
it
is
a
federal
right
that
you
are
asserting?
justice
scalia
do
you
agree
that
that
is
essential
to
your
case,
that
you
have
to
establish
that
you
have
a
federal
right
to
the
recovery
of
the
money?
justice
scalia
well,
why
is
it
not,
if
it
is
a
state
right
to
the
recovery
of
the
money,
cannot
the
state
condition
that
right
on
whatever
it
wants,
including
using
its
own
retroactivity?
justice
scalia
well,
why
cannot
i
say
that
it
is
federal...
it
is
un-constitutional
under
federal
law,
and
therefore
in
the
future
you
cannot
do
it?
now,
i
am
willing,
although
i
am
not
bound
to
do
so...
as
a
state,
i
am
willing
to
provide
monetary
compensation
for
past
violations.
but
for
that
purpose,
i
am
going
to
have
my
own
retroactivity
rules.
i
do
not
know
why,
just
because
you
are
deciding
the
unlawfulness
under
federal
law,
you
also
must
decide
the
compensation
under
federal
law.
justice
scalia
even
though
it
is
a
state
remedy,
and
not
a
federal
claim?
justice
scalia
--you
can
get
some
very
horrible
results.
justice
scalia
that
either
shows
that
you
are
right,
or
that
texas
monthly
was
wrong.
but...
or
that
texas
monthly
should
not
be
extended
to
the
logical
conclusion
that
the
clergymen
exemptions
are
wrong.
justice
scalia
even
in
one
state.
justice
scalia
has
anybody
ever
made
a
due
process...
your
solution
seemed
very
nice,
assuming
that
it
is
proper
for
the
florida
courts
to
do
that,
to
say
to
the
people
who
had
the
lower
tax
that
we
are
going
to
determine,
almost
as
as
a
legislature,
that
we
are
going
to
raise
your
tax.
has
there
ever
been
a
due
process
challenge
to
that?
i
mean,
the
legislature
voted
to
tax
me
so
much,
and
here
is
a
court
coming
in
and
saying,
"no,
we
are
going
to
tax
you
more,
because
if
we
do
not
tax
you
more,
we
are
going
to
have
to
give
back
a
lot
of
money
to
these
other
people.
"
justice
scalia
i
am
not
talking
about
extending
the
benefits.
i
am
talking
about
extending
the
detriment.
i
am
talking
about
making
you
pay
tax
which
the
legislature
never
voted.
justice
scalia
well,
we
have
to
worry
about
it
for
the
purposes
of
the
validity
of
your
theory
that
there
is
no
problem.
everything
is
okay.
you
are
just
looking
at
the
matter
as
though
it
had
all
come
up
at
the
time
of
the
injunction,
that
what
the
florida
court
would
have
done
would
have
produced
the
same
result
that
you
are
now
urging
upon
us.
i
am
not
sure
that
they
could
have
done
that.
justice
scalia
do
we
know
whether
the
money
they
did
get
was
granted
pursuant
to
a
state
right
or
a
federal
right?
i
guess
that
we
just
do
not
know.
we
just
know
that
the
state
sovereign
immunity
was
eliminated
for
that,
but
we
do
not
know
whether
the
right
was
a
state
or
federal
one.
there
is
no--
