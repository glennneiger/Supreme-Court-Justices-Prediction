mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
jr.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court,
i
think
that
no
matter
how
one
cuts
it
or
views
it,
the
question
here
today
in
both
cases
is
whether
there
is
a
federal
right
to
e
particular
remedy,
the
remedy
being
tax
refunds.
and
i
notice
that
my
friend
mr.
frey
could
not
avoid
saying
that
right
before
he
sat
down
in
this
case.
he
has
told,
i
think,
only
half
the
story
with
respect
to
what
happened
in
arkansas
here.
two
grounds
were
raised
by
the
trucking
association
and
the
other
petitioners
when
this
case
went
back
to
the
arkansas
supreme
court
on
remand.
they
said
first,
we
are
entitled
to
refunds
under
state
law.
that
is
in
their
opening
brief
and
in
their
reply
brief
in
the
arkansas
court.
they
said
secondly,
even
if
we
are
not
entitled
to
refunds
under
state
law,
the
federal
constitution
requires
that
we
get
refunds,
they
said
also
that
the
only
relevance
that
they
could
see
with
respect
to
the
division
of
refunds
between
before
justice
blackmon's
order
in
august
and
after
justice
blackmon's
order
in
august
was
state
sovereign
immunity,
because
the
state
sovereign
immunity
in
arkansas
runs
like
this.
if
the
money
has
been
deposited
into
the
treasury
of
the
state,
the
state
is
immune
from
suit.
a
suit
cannot
be
brought
against
the
state
to
recover
money
out
of
the
treasury.
it
is
almost
like
edelman
v.
jordan.
however,
if
there
is
an
escrow
account
set
up,
then
the
state
will
refund
money
because
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
state
does
not
attach.
that
is
why,
when
petitioners,
and
mr.
frey
mentioned
this,
went
into
state
court
for
the
first
time
on
this
case
in
1983,
they
sought
a
preliminary
injunction.
what
kind
of
preliminary
injunction
did
they
seek?
they
sought
an
escrow
order.
and
they
said,
and
we
quoted
in
their
preliminary
injunction
brief...
i
think
it
is
on
paged
or
footnote
four
of
our
brief,
but,
let
me
read
it
from
the
record
and
what
they
told
the
arkansas
courts.
and
this
is
on
page
234.
the
court
well
knows
the
rules
of
arkansas,
of
the
arkansas
supreme
court
concerning
tax
monies
paid
voluntarily
and
deposited
in
the
treasury
of
the
state
cannot
be
recovered
except
under
cumbersome
claims
commission
procedures
and
a
special
appropriation
by
the
legislature.
now,
the
point
of
all
this
is
as
follows.
in
the
arkansas
supreme
court,
two
claims
were
raised.
we
are
entitled
to
a
refund
under
state
law,
and
we
are
entitled
to
a
refund
under
the
federal
constitution.
the
petitioners
in
this
case
did
not
get
refund.
therefore,
it
follows
necessarily
that
the
arkansas
court
rejected
both
of
those
arguments.
as
i
said,
the
question,
no
matter
how
one
looks
at
it
in
this
case,
is
whether
there
is
some,
to
quote
mr.
frey,
federal
right
to
a
refund.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
jr.
under
state
law,
because
it
was
in,
the
money
was
in
escrow,
and
there
is
no
sovereign
immunity--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
jr.
--there
is
an
illegal
exaction
statute,
and
the
court--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
jr.
--there
is
a
constitutional--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
jr.
--there
is
a
constitutional
provision
that
is
set
against,
the
state
cannot
be
sued
in
its
own
courts,
and
that
constitutional
provision
gives
way
when
the
money
is
in
an
escrow
account.
there
is
a
case
from
the
1940s,
i
believe,
called
crossett
lumber
company.
we
cited
it
on
page
4
of
our
brief,
or
in
footnote
4,
that
explains
all
that.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
jr.
you
cannot
tell
in
the
face
of
the
opinion
or
the
judgement.
but
for
what
it
is
worth,
the
petitioners
in
this
case
filed
a
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
arkansas
supreme
court,
claiming
that
sovereign
immunity
had
been
decided,
and
that
the
court
had
decided
sovereign
immunity
incorrectly
and
should
not
have
prevented
them
from
getting
refunds
prior
to
justice
blackmon's
escrow
order.
but,
regardless,
this
court
is
sitting
to
decide
federal
questions,
and
the
federal
question
presented
in
our
case
is,
do
they
nave
a
right
to
a
refund?
now,
they
argue
on
the
chevron
basis,
and
claim,
i
suppose,
that
that
is
not
really
a
claim
under
federal
law
for
a
refund,
although
the
argument
in
favor
of
retroactivity
is,
we
are
entitled
to
a
refund.
that
is
why
chevron
should
be
retroactive.
and
i
think
we
just
keep
going
around
in
circles.
the
question
here
is,
i
think,
essentially,
does
the
constitution,
does
the
commerce
clause,
should
it
be
enforced
by
the
court
not
only
by
granting
injunctive
relief
but
also
by
giving
retroactive
monetary
awards?
that
is
the
question.
and
our
brief
addresses
that
question,
and
points
out
a
number
of
factors
here.
and
i
would
like
to
go
into
them
in
the
context
of
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
which
i
need
to
address
because
i
think
there
has
been
some
misunderstanding
about
what
we
have,
what
is
involved
exactly
here.
the
tax
that
is
concerned
in
the
arkansas
case
applied
only
to
the
heaviest
trucks
in
the
industry.
those
trucks
weigh
more
than
36
tons...
up
to
40
tons.
all
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
and
all
of
the
petitioners
here,
are
interstate
carriers.
they
are
not
intrastate
carriers.
now,
we
heard
about
a
test
that
said
that
truckers
base-registered
in
arkansas
pay
three
times
less
than
truckers
based
elsewhere.
that
is
not
a
test
that
has
anything
to
do
with
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce,
because
it
is
a
test
that
takes
a
group
of
interstate
truckers,
and
compares
them
to
another
group
of
interstate
truckers.
there
is,
in
six
years
of
litigation
here,
there
has
never
been
one
intra,
wholly
intrastate
truck
identified
that
is
hauling
40
tons
back
and
forth
from
fort
smith
to
little
rock,
or
wherever,
in
arkansas.
these
are
the
jumbos
of
the
industry,
and
to
ask
the
question
how
many
intrastate
trucks
there
are
involved
in
this
case
is
to
ask
why
do
we
not
use
the
queen
mary
as
the
staten
island
ferry.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
jr.
the
remedy
that
they
are
seeking
is
not
a
remedy
to
put
interstate
commerce
on
a
plane
of
equality
with
intrastate
commerce,
because
that
remedy
does
not
have
anything
to
do
with
it.
more
than
that,
you
will
notice
in
the
brief
here
that
the
petitioners
never
identity
who
they
are
very
odd
in
a
brief.
but
we
never
know
who
the
plaintiffs
are,
who
the
petitioners
are.
the
reason
for
that,
i
think,
is
that
when
this
case
began,
two
arkansas
based
truckers,
jones,
for
example,
and
cawood,
who
are
named
petitioners
here,
were
base-registered
in
arkansas.
a
couple
years
later,
as
exhibit
3
in
the
state
supreme
court
shows,
they
just
registered
and
got
their
license
plates
from
other
states.
now
they
are
in
the
out
of
state
class,
because
truckers
can
base
register
wherever
they
have
a
telephone,
basically.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
intra
versus
interstate
commerce,
and
it
is
not
a
question
of
residency
or
favoring
local
commerce.
so
that
is
the
way
this
case
shapes
up
here.
and
what
we
have
got...
i
notice
there
is
an
analogy
of
football,
a
football
analogy,
that
the
petitioners
use
here.
they
talk
about
the
university
of
arkansas,
and
people
being
charged
three
times
as
much
to
go
to
see
the
game,
and
it
is
not
an
answer
to
say,
well,
even
though
they
were
charged
three
times
as
much,
take
a
look
at
what
happened.
they
saw
the
game.
that
does
not
mean
they
should
not
get
a
refund.
this
case
here
is
before
the
court
as
a
case
where
the
entire
stadium
is
filled
with
interstate
truckers,
where
they
have
gone
into
arkansas,
into
the
stadium,
to
make
money,
they
made--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
jr.
--yes.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
jr.
i
do
not.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
jr.
well,
i
do
not
think
this
class
suffered,
and
that
is
what
i
am
about
to--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
jr.
--because
of
the
internal
consistency
test
of
scheiner.
if
every
other
state
had
passed
a
tax
like
this
on
the
heaviest
trucks,
then
interstate
commerce
would
have
been
deferred,
because
you
would
want
to
stay
within
the
state
and
not
go.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
jr.
yes,
i
think--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
jr.
--we
have
to
be
careful...
there
is
a
pejorative
attached
to
"victim
of
discrimination".
i
mean,
it
is
clear
that
we
do
not
have
a
14th
amendment,
equal
protection
or
due
process
here.
the
court
itself
said
in
scheiner
that
congress
could
have
done
this,
and
i
take
it
that
means
that
congress
would
not
be
violating
the
14th
amendment
of
equal
protection.
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
truckers
who
were
allowed
to
come
into
the
state
for
the
first
time.
they
were
just
charged
under
the
wrong
formula.
they
made
$115
million
a
year.
the
roads
of
arkansas
suffered
to
the
tune
of
$53
million
a
year,
and
the
total
taxes
collected
were
only
$26
million.
there
was
a
subsidy
there,
even
under
the
old
scheme,
and
what
the
petitioners
are
asking
for
is
to
be
subsidized
even
more.
the
amount
of
the
tax
they
paid
in
total
was
certainly
fair.
it
was
far
less
than
the
damage
they
were
causing
to
the
highways
of
arkansas.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
jr.
that
is
true.
but
this
leads
me--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
jr.
--if
you
had
summarily
reversed
instead
of
remanding
and
asking
for
reconsideration,
then
i
think
the
arkansas
tax
would
have
been
void
at
that
moment.
what
would
have
happened
then
is
that
the
legislature
of
arkansas
would
have
had
to
convene
a
special
session.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
jr.
i
would
say
that
they
would
be
violating
an
order
of
this
court
or
an
order
of
the
arkansas
court,
and
i
think
that
sanctions
would
be
appropriate.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
jr.
well,
if
you
reverse,
then
the
arkansas
court,
i
think
we
have
to
presume,
would
follow
the
law.
they
are
bound
to
follow
the
law
of
this
court
as
well
as
any
other
court.
what
you
are
asking
is
what
if
the
arkansas
court
defied
this
court,
and
i
think
it
is
an
unrealistic
hypothetical.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
jr.
well,
it
they
did,
they
would
have
been
enjoined
immediately,
and
the
money
would
not
have
been
going
into
the
treasury
of
arkansas,
because
it
is
not
deposited
until
after
a
certain
period
of
time.
and
i
think
that
it
would
not
have
been
a
sovereign
immunity
problem
them,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
jr.
i
do
not,
think
it
was
all...
i
think
it
i
relevant,
but
i
do
not
think
it
was
all
that
clear.
the
petitioners
rested
on
a
factual
basis
in
their
claim
in
the
arkansas
courts.
there
were
no
finding
of
fact
in
this
case...
zero.
the
arkansas
court
denied
relief
on
the
basis
of
aero
mayflower
in
the
record
is
stale.
the
figures
that
mr.
frey
refers
to
are
from
1983.
we
do
not
know
what
the
situation
was
in
1985.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
jr.
i
think
that
there
was
a
question
about
whether
there
was
a
factual
basis
for
a
difference.
but
i
would
like
to
just
conclude
here,
if
i
may,
with
the
question
of
the
commerce
clause.
this
is
a
commerce
clause
violation.
does
it
bring
with
it,
a
right
to
receive
retroactive
monetary
awards
in
the
form,
in
these
cases,
of
taxes?
and
i
say
no.
the
commerce
clause
is
only
a
grant,
of
authority
to
congress,
and
whatever
its
negative
implications
are,
they
do
not
carry
with
it
a
license
to
the
judiciary,
the
federal
judiciary,
to
create
damage
remedies.
it
is
ironic
in
this
case,
now
that
arkansas
has
conformed
its
statute
to
the
requirements
of
this
court,
that
to
require
that
kind
of
relief,
petitioners
say,
well,
they
can
just
raise
their
taxes
on
heavy
trucks.
but
to
do
that
would
put
in
arkansas
a
barrier...
the
kind
of
barrier
or
a
similar
type
of
barrier
that
this
court
has
talked
about
in
scheiner,
to
keep
other
trucks
out.
arkansas
has
a
2.5
cent
per
mile
tax
now.
it
raises
$26
million
a
year.
petitioners
are
asking
for
$122
million
or
so
in
refunds.
that
means
that,
arkansas
would
have
to
raise
its
tax
to
collect
that,
if
we
are
talking
about
a
fiscal
year,
to
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
15,
16,
17
cents
a
mile...
assuming
that
any
interstate
trucker
would
be
fool
enough
not
to
go
around
arkansas
after
that
tax
was
in
effect.
that
creates
a
barrier.
is
that
the
way
the
commerce
clause
should
be
enforced
to
preserve
congress'
prerogative?
if
congress
had
legislated
scheiner,
they
would
not
have
made
that
decision
retroactive,
and
we
cited
legislation
in
our
brief
to
show
that
when
congress
does
legislate
with
respect
to
state
taxes,
it
makes
its
decision
prospectively
only,
prospective
only.
indeed,
in
the
railroad
area,
when
congress
legislated
and
found
certain
state
taxes
to
be
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce,
they
gave
the
states
three
years
to
adjust
their
state
property
system.
now,
here,
all
we
are
asking
for
is
prospective
only,
in
terms
of
what
the
relief
ought
to
be.
and
it
is
not
that
these
truckers
suffered,
because
they
made
$115
million
a
year
as
a
result
of
arkansas'
decision
to
open
its
highways
up
to
them.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
jr.
from
the
date
that
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
state
did
not
apply,
which
would
be
august
14,
1987.
and
they
have
gotten
that
relief.
and
what
we
are
saying
is--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
jr.
--that
was
the
date
of
the
escrow
order
ordered
by
justice
blackmon.
