mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
1983,
the
arkansas
legislature
enacted
the
highway
use
equalization
tax,
imposed
for
the
right
to
operate
certain
heavy
trucks
on
the
state's
highways.
this
tax
was
assessed
at
a
rate
of
five
cents
a
mile,
up
to
a
ceiling
of
$175
or
3,500
miles
of
operation.
all
operations
each
year
in
excess
of
3,500
miles
were
untaxed.
now,
because
vehicles
base
registered
in
arkansas
tend
to
make
much
more
extensive
use
of
the
state's
highways
than
non-arkansas
vehicles,
the
free
ride
given
by
arkansas
for
operations
in
excess
of
3,500
miles
resulted,
as
both
courts
below
found,
in
a
substantially
lower
tax
cost
per
mile
for
arkansas
than
for
non-arkansas
truckers.
in
fact,
most
members
of
the
petitioner
class
paid
the
five
cent
a
mile
option,
and
the
average
cost
for
the
in-state
vehicle
was
one
cent
per
mile.
now,
before
this
hue
tax
even
went
into
effect,
this
suit
was
filed
challenging
the
validity
of
the
tax
on
various
grounds,
and
on
behalf
of
a
subclass
consisting
of
non-arkansas
base
registered
truckers,
a
challenge
was
made
under
the
commerce
clause
to
the
hue
flat
tax
on
precisely
the
grounds
ultimately
upheld
by
this
court
in
the
scheiner
case
some
four
and
a
half
years
later.
now,
this
extended
effort
by
interstate
truckers
to
rid
themselves
of
the
discriminatory
hue
tax...
i
think
it
is
important
to
appreciate
what
we
went
through
during
this
period.
we
began
with
an
effort
to
have
the
tax
proceeds
placed
in
escrow
rather
than
deposited
in
the
state
treasury,
to
facilitate
refunds
in
the
event
that
the
tax
was
struck
down.
that
was
rejected.
we
went
through
the
lower
arkansas
courts
and
the
arkansas
supreme
court,
and
they
upheld
the
validity
of
the
tax
under
the
commerce
clause.
the
case
came
up
here.
eventually,
after
the
scheiner
decision,
it
was
remanded.
after
it
was
remanded,
the
state
continued
to
collect
the
tax,
doing
everything
in
its
power
to
delay
the
inevitable
decision
holding
it
un-constitutional
under
the
principles
of
scheiner.
as
a
result
of
these
efforts,
we
came
back
to
justice
blackmon,
a
circuit
justice,
seeking
the
imposition
of
an
escrow
to
stop
the
bleeding,
basically,
and
it
was
granted,
and
the
funds
from
august
14,
1987
on
were
placed
in
escrow.
this,
i
think,
is
what
produced
legislation
in
arkansas
in
october
of
1987
repealing
the
hue
tax
and
replacing
it
with
a
tax
of
2.5
cents
per
mile,
but
not
flat...
it
would
be
paid
by
everybody.
the
arkansas
supreme
court
actually
did
not
get
around
to
invalidating
the
hue
tax
in
this
case
until
march
of
1988.
now,
in
what
some
might
consider
a
tacit
admission
of
weakness
on
the
merits
of
the
retroactivity
issues
brought
before
this
court
for
review,
arkansas
devotes
nearly
half
of
its
brief
to
strikingly
novel
and,
we
think,
quite
farfetched
arguments
designed
to
avoid
the
merits,
such
is
the
contention
that
the
11th
amendment
bars
the
exercise
of
appellate
jurisdiction
over
a
federal
question
decided
by
a
state
court
in
any
case
that
could
not
have
been
brought
within
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts.
now,
unless
there
are
questions
on
issues
of
this
sort,
i
would
like
to
devote
my
limited
time
to
the
merits
of
the
retroactivity
issue.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
do
not
believe
that
question
is
the
question
for
this
court
at
this
time.
that
is,
this
is
a
suit
that
was
brought
under
the
illegal
exactions
provision
of
the
arkansas
constitution,
and
i
think
that
it
has
to
be
taken
as
matters
stand
in
this
court,
although
there
is
an
unresolved
claim
of
sovereign
immunity
in
the
case,
as
matters
stand
in
this
court,
in
light
of
the
decision
of
the
arkansas
supreme
court,
arkansas
will
give
refunds
if
these
taxes
were
exacted
in
violation
of
federal
law.
whether
they
were
exacted
in
violation
of
federal
law
depends,
in
arkansas'
view,
on
the
application
of
the
chevron
test.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
happens
to
be
constitutional.
it
is
a
provision
under
the
arkansas
constitution.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
would
argue
that
if
we
were
pressed
to
it
in
a
subsequent
stage
of
this
case.
we
do
not
argue
that
now.
that
is,
we
do
believe
there
is
a
federal--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--no,
no.
first
of
all,
it
is
not
our
bottom
line,
because
the
question
here
is
whether...
the
question
of
whether
scheiner
is
retroactive
is
a
question
of
what,
substantive
rule
of
law
governs
our
claim
for
refund
of
taxes.
i
do
not
believe
it
is
a
question
of
our
right
to
a
remedy.
now,
if
you
say
that
the
substantive
rule
of
law
that
governs
this
case
is
not
aero
mayflower
but
scheiner,
you
remand
the
case
back
to
the
arkansas
supreme
court.
we
believe
that
under
arkansas
law,
we
would
be
entitled
to
a
remedy
at
that
point.
now,
if
the
arkansas
courts
were
to
say,
we
are
sorry,
you
are
not
entitled
to
any
remedy,
than
they
would
have
to
overcome
an
argument
that
we
have
made
and
would
make
again
that
federal
law
requires
a
refund.
when
i
say
a
refund,
i
do
not
mean
necessarily
100
percent
of
the
taxes,
put
some
retroactive
relief.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
simply
decided...
which
was
all
it
needed
to
decide
if
it
was
correct...
that
under
the
chevron
test,
scheiner
was
not
retroactive,
and
we
agree
that
if
that
ruling
is
correct,
we
lose.
our
claim
for
refunds
is
foreclosed.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
did
order
a
refund.
in
other
words,
they
decided
in
effect
that
the
effective
date
of
the
scheiner
decision
was
august
14.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
significant
thing
about
the
fact
that
they
ordered
a
refund
is
that
it
shows
that
there
is
an
arkansas
refund
remedy.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
so
i
do
not
believe
that
we
have
the
problem
that
you
have
posed
at
this
stage
of
the
case.
it
is
a
fascinating
problem,
but
i
do
not
think
that
you
have
to
decide
it
on
our
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
may
be.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
there
are
cases...
you
have
pending
on
your
docket
the
ashland
oil
case,
which
was
a
sales
tax
type
of
case,
gross
receipts
tax
case,
where
the
tax
was
not
paid,
and
they
were
sued
by
the
state.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
in
this
kind
of
tax,
that
cannot
be
done,
because
basically
there
would
be
criminal
penalties
for
attempting
to
operate
in
the
state
of
arkansas
without
having
paid
the
tax.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
arkansas
would
not
allow
payment
under
protest.
but
we
did
file
a
suit...
i
think
that
it
is
quite
clear
under
this
court's
precedents,
and
i
do
not
think
that
arkansas
contests
it,
that
the
filing
of
the
suit
before
any
payments
of
the
tax
were
made
constitutes
the
equivalent
of
a
protest
for
purposes
of
federal
constitutional
law.
we
did
everything
in
our
power
to
resist
the
payment
of
the
tax,
including
asking
for
an
escrow.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
would
say
this.
first
of
all,
the
question
of
whether
taxes
were
passed
on,
which
no
claim
of
pass-on
has
made
in
our
case,
would
figure
in
for
the
federal
chevron
test.
that
is,
it
would
relate
to
the
equities
of
making
a
refund.
now,
it
might
also
relate
to
a
separate,
that
is,
the
state
may
have
a
separate
rule.
for
example,
states
sometimes
have
rules
that
if
you
did
not
bear
the
legal
incidence
of
the
tax,
say,
in
the
case
of
a
sales
tax,
the
person
that
remits
the
tax,
the
store,
is
just
a
collector
of
the
tax.
some
states
have
rules
that
say
you
cannot
get
a
refund
if
the
tax
is
invalid.
the
question
for
this
court
would
be
whether
that
would
be,
i
think,
an
adequate
state
ground
for
denying
a
refund.
but
i
think
it
is
clear
from
this
court's
decisions
that
where
the
state
court
decides
a
question
of
federal
law
is
the
basis
for
its
decision,
this
court
clearly
has
jurisdiction
to
review
it.
michigan
against
long
three
affiliated
tribes...
this
goes
back
to
standard
oil
v.
johnson
in
1942,
or
even
further.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
suggest...
everyone
has
thought
it.
most
of
the
state
amicus
briefs
in
this
case
suggest
the
chevron
test.
the
court
has
generally
dealt
with
questions
of
retroactivity
under
the
chevron
test
in
the
civil
area.
we
think
the
chevron
test
should
be
modified
in
the
case
of
constitutional
violations
by
the
government
in
light
of
the
principles
that
were
set
forth
in
the
owen
case.
we
think
that
there
is
a
different
problem
presented
when
the
government
violates
constitutional
rights
and
then
seeks
to
avoid
retroactive
application.
on
the
other
hand,
we
think
the
chevron
best
does
state,
in
a
general
sense,
the
framework
that
you
would
look
at.
we
have
not
pressed
our
position
so
far
as
to
say
that
all
decisions
involving
claims
of
constitutional
violation
have
to
be
retroactive.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
do
not
understand
the
state
to
be
arguing
that
in
this
case.
if
they
are
arguing
that,
that
is
news
to
me.
now,
they
have
argued
that
the
commerce
clause
does
not
of
its
own
force
provide
a
cause
of
action
or
provide
a
right
to
relief.
we
do
not
agree
with
that,
but
my
point
again
is
that
arkansas
law,
as
justice
white
pointed
out,
clearly
provides
a
right
to
relief,
because
we
got
it
on
the
escrow
monies.
so
i
do
not...
i
think
this
is
all
a
distraction,
and
not
a
problem,
in
this
case.
now,
i
think,
given
the
limitations
of
time...
i
have
said
a
little
bit
about
the
first
prong
of
the
chevron
test,
which
goes
to
the
question
of
the
extent
of
justifiable
reliance
by
the
party
seeking
non-retroactive
application.
now,
you
have
to
look
at
this
case
with
the
understanding
that
it
is
now...
we
now
know,
in
light
of
the
scheiner
decision,
that
the
state
exacted
from
non-arkansas
truckers
millions
of
dollars
of
taxes,
un-constitutionally.
that
is
a
fact
that
we
know.
the
question
we
are
addressing
in
the
retroactivity
inquiry
is
whether
the
rules
under
which
this
action
was
un-constitutional
should
not
apply.
the
first
prong
of
this
retroactivity
inquiry
asked
how
strong
is
the
reliance
interest
of
the
people
who
say
do
not
apply
the
correct
rule
of
law
to
this
case.
now,
i
am
willing
to
concede
that
before
scheiner
was
decided,
the
outcome
was
not
a
sure
thing.
i
think
scheiner
was
a
close
case.
it
could
have
gone
either
way.
the
thing
that
made
it
a
close
case
was
the
old
aero
mayflower
precedents.
i
think
that
even
justice
o'connor,
in
your
dissent,
that
was
the
factor
that
was
critical
in
your
concerns
in
that
case.
i
think
that
but
for
aero
mayflower,
there
would
not
have
been
any
serious
dispute
under
complete
auto
and
commonwealth
edison
about
the
un-constitutionality
of
the
hue
tax.
now,
all
i
want
to
say
about
this
kind
of
a
close
case
is
that
if
you
satisfy
the
first
prong...
the
first
prong
of
chevron
is
designed
to
establish
the
general
rule
that
most
decisions
are
retroactive.
non-retroactivity
is
the
exception.
now,
if
you
say
every
case
that
is
close
qualifies
for
treatment
as
a
non-retroactive
case,
you
are
basically
saying
that
virtually
every
case
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
decides
is
presumptively
or
likely
to
be
non-retroactive,
where
you
have
to
go
through
a
chevron
analysis.
i
wonder
whether
you
want
to
walk
down
that
road.
now,
let
me
turn
to
the
second
prong
very
briefly,
and
there
is
wealth
of
things
to
cover
here.
but
it
is
a
very
important
point
that
the
state
court
missed,
and
that
the
state
misses
in
its
brief,
in
talking
about
the
importance
of
the
policies
that
underlay
the
scheiner
rule,
and
whether,
in
deciding
the
retroactivity
of
scheiner,
you
would
be
furthering
or
impeding
those
policies.
they
say,
well,
there
are
no
individual
rights
under
the
commerce
clause,
they
say,
well,
the
problem
has
been
cured
for
the
future,
so
what
is
the
problem?
now,
what
they
are
turning
a
blind
eye
to
is
the
institutional
concerns
that
underlie
the
commerce
clause
itself,
which
is
the
tremendous
hydraulic
pressures
on
state
legislators
to
enact
parochial,
discriminatory
legislation
that
favors
local
interests
at
the
expenses
of
out-of-state
interests.
we
would
say
that
the
commerce
clause
cases
are
almost
a
paradigm
of
the
case
in
which
the
second
prong
of
the
chevron
test
calls
for
full
retroactivity.
let
me
just
say,
i
will
not
talk
about
the
equities,
because
my
time
is
running
out.
i
would
just
like
to
say
one
word
about
the
post-scheiner
taxes,
and
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
i
do
not
understand.
the
state
collected
substantial
sums
of
money
after
scheiner
was
decided
under
a
tax
that
was
plainly
un-constitutional.
it
makes
no
defense
here--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--no
we
are
certainly...
they
should
pay
their
fair
share.
what
we
are
looking
for
is,
arkansas
was
willing
to
let
its
own
people
operate
their
trucks
on
the
highways
for
basically
one
cent
a
mile.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
certainly.
certainly.
the
problem
is
that
we
should
not
be
made
to
pay
the
tax
that
should
have
been
paid
by
the
arkansas
people,
and
that
is
the
focus
of
our
complaint.
we
are
not
seeking
refunds.
we
do
not
say
federal
law
requires
every
penny
of
tax
that
we
paid
to
be
refunded.
we
say
federal
law
requires
a
refund
of
the
illegal
portion,
the
discriminatory
portion.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
with
respect
to
the
question
that
justice
o'connor
has
asked
several
times,
whether
chevron
is
the
test,
i
think
that
we
should
remember
that
the
norm
is
to
apply
the
correct
federal
rule
of
law.
we
are
looking
for
when
it
is
justifiable
not
to
apply
correct
federal
law.
the
chevron
test
is
an
effort
by
this
court
to
explain
those
circumstances.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
would
say
that
it
would
go
back
to
1983.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
when
we
say
that
when
the
statute
was
enacted,
it
was--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--no.
anybody
should
have
known
that
it
might
be
un-constitutional,
and
we
say
that
is
enough
to
satisfy
the
first
prong.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
do
say
it
should
go
back
to
1983.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
even
though,
yes.
we
do,
and
we
have
tried
to
explain
in
our
brief.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
let
me
just
say
a
couple
of
things.
state
sovereign
immunity
is
clearly
not
the
ground
of
the
decision
of
the
arkansas
supreme
court.
you
can
read
that
opinion.
i
defy
anybody
to
find
a
word
in
there
about
sovereign
immunity.
they
may
rule
sovereign
immunity
if
the
case
gets
back
to
them.
i
think
mr.
randolph
has
confused
the
cause
of
action,
which
is
a
state
cause
of
action
for
refund,
with
the
defense
of
sovereign
immunity.
it
is
clear
that
we
have
a
cause
of
action
for
a
refund.
what
i
believe
has
not
yet
been
passed
upon
by
the
arkansas
supreme
court,
and
i
think
its
silence
is
significant,
because
normally
sovereign
immunity
would
be
decided
as
the
ground
of
decision
if
it
existed...
sovereign
immunity.
they
have
held
that
the
provision
of
the
constitution
does
justify
refunds,
thus
reach
refunds
against,
counties
and
cities.
they
have
held
that
the
provision
does
apply
to
the
state.
they
have
not
yet
addressed
the
question
of
whether
it
applies
to
refunds
from
the
state.
now,
finally,
mr.
randolph
says
that
the
commerce
clause
does
not
reach
the
discrimination
between
arkansas-based
interstate
operators
anti
non-arkansas
interstate
operators.
that
is
totally
inconsistent
with
scheiner
itself.
that
kind
of
discrimination
is
clearly
reached
by
the
commerce
clause.
the
only
people
who
maintain
this
claim,
this
claim,
are
the
non-arkansas
based
people.
now,
i
think
it
is
also
relevant,
and
we
have
answered,
i
think,
everything
that
mr.
randolph
has
said
today...
we
have
addressed
in
our
reply
brief,
so
i
will
not
try
to
cover
all
those
things,
and
i
cannot
in
the
time
i
have.
i
think
that
it
is
clear
that
there
is
discrimination
both
between
our
members
and
arkansas
intrastate,
and
between
our
members
and
arkansas
interstate.
now,
there
is
some
talk
about
the
effect
of
refund
decision
on
interstate
commerce.
justice
o'connor
in
your
opinion
in
scheiner
itself,
you
expressed
a
concern
about
the
effect
on
the
state
budget
of
refunds.
and
i
think
it
is
important
to
understand,
first
of
all,
the
refunds
do
not
all
have
to
be
paid
in
a
year.
we
are
not
talking
about,
raising
a
tax.
the
refunds
can
be
spread
out.
they
can
be
financed
by
bonds.
not
a
word
was
said
about
the
various
ameliorative
steps
that
can
be
taken.
secondly,
the
state
is
a
conduit--
