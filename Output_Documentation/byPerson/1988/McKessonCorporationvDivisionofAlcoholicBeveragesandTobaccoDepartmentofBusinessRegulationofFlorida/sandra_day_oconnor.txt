justice
o'connor
so
you
do
not
argue
that
there
is
some
federal
rule
requiring
a
refund
whenever
a
state
tax
is
struck
down
as
un-constitutional?
justice
o'connor
that
is
your
bottom
line...
you
think
there
is
some
flat
federal
requirement
that.
whenever
a
state
tax
is
struck
down
as
un-constitutional
that
refunds
are
required?
justice
o'connor
are
our
cases
clear
that
chevron
is
the
appropriate
test
to
apply
for
determining
retroactivity?
justice
o'connor
well,
the
state
says,
i
guess,
that
we
should
apply
the
state
rules
on
retroactivity,
not
a
federal
rule
at
all.
justice
o'connor
and
you
take
that
position
that
the
rule
that
has
to
be
applied
is
the
chevron
rule?
justice
o'connor
how
in
that
chevron
test
does
the
action,
the
continuing
action
of
the
florida
legislative
process
fit
into
the
test?
justice
o'connor
well,
why
is
that
point
not
here?
i
mean,
there
certainly
is
evidence
of
an
apparent
pattern
of
conduct
by
the
state
legislature
in
florida
whereby
the
state
court
will
find
law
un-constitutional,
or
the
tax,
and
then
the
court
will
apply
it
only
prospectively,
and
the
legislature
devises
a
new
variation
every
time
one
is
struck
down?
justice
o'connor
well,
but
let
us
say
that
this
is
a
situation
where
they
have
not,
and
there
is
just
this
pattern
avoiding
giving
anything
back.
should
chevron
be
applied
then,
in
those
circumstances?
justice
o'connor
well,
suppose
we
were
to
agree
with
the
petitioner
that
in
view
of
florida's
action
here,
that
the
court...
we
should
not
just
abstain
from
deciding
the
issue,
as
the
court
did
in
bacchus
and
tyler
pipe
and
scheiner,
but
that
some
rule
ought
to
apply.
what
should
that
rule
be?
justice
o'connor
and
you
think
chevron
is
not
the
proper
stand?
justice
o'connor
well,
apparently
both
parties
in
the
other
case
do
not
take
issue
with
the
application
of
chevron.
justice
o'connor
that
was
the
date
of
the
arkansas
court
decision?
