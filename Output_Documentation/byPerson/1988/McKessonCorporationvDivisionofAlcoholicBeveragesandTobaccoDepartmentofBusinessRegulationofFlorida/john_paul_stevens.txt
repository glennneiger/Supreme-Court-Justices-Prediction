justice
stevens
mr.
randolph,
can
i
interrupt
with
a
question?
justice
stevens
at
this
stage
of
the
litigation,
you
do
not
challenge
the...
you
do
not
defend
the
constitutionality
of
this
scheme
that
as
in
place,
do
you?
justice
stevens
so
there
is
a
class
that
suffered,
and
a
class
that
benefited?
justice
stevens
well,
then
why
was
the
statute
un-constitutional?
justice
stevens
but
then
under
your
view,
it,
seems
to
me
that
they
should
not
even
enjoin
the
further
collection
of
the
tax,
if
there
are
not
some
victims
of
this
discrimination
out
there.
maybe
i
misunderstand
your
argument.
justice
stevens
but
that
seems
to
be
where
it
is
leading.
