mr.
david
g.
robertson
yes,
we
are.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
june,
1986,
petitioner
mckesson
decided
to
challenge
florida's
successive
enactments
of
the
alcoholic
beverage
tax
schemes
that
discriminated
against
interstate
commerce
in
favor
of
local
interests.
mckesson's
constitutional
claims
in
state
court
requested
relief
both
prospectively
and
retroactively.
for
prospective
relief,
we
asked
the
state
court
to
enjoin
the
starers
continuing
enforcement
of
a
discriminatory
tax,
and
for
retroactive
relief,
we
asked
the
state
court
to
grant
florida's
historic
remedy
for
a
discriminatory,
un-constitutional
tax,
a
florida
tax
refund.
mckesson
challenged
florida's
alcoholic
beverage
tax
scheme
on
commerce
clause
and
other
constitutional
grounds.
mckesson
argued
that
the
florida
tax,
both
in
purpose
and
in
effect,
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce
in
favor
of
local
interest.
mckesson
specifically
invoked
florida's
general
tax
refund
scheme,
specifically
section
216.25.
mckesson
argued
that
under
this
court's
decisions,
as
well
as
the
state
statute,
the
appropriate
remedy
for
the
extraction
of
un-constitutional
taxes
was
the
return,
not
of
the
entire
tax,
but
only
of
the
discriminatory
portion
of
the
tax.
in
february,
1988,
a
unanimous
florida
supreme
court
agreed
with
mckesson
that
the
florida
tax
scheme
discriminated
against
interstate
commerce
in
violation
of
the
commerce
clause.
the
court
recognized
that
mckesson's
disfavored
products
directly
competed
with
the
local
producer's
favored
products.
the
court
recognized
that
as
a
result
of
the
tax
scheme,
the
state
in
effect
had
to
use
the
courts...
stripped
away
from
mckesson
its
natural
economic
advantages,
and
thus
the
court
concluded
that
the
tax
scheme
has
disadvantaged
mckesson,
raising
our
relative
cost
of
doing
business,
and
had
advantaged
mckesson's
favorite
competitors.
nevertheless,
despite
this
court's
decisions
on
constitutional
tax
refunds,
despite
the
florida
court's
own
decisions,
and
despite
those
findings
of
competitive
injury,
the
state
refused
to
refund
any
portion
of
the
un-constitutional
taxes.
the
florida
court
denied
mckesson
relief
by
constructing
it's
own
retroactivity
doctrine
that
totally
collides
with
this
court's
retroactivity
doctrine
in
chevron.
mr.
david
g.
robertson
we
take
the
position
that
when
a
state
court
invokes
the
federal
constitution
to
declare
a
state
tax
un-constitutional,
the
court
should
use
the
chevron
standard
to
decide
whether
that
finding
should
be
applied
retroactively
or
only
prospectively.
mr.
david
g.
robertson
we
brought
florida's
continuing
history
of
enacting
un-constitutional
statutes
to
the
attention
of
the
florida
courts
for
two
reasons,
vis
a
vis
chevron.
first,
under
our
commerce
clause
claim,
we
wanted
the
court
to
see
what
the
legislature's
purpose
was
in
enacting
the
particular
statutes.
secondly,
vis
a
vis
chevron,
we
wanted
to
demonstrate
to
the
court
that
in
applying
a
test
for
retroactivity,
the
court
should
pay
close
attention
to
whether
our
basic
commerce
clause
interests
in
the
national
common
market
would
be
frustrated
or
advanced
by
a
particular
remedial
measure.
mckesson,
indeed,
submits
that
chevron's
first
prong
should
be
a
threshold
test.
chevron's
first
prong,
of
course,
requires
a
court
to
demonstrate
that
it
has
established
a
new
rule
of
law.
and
the
reasoning
of
chevron
strongly
suggests
that
that
initial
requirement
should
be
a
threshold
requirement.
chevron,
of
course,
cites
to
hanover
shoe,
and
hanover
shoe
says
that
a
court
has
absolutely
no
reason
to
consider
the
theory
of
prospectivity
unless
the
court
has
overruled
clearly
declared
judicial
precedent,
and
therefore
needs
to
consider
whether
parties
who
reasonably
relied
upon
a
law
may
be
injured
by
retroactive
application
of
the
new
law.
mr.
david
g.
robertson
well,
in
this
particular
case,
we
based
our
claim
upon
the
commerce
clause,
and
we
said
to
the
florida
supreme
court
that
we
were
entitled,
as
a
matter
of
federal
as
well
as
state
law,
to
a
refund
of
the
discriminatory
taxes.
and
the
florida
supreme
court
in
its
opinion,
notes
that
fact.
mr.
david
g.
robertson
we
do
not
believe
that
that
is
essential,
because
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
david
g.
robertson
--in
this
particular
case,
the
only
basis
for
the
state
supreme
court's
refusing
to
grant
a
refund
was
its
application
of
a
retroactivity
standard.
all
we
are
saying
in
this
particular
case
is
that
when
a
state
court
invokes
the
federal
constitution
to
declare
a
statute
un-constitutional,
along
with
it
comes
the
obligation
to
use
the
chevron
standard
to
determine
whether
that
finding
should
be
retroactive.
other
than
that,
we
had
complied
with
every
facet
of
the
state
procedures
for
refunds.
mr.
david
g.
robertson
our
contention
is
that
historically
this
court,
not
only
in
criminal
cases
such
as
chapman,
but
also
in
civil
cases,
as
recently
as
allegheny
pittsburgh,
has
not
allowed
the
state
court
to
dictate
the
remedy
for
a
constitutional
violation
vis
a
vis
a
tax
statute.
rather,
the
court
has
required
the
state
to
follow
federal
equitable
standards
in
determining
whether
the
particular
decision
should
be
applied
retroactively
or
prospectively.
indeed,
right
now--
mr.
david
g.
robertson
--in
a
sense
to
go
back
to
the
words
of
bacchus,
the
federal
claim
and
the
state
remedy
are
intertwined,
and
in
each
particular
case,
the
state
court
has
to
be
sure
that
enforcing
the
federal
remedy
it
does
not
allow
the
state
remedy
procedure
to
collide
with
the
federal
constitutional
right
and
its
attendant
equitable
doctrine.
mr.
david
g.
robertson
we
think
as
the
court
decided
in
the
old
case
of
sunburst
that
a
state
court
has
an
absolute
right
to
use
any
retroactivity
standard
it
wants,
as
long
as
it
is
exclusively
deciding
an
issue
of
state
law.
but
once
a
state
court
begins
to
use
the
federal
constitution
to
enforce
federal
constitutional
principles,
then
the
court
should
look
to
the
federal
standard.
otherwise,
we
will
end
up
with
very
different
state
enforcing
very
different
standards,
and
utter
confusion
in
terms
of
whether
parties
who
pay
taxes
inter
and
intra-state
are
deserving
of
a
refund.
but
i
think
what
is
critical--
mr.
david
g.
robertson
--absolutely
not.
we
are
only
looking
for
equal
treatment.
we
are
only
looking
for
the
state
to
tax
us
at
exactly
the
same
rate
as
it
taxed
our
local
competitors,
and
that
is
why
we
are
not
asking
for
a
return
of
the
entire
tax.
far
from
it.
we
are
simply
saying
that
since,
in
this
particular
case,
florida
cannot
make
any
type
of
argument
whatsoever...
and
the
florida
has
not,
on
appeal,
tried
to
do
it...
that
their
decision
constituted
a
new
principle
of
law.
in
this
particular
case,
given
that
chevron's
first
prong
should
be
a
threshold
prong,
following
our
demonstration
that
their
decision,
which
relied
on
old
decisions
like
hunt
and
lewis
and
pike
and
bacchus...
you
know,
this
was
not
a
situation
where
they
were
confronting
a
new
situation.
they
were
applying
this
court's
oldest
commerce
clause
cases,
and
in
doing
that,
they
said
the
florida
legislature
once
again
has
overstepped
and
tried
to
extract
un-constitutional
taxes.
all
we
are
saying
is
that
since
the
court
did
not
have
to
create
a
new
principle
of
law
to
reach
that
finding,
they
cannot
invoke
any
type
of
retroactivity
doctrine.
they
fail
to
meet
chevron's
first
prong,
and
therefore
in
this
particular
situation
a
refund
of
the
un-constitutional
taxes
is
appropriate.
mr.
david
g.
robertson
first,
under
chevron's
three
prongs,
a
court
would
have
to
get
by
that
initial
prong,
because
after
all,
retroactivity
is
a
word--
mr.
david
g.
robertson
--exactly.
mr.
david
g.
robertson
let
me
speak
to
that.
this
is
not
a
case
like
bacchus.
mckesson
in
this
particular
case
suffered
a
significant
economic
injury,
and
the
florida
supreme
court
so
found.
mckesson's
products
were
competing
across
a
broad
spectrum,
with
the
local
producers'
products,
and
mckesson,
in
that
competitive
marketplace,
suffered--
mr.
david
g.
robertson
--we
have
two
answers
to
that.
the
first
is,
under
chevron's
first
prong,
the
court
should
not
reach
that,
because
florida,
after
all,
cannot
prove
that
it
justifiably
relied
upon
those
un-constitutional
statutes.
but
the
second
answer
is...
and
this
draws
back
to
some
of
the
court's
decisions
in
the
anti-trust
area...
it
does
not
make
sense,
as
it
did
not
make
sense
in
hanover
shoe,
to
allow
the
perpetrator,
the
state
extracting
un-constitutional
taxes,
or
the
anti-trust
violator...
to
force
the
victim
to
prove
the
amount
of
the
disruption
of
the
economic
market.
mr.
david
g.
robertson
that
is
correct.
we...
it
could
be
totally
different,
and
we
are
not
asking
for
damages.
we
are
only
asking
for
a
tax
refund.
mr.
david
g.
robertson
we
are
saying
that
in
this
case,
as
in
bacchus,
we
had
to
demonstrate
our
standing,
and
to
do
that,
we
established
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
florida
court
that
we
had
suffered
a
significant
economic
injury.
we
are
saying
that
once
we
have
established
that,
it
does
not
make
sense
for
the
state
to
turn
around
and
say,
"you
passed
it
on".
i
mean,
this
is
a
situation
where
the
legislature
was
intending
to
injure
us.
