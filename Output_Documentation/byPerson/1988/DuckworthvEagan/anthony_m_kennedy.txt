justice
kennedy
is
there
some
specific
origin
for
this
wording?
because
it's
apparently
been
used...
it's
come
up
in
a
couple
of
cases.
justice
kennedy
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
warning
is
factually
correct?
justice
kennedy
of
course,
isn't
the
reason
for
that
the
likelihood
that
once
he
had
the
attorney
he
wouldn't
answer
questions
anyway?
justice
kennedy
that's
not
devious.
it's
just
the
real
world.
once...
once
an
attorney
is
on
the
scene,
it's
unlikely
that
he's
going
to
make
a
statement.
justice
kennedy
well,
in
that
view
would
you
say
that
it's
preferable
that
this
additional
statement
be
given
in
all
miranda
warnings?
justice
kennedy
why?
justice
kennedy
well,
why
does
i
cause
unnecessary...
well,
we're
here
now.
should
we...
should
we
say
that
it's
preferable?
justice
kennedy
well,
what
is
the
government's
view?
that
this
is
preferable
or
not
preferable?
should
we
add
this
to
the
miranda
one?
justice
kennedy
well,
if
this
is
factually
correct,
why
not
add
it.
justice
kennedy
under
the
view
you're
propounding,
you
would
require
reversal
even
if
the
standard
miranda
warning
were
given.
justice
kennedy
you're
opening
statement
to
us
was
that
interrogation
may
not
proceed
unless
there
exists
a
mechanism
for
giving
a
lawyer
if
requested.
justice
kennedy
and
if
that
mechanism
doesn't
exist
in
indiana,
then
even
the
standard
miranda
warning
won't
suffice.
justice
kennedy
suppose
we
assume
there
is
no
ability
to
produce
an
attorney
for
all
interrogations
and
for
this
one
in
indiana
if
requested,
and
suppose
further
a
standard
miranda
warning
is
given,
what
result?
justice
kennedy
suppose
in
this
case
the
standard
miranda
warning
were
given
and
the
suspect
then
says,
"well,
if
i
wanted
a
counsel
right
now,
could
i
get
one?
"
and
the
police
said,
"well,
as
a
practical
matter,
no,
but
you
don't
have
to
answer
any
questions
until
you
get
one.
"
and
he
said,
"well,
i
might
as
well
go
ahead
and
answer.
"
what
then?
justice
kennedy
there
is
no...
they
are
just
describing
reality.
justice
kennedy
that's
all
they're
doing.
justice
kennedy
it's
not
an
unconstitutional
procedure
if
he
waives.
that's
circular.
justice
kennedy
you
see,
you're
asking
us
in
effect
to
hold
something
unconstitutional
when
it's
factually
accurate.
and
that's
rather
difficult.
