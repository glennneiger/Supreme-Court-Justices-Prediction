justice
o'connor
is
that
because
of
the...
the
only
problem
in
the
view
of
the
court
below
was
this
language
of
"we
have
no
way
of
giving
you
a
lawyer
but
one
will
be
appointed
for
you,
if
you
wish,
if
and
when
you
go
to
court?
"
justice
o'connor
what
language
is
used
now
instead
of
that?
justice
o'connor
well,
isn't--
--if
an
attorney
is
to
be
provided,
it's
provided
only
at
the
time
that
the
person
charged
goes
to
court
and
enters
the
plea
and
says,
"i
need
counsel"?
justice
o'connor
at
arraignment?
justice
o'connor
first
appearance.
well,
does
that
comply
with
constitutional
standard?
justice
o'connor
--and
then
counsel
is
appointed.
and
then
you
question
him.
is
that
what
happens?
justice
o'connor
well,
this
is
factually
correct
in
the
state
of
indiana.
justice
o'connor
and
presumably
some
other
states
that
don't
appoint
until
there's
a
first
appearance
in
court
for
an
indigent.
justice
o'connor
well,
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
warning
he
was
given
said,
"you
have
the
right
to
the
advise
and
presence
of
a
lawyer
even
if
you
can't
afford
to
hire
one.
"
justice
o'connor
that's
pretty
clear.
justice
o'connor
the
second
sentence
says,
"we
have
no
way
of
giving
you
one,
but
one
will
be
appointed
for
you
if
you
wish
if
and
when
you
go
to
court.
"
now,
that's
technically
correct,
isn't
it?
justice
o'connor
well,
didn't
miranda
itself
in
the
opinion
say
there
is
no
requirement
the
state
have
a
station-house
lawyer
present
to
advise
people?
justice
o'connor
but
as
i
read
this
warning,
it
is
in
all
respects
accurate.
justice
o'connor
and
it
meets
with
the
requirements
we
laid
down
in
the
miranda
decision.
justice
o'connor
well,
this
court
in
oregon
v.
elstead
said
that...
and
other
cases
too...
said
that
a
defect
in
miranda
warnings
does
not
in
and
of
itself
constitute
a
violation
of
the
constitution.
justice
o'connor
and
we're
here
on
federal
habeas.
justice
o'connor
i'm
wondering
why
we
should
even
consider
a
claim
like
this
on
federal
habeas.
i
mean,
it
isn't
a
violation
of
the
constitution.
he's
not
being
held
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
why
should
we
even
entertain
this
on--
justice
o'connor
--well,
as
i
said,
we've
held
in
oregon
against
elstad
that
it's
not
a
fifth
amendment
violation.
justice
o'connor
well,
the
seventh
circuit
went
off
on
the
ground
that
this
was
some
kind
of
deviation
from
the
miranda
warning.
justice
o'connor
that's
exactly
what
they
went
off
on.
i
just...
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
why
we
should
entertain
it
at
all
on
habeas.
justice
o'connor
well,
the
warning
goes
on.
"you
have
a
right
to
stop
answering
at
any
time
until
you
talk
to
a
lawyer.
"
"you
have
the
right
to
stop
answering
questions
at
any
time.
"
"you
have
the
right
to
advise
and
presence
of
a
lawyer
even
if
you
can't
afford
to
hire
one.
"
gee,
it
seems
to
me
the
seventh
circuit
and
you
are
reading
a
lot
into
this
warning
that
isn't
there.
justice
o'connor
well,
now,
in
this
case
i
take
it
mr.
eagan
signed,
as
part
of
the
miranda
warning
that
was
first
given--
justice
o'connor
--a
waiver--
justice
o'connor
--in
which
he
says,
"i
understand
what
my
rights
are.
"
"i
am
willing
to
answer
questions
and
make
a
statement.
"
"i
do
not
want
a
lawyer.
"
"i
understand
and
know
what
i
am
doing.
"
and
so
forth.
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
so,
he
said
affirmatively,
"i
do
not
want
a
lawyer.
"
that's
part
of
the
waiver
that's
signed
before--
justice
o'connor
--questioning?
