mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
united
states,
the
state
of
indiana,
and
respondent,
all
agree
that
under
this
court's
decision
in
miranda
against
arizona
that
police
must
inform
a
suspect
who
is
in
custody
of
his
right
to
consult
with
a
lawyer
before
any
questioning
begins.
the
question
presented
here
is
not
whether
a
suspect
must
be
so
warned
but
rather
what
form
that
warning
may
take.
more
precisely,
whether
advising
the
suspect
that
he
has
the
right
to
the
advise
and
presence
of
counsel
before
any
questioning,
but
also
that
a
lawyer
will
be
appointed
if
and
when
he
goes
to
court
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
miranda.
in
our
view,
such
warnings,
taken
as
a
whole,
do
adequately
inform
an
indigent
suspect
of
his
right
to
consult
with
a
lawyer
before
any
questioning.
here
the
initial
set
of
warnings
given
to
respondent
conveyed
all
the
rights
required
by
the
miranda
decision.
the
hammond
detectives
told
respondent
that
he
had
the
right
to
remain
silent,
that
he
had
the
right
to
the
advise
and
to
consult
with
a
lawyer,
that
he
had
the
right
to
have
a
lawyer
present
during
any
questioning,
and
that
he
had
this
right
to
the
advise
and
presence
of
a
lawyer
even
if
he
could
not
afford
to
hire
one.
the
court
of
appeals
concluded,
however,
that
providing
respondent
with
the
additional
piece
of
information
that
a
lawyer
would
be
appointed
it
and
when
he
goes
to
court
rendered
the
warnings
inadequate.
the
court
of
appeals
is
found
two
reasons
for
that
holding.
first,
according
to
the
court
of
appeals,
that,
statement
suggested
that
only
those
persons
who
could
afford
a
lawyer
had
the
right
to
have
a
lawyer
present
before
any
questioning.
and,
second,
that
challenged
statement
suggested
that
indigent
suspects
are
not
entitled
to
a
lawyer
at
all
either
before
or
during
questioning
if
charges
were
not
filed.
in
our
view,
the
court
of
appeals
was
mistaken
on
both
grounds.
the
challenged
statement
simply
explained
the
mechanics
of
appointing
counsel.
the
previous
two
warnings...
that
respondent
had
the
right
to
speak
with
a
lawyer
before
any
questioning,
that
he
had
the
right
to
the
presence
of
that
lawyer
during
questioning,
and
that
he
had
this
right
to
the
advise
and
presence
of
counsel
even
if
he
could
not
afford
to
hire
a
lawyer...
made
clear
that
whether
respondent
could
afford
to
hire
a
lawyer
or
not,
he
had
the
right
not
to
be
questioned
until
a
lawyer...
until
he
had
the
chance
to
talk
with
a
lawyer.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
no.
in
fact,
as
we...
as
the
court
is
aware
of
the
litigation
that
went
on
during
the
early
'70s,
in
this
case
itself,
the
federal
government
does
not
use
warnings
like
this.
no,
we
do
not
prefer
to
have
this
language
in
there
because--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--it
causes
unnecessary
litigation.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
we
don't
think
the
court
has
to
decide
whether
it's
preferable
or
not.
the
question
presented
is
whether
this
warning...
providing
this
additional
statement
renders
the
warnings
inadequate.
or,
another
way
of
looking
at
it,
whether
these
warnings
comply
with
miranda.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
no.
our
position
is
the
warnings
that
the
court
laid
down
in
miranda
itself
are
fine.
they
are--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--because
it's
not
factually
correct
in
every
jurisdiction.
for
example,
in
the
federal
system
you
can
have
a
lawyer
appointed
before
your
initial
appearance.
and
in
response
to
the
question
before,--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--in
the
state
of
indiana
this
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
yes.
and,
in
fact,
to
be
perfectly
candid
the
statement
is
accurate.
and,
actually,
it's
accurate
in
any
jurisdiction
in
the
sense
that...
in
not
any,
but
most...
in
the
sense
that
you
have
to
go
to
court
first.
that's
who
appoints
the
lawyer.
even
in
the
federal
system
the
magistrate
of
the
judge
appoints
the
lawyer.
but
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question
before,
it
is
possible
in
the
federal
system
to
have
a
lawyer
before
the
formal
charging
process.
although,
if
you
read
the
criminal
justice
act
precisely,
it
doesn't
automatically
cover
it.
but
in
practice
if
the
police...
for
example,
if
fbi
agents
arrest
a
suspect
and
they
bring
him
down
and
read
him
his
miranda
warnings,
he
says,
"look,
i'd
like
a
lawyer
before
i
talk
to
you.
"
what
the
agents
will
do
or
should
do,
and
have
done
it
in
practice,
is
they
call
up
either
the
assistant.
u.s.
attorney
on
duty
or
the
magistrate
himself
and
say,
"listen,
we
have
a
man
here
in
custody.
"
"he'd
like
a
lawyer.
"
and
you
bring
him
to
the
magistrate
and
you
give
him
a
lawyer,
if
he
qualifies
under
the
cja.
and
in
response
to
justice
kennedy's
question
before,
it's
not...
although
in
practice
many
suspects
will
no
longer
talk
once
they
have
a
lawyer,
in
the
situation
which
justice
stevens'
posited,
depending
on
the
facts
of
the
case,
it
might
be
in
everyone's
interest,
especially
the
person
who
is
in
custody,
once
he's
talked
to
a
lawyer
to
continue
the
questioning
in
the
sense
that
he
just
might
be
a
material
witness
and
he's
not
at
all
suspected
of
any
crime.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
it
can
be
done
ahead
of
time
in
the
sense
that...
at
least
my
experience
in
philadelphia
in
the
federal
system...
the
federal
defendant
program
is
always
available,
and
when
the
person
was
taken
into
custody,
two
calls
would
be
made.
the
agents
would
call
the
united
states
attorney's
office
and
would
also
call
the
defenders
and
say
we
have
someone
in
our
custody
who
we
think
will
qualify
for
your
services.
and
it's
done...
it's
done
routinely.
indiana,
according
to
the
briefs,
does
not
have
that
system.
and,
again,
that
system
is
not
constitutionally
required.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
yes,
chief
justice.
and,
in
fact,
our
position
in
this
case
is
what
i
stated
up
front.
which
is,
as
long
as
the
warnings
convey
the
rights
required
by
the
miranda
decision
and
are
not
completely
misleading
or
confusing,
then
the
warning
has
complied
with
miranda.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
no,
obviously
it
did
not.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
i
have
no
firsthand
knowledge
of
how
indiana--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--it
makes
no
sense.
it's
very
easy,
after
the
decision
is
reported,
to
rip
it
up.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
or
to
seek
further
review.
that
was
not
done.
from
reading
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
you
can
read
between
the
lines
and
the
court
of
appeals
was
somewhat
irked
by
that.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
well,
it
was
a
seventh
circuit
decision.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
that's
true.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
and,
in
fact,
the
indiana
supreme
court
has
taken
the
view
that
warnings
such
as
this
are...
do
comply
with
miranda.
so,
there
is
some...
there
might
be
some
reason
why
the
hammond
police
department
wanted
to
stick
with
their
guns.
but
we
do
not
know
that.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
finally,
one
final
point
with
respect
to
the
compliance
or
whether
prysock
calls
for
a
different
result.
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
and
perhaps
respondent
himself
have
somehow
overstated
prysock.
the
court's
decision
in
prysock
simply
suggested
that
warnings
would
be
inadequate
if
the
warning's
lengthy
appointment
of
counsel
was
at
a
future
point
in
time
after
police
interrogation.
if
you
read
the
lower
court's
opinion
that
this
court
cited
in
prysock,
the
problem
with
those
warnings
in
the
belinsky
case
and
the
garcia
case
was
that
the
suspect
was
never
told
that
he
had
the
right
to
talk
to
a
lawyer
before
questioning.
they
just
weren't
told
for
some
reason.
here
we
have
no
doubt
that
respondent
was
told
that.
he
was
told
that
several
times.
and
so
prysock
doesn't
call
for
the
result
that
respondent
or
the
court
of
appeals
suggested.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
