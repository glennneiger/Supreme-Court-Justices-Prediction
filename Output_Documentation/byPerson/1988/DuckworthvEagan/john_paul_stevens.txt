justice
stevens
--mr.
wallman,
what
do
they
do
in
indiana
if
the
suspect
says,
"yeah,
i'd
be
glad
to
talk
to
you.
"
"i
don't
have
any
money
so
i
can't
hire
a
lawyer,
but
i'd
like
to
have
a
lawyer
present
while
we
talk?
"
would
you--
justice
stevens
--well,
i
understand...
if
you
continued.
but
do
you
just
say,
"well,
i'm
sorry.
"
"we
can't
get
you
a
lawyer
so
we
won't
ask
you
any
questions
then?
"
isn't
there
any
provision
for
finding
a
counsel
for
a
man
in
that
position
so
you
can
go
ahead
and
complete
the
interrogation.
justice
stevens
no,
i
didn't
say
that
demands
it.
well,
i
thought
your
response
was
you
wait
until
the
first
appearance--
justice
stevens
yes.
but
what
if
you
don't,
have
probable
cause?
so
you
can't
get
an
indictment
against
him.
but
you're
pretty
sure...
i
mean,
you
have
a
good
hunch
that
if
he
tells
you
the
whole
story,
you'd
then
be
able
to
go
ahead.
your
hands
are
tied
under
your
procedure?
justice
stevens
no,
i
understand--
justice
stevens
--you
can't
accept
the
statement.
but
you
also...
as
a
matter
of
indiana
law
you
can't
find
a
lawyer
who
would
be
willing
to
represent
him?
justice
stevens
yeah,
but
you
don't
have
any
procedure
for
dealing
with
that
situation.
justice
stevens
in
the
federal
system
do
you
ever
go
to
the
federal
defender
program
directly?
or,
say,
it's
late
at
night
or
something
and
a
magistrate
isn't
available,
is
there
any...
do
you
ever
short-circuit
this
problem?
justice
stevens
do
you
think
this
warning
complied
with
the
seventh
circuit
decision
in
williams
against
toomey?
justice
stevens
how
do
you
explain
indiana
continuing
to
use
a
form
that
had
been
specifically
held
improper
by
the
seventh
circuit
even
if
the
seventh
circuit
was
wrong?
justice
stevens
because
apparently
it's
a
printed
form
they
used.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
in
that,
"i
have
read
or
had
read
to
me.
"
you're
supposed
to
cross
out
and
you
didn't
cross
out
one
of
them
there,
did
you?
justice
stevens
he
had
done
both?
justice
stevens
and
when
they
read
it
to
him,
did
they
read
the
waiver
language
too?
justice
stevens
he
read
it
himself?
