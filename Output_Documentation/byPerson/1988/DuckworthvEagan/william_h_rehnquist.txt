chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
88-317
in
jack
r.
duckworth
versus
gary
james
eagan.
we'll
wait
just
a
minute,
mr.
wallman,
until
the
noise
settles
down
a
little.
very
well,
mr.
wallman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallman.
mr.
lazerwitz.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
know,
there's
no
reason
why
we
have
to
pick
and
choose
among
permissible
miranda
warnings,
is
there?
the
miranda
opinion
itself
left
open
the
possibility
of
any
actual
warning.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lazerwitz.
mr.
eisenberg.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that
comes
up
only
when
there
is
an
interrogation.
indiana
can
say,
if
somebody
chooses
to
elect
his
right
to
have
a
lawyer
present
during
interrogation,
we
can't
furnish
you
a
lawyer,
so
they'll
be
no
interrogation.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that
isn't
what
the
seventh
circuit
said.
they
said
the
warning
was
inadequate.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
a
defendant
in
custody
can
vindicate
his
miranda
warnings
by
saying,
"i
will
not
respond
to
questions
unless
there
is
a
lawyer
present.
"
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
he
should
say,
"i
won't
answer
questions".
he
didn't
say
that.
he
answered
them.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that's
all
miranda
requires.
chief
justice
rehnquist
where
does
it
say
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
where?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that's
all
miranda
requires.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
wasn't
a
holding
in
miranda.
all
of
miranda
was
dicta.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what's
that
got
to
do
with
the
merits
of
the
case
now
it's
in
this
court?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
could
at
any
time
say
the
seventh
circuit's
decision
was
wrong.
chief
justice
rehnquist
people
would
get
out
on
habeas
because
the
seventh
circuit
has--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--but
i
don't
see
why
it's
such
an
affront,
as
you
seem
to
say,
that
they
should
not
have
followed
seventh
circuit
in
this
issue
if
they
felt
it
was
wrong.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
there
were
differences
of
opinion
in
the
courts,
were
there
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
because
they
think
it's
all
right,
i
suppose.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
don't
know.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
eisenberg.
mr.
wallman,
you
have
nine
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallman.
the
case
is
submitted.
