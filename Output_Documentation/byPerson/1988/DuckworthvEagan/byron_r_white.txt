a
pretty
good
reason.
justice
white
of
course,
even
if
you're
right
that
this
is
defensible
under
miranda,
it's
also
true
that
you
might
avoid
some
litigation
by
changing
the
miranda
warning
a
little
bit.
justice

unless
you
think...
unless
you
think
there's
really
some
advantages
to
this
formulation.
justice
white
what
do
they
do
in
this
jurisdiction...
when
they
give
them
this
particular
miranda
warning?
then
what
happens?
what
do
they
say,
"do
you
waive
your
right
to
counsel
at
interrogation?
"
justice
white
do
they
say,
"do
you
understand"?
or
do
they
just
say...
just
go
right
ahead
and...
if
he
doesn't...
if
he
just
remains
silent
or--
justice
white
--but
then
what?
then
what?
is
that
the
end
of
it?
justice
white
how
do
you
know?
do
you
just
ask
him
a
question?
justice
white
he
never
says,
"i
waive",
or
anything
like
that?
he
just--
justice
white
--"do
you
have
any
questions"?
and
he's
silent.
and
he
doesn't
say,
"i
want
to
remain
silent.
"
"he
just
is
silent.
"
"and
so
then
you
start
questioning
him.
"
well,
then
he
signs
the
document
and--
--oh,
he
signs
the
document.
what
does
it
say?
justice
white
okay.
justice
white
well,
it
certainly
doesn't
mean
that.
he
doesn't
waive
his
right
to
counsel--
justice
white
--he's
waiving
his
right
to
counsel
ate
the
time
of
the
interview?
