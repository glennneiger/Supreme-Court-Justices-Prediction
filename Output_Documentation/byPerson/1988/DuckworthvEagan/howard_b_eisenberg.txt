mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
miranda
this
court
said
that
in
order
for
a
suspect
to
properly
waive
his
right
to
counsel
at
a
custodial
interrogation
the
police
must
tell
him
that
he
has
the
right
to
counsel
before
and
during
the
interrogation,
and
the
suspect
must
knowingly
and
intelligently
waive
the
right
to
counsel.
in
this
case,
eagan
was
never
told
that
he
had
the
right
to
counsel
at
the
interrogation,
he
could
not
knowingly
or
intelligently
waive
that
right
because
he
was
told
by
the
hammond
police
that
he
had
no
such
right.
in
fact,
the
police
affirmatively
told
him
that
the
right
to
counsel
in
that
jurisdiction
did
not
attach
until
he
came
to
court
for
the
first
time.
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
yes.
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
not
when
the
entire
admonition
is
read.
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
it
is
factually
correct;
it
is
constitutionally
deficient.
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
we
don't
advocate
a
station-house
attorney
justice
o'connor.
what
we
do
say
is
that
in
order
to
interrogate
a
suspect,
you
must
have
a
mechanism
for
complying
with
miranda.
and
it
is
no
answer
to
say,
well,
indiana
has
elected
not
to
file
a
miranda
and
not
to
provide
counsel.
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
it's
factually
accurate
in
that--
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
--i
respectfully
disagree.
miranda
requires
that
counsel
be
made
available
to
the
suspect
at
the
time
of
the
interrogation.
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
that's
right.
and
had
they
not
interrogated
eagan,
this
case
would
not
be
here.
but
they
did
interrogate
eagan.
twenty-three
years
after
miranda
they
continue
to
interrogate
suspects
in
custody
without
the
ability
to
comply
with
the
basic
requirement
of
provision
of
counsel.
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
yes.
they
said
that
the
warning
is
ambiguous
because
it
first
says
you
have
the
right
to
counsel,
but
then
says
you
don't
have
the
right
to
counsel
at
the
interrogation,
that
you
only
have
the
right
to
counsel
at
the
time
you
come
to
court.
and
it
is
my
submission--
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
--that's
right,
mr.
chief
justice,
he
can.
but
here
this
person
was
told
i
can't
have
a
lawyer
there.
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
well,
yes.
maybe
you
and
i
would
agree
that
if
he'd
viewed
those--
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
--miranda,
respectfully,
mr.
chief
justice,
requires
that
there
be
an
ability
to
provide
counsel
or
there
will
be
no
interrogation.
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
your
honor,
the
court
said
there--
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
--at
page
475,
this
court
cited
the
language
in
connolly
v.
cochran,
saying
there
must
be
an
offer
of
counsel
at
the
interrogation,
and
a
valid
waiver.
they
did--
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
--if
there
is
an
interrogation.
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
i
think
that's
right.
that
is
one
way
he
could
do
it.
but
here--
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
--well,
i--
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
--no,
justice
kennedy,
that's
not
my--
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
--that's
right.
or
they
have--
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
--miranda
represents
a
balancing
between
the
interests
of
the
prosecution
and
the
interests
of
the
defendant.
when
you
give
the
proper
warnings,
that
tells
him
that
he
has
the
ability
to
get
an
attorney.
and
if
he
asks
for
counsel,
this
court
has
taught
that
he
cannot
any
longer
be
interrogated.
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
the
confession
is
admissible
because
you
have
to
look
at
what
was
told
to
the
suspect.
and
that's
exactly
what
the
seventh
circuit
said.
that
the
warning
eagan
was
given
was
at
best
contradictory,
and
i
submit
at
worst
it
told
him
he
did
not
have
the
right
to
counsel
at
the
interrogation.
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
that's
correct.
that's
right.
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
yes.
absolutely.
and,
in
fact,
it
is
my
submission,
justice
marshall,
that
really
what
the
government
here
and
the
state
of
indiana
advocates
is
backtracking
on
that
explicit
holding
in
miranda
that
counsel
be
made
available.
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
well,
i
suppose
that's
true
to
some
extent.
but
the
court
said
that
in
order
to
overcome
the
inherently
coercive
atmosphere
of
custodial
interrogation
the
defendant
must
be
afforded
counsel
or
must
waive
counsel.
and
that's
when
the
court
said
it
must
be
offered
and
the
offer
must
be
rejected.
now,
this
court
has
also
said
that
the
rules...
the
warnings
themselves
are
not
constitutional
rules
and
that
no
specific
language
need
be
used.
that's
absolutely
correct.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
here
they
told
eagan
he
couldn't
have
a
lawyer
at
the
interrogation.
that's
exactly
the
opposite
of
what
miranda
says.
and
while
the
warnings
certainly
are
not
written
in
stone
or
even
constitutionally
required,
here
it
was
just
the
inverse
of
miranda
that
this
man
was
told.
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
that's
right.
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
because
his
constitutional
right
to
self-incrimination
was
violated
under
the
rationale
of
miranda,
which
says
that
unless
the
suspect
is
informed
of
his
right
to
counsel
at
the
time
of
the
interrogation
and
waives
that,
the
fifth
amendment
is
violated.
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
well,
i
read
oregon
and
elstad,
justice
o'connor,
to
mean
that
deviation
from
the
traditional
miranda
warnings
do
not
constitute
a
constitutional
violation.
i
had
thought
and
i
assert
that
if
counsel
is
not
made
available
at
the
time
of
the
interrogation--
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
--well--
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
--because
it
is
more
than
just
a
deviation
of
words.
it's
more
than
just
a
semantical
difference.
it
is
an
assertion
that
there
is
no
right
to
counsel
at
the
time
of
the
interrogation.
this
isn't
like
prysock
where
you
said,
well,
you
have
to
have
a
counsel
appointed,
or
you
may
have
to
wait
an
hour
before
counsel
gets
here.
it
is
my
submission
that
they
told
him
counsel
could
not
be
made
available.
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
well,
justice
o'connor,
i
think
that
the
reasonable
understanding
of
those
words
were
that
this
man
had
no
ability
to
obtain
counsel
before
or
during
the
interrogation.
and
that
burden's
his
fifth
amendment
right
as
identified
in
miranda.
and
that
is
the
constitutional
deprivation
here.
the
deprivation
isn't
whether
they
used
the
word
"appointment"
as
opposed
to
some
other
word.
the
problem
with
this
warning
is
that
it
violated
the
right
to
counsel
under
the
fifth
amendment
established
in
miranda.
and
that's
why
it
is
here
and
that's
this
court
should
resolve
the
question
on
federal
habeas.
this
is
not
just
some
semantical
deviation.
this
is,
in
my
mind,
the
repudiation
of
a
basic
principle
found
in
the
miranda
decision.
in
terms
of
what
this
means,
the
courts
have
divided
almost
equally.
and
while
the
respondent
and
the
petitioner
disagree
as
to
what
those
cases
say,
several
things
are
absolutely
true.
number
one,
no
matter
what
you
say,
this
warning
is
not
clear
in
terms
of
the
right
to
counsel.
number
two,
this
warning
came
ten
years
after
the
seventh
circuit
had
held
verbatim
these
warnings
to
be
defective.
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
well,
i
think
it
does
have
some
relevance
here.
well,
obviously
this
court
can
now
say
that
the
seventh
circuit's
'72
decision
was
wrong.
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
and,
indeed,
they
have.
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
that's
right.
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
my
submission
is
that
they
have
to
provide
counsel
in
the
way
that
miranda
requires.
the
seventh
circuit
ten
years
earlier
had
said
that
this
specific
warning
was
wrong.
indiana
continued
to
use
this,
continued
to
use
language
that
was
not
the
standard
warning.
they
gave...
they
gave
a
different
warning
the
date
after
these
warnings
to
the
same
man,
the
same
police
department.
my
submission
is
this
is
not
some
deviation
because
indiana
has
some
unique...
unique
way
of
providing
counsel.
this
is
an
instruction
designed
to
obtain
statements
in
violation
of
miranda.
and
that's
why
this
is
important,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
is
not
something
about
which
courts
had
not
spoken
prior
to
1982
when
eagan
gave
this
statement.
and
it
strikes
me
as
strange--
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
--there
certainly
were.
but
the
seventh
circuit
had
ruled...
and
while
you're
absolutely
correct,
obviously,
that
the
indiana
supreme
court
could
deviate
from
it,
why
do
they
continue
to
give
this
instruction?
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
they
why
did
they
give
a
different
instruction
the
next
day?
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
well,
the
record
suggests--
[laughter]
the
record
suggest
that
the
reason
they
did
that...
the
officer
who
testified
at
the
suppression
hearing
said,
"well,
we
didn't
think
miranda
at
all
was
required
before
the
first
statement.
"
"and
then
the
second
statement
we
gave
him
the
somewhat
better
warning
because
miranda
was
required.
"
so,
i
don't
think
it's
entirely
clear
that
the
state
uses
this
"if
and
when"
warning
because
they
can't
provide
counsel.
my
submission
is
that
they
use
it
in
order
to
obtain
statements
that
violate
miranda
or
where
they
view
a
miranda
as
not
being
applicable,
and
particularly
after
this
court's
decision
in
california
v.
prysock.
in
california
v.
prysock,
the
suspect
was
informed
of
his
right
to
counsel
and
then
told
that
the
court
would
have
to
appoint
a
lawyer
for
him.
and
this...
the
majority
of
the
courts
said
that
was
fine
because
it
did
not
link
the
appointment
of
counsel
to
some
future
event.
he
could
have
had
the
court
appoint
the
lawyer
at
that
time
and
place
at
the
interrogation.
and
if
you
look
at
how
courts
have
construed
the
prysock
decision,
it
is
that
the
first
set
of
warnings
given
eagan
were
invalid
because
they
linked
the
appointment
of
counsel
to
some
future
event.
that
is,
the
ultimate
and
conditional...
the
possible
appearance
in
court.
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
that's
a
closer
case.
i
would
submit
that
the
statement
would
still
not
be
admissible
because
it
is
conditioned
on
an
event
after
interrogation.
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
well--
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
--an
accurate
description
of
an
unconstitutional
procedure
doesn't
make
it
proper,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
if
you--
mr.
howard
b.
eisenberg
--you
can
waive
counsel
but
only
after
knowingly
being
informed
of
what
your
rights
are.
and
the
rights
established
my
miranda
include
the
right
to
counsel
at
the
interrogation.
in
my
brief
i
cite
a
recent
decision
of
the
illinois
supreme
court,
justice
kennedy,
which
comes
close
to
the
facts
you've
suggested.
there
the
suspect
was
informed
of
his
right
to
counsel
and
he
says,
"do
you
mean
i
can
have
a
lawyer
here
at
the
interrogation?
"
and
the
police
said
to
him,
"yes,
we
can
call
the
public
defender,
but
it
will
take
a
little
while.
"
that
was
found
acceptable
and
i
think
that
is
perfectly...
a
perfectly
appropriate
result.
the
question
you
have
asked
comes
closer
than
the
instant
case.
saying,
"well,
you
can't
get
one
until
you
go
to
court.
"
had
they
said
you
can't
get
one
until
we
call
the
public
defender,
that,
the
illinois
court
said
was
all
right,
and
i
submit
that
there
is
the
distinction
between
the
weight
that
is
always
going
to
be
required
to
obtain
counsel
and
conditioning
the
right
to
counsel
on
a
future
event.
and
that
is
the
line
this
court
drew
in
prysock,
and
that
is
my
submission
as
to
where
the
court
should
appropriately
draw
the
line
here.
turning
briefly
to
the
second
admonition,
again,
this
was
given
the
next
day
by
the
same
police
department
after
the
police
had
interrogated
the
complaining
witness,
the
victim
in
this
case.
again,
the
warnings
did
not
comply
with
the
traditional
miranda
warnings.
but
they
were
different.
the
same
police
department
gave
different
warnings
the
day
after
the
"if
and
when
warnings".
these
told
him
that
he
had
the
right
to
a
counsel
of
his
choosing
at
the
interrogation.
and
then
they
told
him
later
that
if
he
was
indigent,
counsel
could
be
appointed
to
represent
him
at
that
time.
the
seventh
circuit
remanded
this
case
for
a
determination
as
to
whether
the
second
set
of
warnings
saved
the
second
and
that
incriminating
statement.
and
i
submit
to
you
that
that
is
the
appropriate
relief.
as
i've
noted
in
my
brief,
the
transcript
of
the
suppression
hearing
was
not
produced
until
after
the
oral
argument.
it
was
never
made
part
of
the
record
on
appeal
in
either...
in
the
seventh
circuit.
and
when
one
looks
at
the
explicit
four
corners
of
the
second
set
of
warnings,
it
is
clear
that
these,
too,
reasonably
can
be
read
to
have
conditioned
his
ability
to
have
counsel
at
the
time
of
the
interrogation
on
his
ability
to
retain
a
lawyer.
and,
in
any
event,
looking
at
the
first
and
second
sets
together,
coming
as
they
do
one
day
apart,
it
is
my
submission
that
again
he
was
never
given
information
regarding
the
clear
right
to
counsel.
and
this
takes
the
case
out
of
oregon
v.
elstad
where
there
was
a
complete
and
accurate
miranda
warning
given
prior
to
the
second
admonition.
it
is
our
submission
in
this
case,
your
honors,
that
the
seventh
circuit
granted
very
modest
relief.
that
is,
to
suppress
the
exculpatory
statement
and
to
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
a
determination
of
the
admissibility
of
the
incriminating
statement.
i
believe
that
we
have
shown
that
the
miranda
decision
requires
the
provision
of
counsel
at
the
time
of
the
interrogation,
that
the
warnings
given
to
eagan
prior
to
the
first
interrogation
did
not
give
him
the
right,
did
not
inform
him
of
that
right,
and,
therefore,
his
waiver
was
not
knowing,
not
intelligent,
and
the
statement
was
properly
suppressed
by
the
seventh
circuit.
we
ask
that
the
judgment
of
that
court
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
