mr.
david
michael
wallman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
raises
two
issues
in
regard
to
two
separate
mirandas
utilized
by
the
hammond
police
department
to
effectuate
an
arrest
in
1982.
the
second
issue
raised
in
our
cert
petition
this
court
will
not
address
or
does
not...
has
no
need
to
address
unless
you
find
against
the
petitioning
state
in
regard
to
the
first
issue.
the
material
facts
in
this
case
are
relatively
simple
and
not
in
serious
dispute
and
are
easily
summarized.
in
the
early...
or,
the
evening
hours
of
may
the
16th
of
1982
the
respondent,
gary
eagan,
along
with
some
male
friends,
took
a
female
victim
from
chicago
across
the
state
line
to
hammond,
indiana.
there
they
engaged
in
sexual
activities
with
her
which
culminated
in
respondent
eagan
hitting
her
with
a
brick,
stabbing
her
several
times,
leaving
her
at
the
scene
naked
and
presumably
dead.
when
respondent
returned
to
chicago,
he
contacted
a
police
officer
friend
of
his
and
fabricated
a
story
as
to
finding
a
dead
woman
on
the
beach,
took
the
police...
or,
the
chicago
police
officer
across
the
state
line
to
indiana,
to
the
scene
of
the
crime
where
they
found
the
victim
who
obviously
was
not
dead,
and
at
the
scene
she
identified
him
and
said,
"why
did
you
stab
me
several
times?
"
the
chicago...
the
hammond
police
met
eagan
and
the
chicago
police
at
the
scene,
at
which
point
mr.
eagan
returned
to
the
hammond
police
station
and
at
11:14
on
may
the
17th
of
1982,
after
being
given
a
miranda,
the
miranda
at
issue
here,
made
an
exculpatory
statement,
in
essence
repeating
the
story
he
had
fabricated
for
the
chicago
police.
the
warning
at
issue
here
can
be
briefly
read
as
follows.
"before
we
ask
you
any
questions
you
must
understand
your
rights.
"
"you
have
the
right
to
remain
silent.
"
"anything
you
say
can
be
used
against
you
in
court.
"
"you
have
the
right
to
talk
to
a
lawyer
for
advise
before
we
ask
you
any
questions
and
to
have
him
with
you
during
questioning.
"
"you
have
this
right
to
the
advise
and
presence
of
a
lawyer
even
if
you
cannot
afford
to
hire
one.
"
"we
have
no
way
of
giving
you
a
lawyer,
but
one
will
be
appointed
for
you,
if
you
wish,
if
and
when
you
go
to
court.
"
"if
you
wish
to
answer
questions
now
without
a
lawyer
present,
you
have
the
right
to
stop
answering
questions
at
any
time.
"
"you
also
have
the
right
to
stop
answering
at
any
time
until
you
talk
to
a
lawyer.
"
this
warning
was
read
by
mr.
eagan,
was
read
to
mr.
eagan.
he
did
at
the
time
indicate
that
he
had
no
misunderstandings
about
it,
at
which
point
he
gave
the
exculpatory
statement.
the
seventh
circuit
decided
this
miranda
was
unduly
confusing
and
was
in
violation
of
an
earlier
1972
case
that
they
had
issued.
the
circuit
was
somehow
concerned--
mr.
david
michael
wallman
--that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
yes.
in
our
view,
the--
mr.
david
michael
wallman
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
not
after
the
seventh
circuit
case,
i'm
not
sure
in
hammond.
i
don't...
i
don't
know
if
it's
being
used
anywhere
else.
the
hammond
police
officer
did
use
it
here.
mr.
david
michael
wallman
well,
apparently
it
was
utilized
after
the
'72
decision
or
we
wouldn't
have
this
case.
the
hammond
police
department
did
utilize
it
then.
the
'72
decision
was
an
illinois
case,
i
might
add.
mr.
david
michael
wallman
the...
the...
i
frankly
don't
know
what
hammond
does
in
that
regard.
i
do
know
that
they
were
aware
of
what
the
seventh
circuit
did
in
this
case
and
have
adopted
another
miranda.
mr.
david
michael
wallman
we
have
communicated
to
them
the
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
david
michael
wallman
it's
come
up
in
a
number
of
cases,
your
honor.
in
a
number
of
circuits.
and
we
have
no
explanation
as
to
how
it
was
originally
generated.
we
have
discussed
in
the
brief
a
number
of
other
circuits
which
had
utilized
it.
mr.
david
michael
wallman
it
is
factually
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
the
sum
total
of
our
argument.
indiana,
in
accord
with
most
other
jurisdictions,
do
not...
does
not
have
instant
counsel
available
at
the
police
station.
we
have
92
counties
and
many
of
them
small,
rural.
indeed,
all
it
does
is
state
what
is
true
of
the
law
in
indiana.
mr.
david
michael
wallman
indiana
statutory
law
provides
for
the
appointment
of
counsel
at
the
time
the
individual
is
first
taken
to
court.
mr.
david
michael
wallman
at
first
appearance.
mr.
david
michael
wallman
yes,
it
does,
as
long
as
we
don't,
force
him
to
answer
questions.
mr.
david
michael
wallman
that's
our
view,
your
honor.
it
does
no
more
than
simply
state
the
law.
if,
for
example,
giving
a
hypothetical...
if
the
police
officers
had
continued...
had
given
mr.
eagan
this
miranda
and
he
had
indicated
he
wanted
a
counsel
and
we
had
continued
to
question
him,
then
we
would
be
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
that
simply
is
not
the
case
here.
there
are
facts
in
the
record
that
would
indicate
that
was
so.
mr.
david
michael
wallman
i
believe
in
the
pre-sentence
investigation,
which
is
a
part
of
the
record,
he
had
had
some
earlier
charges.
i
do
not
know
whether
they
had
been
reduced
to
a
conviction
or
not.
but
he
had
had
contact
with
the
police
on
a
number
of
other
occasions.
mr.
david
michael
wallman
we
would
be
in
violation
of
the
constitution
if
we
continued
the
interview
at
that
point.
mr.
david
michael
wallman
we
have
no
statutory
law
that
would
demand
that
outcome.
mr.
david
michael
wallman
that's
correct.
mr.
david
michael
wallman
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
michael
wallman
in
our
view
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
cannot
accept
a
voluntary
statement
of
an
individual--
mr.
david
michael
wallman
--who
refuses
to
waive
his--
mr.
david
michael
wallman
--well,
if
one
were
available
readily
available...
and
happened
to
be
on
the
site
and
would
volunteer,--
mr.
david
michael
wallman
--we
have
no
immediate
procedure
for
dealing
with
that.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
david
michael
wallman
the
reason
for
that
is
the
statutory
provision
that
indicates
he
shall
have
a
counsel
appointed
at
the
time
of
his
first
appearance
in
court.
i
do
not
read
any
devious
intent
into
this.
i
don't
think
any
can
be
as
to
having
him--
mr.
david
michael
wallman
--i
would
presume
that's
correct
in
all...
in
virtually
all
miranda
cases
that
reach
any
court
in
this
country.
miranda
only
arises
in
a
situation
where
classically
the
individual
has
waived
his
right
to
counsel
and
made
a
statement.
the
court's
doctrine,
as
we
read
it,
as
the
state
of
indiana
reads
it,
is
that
all
mirandas
are
to
be
viewed
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
clearly,
the
individual...
the
individual
miranda
warning
that
was
utilized
here
warned
mr.
eagan
repeatedly
of
his
right
to
remain
silent.
indeed,
it
made
it
very
clear
to
him
that
he
controlled
virtually
the
entire
course
of
the
interview.
it
is
our
view,
and
the
view,
as
judge
coffey
indicated
in
this
dissent
in
the
seventh
circuit
of
the
view
of
the
fifth,
the
second
and
the
fourth
circuits...
very
similar
language
has
been
approved
by
the
eighth
and
the
tenth
circuits...
this
court's
per
curiam
opinion
in
california
v.
prysock
stands
very
clearly
for
the
proposition
that
no
particular
special
or
magic
language
is
required
for
a
miranda
warning.
indeed,
this
court,
as
we
read
the
court's
cases,
clearly
inspire
jurisdictions
to
attempt
to
make
the
warnings
as
clear
as
possible.
in
our
view,
that's
what
was
done
here.
the
seventh
circuit,
wrongly
in
our
view,
relied
upon
the
dicta
in
prysock
to
hold
that
there
was
a
future
appointment
of
counsel.
in
a
particular
way,
as
we've
already
discussed,
all
counsel
was
a
future
appointment.
if
the
individual
during
the
interview
were
to
say,
"i
want
counsel
now",
obviously
appointment
of
counsel
would
await
finding
counsel.
whether
that
would
take
an
hour,
a
day,
or
a
week,
it
really
makes
no...
it
makes
no
difference.
the
constitutional
protection
is
the
right
to
have
counsel,
if
the
individual
wishes,
prior
to
making
the
statement.
the
second
issue
that
arises
in
regard
to
this
case
is
the
second
miranda.
the
day
following
mr.
eagan's
first
exculpatory
statement,
a
second
miranda
was
read
to
him,
at
which
time
he
confessed.
subsequent
to
that
confession,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
very
day,
he
took
the
police
officers
back
to
the
scene
of
the
crime,
assisted
them
in
finding
the
weapons,
and
identified
the
evidence
then.
that
miranda
itself,
while
there
is
some
discussion
in
the
brief
from
respondent
that
it
is
improper,
clearly
it
has
been
approved
by
both
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
indiana
supreme
court.
the
issue
that
was
remanded
by
the
seventh
circuit
was
whether
or
not
there
was
any
taint
to
the
second
miranda.
this
issue,
as
i
indicated
earlier,
only
arises
if
this
court
finds
against
the
state
of
indiana
on
the
first
issue.
however,
we
clearly
think
that
this
court's
holding
in
oregon
v.
elstad
disavows
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
doctrine
that
arises
in
fourth
amendment
cases
to
this
fifth
amendment
right.
clearly,
the
next
day
there
was
no
indication
in
the
record
that
we
had
intimidated
mr.
eagan,
had
in
any
way
forced
his
testimony,
that
his
statement
was
anything
but
voluntary.
it
is
argued
that
clearly
mr.
eagan
had
the
right...
had
been
properly
warned
of
his
rights
and
had
voluntarily
waived
them
to
make
that
confession.
we
see
no
need
for
the
remand.
we
would
urge
the
court
to...
if
it
reaches
that
second
issue,
to
find
that
remand
is
simply
inappropriate.
i
would
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
michael
wallman
well,
of
course,
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
isn't
bound
by
the
seventh
circuit.
i
mean,
each
one
is
free
to
expound
the
constitution
for
itself.
mr.
david
michael
wallman
thank
you,
your
honor.
just
briefly,
the
state
of
indiana
does
not
ask
for
a
major
revision
of
miranda
in
this
case
when
it's
not
necessary.
in
our
view,
the
warnings
we
provided,
as
we
have
previously
discussed,
clearly
apprised
mr.
eagan
of
nothing
but
the
truth
in
this
case.
indeed,
as
the
court
is
aware,
miranda
itself
has
indicated
that
if
the
state
can't
provide
a
lawyer
on
the
spot,
then
the
only
thing
that
is
prohibited
is
continued
questioning.
to
the
extent
we've
gotten
somewhat
afield
in
regard
to
the
chronology
of
events,
in
our
view,
stated
succinctly,
mr.
eagan
or
any
individual
who
is
mirandized
in
this
way,
has
control
of
the
interrogation
itself.
if
he
feels
that
he
does
not
want
to
continue
a
statement
that
he
has
begun,
or
he
doesn't
want
to
answer
any
questions
in
the
first
instance,
all
he
need
do
to
terminate
that
interview
is
to
simply
say,
"i
want
a
lawyer".
clearly...
clearly,
that
is
not
a
future
event.
mr.
david
michael
wallman
well,
your
honor...
that's
correct,
justice
white.
clearly,
we
wouldn't--
mr.
david
michael
wallman
--well,
we
think
it
is,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
kind
of
question
that
arises
on
a
fairly
regular
basis.
if,
for
example,
a
standard...
a
standard
miranda
were
given
to
an
individual
who
was
cognizant,
had
some
ability
to
think
at
the
time,
one
of
normal
intelligence
as,
"do
you
understand
this"?
"yes".
"do
you
have
any
questions"?
well,
the
likely
first
question
would
be
something
like
this,
and
that
would
be,
"how
do
i
get
a
lawyer?
"
"when
do
i
get
a
lawyer?
"
the
truth
is
our
defense
in
that
case.
we
think
that
these
kinds
of
questions
probably
arise
on
a
fairly
regular
basis
in
regard
to
miranda.
in
other
words,
if
you
indicate
to
the
gentleman
or
the
person
who
is
being
interviewed,
"do
you
have
questions"?
he
has
one,
and
you
give
him
a
truthful
answer,
we
think
that
that
is
constitutionally
permissible.
whether
it's
a
part
of
the
miranda
or
it's
a
part
of
the
interview
that's
recorded,
it
obviously
will
be
examined
at
the
suppression
hearing.
mr.
david
michael
wallman
well,
in
essence
they--
mr.
david
michael
wallman
--well,
the
full
miranda
itself...
and
we're
only
discussing
a
part
of
it...
appears
on
page
133
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
it
does
indeed
make
those
statements.
it
says,
"do
you
understand
this?
"
"do
you
have
any
questions?
"
now,
the
answers
to
those
questions
are
not
necessarily--
mr.
david
michael
wallman
--well,
then
if
the
individual
wishes
to
make
a
statement
or
the
interview
continues,
then
the
questions
and
answers
are
recorded.
mr.
david
michael
wallman
yes.
you--
mr.
david
michael
wallman
--well,
this
miranda--
mr.
david
michael
wallman
--it
indicates
that
he's
read
these
and
he
waives
his
right--
mr.
david
michael
wallman
--to
counsel.
mr.
david
michael
wallman
to
counsel
at
the
time
of
the
interview.
mr.
david
michael
wallman
yes.
mr.
david
michael
wallman
--yes?
mr.
david
michael
wallman
yes.
mr.
david
michael
wallman
that's
correct.
mr.
david
michael
wallman
that's
correct.
mr.
david
michael
wallman
on
page
133
of
the
joint
appendix,
"i
have
read
and
had
read
to
me
the
statement
of
my
rights.
"
"i
understand
what
my
rights
are.
"
"i'm
willing
to
answer
questions
and
make
a
statement.
"
"i
do
not
want
a
lawyer
and
i
know
what
i
am
doing.
"
mr.
david
michael
wallman
at
the
suppression
hearing
and
during
testimony
i
believe
the
testimony
from
the
officers
were
that
he
did...
both
were
done.
mr.
david
michael
wallman
yes.
they
were
read
to
him
and
he
read
them
himself.
mr.
david
michael
wallman
i
believe
the
testimony
in
the
suppression
hearing
and
at
trial
was
to
the
effect
he
read
the
entire
document.
mr.
david
michael
wallman
i
believe
so.
yes.
we
believe,
as
we
have
previously
indicated,
that
the
warning
itself
was
indeed
clear,
it
stated
nothing
more
than
the
truth.
we
would
urge
the
court
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
in
regard
to
the
first
mirandized
statement,
find
miranda
appropriate.
we
believe
that
under
the
court's
previous
rulings
there
is
no
particularized
kind
of
version
of
miranda.
indeed,
many
potential
variants
exist.
this
one
was
entirely
appropriate.
in
the
alternative,
we
would
urge
the
court
to
reverse
the
remand
on
the
second
issue.
we
feel
that
there
is
sufficient
evidence
in
the
record
for
the
court
at
this
juncture,
and
surely
at
the
seventh
circuit
level,
to
make
the
elstad
v.
oregon
determination
itself.
i
have
nothing
further.
