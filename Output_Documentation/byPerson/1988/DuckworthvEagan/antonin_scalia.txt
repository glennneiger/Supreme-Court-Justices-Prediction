justice
scalia
well,
isn't
that
the
explanation
of
why
this
is
such
a
common
formulation?
because
a
lot
of
jurisdictions
are
in
the
same
position.
and
to
tell
the
individual
"you
have
the
right
to
an
attorney.
"
and
he
says,
"okay,
give
me
an
attorney.
"
and
you
say,
"i'm
sorry,
we
don't
have
an
attorney.
"
is
sort
of
like
saying,
you
know,
do
you
want
vanilla,
chocolate
or
strawberry
ice
cream.
you
know,
"i'd
like
strawberry".
"i'm
sorry,
we
don't
have
strawberry.
"
[laughter]
it's
the
old...
it's
a
very
honest
statement,
and
probably
that's
just
why...
the
same
reason
other
jurisdictions
do
it.
justice
scalia
well,
they
couldn't
seek
further
review.
it
hadn't
been
in
a
case
from
indiana,
had
it?
i
think
it
had
been
an
illinois
case.
justice
scalia
it
was
a
seventh
circuit
decision
but
indiana
couldn't
have
sought
further
review.
justice
scalia
if
there
is
an
interrogation--
justice
scalia
--an
offer
of
counsel
at
the
interrogation.
if
there
is
one.
the
way
for
the
person
to
raise
that
is
to
say,
"no,
i
won't
answer".
