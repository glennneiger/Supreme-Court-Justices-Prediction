unknown
speaker
and
the
nevada
court
made
that
at
the
instance
of
the
association?
unknown
speaker
who
said
that
they
were
an
indispensable
part.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
lee,
how
did
the
rule
become
applicable
to
mr.
tarkanian?
sure,
it's
an
ncaa
rule,
but
it
also
becomes
a
school
rule--
unknown
speaker
--because
they
joined.
they're
a
member.
they
say,
"we
agree
to
abide
by
the
ncaa
rules.
"
unknown
speaker
so
this
is
now
the
rule
for
the
institution.
otherwise,
how
did
tarkanian...
how
did
he
get
in
trouble
with
the
university?
he
violated
one
of
their
rules.
unknown
speaker
take
action
against
him.
unknown
speaker
the
university
decided
to
suspend
him.
unknown
speaker
and
they
decided,
well,
this
is
one
or
our
rules,
that
we're
going
to
insist
he
abide
by.
unknown
speaker
you
have
a
state
arbitrator
who
says
that
there
are
three
choices,
but
that
the
only
viable
choice
is
to
allow
the
university's
delegation
to
the
ncaa
of
the
power
to
act
as
ultimate
arbiter
of
these
matters.
and
the
president
of
the
university
adopts
that
determination.
these
are
state
officials
who
announce
that
the
ncaa
must
be
the
ultimate
arbitrator.
do
we
not
give
some
deference
to
that
conclusion
by
the
state
officials
as
a
matter
of
state
law?
unknown
speaker
were
their
conclusions
correct?
was
the
arbitrator
correct
in
what
he
identified
as
alternative
two?
unknown
speaker
if
you
win,
it
means
that...
you
represent
the
ncaa,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
did
he
claim
a
reputational
interest
in
this
case?
his
argument
is
that
he
wants
to
keep
his
job,
and
he
won
that
argument.
his
argument
is
he
wants
to
keep
his
position,
and
he
won
that
argument.
the
university
is
there,
it's
a
responsible
entity.
it's
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
for
all
of
the
relief
that
he
sought.
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that
under
our
cases,
there's
no
necessity
for
finding
the
ncaa
to
be
a
state
actor.
unknown
speaker
you
want
to
try
to
say
no.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
is
there
some
written
indication
of
what
membership
in
the
<ncaa>
[=
ncaa]
means?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
so?
unknown
speaker
well,
he's
had
his
remedy
against
the
university.
he's
no
longer
suspended.
unknown
speaker
he's
still
going
to
be
paid
his
salary,
what
more
does
he
want?
radio
programs.
the
constitutional
right
to
radio
programs.
unknown
speaker
well,
his
due
process
rights
were
violated
were
procedural,
weren't
they?
