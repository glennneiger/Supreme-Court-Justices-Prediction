chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
87-1061,
national
collegiate
athletic
association
v.
jerry
tarkanian.
mr.
lee,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
suspension
from
what,
mr.
lee?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
ncaa
said
in
effect
to
unlv,
"you
must
suspend
so-and-so
for
a
certain
period
of
time?
"
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lee,
did
the
injunction
run
against
he
ncaa,
as
well
as
against
unlv?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
how
did
ncaa
get
in
the
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
business
has
the
ncaa
got
here?
well,
there's
an
injunction
against
the
ncaa
for
taking
any
action
against
the
university.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then,
there
was
relief
granted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
ncaa
is
prohibited
from
taking
any
action
against
unlv.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lee?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
return
for
a
moment
to
this
line
of
questioning...
what
does
mr.
tarkanian
lose
if
you
win
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
the
injunction
against
unlv?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
what
does
mr.
tarkanian
lose,
if
you
win?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
there's
no
reason
that
he
won't
keep
on
having
that,
even
if
you
win
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
university
isn't
a
party
here.
only
mr.
tarkanian
is
a
party.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
it
at
his
request
that
that
court
enjoined
the
ncaa
from
doing
anything
to
unlv,
or
was
it
at
<unlv's>
[=
unlv's]
request?
well,
they
weren't
a
party.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
the
only
outstanding
question
is
fees,
does
that
keep
a
case
alive?
we've
said
costs
don't.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lee.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
lionel.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
say
the
university
delegated
to
the
ncaa,
or
the
ncaa
delegated
to
the
university?
which?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
the
university
delegate
to
the
ncaa
the
authority
to
make
the
final
decision
as
to
whether
someone
should
be
suspended
or
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
never
asserted
that
in
the
nevada
courts.
you
didn't
sue
the
ncaa.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
about
it,
say,
chrysler
motors
has
a
plant
in
wisconsin,
and
isn't
satisfied
with
the
way
it's
working?
so
it
wants
to
move
that
plant
out
of
wisconsin,
but
it
says,
"okay,
we'll
negotiate
with
the
legislature.
"
"if
you'll
revise
certain
laws,
thus
and
so,
and
do
thus
and
so,
we
won't
move
out.
"
now,
does
that
make
chrysler
a
state
actor
in
wisconsin?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
of
course,
your
example,
the
alumnus
had
no
"right"
to
demand
anything.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what's
the
difference
between
the
two
cases?
it
isn't
a
matter
of
right,
because
neither
one
had
any
right.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
maybe
that's
all
he's
entitled
to.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lionel.
mr.
lee,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lee.
the
case
is
submitted.
