justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then,
you
don't...
do
you
find
something
erroneous
in
what
i
said,
that
it
became
a
university
rule
when
the
university
joined
and
said
"we
agree"?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
it
wasn't,
how
did
they
have
the
nerve
to
suspend
mr.
tarkanian?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
certainly
wasn't.
it
was
the
university.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
for
violating
its
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
he
was
correct
that
the
university's
only
real
option
was
to
recognize
ncaa
as
the
ultimate
arbiter?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
want
the
injunction
against
the
ncaa
dissolved?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
that's
dissolved,
it
means
you
can
take
action
against
the
university.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
may
or
may
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
tarkanian,
in
mr.
tarkanian's
suit,
he
got
an
injunction
issued
against
the
ncaa.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
university
wasn't
a
party,
was
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
isn't
this
case
just
moot,
if
mr.
tarkanian
can't
win
anything?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
is
a
question
that
there
was
state
action
in
the
case
in
the
sense
that
the
university
is
a
state
actor,
and
it
did
the
suspending.
but
why
is
the
ncaa
a
state
actor?
that's
the
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
this
is
a
sort
of
a
joint
action
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
if
it
wasn't
bound,
even
if
it
could
just
have
said,
"sorry,
we're
not
going
to
suspend
mr.
tarkanian.
"
even
if
contractually
they
could
have
done
it,
they
didn't.
they
said,
they
did
just
the
reverse.
they
said,
"we
will
abide
by
that
rule.
"
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
do
they
understand?
what
is...
does
a
member
say
"we
will
abide
by
the
ncaa
rules?
"
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
something
in
writing
to
that
effect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
by
becoming
a
member,
you
say
the
member
has
agreed,
in
advance,
in
advance.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
isn't
just
an
ad
hoc
situation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
it
is,
what
is
the
basis
here
for
an
injunction
against
the
ncaa
from
moving
against
the
university?
even
if
it
can
be
called
a
state
actor
by
mr.
tarkanian?
