mr.
lionel,
are
we
bound
by
the
ruling
of
the
nevada
court
that
the
ncaa
is
a
party
and
has
to
be
a
party?
is
there
nothing
we
can
do
about
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
amicus
brief
determines
what
we
shall
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i
don't
mean
not,
no,
i
don't
mean
that.
i
mean
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
a
crucial
point,
and
i
just
want
to
know
am
i
bound
to
recognize
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
that's
what
you
were
saying
all
along--
--mr.
lionel,
in
looking
at
our
cases...
although
they're
not
all
easy
to
reconcile...
there
does
appear
to
be
one
common
theme.
and
that
is,
is
that
the
entity
in
question
must
be
held
to
be
a
state
actor,
or
there
is
no
relief...
mrs.
marsh
and
the
company
town,
the
eagle
coffee
shop,
the
lugar
case.
here,
the
state
remains
a
party,
it
remains
responsible.
it
remained
obligated
to
tarkanian,
not
to
discharge
him.
why
is
it
necessary
for
the
ncaa
to
be
in
the
suit
for
any
meaningful
relief
to
be
given
to
your
client?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
all
the
universities
in
this
country
belong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
many
universities
are
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
good
is
the
figure
of
1,000
if
i
don't
know
what
to
compare
it
with?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know
some
who
don't
belong.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
one
i
graduated
from
didn't.
i
just
can't
help
but
interjecting
the
fact
that
the
university
of
chicago
survived
without
an
athletic
program.
