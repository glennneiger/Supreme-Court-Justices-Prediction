justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you
a
question.
let's
assume
that
we
agree
with
you,
that
the
ncaa
is
a
state
actor
insofar
as
mr.
tarkanian
is
concerned,
that
he
has
a
remedy
against
the
university.
but
what...
even
if
that's
the
case,
what
was
the
basis
for
the
injunction
against
the
ncaa
from
taking
action
against
the
university
itself?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
he
ask
for
an
injunction
against--
justice
byron
r.
white
--against
the
ncaa?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
was
that
the
university?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
that
any
time
the
ncaa
thinks
one
of
its
rules
has
been
violated,
it
can
be
forbidden
to
throw
the
member
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
see
what
the
basis...
even
if
you
win
on
a
state
action
thing,
what's
the
basis
for
telling
the
ncaa
that
it
can't
suspend
the
university,
if
the
university
wants
to
keep
mr.
tarkanian
on,
that's
fine.
but
it's
not
going
to
be
a
member.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
the
ncaa
shouldn't
be
required
to
keep
a
member
on
that
isn't
living
up
to
its
rules.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
think
then
that
even
if
you
win,
as
justice
stevens
suggests,
if
the
ncaa
wanted
to
take
some
action
against
a
state
university,
even
though
no
employee
was
involved,
it
would
have
to
follow
due
process
procedures.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
university's
become
a
member
of
this
association,
and
it
delegated...
it
makes
this
big
delegation,
and
so...
and
the
ncaa
has
some
rules
that
it
must
comport
with
due
process?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
moving
against
the
university?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
you
certainly
are
putting
the
ncaa
in
a
strange
position
in
not
being
able
to
throw
out
a
member
that
refuses
to
abide
by
its
rules.
just
as
a
matter
of
equity
i
would
think
that
the
injunction
is
very
suspect
against
the
ncaa.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
substantive
violation?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
it
looks
like
the
university
is
looking
around
for
a
set
of
rules
to
have
in
its
university,
and
it
suddenly
runs
across
the
ncaa
which
has
promulgated
a
bunch
of
rules
that
it
recommends
for
universities
to
adopt,
and
so
the
university
says,
gee,
here's
a
bunch
of
rules,
we'll
just
adopt
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
just
simply
agreed
to
adopt
this
set
of
rules?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
they're
wrong
on
the
state
action,
that
tarkanian
was
entitled
to
a
remedy
here.
what
was
the
basis
for
the
injunction
against
the
ncaa's
taking
action
against
the
university?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
you
argue
that
even
if
it's
held
to
be
a
state
actor,
that
injunction
shouldn't
stand?
i
don't
know--
justice
byron
r.
white
--i've
never
heard
you
say
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that's
the
argument.
that's
the
question
that
i
asked
you.
even
if
you
lose
on
state
action,
why
should
you
be
forbidden
to
take
action
against
the
university?
