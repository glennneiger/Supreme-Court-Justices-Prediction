mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
national
collegiate
athletic
association's
enforcement
of
its
own
standards,
among
its
own
members,
is
state
action
for
fourteenth
amendment
and
section
1983
purposes.
in
the
early
1970's,
the
ncaa
began
an
investigation
of
certain
alleged
practices
at
the
university
of
nevada
at
las
vegas,
some
of
which
involved
its
basketball
program.
as
is
the
case
with
all
ncaa
investigations,
the
primary
responsibility
for
the
investigation
rests
with
the
university,
and
both
the
university
and
the
association
conducted
their
own
investigations.
the
association's
counsel
ultimately
affirmed
some
38
of
its
infractions
committee's
findings
of
violations,
10
of
which
involved
the
respondent,
who
had
become
the
head
coach
after
the
time
that
the
association
first
received
complaints
about
unlv.
as
part
of
the
prescribed
remedy,
unlv
was
directed
to
show
cause
why
three
persons
should
not
be
suspended
from
coaching
and
any
involvement
with
intercollegiate
athletic
activities.
those
three
persons
were
the
former
head
coach,
the
respondent,
and
an
assistant
coach.
as
for
the
former
coach,
the
suspension
was
to
be
permanent,
and
as
to
the
other
two,
the
suspension
was
to
be
for
two
years.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
from
coaching,
and
from
all
involvement
in
booster
activities
and
other
intercollegiate
activities.
it
would
not
have
affected
his
university
appointment.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
not
quite.
what
it
said
was...
it
was
an
order
to
show
cause
why
they
should
not
do
so.
and
that
is
an
important
point,
actually,
mr.
chief
justice.
pursuant
to
that
order
to
show
cause,
the
president
of
the
university
assigned
a
vice
president
as
hearing
officer,
who
held
a
hearing
and
then
as
a
result
of
that
hearing
identified
for
the
president
three
options
that
were
available
to
the
university,
and
according
to
the
hearing
officer's
recommendation,
those
three
options
were
the
following:
the
first
was
that
the
university
could
impose
the
recommended
discipline,
which
would
involve
the
two-year
suspension.
a
second
was
to
refuse
to
do
so,
and
according
to
the
hearing
officer,
this
ran
the
risk
that
the
ncaa
might
impose
other
sanctions,
some
of
which
might
be
more
severe.
and
the
third
was
to
withdraw
from
ncaa
membership.
faced
with
those
choices,
the
university
opted
to
impose
the
suspension,
which
has
never
been
carried
out,
because
of
an
injunction
which
was
ultimately
affirmed
by
the
nevada
supreme
court,
whose
state
action
holding
is
now
before
this
court
for
review.
the
respondent
does
not
contend...
nor
could
he...
that
the
ncaa
itself
is
a
governmental
entity.
rather,
his
argument--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--it
ran
against
unlv.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
initially,
they
were
not.
the
case
went
up
to
the
nevada
supreme
court
a
first
time,
and
the
nevada
supreme
court
held
that
the
ncaa
was
an
indispensable
party...
so
it
was
back,
the
ncaa
was
joined,
and
then
it
went
up
a
second
time.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
appearing
as
amicus,
that
is--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
but
we
were
not
joined,
initially.
we
contended
that
we
should
be,
and
ultimately
the
nevada
supreme
court
agreed
with
us
on
that
issue,
the
first
time.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
because
the
judgment
that
would
ultimately
come
out
of
the
court
would
necessarily
have
an
important
effect...
after
all,
it
was
our
determination
that
that
was
the
appropriate
remedy
for
the
violation
of
our
rules.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
no,
i
think
not,
because
of
what
this
court
said
in
1982
about
what
are
the
standards
for
determining
state
action,
and
they
are
not
the
same
standards
as
for
determining
whether
a
party
is
indispensable.
and
those
two...
there
are
two
requirements,
that
this
court
announced
in
lugar
v.
edmonson
oil.
the
first
is
that
you
look
to
the
substantive
rule
that
is
being
enforced
in
the
particular
case
and
inquire
into
whether
that
rule
has
its
source
in
some
state
authority.
the
second
is
whether
there
is
sufficient
interlinking,
intermeshing,
between
them.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
of
course,
justice
o'connor,
you
know
much
about...
much
more
about
what
the
court
had
intended.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
in
our
argument,
is
that
they
should.
maybe
not
or
its
face...
it
appears
to
say
all
cases,
and
it
announced
two
requirements,
and
it
said
that
the
difference
between
the
two
requirements
are
demonstrated...
is
demonstrated
by
two
of
the
court's
landmark
cases.
moose
lodge,
which
demonstrates
the
rule
of
decision,
or
the
rule
of
conduct,
requirement,
and
flagg
brothers,
which
demonstrates
the
state
actor
requirement.
and
both
of
those,
of
course,
reach
far
beyond
the
context
in
lugar,
and
far
beyond
the
context
in
this
case,
and
therefore
in
our
view
it
is
a
general
rule.
but
you
don't
have
to
go
that
far...
excuse
me.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
not
quite.
if,
as
i
suggested,
the
first
line
of
defense,
lugar
applies
across
the
board
for
all
cases,
then
it
would
be
the
same.
but
i...
in
any
event,
those
two
tests,
and
particularly
the
first
one,
ought
to
apply
in
a
case
such
as
this,
and
here
is
why.
even
if
it
is
not
the
principled,
of
the
two-part,
across
the
board
test
in
all
cases
that
we
take,
at
the
very
least,
when
the
sole
issue
in
the
case
is
whether
a
particular
rule
of
conduct
has
been
violated,
as
it
has
in
this
case...
the
ncaa's
standards
for
eligibility
and
recruitment...
then,
at
the
very
least
when
that's
the
sole,
ultimate
issue
in
the
case,
then
one
of
the
relative
inquiries,
on
a
case-by-case
approach...
one
of
the
most
important
inquiries...
ought
to
be
whether
the
rule
of
conduct
in
that
particular
case
had
a
governmental
source
or
a
non-governmental
source.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that's
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
the
ncaa
is
composed
in
part
of
public
universities
and
in
part
of
state
universities.
but
it
cannot
be
the
rule,
i
submit,
simply
because
you
have
some
state
universities
and
some
private
universities,
that
it
thereby
becomes,
that
it
thereby
becomes--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--it
really
was
not
a
university
rule.
it
remained--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--they
have
the
nerve
to
suspend
mr.
tarkanian
because
they
decided
on
the
basis
of
their
exercise
of
their
own
judgment
that
of
the
three
options
available
to
them,
that
was
the
one
that
was
preferable
to
them.
it
was
not
the
ncaa
that
suspended
tarkanian.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
for
violating...
the
university
suspended
tarkanian
not
for
violating
its
rule,
but
rather
because
it
determined
that,
of
the
three
options
that
were
available
to
it,
as
a
result
of
the
order
to
show
cause,
the
one
that
was
most
in
the
university's
interest
was
the
option
to
impose
the
recommended,
the
recommended
suspension.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
relief
was
against
the
university
and
not
against
the
ncaa.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
excuse
me,
in
that
sense
there
was.
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
ninety
percent
of
them,
90
percent
of
the--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--the
rules
that
he
violated
were
the
ncaa's
rules
of
eligibility
and
recruitment.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
they
became
applicable
to
him
only
because
the
ncaa
prescribed
"we
have
determined
that
these
violations
have
occurred.
"
and
the
university
was
ordered
to
show
cause
why
as
a
result
of
those
violations
he
should
not
be
suspended.
but
it
was
the
university--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes,
he
had
an
obligation
to
his
university,
in
the
sense
that
the
university
was
jointly
responsible
with
the
ncaa
for
seeing
to
it
that
they
did
agree
that
they
would
enforce
those
rules.
but
my
point
is
this:
that
if
you
take
seriously
what
this
court
said
in
lugar,
about
looking
to
the
source
of
the
substantive
rules,
this
is
the
classic
case
in
which,
in
which
that
requirement
applies.
if
you
look
to
all
of
the
factors
that
might
enter
into
whether
there
is
or
is
not
state
action,
the
only
issue
in
this
case,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
the
only
substantive
issue,
is
whether
the
rules,
some
rules
have
been
violated.
those
rules
are
the
eligibility
rules
that
have
been
set
by
the
university,
that
have
been
set
by
the
ncaa,
and
which
have
become
the
university's
rules
only
in
the
sense
that
the
university
is
one
of
those
members.
but
the
university
did
not
have
to
dismiss
him.
there
were
other
options
that
were
available
to
them...
and
particularly,
particularly
in
a
case
where
the
only
issue,
the
only
substantive
issue,
is
the
issue
whether
or
not
particular
rules
have
been
violated,
then
the
source
of
those
rules
ought
to
be
relevant
to
the
state
action
issue.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
excuse
me?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct,
but
that
was--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--this
case
in
that
respect,
justice
white,
really
follows
a
fortiori
from
this
court's
holding
in
blum
v.
yaretsky.
in
that
instance,
what
you
had
was
a
decision
to
transfer
patients
from
a
lesser-care
facility...
excuse
me,
from
a
higher-care
facility
to
a
lesser-care
facility.
and
the
decision
was
made...
the
rule
of
conduct,
or
the
rule
of
decision
in
that
particular
instance,
if
you
will,
was
made
by
private
individuals.
but
once
those
private
individuals,
the
doctors,
made
that
decision,
it
had
an
effect
on
important
governmental
interests.
the
governmental
decision
as
to
how
to
treat
these
individuals,
the
medicaid
program
is
a
governmental
program,
but
the
relevant
decisions
were
in
effect
made
by
the
private
entities...
including
the
amount
of
money
that
would
be
spent
by
government.
nevertheless,
what
this
court
said
was
that
all
the
government
had
done
was
to
respond
to
those
private
decisions,
and
that
is
exactly
what
we
have
in
this
instance.
you
have
the
ncaa
having
set
its
rules,
and
its
members
then
responding
to
the
termination
of
those
rules
violations,
and
that
we
submit,
under
blum
v.
yaretsky
and
under
lugar,
is
not
state
action.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
of
course
you
give
deference
to
them,
justice
kennedy.
but
the
issue
here
is
whether
the
state
action
rules,
which
are
of
course
constitutional
determinations,
and
interpretations
of
section
1983
by
this
court...
and
what
the
state
did
in
that
instance
was
simply
to
determine,
yes,
we
became
members
of
the
ncaa.
when
we
become
members
of
the
ncaa,
we
determine
that
we
will
abide
by
their
rules.
but
they
also
identified
that
they
had
other
options.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
i
think
he
was...
yes,
he
was.
alternative
two
was
that
they
could
have
said
no,
and
they
could
have...
then
other
sanctions
would
have
had
to
be--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
i
don't
know
that
he
identified
that
as
the
only
real
option.
it
was
his
recommended
option.
but
the...
i
think
this
point
should
be
made
very
clear:
unlv
did
not
have
to
fire
tarkanian.
that
was
their
decision,
their
option,
and
they
made
it
from
a
choice
of
those
three.
moreover,
this
first
requirement
that
the
court
established
in
lugar,
in
any
event,
is
absent
in
this
case,
and
regardless
of
how
far
it
extends,
it
should
be
applicable
in
a
case,
in
a
case
such
as
this.
i
think
that
key
to
decision
is
to
draw
a
careful
decision...
excuse
me,
draw
a
careful
distinction
between
what
the
ncaa
did
on
the
one
hand,
and
what
unlv
did
on
the
other
hand.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
that
is...
we
believe
that
if
we
win,
this
court,
pursuant
to
the
exercise
of
its
equity
powers,
does
have
the
authority
simply
to
dissolve
the
injunction.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
we
believe
that
is
basically
what
happened
in
moose
lodge,
and
that
this
court
would
have
the
authority
to
do
that.
but
that
is
not
a
central
part
of
our
case,
and
the
court...
in
the
event
that
the
court
disagrees,
then
that
is
basically
unlv's
problem.
because
this
will
be
the
status
of
the
case
in
the
event
that--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--at
the
present
time,
he
has
an
injunction
against
unlv
that--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--and
in
that
event...
in
the
event
that
that
happens,
then
here
will
be
the
status
of
the
case.
there
is
still
outstanding
an
order
to
show
cause
applicable
to
the
university
of
nevada.
and
at
that
point,
there
will
still
be
three
options
available
to
the
university
of
nevada,
except
that
the
third
one
will
have
changed.
and
the
third
one
will
be
to
go
back
to
the
nevada
state
supreme
court,
to
go
back
to
the
nevada
court,
and
attempt
to
persuade
them
that
the
injunction
should
be
dissolved
because
it
was
based
on
a
premise
which
the
united
states
supreme
court
has
now
declared
to
be
faulty.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
right.
the
university
is
not
a
party
to
the
action
before
this
court.
and
as
a
consequence,
it
will
be
just
as
justice
white
said.
we
can
then
take
action
against
the
university.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
and
that,
of
course,
can
be
dissolved.
and
in
the
event
that
that
happens,
then
the
university--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--excuse
me?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
the
university
was
a
party,
but
they
did
not
appeal
to
the
nevada
supreme
court,
they
did
not
appeal
to
the
nevada
supreme
court.
but
there
will
still
be
an
outstanding
order
to
show
cause
pending...
the
ncaa's
order
to
show
cause,
pending
against
the
university
of
nevada.
and
they
will
then
still
have
the
same
three
options,
except
that
the
one
option
will
now
be
modified
because
they
will
either
have
to
go
back
and
attempt
to
persuade
the
nevada
courts
that
the
injunction
was--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
it
isn't
moot
for
two
reasons.
because
in
the
first
place,
we
do
have
the
matter
of
the
attorney's
fees.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
i
would
hope
that
$200,000
does.
and
i
would
think
that
the
fee
certainly
does.
but
in
addition,
more
importantly--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes,
and
that's--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--and
that,
of
course,
is
more
important,
is
even
more
important
than
the
fees
itself,
because
you
do
have,
you
do
have
an
outstanding
determination
by
a
state
supreme
court
that
this
area
of
individual
freedom,
which
is
guaranteed
by
the
limitation
of
the
state
action
doctrine,
as
the
court
said
in
lugar,
has
been
withdrawn
from
the
ncaa,
and
its
ability
to
conduct
its
investigations
in
the
way
that
it
sees
as
in
its
best
interests
has
been
severely
curtailed.
let
me
just
say
that
there
are,
in
addition
to
the
legal
reasons
that
neither
one
of
the
lugar
tests,
neither
the
rule
of
conduct
issue
nor
the
joint
participation
issue
has
been
satisfied
in
this
case.
there
are
good
reasons
why
the
state
action
rules
should
not
apply
to
the
ncaa's
enforcement
of
its
own
rules
among
its
own
members.
this
court
said
four
years
ago
that
the
ncaa
plays
a
critical
role
in
the
maintenance
of
a
revered
tradition
of
amateurism
in
college
sports,
and
there
can
be
no
question
but
that
it
needs
ample
latitude
to
play
that
role.
this
is
the
classic
case
that
illustrates
both
that
critical
role
and
why
it
needs
ample
latitude
in
order
to
carry
it
out.
the
procedures
that
it
follows
place
principal
responsibility,
or
divide
the
responsibility
for
enforcement,
as
between
the
two.
it
is
not
a
strictly
adversarial
kind
of
procedure.
what
the
ncaa
has
concluded
over
the
years
is
that
it
can
best
be
done
by
a
combination
of
cooperation
and
adversarialness.
and
the
accomplishment...
that
ample
latitude
that
this
court
observed
that
the
association
needs
to
carry
out
its
critical
role...
will
be
aided
by
leaving
this
area
of
associational
freedom
continually
available
to
the
ncaa
so
that
it
can
make
its
own
judgments
as
to
how
best
to
carry
it
out.
the
key
to
decision,
i
submit,
to
this
case,
is
to
distinguish
rather
carefully
between
what
the
ncaa
does
on
the
one
hand
and
what
the
university
did
on
the
other.
what
the
ncaa
did
was
to
set
its
own
standards
for
conduct.
because
they
were
the
ncaa's
standards
and
not
the
university's
standards,
the
first
of
the
lugar
requirements
has
not
been
satisfied.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
i
think
not,
and
i
think
that
to
say
that,
to
characterize
it
in
that
way,
justice
o'connor,
really
does
violate
the
spirit
of
what
i
think
to
be
not
only
lugar,
but
also
this
court's
more
recent
pronouncement
in
the
area,
which
is
west
v.
atkins,
in
which
those
two
requirements
were
repeated.
as
the
lugar
opinion
says,
they
really
aren't
the
same.
they
are
two
separate
requirements.
and
especially
in
a
case
where
the
only
substantive
issue
at
the
end
of
the
day
is
whether
rules
have
been
violated,
you
ought
to
ask,
"where
do
those
rules
come
from?
"
those
are
not
unlv's
rules,
they
are
the
ncaa's
rules.
they
are
unlv's
rules
only
in
the
sense
that
unlv
is
a
member
of
the
association.
but
the
association
itself
is
a
private
entity,
and
they
are,
the
association
is,
the
source
of
the
rules.
what
the
university
did
was,
what
the
ncaa
did
not
do,
was
to
make
the
decision,
was
to
suspend
tarkanian.
all
the
the
ncaa
did
in
this
respect
was
to
determine
that
its
standards
of
conduct
had
been
violated,
that
its
conditions
of
membership
had
been
violated,
and
then
it
was
the
university
that
exercised
its
choice
among
three
options
available
to
it.
for
two
independent
reasons,
therefore,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
nevada
court
should
be
reversed.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
answer
to
justice
white's
question,
the
obligation
that
the
unlv
is
under
tort
appears
on
page
80
of
the
joint
appendix.
and
what
it
is,
of
course,
is
an
agreement
to,
it's
on
fundamental
policy
2(b),
"shall
be
obligated
to
apply
and
enforce
this
legislation
and
the
enforcement
program
of
the
association
shall
be
applied
to
an
institution
when
it
fails
to
fulfill
this
obligation.
"
what
the
unlv
agreed
to
do
was
to
abide
by
the
ncaa's
rules.
what
it
did
not
agree
to
do,
and
could
not
have
agreed
to
do,
as
a
governmental
entity,
was
to
delegate
any
kind
of
discipline
of
state
employees
or
any
other
governmental
function
to
the
ncaa.
and
the
way
it's
tested
is
this:
assume
that
what
president
bepler
had
said,
back
in
1977,
was
"no,
our
answer
to
the
order
to
show
cause
is
we
cannot
and
will
not,
because
under
our
judgment,
he
just
doesn't
deserve
to
be
suspended,
and
that
is
a
function
that
is
non-delegable
as
a
matter
of
nevada
state
law.
"
what
the
ncaa
would
have
done
at
that
point
is
to
look
to
other
sanctions.
they
would
not
have,
and
could
not
have
required
that
he
be
dismissed.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
as
a
condition
of
membership,
they
have
agreed,
as
a
condition
of
membership--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct.
as
a
condition
of
membership...
and
in
the
event
that
they
decide
not
to
follow
those
rules,
or
not
to
follow
the
ncaa
procedures,
they
can
either
accept...
it
wasn't
just
a
matter
of
ncaa
membership,
though
if
it
were,
the
legal
rule
would
still
have
been
the
same.
they
could
have
accepted
other,
less
severe
sanctions,
such
as
an
extended
period
of
probation,
pure
scholarships,
etcetera.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
because
the
state
court
judge
said
that
unlv
had
acted
wrongfully,
and
there
was
a
derivative,
there
was
a
derivative
right
from
the
ncaa.
i
do
not
defend
that...
i
do
not
think
that's
right...
but
that
was
the
basis
for
the
injunction.
and
i
want
to
stress
that
the
only
relief
we're
asking
for
is
the
relief
of,
of
the
release
of
the
injunction
against
the
ncaa.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
no,
no.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
no,
no.
i'm
not
saying
that
even
if
we're
held--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--i
see.
i
think
there
are
good
reasons
why
we
shouldn't,
but
we
also
think
we
are
not
a
state
actor,
for
reasons
that
have
been
stated.
what
this
whole
argument
this
morning
has
demonstrated
is
the
mischief
that
you
get
into
once
you
open
the
door
beyond
those
two
lugar
requirements.
there
are
good
reasons
for
those
two
lugar
requirements,
and
also
for
the
rule
in
blum
v.
yaretsky.
all
that
happened
here
was
a
response
by
a
governmental
entity
to
a
non-governmental
entity.
blum
v.
yaretsky
says
that
that
is
not
sufficient.
and
once
you
open
that
door,
you
get
into
problems
like
the
united
airlines
hypothetical,
and
like
the
numerous
others
that
are
raised
in
our
brief.
there
are
lots
of
accrediting
agencies,
for
example,
that
set
standards,
private
entities,
that
set
standards
for
governmental
entities
to
abide
by.
are
they
bound
by
the
full
panoply
of
fourteenth
amendment
and
1983
restrictions
on
their
area
of
private
activity,
and
also
subject
to
damage
actions?
we
would
hope
not.
