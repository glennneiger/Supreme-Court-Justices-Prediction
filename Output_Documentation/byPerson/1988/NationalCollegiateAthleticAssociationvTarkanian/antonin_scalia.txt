and
you
also
have
to
pay
its
fees,
don't
you?
justice
antonin

mr.
lee,
i'm
a
little
confused
about
what
was
the
basis
for
the
firing
here.
it
seems
to
me
if
the
man
has
an
employment
contract
with
the
university,
the
university
can't
say
we're
firing
you
for
breaking
somebody
else's
rules.
he
must
have
violated
some
rule
that
was
imposed
by
virtue
of
his
employment
with
the
university?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
how
did
they
become
applicable
to
him?
i
assume
they
became
applicable
to
him
through
his
employment
contract
with
the
university.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he
must
have
had
an
obligation
to
someone
not
to
commit
those
violations.
to
whom
did
he
have
that
obligation?
justice
antonin
scalia
when
you
say
contractually
bound,
what...
is
there
a
term
of
years
to
a
membership
in
the
ncaa?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
is
there
some
liability,
some
financial
liability,
if
you
pull
out?
justice
antonin
scalia
then
how
can
you
say
you
are
contractually
bound?
the
fact
is,
they
could
have
repudiated
the
contract
at
any
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
said,
"we
do
our
own
hiring
and
firing.
"
"we
don't
like
this
particular
decision
and,
therefore,
we
will
no
longer
be
part
of
the
ncaa.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
this
was
an
adhesion
contract?
the
state
of
nevada
has
been
subjected
to
an
adhesion
contract,
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
lionel,
let
me
ask
you...
assuming
i
accept
your
theory
of
adhesion
contract,
which
is
i
think
what
we've
been
talking
about...
is
it
clear
that
this
is
an
adhesion
contract,
i
mean
that
there
was
no
other
option?
aren't
there
a
lot
of
universities
that
don't
belong
to
the
ncaa?
the
world
comes
to
an
end
if
you
can't
belong
to
the
ncaa?
i
thought
probably
more
don't
belong
than
do
belong,
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
no
university
with
any
kind
of
an
athletic
program?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
that
much
the
end
of
the
world,
that
there
was
no
realistic
option
except
to
belong
to
the
ncaa?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
a
lot
of
educators
would
be
surprised
to
hear
that.
well,
they
can
shut
down
the
football
program,
basketball.
well,
it's
not
in
the
record...
is
anything
in
the
record
about
how
many
universities
belong
or
do
not
belong?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
constitution
forbids
the
university
from
firing
coach
tarkanian
without
proper
process,
but
surely
the
constitution
doesn't
require
that
the
university
give
him
a
major-league
basketball
team
to
coach,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
then
what
is
the...
maybe
the
chief
justice
is
right,
that
all
he
is
entitled
to
under
the
constitution
is
a
pyrrhic
victory,
that
he
can
coach
whatever
basketball
team
the
university
has?
justice
antonin
scalia
property
right,
not
just
to
have
a
job
with
the
university,
not
just
to
coach
the
university's
basketball
team,
but
a
property
right
to
coach
an
ncaa
basketball
team...
that's
what
the
constitution
guarantees
him?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
your
position,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
if
the
ncaa
is
a
state
actor,
it
has
to
follow
constitutional
procedures
when
it
imposes
sanctions
on
anybody.
and
you
would
really
require
them
to
remodel
their
whole
procedural
mechanisms
for
dealing
with
this
kind
of
case
and
maybe...
you
know,
if
you're
right,
it
seems
to
me
that
they
would
have
an
obligation
to
follow
due
process
procedures,
and
not
use
private
investigators,
to
rely
on
hearsay
and
that
sort
of
thing.
so
what
really
is
at
stake
is
what
kind
of
procedures
they
can
use
when
the
member
that's
being
challenged
is
a
public
entity
rather
than
a
private
one.
