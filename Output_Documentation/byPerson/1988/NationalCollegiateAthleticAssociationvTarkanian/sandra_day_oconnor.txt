but
why
did
you
contend
that
ncaa
was
indispensable,
mr.
lee?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
a
little
strange
to
be
arguing
in
a
way
that
ncaa
was
a
necessary
party
to
the
action,
and
yet
should
not
be
considered
in
any
way
as
state
actor.
is
there
any
tension
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
lugar
was
intended
to
be
the
definitive
statement
of
how
we
determine
state
action
in
all
cases,
even
those
of
perhaps
delegation
or
joint
participation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you're
arguing
that
that
is
now
the
definitive
rule.
i'm
not
sure
that
i
can
read
lugar
that
way,
and
i'm
not
sure
whether
those
tests
should
be
applied
in
all
situations
of
delegation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
ncaa
said,
for
example,
we
want
drug
testing
of
all
participating
athletes
on
a
regular
basis,
and
you
either
do
that,
or
you
run
the
risk
of
the
school
being
dropped
out
of
the
ncaa.
now,
is
there
any...
do
we
have
exactly
the
same
kind
of
an
issue
that
we
have
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
didn't
the
university
make
those
standards
its
own
by
contract?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
record
looks
like
the
university
basically
agreed
with
mr.
tarkanian
here,
and
did
not
want
to
fire
him,
and
didn't
agree
with
the
ncaa's
assessment
of
the
facts,
and
chose
not
to
appeal
the
state
court
decision
that
said
the
university
couldn't
fire...
couldn't
suspend
him.
and
it
looked
very
much
like
the
university
is
not
acting
jointly,
in
a
sense,
in
that
sense,
with
the
ncaa.
it
basically
took
mr.
tarkanian's
view
of
the
thing.
