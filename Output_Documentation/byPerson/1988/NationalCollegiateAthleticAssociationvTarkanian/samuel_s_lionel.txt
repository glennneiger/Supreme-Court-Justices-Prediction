mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i'm
looking
at
page
three
of
our
brief
here,
and
i'm
reading
from
the
ncaa
enforcement
program.
among
other
things,
it
says,
"the
enforcement
procedures
are
an
essential
part
of
the
intercollegiate
athletic
program
of
each
member
institution.
"
thus,
when
the
university
became
a
member
of
the
association,
its
enforcement
procedures
became
a
part
of
its
athletic
program.
not
only
that,
by
becoming
a
member,
the
university
agreed
to
abide
by
the
constitution,
the
bylaws,
the
rules,
the
interpretations
of
those
rules,
and
the
policies
of
the
ncaa.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
the
ncaa
is
a
state
actor
because
the
university
delegated
to
the
association
the
right
to
make
the
disciplinary
standards
and
determinations
and
have
a
rule
of
conduct,
as
it
did
here...
and
that
comes
clearly
under
the
lugar,
the
delegation...
there's
delegation
under
the
first
prong,
mr.
justice.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
absolute,
in
our
view,
yes.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
no,
the
university
delegated
to
the
ncaa
the
right
to
set
the
standards,
disciplinary
standards,
with
respect
to
state
employees
involved
in
the
athletic
program,
and
to
make
determinations
as
to
whether
there
were
violations
of
those
standards,
and
to
impose
penalties
against
state
employees
for
their
claimed
violations
of
these
standards.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
yes,
it
did,
and
that
is
exactly
what
happened
here,
because
the
ncaa
said
that
coach
tarkanian
would
be,
should
be
suspended
for
two
years,
and
the
hearing
officer,
who
held
a
hearing
under
the
procedures
contained,
under
the
ncaa
enforcement
procedures
adopted,
said
that
this
is
what
you
are,
we
are
contractually
compelled,
to
carry
out
that
sanction
and
recommended
to
the
president
of
the
university
that
it
be
done.
and
the
president
of
the
university
within
two
days
wrote
to
mr.
tarkanian
and
said,
"we
have...
i
have
no
alternative,
we
must...
are
contractually
bound
to
follow
the
penalties
of
the
ncaa,
adjudged
by
the
ncaa,
and
you
are
therefore
suspended
for
two
years.
"
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
i'm
not
aware
that
there
is.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
there
is
no
direct
financial
liability.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
but--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
--but
as
the
record
indicates,
the
ncaa
is
the
only
game
in
town.
if
a
university
wants
to
engage
in
major
athletics,
it
must
be
a
member
of
the
ncaa.
if
it
is
not,
it
cannot
engage
in
major
athletics.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
well,
that's
actually
what
happened
in
this
instance
here,
but
that
is
the
only
game
in
town.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
happened
here,
is
initially
coach
tarkanian
sued
only
the
university,
and
obtained
an
injunction.
the
university
was
requested
by
the
ncaa
to
appeal
that,
which
it
did,
and
then
the
ncaa
filed
an
amicus
brief
taking
the
position
that
it
was
an
indispensable
party
because
the
injunction
against
the
university
impaired
the
right
of
the
ncaa
to
enforce
the
penalties
which
it
had
judged
under
its
program.
in
that
amicus
brief,
it
said
the
following:
that
the
university
was
bound
by
contract
to
abide
by
the
ncaa
penalties.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
yes,
they
did.
and
in
any,
almost
every
state
action,
there
is
an
option
on
the
part
of
the
state
actor
and
on
the
part
of
the
state.
when
the
state
fires
somebody,
and
there
may
be
a
constitutional
violation
involved...
the
1983
case...
they
could
not
have
fired
that
person.
there
is
always
an
option.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
i
submit
that
that,
justice
o'connor,
is
not
really
what
happened
here.
under
the
rules,
the
university
was
supposed
to
cooperate
when
charges
were
filed...
and
they
did.
they
investigated
it
as
they
were
required
and
filed
everything
that
was
filed,
participated
in
the
hearing.
there
was
nothing
in
the
rules
that
say
that
the
university
must
lay
down
and
agree
with
everything
the
ncaa
did.
they
filed
charges,
and
they
admitted
some
of
those
charges,
and
in
some
cases
they
did
not
admit
those
charges.
and
the
committee
on
infractions
made
a
determination,
and
then
they
said
that
coach
tarkanian,
the
university
should
suspend
tarkanian
for
two
years.
and
when
it
came
back,
the
hearing
officer
said
that
the
basis
for
those
findings
and
the
sanctions
appeared
to
be
clearly
in
doubt,
and
the
due
process
that
was
followed
was
somewhat
suspect,
but
we
are
contractually
compelled,
and
therefore
you
should
do
it,
mr.
president.
mr.
president
said,
"we
have
no
alternative.
"
"we
will
do
it.
"
"we
will
say
that
there
was
joint
participation
at
all
times.
"
it
is
true
that
the
university
did
not
agree
with
what
happened.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
justice
marshall,
it
would
appear
that
is
a...
may
very
well
be
law
of
this
case,
particularly
when
it
came
into
being
at
the
instigation
of
the
association.
this
case
was
over,
we
thought,
many
years
ago,
until
they
filed
that
petition
to...
the
amicus
brief.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
i
may
have
to
withdraw.
i
would
assume
this
court
can
do
what
it
wishes
in
this
case
here.
[laughter]
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
it
would
seem
to
me
that
one
could
very
well
say
that
the
association
should
not
be
committed
at
this
time
to
say
that
we
claim
that
we
were
indispensable,
this
case
has
gone
on
for
years
only
because
the
court
agreed
that
we
had
rights
to
protect
at
that
time.
now
we're
saying
we
should
not
be
a
party.
i
think,
arguably,
it
could
be
estopped
from
taking
that
position.
we
have
been
troubled
by
that.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
if
the
ncaa
is
not
enjoined
from
proceeding
against
the
university,
and
to
take
steps
which
might
ultimately
throw
the
university
out
of
the
ncaa,
the
victory
of
mr.
tarkanian
is
a
hollow
one,
because
there
will
be
no
basketball
program
anymore.
he
will
have
nothing
to
coach.
he
will
not
be
able
to
get
a
job
coaching
college
athletics
because
of
what
has
happened
in
this
particular
case.
the
rules
say
that
before
any
university
hires
someone
as
a
coach,
they
should
check
to
see
what
his
history
may
have
been
with
respect
to
any
claimed
violations
against
the
ncaa.
and
i
submit
under
those--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
--i
would
say,
i
would
say
he,
his...
as
i
pointed
out,
he
would
have
no
victory,
and
not
only
that,
whether
or
not...
certainly
he
has
in
our
view
a
1983
cause
of
action,
because
the
ncaa
is
a
joint
participant--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
--well,
what
happened
was,
we
amended
the
complaint
after
the
reversal
and
remand,
so
the
ncaa
could
then
become
a
party.
we
amended
it,
and
stated
a
1983
claim
against
the
ncaa.
so
this
present
complaint
is
against
both
the
university
and
the
ncaa,
stating
claims
under
1983,
and
the
courts
below
found...
the
trial
court
found
that
there
was
a
1983
case
against
both.
only
the
ncaa
did
appeal
to
the
state
court,
and
is
here.
but
there
clearly
is
a
claim,
and
our
position
is
that
there
is
such
a
claim...
that
the
ncaa
is
a
joint
participant,
that
the
ncaa
under
west
v.
atkins
was
delegated
these
disciplinary
rights
over
a
state
employee...
and
we
say
we
are
a
stronger
case
than
west
v.
atkins.
in
west
v.
atkins,
you
find
a
delegation,
and
you
find
a
deferral
by
the
state.
in
this
case,
there
is
a
delegation.
there
is
a
deferral
by
the
state,
and
then
the
state
afforded
the
ncaa
significant
assistance
in
saying
to
tarkanian,
"you
are
now
suspended".
so,
this
is
a
stronger
case
than
that.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
i'm
sure
that's
true.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
but
the
delegation
is
broader
than
rulemaking
power
and
standards,
creating
standards.
but
the
ncaa,
under
the
delegation,
was
permitted
to
have
investigations,
hearings,
and
make
determinations.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
the
university
did,
and
that's
exactly
what
the
ncaa
said
in
its
amicus
brief,
when
it
sought
intervention.
and
it
said
further--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
--yes.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
that's
correct,
but
in
fact
they
were
their
rules,
and
which
became
part--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
--that's
correct.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
yes.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
rules
which
are
set
forth
in
our
appendix
indicate--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
--not
a
realistic
option
in
any
way.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
just
as
the
judge
in
dennis
v.
sparks
had
a
legal
option
not
to
accept
the
alleged--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
--the
mere...
if
you--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
--it's
a
gray
area.
one
can
always
see
a
situation
where
someone
can
have
enough
economic
power
to
do
something.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
if
there
is
sufficient
economic
power
to
affect
them,
then
i
would
say--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
--there's
a
big
gray
area
in
there,
and
i'd
like
to--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
--i
can
see
a
situation
where
an
alumnus
of
the
university
would
come
to
the
president
and
say,
"i'm
the
biggest...
i
give
you,
donate
more
money
than
anybody
else,
and
i
will
give
you
an
additional
$10
or
$<fifteen>
[=
15]
million
if
you
fire
somebody
there.
"
and
i
would
say
that
gets
pretty
close
to
saying
that
person
could
be
a
state
actor,
if
that
person
is
fired
without
due
process
of
law.
i
would
say
that
person
might
be
a
joint
participant.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
no.
i
would
say
no.
that
is
pressure,
that
one
might
get
from
a
newspaper
or
something
of
that
nature.
that
person
has
no
right
to
demand
that
the
state
give
them
overt,
official
significant
help.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
well,
it
gets
very
close,
in
that
it
puts
them
under
the
gun.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
as
i...
i
find
a
great
gray
area,
and
at
some
point
if
it
puts
someone
arguably
out
of
business,
a
university,
it's
very
important
that
the
university
must
have
this,
otherwise
it
would
not
be
able
to
operate,...
this
is
in
this
case
that
the
university
needs
to
be
a
member
of
the
ncaa
basketball
program,
which
is
an
important
matter--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
--from
the
standpoint
of
what,
justice?
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
yes,
well,--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
--we
have
not
been
able
to
find
anything
in
writing,
except
the
rules
of
the
ncaa,
the
constitution
and
the
bylaws
say
that
a
member
agrees
to
abide
by
our
constitution,
the
bylaws,
our
rules,
and
our
enforcement
program.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
yes.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
absolutely.
he
has
agreed,
and
that
was
the
exact
position
that
the
ncaa
took
in
its
amicus
brief.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
no,
no
university
with
any
kind
of
athletic
program
is
not
a
member,
is
not
a
member.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
any
kind
of
a...
let's
call
it
a
major
athletic
program.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
no
realistic
option.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
yes,
i
believe
there
are
approximately
1,000
universities,
at
least
half
of
which
are
state
universities.
all
the
service
academies
are
members.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
yes,
all
the
service
academies.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
no,
no.
but
approximately
1,000
universities.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
i
don't
know
that.
justice
marshall.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
well,
it
encompasses
all
universities
which
have
major
athletic
programs.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
there
are.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
and
that
survived
well.
with
respect
to
the
lugar
case,
we
think
we
fall
clearly
under
lugar.
the
first
prong
of
lugar
indicates
two
different
types
of
situations,
one
where
there
is
a
delegation...
and
here
there
is
that
delegation
to
the
ncaa,
of
the
right
to
make
those
disciplinary
standards
and
determination...
and
number
two,
that
if
there
is,
if
the
state
imposes
a
rule
of
conduct...
now,
the
rule
of
conduct
here
is
the
ncaa
saying
that
jerry
tarkanian
did
this,
which
he
shouldn't,
and
there
should
be
a
two-year
suspension.
and
the
university
imposed
that.
that
clearly
comes
under
lugar,
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
insofar
as
the
association
is
concerned,
its
conduct
is
attributable
to
the
state.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
because
if
it
were
permitted
to
take
action
against
the
university,
the
injunction
that
coach
tarkarian
received
will
not
help
him
any.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
because
if
the
university
no
longer
belongs
to
the
ncaa--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
--it
won't
have
a
major
college
athletic
program.
he
will
have
nothing
there
that
he
can
coach.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
yes,
he
did.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
yes,
we
never
sought--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
--against
both.
when
we
amended
the
complaint,
after
the
remand,
to
make
it
so
the
ncaa
could
become
a
party,
we
amended
it
and
also
stated
a
claim
under
1983
against
the
association.
and
we
sought
an
injunction...
we
never
sought
damages.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
no.
it's
only
if
we
can...
the
ncaa--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
--but
the
injunction...
coach
tarkanian
would
then
have
obtained
just
a
pyrrhic
victory.
he
has--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
--but
his
constitutional
rights
have
been
infringed
upon.
he's
been
denied
due
process
in
connection
with
this,
and
he--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
--the
only
rule
that
would
be
involved
here
would
be
the
non-suspension
of
coach
tarkanian.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
no,
it
doesn't.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
well,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
a
court
of
equity
could
do
what
the
court
below
did
here.
the
court
said,
"he
has
a
right
to
have
vindicated
his
constitutional
rights.
"
he
is
not
vindicated
but
if
we
are
going
to
say
he
can't
continue
to
do
what
he
did
before,
in
which
the
court
found
he
had
a
property
right.
in
effect,
if
there
is
no
injunction
against
the
ncaa,
he
will
have
lost
that
property
right
to
be
that
basketball
coach--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
--yes,
and
also,
there
were
other
rights
that
flowed
from
that,
as
we
pointed
out.
he
lost...
he
had
clinics,
he
had
other
matters,
and
radio
programs,
all
of
which
came
from
the
fact
that
he
was
the
basketball
coach
at
the
university.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
that's
correct.
and
in
fact,
as
a
result
of
this
case,
as
the
result
of
a
congressional
oversight
committee
investigation
which
followed
shortly
thereafter,
the
ncaa
has
changed
many
of
their
rules
with
respect
to
this
type
of
investigation.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
proceeding
against
the
university?
i
frankly
don't
know
the
answer.
the
university's
under
injunction
not
to
suspend
tarkanian.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
yes,
it
must.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
no,
that
may
be
just
private
activity,
that
may
be
just
private
activity.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
because
then
mr.
tarkanian
has
not...
his
property
right
has
not
been
protected.
he's
been
denied
due
process
of
law.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
the
ncaa
was
really
the
moving
party
here.
the
ncaa
is
really
responsible
for
this
denial
of
due
process
to
coach
tarkanian.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
i
submit
that
would
be
a
meaningless
remedy,
and
that
the
injunction
against
the
ncaa
should
be--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
--his
due
process
rights
were
violated.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
also
substantive.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
because
there
was
no
basis
for
the
findings,
the
court
found
that
they
had
been
substantively
violated.
