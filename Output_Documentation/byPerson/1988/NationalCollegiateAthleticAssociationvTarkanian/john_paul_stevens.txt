even
if
they
did...
even
if
the
university
suspended
him
for
violating
a
university
rule,
that
might
make
the
university
a
state
actor,
but
i
don't
know
why
that
makes
ncaa
a
state
actor.
what
relief
does
the
nevada
court
grant
against
the
ncaa?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
on
the
fee
point,
mr.
lee,
isn't
it
true
that
the
only
justification
for
the
fees
was
the
1983
action,
which
in
turn
depends
on
the
state
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
why
no
matter
what
we
do,
we
have
to
decide
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question
about
your
delegation
thought?
am
i
correct
in
believing
that
the
rules
that
the
ncaa
enforces
are
in
effect
minimums,
that
say
you
can
only
pay
a
player
so
much?
but
the
nevada
university
could
impose
stricter
rules
without
violating
its
obligations
to
the
ncaa,
couldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
hasn't
really
delegated
the
rulemaking
power,
it
merely
said
our
rules
will
be
at
least
as
strict
as
those
that
you
prescribe.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
were
not
binding
unless
the
university
agreed
to
abide
by
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand
you.
for
your
delegation
argument,
you're
not
really
relying
on
the
fact
that
they
delegated
rulemaking
power,
but
rather
that
they
delegated
enforcement
power,
is
that
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
who
made
the
rules
would
really
not
be
critical
to
your
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
nevada
did
not
make
them
any
stricter
than
they
had
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
saying
that
the
ncaa
had
the
authority
to
discharge
or
suspend
the
nevada
coach?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
did
not
have
an
option
to
withdraw
from
the
ncaa?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
had
a
legal
option,
didn't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
give
you
this
example.
supposing
united
airlines
tells
o'hare
airport
in
chicago
that
we
won't
land
here
anymore,
because
we
think
your
airport
manager
is
doing
a
sloppy
job
of
turning
on
the
lights,
or
something
like
that,
at
night.
they
just
say,
we
won't
do
it.
and
o'hare
says,
well,
we
can't
operate
without
united,
so
we'll
fire
him.
would
united
become
a
state
actor
because
they
have
enough
economic
power
to
insist
on
that
kind
of
result?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
what
you're
saying
this
association
has.
and
i
give
you
another
example
of
the
same
degree
of
economic
power,
and
you
seem
hesitant
to
say
it's
state
action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
any
time
a
private
entity
can,
as
a
condition
of
doing
business
with
a
public
entity,
insist
on
something,
why,
that
private
entity
is
a
state
actor?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
know
if
it's
all
that
gray.
