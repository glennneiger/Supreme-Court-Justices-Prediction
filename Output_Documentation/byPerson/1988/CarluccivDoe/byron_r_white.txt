what
authority
was
the
secretary...
or
the
agency
acting
under
at
this
stage?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
when
the...
when
the
agency
first
took
action
against
him
and
started
this
procedure,
what
did
it
purport
to
act
under?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
that
that
gave
the
agency
the
power
to
fire
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
agency
had
issued
regulations?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
is
what
they
were
acting
under?
their
own
regulations?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
it
becomes
cause.
justice
byron
r.
white
under
7532,
isn't
the
ultimate
decision
the
secretary
rather
than
the
agency?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
secretary
doesn't
get
into
the
act
under
the
for-cause--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
833
has
got
that
condition
on
its
use
that
none
of
the
other
procedures
would
be
adequate.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
has
happened
here
already
would
seem
to
indicate
you
never
could
satisfy
that
condition.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
agree
with
that,
but
in
this
case,
i
don't
see
how
you
could
ever
use
833.
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
secretary's
decision.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
did
his
pay
stop?
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
would
have
had
on
top
of
this...
if
the
agency
said
your
security
clearance
is
revoked,
then
you're
going
to
have
a
7532
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
which
that
decision
to
revoke
will
be
relitigated,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
proceeding
before
the
agency
was
under
370.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
anyway--
--talismanic
incantation
for
the
good
of
the
service
instead
of
a
talismanic
incantation
of
370.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
this
the
ground
the
court
of
appeals
used?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
said
7532
was
the
exclusive.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
didn't
specifically
rely
on
the
argument
you've
just
been
making?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
presidential...
did
you
say
a
presidential
proclamation?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
they
rely
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
would
think
you...
even
if
the
7532
argument
wasn't
good,
you
would
win
under
the
president's
proclamation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
you're
defending
the
ground
that
the
court
of
appeals
used.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
addition,
you
usually
start
with
that,
and
then
you
say
even
if
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong,
you
win
on
these
other
grounds.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
we
don't
have
to
deal
with
those
other
grounds
if
we
don't
want
to.
we
could
leave
that
to...
for
the
court
of
appeals,
couldn't
we?
we
don't
have
to
entertain
these
respondents'
claims
to
defend
the
judgment
on
some
other
ground.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
isn't...
it
might
help
if
the
court
of
appeals
gave
us
some
aid
on
this
other
regulatory
authority.
