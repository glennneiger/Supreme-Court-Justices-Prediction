mr.
kellogg,
would
you
tell
me
what
is
the
nsa
regulation
that
required
that
the
removal
be
for
cause?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
370.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
that...
is
370
in
the
appendix
of
the
cert
petition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kellogg,
may
i
ask
you
another
question?
seventy-five
thirty-two
says
you
may
suspend
without
pay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
it...
is
every
7532
suspension
one
without
pay?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
might
not
object,
but
they
wouldn't
be
following
the
statute
if
they
did
that.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
something...
and
doesn't
the
agency
head
himself
have
to
do
the...
invoke
this
procedure?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
he
did
that
because
under
the
court
of
appeals'
holding,
that's
all
he
could
do--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--because
they
eliminated
the
avenue
of
discharge
that
you
rely
on.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
really
there's
a
different
standard
under
7532
than
there
is
under
the
national
security
agency.
in
order
to
invoke
that
emergency...
not
the
super
emergency,
833,
but
the
regular
emergency...
it
has
to
be
necessary
in
the
interest
of
national
security.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
can
deny
a
security
clearance
without
meeting
that
standard.
all
you
have
to
find
is
it's
not
clearly
consistent
with
national
security
that
this
man
have
access
to
nsa
materials.
justice
john
paul
stevens
certainly
the
plain
language
of
7532
doesn't
say
that.
it
says:
"notwithstanding
any
other
statutes,
the
following
procedures
may
be
employed.
"
but
you
say--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--suspension
without
pay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
an
employee
suspended
under
subsection
(a)
of
this
section,
so
forth
and
so
on,
is
entitled.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
only
mandatory
language
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that's
your
position.
all
i'm
saying
is
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
doesn't
say
that.
that's
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
the
period
between
1959
and
1964?
they
hired
people...
began
hiring
people
in
1959.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
your
interpretation
means
that
during
that
period,
the
'59
act,
in
effect,
said
you
can
appoint
these
people,
but
you
cannot
fire
them
without
following
the
7532
procedures.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
kind
of
a
strange
way
to
read
the
'59
statute.
it
surely
doesn't
say
that.
they're
not
necessarily
in
the
civil
service
or
anything
else.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
just
gives
them
the
power
to
appoint,
and
presumably
they
could
appoint
and
say
you're
hired
at
will
or
you're
hired
on
a
one-year
contract.
i
don't
see
how
you
read
into
the
'59
statute
the
limitations
that
you
find
in
the
earlier
1950
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
where
do
we
find
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
we
don't
have...
is
it--
--i
think
we
have--
--the
court
of
appeals'
record
up
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
leave
that,
would
you
tell
me
again
what
the
citation
is
to
that,
what
you
just
read?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
question
to
be
sure
i
have
your
position?
is
it
your
position
that
in
order
to
revoke
a
security
clearance
in
the
national
security
agency,
they
must
follow
the
7532
procedures?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
must
do
it
every
time,
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
that's
your
position.
thank
you.
thank
you,
mr.
gill.
mr.
kellogg,
you
have
11
minutes
remaining.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it's
also
true
that
section
371
in
its
introductory
sentence
says:
"it
purports
to
prescribe
policies
and
procedures
governing
actions
to
limit
access
to
classified
information.
"
that
seems
to
support
your
opponent's
view
that
that
section
governs
the
procedure
for
taking
away
a
security
clearance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
are
you
saying
that
insofar
as
they
went
through
the
revocation
of
access
procedure,
they
did
follow
371?
they
didn't
violate
it.
but
then
when
they
removed
him,
they
were
following
370?
