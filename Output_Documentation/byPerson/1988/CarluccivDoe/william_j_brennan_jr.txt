well,
833
is
really
an
emergency
dismissal
provision.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
we
don't...
that's
why
it's
not
applicable
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
are
speaking
now
of
7532.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
your
position
is
that
it
also
is
only
an
emergency
provision
that's
not
applicable
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
were
you
suggesting
when
you
answered
justice
white
earlier?
that
there
might
have
to
be
a
remand
for
reconsideration
under
7532?
