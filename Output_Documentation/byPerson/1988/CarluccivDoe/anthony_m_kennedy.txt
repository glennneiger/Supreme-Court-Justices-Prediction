justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
counsel,
section
832
and
833
both
say
that
notwithstanding
the
section,
section
7512
and
7532,
there
may
be
terminations.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
doesn't...
doesn't
that
envisage
that
section
7512
could
on
some
occasions
be
used
for
national
security
cases?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
why
else
would
congress
have
mentioned
7512?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
they
specifically
said
7512.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
and
as
i
recall,
the
d.c.
circuit
didn't
even
cite
7512.
it
did
an
ellipse
of
the
statute.
