mr.
kellogg,
doesn't
chapter
371
of
the
regulations
say
that
it
applies
to
actions
to
limit
access
to
classified
information
and
to
suspend
or
terminate
personnel
for
reasons
of
national
security?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
looked
to
me
reading
through
it,
frankly,
like
this
was
a
371
proceeding
or
should
have
been.
maybe
they
proceeded
under
370,
but
were
they
violating
their
own
regulations
in
doing
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
was
a
little
troubled
because
reading
the
regulations,
it
did
seem
to
me
that
they
just
didn't
follow
their
own
regulations.
