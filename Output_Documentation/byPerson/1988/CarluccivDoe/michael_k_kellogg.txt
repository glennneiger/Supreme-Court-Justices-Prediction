mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
every
employee
of
the
national
security
agency
has
to
have
a
high
level
security
clearance.
that
is
a
statutory
requirement
for
employment
at
nsa.
the
question
at
issue
in
this
case
is
not
what
happens
to
an
employee
who
loses
his
clearance,
for
it
is
clear
that
he
has
to
be
removed.
nor
is
the
question
whether
the
clearance
decision
itself
is
subject
to
judicial
review.
the
application
of
this
court's
decisions
in
egan
and
webster
v.
doe
will
remain
open
on
remand.
the
question
at
issue
today
is
simply
what
procedures
are
to
be
followed
by
the
agency
in
removing
an
employee
who
loses
his
clearance.
after
briefly
stating
the
background
of
this
case,
i
will
argue
that
there
are
three
different
ways
to
remove
the
employee,
and
the
agency
is
charged
with
choosing
the
appropriate
procedure
in
light
of
the
individual
circumstances.
first,
the
employee
can
be
removed
for
cause
for
failure
to
maintain
a
required
clearance
after
following
all
the
ordinary
procedures
afforded
to
federal
employees
dismissed
for
cause,
including
mspb
review
if
the
employee
is
a
preference
eligible
veteran.
second,
the
employee
can
be
suspended
and
then
removed
under
the
summary
procedures
of
5
u.s.c.
7532
following
notice
in
a
hearing
if
the
secretary
of
defense
determines
that
the
suspension
and
the
removal
are
in
the
interests
of
national
security.
finally,
the
employee
can
be
removed
without
any
procedures
whatsoever
under
50
u.s.c.
833
if
the
secretary
of
defense
determines
that
that
action
is
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states
and
that
none
of
the
other
procedures
can
be
invoked
consistently
with
national
security.
well,
respondent
was
employed
at
the
national
security
agency
from
1968
until
1984.
in
1982
he
disclosed
to
nsa
security
officials
that
while
on
vacation
in
foreign
countries,
he
had
engaged
in
homosexual
relations
with
foreign
nationals.
he
subsequently
received
a
notice
of
proposed
removal
on
the
grounds
that
his
continued
access
to
classified
information
was
no
longer
clearly
consistent
with
the
national
security.
pursuant
to
nsa
regulations
governing
for-cause
removals,
he
was
advised
that
he
had
a
right
to
respond,
to
obtain
counsel.
he
was
kept
on
paid
status
pending
the
outcome
of
his
case,
but
was
denied
access
to
classified
information.
respondent
requested
and
received
a
psychiatric
evaluation
in
an
effort
to
demonstrate
that
he
did
not
pose
a
security
risk.
a
board
of
appraisal
was
convened
to
consider
his
case.
based
on
the
psychiatric
report
and
respondent's
own
statements,
the
board
concluded
that
respondent
had
shown
poor
judgment,
that
he
was
emotionally
unstable
and
that
he
was
living
beyond
his
means.
accordingly,
the
board
concluded
that
he
was
a
poor
security
risk
and
recommended
that
his
clearance
be
revoked.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
they
were
acting
under
dual
authority.
the
board
of
appraisal
is
provided
for
by
statute.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
it
was
acting
under
its
statutory
authority
to
hire
employees
without
regard
to
the
civil
service
laws.
that
authority
puts
nsa
employees
in
the
excepted
service
for
purposes
of
the
civil
service
reform
act.
now--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--that's
correct.
and
because
respondent
was
not--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--yes.
the
agency
has
issued
regulations
instituting
that
authority
and,
in
fact,
circumscribing
its
otherwise
uncircumscribed
authority--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--that's
correct.
nsa
has
provided
by
regulation
that
nsa
employees
can
only
be
removed
for
cause,
and
it
has
provided
procedural
protections
to
be
used
for
for-cause
removals
including
notice
and
opportunity
to
respond
and
be
represented
by
counsel.
it
is
those
procedures
that
were
invoked
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
chapter
370--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--of
the
nsa
regulations
says
that
removals
are
to
be
for
such
cause
as
will
promote
the
efficiency
of
the
service.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
yes,
it
is.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
no,
they
were
not,
justice
o'connor.
chapter
371
implements
procedures
for
clearing
access
of
employees
to
classified
information.
and
it's
correct
that
the
clearance
portion
of
what
happened
to
respondent
took
place
pursuant
to
chapter
371.
but
once
the
clearance
is
revoked,
the
question
is
how
is
the
employee
to
be
removed.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
and
then
it
becomes
cause
because
possession
of
a
clearance
is
a
statutory
requirement
of
employment
at
nsa.
chapter
371
provides
an
alternative
mechanism
for
removing
the
employee.
it
implements
5
u.s.c.
7532,
which
permits
the
employee
to
be
summarily
suspended
without
pay
and
then
subsequently
removed
if
the
director
or
if
the
head
of
the
agency
determines
that
it's
in
the
interest
of
national
security.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
i
think
that's
not
correct.
they
were,
in
fact,
very
careful
to
state
precisely
which
portion
of
the
regulations
they
were
following.
there
are
different
paths
here
and
which
path
you
take
depends
upon
the
language
you
use
in
notifying
the
employee.
if
they
had
said
we
propose
to
suspend
and
remove
you
in
the
interest
of
national
security
pursuant
to
5
u.s.c.
7532,
then
they
would
have
had
to
follow
371.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
correct.
it's
certainly
true
that
national
security
is
implicated.
the
reason
he
lost
his
clearance
is
that
it
was
no
longer
clearly
consistent
with
the
national
security
for
him
to
have
a
clearance.
but
the
reason
he
was
removed
was
for
cause
for
failure
to
satisfy
his
statutory
condition
of
his
employment.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
authority
of
the
director
of
nsa
to
remove
employees
for
cause
is
circumscribed
by
5
u.s.c.
7532
which
the
court
says
expressly
controls
terminations
in
the
interest
of
national
security.
and
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
proper
relation
between
7532
and
ordinary
for-cause
procedures.
seventy-five
thirty-two
by
its
own
terms
is
an
optional,
not
a
mandatory,
procedure.
it
states
that
the
secretary
may
suspend
and
remove
an
employee
pursuant
to
its
procedures,
but
it
does
purport
to
lay
down
a
mandatory
procedure
for
every
case.
it
also
says
that
7532
can
be
used
notwithstanding
other
statutes,
but
nothing
precludes
actions
taken
pursuant
to
other
statutes.
and
this
reference
to
other
statutes
only
makes
sense...
is
referring
to
provisions
like
the
csra
that
provide
protections
in
ordinary
for-cause
removals
that
are
not
available
under
the
summary
procedures
of
7532.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
i
don't
think
it
would
have
to
be.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
the
statute
seems
to
contemplate
that.
for
example,
in
part
b,
it
says
you
remove...
you
can
only
suspended
an
employee.
and
that
would
seem
to
indicate
that
the
suspension
is
what
starts
the
whole
process
going.
but
if
the
agency
were
to
choose
to
suspend
him
with
pay
or
merely
to
suspend
access
to
classified
information,
i
don't
think
anybody
would
object.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
correct.
the
head
of
the
agency
has
to
make
the
decision
himself.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
the
point
is
that
section
7532
is
not
an
employee
protection
statute.
it
sets
minimum
standards
to
be
used
in
suspending
and
removing
employees.
whether
the
agency
could
go
beyond
those
in
using
7532
is
an
open
question,
but
not
particularly
germane
to
the
question
at
issue.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
yes.
the
head
of
the
agency
has
to
make
the
ultimate
decision.
now,
subsequent
to
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
in
this
case--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--no,
that's
correct.
the
secretary
does
not.
subsequent
to
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
in
this
case,
the
director
of
nsa
was
designated
by
executive
order
as
the
head
of
an
agency
for
purposes
of
7532.
so,
in
any
subsequent
cases,
the
director
himself
would
be
making
the
decision,
not
the
secretary
of
defense.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
and
so,
it
would
have
to
go
back
and
he
would
have
to
do
it
again
under
7532
or
under
833.
that's
an
option
as
well.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
correct.
it
states...
it's
sort
of
the
most
extreme,
the
most
restrictive
provision.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
not
that
you
could
never
satisfy
it.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
there
could
certainly
be
cases
in
which
833
would
be
appropriate.
for
example--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--oh,
i
don't
think
833
would
be
appropriate
in
this
case.
i
don't
really
think
7532
would
be
appropriate
either
unless--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--that's
correct,
as
is--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--no,
we
do
not
have
an
emergency.
section
7532
is
an
emergency
provision
as
well.
the
legislative
history
of
7532
focused
on
the
lloyd-la
follette
act
and
the
veteran's
preference
act
and
the
procedures
provided
to
federal
employees
dismissed
for
cause
under
that
statute.
it
said
this
procedure
is
necessary
in
certain
extreme
and
emergency
circumstances
to
cut
through--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
i'm
not
saying
that
it
couldn't
have
been
used
here.
certainly
nsa's
mission
is
so
sensitive
that
any
employee
for
whom
it
is
not
clearly
consistent
with
the
national
security
for
him
to
have
a
clearance,
it
is
probably
also
in
the
interest
of
national
security
to
remove
that
employee.
but
i
think
the
three
provisions--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--if
the
court
of
appeals
were
upheld.
that's
what
they
said.
you
have
to
go
back
and
do
it
again
under
7532.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
and
once
that
you
find
that
it's
not
clearly
consistent,
the
statute--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--requires
the
employee
be
removed.
but
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
you
have
to
invoke
section--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--well,
no,
i
don't
think
they
do.
for
example,
in
a
number
of
agencies,
you
don't
even
have
to
have
a
clearance
necessarily
to
work
in
that
agency.
every
employee
at
nsa
has
to
have
a
security
clearance.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
i
think
that
might
well
follow,
justice
scalia.
the
three
statutory
procedures
for
removing
employees
in
these
circumstances
form
sort
of
a
pyramid
where
the
for-cause
procedures
are
the
base
and
cover
the
broadest
ground.
then
comes
section
7532,
and
finally
the
smallest
compass
and
the
most
extreme
case,
section
833.
the
lines
of
demarcation
between
those
procedures
are
not
clear-cut,
and
much
is
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
agency
to
choose
which
one
is
appropriate
in
an
individual
case,
but
as
a
general
principle,
the
for-cause
procedures
are
to
be
used
unless
there's
some
reason
why
they
shouldn't
be
used
such
as,
for
example,
the
employee
can't
be
told
the
precise
reasons
why
he's
being
removed.
perhaps
it
would
reveal
a
source
of
information
that
must
remain
secret.
in
those
circumstances,
section
7532
would
be
appropriate
because
it
provides
for
a
statement
of
reasons
only
to
the
extent
that
national
security
permits;
whereas,
under
the
for-cause
procedures
you
have
to
give
him
a
complete
statement
of
reasons.
the
premise
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
and
of
respondent's
argument
appears
to
be
that
he
would
have
received
more
procedures
under
7532
than
he
received
under
the
for-cause
procedures.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
correct.
the
secretary
of
defense,
under
the
prior
procedures
would
have
been
involved
if
7532
had
been
invoked,
but
he
would
also
have
been
suspended
without
pay
for
16
months.
he
would
have
received
notice
only
to
the
extent
consistent
with
the
national
security.
he
would
have
had
no
right
to
counsel.
he
would
have
had
a
single
hearing
of
unspecified
scope.
and
if
a
decision
were
made
to
remove
him,
he
would
have
been
ineligible
for
any
other
position
in
the
department
of
defense
and
for
any
other
job
elsewhere
in
government
without
opm
specifically
saying
that
he's
eligible.
now,
that
contrasts
sharply
with
what
he
actually
received,
which
was
16
months
of
pay,
notice
and
opportunity
to
respond,
counsel,
several
layers
of
intra-agency
review,
including
a
personal
meeting
with
the
director
of
nsa
and
a
recommendation
that
the
agency
try
to
find
his
employment
elsewhere
where
a
clearance
was
not
required.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
his
pay
stopped
on
the
date
of
his
removal
when
the
final
decision
was
made
by
the
director
of
nsa.
the
only
person
who
would
be
better
off
if
section
7532
became
the
standard
means
for
removing
people
who
lose
their
security
clearance
is
respondent
because
he
got
all
the
other
procedures.
everybody
else
would
be
worse
off.
there
are
any
number
of
reasons
why
the
agency
might
determine
that
someone's
access
to
classified
information
is
no
longer
clearly
consistent
with
the
national
security.
it
could
depend
on
a
number
of
mundane
factors
such
as
financial
problems,
alcohol
abuse,
mental
health
concerns,
carelessness
in
the
handling
of
classified
material,
or
simply
that
a
family
member
has
close
ties
with
a
hostile
country.
now,
in
all
of
those
circumstances,
the
employee
may
lose
his
clearance
and
his
job
at
nsa
because
nsa
cannot
tolerate
any
unnecessary
risk.
its
mission
is
too
sensitive.
but
we're
still
dealing
in
those
cases
with
a
fairly
run-of-the-mine
clearance
determination,
not
an
emergency
such
that
the
procedures
of
7532
have
to
be
invoked.
there
will,
unfortunately,
be
more
dangerous
cases
from
time
to
time
in
which
an
employee
has
to
be
excluded
from
access
to
classified
information
and
removed
immediately
and
in
which
perhaps
he
can't
be
given
a
full
statement
of
the
reasons.
in
those
cases,
section
7532
or
even
section
833
would
be
appropriate.
but
it's
important
to
note
that
it's
in
the
agency's
own
interest
to
provide
its
employees
with
as
much
protection
as
possible
to
avoid
any
arbitrary
or
unnecessary
removals
and
to
give
the
employee
himself
a
sense
that
he's
being
treated
fairly
because
a
disgruntled
ex-employee
with
classified
information
poses
a
grave
security
risk.
the
ultimate
irony
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
is
that
it
seems
to
mandate
a
more
severe
procedure
than
the
agency
itself
would
want
to
use.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
in
the
court's
decision
in
cole
v.
young,
the
court
compared
7532...
situations
in
which
use
of
that
statute
was
appropriate
with
ordinary
removal
procedures.
and
the
court
stated
quite
clearly:
"in
the
absence
of
an
immediate
threat
of
harm
to
the
national
security,
the
normal
dismissal
procedures
seem
fully
adequate
and
the
justification
for
summary
powers
disappears.
"
now,
the
mspb
and
the
federal
circuit,
which
have
wide
responsibility
for
federal
personnel
matters,
also
stated
in
the
egan
case
that
the
existence
of
section
7532
does
not
affect
the
availability
of
for-cause
removal
procedures
whenever
the
cause
might
implicate
national
security.
in
lieu--
mr.
michael
k.

--i
think
actually
the
agency
was
very
careful
in
choosing
the
procedures
that
it
followed
here.
the
notice
of
proposed
removal
to
respondent
stated:
your...
"it
appears
that
your
continued
access
to
classified
information
is
no
longer
consistent
with
the
national
security.
"
"therefore,
you
no
longer
meet
a
requirement
of
employment
at
nsa.
"
"therefore,
you
will
be
removed
under
chapter
370.
"
now,
it's
true
that
the
notice
didn't
say
under
the
for-cause
standard
of
chapter
370,
but
chapter
370
only
allows
removals
for
a
cause.
the
agency
was
quite
careful
to
follow
the
370
procedures.
now,
there
are
separate
procedures
under
371
for
implementing
section
7532,
but
the
agency
did
not
follow
the
7532
procedures
for
removals
and
dismissals
in
the
interests
of
national
security.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
it
would
only
support
the
proponent's...
the
opponent's
view
if
it
followed
that
once
you
revoke
a
clearance,
you
have
to
continue
and
can
only
use
section
7532.
now,
it's
true
that
chapter
371
implements
the
statutory
authorization
for
using
boards
of
appraisals
to
assess
whether
a
person
should
have
access
to
classified
information.
and
a
board
of
appraisal
was
used
in
this
case
and
determined
that
respondent's
access
was
no
longer
clearly
consistent
with
the
national
security.
therefore,
his
clearance
was
revoked.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
correct.
and
there's
nothing
in
the
regulations
that
precludes
that.
in
fact,
it
would
be
quite
extraordinary
if
nsa
in
its
own
regulations
were
to
bind
its
hands
and
give
itself
only
the
option
of
using
the
emergency
procedure
whenever
a
clearance
is
revoked.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
we
carefully
tailored
it
for
370.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
i
don't
recall
if
371
is
specifically
mentioned.
a
board
of
appraisal
was
convened.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
true.
respondent
said
that.
i'm
frankly
not
sure
if
anywhere
in
the
record
there
is
or
is
not
a
mention
of
chapter
371.
a
board
of
appraisal
was
convened,
and
a
board
of
appraisal
is
permitted
under
the
procedures
of
chapter
371,
but
the
removal
took
place
under
chapter
370.
and
the
fact
that
a
procedure
exists
under
371
for
removing
an
employee
summarily,
when
it's
necessary
in
the
interest
of
national
security,
does
not
affect
whether
loss
of
a
clearance
is
cause
for
removal.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
no.
if
it's
implementing
chapter
75...
or
section
7532,
then
you
have
to
follow
the
procedures
in
chapter
371.
counsel
is
quite
correct
that
the
delegation
of
authority
to
the
director
of
nsa
specifically
withheld
the
power
to
suspend
and
terminate
employees
in
the
interest
of
national
security
pursuant
to
7532.
as
a
consequence,
nsa
had
to
develop
separate
procedures
for
suspensions
and
removals
in
the
interest
of
national
security.
but
a
removal
for
cause
is
something
quite
different,
and
nothing
in
chapter
371
says
that
loss
of
a
clearance
cannot
be
cause
for
removal.
but
also
a
note
to
follow
up
on
justice
white's
point.
the
district
court
was
faced
with
the
question
of
whether
nsa
followed
its
procedures
in
this
case.
it
found
that
it
did,
that
the
removal
comported
with
nsa
regulations.
the
court
of
appeals,
in
light
of
its
statutory
holding,
did
not
reach
that
question.
if
the
court
is
troubled
by
the
regulatory
question
but
wishes
to
reverse
on
the
statutory
question,
the
court
could
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals
for...
to
address
the
question
of
whether
nsa
followed
its
own
regulations.
but
the
nsa
regulations
have
been
in
place
since
the
inception
of
nsa,
and
removals
time
and
again
take
place
for
cause
after
revocation
of
a
clearance.
the
agency's
own
interpretation
of
its
regulations
is
surely
entitled
to
some
deference.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions--
