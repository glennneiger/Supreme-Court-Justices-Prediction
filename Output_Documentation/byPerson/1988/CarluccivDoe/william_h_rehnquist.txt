we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
87-751,
frank
c.
carlucci
v.
john
doe.
mr.
kellogg,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you
say
this
is
not
a
national
security
case
as
defined
in
the
preamble
to
the
regulations.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--in
any
subsequent
cases
brought
under
7532.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kellogg.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
gill.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
before
that
carries
the
day
for
you,
you've
got
to
show
that
7532
is
the
exclusive
provision
for
removal.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you'll
tell
us
why
i
suppose.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
is
there
any
contest
about
the
revocation
of
his
security
clearance?
that
has
been
revoked,
hasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
this
isn't...
this
isn't
a
proceeding
in
which
it
was
sought
to
take
away
his
security
clearance.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
he
argue
in
these
proceedings
that
his
security
clearance
shouldn't
have
been
revoked?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
was
this
the
proper
forum
in
which
he
should
argue
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
under--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
seventy-five
thirty-two
starts
out
not
by
talking
about
removal
at
all.
it
talks
about
suspension.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it
only
gets
to
removal
in
the
second
subsection.
that
sounds
to
me
like
it
is
more
designed
to
deal
with
an
emergency
where
your
first
reaction
is
to
suspend
the
guy
and
separate
him,
and
then
maybe
later
you'll
think
about
removal,
rather
than
the
comprehensive
statute
governing
all
removals.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gill,
section
7531
that
precedes
7532
in
the
code
says
what
agency
shall
include
when
7532
says
the
head
of
an
agency.
and
it
lists
state,
commerce,
et
cetera.
and
then
at
the
very
end,
it
says:
"such
other
agency
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
as
the
president
designates
in
the
best
interest
of
national
security.
"
now,
that
doesn't
sound
like
an
employee's
bill
of
rights
really
if
the
president
can
bring
other
agencies
into
it
or
not
as
he
chooses
depending
on
national
security
considerations.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i'm
curious.
if
it
was
thought
to
be
something
where
an
employee's
right
are
to
be
protected,
it
was
left
to
the
president
for
national
security
consideration
to
expand
it
beyond
the
reach
of
the
agencies
that
congress
had
designated.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
know
it's
true,
but
it
doesn't
seem--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--it's
consistent
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kellogg.
the
case
is
submitted.
