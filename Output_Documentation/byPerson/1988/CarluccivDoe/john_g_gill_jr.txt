mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
decision
by
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
be
affirmed
because
of
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
its
legislative
history,
a
pertinent
executive
order,
the
pertinent
department
of
defense
directive,
nsa's
own
regulations,
and
the
clear
mandate
of
this
court's
trilogy
of
security
cases
in
the
1950's,
cole
v.
young,
vitarelli
v.
seaton,
and
service
v.
dulles,
which
we
submit
mandate
calling
a
security
case
a
security
case.
first
of
all,
i
need
to
emphasize
that
the
mandatory
procedures
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case
are
keyed
to
removal
or
termination.
much
is
made
in
the
government's
papers
about
suspension,
and
that,
indeed,
is
discretionary
when
you're
dealing
with
security
risks,
tactical
decisions
as
to
whether
to
suspend
now
or
perhaps
watch
a
person
and
see
what's
happening
are
proper.
but...
and
i
think
this
is
the
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question
about
was
he
suspended
without
pay
and
is
that
a
mandatory
procedure
to
trigger
these
rights.
the
suspension
is
discretionary,
but
once
you
get
to
removal,
these
procedures
are
mandatory.
and
the
mere
fact
that
the
government
paid
him
for
some
more
months
should
not,
we
submit,
obviate
his
congressionally
mandated
head-of-agency
review
rights.
and
as
is
conceded,
this
was
a
termination
case
from
the
very
beginning.
and
in
the
words
of
7532(3),
an
employee
is
entitled
to
the
following
procedures
before
removal.
and
as
the
d.c.
circuit
held,
we
were
entitled,
we
complain,
about
not
receiving
a
hearing
at
the
agency
authority
duly
constituted
for
this
purpose,
a
review
of
the
case
by
the
head
of
the
agency
or
his
designee,
and
a
written
statement
of
the
decision
by
the
agency
head.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
we
contend
that
when
you
terminate
in
the
interest
of
national
security,
which
i'll
get
to
the
record
and
why
this
case
is
such
a
case,
these
rights
are
mandated.
we
disagree
with
the
mere
option
argument
of
the
government.
when
you
have
a
security
case,
as
this
is,
a
termination
in
the
interest
of
national
security,
these
rights
are
mandated
by
congress.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
then
it
starts
with
suspension,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
and
suspension
is
discretionary.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
but
then
it
gets
to
but
when
there's
removal,
the
employee
is
entitled.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
well--
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
--well,
we
respectfully
say
that
this...
if
it
is
in
the
interest
of
national
security,
this
is
the
only
option
if
it's
truly
an
interest
of
national
security
case.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
well,
we
point
out
in
the...
most
of
our
record
references
are
to
the
court
of
appeals'
appendix,
which
we
understand
has
been
filed
with
the
clerk
and
circulated
to
the
justices.
the
initial
notice
at
court
of
appeals
82
started
out:
"this
is
a
notice
to
remove
you
from
your
critical,
sensitive
position.
"
our
point
is
that
it
was
a
removal
on
national
security
grounds
from
the
very
beginning.
the
government's
entire
for-cause
argument
depends
on
chapter
370,
which
is
their
inherent
authority
for-cause
procedures.
and,
of
course,
the
simplest
answer
to
this,
as
justice
o'connor
has
already
pointed
out,
is
it...
they
didn't
use
the
370
standards.
three
seventy
point
three,
which
is
found
at
court
of
appeals'
appendix
67,
subsection
3-2
reads:
"this
section
does
not
apply
to
a
suspension
or
removal
taken
in
the
interest
of
national
security.
"
the
government's
position
is
anomalous
in
the
light
of
chapter
371.1.
that's
at
court
of
appeals'
appendix
228.
"this
chapter
prescribes
policies
and
procedures
governing
actions
to
limit
access
to--
"
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
--this
is
not
in
the
petition.
i
think
this
may
be
found
in
our
brief
in
opposition
to
certiorari.
we
set
out
371...
and
i
think
that's
at
12(b).
no,
i'm
sorry.
that's
at
10(b)
of
our
opposition
to
certiorari.
and
the
very
first,
1.1
says:
"this
chapter
prescribes
policies
and
procedures
governing
actions
to
limit
access
to
classified
information,
suspend
or
terminate
civilian
personnel
of
nsa
for
reasons
of
national
security.
"
now,
this
is
very
important
language
because
the
government's
argument
seems
to
intertwine
cause
with
the
taking
away
of
a
security
clearance,
the
taking
away
of
access
to
classified
information.
this
preamble
to
371
says
371
applies
when
you
either
terminate
or
circumscribe
someone's
access
to
classified
information.
so,
by
nsa's
own
regulation,
this
is
the
procedure
that's
to
be
used,
and
this
procedure
later
on
mandates
the
7532
procedures:
appeal
to
the
agency
head,
hearing
by
a
duly
constituted
board,
and
a
decision
by
the
secretary
of
defense.
so,
by
its
own
regulation,
370
which
they
rely
on
is
not
applicable.
three
seventy-one,
whether
you
consider
it
a
mere
taking
away
of
a
security
clearance...
they
have
to
use
371
before
they
get
to
cause.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
we--
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
--well,
it's
unclear.
it
was
always
sought
to
remove
him,
out
he
was
being
removed
because
you
can't
work
there
with
a...
without
a
security
clearance.
and
the
government
says
this
is
cause.
we
say
you
take
away
his
security
clearance
in
the
interest
of
national
security,
which
i
think
justice
scalia
said
is
the
same
standard
as
the
7532--
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
well,
we
contend
that
there
should
have
been
371
rights
that
gave
us
these
rights
plus
appeal
to
the
secretary
of
defense.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
he
was
cut
off.
basically
i
think
the
proceedings
would
have
been
the
same
up
through
the
director
of
nsa,
but
then
we
would
have
had
another
hearing,
a
review
by
the
designee
of
the
secretary
of
defense
and
then
a
written--
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
"reviewed
and
readjudicated"
in
the
words
of
the
executive
order.
now,
there
are
certain
standards
set
up
in
these
regulations.
three
seventy
sets
up
the
familiar
standard
for
such
cause
as
will
promote
the
efficiency
of
the
service.
and
that's
in
section
3-4.
that
was
never
utilized.
we
never
heard
that
term
until
we
got
to
this
court.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
for-cause
as
it
would
promote
the
efficiency
of
the
service.
there
was
a
talismanic
incantation
of
370
a
few
times
at
the
administrative
level,
but
it
was
always
whether
his
continued
access
to
sci's,
classified
information--
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
--they
said
that.
there
is
a
doubt.
this
is
my
point,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
no.
i
asked
this
court
to
follow
the
mandate
of
cole
v.
young,
vitarelli
v.
seaton.
is
it
really
a
security
case?
what
test
was
used?
the
test
was
the
371
test.
is
his
access
clearly
consistent
with
the
interest
of
national
security,
which
we
respectfully
submit,
is
the
test
in
7532.
never
did
they
use
the
370
test
even
though
they
said
that
term,
that
number.
they
never
said
for
such
cause
as
would
promote
the
efficiency
of
the
service.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
because,
your
honor,
i
heard
that
for
the
first
time
in
this
court.
and
i'm
very
familiar
with
the
record.
you
will
not
find
in
the
record
any
mention
of
371.
that
was
never
utilized.
i
mean,
the
standard
was
utilized,
but
they
never
acknowledged
they
were
utilizing
it.
if
you
use
371--
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
yes,
they
used
the
371
standard.
my
point
is
that
when
you
use
371,
you
get
your
7532
procedures.
that's
in
that
regulation,
and
it
mandates
review
at
the
secretary
of
defense
level,
which
is
why
we're
here.
so,
the
fact
that
they
used
the
371
standard
is
very
important.
that
gives
us
these
rights
that
we
think
congress
gave
us.
if
i
could
refer
to
the
initial
letter.
it
had
the
standard
of...
it's
not
your...
your
continued
employment
is
not
clearly
consistent
with
the
national
security.
they
then
convened
a
board
of
appraisal.
under
the
1964
legislation,
a
purely
security
procedure,
which
deals
with
or
impanels
people
who
are...
have
expertise
in
the
area
of
security
and
advises
on
national
security
matters.
and
that
body
found
that
his
access
to
classified
information
was
clearly...
clearly
not
consistent
with
national
security.
most
significant
is
the
director
of
nsa's
own
decision.
it's
at
192
of
the
court
of
appeals'
record,
and
i
quote
paragraph
c.
"doe's
record
on
the
job
evidences
proper
security
awareness,
but
his
lifestyle
away
from
work
is
not
similarly
acceptable.
"
we
feel
that
under
the
for-cause
standard
promoting
the
efficiency
of
the
service,
this
is
almost
a
finding
that
it
does
not
impair
the
efficiency
of
the
service
because
his
on-the-job
performance
is
acceptable.
he
then
goes
on.
"i
find
much
attractive
about
doe
and
his
work
record
and
performance.
"
"i
also
find
him
significantly
flawed
in
his
off-duty
behavior
and
a
potential
security
risk.
"
this
was
a
security
case.
this
was
not
a
for-cause
case.
and
when
you...
when
it
is
a
case
in
the
interest
of
national
security,
the
government
has
to
contend
with
executive
order
10450.
president
eisenhower,
1953.
we
have
cited
in
our
papers
and
the
government
in
its
reply
brief
has
quoted
section
6.
now,
this
is
at
250
of
the
court
of
appeals'
appendix.
section
6
deals
with
the
discretionary
nature
of
suspensions.
and
executive
order
10450
is
by
its
terms
more
broad
than
7532.
section
5,
which
is
unrebutted
in
the
reply
brief,
is
mandatory
in
nature
and
mandates
the
7532
procedures
for
any
and
all
terminations
in
the
interest
of
national
security.
"whenever
there
is
developed
information
indicating
the
retention
of
employment
may
not
be
clearly
consistent
with
the
interest
of
national
security,
such
information
shall
be
forwarded
to
the
head
of
the
employing
department
or
agency
who
shall
review
or
cause
to
be
reviewed
and,
where
necessary,
readjudicate
in
accordance
with
the
act
of
august
26,
1950.
"
that
is
5
u.s.c.
7532,
which
the
court
of
appeals
held
we
were
entitled
to.
why
does
the
nsa
regulations
and
the
executive
order
seem
to
indicate
that
7532
rights
were
mandated?
we
feel
that
back
in
the
early
1950's,
when
the
executive
order
came
into
being,
when
this
legislation
was
passed,
there
was
great
concern...
the
korean
war,
the
cold
war...
about
security
risks.
there
was
also
a
great
concern
about
witch
hunts
in
government
employment.
people
wrongfully,
frivolously
being
ferreted
out
as
national
security
risks
without
basis.
we've
set
out
at
length
the
legislative
history
at
pages
23
to
34
of
our
brief,
both
of
the
1950
act
and
the
1964
act.
we
have
done
that
in
footnote
fashion.
on
the
whole,
it
clearly
shows
that
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
was
right
in
this
case.
there
was
a
legislative
compromise.
a
part,
a
significant
portion
of
congress,
wanted
civil
service
review
for
the
protection
of
employees.
another
part
of
congress
wanted
additional
power,
not
emergency
power.
this
is
not
an
emergency
act,
although
i
can
see
it
does
away
with
outside
the
agency
review,
but
greater
power
to
the
secretary
to
terminate
in
the
interests
of
national
security.
a
compromise
was
reached.
the
politically
responsible,
often
cabinet-level
officer,
accountable
to
the
president,
accountable
to
congress
who
could
be
called
down
to
legislative
hearings
to
say,
what's
happening
in
your
agency,
why
are
there
so
many
employees
being
terminated,
why
do
you
have
security
leaks
there.
a
high
level
that
would
show
an
impartial
tribunal,
not
the
people
who
were
trying
to
get
rid
of
the
employee
anyway,
but
someone
removed
but,
again,
consistent
with
the
values
preserved
in
this
court's
decision
in
egan
where
there
will
not
be
outside
the
agency
substantive
review
for
a
security
clearance.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
your
honor--
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
--your
honor,
the
statute
clearly
gives
the
authority
to
the
head
of
the
agency
to
delegate
it
to
a
duly
constituted
authority
for
a
hearing
and
a
designee
for
review.
he
does
have
to
sign
off
on
the
eventual
order.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
oh,
yes.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
and
he
can
take
the
advice
of
his
subordinates,
his
designees.
i
think
the
intent
of
congress
was
that
the
office,
insulated
from
direct
connection
with
the
people
making
the
initial
employment
decision--
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
--would
have
a
review
like
an
appellate
court.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
if
you
read
the
legislative
history--
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
if
you
look
at
2330,
which
was
quoted
by
the
court
of
appeals,
the...
it
said
right
now
there
is
no
appeal
to
the
head
of
an
agency
when
you're
terminated
in
the
interest
of
national
security.
and
it
said
this
new
legislation
extends
that
right
to
employees.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
however,
i'd
point
out,
as
the
government
has
in
their
reply
brief,
the
president
has
now
designated
the
head
of
nsa
as
the
head
of
an
agency
for
this
purpose.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
well--
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
--i
think
if
you
read
the
legislative
history,
your
honor,
you'll...
so
it
was
intended,
specific
reference,
and
we
have
set
it
our
in
our
brief.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
or
any
other
legislation--
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
i--
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
--for
the
same
reason
they
said
nor
any
other
legislation,
which
they--
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
--and
they
specifically
said
7532.
i
think
that
at
best
is
a
mandate
of
congress
or
an
intent
of
congress
to
say
we
want
to
make
it
clear.
there
is
no
review
of
the
extraordinary
emergency
power
in
833.
no
other
statutes
will
get
in
the
way
of
it.
i
don't
think
you
can
read
what
the
government
read
in
that
there
exists
an
option.
in
fact,
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
took
just...
i
mean,
the
d.c.
circuit
took
just
the
converse.
they
said
the
mere
mention
of
7532
shows
that
they
had
to
remove
that
to
demonstrate
that
833...
that
7532
was
not
mandated.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
but
my
point
is
i
don't
think
it
means
an
option.
and
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
that
act,
the
1964
act,
you
see
congressmen
saying
as
long
as
this
new
legislation
doesn't
get
in
the
way
of
the
ordinary
appeal
rights.
and
we've
set
that
out
by
way
of
footnote
in
our
brief.
to
analyze
the
competing
contentions
in
this
case,
the
government
argues
that
you
have
a
general
power
to
terminate
which
is
inherent
from
the
power
to
hire.
and
they
can
use
it
if
they
rely
on
it.
we
argue
that
congress
has
given
a
specific
focus
to
national
security
cases
of
termination
in
the
interests
of
national
security,
and
in
those
cases
there
shall
be
these
procedural
reviews.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
these
are
only
removals
in
the
interests
of
national
security.
we
have
kind
of
an
unusual
situation
here,
your
honor,
because
everyone
has
to
be
cleared
at
nsa
to
work
there.
this
is
the
1964
legislation.
i
don't
think
we
necessarily
had
this
situation
in
1950
when
congress
acted.
but--
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
you
can
suspend,
but
you
can't--
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
--the
'59
statute
says
nothing
about
termination.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
respectfully,
your
honor,
i
don't
do
it;
the
department
of
defense
does
it.
and
i'd
like
to
quote
5100.23.
that's
the
department
of
defense
directive
which
gave--
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
--it's
at
the
court
of
appeals'
record
62.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
well,
i
was
assured.
it
was
the
solicitor
general's
idea,
and
i
was
assured
it
was
distributed.
i'm
sorry.
but
in
most
brief...
both
briefs,
most
of
the
references
are
to
that.
but
that
is
the
delegation
of
authority
under
the
'59
act
from
the
secretary
of
defense
to
the
director
of
nsa.
and
if
i
can
quote
paragraph
10
where
these
are
the
different...
"authorize
the
suspension,
but
not
to
terminate
the
services
of
an
employee
in
the
interest
of
national
security
in
positions
within
the
nsa,
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of.
"
and
it
goes
on
and
it
cites
statutory
authority,
including
7532.
now,
the
government
argues
that--
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
--this
is
the
department
of
defense
directive
5100.23,
and
it's
at
page
62
of
the
court
of
appeals'
appendix.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
and
this
is
the
delegation
of
authority
in
this
regard
from
the
secretary
of
defense
to
the
director
of
nsa
pursuant
to
this
act.
and
clearly,
if
we
use
principles
of
the
english
grammar,
when
something
set
off
by
commas,
he
withheld
to
himself
the
power
to
terminate
the
services
of
an
employee
in
the
interests
of
national
security
for
positions
at
nsa.
and
this
defeats
totally
the
government's
argument
on
inherent
authority
because
of
in
re
hennen
and
all
of
those
cases
say
the
power
is
inherent
unless
circumscribed
by
regulatory...
we
think
it's
also
a
recognition
of
the
congressional
mandate.
the
principle
we
espouse
here
is
not
a
startling
one,
we
respectfully
submit.
and
that
is
when
there's
a
specific
focus
on
legislation
that
overcomes
and
overrules
general
inherent
powers,
then
you
have
to
follow
those
procedures.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
they
did
not
focus
on
the
department
of
defense
directive.
they
did
say
what
i
just
quoted:
the
specific
focus
of
legislation
would
control--
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
--it's
mandated
when
there's
a
termination
in
the
interest
of
national
security.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
the
department
of
defense
directive?
no,
they
didn't
mention
it.
we
argued
it.
they
did
not
mention
it.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
they
did.
however,
that's
repeatedly
mentioned.
vitarelli
v.
seaton...
this
court
relied
on
it
to
mandate
compliance
with
states'
regulations
for
security
cases.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
your
honor,
we
win
under
the
statute,
the
presidential
order,
the
department
of
defense
directive,
and
nsa's
own
regulations.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
absolutely,
in
addition
to
the
others,
yes.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
i
suppose
not,
but
i
think
it
would
be
wise
to
do
so
if
there's
clear
regulatory
authority.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
well,
i
also
submit,
your
honor,
this
regulatory
authority
and
the
presidential
orders
are
manifestations
of
what
congress
intended
and
what
the
government
itself
thought
congress
intended.
to
get
through
the
logical
steps
that
the
government
makes
in
its
for-cause
argument,
you
have
to
say
a
security
clearance
is
required
at
nsa.
we're
taking
away
a
person's
security
clearance.
so,
he's
terminated
for
cause
because
he
doesn't
fulfill
a
qualification
of
employment.
they
come
right
up
against
the
procedural
wall
that
we've
been
discussing
here
when
they
take
away
the
security
clearance
in
the
interest
of
national
security,
and
it
triggers
these
procedural
rights.
i
see
i
don't
have
time
to--
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
--termination
in
the
interest
of
national
security,
7532--
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
--that's
the
equivalent
of
termination
in
this
case.
that's
the
equivalent
of
termination
at
nsa.
and
they
said
that.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
the
1964
act,
831.
you
have
to
have
a
security
clearance
to
work
at
nsa.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
and
this
was
recognized
administratively,
your
honor,
when
they
gave
them
the
notice.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
in
these
circumstances.
there
might
be
other
agencies
where
it
wouldn't
amount
to
termination.
so,
it
wouldn't...
it
wouldn't
amount
to
removal
if
they
could
put
them
somewhere
else,
but
they
can't
at
nsa.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
except
that
the
notice
says
we
are
terminating...
we're
removing
you
because
we're
revoking
your
security
clearance.
that's
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
and
that
is,
i
think,
to
subvert
the
intent
of
congress
and
the
intent
of
these
other
regulations.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
no.
we
have
the
statutory
requirement
and
we
have
371
which
triggers
the
7532
procedures,
nsa's
own
regulation.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
well,
two
responses.
this
court
did
limit
the
president's
authority
in
cole
v.
young
where
they
said
that
they
could
not...
kind
of
the
converse
of
this
situation...
they
could
not
obviate
a
person's
veteran's
preference
rights
by
making
hew
one
of
these
agencies.
and
also
the
court
in
vitarelli,
i
believe,
said
that
an
employee
is
entitled
to
these
procedures.
the
secretary
of
state
in
that
case
could
not
change
the
reasons
for
his
removal
by
saying
i
now
act
in
my
absolute
discretion.
you're
not
going
to
get
your
rights
under
regulations
7532
type
rights.
in
further
answer,
your
honor--
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
--absolutely
true.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
and
i
think...
i
think--
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
--i
think
the
initial
motive
for
the
legislation
was
to
expand
terminations
of
security
risks,
but
congress
mandated
a
compromise:
appeal
in
the
agency
for
substantive
review
at
the
secretary
of
defense
level.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
when
it
equates
with
termination.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
yes,
yes.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
and
that's
their
own
regulations,
your
honor.
three
seventy-one
says
that.
