justice
antonin
scalia
but
they're
different
standards.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
you
have
cause.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kellogg,
you
know
you're
going
to
be
arguing
in
another
case
that
it's
not
consistent
with
national
security
to
give
access
to
classified
information
to
someone
as
to
whom
it
is
not
clearly
consistent
that
he
can
have
that
information.
i
mean,
the
two
really
boil
down
to
the
same.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
where
you
have
a
security
clearance,
i'm
sure
you
would
say
that
unless
someone
clearly
can
be
trusted
with
access
to
the
classified
information,
it's
not...
it's
necessary
in
the
interest
of
national
security
not
to
let
him
have
that
classified
information.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
you
wouldn't
have
the
references
to
the...
to
the
petition
rather
than
the
court
of
appeals--
justice
antonin
scalia
but
371
covers
not
only
policies
and
procedures
to
terminate
civilian
personnel
for
reasons
of
national
security,
it
also
prescribes
policies
and
procedures
governing
access...
governing
actions
to
limit
access
to
classified
information.
and
what
the
government
says
it
was
using
371
for,
as
i
understand
it,
is
to
say
that
this
person
is
not
entitled
to
classified
information.
since
he
is
not
entitled
to
classified
information,
it
is
in
the
good
of
the
service
that
he
not
hold
his
job.
why
isn't
that
an
adequate
explanation
of
the
use
of
371?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
for
that,
they
did
the
wrong
talisman.
that
one
they
did
use
the
standard
and
didn't
use
the
number.
the
other
one
you
were
complaining
about,
they
did
use
the
number,
but
didn't
use
the
standard.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
congress
intended
as
a
regular
matter,
whenever
there's
a
security
problem,
including
a
clearance
problem
like
this
for
security
information,
that
the
head
of
the
agency
is
going
to
be
spending
his
time
case
by
case
determining
these
matters?
i
think
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
a
routine
matter,
not
an
emergency
provision.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
think
that
means
he
has
to
personally
understand
the
order?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
has
to
give
his
personal
attention
to
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
like
an
appellate
court.
and
you
think
that
that
was
the
routine
way
in
which
congress
intended
security
problems
to
be
handled
in
these
agencies,
personal
attention
of
the
head
of
the
agency.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
an
emergency.
that's
the
routine
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
would
be
extraordinary
if
that
were
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
agency
here
is
the
defense
department,
and
you're
talking
about
the
secretary
of
defense
who
has
a
few
other
things
to
do--
justice
antonin
scalia
--overseeing
all
security
problems
and
clearances
in
the
entire
defense
department.
justice
antonin
scalia
good
thing,
but
even
that
person
i
assume
has
other
responsibilities
that
might
better
occupy
his
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
a
routine
matter,
i
mean,
i
could
understand
as
an
emergency.
if
you
want
to
get
rid
of
somebody
quickly,
which
is
how
i
understand
this
provision,
you
might
make
him,
if
you
want
to
do
it
quickly...
make
him
do
it
personally,
but
not
as
a
routine
matter.
isn't
it...
it's
such
an
implausible
intent
on
the
part
of
congress.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that?
when
they
take
away
the
security
clearance
in
the
interest
of
national
security,
what
is
triggered?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
we
weren't
talking
termination;
we're
talking
about
taking
away
a
security
clearance.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
what
says
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
know,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
is
crucial
to
your
case
is
that
taking
away
a
security
clearance
is
ipso
facto
treated
by
these
statutes
as
the
equivalent
of
termination.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
that
that's
self-evident
to
me
that
the
two
under
the
statutory
scheme
are
to
be
treated
the
same.
security
clearance
is
one
thing;
termination
is
another.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
understand,
but
what
we're
doing
is
revoking
your
security
clearance,
and
since
you
don't
have
a
security
clearance,
you
can't
hold
this
job.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
a
regulation
that
says
that,
that
revoking
a
security
clearance
is
the
same
as
termination?
justice
antonin
scalia
part
of
mr.
gill's
argument,
mr.
kellogg,
is
that
even
if
you
could
have
proceeded
under
one
of
these
other
provisions,
you
didn't.
and
i
must
say
he
does
seem
to
make
a
point
that
you
were
proceeding
under
371
which
is
not
the
for-cause
removal
procedure.
is
that
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
unfortunately
this
combination
of
370
and
371
is
contradicted
by
the
very
first
section
of
371
which
reads:
"scope.
"
"this
chapter
prescribes
policies
and
procedures
governing
actions
to
limit
access
to
classified
information,
suspend
and/or
terminate
civilian
personnel
of
the
nsa,
central
security
service,
for
reasons
of
national
security.
"
"such
actions
for
reasons
other
than
national.
"
--other
than
national...
"security
are
processed
in
accordance
with
chapter
370.
"
and
yet,
you
purport
to
be
going
under
371
and
370.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--this
thing
says
it's
a
dichotomy.
if
it's
for
national
security,
it's
under
371;
if
it's
other
than
national
security,
it's
under
370.
