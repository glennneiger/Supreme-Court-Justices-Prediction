87-1303,
allegheny
pittsburgh
coal
company
v.
county
commission
of
webster
county,
and
a
companion
case.
mr.
prettyman,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
prettyman,
are
you
suggesting
that
if
there's
a
sale
of
a
piece
of
property,
the
assessor
has
to
go
in
and
revalue
all
the
adjoining
property
right
then?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
a
matter
of
west
virginia
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
a
federal
constitutional
duty?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
must
she
rush
in
every
year?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i
mean
as
a
matter...
you
are
talking
about
a
matter
of
federal
equal
protection
doctrine,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
these
claims
made
to
the
supreme
court
of
west
virginia,
mr.
prettyman?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
were
these
claims
of
statutory
and
constitutional,
of
state
constitutional
violation
made
to
the
supreme
court
of
west
virginia?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean
in
this
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i
asked
you
not
what
kind
of
a
decision
it
came
down
with
but
whether
these
claims
were
made
to
the
supreme
court
of
west
virginia,
of
state
statutory
violation
and
state
constitutional
violation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
i'm
not
asking
what,
what...
i'm
asking
what
claims
your
clients
made.
did
they
challenge
the
assessment
practices
here
as
being
violative
of
either
the
state
statute
or
the
state
constitution?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
supreme
court
of
west
virginia.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
they
rejected
your
claim.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.--
--well,
don't
we
have
to
take
it
as
given,
then,
that
at
least
so
far
as
the
supreme
court
of
west
virginia
is
concerned
there
wasn't
any
violation
either
of
the
state
statute
or
of
the
state
constitution?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
consecutively,
i
trust.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
prettyman.
mr.
ullrich,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
if
a
property's
highest
and
best
use
was
mining
coal
or
its
coal
reserve,
then
a
certain
acre
of
the...
acreage
of
the
comparable
property
would
be
expected
to
be
roughly
similar
in
value
to
these
value
of
the
property
in
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
the
stipulation
doesn't
cover
those
factors;
it
just
covers
geological
similarity?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
one
would
be
more
satisfied
with
your
explanation
if
one
felt
that
the
assessor
has
made
that
sort
of
a
determination
rather
than
really
doing
nothing
in
the
light
of
this
recent
sale.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
ullrich.
mr.
prettyman,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
say
assessed
doesn't
necessarily
mean
be
reappraised.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
prettyman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
allegheny
pittsburgh
coal
company
versus
the
county
commissioner
of
webster
county,
west
virginia.
the
petitioners
in
these
cases
are
coal
companies
that
own
property
in
webster
county,
west
virginia.
over
a
period
of
more
than
10
years,
their
property
was
taxed
significantly
more
than
comparable
properties
in
the
county.
these
disparities
were
solely
the
result
of
a
tax
assessment
policy
adapted
by
the
webster
county
tax
assessor
in
which
she
would
use
the
last
sale
price
of
the
property
as
the
value
of
the
land
for
assessment
purposes.
if
the
property
had
not
been
recently
conveyed,
she
would
carry
over
its
assessment
from
the
previous
year
and
occasionally
make
a
minor
adjustment.
a
petitioner's
assessments
were
far
higher
than
the
carried
over
assessments
of
comparable
neighboring
properties
despite
the
occasional
adjustments.
the
west
virginia
court
of
appeals
held
that
petitioners
could
not
complain.
their
property
was
assessed
at
no
more
than
its
current
value,
and
any
complaint
about
the
under-evaluation
of
neighboring
property
could
only
be
remedied
by
an
action
to
raise
those
other
assessments.
we
find
the
webster
county
assessment
scheme
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
it
creates
significant
assessment
differences
between
similar
parcels
and
does
not
equalize
them
in
a
reasonable
amount
of
time.
we
also
hold
that
petitioners
cannot
be
limited
to
seeking
an
increase
in
the
taxes
of
others
rather
than
the
reduction
in
their
own.
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
west
virginia
is
therefore,
reversed.
