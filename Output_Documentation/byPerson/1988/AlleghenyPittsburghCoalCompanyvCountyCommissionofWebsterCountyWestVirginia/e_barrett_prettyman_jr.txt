mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
poses
a
question
of
whether
a
tax
assessor
in
webster
county,
west
virginia
can
adopt
and
apply
the
so-called
welcome
stranger
doctrine
to
petitioner
taxpayers
in
a
way
that
results
in
discriminatory
taxes
on
their
properties.
the
welcome
stranger
doctrine
favors
long
term
residents
of
the
county
by
leaving
the
valuations
on
their
properties
essentially
as
they
have
traditionally
been,
as
they
have
been
on
the
rolls,
with
only
sporadic
and
de
minimis
increases,
while
valuing
the
properties
of
new
purchasers
at
the
prices
they
pay
for
similar
properties.
as
shown
in
this
case,
the
result
is
very
dramatic
disparities
between
the
taxes
paid
on
comparable
pieces
of
property.
now,
i
don't
think
i
need
to
review
in
any
detail
here
with
you
the
facts
relating
to
the
petitioners.
let
me
just
say
in
a
paragraph
that
in
1974
allegheny
pittsburgh
bought
7306
acres
of
land
in
webster
county
which
it
sold
to
east
kentucky
energy
in
1982,
and
in
1977,
the
shamrock/oneida
property
in
webster
county
was
purchased,
consisting
of
7783
acres
of
land.
applying
the
welcome
stranger
doctrine
to
these
sales,
the
assessor
revised
the
appraisals
on
each
of
the
two
sets
of
properties
to
conform
to
the
statement
of
declaration
in
each
deed.
in
each
deed
you
must
state
what
the
price
is,
and
their,
their
assessments
were
conformed
accordingly.
the
assessor,
however,
did
not
revalue
or
reappraise
any
adjoining
or
comparable
properties
either
then
or
at
any--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--the
statute
tells
the
assessor
to
revalue
property
at
its
true
and
actual
value.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
it
is
indeed,
and
consequently,
she
is
under
both
a
constitutional
and
a
statutory
duty
in
west
virginia
which
is
very
different
than
some
other
states,
to--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--her
federal
constitutional
duty
is
to
make
certain
that
there's
no
discrimination
between
like
properties,
and
if
they
are
going
to
value
at
a
current
value
those
properties
which
are
sold,
she
must
devise
some
system
by
which
she,
on
some
kind
of
current
basis,
revalues
other
properties.
we
don't
for
a
moment
say
she
must
rush
in
every
month
and
look
at--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--the
states
have
varied
on
that,
industry.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
what
we
say
is
that
on
any
kind
of
a
regular
basis
we
would...
whatever
the
circumstances
are
in
the
state...
in
some
states
it's
every
year,
in
some
states
it's
every
other
year,
and
in
some
states
it's
every
third
or
fourth
year,
but
at
least
if
there
is
a
good
faith
attempt
by
the
assessor
to
keep
up
with
current
market
value,
if
that's
the
standard
that
they're
going
to
use,
then
there
cannot
be
the
disparities
that
show
up
in
this
case.
but
you've
got
to
remember
now
that
she
didn't
even
attempt
this.
this
is
not
a
case
where
she
was
lagging
behind.
she
didn't
attempt
in
any
way
to
revalue
the
property.
this,
the
other
properties
have
not
been
revalued.
what
she
did
was
she
let
everything
sit
on
the
books
until
there
was
a
sale,
and
then
she
did
nothing.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
that's
true
or
not.
i
take
issue
with
it
simply
because
the
circuit
court
found
that
that
in
fact
did
not
happen,
and
the
circuit
court
was
looking
at
the
actual
records
of
how
properties
were
treated.
he
found,
for
example,
that
some
properties
were
raised
$10
and
not
10
percent.
he
found
that
35
percent
of
the
properties
weren't
raised
at
all.
but
even
if
you
take
10
percent,
even
if
you
say
that
in
the
three
years
that
she
purported
to
do
this,
which
was
in
'76,
'81
and
'83,
even
if
she
did
that,
you
get
nowhere
near
the
evaluations
that
you're
talking
about
for
our
property.
moreover,
that's
not
a
re-evaluation
of
the
property
on
the
basis
of
current
market
value,
which
is
what
she
did
to
us.
rather,
that's
just
simply
an
arbitrary
10
percent
raise
every
few
years,
and
the
disparity
remains;
the
disparity
remains,
because
we're
talking
about
disparities
in
our
case
are
from
32
to
35
times,
not
percent,
in
regard
to
east
kentucky
and
allegheny
pittsburgh,
and
8
to
20
times
the
value
in
regard
to
shamrock
and
oneida.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
sure.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
if
your
system
in
the
state,
which
it
is
in
west
virginia,
to
value
property
on
the
basis
of
current
market
value
and
you
are
in
fact
valuing
some
properties,
namely,
recently
sold
properties,
on
that
basis,
and
a
disparity
grows
because
of
the
system
that
you
simply...
that
you
just
stated,
and
in
fact
the
other
are
not
being
currently
market
valued,
then
you
could
indeed
have
discrimination,
unconstitutional
discrimination,
particularly
if
you
have
the
kind
of
disparities
you
have
here.
what
she's
done
is...
and
i
want
to
make
clear
now,
this
lady
testified
in
this
case
in
'81,
'82,
'83,
'84,
'85,
her
testimony
was
completely
consistent
as
to
what
she
did.
there
was
no
question
about
it,
and
she
admitted
it.
she
said
i
left
everything
on
the
rolls.
this
was
a
lady
that
was
in
the
office,
assessor's
office
for
27
years,
not
as
the
assessor
but
in
the
office.
she
said,
i
did
this
for
as
long
as
i
can
remember.
we
leave
everybody's
property
just
the
way
it
is,
and
then
if
somebody
sells
it,
wham,
you
get
the
new
price.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
sir,
but
i
want
to
emphasize
that
there
are
no
classifications
here,
either--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--could
be
but
you
would
test
it
under
a
rational
basis
test.
in
other
words,
let's
suppose
the
legislature--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--in,
in
that
case,
in
the
case
that
you
posited,
justice
kennedy,
let's
suppose
the
state
came
along
and
they
said
we're
going
to
make
two
classifications
of
property
owners.
we
are
going
to
make
those
who
purchased
recently
and
we're
going
to
make
those
who
didn't
purchase
recently,
and
we're
establishing
those
two
classes
under
state
law.
now,
the
reason
that
we're
going
that
is
x,
y,
z,
so
forth.
then
they
would
come
to
this
court
and
they
would
try
to
say
that
x,
y,
and
z
had
rational
basis
to
state
purposes
and
so
forth
and
they'd
have
to
convince
you
of
that.
now,
that
is
nowhere
near
this
case
because
under
state
law
in
west
virginia
you
cannot
have
classes
of
property.
you
have,
you
have
four
classes
that
relate
to
the
levy,
but
they
don't
relate
in
any
way
to
appraisal
or
assessment.
so--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--the
state
law
has
been
what?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
have
not
said
for
a
moment
that
they
could
necessarily
convince
you
of
this.
what
i've
said
is
that
the
case
would
come
to
you
in
a
different
posture.
in
that
kind
of
a
case
they
would
try
to
be
convincing
you
that
somehow
they
had
good
state
reasons
for
these
two
classifications.
now,
whether
they
could
convince
you
of
that
or
not
is
another
question,
but
certainly
that
is
more
akin
to
what's
happened
in
california,
which
i
think
is
a
very
different
situation
under
proposition
13
than
we
have
in
this
case.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
sure.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
what
i'm
saying
is
that,
that
it
is
conceivable
that
the
state
could
somehow
come
up
with
good
grounds
for
this
kind
of
distinction
that
might
persuade
this
court
that
it
had
a
rational
basis
and
the
state
could
do
it.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
state
has
not
in
any
way
purported
to
do
that
in
this
case.
it
has
not
created
any
classifications.
it
purports
to
treat
everybody
the
same,
but
in
fact...
and
in
fact,
has
to
under
the
constitution
and
state
law
of
west
virginia
which
says
in
the
constitution
that
taxes
shall
be
equal
and
uniform,
and
that
fair
market
value,
in
the
statute,
is
to
be
the
guide.
but
they
haven't
done
that,
and
they
don't--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--pardon
me?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
in
other
cases,
the--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--in
this
case,
the
supreme
court
of
west
virginia
come
down
with
what
i
consider
a
rather
odd
decision
because--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--there
was
no
claim
made
that
somehow
this
conformed
to
the
state
constitution.
what
they
were
saying
was--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--that
there
was
no
systematic
and
intentional
violation.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
we
argued
both
the
state
statute
and
the
state
constitution.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
we
certainly
did,
yes.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
they
rejected
it,
though,
on
only
two
narrow
grounds,
number
one,
that
there
was
no
systematic
and
intentional
violation,
without
explanation.
i
think
what
they're
saying
is
that
we
treat
everyone
alike
in
the
sense
that
if
you're
an
old
timer,
you
stay
on
the
books
as
you
were,
and
if
you
buy
new,
you
get
it
changed,
so
that's
okay.
and
the
second
ground
was
that
even
if
there
was
a
discrimination...
and
this
is
the
most
important
point...
even
if
there
was
a
discrimination,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
because
you
have
to
due
to
get
your
neighbor's
taxes
raised.
and
of
course,
that
in
itself
is
unconstitutional
under
this
court's
cases.
this
court
has
squarely
said
four
times
that
that
is
not
the
remedy
that
comes
out
of--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--well,
that's
why
i
began
by
saying
the
opinion
is
a
little
strange
because
this
is
one
of
a
series
of
decisions
in
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
of
appeals,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
they
have
been
quite
clear
all
the
way
along
that
in
fact
taxation
has
to
be
at
true
market
value
for
everybody,
for
everybody.
in
fact,
they
struck
down
a
statute
which
allowed
assessment
at
between
50
and
100
percent
of
true
market
value
because
they
said
that
allowed
variance.
now,
this
didn't...
this
case...
our
case--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--the
federal
constitutional
argument
is
plain,
i
don't
care
what
they
said.
and
that
is
that
comparable
equal
properties
are
being
taxed
at
totally
different
evaluations
and
assessments,
resulting
in
great
disparity
in
taxes,
and
you
go
back--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--absolutely.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
that,
that
this
court
has
held
in
a
whole
series
of
cases
that
even
if
your
value
is
a
true
and
actual
value,
if
comparable
properties
are
undervalued
so
that
you
are,
you
are
paying
disparate
taxes,
there
is
a
constitutional
violation.
we're
talking
about
the
sunday
lake,
southern
railway,
sioux
city
bridge,
cumberland
coal,
all
of
these
cases
which
we
cite
in
our
brief.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
guess
what
i'm
really
trying
to
do
here--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--what
i'm
really
trying
to
do,
justice
white,
is
to
distinguish
a
proposition
13
case.
there's
been
some
suggestion
in
the
briefs
that
your
ruling
in
this
case
would
necessarily
overrule
proposition
13,
and
i
don't
think
that's
true
at
all.
proposition
13
is
part
of
a
state
constitution.
it
comes
from
an
entirely
different
theory.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
because
not
even
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
has
come
forward
and
tried
to
tell
you
that
there
are
two--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--if
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
cannot
come
up
here
and
try
to
give
you
a
rational
basis
for
a
classification
which
they
don't
even
say
exists,
i
don't
think
it's
up
to
this
court
to
try
to,
with
great
respect
insinuate
yourself
into
state
law
and
try
to
dream
up--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--well,
i
would
be
awfully...
it'll
be
the
first
time
in
this
case
if
they
try
to
say
that
there
are
two
classifications
and
that
there's,
and
that
there's
some
rational
basis
for
the
two
classifications
because
neither
state
law
nor
the
state
supreme
court
did
it.
it's
just
not
a
matter
of
state
law
in
west
virginia
that
you
can
have
these
two
classifications.
every
single
case,
including
the
constitution
and
the
code
of
the
state,
make
it
clear
that
you
can't.
everybody
is
to
be
taxed
at
the
same,
assessed
at
the
same
rate.
that's
the
whole
point:
true
market
value.
now,
it's
interesting
what
they
tell
you
here
because
they
tell
you,
well,
the
code
requires
you
to
take
the
market
value
of
the
property.
the
code
says
something
a
little
different.
the
code
says
you
are
to
value
as
if
the
property
were
sold.
in
other
words,
the
code
doesn't
assume
that
property
is
sold.
the
code
tells
the
assessor
to
go
on
the
property
and
find
out
what
it's
value
is
if
it
were
to
be
sold.
that's
what
her
duty
is,
and
that's
what
she
hasn't
done.
she
takes
our
property
out
of
the
deed
and
she
doesn't
do
anything
to
anybody
else's
property,
she
totally,
flagrantly
violates
the
state
law,
and
then
what
results
are
these
huge
disparities.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
with
great
respect,
she
testified
for
five
years,
and
when
she
was
specifically
asked
the
question--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--she
did...
she
testified--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--i
was
getting
a
little
confused
the
last
one.
she
testified...
she
was
asked.
now,
you've
told
us
what
you
do.
did
you
intentionally
do
that?
was
that
part
of
a
plan
and
a
process?
and
she
said
yes.
so
they
can't
possibly
say
that
in
the
constitutional
sense--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--that
it
wasn't
systematic,
and
intentional.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
you
have
to
decide--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--no,
sir.
again,
with
great
respect,
i
think
that's
a
constitutional
question
as
to
whether
this
kind
of
discrimination
is
intentional
and
systematic,
and
you
can't
read
her
testimony
with
finding...
without
finding
that
it
is.
now,
i
do
want
to
take
a
moment
to
talk
about
comparables
because--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--well,
if
you...
all
i
can
tell
you
is
if
you
look
at
this
record,
there
is
no
conclusion
that
you
can
conceivably
reach
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
but
that
it
was
indeed
intentional
and
systematic.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think...
i
don't
think
that's
the
situation
we
have
here.
i'm
not
arguing
that
this
is
unconstitutional
because
she
violated
state
law.
i'm
just
telling
you
she
happened
to
have,
and
the
state
is
not
coming
forward
with
a
policy
to
sustain
its
discrimination
here.
the
problem
from
a
constitutional
standpoint
is
a
very
simple
one,
and
that
is
she
uses
one
method
to
tax
us
at
a
very
high
rate.
she
takes
comparable
property
and
she
taxes
it
at
a
much
lower
rate,
and
that
is
the
discrimination,
and
that's
unconstitutional.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
she's
following
state
law
or
not.
now,
i've
got
to
say
something
about
comparables
because
i
am
afraid
my
opponent
is
going
to
get
up
here
and
say,
well,
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
any
of
this
because
these
properties
weren't
comparable,
and
i
just
have
to
say
that
what
they
have
not
mentioned
to
you
in
their
brief
is
a
stipulation
that
they
entered
into,
and
the
stipulation
said
that
in
lieu
of
evidence,
the
properties
being
compared
were
comparable
properties,
that
they
were
substantially
the
same
geologically,
that
they
were
neighboring,
comparable
properties.
they
stipulated
as
to
what
the
issues
of
law
were
in
the
case,
and
nothing
was
said
about
comparables.
the
circuit
court
found
that
these
properties
were
comparable.
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
not
only
didn't
disagree,
didn't
disagree
with
that,
but
apparently
agreed
with
it
because
they
called
the
properties
comparable.
they
didn't
go
off
on
comparability.
there
is
evidence
to
that
effect.
there
was
a
stipulation,
and
most
importantly,
and
i
think
you've
really
got
to
concentrate
on
this,
is
that
the
assessor
did
not
compare
properties.
she
couldn't
have
cared
less
about
any
differences
in
properties.
she
said
it.
she
didn't
go
out
and
look
at
properties.
she
didn't
even
look
at
the
tax
commissioner's
guide
that
was
sent
to
her.
she
testified
she
put
it
in
a
drawer
and
forgot
it.
and
the
state
statute
told
her
she
should
have
locked
at
it,
used
it.
she
didn't
look
at
geology,
she
didn't
look
at
the
oil
differences
in
the
seams
and
the
coal
deposits
or
the
reserves.
she
didn't,
she
didn't
look
at
any
of
that.
so
how
can
the
state
get
up
and
say
well,
maybe
these
properties
really
aren't
comparable
when
the
lady
who
did
the
assessment
couldn't
have
cared
less
about
whether
the
properties
were
comparable
or
not
comparable,
better
or
worse?
she
paid
no
attention
to
it
whatever.
so
i
call
those
to
your
attention.
on
the
last
point,
as
to
the
remedy--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--well,
apparently,
according
to
her,
it
was
just
kind
of
arbitrary.
every
few
years
she'd
just
kind
of
raise
people
10
percent.
the
record
doesn't
support
her
on
that.
it
just
doesn't.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
circuit
court
found
that
if
you
take
the
actual
increases
that
she
made,
it
would
take
over
500
years
for
her
to
catch
up
to
our
assessments,
over
500
years,
they
were
so
minimal,
and
he
was
looking
at
the
actual
records.
he
was
looking
at
the
exhibits
in
evidence
that
showed
the
properties
and
how
they
were
increased.
my
point
is
that
whether
she
raised
them
10
percent
in
three
years
as
an
arbitrary
matter,
or
whether
she
raised
the
more
de
minimis
ones
that
he
claimed,
you
still
don't
get
up
to
us,
and
she's
still
not
using
obviously
the
same
system
in
regard
to
everybody
else.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
it
is
an
entirely
different
system
for
this
reason,
justice
brennan.
first
of
all,
west
virginia,
as
i've
indicated,
has
a
current
value
system.
i
mean,
they
start
from
the
proposition
that
you're
going
to
tax
people
at
properties'
current
value,
regardless.
california
starts
from
the
acquisition
value
system,
and
then
it
has
several
exceptions
to
it,
one
of
which
is
when
property
is
transferred.
they
try
not
to
tax
unrealized
paper
gains
whereas
in
west
virginia
they
do
tax
unrealized
paper
gains.
most
importantly,
in
california
the
system
is
based
on
the
constitution
itself
whereas,
and
as
i
say,
maybe
they
could
come
forward
sometime
and
give
you
some
reasons--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--all
i'm
saying
to
you,
mr.
justice,
is
that
if
california
eventually
comes
here,
they
may
look
at
the
history
of
proposition
13
which
is
imbedded
in
the
constitution,
which
is
very
different
from
west
virginia,
could
possibly
come
up
with
some
grounds
to
convince
you
that
there's
a
rational
basis
for
what
they
have
done.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
this
lady
in
west
virginia
has
done
something
totally
on
her
own,
that
is,
that
goes
in
the
face
of
the
law.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes.
i
would
certainly
agree
with
the
last
part
of
that,
and
i
see
that
i
don't
have
time
to
maybe
discuss
a
few
nuances
in
the
first
part
of
it.
but
just
in
regard
to
the
remedy,
i'll
just
say
four
times
this
court
has
said
that
when
this
happens,
you
do
not
relegate
the
taxpayer
to
trying
to
sue
to
have
other
people's
taxes
raised
because
you'll
never
get
it
done.
these
rolls
are
closed
on
these
other
taxpayers.
there's
no
way
we
can
ever
get
their
taxpayers...
their
taxes
up.
we
have
to
get
our
money
back.
if
i
may
reserve
my
time.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
just
a
few
brief
points.
justice
o'connor
and
justice
stevens,
in
regard
to
the
points
that
you
were
just
making,
you'll
be
interested
in
the
wording
of
the
west
virginia
code.
all
property
shall
be
assessed
annually
as
of
the
first
day
of
july
at
its
true
and
actual
value,
that
is
to
say,
at
the
price
for
which
the
property
would
sell
if
voluntarily
offered.
apparently
west
virginia
in
its
code
doesn't
think
it's
such
a
difficult
job.
justice
white,
you
were
asking
for
a
state
case--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--well,
it
has
to
be
reappraised
in
order
to
be,
in
order
to
be
assessed.
the
assessment
is
based,
is
simply
50
percent
of
the
reappraisal.
the
assessment
is
the
automatic
50
percent.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
but
it
has
to
be,
it
has
to
be
at
its
true
and
actual
value.
you
can't
determine
that
without
an
appraisal.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
that's
fine.
let's
have
her
do
it,
and
maybe
it'll
come
up
to
anywhere
near
where
we're
at.
justice
white,
you
asked
about
a
case
that
was
anywhere
near
this.
back
at
the
time
when
they
had
sort
of
a
moving
evaluation,
in
killen,
which
is
in
the
briefs,
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
said
equal
and
uniform
taxation
cannot
result
when
each
county
assessor
can
vary
assessments
up
to
50
percent
of
the
appraised
value
both
within
and
among
classes
of
property,
declared
it
unconstitutional.
in
regard
to
the
intimation
here
that
no
comparability
findings
were
made,
the
circuit
court
made
ten
comparability
findings,
and
i
will
cite
you
specifically
to
six,
just
to
16a,
24a,
72a
and
74a
out
of
those.
a
point
was
made
about
the
stipulation
being,
referring
only
to
geologically.
it
also
said,
exhibit
b,
the
comparables,
accurately
reflects
the
increase
to
neighboring
comparable
properties
both
as
to
assessment
per
acre
and
percentage
increase
for
the
period
'75
through
'74.
and
also,
the
circuit
court
not
only
was
banking
on
geological,
which
was
the
whole
point...
after
all,
we're
talking
about
coal...
but
also
had
maps
and,
huge
maps
here
showing
where
these
properties
were
and
so
forth,
they
were
adjoining,
they
were
contiguous,
and
so
forth.
and
finally,
let
me
just
say
that
please
remand
this
case
in
a
way
where
we
get
something
out
of
it.
you've
been
confronted
with
several
cases
recently
where
the
petitioners
went
back
and
thought
they'd
won,
and
they
got
nothing.
the
only
way...
we're
going
back
now
eleven
years.
the
only
way
that
we
can
possibly
get
any,
our
taxes
back
is
for
you
to
say
that
we
are
not
relegated
to
suing
somebody
to
get
their
taxes
raised.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
thank
you.
