mr.
prettyman,
you
mentioned

in
california
earlier.
justice

isn't
that
in
effect
a
legislatively
mandated
welcome
stranger
policy?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
if
welcome
stranger
is
invalid
as
a
denial
of
equal
protection,
as
you
are
arguing
today,
how...
why
isn't
that,
if
it
is
legislatively
mandated
as
a
welcome
stranger
policy,
equally
invalid?
