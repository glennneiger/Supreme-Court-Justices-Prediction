mr.
william
ullrich
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
court:
i
should
indicate
at
the
beginning
that
i
am
here
representing
webster
county,
and
webster
county
board
of...
webster
county
commission
and
not
the
state
of
west
virginia
as
my
client,
but
we
will
offer
to
this
court
a
very
serious
interpretation
of
state
law
that
we
think
is
accurate.
mr.
william
ullrich
i
don't
think
that
it
has
to
be
a
welcome
stranger
law,
but
to
the
extent
that
it
is,
it's
certainly
defendable.
it
is
not
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
mr.
william
ullrich
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
it
has
a--
mr.
william
ullrich
--justice
scalia,
there
are...
there's
more
than
one
relevant
law
that
applies
to
these
facts.
there
is
the
law
that
sets
as
a
goal
and
one
that
under
west
virginia
law
must
be
met
by
all
the
actions
of
the
assessor,
which
is
that
she
is
to
attempt
to,
in
her
actions,
to
determine
true
and
actual
value.
but
there
are
specific
guidelines
which,
if
she
follows,
may
result
in
some
systematic
discrimination.
we
do
not
concede
that
it
did,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
we
think
that
there
are
genuine
differences
in
the
values
of
these
properties,
and
i
will
address
that
in
a
few
moments.
but
there
is
no
inconsistency
in
the
position
that
state
law
says
accomplish
a
specific
purpose,
that's
your
goal,
but
i'm
also
going
to
create
some
procedures
which,
if
they
create
some
subclassifications
under
the
kind
of
analysis
that
this
court
acknowledged
in
prior
cases,
carmichael,
then
that's
a
legitimate
classification,
and
the
deference
that
this
court
gives
to
states
should
be
given
to
the
procedure
and
the
law
of
west
virginia.
in
fact,
that
should
be
construed
as
the
law
under
the
approach
of
the
national...
nashville,
chattanooga
&
st.
louis
v.
browning.
but
the
record
here
shows
that
the
petitioners
are
trying
to
take
the
actual
market
driven
differences
between
the
value
of
their
property
and
other
properties
and
wield
that
as
a
sign
of
discrimination.
i
think
if
the
court
looks
closely
at
the
record
of
the
finding
by
the
circuit
court
judge
and
the
justices
in
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
of
appeals,
you
will
discover
that
it
is
not...
the
factual
findings
and
the
evidence
do
not
preclude
this
court
from
concluding
that
a
reasonably
accurate
determination
of
true
and
actual
value
occurred.
i
would
focus
the
court
for
a
moment
on
the
decision
by
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
of
appeals
in
the
petitioners'
appendix
on
page
6a
where
the
court
indicates...
pardon
me,
on
page
8a,
your
honor,
the
remaining
case...
the
remaining
question
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
the
undervaluation
of
other
property
in
webster
county
was
intentional
and
systematic,
and
on
page
44a
of
the
appellates...
of
the
appendix,
you'll
note
that
the
court
below
never
made
any
finding
that
any
value
was...
any
property
was
undervalued.
it
simply
made
a
finding
that
in
the
court's
opinion,
comparable
properties
should
have
created
a
different
system
of
reaction.
so
the
fact
that
he
made
a
finding
of
comparability,
a
finding
that
i
think
is
not
a
term
of
art,
although...
or
should
be
a
term
of
art
to
have
the
consequences
argued
by
mr....
by
the
petitioners,
if
you
made
a
finding
of
comparability,
the
circuit
court
said,
then
you
had
to
go
on
and
have
some
other
procedures
or
else
you'd
violate
due
process...
violate
equal
protection,
excuse
me.
mr.
william
ullrich
yes,
but
i
need
to
explain
that
that's
why
i
said
that
a
comparability
is
being
used
in
different
fashions.
i
think
it's
quite
arguable
that
that's
the
case.
comparability
was
stipulated
one
time
in
1984,
comparability
only
insofar
as
properties
were
geologically
similar,
not
that
they
were
the
same
sufficiently
that
they
should
be
treated
identically
or
trigger
some
presumption
of
identity
under
equal
protection.
mr.
william
ullrich
in
the
context
of
the--
mr.
william
ullrich
--well,
but
to
construe
the
stipulation,
respectfully,
your
honor,
of
similarity,
of
geological
similarity,
which
is
the
limitation
that
was
put
on
the
stipulation
as
being
a
concession
of
identity
or
similarity
to
such
an
extent
that
they
should
be
treated
as--
mr.
william
ullrich
--well,
that's
exactly
what's
not
a
legitimate
conclusion
from
that
stipulation.
merely
because
it's
geologically
comparable
at
some
level
of
the
use
of
the
word
does
not
mean
that
there
are
proven
reserves
that
would
generate
marketable
strip
mining
or
coal.
being
comparable
at
one
level
of
similarity
may
be
very
consistent
with;
nevertheless,
the
geologically
comparable
minerals
in
one
tract
of
land
are
a
lot
more
easy
to
mine
because
of
their
location
compared
to
the--
mr.
william
ullrich
--on
the
face
of
the
stipulation
itself,
it
says
comparable
insofar
as
they
are
geologically
similar.
mr.
william
ullrich
and
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
was
in
fact
a...
not
a
stipulation
that
convinced
convinced
the
circuit
court
of
the
identity
of
the
values
enough
to
apply
a
remedy
that
the
true
and
actual
value
of
the
petitioners'
property
should
be
applied
to
these
"comparables".
he
was
reluctant
to
do
that,
and
that's
demonstrated
on
page
44a
of
his...
of
the
petitioners'
appendix.
he
said
that,
if
i
may
once
again
point
that,
point
out
the
language
of
the
court,
he
commented
not
only,
on
the
first
full
paragraph
of
page
44a
in
relevant
part,
the
differing
abilities
of
various
tax...
estate
owners
to
bear
the
burden
of
real
estate
taxes
based
on
prices
paid
by
the
wealthy
leads
the
undersigned
to
conclude
that
the
consideration
declared
in
petitioners'
deeds
should
not,
in
this
case,
serve
as
the
basis
for
the
assessment
of
all
substantially
similar
real
estate
in
webster
county.
apparently
the
court
did
not
conclude
that
the
owners
of
this
property
that
was
next
door
to
this
very
expensive
property
were
wealthy.
i
think
that
looking
at
it
carefully,
you
see
that
the
judge
himself
didn't
create
a
remedy
consistent
with
his
own
conclusions.
similarly,
he
indicated
that
it
should...
the
fact,
under
these
circumstances,
the
fact
of
similarity
should
not
generate
an
automatic
application
of
the
price
to
the
comparable
properties.
mr.
william
ullrich
absolutely,
your
honor.
in
fact,
we
need
to
recognize
the
three
relevant
facts.
one,
or
context
in
which
to
ask
that
question.
it's
not
asserted
or
it's
not
proven
that
the
assessor
deliberately
discriminated
against
any
particular
group
as
a...
having
intentionality
to
fly
to
a
specific
entity.
it
is
not--
mr.
william
ullrich
--that's
correct.
mr.
william
ullrich
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
ullrich
oh,
actually,
excuse
me,
i
misspoke.
it's
not
that
the
other
properties
were
not
revalued.
that
is
not
accurate.
the
assessor
assessed,
valued
and
was
obligated
to
do
so
under
the
statutes
of
west
virginia,
presumed
to
have
performed
the
law,
and
the
court
didn't
find
otherwise,
to
make
an
assessment,
a
judgment
decision
regarding
the
true
and
actual
value
of
every
property
every
year,
and
the
record
is--
mr.
william
ullrich
--that
is
one
of
the
factors
and
absolutely
correct,
your
honor,
she
did
do
that.
she
did
use
other
factors
as
well.
mr.
william
ullrich
she
did
not,
and
your
honor,
arguably
she
should
not
or
could
not
absent
some
indi...
some
notice,
some
knowledge
of
relevant
similarity
at
the
time
that
she
did
her
assessing,
her
discretionary
act.
and
in
fact,
that's
a
very
important
observation.
mr.
william
ullrich
whether
it
is
her
job
or
not,
your
honor,
justice
kennedy
brought
up
i
think
a
very
important
point.
if
she
didn't
do
her
job
well,
she
may
have
violated
or
failed
to
meet
some
minimum
standard
of
west
virginia
law,
but
that
does
not
amount
to
a
constitutional
violation.
mr.
william
ullrich
no,
your
honor.
equal
protection,
respectfully,
doesn't
guarantee
100
percent
accuracy
if
she
makes
a...
if
her
actions
individually
are
part
of
a
reasonable
scheme,
if
she
acted
reasonably,
nonarbitrarily
in
adopting
a
policy,
then
her
actions
aren't
going...
should
not
be
construed
to
have
violated
equal
protection.
the
fact
that
an
assessment
or
even
a
series
of
assessments--
mr.
william
ullrich
--you
say
can
you?
mr.
william
ullrich
yes,
i
think
so,
and
the
state
can
put
any
standard
it
wants,
but
i
think
that
on
the
record
before
us--
mr.
william
ullrich
--well,
a
state,
i
think
it
is
very
clear
that
the,
that
states
can
make
classifications,
and
those
classes,
those
classes
have
to
be
treated
under
the
equal
protection
analysis.
mr.
william
ullrich
west
virginia
certainly
classified
all
properties
as
having
to
be--
mr.
william
ullrich
--absolutely,
but
it's
not
precluded
from
having
some
subclassifications
under
the
carmichael
analysis,
and
in
fact,
the
system
that
they
create,
which
says
you
must
use
recent
values,
you
should
consider
the
commissioner's
report
unless
you
have
a
reason
not
to,
you
should
add
all
improvements,
and
you
certainly
should
take
the
presumption
of
the
last
entry
or
that
property
as
valid,
that
might
result--
mr.
william
ullrich
--that--
mr.
william
ullrich
--that,
that...
your
honor
put
your
finger
on
one
of
the
critical
concerns,
which
is
why
i
feel
that
it's
important
that
this
court
look
behind
the
conclusions
at
a
superficial
level
of
the
circuit
court.
that
egregious
difference,
if
it's
a
reflection,
if
in
fact
it's
a
reflection
of
real
differences
in
value,
that
the
petitioners
bought
the
property
they
did
and
they
didn't
try
to
buy
the
property
next
to
it,
then
it
would
be
a
horrendous
mistake
for
the...
bad
facts
make
bad
law...
for
this
court
to
treat,
to
treat
this
as
if
properties
that
had
the
same
value
were
treated
in
violation
of
equal
protection.
the
reality
of
coals
and
minerals
and
mountains
are
such
that
properties
right
next
to
each
other
can
have
geological
similarity
and
absolute
difference
in
value.
mr.
william
ullrich
that's
the...
we
should
start
off
with
what
is
her
job,
what
is
the
presumption,
what
are
the
presumptions
that
she's
burdened
with
in
performing
her
job,
and
under
due
process
she
can't
go
out,
and
in
fact,
had
she,
just
because
neighboring
property
was
worth
a
lot
more
and
was
geologically
similar,
she
tried
to
reassess
somebody
else's
property
based
on
that
information,
we'd
be
here
on
a
different
case,
a
violation--
mr.
william
ullrich
--well,
your
honor,
i
do
not
suggest
that
she
is
precluded
from
doing
an
excellent
and
exotic
job
of
assessing,
but
the
equal
protection
does
not
place
a
burden
on
her,
starting
with
a
statutorily
mandated
presumption
that
the
property
was
properly
assessed
in
the
previous
year,
and
a
duty
to
assess
each
piece
of
property
accurately,
that
she
should
somehow
explain
why
she
doesn't
treat
this
property
similar
to
or
the
same
as
other
properties.
mr.
william
ullrich
well,
i
think
the
discrepancies
in
value--
mr.
william
ullrich
--your
honor,
i
think
that
the,
that
the
market
tested
the
reality
of
the
value
of
that,
of
those
lands,
and
i
think
it
is
not
irrational,
it's
certainly
a
reasonable
estimate
that
some
of
the
land
was
worth
more
just
because
of
the
fact
that
it
was
purchased
for
the
price
that
it
was.
but
it's
important
to
know,
your
honor,
that
even
if
this
land
was
grossly
misvalued
the
actions
that
are
being
challenged
here
are
the
failure
of
the
assessor
and
the
board
of
equalization
and
review
to
raise
their,
their
valuations
from
the
presumed
accurate
ones
that
they
had
initially
made.
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
pointed
out
that
that's
actually
what's
being
challenged
here.
the
assessor's
decision
to
use
the
true,
the
recent
transaction,
the
recent
transfer
price
of
the
property
to
assess
petitioners'
property
was
not
unreasonable.
the
circuit
court
below
found
that
that
would
be
okay.
the
circuit
court
simply
said
that
having
done
that,
the
circuit
court
found
it
was
a
violation
of
equal
protection
not
to
raise
the
rest,
or
not
to
explain
why
the
failure
to
do
so
would
have
been...
was
not
arbitrary.
so
what
we're
really
testing
here
is
an
actions
of
an
assessor
and
the
actions
of
a
board
of
review
in
failing
to
believe
the
evidence
that
convinced
the
circuit
court.
the
assessor
and
the
board
of
review
heard
the
allegations,
the
complaints
of
the
petitioners,
but
knowing
the
nature
of
the
region,
knowing
the
nature
of
coal
properties,
knowing
their
duties
under
statute,
did
not
think
that
they
were
on
sufficient
notice
that
they
were
deprived
of
a
reasonable
conclusion
that
the
properties...
that
they
should
stick
with
the
presumptions,
and
unless
they
have
sufficient
evidence
to
convince
themselves
in
an
honest
way
that
the
other
people's
properties
have
increased
in
value
then,
according
to
west
virginia
law,
they
won't.
and
if
their
actions
were
neither
an
intentional,
deliberate
discrimination
against
particular
groups,
if
there
was
a
reasonable,
nonarbitrary
decision
by
the
assessors
and
the
board
of
equalization
review
to
use
certain
policies
as
indicated
by
the
government,
and
if
these
behaviors
are
part
and
parcel
of
a
statutory
scheme
that
results
in
unequal
valuations,
that's
not
a
violation
of
the
united
states
constitution.
that
would
be,
in
fact,
a
state
discrimination,
a
state
classification
of
techniques
that
in
some
circumstances,
or
even
predictably,
would
lead
to
differences
in
valuation.
by
the
way
that
would
only
occur
in
a
time
of
inflation
or
deflation,
but
all
we're
really
talking
about
here
is
the
court
says
to
the
assessors,
use
this
information
because
it's
very
accurate.
what
we
have
is
a...
petitioners
were
some
individuals
about
whose
property
there
was
very
probative
evidence,
and
it
was,
according
to
west
virginia
law,
and
properly
so,
considered
by
the
west
virginia
assessor
regarding
true
and
actual
value.
mr.
william
ullrich
no,
not
that...
not
as
stated,
your
honor.
there
is
west
virginia
law
that
says,
especially
at
the
time
that
she
was
taking
her
actions,
that
her
duties
were
primarily
ministerial.
the
court
changed
its
focus
in
the
late
seventies
and
early
eighties
about
what
the
relative
roles
of
the
county
assessors
were
vis-a-vis
the
state
tax
commissioner,
and
at
the
times
of
this...
these
transactions,
the
assessor
had
the
primary
duty.
but
it
was
in
the
context
of
a
heavy
recognition
of
a
ministerial
role,
and
there
are
clear
presumptions
that
i
think
read
in
pari--
mr.
william
ullrich
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
ullrich
as
stated,
i
think--
mr.
william
ullrich
--not
that
i'm
aware
of,
your
honor,
but
the
way
you
ask
the
question
is
important.
it's
not
that
this
property
is
to
be
assessed
with
a
different
purpose,
but
that
it
is
to
be...
but
that
all
properties
in
all
of
west
virginia,
if
there's
evidence
regarding
true
and
actual
value
that
is
generated
by
a
recent
sale,
should
be
given
priority
by
the
assessor.
so
that's
the
law
of
west
virginia.
that
is
clearly
the
law,
that
if
it's
there,
use
it;
don't
ignore
it,
not
try...
but
that
does
not
exempt
under
west
virginia
law
the
assessor
of
the
duty
to
use
it
in
a
uniform
manner
to
try
to
determine
a
uniform
value,
a
uniform
result,
which
is
accuracy,
true
and
actual
value.
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
the
court
before
today
has
as
its
most
appropriate
option
to
dismiss
this
action
as
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
that
was
improvidently
granted.
the
record
below,
as
i
think
justice
white
pointed
out
a
few
moments
ago,
is
a
factual
finding
that
is
determinative
of
the
issue.
it
is
settled
that
there
was
no
intentional
and
systematic
undervaluation,
and
absent
that,
there
is
no
case
that
should
be
considered
by
this
court.
the
court
should,
for
reasons
that
it's
articulated
many
times
in
the
past,
leave
facts,
as
it
did
in
sioux
city,
as
it
did
in
iowa-des
moines,
to
the
justices
of,...
to
the
judges
and
the,
ultimately
the
justices
of
the
west
virginia
supreme
court.
so
the
facts
are
settled.
if
the
court
looks
behind
those
facts,
looks
behind
that
conclusion
and
analyzes
the
evidence,
i
think
the
evidence,
as
i
pointed
out
before,
is
very
consistent
with
at
least
a
suspicion,
if
not
a
conclusion,
that
these
properties
were
not
so
similar
as
petitioners
would
have
this
court
treat
them
that
they
had
to
be
assessed
on
the
basis...
at
the
same
price
per
acre
merely
because
of
some
kinds
of
similarities.
third,
even
if
this
system
as
applied
in
west
virginia
was
discriminatory,
it's
not
prohibited.
mr.
william
ullrich
oh,
no,
your
honor.
it's
not
that--
mr.
william
ullrich
--equal
treatment
is,
but
not
what
you
just
said,
respectfully,
your
honor.
the
court
didn't
say,
oh,
this
isn't
bad.
the
court
said
this
didn't
happen.
i...
the
court
said
the
evidence
is
insufficient
to
support
a
finding
that
the
assessor
or
the
board
of
equalization
and
review
intentionally
and
systematically
did
an
act
that
would
result
in
an
unconstitutional
discrimination.
it's
a
threshold
issue.
so
the
fact,
the
predicate
facts
were
found
not
to
exist.
it's
not...
this
court
isn't
even
hearing
from
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
any
proclamation
about
whether,
had
they
done
so,
this
would
have
been
bad
or
good.
it's
just
that
they
didn't...
the
record
didn't
support
a
conclusion
that
the
assessor
did
what
she
is
alleged
to
do.
mr.
william
ullrich
well,
i
would
say,
i
think,
ion
fact,
the
reasons
aren't
there.
they
are
not
given.
but
i
don't
think
that
the
supreme
court
of
west
virginia,
to
have
its
factfinding
sustained
and
deferred
to
by
this
court,
needs
to
be
explained
in
the
written
opinion.
it
waxed
eloquent,
perhaps,
regarding
other
procedures
and
options
that
were
available
under
west
virginia
law,
assuming
there
were
some
inaccuracies
that
did
not
amount
to
a
constitutional
violation,
and
i
don't
think
this
court
should
be
seduced
by
misinterpreting
either
what
the
court
said
in
its
opinion
or
what
it
implied
in
its
opinion.
it
simply
pointed
out
that
having
found
no
facts
sufficient
to
make
a
constitutional
violation,
i'd
like
to
gratuitously
point
out
to
the
petitioners
that
they
have
options
to
fix
an
inaccurately
functioning
system
which
they--
mr.
william
ullrich
--and
systematic
discrimination,
and
in
the
paragraph
before
the
court
said
the
only
issue
left--
mr.
william
ullrich
--i
think
that...
well,
i
think
it's
a
fact,
but
let
me
demonstrate
that,
your
honor.
it's...
the
court
said
the
only
issue
left
for
us
to
decide
is
whether
there
was
an
intentional
and
systematic
undervaluation.
those
were
the
words
of
the
court.
intentional
and
systematic
undervaluation,
if
proven,
is
not
necessarily
a
violation
of
the
constitution.
the
constitutional
standard
really
is
intentional
and
arbitrary
discrimination.
so
the
court
made
a
finding
that
the
allegations
below
were
not
there,
systematic
and
intentional
undervaluation.
all
three
are
definable
and
provable
without
reference
to
any
legal
standard,
and
the
intentional
and
systematic
discrimination,
therefore,
is
a
conclusion
that
must
logically
follow
from
that
decision,
and
from
that,
of
course,
no
violation
of
equal
protection
or
a
violation
of
the
constitution
of
west
virginia.
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
point
out
in
closing
that
this
court
should
think,
but
what
would
happen
if
in
fact
petitioners
prevailed.
what
it
would
be
in
danger
of
doing
is
creating
a
kind
of
an
exclusionary
rule
that
would
benefit
large
investors,
large
mineral
property
owners
that
could
buy
properties
and
after
making
expensive
explorations
which
are
a
prerequisite
to
their
knowing
it's
worth
it,
and
rest
assured
that
because
others
won't
be
able
to
make
that
determination,
they
are
not
going
to
have
to
carry
their
fair
tax
burden
unless
the
county
goes
out
and
does
some
exotic,
complicated,
expensive
exploration
and
survive
this
exclusionary
rule
because
the
evidence
won't
have
to
come
in
against
them.
i
think
that
the
court
should
be
aware
of
the
fact
that
not
merely
webster
county
will
be
subjected
to
tremendous,
had
its
primary
source
of
revenue--
mr.
william
ullrich
--well,
i
cannot,
your
honor,
although
if...
west
virginia
would
be
the
first
if
the
court
ruled
in
favor
of
petitioners.
mr.
william
ullrich
well,
it
isn't
a--
mr.
william
ullrich
--it's
not
that
its
an
exotic
science,
your
honor.
it's
just
that
to
discover
true
and
actual
value
of
underground
minerals--
mr.
william
ullrich
--takes
expensive
exploration.
mr.
william
ullrich
and
i
think
more
than
she
had
as
a
matter
of
resources
available
to
her.
the
bottom
line
is,
your
honor,
that
the
county's--
mr.
william
ullrich
--well,
i
think
that
the
assessor,
not
having...
if
the
court
doesn't
find
that...
the
court
below
found
that
she
didn't
act
intentionally
or
systematically
to
under...
even
with
the
result
of
undervaluing,
there's
no
finding
anywhere
that
any
property
was
undervalued.
there
was...
nor
is
there
a
finding
anywhere
in
the
record
that
any...
what
the
true
and
actual
value
of
the
property
was
that
was
outside
of
the
petitioners'
property.
the
very
worst
that
this
court
should
even
consider
doing
is
to
remand
under
the
kind
of
reasoning
and
thinking
that
it
articulated
in
sioux
city
for
a
finding
of
what
the
value
was
of
those
properties
out
there.
or...
but
actually,
the
court
shouldn't
go
that
far
because
unlike
sioux
city,
where
there
hadn't
been
a
determination
of
the
basic,
the
relevant
facts
of
intentional
and
systematic
discrimination,
here
there
has
been.
the
court
should
dismiss
this
case
for
want
of
a
substantial
federal
question
on
this
rather
bizarre
record,
and
this
case,
the
court
should,
even
if
it
believes
all
of
the
conclusions
of
the
circuit
court,
in
view
of
its
own
doctrines,
affirm
the
court
below.
thank
you.
