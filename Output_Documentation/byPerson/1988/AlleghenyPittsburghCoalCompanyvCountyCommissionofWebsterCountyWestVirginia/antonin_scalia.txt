justice
antonin
scalia
there's
some
dispute
over
that.
i
thought
that
there
is
some
contention
by
the
other
side
that
in
fact
remaining
property
has
been
revalued
upwards
about
30
percent.
you
contest
that,
i
understand,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--would
it
be
lawful
to
have
this
kind
of
a
system?
we
have
evaluated
all
the
property
on
site
on
one
occasion
50
years
ago.
after
that
we
simply
increase
the
assessment
on
the
basis
of
the
inflation
index
for
the
area
in
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
except
that
where
a
property
is
sold,
you
have
a
more
reliable
valuation,
so
particular
properties
that
are
sold
you
reassess
on
the
basis
of
the
sales
price.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
sounds
like
that
airline
case.
it's
been
around
a
long
time.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
would
you
tell
me...
one
thing
i
don't
understand.
on
what
basis
did
she
make
some
minimal
adjustments
in
the
valuation
of
land
that
had
not
recently
been
sold?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
prettyman,
i
thought
you
have
a
quite
different
point,
which
is
that
if
a
state
wants
to
have
a
welcome
stranger
policy
and
that's
what
the
state
law
says,
no
one
is
being
denied
the
equal
protection
of
that
law,
so
long
as
it
is
applied
honestly
and
there's
a
rational
basis
for
it.
but
west
virginia
here
does
not
have
a
welcome
stranger
law.
it
has
a
law
that
everybody
should
be
taxed
at
current
valuation,
and
your
client
has
not
been
given
the
equal
protection
of
that
law.
if
this
were
a
welcome
stranger
law,
you
wouldn't
be
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
you'd
be
here
on
totally
different
grounds,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
could
you
tell
me,
just
so
we're
on
the
last
topic
we
were
discussing,
is
this
state
law
a
welcome
stranger
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
does
the
state
law
require?
does
state
law
require
all
property
to
be
taxed
at
current
value?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
does.
well,
that's
not
a,
that's
not
a
welcome
stranger
law.
a
welcome
stranger
law
would
be,
say
the
property
should
be
taxed
at
the
value
of
its
last
sale.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand.
did
you
stipulate,
as
counsel
stated,
the
comparability
of
the
parcels
at
issue
in
this
case
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
would
comparability
mean
in
the
context
of
this
case
except
that
they
were
of
comparable
value?
what
would
be
the
use
of
stipulating
comparability
in
any
other
sense?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
what,
they
are,
they
have
the
same
elevation
above
sea
level
or...
obviously
the
only
comparability
that's
relevant
in
this
case
is
whether
they
are
of
comparable
value,
and
to
stipulate
to
comparability
without
understanding
that
that's
what's
being
stipulated
i
can't
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
certainly
a
silly
stipulation.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
it
her
job
to
find
similarities?
i
mean,
you
say
the
similarities
have
to
come
to
her?
i
thought
it's
her
job
to
find
out
what's
similar
and
what's
dissimilar.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
that.
so
long
as
a
denial
of
equal
protection
is
done
by
a
lower
functionary,
it's
all
right,
it's
just
a
technical--
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
some
fun's
fun
but
you
can't
die
laughing
principle
involved
here.
i
mean,
there
can
be
some,
some
dissimilarity
that's
tolerable,
but
the
discrepancies
here
are
incredible,
don't
you
think?
justice
antonin
scalia
given
geologically
similar
land.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
ullrich,
on
this
factual
finding
point,
it
can't
be
the
case,
can
it,
that
so
long
as
the
state
courts
say,
well,
no,
we
haven't
done
anything
bad,
we
have
to
accept
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
a
federal
question?
isn't
the
fact
of
whether
there's
been
equal
treatment
or
not
equal
treatment,
isn't
that
a
federal
question
itself?
justice
antonin
scalia
no
facts?
what
facts
didn't
they
find?
they
had
facts
to
show
what,
intentional
under--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
that
a
fact
or
a
conclusion,
really?
justice
antonin
scalia
xxx...
increased
the
assessment
on
some
of
the
property,
she'd
have
more
resources.
you
could
hire
a
real
assessor.
[laughter]
xxx...
on
itself.
it's
a
wonderful--
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
assess
it
annually.
you're
not
saying
that
that's
necessarily...
you're
not
going
to
be
back
in
front
of
us
and
say
that
there
has
to
be
annual
reassessment
as
well
as
annual
reevaluation.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
can
make
your
best
guess.
maybe
you
can
do,
do
it
every
other
year
and
that's
close
enough.
