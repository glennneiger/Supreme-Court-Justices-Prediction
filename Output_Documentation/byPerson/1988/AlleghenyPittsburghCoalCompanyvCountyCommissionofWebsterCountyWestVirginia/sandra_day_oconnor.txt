but,
mr.
prettyman,
if
we
accept,
just
suppose
that
we
accept
the
finding
of
the
supreme
court
of
west
virginia
that
there
was
no
systematic
of
intentional
violation
here,
and
therefore
no
violation
of
state
law,
let's
say
we
just
accept
that,
then
what
is
your
federal
constitutional
argument?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it,
is
it
a
violation
of
the
federal
constitution
that
equivalent
properties
are
given
disparate
values
as
the
result
of
an
adopted
policy?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
i
guess
it
is
clear,
and
i
suppose
you
would
concede,
that
the
policy
of
the
assessor
was
to
revalue
based
on
current
sales.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
other
properties
that
weren't
sold
were
not
revalued.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
seems
to
be
clear
enough.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
assessment
was
made
if
there...
if
the
properties
had
been
sold
within
the
year,
then
that
sale
price
was
used
for
a
revalue.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
she
did
not
use
that
sale
value
to
go
re-examine
adjacent
properties.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
didn't
west
virginia
classify
these
properties
the
same
way
and
say
that
each
should
be
given
current
value
annually?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
at
current
value?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
the
problem
is
that
this
looks
like
such
an
egregious
situation,
actually,
i
mean,
you
have
properties
side
by
side.
they
have
coal.
i
mean,
they
are
there
to
produce...
their
highest
and
best
use
appears
to
be
coal
production.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
paper
increase
in
value
of
the
adjacent
properties
is
just
not
taken
into
account
by
the
assessor,
apparently.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
happens
every
day,
all
over
america,
in
every
tax
jurisdiction
except
apparently
this
one
in
west
virginia.
