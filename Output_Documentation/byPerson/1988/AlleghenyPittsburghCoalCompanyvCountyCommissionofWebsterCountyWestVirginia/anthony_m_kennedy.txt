justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
your
position
that
the
classification
used
here
could
never
be
adopted
by
the
legislature
into
a
constitutional
scheme?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
i'm
saying...
you're
saying
that,
then
that
this
could
be
a
constitutional
scheme
if
the
legislature
mandated
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why
isn't
it
a
due
process
argument
that
you
have
here
then?
if
we
have
that
is
de
facto
a
constitutionally
acceptable
scheme,
where
is
the
constitutional
violation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
still
not
certain
why,
then,
this
isn't
just
a
case,
if
we
can
assume
at
least
for
the
moment
that
this
could
be
a
constitutional
scheme,
why
this
isn't
just
a
state
where
the...
case
where
the
state
law
has
been
violated.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
has
been
violated.
if
a
state
may
reach
a
result
by
statute,
why
is
it
a
denial
of
equal
protection
to
reach
it
by
an
administrative
device?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
may
i,
may
i
go
back
one
more
time
then?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it,
then
you're
arguing
that
the
state
could
not
constitutionally
reach
the
result
by
statute
that
it
in
fact
has
reached
here
by
administrative
practice.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
cite
me
an
authority
outside
of
the
tax
area
where
it's
unconstitutional
for
a
state
administrator
to
violate
a
state
law,
even
though
the
administrator
reaches
a
classification
that's
otherwise
constitutional?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--can
you,
can
you
look
to
state
law
to
see
whether
or
not
the
official
acted
rationally
or
reasonably?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
there
can
be
an
equal
protection
violation
for
an
irrational
application
of
state
law.
