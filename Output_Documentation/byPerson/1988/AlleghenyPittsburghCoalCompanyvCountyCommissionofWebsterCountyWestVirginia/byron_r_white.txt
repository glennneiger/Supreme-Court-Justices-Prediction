justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
you
said
a
while
ago
that
it's
conceivable
that,
that
recently-sold
properties
could
be
treated
differently
than
properties
that
haven't
been
recently
sold.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't...
that's
what
you
said
a
while
ago.
conceivably,
a
state
could
convince
us
that
there
was
a
rational
basis
for
that
kind
of
a
classification.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
didn't
ask
you
anything
about
proposition
13.
if
it's
conceivable
that
a
state
could
have
a
rational
basis
that
would
pass
equal
protection
challenge
to
treat
recently-sold
property
differently
from
property
that
hasn't
been
sold,
why
isn't
the
issue
before
us
here
that
is
there
a
rational
basis
for
that
difference?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
said
this
doesn't
violate
state
law,
so
it's,
so
it's
in
effect
a
ruling
that
the
assessors
may
treat,
under
virginia
law,
west
virginia
law,
can
treat
recently
sold
property
differently.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
wouldn't
be
insinuating,
but
the
state
of
west
virginia
is...
we're
going
to
hear
from
the
state
of
west
virginia.
they
may
have
some
rational
basis
for
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
say
that
west
virginia
didn't
say
that
this
system
conformed
to
state
law,
but
that
it
said
there's
no
federal
constitutional
violation
because
what
the
assessor
did
wasn't
done
deliberately
and
intentionally,
and
hence,
no
equal
protection
violation.
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
we
just
have
to
ignore
what
the
west
virginia
courts
found
in
this
respect?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
a
finding
of
fact
under
our
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
apparently
the
west
virginia
courts
seem
to
have
read
it
and
found
precisely
what
you
say
it
couldn't
have
found.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
we
don't
agree
with
you?
suppose
we,
as
we
read
and
understand
it,
the
stipulation
was
or
the
finding
was
that
these
properties
were
comparable
in
actual,
for
assessment
purposes?
are
you
going
to
tell
us
why
it's
rational
to
treat
recently
purchased
property
differently
than--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
know
of
any
cases
in
west
virginia,
either
trial
court
or
supreme
court,
that
says
that
under
west
virginia
law
that
it's
quite
proper
for
an
assessor
just
to
increase
the
assessment
of
a
recently
sole
property
and
not
assess
comparable
property
any
higher
until
it's
sold?
that's
not
west
virginia
law,
is
it,
or
is
there
some
case
that
says
it
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
just
want,
whoever
is
responsible
for
enforcing
the
west
virginia
law--
justice
byron
r.
white
--is
there
any
case
that
says
in
west
virginia
that
west
virginia's
system
is
to
tax
recently
sold
property,
or
to
assess
recently
sold
property
differently
from
property
that
hasn't
been
sold?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
any
closer,
is
there
any
closer
decision
than
this
one
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
reasons,
the
reasons
that
the
west
virginia
court
gave
for
saying
the
evidence
didn't
support
it
are
really
pretty
thin.
