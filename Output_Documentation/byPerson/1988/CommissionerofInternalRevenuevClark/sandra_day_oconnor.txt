mr.
horowitz,
it
seems
to
me
that
possibly
the
government's
approach
in
this
case
divorces
the
boot
payment
from
the
context
of
the
reorganization
in
which
it
occurred.

i
think
you
need
to
keep
in
mind,
don't
you,
that
this
whole
thing
arose
out
of
a
reorganization.

how
much
of
a...
how
much
of
a
split
of
opinion
is
there
on
this
question?
the
tax
court
was
unanimous,
wasn't
it,
in
thinking
that
it
was
taxable
as
a
capital
gain?
