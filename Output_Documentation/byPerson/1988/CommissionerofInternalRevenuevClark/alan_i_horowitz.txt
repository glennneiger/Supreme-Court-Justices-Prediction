mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
a
statutory
question
concerning
the
operation
of
the
reorganization
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
for
transactions
that
fall
within
the
statutory
definition
of
a
reorganization,
the
code
provides
an
exception
to
the
general
rule
that
the
entire
amount
of
gain
or
loss
must
be
recognized
upon
the
sale
or
exchange
of
property.
on
the
theory
that
the
reorganization
represents
a
recasting
of
interests
in
a
continuing
enterprise,
not
a
sale,
the
code
provides
for
deferral
of
the
gain
or
loss
that
would
otherwise
be
recognized
on
the
transaction.
when
the
reorganization
is
purely
stock
for
stock,
no
gain
or
loss
is
recognized
at
all.
however,
when
the
transaction
also
involves,
in
addition
to
an
exchange
of
stock,
the
payment
of
cash
or
other
property,
what
is
commonly
known
as
boot,
section
356,
the
provision
at
issue
here,
comes
into
play.
section
356(a)(2)
provides
that
the
gain
on
the
transaction
is
to
be
recognized
up
to
the
amount
of
the
boot,
and
it
further
provides
that
if
the
exchange
has...
and
i
quote...
"the
effect
of
a
distribution
of
a
dividend.
"
then
it
is
to
be
treated
as
a
dividend
to
the
extent
of
the
recipient's
share
of
the
undistributed
earnings
and
profits
of
the
corporation,
and
it
is
generally
recognized,
and
respondent
does
not
dispute
here,
that
the
corporation
whose
earnings
and
profits
are
examined
in
this
connection
is
the
acquired
corporation.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
as
follows.
respondent
clark
was
the
sole
shareholder
of
basin,
a
closed
corporation
that
by
march
1979
had
accumulated
more
than
$2.3
million
in
undistributed
earnings
and
profits.
n.l.
industries,
a
major
corporation
whose
more
than
32
million
shares
were
traded
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange,
sought
to
acquire
basin
from
clark
in
the
transaction
that
ultimately
yielded
clark
more
than
$10
million
in
gain.
n.l.
offered
clark
two
alternatives
as
consideration
for
his
stock
in
basin:
either
a
complete
stock
for
stock
deal,
in
which
he
would
receive
425,000
shares
of
n.l.,
or
another
deal
in
which
he
would
receive
300,000
shares
of
n.l.
and
in
addition
$3.25
million
in
cash.
clark
chose
the
latter
alternative
including
cash,
explaining
that
he
needed
cash
to
pay
outstanding
bills
and
that
his
whole
livelihood
had
been
tied
up
in
basin,
and
he
didn't
want
everything
tied
up
in
n.l.,
where
he
would
run
the
risk
that
something
would
happen
to
n.l.--
under
section
356,
therefore,
clark
was
required
to
recognize
and
pay
tax
on
$3.25
million
of
his
gain.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no.
there
would
be
no
tax
at
all.
it
would
be
tax-free...
a
completely
tax-free
transaction.
the
bulk
of
the
gain
still
remained
tax-free,
however.
the
question
here
is
whether
the
cash
that
was
received
by
clark
should
be
treated
as
a
dividend,
and
therefore
taxed
at
ordinary
income
rates,
to
the
extent
of
the
$2.3
million
in
earnings
and
profits
that
clark
had
allowed
to
accumulate
in
basin.
it
is
the
government's
contention
that
the
boot
distribution
to
clark
in
this
case
clearly
had
the
effect
of
the
distribution
of
a
dividend.
a
dividend,
as
defined
by
the
code
in
section
301--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
the
idea
is
that...
the
idea
of
not
recognizing
gain
in
the
reorganization
is
that
it's
kind
of
paper
profits,
and
that
the...
since
the
taxpayer
is
continuing
his
operation
of
the
same
corporation
in
a
different
form,
as
long
as
he
keeps
it
in
stock,
it's
the
same
as
if
his
own
stock
had
appreciated.
he
doesn't
have
to
pay
tax
on
it.
he
hasn't
realized
anything.
but
once
he
takes
cash
out
of
the
transaction,
then
it
becomes
a
taxable
transaction,
and
he
needs
to
pay
tax
on
it.
the
code
usually
doesn't
let
people
take
out
$3.25
million
without
paying
any
tax
on
it,
when
it
actually
represents
gain
from
his
initial
investment.
so,
there's
no
question
that
the
boot
is
taxable
here.
the
only
question
is
whether
$2.3
million
of
it
is
taxable
at
ordinary
income
rates
or
at
capital
gain
rates,
and
that
turns
on
whether
it
had
the
effect
of
the
distribution
of
a
dividend.
a
dividend
is
defined
in
the
code
as
a
distribution
by
a
corporation
with
respect
to
its
stock
of
its
earnings
and
profits,
and
this
court
has
described
the
fundamental
test
of
dividend
equivalency
as
whether
the
distribution
to
the
shareholders
is
on
a
pro
rata
basis.
here
there
is
no
question
that
the
distribution
was
made
on
a
pro
rata
basis
to
the
shareholders
of
basin.
that
is,
clark
was
the
only
shareholder
of
basin.
now,
of
course,
the
distribution
here,
which
was
made
in
the
course
of
a
multi-corporation
reorganization,
is
not
literally
a
dividend.
that
would
be
impossible,
because
a
dividend
is
a
transaction
between
a
single
corporation
and
its
stockholders.
with
that
constraint,
however,
it
is
as
close
to
an
ordinary
dividend
as
could
be,
and
therefore,
it
had
the
effect
of
a
dividend.
remember,
the
reason
why
section
356(a)(2)
needed
to
be
enacted
with
the
terms
"have
the
effect
of
a
dividend.
"
is
because
any
money
that
would
be
distributed
in
the
course
of
reorganization
would
not
literally
be
a
dividend.
let's
look
at
what
happened
here.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
we
certainly
don't
dispute
that,
justice
o'connor.
but
as
i
was
saying,
the
text
of
section
356(a)(2)
is
that
you
need
to
look
at
whether
it
has
the
effect
of
a
distribution
of
a
dividend,
because
in
no
reorganization
would
the
distribution
itself
literally
be
a
dividend,
because
that's
a
single
corporation
transaction.
so
of
course
the
distribution
occurred
in
the
course
of
the
reorganization,
and
for
that
reason,
it
is
not
literally
a
dividend.
the
code
directs
you
to
look
at
whether
it
has
the
effect
of
the
distribution
of
a
dividend,
and
in
order
to
do
that,
you
must
compare
it
with
an
actual
distribution
of
a
dividend.
and
that
requires
a
comparison
to
a
transaction
that
necessarily
takes
place
outside
of
the
reorganization,
because
dividends
are--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
it
was...
it
was
a
review
decision
of
the
tax
court,
so...
judge
tannenwald
wrote
an
opinion
which
was
circulated
to
the
other
judges
and
no
one
dissented.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
said
it
was
a
review
decision,
so
there
was--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--it
was
written
by
one
judge
and
circulated
to
the
other
judges
with
no
dissent.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes.
yes,
it
was.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
it
was
unanimous,
although
i
should
say
that
i'm
not
sure
if
the
tax
court
was
sitting
here
today
they
would
still
vote
unanimously
on
it.
in
reading
judge
tannenwald's
opinion,
i
think
there
are
some
things
that
are
not
apparent
from
the
face
of
that
opinion
that
we
rely
on
somewhat,
and
that
wouldn't
have
been
apparent
to
the
judges
who
were
reading
it.
for
example,
the
fact
that
there
was
a
long--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--line
of
court
of
appeals
authority.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
the
court
of
appeals
was,
yes.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
in
this
particular
case,
the
array
of
judges
is
unanimous.
on
the
other
hand,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
there's
a
long
line
of
earlier
authority
which
directly
supports
the
government.
so,
there
are
many
judges
before
who
have
ruled
our
way,
and
in
fact,
dating
back
to
1934,
it's
a
pretty
well-established
proposition
that
a
pro
rata
boot
distribution
would
have
the
effect
of
a
dividend.
it's
only
in
this
case
and
in
one
other
case
back
in
1972,
in
the
eighth
circuit,
on
very
unusual
facts,
that
there's
been
any
deviation
from
that
rule.
and
i
should
also
add
that
it
is
a
rule
that
was
acknowledged
and
cited
approvingly
by
this
court
in
the
bedford
case
back
in
the
forties,
although
that
was
not
the
holding
of
the
case.
but
the
court
cited
the
lower
court
cases
on
which
we
rely,
and
then
extrapolated
from
those--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--i
think
the
commissioner--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--i
don't
think
so.
there's
a
few
red
herrings
that
are
floating
around
on
this
case.
one
of
them
is
the
so-called
automatic
dividend
rule,
which
is
something
that
came
out
of
that
bedford
decision,
in
which
the
court
had...
the
court,
in
approving
this
lower
court
decisions
that
had
held
that
a
pro
rata
distribution
to
the
shareholders
of
the
acquiring
corporation
would
always
have
the
effect
of
a
dividend.
the
court
used
some
loose
language
there,
and
after
the
bedford
decision
came
down,
some
people
read
it
as
establishing
the
so-called
automatic
dividend
rule,
which
is
that
every
distribution,
boot
distribution
made
in
the
course
of
reorganization
would
be
a
dividend,
even
if
it
was
made
on
a
non
pro
rata
basis.
that
view
has
been
rejected
by
the
courts
and
by
the
commissioner,
although
in
that
respect
you
might
argue
the
commissioner
changed
position,
because
originally
he
tried
to
make
some
hay
out
of
that,
i
think,
in
same
way.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no,
i
think
there's
no
question
that
there
was
a
pro
rata
distribution.
now,
if
you
look
at
it
from
after...
if
you
look
at
it
the
way
the
respondents
do,
they
construct
a
scenario
in
which
it
would
not
be
a
pro
rata
distribution,
but
i
don't
think
that
changes
what
is
a
fact,
which
is
that
the
money
was
distributed
on
a
pro
rata
basis
to
the
shareholders
of
basin.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
it
was
distributed
by
a
corporation
that,
within
the
assumptions
that
underlie
the
reorganization
provisions,
and
that
support
the
view
that
gain
will
not
be
recognized,
it
is
a
successor
corporation
to
basin,
a
continuation
of
the
original
corporation
of
basin.
so
it's
not
like
it's
another
corporation.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
if
there
were
more
than
one
shareholder
of
basin,
and
the
money
went
to
some,
and
not
to
others.
if
you
look
at
some
of
the
revenue
rulings
that
are
cited
in
the
briefs,
you'll
see
cases
where
some
shareholders
hold
common
stock
of
the
acquired
corporation,
some
hold
preferred,
some
hold
a
combination
of
both.
and
the
terms
of
the
organization
are
such
that
each
shareholder
doesn't
get
the
same
thing
because
of
those
differences.
that
would
not
be
pro
rata
distribution.
this
case
is
a
typical
one,
though,
no
question
about
it.
many
of
these
organizations--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
i'm
not
sure
what
the
temporal
limitation
would
be
on
it.
i'm
sure
if
the
contractual
provision
was
for
15
minutes
later,
the
stock
would
be
redeemed,
the
commissioner
would...
well,
what
you're
suggesting
is
i
think
a
transaction
where
there's
no
boot
at
all,
that
is,
a
pure
stock
to
stock.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
right.
i
think
there
would
be
some
point
at
which
the
government
would
challenge
that,
try
to
collapse,
transact
something,
which
it
wouldn't
but
i
don't
think
that
goes
to
whether
it's
a
pro
rata
distribution.
it
goes
only
to
whether
it's
a
distribution
at
all
in
the
course
of
reorganization.
if
there
is
one,
we
would
argue
that
it
was
pro
rata.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes.
the
earnings
and
profits
would
be
taken
out
from
basin,
and
wherever
basin's
earnings
and
profits
went...
in
this
case,
into
the
subsidiary.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
certainly
the
first
person
is
not
receiving
a
dividend.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
and
the
cash,
the
second
person
is
getting
cash,
and
it
would
not
be
a
pro
rata
distribution
to
him.
so
it
would
not...
it
probably
wouldn't
be
a
dividend,
although
then
you'd
have
to
see--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--oh,
it
does
make
a
whole
lot
of
sense,
justice
scalia.
the
whole...
the
earmark
of
a
dividend
is
what
we
ordinarily
think
of
a
dividend
when
at&t
takes
its
earnings
and
profits
and
sends
a
check
to
all
its
shareholders.
that's
what
a
dividend
is...
it's
when
all
the
shareholders
take
money
equally
out
of
the
corporation,
and
that's
what's
happened,
essentially,
in
this
case.
when
it
doesn't...
when
it's
not
distributed
on
a
pro
rata
basis
to
the
shareholders,
then
you've
got
something
else,
because
there's
no
basis
for
issuing
a
dividend
to
one
shareholder
and
not
to
another.
so
the
hypothetical
that
you
posit
is...
on
its
face
looks
like
something
quite
different
from
a
dividend.
this
case
does
not.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
the
way
i--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
first
of
all,
now,
i
think
the
answer...
it's
a
long
answer.
first
of
all,
we
don't
necessarily
say
that
you
have
to
hypothesize
a
redemption.
that
is
respondent's
construct.
they
argue
that
somehow
you'd
have
to
trade
a
redemption,
and
what
the
statute
says
is
whether
it
has
the
effect
of
a
dividend,
which
the
dividend
is
a
much
simpler
transaction
than
a
redemption.
and
we
say
that
you
look
at
a
dividend.
now,
the
simplest
way
of
looking
at
is
true,
as
if
basin
had
in
fact
distributed
this
as
a
dividend
before
the
reorganization,
because
basin
ceased
to
exist
as
an
independent
entity
after
the
reorganization.
but
our
position
does
not
depend
on
looking
at
it
before
the
reorganization.
this
is
explained
in
some
detail
in
my
reply
brief,
pages
7
to
9.
but
you
could
also
structure
the
transaction
somewhat
differently
the
way
the
minnesota
tea
case
that
was
before
this
court
was
structured,
and
that
is,
basin
could
have
been
kept
as
a
shell
corporation.
all
of
the
assets
of
basin
could
have
been
sent
to
n.l.
in
the
reorganization
with
basin
remaining
as
a
shell.
and
in
that
case,
the
consideration
paid
for
the
organization
would
have
gone
into
basin
as
a
holding
company.
it
would
have
held
the
shares
in
n.l.
and
it
would
have
taken
the
money.
it
still
would
have
all
been
to
the
benefit
of
clark,
which
would
remain
the
sole
shareholder
of
basin.
in
that
case,
if
basin
then
distributed
the
money
as
a
dividend
to
clark,
which
is
what
happened
in
the
minnesota
tea
case,
it
would
clearly
be
a
dividend.
there
would
be
no
argument
that
it
wouldn't
be
a
dividend.
yet
everybody
would
end
up
in
exactly
the
same
place
as
they
are
now.
so,
whether
you
compare
what
happened
here
on
the
reorganization
to
a
pre-reorganization
distribution
by
basin,
or
if
you
compare
it
to
the
post-reorganization
transaction,
that
i
just
described,
in
either
case
there,
it
is
exactly
comparable
to
a
dividend.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
again,
the
statues
require
some
degree
of
hypothetical
construct,
because
it
asks
the
question:
is
this
equivalent
to
a
dividend?
and
the
dividend
is
a
transaction
that
occurs
outside
reorganization.
it's
a
transaction
that
occurs
between
a
single
corporation
and
a
shareholder.
so,
the
statue,
in
requiring
a
comparison,
requires
you
to
look
at
some
other
transaction,
and
to
see
whether
the
effect
is
the
same.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
the
taxpayer
uses
a...
what
i
might
call
a
double
hypothetical
construct.
they
look--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--yes.
that's
not,
that's
not
the
basis
for
deciding
the
case
in
our
favor,
but
i
should
point
it
out.
they
look
at
a
post-reorganization.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
it's
one
argument.
it
is
not,
i
think,
the
main
argument
that
we
have.
but
just
to
talk
briefly
about
what
the
taxpayer
says;
they
look
at
a
post-reorganization
redemption
of
stock.
that
is
probably
analogous
to
our
looking
at
a
pre
[inaudible]
reorganization
dividend.
it's
a
transaction
that
never
occurred.
there
was
never
a
redemption.
why
i
say
it's
doubly
hypothetical
is
because
the
redemption
that
they
hypothesize
is
the
redemption
of
stock
that
never
existed.
they
posit
a
redemption
of
the
125,000
shares
of
stock
that
clark
declined
to
take
in
the
reorganization,
the
exact
option
that
he
refused
to
take,
and
those
shares
never
existed.
they
were
never
issued
by
the
corporation,
they're
completely
imaginary.
so,
to
that
extent,
i
think
their
claim
is
more
hypothetical
than
ours.
but
i
would
like
to
focus
on
the
statutory
language
which
says,
which
asks
the
question:
does
it
have
the
effect
of
the
distribution
of
a
dividend?
we
think
that
we
have
clearly
shown
that
it
does,
at
least
if
you
look
at
it,
if
you
looked
at
what
would
have
happened
if
basin
has
distributed
the
dividend.
we
think
there's
no
denying
that
it
has
the
effect
of
the
distribution
of
a
dividend.
now,
respondent's
argument
is
that
it
may
also
have
the
effect
of
some
other
transaction
that
they're
able
to
dream
up,
one
that
is
not
a
dividend.
but
that
doesn't
get
around
the
statutory
problems.
statute
says
that
if
it
has
the
effect
of
the
distribution
of
a
dividend,
it's
to
be
treated
as
a
dividend,
and
the
statute
doesn't
care
whether
it
could
have
the
effect
of
some
other
transaction
which
they
hypothesize.
so,
we
think
whether
or
not
you
think
that
the
respondent's
hypothetical
way
of
looking
at
it
is
as
good
as
ours
or
not,
it
does
not
help
them
in
dealing
with
the
statute.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
section
302,
the
question
of
whether
the
parties
think
that
section
302
applies
is
another
one
of
the
red
herrings,
i
think,
that's
been
raised
in
this
case.
there's
no
dispute
on
that
point.
if
there's
a
question
of
needing
to
look
at
the
substantially
disproportionate
criteria
that
are
in
section
302,
because
there
is
a
non
pro
rata
distribution,
the
government
is
willing
to
look
at
it
as
the
taxpayers
are.
i
think
this
is
most
clearly
illustrated,
actually,
if
you
look
at
the
respondent's
brief,
if
you
look
at
the
cases
that
they
cite
for
their
proposition
that
section
302
must
apply.
they're
exactly
the
same
cases
that
the
government
cites
in
its
brief
for
the
proposition
that
a
pro
rata
payment
to
the
shareholders
of
the
acquired
corporation,
a
payment
exactly
the
same
as
what
happened
here,
is
in
fact
a
dividend.
so,
what
they're
doing
is
kind
of
arguing
about
some
side
point
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
what's
really
going
on
in
this
case.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no,
there
are
criteria
in
section
302
for
determining
when
you
have
a
non
pro
rata
distribution,
one
that
results
in
a
reduction
of
interest
by
the
shareholder.
there
are
criteria
in
section
302
for
determining
whether
that
should
have
the
effect
of
a
dividend
of
not.
and
we're
willing
to
look
to
section,
when
you
have
a
problem
like
that,
we're
willing
to
look
to
section
302
for
guidance
just
as
the
respondents
are.
but
here
you
don't
have
that.
you
have
a
100
percent
pro
payment,
pro
rata
payment
to
the
shareholders
of
basin.
under
302,
that's
considered
a
dividend.
that's
what
this
court
said
in
davis.
if
you
don't
look
at
302,
it's
also
a
dividend.
so
it's--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--close
enough
to
pro
rata,
that's
right.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
right,
that's
right.
it's
called
"substantially
disproportionate"
in
the
statute.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes.
their
'84
legislative
history
is
just
a
statement
about
what
the
courts
have
done.
the
commissioner
himself
has
said
that
he's
willing
to
rely
on
section
302
for
guidance.
so,
again,
i
say
that
there's
not
a
real
controversy
over
that
that
impacts
on
this
litigation.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no.
we
don't
think
it
meets
that.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
the
language
you
described,
this
is
describing
something
that
would
not
be
equivalent
to
a
dividend,
justice
rehnquist.
here
we
say
there's
no
change
in
control,
because
it's
a
completely
pro
rata
distribution.
i
think
as
justice
stevens
said,
those
numerical
tests
in
section
302
are
to
decide
when
something
is
close
enough
to
pro
rata
that
it
should
be
treated
as
pro
rata.
if
the
interest
goes
down
below
80
percent,
that's
already
considered
by
the
statute
as
not
a
pro
rata
distribution,
and
therefore
not
a
dividend.
but
here
we
have
a
pro
rata
distribution,
so
it's
not
necessary
to
get
into
that.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
right.
and
if
you
did
look
at
section
302,
you
would
set
the
same
answer,
because
there's
no
reduction
in
interest.
let's
look
at
what
happened
here
with
the
two
transactions,
and
i
think
it
should
be
clear
enough
that
this
has
the
effect
of
a
dividend.
we
start
out
with
basin
having
$2.3
million
in
earnings
and
profits.
that
$2.3
million
was
distributed
on
a
pro
rata
basis
to
the
shareholders
of
basin.
the
only
difference
between
that
and
the
prototype
dividend,
where
the
distribution
was
actually
made
by
basin,
is
that
the
distribution
was
made
by
a
corporation
that's
a
continuation
of
basin
in
a
recast
form.
the
effect
is
certainly
the
same.
at
the
end
of
the
day,
whether
the
dividend
was
paid
directly
by
basin
outside
the
reorganization,
or
paid
in
the
course
of
the
reorganization
as
it
was
here,
$2.3
million
has
disappeared
from
the
corporation
and
ended
up
in
the
pockets
of
clark,
basin's
sole
shareholder.
i'd
like
to
make...
there
are
several
points
we
make
in
our
brief
that
are
critical
of
the
hypothetical
redemption
scenario
that
is
posited
by
the
respondents.
for
one
thing,
it
does
not
have...
it
does
not
fit
the
statutory
language
of
having
the
effect...
the
reorganization
transaction
does
not
have
the
effect
of
the
transaction
that
they
posit,
because
many
of
the
categories
that
are
relevant
for
tax
purposes
would
come
out
quite
differently...
the
amount
of
the
gain,
the
amount
of
the
basis,
the
amount
of
continuing
earnings
and
profits
accounts.
there's
one,
that
stuff
is
in
our
brief.
there's
one
thing
that
i
would
like
to
focus
on
here
in
oral
argument,
though,
and
that
is
the
question
of
the
earnings
and
profits
that
is
required
to
be
compared
by
section
356(a)(2).
the
statute
says
that
the
amount
of
the
boot
that
is
to
be
treated
as
a
dividend
is
limited
by
the
earnings
and
profits
of
the
corporation.
now,
as
i
said
before,
the
corporation
there
has
been
recognized
by
the
courts
and
not
disputed
by
respondent
as
being
the
acquired
corporation.
now,
it's
almost
a
tautology
that
when
you
have
a
dividend,
and
you
compare
the
distribution,
the
dividend
is
a
distribution
out
of
the
earnings
and
profits
of
a
corporation.
the
earnings
and
profits
that
you
look
at
there
are
those
from
the
same
corporation
that's
making
the
distribution
to
its
shareholders.
but
what
you
have
here,
with
the
hypothetical
redemption
scenario
that
the
respondents
have
posited
is
they
assume
that
the
distribution
was
made
by
n.l.,
by
the
later,
combined
corporation,
yet
they
want
to
compare
that
against
the
earnings
and
profits
of
basin,
a
corporation
that
had
no
connection
to
n.l.
at
that
time,
in
determining
whether
that's
a
distribution.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
a
distribution
comes
out
of
the
earnings
and
profits
of
basin
when
you
combine
the
corporations,
and
in
the
merger
those
accounts
are
carried
over
into
the
new
corporation.
so
the
bottom
line
would
be
that
it
would
have
disappeared
from
the
new
corporation,
although
as
it
happens
here,
because
of
the
way
they
structured
it,
the
basin
earnings
and
profits
would
have
gone
into
the
subsidiary,
n.l.a.c.,
that
was
specially
created
by
n.l.
for
the
purposes
of
holding
this
new
corp.
so
it
wouldn't
have
even
gone
into
the
n.l.
earnings
and
profits.
but
that
change
would
be
as
a
consequence
of
it
having
first
come
out
of
basin,
and
then
later
the
accounts
being
transferred
over.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes,
yes,
i
think
if
the
acquiring
corporation
had
a
deficit.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
because
what
is
happening
is
that
the
shareholders
of
the
original
corporation
are
taking
their
earnings
and
profits
out,
and
getting
them
in
their
pocket.
that's
what
they're
ordinarily
part-paid
dividend...
to
treat
as
a
dividend.
the
fact
that
they're
going
into
a
worse
corporation
is
kind
of
irrelevant
to
that.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
then
there's
no
dividend.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
even
so.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
as
boot,
that's
not--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--the
facts
make
it
clear
that
it's
measured
by
the
e
and
p,
and
there's
no...
because
there's
no
suspicion
that
there's
a
bailout
there
of
the
earnings
of
the
acquired
corporation,
because
they
didn't
have
any.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
mr.
slocombe
is
now
taking
the
position
that
the
court
should
basically
ignore
section
356(a)(2).
obviously,
if
the
entire
corporation
had
been
sold
for
all
cash,
it
would
all
be
capital
gain.
however,
it
would
be
more
than
$10
million
of
capital
gain
that
he
would
have
to
recognize
on
the
sale.
respondent
got
a
$7
million
tax
break
by
structuring
this
as
a
reorganization.
$7
million
of
his
gain
is
not
recognized.
that's
because
it
was
a
reorganization.
that's
because
the
assumption
is
that
there
is
a
continuing
enterprise
going
on
here,
not
getting
rid
of
his
old
enterprise
and
turning
it
into
cash,
and
the
corollary
to
that
is
what
congress
recognized
in
356(a)(2),
which
is
if
you've
got
a
continuing
enterprise,
you've
still
got
these
earnings
and
profits
sitting
around
in
the
corporation,
and
if
you
take
them
out,
you're
going
to
have
to
consider
whether
what
you've
done
has
the
effect
of
a
dividend.
and
that's
what's
happened
here.
as
mr.
slocombe
himself
said,
the
idea
of
mr.
clark's
notion
was
to
get
his
money
out,
or
some
of
his
money
out.
what
does
that
mean,
his
money?
it's
the
money
that
he
earned
when
basin
was
operating
as
a
corporation,
and
it's
been
sitting
in
basin,
and
earning
some
profits.
that's
the
money
that
he's
got.
and
this
question
of
whether
he
bailed
it
out
or
not
is
not
a
factual
issue,
it's
just
an
objective
characterization
of
what's
gone
on
by
having
the
money
come
out.
one
more
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
is
this
notion
of
whether
the
government
is
bifurcating
the
transaction,
or
just
looking
at
it
in
isolation,
while
respondents
arguably
isn't.
obviously
they're
looking
at
it
in
isolation
also,
by
focusing
on
this
change
of
interest,
this
hypothetical
change
of
interest,
as
justice
stevens
says,
if
he
had
taken
more
stock
or
less
stock.
what
happened
here
is
that
he
went
from
a
100
percent
owner
of
a
corporation
down
to
a
1.3
percent,
i
guess
it
is,
owner
of
another
corporation.
now,
if
you
look
at
the
whole
transaction,
obviously
it
can't
make
any
serious
difference
whether
he
went
from
100
percent
to
1.3,
from
100
percent
to
0.9,
or
100
percent
to
1.15.
none
of
that
matters.
so,
if
you
look
at
the
whole
thing,
there's
just
this
change
of
interest
basically
fails
out.
and
if
you
try
to
apply
the
redemption
provisions
as
they
try
to
do,
that
difference
becomes
clear,
because
the
reason
why
the
service,
in
these
rulings
that
have
been
cited
by
respondent
does
not
require
dividend
treatment
for
a
small
change
in
interest
by
a
minority
shareholder,
is
because
a
minority
shareholder...
that
kind
of
distribution
to
a
minority
shareholder
is
not
regarded
as
a
dividend,
because
a
minority
shareholder
doesn't
have
the
power
to
declare
a
dividend
to
himself.
but
here,
clark
wants
to
treat
himself
as
a
minority
shareholder
by
looking
at
the
transaction
from
a
post-hope
way.
but
of
course
he
isn't,
really.
he
started
as
a
100
percent
shareholder
who
could
have
declared
those
earnings
and
profits
out
to
himself
from
basin
at
any
time,
and
that's
essentially
what's
happened.
i
think
all
of
what
the
respondent
says
about
change
in
interest,
etcetera,
etcetera
would
all
apply
equally
if
in
fact
basin
had
distributed
this
as
a
dividend
before
the
reorganization...
say,
the
day
before.
his
interest
in
the
continuing
corporation
would
have
ended
up
being
less.
it
would
all
come
out
to
be
the
same.
yet,
it
would
still
have
clearly
been
a
dividend
in
the
316.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
if
you
do
it
only
two
weeks
later...
i
mean,
there's
a
question,
when
you
have--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
he
didn't
do
it
that
way.
i
would
just
point
out...
i
don't
want
to
get
into
an
argument,
but
it
would
have
been
a
different
transaction
if
you
look
at
3739
of
our
brief.
