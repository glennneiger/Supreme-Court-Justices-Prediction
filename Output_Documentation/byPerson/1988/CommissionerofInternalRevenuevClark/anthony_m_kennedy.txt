justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
counsel,
you're
asking
us
to
rule
for
you
on
the
assumption
that
the
redemption
was
prior
to
and
apart
from
the
merger,
are
you
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
isn't
that
the
way
you
want
us
to
look
at
the
transaction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
either
case,
that's
a
hypothetical
construct,
compared
to
what
really
happened?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
the
taxpayer
uses
a
hypothetical
construct
as
well?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you're
saying
his
is
more
hypothetical
than
yours?
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
might
it
be
a
basis
for
deciding
the
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
say
that
302
is
irrelevant
in
any
case,
where
we
are
construing
this
statute
that
is
before
us,
or
just
in
this
one?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
you
answered
justice
stevens
that
you
would
subtract
this
distribution
from
the
balance
sheet
of
n.l.--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
the
other
way
around...
the
acquired
corporation
has
no
accumulated
earnings
and
profits?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
the
acquiring
corporation
does,
and
it
pays
the
stockholder
cash.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
just
so
that
i
understand,
he
could
always
show
the
effect
on
the
corporation
just
by
comparing
the
percentage
of
stock
in
justice
stevens'
hypothetical,
where
he's
not
given
a
choice.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
by
that,
then,
that
you
are
comparing
his
position
in
the
acquired
corporation
with
his
position
in
the
acquiring
corporation,
and
i...
which
was
i
guess
what
the
district
court
did
in
shimberg,
and
everybody
seems
to
agree
that
that's
wrong.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
isn't
that
what
you
just
said?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
some
of
my
money
out
of
what?
