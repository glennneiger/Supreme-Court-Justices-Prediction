chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
87-1168,
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
v.
donald
e.
clark.
mr.
horowitz,
you
may
begin
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
would
you
vary
the
facts
in
this
case
so
that
the
government
would
concede
there
was
not
a
pro
rata
distribution?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
fourth
circuit
relied
rather
heavily
on
section
302.
does
the
government
think
that
has
no
applicability?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
say
that
the
reorganization
in
this
test
meets
the
language
of
section
302
that
the
shareholder
relinquishes
more
than
20
percent
of
his
corporate
control
and
less
than
50
percent
shell
at
the
transaction?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
said.
but
you
said
that's
not
the
only
way
you
can
conclude
that
something
is
essentially
equivalent
to
a
dividend?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
when
something
is
concededly
pro
rata,
you
don't
get
the
section
302?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
horowitz.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
slocombe.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
yes.
you
don't
ordinarily
have
a
situation
where
one
shareholder
gets
a
check
like
that,
and
the
others
don't.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
precisely
did
the
tax
court
find--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
the
case
have
come
out
differently
if
instead
he
said:
i
want
to
buy
a
caribbean
island?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
the
case
have
come
out
differently
in
your
view
if
he
had
said:
not
that
i
don't
want
to
be
involved
to
that
extent
with
n.l.
but
that
i
have
a
pressing
need
for
cash
right
now?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
it
does
seem
that...
what
is
the
relevancy
of
the
inquiry?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
he
takes
all
stock,
it's
not
taxable
at
all?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
at
that
point,
it's
not
taxable,
and
if
he
takes
all
money,
it's
taxable
only
at
capital
gains
rates?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it's
only...
the
government
says
only
in
this
situation
where
it's
some
stock
and
some
boot
that
you
have
to
pay
ordinary
income.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
slocombe.
mr.
horowitz,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
horowitz.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
