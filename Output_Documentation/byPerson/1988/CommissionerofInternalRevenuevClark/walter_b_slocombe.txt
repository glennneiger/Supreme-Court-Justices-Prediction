mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
central
fact
in
this
case
is
that
there
is
no
dispute
that
if
mr.
clark
had
not
taken
the
cash,
he
would
have
received
an
additional
125,000
shares
of
n.l.
stock.
so,
the
effect
of
the
exchange
in
which
he
got
the
cash
was
that
he
got
about
30
percent
less
n.l.
stock
than
he
would
otherwise
have
received.
the
question
here
is
whether
the
fourth
circuit
was
right
in
affirming.
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
no,
it
doesn't
depend
on
there
having
been
an
option.
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
but
the
existence
of
the
option
makes
clear
what
was
really
going
on.
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
our
view
is
that
in
another
case
where
a
shareholder
of
a
small
corporation...
that
corporation
was
being
absorbed
by
a
big
corporation...
they
would
normally
be
able
to
show
that
if
they
hadn't
gotten
the
cash,
they
would
have
gotten
more
stock.
but
the
burden
would
be
on
them.
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
it
would
be,
in
other
cases--
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
--it
would
be
a
factual
problem
that
doesn't
exist
here.
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
in
other
cases,
there
would
be
a
factual
problem
that
doesn't
exist
here.
but
in
this
case,
the
effect
of
receiving
the
cash
is
clear.
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
because
there
will
be
a
problem
of
showing
the
effect.
the
statute
makes
the
test
the
effect
of
the
exchange,
not
the
effect
just
of
the
cash,
but
the
effect
of
the
exchange,
and
therefore,
the
inquiry
has
to
be
what
difference
in
the
world
did
receiving
the
cash
in
this
exchange
make?
and
here,
the
answer
is
clear.
in
other...
it's
not
an
unusual
situation
of
which
there
are
alternatives.
and
in
other
cases,
the
taxpayer
would
have
a
different
burden,
a
different...
they
always
have
the
burden
of
proof;
he'd
have
a
different
problem
showing
the
factual
situation,
showing
the
effect.
but
that's
the
inquiry
that
the
statute
makes
critical...
what's
the
effect
of
the
exchange.
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
if
the
taxpayer
couldn't
show
that
the
effect
of
the
exchange
was
to
reduce
his
ownership
in
the
continuing
corporation,
then
we
would
have
a
different
case,
yes.
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
yes.
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
i
believe
in
the
normal
case
it
would
be
the
fact,
and
you'd
be
able
to
show
it,
that
if
the
taxpayer,
the
shareholder
hadn't
received
the
cash,
he
would
have
insisted
on
more
stock,
yes.
but
he'd
have
to
show
that,
but
that's
what
he'd
have
to
show.
he'd
have
to
show
that
there
was
an
effect
on
his
continuing
ownership
in
the
corporation.
here
we've
met
that
burden,
and
shown
what
the
effect
was.
but
the
task,
the
issue,
the
factual
situation
isn't
any
different,
but
what
the
taxpayer
would
have
to
show
is
to
show
what
we
showed
here
in
the
tax
court,
and
in
this
trial.
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
if
he's
not
given
a
choice,
he's
got
a
harder
problem,
because
he'd
have
to
show
what
would
have
happened
if
he
hadn't
taken
the
choice.
but
the
whole
concept
of
a
reorganization
is
that
there's
a
continuing
enterprise.
there's
no
excuse
that
if
he'd
sold
it
all
for
cash,
that
would
have
been
a
capital
gain.
there's
no
dispute
that
if
he'd
taken
all
stock
and
at
some
appropriate
point
in
the
future,
so
that
it
didn't
destroy
the
reorganization,
had
sold
30
percent
of
it,
that
would
have
been
a
capital
gain.
the
issue
is,
what
is
the
effect
of
getting
the
cash
at
the
time
of
the
reorganization
as
a
part
of
the
overall
exchange
to
give
him
a
dividend?
and
in
this
case,
it
is
clear
what
i
think
would
also
be
the
fact
in
most
similar
cases.
we
have
a
large
corporation
merging,
absorbing
a
smaller
corporation.
the
people
who
get,
the
people
who
own
the
smaller
corporation,
would
insist
on
more
stock
if
they
couldn't
get
cash.
but
the
point
is
that
the
effect
of
taking
the
cash
out
is
to
reduce,
clearly
here,
to
reduce
the
amount
of
ownership
he
has
in
the
continuing
enterprise,
and
this
court
has
defined
dividend
not
in
terms
of
what's
pro
rata
or
not,
but
in
terms
of
the
impact
of
the
distribution
on
ownership.
in
davis,
this
court
said
that
a
dividend
results
when
a
distribution
produces
no
change
in
the
relative
economic
interests
or
rights
of
the
shareholders
whereas
conversely,
there
is
no
dividend
if
a
distribution
results
in
a
meaningful
reduction
in
the
proportionate
interest
of
the
shareholder
in
the
corporation.
but
where
there's
a
reorganization,
our
position
is,
and
what
the
fourth
circuit
held,
was
that
the
corporation
there
means
the
only
corporation
that's
going
to
continue
to
exist.
basin
went
out
of
existence
at
the
moment
of
the
reorganization.
insofar
as
the
irs
test
focuses
on
ownership
at
all,
it
focuses
on
ownership
in
basin.
but
basin
didn't
exist
anymore.
there
is
a
continuing...
but
there
was
a
continuing
ownership.
clark's
continuing
ownership
was
reduced
as
a
result
of
receiving
the
cash.
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
he
never
got
425,000
shares.
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
because
we
have
here
a
clear
indication,
as
your
question
earlier--
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
--he
know
how
much
he
would
have
gotten.
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
because
to
ask
about
the
effect
of
an
exchange
necessarily
involves
asking
what
difference
does
it
make
that
this
event
took
place
rather
than
some
other
event?
our
view
is
that
section
356(a)(2)
really
is
concerned
with
situations
as
is
302
in
which
the
money
comes
out
and
there
is
no
change
in
the
continuing
ownership
interest.
302
is
relevant
here
not
just
because
of
the
numerical
calculations
of
what
is
substantial,
once
you
decide
that
there's
been
some
reduction.
how
much
reduction
is
enough?
it's
also
relevant
because
both
sections
are
trying
to
deal
with
the
same
basic
question:
when
has
getting
money
from
a
corporation
sufficiently
reduced
the
shareholder's
interest
in
the
continuing
business
that
it
has
the
effect
of
going
out
and
selling
some
of
that
stock,
so
that
it
should
be
treated
as
a
capital
gain?
now,
302
is
relevant
to
356
for
determining
the
character.
the
particular
rules
for
the
amount,
how
the
basis
is
calculated
and
that
sort
of
thing
are
determined
in
detail
in
section
356
separately
from
the
characterization
issue.
now,
the
irs
has
in
fact
changed
its
position;
not
with
respect
to
this
exact
particular
case,
but
it
is
following
a
position
in
very
similar
other
cases
which
is
not
the
same
as
what
it's
following
here.
even
in
this
case,
it's
said
in
a
ruling
that
302
applies,
but
as
to
very
similar
cases.
for
example,
there's
a
revenue
ruling,
75-447,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
in
which
there
is
a
pro
rata
distribution
of
cash
by
a
corporation
to
two
shareholders,
each
of
whom
owns
50
percent,
and
then
the
corporation
sells
additional
stock
to
a
third
person,
so
that
they
end
up
instead
of
each
owning
half,
they
now
only
each
own
a
third.
service
has
held
that
ought
to
be
held
as
an
integrated
whole.
you
ought
to
look
at
the
continuing
ownership
interest
in
that
situation,
and
they
said
the
reason
for
that
is
that
a
correct
analysis
requires
that
effect
be
given
only
to
the
overall
result
and
proscribed
to
the
fragmenting
of
the
whole
transaction
into
its
component
parts.
and
they
go
on
to
explain
that
the
approach
is
needed
because
making
the
computations
in
this
manner
properly
reflects
the
extent
to
which
the
shareholder
involved
in
each
situation
actually
reduces
his
stock
holding
as
a
result
of
the
whole
transaction.
in
the
real,
practical
world,
what
happened
here
was
mr.
clark
chose
in
effect
to
trade
70
percent
of
his
basin
stock
for
n.l.
stock
and
30
percent
for
cash.
because
it
was
in
the
context
of
a
reorganization,
special
separate
rules
for
computing
the
gain,
it
was
recognized.
but
that's
what
really
happened.
and
there's
nothing
surprising
that
in
a
system
as...
that
was
in
existence
at
that
time,
it
doesn't
exist
anymore.
but
in
a
system
where
there
was
a
differential
between
capital
gains
and
ordinary
income,
you
would
expect
that
when
there
is
a
substantial
diminution
of
ownership
interest,
then
capital
gains
is
the
appropriate
treatment.
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
everybody
seems
to
agree
that
it's
wrong.
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
no.
what
i
just
said
was
that
he
had
a
relative
ownership
in
the
combination
of
basin
and
n.l.
before
the
transaction.
the
whole
idea
of
a
reorganization
is
that
not
just
n.l.
goes
on
after
the
reorganization,
but
basin
goes
on
inside
n.l.,
as
a
different
entity.
both
as
to
n.l.
and
as
to
basin,
it
emerges
from
the
transaction.
his
relative
ownership
was
425,000
shares'
worth
of
n.l.
before
the
transaction.
the
market
shows
that.
after
the
transaction,
his
relative
ownership
was
300,000
shares'
worth.
it
is
true
in
practice
that
it
will
normally
be
the
case
if
the
taxpayer
can
bear
the
burden
of
proof
and
show
the
relevant
facts
the...
in
any
situation
where,
so
to
speak,
the
whale
swallows
a
minnow,
then
capital
gain
treatment
for
the
boot
will
be
appropriate.
but
it's
because
of
the
effect
on
the
continuing
ownership,
not
simply
because
he's
going
from
100
percent
down
to,
i'm
sorry,
from
100
percent
down
to
1.3
percent,
or
0.9
percent,
which
he
would
in
either
event.
we're
not
arguing
that
it's
an
automatic
rule.
i
think,
rather,
if
the...
we're
arguing
the
importance
of
effect
on
ownership.
and
indeed,
the
irs
test
also
relies
on
effect
on
ownership.
they
said:
we
don't
want
an
automatic
dividend
rule.
that's
what
people
said,
dedford
said,
and
all
the
commentators,
all
right-thinking
people,
said
an
automatic
dividend
rule
is
wrong.
we
don't
want
that.
we
only
want
it
in
pro
rata
cases.
the
difficult
with
that
argument
is
that
knowing
that
the
distribution
from
a
corporation
is
not
pro
rata
doesn't
tell
you
whether
it's
a
dividend
or
not.
if
only
one
of
three
shareholders
of
a
corporation
gets
something
from
the
corporation...
gets
a
check
from
the
corporation
in
respect
to
his
or
her
stock,
and
there's
no
effect
on
ownership,
that's
still
a
dividend.
that's
not
entitled
to
capital
gains
transaction.
other
shareholders
may
have
a
quarrel
with
it.
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
the
service
will
certainly
take
the
position
that
where
money
is
coming
out
to
a
dominant
shareholder,
maybe
money
that
was
claimed
to
be
salary
and
is
held
to
be
unreasonable,
they'll
say
that's
a
dividend.
it's
taxable
to
him
as
a
dividend,
even
though
the
other
shareholders
didn't
get
an
equal...
didn't
get
a
proportionate
amount.
it's
unusual,
but
there's
no
question
if
that's
all
that
happens
that
the
dividend...
now
in
their
reply
brief,
the
irs
sets
up
a
hypothetical
where
one
person
has
70
percent
and
the
other
has
30
percent.
and
mr.
70
percent
gets
all
stock
and
mr.
30
percent
gets
all
cash,
and
they
say
that
shows
we're
not
in
favor
of
an
automatic
dividend
rule.
that
shows
what
we
mean
by
disproportionate
distribution.
but
in
their
reply
brief,
they
explain
why
it
is
that
mr.
30
percent
is
treated
as
getting
a
capital
gain
there,
and
it
is
because
the
effect
is
to
terminate
his
interest
in
the
continuing
corporation.
they
concede
that
even
with
the
disproportionate
distribution,
you
have
to
look
to
what
was
the
impact
of
getting
the
cash
on
his
interest
in
the
continuing
corporation.
disproportionate
test,
therefore,
is
simply
a
way
of
highlighting
the
effect
on
continuing
interest.
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
a
very
important
class
of
cases
where
it
wouldn't
be
the
case.
first
of
all,
there
are
classes
of
reorganization
where
only
one
corporation
is
involved.
there
are
reorganizations
where
there
are
overlapping
ownership,
and
there
are
reorganizations
where
two
relatively
equal
companies
are
merged.
and
in
all
of
those
cases
you
can
have
a
situation
where
the
reduction
will
exist,
but
it
will
not
be
sufficient
to
produce...
there
may
not
be
any
reduction
at
all.
but
even
where
a
reduction
exists,
it
may
not
be
enough
to
be
meaningful.
when
the
service
has
held,
this
is
not
the
result
of
this
case,
but
of
lots
of
rulings
in
the
past,
the
service
has
held
that
a
minority
shareholder
going
down
by
as
little
as
a
few
percent,
three
or
four
percent,
that's
meaningful
for
a
minority
shareholder.
but
for
a
majority
shareholder
who
continues
to
be
able
to
control
the
corporation,
he
can
go
down
quite
a
bit,
as
long
as
he
doesn't
go
below
a
control
level,
and
that
reduction
is
not
meaningful
and
that
would
be
treated
as
a
dividend.
so
356(a)(2)
would
continue
to
be
a
meaningful
provision
of
the
code
if
the
fourth
circuit
opinion
were
affirmed
here.
it
doesn't
make
it
a
dead
letter.
it
makes
it
not
apply
in
situations
where
the
effect
is
not
that
of
a
dividend
but
that's
what
it
says.
it
doesn't
mean
there
are
no
cases
in
which
it
would
apply.
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
yes.
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
it
would
not
apply,
subject
always
to
the
requirement
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
taxpayer,
and
he
has
to
show
what
the
effect
of
the
exchange
is.
i
agree
in
the
normal
situation
he
would
be
able
to
show
it.
moreover,
the
problem...
at
some
point
in
their
brief,
the
irs
suggests
that
they
have
an
intuition,
they
use
the
word
intuition,
about
what's
going
on
here.
the
taxpayer
was
trying
to
bail
out,
bail
out
earnings.
the
tax
court
as
the
trier
of
facts
specifically
found
that
there
was
not
the
slightest
evidence
of
that.
this
is
not
a
situation
where
something
different
is
going
on,
and
it
would
be
open
to
the
government
to
prove
something
quite
different
was
going
on.
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
with
respect
to
that?
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
that
there
was
not
the
slightest
evidence
that
mr.
clark
was
using
this
as
an
opportunity
to
bail
out
accumulated
earnings.
and
i
raise
the
point
because
the
suggestion
is
made
that
that
what
was
really
going
on.
that's
a
factual
assertion...
the
tax
court
specifically
found
contrary
to
that
factual
assertion.
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
justice
scalia,
he
said
more
than
just
i
want
cash.
he
said:
i
want
cash
because
i
don't
want
to
own
so
much
n.l.
stock.
i
don't
want
to
be
that
tied
to
n.l.
i
want,
in
effect,
to
get
some
of
my
money
out
in
return
for
less
n.l.
stock.
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
so
that's
a
meaningful
inquiry,
yes.
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
out
of
the
continuing
business.
he
knew
he
was
going
to
have
because
it
qualified
as
a
reorganization,
he
knew
he
was
going
to
have
an
interest
in
n.l.
otherwise
the
whole
thing
would
have
been
taxable,
and
it
would
all
have
been
taxable
as
a
capital
gain.
he
said:
i
want
not
to
hold
so
much
n.l.
stock
and
the
tax
court
found
that
that
was
what
was
going
on.
another
aspect
of
the
problem
which
is
relevant--
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
--no.
what
he
wants
to
do
with
the
money
is
not
relevant.
why
he
wants
not
to
own
the
n.l.
stock,
i
believe,
is
relevant,
and
the
tax
court
thought
it
was
relevant.
money
is
money.
that's
one
of
the
problems
with
the
system
that
taxes
capital
gains
and
ordinary
income
at
different
rates.
you're
always
trying
to
decide
what
the
character
of
that
income
would
be,
and
it's
all
money.
the
issue
is
not
what
he
wanted
to
spend
the
money
on,
but
why
he
chose
not
to
take
so
much
n.l.
stock.
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
no.
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
the
relevancy
of
the
inquiry
is
that
the
charge
is
made
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
and
the
charge
is
specifically
refuted
in
the
record.
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
no.
every
corporation's
value
is
in
the
sense
only
the
value
of
its
past
accumulated
earnings--
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
--it
isn't
crucial.
but
it
underscores
what
was
really
happening
here,
as
opposed...
the
government
accuses
us
of
wanting
to
do
this
and
analyze
this
case
on
a
hypothetical
basis.
it's
not
hypothetical
what
was
actually
going
on
here,
and
the
record
makes
clear
what
was
actually
going
on.
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
yes,
and
that's
because
whenever
you
ask
about
effects,
you're
asking
about
something
which
didn't
happen.
the
only
way
you
could
meaningfully
answer
the
question
about
effect
is
effect
compared
to
what?
the
government
says
take
the...
if
he'd
taken
the
money
straight
out
of
the
corporation,
and
that's
all
we
will
ask
about...
that
will
always
be
a
dividend,
no
matter
whether
it's
pro
rata
or
disproportionate,
that
will
always
be
a
dividend
unless
you
show
that
something
else
was
going
on.
the
something
else
here
that
was
going
on
was
the
reduction
in
his
continuing
ownership
in
the
corporation.
the
practical
effect
of
the
decision,
overturning
the
fourth
circuit,
would
be
to
create
a
good
deal
of
confusion
in
the
area.
the
irs
is
not
clear
in
this
situation
about
when
or
how
much
of
the
302
analysis
applies.
they
don't
say
how
much
disproportion
is
enough.
surely
if
there
had
been
a
one
percent
shareholder
who
had
gotten
all
the
stuff,
i
assume
that
the
commissioner
would
take
the
same
position,
that
mr.
clark's
99
percent
was
divided,
still
divided
70-30.
that
was
still
a
dividend.
as
the
fourth
circuit
points
out
in
their
opinion,
there
are
circumstances
in
which
this
approach,
the
irs
approach,
would
be
subject
to
manipulation,
because
it
makes
in
an
overlapping
ownership
situation,
because
it
makes
a
great
deal
turn
on
which
corporation
survives
the
reorganization.
indeed,
the
irs
recognized
this
at
trial,
and
in
their
trial
brief
they
said
they
didn't
want
to
win
too
much.
they
wanted
to
make
sure
they
limited
the
effect
of
their
victory
to
cases
just
exactly
like
this
one.
that
suggests
to
me
that
there's
something
wrong
with
the
test
they're
proposing.
it
doesn't
work
in
the
generality
of
cases
to
go
with
the
evil
which
congress
said
in
the
1924
legislative
history
was
what
they
were
going
at
which
was
situations
in
which
there
was
an
evasion
of
the
principle
of
taxing
dividends
because
a
reorganization,
the
form
of
a
reorganization,
was
gone
through.
there
was
no
substantial
change
in
who
controlled
the
corporation,
and
yet
money
had
come
out.
that,
we
submit,
and
that's
what
the
fourth
circuit
found,
and
the
tax
court
found,
that
section
356(a)(2)
is
about,
and
that
is
what
the
statute
ought
to
be
limited
to
ruling
as
a
dividend.
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
generally
speaking,
that
would
be
a
capital
gain.
that
would
be
a
complete
liquidation
of
the
corporation.
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
just
as
if
he
sold
it
all
for
cash.
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
to
take
less
stock,
and
to
take
cash,
yes.
because
that
is
exactly
what
he
did,
and
in
effect,
he
was
selling
30
percent
for
cash,
and
he
was
taxed
on
that.
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
if
he
had
taken
all
cash,
there's
no
question
that
it
would
all
have
been
capital
gain.
it
would
all
have
been
realized
at
the
time
of
the
event,
in
1979.
as
mr.
horowitz
says,
the
code
sets
up
an
exception
for
certain
circumstances
in
which
there
is
a
reorganization.
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
right.
obviously
i
don't
accept
the
characterization
take
out
some
of
the
earnings.
if
he
wants
to--
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
--if
he
wants
to
dispose
of
a
part
of
his
interest
for
cash,
while
otherwise
the
requirements
of
reorganization
are
met,
yes.
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
yes,
because
remember
the
effect
of
selling
out
altogether
for
cash
would
be
that
he
no
longer
has
any
continuing
interest.
in
a
sense,
the
system
matches,
matches
the
appropriate
level
of
taxation
to
what's
happening.
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
no.
yes,
it
is
not
taxable.
it's
all
deferred.
it
will
be
taxed
eventually.
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
yes.
mr.
walter
b.
slocombe
yes.
mr.
horowitz
in
rebuttal
will
undoubtedly
say
that
if
he
he
had
sold
it
all,
the
computations
would
be
different.
section
356
provides
special
rules
for
how
you
compute
the
amount
of
gain
when
there's
boot,
and
they're
somewhat
different
from
the
regular
rules,
and
they're
less
favorable
to
taxpayers,
because
you
don't
get
credit
for
any
of
the
bases.
but
the
basic
proposition
is
yes,
that
you...
the
disposition
of
your
interest
in
a
corporation,
of
your
property
interest,
is
generally
taxed
as
capital
transaction.
the
point
that
we
are
making
here
is
that
this
was
in
effect
not
a
pulling
of
earnings
out
of
a
continuing
corporation
without
affecting
interest,
but
a
trading
of
a
reduced
ownership
interest
in
the
continuing
corporation
for
cash
at
the
time
of
the
reorganization.
thank
you.
