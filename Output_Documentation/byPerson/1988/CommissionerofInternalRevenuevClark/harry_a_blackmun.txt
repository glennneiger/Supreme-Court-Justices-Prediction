worked
into
the
decisional
process
at
all?
justice

i
missed
what
you
said
there,
mr.
horowitz.
what
happened
in
the
tax
court?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--it
was
a
review
decision?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
it
was
unanimous,
was
it
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--the
court
of

justice

a
unanimous
array
of
judges
against
you
