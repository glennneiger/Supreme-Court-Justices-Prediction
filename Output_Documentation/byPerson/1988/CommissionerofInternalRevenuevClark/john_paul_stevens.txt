mr.
horowitz,
isn't
it
possible
to
view
the
issue
in
this
case
as
whether
or
not
there
was
a
pro
rata
distribution
depending
on
whether
you
look
at
it
before
or
after
the
acquisition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
wasn't
distributed
by
the
acquired
corporation
to
its
shareholders,
it
was
distributed
by
the
acquiring
corporation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
wouldn't
you
also
concede
there
was
no
pro
rata
distribution
if
they,
in
an
all
stock
transaction
with
a
contractual
provision
that
30
days
later,
some
of
the
stock
would
be
redeemed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
think
the
government
might
argue
it
was
boot,
because
it
was
contemplated
from
the
outset
that
the
selling
shareholder
would
end
up
with
the
same
number
of
dollars
that
he
did
here,
only
he
just
had
to
wait
15
days.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one
other
question?
what
happened
to
the
balance
sheet
of
the
merged
corporation
when
this
money
is
treated
as
a
dividend?
does
the
earned
surplus
account
subtract
this
amount
from
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
restate
what
i
think
you're...
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
it.
you're
saying
that
302
is
relevant,
but
only
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
distribution
is
pro
rata
or
not,
in
effect?
it's
close
enough
to
being
pro
rata
to
be
treated
as
a
dividend?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that's
your
answer
to
their
reliance
on
the
84
legislative
history?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
it,
i
know
it's
not
apt
to
happen
with
the
corporations
of
the
relative
size
of
these
two,
but
suppose
the
acquiring
corporation
had
a
deficit
that
was
as
great
as
or
greater
than
the
earned
surplus
of
the
acquired
corporation.
would
there
be...
would
that
have
the
effect
of
a
dividend
then?
do
you
understand
my--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--had
a
deficit,
so
that
after
the
transaction,
this
would
have
just
in
effect
doubled
the
deficit,
you'd
say,
i
suppose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
was
it
that
it
was
still
treated
as
a
dividend?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
slocombe,
let
me
interrupt
right
there.
if
that's
the
central
fact,
would
your
position
be
different
if
the
acquiring
corporation
had
not
given
him
an
option,
but
had
simply
said:
this
is
our
proposal:
x
shares
of
stock
and
x
cash?
does
your
case
depend
on
there
having
been
an
option,
or--
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
just
helps
with
the
arithmetic.
i
don't
see
it
helps
with
the
legal
analysis
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
couldn't
show
it
if
the
buyer
didn't
offer
it.
they
said:
the
amount
of
shares
we'll
issue
is
this
ceiling,
and
that's
it.
the
rest
is
going
to
be
cash.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
know
why
that's
a
different
case.
that's
what
i'm...
that's...
if
you
say
this
is
a
central
fact,
you'd
better
explain
it
to
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
say
the
effect
might
be
different
if
he
didn't
have
an
option?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
just
as
much
a
hypothetical...
an
interest
he
never
got
was
reduced.
but
it
seems
to
me
this
is
a
standoff
on
your
two
hypotheticals,
because
he
never
got
the
425,000
shares.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
he
accepted
that
offer
and
changed
his
mind
and--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--sure,
it
helps
on
the
arithmetic,
but
he
never
got
it,
so
how
can
you
say
it's
been
reduced?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
you
are
saying
that
if
the
record
showed
that
a
couple
of
years
ago,
he'd
said,
i've
got
this
$2
million
of
accumulated
earnings
in
this
corporation
that
i
own.
i
want
to
get
it
out
without
paying
a
dividend.
how
can
we
structure
a
transaction
to
accomplish
this
result?
and
they
went
ahead
and
structured
this
transaction,
you'd
lose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
win
on
the
facts
that
i've
given
you,
then
this
testimony...
it
doesn't
really
add
or
subtract
anything?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
hypothetical
when
you
say
you
reduced
your
ownership
because
you
didn't
take
some
stuff
you
never
got.
i
mean,
they're
both
hypothetical.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you
keep
giving
the
example
that
if
they
had
done
it
a
little
different...
if
you
had
also
solo
30
percent
of
the
stock
for
cash,
and
then
two
weeks
later
entered
into
a
statutory
reorganization,
you
would
get
capital
gain.
you
don't
have
to
change
the
facts
very
much
to
make
the
answer
very
easy.
the
problem
is--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
whatever
the
period
would
be
to
get
you,
get
the
irs
off
your
back.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
first
case
commission
of
internal
revenue
against
clark.
the
case
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
it
requires
that
we
construe
section
356(a)(2)
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
the
code
provides
that
certain
tax-free
stock-for-stock
exchanges
can
be
made.
however,
if
such
an
exchange
is
accompanied
by
a
cash
payment,
something
the
tax
practitioners
refer
to
as
boot,
gain
is
recognized
up
to
the
value
of
the
boot
and
the
question
is
whether
the
gain
should
be
treated
as
capital
gain
or
ordinary
income.
in
this
case,
it
is
treated
as
ordinary
income
if
it
has
the
effect
of
the
distribution
of
a
dividend.
in
the
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
agree
with
the
fourth
circuit
that
the
determination
of
whether
an
exchange
has
the
effect
of
a
dividend
should
be
made
by
treating
the
payment
of
boot
as
though
it
came
from
the
acquiring
corporation
in
the
context
of
a
redemption
immediately
following
the
corporate
reorganization.
applying
this
test,
we
conclude
that
the
cash
payment
received
by
the
tax
payer
in
this
case
is
not
appropriately
characterized
as
a
dividend
and
that
he
correctly
applied
a
capital
gains
rate
and
that
the
tax
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
properly
sustained
his
position.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
accordingly
affirmed.
justice
scalia
joins
all
the
part
three
of
the
court's
opinion,
and
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
