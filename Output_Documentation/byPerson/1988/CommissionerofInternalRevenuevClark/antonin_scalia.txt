mr.
horowitz,
do
i
understand
you
to
be
saying
that
if
clark
had
a
partner
in
basin,
and
they
both
sold
out,
and
clark's
partner
took
it
all
in
n.l.
stock,
but
clark
took
it
just
the
way
he
did
here,
clark
would...
neither
of
the
two
would
be
receiving
a
dividend?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
make
a
whole
lot
of
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
always
is
that.
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
just
balking
at
two
unreal
hypotheticals
instead
of
one.
i
mean,
the
fact
is
that
he
didn't
accept
the
offer--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
you're
willing
to
leap
over
that
fact.
but
you
could
also
say
in
a
case
where
no
offer
has
been
made,
the
same
thing.
not
only
didn't
he
accept
the
offer,
but
also
the
offer
wasn't
made.
but
you
could
likewise
say,
nonetheless,
had
there
been
an
offer,
and
had
the
offer
been
accepted,
he
would
simply
be
reducing
the
amount
of
his
stock
in
the
new
corporation,
in
the
acquiring
corporation.
isn't
that
true
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
how
can
you
say
he
reduced
that
ownership?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me...
but
taking
boot
is
always
going
to
reduce
your
interest
in
the...
in
the
acquiring
corporation.
that
will
always
be
the
effect,
won't
it?
so
wouldn't
this
whole
provision
be
a
dead
letter,
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
acknowledge
that
it
would...
it
would
not
apply
where
a
small
corporation...
the
minnow
and
the
whale.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
not
apply
in
those
cases?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
the
man
wanted
cash.
do
you
think
anybody
says:
gee,
i
want
that
portion
of
cash
that's
return
of
capital
or
i
want
that
portion
of
cash
that's
growth
and
therefore
dividends.
is
that
at
all...
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
make
any
sense
to
even
ask
that
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
slocombe,
suppose
your
client
had
just
dissolved
the
corporation,
said:
you
know,
i
want
out
of
this
business,
and
i'm
not
going
to
do
any
more
business
in
the
future.
fold
it
all
up.
he
just
terminates
it,
and
takes
all
the
money
out,
doesn't
sell
it
to
anybody.
what
would
happen
to
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
all
the
accumulated
earnings
as
well
as--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
you're
saying
that
essentially
it
ought
to
be
the
same
kind
of
treatment
when
instead
of
just
dissolving
it,
he
sells
it
away,
and
decides
that
instead
of
taking
some
stock
in
the
new
corporation,
or
in
the
acquiring
corporation,
to
take
cash.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
he
had
taken
all
cash?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
he
could,
in
effect,
take
out
all
the
earnings
by
selling
the
whole
thing
and
get
capital
gains
treatment
on
the
whole
thing,
but
if
he
just
tries
to
take
out
some
of
the
earnings,
by
getting
just
some
cash
to
boot,
you're
saying
the
government
wants
to,
wants
to
treat
that
as
dividends.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
sort
of
have
a
greater-includes-the-lesser
kind
of
argument
going
for
you,
don't
you?
