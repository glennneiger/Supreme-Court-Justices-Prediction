we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
87-1865,
federal
savings
and
loan
insurance
corporation
v.
ticktin.
mr.
taranto?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
your
reliance
on
1345
goes
back
through
subsection
a
of
(k)(1).
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
the
proviso
apply
only
to
subsection
b
or
does
it
apply
to
subsection
a
too?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
taranto.
mr.
koch,
we
will
hear
from
you
now.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
koch,
how
do
you
explain
the
existence
of
subsection
a
then
where
they
say
fslic
shall
be
deemed
to
be
an
agency
of
the
united
states?
and
then
1345
says
when
the
united
states
is
plaintiff,
the
court
has
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
section
a
was
added
after
the
rest
of
1730(k)(1)
was
in
place?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
once
you
provide
that
the
fslic
is
an
agency,
why
doesn't
1345
kick
in?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
koch.
mr.
taranto,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
the
case
is
submitted.
