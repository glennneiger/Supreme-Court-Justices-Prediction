justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
taranto,
which
is
the
wrongest
of
the
three?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
not
so.
it...
it
would
have
an
effect
in
suits
against
fslic
where
fslic...
i
mean,
1345
only...
only
applies
where
fslic
is
the...
is
the
plaintiff--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so,
why
do
you
say
it
would
have
no
effect
whatsoever?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wouldn't
have
effect
in
those
suits,
but
it
would
have
effect
in
other
suits,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
koch,
you
said
the
purpose
of
adding
a
was
to
clarify
that
fslic
was
a
federal
agency.
i
mean,
that's...
that's
very
nice,
but
what
was
the
purpose
of
clarifying
it?
wasn't
the...
the
main
consequence
of
being
a
federal
agency
is
coming
under
1345
and
i
assume
the
removal
statute
as
well.
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
me
or
it
is
no
explanation
to
me
anyway
to
simply
say,
well,
the
only
purpose
of
a
was
to
clarify
that
it
was
a
federal
agency.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
was
it
clarified?
it
was
clarified
principally
because
of
1345
i
would
think.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
yes,
but
i
mean
disputes
don't
arise
in
the
abstract,
two
people
saying
i
am
agency.
no,
you're
not.
i
am.
you're
not.
i
mean,
who
cares?
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
something
hinges
upon
it.
and
the
main
thing
that
hinges
upon
it
is
1345,
isn't
it?
