but...
but
if
that
is
correct,
why
is
not
the
proviso
totally
redundant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but...
but
there
would
be
no
federal
jurisdiction
in
those
claims
anyway,
would
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
always
a
federal
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
whereas
the
agency
rationale
only
applies
when
fslic
brings
the
case,
is
that
the
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
you
treat
it
as
a
case
arising
under
federal
law,
you
would
run
into
the
language
of
the
proviso
i
suppose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
proviso
language
it
says
shall
not
be
deemed
to
arise
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states
would
mean
not
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states
within
the
meaning
of
article
iii,
but
rather
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
granting
federal
question
jurisdiction.
the
proviso
only...
only...
only
cuts
back
on
statutory
federal
question
jurisdiction
in
other
words.
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
could
read
it
the
other
way.
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
then...
then
one
has
to
assume
that
at
federal
agency
is
iii.
justice
john
paul
stevens
has
that...
have
we
had
any
cases
deciding
what
the
constitutional
foundation
of
federal
agency
jurisdiction
is?
i'm
not...
i'm
not
aware
of
any,
but
i
just--
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
what
hinged
on
it
in
the
ninth
circuit
case,
isn't
it?
wasn't
that
a
jurisdictional
dispute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so,
congress
resolved
that
by
saying
there
shall
be
jurisdiction
in
such
a
case.
