mr.
james
b.
koch
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
a
matter
of
congressional
intent
that
state
courts
in
the
first
instance
should
decide
an
issue
of
state
law
and
federal
courts
in
the
first
instance
should
decide
an
issue
of
federal
law.
however,
it's
petitioner's
position
in
this
case
that
due
to
the
significance
of
their
role
as
a
federal
regulator,
the
volume
of
litigation
and
the
spate
of
failures,
for
their
own
convenience,
they
seek
a
uniformity
of
decisions
through
the
federal
courts.
the
problem
with
following
that
policy
lies
in
the
fact
that
in
this
specific
instance
and
in
numerous
others,
the
federal
court
is
bound
by
the
state's
highest
court
when
it
has
considered
that
same
issue.
and
in
a
case
such
as
this
where
the
state
court
has
not
ruled,
the
federal
court
could
rule.
that
could
be
appealed
to
the
federal
appellate
court
on
up
to
this
court
and
then
at
that
or
any
other
time,
the
state
court
could
rule
contrary
to
the
decision
of
the
federal
courts.
and
you
would,
in
fact,
develop
a
dual
body
of
law.
i
believe
that
this
case
and
the
construction
of
1730(k)(1)
can't
properly
be
decided
without
some
notion
of
the
specifics
involved
and
the
general
policy
as
determined
by
the
senate
report
on
the
financial
institution
supervisory
act
which
states...
and
i
quote...
that
"the
general
policy
for
the
supervision
and
regulation
of
state
savings
and
loans
are
primarily
the
states'
affairs.
"
the
specific
cases
we
are
talking
about
here
are
collection
cases.
when
the
fslic
comes
into
state
court
as
a
receiver
for
a
state
savings
and
i
can,
the
type
of
cases
that
flood
the
state
courts
are
student
i
can
defaults,
can
defaults,
eviction
notices,
letters
of
credit.
it's
that
huge
volume
of
cases
that
the
congress
i
believe
determined
to
keep
out
of
federal
courts.
and
that's
why
they
set
up
for
the
fdic
and
the
fslic
a
unified
integrated
scheme
of
jurisdiction.
in
that
scheme
the
fdic
or
the
fslic,
under
either
12
u.s.c.
1819
fourth
or
12
u.s.c.
1730(k)(1),
in
its
corporate
capacity
as
the
federal
insurer
would
go
into
federal
court,
but
as
the
receiver
would
take
those
cases
which
properly
belong
in
state
court
to
state
courts.
and
quoting
from
the
courts
that
have
previously
determined
this,
for
example,
fdic
v.
elefant,
in
referring
to
the
legislative
history,
the
courts
noted
that
it
was
designed
to
prevent
the
fact
of
receivership
from
transferring
wholesale
to
federal
court
the
money
collection
suits
and
related
litigation
in
which
a
failed
thrift
will
become
embroiled.
mr.
james
b.
koch
that...
i
would
explain
it
as
follows.
in
1966
there
was
pending
in
the
ninth
circuit
the
case
of
acron
v.
fslic.
prior
to
1966,
the
only
way
fslic
could
come
into
federal
court
was
if
it
was
a
federal
agency,
and
13...
and
the
district
court
in
that
case
determined
that
fslic
was
a
federal
agency,
deemed
it...
there
was
a
dispute
as
to
the
question
of
law...
certified
it
to
the
ninth
circuit.
and
contrary
to
petitioner's
brief...
and
i
believe
i
have
it
in
the
footnote
at
my
last
page
of
my
brief...
the
fact
is
in...
in
march
the
congress
added
to
clarify
that
it,
in
fact,
was
a
federal
agency.
i
believe
that's
the
reason
for
it,
and
i
don't
believe
the
reason
was
to
wipe
out
or
read
out
of
existence
the
proviso,
merely
to
clarify
that
the
fslic
was
an
agency.
mr.
james
b.
koch
section
a
was
added
in
1966
to
clarify
that...
that
fslic
was
an
agency,
and
that
was
the...
under
the
financial
institution
supervisory
act
which
amended
both
1819
and
drafted
1730(k)(1).
mr.
james
b.
koch
thirteen
forty-five
begins
with
the
phrase
"except
as
otherwise
provided".
and
i
believe
that
the
proviso
in
this
case
is
just
that.
to
read
1345
as
precluding
all
cases
which
would
come
under
the
proviso
would
send
into
federal
court
this
floodgate
of
litigation
that
i've
just
described
and,
in
effect,
read
out
of
the
proviso.
the
proviso
would
have
no
effect
whatsoever.
mr.
james
b.
koch
that's
correct.
mr.
james
b.
koch
well,
on
those
suits
brought
against...
where
the
fslic
came
in
as
a
receiver
and
went
after
debtors,
presumably
if...
if
1345
jurisdiction
overrode
that
proviso--
mr.
james
b.
koch
--yes,
that's...
i
agree.
mr.
james
b.
koch
that's
true.
he
would
have
the
choice.
but
if
they're
seeking
a
uniformity
of
law
in
federal
courts
and
if
that's
the
policy
reason...
i
think
the
difference
i
have
with
the
petitioner
is
that
they
see
that
statute
as
being
to
determine
the
rights
of
the
claimants
against
the
assets
of
the
receivership,
whereas
both
the
senate
report
and
policy
would
indicate
that
the
fslic
is
there
on
its
own
behalf
on
the
rights
of
the
institution,
the
parties
named.
the
investors,
the
creditors
and
the
stockholders
are
generally
those
parties
who
would
have
an
interest
in
common
with
the
fslic
in
its
pursuit
of
suits
going
after
debtors
in
the
type
of
cases
i've
referred
to.
mr.
james
b.
koch
but
it--
mr.
james
b.
koch
--i
believe
it
was
clarified...
and
the
congressional
code
bears
this
out...
that...
to
make
clear
that
the
corporation
is
an
agency
of
the
united
states
because
at
that
time
in
the
acron
case
there
was
a
dispute
in
the
ninth
circuit
whether
or
not
it
was
an
agency
so
they
could
have
access
to
the
federal
courts.
mr.
james
b.
koch
well--
mr.
james
b.
koch
--i
agree.
mr.
james
b.
koch
it
was.
mr.
james
b.
koch
it
did.
and...
and
i
would
still
submit
that
the
1345
a;
saying
that
all
those
cases
when
fslic
comes
in
on
behalf
of
a
failed
thrift,
a
savings
and
i
can,
would
in
effect
read
out...
read
the
proviso
out
of
existence.
the
original
proviso
in
this
case,
12
u.s.c.
1819,
upon
1730(k)(1)
is
based
contained
only
the
grant
of
original
jurisdiction
and
the
limiting
proviso.
and
substantially
similar
language
in
1730(k)(1)
i
would
submit
is
also
a
grant
of
original
jurisdiction
and
the
limiting
proviso.
mr.
james
b.
koch
if
there
was
a...
a
federal
law
claim
that
predominated
or
was
the
cause
of
action
in
the
suit,
no,
i
would
submit
that
that
would
be
exactly
what
the
proviso
and
this
statute
had
in
mind.
in
this
case
it's
whether
there
is
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
under
state
law.
mr.
james
b.
koch
i
think
that
anytime
that
fslic
comes--
mr.
james
b.
koch
--well,
i
would...
i
would
disagree.
i
think
the
seventh
circuit
was
correct
in
pointing
out
that
anytime
fslic
or
fdic
or
a
federal
agency
is
involved
in
the
regulation
of
a
state
savings
and
loans
or
a
thrift,
there
is
always
going
to
be
a
federal
issue.
for
example,
he
cites
in
his
brief
the...
the
criminal
allegations.
in
fact,
those
were
separated
from
this
case.
one
of
the
respondents
in
this
case,
harold
ticktin,
was
in
fact
prosecuted
in
federal
court.
that
would
have
no
place
in
the
state.
mr.
james
b.
koch
no,
i
would...
i
would...
what
is
the
cause
of
action
in
this
suit?
if,
in
fact,
that
there
were
both,
i
would
say
that
they
would
have
the
right
to
go
into
federal
court,
but
in
this
specific--
mr.
james
b.
koch
--no,
i
think
not.
mr.
james
b.
koch
well,
i
think
that
specifically
in
this
case
the
cause
of
action
is
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
under
state
law.
fslic
is
saying
that
the
respondents
issued
dividends
in
violation
of
the
state
savings
and
loan
act,
which
made
no
reference
whatsoever
to
fslic
requirements.
and
that's
what
the
seventh
circuit
actually
described
as
the
cause
of
action
in
this
court.
the
resolution
of
that
issue
is
the
resolution
of
the
case
regardless
of
other
federal
causes
of
action
that...
that
may
arise.
none
are...
none
predominate
in
this
case.
all
support
the...
the
theory
that
it's
a
state
savings
and
loan
construction
statute.
that's
a
cause
of
action
that
must
ultimately
be
construed.
with
respect
to
the
subject
of
proviso
parties,
i
would
submit
the
seventh
circuit
was...
made
the
proper
decision
here.
in
the
case
of
fdic
v.
elefant,
the
fdic
informed
the
seventh
circuit
in
that
case
that
the
presence
of
a
non-proviso
party
would
still
deprive
the
federal
courts
of
jurisdiction.
that
was
their
position
in
the
seventh
circuit
as
recently
as
1986.
directors
are
those
type
of
adverse
parties
that
the
fslic
would
naturally
come
into
court
to
proceed
against.
and
i
would
submit
that
when
the
fslic
comes
into
court
to
enforce
the
rights
of
the
institution
and
the
resolution
of
those
rights
is
the
only
question
in
the
suit,
then
the
suit
involves
only
the
rights
or
obligations
of
the
institution
regardless
of
who
the
defendants
are.
and
interpreted
in
that
fashion
and
interpreted
with
a
policy
basis
to
keep
these
many,
many
collection
cases
out
of
federal
court,
the
focus
being
brought
by
the
receiver,
both
the
fslic
and
the
fdic,
serves
that
useful
purpose.
again,
it
keeps
those
case
out
of
federal
court.
i
would
submit
that
the
financial
institution
supervisory
act
which
set
out
this
jurisdictional
scheme
for
both
the
fdic
and
the
fslic
and
a
contrary
ruling
in
today's
case
in
the
fslic
would
set
up
a
separate
scheme.
the
fdic
could
go
into
state
court,
state
causes
of
action
on
an
identical
case
if
it
was
the
same
cause
of
action
for...
for
a
bank
as
opposed
to
a
savings
and
i
can.
i
would
submit
that
that's
not
the
provision...
or
not
the
intent
of
congress.
finally,
with
respect
to
the
agency
argument,
i
would
only
point
out
that
it
was
added,
according
to
congress,
to
clarify
a
reading
or
a
construction
of...
of
section
a
that
would
read
out
of
existence.
the
proviso
would
not
fulfill
policy
and,
in
fact,
would
say
that
all
those
cases
that
came
into...
or
the
fslic
went
into
federal
court
to
resolve
could
then
automatically
go
into...
to
federal
court.
to
give
federal
courts
indirectly
what
they
couldn't
have
through
the
proviso
i
believe
would
be
a...
a
fractured
route
to
go.
i
have
nothing
further.
