justice
byron
r.
white
so,
your
argument...
your
argument
is
that
even
though
a
case
might
be
literally
within
the
meaning
of
the
proviso,
1345
saves
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
don't
think
the
proviso
should
even
be...
even...
it
wasn't
a
general
intent
to
keep
this
kind
of
litigation
out
of
federal
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
congress
wanted
to
keep...
keep
state
law
cases
out
of
federal
courts,
it's
a
little
odd
to
say
that
they
nevertheless
would
let
them
in
under
1345.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
the...
what
about
the
federal
law
claims
that...
that
are
stated
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
would
say
that
the...
the
federal
law
claims
that
were
stated
in
this
complaint
would...
if
they're
covered
by
the
proviso,
they
also
cannot
be
litigated
under
1345.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
say
there
were
federal
law
claims
stated
in
the
complaint.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
my
question
is
suppose
that
those
federal
law
claims
are
covered
by
the
proviso.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
but...
but
so
you
could
litigate
the...
the
federal
law
claims
under
1345
also.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes--
justice
byron
r.
white
--okay.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
also...
it,
wouldn't
require
the
receiver
to
go
into
federal
court.
he
would
just
have
a
choice.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
wouldn't...
you
don't...
you
don't
say
that
the
proviso
keeps
out
of
federal
court
suits
by...
by
the
agency
asserting
a
federal
law
claim.
justice
byron
r.
white
you...
you
say...
there
is
just
no
bona
fide
federal
claim
in
this
case
you
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
isn't
the
way
i
understood
the
united
states.
justice
byron
r.
white
assuming
that
there's
a
bona
fide
federal
issue
stated
in
a...
in
a
suit
like
this
and
a
bona
fide
state
law
claim
made,
you
would
say
you
would
have
to
go
to
different
courts.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
take
the
state
cause
of
action
there
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
would
think...
have
to
pursue
the
claims
in
separate
courts.
