mr.
richard
g.
taranto
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
the
fslic,
or
fslic,
as
the
receiver
of
an
insolvent
state-chartered
savings
and
loan
has
access
to
federal
court
to
bring
a
damages
action
against
directors
and
officers
of
the
institution
for
their
violations
of
duties
imposed
by
federal
as
well
as
state
law.
two
jurisdictional
statutes
are
involved:
section
1345
of
title
28
which
provides
generally
for
federal
agency
jurisdiction
in
federal
court,
and
section
1730(k)(1)
of
title
22...
of
title
12
which
more
specifically
addresses
jurisdiction
in
cases
involving
fslic.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
there
was
no
federal
jurisdiction
over
this
case
under
either
of
those
statutes.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes,
a
new
bill
has
been
introduced.
it
was
introduced
last
wednesday,
the
administration's
comprehensive
fslic
bail-out
bill.
we
sent
a
letter
up
to
the
court
on
friday
that
attempted
to
outline
some
of
the
provisions
that
would
be...
would
be
relevant.
as
of
now,
of
course,
the
bill
is
merely
proposed
and--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--it...
it
may
well
end
this
case.
the...
the
new
bill
would
create
a
new
transition
entity
that
would
take
the
place
of
fslic
for
all
current
receiverships
and
receiverships
for
the
next
three
years.
that
new
entity
has
a
special
jurisdictional
provision
which
contains
no
exception
to
federal
jurisdiction.
we
would
believe
that
that
would,
in
fact,
solve
the
jurisdictional
problem
here,
although
there
may
be
some
argument
about
that.
this
case
arose
as
a
result
of
two
dividends
declared
by
respondents
as
directors
of
the
manning
savings
and
loan
association,
a
state-chartered
thrift
that
was
insured
by
fslic.
in
1980
manning's
directors
declared
a
dividend
of
more
than
$400,000.
the
dividend
was
doubly
illegal
and
it
was
excessive
by
more
than
$300,000
because
manning
had
insufficient
net
worth
and
reserves
under
the
fslic's
regulations
and,
therefore,
also
under
state
law.
in
late
1981
after
fslic
charged
manning...
manning's
directors
with
having
violated
the
federal
requirements,
a
cease
and
desist
order
was
entered
by
a
federal
court
prohibiting
manning's
directors
from
paying
any
dividends
except
in
accordance
with
state
law.
in
april
1982,
fslic
issued
new
charges
advising
manning's
directors
that
manning
now
had
operating
losses
of
roughly
$300,000
per
month
and
had
a
negative
net
worth
of
more
than
2
million...
of
more
than
$500,000
which
was
more
than
$2
million
short
of
the
amount
required
to
maintain
its
fslic
insurance.
despite
those
charges,
respondents
as
directors
of
manning
declared
a
dividend
worth
more
than
$300,000
the
following
month.
that
dividend,
like
the
1980
dividend,
was
illegal
under
both
federal
and
state
law
and
was,
therefore,
also
a
violation
of
the
federal
cease
and
desist
order.
in
february
1983,
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board
found
that
manning
was
insolvent
and
had
incurred
substantial
dissipation
of
assets
as
a
result
of
illegal
and
unsafe
practices.
the
board
therefore
placed
manning
in
receivership
and
appointed
fslic
to
be
the
receiver.
in
that
capacity,
fslic
brought
this
suit
against
respondents
in
may
1983.
the
complaint,
among
other
things,
sought
damages
under
state
law
for
respondents'
breach
of
their
state
law
fiduciary
duties.
in
support
of
the
claim,
fslic
alleged
that
respondents
violated
federal
obligations
in
several
ways:
by
declaring
dividends
that
were
illegal
under
the
federal
net
worth
and
reserve
requirements,
by
causing
manning
to
violate
the
federal
conflict
of
interest
regulations,
and
by
causing
manning
to
violate
the
cease
and
desist
order.
respondents
moved
to
dismiss
for
lack
of
federal
jurisdiction.
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
jurisdiction,
but
certified
an
interlocutory
appeal
on
the
question.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
concluding
that
under
section
1730(k)(1)
there
was
no
federal
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
section
1730(k)(1)
has
four
parts.
the
first,
clause
(a),
declares
that
fslic
is
an
agency
within
the
meaning
of
the
definitional
section
of
title
28.
the
second
part,
clause
(b),
sweepingly
declares
that
all
civil
suits
to
which
fslic
is
a
party
are
deemed
to
arise
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
are
within
the
district
court's
jurisdiction.
clause
(c)
grants
broad
removal
authority,
but
is
not
specifically
at
issue
in
this
case.
finally,
there
is
the
proviso
which
declares
that
any
suit
to
which
fslic
is
a
party
in
its
capacity
as
receiver
of
a
fslic-insured
state-chartered
institution
and
"which
involves
only
the
rights
or
obligations
of
investors,
creditors,
stockholders
and
such
institution
under
state
law
shall
not
be
deemed
to
arise
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
"
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
the
proviso
applied
to
this
case
and
precluded
federal
jurisdiction.
first
the
court
ruled
that
the
proviso's
requirement
that
the
case
involve
"only
the
rights
or
obligations
of
investors,
creditors,
stockholders
and
the
institution.
"
is
satisfied
whenever,
as
in
this
case,
the
only
rights
in
the
case
are
those
of
the
falled
thrift.
second,
the
court
ruled
that
a
case
involves
"only
rights
or
obligations
under
state
law.
"
whenever,
as
is
true
here,
the
cause
of
action
arises
only
under
state
law,
even
if
federal
law
questions
are
involved
in
determining
if
state
law
was
violated.
since
manning
was
a
state-chartered
thrift
and
the
claims
at
issue
were
brought
by
fslic
in
its
capacity
as
receiver
of
manning,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
proviso
applied
and
precluded
the
broad
federal
question
jurisdiction
granted
by
clause
(b)
of
section
1730(k)(1).
the
court
further
concluded
that
despite
the
declaration
in
clause
(a),
that
fslic
is
an
agency
for
title
28
purposes,
the
proviso
must
also
preclude
the
federal
agency
jurisdiction
that
would
otherwise
be
available
under
28
u.s.c.
1345.
in
the
court's
view,
the
section
1730(k)(1)
proviso
was
designed
to
state
an
absolute
limit
on
federal
jurisdiction
under
any
jurisdiction
granting
statute.
my
argument
today
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
incorrect
in
all
three
of
its
conclusions
and
that
both
section
1730(k)(1)'s
clause
(b)
and
section
1345
furnish
jurisdiction
over
this
cases.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes,
that's
correct.
we
have
to
win
on...
on
only...
only
one
of
the
arguments.
the...
there
is
something
of
a
difference
in
the
relative
importance
for
other
cases
of
the...
the
various
positions.
the...
the...
our
first
point
about
the
limitation
of
the
proviso
to
disputes
among
proviso
parties
is
the
one
that
has
divided
the
courts
of
appeals,
but
the
other
issues
are
also
important
in
other
cases.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes.
we...
we
think
that
1345
would
apply
even
without
clause
(a)
of...
of
section
1730(k)(1)
because
clause
(a)
merely
confirms
what
would
be
evident
in
any
case;
namely,
that
fslic,
when
acting
as
a
receiver,
is
a
federal
agency
carrying
out
federal
programs.
and
hence,
for
example,
the
very
similar
jurisdictional
statute
that
applies
to
the
fdic,
which
contains
no
analogue
to
clause
(a),
would
reach...
we
would
reach
the
same
result.
there
would
also
be
section
1345
jurisdiction
for
the
fdic.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
can't
tell
you
which
covers
a
larger
number
of
cases.
there
is
a
very
substantial
overlap
because
most
of
the
cases
that
involve
non-proviso
parties,
directors,
officers,
debtors,
are
also
cases
that
are
brought
by
fslic
and,
hence,
there
would
be
jurisdiction
under...
under
both
of
them.
i'm
not
sure
whether
one
of
the
classes
of
cases
is...
is
actually
larger
than
the
other.
it
is
a
rare
thing
for
fslic
to
sue
one
of
the
proviso
parties,
and
that...
that
suggests
that
maybe
the...
our
first
argument
about
the
limitation
of
the
proviso
to
the
named
parties
is...
is
a
somewhat
broader
argument.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
i...
i
hesitate
to...
to
say
which...
which
error
is
of
greater
magnitude.
the...
the
one
that
probably
jumps
more
plainly
off
the
face
of
the
statute
is
the...
is
the
section
1345
argument
because
that
argument
is
one
that...
that
we
think
is...
is
just
flatly
inconsistent
with
the
language
of
the
proviso.
our
other
two
arguments
are
arguments
for
the
better
interpretation
of
the--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
the
proviso
would
still
cover
ordinary
cases
involving
claims
by...
by
creditors,
shareholders,
investors
seeking
to,
in
effect,
get
a
piece
of
the
pie
to
divide
up
the
receivership
estate.
ordinarily
those
would
be
claims
brought
simply
to
enforce
the
state
law
rights
of--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
absent
the
proviso,
there
would
under
clause
(b)
because
clause
(b)
says
there
is
always
federal
jurisdiction
whenever
fslic
is
a
party.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes,
and
hence,
there
would
be...
there
would
be
federal
jurisdiction.
clause
(b)
eliminates
the
usual--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--yes,
that's
right.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
that's
right.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
and
the
court
of...
under
the
court
of
appeals'
view,
clause
(a)
would...
would
effectively
be
read
out
of
the
statute
because
if
the
proviso
eliminates
jurisdiction
under
1345,
as
well
as
under
clause
(b),
then
clause
(a)
adds
nothing
whatever
to
the...
to
the
statute.
the
jurisdictional
provisions
at
issue
here
reflect
the
important
federal
programmatic
interests
that
are
at
stake
when
fslic
as
receiver
tries
to
recover
from
directors
and
officers
whose
violations
of
their
legal
obligations
have
led
to
the
failure
of
thrifts
all
across
the
nation.
congress
provided
for
fslic
to
act
as
receiver
of
state
thrifts
precisely
because
of
the
important
federal
interest
at
stake,
and
the
present
crisis
in
the
fslic-insured
thrift
system
starkly
confirms
congress'
judgment.
the
ability
to
collect
from
directors
and
officers
of
failed
thrifts,
among
others,
directly
affects
the
amount
of
money
that
the
fslic
fund
can
recover
for
its
payouts
in
a
particular
receivership.
it
also
may
affect
the
health
of
the
fslic
insurance
fund
as
a
whole
and,
hence,
the
ability
of
fslic
to
handle
other
thrift
failures
and
ultimately
the
u.s.
treasury
if,
as
has
happened,
the
fund
proves
inadequate.
in
addition
to
the
financial
effect,
recovering
from
directors
and
officers
in
particular
serves
the
broader
federal
interest
in
deterring
future
misconduct
and
future
thrift
failures.
in
all
of
those
ways,
there
is
a
strong
federal
interest
in...
in
fslic's
ability
to
pursue
claims
in
each
receivership,
and
that
is
why
section
1730(k)(1)
clause
(b)
broadly
declares
that
there
is
federal
jurisdiction
whenever
fslic
is
a
party,
and
that
is
why
clause
(a)
confirms
that
fslic,
like
any
other
agency
that
is
specifically
authorized
to
sue,
may
bring
its
suits
in
federal
court.
the
proviso
as
an
exception
to
those
grants
of
jurisdiction
should
be
read
against
this
background.
and
all
three
grounds
for
reversing
the
court
of
appeals
reflect
the
important
federal
interests
at
stake
in
suits
like
the
present
one.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
we
think
that...
that
it...
it
does
not
apply
to
clause
(a)
because
clause
(a)
in
confirming
that
fslic
is
an
agency,
confirms
that
section
1345
of
title
28
grants
jurisdiction.
that's
a
jurisdiction
that
does
not
depend
at
all
on
whether
there's
a
federal
question.
and
the
proviso
merely
says
in
cases
in
which
it
applies,
those
cases
shall
not
be
deemed
to
arise
under
laws
of
the
united
states.
so,
the
proviso
eliminates
federal
question
jurisdiction,
but
leaves
any
other
basis
of
jurisdiction
that
would
otherwise
be
available
unimpaired.
section
1345
is
just
such
a
basis
of
jurisdiction.
our
first
argument
concerning
the
non-proviso
parties
was
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
concluding
that
this
case,
to
quote
the
proviso,
"involves
only
the
rights
or
obligations
of
investors,
creditors,
stockholders
and
the
failed
thrift.
"
that
is
not
so
in
this
case.
this
case
involves,
in
addition
to
the
rights
of
manning,
the
failed
thrift,
also
the
obligations
of
directors
and
officers,
and...
and
directors
and
officers
are
not
among
those
listed
in
the
proviso.
the
proviso
we
think
by
its
terms
is
properly
construed
not
to
apply
unless
the
dispute
is
solely
among
parties
listed
in
the
proviso
with
fslic
representing
the
failed
thrift.
this
construction
is
the
only
one
that
accounts
for
the
decision
by
congress
to
list
particular
parties
as
it
did,
listing
those
with
claims
against
the
receivership,
as
well
as
the...
the
failed
thrift
and
omitting
such
persons
as
directors,
officers
and
debtors
who
are
commonly
sued
by
a
receiver.
if
the
court
of
appeals
were
correct
that
the
proviso
applies
whenever
the
only
rights
involved
are
those
of
the
failed
thrift,
then
the
listing
of
investors,
creditors
and
stockholders
would
be
read
out
of
the
statute.
the
listing
also
undermines
respondents'
view
that
the
provision
contemplates
fslic's
representing
the
interests
of
the
named
parties,
for
fslic
as
a
receiver
of
a
failed
thrift
always
must
represent
the
failed,
thrift
and
the
collective
interests
of
its
investors,
creditors
and
stockholders.
the
listing
is
simply
given
no
effect
in
respondents'
view.
in
addition,
respondents'
suggestion
invokes
a
wholly
unrealistic
picture
of
a
unity
of
interests
among
the
listed
parties.
in
fact,
a
very
substantial
number
of
suits
involving
fslic
as
receiver
pit
the
obligations
of
the
failed
thrift
against
those
of
investors
or
creditors
or
stockholders.
and
as
we
explained
in
our
brief,
it
is
entirely
plausible
that
among
all
the
persons
who
might
be
parties
to
a
suit
involving
fslic
as
a
receiver,
congress
omitted
the
likely
defendants
in
suits
brought
by
the
receiver
and
instead
listed
only
those
who
have
claims
against
the
receivership
estate,
insiders
who
are
more
likely
to
initiate
suit
to
recover
from
the
estate
than
to
be
sued.
the
process
of
dividing
up
the
estate
among
claimants
is
traditionally
centralized
in
the
single
forum
having
jurisdiction
over
the
estate
property,
and
where
that
forum
was
a
state
authority
for
state
thrifts,
the
proviso
was
needed
to
make
possible
the
continued
centralizing
of
claims
by
insiders
in
that
forum.
by
contrast,
the
process
by
which
a
receiver
brings
suit
against
outsiders
to
collect
debts
to
the
receivership
estate
is
not
traditionally
centralized,
and
there
was,
therefore,
no
corresponding
need
to
carve
out
an
exception
to
the
broad
grant
of
federal
jurisdiction.
the
second
way
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
was
in
concluding
that
this
case
"involves
only
rights
or
obligations
under
state
law.
"
this
case
also
involves
the
obligations
of
respondents
under
federal
law.
in
particular,
the
complaint
alleges
a
central
support
for
the
claimed
breach
of
duty
that
respondents
violated
their
obligations
under
the
federal
regulation
requiring
the
maintenance
of
specified
reserves
and
net
worth
under
a
federal
conflict
of
interest
regulation
and
under
the
federal
cease
and
desist
order.
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
because
it
read
the
proviso
to
apply
whenever
the
cause
of
action
arises
under
state
laws,
as
the
right
to
damages
does
in
this
case.
but
the
proviso
does
not
use
that
familiar
term
in
referring
to
the
rights
or
obligations
that
are
involved
in
covered
cases.
by
contrast,
section
1730(k)(1)
elsewhere
twice
uses
the
"arises
under"
language,
once
in
the
proviso
itself.
the
proviso
does
not
apply
where
the
case
involves
obligations
under
federal
law,
as
this
one
does.
that
congress
granted
federal
jurisdiction
whenever
questions
under
federal
law
are
involved
in
a
case
is
fully
in
keeping
with
the
policy
reflected
in
the
sweeping
declaration
of
clause
(b),
that
all
cases
involving
fslic
are
deemed
to
arise
under
federal
law.
and
it
also
is
consistent
with
our
first
point,
that
the
proviso
was
designed
in
claims
against
the
receivership
assets
in
mind.
such
suits,
unlike
suits
brought
by
fslic
as
receiver,
often
involve
only
state
law
questions.
suits
against
directors
and
officers,
by
contrast,
often
involve
federal
duties
that
are
imposed
in
order
to
maintain
a
sound
thrift
system.
the
third
way
we
believe
the
court
of
appeals
erred
was
in
ruling
that
the
proviso
ousts
federal
courts
of
jurisdiction
under
section
1345.
the
language
of
the
proviso
will
not
support
such
a
ruling.
the
proviso
simply
declares
that
cases
within
its
coverage
"shall
not
be
deemed
to
arise
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
"
that
language
eliminates
only
arising
under
federal
question
jurisdiction.
it
leaves
jurisdictional
bases
for
no
federal
question
is
necessary
wholly
unaffected.
section
1345
establishes
one
such
basis.
a
federal
agency
may
bring
suit
in
federal
court
regardless
of
whether
its
claim
arises
under
federal
or
state
law.
the
proviso,
therefore,
leaves
section
1345
jurisdiction
unimpaired.
there
is
no
reason
to
depart
from
this
plain
reading
of
the
proviso.
to
the
contrary,
as
i
have
explained,
reading
the
proviso
to
eliminate
federal
agency
jurisdiction,
as
well
as
section
1730(k)(1)'s
clause
(b)
federal
question
jurisdiction,
would
render
clause
(a)
redundant
because
clause
(a)
and
the
section
1345
jurisdiction...
it
confirms
would
then
be...
never
be
available
unless
clause
(b)
jurisdiction
were
not
also--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--a
case
that
comes
literally
within
the
meaning
of...
within
the
coverage
of
the
proviso
would
still
come
within
1345
jurisdiction
because
the
proviso
merely
says
there's
no
federal
question
jurisdiction.
it
doesn't
say
there's
no
federal
agency
jurisdiction,
there's
no
diversity
jurisdiction,
there's
no
other
jurisdiction
that
might
otherwise
be
available
without
regard
to
whether
the
case
arises--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
i
think
that's
right.
the
history
of
the
proviso
accounts
for
what
may
well
have
been
some
inadvertence
to
the
full
range
of...
of
implications.
this
proviso
for
fslic
was
enacted
in
1966.
it
was
essentially
copied
from
the
fdic's
proviso,
its
jurisdictional
statute,
which
had
been
enacted
back
in
1935.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
we
don't
think
that
there
is
any
evidence
that
congress
broadly
wanted
to
keep
all
state
law
cases
out
of
federal
court.
in
fact,
clause
(b)
suggests
exactly
the
opposite.
it
says
that
in
general
all
you
need
is
for
fslic
to
be
a
party,
and
we
deem
it
to
arise
under
federal
law,
and
the
case
will
be
in
federal
court
even
if
absent
fslic's
party
status
the
case
would
be
entirely
one
under
state
law.
we
think
that
the
better
interpretation
here
is
that
the
proviso
was
aimed
only
at
this
process
of
dividing
up
the
estate--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
those...
those
claims
have
been
dismissed
and...
and
we
have
not
appealed
from
the
ruling
that
the
particular
federal--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
the
federal...
i'm...
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
understand.
federal
law
claims--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--yes.
and
the
district
court
ruled
that
there
was
no
private
right
of
action
or
no
right
of
action
to...
to
sue
under
this.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
they...
they
wouldn't
be
because
the
proviso
specifically
covers
only
cases
involving
rights
or
obligations
under
state
law.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
so,
they
would...
they
would
be
outside
the
proviso
in
any--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--yes,
or
under
1331--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--or
under
clause
(b).
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
with...
if
there
were
actual
federal
questions
involved,
there
would
be
numerous
bases
of
jurisdiction.
question:
mr.
taranto,
may
i...
maybe
this
is
a
stupid
question,
but
what
is
the
constitutional
basis
for
agency
jurisdiction?
well,
it
is
at
least
the
provision
of
article
iii
that
gives
the
federal
courts
jurisdiction
over
all
controversies
involving...
to
which
the
united
states
is
a
party,
which
is
a
separate
jurisdictional
basis
from
arising
under
jurisdiction.
in
fact,
i
think
there
is
a
very
substantial
argument
that
any
of...
any
case
involving
the
rights
or
obligations
of
a
federal
agency
can
be
made
by
congress
into
a
case
arising
under
federal
law.
that
would
be
consistent
with
the
traditional
approach
that
this
court
has
taken
in
federal
common
law
cases.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
except...
except
that
the...
the
arising
under
heading
of
article
iii
i
think
has
always
been
broader
than
the
arising
under
jurisdiction
of
1331,
there
being
no
well-pleaded
complaint
rule
and
such.
congress--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--congress
here
says
that
whenever
the...
whenever
fslic
is
a
party
to
a
case,
we
deem
all
of
those
cases
to
arise
under
federal
law.
we
think
that's...
that
would
be...
even
absent
the...
the
article
iii
heading
of
controversies
involving
the
united
states,
which
is
in
any
event
the
primary
basis...
even
absent
that,
that
would
be
consistent
with
this
court's
cases
in
kimball
foods
and
other...
and
other
cases--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--i
think
that...
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
right.
in...
in
any
event,
it
wouldn't...
it
wouldn't
extend
into
those
jurisdictional
bases
that
don't
depend
on
federal
question
jurisdiction
either--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--yes,
that's
right.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i'm...
i'm
not
aware
of
any
off
the
top
of
my
head
either.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
save
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
nothing
further.
