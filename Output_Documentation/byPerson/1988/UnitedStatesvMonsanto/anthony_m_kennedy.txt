that's
true
even
as
to
assets
that
are
in
the
possession
of
the
defendant?
suppose
the
trial
discloses
that
there
are
assets
in
possession
of
the
defendant
that
were
derived
from
illegal
proceeds,
and
the
indictment
does
not
name
those
assets.
as
take
it,
under
853(a),
the
court
must
ordered
those
forfeited.
justice
kennedy
the
statute
doesn't...
the
statute
doesn't
require
that,
does
it?
justice
kennedy
mr.
bryson,
you
do
not
challenge
in
this
case
the
ruling
of
the
second
circuit
panel
on
procedural
due
process.
justice
kennedy
the...
the
respondents
have
it
in
their
red
brief
as
question
4.
and
so
you
think
that
question
is
not
properly
before
us?
