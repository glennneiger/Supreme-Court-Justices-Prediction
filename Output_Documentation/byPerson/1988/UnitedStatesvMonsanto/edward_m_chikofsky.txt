mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
another
side
of
the
coin
of
the
question
that
the
court
has
been
hearing
for
the
last
hour
with
regard
to
a
question
involving
a
defendant's
right
to
retain
counsel
of
his
own
choosing
to
defend
him
in
his
controversy
with
his
sovereign,
and
the
government's
ability
to
interfere
with
that
right
by
stripping
the
defendant
at
the
outset
of
the
criminal
proceedings
of
his
economic
resources
by
which
he
may
defend
himself.
but
i
think
that
a
very
important
point
that
is
also
raised
in
this
case
that
has
only
been
adverted
to
but
briefly
is
the
question
that
should
be
considered
here
as
to
whether
or
not
congress,
in
enacting
the
comprehensive
forfeiture
act
of
1984
in
resolving
this
question,
even
realized
that
its
enactment
of
the
statute
in
question,
authorizing
a
restraint
of
all
of
a
defendant's
enumerated
assets
prior
to
trial,
would
totally
abrogate
a
defendant's
ability
to
retain
counsel,
much
less
whether
congress
expressly
intended
to
do
so.
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
no.
in
fact,
i
am
making
a...
a
distinction
between
whether
or
not
it
realized
it
was
doing
so
in
the
first
instance,
or
whether
it
intended
to
do
so.
and
it's
our--
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
--absolute...
absolutely.
however,
i
think
there
is...
as
this
court
well
recognizes
and
our
discussion
of
the
catholic
bishop
line
of
cases
enumerates
that
there
is
a
great
difference
in
this
court's
analysis
of
a
congressional
statute
where
serious
constitutional
ramifications
are
raised
by
congress'
possible
lack
of
consideration
of
a
particular
issue
or
whether
we're
dealing
with
a
simple
statute...
a
question
of
statutory
construction.
in
sedima,
you
didn't
have
necessarily,
for
example,
any
serious
constitutional
overtones.
it
was
merely
a
question
of
whether
congress
in
enacting
a
particular
statute
intended
it
to
cover
a
certain
course
of
conduct
or
not.
in
this
case,
this
has
been
a
statute
that
was
enacted
in
order
to...
admittedly
to
tighten
the
pretrial
restraint
and
the
criminal--
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
--i'm
saying
that
you
cannot
do
that
if
one
is
going
to
be
consonant
with
catholic
bishop.
in
fact,
the
catholic
bishop
opposes
the
test
in
exactly
the
opposite
way.
they
say
that
where
a
serious
constitutional
question
is
raised,
unless
congress
has
spoken
with
an
expressly
clear
voice,
either
in
the
words
of
the
statute
or
in
its
legislative
history,
to
intend
to
have
that
kind
of
an
impact
or
that
it,
in
fact,
at
least
considered
the
issue,
that
under
those
particular
circumstances,
the
statute
must
be
construed
in
such
a
way
as
to
avoid
the
constitutional
question
following
the
prudential
concerns
in
the
ashwander
decision.
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
this
is
true.
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
there's
no
exception
for
attorneys'
fees,
but
i
think
what's
important
is...
is
that
when...
when
this
statute
was
passed,
there
was
no
consideration
as
to
the
possible
sixth
amendment
ramifications
that
would
exist.
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
well--
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
--no.
there
is
an...
there
is
an
intermediate
position
which
i'm
suggesting
to
the
court.
obviously
one
of
the
two
antipodal
positions
your
honor
suggests,
either
of...
facing
the
constitutional
issue
head
on,
directly
and
deciding
it
to
be
either
constitutional
or
unconstitutional
would
be
one
way.
rewriting
the
statute
might
be
another
way.
but
an
intermediate
course
that
has
been
suggested
in
numerous
instances,
most
recently
by
justice
o'connor
in
thompson
v.
oklahoma
last
year,
is
the
concept
of
interpreting
the
statute
in
such
a
way
as
to
give
congress
the
opportunity
for
a
second
look
at
the
statute
before
you
decide
on
the
constitutional
question,
that
in
effect
the
people's
enacted
representatives,
the
legislature,
should
be
the
first
body
in
question
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
really
intended
constitutional
values
to
be
infringed.
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
the...
excuse
me?
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
catholic
bishop
suggested
it,
and
i
know
that
justice
o'connor's
opinion
in...
her
concurring
opinion
in
thompson
v.
oklahoma
said
exactly
that.
she
did
not,
of
course,
cite
to
the
catholic
bishop
rationale
but
she
used
the
catholic
bishop
analysis
in
which
she
said...
and
i
believe
the
debartolo
case
was
one
possible
case
in
which
the
court
may
well
have
done
that,
that
in
those
particular
kinds
of
cases,
the
court
need
not
and,
in
fact,
should
not
in
the
first
instance
read
the
statute
to...
or
decide
the
constitutional
issue
unless
and
until
congress
has
considered
it
in
the
first
instance
given
the
extraordinary
impact--
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
--well,
there
is
the...
the
certification
procedure
as
to
particular
kinds
of
questions.
that
is
true.
nonetheless,
this
court
what
this
court
can
do
and
in
these
particular
kinds
of
cases
is
they
would,
in
effect,
be
deferring
to
congress
for
the
initial
consideration
as
to
whether
or
not
they
intended
attorneys'
fees
to
apply
where
congress
never
gave
any
indication
that
it
seriously
consideration
the
many
ramifications
of
the
issue.
and
it
could
do
so
in
such
a
way
without
necessarily
doing
violence
to
the
statute
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction.
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
that's
the--
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
--well:
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
--legislative
history
might
be
sufficient
if
congress
spoke
a
clear
enough
of
a
voice,
except
the
only
problem
with
legislative
history,
of
course,
is
that
when
you're
dealing
with
a
committee
report
as
opposed...
or
a
house
report
as
opposed
to
necessarily
congress
speaking
in
terms
of
the
wording
of
the
statute,
that
would,
of
course,
give
the
court
the
clearest
indication.
but
as
i
says
this
is
a
matter
of
very,
very
difficult
line-drawing.
nonetheless,
i
think
congress
knows
how
to,
when
it
wants
to,
state
clearly
enough
what
its
intentions
are,
be
it
either
in
their
committee
reports
or
in
the
debates
or
in
the
statute
itself
as
to
whether
or
not
this
was
intended.
in
fact,
there
were
some
discussions
with
regard
to
the
money
laundering
statutes,
which
i
cite
to
you
by
analogy,
not
to
invoke
post-enactment
legislative
history,
but
in
which
there
were
serious
questions
about
whether
or
not
an
attorney
fee
exception
should
be
added.
and
among
the
questions
in
the
debates
were,
gee,
if
we
add
an
attorney
fee
exception
under
those
kinds
of
circumstances,
it
might
be
interpreted
by
the
courts
to
say
that
only
attorneys
are
entitled
to
an
exception,
and
we
might
not
necessarily
want
to
limit
it
to
that
kind
of
a
degree.
so,
the
point
is
is
that
legislative
debates
are
of
limited
utility.
it
would
be
much
better
if
congress
spoke
clearly
in
terms
of
the
statute.
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
then
i
think
we've
got
a
square
sixth
amendment
question
with
regard
to
whether
or
nut
this
has
a
unconstitutional
impact
on
counsel
the
defendant's--
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
--right
to
counsel
of
choice.
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
i
make
no
such
concession,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
well,
the
defendant
received
a
hearing,
but
let
me
back
up
a
little
bit
to
give
the
court
a
little
bit
of
the
procedural
context.
i
discuss
it
somewhat
in
one
of
the
footnotes
in
my
reply
brief
which
makes
it
a
little
bit
clearer.
when
the
panel
decided...
the
original
monsanto
panel
decided
this
case,
and
while
the
case
was
retrial...
and
this
was
in
december
of
1987...
they
directed
that
a--
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
--it
is
not.
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
there
has
since
been
a
trial.
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
i
will...
i
will
take
the
court
through...
through
the
procedures
quickly.
at
the
december
opinion,
the
panel
in
monsanto,
while
the
case
was
still
at
a
pretrial
phase,
set
up
a
hearing
and
said
that
a
hearing
should
be
held
but
it
limited
the
hearing
to
a
two-pronged
test,
probable,
likelihood
of
conviction
and
probable
likelihood
of
forfeiture
of
the
assets,
and
it
specifically
directed
that
no
other
aspects
be
explored
into.
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
do
not
apply.
the
district
court
held
a
hearing
in
january
of
1988
on
that
question,
the
case
still
being
at
the
pretrial
posture.
at
that
hearing,
the
court
then
made
its
findings
of
fact.
we
raised
numerous
objections
at
that
hearing
to
various
aspects
of
procedural
due
process
to
which
we
were
denied:
failure
to
accord
defendant
simmons/castigar
immunity
so
that
he
might
testify
or
possibly
present
evidence;
questions
of
the
failure
to
apply
the
balancing
test
that
applied
in
united
states
v.
thier,
the
then-existing
law
in
the
fifth
circuit
as
to
the
necessary
impact
that
this
might
have
on
the
defendant:
failure
to
apply
the
federal
rules
of
evidence;
numbers
of
other
aspects
that
were
enumerated
in...
in
our
brief
and
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
association
of
the
bar
of
the
city
of
new
york.
the...
also,
we
argued
that
the
clear
and
convincing
evidence
test
should
be
applied.
the
district
judge
denied
our
application
after
this
hearing,
and
within
two
days
thereafter...
we
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
from
that.
within
two
days
thereafter
en
banc
review
was
granted
by
the
second
circuit
of
the
initial
panel
decision.
in
the
interim,
appeal
of
our
initial
monsanto
hearing
was,
in
effect,
brought
in
abeyance.
and
when
the
en
banc
court
of
appeals
considered
this
question
in
the
second
circuit,
they
did
not
consider
the
actual
hearing
itself.
they
merely
considered
the
legal
standard
that
had
been
directed
to
be
applied
by
the
panel
so...
the
so-called
two-pronged
test.
we,
of
course,
briefed
and
argued
the
various
procedural
defaults
that
were
found
at
that
hearing.
the
court
en
banc,
without
reaching
that,
basically
abolished
the
two-pronged
test
on
a
variety
of
nationales
and
came
up
with
a
new
test
of
its
own.
so,
the
second
circuit,
in
effect,
has
never
considered
at
this
point...
and,
in
fact,
it
was
not
even
part
of
the
record
on
appeal,
en
banc...
the
propriety
of
the
findings
of
facts
and
conclusions
of
law
of
the
district
court
as
to
whether
the
defendant
received
procedural
due
process
or
whether
the
findings
were
properly
supported
in
the
record.
and--
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
--excuse
me?
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
it
was
sent
back
to
the
district
court
while
the
trial
was
still
in
abeyance.
the
en
banc
court
inconsistently
recalled
its
mandate
to
hear
the
case
en
banc,
but
nonetheless
allowed
the
trial
to
proceed.
the
matter
went
back
to
trial.
the
en
banc
decision
was
rendered
on
july
1st
while
the
case
was
in
summations.
it
was
a
five-month
trial,
a
16,000-page
trial
record.
we
applied
to
the
district
judge
on
the
basis
of
it
for
a
mistrial.
that
motion
was
denied
on
the
basis
that
in
the
event
of
conviction,
these
matters
could
be
then
raised
on
direct
appeal
and
on
the
basis
that
there
was
the
possible
likelihood
that
this
court
might
well
consider
the
en
banc
consideration.
so,
in
effect,
the
defendant
was
denied
his
right
to
counsel
of
choice
at
the
trial
itself
because,
as
even
the
district
judge
recognized,
while
he
as
a
formality,
compiled
with
the
en
banc
court's
decision
and
said
if
you
want
to
bring
in
a
new
lawyer
right
now
and
retain
him
out
of
these
funds,
i'll
let
you
do
so
but
he
openly
recognized
on
the
record...
he
said
that
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings
in
the
middle
of
summation
of
a
16,000-page
record,
it's
an
impossibility.
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
well...
well,
this
was
by...
this
was
by
agreement--
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
--this
was
by
agreement
with
the
parties.
we
had...
i
think
partially
for
the
convenience
of
the...
of
the
court
and...
and
of
the
parties.
there
was
no
specific
procedural
rational.
this
was
done
on
consent--
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
--of
the
parties.
but
i
think
that
we've
got...
what
we've
got
to
get
to
now
is
i
think
we've
got
to
face
head
on
the
serious
constitutional
issue
that
we're
involved
here
in
terms
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
of
choice.
unlike
such
cases
as
wheat
and
other
cases,
we're
dealing
here
not
with
an
individual
defendant's
right
to
use
a
particular
lawyer
and
to
balance
that
right
against
various
other
systemic
considerations
that
the
court
might
have
in
terms
of
conflict
of
interest,
the
integrity
of
the
trial
process,
or
what
have
you,
such
that
even
if
that
defendant
was
denied
his
right
to
that
particular
lawyer,
he
nonetheless
had
to
the
right
to
other
counsel
of
choice.
we're
dealing
here
with
a
practice
by
which
the
government,
being
in
a
position
to,
in
effect,
impoverish
a
defendant,
and
we're
dealing
here
with
a
defendant
who
had
only
two
assets.
he
had
his
home
in
mount
vernon,
and
he
had
a
cooperative
apartment.
and
by
terms
of
the
restraining
order
he
could
not
mortgage,
encumber,
or
do
anything
with
those
properties
by
which
to
raise
funds
in
order
to
hire
himself
an
attorney.
so,
we're
not
dealing
with
the
bank
robber
analogy
or
the
necessarily
contraband
asset
analogy.
an
individual
was,
in
effect,
deprived
totally
of
his
ability
not
to
hire
a
particular
lawyer,
but
any
lawyer
of
choice.
and
i
think
that
the
sixth
amendment
makes
very,
very
clear
that
the
fundamental
core
value
of
the
sixth
amendment
has
always
been
the
right
of
an
individual
to
select
counsel
of
his
choice
and
for
a
very
important
reason,
so
that
in
his
controversy
with
the
sovereign,
he
may
formulate
a
defense
as
he
chooses
that
defense
to
be
properly
mounted
in
order
to,
obviously,
maintain
the
autonomy
values
that
a
defendant
should
have
in
his
controversy
with
the
sovereign,
and
also
for
participatory
various
that
where
a
defendant
is,
in
effect,
hailed
into
court--
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
--absolutely
he
is
limited
in
those
financial
means,
but
he
may
not
necessarily
be
arbitrarily
limited
by
governmental
action
that
chooses
to
impoverish
him.
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
well,
but
that...
and
i
think
this
is
where
i
think
the
court
must
consider
what
the
nature
of
a
criminal
forfeiture
penalty
is
on
the
one
hand,
and
also
the
relation-back
doctrine.
the...
this
property...
while
the
relation-back
doctrine
may
be
a
legal
fiction,
it
states
that
the
property
vests
in
the
united
states
as
of
the
time
of
the
crime.
in
point
of
fact,
title
does
no
come
to
the
united
states
until
after,
a,
the
criminal
trial
at
which
there
has
been
(a)
a
verdict
of
conviction,
(b)
a
verdict
of
forfeiture,
and
(c)
the
litigating
of
third-party
claimants
who
may
claim
to
be
bona
fide
purchasers
of
third
parties
reasonably
without
cause
to
believe
that
these
assets
are
involved.
and
if
you
read
the
particular
statutory
provision...
and
it's
853(n)(7)...
it
states
that
it
is
not
until
those
proceedings
have
been
completed
that
"clear
title"...
and
it
uses
that
term...
finally
vests
in
the
united
states.
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
well
that's
a
question
that's
really
not
before
the
court.
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
well,
the
statute,
of
course,
views
it
in
terms
of
a
judgment
of
conviction
and
a
verdict
of
conviction
and
forfeiture,
and
so
that...
and
perhaps
an
argument
wight
be
made
that
perhaps
appellate
rights
might
be
viewed
in
a
somewhat
different
context,
although
as
a
constitutional
matter,
i
would
not
like
to
necessarily
bind
myself
to
a
conclusion
that
you
would
not
necessarily
on
your
direct
appeal
be
necessarily
bound
by
that.
but
that's
not
necessarily
what
we
necessarily
have
here.
we're
talking
about
in
the
pretrial
context,
however
we
right
decide
in
another
case,
that
once
full
due
process
has
been
provided
and
there
has
been
a
verdict
of
forfeiture
and
those
tunas
have
been
deemed
forfeited...
not
just
deemed,
but
found
forfeited
to
the
united
states,
the
court
might
rule
otherwise.
we're
dealing
here
in
a
situation
in
which
at
the
commencement
of
the
proceedings,
the
defendant
is
in
effect
pauperized
by
the
government
and
deprived
of
the
ability
to
hire
any
lawyer
to
represent
him.
and
it
is
on
that
kind
of
a
basis
that
the
right
to
counsel
of
choice
is
not
merely
limited
or
restricted;
it's
abrogated
and
abridged
completely.
it
no
longer
exists.
it
is
a
total
deprivation
of
the
right
to
counsel
of
choice.
now,
i
think
that
one
of
the
important
considerations
to
be
considered
here
in
considering
counsel
of
choice
is
what
are
the...
the
government's
interests
here
that
they
posit
against
this
application
of
the
statute
where
the
defendant's
constitutional
rights
are
concerned.
it's
our
belief
that
clearly
where
there
is
such
a
compelling
interest
for
the
defendant
to
having
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
of
choice
which,
as
i
say,
going
back
to
powell
v.
alabama
and
well
beyond,
even
to
the
time
of
the
framers,
a
core
value,
the
government
must
apply
a
strict
scrutiny
test
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
abridgment
may
be
permitted
because
we're
not
dealing
with
a
limit...
more
limited
restriction
on
right
to
counsel
of
choice,
like
time,
place
and
manner
where
perhaps
limited
or
lesser
scrutiny
might
apply.
we're
talking
about
a
total
deprivation
and
a
deprivation
for
all
time
throughout
the
proceedings.
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
there
is
within
the
statute
itself...
i
think
that
under
those
circumstances,
the
court
might
well
have
the
quitable
discretion.
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
well,
i
don't...
i...
i
think
that
there
is
certainly
a
lesser
constitutional
right
to...
to
a
doctor
necessarily
than
to
a
lawyer--
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
--well,
then
there
might...
then
there
might
be...
and
i
think
your
honor
has...
i
would
stand
corrected
that,
obviously,
where
there
may
be
a
taking
under
these
kinds
of
circumstances
that
would
affect
fifth
amendment
values,
the
court
might
well
under
those
kinds
of
circumstances
determine
on
an
individual
case
basis
the
nature
of
the
interest
that's
affected
by
the
deprivation
and
the
defendant's
interest
and
you
might
get
into,
as
i
say,
the
mathews
v.
eldridge
test.
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
well--
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
--well,
i
think
part
of
what
we
must
keep
in
mind
here
also--
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
--i
think
it
has--
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
--i
think
that
there
have
to
be
sufficiently
flexible
procedures
that
is
a...
that
is
to
be
applied,
and
that...
in
terms
of
deciding
matters
other
than
attorneys'
fees
and
counsel
fees.
we're
talking,
on
the
one
hand,
with
certain
core
sixth
amendment
constitutional
values,
on
one
hand,
and
other
serious
values,
nonetheless,
that
may
implicate
fifth
amendment
rights
nonetheless.
but
when
we're
talking
in
the
context
of
a
criminal
forfeiture
statute,
i
believe
that
you
basically
have
got
to
give
the
court,
the
district
court,
this
equitable
discretion
on
a
case-by-case
basis
applying
a...
whatever
balancing
test
may
be
appropriate,
you
know,
perhaps
a
matthews
v.
eldridge
type
of
test
about
considering
the...
the
necessity
of
the
interest
affected
and
then
quite
frankly
and
the...
the
necessity
of
harm
that
may
befall
either
of
the
parties
in
these
case.
i
certainly
am
not
going
to
suggest
that
there
is
a...
that
the
court
would
have
to
come
to
the
same
result
where
emergency
room
surgery
is
concerned
as
opposed
to
necessarily
going
on
a
round-the-world
cruise.
there
are
clearly
different
interests,
but
i
still
believe
that
the
district
courts
can
make
those
kinds
of
determinations,
given
the
authority
which
i
believe
that
they
must
have
under
the
fifth
amendment
to
make
those
kinds
of
due
process
determinations
of
appropriate
procedural
due
process.
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
well,
i
think
that
what
that
is
doing--
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
--well,
they
are
different--
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
--they're...
that's
correct.
what
i'm
saying
is
they
are
different
values
that
cannot
necessarily
be
lumped
together
and
collapsed
together.
the
right
to
counsel--
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
--absolute--
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
--exactly.
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
and
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
counsel
for
both
sides
agreed
for
the
convenience
of
the
court.
we
briefed
it.
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
i
apologize.
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
want
to
just
touch
briefly
on
this
question
of
the
kind
of
a
hearing
that
is...
that
is
entitled
here.
i
think
we
and
the
government
may
be
at
some
distinction
with
regard
to
the
kind
of
procedural
due
process
that
is,
in
fact,
due
and
that's,
in
fact,
deprived
to
the
defendant
with
regard
to
the
initial
pretrial
restraining
orders
that
are
involved.
i
think
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
suggest
that
this
matter
ought
to
be
remanded
to
congress
on
fifth
amendment
procedural
due
process
grounds
is
that
there's
a
clear
intent
stated
by
congress
in
distinguishing
between
the
section...
and
section
853(e)(1)(a)
and
(e)(1)(b)
meaning
post-indictment
restraints
and
pre-indictment
restraints
that
where
a
post-indictment
restraint
is
involved,
as
were
involved
here,
congress
explicitly
stated
and
the
senate
report
states...
and
this
is
noted
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
association
of
the
bar
at
page
14
where
they
enumerate
this
discussion...
that
"the
post-indictment
restraining
order
provision
does
not
require
prior
notice
and
opportunity
for
a
hearing.
"
and
it
said
that
one
of
the
reasons
was
that
several
courts
had
read
a
hearing
requirement
into
the
predecessor
statute
on
constitutional
grounds,
and
that
the
senate
report
stated
that
congress
intended
to
override
these
decisions.
so,
they
were,
in
fact,
specifically
attempting
to
do
away
with
the
right
of
a
defendant
to
have
a...
a
post-indictment
hearing.
and
i
think
it's
very
significant,
when
you
look
at
the
differing
protections
that
are
provided
in
a
pre-indictment
restraint
hearing
and
a
post-indictment
restraint
hearing,
because
one
of
the
factors
that
is
provided
in
the
post-indictment
restraint...
in
a
pre-indictment
restraint
nearing
is
a
balancing
of
the
equities
and
consideration
of
the
relevant
factors.
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
well,
because
of
the
fact
that
it
is
not
required...
and
as
he
noted
in
our
briefs,
and
particularly
citing
the
grammatikos
case,
that
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
grand
jury
in
its
return
of
an
indictment
enumerating
forfeiture
counts
find
probable
cause
or
even
consider
probable
cause.
it's
a...
deemed
merely
to
be
a
penalty
provision
not
a
substantive
element
of
the
crime.
and,
thus,
a
grand
jury
does
not
have
to
consider
forfeiture
elements.
equally
importantly,
contrary
to
what
mr.
bryson
says
with
regard
to
the
enumeration
of
assets
in
an
indictment...
and
this
is
very,
very
crucial.
if
you
see
the
rico
forfeiture
indictments
and
some
of
the
large
narcotic
type
of
indictments,
they
will
track
the
statutory
language
and
without
specifying
properties
in
question,
they
will
say
any
and
all
assets
that
maybe
part
of
the
fruits
or
instrumentalities
or
crimes
or
are
derived
from
and
simply
without
any
kind
of
specification,
tie
up
everything
they
can
find
anywhere
without
any
enumeration
to
the
defendant
or
to
potential
bona
fide
purchasers
as
to
what
those
assets
are.
they
basically
have
open
sesame.
and
in
most
of
the
large
rico
indictments,
that's
the
way
forfeiture
counts
are
now
framed.
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
well,
the...
the...
i
think
that
it
would...
that
it
might
be
perhaps
even
better
rather
than
to--
mr.
edward
m.
chikofsky
--well,
i
think
that
the
courts
seem
to
be
at
variance
with
the
government.
what's
most
important
here
is
that
clearly
congress
should
be
given
an
opportunity
to
redraft
a
hearing.
