you're
suggesting
that
perhaps
we
shouldn't...
we
shouldn't
just
take
the
words
congress
used
at
face
value.
is
that
it?
justice
white
--well,
you...
you
talk
as
though...
it's
true
that
counsel
of
one's
choice
is...
is
apparently
a
value
in
itself,
but
there
still
is
left
the
question
of
whether
this
regime
the
government
is
insisting
one
would
deprive
the
defendant
of
effective
counsel.
justice
white
now,
let's
say...
now,
i
take
it
that
you...
you're
not
making
any
submission
that...
that
under
the
government's
proposal
that
you
wouldn't
have
effective
counsel.
it's
just
that
you
don't
have
the
counsel
of
your
choice.
justice
white
isn't
that
right?
justice
white
i
just
wanted
to
make
it
clear--
justice
white
--clear
that
that's
what
you're
arguing.
justice
white
even
assuming
you
would
have
perfectly
adequate
counsel
under
the
government's
submission,
you...
this
is...
it's...
the...
the...
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
construed
by
the
government.
justice
white
and
by
the
way,
why
did
you
argue
first
in
this
case?
i
just--
--they
agreed
to.
justice
white
yes,
well,
i
just...
somehow
i
missed
that
agreement.
justice
white
it
may
be
that
the
rule
7
should
be
construed
to
require
the
specification
of
the
particular
asset.
justice
white
the
government
seems
to
say
that's...
that...
that
their
rule
requires
it.
