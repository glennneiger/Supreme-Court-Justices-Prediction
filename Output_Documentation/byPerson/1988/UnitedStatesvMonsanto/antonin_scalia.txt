justice
scalia
we
have
later
cases
after
catholic
bishops
that
say
that
you
don't
avoid
constitutional
questions
by
reading
a
statute
to
say
something
it
doesn't
say.
i
mean,
the...
the
object
of
avoiding
serious
constitutional
question
doesn't
give
us
a
charter
to
rewrite
statutes.
justice
scalia
and
there's
just
no
exception
here
for
attorneys'
fees.
justice
scalia
it
may
have
been
one
of
the
mistakes
that
the
chief
justice
was
referring
to.
and
maybe...
maybe
we
have
to
decide
whether
it
violates
the
sixth
amendment
or
not.
and
if
it
does,
then
it's
no
good;
and
if
it
doesn't,
then...
then
it's
harsh,
but
okay.
justice
scalia
but
you're
asking
us
to
sort
of
rewrite
the
statute--
justice
scalia
--do
you
have
a
case
where
we've
done
that?
justice
scalia
where
we
say
it
would
be
okay
if
congress
wanted
to
do
it,
but
we
don't
know
whether
they
really
wanted
to
do
it.
even
though
the
statute
on
its
face
seems
to
say
they
wanted
to
do
it,
they
have
to
say
it
more
explicitly.
do
you
know
of
one
case?
justice
scalia
it
will
certainly
make
our
life
lot
easier
up
here,
i
must
say.
whenever
we
have
a
really
tough
constitutional
question,
we
can
just
say,
well,
you
know,
maybe
it's
okay,
maybe
it
isn't.
but
at
least
it's
so
close
that
congress
ought
to
speak
more
explicitly.
kind
of
like
the
english
house
of
lords.
they
can
stall
something
for
one
year.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
we'd
use
legislative
history
to
decide
whether
they
seriously
co
considered
or
not.
rights?
i
mean,
we
would
look
in
the
committee
reports
and
the
floor
debates.
justice
scalia
and
if
they...
if
there
had
been
a
lot
of
that
discussion
there,
then
it's
okay.
but
if
there
hadn't
been,
then
we...
then
we--
justice
scalia
--send
it
back
to
congress.
does
congress
have
to
say
it
in
the
statute
the
next
time,
or
is
it
enough
if
they
discuss
it
in
the
floor
debate
and
the
committee
reports
and
then
send
the
same
statute
back
to
us,
but
now
they've
discussed
it
in
the
legislative
history?
then
it's
okay?
justice
scalia
what
about
medical
services?
what
about
funds
for
a
very
expensive
operation?
justice
scalia
i'm
talking
about
constitutional
right.
is
there
any
less
constitutional
right
to
that
than
to
a
lawyer?
justice
scalia
even
if
it
is
necessary
for
your
life?
i
thought
life,
liberty
and
property
were
pretty
clearly--
justice
scalia
--it
includes
property,
too...
life,
liberty
or
property.
what
if
i
say,
gee,
you
know,
you
take
away
this
money
and
i
won't
be
able
to
make
my
mortgage
payment
and
i'll
lose
my
house?
justice
scalia
so,
it's
a
deprivation
of
property
unless
you...
unless
you
let
me
keep
this
money.
justice
scalia
i'm
suggesting
a
where-does-it-all-end
argument.
i...
i
don't...
i
don't
see--
justice
scalia
--that
lawyer's
fees
are
something,
you
know--
justice
scalia
mr.
bryson,
could
i
ask
you
a
question
about
protective
orders?
why
do
you
need...
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
how
the
procedural
protections,
if
there
are
any,
apply.
you
really
don't
need
a
protective
order
at
all
to--
justice
scalia
--to
have
this
statute
work,
right,
i
mean,
especially
as
far
as
lawyers
are
concerned.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
right,
i
understand.
justice
scalia
you
follow
the
res.
right.
justice
scalia
i
understand.
right.
justice
scalia
but
suppose
you
don't...
you
don't
apply
for
a
protective
order.
how...
how
does
the
lawyer
get
any...
and
suppose
i
think
you
need
some
kind
of
due
process
before...
before
the
defendant's
right
to
get
counsel
can
be
cut
off.
how
would...
how
would
a
due
process
hearing
occur?
it
wouldn't
come
up
in
the
context
of
the
application
for
protective
order.
how...
how
otherwise
would
it
come
up?
justice
scalia
but
it...
but
it
really
is
the
case
that
as
soon
as
you
file
an
indictment,
whether
you
seek
a
protective
order
or
not,
and
therefore
whether
you
have
a...
some
kind
of
a
due
process
hearing
or
not,
effectively
this
fellow
can't
get
a
good
lawyer.
justice
scalia
well--
justice
scalia
--assuming
all
his
assets...
i
mean,
assuming
all
his
assets
are
covered
by
the--
justice
scalia
xxx
so,
and...
and
if
it
did,
you
would...
you
would
be
wise
simply
never
to
apply
for--
justice
scalia
--a
protective
order--
justice
scalia
--at
least
if
you
wanted
to
deprive--
justice
scalia
--your
opponent
of
counsel.
justice
scalia
because
you
don't
need
one
to
do
that
as
we--
justice
scalia
--as
we
discussed
earlier.
