chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
88-454,
united
states
against
monsanto.
mr.
chikofsky,
you
may...
mr.
chikofsky...
excuse
me...
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
when
you
say
realized,
you
don't
use
that
word
as
synonymous
with
intended,
do
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
congress
i'm
sure
enacts
many
laws
which
have
consequences
that
it
doesn't
realize.
i
mean,
we
see
them
here
all
the
time.
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
he's
limited
in
that
respect
by
his
financial
means.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
that
chooses
to
his
impoverish
him
by,
in
the
government's
view,
reclaiming
money
that
is
rightfully
the
government's
not
his
in
the
first
place.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
so,
under...
under
your
theory,
the...
the
defendant
in
a
case
like
yours
could
use
his
money
even
to
hire
counsel
on
appeal.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
i
mean,
you're
saying
until
the
procedure
has
been
completed.
does
that
mean
whatever
legal
proceedings
the
defendant
wants
to
engage
in
after
the
final
judgment
of
forfeiture
in
the
district
court
are
also
subject
to
this
proviso
that
you
are
talking
about?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
chikofsky.
mr.
bryson?
chief
justice
rehnquist
your
opponent
thinks
there
was
a
question
as
to
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
did
not
rule
on
the
procedural
due
process.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bryson.
mr.
chikofsky,
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
wouldn't
it
be
reasonable
to...
for
congress
to
say
that
where
post-indictment,
you
have
a
finding
of
probable
cause
by
a
grand
jury,
and
before
that
you
don't?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
your
mr.
chikofsky.
the
case
is
submitted.
