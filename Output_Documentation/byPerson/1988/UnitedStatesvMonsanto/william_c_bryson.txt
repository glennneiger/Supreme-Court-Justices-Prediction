mr.
william
c.
bryson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
first
point
i'd
like
to
make,
and
i
think
something
that
has
been
touched
on
in
the
course
of
the
hour
and
a
half
that
we've
discussed
the
case
so
far,
is...
is
at
the
risk
of
oversimplifying
our
position
in
addressing
this
question
of
the
medical
services
or
the
attorney
services,
this...
this
notion
that
the
court
ought
to
be
in
a
position
to
decide
whether
the
defendant
or
the
government
ought
to
be
able
to
spend
the
money
is
in
this
context
a
very
strange
one.
now,
mr.
chikofsky
suggests
that
a
court
ought
to
have
the
equity...
equitable
power
to
decide
that
the
defendant
needs
the
money
more
than
the
government
was
essentially
his
submission.
this
is
the
government's
money,
as
congress
has
declared
it
to
be,
just
as
a
court
could
not
decide
that
mr.
chikofsky
needs
an
operation
and
i'm
going
to
waste
the
money
on
an
around-the-world
trip
and
take
my
money
and
give
it
to
mr.
chikofsky,
by
the
same
token
the
court
cannot
say,
we
submit,
under
either
the
constitution
or
the
statute,
that
mr.
chikofsky's
client
needs
a
better
lawyer
than
he
would
get
by
appointment,
and
he
needs
a
better
lawyer
more
than
the
government
needs
to
keep
the
money
that
is
the
government's
money.
so,
our
basic
position
is
once
we
decide
that
this
is
the
government's
money,
you
don't
look
to
the
balancing
of
hardships
between
the
two
parties.
you
simply
decide
this
is
the
government's
money.
that's
the
end
of
the
question.
now,
with
respect
to
the
statute,
let
move
first
since
we...
we
didn't
spend
very
much
time
on
the
statute
during
the
last
hour
and
address
the...
the
points
that
mr.
chikofsky
makes
and
the
argument
also
that
is
made
by
adoption
by
mr.
chikofsky,
but
principally
by
caplin
&
drysdale,
as
to
the
construction
of
the
statute.
first,
it
is...
the
statute
is
very
clear
and
very
broad.
it
applies
to
all
property
that
satisfies
one
of
the
three
definitions
in
section
853(a).
all
of
that
property
shall
be...
is
forfeited
to
the
government.
the...
that
property
clearly
includes
money
that
a
defendant
may
wish
to
use
for
a
variety
of
purposes
including
attorneys'
fees.
now,
there
is
no
exception
or
no
suggestion
of
an
exception
in
the
statute
for
attorneys'
fees
or
money
that
the
defendant
wishes
to
use
for
attorneys'
fees
and,
in
fact,
the
reliance
on
the
legislative
history
gives
no
support
at
all
to
the
suggestion
that
there
ought
to
be
some
kind
of
implicit
exception
for
attorneys'
fees.
the
one
reference
in
the
legislative
history
that
the...
monsanto
and
caplin
&
drysdale
rely
on
is
a
reference
in
a
house
report
which
was
reporting
a
bill,
which
was
different
in
significant
measure
from
the
one
that
was
ultimately
passed,
in
which
the
house
said
that
it
was
not
resolving
the
conflict
among
the
district
courts
about
the
question
of
whether
the
sixth
amendment
was
implicated
by
the
forfeiture
of
the
assets
of
a
defendant,
and
in
which
the
house
went
on
to
say
that
the
statute
should
not
be
applied
in
a
way
that
would
violate
the
sixth
amendment.
now,
that
in
our
view
not
only
does
not
support
the
view
that
there's
an
implicit
exception
for
attorneys'
fees.
it
merely
says
that
the
statute
should
not
be
read
in
a
way
that
violates
the
sixth
amendment
and,
therefore,
as
we...
since
we
view
the
statute
as
operating
consistently
with
the
sixth
amendment,
particularly
if
appropriate
procedures
are
employed,
that
there
is
no
express
or
implied
exception
for
attorneys'
fees.
that
position
is...
is
reinforced
by
language
in
the
senate
report...
and
the
senate
report
was
reporting
on
the
bill
that
was
ultimately
passed,
almost
exactly
the
bill
that
was
passed...
in
which
the
senate
discusses
the
long
case
which
was
the
third
circuit
case
that
preceded
this
statute
and
in
which
the...
the
court
in
that
case
authorized
the
forfeiture
of
funds
which
were
in
the...
property
that
was
in
the
hands
of
attorneys
which
were
designed
for
the
payment
of
attorneys'
fees.
now,
the
defendants
have...
monsanto
has
attempted
to
distinguish
the
long
case
and
the
reliance
of
the...
of
the
senate
on
the
long
case
on
the
ground
that
that
was
a
sham
transfer.
but,
in
fact,
if
you
read
the
long
case,
there
is
nothing
in
long
that
suggests
in
any
way
that
it
was
a
sham
transfer.
that
was
simply
a
transfer
of
property
to...
to
a
lawyer,
which
was
designed
for
all
that
appears
on
the...
in
the
opinion
to
compensate
the
lawyer
for
legal
fees,
for
legal
services.
the
court
upheld
the
forfeiture.
the
senate
report
relies
on
long,
among
other
authorities,
as
supporting
the
relation
back
doctrine,
and
it
suggests
very
strongly
in
our
view
that
attorneys'
fees
were
not
intended
to
be
given
some
kind
of
special
treatment
or
exception.
now,
the
other
legislative
history
point
that
is
made
by
the
parties
and
amici
in
this
case
is
that
there
is...
there
are
indications
in
the
legislative
history
that
the
statute
was
really
only
intended
to
apply
to
sham
or
fraud
transfers
and
were
not...
was
not
intended
to
apply
to
transfers
that
did
not
constitute
shams.
and
our
response
to
this...
and
we've
discussed
this
at
some
length
in
our
brief...
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
suggests
a
specific
intent
to
limit
the
forfeitability
to
those
categories.
in
fact,
what
the
senate
report
states
is
in
the
one
footnote
that
is
most
heavily
relied
on
by
the
other
side,
that
"provisions...
this
provision
should
be
construed
to
deny
relief
to
third
parties
acting
as
nominees
or
knowingly
engaged
in
sham
or
fraudulent
transactions.
"
that
does
not
suggest
that
that
is
the
only
way
that
the
statute
should
be
applied.
it...
it
includes
that
kind
of
person.
it
also
includes
people
who
are
engaged
in
transactions
that
are
not
shams,
as
long
as
they
satisfy
the
terms
of
the
statute.
now,
the--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
i
suspect
as
far
as
lawyers
are
concerned,
that's
probably
true,
although
not
necessarily
so.
and
here
i
have
to
get
into
another
area
in
which
the
law
is
not
entirely
well
settled.
but
let
me
suggest
this
scenario,
and
this
is
why
we
think
we
need
protective
orders.
the...
suppose
that
we
don't
apply
for
a
protective
order
and
money
is
paid
to
a
lawyer.
the
lawyer
then
immediately
dissipates
the
assets
by
paying
them
to
parties
who
are--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--bona
fide
purchasers
for
value.
the
money
may
very...
this
isn't
certain,
and
i
wouldn't
want
to
concede
this
for
sure
for
purposes
of
future
cases.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
but
it
appears
from
reading
the
statute
frankly...
the
money
is
gone.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that...
that
it's
gone.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
and
we
can't
get
it
from
the
lawyer.
we
can
under
the
substitute
assets
provision,
section
853(p),
go
back
to
the
defendant
but,
of
course,
if
he
doesn't
have
substitute
assets
to
compensate
for
that,
we
are
probably
stuck.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
there...
i
know
of
no
case
in
which
that
situation
has
arisen
because
we
almost
invariably
apply
for
and
obtain
protective
orders
in
this
setting.
so,
it's...
it's
not
something
that...
it
could
come
up
theoretically
but
simply,
as
a
practical
matter,
has
not
arisen.
but
i
suppose
that
if
a
court
were
troubled
by...
by
the
prospect
of
going
all
the
way
to
final
judgment
before
the...
the
government's
right
to...
to
ultimate
forfeiture
were
established
beyond
the
probable
cause
established
in
the
indictment,
which
we
believe
is
sufficient...
but
in...
in
any
event,
if
a
court
were
troubled
by
that,
the
court
could
have
a...
could
simply
hold
a
hearing
to
try
to
determine
the
likely
forfeitability
of
the
property--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--i...
i
think
that
is
not
necessarily
so.
there
are
several--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--things
that
have
to
happen.
i
mean,
it
may
be
well
be
that
someone
will
be
in
that
position.
indeed,
mr.
monsanto
was
in
a
position
that
he
could
not--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
there
are...
that's
right.
and...
and
in
this
case,
although
mr.
chikofsky
said
mr.
monsanto
only
had
two
assets,
while
this
has
not
been
established,
i
think
it's
very
doubtful
that
the
only
the
assets
in
the
world
that
this
man
had
were
two
pieces
of
real
property.
i
mean,
he
obviously
had
some
other
funds.
he
had
$35,000
in
cash
which
was
seized,
but
he
obviously
had
some
other
assets.
how
extensive
they
were
we
don't
know.
so,
this
is
a
case
in
which
it
may
very
well
be
that
he
could
have
hired
an
attorney
with
other
assets
of
which
we
are
unaware.
and
that
is
not
an
uncommon
situation.
one
of
the
purposes
of
the...
of
the
statute
is
to
avoid
putting
us
in
a
position
that
the
defendants
will
be
spending
the
tainted
funds
first
in
order
to
avoid
spending
funds
that
are,
in
fact,
unknown
to
the
government,
but
are
other
assets.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
if
they
were
products
of
crime,
we
could...
we
could
either
supersede...
we
could
file
a
superseding
indictment
naming
those
specific
assets.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes,
rule
7
of
the...
of
the
federal--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--the
property,
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes,
that's
right.
so,
it
would
have
to
be
included
in
the
indictment.
and
it
could
be
the
subject
of
a
separate
civil
forfeiture,
as
you
say.
but
assuming
that
he
has
other
assets,
and
assuming
that
those
assets
are
untainted,
it's
our
position
that
it
will
very
often
be
the
case
that
he
will
be
able
to
hire
a
lawyer,
and
he
simply
won't
be
able
to
use
the
tainted
assets.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
only
if
they
are
named
in
the
indictment.
only
if
the
assets
are
named
in
the
indictment.
they...
the
court,
in
other
words--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--no,
but
rule
7
and
rule
31
together
have
the
effect
of
saying
that
you...
the
forfeiture
that's
entered
in
the
criminal
case
is
limited
to
those
properties
that
are
alleged
in
the
indictment.
now,
the...
but
in
any
event,
i
think
it's...
it's
significant
to
note--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
the...
the...
it's
significant
i
think
to
point
out
that
a
number
of
things
have
to
happen
in
other
words
for
somebody
to
be
denied
their
right
to
counsel.
there
have
to
be...
has
to
be...
their
right
to
counsel
of
choice.
there
has
to
be
no
other
provision,
no
other
way,
that
they
counsel
can
be
hired
by,
for
example,
the
defendant's
relatives
or
other
assets.
the
situation
has
to
be
such
that
the
counsel
is
unwilling
to...
to
work
for
criminal
justice
act
fees
and
it
has
to
be
a
situation,
frankly,
in
which
the
counsel...
it's
clear
that
the
counsel
otherwise
would
have
taken
the
case,
which...
which
many
counsel
would--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--no,
your
honor.
we...
we
believe
that
our
position
is--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--entirely
consistent
with
the
counsel
of
choice
provision,
the...
the
construction
of
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
your
honor,
there's
no
question
that
this
is
in
some
cases
going
to
mean
the
difference
between
getting
counsel
of
choice
and
ending
up
with
an
appointed
counsel.
there
have
been
i
think
a
total
of
four
cases
that
i
have
been
able
to
find
in
which
that
has
happened.
it
doesn't
happen
every
day.
now,
admittedly
this
is
in
part
because
the
constitutionally
of
this
provision
has
been
under...
under
question,
but
nonetheless
this
is
not
something
in
which
we
have
hundreds
and
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
cases.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
the...
nobody
is
going
to
be
put
in
a
position
of
having
to
work
for
nothing.
the
question
is
do
you
either
get
counsel
for
whatever
fees
that
you
and
counsel
agree
on,
payable
out
of
what
we
believe
are
government
assets,
or
do
you
get
a--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--lawyer
who
is
working
for
cja
funds.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
not
any
more
than
we
take
over
the
defense
of
any
defendant
who
is
represented
by
appointed
counsel.
and
i
have
had
enough
cases
against
very
able
appointed
counsel
and
public
defenders
that--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
that's
right,
and...
and
i
think...
i
think
that
very
often
those
people
do
very
fine
work.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
have
not,
no.
no.
and
i...
i
understand
the
difficulties,
your
honor.
it
is
not
an
enviable
position
to
be
in.
our
only
point
is
that
someone
who
is
in
that
position
has
a
right
to
exercise
a...
a...
his
freedom
of
obtaining
counsel
of
choice,
but
not
by
using
somebody
else's
money.
and
here
it's...
the
defendant
is
asking
to
be
allowed
to
use
money
that
has
been
determined
to
be
the
government's.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
your
honor--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--i
am
sure
that...
that
this
is
a
drop
in
the
bucket,
but
it
is
a--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--i
don't
know
what
the
total
amount
of
forfeitures
is.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
it
is
millions.
oh,
it's
many
millions.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
many
millions
in
forfeitures,
oh
yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
can't
tell
you
the
exact
figure,
but
i
know
it's
many
millions.
whether
it's...
it's
in
the
billions
or
not,
i...
i'm
not
sure,
but
it's
many
millions
of
dollars--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
that's
true.
that's
true.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
we
are
going
to
solve
the
national
debt
problem,
particularly
with
the
feature
of
this
case
that's
presented
with
respect
to
attorneys'
fees.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
we
don't,
no,
your
honor.
in
fact,
the--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--not
i
don't
think
it
is,
your
honor.
the...
i
mean,
when
i
say
we
don't
challenge
it,
we
have
laid
out
in
our
brief
what
we
think
the
proper
way
to
analyze
the
procedural
due
process
question
is
if
the
court
decides
to
look
at
that
question.
but...
and
i
would
emphasize...
we
don't
think
that
is
presented
here
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
en
banc
court,
the
second
circuit,
held
that
these
fees...
that
these
funds
are
not
forfeitable
no
matter
what
the
validity
of
the
hearing
that
was
held.
in
other
words,
they
went
off
purely
on
the
substantive
question.
they
did
not
address
the
question
of
whether
that
was
an
adequate
hearing.
they
said
that
regardless
of
how
good
a
hearing
was
held,
this...
these
funds
are
exempt
by
operation
of
the
statute
and
by
operation
of
the
constitution,
three
judges
on
each
point,
from
forfeiture.
and
that's
the...
the
issue
that
we
took
to
this
court
in
our
petition
for
certiorari.
the...
if
there
is
any
question
as
to
the
validity
of
the
hearing...
and
we
certainly
think
there
is
not.
this
was
an
extremely
extensive
hearing.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
he
does,
and
he
can
present,
that
question.
assuming
this
court
reverses
the
en
banc
second
circuit,
he
can
present
that
on
that
remand.
and
if
he's
right
and
if
he
persuades
the
second
circuit
that
that
hearing
was
somehow
flawed,
then
he
may
well
get
some
kind
of
remedy.
but
in
our
view,
that
question
is
not
presented
here
because
of
what
the
second
circuit
on
banc
did,
and
that
is
to
rule
purely
on
the
substantive
question
saying
no
forfeiture
of
attorney...
funds
to
be
used--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--and
it
did
not
address
the
procedural
question,
not
the
on
banc
court.
that's
right.
now,
there's
one
other
point
which
i
would...
would
like
to
touch
on
is...
that
is
the...
the...
the
statutory
theory
employed
by
caplin
&
drysdale.
this
is
the
judge
winter...
it's
judge
winter
of
the
second
circuit,
not
judge
winter
of
the
third...
of
the
fourth
circuit.
but
the
statutory
argument
that
is
made
by
caplin
&
drysdale
and
adopted
by
monsanto,
and
that
is
the
reliance
on
the
restraining
order
provision
and
section
853(c).
very
briefly,
our
point
on
that
is
this.
they
argue
that
section
853(e),
the
restraining
order
provision,
gives
discretion
to
a
district
court
to
exclude
certain
funds
from
the
restraining
order;
and,
two,
that
a
court
must
exclude
from
the
restraining
order
certain
property,
including
that
property
that
is
necessary
for
attorney's
fees
and
ordinary
living
expenses;
and,
three,
that
the
court
then
must
exclude
from
the
final
order
of
forfeiture
all
property
that
was
excluded
from
the
restraining
order.
now,
we
agree
with
one
and
disagree
sharply
with
two
and
three.
there
is
no
question
that
the
district
court
has
discretion
at
the
restraining
order
stage
to
modify,
vacate,
amend,
do
whatever
it
wants
with
the
restraining
order.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
your
honor,
i
think
what
it
does
is...
and...
and
the...
you
have
to
look
at
the
purpose
underlying
the
restraining
order
provision
as...
as
indicated,
both
in
the
statute
and
in
the
legislative
history.
the
purpose
was
to
preserve...
and
as...
as
the
legislative
history
indicates,
the
sole
purpose
was
to
preserve
assets
for
potential
forfeiture.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
your
honor,
the...
no
is
our...
is
the
short
answer
to
that.
what
the
district
court
has
the
discretion
to
do
is
to
grant
or
deny
relief
depending
on
the
district
court's
assessment
of
the
risk
that
that...
those
funds
will
be
gone
if
the
restraining
order
is
not
granted.
in
other
words,
if
there
is,
let's
say,
a
bond
or
something
that
insures
that
the
funds
will
not
be
dissipated,
then
the
district
court
could
well
exercise
discretion
and
say
no
restraining
order
is
necessary
here.
these
funds
aren't
going
anywhere,
this
property
is
not
going
anywhere.
or
if
for
some
other
reason--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
so,
it
wouldn't
have
to
be--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
i
think
there
may
be
other
situations
where
the
court
may
not
want
to
grant
a
restraining
order.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
the...
in
the
caplin
&
drysdale
casein
for
example,
caplin
&
drysdale
took
the
$25,000
check
and
put
it
an
escrow
account.
now,
i
can
understand
a
court
saying...
suppose
that
were
the
only
asset
that
was
in
question.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
could
understand
a
court
saying
caplin
&
drysdale
is
a
reputable
firm,
they
aren't
going
to
spend
these
monies.
they've
told
me
that
they're
going
to
leave
it
in
the
escrow
account.
there's
no
need
for
a
restraining
order
here.
that's
the
only
asset
in
issue.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes,
and
the
reason
is
this,
and
this
is
the
crux
of
our
disagreement
with
points
two
and
point
three
of...
of
the
argument.
the
reason
that
that
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
is
because
that
has
nothing
to
co
with
the
question
of
preserving
the
funds
for
ultimate
forfeiture.
that
goes
to
invading
the
corpus
of
the
ultimate
forfeited
funds,
and
there
is
what...
if
there's
anything
that's
clear
about
section
e,
it
is
that
it
does
not
authorize
the...
the
judge
to
essentially
give
partial
summary
judgment
through
an
injunction
or
denial
of
an
injunction
with
respect
to
the
funds
that
will
ultimately
be
subject
to
forfeiture.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
exactly
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
and
section
c,
as
we
view
it,
simply
does...
does
nothing
to
altar
that
regime.
section
c
simply
provides
that
property
which
is
subject
to
mandatory
forfeiture
as
defined
in
section
a,
853(a),
is
also
subject
to
mandatory
forfeiture
when
it
is
in...
is
in
the
hands
of
third
parties
under
the
relation-back
doctrine.
and
the
defendants
rely
on
a
line
from
section
c
in
which
it
is
stated
that
that
property
in
the
hands
of
a
third
party
"may
be
subject
to
a
special
verdict
of
forfeiture.
"
and
they
say,
aha,
the
word
may
appears.
therefore,
that
must
mean
discretion.
therefore,
that
must
mean
discretion
that
can
be
used
to
invade
the
corpus
of
the
forfeited
funds.
in
fact,
it's...
it's
clear
from
reading
both
the...
the
statute
in
context
and
the
legislative
history
that
that
may
was
not
intended
to
give
a
court
authority
to
exclude
from
the
final
order
of
forfeiture
any
funds
that
the
court
might
think
should
not
be
included
in
the
forfeited
assets,
whether
they
be
for
purposes
of
attorneys'
fees
or
an
operation
or
any
other
use.
the
authorization
there
is
simply
for
the
jury
and
the
prosecutor
to
seek
a
special
verdict
of
forfeiture
if
the
circumstances
seem
appropriate
and
if
the
jury
is
convinced
that
forfeiture
is...
is
correct.
and,
in
fact,
the
next
sentence
of
the
statute
says
that
any
property
that
is
found
to
be
forfeited
by
the
jury
in
the
special
verdict
of
forfeiture
must
or
shall
be
ordered
forfeited.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
have
nothing.
