justice
o'connor
mr.
chikofsky,
suppose
we
think
congress
did
make
it
clear
here
that
all
property
was
subject
to
forfeiture,
including
that
which
could
be
used
for
attorneys'
fees
and
food
and
other
necessities.
justice
o'connor
okay.
justice
o'connor
do
you...
do
you
concede
that
in
your
case
there
is
no
fifth
amendment
due
process
problem?
justice
o'connor
why
not?
you've
got...
the
defendant
received
a
hearing
in
this
case,
did
he
not?
justice
o'connor
the
case
is
still
pretrial.
justice
o'connor
not.
justice
o'connor
okay.
justice
o'connor
and
then
you
went
back
to
district
court?
justice
o'connor
and
then
it
was
sent
back
to
the
district
court.
justice
o'connor
now,
although
the
federal
government
applied
to
us
for
certiorari
you
filed
the
opening
brief
and
are
making
the
first
argument.
justice
o'connor
and
that's
because
of
the
remand
and
what
happened
at
trial?
justice
o'connor
by
agreement?
justice
o'connor
i
see.
justice
o'connor
and
it
has
to
identify
the
assets?
justice
o'connor
well,
it
isn't
all
that
clear
to
me
what
the
section
means.
maybe
it
just
limits
the
district
court
to
the
three
options
set
forth.
justice
o'connor
well,
does
the
district
court
have
discretion
to
permit
the
money
to
be
used
for
attorneys'
fees?
justice
o'connor
well,
a
bond
is
one
of
the
opt
ions--
justice
o'connor
--given
in
the
statute.
justice
o'connor
that's
what
i
suggested
that
maybe
the...
the
court's
discretion
is
limited
to
the
three
options
in
the
statute.
justice
o'connor
like
what?
justice
o'connor
uh-huh.
justice
o'connor
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
if
the
trial
court
were
to
say
i'm
just
going
to
deny
this
and
let
him
use
the
money--
justice
o'connor
--for
an
operation
or
attorneys'
fees
or
what
have
you?
