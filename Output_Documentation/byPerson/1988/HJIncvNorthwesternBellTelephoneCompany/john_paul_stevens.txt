but
may
i
ask
you,
if
there
were
two,
a
series
of
bribes
and
a
rate
increase,
another
series
of
bribes
and
a
second
rate
increase,
if
that
would
satisfy
your
test?
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
just
possible;
that
would
clearly
come
within
it
under
your
explanation
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
why...
you
say
it's
a
minimum
of
three?
