why
is
it
that
we
require
continuity,
in
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
not
the
reason
that
the
concern
of
the
statute
is
to
prohibit
activities
that
have
an
ongoing
potential
threat?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
isn't
the
ninth...
the
eighth
circuit's
scheme
at
least
consistent
with
that?
it's
not
inconsistent
with
that,
is
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it's
consistent
with
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there
certain
crimes
that
are
more
susceptible
of
an
inference
of
continuity
and
ongoing
threat
than
others?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
say,
extortion,
blackmail,
drug
dealing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
sure.
when
we're
talking
about
pattern,
would
it
be
feasible,
do
you
think,
for
this
court
to
say
that
you
have
to
show
for
a
rico
civil
act
that
the
criminal
activity
has
a
threat
of
ongoing
harm?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
where
you
are,
i
take
it,
is
that
you
concede
or
you
propose
that
there
has
to
be
under
the
statute
by
its
own
terms
the
existence
of
repeated
criminal
activity,
not
just
repeated
acts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
the
statute
uses
the
terms
differently.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
doesn't
the
eighth
circuit
two-scheme
rule
run
headlong
into
1962
subpart
(b)
which
says
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
through
a
pattern
of
racketeering
to
acquire
any
interest
in
the
control
of
an
enterprise?
that
sounds
to
me
like
one
scheme,
and
it's
right
there
in
the
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
may
be,
and
your
example
happens
to
fit
the
two-scheme
rationale,
but
that
doesn't
answer
the
question
that
the
two-scheme
rationale
doesn't
fit
the
statute.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
agree
with
you
that
in
the
hypothetical
you
pose
there
should
be
no
liability,
we
need
something
other
than
the
two-scheme
rationale
to
do
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
how
does
that
fit
the
two-scheme
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
you're
defending.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
that
four
or
five
members
of
the
costa
nostra
take
over
a
very
legitimate
company
and
over
three
or
four
years
engage
in
a
series
of
acts
of
bribes
to
achieve
one
rate
increase.
i
submit
that
that's
precisely
what
congress
sought
to
avoid.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
doesn't
fit
your
test.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
would
this
case...
this
case
wouldn't
turn
out
any
differently
if
we
held
there
had
to
be
continuity
with
reference
to
the
criminal
enterprise,
would
it?
