mr.
john
d.
french
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
in
order
for
this
argument
to
make
any
sense,
it
has
to
be
put
into
a
context,
and
i
think
the
context
is
this
court's
decision
in
sedima
v.
imrex.
i
know
there
are
three
opinions
written
in
that
case,
and
the
three
opinions
come
to
quite
different
conclusions
about
the
issues
of
the
case,
but
there
is
a
single
theme
running
through
all
three
opinions,
and
that
is
concern
about
the
disquieting
problem
that
civil
rico
is
running
far
beyond
the
intent
of
the
congress
to
attack
organized
crime
and
to
prevent
its
infiltration
into
legitimate
business.
justice
powell
in
his
opinion
observed
that
if
congress
had
intended
to
provide
a
federal
forum
for
plaintiffs
for
so
many
common
law
wrongs,
it
would
at
least
have
discussed
it.
justice
marshall's
dissenting
opinion
for
himself
and
justices
brennan,
blackmun
and
powell,
observed
that
in
criminal
application,
prosecutorial
discretion
has
had
a
desirable
restraining
influence
in
bringing
rico
actions,
but
in
the
civil
application,
that
desirable
restraining
influence
is
absent,
and
indeed,
the
reverse
is
true,
the
lure
of
treble
damages
and
reasonable
attorneys'
fees
is
bringing
about
a
situation
in
which
we
are
on
the
verge
of
federalizing
what
has
heretofore
been
state
criminal
and
state
common
law
problem.
justice
white's
opinion
for
the
court
expressly
raised
the
need
for
imposing
reasonable
limits
on
the
scope
of
rico
by
reference
to
the
definition
of
pattern
of
racketeering
activity.
in
what
has
now
become
certainly
one
of
the
most
celebrated
footnotes
in
recent
judicial
history,
footnote
14,
justice
white
pointed
out
that
a
pattern--
mr.
john
d.
french
--justice
white
for
the
court
pointed
out
that
a
pattern
requires
at
least
two
acts
of
racketeering
activity
but
does
not
mean
two
acts,
and
also
that
there
are
two
factors,
continuity
and
relationship,
that
have
to
combine
to
produce
a
pattern.
in
a
somewhat
less
celebrated
footnote,
footnote
10,
that
i
think
is
important
here,
the
court
also
observed
that
while
the
remedial
provisions
of
section
1964
of
the
statute
may
be
liberally
construed,
at
the
same
time
the
substantive
provisions
of
1961
and
<nineteen
sixty-two>
[=
1962]
may
legitimately
be
strictly
construed.
the
opinion
for
the
court
observed
that
we
have
come
to
a
point
in
which
private
civil
rico
actions
are
being
brought
almost
solely
against
legitimate
businesses
rather
than
organized
crime
operations,
and
it
concluded
this
way.
we
nonetheless
recognize
that
in
its
private,
civil
version,
rico
is
evolving
into
something
quite
different
from
the
original
conception
of
its
enactors.
the
extraordinary
wishes...
pardon
me...
the
extraordinary
uses
to
which
civil
rico
has
been
put
appear
to
be
primarily
the
result
of
the
breadth
of
the
predicate
offenses,
in
particular,
the
inclusion
of
wire,
mail
and
securities
fraud,
and
the--
mr.
john
d.
french
--i
think
there's
a
serious
problem
with
it,
your
honor,
but
i
can't
do
anything
about
that
here.
the
remainder,
the
remainder
of
the
court's
remarks
relate
to
something
that
i
think
can
be
dealt
with
here,
and
that
is
the
failure
of
the
courts
to
develop
a
meaningful
concept
of
pattern.
now,
that
is
what
has
happened.
following
sedima,
the
courts
have
tried,
most
of
the
courts
have
tried
to
react
to
the
opinions,
all
three
opinions
written
in
sedima,
and
what
they
have
done
is
take
the
invitation
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
try
to
develop
a
meaningful
concept
of
pattern.
as
footnote
14
remarks,
in
common
parlance,
two
of
anything
do
not
generally
form
a
pattern.
reaction
to
footnote
14
in
sedima
and
the
text
of
sedima
is
plainly
what
led
the
eighth
circuit
to
the
test
that
it
is
now
using.
the
eighth
circuit
has
said
that
on
three
or
four
occasions,
including
in
this
particular
case,
and
the
test
that
the
eighth
circuit
has
adopted
is
that
in
order
to
deal
with
both
relationship
and
continuity,
which
have
to
mean
two
separate
things
or
you
wouldn't
use
two
separate
words,
there
has
to
be
evidence
or
allegations
that
the
defendant
has
engaged
in
like
activities
in
the
past
or
other
criminal
activities
elsewhere.
i
think
this
is
a
reasonable
attempt
to
fathom
what
rico,
particularly
in
the
light
of
sedima.
mr.
john
d.
french
i
am,
your
honor,
and
i
will
do
that
now.
let
me
divide
your
question
in
half,
if
i
may,
justice
o'connor.
contrary
to
the
argument
put
forward
by
the
petitioners,
the
eighth
circuit
is
not
alone.
the
tenth
circuit
and
the
fourth
circuits
each
expressly
use
the
word
"schemes".
also,
even
though
the
second
and
seventh
circuits
do
not
use
the
word
"schemes",
in
their
recent
decisions
they
are
using
reasoning
and
reaching
results
comparable
to
the
eighth
circuit.
so
the
eighth
circuit
is
not
off
on
a
frolic
of
its
own,
and
it
is
not
true
that
this
case
would
have
been
decided
differently
in
any
other
circuit
in
america.
mr.
john
d.
french
i
think,
your
honor,
that
they
would
not.
the
seventh
circuit
talks
about
continuity
plus
relationship
and
talks
about
the
predicate
acts...
i'm
reading
from
page
26
of
respondents'
brief,
your
honor,
and
i'm
reading
from
medical
emergency
service
associates
v.
foulke,
which
we
quote...
"in
order
for
the
predicate
acts
to
be
sufficiently
continuous
to
amount
to
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity,
the
predicate
acts
must
be
ongoing
over
an
identified
period
of
time
so
that
they
can
fairly
be
viewed
as
constituting
separate
transactions,
i.e.,
transactions
somewhat
separated
by
time
and
place.
"
and
i
believe
"transaction",
as
used
by
that
court,
is
the
same
as
"scheme"
in
the
eighth
circuit
or
"episode"
as
used
by
some
other
court.
i
agree
with
mr.
reinhardt
that
we
oughtn't
to
get
bogged
down
in
the
semantics
of
the
particular
word,
but
separate
in
time
and
separate
in
space
seems
to
be
what
most
of
the
circuits
are
trying
to
comprehend
here.
mr.
john
d.
french
i
keep
reading
commentators
saying
that,
your
honor,
but
i
disagree,
and
i
think
it's
wrong.
i
think
it's
wrong
for
two
reasons.
let
me
take
an
example,
your
honor.
here
i
am,
john
french,
age
55,
no
prior
criminal
record.
i
decide
instead
of
continuing
to
practice
law
as
i
have
been
in
minneapolis,
i
see
an
opportunity
to
steal
money
from
a
client
or
to
take
over
a
business.
i
commit
one
act
of
mail
fraud,
one
act
of
wire
fraud,
one
act
of
securities
fraud,
and
i
have
accomplished
my
objective.
i
then
retreat
once
again
into
the
quiet
practice
of
law
in
minneapolis.
i
don't
believe
that
the
congress
meant
to
get
at
me
with
rico
if
that's
all
i've
done.
i
mean,
after
all,
i
can
be
prosecuted
under
the
mail
fraud
statute,
under
the
wire
fraud
statute,
under
the
securities
fraud
statute,
and
the
person
whom
i
have
cheated
can
sue
me
civilly
for
fraud
and
for
unjust
enrichment.
mr.
john
d.
french
well,
i
don't
think
you
do,
your
honor.
i
can
continue
my
hypothetical.
supposed
instead
of
sitting
back
happily
with
my
ill-gotten
gains
and
resuming
honest
activity
in
minneapolis,
i
say
that
worked
pretty
well.
i'm
going
to
try
it
again.
and
i
do.
i'm
going
to
try
it
again,
and
i
do.
i
have
now
committed
three
separate
clusters
of
illegal
activities,
and
i
believe
i
can
be
prosecuted
for
all
three,
going
all
the
way
back
to
the
first
one,
because
it
is
now
evident
that
it
is
part
of
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity.
moreover,
your
honor,
i
think
if
i
can
deal
with
your
specific,
if
you're
still
concerned
about
that
one
opportunity
that
i
took
to
commit
illegal
acts,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
i
could
do
it
with
one
act
of
mail
fraud,
one
of
wire
fraud
and
one
of
securities
fraud,
it's
not
under
rico
for
the
reasons
i
stated.
but
if
i
have
to
get
complicated
about
it,
if
i
have
to
commit
an
illegal
set
of
acts
in
nebraska
and
another
set
of
illegal
acts
in
iowa
and
another
set
of
illegal
acts
in
minnesota,
all
of
which
have
to
come
together
in
order
to
produce
the
illegal
result,
i
may
very
well,
as
this
court
might
conclude,
have
engaged
in
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity.
but
there
has
to
be
some
way--
mr.
john
d.
french
--well,
i
think
it
would--
mr.
john
d.
french
--well,
i
think
it
would
probably
be
three
schemes,
your
honor.
moreover,
i
want
to
say
again,
i
am
perfectly
happy
to
take
the
words
used
by
other
courts,
i
am
perfectly
happy
to
talk
about
transactions
or
episodes
or
to
get
entirely
out
of
the
commentators
and
the
cases
and
talk
about
groups
or
clusters
of
activity.
"relationship"
means
a
few
predicate
acts
leading
to
a
result.
"continuity"
has
to
mean
something
else,
and
i
say
it
has
to
mean
transactions
or
episodes
or
clusters
of
activity.
and
there
is
not
pleaded
in
this
particular
complaint,
and
the
plaintiff,
alas
for
the
plaintiff,
is
stuck
with
this
complaint
just
as
i
am
as
the
defendant.
it
is
the
only
record
here.
all
that's
pled
here
in
paragraphs
32
to
41
is
a
series
of
alleged
bribes,
culminating
in
one
and
only
one
allegedly
illegal
outcome.
that
appears
in
paragraph
75,
page
81
of
the
joint
appendix.
as
a
result
of
this
series
of
what
i
call
predicate
acts
and
what
judge
maclaughlin
thought
were
predicate
acts,
the
compensation
that
northwestern
bell
was
allowed
to
receive
by
the
puc
was
in
excess
of
what
would
be
fair
and
reasonable
charges
to
plaintiffs
and
members
of
the
class.
mr.
john
d.
french
it
says
several
people
were
bribed.
i
take
that
to
be
not
any
different
from
my
hypothetical
which
included
one
act
of
mail
fraud,
one
act
of
wire
fraud
and
one
act
of
securities
fraud.
several
people
were
bribed.
i
committed
several
frauds
in
my
hypothetical.
mr.
john
d.
french
i
believe
that
my
test
would
be...
i
will
give
you
a
hypothetical
that
i
think
would
satisfy
my
test,
but
it
is
not
pleaded
here.
if
i
committed
a
series
of
bribes
in
1980
and
obtained
a
rate
increase,
and
i
did
it
again
in
1983
and
obtained
a
different
kind
of
rate
increase
or
other
benefit
from
the
commission,
and
i
did
it
in
1986,
and
i
obtained
another
rate
increase
or
benefit
from
the
commission,
i
think
it
is
possible
within
a
scheme
test
or
a
transaction
or
episode
test
that
i
would
have
brought
myself
under
civil
rico.
mr.
john
d.
french
i
believe
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
french
i
don't...
i
can't
say
at
a
minimum
three
because
the
congress
said
two,
and
we're
stuck
with
that
also.
mr.
john
d.
french
but
as
the
opinion
for
the
court
said,
two
in
common
parlance
don't
ordinarily
add
up
to
any
kind
of
a
pattern.
so
i
would
think
it
would
be
the
very
rare
case.
perhaps
two
coupled
with
the
threat
of
continuing
illegal
activity
which
you
might
infer
if
you
were
dealing
with
an
illegal
enterprise
like
la
costa
nostra
instead
of
a
public
utility
that's
been
serving
customers
in
minnesota
for
75
years,
perhaps
in
that
limited
situation
two
would
be
enough.
i
would
think
it
would
be
rare.
your
honor,
i--
mr.
john
d.
french
--i
submit
that
that
is,
too,
your
honor.
i
agree.
mr.
john
d.
french
i
think
it
fits
my
test
because
i
can...
what
i
see
as
la
cosa
nostra
engaging
in
illegal
conduct,
which
allows
them
to
take
over
northwestern
bell
telephone
company,
for
example,
and
then
once
they've
got
control
of
northwestern
bell
telephone
company,
engaging
in
a
series
of
bribes
or
other
corrupt
acts
which
allows
them
to
obtain
more
money
than
they
should
have
received
from
the
public
utilities
commission,
and
then
moving
on
to
other
criminal
activity.
as
i
was
preparing
for
this
argument,
your
honor,
a
question
such
as
yours
was
put
to
me
by
one
of
my
co-counsel,
and
i
think
the
answer
is
that
your
hypothetical
doesn't
reflect
the
real
world.
i
know
i
am
not
supposed
to
fight
a
judge's
hypothetical,
but
i
have
to
fight
it
a
little
here.
i
know
what
can
be
pleaded
in
a
criminal
indictment
against
real
criminals.
yesterday
while
i
was
preparing
to
come
here,
i
read
the
indictment
in
united
states
v.
ferdinand
and
imelda
marcos.
the
charge
having
to
do
with
pattern
of
racketeering
activities
runs
for
32
pages
and
sets
forth
ten
clusters
of
activities
that
would
satisfy
any
judge
on
the
eighth
circuit
that
each
of
them
was
a
separate
scheme
or
transaction
or
episode.
now,
that
is
what
i
believe
the
united
states
justice
department
is
capable
of
doing
any
time
it
is
confronted
with
true
organized
crime,
and
it
is
not
remotely
what
these
plaintiffs
have
done
in
this
private
civil
litigation.
our
view
is
that
there's
nothing
wrong
with
the
eighth--
mr.
john
d.
french
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
d.
french
they
were
not,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
the
court...
several
of
the
opinions
expressly
recognized
the
court
wasn't
faced
with
pattern
of
racketeering
activity
in
sedima.
it
was
faced
with
two
other
questions:
do
we
have
to
find
prior
convictions,
and
do
we
have
to
find
something
special
called
racketeering
injury?
the
issue
was
not
before
the
court.
i
can
remember
justice
powell's
opinion
saying
i
have
to
agree
with
the
court
that
the
issue
is
not
here.
i
wish
it
were.
now,
perhaps
if
sedima
came
back,
the
court
would
find
no
pattern
of
racketeering
activity
there,
but
i'm
not
able
to
opine
on
that.
with
respect
to
the
present
case,
there
are,
i
think,
two
possibilities,
and
that
is
that
the
court
can
agree
that
some
variation
of
scheme
or
episode
or
transaction
is
a
correct
test,
and
that
as
a
result,
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
it
is
also
possible
that
the
court
could
conclude
that
one
of
the
other
circuits
that
has
suggested
a
multiple
factors
test...
and
i
know
i
don't
have
to
labor
the
court
with
multiple
factors.
it
appears
in
many
cases.
we've
collected
a
number
of
them
at
page
23
of
our
memorandum,
and
to
my
delight,
the
petitioner
has
cited
an
excellent
multiple
factors
case
that
i
would
be
happy
to
live
with
in
its
memorandum.
it's
the
morgan
v.
bank
of
waukegan
case
in
the
petitioners'
memorandum
at
page
28.
i
believe
the
court
could
say
that
under
a
multiple
factors
test,
it
can
also
affirm,
and
the
reason
i
feel
so
strongly
about
that
is
that
that's
exactly
what
judge
maclaughlin
did
in
this
case
in
the
district
court
in
minnesota.
when
the
case
was
first
argued
to
judge
maclaughlin,
i
argued
for
dismissal
under
the
eighth
circuit
test,
and
judge
maclaughlin
so
ruled.
petitioners
then
asked
judge
maclaughlin
on
rehearing
to
reconsider
what
test
he
would
apply,
and
having
knowledge
that
he
was
bound
by
the
eighth
circuit
test,
he
went
on
to
say,
nonetheless,
i
recognize
a
multiple
factors
test
is
being
applied
in
other
circuits,
and
i
will
apply
it
here
and
see
what
i
conclude.
and
as
judge
maclaughlin's
second
opinion
in
the
joint
appendix
notes,
he
looked
at
the
duration
of
criminal
activity,
the
threat
of
ongoing
criminal
activity,
the
presence
of
single
or
multiple
victims,
the
independent
harmful
significance
of
the
alleged
predicate
acts,
and
whether
the
alleged
conduct
is
a
regular
part
of
defendant's
business.
and
having
done
all
of
that,
he
nonetheless
found
that
the
complaint
failed
to
state
a
claim
under
rico.
relating
this
case,
if
the
court
please,
back
to
the
concerns
expressed
in
sedima,
i
was
impressed
yesterday
again
in
my
reading
to
read
the
testimony
of
senator
mcclellan
before
the
house
when
s.
30
went
over
for
consideration
there,
and
he
talked
about
organized
crime
quietly
sneaking
into
a
business,
infiltrating
it,
using
it
for
corrupt
purposes,
bilking
it
of
its
funds,
letting
it
fall
into
bankruptcy
and
dissolving
away
into
the
night.
i
believe
that
is
the
kind
of
criminal
activity
that
both
the
house
and
senate
were
seeking
to
prevent--
mr.
john
d.
french
--i'm
saying
exactly
that
because
if
i
don't
say
that--
mr.
john
d.
french
--the
continuity
vanishes
from
our
lexicon
here,
your
honor.
the
relationship
is
enough.
if
my
hypothetical...
let's
say
that
in
my
hypothetical,
instead
of
cheating
a
client,
i
took
control
of
a
business.
if
one
act
of
mail
fraud,
one
act
of
wire
fraud
and
one
act
of
securities
fraud
which
allows
me
to
acquire
a
business
brings
what
i
have
done
under
rico,
then
all
of
the
fraud
committed
in
america
is
under
rico.
instead
of
having
a
thousand
civil
cases
a
year
under
rico,
you
will
have
10,000
civil
cases
a
year
under
rico.
it
simply
must
be
that
the
congress
wanted
to
encompass
something
more
than
that
via
rico,
and
that's
what
makes
sense
because,
as
i
said
earlier,
in
this
particular
case,
for
example,
the
ramsey
county
attorney
has
convened
a
grand
jury
which
didn't
indict.
the
minnesota
public
utilities
commission
has
reopened
the
rate
proceeding
and
reconsidered
the
rate
to
be
applied.
the
attorney
general
of
minnesota
has
an
action
going
against
the
company
right
now
relating
to
past
rates.
it
is
simply
not
true
that
civil
rico
is
needed
in
the
instance
of
a
75
year
old
public
utility
that
has
an
office
building
in
downtown
minneapolis
that
occupies
a
city
block
and
that
has
engaged
in
a
sequence
of
activities
that
are
readily
open
to
public
scrutiny
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
entity
is
so
thoroughly
regulated.
i
do
not
believe
rico
applies
in
my
hypothetical,
justice
scalia.
the
court
has
before
it
here
a
situation
in
which
there
is
no
threat
of
organized
crime
infiltrating
legitimate
business,
and
there
is
no
threat
of
racketeering
activity
being
conducted
in
a
manner
that
cannot
be
reached
by
officials
of
the
state.
i
think
it
is
important
either
under
the
eighth
circuit
test
or
a
multiple
factors
test
that
applies
in
these
circumstances
for
the
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
below.
if
a
complaint
as
insubstantial
as
the
complaint
pleaded
here
today
is
allowed
to
stand,
then
everything
in
america
in
which
a
victim
claims
injury
by
reason
of
a
fraud
or
one
of
the
other
predicate
acts
set
forth
in
the
statute,
becomes
civil
rico,
and
state
common
law
has
been
federalized
with
a
treble
damages
remedy.
i
do
not
believe
that
is
what
congress
intended,
and
i
do
not
believe
that
that
is
what
this
court
should
allow.
thank
you
very
much.
