mr.
mark
reinhardt
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
a
review
of
the
dismissal
of
petitioners'
complaint
brought
under
18
u.s.c.
1961
and
1968,
commonly
known
as
rico.
the
specific
acts
alleged
in
our
complaint
were
a
series
of
bribes
carried
out
by
northwestern
bell
telephone
company
affecting
a
number
of
different
northwestern
bell
charges
ranging
from
pay
phone
rates
to
the
cost
of
buying
home
telephones.
these
bribes,
carried
out
over
a
period
of
years,
involved
various
bell
officials,
agents,
passing
over
$140,000
to
members
of
the
minnesota
public
utilities
commission.
the
public
utilities
commission
is
the
rate
setting,
semi
or
quasi-judicial
body
in
minnesota
that
sets
bell's
rates.
as
pointed
out
in
footnote
1
at
page
4
of
our
brief,
a
later
commission
discovered
this
activity
of
bell
and
reopened
one
of
the
many
affected
rates
because
of
this
undue
influence.
they
cut
that
tainted
rate
of
$57
million
by
over
$10
million.
this
discussion
should
be
broken
into
three
parts:
first,
the
eighth
circuit's
multiple
scheme
dismissal
of
this
case
should
be
reversed;
second,
what
is
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity';
and
third,
a
brief
discussion
of
amici's
organized
crime
connection
argument
which
we
submit
should
be
rejected.
first,
this
court
should
reject
the
eighth
circuit's
multiple
scheme
requirement.
nowhere
in
the
plain
words
of
the
statute,
or
indeed,
in
the
legislative
history,
do
we
find
the
words
"multiple
schemes".
pattern
is
defined
in
statute
1961
as
two
acts
of
racketeering
activity,
not
two
schemes,
just
two
acts.
there's
no
multiplicity
of
schemes
involved.
indeed,
a
reading
of
1962,
the
operative
portion
of
the
rico
statute,
shows
the
impossibility
of
the
eighth
circuit's
position.
1962
forbids
a
pattern
of,
forbids
a
person
of
acquiring
an
interest
in
an
enterprise
through
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity.
in
other
words,
there
is
a
pattern
plus
the
goal
of
acquiring
an
interest
in
this
enterprise.
these
two
together
form
a
single
scheme,
as
do
all
schemes.
you
have
a
pattern--
mr.
mark
reinhardt
--your
honor--
mr.
mark
reinhardt
--there
has
to
be
separate
acts,
a
pattern
of
acts
is
the
definition.
those
acts
could,
in
certain
limited
situations,
be
part
of
one
transaction,
although
the
word
"transaction"
is
hardly
self-defining.
mr.
mark
reinhardt
your
honor,
i
think
continuity
can
be
thought
of,
of
course,
as
a
series,
as
you
just
pointed
out,
a
number
of
transactions.
however,
i
believe
it
also
has
within
it
the
threat
of
being
a
series,
and
a
prime
example
is
the
watchmaker
case
cited
in
our
brief
where
some
hell's
angels
shot
some
police
officers
in
one
incident.
there
were
two
or
perhaps
three
acts
in
that
case.
there
was
no
other
acts
or
transactions
that
could
be
pointed
to,
but
it
was
clear
that
through
the
hell's
angels
enterprise
that
these
acts
were
committed
so
as
to
allow
for
the
threat
of
continuity
or
for
continuity.
so
in
certain
very
limited
situations
you
can
have
two
acts
that
do
allow
for
a
threat
of
continuity.
and
if
that
answers
your
question--
mr.
mark
reinhardt
--the
congress
continually,
in
its
debate
and
as
pointed
out
in
sedima,
said
that
a
pattern
is
made
up
of
both
relatedness
and
continuity,
that
that
is
what
a
pattern
is.
mr.
mark
reinhardt
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact,
it
is
this
criminal
enterprise--
mr.
mark
reinhardt
--it
is
consistent
with
that,
your
honor,
but
it
is
unduly
restrictive
in--
mr.
mark
reinhardt
--correct.
however,
as
i
pointed
out,
it
would
write
out
of
the
law
or...
well,
let
me
point
out,
1962(b)
forbids
always
only
a
single
scheme.
if
we
need
multiple
schemes,
we
would
have
written
out
of
the
law
1962(b),
if
we
follow
this
multiple
scheme
restriction
placed
upon
the
word
"pattern"
by
the
eighth
circuit.
furthermore,
even
if
multiple
schemes
were
not
a
legal
impossibility
under
1962(b),
there
is
little
merit
in
the
concept
as,
well,
respondent
would
argue
it
is
a
bright
line
test.
rather,
it
becomes
a
semantical
game:
do
we
in
this
case
have
a
series
of
bribes
committed
by
different
bell
employees
against
different
commissioners
affecting
different
rates,
involving
different
methods,
or
do
we
have
one
scheme
to
fix
rates?
it's
really
all
in
the
way
that
you
look
at
it.
the
eighth
circuit,
in
fact,
in
the
criminal
case,
kragness,
found
multiple
schemes
where
somebody
sold
two
different
drugs.
i
submit
that
that
easily
could
have
been
a
scheme
to
sell
drugs,
and
this
is
consequently
of
no
real
assistance
in
trying
to
find
out
what
"pattern"
means.
if
pattern
is--
mr.
mark
reinhardt
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
reinhardt
your
honor,
the,
i
believe
acts
listed,
the
40
or
45
acts
listed
by
congress
are
those
that
they
in
fact
believed
carried
with
it
that
threat.
mr.
mark
reinhardt
your
honor,
i
think
there
are
two
answers
to
that
that
occur
to
me.
the
first
is
that
congress
spoke
of
a
pattern
of
activity.
it
is
that
pattern
of
the
two
acts,
pattern
of
activity,
of
racketeering
activity,
racketeering
activity
being
the
commission
or
two
or
more
acts,
or
at
least
two
acts,
it
is
that
pattern
that
we
must
look
at
to
find
continuity
within
it,
not
extraneous
from
it
but
within
it.
is
the
act,
does
it
have
continuity
while
the
pattern
is
being
committed?
all
patterns,
or
many
patterns
end
when
they
are
discovered.
for
example,
a
criminal
enterprise,
if
you
arrest
everyone,
you
end
the
pattern.
are
they
going
to
escape
rico
now
because
they
are
all
in
jail?
i
don't
think
that
was
the
purpose
of
congress.
it
was
to
look
at
the
pattern
during
the
period
of
time.
just
as
the
word
"pattern"
has
that
element,
we
must
limit
it
to
the
pattern.
and
those
two
elements,
relatedness
and
continuity,
can
be
further
defined,
i
believe.
professor
michael
goldsmith,
in
a
cornell
law
review
journal
to
be
published
next
month,
distributed,
i
believe,
to
counsel
and
the
court,
defined
"pattern"
as
two
or
more
predicate
acts
that
are
related
to
each
other
or
to
the
enterprise,
and
secondly--
mr.
mark
reinhardt
--yes,
your
honor.
we
received
it
in
the
mail
and--
mr.
mark
reinhardt
--your
honor,
the
value
i
see
in
it
is
that
it
was
a
definition
that
is--
mr.
mark
reinhardt
--excuse
me?
mr.
mark
reinhardt
well,
your
honor,
that
was
my
information.
it
was
supplied
to
me.
at
any
rate,
the
definition
is
a
useful
one,
and
i
did
want
to
give
credit
and
not
be
accused
of
plagiarism,
yes,
your
honor,
thank
you.
he
said
it
was
two
or
more
predicate
acts
that
are
related
to
each
other
or
the
enterprise,
and,
justice
o'connor,
constitute
the
series,
a
threat
of
series
of
acts
or
a
series
of
acts,
and
that
is
the
continuity
aspect.
this,
by
the
way,
would
be,
i
believe,
excellent
jury
instructions,
a
simple
definition,
one
that
is
capable
of
being
understood
easily.
if
the
court
wanted,
it
could
toss
in
the...
the
charging
court
could
use
the
illustration
from
title
x,
which
this
court
used
in
footnote
14
of
sedima,
the
illustration
of
various
relationships
and
the
fact
that
they
can't
be
isolated.
this
definition
of
professor
goldsmith's
has
the
dual
purpose
of
being
limiting,
but
it
does
not
distort
the
clear,
broad
language
of
congress
and
the
instructions
that
the
act
be
interpreted
liberally.
mr.
mark
reinhardt
your
honor,
given
those
facts
alone,
i
would
answer
no,
that
they
do
not.
there
is
no,
within
that,
the
facts
that
you
gave
me,
i
do
not
see
a
threat
of
seriality
or
a
threat
of
continuity.
however,
if
the
kidnapper
was
part
of
an
enterprise
that
in
the
past
had
kidnapped
other
individuals,
then
perhaps
it
would.
you
have
to
look
not
only
at
the
relationship
between
the
acts,
but
also
to
the
relationship
to
the
enterprise.
mr.
mark
reinhardt
it
perhaps
would,
your
honor,
yes,
but
pattern,
your
honor,
carries
with
it
not
only
the
acts
and
the
relatedness
of
those
racketeering
acts,
but
also
the
continuity,
and
i
don't
know
if
the
continuity
there
would
be
present.
mr.
mark
reinhardt
your
honor,
i
am
sorry,
i
was
thinking
if
you
were
involved
in
mail
fraud
or
attempting
to
get
monies
falsely
through
the--
mr.
mark
reinhardt
--phone,
is
that
your
predicate?
mr.
mark
reinhardt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
reinhardt
i
believe
that
each
phone
call
could
be
prosecuted
separately,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
reinhardt
no,
they
do
not,
your
honor,
and
perhaps
that's
because
there
is
no
threat
of
continuity
there,
although--
mr.
mark
reinhardt
--well,
your
honor,
that
is
what
they
speak
of
when
they
speak
of
racketeering
acts,
but
we
must...
we
are
speaking
of
a
pattern
of
racketeering
acts,
and
it's
the
pattern
that
places
the
limitation
on
the
misuse
of
the
statute.
you
must
have
the
continuity,
as
pointed
out
by
justice
o'connor.
mr.
mark
reinhardt
it's
all
surrounding
one
act.
there's
no
series,
in
my
mind,
your
honor,
there's
no
series
of
activity.
mr.
mark
reinhardt
your
honor,
i
am
considering
the
act
the
kidnapping,
i
guess,
and
the
surrounding
elements
of
it.
where
the--
mr.
mark
reinhardt
--your
honor,
yes--
mr.
mark
reinhardt
--if
you
consider
that
watchmaker
example
as
if
two
officers
were
slain,
that
that
was
two
activities.
you
have
to
remember
that
there's
also
the
threat
of
continuity
in
certain
limited
situations.
continuity
has
with
it
not
only
seeing
the
repetition
but
the
knowledge
that
there
would
be
a
repetition
or
the
belief
that
there
would
be
a
repetition.
mr.
mark
reinhardt
your
honor,
again
that
turns
to
if
there
is
no
separate
continuity
that
one
can
find
through
the
enterprise,
then
i
would
say
yes,
you
need
separate
criminal
activity.
i
hesitate
to
use
the
word
"episode"
because
it's
been
used
in
many
different
cases
in
different
ways.
but
generally
speaking
you
would
have
separate
activity.
you
would
have,
in
our
case,
we
don't
have
one
bribe
with
different
payments,
we
have
different
people
affected
by
different
bribes,
et
cetera.
those
would
be
different
activities.
whether
because
of
lower
court
desire
to--
mr.
mark
reinhardt
--your
honor,
i
believe
the
american
bar
association
has
accepted
or
proposed
a
separate
activity...
i'm
not
sure
whether
they
call
it
a
transaction
or
not...
or
the
threat
of
that
activity.
i
would
include
the
threat
of
that
activity.
otherwise
we
would
be
eliminating
situations
such
as
watchmaker
which
clearly
should
be
within
the
statute.
whether
because
of
lower
court
desire
to
judicially
amend
the
statute
or
confusion,
some
courts,
including
the
eighth
circuit,
have
ignored
the
fact
recognized
by
this
court
in
sedima
that
congress
used
plain,
broad
and
clear
language
to
express
its
intent.
footnote
14
was
a
simple
and
clear
direction
on
two
elements,
the
two
elements
of
pattern:
continuity
and
relationship.
there
is
no
wording
in
there
if
multiple
schemes
test
or
schemes
test,
even.
sedima
followed
the
plain
words
of
the
statute,
and
i
submit
that
this
court
has
an
opportunity
to
direct
lower
courts
to
do
likewise.
thirdly,
there
was
argument
presented
by
the
amici
in
this
case
attempting
to
support
an
organized
crime
connection
requirement,
that
you
have
to
be
typical
of
organized
crime,
or
the
person
has
to
be
characteristic
of
organized
crime
in
order
to
violate
the
statute.
1961
defines
the
defendant
in
this
case
as
the
person,
and
that
person
is
any
individual
or
entity
capable
of
holding
a
legal
or
beneficial
interest
in
property.
there
is
no
additional
limitation
to
be
a
member
of
organized
crime.
there
is
no
additional
limitation
to
having
earned
most
of
his
income
from
crime.
it
is
a
simple
statute
without
those
limitations.
mr.
mark
reinhardt
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
reinhardt
well,
your
honor,
in
a
way
that
is
what
congress
said.
they
defined
racketeering
activity
in
(1),
and
they
did
not
add,
though,
when
committed
by
organized
crime.
they
said
these
acts.
it
is
defined
here.
there's
no
further
definitional
requirement
needed.
the
person
likewise
is
defined,
and
throughout
this
statute
you
will
see
no
limitation
to
organized
crime.
this...
and
in
fact,
the
person...
this
argument,
trying
to
limit
the
person
defendant
has
been
rejected,
and
now
the
amici
are
trying
to
work
it
in
through
the
word
"pattern",
through
the
action
word
in
the
statute,
not
though
the
subject
word.
but
footnote
14
in
sedima
has
already
recognized
that
congress,
and
indeed
this
court,
finds
two
elements
in
pattern:
relationship,
relatedness
and
continuity.
there
was
no
discussion
of
and
being
a
member
of
organized
crime
or
earning
your
money
through
organized
crime.
indeed,
justice
scalia,
the
congress
did
know
well
the
principle
of
including
substantial
income
from
crime
or
expert
criminality
because
they
did
it
in
title
x,
the
next
title
of
this
act,
where
they
said
if
you
have
a
pattern
and
you
have
substantial
income
and
you
are
an
expert
criminal,
then
you
get
enhanced
punishment.
clearly
those
were
not
included
within
pattern,
at
least
as
they
saw
pattern.
congress
well
knew
that
the
purview
of
rico
was
beyond
organized
crime.
the
sedima
decision
is
replete
with
examples
from
the
congressional
debate,
and
it's
well
laid
out
there.
the
new
york
city
bar
strenuously
objected
to
the
statute.
the
two
sponsors,
congressman
poff
and
senator
mcclellan,
both
explicitly
stated
that
it
extends
beyond
organized
crime.
the
predicate
acts,
as
pointed
out
in
sedima,
give
the
breadth
to
the
statute
because
they
include
acts
that
are
not
normally
committed
by
organized
crime.
the
organized
crime
connection
requirement
has
been
virtually
uniformly
rejected
by
lower
courts.
respondent
did
not
argue
this
to
the
eighth
circuit.
it
was
first
raised
here
by
amici,
and
of
course,
this
is
because,
ironically,
the
eighth
circuit
was
one
of
the
first
circuits
in
the
country
to
reject
the
organized
crime
connection
in
the
case
of
bennett
v.
berg.
i
submit
that
respondent
and
amici
miss
the
point
when
they
argue
that
legitimate
businesses
are
being
pulled
within
the
purview
of
rico.
only
those
who
commit
not
one
but
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity
are
within
rico.
such
businesses
forfeit
the
right
to
call
themselves
legitimate.
the
eighth
circuit's
attempt
to
restrict
the
statute
should
be
reversed,
this
case
should
be
remanded,
and
amici's
attempt
to
rewrite
rico
to
include
an
organized
crime
connection
requirement
should
be
rejected.
as
this
court
said
in
sedima,
legitimate
business
enjoys
no
immunity
from
the
consequences
of
criminal
activity.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
mark
reinhardt
thank
you,
your
honor.
your
honor,
in
response
to
mr.
french's
argument
that
the
floodgates
of
litigation
are
opened
on
rico,
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
are
but
85
rico
cases
per
month
out
of
23,000
federal
cases
being
pled
today,
and
that
has
been
double
for
approximately
two
years.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
the
court's
decision
in
shearson
american
express
where
they
subjected
rico
to
arbitration
surely
will
have
a
further
limitation
upon
that.
this
floodgates
argument
is
an
argument
that
you
frequently
hear
bantered
about,
but
i
submit
that
it
simply
hasn't
come
to
pass.
secondly,
i
submit
that
we
will
not
have
every
fraud
case
in
america
being
brought
before
the
federal
judiciary.
this
case
involved
bribery
over
a
period
of
five
years,
in
1983,
offering
employment
to
a
commissioner
while
still
sitting,
before
a
major
vote;
in
1985,
making
employment
arrangements
with
a
commissioner,
passing
$30,000
after
the
commissioner
left
the
court,
to
an
attorney
who
then
deposited
it
into
his
account.
it
was
listed
as
attorneys'
fees.
that
attorney
then
wrote
separate
checks
to
the
commissioner.
the
commissioner
then
got
back
on
the
commission
and,
interestingly
enough,
neglected
to
mention
when
required
to
do
so
by
minnesota
ethical
requirements
as
part
of
his
income,
neglected
to
mention
this
$30,000
he
had
just
received.
i
submit
this
is
not
a
mere
business
oversight;
this
is,
as
alleged
in
the
complaint,
out
and
out
bribery.
there
are...
we
state
in
our
complaint
that
it
affected
bell
charges.
we
don't
say
it
affected
one
charge.
it
went
on
for
a
period
of
years.
in
fact,
there
are
probably
40
or
50
rate
hearings
a
year.
the
particular
activity
centered
around
particular
rates.
however,
your
honor,
we
must
remember
that
we
have
not
even
been
allowed
to
conduct
discovery
yet
in
this
case.
the
facts
that
we
have
are
the
mere
bones
of
the
complaint,
and
i
allege
that
what
we
have
submitted
to
you
shows
a
clear,
ongoing
course
of
activity.
as
this
court
recognized,
rico
applies
to
illegitimate
as
well
as
legitimate
businesses.
mr.
mark
reinhardt
yes,
fair
and
reasonable
charges,
yes,
that
there
were
many
charges,
that
they
received
in
excess
of
the
fair
and
reasonable
charges
to
which
they
would
have
been
allowed.
mr.
mark
reinhardt
yes,
there
were
many
rate
proceedings
over
this
period
of
time,
your
honor,
and
in
fact,
submitted
with
memorandum
to
the
trial
court
was
much
material
relating
to
different
rate
hearings.
another
instance
here
used
by
mr.
french
as
one
of...
well,
before,
i
believe,
in
response
to
justice
kennedy,
i
mentioned
that
the
continuity
has
to
be
within
the
pattern.
we
cannot
look
to
whether
this
individual
has
a
life
of
crime
outside
the
pattern.
that's
not
what
congress
was
addressing.
they
weren't
addressing
the
individual,
they
were
addressing
the
pattern.
is
there
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity,
two
acts,
or
at
least
two
acts...
it
could
be
more
acts,
many
acts,
but
within
those
acts,
is
there
a
relationship
and
an
illustration
of
continuity,
a
serialness?
surely
there
is
in
the
instant
case.
mr.
mark
reinhardt
as
justice
kennedy--
mr.
mark
reinhardt
--your
honor,
many
courts
have
said
that
where
you
have
a
legitimate
enterprise
you
never
have
a
problem
of
continuity
because
obviously
the
continuity
is
ongoing.
i
think
that
really
addresses
an
illegitimate
enterprise.
however,
again,
even
there,
i
think
you
have
to
look
during
the
existence
of
the
acts,
the
barticheck
case,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
points
this
out
very
well.
if
you
catch
the
people,
they
are
not
doing
it
anymore.
it's
senseless
to
look
at
it
afterwards
or
elsewhere
or
before.
if
we
had
pled,
we
had
pled
perhaps
five
or
six
acts
of
racketeering,
if
we
had
pled
two,
do
we
satisfy
mr.
french's
definition
then
that
before
or
after
the
pattern
we
plead
there
were
acts?
it
becomes
a
very
semantical
game.
you
have
to
look
for
the
continuity
within
the
actual
pattern.
again,
as
justice
stevens
stated,
if
racketeer...
if
the
mafia
had
done
this
we
would
not
be
here
today.
there's
little
question
that
no
court
would
say
that
this
activity
should
be
forbidden.
yet
that
is
exactly
what
congress
dealt
with.
it
dealt
with
activity,
not
with
a
status
offense.
rico
is
not
a
person-oriented
status
offense.
it
is
an
offense
that
congress,
as
senator
mcclellan
said,
the
occasion
for
our
writing
this
law
is
being
confused
with
the
results
of
our
investigation.
they
found
activity
repugnant,
and
that
activity
was
activity
which
they
believed
was
committed
by
organized
crime,
and
indeed,
was.
but
it
is
the
activity
that's
repugnant.
if
anybody
commits
that
repugnant
activity,
they
should
be
condemned.
it
is
not
a
status
offense
to
be
committed
only
by
some,
only
by
a
few.
this
is
an
offense
which
lays
out
forbidden
activity,
and
that
activity,
if
committed
by
anyone,
deserves
the
punishment
that
rico
calls
for.
and
our
complaint
should
be
reinstated
for
those
reasons.
thank
you.
