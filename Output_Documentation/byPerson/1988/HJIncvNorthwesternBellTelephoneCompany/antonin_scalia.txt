justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
how
does
that
definition
or
your
proposal
apply
to
a
situation
where,
let's
say,
there
is
a
kidnapping,
and
the
kidnapper
makes
a
number
of
phone
calls
offering
to
return
the
captive
in
exchange
for
money?
is
each
one
of
those
phone
calls
a
separate
act,
and
is
that
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
each
phone
call
in
that
situation
be
prosecutable
and
punishable
by
imprisonment
for
more
than
one
year,
each
individual
phone
call?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
sure
about,
are
you
sure
about
the
answer
to
that
question?
i
thought
you
would
just
prosecute
somebody
for
the
one
kidnapping.
you
mean
every
time
they
make
a
separate
phone
call
you
can
get
a
different
sentence
for
each?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
could
change
it
to
that
situation,
fraud
through
phone
calls.
is
each
phone
call
a
separate
offense?
justice
antonin
scalia
when
only
you
are
asking
for...
all
that
you're
asking
for
is
one
payment?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
the
government
generally
do
that,
do
you
know?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
that
what
the
act
refers
to,
it
seems
to
read
that
way,
is
what
the
government
could
bring,
not
what
the
government
normally
does
bring.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
isn't
that
continuity?
i
made
a
series
of
phone
calls?
i
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
depends
on
what
you
consider
the
act.
if
you
consider
the
act
the
phone
call,
there's
a
series
of
them.
if
you
consider
the
act
the
kidnapping,
there's
only
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
what
about
the
word
"racketeering
activity"?
is
it
your
position
that
the
definition
in
<nineteen
sixty-one
five>
[=
1961(5)]
of
pattern
of
racketeering
activity
is
exclusive?
it
says
pattern
of
racketeering
activity
requires.
now,
that
means
you
need
at
least
two
acts.
it
doesn't
say
that
that
alone
is
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
couldn't
one
say
that
what
you
need
in
addition
is
activity
that
can
reasonably
be
characterized
as
racketeering
activity;
that
is
to
say,
the
kind
of
activity
that
would
normally
be
conducted
by
organized
crime?
justice
antonin
scalia
none
of
that
would
be
unlawful;
i
mean,
letting
it
decline
into
bankruptcy
and
all
of
that,
i
presume,
if
they
want
a
business
that
they
have
acquired
to
go
to
seed,
i
suppose
that's
all
right,
but
it
was
the
unlawful
acquiring
that
congress
was
addressed
to,
and
that
brings
us
back
to
judge
kennedy's
question
which
i'm
not
sure
you've
answered
very
satisfactorily.
if
you
take
over
an
enterprise
in
the
fashion
you've
just
described,
you're
saying
it
has
to
be
done
not
by
just
one
criminal
enterprise
or
transaction
or
grouping
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
but
you
need
three
different
ones,
or
at
least
two
different
ones.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
lose
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
your
contention
that
under
paragraph
75
of
the
complaint,
more
than
one
rate
proceeding
could
be
referred
to?
i
think
that
was
the
section
that
mr.
french
called
our
attention
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
many
different
rate
proceedings
were
involved.
