mr.
reinhardt,
at
least
you
take
the
position
that
there
have
to
be
separate
criminal
transactions
for
the
pattern.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
not
schemes,
at
least
separate
transactions.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i'm
not
sure
about
that.
how
do
we,
how
do
we
give
meaning
to
the
continuity
requirement
that
congress
clearly
intended
to
have
a
role
in
the
pattern
inquiry?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
there
have
to
be,
then,
some
sort
of
different
criminal
episodes
or
transactions
rather
than
just
isolated
acts?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
hasn't
the
american
bar
association
endorsed
the
separate
criminal
episode
or
transaction
approach?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but,
the
eighth
circuit
has
focused
on
separate
schemes,
and
that...
it
seems
to
be
almost
alone
in
doing
that.
other
circuits
have
talked
about
separate
criminal
transactions
but
not
schemes.
i
think
it's
a
little
hard
to
justify
the
eighth
circuit's
separate
schemes
approach,
and
are
you
going
to
address
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
don't
think
that
this,
the
facts
in
this
case
would
meet
the
seventh
circuit
test
for
separate
transactions
on
the
allegations?
