justice
antonin
scalia
mr....
mr.
schiff,
it
may
work
well
in
new
york
where
it's
easy
enough,
as
you
say,
although
i
guess
there's
some
contest
on
the
point,
to
pick
out
what
is
the...
the
intentional
tort
statute.
but
i
don't
know
how
such
a
line
would...
would
play
in...
in
other
states
where
you
may
have
a
general
personal
injury
statute,
but
then
one
statute
for
a
few
personal
torts,
another
statute
for
a
few
others,
another
statute
for
still
a
few
others.
this
isn't
the
kind
of
an
issue
i'm
anxious
to
have
a
lot
of
litigation
about.
why
shouldn't
we
have
a...
a
clear
line?
and
it
seems
to
me
the
general
personal
injury
statute
is
a...
is
a
clearer
line
than
what
you're
urging
upon
us,
maybe
not
clearer
in...
any
clearer
in
new
york
state,
but
we're
talking
about
all
the
courts
having
to
apply
this
in
50
states
and
with
changing
statutes
in
50
states
over
the
years.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
we
just
said
assault
and
battery?
there's...
if
you
apply
the
general...
the
general
statute
unless
there's
a
separate
one
for
assault
and
battery.
would
that...
would
that
create
any
problem?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
not
sure
it's
any
more
arbitrary
than
just
the
general
tort
statute
if
that
general
tort
statute
wouldn't
be...
wouldn't
be
covering,
as
it
apparently
would
not
in
new
york,
the...
the
majority
of
claims
that...
that
1983
was
concerned
with.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kimerling,
it
seems
to
me
your
position
on
this...
the
one
position
consumes
the
other.
if
you
say
we
should
strike
down
everyone
that's...
that's
one
year
anyway,
then
what
difference
does
it
make
whether...
whether
we
agree
with
new
york
state
and...
and
select
a...
select
a
statute
that
in
many
instances
will
be
a
one-year
statute?
whenever
it
is
we
will
ignore
it
anyway.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
whichever
we
choose,
you're
going
to
tell
us
to
ignore
it
whenever
it's
one
year.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
as
justice
o'connor
says,
no
choice
available
to
us
will
produce
that
happy
state
of
affairs
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's...
there's
no
possible
rule
we
can
adopt
that
will
result
in
the
selection
in
all
states
of
a
statute
that
is
more
than
one
year.
right?
