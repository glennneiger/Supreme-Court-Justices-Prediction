mr.
kimerling,
are
you
suggesting
that
our
search
for
simplicity
that
justice
o'connor
thought
was
illusory,
really
is
illusory
if
we're
going
to
get
this
issue
next?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
happen
to
know...
in
her
dissent
in
the
wilson
case
justice
o'connor
pointed
out
there
had
been
several
bills
introduced
in
congress
in
recent
years
to
prescribe
a
single
statute
of
limitations
for
1983.
do
you
know
what
periods
of
limitations
most
of
those
bills--
