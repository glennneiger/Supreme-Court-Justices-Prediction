mr.
peter
h.
schiff
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
respondent
in
this
case
alleged
that
he
was
battered
and
beaten
by
the
petitioners
during
an
arrest
on
the
campus
at
the
state
university
of
new
york
in
albany
in
january
of
1984.
this
suit
was
filed
22
months
later.
petitioners
moved
to
dismiss
on
the
grounds
of
the
statute
of
limitations
contending
that
a
one-year
statute
of
limitations
should
have
been
applied.
both
the
district
court
and
the
second
circuit
rejected
our
position.
the
case
came
up
here
presumably
because
of
the
conflict
with
the
eleventh,
sixth
and
fifth
circuits.
i
might
mention
that
prior
to
the
time
that
he
filed
this
suit,
respondent
had
sought
recovery
from...
in
the
new
york
court
of
claims
based
on
a
1983
action
against
the
state,
but
that
was
dismissed
because
1983
actions
did
not
lie
against
the
state
in
the
court
of
claims.
the
basic
issue
here
is
how
to
apply
the
principles
that
this
court
announced
in
wilson/garcia
in
1985.
respondent
also
argues
that
if
the
court
rules
in
petitioners'
favor,
that
the
decision
should
be
applied
prospectively
only.
i
intend
first
to
discuss
the
merits
of
which
statute
of
limitations
should
be
borrowed
and
then
will
argue
that
the
decision
should
not
be
applied
prospectively
only.
in...
in
wilson,
this
court
decided
that
a
single
statute
of
limitations
should
be
borrowed
under
section
1988
for
each
state
for
purposes
of
1983
cases,
and
that
the
proper
choice
would
be
a
personal
injury
statute
of
limitations
of
general
applicability.
wilson
involved
the
state
of
new
mexico
which
has
only
one
such
personal
injury
statute
of
limitations.
now,
in
the
course
of
its
decision
in
wilson,
the
court
rejected
two
other
possible
statute
of
limitations.
one
was
the
one
relating
to
remedies
for
wrongs
committed
by
public
officials
and
that
was
viewed
as
inconsistent
with
the
purposes
of
1983
since
one
of
the
very
purposes
of
the
act
was
that
the
state
remedies
were
insufficient.
and
the
other
statute
of
limitations
considered
were
for
suits
arising
under
statutory
claims.
but
the
court
pointed
out
that
back
in
1871
when
19...
section
1983
was
enacted
as
section
1
of
the
ku
klux
klan
act,
that
there
were
few
such
claims,
such
statutory
claims.
the
difficulty
has
arisen
since
wilson
because
more
than
half
the
states,
including
new
york,
have
more
than
one
personal
injury
statute
of
limitations
that
are
generally
applicable.
and
it
is
our
position
that
the
statute
of
limitations,
consistent
with
wilson,
should
be
used
as
the
one
applies
to
intentional
personal
torts,
at
least
particularly
those
that
encompass
assault,
battery
and
false
imprisonment.
now,
the
reason
we
make
this
argument
is
that,
as
the
court
explained
in
wilson,
the
very
catalyst
of
the
ku
klux
klan
act
was
the
campaign
of
violence
and
deception
in
the
south
that
had
been
fomented
by
the
klan
which
was
denying
decent
citizens
their
political
and
civil
rights.
now,
that
was
being
accomplished
by
the
klan
through
acts
of
violence,
whippings,
shootings,
murders
and
so
forth.
and
it
is
for
this
reason
that
three
of
the
circuits,
initially
judge
johnson
in
the
eleventh
circuit,
concluded
that
the
logic
was
that
therefore
the
personal
injury
statute
of
limitations
which
dealt
with
those
subject
matters
was
the
most
appropriate
to
be
borrowed.
now,
our
opponents
suggest
in
their
brief
that
the...
section
1
of
the
klan
act
was
not
directed
against
violations
by
the
clansmen
themselves,
but
rather
against...
suits
against
the
local
and
state
officials
who
were
not
coping
with
the
reign
of
terror
being
perpetrated
by
the
klan.
that
argument
assumes
that
everyone
sued
under
1983
must
be
a
state
official.
that
simply
isn't
true
under
the
decisions
of
this
court.
to
be
sure,
there
is
a
need
that
the
action
be
under
color
of
law.
but
this
court's
decisions
in
annex
v.
cress,
1970;
dennis
v.
sparks,
1980,
have
made
it
clear
that
it
is
enough
that
the
defendant
be
a
willful
participant
in
joint
action
with
the
state
or
its
agents.
private
persons
jointly
engaged
with
state
officials
in
a
challenged
action
are,
indeed,
acting
under
color
of
law
for
section
1983
purposes.
and
this
would
be
true,
as
the
court
explained
in
the
dennis
case,
even
if
the
state
actor
who
provides
the
basis
for
the
action
himself
or
herself
might
be
immune
from
suit
such
as
a
judge,
prosecutor,
law
enforcement
officials.
now,
this
court
recognized
in
annex
that
state
involvement
might
result
from
the
police
intentionally
tolerating
violence
directed
at
those
seeking
to
assert
their
civil
rights.
and
that's
exactly
the
kind
of
situation
that
we
think
congress
did
envision
in
1871
when
it
enacted
the
ku
klux
klan
act.
the
klan
was
then
viewed
by
the
republican
supporters
of
the
act
as
a
group
designed
to
aid
the
democratic
party
and
to
deter
the
supporters
of
that
party,
both
black
and
white,
from
voting.
and
the...
excuse
me...
there
are
references
in
the
debates,
which
have
been
discussed
by
this
court
on
numerous
occasions,
to
persist
in
discriminatory
refusals,
to
enforce
the
laws
by
state
officials
in
some
parts
of
the
postbellum
south.
this
showed
a
belief
that
the
klan
was
acting
with
the
deliberate
acceptance
of
local
law
enforcement
officials.
indeed,
the
congressional
record...
congressional
globe
showed
the
belief
that
the
klan
was
acting
in
collusion.
there
were
signals
passed
between
members
of
the
klan
and
law
enforcement
officials
with
people
in
the
jury
box
and
so
forth.
so,
we
believe
that
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
section
1
of
the
klan
act,
section
1983,
certainly
viewed
by
the
congress
in
1871
as
one
tool
to
be
used
to
permit
suits
with
respect
to
the
violent
acts
of
the
klan
members
themselves.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
we
think
that
the
analysis
of
this
court
in
wilson
was
in
large
measure
a
historic
analysis
not
totally,
but
in
large
measure
a
historic
analysis
as
which
would
be
the
most
appropriate
statute
to
use.
the
1983
actions
essentially
are
all
or
mostly
intentional
torts.
now,
they're
not
all
violent
torts,
but
they
certainly
mostly
involve
intention.
there
are
still
some
open
questions
as
to
whether
wanton
misconduct
or
perhaps
a
high
level
of
negligence...
and
certainly
simple
negligence
is
not
sufficient
for
a
1983
cause
of
action.
so,
we
think
that
the
historical
context
shows
a...
the
reason
why
where
there's
more
than
one
personal
injury
statute
of
limitations
in
the
state,
that
the
state...
that
the
one
that
should
be
chosen
is
the
one
that
does
relate
to
the
kind
of
acts
that
were
being
considered
back
in
1871.
we...
respondents
argue
in
their
brief
that
our
position
would
result
in
further
litigation
because
of
alleged
difficulties
in
choosing
among
intentional
tort
statutes
in
states
where
there
is
more
than
one
such
statute.
we
think
that
the
contention...
the
assertion
of
confusion
is
really
not
well-founded.
indeed,
their
own
appendix
a
to
their
brief,
which
lays
out
the
various
statutes
of
limitations,
shows
that
in
general
where
there
is
more
than
one,
the
reason
for
being
more
than
one
is
that
there's
a
separate
statute
of
limitations,
usually
shorter,
for
libel
and
slander.
now,
it's
pretty
clear
that
this
history
i've
just
recounted
simply
doesn't
provide
a
basis
for
picking
libel
and
slander
statutes.
it's
the
ones
that
involve
the
more
assault
directed
torts.
the...
i'd
also
point
out
that
looking
at
the
new
york
statute
of
limitations,
which
is
not
atypical,
that
if
you
choose
a
statute
for
which
they
contend,
the
one
that
essentially
applies
to
all
personal
injury
statute...
has
a...
all
personal
injuries
other
than
those
listed
in
other
statutes,
which
includes
a
series
of
other
provisions.
there's
a
separate
one
for
malpractice
and
then
the
intentional
tort
and
some
other
ones.
but
the
bulk
of
those
actions
brought
under
that
statute
of
limitations
would
relate
to
negligence
actions,
product
liability
cases,
the
very
types
of
cases
that
this
court
has
indicated
simply
would
not
give
rise
to
a
1983
cause
of
action.
it
would
be
really
quite
anomalous
to
pick
the
negligence
statute.
respondents
also
make
an
argument
historically
that
the
division
that
we
have
made
is
allegedly
inconsistent
with
the
way
statutes
of
limitations
reviewed
at
that
time,
referring
to
a
text
of
professor
prosser,
among
others...
we
think
that
their
discussion
there
between
direct
and
indirect
force
kind
of
torts,
while
interesting
historically,
wasn't
even
valid
by
1871
as
prosser's
text
itself
shows.
and,
indeed,
if
one
looks
at
appendix
b
in
their
brief,
it
will
appear
that
the
kind
of
dichotomy
between
assault,
battery,
false
imprisonment,
malicious
prosecution
and
so
forth
and
other
kind
of
personal
injuries,
the
kind
that
is...
exists
in
today's
statute,
was
pretty
much
true
at
that
time.
the
second
circuit
seemed
to...
seemed
to
hold
and
our
respondents
argue
that
a
one-year
statute
of
limitations
is
inconsistent
with
federal
law.
now,
we
think
there's
absolutely
no
merit
to
this.
this
court,
as
far
as
i
can
read
the
cases,
has
never
decided
inconsistency
of
a
state
statute
of
limitations
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
length
of
time.
it
has
looked...
as
in
the
burnett
v.
grattan
case,
it
has
rejected
a
state
statute
of
limitations
on
a
functional
basis.
there
that
related
to
administrative
discrimination
proceedings,
and
the
maryland
statute
is
not
directed
to
general
litigation.
so,
that
was
rejected.
however,
it
is
of
interest
that
three
of
the
justices
of
this
court
in
burnett
in
a
concurring
opinion
pointed
to
the
one-year
statute
of
limitations
that
relates
to
section
1986,
which
was
section
7
of
the
ku
klux
klan
act
of
1871,
which
does
include
a
one-year
statute
of
limitations.
and
the
concurring
opinion
noted
that
one
year
would
certainly
be
appropriate
for
1983
actions.
and
we
think
that
is
surely
true
since
the
kind
of
proceedings
are
not
that
different.
the
type
of
evidence
that
needs
to
be
obtained
in
the
great
bulk
of
the
cases
is
not
materially
different.
we
also
think
it's
important
that
there...
a
one-year
statute
of
limitations
has
been
recognized
as
being
appropriate
in
many
1983
cases.
and,
of
course,
four
jurisdictions,
including
california,
apply
a
one-year
statute
of
limitations
to
personal
injuries
generally
so
that
any
determination
that
one
year
was
somehow
inconsistent
would
pose
serious
problems
as
to
the
applicability
of
wilson
to
those...
those
states.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
our
position
is
that
the...
the
line
that
should
be
chosen
is...
is
not
solely
to
try
to
determine
whether
a
statute
applies
to
all
intentional
torts.
our
position
is
that
the
one
that
should
be
chosen
in
a
state...
and
i
think
it's
not
too
difficult
if
when
you
do
examine
this
appendix...
is
the
one
that
encompasses
assault,
battery
and
false
imprisonment.
now,
that...
that...
there
is
one
that
includes
that
plus
others
in
at
least
24
of
the
jurisdictions.
now,
our
opponents
suggest,
well,
there
would
be
difficulties.
look
at
alabama.
but
alabama
is
a
case
where
the
eleventh
circuit
already
determined
that
the
intent...
which
intentional
tort
statute
should
apply.
i...
i
think
the
debate
below
as
to
whether
new
york
statute
was
general
or...
or
not
general
is
somewhat
misconceived
and...
because
however
you
look
at
it,
the
new
york
statute
admittedly
covers
the...
the
important
personal
intentional
torts
in...
in
view
of
the
history
of
the
klan
act.
i'm
not
sure
that
i
would
agree
either
that--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--well,
i
think
virtually
all.
our
opponents
may
be
correct
that
on
some
malpractice
cases
that
the
malpractice
litigation,
whether
it's
intentional
or
not,
would
take
precedence,
but--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--which?
i'm
sorry.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
yes,
it
only
covers
intentional
torts.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
it
lists...
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
no,
no.
it's
not
broken
down
language-wise
in
that
context.
i
should
add
in
finishing
the
previous
question
that
i
don't
think
it's
clear
that
you
have
a
simple
solution
if
you
decide
to
pick
so-called
general
personal
injury
statutes.
i
believe
justice
o'connor
pointed
out
in
her
dissent
in
wilson
that
the
tenth
circuit...
again,
the
case
arising
from
colorado...
i
don't
quite
remember
the
name...
mishmash
or
something
like
that.
the
court
did
not
choose
either
personal
injury
statute,
but
chose
one
that
applied
residually.
and
as
i
say,
one
of
the
difficulties
with
applying
a...
the
general
personal
injury
statute
that
you
would
be
picking
a
statute
that
essentially
is
covering
torts
that
would
not
possibly
give
rise
to
1983
actions.
and
we
don't
have
good
statistics,
but
there
are
statistics
listed
in
the
appendix
to
the
district
court
opinion
in
the
hobson
case
in
the
district
of
columbia,
which
is
cited
in
our...
in
respondent's
brief.
and
if
you
look
at
the
actual
statistics
that
judge
oberdorfer
had
developed
in
the
district
of
columbia,
i
suggest
that
it
shows...
that
there
isn't
a
great
deal
left
of
the
suits
although
it's
not
entirely
easy
to
tell
if
you
carve
out
the
negligence
and
product
liability
cases.
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
issue
of
whether
the
decision
here
should
be
applied
prospectively
only.
it
is
our
position
that
since
this
court
would
be
making
a
new
decision
as
to
the
appropriate
statute
of
limitations
to
be
chosen,
that
the
principle
described
by
this
court
in
stovall
v.
denno
in
388
u.s.
should
apply,
and
that
since
this
court
only
decides
concrete
cases,
it
would
have
to
apply
the
decision
here
to
this
case
because
otherwise
there
would
be
no
case.
the
last
term
there
were
two
cases
involving
the
statute
of
limitations
under
section
1981.
those
decisions
are
perfectly
consistent
with
our
position
here.
in
goodman
v.
lukens
steel,
the
statute
of
limitations
was
applied
retroactively,
but
not
necessarily
on
this
analysis.
however,
the
reason
in
that
case
at
least
or
the
facts
in
that
case
show
that
the
statute
of
limitations
would
not
have
been
fully
dispositive
of
the
case,
but
it
simply
determined
the
length
of
time
for
which
damages
would
be
awarded.
there
was
also
injunctive
relief
so
that
there
was
a
concrete
case
regardless
of
what
the
decision
was
in
the
statute
of
limitations.
the
other
case
is
st.
francis
college.
that
case...
both
of
those
cases,
goodman
and
st.
francis
college,
both
came
from
the
third
circuit,
a...
but
they
were
decided
in
reverse
order
by
this
court
from
the
way
they
were
decided
by
the
third
circuit.
in
the
third
circuit...
the
third
circuit
had
first
decided
that
the
personal
injury
statute
of
limitations
should
apply
to
1983
actions
in
goodman.
then
the
st.
francis
college
case
came
along,
and
they
said
we
are
now
applying
the
goodman
rule
to
a
later
case
and
therefore
chevron
oil
v.
huson
applied.
and
that
certainly
was
correct.
but
when
it
got
to
this
court,
this
court
simply
assumed
for
the
purpose
of
st.
francis
that...
that
the
personal
injury
statute
would
apply
and
it
wasn't...
didn't
make
that
decision.
so,
it
applied
the
same
principle
and
it
actually
decided
the
merits
of
the
19...
1981
statute
of
limitations
and
the
later
goodman
case.
in
these
circumstances,
neither
of
those
cases
in
any
way
departs
from
our
view
that
the
decision
here
should
be
applied
in
this
case.
unless
you
have
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
peter

schiff
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
i
would
only
ask
the
court
to
reverse
and
direct
that
the
complaint
be
dismissed.
thank
you.
