chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
87-56,
owens
and
lessard
v.
okure.
mr.
schiff,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
schiff.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
kimerling.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
since...
since
our
decision
in
daniels
and
davidson,
certainly
any
due
process
claims
sound
very
much
in
intent
and
not
in
mere
negligence.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
those
are
brought
under
1983.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
my
question
to
you
is
about
the
due
process
intent,
not
equal
protection.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
a
procedural
due
process.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
think
what's
the
answer?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
negligence
is
not
there.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
new
york...
by
new
york's
providing
one
year
for
an
assault
and
three
years
for
negligence,
it
means
new
york
is
less
interested
in
seeing
a
claim
for
assault
vindicated
than
a
claim
for
negligence
vindicated?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's
an
exception
then
to
wilson
v.
garcia
if
a
state
has
a
one-year
general
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i'm
just
really
following
up
on--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--justice
o'connor's
question.
you
say
that
wilson
v.
garcia
doesn't
apply
if
a
state
has
a
general
personal
injury
statute
of
limitations
of
one
year?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
this
derived
from
wilson
v.
garcia...
what
you're
talking
about?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
kimerling.
mr.
schiff,
you
have
six
minutes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
justice
marshall
has
two
opinions
of
the
court
to
announce.
