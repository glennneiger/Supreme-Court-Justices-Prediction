justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
various
states
have
adopted
a
one-year
personal
injury
general
statute
of
limitations,
haven't...
haven't
they?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
they're...
they're
not
inadequate,
are
they,
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
you
would
have
us
hold
that
even
those
states
that
have
opted
clearly
for
a
one-year
statute
of
limitations
can't
do
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
congress
itself
adopted
a
one-year
statute
of
limitations
for
section
1986,
didn't
it?
