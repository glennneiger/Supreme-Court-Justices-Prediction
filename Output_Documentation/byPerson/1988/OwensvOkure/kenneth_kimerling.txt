mr.
kenneth
kimerling
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
what
petitioners
seek
here
will
undermine
everything
that
this
court
sought
to
accomplish
in
wilson
v.
garcia.
the
explicit
motivating
purpose
of
the
wilson
decision
was
to
provide
some
uniformity
and
provide
some
certainty
to
the
question
of
the
statutes
of
limitations
under
1983
actions
and
therefore
avoid
unnecessary
and
time
consuming
litigation
in
1983
claims.
at
that
time,
the
lower
courts
followed
a
myriad
of
different
practices
in
determining
the
appropriate
state
statute
of
limitations.
some
courts
looked
at
the
specific
factual
allegations
in
a
complaint
and
tried
to
match
them
with
state
common
law
and
statutory
claims.
other
courts
took
a
particular
statute
of
limitations
and
said
this
applies
in
all
1983
claims,
but
these
decisions
varied
from
panel
to
panel
and
from
circuit
to
circuit.
what
petitioners
seek
here
will
recreate
that
type
of
unnecessary
and
time-consuming
litigation
because
there
is
not
but
one
statute
of
limitations
that
covers
intentional
torts,
but
two
in
32
or
33
states
that
we've
looked
at
and
put
in
our
appendix.
and
there
is
no
clear,
bright
line
to
deciding
among
them.
in
new
york,
for
example,
if
a
prisoner
has
an
eighth
amendment
claim
against
a
prison
doctor,
do
you
use
the
two
and
a
half
year
statute
of
limitations
that
applies
for
personal
injury
claimants
against
doctors,
or
do
you
use
the
one-year
provision
that
applies
to
certain
specific
torts?
well,
if...
if
you
go
along
and
say,
well,
chose
the
one
that...
that
specifies
intentional
torts,
what
do
you
do
in
alabama
where
there's
a
six-year
provision
that
specifies
three
intentional
torts
and
a
two-year
provision
that
specifies
three
or
more
intentional
torts?
and
it's
not
simply
a
question
of
choosing
which
covers
the
most
for
in
alabama
and
in
other
states,
often
they're
equally
divided.
and
if
you're
going
to
go
to
most,
how
do
you
count
them?
in...
in
arizona,
for
example,
there
is
a
general
provision
that
covers
assault
and
battery,
as
there
is
in
texas,
but
it
doesn't
specify
it.
but
there
is--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--it...
it
would
not,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
because--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--well,
i...
i
don't
think
that
that's
what
will
happen
because
many
statutes
cover
both.
as
you
pointed
out
in
your
question,
there
are
statutes
that
cover
intentional
and
unintentional
torts,
as
the
arizona
provision
does.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
i...
i
don't
think
that
would
create
any
problems,
but
i
think
that
line
would
be
an
arbitrary
one
and
not
consistent
at
all
with
the
statutory
history
of
section
1983.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
that's...
i
think
that's
important
misconception
of
what
1983
was
concerned
about.
nineteen
eighty-three
was
not
concerned
about
the
direct
violence
of
the
klan.
there's
a
quote
that
we
provide
in
our
brief
right
out
of
monroe
v.
pape.
in
monroe
v.
pape
says:
"while
the
main
scourge
of
the
evil...
perhaps
the
leading
one...
was
the
ku
klux
klan,
the
remedy
created
in
1983
was
not
a
remedy
against
it
or
its
members,
but
against
those
representing
a
state
in
some
capacity
who
were
unable
or
unwilling
to
enforce
a
state
law.
"
so
that
the
assault
and
battery
provisions
in
an
historic
context
aren't
the
provisions
that
were
the
provisions
that
were
most
analogous
to
the
types
of
claims
that
would
have
been
brought
under
1983
and
certainly
they
don't
make
any
sense
in
the
present
context
of
the
myriad--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--excuse
me?
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
oh,
absolutely.
we
agree
that
wilson
makes
a
lot
of
sense.
wilson
said
let's
have
a
broad
characterization
and
it
broadly
defined
1983
as
to
cover
personal
injury.
but
to
go
much
narrower
than
that
and
to
try
to
get
a...
a
tighter
mesh
or
fix
would
create
the
same
lack
of
unity
and
the
lack
of
certainty
that
this
court
tried
to
obtain
and
could...
and
did
obtain
in
wilson
by...
by
designating
the...
the
statute
of
limitation
that
covered
the
general
remedy
for
personal
injury
actions.
this
court
found
in
wilson
that
congress
would
have
characterized
1983
as
providing
a
general
remedy
for
injuries
to
personal
rights.
and
i
think
that's
the
guiding
light
that
we
point
to,
and
that's
why
we
think...
we
agree
with--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--well--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--i...
i
think
that...
that
when
you
try
to
take
the
word
"intentional
tort"
and
use
that
word
"intent"
and
apply
it
in
a
constitutional
context,
you
have
two
different
words
with
two
different
meanings.
certainly
when
you
talk
about
one
of
the
primary
concerns
of
1983,
which
was
the
denial
of
equal
protection
and
you
talk
about
intent,
you're
not
talking
about
the
kind
of
intent
that's
involved
in
an
intentional
tort.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
well,
in
the
substantive
due
process
area--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--in
procedural
due
process,
i
don't
think
that
that's
the
answer
and
i
don't
think
it
has
been
resolved
in...
in
those
two
cases.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
that
is
that...
that
intent
is
the...
has
been
determined.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
i
don't
think
in
the
area
of
procedural
due
process
that
this
court
has
determined
that
intent
is
an
element
in
the
denial--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--well,
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
the...
but
if...
that's
not
my
reading
of
those
cases.
but,
nevertheless,
the...
the
content
and...
and
the
use
of
intent
in
most
constitutional
settings
has
no
relationship
to
its
use
in
intentional
torts.
and
it's...
and
it
really
is
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation...
excuse
me...
statutory
interpretation.
and
if
you
look
back
at
1871
and
you
look
back
at
the
statutes
of
limitations
in
effect
at
that
time,
you
see
that
they
retained
a
lot
of
their
english
roots
in
that
they
were
divided
between
statutes
of
limitations
that
covered
trespass
claims,
assault,
battery
and
false
imprisonment
and
statutes
of
limitations
that
covered
action
on
a
case,
which
were
the
general
personal
injury
provisions
of
the
time.
and
the
difference
between
trespass
and
action
on
the
case
is
not
the
difference
between
intent
and
non-intent.
rather,
it's
the
difference
between
direct,
physical
force,
which
is
a
trespass,
and
indirect
injury.
one
of
the
classic
examples
that
the
courts
used
and
continue
to
use
to
describe
that
difference
is
a
situation
where
someone
throws
a
log
onto
the
highway.
if
you're
hit
by
that
log,
you
have
a
claim
for
trespass
because
it's
a
direct,
physical
force
injury.
if
you
come
along
the
highway
later
and
trip
over
it,
you
have
an
action
on
the
case.
and
if
you
look
at...
at
what
was
at
issue
in...
in
1871,
it
wasn't
these
tortuous
acts
of
the
klan.
yes,
they
were
the
catalyst,
but
what
they
were
trying
to
do
was
to
insure
that
the
state
provided
an
adequate
and
effective
remedy
for
these
klan
acts.
and
if
the...
if
the
state
failed
to
do
that,
that
would
be
an
indirect
injury
because
there
would
be
no
direct,
physical
force
so
that
the
current
day
descendants
of
the
trespass
provisions
are
the
intentional
tort
provisions,
and
the
current
day
provisions
of
the
action
on
the
case
are...
are
the
general
provisions.
and
i
think
it's
significant
that
at
that
time
they...
in
section
1986,
they
referred
to
action
on
the
case
as
the
appropriate
remedy.
section
1986...
it
was
passed
as
part
of
this
package,
the
sherman
amendment...
covers
the
situation
where
a
state
or
local
government
is
aware
of
some
purported
klan
activity,
is
capable
of
doing
something
to
stop
it,
and
takes
no
action.
the
person
who
is
injured
by
that
klan
action
can
then
sue
that
state
or
local
government.
and
congress
specified
action
on
the
case.
and
this
is
a
parallel
type
of
remedy,
although
much
more
limited
in
scope
than
1983,
but
it's
in
recognition
that
congress
was
thinking
in
these
terms
and
therefore
the
present
day
descendants
of
those
provisions...
the
action...
excuse
me...
the
general
remedy
for...
for
personal
injuries
are
the
ones
that
congress
would
have
designated
at
that
time.
and
not
only
are...
are
these
provisions
the
most
analogous,
but
they're
the
most
appropriate.
and
appropriateness,
as
this
court
defined
in
burnett
v.
grattan,
means
that
a
statute
of
limitations
must
take
into
account
the
goals
and
policies
underlying
section
1983
and
as
well
take
into
account
the
practicalities
of
litigation.
and
congress
in
1871
was
seeking
a
broad
and
effective
remedy.
it
was
a
unique
remedy,
one...
one
that
didn't
exist
and
they
wanted
to
ensure
that
the
rights
under
the
bill
of
rights
passed
on
to...
to
everyone
through
the
fourteenth
amendment
were
being
enforced.
it
would
be
totally
inappropriate
and
totally
inconsistent
to
attach
that
broad
remedy
to
some
truncated
statutory
period.
the...
if
you
look
at
new
york's
statutory
scheme,
for
example,
you
see
that
there's
a
one-year
provision
for
some
of
these
specified
intentional
torts,
a
three-year
provision
for
the
general
remedy
for
personal
injury,
a
three-year
provision
for
civil
rights
claims
against
state
actors,
and
a
six-year
provision
for
certain
constitutional
claims.
that's
new
york's
own
view
of
the...
of
the
relative
importance
of
those
different
types
of
claims.
this...
this
court
has
pointed
out
that
statutes
of
limitations
are
a
weighing
process.
what
is
a
legislature's
interest
in
the
vindication
of
a
certain
claim
as
opposed
to
the
interests
and
repose?
and
that
array
represents
new
york's
interest,
and
it
shows
that
these
kinds
of
intentional
torts
are
at
the
bottom.
well,
certainly
congress
in
1871
didn't
view
these
as
the
least
important
of
its
remedies.
this
was
the
most
important.
this
is
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
this
is
the
bill
of
rights.
and
if
anybody
should
have
a
right
to
vindicate
that,
it
should...
it
should
be--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--i...
i
think
that's
in
part
the
answer,
and
the
other
answer
is
that...
that
new
york
believes
that
assault
types
of
claims
are
quickly
known
and
therefore
can
be
quickly
brought.
that's
what
the
state
legislature
said
in
1960
when
it
reduced
this
intentional
tort
statute
of
limitations
from
two
years
to
one.
and...
and
it
goes
also
to
this
burton
v.
grattan
equation
or
standard
for
appropriateness.
what
is
the
question
about
whether
or
not
it
takes
into
account
the
practicalities
of
litigation?
we
know
from
this
court's
decision
in
felder
v.
casey
last
term
that
in
due
process
and
equal
protection
claims,
which
are,
after
all,
the
heart
of
1983
and
the
heart
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
what...
which...
which
it
was
enforcing
these
kinds
of
claims,
often
there
is
a
lag
time
between
the
actual
injury
and
the
time
that
the
person
who
has
been
injured
recognizes
that
he
has
a
constitutional
claim.
that's
just
not
consistent
with
what
new
york
feels
about
its
intentional
torts.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
i...
i
don't
think,
one,
you
have
to
reach
that
question,
but
yes,
they
are
inadequate
in
our
view.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
i
don't
think
you
have
to
reach
that
question.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--[inaudible].
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
i...
i
think
that
there
is
a
three-step
process--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--yes.
yes,
it
is.
by
that
i
mean
under
section
1988,
which
is
the
section
that
you
use
to
choose
the
appropriate
state
statute
of
limitations,
the
third
step
is
whether
or
not
the
particular
state
statute,
if
it's
the
most
analogous
and
the
most
appropriate,
is
consistent
with
federal
law.
and
it's
our
position
that
a
one-year
statute
would
be
inconsistent
with
federal
law.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
that's
correct,
and
i
think
that's
why
it
is
inconsistent
with
1983.
section
1986
was
the
sherman
amendment.
that
was
the
most
controversial
element
of
18...
of
the
1871
legislation.
that's
the
provision
that
everybody
was
debating
and
fighting
over,
and
it
was
the
subject
of
numerous
compromises.
that
bill,
the
sherman
amendment,
went
back
to
conference
twice,
and
it
was
only
coming
out
of
the
conference,
the
joint
conference,
the
second
time
that
it
had
this
one-year
provision.
at
that
time,
if
you
had
looked
at
the
action
on
the
case,
statutes
of
limitations,
which
were
the
ones
that
congress
said
should
be
the
form
of
action,
every
state
i
think
except
four
had
more
than
one
year
as
a
statute
of
limitations.
therefore,
it
was
clearly
a
restricting
provision
as
the
other
amendments
to
the
sherman
amendment
were
restricting
provisions.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
that's
our...
our
position
is
that...
that...
that
it's
inappropriate
and
inconsistent
to
choose
the
one-year
statute
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
obviously,
our
position
is
whatever
you
choose,
we
win.
i
think
that's
the...
but
if
we
choose
that,
i
don't
think
not
on
a...
on
a...
on
a
cynical
basis,
but
i
think
on
a...
on
a
very
consistent
basis,
that
one
year
simply
doesn't
take
into
account
the
practicalities
and
the
purposes
underlying
section
1983.
and
going
back
to--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--i'm
sorry.
i
don't
understand
your
question.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
that's
right.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
so,
in
some
subsequent
cases,
you
may
be
faced
with
the
question
as
to
whether
one
year
is
long
enough.
and
you'll
have
to
reach
that
question
in
those
cases,
but
you
don't
have
to
reach
it
here
if
you
decide
that
the
general
remedy
for
personal
injury
claims
is...
is
the
appropriate
one.
but--
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
--no,
not
at
all.
i
think...
i
think
that...
that
you've
gone
far
down
the
road
to
certainty
and
uniformity.
yes,
there
may
be
subsequent
questions
as
to
whether
or
not
a
one-year
provision
is
consistent
or
not.
we
know
that...
that
in
new
york
the
court
of
appeals
held
in
1981
that
anything
less
than
two
years
would
not
be
consistent
and
based
that
two-year
cutoff
on
the
fact
that
the
federal
tort
claims
act
provides
that
in
two
years
you
have...
you
have
two
years
to
file
an
administrative
charge.
it
would
certainly
be...
to
my
mind,
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
say
to
somebody,
if
you
get
hit
by
a
mail
truck,
you
have
two
years
to
file
an
administrative
charge.
but
if
your
first
amendment
rights
are
violated,
that
claim
gets
extinguished
in
one
year.
that
doesn't
make
sense.
that's
inconsistent
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
kenneth
kimerling
i...
i...
i
researched
some
of
them,
and
i
didn't
try
to
figure
out
which
ones...
they
went...
depending
on
who
introduced
them,
they
were
short
or
long.
and
i
don't
have
to
tell
you
the
names.
but
they
came
out
of
the
senate
judiciary.
but
the...
the...
the...
the...
the
one-year
provision
i
think
the
fact
that
it
was
attached
to
section
1986,
the
most
controversial
provision
of
this
legislation,
one
in
which
the
sponsor
of
that
legislation,
senator
thurmond
and
his
chief
opponent,
senator
thurmond,
both
concurred
after
it
had
gone
through
this
amendment
process,
one
of
which
was
the
attachment
of
this
truncated
statutory
period,
that
it
wasn't
worth
the
paper
it's
written
on.
and
if
you
look
probably
back
in...
in...
in
the
annotations,
there
are
very,
very
few
1986
cases
ever
been
brought.
and
i
think
there's
substantial
basis
to
reject
it,
but
again
i
don't
think
you
have
to
reach
that
question
here,
obviously,
because
here
you
have
a
choice.
and
the
choice
is
between
a
general
personal
injury
provision
and
a
specified
intentional
tort
provision.
and
i
think
the
guidance
that
this
court
provided
in
wilson
was
to
choose
the
one
that
generally
covered
personal
injuries.
after
all,
we're
not
just
talking
about
one
type
of
constitutional
claim.
we're
talking
about
a
broad
range
of
claims
that...
that
are
covered
by
1983.
the
previous
case,
the
texas
monthly
case...
what
kind
of
intentional
tort
is
involved
there?
the...
the...
to...
to
try
to
pin
that
down
to,
as
justice
scalia
suggested,
to
assault
and
battery
makes
no
sense,
but
to
try
to
say
that
it
covers
personal
injury
generally
i
think
makes
a
lot
of
sense
and
it...
and
it
does
accomplish
primarily
what
this
court
sought
to
accomplish
in
wilson
v.
garcia
which
was
to
put
an
end
to
this
litigation
by
giving
some
uniformity
and
some
certainty
to
that
decision,
a
uniformity
and
certainty
that's
consistent
with
the
purposes
of
1983
and
consistent
with
the
legislative
history.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
thank
you
for
your
attention.
