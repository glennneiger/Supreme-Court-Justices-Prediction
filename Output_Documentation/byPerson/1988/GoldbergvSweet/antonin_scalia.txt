why...
why
is
it
you
say
that
they
levy
it
on
the
whole
of
the...
of
the
service?
the
initial
obstacle
i
confront
is
i
don't
see
how
this
is
different
from
any
sales
tax,
let's
say,
on
a
piece
of
tangible
goods
that...
that
is
manufactured
in
a
number
of
other
states.
the
raw
materials
come
from...
from
iowa.
the
manufacturing
is
done
is
ohio,
and
whatnot.
yet,
the
whole
value
that
has
been
added
to
that
item
that's
sold
is
taxed
by
the
state
that
imposes
a
sales
tax.
why
can't
you
say
that...
that
that
also
taxes
activities
in
other
states?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
smith,
i...
i
don't
understand
the
whole
need
for
apportionment.
we've
required
apportionment
where...
where
what
you're
taxing
is
the
net
income
of
a...
of
a
unitary
business
because
there
if
you...
if...
there's
only
100
percent
of
the
net
income,
and
if
you
allow
every...
every
state
to
assume
a
different
percentage
attributable
to
that
state,
you
end
up
taxing
more
than
the
whole.
but
i'm
not
aware
that
we've
required
apportionment
where
what
is
being
taxed
is
not
a...
a
single
event,
but
two
separate
events.
for
example,
we
allow
one
state
to
impose
a
sales
tax
and
another
state
to
impose
a
use
tax.
we
don't...
we
don't...
they're
taxing
two
separate
things.
one
is
taxing
the
sale;
the
other
is
taxing
the
use.
and
there's
no
constitutional
requirement
that...
that
one
give
a
credit
for
the
other.
we've
explicitly
said
that
there's
no
such
requirement.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that
different
from
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
we
have
to
regard
it
that
way?
why
can't
we
regard
the
tax
as
a
tax
on
the
placing
or
receiving
of
a
phone
call
in...
in
illinois,
and
another
state
can
place
a
tax
on
the...
on
the
placing
or
receiving
of
a
phone
call
in
that
state?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
how
they
measure
the
tax.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
as
in
the
sales
and
use
tax
situation.
you
tax
the
value
of
the
thing
once
when
it's
sold
and
another
time
when
it's
used.
so
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
here
only
one
jurisdiction
is
taxing
the
receipt,
and
only
one
jurisdiction
will
be
taxing
the
placement.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
therefore
does
not
follow.
it's
simply
not
true
that
the
price
of
an
interstate
phone
call
always
varies
according
to
its
distance,
is
it?
that's
just
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--[inaudible]
true
it
would
be
automatically
discriminatory.
you
could
say
you're
discriminating
on
the
basis
of
distance.
but
it's
not
always
true.
sometimes
a
shorter
call
may
cost
more
than--
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
don't
even
think
we
require
a
rough
approximation.
we...
we
have...
we
have
cases
that...
that...
that
measure
the
validity
of
a
tax
on
the
basis
of
whether
the
thing
would
be
overtaxed
if
other
states
adopted
the
same
kind
of
tax,
a
reciprocity
requirement
imagining
would
the
thing
be
fairly
taxed
if
another
state
had
the
same
kind
of
law.
but
we
have
never
required
the
other
states
to
have
the
same
kind
of
law
so
that
in
theory,
other
states
could
adopt
quite
different
laws
and
tax
the
thing
quite
unfairly.
we've
never
required
anything
resembling
actual
equity
or
even
approximate
equity
in
taxation.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
it's
the
same
price
as
the
ordinary
sales
tax
because
a
certain
portion
of
the
price
of
any
tangible
goods
has
to
be
attributable
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
the
transportation
of
those
goods
from
elsewhere.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
every
sales
tax
has
that
effect.
justice
antonin
scalia
have
we
ever
applied
that...
that
requirement
to
a
sales
tax?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
we
regarded
this
as
a
sales
tax,
we
wouldn't
even
have
to
confront
that
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
assuming
what
you
have
just
said
is
true,
assuming
everybody
adopts
the
same
scheme,
right,
as
illinois?
is...
is
that...
is
that
a
likelihood?
