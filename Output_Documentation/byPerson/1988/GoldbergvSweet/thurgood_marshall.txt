justice
thurgood
marshall
the
other
case,
goldberg
versus
sweet,
no.
87-1101,
is
appealed
from
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
this
case,
we
hold
that
the
illinois
telecommunications
excise
tax
does
not
violate
the
dormant
commerce
clause
and
challenge
tax
on
interstate
telecommunications
is
falsely
apportioned.
it
does
not
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce.
it
is
fairly
related
to
services
and
benefits
produced
by
the
state
of
illinois.
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
is,
thereby,
affirmed.
justice
stevens
and
justice
o?connor
have
each
filed
separate
concurring
opinions,
and
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
