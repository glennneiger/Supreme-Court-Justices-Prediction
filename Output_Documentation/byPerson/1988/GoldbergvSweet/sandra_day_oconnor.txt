well,
mr.
smith,
to
get
back
to
justice
scalia's
question,
do
you
think
illinois
could
have
imposed
a
gross
receipts
tax
on
all
of
the
charges
charged
in
illinois
on
the
call--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
totality
of
the
charge?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
don't
you
think
under
our
precedents,
under
sales
tax
generally,
that
a
tax
imposed
by
illinois
on
the
totality
of
the
charge
would
be
upheld?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
told
the
credit
provision
only
applies
if
the
same
taxpayer
is
asked
to
pay
twice.
so,
it
can...
it
can
result
in
calls
being
taxed
in
full
by
the
receiving
state
and
the
state
of
origin
if
paid
by
different
people.
