mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
just
want
to
be
sure
that
the
court
understands
the
operation
of
the
tax.
and
i
think
from
hearing
my
adversary's
argument,
i
think
the
court
does,
but
just
to
be
absolutely
certain.
first
of
all,
i
think
it's
important
that
the
tax
is
not
facially
discriminatory
between
interstate
and
intrastate
transactions;
that
is,
the
same
tax
rate
is
applied
to
either
kind
of
call.
the
question
here
is
whether
it
is
somehow
discriminatory
or
unlawful
in
its
operation.
now,
while
section
4
of
the
statute
says
a
tax
is
imposed
on
the
act
or
privilege
of
originating
in
this
state
or
receiving
in
this
state
interstate
telecommunications...
and
it's
measured
by
5
percent
of
the
gross
charge
for
such
a
communication.
gross
charge
is
defined
as
the
amount
paid
for
a
call
charged
to
an
illinois
service
address.
so,
in
other
words,
of
the
universe
of
calls...
let's
take
the
typical
two-party
call...
it
could
be
charged
either
to
the
non-illinois
party
or
to
the
illinois
party.
illinois
taxes
it
only
if
it
is
charged
to
the
illinois
party.
it
does
not
tax
it
if
it's
charged
to
the
non-illinois
party.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
you
mean
charges
to
his
florida
number?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it's
clearly
not
taxed
by
illinois.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
definitely
not
taxed.
on
the
other
hand,
if
an
illinois
purchaser,
while
he's
in
florida,
calls
somebody
in
illinois,
charges
it
to
his
illinois
number,
that
would
be
taxed
even
though
the
call
was
placed
if
the
purchaser
was
outside
illinois
when
he
placed
the
call.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
not
taxed.
there
have
to
be
two
things.
there
has
to
be
an
illinois
party
to
the
call,
and
it
has
to
be
charged
to
the
service
address
of
an
illinois
purchaser.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
statute
expressly
says
that
it's
irrelevant
where
it's
billed
or
paid.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
and
gte
makes
a
lot
of
the
fact
that
it
can
be
billed
or
paid
someplace
else,
and
that
that
means
it's
not
an
illinois
sale,
which
is
obviously
i
think
not
the
case.
if
you
walk
into
garfinkel's
and
buy
a
suit
and
you're
a
resident
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
you
say
send
the
bill
to
my
father
in
chicago,
that
doesn't
mean
the
district
of
columbia
can't
impose
a
sales
tax
on
it.
now,
there's
no
challenge
here
to
illinois'
nexus.
so,
i
will
pass
on
from
that
to
the
question
of
apportionment.
and
i
think
that
the
appellants
forget
conveniently
what
the
purpose
is
of
requiring
apportionment.
the
purpose
is
that
when
the
state
taxes
an
activity
that
occurs
in
more
than
one
state,
some
measure
is
needed
to
ensure
that
the
state
is
taking
only
its
fair
share
of
the
pie.
and
this
is
required
by
due
process
type
nexus
requirements
because
if
the
state
taxes
something
that
is
occurring
in
another
state,
there
may
be
a
nexus
problem.
now,
the
classical
situations
where
apportionment
has
been
required
are,
for
example,
in
the
case
of
a
net
income
tax
on
the
operations
of
a
unitary
multistate
business
or
a
property
tax
on
movable
property,
such
as
railroad
cars,
which
is
used
in
a
number
of
different
states.
in
those
circumstances,
the
pie
that
is
being
taxed...
that
is,
the
tax
base
to
which
the
tax
is
being
applied...
is
activity
occurring
in
multiple
states.
that
pie
has
to
be
sliced
so
that
the
taxing
state
gets
only
its
fair
share,
and
normally
apportionment
is
the
method
that
is
used
to
do
that.
now,
this
tax
fully
satisfies
that
objective
because
the
pie
that
is
being
sliced
here
at
all
interstate
calls
between
a
party
in
illinois
and
a
party
outside
illinois.
and
the
way
illinois
has
sliced
this
pie...
and
i
do
not
understand
my
friend's
suggestion
that
the
legislature
didn't
make
clear
what
it
was
doing
because
i
think
justice
stevens
is
completely
right.
the
statute
does
what
it
does,
and
what
it
does
is
to
slice
the
pie
by
taxing
calls
charged
to
an
illinois
number
and
not
taxing
calls
charged
to
a
non-illinois
number.
now,
i
don't
know
whether
you
call
this
apportionment
or
you
don't
call
it
apportionment.
but
what
you
do
call
it
is
something
that
fully
satisfies
the
commerce
clause
purpose
of
apportionment.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
that
fundamental
fallacy.
now,
let
me
come
back
to
a
point
that
was
involved
in
justice
scalia's
first
question
because
there
are
sort
of
two
different
ways
you
can
look
at
this
tax.
we
argue
that,
first
of
all,
you
can
look
at
it
as
being
like
a
sales
tax
on
the
purchase
of
an
interstate
telephone
service
in
illinois
or
like
a
gross
receipts
tax
on
the
revenues
from
interstate
carriers
doing
business
in
illinois.
now,
i
am
told,
of
course,
that
that
is
not
what
this
tax
is
because
the
illinois
court
said
it's
actually
a
tax
on
the
interstate
phone
call.
but
this
court
has
made
crystal
clear
in
numerous
cases
that
if
the
tax
is
exactly
equal
in
its
operation
to
some
other
kind
of
clearly
lawful
tax...
and
that's
exactly
what
was
involved
in
moorman...
it
will
be
upheld;
that
is,
you
will
look
at
the
economic
substance
of
the
tax.
now,
what
is
the
economic
substance
of
this
tax?
the
substance
is
that
the
illinois
purchaser
who
purchases
a
phone
call
pays
a
tax
of
5
percent
of
the
cost
of
that
purchase
charged
to
his
illinois
service
address.
it
sounds
a
lot
like
a
sales
tax
for
me...
to
me,
and
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
fact
that
it
is
not
technically
a
sales
tax
is
an
effort
to
throw
this
court
back
to
the
era
of
hyper-technical
formalism
that
existed
before
complete
auto.
in
economic
substance
it
is
something
that
happens...
what
is
being
taxed
is
exactly
like
a
sales
tax.
it
is
also
exactly
like
a
gross
receipts
tax;
that
is,
the
amount
of
tax
that
illinois
collects
is
exactly
the
same
as
if
illinois
said
we
will
tax
interstate
carriers
on
their
gross
receipts
from
interstate
phone
calls
and
we
will
measure
that
tax
by
the
unapportioned
gross
receipts
that
they
receive
in
illinois.
unapportioned
gross
receipts
taxes
have
been
repeatedly
upheld
by
this
court.
they
were
upheld
in
standard
pressed
steel.
moorman
said
they
were
good.
tyler
pipe
two
years
ago
said
they
were
good.
i
know
that
in
moorman,
justice
brennan
in
his
dissent
questioned
the
propriety
of
unapportioned
gross
receipts
taxes,
but
in
moorman,
the
unapportioned
gross
receipts
tax
presented
a
problem
of
iowa
taking
too
big
a
share
of
the
pie,
which
i
hope
to
demonstrate
momentarily
does
not
exist
in
this
case.
so,
i
think
even
if
you
didn't
approve
of
unapportioned
gross
receipts
taxes
on
most
interstate
sales,
they're
perfectly
all
right
in
the
telephone
context.
now,
the
appellants
have
argued
that
a
gross
receipts
tax
is
different
from
a
tax
on
the
phone
call
because
the
incidence
of
this
tax
falls
on
the
retail
customer
rather
than
on
the
carrier.
but
in
economic
substance,
i
think
it's
generally
recognized
and
i
think
it's
obvious
that
a
gross
receipts
tax
has
the
same
economic
effect
as
a
sales
tax.
it's
different
in
form,
but
not
in
substance.
it
has
the
same
economic
effect
because
the
cost
to
the
purchaser
of
purchasing
the
taxed
service
will
be
the
same.
in
the
case
of
a
gross
receipts
tax,
the
tax
will
not
be
separately
stated,
but
it
will
obviously
be
incorporated
in
the
price
of
the
good
or
service
that
is
sold.
now,
even
if
you
view
it
as
a
tax
on
the
interstate
phone
call
themselves,
which
we
agree
one
or
more
states...
other
states
would
have
nexus
to
tax
depending
on
where
the
other
parties,
the
non-illinois
parties
are
located...
the
illinois
scheme
fully
satisfies
apportionment
objectives.
and...
and
i
think
i
would
agree
that
in
the
absence
of
a
credit,
if
illinois
tried
to
tax
100
percent
of
all
calls
to
which
an
illinois
party
is
a
party,
there
would
be
a
serious
problem
under
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
there
would
be
a
serious
problem
because
that
tax
would
not
pass
the
internal
consistency
test
because--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--there
would
be
the...
at
least
the
potential
for
double
taxation,
and
there
would
be
actual
double
taxation
with
many
other
states.
that
is,
it
seems
to
me
it
is
critically
different...
critical
to
this
case
that
illinois
is
not
attempting
to
tax
every
call
on
the
full
amount
of
the
call.
if
it
did
that,
i
believe
there
would
be
a
problem.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
don't
think...
i
don't
think
there's
a
problem,
and
i
will
get
in
a
moment
to
why
i
don't
think
there
is
any
problem
at
all
even
though
you
could
hypothesize
a
particular
phone
call
that
might
be
taxed
twice.
i
don't
think
that
causes
a
problem.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
credit
would
cure
it
anyway.
the
credit
cures
several
problems
although
i
have
to
say
that...
that
i
am
confident
that
this
tax
is
valid
even
if
it
did
not
have
a
credit
provision.
i
do
not
think
we
depend
at
all
on
the
credit
provision.
but
to
the
extent
there
is
any
residual
argument
left
that
some
individual
taxpayer
might
find
itself
in
the
position
of
paying
double
taxes
somewhere,
the
credit
provision
does
take
care
of
it.
so,
i
think
the
credit
provision
is
a
kind
of
insurance
that
is
not
needed,
but
that
is
present.
now--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--it
could,
and
i
don't
think
that
would
be
a
problem
for
reasons
i'll
get
to.
but
the
credit
provision
in
that
respect
is
the
same
as
the
louisiana
credit
provision
involved
in
holmes,
which
i
believe
also
applied
only
if
the
taxpayer
had
paid
a
tax
outside
the
state.
yet,
the
court
found
it
satisfactory
to
deal
with
apportionment
requirements.
i
don't
find
it
as
intellectually
satisfying
as
our
other
arguments,
but
i
think
the
precedent
clearly
suggests
that
it's
there.
and
it
does
serve
a
purpose
of
guarding
against
multiple
taxation
by...
to
the
individual,
particular
taxpayer.
i
think
the
court
should
appreciate
how
inconsistent
the
appellants'
arguments
are
because
they
start
off
by
saying
you
can't
treat
this
like
a
sales
tax;
that
is,
you
can't
look
only
at
the
transactions
that
are
sold
in
illinois
because
the
illinois
supreme
court
said
it's
a
tax
on
the
interstate
phone
calls,
not
a
tax
on
the
sales.
so,
you
have...
and
the
interstate
phone
call,
after
all,
consists
of
calls
that
could
be
taxed
by
either
state.
so,
you
have
to
look
at
the
universe
of
calls
that
could
be
taxed
by
either
state.
and
we
say,
fine,
look
at
the
universe
of
calls
that
could
be
taxed
by
either
state.
observe
that
only
half
of
those
calls
are
taxed
by
illinois.
so,
where's
the
problem?
and
they
say,
oh,
no,
you
can't
do
that.
when
you
look
at
the
calls
that
are...
the
interstate
calls
that
are
taxed,
you
must
look
only
at
the
ones
that
are
sold
in
illinois.
and
then
you
find
that
those
are
taxed
100
percent,
to
which
i
say,
well,
then
what's
wrong
with
treating
this
as
a
sales
tax.
they
have
really
tried
to
pull
a
little
shell
game
on
the
court
i
believe.
now--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i'm...
scheiner
is
one
of
my
very
favorite
cases.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
i
can't
say
that
i'm...
that
i
understand
what
it
is
that
he
is
referring
to
in
scheiner.
in
scheiner,
the
problem
was
that
the
structure
of
the
tax
inherently
and
in
empirical
experience
as
well
discriminated
by
causing
the
out-of-state
business
to
pay
more
tax...
and
remember,
scheiner
was
a
use
tax
for
the
use
of
the
state's
roads...
than
the
in-state
operator
had
to
pay.
i'll
note
parenthetically
that
the
objection
in
this
tax
is...
and
this
is
a
little...
perhaps
a
little
bit
complicated
to
understand,
but
the
objection
is
that
the
illinois
caller
is
being
discriminated
against.
it's
the
illinois
caller
who's
paying
the
tax
on
the
full
call.
the
person
in
nevada
who
makes
a
call
to
illinois
and
charges
it
to
his
nevada
number
is
getting
the
benefit
of
the
fact
that
illinois
is
not
trying
to
tax
that
call.
so,
this
is
a
rather
odd
commerce
clause
claim
because
the
in-state
people
are
the
victims
of
this
discrimination
and
the
out-of-state
people
are
the
beneficiaries
of
this
discrimination.
i'm
not
sure
that
the
commerce
clause
reaches
that
situation.
but
when
you're
talking
about
apportionment--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--they
represent
residents
of
illinois.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
gte
is
a
carrier.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
the
incidence
of
the
tax
we
are
told...
we
are
told
we
can't
look
at
this
as
a
gross
receipts
tax
on
gte.
it's
sort
of
standing
in
for
its
customers
because
it
paid
their
tax.
now,
the
customers
are
all
illinois
residents,
illinois
businesses,
and
they're
saying
they
paid
to
illinois--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--let
me...
let
me
say--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
mean,
that
is
true,
but
i
guess
there
are
several
things
to
be
said
about
that.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
all
right.
and
there
are
several
things
to
be
said
about
that.
one
is
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
apportionment.
if
you
apportioned
the
tax
by
taxing
only
half
of
the
call,
this
objection
would
still
exist
exactly
the
same.
so,
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
apportionment
issue.
it's
a
totally
separate
issue.
now,
it
is,
it
seems
to
me,
completely
indistinguishable
from
a
sales
tax;
that
is,
what
they
are
suggesting...
well,
first
they
suggest
that
it's
unrelated
to
the
services
that
illinois
provides
to
the
telephone
caller.
and
commonwealth
edison,
if
it
made
one
thing
clear,
was
that
the
relationship
didn't
have
to
be
to
the
services
but
to
the
in-state
activity
of
the
taxpayer.
now,
what
is
a
better
way
to
measure
the
in-state
activity
of
making
an
interstate
phone
call
than
the
value...
than
the
price
that
the
taxpayer
is
willing
to
pay
for
the
phone
call?
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
a
completely
fair
way
and
that
the
court
should
not
set
foot
upon
the
path
of
suggesting
that
you
could
not
measure
the
tax
that
a
state
can
impose
on
a
transaction
by
the
amount
that
the
taxpayer
paid
for
the
tax
transaction.
i
think
you
will
find
yourselves
quickly
in
a
quagmire
if
you
start
out
in
that
direction.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it's
the
point
you
made
in
your--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--right.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
i
mean,
as
we
said
in
our
brief
i
believe,
if...
if...
if
there
are
two
cars
manufactured
in
michigan
and
brought
into
illinois
to
the
same
showroom
and
sold,
and
one
is
a
cadillac
and
one
is
a
chevrolet,
and
the
cadillac
costs
twice
as
much,
the
state
of
illinois
has
done
exactly
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
both
of
those
cars.
yet,
it
unquestioned
that
it
can
tax
twice
as
much
for
the
more
expensive
one.
i
don't...
i
would
rather...
although
if
there
are
more
questions
about
fair
relation,
i'll
be
happy
to
talk
about
them,
but
i
think
the
main
thrust
of
the
appellants'
argument
is
in
the
apportionment
area.
i
think
there's
a
fundamental
point
about
apportionment,
and
the
court
made
this
point
in
the
container
corp.
case
quite
clearly.
there
are
two
requirements
to
satisfy
yourself
that
the
state
is
getting
a
fair
share
of
the
total
taxes.
the
first
is
what's
known
as
internal
consistency.
now,
internal
consistency
is
a
logical
requirement
that
you
determine
by
looking
at
the
structure
of
the
tax,
and
what
you
ask
yourself
is
whether...
if
this
formula
were
applied
by
every
jurisdiction,
would
it
result
in
more
than
all
of
the
interstate
transactions
being
taxed.
it
is
crystal
clear
that
the
illinois
tax
passes
internal
consistency.
the
only
argument
i've
seen
to
suggest
otherwise
is
gte's
argument
that
if
other
states
had
different
taxes
and
you
put
them
together
with
the
illinois
tax,
there
might
be
a
possibility
of
multiple
taxation.
but,
of
course,
that
would
make
no
tax
pass
internal
consistency.
that
is,
it
totally
defeats
the
purpose
of
the
internal
consistency
inquiry.
now,
the
internal
consistency
inquiry
is
very
important
because
it
means
that
the
tax
looked
at
on
its
own
terms
does
not
carry
with
it
any
inherent
risk
of
multiple
taxation
of
interstate
transactions.
scheiner
of
course,
was
totally
different
in
that
regard.
now,
there
is
a
second
requirement,
and
that
has
been
called
external
consistency.
and
what
external
consistency
means...
and
i'm
quoting
from
container
corp.
where
it
was
called
the
more
difficult
requirement...
is
that
"the
factor
or
factors
used
in
the
apportionment
formula
must
actually
reflect
a
reasonable
sense
of
how
income
is
generated.
"
that
is,
when
you
look
at
the
way
the
pie
has
been
sliced,
you
must
ask
yourself
whether
the
state
has
taken
a
slice
that
reasonably
reflects
the
in-state
component
of
the
interstate
activity
being
taxed.
but
the
court
is
very
hands-off
in
applying
external
consistency;
that
is,
the
court
has
made
clear
that
what
you
need
is
a
method
of
allocation
or
attribution
to
the
state
that
is...
and
i
quote...
"out
of
all
appropriate
proportion,
or
that
leads
to
grossly
distorted
results,
or
that
is
outrageous
in
its
application.
"
now,
i
defy
anybody
to
say
that
taxing
50
percent
of
the
interstate
two-party
calls,
to
take
our
simple
hypothetical,
could
possibly
fit
that.
there's
another
important
point
about
container
corp.
and
it--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--you've
never...
a
sales
tax
is
an
unapportioned
tax.
now,
in
other
words,
you...
you
would
not...
you
would
not
apply
it
to
a
sales
tax.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
you
would
not
have
to
confront
that
problem.
but...
but
i
am
taking
the
appellants
on
their
own
terms
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument
and
suggesting
that
you
might
choose
to
regard
it,
as
they
insist
you
must,
as
a
tax
on
the
interstate
telephone
call
itself
which
i
agree
to.
two
states
have
nexus
to
tax.
now,
but
i
wanted
to
make
another
point
about
container
corp.
which
is
overlooked
i
think
by
mr.
smith
in
his
argument.
he...
he
says,
well,
we
don't...
how
do
we
know
whether
half
of
the
calls
are
likely
to
be
charged
to
the
illinois
caller
and
half
to
the
non-illinois
party.
well,
first
of
all,
i
think
we
know
that
from
common
sense
it's
probably
generally
going
to
be
the
case.
but
in
any
event,
what
is
clear
is
that
this
factual
question...
this
is
a
question
about
whether
external
consistency
is
satisfied,
not
internal
consistency.
and
in
container
corp.,
the
court
said
unequivocally
the
appellant
has
the
burden
of
proof.
and
there
is
not
one
iota
of
evidence
in
the
record
in
this
case...
there's
no
attempt
to
prove
that
the
tax
doesn't
pass
internal
consistency.
there
is
only
an
attempt
to
force
the
court
to
take
this
narrow
focus
and
look
only
at
the
calls
that
are
actually
taxed,
but
at
the
same
time
not
treat
it
as
a
sales
tax
or
a
gross
receipts
tax.
now,
let
me
turn
to
something
else
because
the
scheiner
case
i
think
is
quite
helpful
to
us
in
a
number
of
respects,
and
one
of
the
respects
in
which
it's
helpful
is
that
it
recognizes
that
where
it
is
administratively
difficult
or
impossible
to
tax
a
transaction
appropriately
by
a
non-discriminatory
tax,
maybe
a
discriminatory
tax
would
be
permissible.
now,
i
don't
for
a
minute
agree
that
this
is
in
the
least
a
discriminatory
tax,
but
any
scheme
of
call-by-call
apportionment
of
the
kind
that
the
appellants
suggest
is
either
unconstitutional
or
wholly
unworkable.
now,
let
me
quickly
run
through
the
possibilities.
if
you're
going
to
apportion
an
individual
call,
you
can
apportion
it,
it
seems
to
me,
either...
let's
take,
first,
the
possibility
that
you
look
on
the
basis
of
mileage,
which
has
been
suggested
in
their
briefs,
and
each
state
gets
to
tax
the
share
that
represents
the
miles
through
that
state
that
a
straight-line
signal
between
the
two
points
would
pass.
i
think
it's
clear
from
mci's
brief
and
from
what
anybody
knows
about
the
telephone
business,
that
this
is
impossible.
there
is
no
record
of
the
signals.
there
is
no
way
to
determine
which
intervening
states
are
involved.
i
question
whether
an
intervening
state
would
have
nexus
simply
because
the
signal
passed
through
its
borders
or
even
touched
a
microwave
relay
tower
that's
within
its
borders,
which
the
state
ought
to
tax
through
a
property
tax
it
seems
to
me.
but
even
if
you
could
determine
this,
it
would
be
a
nightmare
to
administer
on
a
call-by-call
basis
that
kind
of
apportionment.
and
i...
and
i
think
the
appellants
have
essentially
receded
from
the
suggestion
that
that
should
be
done.
now,
there
is
a
second
possibility
which
is
that
you
can
impose...
and
this
is
the...
the
only
thing
that
they
have
alleged
they
have
the
technological
capacity
to
do.
if
i'm
in
illinois
and
i
call
someone
in
california,
they
have
suggested
that
when
they
send
me
the
bill,
they...
they
have
the
capacity
to
tax
half
of
that
call...
to
impose
the
illinois
tax
on
half
of
that
call,
the
california
tax
on
half
of
that
call.
so,
they
would...
i'm
in
illinois.
they
would
bill
me
for
the
california
tax
and
the
illinois
tax.
they
have
the
technological
capacity
to
do
that,
but
i
have
two
observations.
first
of
all,
that's
unconstitutional
unless
you're
going
to
overrule
national
bellas
hess.
that
is,
i
do
not
have
nexus
with
california.
california
cannot
tax
me
simply
because
i
make
a
phone
call
from
outside
california
into
california.
indeed,
it
can't
tax
me
if
i
conduct
a
mail
order
business
with
extensive
advertising
and
so
on
as
long
as
i
don't
have
a
physical
presence
in
california.
and
the
second
observation
is
to
what
end
are
we
going
through
this
exercise
when
it
is
essentially
going
to
end
up
in
the
state's
getting
the
same
amount
of
tax
dollars
and
the
generality
of
taxpayers
paying
the
same
amount
of
tax
dollars.
and
i
might
mention
that
neither
mr.
goldberg
nor
mr.
mctigue
has
suggested
that
they
have
paid
a
penny
more
in
tax
than
they
would
pay
under
any
one
of
their
apportionment
schemes
except--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--no,
i
don't...
i
don't
care...
let
me...
let
me
get
to
that
because
that
is
a
point
that
has
come
up
several
times.
first
of
all,
essentially
nobody
has
inconsistent
schemes.
this
wheat
ridge,
colorado
scheme
that
was
mentioned
in
the
illinois
supreme
court
is
itself
not
internally
consistent
and,
therefore,
probably
unconstitutional.
and
certainly
the
illinois
tax
can't
fall
because
some
other
tax
is...
is
unconstitutional.
but
beyond
that,
let's
postulate
the
situation
in
which
a
state
takes
into
its
head
for
some
reason
to
tax
the
party
who...
who
doesn't
pay
for
the
call.
so,
california
says
we're
going
to
tax
the
party
who
doesn't.
if
somebody
in
california
doesn't
pay
for
the
call,
we'll
tax
them.
i
wanted
to
make
the
point
that
that
is
administratively
impossible
because
there's
no
way
of
identifying
who
such
a
person
is.
even
if...
even
if
that
were
possible
and
california
did
it,
the
result
would
be
that...
that
it
would
be
an
advantage...
an
advantage...
to
interstate
commerce,
not
a
disadvantage
because
if
the
call
was
billed
in
california,
nobody
would
pay
any
tax.
the
tax
would
be
zero.
if
the
call
was
billed
in
illinois,
the
tax
would
be
on
200
percent.
that
would
still
even
out
so
that
the
generality
of
taxpayers
would
be
paying
a
tax
on
100
percent.
but
people
who
are
in
interstate
commerce...
if
i
am
calling
my
branch
office
in
california,
i
have
the
choice
to
charge
the
call
in
a
way
that
reduces
my
tax
down
to
zero
in
that
situation.
so,
i
don't
see
how
the
commerce
clause
can
be
violated
when
these
various
schemes
actually
provide
an
advantage
to
interstate
callers
who...
who
would
want
to
arrange
their
affairs
to
avoid
the
tax
and
for
the
generality
a
caller
would
wash
out
in
the
end.
now...
now,
suppose
some
person
came
along
and
said,
you
know,
the
only
long
distance
calls
i
make
are
to
my
grandchildren
and
i
charge
them
all
to
my
phone
and
the
result
is
that
i'm
paying
more
than
my
fair
share
of
tax.
i
guess
i
have
several
observations
about
that,
and
i
know
my
time
is
running
out.
so,
i...
i...
i
want
to
remind
the
court
of
something
that
it
said
in
moorman.
and
maybe
this
is
back
on
this...
on
this
question
of
different
tax
schemes
producing
multiple
burdens.
in
footnote
12
in
moorman,
the
court
was
concerned
with
whether
the
iowa
scheme
created
multiple
tax
burdens
when
it
was
juxtaposed
with
the
illinois
scheme.
and
the
court
said
the
simple
answer
is
that
whatever
disparity
may
have
existed
by
these
inconsistent
statutes
is
not
attributable
to
the
iowa
statute
which
treats
both
local
and
foreign
concerns
with
even
hand.
the
disparity
can
only
be
the
consequence
of
the
combined
effect
of
the
iowa
and
illinois
statutes,
and
iowa
is
not
responsible
for
the
latter.
thus,
appellant's
discrimination
claim
is
simply
a
way
of
describing
the
potential
consequences
of
the
use
of
different
formulas
by
two
states.
now,
what
could
be
more
apt
to
the
situation
that
is
being
postulated
here?
now,
let
me
come
back
to
the
person
who
says
i
only
call
my
grandchildren.
first
of
all,
it's
not
clear
that
at
the
joints...
the
play
at
the
joints
doesn't
just
subject
him
to
the
tax
consequences.
you
don't
declare
a
statute
unconstitutional
for
that.
secondly,
there's
no
showing
that
anybody
has
ever
paid
actual
multiple
taxes.
and
with
respect
to
the
possibility
that
potentially
such
a
person
would
pay
tax
on
more
than
100
percent
of
the
calls
to
his
grandchildren,
there
is
the
credit
provision
available
if
that
should
happen,
if
he
should
be
so
foolish
as
to
arrange
his
calls
in
a
way
that
he
does
get
double-taxed.
so,
i
think
the
risk
of
multiple
tax
burdens
is
a
sham
in
this
case
as
well.
let...
let
me
close
with...
with
an
example
on
the
discrimination
point.
maybe
this
point
is
already
clear,
but
i'm
thinking
about
the
case...
i
thought
of...
if
you
had
two
toll
bridges,
one
between
manhattan
and
brooklyn
and
one
between
manhattan
and
new
jersey,
and
you
charged
a
dollar
when
you
got
on
the
bridge.
that
was
the
toll.
no
toll
when
you
got
off
the
bridge.
the
result
is
that
the
person
traveling
between
manhattan
and
brooklyn,
no
matter
which
direction
he
went
in,
would
have
to
pay
a
$1
toll.
a
person
traveling
between
manhattan
and
new
jersey
would
pay
a
$1
toll
when
he's
going
to
new
jersey,
but
returning
from
new
jersey,
new
york
would
collect
no
toll.
now,
if
i
understand
the
burden
of
my
opponent's
argument,
it
is
that
that
system
is
unfair
and
discriminatory
against
interstate
commerce,
that
you
must
apportion
the
toll
that
is
paid
on
the
trip
between
new
york
and
new
jersey.
you
must
disregard
the
fact
that
the
trip
in
the
other
direction
is
not
taxed
at
all.
now,
this
seems
to
me
the
height
of
formalism,
and
i
think
the
court
should
stay
far
away
from
it.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
thank
you.
