but
it...
but
it...
but...
but...
and
it...
and
it
taxes
it
even
though
it
happens
to
be
paid
in
another
state.
justice
byron

so,
a
gross
receipts
tax
would
not
cover
a
call
that
is
billed
to
an
illinois
number
but
sent
to
washington
and
is
paid
there.
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
forget
that
illinois
would
allow
the
credit
for
the
washington
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
doesn't
have
to
be
paid
by
anybody
by
that
address.
it
could
be
paid
from
someplace
out
of
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean...
you
mean
the
other...
if
another
state...
it
would
just
be...
what
you're
saying
is
it
would
be
double
taxation
of
the
same
call.
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
as
a...
so,
with
respect
to
the
washington
statute,
for
example,
you
think
the...
if
there's
a
problem,
the
credit
cures
it,
or
is
there
a
problem
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
say...
let's...
let's
suppose...
just
suppose
a
phone
call
like
that.
you
think
the
credit
would
cure
it
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
opponents
don't
represent
callers.
they
represent...
at
least
they're
people
who
are
operating
telephone
lines.
justice
byron
r.
white
well--
justice
byron
r.
white
--yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
part
of
the
argument
is
that
the...
is
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
how...
what
distance
the
interstate
call
covers,
and
the
longer
it
is,
the
less
connection
really
that
illinois
has
for
it.
and
the
in-state
people--
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
can
only
call
in-state
between
the
borders
of
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
carrier
says
i'm
carrying
this
call
from
china.
