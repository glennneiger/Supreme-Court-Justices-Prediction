it
seems
to
me
that
everything
you
have
said
so
far,
if
you
transfer
it
to
our
case
in
d.
h.
holmes
that
we
had
last
year
involving
the
catalogs,
means
that
we
were
wrong
in
reaching
the
decision
we
reached
in
the
catalog
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
transaction
takes
place
in
part
out
of
state.
there
is
very
significant
economic
activity
that's
outside
the
state.
and
yet,
we
sustained
a
tax
based
wholly
on
the
sales
price
in
the
state
of,
i
believe,
mississippi.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
it...
it
was
a
use
tax
based
on
the
value
of
the
catalogs.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
here
no
call
that's
not
billed
to
illinois
is
taxed.
mr....
is...
doesn't
the...
illinois
taxes
any
call
that's
billed
there.
