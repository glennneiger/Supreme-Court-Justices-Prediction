mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
all
right.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
a
state
tax
on
the
act
or
privilege
of
engaging
in
interstate
phone
calls,
a
form
of
interstate
commerce
that
by
its
very
nature
occurs
in
more
than
one
state
at
once,
simultaneously,
that
introduces
into
two
states
at
once
substantial
economic
activities
and
involves
the
delivery
of
services
in
two
states
at
once,
and
in
fact
can
become
the
subject
of
a
tax
in
at
least
two
states
at
once.
nevertheless,
in
this
case,
illinois
has
levied
a
tax
on
the
whole
of
all
interstate
phone
calls
that
originate
or
terminate
in
illinois
and
that
are
charged
to
an
illinois
service
address.
the
question
these
circumstances
raise,
we
believe,
is
whether
or
not
this
violates
the
interstate
commerce
clause.
and
in
our
view
it
does.
in
fact,
it
violates
all
three
of
the
elements
of
this
court's
complete
auto
decision.
and
what
i--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
because
the
state
courts
have
held
already
that
the
tax
is,
in
fact,
levied
on
the
entirety
of
the
call.
it
is
true
that
the
taxable
event
is
the
origination
or
the
receipt,
but
both
lower
courts
have
construed
the
statute
to
levy
the
tax
on
the
entirety
of
the
phone
call.
and
unlike
a
sales
tax,
which
this
court
has
often
reviewed,
where
it
can
be
isolated
in
a
single
taxing
jurisdiction,
in
this
particular
circumstance,
it...
the
interstate
phone
call
cannot
be
isolated
in
a
single
taxing
jurisdiction
because
economic
activity
by
definition
is
occurring
in
two
different
states
at
once.
moreover,
unlike
a
sales
tax
situation,
here
the
delivery
of
goods
occurs
partly
outside
the
state,
and
by
the
definition
of
its
own
statute
whether
or
not
the
call
is
billed
for
or
paid
for
in
illinois,
illinois
nevertheless
taxes
the
call.
and
the
result
is
we
risk
multiple
taxation.
in
our
view,
the
tax
violates
all
three
of
the
complete
auto
requirements
for
slightly
different
reasons.
but
at
bottom,
there's
one
reason
why
all
three
elements
are
violated,
and
that
is
because
this
tax
reaches
outside
illinois'
borders
to
tax
the
whole
of
the
call
as
both
lower
courts
found
when
they
rejected
the
proposition
that
what
was
being
taxed
was
only
in
state
in
commerce.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
well,
this--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--if
it
had
been
apportioned,
your
honor.
this
is
not--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--not
whereas
here,
your
honor,
part
of
the
commerce
by
definition
occurs
outside
the
taxing
state.
it
is
true
that
in
a
case
like
moorman,
the
court
upheld
a
gross
receipts
tax,
but
that's
because
an
apportionment
formula
was
used.
some
methodology
was
adopted
to
measure
that
part
of
the
commerce
that
had
occurred
within
the
taxing
state.
here
that
has
not
been
done.
illinois
has
elected
to
tax
the
entirety
of
the
call
even
though
by
definition,
a
portion
of
the
call
necessarily
occurs
outside
the
taxing
state.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
would
say
not
because--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
the
distinction
between
holmes
and
this
case
is
that
in
holmes
the
tax
had
been
apportioned,
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
its
opinion.
the
tax
was
limited
to
the
in-state
distribution
of
the
catalogs,
and
it
very
carefully
had
been
done
so.
in
addition,
in--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--and
the
use
tax,
your
honor,
was
levied
only
upon
the
in-state
distribution
of
the
catalogs.
no
catalogs
that
had
been
distributed
outside
of
the
state
were
subject
to
the
use
tax.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
illinois--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--that's
right,
your
honor.
under
the
language--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--your
honor,
the
construction
of
this
statute
is
that
the
tax
is
levied
only
upon
calls
that
are
charged
to
an
illinois
service
address--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--irrespective
of...
right...
irrespective
of
where
it's--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--of
where
it's
paid
for
or
where
it's
billed,
which
means
that
another
state
could
also
tax
the
same
interstate
phone
call.
for
example,
illinois
elects
to
tax
the
origination
of
a
call,
on
the
whole
of
the
call,
because
it
happens
to
be
charged
to
an
illinois
service
address.
but
another
state
may
choose
to
tax
the
termination
of
the
call
because
it's
billed
and
paid
for
in
that
state.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
the
washington
state
tax,
as
it
reads,
your
honor,
suggests
that
any
call
that
originates
or
terminates
in
washington
and
is
billed
and
paid
there
will,
in
fact,
be
taxed
by
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
we're
unaware
that
any
particular
taxpayer
in
illinois
has
had
that
tax
applied
to
him,
your
honor,
but
under
this
court's
armco
and
container
corporation
and
scheiner
decisions,
it
is
not
our
burden
to
prove
that
the
tax
is
actually
being
imposed
on
an
illinois
taxpayer
today
because,
as
the
court
pointed
out,
to
have
such
a
rule
would
require
the
court
to
be
monitoring
what
all
the
other
states
are
doing.
and
i
might
add
that
today
the
state's
taxing
of
interstate
telecommunications
is
in
a
state
of
flux
and
changing.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
no
doubt
about
that.
no
doubt.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
well
because,
your
honor,
it
violates
three
of
the
important
complete
auto
requirements.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
well,
that
isn't
altogether
clear,
your
honor,
how
the
credit
provision
would
work.
and
let
me
just
address
that
because
that's
one
of
the
major
arguments
that
the
state
is
making
here,
that
even
though
we
have
a
completely
unapportioned
tax,
that
the
credit
provision
that's
in
the
statute
will
be
effective
to
set
it
right
and
cure
it.
in
our
view
it
will
not.
indeed,
in
our
view
this
court
has
never
approved
a
credit
provision
on
the
ground
that
it
will
say
they
wholly
unapportioned
the
tax.
and
in
the
holmes
case
mentioned
by
your
honor,
that
was
not
the
case
because
the
tax
was
already
apportioned
when
the
credit
provision
was
looked
to.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
well,
in
our
view,
your
honor,
it
couldn't
accomplish
apportionment
for
two
reasons.
one
is
that
it
would
do
so
only
fortuitously.
to
tack
on
a
credit
provision
on
a
wholly
unapportioned
tax
and
hope
that
the
states
and
the
participants...
interstate
commerce
will
be
able
to
sort
it
out,
there's
no
guarantee
that
the
sorting
out
will
ever
occur.
and
certainly
it
will
not
under
this
credit
provision,
and
let
me
explain
why
that's
true.
in
our
view
there
are
approximately...
in
fact,
not
approximately...
there
are
only
three
circumstances
that
could
occur
under
this
credit
provision.
one
is
that
no
other
state
will
tax
the
call.
another
is
that
the
other
state
will
tax
the
other
end
of
the
call.
and
the
third
is
that
the
state
will,
at
the
other
end
of
the
call,
will
attempt
to
tax
the
illinois
taxpayer.
in
our
view,
though,
in
none
of
these
circumstances
will
fair
apportionment
be
brought
about,
and
let
me
explain
why
that's
true.
if
no
other
state
taxes
the
call,
fair
apportionment
will
not
be
brought
about.
illinois
will
still
have
taken
more
than
its
fair
share
of
the
commerce.
and
at
the
same
time,
it
will
have
subverted
and
preempted
the
choice
of
the
state
at
the
other
end
of
the
call
not
to
tax
the
interstate
commerce.
the
second
possibility
is
that
the
state
at
the
other
end
of
the
call
will
tax
its
own
taxpayer.
but
by
the
terms
of
this
statute,
its
credit
provision,
no
credit
will
be
permitted
in
that
circumstance
because
this
credit
provision
grants
a
credit
only
where
illinois'
own
taxpayer
is
taxed
twice.
so,
those
are
the
two...
two
of
the
circumstances,
and
in
neither
of
those
will
fair
apportionment
be
brought
about.
now,
the
third
circumstance
is
where
the
other
state
attempts
to
tax
the
illinois
taxpayer.
but
in
our
view,
even
in
that
circumstance,
fair
apportionment
will
still
not
be
brought
about,
and
there
are
two
reasons
for
that.
first
of
all,
the
credit
provision
by
its
own
terms
grants
a
credit
to
the
illinois
taxpayer
only
where
the
other
state
taxes
the
same
event
that
illinois
has
already
taxed.
but
by
the
terms
of
the
statute,
as
construed
by
the
lower
court,
the
event
that
is
taxed
is
the
origination
or
termination
of
the
call
that
is
charged
to
an
illinois
service
address.
so
that
if
the
other
state
taxes
termination
where
a
call
is
billed
or
paid,
while
illinois
has
taxed
origination
where
the
call
is
charged,
two
different
events
will
be
taxed
and
no
credit
will
be
permitted.
furthermore--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--that
may
be
true
for
the
sale-use
tax
situation,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
but
here
what
we
have
is
a...
what
you've
just
called
a
unitary
event.
we
have
an...
a
tax
being
laid
on
the
act
or
privilege
of
participating
in
an
interstate
phone
call.
there
is
simply
no
doubt
that
two
different
states
can
tax
that
event.
and
since
that
is
true,
this
court's
decisions
require
that
the
tax
be
apportioned
so
that
each
state
tax
that
part
of
the
event
that's
occurring
within
in
its
borders
because
otherwise,
if
each
state
says
we
will
tax
100
percent,
the
result
will
be...
and
i
think
this
is
the
basis
of
the
apportionment
requirement...
multiple
taxation
on
interstate
commerce.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
well,
you
could,
your
honor,
but
if
each
tax
said...
if
each
state
says
we
will
tax
the
placing
of
the
call
in
our
state,
and
then
taxes
the
entirety
of
the
call--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--as
the
measure
of
the
tax...
as
the
measure
of
the
tax,
it
is
inevitable
that
the
call
will
be
taxed
at
least
twice,
and
if
there's
a
third
state
participating,
could
be
taxed
all
over
again--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--that
is
right,
your
honor,
and
in
each
case
the
court
held
that
only
one
jurisdiction
could
levy
the
sales
or
the
use
tax.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
true.
true,
your
honor,
but
it's
measuring
the
tax
by
the
entirety
of
the
call,
including
the
portion
of
the
call
that
does
not
occur
within
the
taxing
state's
borders
which...
let
me
just
add...
which
is
not
the
case
in
a
sales-use
tax
situation.
this
court
has
always
held
that
sales
taxes
are
permitted
as
an
unapportioned
tax
only
where
only
one
jurisdiction
could
tax
the
sale.
and
in
holmes,
the
court
upheld
that
use
tax
because
only
one
jurisdiction
could
have
taxed
the
unapportioned...
the
apportioned
amount
of
the
use
occurring
within
louisiana.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
sure.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
that
would
come,
in
our
view,
a
lot
closer
to
a
constitutional--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--but
it
would
be
apportioned.
the
result,
your
honor,
would
not
be
that,
in
fact,
illinois
was
taxing
commerce
outside
its
borders.
the
apportionment
would
have
been
a
way
to
measure
that
part
of
the
commerce
you've
just
described
that's
occurring
only
within
illinois'
borders.
illinois
would
still
not
be
taxing
outside
its
borders--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--two
and
a
half
percent
on
all
interstate
phone
calls
and
5
percent
on
intrastate
phone
calls...
if,
your
honor,
the
apportionment
formulas
of
the
kind
we
have
suggested
may
be
permissible
in
our
brief--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--because
that
isn't
what
the
state
chose
to
do.
illinois...
the
illinois
legislature
did
not
decide
to
tax
all
calls
within
its
borders,
as
your
hypothetical
just
put
it.
it
decided
only
to
tax
100
percent
of
certain
calls,
those
calls
that
were
charged
to
an
illinois
service
address.
the
legislature
never
decided
to
use
the
apportionment
formula
you
just
described.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
because,
as
i
think
the
scheiner
decision
illustrates,
your
honor,
that
would
require
the
netting
of
taxpayers.
the
fact
that
the
state
might
receive
the
right
amount
of
revenue
when
all
was
totaled
up,
would
not
mean
that
individual
participants
in
interstate
commerce
had
been
fairly
treated.
you
would
have
to
net
transactions.
indeed,
you
have
to
net
taxpayers
in
order
for
that
to
be
the
right
result.
and
we
submit
under
the
scheiner
decision,
that
isn't
permissible.
let
me
talk
about
the
fair
relation
requirement
because
you've
let
me
touch
on
some
of
the
other
elements
that...
that
i
wanted
to
talk
about.
and
i...
the
reason
i
was
going
to
start
with
fair
relation
is
because
i
think
it
is
simpler
than
the
other
matters
we've
been
talking
about.
the
fair
relation
requirement
requires
a
state
to
measure
its
tax
according
to
the
contact
of
the
commerce
with
the
taxing
state.
but,
in
fact,
illinois
has
not
done
that.
indeed,
as
we've
tried
to
point
it
out
in
our
brief,
illinois
has,
in
fact,
done
the
reverse
of
that.
it
has
levied
a
tax
that
is
inversely
proportional
to
the
contact
with
the
taxing
state.
and
that's
easy
enough
to
see.
you
take
a
single
interstate
phone
call,
and
the
longer
is
the
call,
the
further
away
from
illinois
it
gets
and,
therefore,
the
higher
is
the
price
of
the
call
and,
therefore,
the
higher
is
the
tax.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
you're
right.
it
is
not
always
true,
your
honor,
but
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--you're
right,
your
honor.
it
is
not
always
true,
but
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases,
it
is
true
as
the
data
before
this
court
show
and
as
mr.
wiley's
affidavit
before
this
court
shows.
and
this
court
has
held
in
maryland
v.
louisiana
that
we
don't
have
to
decide
how
unconstitutional
a
tax
is.
the
fact
that
it
may
be
unconstitutional
in
a
majority
of
the
instances
before
the
court
is
enough
to
strike...
to
strike
the
tax
down.
illinois
had
an
obligation
to
draft
a
tax
that
would
be
constitutional
in
all
circumstances,
and
it
has
not
so.
it
has
not
attempted
to
apportion
this
tax.
it
has
not
attempted
to
measure
it
in
a
way
that
limits
it
to
the
contact
within
illinois.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
your
honor,
our
argument
does
not
depend
on
that
being
so,
and
the
state
has
misconstrued
our
position.
it
is
not
our
view
that
the
state
is
required
on
a
call-by-call
basis
to
measure
how
much
of
each
call
occurs
in
each
intervening
state.
indeed,
if
you
believe
the
state's
position,
none
of
the
intervening
states,
in
fact,
have
nexus
to
tax
the
call.
but
it's
enough
to
sustain
our
argument
that
unquestionably
in
every
interstate
call,
at
least
two
states
have
nexus
and
have
the
constitutional
right
to
tax
the
call.
and
if
illinois
can
tax
the
whole
of
the
call,
as
both
lower
courts
have
held
that
it
has
done,
so
can
the
state
at
the
other
end
of
the
line,
and
the
inevitable
result,
we
submit
to
the
court,
is
multiple
taxation.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
that's
right,
your
honor.
the
statute
expressly
exempts
those
calls.
so,
our
view
is
that
illinois
could
choose
not
to
tax
certain
interstate
commerce.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
and
that
is
what
it
did.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
if
that
had
been
what
this
legislature
wanted
to
do,
your
honor--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--well,
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
it
did
not.
indeed,
if
you
read
the
state's
own
brief,
you'll
find
that
it
did
not.
the
illinois
legislature
made
a
judgment
not
to
tax
certain
calls
in
part
because
it
thought
it
didn't
have
nexus
to
do
so.
and
we
would
submit
this
court
should
not
now
rewrite
the
statute
and
say
what
the
illinois
legislature
really
wanted
to
do
was
tax
every
call
and
apportion
it
by
saying
if
we
tax
100
percent
of
these
calls
and
none
of
these
calls
over
here,
it
will
all
come
in
the
wash.
a,
that
is
not
what
the
illinois
legislature
did;
and
b,
even
if
it
had,
your
honor,
it
is
still--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--i
would
say
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
section
4
of
this
act,
the
illinois
legislature
determined
to
tax
only
one
set
of
interstate
commerce,
calls
that
were
charged
to
an
illinois
service
address,
and
by
the
statute
it
decided
to
exempt
from
taxation
altogether
the
other
kinds
of
calls
you're
describing.
i'm
saying
that
was
a
judgment
the
illinois
legislature
was
entitled
to
make.
if
it
had
wanted
to
do
what
you
have
just
said,
it
would
have
passed
a
statute
saying
we
tax
all
calls
that
originate
and
terminate
in
illinois
irrespective
of
whether
they
are
charged
to
an
illinois
service
address,
and
we
will
apportion
the
tax
by
levying
100
percent
on
some
calls
and
zero
on
others.
but
that
is
not
the
statute
the
illinois
legislature
passed,
your
honor.
and
further,
even
if
it
had,
i
would
submit
to
you
that
the
fact
that
the
right
amount
of
revenues
that
are
received
by
the
state
of
illinois
doesn't
begin
to
offer
any
assurance
that
individual
taxpayers
will
be
fairly
treated.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
exactly,
your
honor.
and
there's
no
evidence
whatever--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--[inaudible]
support
that
proposition.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
and
we
agree
a
rough
approximation
would
be
sufficient,
your
honor,
but
we
would
submit
that
using
a
service
address
as
a
proxy
for
measuring
what
part
of
economic
activity
occurred
in
the
state
is
arbitrary.
it
is
not
a
rough
approximation.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
well,
i
guess
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
what
you
have
required
is
fair
apportionment.
and
it's
true,
as
the
chief
justice
points
out,
that
fair
apportionment
can
be
a
rough
approximation.
but
at
the
very
least
in
drawing
a
fair
apportionment
formula,
albeit
a
rough
approximation,
the
court
has
always
required
that
whatever
formula
is
used,
both
on
its
face
and
in
practice,
can
be
expected
to
measure
the
part
of
interstate
commerce
that
occurs
within
the
taxing
state's
borders.
and
this
apportionment
formula...
and
i
still
beg
to
differ,
justice
stevens...
a
formula
not
adopted
by
the
state
of
illinois,
but
even
if
it
had,
there
is
nothing
to
suggest
that
it
will
in
practice
effect
an
apportionment
both
for
the
reason
justice
stevens
says
that
you
can't...
i
think
you
cannot
assume
without
some
data
base
to
suppose
it...
that
each
caller
within
illinois
is
going
to
have
half
of
his
calls
charged
to
his
serve
address...
service
address
and
the
other
half
not.
furthermore,
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
the
service
address
to
begin
with
is
going
to
be
some
fair
method
for
measuring
the
economic
activity
within
the
state.
i
think
i'll
save
the
rest
for
rebuttal.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
our...
our
primary
answer
to
i
think
most
of
what
counsel
has
been
saying
is
that
he's
trying
to
litigate
a
statute
other
than
the
one
that's
before
this
court.
the
statute
that
is
before
this
court
has
levied
a
tax
on
the
act
or
privilege
of
engaging
in
an
interstate
phone
call,
either
the
origination
or
the
termination
of
the
phone
call.
that
is
the
tax,
and
it
has
been
measured
by
taxing
the
illinois
taxpayer
on
the
whole
of
the
gross
charge
for
the
call.
we
would
submit
there
is
no
question
but
what
the
other
participating
state
in
such
an
interstate
phone
call
has
nexus
and
constitutional
authority
also
to
tax
the
call.
and
if
illinois
can
tax
the
whole
of
the
call,
so
too
can
the
state
at
the
other
end
of
the
line.
the
only
explanation,
as
we
understand
counsel,
that
he
gives
for
justifying
this
risk
of
multiple
taxation
is
that
there
is
this
apportionment
formula
that
i
say
to
you
he
has
created
and
the
state
has
not
written.
and
even
if
the
legislature
had
written
it,
there's
absolutely
no
evidence
to
show
that
the
netting
effect
that
he
talks
about
is
going
to
produce
the
correct
amount
of
revenues
either
as
a
whole
and
certainly
not
in
the
case
of
individual
taxpayers,
including
the
two
plaintiffs
before
this
court.
the
other
rewriting
of
the
statute
that
counsel
wants
to
do
is
to
call
this
a
sales-tax
because
he
likes
the
tests
for
a
sales
tax
much
better
than
he
likes
the
tests
for
the
particular
tax
before
the
court.
but
this
court
has
made
clear
in
case
after
case
that
an
unapportioned
sales
tax
is
illegitimate
only
when
the
particular
event
being
taxed
cannot
be
taxed
by
any
other
jurisdiction.
and
it
is
for
that
reason
an
unapportioned
tax
is
permitted.
but
not
only
is
this
not
a
sales
tax
as
written
and
as
construed
by
the
lower
courts,
but
in
substance
it
is
not
a
sales
tax.
the
delivery
of
all
of
the
goods
here
being
taxed
were
not
delivered
in
the
state
of
illinois.
part
of
the
economic
activity
by
definition...
and
this
underlies
our
whole
argument...
occurred
outside
the
state
of
illinois.
and
illinois
did
not
attempt
to
tax
the
purchase
here.
it
taxed
only
calls
that
were
charged
to
illinois
irrespective
of
where
the
particular
call
was
billed
or
paid
for.
so,
neither
in
form
nor
in
substance
is
this
a
sales
tax.
and
the
final
rewriting
of
the
statute
he's
interested
in
is
to
call
this
a
gross
receipts
tax.
and
he
has
told
this
court
that
you
have
approved
unapportioned
gross
receipts
tax
on
interstate
commerce.
it
is
not
so.
this
court
has
always
required
apportionment
of
any
tax
that
is
laid
on
the
entire
volume
of
interstate
commerce
that
occurs
in
a
particular
taxing
jurisdiction.
that
is
what
illinois
has
done
here.
there
is
no
apportionment
formula
being
used
here
like
moorman
or
any
other
formula
that
this
court
has
approved.
and
we
urge
this
court
not
to
rewrite
the
statute
for
the
legislature,
create
an
apportionment
formula
the
legislature
did
not
choose
to
use,
make
assumptions
that
every
taxpayer
in
illinois
has
50
percent
of
his
calls
charged
to
his
service
address
and
50
percent
outside.
this
court
held
in
the
mccloud
case
and
in
the
henneford
case
both
you
judge
the
statutes
as
they
come
before
you.
you
adjudicate
the
constitutionality
of
the
tax
that
the
legislature
wrote.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
moorman.
and
the
formula
used
in
moorman
was...
as
the
court
knows,
it
was
a
sales
formula.
the
sales
in
state
was
the
numerator
and
the
sales
out
of
state
was
the
denominator,
and
that's
multiplied
by
the
gross
receipts.
whenever
this
court
has
reviewed
a
gross
receipts
tax
on
interstate
commerce,
only
part
of
which
occurred
in
a
particular
state,
apportionment
is
required
because
in
the
absence
of
apportionment,
the
state
not
only
taxes
commerce
outside
its
borders,
which
it
cannot
do,
but
it
also
subjects
that...
the
particular
event
in
question
to
multiple
taxation.
