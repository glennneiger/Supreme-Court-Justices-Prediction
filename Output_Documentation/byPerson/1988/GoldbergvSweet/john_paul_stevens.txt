mr.
smith,
may...
may
i
interrupt
you
and
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
illinois
charges
5
percent
on
calls
within
the
state
of
illinois,
and
then
it
charged
2
and
a
half
percent
on
all
calls
going
across
the
state
line.
the
2
and
a
half
percent
would
apply
to
every
call
received
whether
or
not
billed
within
the
state
and
every
call
originating
within
the
state.
would
that
be
constitutional
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
many
of
your
arguments
would
apply
to
that
situation
too
because
the
2
and
half
percent
would
be
on
the
entire
transaction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
be
sure
i...
is
your
view
that
that
tax
would
be
permissible
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
the
reason
i
ask
is
that
your
opponent
argues
this
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
that
tax
because
although
it's
100
percent
taxed,
they
really
only
tax
half
the
calls
because
they
tax
those
that
are
billed
in
illinois
and
those
that
are
not
billed
in
illinois
are
just
not
taxed
at
all.
so,
what's
the
difference
between
50
percent
of
100
percent
of
the
calls
and
100
percent
of
50
percent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
if
they
could
demonstrate...
i
don't
know
whether
they
could
or
not...
that
this
resulted
in
a
functional
equivalent
because
the
same
number
of
tax
dollars
would
be
collected,
what's
wrong
with
it
in
terms
of
burdening
interstate
commerce?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
taxing
the
whole
of
the
call
by
taxing
the
whole
of
half
of
the
calls...
roughly
half.
you
have
to
mix
up
your
callers,
but
isn't
that
true,
because
it
doesn't
impose
any
tax
on
those
calls
that
originate
in
illinois
and
are
collect
to
somebody
in
seattle?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
look
at
it
call
by
call,
it
taxes
the
whole
of
the
call.
if
you
look
at
the
universe
of
calls,
it
roughly
taxes
half
of
the
calls.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
what
it
did.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
understand
why
you
say
it's
not
what
they
did.
it
seems
to
me
that's
exactly
what
the
statute
does.
i
mean,
there's
probably
a
problem
with
respect
to
calls
from
chicago
to
seattle
that
are
billed
to
somebody
in
atlanta.
i
understand
there's
a
problem
there,
but
leaving
that
to
one
side,
isn't
that
exactly
what
it
did?
it
taxed
just
those
calls
that
are
paid
for...
or
charged
to
the
number
in
illinois,
and
that's...
we
can
i
think
make
a
reasonable
assumption
that
is
roughly
half
the
calls.
and
you
say
they
didn't
do
that.
now,
explain
to
me
why
they
didn't
do
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
unless
you
make
the
further
assumption
that
the
average
individual
phone
user
originates
about
the
same
number
of
calls
he
receives.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it's
not
a...
it's
not
a
ridiculous
assumption.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
frey,
what
about
a
call
from
chicago
to
seattle
that
someone
in
florida
puts
on
his
florida
credit
card...
on
his
florida--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--charges
to
the
florida
number,
but
it's--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it's
definitely
not
taxed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
an
illinois
subscriber
makes
a
call
from
florida
to
seattle,
charges
it
to
his
illinois
number.
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
leave
that,
mr.
frey,
they...
they...
as
i
understand
your
opponent,
he
said,
well,
but
in
order
to
take
that
position,
you
have
to
mix
up
your
taxpayers
and
lump
them
all
together
in
a
way
that
scheiner
prohibits.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
would
think
it
would
be.
