87-826,
goldberg
v.
sweet.
mr.
smith,
we'll
wait
just
a
moment--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--until
some
of
the
people
clear
out
or
stop
talking.
0....
very
well.
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready,
mr.
smith.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
any
state,
in
fact,
done
that
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
that...
has
that
been
applied
to
some
taxpayer
in
illinois?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
the
states
are
going
to
be
entitled
to
tax
this
sort
of
activity
in
some
way.
i
mean,
there
isn't
any
doubt
about
that,
is
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
so,
why
isn't
the
illinois
way
a
relatively
reasonable
way
to
approach
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
shouldn't
we
approve
it
now
if
it
accomplishes
the
same
result
as
apportionment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
smith,
are
you
suggesting
that
any
state
other
than,
say,
illinois
and
washington
could
tax
a
call
that
originates
in
illinois,
in
chicago,
to
somebody
in
seattle?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
our
tax
cases,
we've
talked
about
a
rough
approximation
being
sufficient.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
smith.
mr.
frey,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
frey.
mr.
smith,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
smith.
the
case
is
submitted.
