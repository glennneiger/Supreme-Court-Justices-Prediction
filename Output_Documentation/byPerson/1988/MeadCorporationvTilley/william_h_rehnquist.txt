we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
87-1868,
mead
corporation
against
tilley.
mr.
mccartan,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--where
can
we
find
this
in
the
briefs?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mccartan.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
harrison,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
what
section
of
the
statute
is
that,
mr.
harrison?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
will
we
find
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
doesn't
immediately
strike
me
as
proving
exactly--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
on
the
early
retirement
benefit
under
the
plan--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--doesn't
that
mean
it
would
have
to
comply
with
all
the
terms
of
the
plan?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
a
case
from
the
fourth
circuit,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
exactly
did
your
client...
your
clients
had
all
worked
there,
what?
nearly
30
was
it--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
they
had...
none
of
them
had
reached...
reached
age
62?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
so
what...
what
did
they
in
fact
get
from
mead
voluntarily
when
the
plan
was
terminated?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
accrued
pension
benefit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
so
how
much
was
that
roughly?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
order
of
magnitude?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
the
"benefit
paid"
column
you're
reading
from?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
amount
you
say
they
should
have
paid
is
in
the
next
column
over?
so
that
tilley
got
$87,000,
but
he
should
have
gotten
$100,000
in
your
view?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
the...
but
the
two--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
two
columns
are
correct,
in
at
least
the
order
of
magnitude.
when
i
say
that,
it
might
be
87,
it
might
be
88,
it
might
be
100,
it
might
be
101.
but
you're
not
talking
about
200
as
opposed
to
100?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
increment
of
what
you
claim
over
what
you
got
is
a
minor
percentage
of
what
you
got.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
harrison.
the
case
is
submitted.
