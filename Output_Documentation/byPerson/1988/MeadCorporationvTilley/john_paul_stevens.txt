justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
you
a
question--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
bothers
me
a
little
bit.
there
is
a
provision,
as
i
recall,
in
the
statute
that
says
before
you
get
any
reversion
of
the
$10
million
you've
got
to
satisfy
all
liabilities,
including
contingent
liabilities.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
could
it
not
be
argued
that
whether
or
not
it's
technically
accrued
or
not
you
do
have
a
contingent
liability
for
this
early
retirement
payment
which
you
must
fund?
the
statute
requires
you
to
be
actuarially
sound
and
all
the
rest
of
it.
so
why
is
that
not
a
contingent
liability?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
it.
can
i
find
anything
in
either...
if
i
just
looked
at
the
statute
and
the
terms
of
your
plan,
how
would
i
know
whether
or
not
the
potential
liability
to
a
retiree
age
62
and
over,
and
over
30
years
of
service,
whether
or
not
that's
a
contingent
liability?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
ask
you
another...
put
the
question
a
little
differently.
supposing
a
man
had
30
years
of
service
and
was
63
years
old
and
there
was
a
termination,
would
he
not
have
a
right
to
the
early
retirement
benefit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
why...
at
the
time
you've
terminated
this
plan
some
of
these
people
were
in
that
very
posture.
why
wasn't
there
a
contingent
liability
to
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
you're
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
when
that
individual
was
61
and
had
20
years
of
service,
there
was
no
contingent
liability
for
this
premium?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
said
there
is
no
contingent
liability.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
it
hadn't
vested.
i
can
see
your
article
viii
talks
about
vesting,
but
i'm
not
sure--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
order
to
be
actuarially
sound
you
must
have
put
away...
you
must
have
planned
for
that
possibility
of
paying
that
person.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
that
because
they
are
contingent
liabilities?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
may
never
be
earned,
but
in
the
period
before
they're
earned
are
they
not
contingent
liabilities?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they're
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
difference
between
liability
and
a
contingent
liability
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand.
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let's
leave
out
the
words
"accrued
benefit".
at
the
date
of...
when
this
plan
was
terminated
your
position
is
there
was
no
contingent
liability
to
these
particular
claimants?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
the
day
before
the
plan
terminated?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
they
are
the
only
contingent
liabilities?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they're
not
only
contingent,
those
are
actual
liabilities.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no.
i'm
talking
about
people
who
have
served
mere
than
10
years.
and
all
of
them
have
vested
rights,
don't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
just...
let
me
back
up
right
there
for
a
minute.
say
you've
got
an
employee
in
this
particular
plan
who
works
six
years.
he
had
something
that
accrued.
did
he
get
any
money
out
of
this
distribution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
did?
they
agree
with
that?
because
i...
frankly,
when
i
read
page
20
of
the
pbg
brief,
i
don't...
it
doesn't
come
across
to
me--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--clear
as
a
bell
that
that
happened.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
undisputed,
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
wouldn't
that
mean
that
for
every
employee
covered
by
the
plan
who
was...
hadn't
reached
62...
or
is
55,
that
the
calculation
of
the
retirement
benefit
would
be
based
on
the
early
retirement
for
him
rather
than
the
ordinary
retirement
date
because
it
would
always
be
larger,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
this...
so
that
although
your
suit
only
involves
five
or
six
people
who
were,
you
know,
very
close
to
the
cliff,
or
the
second
cliff,
actually,
the
principle
at
stake
affects
everybody
in
the
plan.
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
would...
but
it
would
seem
to
me
that
everybody
in
the
plan
would,
would
profit
by
getting
the...
by
having
the
pension
calculated
on
the
basis
of
early
retirement
rather
than
ordinary
retirement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
there
aren't
funds
aside
employee
by
employee,
as
you've
explained
in
your
colloquy
with
justice
scalia.
you
actually
set
aside
a
large
amount
of
money
based
on
the
actuary's
computation
of
how
many
are
apt
to
stay
in
the...
in
the
company--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--for
so
long.
and
so
you
don't
have
sums
of
money
allocated
to
each
employee.
you
have
just
a
lump
of
funds.
so,
how
can
you...
how
can
you--
--so
i
don't
know
how
much--
--pay
these
few
people?
you'd
probably
run
out
of
money.
