mr.
mccartan,--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--i
guess
we
have
here
two
different
categories
of
employees.
those
who
had
worked
the
30
years
but
weren't
yet
62,
and
those
employees
who
were
neither.
they
hadn't
yet
worked
the
30
years
and
they
weren't
62.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
is
there
possibly
a
distinction
there?
has
somebody
who
has
worked
the
30
years
in
effect
earned
the
retirement
benefits?
could
you
say
they
are
accrued
but
not
yet
vested
until
they
are
62?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
guess
you've
read
that
ashenbaugh
decision
out
of
what...
the
third
circuit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
judge
mansmann's
opinion
in
that
that
tried
to
draw
that
distinction.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
uh-huh.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
although
normal
retirement
benefits
accrue
continuously
during--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
for
tax
treatment
of
these
pension
plans,
i
gather
that
you
calculate
the
contingent
liability
created
by
the
early
retirement
provisions
and
irs
would
take
account
of
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
what
about
mead's
early
retirement
benefits
under
that--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--irs
definition?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
thirty-two
and
33
of
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
harrison,
the
pension
benefit
guaranty
corporation
supports
your
opponent
in
this
case.
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that's
the
agency
that
presumably
is
mere
familiar
with
this
statute
than
other
agencies
might
be?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
don't
we
normally
defer
to
agency
interpretation
of
these
complicated
matters?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
haven't
there
been
any
number
of
plans
that
have
terminated
with
the
consent
and
approval
of
irs
and
the
pension
benefit
guaranty
corporation,
where
your
position
just
wasn't
followed?
they
let
the
surplus
be
paid
back
to
the
employer.
