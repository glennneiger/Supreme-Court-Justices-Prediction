mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
critical
issue
for
this
court
is
the
determination
of
section
1334
of
erisa.
and
the
one
thing
that.
i
would
like
to
get
clear
before
this
court
is
that
mead
spends
most
of
its
argument
on
an
issue
that
we
have
already
conceded.
we
have
conceded
that
this
was
not
intended
by
congress
to
be
an
accrued
benefit.
and
there
is
a
perfectly
good
reason
why
it
could
not
have
been
an
accrued
benefit,
and
that
reason
is
to
make
this
an
accrued
benefit
would
have
destroyed
this
benefit.
in
1983
and
in
1974
when
erisa
was
passed,
the
concept
of
an
accrued
benefit
was
tied
to
the
concept
of
vesting...
vesting...
all
accrued
benefit;
had
to
vest
within
the
vesting
rules.
the
vesting
rules
had
a
maximum
of
a
10-year
vesting
schedule,
10-year
cliff
vesting.
that
was
the
longest
you
could
take.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
vesting.
ten-year
cliff
vesting.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
okay.
a
cliff
vesting
is
that
you
don't
vest
any
benefits
until
you
actually
reach
the
10
years.
then
you
just
fall
off
the
cliff
and
you're
vested.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
two
fs.
[laughter]
it's
what
is
called
10-year
cliff
vesting.
instead
of
a
gradual
slope
vesting,
it's
a
cliff.
you
just
fall
right
off
it
and
you
vest.
and
that's
the
problem.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
and
that
was
the
problem
with
making
this
benefit
a...
a
subject
to
the
accruals.
if
you
subject...
if
you
subjected
the
accruals
to
this
benefit,
you
would
eliminate
this
benefit,
because
this
benefit
had
30
years'
cliff
vesting.
an
early
retirement
benefit
is
a
benefit
who
vest
longer
than
what
the
accrual
rules
will
permit.
so,
congress
did
not
subject
the
early
retirement
benefits
to
the
accrual,
and
allowed
the
employers
and
employees
to
fashion
this
type
of
benefit.
the
accrual
rules
were
merely
the
minimum
rules
on
the
basic
type
benefits
payable
to
age
65,
which
congress
was
going
to
require
employees
to
be
subject
to
the
vesting
rules.
the
early
retirement
benefits
are
specifically
included.
that
doesn't
mean
that
congress
intended
to
leave
out
early
retirement
benefits.
no,
no,
no.
congress
specifically,
in
the
definition
of
normal
retirement
benefits,
includes
early
retirement
benefits,
in
that
definition.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
one-zero-zero-two,
subparagraph
22.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
we
find
that
on,
i
believe,
page
10
of
the
red
brief.
i
correct...
it's
on
page
8.
i'm
reading
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
page.
it
extends
over
to
page
9.
"for
the
purposes
of
this
paragraph.
"
is
what
it
begins
with.
and
we
skip
down
a
few
sentences,
i'm
reading
now
at
the
top
of
page
9.
"the
early
retirement
benefit
under
a
plan
shall
be
determined
without
regard
to
any
benefit
of
the
plan
which
the
treasury.
"
fine.
and
they
also
talk
about--
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
--well,
pardon
me,
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
really
what
i
needed
to
cite
is
at
the
top
of...
at
the
top
of
page
8
there.
well,
that's
at
the
bottom
of
page
8.
"the
term
"normal
retirement
benefit"
means
the
greater
of
the
early
retirement
benefit
under
the
plan
or
the
benefit
under
the
plan
commencing
at
normal
retirement
age.
"
it's
the
greater
of
the
early
retirement
benefit
or
the
normal
retirement
benefit
at
normal
retirement
age.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
no,
your
honor.
the
quintessential
case
on
that
is
the
sutton
cases.
and
this
is
also
reflected
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
that's
correct,
your
honor.
certainly
not
binding
on
this
court.
the
benefit
under
the
plan
language
refers
to
a
benefit
that's
provided
under
the
plan,
as
opposed
to
a
benefit
which
is
provided
outside
of
the
plan.
on
page
10,
middle
paragraph,
you
have
a
section
which
talks
about
ancillary
benefit,
such
as
medical
or
life
insurance
benefits,
which
are
sometimes
provided
for
in
connection
with
a
pension
plan
and
are
sometimes
provided
separately.
there
are
benefits
that
can
be
provided
for
under
the
plan,
and
there
are
benefits...
there
are
employee
benefits,
such
as
salary,
which
are
provided
for
outside
of
an
employee
benefit
plan.
obviously,
you
would
not
pay
benefits
which
were
not
provided
under
the
plan
out
of
the
trust
fund
of
the
plan.
and
that
was
the
sutton
case.
we
had
an
early
retirement
benefit
which
was
funded
out
of
the
corporate
treasury
and
not
out
of
a
benefit
plan.
the
employees
in
sutton
sought
to
take
the
money
out
of
the
trust
fund,
feeling
that
was
a
stronger
case.
and
the
sutton
court
held
no,
that
a
benefit
under
the
plan
has
got
to
be
a
benefit
that
is
provided
for
in
the
plan.
and
in
the
sutton
case,
the
court
specifically
held
that
since
the
benefits
were
not
funded
under
the
plan,
then
the
benefits
were
not
provided
in
the
plan
and
there
was
no
recovery.
they
did
hold
that
the
employees
could
maintain
an
action,
if
they
felt
they
had
one,
against
the
employer's
corporate
treasury.
now,
what
these
employees
are
asking
for,
what
they're
asking
this
court
for,
is
the
funds
that
are
set
aside
for
these
early
retirement
benefits.
mead
promised
these
employees
an
early
retirement
benefit
in
the
hopes
that
they
would
work
at
least
30
years.
and
they
old.
every
year
the
employees
performed
their
part
of
the
bargain,
year
by
year,
by
remaining
in
mead's
employment.
and
every
year
mead
funded
that
benefit,
little
by
little,
to
pay
for
it,
as
it
was
required
under
erisa.
this
went
on
for
years
and
years
until
a
large
sum
of
money
developed
in
the
trust
fund
specifically
allocated
to
pay
that
benefit.
now,
the
question
for
the
court
today
is--
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
--yes.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
the
funding
requirements
of
erisa
requires
the
funding
of
early
retirement
benefits.
while
they
may
not
vest,
they
are
required
to
be
funded.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
the...
no,
it
doesn't
say
that
specifically.
it
talks
about
the
plan
experience,
which
has
been
determined
in
the
regulations--
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
--to
include
funding
of
early
retirement
benefits.
and,
of
course,
that
was
done
in
this
case.
you've
got
to
fund
the
plan's
liabilities.
you
cannot,
based
on
what
the...
what--
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
--clearly
the
latter,
justice--
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
--clearly
the
latter.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
oh,
absolutely.
what
we
are
asking
this
court
for
is
not
payment
of
the
benefit.
we're
asking
for
the
money
that
was
set
aside
to
pay
these
benefits.
the
present
value
of
that
benefit,
if
you
would,
because
that
is
what
the
allocation
section
holds.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
that's
correct,
your
honor.
there
are
reasons
why
you
should
not
in
this
case,
first
of
which
is
that
the
internal
revenue
service
also
looks
at
these
matters.
and
in
an
identical
case,
the
amato
case
which
was
before
this
court
but
never
argued
because
it
was
dismissed
by
stipulation,
the
internal
revenue
service
on
this
very
issue
filed
an
amicus
in
support
of
the
employee's
position.
certainly
more
important--
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
--mead
suggested
that
it
isn't.
mead
suggested
that
it
isn't.
but
i
would
proffer
to
this
court
that
what
mead
has
cited
for
authority
in
that
proposition
in
no
way
holds
that.
there
is
no
published
authority
whatsoever...
to
my
knowledge,
no
private
authority
whatsoever
for
that
basis.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
only
by
the
pbgc.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
the
pbgc?
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
i
do
not
remember
the
attorney's
name,
your
honor.
but
i
do
have
it
in
front
of
me.
it
was
gary
m.
ford
general
counsel.
now--
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
--no.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
sure.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
yes.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
that's
correct.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
that's
correct,
and
they
get
that
amount
of
money
on
termination.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
oh,
yes.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
yes.
absolutely.
it's
under
priority
category
5.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
let
me
explain
the
pbgc's
position
here.
the
pbgc
agreed
with
me
that
in
erisa
on
two
basic
fallacies...
that
accrued
categories
occur
in
category
6.
now,
first
of
all,
congress
at
one
point
considered
that
very
issue.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
and
an
earlier
draft
of
the
house
bill
had
the
word
"accrued"
in
the
final
catchall
category.
they
took
it
out.
in
the
final
draft
of
erisa
they
took
the
word
"accrued"
out.
for
this
court
to
rule
with
the
pbgc,
they're
going
to
have
to
take
a
pen
and
pen
it
right
back
in.
secondly,
when
it
refers
to
all
other
non...
it
is
a
physical
impossibility
for
all
other
accrued
benefits
to
occur
in
category
6.
the
pbgc
on
page
20
of
its
brief
admits
that
the
benefits
that
justice
scalia
was
referring
to...
and
that
is
accrued
benefits
which
are
nonforfeitable
solely
because
of
termination.
and
i
may
be
overstepping
myself
one
step.
these
are
nonforfeitable...
all
accrued
benefits
vest
on
termination.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
that's
correct.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
however,
at
termination,
if
you
have
an
accrued
benefit
of
even
one
year...
even
one
year...
that
becomes
a
vested
benefit
solely
because
of
termination.
now,
if
you
were
to
leave
service
or
anything
else
happened
other
than
termination
before
the
ten
years,
your
benefit
is
gone.
it's
considered
forfeitable.
subject
to
determination.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
but
in
termination...
and
that's
on
page
20
of
the
pbgc
brief...
that
becomes
vested.
it's
vested
solely
because
of
termination.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
no.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
they'd
worked
all
over
30
years
except
one,
who
was
28
years.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
none
had
reached
age
62.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
they
got
the
actuarially
reduced
value
of
their
accrued
benefit.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
accrued
pension
benefits.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
and
none
of
the
contingent
liabilities.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
the
exact
numbers
are--
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
--the
exact
numbers
are
on
the
last
page
of
the
red
brief.
there
is
a
fold-back
section
labeled
appendix
1.
and
the
exact
benefits
to
bernard
tilley
was
$87,000;
to
w.
l.
crotts,
$87,000.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
that's
correct.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
well,
had
he
been...
had
they
based
the
early
retirement
benefit
on
age
62.
now,
of
course,
damages
was
a
question.
and
that...
that
particular
theory
of
damages
does
not
go
to
justice
scalia's
point
of
that...
you
wouldn't
fully
pay
this...
there
wouldn't
be
money
set
aside
to
fully
pay
this
benefit.
actually,
under
our
argument
that...
we
are
looking
for
the
funds
that
are
allocated
for
this
benefit.
there
wouldn't
be
funds
completely
sufficient
to
pay
this
benefit.
but
there
would
be
funds
in
the
pension
plan.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
because
this
case
was
decided
on
a
summary
judgment,
we
never
did
get
to
the
issue
of
exactly
how
much
funds--
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
--was
actually
there.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
oh,
no.
it's
a
relatively
small
benefit.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
that's
correct.
it
is
a
minor
percentage
of
what
we
actually
received.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
that
is
the
subsidized
early
retirement
benefit.
the
key
funding
provision...
this
is
a
matter
of
funding.
where
mead
and
where
the
employees
look
at
the
case
differently
is
that
mead
feels
that
the
benefit
must
be
payable.
the
employees
feel
that
the
benefit
merely
need
to
be
funded.
and
if
one
looks
at
section
1344(a),
which
is
or
page
9
of
the
employee's
brief...
okay...
wait
a
minute.
i'm
looking
for
1344(a),
and
that
was
not
it;
1344(a)
is
an
allocation
section.
now,
what
we
are
asking
for
is
the
trustee
to
allocate
benefits
to
us.
that
is
on
page
7
of
employee's
brief,
the
red
brief.
or,
a
better
place
to
look
to
see
how
the
assets
should
be
allocated,
then
look
at
the
statute.
and
the
statute
says
the
trustees
shall
allocate
the
assets
in
the
following
order,
and
it
sets
forth
six
priority
categories.
the
sixth
category
is
all
other
benefits
under
the
plan.
the
fifth
category,
curiously
enough,
is
all
other
nonforfeitable
benefits.
the
pbgc
rests
its
case
on
the
idea
that
only
nonforfeitable
benefits
occur
in
category
6.
now,
that
may
seem
completely
ridiculous
because
5
says
all
other
nonforfeitable
benefits.
but
that
is
where
they
rest
their
case.
the
pbgc's
argument
is
that
even
though
the
benefits
are
nonforfeitable
by
reason
of
termination,
they're
forfeitable
so
long
as
the
plan
is
continuing,
so
we
will
treat
them
as
forfeitable.
for
this
court
to
rule
with
the
pbgc
it's
going
to
have
to
use
both
ends
of
the
pencil.
it's
going
to
have
to
do
some
erasing
on
category
5,
and
it's
going
to
have
to
do
some
penciling
in
on
category
6.
the
problem
with
the
pbgc,
as
they
state
on...
in
page
20
of
their
brief,
they
admit
that
all
accrued
benefits
vest
on
termination,
and
all
vested
benefits
are
nonforfeitable.
therefore,
all
accrued
benefits
on
termination
must
reside
no
lower
than
category
5.
now,
the
pbgc
tries
to
dance
around
that--
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
--on
termination
only.
that's
correct.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
every
accrued
benefit.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
and
the
pbgc
admits
to
that.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
that's
correct.
all
other
nonforfeitable
benefits
under
the
plan
at
that
point.
one
through
4
is
your
basic
nonforfeitable
benefits.
five
is
all
other
nonforfeitable
benefits,
which
has
been
interpreted
to
mean
benefits
nonforfeitable
solely
by
termination.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
that's
correct,
because
we're
in
6
and
not
5.
the
pbgc
is
saying
that
only
accrued
benefits
occur
in
6.
physical
impossibility.
accrued
benefits
can
go
no
lower
than
5.
since
all
accrued
benefits
are
vested
and
all
vested
benefits
are
nonforfeitable,
all
other
nonforfeitable
benefits
on
termination
occur
in
priority
category
5.
that
leaves
priority
category
6
with
nothing
in
it.
absolutely
nothing.
and
it's
not
like...
congress
considered
putting
accrued
benefits
there.
they
had
it
earlier
in
the
statute.
they've
got
the
word
"accrued"
in
two
of
the
other
priority
categories.
they
knew
what
it
was.
they
just
purposely
left
it
out
in
this
category,
and
for
good
reason.
the
way
that
the
statute
is
drafted
you're
not
going
to
get
any
accrued
benefits
in
priority
category
6.
it's
an
allocation
section.
and
what
it
asks
the
trustee
to
do
is
to
take
the
assets
of
the
plan
and
allocate
them
in
this
fashion.
it's
not
whether
or
not
the
benefits
is
payable,
it's
take
the
assets
under
the
plan
and
allocate
them
in
this
fashion.
and
to
extent
that
there
was
benefits
under
the
plan
to
pay
this
benefit,
they
should
be
allocated
in
number
6,
all
other
benefits,
under
the
plan.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
yes,
but
if
they've
only
worked
for
five
years
you're
talking
about
a
very
small
amount
of
money.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
that's
correct.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
he
should
have
his
share.
that
is
our
position.
now,--
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
--yes.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
oh,
absolutely.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
there--
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
--undisputed.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
two
types
of
benefits.
an
accrued
benefit
which
has
to
apply
to
the
vesting
rules,
and
one
of
the
rules
of
the
vesting
rules...
and
one
of
the
problems
in
this
case
is
that
mead
uses
the
rules
of
an
ongoing
plan
concurrently
with
the
rules
of
a
terminated
plan.
two
different
rules.
in
the
rules
of
a
terminated
plan,
so
vested.
and
so,
if
you
had
six
years
of
credited
service...
service,
you
had
six
years
of
an
accrued
benefit,
you
got
paid
six
years
of
an
accrued
benefit--
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
--when
this
plan
terminated.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
to
the
extent--
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
--to
the
extent
there
are
funds
allocated.
of
course,
there
will
be,
at
that
point,
an
extremely
small
benefit.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
but
it
would
be...
it
would
be
a
benefit.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
yes.
it
would
be
a
benefit
under
the
plan.
it
would
be
funds
allocated.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
it
would
always
be
larger.
that's
correct.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
everyone
with
an
entitlement
to
benefit
who
could
have
possibly
qualified
for
the
early--
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
--retirement
benefit.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
absolutely.
however,
i'd
like
to
state
that
what
we
are
asking
for
is
the
funds
that
would
set
aside
for
that
benefit.
the
funds--
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
--that's
correct.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
your
honor?
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
well,
there
would
be
some
other
claimants
to
this
fund.
but--
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
--okay.
to
the
extent
that
it
is
actuarially
funded.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
that
would
be
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
that
would
be
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
the
fair
market
value
of
that
benefit
at
that
time
would
be
much
less
than
the
full
value
of
the
benefit.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
well,
that's
absolutely
incorrect.
mead
makes--
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
--that
argument.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
no.
to
the
extent
that
there
are
benefits
there
for...
money
set
aside
for
benefit,
it
would
go
under
6.
if
it
was
overfunded,
maybe
we'd
get
the
reversion.
and
mead
makes
the
argument
that
this
particular
law
will
basically
end
trust
law
as
we
know
it,
and
that's
completely
wrong.
one
thing
it
fails
to
point
out,
that
since
1984
this
is
the
law
in
the
united
states
of
america.
the
rea
amendments
basically
enacted
that.
and
he
cite
to
basically
the
pbgc
regulations
which
enact
that
law.
all
we're
dealing
with
is
whether
or
not
this
law
was
the
state
of
the
law
before
the
rea
amendments.
the
idea
that
this
would
completely
end
reversions
is
just
wrong.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
no,
your
honor.
the
rea
amendment,
specifically
in
its
legislative
history,
knew
of
the
conflict
and
they...
the
legislative
history
states
that
we
do
not
take
any
position
on
whether
or
not
this
either
codifies
present
law
or
changes
it.
they
just
took
no
position.
the
present
congress
at
that
time
decided
that
that's
what
they
wanted
the
law
to
be.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
no,
your
honor.
and
that's
something
i
do
want
to
emphasize.
what
the
irs
actually
gives...
what
the
employer
gives
the
irs
is
form
5310.
the
form
5310
has
a
blank
statement
on
it,
"we
have
complied
with
rule
411
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
"
and
based
on
that
blanket
compliance
the
internal
revenue
service,
who
simply
does
not
have
the
manpower
that
it
would
take
to
investigate
all
this,
issues
a
letter
that
the
plan
is
still
qualified.
based
on
that
information.
it
does
not
require
the
employer
to
give
that
detailed
information
of
the
exact
benefit
formula.
and,
similarly,
the
pbgc--
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
--yes.
amato.
the
amato
case
before
this
court.
they
specifically...
in
fact,
the
amato
brief
is
set
forth
in
appendix
to
the
yellow
brief
of
mead,
the
amato
pbgc
brief.
and
in
amato
they
held
that
in
a
pre-rea
case...
they
held
that
this
was
not
permissible.
in
amato,
for
some
reason,
they
did
look
into
it
and
they
did
go
into
it
and
found
that...
they
felt
the
section
411
requirements
were
not
complied
with.
the
basic
issue
for
this
court
is
whether
or
not
they
are
going
to
reward
an
employer
for
terminating
a
pension
plan.
to
give
the
employer
money
that
would
have...
that
was
set
aside
for
benefits,
and
they
would
have
had
to
pay
for
benefits
had
this
plan
continued.
are
you
going
to
give
it
to
the
employees
who
earned
that
money
through
their
years
of
service?
this
is
not
like
the
blessitt
case.
the
blessitt
case
involved
employees
asking
for
benefits
which
they
have
not
yet
earned
through
their
years
of
service.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
prior
to
termination?
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
if
he
has
an
accrued
benefit
that
is
vested,
he
would
get
something.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
if
he
was
not
age
62
and
with
30
years
of
credited
service,
he
would
forfeit
that
benefit.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
that's
correct,
because
the
actuary
takes
into
account
the
fact
that
some
people
will
leave.
mr.
clifford
l.
harrison
and
the
present
value
of
the
benefit,
it
is
a
contingent
benefit,
and
the
plan
is
ongoing...
if
you
leave,
you
get
nothing.
that
is
the
nature
of
the
benefit.
but
on
termination,
mead,
who
had
promised
these
benefits
to
an
employee...
to
employee...
they
should
have
to
pay
the
fair
market
value
of
these
benefits.
after
all,
these
employees
stayed
with
lynchburg
foundry
company
in
cases
up
to
35
years
anticipating
this
benefit.
and,
in
fact,
bernard
tilley,
who
did
not
lose
his
job
as
a
result...
no
one
lost
their
job.
mead
sold
the
company
but
everyone
stayed
in
their
same
desk.
bernard
tilley
is
alive
today
in
this
room
and
retired
at
age
62
from
the
lynchburg
foundry
company
at
the
same
desk
he
had
been
at
for
the
last
35
years.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
