mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
two
questions
for
consideration
by
the
court.
the
first
and
principal
question
is
whether
upon
termination
of
a
pension
plan
the
employee
retirement
income
security
act
of
1974,
erisa,
requires
the
payment
of
subsidized
early
retirement
benefits
before
any
surplus
plan
assets
may
revert
to
the
employer.
we
submit
that
erisa
imposes
no
such
requirement.
but
if
the
court
should
disagree,
then
it
would
be
necessary
for
the
court
to
decide
whether
the
court
below,
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
abused
its
discretion
in
reaching
and
deciding
the
damage
issue,
when
that
issue
was
not
considered
by
the
district
court
and
was
not
raised,
briefed
or
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
factual
background
against
which
the
court
will
decide
this
question
is
relatively
simple.
the
respondents
are
six
former
salaried
employees
of
the
petitioner,
of
the
lynchburg
foundry
company,
formerly
a
previously...
excuse
me,
a
wholly-owned
subsidiary
of
the
petitioner.
they
were
participants
in
a
salaried
employees
retirement
plan,
which
was
a
tax-qualified,
single
employer,
defined
benefit
plan
funded
entirely
by
mead.
under
the
terms
of
the
plan,
normal
retirement
benefits
became
payable
at
age
65.
employees
became
entitled
to
actuarially
reduced
early
retirement
benefits
at
age
55.
and
employees
became
entitled
to
subsidized
early
retirement
benefits
if
they
had
attained
age
62
and
completed
30
years
of
service
at
the
time
they
severed
their
employment
with
petitioner.
this
benefit
was
subsidized
in
the
sense
that
there
was
no
actuarial
reduction
for
the
early
commencement
for
the
benefits.
in
1983,
petitioner
sold
the
foundry,
severed
the
employment
of
the
respondents,
and
terminated
the
plan.
employees
who
had
satisfied
the
requirements
for
receiving
normal
or
subsidized
early
retirement
benefits,
received
those
benefits.
all
employees
who
were
ineligible
for
such
benefits
received
their
normal
retirement
benefit,
payable
at
age
65,
based
upon
their
completed
years
of
service
on
the
date
of
plan
termination.
in
other
words,
the
actuarial
value
of
the
normal
retirement
benefit.
the
respondents
were
in
this
latter
group.
five
had
completed
30
years
of
service
but
had
not
attained
age
62.
one
had
28
years
of
service
and
was
only
age
61
at
the
time
of
plan
termination.
prior
to
the
actual
termination
of
the
plan,
mead
requested
and
received
from
the
pension
benefit
guaranty
corporation
a
notice
of
sufficiency
of
assets.
the
irs
subsequently
issued
a
favorable
determination
letter
indicating
the
termination
of
the
plan
did
not
affect
its
tax-qualified
status.
having
satisfied
all
liabilities
of
the
plan,
mead
then
took
a
reversion
of
approximately
$10.7
million,
as
provided
by
the
terms
of
the
plan.
this
suit
followed,
respondents
claiming
that
mead
should
have
paid
subsidized
early
retirement
benefits
before
any
surplus
plan
assets
could
revert
to
the
petitioner.
on
cross-motions
for
partial
summary
judgment,
the
district
court
held
that
the
petitioner
was
not
required
to
make
payment
of
such
benefits
because
they
were
not
accrued
benefits
within
the
meaning
of
erisa
and
the
respondents
had
not
satisfied
all
terms
and
conditions
of
the
plan.
the
fourth
circuit
reversed,
holding
that
upon
plan
termination,
erisa
required
payment
of
these
subsidies
even
if
those
benefits
were
not
accrued
benefits
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
and
even
though
respondents
had
not
satisfied
all
conditions
under
the
plan
for
the
receipt
of
such
benefits.
for
its
sole
statutory
authority,
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
section
4044(a)(6)
of
erisa,
which
ranks
the
order
in
which
assets
must
be
allocated
upon
plan
termination
among
six
categories,
the
last
being
the
payment
of
all
other
benefits
under
the
plan.
in
construing
this
category
to
create
a
substantive
right
to
recover
subsidized
early
retirement
benefits,
the
court
below
relied
upon
amato
against
western
union,
where
the
second
circuit
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
limit
this
allegation
category
to
accrued
benefits
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
but,
instead,
intended
that,
if
assets
were
available,
they
should
be
paid
to
meet
the
participant's
benefit
expectations
under
the
plan.
the
court
below
then
calculated
the
amount
due
each
respondent
by
taking
a
five
percent
actuarial
reduction
for
each
year
that
the
individual
is
under
the
early
retirement
age
at
the
time
of
plan
termination.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
five
of
the
respondents.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
i
think
not,
your
honor.
to
begin
with,
a
benefit
can
be
earned
only
under
the
terms
of
the
plan.
if
it
is
a
benefit
which
is
mandated
by
erisa
to
be
paid,
it
must
be
an
accrued
benefit.
under
the
terms
of
this
plan,
there
were
two
conditions
for
the
receipt
of
early
retirement
benefits.
the
employee
had
to
have
30
years
of
service
and
reach
age
62
in
service.
now,
once
you
make
either
the
age
or
service
expectations
of
the
participants,
rather
than
the
terms
of
the
plan,
the
touchstone
of
liability,
there
is
no
way
for
determining
what
the
obligations
of
the
plan
are,
and
i
submit
there
is
no
reason
for
disregarding
the
terms
of
one
condition
and
not
another.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
the
third
circuit,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
that's
correct.
in
dissent.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
the
majority
opinion
in
that
court...
in
that
case,
as
i'm
sure
your
honor
is
aware,
held
that
subsidized
early
retirement
benefits
were
not
accrued
benefits
within
the
meaning
of
erisa.
but,
coming
back
to
your
original
question,
you
cannot
have
the
age
or
the
service
expectation
of
the
participant
determine
the
liability
of
the
plan
regardless
of
the
terms
of
the
plan.
in
this
case,
it
was
an
age-in-service
expectation
that
we're
being
asked
to
ignore.
in
another
case
it
may
be
a
service
requirement,
as
was
the
case
in
the
blessitt
case
in
the
eleventh
circuit.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
i'm
sorry,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
an
accrued
non-vested
benefit
would
be
the
example
of
an
employee
under
this
plan,
which
contains
a
10-year
cliff
vesting
provision,
who
had
been
in
the
employ
of
mead
for
nine
years.
if
that
employee
leaves
at
nine
years,
he
had
an
accrued
benefit,
but
it
was
unvested.
he
gets
nothing.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
it
began
to
accrue
upon
the
moment
he
became
eligible
to
participate
in
the
plan.
but
it
was
an
accrued
benefit
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
not
a
subsidized
benefit.
what
was
accruing
under
the
terms
of
the
plan
at
that
time
was
the
annual
benefit
commencing
at
normal
retirement
age,
not
a
subsidized
early
retirement
benefit.
because,
if
there
is
anything
that
is
clear
in
this
case,
it's
that
congress
in
1974
specifically
decided
not
to
include
the
subsidized
early
retirement
benefit
in
the
term
"accrued
benefit"
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
that's
correct,
your
honor,
under
section
411(b).
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
that's
right,
your
honor.
anyone
who
had
satisfied
the
requirements
for
the
normal
retirement
benefit,
which
in
effect
was
reaching
65,
received
that
benefit.
that
benefit
has
to
be
nonforfeitable
under
the
statute.
those
who
had
not
attained
that
age
but
had
vested
benefits,
received
an
actuarially
reduced
value
of
their
normal
retirement
benefit,
based
upon
their
years.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
those
are
the
only
benefits
that
accrue
under
the
statute.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
yes,
your
honor.
any
time
an
employee
reaches
the
10-year
cliff
vesting
provision
in
the
plan--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--all
benefits
that
have
accrued
become
vested
and
nonforfeitable
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
i
think
not,
your
honor.
under
section
401(a)(2)
of
the
revenue
code--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--which
has
been
in
place
since
1938--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--upon
plan
termination,
the
plan
sponsor
must
satisfy
all
plan
liabilities
before
there
can
be
any
reversion
of
surplus
assets
to
the
employer.
the
treasury
regulation
implementing
that
section
of
the
code
provides
that
that
requires
payment
of
all
fixed
and
contingent
liabilities.
and
the
irs
in
a
series
of
revenue
rulings,
dating
from
the
late
'30s
and
early
'40s,
has
defined
contingent
liabilities
as
benefit
credits
accrued
up
to
the
time
of
termination.
now,
as
a
matter
of
administrative
practice--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--well,
prior--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--prior
to
erisa,
your
honor,
it
was
only
the
benefit
that
accrued
under
the
plan
which
determined...
which
was
based
upon
the
terms
of
the
plan.
since
erisa,
it
is
only
the
accrued
benefit...
i
don't
mean
to
circular...
which
accrues
over
the
life
of
the
plan
and
the
service
of
the
employee.
but
what
the
irs
required
pre-erisa
as
a
matter
of
administrative
practice,
was
that
employers
treat
benefits
which
accrued
ratably
under
the
terms
of
their
plan
as
contingent
liabilities,
which
then
had
to
be
vested
and
satisfied
upon
plan
termination.
now,
the
same
thing
happens
now,
but
by
operation
of
law,
section
411(d)(3)
of
the
code.
under
that
provision,
and
the
corresponding
provision
in
erisa,
the
accrued
benefit
which
has
not
vested,
which
is
a
contingent
liability
within
the
meaning
of
the
irs
rulings,
must
vest
upon
termination
of
the
plan.
so,
the
contingent
liability,
up
until
the
time
of
plan
termination,
is
converted
into
a
fixed
liability
and
must
be
paid
by
reason
of
411(d)(3)
of
the
code.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
yes,
sir.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
i'd
be
happy
to
do
that,
justice
scalia.
the
accrued
benefit
is
defined
in
section
323(a)
of
erisa
and
section
411(a)(7)
of
the
code
as,...
and
i
quote,
"the
employee's
accrued
benefit
under
the
plan
and,
except
as
provided
in
section
(c)(3),
expressed
in
the
form
of
an
annual
benefit
commencing
at
normal
retirement
age.
"
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
no.
the
benefit
commencing
at
normal
retirement
age.
but
you
will
note
the
exception,
subsection
(c)(3),
and
that's
what
the
plan
administrator
in
this
case
had
to
look
to
because
these
employees
were
being
taken
out
with
lump-sum
cash
distributions.
they
were
not
waiting
until
they
reached
age
65
to
receive
the
normal
retirement
benefit.
subsection
(c)(3)
instructs
that
when
the
accrued
benefit--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--excuse
me,
your
honor.
that
appears
in
our
brief
appendix
at
page
5.
you
will
see
in
the--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--appendix
to
the
blue
brief
on
page
4
we
have
set
forth
section
323(a),
411(a)(7)
of
the
code,
and
then
411(c)(3)
appears
in
the
appendix
at
page
5.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
subsection
(c)(3),
which
the
definition,
justice
scalia,
of
the
accrued
benefit
refers
the
reader
to,
instructs
that
when
the
accrued
benefit
is
to
be
determined
as
an
amount
other
than
an
annual
benefit
commencing
at
normal
retirement
age,
then
the
accrued
benefit
shall
be
the
actuarial
equivalent
of
such
benefit.
the
actuarial
equivalent
of
a
benefit
commencing
at
normal
retirement
age
necessarily
excludes
subsidized
early
retirement
benefits
because
such
benefits,
by
definition,
are
commencing
prior
to
normal
retirement
age.
treasury
regulation
1.411(a)-(7),
which
is
cited
and
quoted
on
pages
32
and
33
of
the
blue...
of
the
blue
brief,
i
think
makes
this
very
clear
and
confirms
that
a
subsidized
early
retirement
benefit
provided
by
the
plan
is
not
taken...
is
not
to
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
the
accrued
benefit
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
example
1
to
that
regulation,
which
is
set
forth
on
pages
32
and
33,
provides...
and
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
read
it
because
i
think
this
is
this
case.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
of
our
brief
on
the
merits,
your
honor.
the
brief
i
believe
you
have
before
you.
now,
bear
in
mind
we
started
with
the
definition
of
accrued
benefit
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
that
definition
takes
us
to
411
subsection
(c)(3).
now,
the
regulation
implementing
that
section
in
example
1,
and
this
is
an
example
of
how
you
determine
the
normal
retirement
benefit,
provides...
plan
a
provides
for
a
benefit
equal
to
1
percent
of
high
five
years'
compensation
for
each
year
of
service
and
a
normal
retirement
age
of
65.
the
plan
also
provides
for
a
full
unreduced,
accrued
benefit
without
any
actuarial
reduction
for
any
employee
at
age
55
with
30
years
of
service.
that's
the
mead
plan.
even
though
the
actuarial
value
of
the
early
retirement
benefit
could
exceed
the
value
of
the
benefit
at
the
normal
retirement
age,
the
normal
retirement
benefit
would
not
include
the
greater
value
of
the
early
retirement
benefit
because
actuarial
subsidies
are
ignored.
and
that
is
exactly
the
kind
of
situation
that
we
have
in
this
case.
and
i
submit
that
the
language
of
the
statute
and
the
implementing
regulation
interpreting
that
language
read
this
way
and
are
structured
this
way
because
congress
specifically
addressed
this
issue
in
1974.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
while
you
can
say
it
may
be
an
accumulating
benefit,
it
is
certainly
not
an
accrued
benefit
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
your
honor.
and
it
is
only
the
accrued
benefit--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--no,
it
would
not
be
imprecise
to
say
that
it
is
unaccrued.
a
benefit
of
this
kind
becomes
earned
all
at
once,
when
both
conditions
for
the
receipt
of
the
benefits
are
satisfied.
this
is
very
clear
and
i
think
confirmed
from
the
legislative
history.
the
senate,
back
in
1974,
proposed
a
version
of
erisa
which
took
the
subsidized
early
retirement
benefit
into
account
in
determining
what
would
be
the
accrued
benefit.
and
we
have
to
bear
in
mind
the
accrued
benefit
is
the
benefit
that
this
statute
surrounds
with
all
of
the
protection,
the
minimum
standards
that
congress
required
any
plan
sponsor
meet.
the
house
disagreed.
the
administration
disagreed
because
it
old
not
want
to
deter
employers
from
providing
such
benefits
and
wanted
to
maintain
the
cost
of
maintaining
defined
benefit
plans
of
the
kind
that
we
have
here.
the
quotation
from
the
house
committee
on
education
and
labor,
which
appears
on
page
33
of
our
brief,
i
think
makes
it
very
clear
what
the
house
position
was.
the
conference
committee
chose
the
house
version
and
in
the
conference
report
said
very
clearly,
and
i
quote,
"the
accrued
benefit
does
not
include
the
value
of
the
right
to
receive
early
retirement
benefits.
"
now,
the
effect
of
this
1974
congressional
choice,
i
submit,
was
to
exclude
subsidized
early
retirement
benefits
from
the
accrued
benefit
under
erisa
and
all
the
protections
that
statute
provides,
including
that
of
section
4111(c)(3)
which
requires
that
accrued
benefits
become
vested
and
payable
upon
plan
termination.
they
are
not
accrued
benefits
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
they
do
not
vest
upon
plan
termination
and,
therefore,
are
not
payable.
your
honors,
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
address
the
issue
which
really
goes
to
the
only
basis
for
the
holding
of
the
court
below,
which
is
that
section
4044(a)(6)
of
erisa
creates
substantive
rights
to
the
payment
of
subsidized
early
retirement
benefits.
section
4044
is
entitled
allocation
of
assets.
i
submit
there
is
nothing
in
the
language
of
the
statute,
there
is
nothing
in
the
implementing
regulations
of
the
statute,
there
is
nothing
in
the
structure
of
the
statute,
and
there
certainly
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
which
indicates
that
congress
intended
to
do
anything
in
this
provision
other
than
to
rank
the
order
in
which
the
assets
of
a
plan
generally
with
insufficient
assets
should
be
put
upon
termination
of
a
plan.
section
4044(a)(b)
is
the
last
of
these
categories.
it
requires
the
plan
administrator
to
allocate
assets
to
satisfy,
and
i
quote,
"all
other
benefits
under
the
plan.
"
now,
a
benefit
can
be
earned
under
the
plan
only
if
it
satisfies
the
criteria
of
the
plan.
here
the
conditions
outlined
by
the
plan
for
the
receipt
of
the
subsidized
early
retirement
benefit
were
not
satisfied.
while
five
of
the
respondents
did
have
30
years
of
service,
they
had
not
attained
age
62
in
the
service
of
mead.
the
fifth
had
28
years
of
service,
but
was
61
years
of
age
at
the
time
the
plan
terminated.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
it
six
creates
new
rights...
and
i
think
it
would
be
strange
indeed
if
it
did
when
congress
made
it
very
clear
that
the
only
benefit
that
was
to
be
surrounded
by
the
protection
of
the
statute
was
the
accrued
benefit...
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes.
but
i
think
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
here,
justice
scalia,
that
congress
in
writing
this
statute
was
endeavoring
to
embrace
and
to
enforce
the
terms
of
these
plans,
not
to
rewrite
them
or
to
disregard
them.
and
i
submit
if
the
congress
in
this
allocation
category
intended
to
create
a
whole
new
category
of
substantive
rights
based
upon
benefit
expectations,
it
would
have
said
so
in
the
statute.
and
i
think
there
would
be
some
indication
in
the
legislative
history.
i
can't
think
congress
intended
that.
i
don't
think
congress
said
that.
and
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
congress
wasn't
even
thinking
about
doing
that
in
section
4044(a)(6).
now,
the
court
below
found
some
comfort
in
the
second
circuit's
interpretation
of
the
legislative
history
of
section
4044(a),
the
interpretation
that
the
second
circuit
put
on
the
legislative
history
in
the
amato
case.
there
the
court
attached
a
great
deal
of
significance
to
the
fact
that
the
adjective
accrued
was
eliminated
from
the
fourth
category
of
the
house
bill.
but
the
fourth
category
of
the
house
bill
is
in
no
way
an
analog
for
category
6
of
section
4044(a).
the
closest
analog
to
category
6
in
the
predecessor
bills
was
section
112(d)(2)
of
the
house
bill.
that
was
a
provision
for
the
payment
of
other
benefits
that
vest
upon...
not
that
vest,
that
are
payable
upon
plan
termination.
the
first
indication
that
i
can
see
in
the
legislative
history
for
a
predecessor
to
category
6
is
in
the
administration's
recommendations
to
the
conferees.
there,
the
administration
recommended
that
there
be
a
category
of
this
time.
and
the
bill
emerges
from
conference
with
this
catchall
provision.
so,
elimination
of
the
adjective
accrued
from
a
section
in
the
predecessor
house
bill
that
really
is
not
the
closest
analog
to
category
(a)(6)
proves
very
little.
in
fact,
i
submit
it
proves
nothing
as
to
what
category
6
was
intended
to
embrace.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
yes,
justice--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--that's
correct.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
i
think
this
related
to
the
question
asked
earlier
by
justice
o'connor.
it
we
look
at
the
implementing
regulations
and
revenue
rulings
with
respect
to
401
(a)(2)
of
the
code,
which
is
really
the
genesis
of
the
contingent
liability
language,
the
code
merely
provides
that
all
liabilities
be
satisfied.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
the
irs
has
said
that
that
means
both
fixed
and
contingent
liabilities.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
the
examples
given
repeatedly
by
the
irs
are
benefits
that
accrue
ratably
under
the
terms
of
a
plan.
that's
pre-erisa.
and
as
a
matter
of
administrative
practice
pre-erisa,
the
irs
would
insist
that
the
employer
treat
benefits
which
accrued
ratably
under
the
terms
of
the
plan
as
the
accrued
benefit,
post-erisa,
and
require
that
they
vest
and
be
paid
upon
termination.
now
the
same
thing
happens
by
operation
of
law,
your
honor.
under
section
411(d)(3)
of
the
code,
the
accrued
benefit,
which
is
now
a
defined
term
of
erisa,
is
the
only
benefit
that
must
vest
upon
termination
of
the
pension
plan.
and
i
think
the
irs
interpretation
of
this
section
in
the
implementing
regulations
supports
this
position.
the
irs
in
this
case
issued
a
favorable
determination
letter.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
i
think
the
best
place
to
look
in
the
plan,
your
honor,
would
be
article
viii,
which
provides
for
benefits
upon
termination
of
employment.
you
will
note
that
in
that
article
of
the
plan,
which
does
appear
in
the
joint
appendix
here,
the
only
benefits
that
survive
termination
of
employment,
if
you
will,
are
the
vested
early
retirement
benefit
and
the
vested
normal
retirement
benefit.
and
that
has
to
be
put
in
the
context
of
termination
of
employment,
not
just
termination
of
the
plan.
but
there
is
no
provision
there,
as
there
is
in
article
v,
section
2(b)
for
the
payment
of
subsidized
early
retirement
benefits
after
separation
from
employment
and
reaching
the
required
age.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
absolutely,
your
honor.
that
employee
would--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--your
honor,
they
were
not
in
that
very
posture.
as
i
understood
your
example,
it
was
an
individual
who
had
attained
age
63--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--and
30
years
of
service.
that
individual
would
have
earned
that
benefit
under
the
plan.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
it
would
be
a
liability
of
the
plan
and
would
be
payable
on
termination.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
with
respect
to
that
benefit,
that's
correct.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
there
is
no
contingent
liability.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
because
that
benefit,
your
honor,
is
not
earned
until
both
conditions
of
the
plan
are
satisfied.
and
if
the
termination--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--the
sponsor
always
funds
for
benefits
that
are
projected
liabilities
of
the
plan,
whether
or
not
they
are
going
to
be
earned.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
not
because
they're
contingent
liabilities
but
because
many
of
them
never
will
be
earned.
this
is
the
afl-cio
argument,
and
it
proves
too
much.
in
a
defined
benefit
plan,
an
employer
working
on
the
basis
of
actuarial
assumptions
will
fund
for
all
projected
liabilities
of
the
plan,
many
of
which
will
never
be
earned.
the
actuary
takes
into
account
the
fact
that
there
are
going
to
be
deaths,
they're
going
to
terminate--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--no.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
not
at
that
point.
the
only--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--because
the
only
liability
which
accrues
after
erisa
is
the
accrued
benefit.
when
you
are
funding
a
defined
benefit
plan,
justice
stevens,
you
do
it
on
an
aggregate
basis
and
not
for
the
benefit
of
any
individuals.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
and
the
assumptions
take
into
account
that
employees
a,
c,
f
and
g
may
leave.
some
may
die.
some
may
advance
into
other
ranks
in
management
of
the
company.
and
to
say
that
because
you
are
funding
for
the
possibility
of
paying
a
liability
that
may
never
be
earned,
that
therefore
that
becomes
an
accrued
benefit,
proves
entirely--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--that's
correct.
by
operation
of
law.
the
contingent--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--on
the
day
before
the
plan,
all
benefits
that
had
been
accruing
ratably
under
section
411(b),
which
is
the
accrued
benefit--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--were
contingent
liabilities.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
no
they
weren't.
not
until
they
were
vested.
and
it
the
employee
had
not
served
ten
years
of
credited
service--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--all
of
those
who
served
more
than
10
years--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--do
have
vested
rights.
that's
correct.
the
contingent
liabilities
were
the
unvested
accrued
benefits
to
that
point
in
time.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
thank
you,
your
honor.
