non-vested
benefit?
justice
anthony
m.

is
there
a
paradigmatic
example
of
an
accrued
non-vested
benefit?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when
did
it
begin
to
accrue?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
not
saying
that's
unaccrued.
you're
just
saying
it's
an
accrued
benefit
of
a
different
sort?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
would
be
imprecise
to
say
that
it's
unaccrued?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
there
an
amicus
brief
by
the
government
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
who
represented
them?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
doesn't
your
argument
make
the
rea
amendment
a
nullity?
