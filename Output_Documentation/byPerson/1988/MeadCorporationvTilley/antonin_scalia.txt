mr.
mccartan,--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why...
show
me
where
in
the
statute
the
ordinary
retirement
benefits
accrue
but
the
early
retirement
benefits
don't
accrue.
i...
i
don't
see
in
the
definition
of
accrued
benefit
any
language
that
would
lead
me
ineluctably
to
that
conclusion.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
relying
on
that
phrase,
normal
retirement
age?
is
that
what
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
if
you
agree
that
(a)(b)
does
create
new
rights,
then
you'd
be
out
of
the...
it
wouldn't
be
tied
to
accrual
or
not,
so
all
of
your
other
analyses
would
indeed
be
irrelevant.
so
that
is
crucial.
i
mean,
you
would
acknowledge
that
if
six
creates
new
rights,
all
it
says
is
all
other
benefits,
it
doesn't
say
accrued--
justice
antonin
scalia
were
they
required
to
accumulate
in
order
to
pay
that
benefit?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
so?
justice
antonin
scalia
where...
where
is
that
provided?
does
it
say
specifically
you
will
fund
early
retirement
benefits?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
are
they
funding...
when
you
say
they
are
funding
it...
for
every
employee
who
is
currently
on
the
payroll?
are
they
setting
aside
enough
money
that
if
that
employee
stays
until
he's
63
and
until
he's
had
30
years,
they'll
have
money
for
him?
or,
rather,
do
they
just
have
to
put
aside
enough
money
that
on
the
basis
of
experience
that
number
of
people
who
normally
would
do
that,
stay
that
long
and
reach
that
age,
would
be
covered?
which
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
clearly
the
latter?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
quite
a
bit
different
then,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
harrison,
can
i
pursue
the
line
of
questioning--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
started
earlier
as
to
what
is
set
aside
under...
under
the
the
erisa
rules.
for
people
who
have
cliff
vested,
they've
been
there
10
years--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
required
that
for
each
individual
you
have
to
set
aside
each
year
a
specific
allocable
amount
of
money
because--
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay.
for
people
who
have
not
yet
cliff
vested,
employees
who
are
there
but
haven't
yet
been
there
10
years,
you
don't
set
aside
any
particular
amount
for
each
individual,
do
you?
you
just...
but
you
have
to
set
aside
something
on
the
basis
of
how
many
of
those
people
are
likely
to
hang
around
for
10
years.
isn't
that
what's
done?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
they
get
that
on
termination--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
they
haven't
cliff
vested?
i
thought
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--under
5.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
thought
it
was
not
accrued
until
you're
there
for
10
years?
i'm
talking
about
people
who...
i'm
talking
about
people
who
haven't
been
there
for
10
years
yet.
now,
i
thought
you
told
me
that
you
are
not
setting
aside
for
each
of
them
a
certain
amount
of
money
every
year.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
just
setting
aside
an
amount
that
will
cover
the
number
of
them
that
are
likely
to
stay
ten
years
and,
therefore,
to
be
entitled
to
the
plan's
benefit.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
every
accrued
benefit
is
nonforfeitable?
justice
antonin
scalia
on
termination--
justice
antonin
scalia
--on
termination
only?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
nonforfeitable
there
mean
nonforfeitable
on
termination,
presumably?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is...
which
will...
nobody
will
get
anywhere
near
the
full
amount.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
you're
assuming
that
90
percent
of
them
will
leave
before...
before
the
early
retirement
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wouldn't...
it
wouldn't
pay
an
employer
to
have
such
a
plan
then
because
that
means
that
any
surpluses...
even
though
these
people
have
no
entitlement
to
this
money...
you
say
it's
likely
not
to
be
there...
any
surpluses
in
the
fund,
because
of
conservative
accounting
practices
on,
on,
on
the
other
matters,
all
those
surpluses
will
go
to
these
people.
the
employer
will
never
get
them
back.
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
isn't
that
what
happens?
it...
it
comes
in
under,
under
and
the
employer
doesn't
get
the
reversion
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
haven't
checked
out
one
of
these
cases?
do
you
know
of
one
case
where
they've
gotten
an
employer
for
this
violation?
