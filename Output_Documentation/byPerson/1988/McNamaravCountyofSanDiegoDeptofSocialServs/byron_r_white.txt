what
were
your
claims
below?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
a
due
process
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
did
press
equal
protection
claims
below?
justice
byron
r.
white
including
equal
protection?
justice
byron
r.
white
right,
all
right,
thank
you.
but
you...
did
you
raise
or
did
you
not
raise
equal
protection
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
supreme
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
rely
on
the
fact
that
it
was
actually...
the
equal
protection
claim
was
actually
adjudicated
in
the
california
supreme
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
therefore
you
are
entitled
to
bring
it
here,
even
if
it
wasn't
raised
prior
to
that
time.
justice
byron
r.

and
from
then
on
was
he
deprived
of
the
chance
of
doing
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
whom,
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
the
county?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
placing
the
child
with
an
adoption--
justice
byron
r.
white
--was
he
denied
any
visitation
rights
during
that
period?
justice
byron
r.
white
may
a...
can
a
mother
be
deprived,
have
her
parental
rights
taken
away
by...
just
on
a
best-interests-of-the-child
basis?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it
requires
some
finding
of
unfitness?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about,
how
about
constitutionally?
would
it
violate
the
constitution
to
terminate
parental
rights
just
on
the
basis
of
the
best
interests
of
the
child
without
any
finding
of
unfitness?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
was
a
remand,
wasn't
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
was
a
remand,
so
it
really
isn't...
the
case
wasn't
over
yet.
so
you
have
to
find
some
excuse
for
saying
it
was
final.
and
after
all,
the
father
could
have
prevailed
on
remand
and
won
his
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
would
have
been
no
judgment
at
all
to
review.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
remanded
to
determine
a--
justice
byron
r.
white
--yes.
well,
he
could
have
prevailed
in
the
whole
case
on
that
very
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
federal
issue
would
have
no
longer
been
in
the
case.
