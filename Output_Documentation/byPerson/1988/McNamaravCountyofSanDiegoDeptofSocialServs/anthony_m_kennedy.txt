justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
are
the
constitutional
purposes
served
by
requiring
that
hearing?
i
take
it
you
concede
that
that
hearing
is
constitutionally
required?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
and
what
values
are
served
by
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
your
position
goes
further
than
that.
suppose
in
this
case
we
stipulate
that
the
father
did
everything
that
he
could
have
done,
isn't
your
position
exactly
the
same,
that
the
natural
father
is
in
a
different
category
than
presumed
fathers?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
then
why
don't
you
argue
the
case
on
that...
that's
what
the
case
is
about,
isn't
it?
