justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
if
he
had
initiated
the
kind
of
proceeding
you
describe
in,
say,
august
17
when
he
decided
he
did
want
custody,
if
he
had
initiated
that
proceeding
and
he
had
been
able
to
prove
that
he
was
a
fit
parent,
would
he
have
prevailed
under
california
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
would
he...
he
would
have
had
to
prove
it
was
in
the
best
interests
of
the
child
to
be
with
him
at
that
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
the
issue
have
been
any
different
in
that
proceeding
than
in
this
proceeding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
is
it
significant
if...
why
is
that
significant
at
all?
if
the
test
is
simply
best
interests
of
the
child,
why
couldn't
the
court
at
that
time
have
said
we
think
the
child
is
better
off
with
the
adoptive
parents?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
how?
he
wouldn't
have
gotten
custody
right
away,
would
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
the
judge
have
given
it
to...
under
your
view,
would
it
have
been
up
to
the
judge
to
give
it
to
him?
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
the
county
agency
is
saying
we
think
the
child
is
better
off
with
the
adopting
parents,
and
that's
where
the
mother
wants
the
child?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
position
of
the
county
was
the
child
was
better
off
with
the
adoptive
parents.
justice
john
paul
stevens
wouldn't
they
have
taken
the
same
position
on
august
17
or
18th?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there's
one
inaction:
he
didn't
file
that
lawsuit
right
away.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
can't
find
it
in
the
appendix
here,
but
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--do
you
become
a
presumed
father
by
marrying
after
the
birth
of
the
child?
justice
john
paul
stevens
any
limit
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
clear
this
up
for
me.
he
became
a...
he
would
have
become
a
presumed
father
by
filing
the
filiation
proceeding,
by
offering
to
marry
the
mother,
or
by
doing
both?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
say
he
offered.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
she
says
no,
than--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
but
he...
that
option
wasn't
open
to
him
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
marrying
her
wasn't
open
to
him
because
she
didn't
want
to
marry
him.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
but
did...
would
institution
of
the
filiation
proceeding
have
made
him
a
presumed
father?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
no,
just
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
there
really
was
no
way
he
could
become
a
presumed
father
on
these
facts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
on
that
point,
mr.
harmon,
did
you
argue
that
in
your
brief,
7006(c)?
