we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
87-5840,
edward
mcnamara
v.
the
county
of
san
diego
department
of
adoptions.
mr.
sutherland,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
second
paragraph
of
that
footnote
does
mention
equal
protection,
right
down
towards
the
bottom
of
45a.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
a
quote--
--that's
described,
that's
a
quote
from
caban.
--from
another
case.
just
all
a
description
of
another
case.
i
don't
see
in
the
text
of
the
opinion
any
discussion
of,
you
know,
the
difference
between
the
mother
and
the
father.
that's
what
we're
talking
about
here,
aren't
we,
treating
the
mother
differently
from
the
father,
and
i
fall
to
see
any
discussion
of
it
in
the
california
opinion,
and
you
acknowledge
you
never
raised
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
are
going
to
recess
in
about
three
minutes
for
lunch.
why
don't
you
proceed
with
the
rest
of
your
argument,
and
perhaps
you'll
have
something
to
say
about
that
point
when
we
resume
at
1:00
o'clock.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
was
the
child
born?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
what,
he
hadn't
seen
the
mother
from
november
of
1980
till
july
of
1981?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock,
mr.
sutherland.
we
will
resume
the
argument
in
no.
87-5840,
mcnamara
v.
county
of
san
diego
department
of
adoptions.
mr.
sutherland?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
sutherland,
your
complaint
is
that
your
client
is
denied
equal
protection
both
with
respect
to
other
fathers
and
with
respect
to
the
unwed
mother?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
say
there's
no
reasonable
basis
for
treating
an
unwed
father
differently
than
an
unwed
mother
in
this
situation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
my
question
was
you
say
there's
no
reasonable
basis
for
treating
an
unwed
father
differently
than
an
unwed
mother.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
it
would
be
any
more
amorphous
than
the
area
you're
asking
us
to
walk
into
on
kind
of
a
case-by-case
determination
as
to
when
an
unwed
father
can
have
his
rights
cut
off?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
isn't
that
for
the
state
to
decide,
though,
if
there
are
all
these
ideas
floating
around,
why
isn't
it
reasonable
for
the
state
to
choose
one
or
the
other
as
california
has
done
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that's
certainly
a
determination
of
state
policy.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that
really
begs
the
question.
none
of
our
cases
hold
that
a
father
in
your
client's
position
has
achieved
a
protected
liberty
interest.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
sutherland.
mr.
harmon,
we
will
hear
now
from
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
almost
the
converse
of
finality,
to
say
that
you
must
come
immediately
to
this
court
if
you
possibly
could.
have
we
ever
held
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
caban,
though,
the
role
of
the
father
was
a
good
deal
more
passive
than
it
was
here,
wasn't
it?
i
mean--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--it
was
in
lehr
that
the
father's
role
had
been
very
[inaudible].
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
your
answers
to
justice
stevens'
question
indicated
that
this
particular
appellant
could
not
have,
other
than
marrying
the
mother.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
could
this
fellow
have
put
himself,
brought
himself
within
the
presumed
father
status?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
was
he
to
do
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
what
would
a
filiation
proceeding
have
given
him?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
harmon.
mr.
sutherland,
you
have
six
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
the
trial
itself
lasted
three--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sutherland.
the
case
is
submitted.
