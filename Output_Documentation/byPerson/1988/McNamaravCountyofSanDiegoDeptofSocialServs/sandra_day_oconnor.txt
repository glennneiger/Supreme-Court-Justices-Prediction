justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
what,
before
what
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now,
you
are
not
raising
a
substantive
due
process
claim
here
before
us,
i
take
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
if
it
had
been
a
so-called
one
night
stand?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
would
certainly
go
substantially
beyond
any
of
this
court's
cases,
wouldn't
it,
where
there
has
been
an
established
relationship.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
you
find
anything
other
than
that
footnote?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
state
has
done
that
here
by
effectively
providing
a
mechanism
for
cutting
off
a
biological
father's
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
they've
adopted
it
as
a
policy
that
the
state
will
consider
the
best
interests
of
the
child
over
the
alleged
rights
of
the
biological
father,
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
the
state
has
some
interest
here
in
promptly
placing
illegitimately
born
newborns
in
stable
family
homes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
by
the
time
that
hearing
came
up,
is
it
possible
that
the
bonding
had
already
taken
place
of
the
baby
with
the
adoptive
parent?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
harmon,
the
substantive
due
process
issue
is
not
what
the
petitioner
raises
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
apparently
california
has
chosen
to
require
at
least
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
if
the
father
is
known,
is
that
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
think
it's
hard
for
you
to
argue
that
the
father
didn't
do
everything
he
could
do,
and
the
state
courts
seem
to
have
so
held.
i
think
we
are
better
off
addressing
the
question
rather
than
going
off
on
some
theory
that
he
didn't
do
all
that
he
could
do
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
am
i
mistaken,
or
did
the
courts
below
find
that
he
had
done
what
he
could
do?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
wouldn't
they
have
applied
exactly
the
same
standard
as
they
did
here,
the
best
interests
of
the
child?
i
don't
see
how
that
would
have
altered
his
position
at
all.
