mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
first
i
would
like
to
address
the
issue
what
does
the
1984
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court
actually
hold
with
regard
to
these
federal
constitutional
issues,
and
i
think
in
all
candor
we
have
to
say
that
the
decision
and
the
discussion
in
that
case
is
not
as
precise
as
we
would
have
liked
it
to
be.
however,
we
do
believe
that
it
certainly
hit
the
substantive
due
process
issue
head
on
and
that
it
did
conclude
that
the
california
statutory
scheme
did
not
violate
federal--
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
--yes,
that
also
baffles
us
a
little
bit
because
if
you
look
at
his
opening
brief,
the
argument
is,
of
course,
that
edward
has
a
protected
liberty
interest.
he
cites
all
the
cases
that
are
traditionally
discussed
in
substantive
due
process
cases,
and
on
page
21
of
that
brief
he
says
termination
of
parental
rights
interferes
with
a
"fundamental
liberty
interest".
so
as
you
will
note
from
the
brief
that
we
filed,
we
talk
about
substantive
due
process
and
we
talk
about
equal
protection,
but
from
our
vantage
point
there's
no
question
in
our
mind
that
the
california
supreme
court
dealt
with
the
substantive
due
process
issue.
with
respect
to
the
equal
protection
issue,
again,
footnote
8
is
the
only
place
that
you
really
find
any
discussion
of
equal
protection,
and
as
has
been
pointed
out,
that's
in
a
quotation.
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
well,
it
certainly
does
not
have
any
discussion
of
the
equal
protection
issue.
there's...
we
don't
dispute
that.
in
looking
at
the
decision
as
phrased
by
the
california
supreme
court,
we
were
of
the
view
that
in
citing
caban,
which
is
solely
an
equal
protection
case
out
of
this
court,
that
the
court
was
considering
that
case
and
therefore,
under
the
more
general
rule
that
raised
and
decided
that
the
california
supreme
court
in
1984
had
attempted
to
decide
both
federal
constitutional
issues.
however,
as
the
court
knows,
we
have
also
raised
the
jurisdictional
issue
of
finality,
that
this
court
lacks
jurisdiction
because
in
1984
the
appellant
should
have
proceeded
to
seek
review
in
this
court
at
that
time
since
all
federal
constitutional
issues
had
been
raised.
with
respect
to--
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
--no,
not
exactly
in
those
words,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
the
point
of
the
finality
rule,
which
is
to
protect
federalism
and
also
to
have
efficiency
within
the
court
system,
would
be
served
in
this
type
of
case
where
the
federal
constitutional
issues
have
been
decided
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
california
so
that
on
any
remand
of
state
issues
only,
the
lower
courts
are
going
to
be
judged
by
what
the
california
supreme
court
has
said
is
the
appropriate
federal
constitutional
application.
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
there
was
a
remand--
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
--well,
right,
but--
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
--that's--
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
--that's
possibly
true.
there's
no
question
that
could
have
happened.
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
state
law
issue.
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
but
the--
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
--but
the
federal
issue
was
certainly
a
basic
underpinning
of
what
the
trial
court
was
going
to
have
to
do
in
that
case
with
respect
to
the
construction
of
the
statute,
and
i
think
another
aspect
of
this
case
that
may
differ
from
other
types
of
cases
where
folks
are
asking
a
construction
of
the
finality
rule,
this
court
has
recognized
that
in
child
custody
cases
time
is
of
the
essence,
that
it
impacts
a
child's
development
to
delay,
and
i
think
one
could
say
this
case
is
a
classic
example.
it
has
been
in
the
court
system
now
seven
and
one
half
years,
or
almost
seven
and
one
half
years.
if
it
would
have
had
to
come
to
this
court
four
years
ago,
there
would
have
been
four
years
less
anxiety
on
the
part
of
the
adoptive
parents,
anxiety
on
the
part
of
the
adopted
child,
katie.
so
in
this
kind
of
case
there
may
be
some
benefit
to
having
a
finality
rule
in
custody,
child
custody
cases.
with
respect
to
the--
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
only
if
the
highest
court
in
the
state
has
ruled
on
a
federal
constitutional
issue
properly
raised.
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
with
respect
to
the
substantive
issue,
as
we
characterize
it,
the
central
substantive
issue
is
whether
the
constitution
requires
a
state
to
give
the
same
consensual
rights
to
the
father,
to
the
unwed
father
as
it
gives
to
the
unwed
mother
of
a
newborn
child.
in
this
case
we
have
katie
moses
who
was
born
july
18,
1981.
three
days
later
she
was
placed
with
the
county
adoptions
agency
at
the
request
of
her
mother.
approximately
three
weeks
after
her
birth,
her
mother
signed
a
formal
relinquishment
of
the
child
to
the
county
adoptions
agency
for
adoption.
and
approximately
five
weeks
after
her
birth,
she
was
placed
in
the
adoptive
family.
she
has
resided
with
that
adoptive
family
since
that
time.
there
has
been
no
interruption
in
that
placement.
the
requirement
for
the
consent
of
only
the
mother
of
an
unwed
newborn
is
designed
to
implement
the
state
policy
which
is
the
speedy
placement
of
children,
to
put
them
into
a
stable
setting
so
they
can
nurture
and
nourish.
the
reason
that
the
limiting
the
consent
to
the
mother
is
reflected
in
both
the
enormity
of
the
problem.
in
1986
in
california
one-quarter
of
all
births
were
to
unwed
mothers.
and
as
this
court
recognized
in
the
lehr
case,
that
mothers...
excuse
me,
unwed
fathers
are
typically
not
as
identifiable
and
not
as
necessarily
not
as
interested
in
fatherhood.
so--
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
--that
is
right
once
the
child
is
going
to
be
placed
in
adoption.
this
proceeding
arises
as
a
part
of
the
adoption
process,
and
that's
how
the
notice
is
required.
as
this
court
knows,
as
a
result
of
stanley,
there's
a
lot
of
gnashing
as
to
what
procedures
should
the
states
implement
in
order
to
meet
those
procedural
due
process
requirements.
the
california
law
is
basically
the
uniform
parentage
act.
so
at
a
point
in
time,
yes,
the
father
is
given
notice.
it
gives
the
father
an
opportunity
to
come
in
and
claim
custody,
and
he's
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
the
best
interests
standard,
or
he
can
simply
ignore
it,
and
a
default
is
entered.
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
that
hearing
is
required
through...
is
implementing
stanley
v.
illinois.
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
the
value
is
it
does
give
the
unwed
father
an
opportunity
to
come
in
and
seek
custody.
first
the
unwed
father
establishes
the
parentage,
and
then
under
the
statute,
as
it
existed
at
the
time
of
this
proceeding,
the
father,
if
he
claims
custodial
rights,
has
a
hearing
on
that
issue.
and
in
the
first
trial
the
trial
court
used
the
best
interests
of
the
child
standard,
and
based
on
that
standard,
denied
his
request,
awarded
the
custody
to
the
moses
family.
that
went
up
on
the
appeal.
the
california
supreme
court
concluded
that
it
was
a
detriment/best
interests
test
that
should
have
been
applied.
it
came
back
to
the
trial
court
in
1985.
there
was
a
hearing.
based
on
the
evidence
provided
at
that
hearing,
the
court
concluded
it
would
be
detrimental
to
the
child
to
be
returned
to
her
father
or
placed
with
her
father,
and
it
was
in
the
best
interests
that
she
remain
with
the
moses.
so
that's
the
statutory
scheme
with
respect
to
the
7017
proceeding
that
is
here.
now,
california,
though,
does
make
it
possible
for
the
unwed
father
to
grasp
the
opportunity
for
fatherhood,
and
that
is
found
in
civil
code
section
7006(c).
it
allows
a
father
to
file
a
filiation
proceeding
where
the
father
can
establish
the
parent-child
relationship,
where
the
court
can
award
custody,
can
award
visitation,
can
order
the
father
to
pay
support,
and
at
the
same
time,
when
this
action
was
filed
in
1982,
when
the
trof
action
was
filed
in
1982,
the
mere
filing
of
the
7006(c)
action
would
have
stayed
the
termination
proceeding.
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
well,
justice
o'connor,
from
our
view,
the
father
did
not
do
all
he
could
have
done,
and
in
fact,
he
did
not
do
anything.
just
to
recite
the
facts,
he
learned
about
the
birth
on
august
1,
1982.
he
first
met
with
the
social
worker
on
august
5.
he
did
not
want
custody
at
that
time.
he
met
with
her
again
on
august
10;
he
did
not
want
custody
at
that
time.
he
met
with
her
on
august
17,
and
that
was
the
first
time
that
he
raised
the
issue
of
custody.
he
then
did
not
meet
with
the
social
worker
until
november
11
where
he
saw
the
child
the
second
time.
so
during
that
whole
period,
there
was
still
no
contact
from
the
father
with
respect
to
his
child.
so
i
think
there
is
a
question,
did
he
do
everything
he
could
have
done
in
order
to
have
established
or
perfected
his
rights.
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
the
trial
court
certainly
did
not
find
that
he
could
have
done
all
that
he
could
have
done.
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
if
he
had,
if
he
had
established
that
it
was
in,
would
have
been
in
the
best
interests
to
have
the
child
placed
with
him--
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
the
issue
would
not
have
been
any
different.
however,
it
would
have
been
an
affirmative
action
on
his
part
in
order
to
perfect
his
rights,
and
that
i
think
is
a
significant
factor
in
the
opportunity
that
the
california
statute--
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
--well,
for
one
thing,
a
timely
filing
of
that
kind
of
action
could
have
prevented
some
of
the
bonding
issues
that
have
arisen
in
this
case.
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
he
could
have
asked
for
interim
custody.
he
could
have--
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
--under
our
view--
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
--the
county
agency's
perspective
is
that
the
child
is
better
off
wherever
it
is
in
the
best
interests
of
the
child
to
be.
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
well,
yes,
but
by
the
time
we
were
making
that
judgment
in
court,
the
child
had
been
with
the
parents
for
some
four
months.
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
well,
in
all
candor
i
can't
say.
my
feeling
is,
my
sense
of
it
is
the
issue
would
have
been
what
is
best
for
the
child?
does
this
man
have
a
serious
interest
in
raising
this
child?
has
he
come
forth
with
a
plan
that
warrants
serious
consideration?
if
so,
that
might
well
have
been
in
the
best
interests
of
the
child
at
a
particular
time.
but
we
will
never
know
because
that
avenue
was
not
pursued.
so
what
has
happened
is
this
case
has
been
in
litigation
for
some
seven
years
now,
and
we
have
a
child
that
has
been
in
this
placement
for
seven
years
now,
and
from
the
country's
perspective,
there's
a
lot
of
inaction
on
his
part
to
have
created
this
problem.
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
certainly.
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
that
would
have
been
an
alternative,
certainly.
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
his
different...
excuse
me.
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
his
different
status
could
have
arisen
from
filing
the
filiation
proceeding,
having
obtained
some
custodial
interest
in
the
child
through
visitation
or
otherwise,
he
would
have
become
a
presumed
father.
that
would
have
put
him
into
a
class
of
father
where
his
consent
would
have
been
necessary
in
order
for
the
adoption
to
take
place.
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
you
can
become
one,
yes.
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
no,
no
limit.
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
he
would,
by...
he
would
become
a
presumed
father
by
having
married
the--
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
--not,
no,
no,
he
would
not
have
become
a
presumed
father
by
offering
to
marry.
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
or
merely
filing
the
filiation.
the
presumed
father
status
is
akin
to
what
we
used
to
call
legitimation,
and
one
of
the
concepts
in
that
is
you
can
bring
your
illegitimate
child
into
your
home,
hold
that
child
out
as
your
own,
and
that
legitimated
the
child.
that
was
the
law
in
california
before
the
uniform
parentage
act.
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
no,
it
was
not
open
to
him.
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
only
if
he
would
have
gotten
the
custody,
but
it
would
have--
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
--no,
just,
no.
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
on
these
facts,
no,
no.
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
the
argument
that
we've
made
is
that
the
policies
of
california
established
by
the
gender
distinction
that's
made
in
7017(d)
are
consistent
with
the
test
of
this
court
dealing
with
gender
distinctions.
justice
powell's
opinion
in
the
caban
case
recognized
that
"in
those
cases
where
the
father
never
has
come
forward
to
participate
in
the
rearing
of
his
child,
nothing
in
the
equal
protection
clause
precludes
the
state
from
withholding
from
him
the
privilege
of
vetoing
the
adoption
of
that
child.
"
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
in
caban,
the
father
had
actually
had
custody
of
the
child.
that
dealt
with
an
older
child
where
there
had
been
two
sets
of
married
folks
competing.
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
right.
this
case
is
similar,
we
think,
to
lehr
and
parham
because
in
lehr
this
court
said
it
was
not
a
denial
of
equal
protection
or
due
process
where
the
father
had
sailed
to
send
in
the
postcard
that
would
have
put
him
on
the
putative
fathers
registry
so
that
he
would
have
received
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
appear
at
the
adoption
of
his
child.
and
this
was
held,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
father
was
also
pursuing
a
separate
court
action
to
attempt
to
claim
custody
of
the
child.
in
parham,
that's
where
the
court
held
that
it
was
not
a
denial
of
equal
protection
to
preclude
the
unwed
father
of
an
illegitimate
child
from
maintaining
a
wrongful
death
action
if
the
father
had
not
taken
the
necessary
steps
under
georgia
law
to
legitimate
the
child.
and
what
we're...
what
we're
suggesting
here
is
that
like
parham
and
like
lehr,
mr.
mcnamara
did
have
an
opportunity
through
the
use
of
7006(c)
to
put
himself
in
the
type
of
position
where
he
could
have
been
a
presumed
father.
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
no,
no,
what
i
was
saying
to
justice
stevens
was
that
merely
filing
the
action
itself
would
not
have
put
him
in
the
presumed
father
status.
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
by
getting
custody,
some
type
of
custody
of
the
child.
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
the
filiation
proceeding
would
have
been
an
available
resource
to
him,
mr.
chief
justice.
he
just
did
not--
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
--the
right
to
obtain
custody
of
the
child
or
visitation
with
the
child.
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
well,
no,
they
might
have...
the
point
is
they
might
have
applied
the
same
tests,
they
would
have
applied
the
best
interests,
but
when
you're
dealing
with
the
child
custody
timing
is
all
important,
and
i
think
that's
what
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
recognized,
that
it
is
that
substantial
relationship
between
parent
and
child
that
warrants
the
protection
and
if
a
father
is
going
to
sleep
on
his
rights,
such
as
not
send
the
postcard
in,
take
those
steps
that
are
possibly
available
to
fasten
some
relationship
between
him
and
the
child,
at
least
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
that
father
is
not
going
to
be
denied
equal
protection.
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
certainly.
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
that
is
what
the
case
is
about,
that's
true.
and
in
that
respect,
looking
at
the
test
used
by
this
court
in
craig
v.
boren,
where
the
classification
serves
an
important
governmental
objective,
which
in
this
case
would
be
speedy
and
stable
placements
of
newborn
children,
we
believe
the
classification
is
substantially
related
to
that
point.
and
if
i
might
just
quote
from
justice
stevens
in
the
caban
case,
the
reasons
for
the
substantial
relationship,
only
the
other
carries
the
child.
it
is
she
who
has
the
constitutional
right
to
decide
whether
to
bear
it
or
not.
these
differences
continue
at
birth
and
immediately
thereafter.
during
that
period,
the
mother
and
child
are
together,
the
mother's
identity
is
known
with
certainty.
the
father,
on
the
other
hand,
may
or
may
not
be
present.
these
natural
differences
between
unmarried
fathers
and
mothers
make
it
probable
that
the
mother
and
not
the
father
or
both
parents
will
have
custody
of
the
newborn
infant.
and
that's
the
way
it
was
in
this
case.
justice
stevens
continued,
but
as
a
matter
of
equal
protection
analysis,
it
is
perfectly
obvious
that
at
the
time
and
immediately
after
a
child
is
born
out
of
wedlock,
differences
between
men
and
women
justify
some
differential
treatment
of
the
mother
and
father
in
the
adoption
process.
most
particularly,
these
differences
justify
a
rule
that
gives
the
mother
of
the
newborn
infant
the
exclusive
right
to
consent
to
its
adoption.
in
lehr,
this
court
made
the...
states
the
same
rule,
equal
protection
does
not
prevent
a
state
from
according
the
two
parents
different
legal
rights
if
a
parent
has
never
established
a
custodial,
personal
or
financial
relationship
with
a
child.
the
fundamental
point
we're
making
is
that
biology
in
and
of
itself
does
not
create
any
substantial
relationship
or
create
a
protected
relationship.
there
must
be
something
substantial
between
the
father
and
the
child.
absent
that,
the
classification
is
reasonable.
and
it
is
on
this
point
that
i
think
the
appellant
misconceives
the
role
of
this
court.
this
court
is
not
to
sit
as
an
intermediate
state
appellate
court
to
review
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
supporting
the
determination
of
the
trial
court
as
to
who
should
have
custody
of
the
child.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
the
unwed
father
classification
meets
constitutional
principles.
we
submit
that
it
does.
i'd
like
to
make
a
point
with
respect
to
what
is
the
remedy
that
the
appellant
seeks
in
this
case,
because
quite
frankly,
he
has
never
made
it
clear.
on
page
3
of
his
reply
brief,
he
says
that
it
is
the
termination
of
rights
of
the
father
proceeding
is
set
aside,
no
adoption
will
be
permissible
without
his
consent,
and
he
will
be
able
to
seek
custody,
visitation,
pay
support
and
be
a
full
participant
in
katie's
life.
on
the
other
hand,
on
page
4
he
states
it
is
not
likely
that
edward
will
get
custody,
and
why
is
that?
in
all
candor,
i
think
it's
for
the
same
reasons
that
he
did
not
get
custody
in
the
trial
court:
the
best
interests
of
the
child
are
such
that
custody
should
remain
with
the
moses.
so
if
we
are
down
to
the
point
where
visitation
is
the
only
remedy
that
he
is
seeking,
that
again
is
subject
to
the
requirements
of
section
4600
of
the
civil
code,
which
is
the
detriment/best
interests
of
the
child
standard.
so
even
that
type
of
action
by
the
father
is
subject
to
the
same
statutory
standard
that
this
termination
proceeding
was
subject
to.
with
respect
to
the
substantive
due
process
argument,
again,
mcnamara
ignores
the
fact
that
he
did
have
an
opportunity
to
establish
a
relationship
with
his
child
under
state
law.
we
again
refer
to
7006(c)
of
the
civil
code.
mr.
lloyd
harmon,
jr.
yes,
that
is
in
the
brief.
but
in
any
event,
this
is
not
an
intrusion
into
an
existing
family
unit.
mr.
mcnamara
and
his
daughter
were
never
a
family.
they
never
had
any
relationship.
as
counsel
indicated,
the
most
they
saw
of
each
other
may
have
been
an
hour
and
one
half
some
seven
years
ago.
so
we
would
submit
that
under
the
tests
that
this
court
has
applied
in
stanley,
caban,
that
before
a
personal
liberty
interest
occurs,
there
must
be
a
substantial
relationship
between
the
father
and
the
child.
absent
that,
there
is
no
protected
liberty
interest.
thank
you.
