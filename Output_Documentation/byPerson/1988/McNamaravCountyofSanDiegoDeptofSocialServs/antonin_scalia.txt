justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
the
words
were
used
in
describing
stanley?
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
not
applying
them
to
your
own
factual
situation,
saying
we
claim
that
in
this
case
there
has
been
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
you
just
described
stanley
as
having
spoken
about
equal
protection.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
you
tell
me
where
the
california
supreme
court
discusses
this
issue
of
equal
protection?
i
must
say
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
in
your
jurisdictional
statement
somewhere?
justice
antonin
scalia
where...
i'm
looking
for
the
word
"equal
protection".
i
just
don't
really
find
it
very
quickly.
do
you
want
to
tell
me
the
first
time
you
see
the
word
"equal
protection"?
just
say
bingo
or
something.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they
also
don't
seem
to
be
talking
about
equal
protection.
it's
not
just
that
they
are
not
using
the
magic
word
i
don't...
i
must
say,
it's
a
very
subtle
discussion
of
the
issue
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
why
it
was
a
necessary
part
of
the...
it
certainly
wasn't
a
necessary
part
of
the
judgment
if
you
never
raised
the
point.
i
mean,
at
most
you
can
argue
they
happened
to
address
the
point,
but
it
wasn't
necessary
for
them
to
address
it
if
you
had
never
raised
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
sutherland,
most
states
that
i'm
aware
of,
all
that
i'm
aware
of,
have
laws
against
polygamy.
i
guess,
i
guess
that
they
wouldn't
make
a
whole
lot
of
difference
if
you
wanted
to
have
a
lot
of
children
by
different
women,
you
just
would
not
marry
the
women
and
become
the
biological
father
of
children
by
a
number
of
different
women,
and
you
are
telling
us
you
would
have
some
legal
rights
to
be
declared
the
father
of
all
of
those
children.
justice
antonin
scalia
mm-hmm.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
those
polygamy
laws
are
really
sort
of
dead
letters,
really.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
have.
they
have
antipolygamy
laws.
i
think
what
that
means
to
say
is
you
can
be
the
father
of
as
many
children
as
you
beget
in
a
legally
constituted
marriage.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that's
the
purpose
of
those
laws.
i
think
that
means
you
cannot
beget
as
many
children
as
you
like
by
as
many
women
as
you
like
and
be
their
father.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
purpose
of
the
quotation
is
to
set
the
stage
for
the
last
paragraph
of
the
footnote,
which
simply
concludes:
because
we
have
ruled
that
the
new
york
statute
is
unconstitutional
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
we
similarly
express
no
view
as
to
whether
a
state
is
constitutionally
barred...
it's
not
a
substantive
discussion
of
equal
protection
at
all.
the
point
of
it,
if
you
go
back
to
the
text
to
see
what
the
footnote
is
for,
is
to
establish,
is
to
establish
that
caban,
like
stanley,
involved
biological
fathers
who
had
established
strong
ties
and
held
them
out
as
their
own.
that's
the
only
purpose
it's
cited
for.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
argument
still
does,
even
if
you
limit
it
to
that
narrow
category
of
cases,
it
does
hinge
upon
what
the
chief
justice
suggested,
that
is,
that
if
we
might
have
taken
it,
you
must
apply
to
us.
if
we
make
an
exception
from
our
normal
finality
rules
ever,
you
have
to
take
a
shot
at
getting
us
hear
it,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
in
all
custody
cases,
even
though
you
might
win
on
remand,
you
have
to
go
through
the
expense
of
filing
cert
petitions
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
suppose
he
didn't,
marry
the
woman.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
which
is
what
the
state
would
have
preferred.
i
was
looking
through
the
statutes
here.
wouldn't
he
have
occupied
a
different
status
if
he,
not
only
if
he
had
married
her,
but
if
he
had
offered
or
sought
to
marry
her?
