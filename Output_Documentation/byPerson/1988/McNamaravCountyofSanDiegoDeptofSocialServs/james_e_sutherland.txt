mr.
james
e.
sutherland
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
a
case
involving
the
complete
and
irrevocable
termination
of
an
unwed
father's
parental
rights
to
associate
with
his
natural
child
as
contrasted
to
a
custody
or
even
a
visitation
dispute
which
would
be
the
province
of
the
state
domestic
relations
courts
and
would
have
to
be
handled
there
if
mr.
mcnamara
prevails.
this
appeal
presents
equal
protection
claims
by
the
father
who
was
deprived
of
that
most
precious
of
fundamental
rights,
the
right
to
be
a
parent
and
to
raise
and
care
for
his
biological
child,
and
results
in
the
loss
of
any
chance
of
a
lifelong
father-daughter
relationship.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
the
claim--
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
--the
claim
in
the
trial
court
was
that
he
was
entitled
to
the
parental
preference
under
the
california
statutes,
relying
on
stanley
v.
illinois,
both
establishing
the
fundamental
right,
and
both
due
process
and
equal
protection
claims.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
they
were
pressed
there
by
raising
that
particular
argument
in
the
trial
court
and
on
appeal.
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
not
cited.
the
california
supreme
court,
however,
when
it
took
over
the
case,
did
address
all
fourteenth
amendment
issues,
equal
protection.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
equal
protection
and
due
process.
it
is
in
the
opinion
in
the
jurisdictional
statement.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
well,
we
submit
that
we
raised
the
issue
but
not
as
directly
or
precisely
as
it
might
well
have
been.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
yes,
in
the
brief,
in
appellant's
opening
brief
and
in
discussing
the
stanley
v.
illinois
case,
the
appellant,
the
father,
did
mention
both
due
process--
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
--that
would
be
before
the
court
of
appeal.
the
brief
was...
the
way
the
procedure
works,
the
california
supreme
court
acted
on
the
same
briefs.
they
just
took
the
case
over
and
went
there.
as
i
recall,
the
words
were
used
also
in
the
trial
briefs
in
the
superior
court.
we
rely
primarily
here
on
the
jurisdiction
claim
on
the
passed
upon,
under
the
pressed
or
passed
upon
test.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
as
establishing
the
fundamental
right
that
he
was
trying
to
rely
upon
to
parent,
yes.
that's--
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
both--
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
--that's
correct.
that's
the
way
we
submit
the
pressed
or
passed
upon
test
express
in
clark
v.
jeter
and
other
cases
should
be
interpreted,
and
certainly
the
california
supreme
court,
when
it
interpreted
the
statute,
parental
rights
termination
statute
under
which
this
case
had
been
handled,
examined
all
the
cases,
stanley
and
caban,
lehr
v.
robertson
and
quilloin
and
said
that
the
california
statute,
as
interpreted,
granting
a
parental
preference
was
constitutional
under
those
cases,
particularly
because
this
court
had
not
interpreted
a
similar
statute
and
said
otherwise,
had
not
ruled
such
a
statute
unconstitutional.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
yes,
though
we
do--
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
--we
do
contend
that
the
substantial
rights
affected
are
to
be
considered
in
determining
the
equal
rights
standards
and
the
classification,
san
antonio
school
district,
griswald
v.
connecticut
and
other
cases
like
that,
so
that
the
substantive
right
involved
is
a
factor.
substantive
due
process,
we
would
submit,
would
be
more
clearly
presented
if,
for
instance,
the
statute
were
rewritten
so
that
both
mothers
and
all
fathers
could
lose
parental
rights
based
upon
the
best
interests
of
the
child
test,
then
we
would
invoke
the
reservations
in
santosky
v.
kramer
and
caban
and
go
to
the
substantial
due
process.
but
as
the
statutes
are
now
framed
and
applied,
it
is
these
unwed
fathers
in
mr.
mcnamara's
situation
who
are
denied
the
similar
rights
of
mothers
and
other
fathers
classified
as
presumed
fathers.
so
this--
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
it
starts
at
45a--
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
--first
time,
the
only
time
that
they
have
written
an
opinion
in
the
california
supreme
court.
the
second
appeal
was
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
well,
i
guess
i
haven't
underlined
or
outlined
that
particular
part
of
it.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
they
talk
in
footnote
8
on
page
45a
of
the
caban
case
and
the
undifferentiated
distinctions
which
were
not
permissible.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
thank
you.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
well,
may
i
proceed
without
taking
the
court's
time
to--
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
--all
right.
so
the
situation
presented
is
that
mr.
mcnamara
was
deprived
permanently
of
all
right
to
have
contact
with
his
daughter,
even
though
he
was
found
in
the
california
courts
to
have
done
everything
that
he
could,
everything
that
was
necessary
to
assert
and
protect
his
rights,
and
even
though
he
was
found
to
be
a
good
and
loving
father.
the
facts
of
the
situation
are
that
he
had
a
relationship
with
the
mother
in
the
fall
of
1980.
when
they
split
up
he
was
not
aware
of
the
pregnancy,
nor
was
she.
he
did
not
learn
of
it
until
about
two
weeks
after
the
child
was
born,
when
the
mother
asked
his
permission
or
his
consent
to
the
adoption.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
july
18,
1981.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
that's
correct,
hadn't
seen
her,
nor
had
he
had
any
contact
from
her.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
well,
i
think
we
might
get
to
that
if
we...
if
he
performed
all
the
other
requirements
to
come
under
the
definitions
of
this
court
of
manifesting
significant
parental
interest,
and
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
the
opportunity.
it's
a
little
close
to
see
whether
it
is
one
night
or
five
nights,
you
know,
where
would
you
draw
the
line
as
to
duration--
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
--it
would
go
beyond
all
the
cases.
there
have
been
no
opportunities...
this
is
the
first
case
where
the
courts
have
considered
a
newborn.
in
all
the
other
cases
the
father
either
had
an
opportunity
to
establish
a
relationship
or
to
show
disinterest
in
establishing
a
relationship
with
the
child.
so
the
critical
question
here
is
what
can
he
do
or
what
does
he
have
to
do
as
to
a
newborn,
and
when
is
he
entitled
to
that
right?
california
again
found
that
he
did
what
was
available.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
to
return
to
the
california
supreme
court's
consideration
of
the
constitutional
equal
protection
issues
for
the
jurisdiction
point,
i
can
only
refer
to
the
statements
in
the
jurisdictional
statement,
the
opinion
recited
there,
point
out
again
that
the
california
supreme
court
did
discuss
caban
and
the
equal
protection
provisions
and
the
requirements
of
that
case.
the
court
did
not
cite
chapter--
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
--not
other...
in
that
opinion,
not
other
than
that
footnote
citing
the
words
and
the
case
and
the
general
discussion.
i
would
point
out,
however,
that
when
the
second
appeal
case,
the
court
of
appeal
invited
additional
argument
on
the
significance
of
the
involvement
of
state
action,
and
the
county
responded
that
all
constitutional
issues
concerning
that
and
the
need
for
a
finding
of
unfitness
to
terminate
the
parental
rights
had
been
squarely
presented
to
the
california
supreme
court;
the
california
court
of
appeal
agreed
that
the
constitutional
issues,
state
action
and
others
had
been
foreclosed.
that's
in
the
opinion
of
that
court,
and
we
are
in
the
situation
where
the
county
has
also
conceded
here
at
page
10
of
the
brief
for
appellee
that
those
issues
were
raised
and
considered.
so
we
would
submit
that,
though
it's
not
artfully
stated
with
chapter
and
verse,
that
it
was
a
necessary
part
of
the
judgment,
and
it
was
obvious
that
that's
what
they
were
intending
to
do
is
uphold
it
against
all
those
claims.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
it
wasn't
necessary
to
meet
the
points
raised.
it
is
perhaps
necessarily
included
in
their
broad
statement
that
the
statute
as
interpreted
passes
muster
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
this
court's
cases
applying
it
to
unwed
fathers'
illegitimate
children.
i
would
point
out
as
to
the
various
issues
before
the
court
that
mr.
mcnamara
was
easily
identified
and
established
as
the
father
of
the
child.
he
was
named
on
the
birth
certificate,
he
was
found,
he
claimed
paternity,
he
was
stipulated
to
be
the
father,
and
he
was
adjudged
the
father.
so
many
of
the
issues
that
might
come
up
in
other
cases
are
not
presented
here.
we
are
addressed
only
with
the
situation
where
the
father
was
known
and
identified,
the
mother
has
relinquished
for
adoption,
the
father
then
came
forward,
asked
to
be
the
full
parent,
offered
to
take
and
requested
full
parental
responsibility
and
was
denied
any
opportunity
to
form
a
relationship
with
the
child
and
was
denied
any
protected
liberty
interest
by
the
california
courts.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
that's
correct,
your
honor,
that
no
mother
would
lose
her
parental
rights
under
the
california
scheme
without
a
finding
either
of
unfitness,
neglect
or
abandonment
of
the
child.
the
classification
of
presumed
fathers
is
treated
the
same.
the
presumed
father
is
one
who
has
married
the
mother,
who
has
attempted
to
marry
the
mother
by
going
through
a
ceremony
which
might
be
void
or
voidable,
or
whom
the
mother
has
let
take
the
child
into
his
home,
and
he
receives
it
into
his
family
and
holds
it
out
as
his
own.
we
contend
that
as
against
both
mothers
and
the
presumed
fathers
under
the
statute,
that
mr.
mcnamara
has
a
protected
interest
under
this
court's
cases
and
is
entitled
to
equal
protection
with
both
of
them.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
in
this
situation,
yes,
where
she
is--
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
--under
these
circumstances,
yes.
we
do
not
contend
that
all
unwed
fathers
should
be
treated
like
all
unwed
mothers.
our
contention
is
that
once
they
cross
the
threshold,
once
they
act
like
a
father
and
manifest
a
significant
parental
interest,
then
they
are
entitled
to
the
same
protection.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
well,
the
short
answer
is
all
that
he
was
allowed.
he
had
two
visits,
one
when
the
child
was
approximately
a
month
old,
and
then
a
couple
of
months--
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
--thirty
to
45
minutes,
approximately.
that
was
the--
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
--about
the
same
time.
it
was
in
november
of
1981.
they
went
to
trial.
the
child
was
born
in
july,
and
it
went
to
trial
the
first
time
in
december.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
yes.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
by
the
state.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
the
county--
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
--well,
first
by
placing
it
with
a
foster
parent,
and
then
placing
it
with
prospective
adoptive
parents.
that
was
done
a
week
after
he
asked
for
custody.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
yes.
and
he
has
consistently
tried.
we
are
litigating
hard
all
the
way
up
here.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
no,
not
in
california,
not
anywhere
in
any
state,
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
yes.
there's
two
california
statutes.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
we
would
certainly
contend
so.
we
would
think
that
we
would
be
walking
into
an
amorphous
area
of
conflicting
psychiatric,
psychological
testimony,
conflicting
opinions,
and
even
sort
of
wandering
off
into
1984
and
brave
new
world
where
we
are
deciding
parental
rights,
and
this
basic,
fundamental
relationship
based
on
what
expert
might
have
as
conflicting
opinions.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
no,
your
honor...
well,
yes.
i
think
it...
i'll
answer
the
question.
i
think
that
this
court
has
gone
forward
in
lehr
v.
robertson,
synthesizing
the
prior
cases,
to
establish
pretty
definite
guidelines
which
are
subject
to
proof
and
subject
to
court
interpretation
as
to
when
you
acquire
this
protected
liberty
interest.
when
you
act
like
a
father,
to
use
the
language
of
the
case,
is
fairly
obvious.
it's
certainly
a
lot
more
obvious
than
conflicting
psychiatric
opinion,
trends
in
child
custody
determination
which
have
evolved
and
changed
consistently,
and
where
there's
a
tremendous
amount
of
conflicting
opinion
and
testimony
in
custody
cases.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
rights
and
responsibilities.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
yes.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
our
position
would
be
that
if
that
is
a
concern
of
the
state,
then
the
state
first
ought
to
address
it
in
legislation.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
well--
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
--well,
it
means
precisely,
i
thought,
your
honor,
that
you
couldn't
marry
them
and
be
wise
to
them,
but
paternity
litigation
is
rife
with
men
who
have
been
married,
had
children
by
another
woman
who
was
not
their
wife,
and
they
are
still
stuck
with
support,
they
still
could
be
good
parents.
if
mr.
mcnamara
had
been
married
at
this
time,
he
still
would
have
been
a
good
parent,
as
the
court
found
him
to
be.
he
could
have
provided
a
good
and
loving
home.
if
the
state
feels
that
that
is
some
particular
fact
situation
that
should
prevent
a
father
in
that
situation
from
establishing
a
parent-child
relationship
with
a
child
born
out
of
wedlock,
then
the
state
should
address
that
first,
and
it
could,
just
as
it
could
address
in
a
statute
various
other
situations,
incest
or
rape
or
various
other
matters
of
policy.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
they
haven't
precluded
them
or
made
some
finding
that
this
is
a
policy.
they
just
say
all
the
fathers--
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
--but
that...
yes,
but
that
applies
to
all
the
unwed
fathers
who
are
not
presumed
fathers.
they
are
not
cutting
off
all
unwed
fathers
because
presumed
fathers
would
get
the
different
protection
and
the
same
standard
as
the
mother.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
i
think
the
state
has
an
interest.
that
interest
would
have
been
satisfied
here
by
giving
custody
to
mr.
mcnamara,
and
the
interests
of
the
state
to--
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
--well,
not
sufficiently.
certainly
the
california
supreme
court
said
no.
the
trial
court
said
yes
to
that
question,
and
the
california
supreme
court
said
there
was
no
basis
in
the
record
for
terminating
his
parental
rights
and
interest
for
not...
no
reason
to
not
give
him
custody
under
that.
bonding
becomes
one
of
the
amorphous
problems
when
you
walk
in
to
a
best-interests-of-the-child
test
in
that
sort
of
litigation,
and
you
have
all
sorts
of
competing
ideas
and
theories.
you
have,
used
to
have
a
tender
years
presumption.
you
used
to
have
a
belief
that
all
children
should
be
in
two-parent
homes.
now
one
parent,
single
parents
are
allowed
to
adopt
children.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
but
they
haven't
chosen
within
the
best
interests
standard.
they
have
just
said
if
you
are
not
a
presumed
father,
then
we
wander
off,
and
we're
going
to
decide
in
some
trial
what's
best
for
the
child,
whether
it
should
be
placement
with
you
or
placement
with
somebody
else
that--
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
--but
it's
a
determination
of
state
policy
which
deprives
fathers
who
have
achieved
protected
liberty
interest
from
the
equal
protection
with
other
people
covered
by
state
laws.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
none
hold
otherwise,
but
if
we
must
look
to
the
particular
holdings
of
this
court
and
the
factual
situations
addressed
in
order
to
achieve
that
interest,
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
father
of
a
newborn
child
to
have
a
relationship
over
a
period
of
years
to
either
demonstrate
interest
or
disinterest.
and
so
the
state
policy,
we
submit,
denies
equal
protection.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
i
would
have
no
trouble
with
it.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
not
really
as
to
substantive
due
process
and
procedural
due
process--
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
--yes.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
yes,
that
would
be--
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
--well,
i'm
claiming
equal
protection--
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
--i'm
claiming
equal
protection
and
ending
up
arguing
that
substantive
due
process
denial
and
the
denial
of
equal
protection
in
a
situation
are
the
same.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
the
time
for
argument
if
i
might.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
thank
you,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court:
the
paradox
in
the
situation
under
california
law
is
that
to
get
a
hearing,
mr.
mcnamara
had
to
come
under
section
7017,
seek
to
establish
his
paternity
by
filing
a
7006
petition,
which
he
did.
that
argument
was
never
raised
below,
and
california
found
that
procedures
had
been
followed.
so
he
had
to
come
in,
seek
to
take
full
custody,
become
a
parent,
act
like
a
father,
take
full
responsibility,
and
yet,
he's
cut
out
by
that
statutory
scheme
and
treated
as
one
who
had
no
interest
in
his
child
at
all.
that
would
be
another
sort
of
natural
father.
what
we
are
asking
the
court
to
do
is
determine
that
mr.
mcnamara's
parental
rights
should
not
be
terminated
except
on
the
same
grounds
as
the
mother
or
the
presumed
father,
unfitness,
neglect
or
abandonment.
that
will
result
in
a
new
trial
to
see
if
those
grounds
may
be
established.
on
the
basis
of
this
record,
they
cannot
be
because
he
is
a
good
and
loving
father
and
always
has
been.
that
will
leave
custody
open.
custody
will
be
decided
by
the
california
courts
according
to
the
best
interests
of
the
child.
mr.
mcnamara
would
have
the
right
to
seek
custody,
perhaps
not
now
but
perhaps
sometime
in
the
future,
he
would
have
the
right
to
try
for
visitation,
he
would
have
the
right
to
establish
a
lifelong
relationship,
all
subject
to
the
trial
facts
and
the
supervision
of
the
california
courts.
the
main
points
raised
to
justify
the
disparate
treatment
are
supposed
effects
upon
adoptions
and
upon
unwed
mothers
in
certain
circumstances.
we
submit
that
that
is
speculative,
there
is
no
proof
offered
that
there
would
be
those
adverse
consequences.
it
doesn't
seem
to
bother
texas,
illinois
or
wisconsin
which
require
the
same
grounds.
it
doesn't
bother
the
commissioners
on
uniform
laws
and
the
uniform
parentage
act,
section
4
when
they
become
a
presumed
father
merely
by
filing
an
affidavit
of
paternity,
which
is
not
contested.
san
diego
county,
according
to
the
newspapers,
its
current
administration
under
these
circumstances
would
give
custody
to
the
father
subject
to
change,
but
it
does
indicate
that
all
these
adverse
consequences
don't
come
about.
it
doesn't
bother
california.
the
delay,
the
possible
placement
with
the
father
all
arise
now
because
the
statutory
scheme
requires
notice
and
a
hearing
so
that
the
father
might
get
custody.
it
didn't
bother
the
california
supreme
court
which
found
no
policy
reason,
no
factual
reason
nor
any
legal
reason
to
deny
parental
rights,
terminate
parental
rights
at
the
first
trial.
if
merely
placing
the
child
with
prospective
adoptive
parents
or
foster
parents
is
going
to
become
determinative
of
these
issues,
then
agencies
may
act
with
impunity
because
the
courts
will
take
time,
there
is
certainly
some
delay
even
pendente
lite
litigation.
this
trial
as
done
in
about
three
or
four
months,
which
is
pretty
fast,
but
there's
still
delay
that
they
complain
of.
so
that--
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
--no,
no,
was
within
three
or
four
months.
mr.
james
e.
sutherland
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
it
was
started,
a
petition
was
put
up
in
august
and
the
trial
went
in
december.
so
that
there
simply
is,
we
submit,
no
basis
for
the
differential.
no
important
state
interest
is
served,
certainly
no
compelling
state
interest
is
served.
again,
state
interest
is
to
find
a
good
home,
and
mr.
mcnamara
offered
one.
he
offered
one
well
within
the
time
the
state
thought
he
should
do
so.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
submit,
your
honor.
