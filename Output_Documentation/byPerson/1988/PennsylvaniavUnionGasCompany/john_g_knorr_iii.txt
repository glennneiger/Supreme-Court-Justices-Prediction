mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
a
private
party
may
sue
a
state
for
damages
in
federal
court
under
the
superfund
act.
now,
the
parties
have
briefed
and
the
case
could
present
constitutional
issues
regarding
the
eleventh
amendment
and
about
the
continuing
vitality
of
this
court's
decision
in
hans
v.
louisiana.
but
the
first
issue
is
the
statutory
question
of
whether
congress
intended
to
subject
states
to
these
kinds
of
actions,
and
if
the
court
agrees
that
congress
did
not,
then
there
is
no
need
to
reach
those
constitutional
issues.
when
the
court
of
appeals
first
looked
at
the
superfund
act,
it
found
that
the
statute
showed
no
evidence
of
a
congressional
intention
to
subject
states
to
private
liability.
they
found
that
the
statute
was
very
similar
to
that
construed
in
the
employees
of
missouri
case,
that
is,
states
were
literally
included
among
the
universe
of
possible
defendants,
but
there
was
not
the
specific
indicia
that
this
court
has
found
necessary
to
override
the
eleventh
amendment.
when
on
remand
from
this
court,
the
court
of
appeals
next
looked
at
the
statute,
they
looked
at
it
in
light
of
intervening
amendments
in
an
act
known
by
its
acronym
as
sara,
and
in
light
of
this
court's
decision
in
atascadero
that
to
affect
the
eleventh
amendment
congress
must
make
itself
clear,
must
express
itself
with
unmistakable
clarity
in
the
words
of
the
statute,
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
unmistakable
clarity
in
the
last
clause
of
an
exception
to
a
provision
that
excludes
state
and
local
governments
from
liability
under
certain
circumstances.
when
you
look
at
that
amendment--
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
--the
amendment
is
set
forth
on
pages
3
and
4
of
our
brief
on
the
merits.
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
the
amendment
is
codified
at
section
9601(20)(d),
and
when
you
look
at
it
as
a
whole,
it
is
apparent
that
it's
not
about
the
eleventh
amendment
at
all.
what
congress
was
focusing
on
here
was
the
very
different
and
very
narrow
question
of
what
do
you
do
about
a
unit
of
government
that
has
acquired
a
site
involuntarily,
because
under
superfund
as
it
was
originally
enacted,
there
is
strict
liability,
and
a
unit
of
government
could
well
find
itself
liable
under
those
circumstances.
when
the
sara
amending
act
was
going
through
the
senate,
the
senate
added
a
provision
that
would
exclude
government
liability
under
those
circumstances.
the
amendments
then
went
to
a
conference
committee,
and
in
the
conference
committee
an
exclusion
or
an
exception
to
that
exclusion
was
added
which
provided
that
even
if
a
site
was
acquired
involuntarily,
if
the
government
unit
then
did
something
to
cause
or
contribute
to
the
discharge
of
hazardous
materials,
there
would
then
still
be
liability,
and
it's
that
provision
that
the
court
of
appeals
fastened
upon
and
in
which
they
felt
congress
had,
with
unmistakable
clarity,
focused
on
the
eleventh
amendment.
there
is,
however,
no
explicit
mention
of
the
amendment
in
the
statute.
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
indicates
that
congress
was
even
thinking
about
the
eleventh
amendment
or
the
problems
of
government
immunity
in
general--
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
--i
think
in
light
of
atascadero,
it
would
certainly
be
prudent,
but
i
wouldn't
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
it
is
invariably
necessary
in
every
circumstance.
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
i
think
that
is
simply
the
kind
of
general
liability
language,
which
means
that
if
the
unit
of
government
doesn't
fit
within
the
first
sentence,
that
is,
the
exclusion
of
liability,
we
are
then
back
to
square
one
with
the
rest
of
the
statute,
and
whatever
would
otherwise
control
under
the
statute
controls.
i
think
if
you
look
even
in
isolation
at
that
last
clause
of
the
second
sentence,
the
clause
that
begins
"such
a
unit
of
government",
you
wouldn't
find...
what
you'd
find
are
the
following
characteristics.
you'd
find
no
mention
of
the
eleventh
amendment
or
of
state
immunity.
you
find
no
mention
of
state
liability
to
private
parties.
you
find
it
is
part
of
a
statute
which
does
explicitly
mention
federal
liability,
to
which
the
eleventh
amendment
is,
of
course,
no
bar.
and
you
find
that
even
this
narrow
clause
of
the
statute
incudes
local
governments
as
well
as
states.
now,
local
governments,
of
course,
don't
have
any
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
not
the
kind
of
language--
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
--by
a
private
party.
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
i
think
it
amounts
to
much
the
same
thing
in
the
case
of
the
states--
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
--well,
not
in
this
case.
in
this
case
congress
has
given
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
the
federal
courts.
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
in
other
cases
it
might
not.
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
that
is
true.
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
i
don't
know,
in
this
case
it
does
because--
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
--but
they
didn't,
they
didn't
do
anything--
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
--oh,
it
is.
states
are
liable
to
the
united
states,
and
under
this
kind
of
a
statute,
only
to
the
united
states.
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
well,
except
for
the
eleventh
amendment,
certainly.
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
there
is...
oh,
certainly
there
is
liability
here.
there
is
liability
to
the
federal
government,
but
because
of
the
fact
that
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
these
causes
of
action
is
within
the
federal
courts,
since
the
eleventh
amendment
is
a
bar
in
the
federal
courts,
i
don't
see
any
circumstances
where
a
state
could
be
held
liable
to
a
private
party.
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
exactly.
i
think
it
remains,
the
statute
remains
very--
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
--i
think
the
statute
is
very
similar
to
the
statute
that
was
construed
in
the
employees
of
missouri
case.
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
and
in
that
case
as
well
there
was
certainly
literal
inclusion
of
the
states
among
the
potential
defendants
but
there
was
not
the
explicit,
unmistakable
clarity
necessary,
that
this
court
has
found
to
be
necessary
to
make
sure
that
congress
has
specifically
and
expressly
focused
on
the
issue
of
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
that
this
kind
of
general
language,
imposing
liability
on
states,
among
others,
is
not
enough.
and
i
think
the
inclusion
of
local
governments
in
that
last
clause
is
very
telling.
i
think
that
it's
very
difficult
to
say
that
congress
was
focusing
on
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity
here.
otherwise
they
would
not...
this
is
not
what
congress
would
have
written
under
those
circumstances.
and
i
think
the
proof
of
that
is
to
look
at
what
congress
did
write
virtually,
virtually
the
same
day,
at
almost
the
identical
moment,
they
were
considering
amendments
to
the
rehabilitation
act
in
response
to
the
court's
atascadero
decision.
and
what
they
said
there
was
this.
a
state
shall
not
be
immune
under
the
eleventh
amendment
from
suit
in
federal
court
for
a
violation
of,
and
then
they
list
the
statutes.
that's
a
clear
statement
under
atascadero.
this
language
in
sara,
we
submit,
is
not
even
close
to
a
clear
statement.
as
i
said,
if
the
court
agrees,
there
is
no
need
to
go
any
further
in
this
case.
but
i
will
not
talk
about
the
constitutional
issues
that
we've
briefed.
union
gas
has
asked
the
court
to
re-examine
and
reverse
its...
or
overrule
its
decision
in
hans
v.
louisiana,
and
i
will
get
to
that
in
a
minute.
but
i'd
like
to
talk
first
about
the
somewhat
different
question
of
the
proper
relationship
between
congress's
powers
under
article
i
of
the
constitution
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
eleventh
amendment
on
the
other;
more
specifically
still,
whether
under
its
article
i
powers,
specifically
the
commerce
clause,
congress
may
unilaterally
abrogate
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity
that
a
state
would
otherwise
enjoy.
and
when
the
court
has
looked
at
this
issue
in
the
past
in
cases
such
as
the
parden
case,
it
has
employed
a
two-sided
or
two-step
inquiry:
first,
did
congress
intend
to
subject
the
states
to
liability;
and
second,
is
there
any
evidence
of
state
consent
to
suit
in
federal
court?
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
i'm
sorry,
justice
brennan?
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
no,
this
does
not.
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
under
that,
congress
may
undoubtedly
abrogate
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
but
in
the
article
i
context,
the
court
has
in
the
past
locked
for
some
evidence
of
consent
on
the
part
of
the
state.
now,
the
consent
can
be
constructive
rather
than
express.
congress
may
act
to
induce
consent,
and
congress
may
act
to
define
what
will
be
construed
as
consent,
but
consent
of
some
kind
there
has
to
be.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
remember
that
in
this
case
union
gas
apparently
concedes,
because
they
haven't
mentioned
the
issue
in
their
brief,
that
nothing
pennsylvania
did
or
is
alleged
to
have
done
can
be
construed
as
consent
to
federal
jurisdiction
here
because
everything
pennsylvania
is
alleged
to
have
done
they
did
before
the
passage
of
the
superfund
act.
union
gas
doesn't
rely
on
any
theory
of
consent.
their
theory
is
that
consent
is
unnecessary
and
irrelevant,
and
they
rely
to
support
that
argument
on
the
idea
that
a
unilateral
ability
to
abrogate
immunity
is
somehow
necessary
to
vindicate
congress's
article
i
powers.
but
this,
i
would
say,
is
exactly
the
concern
that
this
court
recognized
and
addressed
in
ex
parte
young.
these
kinds
of
supremacy
clause
concerns
are
exactly
what
the
court
recognized
and
tried
to
accommodate
in
young.
young
is
the
court's
effort
to
balance
and
accommodate
the
competing
interests
of
state
and
national
governments.
union
gas's
approach,
the
approach
they
advocate,
reconciles,
if
you
will,
those
competing
interests
by
simply
eliminating
the
legitimacy
of
the
state
side
of
that
balance.
it's
simply
a
principle
of
congressional
supremacy.
and
that,
we
submit,
is
not
the
proper
approach
for
this
kind
of
delicate
constitutional
problem.
they
rely
next,
as
we've
already
discussed
a
bit,
on
fitzpatrick
and
on
the
principle
that
under
its
fourteenth
amendment
powers
congress
may
abrogate
immunity.
but
what,
fitzpatrick
says
is
that
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
congress
may
do
what
is
constitutionally
impermissible
in
other
contexts.
fitzpatrick
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
the
exception
that
proves
the
rule.
what
they
really
seem
to
be
suggesting
here
is
that
fitzpatrick
was
wrongly
decided,
or
at
least
was
wrong
in
its
rationale.
but
if
you
put...
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
not
just
another
addition,
is
not
just
another
power
given
to
congress.
it's
not
just
another
limitation
on
what
states
may
do.
it
changes
the
very
nature
of
the
relationship
between
the
states
and
the
federal
government.
and
it
is
for
that
reason,
i
think,
that
the
court
felt
that
in
order
to
vindicate
that
power,
it
was
necessary
that
congress
be
able
to
abrogate
the
eleventh
amendment.
but
if
the
fourteenth
amendment
simply
stands
on
the
same
footing
as
article
i,
then
what
we
are
left
looking
for
is
some
general
principle
that
congress
may
set
aside
what
would
otherwise
be
constitutional
limitations
whenever
it
wants
to.
and
i
don't
know
of
any
support
for
that
principle.
we
believe
that
fitzpatrick
was
correctly
decided,
and
also,
that
the
analysis
in
parden
is
correct
and
ought
to
remain
a
part
of
the
court's
eleventh
amendment
analysis.
consent
of
some
kind
in
this
context
is
necessary,
and
consent
is
entirely,
and
i
believe
concededly
absent
in
this
case.
i'd
like
to
move
on
now,
if
i
may,
to
the...
to
the
last,
question
that
the
parties
have
presented.
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
the
way
it
ordinarily
works
is--
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
--no,
not
ordinarily.
ordinarily
the
superfund
act
is
a
strict
liability
statute,
and
no
one
need
do
anything
particularly
to
be
subject
to
liability.
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
oh,
in
that
case,
in
the
case
of
property
that
was
acquired
involuntarily--
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
--no,
it's
not.
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
i
believe
we
got
it
through
the
ordinary
eminent
domain
process.
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
it's
only...
it
is
not
premised
on
the
idea
that
we
acquired
the
property
involuntarily.
it's
premised
on
the
idea
that
the
last
clause
of
this
very
narrow
amendment
is
somehow
a
general
abrogation
of
eleventh
amendment
immunity
under
all
circumstances.
and
that's
why
i
said
that
this
is
part...
that
clause
is
part
of
a
very
narrow
provision
which
as
a
whole
was
intended
to
narrow,
not
to
expand
the
liability.
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
i
don't
know
if
there
were
any
cases,
but
it
would
have
been.
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
that
is
correct.
union
gas,
of
course,
has
asked
the
court
again
to
re-examine
its
decision
in
hans
and
to
overrule
it.
the
attack
comes
on
two
grounds.
hans,
first
of
all,
is
said
to
have
been
incorrectly
decided
as
a
matter
of
a
historical
event
or
a
historical
fact.
this
is
something
that
has
been
explored
in
great
detail
and
with
great
ability,
primarily
in
the
opinions
of
this
court
in
the
past,
and
i
don't
know
that
there
is
anything
for
me
to
add
to
the
detail
of
that
historical
argument.
i
will
say
only
that
we
submit
that
as
a
matter
of
history
there
is
ample
support
for
the
holding
in
hans,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
have
a
case
on
which
the
courts
and
the
congress
and
the
states
have
relied
for
a
century
now,
a
case
that
has
become
so
much
a
part
of
the
fabric
of
our
law
in
federal-state
relations,
you
need
to
do
more
to
undercut
it
than
simply
come
forward
with
pieces
of
historical
evidence
that
could
possibly
have
been
read
the
other
way.
in
a
manner
of
speaking,
i--
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
--well--
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
--i
think
they
have
relied
on
the
idea
that
they
cannot
simply
be
subjected
to
suit
in
federal
courts
unless
there
is
some
abrogation
of
that
immunity
by
congress.
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
that
would
be
very
difficult
to
prove.
i
don't
know
how
you
would
go
about
proving
such
a
thing.
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
well,
i
think
that
any
legal
act,
if
it
is
affected
by
a
legal
rule
that
has
been
around
for
a
century,
can
be
said
to
rely
on
it.
i
would
say
that
in
the
same
way
that--
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
--i
don't
know
what
there
would
be,
justice
kennedy,
in
the
way
of
specific.
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
i
might
speculate
it,
or
i
might
speculate
that
states
might
not
participate
in
a
variety
of
federal
programs
if
they
thought
that
they
would
be
liable
for
liability
actions.
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
i
might.
as
i...
i'm
not
here
to--
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
--i
don't
think
that
we
do,
but
i
think
that
we
do
know
that
it
has
been
a
part
of
our
law
for
an
awfully
long
time,
and
that
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
hans...
it
there
is
any
doubt,
hans
should
receive
the
benefit
of
that
doubt.
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
i
think
we
should
presume
that
the
states
try,
at
least,
to
behave
in
a
responsible
manner.
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
they
certainly...
i
would
assume
that
they
would
be.
they
certainly
could
be.
it's
not
at
all
the
case
that
states
are
getting
a
free
ride
under
this
statute.
it's
perhaps
relevant
here
to
point
out
that
there
is
not
only
the
question
of
liability
if
we're
sued
by
the
federal
government,
but
as
a
programmatic
matter
under
the
statute,
we
are
required
to
pick
up
10
percent
of
the
costs
of
the
federal
government
in
all
of
the
clean-up
activities
that
the
federal
government
undertakes
in
our
state.
that's
something
that
we
have
to
agree
to
do
as
a
condition
of
any
federal
clean-up.
so
it
certainly
isn't
the
case
that
we're
free
just
simply
to
ignore
the
problem.
the
only
final
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
hans
is
also
attacked
on
the
grounds
that
it
is
somehow
a
harmful
decision,
that
it's
a
pernicious
influence
in
our
law.
i
think
that
that
is
very
far
from
being
the
case.
i
think
that
we've
always
felt
in
this
country
that
one
of
the
ways,
and
maybe
the
primary
way,
that
you
protect
a
free
society
is
to
diffuse
governmental
power
among
as
many
pieces
of
the
government
as
you
can,
and
i
think
that
hans,
in
its
way,
is
a
part
of
that
structure.
it's
a
way
of
preserving
to
some
degree
the
independence
of
the
states
from
the
federal
government.
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
it
would
be
section
9607
of
the
act,
which
provides
that
any...
and
these
are
all
terms
of
art...
any
owner
or
operator
of
a
facility
from
which
there
is
a
discharge
of
hazardous
material
is
strictly
liable
for
the
clean-up
costs.
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
yes.
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
the
private
party
would
get
the
authority
from
the--
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
--or
local
government
operator.
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
it
might
but
for
the
way
this
court
has
construed
similar
statutes
and
employees
and
but
for
this
court's
atascadero
decision.
i
think
that
there
is
a
plausible
alternative
explanation
which
is--
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
--that's
where
it
would
lead
you,
but
you
are
then
left
back
with
the
fact
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
original
statute
that
justifies
that
reading.
that's
where
you...
that's
where
that
leads
you.
as
i
was
saying,
i
think
that
hans
does
play
its
part
in
keeping,
preserving
the
diffusion
of
government
power,
and
i
believe
that
it
should
be
allowed
to
continue
to
play
that
part.
and
unless
any
further
questions
arise
from
the
court,
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
i
can
perhaps
fill
in
a
gap
of
pennsylvania
law
here.
pennsylvania
has
enacted
a
very
limited
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
in
its
state
courts,
but
as
part
of
that
same
statute,
expressly
preserved
its
eleventh
amendment
immunity
from
suit
in
the
federal
courts.
that
statute
is
in
our
reply
brief,
but
it's
codified
at
42
pa
consolidated
statute,
section
8521.
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
well,
if
congress
had
not
given
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
the
federal--
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
--courts,
i
think
the
federal
cause
of
action
could
very
likely
have
been
brought
in
state
courts.
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
well,
as
to
our
own
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
i'm
not
certain.
one
of
the
areas
where
immunity
is
waived
is
in
the
damages
caused
by
what's
called
a
dangerous
condition
of
real
property.
i
don't
know
for
certain,
but
i
think
it's
conceivable
that
that
exception
might
cover
this.
mr.
john
g.
knorr,
iii
no,
not
to
my
knowledge.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
that's
all
i
have.
