unknown
speaker
where
is
that
set
forth
either
in
the
briefs
or
in
the
petition?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
so
do
you
think
unmistakable
clarity
means
explicit
reference
to
the
eleventh
amendment?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
effect
do
you
give
to
the
second
sentence
of
subparagraph
(d)
if
it
is
not
to
impose
liability?
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
the
immunity
to
or
from?
it's
from
being
sued
in
federal
court,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
is
it
not,
it's
not
immunity
from
liability.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
is
that?
i
mean,
if
you're
liable
under
a
federal
statute,
if
you
can't
sue
in
federal
court,
you
could
sue
someplace
else.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
in
this
case
it's
the
same
thing.
unknown
speaker
but
normally
liability
and
jurisdiction
really
don't
go
hand
in
hand.
unknown
speaker
and,
of
course
i
suppose
it
hurts
you
that
it
doesn't
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
congress
knew
that
and
said
the
states
are
really
liable,
and
therefore,
federal
courts
have
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
didn't
expect
their
liability
provision
to
be
empty.
don't
you
think
it
was
supposed
to
be
recoverable
somewhere?
unknown
speaker
well,
except
for
the
eleventh
amendment,
do
you
suppose
that
they
could
be
sued
by
a
private
party
and
rightfully
claim
liability?
unknown
speaker
so
you
agree
that
the
states
were
made
liable.
unknown
speaker
so
you're
really
saying
that
the
provision
in
sara
for
state
liability
should
be
construed
as
not
providing
for
liability
to
private
parties.
unknown
speaker
even
though,
even
though
on
its
face
it
would
seem
to
apply
to
private
parties
as
well
as
to
the
federal
government?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--this
argument,
i
gather,
doesn't
relate
at
all
to
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
under
that,
congress
could
abrogate
the
eleventh
amendment.
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
that
the
only
basis
for
liability
of
the
state
is
if
the
state
did
something?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
what
the
statute
says,
isn't
it,
that
the
state
has
to
do
something
to
contribute
to
the
release
of
whatever
it
is
that
shouldn't
be
released?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
the
exclusion
provided
under
this
paragraph
shall
not
apply
to
any
state
or
local
government
which
has
caused
or
contributed
to
the
release
or
threatened
release
of
the
hazardous
substance.
unknown
speaker
exactly,
which
is
this
case,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
the
state,
how
did
they
get
it?
unknown
speaker
and
is
state
liability
premised,
though,
on
this
provision?
it
is
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
before
this
was
passed,
was
a
state
ever
liable
to
the
united
states
in
a
voluntary
situation?
unknown
speaker
but
a
private
party
couldn't...
could
never
have
sued
a
state
because
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
unknown
speaker
because
they
could
only
sue
in
the
federal
court.
unknown
speaker
can
you
point
to
specific
instances
in
which
the
states
have
relied
on
hans
v.
louisiana?
you
say
there's
a
general
understanding.
unknown
speaker
can
we
really
say
the
states
have
somehow
relied
on
hans
v.
louisiana?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
there's
any
historical
evidence
that
the
states
have
behaved
differently
because
hans
v.
louisiana
is
on
the
books?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
that's
so,
would
it
be
fair
to
say
that
the
states
have
not,
and
really
could
not
rely
on
hans
v.
louisiana?
unknown
speaker
but
you
can
point
to
nothing
specific?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
could
speculate
about
a
lot
of
things,
i
suppose,
couldn't
you?
i
could
say
states
might
not
have
gotten
into
all
sorts
of
businesses
that
they
are
now
in
if
they
knew
that
they
could
be
subjected
without
their
own
consent
to
civil
liability,
liability
to
private
individuals.
you
might
speculate
that.
unknown
speaker
or
you
might
speculate
that
the
seventeenth
amendment
might
not
have
been
supported
by
the
states
if
they
knew
that
along
with
it
went
their
inability
as
states
to
prevent
the
assessment
of
liability
to
private
individuals.
unknown
speaker
we
really
don't
know,
i
suppose,
do
we?
unknown
speaker
well,
one
can
also,
i
assume,
presume
that
the
state
would
generally
obey
the
law,
and
its
policy
would
be
to
obey
the
law.
it
certainly
wouldn't
say
i'll
buy
this
hazardous
piece
of
property
because
i
know
nobody
can
sue
us
whereas
they
might
sue
a
private
party.
i
would
assume
they
are
conscious
of
their
obligations
to
conform
to
the
law,
and
we
should
presume
they--
unknown
speaker
--that
they
wouldn't
take
a
course
of
action
just
because
they
felt
they
wouldn't
get
sued.
well,
they
would
be
sued,
i
take
it,
by
the
federal
government
under
this
statute
if
they
mismanaged
hazardous
property.
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
you,
what
was
the
basis
for
the
third
party
claim
against
the
state?
i
mean,
what
provision
allows
such
a
claim,
purported
to
allow
such
a
claim?
unknown
speaker
and
that
covers
a
suit
by
a,
a
suit
by
a
private
party
against
another
private
party
who
was
an
owner.
unknown
speaker
so
that's
where
a
private
party
gets
the
authority.
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
sara
said
that,
that
amendment
said
that
the
involuntary
state
operator
is
liable
if
he
contributes
to
the
discharge.
unknown
speaker
yes,
all
right,
to
the
same
extent
as
a
private
party,
a
private
owner
would
be
under
9607.
unknown
speaker
now,
isn't
that
on...
doesn't
that
on
its
face
suggest
that
the
state
was
to
be
suable
under
9607
to
the
same
extent
as
a
private
party?
unknown
speaker
because
if
an
involuntary
state
owner
and
subsequent
discharger
is
liable
to
a
private
party,
you
would
think
a
voluntary,
a
state
which
has
voluntarily
gotten
into
that
position,
would
be,
too.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
knorr.
i
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
swift.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
the
notion
that
the
states'
compliance
with
the
constitution
has
to
be
enforced
by
private
suits
in
civil,
in
federal
courts
is
no
stronger,
it
seems
to
me,
than
the
notion
that
the
federal
government's
compliance
with
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
has
to
be
enforced
by
private
suits
in
federal
courts,
is
it?
is
there
any
reason
why
the
one
is
more
essential
to
preserving
the
constitution
than
the
other?
unknown
speaker
but
we
have
a
doctrine
of
federal
sovereign
immunity,
don't
we?
unknown
speaker
and
where
is,
where
is
that
writ
in
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
why
whether
it
created
them
would
be
the
reason
for
the
implication.
it
seems
to
me
the
reason
for
the
implication
would
be
the
necessity
of
the
matter.
i
don't
see
the
necessity
for
suit
in
one
case
any
more
than
the
other.
unknown
speaker
is
that
an
additional
argument,
that
congress
would
have
restricted
its
own
power
to
create
private
causes
of
action,
is
that
an
additional
argument
in
support
of
your
view
of--
unknown
speaker
--well,
was
congress
thinking
much
in
1794
about
creating
private
causes
of
action
in
which
people
could
sue
states?
unknown
speaker
so
why
would
congress's
unwillingness
to
circumscribe
its
ability
to
create
private
causes
of
action
against
states
have
loomed
large
to
any
congress
that
was
sitting
in
1794?
unknown
speaker
but
why
would
congress
have
worried?
i
mean,
if
they
weren't
thinking
about
creating
any
private
causes
of
action
against
states,
why
would
that
have
concerned
them?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
some
state
may
have
resisted
doing
that
or
been
unwilling
to
do
that
if
it
thought
it
could
be
sued
in
the
federal
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
states
have
dismantled
the
notion
of
sovereign
immunity?
unknown
speaker
and
have
they
dismantled
it
so
that
they
can
be
sued
in
federal
court
despite
the
eleventh
amendment?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
other
states?
do
states
allow
themselves
to
be
sued
in
the
state
courts
of
other
states
where
they
have
waived
sovereign
immunity?
i
mean,
it
is
one
thing
to
say
i'll
be
sued
in
my
own
courts.
i,
you
know,
if
it's
my
court
i
would
feel
pretty
happy
about
it.
[laughter]
but
have
the
states,
have
the
states
allowed
themselves
to
be
sued
in
the
courts
of
foreign
states?
unknown
speaker
but
when
a
state
so-called
dismantles
sovereign
immunity,
does
it...
has
any
state
gone
on
and
said
well,
and
you
may
sue
us
in
a
federal
court?
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose,
then,
and
perhaps
they
wouldn't
have
been
as
willing
to
permit
suit
if
they
thought
they
could
be
sued
in
federal
courts
as
well
as
state
courts.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
doesn't
quite
answer
my
question,
but
that's
all
right.
i
didn't
quite
understand
your
answer
to
justice
scalia.
are
you
suggesting
that
a
state
is
not
suable
in
the
courts
of
another
state?
unknown
speaker
because
we
held
to
the
contrary
on
that.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
on
your
consent
part,
do
you
think
a
state
could
consent
to
diversity
jurisdiction
if
an
action
was
brought
by
a
citizen
of
another
state?
unknown
speaker
well,
say
a
citizen
of
new
york
would
like
to
sue
the
state
of
pennsylvania
in
the
federal
court
in
pennsylvania.
could
the
state
of
pennsylvania
consent
to
that
diversity
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
i
know
in
a
lot
of
federal
question
cases,
but
do
you...
but
i'm
just
asking
you,
under
your
theory
of
what,
of
the
proper
construction
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
could
diverse...
could
the
state
of
pennsylvania
consent
to
a
diversity
action
brought
by
a
citizen
of
new
york?
unknown
speaker
so
they
could--
unknown
speaker
--or
anybody
else
under
this
statute.
unknown
speaker
exactly.
where
is
the
provision
that
provides
for
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
is
it
expressed?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
that's
all
right,
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
is
it
in
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
has
pennsylvania
waived
its
sovereign
immunity
to
tort
suits
generally?
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
other
theory
nuisance,
ryland
v.
fletcher
type
of
action
that
this
union
gas
could
have
relied
on
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
would
union
gas
have
had
a
independent
right
of
recovery
under
state
law?
unknown
speaker
so
the
state
has
not
waived
its
sovereign
immunity
in
this
instance.
unknown
speaker
if
we
adopted
that
for
this
purpose,
why
wouldn't...
why
wouldn't
it
apply
for
diversity
purposes
as
well?
suppose
congress
says
under
the
commerce
clause
we
think
it's
important
that
diversity
suits
against
a
state
should
lie?
unknown
speaker
oh,
but
you're
saying
that
that's
just...
that's
not
a
jurisdiction
preclusion
clause.
unknown
speaker
oh,
no,
when
you
said
it's
a
preclusion
clause,
i
thought
you
also
meant
it's
a
preclusion
clause
as
to
any,
any
suits
by
private
individuals
against
the
states.
unknown
speaker
oh,
you're
not
admitting
that
for
purposes
of
this
argument.
unknown
speaker
then
i
don't
see
what
this
argument...
i
thought
you
were.
unknown
speaker
and
i
take
it
there's
nothing
that
would
prevent
the
congress
from
imposing
punitive
damages
on
states?
unknown
speaker
well,
there...
you
have
no
evidence
really
that
state
senators
deem
themselves
representatives
of
a
state
as
an
entity
as
opposed
to
the
individual
constituents?
in
fact,
isn't
the
evidence
the
opposite?
unknown
speaker
and
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
when
the
seventeenth
amendment
abrogated
that,
hans
v.
louisiana
was
on
the
books.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
language
here
differs
from
the
language
in
employees--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
rely
principally
on
the
definitional
section
in
the
amendment?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
make
of,
what
do
you
make
of
the
9607(d)(2)
which
i
take
it
was
a
part
of
this
same
amendment?
it
says
no
state
or
local
government
shall
be
liable
under
this
subchapter
for
costs
or
damages
as
a
result
of
actions
taken
in
response
to
an
emergency,
but
it
says
this
paragraph
shall
not
preclude
liability
for
costs
or
damages
as
a
result
of
gross
negligence
or
intentional
misconduct
by
a
state
or
local
government?
unknown
speaker
but
you've
never
mentioned
that,
have
you?
unknown
speaker
does
the
section
that
justice
white
just
referred
to,
does
that
provide
for
liability
to
private
individuals
necessarily,
that
provision?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
that
liability
could
just
be
referring
to
liability
to
suit
by
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
sure,
but--
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
this
specific
provision
puts
the
state
and
the
local
government,
speaks
of
both
of
them
in
the
same
breath.
unknown
speaker
and
yet
no
one
suggests
that
the
local
government
is
immune
from
suit
by
a
private
party.
unknown
speaker
mr.
swift,
i'd
like
to
come
back
because
i'm
not
sure
we
understood
each
other,
to
your
argument
saying
that
even
if
there
is
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
congress
can
eliminate
it
by
statute.
i
find
that
hard
to
understand.
unknown
speaker
we
are
assuming,
i
think
we
have
to
be
assuming
for
purposes
of
your
argument
that
the
eleventh
amendment
both
eliminates
diversity
jurisdiction
over
the
state's
right
in
federal
court,
and
eliminates,
eliminates
federal
question
suits
against
states.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
a
separate
argument.
i
mean,
that's
the
different
argument.
that's
the
argument
that
we
overrule
hans.
i
thought
this
was
a
supplemental
argument
saying
even
if
we
don't
overrule
hans--
unknown
speaker
--the
federal
government
can,
by
statute,
eliminate
its
effect.
now,
that
argument
has
to
assume
that
hans
is
right.
unknown
speaker
okay.
so
you're
with
me
so
far.
unknown
speaker
now,
if
you
can
eliminate
the
hans
portion
that
you
don't
like
by
statute,
why
can't
you
eliminate
the
diversity
portion
by
statute
as
well,
under
the
commerce
clause?
congress
says
under
the
commerce
clause,
we
now
decide
that
it's
a
good
thing
to
have
diversity
jurisdiction
over
states.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
that's
an
argument
to
the
effect
that
hans
was
decided
wrong.
i
don't
think
it's
an
argument
to
the
effect
that
if
hans
was
decided
right
we
can
ignore
it.
unknown
speaker
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
swift.
mr.
knorr,
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
the
waiver
would
have
covered
that.
unknown
speaker
but
they
don't
exclude,
they
don't
exclude
actions
against
the
state
arising
under
federal
statute.
