mr.
robert
a.
swift
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress's
purpose
in
achieving
a
comprehensive
clean-up
of
contamination
sites
in
the
united
states
will
be
frustrated
if
an
important
participant
in
the
cause
of
that
contamination,
the
states,
cannot
be
sued
for
damages
by
private
individuals.
in
seeking
affirmance
of
the
result
in
the
lower
court,
union
gas
urges
this
court
first
to
overrule
hans
v.
louisiana
or,
absent
that,
to
rule
that
congress
was
authorized
to,
empowered
and
did
abrogate
state
immunity
from
private
suit
in
cercla.
let
me
address
hans
v.
louisiana
first.
hans
improperly
extended
the
eleventh
amendment
to
bar
causes
of
actions
well
beyond
its
plain
meaning.
hans
was
based
on
a
pre-constitutional
notion
that
states
enjoyed
sovereign
immunity
and
that
this
was
incorporated
into
the
constitution
by
implication.
the
constitution,
after
all,
was
a
compact
of
the
people
to
form
a
nation
and
create
a
sovereign
power.
it
was
a
system
of
delegated
powers
in
which
the
people
surrendered
much
of
the
state's
power
to
a
national
government.
the
constitution
assumed
the
existence
of
the
states
by
placing
prohibitions
on
them,
but
it
did
not
grant
the
states
substantive
sovereign
rights.
the
constitution
itself
contains
no
express
or
implied
grant
of
sovereign
immunity.
the
states
did,
however,
retain
sovereignty
as
to
matters
not
delegated
to
the
federal
government,
but
at
least
as
regards
the
commerce
clause,
state
sovereignty
was
surrendered
by
the
people.
essential
to
the
constitutional
framework
was
that
the
federal
courts,
this
court,
would
have
the
final
say
as
to
the
constitution,
the
federal
laws,
and
the
treaties.
thus,
article
iii
of
the
constitution
defines
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
in
categories
of
subject
matter
as
well
as
parties.
the
federal
courts,
on
one
hand,
were
entrusted
with
being
the
interpreters
of
the
constitution,
laws
and
treaties;
and
secondly,
with
being
the
neutral
forum
for
diverse
parties.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
in
terms
of
preserving
the
constitution,
i
think
the
important
part
is
that
both
be
subject
to
suit
in
federal
court--
mr.
robert
a.
swift
--well,
yes,
that's
correct,
we
do
have
a
doctrine,
but--
mr.
robert
a.
swift
--well,
that
is
implied
into
the
constitution
because
the
constitution
was
what
created
the
united
states
as
the
sovereign.
it
did
not
create
states
as
sovereigns.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
it
may
be
then,
mr.
justice,
you
may
be
leading
to
this,
that
sovereign
immunity
itself
is
an
outmoded
concept;
it's
a
relic
of
the
law.
and
bear
in
mind...
i
know
you're
familiar
with
the
academics
and
the
history
and
the
scholars
in
this
area,
but
when
the
colonies
were
originally
formed,
most
of
their
charters
provided
that
they
could
sue
and
be
sued
in
the
courts.
and
when
the
nation
was
formed
under
that
constitution,
the
states...
the
people
gave
up
much
of
the
rights
of
the
states.
and
certainly
the
language
of
article
iii,
literally
read,
would
indicate
that
they
understood
state
citizen
diversity
as
being
one
grounds,
and
a
separate
ground
for
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
courts,
as
well
as
federal
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
what
this
leads
up
to,
and
i
think
it's
appropriate
to
get
to,
is
the
chisholm
case.
chisholm
presented
the
first
test
of
federal
court
jurisdiction
over
an
action
against
a
state
by
a
citizen
of
another
state
for
money
damages.
now,
the
facts
of
chisholm
i
know
are
well
known
to
this
court.
they've
been
discussed
in
many
of
your
decisions.
what
is
important
about
chisholm
is
that
jurisdiction
was
predicated
on
the
state
citizen
diversity
clause
of
article
iii
which
has
codified
by
the
judiciary
act
of
1789.
i
submit
that
chisholm
holding
that
the
court
did
have
jurisdiction
was
a
correct
one.
justice
wilson
and
attorney
general
randolph
who
participated
in
the
case
had
been
members
of
the
committee
of
detail
that
drafted
article
iii
of
the
constitution,
and
jurisdiction
was
consistent
with
the
literal
language
of
article
iii
and
that
judiciary
act.
it
follows
that
the
eleventh
amendment
adopted
in
1794
which
overturned
chisholm
was
a
narrowly
drawn
jurisdiction
preclusion
clause
which
left
untouched
federal
subject
matter
jurisdiction
over
the
states.
if
congress
had
intended
to
grant
the
states
sovereign
immunity,
certainly
the
last
14
words
of
the
amendment
were
superfluous.
those
14
words
are
remarkably
congruent
with
the
state
citizen
diversity
clause
of
article
iii.
furthermore,
if
congress
had
intended
in
the
eleventh
amendment
to
grant
broad
sovereign
immunity
to
the
states,
then
it
would
have
restricted
its
own
power
to
create
private
causes
of
action
for
individuals
against
the
states.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
i
believe
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
well,
i
don't
believe
congress
was
because,
as
you
know,
the
great
expansion
in
congress's
power
and
where
they
enacted
a
lot
of
individual
rights,
came
after
the
civil
war,
after--
mr.
robert
a.
swift
--because
it
would
have
been
consistent
with
granting
substantive
sovereign
immunity
at
that
time.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
well,
i,
of
course,
can't
put
myself
in
the
shoes
of
congress
at
that
time,
but
certainly
at
that
time
they
were
very
concerned
about
their
own
jurisdiction
in
federal
subject
matter
cases,
treaty
cases,
for
example,
and
i
believe
congress
wanted
to
leave
itself
all
the
powers
it
needed
to
exercise
its
article
i
rights.
i
submit
that
this
court's
eleventh
amendment
jurisprudence
built
on
hans
is
unstable
and
incoherent.
hans'
notion
that
state
sovereign
immunity
is
implicit
in
the
constitution
is
today
assailed
by
an
overwhelming
consensus
of
legal
scholars
who
believe
hans
was
an
error
of
constitutional
interpretation.
hans
was
also
based
on
a
notion
that
state
sovereign
immunity
was
an
essential
foundation
of
the
constitution.
that
notion
today
is
outmoded,
and
a
majority
of
the
states
have
fully
or
partially
dismantled
sovereign
immunity
in
their
own
states.
pennsylvania
is
a
good
example.
the
federal
government
is
another
example
of
the
partial
dismantlement
of
sovereign
immunity,
where
individuals
may
bring
causes
of
action
against
the
federal
government
in
federal
court.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
your
honor's
question.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
many
have
in
their
own
states,
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
i
don't
think
that
whether
a
state
chose
to
or
not
can
affect
their
liability
under
federal
law.
it's
for
congress
to
make
that
decision
and
the
constitution,
first,
to
make
that
decision.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
as
a
general
matter,
no,
and
that's
of
course
the
reason
for
having
the
national
court
system,
the
federal
court
system
whereby
those...
there
would
be
diversity
of
citizenship.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
not
to
my
knowledge,
mr.
justice.
now,
to
vindicate--
mr.
robert
a.
swift
--well,
i
submit
that
the
framers
initially
contemplated
that,
and
certainly
that's
consistent
both
with
chisholm
and
the
passage--
mr.
robert
a.
swift
--no,
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
i
think--
mr.
robert
a.
swift
--i
think
you
have.
now,
to
vindicate
important
principles
of
federalism,
this
court
has
resorted
to
exceptions
and
fiction
in
its
eleventh
amendment
jurisprudence.
for
example,
this
court
allows
actions
for
prospective
injunction...
injunctive
relief
against
state
officials
so
long
as
the
state
itself
isn't
sued.
another
example
used
by
pennsylvania:
states
can
bootstrap
this
court's
jurisdiction
by
consenting
to
jurisdiction.
also,
counties
and
municipalities
have
no
immunity,
and
also...
and
which
we'll...
i'll
discuss
in
a
moment...
congress
may
abrogate
state
sovereign
immunity.
this
is
an
exception
that
this
court
has
created
to
vindicate
those
important
principles
of
federalism
after
hans.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
i'm
not,
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
i
think
under
the
constitution
there's
a
problem;
the
constitution
being
a
system
of
delegated
powers,
that
it
isn't
up
to
a
state
to
decide
what
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
is
to
be.
but
that
is
a
doctrine
that
this
court
has
used
as
an
exception.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
not
under
the
theory
that
i
have
espoused
today.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
and
it's
similar,
and
this
is
an
easy
way
of
thinking
of
it,
to
the
principle
that
parties
may
not
by
consent
stipulate
to
federal
court
jurisdiction.
by
overturning
hans,
this
court
can
instill
clarity
and
fairness
in
its
eleventh
amendment
jurisprudence.
congress
has
created
numerus
federal
rights
since
hans,
rights
that
often
can
best
be
vindicated
by
private
action
against
violators
for
monetary
awards.
prospective
injunctive
relief
is
frequently
not
enough.
in
certain
statutes
such
as
cercla,
congress
permitted
individual
actions
against
states
but
granted
the
federal
courts
exclusive
jurisdiction,
and
this
gets
to
the
point
that
mr.
justice
white
raised
earlier
during
pennsylvania's
argument,
that
this
is
a
statute
that
is
jealous
of
the
interpretation
to
be
placed
on
it
and
provided
that
the
federal
system
was
to
have
exclusive
jurisdiction.
so
pennsylvania
cannot
sue...
rather,
union
gas
cannot
sue
pennsylvania
in
state
court.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
union
gas
can
sue
other
parties...
well,
that's
correct,
not
in
state
court
in
pennsylvania.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
i
believe
it--
mr.
robert
a.
swift
--it's
in
112
or
113.
i
will
find
it
for
you
in
a
moment.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
it's
in
113(b),
which
is
at
42
u.s.c.
9613.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
yes,
it
is.
in
this
case,
it
would
be
unfair
to
prevent
union
gas
from
recovering
a
monetary
award
against
pennsylvania
which
caused
the
release
of
the
contamination
that
union
gas
has
now
paid
to
clean
up.
overturning
hans
will
not
result
in
a
wholesale
change
in
the
result
of
eleventh
amendment
decisions
of
this
court--
mr.
robert
a.
swift
--it
has
partially
waived
that
immunity
by
statute.
in
pennsylvania--
mr.
robert
a.
swift
--well,
not
in
this
case
because
this
was
an
action
begun
by
the
united
states
suing
union
gas.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
not
necessarily
because
that
right
may
be
cut
off
by
the
state
sovereign
immunity
act.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
that's
an
issue
that
hasn't
been
litigated.
i'm
not
prepared
to
concede
it
one
way
or
another.
overturning
hans
won't
result
in
a
wholesale
change
in
this
court's
eleventh
amendment
jurisprudence.
a
couple
examples
i
think
should
suffice.
in
both
atascadero
and
employees,
the
results
in
those
cases
were
changed
by
congress,
in
both
cases
within
a
year
or
two
after
this
court
found
insufficient
evidence
of
congressional
intent
to
abrogate.
as
with
regard
to
state
law
claims,
there
probably
would
be
no
change.
once
again,
so
long
as
this
court
were
to
continue
a
requirement
that
there
be
some
intention
stated
within
the
act
that
states
are
among
those
parties
that
can
be
sued,
that
should
be
sufficient.
for
example,
the
clarity
that
i
would
suggest
would
be
that
which
this
court
requires
in
interpreting
criminal
statutes
because
i
think
that
if
a
criminal
statute
is
clear
enough
to
deprive
someone
of
their
own
personal
liberty,
certainly
there
should
be
no
higher
standard
of
clarity
when...
in
an
action
seeking
monetary
damages
against
the
state.
now,
but
assuming
the
continued
vitality
of
hans,
this
court
should
nonetheless
treat
the
eleventh
amendment
as
a
jurisdiction
preclusion
clause,
not
a
blanket
grant
of
sovereign
immunity.
congress
has
authority
under
article
i
of
the
constitution
to
abrogate
the
eleventh
amendment's
jurisdiction
preclusion.
congress
must
have
the
authority
necessary
to
exercise
its
delegated
powers
under
article
i.
the
eleventh
amendment,
after
all,
places
no
constraint
on
congress.
the
only
constraint
is
upon
the
judicial
system.
for
congress
to
exercise
its
delegated
powers,
the
judicial
branch
must
have
co-equal
power
to
enforce
its
laws.
this
was
certainly
the
view
of
chief
justice
marshall
writing
in
cohens
v.
virginia.
only
if
the
eleventh
amendment
is
construed
as
a
jurisdiction
preclusion
clause
which
can
be
abrogated
can
the
laws
of
congress
be
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
as
the
constitution
declares
they
must.
i'd
like
to
turn--
mr.
robert
a.
swift
--because
that's
directly
prohibited
by
the
eleventh
amendment.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
i
am
saying
the
eleventh,
the
eleventh
amendment
is
a
jurisdiction
preclusion
clause,
that
it
precludes
citizen
state
diversity
cases
but
not
the
federal
subject
matter
cases.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
no,
that
wasn't
what
i
meant.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
absolutely
not.
in
fact,
my
view
is
to
the
contrary.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
cercla
is
amended--
mr.
robert
a.
swift
--that's
correct,
within
the
statutory
scheme,
bearing
in
mind
that
the...
where
the
states
are
protected
is
through
their
elected
representatives
in
congress.
this
doesn't
occur
in
a
vacuum,
and
that,
and
i
don't
believe
is
consistent,
with
this
court's
holdings
in
garcia
v.
san
antonio.
turning
to
the--
mr.
robert
a.
swift
--well,
it's
interesting
you
raise
that.
well,
you
may
recall
that
under
the
constitution
as
originally
written
and
until
amended
in
1913,
the
state
legislatures
actually
elected
the
senators,
so
there
was--
mr.
robert
a.
swift
--that's
true,
that's
true.
but
i
submit
that
hans
was
a
case
of
a
different
time
and
political
climate,
certainly
where
the
court
was
very
concerned
about
another
secession
by
the
southern
states,
very
concerned
about
the
states'
treasuries
being
emptied
by
virtue
of
the
debt
collection
cases,
and
also
very
concerned
as
it
spoke
at
the
end
of
the
hans
decision,
that
it's
immoral
for
states
to
change
their
constitutions
to
prohibit
debt
collection.
i'd
like
to
address
the
statutory
interpretation
for
a
moment,
if
i
may.
cercla
defines
persons
liable
under
section
107
to
include
states.
this
is
virtually
the
same
definitional
language
that
this
court
found
to
be
clear
evidence
of
abrogation
in
fitzpatrick
v.
bitzer,
and
bear
in
mind,
fitzpatrick
v.
bitzer
came
three
years
after
this
court's
employees
decision
and
two
years
after
congress
had
legislatively
overturned
the
employees
decision.
fitzpatrick
v.
bitzer,
you'll
recall,
involved
a
challenge
by
the
states
to
liability
for
monetary
damage
actions
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
and
in
that
statute,
the
persons
who
were
defined
to
be
liable
were
governments
and
governmental
agencies.
i
submit
that
the
language
here
which
uses
the
word
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist
wrote
about
as
being
clear
in
fitzpatrick
v.
bitzer.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
i
do.
i
think
it's
stronger,
and
also
employees,
bear
in
mind,
was
an
amendment
to
an
act.
this
was
an
original
act
that
defined
states
as
being
liable.
in
employees,
we
had
a
history
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
of
30
years
where
states
were
not
liable,
and
we
had
amendments
in
1966
which
changed
that,
or
appeared
to
change
just
the
definition
without
changing
the
liability
aspects.
and
there
is
another
important
distinction
which
relates
to
justice
white's
question,
and
that
is
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
the
department
of
labor
could
bring
suit,
or
private
individuals
could
bring
suit
in
state
courts.
here
there
is
no
such
opportunity.
union
gas
can't
sue
pennsylvania
in
state
court
under
this
act.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
well,
i
do,
but
it
was,
as
you
commented
earlier,
it
was
amended
in
sara,
and
that
language
that
you
singled
out,
mr.
justice,
was
a
virtual
replication
of
the
language
that
the
federal
government
used
in
section
120
of
the
act
to
waive
its
own
sovereign
immunity,
and
if
there
were
ever
clear
language,
i
submit
this
is
it.
now,
pennsylvania
also
commented
that
nowhere
in
this
act
is
the
eleventh
amendment
referred
to.
well,
i
would
refer
the
court--
mr.
robert
a.
swift
--i
think
that's
supportive
language.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
no.
well,
i
think,
i
believe
it
was
mentioned
in
the
court
below,
but
it
wasn't
one
of
the
things
that
we
briefed.
but
i
think
that
is
supportive
language
that
your
honor
has
seized
upon.
but
i
think
even
more
important,
as
pennsylvania
mentioned,
there's
no
reference
to
the
eleventh
amendment
in
this
statute.
well,
i
suggest
that
the
court
read
section
159
of
the
act
which
deals
with
citizen
suits,
and
there
congress
was
very
careful
to
say
that
people
may
bring
citizen
suits,
but
subject
to
the
eleventh
amendment.
so
there
is
a
clear
distinction
between
section
107(a),
which
is
your
general
liability
clause,
and
citizen
suits,
which
were
specialized
suits,
not
by
people
who
had
spent
money
in
a
clean-up
but
people
who
wanted
to
sue
to
enforce
an
order
of
a
federal
agency.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
i
don't
believe
it
does
refer
to
it.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
well,
i
submit
that's
not
how
i
would
read
the
act.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
but
after
all,
mr.
justice,
this
was...
the
name
of
this
act
was
the
comprehensive
act
to
clean
up,
and
this
didn't
occur
in
a
vacuum.
it
came
after
efforts
by
congress,
several
acts
which
proved--
mr.
robert
a.
swift
--that's
right.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
that's
right,
but
you
see,
the
concept
of
the
act
is
to
have
a
general
liability
clause
with
an
exception,
such
as
an
exception
for
the
sites
that
are
involuntarily
acquired.
and
mr.
justice,
you
seized
on
a
point
earlier
in
asking
pennsylvania
a
question
that
i'd
like
to
elaborate
on.
and
that
is
they
seize
on
this
exception
in
the
sara
amendment
to
the
definition
of
owner
operator
as
being
indication
that
states
were
not
intended
to
be
subject
to
suit
under
this
act.
i
submit
that
it's
illogical
to
suggest
that
they
can
be
liable
for
sites
that
are
involuntarily
acquired
where
they
then
cause
the
contamination
but
they
can't
be
sued
if
they
buy
the
property
next
door
to
me
and
contaminate
it
and
it
runs
off
onto
my
land.
that's
just
an
illogical
interpretation
of
the
act.
i
think
the
logical
interpretation
is
that
there's
general
liability
under
section
107
and
that
this
definition
provides
one
exception.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
well,
the
argument--
mr.
robert
a.
swift
--i
don't
think
that
necessarily
follows.
i
read
the
language
of
the
eleventh
amendment
literally,
and--
mr.
robert
a.
swift
--that's
correct.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
i'm
with
you.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
i
don't
know
that
i
have
a
good
answer
to
that,
mr.
justice.
but
the
point
that
i've
harped
upon
is
that
congress
must
have
its
core
powers
unfettered.
those
powers
include
the
power
under
article
i,
section
8,
which
is
the
commerce
clause,
and
that
power...
if
congress
determines
that
in
order
to
vindicate
its
power
it
must
establish
private
damage
remedies
against
parties
that
include
states,
then
i
submit
that
the
constitutional
scheme
permits
that.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
the
other
point
i
would
make
with
regard
to
the
statute
is
that
within
this
scheme
where
the
congress
had
legislation
that
wasn't
effectively
cleaning
up
the
contamination
sites
in
this
country,
where
in
each
of
those
acts
it
had
provided
for
exemption
for
the
states,
the
clean
air
act,
the
clean
water
act,
the
resource
conservation
and
recovery
act,
each
gave
that
broad
exemption.
but
cercla,
coming
in
1980,
did
not
and
i
submit
that
that
is
strong
evidence
of
congress's
intention
with
regard
to
this
statute.
and
another
strong
indicia
is
the
fact
that
the
federal
government
waived
its
own
liability,
and
it
didn't
just
waive
it
in
general
terms.
it
said
as
to
the
executive
branch,
the
congressional
branch
and
even
this
court
can
be
sued
in
federal
court
should
it
cause
contamination.
and
the
concept,
the
overriding
concept
is
that
we
all
need
to
pull
together,
we
all
need
to
clean
up
these
sites.
it's
a
matter
of
the
national
health
and
safety.
in
closing,
i'd
like
to
observe
that
sovereign
immunity
is
a
relic
that
has
persisted
in
the
law
despite
the
law's
evolution.
state
sovereign
immunity
is
not
required
by
nor
implied
in
our
constitution.
and
its
persistence
undermines
basic
tenets
of
federalism.
this
is
the
first
eleventh
amendment
case
before
this
court
where
there
is
no
redress
for
the
state's
wrong
unless
the
claim
can
be
presented
in
federal
court.
congress's
purpose
in
achieving
a
comprehensive
clean-up
of
contamination
sites
in
the
united
states
will
be
frustrated
if
an
important
participant
in
the
cause
of
that
contamination,
the
states,
cannot
be
sued
for
damages
by
private
individuals.
the
means
for
permitting
union
gas
to
obtain
redress
is
to
overturn
hans
v.
louisiana.
