mr.
christopher
j.
wright
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
the
court
below
stated,
this
case
involves
a
situation
where
every
dollar
saved
by
firestone
is
a
dollar
in
its
pocket.
and
firestone's
construction
of
the
terms
of
its
severance
pay
plan
not
to
require
payments
to
the
plaintiff
class
saved
it
more
than
6
million
dollars
here.
in
a
situation
like
this,
deferring
to
firestone's
construction
of
the
terms
of
its
plan
would
undermine
the
most
basic
policy
underlying
erisa,
which
is
ensuring
that
employees
get
the
benefits
that
they've
been
promised.
because
firestone
administers
its
plan
itself
and
pays
benefits
out
of
general
assets
rather
than
from
a
trust
fund,
the
only
approach
that
is
consistent
with
erisa's
purposes
and
the
rule
that
the
united
states
believes
should
be
adopted
as
a
matter
of
federal
common
law
under
section
502(a)(1)(b)
is
that
contract
principles
govern
here.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
if
it
were
a
section
302
sort
of
plan
with
both
a
trust
and
an
independent
trustee,
then
we
think...
the
question
is
not
presented
here.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
as,
as
a
matter
of
federal--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--as
a
matter
of
federal
common
law,
we
think
that
this
court
might
arise...
might
arrive
at...
at
that
view.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
in,
in...
in
that
case,
which
isn't
presented
here
because
we
don't
have
a
neutral
trustee
and
a
funded
plan.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
mr.
silberman
and
i--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well
under
trust
law...
we,
we,
we
agree
that
under
trust
law,
discretion
should
be
given
only
where
discretion
is
granted.
and
we
certainly
agree
that
no
discretion
has
been
granted
to
administrators
of
an
employee
benefit
plans.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
to
construe
an
instrument.
now,
whether...
and
mr.
silberman
and
i
are
in
perfect
agreement
that
in
this
case
involving
an
unfunded
plan
and
biased
administrators,
it,
it
would...
it
would
make
no
sense
whatever
to
defer
to
the--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
we
see
no
reason
why...
we
think
that
the,
the...
really
the
only
position
that
we
think
has
much
merit
in
petitioners'
position
is
that
congress
did
want
to
keep
the
costs
of
administering
employee
benefit
plans
as
low
as
possible.
we're
not
sure
that
the...
applying
a
deferential
standard
really
does
that.
and,
and
i
hope
to
get
a
chance
to
say
more
about
that
later.
but
to
the
extent
that
it
might
on
the
margin
in
a
case
that
presents
the
issue,
we
think
that
this
court
might
decide
that
deference
could
be
paid
where
there's
a
truly
neutral
administrator
and
a
funded
plan.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
no.
the
court
of
appeals
certainly
stressed
the
fact
that
there
is
a...
is
a
biased
administrator
here.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
the
court
did
not...
i,
i
don't
think
that
i'm
disagreeing
with
judge
becker's
fine
opinion.
i
would
hope
to
flesh
it
out
perhaps
a
bit
by
adding
an
introductory
paragraph
that--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
judge
becker
recognized
that
there
is
a
biased
administrator
here.
i
assume
that
it
was
thomas
e.
robinson,
the
same
person
who,
who
decided
not
to
give
documents
to
the
three
plaintiffs
who
requested
them,
a
decision
that
has
been
called
from
the
bench
as,
as
mad
and
i
think
inexplicable.
that
is
the
person
whose,
whose
decision
firestone
would,
would
have...
have
the
courts
defer
to
here.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
we
think
that
it's
perfectly--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--we
think
it's
clear
that
federal
common
law
applies.
congress
has
made
that
clear.
we
think
that
it's
clear
that
in
construing
erisa,
in
many
areas
of
erisa,
trust
principles
will
apply.
in,
in
many
plans,
there
are
trust
funds.
here
there
is
no
trust
fund,
and
trust
law...
section
<seventy-four>
[=
74]
of
the
restatement
says
that
where
there's
no
trust
fund,
trust
law
doesn't
apply.
you...
contract
principles
would
be
applied
in
that
situation.
now,
whether
in
another
case
involving
a
trust
fund
and
a
neutral
administrator
the
court
might
want
to
borrow
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard,
we
don't
think
that's
presented
here.
we
don't...
we
wouldn't
want
to
rule
out
that
possibility
if
it
turns
out
that
that
might,
might
be
a
cost-saving
device.
i...
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that...
that
while
a
lawyer
might
be
a
fiduciary
with
respect
to
his
client,
if
a
dispute
arose
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
pay
contract
between
the
lawyer
and
his
client,
you
certainly
wouldn't
defer
to
the
lawyer's
interpretation
of
the
contract.
so,
we
don't
think
that
just
because
someone
owes
someone
else
a
fiduciary
duty,
his
opinion
as
to
what
contracts
mean
always
gets
deference.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
exactly.
and,
and
almost
all
of
firestone's
arguments
here
start
by
saying
that
administrators
are,
are
fiduciaries
and
end
by
saying
that
therefore
they're,
they're...
ought
to
be
judged
under
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard,
and
that
seems
backward
to
us
for
the
reason
you've
just
given.
congress
meant
to
hold
them
to
the
highest
standard
possible
not,
not
to
direct
courts
to
give...
to
give
deference
to
decisions
of
what
contracts
mean
made
by
biased
administrators.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
all
pension
plans
have
to
be
funded
under
erisa.
erisa
requires
that.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
welfare
plans...
i
don't
know
the
percentage,
but,
yes,
i
think
more
than
are
not
are,
are
unfunded.
i'd
like
to
briefly
say
a
word
about
the
second
issue.
one
question
that
has
come
up
is,
is
why
didn't
congress
say...
say
claimants
in
saying
who...
who...
who's
entitled
to,
to
information.
well,
congress
wanted
to
be
broader
than
claimants.
you're,
you're
entitled
to...
to
request
documents
if
you
think
you
may
in
the
future...
if
you
want
to
find
out
if
in
the
future
you're
going
to
be
entitled
to
payments.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
no.
i
was
simply
trying
to
say
that's
why...
that's
why
they
didn't
say
claimants
in
the...
in
the
statute.
they
wanted
to
be
broad.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
a
participant
is
any
employee
or
former
employee
who
is
or
may
become
eligible.
and...
and
i'd
also
like
to
point
out
that
doesn't
include
just
anyone
who
walks
in
off
the
street.
you
at
least
have
to
be
an
employee
or
a
former
employee.
and,
and
as
the
court
below
said,
we
think
that
"is"
is
often
read
in
statutes
like
this
to
mean
claims
to
be.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
we
don't
think
it
would
be
unwise
to
read
in
such
a
requirement
so
that
if
somebody
who...
who
never...
never
participated
in
a
stock
plan
asked
for
documents,
he
wouldn't
have
a
colorable
claim.
but
as
has
been
pointed
out
from
both...
by
both
justice
kennedy
and
justice
scalia,
it...
the
decision
not
to
give
the
documents
to
a
former
employee
who
participated
in
the
plan
is,
is,
is
just
inexplicable.
and...
so,
we
don't
even
think
that
that's
a
necessary
requirement.
we
think
that
if
a
former
employee
asks
for
plans...
ask
for
plan
documents,
we
think
that
congress
plainly
wanted--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--if
i
can
just
answer
that
question.
we,
we
think
that
they
can
come
in
under
either
clause.
we
think
that
"is"
can
be
read
to
mean
claims
to
be,
and
we
think
that
a
former
employee
literally
may
become
eligible.
he
may
become
eligible
if
he
returns
to
work
for
firestone.
thank
you.
