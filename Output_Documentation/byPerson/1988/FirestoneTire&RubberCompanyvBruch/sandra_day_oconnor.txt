o'connor
the
first
of
these
cases
is
firestone
tire
&
rubber
company
versus
bruch,
no.
87-1054.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
it
requires
us
to
address
two
questions
concerning
erisa,
the
employee
retirement
income
security
act.
petitioner,
firestone
tire
&
rubber
company,
maintained
and
was
the
plan
administrator
in
fiduciary
of
a
termination
pay
plan
and
two
other
unfunded
employee
benefit
plans
governed
by
erisa.
after
firestone
sold
its
plastics
division
to
occidental
petroleum,
the
respondents,
who
are
plastic
division
employees,
rehired
by
occidental,
sought
benefits
under
the
termination
pay
plan.
firestone
denied
their
request
on
the
ground
that
there
had
not
been
a
reduction
enforced
that
authorize
benefits
under
the
terms
of
the
plan.
several
respondents
also
sought
information
about
their
benefits
under
all
three
plans
pursuant
to
a
provision
of
erisa
which
requires
plan
administrators
to
provide
information
to
plan
participants
requesting
it.
firestone
denied
those
requests
on
the
ground
that
the
respondents
were
no
longer
participants
in
the
plans.
respondents
then
filed
suit
in
federal
district
court
for
severance
benefits
and
for
damages
based
on
the
failure
to
provide
them
information.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
firestone
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
holding
that
firestone’s
denial
of
benefits
was
subject
to
de
novo
review
and
that
the
term
participant
is
to
find
in
erisa
included
any
person
who
claim
to
be,
but
in
fact
was
not,
entitled
to
benefits.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
affirm
in
part
and
reverse
in
part,
and
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals.
for
reasons
explained
in
our
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
unanimously
hold
that
a
plan
administrator’s
denial
of
benefits
is
to
be
reviewed
under
a
de
novo
standard
unless
the
plan
at
issue
gives
the
administrator
discretion
to
determine
eligibility
for
benefits
or
constru
uncertain
terms
in
the
plan.
we
also
hold
that
the
term
participant
is
to
find
in
erisa
means
either
an
employee
in
or
reasonably
expected
to
be
in
currently
covered
employment,
or
a
former
employee
who
has
a
reasonable
expectation
of
returning
to
covered
employment
or
having
a
colorable
claim
to
vested
benefits.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
