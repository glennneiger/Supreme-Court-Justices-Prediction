unknown
speaker
and
so,
this...
the
decision
turns
on
what
the
plan
means?
unknown
speaker
that's
all
i
wanted
to
know.
yeah.
so,
it's
a...
it's
a
contractual
construction
problem.
or
it's
a
construction
of
a
written
instrument.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
mr.
wald.
while
we're
on
that,
you...
you...
it's
your
understanding
that
trustees
normally
are
given
that
kind
of
deference
in
their
interpretation
of
the
trust
agreement,
that
if
the--
unknown
speaker
--what...
what
does
the
statute
say?
does
the
statute
specifically
give
them
power
to
interpret
the
instrument
with,
with
deference?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think...
don't
you
think
you
could
say
the
same
thing
about
any
trustee,
that
he'd
have
all
of
those
powers?
unknown
speaker
but
it's
not
my
impression
of
common
law
trust
law
that
if
the
trustee
makes
a
questionable
interpretation
of
the
trust
agreement,
i
wouldn't
be
able
as
one
of
the
beneficiaries
to
go
into
court
and
say
that
interpretation
is
wrong.
and
the
court
would
look
at
the
trust
agreement
and
say
it's
up
to
us
to
interpret
this
trust
agreement.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--i
don't--
unknown
speaker
--i
don't
think
that's
what
austin
scott
taught
me,
but--
[laughter]
mr.
wald,
i
share
some
of
justice
scalia's
feeling
on
that
score.
my,
my
recollection
of
trust
law...
and
it
obviously
isn't,
isn't
a
terribly
recent
one...
is
that
if
you're
talking
about
the...
the
many
things
that
the
trustee
is
given
discretion
to
do
in
a
trust
instrument,
decide
on
the
medical
needs
or
educational
needs
of
various
beneficiaries
and
allocate
discretionary
funds
among
them,
the
courts
give
great
deference
to
a
trustee.
but
is...
in
deciding
who
is
a
beneficiary,
i,
i
was
not
aware
that
trust
law
says
the
trustee
has
great
discretion
there.
unknown
speaker
there
are
two
rational
ways
of
construing
the
trust
instrument
and
the
administrator
picks
one
of
them.
that
should
be
the
end
of
it.
unknown
speaker
it's
possible.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
still
turns
on
who
the
beneficiary
was
under
the
instrument.
unknown
speaker
well,
now
to...
that
doesn't
explain
anything
to
say
determine
who
the
beneficiary
is.
if,
if
the
question
is
whether
a
particular
individual
was
employed
or
not,
for
example,
that
would
be
a
factual
question
which...
which
one
might,
indeed,
give,
give
some
deference
to
the...
to
the
trustee
on.
but
if
the
question
is
whether
conceding
all
these
facts,
such
a
person
under
the
instrument
is
entitled,
that's
a
pure
question
of
law.
and
you're
asserting
that
even
that
kind
of
a
question
we
must
defer
to
the...
to
the
trustee.
unknown
speaker
well,
as
i
understand
it,
your
opponents
concede
that
that
would
be
the
case
if
the...
if
it
were
a
funded
plan
where
there
wasn't
a
conflict
of
interest,
isn't
that
right?
i
mean,
you
aren't
in
disagreement
over
the
abuse
of
discretion
standard
of
the
trustee
on
these
very
same
questions
if
it
were
a
funded
plan
and
no
alleged
conflict
of
interest.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
i'm
just
trying
to
ascertain
the
relative
positions
of
you
and
your
opponents
in
this
case.
do
i
correctly
understand
that
everyone
agrees
that
for
the
funded
plan
where
there
is
no
alleged
conflict
of
interest,
that
the
standard
you
proposed
on
abuse
of
discretion
is
the
appropriate
standard?
unknown
speaker
at
least
as
to
that,
as
to
those
types
of
plans.
unknown
speaker
but,
of
course,
here
a
denial
benefits
the
trustee,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
respondents
say
that
congress
didn't
spell
out
the
standard
of
review
in
the
court,
and
that
it
was
left
to
the
courts
to
develop
a
so-called
federal
common
law
rule
on
the
standard
of
review.
now,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
what
would...
what
would
the
common
law
of
trusts
tell
us
or
trust
law
tell
us
about
a
trust
in
which
the
trustee
has
a
conflict
of
interest?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wald,
what
percentage
of
erisa
plans
do
you
estimate
in
the
country
are
of
the
type
that
this
plan
is,
employer-administered
and
unfunded?
unknown
speaker
but
i
don't
think
that
was
the
question.
the
question
is
what
percentage
is
unfunded.
does
that--
unknown
speaker
--break
out
the
same
as
funded?
unknown
speaker
are
unfunded?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wald,
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
making
the
argument
that
since
congress
gives
the
administrator
a
power,
it
necessarily
gives
him
discretion
with
respect
to
the
exercise
of
the
power.
and
i'm
not
sure
it
follows.
as
far
as
trust
law
is
concerned,
you,
you,
you
cite
yourself
the...
the
restatement
of
trusts.
and
what
that
says
is
where
discretion
is
conferred
upon
the
trustee
with
respect
to
the
exercise
of
a
power,
the
exercise
is
not
subject
to
the
control
by
the
court
except
to
prevent
an
abuse
of
discretion.
but
that's
crucial,
where
discretion
is
conferred
with
respect
to
the
exercise
of
a
power.
unknown
speaker
you
can
confer
a
power
without
conferring
discretion
with
respect
to,
to
its
exercise.
and
what
you
seem
to
be
saying
here
is
that
all
powers
given
to
administrators
under
this
legislation
are
powers
as
to
which
he
is
given
discretion.
and
i
don't
know
what
you
base
that
on.
unknown
speaker
what
does
it
say?
unknown
speaker
fine.
unknown
speaker
that's
the
conferral
of
a
power.
where
is
the
conferral
of
discretion
as
to
how
that
power--
unknown
speaker
--is
to
be
exercised?
unknown
speaker
that's
another
power,
but
i
don't
see
discretion--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
wald,
you're
relying
very
heavily
on
sections
402
and
503
if
i
understand
you.
unknown
speaker
have
you
set
the
text
of
those
sections
out
in
your
papers,
in
the
brief
or
the
petition?
unknown
speaker
i,
i
didn't
find
them.
where?
as
an
appendix
to
the
brief?
unknown
speaker
i,
i
don't
see
them
in,
in--
--[inaudible].
unknown
speaker
yes,
that
includes
a
lot
of
provisions
from
the
statute,
but
not
the
two
on
which
you
rely
today.
unknown
speaker
well,
your
brief
says
specifically
that
those
provisions
are
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
unknown
speaker
i
see
401(a)
and
404(a),
but
it's
402
that
you're
now
relying
on?
unknown
speaker
i'm
amazed
that
if,
it
you're
relying
on
it,
you
didn't
set
it
forth
in
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
you
prefer
nonuniformity
among
employers
instead
nonuniformity
among
the
courts.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wald,
you
have
two
questions
presented
in
your
petition
for
certiorari.
are
you
going
to
address
the
second?
unknown
speaker
in...
in
the
case
of
an
employee
who
deems
himself
a
participant
and
requests
information,
are
you
not
entitled
to
bill
him
for
the
cost
of
reproducing
the
plan
or
the
documents?
unknown
speaker
just
the
photocopy
costs?
unknown
speaker
well,
as
a
practical
matter
here,
what
was
the
cost
involved?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's...
that's
why
i'm
a
little
puzzled
about
the
case.
why,
why
did...
why
didn't
you
just
give
the
employees
what
they
wanted
here--
unknown
speaker
--and
bill
them
for
the
costs?
unknown
speaker
well,
i...
i
take
that's
discovery
after
the
claim
is
filed
or
after
a
suit
is
filed.
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
finding
to
that
effect?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wald,
if
a
participant
or
an
alleged
claimed
participant
makes
a
colorable
claim,
is
that
enough?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
third
circuit
required
that
the
requesting
party
be
making
a
colorable
claim?
unknown
speaker
i
read
it
as
not
requiring
anything
at
all.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
wald.
mr.
silberman?
unknown
speaker
suppose
that
goes
not
just
to
legal
questions,
as
i
suggested
in
an
earlier
question,
but
even...
even
to
factual
questions.
right?
i,
i
don't
suppose
that
a
trustee
can...
is
given
deference
when
he
decides
that
a
particular
individual
is
not
an
heir
or
is--
unknown
speaker
--or
is
not
a
child
of...
whose,
whose
one
of
the
beneficiaries.
i
guess
a
court...
even
though
the
trustee
made
a
judgment
that
was
in
the
ball
park,
the
court
would
inquire
into
that
on
its
own,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
i
remember.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but
i
take
it
under
your
view
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
if
this
were
a
funded
plan
with
independent
trustees.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
you've
just
told
us
that
trust
law
in
any
event--
unknown
speaker
--wouldn't
require
it.
so,
your...
your
argument
would
not
be
any
different.
unknown
speaker
for
the
result.
unknown
speaker
i,
i,
i
must
say
i,
i
begin
to,
to
depart
from
your,
your
analysis
here
if,
if
you're
saying
that
trust
law
doesn't
apply
to
any
of
these...
any
of
these
instruments
because
there
are
a
lot
of
decisions
that
the
administrator
has
to
make.
for
example,
we've
had
cases
involving
what
happens
when
one
of
the
employers
pulls
out
of
the
plan,
how
much
the
employer
must,
must
kick
in
in
order
to
make
up
for
his
accrued
liability
under
the
plan,
all
sorts
of
other
decisions
that,
that
an
administrator
makes
that
are
very
similar
to
trustee
decisions.
and
i
certainly...
i
certainly
would
think
that
it
was
congress'
intent
by
referring
to
him
as
a
fiduciary
to
impose
the
same
kind
of
liability
and
no
more
than
that
which
a
trustee
has.
and
you're...
you're
negating
all
of
that
and
saying
that
trust
law
doesn't
apply
at
all.
what
do
we
look
to?
we
make
it
up
brand
new
now.
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
for
both
types
of
plans.
you
wouldn't
distinguish
between
the
two
plans.
unknown
speaker
but
if
there
is
no
such
rule,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference,
would
it?
and
you'd
be
just
as--
unknown
speaker
--just
as
happy
if
we
said
everything
is
governed
by
trust
law
but
trust
law
comes
out
with
the
same
result
that...
that
502(b)
does
anyway.
unknown
speaker
may
i...
may
i
go
back
to
your
second
point
a
minute?
are
there
not...
i
don't
think
of
any
that
come
to
mind,
but
are
there
not
areas
the
law...
of
the
law
in
which
a
person
has
a
fiduciary
duty
to
others
even
though
that
person
is
not
technically
a
trustee
with
a
corpus
and
a
res
and
all
the
rest
of
it.
and
could
not
one
say
that
the
administrator
of
the
plan
here
does
have
fiduciary
obligations
to
the
beneficiaries
that
are
comparable
to
those
of
a
trustee?
i
mean,
i
don't...
i'm
quite
sure
i
understand
why
it's
so
significant
that
there
be
a
corpus
and
a
trust
and
all
that.
unknown
speaker
and
some
of
the
principles
of
trust
law
apply
to
the
activities
of
those
fiduciaries--
unknown
speaker
--when
they're
construing
documents
that
affect
their
responsibilities
and
the
like.
unknown
speaker
yet
the
statute
does
throughout
use
the
term
"fiduciary",
which
is
almost
a
term
of
art
in
trust
law.
unknown
speaker
you...
i'm
sure
you're
defending
the
result
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals,
but
it
doesn't
sound
like
you're
defending
its,
its
rationale.
unknown
speaker
so,
you
are...
you
are
asking
us
to
affirm
on
a
different
ground--
unknown
speaker
--as
a
respondent.
unknown
speaker
and
in,
in
effect
you
say
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong.
unknown
speaker
well,
it,
it,
it
was
right
in
the
result,
but
completely
the
wrong
approach.
it
should
have
said
this
is
a
cause
of
action
to
enforce
a
plan
and
not
go
off
on
the
notion
that
here's
a
fiduciary
with
a
conflict
of
interest.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
was
this
argument
made?
was
your
argument
you've
been
making
made
to
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
are
you
going
to
address
the
second
question
before
you're
through?
unknown
speaker
well,
before
you
do,
may
i
just
be
sure--
unknown
speaker
--i
understand
your
third
point.
i
interrupted
you
when
you
started
it,
and
i'm
not
sure
i
know
what
it
is.
if
you'd
just
tell
me
what
it
is
and
then
go
on
to
the
other.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
all
right.
go
ahead
to
the
other.
unknown
speaker
does
there
have
to
be
a
colorable
claim
made
to
being
a
participant?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
seems
so
strange
because
a
total
stranger
could
do
that.
i
mean,
i,
i
don't
understand
why
those
courts
that
have
said
there
has
to
be
at
least
a
colorable
claim
to
being
a
participant
should
be
required.
xxx
strange
that
someone
that
can
read
the
restatement
of
trust
so
precisely
could
use
the
word
"participant"
so
loosely
to
mean
somebody
who
makes
a
claim.
it's
a
very
strange
meaning
of
that
word,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
not
is
or
may
be...
not
is
or
may
be
eligible,
but
is
or
may
become.
isn't
that
quite
different
from...
if
it
said
is
or
may
be,
then
you
might
say,
well,
that
might
include
a
claimant,
but
it
isn't
may
be.
it's
may
become.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know.
it
makes
a
lot
of
sense
to
me
that
you
wouldn't
be
liable
for
damages
if,
if
the
person
was,
was
going
to
lose
on
the
merits
anyway.
i
mean,
this
is...
this
is...
we're
not
setting
up
some
agency--
unknown
speaker
--that,
that...
that
requires
due
process.
i
don't
know
why
that
makes
no
sense.
if
the
fellow
was
entitled
to
what
he
gets,
you've
violated
the
law
by
not
giving
him
a
review.
but
if
he's
just
some
outsider
and
not
involved
at
all...
as
far
as
the
information
provision
at
issue
here
is
concerned,
i,
i
think
an
employer
would
have
to
be
mad
not
to...
not
to
give
the
documents
over.
i
don't
see
how
we,
we
would
be
harming
anything
by,
by
giving
the
language
its
most
natural
reading.
if,
if
there's
any
doubt
whether
the
person
is
a
participant,
i
don't
know
why
the
employer
wouldn't
give
him
the
documents...
if
there's
any
doubt.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
silberman.
mr.
wright?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
wright,
you
would
apparently
apply
a
different
standard,
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard,
if
it
were
independent
trustees
and
a
funded
plan?
unknown
speaker
even
on
a
question
of
interpreting
the
language
of
the
contract.
unknown
speaker
you
would
say
deference
and
abuse
of
discretion--
unknown
speaker
--well,
that's
the
position
you
urge.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
certainly
isn't
the
position
being
argued
by
mr.
silberman,
who
says
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
what
kind
of
a
plan
it
is.
this
is
not
the
kind
of
issue
or
question
on
which
deference
is
given.
unknown
speaker
under
trust
law
or
otherwise.
unknown
speaker
to
misconstrue
an
instrument
you
mean.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i'm
trying
to
explore
what
the
rule
would
be
in
a
funded
plan
with
independent
trustees.
unknown
speaker
as
i--
i'd
like
to.
you
also
suggest
to
us
that...
that
if
we
rule
for
mr.
silberman's
client,
that
we
do
it
on
the
502(1)(b)
ground
rather
than
the
court
of
appeals
ground.
unknown
speaker
oh,
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
was
talking
about
a
biased...
a
conflict
of
interest
in
the
trustee,
wasn't
he?
unknown
speaker
am
i
correct
that
you
don't
really
point
to
any
language
that...
in
the
statute
that
distinguishes
between
funded
and
unfunded
plans
for
these
purposes?
you
just
think
it's
sort
of
a
good
idea
to
treat
the
two
differently,
and
therefore
we
should
do
it--
unknown
speaker
--and
declare
one
to
be
sort
of
a
trust...
subject
to
trust
type
obligations
and
the
other
one
not
because
that
works
better.
unknown
speaker
your,
your...
when
you
say
a
lawyer
is
a
fiduciary,
you
mean
they're
subjected
to
a
higher
standard
than
a
normal
contracting
party,
not
that
they
have
more
rights.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wright,
do
you
agree
with
your
opponent's
general
estimate
of
the
proportion
of
plans
that
are
unfunded
and
that
are
funded?
unknown
speaker
we're
talking
about...
we're
talking
about
severance
pay
here
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
but
that
doesn't
apply
to
these
people.
they
either
are
or
are
not.
unknown
speaker
xxx
broad,
so
they
said
participants.
that,
that's
a
strange
way
to
be
broad.
unknown
speaker
well,
does
there...
do
you
have
to
be
a
colorable...
have
to...
have
to
have
a
colorable
claim
to
benefits?
unknown
speaker
but,
but
you,
you
then
don't
give
any
effect
to
who
is
or
may
become
eligible
to
receive
a
benefit.
i
mean,
that's
a
provision
in
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
what
effect
you
give
to
that
clause.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
wright.
mr.
wald,
you
have
one
minute
remaining.
unknown
speaker
your,
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
wald.
