mr.
david
silberman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
light
of
the
discussion
to
this
point,
it
seems
to
me
appropriate
to
begin
by
discussing
precisely
what
it
is
the
statute
does
and
does
not
say
on
the
specific
question
of
the
scope
of
review.
section
402
is
a
section
which
says
that
every
employee
benefit
plan
must
be
established
and
maintained
pursuant
to
a
written
instrument,
and
in
the
second
sentence,
such
instrument
shall
provide
for
one
or
more
named
fiduciaries
who
jointly
or
severally
shall
have
authority
to
control
and
manage
the
operation
and
administration
of
the
plan.
the
conference
report
on
this
section
explains
that
a
written
plan
is
required
so
that
employees
may
know
who
is
responsible
for
operating
the
plan.
and
that's
all
that
section
402
has
to
say
is
you
have
to
have
a
plan
and
it
has
to
have
a
fiduciary
named
who's
going
to
administer
the
plan.
section
503
says
that
every
plan
must
include
a
claims
procedure,
and
the
claims
procedure
must
afford
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
any
participant
whose
claim
has
been
denied
for
full
and
fair
review
by
the
appropriate
named
fiduciary
of
the
decision
denying
the
claim.
and
that's
all
that
503
has
to
say.
and
that
is
all
the
petitioner
has
to
offer
to
say
that
the
statute
answers
the
question
of
what
the
appropriate
scope
of
review
is
here.
now,
petitioner's
argument,
as
we
understand
it,
really
rests
on
an
inference.
the
inference
is
that
because
congress
referred
to
these
people
as
fiduciaries,
it
intended
to
bring
with
it
the
law
of...
the
common
law
of
trusts.
and
we
believe
that
petitioners'
argument
fails
in
two
respects.
first,
we
think,
as
justice
scalia
developed
it,
petitioner
misunderstands
trust
law,
that
if
trust
law
applies,
we
believe
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
here.
and
second,
we
submit
that
in
any
event,
the
inference
does
not
withstand
analysis
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction.
the
statute
can't
be
read
to
require...
if
trust
law
provided
such
a
rule
of
deference,
the
statute
can't
be
read
to
so
mandate
it.
let
me
turn
first
to
what
it
is
the
trust
law
has
to
stay...
say
on
this
question.
we
believe
the
critical
point
is
the
one
that
petitioners
concede
at
page
9
of
their
reply
brief.
petitioner
there
says
that
we
are
correct
when
we
say,
and
i
quote,
"that
courts
ordinarily
determine
the
meaning
of
legal
documents
such
as
trust
instruments.
"
and
that
is
the
essence
of
what
trust
law
says.
it
says
that
if...
it
says
that
it's
for
a
court
to
decide
in
the
first
instance
whether
a
trust
instrument
confers
on
a
trustee
a
mandatory
power,
that
is
to
say
a
power
the
trustee
has
to
exercise,
a
duty,
or
whether
the
instrument
confers
on
the
trustee
a
discretionary
power.
and
if
it...
if
the
court
concludes
that
the
instrument
confers
a
mandatory
power,
the
court
will
then
mandate
the
trustee
to
act.
professor--
mr.
david
silberman
--i
believe
that--
mr.
david
silberman
--that,
that's
precisely
right,
and
professor
scott
in
his
treatise
lays
out
cases
in
which,
for
example,
the
trust
says
that
you
should
pay
benefits
when
somebody
is
discharged
from
bankruptcy.
and
the
court
decides
whether
that
fact
has,
in
fact,
occurred.
mr.
david
silberman
i
take
it
not
there
is
no
case
that's
just
as
good.
so
that
we
think
that
if
trust
law
applies
here,
the
court
of
appeals
was
quite
right
in
saying
that
given
that
what
we
have
here
is,
as
justice
white
developed
at
the
very
outset,
a
pure
question
of
plan
interpretation.
what
does
the
word
"reduction
in
force"
in
this
document
mean?
that...
that's
a
question
for
the
court
to
decide
and
not
a
question
where
the
trust...
the
trustee
or
fiduciary
prevails
so
long
as
he
has
offered
a
rational
answer
to
that
question.
but
if
we're
wrong
about
that,
and
if
trust
law
is
something
other
than
what
we
understand
it
to
be,
we
think
in
any
event
this
statute
does
not
require
the
court
to
apply
a
rule
of
deference
if
that
would
be
what
trust
law
would
answer.
and
we
think
that
three
considerations
lead
us
to
that
conclusion.
first,
it's
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
this
is
not
a
claim
for
breach
of
trust.
this
is
not
a
trust
law
claim.
erisa
does
contain
causes
of
action
for
breach
of
trust
like
the
cause
of
action
this
court,
court
had
before
it
in
the
russell
case.
that
wasn't
the
claim
we
pled,
that
we
brought.
erisa
has
a
separate
cause
of
action
to
enforce
the
terms
of
the
trust.
that's
section
502(a)(1)(b),
which
is
set
out
as
appendix
to
our
brief,
and
what
it
says
is
that
a...
creates
a
cause
of
action
to
"enforce"...
i'm
sorry.
why
don't
we
just
read
it?
"to
recover
benefits
due
under
the
terms
of
the
plan
or
to
enforce
rights
under
the
terms
of
the
plan
or
to
clarify
rights
to
future
benefits
under
the
terms
of
the
plan.
"
that's
the
cause
of
action
that
we
pled
here.
it's
the
cause
of
action
that
the
legislative
history
analogizes
to
a
301
taft
hartley
suit
and
instructs
the
court
to
develop
a
federal
common
law,
much
as
the
court
has
developed
a
federal
common
law
of
labor
contracts.
and
it's
the
cause
of
action
that
this
court
carefully
distinguished
in
the
russell
case.
in
russell,
the
court
said
we're
not
going
to
give
you
in
a
breach
of
trust
suit...
we're
not
going
to
give
you
individual
relief,
compensatory
relief.
your
remedy
is
to
bring
a
suit
under
the
terms
of
the
plan,
and
if
you
bring
a
suit
under
the
terms
of
the
plan,
then
in
russell's
words,
you
can
have
"the
merits
of
your
application
determined.
"
or
at
another
place
in
the
opinion
the
court
says
you
can
get
a
declaratory
judgment
as
to
whether
you
are
"entitled
to
benefits
under
the
provisions
of
the
plan
contract.
"
so,
the,
the
claim
we're
bringing
here
under
this
statute
is
a...
more
of
a
contractual
claim
than
a
trust
law
claim,
and
we
don't
think
that
the
court
in
developing
the
federal
common
law
is
in
any
sense
obligated
to
turn
to
trust
law
rather
than
to
contract
law
to
decide
this
issue.
now,
the
second
reason
why
we
think
trust
law
shouldn't
apply
here
is
that
trust
law
simply
doesn't
speak
to
the
question
that's
posed
in
this
case.
trust
law
speaks
to
trusts.
it
defines
the
rights,
the
responsibilities,
the
roles
of
the
court
in
supervising
a
particular
kind
of
fiduciary,
a
trustee
who
holds
property
for
the
benefit
of
another.
mr.
david
silberman
justice
o'connor,
as
we
understand
trust
law,
we
think
that
if
this
were
a
funded
plan
with
independent
trustees,
the
argument
for
applying
trust
law
would
be
a
far
stronger
argument.
mr.
david
silberman
that's--
mr.
david
silberman
--that's
certainly--
mr.
david
silberman
--that's
absolutely
correct
as
to
the
result
and
as
to
this
category
of
question,
a
plan
interpretation
question.
it
may
be
that
in
some
other
case
which
involves
a
different
kind
of
question,
perhaps
a
fact
question,
the
answer
would
differ
if
you
were
applying
trust
law
than
if
you
were
applying
contract
type
law.
mr.
david
silberman
no.
i,
i
perhaps
mis-spoke,
justice
scalia.
i'm
saying...
i
want
to
be
saying
two
things:
first,
that
if
it's
a
cause
of
action
to
enforce
the
fiduciary
duties
of
erisa,
as
opposed
to
enforce
the
terms
of
a
particular
plan,
then
clearly
those
fiduciary
duties
were
derived
from
trust
law
and
need
to
be
interpreted
in
light
of
trust
law.
so,
that's
point
one.
mr.
david
silberman
that's
right
if
it's
a
cause
of
action
to
enforce
any
of
these
statutory
trust-like
duties.
i'm
saying
that
if
it's
a
action
to
enforce
the
terms
of
the
plan,
a
502(a)(1)(b)
action,
that
the
court
is
not
bound
to
adopt
trust
law,
but
it
can
look
to
other
sources,
and
that
if
there
were
a
trust
law
rule
that
said
in
this
kind
of
case
that
we
defer
to
what
the
trustee
does,
that
rule
should
not
be
borrowed
here.
mr.
david
silberman
that--
mr.
david
silberman
--putting
aside
whether
i'd
be
just
as
happy
because
i...
i
mean,
i
don't...
as
a
matter
of--
[laughter]
it
seems
to
me
analytically
that's
not
the
way
i
think
is
the
fair
way
of
reasoning
this
through
that
trust
law
does
govern
in
its
own
terms.
i
think
the
fairer
way
of
reasoning
it
is
that
this
is
more
of
a
contract
question.
but
certainly
my
clients
would
be
just
as
happy--
--by
the
decision
you
just
proposed.
but
it
does
seem
to
us,
as
we
say,
that
we
don't
think
the
court
is
bound
by...
to
develop
to
apply
trust
law
in
part
because
of
the
nature
of
this
cause
of
action,
in
part
because
trust
law
does
not
speak
to
this
kind
of
situation
at
all,
to
the
situation
where
you
don't
have
a
trustee
and
you
don't
have
a
trust
corpus,
and
you're
not
making
decisions
allocating
money
between
a
group
of
beneficiaries.
and
finally,
we
think
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
borrow
the
hypothesized
trust
law
rule
of
deference
because
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
statutory
policies
of--
mr.
david
silberman
--well,
it's
only
significant,
just...
justice
stevens,
insofar
as
an
argument
is
being
made
here
that
you
should
borrow
trust
law,
that
yes,
of
course,
there
are
lots
of
fiduciaries.
an
attorney
is
a...
has
a...
is
in
a
fiduciary
relationship
with
the--
mr.
david
silberman
--well,
i...
i'm
not--
mr.
david
silberman
--our
submission...
or
one
of
the
considerations
that
we're
urging
is
that
the
rules
that
the
trust...
trust
law
chancery
courts
developed
as
to
what
the
role
of
the
courts
would
be
in
policing
trustees
were
not
rules
developed
about
fiduciaries
at
large,
they
were
rules
developed
about
this
developed
about
this
particular
kind
of
fiduciary
because
of
his
particular
relationship
and
because,
as
the
court
said
in
the
mine
workers
v.
robinson
case,
that
what
a
trustee
often
is
called
upon
to
do
is
to
allocate
a
finite
sum
among
competing
beneficiaries.
so,
the
trust
law's
rules
of
deference
start
from
the
premise
that
we're,
we're
dealing
with
allocative
decisions
among
a
defined
group
of
beneficiaries.
and
they
just
don't
speak
to
this
situation
here
where
what's
at
issue
is
whether
money
stays
in
firestone's
pocket
or
comes
to
the
plaintiff's
pocket.
mr.
david
silberman
well,
it's
actually...
i
think
it's
actually...
trustee
is
more
the
term
of
art
in
trust
law
than
fiduciary,
justice...
chief
justice
rehnquist.
but,
yes,
it
does.
and
we're
not...
certainly
the
statute...
it's
clear
that
this
statute
was
intended
to
impose
fiduciary
duties
as
those
duties
were
developed
in
the
law
of
trusts
on
this
type
of
fiduciary.
that's
what
section
404
is
all
about.
and
as
i
said
to
justice
scalia,
we
certainly
agree
that
those
duties,
those
fiduciary
duties,
should
be
developed
and
interpreted
in
light
of
the
body
of
trust
law
that
defines
those
duties.
what
we're
saying
is
that
this
statute
also
creates
a
separate
cause
of
action
to
enforce
a
plan,
that
that--
mr.
david
silberman
--i
think
that's
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
david
silberman
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
david
silberman
that's
correct.
mr.
david
silberman
well,
no,
because
the
third
point
i
was
getting--
mr.
david
silberman
--well--
mr.
david
silberman
--no.
i
think
the
third...
as
i
say,
it
seems
to
us
there
are
three
considerations
which
taken
together
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
if
trust
law
were
against
us,
it
wouldn't
apply
here,
the
third
of
which
is
the
policies
of
erisa
which
is
i
think
what
the
court
of
appeals
was
focusing
on.
i
would
say
that
i
wouldn't
put
my...
all
of
my
dollars
on
the
policies
of
erisa,
which
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
did.
to
that
extent,
i
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals,
but--
mr.
david
silberman
--i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
i
believe
not,
but
i
wouldn't...
i
wouldn't...
i
was
not
counsel
for,
for
the
plaintiffs
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
david
silberman
i'll
be
happy
to
do
it
now,
justice--
mr.
david
silberman
--sure.
mr.
david
silberman
and
there's
the
white
light.
that
the
policies
of
erisa
militate
against
adopting
any
rule
which
says
that
in
an
unfunded
situation,
where
you
have
the
kind
of
conflict
of
interest
you
have
here,
that
as...
that
as
long
as
the
employer
has
given
a
rational
interpretation
of
the
plan,
the
employer's
interpretation
prevails.
mr.
david
silberman
let
me
then
turn
to
this--
mr.
david
silberman
--i...
i
think
that
the
plaintiffs
here
would
be
entitled
to
prevail
under
that
rule.
i...
that's
not
the
rule
we
are
urging
here.
we're
urging
the
rule
that
the
labor
department
adopted
contemporaneously
with
the
statute
that
so
long
as
you
are
making
a
claim,
you
are
a
participant
for
purpose
of
this
statute.
as
we--
mr.
david
silberman
--well,
the
statute
defines
participant
as
someone
who
is
or
may
become
eligible
for
benefits.
what
we've
said...
and
i,
i--
mr.
david
silberman
--well,
i...
it
seems
to
me,
justice
scalia,
that
the
statute
is...
perhaps
the
words,
the
words
point
against
us,
but
it's
susceptible
of
being
read
to
encompass
at
least
the
colorable
claim
situation.
and
on
reflection,
i
think
justice
o'connor's
point
is
telling,
that
if
this
is
somebody
who's
a
stranger
to
the
plan
and
comes
in
and
says
i
want
some
information
or
i
want
you
to
review
my,
my
denial,
that...
that
the...
it
would
be
okay
for
the
trustees
to
say
who
are
you.
we
don't
have
any
obligation
to
you.
but
if
you're
at
least
dealing
with
a
colorable
claim,
it
seems
to
me
the
statute
is
susceptible
of
being
read
to
cover
somebody
who
asserts
a
colorable
claim.
that's
number
one.
two,
the
statute
makes
better
sense
as
a
whole...
it
works
better...
if
you
define
it
in
those
terms
because
if
you
don't
define
it
in
those
terms,
then
to
go
back
to
the
claims
procedure
that
mr.
wald
spoke
about
which
says
you
have
to
give
the
review
to
people
who
are
participants,
that
means
that
as
long
as
you're
right
on
the
merits,
you
wouldn't
have
to
have
any
review,
and
there
wouldn't
be
any
violation.
clearly,
that's
not
what
congress
meant.
clearly,
they
had
some
notion
here
that
you're
going
to
give
review
not
just
to
people
who
actually
are
entitled
to
benefits,
but
to
some
broader
class.
mr.
david
silberman
xxx.
mr.
david
silberman
i
mean,
i
think
as
a
practical
matter,
that's
right
in
information
sense.
in
the
claims
procedure,
however,
it's
not
simply
that
there
wouldn't
be
damages,
that
there
wouldn't
be
any
duty,
that
the
employer
would
be
the...
the
statute
would
mean
that
you
have
to
have
a
claims
procedure
for
those
who
are
entitled
to
prevail,
but
not
for
other
people.
similar,
the
section
which
sets
out
fiduciary
obligations,
which
say
you
owe
an
exclusive
duty
to
participants,
would
mean
you
only
owe
a
duty
to
those
who
you
write...
who
you
decide
are
participants,
not
to
the
people
who
are
within
the
class
who
may
or
may
not
be.
so,
i
think
the
statute
doesn't
work
all
that
well.
i
think
it's
terribly
important
that
the
labor
department,
which
is
charged
with
enforcing
the
statute,
contemporaneously
came
to
the
view
we
urge
in
its
regulations
and
said
precisely
what
we
urge
here.
and
finally,
i
think
it's
quite
significant
that
the
legislative
history...
that
the
legislative
history
points
in
the
same
direction.
and
i
want
to...
because
it's
not
in
our
brief,
but
it's
in
an
amicus
brief
of
the
pension
rights
center...
point
out
to
the
court
that
when
this
statute
was
being
considered,
the
senate
finance
committee's
bill,
which
was
incorporated
with
the
labor
committee's
bill
to
create
the
ultimate
act...
the
senate
finance
committee's
report
on
its
bill
said
that
a
plan
beneficiary
is
an
individual
who
is
receiving
or
claims
a
right
to
receive
benefits
under
a
qualified
plan.
and
the
language
that
the
senate
finance
committee
was
referring
to
was
precisely
the
language
that
was
enacted
in
the
statute.
it
was
section
501(g)(5)
of
the
s.
1179,
and
it's
now
the
definition
of
beneficiary.
so,
we
think
that
the
combination
of
the
structure
of
the
contemporaneous
interpretation
of
the
legislative
history
lead
to
at
least
the
conclusion
that
justice
o'connor
states
on
the
second
issue.
thank
you.
