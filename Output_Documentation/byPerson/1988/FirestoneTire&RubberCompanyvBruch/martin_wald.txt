mr.
martin
wald
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
questions
presented
in
this
case
are
answered
by
the
language
and
the
legislative
history
of
erisa
and
its
predecessor
statutes.
the
statutes
makes
clear
two
things.
one,
a
court
reviewing
an
erisa
plan
fiduciary's
denial
of
benefits
should
defer
to
the
fiduciary's
decision
absent
an
abuse
of
discretion
by
the
fiduciary.
two,
a
plan
administrator
should
not
be
subject
to
personal
liability
for
damages
for
failing
to
furnish
documents
to
former
employees
who
were
not
eligible
for
benefits
and
could
not
become
eligible
for
benefits.
neither
the
third
circuit
nor
respondents
are
free
to
create
new
policies
contrary
to
the
intent
of
congress
as
evidenced
in
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history.
the
court...
the
case
arose
after
firestone
sold
its
plastic
division
to
a
subsidiary
of
occidental
petroleum
requiring
occidental
to
retain
in
its
employ
all
of
the
employees
in
their
same
jobs
at
their
same
wages.
they
did
not
lose
a
day
of
work.
firestone
then
determined
that
these
employees
were
not
entitled
to
reduction
in
force
or
what
we
call
rif
termination
pay,
and
did
not
make
that
payment.
the
first
question
presented
to
this
court
is
who
should
make
this
decision.
congress
said
in
erisa
the
plan
fiduciary
should
make
this
decision.
the
third
circuit
by
de
novo
review
opted
for
the
courts.
mr.
martin
wald
well,
the
fiduciary,
of
course,
the
administrator,
determines
the
plan
initially.
mr.
martin
wald
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
there
should
be
de
novo
review
of
that
decision.
mr.
martin
wald
yes.
there
are
many
things
in
writing.
it's
a
searching
review.
there
were--
mr.
martin
wald
--it
was
in
writing.
mr.
martin
wald
it
does.
mr.
martin
wald
it's
construction
of
a
written
instrument
because
congress
in
the
statute
said
these
documents,
whether
it's
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
or
any
other
kind
of
document,
should
be
treated
as
a
trust
instrument.
the
court
should
review--
mr.
martin
wald
--yes,
they
are.
they're
given
it
under
trust
law
and
they're
given
it
expressly
by
the
statute
in
section
402
and
503.
so,
congress
has
given
it
to
them,
and
common
law
trust
law,
which
congress
indicated
should
apply,
has
given
to--
mr.
martin
wald
--yes,
it
does
in
this
respect.
it
gives
them
the,
the
the
power
to
determine
who's
entitled
to
benefits
in
two
ways.
in
section
402
it
says
the
fiduciary
shall
have
the
control,
management,
operation
and
administration
of
the
plan,
and
in
section
503
it
says
the
fiduciary
shall
decide
claims
of
employees.
so,
it's
clear
that
discretion
is
given
to
the
fiduciary.
mr.
martin
wald
under
common
law
trust
law,
i
think
that's
true.
mr.
martin
wald
well,
i
think
trust
law
would
say
that
the
court
would
look
at
it.
i
agree
with
you,
justice
scalia,
to
that
extent.
but
the
courts
will
say
under
trust
law
that
they
will
apply
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard--
mr.
martin
wald
--not
to
decide
it
de
novo.
mr.
martin
wald
i
think
that's
crystal
clear
under
trust
law.
mr.
martin
wald
well,
they
have
to
make...
they
have
that
discretion
to
the
extent
they...
they
have
to
interpret
the
trust
agreement,
and
i
think
bogert,
scott
in
their
restatement
and
the
cases
all
indicate
that
the
trustee
has
the
job
of
interpreting
the
agreement.
and
his
interpretation
will
not
be
upset
unless
there
has
been
an
abuse
of...
an
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
martin
wald
well,
i
think
that
might
be,
with
all
due
respect,
an
oversimplification.
there
is
under
the--
mr.
martin
wald
--under
the
abuse
of
discretion
standard
a
searching
review
of
the
trustee's
decision,
and
if
there's
any
indication
that
he
acted
out
of
an
improper
motive
or
in
any
way
abused
his
discretion,
then
the
court
is
free
to
set
it
aside.
in
this
case
there
were
two
years
of
discovery,
thousands
of
pages
of
production
of
documents,
numerous
depositions
and
interrogatories,
and
there
was
no
evidence
that
there
was
any
improper
motive
acted
out
of
and...
or
any
abuse
of
discretion
whatsoever.
mr.
martin
wald
and
that's...
of
course,
central
states
talks
about
who
the
trustees
having
determination
to
determine
who
a
participant
is.
and
i
think
it's,
it's...
trust
law
holds
that
the
trustee
determines
who
are
beneficiaries
in
interpreting
the
plan.
that's
part...
part
of
his...
part
of
his
job.
mr.
martin
wald
i
think
congress
mandated
that.
they
gave
the...
they
gave
the
trustee
discretion
in
402
and
503,
for
example.
i
think
congress
made
that
decision.
they
define
fiduciary
as
a
person
who
exercises
discretion.
five
on
three
is
a
claims
procedure.
it
clearly
indicates
that
the
fiduciary
is
to
resolve
claims.
mr.
martin
wald
well,
let
me
see
it
this
answer
is
responsive,
justice
o'connor.
congress
drew
no
distinction
in
regard
to
the
fiduciary
provisions
between
funded
and
unfunded
plans.
mr.
martin
wald
i,
i
think
if
my...
it
my--
mr.
martin
wald
--if
i
understand
the
position
of
the
respondents
and
their
amici,
they
are
all
over
the
lot
about
where
the
abuse
of
discretion
standard
applies
or
doesn't
apply,
what
its
limits
are.
i
don't
think
they're
consistent.
so,
i
can't
really
tell
you
where
they
stand
on
their
position.
i
can
tell
you
that
we
hold
that
the
abuse
of
discretion
stands.
mr.
martin
wald
denial
benefits
the
trustee.
and
that
is
specifically
contemplated
by
congress.
congress
was
well
aware
that
most
of
the
plans
were
employer-administered.
and
they
dealt
with
this
in
section
408(c)(3),
which
expressly
allows
a
fiduciary
to
be
exempt
from
the
prohibited
transaction,
and
conflict
of
interest
standards
in
section
406,
expressly
states
that
a
fiduciary
can
act
as
a
fiduciary...
his
agent,
agents,
employees
can
act
as
a
fiduciary...
even
though
there
is
a
potential
conflict
of
interest.
so,
congress
has
contemplated
this
and
reached
a
decision
on
this.
respondents
and
their
amici--
mr.
martin
wald
--well,
i
think
congress
adopted
a
standard
of
review
to
the
extent
that
they,
they
did
several
things.
they,
they
incorporated
the
sole
benefit
language
from
302
in
the
labor
management
relations
act,
which
was
a
predecessor
statute
here.
they
established
fiduciary
standards
which
carry
with
them
an
abuse
of
discretion
review,
and
i,
i
think
they
indicated...
again,
we
get
back
to
this
trust
law
applying.
they
indicated
the
scope
of
review.
now,
in
regard
to
the
common
law
argument,
the
common
law
rule
under
textile
mills
and
section
301
and
subsequent
cases
is
that
congress
looks
first
at
the
statute,
second
at
the
legislative
history,
and
only
lastly
at
public
policy.
in
addition,
under
textile
mill...
lincoln
mills
and
section
301,
congress
did
not
displace
the
statutory
indications
of
the
law
to
apply,
namely
contract
law
under
301
and
trust
law
under
302.
but
respondents
and
their
amici
are
asking
this
court
to
displace
trust
law
and
substitute
something
new.
i
don't
know
what
it
would
be
called.
de
novo
review.
but
de
novo
review
of
a
trustee's
decision
on
a
discretionary
matter--
mr.
martin
wald
--oh,
it
would
tell
them
that's
perfectly
okay
as
long
as
the
trustee
doesn't
act
out
of
the...
out
of
the
conflict
of
interest.
that's
clear.
that's
clear
in
trust
law.
in
addition,
congress
has
recognized,
as
i
have
indicated,
that
there
was
a
conflict
of
interest,
and
they
sanctioned
it.
moreover,
trust
law
says...
if
the
settler
when
they
set
up
the
plan
or
trust
was
aware
that
there
was
a
conflict
of
interest,
trust
law
says
nothing
wrong
with
the
trustee
handling
that
and
administering
it
and
controlling
it
and
managing
it
and
making
a
discretionary
decisions.
the
limit
is
that
is
cannot
act
out
of
an
improper
motive
or
in
his
own
interest.
in
other
words,
the
limit
is
that
he
cannot
abuse
his
discretion.
congress,
it
should
be
kept
in
mind,
has
regulated
employee
benefit
plans
under
trust
principles
since
1947
and
incorporated
trust
principles
into
erisa.
congress
was
well
aware
of
the
scope
of
review
under
section
302
that
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
of
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard.
they
did
not
change
that.
in
fact,
to
the
contrary.
in
the
legislative
history
and
the
statute
itself,
they
incorporate,
incorporate
references
to
302.
it's
cited
by
number
in
the
coverage
provision
of
the
statute,
and
they
lift,
lift
from
302
the
sole
benefit
of
the
beneficiaries
language
and
put
it
directly
into
the
fiduciary
provisions
of
erisa.
and,
of
course,
that...
that
is
the
common
law
rule
of
trusts,
that
the
fiduciary
must
act
for
the
sole
benefit
of
the
beneficiaries.
congress
said
that.
this
fiduciary
acted
under
those
rules,
and
congress
has
made
that
decision
that
that
gave
complete
protection
to
the
beneficiaries.
and,
in
fact,
that's
the
highest
obligation
known
to
the
law,
the
obligation
of
a
trustee.
it's
much
higher
than
the
obligation
of
a
contracting
party
who,
of
course,
can
act
in
a
hostile
and
no-holds-barred
way
against
a
claimant.
mr.
martin
wald
well,
there
is
specific
reference
in
the
legislative
the
history
that
indicates
that
80
percent
of
the
pension
plans
were
administered...
employer-administered.
only
20
percent
were
jointly
administered.
and
that's
in
the
legislative
history
and
report
given
to
them...
a
statistical
report.
mr.
martin
wald
i'm
trying
to--
mr.
martin
wald
--i'm
trying
to
say...
well,
i
would...
i
would
guess
it's...
it's
60,
70,
80
percent,
something
like
that.
mr.
martin
wald
yes,
yes.
the
minority
is
the
funded,
jointly
administered
plan
particularly
in
regard
to
health
and
welfare
which
severance
is
one,
one,
one
of
the
type.
yes.
the
exception
is
the
jointly
administered
or
the
funded.
now,
to
the
extent
that
policy
considerations
are
relevant,
these
also
support
reversal
of
the
third
circuit's
decision.
erisa
protects
the
interest
of
participants
in
employee
benefit
plan,
but
it
balances
that
with
the
sponsor's
"interest
in
maintaining
flexibility
in
the
design
and
operation.
"
of
their
plans.
congress
regulated
minutely
funding,
vesting,
insurance
and
other
aspects
of
employee
benefit
plans,
but
they
left
the
day-to
day
administration
to
the
fiduciary.
they
decided
that
was
the
best
way
to
help
employees.
now,
it
may
not
help
employees
in
every
individual
case.
congress
was
saying
what
would
help
employee
across
the...
across
the
country
as
a
whole,
and
they
decided,
among
other
things,
that
it
was
very
important
to
help
employees
by
doing
nothing
that
would
discourage
the
formation
or
expansion
of
employee
benefit
plans.
so,
they
did
a
balancing
in
making
sure
that
the
burdens
were
not
so
heavy
as
to
hurt
rather
than
help
employees.
they
did
not
want
to
have
unintended
consequences
adverse
to
employees.
mr.
martin
wald
right.
mr.
martin
wald
statute
does
that,
section
402.
mr.
martin
wald
it
says
that
the
administrator
or
fiduciary
shall
have
the
control,
management
in
the
operation
and
administration
of
the
plan,
and
that
certainly
includes
deciding
who
is
entitled
to
benefits.
mr.
martin
wald
it
also--
mr.
martin
wald
--well--
mr.
martin
wald
--i
think
it's
there.
i
also
think
it's
in
503,
where
there
is
a
claims
procedure
that
says
an
employee
can
file
a
claim
and
that
that
claim
ultimately
will
be
decided
by
the
fiduciary/administrator.
so,
that's
a
second
place.
mr.
martin
wald
well,
when
congress...
i
think
the...
cases
cited
in
our
briefs
that
indicate
that
when
congress
confers
a
power
to
a
person
outside
the
courts,
the
cases
hold
that
congress
is
also
implicitly
saying
that
the
congress
should
defer
to
the...
that
private
person's
exercise
of
that
power.
mr.
martin
wald
that's
right.
mr.
martin
wald
i
believe
they're
attached
to
the
briefs,
yes.
mr.
martin
wald
in
the
appendix,
i
believe
so.
i
apologize
if
they're
not
there.
mr.
martin
wald
well,
they're
an
appendix
to
the
petition
for
cert
and--
mr.
martin
wald
--well,
i
apologize
if
they're
not
there.
mr.
martin
wald
to
the
petition
for
cert
yes.
thank
you.
mr.
martin
wald
yes,
very
heavily
on
402.
mr.
martin
wald
i'm
amazed
too
and
embarrassed
if
that's...
if
that's
the
case.
respondents
urge
de
novo
review.
congress
considered
having
arbitration
as
a
means
of
deciding
employee
benefit
disputes.
congress
rejected
arbitration
as
being
too
expensive
and
resulting
in
too
many
frivolous
disputes.
now,
if
arbitration
is
too
expensive
and
too
likely
to
result
in
frivolous
disputes,
that
is
even
more
so
in
regard
to
de
novo
review.
de
novo
review,
of
course,
would
have
discovery
and
the
full
panoply
of
those
procedures...
be
much
more
expensive.
and
we
know
that
because
attorney's
fees
are
granted
in
this
statute,
that
it's
such
more
likely
to
result
in
the
filing
of
frivolous
cases.
it
will
also
result
in
a
great
nonuniformity
among
the
various
courts
in
deciding
these
cases.
and,
of
course,
congress
wanted
to
get
consistency
on
a
national
basis
because
so
many
of
these
plans
exist
on
a
national
basis.
and
query--
mr.
martin
wald
--no,
i
think
that's
nonuniformity
because...
take
a
national
plan.
you
have
a
central
focus
point,
the
administrator
for
that
national
plan.
and
that
will
be
a
focus
through
which
all
the
plans
pass,
but
if
you
de
novo
review,
you
have
one
decision
in
maine
and
another
in
florida.
so,
there's
such
more
nonuniformity.
now,
query.
if
you
have
de
novo
review
and
you
have
contractual
analysis,
will
you...
will
we
also
have
jury
trials
which,
of
course,
adds
even
more
to
expense
and
to
inconsistent
decisions.
mr.
martin
wald
i
am
now.
the
second
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
firestone
was
required
to
furnish
copies
of
plan
documents
to
employees
of
the
plastics
division
after
the
sale
to
occidental.
firestone
had
already
determined
that
these
employees
were
not
eligible
for
benefits,
and
the
courts
decided
that
having
been
terminated,
they
could
not
become
eligible
for
benefits.
who
is
a
participant
is
an
erisa
plan...
in
an
erisa
plan?
it's
a
defined
term,
"participant".
it
must
be
determined
on
the
statutory
definition
by
reference
to
the
eligibility,
years
of
service,
age,
that
type
of
thing
to
decide
who
may
become
eligible.
so,
we're
talking
about
a
defined
term.
and
i
respectfully
suggest
the
court
of
appeals,
respondents
and
amici
have
said
we
don't
like
the
definition
congress
drew.
so,
we're
suggesting
that
it
should
be
modified.
and
we
disagree
with
that,
of
course.
erisa's
policy
requires
application
of
the
statutory
definition.
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
information
was
to
be
given
only
to
participants,
those
employees
who
were
eligible
or
could
become
eligible
for
benefits.
the
congressional
intent,
as
already
mentioned,
was
not
to
overburden
plans.
disclosure,
particularly
automatic
disclosure,
is
very
expensive
and
burdensome.
and
in
[inaudible]...
in
the--
mr.
martin
wald
--the
photocopy
costs.
not
the
storage
or
the
retrieval.
mr.
martin
wald
and
there
are
other...
and
that--
mr.
martin
wald
--well,
modest.
but
i
think
the
answer
to
that
or
one
of
the...
there
were
two
answers
to
that.
one,
administrators
out
of
common
good
sense
employee
relations
are
going
to
reply
to
these
requests
affirmatively.
occasionally,
there,
there
may
be
an
administrative
slip-up,
an
honest
mistake,
but
good
business
judgment
will
cause
them
to
comply.
also
the
risk
to
the
administrator
is
a
fine
of
a
$<one
hundred>
[=
100]
a
day
personal
liability.
so,
this
risk
alone...
it's
much
cheaper
to
answer
the
request
than
to
run
such
a
risk
of
such
an
onerous
burden.
mr.
martin
wald
well,
there's
no--
mr.
martin
wald
--you
know,
there's
no
finding
by
either
court
that
the
information
wasn't
furnished.
in
fact,
a
lot
of
information
was
furnished.
the
discovery
in
the
case...
there
may
have
been
administrative
slip-up
or
an
honest
mistake
in
one
or
two
cases.
but
one
employee,
for
example--
mr.
martin
wald
--well,
the...
the
people
here
had
all
the
information
they
wanted
before
they
filed
the
suit.
they
got
it
all.
they
had
it
before
they
filed
the
suit.
they
had
it.
mr.
martin
wald
well,
that's...
it's
in
the...
it's
in
the
record.
it's
clear,
clear
from
the
record.
there's
no
finding
by
either
court.
no
court
made
a
finding
in
regard
to
what
was
or
wasn't
furnished
because
it
was
decided
on
the
legal--
mr.
martin
wald
--well,
some
courts
have
said
so.
we
don't
think
so,
and
we
don't
think
so
because
it
goes
against
the
clear
statutory
language.
the
language
says
participants
and
defines
the
term,
and
they
don't,
don't,
don't
say
colorable
claim.
so,
we
think
that
judicial
construction
is
in
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
martin
wald
no.
i
think,
as
i
read
the
opinion,
justice
o'connor--
mr.
martin
wald
--that's
the
way
i
read
it.
any
claimant
is
entitled
to
get
it.
they
did
a
faulty
analysis
i
believe
in
terms
of
standing,
which
i
won't
deal
with
because
i
think
we
deal
with
it
in
our
brief,
and
it's
just
poorly
founded...
poorly
finded.
now,
respondents
attempt
to
evade
the
statutory
definition
by
drawing
a
distinction
between
the
term
"participant
covered
under
the
plan"
and
the
term
"participant".
they
contend
a
participant
covered
under
the
plan
gets
automatic
disclosure
which,
of
course,
is
very,
very
expensive,
annual
reports,
periodic
reports,
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
they
say
that
a,
a
participant...
plan
participant
gets
documents
only
on
request.
now,
the
important
thing
on
this
i
think
is
that
the
distinction
doesn't
hold
up
when
you
parse
the
statute.
when
you
go
through
section
104
and
you
see
where
it
says
when
you
make
automatic
disclosure
and
when
you
make
automatic
disclosure
and
request,
the
distinction
between
the
two
versions,
participant
covered
under
the
plan
and
participant,
just
doesn't
stand
up
with
the
parsing
of
the
statute.
i
think
the
bottom
line
on
participant
is
this.
congress
did
not
say
that
claimants
are
entitled
to
information
on
request.
they
could
have
said
that.
they
would
not
have
used
a
circumlocution
of
eligible
to
become.
they
would
have
said
claimants.
the
court
of
appeals,
respondents
and
their
amici
says
the
circumlocution
means
claimants.
i
respectfully
suggest
that
if
congress
had
meant
to
say
claimants,
they
would
have
said
claimants.
thank
you.
i'll
reserve,
if
i
may,
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
martin
wald
well,
i
just...
with
one
minute
i'd
just
like
to
say
that
the
solicitor
general
has
just
talked
about
firestone's
bias.
after
two
years
of
the
full
panoply
of
discovery,
there's
no
indication
whatsoever
that
firestone
had
any
bias.
second
thing
to
be
kept
in
mind
is
that...
statute
makes
clear
that
every
plan
is
a
trust.
and
we
seem
to
be
forgetting
that...
some
of...
of
the
discussion.
congress
made
it
clear.
when
they
adopted
the
references
to
the
labor
management
relations
act,
they
were
aware
of
the
application
of
the
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
they
indicated
that
they
were
satisfied
with
it.
it's
taken
as
a
matter
of
law
that
they
were
aware
of
it.
if
they
had
been
unsatisfied,
they
would
have
given
some
indication.
as
regards
to
the
contract
aspect,
502
says
who
can
sue
for
what.
but
404
says
the
fiduciary
must
give
the
beneficiaries
the
benefits
entitled
to
them
under
the
plan.
so,
the
fiduciary--
mr.
martin
wald
--thank
you.
