justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
sure,
if
you've
got
those
options.
but
is
there
any
duty
to
do
anything?
that's
the
question.
here
it
did
find
arguable
issues,
and
then
having
found
that
there
were
arguable
issues,
did
it
have
any
duty
to
appoint
counsel
to
argue
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they'd
been
decided
in
a
manner
that
did
not
let
this
litigant
have
a
lawyer
argue
his
view
of
those
issues.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
question
is
whether
he
was
entitled
to
have
that
done
for
him.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
is
the
circumstance
that
justifies
that
result?
the
fact
that
somebody
else
argued
them
for
some
other
client?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
you
say
"duty",
then
why
didn't
it...
then
it
violated
that
duty.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
had
been
decided
in
a
case
to
which
this
litigant
was
not
a
party,
in
which
he
didn't
have
a
lawyer
arguing
his
view
of
those
issues.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
could
you
then
say
that
in
a
joint
trial
like
this,
you
don't
need
to
appoint
lawyers
for
all
three
of
them,
because
they're
basically
the
same?
or
just
appoint
one
for
one
of
the
three?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what's
wrong
with
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
wouldn't
that
rule
apply
to
that
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
why
don't
you
have
an
equal
protection
problem
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
two
of
them
got
lawyers,
and
one
did
not,
and
they're
similarly
situated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
can
argue
here
but
if
you
have
absolute
inequality,
of
three
people,
exactly
the
same
position,
you
give
a
lawyer
to
two
and
not
to
the
third,
and
there's
no
inequality
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
at
the
time
the
court
ruled
on
the
motion
to
withdraw,
it
had
considered
the
briefs
filed
by...
on
behalf
of
the
other
two
defendants?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
so
at
the
time
they
ruled
on
the
motion
to
withdraw,
that...
you
admit
that
was
error?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
preferred?
wasn't
it
rather
clear
that
it
was
error?
i
mean,
you
can
admit
a
few
things,
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
now,
then
they
find
out
later
on
that
there
are
arguable
issues
in
a
case
in
which
the
person
has
never...
the
defendant
has
never
had
an
argument
made
for
him.
do
they
at
that
point
have
a
duty
to
appoint
counsel?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
they've
been
raised
by
somebody
else
representing
other
clients?
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
your
harmless
error
argument,
are
you
arguing
that
we
should
search
the
record
for
harmless
error?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
your
argument,
that
we
should
make
the
harmless
error,
because
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
said
there
was
no
prejudice,
but
they
didn't
say
that
they
could
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
there
was...
that
the
error
was
harmless.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
they...
if
we
should
decide
that,
then
what
do
we
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
how
could
they
have
been
raised
before
the
ohio
appellate
court,
though?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
reason
they
weren't,
i
suppose,
is
he
didn't
have
a
lawyer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
ayers,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
opponent's
suggestion
that
one
possible
disposition
of
this
case
would
be
to
remand
it
to
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
to
decide
whether
there
would
be
error,
assuming
it
was
error...
was
harmless
or
not?
if
we
should
do
that,
would
your
client
be
entitled
to
have
a
lawyer
represent
him
in
the
proceedings
before
the
ohio
court
of
appeals?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
their
disposition
would
give
him
a
lawyer,
as
i
see
it
now.
and
i'm
not
sure
one
would
be
any
more
expensive
than
the
other.
i
don't
know
whether
it
makes
any
difference
whether
we
would
do
that,
and
let
your
client
then
have
a
lawyer
to
argue,
file
a
brief,
or
to
reverse,
since
they
appoint
a
lawyer
on
the
appeal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
another--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
another
question
about
the
practice
in
ohio
in
appointed
cases?
does
the
lawyer
get
paid
so
much
per
case
or
so
much
per
hour
in
a
case
of
this
kind,
the
appointed
counsel?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
much
an
hour.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
he
wouldn't
get
the
same
amount
for
filing
this,
this
anders
letter
as
he
would
if
he'd
filed
a
brief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
well,
of
course,
if
he
spent
the
same
amount
of
time
on
it,
though,
i
suppose
he
would.
if
he
put
in
an
hourly
statement,
showed--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
ohio
court
of
appeals.
it
involves
an
application
of
our
decision
in
anders
against
california,
a
case
we
decided
about
20
years
ago.
petitioner
is
an
indigent.
after
a
jury
convicted
him
of
several
serious
crimes,
counsel
was
appointed
to
represent
him
on
appeal.
the
lawyer,
however,
did
not
file
an
appellate
brief
but
instead
filed
a
motion
seeking
leave
to
withdraw.
although
the
motion
simply
asserted
that
in
reviewing
the
record,
counsel
found
no
reversible
errors
and
although
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
itself
examine
the
record
to
confirm
counsel's
conclusion,
the
court
granted
counsel
leave
to
withdraw.
subsequently,
upon
ultimately
reviewing
the
record
for
error,
the
court
of
appeals
found
several
arguable
claims
that
it
did
not
appoint
a
new
lawyer
to
represent
the
petitioner.
as
more
fully
explained
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
conclude
that
under
our
decision
in
anders,
counsel
should
not
have
been
permitted
to
withdraw
and
that
in
any
event,
after
finding
that
the
record
presented
several
arguable
claims,
the
court
of
appeals
should
certainly
have
appointed
a
new
lawyer
to
represent
the
petitioner.
we
further
hold
that
under
our
relevant
decisions,
the
error
in
this
case
was
neither
harmless
nor
non-prejudicial.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
affirming
petitioner’s
conviction
is
therefore
reversed
and
the
case
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
justice
o’connor
has
filed
a
concurring
statement,
and
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
