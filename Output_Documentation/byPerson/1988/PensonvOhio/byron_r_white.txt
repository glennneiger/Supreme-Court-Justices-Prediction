justice
byron
r.
white
well,
on
that
basis,
you
would
never...
there
would
be
no
obligation
to
appoint
a
lawyer
in
the
first
place.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
there's
a
request
to
appoint
a
counsel,
and
the
court
says,
"well,
we'll
rule
on
that
at
our
leisure.
"
and
they
look
over
the
record,
and
the
only
issues
they
can
see...
possibly
see...
in
the
case
are
issues
that
have
been
decided
in
another
case,
on
the
same
record.
and
they
say,
"well,
you're
just
not
entitled
to
counsel,
and
your
case
is
just
not
any
good.
"
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what's
the
difference
between
that
one
and
this
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
appellant
didn't
have
the
opportunity
to
have
counsel.
the
counsel
walked
out
on
him,
on
arguable
issues.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
he
had
no...
after
that
he
had
no
representation
in
the
appellate
court
on
deciding
the
issues,
did
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you're...
what
the
argument
really
boils
down
to
is
that,
is
that...
well,
you
can't
really
tell
whether
a
lawyer
done
him
any
good,
because
you
never
can
tell
whether
a
lawyer
would
do
anything...
any
good...
in
which
event,
why
ever
appoint
a
lawyer?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
anders
was
an
equal
protection
case,
or
does
it
rest
on
the
right
to
counsel,
if
there
was
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
real
issue
then
could
never
be
harmless
error,
in
this
case,
could
it?
it
should
be,
just
as
justice
scalia
suggested,
it
just
don't...
no
error
at
all,
no
denial
of
equal
protection.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
it's
an
equal
protection
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
not
an
equal
protection
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
not
an
equal
protection
inquiry,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
were
these
issues
decided
in
a
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
we
have
any
jurisdiction
to
consider
those
questions?
this
is
from
a
state
court,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
should
an
appellate
court
do,
if
midway
through
an
appeal,
it's
perfectly
obvious
that
the
counsel
they
appointed
is
a,
is
a,
if
he
isn't
a
nitwit,
he's
pretty
close
to
it,
and
there's
just
not
going
to
be
any
effective
assistance?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
didn't
they
here
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
lawyer
really
didn't,
didn't
do
what
he
was
supposed
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
do
you
think
the...
do
you
think
that
our
decisions,
the
court's
decisions
have
now
clearly
come
out
to
require
counsel
on
appeal,
not
as
a
matter
of
equal
protection,
but
as
a
matter
of
some
other
provision
in
the
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
not
a
matter
of
due
process?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
the
equal
protection
clause?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
certainly
wouldn't
be
here
if
you
would
have
won,
would
you,
counsel?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
do
you
know
you
wouldn't
be
here
if...
if--
justice
byron
r.
white
--if
counsel
has
been
appointed
and
you
are?
