mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
steven
penson
was
denied
his
right
to
counsel
on
his
direct
appeal
in
the
ohio
court
of
appeals.
we
would
submit
the
facts
of
this
case
clearly
demonstrate
that
mr.
penson's
lawyer
deserted
him
with
the
permission
of
the
court
in
a
case
that
presented
arguable
issues.
i'd
first
like
to
give
the
court
some
of
the
factual
background
of
the
case,
and
then
get
into
our
legal
contentions.
mr.
penson
was
tried,
along
with
two
co-defendants,
for
a
number
of
criminal
charges.
after
he
was
convicted,
all
three,
because
they
were
indigent,
were
appointed
counsel.
the
two
co-defendants'
appellate
lawyers
filed
briefs
on
their
behalf.
mr.
penson's
lawyer
did
not
file
a
brief.
instead,
mr.
penson's
lawyer
filed
a
one
statement
certificate
with
the
court
stating
that
there
were
no
errors
requiring
reversal,
modification,
or
vacation
of
his
sentence.
he
further
indicated
that
he
would
not
file
a
meritless
appeal,
and
he
moved
to
withdraw
as
counsel.
a
week
later,
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
granted
his
motion
without
reviewing
the
record
or
without
requiring
a
brief
from
him.
the
court
subsequently
refused
to
appoint
counsel
for
mr.
penson
upon
his
request,
and
then,
several
months
later,
proceeded
to
decide
the
appeal.
the
court,
in
its
decision,
expressly
disagreed
with
counsel
as
to
whether
there
were
reversible
errors
in
the
case.
in
fact,
the
court
found
one
reversible
error,
and
reversed
one
of
the
counts
on
the
indictment.
the
court
further
found
that
there
were
several
arguable
errors
as
presented
in
the
briefs
of
the
co-defendants.
but
instead
of
appointing
counsel,
as
we
submit
the
court
was
required
to
do,
the
court
determined
that
its
own
error
in
not
appointing
counsel
was
not
prejudicial
to
mr.
penson,
because
it
had
examined
the
record
and
the
errors
submitted
by
the
co-defendants
in
their
briefs.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
well--
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
--well--
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
--well,
i
agree
with
you,
justice
scalia.
the
court
did
give
the,
the
defendant,
mr.
penson,
the
benefit
of
one
of
the
issues
raised
by
one
of
the
co-defendants,
and
that
was
the
count
that
was
reversed.
where
the
court
denied
mr.
penson
his
appellate
right
to
counsel
in
this
situation
was
where
the
court
found
arguable
issues
that
this
court
has
held
in...
repeatedly,
in
a
number
of
cases,
that
the
court
in
that
situation
must
appoint
counsel.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
well,
that
is
precisely
the
relief
that
we
are
asking.
mr.
penson
has
never
had
a
lawyer
to
argue
the
appeals
in
his
case.
we
have
pointed
out
in
the
reply
brief
a
number
of
issues
that
were
not
raised
by
co-defendants'
counsel.
mr.
penson
has
not
had
a
lawyer
to
review
the
case
from
the
perspective
of
his
position
in
the
case.
the
co-defendants'
lawyers
were
reviewing
the
case
from
the
perspective
of
the
co-defendants.
they
were
review...
he
was...
they
were
reviewing
issues
relating
to
the
co-defendants.
they
were
not
advocating
on
behalf
of
mr.
penson,
and
it's
a
different
kind
of
a
representation.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
we
submit
that
where
counsel
was
denied,
this
court
has
never
applied
a
harmless
error
standard.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
well,
counsel
was
effectively
absent,
your
honor.
i
think
the
precedents
of
this
court
indicate
that
when
nominal
counsel
is
not
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
constitution,
the
counsel
must
engage
the
adversary
process.
he
must
provide
some
assistance.
counsel
was
effectively
absent
in
this
case.
he
did
not
assist
in
any
way.
he
did
not
file
a
brief,
he
didn't
do
anything.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
this
is
a...
this
is
now--
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
--the
only--
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
--well--
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
--counsel
did
state
that
he
carefully
reviewed
the
record,
and
that
he
found
no
reversible
errors
in
the
case.
he
did
not
say
the
case
was
frivolous.
he
did
not
file
a
brief,
as
this
court
has--
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
--it
was
exactly...
it
was
exactly
a
no
merit
letter.
it
was
a
one-sentence
statement
saying
there
was
no
merit
to
the
appeal.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
exactly.
he
did
not
present
anything
to
the
court
to
convince
the
court
that
it
was
a
frivolous
appeal,
and
that
is
the
bright
line
test
that
this
court
has
drawn
between
providing
counsel
or
requiring
counsel
and
not
requiring
counsel.
this
court
said
in
anders
that
counsel
must
be
provided
in
a
non-frivolous
appeal
where
there
are
arguable
issues.
in
a
frivolous
appeal,
counsel
can
withdraw.
but
that
is
a
very
narrow
exception,
and
that
is
only
allowed
where
counsel
demonstrates
to
the
court
that
it's
a
non,
that
it's
a
frivolous
case.
but
counsel
in
order
to
do
that
must
present
a
brief
to
the
court
and
must
raise
issues
that
might
arguably
support
the
appeal.
and
then
the
court
has
to
review
the
brief
and
to
make
that
determination
as
to
whether
counsel
is
correct.
neither
of
those
obligations
were
met
by
counsel
in
this
case.
in
fact,
that
court
expressly
disagreed
with
counsel
and
found
arguable
issues.
this
court's
decisions
in
anders
and
subsequently,
this
past
term,
in
mccoy
indicate
that
counsel
must
be
appointed
in
that
situation.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
counsel
was
appointed.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
well,
of
course
in
the
mccoy
case,
the
court
said
that
count...
once
the
court
determines
that
there
are
arguable
issues,
counsel
must
be
appointed
and
must
be
required
to
file
an
anders
brief.
otherwise,
the
right
to
counsel
becomes
illusory.
and
you
can
have
a
defendant
with
arguable
issues
not
getting
his
issues
presented
to
the
court.
i
think
the
bright
line
test
of
anders
is
a
narrow
exception
to
the
douglas
v.
california
right
to
counsel,
and
it
has
to
be
a
narrow
exception,
and
it
has
to
be
strictly
applied
or
the
right
to
counsel
becomes
very
illusory.
and--
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
--that's...
it's...
that's
possible.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
that's
possible.
but
the
court
is
still
required
to
look
at
the
brief,
and
once
it
reviews
the
record,
it
can
make
that
determination
as
to
whether
counsel
has
made
an
adequate
review.
if
it
finds
arguable
issues,
and
finds
that
counsel's
conclusion
that
these
errors
are
frivolous
is
incorrect,
then
counsel...
the
court
at
that
point
is
required
to
appoint
counsel
to
protect
the
right
to
counsel
and
have
those
issues
presented.
that
is
what
anders
requires,
and
i
think
that
the
court
made
that
clear
this
past
term
in
mccoy,
that
once
an
attorney
claims
that
an
appeal
is
frivolous,
that
two
constitutional
concerns
must
be
met.
one
is
that
the
attorney
make
a
diligent
review
of
the
record,
and
the
court
is
satisfied
that
he's
made
a
diligent
review
of
the
record
for
arguable
claims;
and
secondly,
that
his
conclusion
is
correct.
neither
of
those
concerns
were
met
in
this
case.
in
fact,
the
lower
court
found
that
there
were
arguable
issues.
under
anders
and
mccoy,
the
court
was
required
to
appoint
counsel.
it
in
effect
resulted
in
mr.
penson
being
denied
counsel.
he
did
not
have
an
advocate
on
appeal.
and
i
think
douglas
makes
that
very
clear,
that
that
is
not
only
a
denial
of
due
process,
it's
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
in
a
situation
where
you
have
arguable
issues,
a
monied
defendant
can
go
out
and
hire
a
lawyer
and
obtain
the
benefit
of
advocacy
in
a
brief,
and
have
these
issues
presented
to
an
appellate
court.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
i
think
not,
your
honor,
because
once
the
court
gets
his
brief,
then
the
court
is
further
required
to
review
the
record
and
make
sure
that
his
conclusion
is
correct.
once
they
identify
those
issues,
then
the
court
is
required
to
appoint
counsel
at
that
point.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
if
the
court
disagrees--
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
--with
counsel--
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
--if
the
court
disagrees...
i
think
in
most
anders
situations,
the
court
ends
up
relying
upon
counsel
and
accepting
counsel's
representation.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
yes,
i
think
the
court
has
expressly
held
that
in
anders
and
mccoy.
the
court
said
in
mccoy,
to
repeat
myself,
that
if
the
court
determines
that
there
are
arguable
issues
then
the
constitution
requires
that
a
lawyer
be
appointed
to
argue
those
issues.
otherwise,
the
right
to
counsel
can
be
denied
in
a
situation
where
you've
got
non-frivolous
issues,
and
anders
draws
the
line
in
terms
of
the
right
to
counsel
between
frivolous
and
non-frivolous
procedures.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
in
either
the
anders
or
mccoy
situation?
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
in
the--
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
--yeah.
in
the
anders
situation,
the
no
merit
letter
was
filed,
and
the
court
agreed
that
there
was
no
merit
to
the
appeal.
this
court
reversed,
finding
that
the
no
merit
letter
was
not
adequate
to
protect
the
defendant's
right
to
due
process
and
the--
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
--equality
with--
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
--i...
i
think
anders
expressly
says
that.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
yes,
i
believe
it
did
hold
it.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
yes.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
the
court
did
find--
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
--well,
i--
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
--i
understand
what
the
chief
justice
is
driving
at
now.
that
particular
procedure
was
dicta
in
anders.
the
court--
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
--the...
the
issue
in
mccoy
wasn't
precisely
that.
right,
the
issue
in
mccoy
was
whether
or
not
counsel
could
be
required
to
show
why
the
issue
was
frivolous
or
explain
to
the
court
why.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
anders...
our
position
is
that
anders
does
cover
our
situation.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
i'm
not
asking--
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
--i'm
not
asking
the
court
to
extend
it.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
our
position
is
that
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
did
not
comply
with
the
anders
exception.
it
found
expressly
that
there
were
arguable
issues,
and
under
the
anders
decision,
the
court
was
required
to
appoint
counsel.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
that's
expressly
our
position,
and
i
don't
want
the
court
to
misunderstand
that.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
well,
this
court
did
not
apply
a
harmless
error
test
in
anders
or
in
douglas
where
the
court
had
reviewed
the
record
and
made
that
conclusion.
we
would
submit
that
where
there
is
denial
of
counsel,
this
court
has
never
held
that
in
a
harmless
error
test
is
applicable.
this
court
is
automatically
reversed
because
the
right
to
counsel
is
so
fundamental
to
not
only
the
trial
process
but
the
appellate
process
also.
if
counsel
was
not
present
and
participating
in
the
appellate
process
as
an
advocate,
then
the
process
really
hasn't
occurred.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
well,
i
think
that--
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
--i
think
the
problem
with
that,
your
honor,
is
that
it
overly
burdens
the
appellate
court
to
engage
in
speculation
as
to
what
appellate
counsel
has
done.
you've
got
two
different
rights
here...
the
right
to
effective
assistance
at
trial
and
a
right
on
appeal.
you
don't
know
what
counsel
would
have
done
on
appeal.
you
can
review
the
record
to
determine
if
counsel's
performance
at
trial
was
adequate,
but
you
have
to
speculate
as
to
what
counsel
would
have
done
with
that
record.
appellate
courts
are
not
in
good
positions
to
be
advocates
for
defendants.
independent
review
of
the
record
does
not
satisfy
the
advocacy
of
a
lawyer
in
an
appellate
court,
because
the
appellate
court
has
to
speculate
as
to
what
would
have
been
raised,
the
arguments
that
would
have
been
made,
and
how
the
issue
would
have
been
decided.
it
really
makes...
it
really
shifts
the
burden
from
the
lawyer
to
the
court
to
decide
the
case--
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
--and
the
advocacy
process
really
hasn't
worked.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
yes,
precisely.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
we
rely
upon
douglas
as
well
as
anders.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
excuse
me?
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
exactly,
that
a
defendant
on
appeal
benefits
substantially
from
a
lawyer's
presentation
in
a
brief
of
his
examination
of
the
record,
research
of
the
law,
and
marshalling
of
the
arguments
on
his
behalf,
and
that
to
deny
that
benefit
to
an
indigent
violates
the
equal
protection
clause,
and
that's
the
fundamental
denial
in
this
case.
this
defendant,
because
he
was
indigent,
was
not
able
to
go
out
and
hire
a
lawyer
to
present
these
arguable
issues,
which
the
court
of
appeals
found,
to
the
court.
he
was
stuck
with
the
appellate
lawyer,
who
effectively
abandoned
him
before
the
court.
he
had
no
advocacy.
he
had
no
brief.
in
effect,
he
had
no
assistance.
this
court
has
said
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
when
counsel
fails
to
perform,
when
he
fails
to
engage
the
adversary
process,
that
counsel
is
effectively
absent.
that
was
the
holding
of
this
court
in
evitts
v.
lucey.
and
that's
exactly
what
we
have
here:
we
have
no
counsel.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
the
appeal
was
filed,
and
the
appeal
was
dismissed
because
counsel
didn't
comply
with
filing
a
statement
on
appeal.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
well,
the
court
recognized,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
evitts
v.
lucey
that
the
defendant
must
have
more
than
nominal
counsel.
counsel
must
be
effective.
he
must
engage
in
a
performance
which
activates
the
adversary
process.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
the
attorney
here
did
nothing,
other
than
getting
the
appellate
record
to
the
appellate
court.
that's
all
he
did
in
this
case.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
no,
absolutely--
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
--absolutely...
absolutely
not.
counsel
is
required.
then
he
is
to
be
appointed,
then
he
is
required
to
engage
in
a
performance.
if
he's
not
appointed,
that's
a
constitutional
violation.
if
he
fails
to
engage
in
a
constitutional
performance,
that's
a
constitutional
violation.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
well,
strickland,
first
of
all,
applies
the
prejudice
test
where
you
have
a
performance.
strickland
also
says
that
where
counsel
is
denied
or
is
absent
or
fails
to
participate
in
the
adversary
process,
then
prejudice
must
be
presumed,
because
counsel's
presence
and
participation
in
the
adversary
process
is
essential
to
a
reliable
result.
here
we
had
no
participation
by
counsel
in
the
adversary
process.
strickland
says
that
when
counsel
is
absent
or
doesn't
engage
that
process,
then
prejudice
has
to
be
presumed.
so
i
think
in...
we
meet,
clearly,
a
strickland
test,
if
the
court
would
choose
to
apply
a
strickland
test.
but
i
think
as
justice
marshall
has
pointed
out,
that
this
is
clearly
an
anders
and
douglas
violation.
the
court
does
not
have
to
apply
an
effective
assistance
test
to
this
case.
we
would
submit
that
the
prejudice
test
applied
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
does
not
protect
the
right
to
counsel.
this
court
held
in
pennsylvania
v.
finley
that
the
anders
procedures
were
designed
specifically
to
protect
the
right
to
counsel,
and
that
necessarily...
it
necessarily
follows
if
those
procedures
are
not
followed...
if
counsel
may
be
allowed
to
withdraw
from
non-frivolous
cases,
then
the
right
to
counsel
becomes
illusory,
and
indigent
defendants
are
not
afforded
equality
with
non-indigents
on
appeal.
that's
the
fundamental
due
process
violation
in
this
case.
it
further
invites
attorneys
to
abandon
appeals.
if
courts,
or
if
defense
lawyers
know
that
they
can
be
relieved
without
being
required
to
file
an
anders
brief
and
demonstrate
to
the
court
that
an
appeal
is
frivolous,
then
i
think
it
would
invite
wholesale
abandonment
of
clients
and
shifting
of
the
burden
to
the
appellate
court
to
engage
in
that
decision
making
process
without
the
briefing
and
the
oral
argument...
the
cornerstones
of
effective
appellant
decision
making.
there
must
be
an
adversary
process
here,
and
counsel
did
not
engage
that
process.
that's
why
it
cannot
be
relied
upon
as
producing
a
just
result
in
this
case.
we
submit
that
presuming
prejudice,
if
the
court
looks
at
a
strickland
test,
if
it
applies
to
douglas
and
anders
decisions,
consistently
with
this
case,
demonstrates
that
the
violation
is
easy
to
identify.
and
it
accords
fundamental
respect
for
the
right
to
counsel.
this
court
said
in
ross
v.
moffitt
that
an
indigent
must
be
afforded
an
adequate
opportunity
to
present
his
claims
to
an
appellate
court.
mr.
penson
was
not
afforded
that
opportunity.
he
did
not
have
his
claims
presented
by
a
lawyer
to
the
ohio
court
of
appeals.
mr.
penson
has
simply
not
had
his
day
in
court.
we
submit
that
that
is
a
fundamental
due
process
violation.
we've
also
pointed
out
issues,
in
our
reply
brief,
that
mr.
penson
would
have
raised
that
was
raised
by
neither
of
the
co-defendants.
that
points
out
specific
prejudice
to
mr.
penson.
he
has
not
had
an
opportunity
to
have
those
issues
briefed
and
argued
in
the
ohio
court
of
appeals.
that
shows
specific
prejudice,
if
the
court
is
looking
for
prejudice.
if
the
court
does
not
have
any
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
i'm
shocked
that
counsel
for
the
state
of
ohio
describes
this
court's
decision
in
douglas
v.
california
as
a
windfall.
i
think
the
right
to
counsel
on
appeal,
like
the
right
to
counsel
at
trial,
is
much
more
fundamental
than
that.
this
court
indicated
in
evitts
v.
lucey
that
counsel's
presence
is
essential
to
adequate
and
effective
review.
it
certainly
cannot
be
described
as
a
windfall.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
i
think
as
a
matter
of
due
process,
equal
protection,
of
course
guarantee
the
right
to
counsel,
but
the
right
to
effective
assistance
is
required
with
the
evitts
decisions.
the
counsel
just
cannot
just
be
present.
he
must
engage
in
an
effective
performance.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
well,
the
court
did
rely
upon
the
due
process
clause
in
the
evitts
decision.
that
was--
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
--no.
that
was
the
only
issue
presented
by
the
record
on
the
appeal
in
evitts,
so
that
was
the
only
constitutional
provision
relied
upon
by
the
court,
the
due
process
clause.
but
evitts
made
it
very
clear
that
an
attorney
must
file
a
brief
where
there
are
non-frivolous
issues,
where
there
are
arguable
issues.
evitts
specifically
reaffirmed
anders,
and
said
that
when
counsel
fails
to
file
a
brief,
that's
un-constitutional.
that
denies
due
process.
well,
that's
exactly
what
occurred
here.
and
for
counsel
for
the
state
of
ohio
to
say
that
it's
a
windfall
just
goes
against
a
whole
line
of
decisions,
beginning
with
douglas
and
ending
with
mccoy,
four
or
five
decisions
in
between.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
well,
of
course.
he's...
our
position
is,
he
should
have
a
new
appeal
which
he
didn't
get
in
the
first
place.
if
the
court
were
going
to
remand
the
proceeding,
certainly
he
should
have...
if
it's
back
to
the
first
appeal
level,
he
should
certainly
have
a
lawyer.
that's
what
douglas
requires.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
well,
i
think
that
points
up
the
whole
problem
with
this
process,
your
honor.
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
applied
anders,
the
crisp,
bright
line
rule,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
this
simple
case
has
become
a
complex
constitutional
case.
mr.
anders,
if
he
had...
i'm
sorry,
if
mr.
penson
had
gotten
his
appeal
in
the
ohio
court
of
appeals,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
might
be
here
on
some
other
issue,
but
we
wouldn't
be
here
on
the
denial
of
right
to
counsel.
and
that's
what
happens
when
counsel
is
denied
and
the
court
has
to
engage
in
a
prejudice
evaluation
and
so
forth.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
well,
of
course.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
well,
not
on
this
issue--
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
--not
on
this
issue,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
that
points
up
the
problem
with
the
denial
of
counsel.
you
really
have
to
engage
in
a
speculative
exercise
to
figure
out
what
counsel
would
have
done,
or
should
have
done,
and
would
it
have...
what
he
would
have
argued
to
the
appellate
court,
what
the
appellate
court
would
have
decided...
and
this
court
said
in
strickland,
when
counsel
is
denied,
it
really
isn't
worth
the
cost
of
trying
to
figure
out
the
effect
of
the
denial
of
counsel.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
i
think
that's
the
problem
with
applying
a
prejudice
test
in
this
situation.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
there
are
maximums
established
by
the
county,
and
the
lawyer
gets
paid
so
much
an
hour.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
but...
yes.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
i
hope
not.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
if
i
were
on
the
appellate
court,
he
wouldn't
get
anything.
yeah,
i
think
counsel
did--
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
--did
nothing
other
than
review
the
record
in
this
case,
and
didn't
do
his
job
as
he
is
required
constitutionally
to
do.
the
court
did
not
do
its
job
in
requiring
him
to
file
an
advocate's
briefs
where
there
were
arguable
issues.
this
court
made
it
very
clear
in
mccoy
that
where
there
are
arguable
issues,
the
attorney
cannot
serve
the
client's
interest
unless
he
files
an
advocate's
brief.
that
did
not
occur
here,
and
for
the
state
to
argue
that
mr.
penson's
right
to
counsel
was
satisfied
by
a
co-defendant's
lawyer
is
just
totally
inadequate.
when
you're
reviewing
a
record
as
an
advocate,
as
an
appellate
lawyer,
representing
a
client,
you
first
of
all
consult
with
your
client,
and
then
you
review
the
record
with
a
view
to
seeing
if
there
were
errors
in
the
record
that
pertained
to
him.
you're
not
thinking
about
the
other
co-defendants.
you're
looking
for
errors
that
specifically
pertain
to
him,
and
then
you're
filing
an
advocate's
brief
advocating
on
his
behalf
those
particular
errors.
mr.
penson
did
not
get
that.
this
court
made
it
very
clear
in
ross
that
every
defendant
must
be
afforded
an
adequate
opportunity
to
participate
in
his
appeal,
and
to
have
meaningful
access
to
the
appellate
process.
that
was
completely
denied
here.
one
further
point
that
i
would
like
to
address
is
that
the
state
argues
that
we
should
apply
a
prejudice
test
here
because
we
have
a
performance.
evitts
again
points
out
that
counsel,
in
order
to
be
effective,
must
engage
in
a
performance.
when
counsel
does
not
file
a
brief
on
appeal,
he's
engaged
in
nothing.
it's
like
a
lawyer
at
trial
who
goes
out
and
talks
to
all
the
witnesses
but
doesn't
come
into
the
courtroom
and
represent
his
client.
a
brief
on
an
appeal
is
the
primary
tool
by
which
the
appellate
advocate
acts
as
a
sword
to
convince
the
court
that
error
has
occurred.
the
attorney
was
effectively
absent
in
this
case.
he
did
not
participate
in
the
appeal.
mr.
gregory
l.
ayers
well,
that's
between
he
and
his
client,
i
suppose.
but
the
point
is,
with
respect
to
your
question,
justice
scalia,
is
that
client
can
go
to
another
lawyer
and
ask
him,
and
that
lawyer
may
find
issues.
the
monied
defendant
can
get
a
lawyer
to
present
issues,
especially
if
they're
arguable
issues
as
in
this
case.
mr.
penson
could
not
do
that.
he
was
too
poor,
and
he
was
denied
the
equal
protection
which
douglas
v.
california
gives
him.
