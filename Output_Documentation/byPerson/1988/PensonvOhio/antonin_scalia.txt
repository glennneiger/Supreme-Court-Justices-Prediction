justice

of
course,
the
mere
fact
that
the
court
found
an
error
that
counsel
did
not
find
doesn't
show
that
he
was
effectively
deprived
of
the
assistance
of
counsel.
i
mean,
that
could
have
happened
if
counsel
had
filed
a
brief--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
raised
nine
issues
all
of
which
the
court
rejected
but
found,
the
court
might
have
found
on
its
own
a
tenth
issue,
and
you
wouldn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
wouldn't
be
able
to
argue
in
that
case
that
he
was
denied
effective
assistance.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
know
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
certainly
purported
to
do
something,
counsel,
didn't
he?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--he
represented
to
the
ohio
supreme
court
that
he
had
studied
the
case,
and
in
his
judgment,
there
were
no
issues
that
would
justify
reversal.
now,
his
judgment
turned
out
to
be
wrong.
but
it
could
have
turned
out
to
be
wrong
if
he
had
filed
a
brief
as
well.
you
can't
really
say
that
counsel
didn't
work
on
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
you
know
is
that
counsel,
having
worked
on
it,
decided,
incorrectly,
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
case
worth
arguing.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
anders
doesn't
assure
that
the
arguable
issues
will
be
presented
to
the
court
either.
it
doesn't...
an
anders
brief
would
not
give
100
percent
assurance
that
the
good
arguable
issues
would
be
presented
to
the
court.
you
could
have
counsel
who
files
an
anders
brief
that
is
simply
a
bad
brief.
he
misses
the
real
issues
and
decides
to
address
non-issues.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
possible.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
wouldn't
say
that
anders
was
not
satisfied
if
this
same
attorney...
let's
assume
this
same
attorney,
instead
of
filing
a
letter
with
the
court
saying
"i
don't
see
any
arguable
issues.
"
suppose
he
said,
"well,
i'll
write
down
nine
issues
that
don't
seem
to
me
arguable
at
all.
"
he
writes
down
those
nine
issues
that
he
thought
in
this
case
were
not
worth
making...
but
he
writes
them
out,
and
he
says,
"i'll
make
them
anyway"...
missing
three
good
issues.
all
right?
what
would
be
the
result?
would
anders
have
been
satisfied?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
see.
what
you're
arguing
in
this
case
is,
it's
not
just
the
total
absence
of
filing
a
brief,
but
rather,
whenever
a
court
finds
an
arguable
issue
that
is
not
raised
in
an
anders
brief,
it
has
to
appoint
new
counsel
to
argue
that
arguable
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
realize--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
you
know,
at
the
trial
stage,
when
you
don't
have
counsel,
you...
it's
really
possible
to
say,
it's
hard
to
say
that
error
is
harmless
because
you
don't
know
what
the
record
would
have
read
like,
had
you
had
counsel.
you
don't
know
what
facts
would
have
been
in
there.
it's
very
hard
to
say
that
the
error
could
be
harmless.
at
the
appellate
level,
though,
the
facts
are
there.
the
record
is
already
there,
and
you
could
say
that
on
the
basis
of
this
record...
i
don't
care
what
appellate
counsel
you
get...
on
the
basis
of
this
record
which
was
made
with
counsel,
there's
no
way
that
a
jury
could
have
found
anything
except
that
this
person
was
guilty.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
a
basic
difference
between
the
two
levels?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
robinette,
why
can't
you,
why
can't
you
answer
the
question
by
saying
what
equal
protection
requires
is
that
you
have
a
lawyer
who
exerts
his
best
efforts
to
find
something
in
your
case
that
will
justify
reversal
on
appeal?
and
you
can't
say...
there's
no
way
of
saying
that
the
defendant
here
didn't
get
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
know
that
the
lawyer
didn't
find
issues
that
could
have
been
found,
but
that
may
have
been
that
lawyer's
best
effort.
and
if
all
that
we
have
held
that
equal
protection
requires
is
that,
that
you
have
a
lawyer
pay
attention
to
the
case,
and
do
his
best
to
raise
issues
on
appeal,
if
that's
all
that
equal
protection
requires,
that
was
given
here.
and
there
was
no
error.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
it
a
very
efficient
way,
however,
of
making
sure
that
counsel
is
doing
his
best,
even
if
his
best
is
no
good?
at
least
you
make
him
file
a
brief.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
alternative
do
you
have?
i
mean,
suppose,
suppose
we
really
want
to
make
sure
that
this
requirement
we've
imposed
in
anders
is,
is
not
just
symbolism...
that
we're
really
not
just
naming
counsel
but
getting
counsel
to
work
on
the
case?
what,
what
better
way
would
there
be
except
to
make
them
require
either
an
anders
brief
or
an
un-anders
brief,
a
mccoy
brief?
justice
antonin
scalia
wouldn't
that
be
a--
justice
antonin
scalia
--all
right.
we'll
accept
that,
too.
i
mean,
you
either
file
an
anders
brief,
a
mccoy
brief,
or
a
frivolous
brief
on
the
merits.
why
shouldn't
we
have
some
kind
of
rule
like
that,
to
make
sure
that
counsel
are
really
putting
in
their
effort
in
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
no
safeguard
at
all.
you
wouldn't
need
counsel.
i
mean,
you
know,
the
whole
reason
you
need
counsel
is
because
you
don't
trust
an
independent
review
by
the
court
of
appeals.
isn't
that
why
you
have
counsel?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
you
had
full
confidence
that
the
court
of
appeals
would
find
it
on
its
own,
you
wouldn't
require
counsel.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
not
your
answer.
your
answer
is,
it's
not
because
he
didn't
have
a
lawyer,
but
because
he
did
have
a
lawyer
who
knew
ohio
law,
and
knew
that
since
they
hadn't
been
raised
in
the
trial
court,
they
couldn't
be
raised
on
appeal.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
some
could?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
paid
counsel
spends
a
lot
of
time
examining
the
case,
finds
that
there's
nothing
to
it
on
appeal?
he
tells
his
client,
"i'm
sorry,
you
have
no
basis
for
an
appeal.
"
has
he
done
his
job?
could
he
send
him
a
bill
for
that
time?
