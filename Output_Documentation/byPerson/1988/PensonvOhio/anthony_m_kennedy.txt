justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
does
he
have
the
right--
--what
does
that
leave
of
the
anders
rule?
is
it...
if
we
rule
for
you,
doesn't
that
simply
undercut
the
anders
rule
in
any
case
where
counsel
doesn't
want
to
file
a
brief?
we'll
be
right
back
to
where
we
were
before
anders.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
we
should
overrule
anders.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you're
saying,
in
effect,
almost
does
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
we're
talking
about
the
duties
of
counsel,
and
anders
does
have
the
administrative
convenience
of
requiring
attorneys,
at
least
in
the
first
instance,
to
identify
the
arguably
salient
issues
in
the
case.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
aspect
of
anders
is
completely
gone
if
we
rule
for
you
in
this
case,
because
counsel
just
files
a
letter
that
he's
withdrawn.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
just
before
you
do
that,
what's,
what's
at
stake
here
for
your
state?
suppose
we
do
what
you
say.
isn't
that
really
administratively
more
burdensome
from
the
courts?
why
not
just
have
them
file
an
anders
brief?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
burdensome
to
whom?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
does
that
work?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
anders
plus.
but
you're
talking
about
anders
minus,
and
there's
a
difference.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
i
think
the
idaho
procedure
is
a
more,
more
stringent
than
anders,
and
you're
talking
about
something
that
is
less.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then,
why
are
we
talking
about
the
idaho
rule?
it
doesn't
apply.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you're
telling
me
some
states
have
a
more
strict
rule
than
anders,
and
therefore
it
follows
that
others
should
be
able
to
have
a
less
strict
rule.
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
follow.
