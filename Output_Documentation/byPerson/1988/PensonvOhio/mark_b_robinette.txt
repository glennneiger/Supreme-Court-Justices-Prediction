mr.
mark
b.
robinette
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
initially
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
there's
a
critical
factual
distinguishing
feature
between
this
case
and
the
anders
case,
and
that's
that
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
although
the
record
did
contain
arguable
issues,
it
also
found
that
those
arguable
issues
had
already
been
raised
and
decided
in
the
appeals
of
the
co-defendants.
and
i
would
cite
to
page
41
in
the
joint
appendix
the
language
of
the
court
of
appeals,
where
it
said
"our
full
consideration
of
each
may
be
examined
in
the
decisions
rendered
in
the
companion
defendants'
appeals.
"
so
i
think
that's
a
critical
distinguishing
factor
from
the
anders
case.
another
point
in
anders
was
that
part
of
the
reason
for
the
reversal
was
that
the
appellate
court
at
the
state
level
made
no
finding
of
frivolity.
it
did
not
find
whether
or
not
there
were
frivolous
issues
in
the
case.
i
think
basically
what
we're
faced
with
here
is
a
case
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
and
not
a
case
of
denial
of
counsel.
i
think
the
case
is
also
distinguishable
from
the
douglas
case
because
in
douglas
the
defendant
had
to
make
a
preliminary
showing
of
merit
in
order
to
have
counsel
appointed
in
the
first
place,
whereas
in
this
case,
counsel
was
appointed
at
the
outset.
as
soon
as
the
notice
of
appeal
was
filed,
counsel
was
appointed
on
appeal.
there
was
no
outside
interference,
there
was
no
state
interference
with
counsel's
ability
to
handle
the
appeal.
he
had
plenty
of
time.
he
received
at
least
two
or
three
extensions
of
time
to
file
his
brief
in
the
case.
there
was
no
argument
that
there's...
that
counsel
was
laboring
under
any
sort
of
conflict
of
interest
that
would
have
caused
him
any
problem
in
his
prosecution
of
the
appeal.
i
think
what
the
issue
boils
down
to
is
whether
or
not
an
indigent
defendant
in
a
criminal
appeal
has
an
absolute
right
to
have
a
brief
filed
on
his
behalf,
regardless
of
the
merits
of
the
case.
and
it's
the
position
of
the
state
of
ohio
that
he
has
no
such
right.
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
well,
i
would
point
out
that
there's
been
a
lot
of
criticism
of
the
anders
briefing
requirement--
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
--i
don't
think
it
exactly
overrules
anders,
because
i
think
a
key
feature
of
the
anders
decision
is
the
independent
review
requirement.
the
court
is
required
to
make
an
independent
review
of
the
record
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
any
prejudicial
error
existed
in
the
record.
i
think
that's
a
key
here.
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
i
think
counsel
is
still
required
to
be
appointed,
and
he's
still
required
to
review
the
record.
i
think
what's
needed
is
more
flexibility
on
behalf
of
the
state
appellate
court.
the
court
has
a
number
of
options.
the
court
doesn't
have
to
take
counsel
at
his
word.
it
can
review
the
record.
if
it's
not
satisfied
with
his
review
of
the-record,
the
court
can
say,
"go
back
and
do
it
again.
"
"we're
not
satisfied
with
the
job
you
did.
"
the
court
can
refuse
to
pay
counsel
if
it
doesn't
think
he
did
an
adequate
job.
the
court
can
appoint
new
counsel
to
go
back
and
do
a
brief,
or
it
can
order
the
original
attorney
to
file
a
brief.
i
think
the
state
appellate
court
has
a
number
of
options
here.
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
i
don't
believe
so
in
this
case,
because
the
arguable
issues
had
already
been
raised
and
decided.
i
think
if
it
found
new
arguable
issues--
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
--well,
he
did
not
have
a
lawyer
argue
those
issues
in
the
court
of
appeals,
i
would
agree
with
that.
but
he
did
have
a
lawyer--
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
--i
don't
believe
so,
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
i
believe
if
the
court
finds
arguable
issues
in
the
record,
and
those
issues
have
not
been
raised
and
have
not
been
litigated,
then
i
think
the
court
has
the
option...
perhaps
the
duty...
to
appoint
counsel
under
anders.
it
would
have--
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
--i
don't
believe
so
in
this
case,
because
those
issues
had
already
been
decided.
i
think
it
would
be
a--
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
--but
it
is
the
same
record,
though.
they're
all...
there
were
three
defendants
jointly
tried
at
trial.
they
were
all
bound
by
the
same
record
on
appeal.
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
well,
i
disagree
with
that.
i
think
that--
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
--i
think--
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
--i
think
because...
you
might
have
some
equal
protection
problems
if
you
did
not
appoint
counsel
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
because
i
don't
believe,
according
to--
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
--well,
as
the
court
said,
as
the
chief
justice
said
in
ross
v.
moffitt,
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
require
absolute
equality
nor
precisely
equal
advantages.
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
i
think
there
may
be
an
inequality
of
representation
rendered.
there's
no
inequality
in
the
appointment
of
counsel
in
this
case.
that's
the
key
distinction,
i
believe.
each,
each
defendant
was
appointed
separate
counsel
to
prosecute
the
appeal.
two
of
them
filed
briefs,
one
moved
to
withdraw.
i
don't
think
that
creates
an
equal
protection
violation
on
the
part
of
the
court.
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
yes,
it
had.
it
clearly...
well,
not
at
the
time
they
ruled
on
the
motion
to
withdraw.
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
i
don't
think
that's
the
preferred
practice.
i
think
they
should
have--
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
--okay,
i'll
admit
that
was
error.
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
but
certainly
if
that's
error--
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
--not
if
they're
not
issues
yet
to
be
raised
that
have
not
already
been
decided.
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
in
the
same
case,
based
on
the
same
record.
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
no,
i
think
that--
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
--i
think
you
would
have
a
problem
with
douglas
in
that
situation,
your
honor,
because
counsel--
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
--i
think
the
right
to
counsel
guarantees
the
opportunity
to
have
the
assistance
of
counsel.
it
doesn't
necessarily
dictate
what
counsel
is
going
to
do.
i
think
what
counsel
does--
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
--then
i
think
that
puts
it
precisely
in
the
frame
of
a
claim
of
ineffective
assistance
of
appellate
counsel.
i
think
basically
what
the
claim
is
is
appellate
counsel
did
a
sloppy
job
of
reviewing
the
record.
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
that's
true.
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
i
think
that
you
can
certainly
tell
better
in
the
framework
of
the
appellate
process.
you
can
measure
prejudice
much
easier
in
the
appellate--
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
--well,
douglas
requires
it.
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
well,
i
wasn't
prepared
to
address
that,
but
that
could
be
initiated
and
addressed.
[laughter]
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
okay.
i
think
the
guarantee
of
equal
protection
means
substantial
equality,
but
doesn't
mean
precise
and
absolute
equality,
so
i
think
counsel
has
to
be
appointed
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
that
can
happen
sometimes.
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
i
think,
though,
there's
a
key
distinction,
too,
between
the
trial
process
and
the
appellate
process,
because
as
justice
stevens
noted
in
the
mccoy
case,
there's
never
a
duty
to
withdraw
at
trial.
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
probably
so.
i
think
that's
another
part
of
the
problem.
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
well,
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
i
agree,
justice
scalia.
i
couldn't
have
put
it
better
myself.
i
think
equal
protection--
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
--what
i'm
saying
is,
i
think
we
don't
have
an
equal
protection--
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
--yes.
i
think
if
we
have
error...
i
mean,
certainly
the
anders
issue
is
a
very
close
issue
in
the
case,
and
it's
close
because
of
the
factual
distinguishing
features
between
this
case
and
the
anders
case,
the
co-defendants
and
the
fact
that
they
did
review
the
arguable
issues
in
the
case.
and
they
had
already
decided
the
arguable
issues.
but
even
if
there's
an
anders
violation,
i
don't
believe
that
precludes
this
court
from
applying
a
harmless
error
analysis
to
an
anders
violation,
especially
in
light
of
some
of
the
other
cases--
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
--i
think
in
the
ordinary
sense,
the
court
would
review
the
record
to
see
if
any
error--
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
--i...
i...
no,
i'm
not
saying
that
at
all,
because
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
in
effect
made
a
finding
that
there
was--
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
--i
think
initially
this
court
has
to
decide
whether
or
not
harmless
error
analysis
is
appropriate.
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
i
would
like
to
see
the
court
decide
the
case.
i
don't
believe
remand
is
necessary,
although
the
court
may
feel
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
precisely
apply
a
harmless
error
test,
and
you
may
remand
for
that
purpose.
that's
a
closed
question
there.
i
think
in
effect
they
made
a
finding
there
was
no
prejudice,
and
the
error
that
he
may
have
sustained
in
the
case
was
harmless.
and
i
would
like
to
address
briefly
some
of
the
issues
that
were
raised
at
the
eleventh
hour--
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
--well,
there's
a
lot
of
arguments
made
that
anders
briefs
are
much
more
burdensome
than
requiring
a
court
appointed
counsel
just
to
file
a
frivolous
brief
on
the
merits--
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
--burdensome
to
the
courts,
burdensome
to
counsel...
there
are
four
states
now
that
are
refusing
to
follow
the
anders
briefing
procedure.
and
they
follow
the
so-called
idaho
rule,
which
is
discussed
in
some
of
the
articles
mentioned
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
ohio--
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
--defense
lawyers
association.
the
idaho
rule
merely
says,
straightforward,
that
counsel,
appointed
counsel
may
not
withdraw
from
an
appeal
on
the
ground
that
it's
meritless
or
frivolous.
so,
in
effect,
what
those
states
hold
is
he
must
file
a
frivolous
brief.
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
that's
true.
i...
i
think
mccoy
is--
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
--well,
the
idaho
rule
is
also
unethical,
because
it
requires--
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
--that's
true,
it
doesn't
apply
here.
but
i
think
there's
some
policy
considerations
to
be
considered.
i
think
the
anders
case...
that's
part
of
the
problem
with
the
anders
case.
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
well,
i
think
it
goes
to
what
justice
stewart
said
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
anders.
part
of
the
problem
is,
there
may
not
be
one
right
answer
to
cover
every
situation
in
the
50
states
dealing
with
court
appointed
counsel
on
appeal.
and
i
think
the
mccoy
case
has
recognized
that,
because
in
mccoy,
this
court
upheld
a
court
rule
in
wisconsin
that
went
beyond
anders.
i
think
that's
a
recognition
that
maybe
there's
not
just
one
right
answer
in
the
situation...
that
there
may
be
other
ways
of
handling
the
situation.
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
i
think
it
was
primarily...
i
think
there's
some
overlap
there,
as
the
chief
justice
has
noted
in
some
opinions,
between
due
process
and
equal
protection.
i
think
it
was
primarily
an
equal
protection
case,
because
they
felt
like
it
was
not
substantial
equality
in
the
case,
and
you
had
to
have
substantial
equality,
although
you
don't
have
to
have
absolute
equality.
but
in
this
case,
i
think
you've
got--
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
--i
don't
believe
there
was
error.
i
agree
with
justice
scalia.
i
don't
think
there
was
error.
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
this
case,
i
think,
is
primarily
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
because
there
was
no
equal
protection
violation.
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
pardon?
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
no,
it's
not.
and
effective
assistance
is
due
process.
but
my
argument
here
is,
there
was
no
equal
protection
violation.
he
received
substantial
equality
because
he
had
counsel
appointed
in
the
first
instance,
and
counsel
had
the
opportunity
to
review
the
record.
that
basically
the
claim
is,
he
just
didn't
do
an
adequate
job
reviewing
the
record,
did
not
file
a
brief,
and
i
believe
the
claim
is
they
think
he
should
have
filed
a
brief.
and
i
believe
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
aclu
basically
advocates
a
position
that
they
would
rather
have
a
brief
filed
in
every
case.
but
i
don't
think
that's
required
by
the
constitution.
and
i
think
the
procedure
that
was
employed
in
this
case
satisfied
both
due
process
and
equal
protection.
and
if
there's
a
claim--
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
--you're
referring
to
the
anders
procedure?
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
it's
a
way
of
assuring
that.
i'm
not
so
sure
how
efficient
it
is,
because
a
lot
of
counsels
don't
understand
exactly
what
they
have
to
do
to
comply
with
the
true
anders
brief.
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
um-hum.
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
i
agree.
i
think
part
of
the
problem
is,
however,
a
lot
of
attorneys
don't
like
the
anders
briefing
procedure,
because
they
feel
like
it
forces
them
to
brief
the
case
against
their
client.
it
puts
a
counsel
into
a
very
difficult
situation,
because
on
the
one
hand,
he's
moving
the
court
to
withdraw
on
the
grounds
that
the
appeal
has
no
merit,
and
on
the
other
hand,
he's
pointing,
raising
issues
in
the
brief,
so-called
arguable
issues,
but
he's
saying
these
issues
are
frivolous.
so,
therefore,
he
withdraws
from
the
case
on
that
basis,
and
that
puts
counsel
in
a
very
difficult
situation.
a
lot
of
attorneys,
quite
frankly,
would
just
rather
file
a
frivolous
brief
on
the
merits
and
be
done
with
it.
that's
the
easiest
thing
to
do.
maybe
it's
what
i
would
do,
if
i
was
in
that
situation.
i
don't
know,
but
it's--
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
--well,
i
think
again,
the
problem
with
requiring
that
brief
on
the
merits
to
be
filed
is
it
would
be
unethical
in
some
cases.
i
think
the
independent
review
requirement
where
the
court
of
appeals
independently
reviews
the
record
is
a
way
to
provide
a
safeguard--
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
--i
think
you
have
counsel
so
he
can
act
on
client's
behalf
and
raise
the
issues
that
he
thinks
ought
to
be
raised
in
the
case.
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
i
think
you
at
least
have
to
require
counsel
to
examine
the
record,
and
obviously
this
court
in
anders
didn't
feel
like
that
was
enough.
they
felt
like
the
anders
brief
was
required
to
ensure
that
factor,
but
in
any
event,
even
with
the
anders
requirement
in
place...
and
it
doesn't
appear
this
court
is
ready
to
do
away
with
the
anders
briefing
requirement...
based
on
my
reading
of
the
mccoy
decision,
i
think
there
still
was
no
anders
violation
in
this
case
by
the
court
of
appeals.
it
still
boils
down,
in
my
view,
to
a
situation
where
it's
claimed
that
council
just
did
a
sloppy
job
and
did
not
brief
the
case,
and
should
have
briefed
the
case.
but
i
think
that
ought
to
be
judged
on
a
deficient
performance
standard,
not
on
presumption
of
prejudice
standard.
it
makes
no
sense
to
presume
prejudice
in
a
case
like
this
when
the
court
doesn't
presume
prejudice
in
many
cases
of
right
to
counsel
violations
at
trial.
recently
in
the
satterwhite
case,
satterwhite
v.
texas,
the
court
held
that
harmless
error
analysis
applied
to
a
counsel,
right
to
counsel
deprivation
in
a
capital
sentencing
proceeding.
and
certainly
the
difficulty
of
measuring
prejudice
in
a
case
like
that
is
much
greater
than
the
difficulty
of
measuring
prejudice
on
an
appeal
situation
like
anders,
where
regardless
of
who
the
attorney
is,
he's
bound
by
the
same
record.
it
doesn't
matter
who
you
appoint...
you
could
appoint
15
different
attorneys.
they've
all
got
to
examine
the
same
record.
they
can't
go
outside
the
record.
they
can't
introduce
new
evidence.
they've
got
to
pull
their
issues
out
of
that
record.
and
i
think
that's...
makes
prejudice
much
easier
to
measure,
and
i
think
certainly
if
the
court
does
not
want
to
adopt
a
strickland
type
test
in
a
situation
like
this,
certainly
harmless
error
analysis
is
appropriate
in
any
event.
there's
no
good
reason
why
harmless
error
analysis
would
not
apply
in
a
case
like
this.
briefly,
as
far
as
some
of
the
issues
that
were
raised
in
the
reply
brief...
and
i'll
refer
to
pages
9
through
11
of
petitioner's
reply
brief...
he
raised
some
issues
that
he
says
prejudiced
mr.
penson,
because
they
were
not
raised,
and
they
could
have
been
raised.
i
would
note,
also,
that
mr.
penson
had
the
same
attorney
that
he
has
now...
the
same
office
represented
him
on
his
discretionary
appeal
to
the
ohio
supreme
court,
and
basically
they
were
complaining
about
the
job
that
the
court
appointed
appellate
counsel
did
in
that
court,
that
they
made
no
effort
to
raise
any
of
these
issues
before
the
ohio
supreme
court,
nor
did
they
make
any
effort
to
raise
any
of
these
issues
at
any
time
until
the
reply
brief
was
filed
in
this
case.
the
first
thing
they
refer
to
is
that
the
trial
court
erred
in
convicting
and
sentencing
penson
for
both
having
the
weapon
under
a
disability
in
count
29
of
the
indictment
and
the
firearms
specification
that
accompanied
that
indictment.
and
they
claim
that
that's
a
violation
of
ohio's
multiple-count
statute,
and
also
a
violation
of
double
jeopardy
provisions.
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
that's
on
page
9.
the
issues
they
raise
go
from
page
9
through
page
11.
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
that's
true.
that
may
be
one
reason
why
the
court
would
want
a
remand
on
a
consideration
of
those
issues.
however,
i
think
that
those
issues
are
clearly
without
merit,
and
that's
why
they
were
not
raised
until
such
a
late
time
in
this
proceeding.
there's
ohio
case
law
that
holds
that
those
statutes
are
not
one
and
the
same
statute,
and
they
do
not
violate
the
multiple
count
statute.
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
no,
because
they
were
never
raised
in
the
state
court.
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
yes.
and
i
think
petitioner's
argument
is
that
he
was
deprived
of
the
opportunity
to
have
those
issues
decided.
but
my
position
is,
those
issues
could
have
been
raised
under
the
guise
of
an
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim
to
the
ohio
supreme
court,
that's
often
done.
that's
a
way
that's
often
used
to
get
around
the
ordinary
rule
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
will
not
rule
on
an
issue
that
wasn't
raised
in
the
lower
court.
it's
done
all
the
time
under
the
guise
of
ineffective
assistance.
but
yet
they
were
not
raised
at
that
point.
the
court
may
not
want
to--
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
--they
were
not
raised
there,
it's
true.
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
well,
i
suppose
you
could
make
the
argument.
you
could
come
up
with
any
number
of
issues
that
could
have
been
raised
in
hindsight.
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
some
of
these
issues
could
have
been
raised
on
appeal,
i
think,
because--
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
--it's
a
judgment
call
whether
or
not
the
lawyer
thinks
they
have
any
merit.
some
of
these
issues
had
already
been
decided
by
the
same
appellate
court
adversely
to
the
position
that
petitioner
now
takes.
i
mean,
is
the
lawyer
obligated
to
raise
an
issue
that's
already
been
decided
by
the
appellate
court
in
his
district?
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
again,
we
get
back
to
the
situation
where
a
lawyer
was
appointed
in
the
first
instance,
and
he
made
a
judgment
call
not
to
raise
certain
issues.
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
he
may
not
have
done
a
lot,
that's
for
sure.
but
he
was
appointed.
i
don't
think
you
can
blame
the
appellate
court
for
the
lawyer's,
perhaps
poor,
performance
in
the
case.
i
think
it's
a
situation
where
you
have
to
judge
the
lawyer's
performance,
because
i
don't
think
the
appellate
court
has
violated
mr.
penson's
rights.
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
if
the
court
comes
to
that
conclusion
midway
through
the
appeal,
they
always
have
the
option
to
dismiss
this
attorney
from
the
case
and
appoint
another
attorney.
there's
no
problem
with
that.
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
i
don't
think
they
were
particularly
pleased
with
the
job
that
he
did.
but
i
think
the
viewpoint
of
the
court
was
there
was
no
prejudice
from
what
he
did,
based
upon
the
issues
raised
in
the
other
cases
and
its
own
review
of
the
record,
and
to
appoint
another
attorney
at
that
point
in
time
to
review
the
same
record
would
have
been
a
fruitless
exercise.
i
think
that's
basically
the
court's
position.
that's
basically
a
no
prejudice,
harmless
error
type
decision
on
their
part.
and
i
think
they're
correct
in
that
determination.
i
think
what,
basically,
petitioner
would
have
this
court
do
is
give
him
a
windfall,
give
him
a
second
bite
at
the
apple
all
the
way
up
the
appellate
ladder,
and
for
what?
when
he
suffered
no
prejudice
in
the
first
place,
i
really
don't
see
what
it
would
accomplish,
other
than
to
go
put
the
state
through
another
enormous
expense.
mr.
mark
b.
robinette
yes,
yes.
i'm
not
sure
what
the
pay
schedule
is,
but
they
are
appointed
by
the
court
and
they
are
paid
by
the
state.
now,
in
this
case,
maybe
he
should
not
have
been
paid,
but
as
it's
been
pointed
out,
it's
hard
to
judge
from
what
appears
in
the
record
exactly
how
much
time
he
put
in.
they
are
required
to
file
a
statement
of
their
hours
in
the
case.
and
i
haven't
seen
that...
i
don't
know
how
many
hours
he
claimed
to
have
put
in,
but
the
transcript
was
approximately
900
pages.
if
he
just
read
the
transcript,
he
would
have
had
to
put
in
a
number
of
hours
just
doing
that.
but
again,
you
know,
a
lot
of
this
is
a
judgment
call,
and
you're
basically
judging
the
attorney's
performance.
and
by
judging
the
attorney's
performance,
i
think
it
ought
to
be
judged
under
a
prejudice
standard
as
whether
or
not
the
client
actually
suffered
any
prejudice.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
that
would
conclude
my
argument.
