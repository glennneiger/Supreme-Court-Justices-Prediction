chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
87-6116,
steven
penson
v.
ohio.
mr.
ayers,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
useful
relief
can
we
give
mr.
penson
in
this
case,
assuming
that
everything
you
say
is,
have
said
so
far
is
correct?
does
he
go
back
and
have
a
lawyer
argue
his
case
again
to
the
ohio
court
of
appeals?
is
there
any
real
chance
they
would
change
their
mind?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
make
any
argument
here
as
to
the
fact
that
this
error
was
not
harmless,
or
do
you
say
no
harmless
error
standard
can
be
applied?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well...
mr.
penson
had
counsel.
the
counsel
didn't
perform
as
he
should
have.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
counsel
was
appointed
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he...
he
didn't
serve
the
way
he
ought
to
have
under
the
anders
rule.
but
that's
not
a
failure
to
appoint
counsel,
that's
counsel's
mistakes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we've
never
held
that,
have
we,
that
you
have
to...
if
the
court
disagrees
with
a
no
merit
presentation
in
anders,
the
court
then
has
to
appoint
another
counsel?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
either
of
those
cases
involve
a
situation
in
which
a
court
had
found...
had
found
that
the
no
merit
statement
was
wrong,
and
that
there
were
arguable
issues?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
i
was
asking
about
a
holding,
not
about
language
in
cases.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
i
was
asking
about
was
a
situation
where
anders
is
complied
with
and
the
court
disagrees
with
the
presentation.
you
say
there
is
a
case
from
this
court
holding
that
there
counsel...
a
new
counsel
must
be
appointed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do...
did
it
hold
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
understand
what
a
holding
is?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
say
it
held
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
find...
holding
means
that
a
particular
question
is
presented
for
decision,
the
case
turns
on
that,
and
the
court
adopts
one
view
or
another
of--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that
particular
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that,
this,
a
harmless
error?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
harmless
error
test
apply
there,
or
do
you
say
that
there
can
be
no
harmless
error
analysis?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
evitts
v.
lucey,
no
appeal
was
ever
taken,
was
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
nothing
was
done.
here,
i
think,
as
justice
scalia
points
out,
the
lawyer
did
something.
you
say
it
was
wrong,
and
grossly
inadequate,
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
same
thing
as
just
saying
that
he
never...
he
wasn't
even
there.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
you're
suggesting
that
counsel
must
be
effective,
as
i
take
it,
the
word
you
just
used...
in
order
for
there
to
have
been
assistance
of
counsel
furnished.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
we
have,
our
strickland
case
says
exactly
the
opposite
of
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
is...
but
then
how
do
you,
how
do
you
interpret
strickland?
strickland
says
if
it's
claimed
as
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
you
don't
just
automatically
do
the
whole
thing
over.
you
look
at
was
there
any
prejudice.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ayers.
mr.
robinette,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
difficult
to
see
how
we
could
evaluate
some
question
of
ohio
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
robinette.
mr.
ayres,
you
have
seven
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ayers.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
87-6116,
penson
against
ohio
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
