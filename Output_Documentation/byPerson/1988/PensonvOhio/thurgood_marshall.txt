justice
thurgood
marshall
wasn't
the
same
type
of
letter
in
the
anders
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
like
the
anders
letter
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
anders
covers
you,
why
do
you
want
to
extend
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
do
you
want
to
extend
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
don't
you
just
rely
on
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
you
are
trying
to
extend
it,
and
for
no
good
reason.
justice
thurgood
marshall
wasn't
that
the--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--wasn't
that
settled
in
the
douglas
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
see
what--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--the
court
could
have
gone
on
its
own.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
court
could
have
gone
on
without
the
lawyer
in
douglas,
but
this
court
said
that
you
couldn't
do
that.
you
had
to
give
him
a
lawyer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
on
the
question
of
[inaudible],
have
in
your
own
practice,
have
you
ever
won
a
case
you
didn't
expect
to
win?
justice
thurgood
marshall
sure,
it's
possible,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
on
a
case
on
appeal
that
you
didn't
expect
to
win?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
see
how
we
can
decide
that,
when
there
was
no
lawyer
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
douglas
case,
that's
where
we
get.
he's...
you
haven't
touched
it.
