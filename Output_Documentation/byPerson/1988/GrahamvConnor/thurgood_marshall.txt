what
reason
was
there
for
handcuffing
a
diabetic
in
a
coma?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
was
he
doing
that
was
so
violent
that
he
had
to
be
handcuffed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
violent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
did
he
do
that
was
violent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
was
he
doing,
i'm
talking
about
before
they
put
the
handcuffs
on
him.
what
was
he
doing
before
they
tried
to
put
the
handcuffs
on?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
that
threatening
anybody?
did
he
strike
anybody?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
strike
anybody?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
threaten
to
strike
anybody?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
you
answer,
did
he
threaten
to
strike
anybody?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
have
a
weapon
of
any
kind?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
record
didn't
show
he
had
a
weapon
of
any
kind?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
was
he
handcuffed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
bizarre
an
explainable
word,
or
does
it
cover
anything?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
does
it
cover?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
was
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
shouldn't
a
diabetic
object
to
being
arrested
rather
than
given
treatment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
was
he
handcuffed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
order
to
protect
himself?
justice
thurgood
marshall
may
i
differ
from
that
conclusion?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
five
officers
with
loaded
guns
and
a
handcuffed
prisoner,
and
they
need
to
do
something
else?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
they
need
to
do
anything
else
to
maintain
peace
and
order?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
did
they
need
five?
why
did
they
have
to
use
that
kind
of
language?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
that's
a
part
of
it
in
my
book.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
big
was
this
man?
justice
thurgood
marshall
five
policemen,
fully
armed,
can
take
care
of
one
prisoner
without
maltreating
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
or
no?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
didn't
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
maltreated
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
picked
him
up
and
shoved
him
in
the
back
of
a
car.
justice
thurgood
marshall
before
you
go
too
far
on
these
"everys"
we're
dealing
with
one
diabetic.
we're
not
talking
about
murderers
and
criminals.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
criminal
suspects
are
not
guilty.
