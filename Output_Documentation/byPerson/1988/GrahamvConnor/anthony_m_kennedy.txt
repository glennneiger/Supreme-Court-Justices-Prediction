but
does
the
subjective
factor
have
any
bearing
on
any
immunity
that
the
officers
might
have?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
under
your
view,
i
take
it,
the
immunity
analysis
collapses
into
the
objective
analysis
under
the
4th
amendment
and
the
issue
is
simply
the
same?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
there
was
reliance,
because
of
reliance
on
a
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
this
case...
in
this
case,
are
the
two
inquiries
precisely
the
same?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
can't
hypothesize
any
case
in
which
a
seizure
is
objectively
unreasonable
and
there
is
good
faith?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
only
with
the
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
was
a
statute
there.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
should
the
jury
be
instructed
that
if
the
facts
are
as
you
state
them
to
be
they
must
bring
in
a
verdict
for
the
plaintiff?
does
the
jury
decide
reasonableness
in
every
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
this
case,
if
the
evidence
is
as
you
have
explained
it,
and
i
recognize
only
one
side
has
testified,
then
as
a
matter
of
law
is
it
an
unreasonable
seizure?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
there
a
seizure
here?
