justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
two
whispering
over
there,
or
what's
going
on?
i
can't
hear
what
you're
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
but
the
dissenting
opinion
did.
judge
butzner
cited
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
weren't
exactly
a
mystery,
those
cases
at
that
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
those
are
new
cases.
i
would
think
the
court
of
appeals
normally
would
address
itself
when
the
dissenting
judge
cites
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
do
that,
mr.
levy,
what
about
the
reasonableness
of
not
following
up
on
his
request
that
they
look
at
the
card
in
his
pocket
that
would
indicate
he
was
a
diabetic.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
they
were
on
reasonable
notice
of
the
fact
that
he
was
a
diabetic
and
desperately
in
need
of
orange
juice
that
wouldn't
affect
the
reasonableness?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
said
he
was.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
didn't
have
to
guess.
couldn't
they
ask
his
companion
what
they
were
trying
to
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
think
the
reasonable
police
officer
should
do
in
that
circumstance?
dump
the
man
in
the
car
and
take
him
home
and
dump
him
on
the
lawn?
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
by
the
police
officers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
by
the
police
officers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
one
other
question
that
was
prompted
by
something
justice
o'connor
asked.
if
we
adopt
a
purely
objective
standard
as
everyone
suggests,
is
the
language
that
the
officers
used
relevant
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
not
itself
be
an
unreasonable
aspect
of
a
way
in
which
one
seizes
a
citizen,
to
use
that
kind
of
language?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
it
would
ever
be
harmful
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
have
sufficient
factual
basis
for
a
terry
stop.
is
it
appropriate
or
is
it
reasonable
for
the
officer
to
use
epithets
and
things.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not
relevant,
even?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
it
might
incite
further
confrontation
and
the
like
and
help
bring
the
crowd
around
and
all
that
sort
of
thing.
well
anyway,
you
say
it's
totally
irrelevant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
levy,
i
hate
to
keep
interrupting
you,
but
i
think
there
is
a
lot
in
the
opinion
that
supports
your
argument
that
the
court
was
basically
applying
an
objective
standard.
but
the
one
comment
that
i
wish
you'd
comment
on
is
the
second
paragraph
of
footnote
3,
when
the
court
points
out
that
they
don't
think
there
should
be
a
conceptual
difference
between
8th
amendment
standard
and
the
4th
amendment
standard.
i
read
that
as
the
court
of
appeals
applying
the
equivalent
of
an
8th
amendment
standard
in
a
4th
amendment
context.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
agree
one
can
read
that
as
also
an
objective
standard,
but
it's
a
much
more
severe,
it's
a
different
standard
than
the
4th
amendment
standard,
or
is
it?
do
you
think
it
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
court
of
appeals
seems
to
have
applied
a
standard
that
would
be
the
same
standard
in
an
8th
amendment
context.
that's
what
i'm
saying.
and
if
you
don't
urge
that,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
not
defending
the
court
of
appeals
rationale.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
not
making
the
objective
subject
dichotomy,
but
just
saying
that
theirs
is
a
more
severe
objective
test
than
the
proper
objective
test
would
be.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
levy,
your
test
is
kind
of
a
rational
basis
test
to
boil
it
down,
isn't
it?
