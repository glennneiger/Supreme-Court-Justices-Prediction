mr.
mark
i.
levy
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
think
petitioner
has
misunderstood
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
this
case.
that
decision
does
not
implicate
the
question
the
petitioner
has
asked
this
court
to
decide.
the
question
presented
and
briefed
and
argued
today
by
petitioner
is
whether
excessive
force
claims
under
the
4th
amendment
and
section
1983
are
governed
by
a
subjective
test.
now,
let
me
note
that
the
petitioner
himself
concedes
in
his
brief
that
he
never
focused
his
claim
on
the
4th
amendment
either
in
the
district
court
or
in
the
court
of
appeals.
indeed,
his
complaint
nowhere
refers
to
the
4th
amendment,
even
though
it
was
filed
some
approximately
four
months
after
garner
was
decided.
and
today,
petitioner
faults
the
court
of
appeals
for
not
referring
to
either
terry
or
garner
in
its
opinion,
out
i
note
that
his
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
cited
neither
of
those
cases.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
correct,
it
did.
but
this
case
was
never
focused--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--excuse
me?
mr.
mark
i.
levy
it
certainly
could
have.
but
we
don't
think
this
case
presents
the
question
the
petitioner
seeks
to
raise
in
this
court,
for
the
decisions
and
the
judgments
below
do
not
depend
upon
the
application
of
a
subjective
test,
and
i
say
that
for
two
reasons.
first,
the
phrase
"maliciously
and
sadistically"
does
not,
as
petitioner
believes,
refer
to
the
actual
subjective
intent
of
the
officers.
indeed,
at
the
trial
here,
no
one
ever
suggested
that
subjective
intent
was
an
element.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
we
agree
that
it
can
be
analyzed
under
the
4th
amendment.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
yes,
we
would
agree
with
that.
i
think
there
are
some
cases
i
should
add,
and
this
one
may
be
debatable,
that
could
be
decided
under
the
5th
amendment
standard.
the
test
proposed
by
petitioner
is
that
the
4th
amendment
seizure
continue
so
long
as
the
arrestee
is
in
the
company
of
the
arresting
officers,
which
could
continue
after
bail
has
been
set
and
the
person
bound
over
in
the
local
jail.
so
we
think
that
test
goes
very
far,
but
on
these
facts
as
we've
got
them
today
we
don't
object
to
the
application
of
a
4th
amendment
analysis.
but
as
i
was
saying,
the
trial
in
this
case,
no
one
ever
suggested
that
subjective
malice
was
an
element
of
petitioner's
cause
of
action,
and
petitioner
never
even
attempted
to
prove
the
subjective
intent
of
the
officers.
now
the
4th
circuit
itself
explained
in
this
case
that
"concepts
such
as
malicious
and
sadistic
should
be
understood
as
descriptions
of
the
degrees
of
force
that
exceed
the
state's
privilege
and
thereby
implicate
intrusions
into
constitutionally
protected
personal
security.
"
the
en
banc
4th
circuit
offered
the
same
explanation
in
its
subsequent
opinion
in
justice
against
dennis,
which
was
rendered
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
petition
in
this
case.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
no.
it
was
an
attempt
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
define
that
level
of
force
that
constitutes
a
constitutional
violation.
it
is
not
the
subjective
intent
of
the
officers.
a
malice
standard
in
law
is
often
an
objective
standard,
and
under
the
4th--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--i
think
in
common
law
immunity
defenses,
for
example.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
believe
that's
right.
malice
can
be
inferred
from
the
objective
circumstances,
and
the
court
said
as
much
in
this
case
and
in
its--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--they
could
be
used
in
that
way,
but
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--we
read
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
this
case
and
in
justice
subsequent
en
banc
decision
to
explain
that
it
was
an
objective
test:
that
it's
a
legal
description
of
that
level
of
force
that
is
more
than
simply
a
battery
under
state
law
and
reaches
the
level
of
a
constitutional
violation.
so
it
is
not
an
objective...
i
mean,
it
is
not
a
subjective
standard
that
looks
to
the
intent
of
the
jury.
now,
it
may
well
be
that
other
words
could
be
better
chosen
to
accomplish
that,
but
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
has
sufficiently
explained
itself.
but
let
me
say,
equally
important,
even
if
the
court
of
appeals
did
think
that
in
general
a
subjective
test
was
appropriate
here,
the
decisions
of
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
did
not
turn
in
any
way
on
any
subjective
standard.
rather,
both
courts
held
the
respondent's
conduct
was
objectively
reasonable
considering
the
need
for
force,
the
amount
of
force
used
and
the
extent
of
the
injuries
that
petitioner
has
alleged.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
at
the
time
the
officers
didn't
know
that
he
was
a
diabetic
in
a
coma.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
you
have
to
go
back
one
step
even
before
that.
officer
connor
saw
petitioner
act
in
a
very
suspicious
and
unusual
manner.
he
saw
connor
hurrying
from
the
convenience
store.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
it
wasn't
clear.
he
saw
him
hurry
into
a
convenience
store.
he
was
hurrying
out.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
testimony.
petitioner's
own
witness
said
that
petitioner
was
throwing
his
hands
around;
that
he
was
resisting
putting
the
handcuffs
on;
that
berry
had
asked
for
officer
connor's
help
in
catching--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
he
was
acting
in
a
very
bizarre
manner.
he
ran
out
of
the
car,
circled
around
it
twice
and
then
sat
down.
at
that
point,
berry
asked
for
connor's
help
in
catching
the
petitioner,
and
berry
testified
without
contradiction
at
trial
that
even
at
that
point,
before
any
handcuffs
were
being
considered,
petitioner
was
throwing
his
hands
around.
the
district
court--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--well,
the
officers
didn't
have
to
wait
until
he
was--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--i
don't
believe
the
record
indicates
that
he
struck
anybody.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
he
was
acting
in
an
unpredictable
and
potentially
dangerous
manner.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
he
did
not
overtly
threaten
to
strike
anyone.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
the
record
doesn't
indicate,
i
don't
believe.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
the
record
shows
that
he
was
properly
stopped
as
a
suspect
for
a
criminal
investigation;
that
he
was
acting
suspiciously;
that
he
was
acting
in
a
bizarre
manner;
that
mr.
berry
asked
for
officer
connor's
help.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
no,
it
doesn't
cover
anything.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
it
covers,
certainly,
petitioner's
conduct
in
this
case.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
and
mr.
berry
so
said.
he
said
he
didn't
know
what
was
wrong
with
petitioner.
it
might
be
an
insulin
reaction,
a
sugar
reaction.
he'd
never
seen
one.
he
was
scared.
he
didn't
know
what
to
do.
he
asked
for
officer
connor's
help.
he
testified
that
petitioner
was
throwing
his
hands
around.
the
district
court
stated
without
contradiction
that
when
the
back-up
officers
were
arriving
a
scuffle
started,
and
at
that
point
the
officers
sought
to
put
the
handcuffs
on
petitioner.
he
resisted
the
handcuffs.
he
threw
his
hands
around
more.
even
after
he
was
handcuffed
and
the
officers
wanted
to
put
him
in
the
car,
the
undisputed
record
shows
that
he
was
vigorously
fighting
and
kicking,
resisting
getting
into
the
car,
and
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
both
commented
on
that.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
he
wasn't
arrested.
he
was
never
arrested.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
he
was
handcuffed
because
the
officers
were
concerned
that
he
was
a
criminal
suspect.
he
was
acting
in
a
very
unusual
and
erratic
way.
he
was
throwing
his
hands
around.
indeed,
the
district
court
stated
from
the
record
that
he
was
handcuffed
in
part
to
protect
himself,
as
well
as
the
officers.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
the
district
court
summarized
the
record
as
indicating
that.
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
the
record
either
supports
it
or
it
doesn't
but
the
district
court
did
say
that,
and
i
think
it
is
supported
by
the
record.
but
the
officers
also
were
entitled
to
protect
themselves;
to
maintain
control
of
the
situation;
to
secure
their
custody
of
the
petitioner.
they
didn't
have
to
wait
until
he
threatened
them.
they
didn't
have
to
wait
until
events
got
out
of
control.
the
circumstances
here,
that
he
was
a
criminal
suspect,
he
was
properly
stopped
for
investigation.
indeed,
petitioner's
own
expert
witness
at
trial
conceded
that
the
use
of
handcuffs
was
reasonable
and
appropriate
here.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
yes,
i
agree
there
was
a
seizure.
no
one
disputes
that.
the
petitioner
concedes
below
and
in
this
court
that
the
seizure
itself
was
proper
and
lawful.
that's
not
what
he
is
complaining
about.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
think
that's
not
correct.
the
record
shows
that
it
wasn't
until
he
was
in
the
car
that
for
the
first
time,
officer
connor
was
able
to
check
to
see
what
had
happened
at
the
convenience
store
and
determined
that
no
crime
had
been
committed.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
there
were
statements
to
them
that
he
was
a
diabetic.
i
don't
think
they
knew
one
way
or
the
other,
although
i
don't
think
that
particularly
matters
either.
even
if
he
was
a
diabetic,
and
his
complaint
is
that
he
wasn't
given
medical
treatment,
he
doesn't
allege
any
injuries
from
that.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that
didn't
result
from
the
diabetes.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
the
record
doesn't
show
how
his
foot
was
broken.
he
simply
failed
to
carry
his
burden
of
proof
to
show
that.
it
could
have
been
something
that
he
did
to
himself,
as
the
district
court
suggested,
or
it
could
have
resulted
from
the
officer's
reasonable
use
of
force.
there's
no
indication.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
but
the
plaintiff
in
this
case,
the
petitioner,
has
the
burden
of
putting
in
evidence
that
shows
its
more
probable
than
not.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
oh,
it's
entitled
to
infer
that
it
occurred
during
the
confrontation.
it's
not
entitled
to
infer,
we
don't
think,
that
it
was
caused
by
the
officers
through
any
wrongful
conduct.
as
i
say,
it
could
have
been
something
that
the
petitioner
did
to
himself
in
his
course
of
thrashing
around
and
resisting.
it
could
have
been
something
that
occurred
from
the
reasonable
use
of
force
by
the
officer.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
don't
think
they
are
in
this
case,
but
even
if
they
are,
there
still
is
no
jury
question
about
whether
the
officers
acted
unreasonably.
even
if
they
could
find
that
an
injury
resulted,
there
is
still
a
precedence
step
and
a
constitutional
step
about
whether
the
officers
did
anything
that
violated
the
4th
amendment.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
believe
there
were
five
in
total.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
it
is
not
uncommon,
although
it
is
very
similar
in
its
symptoms
to
drunkenness.
the
police
did
not
act
unreasonably
here
in
thinking
the
petitioner
might
be
drunk.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
there
is.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
these
officers
here
had
training
on
diabetics
and
one
officer
stated
that
based
on
her
experience
petitioner
was
not
acting
like
a
diabetic.
he
was
acting
like
a
drunk.
now,
she
may
have
made
a
mistake
in
that,
but
it
was
her
conclusion
at
the
time,
based
on
the
training
she
had
received.
i
would
cite
the
court
to
the
1st
circuit's
decision
in
compton
against--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--even
if
he
was
a
diabetic,
that
would
not
have
changed
the
officer's
actions
here.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well
at
first
they
wouldn't
have
known
that
he
was
desperately
in
need
of
orange
juice.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
not
clear
from
the
record,
and
even
if
they
knew
he
was
having
a
diabetic
problem
they
wouldn't
have
known
whether
it
was
caused
by
too
much
or
too
little
blood
sugar.
the
treatments
for
those
conditions
are
exactly
the
opposite,
and
by
guessing
wrong
they
could
have
done
more
harm
than
good.
petitioner
was
also
asked
twice
whether
he
wanted
to
go
to
the
hospital
or
needed
medical
assistance
and
he
said
no.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
his
companion
said,
mr.
berry
said,
that
he
didn't
know
what
was
wrong
with
petitioner.
it
might
be
a
blood
or
a
sugar
reaction;
that
he
had
never
seen
that
before;
that
he
was
scared;
that
he
didn't
know
what
to
do,
and
that
he
asked
for
officer
connor's
help
in
catching
petitioner
when
he
was
running
around
the
car.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
that's
not
what
happened
here
even
at
the
end.
they
took
him
home.
he
was
given
the
orange
juice
at
that
point.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
excuse
me?
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
believe
it
was
by
his
friend
who
had
brought
the
orange
juice.
but
the
police
didn't
interfere
with
his
getting
the
orange
juice
at
that
point.
he
was
freed.
they
removed
him
from
the
scene
not
because
they
were
arresting
him
but
because
a
crowd
had
gathered
and
was
getting
out
of
hand,
and
so
they
decided
to
remove
him.
but
the
conclusion
that
his
medical
problem
wasn't
urgent
and
could
be
deferred
until
he
was
secured
and
removed
from
this
hostile
scene
seems
to
us
to
be
reasonable,
in
light
of
his
own
statements
refusing
medical
assistance
and
saying
he
didn't
need
to
go
to
the
hospital.
in
view
of
his
physical
resistance;
in
view
of
the
crowd
that
was
gathering.
i
think
the
police,
while
perhaps
not
acting
perfectly...
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question...
but
i
can't
say
that
they
acted
unreasonably
here.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
think
it
is
not
relevant.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
if
the
seizure
itself
was
lawful--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--it
may
not
be
appropriate,
and
i
certainly
don't
defend
what
the
court
of
appeals
characterized--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--i
think
it
is
not
relevant
under
an
objective
standard,
the
4th
amendment.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
think
it
is.
now,
sometimes
the
police
officers
are
legitimately
entitled,
i
believe,
to
use
rough
language.
that
is
a
method
of
controlling
a
suspect
or
of
controlling
a
crowd.
there's
much
difference
between
asserting
their
authority
and
meekly
requesting
in
polite
language
that
the
suspect
do
anything.
i
don't
attempt
to
defend
some
of
the
language
that's
alleged
to
have
used
here,
but
we've
only
heard
one
side
of
the
case.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
what
they
did
at
that
point--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--they
put
him
in
the
car
and
they
removed
him
from
the
scene,
that's
what
they
did.
and
at
that
point
they--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--they
didn't
have
to
use
that
kind
of
language,
and
we
don't
defend
that
but
it's
not--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--but
even
if
it's
a
part
of
it...
and
i
don't
agree
with
that...
but
even
if
it
is,
it
is
not
a
constitutional
violation.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
the
record
doesn't
indicate.
it
only
indicates
that
berry
was
280
pounds.
but
remember,
when
the
police
stopped
the
car--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--i
don't
think
the
officers
here
maltreated
him.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
yes,
i
think
five
officers
can,
but
part
of
what
they
had
to
do--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--i
think
they
did.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
no.
i
don't
think
the
record
showed
that.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
he
was
resisting.
even
after
he
was
handcuffed,
justice
marshall,
the
undisputed
evidence
is
that
he
was
kicking
and
fighting,
resisting
getting
into
the
car.
the
officers
were
entitled
to
use
force
to
overcome
his
resistance,
even
if
it
meant,
as
he
characterizes
it,
throwing
him
into
the
car.
the
evidence
is
that
two
or
three
officers
stood
on
one
side
and
pushed
him
in
the
door.
one
officer
took
his
arm
from
the
other
side
and
pulled
him
through.
that
was
what
he
characterizes
as
throwing
him
in
the
car.
given
his
resistance,
even
after
he
was
handcuffed,
and
given
the
crowd
that
was
gathering
and
getting
out
of
hand
the
police
were
reasonable
in
deciding
that
they
needed
force
to
overcome
his
resistance
and
that
they
needed
to
get
him
into
the
car
quickly
and
out
of
the
hostile
environment.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
we
think
the
court
can
get
to
the
facts.
the
record
here
is
not
very
long.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
think
the
court
should
decide
it.
i
think
it
would
provide
helpful
guidance
to
lower
courts
if
the
court
not
only
enunciated
the
standard
but
applied
it
here.
the
record
in
this
case
is
about
100
pages
long.
it's
really
quite
short.
unfortunately,
some
important
material
is
not
contained
in
the
joint
appendix,
but
i
would
urge
the
court
to
read
the
record
if
it
decides
to
undertake
the
question
of
whether
the
directed
verdict
in
this
case
was
appropriately
entered.
but
to
follow
up
on
your
question,
justice
white,
even
if
you
think
the
4th
circuit's
general
standard
is
one
of
subjective
intent,
the
basis
for
the
holding
in
this
case
was
not
subjective.
both
of
the
decisions
below
turn
on
the
determination
that
the
officers
acted
with
objective
reasonableness
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
itself
said
that
a
directed
verdict
was
proper
because
"the
evidence
clearly
establishes
that
at
each
stage
of
the
incident
the
actions
of
the
officers
were
essentially
reasonable.
"
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
rule
for
respondents
here
on
the
theory
that
they
had
not
acted
maliciously
and
sadistically
in
using
unreasonable
force.
instead,
it
held
that
looking
to
the
need
for
an
amount
of
force
here,
the
use
of
force
simply
could
not
have
been
found
to
be
unreasonable
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
that's
the
objective
standard
the
petitioner
advocates.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
let
me
give
two
answers.
first,
at
most
that
would
go
to
the
question
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
thinks
the
general
standard
is,
not
necessarily
what
it
was
applying
in
this
case.
but
beyond
that,
it's
not
so
clear
to
me
that
the
8th
amendment
standard
under
whitley
isn't
a
subjective
standard.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
it's
different
in
its
words,
and
maybe
at
the
margin
it's
different.
it's
hard
to
know
exactly,
and
we
don't
necessarily
propose
that
the
court
adopt
the
same
words
as
the
4th
amendment
standard
here.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
no,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
defensible,
although
as
we
discussed
before
its
language
may
be
a
little
bit
ill-chosen
to
convey
the
sense
of
an
objective
test.
we
think
that's
what
they
were
doing,
and
maybe
more
precise
language
would
be
useful.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
think
the
problem
in
this
case,
or
in
whitley
against
albers,
or
in
garner,
is
to
formulate
a
constitutional
standard
that
allows...
that
accommodates
the
legitimate
need
of
law
enforcement
officers
to
use
force
on
the
one
hand,
but
doesn't
allow
them
to
use
force
that
is
simply
gratuitous
or
unrelated
to
any
legitimate
law
enforcement
need.
the
problem
is
basically
the
same
in
those
two
areas.
now
it
may
be
that
taking
the
context
into
account,
the
law
enforcement
officials
can
do
different
things
in
those
two
areas
in
balancing
the
two
competing
considerations,
but
the
underlying
problem
is
very
much
the
same.
an
example
may
help
to
illustrate
that.
if
the
prison
riot
that
occurred
in
whitley
had
occurred
at
a
pretrial
detention
center
like
the
mcc
in
new
york,
the
8th
amendment
wouldn't
have
applied
because
those
people
hadn't
yet
been
convicted
of
a
crime.
and
yet
riot
in
a
jail,
it
seems
to
me,
could
be
handled
in
precisely
the
same
way
that
the
riot
in
whitley
was
handled.
the
fact
that
the
jail
situation
would
be
analyzed
under
bell
against
wolfish
and
5th
amendment
substantive
due
process
terms,
whereas
the
whitley
situation
was
analyzed
in
8th
amendment
terms,
doesn't
really
change
very
much,
if
at
all,
the
real
issue
that's
before
the
courts
in
dealing
with
these
kinds
of
problems.
and
similarly,
in
the
4th
amendment
area,
the
question
again
is
what
is
a
reasonable
range
of
choice
for
police
officers
in
carrying
out
their
duties.
now,
the
test
we
would
propose...
and
it
differs
in
language
but
i
don't
think
in
philosophy
from
the
court
of
appeals...
is
this:
force
is
unreasonable
under
the
4th
amendment
if
it
is
clearly
excessive,
such
that
no
reasonably
competent
police
officer
could
have
thought
it
appropriate
because
it
was
arbitrary
in
relation
to
any
legitimate
law
enforcement
need.
in
other
words,
so
long
as
the
use
of
force
was
debatable
and
within
the
range
of
judgment
of
reasonable
police
officers,
it
is
not
a
federal
constitutional
tort.
and
we
think
that
is
in
sum
and
substance
very
much
what
the
court
of
appeals
was
getting
at
in
this
case.
it
was
trying
to
determine,
through
the
malicious
and
sadistic
standard,
when
the
use
of
force
was
appropriate
for
a
law
enforcement
need
on
the
one
hand,
or
when
it
wasn't.
when
it
was
simply
being
used,
to
quote
the
language,
maliciously
and
sadistically
for
the
very
purpose
of
inflicting
harm.
we
think
that
was
the
issue
the
court
was
grappling
with,
and
its
standard
drew
the
line
in
that
place.
now,
let
me
talk
a
little
bit
more
about
the
general
4th
amendment
standard.
we
don't
disagree
that
this
case
can
be
analyzed
in
4th
amendment
terms.
we
don't
disagree
that
the
4th
amendment
establishes
an
objective
reasonableness
test
judged
in
the
light
of
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
as
they
appeared
to
the
officers
at
the
time.
and
indeed,
the
4th
circuit
itself
recently
applied
an
objective
reasonableness
standard
under
the
4th
amendment
in
a
recent
decision
called
martin
v.
gentile,
which
is
reported
in
849
f.
2c.
we
do,
though,
strongly
disagree
with
the
way
in
which
petitioner
proposes
that
the
4th
amendment
test
be
understood
and
implemented.
now,
it
is
axiomatic,
we
think,
that
the
use
of
force
is
a
necessary
and
unavoidable
part
of
police
work,
including
arrests
and
stops.
as
the
north
carolina
amicus
brief
explains,
police
daily
confront
dangerous,
often
violent
situations
that
require
split-second
judgments
on
the
scene,
in
difficult,
uncertain
and
fast-changing
circumstances
that
pose
serious
risks
and
injury
or
even
death
to
the
police
officers
and
others.
it
should
be
recognized
that
there
is
a
range
of
actions
that
would
be
reasonable
for
the
police
to
take
in
light
of
their
appraisal
on
the
scene,
on
the
spot
of
the
ambiguous
and
changing
circumstances
as
they
see
them.
it's
important
that
not
every
state
battery
claim
against
the
police
official
be
converted
into
a
federal
lawsuit
under
section
1983.
not
every
battery
becomes
a
federal
constitutional
case
simply
because
the
defendant
is
a
police
officer.
in
judging
the
actions
of
the
police
officers
it
is
also
important
that
they
not
be...
not
be
looked
at
in
hindsight
in
the
calm
of
the
courtroom
to
determine
whether
the
officers
acted
in
the
best
possible
way,
or
whether
they
used
no
more
force
than
we
can
now
see
was
absolutely
necessary
in
the
circumstances.
and
that's
basically
what
petitioner's
test
proposes.
his
standard
is
the
hypothetical
reasonable
police
officer.
the
force
is
excessive
if
the
hypothetical
police
officer
would
not
have
thought
that
it
was
reasonably
required
and
necessary
in
the
circumstances,
and
that
language...
reasonably
required
and
necessary...
is
contained
in
petitioner's
brief
on
pages
25
and
36.
now,
petitioner
of
course
pays
lip
service
to
the
concerns
that
i
raise,
but
it's
clear
from
the
way
he
would
apply
his
test
in
this
case
that
he
doesn't
really
mean
them.
his
test
would
enshrine
the
restatement
of
torts
in
the
constitution,
and
would
convert
every
battery
case
against
the
police
officer
under
state
law
into
a
federal
cause
of
action.
i
read
his
brief,
i've
listened
to
his
argument,
and
he
proposes
no
principle...
no
basis...
for
saying
that
some
battery
actions
fall
only
under
state
law
and
distinguishing
those
that
he
says
would
be
a
federal
constitutional
case.
every
such
arrest
that
involves
the
use
of
force
is
a
potential
federal
civil
rights
case
under
his
proposed
test.
every
claim
that
the
police
officers
used
more
force
than
was
necessary...
that
is,
they
were
appropriately
using
some
force,
but
simply
used
more
than
they
reasonably
should
have,
would
state
a
federal
cause
of
action.
every
contention
that
a
suspect
was
thrown
a
little
bit
too
hard
against
a
wall,
or
that
an
officer's
grip
on
a
suspect
was
a
little
too
hard--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--well,
he
was
a
diabetic
as
we
now
know,
but
he
was
also
a
criminal
suspect
who
was
acting
very
suspiciously
and
erratically.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
and
he
was
never
arrested
here.
there's
no
question
about
his
guilt.
but
he
was
a
suspect.
he
was
acting
erratically,
he
was
physically
resisting
the
officers.
we
think
his
treatment
here
was
not
a
constitutional
violation
in
any
respect.
now,
there's
one
part
of
petitioner's
test
that
i'd
like
to
comment
on
specifically.
as
the
solicitor
general's
brief
makes
clear,
petitioner's
test
calls
for
a
comparison
between
the
police
officer's
conduct
and
any
less
forcible
alternatives
that
they
might
have
used
in
the
circumstances.
that's
a
least
drastic
means
test,
and
we
think
it's
wholly
out
of
place
in
this
context
and
inconsistent
with
this
court's
decisions
in
whitley
against
albers,
in
bell
against
wolfish
and
most
particularly
in
martinez
fuerte,
which
was
itself
a
4th
amendment
case.
a
reasonable
governmental
action
does
not
become
unreasonable
simply
because
the
police
did
not
take
the
best
possible
option.
at
least
so
long
as
the
choices
were
within
the
ranges
of
debatable
alternatives,
the
fact
that
the
best
one
is
not
selected
does
not
render
the
choice
made
unconstitutional.
another
problem
with
the
petitioner's
least
drastic
means
approach
is
that
it
practically
invites
the
jury
to
second-guess
the
actions
of
the
police
officers
and
to
substitute
its
judgment
for
theirs
as
to
what
should
have
happened.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
it
could
be
characterized
that
way.
it
does
draw
on
that,
as
well
as
the
4th
amendment
notion
of
reasonableness,
but
we
think
that
really
is
the
core
inquiry
here.
when
is
it
reasonable,
when
is
it
rational
for
police
to
use
the
force
that
they
did
in
the
way
that
they
did,
or
when
was
it
unrelated
to
some
legitimate
law
enforcement
need?
and
i
don't
know
that
juries
are
going
to
be
very
good
at
making
that
determination.
they're
going
to
be
presented
with
alternatives
by
plaintiff's
expert
witness
at
trial.
they're
going
to
be
deliberating
this
in
the
calm
hindsight
of
the
courtroom,
and
it's
going
to
be
all
too
easy
for
them
to
conclude
that
it
would
have
been
better
for
the
police
to
have
acted
differently,
and
that
should
not
be
the
constitutional
standard
and
it
should
not
be
left
to
the
juries
to
decide.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
it
is
quite
different,
and
there
is
no
immunity
issue
in
this
case
because
by
oversight
it
was
failed
to
be
raised
below.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
the
application
of
immunity
doctrine
here
is
not
at
all
clear.
in
some
respects,
it's
like
anderson
against
creighton,
and
we
think
whatever
the
standard
is,
there
would
be
room
for
an
immunity
defense.
but
in
whitley
against
albers
and
in
daniel;
against
williams,
the
court
didn't
refrain
to
decide
the
liability
issue
because
there
might
be
an
immunity
defense.
liability
is
the
logically
antecedent
question
and
there
are
reasons
why
the
court
shouldn't
want
all
its
bases.
