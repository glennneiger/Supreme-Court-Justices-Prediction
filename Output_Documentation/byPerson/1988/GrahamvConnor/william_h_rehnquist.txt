mr.
beaver,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
beaver,
don't
you
understand
that
your
opponents
here
concede
that
the
4th
amendment
is
the
correct
mode
of
analysis
for
these
facts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wouldn't
the
officer
at
least
have
to
intend
to
seize
the
person.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
beaver.
mr.
levy,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
interrupt
you
for
just
a
moment.
do
you
agree
that
this
case
should
be
decided
under
4th
amendment
principles?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
should
be?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
that
really
a
jury
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
you're
sure
that
your
foot
was
okay
before
this
sort
of
a
fracas
and
it's
broken
afterwards,
isn't
the
jury
entitled
to
infer
that
it
was
a
result
of
this
confrontation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
don't
think
those
are
jury
questions?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
levy.
mr.
beaver,
do
you
have
any
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
beaver.
the
case
is
submitted.
