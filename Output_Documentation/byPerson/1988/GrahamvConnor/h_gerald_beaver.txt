mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court:
on
november
12,
1984,
dethorne
graham
was
not
a
convict
or
a
criminal.
he
was
not
a
pretrial
detainee.
indeed,
he
was
not
even
a
formal
arrestee.
he
was
a
free
citizen
of
the
united
states
of
america
who
on
that
day
had
an
insulin
reaction,
and
he
called
upon
a
friend
to
take
him
to
a
convenience
store
where
he
could
purchase
some
orange
juice
to
help
counteract
the
effect
of
the
insulin
reaction.
upon
arriving
there,
he
noted
that
because
of
a
line
it
would
take
him
a
long
time
to
get
his
orange
juice,
and
he
became
concerned
and
ran
to
his
friend's
car
and
motioned
for
him
to
take
him
to
his
girlfriend's
house.
a
charlotte,
north
carolina
police
officer
saw
him
hurriedly
exit
the
convenience
store
and
determined
the
conditions
to
be
suspicious
enough
to
allow
for
a
brief
investigative
stop
to
determine
the
facts.
upon
making
this
stop,
mr.
berry
immediately
informed
officer
connor
that
mr.
graham
was
indeed
suffering
from
what
he
described
as
a
sugar
reaction.
at
this
time
officer
connor
asked
mr.
berry,
or
told
mr.
berry,
that
he
must
remain
with
mr.
graham
at
that
time
while
he
determined
what
happened
at
the
convenience
store,
and
he
began
to
depart.
at
this
time
the
petitioner
became
concerned,
and
according
to
his
testimony
he
has
little
memory
of
what
occurred,
most
likely
because
of
the
continuation
of
his
insulin
reaction.
he
exited
the
car
and
ran
around
it
twice,
and
then
sat
down
on
the
curb.
from
this
point
forward,
taking
the
evidence
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
petitioner,
as
must
be
done
on
a
directed
verdict,
he
was
seated
at
that
time,
again
peacefully
talking
with
the
police
officers
when
back-up
officers
arrived.
we
know
that
those
officers
must
have
been
told
of
the
alleged
sugar
reaction
before
the
first
comment.
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
he
was
sitting
on
the
curb.
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
yes,
he
was
at
that
time.
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
yes,
he
had
been
conscious,
but
he
has
not
memory
of
those
events.
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
he
was
talking
to
mr.
berry
and
to
officer
connor
at
that
time,
when
the
back-up
officers
arrived,
and
we
can
tell
by
the
comment
of
the
first
arriving
officer
that
they
were
explained
about
the
sugar
reaction
because
the
first
comment
was,
"i've
seen
a
lot
of
people
with
sugar
diabetes
before
but
none
that
ever
acted
like
this.
"
"there
must
be...
he
must
be
drunk.
"
"let's
lock
him
up.
"
and
they
grabbed
him,
and
they
turned
him
over
and
they
handcuffed
him
very
tightly,
so
tightly
that
at
the
conclusion
of
this
episode
he
had
cut
wrists;
and
they
lifted
him
up
by
his
arms
and
they
carried
him
to
the
hood
of
mr.
berry's
car
and
laid
him
over
it.
at
this
time,
he
regained
his
senses
and
began
to
talk
with
the
officers
and
complain
about
the
treatment
he
was
receiving,
and
he
asked
them
to
please
check
his
back
pocket
for
his
diabetic
decal
to
show
that
he
was
indeed
a
diabetic.
the
response
was,
an
officer
told
him
to
shut
up
and
slammed
his
head
into
the
hood
of
the
police
car...
or,
i'm
sorry,
mr.
berry's
car.
a
few
moments
later,
no
less
than
four
police
officers
grabbed
mr.
graham,
one
on
each
arm,
one
on
each
leg,
picked
him
physically
off
the
ground,
carried
him
to
a
police
car,
opened
the
back
door
and
threw
him
in,
to
use
the
petitioner's
words,
like
he
was
a
sack
of
potatoes,
and
they
drove
him
home...
never
arrested
him.
when
he
arrived
home
they
unhandcuffed
him
and
he
fell
flat
on
the
ground,
and
he
was
carried
within
a
few
moments
for
medical
attention
and
the
examining
physician
discovered
he
had
a
broken
foot.
he
in
fact
had
an
insulin
reaction.
his
blood
sugar
count
was
very
low;
and
they
discovered
that
he
had
cut
wrists
and
he
had
a
large
abrasion
over
his
right
eye.
he
had
an
injured
right
shoulder
that
prohibited
him
to
the
extent
that
for
two
weeks
he
could
not
administer
his
own
insulin
shots.
he
missed
five
and
a
half
weeks
of
work
at
the
north
carolina
department
of
transportation.
he
incurred
medical
expenses.
all
as
a
result
of
this.
on
these
facts,
the
lower
courts
on
a
directed
verdict
held
that
these
acts
by
the
police
officers
had
violated
no
constitutional
right
of
mr.
graham
to
be
free
from
bodily
harm
and
physical
abuse
at
the
hands
of
law
enforcement
officers.
may
it
please
the
court,
this
decision
is
wrong,
and
it
is
wrong
for
four
reasons.
initially
it
is
wrong
because
it
fails
to
understand
that
whenever
force--
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
--i'm
talking
about
the
district
court
decision
and
the
4th
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
we
are,
sir.
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
the
4th
circuit
united
states
court
of
appeals,
we
contend,
created
a
generic
hybrid
type
of
constitutional
right
with
no
specific
provision
as
to
what
the
constitutional
anchor
for
the
analysis
is.
they
permitted
the
consideration
of
the
subjective
intent
of
the
officers
when
it
is
our
contention
that
two
decades
of
4th
amendment
jurisprudence
of
this
court
forbids
such
an
analysis.
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
yes,
sir.
they
are
wrong
because
they
failed
to
understand
that
whenever
force
is
used
by
officers
to
seize
a
citizen,
the
4th
amendment,
by
its
very
own
terms
preventing,
or
prohibiting
unreasonable
search
and
seizure,
controls
analysis.
the
decision
is
wrong
because
it
fails
to
apply
the
principles
that
were
laid
down
by
this
court
in
tennessee
v.
garner,
an
objective
standard
of
reasonableness
test
to
analyze
this
situation.
it
was
wrong
because
it
suggests
contrary
to
two
decades
of
4th
amendment
jurisprudence,
beginning
in
1967
with
this
court's
decision
in
the
schmarber
case,
that
at
a
minimum
the
4th
circuit
held
that
it
was
relevant
to
consider,
at
a
minimum
that
it
was
relevant
to
consider,
not
only
was
the
officer's
conduct
unreasonable,
but
whether
the
officer
inflicted
pain
on
the
citizen
maliciously,
sadistically,
for
the
very
purpose
of
causing
harm.
the
4th
amendment
forbids
that,
tennessee
v.
garner
and
terry
v.
ohio
tell
us.
and
finally,
the
decision
was
wrong
because
the
court
below
erred
as
a
matter
of
law
in
resolving
credibility
issues,
weighing
testimony,
determining
credibility
in
the
light
not
most
favorable
to
the
petitioner
and
drawing
unfavorable
inferences
in
deciding
and
affirming
its
directed
verdict.
initially,
all
parties
in
briefs
concede
that
the
petitioner
was
seized
in
this
case,
when
officer
connor
informed
the
petitioner
and
berry
that
they
were
not
free
to
leave.
however,
the
inquiry
was
not
stopped
there,
for
we
are
told
in
terry
v.
ohio
that
a
seizure
which
is
reasonable
at
its
inception
may
violate
the
4th
amendment
by
virtue
of
its
intolerable
intensity
and
scope.
to
quote
this
court
in
tennessee
v.
garner,
reasonableness
depends
not
only
when
a
seizure
is
made,
but
also
how
it
is
carried
out.
tennessee
v.
garner
relied
upon
two
decades
of
4th
amendment
jurisprudence
of
this
court
and
analyzed
an
officer's
use
of
force
in
seizing
a
suspect
from
an
objective
standard
of
reasonableness.
may
it
please
the
court,
tennessee
v.
garner
logically
controls
the
disposition
of
this
claim
just
as
terry
and
its
progeny
controls
the
framework
of
tennessee
v.
garner.
inexplicably,
the
4th
circuit
court
of
appeal
fails
to
even
cite
or
mention
tennessee
v.
garner
or
the
objective
standard
of
reasonableness
and
instead
embarks
upon
a
determination
of
the
petitioner's
claim
based
upon
a
substantive
due
process
concept
which
was
first
formulated
by
the
2nd
circuit
in
its
1973
decision
in
johnson
v.
glick.
in
glick,
relying
upon
this
court's
1952
decision
in
rochin
v.
california,
the
2nd
circuit
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
due
process
clause
protects
criminal
suspects
from
police
conduct
that
shocks
the
conscience.
but
of
course,
rochin,
the
analytical
predecessor
of
glick,
predated
mapp
v.
ohio,
and
at
that
time,
at
the
time
rochin
was
decided
the
4th
amendment
was
not
a
part
of
the
constitution
made
applicable
to
the
states.
nonetheless,
judge
friendly
announced
four
tests
to
be
used
in
analyzing
this'shock
the
conscience'
test,
the
fourth
of
which
was
a
wholly
subjective
factor
of
whether
the
force
was
applied
in
a
good
faith
effort
to
maintain
or
restore
discipline,
or
maliciously
and
sadistically
for
the
very
purpose
of
causing
harm.
these
factors
have
since
been
used
by
a
number
of
circuits
including
the
one
below
to
analyze
excessive
force
claims.
however,
we
submit
that
the
continued
use
of
this
substantive
glick
test,
and
particularly
its
fourth
factor,
in
seizure
and
arrest
cases,
is
patently
at
odds
with
the
express
words
of
the
4th
amendment
and
the
holdings
of
this
court.
and
that
is
for
four
reasons.
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
i
understand
that
they
do
so
in
their
brief,
sir.
yes,
sir,
i
do
that.
but
what
they
do
not
concede
is
that...
they
would
have
this
court
believe,
and
the
4th
circuit
would
hold,
that
its
decision
which
relied
upon
the
four
glick
factors
and
discussed
the
four
glick
factors,
it
would
have
us
believe
that
that
is
simply
another
way
of
stating
objective
standard
of
reasonableness,
and
it
is
not.
objective
standard
of
reasonableness
forbids,
strictly
forbids
a
look
at
subjective
intent,
and
the
reason
for
this
is
it
is
irrelevant.
it
is
irrelevant
to
an
objective
4th
amendment
consideration.
two
examples:
tennessee
v.
garner
is
a
prime
example
of
why
it
is
irrelevant.
in
that
case,
clearly
a
majority
of
this
court
held
that
the
conduct
engaged
upon
by
the
officers
was
objectively
unreasonable.
however,
this
court...
the
courts
below
when
it
was
never
raised,
the
officer
there
clearly
acted
with
a
benign
intent.
he
was
not
in
any
way
malicious
or
sadistic
or
acting
for
the
purposes
of--
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
--it
does
not
under
this
court's
decision
in
harlow
v.
fitzgerald
where
a
subjective...
this
court
has
driven
subjective
considerations
from
every
aspect
of
4th
amendment
analysis.
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
oh,
no.
they
are
simply
not
the
same.
tennessee
v.
garner
is
a
prime
example
of
why
it's
not
the
same.
tennessee
v.
garner,
the
conduct
was
held
clearly
to
be
objectively
unreasonable
at
the
same
time
it
was
held
to
be
within
qualified
good
faith--
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
--because
of
reliance
upon
the
bright
line
test--
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
--i
would
think
not,
but
with
all
due
respect
there
was
no
raising
of
the
qualified
good
faith
immunity
defense
in
this
case.
it
was
never
presented
either
by
pleadings
or
in
argument
before
the
district
court
or
before
the
appellate
court.
it
was
never
raised.
it's
simply
not
an
issue
in
the
matter.
hypothetically,
i
can
see
no
reason
why
this
case
would
be
any
different
with
tennessee
v.
garner.
i
think
it
clearly
violates...
can
be
argued
clearly
that
it
violates
bright
lyon
standards
to
take
a
handcuffed
man
who
merely
asked
you
to
look
into
his
diabetic
decal,
grab
him
on
the
back
of
the
head
and
slam
his
head
into
the
hood
of
a
car.
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
yes.
and
my
i
explain...
or
may
i
take
one
little
caveat
to
that.
i
recall
your
footnote
13,
i
believe
it
was
in
united
states
v.
scott,
in
which
you
were
talking
about...
this
is
the
case
involving
the
wire
taps...
in
which
you
indicated
that
perhaps
such
bad
faith
statements
could
be
usable
by
the
court
in
the
criminal
context,
for
example,
to
determine
whether
the
exclusionary
rule
should
apply.
it
can
also
be
used
in
the
civil
context
to
look
into
credibility
issues
for
jury
determination
if
the
officer
is
acting
objectively
malicious
by
his
statements.
clearly
a
jury
can
consider
that
in
determining
the
credibility
of
him
taking
the
stand
and
saying
that
things
occurred
in
a
different
way.
and
finally,
in
a
civil
context
it's
also
useful
for
punitive
damages
questions.
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
other
than
perhaps
in
a
decision
by
the
jury
whether
to
award
punitive
damages.
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
i
see.
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
i
believe
that
a
pretextual
stop
is
not
objectively
reasonable,
if
that
makes
sense.
to
arrest
someone
and
seize
them
on
a
pretext
i
think
from
an
objective
point
of
view
can
be
argued
is--
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
--let
me
back
up
and
say,
strictly
speaking
with
the
objective
test
i
would
agree
with
you,
with
the
justice.
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
--oh,
i'm
certain
that
there
are
many
cases
where
there
is
an
objectively
unreasonable
seizure--
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
--tennessee
v.
garner
is
a
prime
example.
it
was
good
faith
and
the
seizure
was
unreasonable.
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
put
on
the
spot
it
is
very
difficult
for
me
to
think
of
hypotheticals.
i
would
certainly
think
that
there
are
a
number
of
situations
cited
in
our
briefs,
both
ours
and
the
solicitor
general,
as
amicus,
and
i
do
not
recall
them
specifically
in
my
mind
at
this
time
and
i
apologize.
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
pardon
me.
i
cannot
think
of
one
at
this
time.
there
are
numerous
hypotheticals
set
forth
in
both
our
brief
and
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general
as
amicus.
if
i
may
i
would
defer
to
those
briefs
and
i
apologize
for
not
being
able
to
come
up
with
one
at
this
moment.
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
well,
i
believe
that
i
stated
that--
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
--that's
correct,
and
i
have
since
rescinded
that
in
speaking
with
the
justice
as
stated,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
that
would
be
a
situation.
i
think
a
pretextual
stop
would
not
necessarily
be
objectionably
unreasonable.
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
it
would
not
be
objectively
unreasonable.
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
right.
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
may
i
state,
sir,
that
this
is
not
my
rule.
this
is
the
rule
from
tennessee
v.
garner
and
20
years
of
objective
jurisprudence.
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument
i
believe
that
i
would,
yes
sir.
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
well,
i
might
not.
it
depends
on
who
my
client
is,
your
honor.
assuming,
then,
that
the
4th
amendment
applies,
the
court
below
erred
in
considering
either
as
an
element
of
the
petitioner's
claim
or
as
a
conceptual
factor,
however
that
is
defined
by
the
4th
circuit
court
of
appeals,
the
subjective
intent
of
the
officers.
first
of
all,
section
1983
this
court
has
on
numerous
occasions
has
held
contains
no
state
of
mind
requirement,
and
one
must
focus
on
the
specific
constitutional
amendment
itself.
as
this
court
has
held
in
tennessee
v.
garner
and
in
terry
v.
ohio
and
other
earlier
cases,
the
4th
amendment
calls
for
this
objective
standard.
the
4th
amendment
does
not
prohibit
malicious
and
sadistic
seizures
or
seizures
that
are
accompanied
by
severe
injury.
it
prohibits
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures,
and
as
i
stated
i
believe
firmly
that
the
subjective
intent
of
the
officers
in
making
a
seizure
is
a
wholly
irrelevant
factor.
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
yes.
under...
this
sounds
as
if
your
honor
is
asking
whether
there
must
be
an
intentional
act
to
predicate
this
test,
and
we
certainly
are
willing
to
concede
that
this
case
does
not
imply
anything
about
unintended
acts
creating
unintended
injuries.
this
case
is
no
more
involved
with
that
type
of
situation
than
tennessee
v.
garner
was.
i
believe
that
what
the
4th
circuit
opinion
does,
we
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
or
i
mentioned
the
hybrid
test
which
is
not
specifically
set
to
any
particular
constitutional
amendment.
yet
if
you
tell
a
jury,
in
instructing
the
jury,
that
they
should
consider
the
subjective
intent
of
an
officer,
you're
going
to
end
up
with
many
jury
verdicts
in
which
the
jury
says
well,
the
person
was
not
being
malicious
or
sadistic
therefore
we
should
not
find
against
him.
as
mentioned
earlier,
this
court
has
driven
subjective
considerations
even
from
the
good
faith
defense.
it
goes
even
further
in
the
last
term
in
michigan
v.
chesternut,
this
court
drove
the
any
subjective
intent
requirements
out
of
the
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
a
person
felt
that
he
was
seized.
the
court
held
in
michigan
v.
chesternut
that
a
person
is
seized
when
he,
when
an
objective
person,
when
a
reasonable
person
under
the
circumstances
would
not
feel
that
he
was
wrong.
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
we
would
argue
the
case
should
be
reversed
and
sent
back
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
yes.
or
at
a
minimum,
new
findings
under
the
correct
standard.
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
may
it
please
the
court,
the
decision
on
directed
verdict
is
a
question
of
law.
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals,
for
that
matter
this
court,
has
no
discretion
in
how
to
determine
the
facts
here.
the
facts
are
to
be
determined
in
the
light
most
favorable,
and
this
court
as
well
as,
is
in
as
good
a
position
as
any
court,
to
read
the
bare
record
and
determine
what
is
the
light
most
reasonable...
most
favorable
to
the
petitioner.
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
that
is
one
option
for
this
court.
we,
however,
believe
that
this
court
is
in
as
good
a
position
to
make
that
decision
and
that
clearly,
clearly
there
is
evidence
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
petitioner.
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
i
presume
the
justice
has
studied
the
record
and
is
familiar
with
the
facts.
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
no,
not
in
every
case.
personally
i've
tried
two
cases
in
which
a
court
has
told
the
jury
if
they
find
it
in
the
way
that
the
plaintiff
has
contended
things
occurred
they
would
find
for
the
plaintiff.
if
they
found
it
in
the
way
the
defense
said...
there
are
some
cases
which
are
clear.
there
are
other
cases
which
it
is
a
jury
question,
when
they
have
to
resolve
conflicts.
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
in
my
opinion,
in
this
case,
were
there
no
other
side
to
be
heard,
yes,
under
an
objective
reasonableness
test.
you
don't
even
treat
arrestees
like
this.
this
is
a
terry
stop
that
got
out
of
control,
as
a
matter
of
law,
without
hearing
from
the
other
side.
but
there
is
another
side
to
be
heard.
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
direct
the
verdict
in
our
favor.
clearly,
clearly
they
have
the
opportunity
to
present
their
evidence
and
to
make
their
arguments.
the
problem
with
this
case
is
that
the
4th
circuit
opinion,
and
i
repeat,
allows...
at
least
allows,
if
not
requires...
the
consideration
of
subjective
intent.
the
4th
amendment
forbids
it.
thank
you.
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
very
briefly,
if
i
might,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
again
may
it
please
the
court.
speaking
of
this
hostile
environment.
it
was
not
a
hostile
environment
to
my
client.
he
was
amongst
friends.
it
was
hostile,
perhaps,
to
the
police
officers
who
were
abusing
him.
the
point
i'm
getting
at
is,
i
don't
believe
the
police
can
create
their
own
exigency
and
then
complain
that
they
had
to
use
force
against
someone
to
get
themselves
out
of
the
exigency
that
they
have
created
by
their
own
objectively
unreasonable
behavior.
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
if
i
may,
sir,
get
fact-specific,
justice:
under
the
case
in
the
direct
examination
of
mr.
berry,
he
was
directly
asked
whether
at
any
time
he
saw
the
petitioner
kicking
or
waving
his
arms
around
or
resisting
in
any
way.
he
stated
he
was
there
throughout
the
entire
transaction
and
at
no
time
did
this
occur.
he
did
state
on
cross-examination
that
on
a
time
or
two
the
petitioner
protested
against
his
treatment
and
pulled
his
arms
away.
mr.
h.
gerald
beaver
there
was
testimony
from
another
police
officer
that
he
did
that,
but
we
are
not
bound
by
the
credibility
of
a
police
officer
that
we
call
for
adverse
examination
under
the
federal
rules
of
evidence,
your
honor.
we've
heard
these
cries
of
wolf,
that
if
such
a
standard
were
to
be
adopted
the
floodgates
would
be
let
down,
before.
but
to
be
quite
candid,
there
are
a
mountain
of
problems
bringing
cases
such
as
this.
the
monell
doctrine
prohibits
bringing
other
than
the
most
egregious,
clearest
policy,
practice
and
procedure
cases
against
municipalities.
qualified
good
faith
immunity
protects
officers
much
as
justice
scalia
has
just
correctly
discussed.
it
is
easy
to
confuse
the
objective
standard
of
reasonableness
and
qualified
good
faith
immunity.
it
is
a
substantial
protection
for
police
officers
who
act
with
objective
good
faith
in
their
activities.
the
detura
decision
issued
by
this
court
two
years
ago,
which
prohibited
the
awarding
of
substantial
damages
on
the
basis
of
violation
of
constitutional
rights
alone
without
any
regard
whatsoever
for
physical
injury,
would
certainly
deter
the
bringing
of
most
de
minimus
lawsuits.
and
having
practiced
in
the
united
states
district
courts
in
these
type
of
cases,
may
i
say
we
are
acutely
aware
of
the
requirements
of
rule
11,
and
we
are
going
to
be
absolutely
certain
of
our
cases
before
they
are
pled
and
they
are
brought.
turning
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
again
i
believe
that
my
opponent
continues
to
misjudge
the
standard
of
evidence
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
petitioner.
he
states
that
our
own
expert
testified
that
the
seizure
was
appropriate,
but
if
you
will
look
closely
at
the
record
you
will
find
that
this
testimony
occurred
during
a
voir
dire
hearing,
if
i'm
correct,
as
to
his
expertise
in
which
he
was
posed
a
hypothetical
question
which
he
did
not
posit
with
any
and
all
of
the
facts
subsequently
brought
into
the
case.
and
at
another
time,
when
presented
another
hypothetical
case,
with
all
the...
hypothetical
question...
with
all
the
pertinent
factors
in,
stated
that
in
his
opinion
the
seizure
of
the
petitioner
was
improper.
my
opponent
in
this
matter
would
have
this
court
imply
or
approve
an
objective
standard
of
reasonableness
but
something
else
test.
that
something
else,
we
don't
know
exactly
what
it
is.
it's
somewhere
between
the
8th
amendment
requirement
and
the
objective
standard
of
reasonableness.
this
court
clearly
has
never
applied
subjective
factors
such
as
here,
except
in
the
albers
situation.
that
case
has
been
recently,
and
that
decision...
that
malicious
and
sadistic,
an
intent
to
harm...
has
been
recently
reaffirmed
by
this
court
no
later
today,
and
the
decision
to
deny
certiorari
in
the
case
of
dudley
v.
stubbs.
there
justice
o'connor,
even
for
speaking
in
dissent,
for
the
three
justices
in
dissent,
clearly
recognizes
there
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
willful
indifference
test
in
the
nonriot
situation
and
the
substantive
condition
in
the
prison
riot
situation.
the
only
purposes
of
the
dissent
is
to
say
in
that
factual
circumstance
the
dissenters
feel
that
sufficient
evidence
was
presented
of
a
prison
riot-type
situation.
there
is
absolutely
no
reason,
as
judge
butzner
says
in
his
dissent,
and
this
court
has
never
at
any
time
even
hinted,
that
the
substantial
wall
against
liability
created
in
cases
involving
convicted
prisoners
should
be
applied
to
free
and
innocent
citizens.
we
ask
you
not
to
apply
such
a
standard.
