counsel,
under
the
objective
approach,
or
test,
that
you
propose,
i
assume
that
statements
made
by
the
officers
during
the
course
of
the
arrest
that
might
indicate
personal
animus
would
be
irrelevant.
justice

then.
it
would
appear
that
the
officer's
statements
would
have
no
relevance.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
some
of
the
circuits
have
applied
a
pretextual
seizure
doctrine.
for
instance,
a
traffic
arrest
is
made,
and
it
may
be
unreasonable
even
though
the
officer
had
probable
cause,
if
in
fact
the
officer
was
trying
to
make
a
drug
arrest,
for
example.
there
are
cases
involving
pretextual
seizures.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
your
objective
standard
would
preclude
that
kind
of
an
analysis?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
wouldn't
look
at
the
officer's
true
intent
under
your
theory.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
inference
is
of
intent.
i
mean,
the
normal
meaning
of
those
terms
is
addressed
to
the
intent
of
the
actor,
and
there
may
be
objective
circumstances
that
give
rise
to
an
inference,
but
i
think
the
normal
use
would
indicate
subjective
intent.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
would
normally
be
used
that
way,
and
i
don't
know
that
i
can
read
the
court
of
appeals
language
as
imposing
some
objective
standard
out
there
by
the
use
of
those
words.
it
looked
very
much
like
they
were
kind
of
adopting
a
sort
of
whitley
v.
albers
standard
for
review
of
what
occurred
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
levy,
i
guess
at
the
time
the
officers
finally
put
the
petitioner
in
the
wagon
they
were
aware
that
no
crime
had
occurred
in
the
convenience
market.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
were
they
aware
he
was
a
diabetic
at
the
time
he
was
lifted
into
the
wagon.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let's
see.
he
alleges
his
foot
was
broken.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
from
being
lifted
into
the
wagon.
