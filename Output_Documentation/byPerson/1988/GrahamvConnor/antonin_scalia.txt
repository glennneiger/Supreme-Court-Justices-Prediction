mr.
beaver,
you
have
to
run
that
one
by
me
again,
where
you
said
that
you
cannot
conceive
of
how,
you
say,
a
pretextual
stop
is
always
objectively
unreasonable.
i
think
we're
playing
with
words
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
know
it's
objectively
unreasonable
unless
you
know
what
the
subjective
intent
of
the
officers
is.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
not
at
all
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you'd
be
willing
to
apply
your
rule
consistently,
so
you
can
make
as
many
pretextual
stops
as
you
want.
justice
antonin
scalia
without
violating
the
4th
amendment.
justice
antonin
scalia
whatever.
you
would
still
apply
it
consistently,
though,
and
you'd
think
that
pretextual
stops
are
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
next
argument,
you
wouldn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
this
on
the
theory
that
words
mean
precisely
what
we
intend
them
to
mean
and
nothing
else?
that's
a
very
strange
way
to
use
those
words,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
for
example?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
malice
standard
is
objective?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
you're
conflating
the
4th
amendment
test
with
a
test
for
official
immunity.
i
mean,
we
could
adopt
a
tighter
test
for
the
4th
amendment.
that
is
the
test
that
your
opponent
explicitly
espouses.
was
it
more
force
than
was
necessary,
period.
if
it
was,
it's
a
4th
amendment
violation.
whether
the
policeman
is
liable
for
it,
on
the
other
hand,
would
depend
upon
whether
a
reasonable
policeman
could
have
believed
that
he
was
using
no
more
than
was
necessary.
the
issue
of
immunity
is
quite
different
from
the
issue
of
whether
there
has
been
a
4th
amendment
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
don't
make
us
distort
the
law
to
cover
that
oversight.
