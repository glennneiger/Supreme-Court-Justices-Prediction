justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
he
doing
when
the
officers
arrived?
he
was
sitting
on
the
curb.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
he
conscious?
justice
byron
r.
white
had
he
been?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
whom
was
he
talking?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
what
court
decision
are
you
talking
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
we're
reviewing
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
it
hold?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
saying
they
applied
the
wrong
rule
of
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
we
agree
with
you
that
the
court
of
appeals
used
the
wrong
standard?
what
should
we
do?
i
know
you
want
us
to
reverse,
but--
justice
byron
r.
white
--for
a
new
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
in
the
court
of
appeals,
they
ought
to
review
the,
what
the
district
court
did
under
the
right
standard?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
they
reviewed
the
directed
verdict
judgment
under
the
wrong
standard
why
shouldn't
we
just
send
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
say,
you
should
fly
the
right
standard?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
we
have
to
study
the
record
and
know
all
the
facts...
that's
a
lot
of
work.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
levy,
suppose
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
applied
the
wrong
standard;
that
they
did
not
apply
an
objective
standard
and
that
the
objective
standard
is
the
proper
one.
shouldn't
we
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals
without
getting
to
the
facts,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
of
course
we
can.
what
do
think
we
ought
to
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
was
undisputed
that
really
the
evidence
showed
that
your
client
was
being
very
active
sitting
on
the
curb,
and
that
he
was
having
to
be
restrained
by
his
friend
and
an
officer.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
was
testimony
that
he
tried
to
kick
an
officer.
