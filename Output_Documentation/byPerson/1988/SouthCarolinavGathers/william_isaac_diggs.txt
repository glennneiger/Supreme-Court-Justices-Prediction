mr.
william
isaac
diggs
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
draw
the
court's
attention
to
page
66...
or
excuse
me...
page
17
of
the
joint
appendix
concerning
the
testimony
and
the
lighting.
justice
o'connor,
you
asked
was
it
likely
that
mr.
gathers
read
this
game
guy's
prayer
and
the
voter
registration
card
prior
to
his
committing
these
acts.
the
question
was:
"what
was
the
lighting
like.
"
"was
it
dark?
"
the
answer
is:
"it
was
dark
out
there".
so,
it's
very
unlikely,
i
submit,
that
this
individual
stood
there
and
read
this
card
and
began
to
formulate
an
intent
to
kill
as
a
result
of
his
knowledge
that
this
man
was
a
christian
and
that
he
was
a
registered
voter.
also,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
in
its
presentation,
the
state
has
conceded
that
the
voter
registration
card
in
this
case
was
not
relevant
to
a
sentencing
determination
because
it
wasn't
relevant
to
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
or
the
characteristics
of
the
defendant.
and
as
we'll
reach
a
little
bit
further
in
the
argument,
we
would
submit
that
the
use
of
a
voter
registration
card
to
invoke
a
death
sentence
from
a
sentence...
a
death
sentence
from
a
sentencing
authority
is
a
constitutionally
impermissible
basis
for
imposing
a
sentence
of
death.
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
absolutely
not
unless
they're
asked
to
do
that
in
a
closing
argument
by
the
solicitor,
and
that's
what
i'm
submitting
is
a
fair
reading--
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
--i
think
that
a
solicitor,
a
skillful
and
experienced
solicitor,
could
take
a
piece
of
evidence
like
that
and
in
the
nature
of
the
argument
that
was
advanced
in
this
case,
that
he
is
a...
he
is
one
of
us,
his
life,
because
of
that,
is
more
valuable
and--
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
--therefore
based
on
that
a
death...
a
death
sentence
would
be
appropriate.
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
justice
rehnquist,
the
solicitor
argued
that
these
factors...
and
if
you
look
at
this
argument
in
context,
the
game
guy's
prayer
card...
the
fact
that
this
man
was
a
christian
and
the
fact
that
he
was
a
registered
voter
who
believed
in
his
community
and
participated
in
the
process,
cry
out
from
the
grave
in
support
of
a
sentence
of
death.
that's
the
way
it
was
couched,
and
that's
the
way
that
evidence
was
used
in
this
case.
and
what
we're
saying
is
unless
the
state
can
demonstrably
show
in
some
constitutionally
permissible
way
that
those
factors
were
relevant
to
the
commission
of
this
crime
and
in
some
way
reflect
on
the
characteristic
of
the
defendant
that
it
is
a...
they
are
constitutionally
impermissible
bases--
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
--well,
would
cite
the
court
to
the
language
in
booth
v.
maryland
itself
where
this
court
cites
zant
v.
stephens.
and
i
would
rely
on
zant
v.
stephens
for
the
proposition
that
constitutionally
protected
rights
and
choices,
such
as
religion
and
politics,
cannot
have
attached
to
them
aggravating
labels
by
a
state
in
a
capital
sentencing
scheme.
now,
given
that
proposition,
the...
the
exact
reverse
would
be
true
with
regard
to
the
victim
in
the
case.
and...
and
i'll
explain
to
you
why,
because
in
the
united
states,
you
and
i
all...
we
all
have
the
right
to
the...
the
right
to
free
speech,
the
right
to
assemble
with
other
people,
and
the
right
to
choose
or
reject
a
religion.
and
it
would
not
be
permissible,
i
would
submit
to
you,
to
have
an
individual
feel
or
be
told
that
his
life
somehow
has
less
value
to
it
because
he
has
or
she
has
rejected
a
particular
religion
that
the
solicitor
perhaps
has
accepted.
if
i
go
into
an
unsafe
area
of
a
community,
i
want
to
feel
like
i
am
receiving
the
full
protection
of
the
law
as
well
as
other
people
who
may
be
members
of
other
religions
separate
and
apart
from
the...
the
one
that
i
happen
to
profess
or
reject.
and
so,
i
would
submit
that
religion
and
politics,
constitutionally
protected
freedom
of
choice
type
protections
that
we
have,
could
never
be
used
as
a
basis
in
and
of
themselves
for
the
imposition
of
a
death
sentence.
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
that's
correct.
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
that's
correct.
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
that's
right.
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
think
that
it
would
be
fair
to
characterize
this
as
merely
a
reference.
the
solicitor,
if
you
look
at
the
joint
appendix,
took
up
an
entire
page
reading
that
game
guy's
prayer
and...
and
the
entire
three-quarters
of
a
page--
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
--it
had
been
in
evidence,
and
he
reread
the
card,
the
game
guy's
prayer,
in
the
context
of
using
that
card
and
mr.
haynes'
belief
in
it
in
and
of
itself
as
a
basis
for
imposing
a
death
sentence
in
the
case.
now,
the
evidence
could
be
admitted.
there
is
certainly
evidence
in
record
that
not
only
mr.
gathers
but
other
people
rummaged
through
this
victim's
personal
belongings.
and
it's...
it's
conceded
that
the
game
guy's
prayer
and
the
voter
registration
card
was
there.
those
items
were
properly
admitted
into
evidence
or
were
not
objected
to
simply
because
they
were
evidence
that
the
individual
assailants
in
this
case
rummaged
through
looking
for
things
of
value
to
steal.
i
don't--
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
--that...
that
was
on
the
question
of
guilt.
it
wasn't--
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
--well,
it
was
a
wholesale
admission
of
all
of
the
evidence
that
was
admitted
at
the
guilt
phase.
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
that's
correct.
but
i
would
submit
that
simply
because
evidence
like
that
is
admitted
to
show
you
that
perhaps
there
was
an
attempted
robbery
here
that
the
subject
matter
of
that
evidence
can
then
be
spring-boarded
or
bootstrapped
up
to
a
reason
for
imposing
a
death
sentence
as
was
done
in
the
closing
argument
here.
the
evidence
was
properly
admitted
to
show
what
happened
at
the...
at
the
criminal
assault
stage
of
this
case.
but
i
would
submit
that
the
subject
matter
of
that
material
cannot
in
and
of
itself
be
used
as
a
basis
for
imposing
a
death
sentence
because
it
is
a
religious
consideration
and
a
political
consideration
which
are
constitutionally
protected
rights.
i
think
where
the
state's
case
in
this
particular--
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
--of
course,
it
can
consider
it
if
those
handicaps
reflect
on
he
characteristic
of
the
defendant.
of
course.
if
it...
if
it
can
be
demonstrated
that
the
blindness
didn't
contribute
to
the...
to
the
offense...
for
example,
suppose
you
go
out
and
you
got
a
blind
child
out
playing
basketball.
some
kids
come
up
and
they
realize
that
he
can't
really
see
that
well,
and
they
see
his
bicycle
parked
over.
and
so,
he
can
see
well
enough
that
he
can
avoid
running
into
objects,
but
he
can't
really
identify
people.
the
individuals
kind
of
sidekick
the
ball
down
the
hill.
and
while
the
child
goes
to
pick
it
up,
they
ride
off
on
his
bicycle.
now,
the
blindness
of
the
child,
lot
of
course,
can
be
introduced
into...
at
that
point.
it
becomes
relevant
to
the
moral
culpability
of
the
defendants.
but
if
that
same
child
were
walking
down
the
street
and
suddenly
hit
as
a
car
passed
by
as
a
result
of
a
random
shooter
in
that
car,
the
shooter...
the...
the
actor
shooting
that
gun,
having
no
knowledge
or
indication
that
that
child
is
blind,
shoots
him
and
kills
him,
then
the
blindness
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
or
the
characteristics
of
the
defendant.
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
the...
the
culpability--
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
--the
culpability
certainly
takes
into
account
a
child
versus
an
adult,
and
certainly
that
would
be
considered.
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
i
believe
that
it
is
something
that
reflects
on
the
characteristic
of
the
defendant.
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
that's
right.
that's
correct.
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
that...
okay,
i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood
that.
a
random
shooting,
that's
correct.
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
culpability
would
be
the
same.
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
i'm
not
sure
that
i
follow
that...
that
question.
could
you--
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
--uh-hum.
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
well--
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
--i
think
that
the...
you
know,
that's
why
we
have
juries.
that's
why
we
have
sentencing
authorities
to
take
into
account
every
consideration
that's
relevant
to
the
circumstances
of
that
crime.
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
well,
i
don't...
unless
it's
obvious
that...
that
the
jury
is
going
to
do
that
and...
and
you
can
cure
that
by
some
kind
of
limiting
instruction,
i
don't
see
now
you
could
go
into
the
jury
room
and
prevent
deliberations
on
certain
aspects
of
the
case.
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
well,
the...
i
think
what
you're
going
to
have
to
do
is
allow
each
side
to
present
the
evidence
that's
presentable
under
the
rules
of
evidence
in
the
case,
let
that
case
go
to
the
jury
with
proper
instructions
that
are
applicable
to
the
evidence
that
has
been
introduced,
and
then
allow
the
jury
to...
to
consider
the
circumstances
of
this
crime
and
the
characteristics
of
the
defendant
and
make
a
decision
as
to
what
the
sentence
should
be.
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
characteristics
of--
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
--do
you
mean
the
characteristics
of
the
victim
or
the
defendant?
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
well,
at--
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
--i
don't
think
that
we're
talking
about
at
the
guilt
phase
of
a
proceeding
where
the
question
at
issue
is
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
accused.
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
i
don't
think...
when
i
mentioned
limiting
instructions,
of
course,
i'm
not
talking
about
that
situation.
i
think
that
to
be...
a
jury
has
to
be
permitted
to
consider
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
and
the
characteristics
of
a
defendant,
and--
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
--i
don't
think
that
if
it
has...
i
think
it
if
has
nothing
to
do...
i
would
submit
if
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
and
the
characteristics
of
the...
of
the
defendant,
then
it
has
no
relevancy
to
the
moral
culpability
of
the
defendant.
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
if...
if
the
evidence
showed
that
it
did
not
in
some
way
cast
light
on
the
moral
culpability
of
the
accused,
then
that's
correct.
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
if--
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
--if
the
victim
is
aware...
i
mean,
if
the
victim's
characteristics
are
known
to
the
accused
and
some
way
can
be
shown
to
be
an
impetus
for
the
murderous
act,
then
it
certainly
would
be
proper--
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
--if
you
could...
if
you
could
fairly
infer
from
that
record
that
the
defendant
read
that
card
and
said
i
don't
like
christians
and
i
don't
like
voters--
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
--well--
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
--i
would...
i
would
answer
that
by
saying
if
the
prosecution
can't
demonstrate
that
that
knowledge
was
in
some
way
responsible
for
the
accused's
actions--
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
--justice
o'connor,
i
don't
think
that
his
moral
culpability
would
be
enhanced
because
he
selected
a
christian
as
opposed
to
some
other
individual
to
murder.
i
would
submit
that's--
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
--i
would
submit
that
it
would
not
be
permitted
to
be
so
under
the
constitution,
under
the
language
that
this
court
wrote
in
the
zant
v.
stephens
case.
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
that
he
knows
the
circumstances
that
this...
that--
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
--absolutely
it
does
go
to
it.
absolutely.
that
certainly
is
circumstance
of
the
crime.
it's
something
that
the
defendant
knew
about
when
he
undertook
to
engage
in
this
murderous
act
anyway.
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
well,
he
knew
that
the
victim
in
this
case
had
personal
effects
that
were
rummaged
through.
we
knew
that...
or
mr.
gathers
knew
the
victim
had
these
items
in
his
possession.
he
rummaged
through
them
looking
for
something
to
steal,
probably
money.
and
i
would
submit
that
none
of
the
items
that
mr.
haynes
had
in
his
possession
at
the
time
reflect
really
on
the
moral
culpability
of
this
defendant
because
it
can't
be
shown
that
they
were
an
impetus
for
the
murder
in
this
case.
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
well,
i
think
it
goes...
in
that
situation,
it
clearly
goes
to
moral
culpability
because
he's
aware
of
the
fact.
he's
aware
of
obvious
ramifications
of
this
act
of
murder.
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
that's
right.
absolutely
because
it
would
have
been
obvious
to
the
defendant.
obviously
if
you
kill
a
parent
that's
going
to
leave
a...
an
orphan
child,
it
goes
to
the
question
of
culpability.
but
that...
you
know,
that's
not
what
we
have
in
this
case.
we
have
a
situation
where
the
victim
happened
to
be
in
possession
of
certain
items
and
they
happen
to
relate
to
religion
and
to
politics,
a
voter
registration
card.
it...
there
is
an
argument
in
the
record
that
shows
that
the
solicitor
utilized
those
items
as
a
basis
is
for
imposing
a
sentence
of
death
in
the
case,
and
i
would
submit
that's
constitutionally
impermissible.
that's
the
position
of
the
respondent.
now,
the
state
of
south
carolina
can't
realize...
and
i
think
this
goes
to
a
lot
of
the
questions
that
we've...
that
i
have
received
in
the
last
few
minutes.
the
state
of
south
carolina
has
a
common
law
definition
of
murder,
and
it
was
in
effect
long
before
even
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
was
adopted
here.
so,
before
we
ever
even
had
an
eighth
amendment
or
a
fourteenth
amendment,
south
carolina
had
that...
had
adopted
that
common
law
definition
of
murder.
and
through
this
day
even,
it
remains
unchanged,
and
it's
the
law
of
the
state
now.
it
was
the
law
of
the
state
at
the
time
mr.
haynes
was
killed.
and
that
definition
of
murder
codified
by
the
general
assembly,
by
the
legislature
in
south
carolina,
at
title
16
of
our
code
defines
murder
as
the
unlawful
killing
of
another
human
being
with
malice
aforethought.
now,
if
you
look...
if
you
research
the
crime
of
murder
in
south
carolina,
you
find
a
lot
of
cases
that
deal
with
that
element
of
malice
aforethought,
but
you
don't
find
in
that
same
research
any
cases
that
deal
with
the
element
of
human
being.
and
i
think
this
is
where
the
state's
case
here
falls
down.
proverbially
they
can't
see
the
forest
for
the
trees
in
this
case
because
under
south
carolina
law
now,
as
it
always
has,
values
a
human
life
the
same,
any
human
life--
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
--well,
basically
the
law
in
south
carolina
is
that
a
victim's
characteristics
are
irrelevant
to
a
sentencing
consideration
because
all
individuals
have
that
same
right
of
protection
in
south
carolina
not
to
be
murdered
unlawfully
or
not
to
be
killed
unlawfully.
and
therefore,
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina,
as
has
the
legislature
in...
in
the
state
as
well,
declared
that
personal
characteristics
of
a
victim
simply
aren't
relevant
in
a
sentencing
proceeding
unless
they
can
be
shown
to
be
related--
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
--well,
i...
i
assume
that
it
was.
i'm
not...
i
can't
give
you
a
definitive
answer.
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
that's
correct.
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
but
the
position
that
the
respondent
takes
in
the
case
is
that
because
human
life
is
valued
equally
in
south
carolina
under
this
statute,
and
because
the
status
of
the
law
at
the
time
of
this
case,
as
reflected
in
the
adoption
of
the
statute
back
in
1977,
if
you
look
at
the
aggravating
circumstances
that
the
general
assembly
has
adopted
which
permits...
the
presence
of
which
permits
the
state
to
seek
a
death
penalty,
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
victims'
characteristics
because
victims
aren't
valued
equally.
we
have
other
aggravating
circumstances
such
as
robbery,
kidnapping,
events
of
that
sort
that
warrant
the
state
seeking
the
death
penalty.
in
fact,
under
south
carolina
law
i
would
submit
that
the
state
with
the
presence
of
aggravating
circumstances
is
faced
with
a
situation
where
the
death
penalty
is
warranted...
is
warranted
but
for
the
presence
of
certain
mitigating
circumstances
which
the
sentencer
in
the
case
decides
warrants
the
dispensing
of
mercy
to
the
accused.
and
for
that
reason,
the
status
of
the
law...
the
supreme
court
in
gaskins,
state
v.
gaskins,
held
that
victim's
personal
characteristics...
the
fact
that
rudolph
tyner,
who
himself
was
a
death
row
inmate
in
south
carolina,
was
killed
while
he
resided
on
death
row
by
mr.
gaskins
and
the
fact
that
he
had
confessed
to
prior
murders
was
irrelevant
when
the
decision
came
to
be
made
about
whether
mr.
gaskins
was
to
live
or
to
die.
and
the
sentence
imposed
in
gaskins,
of
course,
was...
was
the
death
penalty.
now,
in
its
reply
brief,
the
state
argues
that
gaskins
is
really
unclear.
we
don't
really
know
what
the
law
is
in
south
carolina
because
that
opinion
is
not
clearly...
doesn't
clearly
state
the
status
of
the
law.
but
i
would
submit
you
ultimately
have
to
look
at
the
language
in
the
gathers'
opinion
where
it
cites
gaskins
for
the
proposition
that
evidence
of
a
victim's
bad
character
is
inadmissible
in
a
sentencing
phase
trial.
i'd
move
on
to
the
second
point
that
the
respondent
would
like
to
make,
and
that
is
given
the
status
of
the
law
in
south
carolina,
there
was
really
no
mechanism
there
in
place
for
us
to
challenge
or
rebut
the
evidence
that
the
solicitor
or
the
points
the
solicitor
urged
in
his
argument
to
test
the
accuracy
and
the
reliability
of
them.
now,
skipper
v.
south
carolina
is
a
case
that
attorneys
in
south
carolina
think
is
a
very
important
case.
and,
of
course,
the
concurring
opinion
in
skipper
talks
about
the
need
to
be
able
to
confront
and
test
the
reliability
and
the
accuracy
of
information
that's
being
used
as
a
basis
for
a
death
sentence.
and
in
south
carolina...
of
course,
that
case
relies
on
gardner
v.
florida.
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
well,
i
think
under
my--
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
--under
my
argument,
that's
correct.
mr.
william
isaac
diggs
but
if
the
law
is
that
the
evidence
is
admissible
anyway
regardless
of
whether
it
reflects
on
circumstances
of
the
crime
or
characteristics
of
the
defendant,
then
you
would
obviously
have
a
right
and
a
duty
to
go
out
and
solicit
or
dig
up
the
information
that
shows
the
contrary
and
introduce
it
at...
at
the
sentencing
phase
in
mitigation.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
i
believe
that
would
be
all
that
i
have
this
morning.
thank
you.
