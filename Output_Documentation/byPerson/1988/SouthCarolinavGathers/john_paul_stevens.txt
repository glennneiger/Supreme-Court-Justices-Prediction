justice

mr.
zelenka,
was
there
any
evidence
that
the
defendant
read
the
prayer
card?
justice
stevens
he
was
looking
at
all
this
stuff
when
he
was
looking
for
valuable
material.
justice
stevens
what
time
of
day
did
this
occur?
justice
stevens
was
it
a
lighted
area?
was
it
something
you
could
read
small
print
on
a
prayer
card
quite
readily
in
the
dark?
justice
stevens
so,
you
really
don't
know
whether
he
read--
justice
stevens
--the
card
or
not.
justice
stevens
well,
they
reviewed
them
while
they
were
looking
for
money
and
jewelry
and
that
sort
of
stuff.
justice
stevens
but
you...
and
you...
you
would
infer
from
that
that
they
stopped
and
picked
up
the
prayer
card
and
read
it.
it's
rather
lengthy
too,
as
i
remember
it...
read
the
whole
thing.
justice
stevens
would
the
defendant
have
been
able
to
put
in
evidence
in
south
carolina
to
show
that
the
victim
really
was
not
at
all
the
kind
of
man
that's
described
in
the
prayer
card,
but
really
was...
was
a
fraud
and...
and
did
not
practice
his
religion
at
all?
justice
stevens
what
is
your
view
of
the
south
carolina
law?
would
that
be
permissible--
justice
stevens
--right.
justice
stevens
well,
the
defendant--
justice
stevens
--can
the
defendant
put
in
as
a
mitigating
factor
the
fact
that
the
man
he
killed
was
a
particularly
bad
person?
justice
stevens
well,
no.
say
it
isn't...
it
is
unrelated
just
as...
as
hers
i
guess
it's
not
particularly
related.
can
he
just
put
in
the
fact
the
man...
the
man
he
killed
was...
you
know,
had
been
convicted
of
crimes
and
one
thing
and
another,
and
therefore
the
killing
doesn't
seem
all
that
bad?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
mr.
diggs,
has
that
always
been
the
law
of
south
carolina.
i
notice
this
was
a
32
year
old
black
male.
and
was
the
death
penalty
imposed
in
cases
where
the
defendant
and
the
victim
were
both
black
with
frequency
in
south
carolina
throughout
its
history?
justice
stevens
perhaps
the
prosecutor
had
a
special
burden
here
if
it
wasn't
so
because
he
had
a
black
on
both...
i
take
it
the
defendant
was
black,
was
he
not
also?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
--but,
mr,
zelenka,
apart
from
the
care
that
was
in
his
possession,
what
evidence
was
there
that
he
was
a
good
christian?
justice
stevens
i
mean,
how
do
we
know
that
he
subscribed
to
the...
to
the
tenets
of
the
card
in
his
possession?
i
mean,
maybe--
--well,
he
had
a
bible,
didn't
he?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
there's
a
great
deal
more
on
the
card
than
just
reference
to
a
bible
or
a
sheet.
justice
stevens
and
it
took...
how
long
did
it
take
to
read
that
card
to
the
jury?
it
took
several...
it
must
have
taken
several
minutes,
it's
a
long--
justice
stevens
--well,
i
understand
it's
in
evidence.
i'm
not--
justice
stevens
--this
is
clearly...
this
is
the
kind
of
character
he
was
because
he
carried
this
card.
justice
stevens
--is
there
any--
justice
stevens
looking
for
something
to
steal
is
the
testimony
you
called
our
attention
to.
