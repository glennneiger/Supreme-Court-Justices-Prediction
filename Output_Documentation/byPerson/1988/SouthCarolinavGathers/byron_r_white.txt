justice
white
well,
i
take
it
you...
you
think
booth
shouldn't
apply
to
any
characterization
of
the
victim.
justice
white
that...
just...
just
the
family.
justice
white
you
think...
you
think
booth
on
its
face
was
so
limited?
justice
white
well,
do
you
think
that...
do
you
think
then
that
the...
the
prosecution
should
be
able
to
introduce
evidence
about
the
character
of
the
victim
wholly
aside
from
any...
any
circumstances
of
the
crime?
justice
white
but
you
think...
going
that
far
is
inconsistent
with
booth
you
think.
justice
white
but
is
there
any...
is
there
any...
is
it
clear
from
the
record
one
way
or
another
that
you
can
see
to
read
the
card
at
that
time?
justice
white
well,
you
have--
justice
white
--you
have
some
testimony
that
it
was
dark.
justice
white
well,
that
may
be
so,
but
that...
that's
a
long
ways
from
saying
you
could
read
a
card.
justice
white
or
would...
or
would
recognize
a
voter's
registration
card.
justice
white
i
suppose
you
could
recognize
money.
justice
white
and
the...
and
the
defendant
said...
at
least
said
that
he
knew
that
there...
that
he
had
bible.
he
could
see
that
well.
