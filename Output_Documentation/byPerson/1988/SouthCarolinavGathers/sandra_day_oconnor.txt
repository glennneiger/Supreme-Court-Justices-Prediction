justice
o'connor
did
the
evidence
show
that
the
defendant
had
an
opportunity
to
examine
the
prayer
card
at
the
time
he
was
committing
these
offenses?
justice
o'connor
the
prayer
card.
justice
o'connor
was
received
in
evidence.
justice
o'connor
after
he
had
looked
at
all
these
items.
justice
o'connor
in
this
case,
i
take
it
the
two
cards
you
complain
about
were
received
in
evidence
at
the
guilt
it
phase
without
objection.
justice
o'connor
and
the
jury
properly
looked
at
them.
justice
o'connor
the
same
jury
served
as
the
sentencing
jury.
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
do
you
suppose
that
it
could
be
said
that
in
view
of
the
evidence
of
the
extreme
brutality
of
this
crime
and
the
circumstances
of
it,
that
any
reference
by
the
prosecutor
to
these
items
was
harmless?
justice
o'connor
well,
the
jury
had
read
it
already,
for
goodness
sakes.
it
isn't
as
though
they
didn't
know
what
was
in
it.
it
had
been
in
evidence.
they
knew
what
was
there.
justice
o'connor
what
if
in
this
case
the
evidence
showed
that
it
was
broad
daylight
and
the
defendant
read
every
word
of
the
voter
registration
card
and
the
prayer,
and
then
went
on
and
did
what
he
did?
justice
o'connor
no,
no.
he
just
read
it.
he
knew
fully
what
he
had
here
in
the
way
of
a
potential
victim,
a
poor,
old
fellow
who
maybe
had
some
rather
oddball
religious
characteristics
sitting
on
the
park
bench
trying
to
change
his
clothes.
justice
o'connor
and
he
reads
all
that
and
then
does
the
terrible
things
that
he
did
to
this
victim.
justice
o'connor
you
don't
think
that
the
knowledge
goes
to
the
moral
culpability
of
the
defendant
who
knows
what
he
has
here
in
the
way
of
a
victim
and
then
cold-bloodedly
does
the
things
that
this
person
did
to
this
old
man?
justice
o'connor
we
don't
know
the
nature
of
the
religious
belief,
just
some
poor,
old
soul
who
had
these
characteristics.
you
don't
think
that
relates
to
the
moral
culpability
of
this
defendant?
justice
o'connor
what
if
the
defendant
goes
in
and
rapes
and
murders
a
mother
with
sleeping
children
nearby?
you
don't
think
it
goes
to
his
moral
culpability
that
he
knows
the
circumstances?
justice
o'connor
victim
is
a
mother
and
is
going
to
leave
orphan
children
when
he's
finished.
you
don't
think
that
goes
to
his
moral--
justice
o'connor
--and
precisely
so
here
with
this
poor,
old
fellow
on
the
park
bench.
