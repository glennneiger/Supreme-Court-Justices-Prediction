justice
scalia
if
so,
why
can't
you
put
in
evidence
to
that
effect?
justice
scalia
yes,
but
assuming...
assuming
booth
is
right,
if
you
can't
get
in
evidence,
why
can
you
make
comments?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
i
can
understand...
i
can
understand
half
your
argument
if
you
just
say
that
booth
is
wrong,
but...
but
you're
also
trying
to
make
the
argument
that
even
if
booth
is
right,
you
should
win
in
this
case.
right?
justice
scalia
well,
do
you
know
any
other
area
where
we
say
the...
no
evidence
of
that
is
admissible,
and
it,
indeed,
is
unconstitutional
to
admit
evidence
of
that
during
the
trial.
however,
the
prosecutor
may
comment
upon
that
during...
during
his
summation.
do
you
know
of
any
other
area
where...
where
we
make
that
kind
of
a
distinction?
justice
scalia
well,
that's
fine,
and
he
could
make
the
argument
if
it
had
to
do
with
the
circumstance.
but
he
wasn't
making
that
argument.
he
was
calling
attention
to
the
characteristics
of
the
victim
in
an
effort
to
get
the
jury
to
impose
a
higher
penalty.
justice
scalia
and
if
we've
said
that
you
can't
take
into
account
the
characteristics
of
the
victim,
then...
then
that's
just
wrong,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
don't
you
think
that's
a
rather
flukish
rule
of
law
that...
that
whether
i
get
the
death
penalty
because...
because
the
jury
is...
is
allowed
to
consider
an
argument
by
the
prosecution
that
the...
my
victim
is
a
particularly
virtuous...
particularly
virtuous...
person,
that
all
depends
on
what
happens
to
be
in
the
fellow's
wallet
when
i
go
through
it?
justice
scalia
it's
absolutely
flukish.
is...
is
that
really
the
kind
of
rule
you're
asking
us
to--
justice
scalia
--if
it
happens
to
get
into
the...
into
the...
into
the
guilt
phase
of...
of
the
trial
just...
just
accidentally,
then...
then
it's
free
game
in
the...
in
the
argument
to
the...
to
the
jury
on...
on
penalty.
justice
scalia
well,
it
doesn't
let
us
do
that
in
other...
in
other
situations.
justice
scalia
only
if
you
know,
only
if
you
know
i
understood--
justice
scalia
--justice
kennedy's
question
to
be
a
random
shot.
justice
scalia
random
shooting--
justice
scalia
why
would
you
request
an
instruction
from
the
judge?
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
necessarily
during
the...
during
the
guilt
phase
there's
been
some
evidence
admitted
that
shows
some
of
the
characteristics
of
the
defendant.
it
shows
he
was
an
eight
year
old
and
blind.
justice
scalia
i
enjoin
you
not
to
consider
those
characteristics
because
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the...
for
purposes
of
the
guilt
phase,
for
purpose
of
the
penalty,
i
enjoin
you
to
not
consider
any
of
those
characteristics.
justice
scalia
of...
of
the
victim.
of
the
victim.
justice
scalia
you
should
get
an
instruction
like
that,
shouldn't
you?
justice
scalia
i'm
sorry.
at...
at
the
penalty
phase
you
should
get
an
instruction,
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
you've
learned
during
the
trial
incidentally
that
this
was
an
eight
year
old,
blind
boy
who
happened
to
be
killed,
but
you
should
not
take
that
into
account
for
purposes
of
determining
now
severely
this
person
should
be
punished
since
he
didn't
know
that
it
was
an
eight
year
old,
blind
boy.
justice
scalia
well,
why?
you
say
we
can't
tell
them
to...
we
can't
ask
them
to
consider
it,
but
you...
you
want
to
let
them
violate
the
law.
justice
scalia
so,
the
jury
should
not
consider
it
and
it
would
be
okay
to...
and
probably
desirable
to
instruct
the
jury
not
to
consider
it.
justice
scalia
well,
i
assume
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
get
in...
if
the
theory
on
which
this
were
admitted
were...
were
not
just
that
these
were
characteristics
of
the
victim,
which
the
jury
can
take
into
account,
but
rather
they
were
characteristics
of
the
victim
that
the
defendant
knew
of
and
therefore
the
jury
can
take
it
into
account,
i
suppose
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
introduce
any
rebuttal
evidence
unless
you
could
also
show
that
the
defendant
knew
of
that.
for
instance,
if
you
had
rebuttal
evidence
that
showed
that
this
fellow
really
wasn't
a
good
christian...
he
just
pretended
to
be
a
christian...
that
wouldn't
make
any
difference
so
long
as
the
defendant
didn't
know
that
he
was
a
phony
christian--
justice
scalia
--it
gets
curiouser
and
curiouser.
justice
scalia
yes.
justice
scalia
mr.
zelenka,
this--
justice
scalia
--this
goes
to
a...
a
very
basic
point.
i
haven't...
i
had
not
understood
your
briefs
to
be
making
the
argument
that
the
reason
this
can
be
introduced,
the
fact
that
he
was
a
good
christian,
is
only
because
the
defendant
knew
he
was
a
good
christian.
is
that
your
point--
justice
scalia
--that
you...
it
isn't.
justice
scalia
it's
you
can
show
he's
a
good
christian
whether
the
defendant
knew
he
was
a
good
christian
or
not.
isn't
that
it?
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
and
is...
is...
is--
justice
scalia
--but
that...
is
that
essential
for
the...
for
the
admissibility
in...
in...
in
your
view,
that
the
reason
it's
admissible
is
because
the
defendant
knew
he
was
a
good
christian
when
he
killed
him?
justice
scalia
or
only
because
the
person
he
killed
happened
to
be
a
good
christian?
justice
scalia
there
wasn't.
justice
scalia
do
we
know
that
they
knew
that
he
was
a
voter?
justice
scalia
that
he
had
a
voter
registration
card
among
all
that
junk.
justice
scalia
we
don't
know
that
they
read
it
or
that
they
even
knew
what
it
was.
justice
scalia
so...
so,
at
least
as
to
that
argument
of
the
prosecutor,
you
have
to
defend
the
position
that
it
didn't
matter
whether
they
knew
he
was
a
voter
and
a
good
citizen
or
not.
he
was
a
good
citizen,
and
they
should
be
able
to
get
that
in
so
long
as
there's
evidence
that
has
been
admitted
at
the...
at
the
guilt
phase
that
shows
it.
justice
scalia
well,
but,
mr.--
