justice
kennedy
well,
how
was
the
contents
of
the
prayer
card
relevant
to
the
circumstances
of
the
crime?
gathers
didn't
read
the
prayer
card.
justice
kennedy
you
read
the
whole
prayer
card
to
the
jury.
justice
kennedy
how...
how
is
that
relevant
to
the
circumstances
of
the
crime?
justice
kennedy
well,
how
were
the
contents
of
the
card
relevant?
justice
kennedy
well,
that's
your
conclusion.
i
don't
see
how
it
related
to
the
characteristics
of
the
crime.
justice
kennedy
was
that
after
the
prosecution's
summation?
justice
kennedy
to
what
issue...
to
what
disputed
issue
in
the
case
was
the
voter
registration
card
relevant?
justice
kennedy
so,
in
any...
your
position
is
that
anytime
there's
a
robbery
and
a
murder
and
the
victim's
wallet
is
involved,
you
can
go
through
the
wallet
and...
and
use
that
as
circumstances
of
the
crime
in
order
to
get
around
the
booth
holding?
justice
kennedy
--of
course,
i
take
it
your
position
would
be
the
same
under
booth
if
the
victim
was...
was
blind
or
helpless
or
an
infant.
the
jury
doesn't
have...
can't
consider
any
of
that.
justice
kennedy
so,
if
you
shoot
a
gun...
so,
if
you
shoot
a
gun
and
you
hit
school
children
and
you
shoot
a
gun
and
you
hit
dope
dealers,
is
the
penalty
the
same?
justice
kennedy
constitutionally.
justice
kennedy
it
does
under
booth
in
your
view.
why
should
it
do
that
in
your
view?
justice
kennedy
--and
i
take
it
your
position
would
be
the
same
if
the
jury
simply
mentioned
this
on
its
own.
somebody
on
the
jury
said
this
is
a
decent
man
in
the
community
or
this
was
an
innocent
child.
so
long
as
the
shooting
is
random,
that's
irrelevant
and
reversible
error
under
the
constitution.
justice
kennedy
suppose
the
jury
on
its
own
considers
factors
that
the
booth
case
tells
us
the
prosecution
cannot
mention,
i.e.,
the
victim
was
a
decent
person
in
the
community--
justice
kennedy
--or
a
blind
person
or
an
infant
or
a
president...
all
of
those
things--
justice
kennedy
--would
be
grounds
for
reversal
i
take
it
if
the
jury
considered
them
on
their
own
as
opposed
to
the
prosecution
mentioning
them?
justice
kennedy
so
now...
so
now
we
have
the
position
that
the
jury
can
consider
things
that
the
prosecution
can't
mention?
justice
kennedy
well,
i'm
talking
about
what
the
constitutional
duty
of
a
jury
is.
suppose
you
have
a
well-instructed
jury.
the
jurors
read
booth.
justice
kennedy
xxx.
well,
of
course,
you
assume
that
moral
culpability
of
the
accused
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
identity
of
the
victim.
justice
kennedy
that's
your
definition
of
moral
culpability.
