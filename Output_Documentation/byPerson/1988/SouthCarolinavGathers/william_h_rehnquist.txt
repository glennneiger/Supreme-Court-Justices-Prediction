chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
88-305,
south
carolina
v.
demetrius
gathers.
mr.
zelenka,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
the...
did
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
say
that
it
was
error
to
consider
this
evidence
or
simply
error
for
the
prosecutor
to
comment
on
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
but
it
didn't
suggest
that
the
evidence
couldn't
be
considered.
chief
justice
rehnquist
this
evidence
was
admitted
at
the
guilt
phase.
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
zelenka.
mr.
diggs?
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
a
jury
is
very
likely
to
find
a
voter
registration
card
critical
in
deciding
whether
to
impose
life
or
death?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
do...
do
you
think
the
jury
is
likely
to
accede
to
the
solicitor's
suggestion
that
although
in...
if
there...
if
it
weren't
for
this
voter
registration
card,
he
shouldn't
get
the
death
penalty?
since
the
voter
registration
card
is
before
you,
he
should.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--well,
i
can
see
the
solicitor
relying
on
a
number
of
factors,
but
the
idea
that
it
all
turns
on
the
voter
registration
card,
which
i
thought
perhaps
was
your
position,
makes
little
sense
to
me.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what's
your
authority
for
that
proposition?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
they
were
also
admitted
at
the
guilt
phase,
weren't
they?
chief
justice
rehnquist
weren't
they
also
admitted
at
the
penalty
phase?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
they
were
admitted
at
the
penalty--
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you
can't
show
that
the...
the
mother
with
her
young
children...
you
probably
can't
show
that
the
young
children
were
an
impetus
for
the
murder.
it
might
be
quite
the
contrary.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
if
this...
if
this
fellow
on
the
park
bench
had
had
a
small
son
with
him,
that
could
have
come
in,
but
the
rest
couldn't.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
then
you
would
think
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
in
this
case
would
have
relied
on
the
principle
you're
talking
about
rather
than
relying
on
our
federal
constitutional
decision
in
booth.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
diggs.
mr.
zelenka,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
zelenka.
the
case
is
submitted.
