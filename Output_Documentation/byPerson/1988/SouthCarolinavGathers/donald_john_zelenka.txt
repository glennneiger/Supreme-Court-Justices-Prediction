mr.
donald
john
zelenka
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
an
opportunity
for
the
court
to
revisit
the
role
of
the
victim
in
capital
sentencing
proceedings
and
prevent
further
eroding
of
that
role
in
the
criminal
justice
equation
of
punishment.
particularly
this
case
presents
the
narrow
issue
of
whether
the
prosecutor's
argument
during
the
sentencing
phase
violates
the
eighth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
when
it
focuses
on
the
characteristics
of
the
victim,
as
well
as
the
defendant,
rather
than
only
the
defendant
when
the
characteristics
are
directly
drawn
from
the
evidence
admitted
at
the
trial
and
obvious
to
the
jury.
in
september
1986,
richard
haynes,
a
32
year
old
black
male,
was
brutally
beaten,
his
possessions
ransacked.
he
was
sexually
assaulted
and
murdered
by
demetrius
gathers
and
his
accomplices.
the
beatings
occurred
at
a
city
park
when
hayres
had
gone
to
review
religious
materials
that
he
had
set
out
on
the
park
bench
when
he
was
accosted
for
the
first
time
in
reckless
disregard
of
his
rights
to
free
expression
in
practicing
his
religion.
in
the
sentencing
phase,
the
prosecutor
commented
upon
evidence
that
was
admitted
to
the
trial
obvious
to
the
jury
from
the
guilt
phase
the
victim
was
a
religious
person,
that
he
was
a
registered
voter,
and
he
read
from
a
prayer
card
in
evidence
referred
to
as
the
game
guy's
prayer
about
a
person
wanting
a
fair
chance
in
life
and
giving
others
that
same
fair
chance.
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina,
relying
on
this
court's
decision
in
booth,
asserted
that
these
comments
on
the
personal
characteristics
of
the
defendant
were
not
necessary
for
an
understanding
of
the
crime,
and
therefore
violated
the
eighth
amendment.
we
submit
that
the
eighth
amendment
was
not
violated
by
these
prosecutor's
comments
and
that
the
eighth
amendment
allows
a
jury
in
any
capital
punishment
situation
to
have
an
understanding
as
to
who
the
victim
was
and
what
he
was
doing
at
the
time
he
was
brutally
murdered.
the
eighth
amendment,
we
submit,
does
not
preclude
comments
that
are
directly
related.
yes,
sir?
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
we
submit
that
to
that
extent
booth
is
wrong,
that
evidence--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--you
certainly
should
be
able--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--that's
correct.
the
evidence--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--i
don't
think
in
any
area
such
as
this
the...
excuse
me...
the
elements
of
what
that
particular
victim
were
related
directly
here
to
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
that
were
admissible
for
that
purpose
as
the
res
justified--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--he
was
referring--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--well,
the
characteristics
of
the
victim
that...
that
booth
was
concerned
with
were
characteristics
that
were
not
relevant
in
any
way
to
the
circumstances
of
the
crime.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
no,
we
don't
submit--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--he
read
the
whole
prayer
card
to
the
jury
merely--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--it
was
relevant
to
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
that
the
prayer
card
was
on
the
scene
and
was
strewn
about
his
body
at
the
time
the
crime
occurred.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
they
were
relevant
merely
to
show
in
the
same
way
any
sort
of
analogy
is
relevant...
to
show
the
characteristics
of
the
event
itself,
the
characteristics
of
the
defendant,
as
well
as
the
characteristics--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--that's
the
conclusion
based
upon
the
interpretation
we
submit
the
solicitor
was
actually
trying
to
place
upon
the
prayer
card
itself.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
certainly.
the...
the
evidence...
and
it's
not
contradicted...
that
when
the
defendant
came
upon
the
scene,
mr.
richard
haynes
was
changing
from
some
religious
clothes
at
that
time
and
his...
the
prayer
card,
as
well
as
a
couple
of
bibles,
were
set
out
on
the
park
bench.
the
assault
then
began
to
occur,
and
after
mr.
gathers
had
knocked
the
individual
unconscious
by
beating
him
across
the
head
with
a
bottle,
they
then
went
through
his
belongings
looking
for
something
of
value
to
steal.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
the
prayer
card
was
among
those
belongings.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
which
was
received
in
evidence
in
the
guilt
phase
without
objection.
it
was...
and
the
defendant
was
not
killed
at
that
particular
time.
in
fact,
the...
excuse
me.
the
victim
was
not
killed
at
that
particular
time.
the
defendant
left
and
then
he
returned
to
the
scene,
accomplished
a
further
assault
and--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--after
those
items
had
been
looked
at
and
scattered
about.
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
the
supreme
court
did
not
say
anything
about
error
in
considering
the
evidence.
what
it
said
was
the
extensive...
excuse
me...
the
extensive
comments
on
the
victims
character
violated
booth
v.
maryland
because
they
did
not
see...
read
booth
as
reading
circumstances
of
the
crime
to
allow
such
sort
of
interpretation
on--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--it
never
suggested
that
the
evidence
could
not
be
considered.
that's
correct.
it
merely
interpreted
this
court's--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--there
was
evidence
that
he
looked
at
the
cards,
looked
at
the
materials,
looking
for
something
to
steal.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
there's
no
direct
testimony
the
defendant
sat
and
read
the
card
and
then
made
an
informed
decision
that
he
would
then
kill
the...
the
victim,
mr.
haynes.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
it
occurred
on
a...
a
fall
day,
and
it
occurred
approximately
10:00
o'clock
at
night.
the
evidence--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--we
don't
have
any
information
in
this--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--record
that
he
could
read
small
print--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--on
the
prayer
card.
what
we
do
have
is
testimony
presented
in
the
record
that
they
did
review
these
particular
materials
and
they
could
see
various
items.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
yes,
and
that
the
victim--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--i
wouldn't
infer
that
they
read
exactly
the
entirely
prayer
card,
no.
we
aren't
even
asserting
that.
we're
asserting
that
the
prayer
card
was
merely
utilized
in
this
case
as
an
analogy
about
a
person's
right
to
life
and
right
to
be
free
from
this
sort
of
attack
that
he
had.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
that
issue
was
not
addressed
in
this
particular
case
because
the
defendant
never
sought
to
rebut
any
of
that
information.
he
admitted
it.
in
fact,
during
the--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--my
view
of
the
south
carolina
law
on
the
basis
of
gardner
v.
florida,
the
state
would
have
had
to
have
allowed
the
admission
of
that
testimony
if
the
state
was
pursuing
that
same
sort
of
evidence
affirmatively.
in
the
decision
of
state
v.
gaskins,
which
the
defendant
has
cited--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--that
dealt
with
the
situation
in
which
a
death
row
inmate
was
killed
by
another
inmate
who
was
contracted
by
the
victim's
family
in
the
other
case
to...
to
have
him
murdered.
in
that
case,
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
had
a
situation
that
the
information
was
that
he
had
already
been
sent
to
death
row
for
the
particular
murder,
and
then
based
upon
that
information,
the
culpability
of
the
victim
for
his
particular
heinous
crimes
was
clear
to
the
jury.
the
situation
has
never
been
presented
as
to
whether--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--xxx
is
directly
rebuttable.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
if
that
is
related
to
the
circumstance
of
the
crime,
certainly
he
could--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--one
reading
of
the
gaskins
decision
would
imply
that
it
could
not
be
done,
but
it
was
in
fact
done
in
gaskins.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
it
wasn't
until
the
supreme
court
in
this
particular
decision,
when
it
noted
accord
with...
with
gaskins,
that
they
asserted
possibly
that
that
information
could
not
be
admissible.
however,
the
particular
situation
was
not
raised
in
this
case.
they
never
sought
to
challenge
that.
in
fact,
the
defense
counsel
endorsed
it
in
his
closing
argument.
he
utilized
religion
as
a
sense
of
mitigation
and
utilized
this
defendant's
particular
characteristics
for
religion
and
for
his
christian
faith
should
be
something
that
should
cause
there
to
be
mitigation
in
the
minds
of
the
jury
generally.
in
the
guilt
phase,
he
argued
essentially
that
perceived
mental
illness
on
the
part
of
the
victim
was
something
that
the
jury
should
consider
and
acknowledge.
the
defense
counsel,
we
submit,
also
and
more
fluently
presented
the
situation
as
to
religion
as
to
whether
that
should
be
a
factor
the
jury
should
consider.
and
they
tried
to
utilize
that
in
mitigation
of
this
particular
case.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
yes,
sir.
it
was
after
the
prosecution's
summation.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
the
voter
registration
card
was
not
relevant
to
any
disputed
issue
in
the
case.
it
merely
presented
a
glimpse
of
the
individual
that
was
the
victim
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
no,
we
don't
assert
that.
here
the...
the
voter
registration
card
was
another
piece
of
material
that
was
cast
aside
the
victim's
body
in
this
particular
case.
it's
something
that
the
defendant
could
have
known
and
could
have
considered
at
the
time
before
he
went
back
to
commit
that
particular
crime.
the
voter
registration
card
and
the
fact
that
one
is
a
voter
does
not
necessarily
stand
for
anything
other
than
that
is
a
particular
trait
that
this
victim
had.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
well,
i
think--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--i--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--i
think
in
this
situation
the
voter
registration
card
was
merely
utilized
by
the
prosecution
to
reflect
that
richard
haynes
was
an
individual.
he
was
a
person.
he
wasn't
just
a...
a
carcass,
something
that
the
jury
could
not
ever
consider
or
think
about
in
that
particular
phase.
the
way
he--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--well,
it
does
let
you
consider
who
a
victim
is
we
submit
in
any
particular
case
in
the
same
way
as
if
there
are
two
or
three
victims
in
an
automobile
accident.
the
defendant
might
not
know
how
many
people
are
in
the
car,
but
the
result
of
it
is
he
is
facing
more
culpability
because
of
what
his
action
did.
similarly,
in
this
case,
because
he
was
on
a
park
bench
in
charleston,
south
carolina
was
a
factor
the
jury
could
consider
because
he
thought
he
would
be
free
from
any
sort
of
assault
at
that
time.
that
is
something
that
the
prosecution
should
allow
the
jury
to
consider,
and
because
he
was
practicing
his
religion
at
that
time
and
would
not
have
expected
to
be
accosted
in
this
way,
that
is
something
the
jury
should
be
allowed
to
consider
in
making
a
decision
as
to
the
defendant's
particular
culpability.
the
voter
registration
card,
we
submit,
was
merely
an
analogy
that
the
prosecution
tried
to
use
to
focus
on
that
richard
haynes
was
a
living
person.
at
that
time
he
had
traits
and
he
had
qualities.
the
defendant
in
this
case,
demetrius
gathers,
was
not
we
submit
and
he
was
not
urged
we
submit
to
have
received
the
death
penalty
because
richard
haynes
was
a
registered
voter
or
because
he
was
a
religious
person.
he
was
to
receive
the
death
penalty
because
of
what
he
had
done
to
richard
haynes
who
was
a
human
being
with
particular
traits.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
all
this
evidence
was
admitted
at
the
guilt
phase
without
objection.
it
was
introduced
then
into
the
penalty
phase
without
objection
by
the
defense
attorney,
and
it
wasn't
until
after
the
prosecution's
closing
argument
that
the
defense
attorney
at
that
time
suggested
that
the
prayer
card
be
removed
from
the...
from
going
to
the
jury
at
that
particular
time.
we
submit
the
eighth
amendment
does
not
require
a
state
to
neutralize
and
redact
the
victim
from
the
trial
where
properly
admitted
evidence
reveals
personal
characteristics
of
the
victim.
the
evidence,
we
submit,
is
relevant
to
the
circumstances
of
the
crime.
it's
relevant
to
the
information
as
to
the
particular
moral
culpability
of
the
defendant
by
reflecting
upon
the
person
who
he
chose
to
kill
on
that
particular
date.
in
capital
cases
the
sentencer's
attempt
must
be
to
make
a
unique
and
individualized
judgment
regarding
the
crime
and
regarding
the
penalty
the
defendant
deserves.
the
jury
in
any
capital
case
is
free
to
consider
a
myriad
of
factors
to
determine
whether
death
is
the
appropriate
punishment.
in
this
court's
decisions,
it's
clear
that
the
defendant
has
virtually
free
rein
to
introduce
anything
in
evidence
that
he
considers
mitigating
to
his
particular
factor.
if
the
defendant,
under
this
court's
decisions,
considered
certain
information
to
be
relevant,
its
admissibility
should
be
allowed
to
be
introduced.
the
circumstances
of
the
offense,
we
submit,
must
include
who
the
victim
was
and
what
he
was
doing
at
the
time
the
crime
occurred.
here,
unlike
booth,
the
comments
did
not
focus
on
the
reputation
of
the
victim
and
the
effect
on
his
family,
but
rather
on
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
over
which
the
defendant
could
have
had
knowledge
and
control,
the
apparent
selection
and
choice
of
a
vulnerable
victim
in
september
of
1986.
to
redact
this
information
from
the
penalty
phase
would
make
richard
haynes
a
mere
abstraction,
we
submit,
and
at
most
this
thumbnail
sketch
was
presented
of
richard
haynes
gave
the
jury
a
quick
glimpse
of
the
life
the
defendant
chose
to
extinguish.
as
the
defense
can
humanize
the
defendant
in
any
case,
we
submit
the
prosecution
should
equally
be
able
to
humanize
the
victim
to
allow
for
correct
balance
in
the
criminal
justice
process
and
the
assessment
of
the
offense
from
the
victim's
viewpoint,
we
submit,
is
germane
to
any
jury's
decision
as
to
the
appropriateness
of
the
punishment.
in
this
case
concerns
that
booth
has
as
to
whether
this
information
can
be
guided
were
accomplished
in
this
particular
setting.
during
the
prosecution's
closing
argument,
the
solicitor
advised
the
jury
that
the
sympathy
for
the
victim
is
not
the
way
you
make
a
determination
as
to
the
appropriateness
of
the
punishment.
you
must
focus
on
the
characteristics
of
the
defendant
and
the
circumstances
of
the
particular
crime.
that
is
the
direction
the
prosecutor
was
giving
when
he
made
his
particular
closing
argument.
further,
the
judge,
when
he
gave
his
jury
charge
in
this
case,
said
that
to
make
your
determination,
you
should
refer
to
the
culpability
of
the
defendant
in
his
action
involving
the
death
and
criminal
sexual
conduct
of
the
victim,
richard
haynes.
the
trial
judge
further
charged:
you
should
not
be
swayed
by
prejudice,
by
passion,
or
by
other
bias
or
motive
in
the
particular
jury
charges.
this
information
gave
the
jury
a
guided
choice
as
to
the
utilization
of
this
information
and
the
determination
as
to
the
appropriateness
of
the
penalty
in
the
particular
case.
the
concerns
that
booth
had
of
the
effect
of
the
murder
on
the
victim's
family,
again,
were
not
present
in
this
case.
the
articulation
of
the
members
of
the
victim's
family
in
trying
to
reflect
their
collateral
suffering
that
they
had
as
a
result
of
the
murder
in
the
case
was
not
presented
here.
we
submit
that
booth
should
not
apply
to
this
particular
case
because--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--that's
correct.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
the
characteristics
made
by
the
family
and
the
characteristics
of
the
crime
made
by
the
victim's
family.
that
is
correct,
that
booth
should
be
very
limited
to
those
particular
situations.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
booth
on
its
face
was
probably
not
so
limited
based
upon
certain
language
that
was
within
booth.
however,
footnote
10
of
booth,
we
submit,
allowed
for
that
sort
of
limitation
to
be
done.
and
we
submit
that
that
is
an
appropriate
determination
and
that
these
characteristics
presented
in
this
case,
as
presented
in
other
cases
that
arise
out
of
the
facts
of
the
particular
murder
itself,
are
subject
to
a
proper,
appropriate
comment
by
a
prosecutor.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
in
our
argument
where
we
think
that
booth
is
wrong,
we
think
that
the
characteristics
of
a
victim
independent
of
those
directly
related
to
the
crime
should
weigh
into
a
proper
sentencing
determination
by
the
jury.
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
going
that
far
is
probably
inconsistent
with
the
first
part
of
booth.
that's
correct.
but
the
situation
in
booth,
the
factual
situation
the
court
was
presented
with,
is
certainly
not
the
situation
we're
presenting
here
to
the
court.
that
evidence
went
significantly
beyond
any
relevancy
that
related
to
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
or
particularly
the
circumstances
of
the
particular
victim
in
that
case.
it
put
them
in
a
vulnerable
position.
in
conclusion,
we
would
submit
that
the
eighth
amendment
does
not
preclude
the
types
of
the
comments
that
were
related
to
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
and
the
characteristics
of
the
defendant
in
this
particular
case.
the
prosecutor
was
merely
attempting
to
humanize
the
victim
and
balance
the...
the
sort
of
mitigating
evidence
that
was
presented
in
this
case
dealing
with
the
entire
background
of
the
defendant,
his
relationship
with
his
family
members,
his
ability
to
be
a
rock
to
some
family
members
and
to
be
essentially
a
nonviolent
and
friendly
person
that
was
presented
by
those
particular
family
members
in
this
particular
case.
the
vulnerability
of
the
victim
was
the
essence
of
the
argument
done
this
case,
that
the
victim
was
just
a
member
of
society,
an
individual
that
had
an
identity
was
the
attempted
argument
that
the
prosecutor
was
trying
to
make.
the
use
of
this
info
conveys
our
common
humanity
with
those
who
suffer
from
this
sort
of
crime
and
keeps
us
from
thinking
of
them
as
faceless
abstractions.
we
submit
that
richard
haynes,
who
was
brutally
murdered
in
1986,
was
a
real
and
a
unique
person.
it
is
only
just
that
the
jury
should
be
permitted
to
consider
that
fact
in
making
its
determinations.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
i
just
have
a
few
points
on
rebuttal,
mr.
chief
justice.
concerning
the...
the
lighting
in
the
area,
would
refer
the
court
to
joint
appendix
page
26
and
27
which
is
the
testimony
of
mr.
hardrick
on
what
he
saw
when
he
came
upon
the
scene
that
the
defendant...
that
the
victim
had
a
bible
and
some
paper,
that
it
was
just
sitting
on
the
bench,
and
that
he
had
occasion
to
go
through
those
belongings.
we
would
submit--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--it's
not
clear
that
you
could
see
to
read
the
card--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--xxx
time.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
there
was
testimony
that
it
was
dark.
there
was
also
testimony
that
on
down
the
path,
accomplices
could
see
what
the
defendant
was
doing
to
the
victim.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
that's
correct.
and
there's
also--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--we'll,
he
testified
that--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--if
you
can
recognize
money,
you
can
probably
recognize
other
items
that
you
took
out
and
you
threw
around
the
area
we
would
submit--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--including
a
bible
and
other
items.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
no.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
no,
that's
not
our
point
at
all.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
that's
correct.
the...
that's
our
basic
point.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
it's
also
our
point
that
the
defendant
knew--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--that
he
appeared
to
be
a
religious
person
at
the
time
he
committed
the
acts,
that
that
was
some
knowledge
that
he
had
at
the
time
and
during
the
accomplishment
of
the
acts.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
well,
i
don't
know
it
the
defendant
knew
he
was
a--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--there
was
no
evidence
in
particular
that
they
knew
whether
he
was
a
christian
or
not.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
just
that
he
was
a
religious
person
with
those
materials
at
the
park
bench
at
that
time.
and
that
was
something
the
defendant
knew
before
the
final
blow
was
struck.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
we
only
know
that
he--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--xxx
voter
registration
card
was
taken
out
and
placed
upon--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--there
is
no
testimony
that
by
anyone
that
they
particularly
read
the
card,
just
that
it
was
taken
out.
it
was
on
the
scene,
maliciously
threw...
thrown
beside
the
body.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
that
it
reflected
that
it
was--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--a
part
of
the
victim.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
apart
from--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--he
had
a
bible
set
out
on
the
scene.
he
had
angels
set
out
on
the
scene.
he
has
these
religious
tracts
on
the
scene,
and
at
the
time
they
came
upon
him,
he
was
changing
from
apparently
a
robe...
it
was
actually
a
sheet
i
believe...
and--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--that's
correct.
he
could...
in
fact,
there
were
two
bibles
recovered
from
the
particular--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--there's
a
great
deal
on
the
card--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--no,
i
don't
think
it
would
have
taken
several
minutes,
but
it
would
have
probably
taken
between
45
seconds
to
a
minute
reading
that
card.
but,
again,
that
card
was
already
in
evidence
for
the
jury--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--but
what
the
card
stood
for
we
submit
is
a
fair
chance
in
life.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
this
is
the
kind
of
character
that
any
potential
victim
is,
that
they're
looking
for
a
fair
chance
in
life
and
that
that
fair
chance
they
would
also
give
another
individual.
that
is
essentially
a
standard--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--that
each
of
us
morally
looked
to
in
making
any
decision.
that
is
a
standard
that
society
looks
to
to
give
each
individual
a
fair
chance.
that
is
what
the
solicitor
was
doing.
he
was
utilizing
that
card
for
rhetorical
comment
not
saying
that
the
defendant
ascribed
to
each
and
every
part
of
that
card,
but
it
did
reflect
what
an
individual
was
and
it
did
reflect--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--that
this
individual
was
a
person.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
he
could
read.
there
is
matters
in
the
record
that
he
did
go
to
school.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
that
they
did
read
the
particular
card--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--there's
evidence
in
the
record
that
they
looked
through
the
materials
at
that
particular
time.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
that's
correct,
looking
for
something
to
steal.
i
have
no
further
responses.
