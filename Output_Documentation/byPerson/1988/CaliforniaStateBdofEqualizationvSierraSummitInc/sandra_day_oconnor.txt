justice
o'connor
but
we
don't
have
to
reach
that
question
here
and
indeed,
probably
can't.
all
we
can
decide
in
view
of
your
failure
to
appeal
on
the
goggin
question
below
in
the
first
litigation,
all
we
have
before
us
is
whether
you
can
be
held
in
contempt
for
the
present
application
of
the
tax
to
the
subsequent
purchaser.
isn't
that
all
we
can
do?
justice
o'connor
well,
at
this
stage
the
liquidation
is
over.
the
assets
have
been
sold
and
someone
else
has
acquired
them
and
is
in
business.
it's
just
very
hare
for
me
to
see
why,
under
any
interpretation
of
the
statute,
it
shouldn't
be
taxable.
justice
o'connor
the
sale
is
over.
justice
o'connor
your
client
acquired
the
assets
and
now
wants
to
rent
the
skis.
justice
o'connor
i
guess
other
courts
have
held
that
the
liquidation
sale
itself
is
doing
business
and
can
be
taxed
under
960.
