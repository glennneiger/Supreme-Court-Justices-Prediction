justice
stevens
mr.
tyler,
can
i
interrupt
you
to
go
back
to
the
problem
that
some
of
us...
some
of
my
colleagues
raised
at
the
outset?
exactly
what...
supposing
we
agree
with
you
that
goggin
is
incorrectly
decided
and
all
of
the
legal
points
you're
making.
precisely
what
relief
do
we
grant
in
the...
in
this
case?
what
is
the
order
you're
seeking
here?
justice
stevens
would
that
require
a
vacation
of
the
injunction,
too?
i
mean,
it
is
the
law
of
the
case
that
you
violated
the
injunction,
according
to
the
court
of
appeals.
and...
and...
i...
i'm
still
not
quite
clear
on
what
happens
if
we
agree
with
all
of
your
legal
analysis,
but
nevertheless
feel
that
as
the
court
of
appeals
held,
you
did
not
comply
with
the
terms
of
an
injunction
which
may
have
been
erroneously
entered.
how...
how...
i'm
just
not
quite
clear
on
what
happens.
justice
stevens
but
if
that's
true,
we
don't
reach
all
the
goggin
issues,
if
that's
true.
justice
stevens
i
must
confess,
i'm
still
puzzled
about
how
reversing
goggin
helps
you
in
this
case.
maybe
i'm
dense,
but
i
just
don't--
justice
stevens
--and
of
course
you
might
have
won
if
you'd
objected
to
the
entry
of
the
injunction,
or
appealed
from
that.
justice
stevens
that
goes
to
the
question
whether
the
use
tax
can
be
imposed
by
the
leases
by
the
purchaser
of
the
equipment.
justice
stevens
but
if
you're
right
on
goggin,
your
fundamental
position,
you
really
could
have
objected
to
the
injunction
against
the
collection
of
the
sales
tax,
couldn't
you?
justice
stevens
but
you
didn't
read
the
whole
sentence...
have
liability
in
connection
with
the
particular
transaction
before
the
court.
justice
stevens
and
this
transaction
that
the
tax
was
imposed
on
occurred
quite
a
while
later,
didn't
it?
justice
stevens
well,
i
understand
that,
but
they
didn't
actually
try
to
collect
it
until
sometime
later.
justice
stevens
after
there
had
been
leases
of
the
equipment.
justice
stevens
well,
i
understand
that
legal
argument
and
the
party
from
whom
they're
trying
to
collect
it
was
not
a
party
to
the
case
that
you
read
from
the
pleading.
justice
stevens
well,
the
district...
the
judge
who
entered
the
injunction
didn't
think
so,
but
apparently
the
court
of
appeals
did.
justice
stevens
but
then
is
it
not
correct
that
either
the
meaning
or
the
accuracy
of
the
goggin
doctrine
is
before
us
because
that's
what
illuminates
the
meaning
of
the
underlying
order.
and
is
it
also
not
true
that
in
your
brief
in
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
you
did
not
suggest
that
we
would
not
be
able
to
reach
the
goggin
issue?
you
suggested
it
wouldn't
affect
the
outcome,
but
you
did
seem
to
agree
at
that
time
that
the
goggin
rule
was
before
the
court
under
the
questions
presented.
justice
stevens
let
me
just
make
one
other...
ask
you
one
other
question
about
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
the
court
of
appeals,
as
i
read
judge
noonan's
opinion,
seemed
to
think
that
the
question
whether
goggin
was
wrongly
decided
was
open,
but
they...
but
as
i
read
him
he
says,
but
we're
not
going
to...
we,
as
a
panel,
unlike
a
court
sitting
en
banc,
we
don't
have
the
power
to
reexamine
and
we're
not
inclined
to
change
a
rule
that's
been
in
force
for
over
30
years
anyway.
but
as
i
read
that
opinion,
i
thought
that
the
court
of
appeals
considered
the
issue
of
whether
goggin
correctly
stated
the
rule
was
something
that,
had
it
been
sitting
en
banc,
they
could
have
passed
upon.
justice
stevens
it
is
not?
justice
stevens
right,
they're
bound
by
it
in
a
precedential
sense
and
as
a
panel
they
don't
have
the
power
to
overrule
a
ninth
circuit
precedent
that's
been
on
the
books
for
30
years.
but
if
they
didn't
feel
bound
by
stare
decisis,
it
would
seem
to
me
they
would
have
said
that
was
an
issue
they
could
have
confronted.
at
least,
that's
the
way
i
had
thought
the
opinion
read.
