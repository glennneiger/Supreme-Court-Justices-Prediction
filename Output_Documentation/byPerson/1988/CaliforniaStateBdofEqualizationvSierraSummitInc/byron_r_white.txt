suppose
there
was
no
section
960.
justice
white
suppose
there
was
no
960?
or
to
put
it
another
way,
why
did
congress
think
it
was
necessary
to
pass
960?
justice
white
well,
what
if
he
was?
justice
white
is
the
problem
that
the
bankruptcy
trustee
is
a
federal
instrumentality
and
there's
some
argument
that
you
can't
tax
a
federal
instrumentality?
justice
white
well,
did
any
court
ever
hold
that?
justice
white
uh-huh.
so
we
really
needed
960
to
really
make
sure
that
the
states
could
tax,
if
the
business
was
being
operated?
justice
white
so
they
didn't
need
960?
justice
white
so
absent
960,
your
submission
is
that
the
sales
tax
could
surely
have
been
imposed
on
the
sale
of
this
estate.
justice
white
i
thought
you
said
that
we
had
already
decided
that
there
wasn't
any
such
thing.
justice
white
no,
in
this
bankruptcy
situation.
that
you
could
tax
trustees
and
transactions
just
normally,
even
absent
960.
justice
white
well,
that's
sort
of
like
a
defense
and
if
you
don't
ever
raise
it,
you
can't
just
raise
it
any
time
you
want
to.
justice
white
no,
you
didn't.
well,
you
didn't
raise
it
when...
before
we
granted
certiorari.
