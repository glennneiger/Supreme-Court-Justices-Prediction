chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
have
argument
next
in
no.
88-681,
tyler
v.
david
ray
jenkins.
no,
i'm
sorry,
california
board
of
education
v.
sierra
summit.
mr.
tyler,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
tyler,
there
is
kind
of
a
procedural
wrinkle
in
this
case,
isn't
there,
in
that...
it
comes
up
because
your
client
in
effect
was
held
in
contempt
for
disobeying
an
injunction?
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case,
or
the
bankruptcy
courts,
did
more
than
just
interpret
the
terms
of
the
injunction?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
then
the
bankruptcy
appellate
panel
reversed
that,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
this
all
part
of
one
proceeding?
was...
is
the
proceeding
we
have
here
before
us
now
basically
just
a
continuation
of
the
proceeding
in
which
the
injunction
was
entered?
chief
justice
rehnquist
okay.
i
know
you
intend
to
argue
the
merits
of
the
case
and
please
feel
free
to
do
so.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
tyler.
mr.
jenkins?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
me
in
its
opinion
to
have
reached
the
merits.
do
you
disagree
with
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
at
great
length...
not
much
else.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well
certainly,
we
aren't
going
to
ordinarily
take
a
case
in
order
to
construe
something
that
the
ninth
circuit
said
40
years
ago.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out,
under
our
tuttle
case
it's
your
obligation,
it
it's
nonjurisdictional
point
you
want
to
raise,
in
your
response
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
to
point
out
that
we
can't
reach
the
issue
that
the
petitioner
seeks
to
reach.
chief
justice
rehnquist
xxx.
chief
justice
rehnquist
let
me
just
refer
you
to
one
part
of
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion,
at
page
a4
of
the
petition
where
judge
noonan
says
the
board
suggests
that
goggin
ii
was
wrongly
decided.
the
second
and
fifth
circuits
are
in
the
board's
corner,
but
this
circuit
was
aware
of
the
second
circuit's
reasoning
and
refused
to
follow
it
and
the
supreme
court,
denying
certiorari,
accepted
a
certain
regionalism
in
the
administration
of
federal
bankruptcy
law.
then
it
goes
on
to
say,
it's
not
within
the
power
of
this
panel
and
not
within
its
heart
to
change
a
rule
of
this
circuit
that
has
been
in
force
for
over
30
years.
it
seems
to
me
if
they
were
saying
that
the
merits
of
this
question
of
whether
the
state
can
tax,
levy
a
use
tax
or
a
sales
tax,
were
simply
not
before
it
at
all
they
wouldn't
have
used
that
language.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
i
believe
that,
but
it
seems
to
me
the
reason
they
say
they're
not
going
to
change
it
is
because
the
panel
can't
overrule
an
earlier
decision
and
doesn't
want
to
overrule
it,
not
that
the
parties
before
them
have
no...
have
no
right
to
have
a
decision
on
the
merits.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
didn't
mean
to
prevent
you
from
going
on
to
your
argument
on
the
merits.
chief
justice
rehnquist
was
960
enacted
as
part
of
the
chandler
act?
chief
justice
rehnquist
when...
when
was
it
enacted?
chief
justice
rehnquist
your
argument
would
make
a
lot
more
sense
if
mcculloch
against
maryland
still
stood
as
law
in
all
its
language,
rather
than
having
been
toned
down
much
later.
you
know,
the
idea
that
the
power
to
tax
is
the
power
to
destroy
is
no
longer
accepted
by
the
court.
it's
treated
on
a
more
pragmatic
basis,
don't
you
think?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jenkins.
the
case
is
submitted.
