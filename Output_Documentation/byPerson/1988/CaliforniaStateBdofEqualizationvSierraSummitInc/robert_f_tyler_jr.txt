mr.
robert
f.
tyler,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
issue
in
this
case
is
a
proper
interface
between
federal
bankruptcy
power
and
the
fundamental
sovereign
rights
of
the
states
to
tax
commerce
and
property
within
their
borders.
the
case
concerns
the
ninth
circuit's
holding
that
a
state
may
not
tax
a
private
party's
subsequent
commercial
rentals
of
property
purchased
at
a
bankruptcy
liquidation
sale
by
reason
of
the
purported
preemptive
effect
of
28
u.s.c.
section
960
and
the
purported
unconstitutional
interference
such
taxation
is
seen
as
imposing
upon
the
bankruptcy
processes.
the
state
contends
that
this
ruling
is
in
error
for
three
reasons.
first,
whatever
it
is,
section
960
is
obviously
not
a
clear
expression
of
preemptive
intent
stated
to
be
necessary
to
preempt
state
taxation
under
this
court's
ruling
in
swarts
v.
hammer.
second,
whatever
the
limits
of
intergovernmental
immunity,
the
imposition
of
a
nondiscriminatory
tax
on
a
liquidation
sale
or
the
purchaser
therefrom
certainly
does
not
cross
them.
third,
whatever
the
limits
of
bankruptcy
jurisdiction,
a
bankruptcy
court
clearly
has
no
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
a
controversy
between
a
state
and
a
nonbankruptcy
party
concerning
the
taxability
of
transactions
occurring
long
after
the
bankruptcy
is
closed.
mr.
robert
f.
tyler,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
f.
tyler,
jr.
yes,
i
do,
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
injunction
is
circumscribed
by
the
judgment
underlying
it
and
that
judgment
in
turn
is
circumscribed
by
the
pleadings
brought
by
the
parties
underlying
the
adversary
complaint.
that
pleading,
in
turn,
was
brought
by
the
debtor...
if
one
will...
or
the
trustee,
state
receiver's,
under
bankruptcy
code
section
505.
in
turn,
bankruptcy
code
section
505
only
allows
adjudication
of
the
debtor
and
the
estate's
rights...
tax
rights
and
obligations...
on
property
in
the
bankruptcy
estate.
that's
all
that
the
trustee--
mr.
robert
f.
tyler,
jr.
--no.
the
jurisdiction
permitted
is
circumscribed
in
the
bankruptcy
code.
mr.
robert
f.
tyler,
jr.
that
was
not
the
case
presented
in
this
situation.
the
bankruptcy
court
clearly
did
not
mean
to
exceed
the
jurisdictional
grant
in
505.
mr.
robert
f.
tyler,
jr.
yes.
the
bankruptcy
court
construed
the
judgment
to
the
contrary.
it
found
that
this
was
not
a
contemptuous
action
because
its
prior
order
was
not
meant
to
have
the
ambit
urged
upon
it
by
respondent
herein.
mr.
robert
f.
tyler,
jr.
yes,
but
the
bankruptcy
court
itself
obviously
knew
what
it
had
in
mind
in
framing
its
original
order
and
i
think
that
that
construction
is
one
which
should
be
paid
deference
on
appeal.
mr.
robert
f.
tyler,
jr.
but
the
bankruptcy
court...
what
you
have
here
is
a
nebulous
phrase.
it's
included
by
some
draftsmen
in
the
judgment
ultimately
entered
by
the
court,
the
"or
other
persons".
mr.
robert
f.
tyler,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
understand
what
you
mean
by
the
ultimate
user.
mr.
robert
f.
tyler,
jr.
i
believe
so.
i
think
you
can
assent
to
that.
mr.
robert
f.
tyler,
jr.
no.
the
judge
had
no
intent
to
affect
the
relationship
between
respondent
and
its--
mr.
robert
f.
tyler,
jr.
--if
in
fact
that
was
the
intent
of
the
court,
the
bankruptcy
court,
to
enter
such
a
judgment,
yes.
well--
mr.
robert
f.
tyler,
jr.
--it
was
clear
that
the
intent
of
the
parties
and
the
understanding
of
the
parties
and
the
bankruptcy
court
in
1983,
when
the
original
adversary
judgment
was
entered,
was
simply
that
it
only
related...
that
judgment
only
related
to
the
taxability
of
the
debtor
and
the
estate
through
the
trustee
and
that...
it
begs
reason--
mr.
robert
f.
tyler,
jr.
--no.
that's
not...
i
would
beg
to
differ.
under
res
judicata
principles
what
the
court
essentially
would
be
holding
us
to
there
is
to
adjudicate
hypothetical
controversies
with
the
trustee
concerning
taxability
of
transactions
of
third
parties
and
clearly
the
trustee
has
no
desire
to
do
that
and
clearly
the
board
has
no
desire
to
do
that,
considering
that
in
1983
all
of
this
exists
as
a
mere
hypothetical.
mr.
robert
f.
tyler,
jr.
i...
it's
hard
to
answer
that
question.
what
happened
was
that
the
bankruptcy
was
opened,
dismissed,
reopened
again
for
the
purpose
of
the
original
adversary
proceeding
by
the
trustee,
dismissed
again,
two
and
a
half
years
later
it's
reopened
again
by
sierra
summit
for
the
purpose
of
ostensibly
bringing
the
instant
contempt
citation.
in
one
sense
it
is
a
continuation,
but
in
another
sense
it
is
very
attenuated.
mr.
robert
f.
tyler,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
main
fault
with
the
ninth
circuit's
ruling
in
this
case
exists
and
the
cases
upon
which
it
rests...
goggins
i
and
goggins
ii...
rests
upon
their
interpretation
that
28
u.s.c.
section
960
bars
the
taxation
of
a
liquidation
sale
or
property
rights
that
a
purchaser
acquires
therein.
whatever
it
is,
section
960
is
not
the
clear
expression
of
congressional
preemptive
intent
to
preclude
state
taxation
in
this
area.
if
anything,
section
960
is
an
affirmation
of
tax
liability,
establishing
the
liability
of
the
bankruptcy
estate
for
all
state
and
local
taxes
otherwise
applicable
to
its
operations.
congress
meant,
by
enactment
of
this
statute,
to
advance
two
specific
purposes.
first,
to
create
a
level
playing
field
by
equalizing
tax
burdens
between
bankruptcy
estates
and
commercial
competitors
outside
the
bankruptcy
protection.
second,
it
meant
to
ensure
the
continued
flow
of
tax
revenues
to
the
states
to
fund
the
services
and
protections
that
those
states
afford.
mr.
robert
f.
tyler,
jr.
excuse
me?
mr.
robert
f.
tyler,
jr.
because
the
courts,
previous
to
the
enactment
of
960,
had
been
engaging
in
essentially
socratic
dialogue,
splitting
hairs
over
whether
or
not
a
bankruptcy
trustee
was
doing
business
or
not
doing
business.
mr.
robert
f.
tyler,
jr.
they
were
finding
states'
tax
statutes
inapplicable
on
the--
mr.
robert
f.
tyler,
jr.
--conceivably
that
would
be
the
situation.
mr.
robert
f.
tyler,
jr.
goggin
ii
did.
mr.
robert
f.
tyler,
jr.
no.
because
this
court
had
previously
held
in
swarts
v.
hammer
that
the
general
rule,
the
presumption
is
taxability
of
bankruptcy
estates,
and
absent
a
clear
expression
by
congress--
mr.
robert
f.
tyler,
jr.
--no,
they
did
not
need
it,
but
the
courts
had
been
mired
in
a
construction...
essentially,
a
fruitless
construction...
splitting
hairs
over
what
was
the
conduct
of
business,
what
wasn't
the
conduct
of
business.
the
focus,
prior
to
960,
as
always,
has
been
a
focus
on
whether
or
not
the
transaction
or
property
in
question
is
taxable
under
state
law.
mr.
robert
f.
tyler,
jr.
the
only
question
remaining
then
would
be
one
of
intergovernmental
tax
immunity
and
that
is
the
only
question
that
actually
is
in
this
case,
according
to
our
view
and
we
believe
that
that's
a
well-founded
view.
mr.
robert
f.
tyler,
jr.
as
intergovernmental
tax
immunity?
mr.
robert
f.
tyler,
jr.
yes,
that's
true.
but
one
still
ends
up
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
a
conflict
between
the
fundamental
purposes
of
the
bankruptcy
code
and
the
efforts
of
the
state
to
tax.
it's
essentially
a
tenth
amendment
analysis
at
that
point.
going
back,
the
immediate
reason
for
enactment
of
960
by
congress
was
simple:
to
clarify
previously
confused
law
in
an
area
by
providing
a
rule
of
construction
whereby
the
taxability
of
an
activity
conducted
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
bankruptcy
court
would
be
determined
by
reference
to
state
law
rather
than
by
distinguishing
whether
or
not
it
was
conducted
by
a
trustee
or
receiver.
my
opponents
assert
that
960
was
meant
to
have
preemptive
intent
with
regard
to
state
taxation
of
liquidating
activities
by
congress'
inclusion
of
language,
"conduct
of
business"
within
the
terminology
of
that
statute.
they
argue
that
that
terminology
was
meant
to
resurrect
and
maintain
a
pre-act
distinction
in
the
act
between
liquidating
and
nonliquidating
activities
and
by
innuendo
to
retain
a
purported
bar
to
state
and
federal
taxation
on
liquidation
activities.
the
argument's
invalid
for
three
reasons.
first,
it's
factually
incorrect,
for
even
assuming
that
such
a
distinction
was
made
under
the
act,
there
was
no
bar
on
taxation
of
liquidation
activities.
the
hendersonville
case
cited
in
my
brief
amply
demonstrates
that
a
taxation
on
property
held
in
the
liquidating
state
was
taxable.
similarly,
the
mason/tire
case,
although
ultimately
holding
that
no
tax
was
due,
found
that
there
was
no
immunity
to
such
taxation
but
found
that
as
a
matter
of
construction
of
ohio
law
that
a
personal
property
tax
on
the
monetary
proceeds
from
a
liquidation
sale
was
not
due
and
owing
under
ohio
law,
as
a
matter
of
ohio
construction.
the
argument
ultimately
rests
on
a
totally
improper
preemption
analysis
posited
by
negative
innuendo
from
what
is
otherwise
an
affirmative
statement
of
tax
liability.
as
before,
swarts
demands
a
clear
expression
of
congressional
preemptive
intent.
swarts
is
in
line
with
the
recent
cases
by
this
court,
most
recently
exemplified
by
the
puerto
rico
decision
cited
in
my
brief,
holding
essentially
that
the
states'
exercise
of
their
sovereign
rights
may
be
abridged
only
by
the
clear
and
direct
statement
of
congressional
intent
to
do
so.
here
we
are
talking,
of
course,
the
most
fundamental
of
those
rights
essentially,
the
state's
very
existence...
the
right
to
tax
to
create
the
lifeblood
by
which
the
services
and
protections
demanded
by
bankruptcy
estates
are
provided.
the
clear
expression
here
is
asserted
to
lie
in
hidden
subtlety
of
meaning,
a
purported
term
of
arts,
but
it
congress
meant
a
preemptive
effect
to
take
place
here,
it
should
have
said
so
in
direct
language,
such
as
doing
business,
except
that
the
estate
shall
not
be
liable
for
any
state,
local
or
federal
tax
on
liquidation
activities.
congress
intended
to
create
a
level
playing
field,
and
at
worst
it
left
one
ambiguity
as
to
the
extent
of
that
field.
that
the
ambiguity
exists
is
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
i
stand
in
front
of
the
court
today,
for
the
conflict
of
the
circuits
essentially
created
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
and
the
fact
that
you
have
a
myriad
of
cases
cited
on
both
sides,
by
both
myself
and
my
opponents,
as
to
whether
or
not
section
960
includes
liquidating
activities.
in
practical
terms,
the
ninth
circuit's
construction
differentiating
liquidating
activities
from
the
definition
of
business
leads
to
absurd
results
and
creates
a
rule
which
is
both
impossible
to
consistently
and
rationally
apply.
the
inconsistent
application
of
this
rule
is
most
amply
demonstrated
within
the
ninth
circuit
itself,
for
in
united
states
v.
sampsell,
considering
federal
taxation
of
liquidating
activities,
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
liquidating
activities
are
included
within
the
ambit
of
960.
now,
there's
no
rational
differentiation
one
can
make
between
federal
and
state
taxation
for
the
purposes
of
the
instant
analysis.
the
code
at
least,
and
the
act
since
1850,
certainly
made
no
distinction
between
federal
and
state
taxation.
and
the
fact
that
one
is
undertaken
under
a
supremacy
clause
analysis,
whereas
the
other
one
is
under
statutory
construction,
is
really
of
no
regard,
for
the
analysis
is
the
same:
harmonization
to
avoid
conflict.
if
in
fact...
i
would
note
that
the
contrary
construction
to
the
ninth
circuit's
analysis
is
one
of
common
commercial
usage
and
is
one
given
terms
in
other
statutes
such
as
the
internal
revenue
code.
this
court
noted
in
magruder,
cited
in
my
brief,
that
the
term
"doing
business"
is
one
of
broad
import,
fairly
limitless,
and
specifically
stated
that
liquidation
activities
were
included
within
that
phrase.
obviously
sampsell
stands
for
the
same
proposition.
but
perhaps
the
greatest
fault
of
the
goggins
rules
is
the
fact
that
there's
no
rational
test
for
differentiate...
by
which
one
can
differentiate
liquidating
from
nonliquidating
activities.
in
this
case,
china
peak
is
a
debtor
in
possession
operated
by
a
state
receiver.
it
filed
a
bankruptcy
proceeding
to
essentially
gain
protection
from
the
state
receivership
and
then
dismissed
it
shortly
after
the
liquidation
sale...
or
what
was
termed
a
liquidation
sale...
took
place.
it
was
filed
under
chapter
11,
but
no
plan
was
ever
filed.
no
trustee
was
ever
appointed.
it
was
never
adjudicated.
it
was
not
brought
under
chapter
7.
it
was
not
even
what
would
now
be
termed
as
a
liquidating
11.
the
sale
was
not
for
the
benefit
of
the
creditors
of
the
estate
but,
by
order
of
the
bankruptcy
court,
was
passed
directly
through
to
the
state
receivership
to
be
distributed
by
the
state
receivership
to
whatever
creditors
or
persons
were
deemed
worthy
of
receipt
therein.
the
sale
here,
because
it
was
done
in
bankruptcy,
was
felt
to
be
a
liquidation
sale
and
because
of
that
was
exempt
from
the
same
taxation
given
for
the
benefit
of
the
state
receivership,
which
would
have
borne
it
in
the
first
place,
had
it
been
conducted
by
it
directly.
the
goggin
cases
are
also
good
examples
of
the
problem
with
the
goggin
rules,
for
there,
mr.
goggin
as
trustee
took
a
debtor's
inventory,
consisting
of
partly
finished
goods,
utilized
the
debtor's
work
force
and
plant
to
continue
finishing
those
goods
and
then
sold
them.
obviously,
that
is
the
normal
course
of
business
operations
for
the
debtor,
or
under
any
common
construction
of
the
term
and
phrase,
yet
it
was
held
to
be
a
liquidation
and
thus
immune
from
state
taxation.
the
oklahoma
trustee
amicus
here,
by
analogy,
argues
that,
as
long
as
he
is
not
operating
under
an
order
under
section
721,
that
he
should
be
regarded
as
a
liquidator.
but
consider
the
amicus
banks,
who
argue
that
receivership
should
be
taken
as
liquidating
entitles
also.
this
court
has
previously
refused
to
draw
such
a
distinction
in
michigan
v.
michigan
trust,
where
a
liquidating
receivership,
if
one
will,
was
still
held
to
be
a
receivership
and
properly
subject
to
state
taxation
on
receivers.
but
perhaps
the
most
pernicious
hypothetical
that
one
can
draw
is
in
fact
a
chapter
11
11>
["]
by
a
retail
grocery
chain
or
hotel
chain
consisting
of
a...
of
a
multiple
series
of
outlets.
the
hypothetical
in
particular
is
one
of
16,
possibly
17,
of
say
18
or
19
outlets
where
they
are
sold
at
sales
deemed
to
be
a
liquidation
sale,
because
they
are
virtually
all
of
the
assets,
not
within
the
ordinary
course
of
business,
but
providing
the
debtor
with
a
sufficient
amount
of
cash
to
successfully
reorganize
and
come
out
of
chapter
11.
you've
now
come
full
circle,
for
the
debtor
obviously
falls
directly
within
the
language
of
section
960
but
yet
has
been
held
to
be
immune
from
taxation
because
it's
liquidating
as
opposed
to
operating
a
business.
two
cited
cases,
cited
by
both
of
us
for
contrary
rules,
also
demonstrate
the
perniciousness
of
the
rule.
in
glick
v.
missouri
you
have
a
bankruptcy
trustee
who
is
held
liable
for
unemployment
taxes
by
reason
of
section
960,
or
actually
who
was
allowed
to...
who
was
stated
to
be
subject,
960
notwithstanding.
under
goggin
this
is
arguably
an
incorrect
statement
of
the
law,
but
it's
an...
an
absurd
application,
because
there
is
absolutely
no
reason
advanced
why
a...
a
liquidation
trustee
should
be
exempt
from
paying
unemployment
taxes
on
the
debtor's
employees.
there
is
absolutely
no
reason
to
deny
those
employees
unemployment
insurance
benefits
because
they
were
operating
under
a
liquidating
trustee
rather
than
an
operating
trustee.
similarly,
in
cusado
the
eleventh
circuit's
wholesaler
liquor
case,
liquor
taxes
were
imposed
at
the
wholesale
level
on
the
debtor
and
because
of
this,
under
the
goggin
analysis,
were
held
to
be
improperly
applied
and
barred,
yet
there's
no
practical
purpose
inuring
to
the
benefit
of
the
bankruptcy
estate
from
this.
under
goggin,
the
only...
under
this
analysis,
only
the
estate
is
benefited
by
receiving
more
dollars
by
avoiding
taxes
that
a
regular
business
would
otherwise
have
to
pay.
this
is
done
so
that
a
retailer
receives
a
better
price
from
the
estate
and
arguably
makes
a
better
profit
at
the
retail
level.
but
they
are
not
going
to
provide
the
services
and
protection,
that
the
state
has
to
provide
those.
the
ultimate
effect...
the
ultimate
effect
of
the
entire
analysis
is
that,
essentially,
an
unevil...
an
uneven
playing
field,
the
uneven
playing
field
decried
by
congress
has
been
created
and
you
have
liquor
entering
the
commercial
transactions
of
the
state
of
florida,
which
surfers
absolutely
no
tax
burden
whatsoever.
all
of
these
results
are
produced
by,
in
essence,
resurrecting...
quibbling
over
much
the
same
terms
of
art
that
section
960
was
designed
to
obviate
by
essentially
reading
them
back
into
the
statute.
all
of
this
creates
a
rule
whereby
tax-advantaged
goods
are
created
where
to
do
so
directly
violates
the
concept
of
a
level
playing
field,
the
concept
underlying
the
promulgation
of
section
960
in
the
first
place
and
all
without
advancing
any
discernible
federal
purpose.
the
last
point
underscores
the
next.
it
in
fact
there
is
no
preemption
under
960,
the
only
bar
is
intergovernmental
immunity.
yet
whatever,
these
concepts
mean,
they
are
clearly
not
reached
here.
at
issue
in
this
case
is
a
nondiscriminatory
tax,
broadly
based,
applicable
to
all
retail
sales
in
the
state
of
california.
it
neither
falls
on
a
federal
instrumentality
nor
imposes
a
cognizable
burden
on
the
processes
of
the
federal
court.
one
need
only
look
at
who
is
paying
the
tax.
there
are
no
federal
dollars
involved
in
this.
the
taxes
come
out
of
the
estate.
the
trustee
doesn't
even
pay
the
taxes,
he
passes
them
through
to
the
estate.
who
is
complaining
in
this
case?
not
the
federal
government.
we
have
private
parties
before
us.
private
parties
who,
simply
put,
want
a
better
deal
than
they
can
get
in
the
normal
course
of
commercial
discourse.
simply
put,
they
want
a
bar
to
the
efforts
of
the
state
to
equalize
the
tax
burdens
on
the
property
they
own.
they
don't
stand
in
the
shoes
of
the
government,
to
use
the
terms
of
this
court,
and
there's
simply
no
federal
interest
in
barring
the
state's
efforts
to
equalize
that
tax
burden.
this
court
has
recently
declared
its
solicitousness
of
the
efforts
of
states
to
raise
revenues
in
this
manner
in
the
united
states
v.
washington
case.
conversely,
there
is
absolutely
no
tax
on
a
government
instrumentality,
in
that
a
government
instrumentality
is
not
involved
in
a
liquidation
sale.
goggin
ii
speaks
of
the
trustee.
under
united
states
v.
new
mexico,
the
test
is
whether
or
not
a
trustee
is
incorporated
into
the
government
structure.
the
trustee
is
paid
by
the
estate,
not
by
the
government.
the
trustee
is
a
private
individual,
operating
his
own
business
interests
rather
than
being
an
employee
of
the
federal
government
and
he's
acting
to
advance
the
private
purposes
of
the
creditors
of
the
estate,
rather
than
those
of
the
federal
government.
goggin
ii
speaks
of
the
liquidation
sale
as
the
process.
yet,
since
the
promulgation
of
the
code,
section
363
in
specific,
the
sale
is...
the
sale
is
by
the
trustee,
not
the
court
and
obviously
one
can
speak
of
levy
and
those...
those
cases
as
holding
that
there
is
a
federal
instrumentality
involved,
but
since
the
promulgation
of
the
code
that
analysis
is
no
longer
correct.
there
are
two
purposes
of
bankruptcy,
only
one
of
which
is
arguably
affected
by
the
instant
taxation
efforts
and
that
is
the
efficient
administration
and
distribution
of
the
bankrupt
property.
yet
the
efficiency
of
the
administration
and
distribution
is
not
what's
impaired.
the
impairment
raised
by
respondents
rises
solely
from
the
equalization
of
the
tax
burden
to
support
the
services
and
protection
that
that
property
receives.
that
equalization
effort
is
felt
to
be
a
permissible
abridgment
on
the
exercise
of
enumerated
powers
as
held...
as
stated,
generally,
in
massachusetts
v.
united
states
and
swarts
v.
hammer.
mr.
robert
f.
tyler,
jr.
the
order
i'm
seeking
is
a
dissolution
of
the
contempt
citation.
mr.
robert
f.
tyler,
jr.
well,
obviously
our
contention
is
that
the
injunction
entered
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
taxation
activities
at
issue
in
this
case.
the
injunction
entered--
mr.
robert
f.
tyler,
jr.
--well,
under
the
goggin
analysis
you
do
have
to
reach
them,
because
goggin
provides
this...
goggin
utilizes
this
elaborate
hypothetical,
or
elaborate
rather
arcane
structure
of
in
lieu
of
taxes
and
creates
these
bootstraps,
consecutive
bootstraps.
now,
one
can...
i
argued
to
the
ninth
circuit
that
those
consecutive
bootstraps
were
nonavailing
in
this
particular
circumstance,
but
they
have
held
that
those
are
the
logical
end
result
of
the
goggin
analysis
and
that
the
but
for
test,
if
one
will,
rising
from
one
tax
to
the
other,
to
the
other,
is
one
which
they
feel
compelled
to
indicate
in
these
cases.
mr.
robert
f.
tyler,
jr.
well,
on
the
first
line,
we
felt
that
we
should
have
won
in
the
ninth
circuit
under
the
debtor's
reorganizer's
rationale.
mr.
robert
f.
tyler,
jr.
but
there
was
no
reason
to
appeal
from
that
injunction.
simply
put--
mr.
robert
f.
tyler,
jr.
--no.
no,
that
injunction...
if
you
read
the
injunction,
the
injunction
said
you
may
not
take
from
the
debtor,
from
the
trustee
or
a
person
who
is
liable
to
reimburse
them,
for
a
sales
tax--
mr.
robert
f.
tyler,
jr.
--but
the
other
parties...
in
turn
it
has
to
be
limited
by
the
pleadings
underlying
the
judgment
itself
and
that
is
all
that
the
trustee
asked
for.
if
one
reads
the
conclusions
of
law
and
the
findings
of
fact
entered
by
the
court
at
that
time,
that
is
the
conclusion
that
the
court
came
to.
it
was
seeking
to
reach
only
the
tax
obligations
of
the
debtor
and
the
trustee
and
that
is
totally
consistent
with
bankruptcy
section
505,
because
that
is...
those
are
the
only
tax
obligations
raised
under
505
and
the
only
tax
obligations
that
are
litigable
under
section
505.
and
the
court
obviously
meant
to
adjudicate
that
which
was
brought
before
it
and
nothing
else.
mr.
robert
f.
tyler,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
f.
tyler,
jr.
no.
mr.
robert
f.
tyler,
jr.
why...
why...
why...
and,
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
mean
to
argue
with
you.
but
why
does
an
adjudication
of
rights
between
two
parties...
how
does
that
affect...
or,
why
should
a
party
have
to
adjudicate
with
a
disinterested
party,
essentially,
the
rights
of
subsequent
persons,
persons
who
subsequently
come
in
possession
of
that
property
for
subsequent
retail
transactions?
there
is
simply
no
rational
purpose
and
no
rational
reason
why
those
parties
should
litigate
that
question
at
that
time,
and
that's
why
res
judicata
should
not
be
applied
in
this
case.
and
simply
put,
none
of
the
parties
to
that
prior
proceeding
foresaw
the
application
of
this
particular
rule
to
these
transactions
on
behalf
of
respondent
herein.
mr.
robert
f.
tyler,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
f.
tyler,
jr.
that
is
correct.
we've
always
felt
that
goggin...
i
mean,
we
have...
this
court
knows
we
have
attempted
to
bring
the
goggin
issue
before
this
court
by
certiorari
in
numerous
instances.
mr.
robert
f.
tyler,
jr.
no,
this
court
can
also
state
that
the
previous
injunction
was
improperly
entered.
i
have
the
ability
to
be
here
because
of
the
fact
that
i
can
collaterally
attack
that
order
by
reason
of
the
jurisdictional
differences
and
the
fact
that
res
judicata
will
not
apply
to
our
case.
i
think
that
the
court
brought
up...
and
i
deign
to
say
why
the
court
brought
the
issue
up
before
it
at
this
time...
but
the
reason
and
the
patent
conflict
between
the
circuits
is
there.
the
question
is
one
of
law
and
there
are
no
facts
to
be
adjudicated
further
than
what's
in
the
record
before
you
now.
you
will
never
have
a
record
that
says
anything
different
from
this
record,
because
the
only
things
in
issue
are
the
legal
rights,
obligations
and
constructions
of
section
960
intergovernmental
tax
immunity
and
the
ability
of
the
states
to
exercise
such
a
tax,
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
