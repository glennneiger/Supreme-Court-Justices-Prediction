justice
kennedy
could
you
have
stipulated
to
an
injunction
which
would
forbid
you
from
collecting
tax
from
an
ultimate
user?
justice
kennedy
well,
suppose...
suppose
the
judge
said
i'm
going
to
enter
an
injunction
and
you
can't
tax
this
transaction,
and
you
can't
tax
ultimate
use
based
on
the
exempt
nature
of
this
transaction.
could
you
say,
we
stipulate
to
that,
your
honor?
justice
kennedy
all
right.
well,
hasn't
that
in
effect
happened,
because
the
judge...
at
least
arguably...
issued
a
very
broad
injunction
and
you
didn't
appeal
it.
if...
if
you
can
stipulate
to
it,
you
can't
come
up
here
and
say
well,
it's
beyond
their
jurisdiction.
justice
kennedy
well,
that's
the
second
question.
let's
assume
that
the
injunction
can
be
prohibited...
can
be
interpreted
to
prohibit
the
tax
in
this
transaction.
let's
assume
that
for
the
moment.
if
that's
the
case
and
you
didn't
appeal
the
injunction,
aren't
you
barred
by
res
judicata?
justice
kennedy
all
right.
and
if
not...
if
not,
then
we
don't
have
the
issue
before
us
anyway,
because
the
injunction
doesn't
even
apply.
so
i
don't
see
how
in
either
case
we
reach
the
constitutional
issue.
either
you're
bound
by
the
injunction
and
the
injunction
covers
you,
or
the
injunction
doesn't
cover
you,
but
in
either
event
i
don't
see
how
we
ever
reached
the
goggin
case.
justice
kennedy
well,
if
that's
true
then
that's
the
end
of
the
case
and
we
never
reach
the
goggin
principle.
justice
kennedy
did...
did
that
injunction
bar
you
from
collecting
a
use
tax
on
the
purchaser
at
the
time
of
the
sale?
justice
kennedy
no.
it
says
you
may
not
enforce
a
sales
or
other
tax
against
the
receiver
or
its
principals
or
other
parties
by
reason
of
the
sale.
