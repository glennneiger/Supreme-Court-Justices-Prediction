justice
scalia
i
don't
understand
that
answer.
your
answer
is
that
the
judgment
could
not
possibly
go
beyond
the
jurisdiction
permitted?
surely,
it
could.
justice
scalia
you
mean
no
court
has
ever
issued
a
judgment
which
went
beyond
what
the
court
could
do,
legally?
justice
scalia
well,
nobody
ever
means
to
do
that,
but
the
question
is
whether
it
did
so.
whether
the
text
of
the
judgment
was
clear
enough
that
it
meant
to
cover
even
subsequent...
subsequent
taxation
such
as
was
involved
here.
isn't
that
simply
a
question
of
construing
the
judgment?
justice
scalia
well,
we
ought
to
get
out
of
the
business
of
interpreting
statutes,
then.
just
let
congress
interpret
them.
i
thought...
you
know,
once
you
utter
a
judgment,
it
exists
out
there
and
it's
not
up
to
you
to
say
in
the
future
what
it
is.
it's
up
to
the
appellate
courts
to
say.
justice
scalia
well,
you
litigated
that
and
lost
it
and
didn't
appeal,
though
didn't
you?
justice
scalia
so
it's
too
late.
justice
scalia
no,
you
want
to
raise
it
again?
