mr.
david
ray
jenkins
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i
agree
with
ms.
justice
o'connor.
i
don't
think
you
can
reach
the
substantive
goggin
issues
in
this
case,
and
i
don't
think
you
can
allow
a
collateral
attack
of
this
judgment
without
doing
great
violence
to
your
own
precedent.
mr.
david
ray
jenkins
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
discussed
the
merits.
mr.
david
ray
jenkins
basically,
what
was
admitted
before
the
court
of
appeal
was
that
the
injunction
was
intended
to
enjoin
whatever
goggin
ii
proscribed
and
that's
why
they
discussed
the
merits
of
what
goggin
ii
proscribes
compared
to
what
was
going
on
in
this
case.
let's
look
at
the
record
very
briefly,
because
some,
in
my
view,
misrepresentations
have
been
made
to
you
about
the
status
of
the
record.
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
3
is
the
prayer
of
the
complaint
by
which
this
injunction
was
sought.
paragraph
2
of
the
prayer
requests
a
judgment
determining
that
the
debtor,
the
plaintiff...
who
was
the
estate...
and
any
and
all
other
parties
which
may
have
any
obligation
in
connection
therewith,
have
no
liability
or
obligation
to
the
defendant.
if
you
then
look
at
the--
mr.
david
ray
jenkins
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
ray
jenkins
no,
your
honor.
this
tax
is
in
effect
a
tax
on
the
sale,
because--
mr.
david
ray
jenkins
--they
came
back
and
tried
to
collect
it
later.
mr.
david
ray
jenkins
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
tax
that
they're
trying
to
collect
is
only
due
because
no
sales
tax--
mr.
david
ray
jenkins
--no,
your
honor.
my
client
was
not
a
party
to
that
proceeding,
but
my
client
was
intended
to
be
a
beneficiary
of
the
injunction
even
at
the
time
the
complaint
was
filed.
mr.
david
ray
jenkins
i
would
agree
with
counsel
for
the
petitioner
that
as
an
ordinary
rule
of
construction,
if
you're
looking
at
an
order
or
a
judgment
that's
entered
by
a
court,
that
you
ought
to
give
some
deference
to
what
that
judge
thinks
it
means.
this
case
is
different
for
two
reasons,
in
my
opinion.
one
reason
is
that
i
think
this
judge
took
a
view
of
his
own
order
that
simply
isn't
supported
by
the
literal
language
of
the
order.
the
second
reason
is
that
if
you
look
at
the
findings
and
the
opinion
that
the
judge
issued
in
that
case,
the
order
was
clearly
intended
to
proscribe
whatever
goggin
ii
proscribed.
so
it
basically
incorporated
by
reference
a
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
case,
and
the
petitioner
has
admitted
that.
they
have
admitted
that
this
injunction
was
intended
to
cover
whatever
goggin
ii
covered
and
i
think
that
in
that
regard,
deference
should
be
given
to
the
court
which
authored
the
goggin
ii
case
and
that's
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
david
ray
jenkins
i
think
that
what
the
court
needs
to
determine
is
what
the
goggin
case
means.
i
think
that
the
goggin
case
defines
the
parameters
of
this
injunction,
and
i
don't
think
this
court
can
reverse
the
goggin
cases.
i
think
all
it
can
do
is
construe
what
they
mean
for
the
purpose
of
determining
what
the
injunction
meant.
mr.
david
ray
jenkins
i
would
think
not.
mr.
david
ray
jenkins
i
did
not
do
that.
in
any
event,
they
are
bound
by
the
doctrines
of
res
judicata
and
collateral
estoppel.
mr.
david
ray
jenkins
no,
your
honor.
but
they
cannot
collaterally
attack
this
injunction.
this
court
has
a
long
line
of
precedent
that
says
that
they
can't,
including
a
specific
precedent
that
says--
mr.
david
ray
jenkins
--your
honor,
i
did
raise
that
in
my
brief.
mr.
david
ray
jenkins
no,
your
honor,
i
did
not.
i
raised
it
in
my
brief
that
the
doctrine...
the
doctrines
of
collateral
estoppel
and
res
judicata
prevent
a
collateral
attack
on
an
injunction
in
contempt
proceedings
and
the
state
had
every
opportunity
in
this
case
for
a
complete
trial.
as
it
happens
in
this
case,
the
facts
were
all
not
subject
to
dispute
and
there
was
a
stipulated
statement
of
facts,
but
they
had
the
opportunity
to
present
each
and
every
fact
that
they
wanted
to
present
in
connection
with
their
case
and
they
had
the
opportunity
to
file
a
brief.
and
they
did
file
a
brief
in
connection
with
the
injunction,
in
which
they
had
the
opportunity
to
raise
all
of
the
arguments
that
they're
raising
here
and
further,
they
in
fact
raised
almost
all
of
those
arguments
in
their
brief
on
the
injunction
action.
mr.
david
ray
jenkins
that
was
not
my
impression
when
i
argued
before
them
and
it's
not
the
way
i
read
that
opinion.
mr.
david
ray
jenkins
because
they
specifically
say
that
they're
bound
by
goggin
i
and
goggin
ii.
mr.
david
ray
jenkins
again,
my
understanding
from
having
been
there
was
that
they
felt
that
goggin
ii
not
only
bound
them
but
absolutely
and
very
clearly
controlled
this
issue.
are
there
any
other
questions
about
this
particular
issue?
because
if
there
aren't.
i'll
get
into
the
substantive
issues.
mr.
david
ray
jenkins
i
must
be
reading
that
differently
from
you,
your
honor.
when
they
talk
about
what
this
circuit
was
aware
of,
i
believe
they're
talking
about
at
the
time
the
goggin
cases
were
decided.
and
when
they're
talking
about
it
not
within
their
heart
to
change
the
rule,
i
think
they're
telling
you
that
they
wouldn't
if
they
could.
mr.
david
ray
jenkins
in
another
part
of
the
decision,
the
court
also
makes
reference
to
the
fact
that
they
could
have
litigated
this
issue
on
an
appeal
from
the
injunction
and
that
it's
now
too
late.
i
think
in
that
particular
portion
of
the
opinion,
what
they're
doing
is
they're
dealing
with
the
petitioner's
argument
that
the
other
circuits
are
right
and
goggin
is
wrong.
mr.
david
ray
jenkins
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
have
never
taken
the
position,
as
far
as
i
can
recall,
that
28
u.s.c.
section
960
in
and
of
itself
directly
limits
states
from
imposing
this
tax.
our
position
is
that
it
impliedly
creates
such
a
limitation,
and
we
are
well
aware
that
as
a
rule
of
construction
this
court
disfavors
implied
preemption.
but
the
argument
that
we're
making
in
this
case
is
not
substantially
different
from
the
line
of
reasoning
that
this
court
used
in
the
first
agricultural
national
bank
case
in
construing
12
u.s.c.
section
548.
in
that
case,
looking
at
the
legislative
history,
the
court
determined
that
congress
must
have
intended
that
this
section
pro...
prescribe
those
areas
in
which
taxation
was
permitted
to
the
exclusion
of
taxation
in
other
areas,
and
the
court
so
held.
i
do
want
to
point
out,
swarts
v.
hammer
was
decided
30
years
before
section
960
was
enacted.
presumably
congress
was
aware
of
swarts
v.
hammer
at
the
time
it
enacted
960.
the
swarts
v.
hammer
case
doesn't
deal
with
taxes
of
this
type.
what
swarts
v.
hammer
says
is
that
there's
no
magic
that
occurs
to
property
of
the
estate
when
a
bankruptcy
is
filed
such,
that
that
property
changes
its
nature
so
that
the
property
shouldn't
any
longer
be
subject
to
property
taxation,
and
we
don't
deny
that
property
in
bankruptcy
estates
is
subject
to
ad
valorem
taxes.
we
have
no
issue
with
that.
section
960
when
it
was
enacted
was
enacted
at
a
time
when
intergovernmental
immunity
was
at
its
high
water
mark
and
basically
there
were
decisions
which
tended
to
limit
the
ability
of
state
governments
to
tax
almost
anything
having
to
do
with
the
federal
instrumentality.
and
the
courts
on
some
occasions
had
found
bankruptcy
estates,
or
federal
receivers,
to
be
instrumentalities
of
the
federal
government.
if
the
supreme
court...
i'm
sorry.
if
congress
hadn't
felt
that
taxation
was
generally
proscribed,
it
wouldn't
have
enacted
960
because
it's
superfluous
otherwise,
and
i
can
see
a
reasonable
and
logical
argument
that
960
is
over
50
years
old
and
it's
basically
now
a
historic
anomaly.
the
problem
with
that
argument
is
that
congress
undertook
an
exhaustive
review
of
bankruptcy
law
in
1978
and
at
that
time
it
reviewed,
among
other
things,
the
provisions
of
the
chapter
in
which
section
960
is
and
congress
in
fact
made
some
conforming
changes
to
section
959.
if
congress
had
felt
that
section
960
were
no
longer
necessary
or
that
it
required
some
change
to
conform
with
the
present
status
of
the
law,
congress
could
easily
have
made
those
changes.
mr.
david
ray
jenkins
no,
your
honor,
i
believe
it
was
separate
statute.
mr.
david
ray
jenkins
1934.
i
believe
it
was
specifically
designed
to
deal
with
a
discrete
problem
and
the
problem
that
was
presented...
bearing
in
mind
that
that
was
a
time
of
great
economic
hardship
in
the
country...
the
basic
problem
that
was
presented
was,
you
have
two
businesses,
substantially
identical
to
one
another,
one
of
which
happens
to
be
in
a
federal
receivership,
the
other
of
which
happens
not
to
be.
the
receivership
business
at
that
time
was
allowed
to
operate
at
a
great
advantage
over
the
one
who
wasn't
and
i
think
the
feeling
was
that
everybody
in
the
world
was
going
to
wind
up
in
receivership
if
we
didn't
solve
that
problem.
the
second
reason
we
think
that
the
tax
is
not
permitted
on
a
bankruptcy
estate
has
to
do
with
mcculloch
v.
maryland.
basically,
this
tax
is
an
assertion
by
the
state...
or
a
tax
on
the
liquidation
process
itself
is
an
assertion
by
the
state
of
control
in
some
form
over
the
liquidation
process,
and
the
liquidation
process
is
what
bankruptcy
is
all
about.
it's
the
absolute
essence
of
bankruptcy.
even
in
those
cases
where
liquidation
is
not
ordinarily
contemplated,
such
as
chapters
11,
12
and
13--
mr.
david
ray
jenkins
--because,
in
essence,
this
is
still
a
tax
on
the
liquidation
sale
itself.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
state
collects
the
tax
at
my
cash
register
out
of
my
customer's
pocket,
or
mugs
him
on
the
street,
they're
still
doing
the
same
thing.
mr.
david
ray
jenkins
the
sale
is
over,
but--
mr.
david
ray
jenkins
--yes,
your
honor
and
we...
if
they
impose
a
tax
generally
that
said,
if
you
rent
skis
you
have
to
pay
a
tax,
we'd
pay
it.
the
only
reason
we
owe
this
tax
is
because
no
sales
tax
was
paid,
so
it's
still
a
tax
on
the
liquidation
sale
itself
and
in
operation
the
way
this
tax
works,
it's
basically
designed
to
terrorize
you
into
paying
the
sales
tax.
because
if
you
don't
pay
the
sales
tax
you
pay
a
tax
measured
by
the
same
percentage
of
your
rental
income
and
as
a
general
proposition,
if
you
don't
think
you're
going
to
generate
at
least
as
much
rental
income
as
you
paid
for
the
property,
you
wouldn't
buy
it.
so
as
a
general
proposition
you
would
ordinarily
expect
to,
you
know,
wind
up
paying
a
higher
use
tax
than
the
sales
tax
would
have
been.
so
basically
what
this
is,
your
honor,
is
it's
an
effort
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
go
far
enough
down
the
stream
that
they
think
they
can
safely
do
it,
but
still
tax
a
transaction
that
is
a
federal
transaction
and
is
not
taxable.
it's
an
effort
on
their
part--
mr.
david
ray
jenkins
--i'm
aware
of
those
holdings
and
i
disagree
with
them.
it's
not
unusual
for
there
to
be
different
constructions
of
different
words
in
different
parts
of
the
code.
for
example,
the
term
willful,
as
used
in
the
internal
revenue
code
dealing
with
the
100
percent
penalty
for
failure
to
withhold
and
turn
over,
at
least
as
construed
in
the
ninth
circuit,
it
means
that
you
were
alive
at
the
time.
willful
in
the
context
of
the
bankruptcy
code
means
something
much
more
limited
than
that.
i
think
that
you
don't
have
to
apply
doing
business
from
the
irc
to
the
bankruptcy
context
and
i
think
in
the
bankruptcy
context
you
have
a
long
line
of
established
case
authority
dealing
with
what
is
doing
business
and
what
isn't;
and
you're
certainly
going
to
have
factual
questions,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
fact
that
a
court
is
going
to
have
to
determine
some
factual
issues
justifies
coming
up
with
a
rule
that
goes
too
far.
the
concept
that
i
would
like
to
discuss
with
you
for
why
this
tax
isn't
allowable
is
one
that
i
think
the
court...
and
now
i'm
talking
about
the
specific
tax
on
my
client...
is
a
concept
that
the
court
has
alluded
to
in
the
united
states
v.
new
mexico
case
and
also
in
the
red
cross
case
dealing
with
employment
taxes,
and
the
concept
is
this:
there
are
some
transactions
irrespective
of
who
the
incidence
of
the
tax
falls
on,
there
are
some
transactions
which
are
federal
transactions
and
the
states
are
not
entitled
to
exercise
control
or
authority
over
them,
and
they
can't
do
that
by
simply
choosing
to
place
the
incidence
of
the
tax
on
somebody
other
than
the
federal
entity
itself,
and
that's
exactly
what
you
have
here.
no
matter
how
far
downstream
you
go,
as
long
as
they're
still
collecting
a
tax
that's
only
due
because
no
sales
tax
was
paid,
it's
still
basically
a
tax
on
the
sale
itself
and
that
transaction
is
a
federal
transaction
conducted
by
a
federal
bankruptcy
estate,
conducted
with
the
requirement
that
it
be
approved
by
the
federal
bankruptcy
court
and
it's
subject
to
a
whole
system
of
federal
regulation.
the
states
have
no
business
asserting
control
over
that
transaction
and
to
allow
them
to
is
to
basically
concede
to
them
control
over
the
bankruptcy
process.
mr.
david
ray
jenkins
i
agree
with
that,
but
i
think
even
under
the
more
pragmatic
basis
that
the
court
now
uses,
that
this
transaction
should
not
be
taxable
and
it's
part
of
the
bankruptcy
process.
the
states
have
no
more
business
asserting
control
over
the
bankruptcy
liquidation
process
than
they
do
asserting
control
over
national
banks,
and
that's
exactly
what
they're
trying
to
do.
now,
i
do
want
to
discuss
with
you
the
case
of
washington
v.
the
united
states,
because
it
appears
to
be
contrary
to
me.
in
that
case,
there
was
a
sales
tax
system
where
ordinarily
in
a
contractor
setting
if
i'm
a
contractor
and
i'm
building
a
house
for
you
and
i
go
down
to
the
hardware
store,
the
incidence
of
the
sales
tax...
the
liability
for
the
sales
tax
in
the
state
of
washington
is
placed
on
you
as
the
owner
of
the
property
that
i'm
going
to
improve.
but
the
statute
provides
for
a
specific
exception
which
says,
if
the
owner
of
the
property
is
a
federal
entity
then
the
tax
falls
on
the
contractor
and
in
response
to
the
argument
that
that
was
just
an
evasion
of
intergovernmental
immunity,
this
court
said,
look,
the
transaction
is
taxable.
the
fact
that
by
an
accident
of
state
law
the
incidence
of
that
tax
would
ordinarily
fall
on
an
exempt
entity
does
not
prevent
the
state
from
shifting
the
incidence
of
the
tax
to
somebody
else.
but
the
key
in
that
case
is
that
the
transaction
was
itself
taxable,
and
the
transaction
was
me,
a
contractor,
not
a
federal
entity,
going
down
to
the
hardware
store,
which
is
also
not
a
federal
entity
and
buying
stuff
to
use
to
improve
your
home.
that's
a
taxable
transaction.
the
difference
in
the
bankruptcy
case
is
that
it's
a
federal
transaction
governed
by
federal
law
and
the
state
has
no
right
to
attempt
to
control
it.
you
also
need
to
look
at
the
impact
that
your
ruling
is
going
to
have
on
the
bankruptcy
code
as
a
whole.
for
example,
if
you
hold
that
states
can
tax
the
liquidation
process
because
what
happens
in
the
reorganization
chapters
is
measured
by
what
would
happen
in
a
liquidation,
if
i
were
to
have
to
pay
a
6.5
percent
sales
tax
if
i
liquidated,
that's
6.5
percent
of
the
estate
that
i
get
to
pocket
as
the
debtor,
because
it's
something
that
wouldn't
have
to
go
to
the
creditors
and
in
chapter
11,
the
floor
on
what
you
have
to
pay
the
creditors
is
what
they
would
get
in
a
reorganization
and
there
are
similar
provisions
in
both
chapters
12
and
13.
that...
the
net
result
of
that
would
be
that
if
you
find
that
states
can
tax
bankruptcy
liquidation
sales
you're
going
to
be
allowing
debtors
to
achieve
a
great
windfall
and
i
don't
think
that
congress
had
that
in
mind
at
all.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i
will
remit
the
rest
of
my
time.
