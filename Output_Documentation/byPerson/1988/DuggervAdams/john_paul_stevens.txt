john
paul
stevens
ms.
roper,
do
you
think
it's
clear
at
the
time
of
trial
that
if
the
objection
had
been
made,
the
trial
should...
the
trial
court
should
have
sustained
the
objection?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
this
is
a
case
of
clear
error
by
the
trial
judge,
in
other
words,
in
your
view.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
it
would
have
been
a
futile
objection
that
mould
have
been
made
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
you're,
saying
the
building
blocks
were
there.
were
there...
were
there
enough
building
blocks
to
advise
the
trial
judge
as
to
how
to
rule
on
such
an
objection?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
what
should
the
trial
judge
have
done
if
an
objection
had
been
made
in
1978?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
we
know
what
the
facts
are,
but
what
is
your
view?
at
that...
at
that
time
would
you
say
the
trial
judge
should
have
sustained
the
objection?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
then
your
position
on
procedural
default
really
depends
on
the
merits
of
the
caldwell
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
bottom
line
you
don't
think
there's
a
valid
caldwell
claim
here
anyway.
so,
we
really
don't
have
to
go
through
all
this
procedural--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
tabak,
do
you
cite
the
copeland
case
in
your
brief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
have
the
citation?
