justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
any
capital...
capital
punishment
decision
from
this
court
involving
the
eighth
amendment
that
it
shouldn't
be
applied
retroactively
under
that
standard?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
take
it
your
position
is
going
to
be
that's
a
violation
of
state
law
or
it
misstates
the
state
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
is
it
that
the
defendant
should
not
be
held
to
have
objected?
what
difference
does
it
make
that
the
violation
depends
on
state
law
or
that
it's
an
eighth
amendment
violation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
why
should
that
be
that
because
the...
the
purposes
of...
of
the
two
rules
are...
are
the
same?
i...
i
assume
if
the
state
rule
is
as
you
say
it
is,
it
is
so
that
the
jury
is
aware
of
its
responsibility
and
of
its
role
in
the
process.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it's
exactly
the
eighth
amendment
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
defendant
did
not
object.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--we'll
get
that...
to
that
in
a
minute.
but
on
the
premise
that
this
was
a...
a
misstatement,
an
egregious
misstatement
i
think
you'll
probably
tell
us,
of
florida
law,
why
is
it,
as
a
matter
of
policy,
that
we
should
suddenly
allow
an
eighth
amendment
claim
when
the
state
law
violation,
the
state
law
error,
was
not
objected
to
and
serves
exactly
the
same
purposes?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
counsel,
it
seems
to
me
the
question
is
whether
as
a
practical
matter,
as
a
pragmatic
matter,
as
a
realistic
matter,
this
instruction
actually
misled
the
jury.
and
i
see
nothing
to
indicate
that
counsel
shouldn't
have
made
that
objection
under
state
law.
and
you
simply
speculate
that
the
trial
judge
would
have
overruled
the
objection,
but
that's
sheer
speculation.
and
that's
the
whole
purpose
for
the
rule
that
requires
us
to
make
objections
in
a
timely
fashion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
think
caldwell
would
have
anything
to
do
with
the
case
then?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
just...
i
want
to
know.
suppose
that
repeatedly
the
florida
supreme
court
had
approved
instructions
like
this.
the...
the
instruction
was
a
correct
statement
of
florida
law.
let's
just
assume
that
it
was.
would
caldwell
have
anything
to
do
with
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then...
then
as
it
has
been
pressed
before,
you
do...
there
is
a...
if...
for
caldwell
to
be
applicable,
this
instruction
had
to
misstate
state
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
there
was
no
objection
to
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
would
it
have
taken
any
magician
to...
to...
to
recognize
that
this
was
a
misstatement
of
florida
law?
