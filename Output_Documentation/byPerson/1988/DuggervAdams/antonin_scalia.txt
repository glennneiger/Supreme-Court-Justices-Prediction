justice
antonin
scalia
--ms.
roper,
isn't...
isn't
it
true
that
the
florida
supreme
court
has...
has
reversed
a
trial
judge
who
doesn't
accept
the
jury's
recommendation?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
does
so
with
some
regularity.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
it's...
it's
not
just
a
recommendation
then.
i
meant
that
must
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
must
mean
that
it's
not
just
a
recommendation,
musn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
about...
what
about
ferry
v.
state?
the
statement
of
the
florida
supreme
court
is
quoted
in...
in
respondent's
brief
where
the
florida
supreme
court
in
reversing
the
trial
judge's
sentence
which
ignored
the
recommendation
said
under
the
state's
theory,
there
would
be
little
or
no
need
for
a
jury's
advisory
recommendation.
this
is
not
the
law.
sub
judice,
the
jury's
recommendation
of
life
was
reasonably
based
on
valid
mitigating
factors.
the
fact
that
reasonable
could
differ
renders
the
override
improper.
that
sounds
to
me
like
more
than
a
recommendation.
it
sounds
to
me
he
has
to
accept
it
if
a
reasonable
person
could...
could
make
that
recommendation.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms....
ms.
roper,
i
hate
to
come
back
to
it,
but
i...
i...
i've
been
thinking
about
it
some
more
and
i
still
don't
know
what
you
say
the...
what
is
the
florida
supreme
court's...
what
was
the
florida
supreme
court
saying
in
ferry
when
it
said
the
fact
that
reasonable
people
could
differ
renders
the
override
of
the
jury's
recommendation
improper?
what...
and
that's
a
recent
case.
that's
an
1987
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
really
doesn't...
it
really
doesn't
supply
an
independent
basis
as
you've
said.
doesn't
the
eighth
amendment
claim
require
you
to
establish
that
state
law
was
improperly
described
to
the
jury?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
what
you
have
is...
is...
is
a
federal
claim
that
has
within
it
the
state...
the
state
claim
that
could
have
been
objected
to.
to
be
sure,
it
was
not
a
claim
under
the
eighth
amendment,
but...
but
surely
the
jury
must
be
instructed
properly
concerning
state
law.
surely
that
could
have
been
objected
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
true.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
still
amounts
to
it
was
not
objected
to
at
that
time
and
could
have
gotten
corrected
at
that
time.
he
could
have...
his
counsel
could
have
jumped
up
and
said
that
is
not
the
state
law.
the
jury
should
be
instructed
correctly,
and
had
he
said
that,
the
trial
judge
would
have
done
it.
he
didn't
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
wait
a
minute.
based
on
its
recent
jurisprudence,
would
have
said
that
the
instruction
was
correct?
i
thought
you
say--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
that's
okay.
