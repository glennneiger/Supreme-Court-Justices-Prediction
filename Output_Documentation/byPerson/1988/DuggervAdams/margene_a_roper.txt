ms.
margene
a.
roper
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
aubrey
dennis
adams,
jr.
was
convicted
of
the
first
degree
strangulation
murder
of
an
eight-year
old
child
in
1978.
eight
years
later,
the
eleventh
circuit
court
of
appeals,
applying
the
principles
enunciated
by
this
court
in
caldwell
v.
mississippi,
vacated
adams'
sentence
of
death.
we
are
before
the
court
today
asking
it
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
eleventh
circuit
court
of
appeals.
our
position
in
the
case
and
at
issue
in
the
case
is
our
contention
that
the
merits
of
the
alleged
caldwell
claim
should
never
have
been
reached
because
of
the
abuse
of
the
writ
doctrine
and
because
adams
had
procedurally
defaulted
upon
this
claim
in
state
court.
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
the
issue
of
abuse
of
the
writ
is
before
the
court
and
is
fairly
comprised
within
the
question
presented
to
the
court.
ms.
margene
a.
roper
the
thrust
of
the
entire
cert
petition,
your
honor,
i
would
submit
is
that
there
was
no
significant
change
of
law
to
excuse
the
application
of
all
procedural
barriers,
and
by
that
we
meant
not
only
the
doctrine
of
procedural
default,
but
abuse
of
the
writ
as
well.
and
we
would
submit
that
the
issue
is
fairly
subsumed
because
any
analysis
this
court
takes
in
regard
to
a
change
in
law
would
have
necessary
applicability
to
the
doctrine
of
abuse
of
the
writ.
ms.
margene
a.
roper
it
was
raised
on
the
basis,
i
would
submit,
of
a
misapplication
of
the
court
below
of
the
principles
enunciated
in
reed
v.
ross
which
does
deal
with
a
change
in
law
which
is
significant
enough
to
constitute
cause
for
procedural
default.
and
necessarily
any
such
change
in
law
analysis
would
have
application
as
well
under
the
abuse
of
the
writ
doctrine
as
the
advisory
committee
note
indicates
that
a
change
in
the
law
can
excuse
a
failure
to
submit
an
issue
in
a
first
habeas
petition
as
well.
so,
i
think
it
could
be
argued
in
subsequent
cases
that
this
court's
rationale
in
this
very
case
in
both
contexts.
so,
i
think
it
is
subsumed.
also,
i
think
that
the
court
does
have
jurisdiction
in
this
case
to
notice
plain
error.
and
if
the
court
does
find
error
in
regard
to
there
not
being
a
change
in
law
to
excuse
procedural
default,
i
think
it
would
apply
as
well
across
the
board
to
the
issue
of
abuse
of
the
writ
so
that
plain
error
could
be
noticed
there.
the
procedural
history
of
the
case
reflects
that
adams
did
not
object
to
the
trial
judge's
statements
at
the
time
of
the
actual
trial
in
1978
or
on
direct
appeal
in
1979.
the
governor
signed
his
first
death
warrant
on
adams
in
1984,
and
at
that
point
in
time
adams
did
not
raise
the
instant
claim
in
his
state
court
attack
collaterally
on
his
judgment
and
sentence
and
he
did
not
raise
it
in
his
first
habeas
petition.
the
issue
was
first
raised
for
the
first
time
in
1986
upon
the
signing
of
a
second
death
warrant,
and
it
was
at
that
time
presented
to
state
and
federal
courts
for
the
first
time.
according
to
the
principles
enunciated
in
reed
v.
ross,
i
think
it's
clear
that
where
the
constitutional
basis
of
a
claim
is
not
available
to
an
attorney,
then
there
is
cause
for
his
failure
to
not
raise
the
claim
in
accordance
with
state
procedural
rules.
and
there
is
a
concomitant
advisory
committee
note
in
the
area
of
habeas
corpus
litigation
to
rule
9(b)
which
indicates
that
a
change
in
law
will
also
excuse
the
failure
to
present
an
issue
in
the
first
habeas
petition.
we...
we
would
submit
to
the
court,
however,
that
where
there
are
tools
available
to
construct
a
claim,
that
a
court
should
not
find
that
there
is
cause
for
a
procedural
default.
our
position
is
that
at
the
time
of
trial
and
on
direct
appeal
there
were
necessary
building
blocks
by
which
aubrey
dennis
adams,
jr.
could
have
fashioned
and
presented
this
claim
to
the
state
courts.
and
those
building
blocks
grew
as
time
progressed
until
there
was
quite
a
monumental
stack
of
them
at
the
time
of
adams'
first
habeas
petition
in
1984.
we
have
chronicled
the
progression
of
the
law
in
this
area,
and
i
don't
want
to
dwell
in
length
at
it.
but
i
think
a
few
comments
are
in
order.
i
would
first
note
that
if
the
comments
are
misleading,
adams
needn't
have
awaited
this
court's
decision
in
caldwell
to
set
a
principle
that
misleading
comments
should
be
objected
to
or
are
erroneous.
if
it
was
misleading,
then
at
that
point
in
time,
adams
had
a
basis
to
frame
an
objection
at
trial.
moreover,
if
it
can
be
argued
or
held
that
the
comments
were
misleading
on
the
basis
of
the
florida
supreme
court's
decision
in
tedder
v.
state,
which
indicates
that
a
jury's
recommendations
should
be
given
great
weight
by
the
trial
judge,
then
at
the
time
of
trial
adams
again
had
a
basis
to
raise
this
objection
because
the
tedder
decision
was
in
existence
at
that
time.
i
think
it's
clear
that
at
the
time
of
trial
any
competent
litigator
would
have
objected
to
statements
which
indicated
that
the
jury
needn't
be
considered...
needn't
consider
or
ruminate
over
the
consequences
of
their
verdict.
i
think
that
proposition
would
be
clear
to
any
attorney.
ms.
margene
a.
roper
under
florida
case
law,
that
would
be
clear
at
the
time
of
trial,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
margene
a.
roper
i
don't
believe
that
it's
a
case
of
error
at
all
on
the
part
of
the
trial
judge.
i'm
saying
that
if
error
could
arguably
be
found,
then
there
was
a
basis
for
bringing
that
error
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
my
contention
is
that
there
was
no
error
in
the
trial
judge's
statements
in
the
first
instance.
ms.
margene
a.
roper
well,
i
don't
think--
ms.
margene
a.
roper
--yes.
ms.
margene
a.
roper
i
think
the
trial
judge
would
have
declared
a
mistrial
as
far
as
sentencing
goes
and
had
a
resentencing
if
error
was
established,
but
our
position
is--
ms.
margene
a.
roper
--not
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
no,
but
the
basis
for
the
objection
was
there
and
that's
our
position.
ms.
margene
a.
roper
yes,
that's
exactly,
your
honor...
that's
exactly
what
i'm
saying.
ms.
margene
a.
roper
there
is
a
interplay
of
concepts
in
this
case,
and
i--
ms.
margene
a.
roper
--that's
correct.
and
i'm
not
going
to
dwell
at
length
on
it.
this
court
has
noted
the
strong
state
law
basis
for
it,
and
from
a
defendant's
perspective,
it
doesn't
matter
to
him
whether
his
reversal
is
gained
in
a
state
or
a
federal
court
on
state
law
grounds
or
federal
grounds.
so,
i
think
that
the
fact
that
if
there
was
a
state
law
basis
provides
a
basis
for
raising
the
claim
in
any
context
and
there's
no
less
potential
for
sandbagging
by
falling
to
raise
a
state
law
ground.
you
can
still
hold
that
in
abeyance,
and
the
real
issue
is
still
delay
just
as
in
the
case
where
a
federal
ground
was
not
submitted
to
a
state
court.
so,
i
think
that
the
state
law
basis
is
also
a
compelling
consideration.
but,
more
importantly,
i
think
there
was
an
eighth
amendment
basis,
a
clear
eighth
amendment
basis,
for
this
claim
at
the
time
of
trial
and
even
progressively
more
so
at
the
time
of
his
habeas
petition.
at
the
time
of
the
habeas
petition,
in
fact,
justice
stevens
had
indicated
in
a
concurring
opinion
in
maggio
the
danger
of
a
prosecutor
advising
a
jury
that
an
appellate
court
could
correct
any
error.
and
at
that
point
in
time
the
decision
in
california
v.
ramos
was
out
and
all
the
other
prior
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence
of
this
court.
and
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
brief,
caldwell
himself
was
able
to
raise
this
claim
based
upon
ramos
and
other
prior
cases
of
this
court.
another
issue
in
the
case
is
whether
the
florida
supreme
court
in
regard
to
the
procedural
default
actually
found
a
third
layer
of
default.
i...
i
think
an
examination
of
their
opinion
reflects
that
no
other
construction
can
be
given
to
it.
the
language
in
the
opinion
indicated
that
further,
we
find
the
presentation
of
these
claims
an
abuse
of
the
post-conviction
procedure.
rule
3.850
was
then
set
out
and
it
was
described
as
barring
new
claims
as
well
as
successive
claims.
and
the
florida
supreme
court
then
concluded
and
held
that
the
new
claims
were
barred
as
an
abuse
of
procedure
as
well
as
by
case
law.
and
the
new
rule
3.850
is
a...
a
codification
of
prior
existing
case
law
barring
such
new
claims.
and
i
would
also
submit
to
the
court
that
contrary
to
the
respondent's
position,
florida
has
regularly
and
consistently
applied
its
procedural
bars
in
the
context
of
caldwell
claims
being
raised
on
collateral
attack.
the
court
has
discussed
in
its
opinions
the
inapplicability
of
caldwell
only
to
demonstrate
that
no
relief
can
be
granted
in
this
area
on
a
3.850,
and
it
cannot
be
entertained
because
caldwell
is
not
a
significant
change
of
law,
which
is
one
of
the
criteria
under
our
post-conviction
relief
procedure.
caldwell
was
discussed
in
the
case
of
garcia...
excuse
me...
only
to
demonstrate
the
absence
of
error.
in
that
case
it
was
contended
by
the
defendant
that
the
trial
judge
gave
too
much
weight
to
the
jury's
advisory
sentence.
so,
in
conclusion,
the
florida
supreme
court
has
regularly
and
consistently
applied
its
procedural
bar.
our
contention
is
that
even
if
the
merits
of
the
claim
could
be
reached,
adams
is
still
entitled
to
no
relief
because
the
claim
is
an
adequate
description
of
florida
sentencing
procedure.
during
voir
dire
in
this
case,
each
time
new
prospective
jurors
were
seated,
the
trial
judge
explained
our
capital
sentencing
system
to
them.
he
advised
them
of
the
advisory
nature
of
their
sentencing
recommendation
and
the
fact
that
he
could
disregard
it
and
sentence
them
to
either
life
or
death.
in
elaborating
upon
this,
he
indicated
verbally
to
the
jurors,
distilled
to
its
essence,
the
ultimate
decision
is
on
my
conscience
and
rests
upon
my
shoulders,
not
the
jury's.
during
voir
dire,
however,
he
also
instructed
the
jury
as
to
the
finding
and
the
weighing
of
aggravating
circumstances.
proceeding
to
the
penalty
phase,
the
jury
was
similarly
again
instructed
under
our
standard
instruction...
excuse
me
that
their
recommendation
is
advisory
in
the
final...
the
sole
responsibility
for
the
final
determination
rests
upon
the
trial
judge.
at
that
point
in
time,
however,
they
were
also
instructed
that
they
must
find
sufficient
aggravating
circumstances
not
outweighed
by
the
mitigating
circumstances
and
that
their
verdict
should
be
based
on
the
evidence.
more
than
that
and
most
important
to
this
case
also
is
the
fact
that
the
trial
judge
drove
home
to
them
the
importance
and
the
gravity
of
their
undertaking
at
that
particular
time
in
the
proceeding.
he
stated
to
them
that
they
should
not
act
hastily
or
without
due
regard
to
the
gravity
of
these
proceedings,
and
he
instructed
them
to
carefully
weigh,
sift
and
consider
the
evidence,
and
all
of
it,
realizing
that
human
life
is
at
stake.
i
don't
think
the
jury
could
have
any
notion
at
all
but
their...
their
recommendation
may
have
the
possibility
of
sealing
adams'
fate.
i
think
that
that
was
driven
home
to
them.
moreover,
the
prosecutor
admonished
the
jurors
to
be
fair
to
the
defendant
and
the
people
of
the
state
of
florida,
and
that
any
way
they
decide
will
satisfy
the
people
of
the
state
of
florida.
these
statements
were
an
accurate
description
of
florida
law.
under
our
death
penalty
statute,
florida
statutes
921.141,
a
jury
is
directed
to
return
an
advisory
recommendation,
but
the
statute
proceeds
to
state
beyond
that
notwithstanding
the
recommendation,
the
court,
after
weighing
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances,
shall
enter
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
or
death.
under
our
statute
then,
the
judge
is
the
sentencer
and
not
the
jury.
what
the
judge
looks
for
from
the
jury
is
essentially
in
the
nature
of
guidance
alone.
and
i
think
that
his
independent
nature
as
the
sentencer
is
reflected
most
aptly
in
a
scenario
where
if
the
jury
recommends
death
and
the
trial
judge,
applying
the
statutory
criteria,
cannot
find
an
aggravating
circumstance,
he's
constrained
to
impose
a
sentence
of
lite.
i
think
that
reflects
that
he
is,
indeed,
an
independent
and
ultimate
sentencer.
excuse
me.
i
would
further
submit
to
the
court
that
these
statements
are
not
made
inaccurate
by
the
florida
supreme
court
decision
in
tedder
v.
state.
the
florida
supreme
court
has
recently
indicated
in
the
case
of
combs
v.
state
that
in
so
holding
in
tedder,
it
never
meant
to
alter
the
clear
statutory
directive
that
the
jury's
recommendation
is
advisory
only.
and
they
had,
in
fact,
promulgated
the
standard
jury
instructions
in
question
in
this
case
after
the
tedder
decision.
sos
at
best
tedder
is
either
an
appellate
standard
or
simply
an
admonition
to
trial
judges
to
carefully
consider
the
jury's
recommendation
prior
to
their
own
independent
findings.
i
think
the
case
would
fall
squarely
within
the
ambit
of
california
v.
ramos
which
does
not
prohibit
the
jury
from
being
given
accurate
instructions
rather
than
within
the
ambit
of
caldwell
v.
mississippi.
and
think
the
distinguishing
factor
is
that
in
caldwell
v.
mississippi,
this
court
found
the
instructions
to
be
misleading.
there
is
no
danger
of
that
in
this
case.
i
think
the
state
of
florida
has
a
valid
penalogical
interest
in
having
such
information
imparted
to
the
jury
because
the
state
does
not
want
its
citizens'
faith
and
the
integrity
of
judicial
and
criminal
proceedings
destroyed
by
having
them
later
find
out,
after
they
had
served
on
a
jury,
that
indeed
they
weren't
true
sentencers
at
all,
they
were
simply
advisors.
and
i
think
that
that
would
go
a
long
way
toward
the
people
of
our
state
losing
faith
in
the
criminal
justice
system.
and
it
has
to
be
remembered
also
that
the
community
voice
that
participates
in
the
trial
is
also
the
community
voice
that's
heard
in
the
legislature
as
well
when
the
legislature
enacts
and
implements
a
death
penalty
statute.
so,
we
can't
assume
that
the
jury
is
ignorant
of
our
statutory
scheme
in
the
first
instance,
and
i
don't
think
that
we
should
be
required
to
mislead
them
in
any
way
as
to
their
role
in
sentencing
when
they
are,
in
fact,
not
sentencers.
i
think
another
valid
state
penalogical
interest
in
having
the
jury
learn
or
understand
their
role
in
our
sentencing
procedure
is
that
it
actually
enhances
the
reliability
of
their
deliberations
because
they
understand
their
true
role.
and
not
only
that,
but
i
think
the
questioning
and
such
knowledge,
even
if
it's
imparted
to
them
at
the
penalty
phase,
but
most
particularly
during
voir
dire,
would
go
toward
including
within
a
jury
those...
those
jurors
who
may
be
death-scrupled
to
the
degree
that
they
could
not
impose
a
sentence
of
death
if
theirs
was
the
final
verdict.
if
they
realized
that
their
sentence...
or
advisory
sentence
was
simply
a
recommendation,
then
they
could
impose
a
sentence
of
death
and
would
be
included
on
the
jury.
that's
another
valid
state
interest
and
an
interest
that
really
accrues
to
the
benefit
of
the
defendant
is
the
goal
of
achieving
a
cross
section
of
the
community
anti
having
life-prone,
as
well
as
jurors
who
are
more
retributive,
make
a
final
determination
as
to
a
defendant's
fate.
and
i
don't
think
such
an
instruction
would
cause
any
sort
of
bias
under
the
four-prong
bias
analysis
of
this
court
in
the
caldwell
decision.
there
is
no
danger
that
the
jury
might
not
understand
the
limited
nature
of
appellate
review
because,
in
fact,
the
judge
is
the
ultimate
sentencer.
the
jury
can't
send
a
message
of
disapproval
to
the
community
or
a
higher
authority
because
of
the
fact
that
the
jury
is
not
in
the
first
place
a
recognized
sentencer.
and
even
if
it
had
a
desire
to
send
such
a
message
of
disapproval,
that
message
can't
get
past
the
trial
judge
because
he
is
the
sentencer
and
he
makes
his
own
independent
determination.
the
judge
in
florida
can
overrule
a
life
sentencer
not
only
a
death
sentence.
so,
there
would
be
no
urge
on
the
part
of
the
jury
at
all
to
delegate
its
duty
by
returning
a
death
sentence
because
it
could
delegate
its
duty
by
returning
a
life
sentence
as
well
and
there
would,
further,
be
no
reasons
for
a
juror
who
was
reluctant
to
vote
tar
death
in
a
deadlock
situation
to
capitulate
to
demands
because
of
this
same
fact.
i
think
the
real
issue
in
this
case...
and
it
has
been
made
clear
in
subsequent
eleventh
circuit
opinions...
is
the
contention
that
it
is
the
voir
dire
statements
alone
which
are
erroneous.
the
eleventh
circuit
in
harich
v.
wainwright
has
indicated
that
there
is
no
caldwell
claim
presented
at
all
in
regard
to
the
penalty
phase
instructions
that
the
jury
can
be
told
of
the
advisory
nature
of
its
sentencing
recommendations.
so,
that
would
not
implicate
our
sentencing...
or
penalty
phase
instructions.
and
other
cases
in
the
eleventh
circuit
have
indicated
that
the
error
they
perceive
in
this
case
is
the
trial
judge's
statements
at
voir
dire.
now,
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
if
it
is
correct,
which
the
lower
court
is
even
now
in
agreement
with,
state
and
federal,
that
the
judge
is
the
ultimate
sentencer,
then
as
a
matter
of
logic,
the
decision
is
on
his
conscience
and
it
is
on
his
shoulders,
and
that
even
these
voir
dire
statements
were
a
correct
statement
of
florida
law
as
a
matter
of
logic.
it's
our
further
position
that
it
these
statements
could
be
seen
to
fit
within
the
prohibition
enunciated
in
caldwell
by
this
court,
that
any
such
error
would
be
harmless.
and
for
the
same
reasons
such
error
would
be
harmless,
prejudice
was
not
demonstrated
by
adams
below
to
overcome
a
procedural
default.
in
the
first
place
in
this
case,
voir
dire
took
place
on
october
12
through
october
16.
the
penalty
phase
did
not
occur
until
october
27.
thus,
there
was
a...
a
lapse
between
voir
dire
and
sentencing
of
almost
11
days.
i
think
this
court
noted
in
its
recent
case
of
darden
v.
wainwright
in
a
footnote
that
the
fact
that
these
comments
occurred
during
the
guilt-innocent
stage
lessened
any
chance
at
all
that
they
had
an
effect
on
sentencing.
in
this
case--
ms.
margene
a.
roper
--yes.
ms.
margene
a.
roper
yes,
it
does.
ms.
margene
a.
roper
i--
ms.
margene
a.
roper
--i
don't
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
when
the
florida
supreme
court
reverses
a
jury
override,
it's
reversing
the
trial
judge.
the
court
will
find
that
aggravating
circumstances
have
been
improperly
found
and
that
there
are
obvious,
very
obvious,
mitigating
circumstances
that
should
have
been
found.
and
it
will
make
a
statutory
analysis.
and
i
submit
that
any
error
in
a
jury
override
situation
is
error
on
the
part
of
the
trial
judge.
ms.
margene
a.
roper
again,
that's
extraneous
appellate
language,
and
as
i
said
before,
if
tedder
represents
anything
at
all,
it's
either
an
admonition
to
trial
judges
or
an
appellate
standard.
it's
not
a
direction
to
trial
judges
in
the
least.
they're
compelled
under
our
statute
to
independently
find
whether
death
is
a
appropriate
sentence.
the
ferry
case
i
think
stands
out
because
ferry
walked
into
a
grocery
store.
he
threw
gasoline
on
numbers
of
people
and
set
them
on
fire.
i
think
mental
illness
has
always
been
considered
by
all
courts
to
be
an
extremely
strong
mitigating
factor.
and
the
florida
supreme
court
stated
in
ferry
that
he
was
extremely
mental
ill,
and
i...
mentally
ill,
and
i
think
that
that
was
the
overriding
consideration
in
that
case,
that
it
was
just
so
obvious,
although
they
may
chastise
the
judge,
it
should
have
been
obvious
to
him,
aside
from
what
the
jury
recommended,--
i
would
also
submit
to
the
court
that
the
error
in
this
case
is
harmless,
and
prejudice
hasn't
been
demonstrated
for
the
further
reason
that
the
subsequent
instructions
to
the
jury
drove
home
to
them
quite
clearly
the
gravity
of
their
undertaking,
particularly
the
later
statement
by
the
trial
judge
to
carefully
weigh,
sift
and
consider
the
evidence,
and
all
of
it,
considering
that
human
life
is
at
stake.
so,
i
think
that
aside
from
any
voir
dire
statements,
the
jury
certainly
had
driven
home
to
them
the
gravity
of
their
undertaking.
also,
adams
has
not
demonstrated
and
cannot
demonstrate
that
he's
innocent
of
any
aggravating
factor
in
this
case.
the
murder
under
florida
law
is
clearly
heinous,
atrocious
and
cruel.
it
was
committed
during
an
attempted
rape
by
adams'
own
confession
and
during
a
kidnapping
and
to
avoid
lawful
arrest,
as
his
confession
also
indicated,
that
the
child
was
screaming,
and
he
put
his
hand
over
her
mouth
to
silence
her.
the
lower
court
found
it
compelling
that
there
was
a
balance
of
aggravating
and
mitigating
factors,
but
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
that's
not
the
case
at
all.
this
jury
deliberated
for
only
one-half
hour
before
recommending
that
adams
be
sentenced
to
death.
i
think
the
heinousness
of
this
crime
just
leaps
out
from...
from
the
sentencing
order
aside
from
any
mere
numerical
balance.
and
i
would
submit
that
that's
all
it
is
is
a
numerical
balance.
ms.
margene
a.
roper
i
think
what
the
florida
supreme
court
is
saying
is...
again,
the
answer
i
have
for
it
is
that
it's
an
appellate
standard.
it's
the
same
sort
of
standard
that
was
set
forth
in
tedder.
i
think
you
have
to
consider
the
florida
supreme
court's
other
statements,
especially
in
combs,
that
they
didn't
mean
to
detract
from
the
clear
statutory
directive.
i
think
when
the
florida
supreme
court
finds
error,
it's
judicial
error.
and
i
don't
think
anything
bespeaks
of
this
more
than
the
actual
tedder
decision
itself.
in
tedder,
the
court
later
went
on
to
indicate
that
two
of
the
aggravating
factors
were
invalid
in
tedder
and
that
they
would
have
been
constrained
to
reverse
under
a
proportionality
analysis
in
any
event.
so,
i
think
the
florida
supreme
court
basically
determines
whether
it
is
the
trial
judge
who
has
erred
or
not
and
the
other
language
is
extraneous.
it's
a
appellate
standard
or
an
admonition
to
the
judges
to...
to
more
carefully
consider
the
guidance
offered
by
the
jury,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
jury's
recommendation,
as
this
court
recognized
in
spaziano,
rises
to
the
level
of
a
judgment
or
makes
the
jury
a
presumptive
sentencer.
xxx.
ms.
margene
a.
roper
i
would
just
like
to
briefly
respond.
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
consideration
of
cases
raising
claims
other
than
caldwell
claims
in
the
context
of
determining
whether
there's
independent
and
adequate
state
ground
is
of
no
moment
to
this
court.
engle
v.
isaac
indicated
that
federal
courts
should
honor
state
procedural
rules
as
well
as
rulings.
and
i
think
florida's
post-conviction
rule,
florida
rule
of
criminal
procedure
3.850,
has
to
be
honored.
in
the
same
context,
i
think
the
florida
supreme
court,
like
a
federal
court,
has
the
right
to
develop
its
own
evolving
notions
of
what
constitutes
fundamental
error
and
what
they
can
and
cannot
entertain
on
collateral
review.
in
regard
to
these
cases,
however,
particularly
the
hitchcock
cases,
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
florida
supreme
court
did
regularly
and
consistently
bar
hitchcock
claims
until
it
perceived
that
a
change
of
law
was
imposed
upon
it
by
this
court.
in
the
actual
copeland
case,
copeland
was
taken
before
this
court
and
this
court
reversed
and
stated
that
florida
should
look
at
copeland
again
for
a
hitchcock
violation.
in
regard
to
a
basis
for
raising
the
claim
counsel
just
most
recently
discussed,
i
think
that
california
v.
ramos
stands
out
first
and
foremost
at
the
time
of
his
filing
his
first
habeas
petition
as
authority
for
raising
this
claim
and
even
discussed
hypothetically
a
eighth
amendment
situation
whereby
the
jury
could
be
instructed
that
the
governor
had
the
power
to
commute
a
death
sentence.
and
i
don't
think
there's
a
requirement
that
a
claim
have
to
be...
a
claim
has
to
be
meritorious
or
there
has
to
be
an
assured
victory
in
order
to
raise
it.
that
doesn't
comport
with
the
idea
that
a
basis
for
a
claim
is
there.
and
caldwell
had
the
basis
himself
on...
to
raise
this
claim
and
brought
it
before
the
court
on
the
basis
of
ramos
and
other
existing
eighth
amendment
cases.
thank
you.
