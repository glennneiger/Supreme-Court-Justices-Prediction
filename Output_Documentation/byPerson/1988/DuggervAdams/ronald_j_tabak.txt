mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
that
one
preliminary
matter
that
has
really
been
overlooked
in
the
state's
argument
is
when
they
talk
about
a
procedural
bar
here,
is
there
simply
was
no
independent
or
adequate
state
ground
in
this
case.
as
unanimously
held
by
the
eleventh
circuit,
based
on
its
special
familiarity
with
florida
jurisprudence,
florida's
rule
is
not
one
of
strict
forfeiture
of
claims
not
raised
at
trial
or
on
appeal.
there
is
a
provision
for
new
constitutional
holdings
of
either
this
court
or
the
florida
supreme
court
and
for
fundamental
constitutional
error
to
be
considered
even
if
not
raised
at
trial
or
on
direct
appeal.
the
eleventh
circuit's
opinion
gives
examples
of
that,
this
court's
holding
in
enmund,
a
situation
where
the
state
had
withheld
evidence
helpful
to
the
defendant.
and
this
exception
also
applies
here
to
allow
consideration
of
mr.
adams'
caldwell
claim.
the
problem
is
that
the
florida
supreme
court,
because
of
its
erroneous
view
of
the
merits,
has
not
recognized
that
the
exception
applies.
that
this
is,
in
fact,
the
reason
why
they
have
not
applied
the
exception
here
is
illustrated
by
the
florida
supreme
court's
treatment
of
lockett
claims
before
and
after
this
court's
decision
last
year
in
hitchcock.
before
hitchcock,
the
florida
supreme
court
applied
the
procedural
bar
to
stop
claims
of
people
whose
trials
had
occurred
after
1978
saying
you
had...
if
this
claim
had
any
basis,
which
we
don't
think
it
does,
but
if
it
did
have
any
merit,
you
had
basis
under
our
state
law
decision
in
a
case
called
songer
and
under
lockett
to
make
this
claim.
but
we're
going
to
not
consider
the
claim.
and
they
so
held
in
a
case
called
copeland,
505
so.2d
425
(1987).
then
shortly
after
that
this
court
unanimously
informed
the
florida
supreme
court
and
the
rest
of
the
world
in
the
hitchcock
decision
that
the
florida
supreme
court's
view
of
the
merits
of
that
claim
were
wrong,
and
that
in
fact
there
had
been
a
constitutional
violation
under
hitchcock.
then
what
did
the
florida
supreme
court
do
after
that?
very
interesting.
they
have
now
gone
and
considered
the
merits
of
all
hitchcock
claims,
including
ones
for
trials
after
1978.
in
fact,
the
combs
case
which
ms.
roper
cited
for
its
discussion
of
the
caldwell
issue,
is
an
example
of
a
trial
that
occurred
after
1978
in
which
the
florida
supreme
court,
following
this
court's
decision
in
hitchcock,
said,
hitchcock
is
a
sufficient
change
in
law.
therefore,
we
will
now
consider
the
merits
and
rule
in
favor
of
your
lockett
claim.
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
i
do
believe
so,
but
i
also
believe--
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
--first
i
should
note
that
is
not
a
question
before
the
court.
it
has
never
been
raised
below.
i
don't
think
the
court
should
decide
that
now.
but
the
reason
why,
if
the
court
somehow
were
to
decide
that,
is
that
it
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
decision
making
process
and
is
a
misleading
of
the
decision
maker
which
goes
to
the
core
of
the
court's
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence.
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
it
should
make
it
retroactive
the
same
way
that
lockett
has
been
applied
retroactively
and
all
of
the
court's
other
eighth
amendment
cases
have
been
applied
retroactively
because
when
life
is
at
stake
and
we
know
before
the
person
is
put
to
death
that
a
core
principle
under
the
eighth
amendment,
namely,
the
reliability
of
the
jury's
verdict,
has
been
undermined
by
a
judge
who
has
deliberately
undermined
the
jury's
sense
of
responsibility
by
repeatedly
telling
them
that
their
decision
would
have
no
weight,
that
it
would
not
be
their
responsibility,
that
it
was
not
on
their
conscience,
that
when
that
which
goes
to
the
heart
of
what
this
court--
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
--that
it
should
not
be--
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
--applied
retroactively?
i
am
not
aware
of
it,
and--
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
--i
don't
think
that
i
am
prepared,
since
we
did
not
brief
the
subject,
nor
did
the
state,
nor
was
it
raised
below,
nor
was
it
decided
below...
am
prepared
to
make
such
a
sweeping
pronouncement.
what
i
am
prepared
to
say
is
that
if,
contrary
to
the
usual
practice
of
this
court,
it
were
somehow
to
leap
out
and
decide
that
issue
in
this
case,
that
in
this
case,
under
the
circumstances
here,
it
should
be
applied
retroactively.
but
i
don't
think
that's
necessary
to
a
decision
of
this
case
just
as
the
other
side
stated
in
their
brief.
i
also
think
that,
to
finish
my
analysis,
that
the
real
problem
here,
as
is
pointed
out
by
what
they
have
done
in
the
hitchcock
situation
is
that
the
florida
supreme
court
does
not
recognize
the
applicability
of
caldwell
to
this
case.
they
criticize
the
decision
of
the
eleventh
circuit
in
combs.
if
they
do
realize,
based
on
a
decision
today
by
this
court
on
the
merits,
that
as
they
were
wrong
in
hitchcock,
they
are
also
wrong
here,
then
to
be
consistent
with
what
they
have
done
in
the
hitchcock
situation,
they
would
also
have
to
apply
their
new
law
exception
here.
in
fact,
they
have
pretty
much
hinted
as
much
in
a
case
called
card
v.
state.
they
said,
well,
we're
not
going
to
consider
your
caldwell
claim
because
the
eleventh
circuit's
decision
in
adams
and
in
mann
is
not
come
under
our
new
law
exception
because
only
decisions
of
the
united
states
supreme
court
or
the
florida
supreme
court
would
come
under
that
exception.
well,
that
all
but
says
that
if
this
court
now
reaches
the
merits
and
tells
them
again
that
they
were
wrong,
as
i
believe
they
clearly
are
wrong,
on
the
merits,
then
they
will
apply
their
exception
and
they
will
consider
such
claims.
and
it
would
be
anomalous
were
only
mr.
adams
not
to
get
the
benefit
of
the
holding
established
in
his
case.
thus,
as
the
eleventh
circuit
concluded,
the
florida
supreme
court
is
either
relying
on
its
mistaken
view
of
the
federal
constitutional
law
or
is
inconsistently
applying
its
procedural
bar,
and
either
way,
there
is
no
independent
and
adequate
state
ground
in
this
case.
now,
i'd
also
like
to
point
out
that,
as
was
suggested
in
justice
o'connor's
questioning,
there
is
no
abuse
of
the
writ
issue
presented
in
the
cert
petition
and,
in
fact,
even
the
amicus
curiae
who
favored
the
state
of
florida
in
this
case,
when
they
purported
to
rearticulate
the
two
issues
in
this
case,
said
that
the
two
issues
were
the
merits
of
the
caldwell
claim
and
procedural
default.
so,
even
they
did
not
perceive
what
isn't
there.
now,
turning
back
to
the
merits,
as
you
may
well
know
from
reading
the
brief,
the
judge
in
this
case
instructed
the
jury
no
less
than
11
times
that
the
sentencing
decision
was
in
no
way
whatsoever
the
jury's
responsibility,
did
not
fall
on
its
shoulders,
and
that
the
imposition
of
the
death
sentence
would
not
be
on
its
conscience,
but
solely
on
his.
he
said
i
don't
want
you
to
feel
that
you
determine
whether
he
lives
or
dies
because
you
don't.
and
he
repeatedly
said
that
i
can
disregard
your
recommendation.
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
it
misstates
state
law.
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
i
think
that's
so
for
one
important
reason,
that
the
objection,
in
order
to
be
pertinent
to
the
cause
and
prejudice
standard,
must
be...
with
respect
to
this
claim,
the
claim
that
we
are
now
raising
here
is
not
a
state
law
objection.
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
well--
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
--justice--
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
--justice
kennedy,
the
state
of
florida
has
never
recognized
even
to
this
day
when
it
gets
cases
like
combs
that
what
has
occurred
in
cases
like
adams
is
a
state
law
violation--
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
--and
nobody--
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
--the
fact
of
the
matter
is
i
would
state,
mr.
justice
kennedy,
is
that
the
state
law
was
not
clearly
applied
and
has
not
been
clearly
applied
to
the
undermining
of
a
jury's
sense
of
responsibility
under
the
current
capital
sentencing
scheme.
the
florida
supreme
court
does
not...
the...
the...
the
key
part
that
was
a
misstatement
was
a
misstatement
of
what
the
jury's
role
is.
the
florida
supreme
court,
under
its
current
death
penalty
system,
has
never
recognized
that
to
undermine
the
jury's
sense
of
responsibility
under
the
current
death
penalty
system
in
florida
violates
florida
law.
if
they
did
realize
that,
they
would
have
ruled
in
favor
of
these
claims
in
situations
like
combs
where
they're
not
applying
a
procedural
bar.
the
fact
also
is
that
nobody
in
florida
perceived
this
claim,
no
one
objected
on
the
basis
of
the
state
law
claim,
and
it
is
important
that
when
the
eighth
amendment
provides
an
independent
basis,
regardless
of
whether
under
florida
law
there
is
a
view
about
undermining
juries'
sense
of
responsibility
under
their
current
death
penalty
system,
which
there
is
no
such
principle
that
they've
recognized...
it
is,
nevertheless,
important
under
eighth
amendment
law
that
when
the
eighth
amendment
is
violated,
that
relief
be
granted.
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
it
does
require
that,
but
it--
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
--that
could
have
been
objected
to
but,
your
honor,
it
would
not
have
established
the
basis
for
this
claim
if
he
had
gone
to
any
court,
including
federal
court,
having
not
been
granted
relief,
as
he
would
not
have
been
granted
relief,
in
the
state
courts.
what
this
reminds
me
of,
your
honor--
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
--is
some
day
there
will
be
a
cure
discovered
for
aids,
a
drug
will
be
developed,
and
undoubtedly
that
drug
will
include
variety
of
chemicals
that
are
now
available.
the
problem
is
that
there
will
have
to
have
been
developed
a
formula
to
figure
out
how
to
make
that
into
a
successful
solution
for
aids.
now,
here
the
fact
that
there
was
a
violation
of
florida's
accurate
sentencing
description
is
an
element
of
the
eighth
amendment
claim.
but
it
is
not
enough
to
win
on
the
eighth
amendment
claim,
which
is
the
claim
we're
making
here,
without
caldwell
which
for
the
first
time
established
that
it
is
a
key
eighth
amendment
concept
that
the
jury's
sense
of
its
awesome
responsibility
not
be
undermined.
now,
once
you
have
that,
then
you
have
the
claim.
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
this
trial
judge,
i
submit,
would
not
have
done
it
based
on
every
indication
that
he
gave
in
his
11
different
times
when
he
said
the
most
important
thing
you
should
understand
is
that
the
jury
does
not
have
any
responsibility.
and
i
submit
that
the
florida
supreme
court,
based
on
its
recent
jurisprudence,
would
also
not
have
ruled
in
favor
of
such
a
claim.
and
if
adams
before
caldwell
had
tried
to
raise
the
claim
in
federal
court,
he
also
would
have
not
gotten
any
relief.
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
no.
it
would
have
said
the
instruction
is
not
correct,
but--
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
--that
it
is
okay
because
their
view
of
what
is
undermining
the
jury's
actual
sense
of
responsibility
suggests
to
them
that
relief
should
not
be
granted.
the
fact
is
the
only
place
where
mr.
adams
can
get
relief
is
in
the
federal
court
based
on
the
eighth
amendment
claim.
and
that
is
why
the
development
of
caldwell
is
so
crucial
to
this
case
and
why,
if
this
court
were,
as
i
submit
it
should
not,
get
into
a
cause
and
prejudice
analysis,
since
there
is
no
independent
and
adequate
state
ground...
but
if
the
court
were
to
get
into
such
analysis,
it
should
conclude
that
there
is
cause
because
this
claim
could
not
have
been
raised
prior
to
the
decision
in
caldwell.
and
it
is
only
this
claim
that
mr.
adams
could
possibly
have
succeeded
on.
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
but,
your
honor,
the
ruler
as
i
understand
the
rule
of
engle
v.
isaac,
reed
v.
ross,
smith
v.
murray,
is
all
in
the
context
of
federal
constitutional
violations
and
its
principles
of
federalism.
the
court
has
not
granted
and
won't
grant
claims...
no
federal
court
will
grant
a
claim
merely
because
a
state
law
has
been
violated.
there
must
be
a
federal
constitutional
violation,
and
the
issue
then
is
whether
there
were
the
tools
to
make
the
federal
constitutional
claim.
there
were
many
states
in
which
before
reed
v.
ross...
what
there
might
not
have
been
proper,
but
the
fact
is
that
what's
at
issue
is
whether
the
elements
of...
all
of
the
elements
of
the
federal
constitutional
claim
were
available
and
the
were
not
available
here.
the
fact
that
he
could
have
made
some
other
claim
for
which
there
were
perhaps
more
tools
available
does
not
make
the
eighth
amendment
claim
available,
and
it
wasn't
available.
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
well,
if--
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
--i
think
in
that
circumstance,
the
florida
supreme
court
on
direct
appeal
would
probably
have
noticed
this
on
its
own.
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
if
this
were
a
correct
statement
of
state
law,
then
caldwell
would
not
have
anything
to
do
with
it.
that's
a
necessary--
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
--that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
and
there
was
no
objection
just
like
there
has
been
no
objection
in
any
of
these
other
cases
in
florida
at
the
time.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
for
them
to
have
perceived
that
this
would
be
improper
would
have
taken
a
combination--
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
--apparently
there
is
no
such
magician
under...
in
the
florida
bar
because
no
one
objected
under
this
ground
in
the
numerous
cases
that
such
statements
were
made,
although
there
are
none
where
it's
quite
as
bad
as
in
this
case.
i
think--
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
justice
white--
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
--it
is
old
too.
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
i
fully
agree
that
a
good,
astute
lawyer
might
well--
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
--they
might
well
have
objected
to
this,
but
the
fact
is
that
that
would
not
have
given
them
a...
this
claim,
this
eighth
amendment
claim,
prior
to
caldwell,
and
the
fact
is
that
none
of
them
did--
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
--assert
this
claim.
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
i
understand
that
it's
part
of
the
claim,
but
it
is
not
all
of
the
tools
to
make
the
eighth
amendment
claim,
your
honor,
and
those...
so
that
not
all
the
tools
were
available
to
make
this
claim.
and
the
claim
they
could
have
made...
there's
no
indication
would
have
gone
anywhere
even
though
there
was
a
misstatement
of
state
law.
i
also
would
suggest
that
when
you...
and
i
think
that
the
same,
exact
thing
was
said
by
the
florida
supreme
court
in
this
case
i
talked
about
before,
in
the
case
of
copeland.
they
said
as
to
the
lockett
claim,
you
had
a
perfect
basis
for
objecting
under
state
law.
we
said
in
1978
in
songer
that
the
jury
must
be
allowed
to
consider
non-statutory
mitigating
circumstances,
and
you
also
had
lockett
which
said
that
it's
an
eighth
amendment
violation
to
deprive
the
jury
of
the
right
not
to
consider
these
circumstances.
you
had
everything
you
needed.
therefore,
if
this
claim
did
have
merit,
you
should
have
raised
it.
but
then,
that's
exactly
what
they
are
now
saying
about
the
caldwell
claims.
in
fact,
they
said
the
very
same
thing
immediately
following
that
in
the
copeland
decision.
but
once
they
found
out
that
their
interpretation
of
the
eighth
amendment
was
wrong,
they
have
allowed
people
like
combs
to
go
back
and
raise
the
same
claim
under
their
procedure
even
though
they
have
just
finished
saying
the
year
earlier
in
copeland
that
you
should
have
objected
at
trial.
so,
i
submit
that
all
of
this
questioning,
although
intellectually
interesting,
is
not
pertinent
to
the
proper
outcome
of
this
case
because
there
is
no
independent
and
adequate
state
ground
here.
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
no,
we
do
not.
mr.
ronald
j.
tabak
yes,
i
do,
your
honor,
justice
stevens.
it
is
505
so.2d
425.
what
then
occurred
in
that
case
was
this
court
vacated
and
remanded
in
light
of
hitchcock,
and
they
are
now
having
rebriefing
of
that
case
on
the
harmless
error
question,
the
state
having
conceded
a
hitchcock
violation.
the
combs
case
where
they
do
consider
the
claim
in
a
1980
trial
is
525
so.2d
853
at
page
855.
so,
i
submit
that
when
you
take
what
they
have
done
with
the
hitchcock
claims
before
and
after
caldwell...
and
before
and
after
hitchcock,
i
should
say,
you
will
see
an
exact
parallel
to
this
situation.
and
there
simply
is
no
independent
and
adequate
state
ground
here.
i
would
also
submit
that
on
the
record
of
this
case,
it
is
one
in
which
a
reasonable
juror
who
accurately
understood
what
the
jury's
important
role
is
in
capital
sentencing
where
in
reality
most
of
the
time
where
there
is
an
override
by
the
judge,
the
judge
is
himself
overridden,
a
jury
that
had
this
on
its
conscience
could
reasonably
have
voted
a
life
sentence.
and
if
they
had
done
so,
and
even
if
it...
that
had
been
overridden,
the
override
would
itself
have
been
overridden
by
the
florida
supreme
court
because
as
it
was,
the
trial
judge
found
that
there
were
three
mitigating
circumstances,
as
well
as
three
aggravating
circumstances.
and
in
the
florida
supreme
court
even
without
an
override,
there
were
two
justices
who
dissented
on
the
ground
that
in
similar
florida
cases,
where
hopefully
the
juries
did
understand
their
responsibility,
life
was
the
sentence
that
was
usually
granted
on
facts
like
these.
in
this
kind
of
circumstance,
i
submit
the
violation
is
even
worse
than
in
caldwell
because
the
person
who
was
repeatedly
undermining
the
jury's
responsibility
was
the
trial
judge,
and
he
was
telling
them
that
the
fact
that
it
was
not
on
their
conscience
is
the
most
important
thing
that
they
should
remember.
yet,
under
florida
law,
the
jury
is
given
such
great
weight
because
it
is
the
conscience
of
the
community.
and
nobody
stepped
in
to
stress
the
importance
of
the
jury's
role.
i
also
submit
that
there
is
prejudice
in
this
case
because
of
what
i
have
just
stated
about
what
would
have
occurred
had
the
misstatement
not
occurred.
on
the
rest
of
the
subject
of
cause,
i
should
also
note
briefly
that,
as
stated
in
our
brief,
there
simply
was
no
court
anywhere...
that
we
have
found
anywhere
in
the
country
that
came
up
with
an
eighth
amendment
decision
anything
like
caldwell
at
the
time
of
the
trial
or
appeal
in
this
case,
unlike
the
situation
in
smith
v.
murray
or
in
engle
v.
isaac.
and
in
fact,
there
isn't
one
rejecting
such
a
claim
because
we
have
not
seen
any
indication
that
anybody
anywhere
in
the
country
at
that
time
had
formulated
such
a
claim.
and
i
submit
that
in
that
kind
of
circumstances
the
cause
is
not
resent.
i
have
explained
again
why
i
believe
abuse
of
the
writ
is
not
before
the
court.
if
there
are
questions
further
at
this
point,
i'd
be
happy
to
answer
them.
otherwise,
i'd
like
to
thank
the
court
for
its
attention.
