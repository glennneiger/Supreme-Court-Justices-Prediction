mr.
hurley,
can
i
interrupt
you
with
a
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
i
understand
it,
a
crossover
with
a
great
deal
of
seniority
might
retain
the
job
even
under
the
court
of
appeals'
holding.
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
we
know
how
many
of
the
crossovers...
under
the
court
of
appeals'
holding,
how
many
of
the
crossovers
will
retain
their
jobs,
and
how
many
will
lose
them
to
strikers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
the
theory
that
they
would...
by
remaining,
they
would
in
effect
jump
ahead
of
those
who
otherwise
would
have
seniority
over
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
they
didn't
have
as
much
seniority
as
some
of
the
strikers.
