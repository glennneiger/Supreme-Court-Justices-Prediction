justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
your
view,
could
you
have
entered
a
contract
requiring
replacement
of
the
crossover
strikers
by
the
full-time
strikers?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
have?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
could
you
have,
legally?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
how
is
that
consistent
with
your
position
that
the
crossover
strikers
have
a
right
to
reinstatement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
they
have
a
right
under
the
statute,
your
contract
can't
trump
the
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
you
say
that
by
contract,
you
could
require
replacement
of
the
crossover
strikers.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there's...
in
the
hypothetical
case
that
you
ended.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
it
doesn't
follow
that
by
statute
there's
a
right
to...
to
reinstatement.
the
statute
by
itself
doesn't
grant
that
right,
because
if
it
did,
you
couldn't
contract,
and
you've
conceded
that
you
could
contract
to
replace
those
crossover
strikers.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
neither
did
i.
that's
why
i'm
asking.
you
say
that
you...
you
could
make
a
contract,
in
the
hypothetical
case--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--to
require
that
those
crossover
strikers
be
displaced.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
both
parties
have
agreed
on
the
contract.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
then
it
must
follow
that
the
statute
does
not
give
a
right
to
the
crossover
strikers
to
be
reinstated.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
did
they
have
a
right
to
those
jobs,
when
they
sought
them?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
see
how
that's
consistent
with
your
view
that
by
contract
you
could
have
stipulated
otherwise.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
you...
let's
take
it
a
step
further.
if
you
acceded
at
this
point
to
the
union's
demand,
just
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
with
no
contract
provision,
there
would
be
no
statutory
violation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
far
as
the
employer,
the
employer
would
not
be
violating
the
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
employer
is
caught
between
two
conflicting
duties?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right,
then
the
duty
arises
only
because
of
the
promise
that
the
employer
makes,
and
that
doesn't
tell
us
whether
or
not
what
the
employer
promised
was
legally
binding.
mr.
gartner,
were
there
any
employees
here
who
were
on
strike
and
then
volunteered
to
come
back
to
work,
but
couldn't
be
hired
because
there
were
no
vacancies?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
waivable
only
by
contract?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
xxx
seniority,
that
had
more
seniority
than
they
did.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
they
didn't
get
hurt
any
more
than
they
would
have
if
there
had
been
a
big
layoff?
no
strike,
but
a
big
layoff.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
have
to
get
down
to
saying
that
you're
entitled,
with
respect
to
the
crossovers...
you're
entitled
to
treat
them
as,
because
they
continued
to
work,
as
having,
as
being
able
to
overcome
their
lack
of
seniority?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
employer
kept
them
on.
they
wanted
to
stay
on,
and
they
stayed
on.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
they
have
to
claim,
in
order
to
overcome
the
returning
strikers'
seniority,
they
have
to
use
the
same
argument
that
the
new
hires
use,
i
suppose?
they
really
have
to...
they
really
have
to
rely
on
what
the
employer's
entitled
to
do
when
you
have
a
war.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
they
weren't...
they
weren't
protected
against
people
with
more
seniority.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
mean
like
hiring
replacements?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
is
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
what
really
gives
the
new
hires
their
position
against
the
strikers...
namely,
the
employer's
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
wouldn't
that...
why
isn't
that
the
same
with
respect
to
the
crossovers?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
point
is
the
right,
though,
to
run
his
business
is
still
there.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
justifies
the
new
hires
staying
on.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
the
court
in,
perhaps,
dictum
say
anything
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
the...
could
the
employer
have
refused
to
accept
crossovers?
here's
a
strike,
he
wants
to
run
his
plant,
he
hires...
he's
hiring
new
employees.
could
he
discriminate
against
the
crossovers,
if
they
wanted
to
come
back?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
he
just
says
"i'm
not
hiring
crossovers.
"
"i'm
not
going
to
take
back
crossovers.
"
"i'm
afraid
they'll
have
to
get
rid
of
them
later.
"
"you
know,
that
case
the
supreme
court
decided.
"
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
could
he
take
them
back
subject
to
being
replaced
by
a
returning
striker
with
more
seniority?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean
he
could
expressly?
