but
even
if
the...
even
if
the
contract
does
subsist,
there
is
no
right
in
that
contract
of
the
sort
that
was
the
basis
for
the
decision
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
in
erie?
weren't
there
crossovers
involved
in
erie?
justice
antonin
scalia
weren't
they
allowed
to
keep
their
jobs?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
were.
and
the
only
problem
there
was
super-seniority.
well,
that
was
quite
a
problem.
well,
i
agree,
i
agree.
[laughter]
but
the
crossovers
could
keep
their
jobs.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
returning
strikers
couldn't
boot
them
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
you
explain
to
me...
never
mind
the
precedent...
why
it
is
that
hiring
a
new
employee
impermissibly
trenches
upon
the
right
to
strike
of
those
that
have
chosen
to
do
so?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
impermissibly
interferes
with
that
right
to
strike
but
keeping
on
a
crossover
who
chooses
to
stay
on...
i'm
sorry,
does
not
impermissibly,
whereas
keeping
on
a
crossover
does.
why
does...
why
is
the
one
worse
than
the
other?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
a
different
argument.
that
isn't
punishing
somebody
for
striking,
any
more
than
something
else.
this
is
an
argument
that
it...
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
there
a
right
not
to
strike,
as
well
as--
justice
antonin
scalia
--don't
you
think
it
punishes
the
right...
exercises
the
right
not
to
strike,
to
tell
somebody
you're
welcome
not
to,
but
you're
going
to
pay
whatever
cost
the
strike
entails
anyway,
whether
you
choose
not
to
or
not.
doesn't
the
punish
the
exercise
of
the
right
not
to
strike?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe,
but
surely
the
biggest
risk
of
a
strike
for
an
employee
is
that
the
employee
will
be
replaced
entirely
and
there
will
be
no
job
left
when
the
strike
is
over...
isn't
that
the
biggest
risk?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
are
telling
the
employee
who
stays
on,
and
chooses
not
to
strike,
that
even
though
you
stay
on,
and
choose
not
to
strike,
the
biggest
risk
of
the
strike
will
be
visited
upon
you.
if
you
are
the
last
in
the
order
of
seniority,
and
there
is
one
new
hire
or
one
new
employee
put,
one
new
hire,
you're
the
one
who's
going
to
be
bounced
because
of
it.
now,
why
isn't
that
punishing
that
employee's
decision
not
to
strike?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
really
plausible
to
have
this
sort
of
conversation
between
two
union
members,
one
of
whom
has
a
lot
of
seniority
and
one
of
whom
has
virtually
none.
the
latter
does
not
want
a
strike,
and
the
former
tells
him,
"well,
you're
welcome
to
go
back
in,
if
you
want,
but
you'll
just
be
holding
my
job
for
me,
because
as
soon
as
this
strike's
over,
i'm
going
to
take
it,
and
you'll
be
laid
off.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
matter
of
not
being
penalized,
he's
actually
being
rewarded
for
the
other
workers'
refusal
to
strike.
he
should
encourage
the
fellow
to
go
and
say,
you
know,
"i
want
to
strike,
but
i
urge
you
to
go
back
to
hold
my
job,
because
otherwise....
"
[laughter]
otherwise
he
may
put
in
a
new
hire,
and
i
wouldn't
be
able
to
get
my
job
back.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
if
there
is
a
pool
of
available...
sometimes
there
isn't
a
pool
of
replacements
available.
if
you
do
have
a
pool
of
new
flight
attendants
out
there
who
are
willing
to
take
up
the
jobs,
it
would
follow,
then,
that
it
would
be
worse
for
the
striker
to
have
an
entirely
new
replacement
hired
than
to
have
a
junior
striker
go
back.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
want
to...
could
you...
do
you
agree
with
the
last
statement
that
had
there
been
no
promise
of
permanent
employment
here--
