mr.
murray
gartner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
arises
from
an
economic
strike
against
twa
by
the
union
representing
its
flight
attendants,
known
as
iffa.
when
the
strike
was
called
off
by
the
union
in
may
of
1986,
after
more
than
two
months,
twa
was
operating
a
full
schedule
with
a
workforce
consisting
of
2,800
new
hires
and
some
1,200
incumbents,
or
crossovers...
that
is,
pre-strike
flight
attendants
who
chose
to
remain
at
work
or
to
resume
working
during
the
strike.
at
that
time,
there
were
only
200
vacancies.
twa
filled
them
by
re-hiring
unreinstated
strikers
in
seniority
order.
since
that
time,
more
than
2,500
strikers
have
been
rehired
to
fill
additional
vacancies.
upon
rehire,
they
have
been
credited
with
their
full
pre-strike
seniority.
the
eighth
circuit,
however,
held
that
twa
had
violated
the
railway
labor
act
when
the
strike
ended
because
it
did
not
remove
incumbents
from
their
jobs
and
replace
them
with
strikers
who
had
more
pre-strike
seniority.
since
the
court
below,
however,
affirmed
the
right
of
new
hires
under
the
railway
labor
act
to
keep
their
jobs
against
the
claims
of
unreinstated
strikers,
the
question
raised
by
its
decision
is
why
the
railway
labor
act,
unlike
the
nlra,
requires
a
carrier
at
the
end
of
a
strike
to
treat
some
1,200
incumbent
employees
less
favorably
than
new
hires.
mr.
murray
gartner
i
don't
think
they
were,
justice
scalia.
there's
50
years
of
precedent
which
says
they're
right,
and
the
solicitor
general
has
filed
a
brief
on
behalf
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
which
says
that
they
were
right.
the
district
court
thought
they
were
right
and
i
think...
i
think
they're
right.
[laughter]
to
the
extent
that
that
decision,
however,
was
based
on
the
eighth
circuit's
view
of
the
nlra
decisions,
i
will
leave
the
argument
that
the
court
misapprehended
long-established
nlra
law
to
the
solicitor
general,
who
is
here
on
behalf
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
i
will
address
the
arguments
about
the
rla,
which
the
respondent
now
makes
without
any
support
from
the
decision
below.
respondent
says
that
the
rla
section
2
fourth...
and
this
court's
decision
in
florida
east
coast
railway,
require
that
the
risk
of
job
loss
inherent
in
any
strike
much
be
shifted
from
those
who
choose
to
remain
on
strike
to
those
employees
who
choose
to
work.
neither
the
statutory
section,
we
believe,
nor
the
court's
decision,
separately
or
together,
lead
to
that
result.
section
2
fourth
clearly
is
focused,
as
its
first
sentence
reveals,
on
the
employees'
"right
to
organize
and
bargain
collectively
through
representatives
of
their
own
choosing.
"
it
does
not
mention
strikes,
strikers,
or
concerted
activities.
by
contrast,
the
nlra
has
section
23,
which
defines
strikers
as
employees
until
they
secure
substantially
equivalent
employment.
rla
section
1
fifth,
however,
contains
no
such
definition.
section
7
and
8(a)(1)
of
the
nlra
taken
together
like
rla
section
2
fourth
prohibit
interference
or
coercion
in
the
employees'
right
to
form
or
join
unions
or
not
to
do
so.
but
in
addition,
those
sections
specifically
and
broadly
protect
concerted
activities,
and
have
no
counterpart
in
the
rla.
nlra
section
13
also
without
any
counterpart
in
the
rla
specifically
protects
the
right
to
strike.
rla
section
2
fourth,
therefore,
cannot
reasonably
be
thought
to
give
more
protection
to
strikes
and
strikers
than
the
specific
provisions
of
the
nlra
dealing
with
those
subjects.
if
anything,
it
must
give
less.
most
of
the
decisions
of
the
lower
courts
construing
it,
in
fact,
as
the
amicus
brief
of
the
air
conference
shows,
have
confined
that
section
to
pre-certification
interference
with
the
organization
of
unions,
or
with
an
egregious
threat
to
the
representation
function
of
a
union.
certainly
respondent
cites
no
case
in
which
section
2
fourth
has
been
construed
as
broader
in
scope
than
the
nlra
provisions.
and
this
court's
decisions
under
the
nlra
have
made
it
very
clear
that
even
though
the
filling
of
places
left
vacant
by
strikers
may
have
a
coercive
effect
on
the
exercise
of
the
right
to
strike,
it
is
not
prohibited
coercion.
congress
permitted
that
effect
as
part
of
the
intended
balance
between
the
exercise
of
self-help
by
employer
and
employees.
the
remainder
of
respondent's
argument
about
the
rla
is
that
this
court's
decision
in
florida
east
coast
railway...
of
course
the
court
is
familiar
with
that
decision,
and
the
discussion
of
it
which
we
had
in
the
case
which
we
refer
to
as
twa
1,
which
is
still
pending,
petition
for
rehearing
in
this
court.
the
respondent
says
that
that
decision
requires
the
continuation
of
pre-strike
working
conditions
into
and
beyond
the
self-help
period.
respondent
argues
that
therefore
the
seniority
system
as
it
refers
to
it,
in
the
1981-84
contract
between
twa
and
iffa,
which
the
district
court
held
did
not
include
any
right
of
unreinstated
strikers
to
displace
incumbents...
that
that
seniority
system
somehow
expands
because
of
the
statute
to
confer
that
right
of
displacement
after
the
expiration
date
of
the
contract.
in
other
words,
respondent
says
that
a
right
conferred
neither
by
contract
nor
by
statute
somehow
is
born
from
the
interplay
of
that
contract
and
that
statute.
mr.
murray
gartner
yes,
sir.
mr.
murray
gartner
yes,
your
honor,
yes,
justice
scalia,
we
would.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
argued
in
twa
1,
as
your
honor
is
aware,
that
fec
does
not
require
the
continuation
of
contracts
which
have
expired
by
their
terms.
but
even
if
it
did,
it
could
not
impose
on
the
carrier
the
obligation
to
observe
a
seniority
right
not
granted
by
the
contract.
and
clearly
if
this
court
should
hold
that
the
contract
including
all
of
the
seniority
provisions
which
it
did
have
has
expired,
there
then
cannot
be
any
basis
on
which
to
say
that
because
those
particular
and
limited
seniority
provisions
once
existed,
seniority
principles
in
respondents'
words
require
the
carrier
in
the
self-help
period
to
allow
unreinstated
strikers
to
displace
incumbent
employees.
mr.
murray
gartner
your
honor,
we
thought
you
were
wrong,
and
we
argued
that
at
that
time,
that
the
eighth
circuit
clearly
said
in
that
decision
that
the
construction
of
the
contract
was
driven
by
its
interpretation
of
the
statutes.
mr.
murray
gartner
oh,
well,
i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood
the
question.
i
think
that's
correct.
the
eighth
circuit,
however,
relied
upon
the
survival
of
the
union
security
clause,
which
was
one
result
of
its
decision
in
twa
1.
but
the
respondent
has
now
disavowed
that
ground
for
the
decision.
respondent
says
in
his
brief
that
that's
irrelevant,
and
we
agree.
the...
as
things
stand,
it
appears
that
congress
left
the
resolution
of
whatever
disputes
remain
after
the
stage
of
economic
warfare
to
agreement
by
the
parties,
and
here
there
was
no
back-to-work
agreement.
as
this
court
said
in
burlington
northern,
if
the
statute
does
not
deal
with
the
subject,
it
is
for
congress,
not
for
this
court,
to
establish
rules
to
govern
the
exercise
of
self-help.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
court
discerns
in
some
language
of
the
rla
some
intent
by
congress
to
confer
rights
on
strikers,
in
the
absence
of
expressed
language,
legislative
history
or
other
guidelines,
and
in
view
of
the
different
provisions
in
the
two
statutes,
congress
cannot
have
intended
those
rights
to
be
greater
than
the
rights
which
the
court
has
held
exist
under
the
nlra.
mr.
murray
gartner
would
we
have?
no.
mr.
murray
gartner
could
we
have?
yes,
but
we
would
not
have,
because--
mr.
murray
gartner
--yes,
i
think
so.
i
think--
mr.
murray
gartner
--well,
they
have
a
right
in
the
absence
of
an
agreement.
if
there
is...
the
union
has
the
right
to--
mr.
murray
gartner
--well,
they
don't
have...
i'm
sorry,
i
miss
you
somewhere,
because
i'm
not--
mr.
murray
gartner
--saying
they
have
a
right
under
the
statute.
mr.
murray
gartner
yes.
mr.
murray
gartner
yes.
mr.
murray
gartner
i
don't
see
how
that
has
impact
on
the
statute.
if
the
statute--
mr.
murray
gartner
--yes.
mr.
murray
gartner
if
the
union
chooses
to
represent
its
people
in
that
way.
mr.
murray
gartner
right.
yes.
mr.
murray
gartner
i
have
not...
i
haven't
argued
that
the...
that
the
statute
gives
them
a
right
to
be
reinstated.
i
would
say
the
statute
gives
them
a
right
to
stay
in
their
job.
it's
not
a
question
of
reinstatement.
they
are
in
the
jobs
at
the
end
of
the
strike.
mr.
murray
gartner
of
course.
they
were
permanent
employees
when
they
were...
before
the
strike,
and
they
came
back
to
their
jobs.
mr.
murray
gartner
because
the
union
is
the
representative,
or
it
claims
to
be
the
representative,
of
all
of
the
employees,
and
if
the
union
decides
that
it
wants
to
negotiate
to
favor
some
of
its
people
on
the
basis
of
seniority,
if
that's
the
basis
of
which
they
choose,
they
are
the
representative.
they
have
the
right
to
enter
into
that
kind
of
an
agreement.
that
does
not
mean
that
the
company
would
not
still
be
liable
in
state
court
for
the
promises
which
it
made
to
the
new
hires
and
the
crossovers
that
we
would
not
enter
into
such
a
contract.
that
was
the
promise
that
we
made,
that
twa
made
to
them,
that
we
would
not
enter
into
such
a
contract.
and
we're
not...
we
are
not
arguing
that
the
crossovers
have
a
statutory
right
to
their
job.
we're
simply
saying
that
they
are
in
the
job,
and
the
union
has
no
claim
to
displace
them
by
statute.
mr.
murray
gartner
there
might
be
a
violation
of
the
duty
to
represent,
to
fairly
represent
the
employees.
mr.
murray
gartner
i
don't...
from
the
standpoint
of
the
employer,
i
don't
believe
there
would
be
a
statutory
violation.
mr.
murray
gartner
well,
it
is,
because
he's
caught
between
the
conflicting
obligation
which
he
has
to
the
crossovers
and
to
the
new
hires
that
he
had
promised
them
that
he
would
not
enter
into
such
a
contract.
it's
one
phase
of
belknap
v.
hale.
mr.
murray
gartner
not
while
the
strike
was
on,
justice
o'connor.
i
have...
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
if
i
may,
simply
with
the
comment
that
there
has
not
been
any
sound
reason
advanced
why
the
rule
as
to
the
rights
of
crossovers
to
their
jobs
should
be
different
under
the
rla
and
under
the
nlra,
creating
a
dichotomy
in
national
labor
policy.
mr.
murray
gartner
no,
your
honor,
that's
unfortunately
not
here.
you
didn't
take
it.
[laughter]
mr.
murray
gartner
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
murray
gartner
no.
no,
there
was
no
promise.
the
question
is
not
a
question
of
promise
of
permanent
employment,
it
was
a
promise
that
the
company
would
not
enter
into
an
agreement
waiving
the
rights
which
these
people
had
with
the
union.
these
people
had
permanent
jobs.
this
is...
they...
the
company
did
not
have
to
give
them
a
promise
that
they
would
have
permanent
jobs.
they
had
permanent
jobs
before
the
strike
began.
mr.
murray
gartner
but
the
seniority--
mr.
murray
gartner
--is
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
as
mr.
hurley
said,
seniority
is
a
creature
of
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
normally
what
happens
after
a
strike
is
that
you
have
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
known
as
a
back-to-work
agreement.
there
was
no
such
back-to-work
agreement
here.
the
district
court
found
that
the
original
contract,
whether
it
expired
or
not
doesn't
matter,
did
not
contain
this
seniority
right.
seniority
is
not
something
which
is
a
neutral
principle,
as
mr.
hurley
says.
seniority
is
something
that
unions
fight
for,
and
if
they
get
it
in
a
contract,
the
contract
specifies
what
it
can
be
used
for.
there's
nothing
in
the
contract
that
says
that
you
can
use
seniority
to
come
back
from
a
strike.
the
seniority
analysis
is
completely
false
in
this
situation.
what
these
people
did,
the
crossovers
did,
was
to
take
the
vacancies
that
existed
during
the
strike.
they
took
the
jobs,
and
there
was
no
question
of
a
reassignment
or
realignment
of
jobs
after
the
strike.
there
was
no
need
to
assess
a
pool
of
applicants,
and
determine
on
what
basis
to
give
them
or
not
give
them
jobs.
the
strikers
who
remained
out
by
their
own
choice
for
the
full
term
of
the
strike
had
lost
their
jobs
because
their
jobs
were
filled.
if...
there
is
no
question,
for
example,
that
if
the
court
should
announce
such
a
rule
as
the
union
is
arguing
for,
then
perhaps
in
the
next
strike
the
crossover,
the
man
who
wants
to
exercise...
or
woman...
who
wants
to
exercise
his
right
not
to
strike
will
simply
resign
his
job
and
come
back
to
work
as
a
new
hire.
now,
that
is
something
that
laidlaw
says
is
an
unfair
labor
practice,
to
force
a
crossover
to
come
back
as
a
temporary
employee
or
to
give
up
his
seniority
rights
when
he
comes
back,
and
yet
that's
what
the
union
says
has
to
happen
in
this
case.
anybody
who
wants
not
to
strike
must
give
up
his
seniority
rights
and
all
that
he's
earned
during
the
time
that
he's
been
employed,
and
come
back
as
a
new
employee.
then
he's
unassailable...
then
the
union
can't
use
their
so-called
seniority.
they
can't
use
it
anyhow,
because
it
doesn't
apply
in
this
situation,
and
there
is
no
discrimination
analysis
applicable
either,
because
as
this
court
has
said,
in
mackay,
with
respect
to
new
hires,
discrimination
does
not
apply.
thank
you.
