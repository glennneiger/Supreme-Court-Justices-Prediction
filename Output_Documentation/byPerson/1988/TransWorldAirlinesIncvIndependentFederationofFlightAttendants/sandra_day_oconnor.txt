justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit.
in
may
of
1986,
a
strike
of
transworld
airlines
by
its
flight
attendants,
organized
under
the
independent
federation
of
flight
attendants,
ended
up
with
the
attendants'
unconditional
offer
to
return
to
work.
at
the
time
of
that
offer,
twa
had
filled
many
of
the
vacancies
created
by
the
strike
with
newly
hired
personnel
and
with
flight
attendants
who
had
either
not
gone
out
on
strike
or
who
had
returned
to
work
before
the
conclusion
of
the
strike.
twa
refuse
to
displace
any
of
these
flight
attendants
to
make
room
for
more
senior
flight
attendants
who
wanted
to
return
to
work
once
the
strike
had
ended,
and
court
litigation
ensued.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
twa
was
required
to
displace
those
flight
attendants
who
did
not
strike
or
who
returned
to
work
before
the
strike's
conclusion
in
order
to
make
room
for
more
senior
striking
flight
attendants.
we
reverse
that
judgment
in
the
opinion
filed
today,
and
thereby
reinstate
the
decision
of
the
district
court
that
neither
newly
hired
flight
attendants
nor
junior
non-striking
flight
attendants
need
be
displaced
at
the
conclusion
of
the
strike
to
permit
more
senior
flight
attendants
to
return
to
work.
our
decision,
as
explained
in
the
opinion,
rest
on
our
understanding
of
the
railway
labor
act,
the
statute
which
governs
labor
management
relations
in
the
airline
industry,
and
its
close
relative,
the
national
labor
relations
act.
we
hold
today
that
twa's
decision
to
replace
senior
striking
employees
with
junior
non-striking
employees
and
its
refusal
to
displace
them
at
the
conclusion
of
the
strike
was
an
exercise
of
twa's
peaceful
economic
power
that
it
was
legally
free
to
deploy.
once
labor
and
management
had
exhausted
the
private
dispute
resolution
mechanisms
of
the
railway
labor
act.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
marshall
has
joined.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
parts
one
and
two
of
which
justice
brennan
has
joined.
