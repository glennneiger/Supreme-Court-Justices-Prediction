mr.
john
p.
hurley
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
first
like
to
try
to
set
a
couple
of
things
straight,
based
on
what
i
heard
on
the
other
side
here
this
afternoon.
first
of
all,
we
are
not
attempting
to
claim
that
under
the
rla,
the
right
to
strike
should
have
a
greater
protection
than
it
does
under
the
nlra.
we
are...
neither
are
we
necessarily
disowning,
as
the
solicitor
general
put
it,
nlra
precedent
that
the
eighth
circuit
utilized
in
its
decision
in
finding
that
twa
violated
the
rla.
for,
as
this
court
knows,
nlra
precedent,
especially
in
an
area
where
under
the
rla
case
authority
has
not
sufficiently
developed,
can
be
quite
useful,
can
be
conceptually
useful
as
long
as
careful
analogies
are
drawn.
and
i
think
it
bears
repeating
that
the
nlra
precedent
utilized
by
the
lower
court,
in
our
opinion,
was
right
on
point,
especially
the
case
of
erie
resistor
and
the
parallels
that
the
lower
court
drew
from
this
court's
decision
in
that
particular
case.
now,
having
said
that,
we
readily
acknowledge
that
the
rla
does
not
contain
express
limitations
in
the
act
concerning
the
parties'
use
of
self-help
measures.
but
this
court
has
held
that
the
parties'
use
of
self-help
is
not
totally
unlimited.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
jacksonville
terminal
decision,
this
court
held
that
while
the
parties
may
utilize
the
full
measure
of
peaceful
economic
action
as
self-help,
it
cannot
do
os
if
that
self-help
conflicts
with
any
other
statutory
obligation.
mr.
john
p.
hurley
well,
i--
mr.
john
p.
hurley
--i'm
sorry.
if
i
said
florida
east
coast,
i
misspoke.
i
was
talking
about
jacksonville
terminal,
as
far
as
the
court's
holding
that
as
long
as
the
self-help
measures
do
not
conflict
with
any
other
statutory
obligation.
florida
east
coast
i
will
later
visit,
but
i
misspoke.
now,
one
of
these
statutory
obligations,
we
maintain,
and
apparently
we
have
a
very
fundamental
disagreement
with
counsel
for
twa...
one
of
these
statutory
obligations,
we
maintain,
is
the
right
to
strike.
it
is
protected
under
the
rla,
and
under
section
2
fourth
this
court
again,
in
jacksonville
terminal,
made
it
quite
clear
that
the
employees'
right
to
strike
is
a
core
rla
right.
it
is
integral
to
the
act.
in
fact,
other
courts
have
described
the
right
to
strike
in
an
rla
context
as
it
has
in
the
nlra...
one
of
the
union's
more
cherished
weapons.
so,
we
maintain
that
there
can
be
no
question
of
the
obligation
under
section
2
fourth
on
the
part
of
a
carrier
to
avoid
influencing
or
coercing
the
employees'
right
to
strike
through
the
use
of
self-help
measures.
mr.
john
p.
hurley
well,
hiring
permanent
replacements
is
an
exception
to
the
statutory
rule
under
2
fourth,
as
it
is
under
the
nlra
section
883.
it
has
been
deemed--
mr.
john
p.
hurley
--because
when
this
court,
in
mackay,
balanced
the
two
conflicting
rights,
it
deemed...
and
i
would
parenthetically
note,
indicted,
in
that
case...
it
nevertheless
deemed
that
the
right
of
the
employer
to
operate
its
business
by
hiring
new
hire
replacements--
mr.
john
p.
hurley
--at
the
conclusion
of
the
strike,
yes,
justice--
mr.
john
p.
hurley
--because
we
have
a
different
set
of
factual
circumstances.
mr.
john
p.
hurley
i
think
the
employer's
right
to
run
his
business--
mr.
john
p.
hurley
--but
i
think
it
has
to
be
carefully
balanced,
against
the
expressed
statutory
right
that
employees
have
to
be
free
from
employer
retaliation
when
it
engages
in
one
of
the
critical
aspects
of
union--
mr.
john
p.
hurley
--that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
have
no
quarrel
with
the
balance
at
this
point
that
this
court
drew
in
mackay.
we're
not
talking
about
the
right
of
the
permanent
new-hire
replacements
to
have
and
keep
jobs
at
the
conclusion
of
the
strike.
mr.
john
p.
hurley
i
disagree
with
that
assessment,
and
i've
looked
at
the
facts
as
carefully
as
i
can
in
mackay.
it's
not
particularly
clear
when
you
read
both
the
board's
decision
in
the
original
mackay
case
and
this
court's
decision,
exactly
what
the
facts
were.
but
if
i
could
quote
in
the
nlrb's
erie
resistor
decision,
which
this
court
approved,
it
interpreted...
the
board
interpreted...
mackay
as
follows:
"an
employer
during
an
economic
strike,
is
permitted
to
secure
new
employees
or
employees
outside
the
bargaining
unit
to
work
permanently
at
unit
jobs.
"
"in
mackay's
case,
these
were
employees
outside
of
the
bargaining
unit.
"
"they
were
not
employees
in
the
particular
striking
workforce
that
they
were
brought
in
to
replace.
"
mr.
john
p.
hurley
they
were
employees
at
other
far
reaching
locations.
mr.
john
p.
hurley
there
were
crossovers
involved.
mr.
john
p.
hurley
yes,
they
were.
this
issue--
mr.
john
p.
hurley
--that's
correct,
justice--
mr.
john
p.
hurley
--well,
that
issue
is
not
before
the
court
in
erie
resistor.
mr.
john
p.
hurley
the
issue
of
super-seniority
and
the
devastating
effect
that
that
particular
benefit
that
was
promised
to
the
crossovers
was
at
issue.
mr.
john
p.
hurley
that's
correct.
if
it
had
been
raised,
that's
what
the
counsel
for
the
union,
i
think,
would
have
been
arguing.
but
it
was
not
raised.
now,
i
think
it's
clear--
mr.
john
p.
hurley
--i
wish
that
it
had,
your
honor,
but
it
had
not.
it
did
not.
[laughter]
mr.
john
p.
hurley
hiring
a
new
hire?
mr.
john
p.
hurley
because
i
think
in
the
latter
case,
the
case,
the
question
we're
arguing,
where
promises
are
made
to
crossovers
who
are
members
of
the
pre-strike
working
force
and
the
striking
community...
those
promises
unlike
the
promise
of
permanence
to
the
new
hires,
an
outside
group...
those
promises
to
the
crossovers,
they
impact
upon
the
striking
group
seeking
to
divide
that
group
and
to
create
individual
competition
among
the
striking
group,
to
abandon
the
strike.
mr.
john
p.
hurley
well,
the
result
of
promising
that
they
would
be
able
to
retain
their
jobs
in
the
post-strike
workforce,
that
result
is
that
when
full-term
strikers
who
exercise
their
right
to
fully
engage
in
strikes
ask
for
reinstatement,
they
are
denied
that
reinstatement
because
of
the
previous...
what
we
maintain...
illegal
promises
made
to
these
crossovers
by
the
employers.
mr.
john
p.
hurley
yes.
there
is
an
individual
right
that
employees
have
under
both
acts
to
refrain
from
engaging
in
union
activities.
mr.
john
p.
hurley
no,
i
don't
think
the
arguments
that
we
make
infringes
upon
the
individual
right
to
refrain,
because
number
one,
the
employee
is
free
to
refrain
from
striking
at
any
time
and
return
to
his
or
her
job
and
earn
his
or
her
livelihood
during
the
pendency
of
the
strike.
and
if
he
or
she
has
sufficient
seniority
or
whatever
neutral
basis
the
employer
should
use,
that
person
may
very
well
remain
in
the
active
workforce
after
the
strike.
mr.
john
p.
hurley
that
is
one
of
the
risks.
mr.
john
p.
hurley
well,
because,
to
put
the
shoe
on
the
other
foot,
if
the
employer
is
also
telling
those
who
want
to
exercise
fully
their
right
to
strike
that
they
will
most
likely
not
only
be
replaced
by
permanent,
new
hire
replacements,
but
also
by
early
returning
strikers
because
they
chose
to
show
fealty
to
the
company
at
an
earlier
point,
that
they
will
not
be
allowed
to
keep
their
jobs,
is
blatant
discrimination
for
engaging
in
union
activities.
and
so
this
balancing
has
to
occur,
and
we
argue
in
this
case
that
the
violation
is
because
twa
did
not
use
a
neutral
basis
in
determining,
in
distributing
the
post-strike
active
workforce
jobs,
beyond
those
in
which
permanent
new
hire
replacements
were
in,
and
could
not
be
displaced.
and
we
argue
that
seniority
as
the
lower
court
used,
was
the
most
appropriate
neutral
basis
that
they
could
have
utilized.
twa
did
not
do
so,
and
indeed
trumpeted
the
fact
even
before
the
strike
began
that
they
were
not
going
to
use
any
neutral
basis,
or
continue
to
use
the
seniority
system.
they
announced
early
that
they
were
going
to
use
a
system
that
would
favor
the
early
abandonment
of
the
strike.
if
you
did
not
go
in
and
get
your
job
early,
you
might
risk
the
chance
of
losing
it
for
engaging
in
the
strike
full-term.
so,
we
really
feel
that
the
real
question
here
is
not
whether
this
activity,
this
conduct
on
the
part
of
twa
is
coercive,
as
we
clearly
think
it
is,
but
whether
there
is
any
reason
that
this
type
of
coercion
should
be
somehow
privileged
under
the
rla
as
the
hiring
of
new
hire
replacements
under
the
mackay
rule
would
appear
to
be
under
the
rla.
mr.
john
p.
hurley
yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
john
p.
hurley
yes,
absolutely.
mr.
john
p.
hurley
based
upon
the
application
of
seniority?
mr.
john
p.
hurley
the
numbers
were
not
gone
into
during
the
litigation,
in
terms
of
the
breakdown.
it's
difficult
for
me
to
speculate,
although
i
would
represent
that
there
would
be
a
significant
number
of
crossovers,
not
an
insignificant
number,
at
least,
that
would
have
remained,
based
upon
their
seniority
standing.
mr.
john
p.
hurley
well,
under
the
theory
that
we
argue,
and
which
the
lower
court
upheld,
i
was
answering
your
question.
mr.
john
p.
hurley
but
there
would
be
a
significant
number
of
crossovers
that
would
not
have
been
displaced.
mr.
john
p.
hurley
as
i
said
earlier,
i
think
that
the...
unlike
under
the
nlr,
where
the
nlrb
balances
these
conflicting
interests,
the
federal
courts
are
called
upon,
under
the
rla,
to
engage
in
this
balancing.
and
i
think
one
has
to
not
only
refer
to
nlra
precedent,
as
i
previously
mentioned,
in
this
balancing
process,
but
one
has
to
refer
to
the
florida
east
coast
case,
that
i
earlier
had
misspoken
about.
the
florida
east
coast
case
provides
a
conceptual
backdrop
for
our
argument.
the
florida
east
coast
decision
illustrated
the
strong
congressional
concern
that
congress
had
for
labor
stability
under
the
rla.
it
clearly
emphasized
in
regard
to
this
labor
stability
concern
that
it
was
served
by
certain
continuity
factors...
continuity
of
the
existing
rules
governing
the
striking
community
that
had
not
been
previously
placed
in
the
act's
bargaining
processes,
which
is
the
twa
1
case
earlier
argued;
continuity
of
the
employer/employee
relationship,
of
seeking
to
avoid
mass
turnover
of
the
experienced
employees,
even
during
a
work
stoppage.
mr.
john
p.
hurley
during
the
strike,
if
they
offered
to
come
back,
if
they
are...
if
the
employer
would
be
refusing
to
allow
the
crossover
to
come
back
to
work
for
his
union
activities,
then
i
think
that
would
be
a
violation.
mr.
john
p.
hurley
i'm
not
certain
under
those
circumstances,
justice
white,
whether
that
would
be
necessarily
a
violation.
i
can't
conceive
that
the
employer
would
not
take
crossovers
back
on
the
basis
that
they
should,
that
the
reinstatement
of
these
crossovers
to
jobs
may
be
subject
to
defeasance,
namely
if
the
crossover's
seniority
or
any
other
basis
that
is
fair,
say,
would
not
hold
that
person's
position.
mr.
john
p.
hurley
i
certainly
think
that's
what
we're
arguing
for.
mr.
john
p.
hurley
i
think
so.
i
think
that
could
be
made
clear,
that
when
a
crossover
comes
back,
he
has
no
guarantees
but
rather
may
be
subject
to
displacement
based
on
some
neutral
basis
that
the
employer
is
going
to
utilize,
and
i
certainly
think
seniority
would
be
one
of
those.
mr.
john
p.
hurley
that
would
depend
upon
whether
there
were
any
permanent
replacements,
new
hire
permanent
replacements
hired.
mr.
john
p.
hurley
and
essentially
that's
true,
because
in
most
industrial
situations,
most
plants
or
whatever,
especially
having
collective
bargaining
agreements,
when
there
are
not
enough
jobs
to
go
around,
usually
collective
bargaining
agreements
provide
for
seniority
to
determine
who
gets
the
available
job,
and
not
any
basis
such
as
what
twa
used.
in
that
vivid
example
that
you
put
forth,
i
think
that
basically
the
senior
striker
is
saying
"i'm
not
going
to
be
penalized
merely
because
you
go
in
early
to
take
my
job,
while
i
stay
out
on
the
picket
line
and
engage
in
my
right
to
strike.
"
mr.
john
p.
hurley
i
disagree
with
that,
justice
scalia.
mr.
john
p.
hurley
i
don't
know
of
too
many
strikers
who
would
urge
their
fellow
pre-strike
workforce
employers
to
go
back
in.
after
all,
striking
is
a
part
of
economic
warfare.
the
union
is
trying
to
put
as
much
pressure
on
the
employer
as
it
can,
and
vice
versa.
the
employer
by
trying
to
operate
his
business--
mr.
john
p.
hurley
--well,
i
think
that
we
are
not
saying
that
there
is
no
case,
especially
under
the
rla,
in
which
a
carrier
cannot,
in
accordance
with
the
dictates
of
the
florida
east
coast
decision,
cannot
demonstrate
that
there
is
a
real
need
to
offer
permanence
to
crossovers,
because
perhaps
they
are
not
able
to
get
new
hire
replacements
in
order
to
operate.
mr.
john
p.
hurley
well,
i'm
not
so
sure--
mr.
john
p.
hurley
--i'm
not
so
sure
that
i
would
characterize
it
in
those
words,
mr.
chief
justice.
[laughter]
i
think
it
provides
a
very
clear
conceptual
framework
for
the
rla.
mr.
john
p.
hurley
well,
and
as
you
know,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
involved
the
description
of
how
important
it
was,
even
during
the
temporary
interruption
of
a
strike,
for
all
of
these
continuity
concerns
to--
mr.
john
p.
hurley
--i
understand.
i
simply
think
that
it
cannot
be
read
so
narrowly
that
florida
east
coast
then
becomes
just
a
decision
based
on
its
own
facts.
i
think
it
clearly
indicates
that
under
the
rla,
there
are
very
legitimate
concerns
that
congress
had
with
keeping
this
stability.
mr.
john
p.
hurley
well,
i
think
that
under
florida
east
coast
if
the
carrier
can
demonstrate
that
there
is
a
need
for
giving
crossovers--
mr.
john
p.
hurley
--i
think
that
a
carrier
can
go
in
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
strike
and
seek
a
district
court,
a
federal
district
court
permission
to
make
these
type
of
promises
that
are
challenged
in
this
case.
i
don't
think
there
necessarily
has
to
be
lengthy
litigation
over
something
like
xx--
there
may
well
be,
but
otherwise
i
don't
know
how
to
read
florida
east
coast
any
other
way
than
that
there
was
this
concern
that
there
would
be
no
alteration
of
the
existing
rules
governing
the
striking
community
other
than
those
submitted
to
the
bargaining
process.
i
might
mention,
as
we
did
in
our
brief,
that
while
this
question
before
the
court
does
not
challenge
mackay
under
either
the
rla
or
the
nlra,
we
have
a
separate
count
in
the
lawsuit
that
the
union
originally
started
this
action
with,
that
does
call
into
question
whether
the
mackay
rule
is
nevertheless
an
absolute
rule...
where
it
is
an
irrebuttable
presumption
in
all
cases.
we
intend
to
convince
the
court
that
even
under
mackay,
in
an
rla
context,
there
may
be
situations
in
which
the
union
having
the
burden
of
proof
can
demonstrate
there
was
not
a
reasonably
necessary...
there
was
not
a
need,
reasonably
founded
on
fact,
to--
mr.
john
p.
hurley
--we're
going
to
try
to
convince
the
district
court
that
it
is
pending
before,
and
if
necessary,
certainly,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
will
take
it
as
far
as
we
need
to.
[laughter]
we
believe
that
this
court
has
never
held
that
the
mackay
rule
is
such
an
absolute
rule,
and
that
that
is
an
open
question,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
before
this
court,
even
though
in
a
case
called
hot
shoppes,
the
national
labor
relations
board
appears
to
have
indicated
in
their
thinking
that
you
can
replace
strikers
with
new
hires
at
will...
absolutely.
we
disagree
under
the
rla.
now,
i
would
like
to
also
address
briefly
the
notion
that
counsel
for
twa
and
the
board
raises
concerning
the
fact
that
there
seems
to
be
some
sort
of
anomalous
result
created
by
the
ruling
below.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
what
we
urge
here...
what
we
argue
for...
is
the
application
of
one
standard
approach,
or
analysis,
but
to
diverse
circumstances,
two
entirely
different
sets
of
circumstances.
we
are
talking
about
the
promises
made
to
crossovers
which
involve
different
factual
matters,
and
which
call
for
a
different,
but
certainly
not
an
anomalous,
result.
even
the
nlrb
recognizes
certain
fundamental
distinctions
under
the
nlra
in
the
way
an
employer
can
treat
new
hire
permanent
replacements
during
a
strike
versus
its
treatment
of
crossovers
who
cross
over
and
also
work
during
a
strike.
the
nlrb
has
held
that
an
employer
can
unilaterally
alter
conditions
pertaining
to
the
new
hire
replacements
and
does
not
commit
an
unfair
labor
practice,
but
cannot
do
so
with
respect
to
crossovers,
where
the
board
finds
that
the
crossovers
have
a
community
of
interest
with
the
pre-strike
workforce.
mr.
john
p.
hurley
i
don't
read
it
as
that.
mr.
john
p.
hurley
i
think
the
result
is
that
the
board
says
that
crossovers
must
be
treated
under
the
terms
that
exist
even
throughout
the
strike
that
were
established
in
the
previous
collective
bargaining
agreement...
that
no
alternations
can
be
made
in
those
terms
as
they
apply
to
working
crossovers
unless
they
are
bargained
about
with
the
crossovers'
collective
bargaining
rep.
mr.
john
p.
hurley
during
the
strike,
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
say
that
the
mackay
rule
created
an
apparently
permissible
division
or
conflict
between
a
group
of
outside
workers,
outside
people,
and
the
striking
workforce
as
a
whole,
in
competition
for
post-strike
jobs.
the
balance
tipped
in
that
instance
in
favor
of
the
employer
for
the
reasons
i've
already
spoke.
but
the
decision
below
recognized
that
mackay
was
not
intended
to
allow
the
employer
to
also
create,
or
in
addition
create
a
division
among
the
striking
workforce,
and
that's
where
they
analyzed
and
applied
the
principles
in
erie
resistor,
and
we
think
correctly.
in
the
post-strike
distribution
of
jobs
in
the
active
workforce,
the
employer
has
to
use
a
neutral
basis,
a
non-discriminatory
basis,
and
that's
exactly
what
twa
did
not
do
here.
under
the
decision
below,
the
result
is
that
neither
the
crossovers
nor
the
full-time
strikers
are
totally
shut
out
of
post-strike
jobs
in
the
active
workforce.
some
crossovers
will
be
prevented
from
having
an
active
job
at
the
immediate
conclusion
of
the
strike,
but
so
will
many
full-term
strikers.
if
seniority
is
used,
it
will
depend
upon
seniority
and
not
how
long
you
stayed
out
on
strike
versus
how
soon
you
came
back
in.
now,
also
implicit,
it
seems
to
me,
in
both
the
board
and
twa's
argument
against
the
eighth
circuit's
decision
is
the
fact
that
they
argue
there
are
no
vacancies
available.
the
crossovers
are
filling
those
vacancies.
therefore,
how
can
there
be
discrimination
when
the
employer
simply
says,
"i'm
sorry,
there
are
no
vacancies,
and
we
can't
reinstate
you
until
there
are
some?
"
to
the
union,
that
is
a
circular
argument.
it
is
begging
the
essential
question,
namely,
whether
or
not
the
employer
can
make
the
initial
promise
that
he
seeks
to
keep
at
the
end
of
the
strike,
the
initial
promise
that
these
crossovers
can
remain
in
the
post-strike
workforce
no
matter
what.
no
matter
seniority
or
any
other
neutral
basis.
we
feel
that
this
is
a
result-oriented
argument
and
should
be
rejected.
even
if
an
employer
does
not,
in
fact,
make
promise
of
permanency
to
either
new
hires
or
crossovers,
especially
with
respect
to
crossovers,
then
the
law
is
clear
that
he
cannot
refuse
to
reinstate
full-term
strikers
at
that
point,
at
the
end
of
the
strike.
he
has
to
make
the
promise
of
permanency
to
the
new
hires
to
create
the
legitimate
substantial
business
purpose
that
fleetwood
recognized.
