mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
kennedy,
i'd
like
to
begin
by
addressing
the
question
that
you
were
asking
at
the
outset
to
my
co-counsel.
the
fact
is
that
although
the
statute
does
plainly
create
a
right
in
the
crossovers
to
return
to
their
job,
a
right
that
we
think
is
fairly
entailed
by
this
court's
decision
in
fleetwood
and
in
the
board's
decision
in
laidlaw,
that
right,
like
many
other
rights,
are
waivable,
and
it
is
waivable
by
virtue
of
the
union's
duty
to
represent
all
employees,
crossovers,
full
time
strikers
alike.
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
the
form
in
which
the
waiver
takes
place,
and
if
the
waiver
is
articulated
in
that
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
crossovers
have
no
claim,
unless
it's
a
claim
against
their
union
for
a
breach
of
their
duty
to
represent
all
employees
fairly
and
equitably.
but
the
mere
fact
that
an
agreement,
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
can
waive
that
right
does
not
mean
that
there's
no
underlying
right
to
be
waived,
and
it's
our
position
that
indeed
there
is.
there's
no
inconsistency.
i
think
this
point
is
fairly
implicit
in
this
court's
decision
in
belknap,
and
in
particular
footnote
8
of
belknap.
and
the
board
has
recognized
in
some
of
its
decisions
that
this
is
a
right
that's
waivable,
and
yet
the
right
exists.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
believe
that
the
only
circumstances
that
i
know
of,
or
that
the
employer
may
displace
the
crossovers
if
he
agrees
to
do
so
by
collective
bargaining
agreement,
or
alternatively...
and
this
is
of
course
not
this
case...
if
the
strike
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
strike,
in
which
case
the
unfair
labor
practice
strikers
have
a
right
of
reinstatement
and
a
right
to
bump
the
crossovers
or
the
new...
and
the
new
hires,
notwithstanding
the
mackay
decision.
we
are
here
today
on
behalf
of
the
labor
board
because
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit,
although
this
case
arises
under
the
railway
labor
act,
decided
it
under
principles
established
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
now,
respondents
may
well
be
correct
to
disown
that
basis
for
the
decision,
but
assuming
that
the
nlra
principles
do
apply,
it
is
the
labor
board's
view
that
the
court
of
appeals
applied
that
statute
in
an
odd
and
untenable
way.
in
this
court's
mackay
decision,
and
for
50
years
since,
two
propositions
have
been
firmly
settled
under
the
nlra.
first,
an
employer
is
entitled
to
hire
replacements
for
economics
strikers
and
to
offer
them
permanent
status.
second,
the
employer
is
not
obligated
to
dismiss
those
replacements
at
the
end
of
the
strike
by
bumping
them,
as
it
were,
in
favor
of
strikers
who
wish
to
return.
rather,
as
the
mackay
case
makes
clear,
an
employer
need
only
reinstate...
and
i'm
quoting...
"so
many
of
the
strikers
as
there
were
vacant
places
to
be
filled.
"
in
our
view,
the
court
of
appeals
misunderstood
those
principles
by
drawing
a
distinction
for
purposes
of
the
mackay
rule,
between
so-called
crossover
employees
and
new
hires.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
twa
could
indeed
lawfully
replace
the
strikers
with
new
hires,
but
that
it
could
not
do
so
in
the
case
of
the
crossover
employees,
who
in
the
court's
view
had
to
be
discharged
to
make
room
for
the
returning
full-time
strikers.
we
believe
that
distinction
cannot
be
squared
with
the
mackay
decision.
certainly
it
finds
no
basis
in
the
facts
of
mackay,
because
in
mackay,
after
all,
the
strikers
in
that
case
were
replaced
by
other
company
employees
who
were
based
in
other
company
offices,
at
a
time
when
the
entire
workforce
of
the
company
was
supposed
to
be
on
strike.
and
it's
fair
to
say,
therefore,
that
mackay
itself
dealt
with
crossovers,
yet
there's
no
intimation
in
this
court's
opinion
in
mackay
that
that
fact
made
any
difference
at
all.
nor,
we
think,
does
the
court
of
appeals'
distinction
find
any
basis
in
the
purpose
of
the
mackay
ruling.
the
mackay
rule,
as
the
court
said
in
the
decision,
is
based
on
the
employer's
"right
to
protect
and
continue
his
business
by
supplying
places
left
vacant
by
strikers.
"
that
purpose,
we
suggest,
does
not
justify
drawing
the
distinction
that
the
court
of
appeals
drew.
an
employer
may
well
need
to
draw
on
both
sources
of
employees
to
run
his
business
during
an
economic
strike.
indeed,
in
an
industry
like
the
airline
industry,
which
is
of
course
safety
sensitive
and
effected
with
an
important
public
purpose,
it's
rather
odd
to
suppose
that
the
employer
is
relegated
only
to
replace
the
strikers
with
new
hires...
people
who've
never
worked
in
the
industry
before,
perhaps,
instead
of
making
use
of
the
experienced
pre-strike
workers
who
either
stayed
on
the
job
or
returned
early.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
based
its
decision
not
on
these
principles,
but
on
a
notion
of
discrimination.
it
viewed
the
decision
of
twa
as
in
effect
a
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
union
activity.
that
thesis,
we
believe,
makes
no
sense
once
you
recognize
that
mackay
itself
involved
the
same
kind
of
discrimination...
a
discrimination
in
favor
of
new
hires
who
were
replacing
the
full-term
strikers.
and
it's
impossible
to
see
how
the
court
of
appeals
decision
would
not
equally
apply
to
the
decision
to
replace
the
full-term
strikers
with
new
hires.
so,
too,
in
that
case,
could
it
be
said
that
that
is
a
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
union
activity,
but
no
one,
not
the
respondents
nor
the
court
of
appeals
is
pressing
that
proposition
on
this
court
today.
the
court
of
appeals
anchored
its
decision
in
erie
resistor,
but
we
believe
the
analogy
cannot
hold.
there,
unlike
here,
the
employer
chose
a
novel
and
rather
extreme
form
of,
in
a
sense
a
punishment,
by
awarding
20
years'
of
super-seniority,
which
worked
against
all
strikers,
not
just
those
who
were
replaced
and
had
a
long
term
effect
on
the
workforce,
both
before
and
after
the
strike
was
completed.
what's
more,
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
has
the
anomalous
consequence,
we
believe,
of
treating
crossover
employees
who
may
have
many
years
on
the
job,
more
unfavorably
than
new
hires.
the
new
hires,
the
court
of
appeals
concluded,
were
entitled
to
permanent
status...
the
crossovers
were
not,
despite
the
many
years
they
may
have
had
on
the
job.
we
can
find
no
basis
in
the
mackay
decision
for
that
kind
of
result.
indeed,
the
crossovers
have
a
claim
that
the
new
hires
do
not.
they
have
a
claim
of
right.
they
were
permanent
employees
before
the
strike,
they
are
permanent
employees
after
the
strike,
and
as
we
read
the
fleetwood
decision
and
the
laidlaw
decision
of
the
board
which
followed
on
this
court's
fleetwood
decision,
it
would
have
in
fact
been
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
the
employer
to
have
denied
the
crossover
employees
their
jobs
back,
to
have
deprived
them
of
full-term
status.
and
the
court
of
appeals'
construction
of
the
nlra,
assuming
it
is
indeed
applicable
here,
has
the
curious
feature
of
requiring
the
employer
to
violate
the
law
in
order
to
avoid
this
discrimination
that
is
alleged
to
persist.
we
think
it
makes
no
sense
to
turn
the
statute
so
inside-out
as
to
reach
a
result
of
that
sort.
in
short,
we
believe,
there
is
simply
no
warrant
under
the
nlra
for
ousting
the
crossovers
from
the
permanent
positions
that
they
had
always
enjoyed.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
that's
correct.
they
were
not
ousted
in
favor
of
the
new
hires,
it's
true,
but
they
were
ousted
from
a
job
that
they
had
always
had,
and
in
that
way,
in
effect,
the
burden
of
the
strike
and
the
foreseeable--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--that's
true,
but
a
layoff
affects
all
persons
and
is
a
decision
of
the
employer.
in
this
case,
what
you
have
are
the
foreseeable
consequence
of
other
people's
striking
decisions
being
visited
on
a
group
of
people
who
exercise
their
right
under
the
nlra
not
to
strike.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
no,
we
don't
think
that
it
operates
in
quite
that
way.
they--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--that's
correct,
and
we
believe
that
that
was
their
right
under
the
statute.
the
only
reason
they've
been
ousted
is
because
other
employees,
exercising
their
rights
to
be
sure,
let
the
strike
go
on
long
enough
to
be
replaced
themselves.
now,
at
the
end
of
the
strike,
in
the
absence
of
a
back-to-work
agreement,
they
would
have
the
foreseeable
consequences
of
that
nlra
protected
decision,
be
in
a
sense
reallocated
to
other
employees
who
themselves
were
exercising
their
right
not
to
strike.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
their
claim
is
greater
than
the
new
hires',
because
they
were
employees
protected
under
2(3)
before
the
strike
even
began,
and
their
rights
are
not--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i
think
the
finding
of
the
district
court,
justice
white,
is
that
the
seniority
rights
in
the
contract
did
not
apply
to
pre-strike
reinstatement,
and
therefore
had
no
bearing
on
this
particular
decision.
thank
you.
