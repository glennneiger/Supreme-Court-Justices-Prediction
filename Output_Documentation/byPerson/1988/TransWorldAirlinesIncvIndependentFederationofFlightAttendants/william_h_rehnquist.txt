chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
afternoon
in
no.
87-548,
trans
world
airlines
v.
independent
federation
of
flight
attendants.
mr.
gartner,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gartner,
i
got
the
impression
that
the
eighth
circuit
decision
in
what
you
called
twa
1
depended
more
than
its
decision
in
this
case
did
upon
its
construction
of
the
contract.
am
i
right
or
wrong
on
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
i
remember
that
from
twa
1,
i
think.
but
i
didn't
read
the
eighth
circuit's
opinion
in
this
case
as
putting
that
much
emphasis
on
the
contract.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
gartner.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
robbins.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
robbins.
mr.
hurley,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
just...
you
say
that's
the
holding
of
florida
east
coast?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
said
"held".
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
court
balanced
that
in
mackay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
opponent
says
that
the
people
who
were
used
as
replacements
in
mackay
were
actually
employees
of
the
company,
not
just
people
taken
off
the
street.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
were
employees
of
mackay?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
i
know,
but
on
your
theory,
the
crossovers
in
erie
shouldn't
have
kept
their
jobs
at
all.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
you
say
the
florida
east
coast,
the
dictates
of
the
florida
east
coast
decision,
i
mean,
the
sky
is
the
limit
under
that
thing,
if
you
take
all
the
dicta.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
just
a
creative
circus.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
holding
is
an
extremely
narrow
one,
that
a
court
may,
under
certain
circumstances
in
order
to
prevent
the
shutdown
of
a
railroad
change
some
of
the
terms
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
i've
read
the
opinion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
you...
at
least
mackay
is
a
rule
that
you
know
in
advance
what
you're
doing.
you
can
replace
striking
workers
with,
as
you
say,
new
hires.
but
under
the
situation
you
describe,
if
florida
east
coast
is
the
law,
the
employer
is
never
going
to
know
whether
he
can
replace
a
striking
worker
with
a
crossover,
if
it's
a
little
of
this
and
a
little
of
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it'll
depend
on
an
ultimate
court
ratification
of
whatever
the
employer
did,
or
refusal
to
ratify
it?
you
know,
like
three
or
four
years
later?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
intend
to
convince
us,
or
some
other
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
in
effect
a
holding
that
the
employer
must
treat
crossovers
better
than
new
hires.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but...
but
that's
the
result.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whereas
you
wouldn't
have
to
treat
new
hires
that
favorably?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hurley.
mr.
gartner,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gartner.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
87-548,
transworld
airlines
versus
iffa
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
