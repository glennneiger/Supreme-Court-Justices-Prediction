justice
antonin
scalia
and,
you'd
say,
anyway,
the
state
should
be
more
careful,
and
shouldn't,
shouldn't
permit
things
to
be
stolen,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
that's
not
really
very
satisfying.
i
mean,
let's
take
the
troop
sailing
example.
you
know,
the
classic
example
of
restricting
a
paper
from
publishing
the
date
an
which
a
troop
ship
is
going
to
sail.
under
your
theory,
the
government
should
be
very
careful
not
to
let
that
information
out,
but
once
it
gets
out,
there's
nothing
it
can
do,
so
long
as
it's
true?
if
it
were
a
false
date
that
they
published,
that
would
be
okay,
then
you
could
stop
that.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
that's
what
this
basically
comes
down
to,
to
how
important
we
think
it
is
to
prevent
a
rape
victim
from
being
killed
by
her
assailant
while
he's,
while
he's
still
out
there
somewhere.
is
that
what
you
want
us
to
decide...
how
important
that
he
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
rahdert,
you
say,
you
know,
part
of
the
solution
is
the
government
can
just
be
more
careful
in
keeping
this
information
confidential.
but
that
wouldn't
stop
your
newspaper
from
going
out
and
finding
out
from
one
of
the
bystanders,
or
from
the
hospital
where
the
woman
was
taken...
who
she
was,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what,
what
would
be
appropriate?
you
could
do
that,
and
publish,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
no
matter
how
much
the
government
tries
to
keep
the
name
of
this
woman
out
of,
out
of
the
press,
you're
saying
you
have
an
absolute
right
to
put
it
in
the
press?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
let's
forget
about...
there
are
other
ways
to
protect
it.
there
aren't
any
other
ways
to
protect
it.
right?
we
can
just
forget
about
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
the
way
you've
been
arguing
it.
i
mean,
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
take
it
out
of
the
public
domain.
i
mean,
something's
in
the
public
domain,
if
it's
public
knowledge
as
opposed
to
something
classified.
that
just
means
that
the
state
won't
release
it.
it
doesn't
take
it
out
of
the
public
domain,
if
the
newspaper
could
go
around
and
find
out
the
name
of
that
victim,
independently,
from
a
neighbor,
or
from
somebody
else.
i
think
you're
confusing
what's
in
the
public
domain,
with
what
is
in
public
records.
i
think
it's,
it
has
to
be
conceded
that
this
was
not
properly
in
public
records,
but
that
isn't
synonymous
with
being
in
the
public
domain.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
begin
with,
even
if
it
were
the
law
that
the
sheriff
could
not
release
her
name,
i
don't
know
that
if
the
sheriff
did
release
it,
the
person
to
whom
he
released
it,
would
be
violating
the
law.
he
might
be,
in
releasing
it.
but
that
doesn't
mean
the
person
to
whom
he
releases
it,
is
violating
the
law.
anymore
than
if
somebody
comes
over
and
hands
me
a
classified
document
that
he's
not
suppose
to
give
me,
and
i
look
at
it.
i
haven't
violated
the
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
then,
it
received,
it
acquired
the
information
legally
as
far
as
it
was
concerned.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let's
talk
about
that.
the
statute
you're
talking
about...
you
speak
as
though
the
statute
prohibits
the
sheriff
from
releasing
it.
it
doesn't.
section
(1)
says,
"the
sheriff
shall
permit
all
records
to
be
given
to
the
public.
"
and
then,
section
(3)(h)
says,
"however,
information
concerning
sexual
battery
is
not
subject
to
that.
"
that
means,
he
need
not
release
it
to
the
public.
there
is
nothing
in
this
section,
119.07,
that
prohibits
him
from
releasing
it
to
the
public.
it
just
says,
he
need
not,
not
that
he
must
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
have
you
got
cases
on
that,
because
it
really
doesn't
read
that
way,
unless
you're
relying
on
some
florida
cases
that
i
don't
know
about
it.
it
clearly
says,
"every
person
who
has
custody
shall
permit
the
records
to
be
inspected.
"
and
then,
(h),
(3)(h)
says,
"however,
sexual
battery,
information
on
sexual
battery
is
exempt
from
the
provisions
of
subsection
one.
"
well,
mr.
eaton,
you
might
rely
on
one
sentence
in
the
district
court
of
appeals
opinion
here,
which
says,
"reaching
the
merits,
we
find
that
the
information
published,
the
rape
victim's
name,
was
of
a
private
nature,
and
not
to
be
published
as
a
matter
of
law.
"
not
in
the
law.
and
they
cite
early--
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
it's
underbreadth.
it's
quite
the
opposite.
justice
antonin
scalia
gee,
there's
really
less
to
this
case
than
meets
the
eye.
i
thought
it
was
a
really
major
constitutional
issue
here.
but
you're
saying
it's
really
just
what
the
jury
found
is
the
only
thing
that's
up.
that
no
matter
whether
the
statute's
good
or
bad,
this
judgment
stands?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
those
suits,
like
this
statute,
extend
only
to
the
press?
i
have
heard
the
press
come
in
and
argue
before
me
on
many
occasions
for
special
privileges.
this
is
the
first
case
where
i
have
been
confronted
with,
with
the
opposite
argument.
that
the
press
is
at
a
disadvantage
compared
to
everybody
else
in
the
world.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
eaton,
it's
always
a
hard
call
as
to
how
important
the
public
interest
is
versus
the
interest
of
the
press,
and
frankly,
i
have
always
thought
that,
that
one
of
the,
one
of
the
disciplines
that
we
impose
upon,
upon
the
majority
before
they
silence
the
press,
is
that
they
have
to
be
willing
to
silence
themselves
as
well.
you
can't
say
the
press
won't
talk
about
troop
ships,
but
the
rest
of
us
can.
it
this
is,
indeed,
that
serious
a
concern,
why
shouldn't
florida's
policy
extend,
not
just
to
the
press,
but
to
anyone.
upsetting
this
woman,
or
dishonoring
this
woman,
or
anything
else
by,
by
circulating
the
fact
that
she
has
been
the
victim
of
a
rape.
why
is
it
just
limited
to
the
press,
and
why
shouldn't
we
say,
if
you
are
really
serious
about
this,
if
it
is
that
serious
an
interest,
you'd
be
willing
to
extend
it
to
yourselves,
and
not
just
pick
on
the
media.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
fine.
they
wouldn't
be,
they
wouldn't
be
held
liable
for
an
invasion
of
privacy,
obviously.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
backyard
gossip
who
tells
50
people
that
don't
have
to
know,
why
isn't
she
as,
just
as
much
guilty
of
harming
this
woman
as
the
press
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
no.
the
statute
certainly
doesn't
cover
it.
the
statute
just
reads,
"the
press",
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
probably
have
an
official
secrets
act
up
there
too,
i
don't
know.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
really
a
different
question.
it's
not
quite
the
same,
whether
there's
a
less
restrictive
alternative.
you
could
have
an
alternative
that
reaches
the
same
speech,
and
not
other
individuals,
that
is
less
restrictive
of
that
particular
individual.
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
the
same
as
overbreadth.
if
that's
all
you're
relaying
on--
