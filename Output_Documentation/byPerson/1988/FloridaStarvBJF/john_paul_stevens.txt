justice
john
paul
stevens
--do
you
think
all
truthful
publications
have
the
same
value?
i
mean,
there's
some
truthful
publications
that
really
aren't
all
that
important,
such
as,
the
name
of
this
person.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
have
to
draw
any
distinction.
i
just
say,
some
information
is
more
important
than
other
information.
and
this
information
isn't
terribly
important.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there's
a
difference,
isn't
there?
in
cox
broadcasting,
the
opinion
of
the
court
noted
in
the
developing
common
law
tort
of
invasion
of
privacy,
there
was
an
exception
for
material
that
came
to
light
during
the
judicial
proceeding.
these
facts
would
not
fall
within
that
exception.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
was
quite
a
point
made
of
that
in
the
opinion,
as
i
remember
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
not,
that's
not
what
i'm
addressing
my
remark
to,
as
to
whether
you
were
covered
like
a
blanket
by
the
cox
case,
and
i
don't
think
you
are,
if
you
read
the
opinion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
on
the
common
law
tort
of
invasion
of
privacy
in
florida.
are
those
cases
non...
are
there
such
cases
that
do
not
rely
on
the
statutory
provision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
cite
the
florida
case
as
you
define
the
tort
in
your
brief.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
there's
no
statute
involved
in
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you...
your
opponent
says
that
you,
in
effect,
waived
the
overbreadth
challenge
in
the
court
below?
