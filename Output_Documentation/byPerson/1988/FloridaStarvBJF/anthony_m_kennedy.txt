what,
what
was
the
legitimate
public
interest
"here"
in
publishing
the
name
of
this
rape
victim?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
one
more
question
on
that
line.
what
about
the
name
and
address
of
the
only
witness
to
a
killing,
when
the
killer's
still
at
large?
could
a
state
have
a
statute
prohibiting
just
that
publication?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
a
state
enact
a
statute
which
prohibits
publishing
the
name
of
a
witness
to
a
murder
when
the
murderer
is
still
at
large?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
a
very
odd
calculus
though,
because
the
harm
comes
from
the
wide
distribution
given
by
the
media.
that's
the
nature
of
the
harm.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
indicate,
you
indicated
in
the
case
before
us,
when
you
started
your
discussion
that
this
statute
doesn't
apply
to
gossip,
or
matter
which
is
unknown
to
the
community
at
large.
it
only
applies
to
the
press.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
problem
is,
is
that
that's
the
only
thing
that
causes
the
injury.
that's
the
only
thing
that
caused
the
invasion
of
this
person's
privacy.
it's
the
only
thing
that
caused
her
trauma.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
not
necessarily
so,
if
there's
a
scienter
requirement.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
a
scienter
requirement
in
this
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
there
is,
then
he
doesn't
have
to
prosecute
himself?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--of
course,
counsel,
the
statute
that
we're
faced
with,
794.03,
goes
much
further.
it
prohibits
the
newspaper
from
publishing
the
information
no
matter
where
it
gets
it.
everybody
in
town
can
know
it,
and
the
only
person
that
can't
talk
about
it
is
the
newspaper
reporter.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
would
be
quite
a
break
with
our
precedence
if
we
were
to
hold
that,
would
it
not?
i
really
know
of
no
precedent,
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
which
puts
on
the
press
a
disability,
forbidding
them
from
publishing
something
that
it
doesn't
put
on
everybody
else;
i.e.
divulging
troop
ship
information.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
would
you
be
willing
to
stipulate
that
we
could
affirm
your
judgment
and
still
hold
this
statute
unconstitutional?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
but
this
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury
on
a
negligence
per
se
theory,
based
on
the
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suggest
the
trial
judge
would
be
very
surprised
by
that
result.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
counsel,
one
question.
suppose
a
woman
is
arrested
for
murder,
and
it
appears
that
five
days
earlier,
she
had
been
the
victim
of
a
rape
by
the
person
she
killed.
could
the
press
publish
that?
