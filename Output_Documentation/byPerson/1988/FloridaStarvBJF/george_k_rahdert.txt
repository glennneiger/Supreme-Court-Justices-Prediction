mr.
george
k.
rahdert
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
challenges
the
constitutionality
of
florida
statute
794.03,
which
imposes
sanctions
of
a
nature
never
sustained
by
this
court.
794.03
is
a
content-based,
categorical
ban
on
the
publication
of
the
name
of
rape
victims
in
the
state
of
florida.
this
statute
imposes
criminal
and
implied
civil
sanctions
for
the
publication
of
true
information
as
applied
here
for
the
publication
of
information
obtained
from
the
public
domain,
which
was
placed
there
by
the
government.
several
aspects
of
this
statute
bear
particular
mention
at
the
outset.
first,
the
statute
applies
solely
to
press
publication
and
to
the
press's
news
sources.
it
does
not
reach
gossip,
or
other
non-media
forms
of
communication
of
the
same
information.
second,
the
statute
imposes
a
blanket
ban
similar
to
the
statutory
approach,
which
this
court,
rejected
in
the
boston
globe
v.
superior
court
case.
the
statute
makes
no
exceptions
for
the
circumstances
of
the
crime,
the
investigation
of
the
crime,
the
prosecution
of
the
crime
for
the
existence
of
prior
publicity,
for
disclosures
of
the
identity
of
victims
in
court,
in
open
court,
or
for
other
information
that
is
already
in
the
public
domain.
significantly,
the
statute
does
not
make
exception
for
voluntary
disclosures.
by
the
strict
terms
of
the
statute,
when
florida
senator
paula
hawkins
spoke
about
personal
experiences
in
this
area,
that
was
contrary
to
the
statute,
and
the
press
reports
were,
as
well.
it
could
even
be
applied
to
harvard
law
professor,
susan
estritch,
writing
for
the
yale
law
journal.
as
written,
the
statute
is
a
sanction
on
pure
speech.
an
analysis
applied
to
a
very
similar
statute
in
cox
broadcasting
v.
cohn.
the
sanction
on
pure
speech
is
underscored
by
the
determination
of
the
florida
first
district
court
of
appeal,
which
ruled
that
the
subject
matter
of
my
client's
publication,
newspaper
publication,
was
not
to
be
published
as
a
matter
of
law.
the
statute
as
applied
in
this
case
imposes
a
civil
cause
of
action,
and
imposes
negligence,
per
se,
for
publishing,
again,
truthful
information,
obtained
by
routine
news
gathering
processes,
and
obtained
from
the
public
domain.
the
implications
arising
from
negligence,
per
se,
are
illustrated
by
this
case.
at
trial,
simply
on
the
proof
of
publication,
the
trial
judge
directed
a
verdict
on
liability
against
the
newspaper,
and
sent
the
case
to
the
jury
on
damages,
including
punitive
damages
on
an
instruction
of
reckless
indifference.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
your
honor,
those
facts
were
not
part
of
his
consideration.
the
argument--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--i'm
sorry.
there
were
some
facts
on
the
record.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
there
were
facts
concerning--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--the
reporter...
there
were
facts
that
the
reporter
got
the
information
in
the
routine
manner,
a
clerk-trainee-type
reporter
was
sent
down
to
the
sheriff's
press
room.
she
transposed
information
that
was
available
in
the
press
room.
it
was
a
press
release
in
an
unmanned
press
room
of
the
sheriff
of,
sheriff's
office
of
duval
county.
that
information
was
in
the
record.
what
was
also
in--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--your
honor,
there
was
indication
that
the
press,
that
this
newspaper,
indeed,
has
a
self-imposed
policy
of
retraining
from
publishing
the
name
of
rape
victims
in
those
cases.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
that
was
very
unclear
from
the
record.
justice
white.
what
the
reporter
trainee,
and
i
must
emphasize,
her
sole
job
was
to
go
down
and
copy
information.
she
did
not
write
the
story.
she
was
not
a
person
who
wrote
stories.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
that
is
in
the
record,
your
honor.
her
sole
job
was
to
go
down
and
copy
what
the
sheriff
had
set
out
in
the
press
room,
and
that's
all
she
did
here.
there
was
some
testimony
about
a
sign,
it
wasn't
even
a
sign,
it
was
a
photocopy
of
some
statute--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--the
suit
is
against
tie
paper.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
it's
not
against
her.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
the
facts
in
the
record
are
that
she
put
the
information,
copied
verbatim,
from
the
press
released
incident
report
in
a
bin
at
the
newspaper,
and
the
newspaper
reporter,
who
typically
writes
up
several
pages,
two
or
three
pages
of
police
report
stories,
transposed
the
information
into
a
story.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
i
think
you
could
probably
imply
knowledge
of
the
law.
there
was
a
very
confusing
passage
of
testimony
from
this
clerk-trainee-type
person,
that
there
was
a
photocopy
on
the
bulletin
board
at
the
sheriff's
office.
and
it
seemed
to
be
a
photocopy
of
a
statute.
it
was
not
established
whether
that
was
placed
on
the
bulletin
board
before
or
after
the
publication.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
if
it
had
been
illegally
obtained,
there
would
be
remedies
for
theft,
and
for
intrusion.
and
we
do
not
suggest
that
those
remedies
should
be
eviscerated.
but
our
position--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--we
would
say
that
the
appropriate
sanctions
would
be
to
address
the
manner
in
which
it
was
illegally
obtained.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
if
the
information,
if
the
information
had
been
illegally
obtained
in
the
sense
that
it
violated
some
statutes,
statutory
scheme,
that
would
follow
the
precedent,
that
would
fit,
essentially,
the
circumstances--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--your
honor,
we
would,
we
would
contend
that
there
would
be
a
first
amendment
right
to
print
information
in
the
hands
of
the
press,
and
that
the--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--if
it
was
stolen
information,
the
act
of
theft
would
be
a,
would
be
inappropriate
and
unusual.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
your
honor,
we--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
the
prohibition
against
publishing
that
information
would
be--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--under
the
law
of
cox
broadcasting
v.
cohn
and
its
progeny,
this
court
has
suggested
that
before
publication
of
truthful
information
can
be
punished,
there
has
to
be
a
state
interest
of
the
highest
order.
and
there
should
be
an
evaluation
of
whether
there
are
less
restrictive
alternatives.
punishing
the
act
of
theft
would
be
a
less
restrictive
alternative.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
we
contend
the
truthful
publication
enjoys
a
higher
level
of
protection.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
your
honor,
of
course,
this
is
not--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--this
is
not
the
tort
of
the
publication
of
private
facts
in
this
case.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
justice
o'connor,
in
smith
v.
daily
mail,
this
court
recognized
that
to
punish
truthful
information
requires
a
state
interest
of
the
highest
order.
and
further,
that
the--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--your
honor,
as
the
tort
is
presently
formulated,
it
does
not
have
a
mechanism,
either
for
evaluating
whether--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--your
honor,
that
question
is
not
reached
by
a
privacy
tort
of
this
nature.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
this
court
has
recognized,
in
cases
like
snepp,
and
going
back
to
near
v.
minnesota,
that
national
secrets
are
matters
of
concern
of
the
highest
order.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
the
distinction
between
a
copyright
violation
and
this,
is
that
a
copyright
violation
such
as
the
nation
case,
does
not
place
a
restriction
on
truthful
publication.
it
places
a
restriction
on
misappropriating
the
form
of
publication.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
there
is
a
distinction,
at
least,
between
speech
and
action.
and
if
there
was
an
action
of
misappropriation,
that
would
escape
from
a,
from
a
defense
of
truth.
it
would
be
excepted
from
a
defense
of
truth.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
the
report--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--there
is
some
evidence
of
that
nature,
but
justice
o'connor,
as
the
court
noted
in
cox
broadcasting
v.
cohn,
the
commission
of
crime
is
a
matter
of
public
concern.
in
that
case--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--the
rationale,
the
rationale
of
the
georgia
supreme
court
coming
up
in
cox
broadcasting,
was
that
there
was
no
public
interest
in
printing
the
name
of
the
identity
of
the
rape
victim.
cox
broadcasting
found,
broadly,
that
there
is
a
public
interest,
that
this
is
publication
in
the
public
interest,
the
commission
of
crime,
and
the
prosecution,
in
fact--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--your
honor,
i
would
have
to
concede
that,
with
respect
to
this
rape
victim,
my
client's
own
self-imposed
policy,
if
it
had
been
applied,
would
have
excluded
that
publication.
but
the
court
has
ruled
more
broadly
on
what
constitutes
public
interest.
in
rankin
v.
mcpherson
and
connick
v.
myers,
the
court
talks
about
public
interest
in
its
content
and
context.
all
commissions
of
serious
crime,
and
government
responses
to
that
crime,
are
matters
of
public
interest.
the,
it
is
a
matter
of
editorial
judgment
to
parse
out
ore
aspect
of
information
in
the
public
interest,
and
prohibit
that
publication
of--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
absolutely,
the
state
has
an
interest.
and
under
the
decisions
of
landmark
and
cox
broadcasting
v.
cohn,
the
state
can
achieve
that
interest
by
a
less
restrictive
means.
by
better
control
of
information
in
its
hands.
here,
it
is
clear.
if
this
victim,
if
the
information
had
been
properly
handled
by
the
duval
county
sheriff's
department,
and
she
did
sue
the
duval
county
sheriff,
this
problem
would
not
have
occurred.
there--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--the
paper
could
be
fined
for
the
tort
of
misappropriation--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--absolutely.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
that's
a
much
less
restrictive
alternative
than
a
statute
which
has
a
broad
categorical
prohibition
on
publication.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
justice
scalia,
under
my
theory,
there
are
a
couple
of
observations.
first
of
all,
the
invasion
of
privacy
tort
wouldn't
really
provide
much
help
in
matters
of
protecting
public
safety,
and
national
security.
but,
once
more,
the
court
has
the
authority
to...
or,
i
should
say,
legislatures
have
the
authority
to
create
rules
where
the
state
interest
is
of
the
highest
order,
and
in
cases
of
national
security,
troop
shipments
in
time
of
war,
that's
recognized
as
a
matter
of--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
i
must
point
out
that
the
record
does
not
sustain
the
implication
that
the
assailant
was
not
brought
to
justice,
or
was
still
out
there.
but,
in
any
event,
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
statute
was
designed
for
that.
it's
not
narrowly
tailored
to
that.
and
my
position
is
that
a
statute
which
broadly
prohibits
speech,
pure
speech,
categorically,
is
an
unconstitutional
statute
that
there
are
less
restrictive
ways
to
address
the
problem.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--again,
there
has
to
be
an
analysis
of
the
less
restrictive
alternatives.
if
you
have
a
situation
like
that,
i
would
submit
that
the
appropriate
place
to
place
the,
the
incentives
for
controlling
that
information
is
with
the
government.
this
statute,
like
others
the
court
has
considered
is,
in
effect,
a
backstop
statute.
if
the
government
does
not
perform
its
function,
you
backstop
it
by
a
statute
which
prohibits
publication,
and
holds
the
press
strictly
liable
for
its
violation.
and
by
a
less
restrictive
analysis...
by
the
landmark
analysis,
where,
in
the
case
of
publications
about
judicial
qualification
commissions,
this
court
has
recognized
that
there
was
a
possibility
that
the
problem
could
have
been
eliminated
through
careful,
internal
procedures.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
i'm
sorry,
justice
kennedy.
could
you
rephrase
your
question?
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
no.
because
there
is
a
less
restrictive
alternative,
and
that
would
be
a
content-based
statute.
that
would
violate
principles
that
editorial
judgments
are
for--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--it
could
also
be
argued
that
the
harm
comes
from
mishandling
that
information
in
the
hands
of
government.
there's,
the
application
of
this
statute--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--that's
correct.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
there's
no
evidence
of
what
the
statutory
purpose
is.
we
can
engage
in
conjecture
as
to
what
it
might
be.
assuming
that
it
is
the
psychological
well-being
of
the
plaintiff,
certainly,
gossip
in
the
community
would
cause
the
same
injury.
if
you--
going
back
to
the
application
of
this
statute
to
impose
negligence,
per
se,
it
sets
up
an
anomaly
when
compared
to
libel
law.
had
the
florida
star
falsely
accused
or
reported
that
b.j.f.
was
raped,
and
she
filed
a
suit
for
libel,
under
this
court's
rule,
she
would
have
to
prove
fault
and
falsity
under
the
recent
hepps
decision.
this
leads
to
the
anomaly
that
truthful
publication,
which
is
presumed
to
have
a
far
higher
value
in
the
marketplace
of
ideas,
is,
indeed,
accorded
less
protection.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
your
honor,
as
a
matter
of...
your
question
presupposes,
or
i
guess,
begs
a
distinction
between
matters
in
the
public
concern,
and
matters
that
are
not
of
public
concern.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
under
the
holding
of
cox
broadcasting
v.
cohn,
the
commission
of
crime
and
the
prosecution
of
crime,
in
essence,
the
government's
response
to
crime,
is
a
matter
of
public
importance.
i
think
that's
a
holding
of
this
court.
cox
broadcasting
corporation
v.
cohn
is
indistinguishable
from
the
case
at
bar,
with
the
exception
that
in
florida
there
was
a
negligence,
per
se
action,
and
georgia
refused
to
imply
a
cause
of
action
from
a
statute,
which
this
court
analyzed
as
being
virtually
identical
to
the
florida
statute.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
your
honor,
that,
that
was
not
a
distinction
that
was
essential
in
the
cox
broadcasting
case.
cox
talked
about
information
in
the
public
domain,
generally,
not
just
court
information.
and
in
smith
v.
daily
mail
and
landmark
communications,
this
court
has
broadened
its
protection
for
truthful
publication,
beyond
truthful
publication
of
matters
which
come
up
in
open
court.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
that's
correct.
and
under
smith
v.
daily
mail
that
would
be
appropriate.
smith
v.
daily
mail--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--routine
news
gathering
is
protected
under--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--i'm
saying
that,
and
i
think
this
court
said
that
in
smith
v.
daily
mail,
that
routine
news
gathering
of
exactly
the--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--i
would
have
to
disagree.
if
the
paper
would
have
to
routinely,
to
set
out
to
find
this
information,
that
would
be
a
different
case
than
what
is
presented
here.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
i'm
arguing
against
the
statute
which
imposes
negligence,
per
se,
and
which
categorically
prohibits
publication.
and
there
may
be
facts
and
circumstances.
i
would
presume
that
there
would
be,
if
a
newspaper
deliberately
set
out
to
obtain
information
that
made
that
information
newsworthy.
there
was
an
identical
statute
at
issue
in
smith
v.
daily
mail,
justice
scalia,
and
the
court,
and
the
identical
news
gathering
process
occurred...
where
the
newspapers
went
out,
interviewed
people,
monitored
the
police
ban
radio,
and
published
the
name
of
a
juvenile
offender,
despite
a
statute
with
the
same
form
of
ban
as
exists
here.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
never
in
the
history
of
this
statute,
dating
back
to
1911,
and
we
did
not
find
one
in
the
two
other
states,
which
maintain
a
statute
of
this
nature,
either
georgia
or
south
carolina.
the
evidence
does,
of
this
record,
shows
that
there
is
a
broad
self-imposed
standard
by
journalism.
but
a
standard
of
journalism,
and
a
standard
of
law
are
two
different
matters.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
i
would
have
to
be
engaging
in
conjecture
off
the
record,
but
i
believe
that's
been
a
standard.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
going
back
to
justice
blackmun's
question.
one
form
of
analysis
which
this
court
has
adopted
as
not
being
definitive,
but
certainly
relevant,
is
to
survey
the
states
to
see
whether
other
states,
whether
the
pattern
of
a
particular
statute
is
uniform,
or
unique.
as
i
have
mentioned,
there
are
only
three
states
in
the
country
which
have
a
statute
like
this.
two
of
those
statutes,
now,
have
been
before
this
court.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
i
would
find
it
odd
if
the
sheriff
of
duval
county
had
chosen
to
prosecute
under
this,
under
these
circumstances.
by
the
terms
of
the
statute,
he
would
have
had
to
prosecute
himself,
because
he
caused
or
allowed
it
to
be
placed
in
the
public
domain.
i
have
to
go
back--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--under--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--it's
not
stated,
but
there
may
be
under
general
criminal.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
i
must
return
to
cox
broadcasting
v.
cohn.
that
case
is
indistinguishable
from
this.
it
was
press
publication
of
the
name
of
a
rape
victim
in
the
face
of
an
identical
statute,
where
the
government
had
put
the
information
in
the
public
domain.
that
the...
the
rationale
of
that
decision,
and
as
it
has
been
applied
in
smith,
in
landmark,
and
oklahoma
publishing
have
not
limited
it
to
those
circumstances.
what
the
court
recognized
in
cox
broadcasting
applies
here.
the
point
we've
been
discussing
on
whether--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--your
honor,
the
court
talked
about--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--the
opinion
noted
a
developing
exception.
there's
also
the
same
kind
of
privilege
for
accurately
reporting
government
records,
which
this
record
was.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
well,
if
you
read
the
opinion,
together
with
the
smith
v.
daily
mail
case,
and
the
landmark
case--
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
--you
can
see
that
cox
did
not
mean
to
restrict
its
ruling
to
information
derived
from
the
government
records.
oklahoma
publishing,
in
characterizing
cox
broadcasting
v.
cohn
talked
of
the
cox
holding
as
pertaining
to
information
placed
on
the
public
domain
by
government.
if
it
please
the
court,
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
thank
you.
i'd
like
to
first
address
briefly
the
question
of
whether
this
case
is
a
common
law
action,
for
invasion
of
privacy.
and
in
answer
to
justice
steven's
question,
cape
publications
v.
bridges,
cited
at
page
40
of
our
brief,
adopts
essentially
the
restatement
of
torts.
section
652(d)
as
to
a
common
law
action.
if
you
compare
the
restatement
with
the
amended
complaint,
which
is
in
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement,
starting
at
appendix
page
seven,
you'll
see
that
none
of
the
elements
of
a
common
law
cause
of
action
for
invasion
of
privacy
are
pleaded
in
this
case,
this
is
simply
not
a
a
common
law
case.
finally,
on
that
point,
at
the
joint
appendix
on
page
30,
and
a
footnote
in
our
brief
on
page
six,
the
ruling
of
the
judge
on
the
plaintiff's
motion
for
directed
verdict
demonstrates
that
the
ruling
in
this
case
was
based
on
794.03.
the
mere
act
of
publication
created
liability.
there
is
no,
none
of
the
protective
measures
developed
in
the
law
of
libel
involving
fault,
and
the
protection
of
truth.
on
the
proposition
that
the
statute
protects
victims
by
prohibiting
publication,
in
the
words
of
this
court
in
boston
globe,
that
proves
too
much.
there's
nothing,
there
is
no
principal
basis
for
limiting
that
type
of
analysis
to
rape
victims.
that
would
be
true
of
all
victims
of
all
crimes
which
are
unsolved,
and
a
ruling
as
that
would
severely
inhibit
the
ability
to
report
on
crime,
which
in
cox
broadcasting
v.
cohn
is
a
matter
of
public
concern.
mr.
eaton
talked
about
various
distinctions
in
this
case.
the
victim
being
dead,
the
assailant
being
at
large.
those
are
not
considerations
under
the
statute,
those
are
not
limiting
factors
under
the
statute,
the
statute
is
broad.
it
doesn't
care
whether
the
victim
is
dead
or
alive,
whether
the
assailant
is
at
large,
whether
the
assailant
has
been
convicted,
or
acquitted
in
fact.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
your
honor,
we
present
the
overbreadth
challenge
as
a
question
under
cox
broadcasting,
under
landmark
of
a
first
amendment
question
of
whether
there
were
less
restrictive
alternatives.
it
was
also
raised
as
overbreadth
at
the
trial
courts
and
in
the
briefing
in
the
first
district
court
of
appeal.
but
the
question
of
whether
less
restrictive
alternatives
exist,
which
is
to
say
whether
the
statute
goes
beyond
the
bounds
necessary
for
protecting
first
amendment
interest
is
the
federal
question.
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
question
has
been
central
throughout
this
case.
mr.
george
k.
rahdert
the
first,
the
first
amendment...
excuse
me,
the
first
amendment
analysis
also
questions
whether
first
amendment
restrictions
are
effective
to
achieve
their
purposes.
and
that,
would
be...
an
enlargement
of
the
first
amendment
argument
would
be
to
the
effect
that
this
statute,
because
it
doesn't
restrict
other
publications,
it
is
confined
to
press
publications,
is
not
effective
in
achieving
the
purpose,
whatever
that
purpose
is.
if
we
don't
have
a
record
of
it.
it
hasn't
been
stated
by
the
state
of
florida.
the
state
of
florida
isn't
here
today.
i
would
like
to
make
one
point
clear
from
my
previous
argument.
we
had
a
colloquy
about
truth
as
a
defense,
and
i
want
to
make
it
quite
clear
that
that
is
an
alternative
basis
for
a
ruling
in
this
case.
i
would
suggest
that
this
decision
is
due
to
be
reversed
on
the
most
limited
grounds
set
forth
in
cox
that
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
do
not
permit
sanctions
for
a
truthful
publication
of
information,
lawfully
obtained
from
the
public
record.
i
agree
with
justice
scalia's
analysis
that,
that
the
chapter
119
of
the
florida
statutes,
creates
a
broad
definition
of
public
records.
