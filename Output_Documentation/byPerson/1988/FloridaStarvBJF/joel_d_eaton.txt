mr.
joel
d.
eaton
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
divide
my
argument
into,
essentially,
two
parts,
which
you're
free
to
interfere
with,
of
course.
but
first,
i
think
i
need
to
distinguish
cox
broadcasting
corp
v.
cohn,
and
after
i
have
done
that,
i
will
turn
to
how
the
conflicting
interest,
privacy
versus
free
press,
ought
to
be
balanced
in
our
view,
to
resolve
the
question.
before
i
reach
either
of
those
subject,
however,
i
need
to
correct
one
thing
that
mr.
rahdert
said.
he
said
that
the
evidence
in
this
case
does
not
reflect
that
the
assailant
had
not
been
apprehended
at
the
time
of
the
publication.
the
article
in
question
here
contains
as
its
last
sentence,
the
following:
"patrol
efforts
have
been
suspended
concerning
this
incident,
because
of
a
lack
of
evidence.
"
that
article
was
in
evidence
at
trial.
b.j.f.
was
asked
at
trial
if
that
article
was
true,
and
she
stated,
"unfortunately,
it
is
true".
so,
the
fact
that
the
assailant
was
still
at
large
at
the
time
of
the
publication
is
proven
on
the
record
in
this
case.
when
the
gut
issue
here,
privacy
versus
free
press,
came
up
to
this
court,
it
was
presented
in
a
somewhat
attenuated
form
in
the
cox
broadcasting
corp.
v.
cohn
case.
this
court
never
reached
the
point
where
it
had
to
balance
those
conflicting
interests,
however,
because
with
the
exception
of
the
chief
justice's
dissent
on
the
jurisdictional
ground,
the
court
unanimously
concluded,
that
because
the
rape
victim's
name
in
the
cox
broadcasting
case
had
already
been
placed
freely
into
the
public
domain
in
connection
with
a
judicial
proceeding,
and
nobody
had
ever
taken
any
steps
to
protect
the
confidentiality
of
that
information,
and,
therefore,
the
victim
had
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
at
that
point,
that
the
newspaper
could
not
be
punished
criminally
or
civilly
or
simply
repeating
in
public,
what
was
already
in
the
public
domain.
and
because
it
reached
that
conclusion,
it
didn't
have
to
go
on
to
balance
the
respective
interests
involved.
to
the
extent
that
there's
any
balancing
suggested
by
cox
broadcasting,
i
need
to
remind
the
court,
as
well,
that
this
is
also
a
different
factual
case
than
cox
broadcasting.
in
cox
broadcasting,
the
victim
was
dead.
her
mental
and
physical
security
did
not
need
to
be
protected
at
that
point.
the
plaintiff
in
cox
broadcasting
corp.,
who
was
asserting
a
privacy
right,
was
the
victim's
father.
he
was
asserting
his
privacy
right;
not
the
victim.
and
the
assailant
had
been
apprehended.
and
the
matter
had
reached
full-blown
judicial
trial
of
this
assailant,
at
which
point,
a
number
of
different
considerations
come
into
play
that
are
involved
in
this
case.
now,
i
argued
below,
and
i
have
argued
here,
that
the
reason
cox
broadcasting
does
not
control
this
case,
is
contrary
to
mr.
rahdert's
suggestion
to
the
court,
b.j.f.'s
name
was
not
in
the
"public
domain"
at
the
time
the
newspaper
obtained
the
information.
florida,
perhaps
in
response
to
this
court's
decision
in
cox
broadcasting
corp.,
enacted
a
statute
called
the
florida
public
records
act,
which
contains
an
exemption.
and
it
says,
"that
the
identity
of
a
rape
victim
on
any
public
record
maintained
by
the
state
of
florida
is
exempt
from
public
disclosure.
"
it
is
confidential.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
well,
i'm
not
inclined
to
argue
with
you,
your
honor,
except
for
the
fact
that
the
lower
courts
have
declared
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
that
this
exception
from
the
public
records
act,
attach
to
the
material,
and
not
merely
to
the
custodian.
the
argument
below
was
that
only
the
state
has
an
obligation
to
follow
this
law,
and
the
newspaper
doesn't.
now,
the
state
courts
rejected
that,
and
in
the
short
opinion
which
is
before
the
court,
it
has
characterized
this
police
report,
which
was
stumbled
on
by
this
reporter
trainee
as
non-public
information.
and
i
think
that
conclusion
is
justifiable
along
the
following
line
of
reasoning.
this
report
was
not
a
press
release.
mr.
rahdert
keeps
calling
it
a
press
release.
it
was
a
copy
of
a
police
report
form.
the
very
document
protected
by
the
confidentiality
laws
of
the
state
of
florida.
one
copy
of
that
report
was
placed
in
a
room
labeled
press
room,
by
mistake,
obviously,
without
redaction
of
b.j.f.'s
name.
that
report,
so
far
as
the
record
in
this
case
reflects,
was
seen
by
no
other
person
except
the
reporter
trainee
in
this
case.
the
reporter
trainee
testified
at
trial.
question,
"you
understood
you
were
not
supposed
to
take
down
the
information
from
the
police
department?
"
answer,
"yes".
if
she
had
followed
what
she
knew
to
be
the
law,
and
the
policy
of
her
own
newspaper,
it
never
would
have
gone
any
farther
than
a
piece
of
paper.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
the
public
records
act
exemption
prevents
the
public
disclosure
of
a
rape
victim's
name
contained
on
a
police
report.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
not
criminally,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
the
argument
is
this,
that
there
is
a
greater
protection
for
the
information
on
this
piece
of
paper,
in
the
form
of
a
state
statute
than
there
is
in
the
judgment
or
the
competence
of
a
clerk
at
the
desk
in
the
police
station.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
i'm
sorry.
we're
talking
about
two
separate
statutes
here.
there
is
a
statutory
scheme.
there
is
an
exemption
to
the
public
records
act,
which
makes
the
information
on
the
police
report
confidential
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
there
is
a
second
statute,
which
also
prohibits
an
instrument
of
mass
communication
from
reporting
the
name
of
a
rape
victim.
i'm
only
talking
now
about
the
first
statute,
the
exemption
from
the
public
records
act,
in
my
effort
to
distinguish
cox--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--no,
your
honor,
and
curiously,
the
criminal
penalty
that
used
to
attach
to
the
custodian
of
that
information
was
recently
removed
by
the
florida
legislature.
and
even
if
a
custodian
turns
that
information
over,
he
can't
be
prosecuted
either,
but
the
point
of
the
law
is--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--i
am
unwilling
to
concede
that,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
i
refer
your
honor
to
the
lower
court's
decision
which
held
that
this
was,
because
of
this
statute,
non-public
information.
my
argument
is
that
the
statute,
which
is
a
state
law,
which
declares
that
piece
of
paper,
and
that
name
confidential,
and
not
to
be
public
disclosed,
publicly
disclosed,
attaches
to
the
material.
which
means
that
both
the
newspaper
and
the
custodian
of
the
document
is
bound
to
respect
the
state
law.
and
the
reason
that
that
is
important,
and
the
reason
why
picking
up
this
place
of
paper
with
knowledge,
actual,
or
reputed,
or
otherwise,
that
this
is
a
confidential
document,
which
you
have
come
into
possession
of
accidentally.
the
reason
that
is
important
is
because,
when
a
rape
victim,
who
is
now
recovering
and
analyzing
whether
she
dare
go
down
to
the
police
station
or
not,
to
report
this
crime,
and
there
is
a
serious
problem
of
underreporting
of
rapes,
wants
to
know
whether
she
has
any
guarantee
of
anonymity.
because
if
she
knows
if
she
reports
this
crimes
the
next
day
in
the
morning's
newspapers
her
name
is
going
to
be
spread
all
over
the
city,
she's
not
apt
to
go.
she
goes
to
the
police
stations
and
she
says,
"what
guarantee
do
i
have
of
anonymity?
"
she
is
informed
the
law
of
florida
is,
that
"your
name
on
our
records
is
confidential,
and
can't
be
published.
"
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
i'm
not
suggesting,
your
honor,
that
the
newspaper
violated
the
florida
public
records
act.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
i
am
suggesting
to
your
honor,
as
the
lower
court's
found,
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
that
the
information
was
non-public
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
i
don't
think
mr.
rahdert
would
agree
with
your
honor
that
that's
a
correct
way
to
read
it,
because
it
is
thoroughly
settled
in
florida
law
that
that
is
a
prohibition.
and
because
it
was
never
drawn
into
issue
here,
we
haven't
argued
it,
and
i
haven't
been--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--and
they
go
on
in
the
last
sentence
to
say,
"because
this
is
non-public
information".
rather
than
bring,
your
honor,
all
the
cases,
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
the
law
of
the
case,
in
this
case,
with
respect
to
the
state
law
question
of
whether
this
information
was
public
or
non-public
is
settled
in
favor
of
non-public
information
by
virtue
of
the
protection
of
that
statute.
now,
that
does
not
answer
the
constitutional
question
here.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
there
is
a
justification
for
that,
as
your
honor
observed
initially.
that
the
damage
is
done
by
mass
circulation;
not
by
this
woman
telling
her
physician,
or
her
boss,
or
her
mother...
those
kind
of
things
are
not
thought
to
be--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--the
problem
is
that
this
is
not
a
suit
brought
on
794.03,
and
you're
talking
about
an
overbreadth
challenge,
which
was
really
never
raised
below,
and
which
i
need
to
come
back
to
to
answer.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
i'm
sorry.
an
under
inclusiveness.
that
was
never
raised
below,
in
any
form,
and
it,
therefore,
hasn't
been
briefed
here.
so,
the
most
that
the
briefs
reflect
here
is.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--i
have
argued
that
you
must
do
that,
because
even
if
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
we
had
a
common
law
action
for
invasion
of
privacy,
and
the
only
way...
a
negligence
action,
in
effect.
the
only--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--in
florida,
when
you
bring
a
negligence
action,
and
the
legislature
has
enacted
a
statute
which
defines
the
minimum
standard
of
care
under
a
given
circumstances...
then
if
the
evidence
is
uncontradicted
as
it
was
in
this
case,
that
the
defendant
violated
the
statute,
the
law
is
that
you
have
been
negligent
as
a
matter
of
law.
and,
therefore,
the
judge
does
not
submit
that
question,
but
the,
to
the
jury
and
he
directs
the
verdict
in
our
favor,
and
that's
what
happened.
but
that
is
a
finding
by
the
judiciary
of
negligent
conduct
in
this
case.
the
only
way
the
statute
came
into
the
case
was
as
a
minimum
standard
of
care.
a
definition,
a
legislative
definition
of
where
your
privacy
rights
are
protected.
and
if
you
throw
the
statute
out
altogether,
we
still
have
a
common
law
action
for
invasion
of
privacy,
without
the
benefit
of
the
statute.
in
which
we
would
have
to
prove
that
no
reasonable
person
would
have
published
this
information;
in
which
we
had
to
prove
reckless
indifference
to
get
an
award
of
punitive
damages.
but
in
this
case
we
proved
reckless
indifference,
and
we
got
an
award
of
punitive
damages.
so,
we
have
a
finding
of
fact
from
a
jury
on
evidence
which
fully
supports
it
according
to
the
state
courts.
that
the
newspaper
was
not
merely
negligent
here,
but
was
recklessly
indifferent.
and,
therefore,
even
if
the
statute
itself
is
unconstitutional,
our
invasion
of
privacy
action
ought
to
survive
on
those
findings
of
fact.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
i
borrowed
that
from
the
chief
justice's
opinion
in
time,
inc.
v.
firestone,
your
honor.
because
there
was
a
discussion
in
that
opinion
about,
if
there
is
a
finding
of
negligence
or
fault,
which
would
support
the
judgment,
even
though
it
may
have
been
reached
for
an
unconstitutional
reason,
we
are
required
to
affirm
a
judgment
on
it--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--well,
i
think,
the
major
constitutional
issue
would
exist
in
any
of
the
50
states
which
recognize
a
common
law
action
for
invasion
of
privacy,
in
which
the
suit
was
brought
against
the
newspaper,
or
any
instrument
of
the
mass
media,
for
the
publication
of
the
name
of
a
rape
victim,
with
or
without
the
benefit
of
a
statute,
providing
it
is--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--the
reason
why
this
statute
makes
perfect
sense
to
me,
at
least,
the
way
it's
drawn,
is
that
the
tort
of
invasion
of
privacy,
according
to
the
restatement
and
the
general
formulation
of
it
throughout
the
country
is
that
an
invasion
of
privacy
is
actionable
only
if
there
has
been
widespread
general
publicity
about
an
embarrassing,
private
fact.
gossip
over
a
backyard
fence,
telling
one,
two,
or
three,
or
four
people
is
not
a
tort
of
invasion
of
privacy.
the
tort,
itself,
requires
widespread
general
publicity.
so
when
you
draft
a
statute,
which
is
designed
to
protect
a
privacy
interest
and
support
an
invasion
of
privacy
action,
and
which
may
have
other
perfectly
good
reasons
behind
it,
what
you
want
to
prevent
is
widespread,
general
publicity.
and
the
way
you
do
that
is
to
address
instruments
of
mass
communication,
and
leave
out
the
gossip
over
the
backyard
fence,
and
all
of
those
kinds
of
things
which
would
not
be
actionable
in
an
invasion
of
privacy,
tort
in
the
first
place.
so
i
don't
think
that
this
statute,
by
limiting
itself
to
instruments
of
mass
communication,
because
that's
where
the
damage
is,
is
at
all
consistent
with
the
50
to
80
years
worth
of
common
law
development
of
the
tort
of
invasion
of
privacy.
for
that
reason
it
makes
sense--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--yes,
your
honor.
it
is
a
common
law
provision.
a
common
law
tort
in
which
you
must
prove
widespread,
general
publicity
about
an
embarrassing,
private
fact--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--i
cited
cason
v.
baskin,
which
is
the
leading
florida
decision.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
there's
no
statute
involved.
that
was
the
seminal
decision
in
which
florida
adopted
and
recognized
the
tort.
there
have
been
dozens
of
others
since.
but
i
didn't
spend
a
lot
of
time
arguing
the
common
law
to
the
court.
so,
only
cason
is
cited
to
the
court.
to
turn
back
a
moment
to
whether
or
not
this
information
was
in
the
public
domain.
let
me
suggest
to
you
that
when
this
woman
goes
to
the
police
station,
and
is
assured
a
guarantee
of
anonymity
if
she
reports
the
crime,
by
virtue
of
the
statutory
provision
which
makes
her
name
confidential
on
all
the
records,
and
a
statutory
provision
prohibiting
publication
of
that
name
in
an
instrument
of
mass
communication,
her
rights,
thereafter,
when
she
reports
the
crime,
ought
to
depend
on
the
law.
the
statute.
the
public
policy
of
the
law
of
the
state
of
florida
in
the
statute
books,
and
not
upon
the
competence
of
some
clerk
in
the
police
station.
the
first
amendment
ought
to
turn,
whether
it
covers
this
case,
or
doesn't
cover
this
case,
on
the
law
of
florida,
and
not
on
the
competence
of
a
clerk
in
the
police
station.
if
it
gets
out
that
no
matter
what
the
law
is,
if
you
go
down
and
report
this
crime,
your
name
may
end
up
in
a
newspaper
the
next
morning,
and
you're
helpless
to
do
anything
about
it,
if
some
clerk
screwed
up
and
put
the
paper
on
a
desk,
we
got
a
serious
problem.
and
i
would
suggest
that
you
can
analogize
this
argument
that
i'm
making
to
distinguish
cox
broadcasting
to
your
decision
in
seattle
times
v.
rhinehart.
in
that
case,
an
action
against
a
newspaper,
the
newspaper
asked
for
discovery
of
information,
which
the
plaintiff
said
involved
his
privacy
rights.
and
he
was
unwilling
to
give
it
up
to
the
defendant,
because
the
defendant
was
a
newspaper.
and
he,
therefore,
said,
"judge,
i
need
a
protective
order.
"
"i'll
give
him
this
material,
if
you
will
prohibit
them
from
publishing
it.
"
and
the
judge
entered
a
protective
order.
not
a
whole
lot
different
than
a
clerk
leaving
this
confidential
report
on
a
desk
in
a
press
room.
a
little
different,
but
not
a
whole
lot
different,
for
purposes
of
my
analogy.
this
court
affirmed
that
protective
order
on
the
ground
that
the
privacy
rights
of
this
litigant
were
important
enough
to
protect,
notwithstanding
that
this
was
truthful
information
that
had
come
into
the
hands
of
the
press
in
a
lawful
manner,
through
an
act
of
a
government
employee,
a
judge.
because
the
privacy
rights
were
so
important.
and
i
would
submit
that
the
statutory
scheme
in
florida,
i.e.
as
the
lower
courts
nave
held
as
a
matter
of
state
law
in
this
case,
this
information
on
this
document
is
non-public,
confidential
in
the
statute
which
says,
"and
if
it
comes
into
your
hands,
you
better
not
print
it.
"
are
the
same
type
of
a
protective
order
that
was
entered
in
seattle
times.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
i
agree
with
your
honor.
i
am
at
the
point
where
i
was
trying
to
distinguish
cox
broadcasting
and,
obviously,
i
need
to
turn
to
the
rebuttal
issue
here--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--i'm
not
the
least
bit
ashamed
to
stand
here
and
suggest
to
this
court,
notwithstanding,
that
you
were
unanimous
in
cox
broadcasting,
that
the
name
of
a
rape
victim
never
ought
to
be
in
a
newspaper
and
i
don't
care
where
they
get
it.
it
serves
no
purpose
whatsoever.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
i
have
done
my
best.
i
will
turn
to
the
second
issue--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--not
under
this
florida
statutory
scheme.
and
i
promised,
your
honor,
i
would
come
back
to
overbreadth,
which
i
should
very
briefly.
because
i'm
going
to
concede
that
as
long
as
cox
broadcasting
corp.
is
the
law
of
the
land,
this
794.03,
the
one
half
of
this
statutory
scheme
that's
an
issue
here,
is
overbroad.
but
the
florida
courts
have
construed
it,
to
save
it,
and
it
ought
to
be
saved
in
those
cases
where
it
can
be
applied.
now,
there
may
be
circumstances
where
a
rape
victim
has
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy,
that
this
statute
could
possibly
implement,
and
that's
clearly
the
case
in
his
example
with
senator
paula
hawkins.
where
she
holds
a
press
conference,
and
announces
this
to
the
world,
she
has
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
no
invasion
of
privacy
action
can
lie.
it
would
be
absurd.
and
no
florida
court
would
ever
apply
this
prohibition
against
printing
on
those
facts.
now,
the
overbreadth
challenge
was
raised,
only
briefly
below,
in
a
motion
for
directed
verdict,
which
was
abandoned
when
the
post-judgment
motions
were
abandoned
by
the
filing
of
a
notice
of
appeal.
it
was
not
argued
in
the
appellant's
initial
brief
below.
the
only
thing
i
had
to
defend
in
the
lower
court
was
an
"as
applied"
challenge.
overbreadth
was
mentioned
in
one
paragraph
in
a
reply
brief.
the
florida
law
is
clear
that
court
won't
consider
an
issue
raised
for
the
first
time
in
a
reply
brief.
and,
therefore,
i
think
the
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
this
statutory
scheme,
applied
in
the
context
of
a
common
law
invasion
of
privacy
action,
is
unconstitutional
as
applied,
and
not
overbroad.
so
i'm
not
prepared
to
concede
to
the
court
which
cases
fall
in,
and
which
cases
fall
out.
i
do
insist,
however,
that
this
case
clearly
falls
at
the
core
of
the
right
of
privacy
on
the
furthest
fringes
of
the
protections
provided
by
the
first
amendment.
and
to
apply
that
statute,
794.03,
to
the
facts
in
this
case,
once
those
conflicting
interests
are
balanced,
does
not
result
in
an
unconstitutional
impairment
of
the
first
amendment.
in
my
judgment,
the
first
amendment
interest
in
this
case
is
absolutely
trivial,
or
at
least
negligible.
this
court
has
written
over
and
over,
and
over
again,
although
it
is
not
yet
fully
pinned
down
what
the
precise
central
meaning
of
the
first
amendment
is,
it
seems
at
least
to
be
qualified
by
some
notion
that
the
first
amendment
protects
public
discussion
of
public
issues
in
matters
of
legitimate,
public
concern,
and
not
matters
about
private
people
and
their
private
concerns.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
no.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor,
in
the
dun
and
bradstreet
v.
greenmoss
builders
corp.,
this
very
court
said,
and
that
was
the
issue
in
the
case.
is
this
a
matter
of
public
concern,
or
is
it
not
a
matter
of
public
concern.
and
i
remember
that
the
court
was
fractionated
on
the
issue
of
whether
the
judiciary
ought
to
be
in
that
business.
and
it
can
be
avoided
in
the
defamation
context
by
your
private
figure,
public
figure,
public
official
status-related
test.
you
can't,
unfortunately,
you
can't
avoid
it
in
an
invasion
of
privacy
context,
because,
if
you're
going
to
recognize
the
tort
of
invasion
of
privacy
at
all,
it's
going
to
take
a
bite
out
of
the
first
amendment.
if
the
first
amendment
is
absolute
and
covers
the
publication
of
all
truths,
then
there
is
no
right
of
privacy,
because
there
is
no
enforceable
right
of
privacy.
so,
how
big
a
bite
you
allow
to
be
taken,
and
whatever
the
size
of
that
bit
is,
there's
going
to
be
a
line
there,
between
the
first
amendment
and
the
right
of
privacy.
and
i
submit
that
the
court,
although
it
has
not
pinned
the
central
meaning
of
the
first
amendment
down
in
the
defamation
context,
ought
to
come
out
somewhere
along
those
lines.
a
matter
of
legitimate,
public
concern.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
there
are
difficulties
with
that,
your
honor,
which
is
what
caused
the
common
law
of
invasion
of
privacy
to
draw
the
line
at
massive,
general
publicity,
rather
than,
and
exclude
these
other
things.
and
the
difficulties
are
that
this
woman
obviously
had
to
tell
some
people
about
her
rape
in
this
case.
her
mother,
who
was
taking
care
of
her
children.
she
had
to
tell
her
doctor;
she
had
to
tell
the
policemen.
the
policemen
have
to
tell
it
to
each
other.
there
are
many
people
who
have
to
know
about
this
thing.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
but,
your
honor,
you're
suggesting--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--fifty
people
under
florida
law,
she
probably
is
guilty
of
an
invasion
of
privacy,
without
the
benefit
of
the
statute,
under
florida
law.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
the
statute
just
addresses
"instruments
of
mass
communication".
absolutely,
your
honor.
the
newspapers
conceded
as
such
here,
by
conceding
on
the
record
below
that
the
journalism's
code
of
ethics,
its
own
policy,
and
the
policy
of
most
newspapers
is
that
you
don't
print
the
name
of
a
rape
victim.
because
there
is
no
legitimate,
public
concern
in
that.
in
the
simplest
way
to
understand
that
there's
no
legitimate,
public
concern
in
the
name
of
that
rape
victim
is
to
look
at
the
article,
omit
the
name,
and
see
if
the
substance
of
that
article
changes
in
any
way.
i
submit
that
it
does
not.
this
proceeding
has
preceded
it.
all
the
way
through
this
court,
we're
having
oral
arguments
about
some
serious
issues
here
today,
and
we
have
never
mentioned
this
woman's
name.
and,
the
fact
that
her
name
is
not
on
the
face
of
this
proceeding
does
not
detract
from
the
substance
of
this
proceeding
in
any
way.
there
can
be
no
legitimate,
public
concerns
sufficient
to
override
the
serious
interests
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case,
and
those
interests
are
the
plaintiff's
constitutional
right
of
privacy,
both
in
the
federal
constitution,
and
the
state
constitution
in
the
state
of
florida.
her
statutory
rights
of
privacy,
granted
by
the
two
statutes
in
issue
here,
her
common
law
right
of
privacy,
the
state's
interest
in
what
justice
o'connor
alluded
to,
when
she
talked
about
protecting
the
mental
and
physical
security
of
the
plaintiff.
if
you're
the
sole
eyewitness
to
a
rape,
and
your
assailant
didn't
know
you
before
the
rape,
the
last
thing
in
the
world
you
want
to
do
is
walk
down
to
the
police
station
and
have
your
name
in
the
public,
in
the
papers
the
next
day,
cause
all
that
has
to
happen
is
the
assailant
looks
you
up
in
the
phone
book,
finds
out
where
you
live,
and
eliminates
you
as
the
sole
eye
witness
to
the
crime.
that
is
a
very
compelling
interest
that,
the
state
has
to
have
in
guaranteeing
the
anonymity
of
this
victim,
even
at
the
expense
of
some
negligible
first
amendment
rights.
and
i
have
also
alluded
to
the
fact
that
the
state
has
a
compelling
interest
in
encouraging
people
to
report
crimes
of
rape
particularly
rape
crimes,
because
there
is
a
serious
underreporting
of
rape
crises
in
this
country.
and
on
the
compellingness
of
that
interest,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
canadian
supreme
court's
recent
decision
in
her
majesty
the
queen
v.
canadian
newspapers,
in
which
the
supreme
court
of
unanimous...
excuse
me,
the
supreme
court
of
canada
unanimously
upheld
against,
a
first
amendment,
or
a
freedom
of
the
press
challenge,
a
provision
allowing
a
complainant,
a
rape
victim,
to
get
a
court
order
from
a
judge
prohibiting
the
publication
of
her
name
in
instruments
of
mass
communication.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
they
have,
they
have
a
first
amendment,
which
is
very
similar
to
ours,
and
they
have
it
written
in
their
bill
of
rights,
a
provision
that
says,
"you
can't
modify
these
rights,
except
where
they're
reasonable
and
justified
in
a
free
and
democratic
society,
which
is
an
expression
of
what
this
court
does
in
all
these
cases,
when
it
balances
conflicting
interests
to
decide
whether
one
is
more
important
than
the
other.
"
and
i
would
submit--
mr.
joel
d.
eaton
--thank
you.
