proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
your
position
is
that
even
if
she'd
gone
in
and
stolen
the
information,
she'd,
the
paper
still
could
not
be
fined
for
reprinting
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
your
answer
to
justice

question?
he
asked
you
a
question
that
i
think
can
be
answered
by
yes
or
no.
chief

well,
i
thought

published,
was
used
in
the,
in
public
proceedings
in
the
judiciary.
that
these
were
freely
circulated

william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.

mr.
eaton.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
haven't
we
also
said
though,
mr.
eaton,
that,
generally,
it's
up
to
the
publishers
and
editors
of
newspapers
to
decide
whether
something
meets
that
standards
rather
than
the
government
saying
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
cited
somewhere
in
your
briefs?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
just
didn't
need
a
constitutional
provision
to
authorize
it.
