but
there
were
some
facts
in
the
record
before
he
did
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
just
asked
you,
were
there
some
facts
in
the
record,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
such
as:
justice
byron
r.
white
--how
the
reporter
got
the
information?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
was
it
also
that
she
knew
it
was
a
policy
of
the
newspaper
not
to
publish
it,
and
that
this
was
not
public
information?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
didn't
she
know
that
it
was
contrary
to
law
to
publish
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
in
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
of
course,
the
suit
is
against
the
paper,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
against
her?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
what
happened
then?
there
must
have
been
some
facts
in
the
record
about
what
happened
at
the
paper?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
there
could
hardly,
can
hardly
be
claimed
that
the
newspaper
didn't
know
that
it
was
against
the
law
to
publish
the
name?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
information
had
been
illegally
obtained,
as
if
the
reporter
had
gone
in
to
a
private
place,
and
obtained
it,
would
you
be
still
making
the
same
as
applied
argument?
you
might
be
making
the
overbreadth
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
would
you,
would
you
still
have
said
that
you
couldn't
be
held
liable
for
publishing
the
name?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
would,
would
you
say
the
paper
could
not
be
held
liable
for
publishing
the
name
of
the
rape
victim,
contrary
to
the
law,
if
the
information
had
been
illegally
obtained?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
can't
my
question
be
answered
yes
or
no?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
it's
stolen?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
nevertheless,
you
say
you
couldn't
be
held
liable
for
publishing
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
it
hadn't
been...
ever
been
in
the
public
domain?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the
information
had
never
been
in
the
public
domain?
you
could
not
be
held
liable
for
publication?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
a
penalty
for
publishing.
not
any
prior
restraint.
just
a
post
hoc
penalty
for
publishing
non-public
information.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,--
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
adopted
from
the
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
either
way
you're
engaging
in
speculation.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
the,
you
have
to
go
on
then,
and
say,
and
say
that,
say
that
the
interest
in
protecting
this
victim
is
so
important
that
it
overrides
the
interest
of
the
press.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
could
have...
the
same
argument
could
have
been
made
in
cox,
that
the
law
just,
wherever
you
find
this
information,
even
in
an
open
court
room,
is
just
plain
not
public
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
do
have
to
distinguish
cox,
and
you
have
done
your
best.
