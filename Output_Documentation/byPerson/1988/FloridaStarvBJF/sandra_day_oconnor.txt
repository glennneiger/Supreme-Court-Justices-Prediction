justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--counsel,
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ever
adopted
the
rule
you
propose,
of
absolute
freedom
to
publish
true
information.
what
would
that
rule
do
to,
for
example,
the
tort
of
publication
of
private
facts?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
know
that,
but
if
we
were
to
adopt
the
rule
you
ask
us
to
adopt,
that
would
be
gone,
presumably?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
is
the
tort
of
publication
of
private
facts
one
of
the
highest
order...
state
interest
in
the
highest
order?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
that
would
be
gone.
how
about
publishing
information
that
would
be
detrimental
to
national
security
during
war
time?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
publishing
information
in
violation
of
the
copyright
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
suppose
it's
perfectly
true.
is
that
a
defense
for
a
newspaper?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
there's
no
high,
compelling
state
interest
in
protecting
a
victim
of
rape
from
the
potential
of
physical,
further
physical
abuse,
and
physical
danger?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
there's
evidence
that
that
actually,
the
publication
here,
resulted
in
some,
some
additional
trauma
for
the
victim,
didn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
identity
of
the
victim
might
not
be,
and
it
put
this
woman
in
actual
physical
danger
from
the...
potentially,
from
the
person
who
assaulted
her
before,
who
had
not
been
arrested?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
state
have
no
interest
in
protecting
the
physical
safety
of
this
crime
victim,
pending
the
arrest
of
the
assailant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.,
mr.
eaton,
exactly
what
law
was
violated,
prior
to
publication
of
the
name?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
could
the
florida
star
have
been
prosecuted
under
florida
law,
if
it
had
not
published
the
name,
but
had
taken...
the
trainee
had
taken
the
name
down.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
then,
i
have
a
hard
time
understanding
your
argument
that
somehow
the
information
was
illegally
obtained.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
statute
makes
it
a
crime
to
publish?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
does
the
first
statute
subject
the
newspaper
to
prosecution
because
it
found
the
name
as
it
did?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
in
essence,
you
have
to
concede
that
the
information
was
lawfully
obtained
by
the
star?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
then,
can
you
cite
the
statute
that
was
violated?
