mr.
david
a.
bricklin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
twenty
years
ago
congress
enacted
the
national
environmental
policy
act,
nepa,
and
imposed
new
procedures
on
all
federal
agencies.
the
purpose
was
to
ensure
full
consideration
of
environmental
actions.
and
the
method
was
the
preparation
of
an
environmental
impact
statement,
a
statement
which
congress
said
is
to
be
"detailed".
compliance
is
to
be
"to
the
fullest
extent
possible".
congress'
mandate
to
the
agencies
in
the
vernacular
was
look
before
you
leap.
and
this
court
has
said
that
look
must
be
a
hard
look.
the
impact
statements
here
do
not
meet
the
standards
that
congress
established.
unsupported
conclusions
and
wish
lists
do
not
meet
the
detail
requirement.
and
sweeping
under
the
rug
difficult
issues
that
are
indicated
from
significant
new
information
and
uncertainty
does
not
meet
congress'
requirement
to
study
the
environmental
consequences
to
the
fullest
extent
possible.
that
these
impact
statements
do
not
meet
congress'
standards
was
recognized
not
only
by
the
courts
below,
but
by
state
and
federal
agencies
with
special
expertise
in
environmental
issues
and
by
29
states
that
have
joined
in
an
amicus
brief
in
this
court.
the
essence
of
the
solicitor
general's
argument
is
that
the
standards
established
by
congress
should
be
relaxed
by
this
court,
that
unsupported
conclusions
and
incomplete
analysis
should
suffice
despite...
despite
congress
saying
we
want
detail
and
compliance
to
fullest
extent
possible.
because
congress
established
these
standards,
it
is
only
congress
that
can
relieve
the
agencies
of
their
responsibility
to
comply
with
them.
the
solicitor
general's
efforts
in
this
court
must
fail.
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
no.
as
this
court
has
said,
nepa
is
essentially
a
procedural
statute.
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
yes,
there
is
language
in
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
that
says
nepa
imposes
substantive
duties.
that,
that
is
not
consistent
with
this
court
or...
this
court's
statements
or
the
act.
but
the
court's
decision
below
that
the
impact
statement
was
inadequate
was
not
based
upon
that
statement.
the
court
below
decided
the
impact
statement
was
not
adequate
because
it
was
conclusory,
because
it
didn't
provide
the
information
that
congress
required.
and
that
was
the
basis
of
the
court's
decision.
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
that's,
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
well,
two
things.
first
of
all,
it's...
it
is
not
the
case
that
the
mitigation
was
beyond
the
forest
service's
control.
for
instance,
to
protect
the
deer
herd's
habitat,
the
forest
service
could
have
purchased
habitat
throughout
the
methow
valley.
in
fact,
it's
co-petitioner,
the
army
corps
of
engineers,
in
another
case
spent
$7
million
purchasing
off-site
habitat
lands.
or
it
could
have
required
the
applicant
to
do
it.
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
okay.
even
regarding
mitigation
measures
that
may
be
beyond
the
agency's
control,
it
is
still
required
by
nepa
to
discuss
the
mitigation
measures
so
that
the
decision
maker
can
know
whether
the
mitigation
measures
will
work
regarding
air
quality.
the
impact
statement
told
the
forest
service
that
with
mitigation,
air
quality
standards
could
be
met.
the
impact
statements
said
that
without
mitigation
you
would
exceed
air
standards
by
a
factor
of
20.
now,
what
was
the
basis
of
that
conclusion?
there
was
nothing
in
the
impact
statement
or
anywhere
else.
it
was
a
completely
unsupported
conclusion
that
mitigation
would
allow
the...
allow
them
to
come
into
compliance
with
the
air
standards.
nepa's
purpose
is
to
allow
for
informed
decisions.
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
that
is
a
latter...
that
is
a
question
that
really
hasn't
been
reached
in
the
courts
below,
and
i
don't
think
it's
presented
here.
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
well,
the...
it's--
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
--there...
there's
two
parts
really
to
the
analysis,
i
believe.
one
is
there
is
the
procedural
information
part
of
the
analysis.
that's
what
the
impact
statement
does.
it
gathers
information
so
informed
decisions
can
be
made.
we
don't
have
that
here.
the
second
step
is
the
substantive
decision
that
the
agency
makes,
whether
to
proceed
with
the
ski
area,
if
so,
under
what
conditions.
that
is
a
separate
decision.
that's
a
separate
issue,
and
one
in
which
the
court
serves
a
different
function
under
the
administrative
procedures
act
to
determine
on
that
second
question
whether
the
agency
has
acted
arbitrarily
and
capricious,
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
strycker's
bay
and
in...
and
in
baltimore
gas.
but
that's
a
separate
question.
the
review
under
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard
of
the
substantive
decision
is
distinct
from
the
issue
of
whether
the
impact
statement
itself
is
adequate,
whether
it
provides
the
information
that
the
forest
service
needed
in
order
to
make
a
reasoned
decision.
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
the,
the
requirement
is
in
the,
the
administrative
procedures
act,
not
in
nepa.
it's
in
the
administrative
procedures
act,
not
nepa.
the
administrative
procedures
act
provides
that
agencies
shall
not
act
in
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
manner.
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
i
think
that's
both
reflected
in
footnote
2
of
the
strycker's
bay
opinion
and
in
vermont
yankee.
in
both
of
those
cases,
the
court,
although
it
held
that
nepa
was
essentially
procedural,
said
that,
nonetheless,
the
courts
under
the
apa,
apart
from
nepa,
have
the
responsibility
to
determine
whether
the
substantive
decision
was
arbitrary
and
capricious.
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
the...
the
solicitor
general
concedes
that
mitigation
measures
must
be
considered
to
the
fullest
extent
possible,
and
looks
at
the...
for
instance,
the
methow
valley
impact
statement
and
tries
to
excuse
compliance
with
that
procedural
mandate
on
the
basis
justice
scalia
inquired
earlier
about,
the
tiering,
for
instance.
now,
it
is
clear
that
the
solicitor...
that
the
solicitor
general's
reliance
on
this
tiering
issue
is
misplaced.
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
provides
that
the
environmental
impacts
of
the
activity
are
to
be
analyzed
in
the
impact
statement
regardless
of
whether
they
are
on
site
or
off
site,
regardless
of
whether
this
agency
has
control
of
them
or
doesn't
have
control
of
them.
and
the
act
simply
makes
no
distinction
between
the
level
of
discussion
that
is
required
dependent
upon
whether
the
impacts
are
on
site
or
off
site.
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
absolutely.
but
what
happened
in
this
case
was
the
forest
service
itself
recognized
that
the
off-site
impacts
were
the
more
severe
impacts,
that
those
were...
and
precisely
because
the
forest
service
recognized
that
those
were
the
more
severe
impacts,
it
was
those
impacts
that
the
forest
service
should
have
considered
in
more
detail.
and
in
the
elk
creek
case,
the
1,300
acres,
lost
habitat
behind
the
dam
that
the
solicitor
general
now
attempts
to
belittle
as
an
insignificant
impact,
the...
the
army
corps
itself
recognized
as
a
significant
impact.
the--
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
--no,
we,
we
do
not.
the
worst...
the
worst
case
analysis
or,
now
as
it's
called,
a
analysis
of
catastrophic
events,
is
analysis
that
flows
from
nepa's
mandate
to
consider
environmental
impacts
to
the
fullest
extent
possible.
and
it's
really
a
three-step
analysis,
and
it's
important
to
note
that
the
first
two
steps
are
not
in
dispute.
number
one,
if
there
is
uncertainty
regarding
what
the
effects
will
be,
that
uncertainty
must
be
disclosed.
no
one
disputes
that.
number
two,
if
there's
uncertainty,
the
agency
must
try
to
fill
the
information
void
by
conducting
additional
research.
nobody
disputes
that.
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
in,
in
this
case
we
knew
there
was
uncertainty,
for
instance,
in
the
elk
creek
case
because
several
agencies...
environmental
agencies
at
the
federal
and
state
level
took
issue
with
the
army
corps'
conclusion
that
there
would
not
be
a
turbidity
problem.
the
national
marine
fisheries
service,
the
environmental
protection
agency,
and
two
state
agencies
said
that
turbidity
was
going
to
be
a
major
problem.
in
fact,
the
environmental
protection
agency
reviewed
the
impact
statement
and
complained
that
it
had
left
unaddressed
the
major
issue
regarding
water
quality,
and
that
was
the
turbidity
issue.
so,
that's
how
we
know
in
this
case
that
there
was
uncertainty.
the
agencies
with
expertise
on
environmental
matters
said
there
was.
and
as
a
result,
the
army
corps
had
the
responsibility
of,
number
one...
number
one,
disclosing
that
and,
number
two,
attempting
to
do
the
research
to
fill
that
information
void.
and
it
was
only
if
that
was
unavailing
that
we'd
come
to
the
third
step,
which
is
where
the
dispute
rises
which
is
what
do
you
do
if
the
research
doesn't
fill
the
void.
and
what
the
new
regulation
requires
is
that
the
agency
consider
the
different
outcomes
that
are
possible,
including
in
the
words
of
the
new
regulation,
catastrophic
results
even
if
they
have
low
probability
of
occurrence.
and
that
is,
frankly,
nothing
different
than
what
the
case
law
and
what
the
prior
regulation
called
for
in
different
words
when
it
called
for
a
worst
case
analysis.
but
that's
not
critical
here.
what's
important
is
that
the
new
regulation,
on
its
face,
appears
to
be
consistent
with
nepa's
requirement
to,
number
one,
research
to
try
to
fill
the
information
gaps
and,
number
two,
if
you
can't
fill
them
and
you
still
have
uncertainty,
don't
look
at
the
world
through
rose-colored
glasses.
tell
us
what
bad
may
happen
as
well
as
what
good
may
happen.
now,
there's
another
issue
in
this
case
regarding
the
requirement
to
supplement
the
environmental
impact
statement.
the
court...
and
that
requirement
occurred
because
significant
new
information
came
to
light
after
the
impact
statement
was
prepared.
because
nepa
provides
a
continuing
responsibility
for
the
agencies
to
take
into
account
environmental
factors,
their
responsibilities
do
not
end
with
the
filing
of
an
impact
statement.
as
the
ceq's
regulations
reflect...
and
the
solicitor
general
acknowledges,
as
this
court
has,
that
they
are
entitled
to,
to
substantial
deference...
if
significant
new
information
comes
to
light,
a
supplemental
environmental
impact
statement
is
required.
now,
in,
in
the
briefs
we
describe
five
different
areas
in
which
significant
new
information
came
to
light.
i
just
want
to
focus
on
one
of
those
today,
and
that
regards
the
new
information
regarding
the
impact
or
fish,
new
information
that
was
revealed
when
a
dam
on
the
nearby
lost
creek
was
closed.
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
well,
it's...
it
clearly
came
to
light...
i
mean,
the
question
is
when
does
the
administrative
record
close?
and
where
you
have
significant
new
information
that
comes
to
light
after
the
supplemental
impact
statement
is
prepared--
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
--right.
the...
in
this
case,
the
new
information
came
to
light
in
a...
in
time
for
the
army
corps
to
use
it
in
a...
in
a
meaningful
manner,
and
that
is
why
it
should
have
been
considered
by
the
army
corps.
the--
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
--well,
in
other
words,
the
army
corps
learned
that
there
was
new
information
about
the
loss
of
the
fish.
the
army
corps
should
have
stopped
what
it
was
doing
at
that
point
because
you're
talking--
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
--well,
and
i
know
the
solicitor
general
suggests
that
that
is
what
happened
here,
and
i
need
to
make
clear
and,
and...
that,
first
of
all,
that
argument
was
raised
for
the
first
time...
in
three
years
of
litigation,
it
was
raised
for
the
first
time
in
the
reply
brief.
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
yes.
the
new
information
in
this
case
was
provided
several
years...
to
the
army
corps,
more
than
a
year
before
the
time
of
trial,
and
at
a
time
when
the
dam
was
not
under
construction,
and
when
changes
in
the
army
corps'
decision
could
still
be
made.
and
specifically,
because
the
army
corps
learned
that
the
fish
in
the
rogue
river,
which
is
recognized
as
one
of
the
greatest
fishing
rivers
in
the
world...
and
we
learned
that
there
may
be
a
devastating
impact
on
the
fishery,
and
the
army
corps
hasn't
built
the
dam
yet,
well,
then
let's
stop
and
take
a
look
at
this
new
information
because--
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
--no,
and
that's...
in,
in
fact,
what
the...
the
army
corps
did
not
dispute
the
significance
of
the
information
and
nor
did
the
dissenting
judge
below.
what
the
dispute
was
was
as
to
the
accuracy
of
the
information.
and
the
information...
and
let
me
elaborate
on
that
for
a
minute
or
two
if
i
may.
the
information
that
was
provided
was
the
result
of
a
study
of
the
closure
of
the
lost
creek
dam
on
a
nearby
tributary.
this--
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
--of
the
rogue.
and
this
study
was
commissioned
by
the
army
corps
itself.
it
was
a
ten-year
study
that
examined
the
fishery
downstream
from
the
dam
both
before
the
lost
creek
dam
was
built
and
afterward.
and
what
this
study
revealed
was
that
it...
that
the
closure
of
the
dam
caused
a
warning
of
the
waters
downstream
and
the
warmer
waters
caused
the
eggs,
the
salmon
eggs,
buried
in
the
gravel
to
hatch
prematurely,
two
months
prematurely.
and
it
was
a
critical
two
months
because
of
hatching...
because
instead
of
hatching
in
the
spring,
they
hatch
in
the
middle
of
the
winter.
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
well,
they,
they
claim--
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
--they,
they
argued
in
court
that
they
did...
that
the
information,
if
accurate,
was
significant,
but
they
disputed
the
accuracy.
and
in
doing
that,
they--
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
--i--
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
--actually
if
you
will
beg
my
indulgence
for
a
second,
i
think
it's
yet
a
third
standard.
i
believe
the
standard
is
established
in
the
administrative
procedures
act,
which
provides
that
agency
actions
are
to
be
reviewed,
among
other
things,
to
determine
whether
they
have...
whether
they
are
in
accordance
with
the
law.
and
that's
in
706(2)(a).
and
in
fact,
the
preamble
in
706--
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
--for
factual
determinations.
but
we
are
here
interpreting
a
statute.
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
yes,
a,
a...
a
question
of
the
accuracy
of
the
study
would.
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
except
that
under
the
case
law
that
has
develop
under
the
environmental
policy
act
that
a
rule
of
reason
has
been
applied,
and
that
is--
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
--i,
i
think
the
court
has
to
decide
that,
but
that
determination
is
limited
to
factual
issues.
regarding
legal
issues,
in
other
words,
what
did
congress
mean
when
it
said
significant?
does
a
particular
impact
rise
to
this
level
of
significance?
that's
a
legal
question
which
the
courts
decide
de
novo.
now,
coming
back
to
this
question
of
the
accuracy
of
the
study
that
was
prepared
at
the
corps'
behest,
ten-year
study,
$4
million,
and
it
considered
many,
many
different
issues
not
just
this
issue
about
the
stream
warming
and
causing
the
early
hatching
of
the
eggs.
it
reached
conclusions
about
the
size
of
the
fish,
the
timing
of
their
migration
and
a
lot
of
other
things.
it's
a
big,
fat,
several
hundred-page
study.
and
the
corps
of
engineers
sent
it
out
for
review
by
two
outside
people
that
they
picked
and
one
inside.
and
those
reviewers
found
some
problems
with
some
of
the
conclusions
in
this
study.
and
it
is
those
critiques
that
the
solicitor
general
and
the
agency
latch
onto
in
suggesting
that
this
conclusion
about
the
temperature
impact
was
not
accurate.
but
all
of
those
critiques
focused
on
other
conclusions
in
the
study.
and
with
regard
to
this
conclusion,
that
the
dam
raises
the
temperature
and
causes
the
early
hatching
of
the
eggs,
that
conclusion
was
not
questioned
by
anyone.
and
in
fact,
the
reviewer
who
was
the
most
critical
of
other
sections
of
this
study,
mr.
matthews...
he
specifically
agreed
with
these
conclusions,
and
the
army
corps
agreed
that
the
biology
underlying
those
conclusions
makes
sense.
and
so,
please
do
not
be
misled
when,
when
the
solicitor
general
and
the
agencies
below
quote
out
of
context
other
portions
of
these
critiques
because
it
was
not
directed
at
this
key
finding
regarding
the
warming
of
the...
of
the
waters
downstream.
i
want
to
go
back
for
one
minute
and
talk
about
one
issue
regarding
mitigation
which
has
reached
the...
that
the
solicitor
general
has
drawn
some
attention
to,
and
that
regards
the
court
of
appeals
reference
to
a
complete
mitigation
plan.
and
the
solicitor
general
has
suggested
that
this
is
again
the
court
below
imposing
new
procedures
not
required
by
the
act.
it
is...
it
is
clear
when
the
court's
decision
in
the
marsh
case,
where
this
first
appeared...
when
that
decision
is
read
in
context,
that
the
complete
mitigation
plan
that
the
court
was
referring
to
was
nothing
more
than
the
complete
mitigation
analysis
that
the
solicitor
general
and
everyone
recognizes
must
be
included
in
an
impact
statement.
and
i'd
like
to
point
the
court's
attention,
in
fact,
to
that
part
of
the
opinion
where
this
language
appears.
the
opinion
is
the
first
appendix
in
the
marsh
case,
and
at
page
8a
and...
excuse
me...
6a
and
7a,
the
court
makes
reference
to
the
analysis
in
the
impact
statement
of
the
mitigation
elements.
and
notice
that
the
court
refers
to
this
discussion
as
a
plan.
it
says
this
mitigation
plan
requires
such
and
such.
and
so,
on
page
7a,
when
the
court
says
the
importance
of
a
mitigation
plan
cannot
be
overestimated
or
when
it
says
without
a
complete
mitigation
plan
the
decision
maker
is
unable
to
make
an
informed
decision,
it
is
clear,
reading
this
in
context,
that
the...
that
the
court
is
requiring
a
complete
mitigation
discussion.
and
in
fact,
this...
the
court
says
so
itself
in
the
next
paragraph.
in
the...
in
the
last...
or
in
the
last
paragraph
before
section
3
on
page
7a,
the
court
says
that
because
the
wildlife
mitigation
plan
here
merely
lists
measures
and
includes
neither
an
analysis
nor
an
explanation
of
effectiveness,
it
is
inadequate.
that's
what
the
court
was
looking
for,
an
analysis,
an
explanation
of
effectiveness
of
what
the
costs
would
be.
and
that's
all
the...
that's
all
the
court
meant
when
it
required
a
mitigation
plan.
in
sum,
regarding
the
mitigation,
the
fact
that
the
impact
statements
here
relied
exclusively
upon
conclusions
that
did
not
have
any
support
in
any
facts
or
any
studies
and
relied
upon
mere
wish
lists,
that
does
not
meet
congress'
purposes,
does
not
meet
the
standard
of
preparing
a
detailed
statement,
and
rendered
the
impact
statements
inadequate.
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
well,
if
first
of
all
we
mean
a
plan
in
the
sense
of
an
analysis,
a
full
discussion,
yes,
because
that's
what
nepa
requires.
if
we're
talking
about
some
other
different
procedural
construct,
the
forest
service
regulations
do
require
a...
the
applicant
to
submit
a
mitigation
plan,
and
then
goes
on
and
requires
the
agency
to
implement
and
condition
the
permit
with
mitigation
terms
and
conditions.
and
so,
yes,
in
that
case
it
is
required.
and
that
actually
brings
me
back
to
the
question
that
the
chief
justice
inquired
about.
where
does...
where
under...
would
we
have
any
substantive
requirements
to
apply?
here
the
forest
service's
own
regulations
require
the
applicant
to
submit
detailed
plans
and
then
goes
further
and
requires
the
agency
to
implement
and
include
mitigation
plans--
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
--well,
yes
and
the...
yes.
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
presumably
it
did.
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
that's
clear.
but
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
plain
meaning
of
the
regulation
says
one
thing
and
the
agency
does
something
else,
then
deference
is
not
required.
and
i
think
that's
the
situation
we
have
here.
the--
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
--it
is
clear,
but
it
is
also
clear
that
that
will
have
no
usefulness
in
determining
how
to
mitigate
the
off-site
impacts
which
the
forest
service
recognizes
as
the
more
significant
impacts.
the
mitigation...
the
on-site
master
development
plan
is
going
to
tell
the
applicant
where
to
put
the
specific
ski
runs
and
ski
lifts.
that's
all
well
and
fine,
but
it
doesn't
do
anything
to
address
the
issue
of
how
are
we
going
to
deal
with
the
loss
of
deer
herd
in
other
areas
of
the
valley.
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
no.
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
that...
that
is
true.
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
that's
true
with
regard
to
the
on-site...
to
some
of
the
on-site
mitigation.
in
other
words,
if
you're
talking
about
runoff
from
the
ski
slopes
that
are
cleared,
where
are
you
going
to
put
in
your
catch
basins?
yes,
that
would
wait
till
you
have
your
ski
area
laid
out
in
front
of
you.
but
where
here
you're
talking
about...
where
the
agency
is
talking
about
loss
of
wildlife
habitat
elsewhere
in
the
valley
or
air
pollution
occurring
elsewhere
in
the
valley,
the
location
of
the
ski
runs
isn't
going
to
provide
the
agency
with
any
more
information
regarding
that.
and
in
fact,
in
their
reply
brief,
the
solicitor
general
finally
admits
just
that,
that
there
is
no
second
tier
regarding
the
off-site
impacts,
and
that's
a
critical,
critical
difference
between
the
on-site
and
off-site
impacts.
the
off-site
impacts
are
the
more
severe,
and
there's
not
a
second
tier
regarding
those.
in
sum,
this
is
neither
the
time
nor
the
place
for
relaxing
nepa
standards
for
detailed
statements
and
compliance
to
the
fullest
extent
possible.
congress'
mandate
has
never
been
more
important.
environmental
hazards
that
20
years
ago
were
barely
recognized
today
face
us
in
full
force.
witness
nuclear
wastes
seeping
into
our
groundwater,
the
warming
of
the
global
atmosphere,
and
the
loss
of
the
ozone
layer.
nor
is
this
is
the
place
for
relaxing
congress'
standards.
the
solicitor
general's
pleas
for
relief
in
this
court
must
be
unavailing.
this
court's
decision
far
transcends
the
issues
regarding
a
ski
area
and
a
dam.
at
a
time
when
the
leaders
of
the
greatest
nations
in
the
world
rank
the
environmental
hazards
as
major
problems
confronting
national
and
international
security,
the
solicitor
general's
plea
for
perfunctory
compliance
with
nepa
must
be
rejected.
assuring
fully
informed
decisions
has
never
been
more
important.
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
absolutely.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
that's--
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
--it's
a
rule
of--
mr.
david
a.
bricklin
--and
the
ceo
regulations
reflect
that
when
they
define
significance
in
term
of...
in
terms
of
intensity
of
the
impact
and
the
value
of
the
resource.
thank
you.
