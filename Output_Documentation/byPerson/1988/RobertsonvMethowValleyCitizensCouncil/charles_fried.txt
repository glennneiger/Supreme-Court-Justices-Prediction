mr.
charles
fried
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court,
in
a
series
of
cases,
has
made
quite
clear
what
nepa
does
and
does
not
requires
nepa
requires
analysis
and
disclosure.
it
requires
that
the
agency
take
a
hard
look
at
environmental
effects
of
proposed
action,
and
public
participation
and
assurance
that
this
hard
look
has
been
taken.
it
does
not
require...
and
ceq
regulations
make
this
clear...
more
and
more
information.
more
is
not
necessary
more...
more.
sometimes
it
is
less.
that
is
why
this
court
imposes
page
limits.
the
function
of
the
environmental
impact
statement
is
to
inform
the
decision
maker,
not
to
bullet-proof
him
against
obstructionist
litigation.
furthermore,
the...
the
court
has
made
quite
clear
what
nepa
does
not
do.
it
does
not
impose
any
substantive
environmental
requirements,
nor
does
it
dictate
the
relative
weights
to
be
given
to
environmental
as
opposed
to
other
concerns.
in
this
respect,
it's
worth
contrasting
nepa
with
the
endangered
species
act
or
section
4(f)
of
the
transportation
act.
the
court
of
appeals
in
these
cases
ignored
these
general
precepts
in
overturning
not
only
the
agency's
decisions,
but
those
of
reviewing
district
courts,
and
it
made
two
specific
legal
errors
common
to
both
cases.
first,
it
demanded
that
the
agency
not
just
discuss
and
consider
mitigation
opportunities,
but
that
it
commit
in
the
plan
to
complete
and
effective
mitigation
measures.
the
respondents
should
not
be
allowed
to
hide
behind
the
confusion
that
this
substantive
obligation
is
put
forward
as
a
requirement
of
what
is
supposed
to
be
an
analytic
and
descriptive
document.
mr.
charles
fried
justice
o'connor,
i
think
here
as
throughout
what
governs
is
the
rule
of
reason.
and
the
more
significant
the
environmental
impact
and
the
more
important
the
mitigation,
of
course,
the
greater
the
obligation
to
go
into
detail.
this
is
very
well
illustrated
by
one
of
the
things
out
of
which
the
court
of
appeals
made
such
heavy
weather,
which
was
the
wildlife
in
the
marsh
case.
that's
the
elk
creek
dam.
in
that
case
there
were
substantial
environmental
impacts
in
respect
to
the
turbidity
of
the
water,
the
muddying
of
the
water,
downstream
from
the
dam.
but
also,
the
dam
was
going
to
flood
1300
acres.
and
we
were
faulted
because
we
did
not
go
into
great
detail
about
what
we
were
going
to
do
for...
and
here,
it's
worth
listing.
we
had
50
deer,
a
smaller
number
of
elks,
coyotes,
otter
skunks
and
125
quail
whose
habitat
was
going
to
be
flooded
by
that
lake
now,
we
did
not
go
into
a
great
deal
of
detail
about
that.
mr.
charles
fried
no,
i
don't
think
that's
correct.
what
we
said...
we
committed
to
spend
$350,000
in
cultivating
what
are
called
"edges"
which
is
variations
in
foliage
height
because
that
is
a
more
agreeable
habitat
for
those
animals
which
had
been
observed.
it's
not
clear
that
they
were
going
to
be
somehow
wiped
out.
it's
a
little
bit
like
noah's
ark,
except
that
reminds
me
when--
mr.
charles
fried
--oh,
i
think
you
do
for
anything
of
significance.
i
think
what
you
have
here
are--
mr.
charles
fried
--well,
they
did
do
a
little
bit
more
than
that,
but
you
have
to
be
reasonable.
how
significant
is
the
impact
and,
therefore,
how
much
do
you
have
to
say
about
what
you're
going
to
do
about
the
impact?
and
when
you
see
the
mountain
that
was
made
out
of
this
mole
hill,
you
understand
that
this
is
just
a
charter
for
obstruction.
when
we
talk
about
serious
impacts,
such
as
air
quality
in
the
other
case,
the...
the
forest
service
case,
then
you've
got
to
go
into
more
detail.
but
when
you're
talking
about
a
few
animals
that
had
been
observed
and
the
lake
is
rising,
the
waters
will
rise,
and
so
you're
going
to
do
a
little
bit
for
them,
but
you're
not
making
a
big
deal
out
of
something
that
isn't
a
big
deal,
i
think
to
say
that
you
have
to
go
into
excessive
detail
there
is
exactly
what
ceq
was
focusing
on.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
the
circuit
court
should
certainly
defer
to
the
district
court
insofar
as
the
district
court
held
a
trial
and
established
facts.
when
we're
talking
about--
mr.
charles
fried
--well,
i
think
you...
really
there
should
not
be
a
factual...
a
new
factual
record
developed,
but
that
practice
has
taken
place,
and
we
have
factual
issues
that
were
raised--
mr.
charles
fried
--well,
in
marsh
there
were
several
things
that
happened
that
shouldn't
have
happened.
in
marsh
the
kramer
memorandum
and
the
things
which
are
supposed
to
have
set
off
some
of
these
insufficiencies
were
raised
at
the
trial.
they
were
not
raised
at
the
administrative
level.
it
reminds
one
very
much
of
vermont
yankee,
where
it's
a
little
bit
of
an
ambush.
now,
the
standard
of
review
quite
clearly
should
be
apa
review.
was
the
agency
arbitrary
and
capricious,
first
of
all,
in
its
decision,
of
course,
and
second,
in
its
approach
to
what
it
does
and
does
not
include
in
the
environmental
impact
statement?
mr.
charles
fried
well,
it...
it's
not
i
think
of
great
significance.
if
the
agency
is
continuing
to
look
at
mitigation,
that's
good.
the
question--
mr.
charles
fried
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
i
think
that
what
we're
talking
about
was
extra
efforts,
extra
measure
of
concern,
and,
and
that's
appropriate.
but
it
would
seem--
mr.
charles
fried
--well,
tiering
is
not
an
issue
so
much
in
the
marsh
case
as
it
is
in
robertson.
in
robertson
you
have...
in
respect
to
the
on-site
effects
of
building
the
ski
slope,
there
is
the
question
about
whether
the
location
of
the
roads
and
the
slopes
and
the
towers
and
the...
and
the
ski
trails
will
interfere
with
the
mule
deer.
and
as
to
tiering,
what
the
agency
did
is
to
say
these
are
problems.
we
understand
they're
problems,
but
we
want
to
see
the
master
plan
first
before
we
decide
whether
they
are
going
to
interfere
with
the
mule
deer.
and
that's
a
rather
small
scale
version
of
what
we
saw
in
the
kleppe
case.
mr.
charles
fried
oh,
it
may
very
well.
oh,
yes.
the
approval
of
the
master
plan
requires
at
the
very
least
an
environmental
assessment,
and
it
may
require
an
eis.
and
it
is
at
that
point,
at
the
point
of
the
approval
of
the
master
plan,
that
the
detailed
inquiry
as
to
whether
the
roads
will
or
will
not
cut
off
the
migration
routes
of
the
deer
would
take
place.
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
have
it
take
place
now
because
the
permittee
would
have
to
develop
the
master
plan
before
he
got
the
right
to
occupy
the
land.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
there's...
there's
really
no
question
that
there
is
further
environmental
assessment
that
is
required
in
respect
to
the
acceptance
of
a
master
plan.
it
may
not
require
an
environmental
impact
statement.
that
will
depend
on
whether
it
is
a
major
or
a
minor
matter.
but
then
assessment
must
be
made
at
that
time.
and
the
permit,
and
the
record
of
decision
in
the
robertson
case
quite
clearly
indicates,
that
the
master
plan
must
be
approved.
well,
that
approval
is
an
action
which
is
subject
to
environmental
review.
and
that's
the
point
at
which
you
go
into
those
details.
mr.
charles
fried
i
fear
it
would
not
have
satisfied
the
ninth
circuit,
but
the
respondents
tell
us
that
it
would.
i'm
afraid
that
what
we
have
is
one
of
these
situations
where
today
you
are
told
it's
dicta
and
tomorrow
we'll
be
told
it's
stare
decisis.
mr.
charles
fried
there
is
indeed,
but
it
is
confusing
because,
after
all,
an
environmental
impact
statement
is
not
an
appropriate
document
for
making
commitments.
it
is
an
analytic
and
descriptive
document.
and
that
is
one
of
the
central
issues
in
this
case.
specifically,
what
we
ask
the
court
to
do
in
respect
to
mitigation
is
to
rule...
to
rule...
that
mitigation
is
an
obligation...
involves
an
obligation
to
describe
and
to
describe
reasonably.
if
the
effects
are
trivia,
then
the
description
may
be
cursory.
if
the
effects
are
in
the
future,
then
the
description
may
be
general
and
postponed.
and
if
the
effects
are
upon
us,
then
they
must
be
dealt
with
now.
but
it
is
a
matter
of
description,
and
we're
asking
the
court
to
rule
and
to
clarify
the
confusion
which
the
ninth
circuit,
at
best
confusion
has
injected.
we
are
asking
also
that
as
applied
in
this
case,
on
remand,
the...
there
be
no
obligation
in
respect
to
any
of
these
matters
to
engage
in
further
mitigation
discussion
because
we
believe...
and
we've
set
this
out
in
the
briefs...
that
the
mitigation
discussion
for
these
levels
of
decision
has
been
entirely
sufficient.
mr.
charles
fried
yes,
justice
scalia.
now--
mr.
charles
fried
--well,
i
think--
mr.
charles
fried
--well,
the,
the,
the...
this
calls
we
back
to
the...
the
answer
i
gave
to
justice
o'connor's
question.
it
can't
mean
that
you
have
to
identify
every
single
effect
no
matter
how
trivial
that
cannot
be
mitigated.
it's
a
little
bit...
think
of
the
analogy
to
the
informed
consent
before
surgery.
the
more
you
go
into
it,
the
less
useful
it
is
to
the
patient.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
that--
mr.
charles
fried
--as
to...
as
to
the
county's
efforts,
there
is
another
issue
there
because
the
obligation
to
mitigate
is
really
the
obligation
of
the
local
authorities,
and
it
would
be
inappropriate
for
the
forest
service
to
somehow
commit
the
county
to
actions
which
are
within
its
range
of
responsibilities.
therefore,
it
was
inevitable
that
the
environmental
impact
statement
indicated
what
the
local
authorities
might
do.
but
again,
the
kind
of
description
is
appropriate
to
the
kind
of
action.
the
action
is
the
action
of
others
whose
responsibility,
in
some
cases
statutory
responsibility,
it
is
and
therefore
the
explanation
is,
is,
is
at
an...
a
equivalent
level
of
generalization.
mr.
charles
fried
it
is
possible.
it
would
be
inappropriate
because
nepa
is...
one
of
the
things
that
it
is
not
and
cannot
be
allowed
to
become
is
a
federal
land
use
planning...
a
federal
land
use
or
federal
zoning
ordinance
imposed
on
local
authorities.
and
it
would
be
even
more
inappropriate
to
hold
the
permittee
hostage
to
the
local
authorities
doing
what
it
is
their
responsibility
to
do,
in
some
respects
their
statutory
responsibility...
under
the
clean
air
act
and
clean
water
act,
for
instance,
their
statutory
responsibility
to
do.
so,
i
think
we're
entitled
to
assume
that
local
authorities
will
do
their
job,
and
to
advert
to
mitigation
accordingly
in
an
appropriate
way.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to--
mr.
charles
fried
--[inaudible].
it
adverts
to
it,
and
it
is
clearly
adverted
to.
there
is
no...
it
is
not
as
if
this
is--
mr.
charles
fried
--well,
but
there
is
advertence
to
it,
it,
it,
it
is
something
which
is
confronted.
studies
were
done,
and
we're
talking
only
about
mitigation.
the
mitigation
is
the
obligation
of
the
local
authorities.
this
development,
this
migration,
is
something
which
is
taking
place
in
any
event.
it
would
be
accelerated
by
the
ski
resort,
but
it
is
not
the
only
cause
of
it.
this
would
not
remain
a
wilderness
if
there
were
no
ski
resort.
and
this
is
something
which
the
local
authorities
have
to
deal
with.
there
is
another
matter
here,
which
it's
important
to
get
before
the
court,
which
relates
to
the
worst
case
analysis,
because
the
ninth
circuit
in
both
cases
clearly
demanded
that
in
respect
to
uncertainties
and,
indeed,
matters
which
were
simply
matters
in
dispute
where
we
took
one
view
and
the
opponents
took
another,
that
there
must
be
a
worst
case
analysis,
that
we
must
assume
the
worst
in
analyzing
the
effects.
now,
we
ask
the
court
to
rule
that
that
is
incorrect
as
a
matter
of
law
because
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
that
obligation
derived
from
nepa
itself
rather
than
from
ceq
regulations
which
have
now
been
superseded.
and
as
applied,
we
believe,
that
these
are
not
proper
cases
for
uncertainty
analysis
at
all
even
under
the
new
ceq
regs
because
what
we
have
is
not
uncertainty,
what
we
have
is
a
dispute.
we
think
that
the
dam
is
going
to
cause
this
level
of
turbidity,
and
our
opponents
think
it's
going
to
cause
some
other
level
of
turbidity.
if
the
ninth
circuit
is
to
be
believed,
there
is
always
an
obligation
to
analyze
the
effects
as
if
the
opponents,
the
people
who
see
this
in
the
most
dramatic
and
drastic
lights,
are
correct
and
to
analyze
on
that
basis.
that
can't
be
what
ceq
meant
in
either
the
old
or
the
new
regulations.
but
in
any
event,
it's
very
important
to
clarify
that
those
new...
those
old
regulations
are
gone
and
are
not
part,
and
never
were
part,
of
nepa
itself.
if,
if,
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve--
mr.
charles
fried
--well--
mr.
charles
fried
--the
eis
here
has
a
recommendation.
they
recommended...
they
recommended
the
8,400-person
ski
resort,
and
they
did
conclude
in
the
eis
that
that
is
a
recommendation
that
makes
sense
even
given
the
uncertainties
about
whether
the
state
and
local
officials
will
do
their
job.
it...
that
was
the
recommendation.
and,
and
i
think
one
can
look
to
the
record
of
decision
of
the
regional
forester
who
clearly
said,
look,
i
am
prepared
to
go
forward.
i
understand
what
risks
we
are
running.
so,
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
them
in
tandem,
you
clearly
come
out
as
we
say...
but
there
is
a
recommendation
in
the
eis
which
says
that
these
environmental
hazards
are
worth
running.
now,
the
decision
maker
may
say,
well
you've
laid
them
out
for
us,
and
we
don't
agree
with
you.
we...
i,
regional
forester,
do
not
agree
that
these
environmental
impacts
are
worth
running.
but
the
environmental
impact
statement
does
make
a
recommendations
and,
and,
and
says
it's
worth
doing
on
that
basis.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
save
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
charles
fried
a
few
factual
matters.
among
the
states
which
have
joined
the
respondents
are
not
included
the
states
of
washington
and
oregon.
as
to
when
the
kramer
memorandum,
which
included
what
is
defined...
what
is
argued
to
be
the
significant
new
information,
it
is
true
it
came
a
year
before
trial,
but
it
was
submitted
after
suit
was
filed.
and
the
judgment
of
the
corps
was
that
the
information
there
was
casual
and
unreliable.
that
conclusion,
as
well
as
epa's
comments,
were
submitted
to
the
council
on
environmental
quality;
and
there
was
no
objection
raised
there.
so,
i
think
what
we
have
is
an
argument
that
uncertainty
is
to
be
equated
with
a
dispute
between
proponents
and
opponents
of
a
measure,
and
that
cannot
be
a...
that
is
an
argument--
mr.
charles
fried
--well,
there
is
on--
mr.
charles
fried
--well,
i
think
there
is
some...
there
was
some
thought
that
it
would
have
something
to
do
with
the
time
the
eggs
would
hatch.
that's
correct.
but
it
was
not
as
important
to
the
life
cycle
of
the
fish
as
it
was
claimed.
mr.
charles
fried
in
other
words,
the
matter
was...
the
sir,
the
supplemental
information
review,
did
address
this.
they
looked
at
it,
but
they
concluded
that
it
did
not
have
the
scientific
or
the
ecological
effects
which
were
being
claimed
for
it.
and
as
to
the
turbidity,
we
just
thought
they
were
wrong.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
i
don't...
i
think
that--
mr.
charles
fried
--it
was--
mr.
charles
fried
--well,
i
don't
think
there
is
a
dispute
on
when
the
eggs
would
hatch.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
i
think
there
was
a
dispute
about
whether
that
measure
of...
that
difference
of
hatching
would
make
that
difference,
yes.
now,
you
can
treat
that
as
a
question
of
law,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
is
much
more
a
question
of
what
is
important
to
fish,
and
that
sounds
to
me
like
a
factual
matter.
and
more
specifically,
we
strongly
assert
that
these
factual
matters
are
to
be
governed
by
the
apa
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard
as
well
as
the
question
of
whether
the
decision
whether
to
reopen
the
record
and
perform
yet
another
analysis,
because
this
is
a
project
that
has
been
under
study
for
quite
a
long
time,
is
itself
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard.
mr.
charles
fried
oh,
yes,
on
the--
mr.
charles
fried
--but
only
as
to
specific
matters
about
the
combined
effects
of
all
three
dams.
we
didn't
think
that
was
an
issue
which
was
worth
bringing
to
this
court.
what
we
would
a
strongly
urge
is
that
there
be
no
remand
on
any
of
the
matters
subject
to
the
litigation
here
because
we
are
concerned
not
only
about
the
two
specific
legal
issues,
which
i
take
the
respondents
to
have
conceded,
but
we
are
concerned
about
the
approach
of
the
court
of
appeals
here
which
is
just
unduly
persnickety.
we
are
told
that
there
is
a
wish
list,
and
that
"wish
list"
phrase
occurs
in
the
elk
creek
dam
case.
and
i
must
say
the
only
thing
to
which
that
nice
phrase
can
apply
is
those
skunks
and
coyotes
and
so
on
that
have
been
flooded
out,
and
it
seems
inappropriate
to
say
this
is
an
insufficiently
detailed
mitigation
statement
because
it's
just
a
wish
list.
so,
we
would
require
guidance
not
only
on
the
legal
issues
which
have
been
conceded,
but
also
on
the
appropriate
approach,
and
we
think
the
approach
of
the
ninth
circuit
here
has
not
been
appropriate
because
on
mitigation...
on
mitigation
you
have
three
kinds
of
things
bearing
on
reasonableness.
first
of
all,
just
how
significant
is
the
impact
and
can't
you
tailor
your
discussion
to
how
big
a
deal
you've
got
here.
second,
there
is
the
issue
of
tiering
which
is
the
question
of
is
the
issue
ripe
for
detailed
discussion
or
is
general
conceptual
discussion
sufficient.
and
finally,
the
discussion
should
appropriately
take
into
account
who
it
is
that
is
going
to
be
doing
the
mitigation,
and
if
it's
state
and
local
authorities
that
are
going
to
be
doing
it,
then
the
kind
of
discussion
is
appropriately
more
conceptual
than
it
would
be
if
the
actual
decision
maker
would
be
the
one
asked
to
do
the
mitigation.
and
this
is
all
just
spinning
out
the
rule
of
reason
as
to
the
detail
of
the
mitigation
statement.
in
other
words,
it
musn't
be
forced
to
be
so
detailed
that
it
ceases
to
be
useful
to
the
decision
maker
and
just
becomes
a
kind
of
a
mine
field
which
the
agency
has
to
try
somehow
to
negotiate
lest
it
blow
up
on
them
at
suit,
at
trial,
perhaps
indeed
in
a
court
of
appeals.
one
doesn't
know
when.
that's--
mr.
charles
fried
--oh,
i--
mr.
charles
fried
--i
hope
i
chose
my
words
carefully.
it
is
the--
mr.
charles
fried
--it
is
the
agency
which,
is
bound
to
apply
a
rule
of
reason.
a
reviewing
court
applies
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard.
now,
i
must
tell
the
court--
mr.
charles
fried
--that
is
correct.
agencies
have
consistently
come
to
the
solicitor
general
and
asked
him
to
bring
to
this
court
cases
in
which
courts
of
appeal
and
district
courts
have
said,
well,
it's
a
rule
of
reason
that
governs
us.
and
we
have
thought
that
issue
all
by
itself
is
not
worth
bothering
the
court
with
because
it
may
be
rather
verbal.
but
since
we
have
it
here,
it
would
be
a
marvelous
opportunity
to
clarify
that
the
agency
is
bound
by
a
rule
of
reason
and
the
reviewing
court
is
bound
by
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard.
i
thank
the
court
for
its
attention.
