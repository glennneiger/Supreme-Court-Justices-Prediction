mr.
fried,
may
i
inquire
of
you?
the
statutory
language
of
nepa
says
that
the
agency
has
to
describe
in
detail
the
adverse
environmental
effects
which
can't
be
avoided.
now,
in
this
case
do
you
think
that
a
mere
listing
of
possible
mitigating
measures
without
any
consideration
or
discussion
of
how
they
might
be
employed
would
suffice
to
meet
that
statutory
language?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
fact,
no
detail,
wouldn't
you
agree--
unknown
speaker
--well,
the,
the,
the
point
i'm
just
trying
to
make
is
is
it
enough
in
your
view
to
just
list
possible
mitigating
actions
as
a
list
without
in
any
way
attempting
to
say
this
one
could
be
successful,
we
think
it
will
be,
it
will
do
thus
and
so.
do
you
have
to
go
beyond
just
a
mere
sketchy
little
list?
unknown
speaker
xxx
point
it's
just
this
is
so
insignificant
they
didn't
have
to
do
it?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
that
we're
in...
that
the
circuit
court
and
the
district
court
are
in
the
same
position?
the
circuit
court
doesn't
defer
to
the
district
court.
they
each
engage
in
the
same
kind
of
review?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
establish...
what
facts
do
you
establish
to
determine
that
a...
that
a
statement
is
or
is
not
complete?
unknown
speaker
well,
i...
i
was
concerned
about
that
because
in...
in
the
marsh
case
involving
the
elk
creek
dam,
the
court
made
findings
that
the
government
was
continuing
to
study
wildlife
mitigation.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
record
is
either
closed
or
it
isn't
closed.
unknown
speaker
should
we
then
discount
the
statement
in
footnote
9
by
the
district
court
that
the
agency
is
continuing
to
look
at
mitigation
matters?
unknown
speaker
but
the
district
court
cited
that
to
show
that
the...
nepa
was
being
complied
with,
and
i...
i
take
it
you
would
agree
that
nepa
is
compiled
with
or
not
based
on
what's
contained
in
the
eis.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
we
were
talking
about
tiering,
so-called,
or
phasing.
unknown
speaker
does
the
master
plan
require
an
eis?
unknown
speaker
it
would
seem
to
me
we
would
have
to
know
that
with
some
certainty
before
we
could
analyze
the
tiering
argument.
unknown
speaker
general
fried,
supposing
the
government
here
in
each
of
these
cases
had
fully
recited
all
the
possible
mitigating
factors
and
that
without
committing
itself
to
any
of
them,
would
that
have
satisfied
the
ninth
circuit,
do
you
think?
unknown
speaker
there
is
language
in
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
that
suggests
they
would
not
be
satisfied.
unknown
speaker
general
fried,
can
i
get
you
back
to
the
provision,
what
is
subsection
2
of,
of
nepa
which
says
that
you
have
to
identify
the
environmental
effects
that
cannot
be
mitigated?
it
does
say
that,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
i,
i
can
understand
if,
if,
if
you're
willing
to
connect
the
nepa
statement
with
the
action
that
the
agency
takes,
sort
of
fuse
the
two
together,
i
suppose
it
would
be
reasonable
for
an
agency
to
say
we
don't
know
whether
these
effects
can
be
mitigated
or
not,
to
tell
you
the
truth,
but
it
doesn't
matter
because
even
if
they
can't,
we
think
this
project
is
worth
it...
50
black-tailed
deer
or
whatever.
unknown
speaker
now,
if
you
connect
the
two,
that
is
a
sensible
judgment.
but
you're
telling
us,
no,
you
have
to...
nepa
has
nothing
to
do
with,
with
the
decision.
nepa
is
simply
a...
a
study
in
and
of
itself.
once
you
do
that,
it
seems
to
me
you
got
to
give
the
language
its
literal
effects
don't
you?
it
says
identify
those
effects
that
can't
be
mitigated.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
let's
say
the
substantial
effects
that
can't
be
mitigated.
let's,
let's
take
the
ski
lodge
case
rather
than
the
dam
case.
there
were
some
substantial
effects,
and
the
agency
really
didn't
say
whether
they
could
be
mitigated.
they
say
here
are
some
possibilities
for
mitigation.
they
didn't
say
whether
the
possibilities
would
work.
they
didn't
say
whether
anyone
would,
would...
some
of
them
would
have
to
be
undertaken
by
the
county
or
by
the
state.
they
just
said
here
are
some
possibilities.
unknown
speaker
now,
why
is
that
adequate?
unknown
speaker
i'm
a
little
puzzled
by
that
argument,
mr.
solicitor
general.
is
it
not
possible
in
one
of
those
permit
situations
to
say
that
a
permit
would
be
granted,
conditional
on
the
permittee
having
the
third
party
take
the
action
that
would
be
essential?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
mean...
you
mean
if
the
ski
run
would
bring
5,000
people
to
the
area,
and
those
people
would
cause
air
quality
problem
because
of
their
cabins
in
the
city
or
in
the...
in
the
municipality,
then
the
government
doesn't
refer
to
that
as
an
adverse
environmental
consequence?
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
required
to
under
the
statute,
isn't
it?
any
adverse
environmental
effect.
unknown
speaker
before
you
go,
may
i
ask
you
would
you...
would
you
be
willing
to...
to
have
an,
an
environmental
impact
statement
evaluated
in
tandem
with
the
decision
that
is
based
upon
it?
i
frankly
have
a
lot
of
difficulty
deciding
whether
an
eis
is
adequate
without
knowing
what
decision
was,
was,
based
on
that.
for
example,
on
the
point
of
identifying
those
effects
that
cannot
be
mitigated,
if
the
agency's
final
decision
says,
even
assuming
that
all
of
these
possibilities
for
mitigation
never...
never
come
to
fruition,
even
assuming
that
all
of
these
effects
are
non-mitigable,
we
still
think
it's
worth
doing
this,
then,
then
i
would
really
have
no
quibble
with
the
eis.
the,
the
agency
has
directed
its
attention
to
the
problem
and
says
we're
willing
to
go
ahead
anyway.
unknown
speaker
whereas,
if
the
agency's
decision
is
on
the
assumption
that
the
counties
are
going
to
do
this
thing
and
the
state
are
going
to
do
the
other
thing,
this
seems
to
us
a
reasonable
thing
to
do,
then,
then
that
environmental
impact
statement
looks
to
me
like
a
bad
one.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
general
fried.
mr.
bricklin,
we'll
hear
from
you
now.
unknown
speaker
did
congress
impose
a
requirement
that
a...
that,
that
an
agency
commit
itself
to
a,
a...
operating
a...
in
a
certain
way
so
as
to
mitigate?
unknown
speaker
don't
you
think
there's
language
in
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
that
suggests
the
contrary?
or--
unknown
speaker
--so,
you,
you
don't
support
the,
the...
what
you
regard
as
the
dicta,
but
you
say
the
result
is
nonetheless--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
bricklin,
in
the...
in
the
ski
resort
case,
how,
how
would
you
have
had
the...
the
government
do
the
job
right
with
respect
to
those
environmental
effects
that
they
say
could
only
be
mitigated
by
counties
or
states?
what,
what
was
the
government
supposed
to
do
to
decide
whether
that
mitigation
would
occur
or
not?
unknown
speaker
what
about
air
quality?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
see.
is,
is
your
complaint
only
that
they
were...
that
they
erroneously
said
that
mitigation
could
produce
compliance
with
the
air
standards?
i
thought
your
complaint
was
even
if
it
could,
we
have
no
assurance
that
mitigation
will
occur.
you're
not
complaining
about
the
latter?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
it
was...
i
thought
it
was
part
of
your
case
really,
that,
that
the
federal
government
just
said,
well,
if
somebody
wants
to
take
care
of
these
problems,
they
can.
there
are
ways
to
do
it.
unknown
speaker
and,
and,
and
your
response
is,
well,
that
may
be,
but
how
do
we
know
they're
going
to
do
it.
and
it
isn't
responsible
to
make
a
decision
unless
you
know
somebody
is
going
to
mitigate.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
what
you
mean
by
substantive
review.
i
thought
we
did
not
substantively
review
for
excessive
environmental
impact.
i
thought
that
as
long
as
the
agency
says
we're
willing
to
do
it,
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
where,
where
is
the
substantive
requirement
not
to
harm
the
environment?
unknown
speaker
with
respect
to
those
things
that
the
law
forbids
them
from
doing.
what
supports
the
proposition
that
if
they
really
do
something
which
someone
might
regard
as
arbitrary
in
going
ahead
in
spite
of
an
eis,
that's
subject
to
review
under
the
apa?
unknown
speaker
depending
on
applicable
law
governing
substantive
matters,
and
the
nepa
is
not
a
law
governing
substantive
matters.
unknown
speaker
is...
isn't
the...
isn't
the
requirement
of
reasonableness...
does...
doesn't
that
lay
some
ground
for
thinking
that
remote
effects
may
be
discussed
with
less
precision
and
detail
than
immediate
effects?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
do
you
defend
the
ninth
circuit's
conclusion
that
the
ceq's
rescinded
worst
case
regulations
are,
in
effect,
still
in
effect?
unknown
speaker
how
does
one
know
whether
there's
uncertainty?
unknown
speaker
it
came
to
light
after
the
closing
of
the
administrative
record,
in
effect?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
another
question
is
when
are
these
things
over?
i
mean,
when,
when
do
you
decide
them?
because
someone
can
always
bring
new
information
to
light
and
you
can
just
have
a
great
big
paper
shuffling
operation
where
nothing
is
ever
decided
finally.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
does
that
mean
to
say
it
came
to
say
it
came
to
light
in
time
for
the
army
corps
to
use
it
in
a
meaningful
manner?
unknown
speaker
but
doesn't
something
depend
on
when
this
information
came
to
light
in
view
of
the
litigation
and
the,
the
state
of
the
administrative
record?
i
mean,
supposing
the
day
of
the
hearing
in
the
court
of
appeals
someone
says,
look,
i've
got
new
information
here,
does
that
start
the
clock
running
all
over
again?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
asking
you
a
question.
i
hope
you'll
answer.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
bricklin,
did
the
army
corps
decide
that
the
new
information
was
not
significant
enough
in
its
view
to
warrant
a
supplement
to
the
eis?
unknown
speaker
of
the
rogue?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
bricklin,
the
army
corps
decided
not
to
prepare
a
supplement.
and
why?
it
decided
it
because
it
didn't
believe
the
accuracy
of
the
new
studies?
unknown
speaker
or
they
didn't
think
that
it
was
significant
because
it
was
inaccurate,
or
what?
unknown
speaker
on
what
standard
of
review
should
a
court
review
that
determination
by
the
corps?
should
it
be
on
a
reasonableness
standard
or
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard?
unknown
speaker
and
is
there
a
difference?
unknown
speaker
well,
generally
doesn't
the
apa
contemplate
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard
of
review?
unknown
speaker
would
a
determination
of
whether
a
study
is
accurate
be
a
factual
determination?
unknown
speaker
so,
the
standard
would
be
arbitrary
and
capricious
under
aba...
apa.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
what
we
have
to
decide
here,
whether
that's
proper
or
whether
we
go
back
to
the
apa
for
the
standard?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bricklin,
do
you
agree
with
the
ninth
circuit
that
the
forest
service
has
to
develop
an
adequate
mitigation
plan
before
it
can
issue
a
special
use
permit,
as
in
the
ski
resort
case?
unknown
speaker
but
didn't
the
agency
interpret
those
regulations
in
doing
what
it
did?
unknown
speaker
so,
presumably
it
thought
it
was
complying
with
its
regulations.
unknown
speaker
and
some
deference
is
given
to
the
agency
when
they're
interpreting
their
own
regulations.
unknown
speaker
is
it
clear
that
the
special
or
that
the
master
plan
is
going
to
be
presented
to
the
united
states
government,
to
the
forest
service,
in
the
ski
run
case?
unknown
speaker
does,
does
the
permit
that
was
granted
now
allow
any
actual
construction
or
site
clearing?
unknown
speaker
that
awaits
the
master
plan?
unknown
speaker
isn't
it
the
government's
position
that
until
they
see
the
actual
contours
of
the
construction,
they
can't
really
evaluate
mitigation
matters...
measures
and
that
they're
much
better
off
simply
waiting
for
the
master
plan
stage
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
you,
you
don't
disagree
that...
that
the
detail
of
the
statement
has
to
be
commensurate
with
the
severity
of
the
harm.
i
mean,
you
wouldn't
require
any
statement
to
be
made
about...
how
many
acres
was
it?
eighteen
hundred
acres
flooded?
you
wouldn't
require
them
to
say
so
many
million
ants
will
be...
will
be
killed.
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn't
require
anything
at
all.
unknown
speaker
so,
there
is
some
relationship
between--
unknown
speaker
--how
serious
and...
and
whether
you
have
to
say
anything
at
all.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
bricklin.
general
fried,
you
have
seven
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
mr.
fried,
just
to
help
me
a
little
bit,
did
they
find
it
unreliable
with
respect
to
the
precise
point
your
opponent
made
about
the
two-month
delay
in
hatching
the
eggs?
unknown
speaker
he
said
they
made
a
lot
of
other
criticisms,
but
that
one
was
quite
important
and
was
accepted
by
everybody.
unknown
speaker
it
sounds
pretty
important.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
it
wouldn't...
it
wouldn't
harm
the
fish
to
be
hatched
in
winter
instead
of
spring?
unknown
speaker
that
seems
to
be
what
you're
saying,
if
i
understand
you.
unknown
speaker
he
said
there
was
no
dispute
on
this,
and
i
just
don't
know
whether
i
should
believe
him
or
you.
unknown
speaker
or
whether
it's
significant.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
i
think
under
your
proposed
disposition,
you
do
suggest
there
be
further
proceedings
before
the
agency.
unknown
speaker
there
will
be...
the
record
will
be
reopened.
unknown
speaker
it's
curious
you
should
say
rule
of
reason
instead
of
rule
of
arbitrary,
capricious...
or
rule
of
arbitrariness
or
capriciousness.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
difference
between
the
two
really?
unknown
speaker
i
think
you
said
a
rule
of
reason.
unknown
speaker
we're
only
talking
here
about
the
reviewing
court.
