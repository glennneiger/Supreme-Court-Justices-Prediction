unknown
speaker
you
may
proceed,
mr.
graybill.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
i
don't
understand
what
this
has
to
do
with
preventing
a
party
central
committee
from
making
a
recommendation
to
the
party
membership.
unknown
speaker
well,
couldn't
they
participate
with
the
recommendation
as
well?
i
mean,
they
are
just
talking
about
the
right
to
know
what
the
recommendation
of
the
committee
as
a
committee
is.
then
they'll
be
able
to
accept
it
or
reject
it.
why
is
that
undemocratic?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
another
case.
you
don't
want
this
case
to
hinge
on
whether
it
would
be
constitutional
to
prevent
election
returns
from
being
announced
in
california,
assuming
that
they
are
available?
unknown
speaker
it's
one
thing
to
outlaw
the
smoke-filled
room
and
it's
another
thing
to
prevent
me
from
knowing
what
the
people
in
the
smoke-filled
room
would
recommend.
isn't
that
something
quite
different?
unknown
speaker
so
you're
saying
we
should
validate
it
because
it
isn't
needed?
i
don't
understand
that.
you
say
it's
minuscule,
you
can
find
out
other
ways,
so
it's
really
not
important.
unknown
speaker
and
so
you're
here
at
the
supreme
court
to
defend
it
because
it's
not
important?
i
don't
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
didn't
the
party,
the
democratic
party,
change
its
by-laws
or
requirements
after
the
ninth
circuit
acted
here
to
permit
pre-primary
endorsements
by
the
committee?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
was
it
an
effective
vote?
are
you
denying
that
it
was
an
effective
vote,
binding
on
the
committee?
unknown
speaker
it
was
permissible.
so
once
again
you're,
you're
trying
to
impose
upon
the
party
some
other
rule
about
what,
what
the...
how
the
party
takes
action.
if
the
democratic
party
of
california
says
32
votes
does
it
in
those
circumstances,
32
votes
does
it,
and
you're
coming
and
tell
us
that
it
doesn't
do
it?
unknown
speaker
including
those
who
voted
for
this
bill.
weren't
they
all
party
people?
unknown
speaker
weren't
they
all
party
people
in
the
legislature?
unknown
speaker
the
law
involved
in
this
case
passed
by
the
legislature
of
california,
which
legislature
was
composed
of
politicians.
do
you
agree
to
that?
unknown
speaker
how
can
you
say
it's
a
minimal
restriction.
it's
a,
it's
a
core
right
to
express
views
in
the
political
arena.
i
mean,
i
just,
i
really
don't
understand
your
terminology.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
party
mechanism
permits
the
committee
to
express
its
views,
for
whatever
it's
worth,
how
can
that
be
some
minimal
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
was
the
will
of
the
party
before
the
amendment?
unknown
speaker
that's
a
real
bootstrap,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
if
the
by-laws
were
wholly
silent,
they
certainly
didn't
forbid
endorsing
candidates.
unknown
speaker
it
still
was
just
as
much
of
a,
just
as
much
of
a
restriction
on
the
speech,
no
matter
what
the
by-laws
said,
unless
the
by-laws
absolutely
forbade
it,
which
it
didn't...
they
didn't.
unknown
speaker
well,
apparently
the
county
and
state
central
committees...
who
brought
this
lawsuit?
unknown
speaker
well,
there,
at
least
there
are
some
county
or
state
central
committees
that
want
endorsements.
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
libertarian
party?
are
they
on
the
primary
ballot
in
california?
unknown
speaker
do
they
permit
pre-primary
endorsements?
unknown
speaker
does
that
party
permit
pre-primary
endorsements?
unknown
speaker
well,
because
they
had
to
change
their
whole
system
once
they
became
ballot-qualified.
they
also
changed
their
whole
manner
of
electing
delegates
and
went
to
a
county
system
instead
of
a
regional
system,
right?
i
mean,
that
doesn't
prove
anything.
it
just
proves
that
they've
been
obeying
the
law.
unknown
speaker
to
be
exempt,
how
do
you
request
to
be
exempted,
i
mean?
is
this
the
way
you
do
things
in
california,
there's
a
law
and
you
just
go
and
ask
for
an
exemption?
sure.
or
is
there
a
special
procedure
to
get
an
exemption
from
this?
unknown
speaker
oh,
you
think
the
libertarian
party
is
in
the
same
position
in
california,
just
go
to
a
friendly
legislature
and
say
we
want
to
do
something
that
we
think
will
make
us
a
more
effective
party.
unknown
speaker
xxx...
would
they
have
to
get
an
exemption
from
or
an
exception
or
whatever
it
is,
from
the
ban
on
endorsing
candidates?
where
would
they
have
to
go
to
get
that?
unknown
speaker
and
that's
true,
is
it,
also,
of
the
provision
of
the
statute,
as
i
understand,
that
specifies
the
membership
of
the
state
central
committee?
unknown
speaker
you'd
have
to
go
to
the
legislature
to
get
an
exception
from
that,
too?
unknown
speaker
and
the
provision
fixing
the
term
of
office
of
the
state
committee
chairs,
that's
in
the
statute,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
there,
too,
they'd
have
to
get
an
exception
from
the
legislature,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
forgive
me
for--
unknown
speaker
--you
do
agree
that
each
of
those
prohibitions
raises
a
first
amendment
question,
don't
you,
either
speech
or
association
or
both?
unknown
speaker
i
know
that.
i
know
that's
your
position,
but
i
just
wanted
to
be
clear.
it's
all
four
of
those
that
you
say
implicate
the
first
amendment.
unknown
speaker
xxx...
parties
to
endorse.
any
party
that
doesn't
want
to
endorse
just
won't
endorse.
if
that's
good
for
the
party
and
good
for
the
pubic
interest,
they
just
won't
endorse.
unknown
speaker
well,
somebody
else
can
organize
a
vote
of
45
members
and
overrule
that.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
all,
all
the
32
members
managed
to
get
done
is
that
they
said
that
there
may
be
endorsements.
it
didn't
force
anybody
to
endorse.
no
county
commission
has
to
endorse.
the
state
committee
doesn't
have
to
endorse.
there's
just
a
permission
now,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
a
system,
but
did
every,
did
every
county
central
committee
have
to
make
endorsements
under
that
by-law?
they
didn't
need
to?
unknown
speaker
well,
regional
then.
unknown
speaker
if
those
party
central
committees
had
voted
differently,
they
would
have
been
voting
to
violate
the
law,
right?
so
you're
saying
that
the
fact
that
the
parties
have
not
put
into
effect
a
mechanism
that
violates
the
law
proves
that
the
parties
don't
want
it,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
unknown
speaker
it's
only
implementing
them.
unknown
speaker
you're
suggesting
that
they
should
have
adopted
by-laws
that
they
knew
could
not
be
implemented
because
they'd
be
unlawful.
unknown
speaker
i'm
sorry,
mr.
brosnahan.
did
you
say
new
jersey
has
the
same
thing?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
have
to
do
to
get
out
of
it,
mr.
brosnahan?
is
there
no
way
of
getting
out
of
it
once
you're,
once
you're
on
the
ballot,
once
you're
a
ballot-qualified
party?
unknown
speaker
okay.
so
it's
not
a
matter
of
saying,
well,
i
just
won't,
i
just
won't
have
a
primary
then.
you
have
to
have
a
primary.
you
have
no
choice
about
being
in
the
primary
as
a
party,
right?
unknown
speaker
this
law
doesn't
prevent
individual
members
of
the
central
committee
from
going
around
campaigning
for
certain
people?
unknown
speaker
or
even...
can
they
organize
within
the
committee,
like
committee
for
john
jones,
made
up
of
just
members
of
the
central
committee?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
no,
they
don't
represent
anything.
they
just...
except
that
everybody
knows
they're
members
of
the
central
committee.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
suppose
anybody's
been
put
in
jail
under
this.
unknown
speaker
was
there,
was
there
a
challenge
to
the
selection
of
the
country
central
committees?
unknown
speaker
in
this
lawsuit?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
are
other
california
regulations
and
requirements
at
issue
here
in
addition
to
the
pre-primary
endorsement
issue.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
a
fairly
common
sort
of
statute
in
the
states
around
the
country?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
didn't
this
court's
decision
in
chaney
uphold
some
sort
of
state
regulation
of
who
serves
on
the
state
committee?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
though
it
was
a
statute
requiring
each
major
party
to
have
a
state
committee
consisting
of
two
people
from
each
county.
unknown
speaker
and
the
court
said
that
the
state's
interest
was
unquestionably
legitimate.
unknown
speaker
and
that
a
substantial
regulation
of
elections
is
to
be
expected
and
upheld.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
california
statute
requires
alternating
every
two
years--
unknown
speaker
--between
northern
and
southern
california.
of
course,
there's
kind
of
unstated
warfare
in
that
state
between
the
north
and
the
south.
do
you
think
the
state--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
recall
what
the,
what
the
consequence
was
in
chaney?
could
you
get
off
the
ballot?
was
the
consequence
if
you
didn't
comply
with
this,
with
this
manner
of
forming
your
party
that
you
simply
couldn't,
couldn't
have
the
state
fund
a
primary
for
you?
or
did
you
have
to
be
in
the
primary?
you
see,
that
makes
some
difference
to
me.
it
seems
to
me
the
state
can
attach
some,
some
conditions,
perhaps,
to
paying
for
your
primary.
but
you're
talking--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
brosnahan,
haven't
we
crossed
the
bridge,
though,
when
we've
permitted
the
states
to
require
parties
to
select
their
leaders
by
primary?
i
mean,
suppose
the
libertarian
party
says
we
like
the
smoke-filled
room.
we
really
don't
think
the
way...
and
they
take
a
vote
democratically,
and
99
percent
of
all
of
their
members
would
rather
not
have
a
primary;
they
would
rather
have
the
party
leaders
meet
in
a
smoke-filled
room;
they
know
more
about
it,
i
don't
trust
my
judgment
as
much
as
i
do
theirs.
and
yet,
we've
said,
we've
said
the
states
can
say
to
a
party,
you
cannot
pick
your
leaders
that
way;
we'll
tell
you
how
to
pick
your
leaders,
your
candidates.
you
pick
them
through
a
primary.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
that.
but
you
tell
me
where's
the
line.
why
can
a
state
say
that
and
yet
not
say
what
it
said
here,
that
you
have
to
have
some--
unknown
speaker
--how
your
delegates
are
going
to
be
distributed
geographically
and
all
sorts
of
other
things.
where's
the
line?
unknown
speaker
well,
anyway,
i
gather
wigoda
said
that
a
state
could
not
tell
a
national
party
who
was
to
be
seated
for
the
state--
unknown
speaker
--at
its
national
convention.
unknown
speaker
that
goes
rather
far,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
view
that
any
limit
on
the
term
of
the
party
chairman
is
unconstitutional,
or
i
take
it
the
compelling
interest
standard
applies
and
we,
we...
could
the
state
limit
the
term
to,
say,
ten
years?
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
state--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
think
the
state
could
just
prevent
access
to
the
ballot
by
a
party
and
just
say
candidates
and
wouldn't
say
they
are
democratic
or
democrats
or
republicans
or
anything
like
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
it's
done.
how
about
in
so-called
partisan
elections?
i
don't
suppose
the
parties
can
force
their
way
onto
a
state
run
election
ballot,
can
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
state
doesn't,
doesn't
provide
for
qualifying.
they
just
say
you
can
have...
political
parties
are
legal,
but
they
don't
go
on
the
ballot
as...
their
candidates
don't
go
on
the
ballot
as
party
candidates.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
brosnahan.
you
have
two
minutes,
mr.
graybill.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
sanction,
then,
against,
against
the
county
committees
violating
the
prohibition
of
endorsement?
unknown
speaker
so
the
only
thing
that
could
happen
to
you
if
you
violate
it
is
you
get
an
injunction.
unknown
speaker
yes.
i
have
made
the
same
mistake
before,
so
don't
worry.
unknown
speaker
your
time
has
expired.
