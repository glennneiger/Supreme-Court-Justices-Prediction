mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
thank
you,
justice
brennan,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
after
remand
from
this
court
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
its
decision
last
term
in
tashjian
v.
the
republican
party
of
connecticut.
the
primary
question
presented
is
whether
california
can,
consistent
with
the
first
amendment,
protect
the
right
of
members
of
a
state
political
party
to
control
their
party
through
their
votes
in
the
primary
election
conducted
and
financed
by
the
state.
one
of
the
challenged
statutes
enables
party
members
to
use
the
primary
election
to
choose
democratically
the
candidates
who
have
the
endorsement
of
the
party
in
the
general
election
for
partisan
office,
and
another
set
of
challenged
statutes
enables
the
endorsed
candidates
as
the
chosen
representatives
of
the
party
to
be
members
of
the
party
state
central
committee.
and
this
afternoon
i'd
like
to
address
two
general
points.
the
first
is
that
the
invalidated
statutes
promote
strong
and
fundamental
california
interests
in
establishing
a
thoroughly
open
and
democratic
process
for
selecting
its
public
officials;
and
the
separate
but
related
interest
of
establishing
government
which
is
stable
and
has
the
acceptance
of
its
citizens.
and
the
final
interest
is
in
the
prevention
of
fraud.
and
the
second
general
notion
that
we'd
like
to
address
is
that
on
the
record
below,
the
invalidation
of
the
statutes
violates
this
court's
admonition,
repeated
most
recently
in
tashjian,
that
a
court
should
not
interfere
with
the
first
amendment
rights,
the
expression
of
first
amendment
rights
merely
because
it
believes
them
to
be
unwise
or
irrational.
now,
california's
overriding
and
fundamental
interest
in
these
statutes
is
in
an
open
and
democratic
system
of
selecting
its
government
officials,
and
this
interest
reflects
the
evolution
of
values
manifested
by
the
amendments
to
the
united
states
constitution
and
decisions
of
this
court
and
of
california's
own
constitution
which
expand
the
franchise
and
permit
more
direct
participation
by
the
citizens
of
this
country
in
the
selection
of
their
officers
and
the
determination
of
policy.
some
of
those
constitutional
amendments
that
reflect
this
value
are
the
elimination
of
the
disenfranchise
of
black
persons
in
this
country
by
the
fifteenth
amendment,
the
direct
election
of
united
states
senators
and
the
extension
of
the
vote
to
women.
and
court...
decisions
of
this
court
of
a
general
nature
which
reflect
this
are
the
decisions
affecting
one
person,
on
vote
and
the
restrictions
on
gerrymandering.
and
the
california
constitution--
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
--the...
justice
scalia,
it
does
not
prevent
the
members
of
the
committee
from
communicating
with
their
party.
what
it
does
is
protect
to
the
members
of
the
party
the
right
to
participate
directly
in
the
choice
of
candidates
without
having
that--
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
--well,
justice
scalia,
the
choice,
the
representation
being
made
on
behalf
of
the
committee
is
typically
that
this
is
the
party's
candidate,
and
the
effect
that
that
can
often
have
is
that
the
choices
available
to
the
rest
of
the
members
of
the
party
in
the
primary
election
are
restricted.
we
have
a
phenomenon
in
california
that's
caused
a
great
deal
of
irritation,
the
election
returns
on
the
national
level
are
reported
before
our
polls
close,
and
it's
been
established
by
objective
evidence
that
that
affects
the
turnout
in
elections.
and
we
don't
get
the
participation
of
as
many
citizens
in
our
election
process
when
they
think
that
their
options
have
been
foreclosed,
that
it's
over.
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
no,
justice
scalia.
what
we
are
attempting
to
demonstrate
by
that
analogy
is
that
the
tendency
for
an
endorsement
by
what
purports
to
be
the
party,
and
in
california
in
fact
is
not
the
party,
the
party
expresses
itself
in
the
primary
election.
that's
what
the
primary
election
system
is
all
about.
the
party
leaders--
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
--that
doesn't
prevent
you,
justice
scalia,
from
knowing
what
the
people
in
the
smoke-filled
room
recommend.
they
have
other
means
of
access
through,
for
example,
membership
in
the
california
democratic
council,
our
declarant,
senator
rodda,
indicated
any
number
of
unofficial
groups
of
party
that
get
together
and
make
their
views
known
to
the
electorate.
this
restriction
is
so
minuscule
with
regard
to
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
individual
members
of
the
executive
committees
or
the
county
central
committees
or
the
state
central
committees,
the
means
available
to
them
other
than
creating
the
false
impression
that
they
speak
for
the
party
are
readily
available.
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
well,
it
is
important,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
well,
that
is
definitely
not
the
case,
and
the
reason
it
is
important
is
that
in
california,
in
the
direct
primary
system,
the
party,
per
se,
speaks
by
its
vote
in
the
primary
election.
when
an
official
organ
of
the
party,
which
under
the
charter
of
the
party,
which
is
reflected
in
these
statutes,
precludes
them
from
making
those
endorsements,
you
have
not
only
the
mandate
of
the
party
that
created
these
committees
that
these
committees
not
try
to
speak
for
the
party
or
to
restrict
the
numbers
of
candidates
and
options
available
to
the
party
in
the
primary
election
is
a
justifiable
and
overriding
state
interest,
and
it
is
narrowly
construed
to...
it
is
narrowly
fashioned
not
to
infringe
on
the
first
amendment
rights
of
individual
party
leaders
to
express
their
views.
they
are
just
restricted
from
committing
the
fraud
that
exists
by
virtue
of
the
existence
of
the
california
democratic...
the
california
primary
election
system.
the
parties
speak
at
the
primary
with
regard
to
who
their
endorsed
candidates
are
to
be
for
the
general
election
and
who
the
party
leadership
is
to
be.
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
justice
o'connor.
i
think
we
should
be
more
precise
there.
the
executive
board
of
the
state
central
committee
of
the
democratic
party,
by
a
vote
which
is
not
clear
but
could
have
been
as
few
as
32
out
of
over
1000
members,
decided
that
matter.
they
did
not
present
it
to
a
vote
of
the
full
committee
as
was
the
case
in
tashjian,
and
we
really
don't
know
what
the
position
of
the
party
is
on
that.
i
don't
think
that
would
be
a
fair
reflection--
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
--under
the
by-laws,
justice
scalia,
as
we
understand
them
of
the
state
central
committee,
that
would
be
permissible,
yes.
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
no,
your
honor.
what
we
are
explicating
here
is
that
does
not
reflect
the
will
of
the
party
necessarily.
there
is
a
process
that
has
been
gone
through
to
establish
these
reforms
through
the
political
process.
in
other
words,
interest
in
the
parties,
one
of
their
parties
organized
through
the
direct
primary
system,
the
progressives,
the
much
maligned
progressives,
they
established
those
things
in
statute.
the
members
of
the
party
here
that
disagree
have
been
unsuccessful
in
persuading
their
parties
in
general,
and
i
think
we
have
to
look
here
that
the
organization
of
a
party
is
not
the
party,
per
se.
there
are
other
elements
to
it.
there
are
the,
the
members
of
the
party
elected
to
the
official
positions
in
state
government
and
in
the
national
legislature--
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
--you
mean
the
by-laws?
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
are
you
referring
to
the
by-law
change
or
some
legislation,
justice
marshall?
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
well,
i
think
that
that's
correct,
justice
marshall.
i
think
we're,
we're
dealing
with
politicians
throughout
this
lawsuit.
the
overriding
interest
that
california
has
in
imposing
this
kind
of
minimal
restriction
on
the
speech
of
an
entity
as
opposed--
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
--justice
o'connor,
the
committee
purports
to
speak
for
those,
for
others
that
are
not
members
of
the
committee
and
that
they
were
elected--
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
--justice
o'connor,
it
would
still
remain
our
contention
at
this
point
that
the
change
in
the
by-laws
is
not
necessarily
reflective
of
the
will
of
the
party.
it
appears...
and
we
have
to
acknowledge
that
under
the
circumstances
that
this
case
has
gotten
here,
the
record
isn't
as
complete
as
we
would
like,
but
we
believe
that
the
mechanism
of
a
change
in
the
by-laws
and
a
submission
to
the
legislature
which
determines...
these
are
people
that
were
nominated
by
members
of
the
party
in
the
primary
election
and
elected...
make
a
determination
of
whether
this
really
is
reflective
of
the
will
of
the
party.
and
there
is
an
example--
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
--the
amendment
to
the
by-laws,
justice
white?
the
will
of
the
party,
we
believe,
was
reflected
in
the
statute
because
this
process--
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
--well,
perhaps,
but--
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
--well,
justice
white--
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
--your
honor,
we
have
referred
in
the
record
and
established
in
the
record,
and
i
don't
think
it's
rebutted
here,
that
the
political
culture
of
california,
the
expression
of
first
amendment
rights
by
the
parties
themselves
indicates
that
they
don't
want
their
institutions
making
endorsements,
and
this
goes
back
before
the
advent
of
the
primary
election
system.
this
was
the
way
californians
did
business
in
the
convention
era,
as
was
reflected
in
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general--
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
--well,
there
are
three
parties
affected
in
this,
political
parties.
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
there
are
no
republican
central
committees
that
want
to
endorse--
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
--yes,
i
believe
they
are,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
do
their
by-laws
prevent
pre-primary--
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
--your
honor,
the
only
indication
in
the
record
below
is
that
they
do
not,
they
have
not,
in
fact,
made
those
endorsements
since
they've
become
a
ballot-qualified
party.
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
well,
justice
scalia,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
below
that
indicates
that
the
libertarian
party
requested
to
be
exempted
from
the
ban
on
endorsements.
that's
nothing
below,
outside
of
the
fact
that
the
state--
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
--there
are
amendments
to
laws
submitted
to
the
legislature
every
session,
justice
scalia,
and
this
would
be
one
of
them.
this
is
traditionally
the
way
that
the
parties,
especially
the
democratic
and
republican
parties
in
california,
have
done
business.
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record,
justice
scalia,
that
indicates
they
went
to
the
legislature
to
request
any
kind
of
an
exemption
from
that
ban;
every
indication,
when
you
look
at
their
by-laws,
their...
it's
true,
there's
no
mention
one
way
or
the
other
with
respect
to
the
ban
on
endorsements,
but
they
in
fact
did
not,
and
there
would
have
been
nothing
to
prevent
them
from
having
unofficial
groups
such
as
within
the...
historically
within
the
democratic
party,
there's
the
california
democratic
council,
and
within
the
republican
party
the
california
republican
assembly,
which--
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
--they
would
go
to
the
legislature,
justice
brennan.
or
they
could
use
the
initiative
process.
and--
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
that's
correct.
but--
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
--yes,
it
is,
justice
brennan.
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
that's
true.
but,
justice
brennan,
one
of
the
things
that
we'd
like
to
point
out
to
the
court--
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
--yes.
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
your
honor,
they
may
raise
them,
but
they
do
not
establish
a
substantial
infringement
of
those
interests.
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
i
believe
they
do,
justice
brennan.
our,
our
position
is
that
the
political
parties...
and
i
believe
this
is
the
primary
elec...
the
election
of
party
officials
and
the
endorsed
candidates
of
the
parties
are
affected
in
the
primary
election,
which
is
an
integral
part
of
the
state's
election
process,
and
the
importance
to
the
state
of
assuring
that
those
institutions
that
participate,
do
participate
in
a
democratic
manner
and
enable
the
grass
roots
to
make
direct
input
without
being
restricted
by
party
organizations,
machines,
bosses,
and
smoke-filled
rooms
is
a
very
deep-seated
tradition
in
california.
it's
one
that
has
been
expressed
by
the
members
of
the
parties
themselves.
that
is
a
first
amendment
right.
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
well,
justice
white,
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
who
decides
for
the
party,
the
members
of
the
party
or
some
organization
that,
or
group,
special
interest,
that
manages
to
collect
32
votes
on
the
executive
board
and
not
allow
that
matter
to
come
up
for
a
vote
of
the
full
committee.
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
i
think
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
your
honor,
the
opportunity
was
in
january
of
this
year,
and
the
convention
occurred
in
march.
there's,
as
i
understand
it,
under
the
rules
there
would
be
no
opportunity
for
anybody
to
override
in
those
circumstances.
what
should
happen
is
that
these
by-laws
would
go
to
the
legislature
and
they
would
be
evaluated
by
members
of
the
party
who
would
determine
whether
it
does
in
fact
reflect--
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
--well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
there
was
a
system
for
making
these
endorsements
that
the
party
chair
made
sure
went
forward.
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
justice
white,
they're
not
permitted
to
as
county
central
committees,
per
se.
there
is
a
regional
system,
so
the
plaintiffs
before
this
court--
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
--still
do
not
have
the
permission
of
their
parties
to
make
endorsements.
they
are
precluded,
and
if
we're
to
take
the
action
of
the
parties,
the
action
of
the
state
central
committees
as
being
reflective
of
the
will
of
the
party,
then
these
plaintiffs
have
not
shown
a
substantial
infringement
on
their
rights
by
the
restriction
of
this
statute
because
they
are--
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
--justice
scalia,
justice
scalia,
at
any
time
during
the
course
of
this
litigation,
a
party
could
have
passed
by-laws.
the
passing
of
by-laws
that
says
we
want
the
right
to
endorse,
and
this
is
how
we're
going
to
do
it,
does
not
violate
any
statute
that
is
before
this
court.
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
well,
its--
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
--well,
the
way
the
parties
have
done
business
is,
it
appears,
is
that
that
is
what
happens.
there
is
a
decision
by
the
organization,
and
it
goes
to
the
legislature,
and
the
delegation...
and
there's
a
comity
relationship
in
the
state
legislature
which
we
have
established
in
the
record
through
senator
rodda's
declaration
that
one
party
historically
and
consistently
has
not
interfered
with
the
way
another
party
wants
to
organize
itself,
and
this
ban
on
endorsements
has
been
the
consistent
policy
for
over
75
years
of
both
the
democratic
and
republican
parties
in
california,
and
there's
nothing
that
in
light
of
that--
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
thank
you.
i'd
like
to
point
out
for
the
court
what
the
criminal
provisions
involved
in
this
case
do
and
do
not
do.
it
is
not
a
crime
for
a
party
central
committee
to
make
an
endorsement.
it
is
a
crime
for
somebody
to
claim
that
a
candidate
for
the
party's
nomination
in
a
primary
election
is
endorsed
by
the
party,
and
so
it
doesn't
follow...
and
not
even
the
plaintiffs
contend
that
section
29102
is
applicable
to
the
endorsement
statute
for
the
reasons
stated
in
our
brief.
it
is
not,
or
to
any
of
the
other
statutes.
those
apply
to
election
officials
only.
that
is
referred
to
in
people
v.
crutcher,
and
it
is
also
reflected
in
section
15
of
the
elections
code
which
tracks
the
language
in
29102.
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
being
hit
with
a,
a
petition
for
an
injunction
in
state
court,
justice
scalia.
this...
these
statutes
are
designed
to
protect
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
members
of
the
political
parties.
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
that's
correct.
the...
another
point
that
we'd
like
to
make
is
that
although
the
provision
for
the
bar
on
endorsements
did
not
show
up
in
statute
until
1963,
it
is
well
documented
and
undisputed
that
this
has
been
the
longstanding
policy
of
the
major
parties
in
california
all
the
way
through
to
the
present
time,
and
there
is
really
nothing
substantial
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
that
is
not
the
case
to
this
day.
the
state
does
have
an
overriding
compelling
interest,
i
believe,
if
justice
white
was
referring
to
the
storer
case.
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
it
was
a
compelling
interest
standard,
and
california
was
found
to
have
met
that
standard
in
storer,
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
parties
in
the
primary
system
and
in
the
general
election
system.
mr.
geoffrey
lloyd
graybill
thank
you,
justice
brennan.
