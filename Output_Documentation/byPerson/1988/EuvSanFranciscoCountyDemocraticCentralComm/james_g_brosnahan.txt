mr.
james
g.
brosnahan
if
it
please
the
court:
the
state
of
california,
as
has
been
shown
in
the
record
before
your
honors,
dictates
what
political
parties
can
say,
and
indeed,
who
it
is,
at
least
by
office,
that
will
say
it.
and
in
doing
such,
the
state
aggrieves
the
first
amendment
in
some
very
serious
respects.
first
of
all,
this
is
a
prior
restraint
by
the
state.
secondly,
it
goes
to
the
subject
matter.
it
is
not
content-neutral.
it
bans
all
political
endorsements
by
all
parties.
third,
it
applies
not
only
to
mature
parties
such
as
the
democratic
party
or
the
republican
party,
but
also
one
of
my
clients
here,
the
state
libertarian
party,
who
is
forbidden
from
endorsing
candidates
by
one
of
the
sections
which
is
before
your
honors.
only
california
and
new
jersey
have
such
a
provision.
the
other
48
states
do
not
have
the
difficulties
such
that
the
state
counsel
was
seeking
to
elucidate
here
a
moment
ago.
mr.
james
g.
brosnahan
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry
to
bring
that
news.
[laughter]
also,
it
is
striking
that
the
prohibition
in
the
state
of
california
is
a
flat
prohibition.
it
does
not
present
the
kind
of
problem
as
in
buckley
v.
valeo,
where
you
could
say,
well,
it's
a
limitation
or
a
certain
amount
of
money
and
the
rest
can
at
least
be
used
for
expression.
no.
it
is
a
crime
in
california,
has
been
a
crime
since
1963,
for
a
political
party
to
state
its
endorsement
as
to
a
particular
candidate.
mr.
james
g.
brosnahan
that's
right,
your
honor,
unless
you
go
to
the
legislature
and
try
to
get
that
changed
up
there.
mr.
james
g.
brosnahan
you
have
to
have
a...
there
really
is
no
choice.
you
have
to
have
a
primary.
the
democratic
party
and
the
republican
party,
indeed,
any
party
would
have
to
bring
their
membership
down
below
1
percent
in
california
to
get
off
the
ballot,
if
they
chose
that
way
to
do
it.
we
submit
no
party
is
going
to
do
that.
so
really,
there's
no
choice.
mr.
james
g.
brosnahan
that's
true,
justice
white,
as
individuals,
but
not...
they
cannot--
mr.
james
g.
brosnahan
--no,
i
don't
think
they
could
do
that,
justice
white,
because
they
could
not
represent
in
any
way
directly--
mr.
james
g.
brosnahan
--if
they,
if
they
are
doing
something
that
purports
to
be
an
endorsement
by
the
committee,
and
there
would
have
to
be
lines
drawn,
then
it
would
be
criminal,
and--
mr.
james
g.
brosnahan
--not
yet,
but
there
is
one
california
case
that
does
refer
to
it
as
criminal,
and
indeed,
when
counsel
for
the
state
says
that
they
are
attempting
to
avoid
confusion,
in
fact,
in
the
state
of
california
there
are
slate
mailers...
and
these
are
in
the
record
described,
that
come
and
they
use
the
word
"democratic",
they
use
the
word
"republican",
and
they
list
who
should
be
there.
there's
tremendous
confusion,
tremendous
animosity
and
difficulties,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
not
only
is
the
party,
say,
the
republican
party,
not
free
to
endorse
a
candidate,
but
as
happened
to
the
democratic
party,
a
member,
a
grand
dragon
of
the
ku
klux
klan
was
nominated
in
san
diego
to
be
the
democratic
candidate
for
congress,
as
the
record
shows,
and
the
democratic
party
was
not
only
forced
by
the
law
of
california
to
be
silent,
it
could
say
nothing,
but
he
automatically
qualified
to
become
a
member
of
the
state
committee.
now,
they
did
in
that
case,
the
just
refused
to
seat
him,
they
just
wouldn't
seat
him,
but
the
law
was
that
he
became
a
member
of
the
democratic
party,
and
there
wasn't
anything
that
could
be
done
about
it.
the
history
of
these
provisions,
i'd
like
to
say
a
word
about
it
because
this
is
not
70
years
of
tradition.
as
with
regard
to
the
endorsement,
as
i
said,
that's
1963,
so
that's
a
relatively
new
provision.
as
to
the
provisions
with
regard
to
the
state
telling
the
parties
who
will
be
their
leaders,
that
does
go
back
further,
but
the
most
detailed
articulation
was
1977,
but
you
can
trace
it
all
the
way
back
in
some
form
or
another
to
1929.
so
it
has
been
a
gradual
accretion
of
power
by
the
legislature
in
california,
and
i
submit
that
the
court
is
not
looking
at
the
ghost
of
hiram
johnson
today
in
these
specific
provisions,
nor
is
the
basic--
mr.
james
g.
brosnahan
--in
this
case?
mr.
james
g.
brosnahan
no,
no,
your
honor.
those
are
elected,
i
would
say,
democratically.
mr.
james
g.
brosnahan
that's
true,
justice
o'connor,
and
the
main
ones
are,
specifically,
the
state
dictates
who
will
be
on
the
state
central
committees.
mr.
james
g.
brosnahan
it
is
not,
justice
o'connor.
that's
only...
we
have
found
only
one
state
where
it
is
like
california.
that's
kansas.
there
are
then
nine
states,
and
arizona
is
one
of
them,
and
michigan
is
one
of
them...
the
rest
are
mostly
western
states...
that
have
what
i
would
call
fairly
described
to
you
as
a
mix,
that
is
to
say,
people
can
be
elected
but
also
certain
officers
are
dictated
by
the
state
as
being
on
the
committee.
mr.
james
g.
brosnahan
the
rest
of
the
states,
that
is
to
say,
approximately
40
states,
do
not
purport
to
tell
political
parties
who
will
be
their
leadership.
mr.
james
g.
brosnahan
i
don't
think
so,
if
the
court
pleases.
i
read
that
decision.
and
reading
it
and
writing
it
are
two
different
things,
but
as
i
read
it,
in
the
state
of
washington
there
was
a
general
provision,
very
general,
very
broad,
about
political
parties,
and
the
only
dictation
was
there
should
be
a
balance
between
men
and
women.
the
rest
of
the
rights
that
were
involved
in
that
case...
and
this
was
the
reason
for
its
reversal...
was
that
all
of
the
other
provisions
came
from
the
democratic
party,
i
think
it
was
the
democratic
party
itself.
mr.
james
g.
brosnahan
that
is,
that
is
correct,
and
also,
i
believe--
mr.
james
g.
brosnahan
--up
to
that
point.
mr.
james
g.
brosnahan
there
is
that
language
in
the
case,
but
the
holding,
and
the
reason
i
think
it
was
sent
back,
and
the
reason
i
think
it
commended
itself
to
so
many
of
the
justices
here,
just
from
reading
it
was
that
all
of
the
internal
workings
which
were
being
challenged
in
fact
came
from
the
party
itself,
which
is
at
the
heart
of
the
right
of
association.
if
i
may
say
so,
the
burden
on
a
party
is
evident,
and
i
wish
to
stress
it.
when
the
state
dictates
to
a
political
party
who
their
leaders
shall
be
really
challenges
the
very
essence
of
an
association.
and
we
know
from
common
understanding,
just
watching
the
interest
people
have
in
who
the
leaders
will
be
of
a
political
party,
whether
it
be
in
the--
mr.
james
g.
brosnahan
--it
does.
mr.
james
g.
brosnahan
not
completely
resolved
by
that
provision
because
if
i'm
right,
and
i
think
i
am,
the
south
gets
to
be
the
chair
during
all
the
presidential
elections.
but
a
minor
point,
given
the
weighty
things
here.
but
there's
no
other
state,
there
is
no
other
state
that
we
can
find
that
has
any
such
limitation,
and
if...
say
the
libertarian
party,
for
example,
comes
up,
as
indeed
they
may,
with
a
vigorous,
vigorous,
vibrant
leader
who
is
able
to
increase
their
votes
from
2
percent
to
4
percent
to
6
percent.
the
state
of
california,
the
legislature
dictates
to
them
that
that
person
must
be
removed,
and
the
legislature
has
not
a
single
member
of
the
libertarian
party
there
to
even
entertain
a
bill,
much
less
to
muster
it.
mr.
james
g.
brosnahan
may
i
address
that--
mr.
james
g.
brosnahan
--not
so
much
in
chaney,
because
at
that
level
of
detail
in
chaney,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
would
be
accurate,
but
on
the
level
of
what
is
appropriate,
the
state
does
finance,
in
49
states
the
state
does
finance.
in
south
carolina
they
do
not.
but
they
certainly
have,
and
this
court
has
held,
certain
rights
with
regard
to
elections,
particularly
the
general
election
in
the
fall.
that
has
to
do
with
external
workings.
they
have
a
right,
as
has
been
said
in
this
case,
to
orderly
elections
and
to
statutes
reasonable
on
their
face
that
require
orderly
elections.
they
do
not
have
a
right,
and
this
is
the
profound
essence
of
this
case
as
far
as
at
least
my
clients
see
it,
they
do
not
have
a
right
to
orderly
parties.
that
is
a
completely
different
thing.
and
the
spectrum
along
which
we
move
with
this
case
is
far
removed
from
the
essence
of
a
state
saying,
for
example,
well,
you
must
be
in
a
party
a
certain
period
of
time
before
you
run
for
election,
as
has
been
brought
up
several
times
in
anderson
and
other
cases.
this
case
is
more
like
wigoda
v.
cousins
and
the
cases
where
this
court
held
that
the
state
may
not
say
who
will
be
a
delegate.
the
state
should
not
say
who
should
lead
parties,
and
i
am
prepared
at
least
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
this
is
a
very
dangerous
idea.
it
is
an
extremely
dangerous
idea,
and
one
that
does
not
commend
itself,
no
matter
what
one's
party,
to
a
comfortable
feeling
about
how
democracy
would
work
where
legislatures
would
dictate
who
would
lead
particular
parties.
justice
harlan
said
in
naacp
v.
alabama,
he
observed
a
nexus,
a
close
nexus
between
the
right
of
association
and
the
right
of
speech,
and
we
argue
that
today.
we
say
that
speech
is
affected
by
who
is
the
speaker;
who
it
is
that
will
lead
the
party
is
affected.
for
example,
the
irony
is,
going
back
to
the
days
of
populism
in
california
where
the
legislature,
as
has
been
historically
written
about,
was
in
some
ways
corrupt,
which
party
would
attack
that
problem
were
they
to
be
dictated
to
by
the
legislature
itself?
we
are
not
confronted
today
as
far
as
argument
is
concerned,
and
i
don't
think
this
court
is
confronted
with
an
abstract
question
about
whether
it
would
be
all
right
to
allow
a
legislature
to
decide
something,
and
that
is
because
each
legislator
would
have
interparty
and
intraparty
conflicts,
conflicts
as
to
whether
they
will
be
running
the
party
versus
someone
else,
and
conflicts
as
to
whether
the
libertarian
party,
of
which
they
will
not
be
a
member,
by
the
majority
in
the
california
legislature
at
least,
will
be
a
strong,
vibrant
party.
the
libertarian
party
in
this
case
was
required
to
adopt
the
rules
of
the
peace
and
freedom
party.
they
had
to
take
those
rules.
that's
all
that,
that's
all
that
they
could
get
up
to
this
point.
mr.
james
g.
brosnahan
nothing
justice
scalia,
in
this
case,
as
we
argue
to
your
honor,
nothing
in
this
case
implicates
or
attacks
the
primary
system.
mr.
james
g.
brosnahan
i
think
the
state--
mr.
james
g.
brosnahan
--i
think
the
line
is
right
around
the
poll
which
has
to
do
with
the
state's
right
to
see
that
in
an
earlier
election
party
disputes
are
resolved.
and
this
court
had
spoken
to
that
issue.
there
is,
there
is
a
right
that
the
state
has
to
see
to
it
that
in
the
general
election,
party
disputes
will
have
been
resolved.
we
don't
quarrel
with
that
because
it
doesn't
relate
to
the
two
major
clusters
of
issues,
endorsement
and
leadership
in
the
party.
it
doesn't
relate
to
that
at
all.
and
so
we
do
not
question
the
right
of
the
state
to
say
if
you
are
a
republican,
for
example,
and
you
have
a
party
dispute,
you
should
run
in
the
primary
election,
and
it
will
all
be
resolved,
or
some
states
have
variations
with
conventions
and
alternatives
and
things
like
that.
mr.
james
g.
brosnahan
that's
correct.
mr.
james
g.
brosnahan
that's
correct.
mr.
james
g.
brosnahan
and
also
wisconsin
v.
lafollette,
and
the
times
have
really
changed
in
terms
of
the
old
populist
notions
which,
as
i
say,
are
not
implicated
by
these
specific
statutes.
nowhere
today
does
one
see
the
kinds
of
bosses
that
were
here
60,
70
years
ago.
james
michael
curley,
mayor
haig,
boss
tweed,
these
people
are
gone.
there
are,
there
are
powerful
legislators,
and
that
is,
that
is
at
least
a
footnote
to
this
story
in
the
sense
that
we
believe
this
case
presents
this
court
with
an
opportunity
to
write
an
opinion
which
will
allow
political
parties
in
this
country
of
whatever
name,
if
they
choose...
and
that's
a
major
point
that's
been
made...
if
they
choose,
to
be
open
and
to
bring
in
in
the
neighborhoods
of
this
country
people
to
participate
in
parties.
all
of
my
clients,
and
there
are
many...
i
represent
on
the
democratic
side
the
county
committees...
justice
white
asked
about
this...
the
county
committees
that
represent,
in
registered
voters,
over
half
of
the
registered
democrats
in
the
state
of
california...
to
open
up
this
process,
as
it
is
true
in
other
states,
so
that
citizens
without
a
lot
of
power
can
be
part
of
this
process.
the
people
in
california,
i
think,
fairly
stated,
would
enjoy
as
any
citizen
would
enjoy
what
is
done
in
other
states.
i
think
of
minnesota,
it's
in
the
record,
i
think
of
massachusetts.
there
are
declarations
by
james
mcgregor
burns
and
by
the
mayor
of
minneapolis,
and
they
give
figures
to
this
court
as
to
what
happens
when
parties
are
free
to
structure
themselves
the
way
they
want.
the
state
of
massachusetts,
sometimes,
there
are
over
hundreds
of
thousands
of
citizens
who
participate
in
the
party.
it
is
not
dictated
from
a
capital.
it
is
not,
it
is
not
the
question
of
dominance.
the
standard
is
compelling
interest.
the
state
has
great
trouble
in
articulating
that,
that
standard,
or
to
give
this
court
a
basis
on
which
to
treat,
as
you
are
required
to
do
in
many
other
cases,
the
serious
concerns
articulated,
and
there's
been
five
years
of
litigation.
mr.
james
g.
brosnahan
i
think
it
is
probably
unconstitutional.
two
years
certainly
is
very
short
and
cuts
right
into
the
accumulated
experience
and
leadership
qualities
that
one
might
possess.
in
fact,
one
of
these
parties
changed
its
term,
and
i
don't
know
about
ten
years.
you
could
come
to
a
point,
i
suppose,
where
the
state
would
make
a
greater
interest.
but
i
have
not,
i
have
not
heard,
nor
have
i
read
a
strong
compelling
interest
based
on
general
elections,
based
on
that
justification,
for
the
limitation
of
the
term.
why
does
the
state
need
to
tell
the
libertarian
party
you
will
have
a
leader
for
two
years,
and
at
the
end
of
that
two
years,
no
matter
what
you
have
accomplished,
no
matter
what
you
have
done,
you
will
be
out.
surely
i
think
i
sense
that
we
are
at
the
very
heart
of
the
first
amendment.
one
reads
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
the
scholarly
musings
of
professor
emerson
or
meiklejohn
