mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
turn
in
this
case
from
hard
rock
music
to
hard
rock
metals.
at
issue
is
the
validity
of
an
arizona
statute
which
provides
that
minerals
in
federally
granted
lands
shall
be
leased
upon
payable...
upon
payment
of
a
royalty
of
5
percent
on
the
net
value
of
the
minerals
actually
extracted.
the
court
below
held
that
that
statute
was
invalid
because
it
failed
to
provide
for
prior
appraisal
of
the
properties
and
leasing
at
appraised
value,
which
procedures
the
court
below
held
were
required
by
the
enabling
act
of
1910
pursuant
to
which
arizona
was
admitted
to
the
union.
the
issue
is
not,
i
hasten
to
say,
whether
arizona
shall
be
permitted
to
give
away
its
minerals
or
to
lease
them
on
fire
sale
basis
such
as
is
alleged
in
some
of
the
briefs,
nor
is
it
a
matter
of
invoking
basic
trust
principles
in
support
of
the
decision
below.
that
decision,
which
was
made
on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment,
contain
no
finding
that
arizona
had
been
profligate
or
wasteful
in
its
handling
of
its
minerals.
there
could
have
been
no
finding
because
there
was
no
evidence.
the
court
found
purely
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
that
the
enabling
act
of
1910
required
that
mineral
leasing
be
done
on
the
basis
of
prior
appraisal
and
leasing
at
appraised
value.
the
issue
arises
in
these
circumstances.
in
1910,
congress
granted
to
arizona
substantial
acreage
of
federal
land
when
it
entered
the
union.
it
provided
in
that
grant
that
arizona
and
new
mexico,
who
was
party
to
the
same
act,
could
not
dispose
of
the
federally
granted
lands
except
after
advertising,
auction
and
appraisement.
that
grant
in
1910
excluded
mineral
lands,
which
was
the
custom
of
all
of
the
federal
grants
with
one
exception
at
that
time.
no
mineral
lands
were
granted.
they
were
reserved
and
administered
under
the
federal
leasing
program.
some
17
years
later,
congress
provided
in
the
jones
act
that
not
only
arizona,
but
the
other
11
western
states
should
now
receive
the
numbered
mineral
sections
that
had
been
withheld
from
them
in
the
original
1910
act.
the
jones
act
said
nothing
about
dispositional
restrictions.
it
did
provide
that
the
minerals
could
not
be
sold,
but
they
could
be
leased
as
the
state
legislature
would
direct.
in
1936,
congress
amended
the
enabling
act
of
1910
to
provide
that
arizona
could
lease
the
minerals,
the
so-called
hidden
minerals,
in
lands
which
were
not
known
to
be
mineral
at
the
time
of
the
grant.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
minerals.
lease
the
mineral
land,
yes,
your
honor,
for...
for
the
use
the
minerals.
and
the
1936
act,
as
i
say,
provided
that
arizona
could
lease
the
mineral
lands
which
were
given
to
it
somewhat
inadvertently
by
the
1910
act.
these
were
lands
which
were
not
known
to
be
mineral
at
the
time
and,
therefore,
were
not
excluded,
but
which
this
court
in
a
series
of
decisions
in
the
1920s
said
had
passed
to
arizona
and
new
mexico,
nonetheless.
now,
arizona
and
new
mexico
both
had
adopted
basically
the
federal
leasing
procedures
for
the
hidden
minerals
and
had
not
provided
for
appraisement,
advertising
and
auction.
in
1941,
pursuant
to
the
authorizations
that
had
been
given
it
by
these
two
earlier
federal
acts,
arizona
enacted
the
statute
that
is
attacked
here
which
provides
for
a
flat
5
percent
royalty
on
extracted
minerals
and
does
not
provide
for
auction,
advertising
and
appraisal.
this
action...
i
might
say
at
this
point
that
that
statute
passed
in
1941
has
ever
been
attacked
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
who
has
the
duty
under
the
act
to
enforce
it
and
has
what
this
court
has
referred
to
as
an
ongoing
oversight
responsibility.
this
action
was
brought
by
three
taxpayers
in
arizona
and
by
the
arizona
teachers
association
which
consists
of...
whose
members
are
20,000
public
school
teachers
in
arizona.
the
claim
is
that
the
dispositional
restrictions,
at
least
the
appraisal
restriction,
in
the
1910
act
limit
arizona's
authority
to
lease
minerals
since
the
statute
does
not
provide
it
is
invalid.
it...
they
further
allege
in
the
complaint
that
had
arizona
provided
for
appraisal
and
appraising
at
the...
leasing
at
the
appraised
value,
more
revenues
would
have
come
in
from
the
mineral
lands...
from
the
leasing
of
the
mineral
lands,
and
that
those
revenues
would
have
either
or
both
reduced
the
taxes
that
the
taxpayers
were
paying
for
the
support
of
the
schools,
or
improve
the
quality
of
education
by
infusing
more
money
into
the
public
school
system.
i
shall
first
address
two
contentions
the
solicitor
general
has
made
as
to
why
the
court
should
let
the
decision
below
stand
and
not
review
it.
the
first
suggestion
is
that
the
respondents,
on
whose
side
the
solicitor
general
appears,
lack
standing
in
an
article
iii
sense.
so
far
as
the
teachers
are
concerned,
there
does
not
seem
to
be
any
real
question
that
these
teachers
have
a
particularized
interest
in
the
public
school
system
of
which
they
are
such
an
integral
part,
and
that
if
they
are
right
in
their
complaint,
they
have
been
injured
by
an
improper
failure
of
the
state
to
put
more
money
into
the
schools.
the
claim,
as
far
as
the
teachers
are
concerned,
seems
to
be
that
they
are
unable
to
claim
with
the
requisite
certainty
that
the
redress
they
ask...
that
is,
invalidation
of
the
statute...
will
give
them
the
relief
that
would
take
care
of
the
quality
of
education.
in
this
respect,
we
believe
that
the
solicitor
general
misconceives
the
basic
principle
which,
as
was
recently
stated
in
bryant
v
yellen,
is
not
that
someone
who
has
been
injured
need
to
established
with
certainty
that
the
relief
he
seeks
is
going
to
give
him
what
he
wants,
but
that
there
must
merely
be
a
reasonable
expectation
of
that
relief.
and
we
would
submit
that
from
the
teachers'
point
of
view,
there
is
that
reasonable
expectation
that
if
they're
right
and
if
more
money
comes
in,
the
quality
of
education
is
going
to
be
improved
in
the
state
of
arizona.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
no.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
there
is
a
general
tax
fund
of
substantial
proportions
which
is
spent.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
your
honor,
i
don't--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
--let
me
say
i
don't
believe
there
has
to
be
a
necessary
connection.
i
think
there
was
a--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
--reasonable
expectation
that
if
more
money
comes
in
from
the
lands,
it
is
either
going
to
be
used
for
education
or
it's
going
to
be
used
to
reduce
taxes,
or
being
a
political
problem--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
--it
doesn't
help
the
teachers.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
think
that
the
education
gets
more
from
general
revenues
than--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
--from
the
school
lands.
but
everything
that
comes
from
the
school
lands
has
to
go
to
support
education.
and
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
reasonable
expectation
that...
that
if
they
can
increase
by
$5
million,
for
example,
the
amount
coming
from
school
lands,
that's
going
to
go
to
education.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
think
on
the
books
for
certain
it
would
better
able
the
teachers
to
carry
out
their
professional
duties,
give
them
greater
satisfaction
and
give
them
a
greater
ability
to
help
the
students,
which
is
what
they're
trying
to
do
anyway.
i
would
say
that
that
kind
of
a
benefit
is...
or
an
injury
that
they're
getting
now
is
certainly
comparable
to
the
students
around
washington
in
the
scrap
case
who
were
deprived
of
the
pleasures
of
walking
in
the
parks
here
by
too
much
recyclable
material
being
present.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
it's
still,
as
i
understand,
good
law,
your
honor.
but
i
do
think
the
teachers
have
a
keen
professional
interest
here,
just
as
citizens
in
the
gladstone,
realtors
case
had
an
interest
in
living
in
a
segregated
area.
it
may
not
be
strictly
a
financial
interest.
it's
a
professional,
a
social,
and
a
cultural
interest.
on...
on
the
taxpayers,
it
is
true
that
many
taxpayers
have
been
held
to
lack
to
standing
under
section
3,
but
i
submit
it
is
where
they
have
brought
what
might
be
called
good
government
or
generalized
grievances
or
have
attempted
to...
to
validate
certain
interests
that
they
might
have.
this
i
think
is
the
pocketbook
case,
the
dollars
and
cents
case,
that
was
referred
to
in
doremus.
there
is
even
a
separate
tax
involved
here
in
these
royalties
where
these
taxpayers
can
legitimately
claim
that
they
are
paying
too
much
because
the
state
is
getting
too
little.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
your
honor,
i
didn't
think
it
went
quite
that
far.
in
addition
to
flast,
there
was
the
grand
rapids
v.
ball
recently
which...
which
did
give
standing
in...
in
flast.
but
i
would
think--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
--yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
but
these
taxpayers
are
claiming
that
the
state
has
violated
the
specific
strictures
in
the
solemn
compact
between
the
united
states
and
the
federal
government.
and
i
would
think
that
those
strictures
would
be
the
substantial
equivalent
to
the
constitutional
prohibitions
that
gave
standing
in
flast
and
in
grand...
grand
rapids.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
either
one
or
the
other.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
finally,
or
the
question
of
standing,
we
would
submit
that
in
the
event
the
court
feels
there
is
no
standing
which,
of
course,
we
think
there
is,
the
proper
course
of
action,
as
it
has
done
in
the
case
where
there
is
intervening
mootness,
would
be
to...
to
remand
with
directions
to
vacate
so
that
these
respondents,
who
are
the
ones
lacking
the
standing
who
have
the
defect,
would
not
get
the
benefit
of
what
will
be
a
final
judgment
on
a
very
important
question
of
federal
law.
this
is
more
than
just
an
advisory
opinion,
an
opinion
of
the
justices
or
the
attorney
general.
this
opinion
is
binding
on
the
state
legislature.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
in
doremus
it
was
this...
the...
the
holding
was
against
the
people
who
lacked
standing.
it
was
not
in
their
favor.
we
have
found
no
case,
despite
the
suggestions
in
doremus...
and
none
has
been
cited
to
us...
where
respondents
who
lack
standing
were
able
to
retain
a
decision
below.
what
you
have
suggested
in
doremus
might
make
that
possible,
but
it
would
seem
here
where
we're
not
going
to
get
the
second
chance
to
contest
this,
which
was
one
of
the
things
that
led
you
where
you
were
in
doremus
that
it
would
not
be
too
much--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
--oh,
i
don't--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
--i
don't
see
any
real
difference
between
that
and
the
situation
where
mootness
has
intervened
between
the
decision
below
and
what
you
are
doing
now.
you
no
longer...
you
don't
have
any
jurisdiction,
but
nonetheless
you
will
vacate.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
not...
not
from
a
state
court.
i
think
you're
right.
but
i
would
suggest
that
what
we're
suggesting
to
you
here,
while
there
may
not
be
precedent
for
it,
is
really
a
very,
very
minimum...
has
a
minimum
potential
for
invasion
of
the
state
authority.
this
doesn't
happen
and
isn't
going
to
happen
very
often
where
respondents
who
are
lacking,
as
is
alleged
here,
are
going
to
prevail
below
in
a
definitive
way
which
is
going
to
prevent
the
petitioners,
who
have
lost
below,
from
ever
getting
a
ruling
by
this
court
on
an
important
federal
question.
but
i...
i
go
back
to
the
standing
question.
we
do
think
that
there
is
standing
for
both
of
these
people
and,
as
justice
white
has
said,
only
one
of
them
needs
to
have
the
standing
in
order
to
be
properly
in
this
court.
the
second
suggestion
of
the
solicitor
general
is
that
the
decision
of
the
state
court
lacks
finality
to
permit
this
court
to
review.
in
that...
as
to
that,
we
believe
that
that
represents
a
misconception
as
to
what
was
decided
below
and
what
remains
to
be
decided
now.
the
solicitor
general
says
there
remains
to
be
cited
the...
whether
the
leases
that
petitioners
have
are
void.
now,
that
was
not
an
issue
that
was
presented
to
the
court
below.
respondents,
in
bringing
their
suit,
never
asked
for
any
kind
of
a
determination
as
to
the
voidability
of
these
leases.
it
is
not
a
decision...
it
is
not
an
issue
that
should
come
up
before
the
court
below
on
remand.
when
the...
when
the
arizona
supreme
court
held
in
respondents'
favor,
it
gave
them
everything
they
asked
for,
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
royalty
provision
was
invalid,
and
said
they
could
have
an
injunction
against
further
leases.
now,
on
remand,
the
superior
court
has
entered
the
injunction
holding
that
the
leasing
statute...
the
royalty
provision
is
bad.
it
has
not
gone
further
and
enjoined
further
leases
presumably
because
the
state
has
said
they
are
not
going
to
issue
and
they
have
not
issued
any
new
leases.
and
the
state...
and
the
court
has
held
up
action
pending
a...
an
attempt
by
all
the
parties
to
work
out
legislation
which
would
take
care
of
what
the
arizona
court
has
done.
and
the
holders
of
the...
of
the
present
leases
are
continuing
to
operate
the
mines.
they
are
continuing
to
pay
money,
to
pay
the
royalties
of
the
5
percent.
and
there
is
an
agreement
with
the
state
that
if
and
when
the
legislature
acts
pursuant
to
this
arizona
statute,
any
new
financial
arrangements
will
be
made
retroactive
to
january
1,
1988,
which
is
essentially
the
date
of
the
decision
below.
but
no
proposal
was
made
to
the
lower
court
on
remand
that
the
leases
be
voided.
we,
therefore,
think
that
this
is
within
the
exceptions
spelled
out
in
cox
broadcasting
where
the
court
will
hear...
review
state
court
judgments
even
though
some
ministerial
or
pre-ordained
things
need
to
be...
happen
such
as
you
decided
in
the
duquesne
light
case
here
a
couple
of
weeks
ago.
i
turn
now
to
the
substantive
issues.
the
validity
of
this
statute
depends
upon
a
proper
interpretation
of
four
federal
statutes
which
were
passed
between
1910
and
1951.
the
first
of
these
is
the
enabling
act
to
which
i
have
referred.
it
does
not
include
a
grant
of
minerals.
we
believe
that
there
was
no
occasion
for
congress
to
consider
whether
the
dispositional
restrictions
that
it
imposed
in
1910
were
appropriate
and
should
be
applied
to
minerals
simply
because
congress,
in
accordance
with
its
practice
since
1985,
had
not
granted
any
minerals
and
did
not
have
any
occasion
to
consider
what,
if
any,
kind
of
procedures
should
follow
the
leasing
of
minerals.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
reserved
the
mineral
rights,
as
did
practically
all
of
the
enabling
acts
of
the
other
states
in
the
previous
five
or
six
decades.
so,
we
believe
that
we
have
to
look
elsewhere
to
the
three
other
acts,
or
principally
to
the
jones
act,
to
determine
whether
these
restrictions...
and
i
might
note
that
these
restrictions
were...
were
more
rigorous
than
those
imposed
on
any
of
the
other
states
because
prior
to
1910,
some
of
the
states,
and
new
mexico
when
it
was
a
territory,
had
behaved
in
a
way
that
the
congress
thought
was
irresponsible,
either
negligent
or
possibly
fraudulent
in
disposing
of
resources.
so,
they
took
it
out
on
new
mexico
and
arizona
and
imposed
these
three
dispositional
restrictions
on
them
in
1910.
we
come
to
1927,
the
jones
act,
which
was
a
landmark
change
on
the
part
of
federal
policy.
for
the
first
time,
the
federal
government
gave
up
the
mineral
wealth
in
12
western
states
and
gave
it
to
each
state.
and
it
provided
at
that
time
that,
first,
the
states
could
not
sell
the
mineral
wealth,
but
they
could
lease
them
as
the
individual
state
legislatures
would
provide.
now,
there
was
in
1927,
unlike
1910,
no
concern
about
states'
responsibility.
the
western
states
had
grown
up.
they
had
achieved
maturity.
they
had
political
muscle.
it
was
all
a
question
of
how
right
it
was
to
transfer
this
mineral
wealth
to
the
western
states
because
the
eastern
states
already
had
it
right
from
the
beginning.
our
opponents
take...
take
the
position
that
four
or
five
words
in
the
granting
clause
of
the
jones
act,
these
words
being
these
grants
"shall
be
of
the
same
effect.
"
as
the
1910
act...
that
those
words
incorporate
by
reference
all
of
the
dispositional
restrictions
in
the
1910
act.
we
believe
that
that
puts
much
too
great
a
load
on
those
four
or
five
words.
in
the
first
place,
this
paragraph,
section
a
in
which
these
words
appear,
was
not
even
in
the
bill
until
after
both
houses
of
congress
had
agreed
on
the
substance
of
the
legislation.
it
was
put
in
at
the
suggestion
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
who
was
concerned
that
there
might
be
a
necessity
for
patents
or
some
other
procedures,
and
wanted
to
have
it
made
clear
that
the
title
would
pass
ipso
facto,
so
to
speak,
when
the
legislation
was
passed.
furthermore,
this
is
a
granting
section.
it
isn't
a
restriction
section.
the
restrictions
are
in
the
next
section.
and
if
these
words
mean
what
the
court
below
and
respondents
say
they
mean,
there
will
be
a...
a
real
conflict
with
the
following
section
which
does
contain
restrictions.
those
restrictions
are
that
all
of
the
money
that
is
obtained
be
used
for
the
support
of
the
public
schools.
if
means
what
the
respondents
say
it
does,
that
was
already
taken
care
of
because
that
was
provided
in
the
1910
act.
there
was
no
need
to
put
it
in
again.
secondly,
subsection
a
contains
a
very
important
restriction...
restriction
that
the
minerals
may
not
be
sold
by
the
state.
now,
that
isn't
to
the
same
effect
of
the
1910
act
because
the
1910
act
and
all
of
the
enabling
acts
permitted
sales
under
various
conditions.
so,
this
is
in
direct
contrast
to
the
same
effect
meaning
that
the
respondents
and
the
court
below
would
ask
for.
now,
in
addition,
we--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
--subsection
a
has
the
"shall
have
the
effect".
it
is
subsection
b--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
--which
has
the
restrictions.
a
being
the
granting
provision,
and
b
being
the
provision
of
restrictions.
secondly--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
--i
think
it
is
confined
entirely
to
the
passage
of
title,
that
the
title
to
these
lands,
unlike
the
title
to
some
other
lands,
mineral
lands,
for
example,
under
the
mineral
law
where
you
did
have
to
go
through
patents,
would
pass
automatically
just
as
the
1910
granted
lands
did
pass
automatically.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
now,
we
believe
that
the...
the
proponents
of
the
decision
below
also
err
in
giving--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
--it
may
be
a
redundancy.
the
secretary
of
interior
put
in
the
entire
section
a.
and
his
only
concern,
as
near
as
could
be
[inaudible],
had
to
do
with
the
passage
of
title.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
it's
entirely
possible
he
might
have
done
it
in
two
sentences
instead
of
one,
which
would
have
been
a
more
careful
way.
but
this
was
not
legislation.
this
was...
it...
it
was
his...
his
reasoning
as
to
why
this
ought
to
go
in.
but
there
was
no
suggestion
by
him
or
anybody
else
that
those
words
would
carry
with
it
an
incorporation
by
reference
not
only
of
the
restrictions
in
arizona-new
mexico,
but
all
other
12
states.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
the...
the
respondents
also
give
insufficient
meaning
to
this
specific
grant
to
the
states
to
lease
the
minerals.
they
say
that
all
that
it
means
is
that
the
states
will
establish
leasing
forms
and
procedures,
sort
of
a
ministerial
thing.
we
submit
that
that
was
unnecessary.
leases
were
provided
for
in
the
1910
act.
there
was
no
specific
reference
to
the
state
governing
leasing
forms
or
doing
anything.
so,
it
must
have
been
assumed,
quite
naturally,
that
the
legislature
would
have,
through
its
sovereign
powers,
the
inherent
power
to
take
care
of
these
minor
details
which,
the
respondents
say,
is
all
that
is
covered
by
the
specific
leasing
authority
granted
in
the
1927
act.
in
summary,
we
submit
that
it
is
the
jones
act
that
is
the
principal
act
that
should
be
looked
to.
and
that's
an
act
which
gets
very
little
attention
in
the
brief
of
respondents.
but
it
was
the
act
wherein
the
congress
finally
showed
confidence
in
the
states
and
a
willingness
to
give
them
very
substantial
authority
over
leasing
and
showed
no
disposition
to
limit
that
authority
by
reiterating
anything
about
the
dispositional
restrictions
that
had
been
imposed
many
years
later
under
quite
different
circumstances.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
they
removed
them
on...
on
grazing...
grazing
lands
and
on
mineral,
both
types
of
mineral
lands,
but
they
have
not
been
removed
on
the
others.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
well,
it
may
have
been
that
the
other
was
working
all
right.
the...
the
land
law
legislation,
as
you
can
see
here,
has
not
been
entirely
logical
on
a
year-to-year
basis.
it
goes
in
fits
and
starts.
and
all
of
these
acts
aren't
congruent.
it
just
may
be
that
nobody
from
arizona
or
any
other
state
ever
came
and
said
these
are
burdensome.
they
were
able
to
live
with
them.
they
didn't
need
to
do
that
on
the
minerals
because
congress
from
the
beginning
recognized,
largely
on
its
own
experience,
that
the
minerals
did
deserve
a
certain
kind
of
treatment,
a
different
kind
of
treatment.
the
next
act
that
one
would
look
to
is
the
1936
amendment
to
the
enabling
act.
the
jones
act
was
not
an
amendment
to
the
enabling
act.
it
was
a
freestanding
act.
in
1936
it
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
congress,
justice
white,
that
the
leasing
of
minerals,
so-called
hidden
minerals,
on
lands
which
were
not
known
to
be
mineral
at
the
time
of
the
grant,
but
were
later
discovered
in
minerals,
was
not
covered
by
any
kind
of
legislation.
the
jones
act
didn't
cover
them.
the
jones
act
was
limited
to
the
numbered
mineral
sections.
and
nothing
covered
the
states
of...
the...
arizona's
authority
to
lease
these
hidden
minerals.
now,
arizona
and
new
mexico
had,
ever
since
the
time
of
the
1910
act,
been
leasing
these
hidden
minerals,
and
they
had
been
doing
it
without
appraisal,
without
advertising,
without
auction,
basically
in
accordance
with
established
federal
procedures.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
yes.
these
were
not
covered
by
the
jones
act
and
were
held
by
decisions
of
this
court
to
have
passed
under
the
1910
act.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
your
honor,
i
don't
understand
that
either
the
solicitor
general
or
the
attorney
general
of
arizona,
who
has
come
in
as
amicus,
argues
that
there
is
an
existing,
independent
and
adequate
state
ground
to
support
this
decision.
what
they
suggest
rather
is
that
the
arizona
constitution
has
been
interpreted
in
a
subsequent
case
down
in
arizona,
deer
valley,
which
doesn't
involve
minerals
and
doesn't
involve
leasing,
as
going
further
than
the
enabling
acts.
now,
that
is
somewhat
contrary
to
the
perceived
learning
which
was
the
enabling
act
which
was...
which
required
the
constitution
provisions
meant
the
same
thing.
but
what
they're
saying
is
not
that
this
decision
has
an
adequate
state
ground,
but
maybe
sometime
in
the
future,
if
the
arizona
court
ever
gets
around
to
this,
they
might
apply
in
the
mineral
leasing
situation
the
kind
of
reasoning
they
did
in
deer
valley.
but
that
is
sheer
speculation
as
to
what
they
are
going
to
apply.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
no,
they
have
not,
and
i
don't
think...
i'm
sure
the
solicitor
general
even
does
not
assert
that
they
have
done
that.
and
the
reason
for
it
i
think
is
plain.
there
is
no
statement
in
here.
the
court...
the
arizona
court
reasoned
entirely
from
the
legislative
history
and
the
federal
legislation
as
to
what
the
meaning
of
both
the
enabling
acts
and
the
arizona
constitution
was.
i
mention
it
with
respect
to
the
1936
act.
new
mexico's
right
to
lease
minerals
in
such
manner
as
its
legislature
has
seen
fit
had
been
confirmed
by
the
congress
way
back
in
1928
at
about
the
time
congress
was
passing
the
jones
act.
a
case
had
been
decided
in...
in
the
new
mexico
supreme
court,
neel
v.
barker,
which
said
that
the
dispositional
restrictions
of
the
1910
act
did
not
affect
mineral
leasing
on
the
hidden
lands.
and
the
congress
of
1928
passed
a
resolution
saying,
yes,
that's
all
right.
we'll
send
it
back
and
let
new
mexico
decide
by
a
plebiscite
whether
it
wants
to
have
its
legislature
do
that.
so,
new
mexico
had
been
freed
since
1928
from
any
of
these
restrictions
in
the...
in
the
mineral
leasing
act...
in
so...
in
the
1910
act
insofar
as
mineral
leasing
was
concerned.
the
1936
act
was
directed
only
at
freeing
arizona
in
the
same
way...
not
in
the
same
way,
but
to
the
same
extent
that
arizona
had
already
been
freed.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
xxx.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
that
is
right,
your
honor.
now,
the
arizona
legislature
has
accommodated
those
two
rather
modest
differences
by
providing
in
its
statute
that...
that
all
federal
lands,
however
they
came
about,
shall
be
leased
in
a
way
that
would
take
care
of
the
requirements
of
the
jones
act
and
the
enabling
act.
they
cannot
be
sold,
and
the
leases
are
limited
to
20
years.
but
there
are
those
two
regimes.
i
will
mention
finally
the
1951
act
on
which
the
respondents
rely
importantly.
the
important
thing
about
that
act
is
that
it
did
not
impose
any
dispositional
restrictions
either
on
hard
rock
minerals,
which
are
what
we're
talking
about
here,
or
on
hydrocarbon
minerals
which,
for
the
first
time,
were
set
up
as
a
separate
regime.
and,
therefore,
it
is
improper
to
make
any
kind
of
an
inference
from
that
act
of
legislation.
