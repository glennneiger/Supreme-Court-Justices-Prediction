mr.
christopher
j.
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
our
view,
all
that
this
court
should
decide
is
that
it
lacks
jurisdiction
under
28
u.s.c.
1257
because
there
has
been
no
final
judgment
here.
the
arizona
supreme
court
remanded
this
case
to
the
superior
court
with
instructions,
which
are
reprinted
at
page
29
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
and
they
state:
"it
is
not
possible"
on
this
record...
"it
is
not
possible
to
tell
on
this
record
just
what
further
relief
is
appropriate.
"
"the
trial
court
is
instructed
to
hear
arguments
and,
if
appropriate,
take
evidence
on
that
question
and
to
grant
such
relief
as
may
be
appropriate
and
consistent
with
the
principles
announced
in
this
decision.
"
in
these
circumstances,
it
would
drain
section
1257's
finality
rule
of
all
meaning
to
hold
that
there
has
been
a
final
judgment.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
this...
this
court
has
held,
though,
that
it...
it
does
have
meaning,
that...
and
the
only
possible
exception
that
applies
here
is
that
the
proceedings
to
be
conducted
on
remand
are
merely
ministerial.
however,
it
is
not
the
case
that
they
are
merely
ministerial
here.
there
are
very
serious
questions
to
be
decided
on
remand.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
what
the
court
said
in
duquesne,
as
i
understood
it,
was
that...
that
proceedings
on
remand
were
simply
for
the
public
utility
commission
to
apply
a
mathematical
formula
and...
in
determining
what
relief
was
appropriate.
here
it's
very
different.
there
is
a
very
live
issue
as
to
whether
asarco
and
the
other
mining
companies'
leases
are
void.
and...
and
we
expect
that
there's
going
to
be
significant
litigation
on
remand
on
that
issue
which
is
an
issue
of
federal
law
because
the
enabling
act
says
in
section...
in
paragraph
10
of
section
28
that
leases
are
void
unless
there
has
been
substantial
conformity
with...
with
the
terms
of
this
act.
and...
and
that
is
what
is
to
be
decided
on
remand.
now,
asarco's
sole
argument
has
been
that
this
is
final
because
the
plaintiffs
haven't
sought
to
void
the
leases.
well,
that
is
wrong.
and
i'd
like
to
devote
a
couple
of
minutes
to
that
point.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
respondents
agree
that
the
mineral
leases
are
void,
and
they
will
seek
to
void
them.
respondents
are
a
little
bit
uncomfortable
with
this
argument
because
they
believe
it
is
so
clear
that
the
mining
companies'
leases
are
void
that
they...
that
they
don't
think
that
the
litigation
on
remand
will
be
as
substantial
as
we
think
it
may
be.
but...
but
they--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--yes,
that
is
correct
for
a
totally
different
reason
than
the
mining
companies
believe,
i
may
add.
they're
both
taking
extreme
positions:
one,
that
the
plaintiffs
haven't
asked
to
void
the
leases;
and
the
other,
that
the
leases
are
so
clearly
void
that
it
won't
take
much
on
remand
to
hold
that.
now,
obviously,
they
can't--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--excuse
me?
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
intend
to
get
to
the
merits,
justice
blackmun.
but
i
do
want
to
state
very
quickly
that
in
the
notice
to
the
defendant
class,
point
a
under
the
possible
consequences
of
a
judgment
in
favor
of
the
plaintiffs
is
current
state
mineral
leases
might
be
invalidated.
and
i
would
also
like
to
note
that
in
asarco's
motion
to
intervene,
they
said
that
plaintiffs
seek
to
have
the
arizona
mining
statute
declared
unconstitutional,
thereby
invalidating
all
existing
mineral
lease
agreements.
so,
it
has
long
been
understood
that
the
plaintiffs
seek
to
have
these...
these
leases
declared
void.
and
there...
there
can
really
be
no
argument
on
that
point.
and,
as
i've
said,
as
long
as
there
is
a
dispute
on
this
point,
we
don't
think
it
can
be
said,
as
in
duquesne,
that
the
proceedings
to
be
conducted
on
remand
are
merely
ministerial.
turning
then
to
the
merits,
i
think
it
would
be
useful
to
look
at
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
something
that
hasn't
been
done
yet.
the
key
paragraph
is
paragraph
3
of
section
28
of
the
enabling
act
which
says...
this
is
on
page
50a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
it
says
that
the
leasing
of
any
of
said
lands
in
such
manner
as
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
arizona
may
prescribe
for
mineral
purposes
is
permissible.
and
then
right
after
that,
it
says
the
leasing
of
any
of
said
lands--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--if
you
go
down
to
point
2--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--about
two-thirds
of
the
way
down,
point
2
says
that
the
leasing
of
lands
for
mineral
purposes,
other
than
oil
and
gas,
is
permitted
in
such
manner
as
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
arizona
may
prescribe.
now,
number
3,
right
under
that,
the
next
clause
of
the
same
sentence
says,
"the
leasing
of
any
of
said
lands,
whether
or
not
also
leased
for
other
purposes,
for
the
exploration,
development
and
production
of
oil,
gas
and
other
hydrocarbon
substances.
"
et
cetera...
i
would
like
to
skip
down
a
little...
"may
be
made
in
any
manner
with
or
without
advertisement,
bidding
or
appraisement
and
under
such
terms
and
provisions
as
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
arizona
may
prescribe.
"
looking
at
2
and
3
together,
we
don't
think
it
could
be
more
clear
that
oil
and
gas
leases
may
be
made
without
appraisement,
but
other
mineral
leases,
such
as
those
at
issue
in
this
case,
may
not
be
made
without
appraisement.
and
i
would
like
to
note
that
this
1951...
the
1951
act
totally
revised
all
of
this
sentence.
it
didn't
just
tack
on
part
3.
it...
it
revised
the
whole
thing.
hydrocarbon
and
non-hydrocarbon
mineral
leases
had
previously
been...
been
lumped
together.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
we...
we
don't
think
it
can,
but
we
agree,
first,
that
it
hasn't
and
that
federal
law
makes
that
clear.
and
it
is
also
perfectly
clear
in
this
case
that...
that
the
jones
act
can't
mean
what...
what
asarco
says
it
means.
what
they
draw
from
the
jones
act
is
that
these
lands
aren't
in
the
school
trust.
as
we
note
in
the
last
paragraph
of
our...
of
our
brief,
the
arizona
constitution
makes
absolutely
clear
that
all
lands,
no
matter
how
they
have
been
given
to
the
state,
are
subject
to
the
school
trust.
so,
it's
absolutely
clear
that
these
lands
are
part
of
the
school
trust,
whether
the
jones
act
means
what
they
say
or
not.
and
we
disagree
that
congress
ever
meant
to
do
away
with
all
these
restrictions
in
the
jones
act
as
well.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i'm
sorry.
and
the
state
constitution
also
makes
clear
that
they
are...
that
they
are
subject
to
all
the
restrictions
in...
in
the...
in
the
school
trust.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
if
in
this
case,
the
court
agreed
on
that
jones
act
point,
then
the
conclusion
on
federal
law
is
that
the
enabling
act
is...
is
really
fairly
irrelevant
to
this...
to
this
case.
but
it
would
be
perfectly
clear...
perfectly
clear...
under
arizona
law
that...
that
all
of
the
restrictions
which
are
reprinted
in
the
arizona
constitution
apply,
and...
and
that
this
act...
and
that
the
opinion
below
really
has
no
meaning
except
under
state
law.
and
we
think
that
the...
the
proper
conclusion
then
would
be
to
dismiss
this
case
as
improvidently
granted.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
we
think
you
have
to
leave
the
opinion
intact
for
two
reasons
because
we
think
this
court
lacks
jurisdiction
for
two
reasons.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
if
you
believe
that
the
court
has
jurisdiction,
i
would
nevertheless
think
that
it
was
much
the
better
course
than
dismiss
as
improvidently
granted.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
if
you...
yes,
if
you
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
if
i
may
just
respond
to
that
briefly.
we
think
that
the
recent
development
in
deer
valley
pins
us
down,
but
we
think
it
is
also
quite
clear
from
the
court's
decision
below
which
in
its
holding
mentions
the
arizona
constitution
that...
that
it
would
reach
this
result.
thank
you.
