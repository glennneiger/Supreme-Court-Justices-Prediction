mr.
david
s.
baron
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
i
address
the
merits,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
a
jurisdictional
issue
that
was
raised
before
the
recess,
namely,
the
presence
of
an
independent
and
adequate
state
law
grounds
for
the
decision
below.
as
was
noted,
the
arizona
supreme
court
based
its
decision
not
only
on
the
federal
enabling
act,
but
also
on
the
arizona
constitution.
and
while
we
realize
that
under
michigan
v.
long,
there
is
a
presumption
that
the
federal
ground
is
controlling,
presumptions
can
be
rebutted.
and
there
are
several
factors
that
we
think
do
rebut
that
presumption
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
the
decision
below
by
the
arizona
supreme
court
refers
to
the
arizona
constitution
on
at
least
nine
separate
occasions.
the
remand
order
states
specifically
that
the
trial
court
shall
enter
a
judgment
declaring
the
statute
"unconstitutional
and
invalid".
and
we
then
have
the
subsequent
decision
that
was
mentioned
by
mr.
gribbon,
the
deer
valley
decision,
by
the
arizona
supreme
court
where
that
court
declared
that
in
its
view
the
arizona
constitution
imposes
trust
restrictions
independent
of
and
more
stringent
than
those
in
the
enabling
act.
and
finally,
we
have
the
amicus
brief
now
from
the
state
of
arizona
itself
taking
the
position
that
they
believe...
the
state
of
arizona
now
believes
that
the
arizona
constitution
prohibits
this
royalty
statute
and...
as
an
independent
basis,
and
that
any
decision
by
this
court
under
the
enabling
act
on
this
statute
would,
in
the
state's
words,
be
"purely
academic".
mr.
david
s.
baron
well,
your
honor,
in
michigan
v.
long,
the
court--
mr.
david
s.
baron
--yes,
your
honor.
we
feel--
mr.
david
s.
baron
--the
supreme
court...
arizona
supreme
court
decision
in
the
deer
valley
case
where--
mr.
david
s.
baron
--well,
your
honor,
if...
if
that
decision...
that
is
certainly
one
option,
but
if
that
decision
does,
indeed,
indicate,
as
we
think
it
does,
that
there's
an
independent
and
adequate
state
law
grounds,
then
under
this
court's
precedent,
this
court
would
not
have
jurisdiction
to...
to
address
the
issue
at
all.
and,
therefore--
mr.
david
s.
baron
--no,
your
honor.
there
have
been
no
cases
since
michigan
v.
long
that
we
have
been
able
to
find
suggesting
this--
mr.
david
s.
baron
--well,
your
honor,
in
michigan
v.
long,
this
court
did
indicate
that
the
determination
of
whether
an
independent
ground
existed
was
generally
going
to
be
presumed
against
such
a
finding,
but
it
left
open
the
possibility
specifically
that
the
court
might
find
in
specific
circumstances
that
it
would
be
more
prudent
and...
and
wise
to...
to
defer
to
the
state
ground.
mr.
david
s.
baron
that's--
mr.
david
s.
baron
--that's...
that's
true,
your
honor,
and
i
guess
what--
mr.
david
s.
baron
--well,
as
i
mentioned,
your
honor,
the
arizona
constitution
was
mentioned
nine
times
in
the
opinion,
and
this
court
relied
on
both
state
law
precedent
as
well
as
federal
law
precedent.
mr.
david
s.
baron
that's
true,
your
honor.
and
i
guess
what
we're
arguing
for
is
something
of
a
modification
or...
or
a...
or
a
clarification
of
michigan
v.
long
to
suggest
that
subsequent
development
prior
to
the
time
this
court
decides
a
case
might
make
clear
to
the
court
that
the
jurisprudence
of
the
state
has
established
an
independent
state
ground.
mr.
david
s.
baron
well,
your
honor,
i...
i
suppose
you
could
characterize
it
as
a
change
or
simply
as
a...
as
a
clarification
of
what
michigan
v.
long
meant
when
it
said
that
other
factors
might
be
considered.
mr.
david
s.
baron
well,
your
honor,
i
suppose
we
would
prefer
to
prevail
on
both,
but--
mr.
david
s.
baron
--well,
that's...
that's
certainly
true.
mr.
david
s.
baron
yes,
that's
certainly--
mr.
david
s.
baron
--your
honor,
if
i
understand
the
question,
if...
if
this
court
dismissed
and
remanded
for
further
consideration--
mr.
david
s.
baron
--or
vacated
and
remanded
for
further
consideration,
i...
i
believe
the
state
would
be
perfectly
free
to
make
very
clear
that
it
did
rely
on
an
independent
and
adequate
state
ground
in
this
case.
mr.
david
s.
baron
well,
if
the
remand
from
this
court
was
broad
enough
to
allow
such
a
finding,
then
certainly
they
could
make
such
a--
mr.
david
s.
baron
--that's...
we
would
certainly
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
david
s.
baron
now,
turning
to
the
merits,
this
court
22
years
ago
unanimously
held
that
under
the
arizona
enabling
act,
the
schools
of
arizona
were
to
receive
the
full
benefit
and
the
most
substantial
support
possible
from
the
school
land
grant
to
that
state.
and
the
broad
exemption
that
the
mines
are
asking
for
here
completely
files
in
the
face
of
those
goals.
it
would
allow
the
state
of
arizona
to
continue
to
sell
off
school
trust
minerals
at
one
of
the
lowest
royalty
rates
in
the
nation
and
to,
in
some
cases,
literally
give
them
away,
and
that
is...
cannot
be
what
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
granted
these
lands
in
express
trust
to
the
state
for
the
sole
and...
and
exclusive
benefit
of
the
public
schools.
and
just
to
illustrate
how
this
statute
depletes
the
trust,
i'd
like
to
cite
an
example
from
the
record...
and...
and
this
is
undisputed.
just
south
of
tucson,
one
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
asarco,
incorporated,
operates
a
mine,
part
of
which
is
on
state
school
trust
land
and
part
of
which
is
on
the
tohono
o'odham
indian
reservation.
during
one
10-year
period
recently
in
the
1970s
on
the
state
side
of
that
lease,
the
state
paid
the
flat
5
percent
royalty
on
millions
of
dollars'
worth
of
minerals
they
took
out
of
that
land.
but
on
the
indian
side,
during
the
same
10-year
period,
asarco
paid
royalties
ranging
from
6
to
14
percent
for
minerals.
and
beyond
that,
during
one
month
in
1983,
asarco
paid
no
royalties
whatsoever
on
$2
million
worth
of
trust
minerals
taken
from
the
school
lease
because
the
net
value
of
the
minerals
in
that
month
was
zero,
and
the
royalties
are
calculated
as
a
percentage
of
net
value.
now,
this
is
just
the
kind
of
thing
that
congress
was
trying
to
prevent
when
it
adopted
all
of
these
trust
restrictions.
mr.
david
s.
baron
yes.
mr.
david
s.
baron
that's
certainly
our
position,
your
honor,
and
it's
our
position
that
there
are
really
two
kinds
of
restrictions
in
this
enabling
act.
there
are
the
specific
requirements
for
an
appraisal
in
each
case,
and
there
is
also
the
basic
fiduciary
duties
that
the
state
has
as
a
trustee.
and
here
we
have
argued...
and
we
believe
the
court
below
held...
the
state
has
violated
both
of
those
kinds
of
duties.
and
we
believe
that
this
statute
is
on
its
face
a
violation
of
both
of
those
kinds
of
duties
because
it
limits
the
ability
of
the
state
as
a
trustee
to
obtain
the
optimal
return,
and
it
forces
the
state
to
give
away
these
assets.
it's
not
simply
a
question
of
every
once
in
a
while
there's
a
fluke
and...
and
the
state
incorrectly
manages
the
lands.
the
statute
forces
these
results.
now--
mr.
david
s.
baron
--yes.
it
is
flat
5
percent--
mr.
david
s.
baron
--for
all
leases.
and
it's
the
same
regardless
of
whether
it's
gold
or
sandstone
or...
or
any
other
mineral
or
wherever
it
is
in
the
state.
mr.
david
s.
baron
that
was
enacted
in
1941,
your
honor.
mr.
david
s.
baron
yes.
the
first
mineral
royalty
statute--
mr.
david
s.
baron
--your
honor,
it's
our
position
that
we
have
to
read
the
arizona
enabling
act
as
it
reads
today.
and
the
most
recent
amendment
to
the
arizona--
mr.
david
s.
baron
--no,
no,
your
honor.
it's
our
position,
as
we
stated
in
our
brief,
that
these
lands
have
always
been
subject
to
the
trust
restrictions,
and
that--
mr.
david
s.
baron
--well,
your
honor,
i...
i
know
of
no
principle
that
says
that
congress
cannot
modify
federal
law
to...
to
make
it
more--
mr.
david
s.
baron
--well,
if
i
did,
i
misspoke.
mr.
david
s.
baron
that...
that
is
certainly
not
our
position.
mr.
david
s.
baron
but
i
think--
mr.
david
s.
baron
--i'm
not
sure,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
think
that's
what
happened
here.
i
think
what
happened
here
is
that
subsequent
congressional
legislation
simply
clarified
and...
and
confirmed
what
congressional
intent
was
all
along.
congress
in
1951
made
very
clear
that
it
fait
minerals
had
all
along
been
subject
to
the
trust
restrictions.
mr.
david
s.
baron
no,
but
i
think
in
the
context
of
the
1951
amendment
it
is
pretty
significant.
in
that
amendment,
congress
authorized
the
state
to
enter
into
a
variety
of
leases
all
in
a
manner
to
be
made...
t
to
be
determined
by
the
legislature,
grazing
leases,
agricultural
leases,
oil
and
gas
leases,
and
mineral
leases,
all
in
a
manner
to
be
determined
by
the
legislature.
but
critically,
it
then
went
on
and
specifically
exempted
only
oil
and
gas
leases
from
the
requirement
for
an
appraisal.
no
such
express
exemption
was
given
for
any
other
kind
of
leases,
including
mineral
leases.
and
the...
the
rule
of
construction,
of
course,
is
that
when
congress
specifies
an
exception
to
a
general
rule,
other
exceptions
are
not
to
be
implied.
and...
and
so...
so,
in
this
event,
in
the--
mr.
david
s.
baron
--well,
your
honor,
certainly
it
shows
that,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
it
shows
only
that
because
in
1936
oil
and
gas
leases
were
treated
as
a
subset
of
mineral
leases.
and,
therefore,
in
order
to
exempt
oil
and
gas
leases
from
the
appraisal
requirement,
congress
had
to
specifically
and
deliberately
separate
the
treatment
of
those
two
kinds
of
leases.
so,
i
think
it
says
more
than
simply
what
congress
thought
all
along.
beyond
that,
what...
what
the
mines
base
most
of
their
argument
on
in
this
case
is
the
notion
that
in
allowing
the
states
to
determine
the
manner
of
leasing,
arizona
was
somehow
being
authorized
to...
to
have
completely
free
reign.
but
this
court
in
alamo
land
and
cattle
company...
the
alamo
land
and
cattle
company
case
only
about
12
years
ago,
applied
the
true
value
and
appraisal
requirements
to
grazing
leases
which,
like
mineral
leases,
are
authorized
in
a
manner
as
to
be
determined
by
the
legislature.
and,
indeed,
every
other
court
that
has
addressed
this
question
has
concluded
that
congressional
directions
to
allow
the
states
to
determine
the
method
or
manner
of
leasing
is
not
a
waiver
of
trust
restrictions,
but
rather
an
allowance
for
the
state
to
set
the
details
of
leasing,
things
like
the
term
and
the
method
of
appraisal
and
the
duration
of
leases
and
other
details
of
which
there
are
many
in
these
leasing
situations.
now,
beyond...
beyond
the
specifics,
i
think
it's
fair
to
ask,
having
gone
to
all
of
this
trouble
to
put
all
of
these
explicit
trust
restrictions
around
these
trust
lands
so
that
the
schools
would
get
all
the
benefit,
why
would
congress
then
turn
around
and
exempt
one
of
the
most
valuable
resources.
and
the
only
explanation
the
mines
have
to
offer
is
that
mineral
leases
are
supposedly
impossible
to
appraise.
but
the
simple
fact
is
that
this
court
ruled
in
1890
that
mineral
interests
were
appraisable
although
it's
somewhat
more
difficult
than
other
interests.
and,
in
fact,
it
used
the
same
language
to
authorize
other
kinds
of
leases,
none
of
which
are
claimed
to
be
difficult
to
appraise.
mr.
david
s.
baron
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
the
mines'
argument.
but,
in
any
event,
we
think
the
legislative
history
throughout
is
pretty
conclusive
that
congress
always
intended
these
lands
to
be
used
for
the
schools
and
that...
and
that
the
grant,
for
example,
under
the
jones
act
was
a
grant
confirming
and
by
its
own
terms
extending
the
prior
grants.
and
the
legislative
history
talks
repeatedly
about
desiring
to
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
original
grants.
so--
mr.
david
s.
baron
--that's
true,
your
honor.
but
if
you...
if
you
adopt
the
mines'
view,
then
it's
okay
for
the
state
to
give
these...
these
assets
away
on
occasion.
and
that
is
inconsistent
not
only
with
the
specific
appraisal
requirement,
but
also
with
the
basic
trust
duty
that
the
state
has
as
a
trustee
to
optimize
revenue
and
to
prevent
the
loss
of
trust
assets.
mr.
david
s.
baron
no,
your
honor.
in
fact,
in
their
reply
brief
now
they
concede
that
they
have
such
a
duty.
their
only
response
on
that
question
is
that
there
must
be
some
sort
of
a
finding
below
in
that
kind
of
case
before
you
can
find
a
breach
of
trust.
but
the
cases
are
quite
numerous
in
which
courts
have
found
these
kinds
of
statutory
limits
on
trust
returns
to
be
facially
a
breach
of
trust
because
they
limit
the
ability
of
the
trustee
to
maximize
revenues.
and,
indeed,
no
other
state
has
a
non-negotiable,
fixed
royalty
rate.
and
certainly
no
private
trustee
would
set
a
cap
on
what
he
or
she
could
collect
in
interest
on
trust
investments.
that
is
not
consistent
in
any
way
with
basic
trust
responsibilities.
in
conclusion,
as
i
mentioned
before,
to
say
this
statute
is
allowable
is
to
say
that
the
state
of
arizona
can
literally
give
away
trust
minerals.
there
is
no
question
but
that
is
what
has
happened
in
this
case.
the
statutory
formula
requires
the
state
to
give
away
minerals
where
the
net
value
or
the
costs
of
production
exceed
the
value
of
the
minerals.
and
that
cannot
be
what
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
provided
these
lands
for
the
purpose
of
benefiting
the
schools
of
arizona.
