unknown
speaker
strictly
speaking,
you
mean
lease
the
mineral
lands,
rather
than
lease
the
minerals.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
pretty--
--well,
right
now,
does
arizona
only
use
the...
the
amount
that
comes
from
these
lands?
is
that
all
that
arizona
spends
on
education,
or
is
there--
unknown
speaker
--are
general
tax
funds
expended
as
well?
unknown
speaker
well
then
i
see...
i
see
no
necessary
connection
between
this
at
all.
you...
you
assume
that
when
more
money
comes
in
from
the
lands,
the
state
is
going
to
continue
to
devote
the
same
amount
from
general
revenues?
unknown
speaker
why
is
that
a
reasonable
assumption?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see--
unknown
speaker
--well,
but
reducing
taxes
doesn't
help
you.
reducing
taxes
doesn't
help
you.
i
mean,
you--
unknown
speaker
--you
have
to
say
there's
at
least
a
plausible
belief
that
if
you
get
more
money
from
this...
from
these
lands,
more
money
will
go
to
education
even
though
a
sizable
portion...
most
of
what
now
goes
to
education
is
out
of
general
revenues,
or
how
much
of
it?
unknown
speaker
than
from
the
lands.
unknown
speaker
don't
you
think
it
is
more
reasonable
to
think
that
the
legislature
sets
a
figure,
we
need
this
much
for
education,
and
whatever
shortfall
there
is
in
the
amount
that
we
get
from...
from...
from
the
lands,
we'll
make
up
out
of
general
revenues.
that
seems
to
me
almost--
--your
honor,
i'm
not
clear
that
either
of
us
knows
just
exactly
what
the
revenue...
what
the
legislature
does
or
what
it
might
do
in
the
future.
but
if
they
get
more
money
there,
the
teachers
are
going
to
be
saying
put
that
into
the...
into
the
school
system.
we
need
it
for
computers,
books,
et
cetera.
whereas
the
taxpayers
are
going
to
be
saying
you've
met
your
burden
there.
let's
reduce
the
taxes.
i
suggest
there's
a
good
probability
that
some
or
both
of
that
will
happen.
they
would
split
the
difference,
and
that
both
the
teachers
would
get
something
on
the
quality
of
education
and
the
taxpayers,
who
are
the
other
claimants
here,
would
get
something
or
have
a
reasonable
expectation
of
something
in
the
way
of
taxes.
well,
what
if
you're
right?
what
if
you're
right,
mr.
gribbon,
and
the
money
were
put
into...
into
a
better
supply
of
books?
is
that
a
sort
of
benefit
to
the
teachers
that
would
give
them
standing?
i
can
see
how
a
benefit
that
would
increase
their
salaries
would
give
them
standing,
but
just
better
books
or
a
better
looking
campus,
do
you
think
those
are
the
kind
of
benefits
that
would
confer
standing?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
fully
agree
with
you
about
the
scrap
case.
unknown
speaker
didn't
we
say
in
the
valley
forge
case
that
the
taxpayer
standing
of...
under
flast
v.
cohen
was
going
to
be
limited
to
first
amendment
establishment
clause
claims?
unknown
speaker
except
grand
rapids
was
an
establishment
clause
claim.
unknown
speaker
and
this
isn't.
unknown
speaker
all
you
need
to
win
on
is
one.
unknown
speaker
all...
all
you
need
to
win
on
is
either
the
teachers--
unknown
speaker
--but
that's
true
of
the
opinion
in
doremus
too,
and
we
just
dismissed
certiorari,
didn't
we,
in
doremus?
unknown
speaker
but
i
have
some
difficulty
with
that
problem.
if
you
assume
we
have
no
jurisdiction
because
of
a
lack
of
standing,
why
is
it
different
than
if
the
case...
say
the
case
was
moot
at
the
time
it
reached
the
arizona
supreme
court.
and
they
said,
well,
we
realize
this
is
moot,
but
we
don't
have
to
follow
the
article
iii
rules
that
the
federal
courts
follow.
we
think
it
would
nice
to
enter
a
judgment
here
that
will
be
binding
on
our...
our
government,
and
we're
going
to
do
it
even
though
we
may
not
have
judicial
power
in
the
federal
sense.
could
we
vacate
such
a
judgment?
unknown
speaker
and
they
had
no...
no
jurisdiction
as
a
matter
of
federal...
i
mean,
there
is
no
federal
case
or
controversy,
but
they
enter
some
kind
of
an
order
that
the
state...
that
gives
benefits
to
people
like
this.
how
can
we
vacate
that?
and
what
you
are
assuming
here
is
that
even
there
is
no
standing
and,
therefore,
no
jurisdiction,
we
have...
nevertheless
have
the
power
to
vacate
that
judgment.
unknown
speaker
no,
not
in
a...
from
a
state
court.
not
from
a--
unknown
speaker
--the
enabling
act
reserved
the
mineral
rights.
unknown
speaker
subsection
a
doesn't...
doesn't
have
that,
does
it?
you
say
subsection
a
prevents...
that--
unknown
speaker
--that
prevents
the
sale.
unknown
speaker
could...
could
you
tell
me
what...
what
your
interpretation
of
the
effect
of
"of
the
same
effect"
is?
what...
what
does
"of
the
same
effect"
mean?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
then,
in
other
words,
it's
just
a
redundancy
because
the
last
half
of
the
clause
says
that,
"and
titles
to
such
numbered
minerals
shall
vest
in
the
states
at
the
time
and
in
the
manner.
"
unknown
speaker
whether
you
need
a
patent.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
did
they
ever
remove
the
restrictions
on
non-mineral
lands?
unknown
speaker
that
is
sort
of
strange,
isn't
it,
if
they
have
confidence
in
the
states
about
minerals
which
are
so
much
more
valuable?
unknown
speaker
these
were
the
non-school
land
sections?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gribbon,
may
i
ask?
did...
the
arizona
supreme
court,
i
think,
said
that
both
the
enabling
act
and
the
state
constitution
were
violated
by...
by
the...
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
and
i
noticed
the
states
abandoned
the
statute,
but
it
supports
the
brief
for
the
respondents
and
argues
that
that's
a
independent
state
ground.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
any
event,
do
you
think
they've
satisfied
the
requirement
of
michigan
and
long
and--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
gribbon,
you...
you...
you
assert,
if
i...
if
i
understand
your
analysis
correctly,
a
dual
regime
for
mineral
lands
then
in
arizona.
unknown
speaker
some,
those
that
contained
unknown
minerals
in
1910,
are...
continue
to
be
subject
to
the
regime
of
the
1910
act,
and
the
other
ones
that
were
granted
in
1927
are
not.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
gribbon.
mr.
baron,
we'll
hear
from
you
now.
unknown
speaker
well,
sometimes
when
something
has
happened
between
the
time
we've
granted
or
noted
jurisdiction
that
indicates
the
decision
might
be
different,
we
vacate
and
remand
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
some...
that
subsequent
event.
and
you
think
the
subsequent
event
is
the
decision
in
another
case?
unknown
speaker
is
that...
how
about
my
question?
is
there
something
that
has
happened
since
we...
since
the
decision
in
this
case
that
indicates
that
there's
a
state
ground?
unknown
speaker
what
is
it?
unknown
speaker
why
shouldn't
we
remand
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
that
decision?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
when
you
say
that...
that
there
is
an
independent
state
law
ground,
that
isn't
our
law.
it...
our
law
is
that
the...
the
decision
below
must
have
been
rested
upon
an
independent
state
law
ground--
--right.
--not
that
an
independent
one
existed
in
the
abstract
which
might
have
been
used
but
was
not.
do
you
have
any
case
of
ours
that...
that
even
suggests
that?
unknown
speaker
or
before,
or
in
michigan
v.
long.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
inquiry
was
always
whether
this
state
court
rested
its
decision
on
the
ground,
not
whether
it
might
have--
unknown
speaker
--not
whether
such
a
ground
was
available,
but
whether
it
was
used.
isn't
that--
unknown
speaker
--and
was
it
used
here?
is
there
any...
any
suggestion
at
all
that
it
was
used
here,
any
basis
for
thinking
it
was
used
by
the
lower
court
here,
by
the
arizona
supreme
court,
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
baron,
it
seemed
to
me
the...
almost
98
percent
of
the
discussion
in
the
opinion
of
justice
feidman
was
of
the
enabling
act
and
the
other
statutes,
and
there's
just
almost
no
discussion
of
the
arizona
constitution.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
would
be
a
change,
i
think
as
justice
scalia
suggests.
it
would
be
a
change
from
saying
did
the
opinion
in
this
case
rest
on
an
adequate
state
ground
to
could
it
have
rested
on
an
independent
state
ground.
unknown
speaker
do
you
care
whether
you
prevail
on
the
federal
ground
or
the
state
ground?
unknown
speaker
yes,
you
would
like
the
benefit
of
this
decision
below
without
having
it
reviewed
here.
unknown
speaker
that's
like
an
independent
state
ground
is
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
except
that
it
wasn't
used
in
this
case.
well,
mr.
baron,
suppose
we...
we
disagreed
with
you
and
thought
that
michigan
and
long
had
not
been
satisfied
here
and
that
when
it
hadn't
decided
the
federal
grounds.
and
then
we
sent
it
back
under
our
usual
form
of
remand
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
our
opinion.
would
the
state
court
be
free
then
to
say,
all
right,
if
we
can't
have...
we're
not
going
to
look
at
the
state
ground
and
say
that
we'll
reinstate
our
judgment
on
the
basis
of
the
holding
of
unconstitutionality
under
the
state
constitution?
could
that
be
done?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
even
though
we...
we
here
found
that
we
can't
say
that
michigan
and
long
have
been
satisfied
in
respect
of
a
holding
that
it
was...
rested
on
a
state
law
ground.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
doesn't
matter
what
we
say.
they
have
the
power
to
enforce
their
own
constitution.
we
couldn't
prevent
them.
the
courts
have
done
that
several
times,
and
this
court
has
taken
jurisdiction,
reversed
on
the
federal
court.
the
opperman
case...
there
are
three
or
four
of
those
cases
where
we
managed
to
write
advisory
opinions
by
following
this
procedure.
but
that's
perfectly
within
their
power.
unknown
speaker
sure.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
even...
even
without
the
specific
restrictions
contained,
wouldn't...
wouldn't
there
be
some
action
if
it
were
shown
that
even
though
you
don't
have
to
establish
the
value
beforehand,
you
are
not
dealing
responsibly
with
these
lands?
i
mean,
even...
even
under...
even
under
petitioners'
theory,
it's
acknowledged
that...
that
these
mineral
rights
have
to
be
used
for
the
benefit
of
the
schools.
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
so,
wouldn't
you...
wouldn't
you
have
a
cause
of
action
of
some
sort
against
outrageous
giving
away
of
the
lands
without
giving
the
money
to
schools
at
all?
unknown
speaker
does
the
statute
set
the
royalty
percentage?
unknown
speaker
five
percent.
unknown
speaker
and
when
did
that
become
a
part
of
the
law?
unknown
speaker
nineteen
forty-one.
unknown
speaker
it's
not
clear
to
me
how
these
subsequent
statutes
bear
upon
the
interpretation
of
the
1926
act
in
any
event.
unknown
speaker
well,
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
i
assume
that
if
the
federal
government
grants
a
certain
ownership
and
prerogative
with
respect
to
its
lands,
it
can't
later
make
it
more
restrictive.
or
am
i
in
error?
you're
not
saying
that
the
subsequent
statutes
made
more
restrictive
the
terms
on
which
the
states
held
the
lands,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
but
if
that's
true,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
to
focus
on
the
1926
and
the
1910
statutes.
unknown
speaker
well,
you've
just
conceded
it
can't
make
it
more
restrictive.
unknown
speaker
and--
unknown
speaker
--so,
you
think
that
if
the
states--
unknown
speaker
--if
the
states...
assuming
arguendo,
if
the
states
had
the
authority
to
enter
these
leases
in
1926,
could
the
federal
government
pass
legislation
depriving
the
states
of
that
authority
in
1941?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
assume
we
can
give
that
weight
as
congressional
reading
of
its
early
statute,
but
it's
not
binding,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well...
well,
do
you
agree
that
the
most
that
shows
is
that
congress
interpreted
its
earlier
statutes
as
prohibiting
these
leases?
and
it's
just
a
question
of
whether
congress'
interpretation
is
right.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
their
explanation
was
really
quite
different;
namely,
that
it
was
a
different
congress,
which
your
argument
doesn't
seem
to
acknowledge.
the
congress...
the
1951
congress
was
not
the
1926
congress
which
was
not
the
1910
congress.
and
each
of
them
feels
quite
differently
about
whether
the
states
ought
to
have
these
mineral
rights
and
what
the
restrictions
ought
to
be.
i
mean,
you
speak
of
congress
as
though
it's
one
continuing
body
there.
it
isn't.
it's
a
different
congress,
different
people,
different
views
about
what
the
states
ought
to
have.
unknown
speaker
but
the
mines
don't
argue
that
the
proceeds
of
these
grants
shouldn't
be
used
for
the
schools.
it's
just
a
question
of
a
leasing
procedure.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
understand
the
petitioners
to
argue
there
is
no
such
duty
as
the
one
to
which
you...
you
last
referred
to?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
baron.
mr.
wright,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
one
can
argue
that
our
cases
long
ago
have
drained
it
of
most
of
its
meaning
i
think.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
xxx.
how
different
is
this
is,
mr.
wright,
from
the
duquesne
case
where
i
think,
in
effect,
we
said
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
decided
finally
it
wasn't
going
to
change
its
mind
on
a
question
of
federal
law?
can't
you
say
the
same
thing
about
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
here?
they're
not
going
to
change
their
mind
about
the
fact
that
the
enabling
act
makes
the
state
statute
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
the...
the
respondents
don't
join
you
in
this
argument,
do
they?
unknown
speaker
then
the...
your
answer
to
my
question
is,
no,
they
do
not
join
you
in
this
argument.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
you...
you
may
lose
on
this...
on
this--
unknown
speaker
--opposition
and
you're
going
to
cover
the
merits
anyway.
unknown
speaker
whereabouts
on
page
50a
are
you--
unknown
speaker
--okay.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think,
mr.
wright,
in
following
up
justice
kennedy's
question,
that
the
government
can
come
along
many
years
after
the
enabling
act
and
impose
more
arduous
conditions
on
the
state's
alienation
than
it
did
in
the
enabling
act?
unknown
speaker
i
don't...
i
don't
understand
they
are
saying
that
these
lands
are
not
subject
to
the
school
trust.
the
jones
act
itself
makes
them
subject
to
the
school
trust.
you
don't
have
to
go
to
the
state
constitution.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
very
interesting,
but
i
don't
see
what
that
has
to
do
with
whether
the
federal
government
has
made
them
subject
to
those...
to
those
restrictions.
unknown
speaker
but
leave
it...
leave
the
opinion
in...
intact?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
suppose
we
disagree
with
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
we
have
the
power
to...
we
certainly
have
the
power
to
reverse
it--
unknown
speaker
--and
have
the
power
to
vacate
it
for
some
good
reason,
like
there
has
been
some
development
in
arizona
law
that
maybe
would
make
this
constitutional
decision
unnecessary.
