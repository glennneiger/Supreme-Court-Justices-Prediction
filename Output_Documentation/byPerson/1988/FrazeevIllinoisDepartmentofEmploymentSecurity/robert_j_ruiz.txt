mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
response
to
an
issue
raised
by
counsel,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
it
has
been
the
consistent
position
of
the
state
that
this
is
a
matter
that
relates
strictly
to
the
factual
determination
made
by
the
courts
below
as
well
as
by
the
board
of
review
throughout
its
administrative
proceeding.
the
case
does
not
involve
the
constitutional
issue
raised,
but
simply
involves
the
issue
of
whether
mr.
frazee
was
properly
denied
his
unemployment
insurance
benefits
based
on
his
refusal
to
accept
suitable
work
and
whether
that
refusal
was
based
on
a
personal
desire
not
to
work
on
sunday
or
as
part
of
a
religious
tenet
that
he
held.
the
simple
statement
that
he
asserts,
that
i
am
a
christian,
we
assert
is
insufficient
as
a
matter
of...
of
religious
belief,
as
we
understand
it,
and
insufficient
to
trigger
the
protections
of
the
free
exercise
clause.
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
we
assert
that
what
the
court
held
below
is
correct
and
proper,
and
that
is
that
based
on
the
record
and
administrative
review
that
it
had,
it
had
to
uphold
the
decision
below
unless
it
found
it
against
the
manifest
weight
of
the
evidence.
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
the
administrative
body?
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
no,
it
did
not.
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
the
court
did
not
at
any
time
say
that
this
was
a
religious
belief.
it
did
not
question
mr.
frazee's
sincerity,
but
i
think
it
upheld
the
board's
determination
and
the
hearing
referee's
determination
that
his
refusal
to
work
was
a
matter
of
personal
preference
and
not
religious
belief.
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
it's
our
position
that
what
the
court
did
in
talking
about
tenets
and
dogma
was
simply
a
way
of
dealing
with
the
fact
that
it
was
dealing
with
a
very
scant
record
concerning
mr.
frazee's--
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
--no,
that
would
not
be
our...
our
position.
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
our...
our
position
is,
first
of
all,
that
we
don't
agree
that
that's
what
the--
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
--holding
below
is.
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
secondly,
that
this
court,
if
it
were
to
determine
that
this
were,
in
fact,
a
matter
of
law
and
not
of
fact,
could
under
its
de
novo
powers
review
the
entire
record
and
make
its
own
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
a
denial
of
constitutional
right.
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
however,
we
would
submit
that
even
under
that
de
novo
review
standard...
first
of
all,
there
are
not
sufficient
facts
here
to
support
the
contention
that
the
free
exercise
clause
has
been
violated.
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
no,
we
do
not.
i
don't
think
that
is
a
proper
statement
of
the
law.
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
well,
our
reading
of
that...
of
that
language
is
simply
dicta
in
the
case
because
it
was
not
determinative
of
the
record
that
the
court
had
before
it.
and
i
think--
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
--no,
i
don't
think
you...
you
need
to
reverse.
you
may
still
uphold
the
finding.
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
well,
it's
not
our
position
that...
that
the
decision
is
patently
in
error--
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
--no,
i
think
you
can
still
uphold
the
determination
that
mr.
frazee--
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
--pardon
me?
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
that
mr.
frazee
was
not
entitled
to
benefits
given
the...
the
factual
presentation
he
made
to
support
his
claim
of
religious
belief.
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
i
don't
think
you
need
to
redetermine
the
facts.
if
you
determine
that...
that
the
decision
was
wrongly
decided
by
the
appellate
court,
you
may
review
the
facts
and
make
your
own
determination
of
what
those--
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
--well,
it
has
been
our
position
consistently
that
that's
not
the
issue
that
these
facts
present.
we
did
it
throughout
the
course--
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
--that
you
need
to
be
a
member
of
an
organized
religion
and--
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
--have
tenets
and
dogma?
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
in
order
to
get
constitutional
protection?
absolutely
not.
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
and
i
don't
think
the
appellate
court--
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
--no.
we
do
not
believe
that
that's
what
the
court
said.
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
yes.
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
we
have
i
think
conceded
the
point
that
this
gentleman
may
have
had
some
sincere
beliefs.
what
we
are
unwilling
to
concede
is
whether
he
presented
sufficient
evidence
to
support
his
claim
that
on
the
basis
of
the
record
that
he
made,
he
could
support
a
claim
of...
of
religious
exemption.
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
i
think
the
state
court
did
do
it
by
affirming
the
holding
below
that
he
was
not
entitled--
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
--we
have
conceded
that...
that
nowhere
along
the
line
has
his
sincerity
been
questioned.
our
contention
is
that
there
are
not
enough
facts
in
this
scant
record
to
support
the
fact
that
he
put
forth
a
religious
claim.
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
oh,
the
reason
is
because
i
think
that
under
any
sort
of
constitutional
analysis
to
determine
whether
or
not
you
have
the
protection
of
the
equal
protection
clause
attaching,
you
need
to
look
at
what
the
assertions
are
of
the
plaintiff.
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
the--
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
--no,
it
does
not.
it
does
not.
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
i
think
in
this
instance
he
failed
to
prove
that
he
had
anything
other
than
a
personal
belief,
a
personal
preference.
it
could
have
been
as
sincere
as
the
courts
have
pointed
out
that
he
was
perhaps
sincere.
but
the
issue
is
that
you
cannot
raise
the
claims
even
though
he
asserts
them
as
being
religious
simply
on
the
basis
of
his
representations.
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
he
has
not
shown
that
what
he
has
presented
is
a
sincere
religious
belief.
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
what
could
he
have
shown?
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
i
think--
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
--i
think
that
he
could
have
done
any
number
of
things
to
provide
additional
information
to--
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
--the
things
that
he
could
have
done...
he
was
offered
enough
of
an
opportunity.
if
his
particular
religious
orientation
was
not
of
the
institutional
variety,
as
has
been
indicated,
then
he
could
have
taken
the
opportunity
to
expound
more
on
where
he
got
the
religious
direction
for
his
life,
how
long
he
has
had
it,
what
kinds
of
practices
does
he
do--
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
--pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
i...
i
think--
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
--well,
this
was
not--
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
--an
adversarial
proceeding.
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
this
was
not
an
adversarial
proceeding,
your
honor,
at...
at
the
hearing
level
where
the
record
was
made.
he
was
brought
in
to
respond
to
the
fact
that
his
benefits
were
going
to
be
discontinued.
and
he
was
asked
for
the
reason
for
his
refusal
to
work--
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
--i
think...
pardon
me.
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
i
think
that
was
his
response
exactly.
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
it
is
our
position
that
it
is
not
simply--
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
--we
do
not
question
his
sincerity
simply
because
the...
the
record
doesn't
show
that
he
was
in
any
way
insincere
about
it.
our...
our
position
is
that
simply
saying
that
i
have
these
personal
preferences
or
i
have
these
preferences
and--
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
--[inaudible]
religious--
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
--that...
that
they
are
religious
doesn't
make
them
so,
that
the
person
seeking
the
exemption,
seeking
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment
bears
the
responsibility
of
illustrating
that
what
he
holds
and
believes
as
his
own
is,
in
fact,
what
would
be
recognized
under
the
free
exercise
clause.
the...
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
the
reality
is
that
the
farther
one
gets
away
from
what
could
easily
be
recognized
as
an
identifiable
religion,
i
think
as
a
practical
matter
requires
that
the
individual
illustrate
more
how
those
beliefs,
that
body
of
beliefs,
not
a
single
one,
somehow
is
the
controlling
factor
in
his
life
and
holds
the
same
position
as
an
orthodox
belief
in
god
would
hold
in
someone
else.
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
the
argument
made
at
the
state
level
was
that
the
decision
below
should
have
been
affirmed.
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
no,
it
was
not.
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
i
think
that
you
can
make
the...
the
assumption
that
simply
because
someone
says
i
don't
want
to
work
on
sunday
and
attaches
a
religious
label
to
it,
that
that
immediately
means
that...
that
the
fact
finder--
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
--i
think
you've
established
a
religious
belief
in
your
honor's
example,
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
set
of
facts
we
had
here.
i
think
that
he
was
asked
to
identify
either
an
organized
religion,
which
he
said
there
was
none,
or
to
identify
something
that
we
could
look
at
and
say,
okay,
this
is
comparable
to
what
we
would
identify
as
a
religious
belief.
i
think
the
state
in
this
instance
has
the
right
to
make
the
determination
as
to
the
sincerity
and
also
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
dealing
with
something
religious,
and
simply
having
it
labeled
as
a
religion
does
not
make
it
so.
i
think
you
need
a
lot
more.
that
runs
contrary
to
our
notion
that
anyone
can
simply
set
up
a
set
of
standards
and
expect
that
society
will
know
what
those
standards
are,
under
the
label
of
christianity
in
this
case,
and
then
ask
society
to
abide
by
one's
wishes
as
to
the
exercise
of
that
whether
or
not
it
means
society
has
to
bestow
benefits
on
it.
i
think
that
our
notion
of...
of
ordered
liberty
says
that
you
can't
do
that,
and
that
this
court
can't
be
asked
to
simply,
on
the
basis
of
this
record,
provide
a
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
was
the
state?
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
simply
on
the
basis
of
his
religious
beliefs?
no.
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
i
think
we
probably
could
have
done
that
if...
because
we
would
contend
that
it
neither
approves
nor
diminishes
his...
his
record.
he
does
not
illustrate
any
sort
of
religious
belief.
and
if
the
hearing
officer
had
so
found,
i
think
that
that
could
have
been
reversed
as
well.
it's
our
position
that
the
history
and
purpose
and
intent
of
the
free
exercise
clause,
if
it
is
to
be
preserved,
then
we
must
undertake
the
rather
delicate
task
of
distinguishing
between
those
things
that
are
religious
and
those
that
are
non-religious.
the
receipt
of
unemployment
insurance
benefits
in
illinois
is
a
constitutional...
or
pardon
me...
a
conditional
right
and
not
an
absolute
right.
the
right
to
receive
those
is
dependent
upon
the
claimant,
in
this
case
mr.
frazee,
showing
his
initial
eligibility
for
those
benefits
and
a
continuing
eligibility.
that
burden
was
his
from
the
beginning
and
it
continued
to
be
his
throughout
the
process.
it
never
shifted.
his
decision
to
decline
sunday
employment
and
thereby
claim
a
religious
exemption
was
dependent
on
his
ability
to
demonstrate
that
the
refusal
was
more
than
a
sincere
personal
belief,
that
it
was,
in
fact,
religious.
simply
labeling
his
preference
as
religious
didn't
make
it
so.
at
the
hearing,
as
i
have
illustrated
before,
he
had
made...
there
were
a
number
of
attempts
made
to
draw
out
the
nature
of
his
beliefs
with
very
little
information
gathered.
he
was
asked
what
his
faith
was.
he
simply
said
it
was
christian.
he
asked
what
church
he
belonged
to,
to
which
he
didn't
respond.
he
asked
if
there
were
tenets
of
the
church
that
prohibited
it.
he
said,
no,
that
just
as
a
christian,
i
feel
it's
wrong.
when
asked
to
add
his
own
thoughts
about
the
record...
to
add
anything
before
the
hearing
was
closed,
he
declined
and
simply
left.
i
think
that
based
on
the
evidence,
there
was
nothing
else
that
the
hearing
officer
could
do
but
to
deny
him
his
claim
of
benefits
because
he
had
simply
declined
an
offer
of
suitable
employment
and
that
he
had
failed
to
show
that
for
either
a
religious
reason
or
any
other
reason
that
the
job
was
unsuitable
for
him.
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
well,
i
think...
i
think
the
attempt
here
that
was
made
to
try
and
point
out
whether
he
was
a
member
of
a
religious
organization...
i
think
membership
in
an
organization
not
only
would
point
to
the
religious
nature
of
the
beliefs,
but
also
to
the
sincerity.
so,
i
think
it's...
it's
a
two-part
thing.
and
i
think
that
you
can
say
simply
because
someone
sincerely
holds
a
belief
doesn't
make
it
religious,
and
simply
labeling
the
belief
as
religious
also
doesn't
make
it
religious.
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
if
that
is
a
religious
belief
beyond
simply
saying
that
it's...
it's
a
religious
belief,
then
you
then
look
to
the
sincerity.
here
we
have
a
claim
that...
that
was
sincere.
what
we
don't
have
is
why
was
he
told
that.
where
does
this
particular
belief
hold
a
place
in
his
life?
what
activities
would
be
proper?
religion
is
sort
of
measured
against
the
standards
of...
of
either
beliefs,
certain
tenets
that
say
certain
conduct
is
proper,
other
is
prohibited,
other
is
better
and
worse
or
whatever.
there
is
no
explanation
here
of
his
declining
to
work
on
sunday
other
than
his
single
statement,
i
think
it's
wrong.
much
of
an
explanation
as
to
why
he
believes
that.
what...
what
place
does
he
hold?
how
long
has
he
held
it?
all
these
go
to
point
to
whether
or
not
we're
dealing
with
something
that
is
really
religious
or
whether
it's
something
else.
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
i
would
apologize
to
justice
scalia,
but
i
think
that
the...
the
record
here
illustrates--
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
--another
way
to
measure
sincerity?
or--
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
--our
argument
is
basically
that
whether
or
not
one
accepts
the
notion
that
he
was
sincere,
which
has
not
been
brought
into
question,
that
this
record
fails
to
establish
that
there
was
a
religious
belief.
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
in
measuring
a
religious
belief?
no,
it
is
very
important.
i'm
just
saying
that
under
these
facts,
sincerity
wasn't
questioned.
but
the
sincerity
of
a
personal
belief
is
not
the
same
as
the
sincerity
of
a
religiously
held
belief,
and
that
the
courts
below
have
not
determined
that
on
the
record
here
we
have
sufficient
evidence
to
support
his
claim
of
a
religious
belief.
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
the
sincerity
point?
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
i
think
there
was
a
determination
at
the
board
of
review
level
saying
while
we
don't
question
his
sincerity--
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
--his
sincerity?
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
i
think
the...
mr.
frazee
claims
his
sincerity.
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
sincerity?
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
i
think
it
was
conceded
throughout--
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
--we
have
not
raised
the
sincerity
issue.
we
have
illustrated--
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
--the
court
below
did
say
that
they
didn't
doubt
his
sincerity.
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
we
did
not
raise
it,
no.
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
i
think
the
court
was
making
comments
about
his
sincerity
just
in
the
same
way
that
the
court
delved
into
the...
the
sort
of
historical
evolution
of
the
place
that
sunday
has
historically.
we
are
trying
not
to
delve
into
that
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument.
we
would
like
to
sort
of
take
a
moment
and
ask
the
court
to
consider
the
fact
that
this
and
other
courts
have
in
a
variety
of
contexts
undertaken
the
task
of
determining
whether
or
not
given
a
particular
set
of
facts
they
were
looking
at
a
religious
claim,
whether
it
was--
mr.
robert
j.
ruiz
--well,
we...
we
raise
before
this
court
in
our
motion
to
dismiss
the
notion
that
given
this
set
of
facts,
there
was
not
a
constitutional
question
that
was...
that
was
raised.
and
we
still
believe
that
this
court
can
support
the
holding
below
and,
if
it
wishes,
make
a
determination
that
the
court
erred
in
the
way
that
it
arrived
at
its
determine
as
to
constitutional
question.
i
think
that
would
be
a...
an
appropriate
holding
if
the
court
so
wishes.
we
would
suggest
that
applying
several
of
the
tests
that
this
court
and
other
courts
have
used
to
determine
the
presence
or
the
existence
of
a
religious
belief,
that
it
can
be
determined
that
in
this
particular
set
of
facts,
mr.
frazee
did
not
raise
claim
that
implicates
the
first
amendment.
if
the
belief
must
be
stated
in
a
manner
that
can
be
objectively
understood
to
be
religious,
what
we
have
in
this
instance
is
mr.
frazee
claiming
a
mantle
of
christianity
and
simply
saying
that
he
expects
the
finder
of
fact
to
make
a
determination
that
the
certain
body
of
beliefs
associated
with
that
and
that
his
sincerity
as
to
those
beliefs
should
go
unquestioned.
it's
incumbent
upon
the
fact
finder
in
that
instance
to
be
presumed
to
have
a
certain
body
of
knowledge
as
to
what
all
of
the...
the
rights,
responsibilities
and
duties
of
an
adherent
to
christianity
are
and,
number
one,
what
this
particular
individual
holds
as
his
own.
secondly,
that
the
belief
must
be
relevant
to
the
purpose
that
it
is
invoked.
all
that
we
would
suggest
is
that
one
recognizes
that
there
are
a
variety
of
beliefs
that
may
be
suggested
under
the
term
"christianity".
not
all
sects
to
christianity
hold
the
sabbath
or
the
sunday
sacred.
we
must
look
to
see
whether
or
not
this
particular
individual
claims
to
have
that
as
his
important
tenet
of
religion.
thirdly,
and
this
is
in
response
perhaps
to
something
raised
earlier,
that
if
you
don't
have
something
that
is
identifiable
as
a
religious
organization
familiar
to
the
judeo-christian
ethic,
that
you
look
at
what
place
this
body
of
beliefs
holds
in
the
life
of
this
individual,
whether
it
occupies
a
place
that
would
be
similar
to
the
belief
in
god
in
someone
else,
and
make
a
determination
that
there
is
a
religious
belief
even
though
it
does
not
look
like
the
familiar
religions
that
we
may
be
accustomed
to
seeing,
thereby
allowing
minority
religions
to
have
the
same
evenhanded
treatment
as
majority
religions.
if
the
free
exercise
clause
is
to
be
preserved,
then
one
must
accept
the
notion
that
it
is
not
self-executing.
those
seeking
free
exercise
protection
are
not
burdened,
nor
their
rights
diminished
if
they
are
asked
that
they
assert
those
rights
in
terms
that
are
sufficiently
clear
and
in
a
context
consistent
with
their
established
purpose.
what
frazee
would
like
the
fact
finder
to
do
in
this
instance
on
the
basis
of
an
insufficient
record
is
to
infer
facts,
assume
beliefs
and
then
apply
his
subjective
understanding
to
the
terms
"i
am
a
christian".
this
result
should
be
avoided.
to
do
so
would
mean
that
it
would
deprive
individuals
who
are
entitled
to
first
amendment
protection
of
that
protection
and
wrongfully
bestow
it
on
others
who
would
not
qualify
for
it.
thank
you.
