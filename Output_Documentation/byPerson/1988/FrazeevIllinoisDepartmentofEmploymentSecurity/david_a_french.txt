mr.
david
a.
french
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
does
the
free
exercise
clause
extend
protection
only
to
persons
who
are
members
of
established
religious
organizations
and
who
exercise
the
beliefs
of
those
organizations?
that's
the
issue
this
case
presents.
william
a.
frazee
believes
it's
wrong
to
perform
nonessential
work
on
sunday.
his
beliefs
are
based
on
his
religious
convictions
as
a
christian.
now,
nonessential
to
mr.
frazee
means
any
work
that
does
not
directly
relate
to
the
preservation
of
human
life.
in
1984,
he
worked
for
the
state
of
illinois
and
was
laid
off,
and
during
that
time
he
remained
on
call
to
return
to
his
position.
in
addition,
he
performed
temporary
employment
through
kelly
services,
incorporated,
and
performed
all
assignments
that
were
given
to
him
until
april
of
198--
mr.
david
a.
french
--well,
the
record
shows
that
he
had...
he
testified
during
the
hearing
that
he
had
one
assignment
previous
to
the
job
that
came
up
in
april
of
1984,
and
then
there
was
one
afterwards.
so,
in
fact,
the...
he
had
two
assignments.
in...
on
april
of
1984,
he
was
given
a
five...
an
offer
of
a
five-day
position
beginning,
he
was
told,
wednesday,
may
9,
and
going
through
sunday,
may
13,
1984.
the
position
was
a
retail
clothing
position,
salesman.
when
he
was
informed
that
the
work
included
sunday
work,
he
inquired
as
to
whether
the
work
could
be
limited
from
wednesday
through
saturday,
and
was
informed
that
unless
the...
he
was
available
for
sunday
work,
he
wouldn't
be
considered
for
the
position.
at
that
time,
he
declined
the
employment,
citing
his
religious
belief
against
sunday
labor.
now,
after
that,
mr.
frazee
attempted
to
obtain
continuing
unemployment
benefits
from
the
department
of
employment
security.
during
the
proceedings,
he
at
all
times
acted
pro
se.
the
first...
and
i
should
say
the
illinois
statute
that
we
have
before
the
court
today
is
very
similar
to
the
statutes
that
this
court
considered
in
the
sherbert
and
the
thomas
cases.
in
order
to
remain
eligible
for
unemployment
benefits
under
the
illinois
statute,
a
person
must
not
refuse
an
offer
of
suitable
work
without
good
cause.
it's
almost
the
exact
language
of
the
statute
in
thomas.
mr.
david
a.
french
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
i
would
make
two
points
in
response
to
that.
first
of
all,
this
was
the
first
time
the
department
has
raised
this
issue.
throughout
the
lower
court
proceedings,
they
urged
the
lower
courts
to
take
the
position
that
the
illinois
appellate
court
ultimately
took,
first
of
all.
and
secondly,
i
would
say...
and
i'd
like
to
address
this
more
completely
as
i
get
into
the
argument,
but
for
now
i
would
say
that
their
position
both
mischaracterizes
the
record
in
this
case
and
confuses
the
issues
of
the
fact
and
law
that
are
before
this
court
for
determination.
but
that's
the
short
answer
to
your
question,
and
i
would
like
to
explore
it
more
fully.
mr.
david
a.
french
well--
mr.
david
a.
french
--that's
right,
but
i
would
say
that,
first
of
all,
there's...
and
i'll
reach
that
directly.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that...
that
this
court
would
not
have
to
overturn
any
factual
determination
that
was
made
by
the
administrative
agency
in
order
to
overturn
the...
the
decision
of
the
illinois
appellate
court.
the
courts...
the
agency
and
the...
the
illinois
appellate
court
both
made
clear
that
mr.
frazee's
belief
were...
beliefs
were
religious
in
nature
and
that
they
were
sincere.
and
i
will
demonstrate
that
as
we
proceed.
and
that
gets
directly
to
the
point
that
throughout
the
administrative
proceedings,
mr.
frazee's
sincerity
was
never
questioned
in
this
case.
the
first
person
that
he
presented
his
claim
to
under...
under
the
statute
was
the
claims
adjudicator,
and
that
claims
adjudicator
made
this
express
finding
that
was
the
determination
he
was
required
to
make
under
the
illinois
statute.
"on
april
30,
1984,
the
claimant
refused
an
offer
of
work
with
kelly
services,
incorporated,
because
he
did
not
want
to
work
on
sunday
due
to
his
religious
conviction.
"
the
claims
adjudicator
didn't
have
any
problem
identifying
mr.
frazee's
beliefs
as
being
religiously
based.
and
when
mr.
frazee's
claim
was
rejected
by
the
claims
adjudicator,
he
appealed
to
the
referee
and
had
a
hearing
before
the
referee.
the
referee
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
claims
adjudicator
on
all
issues.
and
at
that
hearing
mr.
frazee
responded
to
the
questions
of
the
referee
without
benefit
of
counsel.
now,
the
transcript
will
show
that
the
referee
wasn't
concerned
about
mr.
frazee's
sincerity
at
all.
he
was
only
concerned
about
two
issues:
first,
whether
mr.
frazee
was
a
member
of
an
established
religious
organization;
and
secondly,
whether
he
was
exercising
the
beliefs
of
an
established
religious
organization.
that
was
the
entire
focus
of
the
referee's
questioning
during
the
hearing
about
mr.
frazee's
religious
beliefs.
when
that
was...
when
the...
or
excuse
me...
when
the
referee
upheld
the
decision
of
the
claims
adjudicator,
mr.
frazee
appealed
to
the
board
of
review,
and
once
again
his
sincerity
was
not
at
issue.
the
board
specifically
ruled
that
mr.
frazee's
beliefs
were
not
protected
no
matter
how
strong
or
sincerely
held.
and
i'd
emphasize
here
that
what
the
board
had
in
front
of
it
at
the
time
it
made
its
determination
was
more
than
just
the
testimony
that
mr.
frazee
presented
at
the...
at
the
hearing.
it
had
two
written
statements
that
mr.
frazee
presented
during
the
course
of
the
administrative
proceedings.
and
contrary
to
the
claims
of
the
department
here,
what
that
evidence
showed
is
a
lot
more
than
mr.
frazee
just
saying
i'm
a
christian
and...
and
i
can't
work
on
sunday.
in
fact,
the
two
written
statements
showed
that
his
beliefs
were
derived
from
his
own
personal
reading
of
the
bible,
relying
first
on
the
commandments
contained
in
the
decalogue
and
secondly
on
the
actions
of
christ
in
the
new
testament.
there
is
no--
mr.
david
a.
french
--that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
and
actually
that's
kind
of
a
puzzling
statement.
until...
i
think
when
you
read
it
in
context,
what
it's
referring
to
when
they're
saying
there
he
didn't
produce
any
evidence
corroborating
his
beliefs,
it's
referring...
the
corroboration
that
they
were
asking
for
and
were
looking
for
was
that...
the
corroboration
of
the...
of
a
established
religious
organization
that
that
tenet
was
found
in
an
established
organization
didn't
refer
specifically
to
the
evidence
he
was
presenting
in
my...
in
my
judgment.
i
think
that's
the
fair
reading
of...
of
the
decision.
or,
otherwise,
if
in
fact
that
was
the
basis
of
the
board's
decision,
there
would
have
been
no
need
for
the
board
to...
to
say
whatsoever
that
in
order
to...
for
a
claimant
to
get
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment,
that
you
have
to
show
that
you're
a
member
of...
of
a
denomination
or
church
organization.
and
they
made
that
ruling
specifically
and
expressly
that
when
a
refusal
to
work
is
based
on
religious
convictions,
it
must
be
based
solely
on
the
fact
that
the
person
is
exercising
the
beliefs
of
an
established
religious
organization.
so,
i
think
when...
when
read
properly
in
context,
what
that
statement
by
the
board
is
referring
to
is
the
fact
that
mr.
frazee
didn't
establish
that
he
was
exercising
the
belief
of
an
established
religious
organization.
but
this
was
the
evidence,
the
evidence
that
i've
mentioned,
the
evidence
contained
in
the
transcript
and
the
two
written
statements
of
mr.
frazee
is
what
the
board
had
in
front
of
it
when
it
passed
on
mr.
frazee's
beliefs.
and
certainly
the
board
of
review
didn't
have
any
problem
identifying
the
religious
basis
of
mr.
frazee's
beliefs.
it
termed
them
"religious
convictions".
the
sole
ground
for
denial,
as
i
mentioned,
was
that
mr.
frazee
did
not
show
that
he
was
exercising
a
belief
of
an
established
religious
organization.
mr.
david
a.
french
thank
you.
mr.
david
a.
french
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
scalia...
excuse
me...
i'd
like
to
just
respond
a
little
more
fully
to
your
question
about
what
the
issue
in
this
case
is.
i'm
not
so
sure
that
the
department
here
has
conceded
for
the
purpose
of
this
oral
argument
that
the
position
of
the
illinois
appellate
court
was
wrong.
in
their
motion
to
dismiss
and...
dismiss
or
affirm,
the
department
took
the
position
on
the
question
presented
as
follows:
whether
a
state
agency
violates
the
free
exercise
clause
of
the
first
amendment
by
denying
an...
an
individual
unemployment
benefits
due
to
his
refusal
to
work
on
a
sunday
when
that
refusal
is
not
based
upon
any
specific
religious
or
church
tenet,
but
rather
upon
his
allegation
of
a
personal
feeling
that
as
a
christian
it
was
wrong
for
him
to
work
on
sundays.
now,
the
first
time
that
the...
the
department
had
changed
the
focus
of
its
argument
at
all
in
this
case
was
after
we
submitted
our
brief
on
the
merits.
but
i'm
not
so
sure
even
in
their
brief
on
the
merits
that
they've
taken
the
position
that
the...
that
they've
conceded
that
the
test
adopted
by
the
illinois
appellate
court
is
wrong.
on
page
20
of
their
brief
they
say,
"congress
cannot
know
and
the
courts
cannot
measure
a
statute's
impact
on
religion
unless
the
salient
points
of
the
religion
are
objectively
measurable.
"
"the
need
to
identify
some
tangible
evidence
of
a
religion
and
its
beliefs
leads
both
courts
and
legislative
bodies
into
invoking
"dogma
and
tenets"
as
a
shorthand
way
to
measure
the
breadth
and
scope
of
religious
beliefs.
"
i'd
like
to
know
myself
from
the
department
whether
they
are
defending,
in
fact,
the
test
adopted
by
the
illinois
and
if
so,
what
the...
what
the
basis
of
that
is
because
i
don't
think
it's
contained
in
their
brief.
mr.
david
a.
french
that's
correct.
the
only
position
that
we're
taking
in
this
court
is
that
that
factor
by
itself
is
not
a
necessary--
mr.
david
a.
french
--condition,
but
it
may
be,
in
fact,
a
relevant
factor
in
determining
whether
a
belief
is
religious
under
the
free
exercise
clause.
mr.
david
a.
french
well,
i
think
that
that
would
certainly--
mr.
david
a.
french
--be
different
from...
there
would
certainly
be
differences
from...
in
that,
in
the
example
that
you've
posed,
from
our
case
first...
firstly.
but,
secondly,
i
would
note
that
the
court...
this
court
itself
in
sherbert
indicated
that
the
denial
in
that
case...
or
that
there
was
no
indication
that
by
granting
unemployment
benefits,
the
claimant
would
be
made
an
unproductive
member
of
society.
and
i
would
submit
that
that's
certainly
an
appropriate
factor
in
determining
whether
there
are
in
fact
limits
here.
and
that
would...
that
would
come
in,
however,
not
in
defining
whether
the
belief
is
religious
under
the
first
amendment,
but
rather
in
the
government
interest
in
denying
the
benefit
in
this
particular
case.
and
they
have...
they
have
not--
mr.
david
a.
french
--that's
correct.
but
the
state
in
this
case
has
not
advanced
such...
such
an
argument
as
the
justification
for
denying
the
benefits
here
to
mr.
frazee.
mr.
david
a.
french
that's
correct,
but
i
would...
would
submit
that
the
grounds
offered
by
the
department
in
this
case
are
not
sufficient
to
sustain
either
the
determination
of
the
board
of
review
or
the
illinois
appellate
court.
i
think
in
either
instance,
the...
the
decision
of
that
court,
based
on
the
findings
that
the
agency
itself
made
and
the
court
made,
necessarily
must
be
overturned
as...
as
a
matter
of
construction
under
the
free
exercise
clause.
what
beliefs
are
protected
under
that...
under
that
clause
and
what
beliefs
are
not?
that's
a
constitutional
question.
mr.
david
a.
french
that's
correct.
now,
just
getting
back
briefly
to
what
transpired
in
this
case,
as
i
mentioned,
the
board
of
review
did,
in
fact,
pass
on
a
broad
range
of
evidence
that
was
before
it,
not
just
the
transcript
that
was
presented
by
mr.
frazee.
they
had
the
two
statements
and
on
the
basis
of
that
testimony,
determined
that
his
belief
was
not
protected
because
he
was
not
exercising
a
belief
or
tenet
of
a...
of
a
church
or
denomination.
that
was
the
sole
ground
given
for
the
decision.
when
mr.
frazee...
when
that
decision
was
given,
he
filed
a
complaint
then
for
administrative
review
in
the
illinois
circuit
court
and
that
court
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
board
of
review.
mr.
frazee
then
appealed
to
the
illinois
appellate
court
and
once
again,
that
court
had
no
problem
determining
either
the
sincerity
of
mr.
frazee's
belief
or
the
religious
nature
of
that
belief.
first
of
all,
the
court
specifically
stated:
"we
do
not
question
the
sincerity
of
plaintiff.
"
secondly,
the
court
also
discussed
in
detail
the
historic
christian
practice
against
sunday
labor.
so,
there's
no
question
they
were
understanding
that
this
was
a...
a
belief
based
on
religious
conviction.
and,
in
fact,
they
termed
mr.
frazee's
belief
a
personal
professed
religious
belief.
the
sole
ground
for
the
rejection
of
mr.
frazee's
claim
that
the
illinois
appellate
court
gave
was
that
that
court
believed
that
the
constitution
extended
protection
to
individuals
only,
number
one,
when
they're
a
member
of
an
established
religious
organization
and,
number
two,
when
they're
exercising
a
tenet
of
that
organization.
that
was
the
sole
ground
given
by
that
court.
now,
it
must
be
emphasized
that
the
illinois
court's
understanding
of
the
scope
of
the
free
exercise
clause
is
not
isolated.
recently
four
state
courts
in
vermont,
new
jersey,
arkansas
and
indiana
have
rejected
free
exercise
clause
claims
on
very
similar
grounds
to
that
advanced
by
the
illinois
appellate
court.
but
that
court's
understanding
of
the
scope
of
the
free
exercise
clause
is
inconsistent
with
important
principles
of
the
first
amendment.
firstly,
on
its
face,
the
test
grants
an
unconstitutional
preference
to
established
religious
organizations
and
disadvantages
religious
dissenters
and
adherence
of
emerging
new
sects.
the
court's
test
by
its
own
terms
makes
protection
for
individual
belief
dependent
on
the
acceptance
of
that
belief
by
others.
that's
precisely
what
this
court
said
in
thomas
the
free
exercise
clause
did
not
require.
in
addition,
that...
the
test
would
operate
to
create
a
de
facto
preference
to
certain
religions
that
are
highly
organized
in
credo.
for
instance,
a
buddhist
or
a
hindu
would
not
qualify
for
protection
under
this
test
no
matter
what
their
beliefs
they
advance
because
neither
buddhism
nor
hinduism,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
maintain
a
uniform
body
or
practices
of
beliefs...
a
uniform
body
of
practices
or
beliefs.
so,
none
of
those
claim...
adherence
to
those
religions
would
qualify
for
protection
under
this
test.
in
addition,
the
test
requires
the
court
to
scrutinize
both
the
individual
religious
belief
and
compare
it
to
the
tenets
of
an
established
religious
organization,
and
that
would
involve
courts
in
questions
of
religious
doctrine
which
is
what
the...
what
the
first
amendment
also
does
not
permit.
the
test
by
its
own
terms
requires
courts
to
determine
who
members
of
established
religious
sects
are
and
also
what
is
the
relevant
established
religious
organization.
both
of
those
questions
often
involve
issues
of
religious
doctrine
and
would
present
the
problem
of
excessive...
courts'
excessive
entanglement
in
religion.
it
appears
that
the
illinois
appellate
court
believed
that
sherbert,
thomas
and
hobble
required
that
an
individual
be
a
member
of
an
established
sect
in
order
to
obtain
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
but
that
goes
far
beyond
what
this
court's
holdings
in...
in
those
cases
and
other
cases
have
required
for
a
belief
to
qualify
for
protection
under
the
first
amendment.
instead
of
requiring
an
individual
to
be
a
member
of
such
a
sect,
what
this
court
has
said
in
those
cases
is
the
only
thing
is
required
that
the
individual
have
an
honest
conviction
that
the
work
is
forbidden
by
his
religion.
so,
in
short,
we
have
two
requirements:
first,
that
the
belief
is
sincerely
held
by
the
individual
and,
secondly,
that
the
belief
must
be
rooted
in
religion
as
opposed
to
purely
philosophical
or
secular
concerns.
mr.
david
a.
french
well,
i
think
it
depends,
justice
kennedy,
on
what
you
mean
by
probe.
they
certainly
could
ascertain
what...
could
have
ascertained
properly
what
the
basis
of
those
beliefs
are
and
what
the
beliefs
themselves
were.
i
think
there's...
there's
no
problem
with
the
court
inquiring
in
that
regard.
mr.
david
a.
french
that's
correct.
mr.
david
a.
french
that's
correct
because
i
think
there's
a...
you
can
distinguish
for...
for
the
purposes
of
the
free
exercise
clause
sincerity,
number
one,
and
secondly,
the
religious
nature
of
a
person's
belief.
i
think
they
are--
mr.
david
a.
french
--i
think
it's
enough
in
this
case,
yes.
mr.
david
a.
french
well,
they
could
have...
if
they
wanted
to
find
out
where
he
got
the
belief,
for
instance,
to
determine
whether
it's...
really
was
an
honest
religious
belief.
i
guess
if
they
made
the
initial
determination
that
he
was
sincere
and
then
in
this
case
he
said
i'm
a
christian
and
am
against
sunday
labor,
and
they
believed
that
he
was
sincere
in
that
assertion,
i
think
that
would
be
sufficient
on
this
record
for...
for--
mr.
david
a.
french
--well,
i
don't
think
that
a
court
or
an
agency
would
be
precluded
by
the
first
amendment
to
go...
from
going
further.
but,
on
the
other
hand,
i
don't
think
there
would
be
any...
any
need
to.
i...
the
only
point
in
going
further...
there
are
only
two
relevant
questions:
first,
the
sincerity
of
the
individual
and,
secondly,
whether
the
belief
itself
is
religious.
if
they
asked
just
two
or
three
questions
and
they...
from
those
questions,
they
can
ascertain
that
the
belief
is...
is
religious
and
the
individual
sincere,
i
don't
think
they
need
to
go
further.
mr.
david
a.
french
well,
i
don't
think
that
would--
mr.
david
a.
french
--be
sufficient.
i
mean,
admittedly
we
have
here
a
record
just
based
on
the
testimony.
i
mean,
there
is
more
than...
more
than
that
in...
on
this
record,
but
if
you
have
just
a
record
where
someone
says
i'm
against
sunday
work,
i
wouldn't
say
that
that's
sufficient
in
and
of
itself
to
determine
whether
the
belief
was
based
on--
mr.
david
a.
french
--well,
it
would
depend
on
how
he
viewed
the
bible
i
would
suppose.
mr.
david
a.
french
i
think
that's
a
close
question.
if
the
court
were
to
adopt
a
functional
test
of
religion
in
short,
like
in
the
seeger
case,
it
probably
would
be
enough
that...
if
the
belief
was
important
enough
to
an
individual
that
it
occupied
a
place
of
central
importance
in
his
or
her
life--
mr.
david
a.
french
--pardon?
mr.
david
a.
french
well,
that
i
think
would
just
depend
on
how
religion
is
defined.
mr.
david
a.
french
yes,
we
do.
we
know,
first
of
all,
that
he's
relying
on
the
fact
that
he
is
a
christian,
number
one.
and,
number
two,
we
know
that
he's
basing
it
on
his
belief
and
his
own
personal
reading
of
the
bible
in
relying
on
specific
passages
in
the
decalogue
and
in
christ's
example
in
the
new
testament.
plus,
what
we
have
as...
as
corroborative
evidence
is
the
long
history
of
christian
belief
and
practice
which
the
illinois
appellate
court
itself
took
note
of.
i
think
all
those
factors
are
more
than
sufficient
to
meet
what
i
would
consider
a
low
threshold
that's...
that's
required.
mr.
david
a.
french
no,
i'm
not
suggesting--
mr.
david
a.
french
--excuse
me,
justice--
mr.
david
a.
french
--well,
justice
marshall,
i
would
say
that--
mr.
david
a.
french
--well,
that's
a
close
case.
i
would
say
that
probably
not
unless
you
determined
that--
mr.
david
a.
french
--he
discusses...
he
discusses
further
and
talks
about
what
he
means.
mr.
david
a.
french
well,
i
don't
think
from
that--
mr.
david
a.
french
--on
that
statement
alone,
i
wouldn't
say
that
you
would
be
able
to
determine
either
the
place
of
the...
of
the
belief
in
the
individual's
life
or
where
it
was
derived
from.
mr.
david
a.
french
i...
i'm
religious
and
don't
believe
in
work
on
sunday
and
i'm
a
christian?
mr.
david
a.
french
yes.
in
this--
mr.
david
a.
french
--in
this
case,
yes,
it
would
be.
i'm
not
saying
that's--
mr.
david
a.
french
--a
test
across
the
board.
if
he
says--
mr.
david
a.
french
--if
he
said
i'm
a
christian
and
i
want
to--
mr.
david
a.
french
--no,
not...
not...
well,
it
would
depend.
mr.
david
a.
french
it
would
depend
on...
on
the
facts,
justice
marshall.
i
would
suggest
if
he
said
i'm
a
christian
and
therefore
i
believe
in
playing
golf
on
wednesday,
i
would
say
that
by
itself
would
not
be
sufficient
because
there's
no...
there's
no
corroboration
that
has
ever
been
a
religious
belief
that
has
been
held
by
anyone
in
the
history
of
christianity.
but
we
have
much
more
than
that
here.
mr.
david
a.
french
that's
correct.
mr.
david
a.
french
that's...
that
would
be
clearly
analogous
to...
to
the
case
we
have
before
us.
but
if
someone
says
i'm
a
wiccan,
for
instance,
one
of
the
cases
cited
by
the...
by
the
department
here
and...
and
therefore
i
don't...
i
have
to
twiddle
my
thumbs,
well,
then
i
would
suggest
that
we
would
need
more.
but
what
we
have
here
is
a
belief
that
has
been
recognized
by
this
court
in
the
mcgowan
case
in
1961
as
a...
as
a
religious
belief.
it's
not...
it's
not
something
that
anyone
common...
who
has
common
knowledge
on
religion
would
question
as
a
religious
belief
unless...
unless
the
sincerity
of
the
claimant
is
being
questioned.
then
you
would
have
an
issue,
but
we
don't
have
that
case.
mr.
david
a.
french
well--
mr.
david
a.
french
--i
would
say
not
on
these
facts...
or
not
on...
on
that
statement
alone.
he
would
have
to
show
more
to
show
that...
that--
mr.
david
a.
french
--all
right.
it...
well,
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
sincere.
i
mean,
as...
if
you
mean
by
sincere
that
he
truly
believes
it
to
be
a
religious
belief--
mr.
david
a.
french
--that's
one
question.
mr.
david
a.
french
well,
i
think
in
that
sense
that
confiates
the...
the
issue
of
what
is
a
religious
belief
with
what
is
sincerity.
and
i...
i
would
say
that
under
the
cases,
although
they're...
they're
related,
i
think
they're
distinct.
but
if
you...
if
you
employ
it
in
the
sense
that...
that
you're
using
it,
i
would
say
that
he
then
would
probably
still
have
to
have
more,
although
maybe
not
a
lot
more.
the
reason
i...
i
say
that
is
that--
mr.
david
a.
french
--well,
i
think
there
are
many...
i
think
that's
correct.
i
wouldn't
disagree
with
that
at
all.
i
think
there
are
many
factors
that
a
court
can...
can
look
at
to
determine
whether
a
belief
is
religious,
and
one
of
the
best...
one
of
the
best
factors
or
one
of
a
number
of
factors
could
be
whether
specific
religious
denominations
have
formalized
that
religious
belief
in
a...
in
a
formal
creed
of
some
sort.
mr.
david
a.
french
that's
correct.
but
here
what
we
have
in
this
case,
the...
the
only
question
that
we
have
is
whether
mr.
frazee's
belief
was
not
so
bizarre
as
to
be
clearly
non-religious
in
motivation.
and
i
would
submit
on
this
record
he
clearly...
his
belief
clearly
satisfies
that
standard.
and
i
think
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
a.
french
yes.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
briefly,
first
of
all,
the
department's
statement
that
the
illinois
appellate
court
couldn't
identify
mr.
frazee's
beliefs
as
religious
is
just
flatly
erroneous.
on
page
790
of
512
northeastern
reporter,
the...
the
court
specifically
stated
we
have
presented
for
determination
in
this
appeal
the
question
of
whether
the
plaintiff's
personal,
professed
religious
belief
that
he
could
not
work
on
sundays
constituted
good
cause
for
his
refusal
of
work.
all
they
were
doing
was
accepting
the
finding
that
began
in
the
administrative
agency,
the
very
first
finding
that
was
made
by
the
claims
adjudicator
that
said
mr.
frazee
would
not
accept
work
because
of
his
religious
convictions.
this
court
doesn't
need
to
make
an
independent
review
of
the
record
to
determine--
mr.
david
a.
french
--yes,
in
fact,
they
did.
in
their...
in
their
brief,
they
cited
the
decision
out
of
arkansas
that...
that
accorded
in--
mr.
david
a.
french
--that's
correct.
and
i
would
just
say
that
what...
the
question
of
what
is
a
religious
belief
is
a
hard
question.
but
the
court
does
not
have
to
define
what
is
a
religious
belief
in
this
case
on
this
record.
we're
not
presented
with
an
issue
on
the
periphery.
on
this
record
we
clearly
have
a
religious
belief.
the
illinois
appellate
court
made
that
determination.
so
did
the
agency.
therefore,
all
the
court
has
to
determine
is
whether
under
the
free
exercise
clause,
the...
the...
an
individual
has
to
have
a
belief
of
an
established
religious
organization
that's
held
as
a
tenet
by
that
organization.
and
i
would
submit
clearly
under
the
free
exercise
clause,
that's
not
required
and
clearly
the
decision
of
the
illinois
appellate
court
should
be
reversed
and
the
case
remanded
to
the
illinois
circuit
court
for
a
determination
of
the
amount
of
benefits
owing
to
mr.
frazee
in
this
case.
thank
you.
