unknown
speaker
did
he
very
many?
unknown
speaker
mr.
french,
i'm
afraid
we're
going
to
have
a
very
disappointing
argument
here
today.
as
i
read
the
briefs,
i'm
not
sure
your
opponent
wants
to
argue
about
the
question
as
you
so
well
expressed
it.
you
did,
indeed,
express
the
question
that
was
presented
in
the
petition
for
cert
at
the
outset
of
your
brief,
whether
you
have
to
be
a
member
of
an
organized
religion
in
order
to
claim
the
benefit
of
these
cases.
but
as
i
understand
the
position
being...
being
taken
here
by...
by
the
appellees,
they
concede
that
point.
and
all
they
want
to
argue
about
is
whether...
whether,
indeed,
your
client
adequately
established
the
sincerity
of
his
religious
conviction
as
opposed
to
whether
it
was
part
of
an
organized
religion
or
not.
unknown
speaker
i
would
hate
to
think
we
took
this
case
just...
just
to
decide
whether...
whether
your
client
proved
with
adequate...
with
adequate
force
the
sincerity
of
his
conviction.
that's
really
not
the
kind
of--
unknown
speaker
--we
usually
take
up
here,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
french,
it...
it
is
true
that
the
board
of
review
ended
up
its
opinion
saying,
"however,
other
than
his
own
self-serving
testimony,
the
claimant
has
presented
no
corroborative
evidence
to
establish
that
working
on
a
sunday
was
unsuitable
for
him.
"
unknown
speaker
we'll
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock,
mr.
french.
unknown
speaker
mr.
french,
you
may
resume
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
about
your
position.
you
would
not
have
any
problem
with
a
state
saying
one
of
the
indicia
of
sincerity
is
that
you
belong
to
a
religious
group
which,
as
a
whole,
supports
this
position
dogmatically.
unknown
speaker
necessary.
unknown
speaker
mr.
french,
how
far
does
your
theory
take
you?
suppose
someone
had
a
sincere
religious
belief
that
he
shouldn't
work
at
all,
monday
through
friday.
unknown
speaker
are
there
any
limits?
unknown
speaker
the
extent
to
which
the
state
has
a
compelling
interest?
unknown
speaker
you...
suppose
the
department
gets
up
and
say,
no,
we
don't
defend
the
decision
below.
we
just
want
to
support
it
on
another
ground.
wouldn't
we...
we
wouldn't
necessarily
have
to
agree
with...
with
either
one
of
you
that
the
court
below
erred.
we
would
still
have
to
decide
that
it
did.
unknown
speaker
but
the...
but
the
stipulation
or
agreement
of
the
parties
doesn't
conclude
this
court
on
a
question
at
law.
unknown
speaker
on...
on
this
record,
once
it
was
established
that
he
was
sincere,
did
the
state...
could
the
state
legitimately
have
probed
further
into
the
nature
of
the
religious
beliefs?
or
should
it...
must
it
as
a
matter
of
law
simply
have
accepted
his
excuse
as
valid
based
on
the
testimony
that's
in
this
record?
unknown
speaker
they
could
have
supplemented
and
amplified
the
record
in
that
regard?
unknown
speaker
even...
even
once
it
was
established
or
conceded
that
he
was
sincere?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
said...
he
said
it's
because
i'm
a
christian.
isn't
that
enough?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
purpose
would
be
served
by
further
probing?
unknown
speaker
i
know
it's
sufficient.
would
there
be
any
further
justification
under
your
view
for
inquiry?
unknown
speaker
but
what
if
he
said
he
was
not
a
christian.
he
just
said
i
don't
believe
in
sunday
work.
i
think
it's
wrong.
i've
always
felt
that
way
since
i
was
a
child.
unknown
speaker
xxx.
unknown
speaker
what
if
you
just
added
to
that
that
when
he
was
a
child
his...
his
guardian
or
one
of
his
parents
read
him
a
passage
from
the
bible
that
said
something
about
not
working
on
the
seventh
day
or
something
like
that.
unknown
speaker
he...
that's
the
only
thing.
that's
the
only...
that's
the
only
tenet
he
has,
but
he
believes
it
very
deeply
that
working
on
sunday
is
wrong.
he
has
always
felt
that
way
throughout
his
life.
never
done
any
work
on
sunday
just
because
he
thinks
that
is
something
of
some
fundamental
importance.
would
that
be--
unknown
speaker
--no,
it
was
important
enough
so
he
never
worked
on
sunday.
that's--
unknown
speaker
--it
was
important
enough
so
that
he
never
worked
on
sunday.
unknown
speaker
we
don't
know
anything
really
more
about
this...
this
person's
belief
than
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
suggesting
that
it
was
a
tenet
of
his
religion
not
to
work
on
sunday.
unknown
speaker
xxx.
well,
not
in
the
sense
that
the
illinois
appellate
court
used
the
word
"tenet".
the
illinois
appellate
court
was
using
the...
employed
the
term
"tenet"
in
a
formal
sense,
something
formally
adopted
by
a
religious
organization.
in
that
sense,
clearly
it
wasn't
a
tenet.
and
a
tenet,
if
you
use
the...
define
the
word
"tenet"
in
just
an
informal
sense
as...
as
a
belief
that
a
person
possesses,
then
yes,
it
was
a
tenet
of...
of
his
religious
belief.
and
i
think
that
is
sufficient
on
this
record
what
we
have
before
the
court
to...
to
determine
that
his
belief
was
in
fact
religious.
do
you
have
to
have
the
word
"christian"
there?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
to
have
"christian"?
unknown
speaker
a
man
says
i'm
a
religious
man,
and
i
don't
believe
in
working
on
sunday.
and
that's
the
only...
that's
all
i
give
you.
is
that
enough?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--no,
no.
in
mine,
that's
all
he
says.
unknown
speaker
now--
unknown
speaker
--well,
the
next
one
is
he
says
that
and
he
says
also
i'm
a
christian
and
nothing
else.
is
that
enough?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
so
that
the
word
"christian"
is
the
key
word.
unknown
speaker
well,
that--
unknown
speaker
--that
doesn't
give
you--
unknown
speaker
--that
doesn't
give
you
any
problem
with
the
other
religions,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
does
to
some
people.
unknown
speaker
conversely,
if
he
had
said,
i'm
a
jew
and
i
don't
believe
in
working
on
saturday,
that
would
be
sufficient--
unknown
speaker
--would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
because
it's
a...
it's
a
fairly
standard
religious
belief
for
many
people.
what...
what
if
he...
what
if
he
did
say,
though,
you
know,
god
has
appeared
to
me
and
told
me
to
play
golf
on
wednesdays
and
i
can't
take
any
job
that
won't
let
me
play
golf
on
wednesdays.
unknown
speaker
and
i'm
persuaded
that
this
fellow
is
very
sincere
about
it.
does
the
state
have
to
set
up
its
system
so
it
would
allow
him
to
play
golf
on
wednesdays?
unknown
speaker
he
sincerely
believes
it.
put
in
whatever
additional
information
you
need
to
establish
that
he
is
sincere
about
that.
unknown
speaker
uh-hum.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
now,
well,
listen.
what
i'm
getting
at
is...
you
know,
i
agree
with
you
totally.
indeed,
i
think
the
other
side
may
agree
with
you
totally
that...
that
you
can't
require
that
the
person
be
a
member
of
an
organized
religion.
but
i
wonder
whether
the
kind
of...
the
kind
of
excuses
that
you
allow
the
person
to
put
forward
do
not
have
to
be
excuses
that
are
within
the
range
of
things
that
not
any
particular
organized
religion,
but
at
least
some
organized
religion
have...
have
used
in
the
past.
unknown
speaker
so,
you
say
even
if
it
doesn't
go
to
sincerity,
it
can
go
to
whether
it's
a
religious
belief--
unknown
speaker
--very
well,
mr.
french.
mr.
ruiz?
unknown
speaker
are
you
defending
the
opinion
below
or
just
the
judgment?
unknown
speaker
well,
didn't
it
say
that...
didn't
it
say
that
this
was
a
religious
belief?
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
the
court.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
it
decided
on
the
basis
that
this
was
a
religious
belief,
but
that
it
wasn't
shown
to
be
a
part
of
any
ritual
of
a
church?
unknown
speaker
well,
if...
if
we
think
the
decision
turned
on...
on
the
fact
that
it
wasn't
shown
that
this
was
part...
was
a
formal
part
of
some
church
dogma,
if
we
think
the...
the
case
turned
on
that
you,
would
agree
we
should
reverse
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
you
position
about
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
that.
unknown
speaker
i
know
that.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--well,
do
you
think
it's
a...
do
you
think
it's
the
rule
in
cases
like
this
that
the
asserted
religious
belief
be
shown
to
be
a
formal
dogma
of
a
particular
church?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that
what
the
court
below
held?
i'm
looking
at
its
opinion
and
it
says,
"the
injunction
against
sunday
labor
must
be
found
in
a
tenet
or
a
dogma
of
an
establish
religious
sect.
"
"the
plaintiff
in
this
case
does
not
profess
to
be
a
member
of
any
such
sect.
"
"affirmed.
"
i
mean,
it...
it
looks
pretty
clear,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
suppose
that's
not
our
reading
of
the
case.
then
do
we
reverse?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
we...
we
affirm
a
decision
which
is
based
on
a
patently
erroneous
statement
of
constitutional
law.
unknown
speaker
suppose...
suppose...
suppose
we
conclude
that
the
decision
is
based
on
the
sentence
that
justice
o'connor
read.
and
suppose
further
we
conclude
it's
wrong.
then
we
must
reverse.
unknown
speaker
well,
i'd
like
to
hear
why.
unknown
speaker
i'd
like
to
hear
why.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
want
us
to
redetermine
the
facts.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
should
we
do
that?
we
normally
don't.
we
took
it
to
decide
an
issue
of
law,
the
issue
presented
in
the
cert
petition.
and
you
apparently
don't
even
want
to
talk
about
that
issue.
unknown
speaker
xxx
whether
you
think
that
that
statement
that
justice
o'connor
read
is
a
correct
statement
of
constitutional
law.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that's
a
correct
statement
of
the
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
you--
unknown
speaker
--so,
you
do
not
defend
that...
that
statement
in
the
opinion.
unknown
speaker
you
just
say...
you
just
say
that
wasn't
the
basis
for...
for
the
decision,
or
even
if
it
was,
we
can
decide
it
another
way.
unknown
speaker
uh-hum.
the
court
below
also
said,
in
addition
to
what
justice
o'connor
quoted,
"we
do
not
question
the
sincerity
of
the
plaintiff.
"
you
want
us
to
decide
this
case
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
sincerity
was
not
demonstrated
when...
when
the
court
below
was
satisfied
about
sincerity?
unknown
speaker
and
you
want
us
to
do
that
for
the
first
time
even
though
the
state
court
didn't
even
do
it.
unknown
speaker
no.
the
state
court
said
we
don't
question
the
sincerity
of
the
plaintiff.
unknown
speaker
so,
your...
your
position
really
is
although
his
belief
was
sincere,
it
was
not
religiously
based?
unknown
speaker
because?
and
the
reason
being?
unknown
speaker
what
has
constitutional
analysis
got
to
do
with
right
or
wrong,
yes
or
no?
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
it.
unknown
speaker
are
you...
are
you
saying
there
was
a
failure
of
proof?
unknown
speaker
even
though
he's
sincere,
he's
not
so.
unknown
speaker
what
could
he
show?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
if
anything.
unknown
speaker
i
warn
you
in
advance
my
next
question
would
be
did
you
show
anything
to
the
contrary.
so,
go
right
ahead.
unknown
speaker
could
you
have
asked
him
that
question?
unknown
speaker
could
you
have
asked
him
those
questions
on
cross?
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
you
could.
unknown
speaker
and
you
didn't.
unknown
speaker
and
you
didn't.
unknown
speaker
well,
could
that
person
who
asked
ask
these
other
questions?
well,
he
did--
unknown
speaker
--he
did
say...
in
answer
to
one
of
those
questions
what's
the
basis,
he
said
my
personal
christian
faith
in
the
lord.
unknown
speaker
and
isn't
that
sufficient?
unknown
speaker
what
more
does
one
need
than
faith
in
the
lord
and
being
a
christian
and
therefore
thinking
sunday
work
is
wrong?
and
you
don't
question
the
sincerity
of
that
either.
unknown
speaker
based
on
a
faith
in
the
lord.
unknown
speaker
let
him
answer
the
question.
i'm
sorry.
unknown
speaker
mr.
ruiz,
was
this
the
argument
that
was
made
by
the
state
to
the
illinois
appellate
court,
the
argument
you're
making
to
us
today?
or
did
the
state
simply
argue
that
the
board's
decision
should
be
affirmed?
unknown
speaker
so,
we're
hearing
this
entirely
for
the
first
time.
it's
something
that
wasn't
presented
below.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
i'm
still
not
sure
what
you're...
what
you're
asking
us
to
hold,
mr.
ruiz.
if
i
understand
what
you're
saying,
a
person
can
say
god
does
not
want...
i...
i
am
a
religious
person.
god
does
not
want
me
to
work
on
sunday.
and
i
can...
i
can
say,
yes,
you
think
that,
and
i'm
sure
you're
sincere.
and
yet,
i'm
still
not
sure
that
that's
a
religious
belief.
right?
is
that
what
you're
asking
us
to...
to
believe?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i
don't
question
his
sincerity.
i
acknowledge.
yes,
i
understand
that
you
believe
that
god
does
not
want
you
to
work
on
sunday.
that's
what
this
court
means
when
it
says
it
doesn't
question
his
sincerity.
he
says
god
does
not
want
me
to
work
on
sunday.
and
the
court
says,
yes,
i
believe
you
believe
that,
but
that's
not
a
religious
belief.
well,
what
more...
what
more
do
you
possibly
have
to
prove
to
show
it's
a
religious
belief
except
that
you
think
that
god
commands
it
and
you
sincerely
believe
that?
once
you've
shown
those
two
things,
it
seems
to
me
you've
established
your
religious
belief,
haven't
you?
unknown
speaker
but
under
your
theory...
and
i'm
still
not
quite
sure
how
to
articulate
it,
but
under
your
theory,
was
the
state
required
to
deny
the
employment
exemption?
unknown
speaker
based
on
this
record,
was
the
state
required
to
deny
the
application
for
benefits?
unknown
speaker
on
the
basis
of
what's...
all
that's
in
this
record.
if
the
hearing
officer
had
granted
the
exemption,
could
you
have
taken
him
to
your
state
court
and
had
a
reversal
as
a
matter
of
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
all
that
sounds
very
good
to
me,
but...
but
i
think
what
you're
questioning
with
that
is
his
sincerity.
i
think
what
you're
saying
is
this
fellow...
he
didn't
really
even
belong
to
an
organized
religion.
he
didn't
show
he
ever
goes
to
church,
but
he
comes
in
here
and
says
i've
always
felt
it's
wrong
to
go...
you
know,
to
work
on
sunday
because
i'm
a
christian.
if
you
want
to
question
his
sincerity,
that's
fine.
but
here
you
have
a
court
that
says,
oh,
no,
i
believe
he's
sincere
that
he
really
believes
that
god
doesn't
want
him
to
work
on
sunday,
but
nonetheless
that's
not
a
religious
belief.
i
think
once
you
admit
he
sincerely
believes
that
god
does
not
want
him
to
work
on
sunday,
you
have
a
religious
belief.
i
don't
know
what...
what
more
you
have
to
prove.
unknown
speaker
and...
and
that
the
belief
is...
is...
is
thought
by
the
individual
holding
it
to
be
imposed
by
god,
that
does
not
necessarily
make
it
religious.
unknown
speaker
i
think
they
go
to
sincerity.
i'm
sorry.
i
guess
i
just
cannot
understand
you.
i
think...
it
seems
to
me
you're
questioning
whether
he's
sincere.
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
put
it
another
way.
what
do
you
mean
other
than
sincere?
other
than
sincere.
unknown
speaker
what
are
you
arguing
other
than
that
he
was
not
sincere?
unknown
speaker
xxx
not
important.
are
you
saying
sincerity
is
not
important?
unknown
speaker
xxx
first
raised
the
sincerity
point?
unknown
speaker
when
was
it
first
raised?
unknown
speaker
that
was
when
it
was
first
raised.
and
it
was
raised
continually.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and...
and
every
place
you
lost.
unknown
speaker
the
sincerity
point.
unknown
speaker
you
lost
in
every
step,
didn't
you?
and
now
you
want
to
get
it
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
did
the
court
below
say
that
we
don't
doubt
his
sincerity?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
didn't
raise
it.
unknown
speaker
they
just
reached
out
in
the
air
and
grabbed
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
this
court
rarely
does
something
like
that
when
the
lower
courts
have
not
tackled
it.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
your
position
you
would
have
confessed
error
on
the
point
of
law
and
asked
that
the
case
be
remanded
to
the
appellate
court
so
that
you
could
make
this
argument
where
it
belongs,
not
here.
i...
i
don't
understand
why
you're
making
this
argument
to
us,
frankly.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
ruiz.
mr.
french,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
did
the...
did
the
board
or
agency...
did
they
argue
in
the
appellate
court
to
the
effect
that
it...
that
his
belief
must
be...
represent
a
dogma
of
a
particular
church?
unknown
speaker
which
now...
which
they
now
say
is
an
erroneous
statement
of
constitutional
law.
