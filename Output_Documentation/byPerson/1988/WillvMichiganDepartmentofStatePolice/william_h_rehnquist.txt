87-1207,
ray
will
v.
michigan
department
of
state
police.
mr.
burnham,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice

h.
rehnquist
mr.
burnham,
one
thing
that
seems
strange
to
me
about
this
case
is,
if
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
had
wanted
to
award
damages
on
this
cause
of
action,
it
surely
could
have
done
so
just
under
some
general
state
law
theory.
was
the
intimation
from
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
opinion
that,
had
the
petitioner
chosen
to
sue
just
under
state
law
rather
than
under
1983
the
result
might
have
been
different?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
holding
as
to
the
state
constitution
was
in
this
very
case
but
it
was
not
applied
to
him.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
were
they
brought
under
section
1983
in
the
louisiana
courts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
burnham.
mr.
weller,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
agree
with
you
on
that
second
point?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
weller.
mr.
burnham,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
burnham.
your
time
has
expired.
the
case
is
submitted.
