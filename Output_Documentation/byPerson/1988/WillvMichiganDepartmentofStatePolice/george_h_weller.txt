mr.
george
h.
weller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
takes
the
position,
first,
congress
has
the
power
under
section
5
of
the
14th
amendment
to
include
the
states
within
section
1,
that
is
to
include
the
states
within
the
meaning
of
person,
but
it
did
not
do
so.
and
our
second
position
is
since
this
action
for
damages
was
in
the
michigan
court
of
claims,
against
the
office
of
the
director
of
the
state
police,
not
the
director
of
the
state
police
personally,
and
the
only
defendant
in
the
michigan
court
of
claims
is
the
state
of
michigan
itself.
there
is
only
one
defendant
in
this
case,
and
that's
the
state
of
michigan.
and
the
caption
merely
sets
forth
in
two
different
ways
a
cause
of
action
against
the
state
of
michigan.
mr.
george
h.
weller
yes,
they
did,
you
honor.
they
found...
when
they
described
the
state
not
being
a
person
they
then
proceeded
to
describe
an
action
against
the
state
official
who
was
being
sued
in
this
case
and
used
the
same
logic
and
the
same
premise
and
found
that
he
was
not
a
person
as
well.
now,
on
our
first
position,
if
congress
intended
to
use
its
new
power
under
the
14th
amendment
that
had
been
enacted
three
years
before,
and
to
do
away
with
the
traditional
immunity
of
the
states
from
an
action
for
damages,
in
their
own
state
courts,
and
do
this
on
a
federal
cause
of
action,
congress
would
have
expressly
said
so
in
section
1,
or
would
have
made
a
clear
statement
that
the
states
were
included
within
the
meaning
of
the
word
"person".
and
the
reasons
for
this
are,
number
one,
as
this
court
has
pointed
out,
in
common
usage,
"person"
does
not
include
a
sovereign
state
and
statutes
using
the
word
"person"
are
ordinarily
interpreted
not
to
include
a
sovereign
state.
and
secondly,
there
was
no
presumption
in
1871
that
the
word
"person"
included
the
sovereign
states.
in
other
words,
the
dictionary
act
of
the
previous
congress,
not
the
same
congress,
as
set
forth
by
the
petitioner,
but
the
dictionary
act
of
the
previous
congress
did
not
intend
to
include
the
sates
within
the
meaning
of
the
word
"person".
this
is
illustrated
by
the
commissioners'
action
in
changing
the
wording
and
further
illustrated
by
mr.
durant's
further
analysis
of
what
the
commissioners
had
done.
and
he
made
a
report
on
december
the
10th
in
1873
to
the
congress,
and
he
said,
i
have
retained
only
those
meanings
that
are
found
in
the
statutes
at
large.
and
the
meanings
that
he
retained
that
the
commissioners
utilized
was
to
use
partnerships
and
corporations
as
the
meaning
of
person
in
the
dictionary
act.
mr.
george
h.
weller
in
the
sherman
act
and
other
acts,
as
i
understand
it,
your
honor,
the
word
"person"
of
course
may
include
the
states
under
the
circumstances.
you
have
to
analyze
and
determine
whether
or
not
the
word
"person"
includes
the
states.
there
are
some
cases,
for
example,
in
which
the
states
were
setting
up
pharmaceutical
practices
that
were
competing
with
private
enterprise
in
that.
but
our
basic
premise
here
is
that
the
word
"person"
ordinarily
is
not
used
to
include
the
states,
and
there's
no
indication
that
the
states
were
intended
to
be
included
within
the
meaning
of
the
word
in
this
law.
so
with
no
common
usage,
and
with
no
presumption,
and
with
no
expressed
statement,
the
plain
meaning
of
person
in
the
1871
act,
our
position
is,
did
not
include
the
states.
now,
if
congress
had
intended
to
include
the
states
within
the
meaning
of
the
word,
this
would
have
been
a
radical
change.
and
under
the
law
at
the
time,
a
radical
change
would
require
an
explicit
showing
or
would
require
an
expressed
statement
or
a
clear
statement
that
it
was
the
collective
will
of
the
congress
to
include
the
states
within
this
meaning.
and
to
include
the
states
within
the
meaning
of
the
word
"person",
in
light
of
quern,
would
mean
that
congress
by
its
collective
will
intended
to
subject
the
states
to
actions
for
damages
in
their
own
state
courts
on
a
federal
cause
of
action.
mr.
george
h.
weller
i
don't
understand,
you
honor.
i
have
a
little
trouble
in
getting
the
word
"corporation"?
mr.
george
h.
weller
well,
the
word
"corporations"
normally
includes,
for
example,
municipal
corporations
and
counties
and
that.
that's
understood.
states
occasionally
may
be
included
within
the
word
"corporation",
but
they're
not
normally
used
within
the
meaning
of
the
word
"corporation".
mr.
george
h.
weller
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
don't
recall
that
language
in
the
14th
amendment,
that
corporations
are--
mr.
george
h.
weller
--yes.
mr.
george
h.
weller
well,
we're
speaking
of
the
intention
of
congress
in
1871,
your
honor.
and
in
1871...
again,
our
position
is
that
states
were
not
included,
that
the
intention
of
the
previous
congress
was
to
include
corporations.
but
as
they
used
corporations
it
did
not
include
the
states.
now,
the
court
in...
the
court
in
quern
has
already
held
that
section
1983
was
not
intended
to
abrogate
the
state's
traditional
sovereign
immunity
in
the
federal
courts.
the
court
in
quern
also
pointed
out
that
no
member
of
congress
in
the
legislative
history
of
legislative
debate
made
any
mention
of
financial
consequences
to
the
states,
nor
did
any
member
focus
directly
on
the
question
of
state
liability.
so
that...
since
quern
has
already
has
already
held
there's
no
federal
right
in
the
federal
courts,
there's
the
strongest
implication
in
quern
that
the...
this
court
did
not
intend
to
interpret
person
as
including
the
states.
now,
the
purpose
of
the
1871
act
was,
of
course,
to
enforce
the
14th
amendment.
and
under
the
14th
amendment,
under
section
<five>
[=
5],
it
was
left
to
congress
to
decide
whether
to
enact
legislation
or
what
kind
of
legislation
to
enact.
congress
could
choose
to
act
to
the
fullness
of
its
power,
or
congress
could
choose
to
act
to
some
lesser
degree.
it
didn't
need
to
exercise
all
of
its
power
under
section
5.
and
our
position
is
that
congress
did
not
need,
in
1871,
to
exercise
all
of
its
power
and
include
the
states
within
the
meaning
of
the
word
"person"
in
part
because,
as
the
court
has
already
pointed
out,
the
problem
was
not
with
the
state
laws
on
the
books
or
with
the
state
remedies
that
were
available.
the
problem
was
with
enforcement.
state
laws
were
not
being
equally
enforced,
or
the
state
laws
were
not
being
enforced
at
all,
or
the
state
courts
were
powerless
to
act
or
they
were
in
league
with
those
who
were
depriving
others
of
their
federal
rights.
so
the
perceived
need
in
congress
in
1871
was
for
effective
enforcement
and
open,
fair,
and
objective
courts.
so
the
perceived
need,
the
collective
will
of
the
congress,
was
to
give
immediate
access
to
the
federal
courts
for
actions
for
damages
or
for
suits
for
injunctive
relief.
and
this
need
was
fulfilled
by
using
the
word
"person"
that
included
government
officials,
and
included
local
communities,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
monell.
but
there
is
no
perceived
need
nor
was
there
any
collective
will
to
include
the
states
within
the
1871
civil
rights
act.
for
one
thing,
there
is
no
tradition
in
1871
of
an
action
or
a
suit
against
a
state,
against
its
will.
in
fact,
i've
been
unable
to
find
any
such
case
between
chisholm
v.
georgia
in
1793
and
1871.
what
there
was
in
1871
was
a
strong
tradition
of
the
immunity
of
the
states
from
suits
in
their
own
courts.
that
doesn't
mean
the
1871
act
did
not
provide
relief.
for
example,
actions
for
damages
were
made
available
in
the
federal
courts
against
those
against
whom
such
actions
had
long
been
recognized,
for
example,
state
officials
and
local
officials.
and
as
the
court
said
in
monell,
local
communities.
and
in
response
to
your
question,
sir,
the
prosser
of
his
day
was
a
gentleman
called
hillard.
and
in
hillard
on
torts,
at
page
269
in
1866,
mr.
hillard
points
out
the
ready
availability
of
actions
for
damages
against
public
officials.
mr.
hillard
also
wrote
another
book
on
injunctions.
in
1864
on
page
443
and
444
he
points
out
that
there
was
a
long
tradition
of
suits
for
injunctive
relief
against
public
officers
who
are
acting
illegally
or
unconstitutionally.
and
in
there
he
cites
other
cases
as
well.
so
the
1871
act
provided
relief
against
state
officials--
mr.
george
h.
weller
--yes.
mr.
george
h.
weller
in
his...
that
would
be
in
his
personal
capacity,
your
honor,
against
him
as
a
person.
mr.
george
h.
weller
yes.
mr.
george
h.
weller
well,
that,
that,
that,
that
goes
back
to
the
governor
of
georgia
v.
madrazo
where
the
suit
is
against
the
office
of
the
individual,
not
against
the
individual
as
a
person.
and
so
therefore,
that
kind
of
a
suit
that
you
describe
would
be
against
the
office,
therefore
it
would
be
against
the
state,
not...
and
therefore
it
would
be
barred,
as
opposed
to
there
was
a
separate--
mr.
george
h.
weller
--no,
that's
basically
what
i
found
in
the
treatises
at
the
time.
mr.
george
h.
weller
some
of
them
are
cited
in
our
brief,
and
hillard
i
found
after
we
wrote
our
brief.
so
this
recourse
in
the
1871
act
against
officials
and
local
communities,
but
not
against
the
states,
it
ensured
the
supremacy
of
federal
law
but
at
the
same
time
it
accommodated
the
traditional
immunity
of
the
states
in
what
this
court
in
monell
referred
to
as
coordinate
sovereignty.
in
other
words,
it
made
the
balance
that
ensured
that
federal
law
would
be
supreme,
the
federal
constitution
would
be
supreme.
now,
the
immediate
reason
for
the
1871
act
was
the
violence
that
was
being
directed
towards
blacks
and
towards
sympathetic
whites
who
were
the
backbone
of
the
southern
republican
parties.
but
the
act,
of
course,
applied
to
all
of
the
states,
not
just
the
southern
states.
and
so
we
have
this
question,
the
court
has
yet
to
hold...
this
court
has
yet
to
hold
that
a
state
court
must
entertain
a
claim
under
section
1983.
what
this
court
has
said
is
that
a
state
court
may
not
discriminate
against
a
type
of
federal
action
when
that
same
type
of
action
arising
under
state
law
is
enforced
in
the
state
courts.
so
it's
most
unlikely
that
in
1871
it
was
the
collective
will
of
the
1871
congress,
and
particularly
since
the
senators
were
still
being
elected
by
the
legislatures
not
by
the
people,
it's
most
unlikely
that
it
was
the
collective
will
of
that
congress
to
include
the
states
within
the
meaning
of
the
word
1871
congress
to
abrogate
their
traditional
sovereign
immunity
of
their
states,
only
in
the
state
courts,
and
thus
raise
the
possibility
that
the
states
would
be
subject
to
actions
for
damages
on
a
federal
cause
of
action
in
their
state
courts
when
they
would
not
be
subject
to
the
same
type
of
cause
of
action
under
state
law.
so
our
feeling
is...
our
basic
premise
is
there
is
nothing
in
the
context,
or
in
the
subject
matter,
or
in
the
legislative
history
or
in
the
tenor
of
the
times
to
show
that
it
was
the
collective
will
of
the
congress,
a
republican-dominated
house
and
senate,
to
do
away
with
the
traditional
immunity
of
the
states
and
subject
them
to
damages
in
their
own
state
courts.
mr.
george
h.
weller
well,
that's
what
quern
said,
your
honor,
that
the--
mr.
george
h.
weller
--this,
this
is
a
cause
of
action
alleging
a
violation
of
a
federal
statute.
and--
mr.
george
h.
weller
--and
you
have
jurisdiction
to
interpret
the
meaning
of
the
statute
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
states
were
or
were
not
included.
mr.
george
h.
weller
we
can
be
here
because
the
state
courts
enforce
federal
law
as
well,
your
honor.
mr.
george
h.
weller
you're
in...
we're
in
federal
court
on
an
appeal
from
a
state
court
handling
a
federal
cause
of
action.
mr.
george
h.
weller
i
don't
believe,
your
honor,
that
the
11th
amendment
bars
actions
on
appeal
on
federal
causes
of
action.
mr.
george
h.
weller
well,
we're
dealing
with
a
federal
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
george
h.
weller
well,
if
we
went
into
the
district
court,
yes,
we'd,
we'd
raise
the
11th
amendment,
if
the
state
was
sued.
and
we
do
do
that.
but
in
this
case--
mr.
george
h.
weller
--we
don't...
no
sir,
we
do
not
raise
it,
we
do
not
rely
on
the
11th
amendment.
not
at
all.
mr.
george
h.
weller
if
you
feel--
mr.
george
h.
weller
--i
believe,
your
honor,
the
history
of
this
court
and
the
cases
involved
show
that
in
order
to
ensure
the
supremacy
of
federal
law...
corens,
for
example,
v.
virginia
requires
that
this
court
entertain
these
actions,
if
it
chooses
to
do
so,
of
course,
on
certiorari,
but
it
has
jurisdiction
to
hear
appeals
on
federal
causes
of
action
coming
from
state
courts
to
determine,
and
analyze
and
determine
whether
the
federal
law
does
or
does
not
apply.
mr.
george
h.
weller
i
don't
believe
this
is
a
valid
argument,
your
honor,
that
a,
a...
the
interpretation
of
a
federal
statute,
by
a
state
court,
interpreting
the
meaning
of
a
federal
statute,
cannot
be
appealed
to
this
court.
i
think
the
thought
processes
of
the
era
are
better
found
in
the
language
of
the
1880
ex
parte
virginia.
the
court
was
speaking
of
the
14th
amendment,
and
the
court
said,
"prohibitions
of
the
14th
amendment
are
addressed
to
the
states.
"
but
then,
one
page
later,
this
court
said,
"such
legislation
must
act
upon
person's,
not
upon
the
abstract
thing
that's
denominated
a
state,
but
upon
the
persons
who
are
the
agents
of
the
state
in
the
denial
of
the
rights
which
are
intended
to
be
secured.
"
our
position
is,
your
honors,
that
congress
could
have
included
the
states
within
the
scope
of
the
1871
civil
rights
act.
it
did
not
do
so.
congress
can
at
any
time,
if
it
chooses,
include
the
states
within
the
scope
of
the
1871
civil
rights
act.
it
has
yet
to
do
so.
thank
you,
your
honors.
