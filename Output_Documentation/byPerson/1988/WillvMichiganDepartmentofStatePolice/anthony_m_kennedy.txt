anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there
any
indications
in
the
debates
showing
concern
over
imposition
of
damage
liability
on
the
states?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
then
not
indicative
of
an
understanding
by
congress
that
such
damage
liability
is
not
encompassed
by
the
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i,
i
take
it
you're
of
the
view
that
the
11th
amendment
clearly
bars
the
suit
in
a
federal
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
aren't
you
here
in
federal
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
isn't
this
the
suit
that's
brought...
if
this
suit
can't
be
brought
in
a
federal
court,
then
how
can
you
be
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
we're
a
federal
court,
and
the
judicial
power
shall
not
extend,
under
the
11th
amendment,
to
this
kind
of
suit.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
11th
amendment
says
you
cannot
be
in
the
federal
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
says,
"the
judicial
power
shall
not
extend.
"
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you'd
be
dealing
with
that
in
the
district
court
too,
i
suppose,
and
you'd
find...
you'd
ask
for
immediate
dismissal,
i
assume.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
don't
raise
it
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
us
why
we
have
jurisdiction
under
the
11th
amendment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but,
no,
no,
the
judiciary
act
of
1789
gave
us
jurisdiction
over
those
matters,
and
there
was
no
11th
amendment
bar.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
11th
amendment
says,
"the
judicial
power
shall
not
extend.
"
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
take
it
we're
a
federal
court.
