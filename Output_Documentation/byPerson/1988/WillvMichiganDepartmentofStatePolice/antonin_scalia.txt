justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
a
little
disingenuous,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
our
whole
theory
in
monell
was
that
cities
are
not,
are
not
states,
that
they
haven't
been
treated
like
states.
i
mean,
to
cite
monell
as,
as
authority
for
what
you
want
us
to
do
here
is
to
really
pull
it
inside-out,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
more
than
that,
i
think
it,
i
think
it,
it...
it's
rationale
refutes
the
statement
you
just
made,
that
any,
any
earlier
case
that
had
to
do
with
the
city
is
somehow
authority
for
suits
against
the
government.
monell
says
quite
the
contrary,
that
the
reason
suits
against
cities
are
allowed
is
that
they
weren't
considered
governments.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
it
queer...
queer
disposition
you're
asking
us
to
end
up
with,
given
quern,
you're...
what
you're
necessarily
suggesting
is
that
in
order
to
protect
individuals
against
the
states,
congress
created
a
cause
of
action
against
the
states,
but
allowed
that
cause
of
action
to
be
sued
upon
only
in
state
courts.
isn't
that
rather
strange?
i
mean,
if,
if
you're
worried
about
the
state's
misbehaving,
it
seems
to
me...
i
could
understand
the
opposite,
allowing
suits
only
in
federal
courts
and
not
in
state
courts.
but
prohibiting
suit
in
federal
courts
and
permitting
it
in
state
courts
seems,
seems
absolutely
inverted.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
think
congress,
in
section...
using
section
5,
could
have,
could
have
set
the
11th
amendment
aside
and
allowed
these
suits?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
we've
decided
that
the
other
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you're,
you're...
this
argument
essentially
is
asking
us
to
over...
overrule
quern.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
they
do
it
by
using
the
same
word,
in
a
fashion
that,
that
has
two
different
meanings?
do
you
know
any
other...
your
argument
is
essentially
that
the
word
"person"
does
not
mean
a
state
for
purposes
of
whether
you
can
bring
a
suit
in
federal
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
congress
used
person
to
mean
state
but
nonetheless
did,
did
not
allow
suit
against
the
state--
justice
antonin
scalia
gee,
i
don't
know
why
you
don't
rely
on
the
11th
amendment,
because...
if
the
11th
amendment
did
apply
to
us
as
well
as
to
other
federal
courts,
and
as
justice
kennedy
points
out
there's
nothing
that
says
it
doesn't,
then
what
your
opponent
would
be
suggesting
is
that
congress
created
federal
causes
of
action
in
state
courts
against
the
states,
they
couldn't
be
appealed
to
the
united
states
supreme
court,
so
there'd
be
no
way
of,
of
giving
any
unity
to
that
particular
federal
law.
that
wouldn't
be
a
very
sensible
arrangement,
would
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
for
an
antitrust
plaintiff,
anyway.
but
i'm
not
sure
for
an
antitrust
defendant.
justice
antonin
scalia
defendant?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
nobody's
perfect.
we,
we
make
mistakes.
