justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
burnham,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
understanding
of
the
state
of
the
law
at
the
time
the
statute
was
enacted?
recently
we
had
a
lot
of
law
on
the
question
of
the
difference
between
a
state
official
being
sued
in
the
official
capacity
and
being
sued
in
an
individual
capacity.
was
that
distinction
as
well-recognized
back
in
the
1860s
as
it,
as
it
is
today,
do
you
know?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
under
your
view,
if
this
action
had
been
brought
against
the
director
of
the
state
police
in
1874,
right
after
the
statute
was
passed,
and
the
judgment
had
been
entered
against
that
official,
would
that
judgment
have
been
payable
by
the
state
or
by
the
individual
at
that
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
that
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
interrupt
there.
why
wouldn't
the
answer
to
that
be,
under
ex
parte
young,
that
you
could
get
injunctive
relief
in
that
situation?
and
that
that
would
be
adequate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know,
but
i
mean,
why
couldn't
the
rationale
of
ex
parte
young
been
applied
in
such
a
case
and,
and
say
that
you're
only
remedy
is
not
for
damages
but
for
injunctive
relief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
back
up
because
i
found
that
very
interesting?
your
first
example
from
hillard
in
1866--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--did
that
contemplate...
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
he
was
suggesting
it
would
be
perfectly
proper
to
get
a
damage
recovery
against
a
state
individual
acting
in
his
official
capacity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
judgment
would
run
against
him
in,
in,
in
his
personal
capacity--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
supposing
he
was
the
head
of
the
michigan
department
of
police
and
done
just
what
had
been
done
here,
would
such
a
judgment...
and
that
had
been
regarded
as
a
tort
at
the
time--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--was...
was
that
what
you
found
in
the
tort
law
treatises
at
the
time,
or
is
that
what
you're
saying
is
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
don't
we
have
an
obligation
to
do
that
ourselves,
if
it
deprives
us
of
jurisdiction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
this
is
a
case,
is
it
not,
that
was,
in
either
law
or
equity,
commenced
against
one
of
the
united
states
by
a,
by
a
citizen?
