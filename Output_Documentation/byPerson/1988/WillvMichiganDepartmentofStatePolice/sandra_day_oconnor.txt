mr.
burnham,
don't
you
think
the
amendment,
the
retroactively-effective
amendment,
of
the
dictionary
act
bears
on
the
meaning
of
persons
in
this
statute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there's
pretty
clear
evidence
of
an
intent
not
to
have
the
language
so
broad
for
the
very
purpose
of
making
sure
it
didn't
include
states.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
don't
you
also
think
that
the
history
of
the
1871
act,
as
outlined
in
monell,
indicates
that
the
framers
of
that
act
thought
they
had
no
constitutional
power
to
impose
an
independent
federal
duty
on
state
officers
or
instrumentalities--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
it
would
be
rather
surprising
in
light
of
that
history
that
they
intended
to
include
the
states?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it's
most
unlikely
in
light
of
the
history
of
that
act
and,
and
the
purpose
of
the
ku
klux
klan
act
that
the
42nd
congress
intended
to
create
a
damage
action
against
state
governments
to
be
heard
in
state
court.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
burnham,
was
section
1
of
the
1871
act
patterned
after
section
2
of
the
1866
civil
rights
act?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
language
is
identical,
in
fact,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
would
you
say
that
section
2
of
the
civil
rights
act
applies
to
states
as
persons,
making
them
criminally
liable?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
your
answer
is
no,
that
it
would
not
make
criminal--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--penalties
enforceable
against
the
state.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
would
we
read
the
word
"person"
in
the
identical
language
in
the
later
act
differently
then,
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
think
that
the
logic
of
the
whole
history
is
to
say
yes,
they
thought
they
could
reach
individual
state
actors
but
not
the
states
themselves.
and
the
whole
thing
makes
sense
when
viewed
in
that
light.
i
think
your
argument
is
somewhat
hard
to
achieve.
