mr.
william
burnham
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1973
petitioner
applied
for
a...
for
a
job
with
the
michigan
state
police
as
a
computer
analyst.
he
was
fully
qualified
for
this
job.
he
did
not
get
it.
and
he
subsequently
found
out
that
the
reason
he
did
not
get
that
was
because
the
michigan
state
police
had
a
so-called
"red
squad"
which
maintained
dossiers
on
persons
who
had
engaged
in
certain
political
activities.
the
plaintiff,
believing
that
he
was
wronged,
sued
in
the
michigan
court
of
claims
under
42
u.s.c.
section
1983,
and
he
recovered
a
judgment
to
redress
this
violation
of
his
federal
constitution
rights.
the
michigan
supreme
court
took
away
that
judgment.
they
did
not
take
away
that
judgment
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
case
on
the
merits,
it's
admitted
now
that
in
fact
the
respondents
did
violate
his
due
process
rights.
it
was
not
taken
away
because
of
any
lack
of
jurisdiction
in
the
michigan
courts
for
handling
such
cases.
michigan
courts
are
fully
competent
to
handle
section
1983
claims,
and
the
michigan
court
of
claims
is
the
court
which
is
specially
constituted
to
hear
claims
against
the
state
of
michigan
and
its
departments.
the
michigan
supreme
court
reversed
the
case
because,
in
its
view,
the
petitioner
had
not
made
out
a
cause
of
action
under
42
u.s.c.
1983,
because
the
respondents
were
not
persons
acting
under
color
of
state
law
within
the
meaning
of
that
statute.
mr.
william
burnham
well,
it
would
depend
on
whether
or
not
the
chief
justice
has
in
mind
state
constitutional
law
or
state
law
of
another
type,
in
other
words
state
tort
law.
under
state
tort
law
this
claim
would
be
barred
by,
by
the
state's
sovereign
immunity.
if
it's
state
constitutional
law,
after
this
very
case
was
decided,
then
the
supreme
court,
the
michigan
supreme
court
in
this
case,
established
that
one
could
in
fact
sue
under
the
state
constitution.
prior
to
that
time,
it
had
not
so
held.
and
consequently,
had
he
had,
had
the
benefit
of
this
very
case
at
the
time
that
he
filed
his
case
perhaps
he
would
have
framed
things
differently.
mr.
william
burnham
but
it
was
not
applied
to
him.
there
were
two
cases,
the
smith
case
and
the
will
case.
and
in
the
will
case
they
determined
that
he
had
not
clearly
made
out...
had
not
clearly
preserved
for
appeal
the
issue
of
the
violation
of
the
state
constitution.
and
in
the
smith
case,
however,
they
had
preserved
it
and
consequently
they
had
to
decide
that
question.
but
this
is
the
first
case
in
which
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
has
indicated
that
a
state
constitutional
claim
would
not
be
barred
by
state
sovereign
immunity.
prior
to
that
and
if
it's
on
any
other
theory,
any
tort
theory,
anything
like
that,
it
would
clearly
be
barred.
it's
petitioner's
position
in
this
case
that
the
respondents,
michigan
department
of
state
police
and
the
director
of
the
michigan
state
police,
are
in
fact
persons
within,
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
for
basically
three
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
statutory
language
says
so,
and
secondly,
the
legislative
history
tells
us
that
as
well,
and
finally
there
was
no
reason
to
depart
from
the
clear
meaning
of
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history
in
order
to
read
those
terms
differently.
in
terms
of
the
language
of
the
statute,
the
well-established
rule
of
statutory
construction
as
far
as
this
very
issue
is
concerned,
is
that
if
there
is
a
federal
statute
which
addresses
activities
that
states
are
equally
capable
of
engaging
in,
that
are
targeted
by
that
statute,
then
the
rule
is
that
"person"
include
states
unless
congress
expressly
excludes
them.
and
in
the
antitrust
laws,
under
the
clayton
act,
and
under
the
sherman
act,
the
robinson-patman
act,
this
court
has
indicated
that
person
in
those
statutes
include
states.
and
the
most
recent
case,
of
course,
is
the
jefferson
county
pharmaceutical
case
at
460
u.s.
in
1983
dealing
with
the
robinson-patman
act.
mr.
william
burnham
i
don't
believe
so.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that,
first
of
all,
it
doesn't
bear
on
it
because
i
don't
believe
that
the
wording
change
that
is
made
in
that,
in
fact,
does
what
respondents
would
say
that
it
does.
in
other
words,
the
1874,
the
new
version
of
the
dictionary
act,
basically
gives
us
the
same
definition
that
is
in
the
antitrust
acts.
in
other
words,
corporations,
associations--
mr.
william
burnham
--well,
that
intent
is
the
intent
of
the
commissioners
of
the
revision
commission,
and
it's
quite
well
established
that
the
revision
commission's
comments
are
not
the
legislative
history
of
that
statute.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
revision
commission
was
fired
by
congress
because
it
made
too
many
changes,
and
in
fact
it's
been
noted
by
every
commentator
that
in
fact
that
is
not
part
of
the
legislative
history.
that
may,
may
have
been
the
intent
of
the
revisors,
but
congress
in
passing
the
1874
code
clearly
did
not
rely
on
that,
they
relied
on
mr.
durant's
revisions
of
the
code.
and
mr.
durant,
in
fact,
went
through
and
tried
to
make
as
many
changes
back
to
the
original
language
as
possible.
the
only
explanation
is
that
congress
simply,
at
the
last
minute,
felt
it
needed
a
code,
it
passed
and
had
the
task,
task
before
it
to
pass,
all
of
the
statutes
that
theretofore
had
been
passed
as
part
of
the
code,
and
simply
passed
it.
mr.
william
burnham
i
don't
believe
that
that
is--
mr.
william
burnham
--i
think
that
what
congress
was
speaking
of
is
the
type
of
liability
that
was,
that
was
dealt
with
in
the
subject
at
hand,
which
of
course
was
the
sherman
amendment.
and
the
sherman
amendment
did,
did
not
deal
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
and
this
court
of
course
found
in
monell,
did
not
deal
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
states
or
for
that
matter
municipalities
that
took
action
that
violated
constitutional
rights
could
not
be
subjected
to
liability.
that
was
not
the
question.
the
question
was
whether
or
not
a
duty
to
maintain
a
police
force
could
be
imposed
upon
counties
as
subdivisions
of
states
by
way
of
this
vicarious
liability
in
the
sherman
amendment.
mr.
william
burnham
well,
the
question
of
state
court,
i
think,
has
to
be
separated
from
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
cause
of
action
is,
is
set
out.
in
other
words,
congress
clearly
in
section
1
was
authorizing
a
remedy
to
be
brought.
now,
congress
did
indicate
that
remedy...
it
was
also
at
the
same
time
creating
jurisdiction
without
regard
to
amount
of
controversy
in
the
federal
courts.
however,
at
that
time
and
today
and
since
mr.
hamilton
wrote
federalist
no.
82,
it's
been
quite
clear
that
the
standard
is
that
there
was
concurrent
jurisdiction
in
state
courts
unless
congress
makes
that
exclusive.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
section
of,
of,
of
federalist
no.
82
was
actually
read
on
the
floor
of
the
congress
at
the
time
in
the
debates
at
the
time
that
section
1983
was
being
considered.
congress
was
fully
advised
of
that,
this
court
has
noted
that
there's
jurisdiction,
concurrent
jurisdiction,
in
state
courts,
in
addition
to
which
we
must
keep
in
mind
the
fact
that
from
the
time
of
the
constitution
until
1875
federal
questions,
including
federal
constitutional
questions,
could
only
be
brought
in
the
state
courts.
it's
highly
unlikely
that
congress
would
have
forgotten
that
at
the
time
that
it
was
authorizing
the
cause
of
action
to
enforce
the
14th
amendment.
i
might
also
add
that
the
slaughterhouse
cases
were
filed
in
1870,
and
the
slaughterhouse
cases
were,
of
course,
filed
in
the,
the
louisiana
state
court
as
a
means
of
enforcing
the
14th
amendment.
and
consequently
anyone
who
is
familiar
with
the
slaughterhouse
cases,
and
of
course
they
were
quite
notable
at
the
time,
in
the
news
media
and
otherwise,
would
have
known
that
that
was
an
example
of
enforcing
the
14th
amendment
in
state
court.
mr.
william
burnham
no,
no
they
were
not.
the
filing
of
that
predated
the
statute.
the
first
reported
case,
i
believe,
under
section
1983,
i
believe,
was
in
<eighteen
seventy-three>
[=
1873]
in
the
circuit
court
in
illinois,
i
believe.
and
that,
interest...
interestingly
enough,
was
a
suit
by
a
company
against
the
city
of
hyde
park.
in
other
words,
a
suit
against
a,
a
governmental
subdivision,
an
entity
in
that
case.
and
that
case,
of
course,
was
relied
on
in
this
court,
by
this
court,
in
the
monell
case,
in
436
u.s.
and
consequently
the
statute
was
not
used
at
that
time.
mr.
william
burnham
well,
i
agree
that
monell
does
not
cover
the
precise
question
in
this
case.
however--
mr.
william
burnham
--no,
i,
i
don't
believe
that
that...
the
rationale
of
monell,
as
i
understand
monell,
is
that
there's
no
reason
to
exclude
cities
because
of
the
fact
that
the
sherman
amendment
was
defeated
or
for
any
other
reason,
that
cities,
the
entity
itself
is
as
capable
as
the
officers
of
that
city
of
engaging
in
the
kinds
of
activities
that
were
the
focus
of
the,
of
section
1
of
the
1871
act.
and
consequently
there
was
no
reason
in
the
sherman
amendment,
which
of
course
monroe
v.
pape
held,
excluded
cities,
there
was
no
reason
to
read
its
defeat
as
meaning
that
cities
were
excluded.
but
simply
the
fact
that
cities
were
as
capable
of
engaging
in
those
kinds
of
depredations
that
the
court
believed
that
there
was
no
reason
to
exclude
them.
and
of
course,
the
dictionary
act
was
relied
on...
upon
in
monell,
and
the
dictionary
act
did
not
refer
to
cities
or
counties,
it
said
bodies,
corporate
and
politic.
and
of
course
those
very
words
were
used
by
the
senators
and
members
of
the
house
who
debated
section
1981
on
the
floor
of
the
congress
to
describe
states.
and
no
one
has
ever
doubted
that
states
certainly
come
within
that,
that
definition.
and
that
definition,
we
believe,
although
it
was
changed
in
1874,
this
court
has
never
taken
the
view
that
that
somehow
retroactively
clarified
congressional
intent
as
the
respondents
would
have
the
court
believe.
mr.
william
burnham
well,
the
crux
of
the
matter
is
that
congress
did
not
do
that.
in
other
words,
the
reason
that
matters
of
this
sort...
in
other
words
if
this
case
were
thought
in
federal
court,
it's
quite
clear
it
would
be
barred.
the
reason
that
this
case
would
be
barred
in
federal
court
is
not
because
congress
said
it
could
not
be
brought
there
but
because
the
11th
amendment
says
that
the
state
cannot
be
sued
in
federal
court.
in
other
words,
congress
did
not
by
use
of
the
term
"person
acting
under,
under
color
of
state
law.
"
mean
that
as
a
term
of
limitation.
congress
was,
was
simply
setting
up
the
cause
of
action.
and
there
is
a
defense,
of
course,
of
the
11th
amendment,
which
defeats
that
cause
of
action.
however,
in
state
court
where
that
defense
is
not
available
to
the
state,
then
the
cause
of
action
has
greater
force.
mr.
william
burnham
congress
certainly
could
have
done
that,
had
congress,
number
one,
thought
that
the
11th
amendment
was
a
problem,
and
number
two,
believed
that
or
had
the
foresight
to
forecast
this
court's
decision
in
cases
such
as
hutto
v.
finney
and
atascadero.
in
other
words,
the
clear
statement
kind
of
rule.
petitioners
believe,
as
we
indicate
in
our,
in
our
brief,
that
because
hans
v.
louisiana
was
not
decided
until
20
years
later
that
it's
highly
unlikely
that
congress
would
have
thought
that
there
was
an
11th
amendment
bar
to
a
federal
question
claim.
hans
v.
louisiana
quite
clearly
relied
on
only
recent
precedent.
there
was
no
occasion
for
deciding
that
issue
before,
it
would
not
have
been
established
until
1890.
and
consequently
the
respondents
would
impute
some
sort
of
intent
to
congress
to
limit
a
cause
of
action
based
on
an
assumption
about
the
11th
amendment,
when
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
that
they
thought
that
the
11th
amendment
would
be
a
problem.
mr.
william
burnham
well,
i--
mr.
william
burnham
--well,
quern
doesn't
necessarily
do
that.
quern,
i
think,
applies
a
modern
standard
for
abrogating
the
11th
amendment.
that
modern
standard
is
one
that
applies
from
that
day
forward,
but
this
court
has
also
said
it
will
look
at
prior
statutes
including
the
jones
act
and
the
welch
case
and
other
statutes
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
congress,
in
fact,
did
abrogate
11th
amendment
immunity.
and
that
of
course
is
a
separate
issue
from
the
cause
of
action
question,
because
congress
must,
must
not
just
authorize
suit
against
the
state,
congress
must
make
its
intent
clear,
must
have
considered
the
11th
amendment
and
firmly
decided
to
abrogate
it.
in
the
vernacular
i
suppose
you
could
say
congress
is
saying
not
only
that
the
states
can
be
sued
but
also,
read
my
lips,
we
mean
it,
the
states
can
be
sued.
and
it's
only
then
that
the
11th
amendment
is
abrogated.
it
is
not
necessary
in
order
to
establish
a
cause
of
action
to
do
that.
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
assumed,
in
atascadero,
in
the
welch
case,
and
in
employees
v.
missouri
department
of
public
welfare,
that
in
fact
there
is
a
cause
of
action
that
is
left
over,
once
one
decides
that
11th
amendment
issue.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
atascadero
the
court
made
it
quite
clear
that
the
decision
did
not
mean
there
was
not
a
remedy.
the
decision
simply
meant
that
that
remedy
would
have
to
be
pursued
in
state
court.
it
is
not...
it
is
a
common
situation
with
federal
statutes
that
establish
causes
of
action
for
which
there
is
a
defense
in
one
form
but
not
a
defense
in
another
form.
mr.
william
burnham
no.
the
word
"person"
does
mean
a
state,
in
federal
court
as
well.
it
simply
means
that
that
suit
is
barred,
if
the
11th
amendment
is
applicable.
for
example,
this
court
has
indicated...
in
the
state
of
rhode
island,
the
legislature
of
rhode
island
has
waived
its
11th
amendment
immunity
by
statute.
and
in
that
case
the
first
circuit
indicated,
well,
then
we
have
to
go
on
to
decide
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
a
cause
of
action
under
section
1983.
and
we
hold
that
the
state
is
a
person,
in
the
della
grotta
case.
in
other
words,
two
separate
issues
of
whether
or
not
it's
barred
by
the
11th
amendment
and
whether
or
not
there's
a
cause
of
action.
if
those
two
issues
were
the
same,
then
we
would
never
be
able
to
have
a
cause
of
action,
once
the
consent
by
the
state
was
given.
mr.
william
burnham
congress
allowed
suit
against
the
state
in
the
sense
of
authorizing
the
cause
of
action.
however,
congress
did
not
engage
in
the
kind
of
super-intent,
in
other
words
the
clear
statement
necessary
under
cases
like
atascadero,
in
order
to
abrogate
it.
in
other
words,
the
two
questions
of
whether
or
not
there's
a
cause
of
action,
and
the
second
question
of
whether
or
not
that
cause
of
action
might
be
barred.
and
the
state...
petitioners'
position
is
the
state
is
a
person
for
all
purposes,
for
purposes
of
cause
of
action.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
they
can
be
sued
in
federal
court
is
a
question
of
the
defense
that
the
state
might
raise.
mr.
william
burnham
i
don't
believe
that
it
was.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
a
lot
of
the
law
of
whether
or
not
one
is
suing
in
the
official
capacity
or
in
a
personal
capacity
is
overshadowed
by
11th
amendment
laws,
especially
starting
with
ex
parte
young.
and
it's
very
difficult
to
separate
that.
i
believe
that
the
understanding
of
the
1872,
'71
congress
could
well
have
been
the
understanding
that
was
reflected
the,
the
year
later
in
davis
11th
amendment.
mr.
william
burnham
that
would
be...
either
option
if
possible.
however,
i
believe
that
the
option
that
is
more
likely
is
that
it
would
be
paid
by
the
state.
mr.
william
burnham
at
that
time.
representative
bingham
gave
an
example
of
the
kinds
of
rights
that
he
believed
were
protected
by
section
1983.
one
of
those
rights
that
he
gave
us
that
he
believed
that
the
case
of
barron
v.
mayor
of
baltimore
should
apply
to
states
and
cities.
and
consequently
he
viewed
just
compensation
claims
as
being
the
kinds
of
claims
that
could
be
brought
under
the
statute.
now,
if
a
state
officer
who
actually
goes
out
and
seizes
that
property
is
the
one
who
was
personally
liable
for
that,
it
would
be
highly
unlikely
that
that
is
what
bingham
had
in
mind.
and
as
justice
powell
concluded
in
his
concurrence
in
monell,
there
is
no
indication
that
they
intended
somehow
that
only
personal
liability
of
the
officer
would
be
involved
in
these
kinds
of
cases.
there's
another
example
that
is
given
by
an
opponent
in
the
legislative
history,
by
representative
blair,
and
that
is,
what
if
slavery
were
reimposed
in
a
particular
state?
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
that,
that
the
statute
seems
to
go
to.
and
the
representative
pointed
out
that
quite
clearly
that
is
a
case
where
the
state
itself
does
it,
and
consequently
the
liability
should
run
with
the
state.
it
should
not
run
with
the
individual
officers
who
happen
to
have
the
misfortune
of
being
the
ones
who
are
sent
out
to
enforce
that
law.
i
suppose,
to
use
an
example
from
this
case
that
would
ring
true
in
1871
terms,
if
in
fact
a
statute
said,
state
government
cannot
hire
black
people,
and
the
petitioner
were
denied
that
job
pursuant
to
that
state
statute,
respondents
would
have
this
court
say
that
the
only
remedy
is
to
sue
that
personnel
interviewer
who
says,
my
hands
are
tied,
i
can't
hire
you.
the
state
law
says
that
i,
i
have
to
reject
your
application.
that
kind
of
liability
doesn't
make
a
lot
of
sense.
and
if
you
read
through
the
legislative
history
and
look
at
the--
mr.
william
burnham
--well,
of
course,
ex
parte
young
was
not
for
another
30
years.
mr.
william
burnham
well,
it
would
be
highly
unlikely
that
that
would
be
the
case,
if
congress
says
right
in
the
statute
that
whatever
this
remedy
is
against
persons
is,
in
the
words
of
the
statute,
a...
an
action
at
law,
suit
in
equity,
or
other
proper
proceeding
for
redress.
in
other
words,
if
congress
had
that
in
mind,
certainly
there
was
a
clearer
way
of
saying
it.
and
if
in
fact
action
at
law
and
suit
in
equity
are
the
kinds
of
things
that
are...
that
are
available
against
that
person,
then
certainly
there's
no
basis
for
saying
that
somehow
the
statute
means,
well,
person
if
it's
a
suit
in
equity
but
not
a
person
if
it's
a
suit
at
law.
congress
did
not
say
that.
and
it
quite
clearly
could
have
said
that.
it
simply
did
not.
mr.
william
burnham
i
believe
the
term
that
this
court
has,
has
used
and
is,
gleaning
from
the
legislative
history,
is
that
it
was
a
model
for--
mr.
william
burnham
--the
language...
in
fact,
the
language
is
identical.
mr.
william
burnham
well,
at
the
time,
of
course,
the...
the
criminal
liability
could
only
be
visited
on
individuals.
in
other
words--
mr.
william
burnham
--no,
it
would
not.
mr.
william
burnham
no,
in
other
words,
the
state
could
not
be
imprisoned
under
that
law.
mr.
william
burnham
well,
there
are
a
couple
of
reasons.
the
first
reason
is
that
the
1866
act
led
to
the
14th
amendment.
in
other
words,
the
reason
why
the
14th
amendment
was
written
and
passed
by
congress,
in
large
part,
was
because
they
believed
that
there
were
constitutional
problems
with
the
1866
act.
and
consequently,
a
more
generalized
version
of
the
1866
criminal
law
is
what
gave
us
the
current
section
1
of
the
14th
amendment.
in
that
broader
context,
in
other
words
outside
of
the
narrow
criminal
context,
congress
chose
the
words,
"no
state
shall",
and
consequently
congress
is
telling
us
by
doing
that
that
this
kind
of
liability
that
they're
talking
about
is
at
the
very
least
official
capacity
liability,
and
certainly
in
a
broader
context
where
we're
talking
about
the
non-criminal
situation,
that
that
is
a
situation
where
it
is
the
state
itself
that
is
prohibited
from
doing
that.
now,
then,
after...
that
was
in
1866,
then
1868
the
14th
amendment,
then
in
1871
they
want
to
enforce
the
14th
amendment,
they
go
back
and
simply
use
the
old
language
from
the
1866
statute.
but
they
indicate
in
the
preamble
that
they
are
enforcing
the
provisions
of
the
14th
amendment,
which
of
course
says
itself,
"no
state
shall".
the
second
reason
is
that
the
kind
of
liability
that
they
spoke
of
in
the
1866
act,
and
the
use
to
which
it
was
put
historically,
was
to
render
criminally
liable
judges,
other
officials,
for
official
capacity
actions.
in
other
words,
the
actions
that
were
brought
were
in
fact
actions
that
were
brought
for
a
judge,
for
example,
excluding
blacks
from
a
jury,
pursuant
to
a
state
statute.
that
judge
was
arrested
and
tried
before
the
federal
court
for
doing
that.
that
is
precisely
the
kind
of
official
capacity
type
action
which
we
are
talking
about
here.
mr.
william
burnham
well,
it's,
it's
very
hard
to
account
for
the
many
references
about
states
being
the
object
of
section
1.
in
other
words,
we
are
handicapped
to
a
certain
extent
by
the
fact
that
congress
was
more
excited
about,
and
debated
more,
the
other
sections,
which
perhaps
were
more
problematic
and
did
not
have
such
debate
on
section
1.
but
everyone
who
referred
to
section
1,
and,
and
the
quotations
are
in
the
brief,
refers
to
the
fact
that
it
was
meant
to
reach
violations
by
the
state
itself
in
its
corporate
and
legislative
capacity.
mr.
william
burnham
not
that
i
have
been
able
to
find,
your
honor.
the...
the
11th
amendment
apparently,
for
example,
is
not
mentioned
at
all
in
the
debates.
mr.
william
burnham
well,
to
the
extent
that
congress
was
worried
about
a
few
other
things,
such
as
in
the
other
sections
military
takeover
of
state
governments,
which
obviously
is
much
more
intrusive
of
state
sovereignty
than
a
simple
damage
award,
suspending
habeas
corpus
in
the
areas
where
state
authorities
were
not
able
to
control
things.
those
were
the
kinds
of
things
that
congress
debated.
mr.
william
burnham
absolutely.
in
other
words,
the
concern
was
that
state
governments
were
in
fact
allowing
all
sorts
of
violations
by
individuals
and
were
not
enforcing
the
law,
as
well
as
the
fact
that
they
themselves
might
have
affirmative
laws
which
in
fact
denied
rights
to,
to
the
former
freed
persons.
mr.
william
burnham
uhm.
but
there
are
several
references
in
the
legislative
history.
for
example,
senator
edmunds,
who
was
the
floor
manager
of
the
bill
and
he
was
the
chairman
of
joint
committee
that
investigated
the
whole
problem,
indicated
that
section
1
simply
reenacts
the
constitution.
he
did
not
say
that
it
reenacts
the
constitution
except
for
the
part
that
says,
"no
state
shall".
representative
bingham
talks
about
it's
a
remedy
provided
against
all
such
abuses
and
denials
of
rights
in
states
and
by
states,
and
he
didn't
say
except
ones
that
are
pursuant
to
state
statute
that
are
perpetrated
by
the
state
itself.
representative
sheilabarger,
who
was
a
sponsor
of
the
bill,
indicated
that
the
states
remained
unrestrained,
and
therefore
there's
a
need
for
this
remedy.
and
that
was
not,
certainly,
as
a
prelude
to
introducing
a
bill
that
does
not
restrain
states
themselves.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
burnham
thank
you.
a
couple
of
matters
by,
by
way
of
response.
first
of
all,
i
believe
counsel
for
respondents
indicated
that
it
was
somehow
rare
that
states
would
be
persons
under
the,
under
the
federal
laws.
however,
i
did
not
mention
the
liquor
tax
laws
in
which
the
definition
is
partnership,
association,
company,
or
corporation,
as
well
as
natural
persons.
this
court
has
held
that
the
state
is
a
person.
the
shipping
act,
corporations,
partnerships,
and
associations
existing
under
or
authorized
by
the
laws
of
any
state,
that
includes
the
state.
the
antitrust
definition
is
precisely
corporations
and
associations
existing
under
or
authorized
by
the
laws
of
any
state.
the
court
has
held
in
all
those
circumstances
that
the
state
is
in
fact
a
person.
secondly--
mr.
william
burnham
--no.
jefferson
county
was
an
antitrust
defendant.
mr.
william
burnham
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
of
the
arguments
that
was
made
was
that
person
should
mean
something
different
if
it's
a
plaintiff
than
if
it's
a
defendant.
and
it
was
precisely
that
argument
that
was
rejected
by
the
court.
in
fact,
if
you're
a
person
you're
either
in
or
out
of
that
definition,
and
it
doesn't
vary
depending
on
the
circumstances.
and
of
course,
that
rule
is
followed
in
a
slightly
different
way
in
the
civil
rights
context,
that
this
court
held
in
kenosha
v.
bruno,
that
you
can't
bifurcate
person
somehow
according
to
relief.
either
they
are
persons
or
they're
not,
and
if
they
are
there
as
congress
says,
action
at
law,
suits
in
equity...
everything
applies.
mr.
william
burnham
well,
cohens
v.
virginia.
i
think
counsel
is
correct,
that
in
fact
an
appeal
is
not
considered
to
be
an
action
prosecuted
against
a
state
for
purposes
of
the
11th
amendment.
mr.
william
burnham
well--
mr.
william
burnham
--that's
true.
it
would--
mr.
william
burnham
--yes.
i
would
agree
with
that.
the
difficulty,
of
course,
is
that
this
court,
if
the
court
wanted
to
take
that
matter
up
anew,
would
have
to
reverse
several
prior
cases.
maine
v.
thiboutot
was
a
1983
action
brought
in
state
court.
this
court
decided
the
attorney
fee
issue
in
that
case
without
ever
noting
that
there
was
any
problem.
martinez
v.
california
is
another
state
court
section
1983
action
that
came
up.
obviously
in
all
those
cases
the
court
would
have
been
obligated
to
note
the
11th
amendment
problem,
and
to
simply
dismiss
the
case.
there
are
all
kinds
of
cases
that
are
brought
with
federal--
mr.
william
burnham
--in,
in,
in
the
interest
of
stare
decisis,
i
would
suggest,
however,
that
that
perhaps
is,
is,
is
water
over
the
dam
and
has
been
for,
for
almost,
almost
150
years.
mr.
weller
also
indicated,
i
believe,
that,
that
there
were
no
suits
against
states
prior
to
1871.
and
in
fact
in,
in
petitioner's
reply
brief
we
indicate
wilson
v.
new
jersey
was
a
suit
in
state
court
against
the
state
of
new
jersey
in
1812,
woodruff
v.
trapnell
was
a
suit
against
a
bank
receiver
in
their
official
capacity
in
1850,
of
course
curran
v.
arkansas
in
1857.
and
curran
v.
arkansas
is
an
interesting
case
for
another
purpose,
and
that
gets
to
the
next
matter
i
would
like
to
address,
and
that
is
the
question
of
the
jurisdiction
of
state
courts
to
handle
section
1983
claims.
in
fact,
there
is
no
question
about
concurrent
jurisdiction.
in
other
words,
the
court
does
not
have
to
reach
that
because
the
michigan
supreme
court
quite
clearly
indicated
that
michigan
courts
have
jurisdiction
over
those
cases,
and
moreover
that
michigan's
sovereign
immunity
is
no
bar
to
any
of
those
actions.
and
consequently
the
sole
reason
why
the
michigan
supreme
court
decided
the
case,
as
it
did,
was
because
it
believed
that
the
state
was
not
a
person,
i.e.
there
was
not
a
cause
of
action
against
the
state.
i
might
not
have
been
exactly
clear
in
responding
to
justice
scalia's
question
about
the
nature
of
the
11th
amendment
bar.
i
would
like
to
indicate
that
in
the
antitrust
area,
for
example,
the
distinction
is
also
made
between
the
cause
of
action
and
the
defense
of
the
11th
amendment.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
even
though,
under
the
antitrust
laws,
the
state
is
a
person
who
may
be
sued
under
the
antitrust
laws,
the
11th
amendment
bars
damages
relief.
and
consequently
it
did
not
affect
the
court's
decision
that
states
were
persons.
they
were
nonetheless
persons--
