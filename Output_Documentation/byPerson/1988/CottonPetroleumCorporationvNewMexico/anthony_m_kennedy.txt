so,
does
the
state's
authority
to
tax
or
its
lack
of
authority
to
tax
depend
upon
the
particular
royalty
agreement,
or
does
it
depend
upon
the
economic
market
for
oil
and
gas
drilling?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
market
conditions
were
such
that
the
indians
could
be
successful
in
leasing
their
lands
only
it
they
gave
a
reduced
royalty
in
order
to
account
for
a
state
tax,
would
that
change
the
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
then
dr.
parker's
findings,
et
cetera,
are
simply
irrelevant
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
and
the...
and
the
fact
that
the,
the
ability
of
the
tribes
to
develop
their
resources
was,
was
not
adversely
affected
by
the
tax.
that's
just
irrelevant
because
of
the
structure
of
the
transaction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
then...
so,
then
the
fact
that
there's
a
royalty
arrangement
is
not
necessarily
dispositive.
it
depends
upon
the
economic
impact
of
the
particular
tax
on
the
particular
transaction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
while
you're
on
that
point,
is
it
the
1927
act
or
the
1938
act
that
carries...
that
controls
the
case
because
if
you
say
the
1938
act,
we
have
the...
the
crow
tribe
case
to
contend
with,
don't
you?
