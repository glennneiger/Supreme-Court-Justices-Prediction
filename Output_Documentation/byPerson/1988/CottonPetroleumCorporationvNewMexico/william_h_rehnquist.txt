we'll

argument
next
in
no.
87-1327,
the
cotton
petroleum
corporation
v.
new
mexico.
mr.
israel,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
transcript,
page
such
and
such,
unrebutted.
i
mean,
a
trial
court
is
free
to
disbelieve
any
witness
it
wants
to
disbelieve
whether
he's
rebutted
or
not,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
so,
how
does
that
bear
on
it?
i
mean,
that's
your
version
of
the
facts,
but
why,
why
should
we
accept
them?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
trial
court
heard
the
witnesses.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
the
trial
court
chose
to
disbelieve
your
witness.
you
don't
need
a...
you
don't
need
contrary
evidence.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
our
cases
have,
as
you
pointed
out
in
mcclanahan
and
cases...
impose
very
definite
limits
on
the
extent
to
which
the
state
can
tax
a
tribal
activity
denominated
as
a
tribal
activity.
i
don't
think
our
case...
our
opinions
have
ever
gone
so
far
as
you
have
us
say
and
say
that
just
because
the
state
tax
on
a
producer
rather
than
on
the
tribe
has
some
effect
on
the
tribe,
it's
similarly
preempted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--one
might
think
that
an
express
mandate
was
more
required
in
the
case
of
federal
lands
than
in
the
case
of
indian
lands.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
don't
some
of
our
cases
hold
that
federal
production
on
federal
lands
couldn't
be
taxed
without
some
sort
of
congressional
approval
of
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
a
tripe
should
be
treated
just
like
another
state
then.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
have
we
ever
held
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you're
asking
us
to
extend
our
doctrine
then.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
tribe
which
lies
wholly
within
the
geographic
boundaries
of
the
state.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
israel.
mr.
stratton,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
where
new
mexico?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
d-u-l-c-e?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stratton.
now,
mr.
israel,
you
have
six
minutes
remaining.
let
me
ask
you,
if
i
may,
in
the
new
mexico
court
of
appeals'
opinion
in
this
case
at
appendix
4
of
your
jurisdictional
statement,
it
has
this
statement,
about
the
middle
of
the
page.
"cotton,
on
the
other
hand,
contends
that
this
case
is
not
a
preemption
case
because
the
economic
impact
on
the
tribe
is
minimal
and
is
not
a
primary
consideration.
"
now,
is
that
a
correct
statement
of
the
position
you
took
in
the
new
mexico
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
if
you
said
in
the
new
mexico
court
of
appeals
that
it
is
not
a
preemption
case--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
but
i...
let
me
read
again
what
the
new
mexico
court
of
appeals
said
you
said,
and
i
asked
you
whether
that
was
a
correct
statement.
"cotton,
on
the
other
hand,
contends
this
is
not,
a
preemption
case
because
the
economic
impact
on
the
tribe
is
minimal
and
is
not
a
primary
consideration.
"
now,
is
that
a
correct
statement
of
the
position
you
took
in
the
new
mexico
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
court
was
wrong
then
in
saying
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
israel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
87-1327
cotton
petroleum
company
against
new
mexico
will
be
announced
by
