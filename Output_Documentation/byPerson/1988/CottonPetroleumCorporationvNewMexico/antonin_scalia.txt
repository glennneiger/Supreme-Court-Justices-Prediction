i

is
what
you're
referring
to.
justice

congress
said
something,
and
congress
hasn't
said
a
thing
in
fact.
it
did
not
enact
any
statute
that
provides
for
this.

well,
after
you...
after
you
throw
it
into,
into
the
commerce
clause
matrix,
you
still
have
to
decide
under
the
commerce
clause
which...
which
of
the
states,
given
conflicting
state
taxations,
is
the
one
that
has
authority
to
tax
or
how
it
should
be
apportioned.
but
having
thrown
it
in
the
matrix,
all
you
do
is
then
assume,
well,
it's
obviously
the
indians
who
can't
and
the
state
who
can.
and
i
don't
know
why
that's
obvious.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
local
to
the
state
as
well
as
local
to
the
reservation
inasmuch
as
the
reservation
is
in
the
state.
local
doesn't
help
you
there.
