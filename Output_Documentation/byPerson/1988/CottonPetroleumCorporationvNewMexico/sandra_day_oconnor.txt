mr.
israel,
the
new
mexico
court
i
believe
found
that
the
taxes
here
did
not
interfere
with
the
tribe's
economic
development
or
its
sovereignty.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
and
do
we
give
any
deference
to
that
finding
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
standard
do
we
apply
in
reviewing
their
finding
in
that
regard?
no
deference
to
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
de
novo?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
are
either
the
royalties
produced
or
the
production
rates
significantly
affected
by
the
state
taxes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
i
understand
correctly
that
from
now
on...
i
mean,
after
this
thing
arose...
the
tribe
took
the
position
that
it
would
be
a
partner
in
any
oil
and
gas
deals
and
thereby
preclude
the
state
from
having
any
taxes
on
it?
is
that
right?
is
that
what's
happening
now?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
uh-hum.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
it
were
a
joint
arrangement
here
with
the
tribe?
then
presumably
no
tax,
no
state
tax.
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
don't.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
there
authority
now
for...
for
joint
arrangements?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
tribe
is
not
taking
advantage
of
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
room
in
that
balancing
test
to
take
into
consideration
what
congress
intended?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
looking
at
the
old
leasing
acts,
there
certainly
is
some
room
there
to
indicate
or
to
find
that
congress
intended
the
states
to
still
be
able
to
do
some
taxation
of
non-indian
producers,
isn't
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
a
joint
venture?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
stratton,
it
does
seem
clear
that
the
addition
of
state
taxes
over
and
above
the
tribal
taxes
on
oil
and
gas
production
coming
off
the
reservation
does
burden
that
production
to
a
greater
degree
than
it
would
if
it
were
on
state
land
alone
and
off
the
reservation.
now,
do
we
have
to
take
that
burden
into
account
in
determining
the
preemption
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
does
the
record
disclose
that
it
may
have
hindered
further
development
of
production
on
the
reservation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
just
it
seems
like
common
sense
would
tell
you
that
if
you
had
two
tracts
where
you
could
produce
oil
and
gas,
one
off
the
reservation
and
one
on,
that
the
producer
would
prefer
the
off-reservation
because
of
the
substantially
reduced
tax
burden.
