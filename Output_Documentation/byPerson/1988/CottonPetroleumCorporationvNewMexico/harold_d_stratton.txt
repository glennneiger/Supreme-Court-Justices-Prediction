mr.
harold
d.
stratton
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case
dealing
with
whether
new
mexico
can
tax
oil
companies
within
its
boundaries
because
those
oil
companies
obtain
their
income
by
the
purchase
from
indian
tribes.
it
is
not
a
case
about
whether
the
tribes
can
tax
the
oil
companies.
this
court
decided
that
in
1982
when
21
of
the
oil
companies
doing
business
on
this
same
reservation
sued
the
tribe.
and
this
court
has
determined
that
they
can.
and
new
mexico
has
no
quarrel
with
that,
and
new
mexico
had
no
quarrel
with
that
back
in
1982.
it's
also
not
a
case
about
whether
the
federal
government,
i
take
it,
can
impose
its
taxes.
we
talk
about
multiple
taxation.
the
federal
income
tax
on
cotton
as
far
as
the
income
it
receives
and
the
windfall
profits
tax
is
just
as
much
multiple
taxation
by
another
concentric
sovereign.
the
two
taxes
which
we
deal
with
here
today...
and
cotton
has
waived
its
claim
to
three,
as
i
understand
their
brief...
are
first
the
oil
and
gas
emergency
school
tax
which
was
originally
enacted
in
1935,
and
the
oil
and
gas
severance
tax
was
a...
which
is
a
tax
on
the
severance
and
the
sale
of
oil
and
gas,
which
was
enacted
in
1937.
both
of
these
taxes
were
recodified
in
1959.
now,
before
these
taxes
are
imposed
upon
the
oil
company,
they
are
allowed
to
deduct
the
royalties
they
pay
the
tribe.
so,
absolutely
no
economic
impact,
whether
it's
incidental
or
otherwise,
falls
upon
the
tribe
in
this
case.
the
royalties
are
deducted
and
they
don't
bear
the
brunt
of
any
of
the
taxes,
nor
do
the
oil
companies
have
to
pay
those
taxes.
additionally,
there
is
no
agreement
in
this
case,
as
there
were
in
the
other
cases
beginning
with
the
white
mountain
case,
the
central
machinery
case
and
the
ramah
case,
to
refund
this
tax
to
the
tribe.
this
tax
refund
would
go
right
back
to
the
oil
company
and
any
future
savings,
if
the
court
struck
the
tax
down,
would
go
to
the
oil
company.
mr.
harold
d.
stratton
justice
kennedy,
i
believe
the
state's
ability
to
tax
depends
upon
whose
income
it
is.
if
it's
the
income
of
the
indian
tribe,
whether
it's
a
joint
venture
or
otherwise
or
whether
it's
a
royalty
arrangement,
the
state
of
new
mexico
cannot
impose
any
tax
on
that
income.
however,
if
it's
income
of
a
non-indian
citizen,
then
that
tax
is
imposed.
mr.
harold
d.
stratton
justice
o'connor,
a
joint
venture
would
work
the
same
way.
in
a
joint
venture,
each
party
would
obtain
some
benefits
from
that
joint
venture.
the
indian
share
would
not
be
taxed
under
new
mexico
law
whatever
that
happened
to
be,
and
the
oil
company
share
would
be
subject
to
the
tax,
just
as
in
this
case.
mr.
harold
d.
stratton
i
don't
believe
that
it
would
change
the
case,
justice
kennedy.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
regard
to
these
leases,
all
of
which
were
executed
back
in
1953,
these
leases
last
as
long
as
gas...
oil
and
gas
is
produced
in
paying
quantities.
so,
it
certainly
wouldn't
affect
these
leases.
mr.
harold
d.
stratton
dr.
farker's
findings
regarding
the
production?
mr.
harold
d.
stratton
i
don't
believe
it's
irrelevant,
your
honor.
i
think
in
this
case
below
they
were
arguing
preemption
and
looking
at
the
various
cases
that
were
involved.
and
under
the
preemption
test
as
set
out
in
white
mountain,
it
might
be
very
relevant
as
to
whether
the
tribes
could...
whether
the
production
of
the
tribes
was
concerned.
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
harold
d.
stratton
--well,
your
honor,
that's
not
our
case.
we
believe
it
depends
upon
the
intent
of
congress
and
whether
congress
intended
the
state
of
new
mexico
to
be
able
to
tax
oil
companies
on
reservations.
we
believe
that
back
when
the
1927
act
was
passed
that
congress
made
that
intention
clear
and
specifically
authorized
the
states
to
do
that.
mr.
harold
d.
stratton
yes,
your
honor,
we
do
have
to
contend
with
the
crow
tribe
case.
i
think,
if
i
may
explain
how
i
think
the
acts
interact
and
how
they
work
together.
the
1938
act
had
a
repealer
clause
in
it
which
only
repealed
acts
that
were
inconsistent
with
it.
there's
a
long
history
leading
up
to
the
passage
of
the
1938
act
which
began
back
with
the
1927
act.
prior
to
1927,
there
was
a
great
debate
in
this
country
between
the
attorney
general,
the
indian
tribes
and
the
federal
government
as
to
whether
or
who
owned
the
property
under
executive
order
reservations.
in
1922,
this
court
held
in
gillespie
v.
oklahoma
that
states
could
not
tax
lessees'
interests
on
indian
reservation.
also,
around
that
same
time,
at
that
time
attorney
general
stone
issued
an
opinion
that
said
these
executive
order
lands
could
not
be
leased
under
the
1920
land
mineral
leasings
act
leased
federal
land
because
the
way
executive
order
reservations
were
set
up
was
that
the
president
would
set
out
a
parcel
of
land
for
a
group
of
indians
that
did
not
have
one
and
allow
them
to
stay
there.
then
in
1927,
after
much
debate,
consternation
by
the
states,
three
things
were
decided.
number
one,
the
indians
receive
their
land.
and
the
1927
act
specifically
says
that
they
get
their
executive
order
land
unless
congress
says
otherwise.
there
was
a
debate
about
whether
the
states
should
have
a
royalty
under
lands
or
whether
they
should
be
able
to
tax.
the
states
argued
that
the
land
should
be
leased
under
the
1920
act
in
which
case
they
would
receive
37
and
a
half
percent
royalty
just
like
they
did
under
the
federal
leases
at
that
time.
the
indian
tribes
didn't
believe
that.
and
finally,
in
1927
congress
struck
a
compromise
which
allowed
the
indians
to
have
their
lands
and
royalties,
but
allowed
the
states
to
go
ahead
and
impose
their
taxes
just
like
they
would
on
any
other
lands.
now,
in
1938
the
congress
passed
the
indian
mineral
leasing
act.
the
act
did
nothing
to
change
oil
and
gas
leasing.
it
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
any
changes
in
that
area,
but
primarily
dealt
with
changes
in
the
area
of
metalliferous
minerals.
there
is
no...
there
were
no
committee
hearings
at
that
time
regarding
the
act.
there
was
no
record,
quite
frankly,
except
for
a
letter
from
the
acting
secretary
of
interior
to
the
congress.
and
the
reasons
that
act
was
passed
was,
number
one,
to
make
sure
that
the
indians
had
the
authority
to
consent
to
the
mineral
leasing,
to
allow
oil...
or
not
oil
companies,
but
to
allow
mining
companies
when
they
came
on
to
the
leases
to
follow
the
one,
which
they
could
not
do.
and
it
specifically
followed
the
terms
of
the
1927
act
as
far
as
oil
and
gas
leasing
is
concerned.
and
the
repealer
clause
indicated
specifically
that
it
only
repealed
acts
that
were
inconsistent
with
it.
and
the
taxing
power
of
the
states
was
not
inconsistent.
one
final
point
on
the
history
of
that
act
was
that
just
two
months
prior
to
that
act,
this
court
decided
the
case
of
mountain
states...
or
excuse
me...
of
mountain
producers
v.
helvering
in
which
case
the
court
struck
down
the
governmental
immunity
doctrine
and
reversed
the
case
of
gillespie
v.
oklahoma
which
meant
at
that
time
the
case
this
court
felt
that
indian
tribes...
or
lessees
on
indian
tribe's
reservations
could,
in
fact,
be
taxed
under
state
law.
we
think
it
was
highly
unlikely
that
two
months
later
the
court
by
its
silence...
and
we
think
this
court
has
held
that
you
do
not
imply
immunity
by
silence...
that
this
court
would
have
repealed
somehow
by
implication
the
provisions
of
the
1927
act.
so--
mr.
harold
d.
stratton
--your
honor,
montana
against
blackfeet
is
not
inconsistent
with
my
argument
for
the
following
reasons.
in
that
particular
case,
the
state
of
montana
was
not
taxing
oil
company
interests;
the
state
of
montana
was
taxing
the
royalties
of
the
tribe.
when
the
court
decided
that
particular
case,
it
decided
it
using
two
canons
of
construction
which
were
unique
to
indian
tribes.
and
those
were
set
out
by
justice
powell
in
that
opinion,
and
they
were,
number
one,
that
you
construe
the
language...
or
first
of
all,
you
cannot
tax
any
indian
interests
without
specific
authorization
of
congress--
mr.
harold
d.
stratton
--yes,
your
honor,
it
did.
mr.
harold
d.
stratton
it
said
that
the
1938
act
was
the
act
under
which
those
particular
interests
were
leased,
but
that
the
1938
act
under
liberal
canons
of
construction
did
not
for
the
purposes
of
taxing
indian's
interests
incorporate
the
provisions
of
the
1927
act.
we
think
that...
we
believe
and
the
law
is
that
when
you
apply
the
law
to
other
citizens
that
you
don't
use
those
liberal
canons
of
construction.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
canons
of
construction,
when
it
comes
to
oil
companies
and
non-indian
citizens,
are
exactly
the
opposite,
and
that
had
the
court
in
that
case
been
looking
at
the
interest
of
the
oil
company--
mr.
harold
d.
stratton
--your
honor,
the
1938
act
said
nothing
about
taxation.
mr.
harold
d.
stratton
well,
the
blackfeet
case...
in
1985
this
court
held--
mr.
harold
d.
stratton
--it
held
that
the
'38
act
did
not
incorporate
the
'37
act
as
applied
to
indians'
interest.
it
did
not
hold,
for
instance,
that
that
act
was
repealed.
it
did
not
hold...
and
the
court
specifically
said
that
it
was
not
holding...
that
this
is
the
way
it
would
apply
to
non-indian
interests.
and
we
think
the
only
reason
the
court
held
that
way
in
that
particular
case
is
that
because
of
the...
and
the
court
said
this
right
in
the
case...
the
two
canons
of
construction
which
you
apply
when
you're
dealing
with
indian
tribes.
number
one,
you
have
to
expressly
tax...
the
congress
has
to
expressly
indicate
that
it's
going
to
allow
the
states
to
tax
indian
interests.
the
rule
is
just
the
opposite
when
it
comes
to
other
citizens.
and
number
two,
under
any
interpretation
of
statutes,
this
court
when
dealing
with
indians
uses
a
liberal
interpretation
to
the
benefit
of
the
indians.
and
we
think
that
those
are
not
the
canons
the
court
should
use
in
regard
to
other
citizens.
in
addition...
and
i
believe
i've
pretty
much
completed--
mr.
harold
d.
stratton
--your
honor,
the...
this
court
in
blackfeet
did
not
hold
it
was
repealed.
they
specifically
said
they
were
not
holding
that
it
was
repealed.
they
said
it
was
not
incorporated
into
the
1938
act
under
those
liberal
canons
of
construction.
so,
it's
still
on
the
books.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
those
acts
were
in
the
same
title
right
next
to
one
another,
396,
97
and
98
including
the
1924
act.
and
it
seems
to
me
obvious
that
if
congress
had
wanted
to
do
something,
they
would
have
expressly
repealed
the
taxing
authority,
particularly
after
the
long
battle
to
strike
that
compromise
in
1927
in
the
mountain
producers
holding.
in
addition
to
what
we
believe
is
congressional
intent
by
virtue
of
the
1927
act,
this
court...
or
excuse
me...
congress
in
1980
passes
the
crude
oil
windfall
profits
act,
and
that
act,
of
course...
for
tax...
and
that,
of
course,
taxed
the
windfall
profits
of
oil
companies.
in
that
particular
act,
congress
chose
to
exempt
the
royalties
received
by
indians
from
that
particular
windfall
tax,
but
they
chose
in
addition
not
to
exempt,
specifically
not
to
exempt,
the
interests
of
the
oil
companies.
so,
congress
at
that
time
felt
i
believe
that
there
was
enough
room
in
there
to
go
ahead
and
tax
the
interests
of
the
oil
companies,
and
it
did
not
hinder
its
policy
of
helping
and
allowing
the
indian
tribes
to
develop
their
resources.
mr.
harold
d.
stratton
your
honor,
i
think
you
do
not
have
to
take
it
into
account.
i
think
the
record
shows
that
it
did
not
burden
or
hinder
any
production
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
harold
d.
stratton
it
does
not,
your
honor.
and,
in
fact,
when
the...
when
cotton's
expert
witness,
mr.
wood,
was
testifying,
as
mr.
israel
previously
commented
to
the
court,
he
specifically
stated
that
a
reduction
of
taxes
would
do
no
more
for
production.
at
page
77
of
the
transcript,
when
he
went
on
to
testify
after
page
66
and
67,
he
specifically
said
under
cross-examination
that
the
lack
of
taxes
would
not
create
any
further
production,
that
there
were
other
economic
aspects
to
the
production
of
oil
and
gas
as
far
as
production
was
concerned.
and,
in
fact,
the
record
shows--
mr.
harold
d.
stratton
--your
honor,
i
suppose
that
is
correct.
i
can't
deny
that
you
obviously
want
to
make
as
high
as
a
profit
as
you
could.
however,
that
works
with
states
as
well.
you
would
certainly
rather
do
business
in
a
state
that
had,
had
a
lower
tax
rate.
if
you
were
doing...
if
you
were
operating
in
the
state
of
utah
or
some
other
state
that
had
county
taxes,
you'd
want
to
do
business
in
a
county
that
had
lower
taxes.
however,
in
this
particular
case,
the
record
is
clear
and
the
district
court
found
below
that
the
profits
are
sufficient
that
the
state
taxes
are
insufficient...
or
excuse
me...
are
insignificant
as
far
as
production
is
concerned
and
that
they
really
make
no
difference.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
evidence
of
that,
in
1977
there
were
1,353
producing
wells
on
the
jicarilla
reservation.
in
1985
there
was
2,224
wells.
cotton
in
its
testimony
by
mr.
wood,
their
division
production
manager
from
denver,
indicated,
notwithstanding
the
economic
conditions
nor
the
tax,
they
were
going
to
continue
to
drill,
were
drilling
12
new
wells
in
the
year
following
the
trial.
so,
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
and
the
court
found,
that
these
taxes
in
no
way
hindered
any
economic
development,
production
and
certainly
not
the
ability
of
the
tribe
to
raise
its
funds
as
well.
i'd
like
to
talk
a
little
bit
about
that
because
i
think
that
it's
important
to
note
that
the
tribe
is
not
affected
even
though
i
believe
congress
has
spoken,
that
the
tribe
is
absolutely
not
affected
by
this
particular
tax
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they're
doing
pretty
well
with
their
tax
as
they
should
be.
they
enacted
a
five
percent
tax
upon...
up
on
top
of
their
one
percent
severance
tax.
when
they
did
that,
they
have
realized
a
rather
significant
amount
of
money,
and
they're
continuing
to
do
that.
they
have
built
up
a
permanent
fund
of
$50
million
that
the
tribe
now
owns,
and
that
is
higher
per
capita,
per
jicarilla,
than
is
the
new
mexico
permanent
fund.
they
have
no
tribal
taxes
on
the
members.
they
have
a
tax-free
environment.
in
fact,
they
pay
each
jicarilla
member
out
of
their
royalties
and
out
of
their
taxes
each
year
$4,000
to
$5,000
to
supplement
their
income.
so,
i
think
that's
further
evidence
that
this
particular
tax
has
no
impact
on
the
ability
of
the
jicarillas
to
develop
their
own
resources.
i
want
to
talk
just
a
little
bit
about
the
disagreement
between
us
and
the
plaintiff
or
cotton
petroleum
as
far
as
the
benefits
that
new
mexico
confers.
there
have
been
a
couple
of
statements
in
this
court's
cases
that
indicate
that
the
states
have
no
more
responsibilities
as
far
as
indian
tribes
are
concerned.
the
record
indicates
here
that
the
jicarillas
spend
85
percent
of
their
money
off
the
reservation.
they
have
to
go
off
the
reservation
to
obtain
85
percent
of
their
services.
one
hundred
percent
of
jicarilla
children
attend
the
new
mexico
state
school,
the
state-funded
school,
public
school,
in
dulce,
new
mexico.
ninety
percent
of
the
enrollment--
mr.
harold
d.
stratton
--dulce.
d-u-l--
mr.
harold
d.
stratton
--d-u-l...
yes,
your
honor.
pronounced
dulce.
mr.
harold
d.
stratton
that
is
on
the
reservation.
mr.
harold
d.
stratton
there
are
some
discrepancies
in
the
record,
record,
your
honor,
but
according
to
the
1980
census,
there's
about
700...
1,750
tribal
members.
there's
slightly
less
than
2,000
people
according
to
the
census
living
on
the
reservation.
in
addition
to
the
schools,
the
state
of
new
mexico
maintains
four
state
roads
on
the
reservation
and
one
united
states
highway
on
the
reservation.
but
i
don't
want
to
minimize
the
fact
and
the
importance
of
all
of
the
roads
off
the
reservation.
when
these
jicarillas
and
other
members
living
on
the
reservation
are
going
places,
they
have
to
utilize
state
roads.
the
testimony
was
they
get
most
of
their
services
from
farmington,
albuquerque
and
santa
fe.
and
to
get
there,
they
have
to
use
state
roads.
and
each
jicarilla
apache
tribal
member
is
just
as
much
a
citizen
of
the
state
of
new
mexico
as
is
any
other
citizen.
they're
entitled
to
all
of
the
privileges,
immunities
and
services.
so,
to
distinguish
between
the
services
provided
by
the
state
as
to
whether
they're
provided
on
the
reservation
or
off
is
clearly
not
the
test.
they
attend
universities.
we
have
state-subsidized
universities.
in-state
students
have
an
ability
to
go
there,
and
have
their
tuition
reduced
because
they're
in-state.
jicarillas,
being
citizen
of
the
state,
benefit
from
that.
we
have
police
protection,
and
we
have
cross-deputization
with
the
jicarillas
as
well.
we
have
a
court
system
to
which
all
of
its
citizens,
including
the
jicarillas
and
cotton,
are
allowed
to
participate
or
allowed
to
utilize.
and
finally,
they're
entitled
to
all
of
the
health
care
benefits
that
is
provided
by
the
state
of
new
mexico
to
all
of
its
citizens.
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
commerce
clause,
if
i
might,
just
briefly
and
talk
about
it.
there
is
one
thing
with
which
we
and
the
indian
amici
are
in
unanimity
on
and
that
is
whether
indian
tribes
or
indian
reservations
should
be
treated
as
states.
i
have
a
hard
time
coming
up
here
and
conceptualizing
how
that
would
actually
work.
we
are
concentric
sovereigns.
reservations
vary
widely.
there
are
different
numbers
of
tribal
members
on
one
reservation
as
on
other
reservations,
and
they
are
technically
concentric
sovereigns.
indians
have
citizenship,
they
vote,
they
hold
office.
the
land
occupied
by
the
jicarilla
reservation
is
a
part
of
new
mexico.
how
we
treat
the
tribe
as
a
reservation...
250
tribes...
or
how
we
treat
the
tribe
as
a
state
with
250
of
them
around
the
country,
puzzles
me
as
to
how
we
would
deal
with
it.
in
fact,
i
think
the
u.s.
constitution
treats
them
separately.
this
court,
mr.
chief
justice
has
repeatedly
held
as
recently
as
the
ramah
case
that
they
are
not
states
and
that
they
are
not
going
to
be
treated
as
states.
as
far
as
apportionment
is
concerned,
the...
cotton
has
suggested
an
apportionment
formula
whereby
you
apportion
the
tax
based
on
the
benefits
received
by
the
taxpayers.
that
particular
doctrine
or
theory
has
been
rejected
as
far
back
as
thomas
v.
gay
by
this
court,
and
we
see
no
reason
or
no
way
that
can
happen.
taxes
are
not
an
assessment
of
benefits.
taxes
are
a
way
of
apportioning
the
benefits
of
living
in
an
organized
society
to
various
members.
i'd
like
to
say
just
one
last
thing
at
this
point
and
that
is
that
this
particular
case
is
a
case
brought
by
one
oil
company
against
a
state
involving
one
reservation.
we
have
26
indian
reservation
in
the
state
of
new
mexico.
there
are
over
250
different
reservations
across
the
country.
they
are
all
different.
many
of
them
do
not
produce
resources.
some
of
them
do.
some
have
fee
land
in
them.
a
lot
of
non-members
live
in
them--
mr.
harold
d.
stratton
--your
honor,
i'm
sorry.
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
harold
d.
stratton
your
honor,
i'm
sorry.
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that.
it
is
not
going
down
in
the
state
of
new
mexico.
i
do
not
know
what's
happening
in
the
rest
of
the
country.
mr.
harold
d.
stratton
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
d.
stratton
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
harold
d.
stratton
well,
your
honor,
i
do
not
emphasize
how
big
the
indian
population
is,
but
rather
the
fact
that
there
are
250
separate
independent
sovereign
nations,
and
they
all
have
different
governmental
aspects
to
them
just
like
many
other
different
nations
do.
and
to
apply
blanket
rules,
such
as
the
one
that
is
proposed
by
cotton
in
this
particular
case,
may
very
well
do
more
harm
to
those
reservations,
particularly
the
ones
in
utah,
as
the
amici
of
the
counties
indicate,
than
help.
mr.
harold
d.
stratton
your
honor,
i
think
the...
upholding
this
tax
will,
in
fact,
help
the
indians
because
the
indians
are
citizens
of
our
state
just
like
they
are
citizens
of
the
other
states
that
they
live
in,
and
it
will
allow
cotton
to
participate
in
providing
the
benefits
of
an
organized
society
not
only
to
themselves
and
the
employees
of
cotton,
but
also
to
the
jicarillas
and
other
indian
people
in
our
state.
mr.
harold
d.
stratton
they...
the
leases
indicate
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
they
were
executed
under
the
1938
indian
mineral
leasing
act.
mr.
harold
d.
stratton
yes,
your
honor.
the
act
does
have
something
to
do
with
oil
and
gas
leases.
the,
the
point
i
wanted
to
make
is
that
when
that
act
was
enacted,
it
was
not
for
the
purpose
of
providing
oil
and
gas
terms.
they
are
almost
identical,
and
they
are
effectively
identical
with
the
terms
of
the
1927
act.
that
act
was
primarily
enacted
to
deal
with
metalliferous
minerals
as
opposed
to
oil
and
gas,
but
it
does
include
leasing
provisions
for
oil
and
gas.
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
i'll
waive
the
rest
of
my
time.
