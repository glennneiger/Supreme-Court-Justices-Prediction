normally,
normally
when
you
rely
on
a
preemption
argument,
don't
you
look
for
something
congress
said
to
support
the
notion
congress
intended
preemption?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
off
the
reservation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
on?
how
many
member
of
the
tribe
are
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
emphasize
the
14
percent,
but
supposing
you
had
a
case
in
which
the
tribe
didn't
impose
any
taxes
of
its
own.
it
got
all
its
income
in
the
form
of
royalties.
it
just
negotiated
a
different
arrangement.
would
the
state
tax
still
be
equally
preempted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
really
the
14
percent
isn't
relevant
to
the
legal
analysis,
i
don't
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
from
its
vantage
point,
it
would
be
exactly
the
same
if
it
had
negotiated
a
more
favorable
lease
instead
of
added
on
top
of
it
this...
this
tax.
justice
john
paul
stevens
when...
when
were
these
leases
signed
again?
i
can't--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
they
started
taxing
them
when?
the
tribe
started
taxing
them
when?
justice
john

seven
years
ago
in
mary
anne
against
the
hickorel
apache
tribe,
we
held
that
the
tribe
has
the
power
to
impose
a
severance
tax
on
the
production
of
oil
and
gas
by
non-indian
lessees
of
oils
located
on
the
tribe's
reservation.
today,
in
an
appeal
form
the
new
mexico
court
of
appeals,
we
hold
that
the
state
of
new
mexico
may
also
impose
a
severance
tax
on
the
same
production
of
oil
and
gas.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
conclude
that
the
indian
mineral
leasing
act
of
1938,
which
grants
the
tribe
authority
to
execute
mineral
leases
does
not
include
an
express
or
implied
prohibition
on
state
taxation
of
the
non-indian
lessees.
nor
are
we
able
to
find
such
a
prohibition
in
any
other
congressional
enactment
or
in
the
now
repudiated
doctrine
of
intergovernmental
tax
immunity.
we
also
reject
cotton's
contention
that
the
state
severance
tax
is
inconsistent
with
the
commerce
clause
because
the
aggregation
of
state
and
indian
taxes
imposes
a
higher
burden
of
on-reservation
production
than
on
other
production
in
the
state.
most
significantly,
there
is
simply
no
basis
for
concluding
that
indian
tribes
which
are
separately
mentioned
in
the
commerce
clause
should
be
treated
as
states
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
the
judgment
of
the
new
mexico
court
of
appeals
is
therefore,
affirmed.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
brennan
and
marshall
have
joined.
