mr.
daniel
h.
israel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
begin
my
argument
by
just
briefly
summarizing
it
in
outline
form.
first,
cotton
petroleum
as
a
result
of
its
decision
to
be
a
business
partner
of
the
jicarilla
tribe
pays
a
75
percent
penalty
in
terms
of
severance
and
production
taxes
by
producing
trust
minerals
on
the
reservation
vis-a-vis
what
its
competitors
do
off
the
reservation.
secondly,
we
believe
this
court's
preemption
and
commerce
clause
cases
fully
support
our
claim.
third,
we
believe
the
court
should
in
this
decision
give
the
same
message
it
has
been
giving
for
25
years
since
warren
trading
post,
and
that
message
is
to
the
tribes,
go
ahead,
tribes.
continue
to
develop
the
small
economies
on
your
reservation.
continue
to
provide
employment.
continue
to
develop
your
own
powers
of
tribal
self-government,
to
educate
your
children,
et
cetera.
and
to
the
states,
look,
states,
stop
taxing
the
reservations
as
if
they
did
not
exist.
stop
taxing
the
economies
on
those
reservations
as
if
there
were
no
federal
presence
and
no
tribal
government.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
that's
their
finding.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
i
don't
think
you
should
because
i
think
the
record
contradicts
the
finding
of
the
new
mexico
court.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
well,
i
think
the
court
has
the
record
to
consider
side
by
side
with
the
court
of
appeals'
finding.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
yes,
your
honor.
the
fact
is
that
in
our
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
we
challenged
many
of
the
district
court
findings.
and
the
court
of
appeals
never
reached
those
challenges
on
our
part.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
no,
your
honor.
the
record
indicates
as
follows:
that
cotton
as
a
result
of
these
taxes
has
limited
its
production
to
in-field
well
production
only.
and
that
means
that
on
a
15,000
acre
lease
that
there
are
substantial
oil
and
gas
reserves
left
in
the
ground
because
of
that
decision
by
cotton
to...
to
limit
its
development
to
only
in-field
wells.
and
the
transcript
at
67,
68,
unrebutted,
indicates,
justice
o'connor,
that
that
decision
was
partly
motivated
by
these
taxes.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
yes,
that's
true.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
well--
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
--that's
true.
the
fact
is
that
there
was
no
contrary
evidence.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
well--
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
--well,
the
tribal
chairman--
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
--yes.
the
tribal
chairman
testified
in
the
trial.
he
focused
on...
that
the
imbalance
between
the
substantial
taxes
imposed
by
new
mexico
and
the
lack
of
services.
and
he
said
if
you're
going
to
tax
at
this
level,
let's
have
some
significantly
greater
services.
the
amicus
brief
of
the
jicarilla
tribe--
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
--well,
the
amicus
brief
of
the
tribe
say
it
has
a
chilling
effect.
it
said
that
because
of
these
overlapping
taxes...
this
is
page
1
and
page
2
of
the
amicus
brief.
it
said
we
are
having...
it's
complicating
and
making
more
difficult
new...
new
oil
and
gas
deals.
it
also
says
on
page
2
that
it's...
it's
taking
away
from
the
attractiveness
of
oil
and
gas
deals
on
the
reservation,
and
it's
increasing
the
expenses
of
doing
business
for...
not
only
for
present
operators
of
the
tribe,
but
future
operators.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
no.
and
there's
a
suggestion
by
the
new
mexico
brief.
it
is
simply
incorrect.
and
i
think
your
question,
justice
o'connor,
is
very
relevant.
in
1982
congress
enacted
this
joint
venture
statute,
and
under
that
statute
tribes
can
now
negotiate
deals
whereas
traditionally
they
had
lease
arrangements.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
the
fact
of
the
matter
is...
and
we
cited
it
in
our
reply
brief
on
page
13...
that
in
considering...
and
that's
house
report
736...
in
considering
the
mineral
leasing
act
of
1982,
congress
rejected
the
notion
of
a
express
authorization
for
state
taxation.
and
congress
said,
no,
we
are
going
to
stick
with
the
balancing
test
that
the
court
has
been
utilizing,
and
congress
expressly
referenced
crow
tribe
v.
montana.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
u.s.
code
administrative
news.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
xxx.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
this
is
the
1982
mineral
leasing
act.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
yes.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
no,
it's
in
the
house
report,
736.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
no.
what
i...
well,
justice,
what
i'm
suggesting
in
trying
to
answer
justice
o'connor's
question
is--
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
--in
the
mineral
development
act,
it
simply
authorized
the
tribes
to
develop
joint
ventures.
it
said
nothing
about
taxation.
it
indicated
in
a
house
report
that
it
was
staying
with
the...
with
this
court's
balancing
test,
and
they
expressly
referenced
crow
tribe
v.
montana.
and,
therefore,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
there
is
no
express
barrier
from
taxation
in
that
1982
act
and,
of
course,
there's
no
express
invitation
to
tax.
so,
in
that
respect
it's
identical
with
the
1938
act.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
i
don't
see
that
there's
any
difference.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
if
it's...
if
it's
tribally
owned
production,
if
it's
a
100
percent
tribal
operation,
clearly
the
ability
to
resist
state
taxation
is
stronger.
under
mcclanahan,
under
a
long
tradition,
there's
a
complete
barrier
to
state
taxation
of
the
indian
interest.
but
the
partnership
arrangement
in
these
leases
is
no
different
than
the
partnership
arrangement
in
a
joint
venture.
the
fact
is
that
if
taxation
is
not
justified
under
either
commerce
clause
doctrine
or
the
preemption
doctrine,
that...
that
state
taxation
reduces
the
profitability
of
the
operation.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
yes,
the
1982
act.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
no.
no,
i
think...
i
think
tribes
typically
are
utilizing
that
vehicle
although
some
of
them
continue
to
use
the
1938
act
because
if
you'll
note
in
the
1938
act,
there's
an
option.
you
can
negotiate
a
lease
as
well
as
have
a
bid
and
lease.
and
the
answer
is
they're
using
both,
but
the
tax
issue
is
the
same
in
both.
and
this
case
would
not
be
any
different
if,
if
it
involved
198...
'82
joint
ventures
rather
than
1938
act
leases.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
yes.
i
just...
maybe
i'm
not...
i'm
not
trying
to
be
difficult.
i
just
don't
see
that
in
terms
of
resisting
state
taxation,
that
it
matters
whether
it's
a
joint
venture
or
a
lease.
they
have
common
characteristics.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
well,
chief
justice,
if
as
a
result
of
a
joint
venture
agreement
you
had
a
100
percent
indian-owned
operation,
i
think
i
have
a
easier
case
today.
i
would
say
that
this...
this
case
is
very
similar
to
bracker.
bracker...
you
had
a...
you
had
a
joint
venture
through
a
lease
arrangement
with
a...
with
a
non-indian
company
and
the
white
mountain
apache
tribe
case.
the
fact
that
you
had
a
non-indian
taxpayer
there
didn't
prevent
this
court
from
saying
to
arizona
you
cannot
tax.
and,
in
fact,
we
have
a
stronger
cases
because
the
comprehensive
federal
regulatory
scheme
here
covers
the
very
act
that's
being
taxed.
here
our
regulations
cover
the
severance
activity.
new
mexico
is
taxing
the
severance
activity.
in
bracker
and
in
ramah,
the
state
was
taxing
an
activity
that
was
not
the
subject
of
federal
regulation,
and
that
bothered
several
members
of
this
court.
in
bracker,
the
tax
being
imposed
by
arizona
was
a
fuel
use
tax
and
a
license
tax
on
the
trucks,
and
there
was
no
federal
regulation
dealing
with
trucking.
the
federal
regulations
there
deal
with
timber.
and
in
ramah...
again,
this
caused
quite
concern
on
the
court...
the
federal
regulations
there
dealt
with
trying
to
encourage
indians
to
build
schools
on
the
reservation,
and
the
regulations
dealt
with
encouraging
financing.
they
didn't
deal
with
construction,
but
new
mexico
was
trying
to
impose
tax
on
the
construction
of
a
school.
and
yet,
in
a
divided
opinion,
the
court
sustained
the,
the
effort
of
the
contractor
to
resist
state
taxation.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
well,
that's...
that's
kind
of
the
state's
attempt
we
think
to
change
the
rules
and
kind
of
revisit
blackfeet.
our
answer
is
that
we
think
blackfeet
represents
a
fair
and
sensible
compromise.
the
1924
and
1927
acts
were
enacted
by
a
congress
that
was
bent
on
assimilating
the
indians,
getting
rid
of
the
reservation.
that
was
all
pre-fdr
indian
reorganization
act.
and
what
this
court
said
in
blackfeet
is
we
will
allow
those
old
statutes
which
have
relatively
little
production
today
to
be
taxable.
but
for
the
new
era,
the
mineral
leasing
act,
which
is
1938,
four
years
after
the
indian
reorganization
act,
expressly
designed
to
harmonize
with
the
indian
reorganization
act,
we're
not
going
to
read
into
that
1938
act
a
power
to
tax
because
congress
didn't
read
it
in.
and
i,
i
might
add,
for
example,
congress--
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
--that's
clear.
but,
but,
justice
white,
congress...
for
example,
when
it
comes
to
federal
production
today,
in
30
u.s.c.
189,
congress
expressly
authorizes
state
taxation.
so,
congress
has,
has
been
very
actively
involved
in
this
whole
area.
it's
not
as
if
we
have
to
rely
strictly
on
this
court's
teachings
or
congress'
from
years
ago.
the
fact
is
when
it
comes
to
federal
production,
there's
an
express
authorization
permitting
state
taxation.
when
it
comes
to
indian
production,
after
the
indian
reorganization
act,
there
is
no
express
authorization.
and
this
court
found,
again
in
a
divided
opinion--
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
--federal
oil
and
gas
production,
enormous
amounts
of
federal
oil
and
gas
production.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
federal
lands,
yes,
justice
scalia.
and
there
the
states
can
tax
because
congress
has
given
them
an
express
mandate,
30
u.s.c.
189.
now--
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i,
i
guess
i
would,
would
resist
that
a
little
bit
because
the...
there
is
no...
there
is
no
equivalent
of
an
indian
reorganization
act
for
federal
lands.
there's
no
policy
on
federal
lands
to,
to
strengthen
the
federal
government's,
you
know,
local
powers
in...
in
wyoming
or
colorado,
but
there
is
a
federal
mandate
to
strengthen
the
powers
of
the
tribes
and
the
reservations
in
those
states.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
well,
that...
that's
the...
that
is
years
ago,
and
then
during
the...
the
'30s
the
breakdown
of
that
intergovernmental
immunity
began
in
this
court's
decisions.
and
that
intergovernmental
immunity
has
been
reduced
so
that
the
answer
is
that
taxation
of
federal
oil
and
gas,
for
example,
has
gone
on
since
the
'30s.
but
my
point
is
even,
even
in
the...
in
the
presence
of
a
reduced
intergovernmental
immunity,
congress
has
played
a
role
here,
and
congress
has
said,
yes,
there
shall
be
taxation
of
federal
production.
but
congress
hasn't
said
that
in
the
indian
area
and--
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
--yes,
and
i
think...
i
think...
new
mexico
complains
that
the
preemption
teachings
of
this
court
in
the
indian
area
are
kind
of...
are
asked
with
preemption
elsewhere,
and
i
think
in
our
reply
brief
we
pointed
out
that
there
are
certain
areas
of
the
law,
admiralty,
sedition,
and
in
the
foreign
areas
where
the
court...
including
the
indian
area,
where
the
court
has
said
this
is
presumably
and
presumptively
a
subject
of
federal
concern
and,
therefore,
the
test
for
preemption
is
somewhat
different.
and,
therefore,
in
the
indian
case,
for
example...
and
this
is...
we
have
found
this
through
warren
trading
post.
we've
seen
this
in
bracker.
we've
seen
this
in
mescalero
hunting
and
fishing...
the
notion
is
if
there'
going
to
be
state
tax
or
a
state
regulation...
and
the
court
unanimously
said
this
in
mescalero...
there's
a
burden
because
there's
a
responsibility
and
a
service
being
provided
by
the
state.
so,
the
preemption
doctrine
has
emerged
in
this
area
recognizing
the
significant
federal
interests
here
on
the
reservation
vis-a-vis,
as
the
court
said
last
term
in
cabazon,
the
minimal
state
interest
of
taxation.
now,
in
our
supplemental
brief...
and
i
think
this
is
very
important...
this
court
decided
the
cabazon
case.
and
that
dealt
with
a...
a
reservation
economic
activity
of,
of
gambling,
gaming,
hardly...
hardly
akin
to
oil
and
gas
reserves
which
are
non-renewable
resources,
which
on
the
jicarilla
reservation
and
many
reservations
is
their...
is
the
main
economic
hope.
but
even
in
the
context
of
gaming,
the
court
upheld
the
position
of
the
tribes
that
state
laws
should
not
apply.
and
what
did
congress
do?
congress
passed
the
indian
gaming
regulatory
act
of
1988
just
six
weeks
ago,
and
in
that...
and
in
that
legislation,
which
i
pointed
out
in
the
supplemental
brief,
the
court
again...
excuse
me...
congress
once
again
said
we're
staying
with
the
teachings
of
this
court.
states
cannot
tax
except
in
the
article
3
gaming
area.
they
said
if
the
states,
as
a
result
of
negotiation
with
the
tribes,
can
demonstrate
specific
responsibility
here,
we
will
allow
the
states
to
have
a
cost
reimbursement.
so,
i
think
congress
knows
what's
going
on
and
congress
believes
that
the
balancing
test
that
this
court
has
adopted
for
25
years
now
represents
a
fair
resolution
of
these
issues.
and
again--
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
--absolutely.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
if,
if
the
world
stopped
in
1928,
i
would
absolutely
agree
with
you
and
we
wouldn't
be
here
because
we
wouldn't
be
wasting
our
time.
nineteen
twenty-four
and
nineteen
twenty-seven...
it's
a
three-year
period.
there
were
two
acts
of
congress.
but
that
was
during
the
allotment
era.
that
was
when
the
indians
were
dying,
and
the
allotments
had
taken
the
millions
of
acres
of
reservations
in
the
west
and
put
them
into
allotments
and
seeing
those
allotments...
because
every
time
an
indian
received
an
allotment,
he
didn't
pay
his
property
taxes.
there
was
a
foreclosure,
and
there
was
a
loss
of
land.
and
that's
the
way
congress
was
going.
but
in
1934
it
all
changed.
now,
we
think
we
have
a
stronger
case
than...
than
bracker,
getting
back
to
bracker,
simply
because
our
regulations
control
the
activity
being
taxed.
and
in
bracker,
this
court
found
that
there
was
a
chilling
effect
on
the
timber
industry
even
in
the
face
of
a
minor
$34,000
tax.
there
were
three
findings
in
bracker
by
the
court:
one,
that
the
federal
statutory
scheme
designed
to
maximize
profits
from
timber
was
being
interfered
with;
two,
that
the
tribe
and
future
contractors
were
simply
were
in
a
less
attractive
economic
environment
and
therefore
there
would
be
a
chilling
effect
on,
on
timber
activity;
and
three,
the
state
tax
also
deprived
the
tribe
and
its
business
partner
of
money,
expense
money,
if
you
will,
to
comply
with
a
comprehensive
scheme.
now,
in
our
brief,
we
have
gone
on
with,
you
know,
pages
of
federal
regulations,
and
the
jicarilla
brief
also
has
several
pages
of
tribal
ordinances.
it's
an
expensive
proposition
doing
business
on
the
reservations.
cotton
now
has
three
masters:
the
state,
the
tribe,
the
federal
government.
we
don't
think
we...
by
doing
business
on
the
reservation,
we
should
be
burdened
that
way.
it
doesn't
seem
fair
to
us
and
it
doesn't
seem
necessary.
now,
i
would
like
to
turn
for
a
minute,
moving
away
from
bracker
to
the
mineral
leasing
act.
we
focused
for
a
minute
on
the
traditional
view,
the
traditional
context
of
that
act.
i
just
want
to
remind
the
court
that
in
crow
tribe
v.
montana,
the
court
in
a
summary
affirmance
saw
that
act
as
being
preemptive
and
struck
down
off-reservation
taxes
in
montana.
we're
talking
about
on-reservation
here.
and
this
court
also
in
kerr-mcgee
v.
navajo
nation
described
that
statute
as
a
comprehensive
statute
and
recognized
that
it
was
critical
to
many
rural
reservations.
any
hope
of
having
a
future
homeland
would
be
the
extraction
of
those
mineral
resources
in
a,
in
a
fair
and
balanced
environment.
and
we
don't
think
multiple
taxation
is
a
fair
and
balanced
environment.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
well,
i
think
for
purposes...
i
think--
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
--in
a
broad
sense,
no,
you
have
not.
and
turning
to
the--
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
--in
the
commerce
clause
question
that
we...
i
have
raised
and
the
court
has
asked
me
to
consider,
in
a
limited
sense
only,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
say,
yes,
states
should
be
treated...
tribes
should
be
treated
as
states
in
a
limited
sense
only.
now,
congress
understands
that.
for
example,
in
recent
amendments
to
the
internal
revenue
code,
the
tax
status
act,
the
tribes
now
can
issue
tax-free
bonds
for
purposes
of
capital
improvement
on
the
reservation.
congress
has
no
problem
with
treating
tribe
as
states
for
limited
purposes.
all
we
are
saying
is
under
the
commerce
clause,
the
court
has
traditionally
understood
the
purpose
of
the
commerce
clause
was
to
preserve
a
common
market
and
that
over
the
years
the
threat
to
that
common
market,
the
impediment,
if
you
will,
has
been
parochial
taxation
by
the
states.
multiple
taxation
is
a
typical
example
or
discriminatory
taxation.
what's
novel
in
this
case,
the
court
is
being
asked
for
the
first
time
to
consider
whether
that
common
market...
the
preservation
of
that
common
market
would
be
threatened
by
multiple
taxation
by
a
tribe
and
a
state.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
so,
in
the
limited
sense
of
whether
there's
a,
a
discrimination
on
interstate
commerce,
whether
there's
an
economic
impact
that's,
that's
unfair
and
not
justified,
we
say
it
is
appropriate
to
treat
a
tribe
as
a
state
for
that
limited
purpose
only.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
well,
mr.
justice
scalia,
i
think
there's
teachings
in...
in
this
court's
recent
case
law
that
supports
our
view:
commonwealth
edison
and
jicarilla
tribe
v.
merrion.
both
times
the
court
said
the
act
of
severance
of
minerals
is
a
local
act,
and
we
are
going
to
allocate
under
the
commerce
clause
to
the
local
government
the
power
to
tax
that
local
act.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
well,
and
i
think
that's
fair
to
say.
in
merrion,
on
one
hand,
the
court
said
we're
going
to
allocate
this,
and
you...
and
you
did.
we're
going
to
allocate
this
to
the
tribe,
but
then
the
court
dropped
a
footnote
26
saying,
well,
if...
if
you've
got
problems
with
multiple
taxation,
go
after
the
state,
and
that's
what
we
have
done.
so,
our
view
is
that
the
preferred
result
is
an
allocation
of
that
power
to
the
tribe
where
you
have
trust
resources.
if
you've
got
fee
oil
and
gas
within
a
reservation,
for
example,
we
would
think
some
allocation
might
be
appropriate.
we've...
we've
also
offered
the
idea
of
a
credit
perhaps
as
a
way
of
recognizing
the
primary
power
of
the
tribe
and
yet
providing
the
state
with
some
tax
revenues
in
those
limited
situations
where
there
is
a
specific
state
interest.
so,
allocation
and
apportionment
are
both
available.
we
think
in
this
case
allocation
is
the
proper
way
of
resolving
it.
and
the
court
could
consider
the
idea
of
a
credit.
it
had
rejected
the
credit
in
the
colville
case,
properly
so
because
the
court
pointed
out
in
colville
that
the
only
indian
commerce
you
had
there
was
an
exemption.
you're
bringing
a
cigarette
tax
exemption
on
the
reservation.
a
credit
wouldn't
preserve
that
exemption,
and
therefore
it
was
rejected.
i
think
i'll
reserve
my
last
five
minutes.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
is
a
claim
for
refund.
this
particular
case
will
result,
if
we
are
successful,
in
some
portion
of
the
new
mexico
taxes
being
refunded.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
the
impact
on
the
tribe
is
not,
so
much
in
this
particular
refund
action,
but
really
the
larger
question
as
the
court
has
recognized
in
bracker,
in
ramah,
in
mescalero,
and
as
the
tribe
itself
indicates
in
its
amicus
brief,
the
larger
question
is
its
ability
to
make
the
reservation
attractive,
to
eliminate
this
penalty.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
i
didn't
say
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
no,
it
is
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
yes.
we
said...
and
the
next
sentence
makes
it
clearer.
we
said
that
when
you
have
a
commerce
clause
inquiry,
you
look
at
the
controlling
acts
of
congress,
congress
to
see
if
there
are
any...
if
you
see...
to
see
if
there
are
any,
and
then
you
look
to
the
commerce
clause.
we
said
the
preemption
concept
was
a
background
here.
so,
we
didn't...
we
didn't
say
it
wasn't
a
preemption
case.
we
said
the
preemption
issues
were
a
part
and
parcel
of
the
commerce
clause
issues.
now,
i
would
like
to
rebut
several,
several
points.
first
of
all,
the
indian
tribes...
some
of
them
are
doing
better
today
than
they
have
been,
and
it's
partly
because
of
congressional
support
and
because
of
decisions
of
this
court.
the
jicarillas
have
more
oil
and
gas
reserves
than
most
reservations,
but
let's...
let's
not...
let's
not
new
mexico
overstate
the
case.
the
record
here
indicates
in
transcript
514
that
the
average
per...
per
capita
income
of
these
indians
is
less
than
the
per
capita
income
of
new
mexico
citizens,
let
alone
the
per
capita
income
of
the
rest
of
the
citizens
of
the
united
states.
and
i
think
that's
important.
the
second
point
is,
yes,
new
mexico
is
the
provider
of
a
civilized
society
off
the
reservation,
and
the
record
indicates
that
the
indians
here,
cotton,
its
employees,
its
contractors,
when
they're
off
the
reservation,
they
pay
all
of
those
taxes.
and
the
court
has
indicated
in
ramah
that...
that
off-reservation
benefits
and
services
simply
don't
answer
the
question
about
what
happens
on
the
reservation.
and
we
think
the
record
here
indicates
there
is
a
deterrence
of
production.
the
tribe
has
indicated
there's
a
chilling
effect
on
terms
of
now
it
may
develop
resources
in...
in
the
future.
and
justice
o'connor
i
think
makes
it
apparently
clear
that
if
you
have
a
14
percent
of
value
tax
burden
on
the
reservation,
inevitably
that's
less
attractive
than
off
the
reservation.
so,
in
bracker,
in
ramah,
in
mescalero,
in
cabazon,
these
are
cases
where
much
smaller
intrusions,
much
smaller
levels
of
taxes
were
kept
off
the
reservation
than
here,
and
we
would...
we
would
say
that
those
teachings
suggest
that
when
you
have
significant
taxes
here
that
aren't
justified,
that
they
should
be
kept
off
the
reservation
too.
the
tribes
are
developing
more
significant
governmental
services.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
yes.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
well,
it
gives
rise
to
a
commerce
clause
claim,
that
if
you
didn't
have
the
taxes,
then
you
have
only
a
controlling
acts
of
congress,
a
preemption
claim.
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
tribe
trying
to
develop
a
stronger
economic
base
for
its
members,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it,
it
draws
revenues
from
a
nonrenewable
trust
resource
from
royalties,
rents
or
from
taxes.
from
its
vantage
point,
it
doesn't
matter.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
and
that's
what
the
tribe
has
said
here.
with
these
taxes
it,
it
gets
less
money
because
the
companies
that
go
to
the
tribe
now,
now
and
put
together
a
joint
venture
say,
well,
let's
see.
we've
got
to
pay
all
these
taxes
to
the
state,
plus
we've
got
to
pay
your
taxes,
so
you
get
less
rent.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
these
were
early
leases
in
the
1950s.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
in
the
1970s.
mr.
daniel
h.
israel
now,
the
final
thing
i'd
like
to
say
about
the
effort
to
revisit
blackfeet...
and
it's
a
little
troublesome
to
the
court
because
the
1924
and
1927
acts...
they
authorized
taxation
of
the
indian
share
as
well
as
the,
the
producer
share.
so,
it
the
court
were
to
reverse
itself
in
blackfeet,
then
it
seems
to
me
it's
stuck
with
a...
a
rather
anomalous
situation
of
saying
in
this
most
important
area
of
all
for
indian
economies,
congress
has
spoken
and
taxation
can
apply
to...
across
the
board,
to
indian
tribes
as
well
as
producers.
and
so,
we
would
urge
the
court
not
to
go
backwards,
not
to
upset
what
we
think
has
been
a
consistent
25-year
line
of
cases
ever
since
warren
trading
post
that
says
taxes
are
a
burden
on
indian
commerce,
and
they
can
only
be
justified
by
a
specific
showing
of
state
responsibility
and
state
services.
and
that's
what
congress
now
agrees
to.
as
i
said,
in
the
mineral
leasing
act,
in
the
gaming
act,
they
support
the
court's
findings.
