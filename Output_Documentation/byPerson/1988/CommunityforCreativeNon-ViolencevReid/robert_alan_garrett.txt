mr.
robert
alan
garrett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case,
your
honors,
involves
a
dispute
over
who
has
the
rights,
under
the
1976
copyright
act,
to
authorize
reproductions
of
a
statue
entitled
"third
world
america".
the
community
for
creative
non-violence,
which
is
a
homeless
activist
organization
located
here
in
washington,
originally
had
third
world
america
produced
in
order
to
serve
as
a
symbol
of
the
cause
that
they
espouse
and
to
help
raise
national
consciousness
about
the
plight
of
the
homeless
here
in
america.
consistent
with
that
purpose,
we
would
like
to
be
able
to
disseminate
as
widely
as
possible
throughout
the
united
states
reproductions
of
third
world
america
in
the
form
of
christmas
cards,
posters,
and
other
media,
and
then
to
apply
whatever
revenues
are
generated
by
those
reproductions
to
help
fund
the
work
that
we
do
with
the
homeless.
mr.
reid,
however,
says
that
we
cannot
do
so
without
negotiating
his
permission.
mr.
reid
claims
that
he
and
he
alone
has
the
right
to
authorize
reproductions
of
third
world
america
and
to
profit...
and
to
derive
any
of
the
profits
that
are
associated
with
those
reproductions.
now,
there's
no
written
agreement
in
this
case
between
reid
and
ccnv.
we
basically
had
a
handshake
agreement.
ccnv,
which
depends
upon
volunteers
to
perform
all
of
its
services,
asked
mr.
reid
to
donate
his
services
to
sculpt
figures
in
third
world
america.
mr.
reid
agreed
to
do
so,
saying
that
he
too
was
concerned
about
the
homeless.
and
believing
that
all
parties
here
were
pursuing
a
common
objective,
we
then
proceeded
to
pay
mr.
reid
$15,000
to
cover
his
expenses,
such
as
the
rent
on
his
studio,
the
various
utilities,
bills,
the
cost
of
his
assistants,
and
the
materials.
after
the
project
was
completed,
after
we
had
paid
mr.
reid
the
$15,000,
and
after
we
had
given
him
the
experience
that
we
had
of
years
of
dealing
with
the
homeless
and
our
creative
direction
in
sculpting
the
statue,
mr.
reid
told
us
for
the
first
time
that
his
concerns
for
the
homeless
did
not
extend
so
far
as
to
relinquishing
his
claim
to
what
he
considers
to
be
the
very
valuable
reproduction
rights
in
third
world
america.
believing
that
this
was
inconsistent
with
the
spirit
of
the
arrangement
that
we
had
worked
out
with
mr.
reid
to
begin
with,
and
believing
that
any
revenues
that
should
be
derived
from
third
world
america
should
go
to
the
benefit
of
the
homeless
and
not
to
the
benefit
of
any
single
individual,
we
filed
this
litigation.
the
issue
before
the
court--
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
--we
will--
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
--we
will
in
fact
use
it--
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
--we
will
in
fact
use
the
revenues
that
are
derived
from
this,
your
honor,
to
benefit
the
homeless,
to
help
fund
the
various
programs
that--
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
our
only
purpose,
your
honor,
is
to
serve
the
homeless.
the
only
programs
that
we
run
are
for
the
homeless.
there
is
no
other
place
that
we
will
use
the--
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
the
legal
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
during
that
seven-week
period
that
mr.
reid
worked
full-time
on
the
third
world
america
project
he
and
ccnv
had
an
employment
relationship
within
the
meaning
of
the
work-for-hire
provisions
of
the
1976
copyright
act.
in
resolving
this
issue,
the
court
will
effectively
establish
guidelines
for
determining
the
circumstances
under
which
one
who
hires
an
artist
to
produce
a
work
will
be
the
copyright
owner
of
that
work
absent
a
written
agreement
to
the
contrary.
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
from
various
amici
briefs
that
have
been
filed
in
this
case
it
is
clear
that
the
issue
to
be
decided
here
has
ramifications
well
beyond
our
organization
and
extends
generally
throughout
the
entire
copyright
community.
after
our
two-day
bench
trial,
the
district
court
found
that
we
had
the
right
to
artistic
control
of
the
production
of
third
world
america.
in
applying
what
has
been
referred
to
as
the
historic
control
standard
that
had
originally
been
developed
by
the
courts
under
the
1909
copyright
act
the
district
court
held
that
there
was
a
work-for-hire
employment
relationship
between
ccnv
and
reid
and,
thus,
third
world
america
is
a
work-for-hire.
now,
before
the
district
court,
the
choice
of
the
standard
to
be
applied
under
the
1976
act
was
essentially
non-controversial.
both
mr.
reid
and
ccnv
agreed
that
that
was
the
standard
by
which
one
determines
an
employment
relationship
not
only
under
the
1909
act
but
under
the
1976
act
which,
of
course,
we
were
proceeding
under.
the
case
was
therefore
tried
on
the
basis
that
there
really
was
no
dispute
between
the
parties
as
to
the
legal
standard.
the
district
court,
as
i
said,
applying
that
standard
held
that
this
is
a
work-for-hire.
and
no
one
disputes
in
this
case...
and,
indeed,
the
d.c.
circuit
did
not
dispute...
that
if
one
applies
that
historic
control
standard,
that
this
is
a
work-for-hire
employment
relationship.
now,
rather,
the
dispute
that
has
come
before
this
court
turns
on
whether
that
standard,
the
historic
standard,
is
the
correct
standard
under
the
1976
copyright
act.
we
agree
with
the
position
of
the
second,
the
seventh
and
fourth
circuits,
as
well
as
professor
nimmer,
that
the
historic
standard
is
indeed
the
correct
standard
and
the
district
court
acted
properly
in
applying
it
in
this
case
here.
reid
and
his
various
amici,
however,
have
suggested
that
congress
abandon
the
historic
test
of
the
1976
act
and
they
have
provided
to
this
court
a
variety
of
different
possibilities
of
tests
that
the
court
could
adopt
in
place
of
the
old
historic
test.
one
interesting
fact
from
our
perspective
is
that
neither
mr.
reid
not,
with
one
exception,
any
of
his
amici,
actually
urged
that
this
court
adopt
the
standard
on
which
they
won
before
the
d.c.
circuit,
which
was
essentially
an
agency
law
standard.
now,
we
believe
that
the
reason
that
so
much
distance
has
been
placed
between
the
court
of
appeals
agency
law
standard
and
the
historic
standard
is
that
there
really
is
not
much
difference
between
the
two.
both
turn
on
the
right-to-control.
now,
while
there
may
be
some
differences
that
are
unexplained
by
the
court
of
appeals
below
and
by
the
fifth
circuit
which
also
adopted
that
test,
again,
they
basically
are
going
to
be
looking
at
the
same
totality
of
circumstances
to
determine
whether
the
hiring
party
here
has
the
right-to-control.
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
your
honor,
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
for
a
period
of
almost
ten
years
following
the
passage
of
the
1976
copyright
act
the
copyright
office
agreed
with
our
position,
that
it
is
a
right-to-control
standard
that
determines
whether
there
is
an
employment
relationship
under
the
meaning
of
not
only
the
1909
act
but
the
1976
copyright
act.
they
took
that
position
consistently
in
communications
with
congress
and
in
various
publications
that
they
made
to
the
public.
and
had
the
copyright
office
maintained
that
position
consistently,
i
would
agree
with
you,
your
honor,
that
he
should
be
entitled
to
some
deference.
but
they
haven't
done
that.
a
couple
of
weeks
ago,
in
the
context
of
filing
amicus
brief
in
this
case,
the
copyright
office
announced
for
the
first
time
that
it
was
switching
from
the
historic
standard
to
what
they
call
a
formal
salaried
employee
approach.
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
justice
scalia,
our
position
is
the
historic
test,
and
the
historic
test
is
a
right-to-control
test.
as
we
point
out
on
page
19
of
our
brief,
it
is
a
right-to-control
test.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
in
a
litigation
context
that
we
have
here
and
in
most
of
the
cases
that
arise
in
the
work-for-hire
doctrine
it's
going
to
be
very
difficult
to
establish
that
right
without
showing
actual
supervision
and
control.
actual
control.
and,
in
fact,
that
is
what
happened
in
this
case.
much
of
the
testimony
that
was
heard
by
the
district
court
over
the
two-day
bench
trial
focused
on
actual
control
in
order
to
establish
that
right-to-control.
but
it
is
right-to-control.
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
yes,
your
honor,
in
the
sense
that
they
both
turn
on
concepts
of
right-to-control.
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
justice
scalia,
i
believe
you
are
correct.
and
that
is
the
difference,
as
one...
as
we
would
see
it.
they
both
turn
on
the
right-to-control.
they
both
talk
about
looking
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
to
determine
whether
some
kind
of
control
is
present.
ours
is
control
of
the
artistic
production
here.
it
is
the
test,
as
professor
nimmer
notes
in
his
treatise,
that
is
a
variant
of
the
agency
law
standard.
it
is
one
that
has
been
adopted,
really,
to
serve
the
purposes
and
policies
underlying
the
copyright
act,
as
opposed
to
serving
the
purposes
and
policies
underlying
tort
law
or
agency
law.
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
the
position
that
we
take,
your
honor,
is
that
this
is
not
a
brand
new
thing
that
is
being
connoted
here,
that
this
is
a
test
of
employment
that
had
been
developed
under
the
1909
copyright
act
and
applied
for
a
number
of
years
by
the
courts.
and
that
when
congress
chose
to
use
the
word
101
of
the
1976
act,
it
was
basically
carrying
forward
the
same
test
of
employment
that
had
existed
prior
to
the
act.
the
position
taken
by
the
copyright
office
and
mr.
reid,
however,
is
that
it
wasn't,
even
adopting
your
common
law
agency
stance,
but
rather
some
type
of
formal
salaried
employee
approach.
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
yes,
your
honor.
it's
a
third
approach.
it's
an
approach
that
is
styled
as
a
formal
salaried
employee
approach.
in
fact,
the
approach
that
the
copyright
office
takes
is
somewhat
different
from
the
approach
that
mr.
reid
takes
and
somewhat
different
from
the
approach
that
was
taken
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
recent
dumas
decision,
and
it's
somewhat
different
from
the
approaches
taken
by
various
of
the
amici
in
this
case.
they
are
all
united
under
the
rubric
of
a
formal
salaried
employee
approach,
but
each
has
his
own
slightly
different
version
of
what
is
a
formal
salaried
employee.
and
in
our
view,
none
of
those
versions
was
a
version
that
was
adopted
by
congress
when
it
adopted
the
1976
act.
our
view
is
that
congress
carried
over
into
the
1976
act
the
historic
standard.
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
well,
your
honor,
unfortunately
the
court
of
appeals
does
not
point
out,
nor
does
mr.
reid
or
any
of
his
amici,
that
professor
nimmer
takes
a
quite
different
view.
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
i
would
respectfully
disagree,
your
honor.
he
have
cited
in
our
reply
or
brief,
on
the
final
two
pages
or
so,
a
number
of
other
commentators
who
also
take
the
same
position
that
we
do
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
he
certainly
is,
your
honor,
and
this
court
has
on
other
occasions
certainly
looked
to
his
treatise
to
help
understand
the
copyright
laws.
the
basic
concern
in
this
case,
as
in
any
case
with
statutory
interpretation,
is,
of
course,
starting
with
the
language
of
the
act.
i
think
the
position
of
mr.
reid
and
the
copyright
office
and
the
other
amici
in
this
case,
is
that
congress
in
fact
changed
the
law
in
the
1976
act
because
it
adopted
a
definition
of
the
term
"work-for-hire"
for
the
first
time.
there
was
no
such
definition
in
the
1909
act.
the
1909
act,
however,
said
in
the
case
of
a
work-for-hire,
the
employer
is
considered
to
be
the
copyright
owner
of
the
work.
that
was
section
26.
in
section
201
of
the
1976
act
congress
said
in
the
case
of
a
work
made
for
hire,
it
is
the
employer
or
other
person
for
whom
the
work
has
been
prepared
who
is
the
copyright
owner.
and
i
think
it's
that
simple
comparison
of
language
that
suggests
what
congress
was
doing
in
the
1976
act
was
adding
an
entirely
different
category,
a
new
category,
the
definition
of
work
made
for
hire.
not
those
that
are
prepared
by
employers...
or,
by
employees
acting
within
the
scope
of
employment.
but,
rather,
those
that
are
being
prepared
for
someone
other
than
the
employer.
what
they
were
referring
to
there
was,
of
course,
what
eventually
became
subdivision
2
of
section
101
dealing
with
commission
works.
the
essence
of
the
argument
on
the
other
side
is
that
congress,
by
dealing
with
this
category
of
commissioned
works
in
section
101,
had
effectively
abrogated
the
old
historic
right-to-control
standard.
and
we
submit
that
that's
not
the
case.
there
is
a
great
deal
of
controversy
over
what
kinds
of
works
ought
to
be
considered
commissioned
works
and
treated
as
works
for
hire.
but
throughout
that
controversy
there
was
no
suggestion...
and
there
is
no
suggestion
anywhere
in
either
the
act
itself,
in
the
reports
accompanying
the
act,
in
the
congressional
debates,
the
hearings,
the
register
of
copyright
office
report...
that
suggests
that
the
old
historic
standard
is
being
abandoned
and
replaced
by
something
called
"formal
salaried
employee"
simply
because
congress
was
choosing
to
deal
with
commissioned
works.
congress
did
make
a
change
in
the
1976
act.
it
dealt
with
commissioned
works
and
established
law,
or
clarified
the
law,
and
changed
the
law
in
some
respects,
that
had
developed
under
the
1909
act
with
respect
to
commissioned
works.
but
it
did
not
change
the
law
that
had
developed
under
this
right-to-control
test.
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
well,
i--
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
--they
could
have
said
formal
salaried
employee.
they
could--
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
--have
said
continuous
salaried--
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
--but
they
didn't.
our
view
is,
your
honor,
that
having
said
1976,
and
that
is
the
right-to-control
test.
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
you're
correct,
as
a
general
matter,
your
honor.
but
i'm
talking
about
what
it
meant
in
the
copyright
law.
we're
dealing
here
with
a
special...
a
term
that
has
had
its
own
meaning
developed
in
the
copyright
law,
which
is
a
variant
of
the
meaning
that
it
has
developed
over
the
years
and
the
agency
law.
and
i
say
they
both
derive
from
the
notion
of
right...
right-to-control
here.
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
you're
absolutely
correct.
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
you're
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
this
problem
can
be
dealt
with
by
contract
by
the
parties.
as
i
said
at
the
outset
of
my
argument,
what
you're
dealing
with
here,
the
situation
is
in
which
the
parties
have
not
dealt
with
it
by
contract.
we
are
establishing,
and
the
court
is
establishing...
and
the
court
is
disserting,
more
precisely,
the
guidelines
that
congress
established
in
the
1976
act.
and,
given
the
number
of
amici
who
participated
in
this
case,
this
is
obviously
not
a
problem
that
is...
that
is
where
there
is
no
contracts.
it's
no
obviously
a
problem
that's
simply
limited
to
our
particular
factual
situation
where
we
have
a
voluntary
society
dealing
with
an
artist
who
presumably
knew
what
contract
or
copyright
law
means
and
who
never
took
the
time
to
either
tell
us
that
he
was
reserving
for
himself
the
copyright
or
what
he
intended
to
do
with
the
work
afterwards.
but
you
are
right.
it
can
be
dealt
with
by
a
contract
here.
one
of
the
problems
that
is
noted
by
mr.
reid
and
the
copyright
office
is
that
this
is
a
right-to-control
test.
it
is
a
test
that
is
going
to
result
in
artists,
freelance,
artists
always
giving
up
their
rights.
it
is
an
easy
test
to
satisfy.
and
that
is
not
our
case.
i
think
one
has
to
distinguish,
as
the
courts
have
distinguished,
between
the
right-to-control
and
supervision
and
direction,
and
the
right
to
simply
approve
or
reject
a
work.
the
right-to-control
test
is
not
a
difficult...
or,
is
a
difficult
test
to
meet
in
the
facts
of
the
case.
they
were
met
here,
as
the
district
court
found,
at
the--
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
--no,
your
honor.
i
am
saying
that
it's
the
right-to-control
test,
the
right-to-control
the
artistic
production,
as
justice
scalia
noted
at
the
outset,
which
as
professor
nimmer
notes,
is
a
variation
of
the--
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
--well,
our
position,
your
honor,
is
that
the
term
1909
copyright
act
to
encompass
this
right-to-control
test,
a
right
to
artistic
control,
a
right
to
supervise
the
manner
in
which
the
work
is
performed.
that
is
the
test
that
the
district
court
applied
in
this
case,
and
found
that
it
was
satisfied.
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
i
think
varmer
recognizes
that
there
are
situations
in
which
that
control
is
not
going
to
be
exercised,
and
that's
why
he
uses
the
term
"generally".
it
is,
as
we
said
earlier,
a
right-to-control
test.
what
has
been
done
here
is
simply
to
adopt
the
standard
under
the
old
law
that
had
some
meaning
for
copyright
law.
what
we're
talking
about
in
a
copyright
law
is
encouraging
creative
activity...
encouraging
creativity,
the
type
of
creativity
that
we
think
ccnv
has
supplied
in
this
particular
case.
the
test
that
the
courts
had
applied
was
one
of
right-to-control
that
artistic
production.
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
yes,
your
honor.
the
view
of
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
was
that
that
test
had
been
changed
in
the
1976
act.
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
by
the
act.
by
the
fact
that
congress
in
section
101
subdivision
(2)
dealt
with
commissioned
works.
our
view
is
that
that's
all
congress
dealt
with
in
section
101(2),
is
with
commissioned
works.
it
was
not
intending
to
abrogate
a
standard
that
had
already
existed
in
the
law
here.
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
the
only
word
used
in
the
1909
copyright
act
was
"employer",
your
honor.
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
the
courts,
however,
had
taught
generally
in
terms
of
right...
in
terms
of
the
employment
relationship,
as
professor
nimmer
notes
in
his
1963-1976
versions
of
the
treatise
on
copyright
law.
the...
much
of
what
has
been
discussed
by
the
copyright
office
and
mr.
reid
goes
to
the
concern
of
predictability
and
really
policy
arguments
that
have
been
raised
here.
the
notion
that
the
control
test
is
one
that
is
unpredictable
and,
therefore,
should
not
be
adopted.
our
view,
of
course,
is
that
the
test
is
no
more
or
less
predictable
than
it
was
prior
to
the
1976
act.
it
is
no
more
or
less
predictable
than
the
agency
law
control
standards.
and,
indeed,
when
one
looks
at
the
ninth
circuit
case,
the
dumas
case
which
lists
a
whole
series
of
factors
that
one
looks
at
in
order
to
determine
even
formal
salaried
employment
relationship,
our
test,
the
historic
test,
is
no
more
or
less
predictable
than
that
either.
questions
of
predictability
are
questions
that
ought
to
be
addressed,
if
at
all,
to
congress.
congress,
of
course,
has
been
presented
with
the
formal
salaried
employee
argument
by
various
amici
participating
in
this
case
ever
since
the
year
1982.
our
position
is
that's
the
first
year
in
which
that
particular
test
has
ever
been
surfaced
before
congress.
if
they
feel
that
this
is
a
better
test,
it's
congress
that
should
be
the
one
to
adopt
it.
now,
they
didn't
do
so
in
the
1976
act.
with
your
honor's
permission,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
please.
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
both
mr.
reid
and
the
government
here
refer
to
the
historic
standard
as
one
that
was
adopted
only
nine
years
prior
to
the
1976
copyright
act.
they're
both
wrong.
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
very
first
edition
of
nimmer
on
copyright
in
1963,
you
will
see
that
even
there
he
talks
about
the
right-to-control
standard
as
being
a
standard
well
ingrained
in
the
copyright
laws,
and
cites
cases
going
back
a
number
of
years.
we
cited
cases
in
our
brief
going
back
as
far
as
1937
dealing
with
right-to-control
standard.
furthermore,
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
letter
that
the
register
of
copyright
sent
to
congress
back
in
1986,
you'll
see
that
he
refers...
and
this
is
on
page
2(a)
of
the
appendix
of
our
reply
brief...
as
this
being
a
standard
that
has
been
part
of
our
copyright
laws
for
almost
a
hundred
years.
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
i
think--
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
--i
believe
that
the
courts
were
using
it,
your
honor,
in
the
various
cases
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
in
the
sense
of
right-to-control
the
artistic
production
of
the
work.
something
that
has
meaning
to
what
copyright
law
is
all
about.
not
what
chisel
you
use,
but
rather
how
you
produce
the
particular
statue.
the
kinds
of
contributions
that
we,
ccnv,
made
in
this
particular
case.
that
is
exactly
what
they
were
referring
to.
and
there
was
no
question
in
the
district
court's
mind
when
it
went
to
trial
in
this
case
that
that
was
the
kind
of
standard
it
was
asked
to
look
at.
indeed,
that's
the
standard
that
mr.
reid
said
we
should
look
at,
and
that's
the
standard
that
he
found
was
satisfied
in
this
particular
case.
and
our
view,
your
honors,
is
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
new
standard.
and
we
talk
about
all
of
the
different
standards
in
our
briefs
that
mr.
reid's
amici
have
adopted.
this
morning
i
have
heard
yet
additional
criteria
and
additional
factors
that
one
should
look
at
in
order
to
determine
whether
an
employment
relationship
should
be
met.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
none
of
these
tests...
none
of
these
tests...
was
before
the
district
court
when
we
went
to
trial.
we
all
went
on
the
basis
of
the
historic
right-to-control
test.
and
we
believe
that's
the
correct
test.
but,
if
this
court
is
going
to
adopt
different
test,
as
the
court
of
appeals
below
did,
then
we
ask
that,
at
the
very
least,
that
this
case
be
sent
back
to
the
district
court
so
the
district
court
can
evaluate
the
relationship
of
the
parties
in
light
of
whatever
new-found
standard
is
adopted
here.
that
is
exactly
the
approach
the
court
has
taken
in
other
cases
that
we
cite
in
our
brief,
kelly
v.
southern
railway,
for
example,
a
case
very
much
like
this
one
where
a
different
standard
was
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
determine
who
was
an
employee.
that
was
applied
at
the
district
court
level.
this
court
held
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
with
its
standard,
but
sent
it
back
so
that
the
district
court
could
evaluate
the
facts
of
the
case
under
that
standard.
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
but
not
on
the
work-for-hire
issue,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
it
remanded
on
the
joint
work
theory--
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
--which
is
entirely
different.
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
well,
i
would--
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
--i
would
respectfully
disagree,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
alan
garrett
we
spent
a
good
portion
of
our
brief
talking
about
all
of
the
agency
law
cases
and
why
we
feel
that
there
are
factors
of
this
case
that
would
in
fact
satisfy
those
standards.
and,
furthermore,
your
honor,
if
we
had
known
that
this
was
going
to
be
an
agency
law
type
of
an
approach,
as
opposed
to
the
historic
approach,
it's
possible
that
we
would
have
put
our
case
on
differently
than
we
did.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
we
did
control
a
great
deal
of
the
manner
in
which
the
artist
in
this
case
worked
here.
we
set
guidelines.
thank
you
very
much,
chief
justice.
