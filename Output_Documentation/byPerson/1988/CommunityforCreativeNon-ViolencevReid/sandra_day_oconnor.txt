justice
o'connor
mr.
garrett,
i
take
it
the
principle
to
be
established,
though,
has
far-reaching
consequences
and
would
affect
software
programs
commissioned
by
a
company
or
employer.
justice
o'connor
and
written
work
and
research
that's
ordered
to
be
produced
by
someone.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
garrett,
i
take
it
the
register
of
copyrights
supports
your...
the
respondent's
view
here.
justice
o'connor
and
presumably
there
would
be
some
deference
owing,
perhaps,
to
the
register's
understanding
of
the
copyright
law?
justice
o'connor
well,
most
of
the
scholarly
writers
on
the
subject,
as
pointed
out
by
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
that
we're
reviewing
here,
supported
the
view,
and
do
support
the
view,
that
works
made
for
hire
within
the
meaning
of
the
statutory
definition
are
limited
to
salaried
or
like
employees
and
do
not
include
independent
contractors
even
if
their
work
is
closely
supervised
or
controlled.
justice
o'connor
well,
he
stands
almost
alone
in
the
scholarly
writing
in
taking
that
view.
i...
i--
justice
o'connor
mr.
kaufman,
how
do
you
distinguish
the
test
used
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
dumas
from
that
used
by
the
cacc
in
the
opinion
we're
reviewing?
justice
o'connor
the
ninth
circuit
would
say
unless
you're
a
salaried
employee...
that's
it?
justice
o'connor
you
think
the
ninth
circuit
would
not
look
to
the
old
common
law
of
master/servant?
justice
o'connor
and
what
standard
do
you
suggest
is
proper?
justice
o'connor
so
you
don't
support
the
standard
adopted
by
the
cadc?
justice
o'connor
but
the
statute
says
employee
within
the
scope
of
his
or
her
employment.
so,
you
have
to
read
something
else
into
that
language--
justice
o'connor
--for
your
view.
justice
o'connor
well,
may
i
ask
on
that
point.
you
urged,
apparently,
in
the
brief
that
we
adopt
the
dumas
view.
and
yet
that
is
a
little
more
difficult
to
do
under
the
language
than
the
common
law
master/servant
approach.
