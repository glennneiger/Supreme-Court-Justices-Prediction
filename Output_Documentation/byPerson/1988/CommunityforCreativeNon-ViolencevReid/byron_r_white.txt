justice
white
i
think
the
court
of
appeals,
though,
agreed
with
you
that
prior
to
1976
the
right-to-control
test
had
predominated?
justice
white
by
the
act?
justice
white
and
that
standard,
under
the
prior
act,
was
an
interpretation
of
employee
or
employer?
which?
justice
white
employer.
justice
white
what
about
a
piece
worker?
justice
white
you
have
a
statement
in
your
brief
that
says,
"when
interpreting
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
one
looks
to
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
words
used.
"
justice
white
is
that
the...
you
can't
really
believe
that
that's
the
ordinary
meaning
of
employee.
just
salaried
employees?
justice
white
but
you're
willing
to
go
by
that
then,
to
take
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word
rather
than
what's
revealed
in
the
hearings
or
something
like
that?
justice
white
well,
i
take
it
that...
should
we
be
very
upset
about
this
case?
after
all,
the
statute
allows
you
to
contract
any
way
you
want
to.
just
word
of
mouth...
is
that
so
frequent
and
pervasive
that--
justice
white
--but,
of
course,
if
mr.
snyder
had
a
homeless
lawyer
with
him,
he
might
have
contracted
for--
justice
white
--suppose
an
employer
and
an
employee
could
agree
that
the
copyright
would
be
owned
by
the
employee?
justice
white
--the...
however
clear
you
think
a
commission
is,
the
claim
here
in
this
case,
and
which
the
court
of
appeals
certainly
ruled
on...
the
claim
is
that
this
is
a
work-for-hire
because
there
was
an
employment
relationship.
we
have
to
rule
on
that
claim.
justice
white
i
understand
that.
justice
white
i
know.
they
construed
it.
and
you
say
we
don't
even
need
to.
the
court
below
did
and
i
would
think
we
would
have
to
because
the
claim
is
here
by
the
petitioner
that...
that
there
was
an
employment
relationship.
justice
white
we
certainly
have
to
dispose
of
that...
rule
on
that
claim.
justice
white
and
so
you
struggled
with
what
an
employee
is,
eh?
justice
white
well,
i
guess
we
have
to
too.
