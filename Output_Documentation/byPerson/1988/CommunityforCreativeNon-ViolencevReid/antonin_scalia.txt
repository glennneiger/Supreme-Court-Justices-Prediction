justice
scalia
excuse
me.
it
goes
to
some
individual,
either
to
mr.
reid
or
to
your
organization.
if
your
organization
chooses
to
give
it
to
the
homeless,
that's
certainly
your
organization's
business.
you
don't
assume...
you
don't
assert
you're
bound
to
give
it
to
the
homeless.
justice
scalia
you
just
assert
you're
entitled
to
it.
justice
scalia
so
it
really
isn't
the
homeless
against
mr.
reid.
it's
you
against
mr.
reid,
as
i
understand
the
case.
justice
scalia
well,
that's
nice,
but
you
don't
have
to.
justice
scalia
and
mr.
reid
could
come
in
and
say
the
same
thing.
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
to
the
case.
justice
scalia
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
your
legal
position
would
be
unchanged
if
you
were
going
to
use
the
money
to...
whatever...
for
any
other
purpose,
right?
justice
scalia
okay.
justice
scalia
mr.
garrett,
can
you
tell
me
your
proposed
standard.
you
say
it's
right-to-control,
but
the
respondent's
really
assert
that
what
you're
applying
is
a
de
facto
control.
is
your
test
whether
control
could
be
asserted
or
could
have
been
asserted,
or
whether
it
in
fact
was
asserted?
justice
scalia
may
i
ask
you
another
question?
you
say
there
is
not
much
difference
between
your
right-to-control
standard
and
the
common
law
employee
standard.
you
say
they're
pretty
much
the
same.
justice
scalia
but
i...
you
see,
i
understand
what
you
mean
by
right-to-control,
the
right-to-control
the
product.
whether
the
statute
should
have
these
characteristics
and
what
not.
and
i
don't
think
that's
at
all
what
the
common
law
agent...
master/servant
law
means
by
right-to-control.
that
is
to
say,
even...
even
if...
even
if
you
nave
no
right
to...
even
if
you
rave
the
right-to-control
the
product,
the
individual
may
still
be
an
independent
contractor.
you
can
tell
the
independent
contractor,
"i
want
the
wall
with
eight
angles.
"
then
you
may
change
your
mind
and
say,
"no,
i
want
it
with
nine
angles.
"
and
he
has
to
do
your
bidding.
but
he
could
still
be
an
independent
contractor.
what
is
needed
is
the
right-to-control
his
physical
activity.
to
tell
him,
"i
want
you
to
put
the
bricks
in
this
way.
"
"knock
off
at
12:00,
come
back
at
2:00.
"
and
so
forth.
and
you're
not
asserting
anything
like
that.
you're
just
asserting
the
right-to-control
the
nature
of
the
work.
that's
quite
different
from
the
master/servant
law...
common
law,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
scalia
one
would
think
when
he
uses
the
word
"employee"
in
a
statute
that
it
would
connote
that
brand
new
thing
which
is
nothing
like...
which
is
nothing
like
what
it
means
at
common
law.
justice
scalia
why
didn't
they
just
say
right-to-control?
i
mean,
if
what
you
say
is
true,
find
it
extraordinary
that
they
should
choose
to
describe
this...
what
you
call
this
old
law
by
the
phrase
"a
work
prepared
by
an
employee
within
the
scope
of
his
or
her
employment.
"
that's
just
a
very
strange
way
to
say
that.
justice
scalia
they
could
have
said
right-to-control...
they
could
have
said.
justice
scalia
i
agree.
justice
scalia
i
agree
with
you
that
too.
i'm
with
you
on
that
one.
justice
scalia
that's
not
what
it
meant
in
the
law.
i
mean,
what
it
meant
in
the
law
was...
was
master/servant.
justice
scalia
mr.
garrett,
i
do
think
that...
for
me,
at
least...
it's
important
to
your
case
that
the
word
pre-76
old
law,
as
you
call
it
in
that
sense.
and
i'm
not
sure
that's
true.
one
of
your
major
authorities
for
what
the
old
law
was,
is
varmer,
his
1958
study.
and
the
part
of
that
study
that
you
choose
to
italicize
because
you
think
it's
so
crucial
is
the
following
sentence.
21
of
your
brief.
justice
scalia
"underlying
this
distinction
between",
that
is,
between
employer/employee
and
commissioned
products,
"is
the
premise
that
an
employer
generally
gives
more
direction
and
exercises
more
control
over
the
work
of
his
employee
than
does
a
commissioner
with
respect
to
the
work
of
an
independent
contractor.
"
i
read
that
to
say
that
the
reason
the
copyright
law
has
drawn
the
line
at
the
old
master/servant
line
is
that
generally
speaking
the
master
exercises
more
control.
but
the
criterion
is
master/servant.
the
reason
we've
selected
that
criterion
is
because
he
generally
exercises
more
control
over
the
artistic
product.
but
that's
not
the
test.
that's
how
i
would
read
varmer
anyway.
justice
scalia
mr.
kaufman,
i
don't
really
agree
with
you
that
the
common
meaning
of
employee
is
salaried
employee.
i
think
when
you
mention
employee
to
the
person
in
the
street
the
first
they
think
of
is
a
salaried
employee.
just
as
if
you
mention
a
dog,
the
first
thing
they
think
of
is
an
animal
with
four
legs
and
a
tail.
but
i
have
a
dog
that
doesn't
have
a
tail
and
nobody
thinks
it
isn't
a
dog.
[laughter]
and
i
think
if
you
describe...
if
you
describe
to
somebody
on
the
street
a
pieceworker,
as
justice
white
just
suggested,
let's
say
somebody
that
works
for
the
international
ladies'
garment
workers
union
but
gets
paid
instead
of
per...
you
know,
by
the
hour,
by
the
number
of
dresses
that
he
or
she
completes.
i
don't
think
the
person
would
think
that
that
person
suddenly
is
no
longer
an
employee.
i
think
you've
snatched
this
concept
of
hourly
wages
just
out
of
the
air.
most
employees
are
like
that
but
i
don't...
i
don't
know
that
that's
a
common
meaning
of
employee.
justice
scalia
what
about
the
people
that
your
client
hired
to
help
him
in...
in
doing
this
statue?
suppose
he
told
them,
"i
just
want
you
to
help
me
on
this
one
job
and
don't
you
to
help
me
on
any
others.
"
"and
i'm
going
to
pay
you
$500
for
the
whole
job.
"
"i
want
you
to
follow
my
instructions.
"
"where
i
tell
you
to
curve,
you
curve.
"
"where
i
tell
you
to
make
a
sharp
corner,
you
do
that.
"
"you
report
to
work
when
i
tell
you.
"
"you
leave
when
i
tell
you.
"
they
are
not
employees
within
the
meaning
that
you
would
urge
upon
us,
right?
justice
scalia
well,
that's
very
strange.
justice
scalia
i
think
even
the
man
in
the
street
would
consider
them
employees,
plus
the
traditional
legal
connotation
of
employee.
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
who
doesn't
work
for
wages?
i
mean,
if
that's
all
you
mean
by
salaried.
you
mean
it
just
excludes
those
who
are
working
for
free?
justice
scalia
well,
you've
given
me
a
whole
new
theory.
i
thought
salaried
meant
what
salaried
normally
means,
you
get
paid
on
a
regular
basis.
weekly,
monthly,
annually.
not
by
the
piece.
justice
scalia
including
commission?
justice
scalia
oh,
boy.
justice
scalia
i
thought
they
were
opposites.
you
know,
do
you
work
on
salary
or
you
want
commission?
i
work
on
commission.
you're
telling
me
it's
at
the
same.
salary
is
anything.
justice
scalia
mr.
kaufman,
can
i
ask
you
about
your
assertion
earlier
that
we
should
adopt
your
interpretation
because
only
that
gives
meaning
to
the
phrase
"within
the
scope
of
his
or
her
employment.
"
in
the
statute.
i
don't
know...
let's
go
back
to
the
example
earlier.
you
acknowledged
that
if
your...
if
the
workers
that
your
client
hired
were
just
paid
by
the
job.
say,
"work
for
me
and
i'll
give
you
$500
and
i
want
you
to
follow
my
directions.
"
you
acknowledged
that
they
would
not
be
employees
under
your
interpretation.
justice
scalia
don't
you
think
the
meaning
of
"within
the
scope
of
his
or
her
employment.
"
would
be
clear
under
an
ordinary...
if
you
adopted
the
court
of
appeals'
interpretation
here
and
used
agency,
ordinary
agency
principles,
wouldn't
it
be
clear
what
"within
the
scope
of
their
employment.
"
means?
anything
they
did
in
connection
with
the
statue
would
be
covered.
if
they
created
some
new
statute
on
their
own
at
home,
it
would
be
outside
the
scope
of
their
employment.
i
don't
see
the
problem.
justice
scalia
under
the
aldon
test.
justice
scalia
i
see.
justice
scalia
okay.
how
about
under
your
test?
justice
scalia
but
would
you
first
explain
to
me
your
earlier
statement,
that
we
can
just
do
this
on
the
basis
of
subsection
2
alone.
i
can't
understand...
i
could
understand
that
if
subsection
2
said
it
includes...
work-for-hire
includes
special
ordered
or
commissioned
works
only
if
they
come
within
these
nine
categories.
but
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
it
happens
to
include
those
special-ordered
or
commissioned
works.
it
doesn't
say
it
does
not
include
any
other
special-ordered
or
commissioned
work.
so
you're
ultimately
driven
back
to
one,
aren't
you,
to
see
whether
it
comes
within
one?
justice
scalia
no?
justice
scalia
well--
justice
scalia
well,
they
could
have
been
so
clear
if
they
had
said
one...
a
work
made
for
hire
is,
one,
a
work
other
than
a
special
ordered
or
commissioned
work
prepared
by
an
employee
within
the
scope
of
his
employment,
or,
two,
a
work
specially
ordered
or
commissioned
for
use,
blah,
blah,
blah.
you
just
want
us
to
read
in
that
language
into
1,
which
just
isn't
there.
justice
scalia
that
depends
on
what
all
those
old
cases
were
referring
to
when
they
said
right-to-control.
i
mean,
you
can
describe
the
master/servant
rule
as
a
right-to-control
rule
also.
justice
scalia
you
have
to
assume
that
they're
using
right-to-control
in
the
very
narrow
sense
that
you're
using
it.
not
right-to-control
physical
activities
but
just
to
control
the
product,
the
outcome.
justice
scalia
--but
is
it
really
at
all
questionable,
mr.
garrett,
whether
if
you
adopt
the
court
of
appeals'
theory
of
the
common
law
master/servant
rule
that
your
client
was
not
a
servant?
that...
that...
i'm
sorry...
that
the
artist
here
was
not
a
servant?
justice
scalia
that
ccnv
could
not
tell
him
what
chisel
to
use,
couldn't
tell
him
when
to
come
into
work,
and
so
forth.
justice
scalia
really?
