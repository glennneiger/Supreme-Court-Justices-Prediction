we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in

community
for
creative
non-violence,
et
al.,
versus
james
earl
reid.
mr.
garrett.
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
see
the
copyright
office
as
taking
a
third
approach
as
between
the
court
of
appeals
here
and
the
fifth
circuit
on
the
one
hand
and
then
still
the
courts
of
appeals
that
you
rely
on?
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
you
saying
the
right-to-control
test
as
traditionally
applied
in
master/servant
law,
workmen's
compensation,
that
sort
of
thing,
to
define
a
distinction
between
an
employee
and
an
independent
contractor?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
then
you
have
a
very
difficult
time
with
the
word
1,
it
seems
to
me.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
garrett.
i
neglected
to
say
at
the
opening
of
this
session
that
justice
brennan
is
unavoidably
absent
due
to
a
death
in
the
family.
he
will
participate
in
today's
cases
on
the
basis
of
the
transcripts
and
the
tapes.
mr.
kaufman.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
can
you
give
an
example
of
a
case
which
would
come
out
differently
as
between
the
d.c.
and
the
ninth
circuits?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
don't
think
you
had
an
opportunity
to
finish
answering
justice
o'connor's
question.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--you're
talking
about
section
2
now?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kaufman.
mr.
robbins.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
we
should
struggle
with
the
various
historical
definitions
of
"commission"?
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
a
better
job
of
embodying
your
views.
chief
justice
rehnquist
a
better
job
of
embodying
your
views.

chief
justice

thank
you,
mr.
robbins.
mr.
garrett,
you
have
four
minutes

justice

justice

the
joint
