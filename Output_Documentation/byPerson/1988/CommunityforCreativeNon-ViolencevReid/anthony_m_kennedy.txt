of
course,
to
the
extent
that
one
who
pays
for
the
work
really
is
concerned
about
protecting
his
or
her
artistic
contribution,
i
suppose
that
under
the
statutory
scheme
that
person
who
hires
can
simply
contract.
i
know
hindsight
is
always
difficult
to
deal
with,
but
in
this...
in
this
situation
you
had
the
perfect
right
to
contract
with
the
sculptor
to
say
that
the
copyright
would
be
exclusively
yours.
justice
kennedy
and
that's
a
very
simple
statutory
scheme.
justice
kennedy
well,
i
suppose
that
just
includes
wages
too,
doesn't
it?
justice
kennedy
that
just
includes
what
would
be
called
wages,
i
suppose.
justice
kennedy
okay.
