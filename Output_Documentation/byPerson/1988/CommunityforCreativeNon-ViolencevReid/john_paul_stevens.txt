mr.
kaufman,
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
employee
must
nave
been
an
employee
before
the
arrangement
for
the
particular
work
of
art
was
made?
justice
stevens
can
you
provide
in
the
agreement
that
he'll
be
discharged
when
the
work
is
completed?
justice
stevens
supposing
in
this
case,
say,
it
takes
five
months
to
build
this
work
of
art.
supposing
at
the
start
when
they
talked
about
$15,000,
they
said,
"we'll
pay
you
$3,000
on
the
first
of
each
month.
"
and
by
then
you've
already
indicated
you'll
be
through
with
the
job.
and
we'll
pay
you
that
amount
no
matter
what
time
you
finish
but
presumably
within
the
time.
would
the
artist
have
been
an
employee
then?
justice
stevens
well,
the
rest
of
the
contract
is
we
want
you...
you
know,
we
want
to
get
this
work
of
art
done
and--
justice
stevens
--and
we
want
you
to
prepare
it
the
way
we
designed
it.
it's
our
idea
and
we
want
you
to
build
this
work
of
art.
justice
stevens
no,
not
"go
create".
prepare
it
in
accordance
with
our
conception
of
the
plan.
justice
stevens
do
you
think
you
need
workmen's
comp
and
withholding?
justice
stevens
well,
their
other
employees
don't
get
anything
in
this
particular
organization.
under
that
test
it
seems
to
me
you
might
well
not
be
so
successful--
justice
stevens
--because
they
don't
treat
other
employees
by
paying...
by
taking
withholding
and
all
the
rest
of
it.
justice
stevens
well,
mr.
robbins--
--mr.
robbins,
these
are
not
mutually
exclusive
categories.
a
thing
can
be
both
specially...
you
could
specially
commission
an
employee
to
do
a
job.
justice
stevens
what
i
mean,
it's
reading
the
language...
that
it's
linguistically
possible.
justice
stevens
and
if
it's
as
clear
as
you
say
it
is,
the
thing
that
i'd
just
like
you
to
talk
about
for
a
minute
is
how
is
it
that
the
register
of
copyright
and
professor
nimmer
got
it
so
wrong
for
so
many
years?
justice
stevens
all
right.
justice
stevens
six
years.
justice
stevens
oh,
i
don't
question
the
authority
of
the
register
to
change
his
or
her
mind.
but
it
just...
if
it's
as
perfectly
clear
as
we
all
seem
to
think
it
is
on
the
face
of
the
plain
language,
it's
kind
of
hard
to
understand
how
anybody
could
have
made
a
mistake.
