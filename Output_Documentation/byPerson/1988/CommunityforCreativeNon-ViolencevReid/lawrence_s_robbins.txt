mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
october
1985
when
mr.
snyder
called
mr.
reid
on
the
phone
and
proposed
that
he
sculpt
the
three
human
figures
for
the
statue
third
world
america,
the
two
men
had
never
met
before.
they'd
never
done
any
business
before.
and
except
for
suing
each
other,
they've
done
no
business
since
the
statue
was
created.
[laughter]
in
short,
their
entire
relationship
was
defined
by
the
particular
project
that
mr.
reid
agreed
to
create.
that
kind
of
relationship
is
what
i
think
most
people
mean
by
the
word
"commission".
indeed,
mr.
snyder
used
himself
no
fewer
than
eight
times
at
trial
to
describe
his
relationship
with
reid.
that
is
the
same
word
that
mr.
snyder's
trial
counsel
used
when
he
summed
up
the
trial,
and
it's
the
precise
finding
made
by
the
trail
court
when
it
explained
that
"third
world
america
was
commissioned
by
ccnv
and
made
on
commission
by
the
artist.
"
now,
as
it
happens,
there
was
a
provision
in
the
work
made
for
hire
definition
that
speaks
directly
to
commissioned
works.
and
the
court
has
not
heard
very
much
about
that
provision
this
morning.
that
subsection,
which
is
subsection
2,
states
that
specially
ordered
or
commissioned
works
will
be
treated
as
works
made
for
hire
when
they
satisfy
both
of
two
conditions.
that
they
fall
within
the
nine
enumerated
categories,
and
that
there
is
a
writing
executed
by
the
parties.
the
position
of
the
register
of
copyrights
in
this
case
is
simple
and
straightforward.
the
word
2
should
be
taken
at
its
word,
should
be
given
its
plain
and
literal
meaning.
and
when
that
meaning
is
honored,
it's
perfectly
clear
that
third
world
america
is
a
commissioned
work.
the
court
need
not
struggle
with
the
various
historical
definitions
of
the
word
"employee"
because
this
is
a
case
about
the
word
"commission".
and
if--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
in
fact
that
is...
if
it's
a
struggle
at
all...
is
a
rather
lesser
struggle.
and
i
think
that
it
has
a
word
that
embraces
more
uniformity
and
a
wider
acceptance.
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
this
relationship,
where
an
artist
is
engaged
to
sculpt
a
particular
project
and
nothing
more,
is
what
i
think
most
people
take
the
word
"commission"
to
mean,
and
it's
perfectly
clear
that
that's
what
the
draftsmen
of
this
statute
took
the
word
to
mean.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
i
think,
justice
stevens,
that
it
is...
it
is
theoretically
possible
to
have
these
categories
be
overlapping
in
part.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
there
is
no
question
that
it
is
linguistically
possible.
i
think--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
let
me
address
the
subject
i
can
address
with
more
authority--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--how
it
is
that
the
register
of
copyrights
got
it
wrong.
it's
our
view
that
the
register
of
copyrights
did
get
it
wrong.
but
for
so
long
is
something
that
i
might
want
to
quarrel
with.
it
is
true
that--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--it
is
true
that
in
response
to
inquiries
from
congress
in
the
mid-80s
the
register
of
copyrights
offered
a
position
quoting
from
nimmer
that
is
at
odds
with
his
present
one.
i
think,
however,
that
if
you
look
back
to
the
position
of
the
register
when
these
provisions
were
in
fact
being
adopted,
when
they
were
being
negotiated,
and
when
the
understanding
of
the
parties
was
fresh,
the
register's
position
was
very
much
like
its
present
one.
but,
in
any
event,
in
light
of
this
litigation
the
register
has
revisited
the
issue
in
detail
and
frankly
has
disavowed
those
previous
filings.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
it
wouldn't
be
the
first
time
that
words
end
up
having
a
plain
meaning
as
to
which
other
people
disagree.
but
i'd
like
to
talk
a
little
bit
about
subsection
2
because
the
thing
that
is
as
clear
as
anything
else--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--no.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
justice
scalia,
i
think
that's
not
correct.
and
the
reason
it's
not
correct
is
that
if
there
is
nothing
else
clear
from
the
history
of
subsection
2,
as
reflected
in
the
accompanying
house
report
both
in
the
'76
act
and
in
all
the
prior
revisions,
the
fact
is
clear
that
the
nine
categories
were
intended
to
be
the
only
ways,
the
only
kinds
of
commissioned
works
that
could
ever
become
works
made
for
hire.
and
the
central
fallacy
of
petitioner's
argument
this
morning
is
that
even
if
you
fail
to
come
in
with
one
of
those
nine
categories,
subsection
2
will
get
you
to
the
promised
land
under
their
test.
even
if
you're
a
sculptor
and
you're
not
within
the
nine
categories,
why,
then,
you
can
still
become
a
work
made
for
hire
if
you
satisfy
what
they
call
the
historic
standard,
which,
by
the
way,
is
as
historic
as
1966
in
the
second
circuit's
brattleboro
decision--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--and
goes
back
no
further
than
that.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
my
understanding,
justice
white,
is
in
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
was
not
a
work
made
for
hire
because
they--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--the
court
construing
subsection
1
under
the--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--that's--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
justice
white,
we
have
offered
what
we
think
the
correct
interpretation
of
subsection
1
is.
but
i
think--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
we've
done
our
best.
[laughter]
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
but...
but--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--no,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
the
reason
we
agree
with
the
dumas
construction
of
subsection
1
is
that
that
is
the
conception
of
the
employee
that
the
draftsmen
of
subsection
1
had
in
mind.
this
so-called
historic
right-to-control
test
is
something
that
emerged
in
1966
when
these
provisions
were
set
in
stone
by
the
people
who
came
up
with
them.
and
they
were
then
enacted
in
whole
cloth
by
congress
11
years
later,
much
as
the
derivatives
works
exception
was
handled
by
congress
in
the
mills
music
situation.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
in
subsection
2
those
nine
categories
were
intended
to
be
exclusive.
if
this
was
a
commissioned
work,
as
that
word
was
understood
in
its
common
parlance,
then
you
had
to
satisfy
subsection
2.
and
if
you
didn't,
it
was
simply
not
a
work
made
for
hire.
the
central
fallacy
of
petitioners'
argument
is
that
it
gives
commissioned
works
another
way
to
become
a
work
made
for
hire,
and
there
is
nothing
clearer
than
that
is
precisely
what
the
draftsmen
sought
to
avoid.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
justice
scalia,
i
won't
quarrel
with
the
fact
that
congress
and
the
draftsmen
could
have
done
a
better
job,
and
maybe
someday
they
will.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i'm
sorry?
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
i
think
they
could
have
done
a
better
job
of
embodying
their
own
views.
i
think
that
we
are
as
faithful
as
we
can
to
what
they
had
in
mind.
the
accompanying
house
report,
for
example,
says,
justice
scalia,
that
subsection
2
is
a
compromise
intended
to
divide
commissioned
works
between
those
that
could
be
and
could
not
be
works
made
for
hire.
the
only...
i
think...
sensible
way
to
read
that
language
is
that
if
you're
not
in
subsection
2
and
you're
commissioned,
you're
not
a
work
made
for
hire.
they're
not.
they
are
commissioned.
it's
not
a
work
made
for
hire.
it's
just
that
simple.
