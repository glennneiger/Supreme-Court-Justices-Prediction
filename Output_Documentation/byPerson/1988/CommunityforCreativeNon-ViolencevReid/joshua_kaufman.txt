mr.
joshua
kaufman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
fall
of
1985
mitch
snyder
called
james
reid.
they
had
two
conversations
on
the
phone.
mr.
reid
then
agreed
to
create
a
work
of
art
for
ccnv.
at
the
inception
of
their
relationship
james
earl
reid
was
an
independent
contractor
and
he
was
going
to
create
a
commission.
and
that
is
true
under
any
standard
or
any
test.
section
2
of
the
work-for-hire
definition
deals
with
commissions.
it
lists
nine
very
specific
categories
of
works
which
can
be
deemed
works
for
hire
when
created
by
independent
contractors.
sculpture
is
not
one
of
those
nine
works
or
categories
listed.
it
also
requires
a
writing.
there
was
no
writing
in
this
case.
no
work-for-hire
situation,
relationship,
was
created
under
the
language
of
the
act.
as
the
ninth
circuit
just
found
in
dumas,
it
one
holds
himself
out
as
an
independent
contractor,
the
commissioner
is
on
notice,
and
that
they
must
take
certain
actions
to
insure
that
the
section
2
requirements
are
fulfilled.
james
earl
reid--
mr.
joshua
kaufman
--i
think
that
the
dumas
test
provides
a
greater
degree
of
predictability.
the
salaried
formal
employee
and
the
agency
test
are
slightly
different.
there
are
certainly
areas
of
overlap
but
we
look
to--
mr.
joshua
kaufman
--it
looks
at
section
1,
an
employee
within
the
scope
of
his
or
her
employment.
and
that's
an
employee.
it
looks
at
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word,
the
one
that
is
understood
by
most
people,
and
that's
where
they
stop.
in
section
2
it
deals
with
independent
contractors
and
commissions.
and
those
are
very
understood
words.
a
commission--
mr.
joshua
kaufman
--no,
i
do
not.
i
think
only
where
that
would
apply
to
a
salaried
employee.
but
i
think
it's
a
different
criteria
and
i
think
they
look
at
the
most
common
ordinary
use,
the
most
predictable
use.
mr.
joshua
kaufman
we
believe
that
the
dumas
test
is
the
best
standard.
we
believe
it
provides
the
greatest
predictability.
mr.
joshua
kaufman
we
believe
they
came
to
the
correct
conclusion
and
we
think
that
it
is
the
second-best
test.
compared
to
the
aldon
test
it
is
by
far
superior.
but
we
think
that
the
dumas
test,
as
recently
enunciated
just
a
month
ago,
does
provide
the
best
test
of
the
three
that
are
before
the
courts
by
the
various
circuits.
mr.
joshua
kaufman
the
situation
where
you
would
have
someone
who
would
be
an
agent
but
nut
a
salaried
employee.
mr.
joshua
kaufman
you
would
have
a...
a
piece
worker...
under
the
agency
which
we
look
at
respondeat
superior
perhaps
a
piece
worker
where
they
don't
have
fica
withholdings
and
you
don't
get
some
of
the
other
benefits...
but
they
are
under
the
control,
the
ten
categories
of
control
that
are
set
out
in
the
restatement,
you
might
have
a
situation...
and
probably
not
regularly
but
not
infrequently...
where
you
would
not
have
some
indicia
of
formal
salaried
employees,
workmen's
comp,
like
i
said,
withholding,
fica,
and
some
of
those
others,
but
would
satisfy
the
various
control
tests.
mr.
joshua
kaufman
well,
i
don't
think
that
a
formal
salaried
employee
is...
the
method
of
payment
in
the
sense
of
a
salary
is
merely
a
weekly...
it
could
be
based
on
a
long-term
job.
it
could
be
based
on
piece.
it
could
be
on
commissions,
commission
and
salary.
there
are
many
ways
that
a
formal
salaried
employee--
mr.
joshua
kaufman
--no,
they
would
not
be
employees.
they
would--
mr.
joshua
kaufman
--under
agency
law
they
probably
would,
but
not
under
the
formal
salaried--
mr.
joshua
kaufman
--we
think
they
would
fall
outside
this
definition.
mr.
joshua
kaufman
correct.
mr.
joshua
kaufman
you
have
a
full-time
salaried
employee...
let's
assume
they
work
9:00
to
5:00
or
whatever
the
hours
are.
mr.
joshua
kaufman
pardon
me?
mr.
joshua
kaufman
salary
would
be
wages,
yes.
well,
whatever
they
would
be.
mr.
joshua
kaufman
they
could
be
commissions.
it
could
be...
but--
mr.
joshua
kaufman
--no.
you
can
have
many
different
forms
of
wages.
you
look
at
the
entire
picture
to
see...
when
they
are
an
employee,
you
look
at
the
various
criteria
that
dumas
has
set
out.
you
look
for
the
various
aspects
of
benefits,
taxes--
mr.
joshua
kaufman
--but
if
your
long-term
relationship
with
your
employer
is
based
on
a
piece
salary,
on
a
commissioned
salary,
you
can
be
on
salary
and
commission
both.
i'm
not
looking
at
it
in
the
sense
of...
i
don't
believe
the
dumas
court
looked
at
it
that
it
has
to
be
that
you're
paid
biweekly
for
a
salary.
a
salary
can
take
many
different
forms.
and
as
long
as
it
is
there
on
a
regular--
mr.
joshua
kaufman
--of
course.
you
can
have
people
on--
mr.
joshua
kaufman
--a
commission
as
well
as
a...
you
know,
you
get
paid
"x"
dollars
an
hour
plus
a
commission
and
be
a
regular
salaried
employee.
yes.
mr.
joshua
kaufman
as
long
as
it
maintains
a
regular
type
of
pattern,
it
could
be
a
salary.
yes.
mr.
joshua
kaufman
that's
correct,
your
honor.
under
the
salaried
employee
test
or
under
the
definition...
excuse
me...
of
the
copyright
law,
you
nave
the
opportunity
to
work
for
your
employer
within
the
scope
of
the
employment
from
the
9:00
to
5:00
position,
and
if
you
create
something
outside
of
that
scope,
it
is
the
creator's.
it
is
not
the
employer's.
that's
one
of
the
interesting
problems
with
the
test
presented
by
petitioner.
it's
that
everything
created
under
their
test,
by
definition,
becomes
part
of
the
scope
of
the
employment.
there
is
nothing
that
you
can
create
as
part
of
the
relationship
that
outside
the
scope
of
employment,
thus,
rendering
the
second
half
of
the
definition
meaningless.
one
of
the
interesting
points
when
we
were
discussing...
petitioner
was
bringing
up
the
issue
of
this
historic
definition.
it
was
historic...
it
was
in
existence
for
nine
years,
from
1966
to
1975.
prior
to
1966
independent
contractors
were
never
considered
employees
under
the
work-for-hire
doctrine.
and
if
the
court
looks
at
the
legislative
history
of
this
case,
which
is
very
similar
to
the
legislative
history
in
mills
music
which
you
ruled
on,
it
was
the
same
legislative
history,
and
it
took
place
in
1965.
in
1965
independent
contractors
were
not
employees
within
the
scope
of
employment.
there
were
other
problems
with
them.
and
it
was
the
law
in
1965
which
is
what
was
enacted
in
1976.
the
legislative
history
for
this
law
was
very
unique.
what
happened
was
that
we
had
a
1909
act
that
was
becoming
rapidly
obsolete
because
of
the
technological
advances.
many
special
interest
groups
were
before
the
congress
and
they
could
not
pass
legislation.
there
was
a
legislative
gridlock,
so
to
speak.
so
congress,
through
its
agent,
the
copyright
office,
went
out
on
a
different
trail
to
break
this
impasse.
what
they
did
was
they
commissioned
studies
and
reports.
and
then
they
brought
all
the
players
together.
the
copyright
office
picked
representatives
who
they
felt
represented
the
various
interests,
sat
them
down,
and
forced
them
to
negotiate
together
until
they
came
up
with
a
consensus.
and
this
consensus...
and
this
type
of
process
happened
in
cable,
fair
use,
termination,
manufacturing
clauses.
it
is
replete
throughout
the
whole
process.
and
those
compromises
is
what
was
enacted
into
law
in
1976.
in
1965
the
termination
and
the
work-for-hire
hearings
all
took
place
and
ended.
and
in
1976
when
the
law
was
enacted,
it
was
almost
identical
language
that
came
out
of
these
negotiations
and
hearings
in
1965.
that
is
the
language
in
the
statute.
and
the
law
at
the
time
did
not
have
independent
contractors,
employees
for
hire.
that
came
afterwards.
that
was
not
what
was
before
the
congress.
it
was
not
the
compromise,
as
part
of
the
compromise
which
they
adopted.
and
that
is
clear
from
the
case
law
and
from
all
the
different
participants
at
the
hearings.
we
cite
extensive
quotes.
and
it
didn't
matter
which
side
of
the
table
they
were
on,
be
in
industry
or
the
artists,
they
all
used
the
term
"employee"
as
a
formal
salaried
employee.
we
think
that
is
what
was
meant
at
the
time.
mr.
joshua
kaufman
and
we
believe
that
the
dumas
court
was
correct
in
looking
at
it
as
the
salaried
employee.
i
know
judge--
mr.
joshua
kaufman
--i
think
when
people
are...
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word
"salaried
employee"--
mr.
joshua
kaufman
--no.
i
think
the
hearings
are
in
sync
with
that.
when
they...
if
you
look
at
the
language
of
the
participants
in
the
hearings
and
the
cases
prior
to
1965,
you'll
see
they
used
the
term
"employee"
in
the
formal
sense
of
the
word.
and
they
had...
again,
we
have
quotes
in
there
where
they
talk
about
how...
oh,
we
don't
have
to
put
these
people
on
the
payroll
and
make
them
salaried
people,
that
would
be
such
a
problem,
and
so
on.
and
it
is...
the
record
is
replete
with
references
to
salaried
employees,
and
that's
what
the
case
law
also
was
in
1965.
i
do
believe
that
the
man
on
the
street,
if
you
say
to
them
the
ordinary
meaning
of
who
is
an
employee,
they
think
of
the
very
traditional
relationship
of
somebody
who
goes
to
work
9:00
to
5:00,
gets
benefits,
taxes
withheld.
i
think
that's
what
people
think
of
as
an
employee.
i
think
agency...
the
definition
of
agency
is
very
widely
used
but
it's
a
lawyer's
definition
of
the
word.
it
is
not
the
ordinary
common...
i
think
when
you
take
a
step
back--
mr.
joshua
kaufman
--either
before
or
that
was
part
of
the
negotiations
at
the
outset
of
it.
you
can
go
to
somebody,
hire
them
as
a
formal
employee
so
that
the
work
that
is
created
afterwards
can
be--
mr.
joshua
kaufman
--if
it's
for
a
sufficient
amount
of
time.
mr.
joshua
kaufman
it
depends
on
the
rest
of
the
contract.
will
they
be
getting
other
benefits?
mr.
joshua
kaufman
no.
then
they
would
be--
mr.
joshua
kaufman
--no,
i
don't
believe
if
it
was
"go
create
it
and
we'll
give
you
$3,000
at
the
beginning
of
every
month.
"
--i
think
he's
an--
mr.
joshua
kaufman
--i
still
think
that's
an
independent
contractor.
if
they
said,
come
into
our
shop
where
you
can
accrue
benefits,
we'll
do
workmen's
comp,
we'll
do
withholdings
and
the
other
indicia
of
salaried
employee--
mr.
joshua
kaufman
--they
vary...
withholdings,
workmen's
comp,
and
how
they
treat
their
other
employees.
do
they
give
them
vacations?
mr.
joshua
kaufman
the--
mr.
joshua
kaufman
--they
may
not
have
any
employees,
is
what
i
believe.
they
have
volunteers
and
people
who
are
independent
contractors
who
do
their
work.
but
i
don't
think
any
of
the
people
who
volunteer
for
ccnv
are
employees.
no.
i
think
there
has
to
be
an
employment
relationship,
not
a
volunteer
relationship.
mr.
joshua
kaufman
correct.
mr.
joshua
kaufman
under
the
agency
law
test,
scope
of
employment
has
meaning.
under
the
aldon
test,
it
has
none,
is
what
we're
saying.
mr.
joshua
kaufman
the
aldon
test,
the
test
proposed
by
the
petitioners--
mr.
joshua
kaufman
--supervision.
then
it
has
no
meaning.
under
agency
it
absolutely
has...
meaning.
mr.
joshua
kaufman
under
our
test
it
certainly
has
a
meaning.
at
5:00
it's...
the
scope
of
employment
is--
mr.
joshua
kaufman
--what
is
important
here...
word
of
mouth
in
this
area
is
very,
very
pervasive.
and
what
we
are
doing
is
requiring
people
under
our
test,
or
even
under
the
agency
law
test...
requiring
people
to
negotiate
up
front
their
contract
so
a
commissioning
party
cannot
come
in
through
the
back
end
after
the
fact
and
say,
"oh,
i
supervised
him
directly.
"
the
artist
says,
"no,
you
didn't".
"yes,
i
did".
and
it's
this
hijack
the
copyright
at
the
end.
they
have
negotiate.
the
commission
party,
the
businesses
have
to
go
to
the
creators
and
say
up
front
this
is
what
we
want
and
this
is
what
we
will
pay.
and
you
do
not
allow
this
back
door
hijacking.
mr.
joshua
kaufman
and
so
he
should
have
if
that
was
his
intent.
the
burden
is
on
the
people,
the
commissioning
parties
under
the
copyright
law...
and
the
'76
act
is
replete
where
the
leveling
of
the
playing
field
is
recognized,
where
the
artist
and
the
creators
have
been
at
a
disadvantage.
mr.
joshua
kaufman
yes.
and
if
you
want
to
obtain
a
copyright,
if
you
want
to
obtain
the
rights...
the
rights
that
you
want
to
obtain
from
a
creator
must
be
negotiated
up
front,
not
after
the
fact.
it
cannot
be...
you
cannot
make
an
independent
contractor,
unknown
to
himself,
inadvertently
an
employee,
which
is
what
they're
test
will
allow.
and
that,
i
propose--
mr.
joshua
kaufman
--there
are
provisions
for
that.
however,
under
this
direction
and
supervision
test,
you
could
even
have
a
situation
where
a
salaried
employee,
if
he
was
not
directed
and
supervised
by
his
employer
might
be
able
to
claim,
"well,
i
wasn't
directed
and
supervised.
"
"that's
the
standard.
"
"it's
mine.
"
even
though
it
was
created
in
the
scope
of
employment.
and
we
think
that's
an
absurd
result,
but
it
is
a
result
that
can
occur
under
the
aldon
test,
not
under
the
other
tests.
the
aldon
test
doesn't
work.
the
other
two
tests
do
work
and
we
think
the
dumas
test
is
the
most
predictable
of
all
of
the
tests
and
is
the
most
in
sync
with
the
legislative
history
and
is
the
one
that
we
hope
that
the
court
adopts.
thank
you
very
much.
