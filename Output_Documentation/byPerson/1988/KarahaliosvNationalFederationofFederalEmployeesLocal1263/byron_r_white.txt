justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
the
general
counsel
issues
a
complaint
and
then
there's
a...
there
is
a
provision
for
an
administrative
hearing
on
unfair
representation.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
congress
certainly
anticipated
that
there
would
be
an
administrative
remedy.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
what
would
happen
if
there
was
an
administrative
proceeding
on
an
unfair...
and
there's
a
ruling
that
there
wasn't
any
unfair
representation?
can
you
go
to
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
could
you
go
to
court
in
my...
in
my
question?
could
you
go
to
court
after
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you...
yes.
would
you
just
then
go
up
on
appeal,
or
would
you
start
all
over
in
the
federal
district
court
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you...
you
still
have
to
be
implying
a
cause
of
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
no
express
provision
for
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
but
they...
but
any
complaint
against
a
union
made
administrative
could...
could
just
be
stopped
dead
in
the
water
by
the
general
counsel.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
court,
made
quite
a
bit.
about
that
in
vaca,
didn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
such
as
any
equivalent
to
section
301.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
the
administrative
remedy
is
not
only
comprehensive,
but
adequate
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
kind
of...
what
kind
of--
justice
byron
r.
white
--against
whom?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
the...
can
the...
can
the
authority
order
the
union
to
pay
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
back
pay
normally
runs
against
the
employer.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
think--
justice
byron
r.
white
--the
administrative
remedy
would
include
any
remedy
that
might...
a
court
might
give.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
the
reverse
argument
would
be
true,
that
if
you
want
one
place
to
settle...
to
settle
a
claim
against
the
employer
and
the
union,
you
ought
to
do
it
where
you
can
get
the
employer.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the...
under...
under
the
federal
law
in
the
federal
sector,
is
the
violation
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation...
is
that
an
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
the
statute
say
in
giving...
in...
in
putting
it...
it
expressly
puts
a
duty
on
the
union,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
doesn't
say
expressly
that
it's
an
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the...
the...
the
board
has
held
that
it
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
byron
r.
white
has
that
been
subject
to
judicial
review?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
it
is
subject
to...
to
judicial
review...
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
its
decision
in
any
fair
representation--
justice
byron
r.
white
--case
is
subject
to
judicial
review.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
affirmed...
affirmed
the
authority?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
didn't
disagree
with
the
notion
that
it
was
an
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
most
unfair
representation
cases,
aren't
you
really
complaining
about
the
union's
failure
to...
to
take
his
case
against
the...
against
the
employer?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you're
not
about
to
win
an
unfair
labor...
unfair
representation
case
unless
you
prove
that
the
employer
was
at
fault,
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
example--
justice
byron
r.
white
--[inaudible]
something
in
this
case
about
that.
