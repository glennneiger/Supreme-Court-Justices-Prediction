mr.
h.
stephan
gordon
mr.
chief
justices
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case
the
court
is
once
again
called
upon
to
decide
whether
a
private
remedy
is
implicit
in
a
statute
which
does
not
expressly
provide
for
it.
and
in
recent
years,
but
starting
long
before
the
enactment
of
the
civil
service
reform
act,
this
court
has
held
in
a
considerable
body
of
case
law
that
the
creation
of
an
implied
private
cause
of
action
to
enforce
a
particular
statute...
a
statutory
duty
is
the
function
of
the
congress
and
not
of
the
court,
and
that
the
ultimate
issue
before
the
court
in
deciding
this
issue
is
whether
the
congress
did,
in
fact,
intend
to
create
such
a
private
right.
to
discern
this
congressional
intent,
the
court
has
said
it
will
look
to
the
language
of
the
statute,
the
structure
of
the
statute,
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute.
and
unless
a
congressional
intent
can
be
discerned
from
these
factors
or
from
some
other
relevant
source,
the
essential
predicate
for
implying
a
private
remedy
simply
does
not
exist.
the
petitioner
asserts
in
his
brief
that
the
court's
task
in
ascertaining
this
matter
in
this
case
is
simplified
because
the
congress
modeled
the
civil
service
reform
act
on
the
labor
management
relations
act
in
the
private
sector,
where
the
court
long
ago
fashioned
a
private
remedy
for
the
judicially
developed
doctrine
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
and
petitioner
asserts
that
congress,
therefore,
must
be
held
to
have
incorporated
this
private
cause
of
action
into
title
vii
of
the
civil
service
reform
act.
this
argument,
i
respectfully
submit,
is
misdirected.
i
think
from
the
outset
it
must
be
emphasized
that
the
civil
service
reform
act
is
not
an
extension
of
the
labor
management
relations
act.
it
is,
indeed,
a
new
law
designed
to
regulate
for
the
first
time
labor-management
relations
in
the
federal
government,
labor-management
relations,
incidentally,
with
problems
and
issues
which
are
unique
unto
themselves
and
which
differ
materially
from
those
to
be
found
in
the
private
sector
and
particularly
wherein
the
role
of
the
union
is
far
more
circumscribed
than
the
role
of
labor
organizations
in
the
private
sector.
and
moreover,
while
the
labor
management
relations
act
may
well
have
acted
as
a
backdrop
to
the
enactment
of
the
civil
service
reform
act,
the
civil
service
reform
act
is
far
more
closely
related
to
the
executive
orders
which
governed
labor-management
relations
in
the
federal
government
for
18
years
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
civil
service
reform
act.
and,
indeed,
the
language
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
which
is
at
issue
here
is
taken
almost
in
haec
verba
from
the
executive
order.
indeed,
if
the
civil
service
reform
act
is
related
to
anything,
it
is
a
codification
of
the
executive
orders
rather
than
the
labor
management
relations
act.
mr.
h.
stephan
gordon
thank
you,
justice
scalia.
[laughter]
now,
with
respect
to
the
language
and
structure
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
civil
service
reform
act,
the
act
differs
materially
from
the
labor
management
relations
act,
and
while
there
are
certainly
some
similarities
between
the
two
acts,
the
differences
far
outweigh
the
similarities.
but
with
respect
to
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
which
is
the
issue
before
the
court
today,
this
difference
is
particularly
cognizable.
thus,
unlike
in
the
private
sector,
the
congress
here
expressly
treated
with
a
duty
of
fair
representation,
which
was
never
done
in
the
private
sector.
and
it
did
so
by
expressly
codifying
the
duty
into
the
statute.
and
moreover,
even
more
importantly,
it
expressly
provided
an
administrative...
administrative
enforcement
scheme
including
an
effective
remedy
for
the
breach
of
such
duty.
mr.
h.
stephan
gordon
that
is
correct,
justice
white.
that
is
true
of
many
aspects--
mr.
h.
stephan
gordon
--that
is
correct,
justice
white.
the
court
did
speak
to
this
issue
in
vaca.
but
this
issue
was
one
of
several
which
the
court
considered
in
vaca
and
why
it
maintained
the
private
cause
of
action
in
vaca.
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
other
factors
on
which
the
court
relied
in
vaca,
which
may
have
been
equally
and
even
more
important
to
the
court
at
the
time,
are
not
present
in
the
civil
service
reform
act....
mr.
h.
stephan
gordon
what
is
one
of
them,
your
honor,
yes.
the
absence
of
the
301
section,
yes,
is
certainly
one
of
the
considerations
and
a
consideration
which
the
court
took
into
great
consideration
in...
in
vaca.
and
i,
i
respectfully
submit,
justice
white,
that
if
there
is
only
one
leg
of
vaca
remaining,
namely,
the
unreviewable
power
of
the
general
counsel
to
dismiss
charges
and
not
issue
complaints,
that
this
would
not
warrant
an
inference
that
congress
intended
to
create
a
private
cause
of
action
when
the
remainder
of
the
statute
makes
it
so
eminently
clear
that
congress,
indeed,
wanted
to
limit
the...
the
role
of
the
judiciary
in
this
respect.
i
think
what
the
congress
has
done
here
is
that
it
picked
up
the
very
pieces
that
were
missing
in
the
private
sector
in
steele
and
in
syres,
and
it
injected
them
into
this
statute
in
order
to
prevent
and
foreclose
the
necessity
of
judicial...
of
a
judicial
private
cause
of
action.
nor
is
the
language
of
the
structure
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
uninformative
regarding
judicial
involvement.
quite
to
the
contrary.
the...
section
7123
very
specifically
limits
the
courts'
intervention
to
three
instances:
one,
that
an
aggrieved
party...
party
aggrieved
by
a
final
order
of
the
authority
may
petition
in
the
appropriate
circuit
court
for
review
of
the
authority's
final
order.
secondly,
the
authority
itself
may
petition
an
appropriate
circuit
court
for
enforcement
of
its
order.
and
the
district
courts
come
into
play
only
in
one
instance,
namely,
in
the
third
instance
whereupon
the
issuance
of
a
complaint
by
the
general
counsel,
the
authority
may
petition
united
states
district
court
for
temporary
injunctive
relief.
these
are
the
only
instances
in
which
congress
has
provided
any
judicial
intervention
in
the
enforcement
of
the
statute.
and
as
i
said
before,
congress
certainly
was
aware...
congress
certainly
must
have
been
aware
that
the
existence
of
301
in
the
labor
management
relations
act
which
empowered
the
district
courts
to
enforce
labor-management
collective
bargaining
agreements,
that
this
was
an
intensely...
intensely
practical
consideration,
if
i
may
use
the
words
of
vaca,
for
maintaining
a
private
cause
of
action.
and
yet,
the
congress,
when
a
somewhat
similar
provision
was
proposed,
specifically
rejected
it.
moreover,
it
left
it
to
the...
with
the...
not
only
rejected
it,
but
it
transferred
the
duties
which
district
courts
had
under
301
directly
to
the
federal--
labor
relations
authority.
thus,
for
example,
where...
in
the
private
sector
under
301
federal
courts,
of
course,
will
review
arbitration
awards.
when
this
was
proposed
during
the
enactment
of
this
law,
the
congress
rejected
it
and
placed
this
power
into
the
hands
of
the
federal
labor
relations
authority,
indeed,
a
nonreviewable
power.
and
i
am
sure
these
compromises
were
not
accidental.
this
was
not
done
by
any
oversight
by
the
congress.
these...
this
limitation
of
the
judicial
function
was
the
product
of
extensive
debate
and
of
legislative
compromise.
now,
with
respect
to
the
legislative
history,
which
is,
of
course,
another
consideration,
as
i've
mentioned,
which
the
board...
which
the
court
will
take
into
consideration,
i
must
agree
with
my
brother
that
there
is,
indeed,
a
paucity
of
legislative
history
which
is
directed
directly
to
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
and
petitioner
asserts
that
this
very
paucity
leads
to
the
inference
that
congress
must
have
intended
to
include
the
private
cause
of
action
which
is
prevalent
in
the
private
sector
under
the
judicially
developed
doctrine.
again,
i
think
this
kind
of
an
argument
is
misplaced
because
the
legislative
history
certainly
is
not
silent
regarding
the
way
this
act
is
meant
to
be
administered.
it...
the
legislative
history
may
be
sparse
with
respect
to
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
but
it
is
quite
specific
regarding
the
administration
and
the
enforcement
scheme
of
the
statute
itself.
i've
already
spoken,
of
course,
to
the
legislative
compromise
regarding
the
limited
judicial
involvement.
and
in
this
context,
the
house
report
specifically
said
that
it
is
the
federal
labor
relations
authority
which
shall
make
the
final
decision
regarding
the
issuance
of
unfair
labor
practice
complaints.
and
the
only
matters
specifically
referred
to
in
section
7123,
which
i
just
mentioned,
shall
be
judicially
reviewable.
similarly,
the
senate
report
also
said
that
all
complaints
of
unfair
labor
practices
that
cannot
be
resolved
by
the
parties
shall
be
filed
with
the
flra.
and
the
conference
committee
which
rejected
the...
which
rejected
the
proposal
to
include
a
similar...
a...
a...
a
clause
somewhat
similar
to
section
301
also
said
that
these
matters
shall
come
to
the...
for
the
consideration
first
of
the
flra.
in
the
face
of
this
congressional
intent
to
create
a
comprehensive
and
administrative
enforcement
scheme,
i
submit
it
is
difficult,
indeed,
to
attribute
to
the
congress
an
intent
to
incorporate
by
silence
a
private
cause
of
action.
mr.
h.
stephan
gordon
yes,
i
believe,
justice
white,
it
is
adequate--
mr.
h.
stephan
gordon
--since
the...
since
section
7118
specifically
provides
that
the
authority
is
authorized
to
issue
back
pay
orders,
for
example,
where
back
pay
is
indicated.
mr.
h.
stephan
gordon
well,
the...
the...
the
authority
has
broad
remedial
powers
which
i
submit
are
quite
adequate
and
which
the
authority
has
exercised.
mr.
h.
stephan
gordon
yes.
yes,
it
may.
mr.
h.
stephan
gordon
whatever...
whatever
damages
the
authority
will
seek.
there
could
be
back
pay,
for
example.
mr.
h.
stephan
gordon
well,
under
vaca
v.
sipes,
it
runs
to
the
employer,
but
since
vaca
and
bowen,
the...
the
court
has
extended
this
so
that
unions
have
become
equally
liable
to
pay
back
pay--
mr.
h.
stephan
gordon
--the
court--
mr.
h.
stephan
gordon
--well,
it
would
certainly
not
include
punitive
damages,
for
example,
since
the
authority
would
not
be
authorized
to
issue
any
orders
which...
which
are
punitive
in
nature.
but
in
all
other
respects,
the
authority
has
very
broad
authority,
if
i
may
use
that
term,
to
fashion
adequate
remedies.
and
in
the
light
of
this,
as
i
say,
it...
it
is
very
difficult
to
attribute
to
the
congress
an
intent,
to
incorporate
by
silence
a
private
cause
of
action.
indeed,
the
result
of
this
would
be
that
an
individual
employee
could
completely
bypass
not
only
the
substantive
and
procedural
provisions
of
the
act,
but
also
he
could
bypass
the
very
agency
which
the
congress
has
created
to
administer
this
act.
and
in
the
light
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
as
recently
as
a
year
ago
in
u.s.
v.
fausto
and
even
as
recently
as
six
months
ago
in
schweiker
v.
chiilkee
where...
wherein
the
court
reaffirmed
its
holding
in
bush
v.
lucus,
i...
i
submit
that
such
a
remedy
could
not
be
implied.
in
conclusion,
i
only
want
to
say
that
as
in
the
private
sector,
the
duty
of
fair
representation
is
alive
and
well
in
the
federal
sector
and
serves
in
the
words
of
vaca
v.
sipes
as
a
bulwark
to
prevent
arbitrary
union
conduct.
however,
the
injection
of
a
private
cause
of
action
to
enforce
the
duty
would,
indeed,
circumvent
the
congressional
intent
to
create
a
comprehensive
and
integrated
administrative
enforcement
remedial
scheme
and
might
well
create
the
duplication
of
litigation
and
inconsistent
remedies
which
the
congress
intended
to
avoid
and
which
this
court
has
cautioned
against.
if
there
are
no
other...
and
i
believe
that
the
holding
of
the
court
below
should
be
affirmed.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
this
concludes
my
arguments
mr.
chief
justice.
