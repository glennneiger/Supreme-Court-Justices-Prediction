mr.
thomas
r.
duffy
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
the
court
this
morning
in
this
case
is
whether
a
federal
employee
who
has
been
injured
by
his
union's
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
may
bring
an
action
to
redress
those
injuries
in
district
court
or,
put
another
way,
whether
congress
intended
a
union
operating
in
the
federal
sector
to
receive
immunity,
complete
immunity,
from
such
lawsuits,
an
immunity
which
has
never
been
permitted
in
any
other
national
labor
relations
statute.
it
is
our
view
that
the
congressional
grant
of
exclusive
representation
powers
to
the
union
in
the
federal
sector,
coupled
with
the
unreviewable
discretion
of
the
general
counsel
of
the
flra
here,
mandate
jurisdiction,
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
in
the
district
court
just
as
exactly
those
same
factors
compelled
jurisdiction
in
this
court's
decision
in
vaca
v.
sipes
20
years
ago.
mr.
thomas
r.
duffy
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
r.
duffy
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and--
mr.
thomas
r.
duffy
--i
think
that's
exactly
the
wrong
which
was
addressed
by
the
court
in
vaca
v.
sipes.
the
problem
is
in
the
focus
which
the
administrative
remedy
has
and
the
strength
of--
mr.
thomas
r.
duffy
--in
the
private
sector,
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
r.
duffy
as
it's
currently
structured,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
you
can
go
to
district
court.
i
believe
that's
the
doctrine
announced...
enunciated
by
the
court
in
vaca
v.
sipes.
and
i
think
that
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
court
recognized
in
vaca
that
the
administrative
remedies...
the
focus
which
the
administrative
agency
has
in
fashioning
remedies,
even
given
an
unfair
labor
practice
finding,
is
a
remedy
which
isn't
necessarily
suited
to
redress
the
wrongs
done
to
the
individual
employee.
for
example...
and
the
facts
here
i
think
provide
a
cogent
demonstration
of
that.
here
the
administrative
remedy
fashioned
by
the
agency,
by
the
authority's
general
counsel,
in
reaching
a
settlement,
a
settlement
reached,
it
bears
noting,
over
the
objection
of
the
charging
party,
over
the
objection
of
the
injured
employee...
the
administrative
remedy
reached
here
was
to
achieve
a
settlement
with
the
union
which
required
the
union
to
post
a
notice
on
its
bulletin
board
saying
we're
not
going
to
repeat
the
conduct
which
was
wrongful.
and
that
administrative
remedy
may
well
have
been
furthering
the
institutional
goals
of
the
federal
labor
relations
authority,
as
similar
notice-posting
remedies
further
the
institutional
goals
which
the
nlrb
has
in
the
private
sector.
and
the
problem
addressed
by
the
court
in
vaca
is
that
that
administrative
remedy,
given
the
strength
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
doctrine...
that
administrative
remedy
does
not
provide
any
relief...
that
administrative
focus
does
not
provide
any
relief
for
the
injured
employee
who
is
wronged
by
his
union.
we
believe
that
the--
mr.
thomas
r.
duffy
--in
the
vaca
v.
sipes
case.
mr.
thomas
r.
duffy
it
was
an
open
question
in
vaca
whether
or
not
the
availability
of
unfair
labor
practice
review
was
sufficient
to
allow
preemption
of
a
judicial
remedy.
mr.
thomas
r.
duffy
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
duffy
well,
i'm
not
certain
that
that...
that's
actually
the
case
here.
here
i
think
we're
working
in
a
very
similar
setting.
in
the
private
sector
when
vaca
was
decided,
we
had
a
judicial
remedy
well
recognized
in
steele
and
tunstall,
in...
in
that
line
of
cases.
nevertheless,
after
vaca
we
have
a
setting
where
we
have
an
administrative
remedy
and
a
concurrent
judicial
remedy.
and
i
think
that's
the
contextual
setting
in
which
congress
was
passing
the
csra
here,
and
that's
what
congress
was
looking
to
when
it
said
it
wanted
to
make
federal
sector
labor
relations
more
like
the
private
sector.
in
other
words--
mr.
thomas
r.
duffy
--well,
the
judicial
remedy
was
established
in
steele
and
tunstall
some
20
years
before
the...
the
vaca
remedy.
mr.
thomas
r.
duffy
that's
correct.
the
board
decided
that...
that
duty
of
fair
representation
cases
would
be
prosecuted
as
unfair,
labor
practices
in
miranda
fuel
in
1962.
but
what
we
have
here
is
a
setting
where
these
cases,
vaca
v.
sipes,
and
its
progeny,
bowen,
foust,
mitchell...
these
cases
are
some
of
the
absolute,
fundamental
principles
that
we
see
in
our
scheme
of
private
sector
labor
law.
and
it's
our
position
that,
with
these
principles
in
mind
and
with
the
acknowledged
legislative
statement
that
congress
was
attempting
to
fashion
a
federal
sector
labor
relations
setting
in
the
civil
service
reform
act
which
more
closely
approximated
private
sector
collective
bargaining,
since
the
principles
in
vaca
lie
at
the...
at
the
absolute
base
of
private
sector
collective
bargaining,
that
congress
must
have
intended
these
principles
to
apply
also
in
the
civil
service
reform
act.
mr.
thomas
r.
duffy
well,
i
think
that--
mr.
thomas
r.
duffy
--well,
there's...
there's
no
question
that
it's
not
set
forth
in
the
statute,
justice
white.
and
i
think
that
the
appropriate
analysis
here
though
is
not
the
touche
ross
analysis.
here
we're
working
in
a
setting,
where
congress
tells
us
in
the
legislative
history
the
objective
that
we're
working
towards
is
a
private
sector
model.
true,
it
has
some
public
sector
management
differences.
but
what
we
want
to
do
is
we
want
to
achieve
a
private
sector
model.
we
want
to
achieve
a
more
efficient
way
to
handle
our
various
employee
grievances,
and
we
believe
that
efficiency
can
be
achieved
through...
through
channeling
those
grievances
through
the
grievance
and
arbitration
mechanism.
mr.
thomas
r.
duffy
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
thomas
r.
duffy
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
the
national
labor
relations
act
had
no
provision
for
district
court
jurisdiction
over
duty
of
fair
representation
actions.
mr.
thomas
r.
duffy
certainly
in
the
notional
labor
relations
act,
there
was.
in
the
rla,
no,
that's
not
the
case.
there's
not
the
corresponding
nlrb
counterpart
and
unfair
labor
practice
counterpart.
and...
and
perhaps
the
better
model
to
look
at
here
or
the
closer
model
to
look
at
here
is
the
national
labor
relations
board.
and,
indeed,
the
congressional
history
tells
us
to
look
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
to
determine
what
the
federal
labor
relations
authority
is
all
about.
there's
express
congressional
history,
which
we
cited
in
our
brief
both
from
the
house
and
from
the
senate
indicating
that
the
role
of
the
federal
labor
relations
authority,
and
in
particular
the
role
of
the
general
counsel
in
the
authority,
is
to
be
modeled
after
the
private
sector
national
labor
relations
model.
and
it's
our
view
that
that
model,
the
private
sector
model,
which
grants
two
things
which
are
particularly
troubling
in
this
situation...
first
it
grants
exclusive
representational
powers
to
the
union.
the
union...
the
majority
representative
has
exclusive
access
to
the
bargaining
mechanism,
which
may
be
less
significant
in
the
federal
sector,
but
it
has
the
same
access,
exclusive
access,
to
the
arbitration
mechanism
which
is
so
very
troubling
in
a
case
like
this.
should
the
union
decide
for
arbitrary,
bad
faith
or
discriminatory
reasons
not
to
take
a
case
to
arbitration,
what
remedy
does
the
employee
have?
and
is
the
administrative
focus
of
the
institution
with
the...
the
flra,
that
is...
with
the
institutional
goals
which
it
has
in
fashioning
unit-wide
remedies,
as
opposed
to
individual
remedies...
is
that
institutional
focus
sufficient
to
allow
us
to
say
that
the
duty
of
fair
representation
in
the
federal
sector
is
less
significant
and
less
worthy
of
protection
than
in
the
private
sector?
it's
our
feeling
that
had
congress
wanted
to
depart
from
the
principles
of
vaca,
the
reasonable
thing
for
congress
to
have
done
would
be
to
say
something
about
it.
the
legislative
history
is
actually...
is
absolutely
bereft
of
any
mention
that
congress
wished
to
fashion
different
rules
in
this
setting.
moreover,
the
legislative
history
is
ripe
with
mention
of
the
things
that
congress
wished
to
change,
places
where
it
wished
to
depart
from
the
national
labor
relations
model.
and
those
are
clearly
set
forth
in
the
management
rights
provisions
and
so
forth.
but
here--
mr.
thomas
r.
duffy
--well,
surely,
your
honor--
mr.
thomas
r.
duffy
--with
a
great
deal
of
specificity.
surely,
we'd
look
to
the
language
of
the
statute
first.
my
point
here
is,
of
course,
there
is
no
statutory
discussion--
mr.
thomas
r.
duffy
--that
may
well
be
the
case,
your
honor.
however,
i
don't
think
where
we
have
no
indication
in
the
statute
that
congress
wished
to
depart
from
the
principles
in
vaca,
then
we
look
to
the
legislative
history,
and
what
does
the
legislative
history
tell
us?
the
legislative
history
tells
us
nothing
about
vaca,
no
indication
that...
there's
no
indication
in
the
legislative
history...
in
fact,
there's
an
implication
to
the
contrary...
that
the
role
of
the
flra
and
the
role
of
the
flra
general
counsel
is
to
be
modeled
after
the
nlrb.
surely,
if
congress
wanted
us
to
change
from
that
model
in
this
significant
respect,
given
the
number
of
decisions
of
this
court
enforcing
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
there
would
have
been
some
discussion
in
the
legislative
history
describing
the
role
of
the
national...
of
the
flra
sayings
look,
we
intend
the
flra
to
have
greater
jurisdiction
or
exclusive
jurisdiction.
we
intend
to
depart
from
the
principles
enunciated
in
vaca,
and
that
didn't
happen
here.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
my
time.
mr.
thomas
r.
duffy
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
point
made
by
the
solicitor
general's
office
is
that...
and
by
the
union
is
that
the
role...
the
role
of
the
union
may
well
be
circumscribed
somewhat
in
the
federal
labor
relations
scheme.
that
role...
the
critical
difference
is
that
that
role
has
to
do
with
the
union's
relationship
with
the
employing
agency.
the
union,
as
i
think
everyone
recognizes,
has
less
power
than
in
the
private
sector
with
regard
to
certain
issues
of
bargaining
which
would
normally
be
reserved
in
the
private
sector
for
the
adversarial
parties.
what
the
union's
argument
ignores
are
what
we
feel
are
the
crucial
similarities
between
the
statute
and
those
are
the
similarities
which
we
believe
are
the
underpinning
of
the
court's
decision
in
vaca.
and
those
similarities
again:
exclusive
representation
and
unreviewable
discretion
of
the
general
counsel.
the
fact
that
there's
not
a
section
301
direct
analogue
or
analogue
of
any
sort
in
the
civil
service
reform
act
is
not,
we
believe...
doesn't
advance
the
inquiry
before
the
court
significantly.
and
the
reason
for
that
is,
after
vaca,
the
court
has
recognized
in
delcostello
that
the
basis
for
the
duty
of
fair
representation
is
not
section
301,
but
the
need
for
the
duty
of
fair
representation
is
implied
from
the
structure
of
the
entire
collective
bargaining
framework,
which
grants
such
exclusive
powers
to
the
majority
representative,
even
over
the
most
unwilling
minority,
grants
exclusive
access
to
the
arbitration
mechanisms
and
may
not
have
an
adequate
administrative
remedy
through
the
flra
or
the
nlrb.
and
those
we
think
are
the...
the
underpinnings
of
the
vaca
decision.
the
duty
of
fair
representation
is
implied
as
a
necessary
implication
once
those
sorts
of
powers
are
granted
to
a
majority
representative.
we
have
to
put
something
in
the
system
that
assures
that
there
will
be
an
adequate
remedy
when
the
majority
representative
abuses
its
power
or
abdicates
its
position
as
the
representative,
which
happened
here
below
when
the
union
told
the
employee
we're
not
going
to
consider
the
merits
of
your
arbitration
because
we're
bound
by
what
we
did
in
our
previous
arbitration.
there's
no
indication
in
passing
the
csra
that
congress
evinced
any
more
or
any
reluctance
to
have
judicial
review
of
flra
actions
than
of
nlrb
actions
in
the
national
labor
relations
act.
section
7123,
with
the
exception
regarding
arbitrability,
is
essentially
what
we
have
in
section
10.
we
have
appellate
court
review
in
the...
in
the
federal
circuit
courts
of
appeal
for
those
sorts
of
activities.
even
the
exception
with
regard
to
arbitrability,
going
in
the
first
instance
to
the
flra...
even
that
exception
is
not
the
case
where
we
have
unfair
labor
practices,
and
those
are
reviewable
just
as
they
are
reviewable
in
the
private
sector
model.
so,
there's
no
indication
from
the
legislative
history
that
congress
was
dissatisfied
with
the
national
labor
relations
system
or
wanted
less
judicial
review
than
what
we
have
long
experience
with
in
the...
in
the
private
sector.
the
union
makes
the
point
that
the
federal
labor
relations
authority
has
broad
remedial
powers
which
may
well
include
back
pay.
we...
i
think
that
everyone
recognizes
that
the
authority,
in
fact,
does
have
broad
remedial
powers.
it
has
broad
remedial
powers
which
parallel
the
nlrb,
and
those
same
broad
remedial
powers
are
what
the
court
was
looking
at
in
vaca
v.
sipes.
and
i
think
that
the
problem
which
vaca
recognizes
is
that
it's
not
the
existence
of
the
remedy
that's
in
question.
it's
the
application
of
the
remedy
and
the
access
to
the
remedy.
if
the
individual
employee
who
has
been
injured
by
his
union's
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
through
actions,
unreviewable
actions,
of
the
general
counsel's
office
can't
get
into
the
system
where
he
has
those
sorts
of
remedies
available
to
him,
then
the
system
doesn't
work
very
well.
and
it's
that
wrong
about
which
we
believe
justice
white
was
writing
in
vaca
v.
sipes
when
he
wrote
that
the
existence
of
even
a
small
group
of
cases
in
which
the
union
would
be
unwilling
or
unable
to
remedy
the
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
would
frustrate
the
very
purposes
of
the
duty.
the
solicitor
general's
office
suggests
that
there
is
a
danger
here
of
inconsistent
results
that
you
might
have
a
different...
a
different
result
before
the
flra
than
possibly
before
the...
the
courts,
and
that
the
flra
ought
to
be
given
the
primacy
for
developing
the
duty
of
fair
representation
in
this
area.
i...
i...
i
think
that,
first
of
all,
it
doesn't
recognize
that
the
duty
of
fair
representation...
the
contours
of
that
duty
have
been
well
developed
for
over
40
years
of
federal
court
jurisprudence
since
steele.
we
know
what
the
duty
of
fair
representation
is.
the
authority,
in
fact,
looks
to
the
private
sector
duty
of
fair
representation,
and
well
it
should.
we
have
the...
the
law
library
is
full
of
examples
upon
which
it
may
draw
to
determine
what
is
a
preach
of
the
duty
and
what
remedies
are
appropriate.
so,
we
believe
that
far
from
reaching
inconsistent
results,
that
the
authority
will,
in
fact,
look
to
the
private
sector
law
and
should,
in
fact,
look
to
the
private
sector
law
to
determine
the
contours
of
the
duty.
mr.
thomas
r.
duffy
the
federal
labor
relations
authority
has
taken
the
position
that
it
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
one
of
the
things--
mr.
thomas
r.
duffy
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
duffy
no.
interestingly
enough,
the
statute...
if...
the
statute
doesn't
say
anything
at
all
about
whether
or
not
the
duty
of
fair
representation
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
that's
no
more
clear
than
it
is
in
the
private
sector.
mr.
thomas
r.
duffy
the
authority
has
taken
the
position,
much
like
the
national
labor
relations
board--
mr.
thomas
r.
duffy
--i--
mr.
thomas
r.
duffy
--yes,
it
is
subject
to
judicial
review,
and
i--
mr.
thomas
r.
duffy
--yes.
mr.
thomas
r.
duffy
that,
would
be
reviewable
in
the
courts
of
appeal--
mr.
thomas
r.
duffy
--much
like
in
the
national
labor
relations
act.
and
to
answer
your
question,
yes,
that
question
has
been
addressed
in
judge
bork's
decision
in
the
national...
the
nteu
v.
flra
case
cited
in
our
brief
at
800
f.
2d.
mr.
thomas
r.
duffy
yes,
it
affirmed
the
authority.
i'm
not
certain
that
it...
no,
it
did
not
affirm
the
authority.
it
reversed
the
authority
because
what
it
held
was
that
the
authority
was
attempting
to
impose
a
broader
duty
of
fair
representation
with
regard
to
that
particular
issue,
and
it,
said,
no,
you've
got
to
go
with
the
[inaudible]
private
sector
duty--
mr.
thomas
r.
duffy
--it
did
not
disagree
with
the
notion
that
it
was
an
unfair
labor
practice.
judge
bork
felt
that
the
language
of
7114,
in
which
the
duty
of
fair
representation
is
found,
was
sufficient
to
have
the
duty
of
fair
representation
treated
as
an
unfair
labor
practice.
interestingly
enough,
though,
the
fact
that
congress
did
not
specifically
provide
a
remedy
for
duty
of
fair
representation
breaches
as
unfair
labor
practices
is
further...
a
further
indication,
we
feel,
that
congress
intended
no
different
result
here
in
the
csra
context
than
in
the
flra
context.
certainly,
this
was
an
opportunity
when
congress
went
through
and
enumerated
the
list
of
unfair
labor
practices
in...
in
the
civil
service
reform
act,
it
had
an
opportunity
to
say
one
of
those
enumerated
practices
is
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
and,
in
fact,
it
didn't.
the
only
reason
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
has
found
that
is
that
there
is
a
catch-all
provision
in
the
unfair
labor
practice
provisions
under
the
civil
service
reform
act,
and
the
duty
of
fair
representation
has
been
treated
as
part
of
that
catch-all
jurisdiction.
but
there's
certainly
no
specific
legislative
indication
that
congress
wished
to...
wished
a
specific
unfair
labor
practice
remedy
which
was
somehow
different
than
in
the
private
sector.
mr.
thomas
r.
duffy
i
think
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
i
don't...
i
might
be
wrong,
but
i
don't
believe
that
the
flra
has
taken
the
position
in
any
of
the
cases
of
which
i'm
aware
that
there
is
no
duty
of
fair
representation...
unfair
labor
practice
jurisdiction.
i...
in
facts,
i
think
quite
the
contrary
is
true.
one
of
the
assertions,
one
of
the
arguments,
by
the
solicitor
general's
office
is
that
the
federal
labor
relations
authority
will
somehow
develop
greater
expertise
through
its
determination
of
arbitrability
than
the
courts,
and
that
therefore
we
should
give
such
questions
solely
to
the
flra
where
the
duty
of
fair
representation
is
concerned.
i
think
that
that
argument
has
an
essential
fallacy
as
a
premise.
and
the...
the
fallacy
is
that
only
employer...
only
duty
of
fair
representation
breaches
will
come
up
where
employer
conduct
is
implicated.
and
that's
certainly
not
the
cases,
nor
was
it
the
case
in
two
out
of
the
three
breaches
of
duty
of
fair
representation
here
where
the
union
acting
by
itself,
totally
without
regard
to
employer
conduct,
breached
its
duty
of
fair
representation.
and
with
regard
to
those
issues,
we're
not
involved
with
contract
administration
whatsoever.
with
regard
to
those
issues,
we're
involved
with
the
basic
substantive
duty
of
fair
representation
law.
was
the
union
discriminating
against
this
employee?
and
again,
here
below,
two
out
of
three
cases,
the...
the
union
was
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
r.
duffy
certainly
i
think
that
the
bulk
of
such
cases
are
contract
breach
cases.
mr.
thomas
r.
duffy
i
think
that's
a
necessary
corollary--
mr.
thomas
r.
duffy
--in
the
breach
of
contract
cases.
it's
certainly
not
a
necessary
corollary
or
even
part
of
the
analysis
in
situations
where
the
duty
of
fair
representation
doesn't
have
any
employer
conduct
implications
whatsoever.
mr.
thomas
r.
duffy
xxx--
mr.
thomas
r.
duffy
--oh,
in
this
case?
in
this
case,
the
union
decided
to
arbitrate
for
another
employee,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
this
employee
petitioner
had...
who
had
been
employed
for
almost
20
years
by
the
federal
government
had
been
functioning
in
this
job.
the
union
decided
to
arbitrate
for
the
other
employee
without
any
consideration
of
petitioner's
merits
whatsoever,
and
in
so
doing,
held
the
district
court,
breached
its
duty
of
fair
representation.
a
second
example
of
that
was
when
the
union
went
to
arbitration
on
behalf
of
the
other
employee.
when
the
union
went
to
arbitration
on
behalf
of
the
other
employee,
it
provided
no
notice
that
there
was
an
arbitration
going
on
over
petitioner's
job.
it
provided
no
opportunity
for
him
to
be
heard,
and
it
failed
to
present
any
of
his
views
to
the
arbitrator.
no
employer
conduct
involved
whatsoever
there.
yet,
nevertheless,
the
union
had
failed
and
we
believe
failed
abjectly
in
its
duty
of
fair
representation.
in
summary,
we
believe
that
the...
the
grant
here
of
the
powers
which
lie
at
the
heart
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
the
grant
of
exclusive
representational
powers,
the
grant
of...
of
majority
rule,
the
grant
of
exclusive
access
to
the
grievance
and
arbitration
mechanisms,
to
the
union
necessarily
compel
district
court
subject
matter
jurisdiction
to
provide
a
judicial
forum
for
employees
who
are
injured
by
their
duty
of...
by
the
union's
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
just
as
in
the
private
sector.
there
are
no
salient
differences
between
the
private
sector
model
and
the
public
sector
model
which
congress
is
intending
to
create.
congress
directed
us
to
look
to
the
private
sector
model
when
it
was
fashioning
this
system.
i
don't
think
there
is
a
departure
here
which
is
warranted.
if
congress
had
wanted
to
change...
if
congress
had
any
dissatisfaction
with
the
court's
ruling
in
vaca,
the...
the...
with
the
essential
premises
in
any
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
cases
under
the
national
labor
relations
structure,
we
would
have
seen
some
congressional
mention
of
that,
i'm
sure,
in
the
20
years
since
vaca.
and
instead,
we've
seen
nothing
to
indicate
that
congress
in
any
way
is
displeased
with
the
necessary
implication
of
a
judicial
forum
where
the
union
has
breached
its
duty
of
fair
representation.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
would
urge
that
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
be
reversed
and
the
case
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
