although
in
that
case
there
had
previously
been...
before
the
administrative
remedy
was
adopted,
there
had
previously
been
judicial
relief
available
though.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
in
that
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
hadn't
the
judicial
remedy
been...
been
available
before
the
administrative
remedy
was
provided?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was...
there
was
no
question
that...
that...
that
you
have
the
judicial
remedy
before
the
administrative
remedy.
so,
the...
the
issue
was
whether
the
furnishing
of
the
administrative
remedy
eliminated
a
judicial
remedy
that
had
previously
been
available.
and
that's
not
the
question
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
fairness
is
not...
it's
not
just
the
legislative
history
that's
rife
with
that.
it's
the
terms
of
the
statute.
you
wouldn't
have
needed
the
legislative
history's
reference
to
those
differences.
justice
antonin
scalia
management's
rights
are
set
forth
in
the
statute
with
some
specificity.
justice
antonin
scalia
my
point
is
that
the
departure
that
the
legislative
history
refers
to...
the
other
departures
that
the
legislative
history
refers
to
are
departures
that
are
contained
in
the
text
of
the
statute.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
must
say
i've
never
heard
a
union
argue
this
before,
but
it's...
it's
an
interesting
[inaudible]
to
hear
from
that
side.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
d.c.
circuit
didn't
make
that
decision
on
its
own.
i
mean,
it
was...
it
was
in...
in
effect,
validating
the
flra's
determination
that
there...
that
there
was
such
a...
a
right.
