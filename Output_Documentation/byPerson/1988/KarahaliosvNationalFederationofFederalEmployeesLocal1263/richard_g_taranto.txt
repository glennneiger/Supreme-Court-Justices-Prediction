mr.
richard
g.
taranto
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
virtually
the
whole
of
petitioner's
case
rests
on
the
assertion
that
just
as
there
is
a
private
right
of
action
for
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
under
the
rla
and
the
nlra,
there
surely
must
also
be
an
implied
right
of
action
under
the
csra
in
the
federal
sector.
like
the
respondent
union,
the
government
believes
that
is
wrong.
i
want
to
summarize
why
we
think
the
evidence
is
simply
not
sufficient
for
petitioners
to
sustain
their
claim
that
the
1978
congress
that
enacted
the
csra
intended
to
authorize
suits
against
unions
for
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
the
principle
factors
that
this
court's
decisions
rely
on
as
counting
against
any
implied
right
of
action
are
present
here.
the
statutory
language
is
duty
imposing
rather
than
right
creating.
the
statute,
far
from
failing
to
address
remedies,
expressly
sets
up
an
elaborate
remedial
scheme.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
legislative
history
of
any
intent
to
create
an
implied
right
of
action,
and
the
legislative
history
in
fact
reflects
a
commitment
of
collective
bargaining
agreement
disputes
to
the
flra
and
not
the
courts.
but
i
want
to
focus
my
argument
on
why
it
is
wrong
to
suggest
that
congress
must
have
meant
to
borrow
the
implied
right
of
action
from
the
nlra,
as
explained
in
vaca
v.
sipes.
to
begin
with,
there
is
no
mention
of
vaca
or
of
any
private
sector
analogue
in
the
statute
or
the
legislative
history.
it
was
from
the
pre-1978
federal
sector
labor
law,
the
executive
order,
that
the
express
provision
imposing
the
duty
of
fair
representation
along
with
the
unfair
labor
practice
remedy
was
taken.
under
the
executive
order.
respondent
had
the
same
duty
of
fair
representation
rights
and
petitioner
had...
and
petitioner
had
the
same
administrative
remedy
as
he
has
here,
though
without
judicial
review.
in
fact,
there
are
also
affirmative
reasons
to
think
that
congress
did
not
intend
the
private
sector
analogy
in
this
setting.
it's
worth
noting
first
that
if
there
was
a
borrowing
from
the
nlra,
it's
significant
that
it
seems
to
have
been
a
very
carefully
limited
borrowing,
because
the
csra
took
the
duty
which
was
only
implied
in
the
private
sector
and
made
it
express,
but
it
didn't
take
the
right
which
was
also
only
implied
under
the
nlra.
but
in
any
event,
the...
the
and
analogy
to
the
nlra
remedial
scheme
simply
does
not
fit
well
with
the
csra
scheme.
the...
the
two
statutes
are
sufficiently
different
in
crucial
respects,
both
substantive
and
remedial,
that
the
rationale
of
this
court's
decision
in
vaca
does
not
carry
over
in
significant
degree
into
the
federal
setting.
first,
in
the
nlra
context,
vaca
noted
the
private
right
of
action
was
found
to
be
implied
in
the
statute
before
there
was
any
administrative
enforcement
mechanism,
and
there
was
no
evidence
of
a
congressional
intent
later
to
preempt
that
judicially
recognized
right.
in
the
flra
context,
the
question
is
not
one
of
congressional
displacement
of
a
preexisting
right
of
action
for
there
was
no
right
of
action
prior
to
1978.
the
question
rather
is
of
congressional
intent
to
create
the
right
of
action.
and
in
the
csra
setting,
the
administrative
enforcement
scheme
was
created
in
the
very
same
act
that
contains
the
duty,
a
key
basis
for
both
vaca
and
steele,
therefore,
namely,
the
absence
of...
of
an
administrative
remedy
is
missing
in
this
setting.
vaca
also
emphasized
a
closely
related
practical
aspect
of
that
point.
most
duty
of
fair
representation
cases
involve
questions
about
labor
contract
negotiating
positions
or
the
handling
of
grievances.
but
vaca
pointed
out
that
those
matters
are
generally
outside
the
jurisdiction
of
the
nlrb
and
therefore
outside
its
expertise.
the
situation
is
quite
different
in
the
federal
sector.
the
flra
does
have
jurisdiction
to
resolve
negotiability
disputes,
and
it
also
has
jurisdiction
to
review
the
arbitration
awards
that
result
from
grievance
procedures.
those
matters,
therefore,
are
already
within
the
authority
of
the
flra;
and
it
makes
good
sense
for
congress
to
have
relied
on
the
agency's
expertise.
vaca
rested
as
well
on
the
idea
that
the
private
right
of
action
serves
as
a
necessary
counterweight
to
the
union's
power
to
strip
employees
of
preexisting
rights
and
forms
of
redress,
but
in
the
federal
sector,
unions
do
not
have
anything
like
that
kind
of
power.
perhaps
most
important,
the
csra
expressly
provides
that
a
labor
contract
cannot
strip
federal
employees
of
their
appeal
rights
under
statute
or
regulation.
in
addition,
while
in
the
private
sector
recognition
of
an
exclusive
bargaining
representative
deprives
individual
employees
of
their
right
to
make
individual
contracts
with
the
employer,
in
the
federal
sector,
most
employees
do
not
lose
any
such
right
because
they
are
not
employed
pursuant
to
contract
in
the
first
place.
they
are
appointed
under
terms
set
by
statute
and
regulation.
and
the
matters
that
are
actually
determined
by
labor
contracts
are
themselves
far
more
limited
in
the
federal
sector.
those
matters
do
not
include
wages,
hours
or
any
of
the
matters
covered
by
certain
regulations
or
the
broad
statutory
management
rights
provision.
finally,
vaca
stressed
that
employee
suits
against
employers
for
breach
of
the...
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
are
already
in
court
under
section
301
of
the
lmra.
and
those
suits
typically
require
as
a
precondition
to
upsetting
the
finality
of
an
arbitration
award
that
the
employee
show
that
the
union
representing
him
breached
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
the
issue,
as
vaca
said,
will
therefore
already
be
resolved
in
court,
and
it
makes
sense
to
ensure
that
relief
can
be
had
against
the
union
for
its
share
of
the
harm.
again,
the
federal
setting
is
entirely
different.
there
is
no
analogue
to
section
301.
instead,
in
the
situation
addressed
by
vaca,
after
compulsory
arbitration,
an
employee
may
challenge
the
arbitral
award
only
before
the
flra,
and
there
is
generally
judicial
review
of
flra
decisions.
thus,
a
private
right
of
action
in
the
federal
sector
cannot
be
supported
as
an
adjunct
to
an
employee/employer
case
that
is
a
already
in
court.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
you...
you
can
get
an
employer
for
unfair
labor
practices
before...
before
the
flra.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
that's
right.
and...
and
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding,
there
would
eventually
be
judicial
review.
in
fact,
recognizing
a
private
right
of
action
would
run
counter
to
the
decision
by
congress
to
keep
collective
bargaining
agreement
disputes
out
of
the
courts,
except
where
they
are
tied
up
with
unfair
labor
practice
questions.
as
delcostello
noted,
most
duty
of
fair
representation
claims
involving
grievances
require
as
a
precondition
to
relief
that
the
employee
show
not
only
that
the
union
breached
the
duty,
but
also
that
the
employer
breached
the
contract.
thus,
if
the
courts
were
to
recognize
the
private
right
of
action
that
petitioner
requests,
other
than
through
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding,
they
would
be
addressing
precisely
the...
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
questions
that
congress
decided
to
keep
out
of
the
courts.
for
those
reasons,
we
think
that
there
is
no
sufficient
reason
to
believe
that
the
1978
congress
intended
to
borrow
the
private
sector
enforcement
scheme
as
a
supplement
to
the
administrative
scheme
it
set
forth
expressly
in
the
statute.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should,
therefore,
be
affirmed.
