mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
it's
important
at
the
outset
to
make
clear
the
nature
and
consequences
of
the
lawsuit
that
petitioners,
or
that
mwd
in
particular,
has
brought
against
the
united
states
here.
they
seek
an
order
to,
a
judicial
order,
setting
aside
the
secretary's
determination
of
the
proper
boundary
of
the
indian
reservation,
and
secondly
request
the
court
to
go
ahead
and
decide
de
novo
where
the
proper
boundary
of
the
reservation
is.
the
effect
of
determining
where
the
boundary
is
is
to
determine
whether
the
land
within
the
boundary
is
held
in
trust
by
the
united
states
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians.
as
a
result,
the
consequence
of
this
lawsuit
with
respect
to
the
land
at
issue
would
be
to
affect
both
the
united
states'
title
and
the
tribe's
title.
the
united
states'
title
would
be
changed
from
fee
simple...
i
mean,
excuse
me...
from
holding
the
land
in
trust
for
the
tribe
to
fee
simply
absolute,
and
the
tribes
equitable
interest
in
the
land
would
be
altogether
extinguished,
which
would
greatly
disrupt
the
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
the
tribe,
which--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes
i,
yes
i
do.
mr.
claiborne
in
the
oral
argument
in
that
case,
when
questioned
about
the
pending
motion
to
dismiss
in
the
district
court,
noted
that
that
had
been,
that
there
was
a
motion
to
dismiss
that
raised
sovereign
immunity
defense,
and
he,
there's
some,
i
think,
ambiguity
in
his
response.
whether
it's
correctly
transcribed
or
not
is
unclear.
but
the
page
of
the
oral
argument
transcript
that
is
reproduced
in
an
appendix
to
the
brief
makes
it
pretty
clear
that
mr.
claiborne
was
contemplating
that
these
issues,
and
particularly
here
sovereign
immunity,
would
be
litigated
in
the
district
court,
and
would
be
subject
to
appellate
review.
and
that
was
apparently
this
court's
understanding
because
they
did
not,
the
court's
opinion
in
arizona
against
california
did
not
take
the
united
states
to
have
conceded
the
absence
of,
or
the
presence
of
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court.
and
in
fact
the
court's
opinion
went
on
to
acknowledge
that
the
question
of
sovereign
immunity
among
others
would
be
litigated
and
subject
to
appellate
review
in
the
normal
course.
so
our
view
is
we
think
not
inconsistent
with
what
mr.
claiborne
said
at
oral
argument.
on
the
further
question
of
the
nature
of
this
lawsuit,
petitioners
concede
that
they
have
brought
this
lawsuit
solely
to
determine
water
rights,
not
because
of
the
nature
of
the
land
for
its
own
sake.
and
in
fact
they
wouldn't
have
article
3
standing
to
bring
this
suit
for
a
determination
of
the
status
of
the
land
because
they
claim
no
interest
in
the
land
itself.
as
to
the
water
rights,
the
effect
would
be
rather
dramatic.
what
they
seek
is
to
divest
the
united
states
of
its
legal
title,
and
the
tribe
of
its
equitable
title,
to
the
reserved
water
right
that
both
claim
was
reserved
by
the
united
states
when
the
land
was
set
aside
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians.
and
finally
it
isn't
true
in
this
case
that
petitioners
seek
nothing
for
themselves
in
the
nature
of
a
property
right.
they
have
brought
this
suit
only
because
the
effect
of
recognition
of
the
reserved
water
right
for
the
united
states
for
these
3,500
acres
on
the
fort
mojave
reservation
would
be
to
subordinate
their
own,
mwd's
own
water
rights
for
the
indian...
i
mean
for,
under
their
contract
with
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
a
water
right,
their
water
right
is
a
property
right.
and
in
fact
the
most
important
element
of
a
water
right,
and
their
water
right
in
particular,
is
its
priority.
and
so
moving
mwd's
water
right
to
a
higher
priority
and
moving
the
united
states'
water
rights
to
the
reservation
to
a
lower
priority
very
definitely
transfers
a
property
right
from
the
united
states
to
mwd
in
this
case.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
in
the
district
court
we
did,
in
the
united
states,
when
the
united
states
withdrew
the
motion
to
dismiss
in
district
court
it
said
that,
if
only
a
boundary
determination,
and
not
title,
is
implicated,
the
quiet
title
act
implied
bar
under
the
apa
is
inapplicable.
that
was...
if
that
were
true
perhaps
that
would
be
a
correct
statement.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
it
simply,
in
this
case
it
simply
isn't
true
that
title
is
implicated,
because
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
a
number
of
things,
a
number
of
things
happened,
a
number
of
things
led
us
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
well,
that
happened
chronologically.
but
what
led
us
to
re-examine
this
were
really
three
separate
and
we
think
important
factors.
first
of
all,
the
united
states
holds
this
land
in
trust
for
the
indian
tribe.
and
in
those
circumstances
it
is
important
that
the
united
states
make
sure
that
everything
is
done
right,
so
that
the
question
of
title
will
be
adjudicated
properly
in
the
proper
forum,
and
in
a
way
that
no
questions
will
be
asked.
secondly,
if
the
question
of
jurisdiction
had
not
been
litigated
there
would
have
been
a
real
question
as
to
whether
any
judgment
in
that
case
would
be
binding
as
a
matter
of
res
judicata,
because
a
judgment
entered
by
a
court
that
does
not
have
subject
matter
jurisdiction
may
be
collaterally
attacked.
that
wasn't
speculative
here,
because
the
very
purpose
of
mwd
bringing
this
lawsuit
was
to
take
the
judgment
in
this
case
and
use
it
in
finally
resolving
the
water
rights
dispute
in
arizona
against
california.
we
wanted
to
make
sure
by
actually
litigating
the
question
of
jurisdiction
that
that
question
would
be
put
to
rest.
far
from
being
dilatory
on
the
question,
we
wanted
to
get
that
question
resolved,
so
we
would
know
where
to
proceed.
and
in
fact
the
purpose
of
taking
an
interlocutory
appeal
was
to
resolve
it--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
our
position
in
the
past
has
been,
and
continues
to
be,
that,
that
the
boundary
dispute,
as
petitioners
claim,
and
as
we
have
said
from
the
beginning,
is
an
essential
element
of
a
water
rights
adjudication.
and
if
the
water
rights
are
to
be
adjudicated
in
this
court
in
all
other
respects,
we
would
submit
that
the
element
of
the
cause
of
action
for
a
water
right,
whether
the
land
is
reserved,
should
also
be
adjudicated
in
arizona
against
california
in
this
court.
and
in
fact
that
was
the
position
of
the
united
states
in
arizona
against
california
i,
and
in
arizona
against
california
ii
we
came
into
this
court
and
sought
recognition
of
the
boundaries.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
was
our
position
in
arizona
against
california
ii.
it
was
not
the
first
time.
the
second
time
it
was
and
the
court
rejected
that.
we're
no
longer,
we're
no
longer
maintaining
that
the
secretary's
determination--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it's
going
to
have
to
be
re-opened
anyway
to
incorporate
the
final
determination.
and
our
view
is
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
in
the
case
in
district
court,
that's
correct.
but
the
boundary
determination
then
would
be
subject
to
whatever
review
this
court
determines
is
appropriate
in
arizona
against
california.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
after
we
see
the
court's
opinion,
we
would
obviously
move
to
do
that
and
consider
that
right
away,
because
we
do
not
have
an
interest
in
delaying
the
court's
resolution
of
this.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
that's
probably
right.
the
united
states,
having
asked
for
a
determination
of
its
water
rights,
and
having
moved
before,
i
think
it
would
be
within
the
power
of
the
other
parties
to
request
a
final
resolution
of
the
water
dispute
that
we
presented
to
the
court
on
the
tribe's
behalf.
now,
it
is
our
view
that
because
the
petitioners
lawsuit
so
intimately
affects
property
rights
in
the
ways
that
we've
described,
that
it
is
really
the
subject
of
special
statutes
that
congress
has
passed
to
govern
the
adjudication
of
property
interests
of
the
united
states--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
i
think
it
is,
because
the
concluding
portion
of
that
first
sentence
in
subsection
a
says,
other
than
an
interest
in
water
rights,
which
certainly
contemplates
that
out
for
the
water
rights
exception,
water
rights
would
be
included
within
the
general
subject
of
interest
in
real
property
in
which
the
united
states
claims
an
interest.
and
the
reason
for
the
exception
for
water
rights
in
the
quiet
title
act,
as
we've
explained
in
our
briefs,
is
the
congress
had
already
provided
a
special
mechanism
for
the
adjudication
of
water
rights
in
which
the
united
states
claims
an
interest,
and
that's
the
so-called
mccarran
amendment.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
and
congress
determined
that
it
would
only
waive
the
immunity
of
the
united
states
to
suit
involving
water
rights
when
there
was
a
general
stream
adjudication,
and
for
very
good
reasons.
because
if
the
united
states
were
subject
to
piecemeal
adjudication
by
every
competing
water
user
on
the
stream,
it
could
be
subject
to
a
whole
series
of
lawsuits,
and
the
judgment
in
the
first
one
wouldn't
bind
the
parties
to
the
second.
and
congress
determined
that
the
united
states
should
be
put
to
the
task
of
defending
its
water
rights
only
when
all
the
users
on
the
stream
would
be
involved.
in
this
case,
this
is
in
no
sense
a
general
stream
adjudication,
as
the
court
held
in
dugan
v.
rank,
was
required.
and
the
legislative
history
of
both
the
quiet
title
act
and
the
administrative
procedure
act
that
we
set
forth
in
pages
28
to
29
of
our
brief
makes
clear
that
congress
understood
what
it
enacted
both
statutes
that
the
mccarran
amendment
was
the
existing
procedure
for
the
adjudication
of
water
rights.
and
because
the
mccarran
amendment
does
not
permit
an
individual
water
user,
such
as
mwd,
to
bring
a
suit
to
quiet
title
on
water
rights,
it
fails
within
the
exception
to
the
apa
for
another
statute
that
grants
consent
to
suit
for
mccarran
amendment
but
impliedly
forbids
the
relief
that
is
sought
in
this
case,
an
adjudication
of
water
rights
as
between
the
united
states
and
only
one
claimant.
so
we
think
that
as
to
the
water
rights
aspect
of
it,
that
the
mccarran
amendment
itself
bars
it,
and
beyond
that
the
quiet
title
act
creates
an
exception
for
water
rights
because
of
this
pre-existing
scheme
for
adjudication
of
water
rights,
and
that
the
express
exception
in
the
quiet
title
act
for
suits
involving
water
rights
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
to
apa
simply
doesn't
permit
a
court
to
adjudicate
this
suit,
because
the
relief
that
it
sought,
a
determination
of
title
to
water
rights,
is
expressly
barred
by
the
quiet
title
act.
so
as
to
the
water
rights
aspect
of
this
case,
which
petitioners
concede
is
the
central
nature
of
this
lawsuit,
the
water
rights,
adjudication
of
water
rights
is
barred
not
once
but
twice
by
independent
suits.
and
precisely
the
sort
of
pre-existing
self-contained
statutory
regimes
that
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
enacted
the
apa
amendments
in
1976
and
included
this
exception
for
other
statutes
that
grant
consent
to
suit.
i
would
finally
like
to
point
out
that
although
petitioner
asserts
in
its
reply
brief
that
we
did
not
raise
the
water
rights
exception
below,
in
pages
16
to
18
of
our
reply
brief,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
we
did
in
fact
raise
the
water
rights,
address
the
water
rights
exception,
precisely
because,
there
as
here,
they
argued
that
this
is
a
suit
about
water
rights.
and
in
response
to
that
we
said,
okay,
if
that's
so
then
it's
expressly
barred
by
the
water
rights
exception
to
the
quiet
title
act.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
in
the
article
3?
yes,
i
think
there's
an
article
3
case
or
controversy
in
the
sense
that
congress
certainly
could
confer
jurisdiction
over
suit
such
as
this.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals'
problem
was
that
to
the
extent
that
this,
that
petitioners
were
characterizing
their
suit
as
a
dispute
about
who
owns
the
land,
they
had
no
interest
in
the
land,
and
therefore
were
not,
were
not
proper
parties
to
such
a
suit.
and
in
fact
this
court's
decisions
in
cragin
v.
powell
and
lane
v.
darlington,
that
we
cite
in
our
brief,
are
situations
where
the
court
held
that
a
party,
a
third
party,
has
no
interest,
no
cognizable
interest,
in
a
boundary
determination
done
for
internal
purposes
by
the
executive
department.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
right.
and
because
that
has
to
be
the
basis
of
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
correct.
and
the
mccarran
amendment
itself
consents
to
suit
only
where
there's
a
general
stream
adjudication.
and
the
justice
department
which
proposed
the
quiet
title
act
and
the
water
rights
exception
to
the
quiet
title
act
specifically
pointed
out,
in
the
1972
quiet
title
act
hearings,
there's
already
an
existing
regime,
that's
the
mccarran
amendment.
we
don't
want
to
disturb
that
existing
regime,
which
required
a
general
stream
adjudication,
and
therefore
the
suit
is
barred.
but
we
do
think
the
express
exception
of
the
quiet
title
act
also
bars
the
suit--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
and
on
that
point
the
legislative
history
of
the
apa
is
also
quite
informative
on
that
question.
because
as
we
point
out
on
page
28
of
our
brief,
the
administrative
conference,
which
proposed
the
amendments
that
were
eventually
enacted
in
1976
to
section
702
pointed
out
that
special
statutory
schemes,
such
as
the
tucker
act
which
permits
certain
remedies
but
not
another,
and
another
one
in
particular
that
was
mentioned
was
special
statutory
regimes
concerning
water
rights,
will
retain
the
same
preclusive
effect
as
they
have
now.
and
this
court
had
already
held,
prior
to
that
time,
in
dugan
v.
rank,
that
only
a
general
stream
adjudication
is
one
within
the
united
states
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
any
other
suit
was
already
precluded
by
dugan
v.
rank
and
the
mccarran
amendment.
so
the
legislative
history
of
the
apa
makes
it
clear
that
the
special
statutory
regime
for
water
rights
in
particular
retained
the
same
preclusive
effect
as
it
had
before.
and
so
we
think
that
both
the
quiet
title
act
and
the
apa
make
clear
that
the
water
rights
exception,
or
water
rights
can't
be
adjudicated.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
mccarran
amendment
itself
would
not
apply
to
the
original
action,
although
the
united
states,
having
intervened,
would
allow
the
adjudication
there,
but
the
last
provision,
the
last
section
of
the
mccarran
amendment
says
that
nothing
in
that
statute
grants
consent
of
the
united
states
to
be
sued
for
adjudication
of
interstate
water
systems.
so
it
wouldn't
apply.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
no.
there
was
a
motion,
there
was
a
withdrawal,
there
was
a
piece
of
paper
in
the
district
court
that
is
quoted--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
we,
we,
we
adverted
to
this
in
our
petition
to
have
the
court
of
appeals
accept
the
interlocutory
appeal,
and
then
we
asserted
it
fully
in
our
brief
on
the
interlocutory
appeal.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
we
did
not,
no.
and
that
question
was
re-examined
in
connection
with
the
entire
appeal.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
and
we
thought
that
had
to
be
resolved.
and
one
last
point
i
wanted
to
make
is
another
ingredient
in
our
re-examination
was
the
mottaz
decision
where,
in
that
case
the
plaintiff
was
not
seeking
to
change
who
held
legal
title.
if
the
plaintiff
had
prevailed
in
mottaz,
united
states
would
have
still
held
legal
title,
albeit
in
trust
for
the
individual
indian.
and
so
that
was
a
case
where
the
title
was,
the
legal
title
would
remain
in
the
united
states,
and
mottaz
therefore
was
an
additional
consideration
in
the
court's
application
of
the
indian
lands
exception,
and
mottaz
was
an
important
consideration.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
certainly
the
quiet
title
act
wouldn't
be
the
preclusion
because
there
wouldn't
be
a
suit
about
adjudication
of
title.
now
whether
there
would
be
some
other
bar
under
the
apa
would
be
a
different
question.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
at
least
the
quiet
title
act
wouldn't.
one
other
point
i
wanted
to
make
about
the
quiet--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--as
i
understood
justice
stevens'
question,
it
did
not
go
to
the
question
of
title.
it
would
be
conceded
that
the
former,
or
the
landowner,
owns
the
land,
it's
just
whether
it's
within
the
political
jurisdiction,
or
political
boundaries
of
the
reservation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
not
necessarily.
there
can
be
non-indian
inholdings
within
the
boundaries
of
an
indian
reservation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
and
incidentally,
there
are
four
non-indian
inholdings
within
the
disputed
3,500-acre
tract
in
this
case.
and
those
landowners
would
have
a
right
to
bring
an
action
under
the
quiet
title
act.
but
petitioner,
petitioner
claims
because
does
not,
because
they're
not
seeking
title,
this
suit
isn't
addressed
by
the
quiet
title
act,
and
therefore
they
should
be
permitted
to
bring
it
under
the
apa.
precisely
the
opposite
conclusion
should
be
drawn
from
the
fact
that
they're
not
claiming
title,
because
if
congress
intended
the
indian
lands
exception
to
prevent
even
a
claimant
to
the
land
in
question
to
bring
a
suit
that
would
disrupt
the
united
states
relationship
with
the
indians,
then
a
fortiori
congress
must
have
intended
to
preclude
a
suit
by
a
stranger
to
the
land
dispute
from
bringing
an
action
that
would
affect,
really
being
an
inter-meddler,
affect
the
interests
of
the
united
states
and
the
indian
tribe.
and
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
congress
expected
that,
and
in
fact
congress
deliberately
confined
the
quiet
title
act
to
suits
brought
by
people
who
are
themselves
claiming
an
interest
in
the
land.
and
that
is
made
clear
by
the
provision
of
the
quiet
title
act
that
requires
the
plaintiff
to
set
forth
with
particularity
the
nature
of
the
interest
he
claims
in
the
land.
because
not
just
as
indian
lands,
but
with
respect
to
lands
generally,
congress
did
not
want
the
united
states
title
to
be
adjudicated
by
people
who
weren't
themselves
claiming
competing
title
in
the
land.
finally,
with
respect
to
the
argument
that
the
united
states
waived
its
immunity
by
intervening
in
arizona
against
california,
petitioners
concede
there's
no
authority
for
that,
and
in
fact
the
rationale
of
the
thekla
rule
upon
which
they
rely
suggests
that
there
shouldn't
be
an
extension
of
that
rationale.
thekla
involved
resolving
all
aspects
of
a
single
case
in
the
same
court
to
resolve
the
same
controversy.
they
are
in
fact
seeking
to
split
off
one
element
of
the
cause
of
action
and
bring
it
in
another
court.
that's
not
only
inconsistent
with
the
rationale
of
thekla,
but
it's
also
inconsistent
with
the
policy
of
congress
in
this
court
to
have
comprehensive
adjudication
of
water
rights.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
not.
it's
technically
not
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
it's
an
affirmative
presentation
of
the
united
states'
claims.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
perhaps
if
the
united
states
sought
to
dismiss
its
claim,
filed
a
complaint
and
then
sought
to
dismiss
it,
then
i
assume
that
would
be
a
withdrawal
of
the
waiver.
but
as
long
as
the
united
states
is
seeking
to
have
the
claim
adjudicated--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--if
the
claim
is
presented
in
arizona
against
california,
yes.
if
this
is
represented
to
the
court
in
arizona
against
california,
we
would
intend
to
go
forward
there.
and
that
has
always
been
our
position.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
if
the
successor
in
office
were
to
dismiss
the
united
states
complaint
in
arizona
v.
california,
then
whether
that
would
waive
the,
or
whether
the
court
could
proceed
to
adjudication
would
be
a
different
question.
but
the
united
states
has
never
sought
to
do
that,
and
continually
has
thought
that
at
least
this
court
was
the
proper
forum
for
adjudication
of
these
disputes.
that
was
our
position
back
in
1961.
