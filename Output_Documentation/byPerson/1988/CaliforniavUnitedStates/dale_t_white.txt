mr.
dale
t.
white
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
tribes
urge
dismissal
of
this
action
based
upon
the
united
states'
sovereign
immunity.
it's
important
to
understand
the
effect
of
this
dismissal.
dismissal
will
not
affect
or
deprive
the
petitioners
of
their
right
to
judicial
review
with
respect
to
their
specific
interest
and
concern
in
this
case.
as
the
petitioners
have
repeatedly
asserted,
their
sole
concern
in
this
case
is
with
their
water
allocation
in
arizona
v.
california.
petitioners
are
protected
in
their
right
to
review
of
that
interest,
because
this
court
in
1983
stated
very
clearly
that
before
the
water
rights
of
the
tribes
are
increased,
based
upon
additional
boundary
acreage,
that
the
petitioners
will
have
their
day
in
court.
so
the
tribes'
position
is
not
that
the
petitioners
are
being
deprived
of
their,
that
dismissal
will
deprive
the
petitioners
of
their
judicial
review
of
the
boundary
orders.
what
we're
saying
is
that
this
particular
action
cannot
go
forward,
and
this
particular
action
cannot
be
the
forum
for
that
review.
mr.
dale
t.
white
well,
there
are
a
couple
of
responses
to
that.
the
first
is
mr.
kneedler
has
stated
that
we
realized
that
there
was
an
indian
lands
exception
quiet
title
act
sovereign
immunity
defense
that
might
have
prevented
the
court
from
having
jurisdiction,
does
prevent
the
court
from
having
jurisdiction.
and
we
did
not
want
to
have
a
judgment
in
the
district
court
that
has
no
good.
and
secondly,
we
realized
that
petitioners'
real
interest
in
this
case
is
their
water
rights,
and
that
we're
having
scope
of
review
and
procedural
problems
in
the
district
court
because
of
that
problem.
they
were
litigating
a
water
rights
issue,
their
water
rights
claim
in
the
district
court,
but
the
lawsuit
was
challenging
the
tribes'
title.
now,
the
proper
forum
for
that
is
where
the
parties
are
claiming
the
water
rights,
and
that's
in
arizona
v.
california.
the
action
is...
the
district
court
is
not
the
forum
for
resolution
of
the
boundary
issues
because
it's
barred
by
the
indian
lands
exception
to
the
quiet
title
act.
as
this
court
is
aware
from
its
previous
decisions
in
block
v.
north
dakota,
and
united
states
v.
mottaz,
the
indian
lands
exception
insulates
trust
or
restricted
indian
lands
from
challenges
by
third
parties.
congress,
in
the
quiet
title
act,
lifted
its
sovereign
immunity
generally
for
claims
against
the
united
states
for
public
federal
lands.
but
congress
in
the
indian
lands
exception
made
a
conscious
decision
to
retain
its
immunity
for
trust
or
restricted
indian
lands.
and
it
made
that
decision
based
upon
the
specific
commitments
and
the
solemn
obligations
of
the
united
states
to
protect
indian
lands
from
challenges.
it
was
based
upon
the
united
states
trust
responsibility
towards
indians
to
protect
their
lands,
and
it
was
based
upon
a
recognition
that
over
the
course
of
history
indians
had
lost
a
great
deal
of
their
traditional
historic
lands.
and
congress
included
that
provision
because
it
did
not
want
indian
lands
to
be
subject
to
any
further
challenges.
the
indian
lands
exception
is
invoked
when
the
united
states
holds
lands
in
trust
and
claims
them
on
behalf
of
indians.
there's
no
requirement,
as
the
petitioners
have
asserted
in
this
case,
that
the
united
states
must
prove
that
its
claim
is
substantial
before
the
exception
is
invoked.
that
requirement
would
be
at
odds
with
and
undermine
the
indian
lands
exception
purpose,
and
the
purpose
behind
sovereign
immunity.
the
purpose
behind
the
doctrine
of
immunity
is
to
prevent
examination
of
the
merits
of
the
government's
claim.
mr.
dale
t.
white
the
government
has
consistently
taken
the
position
that
the,
with
respect
to
the
hay
and
wood
reserve
boundary
of
fort
mojave
reservation,
that
it
is
9,114
acres.
the
united
states
presented
evidence
in
the,
before
special
master
rifkin,
that
it
was
a
9,000-acre
reserve--
mr.
dale
t.
white
--because
special
master
rifkin
decided
that
the
government
survey
that
was
inconsistent
with
its
litigating
position--
mr.
dale
t.
white
--that's
right,
because--
mr.
dale
t.
white
--well,
the
court
decided
in
arizona
v.
california
i
that
it
would
not
decide
it.
parties
had
objected
because
of
the
possibility
of
deciding
title
questions.
in
arizona
v.
california
ii
the
court
did
not
accept
the
united
states'
secretarial
order
standing
along
as
ex
parte
orders.
the
united
states
is
not
saying
that,
and
the
tribes
are
not
saying
that.
mr.
dale
t.
white
for
fort
mojave
reservation
and
for
the
colorado
river--
mr.
dale
t.
white
--only
these
three
reservations
are
involved
in
these
boundary
issues.
i
should
say
that
for
the
fort
yuma
reservation,
the
original
position
of
the
united
states
has
changed
because
the
order,
the
order
of
the,
re-establishing
the
reservation
boundaries
was
issued
in
1978.
but
the
other
reservations
are
the
same.
the
present
action
falls
within
the
protection
of
the
indian
lands
exception.
the
lands
are
held
in
trust
and
claimed
on
behalf
of
the
tribes.
there's
no
dispute
with
that
fact.
the
petitioners
concede
that
the
current
status
of
the
lands
are
trust
lands
and
they're
claimed
by
the
united
states.
the
petitioners'
action
seeks
an
adjudication
of
that
claim,
it
seeks
to
challenge
the
reservation
boundaries.
and
that
takes
the
form
of
two
requests
for
relief.
the
petitioners
seek
to
vacate
the
secretarial
orders.
that
in
itself
will
shift
the
reservation
boundaries
and
reduce
the
total
acreage
of
the
reservations
by
over
30,000
acres
in
total.
and
we
know
what
the
impact
of
that
is
at
the
fort
mojave
reservation.
in
1986,
the
district
court
vacated
the
hay
and
wood
order,
which
severed
3,500
acres
from
the
fort
mojave
reservation.
but
in
addition
to
that,
it's
important
to
understand
that
the
petitioners
also
seek
to
go
further
than
that.
they
seek
in
their
complaint
a
judicial
determination
and
declaration
of
the
reservation
boundaries.
now,
that
determination
will
involve
the
district
court
hearing
all
of
the
evidence
that
is
customary
and
typical
in
a
quiet
title
action.
testimony
of
surveyors,
testimony
of
historians,
consideration
of
title
records,
title
documents,
all
directed
at
the
question
of
whether
the
tribes
are
entitled
to
continue
to
hold
and
own
those
lands.
that
is
clearly
an
adjudication
of
title,
and
that
form
of
relief
is
exactly
the
type
of
relief
that
congress
meant
to
prevent
in
the
indian
lands
exception.
the
petitioners
have
not
advanced
any
valid
arguments
why
the
indian
lands
exception
should
not
apply.
they
say
that
they
don't
seek
title
in
their
own
name,
but
that
argument
and
the
reading
of
that
statute
in
that
way
is
inconsistent
with
the
indian
lands
exception.
congress'
purpose
in
the
exception
was
to
prevent
loss
of
indian
lands.
congress
was
not
concerned
with
who
the
parties
who
were
challenging
the
land
were,
it
was
concerned
with
preventing
loss
of
indian
lands.
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
say
that
a
party
with
a
lesser
interest,
such
as
the
petitioners,
are
entitled
to
challenge
indian
lands.
and
it
also
doesn't
make
any
difference
that
the
lands
would
still
be
held
by
the
united
states
as
blm
public
lands.
the
fact
is
that
the
essential
character
of
the
lands
would
be
completely
altered
if
petitioners
succeed.
the
united
states
would
be
divested
of
its,
of
its
legal
interest
in
the
property,
the
tribes
would
be
stripped
entirely
of
their
equitable
interest
in
the
property.
and
finally,
the
petitioners
cannot
utilize
the
waiver
in
section
702
of
the
apa
to
avoid
the
indian
lands
exception.
mr.
dale
t.
white
those
cases,
i
believe
you're
referring
to
the
disestablishment
cases,
come
up
somewhat
frequently,
and
the
court
has
had
occasion
to
resolve
those.
those
are
usually
brought,
not
against
the
united
states,
but
they're
brought
in
habeas
corpus
action.
and
those
are
the
types
of
issues
that
do
not
concern
title,
they
concern
political
jurisdiction.
and
we're
not
saying
that
those
actions
cannot
be
brought.
they're
not
usually
brought
against
the
united
states.
mr.
dale
t.
white
that's
right.
mr.
dale
t.
white
thank
you.
