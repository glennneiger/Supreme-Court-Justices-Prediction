scalia
you're
not
making
that
argument
here,
are
you?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
mean
the
solicitor
general
can
decide
whether
the
government
will
be
liable
rather
than
the
congress?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
muys,
i
suppose
it's
your
position
that
the
quiet
title
act
would
not
bar
suit
if
you
were
making
the
opposite
contention
here,
that
is
that
the
government,
that
the
government
gave
the
indians
too
little
land
instead
of
too
much
land.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i'm
saying
in
another
case
it
would
be
just,
it
would
be
just
the
opposite.
the
government
would
be
saying,
we
own
this
land
in
our
own
right
and
we're
not
holding
it
as
trustees
for
the
indians.
and
you're
asserting
that
you,
despite
the
quiet
title
act,
or
somebody,
perhaps
the
indians--
justice
antonin
scalia
--would
have
the
right
to
say
no,
you're
only
holding
this
land
in
trust
for
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
say
this
is
just
a
jurisdictional
dispute,
not
a
title
dispute?
if,
couldn't
you
bring
a
quiet
title
act
action
under
state
law
for
a
declaration
that
you
hold
a
piece
of
property
outright
rather
than
you
hold
it
in
trust?
isn't,
i
mean...
whether
you
hold
it
outright
or
in
trust,
isn't
that
a
significant
issue
of
title?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
who
the
plaintiff
is.
the
issue
is
whether
the
united
states
owns
it
outright
or
holds
it
in
trust.
and
that's
not
a
title
issue?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
any
state
cases
about
bringing
suit
to
quiet
title
as
to
whether
you
hold
equitable
or
legal
title?
i'd
be
surprised
if
that
isn't
a
proper
quiet
title
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
the
only
basis
for
standing
is
water
rights,
this
has
to
be
a
water
rights
suit.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
litigate
a
suit
on
the
basis
of
something
that
doesn't
represent
your
standing.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
quiet
title
act
is
just
out
of
it.
the
water
rights
exception
to
the
quiet
title
act
applies,
and
really
the
only
thing
we
should
consider
is
the
mccarran
amendment.
justice
antonin
scalia
--excuse
me.
that
wouldn't
be
a
suit
about
title,
if
it
goes
to
who
has
equitable
title?
only
suits
that
have
legal--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
depends
upon
who
has
equitable
title.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
saying
that
the
titled
indian
lands
can't
even
come
up
collaterally
in
some
other
suit?
what
if
there's
a
criminal
prosecution
for
an
offense
allegedly
committed
on
indian
lands?
could
not
the
defendant
challenge
what
the
boundary
of
the
indian
lands
was?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
maybe
all
we
meant
was
that
there
are
other
ways
to
test
water
rights
without
suing
the
united
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
we're
just
talking
here
about
a
preclusion
of
suit
against
the
united
states.
