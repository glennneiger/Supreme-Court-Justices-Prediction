we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
on
no.
87-1165,
california
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
muys,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
was
tried
in
the
southern
district
of
california?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
object,
mr.
muys,
to
the
government's
change
of
position
between
the
district
court
and
the
ninth
circuit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
is
in
different
courts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
under
justice
stevens'
hypothesis
the
secretary
had
delineated
the
indian
reservation
boundary
40
years
ago,
do
you
think
you
could
come
in
under
the
apa
now
and
say
that
was
wrong?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you're
talking
about
agency
action
with
wrongly
withheld
or--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--it
sounds
as
if,
it
does
have
a
contemporary
flavor
to
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
muys.
mr.
kneedler,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kneedler,
do
you
think
the
position
the
government
is
taking
now
is
consistent
with
the
position
that
the
government
took
in
oral
argument
of
the
arizona
against
california
ii
in
1983?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
a
water
right
is
a
property
right.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
the
government
didn't
petition
to
re-open,
i
suppose
one
of
the
states
could.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
white,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
white.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
muys,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
dugan
was
before
the
enactment
of
quiet
title
act,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
muys.
the
case
is
submitted.
