mr.
jerome
c.
muys
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
the
latest
chapter
in
the
ten-year
effort
of
the
states
of
california
and
arizona
and
several
of
their
public
agencies
to
obtain
a
judicial
determination
of
the
disputed
boundaries
of
the
fort
mojave,
colorado
river,
and
fort
yuma
indian
reservations
on
the
lower
colorado
river
in
order
to
remove
a
cloud
on
the
title
to
104,000
acre-feet
of
water,
which
is
presently
being
used
by
the
metropolitan
water
district
of
southern
california,
to
serve
the
needs
of
over
500,000
citizens
in
its
service
area.
the
water
rights
of
the
three
reservations
were
originally
adjudicated
by
this
court
in
1963
in
arizona
against
california
i.
the
united
states
subsequently
sought
additional
water
for
the
three
reservations,
and
in
1983
in
this
court's
decision
in
arizona
against
california
ii
the
court
rejected
the
united
states'
claims
for
the
additional
104,000
acre-feet
of
water
because
it
was
based
on
claims
stemming
from
the
secretary
of
the
interior's
subsequent
ex
parte
reinterpretation
and
expansion
of
the
boundaries
of
the
three
reservations
without
affording
the
state
parties
notice
or
an
opportunity
to
participate.
and
none
of
those
decisions
ever
received
any
judicial
review.
the
state
parties
had
urged
in
1983
that
this
court
decide
the
boundary
disputes.
but
the
court
directed
us
to
reinstitute,
reactivate
the
then-pending
suit
in
the
southern
district
of
california,
which
the
state
parties
had
brought
to
determine
the
disputed
boundaries.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
yes,
we
had
sought
review
under
section
702--
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
--to
review
the
boundary
decisions
of
the
secretary
under
section
702
of
the
apa.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
the
petitioners,
metropolitan
water
district,
california,
coachella
in
the
state
of
arizona.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
yes.
the
state
parties.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
the
state
says,
as
the
court
directed,
the
states
of
california
and
arizona
were
added
as
parties
to
the
suit
originally
brought
by
metropolitan
and
coachella
water
districts.
after
the
case
was
reactivated,
the
united
states
withdrew
its
defense
of
sovereign
immunity.
taking
up
the
fort
mojave
dispute
first,
the
district
court
voided
the
secretary's
boundary
order,
finding
it
in
excess
of
his
statutory
authority,
and
as
depriving,
having
deprived
metropolitan
of
due
process.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
yes,
in
san
diego.
the
united
states
and
the
tribes
were
granted
interlocutory
appeals
by
the
ninth
circuit
on
those
two
substantive
issues,
but
when
they
reached
the
ninth
circuit
they
resurrected
their
previously-abandoned
sovereign
immunity
in
standing
defenses
before
the
ninth
circuit.
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
the
state
party
suit
was
essentially
a
suit
to
quiet
title,
to
indian
trust
lands,
and
therefore
barred
by
the
quiet
title
act.
it
also
held
that
even
if
our
suit
were
viewed
as
essentially
a
water
rights
suit,
as
we
contend,
that
nevertheless
the
mccarran
amendment
consent
to
suit
provisions
were
inapplicable,
because
we
were
not
seeking
a
complete
adjudication
of
all
the
water
rights
in
the
lower
colorado
river.
and
thirdly,
it
strongly
indicated,
but
didn't
decide,
that
metropolitan
lacked
standing.
let
me
emphasize
what
the
state
parties
are
seeking
in
their
action.
as
we
indicated
to
this
court
in
1983,
and
as
it
noted
in
its
arizona
against
california
ii
opinion,
we
are
not
seeking
to
diminish
or
divest
in
any
way
the
united
states
ownership
interest
of
the
disputed
lands,
nor
are
we
seeking
to
disrupt
the
united
states
commitments
to
the
tribes
in
setting
aside
those
reservations.
all
we
want
is
a
fair
judicial
determination
of
what
the
appropriate
boundaries
of
those
reservations
are
so
that
we
can
delineate
those
federal
public
lands
that
don't
have
a
water
right
from
those
indian
trust
lands
that
may
under
this
court's
decision,
arizona
against
california
i,
have
an
implied
winner's
reserve
water
right.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
yes.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
no.
we
started
with
fort
mojave
first.
we
were
going
to
do
them
in
sequence.
we
did
fort
mojave--
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
--well,
we
won
in
that
the
order
was
set
aside,
but
the
court
did
not
reach
the
merits
of
the
boundary
dispute,
set
aside
the
order,
set
the
matter
for
trial
de
novo,
under
this
court's
exception
in
overton
park,
because
it
found
the
secretary's
boundary
determination
essentially
adjudicatory
in
nature
and
woefully
inadequate
as
far
as
the
fact-finding
involved.
so
we
were
set
to
go
to
trial,
but
interlocutory
appeal
intervened.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
that's
what
we
had
asked
for,
and
that's
what
the
district
court
granted.
that
issue
was
never
reached
by
the
ninth
circuit.
they
threw
us
out
on
the
resurrected
sovereign
immunity
defense
by
united
states.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
well,
in
their
briefs
before
the
ninth
circuit,
it
seems
to
me
it
was
in
the
fall
of,
or
early,
fall
of
1986
or
early
1987.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
they
had
earlier
amended
their
motion
to
dismiss
our
district
court
action,
as
you
recall,
after
the
court
admonished
the
deputy
solicitor
general
noroargen
about
those
defenses
that
had
been
raised,
and
made
some
comments
that
they
had
been
raised
in
the
decision,
arizona
against
california
ii.
the
government
amended
its
motion
to
dismiss
before
the
district
court
and
said,
we
think
that
where
the
suit
seeks
only
the
determination
of
the
boundaries
and
doesn't
attempt
to
affect
title,
the
action
may
go
forward
under
the
apa.
after
we
won,
they
had
a
change
of
heart.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
the
government
would
still
own
it.
it
would
own
it
now
in
unrestricted
fee
title.
it
now
claims
that
it
holds
it
in
trust
for
the
tribes.
but
the
underlying
federal
ownership
would
not
change,
but
the
relationship
to
the
tribes
would
change,
at
least
temporarily.
if
we
prevail
on
the
merits,
and
our
view
of
the
boundaries
prevails,
why
those
lands
would
immediately
be
back
in
public
land
status.
but
there's
nothing
to
prevent
the
united
states
from
rededicating
them
in
trust
to
the
tribes
for
beneficial
use
on
the
land.
the
big
difference
would
be
those
lands
would
no
longer
have
an
implied
water
right
dating
back
to
the
19th
century
executive
orders
that
the
secretary
chose
to
reinterpret.
but
they
would
have
an
implied
water
right,
if
any,
dating
from
the
later
more
current
legislative
or
administrative
action,
rededicating
them
in
trust
purposes
for
the
tribes.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
no,
we
didn't,
your
honor.
we
were
convinced
by
the
cases
that
jurisdiction
is
a
matter
that
can
be
raised
at
any
time.
we
think
there
ought
to
be
some
kind
of
estopped
at
some
point
when
the
government
leads
us
through
these
many
hoops
and
changes
position.
we
go
through
a
year
or
two
of
trial
before
the
district
court
and
then
after
they
lose
they
decide,
well,
maybe
it
wasn't
such
a
good
idea
to
concede
that
the
apa
applied
rather
than
the
quiet
title
act.
but
we
didn't
think
we
could
prevail
on
that
point.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
we're
not
trying
to
estop
them
by
pleadings
or
say
they--
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
--i
think
it
would
be
a
good
rule
personally,
but
i
think--
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
--that's
right.
our
basic,
our
basic
position
on
the
sovereign
immunity
issue
is
twofold.
first,
we
say
that
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
that
attended
the
united
states
intervention
in
arizona
against
california
i
and
the
assertion
of
claims
for
these
three
reservations
ought
to
be
available
to
us
in
our
present
pending
suit
in
the
district
court,
particularly
since...
the
united
states
came
in,
they
loaded
this
winner's
claim
on
us,
put
a
cloud
in
our
title
30
years
ago,
and
then
it
wasn't
resolved
by
the
court
in
arizona
against
california
i.
it's
still
here.
we
need
certainty,
we
need
the
resolution,
we
think
the
tribes
need
a
resolution.
we
think
that
once
the
government
put
that
claim
at
issue,
it
wasn't
resolved,
that
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
ought
to
follow
that
claim
wherever
it's
prevailed,
wherever
we
pursue
it.
we
just
happen
to
be
in
a
different
federal
court
now.
we're
not
in
this
court,
we're
down
in
the
southern
district
of
california.
but
we
rely
on
the
principle
that
justice
holmes
announced
in
the
thekia
case
in
1926.
it
says,
when
the
united
states
comes
into
court
to
assert
a
claim,
it
so
far
takes
the
position
of
a
private
suiter
as
to
agree
by
implication
that
justice
may
be
done
with
regard
to
the
subject
matter,
the
subject
matter,
not
just
in
this
court
or
not
just
when
the
united
states
wants
to
pick
a
particular
forum,
but
with
respect
to
that
subject
matter
that's
the
basis
of
their
claim
in
which
the
united
states
lays
before
the
courts
for
judicial
resolution.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
we
would
have
petitioned
this
court
in
arizona
against
california
to
reopen
the
decree
and
decide
the
boundary
disputes
as
we
had
asked
it
to
do
in
1983.
in
the
1983
decision
the
court
said,
there
will
be
time
enough,
if
any
of
these
defenses
that
the
united
states
has
pending
down
in
the
district
court
are
sustained
and
not
reversed
on
judicial
review,
to
come
back
to
the
court
and
let
the
court
decide
whether
it's
prepared
to
decide
the
boundary
disputes
in
the
original
proceeding,
arizona
against
california.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
second
time.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
we're
trying,
your
honor.
but
we're
not
doing
too
well.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
well,
the
court
in
arizona
against
california
ii
said
the
united
states
won't
get
any
additional
water
for
the
three
reservations
until
they
come
in
and
demonstrate
that
the
boundaries
have
been
finally
determined,
and
either
judicially
reviewed
by
another
court
or
lay
before
this
court
for
review.
so
the
ultimate
impact
of
a
water
rights
reallocation
that
gives
us
104,000
acre-feet
to
the
tribes,
for
sure,
won't
occur
until
some
action
by
this
court
in
arizona
against
california.
now,
why
the
tribes
in
the
united
states
have
been
dilatory
in
trying
to
delay
and
avoid
determination
on
the
merits
is
something
we
don't
understand.
we
think
it's
in
everyone's
interest
to
get
these
matters
decided.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
you're
right.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
yes,
we
have.
a
lot
more
people
have
flooded
into
southern
california
that
are
needing
water.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
well,
it's
true--
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
--we
can
sit
there
and
the
water
can
keep
coming
down
the
river
and
we
can
use
it.
but
it's
not
a
sensible
way
to
plan
for
the
needs
of
14
million
people
in
southern
california.
and
that
block
of
water
is
an
important
block
of
water.
we
have
to
know
whether
we're
going
to
have
title
to
it
or
we're
not
going
to
have
title
to
it.
it
we're
going
to
lose
it
we've
got
to
get
out
and
hustle
and
find
some
replacement
water
in
northern
california
or
somewhere.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
in--
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
--not
metropolitan.
there
may
be
some
very
limited
agricultural
use
in
the
metropolitan
water
district.
but
we're
not
representing
the
imperial
irrigation
district.
coachella
valley
water
district
serves
the
palm
spring
areas,
but
they're
only
indirectly
and
contingently
affected
by
this
dispute.
metropolitan,
which
serves
all
the
urban
area
in
southern
california,
is
a
party
out
of
whose
hide
this
water
will
come.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
yes,
domestic,
industrial,
all
the
things
that
go
into
a
viable
urban
area.
now,
we
can
see
no
policy
reasons
why
the
thekia
rule
should
not
be
extended
to
our
case,
particularly
where
you
have
same
parties
against
whom
the
claim
was
asserted
originally
in
arizona
against
california,
now
the
plaintiffs.
it's
the
same
issue,
what
is
the
boundary?
we're
not
seeking
any
affirmative
relief,
we're
not
trying
to
go
beyond
what
the
united
states
asked
for.
so
it's
just
like
a
compulsory
counter-claim.
we're
just
trying
to
resolve
the
issue
that
the
court,
that
the
united
states
lay
before
the
court.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
it
is
a
different
court.
but
suppose
the
government
brings
a
claim
in
the
district
court
and
it
gets
transferred
under
1404(a)
for,
to
a
more
convenient
forum,
i
mean,
does
that,
does
it
somehow
change
the
ballgame?
we
think
when
they
submit
a
matter
before
the
federal
courts,
for
adjudication,
the
fact
that
it
ultimately
may
be
shifted
to
a
different
forum
shouldn't
affect
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
that
tends
putting
that
issue
before
the
courts.
there
are
no
cases
to
support
it.
none
have
ever
gone
that
far.
but
we
think
the
principle
is
there,
and
the
equity
is
there,
one
no
harm
to
the
public
interest,
in
extending
the
thekia
principle
in
the
limited
circumstances
of
this
case
to
our
suit.
now,
we
think
it's,
there's
no...
the
united
states
says,
well,
there's
no
statutory
authority
for
that.
well,
but
the
united
states
has,
the
attorney
general
has
statutory
authority
to
bring
lawsuits.
in
this,
the
thekia
rule
is
a
judicially-created
rule
that
states
the
consequences
of
bringing
or
intervening
in
a
lawsuit.
so
we
think
it's
analogous
to
principles
of
ancillary
and
pendant
jurisdiction,
or
considerations
of
wise
judicial
administration
that
this
court
relied
on--
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
--no,
no.
our
best
shot
is
on
the
quiet
title
act.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
we
win
on
either,
we
win
on
either
one,
i
think.
on
the
administrative
procedure
act
point,
section
702
provides
for
judicial
review
of
federal
agency
action
unless
another
statute
that
grants
consent
to
suit
expressly
or
impliedly
forbids
relief
which
is
sought.
now,
we
think
the
ninth
circuit's
conclusion
at
the
quiet
title
act
is
such
a
suit
is
clearly
wrong.
the
basic
purpose
of
the
quiet
title
act,
it's
legislative
history,
it's
language,
all
the
decisions
that
have
construed
it
over
the
last
16
years
make
it
clear
that
it
only
applies
to
a
suit
by
a
party
claiming
a
property
interest
in
disputed
lands
in
which
the
united
states
also
claims
a
property
interest,
and
secondly,
that
the
plaintiff
is
seeking
to
diminish
or
divest
the
united
states
of
that
ownership
interest.
that's
not
the
purpose
of
our
suit,
it
can't
be
its
effect.
since
the
quiet
title
act
is
limited
to
such
particular
ownership
disputes,
it
cannot
impliedly
forbid
our
action
which
does
not
seek
such
relief.
now,
the
genesis
of
the
quiet
title
act
was
a
recommendation
of
the
public
land
law
review
commission
in
1970
to
the
congress
that
it
waive
sovereign
immunity
with
respect
to
suits
to
quiet
title
in
which
there
were
claims
by
a
private
party
against
the
united
states
for
ownership
interest.
now,
the
subsequent
legislative
development
of
the
quiet
title
act
focused
on
ownership
disputes,
and
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
in
all
the
cases
since
then,
of
the
dozens
of
cases
that
have
interpreted
the
quiet
title
act
none
has
ever
applied
the
quiet
title
act
where
the
plaintiff
was
not
seeking
to
diminish
or
divest
the
united
states
of
its
claimed
ownership
interest.
secondly,
only
one
case
has
ever
applied
the
quiet
title
act
where
the
plaintiff
was
not
also
claiming
a
property
interest
in
its
own
right
in
those
disputed
lands.
now,
in
contrast
to
the
ownership
focus
of
the
quiet
title
act,
the
public
land
law
review
commission
also
recommended
to
congress
that
it
provide
for
judicial
review
of
adjudications,
public
land
adjudications.
and
it
noted
at
the
same
time
that
there
was
then
pending
before
the
congress
the
recommendation
of
the
administrative
conference
of
the
united
states
that
congress
enact
a
broad
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
that
was
eventually
enacted
as
section
702
of
the
apa
in
1976.
that
makes
it
clear,
if
you
carefully
analyze
these
two
statutes,
that
the
quiet
title
act
applies
only
where
a
private
party
is
asserting
a
property
interest
against
the
united
states
and
seeking
to
divest
the
united
states
of
its
claimed
ownership
interest,
but
does
not
get
involved
with
any
other
statutes,
whereas
the
administrative
procedure
act
applies
in
situations
where
there
is
no
challenge
to
underlying
ownership
of
the
united
states
but
simply
a
challenge
as
to
the
way
the
united
states
has
administered
federal
laws
that
apply
to
those
public
lands.
two
distinct
areas.
careful
analysis
will
show
they
deal
with
completely
different
things.
now,
the
united
states
tries
to
blur
the
distinctions
between
the
two
acts
in
its
brief.
but
it's
clear
that
they,
government
has
recognized
the
distinction
between
the
appropriate
spheres
of
operation
of
the
quiet
title
act
and
the
administrative
procedure
act
in
three
critical
instances,
as
we
point
out
in
our
briefs,
during
the
legislative
history
of
both
the
quiet
title
act
and
section
702.
and
more
recently
in
its
briefs
before
this
court,
in
block
against
north
dakota,
on
which
they
place
such
heavy
reliance,
we
quote
the
portion
of
the
brief
which
says,
the
apa
doesn't
relate
to
underlying
boundary
disputes,
but
of
course
it
relates
to
review
of
agency
action
that
violates
statutory
or
constitutional
law.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
well,
we
think
not,
because
we're
not
trying...
that
would,
again
we
wouldn't
be
trying
to
divest
the
united
states
of
any
of
its
interest.
indeed,
the
result
of
our
suit,
if
we
prevail
in
the
boundary,
would
be
to
enhance
the
united
states
title.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
in
this
case.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
that's
right.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
that's
right.
we
think
the
apa
applies
when
you're
dealing
with
review
of
management-type
decisions.
the
government
concededly
owns
the
federal
lands,
but
they're
doing
something
with
it
as
far
as
adjusting
interests
that
someone
disagrees
with.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
it
was
all
public
land,
yes.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
so
the
only
result--
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
--no
private
claims
of
any
sort.
the
only
result
of
the
boundary
resolution
will
be
to
change
the
boundary--
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
--public
on
one
side,
indian
on
the
other.
that's
all.
with
all
due
respect,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
government's
current
expansive
reinterpretation
of
the
scope
of
the
quiet
title
act
changing
the
story
they've
told
the
court
in
the
past
and
they
told
the
district
court
simply
reflects
the
desperate
lengths
the
government
is
willing
to
go
to
avoid
a
resolution
of
these
boundary
disputes.
and
why
they
continue
to
do
that--
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
--well,
we
think,
in
a
situation
like
that,
justice
stevens,
the
issue
that's
sought
to
be
resolved
is
a
jurisdictional
issue,
not
a
title
issue.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
we
assume
that
the
private
owner
owns
a
large
ranch
and
he
just
wants
to
know
where
the
indian
reservation
boundary
is
so
he
knows
whether
federal
law,
whether
he's
going
to
be
subject
to
tribal
law,
let's
say--
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
--in
part
of
his
ranch,
or
state
law
in
the
rest
of
it,
that's
a
jurisdictional
dispute,
that's
not
a
title
question.
and
i
think
that's
where
the
ninth
circuit
went
astray.
one
of
the
cases
that
the
government
relies
on
is
fadem
against
the
united
states,
another
ninth
circuit
decision.
in
that
case,
in
a
not-carefully
considered
dictum,
the
ninth
circuit
said,
all
boundary
disputes
with
the
government
are
governed
by
the
quiet
title
act.
well,
that's
just
not
so.
there
are
a
lot
of
jurisdictional--
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
--we
think
they
get
review
under
702,
yes.
they'd
be
reviewing
the
action
of
the
secretary
in
making
a
boundary
determination
that
established
different
spheres
of
jurisdiction
on
that--
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
--well,
we
think
so,
yes.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
well,
they
claim
we
can't
get
in
under
the
apa
because
the
quiet
title
act
is
another
statute
that--
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
--they
haven't...
it's
implied
from
their
briefs,
they
say,
they
say
treating
our
suit
as
a
water
rights
suit
that
the
quiet
title
act
aside
that
maybe
we
couldn't
get
in
because
they
think
the
mccarran
amendment--
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
--yes.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
yes.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
yes.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
well,
i
don't
know.
i
haven't
found
cases
applying
a
statute
of
limitations
to
apa
review.
most,
many
public
land
decisions--
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
--right,
right.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
it
does,
it
does.
but
there's
no
statute
of
limitations.
most
public
land
decisions,
by
the
secretary,
are
only
subject
to
a
laches
defense.
if
you
wait
too
long--
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
--yes,
we,
we
tried
to
get
in
here
and
we've
tried,
we've
tried
several
different
forums.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
well,
not
to
the
underlying
title.
i
think
if
the
plaintiff
were
claiming
some
kind
of
interest,
that
it
held,
it
was
entitled
to
hold
the
land
in
some
status,
i
think
it
would
be
a
quiet
title
act
action.
but
when
the
plaintiff
is
not
seeking
title,
not
seeking
the
quiet
title
in
itself--
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
--well,
i
don't
think,
it's
no
more
a
title
issue
than
whether,
when
the
united
states
grants
a
lease
or
right-of-way,
or
some
other
kind
of
federal
privilege,
it
adjusts
its
ownership
interest.
but
the
underlying
ownership
interest
of
the
united
states
holding
this
land
in
fee
title
is
not
affected
by
our
claim.
we
think
that's
the
only
kind
of
case
the
quiet
title
act
applies
to.
now,
it's
easy
to
say,
well,
there's
some
dispute
about
what
the
respective
interests
are
in
the
surface,
and
that's
a
quiet
title
issue.
but
i
think
that's
a
very
loose
kind
of
characterization
of
quiet
title.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
well,
to
bring
a
suit
as
to
whether
the
plaintiff
holds
equitable
or
legal
title,
but
i
think,
you
know,
if
a...
a
quiet
title
action
has
to
have
all
the
effective
parties
in
there.
and
i
don't
think
a
third
party
could
come
in
off
the
street
and
raise
that
issue
without
having
some
serious
standing
problems,
which
we
have
avoided
because
it's
basically
a
water
rights
issue.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
dealing
with
the
mccarran
act
issue
for
a
moment,
the
united
states
wants
the
court
to
give
the
same
effect
to
the
mccarran
amendment
that
it
gave
to
the
quiet
title
act
as
being
the
exclusive
means
of
having
any
kind
of
adjudication
on
water
rights.
in
other
words,
it
wants
the
court
to
say,
the
mccarran
amendment
has
preempted
the
field,
there's
no
other
way
you
can
test
a
federal
agency
action
that
may
just
affect
water
rights
short
of
a
whole
general
stream
adjudication.
we
think
that
that
argument
has
to
overcome
at
least
three
decisions
of
this
court.
in
dugan
against
rank,
where
private
water
rights
owners
challenged
the
operation
of
the
central
valley
project,
the
court
said
the
mccarran
amendment
wasn't
applicable,
but
they
applied
the
officer
suit
test
to
see
whether
the
suit
against
the
officials
was
appropriate,
unlike
block
against
north
dakota
where
the
court
said
that
there's
no
room
for
an
officer
suit
in
light
of
the
quiet
title
act.
so
at
least
in
dugan
against
rank,
the
court
seemed
to
feel
that
the
mccarran
amendment
had
not
completely
preempted
the
field.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
yes.
and
before
the
apa
waiver.
but
at
least
they
recognized
that
there
was
another
means
of
getting
at
federal
officials
interfering
with
water
rights.
and
then
in
the
colorado
river
conservation
district
number
one
against
united
states
in
1976
and
arizona
against
san
carlos
apache
tribes
in
1983,
the
court
said
that
the
mccarran
amendment
was
not
the
exclusive
vehicle
for
testing
water
rights.
those
cases
turned
on
jurisdictional
issues,
whether
the
united
states
and
indian
tribes
could
bring
water
right
actions
in
the
federal
district
court,
even
though
there
might
be
a
general
stream
adjudication
under
the
mccarran
act,
either
going
on
or
threatened.
and
so
it
seemed
to
us
that
there's
certainly
an
implication
in
those
cases,
again,
that
the
mccarran
act
had
not
preempted
the
field
of
all
water
rights
actions.
it
preempts
the
field
on
general
stream
adjudications,
but
there's
still
leeway.
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
well--
mr.
jerome
c.
muys
--well,
the
indian
claims,
though,
in
arizona
against
san
carlos
apache,
were
claims
brought
in
the
federal
district
court
against
the
united
states
and
all
other
water
users,
because
many
times
the
united
states
has
water
rights
on
behalf
of
other
federal
agencies
that
are
inconsistent
with
indian
claims.
so
i'm
quite
sure,
in
san
carlos
apache,
the
suit
involved
claims
by
the
tribes
against
the
united
states.
no
problems
were
suggested
about
a
lack
of
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
so
we
think
that
the
mccarran
act
does
not
fit
the
mold
of
the
quiet
title
act,
as
interpreted
in
block
against
north
dakota.
we
suggested
the
ninth
circuit
could
squeeze
our
case
under
the
mccarran
amendment
because
it
was
as
comprehensive
an
action
as
is
possible.
this
court
had
already
done
a
general
stream
adjudication
on
the
lower
colorado
river
in
arizona
against
california
i,
was
still
retaining
complete
jurisdiction
over
all
the
water
rights
on
the
river.
all
that
were
left
were
the
three
unadjudicated
boundary
disputes
on
the
three
reservations.
so,
as
this
court
said
in
the
eagle
county
case,
the
mccarran
amendment
should
not
be
interpreted
inflexibly
and
narrowly.
we
sought
as
comprehensive
adjudication
as
possible.
thank
you
for
your
attention.
