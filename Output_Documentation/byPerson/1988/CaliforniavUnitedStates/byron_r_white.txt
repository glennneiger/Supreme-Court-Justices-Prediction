justice
byron
r.
white
which
was
the
second
time
we
refused
to--
justice
byron
r.
white
--we
refused
to
decide
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
client
didn't
want
to
get
it
decided
here
either
in
1983.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it's
kind
of
changed
its
mind
now
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
clients
shouldn't
be
in
much
of
a
hurry
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
got
the
water.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
water
isn't
all
domestic
use,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
are
your
clients,
your
water
districts,
aren't
they
serving
the
agricultural
community?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it's
for
domestic
use,
or
also
for
commercial
use
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
your
best
shot
on
the
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
each
of
these,
in
this
case,
or
in
any
of
these
reservations,
is
any
of
the
land
that
the
secretary
included
in
the
indian
reservations,
was
that,
was
that
all
federal
land?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
private
interests.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
kind
of
public
land--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
it
weren't
for
the
quiet
title
act
there
would
be
no
question
that
you
could
get
in
the
court
on
the
apa.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
isn't,
the
apa...
the
united
states
doesn't
claim
any,
otherwise,
isn't
it
just
the
quiet
title
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand,
i
understand.
but
if
it
weren't
for
that
acts
there
would
be
apa
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
think
it's
still
a
jurisdictional
argument
if
they,
at
one
point
they
said
the
quiet
title
act
didn't
interfere
with
apa
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
they
interpret
the
quiet
title
act
differently.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
is
a
jurisdictional
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you're
talking
to
the
court
as
soon
as
you
could,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
but
your
claim,
your
claim
has
been
that
the
secretary's
ruling
should
be
accepted
as
a
final
determination.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you,
so
you...
if
you
prevail
in
this
case,
and
the
case
cannot
be
adjudicated,
you
think
arizona
against
california
has
to
be
re-opened.
it's
going
to
have
to
be
re-opened
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
won't
be...
if
you
win
there
won't
be
a
final
determination,
any
kind
of
a
determination
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
the
united
states
would
then
petition
this
court
to
re-open.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
that's
for
a
whole
river
system.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
quiet
title
act
aside,
the
question
is
a
relationship
between
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
the
mccarran
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
that
mccarran
act
is
the
statute
that
takes
the
case
out
of
the
apa.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
kneedler,
do
we
have
in
the
record
a
piece
of
paper
where
you
withdrew
your
sovereign
immunity?
is
there
a
piece...
was
that
just
oral
or--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
then
a
piece
of
paper
reasserting
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
never
did
assert
that
in
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
curious
why,
is
it
because
you
lost
in
the
district
court
that
you
want
another
shot
at
it?
or
what?
you...
i
don't
know
why
you
would,
at
the
outset
necessarily,
prefer
having
the
issue
resolved
here
than
in
the
district
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
government's
position
as
to
the
exact
location
of
the
boundaries
different
now
than
it
was
back
in
the
1960s?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
well,
the
government
lost
that,
before
the
special
master.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
decided
then
that...
we
didn't
think
it
was
necessary
to
decide
the
issue
at
that
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
we
did
it
again
in
1983.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
as
far
as
the
actual
amount
of
land
involved,
the
government's
position
is
the
same,
and
the
tribes'
position
is
the
same
as
it
was
in
the
1960s?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
have
been
some
new
things
come
up
from
other
reservations,
haven't
there?
