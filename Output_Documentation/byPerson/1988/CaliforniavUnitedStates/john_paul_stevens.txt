justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
muys,
may
i
ask
another
question
about
this
boundary
dispute
approach
to
the
case?
supposing
a
landowner
owned
a
very
large
ranch
or
tract
of
land,
part
of
which
was
in
an
indian
reservation
and
part
was
not,
but
he
might
be
subject
to
certain
indian
laws,
part
in
the
indian
reservation
and
not
outside
the
reservation.
would
that
party
have
the
right
to
bring
an
action
under
the
quiet
title
act
against
the
united
states
to
determine
the
boundary?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
would
say
in
that...
i
want
to
understand
what
you
were
explaining.
in
that
case
you
would
say,
say
the
department
of
interior
just
moved
the
boundary
or
something,
that
the
private
party
could
get
review
under
702?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
at
that
point,
mr.
kneedler,
you
say
that
the
water
right
is
a
property
right,
which
certainly
seems
sensible.
you
contend
it's
an
interest
in
real
property
within
the
meaning
of
the
quiet
title
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
may
i
ask
you
in
that
connection,
because
you
explained
the
reasons
for
the
change
of
position,
had
you
not
changed
your
position,
had
let
the
case
go
to
judgment,
your
position
today
would
be
that
you
could
collaterally
attack
that
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
also
ask
you
the
question
i
asked
your
opponent
about
a
private
owner
who
owned
land
that
was
partially
within
a
reservation
and
partially
outside,
wanted
review
of
a
recent
administrative
decision
changing
the
boundary
to
a
reservation
because
of
interest
in
what
law
would
apply
to
portions
of
his
property.
would
you
say
that
was
subject
to
review
under
702?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
would
that
waiver
be
subject
to
revocation
by
the
government,
the
waiver
in
the
original
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
couldn't
the
united
states
change
its
position
in
that
case
also?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
we
have
any
guarantee
the
united
states
won't
change
its
position
again,
is
what
i'm
really
asking?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would,
but
what
if
your
successor
in
office,
by
the
time
it
gets
us,
has
a
different
view?
