mr.
charles
a.
palmer
thank
you,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
first
discuss
the
mental
retardation
issue.
in
so
doing,
i
in
no
way
denigrate
the
importance
of
the
other
issue.
we
think
it's
very
important,
but
i
think
the
argument
will
flow
more
smoothly
this
way.
implicit
in
penry's
eighth
amendment
argument
is
the
suggestion
that
this
court
should
abandon
to
mental
health
professionals
the
task
of
determining
the
mental
status
of
defendants
in
criminal
cases.
the
difficulty
with
this
is
that
even
though
there
might
be
some
areas
of
the
law
in,
in
which
it
would
be
desirable
for
the
social
sciences
to
inform
the
court's
decision
making
process,
penry's
case
provides
a
perfect
example
of
why
they
should
not
do
so
in
this
context.
i
think
it's
a
popular
misconception
that
there
are
all...
all
mentally
retarded
people
are
the
same,
that
is
to
say,
they
are
so
mentally
deficient
that
they're
unable
to
care
for
themselves
or
unable
to
function
in
society.
in
fact,
as
justice
blackmun
adverted
to
somewhat
earlier,
there
are
varying
degrees
of
mental
retardation.
and
penry
is
in
the
category
which
is
most
nearly
normal.
further,
regardless
of
whether
or
not
penry
might
properly
be
diagnosed
as
mentally
retarded,
it
is
clear
that
he
is
capable
of
deliberate
actions,
and
it
is
clear
that
he
is
fully
aware
of
the
consequences
of
those
actions.
it
is
also
clear
that
in
the
criminal
proceedings
which
led
to
his
conviction
and
sentence
of
death,
that
his
mental
status
was
taken
into
account
on
at
least
three
occasions.
prior
to
trial
he
filed
a
motion
asserting
he
was
incompetent
to
stand
trial.
in
accordance
with
texas
law,
a
jury
was
impaneled
to
determine
the
competency
issue.
both
penry
and
the
state
presented
psychiatric
evidence,
and
penry
himself
testified
in
his
behalf.
he
testified,
among
other
things,
that
he
had
worked
as
a
busboy,
that
he
had
been
paid
$2.50
an
hour,
that
he
had
previously
been
incarcerated
in
the
texas
prison.
he
was
able
to
name
the
unit
of
the
prison
and
the
town
in
which
it
was
located.
he
was
able
to
tell
the
date
on
which
he
was
paroled.
he
described
delivering
appliances
to
the
home
of
his
murder
victim,
described
being
paid
$18,
being
paid
by
check,
the
floor
plan
of
the
house,
the
tasks
that
were
necessary
to
install
the
appliances.
and
finally,
he
testified
that
he
consented
to
a
search
of
his
home
because
he
believed
that
thereby
he
would
obtain
more
lenient
treatment.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
competency
hearing,
the
jury
found
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
he
was
competent
to
stand
trial.
the
jury
was
then
dismissed
and
the
second
jury
was
impaneled
to
hear
the
trial
on
the
merits.
penry
pled
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
under
the
texas
insanity
statute,
which
provides
an
insanity
defense
may
be
based
on
either
mental
disease
or
a
mental
defect
such
as
penry's.
again,
the
jury
heard
conflicting
psychiatric
testimony
from
the
state
and
from
penry.
penry
did
not
testify,
but
he
was
present
in
the
courtroom
during
the
week-long
trial,
and
the
jury
was
able
to
deserve
his
demeanor
and
actions.
in
addition,
the
state
introduced
penry's
two
written
confessions,
which
severely
undermined
his
insanity
defense
as
well
as
his
eighth
amendment
claim
before
this
court.
penry
not
only
confessed
to
the
rape/murder
for
which
he
is
presently
on
death
row,
but
also
to
two
prior
rapes.
and
i'd
like
to
recite
very
briefly
what
the
evidence
showed
with
regard
to
those
offenses
because
i
think
it
belies
any
assertion
mr.
penry
is
not
competent,
sane
and
fully
accountable
for
his
actions
under
every
test
currently
operative
under
the
law.
the
first
rape
took
place
when
penry
approached
his
victim's
trailer
home
at
night
and
flipped
off
her
electric
power
switch
to
entice
her
outside
the
house.
he
was
wearing
a
stocking
over
his
face
so
that
he
would
not
be
identified
and
was
wielding
a
screwdriver,
which
he
used
to
force
her
to
submit
to
an
act
of
rape
and
to
perform
an
act
of
oral
sodomy
on
him.
several
weeks
later,
when
he
learned
that
she
had
reported
this
incident
to
the
police
he
returned,
again
with
a
stocking
over
his
face,
and
this
time
wielding
a
switchblade
knife,
severely
beat
his
victim
and
pushed
her
off
the
roof
of
her
trailer
house.
the
second
rape
took
place
when
he
encountered
a
woman
whom
he
knew
personally
and
fabricated
a
story
about
his
brother
having
been
in
a
car
wreck
to
persuade
this
woman
to
give
him
a
ride.
she
did
so,
and
he
raped
her
twice
at
knife-point.
he
was
convicted
of
this
rape
and
sentenced
to
five
years
in
the
penitentiary.
he
had
been
on
parole
from
that
conviction
for
some
seven
months
when
he
committed
the
rape/murder
that
the
case
today
is
concerned
with.
again,
the
evidence
showed
that
penry
went
to
his
victim's
house
with
an
open
switchable
knife
in
his
pocket
and
with
the
conscious
intent
to
kill
her
after
he
had
raped
her
so
that
she
would
not
testify
against
him.
the
evidence
further
showed
that
she
resisted
vigorously,
attempted
to
stab
him
with
a
pair
of
scissors,
but
that
he
overcame
her
resistance
and
forced
her
to
submit
by
throwing
her
to
the
floor
and
kicking
her
with
his
cowboy
boots.
the
evidence
showed
the
rape
took
half
an
hour
to
consummate,
and
after
it
was
over,
penry
retrieved
the
scissors
the
victim
had
used,
walked
back
over
to
her,
sat
down
on
her,
told
her
he
was
going
to
kill
her
and
plunged
the
scissors
into
her
chest.
the
jury
rejected
the
insanity
defense
and
found
him
guilty
of
capital
murder.
at
the
punishment
phase,
the
jury
was
asked
to
answer
three
special
issues,
the
first
of
which
inquired
whether
penry's
conduct
was
deliberate.
again,
the
jury
was
instructed
to
consider
penry's
evidence
of
mental
retardation.
the
jury
answered
all
the
special
issues
affirmatively.
in
arguing
for
a--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--no,
your
honor.
i
am
trying
to
make
the
point
that
regardless
whether
he
fits
within
a
clinical
definition
of
mental
retardation,
that
his
mental
status
is
such
that
he
knew
what
he
was
doing.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
yes,
your
honor.
i,
i--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--in
arguing
for
a
bright
line
rule--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
it
requires
any
argument
on
my
part
for
the
court
to
understand
that
children
of
that
age
do
not
commit
these
sorts
of
acts.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
your
honor--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--your
honor,
i
possess
no
expertise
in
this
area.
these
mental
ages
that
have
been
referred
to
came
from
penry's
expert
witnesses
at
the
trial,
and
it
was
not
explored
through
cross-examination
or
otherwise
what
this
meant.
what
they
testified
was
he
intellectually
functions
at
an
age
between
six
and
seven
and
functions
in
a
social
environment
at
age
between
nine
and
ten.
beyond
that,
i
can
assist
the
court
no
further.
if
the
court
is
to
accept
penry's
eighth
amendment
claim,
what
it
will
mean
is
that
mental
health
professionals,
rather
than
the
courts,
will
make
these
determinations.
and
i
think
there's
some
compelling
reasons
why
this
should
not
be
so.
penry's
definition
is
based
in
large
part
on
iq
tests,
which
are
subject
to
inherent
defects.
for
instance,
it's
well
documented
these
tests
do
not
take
into
account
an
individual's
social
and
cultural
background.
and
it's
also
well
documented
that
individuals'
scores
in
these
tests
can
vary
widely.
penry's
case
illustrates
both
these
points.
he
has
been
tested
between
50
and
63.
it's
a
deviation
of
more
than
25
percent.
and
there
was
also
testimony
at
trial
that
his
deprived
background
contributed
to
his
low
score.
penry's
reliance
on
thompson
v.
oklahoma
we
believe
is
misplaced.
the
rule
announced
in
thompkins...
excuse
me,
your
honors...
in
thompson
was
based
on
the
entirely
objective
test
of
chronological
age.
here
penry's
test
is
based
on
iq
scores
and
medical
diagnoses,
which
are
necessarily
subjective,
and
as
such
we
would
submit
are
inappropriate
for
a
bright
line
constitutional
rule.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
yes,
your
honor,
and
in
between
those
two
occasions
at
the
guilt/innocence
phase
of
trial
in
determining
whether
or
not
he
was
suffering
from
a
mental
defect
such
as
to
render
him
in...
insane
under
texas
law.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i
don't--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--uh-hum.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
well,
but
as
the
system
is
now
in
operation,
your
honor,
the
jury
or
judge
decides
based
on
the
legal
tests
that
this
court
has
propounded
for
competency,
sanity
and
the
deliberateness
test
under
texas
law.
what
penry
seeks
to
do
is
put
a...
yet
another
test,
which
is
totally
a
clinical
test,
not
a
legal
test,
and,
and
have
that
the,
the
relevant
consideration
for
sentencing
purposes.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
well,
your
honor,
i
concede--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--i
concede
it
because
there's
no
testimony
to
the
contrary
in
the
record.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
and
no
witness
testified
to
the
contrary
for
the
state.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
penry's
second
claim--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
it
was
relevant
to
his
sanity
defense.
i
think
it
was
relevant
to
the
deliberateness
issue.
but
the
state
psychiatrists
testify
that
even
though
he
was
retarded--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--well,
i
think...
again,
your
honor,
this...
this
was
penry's
evidence
not
mine.
i'm,
i'm
not
arguing
that
it,
it
should
be
binding
on,
on
this
court
or
that
it
should
have
been
binding
on
the
jury.
i'm
simply
advising
the
court
what's
in
the
record.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
certainly,
your
honor.
i,
i
think...
the
testimony
about
penry
having
the
mind
of
a
six-year
old
or
functioning
as
a
nine-year
old
is
one
extremely
isolated
part
of
a
great
deal
of
psychiatric
evidence,
the,
the
brunt...
the...
of
which
went
to
the
legal
issues
before
the
court.
so,
perhaps
the
court
could
have
stricken
the
part
about
a
six-year
old
and
let
the
rest
in,
and
that
would
have
been
permissible.
i
don't
know,
but
i,
i
don't
understand
that
to,
to
be
an
issue
here
today.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
and--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--yes.
and...
and
we
certainly
don't
claim
to
the
contrary.
penry's
second
claim
concerns
the
jury's
refusal
of
his
instructions
at
the
punishment
phase
of
trial.
in
penry's
opening
brief
in
this
court,
he
disavowed
any
intent
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
texas
statute
or
to
have
this
court
overrule
jurek.
after
listening
to
mr.
mason
today,
i...
i'm
not
sure
that
he's
adhering
to
that
position.
but
as
the
question
was
framed
in
the
cert
petition
and
as
is
framed
in
his
brief,
it...
it
deals
with
the
refusal
of
these
jury
instructions
at
the
penalty
phase
of
trial,
which
he
says
prevented
the
jury
from
considering
mitigating
evidence
and
thereby
undermined
the
fundamental
fairness
of
the
trial.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
well,
your
honor,
first
of
all,
i...
well,
i
think
the
issue
of
his
abusive
childhood...
the
evidence
of
that
would
go
not
just
to
the
deliberateness
issue
but
to
the
second
and
third
issues
also.
for
instances
counsel
argued...
defense
counsel
argued
at
the
punishment
phase
the
evidence
was
relevant
to
all
three
issues.
and
they
focused
naturally
enough
on
the
deliberateness
issue.
but
they
also
referred
to
the
fact
that
penry
had
been
placed
in
institutions
as
a
child
and
had
been
withdrawn
from
those
institutions
after
a
brief
period
and
returned
to
his
abusive
home
environment,
and
thereby
suggesting
to
the
jury
that
if
he
were
sentenced
to
life
and
placed
in
a
controlled
environment
such
as
prison,
that
perhaps
he
would
not
be
a
danger
to
others.
but
i
think
even
more
than
that
second
issues,
the...
the
evidence
would
have
gone
to
the
first
issue
of
deliberateness.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
no,
it
couldn't,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
think
it
was
proper
to
consider
moral
culpability
apart
from
the
special
issues.
as
your
honor
pointed
out
in
your
concurrence
in
california
v.
brown,
it
is
a
belief
long-held
by
this
society
that
persons
such
as
penry
with
disadvantaged
backgrounds
are
less
morally
blameworthy.
the
12
members
of
this
jury
who
sat
on
this
case
were
every
bit
as
much
members
of
this
society
as
everyone
in
this
courtroom
today,
and
as
such,
they
required
no
instruction
to
tell,
them
about
a
belief
long-held
by
this
society
and
necessarily
by
themselves.
in
addition,
as
your
honor
suggested
again
in
california
v.
brown,
moral
culpability
must
take
into
account
some
nexus
between
the
evidence
and
between
the
defendant's
actions
in
committing
the
crimes,
and
there
was
nothing
offered
in
that
regard
in
this
case.
penry
laid
out
in
extensive
detail
how
he
had
been
treated
as
a
child
and
all
the
psychiatric
evidence
pertaining
to
his
mental
status.
and
certainly
he
argued
at
length
how
his
mental
status
affected
his
actions
whether
or
not
he
was
suffering
from
mental
defect,
whether
or
not
he
acted
deliberately.
but
he
made
no
effort
and,
indeed,
today
in
argument
and
in...
and
in
his
brief
in
this
court
has
he
ever
suggested
how
the
abusive
childhood
contributed
to
his
acts
in
the
rape/murder
for
which
he
is
now
under
sentence
of
death.
although
penry
made
a
number
of
objections
to
the
court's
charge,
those
objections
contained
only
one
requested
instruction,
where
he
asked
that
the
jury
be
told
to
consider
all
the
evidence
whether
aggravating
or
mitigating
in
nature.
well,
the
charge
which
the
court
actually
gave
the
jury
was
that
it
was
to
consider
all
the
evidence
submitted
at
both
phases
of
trial.
penry's
requested
instruction
differed
only
in
that
it
added
the
phrase
"whether
aggravating
or
mitigating
in
nature."
it
added
nothing
to
the
charge
the
court
gave.
now,
justice
kennedy
suggested
that
perhaps
penry's
dilemma
might
have
been
solved
by
an
additional
instruction
which
said
even
though
you
find
the
answers
to
these
special
issues
to
be
yes,
would
you,
based
on
what
you've
heard,
sentence
him
to
life
rather
than
death?
but
that
was
not
an
instruction
which
he
requested
and
was
not
even
the
substance
of
any
of
the
other
objections
which
he
made.
he
made...
there...
he
made
13
objections
which
were
overruled.
only
six
are
at
issue
here
today:
the
one
i've
just
mentioned,
three
others
dealing
with
the
definitions
of
statutory
terms,
and
two
additional
ones.
his
objection
number
10,
where
he
asked
for
a
discretionary
grant
of
mercy...
that
was
refused
and
properly
so
i
would
submit.
there's
no
authority
of
this
court
which
supports
it,
and
it
is
contrary
to
the
court's
reasoning
in
california
v.
brown.
the
last
remaining
instruction
penry
asked
for
was
number
13,
that
the
state
be
required
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
aggravating
circumstances
outweigh
the
mitigating
circumstances.
again,
there
is
no
decision
of
this
court
which
supports
the
requested
instruction
and,
in
fact,
it
is
directly
contrary
to
the
court's
holding
in
zant
v.
stephens.
if
penry
is
complaining
about
the
jury
instructions,
we
would
submit
that
they
fail
based
on
the
authorities
i've
just
discussed.
if
penry
is
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
the
texas
special
issues,
which
i
did
not
understand
until
today
that
he
was
doing,
we
would
submit
that
that
argument
should
be
rejected
for
two
reasons,
the
first
being
that
the
texas
special
issues
adequately
channeled
the
jury's
consideration
to
relevant
sentencing
considerations,
and
that
the
mitigating
evidence
he
offered
had
no
relevance
outside
those
sentencing
considerations.
i've
heard
it
said
a
number
of
times
here
today
in
mr.
mason's
argument
that
they
had
relevance
outside
the
issues,
and
just...
judge
reavley
said
as
such
in
his
opinion
in
the
court
below.
yet,
no
one,
judge
reavley,
mr.
mason,
nor
the
numerous
amici,
have
suggested
any
relevance
whatsoever
other
than
they
might
allow
a...
a
discretionary
grant
of
mercy.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
he
did.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
he
did,
well,
he
did
not
request
the
instruction.
he
objected
to
the
charge
for
failure
to
give...
give
such--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--i...
i
believe
substantially
the
same,
yes,
your
honor.
in
lowenfield,
the
court
made
it
clear
that
all
capital
sentencing
statutes
don't
have
to
work
the
same,
that
the...
the
same
end
of
reliability
and
even-handedness
in
sentencing
can
be
accomplished
through
more
than
one
statutory
vehicle.
and
in
texas,
the
narrowing
of
the
class
takes
place
initially
at
the
guilt/innocence
phase.
under
the
constitution
and
this
court's
decisions,
texas
is
not
required
to
narrow
the
class
any
further.
and
yet
it
goes
further
than
that
by
submitting
these
special
issues
to
further
narrow
the
class
and
ensure
that
only
those
convicted
of
the
most
horrible
crimes
are
given
the
death
penalty.
what
penry
is
essentially
doing
is
turning
this
further
narrowing
which
inures
to
his
benefit
on
its
head
and
arguing
that
it
prevents
the
consideration
of
mitigating
evidence.
yet,
none
of
the
authorities
upon
which
he
relies
support
that
proposition.
lockett,
eddings,
hitchcock,
skipper,
all
of
those
dealt
with
either
court
instructions
or
statutes
which
specifically
provided
that
certain
things
were
not
to
be
considered.
we,
we
do
not
have
that
in
this
case
and,
in
fact,
what
we
have
is
a
jury
instruction
telling
the
jury
to
consider
everything.
and
we
have
no
ruling
of
the
court
excluding
evidence
in...
as
in
skipper
and
no
ruling
of
the
court
circumscribing
the
argument
of
defense
counsel
in
this
regard.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
are
you
referring
to
the
evidence
of
mental
retardation,
your
honor,
or
the
abusive
childhood?
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
well,
it
is
often
true
in
a
variety
of
contexts
in
criminal
trials
that,
that
evidence
may
work
to
the
benefit
or
the
detriment
of
a
defendant,
and
i
think--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--well,
your
honor,
i...
with
all
due
respect,
i
disagree
with
your
interpretation
of
eddings.
there
is
a
statement
in
eddings
to
the
effect
that...
that
nothing
in
that
decision
is...
is
to
impinge
on
the
jury's
freedom
to
weigh
the
evidence
as
they
see
fit.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
and
i
think
the
evidence
we're...
we're
dealing
with
here
is
no
different
from--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
well,
i
believe
they
can.
they...
they
can
look
at
this
and
say,
my
god,
this
boy
was
treated
so
badly.
it
has
got
to
have
had
an
effect
on
him.
he
couldn't
possibly
have
been
deliberate
in
his
conduct.
or
they've
got
to
say
this
boy
has
been
treated
so
badly
that
he
has
turned
out
the
way
he
has
and
he
can't
function
in
society.
but
maybe
if
we
look
him
up
for
life,
he
won't
be
a
future
danger.
i,...
i
think
what's
important
to
realize
is
that
penry's
evidence
is
really
no
different
from
other
kinds
of
evidence
that
will
cut
both
ways.
for
instance,
a
capital
murder
defendant
may
have
been
under
the
influence
of
drugs
at
the
time
of
the
offense,
and
certainly
he
can
offer
that
in
mitigation.
by
the
same
token,
the
jury
can
take
that
evidence
to
mean
that
this
person
is
a
drug
abuser
and
given
a
chance,
he'll,
he'll
abuse
drugs
again
and
commit
these
sorts
of
acts.
so,
really
what
we
have
here
is,
is
no,
no
different
than
what
occurs
in...
in
criminal
trials
throughout
this
country
on
a
daily
basis
where
defendants
face
difficult
choices
about
whether
or
not
they
should
present
certain
evidence.
for
instance,
defendants
may
wish
to
take
the
stand
and
deny
commission
of
the
offense,
and
yet
they
know
if
they
do
so,
it
exposes
them
to
impeachment
through
their
prior
convictions
and...
and
through
other
sorts
of
evidence.
in
penry's
case
he,
he
made
the
election
to
present
the
evidence.
and,
and
we
would
submit
to
the
court
that
the
texas
special
issues
do
provide
for
its
consideration.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
well,
your
honor,
when
a
defendant
takes
the
stand
and
says
i'm
going
to
be
a
future
danger,
he
essentially
answers
the
question
himself.
that's...
that's
tantamount
to
a
confession
to
the
crime.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
and...
well,
but
i
think
what...
what's
important
here
is
to
make
a
distinction
between
remorse,
culpable
testimony
that
even
though
i'm
remorseful,
i'm
going
to
go
out
and
kill
again,
and
remorse
to
the
effect
that
i
am
going
to
make
every
effort
to
better
myself
and
no
do
this
sort
of
thing
again.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
we
would
ask
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
be
affirmed.
