unknown
speaker
well,
now,
may
i
ask
what
definition
of
the
term
"deliberately"
would
in
your
view
have
met
the
requirements
that
you
urge
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
define
it.
unknown
speaker
how
would
you
do
it?
unknown
speaker
you
would
kind
of
introduce
the
old
durham
test
from
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
then
in...
as
a
constitutional
requirement
to
decide
whether
someone
is
deliberate?
unknown
speaker
the
court
would--
unknown
speaker
--well,
the
court
hasn't
tried
to...
this
court
hasn't
tried
to
define
it.
perhaps
we
should
leave
it
to
the
jury.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
we
mean
by
all
relevant
mitigating
evidence?
suppose,
for
example,
a
particular
defendant
has
had
a
childhood
in
which
he
was
subject
to
child
abuse.
would,
would
a
jury
have
to
consider
that?
suppose
a
particular
state
says
that's...
we
don't
consider
that
relevant
mitigating
evidence.
we
think
it's
only
if
it
somehow
impaired
the
define
what's
relevant
mitigating
evidence?
unknown
speaker
the
court
would--
unknown
speaker
--well,
the
court
hasn't
tried
to...
this
court
hasn't
tried
to
define
it.
perhaps
we
should
leave
it
to
the
jury.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
we
mean
by
all
relevant
mitigating
evidence?
suppose,
for
example,
a
particular
defendant
has
had
a
childhood
in
which
he
was
subject
to
child
abuse.
would,
would
a
jury
have
to
consider
that?
suppose
a
particular
state
says
that's...
we
don't
consider
that
relevant
mitigating
evidence.
we
think
it's
only
if
it
somehow
impaired
the
individual's
mental
capacity.
unknown
speaker
what
if
a
state
said
that?
would
that
comply
with
our
decisions?
unknown
speaker
what
do
we
mean
by
relevant
mitigating
evidence
if
we
don't
mean
mitigating
evidence
that
is
relevant
under
the
state
law?
relevant
under
what
else
then
would
it
be?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
do
you
say
that?
why
do
you
say
that?
once
you...
once
you
say
the
state
won't
set
the
limits,
why
can't
i
feel
sorry
for
somebody
because
he's
already
had
three
brothers
who
have
been...
who
have
been
executed,
and
i
feel
sorry
for
him?
he's
the
last
of
the
family,
and
his
mother
will
be...
why
can't
that
be
relevant
mitigating
evidence
if
i
feel
like
it,
unless
the
state
tells
me
it's
not?
unknown
speaker
i
think
you're
saying
that
we
decide
what's
relevant
mitigating
evidence.
the
term
"relevant"
means
relevant
in
the
view
of
this
court,
and,
and
our
view
is
that
it
has
to
relate
to
the...
to
the
character,
to
the--
unknown
speaker
--acts
of
the
defendant.
unknown
speaker
just
to
make...
just
to
make
one
point
clear,
mr.
mason,
you
don't
dispute
the
fact
that
all
relevant
mitigating
evidence
that
was
offered
was,
in
fact,
received
though.
unknown
speaker
so,
so
you
want
an
instruction
that
if
on
balance,
after
considering
all
of
the
mitigating
evidence,
you
in
your
discretion
think
that,
from
the
standpoint
of
your
own
conscience,
this
person
should
not
be
sentenced
to
death,
that
you
are
to...
that
you
are
to
give
this...
not
give
the
capital
sentence?
unknown
speaker
based
on
what
standard?
based
on
what
the
individual
thinks
of
moral
culpability?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
define
moral
culp...
culpability?
unknown
speaker
none
of
those
terms
are
defined
in
our
cases
to
date,
are
they?
unknown
speaker
except
in
hitchcock,
it
couldn't
have
been
considered
for
any
purpose
at
all,
and
here
the,
the
assertion
is
that
it
could
be
considered
for
purposes
of
whether
his
act
was
deliberate
as
the
charge
to
the
jury
required.
i,
i...
i'm
sure--
unknown
speaker
--you
appreciate,
mr.
mason,
the
problem
with
just
saying
throw
it
all
to
jury
and
whatever...
whatever
you
think
is
mitigating,
allow
that
to
be
mitigating.
it's,
it's
ironic.
we
got
into
this
business
in
furman
in
order
to
try
to
bring
some
order
into...
into
the
imposition
of
the
capital...
capital
penalty.
we,
we
were
worried
that
it
seemed
arbitrary,
and
there
was
no
rhyme
nor
reason
to
who
got
it
and
who
didn't
get
it.
and
now...
now
you
want
us
to
give
it
to
the...
you
say
it
must
be
given
to
the
jury
without
any...
any
channelling
instruction.
just
whatever
you
think
deserves
mitigation,
so
be
it,
so
that
you'll
get
widely
disparate
results
depending
on
what
a
particular
jury
thinks
is,
is
worth
mitigation.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
asserting
here
that
it
couldn't
be
considered
at
all
or
only
that
it
only
could
be
considered
for
deliberateness?
surely
it
could
have
been
considered
on
the
point
of
deliberateness,
couldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
just
another
way
of
making
your
argument
that
the
jury
ought
to
have
open-ended
discretion.
unknown
speaker
it
isn't?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
mean
something
the
juror
thinks
relevant?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
you've
decided
not
to
argue
the
point
that
a
mentally
retarded
person
cannot
be
executed?
unknown
speaker
you're
arguing
just
this
case
now?
unknown
speaker
suppose
there
are
degrees
of
mental
retardation?
unknown
speaker
do,
do
you
take
it
per
se
rule
that
any
kind
of
mental
retardation
is
disqualifying
from
the
death
penalty?
unknown
speaker
isn't...
isn't
there
more
apt
to
be
debate
or
disagreement
though
about
one's
mental
age
than
one...
about
one's
chronological
age?
unknown
speaker
when
you
talk
about
age,
you...
you
don't
want--
unknown
speaker
--you
don't
want
us
to
consider
penry
as
a
nine-year
old,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
there's
difference...
there's
a
great
difference
between
him
and
someone
who
is
chronologically
nine
years
old,
is
there
not?
unknown
speaker
and
that
difference
can
be--
unknown
speaker
--and
that
difference
can
be
taken--
unknown
speaker
--into
account
for
purposes
of
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
say
that?
why--
unknown
speaker
--does
it
go
to
moral
worth
too?
are
people
who
are
less
intelligent...
i
suppose,
if
they...
if
they
can't
be
morally
blameworthy,
they
also
can't
be
as...
quite
as
morally
virtuous
as...
as
more
intelligent
people.
is,
is,
is
that
true?
is,
is,
moral--
unknown
speaker
--is
moral
culpability--
unknown
speaker
--well,
now
wait.
you're
not
saying
that
he
didn't
know
how
to
conform
his
actions
to...
are
you...
he
knew
the--
unknown
speaker
--difference
between
right
and
wrong.
he
would
have
gotten
off
on
an
insanity
defense
if
that
wasn't
case.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
mason.
mr.
palmer,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
pronouncing
voir
dire
in
this.
unknown
speaker
mr.
palmer,
can
i
interrupt
you
because
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
the
thrust
of
your
argument?
you,
you
tell
us
in
very
unpleasant
and
disturbing
facts,
of
course,
that
indicate
that
this
man
was
a
very
dangerous
man.
and...
but
are
you
making
the
point
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
was
not
mentally
retarded
and
therefore
we
don't
have
the
issue
before
us
of
whether
there
can
be
an
execution
of
a
mentally
retarded
person?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean,
there
are
seven-year
olds
who
know
what
they're
doing
and
nine-year
olds
who
know
what
they're
doing.
is
that...
does
it
mean
that...
are
you
willing
to
accept
for
purposes
of
our
decision
that
this
is
a
person
with
a
mental
age
of
seven,
eight
or
nine?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
but
not
that
he...
but
not
that
he
is
in
all
respects
like
a
person
seven,
eight
or
nine.
unknown
speaker
well,
i,
i
don't...
i
don't
know
what
it
means
to
have
a
mental...
what
does
it
mean
to
have
a
mental
of
seven,
eight
or
nine?
do,
do
all
portions
of
the...
of
the
brain
in
a
retarded
person...
are
they
all
retarded
equivalently?
i
gather
there
are
different
portions
that
perform
different
functions.
i
have
no
idea--
unknown
speaker
--what
it
means
to
say
that
someone
has
a
mental
age
of
nine.
all
his...
all
his
intellectual
functions
are
at
a
nine-year
old's
level
or
just
some
of
them
or
just
those
that
are
tested
by
an
iq
test
or
what?
what
do
you
mean
by
he
has
a
mental
age
of
nine?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
it
his,
his
mental
capacity
was
considered
both
in
determining
whether
he
was
competent
to
stand
trial
and
in
determining
the
cellberateness
and
intention
at
his
actions?
unknown
speaker
but
then,
mr.
palmer,
the...
the
psychiatrists
or
whoever
it
was
that
testified...
they
didn't
decide
the
issue.
they
testified
and
the
jury
disagreed
with
them.
they
could
disagree
i
suppose
on
this
issue
too.
unknown
speaker
you...
you
suggested
earlier
that
if
we
ruled
against
you
on
this
issue,
that
would
mean
we'd
turn
the
trials
over
to
the
psychiatrists.
unknown
speaker
it
would
mean
that
they
would
be
allowed
to
testify,
but
the
jury
and
the
judge
would
still
decide
whether
to
believe
their
testimony.
unknown
speaker
let's
say
you,
you
confuse
the
issue
for
he
a
little
bit
by,
by...
by
conceding
that,
that...
that
he
has
a
mental
age
of
nine,
but
then
saying
you
have
no
idea
what
it
means
to
have
a
mental
age
of
nine.
unknown
speaker
why
should
you
concede
it
if...
if
it
doesn't
have
any
meaning
for
you?
unknown
speaker
what
you're
conceding
really
is
that
a
witness
on
his
behalf
testified
to
this
effect.
unknown
speaker
well,
do...
do
you
think
that
testimony
was...
should
have
been
stricken?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
was
it
relevant?
unknown
speaker
something
is
relevant
even
though
we
don't
know
what
it
means?
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
palmer,
you
would
agree
that
it
would
have
been
error
for
the
judge
to
exclude
the
evidence,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
even
just
under
lockett
and
even
under
the
texas
procedure,
which
i
think
allows
all
mitigating
evidence
to
be
offered
on
behalf
of
the
defendant,
you
would
not
disagree
that
this
at
least
qualifies
as
mitigating
evidence,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
therefore
it
was
admissible.
unknown
speaker
let
me
just
ask
you
how,
under
the
instructions
that
were
given,
a
juror
who
thought
that
penry
deliberately
killed
the
victim
here
but
nonetheless
thought
that
penry,
due
to
this
mental
retardation,
was
not
sufficiently
morally
culpable
of
what
he
did
to
deserve
the
death
penalty...
how
under
the
instructions
would
the
juror
have
fitted
that
belief
in
to
their
vote?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
the
juror
thought
that
this
is
a
very
dangerous
person,
that
there's
no
likelihood
in
the
future
that
his
conduct
will
improve,
and
that
what
he
did
was
entirely
deliberate,
but
that
taking
into
consideration
the
mental
retardation
of
the
person
that
he
wasn't
sufficiently
culpable
to
deserve
the
death
penalty?
could
that
have
been
properly
the
juror's
vote
under
the
texas
instructions?
unknown
speaker
well,
he,
he
did
ask
for
an
instruction
based
on
a
discretionary
grant
of
mercy,
did
he
not?
unknown
speaker
objection
10.
unknown
speaker
well,
under
texas
law,
is
that
the
same?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
isn't
it
true,
mr.
palmer,
that
this
evidence
under
the
three
special
verdicts,
particularly
under
the
second
one,
could
only
be
harmful
to
his
case
because
i
think
it
inevitably
would
tend
to
persuade
a
jury
that
there's
a
greater
likelihood
that
he
would
commit
more
acts
of
violence
in
the
future
and
be
a
continuing
threat
than...
and
it
couldn't
help
him
under
any
of
the
three
special
questions--
unknown
speaker
--well,
the
evidence
that,...
yes,
the...
both,
both.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
the
point...
let's...
let's
leave
it
to
the
abusive
childhood
and
all.
i
think
that
that
tends
to
indicate
a
greater
probability
of
future
wrongdoing,
doesn't
it,
which...
which
could
only
hurt
his
under
these...
under
the
limited
questions
the
jury
was
permitted
to
address?
under...
under
eddings,
this
court
has
held
that
that
must
be
offered
and
considered
as
mitigating
evidence.
but
i
don't
see
how
it
could
be
considered
as
mitigating
evidence
under
the
texas
scheme.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
they
must
be
free
to...
they
don't
have
to,
you're
right,
but
they
must
be
free
if
they
think
it's
appropriate
to
do
so
to
consider
it
mitigating
evidence.
unknown
speaker
but
they
can't
do
it
in
texas.
unknown
speaker
what
if
he
wanted...
again,
this
wouldn't
be
this
case.
but
what
if
a
defendant
wanted
to
get
on
the
stand
and
say
i
know
i
couldn't
avoid
doing
this
same
sort
of
thing
over
and
over
again?
i
have
this
compulsion
to
do
it
and
all,
but...
but
i
am
remorseful
and
i
am
trying
to...
you
know,
he
demonstrates
in
some
way
that
he
has
actual...
the
motive
to
try
and
do
well,
but
he
can't
do
it.
but
that
evidence
would
still
be
harmful
to
him
under
the
texas
system
because
it
would
fit
right
in
to
the
second--
unknown
speaker
--correct.
that's
exactly
my
point.
