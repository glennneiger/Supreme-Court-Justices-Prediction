mr.
curtis
c.
mason
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
fifth
circuit,
the
state
of
texas
conceded
that
johnny
penry
had
limited
mental
capacity
and
that
psychological
testing
supports
the
u.s.
district
court's
finding
that
he
has
the
mind
of
a
six
to
seven-year
old
child.
in
addition
to
this,
the
evidence
in
the
record
is
that
johnny
penry
was
severely
abused
as
a
child,
that
he
was
in
and
out
of
state
mentally
retarded
institutions,
and
that
as
a
teenager
he
was
victimized
by
older
males.
this
is
the
type
of
evidence,
relevant
mitigating
evidence,
that
has
a
relevance
beyond
the
three
texas
special
issues
that
were
submitted
to
the
jury
that
had
to
be
answered
yes
or
no.
in
penry
v.
state,
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
rejected
the
argument
that
the
terms
and
the
three
texas
special
issues
should
have
been
defined
so
that
the
jury
could
have
taken
into
consideration
relevant
mitigating
evidence.
after
rejecting
this
argument
and
saying
the
terms
are
to
be
given
their
usual,
common
meaning
without
even
trying
to
show
how
given
their
common
meaning,
these
three
special
issues...
how,
how
penry's
mitigating
evidence
could
be
considered
in
these
three
special
issues.
and
then
they
concluded
that
the
three
special
issues
were
not
unconstitutional
because
they
did
not
provide
a
provision
for
the
jury
to
say,
considering
the
mitigating
evidence,
penry
does
not
deserve
to
die.
under
the
interpretation
of
these
special
issues
given
by
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals,
in
the
words
of
circuit
judge
reavley,
what
is
a
jury
going
to
be
able
to
do
if
they
decide
that,
based
upon
the
evidence,
the
answer
to
these
three
special
issues
should
be
yes,
but
after
considering
all
of
the
relevant
mitigating
evidence,
a
juror
believes
that
johnny
penry
did
not
have
the
moral
culpability
required
for
him
to
be
deserving
of
receiving
the
death
penalty?
what
is
that
juror
to
do?
how
can
he
say
no
to
any
of
those
questions
and
still
uphold
the
oath
he
gave
when
he
swore
that
he
would
answer
those
three
special
issues
based
upon
the
evidence?
in
roberts
v.
louisiana,
this
court
held...
a
plurality
opinion...
this
court
held
that
having
to
rely
upon
jury
nullification
was
not
an
adequate
method
for
a
jury
to
take
into
consideration
mitigating
evidence.
the
second
question
for
which
cert
was
granted
in
this
court
can
be
briefly
summarized...
the
argument
supporting
it
can
be
briefly
summarized
by
this
one
sentence.
if
it
is
given
that
the
severity
of
the
punishment
should
bear
a
relationship
to
the
culpability
of
the
defendant,
then
how
can
somebody
with
the
reasoning
capacity
of
a
seven-year
old
be
determined
to
have
the
moral
culpability
to
deserve
a
sentence
of
death?
the
evidence...
in
penry's
case,
the
relevant
mitigating
evidence
is
very
similar
to
the
relevant
mitigating
evidence
that
was
in
eddings
and
in
hitchcock.
and
in
both
eddings
and
hitchcock,
this
court
reversed
those
decisions,
the
death
penalty
in
those
cases,
because
the
sentencer
had
no...
did
not
take
into
consideration
the
mitigating
evidence
when
deciding
that
eddings
or
hitchcock
should
be
given
the
death
penalty.
in
lockett--
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
--deliberate
would
have
to
be
defined
in
such
a
way
that
his
reduced
capacity
to
conform
his
acts
to
the
requirements
of
law
could
be
taken
into
consideration.
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
so,
it--
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
--i
would...
something
like
you're
instructed
that
a
person
acts
deliberately
when
his
ability
to
conform
his
actions
to
the
requirement
of
society
is
not
significantly
impaired
due
to
mental
defect
or
abused
childhood
or...
or
[inaudible]
by
abused
childhood,
something...
or
other
factors
beyond
his
control.
i
think
that
sort
of
definition
of
deliberate
would
encompass
most
of
penry's
mitigating
evidence.
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
well,
okay.
we're
trying
to
make
a
define
what's
relevant
mitigating
evidence?
no,
not
what's
relevant
mitigating
evidence.
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
this
court
has
essentially
defined
that.
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
well...
well,
okay.
however
you're
going
to
say
that.
okay.
this
court
has
said
it's
evidence
about
the
defendant's
character
or
background
or
about
the
facts
surrounding
the
commission
of
the
crime
which
would
make
a
juror
want
to
consider
a
sentence
less
than
death
appropriate.
i
don't
know
if
that's
considered
a
definition
of
relevant
mitigating
evidence
or
not,
but
that's
essentially
what
i
believe
the
cases
of
this
court
say
is
relevant
mitigating
evidence.
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
no,
not
what's
relevant
mitigating
evidence.
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
this
court
has
essentially
defined
that.
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
well...
well,
okay.
however
you're
going
to
say
that.
okay.
this
court
has
said
it's
evidence
about
the
defendant's
character
or
background
or
about
the
facts
surrounding
the
commission
of
the
crime
which
would
make
a
juror
want
to
consider
a
sentence
less
than
death
appropriate.
i
don't
know
if
that's
considered
a
definition
of
relevant
mitigating
evidence
or
not,
but
that's
essentially
what
i
believe
the
cases
of
this
court
say
is
relevant
mitigating
evidence.
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
well--
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
--no,
because
that
was
one
of
the
types
of
evidence
that
was
left
out
in
eddings,
the
fact
that
when
he
went
to
live
with
his
father,
he
was
severely
punished
and
abused
by
his
father.
and
the
judge
said
i
can't
consider
that.
and
this
court
then
said
that
was
one
of
the
factors
in
eddings
that
should
have
been
considered
by
the
court
in,
in
assessing
the
death
penalty.
so--
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
--well,
any...
any
evidence
that
is
going
to
make
the
jury...
okay.
this
evidence
has
to
bear
on
the
defendant
himself,
you
know.
you
can't
just
take
something
that
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
defendant
and
say...
like
he's...
he's
got
a
poor
mother
that
doesn't
want
him
to
die,
so
don't
give
him
the
death
penalty--
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
--okay.
the...
this
court
i
think
has
said
it
has
to
do
with
the
background
or
the
record
of
the
defendant.
and...
i
think
it
was
in
lockett
that
it
was
noted
that
the
court
does
have
the...
the
trial
court
now
does
have
the
right
to
limit
the
introduction
of
evidence
that
the
trial
court
thinks
is
irrelevant.
now,
the
trial
court
in
skipper,
of
course,
tried
to
limit
some
evidence
that...
and
that...
and
that
was
reversed
because
that
was
some
relevant
evidence
about
his
background
and
behavior.
so,
i
think
this
court
has
not
left
the
trial
judge
completely
helpless,
but
if
it's
evidence
about
the
background
and
record
of
the
defendant
or
the...
or
something
surrounding
the
crime,
why
it
was
committed
and
how
it
was
committed,
then
the
court
is
going
to
have
to
let
that
in
if
it
would
be
something
that
could
be
considered
mitigating.
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
that's...
that's--
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
--that's
right,
justice
scalia.
that's
why
i
think...
well,
at
least,
that's
what
i
get
out
of
the
reading
of
your
cases
which
they
have
considered
this.
actually
in,
in
woodson,
which
started
all
of
this,
they
termed
it
relevant,
compassionate
and
mitigating
evidence.
and
from
then
on,
the
other
cases,
the
word
"compassionate"
i
think
seems
to
have
been
dropped
out,
but
from
what
they're
talking
about,
i'm
not
sure
it's
being
left
out
of
the
consideration.
it's
just
that
they
just
now
call
it
relevant
mitigating
instead
of
relevant,
compassionate
and
mitigating
evidence.
but
anything
about
the
defendant
or
the
crime
that
would
make
a
juror
consider
something
that
a
sentence
less
than
death
is
appropriate
is
something
that
they
should
be
able
to
act
upon.
and
that's
where
i
think
the
problem
is
in
the
texas
statute
is
there's
lots
of
things
that
are
appropriate
that
would
not
be
directly
related
to
answering
no
to
one
of
those
special
issues.
and,
and
this
is
relevance
beyond
the
special
issues.
and
so,
that's
where
the
texas
statute
or
the
way
it's
interpreted
by
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
comes
into
problems.
and
actually
in,
in
lockett,
the
court
phrased
it
as
that
the
trier...
or
the
sentencer
must
be
able
to
give
independent
mitigating
weight
to
this
evidence.
and
in
mills
v.
maryland,
the
opinion
said
that
near
the
statutes,
the
sentencing
court
or
evidentiary
rules
can
place
a
barrier
between
the
jury...
in
the
way
of
the
jurors'
considering...
considering
mitigating
evidence.
and
even
they
can't
place
a
barrier
in
the
way
of
a
single
hold-out
juror
in
considering
this
evidence.
brown
v.
california--
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
--no,
i
don't
dispute
that.
we
have
never
disputed
that
the...
that
they
are
keeping
evidence
from
being
introduced.
i
mean...
in
penry's
case,
in
a
recent
case
in...
that
the,
the
state
has
used
in
their
appendix,
burns
v.
state,
it
was
reversed
because
they
did
not
let
in
evidence.
the
trial
court
did
not
let
in
evidence.
but
that
still
leaves
the
problem
of
what
can
the
jury
do
with
this
evidence
once
it
gets
in
because
all
of
this
evidence
has
to
be
channeled
through
negating
one
of
these
three
special
issues.
and
there...
they
are...
there's
lots
of
mitigating
evidence
that
doesn't
readily
fit
into
negating
one
of
those
but
may
make
a
juror
consider
a
sentence
of
death...
death
inappropriate.
and
that's
where
the
problem
comes
in.
now,
in
the
plurality
opinion
in
jurek,
in
that
one,
this
court
first
noted
that
the
constitutionality
of
the
texas
statute
depends
upon
if
the
special
issues
allow
consideration
of
particularized
mitigating
factors.
then
the
plurality
opinion
went
on
to
give...
quote
examples
from
the
court
of
criminal
appeals'
opinion
in
jurek
v.
state.
and
then
they
concluded
that
it
thus
appears...
and
i
think
i'd
want
to
try
to
emphasize
the
plurality
saying
it
thus
appears...
that
the
texas
statute
like
the
florida
and
like
the
georgia
statutes
are
constitutional.
and
justice
white
in
concurring
in
that
now
did
indicate
that
the
texas
statute
did
not
allow
for
jury
discretion
and...
and
i
think
really
this
is
the
way
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
is
interpreting
the
statute.
they
are
severely
limiting
the
ability
for
a
juror
to
have
discretion
in
deciding
whether
a
sentence
less
than
death
is
appropriate
because
there
is
just
simply
no
way
that
all
relevant
mitigating
evidence
can
be
made
relevant
to
one
of
those
questions.
there
was
a
footnote
in--
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
--i
don't
think
i'd
put
in
your
own
conscience
or
anything
like
that.
i'd
just
want
the
instructions
to
say
after
considering
all
the
mitigating
evidence,
if
you
feel
that
he
does
not
have
the
moral
culpability--
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
--i,
i
think
you're
going
to
have
to
leave...
let
the
juror
have
a
certain
amount
of
discretion
in
what
their
standard
is.
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
that
would
be
something
that
makes
him...
the
defendant
less
blameworthy.
there
is
something
about
this
defendant,
the
way
he
was
raised,
the
way
his
mind
works,
the
way...
things
like
that
that
reduces
his
blameworthiness,
you
know.
there
is
some
type
of
reason
or
excuse--
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
--no.
i
think
they're...
those
are
the
types
of
things
that
i
think
you...
okay,
i'll
borrow
from
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
that
they
can
give
the...
a
common,
ordinary
meaning
to
those
terms.
otherwise,
it
would
appear
that
either
this
court
would
have
to
completely
define
it
or
would
have
to
require
some
kind
of
statue...
statutory
definition
of
those.
but
the
line
of
cases
starting
with
woodson
and
going
through
hitchcock
all
hold
that
the
juror
or
the
sentencer
must
be
able
to
consider
relevant
mitigating
evidence
before
making
that
final
decision,
this
person
should
live
or
this
person
should
die.
and
although
a
lot
of
those
are
plurality
decisions,
hitchcock
was
for
the
unanimous
court.
when
just...
justice
scalia
wrote
over
here,
it
was
a
unanimous
decision.
and
hitchcock's
mitigating
evidence
was
very
similar
to...
well,
actually
penry's
mitigating
evidence
is
stronger
than
hitchcock's
because
hitchcock's
mitigating
evidence
was
that
he
inhaled
gasoline
fumes
when
he
was
a
child
and
passed
out.
his
father
died
of
cancer
at
an
early
age,
and
his
mind
wandered
after
he
inhaled
the
gasoline
fumes.
he
was
one
of
seven
children
from
a
poor
family,
such
like
that.
that
was
the
evidence
that
was...
that
was
not
considered
in
hitchcock
and
when
it
was
reversed
because
the
sentencer
failed
to
consider
all
the
mitigating
evidence.
and
i
think
penry's
mitigating
evidence
is
a
lot
stronger
than
that.
and,
and
i
think
its
relevance
does,
in
fact,
go
beyond
those
texas
special
issues.
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
well--
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
--yes,
but
can
the
state
then
channel
it
in
such
a
way
that
the
jury
cannot
effectively
consider
it?
and,
and
again,
i
go
back
to--
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
--okay.
again,
i'll
go
back
the
circuit
judge
reavley's
statement.
what
is
the
juror
going
to
do
if
after
locking
at
the
evidence,
he
decides,
yes,
he
acted
deliberately,
but
upon
looking
at
the
evidence,
he
says
this
is
very
compelling
mitigating
evidence?
this
man
should
not
die.
he
has
the
mind
of
a
seven-year
old.
he
was
severely
abused.
he
is
not
fully
responsible
for
the
way
he
is
today.
now,
he's
not
so
bad
that
he
can't
act
deliberately,
and
i
would
submit
that
if
he
was
so
retarded
he
was
incapable
of
acting
deliberately,
he
would
be
so
retarded
that
he
would
have
never
been
considered
competent
to
be
tried
and
would
have
avoided
all
criminal
responsibility
altogether.
and
i'm
not
saying
he
should
avoid
all
criminal
responsibility.
i'm
just
saying
the
jury
needs
to
have
a
way,
when
they
have
somebody
like
penry
before
them,
to
say
i
know
the
evidence
shows
he
did
it
deliberately,
but
he
should
not
die.
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
no,
i
don't
think
that's
open-ended
discretion.
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
no,
because
it
has
to
be
some
kind...
something
relevant
to
his
character
and
personality.
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
yes,
but,
but
it
can
have
some
guidance
from...
as
to
this.
otherwise,
how
can...
okay.
how
can
the
sentencer
be
so
restricted
and
especially
when...
after
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
said
we
are
going
to
define
these
terms
in
such
a
way
that
all
this
mitigating
evidence
is
going
to
be
taken
into
consideration,
and
yet
completely
abandons
that
as
soon
as
jurek
is
decided?
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
had
two
superb
chances,
one
in
'77
and
one
in
'78
of
defining
what
deliberate
is
so
that
it
could
be
taken
into
consideration.
the
first
one
was
a
shootout
in
a
jail
in
which
one
of
the
officers
was
killed
by
a
stray
bullet
from
a
fellow
officer.
in
that
case,
the
jury
answered
no
to
the
first
special
issue,
and
the
argument
was
that
because
deliberate
and
intentional
mean
the
same
thing,
that
means
it's
inconsistent
and
he
should
have
been
found
innocent
of
capital
murder.
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
responded
not
by
showing
why
he
acted
intentionally
but
didn't
act
deliberately.
they
adopted
the
reviser's
note
and
said
all
a
no
answer
to
special
issue
number
one
means
is
the
juror
used
nullification
to
decide
he
didn't
deserve
to
die.
so,
they
just
voted
no.
the
second
time
they
had
a
chance
to
define
deliberate
in
such
a
way
that
it
could
be...
mitigating
evidence
could
be
taken
into
consideration
was
in...
i
think
that
was
nichols
v.
state.
in
this
case,
the
defendant
burglarized
a
residence,
went
in
unarmed
and
in
the
process
of
burglary
took
the
gun.
the...
the
victim
came
back
to
the
apartment,
was
armed
when
he
came
in,
pulled
his
gun,
pointed
it
at
the
burglar
and
was
about
to
shoot
him
when
the
burglar
pulled
the
gun
he
had
stolen
and
shot
one
shot,
killed
him.
his
confession
was
i
was
so
scared
i
didn't
have
the
slightest
idea
of
what
was
happening.
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
reversed
that
case,
but
it
didn't
reverse
by
finding
he
didn't
act
deliberately
even
after
though
they
said
it
wasn't
a...
well,
let
me
see
if
i
can
find
the
right
phrase
that
they
used
in
that
one.
0....
anyway,
what
they
found
in
that
case
was
that
it
wasn't...
he
didn't
really
have
a
conscious
desire
to
shoot
him.
and
then
they
reversed
on
the
second
question
based
upon
the
fact
that
since
he
really
had
not
formed
a
conscious
intent
to
shoot
the
man,
that
it
showed
he
was
not
a
danger
to
society.
they
didn't...
they
completely...
no,
pardon
me.
here's
what
they
said.
"the
facts
of
the
instant
case
reflects
a
criminal
act
of
violence,
but
it
was
not
a
calculated
act."
and
i
think
that's
a
superb
chance
for
them
to
show
the
difference
between
deliberate
and
intentional.
instead,
they
went
on
and
said
because
it
wasn't
a
calculated
act,
he
wasn't...
there
was
no
evidence
he
was
a
future
danger
and
reversed
on
question
number
two.
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
i'm
sorry.
no,
i
do
want
to
argue
that
point.
xxx.
yes,
okay.
again,
you
know,
the
basic
question
is
how
can
somebody
this
retarded
have
the
moral
culpability
to
deserve
the
death
penalty?
now,
i
would
parallel
the
argument
to
that
in
thompson,
and
i
would
specifically
go
on
justice
o'connor's
here's
concurring
opinion
as
well
as
i
think
justice
scalia's
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
well,
no.
that,
that...
right
now
i'm
arguing
that
case.
okay.
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
that's
why
i
want
to
get
into
arguing
that
case,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
no.
that's
not
what
i'm
getting
ready
to
argue,
justice
blackmun.
justice
o'connor
in
her...
in
her
concurring
opinion
said
that
there
could
be
a
consensus
of
this
court
that
there
is
some
age
below
which
a
juvenile
does
not
have
the
maturity
to
be
executed.
the
dissenting
opinion
in
thompson
now
said
we
may
go
as
far
as
saying
that
there
is
a
rebuttable
presumption
that
somebody
of
thompson's
age
could
not
be
executed.
and
then
they
went
into
the
common
law
which
said
at
the
age
of
12
or
under,
you
could
not
commit
a
capital
felony.
thirteen
and
14
there
is
a
rebuttable
presumption
that
you
could
not
commit
a
capital
felony.
i
think
a
parallel
to
that
in
mentally
retarded
cases
is
that
you
could...
there
is
some
age,
such
as
perry's,
where
there
can
be
a
consensus,
some
retardation,
some
mental
age,
let's
say,
reasoning
age,
like
he
has,
which
is
seven.
there
should
be
a
consensus
that--
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
--yes,
but
there's...
but
that
is
in...
an...
a
more
precise,
say,
way
of
determining
that
than
like
insanity.
there
are
tests.
there
are
historical
records
showing
that
he
was
mentally
retarded
as
a
child.
and
so,
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
the
way
to
go
about
it
would
probably
be
having
a
rebuttable
presumption
like
somebody
in
the
upper
mild
retarded
extending
probably
into
the
lower,
dull,
normal
rebuttable
presumption
that
they
should
not
be
executed
and
yet
then
pick
a...
an
age
where--
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
--i'm
talking
mental
age.
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
no.
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
that's
correct.
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
but--
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
--but--
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
--well,
the
cruel
and
unusual
clause
punishment
is...
where
that
comes
in
is
that
the
punishment
should
bear
some
relationship
to
moral
culpability.
and
if
you're
as
retarded
as
penry
is,
then
that
significantly
reduces
his
moral
culpability
and...
so
that
he
should
not
be
given
the
death
penalty.
that...
but
i'm
not
saying
that
he
shouldn't
be
punished.
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
because
the
death
penalty
should
be
reserved--
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
--they...
if--
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
--if
penry
was
raised
properly,
he
probably
could
have
learned
the
virtues,
but
he
would
have
had
to
have
been
raised
properly
and
he
would
have
had
to
have
been
raised
with
real
delicate
care
and
a
real
understanding
and...
so
that
he
could
learn
how
to...
to
conform
his
actions
to
society.
he
just
wasn't.
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
okay.
mr.
curtis
c.
mason
okay.
he
had
difficulty
in
conforming
his
actions.
that's
part
of
the
mental
retardation.
that...
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that's
part
of
the
definition
of
mental
retardation,
that
there
is
a
deficit
in
adaptive
behavior.
thank
you.
