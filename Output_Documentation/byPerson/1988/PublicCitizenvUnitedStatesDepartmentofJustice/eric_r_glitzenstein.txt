mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
advisory
committee
act
applies
to
entities
that
are
structured
as
committees,
that
are
established
or
utilized
for
obtaining
advice
or
recommendations
by
a
federal
agency
or
by
the
president.
we
think
that
the
structure
of
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
makes
it
plain
that
what
congress
was
attempting
to
do
with
utilized
committees,
was
cover
those
entitles
that
are
essentially
used
by
the
executive
branch
in
the
same
manner
as
committees
that
are
formally
established
by
the
executive
branch.
and,
indeed,
that
is
exactly
what
the
general
services
administration's
regulations
clarify,
spell
out.
and,
indeed,
that
is
what
the
executive
branch,
ever
since
the
enactment
of
the
advisory
committee
act,
has
basically
said
what
a
utilized
committee
means.
and
i
think
it's
useful
to
focus
on
the
gsa
regulations
because
this
is
the
interpretation
which
all
federal
agencies
are
supposed
to
comply
with.
and
under
this
court's
precedent,
it
is
the
interpretation
which
is
entitled
at
least
a
substantial
deference.
the
gs--
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
--your
honor,
there
was
an
executive
order,
i
believe
it
was
issued
in
1977
by
president
carter,
who
authorized
the
general
services
administration
to
undertake
the
function
of
providing
guidance.
and,
indeed,
that
is
consistent
with
the
statute
itself.
i
believe
it
is
section
7
of
the
law,
states
that
an
agency
should
undertake
the
function
of
providing
government-wide
guidance
and...
in
appropriate
circumstances,
rules
that
would
be
followed
by
the
other
agencies.
and,
indeed,
that
has
been
done
by
the
federal
government
ever
since
faca
was
first
enacted
in
1972.
and
interestingly,
even
before
the
statute
was
enacted,
the
executive
branch
had
issued
several
executive
orders,
which
contained
very
parallel
provisions
and
requirements,
and
coverage,
to
what
the
gsa
currently
says
the
coverage
of
the
statute
and
the
various
requirements
of
the
law
should
be.
president--
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
--your
honor,
what
gsa
does
is
essentially
take
from
each
of
the
various
agencies
those
committees
which
have
been
chartered
in
compliance
with
the
law;
and
it
puts
all
of
those
committees
together
in
an
annual
report...
we're
up
to
the
17th
annual
report
this
year...
and
submits
those
to
the
president.
then
the
president,
under
the
act,
is
required
to
take
that
list
and,
in
turn,
provide
that
to
the
relevant
committees
of
congress.
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
if
does
not
include
and
of
the
committees
which
have
not
been
chartered
under
the
law.
that
is
gsa's
cut-off
point
for
what
it
will
include
in
the
list.
in
other
words,
if
an
agency
is
not
using
a
committee
in
compliance
with
the
statute,
it
doesn't,
therefore,
come
to
gsa
and
say,
we
have
committee
x,
y
and
z,
which
has
not
been
chartered
under
the
law,
that
will
not
be
included
in
the
list.
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
your
honor,
the
gsa
guidelines
do
not
provide
for
that
particular
breakdown
and,
in
turn,
the
president's
handbook
on
the
advisory
committee
act
has
never
spelled
out
which...
which
committees
take
federal
funding
and
which
do
not.
it
does
include
both
established
and
utilized
committees.
for
the
department
of
transportation,
for
example,
it
submits
to
the
gsa
committees
that
are
pre-existing,
independent
entitles
that
are
simply
utilized
by
the
government.
so
the
department
of
the
transportation,
which
uses
a
substantial
number
of
advisory
committees,
would
include
some
that
are
not
committees
taking
federal
funds.
but
i
cannot
answer
precisely
how
many.
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
your
honor,
i--
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
--your
honor,
i
think
that
the
effort
on
the
part
of
congress
was
to
apply
the
statute
to
those
committees
that
are
being
used
in
the
same
manner
as
an
established
committee.
and
therefore,
it
doesn't
matter
so
much
whether
it's
prospective
or
whether
it's
something
which
is
on-going.
if
the
federal
government,
for
example,
were
to
establish
a
committee
and
say,
we
are
now
formally
establishing
an
advisory
committee
to
report
on
subject
x,
and
from
henceforth,
it
will
provide
recommendations
on
a
particular
subject,
say,
for
example,
ethics
in
government,
to
take
a
recent
advisory
committee
that
has
been
in
the
news,
that
would
clearly
be
subject
to
the
law.
the
question
is
whether
the
intent
is
to
use
that
committee
as
a
preferred
source
of
advice
over
a
period
of
time,
and
that
can
apply,
i
believe,
your
honor,
to
a
committee
which
is
going
to
be
used
prospectively--
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
--your
honor,
i
think
that
the
test
is
not
so
much
whether
it's
a
particular
period
of
time,
so
much
as
it
is
a
question
of
whether
on
a
particular
subject
matter
that
entity
will
be
used
as
a
preferred
source
of
advice
or
recommendation.
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
and,
indeed,
your
honor,
there
is
case
law
which
would
support
that
result.
the
national
nutritional
foods
association
case
involved
a
one-time
meeting;
the
edwards
case,
which
we
cite,
involving
a
committee
set
up
to
provide
advice
and
recommendations
which
involved
a
department
of
energy
policy
was
a
one-time
meeting.
the
focus,
again,
is
upon
the
nature
of
the
committee
and
how
it
is
being
utilized,
not
so
much
upon
the
number
of
meetings
that
are
being
held.
now
i
would
say
that
you
have
a
much
easier
case,
as
here,
where
the
committee,
over
a
significant
period
of
time,
has
performed
the
same
or
substantially
the
same
function
of
providing
advice
or
recommendations
on
a
particular
subject
matter.
and,
indeed,
that
is
precisely
what
the
gsa
regulation
said.
and
i
think
that
also
may
relate
to
a
question
that
justice
stevens
asked
before,
about
the
us
of
confidential
information.
i
think
that
a
committee
can
still
be
an
advisory
committee
if
it
doesn't
use
confidential
governmental
information.
but
if
it
does
use
confidential
governmental
information
that
the
government
does
not
otherwise
have
to
provide
to
it,
and,
indeed,
does
not
provide
to
any
other
member
of
the
public,
then
you
have
very
heavy
support
for
the
proposition
that
it
is
an
advisory
committee.
and
i
think
that
is
supported
by
the
justice
department
itself
when
it
first
looked
at
this
question
in
the
early
1970s.
and
i'm
quoting
from
a
february
1974
office
of
legal
counsel
memorandum
on
this
subject,
which
says,
"the
major
function
of
the
aba
committee
is
to
provide
to
this
department
advice
as
to
the
qualifications
of
persons
being
considered
for
federal
judgeships."
"a
semi-official
relationship
has
been
established."
"the
committee
obtains
confidential
information
from
the
department,
without
which
the
committee
could
not
function."
"in
effect,
the
department
solicits
the
committee's
views;
the
committee
could
not
judge
the
qualifications
of
prospective
nominees
without
its
special
relationship
with
the
department."
and
i
think
the
point
being
made,
justice
stevens,
was
that
where
an
agency
goes
to
a
committee
or
an
entity
and
says,
here
is
otherwise
confidential
information.
we
would
like
your
views
on
that
subject.
it
certainly
supports
the
proposition
that
the
government
is
intending
to
use
that
entity
as
an
advisory
committee.
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
well,
your
honor,
in
terms
of--
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
--it
functioned,
but
not
in
this
sense.
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
it
did
not
function
as
an
advisory
committee
in
the
sense
that
it
obtained
information
from
the
government
and
was
asked
to
participate
in
that
process.
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
your
honor,
i
think
the
statutory
emphasis,
once
again,
is
the
parallel
between
established
committees
and
utilized
committees.
and
that's
not
to
say
that
every
established
committee
is
necessarily
obtaining
confidential
information.
but
i
think
the
notion
was,
when
the
government
establishes
a
very
unique
relationship
with
a
particular
entity
and
says,
we're
providing
you
with
this
information
so
that
you
can
advise
us,
that
suggests
that
you
do
have
strong
support
for
an
advisory
committee.
i'm
not
saying,
once
again,
your
honor,
that
that
is
the
only
criteria
that
is
relevant
to--
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
--i
agree
with
your
honor,
even
if
the
aba
committee
did
not
get
confidential
information,
it
would
fall
within
the
terms
of
the
statute.
the
only
point
i'm
trying
to
make,
and
i
don't
want
to
carry
it
too
far,
is
that
where
they
go
even
further
than
that,
that,
in
our
minds,
resolves
and
doubt
on
this
score,
and
suggests
that
you
clearly
have
the
government
admitting
that
it
is
seeking
this
information
as...
advice...
as
a
preferred
source
of
advice.
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
your
honor,
i
think,
once
again,
and
this
has
been
spelled
out,
not
only
by
gsa,
but
also
by
omb
when
it
had
this
authority
in
the
early
'70s,
by
the
justice
department
itself,
and
even
prior
to
that
by
executive
orders
which
were
very
similar
to
the
approach
taken
by
gsa,
that
the
question
is,
is
it
being
used
in
a
manner
which
is
similar
to
an
established
committee?
does
it
have
fixed
membership?
does
it
have
a
structure
as
a
committee?
is
it
being
asked
to
provide
advice
or
recommendations
on
particular
issues
over...
at
a
particular
point
in
time?
and,
does
it
have
all
those
kinds
of
criteria?
and
i
think
you
will
have
to
ask
that
question
with
respect
to
each
committee.
if
i
might
turn
quickly
to
the
constitutional
argument,
because
i
think
it
is
something
which
is
addressed
significantly
in
the
briefs.
the
most
important
point
i
would
like
to
make
about
it
is
that
this
is
a
law
which
has
been
in
effect
for
17
years
now,
and
which
hundreds,
indeed,
thousands
of
advisory
committees,
some
which
are
very
similar
to
the
aba
committee,
peer
review
committees
of
the
national
science
foundation,
the
national
institutes
of
health,
have
complied
with.
it's
a
statute
which
builds
into
it
a
significant
amount
of
flexibility
in
application
by
the
executive
branch.
and
perhaps
the
most
important
point
that
i
would
make
on
that
score
involves
the
exemptions
to
the
open
meeting
and
the
open
document
provisions.
in
essence,
what
the
statute
says
is
that
where
meetings
or
documents
would
fall
within
exemption
to
the
freedom
of
information
act
or
the
sunshine
act
for
meetings,
that
material
can
be
protected.
the
justice
department,
in
the
early
1970s,
and
i
don't
think
really
disputes
at
this
stage
of
the
game,
that
the
exemption
in
the
statute
for
personal
privacy
material,
which
this
court
handed
down
opinion
on
in
the
foia
context
just
a
few
weeks
ago,
would
apply
to
the
majority,
if
not
all,
of
the
specific
discussions
of
individual
candidates
for
federal
judgeships.
we
would
submit
that
the
statute
clearly
allows
the
aba
to
function
in
a
manner
that
is
consistent
with
any
genuine
need
for
confidentiality.
on
the
other
hand,
where
there
are
discussions
of
matters
which
do
not
fall
within
the
exemptions,
then
presumably
those
could
be
open
to
the
public.
to
take
an
example,
a
general
discussion
by
the
committee
as
to
the
role
that
political
ideology
may
play
in
its
deliberations
is
something
which
would
not
appear
to
fall
within
any
of
the
exemptions.
surely
the
justice
department
would
have
the
opportunity
to
argue
that
it
does,
but
assuming
that
it
doesn't
there
has
not
been
a
single
word
expressed
in
any
of
the
briefs
that
that
kind
of
meeting,
a
general
discussion
of
role,
of
function,
of
criteria,
of
procedure,
would,
in
fact,
need
to
be
protected
under
the
statute.
to
take
another
one
of
the
statute's
very
basic
threshold
requirements,
that
of
filing
a
charter.
that's
contained
in
section
9(c)
of
the
law.
the
fundamental
purpose
of
that
provision
is
to
have
the
agency
that's
using
a
committee
set
out
the
agency's
statement
as
to
why
it's
using
the
committee.
now
we
all
know,
and
the
record
in
this
case
suggests,
that
there
has
been
some
confusion
as
to
exactly
what
the
aba
committee's
role
in
the
process
is.
and,
more
importantly,
what
the
justice
department's
position
on
what
the
role
of
that
process
is.
and
a
charter,
which
would
spell
out
the
justice
department's
statement
as
to
why
the
committee
is
being
used,
whether,
for
example,
it
is
supposed
to
be
considering
ideology,
whether
it's
supposed
to
be
considering
political
views,
and,
if
not,
whether,
indeed,
it
is
supposed
to
provide
an
ultimate
recommendation
for
whether
someone
should
be
put
on
the
court.
all
that
could
be
spelled
out
in
a
charter.
there
is
no
reason,
in
any
of
the
briefs,
why
that
kind
of
material
should
not
be
made
available
to
the
public.
