mr.
david
l.
shapiro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
not
whether
it
is
a
good
idea
or
a
bad
idea
for
the
president
and
his
judicial
selection
committee
to
rely,
as
presidents
have
relied
for
some
35
years,
on
the
council
of
the
aba
committee
when
it
comes
to
judicial
nominations.
the
questions,
rather,
are
whether,
in
enacting
the
federal
advisory
committee
act
in
1972,
congress
intended
to
intrude,
to
regulate
that
relationship,
and
if
it
did,
whether
that
intrusion
is
consistent
with
the
constitutional
separation
of
powers
and,
in
particular,
with
the
president's
function
to
nominate
officers
of
the
united
states.
the
answers
to
both
questions,
we
submit,
is
no.
the
answer
to
the
first
question,
that
of
statutory
construction,
is
no
because
the
long-standing
and
well
known
relationship
between
the
executive
and
this
private
group,
with
respect
to
the
exercise
of
the
nominating
power,
was
wholly
outside
the
scope
of
congress'
interests
and
concerns
when
the
enacted
the
advisory
committee
act.
and
the
answer
to
the
second
question,
the
question
of
constitutionality,
is
no
because
if
the
act
applies
to
this
relationship,
the
resulting
constraint
on
the
president's
ability
to
seek
advice
from
whomever
he
chooses,
and
in
whatever
manner
he
chooses
on
this
matter
would
be
an
unconstitutional
invasion
of
his
discretion
on
a
subject
on
which
he
is
accountable,
not
to
the
congress
or
to
the
judiciary,
but
solely
to
the
electorate
through
the
political
process
and
to
his
own
conscience.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
your
honor--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--your
honor,
the
case
has
the
quality
of
a
facial
challenge.
unfortunately,
it
seems
to
us,
both
inappropriate,
undesirable,
and
inconsistent
with
the
statute,
to
have
a
trial
run
to
see
how,
in
fact,
it
operates.
but
i
do
believe
that
it's
essential,
especially
because
this
is
the
first
occasion
on
which
this
court
has
considered
the
meaning
and
scope
of
this
statute,
even
though
it's
been
on
the
books
for
some
17
years.
i
think
it's
appropriate,
at
least,
to
spell
out
what
we
believe
the
significant
and
inescapable
impacts
would
be.
and
for
the
court,
then,
to
determine,
in
the
light
of
those
impacts,
both
the
question
of
statutory
construction
and
the
constitutional
issue.
there
are
a
number
of
very
difficult
questions
of
statutory
construction
posed
by
this
statute.
i
don't
think
they
need
all
to
be
resolved
in
order
to
make
these
threshold
determinations
of
what
significant
impact
the
statute
would
have.
because
regardless
of
how
they
are
resolved,
if
the
statute
is
held
applicable
to
the
committee,
there
would
be,
i
think,
four
direct,
immediate
and
significant
impacts.
first,
there
would
have
to
be
a
designated
federal
officer
who
would
have
to
attend
each
and
every
meeting
of
the
advisory
committee.
this
federal
officer
would
have
the
authority
to
call
those
meetings,
to
adjourn
those
meetings,
and,
we
believe,
would
also
have,
under
the
statute,
control
over
the
agenda.
so
the
immediate
result
would
be
that
the
committee
would
lose
a
good
deal
of
its
private
autonomy
and
would
become
subject
to
a
significant
measure
of
federal
control.
secondly--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
it
would
be
a
government
official
who
would
be
appointed
by
the
justice
department,
so
long
as
the
committee
were
working
with
the
justice
department.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
your
honor,
we
believe
that
it
fundamentally
affects
the
relationship
between
what,
up
to
now
has
been,
the
executive
on
the
one
hand,
and
a
purely
private
group
on
the
other.
so
that
the
process,
which...
of
which
this
is
just
one
part,
the
process
of
essentially
federalizing
that
private
group,
there
are
other
aspects
of
which
that
will
happen,
seems
to
us,
will
dramatically
affect
the
relationship,
will
dramatically
affect
the
extent
to
which
the
president,
acting
through
his
judicial
selection
committee,
can
seek
outside,
private
help
in
this
matter.
because
not
only
is
there
a
designated
federal
officer,
there
is,
under
the
statute,
a
designated
management
officer,
whose
job
will
be
to
take
custody,
to
keep
control
of,
all
the
records
of
this
advisory
committee;
not
simply
the
records
of
communications
from
the
advisory
committee
to
the
executive,
but
the
records
of
the
records
of
the
advisory
committee
itself,
the
internal
records
of
the
advisory
committee
itself.
again,
an
effort
we
believe
towards
federalizing
the
operation
of
this
advisory
committee
in
a
way
which
may
lead
the
committee
itself
to
feel
it
can't
function
under
that
regime,
or
will,
i
think,
dramatically
affect
the
relationship.
third,
the
committee
is,
under
the
statute,
made
subject
to
the
mandatory
and
continuing
oversight
of
both
the
general
services
administration
and
the
committees
of
the
senate
and
the
house
that
supposedly
have
jurisdiction
in
this
area,
which
presumably
would
be
the
judiciary
committees
of
each
house.
finally,
the
records,
and
these
include
the
internal
records
of
the
committee,
together
with
all
meetings
of
the
committee,
would
be
subject
to
the
open
access
provisions
of
the
act.
and
the
decision
on
whether
or
not
to
apply
the
exemptions
that
are
available,
would
not
be
up
to
the
committee,
but
would
be
up
to
the
federal
officers
who
are
in
charge
of
administering
that
part
of
the
statute.
unfortunately,
we
don't
feel
that
we
can
readily
and
completely
accept
the
offer
of
public
citizen,
that
all
of
the
matters
that
need
to
be
protected
from
the
viewpoint
of
the
executive
and
the
committee
would,
in
fact,
be
protected
by
those
exemptions.
we
know
that
the
washington
legal
foundation
itself
takes
a
different
view
on
some
of
these.
we
have
no
doubt
that
they
would
be
involved
in
litigation
if
the
act
were
held
subject
to
this
committee.
there
are
a
number
of
other
related
provisions
which
are
not
so
important.
apparently
the
relationship
would
have
to
terminate
immediately,
could
only
be
renewed
on
the
filing
of
a
charter
and
other
matters.
there
would
be
requirements
of
reporting
and
so
on.
so
that
the
overall
effect
would
be
one
of
really
destroying
the
private
character
of
this
organization
as
a
consultant,
with
respect
to
the
relationship
to
the
executive
and
to
the
president.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
the
first
amendment...
let
me
say
two
things
about
the
first
amendment
point
on
which
we've
taken
a
very
limited
position
in
our
brief.
first,
the
first
amendment
is
being
raised
for
the
first
time
in
this
whole
litigation
in
this
court.
the
first
amendment
question
may
raise
issues
of
statutory
construction
and
the
reach
of
the
statute
that
we
do
not
believe
have
to
be
resolved
to
resolve
the
questions
of
application
and
constitutionality
that
we
are
raising.
it
is
our
position
that,
to
the
extent
and
advisory
committee
functions
in
some
sort
of
preferred
capacity,
receiving
confidential
information
that
is
not
generally
available,
that
there
is
no
sustainable
first
amendment
claim
that
that
committee
can
make.
but,
in
any
event,
we
think
that
because
the
first
amendment
issue
may
raise
its
own
difficult
issues
of
statutory
construction,
that
that
issue
should
be
remanded
to
the
lower
courts
if
it's--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--your
honor,
we
have
not
raised
the
first
amendment
issue
in
our
brief.
we
commented
on
it
in
a
footnote
only
because
the
american
bar
association
raised
it
as
appellee.
we
do
not
believe
that
that
issue
should
be
reached
in
this
case.
we
believe
that
if
the
court
thinks
it's
not
too
late
to
consider
the
aba's
raising
of
the
brief,
then
it
would
be
appropriate
to
remand
it.
we
have
not
raised
the
issue
here.
we
have
only
tried
to
respond
in
a
footnote
to
the
aba's
effort
to
raise
it.
it's
against
this
background,
then,
that
we
think
the
question...
the
very
difficult
question
of
statutory
construction
must
be
considered.
i
think
at
the
outset,
with
the
question...
the
question
of
statutory
construction,
we
should
emphasize,
is
not
really
a
question
of
plain
meeting
or
not
plain
meeting.
the
appellants
come
here
clad
in
the
armor
of
plain
meeting,
or
at
least
purport
to,
but
the
fact
is
that
this
statute
is
so
broadly
and
sweepingly
written
that
it
has
been
consistently
recognized
not
to
have
any
ascertainable
plain
meeting.
the
broadest
possible
reach
of
the
definition
of
an
advisory
committee
under
this
statute
could
apply
to
any
situation
in
which
the
executive
tries
to
obtain
the
help
of
two
or
more
people
if
one
of
those
people
is
not
a
federal
employee.
to
give
the
statute
that
kind
of
broad
reading
has
been
consistently
recognized
to
threaten
to
cripple
the
executive
process
of
consultation
and
to
raise
the
most
serious
issues
of
separation
of
powers.
the
result
is
that
from
the
very
beginning,
the
statute
has
not
been
given
the
broadest,
most
sweeping
construction
that
the
language
might
justify.
there
are
many
examples
of
that.
a
few
of
most
significant,
i
think,
for
our
purposes
include
some,
which
the
appellants
have
conceded
in
this
court.
for
example,
despite
the
sweeping
language
of
the
statute,
it
is
thought
to
to
apply
to
consultation
of
informal
or
ad
hoc
groups,
at
least
where
the
advice
sought
is
not
clearly
spelled
out
in
advance.
second,
it
is
thought,
under
the
regulations
of
the
gsa,
and
again,
appellants
appear
to
concede
this
point,
that
the
act
probably
does
not
apply
if
the
advisory
group
does
not
have
some
sort
of
preferred
position
in
the
hierarchy
of
those
groups
whose
advice
is
sought,
which
may,
indeed,
require
the
communication
of
some
confidential
information.
third,
the
act
has
been
held
not
to
apply
to
an
advisory
committee
that
has
operational
as
well
as
advisory
functions,
the
bicentennial
commission
being
an
example
of
that
in
a
case
prosecuted
and
lost
by
public
citizen
in
the
courts
below.
finally,
as
an
example,
the
act
has
been
held
not
to
apply
in
cases
in
which
the
advice
of
the
group
is
sought
from
the
individual
members
of
the
group
rather
than
on
some
consensus
basis
from
the
group
as
a
whole.
now
none
of
these
constructions,
all
of
which
we
believe
are
sincere,
good-faith
efforts
to
come
to
terms
with
a
very
sweeping
statute,
none
of
these
constructions
can
be
explained
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
very
sweeping
language.
they
can
be
explained,
we
believe,
only
on
the
basis
of
a
conscientious
and
intensive
effort
to
figure
out
what
it
was
congress
was
concerned
about,
what
it
was
that
they
were
trying
to
do.
and
that
is
the
effort
that
we
have
tried
to
undertake
in
our
brief
and
that
we
urge
this
court
to
undertake.
we
believe
that
if
you
do
make
that
examination
of
the
history,
background
and
concern
of
this
act,
you
discover
that
the
primary
concerns
of
congress
were
first,
with
the
waste
of
a
great
deal
of
federal
money
and
effort.
money
that,
at
the
time
the
act
was
enacted,
was
approaching
something
like
$100
million
a
year,
and
which,
even
under
the
statute
has
continued
to
mount
ever
since.
the
other
principal
concern,
we
believe,
was
essentially
with
the
undue
influence
that
advisory
committees
were
thought
to
have
on
the
implementation
of
regulatory
legislative
policy;
matters
that
are
clearly
of
continuing
legislative
concern
and
oversight.
indeed,
when
this
act
was
introduced
in
the
house,
both
the
chair
of
the
committee
and
the
minority
chair
spoke
of
their
concern
that
advisory
committees
were
usurping
the
proper
role
of
congress
with
respect
to
the
oversight
of
regulatory
and
legislative
policy.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
but
i
think
that
it
has
to
be
done
against
the
background
of
these
two
concerns.
as
the
act
was
drafted,
both
in
the
house
and
senate,
it
spoke
only
of
advisory
committees
established
by
the
executive
or
by
the
president.
indeed,
presidential
commissions,
advisory
commissions
came
into
the
process--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--no.
the
conference
committee
added
the
word
utilize
without
any
explanation.
and,
of
course,
it
is
sometimes
thought
that
conference
committees
are
not
supposed
to
enlarge
or
significantly
alter
the
effect
of
the
statute
as
it
has
come
from
both
branches.
so
one
possible
argument
is
that
the
word
utilize,
in
effect,
did
not
actually
change
the
scope
of
the
statute,
but
simply
was
designed
to
clarify
it.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
no,
sir.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
that's
right.
no,
we
think
the
word
utilize
has
had
an
effect,
we
simply
don't
think
that
its
proper
scope
can
be
determined
simply
looking
at
its
dictionary
meaning,
just
as
in
the
o'connor
case,
the
proper
scope
of
the
word
income
taxes
could
not
be
determined
by
looking
at
the
four
corners
of
the
treaty.
and
in
the
american
trucking
association
case,
the
proper
scope
of
the
word
employees
could
similarly
not
be
determined.
the
efforts
that
we've
discussed
before,
to
limit
the
scope
of
the
act,
do
not
turn
on
the
dictionary
meaning
of
the
word
utilize,
they
turn
on
a
concern
that
application
of
the
act,
giving
it
its
full
sweep,
could
effectively
cripple
the
operation
of
the
executive
and
raise
serious
separation
of
powers
problems.
those
issues,
it
seems
to
us,
are
intensified
when
we
are
talking
about
powers
like
the
nominating
power,
the
pardon
power,
the
veto
power;
powers
that
are--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--i
do
to
the
word
utilize...
or
we
do,
i
think
essentially
what
the
court
did
to
the
word
income
taxes
in
the
o'connor
case.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
the
court
said
that
the
exemption
from
all
income
taxes
under
the
treaty
did
not
include
federal
income
taxes
because
it
was
apparent
from
the
concerns
of
those
who
wrote
the
treaty
that
the
desire
was
to
exclude
people
from
income
taxes
levied
by
panama
and
not
by...
from
income
taxes
levied
by
the
united
states.
we
believe
that
it
is
equally
true
that
there
was
no
purpose
here
to
regulate
the
activities
of
the
committees...
those
committees
that
made
no
use
of
federal
funds,
and
that
were
in
no
way
involved
with
the
implementation
of
legislative
policy.
but,
rather,
were
involved
entirely,
and
at
their
own
expense,
with
advising
the
president
on
matters
of
his
exclusive
concern.
there
is
not
one
reference
in
this
very
elaborate
legislative
history
to
the
very
well
known
activities
of
this
committee
at
the
time,
or
indeed,
to
any
activities
of
the
president
that
fall
into
the
categories
that
we
are
discussing.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
we
do,
your
honor.
we
have
cited
the
history--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--we've
cited
cases
that
cite
it--
[laughter]
and
we
are
happy
to
rely
on
it.
the
case
is
very
much
like
the
o'connor
case,
like
the
american
trucking
association's
case.
there
are
many
cases
in
which
words
have
been
limited,
not
because
of
their
dictionary
meaning,
but
because
it...
it
appeared
so
evident
that
they
fell
so
far
beyond
the
scope
of
congressional
concern.
in
the
holy
trinity
case,
the...
the
problem
was
similar;
the
catholic
bishop
case,
the
problem
was
similar.
there
are
so
many
cases
in
which
this
rule
has
been
applied.
and
the
cases
we
believe
are
most
significant,
in
which
we
are
talking
about
serious
constitutional
questions
that
were
never
addressed
or
considered
by
congress.
in
those
cases,
we
believe
it
is
appropriate
to
apply
a
clear
statement
rule.
and,
any
version
of
that
rule,
i
believe,
would
lead
to
the
result
we
are
contending
for
here.
now,
it's
for
all
those
reasons
that
we
believe
the
constitutional
questions
that
we
are
raising
do
not
need
to
be
reached.
but
we
believe
it's
appropriate
to
discuss
them
both
because
the
court
may
reach
them,
and
because
we
believe
that
they
flesh
out,
lend
substance
to
the
arguments
of
statutory
construction
that
we're
making.
the
effect
of
the
act,
if
it
applies
in
this
case,
is,
we
believe,
severely
to
change
the
relationship
between
the
executive
and
bar
committee
with
respect
to
the
nominating
power.
now
the
nominating
power
is
a
very
special
power
under
the
constitution,
and
i
think
must
be
distinguished
from
the
appointment
process.
the
appointment
process
involves
both
the
exercise
of
the
presidential
nominating
power
and
the
exercise
of
the
senatorial
function
of
advice
and
consent.
but
the
nominating
power
itself
is
clearly
the
prerogative
of
the
executive,
and
it
is
thought
to
be
a
very
special
prerogative
of
the
executive
from
the
very
beginning.
hamilton,
jefferson,
washington,
and
others,
at
the
very
beginning,
and
their
successors
ever
since,
have
felt
that
this
process
must
be
exclusively
theirs,
and
that
they
must
be
able
to
consult
people
whom
they
wish
to
consult
on
an
entirely
confidential
basis--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--i
think
there
may
have
been
a
point
under
president
carter's
administration,
when
there
was
such
a
committee,
which
the
executive
at
that
time
may
have
chosen
to
subject
to
the
act.
i
don't
believe
there
was
any
litigation
over
it.
at
the
present
time
there
are
a
number
of
presidential
advisory
commissions
that
are
subject
to
the
act.
i
don't
believe
any
of
them
fit
into
the
category
that
we
are
talking
about
today.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
i
believe,
to
the
extent
we
have
looked
into
this
and
we
have
been
able...
we
have
checked,
for
example,
all
the
committees
cited
in
the
appellant's
brief,
everyone
of
the
committees
cited
uses
significant
federal
funds.
many
were
created
by
the
federal
government--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--i
know
of
no
effort
to
apply
the
act
to
any
communications
between
the
executive
and
the
republican
national
committee.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
it
might.
it
might,
depending
on
a
number--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--if
the
president,
for
example,
were
to
consult
with
the
afl-cio
and
its
executive
council,
with
respect
to
the
appointment
of
the
secretary
of
labor,
if
the
act
were
held
applicable
to
the
aba
committee,
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
see
how
it
could
not
be
held
applicable
there.
and
it
seems
to
me,
similar
constitutional
questions
would
arise.
the
nominating
power,
we
believe,
is
very
special
because
of
the
emphasis
of
the
framers
on
the
president's
sole
responsibility
for
the
nomination,
and
the
essential
aspect
that,
in
order
to
exercise
that
responsibility,
he
must
have
discretion
to
consult
the
people
he
chooses
to
consult
in
the
manner
he
chooses
to
exercise.
and
every
president
since
washington,
i
believe,
has
recognized
that
confidentiality
is
an
essential
part
of
that
process,
because
it
is
only
through
that
kind
of
confidentiality
that
he
can
have
the
kind
of
candor--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--congress'
power
to
regulate
the
nominating
process,
your
honor,
we
believe
is
extremely
limited.
with
respect
to
its
ability
to
regulate
the
president's
discretion
in
seeking
advice,
it
is
our
position
that
congress
has
no
power
of
any
kind.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
i
think
perhaps
the
most
relevant
is
in
the
area
of
qualifications
for
office.
that
is,
there
are
a
number
of
situations
where
congress
has
not
only
defined
a
particular
or
federal
office,
but,
as
part
of
that
process,
has
spelled
out
the
qualifications
for
that
office.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
i
believe
that,
i'm
not
certain,
but
i
believe
that
district
judges
have
to
be
residents
of
the
state
in
which
they're
appointed.
there
is,
i
think
a
residence
requirement
for
judges.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
uh-huh,
by
statute.
now
we
don't
deny
that
reasonable
qualifications
on
eligibility
for
office
are
within
the
authority
of
congress
to
define
those
offices,
but
we
do
believe
that
that
authority
is
not
subject
simply
to
a
rationality
test,
because
it
does
impose
a
very
severe
problem
of
invading
the
president's
authority
to
nominate.
if,
for
example,
there
were
a
statute
that
said
that
members
of
this
court
could
only
be
nominated
from
among
those
who
were
already
federal
judges,
that
could
perhaps
be
rationally
related
to
the
job.
but
we
believe
it
would
be
too
great
an
interference
with
the
president's
authority
to
nominate.
so
that
a
very
close
look,
we
believe,
must
be
taken,
and
questions
of
that
sort.
but
the
overlap
between--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--well,
in
the
area
of
qualifications,
we
think
that
inevitably
the
test
is
one
of
balance.
in
the
area
of
the
president's
ability
to
seek
advice
from
the
people
he
chooses
and
in
the
manner
he
chooses,
we
submit
the
test
is
not
one
of
balance.
that
this
is
a
matter
over
which
congress
has
no
control;
that
congress'
role
in
the
appointments
process,
with
respect
to
advice
and
consultation,
is
limited
to
the
advice
and
consent
role
of
the
senate
after
the
nomination
has
been
made.
that
the
interference
that
this
act
would
impose
on
the
very
important
discretion
of
the
president
to
seek
the
advice
of
those
he
chooses
and
in
the
manner
he
chooses,
cannot
be
sustained
with
the
authority
of
the
president
under
article
ii.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
thank
you.
