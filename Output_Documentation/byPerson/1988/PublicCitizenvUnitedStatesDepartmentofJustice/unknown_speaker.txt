unknown
speaker
how
do
you
know
that?
unknown
speaker
where
did
you...
where
did
you
get
the
notion,
though,
that...
that
it
is
exclusive?
you
say,
perhaps,
exclusive
source
of
information.
unknown
speaker
did
the
department
of
justice
ever
concede
that?
unknown
speaker
that's
a...
that's
a...
that's
a
far
cry
from
saying
it's
the
only
source
of
information.
just
because
that's
the
only
committee
they
employ.
there's
a
lot
of
other
ways
of
getting
information
besides
calling
on
the
committee.
unknown
speaker
of
course
they
do...
of
course.
of
course,
of
course.
but
you
see,
certainly,
you
shouldn't
say
that...
suggest
that
it's
the
exclusive
source
of
information
about
candidates.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
what
you
said.
unknown
speaker
how
long
has
that
been--
--has
that
always
been
in
effect?
unknown
speaker
you
know,
we've
all
been...
we've
all
been
through
this
wringer.
unknown
speaker
well,
some
of
us
have
been
on
the
court
of
appeals
also.
unknown
speaker
and
i
never
made
out
such
a
form.
and
it's
not
been
true
since
1952,
i
can
assure
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
how...
how
long
a
practice
are
we
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
was
done
when
i
was
appointed.
i
filled
out
a
form,
both
in
1971
and
1986,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
well,
if...
but
it
may
be
just
a
matter
of
the
written
form
having
been
introduced
at
a
particular
point,
and
the
members
of
this
court
obviously
came
to...
came
to
the
bench
at
different
times.
unknown
speaker
you...
you
speak
in
extremes.
now
you
say,
almost
invariably.
certainly
there
are
cases
where
persons
who
have
been
indicated
as
unqualified
have
been
confirmed.
unknown
speaker
well,
now
you're
saying
the
word
most;
before
you
said
almost
invariably.
i'm
just
a
little
concerned
about
your
use
of
extreme
language.
unknown
speaker
i'm
sorry.
where
did
you
read
from
on
page
60?
unknown
speaker
but
which
paragraph?
unknown
speaker
well...
go
ahead,
please.
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
well
they...
they
get
information
from
the
committee,
but
they
don't
particularly
rely
on
any
recommendation
of
the
committee
as
to
who
to
send
over
to
the
president.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
mean...
if
the
aba
says
they're
unqualified,
they
won't
be
sending
that
name
over.
but
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
are...
who
are
passed
on
as
qualified.
and
the
department
makes
up
its
own
mind
who
to
send
to
the
president.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
of
course.
well,
then,
you
shouldn't
say
that
they
rely
on
that
heavily,
as
to
whose...
what
name
to
send
to
the
president.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kamenar,
do
you
suppose
that
a
use
by
a
democratic
president
of
the
advice
of
the
democratic
national
committee
in
making
various
executive
branch
appointments
or
the
use
by
a
republican
president
of
the
republican
national
committee
for
getting
names
and
making
appointments,
is
also
covered
by
faca?
unknown
speaker
on
constitutional
grounds...
you...
you...
you...
you--
unknown
speaker
--but
what
i...
i
don't
understand
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor.
what
about
her
hypothetical?
why...
why
isn't
that
covered?
unknown
speaker
you
said
it
perhaps
a
special...
what
are
you
talking
about,
the
statute?
are
you
talking
about
a
constitutional
document?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
association
of
the
bar
of
the
city
of
new
york?
did
you
find
out
that
they
were
having
any
influence?
unknown
speaker
well,
did
you?
did
you
look
at
what
influence,
if
any,
that
the
association
of
the
bar
of
the
city
of
new
york
had?
unknown
speaker
my
point
is,
you
put
the
aba
out
there
all
by
itself,
and
there
are
several
others.
unknown
speaker
it
just...
it
just
happened
that
often
the
association
of
the
bar
of
the
city
of
new
york
interviews
and
passes
upon
people
before
the
justice
department
has
even
moved.
that
just
so
happens.
unknown
speaker
just
leaked
it
to
the
press.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
under
the
terms
of
the
statute,
what
difference
does
it
make
that
the
name
is
given
in
advance,
and
that
they
utilize
the
questionnaire
and
so
forth?
unknown
speaker
but
supposing
they
didn't
give
the
names
in
advance,
and
the
aba
did
it
on
its
own,
but
the
department,
nevertheless,
continued
to
utilize
their
recommendations
on
a
regular
basis?
unknown
speaker
but
not--
unknown
speaker
--why
would
it
be
different
under
the
terms
of
the
statute
if
they
regularly,
as
a
matter
of
practice,
gave
special
deference
to
the
aba
thinking
they--
unknown
speaker
--they
would
still
be
utilizing--
unknown
speaker
--what
if
the
president
announces
it
as
a
matter
of
policy,
i
think
these
people
give...
give
us
very
reliable
advice
and
i
want
you
to
rely
on
them
regularly.
that
would
still
be
the
same,
whether
they
got
questionnaires
or
confidential
information,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
when
you
say
use
them
exclusively,
but
you
just
earlier
agreed
they
do
not
use
them
exclusively,
they
have
lots
of
sources
of
information
about
candidates.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
my
hypothetical.
they
don't
have
any
secret...
they
don't
have
any
questionnaires
or
anything.
they
just
say,
as
a
matter
of
policy,
we
don't
think
we
want
to
confirm
any...
or
submit
any
name
to
the
senate
that
the
local
bar
association
doesn't
endorse,
or
doesn't
find
qualified.
wouldn't
the
local
bar
association,
then,
be
utilized
in
exactly
the
same
sense
that
these
people
are?
just
as...
justice
marshall's
question,
really,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
kamenar.
we'll
recess
for
lunch.
mr.
glitzenstein?
unknown
speaker
how
does
it...
how
does
it
happen
that
gsa,
rather
than
some
other
agency,
promulgated
the
regulations
here?
unknown
speaker
now
the
gsa
maintains
lists
of
committees
that
are
covered,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
so
it
doesn't
include
in
the
list
any
committees
that
are
not
chartered?
unknown
speaker
and
the
aba
committee
has,
of
course,
never
been
on
the
list?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
tell
us
how
many
of
those
committees
receive
any
kind
of
government
financing
for
their
activities?
unknown
speaker
does
the
committee
have
to
be
utilized
over
a
period
of
time
before
it's
utilized
within
the
statutory
definition?
that
is
to
say,
suppose
the
attorney
general
said,
the
next
three
judges
i
am
going
to
appoint
in
this
state
i
want
to
consult...
then
fill
in
the
blank:
american
trial
lawyers-association,
naacp.
unknown
speaker
and...
and
i
want
to
use
them
in
the
same
way
i
use
the
aba.
unknown
speaker
so
there...
so
there
is
a
time
component?
and
if
you
use
the
american
trial
lawyers
or
the
naacp
for
three
appointments,
then
you're
within
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
so
if
that...
so,
then
it's
true
even
if
only
there...
there
is
consultation
with
only...
with
respect
only
to
one
appointment?
unknown
speaker
but
the
statement
says
it
couldn't
function
without
it.
it
functioned
many
years
without
it,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
didn't
it?
yes
or
no,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
it
functioned?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that's
all
in
that
opinion
letter,
but
what
is
the
statutory
foundation
for
the...
this
emphasis
on
confidential
information?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
why
it's
even...
even
a
single
criteria.
i
mean,
i...
it
may
make
a
difference
in
the
way
it
functions,
but
just
reading
the
statute,
i
don't
see
why
it
makes
a
bit
of
difference
whether
the
aba
committee
has
confidential
information
or
not,
as
long
as
they
meet
and
discuss
the
qualifications
of
the
candidate,
come
up
with
a...
a
not-qualified
or
qualified
recommendation.
unknown
speaker
but
you
want
us
to
look
at
all
advisory
committees
that
have
been
established,
and
then
somehow
draw
those
common
characteristics
and
apply
them
to
private
entities.
i
haven't
reviewed
the
statute,
but
i
would
imagine
every
private...
every
advisory
committee
established
by
the
congress
is
different.
and
that
has
simply
no
footing
in
this
statute.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
glitzenstein.
mr.
shapiro?
unknown
speaker
mr.
shapiro,
does...
if
we
reach
the
constitutional
issue,
does
that
require
us
to
know
a
little
more
about
how
the
operation
of
this
law
would
affect
the
process?
i'm
a
little
concerned
that
we're
deciding
the
question,
potentially,
with
very
little
understanding
of
how,
in
fact,
it
would
impact
on
the
operation
of
the
committee,
or
the
presidents,
or
the
department
of
justice's
use
of
the
committee.
unknown
speaker
it's
a
little
like
a
facial
challenge
when
we...
we
don't
know
how
it
would
play
out.
there
was
something
in
the
material
circulated
to
us
from
the
early
assessment
of
it
by
the
department
of
justice
to
the
effect
that,
well,
we
think
the
plain
language
makes
it
apply
to
the
aba
committee,
but
we
don't
think
it'll
have
any
substantial
effect.
now
that's
the
very
inquiry
we
have
been
making
in
separation
of
powers
cases
around
here.
unknown
speaker
that
officer
would
be
appointed
by
the
justice
department,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
so
it
would
be
somebody
out
of
the
attorney
general's
office?
unknown
speaker
from
the
standpoint
of
a
facial
or
free
speech
analysis,
i
think
that
raises
serious
concerns,
but
it's
not
clear
to
me
that
we
have
enough
information
to
say
that
it
raises
a
real
systemic
problem
with
reference
to
separation
of
powers.
unknown
speaker
if...
if
you
can
say
all
of
that
on
this
record,
i'm
not
sure
why
you
said
in
your
brief
in
a
footnote
that
you
don't
need
to
address
the
first
amendment.
i
understand
that
they
are
alternative
points,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
these
sound...
each
of
these,
like
a
first
amendment
analysis,
and
if
you
don't
need
a
trial
or
further
proceedings
for
the
separation
of
powers
point,
i
don't
see
why
you'd
need
it
for
the
first
amendment
either.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
shapiro,
is
it
the
government's
position
that
is
has
really
two
rounds
of
litigation,
that
it
can
take
one
position
in
the
lower
courts
the
first
time,
and
then
raise
an
issue
in
the
supreme
court
and
say,
we
didn't
raise
it
below,
but
we
think
it's
important,
so
send
it
back
for
another
round?
unknown
speaker
mr.
shapiro,
i
take
it
that
sooner
or
later
you
are
going
to
get
down
to
the
actual
language
of
the
act
and
see
how
you
avoid
that?
unknown
speaker
but
that
isn't
the
way
it
was
passed?
unknown
speaker
well,
you're...
you're
saying
we
just
should
ignore
the
word
utilize?
unknown
speaker
because...
there
will
be
a
lot
of
committees,
you
would
say,
that
are
utilized
that
are
covered
by
the
act,
i
suppose?
unknown
speaker
so
what
do
you
do
to
the
word
utilize?
what
do
you--
unknown
speaker
--well,
what
was
that?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
place
much
confidence
in
the
case
of
church
of
the
holy
trinity?
unknown
speaker
you
certainly
don't
place
much
confidence...
or
emphasis
on
it
in
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
mr.
shapiro,
has
this
act
been
applied
to
some
advisory
committee
on
ambassadorial
appointments
by
the
president?
unknown
speaker
none
of
them
are
private
agencies?
unknown
speaker
how
about
things
like
the
republican
national
committee?
unknown
speaker
but,
theoretically,
if
it
applies
here
to
the
aba
committee,
it
would
apply
to
that?
unknown
speaker
or
the
afl-cio
committees
in
advising
the
president
or
the
department
of
labor?
unknown
speaker
so...
so
would
you
say
that
congress
could
not
enact
any
direct
regulation
of
the
nominating
process?
unknown
speaker
are
there
any
instances
where
congress
does
attempt
to
regulate
the
nominating
process,
other
than
the
one
before
us?
unknown
speaker
that's
not
true
with
respect
to
judges,
is
it,
or
is
it?
unknown
speaker
by
statute?
unknown
speaker
so
what's
the
test
you
propose?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
shapiro.
mr.
kamenar,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
