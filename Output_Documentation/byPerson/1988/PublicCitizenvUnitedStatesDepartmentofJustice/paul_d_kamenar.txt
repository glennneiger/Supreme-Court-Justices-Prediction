mr.
paul
d.
kamenar
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
the
court
in
this
case
is
whether
american
bar
association
standing
committee
on
the
federal
judiciary
constitutes
an
advisory
committee
under
the
federal
advisory
committee
act
in
the
way
it
is
utilized
by
the
department
of
justice
in
obtaining
the
aba's
advice
and
recommendations
on
the
qualification
of
federal
judicial
candidates.
and
if
so,
whether
applying
that
statute
to
the
aba
committee
would
violate
the
president's
power
under
article
ii
to
nominate
federal
judges,
and
thereby
violate
the
separation
of
powers.
the
lower
court
ruled,
correctly
in
our
view,
that
the
aba
committee
is
indeed
an
advisory
committee
under
the
statute,
but
how
that
applying
that
statute
to
the
aba
committee
would
violate
the
president's
power
under
article
ii.
it's
our
position
that
the
district
court
incorrectly
struck
down
an
entire
statute
of
congress
without
giving
the
government
an
opportunity
to
apply
any
of
its
various
provisions.
i
would
like
to
begin
my
argument
by
briefly
describing
for
the
court
how
the
aba
committee
operates,
and
describing
its
institutional
relationship
with
the
department
of
justice.
since
1952
the
department
of
justice
has
consistently
utilized
the
aba
committee
as
a
preferred,
if
not
exclusive,
source
of
advice
on
the
qualifications
of
federal
judicial
candidates
to
the
courts
of
appeal
and
the
district
courts.
mr.
paul
d.
kamenar
your
honor,
we
know
that
from
information
provided
by
the
aba
and
the
department
of
justice.
mr.
paul
d.
kamenar
your
honor,
i
believe
if
we
look
at
the--
mr.
paul
d.
kamenar
--i
think,
your
honor,
in
terms
of
the
qualifications
of
individuals
nominees,
the
department
of
justice
has
stated
that...
in
my
statement
of
material
facts,
i'm
looking
at
joint
appendix
on
page
56.
we
stated,
"the
department
of
justice
does
not
ask
any
outside
committees,
other
than
the
aba
committee,
for
advice
on
the
suitability
and
qualifications
of
possible
nominees
for
federal
judgeships."
mr.
paul
d.
kamenar
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
department
of
justice
did
admit
that
the
aba
committee
is
relied
upon
in
terms
of
providing
it
with
advice
on
the
qualifications
of
the
nominees.
mr.
paul
d.
kamenar
if
i
did,
your
honor,
i
misspoke,
and
i
apologize.
mr.
paul
d.
kamenar
i
apologize
to
the
court
for
misspeaking
on
that.
once
a
candidate
has
been
identified
by
the
department
of
justice
as
a
serious
candidate,
that
person
is
required
to
fill
out
a
personal
data
questionnaire,
which
is
designed
by
the
aba
committee.
that
questionnaire
is
then
given
to
the
aba
circuit
member,
as
well
as
the
aba
committee
chairman.
no
other
outside
group
gets
that
information.
mr.
paul
d.
kamenar
as
far
as
we
can
tell,
your
honor,
that's
what
the
record
shows;
that
that
personal
data
questionnaire--
mr.
paul
d.
kamenar
--well,
i'm
sure,
your
honors,
you
have,
although
it
has
been
episodic
with
respect
to
some
supreme
court
nominees.
it's
consistent
with
respect
to
courts
of
appeals
and
district
court
nominees,
and
it's
episodic
with
respect
to--
mr.
paul
d.
kamenar
--that's
right,
your
honor,
you
have--
mr.
paul
d.
kamenar
--well,
your
honor,
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that
that
form
has
been
filled
out
since
1952,
i'm
talking
about
what
the
current
practice
is
for
the
last...
this
last...
the
last
several
administrations,
and
what
was--
mr.
paul
d.
kamenar
--your
honor,
i
do
not
know
that,
unfortunately.
i
think
the
department
of
justice
could
best
ask
that.
again,
this
committee
operates
in
secret,
and
that's
what's
part
of
the
problem
here.
mr.
paul
d.
kamenar
well,
again,
your
honor,
this
probably
illustrates
what
kind
of
confusion
we
have
here.
perhaps
if
we
applied
this
federal
advisory
committee
act,
we
can
find
out
exactly
how
this
committee
is
operating,
and
see
whether
they
apply
it
sometimes,
and
they
don't
apply
it
in
others.
and
that
precisely
gets
to
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
here.
mr.
paul
d.
kamenar
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
aba
committee
member
then
interviews
this
candidate,
they
interview
judges
and
practitioners
in
the
area
to
get
their
views
on
the
qualifications
of
the
potential
nominee.
when
this
investigation
is
completed
by
the
circuit
member,
he
then,
or
she
then
makes
an
initial
rating
of
that
candidate;
whether
he
is
extremely
well
qualified,
well
qualified,
qualified,
or
not
qualified.
and
the
key
part
of
this
investigation
is
the
following:
if
they
decide
that
this
person
is
not
qualified
to
be
a
federal
judge,
that
is...
is...
is...
that
information
is
advised...
given
to
the
department
of
justice,
and
almost
invariably,
the
not-qualified
rating
results
in
the
department
of
justice
removing
that
individual
from
further
consideration
to
be
a
judge.
mr.
paul
d.
kamenar
that
is
the
exception,
not
the
rule,
your
honor.
i
direct
the
court
to
page
60
of
the
joint
appendix,
where
the
defendant,
the
department
of
justice,
states,
"the
defendant
admits
that
most
candidates
for
nomination,
which
have
not
received
a
not-qualified
rating
by
the
aba
committee
have
not
been
recommended
by
the
attorney
general
for
nomination
to
the
president."
mr.
paul
d.
kamenar
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
d.
kamenar
page
60
of
the
joint
appendix,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
d.
kamenar
it's
paragraph
6,
about
middle
of
the
way
down.
nevertheless,
your
honor,
this
is
important
to
show
that
the...
the
aba
committee
is
heavily
relied
upon
by
the
department
of
justice
in
making
its
decisions
as
to
who
to
recommend
to
the
president
to
be
a
federal
judge.
let
me
just
sum
up
in
this
way,
in
terms
of
the
facts.
the
aba--
mr.
paul
d.
kamenar
--the--
mr.
paul
d.
kamenar
--i
disagree
with
your
honor
on
that,
they
do
rely
on
that
information--
mr.
paul
d.
kamenar
--if
it's
qualified
or
better,
the
department
does
make
up
its
own
mind.
it
could
very
well
be,
even
if
they
did
rate
a
person
as
qualified,
the
department
would
still
not
nominate
that
person
to
the--
mr.
paul
d.
kamenar
--i
don't
mean
to
say
that
they
rely
on
it
exclusively;
they
do
rely
on
it
in
the
way
that
advisory
committees
are
usually
relied
upon
for
their
advice.
if
there's
any
doubt
about...
i
mean,
both
the
department
of
justice
and
the
aba
have
even
acknowledged
that
there
is
a
semi-official
or
quasi-official
relationship
established
here
between
the
department
of
justice
and
the
aba.
and
if
there's
any
doubt
about
whether
or
not
this
aba
committee
is
a...
an
advisory
committee
and
utilized
as
such,
we
think
the
department
of
justice
answered
it
best
itself
back
in
1973
and
1974,
when
they
concluded
that,
"under
any
reasonable
construction
of
utilization,
the
aba
committee
is
utilized
by
the
department."
and
again,
"an
honest
reading
of
the
statute
points
in
the
direction
of
inclusion."
mr.
paul
d.
kamenar
your
honor
raises
a
good
question
there,
and
that
brings
to...
the
answer
to
that
brings
into
question
the...
the
decision
of
this
court
recently,
in
the
university
of
san
francisco
democratic
party.
in
other
words,
there
may
be
a
special
relationship
that
the
president...
the
incoming
president
enjoys
with
his
own
party,
such
that
it
would
be
excluded
from...
be
considered
an
advisory
committee
in
that
respect.
although
i
must
admit
that,
on
the
face
of
the
statute--
mr.
paul
d.
kamenar
--on...
on
constitutional
grounds,
perhaps.
but
we
are
clearly
far
apart
in
this
case
where
they're
relying
on
a
private,
special
group,
such
as
the
american
bar
association.
mr.
paul
d.
kamenar
it
would
be...
first
of
all
we
have
to
determine--
mr.
paul
d.
kamenar
--your
honor,
we
would
first
have
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
a
committee
within
the
rnc
or
dnc
that
advises
the
president
on
these
particular
nominees.
that's
the
first
statutory
hurdle
we
have
to
get
over.
if,
in
fact,
it
is,
and
there...
it's
a
preferred
source
of
advice,
then
the
statute
would
seem
to
indicate
that
if
the
president
relies...
that
a
preferred
source
of
advice
on
that
committee,
it
would
be
an
advisory
committee.
then
we
would
have
to
reach,
at
that
point,
in
a
constitutional
issue,
if,
in
fact,
the
government...
if
it
was
going...
if
it
was
going
to
be
determined
that
that
dnc
or
rnc
committee
must
come
under
the
strictures
of
the
act.
but
that...
we
don't
have
to
reach
that
kind
of
a
question
in
this
case
because,
what
we
are
talking
about
is
what
congress
intended
to
do
in
terms
of
trying
to
have
some
public
disclosure
as
to
how
private
interest
groups
are
working
in
the
decision-making
process.
i
think
the
american
people
realize
that
the
president
is
relying
on
his
own
party
for
advice,
in
terms
of
how
to
make
decisions,
and
perhaps
the
public
interest
is
not
necessarily
as
well
served,
need
to
be
served,
as
opposed
to
the
president
or
the
executive
branch
relying
on
a
wholly
private
trade
group,
labor
group,
or
industry
group,
to
tell
it
how
to
do
its
business.
mr.
paul
d.
kamenar
in
terms
of
giving
their
advice
to
the
department
of
justice,
we
think
that
the...
the
criteria
that
we've
developed,
with
respect
to
the
preferred
source
of
advice
of
this
committee,
how
it
is
utilized
by
the
department
of
justice,
would
distinguish
the
aba
from
all
the
hypotheticals,
including
your
honor's
hypothetical,
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
they
would
come
under
the
advisory
committee
act
or
not.
we
think
that...
if
you
look
at
the
gsa
regulations,
they
look
at
whether
they
use
a
common
sense
approach--
mr.
paul
d.
kamenar
--we
didn't
investigate
the
bar
association
of
new
york,
but
it's
our--
mr.
paul
d.
kamenar
--your
honor,
the
big
distinction
between
the
aba
and
the
bar
association
of
new
york
is
that
the
aba
gets
inside
information.
the
bar
association
of
new
york
does
not
get
the
personal
data
questionnaire,
does
not
get
the
first
crack,
if
you
will,
at
whether
or
not
that
judge
is
going
to
be
nominated...
if
that
person
if
going
to
be
nominated
as
a
federal
judge.
and
that
distinguishes,
we
believe,
all
the
hypotheticals
that
the
appellees
and
the
amici
try
to
scare
this
court
into
thinking
that
they
would
be--
mr.
paul
d.
kamenar
--but,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
the
justice
department
gives
them
the
name
ahead
of
time,
and
relies
on
their
advice
before
the
department
of
justice
moves
on
that
regard.
mr.
paul
d.
kamenar
well,
then...
they
may
be...
it
depends
upon
how
fast
the
ab...
the
bar
association
of
new
york
may
come
under
the
statute,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
facts...
haven't
been
developed
in
that
particular
case
as
it
has
in
this
case,
where
the
department
of
justice
has
conceded
in
their
earlier
memorandum
that
the
aba
is
utilized
as
an
advisory
committee
under
the
statute.
mr.
paul
d.
kamenar
your
honor,
i
think
the
fact
that
their
names
are
given
in
advance,
and
the
questionnaire,
and
so
forth,
basically
underscores
the
institutional
and
advisory
relationship
that
they
enjoy
with
the
department
of
justice.
mr.
paul
d.
kamenar
that
may
be
a
different
situation
if,
in
fact--
mr.
paul
d.
kamenar
--the
department
of
justice
announced
that
this
is
the
person
we're
considering
to
be
a
federal
judge,
and
anybody
who
wants
to
comment
on
this
person's
qualifications,
feel
free
to
do
so
and
send
it
to
the
department
of
justice.
that
would
be
a
different
situation.
mr.
paul
d.
kamenar
well,
your
honor--
mr.
paul
d.
kamenar
--if
you
look
at
the
gsa
implementing...
implementing
regulations,
it
has
to
show
whether
it's
a
preferred
source
of
advice.
if
it
does
develop
that
they
are
invariably
relying
upon
the
department
of
justice...
i
mean,
the--
mr.
paul
d.
kamenar
--that...
that
would
probably...
if
they...
if
they
consistently
relied
on
the
aba,
that
would
probably
come
under
the
terms
of
the...
of
the
regulations.
however,
we
think
that
it...
it...
by
not
having
that
information
public,
by
using
them
exclusively,
that
highlights
the
importance
that
the
aba--
mr.
paul
d.
kamenar
--yes,
your
honor.
they
use
them
primarily
as
a
preferred
source
for
the--
mr.
paul
d.
kamenar
--yes.
i
think
at...
at
a
certain
point
we
would
see...
see
that
that
kind
of
relationship
would
probably
come
under
the
terms
of
the
statute,
but
i
think
that
the
justice
department
should
make
the
first
opportunity
as
to
whether
or
not
this
statute
applies
in
that
kind
of
a
situation.
and
they
haven't.
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
paul
d.
kamenar
just
briefly,
your
honor,
to
rebut
some
of
the
points
being
made
here
by
opposing
counsel.
they're
worried
about
interfering
with
the
powers
of
the
president,
in
crippling
the
presidency
in
this
particular
situation.
they
have
yet
to
talk
about
how
filing
a
simple
charter
would
somehow
bring
the
presidency
to
a
grinding
halt,
to
let
the
public
know
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
aba
committee
in
terms
of
evaluating
candidates.
they
talk
about
having
to
have
people
attend
these
meetings,
yet
the
attorney
general,
william
saxby
himself,
stated
that
applying
this
law
should,
"have
little
practical
effect
upon
the
aba
committee."
precisely
because
they
have
very
few
meetings
in
which
they
conduct
their
business.
so
it
would
not
be
as
intrusive
as
they
would
say.
and
it
seems
that
the
government
is
worried
about
somehow
federalizing
this
particular
aba
committee,
but
i
would
not
that
even
the
aba
themselves
think
of
themselves
as
a
quasi-official
or
government
official.
during
justice
kennedy's
hearings,
senator
grassley
asked
judge
tyler,
who
is
chairman
of
the
aba
committee,
"i'm
trying
to
have
a
public
dialogue
with
you
based
on
the
quasi-public
function
that
you
serve."
"maybe
you
don't
think
that
you
serve
that
kind
of
function."
mr.
tyler:
"i
agree,
we
do".
and
again,
that
was
reiterated
during
the
hearings
for
judge
bork.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
justice...
justice
kennedy
is
correct,
that
that's
more
of
a
first
amendment
argument,
rather
than
whether
or
not
this
committee
comes
under
the
statute.
with
respect
to
the
statutory
interpretation
argument,
i
think
there
is
argument
is
pretty
absurd,
because
if
they're
talking
about
whether
congress
intended
to
regulate
the
presidential
advisory
committees,
they
expressly
provided
in
the
statute
a
provision
for
presidential
advisory
committees.
i
don't
see
how
congress
could
get
any
clearer
that
that's
what
they
intended
to
do.
and
certainly
congress
knows
that
the
president
exercises
exclusive
powers
and
exercises
shared
or
concurrent
powers.
and
they
did
give
exemptions
to
the
president
for
advisory
committees
for
the
cia.
and
i
don't
think
we
should
carve
out
a
special
exemption
for
the
aba
in
this
statute.
thank
you,
your
honor.
