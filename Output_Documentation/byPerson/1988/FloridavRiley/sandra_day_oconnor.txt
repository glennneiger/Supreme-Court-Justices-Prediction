well,
mr.
thomson,
do
you
think
that
for
purposes
of
the
fourth
amendment,
at
least,
that
it
should
necessarily
mirror
federal
aviation
authority
regulations?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
similarly,
a
policeman
could
just
get
a
tall
ladder,
i
suppose,
and
put
it
up
on
the
sidewalk
and
look
over
the
top
of
the
roof--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--or
into
the
patio.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
using
a
device
other
than
a
ladder,
justice
blackman
suggests.
you
think
that's
all
right,
but
not
a
ladder?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
not
a
normal
police
activity,
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and,
mr.
thomson,
barring
noise
or
dust,
or
that
sort
of
disturbance,
you
would
think
that
it's
perfectly
reasonable
for
a
helicopter,
police
helicopter,
to
hover
of
a...
let's
say,
a
southwestern
type
house
with
an
inner
courtyard
or
patio
that
isn't
roofed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
all
right?
