unknown
speaker
does
it
show
now
far
from
the
road?
unknown
speaker
did
the
affidavit
refer
to
the
photographs?
unknown
speaker
xxx--
unknown
speaker
mr.
thomson,
i
think--
unknown
speaker
--i
think
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
there
is
no
different
rule
for
police
officers
than
the
private
individual.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
really
mean
that,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
that
a
police
officer
can
go
anyplace
that
a
private
car
can
go,
including
the
basement
of
this
building?
you
don't
really
mean
that.
you
don't--
unknown
speaker
--need
that,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
know--
unknown
speaker
--the
open
field
doctrine
didn't
contemplate
this.
unknown
speaker
because
they
didn't
have
helicopters.
unknown
speaker
did
they?
unknown
speaker
the
case...
the
case
was...
that's
justice
holmes'
case.
unknown
speaker
what
year
was
it
that
helicopters
had
been
around
a
long
time?
unknown
speaker
mr.
thomson,
in
discussing
with
justice
kennedy
the
possibility
of
a
private
cause
of
action
for
violation
of
privacy
under
florida
law,
did
you
mean
to
say
that
on
these
facts
a
florida
court
would
have
awarded--
unknown
speaker
--damages
or--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
thomson,
just
to
get
things
into
perspective,
i
have
here
a
brochure
about
this
building
and
it
says
that
this
room
has
a
height
of
44
feet.
unknown
speaker
i
would
have
guessed
it
was
maybe
closer
to
50,
but
at
least
that
gives
us
some
indication
of
where
your
helicopter
was
flying.
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
question
that
this
was
within
the
curtilage,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
shorter
than
this
bench?
unknown
speaker
well,
don't
we--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
think
the
curtilage
issue
is
here?
unknown
speaker
you
think
that's
subsumed
in
your
one
question
you
raised?
unknown
speaker
well,
did
you
claim
it
wasn't
within
the
curtilage
in
the
florida
courts?
unknown
speaker
well,
did
you
object
to
that
finding
in
the
appellate
courts?
that
it
was
within
the
curtilage
or
not?
unknown
speaker
so
your
argument
really
was
that
even
if
it
was
within
the
curtilage,
it's
still
reasonable?
unknown
speaker
and
you
didn't...
at
least
you
didn't
split
off
the
curtilage
issue
here.
unknown
speaker
so,
we
should...
do
you
think
we
should
judge
this
case
on
the
basis
that
the
greenhouse
was
within
the
curtilage?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
it
is,
but
what
do
you
think?
how
do
you
think
we
should
judge
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
that's
open
to
us
here?
unknown
speaker
perhaps
it
is.
maybe
that's
part
of
the
reasonableness
inquiry.
i
don't--
unknown
speaker
do
we
ever
even
get
into
this
kind
of
an
inquiry
if
it
is
conceded...
unless
we
have
to
determine
curtilage?
i
mean,
i'm
not
aware
of
any
cases
that
say,
yes,
this
was
within
the
curtilage
but
there
was
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
isn't
that
question
automatically
answered
if
we
accept
that
it
was
within
the
curtilage?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
salton,
suppose
that
what
had
happened
here
is
that
the
owner
of
the
home
had
simply
left
the
curtains
slightly
ajar
looking
into
the
home.
now,
a
police
officer
going
by
on
the
sidewalk
or
road
can
lock
in
through
that
window.
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
and
that's
perfectly
reasonable
even
though
it's
within
the
curtilage.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
curtains
are
left
open
and
the
policeman
is
there
on
the
sidewalk,
he
doesn't
have
to
turn
his
eyes
aside,
he
can
look
in
the
window
and
what
he
sees
he
can
use
to
get
a
warrant.
unknown
speaker
now,
is
the
flying
over
the
roof
where
they've
left
two
panels
off
similar
to
that?
is
it
like
looking
into
a
window
where
the
curtains
have
been
left
ajar?
unknown
speaker
and
why
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
air
space
above...
maybe
that's
like
a
public
thoroughfare
for
use
by
aircraft.
unknown
speaker
well,
400
feet
for
a
helicopter
is
a
lawful
use
apparently.
you
concede
that
the
helicopter
was
lawfully
at
400
feet,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
but
you
made
no
allegation
that
at
400
feet
it
was
a
hazard
to
anybody?
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
ten
times
the
height
of
this
room,
approximately.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
today's
world
do
we
have
to
define
what's
a
public
thoroughfare
in
the
air?
is
that
what
we
have
to
do?
unknown
speaker
well,
most
of
us
are
accustomed
to
helicopters
flying
overhead
rather
frequently
these
days,
aren't
we?
unknown
speaker
mr.
salton,
is
400
feet
above,
right
straight
up
here,
public
property?
unknown
speaker
is
it
public?
unknown
speaker
can
a
helicopter
fly
through
it?
unknown
speaker
may
fly
through
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
could
it
take
a
picture
from
it?
unknown
speaker
could
that
person
taking
the
picture
be
a
policeman?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you,
on
this
question
of
the
public
use
of
this
particular
air
space,
who
flies
helicopters?
i
know
police
departments
have
them,
the
military
has
them,
weather
has
them.
do
the...
does
the
private
citizen
normally
fly
around
in
a
helicopter?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
tells
us
how
many
helicopter
are
operated
by
private
citizens
for
their
own
personal
use?
unknown
speaker
mr.
salton,
suppose
i
have
a
house
that's
way
out
in
the
country.
it's
on
a
road
out
it's
very
far
removed.
it's
in
the
mountains
somewhere.
and
i
choose
to
leave
my
curtains
open
and
my
blinds
up.
the
fact
is
the
public
can
look
in.
but
there's
never
any
of
the
public
up
there,
or
very
rarely
is.
could
a
police
officer
choose
to
go
by
and
look
in?
unknown
speaker
right.
is
the
mere
fact
that
there
are
not
many
people
normally
on
that
street
enough
to
create
in
me
an
expectation
that's
valid
against
the
law?
unknown
speaker
on,
so
the
police
cannot
look
into
open
windows
in
country
homes?
only
in
city
homes?
unknown
speaker
it's
a
public
road,
it's
just
not
used
very
often.
unknown
speaker
it's
sort
of
like
the
air
space.
unknown
speaker
it's
a
public
road
but
the
public
rarely
uses
it.
there
is
almost
never
anybody
up
there.
unknown
speaker
why
is
that
different
from
the
helicopter
example
then?
unknown
speaker
there
are
very
rarely
helicopters
up
there,
but
they
are
free
to
be
there.
unknown
speaker
just
as
the
public
very
rarely
goes
up
this
mountain
road
i'm
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
but,
could
the...
in
justice
scalia's
example,
a
policeman
you
say
could
look
in
the
window
from
the
road,
from
the
public
road.
well,
would
he
have
to
drive
on?
could
he
stop
and
stare
at
the
window
saying,
"i
can't
believe
my
eyes;
i'd
better
make
sure?
"
unknown
speaker
so,
it
isn't
the
circling
by
the
helicopter
that
really
gets
you,
is
it?
it's
just...
would
be
all
right
if
the
helicopter
just
flew
across
at
400
feet
and
took
a
picture
which
permitted
the
warrant
to
be
issued?
unknown
speaker
and
so
your
answer...
your
position
would
be
the
same
if
the
helicopter
just
flew
across--
unknown
speaker
--the
property
at
400
feet--
unknown
speaker
--and
took
a
single
picture,
which
was
adequate
to
get
a
warrant?
unknown
speaker
mr.
salton,
if
we
do
reach
the
curtilage
issue
in
our
disposition
of
this
case,
do
you
think
it
makes
some
difference,
or
does
it
make
no
difference,
the
fact
that
there
was
a
commercial
raising
of
contraband
going
on
in
the
greenhouse?
it
wasn't
just
a
kitchen
garden,
so
to
speak.
unknown
speaker
it
was
just
home
consumption?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
testimony
at
all
in
the
record
on
that
point?
unknown
speaker
so,
all
we
know
then
is
that
the
greenhouse
was
devoted
to
the
raising
of
contraband?
the
greenhouse
had
44
marijuana
plants.
which
are
contraband.
unknown
speaker
yeah.
do
you
think
we
should
take
that
into
consideration
in
deciding
whether
or
not
this
complies
with
the
curtilage
rule?
unknown
speaker
what
if
there
were
hundreds
of
marijuana
plants
in
this
greenhouse?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
anything
else
in
the
greenhouse
except
those
43
plants?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
is
it
associated
with
the
home
in
the
sense
that
the
phencyclidine
was
not
associated
with
the
home.
they
are
both
close
physically.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
the
result
in
dunn
would
have
been
different
if
the
phencyclidine
operation
in
the
barn
were
as
close
as
this
greenhouse?
unknown
speaker
you
think
a
marijuana
garden
is
as
connected
with
the
domestic
activities
as
an
herb
garden
or
a
bunch
of
tomato
plants
or
something
like
that?
unknown
speaker
part
of
the
domestic
activities
of
the
house,
raising
marijuana?
unknown
speaker
in
ciraolo
the
court
found--
unknown
speaker
--it
was?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
salton,
do
you
rely
on
the
fact
that
they
where
specifically
looking
at
this
piece
of
property?
would
the
case
be
any
different
if
they
had
a
routine
practice
of
flying
up
and
down
through
this
area
at
400
feet--
unknown
speaker
--when
they
found
this
stuff?
unknown
speaker
but,
again,
you
don't
rely
on
that
though?
it
would
have
been
the
same
case
if--
unknown
speaker
--they
had
just
been
flying
by
at
400
feet?
unknown
speaker
i
expect
a
lot
of
people
don't
engage
in
nude
sunbathing
in
their
back
yards
because
of
helicopters,
i
would
expect.
certainly
in
urban
areas
they
probably
don't
engage
in
that
practice
on
apartment
house
roofs
for
that
reason.
so,
i
mean,
what's
so
extraordinary
about
the
fact
that
if
you
want
to
have
privacy,
even
inside
your
home,
you'd
better
put
a
roof
over
it?
unknown
speaker
just
to
stop
you
from
growing
marijuana,
that's
all.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
let's
talk
about
that
a
minute.
isn't
there
rather
wide
use
these
days
of
police
helicopters
to
apprehend
suspects
in
cases
of
violent
crime
in
urban
areas?
unknown
speaker
and
don't
they
come
down
fairly
close
to
the
ground
to
try
to
see
if
someone
is
fleeing
or
around
in
an
area
where
some
serious
crime
has
been
committed?
unknown
speaker
and
the
rule
you'd
have
us...
well,
fairly
often
one
reads
about
it.
the
rule
you'd
have
us
adopt
might
discourage
that
kind
of
use,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
just
wouldn't
be
able
to
use
the
evidence
that
they
saw
the
suspect
running
down
the
alley
or
something
of
that
sort?
