mr.
marc
h.
salton
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
it
pleases
the
court,
it
is
the
position
of
the
respondent
that
this
case
should
be
determined
within
the
framework
of
katz
versus
the
united
states.
and
under
katz
versus
the
united
states,
the
two
controlling
questions
are
whether
michael
riley
manifested
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
contents
of
his
greenhouse,
and,
two,
whether
that
expectation
is
one
that
society
is
prepared
to
recognize
as
reasonable.
in
answering
the
first
question,
of
whether
riley
manifested
that
expectation
of
privacy,
we
would
submit
that
the
record
is
complete
with
facts
showing
that
manifestation.
the
wooded
area,
the
fence
around
the
mobile
home
and
greenhouse,
the
positioning
of
that
greenhouse
directly
behind
the
mobile
home
so
it
was
viewable
from
the
roadway,
and,
as
mr.
riley
testified,
from
any
adjoining
property.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
i
would
submit
that
if
it's
within
the
curtilage
there
the
expectations...
he
has
heightened
expectations
and
there
is
an
indicia
of
reason
to
his
expectation
if
we're
dealing
with
the
curtilage.
the
curtilage
bears
directly
upon
the
reasonableness
of
the
privacy
expectations.
and
the
only
reason
i'm
mentioning
the
manifestation
of
those
expectations
is
apparently
florida,
at
least
in
their
brief,
appeared
to
contest
that.
our
submission,
of
course,
is
with
the
root,
the
enclosed
two
sides,
the
fact
that
shrubbery
and
the
mobile
home
blocked
view
from
the
unenclosed
sides.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
yes.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
yes.
as
katz
teaches
us,
the
fact
that
something
is
in
the
curtilage
or
the
home,
if
an
activity
or
an
object
is
knowingly
exposed
to
the
public,
it
will
lose
the
fourth
amendment
protection.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
yes,
he
can.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
no,
i
would
submit
it's
not.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
because
the
viewing
is
from
a
non-public
place.
when
the
curtains
are
left--
mr.
marc
h.
salton
--it's
our
submission
that
400
feet
and
circling
a
private
residence
is
not
like
a
public
thoroughfare.
the--
mr.
marc
h.
salton
--i
would
concede
that
it's
arguably
that
it
was,
assuming
faa
regulations
are
not
violated,
that
it
is
a
lawful
place.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
no,
we
have
not--
mr.
marc
h.
salton
--made
that
allegation.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
approximately.
a
lawful
place,
though,
does
not
equate,
justice
o'connor,
to
continue
the
answer
to
your
question,
with
a
public
place.
and
i
think
it
goes
back
to
your
first
question.
if
the
curtains
are
left
open
and
the
police
officer
views
it
from
the
sidewalk
leading
to
the
house
or
from
the
roadway,
that's
from
the
public
place.
but
if
the
police
officer,
to
view
into
the
open
curtain,
has
to
climb
a
tree
on
a
neighbor's
yard,
that
may
be
a
lawful
place,
but
it's
not
a
public
place.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
no.
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
it
under
the
facts
of
the
particular
case
and
determine
whether
in
fact
that
is
an
area
that
the
public
would
reasonably
be
expected
to
be
or
is
normally
in
that
place.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
flying
overhead
but
not
at
400
feet
or
less
and
circling
private
residence.
or
be
accustomed
to
air
traffic,
whether
helicopter
or
fixed-wing
airplanes,
is
in
the
higher
altitudes.
i
mean,
altitudes
talked
about
in
ciraolo
and--
mr.
marc
h.
salton
--i'm
not
so
sure
it's
public
property.
congress
has
given
the
public
a
right
of
transit
through
navigable
air
space.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
i
would
submit
it's
not
public
property.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
a
helicopter
may
fly
through
it.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
yes.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
i
would
submit
if
they
could
fly
through
it,
they
can
take
a
picture
from
it.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
yes,
that
person
can
be
a
policeman.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
i
would
say
a
private
citizen
does
not
normally
fly
around
in
a
helicopter.
but,
of
course,
i
think
common
knowledge
is
that
some
private
citizens
do
use
helicopters
for--
mr.
marc
h.
salton
--no,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
i
would
submit
that
your
question
goes
to
the
reasonableness
of
a
person's
expectations
of
privacy.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
yes.
i
would
submit
that
it
is
enough
to
create
that
expectation
of
privacy.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
if
they
position
themselves
in
a
non-public
vantage
point
where
the
public--
mr.
marc
h.
salton
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
thought
you
meant--
mr.
marc
h.
salton
--you
meant...
i
misunderstood
your
question.
if
he's
on
the
public
road--
mr.
marc
h.
salton
--if
the
public
uses
that
road,
then
i
would
submit
that
the
police
could
look
at
it.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
because--
mr.
marc
h.
salton
--but
they
don't
fly
at
that
altitude
and
circle
private
residences.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
if
400
feet
was
the
particular
viewing
in
this
case...
or,
at
least,
we
know
at
least
400
feet.
it
may
have
been
lower,
but
that's
unclear.
we
know
that
the
contents
of
that
greenhouse
were
not
viewable
from
the
altitude
that
the
police
helicopter
first
flew
to
arrive
over
riley's
residence.
it
was
not
until...
and
the
record
indicates
that
the
pilot
indicated
that
they
were
a
lot
higher
when
they
flew
in
than
when
they
circled.
that
did
not
become
visible
until
they
lowered
to
400
feet,
or
possibly
less,
and
circled
the
residence.
at
that
time,
he
was
able
to
be
in
a
position
that
he
could
see.
and
what
i
am
submitting
is
that
that
is
different
than
the
individual
on
the
public
road
seeing
into
a
window,
even
if
the
public
road
is
not
used
frequently.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
if
the
window
is
open
to
the
public
road,
i
would
assume
the
police
officer
could
stop.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
my
position
is
that
at
400
feet
it
would
not
because
helicopters
don't
normally
fly
at
400
feet.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
just
flew
over.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
at
that
altitude.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
yes,
that
would
be
still
my
position
because
i
think
public
can
normally
stop
and
does
stop
on
public
roads,
but
they
don't
do
the
circling
maneuvers
and
so
forth
in
the
airways.
i
think,
as
justice
scalia
indicated
in
his
concurrent
opinion
in
o'connor
versus
ortega,
the
fourth
amendment
protects
privacy,
not
solitude.
and
i
would
submit
that
it's
not
the
public.
i
think
our
society
does
not
require
the
public
to
close
up
their
homes,
their
windows
from
the
chance
or
the
non-public
areas,
shut
out
light,
shut
out
nature,
on
the
fear
that
somebody
is
going
to
surveil
their
home.
i
don't
think
society
requires
that.
society
requires
people
to
take
normal
precautions.
and
that
is
precautions
from
where
the
public
is
expected
to
be.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
well,
i
would
have
to
take
issue
with
the
commercial
raising
of--
mr.
marc
h.
salton
--we
are
talking
basically
44
marijuana
plants,
and
i
would
submit
that
44
marijuana
plants
does
not
make
a
commercial
operation.
the
court
in
ciraolo
indicated
they
had
little
difficulty
determining
that
his
back
yard
was
curtilage,
and
that
contained
73
marijuana
plants.
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
michael
riley
ever
distributed,
sold,
or
intended
to
distribute
or
sell
one
ounce
of
marijuana.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
none
at
all.
and--
mr.
marc
h.
salton
--which
are
illegal.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
no.
not
the
fact
that
it
contained
a
plant
that
was
illegal.
if
we
were
dealing
with
the
phencyclidine
laboratory
that's
depicted
in
dunn
where
sophisticated
chemicals
are
used,
trucks
are
going
in
and
out,
where
we
do
have
a
large
scale
production
of
drugs--
mr.
marc
h.
salton
--if
there
was
a
showing
that
we
were
dealing
with
the
same
type
of
situation
in
dunn,
then
that
would
be
a
factor
for
the
court
to
consider.
but
the
mere
presence
of
an
illegal
plant,
i
submit,
does
not
take
it
out
of
the
realm
of
the
curtilage.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
the
record
just
shows
44
marijuana
plants
were
in
the
greenhouse.
and
our
position
is
that
it's
a
gardening
activity;
obviously
an
illegal
activity,
but
still
activity
associated
with
the
home.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
well,
one
of
the
factors
in
dunn
was
the...
i
think
the
court's
determination
that
the
barn
where
the
laboratory
was,
was
outside
the
perimeter
of
the
home,
the
fence
perimeter
of
the
home,
and
at
least
60
yards
form
the
home.
and
determined
that
that
was
a
factor
to
show
that
it
was
not
connected
or
close
to
the
home,
like
our
greenhouse
house
is.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
i
think
it
would
be
a
factor
that
the
court
would
consider.
the
court
indicated
that
it
was
not
so
that
was
more
reason
to
consider
it
not
part
of
the
curtilage,
but--
mr.
marc
h.
salton
--i
think
unless
it's
a
commercial
operation,
it's
a
gardening
activity.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
unless
it's
shown
as
a
commercial
activity,
i
would
submit
it
is.
and
it's
no
different...
the
structure
in
that
location
is
no
different
than
the
bathhouse,
than
the
workshed,
whatever
you
would
see
at
that
location.
the
importance,
obviously,
of
curtilage
is
that
it
bears
on
riley's
reasonableness
of
his
expectations
of
privacy
because
society
has
long
recognized
the
home
and
curtilage
as
harboring
a
fundamental
right
to
be
free
from
government
intrusion.
and
unless
riley
does
some
act
to
expose
the
contents
of
that
greenhouse
to
the
general
public,
he's
entitled
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
privacy
expectations.
if
we
look
at
florida's
bright-line
rule,
which
is
what
they're
requesting,
and
that
is
basically
that
the
helicopter
should
be
able
to
fly
wherever
faa
regulations
allow
it
to
fly,
what
you
then
have
are
faa
regulations
which
are
safety
regulations
dictating
or
having
a
significant
bearing
on
fourth
amendment
privacy
rights.
and
i
would
submit
that
those
regulations
have
no
bearing
on
privacy
and
on
the
fourth
amendment.
the
faa
can
change
those
regulations
and
basically
what
you
have
is
a
member
of
part
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
dictating
fourth
amendment
privacy
rights.
an
interesting
aspect
of
that
would
be
that
the
faa
regulations
under
visual
flight
regulations,
called
vfr,
restrict
helicopters
to
300
feet
in
congested
areas.
in
rural
areas,
they
have
no
limitations
as
far
as
height
limitations.
which
would
basically
mean
that
an
individual
in
an
urban
area
where
homes
are
right
on
top
of
each
other,
at
least
under
the
faa,
would
have
more
legitimate
privacy
expectations
than
someone
in
a
rural
area.
and
i
would
submit
that
that
defines
common
sense
and
defies
the
purposes
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
yes.
i
think
the
court
found
that
ciraolo
was
within
the
curtilage.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
it
was
within
the
curtilage.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
they
made
that
finding.
i
think
the
import
of
ciraolo,
and
this
again
goes
to
the
public
nature
of
the
view,
of
the
vantage
point
of
the
observation,
at
least
eight
times
within
that
case
there
were
phrases
such
as
"public
thoroughfare",
"public
vantage
point",
"public
nature
of
the
view",
and
the
fact
that
ciraolo
had
opened
his
marijuana
garden
to
the
sky,
so
to
speak...
there
was
no
enclosure,
he
took
no
precautions
to
view
or
to
stop
any
member
of
the
public
who
happened
to
fly
over
in
the
air
where
the
public
normally
flies
from
viewing
the
marijuana...
was
a
distinction
in
that
case.
and,
as
the
court
said,
the
police
are
simply
not
required
to
avert
their
eyes
if
they're
in
the
same
place
the
public
is
in
normally.
and
here,
riley
took
precautions
to
avert
the
viewing
of
this
from
the
sky.
the
fact
that
he
was
not
completely
successful,
the
fact
that
the
police
were
able
to
position
themselves
in
a
position
that
again
the
public
doesn't
ordinarily
use
to
view
these
plants
does
not
make
his
expectation
unreasonable.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
i
think
the
court--
mr.
marc
h.
salton
--the
court
pretty
well
rejected
that
argument
in
ciraolo
and
made
the
determination
that
the
fact
that
that
was
a
focused
viewing
had
no
distinctions
under
the
fourth
amendment.
of
course,
this
was
a
much
more
focused
viewing
than
that
in
which
occurred
in
ciraolo.
we
went
much
lower
and
they
could
see
much
more.
and--
mr.
marc
h.
salton
--no,
i--
mr.
marc
h.
salton
--i'm
not
relying
on
that.
and
that's
based
on
this
court's
decision
in
the
ciraolo
case.
florida's
bright-line
rule,
basically
it
would
allow
a
helicopter
to
view
everything
before
it
as
long
as
it's
flying
in
a
safe
manner.
and
that
basically
is
from
50
feet
to
100
feet.
not
only
the
views
of
our
curtilage
is
open
to
the
police,
but
the
inside
of
our
homes.
if
the
helicopter
could
fly
at
25
feet
with
safety
within
the
faa
regulations
and
then
could
see
the
interior
of
a
home...
and
i
think
of
the
california
contemporary
homes
or,
as
justice
o'connor
indicated,
the
southwestern
homes
with
open
areas,
all
that
is
open
to
the
view
of
the
police.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
well,
how
about
a
large
glass
opened
area
of
a
window?
a
helicopter
would
have
a
view
into
the
interior
of
the
home
where
the
intimacies
of
private
lives
take
place.
and
i
don't
think
society
is
prepared
to
say
that
we
need
to
shut
ourselves
up
in
lock-tight,
airtight
boxes
so
that
the
government
can't
look
in.
and
basically
that's
what
would
happen
under
the
theory
of
the
government's
case
of
a
public
vantage
point.
i
submit
that
it
would
be
no
different
if
the
police
took
the
goodyear
blimp
and
hovered
it
400
feet
or
300
feet
over
a
house
and
from
there
could
view
everything
that
was
before
it,
everything
that
the
family
was
coins,
the
private
lives
of
the
individuals.
there
wouldn't
be
any
noise,
there
wouldn't
be
any
disruptions,
and
conceivably
the
blimp
was
in
a
lawful
place.
but
is
society
prepared
to
require
everybody
to
shut
ourselves
off
from
light,
from
nature,
from
the
beauty
of
their
surroundings
and
basically--
mr.
marc
h.
salton
--well,
the
fact
that
marijuana
was
growing
here
obviously
resulted
in
this
case.
but
the
point
is
that
if
the
police
can
do
it
in
this
case,
they
can
look
at
people's
associations,
the
political
associations
that
they
have.
noncriminal
activity
is
also
an
issue
here.
the
privacy
of
an
individual
in
the
home
and
in
his
yard
is
what
is
at
stake
in
this
particular
case.
and
if
you
allow
the
police,
whether
by
means
of
a
helicopter,
whether
by
means
of
a
hot
air
balloon,
whether
by
means
of
climbing
a
tree,
and
being
in
a
public
place
and
looking
into
the
home
and
the
protected
area
around
the
home,
society
suffers.
and
it
suffers
for
what
i
submit
are
not
legitimate
law
enforcement
purposes.
and
obviously
society
needs
to
balance
their
privacy
with
legitimate
law
enforcement
concerns,
but
that's
not
at
stake
here.
as
the
very
well
researched
brief
of
petitioner
indicates,
they
found
approximately
5c-some
reported
cases
dealing
with
aerial
surveillance.
well,
approximately
nine,
or
ten
or
eleven,
dealt
with
surveillance
of
the
curtilages
and
only
five
or
six
dealt
with
surveillance
of
structures
within
the
cartilage.
the
vast
majority
of
those
cases
dealt
with
marijuana
production
in
the
open
fields
where
large
acreage,
with
large
tracts
of
marijuana
are
being
grown,
whether
on
hillsides,
whether
in
the
woods.
that
is
the
marijuana
production
in
which
the
law
enforcement
needs
to
have
its
legitimate
concerns.
the
backyard
marijuana
plots,
so
to
speak,
is
an
insignificant
aspect
of
helicopter
use.
a
determination
by
this
court
that
a
viewing
by
the
police
from
a
helicopter
any
other
area
of
the
home
or
the
curtilage
when
privacy
precautions
have
been
taken
is
a
search
requiring
a
search
warrant,
and
does
not
affect
the
surveillance
of
the
open
fields.
it
does
not
affect
the
helicopter
use
to
apprehend
fleeing
felons.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
it
is
used.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
i
wouldn't
call
it
frequent.
mr.
marc
h.
salton
i
think
the
helicopter
can
fly
there
lawfully.
so,
the
police
can
do
that
in
terms
of--
mr.
marc
h.
salton
--no,
because
there
you
have
a
fleeing
felon
situation
and
i
believe
that
has
always
been
or
frequently
found
to
be
an
exception
to
the
search
warrant
requirement,
the
apprehension
of
a
fleeing
felon.
consequently,
there
wouldn't
be
a
requirement
for
a
warrant
in
that
situation.
so,
the
ruling
in
this
case
would
not
affect
the
use
of
helicopters.
we're
simply
talking
about
the
use
of
helicopter
to
look
into
our
homes.
and
i
would
submit
that
society,
balancing
that
off,
the
interests
of
the
home,
the
privacy
of
the
families
and
individuals
in
the
home
or
the
curtilage,
outweighs
the
limited
law
enforcement
use
that
we
have
in
this
particular
situation.
the
fact
that
a
helicopter
is
intrusive
or
non-intrusive
is
not
necessarily
the
factor
itself.
the
viewing
of
our
intimate
activities
is
just
as
disturbing,
is
just
as
violative
of
privacy
rights
to
whether
it's
accompanied
by
noise
or
not.
and
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
allowing
surveillance
at
low
altitudes,
below
the
altitudes
normally
used
by
the
public,
in
such
a
manner
to
view
into
the
curtilages
and
the
privacies
of
our
home
is
repugnant
to
the
fourth
amendment,
it's
repugnant
to
a
free
society,
and
i
would
urge
this
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
florida
supreme
court.
thank
you.
