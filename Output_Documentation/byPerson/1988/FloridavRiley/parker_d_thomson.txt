mr.
parker
d.
thomson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
barebones
facts
in
this
case
are
set
forth
in
the
trial
court's
order
granting
a
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
in
this
case.
they
were
reprinted
in
the
text
of
the
intermediate
appellate
order
which
reached
the
contrary
conclusion.
and
they
were
described
by
the
supreme
court
in
reversing
again.
these
facts
were,
first,
that
defendant
riley
had
leased
an
over
five
acre
parcel
in
pasco
county,
florida
on
which
he
placed
his
mobile
home
and
nearby
constructed
a
shed,
described
by
the
trial
court
as
a
greenhouse.
the
greenhouse
was
some
10
to
20
feet
from
the
mobile
home.
the
greenhouse,
as
constructed
by
the
defendant,
was
enclosed
on
two
sides
and
open
on
two
sides.
trees
and
shrubbery
obscured
one
of
the
open
sides
from
view.
the
mobile
home
and
one
or
more
other
trees
obscured
the
other
open
side
from
view
from
the
nearby
road.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
it
does
not,
your
honor.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
nor
does
it
show
how
far
from
the
road.
it
is
a
barebones
record.
it
does
not
show...
there
are
six
photographs
in
the
record
which
are
mainly
concentrated
on
the
mobile
home
and
the
greenhouse.
the
roof
of
the
greenhouse
was
corrugated
roofing,
partly
translucent,
partly
opaque.
there
were
two
openings
caused
by
either
removing
or
not
installing
the
roof
panels.
the
open
portion
was
about
ten
percent
of
the
roof.
a
"do
not
enter"
sign
was
posted
in
front
of
the
mobile
home.
the
area
containing
the
mobile
home
and
the
greenhouse
was
enclosed
or
partially
enclosed
by
a
net
wire
fence.
a
pasco
county
deputy
received
a
tip
about
possible
drug
manufacture
on
the
property.
that
deputy
and
deputy
gell,
a
police
officer
for
14
years,
went
to
look
from
the
road
nearby.
they
could
not
see
into
the
greenhouse.
gell
did
not
attempt
to
walk
on
the
property
outside
of
the
fenced
area
to
a
point
where
he
would
be
able
to
see
through
one
of
the
two
open
sides
of
the
greenhouse
nor
did
he
enter
property
adjoining
the
riley
tract
to
see
what
he
could
see
from
there.
instead,
he
got
a
police
pilot
to
fly
him
over
the
property
in
the
police
helicopter.
the
helicopter
circled
the
greenhouse
twice
at
about
400
feet.
gell,
who
had
viewed
cannabis
some
hundred
times
and
some
six
times
from
the
air,
identified
by
naked
eye
viewing
the
tall
marijuana
plants
through
the
roof
openings
and
through
the
open
sides.
he
took
two
pictures
of
them
with
a
camera.
the
helicopter
then
left.
a
warrant
was
issued
on
the
basis
of
gell's
affidavit.
the
premises
were
entered
and
44
plants
seized.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
it
apparently
did,
your
honor.
the
affidavit--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--[inaudible]--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--no.
there
is...
the
camera
had
a
zoom
lens.
gell
testified
that
he
had
no
particular
experience
on
how
to
use
a
camera
of
that
sort
and
what
he
did
was
in
effect
to
memorialize
what
he
saw.
the
affidavit
that
he
gave,
as
representative--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
no,
your
honor.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
it
is
accepted
by
all
courts,
including
the
trial
court
which,
of
course,
heard
his
testimony,
that
detective
gell
could
see
what
he
testified
about
and
what
was
the
basis
of
the
warrant.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
it
is
400
feet,
your
honor.
400
feet.
the
helicopter
was
at
400
feet
above.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
it's
hard
to
answer
that
question.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
well,
he
saw...
he
looked
from
the
road.
he
did
not
walk
through
the
open
fields
around
the
fence
and
attempt
to
look
from
there.
he
did
not
go
on
adjacent
property.
there
is
a
greenhouse
with
two
open
sides.
we
know
what
he
did.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
not
on
the
basis
of
what
he
saw
from
the
road.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
he
could
not
see
it
from
the
road.
there
may
have
been
other
ways
to
see
it.
we
only
know
what
he
did,
justice
marshall.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
as
i
said,
44
plants
were
seized.
their
height
was
somewhere
from
six
to
12
feet.
riley
guesses
eight
feet
high.
riley
was
charged
with
manufacture
and
possession.
the
florida
supreme
court
reinstituted
the
trial
court's
order
to
suppress
the
evidence
here.
in
so
doing,
the
florida
supreme
court
purported
to
follow
this
court's
1986
decision
in
ciraolo
and
concluded
that
the
helicopter,
because
it
had
flown
below
the
minimum
limit
for
a
fixed-wing
aircraft
was
not
at
a
location
where
ciraolo
permitted
the
helicopter
to
be
for
purposes
of
making
lawful
observation.
but
the
florida
supreme
court
acknowledged
that
the
helicopter
was
where
it
was
entitled
to
be.
florida
seeks
reversal
and
adoption
of
a
rule
that
warrantless,
naked
eye,
aerial
observation
by
law
enforcement
personnel
is
permissible
under
the
fourth
amendment
so
long
as
the
observer
is
where
he
has
the
legal
right
to
be
for
all
other
purposes,
provided
there
is
no
physical
intrusion,
examples
of
which
have
been
interminable
hovering,
raising
clouds
of
dust,
creating
unreasonable
noise,
and
those
sorts
of
things,
nor
harassment,
as
there
is
in
certain
other
cases
raised
by
the
respondent
in
the
amicus
on
that
side.
florida
submits
that
this
is
a
rule
simple
of
application.
it
says
that
a
pilot
may
go
for
purposes
of
aerial
observation
of
possible
criminal
activity
where
he
can
go
for
all
other
purposes.
pilots
are
licensed
personnel
who
know
where
they
can
go
and
where
they
cannot.
the
rules
governing
where
they
go
are
determined
by
the
federal
aviation
administration
for
the
safety
of
the
aircraft
piloted,
other
aircraft,
and
the
surface.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
not
necessarily,
justice
o'connor,
but
pilots
will...
pilots
under
what
i
suggest
will
go
where
they
are
entitled
to
absent
physical
intrusion
or
harassment.
both
are
issues,
of
course,
that
a
judge
would
determine
in
response
to
a
motion
to
suppress.
the
pilot
would,
of
course,
make
the
initial
determination
of
where
it
was
safe
to
go.
a
helicopter
pilot
is
free
to
go
and
stay
off
the
surface
to
the
extent
needed
to
protect
and
insure
the
safety
of
person
and
property.
obviously--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--justice
blackman,
the
issue
there,
of
course,
is
the
objectively
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
from
that
kind
of
activity.
if
that
is
what
is
the
activity
that
is
normally
conducted
there
and
people
proceed
in
that
fashion,
yes,
that
would
be
the
result
of
that
application.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
well,
i
submit--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--well,
i
would
submit,
justice
o'connor,
that
that
involves
at
least
far
different
considerations
than
the
one
posed
by
justice
blackman.
i
do
not
necessarily
believe
that
it
is
within
the
objectively
reasonable
expectations
of
privacy
that
people
are
going
to
carry
ladders
around
and
stick
them
from
a
public
sphere
against
a
wall
for
the
specific
purpose
of
going
up
and
looking
over.
the
question
that
was
asked
me
before
is
if--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--proceeding
on
the
public
road,
yes,
i
would
think
so.
if
that
is
what
is
normally
done
on
that
road.
and
that
is
a
normal
activity--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--well,
i
don't
believe
that
the
standard
is
any
more
in
this
case
than
in
any
other.
when
you
choose
to
look
at
the
expectations
of
the
person
who
is
the
subject
of
the
observation,
he
either
expects
reasonably
or
does
not
expect
that
certain
things
are
going
to
happen,
certain
people
are
going
to
see
him.
whether
it's
his
neighbor,
whether
it
is
a
policeman,
whether
it
is
a
telephone
repairman.
that
is
his
expectation.
and
that
is
what
this
court
has
the
directed...
the
focus
to.
once
you
direct
it
to
his
expectation,
subjectively
who
that
person
may
be
i
submit
is
irrelevant.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
your
honor,
i
would
submit
that
the
helicopter
can
go,
as
stated
in
the
regulations,
as
close
to
the
surface
as
not
to
create
a
hazard
to
person
of
property.
and,
in
addition,
so
as
not,
under
the
circumstances
of
that
particular
helicopter...
of
course,
helicopters
are
all
different
in
size
and
noise,
and
so
forth
like
that...
so
that
it
did
not
create
a
physical
intrusion
on
the
surface
or
to
the
property.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
well,
whether--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--it
could.
it
depends,
your
honor,
on
the
degree...
on
the
degree
of
noise
and
the
degree
of--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--your
honor,
rules
are
set
for
the
bulk
of
the
cases.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
it
would
depend
on
the
size
of
the
helicopter.
it
would
depend
upon
the
amount
of
noise
it
kicked
up.
it
would
depend
upon
its
impact
on
the
ground.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
that
is...
if
it
is--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--the
rule
is
that
it
be
within
lawful
air
space
and--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--and
it
not
be,
as
the
rule
itself
says,
it
not
be
a
hazard
to
person
or
property
on
the
surface.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
then,
your
honor,
the
helicopter
can--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--the
helicopter
can
go
to
the
point
that
it
is
not
a
hazard
to
person
or
property.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
i
have
said,
across
open
fields,
your
honor--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--you
cross
open
fields
with
no
problem.
when
you
reach
a
congested
area,
i
have
said
that
if
in
fact,
despite
compliance
with
the
rule,
it
constitutes
a
physical
intrusion
in
certain
cases--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--which
would
be--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--i
would
submit,
your
honor,
under
certain
circumstances
huge
helicopters,
military
type
helicopters
without--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--could
without
question--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--i
doubt,
your
honor,
that
it
would
cause,
let
us
say
in
that
case
below
a
hundred
feet,
sufficient
physical
intrusion
and
i
include
noise
within
that
to
be
a
problem.
a
small
helicopter
holding
two
people.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
no,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
it
is
not
that.
it
says...
that's
where
you
start
and--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
well,
too
noisy
to
whom?
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
there
is
absolutely
no
contention
whatsoever
in
this
record,
nor
have
i
seen
a
contention
in
the
record
of
any
reported
case
involving
helicopters
that
at
400
feet
they
are
causing
disturbance
to
the
ground.
four
hundred
feet
is
virtually
the
height
of
the
washington
monument.
i
do
not
believe--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--five
hundred
and
twelve
feet
i
believe
is
the
washington
monument.
it
is--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--there
is
none
here,
no
record
in
this
case,
no
suggestion
in
this
case,
your
honor,
nor
in
any
other
reported
case
that
i
have
seen
that
400
feet...
a
helicopter
flying
at
400
feet
is
in
any
way
a
problem
to
the
ground
or
creates
any
kind
of
physical
intrusion.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
a
little
over
five,
your
honor.
the
record
simply
says
over
five
acres.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
your
honor,
the
rule
would
be
the
same.
that
is,
i
do
not
say
in
the
open
fields
portion
of
this,
of
the
clear
open
fields
portion
of
this
property
that
it
could
create
any
physical
intrusion.
obviously,
when
it
comes
over
trees
and
so
forth
near
the
greenhouse,
it
may
have
to
lift
up.
it
can
probably
go
lower,
in
accordance
with
the
faa
regulations
in
the
open
area.
but
that's
hard
to
tell
without
looking
at
a
picture
of
it.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
no,
i
think
you
have
some--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--what
i
think
you're...
i
think
when
you
have
interminable
hovering
of
that
sort,
you
could
have
different,
you
could
have
a
different
rule.
but
i
would
suggest
generally
not.
helicopters
can
fly
over...
not
just
police
helicopters,
people
taking
pictures
for
real
estate,
people
taking...
news
photographers.
there
are
helicopters
all
over
florida
and
all
over
the
united
states
today
for
a
whole
variety
of
purposes.
and
it
is
the
submission
of
the
state
of
florida
that
that
is
today
one
of
the
factors
that
are
to
be
considered
in
what
is
an
objectively
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
people
may
not
like
it,
and
they
may
not
like
all
other
kinds
of
helicopters
up
there,
but
that
is
part
of
life
today.
and
it
is
our
submission
that
police
helicopters
can
do
what
other
helicopters
can
do.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
there
could
be.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
there
could
be.
the--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--there
are,
it
seems
to
me,
two
possible
contentions
of
a
civil
cause
of
action.
one
would
be
for
a
nuisance
and
one
would
be
for
invasion
of
privacy.
depending
upon
what
was
seen
and
what
was
done
with
it,
yes,
i
think
there
could
be
a
cause
of
action
for
invasion
of
privacy.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
there
is
no
more--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--i
believe
that
this
court
for
fourth
amendment
standards
has
said
that
violations
of
local
law
are
not
the
factors
to
be
determined
in--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--no,
your
honor.
it
would
have
to
be
an
unreasonable
interference
with
privacy.
and
it
would
have
to
be
utilized
in
a
certain
way
so
that
it
was
damage
to
the
person.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
those
are
the
standard
rules
for
a
civil
case
for
privacy.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
i
believe,
your
honor,
the
pilot
of
a
police
helicopter
can
fly
wherever
the
pilot
of
any
other
helicopter
can
fly.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
no,
i--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--no,
i
did
not...
i
do
not
need
that
and
i
do
not
argue
for
that.
but
i
do
not
think
i
can
go
to
the
basement
of
this
building
either.
that's
why
the
rule
i
suggested
was
that
a
police
officer
could
do
what
a
member
of
the
public
could
do.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
i
don't
believe
that
a
member
of
the
public
can
go
into
this--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--did
not
contemplate--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--oh,
actually,
it--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--it
depends
on
the
formulation.
actually,
in
the
oliver
case,
both
sides
argued
to
this
case
that
aerial
surveillance
of
the
open
fields
was
not
a
problem
and
used
helicopters
as
an
example
during
argument.
and
the
court
notes
it
in
the
case.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
that's
not
justice
holmes'
case
of
hester;
helicopters
have
been
around
for
a
long,
long
time
but
they
were
not
in
normal
use
until
the
1940s
and
1950s.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
well,
helicopters
have
been
around
the
whole
20th
century
but
it
did
not
come
into
normal
regular
use
until
the
'50s
and
into
heavy
police
use
until
the
'60s
and
forward.
it
was
not
normally
around
at
the
time
of
the
hester
case,
your
honor.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
absolutely
not.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
absolute
not.
i
was
trying
to
respond
to
a
hypothetical
question
of
whether
there
could,
under
certain
circumstances,
be
an
invasion
of
privacy
claim.
i
said,
yes,
it's
a
tort
in
the
state
of
florida
and
it
could
be
used
on
this
set
of
facts.
i
would
submit
absolutely
not.
not
a
shred
of
a
basis
for
an
invasion
of
privacy
claim.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
i
suspect,
your
honor,
that's
right.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
helicopters
go
down...
helicopters
can
go
down
to
where
they
will
not
be
a
hazard
to
surface
or
property.
that
is
correct.
and
it
depends
on
the
helicopter,
the
size
of
the
helicopter,
and
so
forth,
how
far
that
helicopter
can
go
down.
the
submission
that
we
make
to
this
court
is
that
the
florida
supreme
court
incorrectly
drew
a
line
based
upon
the
words
500
feet
in
rural
areas,
and
a
thousand
feet
in
urban
areas,
must
be
the
test
for
helicopters.
they
drew
those
rules,
of
course,
from
the
faa
regulations
with
respect
to
fixed-wing
aircraft.
they
contended
that
the
helicopter
flight
below
that
was
barred
by
this
court's
reference
in
ciraolo
to
navigable
airspace.
however,
a
look
at
ciraolo
in
our
opinion
does
not
justify
that
conclusion.
the
reference
in
ciraolo
to
navigable
airspace
was
in
the
context
of
the
airplanes
involved
in
that
and
to
show
that
the
pilot
in
that
case
was
where
that
pilot
was
lawfully
entitled
to
be.
that,
we
submit,
is
the
crux
of
the
issue
in
ciraolo,
and
that
is
the
crux
of
the
issue
in
this
case.
this
pilot
went
exactly
where
he
was
lawfully
entitled
to
be,
400
feet,
took
two
swings
around
the
property,
was
able
to
identify
through
two
open
sides
and
a
ten
percent
open
roof
of
this
greenhouse
what
was
inside
it,
to
identify
it
sufficiently
to
sign
the
affidavit
and
get
the
warrant
issued.
we
submit
that
both...
that
the
supreme
court
was
wrong
as
to
this
case
and
this
case
is
facts.
we
submit
that
it
also
was
in
error
with
respect
to
not...
to
looking
at
a
rule
based
upon
what
a
fixed-wing
aircraft
can
do
rather
than
one
that
looks
to
where
the
pilots
of
police
helicopters
may
lawfully
be.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
florida
questions...
seriously
questions
that
it
was
within
the
curtilage.
it
seems
to
me,
justice
blackman,
that
this
court
in
dunn
divided
curtilage
issues
into
two.
one
distance
and
one
use.
the
distance
of
the
greenhouse
from
the
mobile
home,
the
trailer,
was
ten
to
twenty
feet.
certainly,
on
the
issue,
that
would
imply
that
that
factor
of
a
curtilage
test
was
met.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
that
is
correct.
secondly,
the
mobile
home
and
the
greenhouse
were
both
within
a
fenced
or
partially
fenced
area.
that
is,
they
appeared
to
have
been
within
a
common
enclosure.
that,
too,
would
meet
the
factor
of
distance
as
one
of
the
four
factors
of
the
dunn
case.
the
third...
the
third
and
fourth
factors
apply
to
the
issue
of
use.
the
issue
of
use,
of
course,
is
where
the
concept
of
curtilage
came
from.
that
was
an
extension
of
the
domestic
uses
of
the
house.
the
first
of
these
is
that
this
particular
greenhouse
was
used
for
the
manufacture
of
an
illegal
substance.
we
do
not
submit...
we
submit
that,
therefore,
it
does
not
meet
that
factor
of
dunn.
and,
fourthly,
the...
i
believe
it
to
be
a
carry
forward
of
the
use
factor.
the
question
was
whether
or
not
reasonable
precautions
had
been
taken
to
obscure
the
vision
of
that
from
passersby.
in
this
particular
case,
two
sides
were
open,
ten
percent
of
the
roof
was
missing,
and
patently
it
did
not
obscure
from
a
person
passing
by
in
a
helicopter
at
400
feet.
it
is
our
submission
that,
therefore,
it
does
not
meet
the
two
use
factors
of
the
dunn
test.
of
course,
there
are
four
factors.
it
has
seemed
to
us
on
reviewing
these
cases
that
this
court
in
dunn
has
indicated
a
turn
more
towards
the
use
considerations
and
whether
in
fact
what
is
being
done
there
is
an
extension
of
the
domestic
trailer.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
and
we
submit
that
this
was
not.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not
within
the
one
question
we
raised.
we
believe
it
is
here.
it
is
not
within
the
specific
terms
of
that
test.
the
issue,
your
honor,
is
one
of
the
objective
manifestation--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--your
honor,
the
trial
court
held
that
it
was
within
the
curtilage
and
it
was
held
that
in
each
of
the
courts
in
florida.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
only
to
the
extent,
your
honor,
that
the
objectively
reasonable
manifestations
of
this
subject
and
intent
for
privacy
was--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--that
is
correct;
which
was
of
course,
the
conclusion
of
ciraolo.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
we
in
no
way
split
the
curtilage
off.
we
comprehended
it
within
the
general
issue.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
your
honor,
that
is
for
your
ultimate
determination.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
my
answer
is
that
florida
seriously
questions
on
the
basis
of
what
was...
that
it
was
within
the
curtilage.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
well,
i
believe
that
it
is--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--well,
that
is
how
it
seems
to
get
into
the
cases
as
to
the
question
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
expectation
of
privacy,
and,
of
course,
it
has
been
extended...
it
has
been
argued
to
this
court
by
the
amicus
on
the
other
side
that
if
it
is
within
the
curtilage,
there
absolutely
must
be
a
determination
made...
to
that
effect
a
determination
which
i
believe
this
court
rejected
in
ciraolo.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
no
rebuttal,
your
honor.
