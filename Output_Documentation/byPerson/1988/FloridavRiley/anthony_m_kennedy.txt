justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
under
florida
law,
would
there
be
a
civil
cause
of
action
for
an
invasion
of
privacy--
justice
anthony
m.

--in
circumstances
such
as
this?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
asking
you
about
florida
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
is
that
consistent
with
your
view
that
there
is
an
objective...
that
there
is
no
objective
expectation
of
privacy?
i
don't
see
now
that
fits.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
florida
permits
a
civil
cause
of
action,
for
an
invasion
of
privacy
in
circumstances
such
as
this,
how
does
that
comport
with
your
premise
that
there
is
no
objective
expectation
of
privacy?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
well
aware
of
that,
but
i'm
just
asking
you
about
the
objective
expectation
that
a
property
owner
has.
does
florida
law
protect
people
that
have
no
objective
expectations
to
privacy
and
then
gives
them
a
cause
of
action
anyway?
