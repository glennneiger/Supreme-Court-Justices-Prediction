justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask...
you
said
you
want
a
bright-line
rule
in
effect
and
the
helicopter
was
in
lawful
air
space,
therefore,
it's
okay.
how
far
down
could
the
helicopter
go
under
your
bright-line
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
supposing
you
went
down
to
50
feet
and
it
would
be
perfectly
safe.
you
know,
it's
been
tested
out.
of
course,
it
would
be
rather
noisy
and
rather
windy,
i
suppose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
that
violate
your
bright-line
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
this
a
bright-line
rule
if
it
depends
on
a
degree
of
noise?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
how
far
can
it
go
down?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
it
does
not
depend
on
the
fact
that
it's
in
lawful
air
space.
justice
john
paul
stevens
see,
that
is
not
your
rule,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
it
not
be
annoying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
but
i'm
assuming
it's
not
hazardous
to
person
or
property
on
the
surface
when
you're
60
or
50
or
60
feet
above
the
ground.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it's
quite
noisy
and
it's
windy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
have
abandoned
your
notion
that
there
is
a
limit
based
on
the
degree
of
noise
and
wind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no.
over
a
congested
area
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--then
just
leave
it
noise
and
wind.
is
there
a
point
at
which
a
helicopter
is
perfectly
lawful
but
nevertheless
is
too
noisy
to
be
constitutionally
in
the
proper
place?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
just
the
traffic--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
traffic
helicopter
we've
all
seen
flying
around.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
rule...
i
want
to
be
clear
on
it.
your
rule
that
you
advocate
is
not
a
rule
that
says
as
long
as
it's
in
the
lawful
air
space
it's
okay?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
how
do
you
know
400
feet
wasn't
too
noisy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
we
know
400
feet
wasn't
too
noisy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
to
people
on
the
ground.
if
you're
sitting
in
your
back
yard,
you
want
helicopters
400
feet
up?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
less
than
the
height
of
the
washington
monument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it's
80
percent
of
the
height
of
the
washington
monument.
