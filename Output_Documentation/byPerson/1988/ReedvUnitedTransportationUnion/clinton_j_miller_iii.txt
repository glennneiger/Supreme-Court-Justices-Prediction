mr.
clinton
j.
miller,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
rights
sued
upon
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case
today
do
not
arise
out
of
the
federal
constitution,
nor
do
they
arise
out
of
the
civil
rights
laws.
rather,
they
arise
out
of
a
clearly
stated
continuum
of
the
national
labor
policy
in
federal
statutory
labor
law.
the
facts
have
not
been
established
in
this
case
to
the
degree
that
my
opponent
has
discussed
them
today.
for
instance,
there
is
much
dispute
with
respect
to
the
characterization
of
the
conduct
of
both
the
plaintiff
in
this
litigation,
the
petitioner
here,
as
well
as
the
general
chairman.
moreover,
the--
mr.
clinton
j.
miller,
iii
--no,
your
honor.
it
was
dismissed
on
summary
judgment.
mr.
clinton
j.
miller,
iii
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
additionally,
the
title
v
claim
that
the
plaintiff
brought
in
the
district
court
below
was
dismissed
as
procedurally
defective.
when
the
matter
was
granted
interlocutory
review
on
the
delcostello
statute
of
limitations
question,
there
was
no
cross-appeal
with
regard
to
the
title
v
claim
that
had
been
dismissed
by
the
district
court.
mr.
clinton
j.
miller,
iii
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
only
reason
that
i
mentioned
it
was
that
the...
there
were
counter-affidavits
that
were
filed
in
opposition
to
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
but
i
recognize,
your
honor,
everything
must
be
construed
in
favor
of
my
opponent
since
we
were
the
moving
party
with
regard
to
limitations
grounds.
the
petitioner,
as
well
as
the
united
states,
and
the
other
amici
supporting
the
petitioner's
position,
would
have
this
court
narrowly
construe
its
decision
in
delcostello
out
of
existence
by
failing
to
give
effect
to
all
that
was
said
in
that
decision
and
by
cutting
too
finely
the
language
chosen
to
be
analyzed.
in
delcostello,
while
this
court
noted
the
general
rule
that
in
the
absence
of
a
specific
statute
of
limitations
in
federal
statutory
law,
it
is
not
to
be
assumed
that
congress
intended
that
there
be
no
statute
of
limitations,
but
rather
to
borrow
from
some
other
source,
usually
state
law.
it
further
noted
that
state
legislatures
do
not
devise
their
statutory
statutes
of
limitations
with...
with
national
interests
in
mind.
in
so
doing,
this
court
noted
that
united
auto
workers
v.
hoosier
cardinal,
the
bench
mark
that
we're
using
here
for
the
normal
rule
of
application
of
a
state
statute
of
limitations,
involved
a
straight
section
301
lmr
claim
by
a
union,
not
a
member,
against
an
employer
that
did
not
at
all
involve
arbitration.
in
those
circumstances,
it's
hardly
surprising
that
the
ordinary
state
statute
of
limitations
with
regard
to
contracts
was
applied.
we
learned
later
that
the
reason
the
six-year
oral
contract
statute
was
applied
was
because
this
court
felt
the
15-year
written
statute
of
limitations
on
written
contracts
did
not
provide
sufficiently
for
the
rapid
resolution
of
labor
disputes.
labor
disputes
were
spoken
of
generically.
delcostello
did,
in
fact,
involve
a
hybrid
suit,
that
is,
a
suit
by
the
member
against
his
employer
for
breach
of
the
contract
and
a
suit
against
his
union
for
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
implied
in
the
law
owing
to
the
exclusive
representative
status
that
the
organization
has.
this
court
found
that,
obviously,
those
claims
were
inextricably
interdependent
because
of
its
previous
decisions
in
vaca
v.
sipes
and
hines
v.
anchor
motor
freight
for
that
reason,
deciding
that
there
could
not
be
one
statute
applicable
to
the
employer
without
a
comparable
statute
being
applicable
to
the
union
in
the
case
if
the
party
were
to
be
afforded
complete
relief.
the
court
noted
that
these
difficulties
cannot
be
tolerated
in
the
court's
view
where
there
is
a
federal
statute
that
is
designed
to
accommodate
similar
interests.
and
that's
the
key
here.
has
congress
spoken
clearly
enough
with
respect
to
landrum
griffin
title
i
rights?
we
submit
that
it
has.
in
delcostello,
it
was
very
important
to
this
court
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
consistently
found
all
breaches
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
to
constitute
unfair
labor
practices,
thus
triggering
the
operation
of
section
10(b)
with
regard
to
any
charge
filed
with
the
general
counsel
at
the
board.
however,
the
petitioner,
as
well
as
the
amici
on
that
side
of
argument,
totally
ignore
in
their
briefing
the
fact
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
taken
a
consistent
view,
not
always
agreed
to
by
the
af
of
l-cio,
that
any
union
coercion
constitutes
the
basis
for
an
appropriate
8(b)(1)(a)
charge.
there
is
ample
precedent
for
the
national
labor
relations
board
having
so
held,
and
even
as
late
as
1985.
this
court
in
delcostello
noted
that
this
court
itself
has
never
passed
upon
the
validity
of
that
board
policy,
that
is,
that
all
breaches
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
are
unfair
labor
practices.
nonetheless,
that
wasn't
important
to
this
court
because
the
family
resemblance
was
there.
we
submit
that
since
the
board
also
has
found
any
form
of
union
coercion
that
would
be
comparable
to
a
landrum
griffin
title
i
charge
to
also
constitute
an
unfair
labor
practice,
it
also
bears
a
family
resemblance,
thus
triggering
the
application
of
section
10(b).
mr.
clinton
j.
miller,
iii
yes,
justice
white,
if
the
plaintiff
had
reduced
to
writing
his
allegations
that
he
made--
mr.
clinton
j.
miller,
iii
--then
he
could
have
filed
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
with
the
general
counsel.
mr.
clinton
j.
miller,
iii
that
is
correct,
justice
white.
he
would
have
had
to
have
filed
it
within
six
months.
mr.
clinton
j.
miller,
iii
that
is
correct,
justice
white,
and
that
raises
the
important
point.
if
he
couldn't
file
it
as
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge,
why
should
he...
as
the
national
labor
relations
board
clearly
holds
that
he
can
under
its
precedent,
why
should
he
be
permitted
to
go
to
court?
the
facts
of
this
case
are...
are
truly
peculiar
on
this
point,
justice
white,
in
that--
mr.
clinton
j.
miller,
iii
--that
is--
mr.
clinton
j.
miller,
iii
--no,
justice
white,
i
am
not
intimating
that
there
is.
i...
i'm
merely
noting
that
just
as
the
board
has
consistently
held
that
all
breaches
of
a
duty
of
fair
representation
are
unfair
labor
practices,
although
most
of
that
ends
up
in
litigation,
so
too
it
has
consistently
held
that
any
form
of
union
coercion
with
regard
to
landrum
griffin
rights
or
the
exercise
thereof
are
also
unfair
labor
practices,
thus
triggering
the
application
of
10(b).
in
this
case,
the
very--
mr.
clinton
j.
miller,
iii
--i'm
sorry,
justice
white?
if
a
member?
mr.
clinton
j.
miller,
iii
yes,
justice
white.
mr.
clinton
j.
miller,
iii
that
is
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
clinton
j.
miller,
iii
he
must
do
it
within
six
months
from
the
date
of
accrual.
many
of
the
defects
that
are
discussed
here
today
by
the
petitioner
are
satisfied
in
the
accrual
analysis.
for
instance,
an
action
has
been
consistently
held
by
the
circuits
to
accrue
only
when
a
member
knows
or
in
the
exercise
of
reasonable
diligence
should
know
of
the
acts
constituting
a
claim
of
breach
of
the
duty.
with
respect
to
investigation,
that
won't
occur
until
adequate
investigation
and
knowledge
is
present.
in
this
case
the
counsel
sitting
at
this
table
for
petitioner
wrote
a
letter
to
the
president
of
the
union...
this
is
in
the
record...
stating
that
since
the
organization
had
not
adjusted
matters
satisfactorily
to
his...
to
his
client,
that
he
had
advised
his
client
to
sue
within
six
weeks,
stating
that...
that
suit...
that
he
had
recommended
to
his
client
to
sue
by
september
15,
1983.
yet,
this...
this
counsel
and
mr.
reed
waited
nearly
two
years
after
the
sending
of
that
letter.
this
case
doesn't
present
a
very
good
one
for
retention
of
counsel
as
a
factor
to
be
considered
because
counsel
was
already
retained.
the
action
did
not
accrue
until
the
counsel
wrote
a
second
letter
to
the
organization
noting
his
dissatisfaction
with
the
resolution
of
the
matter
with
the
organization
itself.
moreover,
the
factors
with
regard
to
practicalities
of
litigation
that
are
mentioned
by
the
petitioner
were
also
considered
by
this
court
in
delcostello,
the
very
same
factors.
it
was
for
that
reason...
that...
that
is
the
presence
of
the
very
factors
that
we're
talking
about
today...
that
this
court
chose
to
apply
the
six
months
from
section
10(b)
of
the
lmra
rather
than
the
shorter
arbitration
statutes
from
the
states.
with
regard
to
those
litigation
factors,
this
court
determined
that
was
just
insufficient
time.
we
would
submit
that
therefore
the
presence
of
the
factors
that
are
mentioned
by
the
petitioner
have
already
been
considered
by
this
court
and
have
already
been
determined
to
be
fully
served
by
applying
section
10(b)
of
the
act.
this
court
also
observed
in
delcostello
that
it
was
not
only
the
private
settlements
under
the
labor
laws
that
were
at
issue,
but
also
the
formation
of
the
agreement
which
is
too
little
recognized
by
the
petitioner
and
amici
on
that
side.
collective
bargaining
consists
of
negotiating
the
agreement
and
administering
that
agreement.
as
the
court
below
and
as
the
third
circuit
noted
in
the
steelworkers
case,
which
is
the
principal
case
for
the
pro-costello...
delcostello
view
here,
if
internal
problems
are
permitted
to
fester
too
long,
union
officials
become
overly
concerned
with
regard
to
their
political
struggles
and
that
detracts
from
their
ability
to
deal
with
management.
in
other
words,
whether
a
breach
of
either
landrum
griffin
or
the
duty
of
fair
representation
occurs
internally
or
externally,
the
effect
is
the
same.
both
have
been
held
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
to
constitute
unfair
labor
practice
charges.
there
is
no
reason
to
treat
them
differently.
indeed,
the
rights
that
are
protected
by
landrum
griffin
are
the
very
same
rights
that
are
at
the
core
of
the
federal
labor
laws,
the
section
7
rights
that
were
granted
by
the
wagner
act.
in...
in
taft
hartley,
the
congress
acted
to
ensure
that
those
rights,
the
rights
to
engage
in
concerted
activity,
were
not
taken
away
by
unduly
harassing
tactics
by
unions,
added
a
whole
class
of
unfair
labor
practice
charges
in
section
8(b).
in
1959
with
landrum
griffin,
the
congress
again
was
concerned
that
the
rights
that
were
so
granted
and
so
insulated
from
harassment
by
taft
hartley
would
not
be
driven
by
undemocratic
processes,
but
we're
still
talking
about
the
rights
to
collective...
to
collectively
bargain.
we're
not
talking
about
constitutional
rights.
as
this
court
soundly
noted
in
steelworkers
v.
sadlowski,
the
bill
of
rights
in
landrum
griffin
are
not
coextensive
with
first
amendment
rights
because
the
offering
of
the
bill
of
rights
by
senator
mcclellan
on
the
floor
was
modified
by
virtually
unanimous
adoption
of
a
floor
amendment
which
permitted
the
union
reasonable
regulation
of
those
rights.
this
court
does
not
permit
reasonable
regulation
of
first
amendment
rights.
and
in
that
regard--
mr.
clinton
j.
miller,
iii
--not
at
all,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'm
merely
suggesting
that
constitutional
rights
will
be
handled
differently
because
there's
an
appropriate
state
statute.
in
other
words,
this
court
has
determined
with
regard
to,
for
instance,
the
civil
rights
acts,
1983
and
1981,
that
those
are
more
in
the
nature
of
personal
injury,
and
the
constitution
is
at
the
core
of
the
enforcement
of
those
rights.
my
point
here
is
that
one
can't
leap
to
the
conclusion
that
just
because
the
statute
says
bill
of
rights,
that
that
automatically
makes
it
civil
rights.
these
are
labor
law
rights,
federal
statutory
labor
law
rights.
and
this
court
has
consistently
made
that
clear.
by
quoting
professor
cox
that
landrum
griffin
being
a
product
of
political
compromise,
one
can't
absolutely
apply
every
word,
but
must
realize
the
context
in
which
it
arose.
this
court
has
consistently
done
that
and
has
recognized
that
those
rights
are
not
coextensive
with
the
first
amendment.
again,
it
just
bolsters
the
argument
that
the
organization
has
here
that
this
class
of
rights
are
labor
law
rights.
they
all
relate
back
to
the
right
to
bargain
collectively.
they
all
were
an
attempt
to
assure
democratic
processes
within
the
union
so
that
bargaining
collectively
meant
something.
the
union
can't,
by
its
reasonable
regulation,
take
away
or
detract
from
those
rights.
if
it
does,
it
perforce
commits
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
it
should
be
dealt
with
appropriately
but
within
a
relatively
short
span
of
time
because
the
rapid
resolution
of
labor
disputes
of
any
character,
internal
or
external,
are
at
the
core
of
the
national
labor
policy
whether
they
deal
with
private
settlements
or
whether
they
deal
with
the
formation
of
agreements
initially.
some
lower
courts
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
plumbers',
as
observed
by
the
afl-cio
in
this
case,
felt
that
one
had
to
analyze
the
propriety
of
a
section
301
action
to
enforce
a
union
constitution.
this
court
had
little
difficulty
in
holding
that
section
301
was
available
as
a
remedy
for
a
violation
of
a
union
constitution.
for
the
same
reason
that
this
court
found
section
301
available
to
remedy
a
violation
of
a
union
constitution,
we
suggest
that
section
10(b)
amply
supports
an
appropriate
limitations
period
for
enforcement
of
the
rights
here.
it
should
be
a
consistent
right.
it
should
be
the
same
time
period
for
all
violations,
and
it
should
be
section
10(b)
because
that
governs
unfair
labor
practice
charges,
and
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
consistently
held
violation
of
landrum
griffin
title
i
bill
of
rights
claims
are
susceptible
to
being
filed
as
unfair
labor
practice
charges.
whether
these
rights
can
be
characterized
as
economic
or
as
civil,
the
point
is
that
they're
part
of
the
fabric
of
federal
statutory
labor
law
which
is
intended
to
protect
the
fundamental
statutory
right
to
act
collectively.
that
demands
quick
resolution
so
that
the
collective
bargaining
relationship
remains
stable.
it
doesn't
have
to
deal
with
private
settlements.
it
deals
with
the
formation
and
maintenance
of
the
agreement
itself.
overall
an
application
of
section
10(b)
as
the
appropriate
statute
of
limitations
in
this
case
will
support
the
federal
labor
law
policy
of
quick
resolution
of
labor
disputes.
the
application
of
the
three-year
north
carolina
personal
injury
statute
will
not
promote
that
interest
and
is
not
related
thereto,
it
being
at
most
related
to
civil
rights
or
constitutional
rights
actions
which
are
not
at
issue
here.
these
are
labor
rights.
these
rights
simply
cannot
be
divorced
from
the
statutory
background
in
which
they
arise.
the
federal
statute
of
limitations
is
obviously
more
appropriate.
the
federal
policy
at
stake
is
clear.
the
practicalities
of
litigation
are
no
different
in
this
matter
than
they
are
in
actions
for
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
this
court
chose
section
10(b)
in
delcostello.
it
should
choose
it
here
mandating
affirmance
of
the
decision
below.
thank
you
very
much.
