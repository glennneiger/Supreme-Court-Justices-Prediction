mr.
john
w.
gresham
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case
the
court
must
determine
whether
it
will
apply
its
longstanding
practice
of
borrowing
the
analogous
state
statute
of
limitations
and
apply
that
to
a
free
speech
claim
under
title
i
of
the
lmrda,
or
whether
it
will
apply
the
narrow
exception
to
that
normal
borrowing
procedure
which
was
described
in
delcostello
v.
teamsters,
and
in
applying
that
exception,
then
select
the
six-months'
limitation
period
of
10(b)
of
the
nlra.
the
facts
in
this
case
indicate
that
it
is
a
prototypical
title
i
claim.
it
is
retaliation
against
a
union
member
for
protesting
both
the
improper
use
of
union
funds
and
for
opposing
a
dues
increase
in
the
local.
what
are
these
facts?
well,
mr.
reed
was
the
treasurer
of
his
local.
he
discovered
that
the
general
chairman
was
obtaining
funds
that
he
was
not
entitled
to.
he
was
getting
funds
for
the
local
for
time
for
which
the
company
had
paid
him.
mr.
reed
demanded
repayment
of
this
money
from
the
general
chairman.
at
the
same
time,
during
the
same
time
period,
he
opposed
the
general
chairman's
efforts
to
get
a
dues
increase
in
the
local.
reed
went
so
far
as
to
tell
the
auditor
from
the
international
about
the
general
chairman's
double
dipping,
getting
union
funds
for
work
where
he'd
been
paid
by
the
company.
what
was
the
auditor's
response?
he
didn't
have
time
to
think
about
that
sort
of
matter.
the
auditor,
however,
then
demanded
that
reed
pay
back
funds
that
he
had
received
from
the
local,
funds
that
had
been
approved
by
the
local
after
mr.
reed
had
taken
time
from
his
job
to
perform
duties
for
his
union.
the
reason
given:
mr.
reed
had
not
received
prior
approval;
that
is,
he
had
not
gotten
their
approval
prior
to
doing
the
work.
the
problem
with
that
response?
there
had
never
been
a
prior
approval
requirement.
at
the
same
time
that
mr.
reed
was
being
required
to
repay
this
money,
one
of
the
general
chairman's
subordinates,
the
vice
general
chairman,
went
to
another
dissident
union
member,
told
him
they
could
get
him
too,
but
at
that
point,
they
were
just
after
mr.
reed.
the
vice
chairman
also
suggested
that
perhaps
this
other
union
member
might
want
to
withdraw
from
the
race
for
national
delegate
where
the
general
chairman
was
also
running.
what
did
mr.
reed
do?
he
paid
back
the
money
as
demanded.
it
was
equal
to
about
six
months
of
the
small
stipend
that
he
received
for
his
usual
duties
as
treasurer
and
he
protested
to
the
international
president,
mr.
hardin.
and
mr.
hardin
denied
the
protest.
mr.
reed
then
tried
to
apply
the
same
prior
approval
policy
to
reimbursement
requests
by
other
local
members.
he
was
chastised
by
the
international
president
and
required
to
pay
the
money
in
spite
of
the
fact
there
was
no
prior
approval.
this
discriminatory
treatment
ultimately
led
mr.
reed
to
file
this
claim,
and
the
title
i
claim,
we
argue
to
this
court,
is
not
one
which
necessitates
departure
from
the
longstanding
practice
of
this
court
in
labor
law,
as
the
court
said
in
delcostello,
as
otherwise
of
borrowing
the
appropriate
state
statute
of
limitations.
the
reason
that
there
is
no
need
for
such
a
departure
is
that
the
conditions
present
in
delcostello
are
not
present
in
this
case.
the
claim
in
delcostello
that
hybrid
duty
of
fair
representation,
section
301
claim
under
taft
hartley,
unlike
the
title
i
claim,
which
is
simply
a
straightforward
claim,
a
union
member
suing
union
for
violation
of
rights
under
title
i,
this
dfr
301
claim
directly
challenged
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
and
the
private
resolution
of
disputes
under
that
agreement
which
are
at,
as
this
court
indicated
in
delcostello,
at
the
center
of
the
labor
law
policy
passed
by
congress
in
the
nlra
and
taft
hartley.
indeed,
i
think
the
hybrid
dfr
301
action
that
was
brought
in
delcostello
is
perhaps
the
most
direct
challenge
that
can
be
made
to
that
consensual
process.
what
is
the
worker
asking
there?
he's
asking
the
federal
court
to
set
aside
the
private
dispute
resolution.
his
basis,
to
get
to
court
and
to
avoid
the
requirements
of
exhaustion
and
the
way
the
court
would
normally
look
at
the
arbitration,
what
must
he
do?
he
must
show
that
the
union
has
failed
to
properly
represent
him.
not
only
that,
he
must
show
that
the
arbitrator
made
the
wrong
decision
and,
in
fact,
he
was
entitled
to
relief.
he
has
a
very
heavy
incentive
to
sue
both,
the
union
and
the
employer,
for
otherwise
he
will
not
collect
his
full
measure
of
damages.
as
this
court
indicated
in
delcostello,
the...
it
spoke
to
its
concern
because
there
was
no
doubt
that
there
was
an
unquestioned
impact
by
the
hybrid
dfr
301
action
on
the
consensual
and
private
dispute
resolutions
process,
and
i
think
that
it
was
that
fact
that
drove
the
court
to
apply
the
exception
which
it
did
in
delcostello.
this
title
i
claim,
however,
does
not
involve
a
work
place
dispute
as
did
delcostello,
delcostello
being
that
situation
where
mr.
delcostello
had
been
terminated
from
his
job.
the
other
plaintiffs
in
delcostello
had
varying
disputes
over
the
work
place,
layoffs,
poor
job
assignments.
it
does
not
implicate
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
employer
is
not
a
party.
rather,
the
claim
is
very
straightforward.
the
union
member
asserts
that
the
union
has
violated
his
rights
under
the
union
members'
bill
of
rights,
title
i
of
the
lmrda.
this
bill
of
rights
was
promulgated
because
of
policy
considerations
present
in
neither
the
nlra
nor
the
lmrda.
congress,
at
the
time
of
the
passage
of
title
i,
had
become
aware
that
some
unions
were
acting
in
a
very
autocratic
fashion
and,
indeed,
some
unions
were
corrupt.
congress
was
casting
for
a
way
to
deal
with
these
problems.
one
would
have
been
far
more
direct
government
interference,
but
senator
mcclellan
rejected
that
approach
when
he
put
forward
the
labor
union
members'
bill
of
rights.
his
approach
was
by
granting
union
members
the
rights
of
free
speech,
of
assembly,
of
due
process,
of
participation
in
elections,
of
the
vote,
that
by
applying
the
very
model
which
had
worked
so
well
for
this
country
in
the
relationship
between
citizen
and
government
to
the
relationship
between
union
member
and
union,
that
the
democratic
process
itself
would
correct
the
abuses
which
congress
had
found.
i
think
you
can
see
how
wide
congress
sought
to
sweep
and
that
it
applied
title
i
not
just
to
unions
that
are
governed
by
the
nlra
or
unions
that
are
governed
by
the
railway
labor
act
but,
indeed,
to
all
unions,
even
the
agricultural
unions
which
are
not
subject
to
the
other
federal
labor
policies.
at
the
time
of
the
passage
of
the
lmrda,
commentators
realized
that
this
democratic
process
which
congress
sought
to
establish
was
a
fragile
one.
as
archibald
cox
recognized
in
his
article
in
the
michigan
law
review,
most
men
are
reluctant
to
risk
the
cost
incurred
in
vindicating
those
intangible
rights
that
were
set
out
in
title
i,
and
those
who
sued
under
title
i
ran,
in
mr.
cox'
words,
enormous
risk
for
they
were
going
up
against
the
power,
the
entrenched
power
of
the
union.
but
as
this
court
has
noted
in
hall
v.
cole,
the
principal
beneficiary
of
these
title
i
actions
is
not
the
individual
union
member,
it
is
the
union
membership
as
a
whole,
it
is
the
general
public
interest
that
labor
unions
in
this
country
be
run
democratically.
indeed,
as
justice
marshall
in
rejecting
a
six-months'
limitation
in
a
case
involving
similar
rights
asserted
against
the
government
noted,
these
are
the
very
claims
which
belong
in
court.
they
do
not
or
should
not
be
curtailed
by
a
short
statute
of
limitation.
secondly,
what
about
the
practicalities
of
the
litigation
because
that
again
was
a
factor
which
concerned
this
court
in
delcostello
and
again
drove
it
away
from
the
usual
practice?
i
think
the
practicalities
of
this
litigation
indicate
that
there
is
a
need
for
the
longer
state
statute
of
limitations,
the
analogous
statute
in
this
case
being
the
personal
injury
statute
in
north
carolina.
mr.
john
w.
gresham
that
is
three
years
under
[gs1-51-5.]
it
is
a
general
statute
of
limitation
for
personal
injury.
that...
that
longer
state
statute
of
limitations
is
the
more
appropriate
vehicle,
again
quoting
the
language
in
delcostello,
for
this
bit
of
interstitial
lawmaking.
as
both
archibald
cox
recognized
in
his
article
and
judge
coffen
recognized
in
his
decision
in
doty
v.
sewall
where
he
applied
the
normal
practice
and
rejected
any
exception,
there
are
good
reasons
for
a
union
member
who
has
suffered
internal
union
harassment
not
to
come
forward
immediately.
after
all,
he
still
has
his
job.
this
is
not
a
work
place
dispute.
it's
a
dispute
over
his
rights
in
the
union.
maybe
if
the
union
member
keeps
quiet,
the
problem
will
go
away,
or
maybe
someone
else
will
step
forward.
after
all,
i
think
the
union
member
must
always
keep
in
mind
those
in
power,
as
judge
coffen
indicated,
do
have
long
memories.
yet,
if
the
union
membership
as
a
whole
and
the
public
interest
is
to
be
served,
the
union
member
must
step
forward,
and
when
he
does,
what
must
he
do?
he
must
in
most
cases
find
and
pay
a
lawyer.
and
what
must
the
lawyer
do?
the
lawyer
must
investigate.
the
lawyer...
the
lawyer
must
ensure
himself
that
the
facts
are
there
sufficient
to
meet
any
challenge
under
rule
11
and
file
his
complaint.
that
is
different
from
the
situation
in
delcostello.
the
delcostello
plaintiff,
mr.
delcostello,
had
already
lost
his
job.
he
had
already
lost
his
arbitration.
he
was
casting
about
for
one
more
forum
which
might
bring
him
relief
and
might
get
him
back
his
job
and
his
wages.
additionally
i
would
note
that
there
were
practicalities
in
the
delcostello
litigation
after
the
case
was
filed.
it's
a
problem
of
the
two
different
actions
with
the
two
different
conceptual
underpinnings.
in
the
issue
of
damages,
as
this
court
has
noted,
one
collects
damages
from
the
union
only
to
the
extent
that
the
union
has
created
damages
over
and
above
the
actions
of
the
employer.
if
you
apply
the
short
statute
of
limitations
in
delcostello,
the
90-day
arbitration
period,
to
the
action
against
the
employer,
you've
truncated
the
damages.
if
you
apply
the
long
statute,
the
two-year
statute
of
limitations
that
this
court
found
was
the
most
analogous
statute
to
the...
for
the
duty
of
fair
representation
claim,
you
again
run
head
on
into
the
problems
of
the
effect
and
interference
that
that
long
statute
of
limitations
would
have
on
the
private
dispute
resolution
process
that
is
at
the
heart
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
again,
not
something
that
you
have
in
this
case.
and
the
difference,
the
difference
in
the
conceptual
underpinnings
of
these
two
statutes,
brings
me
to
a
third
point.
in
delcostello
there
was
simply
no
good
state
analogy.
the
court
thought
perhaps
after
wrestling
with
the
issue
in
mitchell,
90
days,
the
very
short
statute
of
limitations
for
arbitration
in
most
states...
some
states
had
60.
i
think
some
had
perhaps
a
bit
more...
was
not
sufficient.
it
did
not
allow
the
union
members
sufficient
time
to
come
forward
if
you
did
have
a
legitimate
grievance.
and
the
two-year
malpractice
statute
had
no...
no
connection
at
all
with
the
action
against
the
employer.
and
again,
if
it
were
implied...
if
it
were
applied,
it
would
again
cause
that
disturbance
with
the
underlying
collective
bargaining.
i
would
note
that
that
interference
is
set
forth
in
the
nlra
and
in
the
taft
hartley
act.
and
in
the
delcostello
case,
those
were
the
acts
which
gave
mr.
delcostello
his
claim,
the
act
or
the
action
inferred
against
the
union
in
this
court
and
the
duty
of
fair
representation
and
the
specific
statutory
right
under
section
301.
those
statutes
brought
forward
the
problem,
the
labor
policies
that
were
being
interfered--
xx
reach
the
issue
of
is
there
a
limitation
other
than
the
appropriate
state
statute
of
limitations
for
the
factors
i've
set
out.
but
should
the
court...
should
the
court
look
to
see
if
section
10(b)
is
analogous,
i
think
the
court
will
find
that
that
close
analogy...
clearly
a
closer
analogy
is
i
believe
the
language
of
the
court
in
setting
out
its
standards
in
delcostello...
is
not
present
here.
first
of
all,
what
did
the
court
find
with
regard
to
the
dfr
hybrid
action
and
the
unfair
labor
practice
statute
of
limitations?
they
found,
if
they
took
the
nlrb's
position,
a
complete
overlap
of
those
claims.
the
court
said,
not...
not
yet
ready
to
decide
that
point,
we
at
least
understand
that
there
is
a
substantial
overlap.
yet,
with
the
title
i
claim,
which
involves
the
internal
union
procedures
used
to
violate
the
rights
of
the
union
member,
both
the
nlrb
and
this
court
have
consistently
held
that
those
internal
union
procedures
and
that
discipline,
no
matter
what
the
motive,
is
excluded
from
the
reach
of
the
unfair
labor
practice.
as
recently
as
pattern
makers'
i
think
in
1985,
this
court
reaffirmed
that
the
union
in
its
internal
procedures
was
not
subject
to
an
unfair
labor
practice.
indeed,
the
amicus
for
the
respondent,
the
afl-cio
in
that
case,
argued
that
that
exception
reached
so
broadly
that
the
nlrb
could
not
reach
the
situation
where
the
union
tried
to
discipline
members
that
resigned.
i
would
note
that
that
position
is
entirely
opposite
from
the
one
that
the
afl-cio
takes
in
its
amicus
brief
here
today
where
they
talk
of
the
substantial
overlap
of
the
two
claims.
indeed,
i
think
a
shift
of
that
major
proportion
is
such
as
to
make
the
argument
of
the
afl-cio
what
they
term
in
their
brief
"content-free".
additionally,
the
policy
considerations
of
section
10(b),
as
this
court
noted
in
delcostello,
were
specifically
attuned
to
that
balance
which
the
court
was
trying
to
find
in
delcostello,
the
balance
between
the
worker,
the
worker
with
the
work
place
dispute,
trying
to
assert
his
claim
and
the
need
for
speedy
resolution.
the
court
found
that
that
was
what
section
10(b)
was
attuned
to
and
that
that's
what
was
at
issue
in
delcostello.
that
is
not
what
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
there
is
no
work
place
dispute.
there
is
no
dispute
over
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
there
is
no
effort
to
set
aside
that
private
resolution
of
the
dispute.
thus,
section
10(b)
is
simply
not
an
appropriate
analogy
for
this
case.
even
if
the
court
were
to
determine
that
given
the
practicalities
of
the
litigation,
given
the
federal
policies,
given
the
available
limitations,
it
had
to
look
elsewhere,
it
is
not
a
clearly
more
appropriate
statute
of
limitations.
rather,
it
is
an
action
by
a
member
of
a
private
organization
to
protect
his
federally
protected
rights
and
to
ensure
that
his
organization
functions
democratically.
delcostello
in
some
way
does
apply
to
this
case.
it
applies
in
its
directive
that
the
prior
practice
of
borrowing
state
statute
of
limitations
is
to
continue
in
labor
law
as
elsewhere
unless
the
stringent
conditions
of
delcostello
have
been
met.
they
have
not
been
met
here,
and
the
three-year
statute
of
north
carolina
is
to
apply.
i
will
reserve
my
additional
time
for
response,
if
i
may.
mr.
john
w.
gresham
i
think
the
most
important
point
that
i
would
make
on
rebuttal
is
the
great
disagreement
i
have
with
mr.
miller's
contention
with
the
question
from
justice
white
that
this
would
constitute
an
unfair
labor
practice
that
mr.
reed
could
have,
in
fact,
gone
to
the
board.
i
think
this
court's
law
and
cases...
i
think
the
very
recent
decision
of
the
third
circuit
in
nlrb
v.
local
139
which
said
that
the
8(b)(1)(a)
should
not
be
interpreted
so
literally
as
to
make
it
a
unfair
labor
practice
to
enforce
compliance
with
internal
rules
and
policy
is
precisely
what
is
at
fact
here.
the
government
in
its
brief
makes
exactly
the
same
point.
there
is
very,
very
little
overlap
between
the
title
i
claim
and
the
unfair
labor
practice
claim.
the
year
after
title
i
was
passed
in
its
25th
annual
report,
the
board
itself
said
we
don't
reach
these
disputes,
these
internal
union
matters,
even
if
there
is
a
bad
motive.
for...
for
the
union
to
now
argue
essentially,
as
i
understand
it,
that
title
i
really
wasn't
needed,
that...
that
senator
mcclellan's
bill
was
simply
to
in
somehow
reinforce
rights
that
were
already
granted,
i
think
would
make
a
mockery
of
the
legislative
history
of
title
i.
mr.
john
w.
gresham
there
are
and
i
have
been
able
to
identify
two
areas
where
the
board
has
taken
those.
one
is
where
they
beat
the
fellow
up.
the
second
is
where
they
try
to
discipline
because
he
has
gone
to
the
board
or
he
has
gone
to
the
department
of
labor
before.
they
protect
their
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
w.
gresham
they
would
be
suable
on
as
a
title
i
claim,
yes.
mr.
john
w.
gresham
that
is
correct
because
there
is
such
a
minute
overlap
between
the
two.
we
don't
have
to
reach
that
in
this
case
because
i
think
it...
it
is
clear
that
this
type
of
discipline
simply
would
not
constitute
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
any
of
this
court's
decision,
under
the
recent
third
circuit
decision,
under
the
board's
own
language.
the
proviso...
i
did
not
hear
respondent
mention
that
all
the
proviso
that
is...
that
is
included
in
8(b)(i)(a)
which
is
that
it
does
not
reach
these
mechanisms.
and
i
think
that...
that
keeps
this
from
being
an
analogy.
and
i
think
the
important
point
there
is
that
when
this
court
looked
in
delcostello
to
see
whether
10(b)
should
apply,
i
think
the
terms
this
court
used
was
"substantial
overlap".
i
would...
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
at
most
in
this
case
there
is
a
very
minimal
overlap.
i
think
as...
as...
as
the
solicitor
general
indicated
in
his
brief,
these
actions
vindicate
important
public
rights.
there
is
no
basis
for
this
court
to
depart
from
its
usual
practice.
none
of
the
problems
noted
in
delcostello
are
present
here.
there
is
no
interference,
direct
interference...
and
i
believe
again
that
is
the
language
of
this
court
in
delcostello...
with
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
therefore,
the
usual
practice
is
the
practice
that
is
available
here.
thank
you.
