material
in
this
record
then
to
file
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
would
have
had
to
do
it
in
six
months?
justice

white
and
if
he
also
sued,
you
say
they
both
should
have
been
dismissed
on
statute
of
limitations
grounds.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
he...
you
concede
he
could
have
gone
to
court
if
he
had
filed
it
on
time.
justice
byron

so,
there
wasn't
exclusive...
there
is
not
exclusive
jurisdiction.

but
if
a
union
wants
to
file
a
breach
of
duty
case
against
the
union,
it
has
to
do
so
in
six
months?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
a
union
member
wants
to
sue
a
union
for
breach
of
its
duty
of
fair
representation--
justice
byron
r.
white
--he
can
go
right
to
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
must
do
it
in
six
months?
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
you
think
there
are
some
things
that
broadly
are
matters
of
internal
union
business
that
are
unfair
labor
practices?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
and
are...
and
are
those...
are
those
suable
on
without
going
to
the
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
exactly.
and
even
in
those
circumstances
you
think
the
six
months
should
not
apply?
