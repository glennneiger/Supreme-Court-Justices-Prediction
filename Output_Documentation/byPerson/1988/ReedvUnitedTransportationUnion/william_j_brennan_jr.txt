justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
question
for
decision
is
what
statute
of
limitations
governs
a
claim
of
a
union
member
alleging
that
the
union,
in
violation
of
section
101(a)(2)
of
the
labor-management
reporting
and
disclosure
act,
denied
him
his
right
to
free
speech
as
to
union
matters.
now,
congress
did
not
enact
the
statute
of
limitations
applicable
to
such
actions
and
therefore
under
our
precedents,
we
must
decide
whether
the
governing
statute
of
limitations
is
the
6-month
period
that
applies
to
the
filing
of
charges
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
alleging
unfair
labor
practices
or
whether
as
the
district
court
here
held.
the
union
memberâ€™s
claim
is
more
a
keened
to
a
civil
rights
claim
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
provided
that
it
is
governed
by
north
carolina
statute
of
limitations
for
personal
injury
actions.
the
district
court
held
that
the
personal
injury
statute
applied,
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
held
that
the
6-month
period
applied
and
reversed
the
district
court.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
that
claims
under
section
101(a)(2)
are
governed
by
state
general
or
residual
personal
injury
statutes.
our
reasons
are
set
forth
at
length
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion,
and
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
