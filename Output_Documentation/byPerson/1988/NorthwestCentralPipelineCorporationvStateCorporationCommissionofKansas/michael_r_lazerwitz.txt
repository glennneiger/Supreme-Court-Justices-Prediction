mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
bottom
the
pipeline
here
is
complaining
about
the
state's
decision
to
rescind
its
unrestrictive
policy
towards
the
reinstatement
of
production
credits.
the
pipeline
does
not
and
cannot
challenge
the
state's
authority
to
impose
a
system
for
controlling
the
production
of
natural
gas
in
a
common
field.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
for
the
preemption
question,
which
is
the
main
focus
of
our
position,
no.
the
preemption
question
calls
for
two
separate
inquiries.
first,
is
the
state
regulating
in
an
area
where
federal
law
occupies
the
field
and
therefore
leaves
no
room
for
state
action?
and
the
second
preemption
question
is
whether
the
state
rule
conflicts
with
federal
law,
in
other
words,
whether
it
interferes
with
the
federal
regulatory
scheme.
the
natural
gas
act
itself
essentially
answers
the
first
preemption
inquiry.
the
state
has
the
right
to
control
the
production
of
natural
gas.
federal
law
simply
doesn't
occupy
the
entire
regulatory
field
at
the
production
end.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
yes,
justice
o'connor.
when
we
filed
our
first
brief,
we
were
focusing
more
on
the
question
whether
this...
the
kansas
judgment...
how
it
should
be
treated
in
the
light
of
transco.
and
the
focus
of
our
brief
was
that
it
should
be
held
and
then
sent
back
in
light
of
the
decision
in
transco.
on
further
reflection,
as
our...
the
most
recent
brief
shows,
we
have
now
focused
precisely
on
what
the
kansas
rule
raises
and
how
it
might
or
might
not
conflict
with
the
federal
regulatory
scheme.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
if
it's
taker
out
of
context,
there
is
language
in
transco
that
seems
to
be
problematic.
but
the
context
is
in
that
case
we
were
talking
about
field
preemption
where
federal
regulations
cover
the
entire
field,
that
is,
regulating
interstate
pipeline
purchasers.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
yes,
direct
regulation.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
and
this...
and
this
kansas
rule
is
far
different.
it's
controlling
production,
and
therefore
that's
why
the
first
preemption
question
is
relatively
easy.
the
second
preemption
question,
whether
the
kansas
order
conflicts
with
the
federal
regulatory
scheme,
is
somewhat
more
difficult.
but
in
our
judgment
there
is
no
conflict.
first
of
all,
the
kansas
rule
tells
producers
that
in
a
certain
situation
you
might
not
be
able
to
bark
your
production
credits.
it
doesn't
tell
the
pipeline
that
it
has
to
buy
anything.
if
the
pipeline
is
risk-averse
and
worried
that
this
gas
might
not
be
there
ten
years
down
the
road,
it
can
choose
to
buy
the
gas
now.
but
it's
not
forcing
them
to
buy
the
gas,
and
that's
a
critical
distinction
between
this
case
and
the
cases
in
northern
natural
and
transco
and
that
is
because
the
kansas
rule
by
itself
isn't
going
to
change
anything.
the
pipeline...
first
of
all,
the
producer
is
going
to
have
to
decide
whether
to
produce
more
gas
and
we
recognize
that
the
producer...
that
that
decision
whether
to
produce
more
gas
is
obviously
tied
to
a
pipeline's
decision
whether
to
purchase
more
gas.
but
the
pipeline's
decision
is
going
to
be
based
on
kansas'
rules,
other
states'
rules,
available
sources
of
other
natural
gas,
its
take-or-pay
liability.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
the
pipeline
is
fighting
this
case.
we
assume
that
the
pipeline
is
not...
does
not
want
to
purchase
more
gas,
but
that
doesn't
mean
it
will
note--
and
more
importantly,
the
producers...
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission's
policy
is
trying
to
free
up
more
gas
and
not
to
have
it
simply
sold
from
the
producers
to
the
big
interstate
pipeline.
for
example,
the
federal
commission
has
an
order
allowing
the
producers
to
try
to
get
out
of
their
contracts
with
the...
contracts
where
gas
is
dedicated
to
interstate
commerce
to
sell
it
to
someone
else
who
is
willing
to
buy
it
if
the
pipeline
with
whom
it
has
a
contract
doesn't
want
to
pay
a
certain
price.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
the
contracts
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case
or
that
are
involved
in
this
case,
these
long-term
contracts
with
the
hugoton
field,
are
those
where
the
pipeline
essentially...
they're
great
contracts
to
the
pipeline.
they
can
buy
whatever
is
produced.
on
the
other
hand,
under
the
federal
energy--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--yes,
he
can.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
he
can
seek
commission
authority
to
abandon,
in
the
sense
to
find
another
purchaser,
if
he
doesn't
want
to
sell
it
to...
for
example,
the
pipelines
are
now
not
buying
a
lot
of
the
cheap
hugoton
gas.
if
a
producer
wants
to
get
that
gas
out
of
the
ground,
perhaps
in
response
to
the
commission
rule,
the
state
commission
rule,
he
can
seek
out
new
purchasers
and
not
be
stuck
with
the
major
interstate
pipeline
that
is...
that
years
ago
was
controlling
the
flow
of
gas
from
the
field.
and
the
federal
commission's
policy
is
to
try
to
foster
that.
on
the
other
hand,
the
pipelines
themselves--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--yes,
in
the
sense
that's
what
abandonment
is,
asking
the
commission
authority
to
change
the
contract,
and
the
commission
will
take
a
look
at
that.
on
the
other
hand,
the
pipeline
has
an
out
too
under
the
commission's
rule
and
that
is
that
the
pipeline,
instead
of
buying
the
gas,
can
act
as
a
transporter
and
sell
the
gas
to
a
local
distributor.
and
in
that
situation,
the
federal
commission
will
give
credits
to
an
interstate
pipeline
who
is
willing
to
do
that.
the
federal
policy,
the
regulatory
policy
today
is
to
free
up
the
gas,
to
get
more
of
this
cheap
gas
into
the
market,
and
everyone
will
be
better
off.
on
the
point
mentioned
before
about
the
federal
commission's
approval
of
the
purchasing
practices,
there's
no
doubt
that
the
federal
commission
did
last...
over
the
summer
approve
northwest
pipeline's
purchasing
practices
for
1984
and
in
doing
so,
held...
concluded
that
it
was
prudent
to
bank
some
of
this
gas,
not
to
buy
it.
but
that
doesn't
become
a
federal
policy
approving
the
long-term
banking
of
production
credits.
that
was
a
narrow
proceeding
saying
that
this
was
prudent
at
the
time.
prudent
under
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission's
rules
means
a
rational
businessman
would
have
done
this
facing
the
situations
that
he
faced.
but
that
doesn't
at
all
mean
that
it
would
have
been
imprudent
to
buy
more
cheap
gas.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
yes.
in
that
sense
the
purpose
and
for
purposes
of
the
argument
we'll
concede...
let's
assume
there's
a
bad
purpose.
but
the
bad
purpose
would
have
to
be
encouraging
more
production
of
kansas
gas
at
the
expense
of
another
state's
gas.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
it's
not
very
strong,
but
there
is
something
in
the
sense
that
the
natural
gas
act
didn't
give
the
states
anything
and
the
idea
that
the
states
have
this
power
to
begin
with.
and
under
the
natural
gas
act,
congress
reserved
that
power
to
the
states.
so,
there
is...
and
we
do
recognize
that
there...
there
could
be
a
case
where
the
state,
for
example,
changed
the
production
rules
to
say
only
producers
for
intrastate
purchasers
can
produce
a
certain
amount
and
those
for
interstate
cannot.
that
would
pose
a
problem
under
the
commerce
clause
potentially.
but
that's
not
the
case
here.
kansas--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--no,
not
at
all.
the
kansas
supreme
court
and
the
district
court
and
the
commission...
the
point
of
the
rule
is
to
remedy
a
problem,
and
in
remedying
the
problem,
part
of
the
remedy
is
to
encourage
production
but
not
at
the
expense
of
any
other
state.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
well,
if
the
price--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--the
market
changes.
it's
not...
it's
not
to
say
that
kansas
by
encouraging
production
from
its
field
is
necessarily
going
to
hurt
any
other
field.
the
market
will
change
depending
on
price
and
the
demand.
lt's
not--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--well,
from
a
federal
standpoint,
the
kansas
gas
that's
now
sitting
in
the
ground...
we
would
like
that
gas
out
of
the
ground.
it's
the
cheapest
gas
around.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
no.
as
i
understand
the...
the
field,
it's
too
expensive.
thank
you.
