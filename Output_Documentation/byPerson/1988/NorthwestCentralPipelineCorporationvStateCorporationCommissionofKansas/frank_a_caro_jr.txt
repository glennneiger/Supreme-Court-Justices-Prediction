mr.
frank
a.
caro,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
purpose
of
my
argument
is
to
show
that
the
kansas
corporation
commission's
order
amending
paragraph
p
of
the
basic
proration
order
for
the
kansas
hugoton
field
was
an
exercise
of
the
state's
legitimate
interest
to
conserve
its
natural
resources
by
preventing
waste
from
occurring
in
the
field
and
in
protecting
correlative
rights
of
adjoining
leaseholders
in
that
field.
second,
the
action
of
the
kansas
commission...
the
action
the
kansas
commission
took
fits
squarely
within
the
production
and
gathering
exemption
of
the
natural
gas
act.
and
finally,
the
effect
of
the
kansas
commission's
order
does
not
interfere
with
the
comprehensive
federal
regulatory
scheme,
nor
does
it
unconstitutionally
burden
interstate
commerce.
the
problem
in
the
field,
in
the
kansas
hugoton
field,
was
that
the
field
was
out
of
balance.
pressures
in
the
kansas
hugoton
field
indicated
that
gas
was
draining
from
a
non-producing
well
to
the
producing
well.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
when
a
well
is
not
producing
or
is
shut
in,
pressures
accumulate
in
that
well.
gas
migrates
in
the
field...
in
a
common
source
of
supply
in
this
field,
in
the
kansas
hugoton
field,
from
a
high
pressure
zone
to
a
low
pressure
zone,
the
low
pressure
zone
being
the
area
in
which
the
well
is
timely
producing
its
allowables.
that's
what
was
happening
here
in
the
kansas...
in
the
kansas
hugoton
field.
the
field
was
being
used
as
a
storage
facility.
some
producers
were
not
timely
producing
their
production
allowable,
and
by
not
timely
producing
that
production
allowable,
it
was
causing
the
drainage
of
that
gas
from
the
high
pressure
area,
from
the
shut-in
well
area,
to
the
low
pressure
area
which
was
violating
correlative
rights
and
causing
waste
to
occur
in
the
field.
the
commission--
mr.
frank
a.
caro,
jr.
--because...
because
of
the
commission's
decisions
or
the
commission's
action
prior
to
the
amendment
of
paragraph
p,
it
gave
these
producers
the
right
to
bank
these
allowables
or
to
bank
these
non...
these
non-procuced
allowables
or
these
underages
indefinitely.
these...
the
producers
in
the
field
thought
that
they
could
accumulate
these
unproduced
allowables
and
at
a
later
date
come
in
and
produce
them.
mr.
frank
a.
caro,
jr.
justice--
mr.
frank
a.
caro,
jr.
--no.
no,
we
don't.
i
think...
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
that
what
the
kansas
commission
did
was
encourage
the
timely
production
of
those
allowables
because
only
through
timely
producing
those
allowables...
producing
those
allowables
pursuant
to
the
proration
order...
in
other
words,
making
sure
that
each
well
produces
its
fair
snare
of
the
gas
in
conjunction
with
other
wells
that
are
producing
in
the
field.
and
it's
only...
when
you...
when
you
let
them
do
that,
when
those
wells
produce
in
a
timely
manner,
when...
when
you
encourage
the
timely
production
of
those
allowables
does
the
field
become
back...
get
back
into
balance.
and
when
the
field
is
back
into--
mr.
frank
a.
caro,
jr.
--well--
mr.
frank
a.
caro,
jr.
--that's
not...
that's...
i
know
i'm
not
answering
your
question.
mr.
frank
a.
caro,
jr.
this
is
not--
mr.
frank
a.
caro,
jr.
--i
think
we
lose
in
that
case.
the
problem
is
that
that's
not
what
happened
here.
mr.
frank
a.
caro,
jr.
we
have
to
look--
mr.
frank
a.
caro,
jr.
--what
we
need
to
look
at
is
the
reason
why
kansas
is...
is
doing
what
it's
doing.
mr.
frank
a.
caro,
jr.
the
purpose...
we
need
to
look
at
why--
mr.
frank
a.
caro,
jr.
--mr.
chief
justice,
because
i
think
if...
we're
not
forcing
more
kansas
gas
on...
on
the
interstate
markets.
that...
we're
encouraging
the
production,
the
timely
production,
of
those
allowables.
yes,
more
gas
is
going...
may
go
to
the
interstate
markets.
more
gas
may
be
produced
in
kansas.
and
it
may
go
into
the
interstate
markets
as
a
result
of
the
kansas
commission's
order.
but
this
order
does
not
force
the
pipelines
to
take
more
gas.
it
does
not
force
the
appellants
to
take
more
gas
out
of
the
field.
it
merely
encourages
the
timely
production.
and
that...
and
it
only
does
that
to
bring
the
field
back
into
balance.
we
saw
that
waste
was
occurring.
waste
was
occurring
in
the
field,
that...
that
uncompensated
drainage
from
the
non-producing
wells
to
the
producing
wells
was
occurring.
and
by
giving
them
an
incentive...
by
giving
a
producer
an
incentive
to
timely
produce
that
gas,
to
timely
produce
the
allowable
that's
assigned
to
them
do
we...
do
we
bring
the
field
back
into
balance
in
the
long
run.
and
that's
the...
that's
the
purpose
of
the
commission's
order.
mr.
frank
a.
caro,
jr.
the
purpose
of
the
kansas
commission's
order?
mr.
frank
a.
caro,
jr.
no.
i
think
if
you
look
at
what
mr....
what
the
appellant
is
saying
is
that
it's
not...
it's
not
true.
we're
not
forcing...
we're
not...
the
reason
we're
forcing
more
kansas
gas
to
be
produced,
the
reason
we're
encouraging
timely
production
of
that
allowable
is
to
bring
the
field
back
into
balance,
to
conserve
the
natural
resources
in
the
field,
to
protect
correlative
rights
and
prevent
waste
from
occurring.
that's
what
the
problem
was.
the
commission
in
its
expertise
found
that
to
be
the
problem
that
was
occurring
in
the
field.
as
i
said--
mr.
frank
a.
caro,
jr.
--i
don't
believe
they
said
it
was
to
increase
kansas'
share
of
interstate
gas.
what
they
said
is
that...
to
increase
the
production
of
gas
from
the
kansas
hugoton
field,
and
that
it
was
the
purpose
to
encourage
the
timely
production
of
that
gas
because
by...
by
these
producers
not
producing,
by
the
pipelines
not
taking
the
gas
in
the
field,
it
was
causing
a
problem.
and
the
commission
had
to
address
that
problem.
if
we
didn't
address
the
problem,
the
field
would
become
out
of
balance,
waste
would
occur
and,
therefore,
we
wouldn't
be
conserving
our...
the
natural
resources
in
the
field.
the
second
thing
to
look
at
is
this
order
is
no
different
that
any...
than
what
any
other
state
does.
the
two
largest
states
in
the...
the
two
largest
natural
gas
producing
states
in
the
country--
mr.
frank
a.
caro,
jr.
--northwest
central
is
a
interstate
pipeline.
mr.
frank
a.
caro,
jr.
it
buys
from
producers
in
the...
in
the
field.
mr.
frank
a.
caro,
jr.
it
complains
because
it...
it
says
that
this
rule
is
going
to
have
an
effect
on
them.
it's
going
to
affect
the
price
that
they
ultimately
charge
for
their
gas
because
they
believe
that
they're
going
to
have
to
take
less
from...
take
less
of
these
high
take-or-pay
contracts,
these
private
contractual
agreements
that
they've
entered
into
that
the
state...
that
they
believe
the
state
ought
to
consider
when
it...
when
it
wants
to
adjust
the
allowable
formula
in
the
field.
mr.
frank
a.
caro,
jr.
the
order
of
the
ferc?
mr.
frank
a.
caro,
jr.
the
order
of
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
has
no
impact
on
this
case.
what...
what
ferc
does
is
to
look
at
whether
the
purchasing
practices
of...
of
the
appellant
were
prudent
in
light
of
the...
in
light
of
the
state
regulatory
scheme,
in
light
of...
in
light
of
all
of
the
situations
faced...
facing
that
pipeline.
i
think
that
if
this
court
upholds
this
decision,
it's
not
going
to
affect
what...
how
ferc
looks
at
it.
ferc's
own
brief
indicates
that.
mr.
frank
a.
caro,
jr.
yes,
it
can,
justice.
i
believe
that
order
came
out
in
late
1988.
the
commission's...
the
kansas
commission's
order
took
effect
in
1983.
mr.
frank
a.
caro,
jr.
so,
i
believe
it
may
have
even...
it
may
even
consider
the...
the
state
regulatory
scheme
in
effect
in
kansas
just
like
it
also
considers
the
state
regulatory
schemes
in
effect
in
oklahoma,
in
texas
and
other
states--
mr.
frank
a.
caro,
jr.
--they
have...
they
have
had
to
comply.
mr.
frank
a.
caro,
jr.
no,
this
order
has
not
been
stayed.
it
has
been
moved
back...
the
implementation
of
it.
what
the
order
did...
it
said
that--
mr.
frank
a.
caro,
jr.
--to
i
believe
1986.
the...
the...
the
producers
in
the
field
had
different
periods
of
time
in
which
unproduced
allowables
were
cancelled
off,
permanently
cancelled.
one
period
of
time
was
pre-1975.
well,
those
unproduced
allowables,
if
not
reinstated,
are...
have
been
cancelled.
the
period
of
time
from
1975
through
1986
is
still
in
place,
and
the...
and
the
producers
have
until
december
31,
1989
to...
to
petition
the
commission
to
reinstate
those
cancelled
underages,
those
past
11
years
of
cancelled
underages,
and
then
have...
and
then
once
reinstated,
they
have
60
months
to
produce
it.
the
commission
in
its
order
is
not
permanently
cancelling
underages.
what
we're
doing
is
tightening
the
production
tolerances
in
the
field.
mr.
frank
a.
caro,
jr.
i
don't
understand
the
question.
mr.
frank
a.
caro,
jr.
that's
all
that...
that's
all
you
have
to
do
to
reinstate...
to
reinstate
is
show
that
you
have
an
accumulation
of
cancelled
underage--
mr.
frank
a.
caro,
jr.
--that
you
want
to
have
it
reinstated,
and--
mr.
frank
a.
caro,
jr.
--and
that's
it.
mr.
frank
a.
caro,
jr.
you
mean
there's
no
prohibition...
you
mean
what--
mr.
frank
a.
caro,
jr.
--that's
correct.
mr.
frank
a.
caro,
jr.
no.
underages
can
be
accumulated.
cancelled
underages
under
the...
under
the
commission's
order
can
be
accumulated
for
three
years.
once
they've
been
accumulated
to
that
three-year
period,
they
have
three
years
to
reinstate
those
cancelled
underages.
once
reinstated,
for
whatever
reasons,
because
they
say
that
they
can...
because
the
producer
thinks
that
they
can
produce
them,
they
have
60
months
to
produce
those.
so,
you
have
an
eight-year
period
here.
clearly
reasonable
to
contemplate
any
market
trends
that
may
be
in
effect.
what
the
commission's
order
did
prior
to
the
amendment--
mr.
frank
a.
caro,
jr.
--the
commission
will
reinstate
those
underages
as
long
as--
mr.
frank
a.
caro,
jr.
--automatically
as
long
as
they
have
not
been...
as
long
as
it's
not
longer
than
a
three-year
period
under
the
commission's
amendment.
so,
you
can
carry
those
cancelled
underages
for
three
years.
if
you
don't
reinstate
them--
mr.
frank
a.
caro,
jr.
--they're
permanently
cancelled.
now,
once
they're
cancelled,
once
they're
permanently
cancelled,
doesn't...
doesn't...
i
don't
fact
you
to
be...
i
don't
want
you
to
misunderstand
that
they
don't
have
a
right
to
produce
further
reserves
in
the
field.
they're
assigned...
they're
constantly
assigned
a
new
allowable
formula,
a
new
allowable
that
they
can
produce
in
the
field.
that
allowable
takes
into
consideration
the
fact
that
they
may
not
have
been
producing
because
of
the
allowable...
because
the
allowable
formula
is
made
up
of
three
factors.
it's
made
up
of
acreage,
which
is
the
spacing
unit,
which
in
the
hugoton
field
is
640
acres
equals
one
unit.
it
takes
into
the
second
factor
which
is
well
pressure
or
deliverability.
and
if
you
recall,
well
pressure
is
going
to
be
higher
if
your
well
has
not
been
producing.
therefore,
you're
going
to
get
a
higher
allowable
assignment
in
the
field.
and
the
third
factor
is
market
demand
which
is
set
by
the
commission
based
on
the
nominations
of
the
producers
and
purchasers
of
what
they...
what
they
anticipate
to
use
in
the...
in
the
upcoming
six-month
period.
so,
they're
not
being...
they're
not
being
they're
not...
they
are...
they
do
have
a
chance
to
produce
that...
that...
those
reserves
in
the
field.
what
we're
doing
is...
is
merely
asking
them
to...
we're
encouraging
the
producer
to
timely
produce
those
reserves
in
the
field
to
prevent
the
waste
that
the
commission
found
in
its
expertise
was
occurring
in
the
field,
to
balance
off
the
field,
to
balance
off
the
pressures
in
the
field.
this
case
is
distinguishable
from
northern.
the
reason
this
case
is
distinguishable
from
northern
is
because
in
northern,
the
northern
decision
or
the
action
the
commission
took
or
the
orders
taken
in
northern
were
directed
at
purchasers.
it
ordered
the
pipelines
to
take
gas
rateably
in
the
field.
in
our
decision
the
commission
is
not
ordering
the
pipelines
to
do
anything.
the
pipeline
doesn't
have
to...
doesn't
have
to
buy
more
kansas
gas
if
the
pipeline
doesn't
want
to.
if
in
the
pipeline's
discretion
it
decides
that
it
doesn't...
that
it
wants
to
take
that...
that
high
take-or-pay
those
high
take-or-pay
gas
that
it
has
contracted
on
its
own
to
take,
it
can
take
it.
and
if
it
does,
does
it
lose
its
rights
to
the
reserves
in
the
field?
clearly
not
because
a
new
allowable,
even
if
their...
even
if
their
underages
are
cancelled,
a
new
allowable
is
assigned.
the
commission's
order
is
reasonable
in
light
of
northern.
the
effect
of
the
order
is
reasonable.
it's
not
going...
you
know,
the
effect
of
this
order
is
incidental
on
the
pipeline's
purchasing
practices.
it
becomes
merely
a
consideration
to
have
to
take,
merely
a
consideration
that
the
pipeline
has
to
make
when
it's
purchasing
gas,
just
like
it
makes
a
consideration
on
whether
to
buy
gas
from
wyoming,
oklahoma,
texas
or
any
other
state,
just
like
it
makes
a
decision
to
buy
more
take-or-pay
gas
or
less
take-or-pay
gas.
it
becomes
merely
a
consideration
and
the
effect
is
incidental.
the
effect
of
this
decision
could
impact...
as
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
council
on
state
and
local
government
indicates,
17
states
across
the
country
have
similar
law,
have
laws
similar
to
kansas
that
regulate
the
proration
in
the
field.
proration
in
the
field
means
that
gas...
that
each
well
is
producing
its
fair
share
in
proportion
to
other
wells'
production
in
the
field.
so,
the
impact
of
this
decision
means
a
lot
to
about
17
states
that
produce
natural
gas
in
the
field.
every
state
has
some
form
of
proration,
some
form
of
an
assignment
of
an
allowable
to
the
field
to
assure
that
that
state
conserves
its
natural
resources
by
the
orderly
production
of
natural
gas
in
the
field.
therefore,
i
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
kansas
supreme
court's
decision
upholding
the
kansas
commission
order.
this
would
conclude
my
argument.
i'd
like
to
entertain
any
questions
if
there
are
any.
mr.
frank
a.
caro,
jr.
thank
you.
