unknown
speaker
mr.
talisman,
excuse
me.
could
i
ask
a
question
at
this
point?
unknown
speaker
you
say
the
purpose
is
to
give
each
producer
his
fair
share
of
the--
unknown
speaker
--of
the
common
pool
of
gas.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
couldn't
fairness
be
decided
on
a...
on
a
first-take/first...
first
win
rule,
whoever
captures
the
gas
is
entitled
to
it,
which
is
the
way
some
other
natural
resources
are
by
some
states
treated?
why
can't
kansas
say
the
fair
rule
is
if
you're
all
tapped
into
the
same
pool
of
gas,
whoever
takes
it
out
gets
it?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
they've
changed
their
mind,
and
they're
going
closer
back
to
a
rule
of
capture.
would
the
rule
of
capture
violate
in
and
of
itself
the
natural
gas
act?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that,
but
before
we
get
to
whether
the
purpose
invalidates
it,
i'm
trying
to...
trying
to
establish
whether
you
assert
that
the
mere
fact
of
the
rule
that
they
have,
regardless
of
its
purpose,
invalidates
it.
i
don't
see
how
their
rule
is
any
worse
than
a
rule
of
capture.
you
acknowledge
a
rule
of
capture
would
be
all
right,
in
and
of
itself--
unknown
speaker
--not...
not
looking
to
its
purpose.
unknown
speaker
let's
leave
that
for
the
moment.
unknown
speaker
would
a
rule
of
capture
be
all
right?
unknown
speaker
apart
from
purpose.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
now...
now,
is
this
any
worse
than
a
rule
of
capture?
surely
it's
no
worse.
unknown
speaker
how
is
it
worse?
it
seems
to
me
that--
unknown
speaker
--all
this
rule
says
is
that
whatever
you
take
out...
if
somebody
else
takes
out
more
this
year
than
you
do--
unknown
speaker
--you
won't
be
able
to
make
up
that
next
year.
that's
all.
that's
all
it
says,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
there
would
be
if
somebody
took
out
the
entire...
the
entire
pool
this
year,
wouldn't
there?
there
would
be
nothing
left.
unknown
speaker
whereas
in
this
case,
they
can't
take
everything
out.
there
is
some
limit
set,
and
the
only
difference
is
if
you
don't
take
out
that
amount
this
year,
you
won't
have
a
right
to
make
it
up
next
year.
i
don't
see
how
that's
any
worse
than
a
rule
of
capture.
unknown
speaker
xxx.
unknown
speaker
mr.
talisman?
unknown
speaker
mr.
talisman,
don't
all
state
regulations
such
as
numbers
and
spacing
of
wells
and
otter
safety
regulations
also
affect
in
a
sense
the
interstate
mix
of
gas?
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
no
doubt
they
do.
unknown
speaker
it
just
seems
to
me
allowables
are...
are
more
on
the
order
of
that
kind
of
traditional
state
regulation.
unknown
speaker
well,
don't
you
think--
unknown
speaker
--we
have
to
look
at
what
congress
intended?
unknown
speaker
don't
we
have
to--
unknown
speaker
--determine--
unknown
speaker
--whether
congress
intended
to
allow
the
states
to
take
this
role?
unknown
speaker
and
under
silkwood,
pervasive
regulation
alone
doesn't
tell
us
that.
unknown
speaker
and
we
do
have
some
indications
that
congress
did,
indeed,
intend
states
to
have
some
role
in
regulating
the
production
of
gas.
unknown
speaker
do
other
states
have--
unknown
speaker
--similar
regulations
that
require
gas
to
be
taken
or
lost?
unknown
speaker
xxx.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
don't
argue
for
a
rule
of
capture.
unknown
speaker
and
you
don't
argue
against
the
old
allowable
system.
unknown
speaker
you
argue
against
the
new
allowable
system
because
in
part
it's
inconsistent
with
your
take-or-pay
provisions
in
other
states.
unknown
speaker
you
don't...
you
don't
say
it
has
no
relation
to
conservation
purposes,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
it
has
no
relation
to
conservation--
unknown
speaker
--purposes
at
all.
unknown
speaker
cannot...
cannot--
unknown
speaker
--that's...
that's
given
this
market.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it...
i
take
it
if
the
price
of
gas
radically
escalated,
that
the
case
would
be
different,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
a
much
different
case.
unknown
speaker
so,
then
kansas...
so,
then
kansas
has
to
change
its
scheme
every
time
the
interstate
market
changes.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
quite
understand
your
overriding
principle.
if
you
said
that
kansas
simply
has
no
jurisdiction
to
do
this
and
it
has
to
be
a
law
of
capture
and
the
federal
government
has
to
regulate
it,
fine.
but
you
want
a
very
precise
kind
of
regulation
that
benefits
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
i...
i
would
think
that
you
would
make
the
same
argument
if
a
state
which
has
the
rule
of
capture,
if
any
of
them
does,
suddenly
changed
to
a...
a
proration,
an
allowable
system,
because
then
you
are...
you
are
just
invalidating
the
rule
of
captured.
and
surely
your
so-called
mix
would
change
when
you
shifted
from
capture
to
proration.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
possibly--
unknown
speaker
--accept
just
an
ordinary
proration
order
then.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
know
but...
but
you
could
make
the
same
argument
there
that
the
purpose
of
the
state
was
to...
was
to
prevent
the
producers
from
producing
from
oklahoma
in
the
hugoton
field
instead
of
kansas.
unknown
speaker
and
i
don't
see--
unknown
speaker
--and
i
would...
i
would...
i
would
think
that
kansas
wouldn't
be
prevented
from
having
a
proration
system
from
the
outset
where
no
underages
would
accumulate.
they
just...
if
you
didn't
produce
your...
your
allowable,
that's
just
too
bad.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
don't
say
that's
unconstitutional,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
but
it
was
still--
unknown
speaker
--it
was
still
a
regulation
of
production.
it
has
just
had
this
consequence
on--
unknown
speaker
--no.
anytime
you
regulate
production,
you're
going
to
have
an
impact
on--
unknown
speaker
--well,
what
is
your
preemption?
is
it
that
it
interferes
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
energy
commission?
unknown
speaker
or
is
it
just
that
there's
such
a
pervasive
federal
regulation
that
the
states
just
can't
do
anything
that
has
an
effect
on
the
price
of
gas
or
that...
or
the...
or
the
purchasing
practices
of
the
pipelines?
unknown
speaker
xxx.
unknown
speaker
under
your
view
what's
left
of
the
reservation
of
the
authority
in
the
act
that
says
the
states
can
regulate
the
production
in
gathering?
unknown
speaker
but
anything...
anything
directed
by
its
terms
to
regulate
production
or
gathering
is
bad
if
there's
an
attempt
to...
to
influence
the
purchasers?
unknown
speaker
so,
then
you--
unknown
speaker
--so,
then
you
take
the
position
that
the
state
must
take
interstate
commerce
and
interstate
markets
into
account.
unknown
speaker
which
is
precisely
the
opposite
of
what
i
thought
our
commerce
clause
cases--
unknown
speaker
--well,
has
that
got
any
impact
on
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
mean...
but
is...
is
that
company
that
you
mentioned...
is
that
a
party
here?
unknown
speaker
that's
your
company.
unknown
speaker
but
then
is
it
your
argument
now
simply
that
this...
this
kansas
system
is
invalid
as
applied?
unknown
speaker
you're
saying...
your
argument--
unknown
speaker
--is
that
it's
just
plain
invalid.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
quite
a
different
argument.
you're
saying
now
that
it's
inconsistent
with
a
energy
commission
order.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--the
commission
doesn't--
unknown
speaker
--the
commission
doesn't
seem
to
think
that...
that
this
system
is
inconsistent
with
any
orders
of
it.
unknown
speaker
does
it?
does
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
yes,
but...
but
i
would--
unknown
speaker
--i
would
think
they
know...
they
would
know
better
than
we
would
whether...
whether
the
order...
the
prudent...
the
order
that
you
mentioned
as
being
prudent
that
says
your
practices
were
prudent...
they
would
know
whether
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
kansas
system.
they
say
it
isn't.
unknown
speaker
that
order...
that
order
was
entered
after
you
filed
your
initial
brief?
unknown
speaker
in
your
reply
brief.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
talisman.
mr.
caro,
we'll
hear
from
you
now.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
that.
why
isn't
that
its
own
punishment?
if
you
don't
produced,
the
gas
goes
away
from
your
well,
why
does
the
state
have
to...
i
mean,
that's
its
own
punishment.
why
isn't
that
alone
enough
to
induce
somebody
to
produce?
unknown
speaker
what
if
i
don't
believe
all
that,
mr.
caro?
what
if
i
think
kansas
really
did
this
just
to
get
more
gas
produced
in
kansas--
unknown
speaker
--and
make
more
money
for
kansans?
suppose
i
think
that
was
the
whole
purpose
of
this?
do
you
lose?
you
concede
that
you
lose?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose...
suppose
your
statute
said
in
order
to
ensure
that
kansas
has
a
greater
share
of
the
interstate
market,
the
following
rule
is
enacted.
it's
the
same
as
justice
scalla's
question.
suppose
we
find
that
the
purpose
is
to
favor
kansas
producers
and
kansas
consumers.
then
what?
unknown
speaker
do
you
automatically
lose?
unknown
speaker
i
know
it's
not
that
case.
unknown
speaker
but
it
tests
the
legal
proposition
which
is
what
we're
here
for.
do
you
lose
in
that
case?
unknown
speaker
even
though
the--
unknown
speaker
--even
though
the
statute
says
that
you
can
regulate
production?
unknown
speaker
what
you're
saying
is
that
that's
not
the
purpose.
unknown
speaker
why...
why
do
you
need
to
look
at
the
purpose
when
the
statute
says
you
can
regulate
production
and
gathering?
unknown
speaker
do
we
look
to
the
legislative
history?
i
mean
it
you
say
purpose
is
crucial,
i
suppose
we
have
to
look
to
the
legislative
history.
and
it
really
comes
down
to
whether
we
believe
mr.
talisman
or
whether
we
believe
you
as
to
what
the
purpose
was.
right?
unknown
speaker
right,
right.
we
sort
of
sit
as
a
jury
to
decide
what
the
purpose
was,
and
if
we...
if
we
agree
with
mr.
talisman,
then
you
lose.
unknown
speaker
one...
one
more
point.
do
you
agree
with
the
characterization
of
the
petitioners
of
the
appellants
that
the
kansas
supreme
court
held
that
the
purpose
of
this
regulation
was
to
increase
kansas'
share
of
interstate
gas?
unknown
speaker
is
northwest
a
producer?
unknown
speaker
and
it...
it
just
buys
from
producers.
unknown
speaker
and...
and
so
it
complains
because
this
rule
has
an
effect
on
it.
unknown
speaker
what
is
your...
if
you'd
tell
me.
do
you
think
that
this...
this
order
of
the
commission
that
was
entered
after
the
filing
of
the
initial
brief
here...
do
you
think
that
order
has
any
impact
on
this
case?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
of
the
federal...
the
energy
commission.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
purchasing
practice,
though,
that
ferc
said
was...
was
prudent...
can
it
any
longer
be
followed
in
light
of
the
kansas
scheme?
unknown
speaker
i
know.
unknown
speaker
so,
the
producers
have
had
to
comply
with...
with
this
1983
order
all
these
years?
unknown
speaker
or
was
it...
or
was
it
stayed?
unknown
speaker
moved
back
to
when?
unknown
speaker
do
we...
do
we
know
what
the
standard
is
for
the
commission's
agreeing
to
reinstate
them?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean,
i...
i
asked
the
commission
to
reinstate
them.
what
are
the
criteria
on
the
basis
of
which
the
commission
determines
that?
whether
what?
it's
a
tuesday?
or
what
is...
is
there
any
standard
at
all?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
and
that's
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
there
is
really
no
prohibition
at
all
you're
saying.
is
that
the
commitment
kansas
is
going
to
make
here
now,
that
there--
unknown
speaker
--so
long
as
you
want
to
get
your
cancelled
underages,
you
can
get
them.
unknown
speaker
you
have
an
entitlement
to
get
them
even
though
they've
been
cancelled.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
must
say
i
didn't
understand
that
reinstatement
was
a
matter
of
right.
you're
saying
you
have
a
right
to
get
them
reinstated
so
long
as
you
say
i
want
them
reinstated.
unknown
speaker
automatically.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
thank
your,
mr.
caro.
unknown
speaker
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
lazerwitz.
unknown
speaker
mr.
lazerwitz,
does
the
purpose
of
kansas
regulation
make
any
difference
in
our
analysis?
unknown
speaker
now,
that
was
not...
the
sg
has
taken
a
different
position
now
than
when
the
case
was
here
before.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
the
court
went
a
little
too
far
in
transco
in
some
of
its
language?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
system
like
northern
natural
was
directed
at
pipelines.
unknown
speaker
directly,--
unknown
speaker
--well,
given
take-or-pay
liability
that
exists
and
the
price
of
new
gas
versus
old
gas,
it's
fairly
obvious
that
the
pipeline
is
not
going
to
purchase
any
more
gas,
isn't
it,
in
the
existing
market?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lazerwitz,
i
don't
understand
what
you're...
what
you're
describing
to
me.
as
i
understand
these
pipeline
contracts,
they
are
long-term
contracts
like...
it
almost
amounts
to
the
pipeline
purchasing
the
pool
of
gas,
doesn't
it?
i
mean,
it
has
a
right
to
take
a
certain
amount
from
the...
from
the
well
over...
over
the
next
12
years
or
whatever.
unknown
speaker
and
the...
and
the
producer,
if
he
takes
it
out,
has
to
give
it
to
the
pipeline.
he
can't
give
it
to
somebody
else,
can
he?
unknown
speaker
can
he?
unknown
speaker
breaking
his
contract.
he
would
be
breaking
his
contract
with
the
pipelines,
right,
even
though--
unknown
speaker
--at
the
very
outset
justice
o'connor
asked
you
if
purpose
were
relevent,
and
you
said
not
the
preemption
prong
of
the
argument.
is
it
relevant
to
the
claim
that
interstate
commerce
is
being
regulated
in
an
impermissible
manner?
unknown
speaker
how
strong
is
a
negative
commerce
clause
argument
here
where
congress
has
said
the
state
shall
have
authority
to
regulate
production
and
gathering?
unknown
speaker
do
you
read
the
kansas
supreme
court
opinion
as
holding
that
there
is
a
purpose
to
regulate
interstate
commerce
that's
impermissible?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lazerwitz,
i
really
think
you're...
you're
drawing
a
line
that
doesn't
exist
when
you
say
if
their
purpose
was
only
to
increase
production
of
kansas
gas
at
the
expense
of
gas
from
other
states.
i
mean,
we're
in
the
real
world
here.
every
time
you
produce
more
gas
from
kansas,
you're
going
to
produce
less
gas.
is
there
an
infinitely
expandable
market
for
gas?
unknown
speaker
there's
not
a
limited
market
up...
cut
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
the
people
in
the
business
would
be
surprised
to
learn
that,
that
the
more
gas
you
produce
from
kansas,
the
less
gas
you
won't
be
producing
from
somewhere
else.
i
find
that
rather
surprising.
unknown
speaker
fine,--
--mr.
lazerwitz,
is
there
any
practical
means
to
store
natural
gas
once
it's
taken
out
of
the
ground?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
lazerwitz.
mr.
tallsman,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
have
to
spend
a
whole
lot
of
time
to
persuade
me
or
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
sounds
like
there's
a
lot
of
flexibility
in
the
kansas
plan
that
you
don't
really
lose
it,
and
even
if
you
supposedly
lose
it,
you
can
have
it
reinstated
and
so
on.
