mr.
harold
l.
talisman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
another
case
involving
a
regulation
of
the
kansas
corporation
commission
which
is
designed
to
alter
the
purchasing
practices
of
interstate
natural
gas
pipelines
that
are
regulated
under
the
natural
gas
act.
i
say
it's
another
case
because
on
two
prior
occasions,
in
1958
in
cities
service
gas
company
versus
the
kansas
corporation
commission
and
in
1963
in
northern
natural
gas
company
versus
the
kansas
corporation
commission,
this
court
held
invalid
kansas
corporation
commission
regulations
which
intruded
on
federal
regulation
under
the
natural
gas
act.
there
as
here
the
kansas
corporation
commission
contended
that
those
regulations
were
necessary
for
it
to
carry
out
its
functions
in
the
regulation
of
production
from
kansas
fields.
in
northern
natural
gas
company,
this
court
squarely
held
that
the
kansas
corporation
commission
could
not
either
directly
or
indirectly
intrude
on
federal
regulation
of
purchasing
practices
of
interstate
pipeline
companies.
and
it
therefore
held
that
a
kansas
regulation
which
had
directed
a
pipeline
company
to
take
gas
in
a
certain
manner
in
that
field
to
be
invalid
under
the
supremacy
clause.
more
recently,
in
1986
in
transcontinental,
this
court
upheld
and
it
reaffirmed
the
northern
natural
decision
although
the
gas
in
that
case
was
federally
deregulated.
since
the
gas
in
this
case
is
old
gas,
gas
that
remains
subject
to
federal
regulation,
it's
our
view
that
this
case
falls
squarely
within
the
confines
of
the
northern
natural
decision
and
a
fortiori,
transcontinental.
now,
the
kansas
commission
contends
they
have...
that
they
have
circumvented
this
court's
prohibitions
in
northern
natural
and
in
the
transco
case
because
the
regulation
in
this
case
is
nominally
addressed
to
producers.
but
the
record
shows
clearly
that
the
purpose
and
effect
of
the
regulation
is
to
alter
the
purchasing
practices
of
interstate
pipelines.
indeed,
it
was
justified
on
the
basis
that
it
would
cause
interstate
pipelines
to
buy
more
kansas
gas
at
the
expense
of
gas
from
other
sources
outside
of
kansas
on
pain
of
suffering
an
economic
penalty.
it's
for
this
reason
that
we
contend
that
the
regulation
in
this
case
is
the
same
type
of
case
that
we
had
in
northern
natural,
but
it's
in
sheep's
clothing.
with
that
brief
introduction,
let
me
outline
the
facts.
the
regulation
that
we're
talking
about
in
this
case
applies
to
the
kansas
hugoton
field.
it
is
one
of
the
largest,
if
not
the
largest,
gas
field
and
one
of
the
old
gas
fields
in
the
united
states.
northwest
central
is
one
of
several
interstate
pipeline
companies
that
purchased
gas
from
the
kansas
hugoton
field
under
long-term
contracts.
the
natural
gas
pipeline
companies
that
purchase
gas
in
this
field
have
invested
hundreds
of
millions
of
collars
in
pipeline
facilities
to
take
gas
in
the
field.
and
those
facilities
were
authorized
by
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
upon
a
showing
that
there
would
be
sufficient
reserves
to
support
the
investments
that
were
made.
the
gas
which
northwest
central
and
other
pipelines
take
in
this
field
is
commingled
with
gas
which
they
take
from
other
sources
in
other
states.
this
gas
is
transported
and
sold
in
interstate
commerce
to
retail...
to
distributors
that
resell
the
gas
for
ultimate
consumption
for
residential,
commercial
and
industrial
use.
the
rates
that
are
charged
by
northwest
central
and
other
pipelines
are
regulated
by
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
under
the
natural
gas
act
on
a
cost-of-service
basis.
and
the
cost
to
purchase
gas
is
probably
the...
no
doubt
the
largest
item
in
the
cost
of
service,
and
the
mix
of
gas
affects
that
cost.
and,
therefore,
the
cost
to
purchase
gas
is
subject
to
very,
very
close
scrutiny
by
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
including
prudency
reviews
as
to
the
mix
of
gas
being
used.
now,
the
kansas
commission
has
authority
to
regulate
production
in
kansas.
under
kansas
law,
the
objective
is
for
the
regulation
to
provide
that
each
owner
in
a
common
pool
will
get
its
fair
share
of
the
gas
in
place.
so,
the
purpose
of
the
law
is
not
to
promote
kansas
gas,
but
rather
to
provide
a
basis
upon...
in
which
each
producer
will
get
his
share
of
the
gas.
in
doing
that,
kansas
establishes
allowables
for
each
well
on
a
monthly
basis.
the
allowables
are
basically
a
limit
on
how
much
well...
how
much
each
well
can
produce.
and
because
wells
in
the
kansas
hugoton
field
do
not
produce
uniformly
because
the
purchaser's
requirements
are
for
different
or
for
other
reasons,
wells
can
either
over-produce
or
under-produce.
and
where
there
is
an
accumulated
underage,
the
underage
is
cancelled.
but
it
is--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--yes.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
yes.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
yes.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
the...
the
entire
purpose
at
the...
of
the
kansas
statute
was
to
amend
the
rule
of
capture.
that
is,
the
kansas
statute
provide...
basically
it
was
to
amend
that
provision
and
to...
to
obtain
a
method
of
allocation
and
production
which
would
enable
each
party
to
take
that
out.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
and
the
reason
for
that
was...
was
that
the
view
that
the
rule
of
capture
would
lead
to...
to
waste.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
well,
if...
if
there
was
a
rule
of
capture
under
the...
if
you
were
to,
say,
repeal
the
act
and
go
back
to
the
rule
of
capture...
just
take
that
as
an
illustration...
in
that
event
there
wouldn't
be
any
restriction
on
our
producers
in
producing
later
on.
there
would
be
no
limits
on
what
they
could
produce
in
order
to
catch
up.
but
kansas
hasn't
repealed
the
statute.
what
kansas
is
doing
is
continuing
the
process
of
having
allowables,
but
what
it's
saying
is
that
the
reinstatement
provision,
the
provision
that
has
existed
previously
in
the
law,
that
permits
a
producer
who
was
underproduced
an
opportunity
to
get
the
allowables
that
were
cancelled
reinstated
so
it
could
catch
up
and
get
its
fair
share
of
the
gas,
that
that
no
longer
will
exist.
and
the
purpose
of
that,
the
clear
purpose
as
shown
by
the...
by
the
record
in
this
case...
the
clear
purpose
of
their
doing
that
was
basically
to
confront
the
interstate
pipeline
companies
with
a
hobson's
choice.
either
they
had
to
start
taking
more
gas
out
of
the
kansas
hugoton
field
under
the
timetable
that
kansas
wanted
us
to
take
it
out
of
the
field,
or
else
they
would
forego
their
contractual
opportunities
to
take
that
gas
at
a...
at
a...
at
a
later
time.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
well--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--well,
i...
i
don't
know
that...
and
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
its
purpose.
but--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--if
there
was
a--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--not
it
it--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--a
rule
of...
i
assume
that
a
state
is
not
required
to
impose
a
law
which
regulates
taking
of
gas
from
a
field.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
in
some
ways,
yes,
i
think
it
is.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
well,
because--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--yes.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
justice
scalla,
here's
why
i
think
it's
worse.
if
you
had
a
rule
of
capture,
there
would
be
no
limit,
for
example,
on
the
producers
connected
to
our
pipeline
and
producing
gas
in
the
future
in
order
to
try
to
recapture
their
share
of
the
gas.
but
under
the...
under
the
regulation--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--well,
certainly
it
that
were
the
case
in
that
extreme
situation,
there
would
be...
would
be
nothing
left.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
well,
because...
because
the
intent
of
the
statute
is
that
you
be
permitted
to
take
your
fair
share
of
the
gas.
and
once
they're
regulating,
the
way
in
which
they
regulate
has
to
be
a
way
which
is
not
intended
to
interfere
with
the
purchasing
mix
regulation
under
the
natural
gas
act.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
once
they
assume
the
job
of
regulating--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--they
have
to
do
it
in
a
way
which
does
not
interfere
with
federal
regulation.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
justice
o'connor,
they
probably
have
some
incidental
effect,
and
that
was
considered--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--that
was
considered
in
the
northern
decision.
in
fact,
that
was
discussed
in
the
dissent
in
the
northern--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--well,
i
agree
that
allowables
are
under
traditional
state
regulation,
but
you
have
to
lock
at
the
central
purpose
of
the
regulation
that's
being
adopted.
it's
the
same
kind
of
test
that
the
court
adopted
in
the
schneidewind
case,
and
that
is
you
have
to
lock
at
the
central
purpose
of
what
they're
doing.
and
here
the
record
is
absolutely
clear...
no
question...
that
the
purpose
of
this
regulation,
its
central
purpose,
was
to
cause
interstate
pipelines
to
take
gas
out
at
a
faster
rate
on
the
timetable
prescribed
by
the
state
because--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--because
they--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--you
have
to
look
at
what
congress--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--yes.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
yes.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
yes.
and...
and...
and
that
was--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--yes.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
yes,
and
we
don't
contend
otherwise.
what
we
do
contend,
however,
that
in
conducting
that...
in
that
sphere
of
regulation,
which
is
within
their
jurisdiction,
they
cannot
do
it
in
a
way
which
interferes
with--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--federal
regulation.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
other
states--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--other...
other...
other
states
have
cancellation
provisions.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
but...
but
they...
but
one
big
difference
between
the
way
in
which
they
have
regulated
and
the
way
kansas
has
regulated
is
they
have
fixed
allowables
from
a
very
close
relationship
to
the
actual
market
demand
from
the
field.
what
kansas
has
done
for
a
great
many
years
is
to
fix
allowables
far
above
what
is
the
actual
demand
for
the
field,
and
what
that
has
done...
that...
and
that
was
done
to
try
to
induce
pipelines
to
take
more
gas
out
of
the
field
because
they
were
dissatisfied
with
what
pipelines...
the
amount
they
were
taking.
they
wanted
them
to
take
more
from
kansas.
now,
what
that
did
is
that
led
to
a
disparity,
a
substantial
disparity,
between
those
wells
which
were
underproduced
and
those
wells
which
were
overproduced.
and
the
overproduced
wells
were
generally
tied
to
the
intrastate
kansas
buyer,
whereas
the
underproduced
wells
were
tied
to
interstate
pipelines.
now,
having
created
this
great
disparity,
they
then
came
in
and
said,
well,
that
didn't
work.
we
didn't
get...
we
didn't
induce
more
takes
that
way.
now
we're
coming
up
with
what
chief
justice
schroeder
of
the
kansas
supreme
court
said
in
his
dissent,
now
we're
coming
up
with
the
ultimate
weapon,
and
that
is,
now
we're
going
to
say
if
you
don't
take
these
underages
which
have
accumulated
based
on
their
allowances
which
are
too...
were
too
high,
you're
going
to
lose
the
right
to
obtain
these
in
the
future.
and
so,
he
basically
was
giving
the
pipelines...
they
have
beer
basically
giving
the
pipelines
a...
a...
a
hobson's
choice:
either
they
start
taking
gas
out
on
the
timetable
prescribed
by
kansas
or...
and
which
means
we
can't
take
gas
from
other
states...
we'd
have
to
cut
back
there
on
the
basis
we're
doing
it...
or
else
we
lose
the
right
to
buy
this
gas
in
the
future.
now,
the
order,
as
i
say,
was
nominally
addressed
to
the
producer.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
no.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
no.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
well,
it's...
it's...
what
it
does
is
it
interferes
with
the
purchasing
mix
under
regulation
by
the
commission.
let
me
give
you
an
example.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
we
feel
it
does
not.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
no.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
no.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
us
to...
to
say
to
people
who
are
underproduced
that
we're
going
to
cancel
the
underages
and
not
permit
you
to
catch
up.
now--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--in...
in
the...
in
this
situation.
now,
i
think--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--well,
if
the
markets
improved.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
we...
we
would...
we
would
be
able
to
take
perhaps
this
gas.
in
fact,
that's
what
we're
saying.
in
the
1970s
when
there
were
very
strong
markets,
the
interstate
pipeline
companies
were
able
to
take
greater
volumes
of
gas,
and
many
of
the
underages
that
had
accumulated
before
that
time
were
taken.
and...
and
so,
the
natural
flow
of
the
market
was
permitted
to
operate,
and
we
did.
the
producers
connected
to
us
were
able
to
basically
produce
the
underages,
a
great
many
of
their
underages.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
no,
it
doesn't
have
to
change
its
scheme.
i'm
saying
simply
that
what
they...
what
they
should
have
done
was
let
the
thing
alone,
but
they
should
not
basically
introduce
regulations
that
are
intended
to
mix
into
the
purchase
mix
for
pipelines.
and
i--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--no.
what
we're
saying
in
effect
is
that
if
the
central
purpose
of
the
regulation
is
to
change
the
purchasing
mix
of
pipelines,
that
is
a...
a
area
which
is
preempted
under
the
natural
gas
act.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
i
would--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--i
would...
i
would
say
that
if
a
state
adopted
a...
a...
went
from
a
rule
of
capture
to
a
proration
plan,
that
it
would
be
our...
and
if
the
central
purpose
of
that
was
to
prevent
waste
and
to
assure
that
people
got
their
fair
share
of
the
gas,
we
would
consider
that
to
be
a
legitimate
function
of
the
state
within--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--within
the
producing--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--yes.
and
if
there's...
if
the...
if
the
intent
was
to
interfere
with
the
purchasing
mix
of
pipelines,
i
would
say
that
that
would
be
a--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--that
would
be
preempted.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
yes,
but
the...
but
the--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--well,
there
are
other
states
that
have
that
system,
and
in...
in--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--well,
if...
if
the
way
they
use
it
is
the
way
to
influence
the
purchasing
mix,
yes.
but
if...
but
where
you
have
a
situation
like
you
have
in
kansas
where
they
have
had
fixed
market...
demand
allowables
far
in
excess
of
the
actual
market
to
create
this
sort
of
excess
amount
of
allowables,
and
then
say
now
if
you
don't
take
all
of
this
within
a
certain
period
of
time,
you're
going
to
be...
you're
going
to
lose
all
that,
that
opportunity
to
take
that,
that
is
attempting
to
interfere
with
the
purchasing
mix.
and
it
was
clear
from
the
record.
the
witness
who
sponsored
the
exhibit
said
and
testified
unequivocally
that...
that
the
purpose
of
the
regulation
was
to
induce
pipelines
to
take
greater
volumes
from
the
kansas
hugoton
field
given
the
limited
market.
and
the...
the
kansas
district
court
in
its
decision
said
that
this
regulation
will
cause
a
loss...
permanent
loss
of
underages
and
change
the
mix
of
pipelines
which
are
transporting
gas
miles
away,
and
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
in
its
majority
decision
said
that
this
order
gives
us
pause.
it's
obviously
intended
for
the
pipelines.
and...
and
it's
for
this
reason
we
say
this
case
falls
within
northern
natural.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
we
don't
believe
the
mere
fact--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--yes,
well,
you're
not...
but
you
cannot
use...
you
cannot
regulate
in
production
in
a
way
which
interferes
with
federal
regulation.
in
mississippi
power--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--well,
but
it's
the
question
of...
and
i...
i
go
back
to
the
question
of
what
is
the
central
objective
of
the
regulation.
if
the
central
objective...
and
that
is
clear
on
the
record
here.
if
the
central
objective
of
the
regulation
is
to
basically
change
the
mix
for
pipelines,
that's
a
precluded
area.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
yes.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
what
i'm
saying...
what
i'm
saying
is
is
that
they
cannot
regulate
in
an
area
which
its
intended
purpose
is
to
change
the
mix
of
pipelines.
in
northern,
this
court
held
squarely
that
that
was
a
field
occupied
under
the
natural
gas
act.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
and
that
applies...
and
that
applies
to
this
case
as
well.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
well,
we
think
a
great
deal
is
left.
we
have
indicated
in
our...
in
our
briefs
that
there
are
actions
which
they
could
take
to
bring
the
field
into
balance.
they
could,
for
example,
fix
allowables
which
are
more
nearly
in
line
with
what's
going
on
in
the
market.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
if...
if...
if
what
they're
doing
is
trying
to
regulate
the
takes
from
the
field
of
the
purchasers
in
terms
of
trying
to
change
their
mix,
yes.
we
contend
that
that's
preempted
under
the
natural
gas
act--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--for
the
same
reasons
this
court
held
to
in
northern.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
well--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--no.
i
don't
say
that
it
must
take
that
into
account.
i...
i
say
that
it
cannot
issue
a
regulation
which
is
intended
to
change
the
mix.
let
me
show
you
the
conflict
here.
while
this...
after
our
notice
of
appeal
was
filed
in
this
case,
in
fact,
after
our
initial
brief
was
filed,
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
issued
a
order
concluding
a
long
proceeding
relating
to
the
purchase
mix
of
northwest
central
pipeline
corporation.
the
kansas
corporation
commission
was
an
intervenor
in
that
case.
and
a
number
of
parties
presented
their
views
as
to
what
the
purchase
mix
of
the
company
should
be,
including
some
parties
saying
that
they
thought
that
we
should
be
taking
greater
amounts
of
gas
from
the
kansas
hugoton
field.
and...
and
the
commission
heard
these
various
claims.
there
was
a
pretty
extensive
hearing,
administrative
law
judge's
decision.
and
the
commission
concluded
that
it
rejected
the
proposals
of
parties
that
more
gas
should
be
taken
from
the
kansas
hugoton
field
and
it
approved
as
prudent
the
purchasing
mix
being
used
by
the
company.
and
the...
the
mix
being
used
by
the
company
was
to
take
a
mix
of
low-priced
and
high-priced
gas
and
to
blend
it
together
and
to
try
to
arrive
at
a
target
market
price
which
would
enable
it
to
compete
against
alternative
fuels.
and
by
not
taking
all
of
the
kansas
hugoton
gas,
which
was
lower
priced,
and
reserving
that
for
mixing
with
some
of
the
higher
priced
gas
for
future
use,
the
company
was-able
to
be
able
to
reserve
some
to
be
competitive
in
the
future.
and
it
was
able
also
to
avoid
incurring
payments
for
gas
not
taken
in
other
areas.
now,
the
record
in
that
case
showed
that
had
we
taken
the
volumes
of
gas
from
the
kansas
hugoton
field
that
the
parties
wanted
us
to
take,
we
would
have
incurred
some
$77
million
of
take-or-pay
payments
in
just
a
period
of
eight
months.
and
the
commission
found
this...
found
what
we
were
doing
to
be
prudent.
now,
we
see
this
as--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--yes,
because
what...
what
we
have,
therefore,
is
a
sort
of
a...
what
as
i
see
as
a...
an
obstacle
between
the
program
that
kansas
wants
and
the
program
that
the
corporation
commission--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--that's
our
company.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
yes.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
no.
i'm
saying
that--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--we're
saying...
i'm...
i'm--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--i'm
just
giving
you
an
illustration
of
how
you
have
a
conflict.
the
conflict
is
that
we
can't
obviously
comply
with
both
programs.
we
can't
take
gas
out
in
the
mix
which
has
been
approved.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
i'm
saying
that...
that...
that
it
shows
that
there
is
an
obstacle,
that
it
presents
an
obstacle
to
following
the
mixes
that
are
approved
by
the
commission.
and
the
kansas
commission
intervened
in
that
case
so
that
it
seems
to
me
that
if...
if
kansas
can
do
this,
so
can
other
states
which
would
try
to
issue
regulations
which
will
favor
them
in
terms
of
your
taking
gas.
and
if
you
have
that,
then
what
you're
going
to
have
is
a
situation
where
the
kind
of
uniformity
of
regulation
that
was--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--intended
under
the
natural
gas
act--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--would
be
destroyed.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
well,
the--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--the
commission
is
now
supporting
the
kansas
position.
earlier
it
filed
a
brief
in
which
it
contended
that
the
kansas
order
was
preempted.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
now.
the--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--well,
i
don't...
i
don't
believe
that
if
you...
that
you
can
square
their
position
with
that
order.
the...
the
order
disapproved
proposals
to
take
more
gas
from
the
kansas
hugoton
field,
and
basically
approved
as
prudent
the
purchase
mix
obtained
by
the
companies.
i
don't
believe
you
can
square
their
position
in
this
case
that
there's
no--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--after
the
initial
brief,
but
we
refer
to
it
in
our
reply
brief.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
yes.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
close
at
this
point.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
yes.
justice
scalla,
it
is
just
net
correct
in
the
real
world
that
if...
if
we
were
to
take
more
kansas
gas,
we
wouldn't
be
taking
less
gas
elsewhere.
and
that
was--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--i'm
not
going
to
spend
much
time
on
that.
[laughter]
and
i
think
there...
and
i
don't
think
that
they
can
really
say
there's
no
conflict
between
the
purchasing
mix
case
approved
by
the
commission.
when
he
says
the
commission
would
have
approved
more
low
priced
gas
coming
out
of
kansas,
that's
not
correct.
that
was
proposed
in
that
case.
the
proposal
in
that
case...
one
of
the
proposals
was
we
should
take
more
of
that
gas,
and
the
commission
said
no.
they
didn't
think
that
was...
they
found
that
there
were
reasons
the
company
had
given
as
to
why
it
shouldn't
be
taken
that
were...
that
were
reasonable.
now,
with
respect
to
the...
the...
the
solicitor
takes
the
position
that
northern
is
different
than
this
case
because
in
northern
the
order
was
directed
to
northern
and
because
there
were
certain
criminal
penalties
involved
whereas
here
they
say
that
the...
what
we're
faced
with
are
certain
economic
consequences.
and
therefore,
we
are
simply
going
to
have
to
take
that
into
consideration
in
deciding
whether
or
not
we
want
to
buy
more
kansas
gas
or
suffer
the
possibility
of
not
being
able
to
buy
it
in
the
future.
now,
we
submit
that
the
modest
kinds
of
criminal
penalties
that
were
involved
in
the
northern
natural
case
are
far
less
significant
than
the
sanctions
of
losing
the
supply.
the
gas
supply
is
the
lifeblood
of
interstate
pipeline
companies.
and
if
we
lose
supply,
we
shorten
the
economic
life
of
the
pipeline
system.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
that...
justice
o'connor,
that
is...
that
is
incorrect.
the
purpose
of
this
rule
was
to
permanently
cancel.
so,
you
do
lose
it.
you
do
lose
it.
now,
you
had
a
certain
time
period.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
yes.
the
rule
specifically
provides
for
permanent
cancellation.
so,
he
is
just
wrong
about
that.
now,
the...
and
he's
also
wrong
about
the
fact--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--no.
you
have
a
certain
period
of
time
to
get...
to
ask
for
reinstatement--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--but
once
that's
over
with,
that's
a
permanent
cancellation.
you
have
to
ask--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
it...
if
you...
you
have
three
years
to
ask
for
reinstatement,
five
years
to
produce
it
once
you
did.
he's
correct
about
that.
but
after
that,
it's
permanently...
permanently
gone.
now,
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
the
producers
in
this
field
who
are
underproduced
were
against
this
rule.
and
those
producers
are
the
ones
who
they
say
are
going
to
get
gas
drained
away
permanently
and
that's
why
they're
passing
this
rule
to
protect
them.
but
they
were
against
this
rule.
the
people
who
were
in
favor
of
it
were
the
people
who
were
overproduced.
and
why?
because
what
this
rule
is
going
to
do
is--
mr.
harold
l.
talisman
--thank
you.
