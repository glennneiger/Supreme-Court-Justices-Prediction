mr.
frederic
j.
cowan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
what
is
at
stake
in
this
case
before
the
court
today
is
this
court's
long-established
jurisprudence
of
individualized
consideration
in
matters
of
death
penalty
cases
focusing
on
the
nature
of
the
crime
aria
the
personal
culpability
of
the
individual.
to
accept
petitioner's
point
of
view,
this
court
would
have
to
accept
the
notion
that
suddenly
at
age
18
individuals
become
sophisticated,
nature
and
responsible
as
adults.
not
only
does
that
notion
fly
in
the
face
of
common
sense,
it
also
flies
in
the
face
of
a
national
consensus
that
does
exist
which
is
that
individuals
mature
and
grow
at
different
rates
depending
upon
who
they
are
and
what
their
individual
circumstances
are.
the
petitioner
would
have
this
court
draw
a
line,
a
bright
line,
that
would
exempt
categorically
all
individuals
in
a
certain
class
depending
upon
one
factor,
namely,
chronological
age
that
is
not
related
or
not
directly
or
necessarily
related
to
the
individual
culpability
of
the
particular
defendant.
this
case
that
is
before
the
court
today
shows
what
a
mistake
it
would
be
to
shift
the
focus
of
jurisprudence
away
from
individual
culpability.
kevin
stanford
committed
these
crimes
with
deliberateness
and
intention,
with
purposefulness.
his
motive
was
to
eliminate
a
witness.
he
was
mature
and
sophisticated
enough
to
sodomize
and
terrorize
a
young
woman,
calm
and
calculated
enough
to
allow
her
to
smoke
a
cigarette
before
executing
her,
and
calm
enough
to
return
to
the
scene
of
the
crime
and
steal
some
300
cartons
of
cigarettes.
in
addition,
the
trial
judge
in
fact,
after
hearing
all
the
evidence
and
considering
all
the
circumstances
before
the
court,
made
a
finding...
and
this
at
joint
appendix
page
111...
that
this
individual
was
beyond
rehabilitation
whether
in
or
outside
of
an
institution.
mr.
frederic
j.
cowan
your
honor,
i
am
not
aware
of
any,
and
i
think
the
point
that
is
raised
with
respect
to
rehabilitation
is
very
such
the
question
of
if
someone
at
age
17
is
amenable
to
rehabilitation,
does
that
mean
that
someone
at
age
19
is
not.
clearly
that
also...
i
don't
think
there's
any
scientific
basis
to
demonstrate
that
that's
true,
and
it
certainly
files
in
the
face
of
common
sense.
mr.
frederic
j.
cowan
your
honor,
i
believe
there
is
although
i
must
say
i...
i
cannot
cite
you
chapter
and
verse
as--
mr.
frederic
j.
cowan
--your
honor,
i
can
only
point
to
this
particular
case
and
this
particular
individual
where
there
was
a
long
history
of
going
in
and
out
of
institutions
providing
him
with
opportunities
to
be
rehabilitated.
in
fact,
in
this
particular
case,
the
individual
was
in
a
treatment
program
just
prior
to
the
time
of
the
crime.
there
was
testimony
in
the
record
in
the...
in
the
hearing
process
that
some
86
percent
of
the
people
who
went
through
that
program
were
successfully
treated.
he
was
one
of
the
14
percent
apparently
who
was
not.
to
rely
on
an
age
alone...
a
bright
line
of
age
alone,
is
unlike
this
court's
previous
decisions
in
enmund
v.
florida,
tison
v.
arizona
where,
for
example,
the
culpability...
the
question
was
based
upon
the
personal
culpability
as
it
related
to
the
individual's
participation
in
that
crime.
age
in
itself
is
an
imperfect
proxy,
if
you
will,
or
a
symbol
of
factors
that
are
more
important
such
as
maturation,
sophistication,
ability
to
appreciate
the
seriousness
of
the
crime,
and
the
consequences
of
the
crime.
we
all
know
as
a
matter
of
common
experience
that
maturity
exists
on
both
sides
of
that
line
and
sophistication
exists
on
both
sides
of
that
bright
line
the
petitioner
wishes
to
draw.
the
sentencer,
in
fact--
mr.
frederic
j.
cowan
--your
honor,
i
think
it
is
fair
in
this
case
to
rely
on
your
own
judgment
and
your
own
knowledge
and
your
own
intuitive
sense
in
that
we
know
that
individuals
do
vary
at
different
ages.
mr.
frederic
j.
cowan
your
honor,
i
think
there
is
no...
there's
nothing
that
i
am
aware
of
that
indicates
one
way
or
another
as
far
as
the
deterrent
value
separating
juveniles
from
adults.
i
would
only
say
to
you
that
if
there
is
a
deterrent
value,
i
see
no
reason
why
it
would
not
apply
to
juveniles
as
well
as
to
adults.
in
particular,
in
this
case
you
had
a...
you
had
a
juvenile
who
was
street
wise,
who
had
been
in
and
out
of
the
criminal
justice
system
for
a
number
of
years
who
was
capable
of
making
the
kinds
of
national
decisions
that
he
made
in
this
particular
case.
i
believe
it's
important
to
avoid
in
thinking
about
these
problems
the
notion
of
stereotypes
and
thinking
about
the
average
17
year
old
or
the
average
16
year
old.
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
the
juvenile
such
as
the
one
who
is
before
us
who
was,
in
fact,
the
most
sophisticated,
who
had
been...
had
seen
the
various
aspects
of
the
criminal
justice
system,
who
acted
with
the
kind
of
deliberation
and
performed
the
kinds
of
acts
that
he
did.
another
thing
i
think
is
important
to
think
about
in
determining
whether
a
bright
line
is
a
good
test
is
to
consider
that
if
that
test
is
developed,
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
writing
into
the
constitution
a
principle
that
will
guarantee
injustice,
and
by
that
i
mean
take
the
example
of
two
individuals
who
both
commit
jointly
a
crime,
a
murder,
one
17,
one
18.
let
us
suppose
that
the
18
year
old
is
unquestionably
less
culpable
than
the
17
year
old.
he
didn't
pull
the
trigger.
he
didn't
plan
the
crime,
but
he
was
there
in
such
a
way
as
to
exhibit
the
extreme
indifference
to
human
life
as
in
tison.
the
petitioner
would
have
this
court
say
that
the
17
year
old
shall
be
exempt,
the
clearly
more
culpable
of
the
two,
and
the
18
year
old
will
be,
in
fact,
put
to
death
even
though
he
is
clearly
less
culpable.
or
compare...
and
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
a
case
like
that
will
present
itself
to
this
court
if
a
bright
line
is
drawn,
and
the
opponents
of
the
death
penalty
will
be
before
you
asking
you
to
rule
out
the
capital
punishment
for
the
older
one
on
the
grounds
that
it
is
freakish
and
arbitrary
to
do
so.
compare
this
case
stanford
versus
tison.
can
we
say
with
any
degree
of
assurance,
if
we
have
a
bright
line,
that
the
type
of
culpability
exhibited
by
stanford
is
less
than
that...
or
excuse
me...
is...
is
less
than
that
exhibited
by
the
tison
brothers
in
their
particular
case?
i
think
not.
or
take
jose
hyde,
the
original
case
that
was
before
this
court,
the...
someone
who
was
thought
to
be
17
from
georgia
and
then
it
was
discovered
that,
no,
he
was
perhaps
19.
is
today
he
any
different
now
just
because
the
fact
happened
to
be
discovered?
is
the
crime
any
different?
is
his
degree
of
culpability
any
different
because
now
he
is
eligible
for
the
death
penalty
and
under
petitioner's
point
of
view
would
not
be?
your
honor,
as
legislatures...
legislatures
can
draw
lines
like
this.
they
can
draw
such
lines
for
reasons
of
policy.
they
can
draw
such
lines
for
whatever
reason
they
want
to.
they
may
wish
to
exhibit
mercy,
and
that
is
fine
and
that
is
wise
and
acceptable.
but
the
constitution...
the
constitution
is
an
instrument
of
justice,
not
an
instrument
of
mercy.
and
i
think
that
that
is
what
petitioners
are
asking
here.
this
court
has
recognized
in
california
v.
brown
that
very
principle,
in
fact,
where
it
held
that
a
defendant
did
not
have
an
eighth
amendment
right
to
have
put
before
the
jury
considerations
of
sympathy
and
considerations
of
mercy.
the
petitioner
seeks
to
convert
what
is,
in
fact,
a
mitigating
factor,
that
of
youth,
into
a
constitutional
prohibition.
and
i
see
no
reason
why
we
could
not
talk
about
other
mitigating
factors
and
attempt
to
convert
those
into
constitutional
prohibitions
as
well.
mr.
frederic
j.
cowan
your
honor,
the
evidence
that
he
was
not
allowed
to
put
on...
the
bulk
of
that
evidence
related
to
the
witness'
propose
testimony
of
what
it
was
like
to
be
on
death
row.
and
in
addition,
his
contacts
with
the
petitioner
were
very
minimal.
the
trial
judge
in
that
case
made
a
determination
that
the
evidence
was
not
competent
and
that
it
was
cumulative.
we
cannot,
it
seems
to
me,
fashion
or
attempt
to
fashion
a
rule
to
tell
a
trial
judge
that
you
can...
you
have
to
let
everything
in
no
matter
what
is
offered.
surely,
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
a
trial
judge
should
be
able
to
continue
to
follow
the
rules...
normal
rules
of
evidence,
and
that
was
what
was
done
in
this
case.
mr.
frederic
j.
cowan
your
honor,
it's...
i
would
have
to
take
each
of
the
positions.
i...
i
believe
that
the
plurality
decision
was
incorrect,
your
honor.
but
even
assuming
that
it
was
correct,
i
think
that...
that
in
this
particular
case
we
are
talking
about
significant
differences
because
in...
as
you
recall,
in
thompson
v.
oklahoma,
there
was
not
a
single
state
that
had,
in
fact,
set
the
line
below
the
age
of
16.
here
we
have
six
states
cut
of
18
that
have
explicitly
addressed
the
question
where
the
line
has
been
drawn
below
the
age
of
18.
in
addition,
your
honor,
one
of
the
points
that
was
very
clear...
clearly
made
in
the
plurality
of
the
thompson
case
by
justice
stevens
was
the
fact
that
there
was
no
state
that
treated
15
year
olds
other
than
initially
in
the
juvenile
process,
in
the
juvenile
jurisdiction.
that
is
not
true
with
respect
to
17
year
olds.
seventeen
year
old
murderers...
there
are
some
20
states...
about
20
states
who
either
automatically
waive
a
17
year
old
murderer
to
adult
court
or
who
have
no
jurisdiction
over
that
at
that...
at
that
time.
so,
we
have
an
entirely
different
situation,
it
seems
to
me,
than
we
did
in
thompson.
mr.
frederic
j.
cowan
total,
your
honor?
we
have
approximately
34
or
35.
mr.
frederic
j.
cowan
there
is...
there
is
one.
there
is
this
petitioner,
your
honor.
well,
he's...
was
under
18
at
the
time
that
he
committed
the
crime.
i
might
say
while
on
the
subject
of--
mr.
frederic
j.
cowan
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frederic
j.
cowan
your
honor,
it's
a
little
bit
complicated,
but
let
we
explain
very
briefly,
if
i
can.
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
this
offense,
kentucky
had
no
explicit
minimum
in
effect.
this
was
in
1981
that
the
offense
was
committed.
at
that
time,
the
only
effective
statute
on
the
books
was
krs
208.17c
which
is
the
juvenile
transfer
statute.
in
that
statute,
your
honor,
the
statute
very
explicitly
sets
out
that
individuals
under
the
age
of
16
who
committed
capital
offenses...
and
it
used
the
word
"capital
offenses"...
may
be
waived
to
adult
court
if
other
factors
are
considered.
five...
section
5(c)
of
that
statute
also
explicitly
says
that
once
the
trial
judge...
having
had
the
case
waived
to
him,
once
the
trial
judge
refuses
to
send
it
back
to
juvenile
court,
then
the
case
will
proceed
against
that...
that
individual
as
against
any
other
defendant.
quite
clearly,
kentucky
in
that
statute
alone
demonstrated
its
awareness
that
it,
in
fact,
it
was
dealing
with
capital
offenders
under
the
age
of
16.
and,
of
course,
we're
talking
about
one
that's
17.
at
that
time,
also
kentucky,
to
be
quite
clear
with
you
and
quite...
quite
candid,
kentucky
had
adopted
in
1980
the
unified
juvenile
code,
delayed
its
effective
date
until
1982.
in
that
code,
it
said
that
there
would
be
an
18
year
old
minimum
for...
for
juvenile
death
penalty.
that
was
delayed.
the
1982
general
assembly
deferred
it
until
1984,
and
it
was
only
in
1986
with
an
effective
date
in
1987
that
kentucky
adopted
a
minimum
age
of
16.
but
kentucky
now
has
the
minimum
age
of
16.
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
offense,
there
was
no
effective
minimum
in
effect.
in
discussing
consensus
analysis
in
trying
to
determine
what
is
the
best
approach
to
determining
what
societal
values
are,
the
court
it
seems
to
me
has
to
be
quite
cautious
in
trying
to
reach
that
decision.
the
constitution
shall
not
catch
a
pendulum
at
one
and
of
its
swing
and
freeze
that
notion
into
law.
the
attitude
in
this
society
about
youth
is
very
such
in
a
state
of
flux
and
has
been
for
a
number
of
years.
and
we
see
movement
in
the
various
legislatures.
it
is
commonplace
i
think
to...
to
hear
people
say
youth
are
growing
up
so
much
faster
today.
they're
so
such
more
sophisticated.
they're
exposed
to
so
many
more
types
of
things.
and
i
think
common
experience
tell
us
that
that
is
the
case.
under
gregg
v.
georgia,
the
petitioner
has
a
heavy
burden
to
demonstrate
that
there
is
a
national
consensus
against
the
execution
of
17
year
olds.
as
i
have
pointed
out,
six
out
of
the
18
states
that
expressly
have
expressed...
have...
have
expressly
drawn
a
line
have
done
so
at
17
or
below.
eighteen
other
states
allow
on
their
face
for
the
execution
of
those
under
the
age
of
18.
i
believe
these
18
should
be
counted
in
determining
a
national
consensus.
but
even
if
one
were
to
follow
the
type
of
analysis
in
the
plurality
in
thompson
or
the
concurrence
in
thompson,
i
think
that
we
have
to
realize
that
significant
evidence
relating
to
the
interpretation
of
those
18
states'
statute
has
been
overlooked
because
they
do,
as
in
kentucky's
case
that
was
in
effect
then
explicitly
recognized
the
notion
of
capital
offense
in
those
juvenile
transfer
statutes.
when
we
talk
about...
when
we
talk
about
consensus,
we
do
have
to
at
some
point
go
beyond
mere
counting,
and
i
think
the
court
has
to
consider
what
the
particular
nature
of
the
crime...
nature
of
the
punishment
is.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
punishment
should
be
something
that
is
patently
offensive
to
the
national
conscience
or
so
revolting
or
abhorrent
or
such
an
aberration
that
we
can
comfortably
say
that
it
is
cruel
and
unusual
under
the
eighth
amendment.
if
you
take,
for
example,
a
case
of...
suppose
we
had
a
felony
limit
that
was
set
in
order
to
be
tried
as
a
felony,
and
every
state
in
the
union
had
$300
set
as
the
minimum
for
someone
to
be
tried
as
a
felony,
but
one
state
had
$100...
so
it
was
49
to
1...
then
surely
it
would
not
be
unconstitutional
for
that
one
state
to
express...
to
have
that
$100.
we
must
recognize
in...
in
doing
consensus
analysis,
recognize
the
notion
of
federalism
that
is
central
to
our...
central
to
our
constitutional
scheme.
as
was
noted
by
justice
o'connor
in
tennessee
v.
garner,
the
eighth
amendment
is
not
violated
every
time
a
state
reaches
a
conclusion
different
from
the
majority
of
its
sisters
over
how
best
to
administer
its
criminal
laws.
the
petitioner's
bright
line
analysis
i
believe
is
further
flawed,
and
i
think
these
are
some
of
the
comments
that
justice
scalia
was
getting
to
when
looking
at
the
question
of
eligibility
for
juries
or
eligibility
for
voting,
these
sorts
of
things.
i
might
point
out,
of
course,
that
there
is
at
least
one
very
distinct
age
that
we
know
that
is
virtually
nationwide...
i
think
nationwide
now,
and
that's
21
years
old
in
order
to
purchase
alcoholic
beverages.
but
the
point
is
that
all
these
things
are
passed
depending
upon
what
the
particular
bars
or
what
the
particular
circumstance
is.
and
as
justice
scalia
noted,
they
are
done
for
a
purpose
of
administrative
convenience,
the
18
year
olds
for
voting
and
driving
and...
and
this
sort
of
thing.
it
would
be
best
i
think
for
all
of
us
if
we
can
make
an
individualized
determination
for
voting,
for
serving
on
a
grand
jury,
whatever
it
happens
to
be,
as
to
who
was
really
mature
enough
and
sophisticated
enough
to
be
able
to
do
that.
but
clearly
the
transaction
costs
of
that
are
too
high.
but
the
criminal
justice
system...
the
very
premise
of
the
criminal
justice
system
is
based
upon
an
individualized
consideration
of
each
individual.
that's
what
it's
set
up
for.
that's
what
it
is
capable
of
doing,
and
that's
what
it
should
do.
and
that's
why
we
ask
that
it
be
continued
in
this
particular
case.
and
i
might
add
particularly...
and
this
court
has
recognized...
in
dealing
with
problems
of
crimes
and
punishment
we're
dealing
with
an
entirely
different
matter
than
we
are
in
dealing
with
things
like
juries...
serving
or
a
jury
and
voting
and
whatnot.
mr.
frederic
j.
cowan
on
serving
on
a
jury,
your
honor?
mr.
frederic
j.
cowan
well--
mr.
frederic
j.
cowan
--oh,
serving
on
a...
that
tries
the
juvenile?
mr.
frederic
j.
cowan
the
age
minimum?
your
honor,
i
simply
don't
think
there's
any
way
that
we
can
put
that
into
a...
in
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
by
saying
that
people
have
to--
mr.
frederic
j.
cowan
--yes,
your
honor,
i
suppose
it's--
mr.
frederic
j.
cowan
--your
honor,
i--
mr.
frederic
j.
cowan
--your
honor,
i
would
respectfully
disagree
with
you
and
say,
no,
it's
not
because
i
think
it
depends
on
what
your
definition
of
your
peers
are.
and
i
don't
think
that
we
should
be
in
a
position
where
we
say
that
anyone
under
the
age
of
18
should
be
allowed
to
serve
on...
on
the
jury.
a
national
consensus
does
exist
i
believe
and
it...
it
is
shown
and
the
national
consensus
is
that
youths
do,
in
fact,
mature
at
different
rates
depending
upon
their
individual
circumstances.
and
it
is
shown
objectively
by
the
fact
that
all
states...
all
states...
allow
17
year
old
murderers
to
be
tried
as
adults.
and
except
for
those
states
that
have
a
minimum
of
18
and
a
death
penalty,
they
all
expose
those
17
year
olds
to
their
maximum
penalty
authorized
by
law.
your
honors,
in
kentucky's
case,
we
gave
full
individualized
consideration
to
kevin
stanford,
and
we
fully
considered
the
matters
relating
to
his
youth
and
all
the
mitigating
circumstances
relating
to
any
explanation
that
he
might
have
going
that
would
diminish
his
personal
responsibility
for
the
crime.
not
only
was
there
a
transfer
hearing,
at
which
a
full
record
was
developed,
there
was
a
circuit
court
hearing,
a
trial
level
hearing.
there
was
a
motion
on
whether
to
retransfer
him.
the
grand
jury
reindicted
him
because
it
was
not
informed
the
first
time
that
it
had
the
opportunity
to
send
him
back.
and
the
jury
itself
gave
full
individualized
consideration
to
him.
i
would
ask
the
court
to
make
a
note
of
the
instructions
at
joint
appendix
100
and
101.
that...
those
instructions
laid
out
20
mitigating
factors...
20
mitigating
factors...
for
the
jury
to
consider,
including
the
fact
that
he
was
of
very
youthful
age,
he
was
only
17
years
old,
that
he
was
led
into
the
crime
by
another
person,
that
he
was
emotionally
immature,
that
because
of
his
age,
he
was
capable
of
changing,
and
some
16
other
factors.
every
single
one
of
the
mitigating
factors
asked
for
by
the
defendant
was
granted
in
this
case
verbatim,
word
for
word.
kentucky
also--
mr.
frederic
j.
cowan
--your
honor,
i
think...
i
think
there...
there
is,
and
i
think
that
it
has
to
do
with
the
national
consensus.
if
you
believe
there
was
a
national
consensus
against
the
execution
of
15
year
olds,
the
evidence
supporting
a
national
consensus
against
the
execution
of
17
years
olds
is
significantly
less.
mr.
frederic
j.
cowan
sixteen?
it
is
also
significantly
less
although,
of
course,
there
is
a
difference
of
three
states
in
talking
about
the
states
that
have
directly
addressed
the
question.
in
kentucky's
case,
however...
and
this
addresses
justice
o'connor's
point...
the...
there
was
an
explicit
rejection
of
the
18
year
minimum,
and
i
think
that
certainly
that
is
a
matter
of
some
note.
in
conclusions,
i
would
like
to
say
that
kentucky
gave
full
individualized
consideration
as
required
by
the
constitution
under
eddings
and
lockett
to
this
individual.
they
provided,
in
fact,
protections
beyond
the
constitutional
minimum.
the
bright
line
test
proposed
by
petitioners,
it
seems
to
me,
destroys
a
key
tenet
of
eighth
amendment
analysis
based
upon
individualized
consideration.
the
constitution
is
very
much
an
instrument
of
justice,
not
an
instrument
of
mercy.
and
finally,
common
sense
dictates
that
youths
mature
at
different
rates,
and
that
is
reflected
in
a
national
consensus
that
youth
may
be
treated
as
adults
in
all
these
various
circumstances.
for
the
reasons
we
have
stated,
your
honors,
i
would
like
to--
mr.
frederic
j.
cowan
--your
honor.
i
am
not
sure
how...
what
other
way
to
proceed
other
than...
because
under
tropp
v.
dulles,
which
this
court
has
always
followed
in
talking
about
evolving
standards
of
decency,
we
have
to
reach
some
determination
as
to
what
those
evolving
standards
of
decency
are.
and
i
certainly
think
this
court
is
free
to
make
that
determination
as
it
best
sees
fit.
however,
i
think
the
way
of
looking
at
objective
indicia
first
at
the
very
beginning
is...
is
the
most
appropriate
way,
and
particularly
at
legislatures,
since
they
are
the
best
expression
we
have
in
this
nation
of
the
expression
of
the
popular
will.
i
think
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
determine
and
fashion
some
other
type
of
analysis.
this
court
i
suppose...
i
don't...
i
don't
ask
you
to
do
this,
but
you
could
commission
all
kinds
of
public
opinion
polls,
but
that
certainly
is
not
something--
mr.
frederic
j.
cowan
--i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
hear
your
question.
mr.
frederic
j.
cowan
i
don't
believe
so,
not
in
terms,
your
honor,
of
trying
to
count
states
and
that
sort
of
thing.
mr.
frederic
j.
cowan
well,
i
think
that
the--
mr.
frederic
j.
cowan
--well,
i...
i
think
the
court
has
to
look
at
legal
history
and
a
variety
of
things
along...
along
those
lines
that
it
i
believe
did
under
weems
and
tropp
v.
dulles.
i
don't
think...
i
think
that's
about
as
well
as
we
can
do
if
we're
trying
to
discern
what,
in
fact,
are
evolving
standards
of
decency.
my
point
is
with
respect
to
those,
however,
that
with...
at
least
as
far
as
juveniles
are
concerned,
we
know
that
society
is
in
a
state
of
flux
with...
with
reference
to
their
particular
attitude
about
those
juveniles.
we
know,
for
example,
that
we
have
to...
or
i
shouldn't
say
we
know.
we
have
to
consider
new
types
of
problems
that
come
up
in
our
society,
whether
they
be
problems
of
drugs
or
problems
with
drunken
driving
and
this
sort
of
thing.
and
it
is
very...
the
court
must
be
very
cautious
as
far
as
freezing
into
constitutional
law
some
particular
aspect
that
says
that
this
is
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
for
the
reasons
that
i've
stated,
your
honors,
we
ask
that
you
affirm
the
judgment
below.
thank
you.
