mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
eighth
amendment
prohibits
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
on
a
juvenile
who
was
17
at
the
time
of
committing
a
capital
offense.
one
point
of
agreement
for
all
members
of
the
court
in
thompson
v.
oklahoma
is
that
there
is
some
age
below
which
a
juvenile's
crime
can
never
be
punished
by
death.
thus,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
not
whether
a
line
should
be
drawn
specifying
a
minimum
age
for
the
death
penalty,
but
where
the
line
should
be
drawn,
and
the
petitioner
submits
that
the
line
should
be
drawn
at
the
age
of
18
because
it
is
the
most
objective.
it
is
the
most
justifiable.
it
is
the
most
logical
line
that's
capable
of
resolving
the
issue
presented
in
this
case.
as
the
briefs
in...
filed
in
this
case
indicate,
18
is
a
very
conservative
age
for
determination
as
to
when
a
person
attains
full
maturity.
indeed,
the
maturation
process
is
a
continuing
one
that
lasts
until
a
person
is
into
their
early
to
mid
20s.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
you're
absolutely
correct.
as
human
beings,
we
are
simply
incapable
of
making
infallible
judgments.
consequently,
our
society
and
the
legal
system
are
imperfect.
yet,
in
striving
for
perfection
and
in
order
to
ensure
fundamental
fairness
in
the
operation
of
our
criminal
justice
system,
jurisprudence
in
capital
cases
has
consistently
demanded
certainty
and
reliability
not
only
in
capital
sentencing
procedures
and
trials,
but
in
the
outcome
as
well.
however,
a
constitutionally
acceptable
degree
of
reliability
and
certainty
cannot
be
attained
in
a
case
in
which
the
state
seeks
the
execution
of
a
person
who
is
under
the
age
of
18
at
the
time
of
committing
a
crime.
the
uncertainty
about
when
a
particular
juvenile
has
fully
developed
and
has
fully
evolved
into
an
adult
has
caused
society
to
draw
a
bright
line.
that
line
is
an
expression
of
society's
confidence
and
society's
certainty
that
those
under
the
age
of
18
do
not
possess
an
adult's
level
of
emotional,
intellectual
and
cognitive
development.
and
it
is
because
of
the
uncertainty
as
to
when
a
child
actually
evolves
into
an
adult
that
society
has
drawn
this
bright
line;
the
boundary
has
been
drawn
because
of
this
uncertainty.
the
uncertainty
extends
not
only
in
matters
as
everyday
life,
such
as
voting
rights
or
the
right
to
sit
on
a
jury,
but
certainly
it
extends
to
the
area
of
capital
punishment
and
sentencing.
eighteen
is
that
point
in
a
person's
life
where
society
feels
comfortable
and
confident
in
assuming
that
one
is
ready
to
assume
the
privileges,
rights
and
responsibilities
of
adulthood.
the
failure
of
the
court
to
set
18
as
the
minimum
age
for
the
imposition
of
capital
punishment
puts
society
in
a
position
it
has
sought
to
avoid,
and
that
is
of
making
an
error
in
determining
when
a
child
has
actually
evolved
into
an
adult.
that
risk
of
error
we
submit
is
simply
intolerable
in
a
capital
case
especially
where
society
has
chosen
to
err,
if
it
does
so,
on
the
side
of
caution
by
creating
a
boundary
between
childhood
and
adulthood.
we
simply
cannot
attain
a
sufficient
level
of
constitutional
certainty
and
reliability
in
death
penalty
cases
unless
18
is
established
as
a
minimum
age
for
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
and
thereby
eliminate
the
risk
that
a
child
who
has
not
evolved
into
an
adult
is
exposed
to
capital
punishment.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
there's
no
denying.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
our
argument
is
that
a...
the
person
who
has
not
attained
the
age
of
18
certainly
shouldn't
be
executed.
and
you're
quite
correct.
there
is
an
element
of
arbitrariness
in
any
type
of
line-drawing.
it's
unavoidable.
but
as
the
court
noted
in
salom
v.
helm,
that
line-drawing
is
a
problematical
issue,
it's
a
difficult
issue,
but
it
is
one
that
exists
in
eighth
amendment
cases.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
notwithstanding
any
arbitrariness,
it's
a
justifiable
arbitrariness
and
it's
a
permissible
arbitrariness
because
society
has
made
that
choice.
it
has
drawn
that
line
in
so
many
other
aspects
of
our
lives
because
the
person
who
is
17
years
old,
11
months
and
364
days
cannot
vote
under
any
circumstances,
but
a
person
who
is
18
years
old
and
one
day
can
vote.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
no,
not
as
far
as
operation
of
a
motor
vehicle,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
but
the
theory
is
constant,
your
honor,
whether
we
are
talking
about
the
imposition
of
capital
punishment
or
criminal
sanctions,
and
also
whether
or
not
we
are
talking
about
voting
rights
or
the
ability
to
sit
on
a
jury.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
case
is
a
perfect
example
of
why
individual
considerations
don't
work,
why
the
safeguards
that
are
presently
in
place
don't
work.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
your
honor,
let
we
answer
this
in...
with...
in
two
different
ways.
first
of
all,
the
primary
safeguard
against
arbitrary
imposition
of
capital...
of
capital
punishment
is
the
introduction
of
mitigating
evidence.
but
here,
as
i
have
pointed
out
in
the
brief,
that
safeguard
was...
was
hollow
because
mitigating
evidence
was
excluded
unjustifiably.
and
the
mitigating
evidence
that
i'm
talking
about
is
testimony
from
a...
inmate
on
kentucky's
death
row
about
rehabilitation
programs
within
the
adult
criminal
system.
he
not
only
knew
about
that
information,
but
he
had
personal
experience
with
the
petitioner
before
this
crime
occurred
and
after
this
crime
occurred.
surely
that
is
relevant
mitigating
evidence,
but
the
jury
wasn't
allowed
to
hear
that.
not
only
that,
as
i...
as
i've
pointed
out
in
the
brief,
youth
as
a
mitigating
circumstance
under
kentucky's
death
penalty
statute
is
also
a
hollow
safeguard
because
it
operates
on
a
sliding
scale
insofar
as
it
protects
an
individual...
theoretically
protects
an
individual
who
is
16.
it
is
also
protects
an
individual
who
is
30.
the--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--i
think
it
is
equitable,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
we
are
asking
the
court
to
carve
particularly
new
or
novel
ground.
we
are
asking
the
court
to
rely
on
common
sense,
experience
and
what
our
society
has...
our
society
has
made
a
decision
that
individuals
who
are
under
18
are
children.
they
have
not
evolved
into
adults,
and
people
on
the
other
side
of
the
line
of
18
have
evolved
into
adults.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
your
honor,
with
respect
to
the
consideration
that
the
jury
might
have
given
mitigating
circumstances,
there's
no
guarantee
here
what,
if
any,
consideration
they
gave
those
mitigating
circumstances
and
the
extent--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--well,
the...
i
think
the
answer
was...
was
very
obvious,
and
it
was
the
one
that
trial
counsel
proposed
in
this
case,
your
honor.
trial
counsel
asked
the
judge
to
acquire
the
jury
to
make
specific
findings
as
to
the
existence
of
mitigating
circumstances
or
the
absence
of
those
circumstances.
in
that
way,
we
would
at
least
have...
be
assured
that
the
jury
did
actually
consider--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--your
honor,
i...
i
think,
as
the
court
stated
in
eddings,
that
youth
is
not
just
another
mitigating
circumstance.
it
should
be
the
pervasive
factor
in
a
case
when
the
state
is
trying
to
seek
capital
punishment
for
a
juvenile.
it
can't
be
treated
categorically
like
every
other
mitigating
circumstance.
the
court
i
think--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--i'm
asking...
i--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--yes,
that's
correct.
but
if
the
jury
is
to
consider
youth
as
a
mitigating
circumstance,
it
needs
to
go
beyond
the
plain...
the
meaning...
the
plain
words
"you
are
to
consider
the
defendant's
age.
"
how
do
we
know
what
weight
the
jury
gave
to
the
mitigating
circumstance
of
youth?
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
i...
i
think
it...
it's
particularly
special
in
the
case
of
a
juvenile
where
who
the
state
is
trying
to
execute.
we
need
to
be
absolutely
certain
that
the
jury
takes
into
account
all
of
the
relevant
mitigating
circumstances.
we
don't
have
that
assurance
in
dealing
with
juveniles
in
the
present...
under
the
present
system
of
procedural
and
in
substantive
safeguards.
they...
juveniles
should
not
be
treated
categorically
or
lumped
in
together
with
adults
for
all...
for
all
purposes,
particularly
in
capital
punishment
purposes.
i
think
that's...
that's
a
fundamental
flaw
in...
in
the
present
system.
they
are
treated
absolutely
the
same.
there
is
no
distinction.
youth
is
just
another
mitigating
circumstance,
and
i
don't
think
that's
what
the
court
had
intended
in
eddings
when
it
said
that
juries
have
to
give
great
weight
to
mitigating...
youth
as
a
mitigating
circumstance.
it's...
it's
a
mitigating
circumstance
above
and
beyond
other
mitigating
statute...
circumstances
that
the...
the
states
might
proscribe.
we
would...
we
would
submit
that
it
is
constitutionally
acceptable
in
determining
evolving
standards
of
decency
to
utilize
18
as
the
age
barrier
for
capital
punishment
because
of
its
widespread
acceptance
as
the
dividing
line
between
childhood
and
adulthood.
in
exempting
persons
under
18
from
capital
punishment,
society
has...
the
court
would
be
making
a
determination
that
is
consistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
dividing
line
that
is
presently
in
place.
the
objective
factors
that
the
court
has
already
heard
in
the
prior
arguments
support
the
petitioner's
conclusion.
only
six
states
at
the
present
time
set
the
minimum
age
of
capital
punishment
at
below
18.
twenty-six
states
and
the
district
of
columbia
preclude
the
execution
of
juveniles.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
there
are
12,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
moreover,
international
opinion
widely
rejects
the
execution
of
juveniles.
in
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
amnesty
international,
it
shows
overwhelming
support
for
18
as
the
minimum
age
for
capital
punishment.
in
the
chart
submitted
by
amnesty
international,
143
out
of
180
nations
rejected
capital
punishment
for
people
under
18.
that
seems--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--i...
i
believe
there
were
approximately
20,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
we
would
submit
that
considering
the
ethnic,
religious,
cultural,
social
and
political
differences
between
the
nations
of
the
world,
it
seems
a
particularly
strong,
particularly
objective
factor
in
determining
that
capital
punishment
should
be
found
unconstitutional
for
juveniles
in
this
country
because
that
age
barrier
that
has
been
erected
by
the
international
community
is
a
common
bond
that
transcends
all
of
the
differences
between
nations
of
the
world.
we
would
further
submit
that
18
is
the
most
justifiable
and
the
most
logical
line
that
the
court
can
draw.
children
evolve
into
adults.
the
maturation
process
is
a
gradual
one
which
gives
rise
to
significant
emotional,
intellectual
and
cognitive
development
which
extends
into
a
person's
20s.
thus,
we
cannot
say
with
a
degree
of
constitutional
certainty
or
reliability
required
in
capital
cases
that
a
juvenile,
a
person
under
18,
is
so
much
like
an
adult
that
it
is
permissible
to
subject
them
to
the
death
penalty.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
your
honor,
i...
i
think
it
makes
a
lot
of
sense
not
only
as
a
matter
of
social
policy,
but
of
a...
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
to
set
the
age
of...
of
18.
society
has
already
created
a
presumption
that
people
under
18...
they
are
not
adults.
they
have
not
evolved
into
adulthood.
the
maturation
process
has
run
its
course.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
there's
less
reason
i
think
to
reject
that
presumption
in
capital
punishment
because
it
seems
to
me
that
the
risk
of
any
error
in
a
capital
case
is
too
much.
if
one
juvenile
were
wrongly
executed
because
he
or
she
was
not...
or
erroneously
decided
to
be
mature,
that's
too
much
of
a
risk.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
we
have
less
perfection
certainly
when
juveniles
are
subjected
to
the
death
penalty.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
a
number
of
the
nations.
i'm
not
sure
of
the
exact
figures.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
allow
capital
punishment
at
all?
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
that's
correct,
but
i
couldn't
give
you
a
specific
figure.
juveniles
demonstrate
tremendous
pestilence.
they
have
a
substantial
capacity
for
change,
intellectual
development
and
emotional
growth.
that's
the
true
essence
of
adolescence.
thus,
when
a
juvenile
is
subjected
to
the
death
penalty,
our
society
cannot
be
absolutely
certain
in
terms
of
the
constitutional
reliability
of
imposing
capital
punishment
that
a
juvenile
is
so
irredeemable
or
has
so
much
evolved
into
an
adult
that
the
finished
product
of
that
childhood
is
what
is
being
subjected
to
capital
punishment.
neither
can
we...
we
be
certain
as
human
beings
that
the
level
of
maturity
experienced
by
a
particular
juvenile
or
exhibited
by
a
particular
juvenile
is
commensurate
with
that
of
an
adult.
there's
too
much
room
for
error.
society
presumes
by
its
extensive
regulations
of
the
lives
of
juveniles
that
they
are
an
unfinished
product
and
that
the
maturation
process
is
still
continuing.
juveniles
are
still
developing
as
persons.
they
are
simply...
and
for
that
reason
society
has
determined
that
they
are
not
capable
of
exercising
the
same
privileges
and
responsibilities
of
adults.
we
don't
expect
them
to
act
as
adults.
we
don't
treat
them
as
adults.
and
those
restrictions
are
a
manifestation
that
society
has
substantial
doubt
that
a
person
who
is
under
18
has
actually
evolved
into
an
adult
because
a
person
under
the
age
of
18
simply
has
not
lived
long
enough
for
society
to
be
certain
that
it
is
dealing
with
the
completed
individual
or
the
finished
product
of
the
maturation
process.
and
that's
consistent
with
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence
that
requires
the
court
to
consider
the
dignity
of
man
because
society
must
be
certain
if
capital
punishment
is
to
be
imposed
that
it
is
dealing
with
the
finished
product
of
the
maturation
process,
a
fully
evolved
and
mature
adult.
we
can't
reach
that
level
of
certainty
in
juvenile
cases
because
of
the
age
barrier
or
the...
the
dividing
line
between
childhood
and
adulthood.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
it's
a
factor
certainly
for
the
court
to
consider,
but
that
is
not
the
be
all
and
the
end
all.
that's
not
the
end
of
the
inquiry,
your
honor.
eighteen--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--no,
i'm
not
saying
it's
irrelevant,
your
honor.
it's
a
factor
that
the
court
has
identified
in
enmund
and
coker
that
it
has
to
consider.
but
the
court
also
noted
that
in
the
final
analysis,
the
determination
of
what's...
what
constitutes
evolving
standards
of
decency
under
the
eighth
amendment
is
for
the
court's
determination
guided
by
those
objective
factors.
eighteen
is
the...
as
the
minimum
age
for
capital
punishment
would...
would
unequivocally
resolve
doubt
in
the
favor
of
juveniles
and
eliminate
the
risk
that
a
juvenile
who
has
not
evolved
into
an
adult
is
subjected
to
capital
punishment.
as
far
as
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
is
concerned,
we
would
submit
that
it
has
no
deterrent
or...
or
retribution
value
to
people
under
18.
deterrence,
as
we
noted
in
our
brief,
is...
is
only
remotely
possible.
it's
only
a
remote
possibility
as
far
as
juveniles
are
concerned
because
of
the
present
approximately
2,200
members
or
inhabitants
of
our
country's
death
row,
only
just
barely
over
1
percent
are
juveniles.
but
the
reason
why
the
deterrence
rationale
is
inapplicable
to
juveniles
lies
beyond
mere
statistics
and
goes
to
what
is
the
essence--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
the
fact
that
there
are
so
few
juveniles
on
death
row
reflects
our
society's
reluctance
to
inflict
the
death
penalty
on
juveniles.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
that
point
goes
precisely
to
why
deterrence...
the
deterrence
rationale
is
inapplicable
to
juveniles,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
well,
it's...
it
seems
to
me
that
juveniles,
by
virtue
of
their
immaturity,
by
virtue
of
their
age,
inexperience
and
lack
of
judgment,
do
not
appreciate
the
long-term
consequences
of
their
action--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--in
the
same...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
well,
the...
the
statistics
in
and
of
themselves,
your
honor,
seem
to
me
to...
to
indicate
a
societal
response
that
juvenile
cases
are
viewed
differently
even
when
the
state
is
seeking
capital
punishment.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
that...
that
certainly
would
be
the
ideal,
your
honor,
but
we
don't
have
the
capability
at
this
point
of
making
that
type
of
statistical
analysis.
but
it
still
seems
to
me
significant
that
when
you
look
at
the...
the...
who
inhabits
our
death
rows
and
find
that
only
1
percent
of
that
population
are
juveniles,
that's...
i
think
that's
significant
in
and
of
itself.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
well,
i...
i
think...
my
answer
would
be
that,
as
far
as
the
deterrence
rationale
is
concerned,
that
applies
to
juveniles
again
because
the...
the
difference
in
their
emotional
and
intellectual
development
has
posed--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--that's
true
in
the
sense
that
i
think
the
statistics
reflect
society's
recognition
of
the
differences
between
juveniles
and
adults.
there
is
widespread
agreement
that
juveniles
are
less
mature
and
less
responsible
than
adults,
and
that's
the--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--there
are...
according
to
legal
defense
fund's
latest
publication,
death
row
l.s.a.,
there
are
31.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
there's
widespread
agreement--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--twenty-three
by
my
count,
your
honor.
the...
there
is...
there
are
five
16
year
olds,
two
15
year
olds
and
one
is
unknown.
widespread
agreement...
there
is
widespread
agreement
that
juveniles
are
less
mature
and
less
responsible
than
adults.
that
is
the
reason
why
society
has
undertaken
pervasive
control
and
regulation
of
the
juveniles
lives.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
your
honor,
i
would
separate
the...
i
would
not
categorize
juveniles
as
young
adults.
a
young
adult
i
would
categorize
as
someone
18
to
25,
and
i
think
our
society
recognizes
the
difference
between--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--as
far
as
acting
impulsively,
that...
that
is
trait
of
adolescence.
it's
a
trait
of
juvenile
conduct
and
behavior.
and
i
think
society--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--that...
first
of
all,
that's
the
essence
of
juvenile
conduct.
but
i
think
it
goes
beyond
just
simply
the
emotional
and
intellectual
development
of
juveniles--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--no.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
no,
i'm
not
arguing
that,
as
far
as
retribution
is
concerned,
that
society
does
not
have
the
right
to
expect
some
type
of--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--the
psychiatric
literature
that
we've
cited
in
our
brief
has
indicated
that
deterrence
does
not...
is
not
a...
is
not
applicable
to
juveniles
because
they
don't...
they
have
absolutely
no
fear
of
death.
they
don't...
they
have
no
fear
of
death
in
their
ordinary...
ordinary
lives.
it
has
no
deterrent
value
to
their
everyday
lives,
and
therefore
would
have
no
deterrence
to
criminal
conduct
because
of
the...
the
particular
makeup,
psychological
makeup,
of
juveniles.
and
i
think
that's
all
part
and
parcel
of
the
lack
of
maturity
so
that
an
individual
who
is
a
young
adult,
18
to
25,
has
had
an
opportunity
and
would
be
expected
to...
to
be
at
a
higher
level
of
maturity
than
someone
who's
17
or
under.
the
death
penalty
is
society's
ultimate
act
of
despair.
when
it
is
imposed
on
a
juvenile,
it
manifests
a
hopelessness
of
absolutely
no
possibility
of
change
and
development
which
is
fundamentally
inconsistent
with
the
true
essence
of
adolescence.
that
is
a
resiliency
which
is
reflected
in
continuous
growth,
development
and
maturation.
as
human
beings,
we
are
incapable
of
making
an
infallible
determination
that
a
person
under
18
is
so
much
like
an
adult
or
so
far
beyond
the
possibility
of
all
change
that
he
or
she
can
justifiably
be
subjected
to
the
death
penalty.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
i
think
that's
a--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--i
think
the
inquiry
has
to
be...
go
beyond
the
nature
of
the
crime,
whether
it
be
heinous,
atrocious
or
whatever,
and
look
to
the
individual.
and
in
this
particular
case,
there
was
a
finding
by
the
juvenile
judge
that
the
petitioner
was
amenable
to
treatment.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
i...
i
think
there
that
recognizes
the
distinction
between
juveniles
and
adult.
juveniles
as
i've
indicated
earlier,
have
a
tremendous
capacity
for
change.
change
is
expected.
it
evolves
through
the
maturation
process.
and
therefore
that
potential
for
change,
that
potential
for
rehabilitation
is
much
greater
in
juveniles.
and
therefore
there's
absolutely
less
reason
or
no
justification
for
imposing
the
death
penalty
on
them
at
such
a
young
and
tender
age.
for
purposes
of
the
eighth
amendment,
it
is
entirely
appropriate
for
the
court
to
set
18
as
the
minimum
age
for
the
imposition
of
capital
punishment
because
it
will
unequivocally
eliminate
the
possibility
of
executing
a
child
who
has
not
fully
matured
into
an
adult
or
who
does
not
possess
an
adult's
level
of
maturity,
emotional
and
intellectual
development
and
whose
moral
culpability
cannot,
therefore,
be
considered
commensurate
with
an
adult.
setting
18
as
the
minimum
age
for
capital
punishment--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
but
i
should
point
out--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--we
are
asking
the
court
to
draw
the
line
at
18,
your
honor,
yes,--
setting
18
as
the
minimum
age
for
capital
punishment
advances
the...
the
objectives
of
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence,
that
is,
confidence,
certainty
and
reliability
in
the
outcome
of
the
proceedings.
and
we,
therefore,
urge
the
court
to
rule
that
juveniles
under
the
age
of
18
cannot
be
executed.
thank
you.
