justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
there
has
to
be
an
element
of...
it...
it's
arbitrary
somewhere,
isn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
if
you
draw
a
bright
line,
it
has
to
be
arbitrary.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
day
before
he
attains
18
he
could
commit
his
crime
and
not
be
executed.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
if
he
did
it
the
day...
a
day
later,
he
might
be.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
can
he
drive--
--but
the
difference,
mr.
heft--
--can
he
drive
in
the
commonwealth?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
can
a
17
year
old
drive
in
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so,
they
haven't
drawn
it
there.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
course,
you're...
you're
arguing
for
365
days,
aren't
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
three
sixty-six
in
leaf
years.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that...
that...
that's
your
margin.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
general
cowan,
do
you
think...
is
it
your
view
that
thompson
v.
oklahoma
is
wrong?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
kentucky,
how
many
do
you
have
on
death
row
now?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
how
many
are
under
18?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
general,
may
i
get
back
to
my
other
question?
is
there
any
principal
way
in
which
we
can
decide
in
your
favor
here
and
keep
thompson
v.
oklahoma
on
the
books?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
what
about
16?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
can
they
drive
in
missouri
at
16?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
there's
no
distinction
there?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
certainly
50
years
ago
21
was
the
dividing
line
on
most
everything,
not
18.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
our
voting
age
case
gave
that
a
lot
of
impetus.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
missouri
what
is
the
age
for
service
on
a
jury?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
how
old
is
wilkins
now?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
twenty?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
how
many
executions
have
there
been
in
missouri
since
the
reinstallation
of
the
death
penalty?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
how
many
are
on
death
row?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it's
been
slow.
