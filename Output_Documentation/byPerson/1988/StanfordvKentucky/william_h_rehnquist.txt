chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
87-5765,
kevin
stanford
v.
kentucky.
mr.
heft,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
one
would
hope
maybe
even
longer
sometimes.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that...
that's
true,
mr.
heft,
with
respect
to
adults.
you'll
have
mitigating
evidence
come
in
as
to
adults,
and
there's
no
guarantee
that
the
jury
gave
it
any
particular
consideration.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
argument
goes
to
the
whole
concept
of
mitigating
circumstances
in
capital
cases.
it's
not
peculiar
to
juvenile
or
16
or
17
year
old
capital
defendants.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
asking
to
have
it
treated
categorically
in
saying
that
it
should
be
categorically
ruled
out.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
we
know
what
weight
the
jury
gives
to
any
mitigating
circumstance?
the...
you
can
say
that
about
any
capital
defendant
presumably
that
we
can't
be
sure
that...
just
how
the
jury
looked
at
this
particular
factor,
but
it's
not
peculiar
to
youth.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
does
that...
the
26
states
and
the
district
of
columbia...
does
that
include
some
states
which
preclude
the
execution
of
everybody?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
how
many
in
your
list
that
preclude
the
execution
of
juveniles
authorize
it
for
adults?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
it's
12
versus
what?
six?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
many
of
those
rejected
capital
punishment
totally?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
twenty
who
had
no
capital
punishment
at
all?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
the
statistics
prove
at
all
about
the
death
penalty
being
a
deterrent
to
juveniles?
that
there
are
only
i
percent
of
juveniles
on
death
row...
you
would
have
to
compare
that
to
other
universes
surely
to
get
anything
out
of
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
might
reflect
that,
or
it
might
reflect
the
fact
that
very...
a
much
smaller
percentage
of
juveniles
than
adults
commit
offenses
which
could
be
capital
crimes
in
the
first
place.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
explain
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that...
that's
certainly
an
argument
that
at
least
seems
to
move
in
that
direction.
but
i
don't
see
how
that
ties
to
the
statistics
at
all.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
wouldn't
you
have
to
compare
the
1
percent
with
the
number
of
juvenile
cases
in
which
capital
punishment
could
have
been
imposed
or
the
number...
the
universe
of
juvenile
offenders?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
say
the
same
thing
if
we
examined
death
row
and
found
that
only
1
percent
of
the
inhabitants
were
over
60,
that
the
death
penalty
really
doesn't
deter
people
who
are
over
60?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
it's
because
of
the
juvenile
nature
that
you're
talking
about,
not
because
of
the
statistics.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
heft.
general
cowan,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
cowan.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
87-6026,
heath
a.
wilkins
v.
missouri.
ms.
mckerrow,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
would
we
know
the
top
age
from
your
argument,
ms.
mckerrow?
is...
just
16
is
all
you
are
arguing
for,
but
would
it
be
whatever
age
minority
generally
ends
at
in
the
states?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
why
should
we
set
the
bright
line
at
18?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
suppose
the
states
come
along
and
raise
the
drinking
age
to
21
and
raise
a
whole
bunch
of
other
ages.
this
line,
this
bright
line,
would
then
move
to
21?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
resume
at
1:00.
thank
you,
ms.
mckerrow.
we'll
resume
where
we
left
off
before
lunch,
ms.
mckerrow.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
say
a
brief
was
filed
in
support
of
the
juvenile
judges
view
by
17
attorneys
general
of
states?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
see.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
society
rejects
it
and
yet
obviously
in
missouri
society
hasn't
rejected
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
appears
to
be
ready
to
permit
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
doesn't
it
speak
for
the
state?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
who
does
speak
for
the
state
on
a
question
like
this?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
say
it
simply...
it
passed
a
statute
dealing
with
the
death
penalty,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
has
obviously
interpreted
the
legislative
enactment
to
authorize
execution
of
people
under
18,
has
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
transfer
statute
in
missouri
automatic
at
age
16
or
just
discretionary
with
the
judge?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
fourteen?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
factors
does
he
have
to
take
into
consideration?
is
it
whether
the
other
facilities
are
over-crowded?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
mckerrow.
mr.
morris,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
apropos
of
the
question
put
from
the
bench
to
ms.
mckerrow,
one
would
expect,
if
these
polls
were
terribly
accurate
that
eventually
they
would
be
reflected
in
legislation,
would
one
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
morris.
ms.
mckerrow,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say
the
legislature
removed
it
without
consideration?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you're
not
saying
that
it
wasn't
considered
are
you?
are
you
saying
the
legislators
did
not
consider
whether
or
not
to
vote
yes
or
no?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
do
you
seek
to
demonstrate
by
that
point?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
don't
feel
the
missouri
legislature
dealt
with
it
in
the
process
you
just
described?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
justice
kennedy
had
a
question
for
you.
you
indicated
that
the
legislature
was
waiting
for
this
court's
guidance.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
mckerrow.
the
case
is
submitted.
