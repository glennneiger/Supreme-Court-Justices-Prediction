justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
widespread
agreement
that
as
a
result
of
that,
deterrence
is
irrelevant?
i
mean,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if...
if
a
young
adult
is...
is
impulsive
and
has
poor
judgment,
that
maybe
deterrence
is
more
important,
not
less.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right,
a
young
person.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
why
is
deterrence
less
relevant
when
you
have
an
impulsive
nature?
i...
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me...
but
you're
saying
that
juveniles
can
be
so
dangerous
that
therefore
we
shouldn't
have
the
ultimate
deterrent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
to
me
that
just
doesn't
follow.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we're
talking
about
deterrence.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there
any
scientific
studies
to
verify
that
people
at
that
age
17
are
not
amenable
to
treatment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
a
scientific
basis
that
you
can
have
a
hardened
criminal,
a
well-set
sociopathic
personality
at
the
age
of
17?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
none
has
been
cited
that
i
see.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
once
again,
have
there
been
any
psychological
studies
or
sociological
studies
that
bear
that
out,
or
are
you
asking
us
to
rely
on...
on
our...
on
our
own
judgment
and
our
own
knowledge?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
would
ask
the
same
question
about
the
deterrent
value
of
the
death
penalty
so
far
as
a
16
year
old
is
concerned
or
a
17
year
old.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
do
you
acknowledge
that
life
sentence
without
possibility
of
parole
is
constitutional
for
a
16-year-old?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
your
acknowledgement
that
a
life
sentence
is
constitutional
is
based
on
the
premise
that
it
is
possible
in
some
cases
to
determine
that
a
sociopathic
personality
cannot
be
corrected
even
at
the
age
of
16?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
is
your
concession
based
on
the
premise
that
a
life
sentence
is
a
necessary
deterrent
to
a
16-year-old?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
conceded
that
it
is
constitutional
to
imprison
a
16-year-old
for
life.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i'm
asking
you
if
it's
not
because
personality
adjustment
is
unlikely.
you
seem
to
reject
that.
is
it
because
it's
a
deterrent
and
a
16-year-old
can
be
deterred
by
a
life
sentence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
deterrent
value
of
either
a
life
sentence
or
a
death
sentence
is
something
that
a
16-year-old
can
understand?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course
that
shows
perhaps
that
juries
are
sensitive
to
this
and
there's
no
indication
that
they
weren't
sensitive
in
the
case
before
us.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
trial
court
was
perfectly
well
aware
of
this,
as
was
the
supreme
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
it
pass
either
house?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
he
originally
asked
for
the
death
penalty.
does
the
record
indicate
at
what
point
he
changed
his
mind?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
assume
he's
changed
his
mind
again
and
now
does
not
want
to
be
executed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
your
whole
argument
has
been
that
we're
supposed
to
take
our
guidance
from
the
legislature.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
see
some
circularity
there.
