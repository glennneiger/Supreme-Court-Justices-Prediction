mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
arguments
presented
in
petitioner's
brief
and
also
by
counsel
for
petitioner
today
resemble
in
some
respects
some
of
the
arguments
that
might
be
offered
to
a
legislature
in
deciding
whether
or
not
a
categorical
age
limitation
might
be
imposed.
but
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
this
court
is
presented
with
two
definite,
specific,
distinct
issues
in
deciding
whether
or
not
this
punishment
violates
categorically,
for
all
persons
at
the
age
of
16
when
they
commit
their
murder,
whether
it
violates
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
the
constitution.
the
first
of
those
questions
is
whether
this
court
can
find
an
objective
basis
that
there
is
a
national
consensus
in
opposition
to
the
execution
of
those
who
commit
murders
at
petitioner's
age...
in
other
words,
whether
this
practice
violates
the
evolving
standards
of
decency,
as
it's
been
described.
the
second
question
is
whether...
it's
been
variously
formulated,
but
i
understand
it
to
be
whether
this
punishment
is
categorically,
for
persons
of
this
class,
excessive
or
disproportionate
to
the
crime
committed
or
other
factors,
in
particular
factors
regarding
penological
justification,
whether
there
was
any
measurable
penological
justification
for
the
carrying
out
of
such
sentences.
on
the
first
of
these
questions,
i
submit
that
this
court's
search
for
objective
indicators
is
never
going
to
be
a
scientific
or
quantitative
sort
of
analysis,
if
for
no
other
reason
than
because
there
is
no
absolutely
and
invariably
reliable,
objective
indicator.
even
legislation,
which
this
court
has
most
frequently
cited,
is
not
always
going
to
reflect
the
views
of
the
public
for
the
simple
reason
that
legislators
don't
always
necessarily
vote
according
to
the
views
of
their
constituents.
they
may
and
in
many
cases
do
vote
the
views
of
their
own
convictions
or
many
other
factors,
and
i
submit
that
is
particularly
true
in
cases,
such
as
those
involving
capital
punishment,
which
involve
questions
of
deep
personal
conviction.
but
i
think
what
can
be
done
for
this
examination,
although
it
can't
be
made
scientific,
is
to
apply
the
greatest
rigor
possible
to
examining
these
so-called
objective
indicators
and
seeing
if
they
really
are
objective
and,
if
so,
why,
and
second
i
think
to
arrive
at
a
measure
of
consistency
in
what
one
deems
to
be
objective,
an
objective
indicator
of
public
views
and
what
is
not.
members
of
this
court
have
pointed
out
on
repeated
occasions
that
this
court,
just
from
the
nature
of
the
institution,
is
not
inherently
well
suited
to
judge
the
public
mind,
and
for
that
reason
i
think
the
greatest
possible
care
should
be
taken
in
this
examination.
beginning
with
the
subject
of
legislation,
i
would
respectfully
disagree
with
my
opposing
counsel.
the
number
of
states
which
would
permit
the
execution
of
those
of
petitioner's
age
is
not
18
but
22.
they
are
set
out
in
appendix
b
of
my
brief.
four
of
those
22
states
make
an
express
reference
in
their
capital
punishment
statutes
to
the
question
of
age.
three
of
those
set
a
categorical
floor
of
age
16.
the
fourth
sets
a
general
age
of
17,
but
allows
for
specific
exception
to
that.
now
judging
from
this
court's
opinions
in
thompson
v.
oklahoma
it
would
seem
that
there
would
seem
to
be
basic
consensus
that
these
statutes
in
which
the
age
is
referred
to
in
the
capital
punishment
statutes
are
objective
indicators
of
public
view.
it
would
seem
that
the
dispute
comes
in
those
remaining
18
jurisdictions,
including
missouri,
which
have
a
juvenile
transfer
statute,
a
juvenile
statute
which
sets
a
minimum
age
for
prosecution,
and
that
minimum
age
also
serves
as
the
age
for
execution.
the
question
as
i
would
see
it
presented
in
thompson
is,
can
this
court
disregard
those
18
jurisdictions
in
judging
evolving
standards
of
decency
on
the
theory
that
the
legislatures
in
those
states
just
simply
didn't
think
about
the
subject
of
capital
punishment
when
they
passed
those
laws.
now
i
submit
the
question...
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no
for
three
reasons.
first
of
all,
we
have
specific
evidence
on
the
face
of
some
of
these
statutes...
five
of
the
18,
to
be
exact...
in
which
references
are
made
in
the
juvenile
statutes
which
we're
examining
either
to
capital
punishment
or
to
that
state's
version
of
capital
murder.
i
cited
a
particular
pronounced
example
in
my
brief
at
pages
23
and
24,
the
georgia...
pardon
me,
the
florida
juvenile
statute,
which
is
rife
with
references
to
the
fact
that
a
juvenile
can
receive
the
death
penalty.
i
think
it's
awfully
difficult
to
justify
in
the
face
of
that
evidence
alone
a
proposition
that
one
could
ignore
these
juvenile
statutes
as
a
whole
because
the
legislature
just
didn't
think
about
this
question.
in
addition
to
that
and
apart
from
that
i
would
offer
additional
evidence,
which
is
admittedly
less
direct,
which
is
the
fact
that
the
vast
majority
of
these
legislatures,
the
18
juvenile
states
we're
dealing
with,
14
of
the
18,
have
passed
statutes
in
their
capital
punishment
provisions
which
expressly
recognize
the
importance
of
a
connection
between
the
defendant's
age
as
a
mitigating
factor
in
capital
punishment.
now
i
concede
that
none
of
these
statutes
make
a
reference
to
juvenile
laws.
i've
never
contended
otherwise.
but
what
i
am
saying
is
what
we
are
encountering
here
is
petitioner's
desire
to
assume
that
the
same
connection
between
age
and
capital
punishment
was
not
made
when
the
legislature
passed
their
juvenile
laws.
and
i
submit
that
that
is
at
least
a
circumstantial
indication
that
they
made
the
same
connection
there.
a
second
major
reason
why
these
18
jurisdictions
should
not
be
overlooked
in
considering
evolving
standards
of
decency
is
that
we
have
not
just
evidence
of
legislative
contemplation
of
this
subject,
which
i
have
mentioned
already,
but
also
actual
exposure
of
the
public
to
this
issue.
the
sentencing
of
persons
to
death
at
petitioner's
age
is
not
an
academic
consideration
in
this
country.
since
1982
there
have
been
15
persons
of
that
age
sentenced
to
death
in
this
country,
of
which
eight
were
in
jurisdictions
with
these
juvenile
statutes.
i
think
this
court
has
acknowledged
and
should
acknowledge
that
the
acts
of
legislators
reflect
their
public
as
a
general
proposition,
and
i
would
submit
that
that
phenomenon
cannot
be
deemed
to
have
ceased
once
a
law
is
passed.
if
there
is
a
law
on
the
books
which,
in
the
words
of
the
plurality
in
thompson,
"is
abhorrent
to
the
conscience
of
the
community.
"
i
would
suggest
that
a
reasonable
conclusion
exists
that
that
law
is
not
going
to
be
on
the
books
very
long.
yet...
and
i've
cited
in
my
brief,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
examples
in
which
when
a
person
of
young
age,
and
specifically
age
15,
has
been
sentenced
to
death
in
states
and
there
have
been
repeated
occasions
when,
very
quickly
in
some
cases,
there
has
been
adjustment
upward
of
the
minimum
age
in
that
state.
indiana,
for
example,
sentenced
a
15-year-old
woman
to
death,
and
less
than
a
year
after
that
sentence
that
legislature
passed
a
law
setting
the
minimum
age
at
16.
but
when
you
look
at
these
eight
states,
not
only
of
these
states
with
actual
experience
in
sentencing
individuals
of
this
age
to
death
has
made
any
change
to
its
minimum
age
during
the
period
i've
been
talking
about,
since
1982.
again,
it
is
not
direct
evidence,
but
i
submit
that
it
is
one
more
basis
for
saying
that
we
can't...
we
cannot
presume,
as
petitioner
desires
that
we
presume,
that
these
statutes
are
simply
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
public
views.
finally,
i
would
suggest
that
it
is
simply
counter-intuitive
to
presume
that
a
legislature
which
passed
a
law
which
subjected
juveniles
to
all
adult
criminal
penalties
somehow
didn't
contemplate
that
the
death
penalty
was
one
of
those
penalties.
now
it's
true,
as
was
stated
by
justice
o'connor
in
the
concurrence
of
thompson,
that
there
could
be
many
reasons
apart
from
the
death
penalty
why
a
particular
minimum
prosecution
age
might
be
set.
but
if
that
is
the
case,
and
unless
the
legislature
is
oblivious
to
the
question
of
capital
punishment,
there
are
many
ways
the
legislature
can
take
that
fact
into
account,
either
by
adjusting
the
prosecution
age
or
by
setting
a
separate
capital
punishment
age,
as
some
states
have
done.
but
i
submit
that
in
order
to
assume
that
legislatures
just
didn't
think
about
this
thing
you
must,
as
a
necessary
inference,
assure
that
the
legislature
didn't
even
know
they
had
a
capital
punishment
statute.
and
i
submit
that
that
is
not
a
tenable
or
reasonable
assumption.
for
all
of
these
reasons,
the
respondent
submits
that
the
dominant
fact
when
we
are
reviewing
the
question
of
public
views
in
this
country
on
this
subject
is
that
22
of
the
36
states
in
this
country
which
have
a
death
penalty
statute
have
authorized
the
sentence
of
death
in
the
situation
in
which
petitioner
finds
himself,
for
capital
murders
committed
at
age
16.
i
submit
that
even
apart
from
the
other
factors
which
i
will
proceed
to
discuss
that
on
its
face
demonstrates
an
absence
of
a
national
consensus
in
opposition
to
that
punishment.
i
think
it's
a
measure
of
the
inconsistency
of
petitioner's
position
that
petitioner
attempts,
while
ignoring
these
18
states
which
address
this
particular
subject,
attempts
to
rely
upon
statutes
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
subject
of
capital
punishment
or
even
criminal
prosecution,
for
that
matter,
and
i'm
referring
specifically
to
the
voting
and
drinking
and
driving
and
so
forth
ages.
what
i
would
say
about
those
statutes
are
two
things.
first
of
all,
they
pertain
to
what
they
pertain.
there
are
ages
ranges
in
every
state.
in
missouri
there
are
age
ranges
all
the
way
from
10
to
21
for
different
activities.
how
does
one
possibly
select
one
of
those
ages
or
one
of
those
statutes
and
say
that
that
statute
has
some
pertinence
to
what
the
public
feels
about
capital
punishment?
i
submit
that
that
connection
is
simply
not
makable.
even
if...
even
aside
from
that,
there
is
the
fact
that
these
statutes
that
petitioner
is
talking
about
are
basically
different
in
character
from
the
kind
of
statutes
we're
dealing
with
in
these
cases.
in
capital
punishment
statutes
and
as
a
general
principle
in
juvenile
statutes,
we
are
dealing
with
an
individualized
consideration
of
the
particular
person
at
issue.
we
are
dealing
with
a
weighing
of
aggregating
versus
mitigating
factors
or
the
factors
that
the
juvenile
statutes
prescribe
which
require
consideration
of
various
aspects
of
the
youth
in
deciding
whether
he
should
be
treated...
whether
or
not
he
should
be
treated
as
an
adult.
that
is
not
true
of
any
of
the
statutes
petitioner
cites.
they
are
class
statutes.
and
inasmuch
as
we
are
already
conducting
in
[inaudible]
into
these
individuals,
i
don't
see
the
relevance
of
class
statutes
in
determining
objective
public
standards
of
decency.
i
don't
propose
to
go
through
and
discuss
each
and
every
one
of
the
purportedly
objective
factors
cited
by
petitioner,
but
i
would
like
to
say
a
few
words
about
jury
verdicts.
in
this
court's
decisions
of
furman,
and
gregg,
and
coker,
this
court
had
before
it
some
evidence
not
just
of
the
pure
number
of
those
sentenced
to
the
punishment
which
was
being
challenged
but
also
the
proportion
of
that
number
to
the
occasions
on
which
this
sentence
was
being
sought.
for
example,
in
gregg
v.
georgia,
justice
stewart
mentioned
in
his
plurality
opinion
that
this
court
had
before
it
indications
that
of
those
cases
in
which
a
person
was
convicted
of
murder
less
than
20
percent
were
sentenced
to
death,
and
this
figure
was
discussed
as
to
whether
it
was
relevant
in
indicating
public
views
in
support
or
opposition
to
capital
punishment.
after
coker,
beginning
in
enmund,
we
begin
to
see
for
the
first
time
a
reference
to
the
raw
number
of
those
cases
in
which
persons
are
sentenced
to
death
for
the
class
challenged
as
if
that
number
on
its
face
has
some
significance,
and
i
submit
that
that
is
not
the
case.
i
think
a
good
illustration
comes
from
the
facts
of
this
case.
again,
since
1982
there
have
been
15
persons
in
this
country
of
petitioner's
age,
including
petitioner,
who
have
been
sentenced
to
death.
now
if
that
number
comes
from,
let's
say,
200
trials
in
which
people
of
this
age
were
convicted
of
a
capital
crime
in
which
the
death
penalty
was
sought,
then
perhaps
it
certainly
could
be
argued
that
there
is
a
disproportionate
reluctance
on
the
part
of
sentencers
to
return
a
death
sentence
for
people
of
petitioner's
age.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
that
number
is
15
out
of
30
trials,
then
i
don't
think
that
argument
can
be
tenably
made
at
all.
petitioner
has
offered
no
evidence
of
the
opportunity
of
sentencers
to
consider
this
question.
i
have
no
figures.
the
only
figures
i
have
been
able
to
offer
concern
missouri,
and
in
the
last
12
years
that
missouri
has
had
an
operating
death
penalty
we've
had
138
cases
in
which
the
death
penalty
has
been
sought
after
a
conviction
of
capital
murder,
and
only
three
of
those
involved
persons
of
petitioner's
age
or
younger.
now
i
don't
know
if
that
can
be
extrapolated
to
other
states
or
not,
but
if
it
can
it
might
go
a
long
way
to
explain
why
the
number
of
those
under
sentence
at
petitioner's
age
is
not
very
high
and
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
proposition
that
those
sentencers
who
consider
the
crimes
committed
by
those
of
petitioner's
age
are
reluctant
to
impose
that
penalty.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
one,
your
honor.
it
was
this
january.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
approximately
70,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
yes,
it
has,
your
honor.
yes,
it
has
been
very
slow.
aside
from
this
problem
in
proof,
i
would
also
submit
and
i
think
members
of
this
court
have
pointed
out
that
it
does
not
follow,
even
if
he
could
show
a
disproportionate
reluctance
of
sentencers
to
consider
or
to
impose
sentences
of
death
upon
those
petitioner's
age,
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
that
is
not
necessarily
an
indication
that
there
is
an
abhorrence
or
a
consensus
in
opposition
to
this
penalty.
as
i
pointed
out,
virtually
every
state
in
this
country
with
a
death
penalty
has
recognized
in
its
statute
the
importance
of
the
defendant's
age
as
a
possible
mitigating
factor,
and
if,
as
seems
eminently
reasonable,
the
younger
the
defendant,
the
more
important
that
factor,
that
also
would
explain
such
a
disproportion
and
would
have,
again,
nothing
to
do
with
the
proposition
that
there
is
a
national
consensus
against
this
penalty.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
there
is...
indeed,
last
november
was
passed
the
anti-drug
abuse
act
of
1988,
and
it
does
include
a
minimum
age
of
18.
as
has
been
pointed
out
in
thompson,
there
are
a
number
of
other
death
penalty
statutes
in
the
federal
jurisdiction,
and
it's
awfully
hard
to
know
how
or
where
the
federal
jurisdiction
stands
in
that
situation.
at
least
in
the
states
we
have
one
death
penalty
statute
or
we
don't
have
one.
it
was
discussed
and
argued
in
thompson,
of
course,
in
the
various
opinions
that
this
either
has
a
general
implication
or
it
just
has
a
narrow
implication
to
the
sort
of
crime
that
was
being
passed,
and
i
can't
disprove
or
prove
either
of
those
propositions.
that
is
the
reason
i've
sort
of
set
aside
the
federal
jurisdiction
as
just
being
one
of
the
legislature.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
well,
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
not
sure
that
the
particular
acts
which
are
covered
focus
on
young
offenders
or
there
are
a
lot
of
young
offenders
in
that
category,
because
the
crime,
as
it's
set
out,
involves
conspiracies
and
plots
to
kill
law
enforcement
officers
and
i
believe
there's
also
sort
of
a
general
in
the
commission
of
drug
offenses.
i
don't
think
it
follows
or
i
wouldn't
have
any
indication
as
to
whether
there
are
a
large
percentage
of
young
offenders
doing
that
sort
of
thing.
there
certainly
are
a
lot
of
young
offenders
in
drug
offenses;
i
agree
with
you.
i
submit
that
if
there
is
no
basis
for
excluding
the
possibilities
that
i've
mentioned...
and
particularly
the
possibility
that
of
the
relatively
small
number
of
those
sentenced
to
death
at
petitioner's
age
is
simply
an
expression
of
the
reluctance
to
sentence
people
this
age
to
death...
we
shouldn't
be
relying
upon
this
as
an
objective
indicator
of
public
views.
if
there
is
not
even
intuitive
basis
for
excluding
that
possibility,
then
i
submit
it
should
not
be
relied
upon.
contrary
to
petitioner's
reply
brief,
i
don't
suggest
the
only
factor
for
this
court
to
consider
is
legislation.
i
think
other
factors
such
as
polls
might
be
useful,
although
it
is
awfully
hard
to
tell...
i'm
not
sure
i
can
say...
how
one
can
characterize
a
national
consensus
in
terms
of
percentages.
i'm
not
sure
it
can
be
done.
but
i
do
think
polls
might
be
useful
as
a
secondary
indictor
is
one
has
evidence
separately
of
a
consensus
either
to
support
or--
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
--yes,
your
honor,
they
would.
and
it's
also
true
that
if
there
is
a
public
abhorrence
of
this
there
is
no
point
in
my
being
here
or
making
this
argument,
because
eventually
that
will
be
the
law
anyway.
and
i
might
mention
in
that
connection
that
since
this
case
has
been
granted
there
was
legislation
offered
in
missouri
to
make
it
a
minimum
age
of
18
and
it
was
not
passed.
so
perhaps
that's
one
example
of
that.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
they
tried
to
make
it
part
of
a
bill
and
it
was
defeated,
as
it
was
removed
from
that
bill.
but
it
was
a
categorical
limitation
at
age
18
and
it
is
not
going
to
become
law.
but,
your
honor,
yes,
if
there
is
a
national
abhorrence
as
reflected
in
polls,
yes,
it
certainly
should
be
indicated
by
other
indications,
and
also
mainly
in
the
legislature.
i
also
think
such
things
as
treaties
can
be
relevance
if
they
are
ratified,
for
the
same
reason
as
legislation
is
relevant.
but
what
i
think
we
cannot
do
and
what
petitioner,
i
believe,
has
done
is
to
author
a
raft
of
so-called
objective
indicators
without
any
stringent
effort
to
consider
whether
they
really
are
objective.
justice
powell,
in
his
opinion
in
furman,
i
believe,
quoted
justice
holmes
in
a
previous
case
as
saying
the
most
delicate
and
grave
task
this
court
has
to
undertake
is
to
review
legislative
choices
of
a
legislature.
and
i
subject
it
is
doubly
grave
and
delicate,
whereas
there
this
court
is
required
under
its
cases
to
arrive
at
a
view
of
the
national
mind
in
deriving
constitutional
policy.
and
i
submit
that
that
sort
of
activity
requires
the
most
stringent
care
in
determining
that
there
really...
the
test,
the
objective
factors
that
this
court
is
relying
on
really
are
objective.
if
there
isn't
a
national
consensus
against
the
execution
of
those
of
petitioner's
age,
that
of
course
does
not
end
the
matter.
this
court
has
said
in
its
cases
that
even
publicly
approved
punishments
may
be
deemed
to
violate
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments
if
they
are
essentially
excessive
and
disproportionate.
in
cases
involving
the
facts
of
the
crime,
this
court
has
used
that
to
derive
qualitative
distinctions
between
those
sorts
of
activities
which
are
proportionate
for
the
death
penalty
and
those
which
aren't.
but
this
case,
like
thompson,
is
not
one
of
those
cases.
it
is
a
case
in
which
we
are
dealing
exclusively
with
characteristics
of
a
defendant.
and
i
submit
to
this
court
that
in
that
context
and
that
context
alone
this
proportionality
analysis
is
virtually
unworkable.
defendants
are
sentenced
to
death
because
of
what
they
did,
not
because
of
what
they
are.
now
what
they
are,
the
kind
of
person
they
are,
the
kind
of
history
they've
had,
is
relevant
to
show
why
they
did
what
they
did
and
their
culpability
in
doing
what
they've
done.
but
the
core
decision
in
sentencing
is
to
consider
what
a
person
has
done
and
his
culpability
in
doing
it.
the
decision
as
to
what
kind
of
person
he
is
is
one
removed
from
that.
to
give
an
illustration
from
this
case,
under
missouri
law
in
order
to
be
found
guilty
of
first-degree
murder
one
must
act
with
deliberation.
there,
incidentally,
is
no
felony
murder
which
is
a
capital
offense
in
missouri.
felony
murder
is
not
a
capital
offense.
you
must
act
with
deliberation,
which
is
defined
in
missouri
law
as
coolly
reflecting
for
some
time
in
advance
upon
the
murder.
but
when
petitioner
focuses
upon
not
the
facts
of
the
crime
or
the
elements
of
the
crime
but
upon
the
character
of
the
defendant
these
facts
sort
of
get
moved
away
and
not
considered.
part
of
petitioner's
argument,
it
seems
to
me,
is
in
essence
that
heath
wilkins
didn't
deliberate.
heath
wilkins
is
a
youth
and
is
impulsive.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
no,
your
honor,
we
don't.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
no,
your
honor.
pardon
me.
if
i
said
that,
i
don't
mean
to
be
interpreted
as
saying
that,
no.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
i'm
sorry.
let
me
clarify
that
since
it's
come
up.
i
am
saying
that
the
character
of
the
defendant
is
relevant,
but
it
is
collaterally
relevant
and
it
mainly
pertains
to
the
kind
of
crime
it
is,
to
explain
whether
he
is
culpable,
how
culpable
he
is.
you
don't
sentence
someone
to
death
because
he
is
a
nice
person
or
a
bad
person.
you
sentence
him
because
he
has
committed
a
murder
and,
incidentally,
he
did
so
out
of
full
awareness
of
what's
going
on
and
knowledge
of
the
consequences,
or
didn't,
for
that
matter.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
no,
your
honor.
in
fact,
i'm
saying
the
contrary,
i'm
saying--
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
--not
in
a
mechanical
sense,
but
i'm
saying
that
the
ultimate
question
is,
is
what
did
he
do
and
how
culpable
was
he
in
doing
it.
and
certainly
it
is
relevant--
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
--unquestionably,
your
honor.
absolutely.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
i'm
not
disputing
that,
your
honor.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
center
of
the
sentencing
decision
is
what
he
did
and
why
he
did
it,
which
includes
his
youth
or
any
other
mitigating
factors
one
may
consider.
but
the
center
of
the
decision
is
that
and
not
just
what
sort
of
person
he
happens
to
be.
when
this
court--
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
--yes,
your
honor.
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
that
can
be
derived
and
must
be
derived
from
this
court's
public
views
determination.
in
lieu
of
a
question
or
perhaps
not
even
a
question,
i
think
if
one
examines
such
factors
again
as
legislation,
i
think
that
figure
can
be
identified
as
somewhere
between
13
and
14
because
at
age
13
we
have
only
three
states
in
this
country
which
expressly
authorize
sentencing
to
death
of
a
person
that
age,
which
puts
us,
it
seems
to
me,
in
the
ballpark
of
coker.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
some
of
these
statutes...
at
age
13
all
of
the
statutes
are
juvenile
statutes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
at
age
14
the
number
goes
up
substantially,
i
think
to
nine
or
something
like
that.
but
i
think,
the
only
way
that
number
can
be
determined
is
what
i'm
saying,
is
through
the
public
views
sort
of
analysis.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
no,
your
honor.
that's
really
all
i
had
to
work
with,
because,
you
know,
when
we're
cooling
with
persons
13
or
14
there
hasn't
been
an
execution
in
those
cases
in
half
a
century.
there
are
no
one
on
death
row
that
age.
so
the
younger
the
age
becomes
in
this
analysis
the
most
difficult
it
is
to
deal
with
because
it
is
to
thoroughly
hypothetical.
the
only
persons
on
death
row
in
this
country
now
are,
at
the
youngest,
age
15
and
that
of
course
is
in
question
now
because
of
thompson.
what
i'm
really
saying,
i'm
not
again
intending
to
say
that
the
characteristics
of
the
defendant
are
not
relevant,
but
i'm
saying
when
this
court
makes
a
distinction
based
upon
the
crime
it
is
doing
something,
especially
when
it
makes
a
distinction
based
upon
the
elements
of
intent,
such
as
it
did
in
enmund,
it
is
again
addressing
the
core
of
the
sentencing
decision.
again,
an
example
from
this
case.
i
mentioned
that
heath
wilkins
acted
with,
was
found
to
have
acted
with
deliberation.
when
you
ignore
the
details
of
the
crime
and
the
elements
that
must
be
proven
in
a
crime,
you
are
left
with
the
sort
of
generalizations
the
petitioner
offers
here.
how
can
it
be
said...
and
i
submit
it
can't
be
said...
that
there
is
no
16-year-old
who
cannot
be
deterred
by
the
death
penalty?
heath
wilkins
conducted
a
thoroughly
rational
and
vicious
risk-benefit
analysis
in
this
case.
he
decided
in
advance
that
he
was
going
to
kill
someone,
and
he
carried
out
that
plan
with
considerable
rationality.
he
decided
in
effect
that
killing
nancy
allen
was
a
good
bet
for
him
because
he
would
raise
his
chances
of
not
being
apprehended.
i
submit
it
also
cannot
be
said
that
there
is
no
16-year-old,
perhaps
many
16-year-old,
who
would
not
act
with
such
awareness
as
to...
for
whom
the
principal
retribution
would
not
apply.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
he
was
caught,
confessed,
and
he
had
not
made
this
decision
at
what
time.
in
fact,
he
said
he
was
trying
to
play
crazy
at
that
time.
but
then
probably
a
month
or
so
later
he
was
being
given
psychiatric
evaluations
and
between
one
and
the
other
he
made
this
decision.
so
it
wasn't
right
after
his
arrest
but
it
was
at
a
somewhat
later
time.
mr.
john
m.
morris,
iii
well,
your
honor,
all
i
have
is
his
signature
on
the
formal
pauper's
form.
he
does,
incidentally,
have
a
state
post-conviction
proceeding
pending
as
well.
so
i
guess
there
are
some
inferences
in
that,
yes.
but
petitioner
really
doesn't
try
to
prove
that
there
are
no
people
of
this
age
for
which
retribution
or
deterrence
applies.
petitioner
applies
what
i
would
suggest
is
the
meat-ax
approach.
we
might...
there
might
be
a
lot
of
people
of
this
age
who
might
not
be
sufficiently
culpable
and
therefore
we
should,
as
a
matter
of
proportionality
analysis,
say
that
no
person
of
this
age
should
be
executed.
well,
your
honors,
i
submit
that
that
is
not
a
proportionality
analysis.
that
is,
if
anything,
social
engineering
and
i
really
submit
that
a
reasoning
of
that
character
really
has
no
place
in
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
thank
you.
