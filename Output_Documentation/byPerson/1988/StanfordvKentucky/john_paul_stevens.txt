mr.
heft,
but
on
the
statistics,
what
again
is
the
figure?
it's
1
percent
of
the
2,200,
so
there
are
about
24
or
25.
how
many...
how
many
juveniles?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thirty-one
is
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
you
one
other
question?
your
entire
argument
has
been
based
on
the
national
consensus
aspect
of
the
analysis.
do
you
think
that
is
the
only
test
by
which
the
court
should
judge
whether
punishment
is
cruel
and
unusual?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
did
the
court
use
the
national
consensus
approach
prior
to
the
capital
punishment
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
the
court
use
this
national
consensus
approach
prior
to
the
capital
punishment
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
suppose
prior
to
this...
this
national
consensus
approach,
what
principal
basis
would
there
have
been
for
putting
content
into
these...
this
part
of
the
constitution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
do
you
think
there
is
anything?
it's
strictly
a
matter
of
gallup
polls
and
the
like.
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
morris,
your
opponent
mentioned
the
federal
statute
as
a
new
development.
do
you
want
to
comment
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
in
the
area
that's
covered,
it's
a
narcotics
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
that's
an
area
in
which
deterrence
might
be
particular
effective,
because
there
are
a
lot
of
young
offenders
in
that
type
of
criminal
activity,
aren't
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
understand.
are
you
saying...
perhaps
it's
the
same
thing
justice
marshall
asked
that
the
particular
character
of
the
offender
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
degree
of
culpability?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
keep
referring
back
to
elements
of
the
offense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
on
that
very
question
wouldn't
you
say
that
youth
is
at
least
a
mitigating
factor?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
then
youth
does
have
something
to
do
with
the
culpability.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
would
agree...
i
assume
everybody
had
agreed...
that
there
is
an
age
below
which
you
would
say
there
can't
be
sufficient
culpability?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
through
the
juvenile
system?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
we
could
reach
that
conclusion
even
if
there
weren't
any
such
statutes
out
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
we
could
reach
the
conclusion,
that
conclusion
that
12
or
13
is
too
young,
even
if
there
were
no
such
statutes
out
there?
you
think
that
rests
entirely
on
the
existence
of
those
statutes?
