ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
heath
wilkins,
acting
pro
se,
pleaded
guilty
to
having
murdered
nancy
allen
during
a
robbery
of
a
liquor
store
dell
in
clay
county,
missouri,
on
july
27,
1985.
at
that
time
heath
wilkins
was
16
years
old.
approximately
one
year
later,
after
a
sentencing
hearing
at
which
both
heath
wilkins
and
the
prosecuting
attorney
recommended
the
sentence
of
death,
heath
was
in
fact
sentenced
to
death.
his
sentence
and
conviction
were
affirmed
by
the
missouri
supreme
court
on
september
15,
1987.
the
question
raised
in
this
court
is
whether
or
not
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
on
one
who
committed
his
or
her
crime
at
the
age
of
16
violates
the
cruel
and
unusual
clause
of
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
the
united
states
constitution.
the
answer
is
yes.
given
the
well-recognized
and
fundamental
differences
between
children
and
adults,
the
imposition
of
a
death
sentence
on
someone
who
committed
a
crime
at
the
age
of
16
would
always
offend
our
current
and
evolving
standards
of
decency
and
would
constitute
excessive
punishment
since
it
would
provide
no
measurable
benefit
to
society.
under
any
accepted
set
of
rules
or
standards,
children
are
not
small
adults.
while
the
varying
maturity
levels
of
the
class
of
16-year-olds
is
presented
to
the
court
in
the
briefs
and
the
court
may
certainly
consider
that
in
rendering
a
decision,
for
purposes
of
this
argument
petitioner
is
willing
to
assume
that
we
are
discussing
only
the
most
mature
16-year-olds,
because
even
the
most
mature
16-year-old
is
still
a
child
in
every
state
in
the
united
states
and
we
as
a
society
treat
children
differently
than
we
do
adults
in
virtually
every
area
of
life.
the
people
of
missouri
have
certainly
recognized
that
children
are
different,
and
speaking
through
their
elected
representatives
they
have
passed
more
than
80
statutes
restricting
the
rights
and
responsibilities
of
children
based
solely
on
the
dates
of
their
birth.
thus,
in
missouri
a
16-year-old
child,
no
matter
how
mature
he
or
she
may
be,
is
ineligible
to
vote,
to
serve
on
a
jury,
or
to
control
his
own
business
affairs
or
money.
the
people
of
missouri
have
also
recognized
that
children
are--
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
--yes,
your
honor,
they
may.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
no,
your
honor.
the
people
of
missouri
have
also
recognized
that
children
are
in
need
of
the
kind
of
care,
protection
and
control
that
could
never
be
extended
to
adults.
thus,
in
missouri
a
16-year-old,
no
matter
how
mature
he
may
be,
can
be
forced
to
attend
school.
if
he
works,
he
can
be
forced
to
turn
his
earnings
over
to
a
parent
or
guardian,
he
can
be
denied
entry
into
pool
halls
or
other
places
of
public
entertainment.
a
16-year-old
can
be
taken
into
custody
for
being
promiscuous
or
incorrigible
or
if
he
runs
away
from
intolerable
living
conditions,
and,
if
an
adult
decides
it's
in
his
own
best
interest,
he
can
be
forced
to
return
to
those
intolerable
living
conditions.
the
people
of
missouri
have
also
spoken
at
least
tangentially
on
the
issue
of
children
and
the
death
penalty.
a
16-year-old
child
in
missouri,
no
matter
how
mature
he
may
be,
is
considered
too
young
and
impressionable
to
witness
an
execution.
as
a
plurality
of
this
court
noted
in
thompson
versus
oklahoma
last
year,
it
would
be
truly
ironic
if
the
assumptions
we
so
readily
make
about
children
as
a
class,
the
assumptions
which
provide
the
justification
for
each
of
missouri's
80
age-based
statutes,
were
suddenly
unavailable
in
determining
whether
it
constitutes
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
to
treat
children
as
if
they
were
adults
for
purposes
of
inflicting
society's
ultimate
punishment.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
your
honor,
i
think
the
determination
that
a
particular
child
needs
or
deserves
confinement
for
lengthy
periods
of
time
is
something
that
could
be
left
to
the
states,
but
doesn't
really
address
the
issue
of
how
young
is
too
young
to
be
executed.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
every
state
has--
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
--when
the
punishment
is
terms
of
imprisonment,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
yes,
your
honor.
if
the
court
determines
that
he
is
guilty
of
first-degree
murder
in
missouri,
then
he
can
be
sentenced
to
life
without
possibility
of
probation
or
parole.
the
distinction
is
the
distinction
between
the
death
penalty
and
every
other
punishment
available
to
the
state,
your
honor,
and
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
death
penalty
is
a
unique
punishment,
and
it's
the
one
that
as
a
society
we
reserve
for
the
most
extreme
cases.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
i
don't
know
that
i
would
concede
that,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
if
that's
the
determination
that's
made.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
in
missouri
there
are
only
two
alternatives
once
an
offender
has
been
found
guilty
of
first-degree
murder,
and
that
is
life
without
probation
or
parole
or
the
death
penalty.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
this
case
illustrates
that.
heath
wilkins
pleaded
guilty
and
asked
to
be
sentenced
to
death.
he
saw
life
imprisonment
as
much
more
of
a
deterrent
for
his
conduct
than
he
does
or
did
the
death
penalty.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
i
think
when
you're
talking
about
deterrents
for
the
class
of
16-year-olds
that
life
in
prison
probably
provides
a
much
better
deterrence
than
would
a
potential
death
sentence.
if
the
concern
of
the
court
is
to
avoid
the
appearance
of
subjectivity
or
judicial
law-making,
then
the
action
to
be
taken
is
clear.
simply
bring
death
penalty
law
within
the
well-established
american
tradition
of
treating
children
differently.
there
is
no
basis
in
law
or
logic
for
abandoning
the
deferential
treatment
of
children
when
it
comes
to
the
imposition
of
the
death
sentence.
all
of
the
objective
indicators--
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
it
goes
back
again
to
the
real
distinction
between
the
death
penalty
and
every
other
punishment,
including
life
without
probation
or
parole,
which
doesn't
irrevocably
eliminate
the
possibility
for
change
in
a
16-year-old,
even
it
that
change
takes
place
in
a
confined
setting.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
your
honor,
we've
argued
for
the
age
limit
of
17
because
heath
wilkin's
was
16
at
the
time
of
his
offense,
and
therefore
we're
arguing
this
case.
however,
petitioner
would
agree
with
all
of
the
amicus
briefs
that
have
been
filed
and
with
petitioner
in
stanford
that
18
is
the
more
legitimate
age
at
which
to
set
this
bright
line.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
because
when
the
court
looks
at
the
objective
indicia
of
society's
attitudes,
18
is
the
one
age
that
has
the
most
to
commend
it
in
terms
of
that's
the
age
that
is
most
commonly
chosen
for
demarking
the
difference
between
childhood
and
adulthood.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
it
could,
your
honor.
that's
always
a
potential.
the
eighth
amendment
speaks
of
the
evolving
standards,
and
so
if
those
standards
did
in
fact
change
i
guess
a
case
could
come
up
before
the
court
again
in
the
future
where
this
question
would
have
to
be
reexamined.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
yes,
sir,
even
up
to
20
or
25
years
ago.
i
would
say
it's
only
been
within
the
last
few
years
that
18
has
been
more
recognized
as
the
age
that
demarks
children
from
adults.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
yes,
your
honor.
all
of
the
objective
indicators
indicate
that
society
recognizes
and
supports
the
notion
that
16-year-olds
are
children
and
that
by
virtue
of
that
fact
alone
are
entitled
to
differential
treatment
from
the
state.
the
people
of
missouri
have
never
specifically
permitted
the
execution
of
16-year-old
children.
instead,
the
attorney
general
is
asking
this
court
to
presume
that
because
missouri
has
a
transfer
statute
which
permits
children
as
young
as
14
to
be
transferred
into
the
adult
court
system
that
the
missouri
legislature
made
a
considered
judgment
on
the
issue
of
executing
16-year-olds.
a
majority
of
this
court
has
already
rejected
that
reasoning
and
should
do
so
again.
as
justice
o'connor
noted
in
thompson
last
year,
there
may
be
many
reasons
completely
unrelated
to
the
death
penalty
why
a
state
legislature
would
provide
as
a
general
matter
for
the
transfer
of
certain
children
out
of
the
juvenile
and
into
the
adult
court
systems.
one
reason,
which
is
certainly
apparent
in
missouri,
is
that
the
present
juvenile
just
ice
system
lacks
the
resources
and
the
facilities
to
effectively
deal
with
violent
children
or
to
protect
society
against
those
children.
the
juvenile
court
in
this
case
noted
that
when
it
transferred
heath
wilkins
into
the
adult
court
system.
the
juvenile
court
stated,
"the
present
juvenile
system
of
rehabilitation
and
confinement
lacks
sufficient
security
to
deal
with
the
perpetrator
who
constitutes
a
threat
to
society
and
there
are
no
adequate
rehabilitative
facilities
available
to
the
juvenile
court
should
jurisdiction
of
the
above-named
juvenile
be
retained
by
the
court.
"
however,
it
must
always
be
kept
in
mind
that
transferring
a
child,
even
a
violent
16-year-old,
from
the
juvenile
court
system
into
the
adult
court
system
does
not
transform
that
child
into
an
adult.
thus,
the
16-year-old
being
treated
as
if
he
were
an
adult
is
still
denied
most
of
the
rights
enjoyed
by
adults.
he
can
never
be
judged
by
a
jury
of
his
peers
since
his
peers
are
considered
too
young
to
serve
on
juries.
if
he
becomes
sick
while
he
is
in
custody,
the
state
must
seek
permission
from
his
parent
or
his
guardian
before
medical
treatment
can
be
rendered.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
twenty-one,
your
honor.
and
if
he
is
sued
by
his
victim's
family,
he
must
be--
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
--yes,
your
honor.
partly
i
would
think
that
he
would
be
completely
denied
the
right
to
have
anyone
his
own
age
on
a
jury,
even
the
potential
for
that,
since
in
missouri
you
have
to
be
21
to
serve
on
a
jury.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
not
necessarily,
your
honor,
but
it's
at
least
theoretically
possible
that
people
your
age
could
serve
on
the
jury.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
that's
true.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
that's
true,
our
honor.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
i
disagree
on
that,
your
honor.
the
attorney
general
also
asks
this
court
to
presume
that
because
the
missouri
death
penalty
statute
lists
age
as
a
mitigating
factor
that
the
state
has
made
a
considered
judgment
concerning
the
constitutionality
of
executing
children.
again,
such
a
presumption
cannot
be
made.
the
missouri
death
penalty
statute
also
lists
the
extreme
emotional
disturbance
of
the
defendant,
or
whether
or
not
it
asks
the
censor
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
ability
of
the
defendant
to
conform
his
conduct
to
the
requirements
of
law
was
substantially
impaired.
however,
the
fact
that
the
missouri
legislature
recognizes
that
the
mental
state
of
a
defendant
is
important
in
sentencing
can
in
no
way
supplant
the
constitutional
prohibition
against
executing
the
insane.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
he's
20
years
old
now,
your
honor.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
twenty.
the
attorney
general's
argument
concerning
age
as
a
mitigator
must
fail
for
the
same
reason.
it
rests
on
the
presupposition
that
16-year-olds
are
in
fact
death-eligible
and
in
that
way
begs
the
question
before
the
court.
age
as
a
mitigating
factor
is
as
available
to
the
60-year-old
defendant
as
it
is
to
the
16-year-old
defendant,
and
thus
tells
us
nothing
about
how
young
is
too
young
to
be
put
to
death.
finally,
the
attorney
general
blurs
the
very
real
distinction
between
death
and
every
other
punishment
available
to
the
state.
the
fact
that
a
particular
16-year-old
needs
or
deserves
confinement
beyond
his
18th
birthday
in
no
way
provides
a
constitutional
justification
for
executing
that
same
16-year-old.
the
people
of
missouri
have
never
ascribed
to
that
argument.
since
the
death
penalty
was
reinstituted
in
missouri
in
1977,
16
offenders
who
were
16
years
old
or
younger
have
been
transferred
to
adult
courts
and
charged
with
first-degree
murder.
only
one,
heath
wilkins,
was
sentenced
to
death.
no
jury
in
missouri
has
ever
sentenced
a
person
to
death
for
a
crime
committed
at
the
age
of
16,
despite
having
found
transferees
guilty
of
first-degree
murder.
in
addition,
prosecutors
are
much
more
likely
to
waive
the
death
penalty
in
cases
involving
those
who
committed
their
crimes
at
the
age
of
16.
in
eight
of
those
16
cases,
the
defendant
ultimately
stood
trial
for
first-degree
murder.
in
five
of
those
eight
cases
the
prosecutor
waived
the
death
penalty.
thus,
in
64.5
percent
of
the
cases
involving
those
who
committed
their
crimes
at
the
age
of
16
the
death
penalty
was
waived,
and
that
compares
to
approximately
33
percent
of
the
cases
involving
adults
in
which
the
death
penalty
was
waived
by
the
prosecutor.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
your
honor,
heath
wilkins
wasn't
sentenced
by
a
jury.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
of
his
age,
your
honor?
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
yes,
your
honor,
they
knew
his
age.
petitioner
would
argue
and
argues
in
the
brief
that
it
was
never
considered,
never
given
the
sort
of
close
consideration
that
this
court
would
require
before
a
death
sentence
could
be
entered.
thus,
juries
and
prosecutors,
those
in
the
best
position
to
express
the
conscience
of
the
community
on
issues
of
life
and
death,
have
rejected
the
death
penalty
as
a
legitimate
punishment
for
those
who
commit
their
crimes
at
the
age
of
16.
professional
and
religious
leaders
have
also
rejected
the
practice
of
executing
our
young,
as
is
evidenced
by
the
numerous
groups
that
have
filed
amicus
briefs
on
behalf
of
heath
wilkins
and
kevin
stanford.
in
addition,
two
particularly
relevant
events
have
occurred
since
this
court's
decision
in
thompson.
first,
on--
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
since
this
court's
decision
in
thompson
v.
oklahoma,
two
particularly
relevant
events
have
occurred.
the
first
was
on
july
14,
1988,
when
the
national
council
of
juvenile
and
family
court
judges
passed
a
resolution
opposing
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
on
those
who
commit
their
crimes
under
the
age
of
18.
as
the
amicus
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
the
attorneys
general
of
17
states
in
this
case
noted,
juvenile
court
judges
face
the
problem
of
violent
children
on
a
daily
basis
therefore,
that
group's
call
for
an
end
to
the
practice
of
executing
those
who
commit
crimes
under
the
age
of
18
lends
strong
support
to
petitioner's
contention
that
there
is
a
consensus
in
this
country
against
the
practice.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
no,
your
honor.
the
attorneys
general
of
17
states
filed
an
amicus
brief
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
missouri
in
this
case.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
and
in
that
brief
they
note,
they
specifically
discuss
the
national
council
of
juvenile
and
family
court
judges
and
note
that
the
judges
deal
with
this
problem
on
a
daily
basis.
the
second
particularly
relevant
event
occurred
on
october
21,
1988,
when
congress
passed
the
death
penalty
amendment
to
the
federal
drug
bill.
that
amendment
excludes
those
who
commit...
execution
of
those
who
commit
their
crimes
under
the
age
of
18,
and
petitioner
would
argue
again
that
this
lends
strong
support
to
our
contention
that
there
is
a
national
consensus
in
this
country
against
the
practice
of
executing
our
young--
finally,
the
international
community
has
voiced
its
disapproval
of
executing
those
who
commit
their
crimes
while
under
the
age
of
18.
heath
wilkins
stands
alone
on
missouri's
death
row
as
the
only
person
who
committed
his
crime
at
the
age
of
16.
he
is
not
there
because
a
jury
determined
that
he
deserved
the
death
penalty,
nor
is
he
there
because
the
prosecuting
attorney
in
missouri
determined
that
the
death
penalty
should
not
be
waived.
rather,
heath
wilkins,
who
because
of
his
age
could
not
have
represented
himself
in
a
civil
suit,
was
permitted
to
represent
himself.
he
pleaded
guilty
and
then
did
everything
within
his
power
to
ensure
that
he
received
a
death
sentence,
a
sentence
which,
again
based
solely
on
the
date
of
his
birth,
he
would
be
considered
too
young
to
witness.
in
thompson,
justice
o'connor
called
for
strong
counter-evidence
that
the
national
consensus
against
this
practice
does
not
exist.
the
attorney
general
has
been
unable
to
provide
such
evidence
for
the
simple
reason
that
it
doesn't
exist.
all
of
the
objective
indicia
of
our
current
and
evolving
standards
of
decency
indicate
that
society
rejects
capital
punishment
as
a
legitimate
punishment
for
those
who
commit
their
crimes
while
children.
there
is
a
second
related
but
independent
basis
upon
which--
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
--well,
your
honor,
in
missouri
the
state
has
never
specifically
permitted
the
execution
of
16-year-olds.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
yes,
your
honor,
they
did
affirm.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
not
on
this,
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that--
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
--the
state
legislature
would
be
a
more
accurate
gauge
of
public
policy
on
this,
your
honor.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
the
only
statute
which
specifically
deals
with
juveniles
and
the
death
penalty
is
the
one
that
won't
permit
persons
under
the
age
of
18
to
witness
an
execution.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
well,
your
honor,
in
this
case
they
didn't
specifically
address
that
contention.
petitioner
asked
that
that
be
addressed,
but
based
on
the
fact
that
they
did
affirm
heath
wilkins'
sentence,
yes,
your
honor,
that's
probably
true.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
eighteen,
your
honor.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
that's
true,
your
honor.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
age
is
more
than
a
sympathetic
factor
of
the
defendant.
i
think
that
when
you
look
at
this
nation's
attitudes
towards
children,
which
is
defined
by
age,
we
have
carved
out
a
special
place
for
those
children
in
society
as
well
as
under
the
law,
a
place
that
is
not
shared
by
other
what
you
would
call
sympathetic
groups
such
as
blind
people.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
what
would
distinguish
an
elderly
person
from
a
child
is
that
the
society
doesn't
normally
consider
an
elderly
person
to
be
less
competent
than
an
adult,
but
we
do
make
that
assumption
about
children
in
this
country
in
virtually
every
area
of
life.
and
what
petitioner
is
arguing
is
that
assumption
should
be
carried
forward
in
this
particular
context.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
yes,
your
honor,
that's
true.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
but
we
have
also
an
entirely
separate
juvenile
justice
system
which
recognizes
the
differences
between
children
and
adults.
and
when
you
begin
to
talk
about
the
transfer
statutes
you
have
to
take
into
consideration
the
facilities
and
the
resources
available
to
the
states,
and
petitioner's
contention
is
the
transfer
statute
more
properly
indicates
a
lack
of
resources
and
facilities
than
it
does
any
sort
of
a
judgment
that
children
are
in
fact,
when
they
commit
criminal
acts,
adults,
which
i
think
has
been
not
the
case
of
how
we
deal
with
children.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
no,
your
honor.
it's
a
judicial
determination
made
by
the
juvenile
court
judge
and
the
age
if
14.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
an
examination
of
missouri
case
law
on
this
would
indicate
that
what
the
courts
primarily
look
at
in
missouri
is
the
age
of
the
child
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
offense,
the
seriousness
of
the
offense,
and
the
availability
of
resources
and
facilities
within
the
state
to
deal
with
that
child.
so
that
a
child
who
is
nearing
the
age
of
the
end
of
juvenile
court
jurisdiction
who
commits
a
very
serious
offense
and
is
deemed
to
need
incarceration
or
deserve
incarceration
beyond,
let's
say,
the
18th
birthday
then
is
transferred
into
adult
courts
because
the
juvenile
courts
simply
don't
have
the
facilities
to
deal
with
them.
your
honor,
at
this
point
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
thank
you,
your
honor.
first
i
would
like
to
discuss
something
that
mr.
morris
talked
about,
the
lack
of
an
objective
basis
for
choosing
an
age,
and
then
later
on
in
his
argument
he
spoke
about
and
everyone
on
the
court
seems
to
agree
that
there
an
age
below
which
the
states
could
not
constitutionally
execute
a...
someone
for
a
crime.
petitioner
would
argue
that
all
the
objective
indicators
in
the
society
point
to
that
age
as
being
18.
when
you
look
at
the
vast
majority
of
states
set
18
as
the
age
of
emancipation,
the
international
standard
is
clearly
at
18,
the
american
bar
association
has
chosen
18,
the
american
law
institute
has
chosen
18,
the
national
council
of
juvenile
and
court
judges
has
chosen
18,
the
majority
of
courts
which
have
specifically
set
an
age
set
it
at
18...
that
is
12
states
have
chosen
that
age.
and
when
you
just
intuitively
think
about
where
it
is
that
we
draw
the
line
between
childhood
and
adulthood,
the
most
common
figure
is
in
fact
18.
as
to
the
states
which
don't
specifically
set
an
age
limit
and
what
he
can
presume
and
not
presume
from
those
statutes,
i
would
point
to
the
same
statute
that
the
attorney
general
has
pointed
to,
which
is
the
florida
statute,
and
that
statute
states
that
a
person,
a
child
of
any
age
shall
be
transferred
up
if
charged
with
a
capital
crime
and
a
person
of
any
age,
if
found
guilty
of
that
crime,
shall
be
sentenced
as
if
that
person
were
an
adult.
so
that
statute
doesn't
tell
us
anything
about
how
young
is
too
young
to
be
executed.
concerning
the
missouri
legislation
that
has
taken
place
since
thompson
there
was
in
the
juvenile
omnibus
act
an
insertion
to
set
the
minimum
age
at
18.
the
legislature
voted
to
remove
that
without
consideration.
they
have
simply
not
considered
the
question
this
term,
and
there
is
a
house
bill
currently
pending
in
the
missouri
legislature
but
no
action
has
been
taken
on
that
bill.
as
far
as
the
relevance
of
the
other
sorts--
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
--when
they
were
about
to
debate
the
omnibus
juvenile
bill
there
was
a
motion
made
to
just
simply
remove
the
part
of
that
bill
that
would
have
set
the
minimum
age
at
18.
that
was
voted
on.
that
part,
section
of
the
bill
was
removed
and
it
wasn't
debated
or
considered.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
yes,
your
honor.
they
voted
to
remove
that
section
from
the
bill
without
considering
it
or
voting
specifically
on
it,
but
only
to
vote
yes
or
no
to
remove
it.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
well,
your
honor,
i'm
just
pointing
that
out
to
show
that
the
attorney
general
has
argued
that
the
legislatures,
that
it
they
had,
if
there
was
some
strong
feeling
on
this
issue
that
the
legislatures
would
in
fact
deal
with
the
issue.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
no,
i
don't,
your
honor.
i
think
that
they
are
waiting
for
some
guidance
from
this
court.
as
far
as
the
other
sorts
of
class-based
statutes
such
as
voting
age
and
setting
juries,
the
relevance
of
those
statutes
indicates
our,
as
a
society's,
attitude
towards
children
and
our
belief
that
children
are,
as
a
class,
less
capable
of
making
the
sorts
of
mature
determinations
that
are
necessary
to
allow
them
to
have
the
kinds
of
rights
and
responsibilities
which
we
permit
adults
in
the
society.
and
i
think
the
court
should
consider
those
statutes
for
that
purpose
as
how
they
indicate
society's
attitudes
towards
children.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
no,
your
honor,
i'm
not.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
no,
your
honor,
we're
not
talking
about
the
fact
that
a
16-year-old
child
cannot
act
with
criminal
responsibility.
petitioner's
argument
is
that
no
16-year-old
can
act
with
the
level
of
moral
culpability
which
should
be
required
by
a
society
before
that
person
is
executed,
and
that
we
require
the
highest
level
of
moral
culpability
and
responsibility
before
we
would
execute
a
person
for
a
crime
committed.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
nancy
a
mckerrow
yes,
your
honor.
it
goes
to
the
ability
to
use
the
legislature
as
some
sort
of
a
factor.
it
goes
back
to
justice
o'connor's
concurring
opinion
in
thompson
that
we
can
wait
for
the
legislature
to
act
on
this,
but
it's
petitioner's
contention
that
what
occurred
in
missouri
this
year
is
that
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
legislators
are
waiting
to
see
whether
they
can
operate
within.
they
know
that
they
are
constrained
by
the
constitution
and
that
it's
this
court's
responsibility
to
inform
them
of
what
the
constitution
requires,
and
they
are
waiting
for
that.
