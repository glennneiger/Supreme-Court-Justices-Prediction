mr.
heft,
the
difference
in
the...
in
the
examples
that
you
give
is
this.
we...
we
don't
have
a
mechanism
where...
whereby
the
individual
cases
can
be...
can
be
individuated.
in...
with...
with
respect
to
voting,
for
example,
you
don't...
there's
no
registrar
you
can
go
before
to
say,
well,
even
though
you're
not
quite
18,
are
you
nevertheless
mature
enough.
whereas,
here
you're
talking
about
the
situation
where
a
jury
in
every
case,
in
fact,
even
before
the
jury,
you...
you
have
to
have
a
judge
say
that
this
juvenile
can
be
tried
as
an
adult.
that
determination
is
first
made.
then
afterwards,
a
jury
can
consider
the
individual
characteristics
of
this
person
and
can
say,
even
though
this
person
is
only
17
years
and
nine
months,
we
think
this
person
is
mature
enough
to
be
held
liable.
that's
totally
different
from
voting
or
any
other
area
i
can
think
of.
we
have
an
individuating
procedure
in
place
at
two
stages.
justice
antonin
scalia
xxx
perfect
example.
for
all
i
know,
the
jury
considered
this
very
thoroughly
and
thought
this
individual...
although
normally
i
personally...
and
i
suppose
most
jurors...
would...
would
not
vote
for...
for
that
in...
in
the
case
of
a
youthful
offender.
the
jury,
for
all
we
know,
considered
this
and
said
we
think
this
person
was
mature
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
have
to
be
bound
by
your
18
year
old
rule
even
if
the
jury,
for
example,
were
shown
evidence
that
this
individual
went
around
bragging
i
don't
have
to
worry
about
the
death
penalty
because
i'm
only
17
years
old,
17
and
11
months,
and
they
can't
get
me
for
another
month.
even
though
the
jury
had
that
evidence
in
front
of
it,
or...
or
the
jury
had
the
evidence
that
this
individual
was
selected
to
do
the
killing
because
this
individual
could
not
get
it
being
one
month
short
of
18.
this
seems
to
me
a
much
more
arbitrary
system
of
justice
than...
than
the
one
we
have
now.
and
you're
putting
this
forward
in
the...
in
the
interest
of
being
more
equitable?
it
doesn't
seem
equitable
to
me
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia

a
decision
that
where
we
have
no
individuating
mechanism,
that's
the
line
we'll
use.
but
here
we
have
an
individuating
mechanism,
a
jury
that
consider...
can
consider
in
each
case
the
particular
individual.
if
we
could
do
that
in
voting,
i'm
be
willing
to
have
a
voting
age
of
13
if
you
had
somebody
that
would
consider
each
individual
voter.
i
can...
you
know,
i
can
think
of
some
15
year
olds
i'd
like
to
have
vote
and
maybe
some
30
year
olds
i
wouldn't.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
again
why
we
have
juries.
and
juries
sometimes
won't
execute
a
25
year
old
who
they
think
is...
is...
is
too
childlike.
that's
why
we
have
juries.
justice
antonin
scalia
once
again,
it
has
created
that
presumption
in
areas
where
it
has
no
individuating
procedure.
but
here
we
have
an
individuating
procedure.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
any
risk
of
error
is
too
much,
we
just
better
abandon
the
criminal
law.
nobody
can
guarantee
perfection
in
any
human
endeavor.
you
can't
really
mean
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i...
i
think...
i
think
you
do
mean
your
statement
that
any
risk
of
error
is
too
much,
and...
and
the
conclusion
that
leads
to
is
that
capital
punishment
is
impermissible,
which
is
not
a
conclusion
we've
accepted.
incidentally,
as
far
as
those
nations
that...
if
we
were
governed
by
the
other
nations
of
the
world,
how
many
of
those...
that
is
the
lineup
with
respect
to
the
permissibility
of
capital
punishment
at
all
for
juveniles
or
anybody
else?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
many...
how
many
other
besides
the
united
states
currently
allow
it?
do
you
have
any
idea?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
my
impression
is
it's
not
very
many.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
think
that's
really
true.
you're
saying
that
the
death
penalty
is
never
imposed
by
our
society
except
upon
people
who...
who
cannot
be
corrected
so
that
they
won't
do
it
again.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that's
just
not
true.
i
think
sometimes
we
execute
people
that
you
know
won't
commit
the
crime
of
murder
again,
but
the
crime
they've
committed
is
so
heinous
that
society
decides
to
impose
capital
punishment.
i
mean,
it
may
be
the
killing
of
a
wife
or
some
person.
you
know
it
will
never
happen
again,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i
understand.
i'm
just...
i'm
just
questioning
your...
your
general
proposition
that...
that
a
touchstone
of
whether
we...
our
society
as
a
whole
imposes
capital
punishment...
we
only
do
so
when
the
person
cannot
be
induced
never
to
commit
that
kind
of
murder
again.
i...
i
just
don't
think
so,
i
think,
you
know,
if
adolf
hitler
had
come
in
and
said
i
promise
i'll
never
do
it
again,
and
we
believed
him,
i
think
we
would
still
impose
capital
punishment.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
you
could
say
the
same
thing
about
life
in
prison
i
mean,
i
don't
see
how
logic
imposes
this
upon
us
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand.
age
has
to
do
with
whether
you
have
a
jury
of
your
peers
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
i
have
a
jury
composed
entirely
of
21-year-olds,
i
have
not
gotten
a
jury
of
my
peers?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
the
constitution
doesn't
require
just
the
possibility
of
a
jury
of
your
peers,
but
the
reality
of
a
jury
of
your
peers.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
all
the
constitution
requires,
that
you
have
a
good
shot
at
getting
a
jury
of
your
peers?
i
thought
you
had
to
have
a
jury
of
your
peers.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
age
has
anything
to
go
with
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
if
it
is
that
uniform
a
social
feeling,
presumably...
i
mean,
the
state
does
have
a
legislature,
i
assume,
which
is
popularly
elected
which
could
eliminate
this
death
penalty
for
16-year-olds
with
a
stroke
of
the
pen.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
mckerrow,
you
do
not
acknowledge...
how
many
states
have
a
statutory
structure
would
apparently
allow
a
16-year-old
to
be
executed,
although
they
don't
say
specifically
a
16-year-old
may
be
executed?
justice
antonin
scalia
eighteen
states.
and
if
you
walk
through
their
statutes
there's
nothing
in
it
that
would
prevent
a
16-year-old
from
being
executed?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
what
you
insist
upon
is
that
the
state
adopt
a
statute
that
specifically
says
16-year-olds
may
be
executed,
right?
that's
all
you
will
accept?
that's
a
pretty
hard
thing
to
expect
a
state
to
adopt.
i'm
not
sure
i
could
get
a
state
to
adopt
a
statute
that
says,
you
know,
blind
people
can
be
executed,
although
i
can
fully
see
how
in
a
particular
circumstance
a
jury
might
impose
a
sentence
of
death
upon
a
blind
person.
why
do
you
pick
out
the
particular
sympathetic
factor
of
youth
as
the
one
that
the
state
must
set
forth
in
les
statute?
you
wouldn't
say
that
if
it
were
a
blind
person
convicted
to
death.
you
wouldn't
say
well,
you
can't
do
it
unless
the
state
says
in
so
many
words.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
elderly
people?
when...
i
don't
recall
seeing
many
states
that
have
recently
executed
someone
over
70,
let's
say.
is
there
a
national
consensus
that
the
elderly
should
not
be
executed,
too,
and
are
the
laws
that
would
permit
the
elderly
to
be
executed
invalid
unless
the
state
expressly
says
we
are
willing
to
execute
people
over
70?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
we
don't
generally
make
it
in
the
criminal
area.
we
don't.
i
mean,
the
fact
is,
we
don't.
we're
willing
to
send
children
to
prison
for
life
even
though
they
are
16,
aren't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
once
again,
as
far
as
rights
or
responsibilities
are
concerned,
you
are
not
arguing
that
society
wouldn't
or
that
a
state
here
could
not
send
a
child
to
jail
for
life,
a
16-year-old
to
jail
for
life?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
child
is
responsible
for
the
criminal
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
all
you
are
arguing
here
is
you
can
do
it
for
life
but
you
can't
execute,
and
that's
seems
to
me
to
be,
although
you
disclaim
the
argument
that
this
is
just
a
sympathy
factor,
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
exactly
what
the
case
is,
because
you
hold
the
child
responsible.
you
are
willing
to
send
the
child
to
jail
for
life,
which
you
would
not
do
an
insane
person.
for
insane
people
we
don't
say...
you
just
can't
execute
them
if
the
person
is
insane
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
it's
a
defense
in
virtually
every
state,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
responsibility.
but
you're
not
talking
here
about
responsibility,
it
seems
to
me.
