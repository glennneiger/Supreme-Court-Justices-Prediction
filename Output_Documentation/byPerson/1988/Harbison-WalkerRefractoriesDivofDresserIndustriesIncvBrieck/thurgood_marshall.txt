justice
thurgood
marshall
but
burdine
does
insist
on
worthiness
of
the
testimony.
they
used
the
word
"credence",
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
it
reads
something
like
that.
may
i
ask
one
other
question.
in
your
view
is
the
summary
judgment
stage,
is
the
defendant
better
off
if
he
puts
in
no
evidence
at
all
or
if
he
puts
in
a
false
defense
and
it's
proven
to
be
false?
would
be
in
the
same
position
in
both
or
would
be
better
off
under
one
rather
than
the
other?
better
than
lying.
