justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
kramer,
aren't
you
leaving
out
one
thing.
is
it
not
permissible
for
the
plaintiff
in
a
situation
like
this
to
argue
that
the
evidence
of
a
neutral
motive
that
you
put
forward
is
conflicting
and
is
subject
to
the
interpretation
that
was
actually
pretextual,
and
the
pretext
itself
tends
to
provide
discrimination.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
agree...
just
so
i
understand...
you
look
at
the
whole
record,
but
if
on
the
basis
of
the
entire
record
what
they
put
in
initially
and
your
defensive
evidence,
if
the
trier
of
fact
could
find
that
an
inference
of
pretext
could
be
drawn,
would
that
not
be
enough
to
defeat
summary
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
fact,
there's
an
inference
of
pretext?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
you're
saying
here
the
record
here
is
so
clear
it
isn't
even
arguable
that
what
you
put
forward
was
contradicted
initially.
justice
john
paul
stevens
say
that
again
for
me.
you
say
that
they
cannot
establish
pretext
based
on
the
fact
that
your
testimony
is
apparently
unbelievable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
is
your
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
can
you
not
infer
a
discriminatory
motive
from
the
mere
fact
that
you
advanced
a
pretextual
reason
for
the
discharge
decision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
that?
see,
i
don't
really...
maybe
we
should
be
clear
what
we
mean
when
we
talk
about
pretext.
some
of
our
cases
say
if
the
plaintiff
can
show
that
it
is
a
pretext
for
discrimination.
well,
to
provide
that
it
is
a
pretext
for
discrimination
is
one
thing.
to
prove
merely
that
it
is
a
pretext
is
something
quite
different.
you
can
prove
that
the
excuse
i
give
is
a
pretext
without
proving
that
it's
a
pretext
for
discrimination.
why
must
one
conclude
that
the
real
reason
is
discrimination
simply
because
i
come
up
with
a
phony
reason
that
you
don't
believe.
maybe
i
didn't
have
any
reason
to
fire
the
guy.
i
don't
know.
it
was
an
irrational
thing.
i
run
a
lousy
business,
and
i
fired
this
fellow.
i'm
sued.
i
come
up
with
a
reason
that
is
implausible.
it's
a
pretext.
but
is
it
necessarily
a
pretext
for
discrimination?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
what
must
be
proved
is
not
mere
that
it's
false,
but
that
it
is
false
and
the
real
reason
is
discrimination.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
you're
taking
a
different
position
than
you
did
a
minute
ago.
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
you
merely
prove...
you
don't
know
why,
but
you
merely
prove
that
the
reason
given
is
totally
false.
then
i
ask
you...
you
say,
well,
why
did
he
give
a
false
reason?
could
the
trier
of
fact
say
well,
perhaps
he
did
it
because
he
wanted
to
conceal
his
true
motive?
you
can
prove
it,
but
you
just
know
he
came
up
with
a
reason
that's
demonstrably
false.
can
you
infer
discrimination
from
that
mere
fact?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
on
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
that's
a
different
answer
than
i
thought
you
gave
justice--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
think
it
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
do
you
have
to
do
that
if
you
agree
that
all
you
have
to
do
is
prove
the
only
reason
advanced
was
a
false
reason,
and
falsity
itself
gives
rise
to
an
inference
that
the
true
reason
was
discriminatory.
why
do
you
have
to
look
at
anything
more
than
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
yes,
it
does.
your
opponent
takes
the
position
that
the
reason
you
gave
is
not
the
true
reason.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
whole
heart
of
the
lawsuit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
you've
limited
your
response
to
that
affirmative
evidence.
do
you
also
argue
that
the
fact,
as
you
contend...
your
opponent
disagrees...
that
an
incorrect
explanation
purported
to
be
neutral
explanation
was
given
and
that
the
inference
of
discrimination
can
be
drawn
from
the
fact
of
giving
an
incorrect
explanation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
part
of
your
affirmative
proof
of
discrimination
is
what
you
just
recited
to
justice
scalia,
plus
your
contention
which
may
or
may
not
be
supported
by
the
record,
that
the
evidence...
that
the
so-called
neutral
reason
was
pretextual?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
that
gives
rise
to...
itself
to
a
inference
of
discrimination?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
give
up.
mr.
logan,
isn't
the
answer
to
that
easy?
i
mean,
if...
supposing
the
employer's
explanation
is
we
have
a
policy
of
firing
armed
robbers,
and
this
man
has
been
convicted
of
armed
robbery.
we
fired
15
people
just
like
him.
there's
no
dispute
about
those
facts,
and
there's
no
evidence
of
discrimination
other
than
the
prima
facie,
you
can
enter
summary
judgment
for
the
defendant
in
that
case,
can't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
certified
copy
of
the
conviction
and--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--bylaws
of
the
company
and
all
that
stuff
and
35
other
people
fired
for
the
same
reason.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
it's
possible?
no
chance
in
the
world
you'd
survive
summary
judgment
on
a
record
like
that.
[laughter]
