mr.
james
h
logan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
if
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
there
are,
whether
there
exist
genuine
issues
as
to
any
material
facts
so
as
to
preclude
the
entry
of
the
summary
judgment.
on
the
record
in
this
case
there
are
implausibilities
and
inconsistencies
in
the
employer's
stated
reasons
as
to
four
different
factors,
and
also
evidence
that
has
been
proffered
by
the
respondent
that
would
directly
contradict
the
reasons
put
forth
by
the
employer.
mr.
james
h
logan
there's
the
evidence
that
there
were
three
of
four
individuals
who
were
installation
specialists
who
were
in
the
protected
age
group,
age
55,
59,
and
59.
mr.
james
h
logan
all
three
of
those
people
were
laid
off
in
the
initial
layoffs
in
july
1982.
the
younger
man
with
less
seniority
than
the
two...
two
of
the
older
people
laid
off
was
retained
and
not
laid
off
until
november
18,
1982,
and
he
was
the
only
one
who
was
permanently
recalled.
mr.
james
h
logan
that's
according
to
only
one
individual,
and
that
is
mr.
faust
himself.
he's
the
only
one
that
came
forth
with
any
evidence
as
to
what,
in
fact,
he
did
after
the
recall
and
after
he
was
initially
retained.
100
percent
of
the
people
in
the
protected
age
group
were
adversely
affected
by
this
decision.
mr.
james
h
logan
that's
what
burdine
says.
mr.
james
h
logan
we're
arguing
that
a
jury
could
reasonably
conclude
that
the
proffered
reason
is
not
worthy
of
credence
and
that
they
could
also--
mr.
james
h
logan
--that's
correct.
mr.
james
h
logan
yes,
i'm
quite
comfortable
with
the
third
circuit
decision,
but
there's
much
more
than
that.
mr.
james
h
logan
when
it
talked
about
the...
what...
the
duties
that
mr.
faust
actually
performed
after
his
initial
retention
and
after
his
layoffs.
they
cited
to
the
record
where
faust
himself
admitted
that
he
spent
a
small
portion
of
his
time,
a
very
small
percentage
is
what
he
said,
doing
these
allegedly
non...
these
allegedly...
utilizing
these
allegedly
versatile
skills.
mr.
james
h
logan
that's
correct.
mr.
james
h
logan
not
under
the
records...
not
under
the
record
of
this
case.
mr.
james
h
logan
i
think...
i
can't
really
think
of
a
case
where
an
employer
who's
an
interested
witness
could
properly
get
summary
judgment.
mr.
james
h
logan
that
isn't
this
case.
mr.
james
h
logan
we
have
plenty
of
disputes
in
this
case.
mr.
james
h
logan
unless
the--
mr.
james
h
logan
--if
it
were,
if
it
were
a
bare
bones
prima
facie
case,
which
this
one
isn't--
mr.
james
h
logan
--he
could
cross-examine
that
interested
witness.
mr.
james
h
logan
he
has
to
do
something.
mr.
james
h
logan
and
we
also
have--
mr.
james
h
logan
--well,
in
this--
mr.
james
h
logan
--if
it
were
bare
bones--
mr.
james
h
logan
--you
may
have
a
point.
but
this
is
not
bare
bones,
this
prima
facie
case.
mr.
james
h
logan
if
it
were
much
skinnier
than
in
this
case,
sir.
mr.
james
h
logan
if
there
was
objective...
if
there
was
objective
information
to
rely
on--
mr.
james
h
logan
--other...
other
than
just
the--
mr.
james
h
logan
--it's
possible
in
a
case--
mr.
james
h
logan
--in
this
case
the
petitioner...
we
have
much
more
than
a
bare
bones
prima
facie
case
in
this
case.
mr.
james
h
logan
if
there
was
a
consistently
followed--
mr.
james
h
logan
--policy
of
the
employer--
mr.
james
h
logan
--i
don't
want
to
say
that
there's
never
a
chance--
mr.
james
h
logan
--for
an
employer
to
get
summary
judgment.
mr.
james
h
logan
it
is
the
employee's
burden
to
do
something
with
that.
they
can
cross-examine
the
witness,
have
the
witness--
mr.
james
h
logan
--the
employer's
supposed
to
be
on
the
witness
stand.
mr.
james
h
logan
it
would
be
something
for
the
jury
to
consider,
depending
on
how
bare
bones
it
is.
mr.
james
h
logan
i'd
be
willing
to
concede
the
point
under
the
hypothetical
you
posed.
mr.
james
h
logan
under
that...
narrow
hypothetical,
yes.
in
this
case
the
petitioner
has
asserted
as
to
the
ratings
that
they've
asserted
as
undisputed
that
the
younger
man
had
higher
ratings
in
the
years
in
question
than
the
respondent
in
this
case.
that
is
not
what
the
record
reflects.
the
record
reflects
that
the...
according
to
the
testimony
of
an
employer
witness,
the
immediate
supervisor
of
the
respondent
in
this
case
that
for
a
period
of
seven
years
from
1975
to
1982,
he
had
always...
that
is
always
rated
him
a
3.
if
you
look
at
mr.
sekeras'
affidavit,
he
indicated
that
for
several
years
respondent
had
been
rated
a
2.
this
is
a
direct
conflict
between
the
employer's
own
witness
as
to
a
very
important...
one
of
the
proffered
reasons.
in
addition,
you
have
a
june
17,
1982
memo
that
antedated
the
implementation
of
the
decision
to
make
the
july
layoffs.
it
was
from
a
mr.
shonkwiler,
a
vice
president
of
marketing,
to
the
personnel
manager.
this
is
at
the
joint
appendix,
page
146,
where
he
indicates
that
for
1981
and
'82,
the
respondent
and
the
younger
man
were
rated
exactly...
exactly
the
same,
fully
satisfactory.
in
that
same
document
it
indicates
that
the
respondent
had
more
seniority
than
the
younger
man,
15
months
more
seniority.
there's
a
direct
conflict
in
the
testimony
of
the
employer's
own
witnesses
in
that
regard.
the
company
also
indicated
that
seniority
was
one
of
the
major
reasons
it
relied
upon
in
deciding
which
employees
to
lay
off.
this
is
according
to
a
senior
vice
president,
ytterberg.
according
to
the
testimony
of
three
of
the
employer
witnesses,
mr.
sekeras,
mr.
sheatsley,
and
mr.
nicolella...
and
this
is
all
set
forth
in
our
brief...
they
either
ignored
or
gave
no
weight
whatsoever
to
the
employers
having
more
seniority
in
the
company
and
14
more
years
in
this
particular
job
of
installation
specialist.
and
in
the
briefs
the
petitioner
said
well,
that's
about
the
same.
well,
seniority,
a
jury
could
reasonably
conclude
that
an
employer
meant
what
it
said
and
its
seniority
meant
seniority.
it's
plausible,
it's
reasonable
for
a
jury
to
draw
that
inference.
the
petitioner
itself...
and
mr.
nicolella,
i
might
add,
the
personnel
manager
who
reviewed
the
decision
before
it
was
made
final...
the
recommendation
before
it
was
made
final...
was
just
plain
out
wrong
when
he
said
that
faust
had
more
seniority
than
did
the
respondent.
as
petitioner
indicates
in
its
reply
brief
at
page
10,
and
its
original
brief
at
page
15,
a
jury
could
infer
from
the
employer's
failure
to
follow
its
own
established
company
policy
and
procedure,
they
could
infer
discrimination
from
that
and
that's
what
the
petitioner
concedes.
in
addition,
in
the
june
17,
1982
memo
that
was
entitled
145...
they
said
that
mr.
brieck,
the
respondent,
had
limited
expertise.
well,
this
is
directly
contradicted
by
the
march
24,
1982
memorandum
that
appears
at
the
very
last
page
of
the
joint
appendix
from
mr.
jamison,
respondent's
own
immediate
supervisor,
where
he
commended
him
for
his
fine
work,
gave
him
a
merit
raise,
said
you're
doing...
he
commended
him
for
his
good
work,
thanked
him
for
his
fine
efforts,
and
sent
him
out
on
another
international
assignment.
respondent
has
come
forth
with
evidence
that
he
was
the
only
one
of
all
these
installation
specialists
who
had
ever
been
sent
out
on
international
assignments.
chile,
mexico,
brazil,
argentina,
canada,
and
he
said
dozens
of
times.
a
jury
could
reasonably
infer
that
they
wouldn't
send
out
the
least
qualified
installation
specialist
to
go
out
and
do
international
assignments.
you
wouldn't
send
out
somebody
with
limited
expertise.
the
record
is
also
full
of
evidence,
even
in
mr.
faust's
own
words,
that
he
was
the
office
gofer.
a
jury
could
conclude
that
these
allegedly
versatile
skills
were
hardly
more
than
clerical
in
nature.
a
jury
could
infer
that.
we're
not
saying
it
necessarily
leads
to
that
conclusions.
all
we
want
is
the
chance
to
get
this
case
to
a
jury.
we
think
that
there
are
genuine
issues
as
to
material
facts.
rule
56(c)
does
not
require
the
employee
in
order
to
survive
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
to
effectively
raise
a
doubt
as
to
all
issues
of
material
fact,
but
as
to
any
issue
of
material
fact
which
are
in
this
case
the
employer's
proffered
reasons.
they
attempted
to
introduce
statistics.
well,
the
statistics
will
show
that
three
out
of
five
people
aged
55
or
over,
that
is,
60
percent,
were
laid
off
in
july
1982.
and
if
you
look
at
four
of
these
people,
100
percent
of
them
were
laid
off.
a
hundred
percent
of
them
were
not
permanently
recalled.
so,
i
think
there
are
plenty
of
issues
of
fact
in
this
particular
case
under
this
record.
we
request
that
the
court
affirm
the
decision
of
the
third
circuit
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
