mr.
martin,
what
is
enough
to
get
to
the
jury
from
the
plaintiff's
evidence
in
a
case
like
this?
i'm
not
clear
on
your
answer.
i
think
you've
been
asked
before.
is
it
enough
that
the
plaintiff
is
in
a
protected
group
and
was
discharged
without
more?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
else
is
required?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
proof
that
the
person
is
in
a
protected
class
and
was
discharged
enough
to
require
the
employer
to
come
forward
with
a
reason?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
a
prima
facie
case
for
that
purpose
is
different
from
a
prima
facie
case
in
your
view
to
get
to
the
jury?
