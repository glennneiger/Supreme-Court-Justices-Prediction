justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
challenge
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
prima
facie
case
was
made
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
hadn't
said
anything
in
response,
judgment
could
have
been
entered
against
your
client.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
your
position
that
when
you...
when
you
came
forward
with
what
you
said
was
a
neutral
explanation,
was
it
your
position
that
if
they...
i
guess
it
must
be...
that
if
the
plaintiff
hadn't
done
anything,
then,
said
anything
or
offered
anything,
that
judgment
should
have
been
entered
for
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
one
by
one,
and
that's
the
question
in
any
of
these
stages.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
would
suppose
you
would
say
that
after
you
present
this
neutral
reason
that
if
the
plaintiff
doesn't
do
anything
else
that
judgment
should
go
for
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
does
it
have
to
go
to
the
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
nevertheless
was
nonexistent?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
this
excuse
that
the
employer
gives
is
false,
it
is
a
nonexistent...
it's
just
nonexistent.
why
aren't
you
back
in
the
same
position
as
you
would
have
been
had
you
said
nothing
at
all?
the
prima
facie
case
is
made
out.
you
come
out
with
a
trumped
up
charge...
trumped
up
excuse
which
is
really
a
nullity.
why
aren't
you
back
in
the
same
position
as
you
were?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
just
enough
for
a
judgment
against
you
if
you
don't
come
up
with
an
excuse.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
presumption
that...
the
presumption
is
there's
a
prima
facie
case,
and
the
presumption
means
you
get
judgment
entered
against
you.
the
fact
that
the
presumption
disappears
doesn't
destroy
the
prima
facie
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
wouldn't
necessarily
mean
that
the
prima
facie
case
wouldn't
be
enough
to
get
to
a
jury.
it
would
just
be...
just
that
it
wouldn't
be
enough
to
require
a
judgment
against
the
employer.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
come
up
with
a
facially
neutral
reason
for
taking
the
act,
the
presumption
disappears.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
see
why
the
prima
facie
case,
the
facts
that
made
up
the
prima
facie
case
are
to
be
disregarded
or
that
the...
or
that
they
aren't
enough
for
a
jury
determination.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
to
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
agree
that
if
the
prima
facie
case
is
made
out,
the
bare
bones,
and
then
the
employer
comes
forward
with
this
reason,
this
neutral
reason,
then
does
the
employer
win
if
the
plaintiff
then
remains
silent
and
doesn't
attack
that
excuse
at
all
and
doesn't
give
any...
offer
any
further
evidence?
has
the
employer
then
won
or
must
the
case
go
to
the
jury?
i
take
it
on
what
you
say
the
bare
bones
case
that
wouldn't
itself
get
to
the
jury,
i
don't
know
why
it
would...
i
would
think
the
plaintiff
would
have
to
do
something
more
when
the
employer
comes
up
with
this
excuse.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes?
justice
byron
r.
white
and...
so,
there
might
be
a
lot
of
other
prima
facie
cases
that
would
have
to
go
to
the
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
well--
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
can
get
summary
judgment--
justice
byron
r.
white
--if
the
employee
didn't
respond
to
the
neutral
explanation.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
prima
facie
case
was
just
a
bare
bones
prima
facie
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
bare
bones
prima
facie
case
as
the
chief
justice
posed,
a
neutral
explanation,
and
the
employee
remains
absolutely
silent,
doesn't
say
a
thing,
doesn't
attack
it
as
pretextual
or
anything
else.
he
has
to
do
something,
doesn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
he
has
to
do
something.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
has
to
either
call
into
question
that
excuse
or
offer
some
other
evidence
of
direct
discrimination.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it?
how
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'm
not
asking...
whether
i
may
have
or
not.
[laughter]
i
just
want
to
know
if
the
employee
stays
silent
when
the...
after
the
employer
offers
his
explanation
doesn't
do
a
thing
and
he
concedes
that
his...
his
prima
facie
case
was
bare
bones.
can
he
get
to
the
jury
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
this
is
just
a
fact-bound
case
involving
no
principle
of
law?
