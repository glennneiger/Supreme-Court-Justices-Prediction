justice
antonin
scalia
--i
wish
you
wouldn't
use
the
word
pretextual.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying,
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
and
i
share
justice
stevens'
perplexity
as
to
what
you're
saying,
but
it
seems
to
me
you're
saying
you
don't
have
to
show
discriminatory
motive.
as
i
understand
your
description
of
our
cases,
we
have
held
that
there
is
a
burden
on
the
employer
to
produce
a
reason
for
firing
someone,
and
if
he
does
not
produce
a
reason,
the
mere
fact
that
you
did
not
keep
on
someone
who
was
within
the
protected
class
is
enough
for
liability.
is
that
what
you're
asserting?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
burden's
on
the
employer
to
come
up
with
a
reason.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
he
had
no
reason,
that's
his
tough
luck.
he
is
guilty
of
discrimination.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
he
must
have
had
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
a
logical
premise
of
your
case,
is
it
not,
that
what
suffices
for
the
prima
facie
case
does
not
suffice
to
the
get
to
the
jury?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
rather
strange
use
of
the
term
prima
facie
case,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
why
act?
you
just
told
us
a
prima
facie
case
isn't
enough
to
get
to
the
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
just
told
us
that
a
prima
facie
case
isn't
enough
to
get
to
a
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
did
this
third
circuit
find
that
way
in
so
many
words?
it
seemed
to
me
they
concentrate
almost
entirely
on
possible
disbelief
of
the
employer's
second
stage
proof
and
very
little
on
what
the
plaintiff
had
shown.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
it
mean
if
it
is
does
not
mean
it's
enough
to
get
to
the
jury?
that's
what
i
don't
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
the
moment
of
truth
with
the
burden
of
production
is
if
you
don't
produce,
you
lose.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
means
it's
enough
to
get
to
the
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
the
question?
i
thought
the
question
was
whether
harbison-walker
discharged
on
the
basis
of
age?
not
whether
it
had--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh,
but
that's
quite
different.
that's
quite
different.
justice
antonin
scalia
by
putting
it
that
way,
you
confuse
me
in
the
answer
you
gave
to
justice
o'connor.
let
me
ask
this:
suppose
the
employee
comes
in
with
nothing,
nothing
whatever
except
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
protected
class,
someone
who
was
not
a
member
of
the
protected
class
who
was
kept
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
nothing
else
to
show
any
age
discrimination,
just
that
statistical...
what
could
be
an
accident.
the
employer
comes
in
with
a
justification.
the
justification
is
refuted.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
happens?
this
is
the
only
evidence
of
discrimination
you
have.
i
was,
you
know,
over
a
certain
age.
someone
who
was
under
that
age
was
kept
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
that
was
not
the
basis.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
why
would
it
lead
to
that
conclusion?
i
can't
imagine.
there's
still
no
evidence
of
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
age
except
the
statistic.
that's
the
only
thing
you
have.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
and?
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
covering
up
something
or
trying
not
to
be
held
liable?
i
mean,
we
have
imposed
on
the
employer
the
burden
to
come
up
with
the
reason.
we're
saying
to
the
employer
even
though
there's
no
evidence
here
of
discrimination,
you
have
to
come
up
with
a
reason.
so
he
says
okay,
here's
a
reason,
and
we
don't
believe
the
reason.
and
then
you
say
that
is
proof
of
discrimination?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
say
it,
but
i
don't
see
that
it's
true.
justice
antonin
scalia
never
mind
the
refutation
of
the
employer's
reasons.
apart
from
that,
what
evidence
of
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
age
was
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
um-hum.
justice
antonin
scalia
um-hum.
and
he
was
one
who
had
somewhat
different
qualifications
from
the
others?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
just
comes
in
and
says
we
have
a
policy
of...
this...
this
fellow
has
a
criminal
record.
we
have
a
policy
of
firing
people
with
a
criminal
record.
thank
you.
and
he
sits
down.
it's
not
doc...
he
doesn't
produce
any
documents
or
anything.
he
just
asserts
that,
and
the
defendant
does
nothing.
what
happens?
justice
antonin
scalia
company
plan.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
isn't
what
i
asked.
i'm
saying
we
don't
know
that.
all
the
employer
comes
in
with
is
the
assertion
that
he
has
such
a
policy
and
the
assertion
that
this
individual
has
a
criminal
record,
and
then
he
sits
down.
what
does
the
plaintiff
have
to
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
you
say
take
his
deposition
and
this
is
so
bad.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
who's
the
burden
on?
is
it...
is
it
the
employ...
is
it
the
employee's
burden
to
knock
that
down
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
he
didn't,
that
would
stand?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
he
didn't,
that
would
be
sufficient
to
refute
the
prima
facie
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
means
it's
not
enough
to
refute
the
prima
facie
case.
is
it
or
isn't
it?
it
is
or
it
isn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
if
the
employee
doesn't
come
in
with
something
to
refute
that,
it
would
not
go
to
the
jury;
you
could
have
summary
judgment?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sorry
that
that
wasn't
the
question
you
presented
to
us
when
you
asked
us
to
take
this
case.
the
question
presented
is
set
forth
in
your
petition
is
whether
a
plaintiff
who
alleges
intentional
discrimination
can
survive
summary
judgment
merely...
merely
by
questioning
his
employer's
business
judgment
without
presenting
any
evidence,
direct
or
indirect,
that
his
employer's
judgment
was,
in
fact,
motivated
by
an
intent
to
discrimination.
that's
an
interesting
question.
what
you've
just
been
talking
about
isn't.
