mr.
brian
j.
martin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
in
the
petition
was
whether
a
plaintiff
in
an
age
discrimination
case
can
take
his
case
to
a
jury
if
he
has
no
evidence
that
the
employer
intended
to
discriminate.
the
answer
to
that
question,
of
course,
is
no,
but
we
think
that
that
answer
and,
indeed,
that
question
have
little
to
do
with
this
case.
the
third
circuit
following
this
court's
guidance
and
summary
judgment
in
title
vii
cases
found
after
reviewing
the
evidence
that
a
reasonable
jury
could
find
that
petitioner
discriminated
against
mr.
brieck.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
well,
i
think
that's
right,
and
perhaps
it's
because
it's
an
unpublished
opinion
coming
shortly
after
their
en
banc
decision
in
chipollini.
they
may
have
considered
it
something
of
a
footnote
to
chipollini.
chipollini,
they're
more
explicit.
i
think
the
legal
analysis
of
the
third
circuit...
and
we
have
to
build
on
a
little
bit...
it's
not
as
express
as
it
should
be...
is
that
if
a
plaintiff
sets
forth
a
prima
facie
case
and
if
there's
enough
evidence
that
a
jury
can
disbelieve
the
proffered
explanation,
that
it's
really
a
lie
or
a
cover-up,
then
a
reasonable
jury
may
infer
intentional
discrimination.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
no,
definitely
not.
in
fact,
early
on
in
their
opinion
they
note
that
mr.
brieck
made
out
a
prima
facie
case.
it's
not
challenged.
and
then
they
continue
on
to
analyze
the
proffered
explanation.
i
believe
what
they're
saying
is
whenever
a
plaintiff
makes
a
prima
facie
case
and
there's
enough
evidence
that
a
reasonable
jury
could
believe
that
the
employer
is
not
telling
the
truth
about
its
business
judgment,
then
the
jury
may
infer
age
discrimination.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
the
prima
facie
case?
mr.
brian
j.
martin
well,
i
think
burdine
answers
that
question.
the
prima
facie
case
may
be
used
in
two
senses.
one,
it's
enough
to
get
to
a
jury.
two,
it's
really
a
legal
technique
involving
burdens
of
production,
sort
of
that
they're-bursting-the-bubble
type
of
presumption.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
well,
that's
right.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
well,
i
suspect
it
depends
on
the
context
of
the
litigation.
is
it
a
summary
judgment
motion?
is
it
a
motion
to
dismiss?
is
it
a
directed
verdict?
it
might
depend
on
those
types
of
cases.
but,
i
think
the
language
in
burdine
in
that
the
presumption
drops
from
the
case
would
mean
that
once
in
this
case,
as
in
aikens,
when
you
have
the
evidence
from
both
sides
in,
the
fact
that
there
was
a
prima
facie
case
is
really
not
very
relevant.
the
question
is
whether
a
reasonable
jury
could
find
on
the
basis
of
all
of
the
evidence
intentional
discrimination.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
i
believe
you
were
quoting
from
the
district
court's
opinion.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
we
think
that
the
third
circuit's
legal
analysis
that
a
reasonable
jury
may
infer,
may
find
intentional
discrimination
based
on
a
prima
facie
case,
plus
enough
evidence
to
disbelieve
the
employer
follows
directly
from
this
court's
decisions
in
furnco
construction
corporation
and
in
burdine.
the
court
in
furnco
noted
that
when
all
legitimate
explanations
for
the
employment
decision
are
eliminated,
it's
reasonable
to
infer
intentional
discrimination.
we
don't
believe
that
inference
is
mandatory.
the
plaintiff
would
not
get
a
directed
verdict.
they
may
be
covering
up
some
other
legal
motive.
you
can
imagine
perhaps
they
didn't
want
to
hurt
the
employee's
feelings
at
the
time,
so
they
made
up
some
story.
it's
not
a
mandatory
inference.
it's
a
reasonable
one,
and
that's
all
that's
required
in
this
case
to
get
to
a
jury.
we
noted
in
our
brief
that
this
is
an
unexceptional
case,
and
we
believe
that.
we
do
not
think
that
this
is
a
case
about
a
court
or
a
jury
second-guessing
a
legitimate
business
judgment.
was
it
fair?
was
it
efficient?
did
it
work
out?
the
question
in
this
case,
as
the
third
circuit
recognized,
is
whether
petitioner
really
made
such
a
legitimate
business
judgment.
and
the
third
circuit--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--no,
it
is
not
enough.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
what
is
required
is
what
is
required
in
any
summary
judgment
case,
enough
evidence
to
prove
your
case,
that
a
reasonable
jury
could
find
that
you've
proved
your
case.
in
this
case
that
means
proof
of
intentional
discrimination.
we
can
imagine
some
prima
facie
cases
where
the
evidence
that
the
plaintiff
presents
is
very
strong
at
that
stage
and
will
be
enough
to
get
to
a
jury.
we
can
imagine
other
cases
where
it
would
not
be.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
absolutely.
i
believe
that.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
yes,
your
honor.
i
agree.
to
return
to
my
point,
this
is
not
a
case
about
a
court
or
a
jury
second-guessing
a
legitimate
business
judgment,
was
it
fair
or
was
it
efficient.
the
question
is
whether
harbison-walker
acted
on
the
basis
of
a
legitimate
business
judgment.
of
course,
to
answer
that
question
you
have
to
examine
the
judgment.
you
cannot
take
it
at
face
value,
nor
assume
that
it's
false.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
that's
the
ultimate
question.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
i'm
not
sure
it's
quite
different.
if
you
have
a
prima
facie
case--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--um-hum.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
um-hum.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
if
it's
refuted
in
the
sense
that
i
could
find
that
was
not
the
basis
of
the
decision--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--then
i
may
infer
as
a
reasonable
person
that
the
employer
acted
on
the
basis
of
age,
that--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--you
have...
you
have
the
evidence
of
the
bare
bones
prima
facie
case.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
and--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--and
the
evidence
that
the
employer
is
lying,
that
they're
covering
up
something.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
i'm
saying
that
it's
a
legitimate
inference
based
on
all
that
evidence
that
he
acted
on
the
basis
of
some
illegal
criterion.
i'm
not
only
saying
that.
the
court's
saying
it.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
i
hear
you
saying
you
question
the...
whether
it's
appropriate
to
draw
an
inference
from
a
prima
facie
case
plus
proof
that
the
explanation
is
unworthy
of
credence.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
exactly.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
the
third
circuit
found
that
there
was
enough
evidence
for
a
jury
to
so
find
in
this
case.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
exactly.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
yes.
if
it's
merely
a
bare
bones
prima
facie
case,
the
weakest
possible
evidence
that
you
can
imagine,
which
would
qualify
as
a
prima
facie
case,
there's
a
totally
legitimate
explanation...
for
instance,
the
employee--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--was
convicted
of
armed
robbery.
that
is
not
enough,
in
our
view,
to
take
it
to
the
jury.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
yes,
your
honor.
thank
you.
