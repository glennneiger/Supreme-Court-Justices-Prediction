mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
a
legal
question
under
rule
56
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
of
whether
a
reasonable
jury
on
the
basis
of
the
entire
record
in
this
case
could
find
that
respondent
was
laid
off
and
not
recalled
because
of
his
age.
since
the
court
below
reversed
the
district
court's
grant
of
petitioner's
motion
for
summary
judgment,
it
is
first
appropriate
to
review
the
facts
underlying
this
matter.
petitioner
harbison-walker
provides
technology
and
specialized
refractory
products
to
high-temperature
natural
resource
industries,
the
largest
of
which
is
the
steel
industry.
as
the
business
fortunes
of
the
steel
industry
declined
in
the
early
eighties,
so
did
the
business
fortunes
of
harbison-walker.
between
1980
and
1982
harbison's
employment
was
reduced
from
approximately
5,400
employees
to
2,700
employees.
in
1982
sales
declined
some
31
percent,
the
posted
and
net
operating
loss
of
$21
million
or
$20.5
million,
and
employment
in
that
year
alone
was
reduced
38
percent.
in
making
decisions
as
to
which
groups
of
employees
would
be
laid
off,
harbison
considered
among
other
things
length
of
service
and
the
skills
necessary
to
perform
work
in
a
reduced
work
environment.
among
the
employees
hardest
hit
by
the
downturn
were
those
working
in
the
company's
iron
and
steel
marketing
group.
within
that
group
were
four
installation
specialists.
respondent
who
at
the
time
of
this
action
was
aged
55
with
17
years
of
service;
mr.
malarich,
aged
59
with
approximately
16
years
of
service;
mr.
faust,
aged
39
with
approximately
16
years
of
service;
and
mr.
meixell,
aged
59
with
approximately
two
and
one
half
years
of
service.
because
of
a
substantial
reduction
in
shipments,
petitioner
elected
in
early
july
1982
to
lay
off,
among
others,
two
of
its
installation
specialists,
the
respondent
who
was
55
years
old,
and
mr.
meixell,
who
was
59
but
was
the
least
senior
of
the
installation
specialists.
petitioner
retained
the
59-year-old,
mr.
malarich,
and
the
39-year-old,
mr.
faust,
because
they
possessed
more
diverse
or
versatile
skills
and
had
higher
job
performance
evaluations.
mr.
faust,
the
39-year-old,
had
previously
worked
for
petitioner
as
a
sales
correspondent,
and
his
work
duties
included
pricing
and
margin
work,
which
work
he
continued
to
perform
after
he
became
an
installation
specialist.
the
skills
of
pricing
and
margin
work
were
skills
that
respondent
concedes
and
the
courts
below
found
he
did
not
have
and
would
require
training
to
perform.
faust
had
before
his--
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
--yes.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
yes.
the
courts
noted
that
there
was
no
record
evidence
to
support
the
assertion,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
mr.
brieck,
the
respondent
in
this
case,
had
performed
that
work
while
employed
at
harbison,
and
there
is
an
affidavit
at
pages
52
and
53
in
the
record
from
the
respondent
himself
in
which
he
concedes
that,
in
fact,
those
were
jobs
that
he
had
not
performed
but,
to
the
extent
he
had
not,
he
could
be
easily
trained
to
perform
them.
prior
to
the
layoffs
in
question,
mr.
faust,
the
39-year-old,
had
spent
approximately
60
percent
of
his
time
doing
office
work
and
40
percent
of
his
time
doing
installation
work
outside
of
the
office.
business
conditions
worsened.
in
late
july
of
1982,
mr.
malarich,
the
59-year-old,
was
laid
off.
three
months
later,
mr.
faust
himself,
was
laid
off.
in
the
spring
of
1983,
mr.
malarich,
the
59-year
old,
was
recalled,
first
on
a
temporary
and
then
on
a
permanent
basis.
in
the
summer
of
1983,
mr.
malarich,
the
59-year-old,
at
that
time
approximately
approaching
60,
indicated
to
petitioner
that
he
was
going
to
elect
to
retire
that
fall.
at
that
time
petitioner
recalled
mr.
faust,
the
39-year-old.
after
his
recall
mr.
faust
in
deposition
testimony
stated
he
performed
approximately
75
percent
of
his
work
doing
installation
work
outside
the
office,
25
percent
doing
office
work,
an
undetermined
amount
of
which
was
pricing
and
margin
work.
of
the
12
individuals
laid
off
from
petitioner's
iron
and
steel
marketing
group
between
july
and
november
1982,
75
percent
were
under
the
age
of
40,
and
one
of
the
three
who
was
over
the
age
of
40
who
was
laid
off,
was
subsequently
recalled,
mr.
malarich.
of
the
21
remaining
employees
after
the
layoffs
took
place,
over
half
were
over
the
age
of
40
and
over
half
of
that
group
were
over
the
age
of
50.
within
two
weeks
or...
yeah,
within
two
weeks,
excuse
me,
of
his
july
layoff,
respondent
filed
the
charge
of
age
discriminations.
approximately
two
years
later,
he
filed
the
lawsuit
challenging
among
other
things
his
layoff
and
his
failure
to
recall
on
the
basis
of
age
discrimination.
full-scale
discovery
commenced,
and
harbison
subsequently
moved
the
district
court
for
summary
judgment.
the
district
court
granted
this
motion.
the
district
court
found
first
in
a
reduction-in-force
case
there
is
not
an
onerous
burden
to
establish
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
and,
in
fact,
found
that
a
prima
facie
case
was
made
solely
because
of
the
fact
that
respondent
was
55
years
old
at
the
time
of
his
layoff
and
had
been
qualified
to
be
an
installation
specialist.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
no,
not
at
all.
and,
in
fact,
at
this
stage,
justice
white,
it's
really
a
question
of
whether
a
reasonable
jury
could
conclude
because
at
this
point
in
time--
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
--no,
it
was
made
out,
and
we
have
no
challenge
to
that.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
yes,
that's
right.
and,
in
fact,
at
that
time
in
light
of
texas
department
of
community
affairs
v.
burdine,
the
burden
of
production
then
shifted
to
my
client
to
produce
a
legitimate,
nondiscriminatory
reason
for
its
actions.
the
district
court
found
that
this
was
satisfied
since,
in
fact,
three
of
the
five
years
before
the
layoff
the
petitioner
had
rated
mr.
faust
higher
than
the
respondent
and
that,
in
fact,
there
was
no
doubt
that
mr.
faust
possessed
the
diverse
skills
that
respondent
or
that
petitioner
contended
it
was
going
to
use
as
one
of
its
guides
as
to
who
would
be
laid
and
who
would
be
recalled.
the
district
court
then
went
on
to
reject
respondent's
effort
to
show
that
these
reasons
were
a
pretext
for
discrimination.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
yes,
justice
white.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
mr.
chief
justice,
the...
if...
plaintiff
has
ample
opportunity
to
show
pretext.
that
wasn't
the
decision.
and
that
could
simply
be
that
there
was
competing
inferences,
that
a
reasonable
jury
could
conclude
despite
the
reason
that
we
asserted
that
it
was
still
a
basis
for
discrimination.
at
at
that
time
summary
judgment
is
not
appropriate,
and
we
are
not
contending
otherwise.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
if
there
is
facts
in
the
record
which
could
allow
a
reasonable
jury
to
conclude
that
he
was
a
victim
of
age
discrimination.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
that's
right.
and
we
contend
in
this
case
that
a
reasonable
jury
could
not
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
in
this
record
conclude
that
he
was
a
victim
of
age
discrimination.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
yes.
well,
the
criticism
because
we're
on
review
of
that
decision
but,
at
the
same
point,
i
would
not,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
fact
that
there
are
factual
disputes
does
not
preclude
summary
judgment.
they
have
to
be
genuine
factual
disputes.
i
would
submit
that
what
respondent
has
attempted
to
do
in
its
brief
raised
a
number
of
potential
factual
issues
are
neither
material
nor
genuine
in
the
sense
of
requiring
a
verdict
in
respondent's
favor
if
accepted.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
yes.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
yes.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
at
any
of
these
stages
and,
in
particular--
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
--yes.
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
a
reasonable
jury
could
for
purposes
of
summary
judgment
in
this
case
could
conclude
that
the
respondent
was
a
victim
of
age
discrimination.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
well,
it
depends--
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
--it
depends--
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
--all
right.
it
doesn't
have
to
go
to
the
jury
unless
you
conclude
that
if
i
look
at
the
respondent's
evidence,
i
look
at
petitioner's
evidence,
and
let's
assume
that
there's
competing
inferences
that
can
be
drawn
from
that
evidence.
then
that
case
should
go
to
the
jury.
we
do
not
dispute
the
fact
that
this
court,
whether
it
be
in
celotex,
anderson,
matsushita
v.
zenith,
what
it
established
was
was
whether
a
reasonable
jury
could
so
conclude.
what
we
contend
is
first,
the
court
of
appeals
was
in
error
in
terms
of
the
legal
standard
under
rule
56
under
which
it
reviewed
the
evidence
in
this
case.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
well,
that's
right.
in
fact,
this
court
noted
in
burdine
and
it
also
stated,
in
fact,
in
mcdonnell
douglas
itself
that
a
prima
facie
showing
is
not
the
equivalent
of
a
factual
finding
of
discrimination.
indeed,
this
court
in
burdine
held--
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
--that's
right.
and
aikens
dealt
with
the
third
thing
in
terms
of
the
factual
finding
of
discrimination.
what's
present
n
this
case,
however,
is
the
court
of
appeals
in
reversing
the
district
court's
grant,
the
district
court
contrary
to
the
statements
both
in
respondent's
brief
and
the
brief
of
the
united
states,
did
not
simply
find,
petitioner's
reason
plausible.
the
district
court
reconsidered
its
decision
at
plaintiff's
request,
at
respondent's
request.
in
its
decision
upon
reconsideration
it
reviewed
the
evidentiary
burdens,
it
reviewed
the
evidence,
and
it
concluded
that
a
reasonable
jury
could
not
find
age
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
in
the
record.
the
court
of
appeals
in
a
2:
1
opinion
disagreed
solely
because
the
court
said
there
was
a
potential
inconsistency.
it
said
that
since
mr.
faust
had
admittedly
or...
had
been
retained
in
part
because
of
his
admitted
diverse
skills,
that
after
his
recall,
he
only
spent
25
percent
of
his
time
on
office
matters;
75
percent
of
the
time,
according
to
the
court
below,
were
spent
on
installation
matters.
and
since
of
that
25
percent
only
a
small
amount
might
have
been
the
type
of
work
that
respondent
could
perform,
that
that
was,
in
and
of
itself,
sufficient
to
send
it
to
a
jury.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
well,
no,
it
actually...
it
elevated
the
case
immediately
to
the
stage...
it
never
reviewed
the
plaintiff's
case
and,
more
importantly,
it
never
reviewed
the
petitioner's
evidence
in
this
case.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
well,
i
would
submit
that
if
this
court
has
rejected
anderson
in
first
national
bank
v.
city
services
and
matsushita
v.
zenith,
there
mere
fact
that
there
could
be
credibility
determinations
or
that
in
anderson
the
issue
of
intent
is
not
enough
to
go
before
a
jury.
now,
it
might
be,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
a
given
affidavit
might
be
susceptible
to
inferences
in
light
of
competing
evidence
from
which
to
conclude
discrimination.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
oh,
it
can
disregard
it.
but
what
i'm
only
saying
is
is
that...
i
thought
you
were
saying
something
else
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
maybe
a
were
credibility
dispute
is
enough
to
say
that
summary
judgment
should
not
be
granted.
it
can,
in
fact,
consider
evidence
with
respect
to
the
interest
of
the
party
just
as
it
can
consider
the
interest
of
the
respondent
to
make
conclusory
or
self-proclaimed
assessments
as
to
his
or
her
performance.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
well,
under
celotex
we
were
not
required,
a
petitioner
was
not
required
to
negate
the
claim.
however,
it
could
and
it
did
in
this
case.
petitioner
in
this
case
went
forward
and
said
accept
all
of
the
evidence,
and
i
ask
this
court
to.
you
have
to
accept
all
the
favorable
inferences
that
can
be
drawn
from
the
evidence
that
respondent
presents
to
you.
accept
that.
accept
all
of
the
findings
or
all
of
the
facts
that
can
be
drawn
in
favor
of
respondent.
you
cannot
find
age
discrimination
in
this
case.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
there
is
no
question
and
we've
not
doubted,
justice
stevens,
that
you
can
establish
pretext
that
way.
however,
you
have
to
go
back
and
look
at
the
entire
record
evidence.
the
entire
record
evidence--
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
--yes,
if
the
trier
of
fact
on
the
basis
of
the
record
as
a
whole
can
find
this
pretext
to
be
drawn,
i
would
point
out--
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
--an
inference
of
pretext,
but
i
would
point,
however,
that's
the
problem
here.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
the
record
here
can
only
establish
one
potential
according
to
the
court
below
in
consistency.
it
would
say
that
in
essence,
and
i
would
just
point
out...
for
example,
the
brief
of
the
united
states
contends
that
we
do
not
believe
you
can
establish
pretext
because
the
reason
is
unbelievable,
that
that's
not
unworthy
of
credence.
well,
if
anything,
the
opposite
is
here.
in
a
reduction-in-force
situation--
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
--oh,
no,
no,
no.
i'm
saying
the
government
says
that
we're
taking
the
position
that
that
is
our
position.
and
i'm
saying
that
is
not
our
position
at
all.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
our
position
is,
is
that
to
establish
pretext
though
unworthy
of
credence
you
have
to
show
that
it
is
reasonable
to
infer
on
the
basis
of
the
record
as
a
whole
that
discrimination
took
place.
take
a
look
at
this
record.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
you
can
if
the
reason
is
itself
subject
to
some
unbelievable...
or
other
facts
would
show
it's
either
false,
that
it's
ridden
with
error,
that
it's
so
questionable
on
its
face
that
one
can
infer,
perhaps,
but
that's
certainly
not
this
case.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
well,
first,
justice
scalia,
all
of
this
court's
cases
say
it
must
be
a
pretext
for
discrimination.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
and
that
you
can
have
a
reasonable
jury
conclude
on
the
basis
of
the
record
that,
in
fact,
it
was
for
discriminatory
reasons.
the
burden
at
all
times
in
this
case--
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
--no.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
this
court
in
furnco
said
that
employers
are
presumed
to
act
for
legitimate
rational
reasons
and,
therefore,
if
an
employer
gives
an
objectively
false
reason,
it
seems
to
me
an
inference
can
be
drawn
that
that
reason
may
be
pretextual.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
the
courts
below--
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
--ruled
that
it
could
be
an
inference
that
the
employer
acted
for
discriminatory
reasons.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
no.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
justice
stevens...
what
you
need
to
do,
though,
in
either
case
is
go
back
and
look
to
the
entire
record
to
see
whether
or
not
it
is
possible
to
infer
discriminatory
motive
because--
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
--well,
first
of
all,
this
case
doesn't
involve
any
allegation
of
falsehood.
this
case--
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
--but--
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
--but
this
court
in
all
of
its
summary
judgment
cases
such
as
anderson,
celotex,
matsushita
v.
zenith,
have
clearly
rejected
the
notion
that
one
particular
piece
of
evidence
that
you
can
cite
is
enough
to
be
probative
where
you
look
to
the
substantive
evidentiary
burdens
that
are
still
entailed
on
the
respondent
in
this
case.
at
no
time
did
respondent
in
this
case
lose
the
substantive
evidentiary
burden
of
requiring
to
show
that
his
layoff
and
failure
to
be
recalled
were
reasons
of
age.
i
would
contend,
justice
stevens,
that
it
seems
to
me
that
a
record
that
shows
that
the
individual
first
recalled
was
59
years
old,
that
the
individual
who
was
then
recalled
was
39,
that
the
inference
of
age
in
terms
of
this
record
shows
that
what
the
court
really
was
doing,
was
saying
merely
casting
doubt
on
the
employer's
business
decision
is
enough.
not
any
language
with
respect
that
it
be
a
pretext
for
discrimination.
our
quarrel
isn't
looking
at
the
record
as
a
whole
and
saying
whether
or
not
you
can
infer
pretext...
excuse
me...
infer
discriminatory
motive.
you
have
to
look
at
the
record
as
a
whole
to
infer
discriminatory
motive.
the
court
below,
however,
makes
no
reference
at
all
to
the
question
of
discriminatory
motive.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
if
the
employer--
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
--the
employer--
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
--the
employer
bears
the
burden
of
production,
and
that
burden
is
to
articulate
the
legitimate
nondiscriminatory
reason.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
and
he...
well--
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
--if...
no.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
if
you
can
show
that
the
reason
is
false...
let's
assume
that
occurs.
the
reason
is
false,
and
it's
shown,
but
it's
also
shown
that
the
reason
is
false
for
nonprohibited
reasons...
just
a
stupid
business
mistake...
that
what
it
was
based
on
had
nothing
to
do
with
age
or
race
or
sex.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
well,
the
reason
doesn't
go.
the
reason
doesn't
go.
the
ultimate
burden
is
still
for
the
court
to
determine
whether
a
discriminatory
act
took
place.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
because
you
have
to
look
at
the
statutory
basis
of
the
lawsuit.
the
statutory
basis
of
the
lawsuit
isn't
that
you
made
a
stupid
business
mistake
and
can
be
penalized
for
it.
the
statutory
basis
for
the
lawsuit
is
i
was
laid
off
or
i
was
failed
to
be
recalled
because
of
my
age.
and
if
the
record
establishes,
justice
white,
that
age
was
not
a
factor
in
that
decision,
even
though
the
employer
acted
erroneously,
the
employer
should
not
be
held
liable
for
a
violation
of
the
age
discrimination
act.
it
might
be
engaged
in
some
other
types
of
activity
that
might
be
in
violation
of
some
contractual
rights
or
other
rights,
but
it
certainly
isn't
in
violation
of
the
age
discrimination
act.
and
that's
the
problem
with
the
court
below
here.
the
court
below's
focus
here
is
not
on
the
age
discrimination
act.
the
court
below's
focus
is,
is
that
if
i
can
raise
a
doubt
in
the
employer's
reason,
ipso
facto,
that
creates
a
jury
issue
without,
as
we
submit,
following
the
dictates
of
this
court
in
anderson
and
celotex,
which
says
that
a
reasonable
jury
must
conclude
on
the
basis
of
the
entire
record,
not
one
piece
of
it.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
that's
right.
you
would
have
questions
of
credibility
prevail
in
every
case.
so,
therefore,
if
intent's
a
factor,
you
would
never
have
summary
judgment
at
all.
and
what
we
contend
simply
in
this
case
is,
the
court
below's
standard
was
a
standard
premise,
not
on
looking
at
the
issue
of
pretext
for
discrimination
or
discrimination
because
in
a
given
case,
perhaps,
a
false
reason
will...
perhaps...
be
enough
to
infer
on
the
basis
of
that
record
that
the
employer
acted
for
some
elicit
reason.
and
the
court
noted
that
in
furnco.
what
is
inconsistent
here
is,
is
that
the
court's
below
focus
was
never
on
age.
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
entire
record
and
take
a
look
at
the
evidence
with
respect
to
age,
one
must
conclude
that
a
reasonable
jury
could
not
have
found
age
discrimination.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
yes.
a
prima
facie
case--
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
--does
not
in
and
of
itself
get
to
a
jury.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
if
you
don't
answer
it
satisfactorily.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
yes.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
doesn't
destroy
the
facts
underlying
that
case.
it
destroys
the
presumption
is
what
burdine
said
of
legally
mandated
discrimination.
it
is
not...
and
that
was
not
first
held,
i
would
submit,
justice
white,
in
burdine.
it
was
held
in
mcdonnell
douglas--
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
--where
that
was
initially
stated.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
yes,
it
does.
it
says,
"unworthy
of
credence
and
it
can
be
established
for
pretext.
"
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
he
would
be
better
off
actually
in
that
scenario
putting
in
a
false
reason.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
but
that
would
be
the
context
in
which
that
would
be.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
well,
a
prima
facie
case,
according
to
this
court--
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
--no.
a
prima
facie
case
establishes
a
presumption
of
rebuttable
presumption
of
discrimination.
this
court
in
burdine
said
that
the
employer
then
has
a
burden
of
articulating
a
legitimate
nondiscriminatory
reasons.
if
it
articulates
that
reason,
it
goes
to
the
next
stage.
the
employer
runs
a
risk
of
being
silent
at
that
stage
because
the
inference
that
is
raised
under
mcdonnell
douglas
v.
green
is
that
the
prima
facie
case
then
has
not
been
rebutted
and
while
it's
a
rebuttable
presumption
of
discrimination,
it
nonetheless
exists
in
terms
of
its
presumption.
so,
its
presumptive
effect
has
not
in
any
way
been
rebutted
by
the
employer
in
that
sense.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
well,
it
would...
excuse
me,
justice
white.
if
you're
saying
it
doesn't...
in
a
sense
it
doesn't
mean
the
employer
has
a
verdict
against
them?
is
that
what
you're
saying?
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
yes.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
yes.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
well,
i
would
say
that,
number
one,
we
have
never
said
they
should
be
disregarded,
but
it
is
not
enough
for
a
jury
determination
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
prima
facie
case,
unless
a
reasonable
jury
could
so
conclude
that
there
was
a
discrimination.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
and
that
we
submit
on
the
basis
of
this
record
is
a
reason
why
the
court
below
should
be
reversed.
i
would
like
to
have
any
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
just
quickly,
your
honors,
the
issue
here
is
whether
a
reasonable
jury
could
conclude
that
there
was
age
discrimination.
we
would
submit
you
have
to
look
at
the
entire
record
and
the
facts
from
which
the
court
of
appeals
inferred
that
a
jury
could
determine
age
discrimination
was
insufficient.
they
took
one
particular
piece
of
evidence,
held
it
up
to
a
probative
value
that
can't
rise
to
any
inference
in
light
of
the
entire
record
of
age
discrimination.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
it
is
involving
two
important
principles.
the
court
below
said
you
could
look
at
one
piece
of
evidence
and
not
the
entire
record
as
a
whole.
as
a
dissent
of
the
court
below
said,
that
was
inconsistent
with
this
court's
opinion
in
anderson
and
in
celotex.
number
two,
the
standard
that
the
court
would
apply
into
the
ada
is
one
which
really
does
not
deal
with
the
ultimate
question
of
discrimination,
but
simply
whether
or
not
you
can
raise
a
sufficient
question
of
the
judgment
itself
so
as
to
allow
a
jury
then
to
infer
discrimination.
thank
you
very
much.
