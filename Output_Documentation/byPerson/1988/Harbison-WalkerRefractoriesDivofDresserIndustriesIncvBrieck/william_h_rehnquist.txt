chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
on
number
87-271,
harbison-walker
refractories
versus
eugene
brieck.
mr.
kramer,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kramer,
when
you
say,
"the
courts
below
found",
this
came
up
on
summary
judgment,
so
you're
obligated,
of
course,
to
take
the
facts
against
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
to
the
extent
that
they
can
be.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
after
step
two
of
the
burdine
phase
where
the
plaintiff
has
shown
a
prima
facie
case,
and
you
have
articulated
a
reason
whereby
the...
a
legitimate
reason,
a
nondiscriminatory
reason
for
his
treatment,
still
if
a
plaintiff
has
introduced
enough
to
satisfy...
to
prove
his
case
to
a
jury--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
supposing
the
plaintiff
says,
you
know,
i
have
proved
the
following
facts,
and
i
think,
trial
judge,
that
a
reasonable
jury
could
infer
discrimination
from
that.
now,
that
should
mean
if
he's
right,
that
should
mean
a
denial
of
the
summary
judgment
motion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
now,
the
respondents
in
their
brief
submit
a
number
of
additional
facts
which
don't
seem
to
have
been
mentioned
either
by
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
as
saying
that
if
you
take
all
these
facts,
there
would
have
been
enough
evidence.
but,
i
take
it
your
criticism
is
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
handled
this
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
do
agree
that
the
test,
the
trial
court
and
every
court
should
have
applied
is,
has
the
plaintiff
adduced
sufficient
evidence
to
support
a
finding
of
discrimination.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
believed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
it
have
to
go
to
the
jury?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
also
saying,
are
you
not,
that
what
is
a
prima
facie
case
under
mcdonnell
douglas,
just
showing
you're
a
member
of
the
protective
class
and
so
on,
well,
is
not
necessarily
enough
to
get
you
to
the
jury.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
still
a
third
thing.
a
prima
facie
showing
under
mcdonnell
is
one
thing.
sufficient
evidence
to
get
to
the
jury
is
a
second
thing,
and
a
factual
finding
of
discrimination
is
the
third
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
court
of
appeals
really
never
examined
the
plaintiff's
case,
did
it?
it
just
said
that
you
could
poke
holes
in
the
stage
two
articulation
of
a
neutral
reason.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
should
it
have
reviewed
the
petitioner's
evidence
since,
you
know...
if
you
put
a
manager
on...
if
you
submit
a
manager's
affidavit
in
a
summary
judgment
proceeding,
the
jury's
entitled
to
disbelieve
everything
the
manager
says.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
telling
me
i'm
wrong
then
in
saying
that
a
district
court
on
summary
judgment
motion
can
disregard
the
testimony
of
an
interested
party
who
is
seeking
summary
judgment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
party...
i
thought
the
party
moving
for
summary
judgment
had
to
discount
all
evidence
adduced
by
him
simply
because
if
it's
from
an
interested
party,
it
could
be
disbelieved.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you'd
never
get
a
summary
judgment
on
behalf
of
the
employer
in
one
of
these
cases
if
the
possibility
of
disbelieving
the
employer's
articulation
of
a
reason
meant
that
summary
judgment
was
out.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then,
burdine
tends
to
confirm
that
when
it
says
that
if
a
prima...
if
the
defendant
meets
his
burden
at
stage
two,
the
presumption
raised
by
the
prima
facie
case
is
rebutted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kramer.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
martin.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
the
third
circuit
saying
that
every
time
a
plaintiff
makes
a
prima
facie
case,
which
is
simply
showing
that
in
this
case
he's
a
member
of
the
protected
class
and
he
was
discharged,
that
is
always
enough
to
get
to
the
jury?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
martin,
i
have
found
at
page
15a
of
the
petition
the
statement
of
the
third
circuit
in
this
case,
that
"the
burden
of
making
out
a
prima
facie
case
is
not
onerous,
and
we
find
that
plaintiff
has
done
so.
"
now,
you
say
somewhere
else
in
that
opinion
they
say
that
the
plaintiff
has
produced
enough
evidence
to
go
to
a
jury
on
the
issue
of
discrimination.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
perhaps
you're
right.
go
ahead
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
don't
have
proof
when
you're
talking
about
summary
judgment.
all
you're
talking
about
is
possible
inferences.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
said
proof
as
if
the
jury
had
found
that
the
employer's
explanation
was
not
good.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
mean
an
argument
or
facts
from
which
a
jury
might
conclude?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
martin.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
logan.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
all
right.
are
you
satisfied,
mr.
logan,
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
address
itself
to
the
question
of
whether
plaintiff
had
made
out
a
showing
sufficiently...
sufficient
to
get
to
the
jury?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
you
just
mention
where
it
is
in
its
opinion
that
it
says
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
really
is
just
the
plaintiff's
effort
to
break
down
the
employer's
explanation.
i--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
then,
will
it
ever
be
possible
for
an
employer
to
get
a
summary
judgment
in
a
case
like
this?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
mean
where
an
employer
produces
a
bare
bones
prima
facie
case,
and
an
employer
comes
up
with
some
explanation
which
on
summary
judgment
the
jury
might
disbelieve.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
logan.
mr.
kramer,
you
have
one
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kramer.
the
case
is
submitted.
