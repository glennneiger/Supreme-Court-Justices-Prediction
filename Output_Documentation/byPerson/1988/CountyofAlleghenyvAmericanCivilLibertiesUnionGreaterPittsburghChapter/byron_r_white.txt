--well,
mr.
lewin,
why
wouldn't
the
city
have
to
open
up
its
steps
on
another
holiday
for
another
religious
faith?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
if
a
religion
says
we
have
no
business...
we
haven't
any
interest
in
putting
our
symbol
up
there
at
christmas
time.
that
is...
we
don't
celebrate
at
christmas
time.
we
celebrate
some
other
time.
and
the
city
should
show
its...
show
that
it
isn't
discriminating
or
endorsing
a
particular
religion
on
another
day.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
doesn't
it
have--
justice
byron
r.
white
--doesn't
it
have
to
be
a
public
forum?
otherwise,
the
city
is
saying,
"this
is
not
a
public
forum.
"
"we've
got
a
perfect
right
to
confine
this...
the
use
of
these
steps
to
one
religion.
"
justice
byron
r.
white
the
majority
religion.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
here's
steps
that
are
thrown
open
to
religious
symbols
by
a
majority
faith.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
has
to
be
a
public
forum
for
this
purpose?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
that
purpose
only.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
defending
lynch?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would...
i
would
suppose
under
your
theory
it
wouldn't
make...
it
wouldn't
help...
it
wouldn't
help
the
city
much
if
it
welcomed
everybody
on
the...
all
religions
on
the
front
step.
i
would
think
that
would
be
favoring
religion.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that...
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
still
be
here--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if--
justice
byron
r.
white
--there
were
ten
different
ones,
i
suppose
each
one
of
them
would
be
denominational.
