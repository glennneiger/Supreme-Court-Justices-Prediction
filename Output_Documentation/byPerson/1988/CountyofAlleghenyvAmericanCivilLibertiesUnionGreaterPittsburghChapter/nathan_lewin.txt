mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
irony
of
this
case
insofar
as
it
applies
to
the
menorah
is
that
an
apparently
successful
effort
on
the
part
of
the
city
of
pittsburgh
to
demonstrate
to
its
population
neutrality
with
regard
to
all
religions
by
displaying
a
symbol
which
is
religious
as
well
as
nonreligious
to
the
jewish
community
is
being
attacked
as
violating
the
establishment
clause.
the
holiday
season
that
is
involved
here
is,
of
course,
a
season
which
is
recognized
throughout
the
united
states,
and
throughout
the
world
indeed,
but
principally
because
its
focus
is
a
day
that
has
become
a
secular
holiday
but
has
very
substantial
religious
overtones
to
the
majority
population
in
this
country.
it
is
not
from
the
vantage
point
of
the
jewish
faith
a
time
of
a
principal
holiday
that
jews
celebrate.
it
happens
to
be
a
time
when
there
is
also
a
minor
jewish
festival,
which
is
the
festival
of
chanukah.
and,
therefore,
to
demonstrate
to
the
citizens
of
pittsburgh
its
respect
for
minority
faiths,
the
city
erected
immediately
adjacent
to
a
very
large
christmas
tree...
and
we
have
a
photograph
at
page
4
of
our
petition
of
the
scene...
a
45-foot
high
christmas
tree.
immediately
adjacent
to
that,
an
18-foot
high
menorah.
and
we
submit
that,
given
the
context,
that
is
a
perfectly
appropriate
and
permissible
educational
effort
on
the
part
of
the
state.
this
court
has
said
repeatedly
ever
since
its
opinion
in
abington
and
schempp
that
even
actions,
things
that
are
not
passive,
but
things
such
as
bible
readings,
that
are
done
for
instructional
purposes
for
religion
generally
are
permissible.
and
we
submit
that
taken
in
proper
context
what
this
menorah
does
at...
a
time
of
a
major
christian
holiday
is
it
advises
the
citizenry
that
there
are
other
faiths
that
celebrate
at
that
very
same
time--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--their
own
holidays.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
our--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--we
argue
alternatively,
justice
stevens,
that
under
larson
and
valente
there
is
a
basis
for
such
an
argument.
we
are
not
presented
with
that,
of
course,
in
this
case.
but
we
think
that
given
the
overwhelming
christian
nature
of
an
exhibit
such
as
either
a
creche
or
a
christmas
tree,
if
a
jewish
group,
or
indeed
any
other
group,
were
to
approach--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--were
to
approach
the--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--city
and
it
were
possible--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--we
think
that
a
city
that
has
a
place,
such
as
the
steps
of
city
hall,
or
something,
where
it
could
put
other
symbols,
should
not
discriminate
among
religions
and
should--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--in
fact--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--put
other
symbols
there
as
well.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
frankly,
i
think
a
religious
group
that
is
a
bona
fide
religious
group.
it
needn't
be
very
large.
it
may
say,
at
that
time,
"we
would
like
to
have
some
indication
of
our
faith.
"
at
that
time.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
again--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--i
think
it's--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--it's--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--no,
i
don't...
it's
not
a
majority
rule,
justice
stevens.
but
i
think
it...
it's
really
a
question...
i
think
an
impracticality--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--and
i
think
that
for...
indeed,
if,
for
example,
the
city
of
pittsburgh
had
a
public
forum
which
was
open
to
religious
faiths
to
conduct
meetings
on,
it
would
be
guided
by
the
same
the
standard.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
in
this
case
the
evidence,
frankly,
doesn't
support
the
public
forum
position
because
there
was
no
effort
made
at
the
trial
level
to
demonstrate
that
the
steps
of
city
hall
were
a
public
forum.
we
were
denied
leave
to
intervene
at
that
stage
of
the
case
and
no
party
made
that...
made
that
showing.
however,
it
would
be
precisely
the
mccreary
case,
your
honor.
if
in
fact
there
is
a
public
forum
and
there
is
a
bona
fide
group
and
the
group
says,
"look,
we
should
be
entitled
to
some
representation.
"
i
think
given
limitations
on
time,
place
and
manner,
which
this
court
has
regularly
applied
in
these
situations,
i
think
a
state
has
an
obligation
not
to
discriminate
among
religious
faiths.
but,
of
course,
again,--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--no,
they
need
not
be
the
same
size,
justice
scalia.
they...
again,
i
think
a
rule
of
reason
applies.
if
you've
got
a
limited
space
and
there
are
groups
that
want
to
have
some
display
at
that
time,
to
show
respect
for
that
group
i
think
the
city
does
have
an
obligation
not
to
convey
to
its
population
there's
only
one
faith
in
this
country
and
that
faith
is
the
christian
faith
that
celebrates
christmas
as
a
religious
holiday.
and
that's
really
what
is
done
at
christmas
time
in
terms
of
minorities.
the
minorities,
whether
they
are
the
jewish
minority,
or
the
moslem
minority
that
celebrate
their
principal
holidays
at
other
times,
are
surrounded
in
our
society
by
many,
many
symbols
that
indicate
the
majority
faith.
and
the
problems
with
regard
to
endorsement...
i
think
that
justice
brennen
pointed
out
in
his
dissent
in
lynch
and
donnelly...
apply
when
you
have
a
symbol
of
a
majority
faith
because
that
appears
to
be
the
state
endorsing
it.
but
there
could
be
no
realistic
appraisal
on
the
part
of
anybody
who
saw
that
menorah
standing
next
to
the
christmas
tree
that
pittsburgh,
which
is
not
more
than
10
percent
jewish
population,
is
encouraging
its
citizens
to
become
jewish
and
is
endorsing
the
jewish
faith.
that's
a
totally
unrealistic
appraisal
of
what
that
menorah
is,
even
if
the
menorah
is
a
religious
symbol.
because
all
that
it
is,
in
that
context,
is
educational.
and
to
answer
justice
o'connor's
question
as
it
might
apply
to
a
jewish
ceremony,
if
there
were
a
jewish
ceremony...
and,
again,
this
case
does
not
involve
a
ceremony
surrounding
the
menorah...
but
if
there
were
a
jewish
ceremony,
we
submit
in
the
context
of
the
holiday
season
and
the
display
it
would
be
an
educational
or
instructional
ceremony.
if
jews
are
permitted
even
on
the
steps
of
city
hall
to
light
a
menorah
in
that
context,
it's
not
the
state
encouraging
people
to
light
menorahs,
it's
the
state
saying
to
the
citizens
of
pittsburgh,
"look
at
this
object.
"
"to
a
minority
faith,
which
are
not
second-class
citizens
in
the
united
states,
that
is
a
respected
tradition.
"
"and
we
want
you
to
learn
about
that
tradition.
"
and
that's
really
all
that
pittsburgh
has
done
in
this
context.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's...
i
submit,
justice
white,
that...
that's
a
much
more
difficult
question
than
when
it
is
already
opening
it
up
to
the
majority
faith.
in
other
words,
if--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--quite
frankly,
justice
white,
if...
if
there
were
a,
a
public
forum
that
was
opened
up
to
christian
ceremonies
at
christmas
time,
then
i
think
it
would
be
appropriate
to
say
to
a
minority
faith,
"at
the
time
of
your
religious
holiday
that
public
forum
should
be
available
as
well.
"
and
we
submit
that
there
are
cases,
certainly,
that
this
court
has
decided
that
have
said
that
you
can't
discriminate
against
religion.
and
consequently,
the
court
has
held
that
public
forums
have
to
be
open
for
religious
meetings,
if
they
are
open
for
nonreligious
meetings.
and,
and
we
submit
that
if
there
were
a
public
forum,
if
there
were
evidence
that
this
was
a
public
forum,
then
if
there
were
a
christian
ceremony
conducted
on
the
public
forum,
there
should
be
a
jewish
or
a
moslem
ceremony
if
there
is
an
application
for
them.
and
i
think
that's--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--an
answer
to
justice
scalia.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
i
don't
think--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--i
think
if
there
is
an
area
that
is
not
thrown
open
to
public
meetings
and,
therefore,
there
is
no
evidence
that
it
is
a
public
forum--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--if
the
steps
are
thrown
open
to
religious
symbols
by
a
majority
faith,
then
i
think
that
they
are
a
public
forum
as
to
which
a
minority
faith
may
say,
"we
should
also
be
entitled
to
have
our
religious
symbol
on
those
steps.
"
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
i
agree.
it
would
have
to
be
a
public
forum.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
creche
conveys
a
religious
message.
we
believe
the
christmas
tree
contains
an
element
of
a
religious
message.
and
the
menorah
is...
conveys
a
religious
message
although
we...
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
menorah
has
significance
other
than
religious
significance
as
well.
mr.
nathan
lewin
of
course
we're...
yes,
we
stand--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--firmly
behind
lynch.
we
think,
though,
in
this
case
this
goes
far
beyond
lynch.
in
other
words,
we
think
in
this
case
even
the
dissenters
in
lynch
should
recognize
that
the
menorah
in
terms
of
its
instructional
value
is
permissible
in
this
context.
