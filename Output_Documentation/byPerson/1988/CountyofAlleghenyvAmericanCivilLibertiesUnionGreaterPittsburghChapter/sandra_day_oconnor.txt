counsel--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--would
you
think
that
the
context
of
the
christmas
season
would
justify
holding
a
religious
service
in
the
city-county
building?
for
example,
a
catholic
mass
or
a
similar
service,
at
christmas
time?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
the
message
conveyed
by
a
display
may
be
different
when
the
symbol
is
located
in
a
city
hall
or
a
courthouse
instead
of
a
park
in
a
commercial
district,
a
private
park?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
menorah
were
there
without
a
christmas
tree
next
to
it?
just
standing
alone.
and
it
relates
to
a
religious
holiday,
not
a
public
holiday?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mrs.
litman--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--do
you
think
that
the
city
and
county
government
can
open
up
a
courthouse
or
other
public
building
to
allow
carolers
to
come
in
and
sing
at
holiday
seasons,
and
presumably
other
groups
as
well,
at
appropriate
times?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
you
take
the--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--position
that
a
public
building
cannot
become
a
public
forum,
in
effect?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
don't
think--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
a
public
body
can
permit
groups
to
come
in
and
sing
religious
songs?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
we're
talking
about
what
the
establishment
clause
would
permit
under
your
theory.
and
the
next
case
is
down
the
road.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
we
have
to
decide
that
question
to
decide
this
case,
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
would
the
message
be
different
if
it
said
"season's
greetings"
and
had
a
few
reindeer
and
candy
canes
around,
and
other
displays,
such
as
in
lynch?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
constitution
doesn't
address--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--itself
to
what's
appropriate.
it
speaks
in
terms
of
the
establishment
clause
and
the
free
exercise
clause.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
is
the
message
of
endorsement
different
if
it's
surrounded
by
these
other
objects?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
i
asked
you--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--if
it
would
be
different
if
it
were
surrounded
by
the
other
things--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--such
as
in
lynch.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why?
because
of
its
location?
is
that
what
it
boils
down
to?
