mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
posed...
the
question
posed
in
this
case
is
whether
the
establishment
clause
limits
at
all
the
government's
display
of
religious
symbols
during
not
only
christmas
day
but
during
the
period,
in
this
case,
45
days,
including,
preceding,
and
following
christmas.
now,
the
view
taken
by
the
petitioners,
the
city
and
county,
apparently
is
that
somehow
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
congress
has
recognized
that
december
25th
is
a
federal
holiday,
and
because
presidents
have
made
proclamations,
and
the
state
has
recognized
it
as
a
state
holiday,
that
somehow
that
action
trumps
the
establishment
clause.
we
don't
think
there
is
any
necessity
for
this
court
to
take
that
view.
we
don't
think
this
court
said
that
in
lynch,
and
it
is
perfectly
appropriate
to
view
those
recognitions
of
christmas
as
a
holiday
in
terms
of
the
states
being
allowed
to
celebrate
its
secular
aspects,
but
not
in
terms
of,
as
counsel
for
the
county
has
argued,
having
a
mass
in
the
courthouse,
having
symbols
in
the
courthouse.
i
think
it's
important
for
this
court
to
understand
that
there
are
two
displays
here.
justice
stevens,
in
terms
of
your
question
about
does
the
creche
require
the
menorah,
the
court
should
understand
that
the
creche
stands
a
one.
it
is
in
the
courthouse,
and
it
is
in
the
most
prominent
and
most
public
place
in
the
courthouse.
let
me
dispel
the
impression
that
counsel
gave
when
he
suggested
that
the
record
shows
that
only...
that
90
to
95
percent
of
the
people
don't
see
it.
that
was
never
found
as
a
fact
in
this
case
nor
could
it
have
been
because
it
was
so
inherently
incredible.
that
same
witness
testified
at
page
158
of
the
record
that
that
is
the
most
beautiful
and
most
public
place
in
the
courthouse.
and,
the
third
circuit
found
specifically
that
it
was
in
a
public
place
where
people
would
see
it.
the
second
display
is
the
display
involving
the
manorah.
that
is
in
another
building
by
another
governmental
body.
the
creche
is
the
county,
the
menorah
is
by
the
city
of
pittsburgh...
and
that
menorah
is
not
on
the
steps
of,
but
on
the
face
of
the
building
itself.
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
that
is
exactly
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
now,
we
take
from
lynch
that
the
key
question
in
evaluating
governmental
displays
is
whether
the
display
amounts
to
government
endorsement
of
religion,
of
a...
of
a
particular...
or
of
a
particular
religious
message.
that
is
to
say,
does
the
display
send
a
message
to
non-adherents
that
they
are
outsiders,
not
full
members
of
the
political
community,
and
the
accompanying
message
to
adherents,
that
they
are
insiders,
favored
members
of
the
political
community?
this
court
in
lynch
held
that
a
nativity
scene
did
not
do
that.
these
displays
do,
and
they
do
so
for
reasons
that
are
constitutionally
important
and
meaningful.
and
i'd
like
to
just
briefly
identify
three
of
those.
first--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--they
are
totally
different
displays,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
we
take
the
same
position
as
to
both
of
them.
that
is,
that
both
of
them
violate
the
establishment
clause.
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
well,
justice
blackmun,
i
think
that
the
county
one
could
be
considered
to
be
an
easier
one
in
one
sense.
that
is
to
say
that
the
display
of
the
nativity
scene
here...
and
there
have
been
a
lot
of
words
said
by
counsel
and
in
the
briefs
as
to
what
that
display
conveys.
but
we
produce
that
at
pages
3
to
8
of
the
joint
exhibit
volume,
and
i
think
page
7
particularly
reflects
the
nativity
scene
as...
as
it
was
so
that
you
can
see
with
your
own
eyes
of
the
impression
conveyed
by
the
nativity
scene
and
see
whether
indeed
you
feel
that
the
message
attested
to
by
the
law
clerk
whole
judge's
chambers
were
in
that
building
who
had
to
pass
that
nativity
scene
many
times
a
day
and
had
to
make
his
way
past
it
because
it
takes
up
over
half
of
the
staircase
of
the
main
landing...
when
he
said
that
looking
at
that
scene
it
evoked
in
him
a
memory
of
when
his
people...
in
the
middle
ages
when
his
people
were
persecuted
and
forced
to
live
in
ghettos.
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
yes,
justice
blackmun,
and
i
think
that
it
is
significant
that
both
father
swiderski,
who
testified
saying
that
this
profaned
his
symbol
to
have
it
there
between
the
signs
of
the
county
commissioner
here,
the
official
signs,
the
controller
and
the
treasurer
here,
and
the
nativity
scene,
which
he
testified
was
similar
to
the
kinds
one
sees
in
a,
in
a
catholic
church.
and
ellen
doyle,
one
of
the
plaintiffs
who
is
a
religious
catholic,
said
the
scene
was
reminiscent
of
the
ones
in
a
catholic
church.
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
well,
of
course,
justice
scalia,
i
would
assume
that
perhaps
mr.
lewin
would
like
a
menorah
next
to
the
nativity
scene,
although
that...
that
wasn't
asked.
and
his
point,
yes,
is
that
next
to
the
christmas
tree--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--which
is
the
premise
of
his
argument...
he
says
that
the
christmas
tree
by
itself
sends
a
religious
message,
and,
therefore,
that
necessitates
that
the
city
have
the
menorah
as
well.
that's
for
the
second
display.
but
it's
very
important
to
recognize
that
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
not
any
displays
by
chabad,
the
intervenor,
not
by
the
people...
no
one
exercising...
free
exercise
rights.
these
displays,
each
of
them,
is
by
the
governmental
body.
they
are
gratuitous
displays
of--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--selected--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--yes.
yes.
lynch
was,
too.
but
unlike
lynch,
these
displays
are
at
government
headquarters
where
the
presence
of
government
is
pervasive
and
unmistakable.
not
only
that,
the
buildings
are
courthouses
much
like
this
one
where
certain
classes
of
citizens
are
compelled
to
come,
under
compulsion
of
law,
and
which
constitutes
buildings,
we
would
think
that,
irrespective
of
whether
they
bear
a
sign
such
as
this
one
does,
"equal
access
under
law",
that
every
citizen
should
come
to
and
does
come
to
with
the
expectation--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--that
he
or
she
will
be
treated
equally
irrespective
of
religion.
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
in--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--it...
it--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--justice
scalia,
i
think
that
the,
the
decision
in
this
case
should
hinge
on
the
confluence,
the
combination
of
all
three
factors.
and
that
is
to
say
whether
here,
in
these
buildings
where
you
have
government
engaged
in...
what
the
court
said
in
ball
was
a
symbolic
embrace
between
church
and
state
where
you
have
the
kind
of
fusion
of
church
and
state
that
this
court
has
struck
down
in
larson.
and
where
you
have
symbols
that
are
undilutedly,
intensely
religious.
that
there
is
no
question
that
these
symbols
convey
the
prohibited
message
to,
to
outsiders,
to
non-adherents,
that
they
are
outsiders
in
the
political--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--i
would
like
to,
to
address
that.
justice
marshall,
with
respect
to
the
carols,
let
me
dispel
the
notion
that's
been
created
that
somehow
these
displays
all
hinge
together
on
the
carols.
this
display,
the
creche
where
the
carols
were
sung,
stands
for
45
days.
the
carols
are
sung
for
less
than
24
hours
of
that
entire
period.
during
the
six-plus-week
period,
a
less
than
three-week
period
is
devoted
to
carols,
and
it
is
only
at
the
lunch
hour
that,
that
anyone
comes
in.
justice
marshall,
we
did
not
raise
the
carols
because
what
was...
that
was
not
a
part
of
the
original
complaint.
but
the
critical
thing
here
is
that
the
nativity
scene--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--stands--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--i
think...
i
think
they...
they
very
likely
right,
justice
marshall.
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
oh,
it
wasn't
dropped,
your
honor.
it
was
not
raised
in
this
case,
and
we
could
not
claim
here
that
it
had
a
relation
because,
indeed,
it
was
not
made
part
of
the
case.
and
the
significant
thing
here
is
that
the
nativity
scene
and
the
menorah
displays
stand
alone.
they
are
24-hour,
round-the-clock
displays.
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
in
this
case
not,
justice
scalia,
because
the...
well,
in
this
case
not
so
clear
because
the
carols
are
done
by
outside
groups.
the
nativity
scene,
however,
and
the
menorah
displays
are
for
those
respective
governments,
their
pronouncements.
it's
government
speech
that
we're
talking
about
with--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--respect
to
the
displays.
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
justice
o'connor,
with
respect
to
that...
and,
of
course,
that
is
not
the
question
before
the
court...
i
think
that
one
could
raise
a
question
as
to
the
propriety
of
singing
one
religion's
carols.
but
we
have
not
pressed
that
claim
in
this
case.
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
nor
is
it--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--this
building...
neither
the
courthouse...
certainly
the
courthouse
is
in
no
way
a
public
forum.
and
the
city-county
building...
and
we
have
to
be
careful
to
distinguish.
what
we're
talking
about
are
not
the
outside
sidewalks
or
steps.
we're
talking
about
the
face
of
the
building,
such
as
this.
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
we
don't
have
a
public--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--i
think...
i
think
a
public
body
could
permit
groups
to
come
in,
justice
o'connor,
and
we
have
not
argued
that
they
cannot.
but
in
this
case,
what
we
are
presented
with
is
whether
a
public
body
can
make
pronouncements.
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
with
respect
to
displays
where
we
are...
where
we
are
clearly,
in,
in
this...
in
this
case
and
in
cases
like
it,
in
cases
where
you
have
the
displays,
we
are
clearly
focusing
on
government's
action.
and
we
know
that
the
establishment
clause
traditionally
has
been...
has
been
held
to
be
a
limitation
on
what
government
may
pronounce.
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
i
think
not,
justice--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--i
think
not,
justice
scalia.
and
i
think
not
for
the
reason
given
by
judge
flor
in
the
united
jewish
congress
case
versus
chicago,
where
there
were
six
disclaimers.
that
if
you
put
a
frankly...
an
intensely
religious
display--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--in
a
building
that
is
so
closely
linked,
that
has
this
symbolic
link
with
government,
you
can't
dispel
the
concept
that
government
is
endorsing
it.
and
let
me
say--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--well,
i
don't...
i
don't
say
that
the
carols
are
okay
if
the
government
is
doing
that,
justice
scalia.
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
if
i
have
given
you
the
impression
that
i...
that
i
said
carols
are
okay,
i
have
misled
you.
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
with
respect
to
the
sign,
incidentally--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--yes,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
i,
i
believe
that...
it
does,
justice
kennedy.
but
in
this
case
one
of
the
critical
factors
is
that
we
don't
have
accommodation.
this
is
not
the
case--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--i,
i
think...
i
think
clearly
that
it
does.
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
well,
i
have
not
actually
thought
about
the
concept
of
having
government
purge
it,
but
i
would
think
clearly
it
appears
to
me
from
your
question
that,
yes,
there
would
be
a
point
at
which
it
would
be
violating
the
free
exercise
rights
we
all
have.
the
critical--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--i
think
not,
justice
kennedy,
because
under
the--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--mcdaniel
v.
paty--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--excuse
me?
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
i
think
not.
i
think
that
government
officials,
as
this
court
has
held
in
mcdaniel
v.
paty,
have
free
exercise
rights
as
well.
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
perhaps
it
would
show
that,
but
i
would
premise
my,
my
answer
on
the
fact
that
government
officials,
like
others,
as
this
court
has
said,
have
free
exercise
rights.
while--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--i
think,
justice
kennedy,
that
there
comes
a
point
at
which
this
court
must
say
that
the
establishment
clause
does
prohibit
government
from
making
certain
religious
pronouncements.
that
point
is
not
always
easy
to
reach.
in
this
case
it
is
because
it
is
so
far
to
whatever
the
point
should
be.
but,
obviously,
in
cases
there
are
balances
required
between
free
exercise
and
establishment.
what
makes
this
case
easy
is
there
is
no
tension
between
free
exercise
and
establishment.
in
this
case,
this
is
not
accommodation.
this
is
promotion.
this
is
not
neutrality.
this
is
favoritism.
and
to,
and
to
address
the,
the
question
of
would
the
government
have
to
put
up
a
menorah
of
a
certain
size,
or
the
question
of
justice
scalia
of
what
does
the
government
do
for
moslems,
the
answer
is
the
government
does
nothing
for
moslems.
and
even
the...
that
is,
the
county,
and
the
city
of
pittsburgh
doesn't
either.
but
the,
the
display
of
the
city
of
pittsburgh,
this
frankly
judeo/christian
symbol,
certainly
conveys--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--no,
they
did
not,
your
honor.
but,
but
that
brings
into...
into
question
the
issue
of
in
order
for
a
government
to
be
neutral,
as
this
court
has
insisted
it
must
be,
may
it
take
the
position
that
it
can
sit
back
and
wait
for,
for
religions
to
ask?
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
that
might
be
the
case,
but,
but
what
the
record
showed
in
this
case,
what
malik
tunador
testified,
was
that
in
his
religion
personification
of
the
deity...
and
he
included
jesus
christ
as
one
of
the
figures
that
one
should
not
profane...
that
personification
by
figures
is
a
profanation
of,
of
his
symbol.
but
to,
to
focus,
mr.
chief
justice,
on
how
does
a
government
treat
religions
equally
the
question
is...
and
chabad
has
suggested
that
they
sit
back
and
wait
to
be
asked...
and
perhaps
it
would
mean
that
they
don't
want
symbols.
on
the
other
hand--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--here
is
the
problem.
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
i
think
as
between
the
view
of
favoring
religion
and
non-religion,
yes,
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
but
here--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--justice
white,
that
would
be
the
case.
however,
in
this
case
you
have
the
added
problem
that
these
displays
are
frankly
denominational,
frankly
non-neutral.
they,
they,
they
have
the
preferential
kind
of
treatment
that
this--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--court
struck
down.
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
well,
that,
that,
that
might...
that
is
so.
but
the
problem
is
that
what
we
have
here
is
one
that
is
frankly
christian
and
one
that
is...
if
we
accept
mr.
lewin's
argument
that
a
christmas
tree
gives
a
christian
message.
if
we
don't
accept
that,
then
there's
no
reason,
there
is
no
basis
to
having
a
menorah--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--we
think,
justice
o'connor,
that
to...
that
to
accept
mr.
lewin's
position
this
court
is
compelled
to
decide
that.
i
think
absent
that...
and
we
don't
think
it
is
preserved
for
appeal...
but,
absent
that
as
a
basis,
they
certainly
can't
say
that
the
menorah
celebrates
christmas.
and
their...
its
whole
premise
in
being
there
is,
they
say,
to
counterbalance
what
they
say
is
the
christian
message
delivered
by
the
christmas
tree.
but
the
kind
of
preferential
treatment
you
have
here
is
the
kind
this
court
said
it
would
not
accept
and
it
struck
down
in
thornton
v.
caldor.
the,
the
kind
of
neutrality
that
we
don't
have
here
is
the
kind
of
neutrality
this
court
insisted
on
in
larson.
and
there
is
this
problem,
mr.
chief
justice.
as
you
indicated
in
your
dissent
in
larson
in
dealing
with
the
unification
church,
what
if
the
city
gets
a
request,
if
somebody
gives
them
a
picture
of
the
reverend
moon.
now,
do
they
have
to
put
that
up
or
will
the
government
then
be
involved
in
deciding
is
the
unification
church
a
religion?
and
what
do
they
do
with
scientology
or,
or,
or
with
groups
that
have
no
symbols.
or,
of
course,
with--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--well,
of
course--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--justice
scalia,
of
course,
the
petitioners
here
urge
that
what
justifies
the...
ignoring
the
prohibitions
of
the
establishment
clause
at
this
time
is
that
petitioners
say
that
lynch
said
that
during
this
amorphously
defined
christmas
season,
however
long
that
is,
one
can
put
up--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--well,
45
days
here.
but
if
during
this
45
days
one
can
put
up
symbols
related
to
christmas
and
then
they
get...
under
that
umbrella
they
put
in
the
menorah
because
it
happens
that
the...
that
the
jewish
religion
has
chanukah
at
that
time...
let
me
point
out,
however...
and
i
think
it's
of
critical
importance
in
deciding
the
case...
that
this
court
understand
that
the
impact
of
these
symbol
on
religious
minorities
in
this
country
is
very,
very
strong.
the
feeling...
aside
from
chabad,
the
court
will
note
that
not
only
the
jewish
law
clerk
and
the
jewish
lawyers
in
this
case
urged
that
these
symbols
not
be
permitted,
but
with
unanimity,
the,
the,
the
majority
of
the
jewish
population
in
this
country
have
filed
briefs
here
urging
this
court--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--not
to--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--it
was
true
in
lynch.
but
the
significant
thing
here,
your
honor,
is
that,
i
hope
it
will
underscore
for
the
court,
that
they
would
rather
not
have...
and
they
asked
this
court
not
to
permit
government
to
endorse
their
symbol,
the
menorah,
rather
than
have
to
suffer
it
at
the
cost
of
having
the--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--christian
symbol,
the
creche--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--well,
i
think
not.
well,
it,
it,
it
may
be.
and
this
one
sector
of
the
jewish
faith
doesn't...
although...
although
until
today
they
have
never
taken
a
view
with
respect
to
the
creche.
their
intervention
here
has
been
limited
to
the,
the
menorah.
but
the
great
majority...
and
you
have
briefs
as
amici
here
from
all
over
this,
this
country,
the
jewish
populations
urging
this
court
not
to
permit
either
of
these
displays.
and
knowing,
with
the
history
that
they...
that
they
have
had,
with
the
many
years
of
living
under
governments
that
used
religious
displays
not
to
foster
tolerance
and
love
among
religions
but
to
foster
intolerance
and
hatred
and
bigotry,
and
knowing
that
when,
when
their
own
religious--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--excuse--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--i
think
that...
i
think
that--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--you
say...
that
is
perfectly
fine,
justice
scalia.
we
would
not
object
to
december
25th.
we
think
it
is
a,
a,
a
valid
holiday
similar
to
this
court's
decision
in
mcgowan
where
they
said
that
sunday
had
secular
reasons.
but
we
don't
go
on
from
there
and
embrace
the
county's
notion
that
somehow
that
validates
or
wipes
cut
the
establishment
clause
for
45
days.
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
if
congress
did
that,
i
think
an
argument
could
be
made,
justice
rehnquist,
that
perhaps
it
was
accommodating
or
recognizing
that
many
people
take
off
on
that
day
anyway.
i
don't
think
that
that
hypothet
is
as
clear
as
the...
as
the
case
of
christmas,
which
is
celebrated
clearly
by
the
majority.
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
yes,
of
course,
that's
the
issue,
justice
kennedy.
and
the
reason
that
it
is
an
endorsement
here
is
because
where
it
is.
each
of
these
governments
has
reached
out
to
link
arms
with
a
religion.
they
have
accepted,
they
have
embraced,
frankly
evangelical
symbols.
with
respect
to
the
nativity
scene,
this
one
doesn't
say,
like
the
one
in
lynch,
"season's
greetings"
or
"happy
holidays"
or
even
"merry
christmas".
this
one
says,
"glory
in
excelsis
deo",
a
quotation
from
the
gospel
of--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--justice
o'connor,
that
is
certainly
something
that
the
court
would,
would
have
to
consider,
although
we
would
suggest
that
that
kind
of
scene
would
not
be
appropriate
in
a
courthouse
in
any
event.
the,
the
easy
part
about
this
case
is
that
there--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--are
those
symbols.
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
hear
the
first
word
you--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--i
think
that
the
message
of
endorsement
in
this
case,
justice
o'connor,
comes
about
from
all
three
factors.
where
the,
the,
the
symbol
is,
its,
its
identity,
the,
the
imprimatur
of
the--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--state
is
unconscionable.
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
i
think--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--i
think...
i
think
that
it
would
not
be
permissible,
but
i
think
it
would
be
a
different
display.
it
would
not
have
the--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--no.
no.
i
think
not,
justice
o'connor.
but
i
think
when
you
have
the
candy
canes
and
the
santa
claus,
one
might
more
easily
be
able
to
say
they're
not
getting
a
religious
message.
where
you
have
a
nativity
scene,
as
this
one,
or
a,
a
menorah,
where
none
of
those
are
there,
then
the,
the
religious
message
is
undispelled--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--well--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--it's
one
of--
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
--well,
i
think
in
this
case,
justice
scalia,
it's
clearly
part
of
the
frame
around
the,
the
nativity
scene.
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
it,
you'd
have
to
agree
that
it
enhances
and,
and
makes
more
prominent
the
nativity
scene.
mr.
roslyn
m.
litman
we
think
what
you're
endorsing
in
that
case,
justice
scalia
is
judeo/christian
symbols
that
totally
ignore
in
an
appalling
lack
of
appreciation
for
the
moslems,
the
hindus,
the
buddhists
in
the
population
of
pittsburgh,
the
ever-increasing
number
of
asian-americans
whom
we
are
in
the
process
of
welcoming
to
our
country
who
don't
adhere
to
the
judeo/christian
symbols,
but
who
are
nevertheless
part
of
what,
what
is,
we
believe,
embraced
and
protected
by
the
prohibitions
of
the
establishment
clause.
and,
and
we
think
that
by...
by
adhering
to
the
concept
that
government
must
remain
neutral...
we
have
managed...
this
country
has
managed
over
the
last
200
years
to
preserve
a
very
important
right
that
the
framers
set
for
us
when
they...
when
they
wrote
the
first
amendment.
and
to
say,
as
counsel
does,
that
we
can
now
kick
over
all
of
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court
on
the
establishment
clause,
that
suddenly
we
put
in
a
new
provision
talking
about
coercion...
and
he,
he
neglects
to
mention
to
the
court
that
the
same
kind
of
indirect
coercion
is
present
here,
as
the
court
found
in
engel...
but
this
court
has
never
required
coercion.
their
interpretation
means
that
this
court
would
say
that
the
framers,
in
enacting
the
establishment
clause,
enacted
a
total
redundancy
because,
of
course,
it
would
have
no
meaning.
