mr.
peter
buscemi
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
five
years
ago
this
court
decided
a
case
called
lynch
against
donnelly.
in
that
case
the
court
upheld
a
christmas
display
in
pawtucket,
rhode
island
against
a
first
amendment
challenge.
the
display
contained
a
rather
large
nativity
scene
with
figures
as
big
as
five-feet
tall.
the
city
of
pawtucket
owned
the
display,
erected
it,
and
maintained
it
each
year
as
part
of
a
display
in
the
vicinity
of
the
city
hall
and
a
private
park
near
the
downtown
shopping
center.
mr.
peter
buscemi
yes,
your
honor.
the
mayor
himself
participated
in
the
lighting
of
the
display
each
year,
and
a
ceremony
to
which
people
were
invited...
the
public
was
invited.
and
the
city's
involvement
in
the
display
was
never
challenged.
indeed,
that
was
the
reason
that
the
case
came
before
this
court
in
the
first
place.
had
there
been
no
city
involvement,
of
course,
there
would
have
been
no
constitutional
issue
presented
in
lynch
at
all.
the
court
rejected
the
establishment
clause
challenge
in
lynch
and
held
that
the
display
did
not
compel
or
seek
to
compel
adherence
to
any
religious
belief
and
did
not
violate
the
establishment
clause.
the
way
in
which
the
court
put
the
issue
to
be
decided
in
lynch
is
significant
for
today's
case.
the
court
said
that
the
issue
for
decision
in
lynch
was
whether
the
establishment
clause
prohibits
a
municipality
from
including
a
creche
or
nativity
scene
in
its
annual
christmas
display.
that
is
how
the
court
began
its
opinion.
in
the
five
years
since
lynch
was
decided,
three
federal
courts
of
appeals
have
considered
establishment
clause
challenges
to
christmas
displays
in
various
cities
around
the
country,
including
pittsburgh,
chicago,
and
birmingham,
michigan.
mr.
peter
buscemi
yes,
your
honor.
that
was
affirmed
by
an
equally
divided
court.
and,
in
any
event,
the
scarsdale
case
was
slightly
different,
as
you
may
remember,
because
it
involved
a
request
by
a
group
to
put
a
display
in
a
park.
it
was
not
a
city
display
that
was
challenged
after
it
was
erected,
as
was
the
case
in
the
chicago
case,
the
birmingham
case,
and
the
case
that's
here
today,
the
pittsburgh
case.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
third
circuit
and
it
involves
displays
in
the
allegheny
county
courthouse
and
in
the
city-county
building
which
is
directly
across
the
street
from
the
allegheny
county
courthouse
in
downtown
pittsburgh.
the
allegheny
county
courthouse
display
consists
of
a
nativity
scene
which
is
surrounded
by
christmas
trees,
poinsettia
plants,
wreaths
on
the
windows
behind
the
staircase,
and
is
used
as
the
site
for
a
choral
program
that
takes
place
throughout
the
christmas
season
each
year.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
the
creche
in
the
pawtucket
case
was
surrounded
by
a
variety
of
things,
including
a
jumbo
candy-cane,
a
talking
wishing
well,
some
reindeer,
a
santa
claus,
a
sleigh
and
a
variety
of
christmas
symbols.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
that's
a
matter
of
dispute
in
the
case,
your
honor.
as
i
read
the
court's
opinion,
the
court
did
not
very
heavily
stress
the
additional
items
that
were
included
in
a
display.
the
opinion
for
the
court--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--all
right.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the...
the
staircase
on
which
the
nativity
scene
was
displayed
in
this
case
was
decorated
with
christmas
trees,
poinsettia
plants
and
wreaths.
there
were
other
decorations
elsewhere
in
the
building,
not
immediately
on
the
staircase.
the
staircase
was
also
used
as
the
site
for
the
choir
programs
that
took
place
every
day
during
the
christmas
season
during
the
noon
hour.
in
addition,
the
bottom
of
the
staircase,
which
is
on
the
second
floor
of
the
county
courthouse,
opens
into
an
area
called
the
gallery/forum
area
which
the
court
can
see
in
the
pictures
that
are
reproduced
in
the
joint
exhibit
volume.
that
gallery/forum
area
is
an
area
that's
used
to
display
a
variety
of
artwork
throughout
the
year.
it's
not
any
kind
of
an
integral
part
of
the
christmas
display.
in
any
event,
as
far
as
we
are
concerned,
the
opinion
in
lynch
does
not
stress
the
additional
secular
elements
in
the
christmas
display.
they
are
listed
at
the
beginning
of
the
court's
opinion,
but
very
little,
if
any,
of
the
court's
opinion
puts
any
emphasis
on
them
as
a
key
factor
in
the
court's
decision.
what
is
a
key
factor
in
the
court's
decision
and
what
applies
equally
here
is
the
context
of
the
holiday
season.
the
nativity
scene
here,
just
like
the
nativity
scene
in
lynch,
was
not
erected
in
the
abstract.
it
was
erected
as
part
of
a
holiday
celebration
that
was
sponsored
by
the
county
of
allegheny
and
then
the
separate
display
on
the
city-county
building--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--sponsored
by
the
city.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
your
honor,
that
question
was
raised
during
the
oral
argument
in
lynch,
and
i
think
i'll
answer
it
the
same
way
as
the
solicitor
general
answered
it
on
that
occasion.
i
think
that
probably
tests
the
limit
of
the
court's
decision
in
lynch,
but
i
would
say
that
would
be
appropriate
as
long
as
it
were
a
noncoercive
ceremony.
that
is,
it
did
not
involve
any
compulsion
and
it
did
not
involve
anything
more
than
a
de
minimus
expenditure
of
public
funds.
we
think...
our
first
submission
to
the
court
about
the
legality
of
both
the
nativity
scene
and
the
other
display
is
that
they
are
passive
displays.
the
court
mentioned
in
lynch
twice
that
they
were...
that
the
display
in
that
case
was
a
passive
symbol
of
the
holiday.
and
we
think
that
that
in
and
of
itself
is
ground
for
sustaining
the
displays
in
this
case.
i
might
add,
just
so
that
the
facts
are
clear,
the
second
display
is
in
the
front
of
the
city-county
building.
it
consists
of
a
45
foot
christmas
tree.
there
is
an
18
foot
menorah
attached
to
the
pillar
next
to
the
christmas
tree.
and
there
are...
there
is
a
sign
from
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
pittsburgh,
the
text
of
which
is
reprinted
in
the
briefs...
talks
about
a
salute
to
liberty
and
a
reminder
that
the
festive
lights...
that
the
festive
lights
remind
us
that
we
are
the
keepers
of
the
flame
of
liberty
and
our
legacy
of
freedom.
mr.
peter
buscemi
your
honor,
we
don't
think
so.
at
least,
not
in
this
case.
and
the
reason
is
that
the
city's
involvement
with
the
display
in
lynch
was
absolutely
clear
as
well.
that
was
how
the
case
came
to
this
court.
moreover,
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
court's
opinion
in
lynch,
the
court
noted
that
the
kind
of
display
that
the
court
was
addressing
in
lynch
was
of
the
kind
that
was
frequently
displayed
on
public
grounds
throughout
the
united
states.
and,
in
fact,
i
think
there's
a
very
strong
argument
that
the
display
on
the
steps
of
the
second
floor
of
the
county
courthouse,
a
display
which
the
record
shows
was
not
even
seen
by
90
to
95
percent
of
the
people
who
enter
the
courthouse,
is
far
less
prominent
and
far
less
likely
to
convey
any
message
of
government
approval
than
is
the
display
in
pawtucket,
which
was
erected
and
maintained
by
the
city
and
which
was
illuminated
by
the
city
in
a
ceremony
to
which
the
public
was
invited.
mr.
peter
buscemi
yes.
i
think
the
symbol
itself
is
a
passive
device.
now,
there
are
cases
that
you
may
be
aware
of
from
the
lower
federal
courts
involving
enormous
crosses
that
were
illuminated
either
on
a
hillside
or
the
side
of
a
very
prominent
building
and
that
were
found
to
be
violations
of
the
establishment
clause
because
of
the
dominance
of
the
symbol
over
the
community
and
the
inability
to
avoid
the
symbol
and
the
fact
that
it
looked
as
if
the
city
were
endorsing
this
as
a
symbol
for
the
entire
community.
that
is
far
from
the
case
here.
as
far
as
the
passive-active
dichotomy,
i
think
my
answer
to
your
question
is
yes,
they
would
be
passive
symbols.
we
have
outlined
in
our
briefs
that
the
evil
that
was
addressed
by
the
establishment
clause
initially
was
the
evil
of
government
coercion.
either
government
coercion
of
adherence
to
particular
religious
beliefs
or
government
use
of
public
funds
to
establish
and
support
a
church.
in
the
absence
of
those...
of
either
of
those
things,
we...
i
think
we
have
to
recognize
that
we're
on
the
periphery
of
what
the
framers
sought
to
address
in
the
establishment
clause
in
the
first
place.
now,
justice
o'connor's
concurring
opinion
in
lynch
suggested
a
somewhat
broader
focus
on
the
concept
of
endorsement.
and,
of
course,
endorsement
or
the
persuasive
value
of
government
action,
doesn't
necessarily
involve
coercion.
if
the
mayor,
for
example,
were
to
announce
that
he
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea
if
the
city
adopted
judaism
as
its
official
religion,
that
might
not
involve
any
coercion
but
it
might
nevertheless
constitute
the
kind
of
endorsement
that
justice
o'connor's
concurring
opinion
suggested
would
be
inappropriate.
mr.
peter
buscemi
buscemi.
mr.
peter
buscemi
i'm
not
aware
that--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--i'm
not
aware
that
the
city
does
put
up
a
similar
display
for
any
holiday.
one
of
the
named
respondents
in
this
case
is
a
moslem,
mr.
tunador.
he
testified
at
the
hearing
in
this
case
that
the
moslem
faith
does
not
use
outward
symbols,
and,
indeed,
regards
them
as
improper.
mr.
peter
buscemi
so,
just
to
answer
your
specific
question--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--the
key
point
in
the
lynch
case
and
the
key
point
in
my
answer
to
your
question
would
be
the
christmas
holiday
season
itself.
that
is,
the
distinction
that
i
would
make
between
this
case
and
the
case
that
you
pose
is
that
christmas
has
already
been
recognized
as
a
national
and
a
state
holiday.
christmas...
and
that
is,
in
fact,
the
central
thrust
of
the
court's
opinion
in
lynch.
christmas,
with
its
name,
derived
from
christ,
and
christ's
mass,
has
been
recognized
as
a
holiday,
it's
celebrated,
the
public
employees
are
paid
for
not...
even
though
they
don't
work
on
that
day.
and
the
recognition
of
the
historical
origins
of
the
holiday
was
seen
by
the
court
in
lynch
as
having,
at
least
in
part,
a
secular
purpose.
mr.
peter
buscemi
the
menorah,
i
think,
your
honor,
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
holiday
season,
as
it
is
celebrated
by
the
residents
of
pittsburgh.
and
that,
indeed,
is
what
was
said
by
the
district
court
in
this
case,
and
it
was
also
what
was
testified
to
by
the
witnesses
called
by
the
petitioners
in
the
case.
the
chanukah
holiday
occurs
on
calendar
at
approximately
the
time
of
christmas.
the
menorah
was
designed
to...
for
the
purposes
set
forth
in
the
mayor's
message,
to
remind
the
people
in
pittsburgh
of
the
light
of
liberty
and
our
legacy
of
freedom,
and
there
was
a
secular
component
to
that
symbol.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
in
fact,
in
this
particular
case
we
had
a
menorah
next
to
a
christmas
tree
without
a
nativity
scene,
and
then
a
nativity
scene
on
the
staircase
indoors
without
a
menorah
at
all.
so,
i
would
not
draw
any
conclusions
based
necessarily
on
the
size
of
the
figures.
in
fact--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--as
i
said--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--well,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
that
would
also
be
permissible.
i
don't
think
that
the
christmas
tree
is
necessary
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
display.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
court's
decision
in
lynch
suggests
that,
that
it
would
be.
it's
really
the
same
point
that
was
made
by
judge
wels
in
his
dissent
in
this
case
in
response
to
the
majority's
attempted
distinction
of
lynch
on
the
two
bases
that,
one,
there
was
an
unadorned
nativity
scene,
which
was
factually
incorrect.
but
even
if
it
had
been
factually
correct,
i
don't
think
that
lynch's
emphasis
on
the
holiday
season
would
be
negated
even
if
it
were
unadorned.
and,
secondly,
it's
the
city
hall
location,
which
judge
wels
also
addressed
in
his
dissent.
so,
i
don't
think
anything
would
change.
but
i
think
that
the
presence
of
the
christmas
tree
emphasizes
the
overall
holiday
setting
which
the
court
found
so
important
in
lynch.
mr.
peter
buscemi
no,
sir.
there
was
no
challenge
to
the
christmas
tree,
no
challenge
to
the
choral
program
of
christmas
carols,
no
challenge
to
any
of
the
other
decorations
in
the
county
courthouse.
and
that
was
made
explicit
on
several
occasions
during
the
hearing.
if
the
court
please,
i
would
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
peter
buscemi
your
honor,
thank
you.
the
position
of
the
respondents
is
basically
inconsistent
with
what
this
court
decided
in
lynch.
virtually
all
of
the
arguments
that
the
court
has
just
heard
would
have
been
equally
applicable
to
the
situation
in
lynch,
a
situation
in
which
the
court
ruled
that
the
christmas
display
of
the
city
was
permissible.
as
the
court
said
in
that
decision,
the
display
was
no
more
an
advancement
or
endorsement
of
religion
than
the
christmas
holiday
itself.
mr.
peter
buscemi
your
honor,
i
don't
know
precisely
how
long
the
display
in
the
pawtucket
case
was
in
the
park,
but
i
suspect
that
it
was
there
throughout
the
christmas
shopping
season,
because
it
was
right
near
the
downtown
shopping
district.
and
the
display
there,
of
course,
took
up
far
more
space
than
the
display
here,
in
a
far
more
public
place,
a
place
seen
by
far
many...
far
more
people
than
in
this
case.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
yes,
there
was,
your
honor.
but
the
nativity
scene
itself
was
far
bigger
than
the
one
here.
the
simple
point
is
that
as
this
court
said
at
the
very
beginning
of
its
decision
in
lynch,
there
is
an
affirmative...
the
constitution
does
not
require
a
complete
separation
of
church
and
state,
it
affirmatively
mandates
accommodation,
not
merely
tolerance,
and
forbids
hostility
toward
any.
anything
less
would
require
the
callous
indifference
that
this
court
has
said
it
was
never
intended
by
the
establishment
clause.
and
the
purging
of
religious
symbols,
the
total
elimination
of
all
recognition
of
religion
in
our
society
from
public
buildings
or
other
public
grounds
is
something
that
the
constitution
has
never
required
and
that
this
court
has
never
required.
as
judge
weis
said
at
the
conclusion
of
his
dissent,
"lynch
advocated
an
approach
of
moderation,
understanding,
and
a
sense
of
proportion
in
ruling
on
displays
commemorating
the
christmas
season.
"
"the
establishment
clause...
such
displays
constitute
simply
a
tolerable
acknowledgement
of
beliefs
widely
held
among
people
of
this
country.
"
"they
pose
no
threat
to
religious
freedom,
but
their
suppression
forebodes
ominous
consequences.
"
your
honor,
the
petitioners
in
this
case
support
those
views
and
believe
that
the
displays
in
this
case
should
be
sustained
for
essentially
the
same
reasons
that
the
displays
in
lynch
were--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--well--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--that's
exactly
right.
and
i
think,
in
fact,
one
of
the
characters--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--it's
precisely
what
the
court
said--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--in
lynch.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
the
question
of
whether
the
display
in
lynch
was
a
commercial
display
i
think
would
raise
a
