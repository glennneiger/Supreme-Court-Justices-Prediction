we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
87-2050,
county
of
allegheny
v.
american
civil
liberties
union
and
related
cases.
mr.
buscemi,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
any
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
challenge
the
christmas
tree
by
itself?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
buscemi.
mr.
lewin.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lewin.
mrs.
litman,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it
is
with
the
christmas
tree?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
moslems
request
that
something
be
done
for
them?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
one
thing...
one
way
it
could
justify
doing
that
is,
we
were
told
by
opposing
counsel
that
the
moslems
simply
do
not
want
something
like
that.
so
that
perhaps
if
they
don't
ask
it
means
they
are
not
in
the
least
bit
desirous
of
having
a
public
display.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
wasn't
that
true--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--wasn't
that
true
curing
lynch,
too?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--apparently
a
disagreement
among
different
sectors
of
the
jewish
faith.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
that
because--
--what
if
congress
next
year
declared
good
friday
to
be
a
holiday
in
the
christian...
the
friday
before
easter?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mrs.
litman.
mr.
buscemi,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
buscemi.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
