am
i
saying
your
name
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
buscemi.
what
does
the
city
do
for
moslems?
i
don't
know
what
an
equivalently
important
celebration
for
moslems
would
be.
ramadan,
i
don't
think
they
celebrated
ramadan.
it's
a
penitential
season.
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--pick
a
moslem
holiday.
what
if
it
were
shown
that
the
city
here
did
not
put
up
a
similar
display
for
the
moslem
holiday?
justice
antonin
scalia
uh-huh.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
pick
another
faith.
or
make
up
one.
you,
you
see
my
point.
in,
in
order
to
avoid
endorsing
or
appearing
to
favor
one
sect
of
religion
over
another,
which
i
think
the
constitution
does
not
permit,
does
the
city
have
to
do
this
for
every
group?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
explains
the
creche
but
not
the
menorah.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
the
creche
and
menorah
have
to
be
about
the
same
size?
what
if
you
have
an
enormous
creche
and
a
little
tiny
menorah,
or
an
enormous
menorah
and
a
little
tiny
creche?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
about
a
menorah
for
a
very
small
group?
is...
i
mean,
they'd
all
be
the
same
size
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
lewin's
point
is
that
precisely
to
eliminate
any
such
misperception
on
the
part
of
this
young
man,
it
would
be
good
to
have
a
menorah
there
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
uh-huh.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
in
lynch--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
was
in
lynch
too,
of
course.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
where--
justice
antonin
scalia
--where
was
it
in
lynch?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
had
the
impression
it
was
in
a
place
that
it
would
be
even
more
difficult
to
avoid.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
was
clear
that
that
was
a
governmental
display,
wasn't
it?
you
really
want
us
to
make
a
distinction
on
the
basis
of
whether,
whether
it's
in
a...
on
government
property
even
though
the
display
is
obviously
a
government
display,
is
obviously
in
a
place
where
a
lot
of
people
nave
to
see
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
going
to
be
the
line?
one
line
is
this
was
on
government-owned
property
as
opposed
to
simply
being
obviously
done
by
government
in
a
place
where
all
citizens
have
to
see
it.
now,
the
second
line
is
24
hours
versus
40
days.
isn't
it
clear
that
if
this
is
bad,
that
carols
are
bad,
too?
i
mean,
assuming
that
it's...
that
they're
not
santa
claus
carols.
i
mean,
you're
talking
silent
night
and
religious
carols.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
if
there
was
a
sign
on
this
creche
that
said,
"this
creche
was
hand-painted
and
donated
and
has
been
put
here
by
the
knights
of
columbus.
"
or
the
first
presbyterian
church,
that
would
be
okay,
then?
it
would
be
like
the
carols.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wouldn't
be
the
government
doing
it.
it
would
be
the
first
presbyterian
church
doing
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
uh-huh.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
very
rational
position
until
you
say
that
carols
are
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
the
government
isn't
singing
the
carols.
it's
letting
groups
come
in
to
sing
the
carols.
just
as
it's
letting
groups
come
in
to
put
up
the
creche.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
it
would...
it
would
have
to
be
a
group
that
has
a
symbol
that
is
related
to
the
celebration
of
the
particular
season
that
we
said
in
lynch
allowed
the
government
to
enter
into
this
field
in
a,
in
a
special
area
where
it
can't
normally
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
distinctive
about
the
menorah
is
the
jews
celebrate
the
same
season
in
a
different
aspect.
and
if
there
was
another
group
that
celebrated
the
same
season,
presumably...
it
for
some
reason
reverend
moon
was
celebrated
at
christmas
time,
which
would
seem
unusual
to
me,
i
suppose
you'd
have
to
put
his
picture
up.
justice
antonin
scalia
mrs.
litman,
what
do
you
do
about
christmas?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
do
about
the
federal
government
declaring
christmas
to
be
a
holiday?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
poinsettias
and
wreaths?
i
don't
think
there
were
any
poinsettias
in
bethlehem.
why
isn't
that
like
a
candy
cane?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
a
christmas
tree?
or...
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
--or
wreaths?
i
don't
know
that
that's...
is
that
part
of
a
secular
or
part
of
the
religious?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
your
endorsement
point,
at
least
with
respect
to
the
christmas
tree
and
the
menorah.
how
could
you
possibly
be
endorsing
either
christianity
or
judaism
when
you
have
symbols
of
either?
now,
i
can
understand
how
you
might
say
you
are
endorsing
religiousness
by
acknowledging
the
religiousness
of
the
people,
and
this
is
a
significant
religious
holiday
for,
for
both
of
these
groups.
but
as
for
endorsing
one
sector
rather
than
another,
how
could
you
possibly
be?
