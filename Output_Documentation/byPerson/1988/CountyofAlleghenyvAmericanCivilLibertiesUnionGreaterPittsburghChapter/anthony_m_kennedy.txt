are
all
symbols
passive?
would
a
cross
be
passive?
or
a
swastika,
which
brings
forth
powerful
emotions?

mrs.
litman--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--does
the
government
have
a
duty
to
accommodate
religion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i,
i,
i
understand.
but
at
same
point...
and
that
certainly
precludes
the
appearance
of
hostility
to
religion,
does
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
say
that
at
some
point
a...
an
attempt
by
the
government
to
purge
religious
symbols
from
our
life
can
constitute
hostility
to
religion?
at
some
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
if...
suppose
that
the
government
officials
at
the
inauguration
left
during
the
invocation
that
preceded
the
presidential
inaugural.
there
was
an
invocation
before
and
an
invocation
after.
should
government
officials
have
left?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
perhaps--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--sat
down
while
everybody
else
was
standing
up?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
perhaps
sat
down
while
everybody
else
was
standing
up?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
isn't
the
reason
for
that
that
if
you
insisted
on
that
action,
it
would
show
hostility
to
religion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
ban
christmas
carols
in
all
public
buildings,
could
that
be
interpreted
reasonably
by
some
people
as
hostility
to
religion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
would
still
be
here
even
if
the
moslems
requested
and
they
were
on
the
front
steps
and
everybody
else
was
that
wanted
on.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
isn't
the
reason
for
that...
it's
because
everyone
knows
that
it's
not
an
endorsement?
in
your
earlier
answer
to
the
chief
justice
you
said
that
other
groups
object
to
this
endorsement
of
religion.
but
that's
the
issue,
isn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
must
say,
counsel,
that
45
days
of
a
display
in
a
courthouse
is
a
very
substantial
commitment
of
a
neutral
form
to
an
image
that
is
certainly
conceded
by
all
to
be
religious.
