mr.
lewin--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
lewin,
do
you
think
the
city
had
a
duty
to
put
up
the
menorah
if
there
had
been
a
request
for
or
having
already
decided
to
display
the
creche?
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
constitutional
duty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--next
question
i
was
going
to
ask.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
then
you
have
two
religions
represented,
would
you
have
a
constitutional
obligation
to
satisfy
the
request
of
a
third
or
fourth
and
a
fifth
that
might
have
different...
pagan
symbols
or
whatever
they
might
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
how
large--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--how
large--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--how
large
must
the
religious
group
be
to
be
entitled
to
that
kind
of
representation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
three
or
four
persons
who
sincerely
believed
in
the
particular
faith
would
be
sufficient.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
this
a
majority
rule
kind
of
thing--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
mean,
there
can
be
a
very
large
religion
from,
you
know,
another
country
where
they
have
only
three
or
four
representatives
in
pittsburgh,
but
they
may
feel
just
as
deeply
about
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
has
it
not
adopted
a
public
forum?
isn't
that
what
it's
done?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not
correct
that
the
whole
premise
of
your
argument
is
that
the
creche
itself
conveys
a
religious
message?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
buscemi,
can
i
interrupt?
you're
really...
your
position
then
is
that
basically
there
is
a
judgment
to
be
made
that
the
extremes
on
either
side
are
really
not...
not
realistic
alternatives,
that
we
have
to
make
a
judgment
as
to
whether
the
particular
display
in
its
particular
setting
is
too
much
of
an
endorsement
of
religion.
is
that
right?
that's
what
those
words...
the
message
those
words
gave
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
obviously,
you're
not
going
to
say
you've
got
to
take
"in
god
we
trust"
off
the
coins
and
everything
like
that.
nobody
would
go
that
far.
so,
somewhere
along
the
line
somebody
has
to
make
a
judgment
in
these
difficult
cases.
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
there
is
some...
what
seems
to
be
an
arbitrary
line
is
because
somewhere
you've
got
to
draw
a
line.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
would
not
be
ridiculous
to
say--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
line
is
the
difference
between
a
commercial
display
such
as
you
had
in
lynch,
and
a
noncommercial
display
such
as
you
have
here.
that's
not
a
frivolous
line,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
there's
all
sorts
of
secular
aspects
of
that
display
that
are
not
repeated
in
this
display.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
location
was
dramatically
different,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what's
so
wrong...
why
is
that
any
more
arbitrary
than
any
other
line
that
you're
going
to
have
to
draw
in
this
area?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
put
a
ridiculous
name
on
it,
but
nevertheless
there
is
a
difference,
isn't
there?
well,
it
may
not
be
more
arbitrary,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
does
depart
from
the
line
that
this
court
drew
in
lynch,
which
was
that
the
critical
consideration
was
the
context
of
the
holiday
setting,
rather
than
the
accompaniment
of
the
nativity
scene
by
other
secular
symbols.
because,
of
course,
then
the
next
question
will
be
are
two
reindeer
enough
or
do
you
need
eight?
or,
going
in
the
other
direction.
is
it
all
right
to
say
mass
in
the
courtroom?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
can
go
in
either
direction
on
these
things.
