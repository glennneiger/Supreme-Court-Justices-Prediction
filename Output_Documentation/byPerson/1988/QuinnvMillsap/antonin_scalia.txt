justice
antonin
scalia
--what
if
the
legislature,
the
state
legislature...
or,
for
that
matter,
the
governor,
had
authority
to
propose
the
plan.
and
let's
say
the
legislature
were,
you
know,
70
percent
democratic--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
it
proposes
the
plan
and
the
people
either
take
it
or
leave
it.
now,
could
a
voter
come
in
and
say,
well,
you
know,
i'm
a
republican,
it's
a
democratic-dominated
legislature,
i
haven't
had
a
good
shot
at
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
two
challenges
here,
mr.
o'keefe.
one
facial
and
one
as
applied.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
why
is
it
bad
for
the
appointing
officials
to
make
as
one
of
the
qualifications
that
they
want
for
their
appointees
that
the
appointee
own
real
property?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
gets
you
back
to
your
facial
challenge
then.
i
mean,
if
you're
saying
it's
a
requirement
of
the
law
or
it's
not
a
requirement
of
the
law
but
it's
how
the
law
has
been
applied
in
this
case...
you're
saying
you
have
nothing
but
a
facial
challenge.
even
your
"as
applied"
challenge
hinges
on
the
fact
that
the
law
requires
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
saying
it
just
boils
down
to
your
facial
challenge,
because
the
law
requires
it.
and
if
the
law
doesn't
require
it,
it's
okay
that
each
of
the
appointing
officials
should
voluntarily...
or,
perhaps,
even
on
the
basis
of
bad
advice
from
his
counsel,
have
selected
a
freeholder.
is
there
anything
wrong
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
--your
facial
challenge.
when
you
say
they
cannot,
that...
that
requires
that
we
find
that
that's
what
the
constitution
of
missouri
requires.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
your
"as
applied"
challenge,
i
thought,
did
not
hinge
on
our
determining
what
the
constitution
of
missouri
requires.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
no
good?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i...
you...
what
if
the
governor
and
all
the
other
appointing
officials
happen
to
be
republicans
and
they
say,
as
frequently
happens
in
this
town
when
appointment
are
made,
"i'm
going
to
appoint
republicans".
is
that
all
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
a
whole
board
of
freeholders
with
nothing
but
republicans
on
it.
is
there
anything
wrong
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
--this
is
a
hypothetical,
mr.
o'keefe.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
not
be
outside
the
scope?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
policy-making
body?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
saying
with
others.
that
was
criterion
one,
and
then
we'll
look
at
other
ones.
but,
number
one,
you
have
to
be
a
republican.
and,
don't
bother
me,
i'll
look
at
your
other
qualifications
when...
that's
done
sometimes,
you
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
o'keefe,
your
opponent
refers
to
the
board
of
freeholders
in
the
new
jersey
counties,
which
he
says
there
is
no
evidence
that
any
of
the
persons
elected
to
those
posts
have
to
be
freeholders.
and
i
assume
you
could
call
something
a
board
of
freeholders
without
requiring
that
they
own
land,
if
you
want
to.
do
we
have
a
clear
holding
here
by
missouri
courts
that
because
the
name
of
this
is
board
of
freeholders
you
cannot
be
elected
to
it
unless
you...
unless
you
are
a
freeholder?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
can
see
that
freeholders
means
what
everybody
thinks
freeholders
means.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there's...
there's
no
provision
in
the
missouri
constitution
that
says
the
members
of
the
board
of
freeholders
shall
be
freeholders.
it
just
calls
them
the
board
of
freeholders.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
couldn't
it
be
possible
for
the
missouri
supreme
court
to
say,
yeah,
they're
called
that,
and
maybe
once
upon
a
time
they
were
that,
but
there's
no
constitutional
requirement
that
they
all
own
real
property.
couldn't
it...
wouldn't
that
be
within
the
realm
of
the
of
the
power
of
the
missouri
supreme
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
this
instance
there
isn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
see,
i'm...
i'm
a
little
reluctant
to
set
aside
a...
a...
a
proposal
in
missouri
on
the
basis
of
a
meaning
of
the
missouri
constitution
unless
it's
unavoidable
that
the
constitution
requires
an
interpretation
that
makes
this
thing
invalid.
and...
do
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
they
didn't
say
no,
but
they
didn't
say
yes,
either.
there...
it's
hard
to
point
to
a
line
in
their
opinion
where
they
say,
of
course,
the
meaning
of
our
state
constitution
is
that
these
members
must
be
freeholders.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
say
that...
well,
all
right.
go
on.
i
know
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
was
restricted
is
what
they
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
could
be
just
a
description
of...
not
the
facial
challenge,
but
of
the
"as
applied"
challenge.
that
maybe
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
governor
and
all
the
people
who...
who
selected
people
did
restrict
it
to
freeholders.
but
that
would
be
an
"as
applied"
challenge.
and
then
we
get
back
to
my
republican
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
were,
at
least,
making
our
job
harder.
i've
got
to
agree
with
you
there.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
when
they
did
that,
they
didn't
know
that
the
constitution
prohibited
your
having
a...
a
governmental
unit
like
this
composed
only
of
property
owners.
because
we
hadn't
told
them
that
yet,
had
we?
