mr.
o'keefe,
this
board,
i
take
it,
doesn't
actually
adopt
anything
itself,
does
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it...
but
the
plan
it
adopts
doesn't
have
the
force
of
law
until
it's
ratified
by
the
electors?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what...
what
case
of
ours
comes
closest,
do
you
think,
to
supporting
the
proposition
you're
maintaining
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you...
you
don't
base
your
argument
then
on
our...
the
kramer
v.
union
free
school
district
line
of
cases
where
we
say
that
you
can't
discriminate
among...
property
qualifications
for
voters?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
there
are
two
quite
different
lines
of
reasoning
i
would
have
thought.
one
is
what
you
said
earlier,
the
right
to
serve
in
a
governmental
capacity.
and
the
other
is
the
right
to
vote
on
matters
that
have
a
good
deal
of
concern
to
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
may
not
overcome
the
discrimination
insofar
as
the
opportunity
to
serve
is
concerned,
but
it
very
likely
would
overcome
any
discrimination
insofar
as
the
adoption
of
the
plan
is
concerned.
if
all
the
voters
have
a
right
to
vote,
it's
hard
to
see
they
are
discriminated
against
as
voters.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
there...
has
there
been
a
vote
on
the
plan?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
o'keefe.
mr.
buckner.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
o'keefe.
the
case
is
submitted.
