unknown
speaker
what
if--
unknown
speaker
yeah,
i'm--
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
or--
unknown
speaker
sure.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
there
isn't.
unknown
speaker
--uh-huh.
unknown
speaker
--was
restricted.
unknown
speaker
what
does
it
mean?
unknown
speaker
or
it
doesn't
mean
anything?
unknown
speaker
it's
just
a--
unknown
speaker
--a
wasted
word.
unknown
speaker
then
what
does
it
mean
to
the
people
in
missouri?
or
anyplace
else?
unknown
speaker
well,
now--
unknown
speaker
--lawyers
will
make
any
word
mean
anything
they
want
to
make.
[laughter]
i'm
talking
about
common
people.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
does
freeholder
apply
to?
unknown
speaker
does
it
mean--
unknown
speaker
--a
person?
does
it
mean
a
person?
i
mean,
could
it
be
a
dog
or
a
cat?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
mr.
buckner,
did
you
make
this
argument
to
the
supreme
court?
unknown
speaker
was
the
argument
made
on
behalf--
unknown
speaker
--of
the
state
to
the
board?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
and
yet
the
court's
opinion
appears,
at
least
to
me,
to
assume
that
it
means
property
owner.
unknown
speaker
the
court
simply
decided
it
on
that
assumption,
the
supreme
court
did.
unknown
speaker
the
district
court
didn't.
unknown
speaker
but
when
it
got
to
the
supreme
court,
one
has
the
impression
that
that
court
assumed
it
meant
there
is
a
property
ownership
requirement.
and
it
decided
the
federal
issue
on
that
assumption.
unknown
speaker
wait
a
minute.
you
think
they
decided
the
question
that
a
freeholder
does
not
have
to
be
a
land
owner
by
using
the
word
elector
instead
of
freeholder,
and
that
they
made
that
significant
constitutional
decision
in
the
statement
of
facts?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
then--
unknown
speaker
--would
they
need
to
have...
go
any
further?
if
they
didn't
mean
that,
why
would
they
then
go
on
and
give
a
reason,
say
this
doesn't
raise
an
equal
protection
problem
because
this
is
not
a
governmental
body?
unknown
speaker
that
doesn't
make...
they
didn't
need
to
say
that
unless
they...
they
said
that
against
the
background
of
property
ownership,
it
seems
to
me.
unknown
speaker
but
you...
so...
on
the
"as
applied"
basis,
you
agree
that...
that...
that
as
applied
they...
somebody
thinks
the
property
ownership
was
necessary?
unknown
speaker
and
so
must
you
defend
this
"as
applied"
case
here?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
but
the
county
executive
received
legal
advise
that
you
didn't
have
to
be
a
freeholder.
but,
what?
the
mayor
of
st.
louis
received
contrary
advise?
unknown
speaker
and
that
person
was...
the
person
who
was
excluded
in
st.
louis
city
is
not
a
party
to
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
if
that's
true,
why
is
the
"as
applied"
challenge
really
any
different
from
the
facial
challenge?
because,
as
it's
applied,
even
if
it
doesn't
mean
that,
apparently
all
the
lawyers
who
advised
the
governmental
officials
in
your
community
tell
them
that
this
is
what
it
means.
and
maybe
they're
wrong,
but
then
they
all
act
on
incorrect
advice.
so,
the
application
of
this
ambiguous
provision
is
exactly
the
same
as
if
it
meant
what
i
thought
it
meant
when
i
read
it.
unknown
speaker
no.
but
it's
applied
by
people
who
listen
to
their
lawyers.
and
their
lawyers
tell
them
that...
erroneously
perhaps...
that
it
requires
freeholders.
so,
as
applied
in
this...
it
just
doesn't
mean
they
happened
to
appoint
them.
they
appointed
them
because
they
were
told
by
the
people
from
whom
they
get
legal
advice
that
this
is
what
it
means.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
wasn't
raised,
your
explanation
for
the
missouri
supreme
court's
opinion
goes
up
in
smoke.
unknown
speaker
but
certainly
the
missouri
supreme
court
doesn't
differentiate
between
two
kinds
of
challenges.
unknown
speaker
they
don't
even
mention
the
"as
applied".
unknown
speaker
so
your
explanation
of
that
opinion
rests
on
the
assumption
they
carefully
categorized
these
two
different
legal
theories
and
disposed
of
one
of
them
in
the
statement
of
facts,
and
then
disposed
of
the
other
one
by...
by
making
this
governmental
powers
argument.
unknown
speaker
and
i
also
would
point
out
that
this...
the
federal
district
judge
who
read
this
just
thought
that
this
interpretation
was
really
off-the-wall.
he
thought
it
was...
there
was
absolutely
no
merit
to
it.
unknown
speaker
and
that's
the
one
unambiguous
description
of
what...
what
this
provision
means
by
a
judge
here.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
presumably
it
was
a
missouri
lawyer.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
should
we
do?
just
give
it
the
best
reading
we
can
and
interpret
that
opinion
as
we
best
understand
it?
unknown
speaker
are
we
permitted
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
you're
not
suggesting
that...
you're
not
suggesting
that
a
referendum
cures
every
equal
protection
violation
just
because
the
people
want
to
violate
somebody's
rights?
unknown
speaker
i
somehow
thought
we
were
being
asked
to
review
the
judgment
of
the
missouri
supreme
court
on
an
issue
of
federal
constitutional
law.
i
thought
that's
why
we
were
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
we
disagree
with
your
reading
of
it
and
we
read
their
opinion
as
being
based
on
the
assumption
that
the
missouri
constitution
requires
the
board
to
be
comprised
of
property
owners?
suppose
that's
how
we
read
it?
unknown
speaker
any
real
property
owner
or
just
a
real
property
owner
in
st.
louis?
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
representing
the
attorney
general.
what
do
you
think
it
means?
any
property
owner?
unknown
speaker
except
you
don't
think
they
have
to
be
real
property
owners
at
all?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
have
to
own
the
real
property
in
that
county?
or
do
you
have
to
be
a
person
in
that
county
who
owns
real
property
someplace?
the
missouri
constitution
does
not
draw
that
distinction.
well,
again,
if
i
may
impose,
what
is
your
position?
unknown
speaker
in
st.
louis?
unknown
speaker
or
one
of
the
affected
counties?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
this
court's
cases
in
turner
and
chappelle?
unknown
speaker
could
the
state
allow
or
provide
that
bills
in
the
legislature
could
only
be
introduced
by
property
owners?
unknown
speaker
may
i
go
back
a
moment
to
the
interpretation
of
the
missouri
supreme
court's
opinion.
in
essence,
you're
arguing
there
was
an
adequate
and
independent
state
ground
for
the
decision?
isn't
that
your--
unknown
speaker
--does
that
court
ever
cite
michigan
against
long
and
recognize
the
force
of
that
opinion
suggesting
that
when
it
intends
to
rely
on
an
independent
and
adequate
state
ground,
it
has
to
make
a
clear
statement
to
that
effect?
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
but
they
are
aware
of
that
doctrine,
i
hope.
unknown
speaker
no.
i
mean,
the
court
is
aware
of
that?
unknown
speaker
they
cite
it
in
other
cases?
unknown
speaker
the
clear
statement
that
the
missouri
supreme
court
intended
to
rest
its
decision
on
an
adequate
state
ground
rather
than
on
the
ground
that
it
argued...
that
it
discussed
about
not
exercising
governmental
powers,
which
i
gather
was
an
argument
that
you...
hadn't
even
been
made
in
that
court
before.
unknown
speaker
it's
a
rather
strange
way
to
clearly
rely
on
an
independent
and
adequate
state
ground.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
even
if
they
didn't
state
clearly
that
they
were
relying
on
an
independent
state
ground,
we...
we
still
are
confronted,
before
we
can
decide
the
federal
ground,
with
the...
with
the
difficulty
o'
interpreting
the
missouri
constitution,
without
any
interpretation
by
the
missouri
supreme
court
that's
clear
one
way
or
the
other.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose.
although
you
think
it's
clear
one
way
and
your
opponent
thinks
it's
clear
the
other.
i
don't
think
it's
clear,
myself.
unknown
speaker
counselor,
just
as
a
matter
of
curiosity.
the
missouri
supreme
court...
was
written
by
justice
donnelly,
wasn't,
it?
unknown
speaker
did
the
entire
court
sit
on
this
case?
unknown
speaker
the
full
court?
unknown
speaker
unanimous
opinion?
unknown
speaker
even
justice
blackmar?
unknown
speaker
mr.
buckner,
does
missouri
have
a
certification
procedure
barring
federal
courts
to
ask
the
state
supreme
court
what
it
means
by
something?
unknown
speaker
xxx
election?
unknown
speaker
can't
they
have
the
election?
is
there
an
injunction
against
the
election?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
thought
it
was
just
voluntarily
postponed.
no?
unknown
speaker
but
it's
the--
--is
that
from
the
district
court
or
the--
unknown
speaker
--from
a
state
court?
unknown
speaker
a
state
court
in
st.
louis.
so,
as
i
understand
it,
it's
the
official
position
of
the
state
of
missouri
that
homeowners
are
better
qualified
than
all
other
electors
to
participate
on
certain
governmental
units?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
your
position
that
that
comports
with
the
equal
protection
clause?
unknown
speaker
and,
therefore,
it
comports
with
the
equal
protection
clause?
unknown
speaker
it's
also
the
position
of
the
attorney
general
of
missouri,
i
gather,
that
the
missouri
constitution
doesn't
require
that?
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
clear
up
one
thing?
when
this...
when
article
30,
or
whatever
it
is,
was
adopted...
how
long
ago
was
this
constitutional
provision
adopted?
unknown
speaker
there
was
not
then
a
freeholder
requirement
for
state
electors,
was
there?
unknown
speaker
no,
just
for
voters
in
the
state
of
missouri?
unknown
speaker
okay.
well,
has
the
missouri
supreme
court
defined
what
a
freeholder
is
for
the
purposes
of
some
other
provisions
to
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
but
article
i
is
a
provision
that
requires
somebody
to
be
a
freeholder.
unknown
speaker
your
point
is
that
this
provision
doesn't
necessarily
require
somebody
to
be
a
freeholder.
he
just
calls
the
board
a
board
of
freeholders?
unknown
speaker
a
plain
obvious
reading
of
the
language?
unknown
speaker
yeah,
all
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
different
than
saying
that
the
board
of
freeholders
doesn't
mean
a...
that
they
have
to
be
freeholders.
unknown
speaker
well,
sure,
but--
unknown
speaker
--they're
judges
for
that
purpose.
unknown
speaker
so
freeholder
means...
might
mean...
might
mean
four
or
five
different
things,
depending
on
where
in
the
constitution
it
is.
unknown
speaker
and
even
if
they
happen
to
be
freeholders,
so-called,
that
doesn't
mean
they
have
to
own
real
property?
unknown
speaker
is
that
your
position
too?
unknown
speaker
has
the
attorney
general's
office
ever
taken
a
position
on
this?
unknown
speaker
have
you
ever
taken
the
public
position?
unknown
speaker
in
the
public...
did
you
ever
tell
the
public
that
freeholders
don't
mean
freeholders?
unknown
speaker
did
you
ever?
in
a
speech
or
anything?
did
you
do
this
anyplace
other
than
in
this
case?
did
you
ever
say
that
freeholders
didn't
mean
freeholder?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
it
you
must
have
taken
it
in
the
trial
court
here.
unknown
speaker
you
didn't
take
it
when
you
advised
the
governor,
though.
unknown
speaker
touche.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
buckner.
mr.
o'keefe,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
the...
what
about
the
district
court?
circuit
court.
i
mean
circuit
court.
unknown
speaker
so
there
has
been
a
court
who
says
that
the
term
is
meaningless.
unknown
speaker
mr.--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
o'keefe,
can
i
ask
this?
i
can
understand
how
your
clients
have
standing,
if
the
missouri
constitution
requires
these
people
to
be...
to
be
freeholders.
but,
let's
assume
that
i
don't
know
what
the
missouri
constitution
requires
and
let's
assume
i'm
just
looking
at
your
"as
applied"
challenge.
why
do...
why
do
your
clients
have
standing
on
the
"as
applied"
challenge
if
it
appears
that
the
only
people
on
the
list
of
names
submitted...
only
one
person
was
bumped
off
after
this
advice
was
given
and
that
person
is
not
among
your
clients?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
may
be
the
class,
but
what
about
the
named
plaintiff?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
guess
you
have
to
get
him
in
there.
i
guess
if
he's
in
the
class,
it's
all
right.
but
everybody
else
in
the
class
hasn't
been
harmed.
so,
it
really
turns,
then,
on
whether
he's
in
the
class.
unknown
speaker
that
goes
to
the
facial
challenge.
i
agree
that
if...
if
the
constitution
says
that,
there's
no
standing
problem.
i'm
only
worried
about
the
situation
if
the
constitution
doesn't
say
that
but
everybody
believed
it
says
that
and
everybody
acted
on
that
basis.
then
i
wonder
why
anybody,
except
father
reiner,
was
it--
unknown
speaker
--well,
in
rational
basis
cases
doesn't
the...
don't
our
cases
sometimes
suggest
that
if
a
court
can
dream
up
one--
unknown
speaker
--uh-huh.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
nevertheless--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
know,
but
judges
might
think
that...
that
they...
even
if
one
isn't
suggested,
the
judges
might
think
there
is
one.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
we
thought...
what
if
we
thought
there
was
a
perfectly
good
reason
for
that?
unknown
speaker
are
we
forbidden
to
affirm?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about...
how
about...
is
it
consistent
with
our
cases?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
certainly
are
cases
from
this
court
that
say
that
we
may
speculate
as
to
what
a
rational
basis
would
have
been.
williams
v.
lee
optical
company,--
unknown
speaker
--in
any
event,
we
do
speculate--
unknown
speaker
--and,
in
any
event,
we
do
speculate.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
believe
it,
mr.
o'keefe.
no.
unknown
speaker
after
all,
it's
just
a
wasted
word.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock.
