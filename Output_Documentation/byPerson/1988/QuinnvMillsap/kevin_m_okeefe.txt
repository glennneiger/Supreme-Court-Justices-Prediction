mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
appeal
from
a
final
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
missouri.
appellants,
as
certified
by
the
courts
below,
are
a
class
comprising
all
registered
voters
of
the
state
of
missouri
who
do
not
also
own
real
property.
at
issue
is
section
30
of
article
vi
of
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
missouri,
a
provision
authorizing
the
creation
and
operation
of
a
board
of
freeholders,
which
is
an
ad
hoc,
tax-supported,
public
governmental
body
authorized
the
exclusive
authority
to
prepare
and
submit
to
the
electorate
of
the
st.
louis
metropolitan
area
a
plan
for
local
government
reorganization
including
the
partial
or
complete
government
of
all
or
any
part
of
the
city
of
st.
louis
and
st.
louis
county.
the
case
was
originally
submitted
on
cross-motions
for
summary
judgment
and
stipulated
facts.
the
challenge
to
the
section
30,
both
on
its
face
and
as
applied,
in
the
instance
of
the
creation
of
the
present
board
of
freeholders
in
this
area,
was
overruled
by
the
missouri
supreme
court
on
the
grounds
that
the
equal
protection
guarantees
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
are
irrelevant
to
the
discrimination
suffered
by
the
appellant
class
because,
in
the
court's
words,
the
board
of
freeholders
fails
to
exercise
"general
governmental
power".
the
question
thus
presented
in
the
court
this
afternoon
is
whether
the
state
of
missouri
may,
by
the
operation
of
its
state
constitution
and
the
activities
of
appointing
authorities
operating
under
that
provision,
extend
to
one
class
of
citizens...
to
wit,
property
owners,
the
owners
of
real
property...
the
opportunity
for
public
service
and
participation
in
a
critical
aspect
of
state
and
local
governmental
operation
and,
at
the
same
time,
withhold
an
equivalent
opportunity
for
service
and
participation
to
the
members
of
the
appellant
class
solely
because
the
appellants
do
not
own
an
interest
in
real
property.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
your
honor,
the
circumstances,
of
course,
are
not
that
there
is
a
requirement
for
a
representative
array
of
board
members.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
i
do
not
believe
that
property
ownership
would
be
a
disqualification
for
service,
as
is
the
lack
of
property
ownership.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
believe
that
the
ownership
of
property
bears
any
rational
relationship
to
the
authority
that
a
board
of
freeholders
enjoys.
as
such,
either
its
absence
or
its
presence,--
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
--well,
there
is
a
reference
in
section
30(b)
of
the
missouri
constitution
to
the
levying
of
the
property
tax.
that
has
been
interpreted
by
the
state
constitution,
however,
as
to...
that
it
involves
the
levy
of
both
personal
and
real
property
taxes.
there
are
no
exclusively
real
property
issues.
the
boundary
lines
of
governmental
entities
are
certainly
not
real
property
issues.
the
creation
of
a
sewer
district
serves
renters
and
property-owners
alike,
and
similar
proposals
within
the
current
plan,
particularly
the
reduction
of
the
property
tax
and
the
imposition
of
an
earnings
tax
in
lieu
of
it,
are
certainly
not...
do
not
demonstrate
that
the
absence
of
ownership
of
property
should
disqualify
an
individual.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
it
does
adopt
a
plan.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
that
is
correct.
if
it
is
ratified...
adopted
by
the
electorate
in
the
locality...
that
is,
the
city
and
county
of
st.
louis...
it
becomes
the
organic
law
of
the
territory
and
supersedes
all
conflicting
state
statues.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
your
honor,
i
believe
turner
v.
fouche
is
the
most
clear
statement
of
the
law
that
the
equal
protection
guarantees
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
protect
the
right
of
each
citizen
to
an
equal
opportunity
for
service.
in...
when
the
state
extends
to
one
segment
of
the
population
an
opportunity
for
service,
that
it
is
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
guarantees
to
withhold
a
similar
opportunity
to
another
segment
of
the--
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
--to
the
contrary,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
voting
rights
questions
in
kramer,
and
a
variety
of
other
cases
including
reapportionment
cases,
candidate
ballot
questions
such
as
bullock
v.
carter
and
lubin
v.
panish,
are
all
highly
relevant
to
the
consideration
of
this
provision.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
your
honor,
first
of
all,
the
subsequent
opportunity
to
vote
does
not
overcome
the
discrimination
which
occurs
when
the
board
is
first
put
into
place.
that
is
the
act
of
discrimination.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
that
the
reasoning
articulated
by
this
court
in
bullock
and
lubin
which
concerned
candidate
restrictions,
qualifications
restricting
candidates
seeking
an
access
to
the
ballot
in
a
primary
election,
recognized
that
when
an
identifiable
segment
of
the
voting
public
has
their
perspective
artificially
barred
from
the
ballot,
that
they
suffer
a
diminution
of
the
right
of
franchise
and
suffer
an
abridgement
of
their
right
to
vote.
the
concomitant
effect
of
an
exclusion
of
a
segment
of
society
from
one
level
of
participation
has
an
impact
on
the
exercise
of
the
right
to
vote,
and
that
it
is
this
exercise
which
in
fact
elevates
the
concern
in
the
constitutional
failure
of
section
30,
that
those
who
do
not
own
real
property
are
allowed
to
participate
only
at
the
back
end
of
the
process.
they
may
be
naysayers,
they
may
be
able
to
vote
down
a
plan.
and
if
they
do,
and
if
they,
along
with
the
rest
of
society,
still
seek
to
improve
the
operations
of
their
government,
they
can
only
do
so
if
another
board
of
freeholders
would
propose
a
plan.
and
if
that
plan
is
not
satisfactory,
they
may
attempt
to
participate
in
turning
it
down.
but
they
have
no
opportunity
to--
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
--see
their
public
policy
perspective--
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
--well--
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
--both
republicans
and
democrats
have
an
equal
opportunity
to
participate
in
the
state
legislature.
the
appellant
class
does
not.
the
appellant
class
is
barred
from
the
opportunity
to
participate
in
the
critical
decision-making
process
which
precedes
the
submission
of
the
issue
on
the
ballot.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
well,
your
honor,
the
appointing
authorities,
the
respondents,
mayor,
governor
and
county
executive,
did
not
in
fact
of
their
own
volition
apply
a
property
ownership
requirement.
counsel
for
the
city
and
the
county
advised
the
executive
authorities
that
property
ownership
was
a
requirement.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
well,
because
the
law
required
it,
in
fact,
a
nominee
such
as
father
reiner,
the
president
emeritus
of
st.
louis
university,
was
withdrawn
from
service
by
application
of
the
principle.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
your
honor,
if...
if
the
appointing
authorities...
which,
of
course,
are
not
the
facts
situations...
but,
if
the
appointing
authorities
under
some
circumstance
were
to
believe
that
among
other
factors
it
was
advantageous
that
some
of
the
appointees
also
own
property,
that
may
or
may
not,
given
their
perspective,
be
a
rational
basis
for
them
to
use
as
a
factor.
but,
when,
as
here,
they
cannot
utilize
that,
that
factor
is
used
as
a
bar
to
one
segment
for
service--
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
--not
as
a--
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
--you
are
correct,
justice
scalia.
what
the
"as
applied"
argument
is,
is
that
if
the
appointing
authorities
got
bad
advice,
as
you
indicated...
if
they
made
a
mistake
as
to
what
the
law
required,
nonetheless,
they
did
apply
the
standard--
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
--that
all
nominees
were
measured
against
that
criteria--
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
--yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that--
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
--well,
that
would
violate
the
facial
terms
of
section
30
which
require
bipartisan
representation.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
aside
from--
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
--aside
from
the
minor
detail,
the
exercise
of
discretion
based
on
political
affiliation
i
believe
this
court
has
endorsed
in
policy-making
positions.
i
don't
believe
that
this
board
would
be
any...
would
be
outside
the
scope
of
policy-making
bodies.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
would
not
be.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
i
believe
it
is.
and,
as
such,
that
would
be
one
criteria
which
may,
with
others,
reasonably
be
applied.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
i
believe
it
is
done.
i
think
there
may
be
a
significant
problem
with
proof
to
establish
that
fact.
but
i
don't
believe
that
given
the
nature
of
this
body...
that
it
is
autonomous
and
independent
and
has
a
significant
broad-based
impact
on
policy...
that
it
would
necessarily
fall
outside
the
purview
where
this
court
has
previously
authorized
political
considerations
at
policy
level.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
it
is
not
self-perpetuating.
it
is
authorized
to
be
created
for
a
period
of
one
year.
it
is
an
ad
hoc
body,
tax-supported,
and
operates
only
until
it
files
a
plan,
which
is
a
maximum
time
period
of
one
year.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
they...
they
have
achieved
it.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
in
fact,
the
history
is
that
the
city
and
county
were
so-called
divorced
in
1876,
and
this
provision
was
entered
in
the
missouri
constitution
by
an
initiative
in
1924
primarily
for
the
purpose
of
allowing
for
that
remarriage,
if
you
will,
between
the
city
and
the
county
of
st.
louis.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
would
be
consistent
with
about
700
years
of
common
law,
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
term
freeholder,
which
has,
to
my
knowledge,
no
appellate
decision
has
found
it
to
be
independent
of
the
ownership
interest
in
real
property.
in
fact,
the
missouri
supreme
court
also
has
defined
the
constitutional
use
of
the
word
freeholder
in
the
case
of
shivley
v.
langford,
cited
in
our
reply
brief,
to
specifically
require
the
ownership
of
a
fee-interest
in
real
property.
lands,
tenements,
or--
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
--it
is.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
the
definition
of
the
word
freeholder,
your
honor?
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
no.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
it
says
freeholder,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
i
would
seek
both,
your
honor.
that--
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
--what
was
sought
in
the
complaint
below
is
a
declaration
of
invalidity
and
injunctive
relief
against
its
enforcement,
including
as
to
the
present
board.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
is
the
state
of
missouri,
the
appointing
authorities,
and
the
members
of
the
board
of
freeholders.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
section
30's
provisions.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
yes,
your
honor.
we
sought
the...
we
sought
relief
before
a
plan
was
proposed
and
sought
injunction
against
the
further
operations
of
the
board.
and
that
would
include
the
product
of
an
illegally-constituted
body
in
this
instance.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
there
has
not
been
a
vote
on
the
plan.
it
was
scheduled
for
june
20th
of
this
year.
a
lower
court
in
st.
louis
county
has
delayed
the
election,
pending
the
resolution
of
this
appeal.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
in
the
pleadings
filed
with
the
state
court
in
our
cross-petition
for
relief,
we
pointed
out
that
the
exclusion
of
non-property
owners
from
participation
in
the
board
can
result
in
a
biased
plan
and
infringe
on
the
rights
of
voters.
that's
located
in
the
joint
appendix,
if
i
can
find
it.
the--
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
--there
was
no
specific
discussion
of
the
voter
impact--
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
--issue
in
the
missouri
supreme
court.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
we
have,
your
honor.
we
have,
first
of
all,
the
definition
of
the
term
as
used
in
the
missouri
constitution,
from
which
there
has
been
no
withdrawal
or
retreat
by
the
missouri
supreme
court.
we
have,
secondly,
a
missouri
supreme
court
decision
which
discusses
only
issues
of
federal
constitutional
law.
under
the
rule
of
necessity,
it
did
not
determine
that
this
matter
could
be
resolved
by
any
ambiguity
or
uncertainty
in
state
law
issues.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
it
calls
them
the
board
of--
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
--well,
of
course,
the
missouri
supreme
court
is
bound
to
interpret
its
constitution
and
construe
it
consistent
with
the
past
opinions
and
principles--
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
--of
construction.
the
use
of
the
word
freeholder
is
also
found
in
article
vi,
section
18(g)
concerning
county
boards
of
freeholders
to
prepare
local
charters
for
counties,
including
st.
louis
county,
and
in
section
32(b)
of
article
vi
concerning
a
freeholder
board
for
the
city
of
st.
louis
to
prepare
a
charter.
and
in
those
uses,
the
number
of
members
precedes
the
use
of
the
term
freeholders
so
that
it
reads,
"there
shall
be
a
board
consisting
of
14
freeholders.
"
and
thirteen
freeholders.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
in
this
instance,
by--
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
--pardon
me?
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
in
this
instance,
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
number
is
stated
after
the
word
as
opposed
to
before
it,
i
don't
think
amounts
to
a
constitutional
distinction
between
the
two
perspectives.
in
addition,
of
course,
the
language
utilizes...
the
section
refers
to
the
fact
that
the
freeholders
of
the
city
and
county
will
establish
compensation
rate
for
the
freeholder
from...
the
19th
freeholder...
and
that
the
election
is
to
be
set
on
the
date
set
by
the
"freeholders".
so,
the
section
uses
the
term
"members"
in
some
instances,
and
"freeholders"
in
others.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
well,
justice
scalia,
i
could...
i
could
suggest
to
you
that,
as
was
mentioned
in
the
prior
argument,
the
trial
court
in
this
case
took
a
position
such
as
that
you
are
discussing
here,
that
the
name
is
titular
only
and
not
a
requirement
for
office.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
that
opinion
went
to
the
missouri
supreme
court.
as
is
in
the
case
in
other
opinions
of
law,
by
trial
courts,
particularly
those
on
stipulated
facts,
the
missouri
supreme
court
gave
no
deference
to
that
opinion
and
did
not
articulate
it,
preserve
it,
reflect
it
in
any
manner.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
i
think
there
is
such
a
line,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
membership
on
the
board
is
restricted
to
owners
of
real
property.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
was
restricted
to--
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
--yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
well,
your
honor,
they
did
not
separate
the
"as
applied"
and
facial
challenges
or
concerns
about
the
section
in
their
decision.
the
missouri
supreme
court
also,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
recognize,
addressed
this
case
because
there
was
an
abstention
order
by
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
so,
missouri
was
fully
aware
of
the
fact,
the
missouri
supreme
court,
as
referenced
in
its
opinion,
that
it
was
being
given
an
opportunity
to
address...
identify,
address,
and
resolve
any
state
law
issues
which
might
obviate
the
challenge,
and
did
not
do
so.
mr.
kevin
m.

it
is
the
position
of
the
appellants
that
in
essence
the
rights
which
the
appellant
class
seeks
to
preserve
are
the
identical
rights
recognized
and
articulated
by
this
court
in
the
turner
decision,
that
it
is
the
right
to
equal
treatment,
the
equal
opportunity
for
service
which
the
turner
decision
so
jealously
guarded.
the
right
to
be
free,
in
the
turner
language,
from
the
burden
of
an
invidiously
discriminatory
disqualification
by
which
one
segment
of
society
is
offered
either
a
privilege,
a
right,
or
an
opportunity
by
the
state.
and,
for
irrational
and
illogical
reasons,
the
class
consisting
of
the
appellants
was
excluded
from
an
equal
opportunity
for
that
right.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
your
honor,
i
believe
that
even
under
the
minimum
rational
basis
test,
as
articulated
in
turner,
that
the
freeholder
qualification
of
section
30
falls.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
i
believe
it
appeared
to
be
a
logically
consistent
and
appropriate
application
of
a
rational
basis
test.
i
believe,
however
that
there
are...
there
is
one
set
of
factors
which
make
the
appellant
circumstances
in
this
case
even
more
compelling
than
the
issues
in
turner.
and
that
is,
as
was
discussed
previously.
the
concomitant
impact
which
the
exclusion
of
the
appellant
class
from
service
on
the
board
has
on
that
class'
rights
as
voters.
and
when...
as
in
the
cases
of
bullock
v.
carter
and
lubin
v.
panish...
candidates
seeking
nearly
access
to
the
ballot
for
a
primary
election,
never
to
exercise
any
"general
governmental
power"
or
any
power
whatsoever,
other
than
the
opportunity
to
stand
again
for
election,
when
this
court
has
considered
restrictions
which
impede
the
opportunity
of
citizens
to
seek
access
to
the
ballot,
you
have
found...
and
i
think
quite
appropriately...
that
no
such
standard
can
survive
constitutional
scrutiny
absent
it
being
reasonably
necessary,
and,
therefore,
surviving
a
heightened
level
of
constitutional
scrutiny.
there
is
no
difference
between
the
opportunity
for
service
on
the
board
of
freeholders
so
that
you
can
dictate
access
to
the
ballot
for
the
proposition,
and
the
opportunity
for
service...
opportunity
to
stand
for
election
in
the
primary
election.
i
think
that
that
factor
also
would
indicate
that
the
standard
to
be
applied
should
be
heightened.
but
that
under
either
standard,
that
the
constitutional
equal
protection
deprivations
of
section
30
must
be
declared
invalid.
unless
there
are
additional
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
i
do,
your
honor.
the
shotgun
arguments
from
the
other
side
leave
a
lot
of
stray
pellets
that
i'd
like
to
try
to
pick
up
very
briefly.
first
of
all,
there
is
no
question
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
word
freeholder
in
the
english
language
or
in
the
common
law.
i
think
the
state's
assertion
that
it
has
suddenly
become
mere
surplusage,
contrary
to
the
rules
of
constitutional
construction
in
the
missouri
constitution,
that
it
has
become
devoid
of
meaning.
were
there
a
single
appellate
decision
of
any
court
in
the
english-speaking
world
in
the
700
years
since
the
foundations
of
common
law
to
support
that
position,
it
might
have
more
merit.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
the...
the
st.
louis
county
circuit
court,
trial
bench,
as
a
conclusion
of
law,
ruled
that
a
freeholder
qualification
was
not
necessary,
and
as
a
matter
of
dicta,
suggested
that
the
term
may
have
no
meaning.
that's
as
far
as--
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
--well,
as
a
matter
of
dictum,
the
trial
court
in
this
case
postulated
that
that
was
a
potential.
the
missouri
supreme
court,
of
course,
did
not
adopt
that
finding,
or
that
conclusion.
and,
in
fact,
one
of
the
things
which
concerns
the
appellants
is
the
very
issue
which
justice
scalia
raised.
the
red
herring
approach
of
the
state's
wishing
that
there
was
an
ambiguity
in
the
missouri
supreme
court's
decision
doesn't
make
it
so.
the
fact
that
they
focused
a
lot
of
attention
to
debate
a
hypothetical
ambiguity
doesn't
make
an
ambiguity.
what
the
other
side
seeks
to
do
is
to
read
into
the
missouri
supreme
court
what
they
did
not
say,
and
to
read
out
of
the
missouri
supreme
court's
opinion
what
they
did
say.
and
that
is,
first
of
all,
inconsistent
with
the
authority
and
jurisdiction
of
the
missouri
supreme
court
to
interpret
the
state
statutes
and
constitution
of
that
state
as
it
sees
fit.
and
it
is
also
inconsistent
with
the
findings
of
the
missouri
supreme
court
when
it
specifically
defined
the
constitutional
use
of
the
term
freeholder.
there
is--
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
--no
ambiguity.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
to
the
contrary,
your
honor.
father
reiner
is
a
member
of
the
class.
the
class
in
this
case
is
every
person
who
could
be
subjected
to
discrimination
on
the
property
ownership
requirement.
the
class
consists
of
every
registered
voter
in
the
state
of
missouri
who
does
not
own
real
property.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
your
honor,
we
are
before
the
court
as
the
defendants
in
a
case
put
out
by
the
state.
they
designated
the
named
parties;
they
defined
the
class.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
for
them
to
come
now
and
suggest
that
we
are
not
appropriate
parties
raises
some
substantial
questions
as
to
what
sort
of
a
judgment
we
are
appealing
from.
excuse
me.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that's
necessary.
both
in
turner
where
the...
at
footnote
23
in
the
turner
decision
where
this
court
discussed
the
fact
that
the
local
authorities
can
be
relied
upon
or
expected
to
obey
the
state
law,
and
also
in
carter
v.
green
county
jury
commissioners
decided
the
same
day,
where
the
court
recognized--
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
--well,
first
of
all,
governor
ashcroft,
one
of
the
appellees,
and
the
person
responsible
for
selecting
the
19th
member
of
the
board,
did
specify
that
he
did
not
consider
and
would
not
consider
anyone
who
did
not
own
real
property.
it
was
an
applied
criterion
in
the
governor's
choice
from
among
all
the
registered
voters
in
the
state
who
do
not
reside
in
the
city
or
county
of
st.
louis.
so,
certainly,
all
of
them
are
clearly
specifically,
and
factually,
within
the
class.
the...
the
questions
also
suggest
the
state's
position
that
there
is
a
rational
basis
for
this
criteria.
of
course,
first
of
all,
the
missouri
supreme
court
has
not
identified
any
legitimate
state
objective
which
it
claims
is
served
by
the
exclusion
of
non-property
owners,
non-freeholders
from
service
on
this
body.
secondly,
even
the
trial
court--
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
--generally,
your
honor,
they're
required
to
at
least
dream
it
up
before
they
finish
the
case.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
as
opposed
to
relying
on
this
court
to--
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
--dream
up
a
justification
for
them.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
well,
your
honor,
unless
they
articulate
what
that
might
be,
it's
very
difficult
for
this
court
to
hypothesize
what
reasoning
may
have
gone
into
a
decision
which
does
not
support
that.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
your
honor--
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
--if
you
believed
that
was
consistent
with
constitutional...
equal
protection
analysis--
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
--i
believe
it
is
not
in...
it
is
not
consistent
with
your
cases
to
make
such
a
conclusion.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
your
honor,
i'm
not
going
to
confess...
i'm
not
going
to
assert
that
i'm
familiar
with
that
particular
decision.
in
general,
i--
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
--pardon
me?
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
well,
certainly,
in
this
case
you
wouldn't
speculate.
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
pardon
me?
mr.
kevin
m.
o'keefe
well,
your
honor,
that...
it
is
the
state's
contention
that
it's
a
wasted
word.
but,
of
course,
there...
every
use
of
the
words
in
the
constitution
are
presumed
intentional
and
meaningful
and
not
surplusage.
i'd
also
like
to
just
point
out
that
the
state
has
conceded
that
it
believes
that
this
board
of
freeholders...
first
of
all,
it
abandoned
the
reasoning
of
the
missouri
supreme
court
to
justify
the
relief
they
seek
now,
but
also
that
they
have
contended
that
the
board
of
freeholders
process
is
equivalent
to
the
state
legislature
and
the
right
of
initiative,
and
have
even
suggested
to
this
court
that
it
would
be
an
appropriate
application
of
a
rational
standard
to
limit...
in
response
to
the
question
asked
previously...
to
limit
the
opportunity
to
introduce
bills
in
the
missouri
legislature
to
only
property
owners.
presumably
they
also
suggest
it
would
be
rational
to
limit
the
right
of
initiative
to
property
owners.
essentially
what
they
are
suggesting
is
that
missouri
is
to
be
a
two-tiered
class...
a
two-class
society.
one
class,
the
landed
gentry
allowed
to
participate
at
the
front
and
back
end
of
the
governmental
process,
while
those
who
do
not
enjoy
the
privilege,
are
allowed
to
participate
only
at
the
back
end
of
the
process.
a
hundred
and
forty-seven
years
ago
this
month,
the
citizens
of
the
state
of
rhode
island
went
into
rebellion.
armed
rebellion
in
the
streets
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
right
of
the
participation
in
government,
free
of
a
property
ownership
qualification.
the
doors
rebellion
was
a
sad
chapter
in
that
state's
history
and
in
this
country's
history.
but
the
appellants
in
this
case
seek
no
more
greater
right
than
that.
thank
you,
your
honor.
