mr.
o'keefe,
how
long
does
this
board
last?
it's...
it's
not
a
self-perpetuating
board,
certainly,
is
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it's
pretty
hard
to
get
a
plan
out
in
one
year,
isn't
it?
justice
harry

blackmun
it's
been
going
on
for
some
time,
and
the
county
and
the
city
like
to
stay
apart.
justice
harry

blackmun
of
course,
the
very
name
of
it
implies
land
ownership.
at
least,
the
term
freeholder
has
always
been
that
way
for
me.
