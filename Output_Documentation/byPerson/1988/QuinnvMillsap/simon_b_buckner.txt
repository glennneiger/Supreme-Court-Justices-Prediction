mr.
simon
b.
buckner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state,
perhaps
not
surprisingly,
has
a
slightly
different
perspective
on
this
case
than
that
enunciated
by
the
appellants.
what's
important
to
remember
is
that
65
years
ago
the
people
of
the
state,
that
is,
the
whole
state
of
missouri,
decided
that
there
might
come
a
time
when
the
people
of
st.
louis
city
and
county
would
want
to
reorganize
the
metropolitan
government.
to
that
end,
the
people
of
the
state
invoked
the
state
initiative
process.
they
passed
petitions
throughout
the
state,
gathered
signatures
from
every
congressional
district
in
the
state,
and
voted
to
adopt
a
process.
this
was
the
only
thing
on
the
ballot...
or,
pardon
me...
it
wasn't
like
adopting
a
constitution.
it
was
one
issue
and
the
people
of
the
state
voted
to
do
this.
they
voted
to
adopt
a
process
whereby
the
mayor
of
st.
louis
city,
the
county
executive
of
st.
louis
county,
and
the
governor,
each
appointed
a
number
of
people
to
a
board,
a
committee,
whatever.
in
this
case
it
was
called
the
board
of
freeholders,
and
this
group
of
people
have
exactly
one
function,
and
that
is
to
propose
a
plan
for
the
reorganization
of
metropolitan
st.
louis
government.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
if
the
reference
is
to
turner
v.
fouche,
you're
right.
that
case
is
later
than
that.
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
my
position...
it
is
the
state's
position,
as
you
suggested
earlier...
that
it
is
not
clear
that
the
missouri
constitution
limits
membership
on
this
board
to
owners
of
real
property.
the
appeal
is
essentially
based
on
one
sentence
that
you've
heard.
we
recognize
membership
on
the
board
of
freeholders
was
restricted--
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
--there
is
nothing
in
the
missouri
constitution
that
speaks
to
that
point.
there
is,
i
believe,
a
statute
that
refers
to
a
freeholder
as
one
who
owns
a
certain
number
of
chickens.
but
we
have
a
number
of
cases
in
missouri,
and
in
particular,
the
ones
in
this
line
of
cases
that
form
the
basis
of
the
appeal
today.
and,
in
addition,
there
was
another
trial
court
opinion
which,
of
course,
was
not--
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
--that
says
that
when
the
word
freeholder
is
used
in
this
context,
it
should
be
understood
in
a
public
law
context,
as
opposed
to
a
property
law
context.
and
in
the
public
law
context,
the
word
freeholder
does
not
impose
any
limitation
of
the
sort
urged
by
the
appellants
today.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
in
this
case
the
trial
court
held
that
it
was...
it
imposed
no
limitation
over
and
above
the
word
"elector".
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
that
is
what
the
trial
court--
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
--said.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
well,
it
is
a
wasted
word
in
the
sense
that
it
is
a
word
that
is
being
used
to
name
the
board.
in
a
property
law
context,
it
means
owner
of
real
property.
in
a
public
law
context,
in
this
particular
case,
it
is
just
a
descriptive
word
that
is
used
to
name
the
board.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
to
the
lawyers
who
study
real
property
law,
it
means--
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
--owner
of
real
property.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
well,
i
would
draw
an
analogy
to
the
use
of
the
word
"judge",
which
is
used
in
all
sorts
of
varieties
and
means
different
things
in
different
contexts.
here
today,
we
would
say
that
the
judge...
the
judge
refers
to
somebody
who
tries
cases
or
hears
appeals.
in
another
context,
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
brief,
judge,
referring
to
a
member
of
the
county
court
of
jackson
county...
we
referred
to
harry
truman
as
the
presiding
judge
of
that
county,
but
harry
truman
wasn't
a
lawyer.
he
didn't
exercise
any
judicial
power.
it
was
merely
the
name
we
applied
to
a
member
of
this
group.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
in
this
case,
the
word
freeholder
is
not
a
word
of
limitation
that
applies
to
the--
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
--members
of
this
board.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
no,
your
honor.
in
this
case
section
30(a)
refers
to
members
of
a
board
and
talks
about
appointees.
section
3o(b)
speaks
of
freeholders.
that
is,
people
who
are
members
of
this
board.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
i
personally
did
not
make
the
argument.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
that
the
word--
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
--that
the
word
freeholder
did
not
act
as
a
limitation--
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
--to
membership?
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
there
are
a
variety--
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
--well--
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
--i
think--
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
--as
was
pointed
out
a
short
while
ago,
there
were
two
arguments
brought
to
the
trial
court
and
to
the
supreme
court.
number
one,
is
this
provision
unconstitutional
on
its
face?
number
two,
is
it
unconstitutional
as
applied?
i
would
submit
that
on
its
face
we
have
the
statement
at
the
outset
of
the
supreme
court
opinion
that
says
in
so
many
words,
section
30
required
both
the
mayor
of
st.
louis
and
the
county
supervisor
of
st.
louis
county
to
appoint
nine
electors
to
the
board.
in
addition,
the
governor
of
missouri
was
required
to
appoint
one
elector
to
the
board.
that
appears
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
at
appendix
page
two.
the
court
needed
to
go
on
and
discuss
the
"as
applied"
problem.
we
needed
to
do
something.
and
the
court
went
on
and
it
felt
that
the
cases
discussing--
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
--i
am
submitting
that
we
have
looked
at
the
text
of
the
constitution
which
says
that
the
board
shall
consist
of
19
members,
as
you
noted,
without
reference
to
the
word
freeholder
or
to
ownership
of
real
property.
the
trial
court
looked
at
that
and
said
specifically...
and
this
is
at
page
a-17
of
the
jurisdictional
statement...
it
quoted
the
constitutional
language
of
the
missouri
constitution
and
said
the
only
qualification
for
members
is
that
they
be
electors.
the
missouri
supreme
court
went
on
and
found,
and
said,
that
section
30
required
these
people
to
be
electors
and
then,
in
what
i
will
admit
is
a
highly
ambiguous
statement
at
the
end,
said,
"we
recognize
membership
on
the
board
of
freeholders
was
restricted
to
owners
of....
"
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
"#
real
property".
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
we--
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
--we
have
the
fact
that
both
sides
have
stipulated
to,
that
all
the
members
of
the
board
were
in
fact
owners
of
real
property.
thus,
we
have
a
problem
with
the
constitution
as
applied,
if
it
were,
and
we
need
to
come
up
with
some
sort
of
reason.
and
the
court
came
up
with
an
analysis
that--
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
--i
know
that
the
counsel
for
both
st.
louis
city
and
st.
louis
county
so
advised
the
appointing
authorities.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
i
think
not.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
number
one,
because,
as
i
have
suggested,
we've
moved
from
state
to
federal
court
now,
and
these
particular
appellants
were
not
discriminated
against
in
any
way.
because
we
have
stipulated
that
it
would
have
to
be
the
county
executive
to
appoint
them,
and
the
county
executive
made
his
determination,
we
have
stipulated,
without
considering
whether
these
people
owned
real
property.
so,
these
people
would
not
have
been
injured
on
an
"as
applied"
basis.
in
addition--
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
--no,
your
honor.
in
each
case,
the
executive
came
up
with
a
list
of
nine
names.
after
coming
up
with
the
list
of
names,
each
of
these
executives
received
legal
advice.
in
the
case
of
the
county,
the
legal
advice
was
these
people
need
to
be
owners
of
real
property.
they
looked
at
the
list
of
names.
all
these
people,
as
it
happened,
did
own
real
property.
so,
there
was
no
change
made.
in
st.
louis
city,
the
mayor
came
up
with
a
list
of
nine
people.
he
received
the
same
legal
advice
and
went
down
the
list
and
determined
that
one
of
the
persons
did
not
own
real
property,
and
he
was
excluded
from
the...
another
person
was
appointed
in
his
place.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
that
is
correct.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
as
mr....
as
brother
o'keefe
pointed
out
in
his
brief,
the
law
of
missouri
is
determined
not
by
the
appointing
officials,
but
by
the
court,
the
missouri
supreme
court.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
i
have
several
responses
to
the
problem
"as
applied".
as
i
observed
in
my
brief,
my
reading
of
this
tends
to
lead
me
to
the
conclusion
that
"as
applied"
really
wasn't
raised
in
that
we
have
the
statement
in--
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
--it
was
not
raised
when
brought
to
this
court.
raised
below,
but
not
in
this
court.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
i...
i
agree
that
the
missouri
supreme
court--
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
--as
justice
scalia
observed,
the
court
could
have
made
my
job
easier
too.
[laughter]
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
that's
correct.
that
is--
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
--but
we
have
a...
in
this
case,
a
federal
judge
interpreting
the--
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
--missouri
constitution.
and,
fortunately,
in
my
case--
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
--yes,
he
is.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
i
think
not.
that
is
certainly--
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
--that
is
certainly
one
thing
that
you
may
do,
is
look
at
that
question.
as
i
suggested
in
the
brief,
this
is
really
a
legislative
process
and
this
court
does
not
have
the...
well,
this
court
may
review
two
things
in
connection
with
the
legislative
processes.
first,
the
result.
what
comes
out.
when
a
plan
is
adopted
and...
voted
on
by
the
people
and
adopted
by
the
people,
this
court
may
review
the
way
that
that
plan
meshes
with
the
federal
constitution.
that's
not
a
controversial
issue
of
law.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
well,
as
justice
stewart
suggested
in
the
town
of
lockport
decision,
there
are
different
considerations
that
apply
to
legislative
acts...
or,
pardon
me...
one
class
of
votes
and
referenda.
in
particular,
i
think
that
what
saves
this
process
is
that
we
have
a
vote
by
the
people
of
the
state
of
missouri
to
establish
this
process,
and
we
have
a
vote
of
the
affected
people
at
the
back
end.
it's
not
as
was
suggested
a
while
ago,
we
have
the
people
backing
in
and
approving
or
disapproving.
we
have
the
approval
of
the
people
at
the
outset
as
well.
i
suggested
that
this
court
may
review
the
result.
we
also
know
from
cases
like
baker
v.
carr
and
reynolds
v.
sims
that
this
court
is
very
jealous
of
and
protects
the
right
to
vote.
as
was
suggested
earlier
today,
this
really
is
not
a
right
to
vote
case.
nobody
questions
that
any
person
is
being
disenfranchised.
nobody
questions
that
any
vote
has
been
diluted.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
but
whether
that...
justice
o'connor,
you're
correct,
and
that
is
why
the
appellants
appealed
this
case
here.
but
in
order
to
exercise
that
jurisdiction,
there
has
to
be
a
live
controversy.
and
if
the
missouri
supreme
court
and
the
lower
court
have
determined
and
can
construe
the
constitution
in
such
a
way
that
that
federal
issue
does
not
arise--
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
--then
there
are
two
questions
that
arise.
first,
as
to
whether
this
is
a
justiciable
controversy.
second,
as
to
whether
there
is
a
rational
basis
for
such
a
requirement.
we
have
suggested...
well,
there's
several
potentially
rational
bases
for
this,
and
the
trial
court
suggested,
for
example,
that
this
board
considers
land
use
issues
and
that
real
property
owners
may
be
better
equipped
to
consider
questions
of
land
use
than
people
who
do
not
hold
real--
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
--the
trial
court
did
not
make
any
such
distinction.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
i
think
that
from
looking
at
the
text
of
the
missouri
constitution
that
since
nine
persons
are
required
to
be
electors
of
st.
louis
county
and
nine
of
st.
louis
city,
and
one
of
some
other
county
in
the
state,
that
presumably
they
would
be
real
property
holders
in
those
counties.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
you're
right.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
yes,
sir.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
i
think
that
it
is
rational
to
assume
that
when
the
people
of
the
state
of
missouri
voted
to
adopt
this
provision
that
they
intended
this
language
to
mean
persons
who
reside
in
and
own
real
property...
in
fact,
were
homeowners,
since
that
is
the
most
common
form
of
real
property
ownership.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
in
the--
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
--yes,
your
honor.
in
addition,
have
suggested
in
my
brief
that
the
process
of
purchasing
a
home,
since
home
ownership
is
probably
what
the
people
presumed,
is
an
educational
process
in
that
the
person
who
purchases
a
home
learns
about
real
property
values
and
the
value
of
various
amenities
in
the
area,
and
the
costs
of
these
services.
this
is
an
experience
that
somebody
who
has
not
gone
through...
an
experience
that
someone
who
has
not
gone
through
this
process
will
not
have
and
not
be
able
to
bring
to
bear.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
we
have...
in
the
case
of
turner
and
in
the
case
of
chappelle,
we
have
persons
who
are
being
asked
to
exercise
administrative
authority
rather
than,
as
in
this
case,
legislative
authority.
and
for
that
reason,
i
maintain
that
this
process
under
the
pacific
states
telephone
and
telegraph
case
does
not--
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
--i
think
that
in
such
a
case
we
would
run
afoul
of
the...
the
congress
or
the
executive,
perhaps,
on
a
guaranty
clause
question.
but,
no,
that
would
not
be
a
reviewable
controversy
in
this
court.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
the
court
does
not,
of
course,
cite
to
michigan
v.
long
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
the
state--
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
--i
am...
i
am
aware
of
that
doctrine.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
yes,
it
is.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
yes,
your
honor.
the
question,
though,
is,
given
this
record,
what
does
the
missouri
supreme
court
opinion
mean?
the
appellants
have
been
able
to
point
to
one
ambiguous
statement.
and,
on
the
other
hand,
i
can
point
to
several
clear
statements
throughout
the
record
that
say
that
it
consists
of
members,
it
consists
of
electors.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
i
cannot
point
to
a
statement
of
the
missouri
supreme
court
that
says
we
are
relying
on
this
to
the
exclusion
of
all
else.
i--
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
--yes--
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
--yes,
your
honor.
you're
absolutely
right.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
yes,
it
did.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
even
justice
blackmar?
for
what
it's
worth,
this
was
justice
donnelly's
last
opinion
on
the
missouri
supreme
court.
he
retired
immediately
after
writing
this
opinion.
as
a...
we
were
discussing
a
short
while
ago,
the
rational
basis
for
a
land
owner
requirement...
and
that
is,
in
addition
to
the
findings
of
the
trial
court
and
the...
the
rational
reason
to
have
a
homeowner
and
the
educational
experience
of
owning
a
home,
in
addition,
somebody
who
owns
real
property
within
the
district
is,
quite
frankly,
likely
to
stay
there
because
there
are
certain
transactional
costs
involved
with
selling
the
home
and
moving
elsewhere.
thus,
the...
a
home
owner
requirement
is
analogous
anyway,
to
a
prospective
residency
requirement
in
that
somebody
who
is
likely
to
stay
in
a
particular
jurisdiction
is
more
likely
to
be
careful
about
structuring
the
government
that
he
is
going
to
live
under,
than
somebody
who
is
free
to
pick
up
and
move
in
the
near
future.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
no,
your
honor.
this
would...
this
would
have
to
be
remanded.
alternatively...
rather
than
remanding
it...
bear
in
mind
that
what
the
state
and
the
governments
would
like
in
this
case
is
to
have
the
appeal
dismissed.
but
what
we
are
after
in
this
case
is
an
election.
we
want
to
let
the
people
of
metropolitan
st.
louis
vote
and
determine
the
kind
of
government
under
which
they
will
live,
alternatively--
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
--pardon
me.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
yes.
after
this
opinion...
or,
this
appeal...
was
taken
to
this
court,
one
of
the
members
of
the
board
of
freeholders
obtained
an
order
precluding
the
election
in
the
city
and
county--
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
--no.
there
is
a
court
order
enjoining
the
election.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
from
the...
i
believe
it's
the--
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
--st.
louis...
it's
a
state
court.
a
trial
court
in
st.
louis.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
i
am
proposing
this
as
an
idea
that
might
have
occurred
to
the
electorate
at
the
time
it
adopted
this.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
i'm
saying
that
there
is
a
rational
basis
for
believing
that.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
in
1924.
sixty-five
years.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
for
electors?
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
no,
your
honor.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
as
the
appellants
have
cited,
for
other
provisions
of
the
constitution,
and
notably
the
one
in
article
i,
it
has
been
defined
to
be
an
owner
of
real
property.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
yes,
your
honor.
as
i
had--
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
--it's
a
plain
obvious
reading
of
the
constitution
that
these
people
are
required
to
be
electors
of
various
districts.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
the...
we
were
discussing
quite
a
while
ago
the
meaning
of
the
word
"judge".
sometimes
it
means
one
who
sits
on
a
case.
on
election
day,
it
means
someone
who
supervises
a
polling
place.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
but
a
board
of
judges
at
a
racetrack
refers
to
people
who
supervise
stewards
rather
than--
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
--people
who--
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
--but,
the
point
is
we
use
judge...
the
word
"judge"
to
mean
different
things
in
different
contexts.
and
in
the
context
of
section--
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
--it
is...
in
this
particular
section
it
is
only
a
name
given
to
a
group
of
people
who
serve
on
a
particular
board.
these
people,
when
we
talk
about
appointment
and
qualifications
in
section
30(a)--
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
--so
the
trial
court
found.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
when
using
this
word
in
a
public
law
context,
as
found
by
the
trial
court,
yes,
that
is,
at
this
point,
the
law
of
missouri.
when--
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
--i
am
not
aware
that
our
office
has--
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
--in
the
trial
court
and
in
the
supreme
court,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
we
have
not
issued
any--
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
--there
is
a
second
case
that
was
pending
at
about
the
same
time
in
st.
louis
county
where
we
did
take
that
position.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
that
is
true.
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
the
governor
is
the
former
attorney
general
and
did
not
ask
for
our
advice
on
this
question.
[laughter]
mr.
simon
b.
buckner
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
ask
this
court
to
dismiss
the
appeal.
thank
you
very
much.
