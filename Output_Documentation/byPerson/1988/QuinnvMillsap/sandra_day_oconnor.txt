mr.
o'keefe,
how
far
does
your
theory
go?
the
board
does
deal
with
things
like
recommendations
on
property
taxes,
i
gather,
and
formation
of
sewer
districts,
and
property
boundaries
of
one
kind
or
another.
do
you
suppose
it
would
be
possible,
because
property
owners
are
particularly
affected,
to
have
a
board
in
which
some
of
the
members
have
to
be
property
owners?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
understand
that.
that's
not
my
question.
justice
sandra

o'connor
well,
i'm
asking
whether
it
would
be
permissible
under
the
constitution,
in
your
view,
for
a
state
to
set
it
up
with
certain
members
having
to
be
property
owners...
maybe
so
many
civil
engineers,
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
can
the
state
do
that?

their
duties
impact
heavily
on
property
ownership?
justice
sandra

o'connor
mr.
o'keefe,
do
we
apply
just
a
rationality
standard?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
think
turner
was
a
typical
application
of
a
rationality
test?
or,
did
it
look
like
something
else?
