mr.
rosen,
tell
me
how
those
two
work
together.
does
the
attorney
get
both
fees?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
understand
all
that.
but
i
want
to
know
what
the,
what
the
attorney
gets
out
of
the
winning
case.
does
he
get
both
fees?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
that
the
contingent
fee
then,
arrangement,
really
means
nothing?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
then
you
think
the
court
would
fix
the
reasonable
fee
loss
the
contingent
fee?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
understand
all
that.
but
i
can
also
sense
a
lot
of
attorneys
taking
both
fees.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i'm
wondering
really
why,
in
a
case
that
is
subject
to
1988,
a
contingent
fee
arrangement
is
at
all
necessary
or
indeed
indicated.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
know
exactly
how
it
happens.
you
don't
have
to
tell
me
that.
but
i
want
to
know
where--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--well,
that's
a
little
high,
after
my
old
practice
days
anyway.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
course,
in
my
day,
we
didn't
charge
for
paralegals
either.
and
now
apparently
they
do.
so
maybe
ten
years
hence
paper
clips
will
be
charged
for.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
anything
to
increase
it.
