you
think
1988
was
intended
to
reduce
the
contractual
entitlement
of
the
lawyer?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
here
you
have
a
lawyer
who
struck
a
deal
for,
you
know,
to
get
$100,000,
and
you're
telling
me
1988
was
meant
to
somehow
interfere
with
that
contractual
agreement?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
fine.
but
which
one
trumps?
why
doesn't
he
get
$100,000?
that's
all
that
i
don't
understand.
why
doesn't
he--
justice
antonin
scalia
actually,
they're
a
paraprofession,
aren't
they,
they're
not
really
a
profession?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
you
asked
your
brother-in-law
to
go
out?
he
happened
to
be
passing
by
that
way
and
you
asked
him
to
talk
to
this
witness,
just
to
find
out
if
this
witness
saw
anything.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
well,
you
offer
him
50
bucks
if
he'll
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's,
that's
the
line,
you
can't
bill
it
because
he's
not
a
paraprofessional?
justice
antonin
scalia
whereupon
you'd
have
to
reopen
the
judgment
to
give
that
excess
too,
i,
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
lawyer
never
gets
anything.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
did
it
prove
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
clear
goes...
once
you
concede
that
you
concede
the
purpose
of
the
act
is,
goes
beyond
making
the
plaintiff
whole,
once
you
concede
that.
i
mean,
in
that
case
you
don't
have
to
give
the
plaintiff
a
penny
in
order
to
make
the
plaintiff
whole.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
an
easy
question,
if
we
agree
with
you
that
the
agreed-upon
contingency
fee
is
the
limit.
obviously
when
a
lawyer
agrees
on
a
contingency
fee
that's
all
he's
supposed
to
get.
but
suppose
we
disagree
with
you
that
that's
a
limit
of
the
award,
and
we
think
you
can,
the
court
can
give
an
award
beyond
the
contractual
limit,
would
you
think
the
court
could
allow
paralegal
time
in
that
award?
