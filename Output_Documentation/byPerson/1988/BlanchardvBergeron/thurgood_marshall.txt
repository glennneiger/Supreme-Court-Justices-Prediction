justice
thurgood
marshall
the
state
court
too?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
that's
not
my
point.
my
point
is
you
get
the
$75,000
from
the
federal
side,
and
you'd
come
back
to
the
client
and
say,
i
also
have
one
with
you
for
$40,000.
does
the
state
court
enforce
that
$40,000
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
in
the
contract,
if
i
win,
if
i
win
i
will
give
you
40
percent
of
what
i
make.
and
not...
the
one
two
words
that
are
not
in
that
contract
are
civil
rights.
would
that
be
enforceable
after
you
collect
the
federal
money?
yes
or
no.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
state
court
couldn't
enforce
a
state
contract?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
can
get
disputes
as
to
what's
reasonable
fee.
i've
seen
it
run
as
high
as
70
percent,
which
i
didn't
think
was
reasonable,
but
i
found
people
did
think
it
was.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
talking
about
louisiana.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
charge
for
lexis
and
westlaw?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
louisiana
do
they
usually
charge
for
that
as
a
separate
item?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
all
that
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
you've
just
said,
that
the
custom
of
billing
and
all
in
new
orleans,
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
think?
didn't
you
try
the
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
you
should
have
used
a
paralegal.
