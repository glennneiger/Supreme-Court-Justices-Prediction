justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about...
just
following
up
really
on
justice
blackmun's
question...
supposing
you
had
not
appealed,
just
received
the
$7,500
fee,
and
putting
the
costs
to
one
side
for
a
moment.
is
it
your
understanding
that
$4,000
of
that
$7,500
would
have
gone
to
the
client
and
you
would
have
kept
$3,500?
or
would
it
have
all
gone
to
you,
or
all
to
the
client?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
if
the
client
had
paid
you
the...
say
they
had
paid
the
principal
judgment
right
away
while
the
fees
were
being
debated,
$10,000
would
have
been
paid
to
the
client,
the
client
would
have
paid
you
$4,000
as
the
40
percent
contingent
fees
then
if
thereafter
$7,500
was
recovered
$4,000
would
go
to
the
client
and
$3,500
would
go
to
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
rosen,
the
hypothesis
is
that
after
taking
into
all,
account
all
of
those
factors
the
judge
concludes
that
$50,000
is
a
reasonable
fee.
then
the
question
is
if
you
have
a
contractual
right
to
another
$25,000
can
you
enforce
the
contract?
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
a
private
contractual
arrangement
in
the
civil
rights
area
for
a
higher
fee
would
be
unenforceable
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no.
all
these
enhancement
factors
have
been
taken
into
account
in
determining
the
court-awarded
reasonable
fee
of
$50,000.
you're
saying,
as
i
understand
you,
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
precludes
an
additional
fee,
even
though
the
parties
had
contracted
for
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
your
understanding
then
is
in
this
case,
when
$7,500
was
awarded,
the
client
didn't
just
keep
$4,000,
he
would
keep
the
whole
$7,500
and
the
lawyer
would
only
get
$4,000.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
two
disagree
on
the
meaning
of
this
judgment,
if
it
had
just...
it
says
the
plaintiff
gets
the
money.
that's
what
the
judgment
says.
the
plaintiff
shall
recover
the
reasonable
attorney's
fee
of
$7,500.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
actually,
i
suppose
if
you
read
the
contract
literally,
they'd
be
entitled
to,
the
lawyer
would
be
entitled
to
40
percent
of
the
excess,
because
the
recovery
included
$10,000
plus
$7,500,
so
his
40
percent
ought
to
be
on
the
total
$17,500.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
the
judgment
is
for
$17,500.
put
the
two
together
and
it's
a
matter
of
private
contract,
he
has
to
pay
his
debt
of
40
percent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
excuse
me.
can
i
ask
how
your
theory
works
to
the
case
where
there
is
no
agreed
contractual
price?
let's
assume
the
law
firm
is
a
public
interest
law
firm,
it's
provided
its
services
for
free.
you've
just
said
that
any
reasonable
attorney's
fees
awarded
go
to
the
plaintiff.
so
i
assume
you
would
say
that
in
that
case,
what,
either
no
fees
are
awarded
at
all
or
else
the
plaintiff
gets
reasonable
attorney's
fees,
and
if
he
does
he
can
keep
them.
