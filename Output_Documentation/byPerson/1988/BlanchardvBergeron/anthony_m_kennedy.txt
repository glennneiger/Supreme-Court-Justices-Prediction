justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
would
happen
if
an
attorney
spent
just
a
small
number
of
hours
on
a
case
and
received
a
huge
award,
and
he
had
a
contingent
fee
contract?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and,
and
suppose
that
we'd
all
stipulate
that
a
reasonable
fee
would
be
$20,000
but
his
contingent
fee
was
$100,000,
what
happens
then?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
suppose
the,
suppose
the
trial
court
said
a
reasonable
fee
here
is
$20,000,
but
the
judgment
was
huge,
and
under
the
contingent
fee
contract
the
fee
award
under
the
contingent
contract
was
$100,000?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
is.
but
does
the
attorney
get
to
keep
the
$100,000
enforcing
his
contract
against
the
client?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
mean
the
contingency
fee
contract
is
just,
is
just
invalidated?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
the
supremacy
clause
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
a
private
contract.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
contract
didn't
provide
for
that,
did
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
contract
didn't
provide
for
that,
did
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
client
was
liable?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
we
are
going
beyond
the
contingent
fee
contract
in
order
to
reach
the
result
that
you
explained
to
mr.
justice
white?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you're
arguing
that
the
court
is
limited
and
fixed
by
the
terms
of
the
contract.
in
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
white
you've
just
indicated
that
you
can
go
beyond
the
contract
by
at
least
the
contract
amount.
