you're
going
to
add
the
secretarial
time,
paper,
paper
clips?
justice

electricity?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you,
are
you
suggesting
that
if
the
fee
is
limited
to
$4,000
in
this
case,
that
it
must
come
out
of
their
damages?
are
you
saying
the
defendant
doesn't
have
to
pay
any
fee?
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
so
that
the
plaintiff
is
coming
out
better
than
his
contingent
contract--
justice
byron
r.
white
--yes.
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
then
should
the
defendant
have
to
pay
anything?
if
the
plaintiff
was
perfectly
capable
of
getting
a
lawyer
in
the
marketplace,
on
ordinary
terms,
the
purpose
of
the
statute
isn't
triggered
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
have
you
been
involved
in
other
litigation
like
this?
in
1983
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
wondered
that
the
practice
was.
are
fees
awarded
paid
to
the
plaintiff,
or
to
his
lawyer?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
district
court
says,
the
statute
means
what
it
says,
i
must
award
a
reasonable
attorney's
fees
to
the
plaintiff,
and
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
in
this
case
is
$10,000,
and
he
says,
pay
it
to
the
plaintiff,
and
it's
paid
to
the
plaintiff,
do
you
suppose
the
plaintiff
could
then
say
to
his
lawyer,
sorry,
i'm
only
going
to
pay
you
$4,000?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
this
case
too.
that's
this
case.
i
would
think
you
would
be
disagreeing
then
with
the
court
of
appeals,
in
a
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
one
of
these
cases
is
from
the
fifth
circuit,
blanchard
against
bergeron.
for
the
reasons
stated
in
the
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
