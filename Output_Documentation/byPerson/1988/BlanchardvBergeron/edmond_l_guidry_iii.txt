mr.
edmond
l.
guidry,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case
properly
decided
to
limit
the
recovery
of
attorney's
fees
to
the
amount
which
the
appellant
had
contracted
with
his
attorney
to
receive.
any
recovery
in
excess
of
this
amount,
of
this
amount,
would
provide
a
windfall
either
to
the
appellant
or
to
his
attorney.
the
civil
rights
attorney's
fees--
mr.
edmond
l.
guidry,
iii
--no.
i
think
that
the
defendant
does
have
to
pay
in
addition
$4,000
in
attorney's
fees.
mr.
edmond
l.
guidry,
iii
certainly.
his
obligation
to
his
attorney
would
be
fulfilled
by
the
defendant's
payment
of
attorney's
fees
and
he
would
receive
the
entirety
of
his
judgment.
mr.
edmond
l.
guidry,
iii
the
civil
rights--
mr.
edmond
l.
guidry,
iii
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
edmond
l.
guidry,
iii
the
contract
simply
provided
for
attorney's
fees
and
40
percent
of
the
amount
of
the
recovery.
mr.
edmond
l.
guidry,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
edmond
l.
guidry,
iii
in
fact
you
are
not,
because
if
the
payment
of
attorney's
fees
under
the
statute,
as
the
statute
indicates,
is
made
payable
to
the
plaintiff,
then
the
plaintiff
simply
under
his
attorney's
fees
contract
would
then
turn
over
the
funds,
$4,000,
to
his
attorney
and
his
obligation
would
be
completed.
mr.
edmond
l.
guidry,
iii
the
attorney's
fees
are
set
by,
by
the
court,
is
what
they
are
awarded.
they
are
merely
limited
by
the
contract
because
he
had
a
contract
providing
for,
for
a
proportion
of
the
recovery.
the
civil
rights
attorney's
fees
award
act
is
a
mechanism
that
was
designed
by
congress
to
provide
representation
in
civil
rights
cases
to
less
fortunate
by
shifting
the
burden
of,
the
economic
burden
of
prosecution
from
the
victim
to
the
violator.
simply
we
must
look
here
that
what
congress
intended
to
do,
and
their
purpose
in
passing
the
civil
rights
attorney's
fees
award
act,
was
to
provide
counsel
for
people
who
were
less
fortunate
yet
had
their
civil
rights
violated.
in
this
case,
mr.
blanchard
was
able
to
obtain
counsel
by
signing
a
contingency
fee
contract
for
40
percent
of
the
recovery.
congress'
purpose
was
fulfilled.
mr.
edmond
l.
guidry,
iii
because
the
statute
provides
that
the
court
may
award
attorney's
fees
if
a
prevailing
party
is
successful
in
a
civil
rights
action.
while
congress
fully
intended
to
make
the
representation
of
the
less
fortunate
attractive,
they
certainly
did
not
intend
to
provide
windfalls
either
to
the
plaintiffs
or
to
their
counsel.
a
decision
in
this
case
not
to
allow
a
recovery
in
excess
of
the
contract
amount
would
not
act
as
a
disincentive
in
the
future
to
attorneys
handling
civil
rights
cases
under
different
contractual
bases.
in
a
recent
case
decided
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
hernandez
versus
hill
country
telephone
cooperative,
inc.,
the
fifth
circuit
approved
a
contingency
fee
agreement
which
was
entered
into
between
a
counsel
and
his
client
where
the
attorney
would
receive
50
percent
of
the
recovery
if
he
was
successful
and
no
attorney's
fees
were
awarded.
in
the
event
that
attorney's
fees
were
awarded
but
less
than
50
percent
of
the
amount
of
the
recovery,
then
the
plaintiff
would
make
up
the
difference
in
the
attorney's
fees.
if
the
plaintiff,
if
the
plaintiff's
counsel
received
attorney's
fees
in
excess
of
50
percent
of
the
amount
of
the
recovery,
then
the
attorney
would
receive
the
court-awarded
fees
and
the
plaintiff
would
receive
the
entirely
of
his
judgment.
although
the
court
was
not
excited
about
the
percentage
charged
by
the
attorney,
they
said
that
the
contract
was
not
proscribred
either
by
johnson
v.
georgia
highway
express
or
other
of
that
court's
precedents
and
also
that
the
attorney's
fees
agreement
was
not
unreasonable.
mr.
edmond
l.
guidry,
iii
no,
i
have
not,
your
honor.
mr.
edmond
l.
guidry,
iii
in
all
of
the
research
that
i
have
done,
i
have
not
found
any,
any
statutory
or
jurisprudence
that
indicates
that
it
should
be
paid
to
one
or
the
other.
mr.
edmond
l.
guidry,
iii
i
think
that
he
could
say
that
if
he
had
a
contingency
fee
contract
that
provided
for
an
amount
different
than
the
amount
awarded
by
the
court.
and
that's
the
problem
in
this
case.
mr.
edmond
l.
guidry,
iii
i
think
that's
exactly
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
this
case.
it
was
my
understanding
of
the
decision.
mr.
edmond
l.
guidry,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
edmond
l.
guidry,
iii
the
judgment
says
that,
the
statute
says
the
prevailing
party,
and
then
the
legislative
history
to
the
civil
rights
attorney's
fees
award
act,
it
indicates
that,
you
know,
if
victims
are
to
be
able
to
pursue
their
civil
rights,
then
they
must
be
able
to
recover
what
it
costs
them
to--
mr.
edmond
l.
guidry,
iii
--depending
on
whether
the
contract
includes
recovery
of
attorney's
fees
also.
mr.
edmond
l.
guidry,
iii
certainly.
mr.
edmond
l.
guidry,
iii
that's
correct...
whether
or
not
it
would
be
covered
by
the
contract
i'm
not
certain.
by
limiting
the
recovery
of
attorney's
fees
in
this
case
neither
the
appellant
nor
congress'
intent
to
foster
the
enforcement
of
civil
rights
is
disserved.
the
appellant's
obligation
to
the
attorney
is
paid
and
he
received
a
favorable
judgment
without
any
cost
to
himself.
the
attorney
may
not
accept
another
civil
rights
case
under
a
contingency
fee
contract
providing
for
a
proportion
of
the
damages,
but
it
should
not
prevent
him
from
handling
other
civil
rights
cases
under
different
contractual
bases.
the
fifth
circuit
in
blanchard
does
not
conflict
with
this
court's
decision
in
city
of
riverside
v.
rivera,
as
had
been
claimed
by
the
appellant.
mr.
edmond
l.
guidry,
iii
i
think--
mr.
edmond
l.
guidry,
iii
--in
the
case
of
pro
bono
work
and
in
the
case
of
public
service
legal
corporations,
that
congress
by
approving
the
method
of
payment
in
stanford
daly
and
in
the
davis
case,
which
was
cited
in
the
history--
mr.
edmond
l.
guidry,
iii
--in
the
legislative
history--
mr.
edmond
l.
guidry,
iii
--to
the
civil
rights
attorney's
fees
award
act,
congress
cited
those
two
cases
as
being
cases
where
proper
awards
were
made,
one
of
which
was
to
a,
in
pro
bono
work,
the
other
was
to
a
non-profit
public
service
legal
corporation.
and
by
approving
both
of
those
cases,
we
can
assume
that
congress
intended
that
they
receive
attorney's
fees
for
their
work,
even
though
they
may
be
prevented
from
entering
into
a
contract
with
the
plaintiff
to
receive
fees.
mr.
edmond
l.
guidry,
iii
certainly
you
have
to
give,
you
have
to
make,
to
make
the
plaintiff
whole
you
still
have
to
provide
these
funds,
because
without
these
funds
these
public
service
corporations
would
not
be
able
to
represent
plaintiff.
so
in
that
respect
it
makes
representation
available
to
less
fortunate
citizens.
as
the
fifth
circuit
noted
in
its
case,
if
plaintiffs
such
as
arthur
blanchard
are
able
to
obtain
counsel
to
represent
them
under
a
contingency
fee
arrangement
providing
for
payment
of
attorney's
fees
based
on
a
proportion
of
the
recovery,
then
in
those
cases
the
attorney
cannot
be
said
to
have
relied
upon
the
statutory
assurance
that
he
would
receive
any
other
fee
than
that
provided
in
the
contract.
certainly
i
can
tell
the
court
that
when
a
client
comes
into
my
office,
before
i
accept
the
case
on
any
fee
basis,
i
know
what
the
case
is
about,
and
i
know
what
fee
i
will
charge
for
a
particular
type
case.
certainly
the
more
risky
the
case
the
larger
the
percentage
of
attorney's
fees
which
would
be
charged.
mr.
edmond
l.
guidry,
iii
certainly
i
think
that
is
true,
but
you
certainly
know
what
you
feel
is
the
chance
of,
of
being
successful
and
what
type
of
action
you
are
faced
with
before
you
agree
to
accept
the
case.
mr.
edmond
l.
guidry,
iii
one
may
not
know
from
the
start
whether
or
not
it
is
a
1983
case,
but
you
would
not
accept
the
case
until
you
determined
what
type
of
case
you
were
faced
with.
mr.
edmond
l.
guidry,
iii
i
would
not
accept
it
unless
i
knew
what
type
of
case
i
was--
mr.
edmond
l.
guidry,
iii
--well,
certainly
they
are,
they
are...
i
don't
do
any
sherman
anti-trust
work.
so
if
a
client
came
into
my
office
and
presented
me
with
facts
which
i
was
not
sure
what
type
of
case,
or
what
law
i
would
be
faced
with,
i
would
certainly
research
that
prior
to
agreeing
to
accept
the
case.
mr.
edmond
l.
guidry,
iii
that
may
be
true
in
other
cases.
in
this
case
i
don't
think
that
was
true,
because
the
facts
of
this
case
were
that
the
plaintiff
alleged
that
his
jaw
was
broken
by
an
on-duty
police
officer
in
uniform.
mr.
edmond
l.
guidry,
iii
certainly
to
the
extent
that
fee
awards
are
intended
to
reflect
fees
charged
in
the
marketplace
for
legal
services,
enforcement
of
the
contract
in
this
particular
case
is
appropriate.
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
the
time
billed
by
law
clerks
is
necessarily
included
in
the
contingency
fee
contract.
the
contract
does
not
provide
for
the
additional
payment
for
legal
support
staff,
whether
it
be
law
clerks
or
paralegals.
the
attorney
under
the
contingency
fee
contract
is
paid
attorney's
fees
in
the
amount
of
40
percent
of
the
amount
recovered.
there
was
no
evidence
presented
at
trial
that
there
was
any
agreement
to
the
contrary,
or
that
there
was
any
other
provision
of
the
contract
which
would
require
the
payment
of
paralegals
and
law
clerks,
in
addition
to
the
contingency
fee
amount.
mr.
edmond
l.
guidry,
iii
i
think
that
the
court
can
award
paralegal
time
in
certain
circumstances.
the
case
presented
before
this
court
is
that
the...
rather
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
is
that
the
paralegal
award
is
included
within
the
contingency
fee.
the
district
court
in
this
very
case
found
that
paralegal
and
law
clerk
time
was
not
necessary,
that
the
simplicity
of
this
case
prevented
it.
so
whether
or
not
paralegal
time,
it
may
be
recoverable
under
different
circumstances
is
something
that
is
not
before
the
court
at
this
time.
certainly
if
there
was
evidence
presented
at
the
trial
that
the
cost
of
paralegals
and
law
clerks
is
paid
or
billed
to
clients
in
that
particular
marketplace
as
an
addition
to
the
fee
charged
by
the
attorney,
then
i
would
say
yes,
it
would
be
recoverable
under
1988.
any
recovery
of
fees
in
excess
of
the
amount
contracted,
including
paralegal
and
law
clerk
time,
would
provide
a
windfall
to
the
plaintiff's
attorney,
in
derogation
of
congress'
purpose
in
passing
the
civil
rights
attorney's
fees
award
act.
the
fifth
circuit
decision
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
