mr.
william
w.
rosen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
blanchard
police
brutality
case
presents
two
issues.
the
first
is
whether
a
contingent
fee
contract
forms
a
cap
on
section
1988
reasonable
fees,
and
the
second
is
whether
paraprofessional
time
should
be
included
within
the
auspices
of
section
1988.
i
came
to
this
case
after
it
had
already
been
filed.
a
fellow
attorney
became
ill
and
asked
me
to
take
it
over.
i
reviewed
it,
decided
that
it
had
merit,
and
after
that
asked
him
what
sort
of
fee
arrangement
he
had.
he
told
me
he
had
a
40
percent
contingent
fee
contract
with
mr.
blanchard,
but
that
if
i
won,
or
the
case
was
won,
there
would
be
fees
under
the
civil
rights
attorney's
fee
award
act.
mr.
william
w.
rosen
no,
sir.
i
think
you've
got
to
then
look
at
what
is
meant.
for
example,
i
would
say
99
percent
of
all
negligence
cases
that
are
taken
in
the
united
states
are
taken
when
the
client
comes
in,
a
contingent
fee
contract
is
accepted
on
that
sort
of
basis.
but
section
1988
applies
to
the
end
of
the
case,
and
is
not
a
relationship
with
the
client,
it
is
the
implementation
of
fees
against
a
losing
party
who
has
violated
a
civil
rights.
mr.
william
w.
rosen
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
he
gets
a
reasonable
fee
as
determined
by
the
court,
after
review
of
the
loadstar
method.
now--
mr.
william
w.
rosen
--it
is
in,
for
general
purposes,
i
think,
irrelevant
as
to
the
implementation
of
1988
fees.
may
it
be
a
consideration
for
enhancement
for
the
value
of
the
vindication
of
a
right,
over
and
above
what
the
court
may
think
is
a
satisfactory
fee
on
an
hourly
basis
times
hour...
hourly
amount,
a
fee,
time
number
of
hours,
loadstar.
mr.
william
w.
rosen
justice
blackmun,
i
don't
think
that
the
contingent
fee
per
se
is
a
consideration.
i
think
it
is
irrelevant
in
the,
in
the
implementation
of
1988.
i
do
not
think
that
it
is,
it
is
a
relevant
factor,
because
it
is
the
private
agreement
between
a
client
and
an
attorney,
whereas
the
implementation
of
1988
comes
at
the
end
after
all
of
the
work
has
been
done
and
congress,
the
intent
of
congress,
as
i
understand
it
from
the
cases,
are
that
this
is
part
of
the
vindication
of
the
civil
right.
mr.
william
w.
rosen
if
1988
is
implemented
correctly,
i
do
not
think
that
both
fees
probably
are
necessary
or
probably
should
be
taken.
i
think
then
you
may
get
into
the
possibility
of
consideration
of
windfall,
but
i
don't
think
that's...
i
think
it's
a
consideration
but
i
think
the
reasonable
fee
as
instituted,
as
required
by
1988,
is
the
primary
consideration,
and
that
primary
consideration
is
loadstar.
mr.
william
w.
rosen
i
think
the
reason
for
that,
justice
blackmun,
is
this.
a
client
walks
into
an
attorney's
office
and
says,
i
have--
mr.
william
w.
rosen
--he
may
not
know...
the
attorney
may
not
know
what
he
has.
he
may
not
be
aware
that
it
involves
a
civil
right
violation
when
someone
comes
into
his
office.
therefore,
if
it
involves
a
negligence
type
of
situation,
the
standard
agreement,
as
i
say
i
think
probably
99
percent
or
more--
mr.
william
w.
rosen
--and
i
think,
sir,
that
the,
that
the
standard
before
you
even
know
what
the
investigation
will
show
as
to
what
kind
of
case
you
have,
is
a
contingent
fee
contract.
now,
basically
what
the
fifth
circuit
said
to
me
was
that,
mr.
rosen,
you
didn't
take,
you
didn't
adjust
the
contract,
which
was
not
mine
to
begin
with,
but
you
did
not
go
back
and
adjust
the
contract
to
say,
i'll
take
the
higher
of
the
1988
or
contingent
fee
or
whatever
it
was
that
should
be
adjusted.
what
the
fifth
circuit
says,
next
time
you'll
know
better.
that's
precisely
what
they
said
in
their
opinion.
i
just
don't
think
that's
the
correct
application
of
1988.
mr.
william
w.
rosen
yes
sir,
over,
over
and...
yes.
it
is
a
fee
on
top
of
the
actual
damage
portion.
mr.
william
w.
rosen
otherwise
it
would
be,
it
would
certainly
be
a
windfall
to
the
defendant.
mr.
william
w.
rosen
the
defendant
would
have
to
pay
$14,000...
well,
i
hope
that
is
what
the
fifth
circuit
said.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
cannot
tell
from
reading
the
fifth
circuit
opinion
whether
that
is
actually
what
they
meant.
i
would
certainly
hope
that's
what
they
meant,
but
they
don't
say
that
the
defendants
shall
pay
this
additional
amount,
or
that
it
shall
come
out
of
mr.
blanchard's
portion.
i
certainly
hope
it's
the
former
of
those,
and
i
think
that
clearly
is
the
intent
of
this
court
and
the
intent
of
congress
to
do
that.
mr.
william
w.
rosen
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
w.
rosen
i
appealed
from
that
on
two
bases--
mr.
william
w.
rosen
--well,
the
first
in
the
appeal
to
the
fifth
circuit,
the
paraprofessional
issue,
was
included
within
the
whole
attorney
fee
issue.
but
the
second
part,
which
i
did
not
bring
to
this
court,
was
the
law
court
awarded
me
out
of
some
$5,000
out-of-pocket
expenses
of
my
own
on
the
case,
they
awarded
me
about
$800.
the
fifth
circuit
reimbursed
me
almost
the
whole
$5,000
approximately,
so
i
did
not
bring
that
issue
to
this
court.
the
issue
here
involves
the
cap
issue,
and
obviously
i
cannot
win
on
the
paraprofessional
issue
unless
you
reverse
on
the
cap
issue.
mr.
william
w.
rosen
justice
stevens,
as
a
practical
matter,
i
have
received
no
fee
at
the
present
time.
so
that
in
answer
to
your
question,
my
understanding
is
that
i
would
have
received
$7,500
from
the
defendant.
and
the
client
would
get
the
entire
$10,000--
mr.
william
w.
rosen
--which
had
been
awarded,
and
i
hope
and
i
think
that's
the
way
the
process
should
work.
mr.
william
w.
rosen
i
think
that's
the
way
the
system
should
work.
that's,
that's
my
opinion,
because
certainly
it
would
be
hoped,
under
the
intent
of
congress,
under
the
civil
rights
statute,
what
if
a
judge
or
a
jury
declares
that
mr.
blanchard
in
this
case
was
damaged
to
the
degree
of
$5,000
compensatory
and
$5,000
punitive
damages,
it
seems
to
me
when
you
have
the
civil
rights
attorney's
fee
award
act,
that
the
reasonable
compensation
of
the
attorney
should
be
based
on
that,
and
the
person
who
has
had
his
rights
damaged
should
then
get
whatever
the
judge
or
jury
has
awarded.
mr.
william
w.
rosen
justice
kennedy,
you
mean
a
huge
award
under
the
contingent
fee?
mr.
william
w.
rosen
under
the
contingent
fee--
mr.
william
w.
rosen
--i
think
then
you
get
into
the
area
of
whether
or
not
the
vindication
of
the
particular
right
was
worthy
of
an
enhancement
and
at
that
period
of
time,
at
that
time,
then
it
is
a
question
of
looking
at
what
is
the
relationship
and
what
does
the
contract
call
for.
it
may
well--
mr.
william
w.
rosen
--it
may
well
be
that
a
reasonable
fee
then
would
be
$20,000,
in
your
example,
$20,000.
mr.
william
w.
rosen
i
don't
think
that
the
attorney
keeps
the
$100,000,
except--
mr.
william
w.
rosen
--except
to
the
degree
for
1988
purposes,
except
to
the
degree
of
the
value
of
the
enhancement
of
the
right,
of
the
enforcement
of
the
right--
mr.
william
w.
rosen
--i
think--
mr.
william
w.
rosen
--i
think
there
are
two
different
issues.
i
think
the
issue
of
the
private
contractual
relationship
between
the
attorney
and
client
is
one
controlled
by
private
law
of
contract
and
state
law.
i
think
the
1988
issue...
and
that
comes
into
play
as
i've
mentioned
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
relationship.
at
the
end,
1988
comes
into
play
at
the
end.
mr.
william
w.
rosen
clearly,
from
the
basis
of
a
civil
right
litigation,
1988
does,
under
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution.
and
this
court
basically
has
said
that
in--
mr.
william
w.
rosen
--no,
sir.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
a
private
contract.
for
example,
suppose
in
the
court's
wisdom
i
got
$1
worth
of
fee.
would
i
feel
justified
in
the
hours
and
time
put
in
to
say
to
mr.
blanchard,
i
think
under
state
law
i
will
enforce
this
contract
for
$4,000?
i
think
i
would
be
justified.
now--
mr.
william
w.
rosen
--i
think
it
is
permissible.
i
think
that
the
question
is
always
in
the
civil
rights
area
the
reasonable
fee
under
1988.
mr.
william
w.
rosen
then
the
question--
mr.
william
w.
rosen
--mr.
chief
justice,
there
are
various
fee
arrangements--
mr.
william
w.
rosen
--the
court
may
uphold
that
fee
arrangement
if
they
find
it
reasonable.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
w.
rosen
i
think
the
fact
of
time
spent
on
the
case,
of
market
rate
of
billing
hours,
i
think
the
degree
of
success
in
the
vindication
of
the
civil
right.
somebody
can
certainly
handle
a
case
quicker
or
achieve
a
result
quicker
than
someone
else,
but
that
still
does
not
mean
that
a
fee
is
reduced.
so
there
are
a
number
of
factors
i
think
are
very
valid.
but
simply
to--
mr.
william
w.
rosen
--i
would
have
to
say
that,
if
the
court
said
a
reasonable
fee
was
$50,000,
then
under
that
civil...
if
the
only
issue
was
the
civil
rights
case--
mr.
william
w.
rosen
--then
i
think
that
$50,000
must
be
accepted
as
the
reasonable
fee.
mr.
william
w.
rosen
unless
there
was
an
enhancement
factor
that
the
court
looked
at.
mr.
william
w.
rosen
i
think
in
the
civil
rights
area
i
have
to
argue
that
is,
that
is
the
correct
fee,
if
the
court
says
it
is
the
correct
fee.
mr.
william
w.
rosen
i'm
not
sure
that
applies
to
the
state
court
too,
if
there
is
a
state,
if
there
is
a
state
issue
involved
in
it.
for
example,
the
court,
a
couple
of
recent
cases
that,
justice
marshall,
clearly
have
said
that
when
it
comes
to
a
civil
rights
case,
1983--
mr.
william
w.
rosen
--i
think
under
the
rulings
of
this
court
in
the
supremacy
area
that
the
federal
civil
rights
acts
are
supreme
to
that
issue
also.
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
understand
the
question,
but
i--
mr.
william
w.
rosen
--i
do
not
believe
it
would
be
enforceable
if
the
federal
court
had
determined
a
reasonable
fee.
mr.
william
w.
rosen
the
state
court
could
enforce
a
state
contract
were
it
not
for
the
holdings
of
this
court
in
the
area
of
supremacy
of
the
civil
rights
statute.
now,
that
my
be
talking
against
myself,
against
my
brother
lawyers,
but
i
think
a
reasonable
fee
is
a
reasonable
fee.
the
question
is,
have
i,
or
what
is
a
reasonable
fee
for
the
work
performed?
mr.
william
w.
rosen
well,
it's
clear
that
both
in
state
and
federal
law,
clear
certainly
in
louisiana
that
cases
go
back
to,
i
think,
1934--
mr.
william
w.
rosen
--that
if
i
took
a
70
percent
contingent
fee
contract
the
courts
are
going
to
review
it,
because
the
courts
have
final
jurisdiction
to
review
attorney's
fees.
if
i
took
$5,000
an
hour
as
a
fee,
contract,
even
if
submitted
to
by
the
client,
he
later
objected,
that
is
going
to
be
subject
to
court
jurisdiction
to
review.
so
it
is
going
to
be
a
subject
which
is
always,
the
final
arbiter
of
it
is
going
to
be
the
courts,
no
matter
what
court
it
is.
i
would
like
to
talk
briefly...
one
other
question,
one
other
issue
on
the,
on
the
cap,
and
that
is,
we
have
been
talking
about
fees
and
money
and
proportions.
but
we
are
really
talking
there
about
monetary
awards,
and
certainly
it
has
been
shown
and
held
by
many
courts
that
the
monetary
award
is
not
the
only
factor.
if
monetary
award
were
the
only
factor,
then
this
would
be
nothing
more
than
a
negligence
case.
the
other
factors
are
the
vindication
of
a
right.
and
that
is,
as
i
read
the
cases,
the
principal
issue,
because
many
civil
rights
awards
are
not
large,
monetarily,
and
certainly
some
ask
for
injunctive
relief.
so
there
would
be
no
fee
then,
if
you
had
a
contingent
fee
contract.
another
question
is,
do
i
get,
or
does
any
attorney
get
less
by
having
a
contingent
fee
contract
than
he
would
be
having
no
contract,
nothing
that
said
anything?
and
that
just
doesn't
seem
the
correct
application
of
1988.
the
second
issue
in
this
is
whether
paraprofessional
time
should
be
included
in
1988
fee,
fee
award.
it
certainly
is
to
be
included,
it
seems
to
me,
under
the
loadstar
calculation,
and
that
is
what
i
ask
the
court
to
do.
it
is
to
be
included
because
if
it
is
not
the
cost
of
legal
services
will
substantially
increase.
the
work
has
to
be
done,
the
attorney
has
to
do
the
work
or
have
the
work
performed,
so
that
the
work
performed
by
paraprofessionals,
law
clerks
and
paralegals,
done
under
the
supervision
of
an
attorney,
done
subject
to
his
responsibility
and
his
malpractice
insurance
responsibility,
seems
to
me
absolutely
valid
to
have
that
included--
mr.
william
w.
rosen
--no,
sir.
mr.
william
w.
rosen
no,
sir.
and
the
reason
why,
justice
white,
is
this.
part
of
it,
i
suppose,
is
tradition.
never
that
i
know
about
in
my
practice
has
secretarial
time
or
the
paper
clip
cost
of
overhead
been
included
as
a
billable
amount.
also--
mr.
william
w.
rosen
--well,
i,
i
don't
want
to
use
a
crystal
ball,
justice
blackmun,
but--
mr.
william
w.
rosen
--i
might
add
that
in,
since
i
have
been
practicing,
i
do
not
know
of
any
firm
that
does
not
charge
a
market
rate
to
its
clients
of
paralegals
and
law
clerk
time.
i
do
not
know
of
any
firm
that
simply
accepts
the
expense
of
those
services
as
simply
overhead.
there's
another
reason.
paraprofessionals
are
a
profession.
they
should
be
recognized
as
a
profession.
mr.
william
w.
rosen
absolutely--
mr.
william
w.
rosen
--they
are
trained,
they
have
a
course
of
study,
they
are
certified.
the
american
bar
association
has
a
system
of
certification
of
many
schools.
they
are
in
the
same
area
as,
for
example,
emergency
medical
technician.
they
require
special
training
in
order
to
perform
their
special
duties.
mr.
william
w.
rosen
my
opinion
is
they
are
much
more
akin
to
what
a
lawyer
performs
than
what
a
secretary
performs.
mr.
william
w.
rosen
i
think
there
is
a...
i
don't
personally
have
lexis
and
westlaw,
but
i
think
there
usually
is
a
charge
for--
mr.
william
w.
rosen
--i
think
that
is
charged
as
a
separate
item,
but
i
cannot
address
it
because
i
haven't
used
that.
mr.

paraprofession,
i
suppose,
is
correct.
they
are
certainly,
justice
scalia,
i
suppose
that
they
are,
in
my
opinion,
and
i've
been
involved
in
the
paralegal
area
for
more
than
ten
years
in
helping
to
organize
the
tulane
program,
and
have
taught
in
two
schools,
and
i
would
say
that
they
are
much
closer
to
a
profession
today
certainly
than
would
be
a
legal
secretary.
and
that's
the
reason
i
say
to
the
court,
they
should
be
recognized
as
such.
if
it
were
not
for
their
work,
attorneys
would
have
to
do
the
work.
the
contact
with
witnesses,
the
law
clerk
in
my
particular
case
accompanied
me
three
days
at
trial
and
was
a
great
help.
one
of
them
did
the
first
draft
of
the
fee
application
and
researched
the
law
on
it.
these
are
not
areas
that
a
legal
secretary
does.
these
are
areas
that
are
much
more
akin
to
what
a
lawyer
will
have
to
do.
mr.
william
w.
rosen
a
law
clerk.
mr.
william
w.
rosen
correct.
both...
there
were
two
at
various
times,
after
one
graduated
he
was
followed
by
another.
but
both
of
them
were
seniors
at
tulane
university
law
school.
mr.
william
w.
rosen
mr.
chief
justice,
my
opinion
is
that,
if
at
all
possible,
law
students
or
law
clerks
should
do
the
legal
research
and
paralegals,
legal
assistants,
should
do
the
factual
part.
are
paralegals
trained
to
do
legal
research?
yes,
they
are.
have
they
had
as
much
experience?
have
they
had
as
much
training
as
the,
someone
in
law
school
who's
a
senior
in
law
school?
no,
they
have
not.
so
in
the
way
i
approach
this
particular
case,
and
the
way
i've
used
both,
has
simply
been
that
the
primary
duty
of
research
is
the
law
clerk,
the
primary
duty
of
the
paraprofessional
is
the
contact
with
the
investigation,
the
witness
contact,
although
that
was
also--
mr.
william
w.
rosen
--yes,
sir.
mr.
william
w.
rosen
yes,
sir.
i
have
had
them
do
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact
i've--
mr.
william
w.
rosen
--it's
common
in
my
office,
mr.
chief
justice.
as
i
say,
i've
taught
the
legal
interviewing
course,
and
my
paralegal
on
this
particular
case
was
one
of
my
students.
so
i
had
no
question
with,
with
that
individual
talking
to
witnesses.
mr.
william
w.
rosen
is
he
a
member
of
my
staff,
justice
scalia?
is
he
a
hired
member
under
my
control
and
for
whom
i
am
responsible?
mr.
william
w.
rosen
i
don't...
i
would
not
consider
that
a
paraprofessional.
no,
sir.
mr.
william
w.
rosen
i
would
say
it
is
not
the
common
practice.
let
me
put
it
the
other
way.
it
is
the
common
practice
of
billing
market
rate
for
paralegals,
legal
assistants,
and
law
clerks.
it
is
not
the
common
practice,
that
i
know
about,
to
bill
the
rate
purely
of
somebody
you
hire
out
as
an
investigator,
as
a
subcontracted
event.
that
would
be
something
that
would
have
to
be
a
cost
but
not
a
market
rate
bill,
and
that--
mr.
william
w.
rosen
--i'm
sorry--
mr.
william
w.
rosen
--i'm
not--
mr.
william
w.
rosen
--i
think
it
is,
justice
marshall.
mr.
william
w.
rosen
i
tried
the
case,
but
whether
or
not
that
particular
item
is
in
the
record,
it
is
certainly
in
the
briefs,
but--
mr.
william
w.
rosen
--i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
the
time
at
the
end.
mr.
william
w.
rosen
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
try
to
put
to
rest
the
windfall
argument.
if
1988
is
correctly
applied
it
cannot
be
a
windfall.
they
are
mutually
exclusive.
you
can't
have
a
reasonable
fee
which
is
a
windfall,
at
least
as
i
see
it.
on
the
issue
of
what
effect
does
the
contingent
fee
contract
have,
the
contingent
fee
amount
in
a
contract
may
in
fact
be
a
reasonable
fee,
so
that
a
court
must
look,
may
want
to
look
at
the
contract,
and
the
amount
recovered,
and
may
say
that
this
is
reasonable,
and
therefore
one
becomes
the
other.
but
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
may
not
be
reasonable,
and
it
may
be
too,
it
may
be
too
little
or
it
may
be
too
less.
and
that
is
where
1988
comes
into
play.
the
fee
itself
belongs
to
the
attorney.
there's
a
1934
louisiana
supreme
court
case
on
it,
it
was
used
in
a
1982
louisiana
appellate
case,
in
1982.
as
to
the
allegations
that
this,
we
all
knew
that
an
on-duty
police
officer
broke
my
client's
jaw.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
that
wasn't
known
for
some...
the
allegations
were
in
the
petition.
the
question
was,
at
the
very
beginning,
whether
this
happened
in
a...
he
was
in
a
bar
room,
he
was
not
in
a
condition
to
know
exactly
who
it
was
who
hit
him,
as
i
understand
it,
at
the
very
beginning,
and
therefore
without
some
investigation
that
then
led
to
the
allegations
that
it
did
turn
out
in
fact
to
be
the
on-duty,
police
officer.
as
to
the
simplicity
of
the
case,
this
is
a
case
against
basically
the
only
law
officer
in
this
part
of
a
rural
louisiana
parish.
there
was
substantial
fear
that
i
found
in
contacting
potential
witnesses
against
testifying
against
this
police
officer.
i
was
faced
by
two
very
competent
counsel,
one
for
the
bar
and
mr.
guidry.
and
this
is
not,
i
don't
believe
there's
any
civil
rights
case
which
are
simple.
i
use
for
the
benefit
of
myself
and
my
client,
and
in
the
long
run
for
the
benefit,
as
it
turned
out,
for
the
defendant
the
use
of
paralegals
and
law
clerks.
their
time
is
compensable.
that
is
the
system
of
keeping
legal
costs
to
a
minimum.
they
were
very
important
in
this
case,
and
their
time
and
their
services
should
be
compensated.
and
they
should
be
compensated,
i
suggest--
