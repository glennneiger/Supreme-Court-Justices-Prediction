we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
87-1485,
arthur
blanchard
v.
james
bergeron.
mr.
rosen,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rosen,
do
you
read
the
fifth
circuit
opinion
as
saying
that
the
$4,000
attorney's
fee
is
payable
by
the
defendant
over
and
above
the
$5,000
actual
damages
and
the
$5,000
punitive
damages?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--yes.
so
the
defendant
will
have
to
pay
$14,000
under
the
fifth
circuit's
judgment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
district
court
awarded
you
$7,500
in
attorney's
fees.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
did
you
appeal
from
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
those
are
the
two
that
you
raise
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
that
a
client
walk
into
your
office
with
something
that
you,
being
a
knowledgable
lawyer,
know
is
a
civil
rights
case,
and
that
there
will
therefore
be
an
award
of
attorney's
fees
if
you
win,
and
you
tell
the
client,
i
think
we
can
get
a
judgment
for
$100,000
here
and
if
we
do
i
think
the
court
probably
is
going
to
award
another
$50,000
as
attorney's
fees.
my
arrangement
with
you
is,
i'm
going
to
take
half
of
whatever
the
court
awards,
both
as
damages
and
as
attorney's
fees.
so
if
we
get
$100,000
damages
and
$50,000
attorney's
fees
i
will
get
$75,000
and
you
will
get
$75,000.
do
you
think
that
is
a
permissible
arrangement?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--supposing
that
you're
an
attorney,
you've
negotiated
that
sort
of
an
arrangement,
you
come
to
the
court
and
you
say,
this
is
what
i
want
the
judgment
entered
for.
in
other
words,
is
the
court
going
to
uphold
that
kind
of
a
fee
arrangement?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i've
given
you
one
fee
arrangement.
will
you
answer
my
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
factors
would
they
take
into
consideration
in
deciding
whether
it
was
reasonable
or
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say
they're
a
profession?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
said
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say
they're
a
profession?
i
didn't
ask
you
if
you
would
repeat
yourself.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
are
their
duties
more
akin
to
what
a
lawyer
performs
or
more
akin
to
what
a
secretary
traditionally
performed?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
is
this
a
law
clerk
or
a
paralegal
that
you're
talking
about
who
drafted
the
first
application
for
the
fee?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
who
had,
who
is
in
law
school?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
now,
would
you
have
had
a
paralegal
possibly
draft
a
fee
application
like
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
does
the,
what
does
the
paraprofessional
do
when
they're
contacting
witnesses?
do
they
go
out
and
interview
the
witness?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
by
themselves?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
is
that
a
fairly
common
thing
for
them
to
do?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
rosen.
mr.
guidry,
we'll
hear
from
you
now.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
don't
always
know,
do
you,
mr.
guidry,
who
all
the
possible
defendants
are
until
you
do
some
investigation
or
have
someone
do
some
investigation
for
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
one
invariably
know
when
a
client
walks
in
the
door
saying
they've
sustained
some
sort
of
injury,
that
this
is
a
1983
case
or
this
is
not
a
1983
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
you
wouldn't
accept
it
until
you
could
tell
whether
or
not
it
was
a
1983
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
do
you
mean
by,
what
do
you
mean
by
the
words,
"what
type
of
case"?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
a
lawyer
who,
say,
specialized
in
plaintiff's
personal
injury
work
might
not
know
just
from
the
client's
original
recital
whether
or
not
there
might
be
some
sort
of
a
public
defendant
that
could
be
joined
that
would
make
it,
in
part,
a
1983
case
i
would
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
seems
pretty
clear.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
guidry.
mr.
rosen,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rosen.
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
white.
