justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
on
that?
of
course,
we
don't
have
a
statute
of
limitations
on
the
constitutional
claims.
but,
in
an
event,
supposing
you
had
a
case
like
this
in
which
you
did
not
know
in
1979
that
there
was
a
discriminatory
intent,
and
you
had
a
plan
that
worked
perfectly
equitably
for
20
years.
on
the
20th
year,
somebody
dug
up
some
did
files
and
found
out
that
the
union
president
and
the
company
president
really
had
a
very
invidious
intent
because
they...
the
documents
said,
we
don't
want
any
women
to
get
any
benefits;
in
an
way
we
can
design
this,
we
want
to
hurt
the
women.
but
they
were
stupid;
they
didn't
achieve
their
objective.
would
that...
could
they
recover
under
such
a
plan?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
i
mean,
the
mere
fact
that
there
was
an
intent
to
discriminate,
even
though
they
didn't
actually
discriminate
against
anyone--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
would
make
the
whole
plan--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i'm
just
saying
the
plan
worked
out
absolutely
equitably,
but
somewhere
down
the
line
a
female
had
the
plan
operate
against
her,
as
it
had
against
males
for
the
last
20
years.
and
she
says,
well,
i
know
this
plan
was
aimed
at
women;
ergo,
i
want
to
recover.
could
she?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
want
to
set
aside
the
whole
plan
now.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
such
as
in
this
case.
if
five
years
had
gone
by,
maybe
they
wouldn't
have
succeeded
in
their
invidious
intent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
woman
got
demoted
in
this
case.
that's
enough,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
understand
this
statement
that
goes
through
all
the
briefs
that
there
is
no
individual
harm
if
you're
being
subjected
to
a
seniority
system
that
you
don't
think
gives
you
the
protection
that
you're
entitled
to.
i
mean,
they
don't
have
the
job
security
right
away
that
they
think
they
should
have.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
why
a
lot
of
women
voted
against
this
thing,
i
think.
they
lost
seniority.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
is
a
harm.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
like
saying
you
don't
care
if
my
life
insurance
policy
is
going
to
be
cancelled
because
i
might
live
forever.
if
you're
harmed
right
at
the
time.
i
mean--
justice
john
paul
stevens
uh-huh.
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
mr.
shanor.
do
you
think
in
this
case
the...
as
the
fair
reading
of
the
complaint,
the
seniority
system
would
have
been
unlawful
even
if
they
couldn't
prove
any
invidious
intent
at
the
time
of
its
adoption?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
put
it
another
way.
supposing
that
the
proof
of
invidious
intent
failed,
just
for
a
hypothet...
prove
that...
really
was
just
trying
to
be
fair
to
everybody
and
work
out
a
way
to
give
women
an
opportunity
to
become
testers.
and
that,
nevertheless,
they
adopted
this
system.
and
the
system
has
caused
some
disparate
treatment
between
the
two
sexes.
would
it
be
a
lawful
or
unlawful
system,
as
alleged?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
instance,
if
she's
a
new
employee,
it's
pretty
hard
to
see
how
she'd
have
any
seniority
under
either
system.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
sure
you
answered
justice
white's
question.
i
think
the
question
was
whether
she
could
sue
even
within
the
180-day
period.
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
after
180
days
after
she
becomes
a
member
of
the
tester
unit,
two
years
after
the
adoption
of
the
plan?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
this
troubles
me.
we
talk
about
the
cases,
though,
that
the
whole
issue
is
the
discriminatory
intent
at
the
time
of
adoption.
but
there
are
portions
of
the
complaint
that
can
be
read
as
saying
that
the
effect
of
the
system
was
discriminatory
also.
and
if
the
effect
was
discriminatory,
then
why
couldn't
the
employee
sue
whenever
it
operated
against
that
employee?
