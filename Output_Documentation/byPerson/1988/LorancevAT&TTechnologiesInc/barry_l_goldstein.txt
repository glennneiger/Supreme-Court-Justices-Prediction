mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
by
this
case
is
may
a
female
worker
file
a
timely
charge
from
the
operation
of
a
selection
practice
designed
to
discriminate
against
female
workers
when
that
operation
causes
her
job
demotion,
as
the
company
and
the
union
intended.
this
record
dramatically
presents
this
issue
because
at&t
and
local
1942
conspired
to
change
the
seniority
system
to
advantage
male
workers
over
female
workers.
in
1982
the
petitioners
were
demoted
to
lower-paying
jobs
by
the
operation
of
this
discriminatory
seniority
system,
while
males
with
less
seniority
remained
in
the
higher-paying
jobs.
within
300
days,
within
the
time
requirement
required
by
title
vii,
the
petitioners
filed
charges
that
their
title
vii
rights
had
been
violated
by
the
operation
of
this
discriminatory
seniority
system.
nevertheless,
the
lower
court
granted
summary
judgment
against
petitioners
since
the
petitioners
did
not
file
within
300
days
of
first
becoming
subject
to
the
discriminatory
system
in
1979
and
1980,
although
the
system
at
that
time
did
not
operate
to
cause
them
to
lose
their
jobs.
both
petitioners
and
respondents
argue
that
the
lower
court
erred.
i
shall
describe
three
reasons,
based
upon
the
projected
operation
of
the
three
rules,
the
rules
proposed
by
petitioners
and
respondents
and
the
rule
adopted
by
the
seventh
circuit
as
to
why
the
petitioners'
rule
is
the
only
one
consistent
with
the
objective
of
title
vii
to
end
discriminatory
employment
practices
and
the
only
rule
consistent
with
the
efficient
judicial
administration
of
the
fair
employment
law.
first,
let
me
turn
to
the
opportunity
to
challenge
discriminatory
practices.
petitioners'
rule
is
straightforward.
it
would
permit
a
member
of
a
class
of
intended
victims
of
a
plan
to
discriminate
to
sue,
as
here,
when
they
are
harmed
by
the
implementation
of
that
discriminatory
plan.
petitioners'
rule
follows
from
this
court's
unanimous
decision
in
bazemore
that
the
pay
practice
at
issue
in
bazemore
was
illegal
even
though,
"it
is
a
mere
continuation
of
the
pre-1965
discriminatory
pay
structure.
"
similarly,
the
implementation
of
the
discriminatorily
designed
seniority
system
is
an
unlawful
employment
practice.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
it's
quite
correct.
i
think
in
bazemore
the
plaintiff
had
to
prove,
and
did
prove,
that
there
was
a
difference
in
pay
and
that
difference
in
pay
was
the
result
of
a
discriminatorily
designed
pay
structure
established
prior
to
1965.
it
was
the
two
parts,
it
was
the
continuation...
as
the
court
said,
the
mere
continuation
of
the
discriminatory
pay
structure
into
the
time
period,
as
well
as
the
fact
that
it
had
been
established
with
a
discriminatory
intent.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
no,
sir.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
in
fact,
the
lower
court
had
approved
the...
well,
had
said
that
the
pay
structure
was
not
discriminatory
because,
as
the
lower
court
said
and
the
supreme
court
credited,
the
system
had
been
operated
in
good
faith
from
1965
through
the
1970s
when
it
was
challenged.
it
was
not
on
its
face
discriminatory.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
the
lower
court
said
both.
that
it
was
merely
a
continuation
of
the
prior...
prior
discriminatory
practice
and
that
it
was
neutral
on
its
face,
as
is
the
seniority
system
at
issue
here.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
no.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
it
was
not.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
no,
justice
white.
in
1979
it
was
set
up
with
an
intent
to
discriminate.
however,
at&t
and
local
1942
were
clever
enough
not
to
put
their
invidious
purpose
in
the
written
contract
itself.
their
discriminatory
purpose
was
just
stated
on
the--
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
--yes,
sir,
it
was.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
no,
sir,
they
didn't
amend
it
in
1982.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
on
the
record,
the
seniority
system
stayed
in
effect--
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
--as
drawn
in
1979
through
the
period
pertinent
here,
and
that
discriminatory
intent
established
in
the
system
in
'79
continued
through
1982.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
that's
correct.
they
got
hurt,
as
the
union
and
the
company
intended.
the
senior
female
workers
were
demoted
while
junior
male
workers
stayed
in
the
higher-paying
jobs.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
well,
in
1979
it
was
clear
that
it
was
the
intent
of
the
union
to
put
in
a
discriminatory
system.
it
was
blatantly
stated
at
the
union
meeting.
what
was
not
clear
was
whether
or
not
the
system
would
ever
operate
in
certain
ways
to
harm
the
petitioners.
for
example,
under
the
system
if
you
stayed
a
tester,
the
higher-paying
male
job,
for
five
years,
you
bridged
your
seniority,
you
recaptured
your
plan
seniority.
when
petitioner
lorance
was
demoted,
she
was
a
few
months
away
from
recapturing
her
plan
seniority.
it
the
layoff
had
occurred
a
year
later,
she
would
never
have
been
harmed
in
this
way
by
the
system.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
yes,
justice
kennedy.
in
1979
it
was
clear
that
the
plan
in
many
hypothetical
ways
may
have
discriminated
against
the
women
testers
in
different
ways.
whether
it
would
in
fact
operate
to
discriminate
against
a
particular
female
tester
in
a
particular
way
was
unclear
and
ambiguous.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
i
believe
that
she
could.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
i
believe
she
could
have.
i
think
it's
a
somewhat
harder
question
than
the
one
here
when
there
was
a
clear
job
harm.
but
i...
and,
of
course,
the
claim
would
be
different
before
she
was
specifically
harmed
in
1979
than
in
1982.
but
i
believe
when
the
system
was
put
in
with
an
intent
to
discriminate,
which
classified
women
differently
than
men,
with
an
intent
to
discriminate,
and
affected
their
status
as
employees,
then,
yes,
they
could
bring
charges
upon
them.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
there
would
be
a
lot
of
proof
that
would
overlap.
there
would
some
proof,
of
course,
that
would
not
be
available
in
1980
before
the
system
was
implemented.
for
example,
there
would
be
no
proof
which
would
specifically
state
how
the
system
operated
and
what
its
specific
effect
was.
there
would
be,
i
can
imagine,
some
dispute
as
to
how
the
system
would
operate
and
what
its
effect
would
be.
the
advantage
of
permitting
workers
to
file
a
suit
after
they
have
been
specifically
harmed
is
we
know
then
at
that
time
how
the
system
will
operate
and--
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
--well,
it
can
go
on
so
long
as
the
union
and
the
company
continue
to
implement
their
intentionally
discriminatory
plan.
and
whenever
they
implement
it,
they
engage
in
unlawful
employment
practice
and
someone
who
is
harmed
by
it,
who
is
the
intended
victim
of
that
discrimination,
should
be
able
to
sue.
it
is
no
different
than
how
this
court
treats
constitutional
claims,
whether
it's
a
challenge
to
an
unconstitutional
statute,
such
as
in
hunter
v.
underwood
or
personnel
administrator
v.
feny,
when
the
court
went
back
to
what
was
the
intent
of
congress
after
the
civil
war
with
respect
to
providing
jobs
for
veterans.
if
there
is
an
unconstitutional
act
which
continues
to
harm
those...
that
class
of
persons
intended
to
be
harmed,
then
a
person
harmed
can
sue.
similarly,
in
title
vii,
if
there
is
an
unlawful
employment
scheme
designed
to
discriminate,
when
that
scheme
is
implemented
against
an
individual--
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
--yes,
they
could.
title
vii,
of
course,
should
not
reward
subterfuge
and
hiding
the
discrimination.
however--
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
i
misunderstood.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
well--
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
--this
is
a
defensive
mistake
of
fact.
they
tried--
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
--they
tried
to
put
in
a
plan
that
discriminated,
and
they
weren't
able
to
because--
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
--well,
under
the
petitioner's
rule,
there
has
to
be
a
discriminatory
harm.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
if
it
was
pursuant
to
a
plan
to
intentionally
discriminate
against
women,
it
would
be
enough.
yes,
sir.
the
respondent--
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
--i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
there
are
two
different
causes
of
actions
which
have
to
be
separated.
the
first
is...
as
pled
in
this
case,
is
that
there
is
a
discriminatory
scheme
that's
established
to
affect
women.
and
if
there
was
one
layoff,
one
woman
was
laid
off
who
was
senior
to
junior
males,
then
even
though
you
couldn't
show
through
the
statistical
study
that
women
as
a
class
were
being
adversely
affected,
that...
that
person
would
be
entitled
to
relief
under
a
discriminatory
treatment
theory.
the
plan
old
argument
that
there
was
a
discriminatory
plan
that
was
established
to
harm
women;
it
harmed
a
specific
woman.
there
is
a
second
type
of
case
in
which
i
agree
with
your
question
in
which
there
is
a
practice
set
up,
such
as
a
seniority
system.
it
operates
to
have
a
discriminatory
effect,
which
is
established
statistically.
at
the
point
the
plaintiffs
show
there
is
this
practice,
it
has
a
discriminatory
consequence.
and
at
that
point
in
time
the
question
becomes
whether
or
not
that
discriminatory
practice
is
protected
by
703(n),
that
is,
that
the
practice
is
a
bona
fide
seniority
system.
so,
i
think
there...
there's
two
separate
approaches
here.
one
is,
is
it
an
intentionally
discriminatory
scheme?
if
it
is
and
the
plaintiffs
show
that,
and
it
harms
an
individual
woman,
then
that's
an
unlawful
employment
practice.
they
could--
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
--well,
if
there
is
no
discriminatory
harm
against
a
woman,
she
wouldn't
have
a
claim.
when
i
answered
the
question
i
assumed
that
as
a
result
of
the
operation
of
the
system,
as
in
this
case,
a
woman
with
more
seniority
was
demoted,
lost
pay,
while
a
male
with
less
seniority
remains
in
the
job.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
justice
scalia,
two
points,
if
i
may.
the
first
is
the
machinists,
of
course,
interprets
the
statute
of
limitations
in
an
act
other
than
title
vii.
and
the
court,
in
footnote
15
in
machinists
expressly
stated
that
it
was
basing
its
interpretation
of
the
labor
law
on
the
basis
of
the
particular
legislative
history
and
purpose
of
the
labor
law.
it
was
not
writing
large
for
all
statute
of
limitations.
the
legislative
history
for
title
vii
is
quite
different
than
for
the
labor
law.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
as
far
as
i
know,
you
have
not.
i
believe
the
supreme
court
has
said
that
the
remedial
section
of
title
vii,
706(g),
is
modeled
on
the
remedial
section
of
the
labor
law.
but
that
the
statute
of
limitations
was
not
draw
on
the
labor
law.
in
fact,
the
legislative
history
is
just
to
the
contrary.
in
1972
when
title
vii...
when
the
limitations
period
was
extended
from
90
to
180
days,
180
days
being
the
same
period
under
the
labor
law.
when
congress
did
it
in
the
conference
committee
report
just
before
the
bill
was
voted
on
in
both
the
house
and
the
senate,
the
conference
committee
said
that
it
was
the
intent
to
have
an
unlawful
employment
practice
be
counted
from
the
last
occurrence
rather
than
the
first
occurrence
of
a
discriminatory
practice,
and
to
provide
the
maximum
benefit
of
law
to
the
victims
of
discrimination.
that
is
the
difference
with
the
labor
law,
which
was
focused
specifically
on
the
collective
bargaining
process
and
not
on
providing
individual
rights
to
the
victims
of
discrimination.
in
fact,
title
vii...
one
of
the
reasons
for
title
vii
was
that
the
labor
laws
unfortunately
had
not
worked
to
prevent
discrimination
in
the
workplace.
the
respondents'
position
would
immunize
seniority
systems
from
challenge
300
days
after
they
had
been
implemented.
some
female
workers
would
never
have
an
opportunity
to
challenge
the
practice
which
they
are
harmed
by
simply
if
they
were
hired
or
moved
from
another
department
into
the
department
with
the
discriminatory
practice
more
than
300
days
after
the
practice
went
into
effect.
the
female
workers
seek
to
file
a
timely
suit
when
a
practice
designed
to
discriminate
against
women
limits
their
work
opportunities.
this
is
a
straightforward
application
of
title
vii.
it
will
end
discriminatory
employment
practices.
petitioner
lorance
should
be
permitted
to
proceed
below
to
establish
that
the
company
and
union
conspired
to
discriminate
against
her
and
other
women
because
of
their
gender.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
please.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
thank
you.
justice
white
is
correct.
the
seniority
system
itself
must
illegal.
and
that
was
the
distinction
made
in
machinists.
even
if
machinists
applied,
which
we
don't
accept,
the
court
there
said
that
evidence
during
the
time-barred
period
could
be
used
to
illuminate
the
practice
that
occurred
during
the
period
within
the
time
limitations
period.
in
machinists
the
system
itself,
the
clause
itself,
was
not
challenged
as
discriminatory,
as
opposed
to
this
one.
the
system
itself
is
being
challenged.
that
is
precisely
what
the
court...
how
the
court
approached
seniority
issues
in
teamsters
and
patterson,
and,
in
fact
in
bazemore
distinguished
evans
by
saying
that
the
plaintiff
had
made
no
allegation
that
the
seniority
system
itself
was
intentionally
designed
to
discriminate.
implying,
of
course,
as
in
bazemore,
that
if
the
allegation
of
intentional
discrimination
in
the
design
had
been
made,
then
the
charge
would
have
been
timely
in
evans.
that,
of
course,
is
the
allegation
that
we
have
made.
in
conclusion,
i
would...
i
think
judge
cudahy
in
his
dissent
summed
up
the
case.
it's
a
simple
case,
as
he
said.
the
plaintiffs
filed
complaints
at
the
time
they
were
injured
by
demotion
in
the
way
the
defendants
allegedly
intended
them
to
be
injured.
viewed
in
that
direct
and
uncluttered
fashion,
their
complaints
are
timely.
