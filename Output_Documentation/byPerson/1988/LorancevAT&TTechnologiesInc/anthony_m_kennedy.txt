justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
may
i
ask--
--but
why
was
it
not
apparent
in
1979
that
it
would
have
a
discriminatory
effect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
1979
wasn't
it
clear
that
the
plan
could
have
that
effect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--suppose
that
a
woman
was
demoted
and
did
nothing
and
the
300
days
passed?
then
she's
laid
off.
can
she
sue
at
the
layoff
time?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
conceded
by
all
parties
that
the
plan
operates
neutrally
now?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
is
that
in
dispute?
