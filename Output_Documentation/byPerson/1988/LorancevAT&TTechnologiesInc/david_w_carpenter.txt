mr.
david
w.
carpenter
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
one
point
of
agreement
in
this
case,
i
think,
is
that
under
delaware
state
college
v.
ricks,
the
determination
of
the
timeliness
of
a
title
vii
claim
requires
a
court
to
identify
precisely
the
unfair
employment
practice
of
which
the
plaintiffs
complain,
and
the
300-day
limitation
period
is
keyed
to
the
date
of
that
event
and
not
to
consequences,
future
consequences,
of
the
event
that
are
not
themselves
discriminatory.
eeoc
and
petitioners
are
simply
refusing
to
face
up
to
the
consequences
of
this
rule
and
the
statutory
policy
against
litigating
stale
claims.
here
the
entire
basis
for
petitioners'
complaint
is
their
charge
that
we
acted
for
discriminatory
reasons
when
we
took
away
certain
plant-wide
seniority
rights
in
the
1979
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
adopted
the
tester
system.
if
their
allegations
were
true,
the
taking
away
of
those
rights
could
have
been
challenged
in
1979,
and
the
system
would
have
been
enjoined
then
and
there.
by
contrast,
what
plaintiffs
have
alleged
within
the
limitations
period
in
1982
are
simply
nondiscriminatory
consequences
of
the
1979
changeover
to
the
tester
system.
this
system
on
its
face
is
perfectly
valid
and
it's
the
kind
of
system
that
employers
and
unions
can
adopt
for
perfectly
legitimate
reasons
any
time.
and
plaintiffs
have
not
alleged
that
the
system
was
discriminatorily
administered
or
maintained
during
the
limitations
period.
the
1982
gown...
downgrades,
it's
conceded,
were
required
by
the
terms
of
this
collective
bargaining
agreement.
there
was
an
undisputed
lack
of
work,
and
petitioners
were
the
low
persons
on
the
seniority
totem
pole.
down...
the
downgrades
were
for
that
reason,
not
their
sex.
and
under
section
703(b)
that
is
not
unlawful
discrimination,
and
it's
not
unlawful
discrimination
even
if
it's
correct
that
the
system
had
a
disparate...
the
downgrades
had
a
disparate
impact
on
women.
this
is
just
like
ricks.
the
claim
there
was
time-barred
because
the
discharge
was
the
nondiscriminatory
consequence
of
the
denial
at
tenure.
and
the
denial
of
tenure
couldn't
be
challenged.
similarly,
when
the
downgrades
were
because
of
low
seniority,
then...
here
they're
most
nondiscriminatory
consequences
of
the
'79
changeover.
and
to
litigate
our
motive...
our
motive...
in
1979
and
threaten
to
dismantle
a
system
that's
operated
and
has
been
administered
nondiscriminatorily
for
years
would
epitomize
the
kind
of
litigation
that
the
statute
of
limitations
is
designed
to
prevent.
now,
petitioners'
proposed
way
around
ricks
is
their
argument
that
if
the
initial
adoption
of
the
system
was
discriminatorily
motivated,
then
each
subsequent
application
of
it
is
a
continuing
violation.
and
that
theory
was
rejected
by
the
court's
1960
decision
in
machinists.
as
justice
scalia
alluded
to,
the
critical
thing
there
is
that
if
it
had
been
established
that
the
union
lacked
majority
support
at
the
time
the
system
was
adopted,
then
each
subsequent
act
of
enforcing
it
would
have
been
a
continuing
violation.
but
the
court
said
that
challenges
to
the
enforcement
are
suable
unfair
labor
practices
only
during
the
six
months
statute
of
limitations.
they
said
it
would
destroy
the
stability
of
bargaining
relationships
and
lead
to
the
litigation...
and
produce
litigation
of
stale
claims
if
neutral
systems,
neutral
on
their
face,
can
be
a
challenge
on
the
basis
of
events
outside
the
limitations
period.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor,
some
of
the
most
vehement
opponents
to
the
adoption
of
this
tester
system
in
1979
were
women
who
weren't
testers.
their
contention
was
that
the
change
in
the
seniority
system
diluted
everybody's
rights
in
the
plant,
including
them.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
yes,
i
think
they
could
have
sued.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
anybody
who
was
an
employee.
now,
what--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--yes.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
uh-huh.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
that's...
that's
what
seems
the
source
of
our
disagreement
with
the
seventh
circuit...
the
seventh
circuit's
dictum
at
least.
as
to
an
employee
like
that,
she
would
come
on
the
job
and
then
she
would
be
subject
to
the
operation
of
a
seniority
system
that
is
lawful
because
it
is
being
nondiscriminatorily
maintained
and
applied
and
is
entitled
to
703(h)
protection.
she
wouldn't
have
anything
to
complain
about
because
she
wouldn't
be
the
victim
of
anything
that's
unlawful.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
but
then
she
would
not
be
the
victim
of
anything
unlawful
because
even
if
the
demotion
could
be
shown
to
have
a
disparate
impact,
that
would
not
be
sufficient
to
show
a
violation...
unlawful
discrimination
under
703(h)
and
all
this
court's
decisions
construing
it.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
we
say...
we
say
not,
your
honor,
because...
because
the
discrimination...
that
would
entail
the
litigation
of
events,
you
know,
10,
20,
30
years
later.
and
the
point
is
there
has
to
be
a
current
violation.
and
she,
during
the
limitations
period,
is
simply
being
subjected
to
the
lawful
operation
of
a
seniority
system.
so
we
say--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--she...
well,
let
me
just
make
this
very
clear.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
she
couldn't--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--she
couldn't
sue
solely
on
the
ground
that
the
initial
adoption
of
the
system
years
earlier
was
discriminatorily
motivated.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
she'd
have
to
show
something
discriminatory
within
the
180
days.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
yeah.
i
think
it's
a
very
hypothetical
question
because
probably
she
has
no
basis
for
showing
any
injury.
but
even
if...
even
if
she
did,
we
would
say
that
her
claim
would
be
time-barred
if
she
were
basing
the
claim
solely
on
these
remote--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--after
the
demotion?
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
after
the
initial
adoption?
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
oh,
yeah,
she
could
sue
then.
sure.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
well,
the--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--no,
she
could
not
sue
then.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
she
could--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--she
could
sue
then.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
she
could
sue
then.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
she
could
sue
then.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
well,
perhaps
i'm
being
too
generous.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
well,
no.
i
think...
i
think
we
would
have
a
powerful
argument
that
she
suffered
no
injury
for
the
reasons
you
stated.
but
she
would
be
able
to
argue,
i
suppose,
that
but
for
a
discriminatory
motive
there
would
have
been
a
more
favorable...
a
seniority
system
more
favorable
to
her.
and
even
though
she
wasn't
an
employee
at
the
time
of
adoption,
that
she
could...
still
had
something
to
complain
about.
but
this
is
a
very
hypothetical
question,
i
think,
for
the
reasons
justice
stevens
identified.
on
the
machinists
case,
the--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
well,
because
under
703(h)
and
this
court's
decisions
construing
it,
a
showing
of
disparate
impact
is
insufficient
to
invalidate
a
seniority
system.
that's
the
holding
of
teamsters,
saint,
and
a
whole
line
of
cases
of
this
court
under
703(h).
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
yes.
the
differences
in
treatment
have
to
be
the
result
of
an
intention
to
discriminate.
a
mere
showing
of
disparate
impact
is
not
sufficient
to
show
a
violation.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
there
is
no
allegation--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--there
is
no
allegation
that
it
didn't,
and
it
was
conceded
below
that
these...
that
the
demotions
were
required
by
the
terms
of
the
plan,
the
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
distinction
of
machinists
that
petitioners
and
eeoc
make
in
their
briefs
is
that
the
challenge
there
was
to
the
method
of
execution
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
that
there
was
some
error
in
the
execution.
the
challenge
wasn't
that
the
clause
was
unlawful.
but
that
is
just
incorrect
because
if
the
employer...
if
the
union
lacked
a
majority,
it's
unlawful
discrimination
and
a
violation
of
section
8(a)(3)
of
the
nlra
for
an
employer
to
force
an
employee
to
join
a
union.
so,
in
both
machinists
and
this
case,
the
claim
is
that
a
facially
neutral
provision
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
unlawfully
discriminate...
discriminatory
in
violation
of
a
statute.
and
this
isn't
just
the
language
in
the
machinists
case;
it's
the
holding.
so,
the
only
possible
answer
to
machinists
is
petitioners'
suggestion
that
title
vii
statute
of
limitations
should
be
interpreted
different...
should
be
interpreted
differently
than
the
nlra's.
but
this
court
explicitly
stated
in
zipes
v.
twa
that
the
time
limitations
under
title
vii
should
be
treated
likewise
as
under
the
nlra.
and
it
refers
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
'72
amendments.
and
the
fact
is
that
these
are
both
labor
statutes.
they're
both...
have
the
purpose
of
barring
litigation
of
stale
claims
and
promoting
the
stability
of
bargaining
relationships.
so,
there's
no
basis,
in
our
view,
to
have
a
different
rule,
even
if
there
weren't
that
language
in
zipes.
now,
here
we
are
simply
urging
the
rule
that
the
lower
courts
uniformly
apply
under
the
nlra
and
suits
under
section
301
of
the
labor
management
relations
act.
the
rule
there
is
that
when
there
is
a
neutral
change
in
the
seniority
system,
the
employee
has
to
challenge
it
then
and
there.
if
the
employee
waits
until
he's
downgraded
or
laid
off
in
the
future
outside
the
limitations--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--such
that
after
the
change
is
made
the
system
is
neutral
on
its...
on
its
face.
like
our
tester
system
is
here.
not
discriminatory
on
its
face.
but
the
rule
there
is
that
if
they
wait
and--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--it...
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
what
the
factual
effect
of
it
is.
but
if
it
were
discriminatory
on
its
face,
if
it
classified
employees
on
the
basis
of
race
or
sex
or
some
other
statutorily-prohibited
criterion,
then
you
wouldn't
have
these
staleness
problems
because
you'd
be
looking
at
the
criteria
that
were
in
fact
applied
during
the
limitations
period.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
yes,
and
that's
the
point.
that's
exactly
the
point.
and,
you
know,
apart
from
the
nlra
cases,
you
know,
we
think
evans
and
ricks
simply
follow
the
same
methodology
as
machinists.
if
you
have
neutral
and
otherwise
lawful
conduct
within
the
limitations
period,
it
can't
be
challenged
solely
on
the
basis
of
events
outside
the
limitations
period.
contrary
to
the
eeoc's
argument,
we
don't
think
the
decision
in
ricks
rested
in
any
way
on
the
fact
that
the
discharge
was
the
inevitable
consequence
of
denial
of
tenure.
the
point
there
was
that
if
you
litigated
the
denial
of
tenure
outside
the
limitations
period,
you'd
have
staleness
problems.
we
submit
the
result
would
have
been
the
same
if
ricks
had
been
allowed
to
continue
to
work
as
a
non-tenured
faculty
member
and
there
had
been
some
change
in
the
economy
and
all
non-tenured
faculty
members
had
been
fired
five
years
later.
at
that
point,
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
purpose
of
the
limitations
period
to
allow
ricks
to
come
in
and
challenge
the
denial
of
tenure
five
years
later.
the
bazemore
case,
which
is
the
principal
case
on
which
our
opponents
rely,
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
this
case
because
that's
a
situation
where
blacks
were
paid
less
than
whites
for
the
same
work
during
the
limitations
period.
what
that
case
establishes
is
that
when
there
is
a
current
violation,
it's
actionable,
even
if
past
violations
weren't
also
challenged.
here
there
is
no
current
violation
alleged.
and,
moreover,
in
view
of
this
court's
decision
in
florida
v.
long
of
last
june,
i
think
it's
a
reading
of...
an
overly-broad
reading
of
bazemore
that
would
somehow
sweep
in
this
case...
it's
clearly
foreclosed
because
long
indicates
that
even
some
current
violations
of
title
vii
can't
be
enjoined
when
they
would
retroactively
upset
reasonable
reliance
interests.
and
that's
the
case
here.
when
a
facially
valid
seniority
system
is
adopted
and
not
challenged
within
300
days,
and
then
nondiscriminatorily
administered,
employers
and
employees
alike
reasonably
change
their
position
in
all
sorts
of
fundamental
ways
in
reliance
on
the
system.
to
allow
a
challenge
to
that
system
to
be
brought
years,
decades,
later
would
upset
those
reliance
interests.
really,
the
ultimate
question
here
is
whether
this
is
a
case
challenging
a
seniority
system
on
the
grounds
that
it's
not
entitled
to
protection
under
703(h).
and
the
ultimate
question
here
is
whether
there
is
any
basis
in
the
statute
for
exempting
703(h)
challenges
from
the
statute
of
limitations
of
title
vii.
and
it
couldn't
be
clearer
that
congress
intended
no
such
thing.
section
706(e)'s
limitation
period
applies
to
all
claims.
there
is
no
exception
there
for
challenges
to
seniority
systems.
and
to
exempt
challenges
to
seniority
systems
from
the
limitations
period
would
be
absolutely
irreconcilable
with
the
purposes
of
703(h)...
703(h)
was
part
of
the
mansfield-dirksen
compromise.
it
was
the
quid
pro
quo
for
the
inclusion
of
title
vii
in
the
'64
civil
riqhts
act.
the
whole
reason
for
703(h)
is
that
congress
recognized
that
seniority
is
of
critical
importance
in
collective
bargaining,
and
it's
of
critical
importance
to
workers.
the
whole
purpose
was
to
assure
that
title
vii
wouldn't
destroy
the
reliance
interests
that
are
built
up
around
the
routine
and
nondiscriminatory
administration
of
neutral
seniority
systems.
a
rule
that
permits
these
systems
to
be
challenged
and
dismantled
after
they've
operated
for
years
or
decades,
as
their
rule
would,
is
absolutely
irreconcilable
with
that
purpose.
and
for
that
reason,
we
submit
that
the
lower
court's
decision
to
dismiss
this
case
was
absolutely
correct
and
that
it
should
be
affirmed.
if
there's
no
further
questions,
i'll
submit.
