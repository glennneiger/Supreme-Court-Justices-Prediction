justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
but
in
bazemore
the
violation
was
not
the
establishment
of
the
pay
structure.
i
mean,
that
was
not
what
the
plaintiff
had
to
prove
in
order
to
make
the
case.
all
the
plaintiff
had
to
prove
was
a
difference
in
pay,
not
that
it
was
established
discriminatorily.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
was
on
its
face
discriminatory,
wasn't
it?
i
mean,
did--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
was
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
the
lower
court
had
said
it
was
not
discriminatory
only
because
it
was
a
continuation
of
a
prior
system
and
that
was
okay,
even
though
if
you
just
looked
at
it
objectively
at
any
single
moment,
it
was
discriminatory.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
goldstein,
this
dual
violation
that
there
is
one
when
the
agreement
is
executed
and
another
one
when
the
person
is
fired,
this
argument
was
explicitly
made
and
rejected
in
machinists.
we
said...
this
is
a
quote
from
what
we
said
in
machinists...
"it
may
be
conceded
that
the
continued
enforcement
as
well
as
the
execution
of
this
collective
bargaining
agreement
constitutes
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
that
these
are
two
logically
separate
violations
independent
in
the
sense
that
they
can
be
described
in
discrete
terms.
"
"nevertheless,
the
vice
in
the
enforcement
of
this
agreement
is
manifestly
not
independent
of
the
legality
of
its
execution,
as
would
be
the
case,
for
example,
with
an
agreement
invalid
on
its
face
or
with
one
validly
executed
but
unlawfully
administered.
"
i
mean,
this
is
the
same
argument
that
you're
making
to
us,
and
we
explicitly
rejected
it
in
machinists.
justice
antonin
scalia
we've
said
that
the
two
are
the
same,
haven't
we?
haven't
we
said
that
the
statute
of
limitations
for
title
vii
was
drawn
upon...
was
modeled
upon
the
one
for
the
national
labor
relations
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
other
people
in
the
unit
who
take
the
job
thinking
that
they
nave
a
certain
seniority?
these
are
the
people
who
are
not
affected
discriminatorily,
could
not
possibly
be.
and
then
six
years
down
the
line
after
they've
worked
there
thinking
they
had
this
seniority,
somebody
brings
a
suit
and
they
suddenly
find
out
that
they
don't
have
it,
they
should
have
gone
to
work
somewhere
else.
is
that
the
kind
of
a
system
we
ought
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
we're
talking
about
people
who
could
have
sued
at
the
outset.
chose...
as
you
say,
chose
not
to.
then,
six
years
down
the
line
when
they
do
find
out
that
actually,
yes,
this
seniority
that
they
lost
is
going
to
affect
them,
then
they
bring
suit
and
they
upset
the
expectations
of
everyone
else
in
the
unit.
why
is
that
a
fair
system?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
had
a
cause
of
action,
as
you
say.
right
at
the
outset...
as
soon
as
that
was
done,
they
could
have
sued.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
the
issue
in
ricks
was
the
same
as
the
issue
here.
was
he
harmed
when
he
was
denied
tenure,
which
is
really
just
an
academic
name
for
seniority,
or
was
he
harmed
when
he
was
dismissed
because
he
didn't
have
tenure?
he
couldn't
have
been
dismissed
if
he
had
had
tenure.
we
said,
no,
the
harm
occurs
when
he's
denied
tenure
even
though
the
dismissal
occurs
later.
well,
i
don't
see
how
that's
any
different
from
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
wasn't
bumped
out
of
his
job.
he
kept
his
job.
he
just...
he
just
didn't
have
tenure.
and
the
next
year
he
was...
he
was
dismissed.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
was
it
clear
in
ricks
that
he
had
to
be
dismissed
a
year
later?
couldn't
they
have
kept
him
on
two
years,
three
years
if
they
wanted
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
carpenter,
what
about...
what
about
a
female
employee
of
at&t
who
was
not
in
the
tester
unit
at
the
time
it
was
originally
set
up
but
later
came
into
it
and
came
into
it
without
seniority
because
of
the
system
that
was
adopted
originally.
she
wouldn't
have
known
to
sue
originally.
how
do
you...
how
do
you
solve
that
problem?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
they
could
have
sued?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
no.
nothing's
happened.
she's
just
joined
the
plan.
it's
still
within
the
180-day
period
and
she
says--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
see,
i
don't
understand
why.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
i'm
talking
about
180
days
after...
within
180
days
after
adoption
of
the
new
system.
justice
antonin
scalia
five
days
after
the
new--
justice
antonin
scalia
--system
is
adopted,
she
joins
the
plan--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
not
as
a
tester.
she
could
sue.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
she
hadn't
lost
anything.
she
came
into
a
system
knowing
that
this
plant
had
this
system.
the
system
is
not
discriminatory
on
its
face.
i
mean,
the
women
who
have
been
there
already,
i
understand
how
they've
been
deprived
of
something.
they've
been
deprived
of
seniority
that
they
have
been
accumulating.
but
she
comes
brand
new
into
what
you
say
is
a
nondiscriminatory
system.
what...
why...
why
would
she
have
a
cause
of
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
not
concerned
about
your
being
generous.
i'm
concerned
about
your
being
illogical.
[laughter]
