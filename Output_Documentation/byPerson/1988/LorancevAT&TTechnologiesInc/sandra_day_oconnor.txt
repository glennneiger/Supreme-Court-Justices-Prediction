mr.
goldstein,
could
a
female
tester
have
filed
a
suit
in
your
view
in,
let's
say,
1980
before
any
demotion
had
occurred?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
that
have
been
possible
to
do?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
such
a
suit
were
filed,
would
the
proof
be
essentially
the
same
as
the
proof
in
the
suit
that
was
actually
filed
now?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
problem
is
how
to
fit
the
300-day
limit
in.
under
your
theory,
it
would
just
go
on
indefinitely,
i
assume.
a
suit
could
have
been
filed
then
or
you
could
wait
until
there
was
some
concrete
injury.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--when
is
the
first
time
that
a
female
tester
could
have
brought
a
suit
here,
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
there
could
have
been
a
suit
filed
right
after
the
adoption
of
the
plan?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
might
alter
the
remedy.
but
i
guess
some
remedy
could
be
obtained
at
that
time
then,
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
language
in
machinists
local
and
delaware
state
college?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
delaware
state
college?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
about...
what
about
someone
who
wasn't
an
employee?
they
come
from--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--another
town
and
apply
for
a
job,
come
in
later.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
when
can
they
sue?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
until
she
gets
demoted.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
she
were
subsequently
demoted,
could
she
sue
on
the
basis
of
the
discriminatory
intent
that's
alleged
when
the
plan
was
adopted?
