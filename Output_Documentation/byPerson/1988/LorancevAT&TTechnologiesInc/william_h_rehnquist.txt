chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
on
no.
87-1428,
patricia
lorance
v.
at&t
technologies.
mr.
goldstein,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
doesn't
the
result
have
to
be
discriminatory
too?
supposing...
following
up
justice
steven's
hypothesis...
that
there
is
intent
to
discriminate
but
the
plan...
don't
look
at
the
clock.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
here
to
answer
questions
as
well
as
to
talk.
so
that
no
harm
actually
occurs
and
the
plan
on
its
face
works
perfectly
fairly.
is
still
a
cause
of
action
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
the
way
the
thing
works
is
not
discriminatory
at
all?
it
was
intended
to
discriminate
but
incompetent
people
drew
it
up
and
simply
failed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
goldstein.
mr.
shanor.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
shanor--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
was
a
claim
that
it
discriminatorily
harmed
him,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
that
statute
limitations
questions
should
be
treated
differently
if
the
plan
was
intentionally
discriminatory,
as
opposed
to
discriminatory
in
fact?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
shanor.
mr.
carpenter.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
a
neutral
change
in
a
seniority
system,
what
do
you
mean?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
the
law
is
that
disparate
impact
isn't
enough
to
invalidate
a
seniority
system,
why
does
it
make
any
difference
how...
what
the
fact...
factual
effect
of
it
is
so
long
as
it's
not
intentionally
discriminatory?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
carpenter.
mr.
goldstein,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
goldstein.
the
case
is
submitted.
