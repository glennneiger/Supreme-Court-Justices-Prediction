mr.
charles
a.
shanor
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
united
states
and
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission,
which
i
serve
as
general
counsel,
support
petitioners'
contention
that
the
alleged
unlawful
employment
practices
here
occurred
when
respondents
demoted
petitioners,
not
when
the
test
or
concept
was
adopted
or
when
petitioners
first
became
testers,
as
the
seventh
circuit
held.
only
this
rule
fulfills
congress'
intent
that
section
706(e)
be
interpreted
to
give
charging
parties
the
maximum
benefit
of
the
law
by
looking
at
the
last--
mr.
charles
a.
shanor
--rather
than
first
occurrence.
mr.
charles
a.
shanor
your
honor,
notwithstanding
language
in
this
court's
american
tobacco
company
opinion
that
the...
quote...
"the
adoption
of
a
seniority
system
which
has
not
been
applied
would
not
give
rise
to
a
cause
of
action,
a
discriminatory
effect
would
arise
only
when
the
employer
applies
the
system.
"
we
believe
that
a
separate
violation
could
have
been
alleged
but
need
not
have
been
alleged
at
that
time.
mr.
charles
a.
shanor
there
could
have
been,
your
honor,
but
for
a
variety
of
reasons
we
think
it
would
be
unwise
to
adopt
the
rule
that
only
at
that
time
could
a
suit
be
filed
because
people
would
not
know
whether
or
not
they
had
been
injured
by
that
particular
system.
perhaps
no
harm
would
come
to
an
individual
personally
from
the
adoption
of
such
a
system,
such
as
in
this
case
where
the
individuals
hoped
to
bridge
to
their
plant-wide
seniority.
mr.
charles
a.
shanor
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
shanor
justice
scalia,
this
court
has
never
been
hesitant
to
regress
discrimination
in
order
to
put
individuals
back
into
the
place
that
they
should
have
been
in
but
for
that
discrimination.
that's
the
rule
of
franks
against
bowman.
it's
been
the
rule
ever
since.
mr.
charles
a.
shanor
your
honor,
it's
fair
because
the
seniority
rights
of
the
petitioners
were
altered
by
the
respondents
allegedly
for
discriminatory
purposes.
mr.
charles
a.
shanor
correct,
your
honor,
they
could
have
sued.
although
i
say
could
have
sued,
some
of
them
were
not
even
members
of
the
tester
universe
at
that
time.
as
to
those
individuals,
they
couldn't
have
sued.
as
to
the
other
individuals,
perhaps
as
soon
as
soon
as
they
came
on
the
job,
they
could
have
sued
within
300
days
of
when
they
got
the
job.
but
at
that
point
they
were
neophytes
to
the
jobs,
perhaps
had
inadequate
information
concerning
the
discrimination.
and,
moreover,
they
hadn't
been
individually
harmed.
so,
they
would
have
been
challenging
in
a
relatively
hypothetical
way
before
the
eeoc
and
the
courts
rather
than
in
a
concrete
way
where
they
had
been
individually
harmed.
mr.
charles
a.
shanor
yes,
there's--
mr.
charles
a.
shanor
--your
honor,
we--
mr.
charles
a.
shanor
--there
is
harm
to
loss
of
seniority.
but
whether
that
loss...
this
is...
this
is
competitive
seniority,
not
benefit
seniority.
and
whether
competitive
seniority
loss
will
later
harm
you,
depends
upon
whether
you
are
at
some
future
point
in--
mr.
charles
a.
shanor
--competition
with
someone--
mr.
charles
a.
shanor
--i
would
have
to
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
shanor
there
is
no
question
but
that
it
is
a
harm.
there
are
also
additional
harms
which
occurred
down
the
road.
you
can't
tell
whether
or
not
or
to
what
extent
a
reduction
of
your
competitive
seniority--
mr.
charles
a.
shanor
--well,
your
honor,
the
argument
is
not
that
they
weren't
harmed,
but
simply
that
this
statute
designed
where
there
is
a
continuing
violation
of
a
seniority
system
in
effect
over
many
years,
designed
to
intentionally
harm
petitioners
can
be
challenged
at
the
point
of
that
harm,
not
merely
at
the
time
when
the
system
was
put
into
place.
mr.
charles
a.
shanor
no,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
would
be
the
evans
case.
the
particular
demotion,
the
particular
layoff
is
a
discrete
point
in
time.
as
that
becomes
300...
an
event
300
days
in
the
past,
one
cannot
challenge
that
particular
event.
what
distinguishes
this
case
is
the
fact
that
there
is
an
ongoing
employment
system
whose
effects
were
intended
to
go
on
for
many
years
by
the
respondents.
and
it
is
that
system
which
congress
called
a
continuing
violation,
which
is
the
heart
of
why
this
is
different
from
evans,
from
ricks,
and
from
chardon.
mr.
charles
a.
shanor
in
machinists
local,
your
honor,
we
would
have
to
concede
that
there
is
language
which,
if
strictly
followed
in
this
case,
would
cause
petitioners
to
lose
the
case.
it
should
not
be.
mr.
charles
a.
shanor
in
delaware
state
college
against
ricks,
your
honor,
there
was
absolutely
no
allegation
that
the
tenure
system
involved
in
that
case
operated
intentionally
to
discriminate.
merely
that
there
was
an
aberrational
application
of
that
system
to
the
petitioner,
which
harmed
the
petitioner.
and
in
that
case
there
was--
mr.
charles
a.
shanor
--yes,
there
was
a
claim
that
there
was
a
discriminatory
harm
of
the
particular
tenure
denial.
mr.
charles
a.
shanor
yes,
your
honor.
it's
the
continuing
violation
of
the
existence
of
a
seniority
system
over
time
that
distinguishes
this
case
from
ricks.
mr.
charles
a.
shanor
your
honor,
this
case
would
be...
would
be
the
ricks
case
if
on
the
day
of
the
adoption
of
this
seniority
system
this
woman
had
been
bumped
out
of
her
job
and
she
waited
more
than
300
days
to
challenge
being
bumped
out
of
that
job.
mr.
charles
a.
shanor
but
the
specific
and
predictable,
indeed
inevitable
event
of
that
single
event,
tenure
denial,
was
simply
a
specific
effect
a
year
later
that
he
lost
his
job.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
such
predictable
effect
to
a
long-term
system
which
may
or
may
not
have
had
some
future
adverse
effect
to
any
individual
petitioner.
mr.
charles
a.
shanor
the
system
in
effect,
the
tenure
system,
said
no,
after
a
terminal
year
you're
out.
mr.
charles
a.
shanor
your
honor,
that's
a
very
difficult
question.
paragraphs
6,
18,
19,
and
20
all
specify
not
merely
that
there's
a
problem
with
the
adoption,
but
with
the
continuing
discriminatory
effects
of
the
system.
this
is
not
a
wholly-benign
system,
as
this
court
referred
to
what
was
going
on--
mr.
charles
a.
shanor
--we
would
concede
that
would
be
lawful
under
section
703(n).
this
is,
however,
a
situation,
your
honor,
in
which
the
fact
of
discriminatory
intent
at
the
time
of
adoption
has
separate
evidentiary
value
for
whether
or
not
there's
been
a
703(n)
bona
fide
seniority
system--
mr.
charles
a.
shanor
--or
a
non-sheltered
system.
and
if
it's
not
a
sheltered
bona
fide
seniority
system,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
system
then
would
be
actionable
separately
under
title
vii
because
it
has...
if
it
has
a
discriminatory
impact.
