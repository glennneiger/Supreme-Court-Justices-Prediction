so,
you
don't
claim
that
in
'79
when
it
was
set
up
that
it
was
discriminatory
on
its
face?
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
when...
but
it
'82
it
did
become
discriminatory
on
its
face,
i
take
it.
no?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
position
is,
yes,
it
was
intentionally
discriminatory
in
'79?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
about
'82?
didn't
they
amend
it
in
'82?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
did
they
do
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes?
justice
byron
r.
white
and...
and
it's
just
that...
it's
just
that
your
clients
got
hurt
by
it
in
'82?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was...
isn't
that
right?
so,
that's
pretty
concrete
harm,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
true--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
you,
nevertheless,
have
right
then
and
there
lost
seniority.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
even
if
she
was
demoted
within
the
limitations
period,
she
couldn't
sue.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
new
employee.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
new
employee.
justice
byron
r.
white
she
would
have
to
prove
something
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
has
to
be
an
illegal
system
in
itself?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
always...
what
you're
saying
is
that
that
shows
on
its
face
that
there
is
an
intentional
discrimination.
