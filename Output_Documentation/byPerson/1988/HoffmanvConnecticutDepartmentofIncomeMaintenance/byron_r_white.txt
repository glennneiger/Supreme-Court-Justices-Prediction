justice
white
where
did
you
bring
it?
justice
white
before
whom?
justice
white
the
bankruptcy
judge?
justice
white
what
about
some
claim
against
the
state
unrelated
to
their
claim?
justice
white
but
that...
your
interpretation
of
section...
of
(c)
isn't
the
only
interpretation
that
(c)
is
subject...
is
that
is
not
the
only
way
it
might
be
interpreted.
after
all,
there
are
a
lot
of...
your
obligation
as
the
trustee
was
to
file
a
list
of
creditors,
right?
justice
white
and
whether
or
not
they
filed
claims,
if
you
know
from
the
books
that
you
owe
them,
you
list
them,
don't
you?
justice
white
don't
you?
justice
white
don't
you
anymore
file
a
list
of
claims
against
the
estate?
justice
white
yes,
yes.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
in
an
ordinary
liquidation
bankruptcy,
do
you...
do
you
ever
allow
a
claim
that...
that
some
creditor
hasn't
filed
for?
justice
white
you
don't...
you
don't...
you
never
allow...
you
never
allow
a
claim
that...
that
there
hasn't
been
a
proof
of
claim
filed
on?
justice
white
when
you
know...
when
you
know
that
the
estate
owes
something,
you
don't
say
we
should
pay
them?
justice
white
well,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
think
that
(c)
was
surplussage
either,
did
they?
justice
white
it
ruled
against
you,
even
though...
even
though...
even...
even
in...
in
footnote
5
they
thought
that
(c)
had
its
own
meaning.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
you
were
still
hungry.
[laughter]
justice
white
well,
the
state
knows
that
if
they
just
stay
out
of
the...
at
least
they
thought
if
they
just
stay
out
of
the
proceeding,
they
won't
have
to
pay
the
money.
justice
white
unless
they're
sued...
unless
you
sue
them
in
their
own
court.
justice
white
of
course,
the
state
may
owe
$4,000
and
you
may
owe
it
only
a
thousand.
justice
white
so,
they'd
just
as
soon
as
keep
the
three.
justice
white
i
don't
understand
that.
give
me
an
example.
justice
white
your
opponent
says
that...
says
that
that's
just
a
figment
of
the
imagination
because
of
the...
you
never
unless...
he
says
he
never
lists
a
creditor
unless
there's
a
claim
filed.
i
don't
think
i
agree
with
him,
but...
i
take
it
you
think
that--
justice
white
--you...
especially
in
a
chapter
11,
the
trustee
files
a
list
of
creditors,
doesn't
he?
justice
white
well,
then
it
may
be
allowed.
it
may
still
be
allowed.
justice
white
exactly.
then
he's
bound.
they're
bound.
justice
white
right.
justice
white
you
cite
those
in
your
brief?
justice
white
okay.
if
you
intended
to
limit
it
to
that
situation,
why
would
he
use
that
language
of
one,
just...
to
cover
just
those
situations
where
the
states
would
be
bound
by...
by
judgments,
although
you
couldn't
affirmatively
get
any
money
from
them.
why
would
he
use
the
phrase
"a
provision
of
this
title
which
contains
creditor,
entity
or
governmental
unit.
"
to
refer
to
all
of
those
provisions
wholesale.
i
can't
understand
why
one
would
do
that.
justice
white
that
was
the
situation
in
the
chandler
act,
wasn't
it?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
i
know,
i
know.
justice
white
so,
in
this
respect
you
say
the
new
law
changed
things?
justice
white
yes,
and
they
are
allowed
for
that.
justice
white
yes.
and
if
they...
and
if
you
allow
them
a
certain
amount
and
the
state
hasn't
come
in,
it's
nevertheless
stuck.
it's
bound
by
the...
by
the
court's
determination.
justice
white
yes,
exactly.
mr.
hoffman,
before
you
leave,
could...
could
you
tell
me...
you...
you
said
that
your
brief
contained
those
sections
that
you
think
would
be
covered
by
(c)
but
are
not
covered
by
1(b).
what
pages
in
your
brief
are
they?
