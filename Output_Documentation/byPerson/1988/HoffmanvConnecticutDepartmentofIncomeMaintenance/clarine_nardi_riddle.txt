mr.
clarine
nardi
riddle
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
of
connecticut
supports
the
united
states
in
its
interpretation
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
award
money
damages
against
unconsenting
states
in
federal
court
under
the
bankruptcy
code.
we
also
believe
with
the
opposite
conclusion
that
if
congress
did
intend
to
abrogate
the
states'
eleventh
amendment
immunity
pursuant
to
the
bankruptcy
clause,
that
that
would
not
pass
constitutional
muster.
it
is
because
it
is
our
contention
that
the
eleventh
amendment
prevents
congress
from
abrogating
the
state's
eleventh
amendment
immunity
with
respect
to
money
damages
in
federal
courts.
and
that's
for
two
reasons.
the
bankruptcy
clause,
in
both
its
language
and
its
history,
is
not
directed
at
states,
nor
is
it
directed
at
limitations
at
state...
of
state
activity.
and,
number
two,
the
bankruptcy
clause
was
enacted
prior
to
the
eleventh
amendment
and
is,
therefore,
subject
to
it.
in
stark
contrast
to
the
10
amendments
before
the
eleventh
amendment,
the
eleventh
amendment
is,
in
essence,
a
protection
of
states.
the
core
under
the
modern
case
law
of
the
eleventh
amendment
is
the
protection
of
unconsenting
states
from
jurisdiction
by
federal
courts
in
money
damages
claims.
mr.
clarine
nardi
riddle
yes.
mr.
clarine
nardi
riddle
absolutely.
the...
the
core
of
the
eleventh
amendment
is
the
protection
of
states
and
the
federal
system
and
the
recognition
of
the
appropriate
spheres
of
sovereignty
of
the
two.
in
the
191-year
history
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
this
court
has
allowed
congress
to
override
the
eleventh
amendment
with
only
one
other
constitutional
provision,
and
that
is
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
the
1976
case
of
fitzpatrick
versus
bitzer,
this
court
noted
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
represented
a
shift
in
the
federal-state
balance
under
the
constitution.
the
court
said
that
through
the
enforcement
provision
of
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
that
congress
could
abrogate
the
states'
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
the
question
is,
how
far
does
that
holding
go?
does
any
grant
of
power
to
congress
have
the
effect
of
possibly
overriding
the
eleventh
amendment
and
thereby
making
it
a
nullity?
does
it
extend
to
the
possibility
that
congress
by
a
majority
vote
could
override
what
article
v
sets
out,
which
is
a
procedure
for
amending
the
constitution?
i
would
posit
that
fitzpatrick
does
not
go
that
far
and
that
that
the
opinion
of
fitzpatrick
is
the
limiting
principle.
fitzpatrick
says
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
by
its
express
terms
directed
at
the
states
and
by
its
own
terms
is
a
limitation
on
state
authority.
if
you
look
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
language,
it
says,
"nor
shall
any
state
deprive
any
person
of
life,
liberty
or
property
without
due
process
of
law,
nor
deny
to
any
person
within
its
jurisdiction
the
equal
protections
of
the
law.
"
section
5
of
that
amendment
says
that
"congress
shall
by
appropriate
legislation
enforce
the
provisions
of
this
article.
"
so,
the
fourteenth
amendment,
enacted
after
the
eleventh
amendment,
makes
the
eleventh
amendment
subject
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
bankruptcy
clause,
on
the
other
hand,
is
of
a
different
sort.
the
bankruptcy
clause
addresses
economic
issues.
the
concern
of
the
drafters
of
the
bankruptcy
clause
was
a
uniform
law
of
bankruptcy
to
deal
with
the
discharge
of
debtors
across
the
united
states.
the
language
of
the
clause
says
that
congress
shall
establish
a
uniform
law
on
the
subject
of
bankruptcy
throughout
the
united
states.
it
is
not
by
its
language
directed
at
states,
nor
does
it
affect
state
activity.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
history
of
the...
of
the
bankruptcy
clause
does
not
either
prohibit
state
activity.
in
the
19th
century
there
were
many
years
when
we
did
not
have
a
federal
bankruptcy
code.
in
those
instances
states
enacted
their
own
bankruptcy
codes.
and,
on
many
occasions,
this
court
affirmed
the
authority
of
those
state
to
have
those
codes.
in
the
1819
case
of
sturges
versus
crowninshield,
chief
justice
john
marshall
said,
"it
is
not
the
mere
existence
of
the
bankruptcy
power,
but
its
exercise
by
congress
that
contravenes
that
exercise
by
states.
"
so,
we
have
both
the
language
and
the
history
of
the
bankruptcy
clause
not
prohibiting
state
activity
in
the
area.
significantly
with
section
106
of
the
bankruptcy
clause
that
is
at
issue
in
this
case
today,
congress
specifically
said
that
it
did
not
feel
it
had
the
authority
to
abrogate
or
to
waive
the
state's
sovereign
immunity
completely.
additionally,
the
bankruptcy
clause,
as
prior
enacted
to
the
eleventh
amendment,
is
subject
to
it.
in
conclusion,
when
we're
attempting
to
harmonize
both
the
eleventh
amendment
with
the
other
provisions
in
the
constitution,
the
fitzpatrick
versus
bitzer
holding
makes
good
sense,
where
those
situations
where
other
constitutional
provisions
have
language
that
are
directed
at
states,
that
limit
state
authority
and
that
have
specific
enforcement
provisions
directed
at
congress,
those
provisions,
those
provisions
can
then
have
the
vindication
of
federal
rights
through
money
damages
actions
against
states.
but
if
you
have
a
provision
in
the
constitution
that
is
like
the
bankruptcy
clause,
which
is
not
directed
at
state
activity,
then
you
have
to
accommodate
different
competing
interests
and
that
those
federal
rights,
those
federal
issues
can
be
vindicated
through
declaratory
or
injunctive
relief,
suits
by
the
united
states
government,
inducements
of
waiver
as
you
see
with
the
federal
regulatory
scheme,
all
of
these
things
are
available
to
harmonize
the
public
policy
of
those
constitutional
provisions.
so,
in
conclusion
i'd
like
to
say
that
congress
did
strike
the
right
balance
when
it
enacted
the
section
106,
and
we
believe
that
our
interpretation
of
the
bankruptcy
clause
in
the
eleventh
amendment
is
the
proper
interpretation
of
section
106(c),
and
i
would
today
respectfully
request
you
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit.
