justice
scalia
but
why
would
you
need
106(a)
after
you
have
you
106(c)?
what
does
106(a)
cover
that
106(c)
wouldn't?
justice
scalia
assuming
you
read
106(c)
the
way
you
read
it?
justice
scalia
um-hum.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
but
you
wouldn't
need
a
waiver
if
you
have
a
mandatory
elimination
of
state
sovereign
immunity.
you
wouldn't
need
a
waiver.
i
mean,
why
have
a
waiver
provision
when
you
then
go
on
to
say
and
by
the
way,
whether
the
state
waives
or
not,
the
state
is
liable.
and
that's
what
you
tell
us
(c)
means.
justice
scalia
well,
i
understand
what
you're
saying,
but...
and...
and
maybe
you
give
me
an
explanation
for
why
it's
such
a
strange
statute,
but
it
still
is
a
very
strange
statute
that
you're...
that...
the
way
you're
asking
us
to
interpret
it.
you're
asking
us
to
interpret
this
as
saying
first,
if
the
state...
if
the
state
files
a
claim,
it
can
be
subject
to
liability
and
then,
second,
even
if
a
state
doesn't
file
a
claim,
it
can
be
subject
to
liability.
justice
scalia
well,
what
circumstance
is
covered
by
the
first
part
that
isn't
covered
by
the
second
part?
is
there
any
case
that's
covered
by
(a)
and
(b)
that
is
not
covered
by
(c)?
just
one?
justice
scalia
it
can't
be
unmistakably
clear,
if
only
because
of
the
first
phrase
with
which
the...
with
which
(c)
is
introduced
which,
as
far
as
i
can
ascertain,
is
utterly
meaningless.
can
you
possibly
tell
me
what
notwithstanding...
notwithstanding
(a)
and
(b)--
justice
scalia
--well--
justice
scalia
--but,
boy,
people
don't
talk
that
way.
when
you
say
notwithstanding,
you...
you
would
think
that
what...
that
what
(a)
and
(b)
would
be
saying
is
there
is
state
sovereign
immunity
and
then
when
you
would
say
notwithstanding
the
apparent
sovereign
immunity
under
(a)
and
(b),
there
is
no
sovereign
immunity
under
(c).
but,
in
fact,
(a)
and
(b)
do
not
provide
for
sovereign
immunity.
they
eliminate
sovereign
immunity.
so,
it
makes
no
sense
to
say
notwithstanding
the
elimination
of
sovereign
immunity
in
(a)
and
(b).
there
is
no
sovereign
immunity
under
(c).
that
is
really,
truly
gobbledygook.
justice
scalia
as
you
read
this
provision,
it
would
apply
even
if
you
couldn't
bring
suit
in
state
court.
you're
attributing
to
congress
the
intent
of
saying
that
even
if
a
businessman
has
entered
into
a
contract
with
the
state
that
he
knows
he's
not
going
to
be
able
to
recover
on
because
the
state
has
not
waived
its
sovereign
immunity,
he's
taking
his
chances.
maybe
he
gets,
you
know,
an
added
premium
for
taking
chances
like
that
or
whatever.
but
if
he's
lucky
enough
to
go
bankrupt,
then
his
creditors
are
going
to
be
able
to
sue
on
that
contract
even
though
the...
the
individual
himself
wouldn't
have
been
able
to.
justice
scalia
that's
a
strange
intent
to
attribute
to
congress.
justice
scalia
i
thought
you
just
did
take
a
position
on
it?
justice
scalia
i
thought
you
said
that
they
were
right
on
that
point.
on
the
constitutional
question.
i
must
have
misheard
you.
justice
scalia
oh.
justice
scalia
well,
if
you
have
no
explanation
for
that,
then...
then...
then
the
suggested
reading
you're
proposing
is
not
a
very
plausible
suggested
reading.
it
gives
a
nice
result,
but
i
don't
see
how
it
bears
any
relationship
to
the
language.
justice
scalia
would
your
interpretation
be
any
less
plausible
than
it
now
is
if
subsection
(1)
were
simply
totally
eliminated?
what
is...
what
does
subsection
(1)
add
that
you
would
need
to
arrive
at
your
interpretation?
could
you
just
read
subsection
(2)
and
get
your
interpretation?
justice
scalia
i
see.
justice
scalia
and
with
respect
to
those,
you
would
not
be
able
to...
your
theory
is
you
would
not
be
able
to
bind--
justice
scalia
--governmental.
justice
scalia
do
those
provisions
make
any
sense
from
a
policy
standpoint?
excluding
those
particular
provisions?
justice
scalia
yeah.
justice
scalia
mr.
merrill,
i
don't
suppose
you
have
any
more
explanation
than
anybody
else
of
the
magic
words,
"except
as
provided
in
subsections
(a)
and
(b)?
"
