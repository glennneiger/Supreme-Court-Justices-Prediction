mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
contends
that
section
106(c)
of
the
bankruptcy
code
authorizes
bankruptcy
courts
to
adjudicate
claims
for
retroactive
monetary
relief
against
non-consenting
governmental
units.
if
petitioner
is
right,
then
a
significant
question
of
constitutional
law
would
be
presented,
whether
the
congress
has
the
power
under
the
bankruptcy
clause
of
article
i
to
abrogate
a
state's
eleventh
amendment
immunity
in
this
particular
fashion.
it's
the
position
of
the
united
states
that
the
court
need
not
reach
this
constitutional
question.
in
our
view,
section
106(c)
waives
governmental...
sovereign
immunity
only
to
the
extent
of
allowing
government
units
to
be
bound
by
judgments
in
rem
concerning
the
preservation
or
distribution
of
assets
of
an
estate
in
bankruptcy.
but
that
section
does
not
authorize
suits
of
an
offensive
character
seeking
to
augment
the
assets
of
the
estate
by
recovering
money
from
governmental
units.
since
we
do
not
take
a
position
on
the
constitutional
question
presented,
i
will
focus
my
portion
of
the
argument
on
the
issues
of
statutory
construction.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
how
so?
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
no,
no.
our
position
is
that
the--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--the
court
can
avoid
reaching
the
constitutional
question
because
the
statute,
properly
construed,
does
not
waive
state
sovereign
immunity
for
actions
for
monetary
relief.
there's
no
question
but
that
section
106(c)
does
waive
sovereign
immunity.
both
subsection
(a)
and
subsection
(c)
specifically
refer
to
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity.
but
the
issue
before
the
court
is
not
whether
there
has...
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
but
rather
what
the
scope
of
that
waiver
is.
now,
though
we
think
that
cumulatively
the
waiver
in
section
106
is
a
broad
one,
it's
far
from
unlimited.
i
think
it's
useful
to
begin
by
looking
briefly
at
all
three
subsections
of
section
106(c).
subsections
(a)
and
(b)
both
concern
the
situation
where
a
governmental
unit
has
filed
a
claim
against
a...
a...
the
debtor
in
bankruptcy.
subsection
(a)
provides
that
when
a
governmental
unit
files
such
a
claim,
it
loses
its
sovereign
immunity
with
respect
to
any
claim
for
monetary
relief
that
rises...
arises
out
of
the
same
transaction
or
occurrence
underlying
the
government's
claim.
in
this
compulsory
counterclaim
situation,
the
waiver
is
unlimited.
there's
no
cap
on
the
size
of
the
affirmative
relief
that
can
be
obtained
against
a
sovereign
entity.
subsection
(b)
provides
that
when
a
governmental
unit
files
a
claim,
there
may
be
offset
against
that
claim
any
type
of
claim
that
the
debtor
in
possession
or
the
trustee
may
have
against
the
government.
in
this
permissive
counterclaim
situation,
there's
no
limit
on
the
source
of
the
cause
of
action.
it
doesn't
have
to
rise
out
of
the
same
transactional
occurrence,
but
the
offset
is
capped
by
the
amount
of
the
government's
recovery.
it
cannot
exceed
the
amount
that
the
government
is
eventually
held
to
be
entitled
to...
to
get
from
the
bankrupt
estate.
subsection
(c),
which
is
in
issue
here,
was
added
to
the
1978
bankruptcy
code
at
the
last
minute
by
the
conference
committee.
we
freely
concede
that
it's
not
a
model
of
clarity.
but,
in
our
view,
it
was
not
designed
to
deal
with
the
problem
that
subsections
(a)
and
(b)
are
designed
to
deal
with,
which
is
monetary
recovery
from
the
government.
rather,
it
was
simply
intended
to
make
clear
that
the
government
is
bound
by
a
judgment,
a
declaratory-type
judgment,
in
the
nature
of
an
in
rem
proceeding
involving
the
rights
of
the
entire
world
to
the
assets
of
the
bankrupt.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
well,
a
good
example
would
be
your
typical
discharge
situation,
which
can
occur
under
a
variety
of
sections
of
the
code.
if
the
government
has
not
filed
a
claim
but
is
listed
as
a
creditor,
and
you
get
to
the
end
of
the
proceedings
and
the
discharge
order
is
issued,
the
government
is
bound
by
that.
they
cannot
deny
it
and
proceed
to
recover.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
well,
i--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--that's
my
understanding,
justice
white,
yes.
and
if
a
listed
creditor
receives
notice
and
does
nothing
to
try
to
assert
that
claim--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--but
if
it's
disallowed,
then
the
creditor
has
not
asserted
any
rights--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--at
the
end
of
the
proceeding
the
discharge
order
is
entered
and
that
creditor
is
bound.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
what
106(c)
is
saying,
in
effect,
is
that
when
the
government's
in
that
situation,
it's
bound.
another
example
would
be
a
determination
of
tax
liability
under
section
505.
bankruptcy
courts
are
allowed
to...
are
authorized
by
that
section
to
determine
to
what
extent
a
tax
claim
that
may
exist
is
valid
or
invalid.
if
the
government
doesn't
file
a
claim,
but
nevertheless
an
issue
arises
about
tax
liability,
then
the
bankruptcy
court
is
authorized
to
determine
that
issue
and
the
government
would
be
bound
by
it.
that
was
the
situation
in
the
gwilliam
case
and
the
dolard
cases
out
of
the
ninth
circuit,
which
the
legislative
history
suggests
were
the
precise
reason
or
the
primary
motivation
that
congress
had.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
yes,
they're
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
i
have
no
explanation
for
that,
justice
scalia.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
i
don't
think
so,
justice
scalia.
i
think
if
you
look
at
subsection
(c)
it
contains
two
subparts,
(1)
and
(2),
and
they're
joined
by
the
word
"and"
which
ordinarily
is
thought
to
be
conjunctive
rather
than
disjunctive.
the
petitioner's
argument
essentially
in
this
case
is
that
the
two
stand
alone
and
that
subsection
(1)
of
subsection
(c)
authorizes
actions
against
governmental
units
anytime
one
of
those
three
words
happens
to
appear
in
a
provision
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
our...
our
position
is
that
you
have
to
read
the
two
of
them
together
and
that
subsection
(1)
is
quite
sweeping.
it
sweeps
within
its
compass
a
very
large
number
of
code
provisions.
we
did
a
computer
check
preparing
for
this
argument
and
discovered
that
over
100
provisions
of
the
code
use
the
word
"creditor".
so,
subsection
(1)
is
very
sweeping,
but
then
it's
also
limited
by
subsection
(2)
which
says
that
a
determination
by
a
court
of
an
issue
arising
under
such
provision
binds
governmental
units.
we
think
both
subsections
have
to
be
satisfied,
and
the
language
of
the
second
subsection
quite
clearly
suggests
declaratory
relief,
determinations
of...
of
the
rights
of
the
world
with
respect
to
the
assets
that
are
before
the
bankruptcy
court,
whether
or
not
they
have
filed
a
claim.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
well,
there
are
some
subsections
that
do
not
contain
one
of
the
triggering
words.
there
are
some
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
codes.
one
of
the
problems
is
understanding
exactly
what
the
word
provision
means.
but
there
are
sections
of
the
code--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--and
subsections
of
the
code
that
do
not
contain
these
three
words.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
that's
correct.
to
give
you
one
example
which--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--i'm
not
sure
whether
it
makes
sense
to...
i
mean,
the
list
of
ones
that
are
included
or
the
ones
that
are
excluded,
i'm
not
sure
it
make
a
lot
of
sense.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
we
have
not
gone
through
and
read
every
single
section
of
the
code
that
contains
one
of
these
triggering
words.
there
are
like
65
that
contain
the
work
"entity",
and
it
goes
on
and
on.
i
can
give
you
one
example,
though.
it's...
it's
not
an
issue
presented
in
this
particular
case,
but
the
automatic
stay
provision
of
section
362
contains
a
triggering
word,
and
we
concede
that
that
is
a
provision
that...
that
affects
and
binds...
binds
the
government
because
the
automatic
stay
is
essentially
preserving
the
assets
of
the
bankrupt
estate
in
an
in
rem
sort
of
fashion.
but,
in
1984
i
believe
it
was
congress
amended
that
by
adding
a
new
provision,
subsection
(h),
which
authorizes
money
damages
for
violating
automatic
stay.
well,
subsection
(h)
does
not
contain
a
triggering
word.
so,
it
might
be
our
position
in
a
case,
for
example,
that
that's
a
separate
provision,
doesn't
contain
a
triggering
word
and,
therefore,
you
don't
even
have
to
get
to
the
question
of
subpart
(2)
because
subpart
(1)
is
not
satisfied.
i
think
one
of
the
most
significant
things
about
the
language
of
106(c)
and
in
coming
to
a
determination
of
its
meaning
is
what
it
does
not
say.
subsection
(c)
uses
none
of
the
words
that
we
generally
associate
with
monetary
relief.
there's
no
reference
to
the
word
"money".
there's
no
reference
to
"monetary"--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--sure.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
i
think
you're
right,
justice
stevens.
if
all
you
had
was
subpart
(1)
and
you
just
incorporated--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--that's
right.
if...
if
you...
if
you
go
through
the
process
of
incorporation
by
reference,
you
can
find
references
to
monetary
relief.
but
when
congress
was
thinking
about
sovereign
immunity,
i
mean,
section
106
was
where
it
was
thinking
about
sovereign
immunity.
i
don't
think
there's
any
suggestion
that...
that
there
was
a
careful
review
of
all
the
subsections
that
would
be
triggered
here
and
in
the
subsection
where
they're
speaking
about
sovereign
immunity
under
subsection
(c),
they
don't
say
anything
about
money
damages
as
contrasted
with--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--well,
(a)
and
(b)
use
the
word
"claim".
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
and
the
word
"claim"
is
defined
by
the
bankruptcy
code
as
a
right
to
payment.
and
the
significant
language
in
both
(a)
and
(b)
refers
to
a
claim
against
a
governmental
unit
that
is
the
property
of
the
estate.
in
other
words,
a
right
to
demand
the
payment
of
money
from
the
government.
so,
(a)
and
(b)
are
clearly
talking
about
that
situation.
the
word
(c),
and
we
think
that
that,
at
least
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
lends
some
credence
to
the...
to
our
petition.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
but
not
only
is
the
word
claim
difficult
to
introduce,
but
any
language
that
suggests
an
in
personam
type
action
is
difficult
to
introduce
in
subsection
(c).
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
we
think
it
can
be
both.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
well,
no.
we
think
the
basic
distinction
is
a
sound
one
and
is
fully
supported
by
the
language
of
section
106(c).
we
think
that
perhaps
in
the
application
of
the
distinction
there
would
be
situations
where
there
could
be
disputes.
but
with
respect
of
preference
avoidance,
we
think
that,
for
example,
the
situation
in
the
whiting
pools
case
where
you
had
tangible
property,
trucks
and
vehicles
and
sort...
and
so
forth,
as
to
which
title
belonged
to
the
debtor,
but
possession
had
been
taken
over
by
the
federal
government,
the
irs,
in
anticipation
of
satisfying
a
tax
lien,
that
that
would
be
a
type
of
situation
where
the
property
is
still
within
the
custody,
so
to
speak,
of
the
bankruptcy
court
and
you
could
avoid
that
as
a
preferential
transfer
in
that
situation,
but
we
don't
think
that
the
language
can
be
extended
so
far
as
to
include
recovery
of
money
damages
or
cash.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
well,
we
think
that
that
would
fall
under
the...
the
retroactive
monetary
relief
side
of
the
line
rather
than
the
in
rem
side
of
the
line.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
i
don't
have
a
great
explanation
for
that,
justice
scalia.
it
does
seem
to
me,
though,
that
if
you
start
with
(c)...
and
this
would
not
be
the
natural
way
to
read
through
the
whole
section...
but
if
you
start
with
(c)
and
realize
that
congress
was
thinking
about
a
limited
waiver
with
respect
only
to
declaratory
relief
to
rights
and
the
assets
of
the
estate,
when
it
would
make
sense
to
say
that
except
as
provided
in
subparts
(a)
and
(b)
which
authorize
recovery
of
money
damages
in
the
situation
where
there's
been
a
proof
of
claim.
so,
i
think
if
that's
what
was
going
on
in
the
minds
of
the
draftsmen,
perhaps
it
makes
a
certain
amount...
amount
of
sense.
the
big
point
here,
though,
i
think
is
that
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
we
advance
i
think
is
supported
by
the
language.
it's
supported
by
the
legislative
history.
it's
supported
by
the
canons
of
construction
that
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity
are
supposed
to
be
construed
narrowly
if
possible.
and
the
mere
fact
that
there
is,
as
the
second
circuit,
i
think
demonstrated,
a
credible
interpretation
that
does
not
support
petitioner's
contention,
suggests
that
congress
does
not
clearly
waive
the
sovereign
immunity
of
either
the
states
or
the
federal
government
under
this
particular
statute.
thank
you.
