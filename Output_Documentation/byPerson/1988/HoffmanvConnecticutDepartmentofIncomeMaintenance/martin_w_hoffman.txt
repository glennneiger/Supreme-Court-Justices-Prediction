mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
issue
before
the
court
this
afternoon
is
whether
or
not
the
unmistakably
clear
language
in
106(c)
of
the
bankruptcy
code
waives
eleventh
amendment
immunity
from
suit
in
the
federal
court
when
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy
has
brought
a
cause
of
action
under
title
11
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
542(b),
547(b)
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
seeking
to
collect
retroactive
monetary
damages
from
the
state
of
connecticut,
and
whether
or
not
article
i,
section
8,
clause
4
and
18
of
the
constitution
would
abrogate
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
i
was
appointed
trustee
in
both
of
these
cases,
your
honors,
and
in
both
of
these
cases
as
trustee,
i
analyzed
the
cases
to
see
what
assets
were
available
or
that
should
be
liquidated
by
the
trustee
in
these
proceedings.
in
the
case
of
in
re
willington,
since
this
was
two
unrelated
bankruptcy
cases
that
were
combined
as
one
case
in
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals,
there
was
a
cause
of
action
against
the
state
of
connecticut
which
had
filed
a
chapter...
which
for
$64,000
for
unpaid
monies
due
and
owing
to
the
estate
as
a
result
of
services
performed
by
willington,
a
debtor
in
possession
in
a
chapter
11
proceedings.
that
case
was
voluntarily...
it
was
voluntarily
changed
to
a
chapter
7
proceedings
by
the
debtor
in
possession.
and
as
trustee,
i
brought
a
cause
of
action
under
542(b),
11
u.s.c.
542(b)
of
the
bankruptcy
code
seeking
to
recover
from
an
entity
that
had
received...
received
services,
the
payment
of
money
from
that
entity
to
the
trustee.
in
the
case
of
zera,
in
re
zera,
mr.
zera
was
running
a
small
lawn
maintenance
business
and
just
a
few
days
prior
to
his
filing
a
bankruptcy
proceedings,
the
state
recovered
$2,000
by
means
of
a
preferential
transfer.
in
that
case
i
made
demand
upon
the
state
to
collect
the
preference
payment.
again,
i
was
refused,
and
as
trustee
i
brought
a
cause
of
action
in
accordance
with
11
u.s.c.
547(b)
and
558.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
i
brought
both
of
these
actions,
your
honor,
in
the
bankruptcy
court.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
before
the
honorable
judge
krechevsky.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
the
bankruptcy
judge.
and
in
both
of
these
cases,
these
suits
were
brought
under
the
authority
of
28
u.s.c.
1334(b)
and
28
u.s.c.
157,
which
would
allow
the
bankruptcy
court
as
an
adjunct
of
the
district
court
to
hear
both
of
these
cases,
your
honor.
in
both
of
these
cases
the
court...
the
state
of
connecticut
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
which
was
denied
by
the
bank...
raising
a
defense
of
sovereign
immunity,
and
in
both
of
these
cases,
the
court
found...
denied
the
state's
motion.
the
proceedings
were
appealed
by
the
state
of
connecticut
in
both
cases
to
the
district
court
in
connecticut,
which
found
against
the
trustee.
i
took
an
appeal
to
the
second
circuit
of
appeals...
sixth...
second
circuit
court
of
appeals...
which
sustained
the
district
court
and
basically...
since
this
case
is
in
conflict
with
a
seventh
circuit
case,
in
re:
mcvey,
we
are
here
today
arguing
these
motions.
the
clear
language
of
106
is
basically
the
starting
point,
i
believe,
for
the
argument.
when
congress
enacted
the
bankruptcy
code
in
1978
by
means
of
a...
passing
the
bankruptcy
reform
act,
what
it
basically
did
was
overhaul,
change,
codify
the
bankruptcy
act
of
1898,
which
had
been
in
existence
up
until
that
time.
the
bankruptcy...
i
mean
the...
congress
in
1965
basically
started
working
on
changing
the
bankruptcy
act.
it
took
them
approximately...
i
mentioned
1968
because
it
took
them
approximately
10
years
to
enact
the
bankruptcy
reform
act
of
1978.
one
of
the
sections
that
they
dealt
with
was
106
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
it
seemed
that
they
worked
on
106
over
a
long
period
of
time
because
at
the
beginning
they
were
only
dealing
with
106(a)
and
(b).
that
was
a
situation
where
they
knew
that...
they
had
106(a)
and
106(b),
and
they
came
up
with
a
conclusion
that
the
state
by
filing
a
proof
of
claim
in
the
bankruptcy
court
asking
for
something
from
the
court,
acknowledging
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
by
filing
a
proof
of
claim,
therefore,
they
would
waive
their
sovereign
immunity
claim,
and
they
would
give
the
court
the
jurisdiction
to,
in
106(a),
utilize
the...
by
means
of
a
compulsory
counterclaim
the
ability
of
a
debtor
or
a
trustee
to
recover
retrospective
monetary
damages
from
the
state.
that
is,
if
the
state
filed
a
proof
claim
alleging
there
was
$100
owed
to
it
under
a
contract
and
the
trustee
under
that
same
contract
or
debtor
in
possession
or
debtor
had
a
claim
for
$1,000,
that
by
means
of
a
compulsory
counterclaim
the
estate
or
the
debtor
would
collect
$900.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
no,
they
couldn't...
they
could
not
do
anything
unless
they
filed
a
voluntary...
voluntary
proof
of
claim
in
accordance
with
106(a)
and
(b).
they
couldn't
do
it.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
106(a)--
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
--the
way
i
read
it.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
well,
106(a)
and
(b)
cover
those
situations
where...
one
of
the
two
ways
that
the
state
can
obviously
be
brought
before
the
court
is
one
is
to
waive
their
jurisdiction
and
file
a
proof
of
claim,
which
they
would
do
under
(a)
and
(b).
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
but,
as
i'm
here
today,
they
didn't
do
it
under
(a)
and
(b).
that's
why
(c)
was
put
in,
to
put
in
those
situations
where
they
don't
do
it.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
i
think
that
what
happened
was
because
the
way
the
code
section
was
codified
and
the
way
congress
worked
at
it,
they
had
(a)
and
(b)
and
they
had
worked
on
it,
and
then
they
came
to
the
situation
where
in
the...
except
where
they
file
a
proof
of
claim,
where
they
don't
file
a
proof
of
claim
and
not
assuming
their...
not
withstanding
their...
their...
their...
they're
assuming
that
they...
they
have
sovereign
immunity...
not
over...
i'm
sorry...
not
withstanding
any
assertion
of
sovereign
immunity
that
they're...
they
would
still...
the
trustee
would
have
the
opportunity
to
sue
the
state
as
long
as
it's
under
those
certain
situations
that
they
give
it
to
them
because--
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
--only
under
certain
circumstances,
though,
justice
scalia.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
well,
as
i
have
stated
in
my
brief,
i've
said
that
there
are
certain
circumstances
where
there's
lien
avoidance,
post-petition
claims
that
in
those
particular
circumstances
that
the
state
would
not
be
bound
unless
they
filed
proof
of
claim.
they
would
have
to
file
a
proof
claim.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
if
the--
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
no.
what
the...
what
the
procedure
that
in
willington,
as
an
example,
and
that
was
a
chapter
11
proceedings...
it
was
a
business.
they
carried
on
a
business.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
and
they
provided
services.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
they
went
out
and
they
gave
services
to
the
state,
and
people--
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
--no,
they
have
to
file
a
proof
of
claim.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
unless
it's...
no.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
if
the
state...
if
the
estate
owes
an
administrative
claim,
yes,
we
do
pay
them.
if
the...
if
a
creditor
does
not
file
a
proof
of
claim
it
does...
in
a
bankruptcy
proceeding...
it
does
not
share
in
the
distribution.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
a
creditor...
a
creditor
that
has
secured
property,
your
honor,
if
his
property
is
liquidated
by
the
trustee,
liquidated
by
the
trustee,
then
the
lien...
a
lien
as
to
the
assets
will
attach,
and
he
will
get
that
money
if
he's
entitled
to
it.
but
if
the
property
is
taken
back...
taken
back
by
the
secured
party,
he
must
file
a
claim
as
any
other
creditor,
or
else
he
won't
share
in
the
estate.
the
clear
language
in
my
reading
of
106(c)
is
that
first
of
all
that
you
have
to
read
the
whole
bankruptcy...
the
bankruptcy
code
as
a
whole.
if
you
just
read
106(c),
it's
difficult
to
interpret
it
the
way
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
mcvey
case
read
it,
and
the
way
that
i
have
proposed
it.
the
wording
in
(c)
is
"except
as
provided
in
subsection
(a)
and
(b)
of
the
section,
of
this
section,
and
notwithstanding
any
assertion
of
sovereign
immunity.
"
now,
i
know
that
the
wording
goes
on
further
to
say,
one,
"a
provision
of
this
title
that
contains
creditor,
entity
or
governmental
unit
applies
to
governmental
units.
"
and,
two,
"a
determination
by
the
court
of
an
issue
arising
under
such
a
provision
binds
the
governmental
unit...
units.
"
each
word
in
analysis,
when
one
takes
into
consideration
the
bankruptcy
code
as
a
whole,
does
show
the
clear,
unmistakably
clear
intent
of
cong...
of
congress
to
show
its
intent
to
waive
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
no
matter
what
they...
oh,
i'm
sorry.
but
my
reading
is
that
no
matter
what
their
claim
is,
they
can't
claim
sovereign
immunity
under
(c)
when
there
are
three...
when
there...
when
you
go
to
the
trigger
words
which
identify--
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
--the
code
sections.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
well,
except
that
it
took...
it
took
congress
10
years
to
write
106(c).
[laughter]
and
it
took
them
five
years
to
come
up
with
106(a)
and
(b)
and
another
five
years
to
come
up
with
(c).
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
your
honor,
it's
true,
though,
but
congress
is
still
changing
and
correcting
the
bankruptcy
code
and
making
it
more
clear.
obviously,
it's
going
along.
but
i
think
this
clearly
meets
the
test,
the
clear
test
to
show
their
intent,
their
clear
intent
to
do
this
under
those
specific
code
sections
that
involve
their
intention.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
well,
the
reason
it
is
wrong...
i
mean,
not...
the
reason
that
i
take...
i
object...
i
say
that
it's
different
the
way
that
i
interpret
it,
the
way
the
seventh
circuit
interprets
it
is
because
i
look
at
creditor,
entity
and
governmental
unit
as
the
words...
i
read
the
bankruptcy
code
as
a
whole,
and
they
tell
me
to
go
to
542(b)
to
547(b)
and
550(a),
which
tell
me
that
i
can
recover
a
monetary
judgment
against
the
state.
and
i
can
do
it
if
article
i
of
the
constitution,
the
bankruptcy
clause
abrogates
the
eleventh
amendment.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
i
do
as
it
encompasses
the
code
as
a
whole.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
what
it
means,
your
honor,
is
that
if
there
is
a
word
in
this
statute
542(b)
which
has
that
word
in
there,
and
i
can
utilize
that
because
all
this
says
is
that
sovereign
immunity
is
waived
in
those
code
sections
such
as
542(b)
which
has
the
word
entity
and
says
that
i
can
collect
a
monetary
debt.
the
reading
of
these
three
statutes
here
that...
the
reading
of
the
three
statutes
that
deal
with
preferences,
that
deal
with
collection
or
recovery
of
a
debt
for
money
owed
to
the
estate
would
also...
and
if
the
clear
language
of
that...
of
the
statutes
unmistakably
shows
congressional
intent
to
waive
sovereign
immunity,
the
question,
then,
is
whether
or
not
the
court
will
find
that
the
plenary
powers
under
article
i,
section
8,
clause
18
do
abrogate
or
does
abrogate
the
eleventh
amendment
under
the...
when
one
is
utilizing
the
bankruptcy
court
and...
but
only
under
those
specific
code
sections
that
apply.
now--
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
--yes.
as
i
said,
there's
545
and
there's
549
that
i've
quoted
in
my
brief.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
540...
545,
549,
unless
they
file
a
proof
of
claim,
it
wouldn't
apply.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
i
think
that
what
congress...
yes,
justice
stevens.
i
think
that
what
the
congress
in
the
legislative
history
was
trying
to
show
was
that
they
have,
probably,
difficulty
as
we
can
see
with
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
under
the
bankruptcy
clause.
but
in
order
to
come
about
and
recognize
that
in
1988
or
1989...
last
year
there
were
600,000
bankruptcy
cases
filed
in
the
united
states,
and
of
those
approximately
68,000
were
business
bankruptcies.
you're
going
to
have
the
state
and
you're
going
to
have
the
federal
government,
you're
going
to
have
them
involved
in
a
great
majority,
a
great
majority
if
not
in
excess
of
90,
95
percent
or
more
in
the
business
bankruptcies,
and
there's
no
question
in
my
mind
about
that.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
it
did
not.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
yes.
the
court
of
appeals
basically...
that'
correct,
your
honor.
but
the
court
of
appeals
basically
said
yes,
it's
partially...
partially...
under
certain
circumstances
where
you're
looking
for
injunctive
or
declaratory
relief,
but
the...
they
sort
of
limit
it.
they
gave
me
a
quarter
of
a
loaf
maybe,
i
would
say.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
but--
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
--well,
as
it...
well,
i'm
looking
at
the
aspect
of
the
chapter
11.
i'm
looking
at
willington,
i'm
looking
at
the
people
that
provided
the
electricity,
the
purveyors.
everybody
went
out
there
and
they
said
okay,
look.
come
to
work
with
us.
we're
providing
services
to
these
title
19
medicaid
patients.
we're
going
to
get
paid
from
the
state
of
connecticut.
you
don't
have
to
worry.
even
if
this
is
converted
to
a
chapter
7,
it
doesn't
matter
because
the
$65,000
or
$4,000
that
the
state
owes,
they'll
pay
it
to
us
and,
therefore,
you'll
get
your
share
as
an
administrative
expense.
and,
therefore...
and...
and...
and
if...
and
that
is...
that
is
the
congressional
scheme,
i
think.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
that's
correct.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
that's
correct.
i
could
have
done
that,
too,
that's
correct.
but
the
congressional
scheme...
i...
the
congressional
scheme
in
my...
and
what
i
would
say
would
be
uniform
decisions,
expediency,
waste
of
judicial
time,
waste
of
having...
they
could
also
have
50
different
bankruptcy
codes
in
the
state,
too.
you
don't
have
to
have
federal
bankruptcy
court.
you
could
have
50
separate
little
bankruptcy
courts
throughout
the
state.
when
they
conflict
with
the
federal
court,
that's
a
different
question.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
well,
the--
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
--well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
the...
the
nature
of
the
bankruptcy
code
is
to...
to
give
an
even
distribution
of
assets
to
the
creditors,
not
to
the
debtor,
but
to
the
creditors,
those
people
that
are
owed
money
by
the
bankrupt
estate.
the
state
of
connecticut's
a
creditor
in
this
case,
too.
they're
a
creditor.
the
federal
government's
a
creditor
in
this
case,
too.
they're
both
owed
taxes.
they
could
have
received
money
if...
they
could
have
received
money
in
order
of
priority
if
they're
owed
these
proper
taxes.
but
when
they
have
an
unsecured
debt
here,
a
debt
which
is
owed
to
the
chapter
11
debtor
in
possession
and
then
when
it's
converted
to
a
7,
the
trustee
comes
in
and
tries
to
collect.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
that
is
correct.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
they
don't.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
it's
not
me,
justice
rehnquist.
i'm
doing
this
on
accordance
to
enforce
the
code
section.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
my
name's
on
it.
that's
all
there
is.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
that's
correct.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
it
does
defeat
the
bankruptcy
scheme.
it
does...
i
mean,
if
you've
got
250
judges
out
there
that
are
administering
600,000
cases
or
maybe
a
few
more
or
less...
i'm
not
sure
about
the
number...
and
it
seems
to
me
that...
that
when
one
looks
at
the
picture
xx
a
whole
that
it
would
be
that
the
clear
intent
has
been
shown.
and...
and
i'd
like
to
discuss
article
i,
the
constitutional
issue,
because
i
feel
that
the
constitutional
issue
should
be
raised
if
the
court
finds
the
unmistakable
language
is
clear,
is
that
when
the
states
ratified
the
constitution,
they
did
give
up
certain
power,
they
did
give
certain
powers
to
congress,
and
they
did
give
the
power
to
congress
under
article
i,
section
8,
clause
4,
to
establish
bankruptcy
laws,
to
establish
it.
and,
under
18
they
said
you
make
the
laws
to
pass
those...
to
make
those
laws
be
enforceable.
and
so,
title
xi
is
the
bankruptcy
law
and
28
u.s.c.
1334
and
157
give
the
jurisdiction
to
the
bankruptcy
court,
not
only
to
take
this
matter
but
to
hear
it
and
to
decide
it.
i'd
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
i
have
left.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
no.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
yes,
i
do.
i
think
if
we...
i
think
the...
that
the
court...
this
is
still
1989,
that
there
are
many
large
chapter
11s
that
are
in
existence
throughout
the
united
states.
if
you
follow...
this
is
more
than
just
collecting
a
debt
and
collecting
a
preference.
it's
whether
or
not
the
congressional
scheme
to
have
a
bankruptcy
code
that's
effective
throughout
the
united
states
and
it
is
carried
on
in
the
federal
court,
the
district
court,
the
bankruptcy
court
is
an
adjunct
of
the...
of
the
bankrupt...
of
the
district
court
that
one
must
expand.
this
is
a
special
situation.
this
is
a
situation
where
if
you're
going
to
have
a
super-creditor,
if
you're
going
to
have
a
state,
if
you're
going
to
have
a
federal
government
that
can
do
whatever
it
wants
and
then
say
well,
the
court
can
determine
what
we
owe--
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
--the
chandler
act
was
in
1938.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
and
that
was--
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
--that's
right...
correct,
your
honor.
it
took...
that
is
absolutely
correct.
that
was
the
way
it
was,
and
it
took
10
years
for
them
to
decide
it
and,
in
fact,
106(a)
and
(b)
was
five
years
before
(c),
so
it
took
them
another
five
years
to
come
up
with
that.
and
to
answer
your
questions
about
creditors,
your
honor,
a
trustee
does
list
creditors
in
a
chapter
11.
they
don't
have
to
file
a
proof
of
claim.
only
in
a
chapter
7.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
they
are
allowed
in
a
chapter
11.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
unless
the
trustee
objects
to
it.
mr.
martin
w.
hoffman
it's
a
footnote,
your
honor,
which...
it's
a
little
footnote
that
says
545
and
545(a).
but
there's
an
amicus
brief
by
in
re
inslaw
which
goes
into
it
in
much
greater
detail.
i
might
say
that.
in
addition
to
the...
the
specific
language
of
the
statute,
senator
diconcini
in
his
remarks
when
106(c)
was
eventually
enacted
clearly
said
you
could
look...
you
can
go
after
preferences.
i
mean,
there
can't
be
any
clearer
words
in
the
legislative
history.
he
takes
the
situation
and
says
here's
a
special...
here's
a
situation
where
i'm
telling
you
you
can
go
after
it.
not...
and
he
also
has
words
in
it
that
it
says
there's
other
situations,
too.
now,
the...
the
case
of
fitzpatrick
versus
bitzer
does
deal
with
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
certainly
there
is
nothing
that
has
dealt
with
the
article
i,
section...
with
the
bankruptcy
clause.
but
then,
again,
this
code
section
has
only
been
in
existence
for
10
years,
and
prior
to
that
it
would
not
have
come
up.
but
i
say
this,
with
the
vast
scheme
that
congress
is
looking
to...
after
all,
we
have
our
senators,
representatives.
they
can
decide
whether
or
not
they
want
a
bankruptcy
code,
whether
or
not
they
should
have
all
the
creditors
be
involved,
whether
or
not
one
creditor
can
stand
aside
and
say
yes,
you
can
determine
what
we
owe,
but
there's
no
way
you
can
ever
collect
it.
as
an
example,
in
the
eastern
case,
if
the
state
is
owed
money,
there's
nothing
to
stop
them
from
going
after
it.
