justice
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one
other
question.
you
say
only
under
the
specific
code
sections,
those
that
contain
any
one
of
the
three
triggering
words,
"creditor",
"entity",
or
"governmental
unit".
but
just
to
follow
up
on
justice
scalia's
point...
i'm
not
sure
you've
completely
answered
it...
are
there
sections
of
the
code
which
do
not
contain
any
of
the
three
triggering
words,
pursuant
to
which
a
state
might
file
some
kind
of
a
claim
and
an
issue
might
arise
where
they
would
be
no
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity?
justice
stevens
so,
your
point
is
that
(a)
and
(b)
apply
to
545
and
549,
but
do
not
apply
to
542
or
some
of
the
others
that
have
these
triggering
words
in
them?
justice
stevens
so
that
the...
your
answer,
then,
to
justice
scalia
is
that...
is
just
that
it
depends
on
what
the
particular
section...
whether
the
particular
section
contains
the
triggering
word
or
not?
justice
stevens
yes,
but,
mr.
merrill,
may
i
interrupt
you
right
on
that
point?
justice
stevens
if
you
incorporate
by
reference
the
sections
that
contain
those
words,
you
do
incorporate
547(c),
which
talks
about
transfers
that
are
avoidable
as
preferences.
there's
no
reference
to
money
in
there,
but
if
you
just
read
it
literally,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
termination
order
that
section
is
binding
on
the
entity,
which
is
the
governmental
entity,
and
the
determination
is
you've
got
to
give
the
money
back
or
the
property
back,
whatever
it
is.
it
doesn't
list
it
in
dollars.
why
doesn't
it
just
literally
just
read
on
that
case?
justice
stevens
on
subpart
(2)
it
gives
you
the
consequence
of
it,
namely
the
determination
pursuant
to
this
section
is
binding.
this
tells
you
what
it
means
to
have
it.
justice
stevens
they
don't
in
(a)
or
(b)
either.
they
don't
in--
justice
stevens
--well,
i
understand
that.
justice
stevens
i
don't
know
how
you
would
introduce
the
word
claim
in
it
the
way
they've
done
it.
if
there
is
some
sense...
and
i
don't
know
whether
there
is
or
not...
they're
saying
some
sections...
you...
you
treat
the
entity
as
a
governmental
entity
and
some
you
don't
and
they
have
a
formula
for
doing
it.
you
just
say
we
don't
follow
the
formula.
justice
stevens
is
setting
aside
a
voidable
preference
an
in
personam
or
an
in
rem
transaction?
justice
stevens
well,
then
haven't
you
given
your
distinction
away?
justice
stevens
or
recovery
of
monetary
preferences?
what
if
it's
a
preference
in
paying
a
bill
or
something?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
at
that
point
you
think
the
eleventh
amendment
applies
both
to
the
exercise
of
article
iii
jurisdiction
by
courts
and
also
the
article
i
jurisdiction
by
courts
that
are
created
pursuant
to
article
i?
justice
stevens
you
do.
the
words
"judicial
power"
in
the
eleventh
amendment
you
think
apply
to
both
of
those
situations?
