h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
now
in
number
88-412,
martin
hoffman
versus
connecticut
department
of
income
maintenance.
mr.
hoffman.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
about
a
creditor
in
possession
of
a
secured
in...
a
secured
property?
do
you
not
pay
them
something?
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
it
would
have
been
better
if
they
had
done
it
in
a
shorter
time?
[laughter]
it
wouldn't
have
been
so
weird
then.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
isn't
the
second
circuit's
reading
and
the
district
court
of
connecticut's
reading
just
as
plausible
as
yours,
that
(a)
and
(b)
waive
sovereign
immunity
when
the
state
files
a
claim.
but
if
the
state
doesn't
file
a
claim,
then
sovereign
immunity
is
not
waived.
it's
just...
the
state
is
simply
bound
by
certain
kinds
of
adjudication.
what
is
wrong
with
that
reading?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
you
don't
rely
on
the
specific
language,
then,
of
section
106?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
does
that
mean?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
if
they
try...
if
they
file
a
claim,
you
have
them
under
section
(a)
and
(b),
don't
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
how
do
they
get
their
tax
claim
paid
without
filing
a
claim?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
then,
aren't
you
out...
you're
actually
going
to
be
able
to
get
your...
what
you
regard
as
your
just
deserts...
just
deserts?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it's
bigger
than
both
of
us.
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hoffman.
mr.
merrill.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
merrill.
mrs.
riddle.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hoffman.
the
case
is
submitted.
