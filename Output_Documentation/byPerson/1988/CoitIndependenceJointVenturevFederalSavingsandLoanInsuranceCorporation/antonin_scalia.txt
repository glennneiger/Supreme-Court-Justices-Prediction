justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
that
you
would
have
no
judicial
remedy
for
that
foreclosure?
justice
antonin
scalia
being...
being
deprived
of
your
property
by
foreclosure
is
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
not
an
added
threat
unless
you
miss
the
five
days.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
it
doesn't
require
deferring,
but
it
cuts
it
off.
i
mean,
suppose
if
you
don't
file,
you
can't
bring
a
suit...
you
can't
bring
a
suit
in
court,
state
or
federal.
you
wouldn't
like
that.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
but
once
you
file,
you
can
sue
as
soon
as
you
like.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
think
we
can't
rule
for
you
and...
and
have
that
regime.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
really
all
or
nothing...
nothing
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you...
do
you
mean,
mr.
goodfriend,
if
there's
a
statute
that
says
the
secretary
can
make
a
particular
determination...
that's
all
the
statute
says...
the
agency
can't...
doesn't...
and
the
agency
has
rulemaking
authority,
just
general
rulemaking
authority,
the
agency
cannot
devise
a...
a
system
by
which
that
determination
will
be
made
which
requires
the
applicant
to
apply
first
to
one
level
with
an
appeal
to
a
second
level--
justice
antonin
scalia
--with
an
appeal
to
a
third
level?
and
you...
you
think
we
wouldn't
hold
that
he
had
to
exhaust?
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
not
fighting
about
that
anymore
i
thought.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
right
to
get
it
determined
in
court.
i
gather
that
has
been
conceded.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
only
issue
is
whether
that
includes
the
power
to
cut
off
a
claim.
do
you
think
that
language
fairly
includes
the
power
to
cut
off
a
claim
is
what
we're
talking
about--
justice
antonin
scalia
--aren't
you...
aren't
you
claiming
that
if...
if...
if
a
claim
is
not
presented
timely
to
fslic,
the
claim
is
cut
off?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
to
be
sure.
but...
but
the
power
you're
asserting
is
the
right...
is
the
power
to
cut
off
a
claim
if
they
don't
do
what
you
tell
them
to
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
under
the
social
security
act,
the
claimant
must
establish
his
claim
before
the
social
security
administration.
you
have
conceded
that
the
claimant
does
not
have
to
establish
his
claim
before
fslic.
he's
entitled
to
establish
it
before
the
courts.
i
there
find
it...
i,
therefore,
find
it
hard
to
imply
a
power
on
the
part
of
fslic
simply
to
chop
that
claim
away
if
this
individual
doesn't
follow
what
fslic
wants,
or
at
least
i...
you
know,
it
seems
to
me
there
ought
to
be
more
specific
language
in
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
would
it
do
that?
i
mean,
it's--
[laughter]
it's
the
person
owing
the
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
some
people
may
have
settled
because
they're
worn
down
not
being
able
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--go
into
state
court.
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
mr.
minear,
i
can
see
how
it's
necessary
for
an
orderly
conduct
of
the
receivership
to
know
what
claims
are
out
there
and...
and
maybe
the...
the
general
language
is
enough
to...
to
give
you
that
authority.
but
why
is
it
necessary
for
a
orderly
conduct
of
the
receivership
to
stop
people
from
commencing
lawsuits
which
you
have
acknowledged
will
be
the
determinative
lawsuits?
you've
acknowledged
that
ultimately
the
state
or
federal
court
determinations
are
going
to
be
what
govern.
justice
antonin
scalia
who
is...
who
is
going
to
make
the
ultimate
determination
in
the
bankruptcy
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
big
difference,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
that's
the
point.
here
the
ultimately...
the
ultimate
determination
is
not
going
to
be
made
by
fslic.
it's
going
to
be
made
by
those
courts
anyway,
as
you...
as
you've
now
told
us.
under
the
former
theory
that
fslic
had,
it
made
some
sense.
you
could
say,
well,
since
ultimately
fslic
is
going
to
make
the
determination,
subject
to...
subject
to
arbitrary
and
capricious
review,
it
makes
a
lot
of
sense
to
say
you
have
to
come
to
fslic
for,
but...
first.
but
now
you
come
before
us
and
you
say
fslic
isn't
the
one
that
makes
the
determination;
it's
going
to
be
the
state
and
federal
courts.
if
that's
the
case,
i
don't
see
any
reason
why...
i
can
see
a
reason
why
you
want
to
know
what
claims
are
out
there,
but
why
don't
you
let
the
courts
go
ahead
and
tell
you
what...
it
actually
helps
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
you'll
know
that
much
sooner
which
claims
are
good
ones.
justice
antonin
scalia
take
a
default.
justice
antonin
scalia
take
a
default.
it
will
serve
them
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can't
imagine,
mr.
minear...
i
don't...
i
don't
know
what
your
experience
with
district
judges
is,
state
of
federal,
but
i
can't
imagine
if
fslic
goes
in
when
the
suit
is
filed
and
says,
you
know,
your
honor,
we
are
in
active
settlement
negotiations,
we're
evaluating
this
thing.
the
court
says,
no,
no,
i'm
sorry.
i
want
to
go
ahead
with
a
trial.
i
want
to
have
a
trial
on
my
docket.
i
can't
imagine
that
that's
what
happens.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
were
actively--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
can...
i
can
more
accurately
predict
a
good
result
from
what
those
judges
will
do
than
a
good
result
from
leaving
it
with
fslic
to...
to...
to
decide
how
long
it
wants
to
act
upon
these
things.
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
bankruptcy
court's
decision
there
is
the
operative
decision.
that's
a
big
difference
from
what...
what...
what...
the
situation
here.
here
the
receiver
does
not
make
the
decision.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
notification
requirement
would
stop
that
problem.
you
don't
need
an
exhaustion
requirement--
