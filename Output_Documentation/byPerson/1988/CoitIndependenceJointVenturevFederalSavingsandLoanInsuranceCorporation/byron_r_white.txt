justice
byron
r.
white
--i
take
it
your
position
isn't
that
once
you
get
your
judgment,
if
you
get
it,
that
you
don't
have
to
go
to
the
receiver.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you...
and
i
suppose
that
the
receiver
would
have
to
wait
until
he
knew
what
the
other
claims
were
before
you
divided
up
the
pie.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i...
i
take
it
that
isn't...
i
guess
that
issue
isn't
here
anyway,
but--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
if...
if
there's
only
10,000
units
available
in
the
pool,
and
you
have
a
judgment
for
5,000
units,
and
yet
there
are
claims
ten
times
that,
do
you
think
you
should
get
a
distribution
for
5,000
units?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you...
you
agree
that...
that
all
the
claims
of
a
certain
class
ought
to
be
in
before
anybody
gets
anything.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
does
say
that
the
corporation
shall
have
authority
to
liquidate
the
institution
in
order...
in
an
orderly
manner.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
a...
that
is
quite
a
grant
of
power.
justice
byron
r.
white
most
claims
are
granted.
most
claims
that
have
any
basis
for
them--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
it's
very
important
to
get
those
out
of
the
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
in
the...
in
the
claims
process
that's
provided
for
by
the
regulations,
it
doesn't
contemplate
any
kind
of
a
hearing,
just
a
filing
and
a
paper...
a
paper
presentation.
justice
byron
r.
white
i...
i
know
they
can,
but
they--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
the...
but
the
claimant
has
no
right
to
an
oral
presentation.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
just...
it
just
contemplates
a...
a
tentative
decision
about
it.
and
if
they're
going
to
grant
it,
it's
final.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they're
not,
why,
you're
going
to
litigate.
justice
byron
r.
white
--what
about
time?
what
about
time?
the
claimant
has
to
wait
until
there's
a
decision
by
fslic.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
can't...
do
you...
can't
the
party
just
file
a
suit?
let's
assume
he
files
with
the
receiver.
may
he
also
file
a
suit
in
court
and
then
have
that
stayed?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
does
he
avoid
the
statute
of
limitations?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
often
aren't.
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's--
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
don't
have
to
do
that
till
you
answer
this
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
statute
of
limitations?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
fslic
you
say
may--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
experience
in
the
ninth
circuit
where
they
have
a
contrary
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
we
decide
for
the
other
side--
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
won't
be
litigating
that--
[inaudible]
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
are
you
litigating
this
issue
in
any
courts
of
appeals
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
anyone...
this
is
a
new
position
that
the...
that
the
fslic
has
taken.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
are
you
presenting
this
to
courts
of
appeals
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
are
you
going
on
the...
down
the
old
road?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
litigation
is
going
on
based
on
the
jurisdictional--
justice
byron
r.
white
--are
there
any
other
decisions
on
this
issue
in
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
where
is
that?
is
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
--what...
what
ca
is
that
in?
