mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
mr.
chief
justice,
and
say
it
please
the
court:
the
savings
and
loan
industry
is
presently
facing
the
worst
financial
crisis
since
the
great
depression.
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board
estimates
that
at
least
400
federally
insured
savings
and
loan
institutions
are
insolvent.
and
the
bank
board,
which
itself
is
facing
serious
financial
constraints,
has
already
ordered
the
liquidation
of
85
other
hopelessly
insolvent
institutions.
the
liquidation
process
is
just
beginning,
and
already
there
are
thousands
of
claims
seeking
billions
of
dollars
against
just
these
85
thrifts.
those
claims
are
pressed
by
a
wide
variety
of
interests,
including
defaulting
borrowers
like
coit,
who
claim
that
they
are
not
obligated
to
pay
back
their
loans
and
that
the
lender,
in
fact,
should
pay
them
damages.
this
case
presents
an
extraordinarily
important,
albeit
it
narrow,
question,
namely,
what
is
the
first
step
in
the
process
for
resolving
these
thousands
of
claims.
we
submit
that
claims
against
an
insolvent
thrift
that
has
been
placed
in
federal
receivership
must
be
presented
to
the
receiver
in
the
first
instance
for
allowance
or
disallowance
before
the
claimant
can
seek
a
judicial
remedy.
the
circuit
courts
that
have
tolled
in
this
vineyard
all
recognize
the
concepts
of
primary
jurisdiction
or
exhaustion
of
remedies
apply,
but
they
have
differed
with
respect
to
whether
a
claimant
must
always
participate
in
the
administrative
process
before
seeking
judicial
review.
the
third,
fifth
and
the
seventh
circuits
require
a
mandatory
resort
to
the
bank
board's
claims
procedure
where
the
ninth
circuit's
morrison-knudsen
decision
held
that
a
trial
court
should
consider
whether
recourse
to
that
process
is
appropriate
under
the
circumstances
of
the
particular
case.
we
submit,
based
on
the
logic
and
language
of
the
relevant
statutes,
that
a
claim...
a
claimant
is
required
to
participate
in
the
bank
board's
claims
process
and
that
any
other
result
would
have
disastrous
consequences
for
the
orderly
liquidation
of
a
failed
thrift.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
your
honor,
we
do
not
say
that
there's
a
statute
that
expressly
requires
exhaustion.
the
exhaustion
requirement,
in
fact,
is
implicit
in
the
statutory
scheme
that
is
set
up
by
the
homeowner's
loan
act
and
the
national
housing
act.
section
5(d)(6)
of
the
homeowner's
act
gives
the
bank
board
exclusive
power
to
reorganize
or
liquidate
an
insolvent
thrift
using
fslic
as
receiver
for
that
purpose.
section
5(d)(11)
then
broadly
states
that
the
board
shall
have
power
to
make
rules
and
regulations
for
the
liquidation
of
associations
and
the
conduct
of
receiverships.
congress,
in
short,
gave
the
bank
board
broad
power
to
design
and
put
into
effect
an
administrative
process
in
lieu
of
the
title
xi
bankruptcy
procedures
for
liquidating
failed
thrift
institutions.
and
here,
as
in
de
la
cuesta,
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
congress
to
have
given
the
bank
board
a
broader
mandate.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
there's...
we're
not
asserting
that
the
bank
board
has
the
power
to
cut
off
a
claim.
we're
asserting
that
a...
that
the
claims
process
only
postpones
judicial
determination
of
that
claim
until
fslic,
after
review
by
the
bank
board,
has
had
a
determination...
a
chance
to
make
a
determination
whether
to
pay,
settle
or
dispute
that
claim.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but
that...
that
really
results...
that
result
follows
from
failure
to
comply
with
the
administrative
process.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but,
your
honor,
i
think
the
same
thing
would
happen
under
the
social
security
act,
for
instance,
if
a
party
refused
to
comply
with
the
secretary's
regulations
governing
the...
the
pursuit
of
a
claim
in
the
administrative
forum.
what
we're
asserting
is
that
the
claimant
does,
in
fact,
have
to
comply
with
these
rules
and
regulations
that
fslic
might...
might
impose.
now,
whether
those
rules
or
regulations
are
fair,
in
fact,
can
be
reviewed
by
this
court.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor,
without
that
sort
of
power,
it
would
be
impossible
to
conduct
any
sort
of
liquidation
procedure
at
all.
if
parties
are
not,
in
fact,
willing
to
comply
with
the...
the
liquidation
scheme
that
congress
has
set
up,
then
the
liquidation
scheme
will
simply
not
work.
we
think
that
this
power
is
implicit
in
the
broad
grant
of
authority
to
create
a
liquidation
scheme.
absent
the
power
to
require
creditors
to
comply
with
the
liquidation
provisions,
it's
going
to
be...
it's
going
to
be
impossible
to
get
anyone
to
even
participate
in
this
liquidation
scheme.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
your
honor,
first
this
question
isn't
squarely
presented
here,
and
we
think--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--we
submit
as
follows
with
respect
to
that
question,
your
honor.
once
fslic
has
made
a
determination
whether
to
pay,
settle
or
dispute
a
claim,
if
it...
if
its
determination
is
to
dispute
the
claim,
the
parties
go
to
court
and
they
litigate
that
question.
and
it,
in
fact,
is
a...
the
beginning
of
a
judicial
remedy.
all
we've
really
done
is
postponed
the
judicial
determination
of
that
claim
until
the
bank
board
has
had
an
opportunity
to
determine
whether
to
allow
it--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
its
denial
of
its
claim
is,
in
essence,
an
assertion
it's
going
to
dispute
that
claim
in
court.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
that's--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--exactly.
and,
in
fact,
fslic
often
cannot
make
a
wise
litigation
judgment
on
these
claims
until
it
has
an
opportunity
to
see
all
the
claims
that
have
been
presented
and
sort
out
the
relationship
between
the
creditors
and
the
validity
and
nature
of
the
claims.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
they
can,
in
fact...
fslic
can,
in
fact,
require
an
oral
presentation.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
they
can
require
it,
but
they
do
not.
it's
not
required.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
he
does
not
have
a
right
to
oral
presentation.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
and
with
respect
to
that,
i
think
it's
useful
to
point
out
how
the...
the
present
status
of
this
receivership.
there
are
over
1,700
claims
that
were
filed
in
this
particular
receivership
that
sought
over
$800
million
in
damages
from
the
receivership
estate.
at
this
point
approximately
570
of
those
claims
have
been
resolved,
either
allowed,
disallowed
or
settled.
at
present
another
530
are
under
negotiation
under
a
global
settlement
plan.
these
530
claims
all
arise
from
67
related
loans.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
bank
board
has
argued
in
a
number
of
cases
that
it's
subject
to
apa
review,
and
the
solicitor
general
disagrees
with
that
position.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
solicitor
general's
position
is
that
the
party
begins
his
claim
anew.
it's,
in
essence,
a
de
novo
determination
of
that
claim.
now,
there
are...
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
at
the
same
time,
however,
that
there
are...
that
the
receivership
determination
can,
in
fact,
constrain
as
a
practical
matter
this
claim
in
various
ways.
for
instance,
the
receivership's
determination
might
be
admissible
in
court
under
a
hearsay
exception.
for
instance,
803(c)(8)
i
think
would
allow
admission
of
that.
it
also
might
lead
to
stipulations
among
the
parties
as
a
practical
matter.
the
net
effect
of
the
receivership
procedure
is
to
narrow
the
issues
in
these
cases.
often
times
it
will
allow
for
a
summary
judgment
determination
of
these
claims
once
the
parties
find
through
the
receivership
process
that
there,
in
fact,
is
no
factual
issues
in
dispute.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
generally,
but
there's
also
an
apa
remedy
in
the...
in
the
event--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--we
submit
that
he
cannot,
that
simply
the
receivership
process
will
not
work
under--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--there's
a
couple
of
ways.
first
of
all,
these
claims
are
often
resolved
long
before
statute
of
limitations--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
in
this
respect,
your
honor,
that
there
has
been
a
claim
here
that
this
claim
has
lingered
for
13
months,
and
i
do
have
to
clarify
the
record
on
that.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
when
this--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--sure.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
certainly,
your
honor.
the
statute
of
limitations
problems
can
be
dealt
with
in
several
ways.
first
of
all,
if
it
appears
that
the
statute
of
limitations
is
going
to
run,
fslic
can
allow
the
party
to
file
its
suit
subject
to
a
stay
pending
the
determination
of
the
receiver
whether
or
not
to
go
forward
with
that
plan.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but,
your
honor,
the...
the...
fslic's
interest
here
is
in
a
fair
resolution
of
these
claims.
and
fslic
does
not
have
any
interest
in
forcing
people
to,
in
fact,
default
on
their
claims
through
a
statute
of
limitations.
that
is
simply
not
what
fslic
is
interested
in
doing.
in
any
event,
if
the
claim
is
delayed,
the
party
can
go
to
court
and
seek
a
remedy
under
the
apa
for
agency
action
unduly
delayed.
there
is
a
remedy
there
that
would
preclude
any
of
these
problems.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
there's
still
the
apa
remedy
in
those
circumstances
for,
in
fact,
obtaining--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
your
honor,
but
that...
first
of
all,
these...
these
threats
are
all
rather
hypothetical.
in
fact,
as
i
pointed
out
already,
in
one
year
the
first
south
receivership
has
resolved
550
of
the
1,380
non-shareholder
claims.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
and
there's
a
reason
for
that,
your
honor.
and
if
i
can
point
out,
when
they...
when
coit
filed
its
claim,
it
also
included
a
letter,
and
this
letter
states:
"claimant's
claims
are
presently
on
appeal
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
"
"the
claimant
will
supply
additional
factual
material
in
support
of
the
attached
proof
of
claim
at
the
appropriate
time,
but
in
order
to
save
cost
to
all
parties,
all
information
is
not
being
presented
at
this
time.
"
as
a
result
of
that--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
yes,
your...
but,
your
honor,
there
is
still...
in
order
for...
these
determinations
are
made
by
separate
parties.
the
receiver
is
not
the
same
person
as
the
person
who
is,
in
fact,
litigating
this
claim
in
a
different
court.
for
the
receiver
and
his
special
representative
to
determine
this
claim,
he
has
to
acquire
certain
information
that
is
going
to
be
necessary
for
him
to
pass
on
that
judgment.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
until
he
receives
that--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--the
bank
board
is
in
control
of
that;
the
department
of
justice
is
not.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
it
can,
but
again,
your
honor,
remember
there
are
1,700
claims
here,
each
of
which
can
be
a
potential
lawsuit.
and
this
is
just
one
receivership.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
your
honor,
that's
true.
and
when
fslic
steps
into
the
shoes
of
the
savings
and
loan
in
these
circumstances,
it
has
the
difficulty
of
learning
about
the
claims,
learning
about
what
those
claims
are
about,
whether
they're
meritorious
or
not,
whether
or
not
to
defend
the
claim,
whether
or
not
to
settle
the
claim,
whether
or
not
to
pay
the
claim.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor,
when
a
claimant,
in
fact,
can
point
to
undue
delay
in
the
administrative
process,
then
that
is
the
time
to
review
that
question.
but
we
don't
have
that
in
these
circumstances.
fslic
has
not
been
provided
with
the
information
necessary
to
act
on
colt's
claim.
and
until
it
does,
it's
very
disingenuous
for
the
party
to
claim
that
this
claim
has
disappeared
into
a
black
hole.
as
for
the
size
of
the
claims
that
are
disputed
here--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
if
that
is
the
only--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--your
honor,
if
that
is
the
only
deficiency
in
these
regulations...
and
i'm
sure
that
the
bank
board
could
enact
a
regulation
that
would
require
action
on
those
claims
within
a
certain
time.
but
you
must
remember
that
these
claims
are
oftentimes
very
complex,
they're
interrelated,
they
cannot
be
resolved
immediately.
mr.
hudspeth's
claim...
they
point
to
the...
the
supposed
nightmare
of
mr.
hudspeth.
he
settled
his
claim
this
summer.
in
fact,
these
claims
are
being
resolved.
hundreds
of
them
are
being
resolved.
thousands
of
them
are
being
resolved.
i
think
it's
also
important
in
terms
of--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
your
honor,
of
course.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but
they
might
also
have
settled
because
fslic
has,
in
fact,
given
them
a
fair
deal
on
their
claims
once
they
determine
how
little
is,
in
fact,
in
the
assets
of
the
receivership
estate.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor,
for
the
very
same
reasons
that
there's
an
automatic
stay
in
bankruptcy,
that
when
the
receiver
or
a
trustee
steps
into
the
shoes
of
an
insolvent
debtor,
it
must
have
an
opportunity
to
assess
the
legal
situation
and
the
financial
situation
of
the
particular
debtor.
without
that
breathing
space,
there's
simply
going
to
be
chaos.
and
that
is
the...
the
prospect
that
we
face
right
here.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
in
the
bankruptcy
case
of
the...
the
claim
itself
would
ultimately
be
made
by
the
bankruptcy
court.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
because
the
receiver--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--the
receiver
also
has
to
have
an
opportunity
to
make
a
determination,
not
simply
know
about
the
claim,
know
that
someone
submits
a
paper
and
says
that
the
receivership
estate
owes
them
$100
million.
they
have
to
have
an
opportunity
to
evaluate
the
legal
significance
of
those
claims
whether
or
not
they're
right
on
the
law,
whether
or
not
the
claim
ought
to
be
settled
because,
in
fact,
there
are
no
assets
in
the
receivership
estate.
one
of
the
anomalies
that
the...
the
court's
position
creates
here
is
tremendous
litigation
over
an
empty
bucket.
there...
in
fact,
in
many
of
these
receivership
estates,
there
are
no
assets,
and
yet
we
have
parties
that
are
going
out
and
filing
claims,
seeking
discovery
and,
in
fact,
demanding
litigation
when,
in
fact,
there
is
no
money
there
that
would
ultimately
pay
the
claims.
the
one--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--what?
[laughter]
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
surprisingly
so,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
the
government
is
not
in
a
position
to
be
taking
default
judgments
in
these
matters.
and
this
is
a
serious
question,
your
honor,
that
in
fact
should
fslic,
if
there
are
no
assets
in
the
receivership
estate,
simply
take
default
judgments.
that's...
that
would
be
a
very
peculiar
situation.
what
is
also
peculiar--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--again,
the
courts...
the
court...
the
bank
board
and
fslic
can
certainly
do
that.
but
if
in
fact,
end
up
litigating
over
the
question
of
exhaustion
itself...
and
that
is
what
is
occurring
in
the
ninth
circuit--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--[inaudible].
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but...
but,
your
honor,
that
neglects
the
fact
that
oftentimes
many
of
these
claims
will
all
arise
out
of
one
piece
of
property,
one
or
a
series
of
related
transactions.
suits
will
be
filed
all
across
the
country
all
relating
to
that
particular
property.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the...
what
fslic
tells
me
is,
in
fact,
they
spend
a
good
deal
of
time
now
litigating
whether
or
not
the
claims
process
ought
to
be
exhausted.
and,
in
fact,
they
can
spend
thousands
and,
in
some
cases,
tens
of
thousands
of
dollars--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--[inaudible]
determinations.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
we
won't,
but
we'll
be
litigating
the...
certainly
the
litigation
bills
will
be
even
higher.
and
it's
important
to
remember
that
those
litigation
costs
are
borne
by
the
receivership
estate.
and
this
is
where
we
go
again
to
the
point
of
a
need
for
an
orderly
mechanism
for
litigating
these
claims.
all
that
fslic
is
asking
for
in
this
situation
is
the
opportunity
to
evaluate
whether
to
pay,
settle
or
disallow
a
claim--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--but
is
this
court
really--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--is
this
court
really
willing
to
rule
on
that
decision
based
on
its
perception
of
what
hundreds,
literally
hundreds,
of
judges
might
do
in
particular
cases?
there
really
is
a
need
for
a
rule
here
to
restore
order.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
it
has
been
treated
as
if
this
whole
process
is
truly
unique
or
abnormal.
but
we
only
need
to
look
to
texas
state
procedures
to
see
that,
in
fact,
this
is
the
way
that
receiverships
are
often
conducted.
under
article
852(a)
of
the
texas
civil
code,
section
8.09,
texas
has
established
a
receivership
proceeding...
and,
in
fact,
they
call
it
a
liquidation
proceeding...
that
is
very
similar
to,
in
fact,
what
fslic
is
advocating
in
this
particular
case.
in
that
case,
the
liquidating
agency--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--your
honor,
this...
again
let's
remember
the
context
of
these
statutes.
they
were
enacted
in
1933
at
a
time
when
there
were
thousands
of
foreclosures
taking
place.
there's
very
little
legislative
history
on
this
statute,
and
it's
quite
clear
that
what
congress
did
in
this
particular
statute
was
delegate
exceedingly
broad
authority
to
the
agency
to
create
a
liquidation
scheme.
they
entrusted
the
agency
with
that
responsibility
in
lieu
of
the
bankruptcy
procedures.
and,
in
fact,
the
result
that...
that
would
follow
from
coit's
argument
here
would
be
that
there
would
be
less
protection
and
far
less
protection
than
is
available
under
the
bankruptcy
scheme.
and
we
can't
believe
that
congress
really
wished
that
sort
of
anomaly,
that
in
the
case
of
every
other
insolvent
debtor
except
thrifts--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that's...
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but
that
simply
underscores
the
difficulties
of
the
problems
that
are
faced
here.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but,
your
honor,
let's
compare
this
again
to
the
texas
code
that
i
was
alluding
to
simply
a
few
minutes
earlier.
in
that
case
a
liquidating
agent
is
appointed.
the
liquidating
agent
has
authority
to
pass
on
claims.
when
he
makes...
first
of
all,
all
the
parties
are
required
to
submit
their
claims
to
the
liquidating
agent
within
a
period
of
time.
it's
longer
than
the...
than
the
fslic
program.
but
if
a
party
does
not
submit
his
claim,
he
is
precluded
from
any
participation
in
the
distribution
of
the
receivership
assets
until
all
of
the
other
claimants
who
have
timely
filed
have
been
paid
off
in
full.
now,
after
the
party
submits
his
claim
to
the
liquidating
agent,
the
liquidating
agent
makes
a
determination
on
that,
on
that
claim.
if
he
determines
to
disallow
the
claim,
the
party
is
then
entitled
to
bring
a
suit
in
state
court
in
a
particular
county,
mind
you,
in
travis
county,
to
in
fact
litigate
that
claim.
now,
that's
not
far
removed
from
what
the
receiver
is
asking
for
here.
and,
indeed,
it
would
be
quite
anomalous
if
in
the
case
of
federal
receiverships,
no
such
protection
is
given,
but
in
the
case
of
state
receiverships,
that
protection
is
available
when
they
are
liquidated
through
the
state
proceedings.
there
are
other
anomalies
that
result
from
coit's
position
that
i
must
point
out.
absent
a
centralized
process
requiring
presentation
of
claims,
fslic
would
have
to
wait
until
the
expiration
of
the
longest
period...
the
longest
possible
statute
of
limitations
before
it
could
even
determine
the
total
amount
of
claims
that
face
the
receivership.
fslic,
accordingly,
would
be
unable
to
begin
even
partial
distribution
of
assets
until
that
time.
under
these
circumstances,
it's
clear
that
fslic
would
have
great
difficulty
in
making
even
interim
distributions
because
it
must
wait
until
it
has
all
the
claims
before
it.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
notification
would
solve
that
particular
problem,
but
it
wouldn't
solve
the
problem
that
courts
could
still
become
engaged
in
pointless
litigation.
as
i
pointed
out
before,
some
receiverships
have
no
assets.
in
other
cases,
individual
claimants
are
each
pursuing
their
claim
without
regard
to
others
and,
in
fact,
are
exhausting
the
receivership
assets.
now,
that
certainly
is
not
in
the
best
interest
of
an
orderly
liquidation.
and
it's
not
in
the
best
interest
of
the
claimants
in
this
situation
either.
now,
colt
has
raised
several
other
objections
here
to
the...
to
this
process.
and
one
of
those
is
the
question
of
foreclosures.
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
fslic
gives
as
much
protection
to
foreclosures
as
the
states
often
give.
a
party
is
entitled
upon
receiving
notice
of
a
foreclosure
to
seek
a
stay
on
an
expedited
basis
from
the
bank
board.
if
the
bank
board
rejects
that
stay,
the
party
then
has
an
opportunity
to
seek
judicial
review
before
the
foreclosure
takes
place.
in
this
particular
case,
there
was
a
notice
of
foreclosure,
and
based
on
the...
the
litigation,
the
ongoing
litigation,
and
other
matters
as
well,
fslic
has
determined
not
to
foreclose
on
that
property.
there's
no--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--in...
in
states
where
it's
operating
under
a
deed
of
trust--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
state
law.
they
are
looking
to
state
law.
but
in
most
states
now,
there
are
nonjudicial
procedures
for
foreclosure.
and
as
for
the...
with
respect
to
the
claim-counterclaim
controversy,
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
administrative
claims
process
will
inevitably
lead
to
the
resolution
of
fslic
claims
and
creditor
counterclaims
in
different
forums.
when
fslic
is
litigating
a
claim
against
a
receivership
claimant,
it
can
agree
to
stay
its
action
pending
the
claimant's
exhaustion
of
the
administrative
remedy.
furthermore,
a
district
court
in
appropriate
circumstances
could
order
such
a
result.
in
any
event,
the
mere
possibility
that
claims
and
counterclaims
might
be
decided
in
different
forums
provides
no
reason
for
dispensing
with
the
substantial
benefits
that
flow
to
every
claimant
from
the
administrative
claims
process.
finally,
colt
has
discussed
the
careful
balance
between
the
bank
statute,
the
national
bank
act,
and
the
thrift
statute
in
this
case.
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
that
the
states...
the
banks
and
thrifts
operate
under
completely
different
statutes.
and
in
addition,
it's
important
to
point
out
that
there
is
a
centralized
procedure
in
the
banking
context
that
does
allow
for...
for
determination
of
these
claims;
12
u.s.c.
94
of
the
national
bank
act
provides,
in
fact,
that
all
claims
must
be
filed...
in
a
receivership
must
be
filed
in
a
particular
district.
and
that,
in
effect,
solves
the
centralized...
centralization
problem
that
i've
discussed
so
far.
again,
i
think
it's
important...
we
cannot
understate
the
importance...
or
we
cannot
overstate
the
importance
of
a
centralized
process
resolving
these
thousands
of
claims.
and,
again,
this
situation
is
only
likely
to
grow
worse.
in
short,
the
bank
board's
administrative
claims
process
is
a
lawful
and
sensible
first
step
in
resolving
creditor
claims.
the
bank
board
can
justly
require
that
claimants
participate
in
this
process
before
seeking
a
judicial
remedy.
any
other
result
would
severely
cripple
the
bank
board's
ability
to
deal
with
the
present
savings
and
loan
crisis,
a
crisis
that
is
widely
expected
to
grow
only
worse
in
the
coming
years.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
believe
that
the
issue
continues
to
be...
to
arise
in
courts
of
appeals.
many
courts
are
simply
staying
these
actions
pending
your
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
part
of
the
problem
here
is--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--the
bank
board,
in
fact,
conducts
the
litigation
in
the
lower
courts,
and
we've
advised
them
of
our
views
on
these
matters.
the
bank
board
does
not
necessarily
agree
with
us
on
every
point;
however--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i'm
not
sure
whether
it
is
or
not.
i
think
that
the
bank
board
is,
in
fact,
trying
to
dismiss
these
claims
based
on
our
theory,
but
i
can't
be
certain
what--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--the
most
recent
decision
that
i'm
aware
of
is
the
o'henry
decision
which,
in
fact,
is
not
squarely
a
hudspeth
decision
but,
in
fact,
does
address
hudspeth
as
a
question
of
primary
jurisdiction.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
have
filed
a
copy
of
that
opinion
with
the
clerk
of
the
court.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
this
is
in
the
fifth
circuit,
and
there's
a
concurrence
by
judge
higginbotham
in
which
he
discusses
his
view
of
the
hudspeth
decision
as
well.
so,
in
fact,
there
is...
there
does
continue
to
be
litigation
here.
judge
higginbotham
does
treat
this
as
a
matter
of
primary
jurisdiction,
and
he
points
out
that
hudspeth,
in
fact,
did
not
address
the
issues
of
what
judicial
relief
or
remedy
would
be
available
after
the
administrative
process
is
followed.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
