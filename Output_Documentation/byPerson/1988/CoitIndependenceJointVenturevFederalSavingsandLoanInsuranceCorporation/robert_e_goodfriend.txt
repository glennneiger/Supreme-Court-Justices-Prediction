mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
so-called
hudspeth
doctrine,
a
rule
of
law
that
was
announced
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
1985
and
that
effectively
closes
the
courthouse
door
to
creditors
of
insolvent
savings
and
loans
that
have
been
placed
in
receivership
by
the
federal
savings
and
loan
insurance
corporation,
which
i
will
refer
to
hereafter
as
fslic.
under
the
so-called
hudspeth
doctrine,
at
least
as
it
was
originally
conceived,
a
creditor's
claim
must
first
be
presented
to
fslic,
then
any
adverse
ruling
appealed
to
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board,
and
thereafter
any
adverse
determination
reviewed
by
the
courts
under
a
very
limited
standard
of
review
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
this
case
began
when
coit,
a
real
estate
partnership,
sued
firstsouth,
a
federal
savings
and
loan,
in
state
court,
suing
firstsouth
for
usury,
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
and
breach
of
a
duty
of
good
faith
and
fair
dealing
in
connection
with
two
real
estate
transactions.
the
case
remained
in
state
court
for
approximately
two
months
at
which
time
firstsouth
became
insolvent
and
was
placed
in
receivership
by
fslic.
thereafter,
fslic's
move
to
dismiss
the
case
from
federal
court
under
the
hudspeth
doctrine,
which
motion
was
granted,
and
coit
took
an
appeal
to
the
fifth
circuit.
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed
relying
on
its
prior
decisions
under
the
hudspeth
case.
this
court
then
granted
a
writ
of
certiorari.
a
conflict
presently
exists
between
the
fifth
and
the
ninth
circuits
on
the
hudspeth
doctrine,
the
ninth
circuit
having
rejected
the
hudspeth
doctrine
in
the
morrison-knudsen
case.
now,
the
issue
has
changed
somewhat
from
what
it
was
when
this
court
initially
granted
a
writ
of
certiorari.
initially
this
case
involved
the
question
of
whether
congress
by
statutes
had
ousted
the
federal
courts
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
to
hear
a
broad
range
of
creditor
or
claims
against
an
insolvent
savings
and
loan
association.
in
so
ruling,
the
fifth
circuit
relied
on
two
statutory
provisions:
12
u.s.c.
1464(d)(6)(c)
which
has
the
restrain
or
affect
language,
and
12
u.s.c.
29(d)
which
makes
fslic's
appointment
as
receiver
"subject
only
to
the
regulation
of
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board.
"
a
recent
law
review
article
in
the
western
new
england
law
review,
which
we
have
sent
the
court,
extensively
reviews
the
legislative
history
of
these
provisions
and
i
think
presents
convincing
legislative
history
that
neither
of
these
provisions
has
anything
to
do
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
to
hear
creditor
claims.
the
restrain
or
affect
language
was
inserted
initially
to
limit
challenges
by
the
savings
and
loan
itself
and
by
its
directors
to
the
appointment
of
fslic
as
receiver
limiting
those
challenges
to
a
30-day
period.
and
that's
specifically
in
the
statute.
and
the
subject
only
to
the
regulation
of
the
board
language
was
apparently
inserted
in
response
to
a
special
situation
which
arose
in
the
state
of
illinois
where
a
state
court-appointed
receiver
ignored
fslic's
request
for
information
and
fslic's
monetary
claims.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
yes.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
was
about
to
get
exactly
to
that
point.
let
me
just
say
we've
also
argued
on...
in
terms
of
the
initial
position
of
the
court
that
any
determination
as
to
the
amount
and
validity
of
a
claim
has
never
been
considered
to
be
an
interference
with
the
functions
of
the
receiver
at
common
law.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
no,
it
has
not,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
exactly,
retained
for
further
review.
it
has
now
been
13
months
since
that
claim
was
originally
filed
and
a
little
bit
more
than
two
years
since
coit
originally
sued
in
state
court.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
we...
we
reject
both
the
initial
position
of
the
fifth
circuit,
which
was
a
subject
matter
jurisdiction
position,
and
we
also
reject
the
revised
position
of
the
solicitor
general
which
concerns
agency-mandated
exhaustion,
which
we
wish
to
clearly
distinguish
from
court-mandated
exhaustion,
which
was
referred
to
somewhat
in
the
morrison-knudsen
case.
we
think
the
implications
of
agency-mandated
exhaustion
are
very
different
from
judicial
exhaustion.
the
solicitor
general
has
revised
the
issue
in
this
case.
he
no
longer
takes
the
position
that
this
is
a
matter
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
and
he
no
longer
takes
the
position
that
fslic
has
the
power
to
adjudicate
creditor
claims.
what
he
does
say...
and
i
think
this
is
the
nub
of
the
case...
is
that
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board
has
the
power
to
promulgate
regulations
under
section
5(d)(11)
of
the
homeowner's
loan
act
to
mandate
that
creditors
exhaust
their
administrative
remedies
before
fslic
and
the
board
before
seeking
review
in
the
courts.
we
think
that
the
solicitor
general
contemplates
de
novo
review
after
completion
of
the
exhaustion
process,
but
his
position
in
this
regard
is
not
entirely
clear.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
your
honor,
i
think...
we
think
there
still
is.
initially
that...
that
was
my
thought.
but
what
we
submit,
your
honor,
is
where
the
delay
in
agency-mandated
jurisdiction
is
undue,
as
it
has
been
in
these
cases,
so
that
ultimate
judicial
review
may
be
ineffective
or
worthless
to
a
litigant,
article
iii
concerns
and
seventh
amendment
concerns
are
still
in
the
case.
as
for
the
due
process
question,
the
constitutional
due
process
question
of
the
absence
of
a
disinterested
tribunal,
that
is
very
definitely
still
in
the
case
because
this
court
has
held
in
gibson
v.
berryhill
and
in
ward
v.
monroeville
that
a
party
is
entitled
to
a
disinterested
tribunal
at
the
first
level
even
if
he
subsequently
obtains
de
novo
judicial
review.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
your
honor,
the
delay
we
say
has
hurt
our
client
in
a
number
of
ways.
the
significant
thing
is
that
this
case
involves
a
wasting
asset.
the
solicitor
general
refers
to
it
as
a
limited
pool
of
assets.
it
doesn't
involve
the...
the
savings
and
loan
has
long
since
gone.
it
has
been...
but
there
is
a
pool
of
money.
that
pool
of
money
is
wasting
every
day.
it
is
wasting
in
receivership
expenses.
it
may
be
diminished
by
interim
distributions
made
to
other
creditors.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
absolutely.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
yes,
your
honor.
but
the
validity
of
our
claim
might
have
already
been
determined
in
a
state
court.
indeed,
the--
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
well,
what
we
say
is
we
would
then
be
in
line
for
a
potential
distribution
from
the
receiver
depending
upon
the
priority
of
our
claims
under
fslic's
regulations,
and
we
might
receive
substantially
more
money,
maybe
50
percent
of
the
amount
of
our
total
claim,
instead
of
two
or
three
years
down
the
line,
maybe
we
might
receive
only
20
percent.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
well,
my
understanding
is
that
interim...
interim
distributions
from
a
receivership
estate
are
authorized.
now,
it
does
depend
upon
the
priorities
whether
i
think
you're
on
a
higher
level
of
priorities
or
low
level
of
priorities.
and
quite
frankly,
fslic's
priorities
in
this
regard
are
not
clear
except
for
the
fact
that
in
certain
states
they
have
promulgated
a
regulation
recently
whereby
they
have
placed
themselves
in
the
position
where
they
can
recover
on
their
subrogation
claims
first
ahead
of
every
other
creditor,
we
think
a
very
questionable
ruling
on
their
part.
we
also
say,
your
honor,
that
we
are
potentially
threatened
every
day
by
foreclosure
on
our
property.
the
situation
there
is
that
the
receiver
had
at
one
earlier
point,
in
fact,
about
two
weeks
before
the
fifth
circuit
ruled
in
this
case,
posted
coit's
property
for
foreclosure.
we
then
petitioned
the
board
under
the
expedited
claims
procedure
to
stay
that
posting
of
the
foreclosure,
and
before
the
board
could
act,
fslic
voluntarily
withdrew
its
claim
without
prejudice
to
reinstating
it
at
any
time.
so,
i
could
leave
this
podium
today,
go
back
to
my
office
in
dallas
and
find
out
that
fslic
is
foreclosing
on
my
client's
property.
and
nothing
prevents
them
from
doing
that.
the
only
thing
i
can
do
is
go
back
to
the
board
and
ask
them
for
discretionary
relief.
so,
we
say
that
that
constant
threat
and
the
wasting
nature
of
this
asset
not
only...
makes
even
the
constitutional
claims
ripe
for
review
at
this
time.
i
would
like
to
make
a
number
of
points
at
the
outset,
if
i
may.
first--
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
your
honor,
as
i
understand
the
board's
position,
in
its
regulations
they
say
that
when
property
is
posted
for
foreclosure,
a...
the
owner
of
that
property
has
five
working
days
to
seek
relief
from
fslic...
excuse
me...
from
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board,
which
is
the
supervisory
agency
over
fslic,
from
the
foreclosure.
and
then,
if
he
misses
the
five
working
days,
his
right
to
seek
judicial
review
is
waived.
if
he
gets
within
that...
those
five
working
days,
he
may
then
appeal
the
board's
failure
to
give
that
judicial
relief
into
the
courts.
but
he
may
not
initially
go
into
a
state
court,
which
i
submit
almost
every
litigant
not
familiar
with
these
arcane
procedures
would
do
and
seek
a
temporary
restraining
order.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
absolutely.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
but
it's
easy
to
miss
those
five
days.
i
would
like
to
make
a
couple
of
points
at
the
outset.
one
is
the
tremendous
breadth
of
the
hudspeth
doctrine.
this
is
not
a
doctrine
which
applies
only
to
a
narrow
range
of
claims
as
to
which
the
board
might
claim
some
expertise.
it
applies
to
virtually
every
conceivable
state
and
federal
cause
of
action
against
an
insolvent
savings
and
loan.
it
covers
antitrust
claims,
securities
claims,
employment
discrimination
claims,
rico,
and
under
state
law
a
breach
of
contract,
fraud,
usury,
even
personal
injury
claims.
if
i
left
this
courtroom
and
was
hit
by
a
vehicle
owned
by
a
savings
and
loans
that
was
insolvent
or
one
that
became
insolvent,
i
would
have
to
present
my
personal
injury
claim
to
fslic.
further,
the
board
has
defined
in
its
regulations
the
concept
of
claims
so
broadly
that
it
includes
compulsory
counterclaims
and
even
affirmative
defenses.
if
fslic
goes
into
court
and
sues
my
client
on
a
note,
which
they
could
do
in
this
case,
foreclose
on
the
property
and
sue
on
the
deficiency,
or
on
a
contract,
as
they
did
in
mr.
hudspeth's
case,
he
may
not...
the
defendant
may
not
counterclaim
or
set
off
his
own
claims
against
fslic
in...
in
court,
but
must,
according
to
the
hudspeth
doctrine,
raise
his
counterclaims
or
even
some
courts
have
held
his
affirmative
defense
by
way
of
offset
in
the
administrative
proceeding.
so,
what
this
does--
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
--is
bifurcate.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
yes,
your
honor.
they
have...
i
will
read
to
the
court.
they
have
defined
the
term
"claim"
in...
in
their...
i
have
the
april
regulations.
i
understand
from
my
co-counsel,
mr.
art
leibold,
that
just
yesterday
fslic
made
these
regulations
final
with
some
additional
prefatory
language
that
i
have
not
seen.
but
under
the
term
"claim",
your
honor,
"claim
includes
but
is
not
limited
to
demand
for
recoupment,
set-off,
security,
priority
or
preference.
"
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
no.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
no,
your
honor.
but...
but
you
do
have
that
issue
before...
my
client
has
been
threatened
with
foreclosure
once.
and
the
question
of--
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
--your
honor,
it
hasn't
happened
yet.
it
can
happen
on
the
facts
here
before
the
court
because
once
fslic
forecloses
on
the
property,
they
can
sue
my
client
on
the
deficiency
on
the
note.
and
then,
when
i
raise
our...
try
to
raise
those
as
a
defense
or
offset
in
federal
court,
i
will
be
referred
to
the
administrative
track
under
hudspeth.
so,
it
hasn't
happened
yet,
but
it's...
it
is
implicit
in
the
facts
of
the
case.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
you
say
for
notice
purposes.
is
this...
is
your--
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
--that
goes
to
the
bar
date,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
that's
i
think
a
very
important
point.
what
we
say
happens
in
this
case
is
that
the
combination
of
a
mandatory
exhaustion
requirement,
together
with
the
receiver's
bar
date,
which
is
usually
90
days
after
the
receiver
publishes
notice
of
the
receivership
to
all
creditors,
actually
operates
to
modify
substantive
state
and
federal
statutes
of
limitation.
so,
if
you
combine
that
with
the
mandatory
exhaustion
requirement,
i
would
dispute
it.
if
you
say
there
is
only
a
permissive
exhaustion
requirement,
as
there
is
under
the
national
bank
act
where
a
creditor
can
file
a
claim,
if
he
wishes,
with
the
receiver,
but
the
bar
date
of
the
receiver...
this
is
the
queenan
v.
mays
case...
does
not
prevent
the
creditor
from
going
into
court
even
after
the
bar
date
has
run
and
having
the
validity
of
his
claim
determined
there.
now,
he
cannot
execute
on
any
judgment
he
obtains
from
a
court.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
a
voluntary
claims
procedure.
is
that
the
same
as--
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
--let
me
ask
this.
does
that
contemplate
that
we
cannot
go
into
court
until
we--
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
--comply?
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
your
honor,
that
takes
it...
i
would
say
this,
that
there
is
no
authority
for
that.
but
if
it
does
not
entail
any
significant
deferring
of
federal
court
jurisdiction,
yes.
if
it
requires
any
significant
deferring
of
federal
court
jurisdiction
under
express
jurisdictional
grants
to...
to
litigants,
i
would
say
no.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
i
wouldn't
like
it.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
there
is
no
express
authority
for
this,
your
honor.
i
would
say
this,
that
if
this
court
held
that
such
a
notice
requirement
were
required,
but
that
a
litigant,
once
he
complied,
could
go
immediately
to
federal
court,
i
would
say
there
would
be
no
significant
infringement
on...
or
it
would
not
be
a
significant
abuse
of
the
powers
granted
by
congress.
the
problem
here--
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
--it
could
have--
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
a
question
of
power.
and
what
i
think
is
that
really
what
is
at
stake
here
is
the
question
of
whether
an
agency
can
by
regulation
with
no
express
statutory
authority
force
a
federal
court
to
defer
jurisdiction.
and
i
think
that
is
probably
the
key
question
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
no,
[inaudible]--
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
they
would
have
to
be
amended.
what
is
requires
now
is
that
the
creditor
file
a
claim
and
then
it
sits...
he
cannot
go
to
court,
and
it
sits
there
until
the
special
representative
either
denies
it
or
retains
it
for
further...
no...
either
grants
it,
denies
or
retains
it
for
further
review.
and
what
we
have
shown
in
the
limited
statistics
we
have
available--
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
--is
they're
very
large
claims.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
no.
that
is
not...
my
position,
your
honor,
is
you
have
to
go
to
the
receiver.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
your
honor,
that's
what
the
fifth
circuit
thought.
and
that
seems
contrary
to
all
prior
receivership
practice
and
contrary,
for
example,
to
interim
distributions
which
are
authorized
under
the
bankruptcy
code.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
well,
it's
here
only
in
that
the
fifth
circuit
felt
that
that
was
a
restraint.
and
he
needed
to
know
the...
he
would
say
we
need
to
know
the
denominator
of
the
equation,
how
much
we're
going
to
pay
out,
before
we
can
pay
anything
out.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
well,
what
has
happened,
your
honor,
first
of
all,
sometimes
claims
of
a
certain
priority
are
all
in
and
a
receiver
can
make
distribution
with--
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
--without
prejudicing--
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
--no,
i
don't,
your
honor.
i
think
you
can
set
up
a...
let
me
say
under
the
bankruptcy
code
there
is
a
provision
that
contemplates
this
where
you
can
set
up
a
reserve
where
there
is
contested
litigation.
and
you
can
make
distributions
to
creditors
whose
claims
are
liquidated
while
the
receiver
sets
up
a
reserve
to
cover
the
claims
of
those
that
are
not.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
they
are
required.
the
point
is
this
that
the
fifth
circuit's
assumption
that
all
the
claims
must
be
litigated
and
therefore
that
the
mere
attempt
to
liquidate
a
claim
in
court
is
a
restraint
is
fallacious.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
i
agree,
your
honor.
he
does
not
have
to
follow
those
provisions,
but
the
point
is
it
is
his
voluntary
decision
to
make
or
not
make
interim
distributions.
he
does
not
have
to
have
all
claims
liquidated
before
he
can
make
any
distribution.
what
i'd
like
to
address,
if
i
may,
is
the...
what
i
think
is
the
critical
issue
in
this
case,
and
that
is
the
question
of
whether...
whether
or
not...
what
the
standard
of
review
is
for
determining
the
validity
of
a
regulation
by
a
federal
agency
mandating
exhaustion
where,
as
the
solicitor
general
admits
in
this
case,
there
is
no
express
statutory
authority
for
a
mandatory
exhaustion
requirement
in
the
statute;
and
secondly,
where
the
solicitor
general
has
cited
no
relevant
legislative
history
concerning
congressional
intent
to
require
exhaustion.
yet,
in
that
context,
the
solicitor
general
proposes
the
most
deferential
standard
of
review
as
to
the
validity
of
this
exhaustion
regulation.
he
proposes
that
it
be
reviewed
under
the
standard
of
whether
it
is
reasonably
related
to
the
purposes
of
the
enabling
legislation.
we
discuss
this
in
footnote
15
of
our
brief.
and
he
relies
on
mourning
v.
family
publications
and
weinberger
v.
salfi,
and
a
number
of
other
cases
cited
in
a
footnote.
secondly,
hudspeth...
in
the
morrison-knudsen
case
there
was
an
oblique
reference
to
the
standard
of
review
of
administrative
regulations,
and
the
court
there
referred
to
the
chevron
v.
national
resource
defense
council
case
by
this
court.
and
also
there's
a
duke
law
journal
that
has
been
sent
to
this
court
which
uses
the
chevron
test
which
is
also
very
deferential.
it
is
whether
or
not
the
regulations
should
be
upheld
according
to
chevron
if
it
is
not
arbitrary,
capricious
or
manifestly
contrary
to
the
statute.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
what
i'm
talking
about,
your
honor,
is
the
validity...
the
sg
has
taken
the
position
that
fslic
has
the
power...
the
board
has
the
power
to
impose
these
regulations.
and
the
question
is,
under
section
5(d)(11)
of
the
act,
which
is
a
general
grant
to
fslic
of
the
power
to
set
up
receiverships...
and
the
question
is
does
the
board
have
the
power
to
impose
mandatory
exhaustion
requirements
under
that
general
grant
of
power
and,
if
so,
by
what
standard
is
the
validity
of
the
exercise
of
that
power
to
be
determined.
and
we
reject
both
the
chevron
test
and
mourning
v.
family
publications
and
weinberger
v.
salfi.
and
we
do
so
because
we
believe
that
what
is
at
issue
here
is
the
validity
of
agency
regulations
which
attempt
to
limit
the
access
of
litigants
to
the
courts.
and
traditionally,
when
dealing
with
a
limitation
on
the
right
of
access
to
the
courts,
this
court
has
always
subjected
that
kind
of
legislation
or
regulation
to
a
higher
degree
of
scrutiny
than
other
types
of
legislation,
and
it
has
placed
the
burden
of
showing
that
congress
intended
to
limit
access
on
the
party
asserting
the
limitation.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
distinguished
salfi,
your
honor,
because
there
the
statute
expressly
contemplated
exhaustion.
it
said
you've
got
to
go
to
the
secretary
and
then
you
can
appeal
any
final
decision.
the
statute
set
up
the
exhaustion
mechanism.
an
agency
did
not
by
fiat
with
no
statutory
authorization
at
all
declare
exhaustion.
and
i
have
found
no
case...
and
maybe
the
solicitor
general
can...
can
advise
the
court.
i
have
found
no
case
from
this
court
which
has
determined
whether
an
agency
can
enact
an
agency-directed
and
mandated
exhaustion
requirement
with
no
statutory
authorization.
and
the
question
is
when
that
happens,
what
is
the
standard
of
review.
and
we
submit
that
under...
this
court
has
used
a
heightened
scrutiny
in
johnson
v.
robison
and
abbott
laboratories
v.
gardner
to
review
cases
where
congress
tries
to
limit
judicial
review.
and
even
in
the
abstention
area,
justice
brennan
writing
for
the
court
in
colorado
river
water
conservation
district
and
later
the
court's
decision
in
moses
cohn
where
abstention
comes
up,
which
is
also
a
postponing
of
the...
of
jurisdiction,
this
court
has
referred
to
the
virtually
unflagging
obligation
of
the
federal
courts
to
exercise
the
jurisdiction
given
them.
we
think
mourning
is
inapplicable.
it
does
not
involve
exhaustion.
chevron
doesn't
involve
exhaustion.
weinberger
did,
but
it
was
expressly
in
the
statute.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
possibly
if--
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
--i
think
if
it
contemplated
action
by
the
action
by
the
secretary,
in
some
ways
i
think
the
agency
could
flesh
out
the
details
of
the
exhaustion
requirement.
the
point
here
is
all
you
have
is
a
general
grant
to
the
agency
to
enact
regulations
dealing
with
receiverships.
nowhere
does
it
contemplate
a
priority,
who
goes
first.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
yes,
your
honor,
it
does
say
that.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
but,
your
honor,
i
think
this
is
the
significant
thing.
only
creditors
of
savings
and
loans
have
to
go
through
this
administrative
process
which
involves
no...
no
hearings,
no...
no
taking
of
evidence,
only
one-way
discovery
basically.
the
creditors
of
just
about
every
other
financial
institution,
banks,
credit
unions,
insurance
companies,
in
liquidation,
when
those
financial
institutions
go
into
litigation...
into
liquidation,
all
those
other
creditors
get
to
have
their
claims
determined
in
court.
under
the
national
bank
act,
since
the
1800s,
creditors
of
banks
have
had
the
right
to
have
their
claims
determined
in
court.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
we're
not
fighting
about
what,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
well,
as
far
as
i
know,
your
honor,
under
the
national
bank
act,
there
is
no
exhaustion
requirement.
in
fact,
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
there
is
a
voluntary
claims
procedure
before
the
fdic,
and
a
creditor
who,
say,
has
a
small
claim
and
doesn't
want
to
incur
the
expense
of...
of
litigation
can
go
there.
but
the
fact
that
that
claims
procedure
exists
and
the
fact
that
the
receiver
may
impose
a
bar
date
in
a
bank
liquidation
does
not
prevent
a
creditor
of
a
national
bank
in
receivership
under
fdic
from
having
his
claim
determined
in
federal
or
state
court.
and
that
discrimination
i
believe
between
creditors
of
savings
and
loans
and
creditors
of
banks
i
think
is
going
to
upset
the
careful
balance
that
congress
has
crafted
between
savings
and
loans
and
banks
and
other
financial
institutions.
and
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
u.s.
savings
league,
the
trade
association
of
the
largest
number
of
savings
and
loans
in
this
country,
is
here
in
this
court
filing
an
amicus
curiae
brief
on
behalf
of
coit
and
against
the
regulatory
agency
that
regulates
savings
and
loans
is
that
they
fear
that
the
hudspeth
doctrine
is
going
to
cause
businessmen
in
the
future
to
prefer
banks
and
other
financial
institutions
over
savings
and
loans
when
it
comes
to
engaging
in
new
business
transactions.
and
we
think
savings
and
loans
are
going
to
be...
and
apparently
they
do
to...
going
to
be
seriously
hurt
by
the
existence
of
the
hudspeth
doctrine.
we
also
think
that
the
hudspeth
doctrine
threatens
the
security
of
many
homeowners
in
this
country
who,
because
of
the
limited
nature
of
review
for
foreclosure
proceedings,
actually
stand
at
risk
if
their
mortgages
are
held
by
savings
and
loans
because
if
fslic
posts
their
home
for
foreclosure,
even
mistakenly,
and
they
don't
meet
that
five-day
window,
their
property
can
be
taken
and
no
court
in
the
land
under
the
hudspeth
doctrine
can
come
to
their
aid.
so,
we
believe
that
this
is
a
sweeping
doctrine.
and
we
believe
if
that
if
the
board
wishes
to
contravene
the
rights
of
these
litigants
to
avail
themselves
of
express
jurisdictional
grants
from
congress
and
to
shorten
federal
and
state
statutes
of
limitations,
then
the
board
has
the
burden
to
show
that
congress
intended
to
make
an
exception
where
insolvent
savings
and
loans
are
concerned.
we
believe
if
any
lesser
standard
were
used,
then
every
federal
agency
could
require
exhaustion
simply
by
adopting
a
regulation
to
that
effect.
