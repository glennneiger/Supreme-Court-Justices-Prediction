may
i
also
inquire
whether
as
of
this
time
the
claim
of
your
client
has
ever
been
acted
upon--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--administratively?
it's
still
in
the
so-called
black
hole?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
statutes
do
not
permit
fslic,
as
you
call
it,
to
adopt
an
administrative--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--exhaustion
requirement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
there
is
de
novo
review,
there
wouldn't
be
any
article
iii
problems.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
minear,
the...
the
petitioner
alleges
that
in
actuality
the
small
claims
are
dealt
with
by
fslic
and
resolved,
and
the
claims
that
amount
to
substantial
sums
of
money
go
into
the
so-called
black
hole
and
just
aren't
acted
on.
how
is
the
administrative
scheme
adequate
under
this
court's
holdings
if
there
is
no
time
limit
and
if
there
is
no
reasonable
mechanism
by
which
the
creditors
can
expect
to
see
action
in
a
timely
fashion
on
their
claims?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
administrative
regulations
that
even
purports
to
set
any
kind
of
time
limit
for
action
by
the
fslic.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
would
find
it
very
difficult
to
think
that's
an
adequate
administrative
remedy
frankly.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
in
the
mid
1980s,
the
petitioner,
coit
independence
joint
venture
a
real
estate
firm,
borrowed
money
form
firstsouth,
a
federal
savings
and
loan
association.
they
had
subsequent
disagreements,
and
the
petitioner
filed
suit
against
firstsouth
in
state
court
alleging
state
law
claims
for
usury
and
breach
of
fiduciary
duty.
two
months
later,
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board
determined
that
firstsouth
was
insolvent,
and
appointed
the
federal
savings
and
loan
insurance
corporation,
the
acronym
for
which
is
fslic,
as
receiver.
fslic
then
substituted
itself
for
firstsouth
in
the
petitioner’s
state
lawsuit
and
had
the
case
removed
to
federal
district
court.
that
court
dismissed
the
suit
for
lack
of
subject-matter
jurisdiction
holding
that
congress
had
given
fslic
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
claims
against
the
assets
of
an
insolvent
savings
and
loans
association
under
receivership.
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
a
conflict
in
the
lower
courts
over
whether
fslic
does
have
exclusive
authority
to
adjudicate
the
validity
of
creditor
state
law
claims
filed
against
insolvent
savings
and
loan
associations
under
fslic
receivership.
we
now
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
for
reasons
explained
in
the
opinion,
we
hold
that
the
statutes
governing
fslic
and
the
bank
board
do
not
grant
fslic
adjudicatory
power
over
creditor's
claims
against
insolvent
savings
and
loan
associations
under
fslic
receivership,
nor
do
they
divest
the
courts
of
jurisdiction
to
consider
those
claims
de
novo.
we
also
hold
that
creditors
are
not
required
to
exhaust
the
bank
board’s
current
administrative
claims
procedure
before
bringing
suit
in
court
because
that
procedure
does
not
place
a
reasonable
time
limit
on
fslic’s
consideration
of
creditor’s
claims
because
an
inadequate
administrative
remedy
need
not
be
exhausted.
the
petitioner
may
proceed
directly
to
court
for
a
de
novo
determination
on
the
merits
of
its
state
law
claims.
justice
blackmun
and
justice
scalia
have
each
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
