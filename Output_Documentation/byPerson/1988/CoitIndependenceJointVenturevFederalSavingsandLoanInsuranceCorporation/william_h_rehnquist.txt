justice

h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
no.
87-996,
coit
independence
joint
venture
v.
fslic.
mr.
goodfriend,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
goodfriend,
fslic
has
retreated
substantially--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--in
this
court
from
the
doctrine
of
the
hudspeth
case.
has
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
has
the
delay
hurt
your
client
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
would
your
be...
but
would
your
being
able
to
get
into
court
earlier
than
you
have
effect
that
at
all--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--because
it's
in
still
a
receivership.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
supposing
the
validity
of
your
claim
had
been
determined
in
a
state
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
it
have
advanced
your
client's
position
so
far
as
his
dollars
and
cents
are
concerned?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
a...
that
would
be
kind
of
unusual
for
a
receivership
to
distribute
in
that
manner,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--is
that
mandated
by
fslic
regulation
now?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
now
we...
let's
assume
that
you're
totally
right
on
the
meaning
of
the
regulation.
we
don't
have
that
particular
problem
before
us.
i
mean,
there's
nothing
in
this
case
that
requires
us
to
consider
the
validity
of
every
single
aspect
of--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--fslic's
regulations.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we...
we
don't
have
before
us...
or
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
we
don't
have
before
us
the
situation
where
fslic
initiates
a
lawsuit
against
a
party.
the
party
seeks
to
counterclaim.
fslic
says,
no,
you
should
have
filed
a
claim.
you...
you
can
no
longer
counter-claim.
that
isn't
present
in
this
case,
is
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
is
fslic
required
to
borrow
from
the
bankruptcy
statute
that
particular
procedure?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
one
can
accept
that
i
think
without
going
as
far
as
you
do
in
suggesting
that
the...
the
receiver
would
have
to
follow
some
provisions
about
interim
distributions
that
aren't
at
all
clear
from
the
statute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we're
talking
here
about
the
standard
by
which
a
court
reviews
fslic's
regulations
not
by
which
a
court
would
review
a
fslic
determination
that
a
claim
wasn't
any
good.
is
that
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
every--
--didn't
the...
didn't
the
regulations
in
salfi
limit
access
to
the
courts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
goodfriend.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
minear.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
there's
a
statute
that
requires
exhaustion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
minear,
is
it
de
novo
judicial
review,
if
you
want
to
call
it
judicial
review,
when
a
person
takes
a
claim
to
court
after
it
has
been
passed
down
by
the
board?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i...
i
think
it's
very
useful.
it
would
be
very
useful
to
me
in
deciding
the
case
because
if
the
fslic
determination
means
absolutely
nothing,
turning
down
the
claim
is
entitled
to
no
weight
in
court,
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
much
point
to
the
whole
procedure.
and
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
fslic
determination
is
entitled
to
some
weight,
then
the...
you
wonder
whether
an
agency
can
by
regulation
cut
off
the...
the
right
to
process
it
in
court
ab
initio.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
where
fslic,
in
effect,
denies
the
claim.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
minear,
after
fslic
turns
down
a
claim,
is
its
denial
of
the
claim
entitled
to
any
weight
in
the
judicial
proceeding?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
does
the
solicitor
general--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what...
what
if
you
want
to
go
to
state
court
and
sue?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you
bring
a
separate
apa
suit
in
federal
court
against
fslic
for
unlawfully
delaying
your
claim
before
you
can
go
into
state
court
and
file
a
claim
on
the
merit.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
people
represented
by
lawyers?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--does...
does
fslic
have
authority
to
foreclose
without
going
to
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
it
depends
on
the
deed
of
trust-mortgage
distinction
basically.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
87-996,
coit
independence
joint
venture
versus
fslic
will
be
announced
by
justice
oâ€™connor.
