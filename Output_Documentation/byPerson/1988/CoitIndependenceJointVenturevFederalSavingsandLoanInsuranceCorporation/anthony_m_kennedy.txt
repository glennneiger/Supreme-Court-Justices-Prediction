justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if...
if
we
rule
in...
generally
in
your
favor,
should
that
include
a
declaration
that
you're
not
required
to
submit
claims
at
all
even
for
notice
purposes?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
i...
i
assume
that
you
have
to
submit
notice
of
claims
to
fslic
within
30
days
under
the
regulations.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
would
conceded
the
authority
of
fslic
under
either
existing
regulations
or
the
existing
statute
to
require
a
notice
of
claim?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
it's
a...
would
you
concede
that
they
can
require
a
mandatory
claims
procedure
to
give
them
notice
of
the
existence
of
the
claim
not
for
adjudication
purposes?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
yes,
it
means
that
before
you
can
go
to
court,
you
have
to
give
them
notice
of
your
claim.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
arguable
that
the
existing
regulations
can
be
interpreted
to
provide
that
there
must
be
notice,
or
would
those--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--regulations
have
to
be
amended?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it,
counsel,
that
fslic
could
request
a
state
or
federal
court
to
stay
the
action
at
the
court's
discretion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
not
exhaustion;
it's
just...
it's
just
a
request
for
stay
so
that
you
can
evaluate
your
position.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
any
court
would
exercise
its
discretion.
you've
been
arguing
that
fslic
has
discretion.
courts
have
discretion
as
well.
