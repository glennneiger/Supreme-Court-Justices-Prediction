justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
merrill,
you
keeping
referring
the...
to
these
charges
as
fees.
i
guess
one
of
the
things
argued
by
the
other
side
is
that
it's
a
tax
not
a
fee.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
must
say
there
is
language
in
national
cable
television
and
other
cases
that
would
indicate
that
fees
are
imposed
on
identifiable
beneficiaries
for
particular
benefits.
and
this
looks
very
much
like
a
tax.
i
guess
your
argument
doesn't
require
us
to
determine
that
it's
a
fee
and
not
a
tax,
but--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--i
find
it
difficult
to
look
at
this
as
anything
but
a
tax.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
merrill,
do
you
think
congress
could
determine
the
total
amount
it
needs
each
year
for
all
government
services
and
obligations
and
then
tell
irs
to
determine
a
rate
and
figure
out
how
to
raise
the
money?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
you
think
congress
could
do
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
this
one
did.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
doesn't
say
that
the
rates
have
to
be
fixed
in
those
bills,
does
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
oklahoma.
the
appellee,
mid-america
pipeline,
owns
and
operates
pipelines
transporting
hazardous
liquids.
as
a
result,
mid-america
is
subject
to
the
hazardous
liquid
pipeline
safety
act,
an
act
that
along
with
the
natural
gas
pipeline
act
is
administered
by
the
secretary
of
transportation.
under
a
provision
of
the
consolidated
omnibus
budget
reconciliation
act
of
1985,
the
secretary
of
transportation
was
required
to
assess
charges
against
parties
regulated
by
either
of
the
pipeline
safety
acts
in
order
to
recover
the
full
cost
of
administering
the
acts.
this
cost
recovery
provision
gives
the
secretary
discretion
to
determine
a
schedule
of
charges
reasonably
related
to
volume-miles,
miles,
revenues,
or
an
appropriate
combination
thereof
of
the
natural
gas
and
hazardous
liquid
pipelines.
in
1986,
the
secretary
assessed
mid-america
charges
totalling
approximately
$50,000
calculated
on
the
basis
of
miles
of
pipeline
owned.
mid-america
paid
the
charges
under
protest
and
sued
the
secretary
in
federal
district
court
claiming
that
the
cost
recovery
provision
amounted
to
an
unconstitutional
delegation
by
congress
of
its
article
i
taxing
powers
to
the
executive
branch.
the
secretary
appealed
the
district
court’s
decision
that
the
cost
recovery
provision
violated
the
non-delegation
doctrine
directly
to
this
court.
for
reasons
explained
in
the
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reaffirm
the
principle
that
so
long
as
congress
provides
an
administrative
agency
with
standards
guiding
its
actions
such
that
a
court
can
ascertain
whether
the
will
of
congress
has
been
obeyed,
no
delegation
of
legislative
authority
violating
the
principle
of
separation
of
powers
has
occurred.
we
hold
that
this
standard
for
measuring
congressional
delegations
of
discretionary
authority
to
the
executive
applies
to
delegations
under
congress’
taxing
power
just
as
it
does
to
congress’
other
enumerated
powers.
the
cost
recovery
provision
of
the
consolidated
omnibus
reconciliation
act
at
issue
here
reflects
congress’
intention
to
delegate
discretionary
authority
to
the
secretary
of
transportation
under
its
taxing
power,
and
it
does
provide
intelligible
guidelines
for
the
exercise
of
that
discretion.
accordingly,
we
find
no
unconstitutional
delegation
of
authority
and
reverse
the
district
court’s
judgment.
the
judgment
is
unanimous.
