chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
87-2098,
samuel
skinner
v.
the
mic-america
pipeline
company.
mr.
merrill?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
refer...
you
continue
to
refer
to
it
as
a
system
of
fees.
but
traditionally
fees
have
been
imposed
on
people
who
get
some
benefit
from...
the
user
fee.
you
know,
you
go
to
a
national
park.
you
camp
overnight.
you
get
something
out
of
it.
here
these
people
aren't
asking
for
safety
controls.
they're
subject
to
the
safety
controls.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
it
enact
a
tax
under
the
commerce
clause?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
would
it
ever
need
to?
i
mean,
if
it's
enacting
a
tax,
why
doesn't
it
proceed
under
the
power
to
levy
taxes?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
you
should
have
no
hesitancy
in
referring
to
these
exactions
as
taxes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
one
can
certainly
agree
wholly
with
that
judgment,
but
regret
that
congress
can't
make
up
its
own
mind
about
some
of
these
things.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you
speak
as
if
rigidity
were
something
to
be
scorned.
but
basically,
the
idea
of
legislation
and
administration
suggests
that,
you
know,
there
is
going
to
be
some
rigidity
in
the
legislation,
that
it
doesn't
entirely
just
lop
over
to
the
administrator.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
merrill.
mr.
mcmillan?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mcmillan,
supposing
in
this
case
that
congress
had
said
this
safety
program
is
costing
us
$100
million
a
year,
we
want
the...
that
money
raised
from
the
pipeline
companies
and
all
of
them,
and
we
want
it
raised
on
a
basis
of
usage
of
the
pipelines.
now,
that
may
be
a
little
bit
different
from
this
case,
but
it's...
to
the
extent
it
is
a
hypothetical.
is...
is
that
unlawful
delegation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
didn't
the
court
in
new
england
power
say
that
congress
had
not
delegated
to
the
fpc?
it
didn't
say
congress
couldn't
have
delegated,
did
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
much...
how
much
discretion
really
is
delegated
here
if
you
say
that
there's
$100
million
to
be
raised?
we
want
it
raised
from
all
pipeline
users.
now,
all
the
agency
has
to
do
is
go
out
and
count
in
that
case.
and
we
want
it
paid...
paid
by
them
or
raised
from
them
on
the
basis
of
pipeline
usage.
you
could
just
refer
to
statistics.
is
the--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
that
simply
means
we
ought
to
get
it
right
in
this
case
i
guess.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
in...
in
this
case
the
congress
had
added
volume
miles
so
that
there
really
was
very
little
discretion
left
in
that
area.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mcmillan.
mr.
merrill,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
merrill.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
87-2098,
skinner
versus
mid-america
pipeline
company
will
be
announced
by
justice
oâ€™connor.
