justice
antonin
scalia
but
i'm
saying
there...
there
is
at
least
that
constitutional
reason
to
have
to
determine
whether
congress
was
proceeding
under
the
taxing
power
or
under
the
commerce
clause.
justice
antonin
scalia
me
too.
you...
me
too.
you...
you'd
want
us
to
review
the...
the...
the
assessment
of
taxes?
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--one
can
say
that
all
other
delegations
of...
of
authority
can
be...
can
be
connected
to
some
executive
activity.
and
you
can
say
it's
really
just
giving
the
executive
discretion
with
respect
to
the
performance
of
some
distinctively
executive
activity.
whereas
taxation
is...
is
so...
so
utterly
independent
of
the
performance
of
any
executive
duties.
well,
congress
gives
the
internal
revenue
service
discretion
in
implementing
the
tax
codes.
there's
a
great
deal
of
discretion
exercised
there.
in
interpreting
the...
the
tax
code,
but
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
and
user
fees
have
the
same
effect
too
and
the
same
attraction
and
are
often
imposed
for
the
same
reason.
justice
antonin
scalia
instead
of
raising
taxes,
you
impose
user
fees.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
congress
telling
an
agency
to
raise
such
taxes
or
such
funds
as
may
be
in
the
public
interest,
convenience
and
necessity,
which
is
a
standard
we've...
we've
approved
in
other
contexts?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
the
point?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but...
but
that...
but
we've...
we've
approved
that
language
in
other
contexts.
is
that
language
okay
for
taxes
too?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
not,
then
there's
a
different
standard
for
taxes.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
your
answer
is
yes.
you
could
say
raise
taxes
or
raise...
raise
funds
to
the
degree
and
in
the
manner
that
is
in
the
public
interest,
convenience
and
necessity.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
all
the
federal
communications
act
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
really.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
really,
for
when
broadcasting
licenses
are
to
be
issued.
there's
not
much
more.
justice
antonin
scalia
hasn't
the
president
been
given
the
power
on
some
occasions
to
establish
the...
the
levels
of...
of
importation
fees
on
oil
and
on
other
matters
as
well?
isn't
that...
isn't
that
a
revenue-raising
measure?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
this
one
less...
less
arithmetic?
because
the
particular
individuals
to
pay
it
are
not...
are
not
as
well
identified?
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i
guess
in
hampton
there
were
a
lot
of
different
ways
of
competing
whether
the
goods
were
being
subsidized
abroad
or
whether...
you
know,
whatever
the
president
had
to
determine
there.
there
were
probably
a
dozen
different
ways
of
going
about
making
that
factual
inquiry.
and
the
president
could
have
decided
to
do
it
in
one
way
or
another.
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
the
president
have...
he
has
all
sorts
of
powers
under
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act.
but
i
recall
that
the
president
has,
on
his
own,
established
import...
import
fees
on...
on
oil.
hasn't...
hasn't...
hasn't
that
happened?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
the
president
could...
could
be
given
the
authority
in
the
event
of
a...
if
he
thinks
the
national
interest
requires
it,
to
impose
an
import
fee
on...
on
petroleum?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
here
he's
acting
under
the
commerce
power,
but
your...
your
argument
is,
yes,
he
may
be
acting
under
the
commerce
power,
but
this
is
raising
revenue.
now,
the
hypo
i
gave
you...
it's
the
same.
he's
acting
under
the
war
power,
under
all
sorts
of
powers,
but
he's
raising
revenue
by...
by
imposing
a...
an
import
fee
on...
on
oil.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
it's
very
hard
to
adopt
an
absolute
rule
that
the
executive
cannot
be
given
discretion
as
to
whether
to
raise
revenue
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
xxx.
what
do
you
do
about
treasury
department
regulations
which...
which
assuredly
determine
who
will
pay
taxes
and
what
rates
will
be
for
particular
individuals?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
lot
of
discretion
as...
as
to
how
to
write
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think...
you
think
that's
a
constitutional
line
between
interpretive
regulations
and...
and
legislative
regulation.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
you...
you
think
this
one
would
be
okay
if
instead
of
what
they
said,
congress
simply
said
you
shall
raise
a
reasonable
amount
of
money
assessed...
by
assessing...
assessing
these
charges
in
a
reasonable
fashion.
then
the
agency
would
have
been
interpreting
the
word
"reasonable"
and
it
would
have
been
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then...
then
the
constitutional
line
has
nothing
to
do
with
interpretive
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
depends
on...
on
how
broad
the
word
you're
interpreting
is.
i
mean,
in
some
agencies,
the...
the
word
is
"reasonable".
and
if
that's
going
to
satisfy
you
that
the
constitution
has
been
complied
with,
so
long
as
you
say,
instead
of
spelling
out
what
they
spelled
out
here,
which
i
think
it
is
a
lot
better,
if
the...
if
the
congress
had
simply
said,
you
know,
impose
a
reasonable...
reasonable
fees
in
a
reasonable
fashion,
then
it
would
all
be
interpretive
and
it's
all
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree
with
that.
i'm
not...
i'm
not
questioning
that.
i'm
just
questioning
whether
you
can
say
that
the
critical
distinction
is
between
whether
it's
interpretive
or
non-interpretive
because
depending
upon
how...
how
vague
the
word
you
are
supposedly
interpreting
it
is,
you
can...
you
can
achieve
equally
undemocratic
results
either
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
that
in
mistretta?
i...
i
don't
recognize
your
description
of
what
the
court
said
in
mistretta
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
good
description
of
the
dissent,
but--
[laughter]
--but
i
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what...
what
was
the
executive
function
that
was
being
performed--
justice
antonin
scalia
--other
than
the
making
of
rules?
justice
antonin
scalia
writing
tax
laws
may
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mcmillan,
i
don't...
tell
you
the
truth,
i
don't
see
what's
so
sacrosanct
about
taxes.
i
mean,
we
have...
we
have
an
agency
here,
the
department
of
transportation,
that
is
allowed
to
adopt
all
sorts
of
rules
with
broad
discretion,
that
can
say
what
i
can
do
or
what
i
can't
do.
they
can
make
things
unlawful.
it's
authorized
even
to
adjudicate
civil
penalties
against
me
for
violating
those
rules.
and
yet,
somehow
we...
we
pass
some...
some
threshold
of
impermissibility
when...
when
they're
given
authority
to
say
how
much
money
is
to
be
raised
from...
from
pipelines.
i...
i
don't
feel
that
i'm
suddenly
in
a...
in
a
new
world
when...
when
that
happens.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--had
we
not
given
transportation
all
these
other
powers,
i
could
understand
it.
but
what's
so...
what's
so
ugly
about
taxes?
i
don't
understand
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
no,
not
legislative
accountability.
house
accountability.
what
it
says
is
when
there
is
a
tax
bill,
it
has
to
be...
originate
in
the
house,
just
as
in
other
areas
it
says
when
there
is
a
bill
on
anything,
it
has
to
pass
both
houses
and
has
to
be
presented
to
the
president.
but
neither
of
those
two
says
when
there
has
to
be
a
bill.
it
just
says
what
must
happen
when
there
is
a
bill.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
that
decision
is
to
be
made
by...
by
law,
as
opposed
to
having
it
made
by
the
executive.
yes.
when
that
is
so,
it
must
be
done
that
way,
just
as
you
can
say
in
other
areas,
whenever
the
decision
is
to
be
made
by
law,
the
senate
has
to
agree
to
it
and
the
house
has
to
agree
to
it
and
the
president
has
to
sign
it.
but
that
doesn't
speak
to
whether
it
must
be
made
by
law
or
can
instead
be
delegated
to
the
president.
justice
antonin
scalia
xxx
so.
i
don't
see
anything
so...
so
quite
different
about
taxes
as
opposed
to...
to
offenses
that...
that
can
be
made
unlawful
by...
by
the
president
without...
without
a
law.
