mr.
richard
mcmillan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case,
of
course,
is
not
whether
the
framers
were
committed
to
the
proposition
that
taxation
and
legislative
accountability
for
taxation
were
important.
that
proposition,
that
elected
representatives
should
be
accountable
for
their
votes
on
tax
matters,
was
accepted
by
everyone.
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
that
deeply
held
belief
was
actually
incorporated
into
the
text
of
the
constitution
so
that
it
actually
binds
congress
today
when
congress
is
not
so
sure
it
likes
the
idea
of
that
accountability.
the
constitution
says
that
"all
bills
for
raising
revenue
shall
originate
in
the
house
of
representatives.
"
and
when
the
constitution
says
"all
bills",
it
is
using
in
constitutional
language
the
only
word
that
meant
law
making.
you
couldn't
pass...
you
couldn't
make
a
law
without
introducing
a
bill.
and
it
might
be
sufficient
to
just
stop
there
and
accept
the
constitution
at
its
word,
that
all
revenue-making
bills
or
laws
must
originate
in
the
house
of
representatives.
mr.
richard
mcmillan,
jr.
section
7005
originated--
mr.
richard
mcmillan,
jr.
--but
the
decision
that
we're
complaining
about
did
not.
the
decision
that
we're
complaining
about
is
setting
a
tax
rate.
you
can't
have
a
revenue-raising
bill
without
setting
a
revenue
rate
or
a
tax
rate.
that
decision
was
not
made
by
congress.
that
decision
was
made
in
the
department
of
transportation.
mr.
richard
mcmillan,
jr.
well,
if
we
take
the
hampton
case,
for
example,
in
hampton,
congress
said
that
they
wanted
a
tariff
equal
to
the
difference
between
the
cost
of
production
at
home
and
abroad.
and
it
asked,
and
properly
asked,
the
executive
to
become
involved
in
the
implementation
of
that
statute
to
determine
over
time
what
the
cost
of
abroad--
mr.
richard
mcmillan,
jr.
--of
production
abroad
and
at
home
were.
but
that
arithmetic
calculation
was...
was
no
more
than
that.
so,
in
that
case,
no.
there
was
not
specific
rate
of
duty
imposed.
mr.
richard
mcmillan,
jr.
no.
this
case
is
not
arithmetic
because
the
agency
was
given
four
ways
to
set
the
tax
rate.
they
could
choose
one
of
four
rates
in
effect.
they
could
base
the
rate
on
miles,
on
volume
miles,
on
revenues
or
some
combination.
and
it
makes
a
big
difference
whether
you
choose
miles
or
volume
miles.
mr.
richard
mcmillan,
jr.
there
is
a
basic
difference
we
think
between
establishing
a
rate
of
tax.
we're
talking
about
revenue
raising
under
the...
under
the
origination
clause.
we
think
there
is
a
basic
difference
between
establishing
that
rate
of
tax
in
the
context
of
taxation
and
making
determinations
about
findings
of
fact,
case-by-case
determinations
in
response
to
changing
conditions
over
time.
that's
what
was
happening
in
hampton.
it
was
a
case
that
involved
regulation
of
commerce.
it
involved
the
imposition
of
duties
on
foreign
commerce
as
a
way
of
regulating
foreign
commerce.
it
did
not
involve
the
setting
of
tax
rates
for
purposes
of
funding
the
federal
government.
mr.
richard
mcmillan,
jr.
i
don't
know.
mr.
richard
mcmillan,
jr.
i
think
the
president...
let
me
give
two
answers
to
that.
first
of
all,
i
think
that
if
the
president
is
acting
under
some
power
other
than
the
taxing
power,
under
the
war
powers
power,
for
example,
then
perhaps
he
could
do
that
under
that
power.
mr.
richard
mcmillan,
jr.
to
me,
your
honor,
the
rule
basically
boils
down
to
whether
or
not
it's
a
zero
sum
game.
revenue
raising...
let
me...
let
me
just
take
the
new
england
power
case
as
an
illustration
of
that
zero
sum
game
principle,
and
new
england
power
i
choose
because
that
involved
natural
gas
pipelines,
just
as
this
case
involves
natural
gas
pipelines.
in
new
england
power,
there
was
a
set
of
regulations.
and
the
government
came
in
and
made
the
argument
that
they're
making
today;
namely,
those
regulations
benefit
these
pipelines.
and
the
court
said
fine.
if
you
can
point
to
a
benefit
that
you
are
conferring
on
a
specific
individual
or
company
by
your
regulatory
action,
fine,
then
charge
them
for
it.
there's
a
quid
pro
quo
involved
there.
something
goes
this
way
and
you
pay
a
fee
in
return
for
it.
but
it
what
you
are
doing
is
raising
revenue
for
the
public
purpose,
if
you
are
doing
something
other
than
simply
trying
to
make
entrepreneurs
rich,
which
was
the
language
justice
douglas
used,
and
are
going
beyond
that
to
satisfy
a
public
purpose,
then
you
are
raising
revenue,
and
when
you
are
raising
revenue,
you
come
under
constitutional
concerns
that
are
different.
i
think
we
can
take
that
much
away
from
national
cable
and
new
england
power.
what
the
difference
is
we
are
here
today
to
decide.
and
the
first
place
we
need
to
look
is
the
origination
clause.
we
can
look
at
the
structure
of
that
clause.
it
is
the
first
enumerated
provision
in
section
7
of
article
i
which
contains
not
only
the
origination
clause,
of
course,
but
the
presentment
clause
and
the
principles
of
bicameralism.
it
has
words
that
are
meaningful.
bills
were
the
constitutional
term
for
law
making.
and
"originate"
in
a
dictionary
at
least
means
to
bring
into
being.
tax
law
making
must
be
brought
into
being
through
bills
in
the
house
of
representatives.
and
we
know
from
looking
at
the
history
of
this
clause,
that
it
symbolized
legislative
accountability
for
tax
matters.
it
was
part
of
the
great
compromise.
it
was
ardently
championed
by
some
of
our
most
famous
forbearers.
and
it
was
a
proposition
not
simply
that
the
executive
should
not
be
involved
in
raising
taxes,
but
that
not
even
the
senate
should
play
the
role
of
originating
that
idea.
mr.
richard
mcmillan,
jr.
it...
well,
this
court
will
have
to
decide
what
a
bill
to
raise
revenue
means.
if
this
court
thinks
you
can
raise
revenue
without
setting
a
rate,
then
a
bill
to
raise
revenue
that
said
nothing
about
rates
wouldn't
be
covered
by
the
origination
clause.
but
if
the
notion
of
the
framers,
if
the
history
of
this
clause
means
anything...
that
is,
that
the
basic
decisions
about
taxes
have
got
to
be
made
by
congressmen...
then
the
decision
about
rates
is
the
central
issue,
perhaps
the
number
one
issue
that
you
have
to
find
in
that
bill
before
you
can
move
past
the
origination
clause
and
even
worry
about
whether
there
are
intelligible
principles
for
doing
something
else.
mr.
richard
mcmillan,
jr.
there
is
a--
mr.
richard
mcmillan,
jr.
--there
is
a
profound
difference
in
fact
between
the
regulations
of
other
agencies
which
this
court
has
approved
as
lawmaking
or
quasi
lawmaking
and
internal
revenue
regulations
which,
as
your
honor
mentioned
in
mr.
merrill's
argument,
are
interpretive.
there
is
a
big
difference
between
the
irs'
role
which
is
to
interpret
what
congress
had...
had
to
say
in
a
way
not
binding
on
this
court
and
an
independent
legislative
sort
of
lawmaking
function
that...
that
we've
seen
with
other
agencies.
so,
i
think--
mr.
richard
mcmillan,
jr.
--i--
mr.
richard
mcmillan,
jr.
--no,
absolutely
not.
i
think--
mr.
richard
mcmillan,
jr.
--no.
i
believe
the
constitutional
line
does.
there
is
a
distinction
between
giving
the
agency
a
lawmaking
function
and
an
interpretive
function.
in
the
interpretive
function
situation,
the
only
lawmaking
body
remains
congress.
and--
mr.
richard
mcmillan,
jr.
--let's
take
that
hypothetical
and
be
specific
about
it.
congress
passes
a
law
that
says
the
irs
set
just
and
reasonable
taxes.
there
are
two
things
wrong
with
that.
first
of
all,
a
point
that
i
was
trying
to
make
and
apparently
haven't
made
very
successfully
is
that
the
interpretive
function,
which
is
all
the
irs
does...
the
interpretive
function
asks
congress...
i
mean,
asks
the
agency
to
decide
what
did
those
words
mean
just...
what
did
those
words
mean.
that's
something...
that
interpretation
then
has
no
law-making
function
and
certainly
couldn't
rise
to
the
level,
we
don't
think,
of
establishing
a
rate,
a
rate
for
tax.
but
even
if
there
was...
even
if
they
said
just
and
reasonable
rates,
there's
a...
there's
a
fundamental
problem
with
whether
or
not
congress
has
made
the
decision.
mr.
richard
mcmillan,
jr.
at
a
practical
level,
perhaps.
i...
i
was
only
trying
to
make
the
point
that
we're
here
to
decide
where
the
law-making
function
ought
to
reside
for
purposes
of
taxation.
and
giving
an
agency
interpretive
power
does
not
transfer
that
law-making
function
away
from
an
agency.
giving
it
law-making...
legislative
rule-making
powers
does.
we
know
why
this
concept
of
legislative
accountability
for
taxation
was
so
important.
we
see
it
in
the
newspapers
regularly.
we...
we
saw
it
in
a...
in
a
somewhat
different
context
recently
when
congress
voted
down
the
congressional
and
judicial
pay
raises.
we
may
not
like
that
result,
but
we
know
why
it
happened.
it
happened
because
congress
had
to
vote,
and
when
congress
has
to
vote
on
an
issue
as
sensitive
as
taxation,
we
know
it's
going
to
affect
the
result,
and
we
know
that's
what
the
framers
intended.
so,
we
do
think
as
a
matter
of
the
first
issue
that
the
origination
clause
is
violated
here,
that
if
you
look
at
the
structure
of
that
clause,
at
the
words
that
it
uses,
at
the
history
of
that
clause,
you
can
only
conclude
that
the
decision
made
here
by
the
department
of
transportation
did
not
originate
in
a
bill
of
the
house.
it
originated
in
a
notice
in
the
federal
register.
there
is
a
second
issue
which
we
have
raised
in
the
alternative
to
the
origination
clause
issue,
which
posits
the
question
of
what
if
the
origination
clause
is
not
by
itself
dispositive
of
whether
or
not
some...
someone
other
than
congress
can
tax.
it
has
to
do
with
what
we
mean
by
the
term
"execution
of
the
laws"
in
the
context
of
taxation.
let
me
start
with
a
proposition
that
i
don't
think
will
be
disputed.
the
congress
cannot
delegate
legislative
power
to
the
president
is
a
principle
universally
recognized
as
vital
to
the
integrity
and
maintenance
of
the
system
of
government
ordained
by
the
constitution.
that
quote
from
field
and
clark
has
been
quoted
innumerable
times
in
decisions
of
this
court.
the
question
is
does
it
mean
anything.
without
reaching
the
issue
of
taxation,
the
context
of
taxation
here,
i
think
we
can
begin
with
the
proposition
that
whenever
this
court
has
sustained
the
delegation
of
law
making
to
an
agency,
it
has
always
been
a
predicate
for
that
ruling,
that
there
was
something
to
execute.
there
was
some
program
to
implement.
there
were
case-by-case
determinations
over
time
in
response
to
changing
conditions
or
whatever.
we
found
that
in
hampton.
it
was
true
in
mistretta.
in
short,
there
has
to
be
a
program
to
execute,
perhaps
details
to
fill
in
with
respect
to
that
program,
but
not
the
central
issue
of
how
much
someone
is
going
to
pay,
not
simply
a
decision
to
make.
and
we
know
that
the--
mr.
richard
mcmillan,
jr.
--the
court
in
mistretta--
mr.
richard
mcmillan,
jr.
--the--
mr.
richard
mcmillan,
jr.
--the--
mr.
richard
mcmillan,
jr.
--the
quote
from
mistretta
that
i
was
referring
to
was
this.
"developing
proportionate
penalties
for
hundreds
of
different
crimes
by
virtually
a
limitless
array
of
offenders
is
precisely
the
sort
of
intricate,
labor-intensive
task
for
which
delegation
to
an
expert
body
is
especially
appropriate.
"
mr.
richard
mcmillan,
jr.
the
department
of
transportation
has
never
been
thought
of
as
a
expert
agency
on
writing
tax
laws.
this...
this
court
in
the
lichter
case
and
in
other
cases
has,
in
looking
at
what
we
mean
by
execution
of
the
law
and
delegation,
held
specifically
that
we
ought
to
be
concerned
with
the
nature
of
the
power
that
is
being
invoked.
in
lichter
it
was
a
war
powers
situation,
and
the
court
found
that
in
that
context,
there
was...
it
was
particularly
appropriate
to
find
the
delegation.
and
in--
mr.
richard
mcmillan,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
richard
mcmillan,
jr.
it...
it
is
really
precisely
the
new
england
power
fact
pattern
in
a
sense.
it's
really
exactly
new
england
power.
mr.
richard
mcmillan,
jr.
the
court
didn't
reach
the
third...
they
reached
two
issues
and
didn't
reach
a
third.
they
found
this
is
unquestionably
taxes.
they
found
that
the
label,
the
tax
label,
makes
a
difference
for
constitutional
purposes,
but
on
the
third
issue,
what
difference
does
it
make,
they
didn't
reach
it.
we're
here
today
to
argue
that
the
taxing
power,
that
is,
the
basic
decisions
about
raising
revenue,
including
the
most
central
decision
of
all,
who
was
going
to
pay
how
much,
cannot
be
delegated
to
an
agency
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
standard
is
usage
or
something
else
that's--
mr.
richard
mcmillan,
jr.
--mid-america
is
here
not
because
it
cares
how
much
the
industry
is
going
to
pay.
mid-america
is
here
because
if
you
choose
miles,
as
distinguished
from
volume
miles,
the
tax
we
pay
is
very
different.
and
there
is
no
distinction.
we
talk
about
$100
million
or
$9
million.
there
is
no
distinction
between
the
dot
program
here
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission
or
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
or
the
federal
aviation
administration
or
any
number
of
other
agencies.
mr.
richard
mcmillan,
jr.
we...
we
should
get
it
right
in
this
case.
absolutely.
we
should
expect
that
the
financing
of
a
major
part
of
the
federal
government
by
taxes
is
going
to
be
made
according
to
a
set
of
basic
decisions
made
in
congress.
mr.
richard
mcmillan,
jr.
if
they
had
said
volume
miles,
then
we're...
we
wouldn't
be
here
because
that...
there
isn't
any
discretion.
that
is
the
selection
of
a
formula
which
you
go
out
to
the
industry
and
find
out
what
are
the
volume
miles
which...
for
your
pipeline,
what
are
for
you.
you
plug
that
into
a
pocket
calculator,
and
out
comes
the
number.
mr.
richard
mcmillan,
jr.
well--
mr.
richard
mcmillan,
jr.
--well,
with
all
due
respect,
your
honor,
i
don't...
it's
not
a
question
of
whether
you
feel
uncomfortable
or
i
feel
uncomfortable
or
even
whether
the
framers
felt
uncomfortable.
the
question
is
what
does
the
constitution
require,
and
there
is
no
way
of
understanding
the
origination
clause
and
where
it
traces
from
without
understanding
that
as
a
symbol
of
legislative
accountability
in
the
tax
area.
mr.
richard
mcmillan,
jr.
it
means
legislative
accountability
and
house
accountability.
it
means
not
only
will
the
executive
not
be
involved
in
this
decision,
but
even
the
senate's
involvement
will
be
limited.
that's
the...
that's
what
the
framers
had
in
mind
and
that's
what's--
mr.
richard
mcmillan,
jr.
--we
are
here
today
arguing
that
the
decision
about
what
mid-america
is
going
to
pay,
what
its
tax
rate
is
going
to
be
can
only
be
made
by
law.
i
don't
think
that's
a
particularly
surprising
provision.
that's
what
the
constitution
says.
mr.
richard
mcmillan,
jr.
offense...
offenses
are
a
zero
sum
game
in
the
way
that
revenue
raising
isn't.
if
you
do
something
wrong,
your...
you
pay
back
for
it.
you...
you
pay
to
make
it
right,
so
to
speak.
that's
a
zero
sum
game
that
comes
in
under
a
different
sort
of
a...
of
a
constitutional
power.
when
you
raise
revenue
for
the
public
good
for
discretionary
spending,
that
is
a
issue
that
is
covered
by
a
discrete
set
of
constitutional
provisions.
there's
no
way
to
get
away
from
the
fact
that
the
constitution
treats
taxation
differently
than
it
treats
other
powers,
not
only
in
the
origination
clause
but
in
other
clauses.
taxation
is
different
under
the
constitution.
mid-america
is
here
sharing
some
of
the...
some
of
those
original
concerns.
tax
should
be
called
a
tax.
if
someone
is
going
to
decide
what
mid-america
is
going
to
pay
to
support
this
program,
it
ought
to
be
congress.
it
ought
not
to
be
an
invisible
employee
of
the
department
of
transportation.
mr.
richard
mcmillan,
jr.
the
court
in
national
cable
i
think
found
that
if
you
are
talking
about
a
user
fee,
it
doesn't
rise
to
the
level
of
something
that
the
constitutional
concerns
associated
with
taxation
are
concerned
about.
mr.
richard
mcmillan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
richard
mcmillan,
jr.
in
closing,
i
would
just
go
back
to
a
point
that
i
started
with
that
the
decision
we
are
talking
here
originated
in
the
department
of
transportation.
there
is
a
difference
between
bills
for
raising
revenue
and
notices
in
the
federal
register.
thank
you.
