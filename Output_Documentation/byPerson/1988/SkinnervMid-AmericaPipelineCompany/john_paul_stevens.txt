of
course,
the
origination
clause
doesn't
use
the
word
"tax"
either.
it's
a
bill
for
raising
revenue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
and
the
question
i
suppose
is...
one
of
the
preliminary
questions
is
whether
this
is
a
bill
for
raising
revenue
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
submit
it
is
not
i
gather.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
not
fixing
rates.
justice
john
paul
stevens
nor
does
congress
tell
irs
how
much
money
to
raise.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
they're
supposed
to
get
100
percent
of
their
costs
of
operating
the
program,
aren't
they?
isn't
the...
the
purpose
of
the
fee
schedule
to
reimburse
the
agency
for
its
costs
of
operation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
see,
if
this...
if
this
program
is
permissible,
this
is
a
way
of
raising
additional
revenues
without
increasing
taxes,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
yes,
but
the
standard
that
justice
scalia
suggests
would
also
appear
in
the
history
of...
history
of
appropriations
and
the
agency
spent
a
certain
amount
of
money
over
the
years,
and
that
sort
of...
they
could
decide
what
degree
of
activity
of
their
own
was
in
the
public
interest.
xxx.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
much...
how
much
damage
would
be
done
to...
to
our
prior
history
in
cases
if
we
simply
held
that
the
taxing
power
is
non-delegable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
rules
for
raising
revenue
have
to
originate
in
the
house
and
follow
the
procedure.
that's
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask?
under
your
view
if
the
congress
delegated
to
the
department
of
transportation
the
decision
of
which
roads
in
the
federal
highway
system
should
become
toll
roads
and
to
set
the
right
rates
in
an
effort
to
reimburse
the
government
for
the
cost
of
the
roads,
would
that
be
permissible?
and
they
charge
a
user
fee
in
the
form
of
tolls,
but
the
purpose
of
the
user
fee
would
be
to
pay
back
the
government
for
building
the
roads.
and
now
would
that
be
different
from
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
that
would
be
all
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
