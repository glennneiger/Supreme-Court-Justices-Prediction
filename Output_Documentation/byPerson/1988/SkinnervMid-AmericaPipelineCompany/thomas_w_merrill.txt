mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
concerns
the
constitutionality
of
a
system
of
fees
established
by
congress
in
section
7005
of
the
consolidated
omnibus
budget
reconciliation
act
of
1986.
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
oklahoma,
adopting
the
report
of
a
magistrate,
held
that
the
statute
is
an
unconstitutional
delegation
of
congress'
power
of
taxation.
the
case
is
here
on
a
direct
appeal
from
that
judgment.
the
appellee
does
not
argue
in
its
brief
that
section
7005
violates
the
general
non-delegation
principles
articulated...
articulated
by
this
court
in
its
decisions
beginning
with
j.
w.
hampton
and
company
v.
united
states
and
most
recently
in
mistretta
v.
united
states.
instead,
appellee
argues
that...
that
the
case
does
not
come
within
the
terms
of
the
ordinary
delegation
doctrine
for
two
reasons.
first,
appellee
contends
that
the
power
of
taxation
is
subject
to
a
special
and
highly
restrictive
version
of
the
non-delegation
principle.
and
second,
appellee
contends
that
the
fees
that
were
imposed
by
section
7005
cannot
be
sustained
as
an
exercise
of
any
power
of
congress
except
its
power
of
taxation.
i'd
like
to
turn
to
those
two
arguments
in
a
moment,
but
first
i
think
it
would
be
useful
to
spend
a
little
time
looking
at
the...
the
provisions
of
the
statute
that
is
at
issue
here,
section
7005,
because
when
we
do
that,
i
think
you'll
see
that
congress
has,
in
fact,
given
the
executive
very
little
discretion
in
this
particular
statute.
in
fact,
congress
itself
made
most
of
the
crucial
policy
decisions
implicated
by
this
particular
system
of
fees.
congress
provided
in
the
statute
quite
clearly
that
it
was
to
apply
to
only
one
agency,
the
department
of
transportation.
this
is
not
an
omnibus
bill
that
applies
to...
across
the
board
to
all
federal
agencies.
congress
articulated
quite
clearly
its
policy.
it
wanted
a
system
of
fees
established
that
would
recover
the
costs
that
the
department
of
transportation
incurs
in
implementing
two
pipeline
safety
programs,
the
natural
gas
pipeline
safety
act
and
the
hazardous
liquids
pipeline
safety
act.
subsection
d
of
section
7005
imposes
a
precise
ceiling
on
the
total
amount
of
fees
that
can
be
collected
in
any
given
year.
it
cannot
exceed
105
percent
of
the
annual
appropriations
established
by
congress
for
both
of
these
pipeline
programs.
in
subsection
c
of
the
statute,
congress
adopts
another
limitation
providing
that
the
fees
can
be
used
only
for
one
purpose.
they
can
only
be
used
to
support
the
agency's
activities
under
these
two
pipeline
programs
and
not
for
any
other
purpose.
subsection
a(3)
and
subsection
d
of
the
act
both
specify
exactly
who
is
to
pay
these
fees.
they
are
to
be
paid
by
all
natural
gas
pipeline
transmission
companies
and
by
all
liquid...
hazardous
liquid
pipeline
companies.
and
finally,
the
only
area
of
the
statute
that
really
provides
for
any
degree
of
discretion
at
all
is
the
section
that
sets
forth
how
the
fees
are
to
be
established,
and
that's
subsection
a(1)
of
section
7005.
and
if
we
look
at
that
section
carefully,
you
will
see
that
congress,
in
fact,
adopted
no
less
than
four
constraints
on
the
exercise
of
discretion
by
the
department
of
transportation
in
setting
the
fee
schedule.
first
of
all,
if
the
statute
is
read
carefully,
you
will
see
that
it
adopts
a
single
principle
that
the
department
of
transportation
is
to
follow
in
establishing
fees.
fees
are
to
be
based
on
pipeline
usage.
secondly--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
well,
as
i...
i
mentioned--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--as
i
mentioned
very
briefly,
the
appellees
really
have
to
sustain
two
propositions
in
order
to
win
here,
and
if
they
don't
sustain
on...
sustain
both
propositions,
they
lose.
the
first
is
that
congress
is
subject
to
some
special
restriction
on
delegation
under
the
taxing
power,
and
the
second
is
that
this
system
of
fees
could
only
be
justified
as
an
exercise
of
the
taxing
power
and
not
as
an
exercise
of
the
commerce
power.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
that's
true,
your
honor.
recall,
however,
the
constitution
doesn't
use
the
word
"fees"
and
we're
talking
about
an
issue
of
constitutional
law.
the
issue
of...
the
second
issue
of
constitutional
law
presented
we
think
is
whether
or
not
congress
had
to
be
acting
under
the
taxing
power
or
whether
it
could
be
acting
some...
under
some
other
power
such
as
the
commerce
power.
now,
it's
true
that
the
word
"fee"
traditionally
has
a
connotation
of
something
like
a
user
fee
or
some
exaction
in
return
for
a
benefit.
that's
what
the
independent
offices
appropriations
act
is
about,
and
that's
what
this
court
had
before
it
in
the
national
cable
television
case
and
in
the
new
england
power
case.
but
if
you
think
about
the
commerce
clause
and
what
congress
can
do
under
the
commerce
clause,
i
don't
think
it
be...
can
be
contended
that
the
only
thing
congress
can
enact
is
a
fee
in
that
technical
sense
of...
of
some
charge
imposed
in
return
for
a
benefit.
congress
passes
statutes
containing
civil
penalties,
criminal
fines.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
i
don't
think
that
congress
could
enact
a...
a
pure
tax
under
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
the
truth
is
i
think,
justice
rehnquist,
that
congress
doesn't
specify
what
clause
of
the
constitution
it's
proceeding
under
when
it
adopts
these
sorts
of
things.
and
i
think
one
of
our
points
would
be
that...
that
this
court
should
not
force
congress
to
do
that
and
should
not
force
courts
to
do
that
by
articulating
a
different
delegation
standard
that
would
apply
depending
on
which
power
congress
is,
in
fact,
operating
under.
that's
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
think
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
say
that
there
are
two
radically
different
standards
of
delegation
and
which
one
you
apply
would
depend
on
which
power
of
congress
we
determined
congress
to
be
acting
under.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
well,
i
refer
to
them
as
fees
because
congress
referred
to
them
as
fees.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
that's
what
the
statute
says.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
this
bill
did
originate
in
the
house,
justice
scalia,
but
no
claim
has
been
raised
in
this
case
under
the
origination
clause.
the
appellee--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--yes.
there...
there
may
be
reasons
that
arise
in
the
constitution
that
require
the
court
to
determine
what
a
tax
is,
although
the
cases
i
believe
under
the
origination
clause
have
been
very
reluctant
to
define
with
any
precision
exactly
what
a
tax
is.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
in
this
case
i
don't
think
the
court
has
to
come
up
with
some
constitutional
definition
of
what
a
fee
is.
the
constitution
doesn't
use
the
word
"fee".
the
constitution
grants
congress
broad
power
under
the
commerce
clause.
xxx.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
revenue.
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
that
could
potentially
be
a
question.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
the
word
"revenue"
conceivably
could
have
a
different
scope
than
the
word
"tax".
i
understand,
for
example,
that
the
house
traditionally
argued
that
revenue
included
appropriations
as
well
as
taxing
bills.
the
senate
disagreed
with
that.
so,
there's...
there
are
a
lot
of
untested
issues
that
could
conceivably
be
raised
by
the
origination
clause.
but
again,
no
claim
has
been
made
in
this
case
that
this
particular
provision
violates
the
origination
clause.
the
origination
clause
came
in
through
the
side
door
in
appellee's
brief
in
order
to
try
to
substantiate
its
more
general
argument
about
delegation.
let...
let
me,
if
i
can,
though
just...
just
complete
noting
the
provisions
in
the
statute
that
govern
the
setting
of
these
fees
because
i
think
it
is
an
important
point.
the
statute
sets
forth
a
single
criterion
for
determining
fees:
pipeline
usage.
it's
not
a
multiple
choice
test
in
the
sense
that
the
appellees
suggest.
the
statute
does
go
on
to
set
forth
three
factors
that
the
agency
can
look
at
in
trying
to
determine
pipeline
usage,
but
the
ultimate
standard
that
congress
enunciated
was
pipeline
usage.
the
statute
also
says
that...
that
in...
in
determining
pipeline
usage
by
those
factors
that
there
must
be
a
reasonable
relationship
between
those
factors
and
the
determination
of
pipeline
usage.
and
finally,
the
statute
says
that
in
establishing
the
schedule,
the
secretary
shall
take
into
account...
take
into
consideration
the
allocation
of
departmental
resources.
so,
what
we
have
here
really
is
a...
is
by
modern
standards
a
highly
precise
statute,
one
that
sets
forth
a
number
of
constraints
on
the
discretion
of
the
secretary
of
transportation,
and
sets
forth
really
four
limitations
on
the
type
of...
the
schedule
of
fees
that
can
be
adopted.
i
don't
think
that
any
serious
claim
could
be
made
that
this
statute
violates
the
intelligible
principles
standard
of
the
j.
w.
hampton
case
which
this
court
has
most
consistently
applied
in
delegation
cases.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
that,
obviously,
would
be
a
far
cry
from
what
we
have
before
us
in
this
particular
case.
our
contention...
and
i...
i
will
get
to
it
presently
is
that
there
should
be
no
distinction
in
terms
of
the
delegation
standard
that
this
court
applies
to
taxes
as
opposed
to
fees.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
if
congress
set
forth
a
standard
to
confine
the
discretion
of
the
agency
and...
and
indicated
its
policy
and
did
so
in
a
way
that
meant
that
the
agency's
actions
were
subject
to
meaningful
judicial
review,
yes,
i
think
congress
can
do
that.
that
strikes
us
as
odd.
that
strikes
as
sort
of
different
from
the
traditions
that
we've
come
to
expect
in
the
area
of
taxation.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
well,
i
don't
know
that
i
would
want
the
court
to
review
it
under
the
delegation
doctrine
any
differently
than
the
court
has...
has
reviewed
other
major
enactments
under
the
delegation
doctrine.
i
think
it...
it
strikes
us
as
odd
under
our
traditions,
but
those
traditions
have
not
been
developed
under
the
compulsion
of
any
holding
by
this
court
about
the
meaning
of
the
power
of
taxation
and
how
far
congress
has
to
go
in...
in
legislating
with
specificity
under
the
taxing
power.
the...
congress
itself
is
responsible
for
having
generated
that
tradition,
and
there's
no
reason
to
think
at
this
point
that
congress
is
about
to
abdicate
or
to
give
away
that...
that
power
which
it
has
rather
jealously
protected
over
the
years.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
certainly
nothing
in
this
statute
suggests
that
congress
is
about
ready
to
abdicate
in
its...
in
its
powers.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
and
in
promulgating
regulations,
including
legislative
regulations
in
some
circumstances.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
generally,
yes.
congress
does
not
tell
the
irs
to
fix
rates.
but
i
don't
think
that
fixing
rates
can
somehow
be
singled
out
or
zeroed
in
on
as...
as
a...
as
a...
as
a
unique
function
as
to
which
there
can
be
absolutely
no
delegation
by
congress
whatsoever.
after
all,
fixing
rates
was
exactly
what
was
at
issue
in
the
j.
w.
hampton
case.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
nor
does
congress
tell
irs...
congress
did
not
tell
the
dot
how
much
money
to
raise
in
this
case
either.
dot
can...
is...
has...
is
subject
to
a
fixed
limitation
in
any
given
year
of
105
percent
of
its
annual
appropriations,
and
over
time--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--that's
correct.
if
the
fee
schedule
works
correctly,
if
they're
not...
if
the
collection
of
the
fees
is
reasonably
complete,
over
time
the
agency
will
recover
100
percent
of
its
appropriated
costs.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
yes.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
and,
in
fact,
the
legislative
history...
i
would
have
to
be
candid...
suggests
that
the
primary
motivation
for
enacting
the
statute
was
concern
with
the
federal
deficit.
but
i
don't
think
that
that
means
it's
unconstitutional
as
an
unconstitutional
delegation
of
power
because
if
you
look
at
the
statute,
the...
the
discretion
is
channeled
quite
narrowly
here.
and
we
see
no
principal
basis
in
the
constitution
for
a
distinct
delegation
doctrine
with
respect
to
taxes
as...
as
opposed
to
the
regulation
of
interstate
commerce.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
yes.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
yes,
yes.
i
mean,
if
you
look
at
the
history
of
the
ioaa,
for
example,
in
1952,
there's
a
footnote
in
the
national
cable
case
which
recites
a
little
bit
of
that
history
and
indicates
that
congress'
motivation
there
was
to
reimburse
the
government
for
some
of
the
expenses
that
it
was
incurring
in
providing
benefits,
privileges
and
licenses
to
people.
what
congress
thought
here
was
we
have
an
industry
which
is
engaged
in
an
inherently
dangerous
activity,
transporting
natural
gas
and
oil
through
pipelines.
we've
adopted
a
regulatory
program,
and
in
order
to
try
and
limit
those
dangers,
and
doesn't
it
makes
sense
that
the
costs
of
doing
that
should
be
borne
by
the
industry?
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
congress
made
up
its
mind
in
this
case.
if
you...
if
the
principle
that
congress
is
operating
under
is
that
it
wants
an
industry
to
bear
the
costs
of
a
program,
it
seems
sensible
to
me
for
congress
to
direct
the
agency
to
establish
the
schedule
of
fees
that
is
going
to
apportion
those
costs
according
to
the
degree
to
which
each
company
in
the
industry
is,
in
fact,
creating
the
costs.
congress
could
do
it
by
some
kind
of
fixed
formula
saying
that
the
fees
shall
be
x
percent
or
something
like
that,
but
that
would
be
more
rigid
and
in
a
sense
make
less
sense
than
simply
telling
the
agency
to
do
it.
and
the
agency's
discretion
here
is
not...
is
not
broad.
they're
supposed
to
do
it
according
to
pipeline
usage.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
i
agree
with
that.
and
in
the...
in
the
taxation
area,
pure
and
simple,
when
we're
talking
about
raising
revenues
in
order
to
support
public
goods
like
defense
and
the
national
welfare
system,
rather
than
recovering
the
costs
that...
that
the
government
has
incurred
in
a
particular
program,
that
type
of...
of...
of
rigidity
and...
and
setting
of
fixed
rates
based
on
broad
distributional
considerations
and
other
factors
makes
complete
sense.
and
congress,
in
fact,
routinely
does
that.
but
when
congress
decides
that
it
wants
to
recover
the
costs
of
a
particular
program
from
the
persons
who
are
responsible
for
that
program,
for
the...
for
the
need
for
that
program,
i
don't
think
it's
inappropriate
for
congress
to
say
that...
that
some
discretion
should
be
given
to
the
agency
in
the
apportionment
of
those
costs
among
the
people
responsible
for
the...
giving
rise
to
the
need
for
the
program
in
the
first
place.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
well,
justice
scalia,
at
some
point,
obviously,
you
would
start
bumping
up
against--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--the
limitations
that
the
court
identified
in
the
schechter
poultry
case,
for
example.
i
mean--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--i...
our
submission--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--our
submission
is
that
the
same
standard
that
the
court
has
articulated
in
the
non-delegation
context
generally
should
be
applied
to
exercises
of
the
power
of
taxation.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
well,
if
that's
all
the
statute
said,
i
think
it
would
raise
questions--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--well,
it
says
more
than
that.
i
mean,
it--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--that...
that's
a
particular
standard
for
award
of
licenses.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
the
standard
for
setting...
awarding
a
license
or
setting
a
rate,
but
that
standard
appears
within
the
context
of
a
whole
administrative
mechanism
which
has
been
set
up
by
congress
with
general
statements
of
purpose--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--yes.
i
will
admit
that...
that
these...
these...
these
problems
are
troubling,
that
they
seem
to
be
contrary
to
the
traditions
that
we've
operated
under.
but
i
would...
i
would
remind
the
court
about
some
of
the
reasons
that...
that
the
court
has
cited
for
not
applying
a
highly
strict
delegation
standard
in
the
commerce
context
and
would
suggest
that
those
same
reasons
would
also
apply
in
the
context
of
taxation.
now,
the
two
primary
reasons
i
think,
first
of
all,
are
just
simple
a
practical
problem
that
when
you're
operating
a
government
the
size
of
the
federal
government,
congress
can't
make
all
the
policy
decisions
itself.
it
has
to
utilize
the
executive
branch
or
the...
or
executive
agencies
to
decide
supplementary
issues
of
policy.
that
has
been
a
primary
factor
that
has
been
cited
in
this
court
in
its
cases.
the
second
is
a
definitional
problem.
if
you're
going
to
draw
the
line
between
somehow
fundamental
policy
issues
and
non-fundamental
policy
issues,
how
can
the
court
develop
a
workable
standard
for
differentiating
between
those
two
types
of
questions.
that's...
those
sort
of
considerations
have
haunted
the
delegation
doctrine
in...
in
the
context...
in
the
traditional
context.
and
i
think
they
would
be
equally
applicable
here.
appellees
say,
well,
it's
different
when
we're
talking
about
the
allocation
of
the
tax
burden.
that's
somehow
special.
but
the
allocation
of
the
tax
burden
is
not
just
simply
a
function
of
tax
rates.
it's
a
function
of
the
definition
of
income.
it's
the
function
of
what's
deductible.
it's
the
function
of
what
kind
of
credits
you
get.
and
the
internal
revenue,
for
example,
has
to
exercise
a
lot
of
discretion
in
a
lot
of
areas
in
determining
those
things.
and
so,
the
ultimate
allocation
of
a
tax
burden
is
not
something
that
congress
itself
can
make
every...
every...
every
single
decision
about.
and
so,
we...
we
just...
appellees
have
not
suggested
really
a
meaningful
intermediate
standard
for
delegation
that
would
apply
to
the
taxation
[inaudible],
but
not
to
the--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--if
you
held
that
the
taxing
power
was
non-delegable?
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
well,
i
don't
know
what
that
would
mean.
i
mean,
the
taxing
power
is
non-delegable.
the
commerce
power
is
non-delegable.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
semantically
i
don't
think
the
correct
reading
of
this
court's
cases
is
that
any
of
congress'
powers
are
delegable
in
the
sense
that
the
entire
power
can
be
transferred
to
somebody
else.
the
issue
this
raises
is
how
much
discretion
can
congress
give
to
the
executive
in
implementing
statutes
that
it
enacts
pursuant
to
its
multiple
powers.
we
think
in
answering
that
question,
how
much
discretion
can
you
give
before
you
have
somehow
deemed
to
have
delegated
or
deemed
to
have
abdicated
that
the
court...
that
the
only
standard
we
can
think
of...
the
only
standard
that
anybody
has
really
suggested
is
the
standard
of
j.
w.
hampton
and
schechter
poultry
and
so
forth.
and...
and
for
the
court
to
somehow
suggest
that
taxation
is
different
would
send
us
down
the
road
of
having
to
consider
all
sorts
of
challenges
to
tax
statutes
in
a
variety
of
contexts
based
on
the
need,
first
of
all,
to
come
up
with
an
abstract
definition
of
taxes
as
opposed
to
something
else
and
then,
secondly,
to
try
and
figure
out
what
this
new
delegation
standard
actually
means.
appellees
have
identified
nothing
in
the
text
of
the
constitution
that
would
differentiate
the
taxing
power
from
the
commerce
power.
they
certainly
don't
suggest
that
article
i,
section
8,
clause
1,
which
sets
forth
the
power
to
lay
and
collect
taxes
itself,
provides
a
textual
basis.
they
focused
almost
exclusively
on
the
origination
clause.
i
think
there
are
three
reasons
why
the
origination
clause
cannot
plausibly
be
cited
as
a
source
for
some
kind
of
hyper
delegation
standard
that
applies
only
to
taxation.
first
of
all,
the
origination
clause
doesn't
say
anything
more
about
the
degree
of
precision
that
congress
has
to
use
in
passing
tax
statutes
than
does
article
i,
section
8,
the
taxing
clause
itself.
secondly,
insofar
as
the
origination
clause
can
be
read
as
reflecting
a
policy
judgment
by
the
framers
that
issues
of
taxation
should
remain
closer
to
the
people
than
other
types
of
decisions,
the
framers
provided
a
procedural
mechanism
for
realizing
that
policy.
they
said
that
tax
bills
had
to
originate
in
the
house.
this
bill
did
originate
in
the
house.
there's
no
dispute
about
that,
and
so
the
procedural
mechanism
that
congress
adopted
to
vindicate
its
policy
has
been
satisfied.
finally,
appellees
have
quoted
to
the
court
the
first
half
of
the
origination
clause
which
says
that
"all
bills
for
raising
revenue
shall
originate
in
the
house
of
representatives.
"
but
they
haven't
quoted
or
relied
on
the
second
half
of
the
origination
clause
which
says
"but
the
senate
may
propose
or
concur.
"
in
"amendments
as
on
other
bills".
so,
unlike
the
british
tradition,
for
example,
where
the
house
of
commons
got
to
initiate
revenue
measures
and
the
house
of
lords
could
only
approve
or
disapprove,
vote
up
or
down
on
that,
the
framers
rejected
that
and
gave
the
senate
the
power
to
amend
or
propose
alternative
measures
even
though
the
bills
are
originated
by
the
house.
this
is
a
much
more
diluted
principle
of
popular
accountability
than
one
would
have
under
the
british
system
or
that
one
would
have
if
all
you
had
was
the
first
half
of
the
origination
clause.
and
we
don't
understand
how
you
get
from
that
diluted
principle
of
accountability,
how
you
make
the
logical
leap
from
that
to
the
proposition
that
congress
can
give
the
executive
no
discretion
in
implementing
the
tax
laws.
there
seems
to
be
too
much
of
a...
of
a
gulf
there
in
order
to
sustain
the
proposition
the
appellee
wants
to
sustain.
let
me
turn
to
the
second--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--well--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--the
appellees
have
argued,
justice
kennedy,
that
you
can
find
this
policy
in
the
origination
clause
that
says
that
matters
of
taxes
have
to
be
kept
close
to
the
people.
the
house
of
representatives
at
the
time
the
constitution
was
framed
was
directly
elected,
but
the
senate
was
not.
and
so,
appellees
concluded
from
that
matters
of
tax
have
to
be
decided
by
what
today
are...
are
both
the
house
and
the
elected
senate
to
a
greater
extent
than
can
be
decided
by
an
executive
branch
agency
which
is
only--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--the
origination
clause,
of
course,
still
applies.
they're
not...
and
they're
not
disputing
that
it
was
violated
in
this
case.
they're
trying
to
find
this
policy
in
it.
and
all
i'm
suggesting
is--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--no.
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
if
there
is
a
policy
of
popular
accountability,
it's
not
the
dramatic
one
they
suggest.
it's
a
qualified
one
because
the
senate,
at
the
time
the
constitution
was
adopted,
was
not
directly
elected
and
that
the
framers
contemplated
that
the
senate
would
have
the
power
to
propose
amendments
to
revenue
bills
which,
of
course,
today
the
senate
is
directly
elected
by
the
people,
and
so
we
have
perhaps
more
accountability
than
the
framers
even
anticipated
under
the
origination
clause.
let
me
make
just
one
quick
point
about
the
second
issue:
is
this
a
tax
or
is
this
a
fee?
i
don't
think
that's
the
correct
way
to
ask
the
question.
the
correct
way
to
ask
the
question
is
could
congress
adopt
this
provision
under
its
commerce
power.
and
i
think
if
you
think
quickly
about
two
hypothetical...
or
two
statutes,
you
can
see
my
point
that
congress
ought
to
be
able
to
have
the
power
under
the
commerce
clause
to
enact
this
particular
statute.
one
statute
would
impose
strict
liability
on
all
pipelines
for
accidents
caused
by
the
pipeline...
fires,
explosions
and
so
forth...
and
would
require
the
pipelines
to
pay
damages
to
persons
that
are
injured.
the
second
statute
would
adopt
a
scheme
of
regulation
setting
the
safety
standards
and
enforcement
to
ensure
that
accidents
don't
happen,
and
then
imposes
on
the
pipelines
the
costs
of
paying
for
that
scheme
of
regulation.
the
second
statute
is
really
what
we
have
in
this
case.
i
can't
see
any
question
that
the
first
statute
would
be
sustainable
under
the
commerce
power,
and
if
that's
the
case,
i
think
the
second
ought
to
be
sustainable
under
the
commerce
power
as
well.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
might.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
two
quick
points.
first,
with
respect
to
the
argument
that
the
dot
regulations
violate
the
origination
clause
in
this
case
because
the
regulations
didn't
originate
in
the
house
of
representatives,
that
argument
would
call
into
question
the
validity
of
every
single
regulation
issued
by
the
treasury
department.
and
it's
simply
not
the
case
that
all
treasury
regulations
are
interpretive
regulations.
one
of
them,
which
is
cited
in
appellee's
brief
at
page
19,
section...
under
section
1502
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
specifically
provides
authority
to
the
secretary
to
adopt
legislative
regulations.
and
it's
not
true
that
that's
some
kind
of
esoteric
housekeeping
provision.
it
has
to
do
with
establishing
standards
for
allocating
income
and
expenses
among
affiliated
corporations
when
they
file
a
consolidated
return.
and
those
regulations
and
the
decisions
made
under
them
have
an
extremely
major
impact
on
the
allocation
of
the
tax
burden
among
affiliated
corporations,
how
much
income
tax
they
pay
and
what
kind
of
capital
gains
they're
subject
to.
and
with
respect
to
justice
scalia's
question
about
the
president's
imposing
a
fee
on
imported
oil,
yes,
under
the
trade
expansion
act
in
the
early
1970s,
the
decision
was
made
by
president
ford
to
substitute
for
a
system
of
oil
import
quotas
a
system
of
oil
import
fees.
and
this
court
unanimously
sustained
that
against
a
non-delegation
challenge
in
the
case
of
fea
v.
algonquio
which
is
at
5426
of
the
united
states
reports.
thank
you.
