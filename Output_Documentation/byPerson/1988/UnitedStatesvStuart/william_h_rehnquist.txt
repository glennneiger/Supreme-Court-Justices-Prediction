chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
87-1064,
united
states
versus
philip
george
stuart.
mr.
wallace,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
ninth
circuit
expressly
consider
the
summons
question
in
its
opinion
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
peery,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
peery,
the
subsections,
i
guess,
you're
talking
about,
7602(c)
and
so
forth,
speak
of
the
justice
department
which
surely
refers
to
the
united
states
justice
department,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
but
how
do
you
get
from
section
7602's
reference
to
the
justice
department
to
kind
of
a
renvoi-type
reference
to
canadian
procedure.
we
don't
know
that
the
canadian
justice
department
plays
the
same
role
in
collection
of
canadian
taxes
that
our
justice
department
does.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what,
what
does
that
mean
when,
when
you
come
to
apply?
does
it
mean
that
a,
a
complaint
or
whatever...
indictment,
whatever,
might
be
filed
in
the
philippines
has
been
filed
in
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what,
what
i
meant
to
ask
you
was
you
say
is
there
a
criminal
prosecution.
you
put
that,
it
seems
to
me,
as
if
that's
a
very
definite
type
of
standard.
but,
really,
what
does
it
mean?
does
it
mean
are
authorities
investigating
with
the
possibility
of,
of
filing,
filing
what
would
correspond
to
an
indictment
or
is
there
an
indictment
already
filed?
which
of
those?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what...
in
this
country
it's
one
function
is
in
one
division
and
another
function
is
in
another
division.
but
as
justice
scalia
points
out,
in
a
country
where
they
don't
have
that
separation
of
functions,
the,
the
question
really
would
be
very
difficult
to
answer,
i
would
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
it
the
united
states
is
concerned
as
to
how
canada
goes
about
investigating
tax
delinquencies
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
dichotomy
has
obviously
been
enacted
in
the
tefra
amendments.
but
why
should
it
carry
over
to
our
concern
for
the
relationship
between
a
canadian...
the
canadian
government
and
a
canadian
taxpayer?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
that
that
language
can
be
only
read
in
one
way?
i,
i
think
that
my
point
is
that
if
the
language
isn't
quite
as
clear
as
you
think,
it
doesn't
make
much
policy
sense
to,
to
adopt
your
suggestion
if
the
other
one
is
equally
plausible
under
the
language.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
peery.
mr.
wallace,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you
mr.
wallace.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
87-1064,
united
states
against
stuart
will
be
announced
by
justice
brennan.
