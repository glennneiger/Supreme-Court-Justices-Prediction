mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
proceeding
to
enforce
internal
revenue
summonses
for
bank
records
in
a
bank
in
bellingham,
washington,
that
reflect
accounts
of
two
canadian
nationals.
the
summonses
were
issued
pursuant
to
a
request
by
canada
under
a
tax
treaty
between
canada
and
the
united
states
that
provides,
among
other
things,
for
exchanges
of
information
to
assist
each
other
in
the
administration
of
their
tax
laws.
the
united
states
has
such
treaties
in
force
currently
with
34
countries.
they're
collected
in
footnote
17
on
page
<forty-one>
[=
41]
of
our
brief.
and
these
treaties
play
an
important
role
in
the
internal
revenue
service's
broad
authority
to
investigate
compliance
with
our
internal
revenue
laws
by
providing
the
irs,
through
reciprocal
exchanges
with
foreign
source
information
that
would
not
otherwise
be
available
to
the
irs.
the
two
most
pertinent
articles
of
the
treaty
are
set
forth
at
the
beginning
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief
on,
on
page
1a
of
the
appendix
following
page
48
of
our
brief,
and
the
court
will
note
that
article
xix
provides
that
the
competent
authorities,
the
executive
branch
officials
designated
to
administer
the
treaties,
will
exchange
information
that
is
at
their
disposal
or
that
they
are
in
a
position
to
obtain,
and
information
may
be
exchanged
directly
between
the
competent
authorities
of
the
two
contracting
states.
and
article
xxi
says
that
the
commissioner
may
upon
request
furnish
our
treaty
partner
with
information
that
the
commissioner
is
entitled
to
obtain
under
the
revenue
laws
of
the
united
states.
these
are
fairly
typical,
and
they
obviously
contemplate
in
appropriate
cases,
the
use
of
process
to
obtain
records
that
are
not
already
in
the
possession
of
the
tax
authorities
in
each
state
and,
indeed,
the
legislative
history
of
the
particular
treaty
involved
here,
as
we
set
forth
on
page
29
of
our
brief,
shows
that
during
the
confirmation
process,
and
that's
in
footnote
11
and
the
accompanying
text,
it
was
contemplated
in
the
senate
that
a
process
such
as
an
internal
revenue
summons
would
be
used
to
secure
information
for
each
treaty
partner.
and
the
specific
reference
that
was
made
there
was
to
the
obtaining
of
bank
records.
and
in
1975--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
a--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
a...
certainly
a
possible
reading
of
7602,
and
that
very
question
was
debated
and
decided
in
the
1975
second
circuit
case
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
united
states
against
a.
l.
burbank
company,
in
which
this
court
denied
certiorari.
the
contention
was
made
there
that
the
summons
authority
conferred
by
congress
was
not
sufficiently
broad
to
obtain
information
of,
of...
regarding
compliance
with
the
treaty
partner's
revenue
laws,
notwithstanding
the
broader
perspective
that
i
tried
to
give
the
court
that
this...
looked
at
overall
becomes
a
means
of
getting
reciprocal
information
that
the
irs
could
not
otherwise
get
about
compliance
with
the
american
tax
laws.
and
the
second
circuit
held
in
that
case
that
7602
should
not
be
interpreted
more
narrowly.
not
only
old
this
court
deny
certiorari,
but
congress
since
has
amended
7602
without
disturbing
that
provision,
and
a
large
number
of
these
treaties
have
since
been
entered
into
in
presumed
reliance
on
this
interpretation.
at
the
time
of
the
burbank
decision,
the
second
circuit
stated
that
there
were
19
such
treaties
then
in
effect.
there
are
now
34
such
treaties
in
effect.
so,
the
burbank
decision,
we
submit,
was
not
only
a
correct
interpretation
at
the
time,
but
it
has
built
into
the
fabric
of
the
law
and
as,
in
many
other
instances,
if
possible,
a
statute
should
be
interpreted
in
a
way
that
helps
to
effectuate
the
purposes
of
a
treaty,
which
is
also
the
supreme
law
of
the
land.
and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--we
have
no
language.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i,
i
don't
have
a
phrase
that
looks
specifically
to
investigation
of
compliance
with
canadian
or
other
countries'
revenue
laws,
but
i,
i
do
think
the
broader
perspective
that
i
have
mentioned,
that
these
reciprocal
obligations
are
a
method
by
which
the
internal
revenue
service
is
enabled
more
successfully
to
conduct
its
own
investigations
is
highly
pertinent,
along
with
what
we
submit
is
congressional
acquiescence
in
this
interpretation,
not
only
reflected
in
amendments
of
7602,
but
in
the
confirmation
of
these
numerous
treaties
that
look
toward
the
use
of
compulsory
process.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
necessarily.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
has
information,
although
a
similar
argument
could
be
made
about
the
service's
authority
to
conduct
any
investigation
or
engage
in
any
operations.
it's
all
part
of
chapter
78
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
which
includes
chapter
7602.
and,
of
course,
all
authority
that
the
service
has
to
investigate
is
replete
with
references
to
our
revenue
laws.
so,
i'd
have
to
say
that
a
similar
argument
could
be
made
about
furnishing
any
information
under
the
treaty.
that
a
question
could
be
raised
about
the
service's
statutory
authority.
so,
the
summons
question
is
not
unique
in
that
respect.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
did
not
expressly
discuss
this
question,
but
it
accepted
the
holding
in
the
burbank
case.
its,
its
holding
is
that
a
summons
can
be
used
for
this
purpose
if
the
service
complies
with
the
requirement
that
it
added
with
respect
to
a...
an
analog
to
a
referral
to
the
u.s.
department
of
justice.
so,
implicit
in
its
holding
is
acceptance
of
the
burbank
decision.
and,
indeed,
one
could
argue
that
in
the
absence
of
a
cross-petition,
that
question
is
not
open
because
it
would
change
the
relief
in
a
manner
more
favorable
to
the
respondents
here,
because
the
ninth
circuit
ordered
a
remand
that
does
not
preclude
enforcement
of
the
summons
if
that
condition
can
be
compiled
with
by
the
revenue
service.
so,
as
a
technical
matter,
the
question
really
is
not
open
before
the
court
in
this
case,
but
we
do
submit
that
the
burbank
decision
is
part
of
the
fabric
of
the
law
now
that
should
not
be
repudiated
by
this
court,
and,
and
it
it
plays
an
important
role
in
our
foreign
relations.
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
do
in
this
case
was
put
itself
in
conflict
with
a
later
1983
second
circuit
decision
called
united
states
against
manufacturers
&
traders
trust
company
by
holding;
that
is,
the
ninth
circuit's
holding,
that
the
supporting
affidavits
in
this
case
did
not
make
a
prima
facie
showing
that
the
summonses
were
issued
for
a
legitimate
purpose
because
they
failed
to
state
that
the
canadian
investigation
had
not
reached
a
stage
analogous
to
referral
to
the
u.s.
justice
department
for
a,
a,
a
grand
jury
investigation
or
for
criminal
prosecution.
and
section
7602(c)
prohibits
the
issuance
of
a
summons
by
the
irs
when
such
a
referral
to
the
u.s.
justice
department
is
in
effect.
now,
in
adding
this
requirement,
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
here
erred
on
two
principal
grounds.
the
first
is
that
the
treaty
clearly
contemplates
that
the
question
whether
the
treaty
partner
has
made
a
proper
request
is
to
be,
be
determined
by
the
executive
branch
official
designated
to
administer
the
treaty,
referred
to
in
the
treaty
as
the
"competent
authority".
as
we
have
explained
in
our
brief,
most
of
the
information
that
is
actually
exchanged
under
these
treaties
is
provided
directly
by
the
competent
authority
without
any
other
entity,
judicial
or
otherwise,
of
the
government
being
involved.
a
typical
example
is
compilations
of
dividend
payments
by
various
american
corporations
to
foreign
nationals
and
reciprocal
information
from
the
foreign
country.
in
many
instances,
the
rate
of
withholding
is
lower
for
dividend
payments
to
foreign
nationals
than
it
would
be
under
the
internal
revenue
law
for
a
dividend
payment
to
an
american.
and
the
corporations
will
provide
the
irs
with
a
list
of
the
foreign
nationals
for
whom
the
lower
withholding
rate
provided
for
by
treaty
has
been
utilized,
and
the
irs
without
any
particular
request,
even,
from
our
treaty
partner
will
provide
compilations
of
that
information
to
the
treaty
partner.
much
of
the
information
that
is
exchanged
is
exchanged
without
any
particular
request
and
without
any
use
of
process.
now,
in
those
instances
where
a
summons
is
used
to
secure
information
not
already
in
the
hands
of
the
irs,
the
summons
enforcement
proceeding,
we
submit,
which
is
summary
in
nature
this
court
has
emphasized
many
times,
should
not
inject
the
courts
into
this
aspect
of
treaty
administration
in
making
or
second-guessing
the
determination
ordinarily
made
by
the
competent
authority
and
by
the
executive
branch
about
whether
the
request
by
the
treaty
partner
is
a
proper
request
under
the
treaty.
this
is
the
kind
of
question
that
involves
sensitive
foreign
policy
considerations.
there
quite
obviously
would
be
sensitivity
to
having
a
court
inquiry
focusing
on
the
good
faith
of
the
treaty
partner
in
making
a
request
for
information
under
the
treaty
in
which
the
courts
would
be
reexamining
and
perhaps
second-guessing
the
determination
made
by
the
executive
branch
official
charged
with
that.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it,
it,
it,
it...
this
court
starting
with
united
states
against
powell
has
characterized
the
inquiry
to
be
made
in
the
summons
enforcement
proceedings
as
an
inquiry
into
the
irs'
good
faith
in
issuing
the
summons,
and
good
faith
is
largely
translated
into
whether
it's
for
a
legitimate
statutory
purpose,
whether
the
proper
procedures
have
been
followed,
whether
the
information
may
be
relevant
as
the
court
said
to
compliance
with
the
internal
revenue
laws,
whether
there
is
a
collateral
purpose,
such
as
harassing
the
taxpayer
or
trying
to
put
pressure
on
the
taxpayer
to
settle
a
collateral
dispute.
those
are
elements
of
good
faith
which
arguably
could
arise
in,
in
inquiring
into
the
legitimacy
of
the
treaty
partner's
request.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
would
question
the
legitimacy
of
their
normal
investigative
process.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
the
treaty
or
statute
had
specified
that...
you
know,
i
can't
argue
that
that
would
be
an
open-ended
invitation
for
the
courts
to
examine
good
faith.
but
what
this
court's
line
of
decisions
has
indicated
is
that
it
is
the
good
faith
of
the
irs
in
asking
that
a
summons
be
enforced
that
is
the
proper
subject
of
investigation
in
a
summons
enforcement
proceeding,
not
the
merits
of
the
investigation.
the
powell
decision,
which
is
the
seminal
decision
in
379
u.s.
made
that
very
clear
with
respect
to
two
issues
that
the
taxpayer
sought
to
have
reexamined
that
went
to
the
merits
of
the
investigation,
two
rather
discrete
issues.
one,
because
the
statute
of
limitations
had
expired
except
for
fraud,
whether
there
was
a
sufficient
basis
to
conduct
the
investigation
because
there
was
a
sufficient
basis
to
suspect
fraud,
and
the
other
was
whether
the
commissioner
had
properly
certified
that
a,
a,
a...
an
additional
inspection
of
records
was
necessary
which
had
to
be
certified
under
the
statute
when
there
had
already
been
one
inspection
of
records.
and
the
court
held
that
neither
of
those
aspects
of
the
merits
of
the
investigation
is
something
to
be
raised
in
the
summons
enforcement
proceeding;
that
instead,
it
has
to
be
limited
to
the
kinds
of
issues
that
i
had
averted
to
a
bit
earlier
and
as
recently
as
the
court's
unanimous
decision
in
the
tiffany
fine
arts
case
in
volume
469
u.s.,
the
court
again
reemphasized
when
the
taxpayer
complained
that
the
irs
was
unnecessarily
investigating
too
many
licensees
under
the
scheme
that
was
at
issue
there,
and
i
may
quote
the
court,
"the
decision
of
how
many
and
which
licensees
to
contact
is
one
for
the
the
irs,
not
tiffany
to
make.
"
and
one
might
add,
not
the
court
in
the
course
of
a
summons
enforcement
proceeding.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
it
would.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
with
respect
to
the
summons
enforcement
proceeding,
what
could
be
shown
is
that
the
irs
was
not
acting
in
good
faith
because
the
irs
did
not
consider
this
a
proper
request
under
the
treaty,
but
was
lending
itself
to
a
scheme
of
harassment
concerning
information
that
has
no
possible
relevance
to
tax
information.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i,
i,
i,
i
would
not
want
to
mislead
the
court
into
thinking
that
the
irs
rubber-stamps
every
treaty
request
for
information,
even
information
that
is
on
hand.
but
under
the
treaty,
it's
the
competent
authority
at
the
irs
who
makes
the
determination
of
whether
that
is
a
proper
request.
but--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--if
i,
if
i
may
say
so,
mr.
justice,
what
makes
it
seem
less
extraordinary
to
us,
is
that
the
summons
enforcement
proceeding,
the,
the
attempt
to
interfere
with
the
investigation
is
not
the
ordinary
place
in
which
the
merits
of
summonses
for
third-party
records
is
debated.
it's
usually
debated
not
in
that
summary
context,
but
later
on
when
there's
an
effort
to
use
the
information
against
an
individual.
and
here
if
there
is
something
that
does
not
comply
with
the
rights
of
canadian
taxpayers,
the
defense
would
ordinarily
be
raised
in
the
canadian
courts.
that's
where
canadian
law
would
ordinarily
be
debated.
in,
in,
in
donaldson
against
the
united
states
in
volume
400,
the
court
held
that
the
taxpayer
did
not
even
have
standing
to
intervene
in
a
summons
enforcement
proceeding
in
which
the
irs
was
trying
to
get
third-party
records
relating
to
the
taxpayer's
liability,
in
that
case
records
of
his
former
employer.
it
is
sometimes
mistakenly
thought
that
congress
overruled
the
donaldson
case.
congress
has
left
that
holding
in
donaldson
entirely
untouched
for
the
category
of
third-party
records
that
was
involved
there,
employer
records
or
records
of
a
former
employer.
there
is...
that
is
still
good
law.
the
taxpayer
cannot
even
be
heard
during
the
summons
enforcement
proceeding.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
you
can...
in
the
summons
enforcement
proceeding,
the
question
is
the
irs'
good
faith
rather
than
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it,
it
does
consider
whether
the
request
is
a
proper
one
under
the
treaty,
that
is
correct.
but
in
most
instances--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
would...
that
would
depend
on
whether
there
is
also
a
legitimate
basis
for
the
request
that
complies
with
the
terms
of
the
treaty.
not
every
country
with
which
we
have
a
treaty
has
our
system
of
government.
you'll
notice
that
among
the
34
countries,
there
are
several
communist
states,
and
the
political
branches
of
our
government
have
determined
they
will
exchange
information.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
the
enforcement
court
should
examine
those
motives.
in
determining
whether
to
honor
a
request
under
a
treaty,
we're
dealing
with
a
sensitive
area
of
foreign
relations
that
is
ordinarily
a,
a
matter
for
the
executive
branch,
and
those
conducting
our
foreign
relations
and
not
a
matter
to
be
debated
courtroom
by
courtroom.
and
in
most
instances,
this
determination
whether
to
furnish
the
information
or
not
is
dispositively
made
by
the
executive
branch
officials.
there
is
no
mechanism
whereby
the
courts
could
ordinarily
interfere
with
the
furnishing
of
that
information,
regardless
of
whether
some
people
might
think
that
the
particular
government
might
be
harassing
particular
people,--
that
has
been
something
taken
into
account
in
negotiating
and
determining
to
comply
with
these
treaties.
i
just
want
to
advert
very
briefly
to
our
second
major
point,
which
is
that
neither
the
treaty
nor
the
statute
contains
the
substantive
restriction
that
the
court
of
appeals
here
added,
this
search
for
an
analog
to
reference
to
the
united
states
justice
department,
and
we
submit
that
it
is
a
wholly
inappropriate
addition
because
that
search
reflects
considerations
entirely
of
domestic
law
that
do
not
fit
very
well,
if
at
all,
to
any
of
the
foreign
systems
of
law
enforcement
that
we're
involved
with
here.
and
a
little...
in
a
way,
this
is
a
little
like
arguing
to
the
court
that
the
sun
does
not
revolve
around
the
earth.
foreign
systems
are
quite
different,
and
what
was
reflected
in
the
series
of
cases
in
which
this
was
developed
was
an
effort
by
the
court
and
then
by
congress
to
reconcile
the
irs's
broad
investigative
authority
with
the
normal
rules
governing
criminal
discovery
and
grand
jury
subpoenas
so
as
to
not
have
a
different
rule
in
criminal
cases
applying
for
criminal
tax
cases
and
the
normal
rule
applying
for
other
prosecutions.
i
would
like--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i,
i,
i
could
not
say,
mr.
justice.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
if
i
may.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
i
may
refer
the
court
to
the
pertinent
statutes
at
the
end
of
our
brief,
pages
2a
and
3a,
first
of
all,
section
7602(b)
at
the
bottom
of
2a
says
that
a
permissible
purpose
for
the
issuance
of
a
summons
is
to
get
information
about
a
criminal
offense.
that
is
not
the
limitation
that
congress
has
placed.
the
limitation
is
in
subsection
(c)
about
justice
department
referrals
being
in
effect,
and
the
line
drawn
there
is
not
a
line
about
whether
a
prosecution
is
pending.
it
is
the
question
whether
treasury
has
recommended
to
justice
that
it
undertake
a
grand
jury
investigation
or
a
prosecution
or
whether
justice
has
requested
information
from
treasury
regardless
of
whether
a
prosecution
is
actually
pending.
and
the
reason
for
this
limitation
on
the
summons
enforcement
authority
was
explained
by
the
senate
report
in
language
set
forth
on
page
17
of
our
brief.
it
was
so
as
to
not
to
broaden
the
justice
department's
right
of
criminal
discovery
or
to
infringe
on
the
role
of
the
grand
jury.
it
was
a
reason
that
had
to
do
with
the
division
of
functions
between
domestic
institutions
in
this
country
and
reflected
the
language
of
this
court's
lasalle
decision.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
(b)
says
you
can
use
it
for
the
purpose
of
inquiring
into
a
criminal
offense,
mr.
justice.
congress
specifically
authorized
the
use
of
an
irs
summons
for
that
purpose
and
put
an
end
to
inquiry
about
whether
the
<irs>
[=
irs]
had--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--had
the
purpose
of
inquiring
into
a
criminal
defense,
and
instead
drew
the
bright
line
about
whether
a
referral
is
in
effect.
