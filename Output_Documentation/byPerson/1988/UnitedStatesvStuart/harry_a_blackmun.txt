mr.
peery,
does
the
record
show
why
these
canadian
citizens
have
the
american
bank
accounts?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
there
is--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--they're
your
clients,
aren't
they?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
you
have
no
idea?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
they
might
have
been
doing
business
in
this
country
at
one
time,
set
up
an
account,
and
just
kept
it.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
nothing
like
that
in
the

justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
you
don't
know?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
peery,
do
you
know
what
the...
what
would
happen
if
the
situation
were
reversed
and
our
government
was
asking
revenue
canada
to
investigate
american
accounts
up
in
british
columbia?
would
they
look
at
this
dichotomy
prevalent
in
the
united
states
between
a
civil
investigation
and
a
criminal
one,
a
criminal
referral?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
they
look
at
their
own?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
does
it
parallel
ours
entirely?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
it
true
in
pakistan
or
the
philippines?
