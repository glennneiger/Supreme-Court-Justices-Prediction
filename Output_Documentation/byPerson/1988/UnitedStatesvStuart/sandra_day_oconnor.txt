mr.
peery,
i
guess
you
are
not
arguing
to
us
here
that
under
this
treaty
that
the
only
information
sought
can
be
information
relevant
to
an
inquiry
concerning
an
internal
revenue
tax
of
the
united
states?
you're
not
making
that
argument?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
are
not
making
that
argument
to
us?
that's
not--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
the
court
below
did
not,
of
course,
rest
its
holding
on
that
matter?
