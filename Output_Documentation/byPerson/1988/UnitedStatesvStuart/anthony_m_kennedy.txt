if
you
did
not
have
the
summons
authority,
the
treaty
wouldn't
necessarily
be
a
nullity,
would
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
the
government
still
has
information
that
it
can
furnish.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i'm
somewhat
puzzled,
however,
because
in
your
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question,
you
said
well,
the
irs
does
make...
give
itself
some
assurance
that
the
other
country
is
acting
in
good
faith,
yet
i
thought
that's
exactly
what
you're
telling
us
we
can't
require
you
to
do.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
understand
that
that's
your
position.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
question
was
put
to
you
suppose
a
country
is
harassing
someone,
say,
for
his
political
views,
and
the
irs
is
in
good
faith.
it
knows
that
the
country
wants
the
material,
but
you
say
the
irs
does
make
some
investigation
on
the
merits
of
the
request?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
it
a
proper
request
under
the
treaty
if
the
country
is
harassing
someone
for
their
political
views?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
still
not
clear
to
me
when
you
examine
into
the
motives
of
another
country
and
when
you
don't.
and
if
you
indicate
that
you
do,
i
thought
that's
exactly
what
you're...
what
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
you
should
do
and
that
you're
arguing
against.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what,
what
would
the
canadians
or
the
philippine
government...
say,
the
philippine
government
do
if
they
have
a
single
unit
that
investigates
both
civil
and
criminal
matters
and
they
are
simply
studying
the
file?
is
that
a
pending
prosecution?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it's...
but
it's
your
test,
and
if
you
can't
even
explain
to
us
how
the
government
should
answer
under
its
test,
then
it's
not
a
very
strong
test.
