mr.
charles
e.
peery
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
here,
respondents
submit,
is
whether
domestic
law
limits
upon
irs
summons
authority
are
expanded
by
the
treaty
with
canada,
which
is
the
subject
of
these
cases.
should
the
irs
be
required
to
comply
with
domestic
revenue
laws
of
the
united
states
when
it
asks
the
courts
to
lend
their
process
and
their
authority
to
enforce
an
irs
summons
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
information
for
a
foreign
government?
under
a
specific
treaty
which
incorporates
and...
by
reference...
and
defers
to
the
revenue
laws
of
the
united
states
of
america,
respondents
submit
that
the
answer
properly
is
the
one
given
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
these
consolidated
cases
below.
mr.
charles
e.
peery
yes.
there
are
cross-references
in
articles
xix
and
xxi
to
the
departments
of
the
two
governments.
revenue
canada
is
referred
to
specifically,
and
the
commissioner
of
the
internal
revenue
in
the
united
states
is,
is
referred
to
specifically.
but,
both
of
them...
both
of
those
sections,
xix
and
xxi
of
the
treaty,
refer
to
the
domestic
laws,
revenue
laws
of
each
of
the
countries,
and
that's
what
gets
us
to
section
7602.
mr.
charles
e.
peery
actually,
in
these
cases
i
believe
we
do
now
know
something
about
the
method
and
approach
of
the
canadian
tax
authority
and
their
interrelationship
with
the
canadian
department
of
justice,
and
it
is
very
much
like
the
system
in
the
united
states,
so
that
the
burdensome
inquiry
that
the
government
has
raised
i
submit
really
does
not
apply
to
this
case.
in
the,
the
supplemental
brief
that
we
filed,
we
refer
to
an,
an
international
tax
article
which
appeared
just
last
month
which
quotes
from
a
section
of
the
operations
manual
of
revenue
canada
instructing
its
agents
specifically
how
to
act
with
respect
to
requests
for
information
from
the
irs
in
the
united
states.
and
in
that
instruction
it
specifically
says
that
the
summons
authority
of
the
irs
in
the
united
states
may
not
be
used
after
a
referral
to
the
department
of
justice
for
prosecution,
and
further
instructs
its
revenue
agents
that
if
they
want
information
from
the
united
states,
they
must
ask
for
it
under
summons
prior
to
their
own
referral
to
their
own
justice
department.
mr.
charles
e.
peery
no,
sir,
i
was
just
saying--
mr.
charles
e.
peery
--it
ought
to
be
governed
by
the
totality
of
the
revenue
laws
of
the
united
states,
which
is
what
the
treaty
requires
and
which
incorporates,
certainly,
7602
and
its
procedures
and
the
other
treaties.
mr.
charles
e.
peery
well,
your
honor,
we
have
a
specific
factual
situation
in
this
case,
and
i,
i
intend
to
address
the
broader
rule
that
this
court
is
certainly
interested
in.
but
we
have
a
specific
treaty
with
canada.
mr.
charles
e.
peery
i
don't
know
that.
mr.
charles
e.
peery
probably
a
communist
country
as
counsel--
mr.
charles
e.
peery
--we
point
to
the
treaty
with
that
country
which
refers
specifically
to
the
domestic
tax
revenue
law
of
the
united
states,
and
we
tell
that
country
or
have
the
irs
to
tell
that
country
that
when
you
make
a
request
of
the
irs
for
information
which
may
require
our
summons
power,
then
tell
us,
certify
to
us
that
you
do
not
presently
have
a
criminal
prosecution
matter
pending
in
this
instance
for
which
you,
you
are
asking
for
this
information.
i
think
we
can
reduce
it
to,
if
we
need
to,
to
one
question.
the
ninth
circuit
below
posed
two
questions
because
they
were
dealing
with
a
specific
treaty
and
a
specific
country,
canada,
and
the
government
had
said
and
admitted
before
the
ninth
circuit
below
that
it
had
that
information
and
could
have
supplied
and
would
have--
mr.
charles
e.
peery
--perhaps
i
misspoke,
your
honor.
i
believe
i
said
criminal
prosecution.
i
make
that
distinction
as
a
very
important
one.
the
functions
of
criminal
investigation
and
civil
investigation
are
mixed
in
our
system,
and
they
are
abroad.
they
certainly
are
in
canada.
but
the,
the
distinction
really
should
be
between
investigation
and
prosecutorial
function,
and
the
test,
the
question
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
posed,
the
two
questions
which
i've
reduced
perhaps
to
one,
is
certification
of
whether
or
not
there's
a
pending
criminal
prosecution
matter.
mr.
charles
e.
peery
well,
i'm
not
asking
the
court
system
or
the
irs
to
investigate,
although
they
say
that
they
do
look
into
the
motivations
of
the
requesting
country.
perhaps
that's
a
question
for
another
case.
mr.
charles
e.
peery
well,
we...
we
not
only
have
problems
of
differences
in
countries'
approach
to
these
matters,
but
differences
in
language,
and
what...
i
think
that
a
treaty
partner
asking
us
for
information
in
this
country
ought
to
educate
themselves
about
the
difference
between
prosecution
and
investigation
and
should
be
able
to
comply
with
that
request.
mr.
charles
e.
peery
well,
i
believe
it
is.
there
are
difficulties
in
administering
treaties,
but
the
focus
here,
as
these
cases
arise
procedurally
and
come
before
this
court
is
that
the
courts
of
this
country,
the
federal
district
court
in
this
case
is
being
asked
to
lend
its
process
and
its
authority
to
the
enforcement
of
a
summons
to
get
information
from
another
country
under
a
treaty
which
specifically
refers
to
the
domestic
revenue
laws
of
the
united
states.
and
i
think
the
answer
is
that
we
tell
our
treaty
partners
that
these
are
the
requirements
under
the
domestic
revenue
laws
of
the
united
states;
that
there
not
be
a
pending
criminal
prosecution
matter
for
which
this
information
is
requested.
and
they
should
comply.
we
must
do
the
same
with
respect
to
asking
for
information
from
canada.
the
briefing
indicates
that
we,
we
defer
to
canada's
interpretation
of
their
own
procedural
requirements
and
comply
with
it
when
we...
when
the
irs
asks
for
information
from
revenue
canada.
mr.
charles
e.
peery
it
doesn't
sound
like
it
to
me.
but,
again,
i
would
require
the
treaty
partner
to
comply--
mr.
charles
e.
peery
--well,
it
is
because
the
entire
body
of
united
states
law
makes
a
very
important
distinction
between
civil
and
criminal,
criminal
matters.
there
are
protections
available
to
the
individuals
in
our
country
in
criminal
matters
that
don't
exist
in
civil.
it's
an
important
concept
in,
in
the
law
of
the
united
states,
and
the
law
of
the
united
states
is
incorporated
into
the
treaty.
i
think
we
have
a
right
because
the
language
is
there
in
the
treaty
to
require
the
treaty
partner
to
understand
enough
about
our
system
to
be
able
to
use
that
distinction
in
its
request
for
information.
i
admit,
it's
not
an
easy
test.
but
i
think
the
way
to
do
it
is
to
refer
to
the
domestic
revenue
law
of
the
united
states,
as
the
treaty
does.
mr.
charles
e.
peery
well,
i
think
there
was,
was
support
at
the
time
the
burbank
case
was,
was
argued
for
the
position
that
absent
a
specific
authorization
to
the
irs
to
acquire
information
for
a
foreign
government,
none
exists.
i
think
that
restriction
was
made--
mr.
charles
e.
peery
--i'm
not.
i'm
not,
because
of...
my
understanding
was
that
a
certiorari
was
denied
in
the
burbank
case,
and
we've
not
raised
that
specific
argument,
although
i
believe,
i
believe
there's
merit
to
it.
mr.
charles
e.
peery
no.
it
assumed,
as
mr.
wallace
has
pointed
out,
that
under
the
burbank
case
and
others
that
the
summons
authority
of
the
irs
could
be
used
to
meet
its
obligations
under
the...
under
the
treaty.
mr.
charles
e.
peery
that's
true,
your
honor.
again,
i,
i
feel
there
are
substantial
arguments
in
support
of
the
proposition
that
absent
a
specific
authority
to
use
the
summons
for
this
purpose,
none
exists.
but
certainly
where...
that
gets
us
into
the
interpretation
of
treaties
to
effectuate
their
purpose.
mr.
charles
e.
peery
well,
the
question
was
asked
earlier
by
the
court
of
mr.
wallace,
would
the
treaty
be
a
nullity
without
the
summons
authority
of
the
irs,
and
i
believe
mr.
wallace
answered
no.
so,
the
issue
is,
is
raised
in,
in
questioning
by
the
court.
respondents
submit
that
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
below
in
these
consolidated
cases
is
supported
by
the
language
of
the
treaty
contract,
the
actual
practice
of
the
treaty
partners
and
the
language
and
purposes
of
the
subsequent
tax
treaties
between
the
united
states
and
canada;
that
is,
the
1980
treaty
and
the
1985
treaty
specifically
for
the
purpose
of
aid
in
criminal
tax
matters.
all
of
them
require
the
application
of
the
domestic
united
states
revenue
laws.
secondly,
a
legitimate
purpose
showing
is
required
under
united
states
revenue
laws
and,
thirdly,
use
of
an
irs
summons
for
the
specific
purpose
of
criminal
prosecution
is
specifically
rejected
by
the
courts
in,
in
the
cases
and
by
congress
in
the
tefra
amendments,
making
that,
that
use
not
a
legitimate
purpose.
the
fourth
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
the
irs
has
admitted
that
it
is
its
customary
practice
in
domestic
cases
in
applying
to
the
courts
for
enforcement
of
their
summons
to
state
that
there
has
been
no
referral
for
criminal
prosecution.
so,
it's
a
matter
of
customary
practice
in
domestic
cases
and,
again,
the
treaty
refers
to
the
domestic
law
and
practice
in
the
united
states.
fifth,
i
submit
that,
that
the
results
of
the
ninth
circuit's
holding
is
fair
with
respect
to
the
balancing
of
the
interests
between
the
individuals
and
the
irs,
it's
practical
in
application,
it's
efficient
and
it
promotes
uniformity
between
domestic
practice
and
the
tax
treaty
case
information
requirements.
i
submit
that
the--
mr.
charles
e.
peery
--no,
sir,
not
at...
at
this
stage,
although
this
court
in
lasalle
certainly
for
domestic
purposes
has
left
open
the
area
of
institutional
good
faith.
again,
domestic
cases
and
i'm
not--
mr.
charles
e.
peery
--some
other
kind
of
bad
faith.
mr.
charles
e.
peery
yes,
and
it
should,
and
that's
a
proper
area
of
inquiry.
mr.
charles
e.
peery
well,
i,
i
believe
that--
mr.
charles
e.
peery
--sure.
and
i
believe
that's
true.
it
should.
mr.
charles
e.
peery
i
think
it's
a
proper
area
of
inquiry
if
there's,
there's
a
showing
which
fairly
raises
the
issue
of,
of
bad
faith.
mr.
charles
e.
peery
i'm
saying--
mr.
charles
e.
peery
--because
i
think
there's
a
difference.
the
clearly
prohibited
purpose
of
using
irs
summons
for...
in
support
of
criminal
prosecution
is
a
different
matter.
i
mean,
it
has
been
discussed
by
congress,
it's
been
discussed
by
this
court
and
other
courts
repeatedly,
and
everybody
agrees.
it's
unanimous,
that
use
of
the
irs
summons
for
criminal
prosecution
purposes
is
prohibited.
mr.
charles
e.
peery
that's
right.
we
have
no
information,
and
the
ninth
circuit,
i
think,
pointed
out
the
real
problem.
it's
a
dilemma.
it's
a
catch-22
for
the
taxpayer
at
that
point
because
there's
no
discovery
available
to
get
the
kinds
of
information
which
would
be
necessary
to
meet
that
burden
of
proof
on
the
taxpayer,
whereas
the
irs
said
below
that
it
had
that
information.
it
was
given
an
opportunity
to
amend
its,
its
summons,
its
affidavit
in
support
of
summons
application,
and,
and
it
chose
not
to
do
that.
this
case
would
have
been
long
over
had
the
irs
gone
back,
amended
its
affidavit
to
show
the
answer
to
those
two,
two
questions
that
the
ninth
circuit
posed.
has
it
been
referred
in
canada
to
the
department
of
justice
in
canada
or
is
revenue
canada
asking
for
this
information
on
behalf
of
the
department
of
justice,
the
criminal
prosecution
arm?
mr.
charles
e.
peery
no,
sir,
and
i
have
no
idea.
i
was
not
involved
at
that
point.
mr.
charles
e.
peery
and
there's
no
record.
there
is
no
record
to
show
why.
but,
of
course,
american--
mr.
charles
e.
peery
--yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
peery
no.
of
course,
there
is
no
prohibition
against
americans
having
bank
accounts
in
canada,
either.
it
happens
frequently
and,
of
course,
there's
a
great
deal
of
commerce
between
the
two
countries.
corporations
have
accounts
in,
in
both
countries.
mr.
charles
e.
peery
that's
what
i
would
assume.
mr.
charles
e.
peery
no,
but
there's
a
lot
of
commerce
between
washington
state
and
british
columbia,
which
is
where
this,
this
factual
situation
arises,
and
i
would
assume
that
these
were
commercial
matters
at
one
time
and
may
still
be.
mr.
charles
e.
peery
i
do
not
know
that,
sir.
i
submit
that
the
ninth
circuit's
rating
of
the
language
of
the
specific
tax
treaty,
1942
treaty,
which
it
found
applies
here,
is
the
correct
one;
that
article
xix
refers
specifically
to
the
revenue
laws
of
the
two
contracting
states,
the
united
states
and
canada.
it
does
not
refer
to
the
criminal
tax
laws
or
the
criminal
case
law
of
either
country.
it's
specifically
aimed
at
the
revenue
laws
of
the
two
nations.
article
xxi
specifically
describes
the
procedures
for
requests
by
the
canadian
minister
of
the
department
of
natural...
national
revenue
and
specifically
talks
about
the
kind
of
information
which
may
be
furnished
by
the
commissioner
of
the
internal
revenue
service
of
the
united
states
in
the
following
language:
"such
information
as
the
commissioner
is
entitled
to
obtain
under
the
revenue
laws
of
the
united
states
of
america.
"
i
submit
that
that
language
could
not
be
plainer;
that
the
intent
when
department
of
revenue
or
revenue
canada
asks
the
irs
for
information
is
controlled
by
what
is
available
to
the
irs
commissioner
under
the
revenue
laws
of
the
united
states
of
america.
they
include
section
7602,
which
was
the
basis
for
the
irs
petition
below
for
summons
enforcement
in
these
consolidated
cases.
and
7602
sub
(c)
prohibits
issuance
of
a
summons
and
the
beginning
of
any
action
to
enforce
any
summons
if
a
justice
department
referral
is
underway.
this
is
a
codification
by
congress
in
the
tefra
amendments
in
1982
of
that
bright
line
test
that
the
minority
suggested
in
the
lasalle
national
bank
case
from
this
court
in
1978.
it
was
intended,
i
submit,
to
distinguish
between
the
civil
revenue
purposes
which
are
proper
areas
for
investigation
by
the
irs,
a
legitimate
purpose,
and
criminal
prosecution,
which
is
not
a
legitimate
purpose.
mr.
charles
e.
peery
well,
i,
i
think
it
need
not
be
concerned
at
this
point,
certainly,
in
these
cases.
it
only
is
appropriate
to
apply
the
domestic
revenue
laws
of
the
united
states
when
the
treaty
partner,
canada,
asks
for
information.
and
it's
been
very
important
in
the
development
of
the
case
law
and
the,
and
the
code
by
congress
for
guidance
of
the
internal
revenue
service
that
there
be
a
clear
dichotomy
in
the
revenue
service's
activities
between
criminal
prosecution,
which
is
not
authorized,
and
civil
investigation.
mr.
charles
e.
peery
i'm
not
urging
that
we
be
concerned
except
insofar
as
canada
might
be
harassing
a,
a
united
states
citizen
with
respect
to
the
use
of
its
revenue
department
in
asking
the
irs
to
lend
its
weight
to
that.
i'm
not...
that
is
not
the
focus
of
the
respondents'
argument
and
point
here.
the
focus
is
that
the
domestic
revenue
laws
of
the
united
states
apply,
and
if
a
treaty
partner
asks
for
something
within
the
united
states
and
the
irs
to
get
it
with
its
summons
authority,
it
has
to
comply
with
domestic
united
states
revenue
law.
mr.
charles
e.
peery
well,
i
think
we
certainly
ought
to
be
reluctant
to
make
an
inquiry
into
the
domestic
affairs
of
a,
of
a
foreign
government,
a
treaty
partner.
i
agree
with
mr.
wallace
about
that.
but,
i'm
saying
that
the
test
and
approach
applied
by
the,
by
the
ninth
circuit
does
not
require
that,
and
that's
not
this
case.
the
revenue
service
admitted
below
that
it
had
information
from
revenue
canada
that
they
had
not
referred
the
matter
to
the
department
of
justice
in
canada
and
that
they
were
not
asking
for
the
information
on
behalf
of
the
department
of
justice.
so,
it
would
not,
in
these
cases,
have
required
any
kind
of
investigation
into
the
internal
workings
of
revenue
canada
or
its
department
of
justice.
i
submit
that
the
1980
treaty,
which
was
ratified
somewhat
after
the
lasalle
case,
actually
served
to
apply
the
judicial
gloss...
that
is,
the
entire
body
of
the
revenue
laws
of
the
united
states,
and
referred
to
it
quite
specifically.
the
government
concedes
in
its
brief
on
page
4,
footnote
3,
that
the
language
and
purpose
of
the
1980
treaty
are
essentially
identical
to
the
language
and
purpose
of
the
1942
treaty,
and
its
purpose
is
to
obtain
information
for
each
of
the
parties
in
the
same
way
as
if
its
own
taxation
were
involved.
so,
there's
another
referral
specifically
in
the
1980
treaty
to
the
domestic
revenue
law
of
the
country
who
is
being
requested
to
provide
the
information.
subsection
3
of
article
xxvii
provides
with
respect
to
the,
the
process
that...
of
construction
of
that
treaty
that
the
preceding
paragraphs
are
to
be
construed
so
as
to
impose
an
obligation...
they're
not
to
be
construed,
i'm
sorry,
so
as
to
impose
an
obligation
to
supply
information
not
obtainable
under
the
laws
or
in
the
normal
course
of
administration
of
either
of
the
contracting
states.
mr.
charles
e.
peery
surely.
mr.
charles
e.
peery
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
peery
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
peery
it
is
possible,
but
there
was
no
domestic
revenue
purpose
indicated.
mr.
charles
e.
peery
certainly.
mr.
charles
e.
peery
cerainly,
and
it
can
even
be
a
mixed
purpose.
mr.
charles
e.
peery
well,
it's
not,
because
of
the
court's
concerns
and
the
congress'
concerns
about
that
important
dichotomy
between
civil
and
criminal.
mr.
charles
e.
peery
that's
true.
and
if
that
had
been
the
basis
for
the
inquiry,
looking
at--
mr.
charles
e.
peery
--yes,
it
could.
mr.
charles
e.
peery
the
problem
arose
because
the
information
was
furnished
indicated
clearly
that
the
authority
for
the
inquiry
that
the
irs
was
using
was
the
tax
treaty
with
canada
and
section
7602,
and
there
was
an
indication
that
revenue...
that
canada
was
investigating
for
criminal
purposes
creating,
certainly,
an
ambiguity
that
needed
to
be
explored.
and
we,
we
only
asked
for
the
information
that
the
ninth
circuit
required
the
irs
to
provide
on
remand.
i
submit
that
another
reason
for
the
interpretation...
in
support
of
the
approach
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
that...
and
against
the
manufacturers
trust
holding
by
the
second
circuit...
is
that,
that
there's
no
justification
in
the
body
of
the
law
or
the
treaty
or
in
reason
to
create
a
separate
set
of
entitlements
for,
for
the
irs
commissioner
to
use...
a
legal
fiction,
i
submit,
in
order
to
get
information
from
a...
for
a
foreign
country
in
the
united
states
in
a
manner
which
exceeds
the
authority
for
domestic
purposes.
in
our
supplemental
brief
we've
referred
to
the
1985
treaty
on
mutual
legal
assistance
in
criminal
matters,
and
i
submit
that
that
evidences
the
acknowledgment
by
the
treaty
partners,
canada
and
the
united
states,
of
the
important
distinction
between
criminal
prosecution
matters
and
civil
tax
revenue
matters,
and
that
treaty
is
now
before
the
united
states
senate
for,
for
ratification.
it
sets
up
a
separate
system
and
approach
for
the
sharing
of
information
in
those
matters
which
are,
are
criminal
tax
matters,
and
i
submit
quite
appropriately.
it
uses
the
departments
of
justice
to
exchange
information,
and
it
is
within
the
context
and
framework
of
the
criminal
law
protections
that
exist
for
the
citizens
of
this
country.
and
i
think
i
would
urge...
what
we
see
from
that
is
that
the
executive,
at
least
on
one
hand,
agreeing
with
congress
and
with
the
opinions
of
the
courts
is
now
saying
that
if
it's
a
criminal
prosecution
matter,
we
ought
to
call
it
that,
have
a
separate
procedure
for
handling
it
as
a
criminal
prosecution
and
proceed
that
way.
the
ninth
circuit's
approach
and
the
requirement
on
the
irs
to
make
a
prima
facie
showing
of
a
legitimate
purpose
including
the
absence
of
the
prohibited
purpose
of
criminal
prosecution
i
submit
is
fair,
and
it's
to...
in
the
allocation
of
the
responsibilities
and
information
available
to
the
two
parties.
it's
practical
because
it,
it
complies
with
the
practice
of
the
parties,
the
revenue
service
and
revenue
canada.
it's
efficient
because
it
requires
the
information
to
be
supplied
by
the,
the
party
which
has
best
access
to
the
that
information,
and
that's
the
irs,
and
it's
uniform
in
that
it
promotes
an
identity
of
approach
for
the
courts
to
use
when
they're
considering
petitions
for
enforcement
of
irs
summons,
whether
they
arise
in
the
domestic
setting
or
by
means
of
a,
of
a
request
under
a
treaty.
mr.
charles
e.
peery
they
look
at
their
own,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
peery
i
believe
the
government's
brief
has
pointed
that
out.
that
is
the
actual
procedure,
and
certainly
it's,
it's
reflected
in
the,
in
the
recent
law
review
article
that
i--
mr.
charles
e.
peery
--not
entirely,
but
there
is
that
dichotomy
and
distinction
between
prosecution
and
investigation,
and
so
there's
no
problem
in
compliance
in
canada
with,
with
that
distinction.
mr.
charles
e.
peery
i
would
just
have
to
say
they
have
to
understand
enough
about
our
domestic
revenue
laws
which,
which
control
their
rights
to
information
under
the
treaty,
your
honor.
