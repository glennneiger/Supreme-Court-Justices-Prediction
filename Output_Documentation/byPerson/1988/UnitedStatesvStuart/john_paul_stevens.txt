mr.
wallace,
i
don't
know
whether--
--may
i
interrupt
you,
mr.
wallace?
i
don't
really
understand
that
argument
because
if
you
have
an,
an
objective
test,
whether
there's
been
a
reference
to
prosecution
or
not,
why
does
that
involve
any
inquiry
into
good
faith?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
couldn't
you
just
presume
that
there
was
good
faith
in
all
matters
of
that
kind
and
still
say
you've
got
to
follow
the
american
rule
that
there
has
been
no
reference
for
criminal
purposes
yet?
just
have
a
simple
black
letter
rule
to
that
effect.
that
wouldn't
question
the
motives
of
the
foreign
treaty
partner,
would
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
it
would
just
say
that's
our
rule
on
subpoena
enforcement.
we
have
this
rule,
and
it
doesn't.
therefore,
the
treaty
isn't
compiled
with.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
on
your
view
of
the
matter,
do
you
think
it
requires
an
inquiry
into
the
good
faith
of
the
canadian
taxing
authorities?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
we're
talking
about
a
domestic
matter
and
we
were
persuaded
there
was
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
the
irs
even
though
the
matter
had
not
yet
been
referred
for
prosecution--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
would
defeat
the
summons
enforcement,
would
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then,
why
should
it
not
also
defeat
it
in
the
canadian
context?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you're
saying
the
same
law
applies
to
both.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
therefore--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you'd
require...
i
see.
but
if
there
were,
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
the
burden
is
on
the
taxpayer
or
the,
the,
the
person
resisting
the
summons,
why
has
that
burden
been
discharged
in
this
case,
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
why
shouldn't
it
be
on
the
taxpayer's
burden,
or
the,
the
person
raising
the
issue's
burden
to
say
it
is
being
used
for
such
a
purpose
in
canada?
there's
no
showing
either
way,
as
i
understand
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
peery,
can
i
interrupt
you
there
for
just
a
second?
justice
john
paul
stevens
these
banks
that
have
the
information,
the
one
bank
i
guess,
isn't
it,
somewhere
in
washington,
is
an
american
bank.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
canadian
citizens
have
an
account
in
the
american
bank?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
isn't
it
possible
that
those
canadian
citizens
would
have
an
income
tax
obligation
in
the
united
states
by
reason
of
interest
earned
on
that
account
or
something
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
at
least
it
would
be
permissible,
would
it
not,
for
irs
to
say
i'd
like
to
check
the
bank
records
there
to
see
if
these
foreign
citizens
might
owe
some
federal
taxes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
so,
that
information
would
be
obtainable
purely
for
domestic
purposes
pursuant
to
the,
to
the
united
states
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
isn't
that
the
whole
answer
to
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there's
no
criminal...
if
they're
just
looking
at
the
american
purposes,
there
is
not
even
a
suggestion
that
there
has
been
any
american
referral
for...
to
the
department
of
justice.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
hadn't
been
the
basis,
but
it
was...
it
could
be
done
pursuant
to
american
law
is
what
i'm
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
just
that
limited
purpose.
