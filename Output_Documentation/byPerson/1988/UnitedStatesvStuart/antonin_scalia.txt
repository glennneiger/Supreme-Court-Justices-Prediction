justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wallace,
excuse
me.
may,
may
i
interrupt
for
a
moment.
maybe,
maybe
i'm
not
seeing
something
here,
but
the,
the
treaty
says
"information
which
its
competent
authorities
are
in
a
position
to
obtain
under
its
revenue
laws.
"
right,
and,
and
you
rely--
justice
antonin
scalia
--on
section
7602.
but
as
i
read
7602,
it
only
authorizes
summons
for
purposes
of
determining
united
states
tax
liability.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
how
can
you
say
that
you're
in
a
position
to
obtain
it
under
our
revenue
laws
when
you're
not
seeking
to
ascertain
united
states
tax
liability?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
have
any
language
that
would
allow
that,
though,
do
you?
i
mean,
the
language
seems
quite
clear.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
closest
phrase
you
have
that
would
allow
it
to
be
read
this
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wallace,
you're,
you're
really...
you're
suggesting
that
this
statute
would
apply
against
a
united
states
citizen
as
well;
it's
not
just
a
citizen
of
a
foreign
country,
right?
i
mean,
the
treaty
would
cover
the
united
states
citizen
who
was
asserted
to
be
liable
for
foreign
taxes,
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
a
united
states
citizen
who
is
being
harassed
by
a
by
a
foreign
government,
that
foreign
government
can
enlist
our
government
in
that
harassment
without
any
possibility
of
our
courts
stopping
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
taking
a
position
the
irs
doesn't
have
to,
have
to
inquire
into
that.
that's,
that's
part
of
your
whole
point,
that
you
don't
want
our
irs
to
have
to
inquire
into
whether
there
is
harassment
going
on
or
the
good
faith
of
the
foreign
government.
do
you
want
the
irs
to
have
to
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that's
an
extraordinary...
i
think
that's
extraordinary
to
have
the
united
states
courts
engaging
in
that,
and
i
think
it's
a
hard
question.
maybe
if
congress
had
passed
a
statute
covering
this
matter,
it
might
have
given
some
thought
to
that
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
since
it
hasn't,
you're
really
sort
of
asking
us
to
make
it
up.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
our
interpretation
of
our
law
should
be
governed
by
revenue
canada?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
why...
why?
i'd
much
rather
have
it
governed
by
our
justice
department
than
revenue
canada,
if
it
comes
to
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
bring
before
us
one,
one
case
out
of
however
many
treaties
mr.
wallace
said
there
were
in
which
it
may
be
easy
to
analogize
the,
the,
the
revenue
system
of
the
country
in
question
with
that
of
the
united
states,
but
i,
i
doubt
whether,
whether
it's
possible
with
a
lot
of
the
other
countries.
and,
and
certainly
in
determining
whether
the
rule
you're
urging
upon
us
is,
is
a
rule
that
can
possibly
have
been
intended,
it's
relevant
whether
we
know
anything
about
the
internal
revenue
systems
of
these
other
countries.
just
because
you
pick
one
country
that
we
might
doesn't,
doesn't
justify
us
in
adopting
the
rule
you're,
you're
suggesting.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
philippines,
for
example.
do
we
have
a,
a
treaty
with
the
philippines?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
see.
they're
all
listed
in
the
book.
let's
pick
the
most
exotic
country
that's,
that's
listed
in
mr.
wallace's
footnote.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
now,
how
are
we
supposed
to
behalf
with
respect
to
a
referral
requirement
from
such
a
country?
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
but,
but,
you
see,
you,
you
have
two
different
organizations
in
this
country.
one
does
the
irs
investigation
and
the
other
does
the
criminal
investigation.
what
if
you're
dealing
with
a
country
where
there's
just
one
unit
that
does
all
investigations?
if
it,
it,
it
conducts
the
investigation
and
if
it
digs
up
enough
stuff
to
prosecute
criminally,
it
prosecutes
criminally.
it's
meaningless
to
have
this,
this
referral
distinction.
in
such
a
country
you
could
never
say
there's
no
criminal
investigation
pending
because
there's,
there's
no
distinction
between
a
criminal
investigation
and
an
irs
investigation.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're,
you're
not
raising
the
argument...
you're
just,
just
in
case
i
might
disagree
with
burbank,
you're
asking
me
to
imagine
what
kind
of
authority
i
think
the
united
states
would
have
if
the
united
states
had
authority.
that's
what
you
want
me
to
tell
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
if
we
adopted
that,
mr.
wallace,
i
assume
we
would
have
to
adopt
(b)
as
well;
i
mean,
that
is
to
say
we
would
not...
if
we
adopted
your
opponent's
argument,
we
would
have
to
say
you
also
can't
use
the
irs'
power
if
the
foreign
country
is
conducting
a
criminal
investigation,
even
though
there's
no
criminal
prosecution
pending.
you
can't
use
if
for
the
purpose
of
inquiring
into
a
criminal
offense.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
