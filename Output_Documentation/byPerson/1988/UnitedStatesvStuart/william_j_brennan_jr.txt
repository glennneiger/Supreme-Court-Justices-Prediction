justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
articles
19
and
21
of
the
1942
convention
respecting
double
taxation
between
the
united
states
and
canada
require
the
united
states
on
request
and
consistent
with
the
united
states
revenue
laws
to
obtain
and
convey
information
to
canadian
authorities
to
assist
them
in
determining
a
canadian
taxpayer's
income
tax
liability.
the
respondents,
canadian
citizens
and
residents
maintained
accounts
in
the
bank
in
the
united
states.
in
attempting
to
ascertain
their
canadian
income
tax
liability
for
certain
years,
the
canadian
department
of
national
revenue,
pursuant
to
articles
19
and
21
of
the
treaty,
requested
our
internal
revenue
service
to
provide
pertinent
bank
records.
after
the
irs
director
of
foreign
operations
concluded
that
the
request
fell
within
the
1942
convention's
scope
and
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
united
states
to
honor
them,
the
irs
served
in
the
bank
administrative
summonses
for
the
requested
information,
but,
at
respondents'
request,
the
bank
refused
to
comply.
the
respondents
then
petitioned
the
federal
district
court
to
quash
the
summonses
contending
that
because
under
26
usc
7602(c),
the
irs
may
not
issue
a
summons
to
further
its
investigation
of
a
united
states
taxpayer
when
a
justice
department
referral
for
possible
criminal
prosecution
is
in
effect
and
because
revenue
canada's
investigation
of
respondents
was
a
criminal
investigation
in
its
preliminary
stage,
united
states
law
proscribed
the
use
of
a
summons
to
obtain
the
information
for
canadian
authorities
regarding
respondents'
american
bank
accounts.
that
argument
was
rejected,
and
the
district
court
ordered
the
bank
to
comply
with
a
summonses.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
holding
that
before
the
irs
may
honorary
request
for
information
under
the
1942
convention.
it
must
determine
that
revenue
canada's
investigation
has
not
reached
the
stage
analogous
to
a
justice
department
referral
by
the
irs
that
here,
the
affidavit
submitted
by
the
irs
failed
to
state
that
such
a
determination
had
been
made
with
respect
to
revenue
canada's
investigation
of
respondents.
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
that
neither
the
1942
convention
nor
domestic
legislation
requires
the
irs
to
attest
that
the
canadian
tax
investigation
has
not
reached
the
stage
analogous
to
a
justice
department
referral
by
the
irs
in
order
to
obtain
enforcement
of
a
summons
issued
pursuant
to
a
request
by
canadian
authorities
under
the
convention.
