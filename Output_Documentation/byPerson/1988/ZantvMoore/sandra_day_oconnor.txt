ms.
boleyn,
did
either
the
eleventh
circuit
or
the...
or
the
parties
address
the
retroactivity
of
gardner
or
proffitt?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
on
gardner,
mr.
boger,
didn't
the
state
court
determine
that
the
attorney
had
seen
the
report,
the
presentence
report?
justice

i
thought
it
could
be
fairly
read
as
finding
that
the
attorney
had
seen
the
report.
why
didn't
respondent
raise
the
gardner
claim
in
the
first
federal
habeas
petition?
