mr.
john
charles
boger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
two
central
questions
on
this
appeal.
the
first
is
whether
the
federal
courts
have
the
authority
to
modify
standards
that
were
established
by
congress
for
the
evaluation
of
new
constitutional
claims
that
are
presented
for
the
first
time
in
a
second
habeas
corpus
petition.
this
question
has
a
subpart:
may
the
federal
court
substitute
a
standard
that
is
stricter,
less
equitable
and
harsher
to
habeas
defendants?
the
second
central
question
in
this
case
involves
the
decision
of
the
district
court
to
dismiss
mr.
moore's
constitutional
challenge
to
the
state's
use
of
a
presentence
report
at
his
sentencing
hearing.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
challenge...
and
i'll
answer
your
question
now,
justice
stevens...
without
ever
addressing
its
merits,
either
on
the
first
application
or
the
second
one,
finding
it
to
be
an
abuse
of
the
writ.
the
question
here
presented
with
respect
to
that
gardner
claim
is
whether
the
district
court
should
reconsider
its
dismissal
in
the
ends
of
justice
when
the
presentence
report
in
question
was
so
marred
by
false
and
misleading
information
that
it
provoked
the
district
court
to
find...
and
i
quote...
"that
sufficient
likelihood
exists
that
a
wrongful
sentence
was
imposed
on
mr.
moore
based
on
inadequate
information.
"
if
i
may,
i'll
begin
with
the
first
of
these
questions.
our
principal
submission
is
that
the
standards
that
govern
successive
habeas
corpus
petitions
have
been
set
by
congress.
while
fair-minded
persons
undoubtedly
disagree
and
disagree
sharply
on
the
wisest
treatment
of
such
petitions,
congress
itself
during
a
40-year
dialogue
with
the
judicial
conference,
with
attorneys
general,
with
other
interested
parties,
none
of
them
shy,
has
repeatedly
considered
the
diverse
policy
interests
and
has
struck
for
itself
a
clear
balance
that's
reflected
in
2244(b)
and
rule
9(b),
which
embody
its
own
legislative
judgment
about
how
the
competing
interests
should
be
reconciled.
if
federal
courts
are
bound
by
the
congressional
choices
reflected
in
2244
and
rule
9,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
though
not
its
precise
holding,
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
john
charles
boger
well,
the
legislative
history,
your
honor,
i
believe
reflects
a
choice--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--the
statute
itself,
your
honor,
says...
asks
whether
the
defendant
has
deliberately
withheld
or
otherwise
abused
the
writ.
the
legislative
history,
though,
i'm
sure
is
well-known
to
this
court.
this
court,
through
the
rules
enabling
act,
promulgated
rules
for
adoption
by...
approval
by
congress,
including
a
rule
9(b),
that
had
different
language
from
what
finally
appears.
the
language
was
"not
excusable".
congress
held
up
the
enactment
or
the
approval
of
that
set
of
rules.
it
did
so
holding
hearings
the
summer
after
they
were
proposed.
the
hearings
focused
on
four
rules,
one
of
them
rule
9(b).
there
was
concern
expressed
during
those
hearings
as
to
whether
this
proposed
language
of
not
excusable
might
change
the
standards
that
had
formerly
been
followed,
the
standards
reflected
in
sanders.
there's
colloquy
in
the
hearing
that
we
cite
to
the
court
in
our
brief
between
father
drinan
and...
and,
for
example,
who
was
on
the
house
judiciary
committee
and
someone
from
the
judicial
conference
saying--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--no,
your
honor,
it's
not.
it
certainly
helps
to
guide
the
court's
judgment
as
it
looks
through
what
happened.
but
the
question
back
and
forth,
because
it
ultimately
winds
its
way
into
a
report,
was
are
we
doing
anything
more
here
with
this
new
proposed
language
than
incorporating
sanders
v.
united
states?
and
the
answer
is
no.
that's
what's
being
done
with
this
language.
mr.
john
charles
boger
as
a
judicial
holding
perhaps
it
did
not.
when
it
has
been
ratified
by
congress,
first
in
2244(b)
and
then
in
rule
9(b),
yes.
i
think--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--i
don't
believe
that
it
did
leave
things
fluid
on
this
point,
your
honor.
the
rule
in
sanders
reflected
it...
the
judgment
that
what
was
of
concern
were
parties
who
had
deliberately
withheld
new
claims
or
who
had
engaged
in
conduct
that
was
inexcusably
neglectful.
the
court
pointed
to
the
kind
of
conduct
it
meant,
and
the
conduct
reflected,
in
essence,
bad
faith
behavior
by
the
defendant
or
his
attorney.
that's
the
essence
of
the
equitable
underpinnings
of
both
deliberate
withholding
and
inexcusable
neglect.
when
the
congress
in
1966
then
turned
to
2244(b),
it
reflects
in
the
legislative
report
the
kind
of
behavior
it's
worried
about
are
parties
who
bring
identical
petitions
one
after
another,
or
who
withhold
claims,
as
it
put
it,
obviously
well-known
to
them.
that
language,
which
is
in
the
legislative
report,
was
drawn
from
the
judicial
conference
report
to
congress.
that
was
what
judge
orey
phillips
said
had
concerned
the
judicial
conduct...
conference:
petitioners
who
withheld
claims
obviously
well-known
to
them.
that's
a
league...
two
leagues...
away
from
the
kind
of
standard
that
ms.
boleyn
and
the
state
of
georgia
are
proposing
here.
and
what
congress
did
in,
in
1966
it
further
ratified
in
1976
with
rule
9(b).
it
said
in
its
legislative
report
that
modified
the
proposed
rule
9(b)
we
are
afraid
that
this
new
not
excusable
language
might
give
federal
judges
too
great
a
discretion
to
dismiss
claims.
and
then
it
cited
sanders
v.
united
states
in
passing,
once
again
reflecting
congressional
judgment
that
sanders
and
the
standards
reflected
there
were
those
than
congress
had
chosen.
i
think
the
legislative
history,
particularly
as
it
involves
two
separate
actions--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--well,
we
have...
we
have
two
reports.
we
have
i
think
a
senate
report
in
1966.
mr.
john
charles
boger
you
could
have,
your
honor.
there
are
no
dissenting
voices
i
think
on
that
report.
mr.
john
charles
boger
i'm
sorry.
i
think
they
can...
i'm
not
clear
on
that,
but
i
thought
there
could
be
dissenting
opinions
by...
by
a
member
of
a
committee.
mr.
john
charles
boger
no.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
charles
boger
well,
let
me...
let
add,
your
honor,
it's
not
as
if
congress
was
unaware
of
other
voices.
there
had
been
legislation
virtually
every
session
of
congress
from
1953
through
1988
proposing
habeas
corpus
amendments.
the
voices
of
the
attorney
generals
and
others
have
been
quite
firm
in
those
legislative
debates.
there
have
been
floor
debates
as
well.
indeed,
in
1966
there
was
a
proposal
to
enact
a
negligence
standard.
and
on
the
floor,
the
congressional
record
reflects,
that...
that
proposal
was
rejected.
so,
of
course,
congressional
disapproval
of
a
bill
is
not
decisive,
but
seen
in
the
context
of
the
approval
of
standards
that
reflect
and
are
said
to
reflect
sanders
v.
united
states,
i
think
it's,
it's
awfully
strong
legislative
history,
your
honor.
mr.
john
charles
boger
well,
my
understanding
of
the
way
the...
both
the
substantive
law
works
and
the
rules
enabling
act
works
is
that
this
court
may
propose
rules
to
congress
which
congress
then
accepts
or
rejects.
that's
what
happened.
that
dialogue
took
place
with
rule
9(b).
a
proposed
rule
which
contained
language
which
congress
feared
might
give
too
great
a
discretion
to
dismiss
successive
petitions
was
rejected.
that
seems
to
me
is
the
congressional
response
saying,
no,
we
don't
want
a
rule
that
may
go
that
far.
that's
precisely
what
the
report
said
in
explaining
the
change
in
rule
9(b)
back
to
the
language
"or
otherwise
abuse
of
the
writ.
"
so,
i
don't
think
the
court
has
power,
if,
if
congress
has
acted
in
a
statutory
area
like
habeas
corpus,
to
disregard
that
rule,
that
standard
that
congress
has
set.
one
can
contrast
this
with
the
procedural
default
area.
where
congress
is
silent,
where
congress
has
not
spoken
a
jurisprudence
can
develop.
and
certainly
this
court
has
developed
such
a
jurisprudence
in
cases
from
davis
and
francis
on
through
sykes
and
engle
v.
isaacs
and
so
forth.
that's
not
the
history
of
successive
petition
law.
successive
petition
law
by
contrast,
by
marked
contrast,
has
had
two
congressional
interventions
in
this
period,
and
both
of
them
reflect
strong
adherence
to
the
sanders
v.
united
states
standard.
let
me,
though,
move
to
the
new
law
claim
that
is
among
those
that
our
client
tried
to
present
in
his
first
application.
he
sought
to
raise
a
claim
under
estelle
v.
smith,
a
1981
decision
of
this
court.
ms.
boleyn
wants
to
suggest
that
estelle
v.
smith
was
foreordained,
was
clear
to
any
reasonable
counsel.
but
it's
not
at
all
clear.
it
certainly
wasn't
in
1978
when
mr.
moore
filed
his
first
federal
application,
that
the
fifth
amendment
rights
survived
the
guilt
determination
at
a
trial.
i
remember
being
here
in
the
court
for
oral
argument
in
1980
when
estelle
v.
smith
was
argued.
i
remember
the
texas
attorney
general
saying
there
simply
is
no
right
of
self-incrimination
left
once
guilt
has
been
adjudicated.
that
was
conventional
wisdom
in
1980.
indeed,
in
estelle
v.
smith
itself,
three
justices
of
this
court
declined
to
reach
the
fifth
amendment
ground,
the
self-incrimination
ground.
and
one,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
says
i'm
not
at
all
persuaded
that
there
is
a
fifth
amendment
right
that
survives
the
guilt
determination.
there's
contemporary
evidence
that,
that
demonstrates
exactly
how
novel
that
rule
was
at
the
time.
justice
kennedy
may
remember
a
case
of
bauman
v.
united
states
out
of
the
ninth
circuit,
which
was
a
1982
decision
that
came
up
less
than
a
year
after
estelle
v.
smith.
an
estelle
claim
was
raised
in
bauman,
but
the
ninth
circuit
said
we
do
not
blame
the
district
court
for
giving
this
claim
short
shrift.
it
arose
only
a
month
before
estelle
v.
smith
was
decided,
and
until
that
time,
until
estelle
was
pronounced
by
this
court,
we
know
of
no
supreme
court
opinion
or
circuit
court
opinion
that
ever
suggested
that
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights
addressed
in
estelle
v.
smith
extend
past
the
guilt
determination
phase
and
into
the
sentencing
phase
of
trial.
that
was
a
ninth
circuit
contemporaneous,
if
you
would,
witness
to
the
novelty
of
estelle
v.
smith.
the
fifth
circuit
itself
subsequently
held,
as
we
cited
in
our
brief,
in
gray
v.
lucas
that
reasonable
counsel
in
1979,
a
year
after
mr.
moore
had
filed
his
petition,
could
not
have
been
expected
to
foresee
a
change
like
that
in
estelle
v.
smith.
there's
an
additional
point
on
estelle,
and
that
is
that
our
client,
mr.
moore,
is
not
in
the
shoes
of
ernest
benjamin
smith
himself.
it
was
not
a
psychiatric
interview
that
mr.
moore
has
challenged.
instead,
he
has
extended
estelle
v.
smith
to
the
probation
officer
context.
if
estelle
itself
was
a
surprise,
was
novel,
we
submit
that
the
extension
of
estelle
to
the
probation
officer's
situation
was
far
from
clear
to
counsel,
even
reasonable
counsel,
other
than
moore's
in
1978.
my
understanding,
indeed,
is
this
court
granted
certiorari
last
term
in
cox
v.
vermont
to
ask
and
answer
the
question
whether
estelle
applies
in
non-capital
cases
to
probation
officer
reports.
the
matter
is
still
unresolved
in
1978...
or
1988.
once
again,
bauman
held,
the
ninth
circuit
case,
that
in
the
probation
officer
setting,
estelle
v.
smith
didn't
apply.
bauman
also
pointed
out
that
it
was
a
non-capital
case
and
made
some
capital/non-capital
distinctions
which
i
think
are
quite
important.
but
what
i'm
trying
to
do
is
to
suggest
that
estelle
was
far
from
clear
in
1978
or
even
'80
or
'81
or
'82.
there
are
other
cases
that
i
could
cite
that
express
the
sense
of
the
novelty
of
that
doctrine,
but
let
me
move
on
for
a
moment
to
proffitt
v.
wainwright,
a
second
new
law
claim.
when
this
case
was
decided
by
justice
crabbage...
or
judge
crabbage
in
the
eleventh
circuit
in
1982,
four
years
after
mr.
moore
had
come
into
federal
habeas
for
the
first
time,
she
wrote
whether
the
right
to
cross-examine
adverse
witnesses
extends
to
capital
sentencing
proceedings
has
not
been
specifically
addressed
by
the
supreme
court
and
is
an
issue
of
first
impression
in
this
circuit.
our
research
suggested
maybe
at
that
time,
1982,
an
issue
of
first
impression
everywhere.
the
state,
of
course,
has
cited
gardner
v.
florida,
and
said
gardner
clearly
presaged
proffitt
v.
wainwright.
we
respectfully
disagree.
gardner
merely
held
that
presentence
reports
could
be
made
available
to
defense
counsel
for
their
rebuttal.
it
said
nothing
about
whether
the
longstanding,
widespread
practice
of
submission
of
written
documents
at
sentencing
was
to
all
of
a
sudden
be
overturned,
and
any
defense
counsel
who
wanted
to
cross-examine
anyone
who
had
filed
a
document
as
part
of
that
report
could
come
into
court
and
be
confronted
and
cross-examined.
i'm
still
not
sure
whether
proffitt
has
been
extended
very
far
in,
in
the
non-capital
context
to
this
date.
we
don't
have
very
much
information
that
i've
been
able
to
amass
on
that.
so,
in
other
words--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--that's
correct.
it's
not
yet
a
decision
this
court
has
passed
on.
my,
my
point,
once
again,
is
that
these
claims
in
retrospect
may
seem
obvious
once
all
of
the
woof
and
the
warp
has
been
put
together.
they're
far
from
obvious
at
the
time.
it's
as
if
one
were
to
say
of
a
chemist
that
the
atomic
table
was
always
present.
so,
therefore,
it's
obvious
that
someone
should
have
come
up
with
the
new
formula
that
has
been
devised.
let
me
move
quickly,
though,
to
the
gardner
v.
florida
claim
because
i
think--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--the,
the
state
court
does
make
a
holding
that
the
claim
is
without
merit.
it
does
so
after
it
recites
a
portion
of
the
sentencing
transcript
where
the
report
is
put
into
evidence
and
an
affidavit
from
the
probation
officer
who
says
that
he
gave
the
report
to
defendant...
the
defendant's
counsel
and
saw
defendant's
counsel
discuss
the
confession
portion.
mr.
john
charles
boger
we
don't
know
why
mr....
mr.
bonner
did
not.
of
course,
the
respondent
did
through
substitute
counsel
the
day
after
she
entered
the
case.
and
i
want
to
clarify
the
question
a
little
further
that
justice
stevens
asked.
mr.
bonner
did
not
raise
the
gardner
claim.
he
was
the
initial
counsel.
but
he
filed
the
petition
and
very
shortly
thereafter
moved
to
withdraw
from
the
case
citing
to
the
federal
judge
that
he
was
overworked,
that
he
thought
that
mr.
moore's
constitutional
interest
would
suffer
prejudice
if
he
continued
in
the
case.
he
then
went
to
an
evidentiary
hearing
so...
or
a
status
conference,
so-called,
during
which
the
magistrate
asked
him
if
he
wanted
to
put
on
evidence
on
any
of
the
claims
that
were
in
the
case,
and
he
said
no.
gardner,
of
course,
was
not
in
the
case,
so
he
never
said
we
don't
need
any
more
evidence
taken
on
the
gardner
point.
when
subsequently
mr.
bonner
left
the
case
and
new
counsel
came
in,
still
seven
months
before
the
district
court
decided
it,
new
counsel
immediately
moved
to
amend
to
add
the
gardner
claim,
which
had
been
exhausted.
she
asked
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
the
claim.
and
let
me
explain,
justice
o'connor,
what
that
evidentiary
hearing
was
intended
to
do.
although
it
may
have
been
true
that
the
74-page
report
in
toto
was
given
to
mr.
pierce,
the
trial
counsel,
during
the
proceeding,
there
is
no
finding
on
whether
he
realized
that
within
that
report
there
was
a
five-page
narrative
by
officer
rachels
that
contained
a
good
deal
of
the
most
damaging
evidence
that
was
submitted
against
the
defendant.
there
is
certainly
no
finding
on
whether
he
realized
that
was
in
the
larger
document.
indeed,
he
both
signed
affidavits
and
swore
in
state
habeas
corpus
proceedings
that
he
never
saw
it.
moreover,
there's
certainly
no
finding
on
whether
the
opportunity
afforded
was
reasonable.
under
federal
standards,
rule
32
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
to
hand
counsel
a
presentence
report
at
the
very
outset
of
the
sentencing
hearing
would
likely
not
be
deemed
reasonable.
and
certainly
our
argument
is
under
gardner
this
was
unreasonable
notice.
whatever
kind
of
notice
it
was,
it
wasn't
sufficient
notice
for
mr.
pierce
to
have
realized
that
his
client's
whole
case
was
being
jeopardized
by
this
report
because
the
report
included,
among
other
things,
the
suggestion
that
mr.
moore
had
10
prior
crimes
when
in
fact
he
had
four
juvenile
adjudications.
the
report
suggested
that
the
crime
was
a
great
deal
more
deliberate
and
premeditated.
for
example,
it's
the
only
document...
the
only
evidence
before
the
sentencing
judge
that
mr.
moore
may
have
fired
first.
the
sentencing
report...
the
presentence
report
suggests
mr.
moore
began
firing
four
or
five
shots,
and
the
victim
fired
in
response.
every
other
document
and
every
other
piece
of
testimony
in
this
case
is
that
mr.
moore
entered
the
bedroom
window,
came
into
the
living
room.
the
bedroom
door
opened.
the
victim
came
out
of
the
bedroom
door
in
the
dark,
hit
mr.
moore
on
the
leg
with
a
shotgun
barrel,
fired
the
shotgun,
and
then
mr.
moore,
who
was
drunk,
responded
by
firing
four
or
five
shots
from
his
pistol.
the
degree
of
deliberation,
on
the
one
hand,
cold-bloodedly
shooting
this
man
four
or
five
times,
on
the
other
hand,
responding
to
his
own
initial
shot
with
the
shotgun
is
a
very
serious
one
in
terms
of
judging
the
heinousness
of
this
crime.
and
it
was
the
presentence
report
that
contained
that
one
variant
account,
an
account
that
the
judge
apparently
credited
because
his
trial
judge's
report,
which
judges
submit
in
georgia
at
the
state
supreme
court,
reflected
that
view
of
the
crime.
there
are
other
serious
errors
and
omissions
in
that
presentence
report
as
well.
let
me...
let
me
add
that
the
district
judge
who
is
the
closest
to
this
case
and
saw
the
facts
in
the
greatest
degree
of
complexity
was
the
person
who
suggested
that,
that
if
mr.
pierce
had
failed
to
see
this
report,
an
issue
which
he
didn't
pass
on,
as
justice
stevens
points
out,
since
he
never
reached
the
merits
of
the
claim,
he
thinks
that
a
wrongful
sentence
may
have
been
imposed
based
on
inadequate
information.
mr.
john
charles
boger
initially,
your
honor,
he
denied
the
motion
to
amend
to
add
the
gardner
claim
in
the
context
of
granting
full
sentencing
relief
on
another
issue.
in
other
words,
let
me...
let
me
explain
the
status
of
this
case.
ms.
hicks
comes
in
the
case
in
the
fall
of
1980.
she
immediately
raises
the
gardner
claim
among
several
others.
mr.
john
charles
boger
she
filed
a
motion
to
amend
saying
i
want
to
amend
to
add
in
the
gardner
claim.
at
this
point
it
is
unclear
even
who
the
judge
is
because
judge
lawrence
who
originally
had
the
case
had
died
and
there
had
been
about
a
year
in
which
there
had
been
no
activity.
so,
so,
she
filed
a
motion
for
clarification
of
who
the
judge
was.
that
was
clarified.
she
filed
a
motion
for
an
evidentiary
hearing.
she
wrote
a
letter
to
the
court
saying
there's...
i
want
to
sort
of
begin
to,
to
reassemble
this
case.
i
want
to
explain
what
issues
we
believe
are
before
the
court,
ready
for
a
hearing,
what
issues
we've
move
to
add
and
seek
a
hearing
on,
and
what
issues
we
have
to
go
back
and
exhaust
further
in
the
state
courts.
so,
she
filed
a
series
of
documents
which
reflect
that
attempt
to
reorganize
the
case.
what,
what
followed
is
that
the
district
judge
in
april
of
the
following
year
without
notice
denied
the
motion
to
amend,
denied
her
motion
for
a
hearing--
mr.
john
charles
boger
--oh,
none
at
all.
none
at
all.
mr.
john
charles
boger
i
simply
meant
that
ms.
hicks,
and
by
this
time
mr.
givelber,
didn't
know
until
they
had
received
full
sentencing
relief
what
the
dispositions
were
going
to
be
on
the
gardner
or
other
motions.
but
the
relief
they
received...
and
this
is
important
to
understand
as
well...
was
not
just
a
resentencing
hearing.
the
district
judge
concluded
on
a
ground
subsequently
overturned
that
mr.
moore
could
not
be
resentenced
to
death
because
his
death
sentence
was
disproportionately
excessive.
consequently,
there
was
no
point
to
go
back,
as
ms.
boleyn
suggested,
to
start
adding
estelle
claims
or
proffitt
claims
or
gardner
claims.
they
would
all
have
been
moot
applications.
the
client
at
that
point
had
a...
had
a
ruling
from
a
district
court
that
full
sentencing
relief
should
be
given.
and,
of
course,
that
was
then
what
was
litigated
up
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
john
charles
boger
that's
right.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
analysis
conducted
by
the
district
court
was
improper.
the
court
of
appeals
panel,
i
might
add,
granted
relief
on
yet
another
ground.
mr.
moore
has
had
relief
from
the
district
court,
from
the
circuit
panel
and
now
from
the
circuit
en
banc.
the
court
of
appeals
panel
said
a
non-statutory
aggravating
circumstance
played
a
major
role
in
the
sentencing
judge...
judge's
decision,
and
that's
unconstitutional.
it
unfortunately
gave
out
its
ruling
on
june
the
23rd,
the
same
day
in
which
this
court
decided
zant
v.
stephens
in
1983
and
said
a
non-statutory
aggravating
circumstance
doesn't
invalidate
the
death
sentence.
so,
once
again
mr.
moore,
who
had
obtained
relief
on
another
ground,
found
himself
without
relief.
he
pursued
those
matters
to,
to
the
supreme
court,
lost
on
certiorari,
and
at
that
point
quickly
came
in
and
filed
the
new
law
claims
under
estelle
and
proffitt
and
sought
a
first
adjudication
on
the
merits
of
the
gardner
claim.
the
district
judge
denied
relief
on
the
gardner
claim,
as
you
know,
finding
that
it
was
an
abuse.
it's
a...
it's
a
difficult
finding
because
it's
not
a
second
adjudication
on
the
merits.
but
he
says
sufficient
opportunity
had
earlier
been
afforded
that
he
was
not
going
to
award
relief
or
even
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
the
merits
at
this
time.
he
didn't
consider
the
ends
of
justice
question.
the
court
of
appeals
reluctantly
or
with
some
hesitation
said
we
will
not
find
it
an
abuse
of
your
discretion,
district
court,
to
have
dismissed
this
petition
as
abusive,
but
we
do
think
the
interests
of
justice
call
for
you
to
give
further
consideration
to
whether
you
ought
to
reach
the
merits
even
if
there's
an
abuse.
our
submission
to
the
court
on
the
ends
of
justice
point
is
that
no
matter
what
standards
the
court
majority
ultimately
holds
meet
the
ends
of
justice
test,
mr.
moore
will
be
one
of
the
people
who
falls
within
the
core
of
that
test.
in
kuhlmann
v.
wilson,
four
members
of
the
court,
as
you
remember,
suggested
that
ends
of
justice
might
be
best
defined
in
terms
of
actual
factual
innocence.
and
then
in
a
related
context
in
smith
v.
murray,
a
majority
of
the
court
suggested
that
in
the
capital
sentencing
phase,
the
receipt
of
false
or
misleading
information
was
sufficient
to
meet
that
related
test
for
procedural
default.
well,
what
we
have
in
this
case
is
precisely
that.
the
receipt
of
false
and
misleading
information
by
the
sentencing
judge
upon
which
he
relied,
with
the
district
court
finding
that
it
may
well
have
made
a
life
or
death
difference,
that
is
within
the
core
of
the
equity
jurisprudence
that
has
long
marked
habeas
corpus.
and
for
that
reason,
we've
submitted
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
certainly
right
to
remand
this
case
in
the
interest
of
justice.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
