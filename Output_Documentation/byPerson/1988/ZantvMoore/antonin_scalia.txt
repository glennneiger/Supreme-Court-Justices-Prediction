could
you...
could
you
tell
me
how
it
could
ever
be
held
that
the
claim...
that
the
claim
was
not
reasonably
available
when
there
has
been
a
change
in
the
law?
i
mean,
almost
by
definition
somebody
else
thought
of
it.
so,
how
could
you
possibly
ever...
i
mean,
why
not
just
adopt
a
simpler
rule
that
you
simply
can't
do
it
at
all?
period.
is
there
any
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
at
least
if
he...
if
his
trial
where
he
didn't
raise
the
point
was
simultaneous
with
the
trial
in
which
the
point
was
raised
that
came
up
here
that
produced
the
decision
which
is
allegedly
new
law,
at
least
in
all
those
cases
you
would
have
to
say
it
was
reasonably
available,
wouldn't
you?
so,
you
would
only
be
talking
about
those
cases
that
were
earlier
than
the
one
at
which
the
point
was
first
raised.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
in
your
green
example,
somebody,
somebody
prior
to
green
had
the...
had
the
necessary
tools.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
else
green
would
not
have
been
decided
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
how
can
you
even
say
that
with
respect
to
green?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
what
if...
what
if
i
didn't
agree
with
that...
what
legislative
report
was
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
i
were
a
member
of
the
senate,
could
i
have
voted
against
that
report?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
a
member
of
the
senate
vote
against
a
report?
i
didn't
know
that
a
report
went
up
for
a
vote.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
member
of
the
committee,
but
certainly
the
rest
of
the
senate
didn't
vote
on
the
report,
did
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
hanging
an
awful
lot
on,
on,
on
the
report
from
the
committee,
and
you're
speaking
as
though
congress
said
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
it...
granting,
granting
all
that
you
say,
why
does
it...
and
maybe
this
is
the
same
as
the
chief
justice's
question...
why
does
it
show
anything
more
than
that
congress
was
not
willing
to
change
the
rule?
you,
you,
you
have
to
establish
something
further
than
that,
namely,
that
congress
did
not
want
us
to
be
able
to
change
the
rule.
