justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one,
one
preliminary
question?
you're
basically
asking
us
to
overrule
sanders,
are
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
accept
the
interpretation
of
abuse
of
the
writ
terms
in
sanders?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
sure
that's...
i'm
not
sure
that's
answering
my
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
agree
with
what...
do
you
agree
with
everything
in
the
sanders
opinion,
i'll
put
it
that
way,
insofar
as
it
discusses
abuse
of
the
writ
and
rule
9(b)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
agree
with
everything
in
the
opinion?
if
not,
what
do
you
disagree
with?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
make
sure
of
one...
your
point
on
the
gardner
claim?
did
he
have
a...
have
a
federal
habeas
corpus
hearing
on
the
merits
of
the
gardner
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so,
then
he...
is
it
correct
that
he
has
never
had
a
hearing
in
federal
court
on
the
merits
of
his
gardner
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
isn't
he
entitled
to
a
hearing
now?
i'm
not
quite
clear.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
there's
no
merit...
it's
wrong
on
the
merits.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
has
been
determined
wrong
on
the
merits
by
the
state
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
point
on
the
gardner
claim
is
not
that
it's
without
merit,
but
rather
it
was
deliberately
withheld.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
can't
be
both,
can
it?
how,
how
could
it...
if
it
was
never
litigated,
how
can
you
say
it
has
no
merit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
and...
and
no
federal
court
has
passed
on
the
accuracy
of
that
contention.
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
you
say
they
switched
it
around,
who...
i'm
still
not...
it's
a
little
difficult
to
keep
all
the
facts
clearly
in
mind.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
switched
it
around
in
federal
court
or
in
state--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
has
the...
has
the
federal
court
ever
decided
they
did
have
an
adequate
chance
to
look
at
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
sounds...
from
the
way
you
describe
it,
it
sounds
like
the
district
court
made
a
factual
determination
without
taking
evidence
on
the
point.
