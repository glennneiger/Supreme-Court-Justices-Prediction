ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
second
application
for
federal
habeas
corpus
relief
that
raises
both
old
and
new
grounds.
on
the
new
grounds,
they
allege
that
a
change
in
the
law
permits
them
to
present
these
new
claims
for
the
first
time
in
a
second
or
subsequent
application.
it's
the
petitioner's
position
that
the
failure
of
the
respondent
to
include
these
so-called
new
claims
in
his
first
application
was
inexcusable
neglect
and,
therefore,
this
application
should
have
been
dismissed
as
an
abuse
of
the
writ.
there
are
three
major
points
which
the
petitioner
would
like
to
discuss
today
and
these
three
points
are
as
follows.
first,
when
a
district
court
is
faced
with
reviewing
a
second
or
subsequent
application
for
federal
habeas
corpus
relief
that
raises
new
claims
based
on
alleged
changes
in
the
law,
the
district
court
should
not
focus
on
whether
or
not
the
decision
that's
cited
by
the
applicant
is
in
fact
new
law.
instead,
the
proper
focus
of
the
district
court's
consideration
should
be
whether
at
the
time
the
first
application
was
filed
and
it
was
pending
in
the
district
court
that
the
claim
was
reasonably
available
to
the
applicant
at
that
time.
the
second
point
the
petitioner
would
like
to
make
is
that
reasonably
available
means
was
there
a
sufficient
legal
basis
in
existence
at
the
time
the
first
application
was
filed
and
during
the
time
it
was
pending
to
enable
the
applicant
to
raise
the
claim.
and
finally,
under
our
standard
that
we're
proposing
to
the
court
today,
the
burden
would
remain
on
the
applicant
to
excuse
his
omission
of
the
new
claims
from
the
earlier
application
and
to
show
that
it
was
not
inexcusable
neglect
to
fail
to
include
these
claims.
if
we
take
the
reasonably
available
standard
that
we're
propounding
to
the
court
today
and
apply
it
in
the
practical
context,
this
is
what
occurs.
of
course,
the
applicant
files
a
second
or
successive
application
for
federal
habeas
corpus
relief
and
the
government,
as
is
its
burden,
pleads
abuse
of
the
writ
with
clarity
and
particularity.
and
essentially
implicit
in
our
response
to
their
second
or
successive
application
is
our
belief
that
there
is
no
newly
available
facts
and
no
newly
available
law
which
would
allow
the
applicant
to
raise
a
claim
at
this
time
which
he
didn't
have
at
a
previous
application
time.
of
course,
once
we
plead
abuse
of
the
writ
and
we
say
that
there's
new...
no
new
law,
then
of
course
the
applicant
has
to
respond
to
the
pleading
of
abuse
of
the
writ.
and
what
generally
happens
is
they
simply
say
change
in
the
law
and
they
cite
a
case
for
it
that
was
rendered
subsequent
to
the
time
that
the
first
application
was
disposed
of.
they
hope
by
mouthing
what
are
sometimes
thought
of
as
magic
words
of
"change
in
the
law",
that
they
can
thereby
excuse
their
inexcusable
neglect
in
failing
to
raise
that
claim
at
the
first
time.
and,
of
course,
they
also
hope
that
what
will
happen
is
that
the
district
court
will
look
to
the
government
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
claim
was
reasonably
available
at
that
time.
when
the
district
court
then
is
faced
with
our
allegation
of
abuse
of
the
writ
and
their
allegation
that
there's
new
law,
what
does
the
district
court
have
to
do?
well,
essentially
the
district
court
can't
decide
whether
the
decision
is
new
law
in
a
legal
vacuum.
instead,
what
the
district
court
has
to
do
is
look
at
the
claim
and
decide
whether
or
not
at
the
time
the
first
application
was
filed
and
was
pending
that
the
claim
was
reasonably
available.
so,
they
compare
the
date
of
the
decision
cited
back
to
the
date
that
the
first
application
was
filed.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
your
honor,
our
reasonably
available
standard
differs
from
the,
the
standards
set
forth
in
reed
v.
ross
for
the
cause
standard
in
several
respects.
first
of
all,
our
standard
is
not
as
high
a
standard
as
a
reed
v.
ross
standard
because
we
don't
have
the
additional
element
of
prejudice.
and
second,
of
course,
primarily
when
you're
discussing
a
procedural
default,
you're
looking
at
whether
counsel
failed
to
preserve
the
issue
and
why
the
issue
was
not
preserved;
whereas
on
our
reasonably
available
standard,
the
focus
that
you
have
is
why
the
claim
could
not
have
been
presented.
so,
really
in
a
procedural
default
context,
a
reed
v.
ross
type
situation,
one
of
the
things
you're
looking
at
is
foreseeability;
whereas
in
our
test
you
have
the
benefit
of
hindsight
and
you
can
look
back
to
the
legal
environment
as
it
existed
at
the
time
the
first
application
was
filed.
then,
of
course,
too,
when
you're
looking
at
a
procedural
default
context,
the
prior
proceeding
that
you're
examining
is
a
proceeding
in
which
you
had
the
right
to
counsel
and
you
had
the
right
to
effective
assistance
because
it's
trial
or
appeal.
but
in
our
standard,
you're
looking
at
a
proceeding
where
you
did
not
have
the
right
to
counsel
and
so,
in
effect,
it
just
doesn't
factor
in.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
our
standard
is
very
similar
to
that
of
judge
tjoflat.
we
just...
he,
he
used
the
tools
language
of
reed
v.
ross,
and
we
simply
said
was
it
reasonably
available,
was
there
a
sufficient
legal
basis
for
the
claim.
and
it's
similar
for
the
tools
language
that
judge
tjoflat
adopted.
the
only
thing
that
judge
tjoflat
did
was
he
referred
to
the
reed
v.
ross
language
about
whether
other
petitioners
were
raising
the
claim
at
the
same
time.
and
we've
simply
said
in
our
standard
that
that
might
be
germane,
but
it
might
not
be
outcome-determinative
in
determining
whether
the
claim
was
reasonably
available.
so,
it's
very
similar
to
what
he's...
what
he's
alleged.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
we
think
we
have
adopted
a
simpler
rule
because
part
of
it
depends
on
the
way
you
look
at
new
law.
i
mean,
new
law
could
be
viewed
as
every
decision
that
this
court
decides
or
every
decision
that
any
court
decides.
so,
the
question
can't
focus
on
whether
it's
new
law
unless
you
relate
it
to
some
point
in
time.
to
say
whether
it's
new
law
for
retroactivity
purposes
or
new
law
for
prophylactic
purposes,
all
different
types
of
purposes
is
where
it's
new
law.
so,
the
only
way
you
can
do
when
you're
in
a
habeas
corpus
setting
is
you
have
to
look
at
the
conduct
of
the
applicant
for
the
writ.
and
when
you're
looking
at
his
conduct,
you
have
to
look
at
the
point
in
time
when
he
sought
to
avail
himself
of
the
federal
habeas
corpus
remedy.
so,
the
new
law
or
the,
the
decision
only
has
relevance
in
the
context
of
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
back
to
the
time
of
the
first
application.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
you
would
only
be
talking
about
those
cases
that
were
earlier
than
the
one
in
which
the
point
raised,
but
that
would
not
necessarily
be
an
excuse
because
you
could
have--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--earlier
decisions
that
foreshadowed
the
new
or
clear
break
or
precedent-setting
decision.
we're
not
going
to
have
to
wait
until
this
court
gives
a
decision
to
hold
that
it
would
be
reasonable
for
an
applicant
to
raise
the
claim.
of
course,
as
this
court
is
aware,
many
of
the
1960s
and
1970
cases
clearly
outlined
for
persons
dealing
in
federal
habeas
corpus
the
expansion
of
rights
that
was
going
to
be
available
to
criminal
defendants
and
foreshadowed
many
of
the
decisions
that
came
out
in
the
1970s
and
1980s.
so,
you
had
the
tools.
you
had
these
basic
decisions,
and
applying
them
to
the
factual
context
in
which
you're
dealing
with
is
the
job
of
the
attorney.
he
has
got
to
have
some
ability
to
determine
whether
there
are
some,
some
basic
landmark
cases
out
there
that
might
be
extended
to
cover
the
factual
situation
that's
in
that
case.
so--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--your
honor,
that's
a
difficult
question
to
ask
unless
you
can
pinpoint
the
time
period
that
we're
talking
about
i
think,
as
i've
already
said.
but
let's
suppose
that
you
are
a,
a
capital
litigant
in
georgia
in
the
period
between
gregg
v.
georgia,
1976,
and
green
v.
georgia.
and
in
green
v.
georgia,
of
course,
they
said
that
the
hearsay
prohibitions
under
georgia
law
weren't
applicable
to
the
sentencing
phase.
it's
possible
that
a
petitioner
in
that
time
period
between
those
two
decisions
would
have
no
reasonably
available
basis
to
allege
that
the
hearsay
prohibitions
that
are...
that
are
in
the
guilt
phase
were
also
applicable
to
the
sentencing
phase
since
those
two
phases
under
georgia
law
are
the
same.
so,
it's
arguable
that
that's
an
example
of
a
case
which
was
clearly
new
law,
at
least
under
georgia
law,
to
require
those
hearsay
restrictions
to
be
taken
out
of
the
sentencing
proceeding.
so,
arguably
he
might
have
a,
a
claim
based
on
that
that
would
be
excusable
neglect
for
failing
to
raise
it
in
the
first
application.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
your
honor,
i've
spent
a
lot
of
time
thinking
about
that.
some
of
the
major
1980s
examples
that
i
can
think
of
would
depend
on
the
state
of
the
law
in
other
states
of
which
i'm
unfamiliar.
for
example,
caldwell
v.
mississippi.
the
caldwell...
so-called
caldwell
argument
has
been
against
the
law
in
georgia
for
200
years.
apparently
it
wasn't
against
the
law
in
mississippi.
so,
perhaps
some
applicant,
depending
on
the
timing
of
their
first
and
second
applications,
caldwell
v.
mississippi
might
be
new
law
in
their
jurisdiction.
so,
the
problem
is
if
you...
if
you
don't
place
it
in
the
context
of
a
particular
jurisdiction
or
a
particular
time
frame,
it's
difficult
to
answer
whether
some
of
the
major
decisions
that
we're
all
familiar
with
really
would
be
an
excuse
in
the
abstract.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes,
they
did.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes,
they
did.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
well,
i
think
you'd
have
to
look
at
the
circumstances.
first
of
all,
you'd
have
to
look
at
what
would
be
reasonable
in
that
time
frame,
what
decisions
they
had
that
might
have
foreshadowed
green.
and
that's
why
i
say
it's
possibly
an
excuse.
it
wouldn't
necessarily
be
an
excuse.
and
the
only
reason
i
use
that
is
because
i'm
familiar
with
georgia
law,
so
that
might
possibly
be
an
excuse
for
him.
but
even
still,
of
course,
you
know,
stare
decisis
and
all
of
the
decisions
of
the
court
really
rely
on
something
else.
the
question
is
maybe
under
georgia
law
or
some
other
authority
that
i'm
not
familiar
with,
that
claim
could
be
made.
but
the
fact
that...
that
somebody
was...
was
smart
enough
to
raise
a
claim
that
ultimately
got
relief
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
it
was
unreasonable
for
them
not
to
raise
it
previously.
if
we
apply
the
reasonably
available
analysis
to
the
new
law
claims
in
this
application,
this
is
what
results.
there's
two
new
law
claims.
the
first
of
these
in
our
case
is
the
proffitt
v.
wainwright
claim.
and
essentially
when
we
pled
abuse
of
the
writ,
the
respondent
in
this
case
said
i
needed
proffitt
to
make
this
claim.
without
proffitt,
this
claim
was
unavailable
to
me
at
the
time
of
the
first
application.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
no,
we're
not,
your
honor.
our
view
of
sanders
is
that
is
to
prohibit
piecemeal
litigation
which
sanders
defines
as
any
litigation
whose
intent
is
to
vex,
harass
or
delay.
and--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--your
honor,
if
you
look
at
sanders,
plus
rule
9(b)
and
the
advisory
notes
referring
back
to
sanders,
they
talk
about
several
types
of
abuse
of
the
writ
that
are
available.
intentional--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--may...
if
you'd
restate,
your
honor,
i'll
try
to
be--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--insofar
as
it
states
that
equitable
principles
govern
habeas
corpus,
insofar
as
it
states
that
any
type
of--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--insofar
as
some
courts
have
read
sanders
to
limit
abuse
of
the
writ
solely
to
types
of
things
like
sandbagging
or
deliberate
withholding,
i
would
disagree
with
those
interpretations
of
sanders.
my
interpretation
of
sanders
is
that
it
prohibits
any
types
of
abuse
of
the
writ
and
it
gives
illustrative
examples
that
we
say
are
nonexhaustive
of
what
type
of
proceedings
would
abuse
the
writ.
but
when
they
put
that
word
"delay"
in
there,
they're
talking
about
capital
litigation.
they
are
talking
about
the
fact
that
it's
commonplace
now
for
capital
litigants
to
file
a
second
round
of
federal
habeas
corpus
proceedings
whose
only
intent
is
to
delay.
and
so
that
part
of
sanders
directly
feeds
in
to
this
case
and
to
our,
our
abuse
of
the
writ
standard.
again,
if
we
try
to
apply
the
reasonably
available
standard
to
the
two
claims
that
we
have
here,
the
first
one
is
proffitt
v.
wainwright.
and
as
i've
said,
they
said
until
the
fifth
circuit
entered
proffitt
v.
wainwright,
we
could
not
have
raised
the
claim.
under
our
analysis,
then
of
course
in
our
pleading
of
abuse
of
the
writ,
we
would
tell
them,
as
we
did
tell
them,
that
proffitt
was
based
on...
primarily
on
gardner
v.
florida,
and
that
in
gardner
v.
florida
in
1977
this
court
clearly
foreshadowed
the
result
that
the
fifth
circuit
reached
in
proffitt.
and,
of
course,
gardner
was
decided
in
1977,
and
this
application,
the
federal
habeas
corpus
relief,
the
initial
one,
was
filed
in
november
of
1978.
and
then,
of
course,
gardner
had
prior
law
supporting
it:
this
court,
douglas
v.
alabama,
california
v.
green,
chambers
v.
mississippi.
so,
if
you
didn't
want
to
use
gardner,
you
still
had
other
similar
decisions
of
this
court
that
you
could
have
relied
on.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
no,
we
did
not
address
the
retroactivity
question,
solely
on
abuse.
so,
essentially
they
said
we
needed
proffitt
to
make
this
claim.
our
response
is
you
didn't
need
the...
you
didn't
need
proffitt
because
you
had
gardner
v.
florida
and
the
prior
decisions
in
that.
and
therefore,
since
you
didn't
need
it
to
raise
the
claim,
the
claim
was
reasonably
available
to
you
in
1978.
since
it
was
reasonably
available,
your
failure
to
present
it
was
inexcusable
neglect,
and
since
inexcusable
neglect
is
one
of
the
forms
of
abuse
of
the
writ
now
that
abuses
have
become
more
sophisticated,
then
therefore
you
have
abused
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
you
are
not
entitled
to
review
this
issue
on
the
merits.
with
reference
to
the
other
new
law
claim,
estelle
v.
smith,
again
we
apply
the
reasonably
available
test
to
estelle
v.
smith.
they
say
until
this
court's
decision
in
estelle
v.
smith,
they
couldn't
have
raised
the
claim.
we
say,
yes,
you
could.
you
could
have
raised
in
re
gault.
you
could
have
used
miranda
v.
arizona,
and
you
could
have
even
used
the
district
court's
decision
in
smith
v.
estelle,
which
was
decided
one
year
before
this
first
application
was
filed,
and
if
not
that,
you
could
have
used
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
in
smith
v.
estelle,
which
was
entered
while
the
application
was
pending
in
the
district
court.
so,
we
essentially
say
you
didn't
need
this
court's
decision
in
estelle
v.
smith
to
raise
the
estelle
v.
smith
claim.
and
since
you
didn't
need
it,
the
claim
was
reasonably
available
to
you,
and
your
failure
to
present
it
constituted
inexcusable
neglect,
which
should
have
been
dismissed
as
abuse
of
the
writ.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
you
take
into...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
you
take
into
consideration
whether
there
was
any
foreclosure
of
a
right
to
object
in
the
trial.
so,
that,
that
does
work
into
the
equation,
but
the
primary
point
of
focus
is
the
time
the
application
was
filed
and
the
period
of
time
it
was
pending
in
the
district
court.
you
do
have
to
look
back
to
the
procedural
history
to
determine
whether...
what
the
existence
of
state
law
was
because
what
is
part
of
the
legal
environment
that
you're
looking
at
is...
involves
the
state
statute
and
state
law,
as
well
as
federal
law
and
federal
constitutional
principles.
the
only
claim
we
haven't
addressed
so
far
is...
and
i'll,
i'll
go
off
of
the
new
law
claims
at
this
time...
is
we
have
one
old
claim
we'd
like
to
discuss,
and
that's
the
gardner
v.
florida
claim.
we're
trying
to
take
the
easy
road
out
in
this
and
say
that
sanders
allows
us
to
determine
that
no
relitigation
of
the
gardner
claim
is
necessary
because
this
claim
is
conclusively
without
merit.
so,
we
would
not
ask
the
court
to
reach
the
ends
of
justice
on
this
old
claim
in
the
context
of
this
case.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
the
eleventh
circuit
treated
it...
judge
tjoflat,
the
dissenter
of
course,
treated
it
as
having
been--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--they
treated
it
as...
they
treated
it
as
both
in
discussing
it,
but
they
treated
it
as
an
old
claim.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes.
they
remanded
it
for
ends
of
justice
inquiry
and
they
specifically
directed
that
the
district
court
look
at
smith
v.
murray.
they
wanted
them
to
look
at
the
procedural
default
context
of
that.
as
we've
said,
we
think
the
gardner
claim
is
conclusively
without
merit.
the
gardner
claim
was
raised
both
in
the
motion
for
declaratory
judgment
before
the
state
supreme
court.
it
was
also
raised
and
fully
litigated
at
the
state
habeas
corpus
proceedings
and
found
to
be
conclusively
without
merit.
the
bottom
line
is
the
presentence
report
was
given
to
trial
counsel
and
shown
to
mr.
moore,
and
they
tried
to
litigate
that
and
prove
otherwise
and
were
unsuccessful.
it
was
also
raised,
we
might
add,
in
the
first
application
for
federal
habeas
corpus
relief,
but
only
in
the
procedural
history
portion
of
that
application.
it
was
not
raised
in
the
claims.
it
wasn't
until
two
years
later
that
they
raised
the
gardner
claim
by
means
of
amendment
when
they
switched
counsel
and
got
new
habeas
counsel
in
there.
then
they
put
the
gardner
claim
in
their
amendment.
of
course,
this
amendment
was
disallowed
by
the
district
court,
and
that
finding
was
upheld
in
the
first
appeal
in
the
eleventh
circuit.
so,
there
has
been
no
change
in
the
law,
and
there
has
been
no
change
in
the
facts
because
it's
obviously
based
on
gardner,
1977,
before
the
first
application
in
1978.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
no,
he
didn't
because
mr.
bonner,
his
first
habeas
counsel,
admitted
to
the
court
there
were
no
new
facts
that
needed
a
hearing.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
he
did--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--no,
he
has
not,
your
honor.
he
had
an
oral
argument
before
the
magistrate
which
he
simply
argued
the
points
and,
and
said
that
there
were
no
new
facts
and
he
did
not
need
an
evidentiary
hearing.
that
was
the
first
counsel,
mr.
bonner.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
there's
no--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--right.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
he's
not
entitled
to
relitigate
a
claim
that
was
exhausted
and
fully
litigated
in
the
state
courts
prior
to
the
first
application
and
we
submit
deliberately
left
out.
it
was
cited
in
the
procedural
history.
so,
we
know
that
mr.
bonner
knew
about
it.
he
was
the
attorney
who
had
litigated
in
the
state
habeas
corpus
court.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
i
think
we
both...
we've
said
both,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
the
basis
of
their
gardner
claim
has
always
been
that
they
didn't
ever
get
to
see
the
report
at
all.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes,
they
have,
your
honor.
the
district
court
said
that
this
issue
was
fully...
in
disallowing
the
amendment,
the
district
court
looked
back
at
the
development
of
the
claim
in
the
state
habeas
corpus
court,
and
he
said
he
had
no
sound
reason
to
doubt
the
judgment
of
the
state
habeas
corpus
court.
and
he
listed
the
various
findings
the
state
courts
had
made
and
said
he
saw
no
reason
and
there
was
no
new
evidence
on
that
point.
and
he
found
it
to,
to
be
unpersuasive
that
there
was
any
merit
to
the
contention
that
they
did
not
see,
see
the
presentence
report.
so,
the
main
thing
is
they've
never
been
able
to
factually
establish
that
the
report
wasn't
made
available
to
him.
then
they
sort
of
shifted
in
midstream
and
said,
well,
we
might
have
seen
it
in
that
period
that
the
judge
took
the
recess
between
the
sentencing
proceedings
taking
place
and
the
actual
pronouncement
of
sentence,
but
we
only
have
30
and
45
minutes.
no,
we
didn't
get
an
adequate
opportunity
to
see
it.
so,
they
really
switched
their
gardner
claim
around
a
little
bit
which
is
why
our
position
may
appear
to
be
inconsistent.
the
first
thing
we're
saying
it's
without
merit
because
they
did
get
to
see
the
report.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes,
in
the
amendment.
in
the
amendment
they
said
they
didn't
have
an
adequate
opportunity.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
the
federal
court
only
addressed
the,
the
amendment
and
the
merits
of
the
gardner
claim
in
the
order
disallowing
the
amendment.
that's
the
only
time
it
was
addressed
by
the
district
court.
but
it
said...
it
basically
found
it
to
be
without--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--it
had
the
evidence
of
the
state
court
proceedings,
which
there
was
no
evidence
that
it
was
not
full
and
fair.
in
fact,
counsel
had
admitted
that
they
had
no
new
evidence
and
they
didn't
request
a
thorough
evidentiary
hearing.
so,
essentially
they
had
a
full
and
fair
proceeding
in
state
court,
so
they
didn't
need
to
have
a,
a
further
litigation.
in
the
state
court
what
happened
is
mr.
pierce,
who
represented
mr.
moore
at
the
time
of
his
sentencing
proceeding...
he
testified...
and
mr.
moore
was
there
and
the
probation
officer,
who
submitted
the
report,
submitted
an
affidavit.
so,
you
had
the
three
main
parties
who
could
have
established
the
claim.
they
were
there
in
state
court
subject
to
cross-examination,
except
for
mr.
rachels
who
did
the
probation
report.
and
so,
they
could
have
presented
anything
they
wanted
to
at
the
time.
so,
there
was
really
no...
nothing
further
to
present
in
the
federal
evidentiary
hearing
except
perhaps
to
recall
them
to
hear
the
same
testimony.
and
finally,
i'll
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal
by
simply
saying
that
if
the
court
declines
to
accept
our
invitation
to
adopt
the
reasonably
available
test,
we
ask
the
court
please
to
give
the
district
courts
a
practical,
workable
test
to
evaluate
claims
of
new
law.
and
in
any
test
that
the
court
adopts
to
make
the
test
objective,
to
not
make
it
relevant
to
foreseeability
and
to
make
certain
that
the
burden
remains
on
the
applicant
to
demonstrate
that
his
omission
of
the
claim
was
not
the
result
of
inexcusable
neglect.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes,
your
honor.
you
factor
that
into
the
process.
instead
of
using
what
a
reasonable
attorney
would
have
raised,
you
use
what
a
reasonable
person
standing
in
the
shoes
of
that
particular
petitioner
could
have
raised.
so,
you
do...
you
do
incorporate
a
lower
standard
in
there
if
it's
a
pro
se
petitioner.
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
let
me
clarify
that
under
the
standard
that
we've
proposed,
which
we
think
is
clearly
authorized
by
both
sanders
and
rule
9(b),
we're
not
asking
counsel
representing
a
habeas
corpus
petitioner
to
be
able
to
foresee
all
the
types
of
matters
that
mr.
boger
has
discussed
before
the
court
this
morning.
we're
asking
them
to
look
around
them,
see
what
legal
precedents
they
have
available
and
whether
they
can
mount
a
claim
applying
those
precedents
to
the
facts
of
their
case.
that's
what
lawyers
do,
and
that's
all
that
we're
asking
them
to
do.
of
course,
it's
interesting
to
me,
if
i
were--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--excuse
me,
your
honor?
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
the
court
of
appeals
test,
your
honor,
was
that
reasonably
competent
habeas
counsel
could
not
have
foreseen
the
cases
that
ultimately
came
out.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes,
your
honor,
very
different.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
you
have
to
be
reasonably
competent
habeas
counsel,
but
you
don't
have
to
have
this
clairvoyance
that
is
implied
at
least
by...
to
some
extent--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--let
me
see
if
i
can
clarify
that.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
but
they
said
reasonably
competent
counsel
could
not
have
foreseen
the
confluence
of
all
these
decisions.
and
our
focus
is
not
what
you
could
have
foreseen
in
the
future,
but
did
you
look
around
and
was
something
reasonably
available
then.
so,
it's
a
difference
in
focus.
you
still
got
reasonable
counsel,
but
what
is
reasonable,
when
you're
looking
at
procedural
default
and
which
we
said
is...
shouldn't
be
applied
over
in
this
context,
isn't
the
same
thing
that's
reasonable
when
you're
talking
about
why
didn't
counsel
raise
the
claim.
and,
of
course,
it's
very
interesting
that...
and
my
understanding
is
that
mr.
boger
along
with
mr.
givelber
came
into
this
particular
case
in
the
district
court
right
before
decision,
and
mr.
boger
had
been
one
of
the
counsel
listed
on
behalf
of
mr.
smith
and
smith
v.
estelle
in
the
fifth
circuit.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
he
differed
with
the
standard,
your
honor,
because
he
wasn't
going
to
say
the
question
was
whether
a
reasonably
competent
habeas
attorney
could
have
foreseen.
what
he
was
talking
about
were
there
the
ingredients...
he
called
them
ingredients
instead
of
tools
i
think...
were
the
ingredients
there
to
raise
the
claim.
so,
it's
a
difference
in
focus,
and
we're,
of
course,
going
with
judge
tjoflat.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
no.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
it's
not
only
just
the
time
that
you're
focusing
on;
it's
a
matter
of
perspective.
in
one
you're
talking
about
why
was
it
not
preserved.
in
another
case,
you're
talking
about
why
was
it
not
presented.
and
if
there's,
there's
something
that
you
can
cite
for
that
principle
even
if
it's
not
directly
on
point,
then
it's
available
because
you're
always...
the
problem
is
you're
always
going
to
have
new
law.
so,
if
something
stays
in
the
district
court
long
enough
or
in
the
eleventh
circuit
or
another
court
of
appeals
long
enough,
there
are
going
to
be
new
decisions
that
you
can
cite
for
the
same
proposition.
so,
the
question
is
was
there
anything
that
you
could
use
to
cite
the
proposition
in
that
case?
and
so,
it's
more
than
just
the
point
in
time...
the
focus...
although
that's
the
most
important--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--and
were
there
decisions
then
that
they
could
use,
not
could
they
foresee
the
one
that
ultimately
came,
but
were
there
decisions
around
them
that
they
could
use
to
mount
the
claim
based
on
their
factual
situation?
so,
it's
other
than
foreseeability.
the
other
thing
that
i'd
like
to
point
out
is
that
i
don't
believe
that
the
sanders
court
could
in
any
way
envision
the
types
of
abuses
of
the
writ
that
are
taking
place
today.
i
don't
believe
that
they
could
envision
that
piecemeal
litigation
would
just
be
out...
astounding
in
its
number
and
in
the
sophisticated
types
of
abuses
of
the
writ
that
there
are.
i
think
they
viewed
abuse
of
the
writ
as
a
very
simple
form
more
like
deliberate
withholding
or
deliberate
bypass,
but
now
we
have
new
claims
and
old
claims
and
withheld
claims
and
bypass
claims
and
claims
based
on
new
law
and
claims
based
on
new
facts.
and
when
you
have
more
sophisticated
types
of
abuses,
it
cries
out
for
the
interpretation
of
the
general
standard
in
9(b)
by
this
court.
it's
interesting
to
note,
if
we
want
to
talk
about
the
committee
notes,
that
the
committee's
notes
to
rule
9(b)
say
we
are
leaving
it
to
the
courts
to
interpret
this
standard
on
a
case-by-case
basis
in
the
exercise
of
their
judicial
discretion.
so,
rule
9(b)
itself
has
left
it
to
this
court
and
other
courts
to
interpret
the
standard
because
as
sanders
simply
says,
we're
not
going
to
permit
abuse
and
abuse
is
conduct
that
is
abusive.
so,
the
question
is
what
is
abusive
conduct?
and
that's
why
they
try
to
get
around
their
own
abuse
by
talking
about
new
law
claims.
that's
all
i
have
if
there's
no
further
questions.
