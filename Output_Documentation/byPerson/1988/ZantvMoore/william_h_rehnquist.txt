we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
87-1104,
walter
zant
v.
william
neal
moore.
ms.
boleyn,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
boleyn,
you
say
the
point
of
focus
when
you're
talking
about
abuse
of
the
writ
is
what
was
available
at
the
time
of
the
first
habeas
application,
not
the
trial.
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
boleyn.
mr.
boger,
we'll
hear
from
you
now.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
congressional
choice,
mr.
boger,
do
you
think
was
involved
in
the
language
involving
the
abuse
of
the
writ
in
rule
9?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how...
how
does
the
statute
itself
read?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
colloquy
is...
is
legislative
history?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
sanders
froze
the
abuse
of
the
writ
doctrine
for
all
time?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if...
if
you
ratify
a
judicial
holding
that
left
things
fluid,
why
doesn't
the
ratification
also
leave
them
fluid?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
proffitt
is
a
decision
of
the
eleventh
circuit.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
did
he
not
reach
the
claim?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
she
immediately
raises
them,
she
files
a
motion
to
amend
the
petition?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
without
notice.
are
you
suggesting
there's
some
impropriety--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--then
why
do
you
mention
the
fact
it
was
without
notice?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that,
that
was
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
boger.
ms.
boleyn,
you
have
eight
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
is
there...
is
the
difference
only
in
the,...
the
time
on
which
you
focus?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
is
it
something
more?
it's
really
just
on
the
time,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
boleyn.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i

of
the

announce
in

of
the

of
appeals
for
the
