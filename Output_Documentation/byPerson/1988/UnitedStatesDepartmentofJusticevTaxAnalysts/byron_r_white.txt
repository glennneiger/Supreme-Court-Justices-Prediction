justice
white
of
course,
that's
not
the
entire
expense
the
department
undergoes
in
complying
with
your
request.
justice
white
is
it?
justice
white
isn't
that...
isn't
that
right?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
that
isn't
why
you
want
them.
justice
white
well,
for
$500--
justice
white
--for
$500
a
crack
you
want
it
for
the
public.
justice
white
well,
you
just
don't--
justice
white
--you
just
don't
publish
them
for
nothing.
justice
white
juris,
yes,
juris.
well,
how
about
that?
justice
white
the
books
are
available
for
sale
to--
justice
white
oh,
i
suppose
the
lawyers
in
the
department
of
justice...
the
tax
lawyers...
are
using
prentice-hall
all
the
time,
aren't
they?
justice
white
it's
much
easier
to
use
prentice-hall
than
to...
than
to
go
look
around
a
lot
of
files.
justice
white
now,
i
suppose
prentice-hall
would
be
subject
to--
justice
white
--well,
i
don't
know.
his
tax
lawyer...
his
tax
lawyer
is
trying
to
figure
out
what
he
should
do.
so,
he
looks
at
prentice-hall
and
reads
a
lot
of
cases.
justice
white
that
may
be.
justice
white
that
may
be.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
i
know.
justice
white
i
know,
but
what
if
you
did?
justice
white
i
would
suppose
that
the
department
would
have
to
give
it
to
you
under
your
definition.
justice
white
you
mean
it's
like
the
federal
supplement.
it's
unlikely
you'd
ever
want
to
get
it.
justice
white
but
if
you
did...
but
if
you
did,
you'd
be
entitled
to
it,
i
take
it,
under
your--
justice
white
isn't
it...
isn't
it
true
that
when
the...
the
justice
department
gets
all
these
opinions,
they
don't
keep
those
opinions
in
one
file.
they
pass
them
out
to
their
own.
the
only
thing...
record
that's
really
made
is
what
they
give
you.
they
give
you
a
list
of
them
all.
justice
white
that's
the
only
agency
record
that--
justice
white
--no,
but
it
isn't
made
there.
justice
white
it's
also...
if
you
added
them
all
up,
it
would
show
how
many
cases
the
government
won
and
how
many
they
lose,
how
good
the
lawyers
they've
got.
