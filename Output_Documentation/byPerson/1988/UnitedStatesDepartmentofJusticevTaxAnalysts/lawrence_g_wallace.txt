mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
freedom
of
information
act
case
reflects
the
not
unique
circumstance
that
the
federal
government
is
a
party
to
all
federal
tax
litigation,
as
it
is
to
a
number
of
other
categories
of
litigation,
such
as
federal
tort
claims
act
cases,
government
contracts,
mall
fraud
prosecutions,
foia
cases,
and
others
that
might
occur.
since
1972,
the
respondent
has
published
a
weekly
report
of
developments
in
federal
taxation
for
which
it
charges
its
subscribers
an
annual
fee
of
$595.
and
since
1979,
the
tax
division
of
the
department
of
justice,
pursuant
to
foia,
has
provided
to
respondent
and
other
commercial
tax
services
weekly
logs
of
court
decisions
of
which
the
department
has
been
informed
in
federal
tax
cases.
this
controversy
arises
out
of
26
weekly
requests
that
respondent
made
beginning
in
november
of
1984
for
the
united
states
district
court
opinions,
orders
and
decisions
in
tax
cases
identified
in
the
log
released
during
the
previous
week.
it
apparently
occurred
to
respondent
that
the
department
of
justice,
which
receives
these
orders
and
decisions
as
a
litigator,
might
be
a
either
more
reliable,
or
at
least
more
convenient,
source
of
these
decisions
than
the
courts
issuing
them
and
perhaps
part
of
the
convenience
would
be
a
less
expensive
source,
since
the
rather
elaborate
fee
provisions
under
foia
are
designed
in
large
part
to
keep
the
costs
down
in
order
to
facilitate
access
to
information
about
what
the
government
is
doing.
this
type
of
request,
whatever
its
convenience
to
the
requester,
is
quite
inconvenient
and
burdensome
to
the
government
as
a
litigator.
these
opinions
and
orders
are
not
collected
in
any
one
place
for
the
government's
convenience.
they
come
in
in
a
mass
of
paper
flow
and
by
various
routes,
and
the
managerial
problem
is
to
get
them
routed
with
reasonable
promptness
to
the
lawyer
assigned
or
the
lawyer
now
assigned
to
the
case,
since
there
is
considerable
turnover
in
the
government,
so
that
the
government
can
perform
its
responsibilities
as
a
litigator
in
the
cases,
decide
whether
to
take
an
appeal
if
the
case
has
been
lost,
proceed
to
enforce
the
judgment,
what
have
you.
these
are
not
used
by
the
department
as
a
research
tool.
they
are
used
for
purposes
of
conducting
the
litigation.
so--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--by
and
large,
these
are
received
by
clerical
personnel...
and
they
come
in
in
the
mall
in
the
department...
whose
job
it
is
to
identify
the
proper
unit,
the
proper
litigating
unit,
in
the
tax
division,
to
whom
to
send
the
opinions.
the
attorneys
receive
them
in
two
or
three
days
time
typically.
it
takes
a
while
to
distribute
them.
if
there
were
routine
duplication,
which
does
not
occur
now,
at
the
clerical
level,
further
delay
would
be
added
inevitably.
there
are
backups
for
these
machines.
they
break
down,
et
cetera.
the
lawyers
are
not
always
present.
they
do
not
routinely
reproduce
these
items.
there
is
no
repository
where
they're
kept.
they're
not
used,
for
example,
by
the
bulk
of
lawyers
in
the
tax
division
itself
as
a
research
source.
unless
the
lawyer
happens
to
be
the
lawyer
on
the
case
or
a
close
colleague
who
knows
of
it,
they
are
much
more
apt
to
use
the
loose-leaf
services
in
the
library--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--like
any
other
lawyer
to
find
out
about
recent
developments.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
department
xxx--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
lawyers
are
spread
out
over
several
buildings.
there
would
be
delays.
it
could...
it
could
be
done.
obviously,
if
congress
ordained
it
or
the
court
determined
that
congress
has
ordained
it,
the
department
would
comply.
but
there
are
cumulative
costs
to
having
to
comply
with
requests
of
this
sort.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
one
of
our
two
contentions.
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
is
the...
the
factual
background
of
the
case,
and
it
has
to
do
with
contentions
that
are
being
made
about
why
the
statute
should
be
interpreted
so
as
to
put
requesters
on
an
even
playing
field
and
that
sort
of
thing,
which
we
think
are
contentions
that
are
overdrawn.
but
i'll
proceed
to
the
statutory
issues
in
just
a
moment,
if
i
may
just
finish
this
thought--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--about
the
deeper
costs
that
are
involved
by
the
cumulative
burden
of
devoting
personnel
in...
of
course,
in
piecemeal
fashion,
and
devoting
reproducing
facilities
to
tasks
of
this
kind.
it
becomes
a
cumulative
distraction
from
the
conduct
of
other
public
business.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
record
shows
that
there
are
20,000
tax
cases
per
year,
but
it
does
not
break
that
down
into
district
court
and
other
cases,
nor
does
it
show
how
many
district
court
cases
might
result
in
numerous
orders
being
issued.
the
request
is
for
individual
orders
as
well
as
decisions.
but
we're...
we're
talking
about
a
considerable
number
of
tax
decisions.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
any
order
that's
issued
is
part
of
the
log,
and
the
request
is
for
anything
that
appeared
on
the
previous
week's
log.
so,
any...
any
order
that
reached--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--xxx.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
library
of
congress,
the
issuing
courts,
of
course.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
published
ones
all
wind
up
being
published
in
the
federal
supplement,
and
the
loose-leaf
services
publish
them
in
advance.
there
are
several
loose-leaf
services
that
publish
federal
tax
decisions.
unpublished
decisions,
which
cannot
be
cited
as
precedent,
usually
are
not
included
in
these
publications.
but
they
all
are
available
in
the
clerk's
office
of
the
various
district
courts.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
sooner
really
because--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--there
is
transmittal
time.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
would
be
correct
in...
in
the
categories
of
litigation
where
the
government
is
always
a
party.
but,
of
course,
it's
not
correct
in
many
categories
of
litigation
where
the
government
is
not
a
party
in
all
of
the
cases.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
of
course,
there
is
always
some
burden,
but
part
of
the
burden
of
reading
the
freedom
of
information
act
more
expansively
than
congress
intended
is
that
foia
requests
themselves
that
congress
intended
to
be
honored
will
be
delayed
because
the
limited
number
of
personnel
dealing
with
foia
requests
will
be
distracted--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
do
not
rest
on
it
as
a
separate
legal
point.
i...
i
do
want
to
just
amend
my
answer
to
justice
scalia
and
justice
marshall
by
pointing
out
that
the
department
of
justice
is
not
really
a
repository
where
all
opinions
are
received
in
one
place
either
because
in
many
instances
the
opinions
and
orders
go
to
the
united
states
attorneys'
offices
rather
than
to
the
department
in
washington.
in
tax
cases,
this
is
broken
down
in
a
way
that's
reflected
in
the
record.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
in
this
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
the
logs
do
not
reflect
that.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
let
me,
as
a
preface
to
answering
the
question,
say
we
do
not
think
that
this
case
requires
the
court
to
adopt
an
all-encompassing
definition
that
will
cover
every
kind
of
case.
we
start
off
with
the
notion
that
agency
records
include
records
generated
by
the
agency
which
reflect
the
public
business
or
compiled
by
the
agency
in
a
way
that
is
revealing
about
how
the
agency
is
conducting
its
public
business.
but
it
does
not
include,
for
example,
library
materials
that
are
held
by
the
agency
even
though
those
are
used
in
conducting
the
public
business
and
purchase
pursuant
to
appropriations
of
funds.
we
do
not
think
that
reproducing
those
materials,
becoming
a
library
referral
service,
is
within
the
purpose
of
foia.
and
we
do
not
think
that
records
issued
by
the
courts'
decisions
or
orders
or
materials
issued
by
the
congress
are
part
of
agency
records,
as
we
would
urge
the
court
to
interpret
it
under
foia.
foia
does
not
define
agency
records.
it
does
define
the
agencies
that
are
covered
by
foia,
and
that
definition
excludes
the
courts
and
congress
which
traditionally
have
controlled
the
issuance
and
dissemination
of
their
own
opinions
and
orders.
we
collect--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
we--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--pre-sentence
reports
were
the
ones
given
particular
attention.
and
the
question
was
uncontested.
the
court
noted
that
there
was
no
controversy--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no.
that's
why
i...
i...
i
do
think
we
have
to
be
cautious
about
an
all-encompassing
definition.
the...
the
particular
reason
why
we
concluded
that
pre-sentence
reports
should
be
treated
as
agency
records
is
that
they
were
compiled,
as
the
ninth
circuit
said,
substantially
for
use
by
the
department
of
justice.
they
were
furnished
to
the
bureau
of
prisons
where,
under
department
of
justice
regulations,
they
are
used
in
the
conduct
of
public
business
in
making
work
assignments
for
the
prisoners,
counseling
them,
treating
them,
in
making
decisions
about
security
that's
needed
for
particular
prisoners,
and
they
are
used
in
making
parole
decisions.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
an
analogy
there,
but
it
is...
it
is
used
only
as
a...
the
way
any
litigator
would
use
the
opinion
or
the
way
any
lawyer
would,
to
the
extent
it's
used
as
a
statement
of
what
the
law
is
for
guidance
in
other
cases,
the
same
as
a
reported
case
in
the
department
of
justice's
law
library.
obviously,
the
orders
are
issued
for
compliance
by
the
parties
to
the
case.
but
that
is
a...
a
routine
litigation
use
that
in
no
way
is
different
for
the
department
as
a
litigator
than
for
any
other
litigator.
it's
not
part
of
the
conduct
of
public
business
in
the
same
way
that
administering
the
prisons
would
be.
there's
an
analogy
there,
but
there's
also
an
analogy
to
the
other
reported
decisions
in
the
library.
the...
the
case
falls
in
between.
what
seems
to
us
important
is
that...
and
we
developed
historical
materials
on
this
on
pages
two
and
three
of
our
reply
memorandum
at
the
petition
stage...
traditionally
the
courts
have
controlled
the
dissemination
of
their
own
opinions
and
orders.
clerks'
offices
exist
for
the
very
purpose
of
receiving
filings
and
disseminating
court
opinions
and
orders.
and
the
court
exercises
control
over
that.
and
that
is
not
the
function
of
the
department
of
justice.
if
there
is
a
problem
with
the
dissemination
of
opinions
and
orders
by
the
clerks
of
the
courts,
foia
was
not
intended
to
solve
that,
and
doesn't...
it
isn't
designed
to
solve
that.
the
fit
is
not
good.
there
are
too
many
cases
in
which
the
department
of
justice
or
the
federal
government
is
not
a
party
at
all.
it...
it
can't
really
solve
that
problem
to
turn
from
the
clerks'
offices
to
the
department
of
justice
in
the
cases
where
the
government
happens
to
be
a
party.
and
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
foia
was
designed
to
transfer
that
burden
or
that
function
from
the
clerks'
offices
to
one
of
the
litigators
that
happens
to
be
the
government.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
could
be.
it
might
be
subject
to
a
work
product
or
other
privilege.
there
might
be
an
exemption.
unlike
the
typical
foia
case,
which
involves
a
question
of
what
will
be
disclosed
to
the
general
public
and
what
will
be
held
confidential
to
some
degree,
this
case
involves
publicly
available
documents
that
are
available
at
their
issuing
source.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
a
consideration.
if...
if
what
is
involved
is
a
copyright
problem,
they
might
have
to
at
least
get
a
license
from
the
copyright
holder
and
pay
a
proper
fee.
i
mean--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
we've
never
faced
the
question
whether
that
has
to
be
by
the
agency.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
can't
say
that
i've
consulted
on
that,
that...
that
the
face
of
the
statute
answers
that
particular
problem.
there
was
a
ninth
circuit
decision
called
warth
against
the
department
of
justice,
which
we
have
mentioned,
involving
trial
transcripts
which
court
reporters
do
sell
for
a
fee.
and
the
court
held
that
these
were
not
agency
records.
they're
court
records.
obviously
the
fee
could
be
evaded
if
people
could
get
them
from
the
department
of...
of
justice.
those
are...
are
available
for
a
fee,
but
not
published.
and
we
do
think
that
these
provisions
on
the
face
of
the
act,
excluding
the
obligation
to
produce
in
response
to
a
foia
request
if
the
department
at
least
has
published
the
materials
or
made
them
available
in
a
reading
room,
have
significance
for
this
case
because
if
it's
not
improper
to
withhold
materials
in
that
circumstance,
why
should
it
be
improper
to
withhold
court-generated
materials
that
are
similarly
available
at
their
issuing
source?
if
anything--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--but
it...
well,
there...
it
doesn't
specifically
say
the
other,
but
it
does
say
that...
that
the
department
can
be
ordered
to
produce
only
if
it
is
improperly
withheld
materials.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
court--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
court
held
in
gte
sylvania,
where
no
exemption
was
applicable,
that
it
was
not
an
improper
withholding.
there
there
was
an
injunction
against
the
dissemination
of
the
material
in
a
separate
proceeding.
but
the
court
did
rely
on
that
term
of
the
statute
in
upholding
the
refusal
to
comply
with
the
foia
requests
in
the
face
of
the
injunction.
so,
it
seems
to
me
the
court
has
crossed
that
bridge,
and
it
is
not
necessary
to
adopt
a
very
expansive
view
of
improper
withholding
here.
we
are
talking
about
court-issued
opinions
and
orders
available
to
the
public
in
the
normal
way
from
the
issuing
source
which
is
itself
exempted
from
foia.
we
have
directed
the
requester
to
where
the
materials
are
publicly
available
from
their
normal
source
by
furnishing
copies
of
the
logs.
so,
in
a
sense
there...
there
isn't
withholding
at
all,
let
alone
an
improper
withholding.
and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it's
not
fully
comparable,
but
there
is
an
analogy
which
is
strongly
supported
by
the
fact
that
even
records
generated
by
the
department
themselves,
if
they're
available
in
a
reading
room
or
promptly
published
or
published
in
the
federal
register,
are
not
subject
to
disclosure.
there
is
an
analogy
on
the
face
of
the
statute
in
addition
to
this
term.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
have
to
be
concerned
here
not
merely
with
publishers'
requests,
but
with
requests
of
law
firms,
academic
researchers.
some
of
the
law
firms
may
be
tax
analysts
subscribers.
and,
of
course,
if
we
receive
tax
analysts
publication,
the
lawyers
in
the
department
use
the
analysis
that
tax
analysts
has
furnished.
i
think
that
this
court's
decision
33
days
ago
in
describing
the
purposes
of
foia
and
the
limitations
on
those
purposes
goes
far
toward
providing
the
answer
in
this
case,
the
decision
in
the
reporters
committee
case
involving
rap
sheets.
the
basic
policy
of
foia,
the
court
said,
was
focused
on
the
citizen's
right
to
be
informed
about
what
the
agency
is
doing,
what
the
government
is
up
to,
not
to
receive
information
that
may
be
accumulated
in
the
agency's
files
or
other
resources
that
reflects
what
somebody
else
has
done,
in
that
case
information
about
a
private
citizen.
and
quite
tellingly,
the
court
quoted
with
approval,
among
various
commentators
about
the
act
a...
a
comment
in
the
harvard
civil
rights
and
civil
liberties
law
review
after
saying
that
the
act
was
designed
to
expose
official
conduct
to
public
scrutiny,
and
the
two
sentences
quoted,
with
apparent
approval
by
the
court
from
this
comment,
was
that
no
statement
was
made
in
congress
that
the
act
was
designed
for
a
broader
purpose,
such
as
making
the
government's
collection
of
data
available
to
anyone
who
has
any
socially
useful
purpose
for
it.
for
example,
it
was
never
suggested
that
the
foia
would
be
a
boon
to
academic
researchers
by
eliminating
their
need
to
assemble
on
their
own
data
which
the
government
has
already
collected.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it...
it
does
in
the
sense
that
any
decision
of
the
courts
reflects
whether
the
position
of
the
litigants
are
adopted
or
rejected,
just
as
if
the
court's
decision
said
we
believe
we
have
to
reject
the
government's
position
on
the
authority
of
our
precedent
in
perkins
v.
parker.
perkins
v.
parker
would
shed
light
on
what
the
government
did
in
this
case
and
why
did
it
litigate
this
case
in
the
face
of
perkins
v.
parker.
but
it's...
it's
basically
a
court
document
reflecting
what
the
court
has
done
in
the
case,
and
it's
being
requested
for
that--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
correct.
there
are
research
purposes
for
which
it
can
be
used,
but
it
is
not
being
requested
for
any
purposes
peculiar
to
the
government's
use
of
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
there's
no...
there's
nothing
in
the
way
the
government--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--is
compiling
or
keeping
them
that
sheds
any
light
on
government
business.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
where
properly
applied.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
where
properly
applied,
but
it's
not
to
get
information
that
the
government
has
assembled
that
doesn't
show
what
the
government
is
doing.
