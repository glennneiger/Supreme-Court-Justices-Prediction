justice
o'connor
mr.
wallace,
what
do
you
say
an
agency
record
is
under
foia
as
you
understand
it?
justice
o'connor
well,
how
does
it
include
probation
reports
that
aren't
generated
or
compiled
by
the
agency,
but
nonetheless
relied
on
in
some
sense?
i
guess
we've
said
they're
agency
records.
justice
o'connor
or
pre-sentence
reports.
justice
o'connor
well,
we
indicated
they
appeared
to
be
agency
records.
justice
o'connor
they
were
neither
compiled
by
nor
generated
by
the
agency
itself.
justice
o'connor
mr.
wallace,
what
if...
what
if
the
tax
division
relied...
in
some
sense
it
at
least
reviewed
and
studied
and
considered
a
privately
produced
research
report,
let's
say,
by
some
private
research
organization
that...
from
which
the
public
could
buy
a
copy
of
the
report,
but
a
member
of
the
public
wants
to
see
the
agency's
copy.
could
that
be
an
agency
record?
justice
o'connor
but
you
wouldn't
respond,
i
gather,
that
it's
enough
that
the
member
of
the
public
could
go
buy
it
for
$500
at
the
research
institute
that
produced
it.
justice
o'connor
well,
there's
always
the
expense
of
assembling
and
providing
space
and
filing
and
all
of
that.
it's
more
than
just
copying.
justice
o'connor
mr.
dobrovir,
suppose
that
all
of
the
orders
in
tax
cases
were
also
sent
to,
let's
say,
the
u.s.
tax
court
here
in
washington
and
were
available
there,
and
by
interagency
understanding,
the
department
of
justice
and
the
tax
court
agree
that
any
public
requests
would
go
to
the
tax
court.
is
that
enough?
justice
o'connor
or
you're
still
entitled
to
get
it
from
the
department
that
you
want
to
get
it
from,
no
matter
what.
justice
o'connor
well,
does
it
meet
the
statutory
requirement
in
your
view?
justice
o'connor
now,
why
do
you
say
that
these
are
materials
which
are
not
promptly
published
and
copies
offered
for
sale
under
the
services
of
various
commercial
publishers?
justice
o'connor
uh-hum.
justice
o'connor
but
you
do
have
a
statutory
provision
that
says
if
materials
are
promptly
published
and
copies
offered
for
sale,
it
just
doesn't
apply.
