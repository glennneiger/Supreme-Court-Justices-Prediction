justice
scalia
mr.
wallace,
as
far
as
the
inconvenience
is
concerned,
though,
the
respondents
suggest
that
maybe
that's
the
way
you
do
it
now,
but
it
would
be
no
great
inconvenience
to
simply
instruct
each
attorney
in
the
field
that
when
the
court
opinion
is
issued
and
he
forwards
a
copy
to
wherever
he
now
forwards
it,
another
copy
also
be
sent
to
some
central
repository
where
you
would
have
all
of
them.
would
that
be...
that
seems
plausible
to
me.
is
there
any
reason
that
couldn't
be
done?
justice
scalia
well--
justice
scalia
--maybe
you
win
under
the
statute,
mr.
wallace,
but
i
don't
think
you're
going
to
persuade
me
that
it's
a
whole
lot
of
trouble
to...
to
set
up
some
system
that
would
have
all
these
things
in
one
place
that
they
could
be
turned
over
without...
without
much
difficultly.
justice
scalia
is
that
true
or
not?
i
mean,
is
it
beyond
the
invention
of
the
department
to...
to
have
each
lawyer
who
gets
one
of
these
forward
it
to
a
central
place,
or
when
it
comes
in--
justice
scalia
--or
the
lawyer
who
sends
it--
justice
scalia
that's
the
only
place
they're
available
as
soon
as
they
are
available
in
the
justice
department.
right?
justice
scalia
sooner.
justice
scalia
but
you
have
to
go
around
to
each
one
of
the
courts.
but
the
only
single
place
where
they're
all
present
that
soon
is
the
justice
department.
justice
scalia
don't
you
think
that
description
applies
pretty
well
to
a
court
order
directed
to
the...
or
court
judgment
directed
to
the
department
of
justice?
isn't
that
prepared
for
the
use
and
direction
of
the
department
of
justice?
isn't
it
used
by
the
department
of
justice
to
direct
its
actions
thereafter,
much
more
so
than
a
pre-sentence
report
it
seems
to
me?
justice
scalia
because
the
statute
says
the
one
and
it
doesn't
say
the
other.
isn't
that
a
good
enough
reason?
justice
scalia
oh,
and
you
think
improperly
means
a
general
charge
to
look
into
it
on
the
part
of
the
courts
to
say
what's
improper
and
what
isn't.
justice
scalia
beyond
the
exemptions
that
are
specifically
set
forth.
justice
scalia
is
it
fairly
comparable
that...
to
compare
a
case
where
you
have
a
conflict
between
what
the
statute
says
and
a...
and
a
proper
court
order,
the
court
saying
one
thing--
justice
scalia
--the
statute
the
other?
justice
scalia
or
if
they
dropped
a
copy
in
the
reading
room--
justice
scalia
--one
way
or
the
other,
which
is
what
you
asked.
justice
scalia
don't
give
away
too
much
here
now.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
you
have
a
close
case,
i
mean,
one
that--
--how
about
the
department...
the
department
has
a
data
base
called
lexis,
doesn't
it?
justice
scalia
you
mean...
you
mean
the
agency
couldn't
hire...
couldn't...
couldn't
automatically,
the
way
courts
do,
say
we're
going
to
have
an
official
reporter
of
our
opinions
and
let
that
person
as
a
private
matter
commercially
publish
them
and
offer
them
for
sale?
justice
scalia
gee,
i
thought
that's
precisely
what
that
exemption
was
meant
for?
justice
scalia
so,
why
doesn't
that
cover
f.
supp.--
it
covers--
justice
scalia
--so,
that
would
cover
f.
supp.
i
would
presume.
justice
scalia
but
other
than
copyright,
if
i
buy
your
case,
you're
telling
me
i
have
to...
i
have
to
buy
freedom
of
information
requests
for
f.
supp.
and
i
suppose
a
compendia
of
tax
opinions,
indeed,
your
own
publication.
right?
we...
we
could...
the
justice
department
would
presumably
have
to
respond
to
foia
requests
for
your
own
publication.
justice
scalia
it
has
all
these
opinions
that...
that
govern
the...
the
operation
of
the
agency.
justice
scalia
--i
wish
you
would
say
you
would
or
wouldn't
because
i...
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
adopt
a
principle
that's
going
to
allow
people
to
request
f.
supp.--
why
can't
you
say
that
whether
it's
an
agency...
whether
a
general...
whether
a
reference
work
is
an
agency
record
or
not
can
hinge
upon
whether
the
agency
is
the
only
one
that
has
that
reference
work?
justice
scalia
if
it's
black's
law
dictionary,
it's
not
an
agency
record.
there's
nothing
distinctively
agency
about
it.
but
if
it's
a
reference
work
compiled
by
the
agency,
that
only
the
agency
has
and
nobody
else
does,
it
is.
justice
scalia
that's
irrelevant,
mr.
wallace.
we've
never
held...
no
court
has
ever
held,
as
far
as
i
know,
that
the
purpose
of
the...
in
fact,
that's
what
we
made
clear
in
julian,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
once
again.
justice
scalia
and--
justice
scalia
--that...
that
quote
that
you
read
that
says
there's
nothing
in
the
history
of
the
act
that
indicates
that
one
of
its
purposes
was
to
be
a
boon
to
academic
researchers,
that
may
well
not
have
been
one
of
its
explicit
purposes,
but
you
don't
deny
that
that
has
been
one
of
its
major
effects.
justice
scalia
where
properly
applied.
