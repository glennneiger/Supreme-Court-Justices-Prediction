mr.
wallace?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but,
mr.
wallace--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--mr.
wallace,
how...
how
many,
on
the
average,
opinions
are...
of
the
district
courts
are
we
talking
about
per
year?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
does
the...
do
the
respondents
seek
production
or
access
to
the
ones
that
simply
go
to
the
u.s.
attorneys'
offices?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
dobrovir?
chief
justice
rehnquist
we're
talking
roughly
1,000
a
year.
chief
justice
rehnquist
eighteen
hundred
a
year.
chief
justice
rehnquist
more
properly
understood
by
the
senate
judiciary
committee.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
supposing
the
president
sends
over
a
directive
to
the
department
of
justice
to
do
something.
now,
that
certainly
meets
the
test
of
telling
the
agency
what
to
do.
but
yet,
that
doesn't
become
a
department
of
justice
record,
does
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
then...
then
you're
saying
it
just
includes
a
great
deal
of
what
you
might
call
secondary
records
that
don't
originate
with
the
agency
at
all,
but
just
happen
to
come
to
rest
in
the
agency.
chief
justice
rehnquist

could
say
with
respect
to

supplement
that
in
it,
it
contains
court
decisions
directing
the
department
of
justice
how
to
conduct
itself.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
would
be
the
basis
in
the
statute
for
accepting
that
distinction?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dobrovir.
mr.
wallace,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
the
case
is
submitted.
