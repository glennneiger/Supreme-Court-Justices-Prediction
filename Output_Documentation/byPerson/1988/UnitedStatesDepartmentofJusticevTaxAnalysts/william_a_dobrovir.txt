mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
may
i
first
answer
the
chief
justice's
question
as
to
how
many
orders
and
decisions
are
at
issue
here?
first
of
all,
of
course,
we
are
only
seeking
final
orders
and
decisions
which
conclude
the
case
in
the
district
court.
we
have
not
asked
for
interim
orders
like
discovery
orders.
as
reported
by
the
judicial
conference
of
the
united
states,
over
the
last
five
fiscal
years,
the
average
number
of
orders
and
decisions
terminating
tax
cases
in
the
federal
district
courts
is
1,862.
and
those
figures
are
recited
at
page
three,
footnote
four
of
our
brief.
that
works
out
to
about
36
cases
a
week.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
eighteen
hundred.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
i'd
like
to
put
this
case
in
context.
let's
suppose
that
emily
taxpayer
who
lives
in
montana
has
had
a
deficiency
assessed
against
her,
has
paid
it,
and
decides
to
file
suit
in
the
federal
u.s.
district
court
for
the
district
of
montana.
her
attorney
prepares
and
files
a
complaint
in
the
court,
obtains
a
summons
from
the
court,
and
those,
the
complaint
and
summons,
are
then
served
on
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
and
eventually
wend
their
way
down
to
the
office
of
a...
of
an
attorney
in
the
tax
division.
we...
let's
call
him
bill
barrister.
now,
mr.
barrister
immediately
takes
those
documents
and
opens
an
official
department
of
justice
file
with
them.
it's
called
the
dj
file.
he
reads
the
complaint,
of
course,
sends
a
copy
to
his
counterpart
in
the
chief
counsel's
office
of
the
internal
revenue
service,
and
after
consultation
prepares
an
answer,
which
he
sends
to
montana.
it
is
filed
in
the
court,
and
his
copy
of
the
answer
is
placed
in
the
dj
file.
let
us
suppose
that
both
parties
then
file
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment.
ms.
taxpayer's
attorney
serves
his
on
the...
on
mr.
barrister
and
files
it
in
court.
mr.
barrister
does
the
same
thing.
and
then
finally,
the
judge
issues
his
decision
which
is
filed
in
the
court
and
sent
to
both
taxpayer's
attorney
and
to
barrister,
again
placed
in
the
dj
file.
i
discern
no
distinction,
either
theoretical
or
practical,
among
those
documents.
all
are
filed
in
court,
all
theoretically
available
from
the
clerk,
and
all
are
agency
records
of
the
department
of
justice
by
all
of
the
tests
which
this
court
has...
has--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
--our
experience
has
been
that
at
least
25
percent
of
these
orders
are
never
obtained
by
any
of
the
publishers.
and
there
are
maybe
half
a
dozen
that
are
interested
in
tax
materials.
they're
never
obtained
by
any
of
the
publishers,
and
therefore
are
never...
never
available
in
the
public
domain.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
laziness
is
not
the
issue,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
we...
we
happen
to
be
a
nonprofit
enterprise,
but
others
are
commercial
enterprises.
and
just
the...
the...
the
difficulties
of
getting
these
decisions
have
resulted
in
approximately
25
percent
never
being--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
--xxx
to
the
public.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
take,
for
example,
the
list
is
obtained
by
my
client.
courts
are
telephoned.
the
clerk
says
we
have
the
decision
or
he
says,
well,
i'll
have
to
find
the
decision.
sometimes
a
second
telephone
call
has
to
be
made.
the
clerk
tells
you
how
many
pages
the...
has
to
find
the
decision,
tell
you
how
many
pages
it
has
so
you
can
write
the
check
at
50
cents
a
page.
you
write
the
check.
you
mail
it
to
the
clerk
with
a
letter
asking
for
a
copy
of
the
decision.
sometimes
the
letter
is
delayed
in
the
mail.
sometimes
the
clerk
gets
the
letter
and
sticks
it
in
his
file
because
he's
busy
with
other
things.
sometimes
the
checks
don't
get
cashed,
and
sometimes
the
decisions
simply
don't
arrive.
in
any
event,
it
usually
takes
a
minimum
of
three
to
four
weeks
before
any
publisher
has
obtained
the
decision
which
the
department
of
justice
has
virtually
immediately.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
we
are
prepared...
and
i
am
authorized
to
say
this.
we
are
prepared
to
pay
to
the
department
of
justice
the
same
50
cents
a
page
charge
that
the
courts
charge
if...
if...
because
that...
that
may
well
be
appropriate
under
section
1914
and
the
judicial
conference
order.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
well,
your...
your
honor--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
--it
is
not.
but
to
clarify
something
that...
that
my
brother
wallace
said,
in
the
record
here
in
the
department
of
justice's
answers
to
interrogatories,
the...
this
sentence
appears.
"it
is
normally
the
function
of
the
trial
attorney
to
see
to
it
that
copies
of
decisions
are
sent
to
the
appropriate
district
or
regional
office
of
the
internal
revenue
service.
"
that
is
the
point
at
which,
without
any
particular
extra
work
or
without
spending
more
than
i
suppose
the
extra
three
or
four
seconds
to
run
the
xerox
machine
one
more
time,
the
extra
copy
could
be
made
and
could
be
then
sent
in
the
normal
interoffice
mail
of
the
department
of
justice
to
the
department
of
justice's
press
room
where
all
publishers
have
access,
or
to
the
freedom
of
information
act
reference
room
which
is
maintained
by
the
department
of
justice
which
the
public
can
have
access
to.
there...
the...
i
submit
that
on
that
scenario,
the
expense
would
be
minimal.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
well,
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
first
the
practical
answer.
every
publisher
has
it's
own
tray
in
the
department
of
justice
press
room.
dropping
a
decision
into
the
tray
of
mcgraw-hill
or
the
tray
of
tax
analysts
or
the
tray
of
commerce
clearing
house
in...
where
it
would
sit
with
all
the
press...
the
many
press
releases
and
other
things
that
the
department
of
justice
issues
which
it
wishes
the
press
to
take
and
publish,
would
i
submit
involve
virtually
no
additional
expense.
the
other
answer
is
found
in
the
legislative
history.
in
1981
the
department
of
justice
began
an
effort
to
relieve...
the
executive
branch
represented
by
the
department
of
justice
began
an
effort
to
relieve
itself
of
many
of
the
costs
which
it
argued
were
making
administration
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
prohibitive.
a
number
of
provisions
were
proposed
in...
in
bills
that
were...
some
were...
one
was
introduced
by
senator
hatch
on
his
own.
another
was
introduced
by
senator
hatch
at
the
request
of
the
department
of
justice,
and
that
was
s.
1751
in
the
97th
congress.
that
bill
expressly
referred
to
court
records
as
among
the
records,
public
records,
that
the
agencies
did
not
wish
any...
any
longer
to
be
required
to
produce
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
congress
considered
that.
the
98th
congress
held
hearings
before
the
senate
judiciary
committee,
and
the
senate
judiciary
committee
issued
a
report
in
which
it
stated
that
the
bill
it
was
reporting
did
not
include
the
specific
relief
requested
by
the
executive
branch,
that
is,
a
complete
absolution
from
having
to
produce
public
documents,
including
expressly,
explicitly
court
records
because,
the
senate
judiciary
committee
said,
court
records
and
other
things
such
as
press
clippings
are
not
easily
accessible
except
through
the
government
agencies.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
no.
our
position--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
--our
position
would
not
be
different
because
congress
has
said
that
for
the
reason
that
they
discerned,
which
was
that
documents
are
not
readily
accessible,
they
refused
to
give
the
department
of
justice
the
specific
relief
it
asked...
asked
for
meaning,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
freedom
of
information
act,
as
understood
by
the
congress
and
at
that
time
as
understood
by
the
department
of
justice--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
--senate...
right,
as
understood
by
the
senate
judiciary
committee.
but
i
would
add
that
the...
the
bill
that
the
senate
judiciary...
one
of
the
bills
the
senate
judiciary
committee
reported
out
which
did
not
include
the
relief
the
government...
the
executive
branch
had
asked
for
was
passed
by
the
senate.
it
died
in
the
house,
but
passed
by
the
senate.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
our
position
would
be
the
same.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
our
position
would
be
the
same,
but
we
probably
wouldn't
be
here
at
all.
the
reason...
the
practical
reason
we
are
here
is
because
they
are
not
accessible.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
i--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
--as
a
practical
matter,
that
would
be
enough.
whether
under
the
statute--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
--i
would
say
no.
i
would...
i...
unless...
well,
i
would
say
this,
that
it
might
satisfy
the
provision
that...
that
justice
kennedy
mentioned
earlier,
that
a
document
is
publicly
available
and
offered
for
sale.
the
domb
in
administering
the...
in
issuing
regulations
on
the
1986
amendments
to
the
act
which
dealt
with
the
question
of
cost,
has
indicated
that
it
encourages
departments
to
contract
with
commercial
services
to
make
available
documents
that
it
is
required
to
make
under
the...
make
available
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
and
if
it
had
done
so
in
this
case
and
they
were
promptly
available
for
publication,
i
think
we
probably
would
not
be
here
either.
let
me
turn
to
the
agency
record--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
--yes.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
yes.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
nothing
special
about
the
fact
that
this
is
a
tax
case.
there
are
other
bodies
of
law
which
are
federal
government
law
in
which
the
government
is
always
a
party.
and
i
think
the
principle
we
are
contending
for
here
would
apply
to
every
one
of
those
bodies
of
law.
tax--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
--i
would
have
to
assume
so.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
i
will
say
this
that
tax
law
is
something
that
touches
every
american,
and
i
think
is
of
more
general
importance
and
interest
to
all
americans
than
most
other
areas
of
law
which
have...
which
are
somewhat
more
specialized.
but
i
don't
rely
on
that
either.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
i
don't
rely
on
that,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
let
me
turn
to
the
agency
records
issue.
this
court
has
had
to
deal
with
that
question
with
respect
to
three
kinds
of
documents:
pre-sentence
reports
in
the
case
of
u.s.
v.
crooker
and
u.s.
v.
julian;
consultants'
records
that
the
agency
never
got,
as
in
forsham;
and
white
house
records
that
were
stored
at
the
agency,
but
which
were
never
controlled
or
used
by
the
agency
in
pertinent
part
here,
and
that
was
the
kissinger
case.
the
court
has
looked
to
five
characteristics
in
those
cases
to
determine
what...
whether
the
documents
were
agency
records.
first
of
all,
does
the
agency
possess
them?
secondly,
does
the
agency
freely
control
them,
or
does
some
other
entity
exert
control
over
the
papers
that
the
agency
has?
third,
does
the
agency
use
the
papers
in
the
course
of
its
public
business?
fourth,
does
the
agency
incorporate
the
papers
in
its
own
files?
and
fifth,
do
the
papers
include
information
about
the
agency's
operations?
and
i
suggest
that
if
any...
all
five
of
those
questions
are
asked
with
respect
to
court
records
here,
the
answer
is
yes.
obviously,
the
department
of
justice
tax
division
possesses
them.
obviously,
it
controls
its
copies.
it
sends
copies
to
the
internal
revenue
service.
it
sends
copies
all
around
the
department
of
justice.
when
an...
if
an
appeal
is
to
be...
is
to
be
considered,
copies
go
up
to
the
solicitor
general's
office
in
the
department
of
justice.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
we
are
one
of
those
publishers.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
and
our
experience
based
on
our--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
--the
point
is
they
are
not
promptly
published
or
completely
published
and
offered
for
sale.
as
i
said,
25
percent
of
them
are
missed
by
everybody,
and
a
lot
of
them
are
obtained
only
after
considerable
delay.
so,
i
would
suggest
that
under
those
standards...
under...
under
those
tests,
these
documents
are
not
promptly
published
and
offered
for
sale.
if
the
department
of
justice
were
to
pick
a
chosen
instrument,
for
example,
and
say,
okay,
we
are
going
to
give
you,
publisher
x,
a
copy
of
every
one
of
these
decisions
and
you
can
promptly
offer
them
and
publish
them
for
sale...
publish
them
and
offer
them
for
sale,
and
then
we're
off
the
hook,
that
would
satisfy
that
provision
of
the
statute.
the
department
has
not
done
so.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
which
is
what
we
asked
them
to
do.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
if
they
dropped
a
copy
in
the
reading
room,
that
would
take
care
of
it.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
going
back
through
my
list
of
five
questions,
if
i
may,
both
the
department
of
justice
and
the
internal
revenue
service
use
these
documents
in
their
business.
as
the
agent...
as
the...
as
the...
as
the
petitioner's
brief
admits,
"it
tells
the
agency
how
they
may
act.
"
nothing
could
be
more
involved
than
the
agency's
business
than
an
order
from
the
court
that
tells
it
how
it
may
act.
fourth,
the
department
of
justice
incorporates
the
decisions
into
its
permanent
files,
the
dj
file,
which
is
then
in
turn
subject
to
elaborate
record
keeping,
retrieval
and,
disposal
regulations;
a
regulation
that's
in
the
record
covers
some
160
pages.
and
finally,
it
provides
information
for
the
public
about
agency
operations.
every
one
of
these
decisions
will
at
least
reflect
what
the
agency...
what...
what
the
decision
is.
it
will
reflect
what
the
agency
has
done.
well,
you
don't...
that
isn't
why...
really
why
you
want
the
records...
the
opinions,
though.
you
don't...
you
don't
want
to
learn
anything
about
the
agency.
you
want
to
get
the
opinions
to
find
out
what
the
courts
did.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
insofar
as
we
are
an--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
--insofar
as
we
are
an
agent
for
the
public,
it
is
important
for
the
public
to
know
what,
for
example,
the
internal
revenue
service
does
with
respect
to
taxpayers.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
well,
we
want
them
only...
we
are
really
a
surrogate
for
the
public.
we
take
them...
we
don't
want
them
for
our
own
purposes.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
we
publish
them.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
which
covers
our
costs.
we're
a
nonprofit
organization--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
--justice
white.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
that's
quite
right.
we
have
to
cover
our
costs--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
--i
think
it
would.
i
think
it
would.
once
that
document
is
released
by
the
president,
the...
unless
the
white
house
insists
on
exercising
some
kind
of
control
over
it
and...
and
restricting
its
dissemination.
if
it
did
that
then,
of
course,
there
would
be
another
question.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
well,
the
test
that
this
court
adopted
in
the
forsham
case,
looking
to
the
federal
records
act,
was
documents
that
the
agency
receives
in
the
conduct
of
its
public
business.
those
are
agency
records.
that's
one...
one
test
for
them.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
not
as
such.
no,
by
no
means.
the--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
--well,
each--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
--there's
no
bright
line
test.
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
each
one...
each
kind
of
document
on
its...
on
its
own
facts.
mere
library
books...
well,
for
example,
i
guess
the...
the
easiest
example
for
something
that
isn't
an
agency
record
is
if
the
agency
library
has
a
copy
of
"war
and
peace",
which
agency
lawyers
may
read
in
their
leisure
time.
that
would
not
be,
i
don't
think,
an
agency
record.
other
library
materials
which...
which...
which...
which
are
used--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
--thank
you,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
juris.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
i'm
not
familiar
enough
with
it
except
to
know
that
it
has
a
name.
i
would
give...
the...
an
example
that
i
think
is
more
apt.
the
card
catalog
for
the
department
of
justice
library
probably
would
be
an
agency
record.
among
other
things,
it's
created
by
the
agency.
that
kind
of
makes
it
easier.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
well,
to--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
--i
suppose
a
distinction
can
be
made
that
they
have
no
unique
relationship
to
the
agency.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
well,
they
don't...
in
their...
in
their...
unless,
for
example,
there's...
they've
been
marked
up
and
written
over
by
department
of
justice
attorneys--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
--assuming
there's
nothing
like
that,
they're
not...
they're
not
marked
up
and
therefore
contain
no
particular
input
from
the
department
of
justice--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
--well,
if
they
are,
then
i
think
that's...
they're
more
closely
agency
records,
yes.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
but
if
they're
not
marked--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
--i
would,
yes,
they
are
more...
they
would
be
agency
records
because
they
reflect
the
operations
of
the
agency.
if
they
aren't
marked
up,
then
in
their
pristine,
unmarked-up
form,
they
would
not...
they
would
not
have
any...
they
would
not
reflect
the
operations
or
functions
of
the
agency,
the
test
that
mr.
justice
brennan
mentioned
in
his
dissent
in
forsham
and
which
was
adopted
in
another
context
in
the
reporters
committee
case
that
was
decided
a
little
while
ago.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
that's
right.
they're--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
--they're
also
published
and
available.
and
also,
there...
there
may
well
be
copyright
problems.
the
copyright
act
might
conceivably
be
an
exemption
3
statute.
that
xxx.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
yes,
it
does.
yes,
it
does,
but
in
the
form
in
which
they
are
published
by
the
west...
by
the
west
publishing
company,
they...
they
are
not
in
any
way
unique
to
the
justice
department.
and...
and
that's
the
toughest
case.
i
have
to
admit.
that's...
that...
that...
that
is
one
where,
depending
on
how
they
are
used
by
the
department
of
justice
attorneys,
they
may
very
well...
those
portions
of
those
documents
could
conceivably
be
agency
records.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
they
are
available
for
sale
and
therefore
probably
wouldn't
be...
wouldn't...
wouldn't
be
covered
by
the
freedom
of
information
act.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
well,
the
way
i
read
the
act,
it's
available
for
sale
by
the
agency.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
that's...
that's
right.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
these
opinions
are
available
for
sale
in
another
format
and
in
a
way
that
does
not
relate
them
to
the
business
of
the
justice
department
in
any
particular
manner.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
i
would...
i
would
say...
as
i
said--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
--as
i
said
before,
i
think
that's
what...
that
would
comply
and
omb
has...
has
suggested
that.
i
think
that
would
comply
because
they're
acting
as--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
--because
they're
acting
as
the...
as
the...
as
the
agency's
agent.
the
agency
designates,
as
i
said,
a
chosen
instrument.
it
says
you're
going
to
do
this
for
us,
and
the
publisher
says,
okay,
i'll
do
this
for
you.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
no.
f.
supp....
f.
supp.
isn't
getting
the
decisions
from
the
department
of
justice
at
all.
it
gets
them
i
gather
from
the...
from
the
judges,
and
it
acts
as
nobody's
agent.
it
is
a
publisher
acting
on
its
own
behalf
selling...
selling...
selling
books
to
the
public
at
large.
and
as
i
said,
there
might
well
be
copyright
problems
in
terms
of
exemption
three.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
i
don't
think
so
because
our
publication
isn't
anything
that
within
its
four
corners
is
a
document
that
reflects
the
operations
and
functions
of
the
agency.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
and
a
lot
of
other...
and
a
lot
of
other
material
as
well.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
well,
of
course,
it
does.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
of
course,
it
does.
and
as
i
said,
there's
no
bright
line
test
here.
right
now,
of
course,
i
would...
i
would...
i
would...
i
would
retreat
to
the...
to
the...
to
the
lawyer's
last
refuge
which
is
that
isn't
this
case.
this
case
we're
dealing
with
documents
that
are,
in
fact,
incorporated
in
the
department
of
justice's
files,
and
i
think
that
would
be
another...
another
distinction
between
the
books
on
the
library
shelves
and
the
documents
we're
dealing
with
here.
the
books
on
the
library
shelves
are
not
incorporated
in
the
department
of
justice's
files.
they
are
not
punched
and
stamped
and
placed
in
a
dj
file
and
passed
around
the
department
for...
for
use
in
the
particular...
in
the
particular
situation
in
which
they
are...
in
which
the
department
of
justice
is
using
them.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
not
to
my
knowledge,
justice
marshall.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
i
do
not
believe
that
the
department...
that
the
library
of
congress
obtains
from
anywhere
the
initial
edition
of
the
issuance
of
the...
the
copy
of
the
opinion
as
issued
by
the
court.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
it
gets
fed.
supp.
like
everyone
else.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
well,
they
have
fed.
supp.,
and
presumably
they'll
have
cch--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
--and
prentice
hall,
but
they
won't
get
the
opinions
in
the
format
in
which
we
are
asking
for
them.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
that's
right.
i
don't
know.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
i'm
sure
they
are.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
not--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
--they're
not
using
prentice-hall
in
the
same
way
that
they're
using
the
decisions
when
they
get
them
and
before
they
appear
in
prentice-hall
some
two
or
three
months
down
the
road.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
he
also
looks
at
the
decision
that
his
friend,
mr.
barrister,
down
the
hall
just
handed
him
a
copy
of
saying--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
--look
what
the
district
court
is
doing
here.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
that's
the
decision
we
want--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
--not
the
prentice-hall
decision.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
what
if
we
did
want
prentice-hall?
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
well,
there...
there
is
sort
of
a
practical
reason
why.
i
mean,
the
law...
the
law
doesn't
deal
with
trifles,
but
it
also
should
not
deal
with
absurdities.
i
think
it's
unlikely
in
the
extreme
that
any--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
--it's
unlikely
that
anyone
would
go
to
the
justice
department
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
to
try
to
get
a
copy
of
something
out
of
the
federal
supplement,
wait
10
days
and
pay
10
cents
a
page.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
i'm
not
saying
we
would,
and
i'm
not
saying
we
wouldn't.
it
would
depend
on
a
lot
of
facts
that...
that
aren't
involved
in
this
case
here.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
i
think
that--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
--i
would
agree
with
that.
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
there
isn't
any
basis
in
the
statute
because
the
statute
doesn't
define
agency
record.
this
court
has
to
define
agency
record.
and
i
think
it
can
define
it
in
the
way
that
justice
scalia...
justice
scalia
mentioned.
let
me
quickly
talk
about
the
gte
v.
sylvania
case
and
improperly
withheld.
our
position
is
that
except
with...
with
the
very
narrow
exception
of
documents
that
the
agency
cannot
produce
either
because
there
is
a
court
order
or,
for
example,
because
it
has
been
destroyed,
improperly
withheld
means
any
withholding
that
is
not
countenanced
by
one
of
the
nine
exemptions.
gte
sylvania
talks
about
the
fact
that
the
agency
has
no
discretion...
had
no
discretion
in
the
matter.
it
was
not
the
agency's
decision
to
withhold.
in
effect,
the...
the...
the
question
of
withholding
or
not
had
been
taken
out
of
the
agency's
hands
entirely
by
the
federal
district
court
in
delaware.
that
is,
therefore...
and
as
this
court
said,
the
concerns...
the
concerns
congress
had
in
passing
the
freedom
of
information
act,
to
wit,
to...
to
curb
unbridled
agency
discretion,
were
not
present
in
gte
sylvania
because
the
agency
had
no
discretion
to
exercise
at
all.
a
similar
case
would
be
if,
unfortunately,
documents
that
were
agency
records
happened
to
have
been
burned
up
in
a
fire.
there
is
no
discretion.
the
agency
can't
withhold
or
not
withhold.
it's
physically
impossible.
and--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
--they--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
--well,
we
say,
of
course,
that
the
decision
itself
is
an
agency
record
because
of
the
way
it
is
received
and
the
way
it
is
used.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
no,
but
as
forsham...
forsham
and
kissinger
indicate
be...
simply
being
created
by
the
agency
is
not
the
only
test.
my
time
has
expired.
