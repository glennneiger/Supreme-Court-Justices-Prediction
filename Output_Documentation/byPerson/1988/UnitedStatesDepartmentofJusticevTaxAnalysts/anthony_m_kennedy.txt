justice
kennedy
--is
the
point
of
all
this
that
they
are
not
agency
records?
justice
kennedy
well,
but
i
mean
is...
is
that
the
point
you're
leading
up
to,
or
is
this
just
background
recitation?
what
does
it
have
to
do
with
the
statute?
justice
kennedy
interim
order,
discovery
orders?
what
kind
of
orders?
justice
kennedy
well,
is
that...
is
that
the
meaning
of
the
statute
in
which
it
says
that
unless
the
materials
are
promptly
published
and
copies
offered
for
sale?
does
that
have
to
be
by
the
agency?
justice
kennedy
do
you
have
a
position
on
that?
justice
kennedy
what
is
the
statutory
point
that
this
bears
on
this?
suppose
the
fact
were
that
these
documents
were
readily
available
from
courts
all
over
the
country.
would
your
position
be
any
different?
justice
kennedy
so,
why
are
we
talking
about
it?
justice
kennedy
but
even
if
the
fact
were
that
you
could
get
these
from
district
courts
all
over
the
country
within,
say,
a
five-day
turnaround
time,
your
position
here
would
still
be
the
same--
justice
kennedy
--that
you're
entitled
to
them
from
the
department
of
justice.
justice
kennedy
but
i...
i
thought
that's
the
whole
reason
why
you
wanted
it.
the
only
reason
you
want
this
is
because
it
shows
the
operations
of
the
department.
now,
you
can't
say
that
once
it's
published,
it
doesn't
reflect
the
operation
of
the
department.
justice
kennedy
that
just
eats
up
your
case.
justice
kennedy
is
it
your
position
that
responding
to
the
request
would
not
shed
any
light
on
the
conduct
of
the
government
agency?
