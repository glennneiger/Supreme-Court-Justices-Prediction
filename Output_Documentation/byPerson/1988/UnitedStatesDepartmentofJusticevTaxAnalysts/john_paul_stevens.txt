mr.
wallace,
may
i
just
ask
you
one
other
question
about
your
burden
argument?
isn't
there
always
some
burden
on
the
government
in
complying
with
an
foia
request?
and
if...
if
there
is,
how
does
this
burden...
what...
what
is
our
rule
for
deciding
when
a
burden
is
significant
enough
to
be
taken
into
consideration?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
if
the
request
is...
is
broader
than
congress
intended,
we'd
deny
it
even
if
there
was
no
burden
involved.
justice
stevens
i'm
just
wondering
if
there
really
is
any
legal
merit
to
your
burden
argument.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
other
practical...
is
your
problem...
i
mean,
i
understand
you
represent
a
tax
service,
but
wouldn't...
wouldn't
the
same
issue
be
presented
in
all
sorts
of
other
specialized
areas
of
the
law,
such
as
social
security
or
antitrust
or
criminal
law,
that...
that
the
services
could
more
conveniently
get
them
from
a
centralized
place
and
expedite
their
work?
justice
stevens
maybe
that's
good.
i'm
not--
justice
stevens
--but
there's
really
nothing
special
about
the
fact
this
is
a
tax
case.
justice
stevens
and
presumably
there's
the
same
difficulty
in
getting
all
the
opinions
as
promptly
as
you
wanted
them.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
i
think
specialists
in
other
areas
of
the
law
might
disagree.
[laughter]
justice
stevens
yes,
yes.
justice
stevens
let
me
go
back
to
the
contents
of
the
library
a
minute.
i
agree
that
"war
and
peace"
probably
isn't
if
it's
for
leisure
reading.
but
what
about
library
materials
that
are
accumulated
to
help
the
agency
conduct
its
regular
business:
law
reviews,
opinions
of
state
courts,
tax
materials
and
all
that
sort
of
stuff?
justice
stevens
that
would
be
just
like
this,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
using
your
five
factor
formula
and...
and
in
trying
to
get
a
workable
definition,
can
you
give
us
a
definition
that
would
exclude
those
and
include
what
you
want?
justice
stevens
doing
their
regular...
they
may
have
a
privacy
exemption
or
something
like
that,
but
assume
there's
no
exemption
applicable.
justice
stevens
well,
i
think
they
would
be
even
better
if
they
were
marked
up.
then
it
would
be
a
stronger
case.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
oh,
i
see.
i'm
with
you.
justice
stevens
--well,
let
me
make
sure
i
understand
your
position
on
available
for
sale.
do
you
read
that
as
applying
to
available
for
sale
by
anyone
or
available
for
sale
by
the
agency
that
you're
making
the
demand
on?
justice
stevens
yes.
well,
then
these
others...
that's
no
answer
to
all
these
other
examples
then--
justice
stevens
--because
these
opinions
are
available
for
sale
just
as
the
fed.
supplement
is
available
for
sale.
