mr.
richard
david
emery
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
essence,
the
city
makes
a
claim
to
an
exemption
in
this
case,
an
exemption
from
the
court's
well-established
rule
that
elected
municipal
governing
bodies
must
be
distracted
by
population.
without
ever
having
made
any
good
faith
effort
to
reapportion
or
establish
a...
establish
a
scheme
on
the
basis
of
population--
mr.
richard
david
emery
--yes.
well,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
it...
it
is
in
fact...
it
does,
in
fact,
have
substantial
legislative
powers
if
not
in
law,
in
fact.
but
the
closest
cases
of
this
court
are
clearly
avery
v.
midland
county
which
was
a
commissioners'
court
in
texas
and
which...
in
which
there
were
four
representatives,
one
of...
and
one
of
whom
was
at
large...
and
a
fifth
that
was
at
large.
and
this
court
did
not
take
into
account
the
at-large
representation.
mr.
richard
david
emery
yes.
and
this,
in
effect,
is
the
governing
body
of
new
york
city
for
all
financial
matters.
mr.
richard
david
emery
well,
this
court
has
announced
the
doctrine
of
special
purpose
bodies,
and
they
are
bodies
with
limited
franchise.
generally
speaking,
to
date
at
least,
this
court
has
held
that
the
one
person/one
vote
rule
applies
to
municipalities
where
there
is
a
general
governmental
activity
and
there
is
a...
a
general
franchise.
the
basis
of
that
rule
is
the
general
franchise,
and
this
court's
fundamental
doctrine
that
every
voter
is
entitled
to
participate
equally
in
the
elective
process.
it's
an
individual
right.
it's
not
a
majoritarian
right
in
this
context.
and
as
such,
yes,
it
is
true
that
certain
bodies
may
be
accepted
if
they
are
special
purpose
bodies
with
limited
franchise
for
specific
issues
or
for
affecting
specific
people
in
a...
in
a
geographic
area.
but
the
reality
is
that
where
there
is
a
general
franchise,
this
court
has
uniformly
held
that
where
governing
powers
are
involved,
limited
to
the
point
of
a
school
board
in
hadley
v....
in
the
hadley
case,
those
cases
make
it
clear
that
general
governing
bodies
with
a
general
franchise
are
under
the
one
person/one
vote
principle.
now,
the
point
here
is
that
mr.
zimroth
argues
for
new
york
as
some
kind
of
unique,
special
situation.
that
is
simply
not
the
case.
in
the
united
states
of
the
20...
of
the
municipalities
that
have
populations
over
2,500,
25...
20
percent
of
them
have
mixed
at-large
district
schemes
akin
to
the
board
of
estimate.
of
the...
of
the
city...
13
of
the
largest--
mr.
richard
david
emery
--excuse
me?
mr.
richard
david
emery
it
is
for
city
councils,
but
those
city
councils
handle
virtually
all
of
exactly
the
same
powers
of
the
board
of
estimate
plus
some
more.
mr.
richard
david
emery
clearly
a
city
can
split
off
some
functions
from
the
city
council
and
not
be
governed
by
one
person/one
vote
as
long
as
those
functions
are
limited.
i
think
that
a
contract
function,
for
instance,
could
be
given
to
a
contract
board
and
that
would
not
have
to
be
elected
and,
therefore,
it
could
be
limited.
but
the
board
of
estimate,
you
must
understand,
passes
as
a
co-equal
branch
of
new
york's
legislature
on
the
$25
billion
budget
every
year.
it
implements
that
budget
by
letting
$5
billion
a
year
in
contracts.
it
is
closer
to
the
people,
the
citizens,
of
new
york
city
than
any
other
governing
body,
much
closer
to
the
citizens
of
new
york
city
than
the
city
council.
it
determines
all...
how
all
property
is
developed.
it
determines
the
use
of
all
city
property.
it
places
jails.
it
places
homeless
shelters.
it
places
garbage
dumps,
incineration
plants.
every
major
issue
in
new
york
city
reaches
the
board
of
estimate.
mr.
richard
david
emery
well,
there
is--
mr.
richard
david
emery
--no.
well,
you
see,
there
are
routine...
there
are
routine
issues
that
come
before
the
board
of
estimate.
every
time
a
sidewalk
cafe
wants
to
put
a
little
extension
on
its
sidewalk
cafe
portion,
it
has
to
go
to
the
board
of
estimate
and
get
signed
off.
i
mean,
i
suppose...
i'm
not
sure,
but
i
suppose
it's
a
little
bit
like
certiorari
petitions
in
this
court.
there
is
an
enormous
amount
of
unanimity
on
the
board
of
estimate
for
routine
discussion
matters.
but
the
board
of
estimate's
real
role
in
the
city,
as
mr.
zimroth
has
argued...
and
i
think
he
has
argued
it
here
today...
and
concedes,
is
the
determination
of
the
difficult
financial
issues
about
the
city's
future,
about
how
it's--
mr.
richard
david
emery
--yes.
mr.
richard
david
emery
they
disagree
all
the
time.
it's
impossible
to...
to
statistically
analyze
it
because
the
board
of
estimate
votes
are
hand-counted.
they
don't
even
publish
them.
you'd
have
to
go
back
to
the
newspaper
records.
but,
in
fact,
there
are
a
number
of
disagreements
which
are
very,
very
significant.
there
were
three
six
to
five
votes
recently
where
the
borough
presidents
disagreed
and
where
the
at-large
members
disagreed
and
were
staten
island
weighted
by
virtue
of
population,
those
votes
on...
on
a
incineration
plant,
on
homeless
shelters,
and
on
middle
income
housing
in
the
bronx,
all
would
have
gone
the
other
way.
they
all
would
have
been
the
opposite
result
had
there...
had
there
been
a
weighting
by
vote.
most--
mr.
richard
david
emery
--well,
mr.--
mr.
richard
david
emery
--mr.
zimroth's
34...
page
34
is
a
bit
of
a
red
berring,
i
might
say,
because
this
34,
page
34
system,
redesigns
the
entire
system.
in
the
system
now,
with
the
six
to
five
majority
needed,
you
need
two
city-wide
and
two
borough
presidents.
if
you
look
at
this
system,
you
need
two
city-wide
and
one
borough
president.
this
system
gives
the
borough
presidents
far
more
power
than
they
have
today.
so,
i
mean,
this
system
is
a
little...
this...
this
would
be
a
radical
change
of
the
relative
powers
of
the
people
who
sit
on
the
board
of
estimate
as
we
know
it
today.
mr.
richard
david
emery
no,
in
fact,
i
don't...
i
don't
know
whether
it
would
be
unconstitutional,
and
this...
this
is
the
reason
because
under
this
court's
case
law,
the
critical
criteria
is
the
equal
right
of
a
voter
to
participate
in
an
election.
this
system
does
provide
the
equal
right
of
a
voter
to
participate
in
an
election.
but
it's
a
sham.
the
system
is
a
sham
to
create
equal
rights
among
borough
presidents.
and
there
might
be
some
other
basis
to
attack
it.
i
can't
think
it's...
i
don't
think
it's
permissible
under
the
state
constitution.
i
think
clearly
the
state
constitution
would
hold
this
system
absolutely
unconstitutional.
mr.
richard
david
emery
oh,
absolutely.
this
case...
this
court
affirmed
a
case
in
1971
i
believe
it
was.
it
was
called
franklin
v.
krause.
it
came
out
of
nassau
county,
and
it
was
a
weighted
voting
scheme
for
the
county
legislature
where
they
have
different
towns
of
radically
different
sizes,
and
the...
the
mayor
on
the
executive
of
each
town,
just
by
virtue
of
his
office,
appointed
to
the
county
legislature
and
assigned
a
weighted
vote
based
on
the
population
of...
of
that
which
he...
of
that
town
which
he
represents.
and
those
weighted
votes
are
calculated.
so,
they
are
meaningful
representation
because
they
are
determined
in
conjunction
with
the
power
not
the
representation,
but
the
power
of
that
person
to...
to
effect
a
change,
to
effect
a
critical
vote
on
the
legislative
body.
consequently,
this...
this
court
has
summarily
affirmed
a
system
that
was
adopted
by
a
state
deferring
obviously
to
the
state
system
in
franklin
v.
krause,
a
system
which
this
board
of
estimate
could
clearly
and
easily
adopt
at
any
point
it
wished
and
guarantee
meaningful
representation,
representation
consistent
with
the
amount
of
population
in
staten
island
and
the
bronx
and
all
the
way
down
the
line
for...
for
the...
for
purposes
of
perpetuating
the
board
of
estimate
in
exactly
the
way
it
looks
now,
but
with
votes
that
are
apportioned
appropriate
to
population.
the...
the
point
about
the
allocation
is
i
think
a
very
important
one.
it's
in
some
ways
central
here,
and
that
is
does
the
presence
of
the
city-wide
officials
in
any
way
mitigate
the
drastic
deviations
of
equal
representation
for
two
boroughs,
such
as
staten
island
at
350,000
and
brooklyn
at
2.2
million.
well,
i
say
that
we
win
under
any
method
of
locking
at
it,
whether
you
allocate
it
in
the
way
that
justice
o'connor
was
suggesting
before,
or
whether
you
don't
allocate
it
as
the...
as
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
allocate
it.
and
that...
the
reason
they
did
not
allocate
it
makes
sense
although
we
do
not
rely
on
those
reasons
in
order
to
win
here.
this
is
a
two-tier
body,
representational
body.
it
has
city-wide
representation,
and
it
has
community
borough
local
representation.
the
city
has
argued
that
over
and
over
again.
staten
island
has,
in
fact,
come
in
here...
come
to
this
court
and
put
in
affidavits,
the
lamberti
affidavit
in
the
record
and
the
trautmann
affidavit
in
the
record.
and
they
say
they
have
preserved
their
suburban
wonderful
way
of
life
in
staten
island
by
virtue
of
the
equal
vote
that
they
have.
they
are
argued
that
in
this
court
as
the
reason
for
sustaining
the
equal
vote,
the
point
being
that
it
is
a
two-tier
legislative
body.
those
two-tier
representational
system
is
the
basis
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
said
you've
got
to
measure
them
separately.
but
more
important
even
than
what
the
court
of
appeals
said,
the
logic
of
the
system
is
very
clear.
when
the
city-wide
officials
want
to
go
out
and
form
a
coalition
to
gain
a
majority
on
any
given
issue
on
which
they
have
taken
the
initiative...
and
usually
they
do
take
the
initiative
because
they're
the
mayor,
and
they're
the
city
council
president,
and
they're
the
comptroller.
but
when
they
go
out
and
try
and
create
a
coalition,
there's
no
premium
on
getting
the
vote
of
brooklyn
of
queens
where
the
major
population
is.
there
is
no
premium
at
all.
in
fact,
the
tendency
will
be
to
go
get
the
vote
of
staten
island
because
it's
easier
to
get
the
vote
of
the
staten
island
borough
president.
you
only
have
to
satisfy
the
needs
of
a
homogenous
350,000-person
borough
as
opposed
to
the
needs
of
a
2.2
million
borough
or
a
1.8
million
borough.
mr.
richard
david
emery
uh-hum.
mr.
richard
david
emery
oh,
well,
it's
enormous
and
dramatic
by
any
calculation.
mr.
richard
david
emery
exactly?
mr.
richard
david
emery
well,
that's...
that
is
the...
i
view
that
as
one
of
the
central
questions
in
the
case.
and
what
i'm
saying
is
that
by
any
measure,
even
if
you
do
allocate
them...
and
we
did
do
that.
we
were
the
ones
who
offered
the
allocation.
we
didn't
back
off
it.
our
expert
backed
off
it,
and
it
came
to
78
percent
when
you
allocated
that
way.
but
to
answer
your
question
clearly,
if
you
get
in
the
voting
booth
and
you're
the
voter,
and
you
vote
for
the
mayor,
the
city
council
president
and
the
comptroller,
all
those
votes
that
you've
just
cast
you
have
an
equal
right
to
participate
with
everybody
else
in
the...
in
the
city
in
voting
for
those
officials.
but
when
you
vote
for
your
borough
president,
you
don't
have
an
equal
right
to
participate
with
somebody
across
the
harbor
in
staten
island.
you
don't
have
a...
equal
access
to
that
person.
you
don't
have
equal
leverage
over
that
person.
you
don't
have
equal
responsiveness
form
that
person.
you're
competing
with
2.2
million
other
people
if
you
live
in
brooklyn,
1.8
million
other
people
if
you're
in
queens.
in
staten
island,
you're
competing
only
with
350,000
other
people.
mr.
richard
david
emery
right.
mr.
richard
david
emery
and
that
point...
again,
i
don't
want
to
overly
defend
the
court
of
appeals
because
by
any
measure
we
win
it.
seventy-eight
percent
is
far
above
anything
this
court
has
ever
tolerated.
and
what
i...
what
i...
but
put
that
aside.
to
answer
your
question,
the
point
is
that
when
a
governmental
decision
is
made
above
and
aside
from
the
premium
issue,
the
city-wide
officials
make
their
decisions
based
on
their
view
of
city-wide
interests.
they
don't
have
to
win
the
borough
elections.
it's
not
like
a
presidential
election
where
there
are
states
and
you
have
to
compile
up
each
borough
victory.
their
coalitions
for
their
constituency
are
comprised
of
city-wide
coalitions,
racial,
ethnic,
socioeconomic,
whatever.
and
those
determine,
theoretically
at
least,
what
the
city-wide
official's
interest
is.
and
it's
a
city-wide
interest.
the
same
cannot
be
said
for
the
borough
presidents.
the
borough
presidents'
issues
are
determined...
their
point
of
view,
their
vote,
their
actions
as
public
officials
are
determined
by
the
view
of
their
constituency
which
are
of
dramatically
different
sizes.
and
these
are
very
real
decisions,
and
they
make
very
real
differences.
and
in
the
record
at
least,
it's
very
clear
that
there
are...
there
is
evidence...
there
is
some
certainly
evidence
of...
of
some
dramatic
differences
in
the
way
that
people
perceive
their
borough
presidents
and
their
responsiveness
in
the
different
boroughs.
mr.
richard
david
emery
well,
in
fact--
mr.
richard
david
emery
--the...
the
history
of
the...
of
the
consolidation
of
new
york
city,
as
mr.
zimroth
has
provided
to
you,
is
a
bit
of
a
mythology.
we
provided
the
history,
the
correct
history,
in
the
brief,
plus
the
lodging
material
has
it
extensively.
staten
island
would
do...
would
have
done
anything
to
become
part
of
new
york
city.
they
wanted
to
grab
at
the
huge
tax
base
of
manhattan
and
brooklyn.
they...
they
overwhelmingly
voted
in
straw
polls,
which
were
not
binding.
it
wasn't
a
binding
vote
to...
to
do
this.
mr.
richard
david
emery
well,
i...
i
overstate
it
because
every
other
municipality,
every
other
city
including
washington,
d.c.,
that
has
a
mixed
district
and
at-large
system
complies
with
one
person/one
vote.
all
the
districts
are
substantially
equal.
they
have
their
own
peculiar
geographic,
historical
and
other...
socioeconomic,
political,
unique
qualities
in
history
and
in
development
and
in
the
way
that
they've
come
to
have
the
political
system
they
have.
they're
no
more
or
less
unique
than
new
york.
but
each
one
of
those
cities,
every
single
one...
new
york
is
the
sole
exception
that
anyone
knows
of.
we
can
ask
mr.
zimroth
if
there
are
any
others,
but
i
think
for
the
25
years
that
this
court
has
required
municipalities
to
comply
with
the
simple
dictates
of
the
arithmetic
computation
for
substantially
equal
districts,
that--
mr.
richard
david
emery
--rule
has
been
extremely
successful
because
every
single
city,
every
municipality
has
compiled
with
it.
if
there
is
some
other
rule
announced
after
the
1990
census
when
redistricting
is
going
to
be
very
uncomfortable
for
everybody
involved,
there
will
be
all
kinds
of
new
claims
to
the
historic,
geographic,
socioeconomic
and
other
factors
which
are
going
to
attempt
to
skew
reapportionment
in
the
direction
of
either
incumbency
or
in
directions
that
we
cannot
foretell.
mr.
richard
david
emery
so,
i
think
that--
mr.
richard
david
emery
--i
mean...
another
city
that
has
boroughs.
i
believe
there's
a--
mr.
richard
david
emery
--borough
presidents.
well,
borough
presidents
are
name--
mr.
richard
david
emery
--i'm
saying
that
district
at-large
schemes
are
common.
none
of
them
violate
one
person/one
vote.
mr.
richard
david
emery
well,
i
think
dusch
v.
davis.
mr.
richard
david
emery
well,
i
think
the
only
one
that
is
in
any
sense
similar
is
the
virginia
beach
case
that
came
out
of
here.
there
was...
there
were
boroughs
in
virginia
beach.
there
are
cities
with
boroughs
in
the
united
states.
mr.
richard
david
emery
i
don't
know
any
off
the
top
of
my
head.
mr.
richard
david
emery
well,
boroughs...
i
mean,
what
are
boroughs
anymore?
boroughs
are
not
governmental
units
of
any
type.
boroughs
are
simply
administrative
districts
for
a
very
strong
centralized
new
york
city.
mr.
richard
david
emery
well,
are
they
within
a
county
and
they
comprise
a
county?
or...
i
don't
know
the
pennsylvania
scheme.
mr.
richard
david
emery
they're
towns.
well,
you
see,
new
york
has
a
system
which
is
very
analogous
in
the
counties.
as
i've
said
before,
in
franklin
v.
krause,
this
court
upheld
the
system
where
you
had
the
town
officials
elected
to
a
county
legislature.
justice
marshall
wrote
the
opinion
in...
in
abate
v.
fundt
about
the
county
of
rockland
where
by
definition,
becoming
the
town
supervisor
puts
you
on
the
county
legislature
which
then
acts
as
a
legislative
body.
in
abate
v.
fundt,
the
11.9
percent
deviation
was
found
tolerable
by
justice
marshall
and
for
the
court.
and
that...
that
was
such
a
system.
and
what
they
had
there
was
a
multi-member
system
to
accommodate
for
the
hugely
disparate
populations
within
these
towns...
within
these
towns
which
comprised
the
county.
so,
there
are
systems
which
are
very...
that
are
analogous
i
would
say.
the
difficulty
here
is
that
this...
this
case
presents
two
things
together,
each
of
which
is
fairly
common,
but
both
of
which
are
fairly
rare,
and
that
is
a
mixed
at-large
and
district
system
and
a...
a
system
of...
of,
as
you
put
it...
of...
of...
where
there
are
substantial
at-large
numbers
and
a
system
where
components
comprise
an
overall
legislative
scheme.
the...
i
think
in
fact
the...
the
notion
that
there
is
unanimity--
mr.
richard
david
emery
--excuse
me.
mr.
richard
david
emery
well--
mr.
richard
david
emery
--there's--
mr.
richard
david
emery
--would
i?
i
think
that's
something
for
the
court
at
the
remedy
stage.
i
think
that
it
is
certainly
constitutional.
it
is
certainly
a
constitutional
system
under
one
person/one
vote.
your
opinion
in...
in
avery
v.
midland
county
for
the
court
stated
as
such,
that
the
flexibility
of...
of...
within
the
one
person/one
vote
rule
was
the...
was...
was
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
the
case
in
virginia
beach,
dusch
v.
davis,
was
allowed
to
go
forward
because
it
was
a
totally
at-large
scheme.
i
might
say
that
this
mixed
district
and
at-large
scheme,
which
we've
talked
about
as
relatively
popular
in
the
united
states
right
now,
is
a
scheme
which
is
growing
in
popularity.
in
fact,
it's...
this
mixture
of
at-large
and
district
schemes
is
something
that
is
completely
desirable.
the
only
thing
that
the
plaintiffs
object
to
in
this
case
is
the
assignment
of
equal
votes
for
each
of
the
boroughs
within
this
scheme
instead
of
assignment
for
equal
opportunity
to
participate
in
the
electoral
process
by
the...
by
the
voters.
and
the
interesting
thing
is
here...
and
we
can
ask
mr.
zimroth
this.
i
mean,
you
can
ask
mr.
zimroth
this
in
rebuttal,
and
that
is
what
interests
that
he
has
cited
for
upholding
the
current
board
of
estimate...
and
he
has
cited
many
interests.
he
cited
interests
in
history,
in
natural
boundaries
and
integrity
of
subdivisions,
in
effectiveness,
in
meaningful
participation,
in
check
on
executive
powers,
what,
if
any
interests
of
those
in
retaining
the
current
board
of
estimate
in
any
way
relate
to
the
retention
of
equal
votes
for
the
borough
presidents?
mr.
richard
david
emery
well,
the...
the--
[laughter]
the
representative
from
staten
island
can
have
one
vote,
and
the
representative
from
brooklyn
can
have
six
votes,
or
it
can
be
apportioned
in
such
a
way
that
the
staten
island
representative
will
come
to
the
meetings
because
he
will
make
a
meaningful
difference.
and
it...
i
guess
the...
the
opposite
of
your
hypothetical
is
let's
say
we
wanted
to
give
staten
island
and
absolutely
guaranteed
role
in
the
system.
why
not
have
total
at-large
elections
and
give
every
staten
islander
six
votes;
every
brooklyner;
one,
every
queens,
two;
every
bronx,
three...
manhattan,
three;
and
bronx,
four?
could
we
do
that?
it
seems
to
me
that
would
be
plainly
unconstitutional
and
that
is
the
exact
import
of
the
system
that
now
is
in
existence.
the
point
about
the...
about
the
justifications
that
mr.
zimroth
offers
here
is
that
none
of
them
support
this
equal
vote
for
boroughs.
and,
in
fact,
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
the
equal
votes
for
boroughs
is
a
relatively
new
part
of
this
scheme.
this
scheme,
for
60
of
its
90
years,
did
have
votes
roughly
weighted
for
purposes
of
population.
and
in
1958
when
they
equalized
the
votes,
the
deviations
went
up
substantially...
population
deviations
under
the
abate
method.
the...
justice
o'connor
asked
whether
it
would
make
a
difference
whether
an
at-large
representative
was
added.
well,
you
can
figure
approximately.
i
can't
do
it
because
i
don't
have
the
calculator
ready,
but
basically
it's
132.9
percent
if
you
ignore
the
city-wide.
it's
78
percent
if
you
add
the
city-wide.
and
that's
three
of
them.
so,
if
the
difference
between
70...
100...
is
about...
40
plus
twenty
is
60.
sixty
percentage
points
are
added
by
three...
or
sorry...
lowered
by
addition
of
three.
so,
four
would
probably
bring
it
down
to
58
percent.
in
fact,
this
court...
this
court
has
summarily
affirmed
the
invalidation
of
a
city
council
scheme
in
new
york
city
that
had
50.8
percent
deviations.
and
that
city
council
scheme
had
essentially
exactly
the
same
interests
underlying
it
as
the
board
of
estimate
scheme.
in
that
scheme
each
borough
had
two
extra
city
council
seats
assigned
to
the
borough
as
borough
representatives.
this
court
summarily
affirmed
in
andrews
v.
koch,
which
is
in
the
brief,
the...
the
invalidation
of
that
scheme
which
assigned
equal...
equal...
two
votes/two
new
city
council
each
for
each
borough.
and
the
justifications
there
were
actually
stronger
because
there
was
an
added
justification
that
the...
there
would
be
a
minority
party
representative
on
each
of
those...
one
of
the
two
would
have
to
be
a
minority
party
representative.
it
could
not
be
a
democrat.
it
would
have
to
be
some
other
party
in
the
city
of
new
york.
and
the...
that
was
thought
to
be
a
good
thing,
and
that
was
offered
as
a
justification
for...
an
added
justification
besides
the
equal
participation
of
the
boroughs.
so,
what
we
have
here
in
the
end...
and
one
should
be
aware
of
this...
is
many
alternatives
that
can
work
for
new
york
city.
mr.
zimroth
is
wrong
in
my
opinion
in
saying
that
this
is
the
only
system
that
will
let
new
york
city
survive.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
is
that
i'm
not
sure
we've
done
very
well
with
it,
but
some
say
we
have.
i'm
not
sure
that
effectiveness
can
ever
be
a
criteria
for
this
court
because
that
will
place
it
in...
more
in
the
midst
of
any
political
thicket
than
it
ever
has
been
so
far
it
seems
to
me.
and
it's
also
important
to
note
that
there
is
a
charter
revision
commission
standing
in
abeyance
waiting
for
this
court's
decision
to
make
a
determination
with
the
many
alternatives
that
it
has
already
assessed
and
already
made
determinations
about
as
appropriate
to
maintain
the
wisdom
and
the
good
parts
of
this
mixed
district
and
at-large
scheme.
in
conclusion,
i
would
just
say
that
we
know
that
the
one
person/one
vote
rule
works
at
the
municipal
level
in
just
this
kind
of
system
nationally.
you
can't
avoid
by
any
method
of
computation
the
huge
disparities
that
exist
between
boroughs
that
range
in
population
from
six
to
one...
by
a
factor
of
six
to
one.
there's
no
question
that
the
queens
and
brooklyn
voter
gets
less
responsiveness
from
the
borough
president
than
the
staten
island
voter.
it's
clear
in
the
record.
and
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
that
the
city
has
presented
or
that
could
be
presented
that
the
at-large
city-wide
officials
favor
the
large
boroughs.
there's
no
evidence
of
that
sort
already,
and
that
we
hope
that
this
court
will
not
accept
an
equal
vote
for
boroughs,
but
will
again
reaffirm
its
doctrine
of
an
equal
vote
for
voters.
thank
you
very
much.
