mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
good
afternoon,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
declared
unconstitutional
a
body
which
for
roughly
90
years
has
been...
has
played
a
central
role
in
both
the
history
and
the
governance
of
the
city
of
new
york.
it
has
been
in
the
words
of
many
commentators
in
virtually
every,
single
serious
study
on
this
subject...
and
there
have
been
many...
the
glue
which
has
kept
the
city
of
new
york
together,
the...
the...
the
body
of
which
has
embodied
the
compromise
that
was
necessary
both
to
the
creation
of
the
city
of
new
york
at
the
turn
of
the
century
and
also
the...
its
continued
existence
as
times
have
changed.
the
central
factor,
the
central
consideration,
the
central
structural
point,
of
the
board
of
estimate
is
that
there
is
a
combination
of
city-wide
officials
who
control
the
majority
of
the
votes
and
five
borough
presidents
who...
who
control
the
majority
of
votes.
and
when
the
court
of
appeals
declared
this
body
unconstitutional,
it
simply
ignored
that
structure.
it
split
the
body
in
two.
it
said
the
city-wides
we're
not
going
to
consider.
it
said
the
five
borough
presidents
we're
going
to
consider
as
if
it
was...
as
if
it
were
a
legislature,
which
the
board
of
estimate
is
not.
independent
of
the
five
borough
presidents
and
declared
that
body
unconstitutional.
that
body
does
not
exist.
it
does
not
exist
in
new
york
city
government.
and
what
the...
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
is
basically
said
that
it
was
not
convenient
to
find
methodologies
to
judge
this
complex
body,
and
so
it
ignored
the
central
truth
about
the
board
of
estimate.
and
to
understand
why
this
is
the
central
truth
about
the
board
of
estimate,
you
have
to
understand
how
the
board
of
estimate
came
into
being.
the
board
of
estimate
was
a
product
of
the
consolidation
of
many
independent
entities
at
the
turn
of
the...
of
the
century,
the
consolidation
of
the
city
of
new
york.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
it's
the
city
charter.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
yes,
although
ultimately
it
is...
it
is
under
the
authority
of
the
state
legislature.
the
state
legislature,
obviously,
could
change
the
boundaries
or
the
voting
structure.
but...
but
the
voting
structure
that
i'm
talking
about
is
set
forth
in
the...
in
this...
in
the
city
charter--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--excuse
me?
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
there
are--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--in
some...
there
have
been
many
charter
revisions.
there
are
charter
revisions.
there
are
two...
basically
two
ways
you
can
have
a
charter
revision.
you
could
either
have
it
by
referendum,
or
you
can
have
it
by
the
state
legislature.
both
are
true
here.
in
other
words,
there
have
been
charter
revisions
in
1901,
1938,
1961,
1975,
and
i
think
there
was
one,
a
minor
one,
in
1983.
and
i
don't
remember
which
of
those
were
by
referendum
and
which
were
by
the
state...
by
the
state
legislature.
but
this
particular
voting
structure
has
been
approved
by
both
methods
because
in
each
time
it...
when
the...
when
the...
either
through
referendum,
the
people
vote
on
the
charter
or
the...
or
the
state
legislature
votes
so
that
in
both
ways
this...
this
structure
has
been...
has
been
approved.
and
again,
if...
if
you
look
back
to
the
history
of
the
consolidation
of
the
city,
what
you
have
is
several
independent...
independent
entities
who
cede
their
authority
to
a
central
government
and,
obviously,
demand
to
retain
some
manner
of
meaningful
voice
in
that...
in
that
centralized
government.
and
the
board
of
estimate
was
precisely
the
mechanism.
and
this
voting
structure
was
precisely
the
mechanism
which
expressed
that
compromise
to
resolve
the
tension
between
the
need
for
a
broader
municipality
to
give
services,
on
the
one
hard,
and
the
obviously
understandable
and
legitimate
desire
for
people
to
have
government
close
to
home.
so,
this
was
the
body
that
incorporated
that...
that
compromise.
and
it
has
been
in--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--yes.
three...
at
the
time
in...
in
the
turn
of
the
century
there
were
three
boroughs.
the
consolidation
of
the
city
of
new
york
was
the
borough
of
richmond/staten
island;
the
borough
of
manhattan,
which
was
then
the
city
of...
of
new
york;
and
the
borough
of
brooklyn,
which
was
the
city
of
brooklyn.
bronx
and
queens
were
made
up
of
amalgams
of...
of
towns
and
villages
from
either...
what
was
westchester
and
long
island.
so,
there
were
three
counties
that
got
together
and
many,
many
other
independent
entities
that
got
together
in
this
consolidation
at
the
turn
of
the
century.
and
it's
very
interesting
that...
i...
i
sort
of
like
to
look
at
the...
the
early
history
in
a
way
analogous
to
the
united
states'
articles
of
confederation
and
constitution.
in
1898
when...
when
the
body
was
first
created,
this
voting
structure
did
not
exist.
the
borough
presidents
didn't
have
a
vote
on
this
board.
and
that
very
fact
threatened
the
very
existence
of
the
consolidation.
and
there
was
a...
you
know,
there
was
a
very
big
uproar
from
the
boroughs
saying,
in
effect,
we
have
been
cheated...
we
have
ceded
our
powers
and
we
have
been
cheated
out
of
our
ability
to
have
a
meaningful
voice
in
the
governance.
and
so,
in
1901
there
was
a
second
charter
revision
which...
which
created
the
structure
that
we
have
now
which
has,
in
essence,
existed
to
this
day;
that
is
with
a
majority
of
city-wides,
a
minority
of
borough
presidents,
a
system
which,
if
you
look
at
the
arithmetic,
you
can...
with
respect
to
all
of
the
actions
which
the
board
of
estimate
has
exclusive
power
over,
they
cannot
take
an
action
without
a
concurrence
of...
of
representatives
representing
a
majority
of
the
people
of
the
city
of
new
york.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
it
still
has
a
system
of
weighted
voting.
the
weighted
votes
are:
the
city-wides
have
two
votes
each,
and
the
borough
presidents
have
one
vote
each.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
well,
it...
it--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--yes.
the
change
was
this.
in
1901
two
boroughs,
manhattan
and
brooklyn,
had
88
percent
of
the
population.
so,
they
were
given
a...
the
original
structure
was
three
votes
for
the
city-wides,
two
for
manhattan
and
brooklyn,
and
one
for
the
other
three.
nineteen
fifty-eight,
because
of
the
change
in
population,
the
growth
of
queens
primarily
and
the
fact
that
manhattan
and
brooklyn
no
longer
had
88
percent
of
the
population,
the
structure
was
changed
to,
in
essence,
what
we
have
now.
it
was
actually
four
and
two,
and
then
it
was
change
just
for
arithmetic's
purpose
to
two
and
one,
but
it's
the
same
ratio.
and
that's
what
happened
in
1958.
it
has
been
an
evolutionary
process,
and
what
has
happened
in
the
city
of
new
york
is
that
more
and
more
power
has
been
transferred
from
the
formerly
independent
entities
to
the
central
government.
and
that
very
process
has
made
it
even
more
important
that...
that
there
be
some
kind
of
a
mechanism
for
the...
for
the
boroughs
to
have
a
voice
in
the
central
government.
it
has
been
a
body
that's
proved
to
be
flexible
enough
to
deal
with
changing
dynamics
of
the
city
of
new
york.
just
to
give
you
one
example
among
many,
as
racial
minorities
and
ethnic
minorities
in
the
city
have
grown
more
and
more
populous
and
more
and
more
powerful,
the
board
of
estimate
has
adapted
itself.
there
are...
now,
for
example,
two
of
the
five
borough
presidents
are
minorities,
one
an
hispanic
and
one
a...
a
black.
the
district--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--well,
as
this
court--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--they
did
not.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
they
did
not.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
we
think...
there
is
no
method
that
this
court
has
used
that
is
capable
of
doing
that.
so,
we
have...
we
have
suggested
two
methods.
one
method
is...
is
a
sort
of
a...
i
think
a
common
sense
method,
which
is
what
i
said
earlier,
and
that
is
that
if
you
look
at
the...
the
votes,
there
is
no
way
with
respect
to
those
actions
that
the
board
of
estimate
can
take
on
its
own...
there
is
no
way
that
an
action
can
be
taken
without
the
concurrence
of
representatives
representing
a
majority
of
the
population.
let
me
give
you
an
example
of
what
i
mean.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
budget
matters
is
not...
it
is
not
true
of
some
budget
matters...
some
budget
matters.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
i'm
glad
you
raised
the
budget
matters
because,
frankly,
on
reflection
i
wish...
i
wish
we
had
said
more
about
that
in...
in
the
briefs
because
there's
a...
i
think
a
very
serious
misconception
about
the
board
of
estimate's
role
in
budget
matters.
just
to...
to
sort
of
start
with
the
conclusion
and
then
to
explain
it,
in
fiscal
year
1986,
there
were
93
votes
on
budget
matters.
the
mayor
was
excluded
from
seven
of
those.
almost
all
budget
matters
include
the
mayor
as
a
vote.
now
i'll
explain
to
you
what
that
means.
the
budgetary
process
has
many
different
facets
to
it.
the
mayor
actually
is
the
premier
person
in
this...
in
this...
in
this
whole
scenario.
why?
because
under
new
york
law,
there
has
to
be
a
balanced
budget
and
the
mayor
estimates
the
revenues.
so,
once
the
mayor
estimates
the
revenues,
there
can
be
no
increase
in
the
budget
unless
there's
an
increase
in
property
tax.
the
only
body
authorized
to
do
that
is
the
city
council,
not
the
board
of
estimate.
the
board
of
estimate
plays
no
role
whatsoever
in
that
decision.
on
the
adoption...
original
adoption
of
the
budget,
the
mayor
proposes
the
budget.
and
if
there
is
going
to
be
a
change
without
the
mayor's
approval,
it
requires
the...
the
joint
action
of
both
the
city
council
and
the
board
of
estimate,
and
one
of
those
two
bodies
has
to
vote
by
a
two-thirds
majority.
otherwise,
there
can't...
there
can't
be
any
change.
and
as
i
say,
there
can't
be
a...
a
raising
without
additional
taxes,
and
the
additional
taxes
can
come
only
from
the
city
council,
not
the
board
of
estimate.
that's
the--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--can
i
just
finish
the
rest
of
the
budgetary
process?
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
that's
only
at
one
time
in
the
year.
throughout
the
rest
of
the
year,
there
are
many,
many
changes
in
the
budget
because
under
new
york
law,
the
budget
is...
is
not
a
mandate
to...
to
spend.
it's
an
authorization
to
spend.
and
the
mayor
doesn't
have
to
spend
any
of
it
or
any
part
of
it.
that's
not...
i'm
not
talking
about
an
impoundment
kind
of
situation
where
there's
a
mandate
to
spend
because
the
budget
is
not
a
mandate
to
spend.
so,
that's
the
first
point,
that
this
budget
is
not
what
you
think
of
ordinarily.
the
second
point
is
that
the
mayor
and
the
agency
heads
can
without
any
further
action
transfer
money
from
one
part
of
the
budget
to
another
part
of
the
budget
as
long
as
it's
within
the
same
agency
and
as
long
as
it's
not
so
much
as
to...
there's
a
percentage
that...
that
can't
be
overcome.
and
if
that
percentage
is
overcome,
then
there
has
to
be
another
budget
action.
and
on
that
budget
action,
the
mayor
votes
on
the
board
of
estimate.
and
that's
what
most
of
the
budget
actions
are.
that's
why
i
said
that
in
fiscal
1986--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--that's
correct.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
i
don't
deny
that
they
have
importance.
i
only
say
that
the
board
of
estimate's
role
in
that
process
is
very
limited.
they
cannot
act
at
all
without
the
concurrence
of
the
city
council.
they
cannot
act
at
all
if
the
city
council
votes
by
a
majority
to
disagree
with
the
mayor.
they...
they
need
two-thirds
or
vice
versa.
and,
i
mean,
the
reality
of
the
budgetary
process
is
i
think
very
clear.
if
you
look
at
the
budgets
over
history,
the
mayor
is
the
central
actor,
a
city-wide
official
elected
by
all
the
people
of
the
city...
is
the
central
actor.
the
changes
in
the
budgets
year
after
year
after
year
are
frankly
minuscule
compared
to
a
$25
billion
budget.
you're
talking
about
like
a
half
of
one
percent
of
a
quarter
or
a
percent.
that's
the
kind
of...
of
power
you're
talking
about.
i
can't
say
it's
not
important,
you
know,
but...
but
it
is
what
it
is.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
i'm
sorry.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
it
depends
on
how
you
factor
them
in.
there's
one
way
of
factoring
them
in
which
would
divide
the
number
of
city-wide
votes
proportionately
among
all
of
the
counties.
that
is,
if
brooklyn
has
31
percent
of
the
population
and
there
are
six
city-wide
votes,
you
give
brooklyn
31
percent
of
six,
whatever
that
is,
and
you
say
that's
brooklyn
votes.
if
you
use
that
method,
you
come
up
with
a
number
of
76
percent.
that
methodology
was
rejected
by
plaintiffs,
by
plaintiffs'
experts
and
by
both
courts
below.
they
said
it's
completely
arbitrary.
it
has...
i
mean,
you're
dividing
something,
but
what
are
you...
what
are
you
measuring?
but
that's
the
answer
to
your
question.
that's
the
result
you
get
if
you
use
that
methodology.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
no.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
to
a...
no.
there
was
not.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
which...
which
method?
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
the
one
that
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
plaintiffs
rejected.
i
don't
know
what
the
answer
would
be.
i'd
have
to--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--no,
no.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
i
didn't
say
there
were
several
ways
under
the
abate
method.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
i
said
we
suggested
two
ways.
one
way
is
to...
is
to
just
look
at
the
body
itself
and
say
that
with
this
narrow
exception
that
justice
stevens
pointed
to,
that
with
respect
to
the
other
actions...
and
really
those
are
actions
which...
which
the
board
of
estimate
acts
exclusively.
they
don't
have
to
act
in
concurrence
with
the
city
council...
that
there's
no
way
that
a...
that
an
action
can
be
taken
without
the
concurrence
of...
of
elected
officials
who
represent
the
majority
of
people.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
excuse
me?
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
one
of
those,
but
if
there's
one
of
those--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--it
takes
four
borough
presidents
which
at
a
minimum
represents
70
percent
of
the
people
of
the
city.
that's
right.
now,
the
other
way
that
we
suggested
is
the--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--absolutely
not.
they
don't.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
okay.
i'll
tell
you
what
it
is.
if...
if
there
are...
if
there
are
three
city-wides...
if
they
all
vote
together,
they
obviously
control
the
six
votes.
okay?
so,
put
that
aside.
the
only
way
that...
so
then
you
have
to
say
what
happens
if
there's
a
two
to
one
split.
and
as
i
just
answered,
the
only
way
that
the
one
can
prevail
over
the
two
is
if
representatives
of
70
percent
of
the
people
of
new
york
join
that
person.
now,
that's
one
way
of
doing
it.
i
think
it's
a
common
sense
way.
it
obviously...
it
describes
much
more
realistically
than
what
the...
what
the
courts
below
did
what
the
actual
body
is.
i
mean,
that
is
the
body.
what
they
judge
unconstitutional
is
not
the
body.
there's
another
way
that
we...
that
we
suggested,
and
that
is
a
method
originally
devised
by
professor
barzhaf.
and
that
method
does
two
things.
first
of
all,
it--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--no.
i'm
talking
about
the
four...
the
four
borough
presidents
to
join
with
the
one,
done
city-wide.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
it
is
true.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
they
do
have
a
larger
voice.
i
don't
deny
that
they
have
a
larger
voice.
my...
my
point
is
how
to
measure
that
larger
voice.
and
what
is
the
meaning
of
that
larger
voice
in
the
context
of...
of
this
case?
that
is,
to
say
what
the
court
of
appeals
said--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--right.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
yes,
but...
but
they
represent
them
in
a
context
where
that
difference
is
much,
much
less
significant
than
if
there
were
a
five-member
body
that
had
no
city-wides.
supposing
there
were...
supposing
there
were
100
city-wide
votes,
what
you
say
would
still
be
true,
but
those...
and
those
five
borough
presidents
would
still
have
equal
power.
zero
it
would
be.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
let
me...
let
me...
maybe
there's
another
way
i
can
illustrate
this
point.
and
if
i
could
beg
your
indulgence
to
turn
to
page
34
of
the
brief
where
there's
a
chart
which
illustrates
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make.
if
you
use
the...
if
you
use
the
methodology
chosen
by
the
district
court
and
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
simply
ask
that
each
borough
president
has
a
vote
in
proportion
to
the
population
of
that
borough,
you
get
in
essence
meaningless
results
because
that
chart
that...
that
appears
on
page
3...
34
is
in
exact
proportion...
34
of
our
brief...
is
in
exact
proportion
to
population.
now--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--yes.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
that's
it.
that's
in
exact
proportion
to
population.
that
adds
up
to
51
votes.
if
you
give
the
three
city-wide
elected
officials
50
votes
each,
you
will
see...
and
you
can
work
it
out,
and
in
the
text
it
is
worked
out...
that
it
doesn't
matter.
it
just
doesn't
matter
what
those
weighted
votes
are.
every
single
combination
indicates
that
staten
island
has
exactly
the
same
power
as
bronx,
manhattan,
queens
and
vice
versa.
i
would
be
very
curious,
frankly,
to
hear
from
mr.
emery
whether
he
would
accept
this
system
which
meets
exactly
the
test
of
the
court
of
appeals...
exactly.
he
has
got
to
say
either
one
of
two
things.
either
he
says--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--no,
because
what
will
happen
is
that
in
the
remedy
stage,
mr.
emery
will
get
up
and
say,
horrors,
this
is
unconstitutional.
why?
because
it
doesn't
take
into
account
the
relationship
between
the
borough
votes
and
the
city-wide
votes.
he'll
have
it...
he'll
want
to
have
it
both
ways.
he'll
want
to
have
it
both
ways.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
well,
i
guess
you
could
ask
him.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
well,
but
i
mean,
he...
his
experts
did
exactly
this
below.
they
did
this
below
because
in
the
district
court
they
tried
to
devise
alternative
methodologies
of
weighted
voting.
and
when
they...
and
when
they
weighted...
when
they
decided
to
figure
out
how
much
the
deviation
was,
they
used
a
methodology
very
similar
to
what
we
are
saying.
and
they
rejected
the
methodology
that
they
had
just
won
on.
and
the
reason
they
did
that
is
precisely
this,
that
is,
it's
illogical
to
judge
a--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--only
if
you
say...
only
if
you
say
that
this
system
is
constitutional
because
if
you
say
that,
maybe--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--if
the--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--if
you
accept--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--the
methodology
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
we
say--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--no.
but
for
a
different
reason
because
i
think--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--yes,
but...
but--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--that's
right.
and
we'll
lose
because
they'll...
they
will
reject
the
methodology
of
the
court
of
appeals.
that's
what...
that's
exactly
what's
going
to
happen.
and
it's
exactly
what
did
happen
in
the
district
court.
they
abandoned
their
previous
method
in
the
district
court.
they
have
to
because
if
they
accept
that
methodology,
then
they
have
to
accept
this,
and
they...
and
they
won't.
the
reason
they
won't
is
that
this
describes
the
same
system
or
virtually
the
same
system
we
have
today.
the
reason
i
think
this
is
constitutional
is
because
i
think
the
present
system
is
constitutional.
and
the
reason
i
think
one
present
system
is
constitutional
is
that
this
court's
one
person/one
vote
jurisprudence
pays
very
strong
attention
to
all
of
the
factors
that...
that
went
into
the
creation
of
the...
of
the
board
of
estimate.
it's...
it's
a
body
which
has
been
very
successful
and
effective
in
keeping
this
very
large
city
together.
those
findings
were
made
by
the
district
court.
the
district
court
found
that
this
body
was
effective
in
that
way.
it's
a
structure
that
has
proved
flexible
enough
to
accommodate
the...
the
changes
in
the
city.
it
has
met
the
test
of
time
again
and
again
and
again.
charter
revision
commissions
have
looked
at
this
system
and
said
that
this
compromise
is
necessary
to
the
continued
existence
of
the
city
and
to
the...
essential
to
the
well-being
of
the
city.
the
question
that
i
would
ask
is
even
in
terms
of
the
democratic
principles
that
the
one
person/one
vote
is
supposed
to
and
does
further,
what
is
to
be
gained
by
destroying
this
body.
if
you
look
at
what
happened,
for
example--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--because--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--because
the--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--because
the
voting
structure
is
the
body,
and
if
you
change
the
voting
structure,
you
have
a
different
body.
the
voting
structure
is
the
compromise
that
allowed
the
city
to
get
together.
if
you
destroy
that--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--well,
of
course--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--of
course
not,
but...
but--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--the
big
differences
are
that
this
court
has
always
said...
it
has
to
be
rational.
i
mean,
that
is,
the
distinctions
have
to
be
rational.
and
when
the
court...
and
when
the
court
went...
in
its
one
person/one
vote
jurisprudence
has
set
forth
the
kinds
of
things
that
have
been...
that
are
legitimate
considerations,
the
respecting
of
the
historical
precedent,
the
consolidation--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--i
would
say
that
the
history
is
a
very...
the
history
and
the
success
of
it--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--i
doubt
that
it
would
work.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
i
mean,
it...
i
mean,
in
all
seriousness--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--well,
not--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--this
is
not
something--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--only
that
was
set
up
in
1890.
it
was
something
that
has
been
reaffirmed
by
every,
single
charter
revision
commission
since
then.
every
one
has
said
that
this
structure
is
the
glue
that
has
kept
the
city
of
new
york
together
and
don't
change
it.
and
all
i'm
saying
is--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--disintegrate?
i
think
there
will
be
very
serious
consequences,
yes.
or,
alternatively,
this
is
what
will
happen.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
there
has
been
very
serious
discussion
of
that.
i
don't
know
whether
it
will
happen.
but
there
has,
in
fact,
been
serious
discussion
of
that.
i
hope
it
won't
happen.
i
mean,
obviously
it
will
be
very
disastrous
for
the
city
of
new
york
it
that
happened,
but
very
important
people
in...
in
staten
island
are...
are
talking
about
secession.
that's
number
one.
number
two
is
that...
i'm
not
suggesting
to
you
that
just
because
there
has
been
this
history,
you
know,
one
time
90
years
ago,
that's
the
end
of
it.
it
is
a
history
that
the
court
below
has...
has
found
credible,
has
succeeded
throughout
time
in
creating
the
glue
that
has
kept
the
city
of
new...
new
york
together.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
yes,
it
is.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
no,
of
course,
it
can't.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
but...
but
the...
but
the
legislators
and
the
people
of
the
city
will
take
very
seriously
the
need
for
this...
this
kind
of
problem.
let
me
give
you
an
example.
the
board
of
education
in
the
city
of
new
york
at
one
time
was...
was
structured
in
a
way
similar
to
this,
not
exactly
the
same.
there
was
five...
five...
the
borough
voted
for
five
members
of
the
board
of
education,
and
there
were
then
two
others
city-wide.
that
was
declared
unconstitutional.
because
of
the...
of
the
perceived
need
for
that
kind
of
structure,
what
happened
is
that
you
have
now
an
appointed
system
for
the
board
of
education
where
the
borough
presidents
appoint.
now,
is
that
a
net
gain
for
democracy?
that
is
what...
among
the
very
many
things
that
are
being
discussed
now.
that
is,
if
this
structure
goes
down,
what
you
may
find...
i
can't
say
what
will
happen,
but
what
you
may
find
is
each
one
of
the
power
of
the
board
of
estimate
will
be
separated
out
and
they'll
be
given
to
either
an
appointed
body
on
to
the
mayor
to...
to
increase
the
centralized
power.
i
don't
see
that
is
a
net
gain
for
democracy
when
you
have
a
system
that
has
been
effective,
which
has
worked,
and
which
overall
respects
majority
rule.
we're
not
talking
about
a
situation
where--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--what
year
was
tweed,
your
honor?
i'm
sorry.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
what?
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
no.
the
consolidation
was
at
the
end
of
19th,
beginning
of
the
20th
century.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
no,
no.
the
beginning
of
the
20th
century.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
your
honor,
may
i...
may
i
reserve
the
rest
of--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
wow.
very
quickly.
mr.
emery
cites
franklin
v.
krause
as
an
example
of
the
kind
of
case
that
this
court
should
give
credence
to.
that
was
a
case
in
which
the
courts
in
new
york
rejected
the
abate
method
and
used
a
method
of
analysis
similar
to
the
one
that
we
have
suggested.
mr.
emery
is
now,
in
effect,
backing
off
from
the
court
of
appeals
methodology.
