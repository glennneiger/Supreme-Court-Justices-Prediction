unknown
speaker
the
city
charter.
unknown
speaker
does
the
legislature
specifically
approve
the
city
charter?
unknown
speaker
did
the
legislature--
unknown
speaker
--specifically
approve
the
city
charter?
unknown
speaker
were
the...
mr.
zimroth,
were
the
boroughs
part
of
this
structure
by
charter
also?
unknown
speaker
mr.
zimroth,
i...
i
take
it
for
many
years,
until
about
1958,
the
board
of
estimate
followed
a
system
of
weighted
voting?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
was
the
change
made
in
1958?
it
was
some
significant
change.
unknown
speaker
and
maybe
you
could
enlighten
us
about
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
zimroth,
what...
what
would
the
voting
deviation
be,
as
this
court
normally
measures
it,
if
we
included
the
at-large
members
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
the
court
below
didn't
include
them.
unknown
speaker
and
suppose
we
took
account
of
that.
unknown
speaker
then
what's
the
deviation.
unknown
speaker
mr.
zimroth,
is
that
true
of
budget
matters?
unknown
speaker
xxx.
unknown
speaker
mr.
zimroth?
unknown
speaker
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
but
there
are
some
on
which
he
may
not
vote.
unknown
speaker
and
i
presume
they
are
of
some
importance
or
they
wouldn't
have
a
special
legal
rule
for
those
particular
votes.
unknown
speaker
xxx
justice
kennedy
has
a
question
for
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
justice
o'connor
began
asking
you
about
the
population
deviation.
and
i
was
interested
in
pursuing
that.
if
we
use
the
abate
method
and
took
the
three
at-large
officers
and
factored
them
into
the
analysis,
what
would
the
population
deviation
be?
or
can
we
not
determine
that
based
on
this
record?
unknown
speaker
did
the
parties
stipulate
to
some
deviation?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
there
was
some
kind
of
a
stipulation.
unknown
speaker
using
the
same
method,
what
would
the
deviation
be
if
you
added
one
more
at-large
member?
unknown
speaker
the
method
you
just
described.
unknown
speaker
before
you
started
to
say
there
were
several
ways
to
do
it
under
the
abate
method,
and
you--
unknown
speaker
--described
one.
unknown
speaker
oh,
okay.
unknown
speaker
and
that
only
takes
one.
unknown
speaker
it
only
takes
one
of
those--
unknown
speaker
--yes?
unknown
speaker
in
that
example,
do
you
assume
all
the
people
elected
at
large
will
always
vote
in
the
same
way?
unknown
speaker
then
i
don't
quite
understand
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
you
went
a
little
fast
for
me.
seventy
percent
of
the
people
of
new
york.
you're
talking
about
two
representatives?
two...
two--
unknown
speaker
--well,
they
only...
they
have
one
vote
apiece.
so,
you
need
six
votes
all
together.
but
is
it
still
not
true
that
their
votes
are
all
counted
equally
in
that...
among
those
four?
unknown
speaker
so
that
the
people
from
the
smallest
borough
have
a
larger
voice
in
that
vote
than
the
people
in
the--
unknown
speaker
--the
meaning
i
suppose
is
that
the
borough
president
from
staten
island
has
the
same
voice
as
the
borough
president
from
brooklyn.
unknown
speaker
and...
and
they
represent
widely
different
populations.
unknown
speaker
well,
no,
because
if
you
assume
that
there's...
say
there's
some
issue
on
the
bronx
he's
opposed
to,
he
has
got
to
pick
up
one
vote
to
defeat
the
issue.
and
the
one
vote
from...
from
staten
island
is
enough
or
the
vote
from
brooklyn
is
enough.
unknown
speaker
the...
the...
the
chart
being
just
one
setting
forth--
unknown
speaker
--of
the
various
boroughs?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
would
seem
to
me
what
it
boils
to
is
if
the
court
goes
ahead
and
enters
relief
along
the
lines
they've
discussed,
it
really
won't
do
any
harm
to
you.
unknown
speaker
how...
how
do
we
know
that
at
this
stage
of
the
case?
unknown
speaker
maybe
you're
arguing
something
you
ought
to
be
arguing
after
the
case
goes
back.
unknown
speaker
you
really
are...
you
really
are
convincing
me
there's
not
much
at
stake
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
it,
don't
you,
that
what
you
propose
on
page
34
would
be
perfectly
constitutional?
unknown
speaker
it
may
not
be
mandated,
but
if
it
had
originally
been
done
this
way,
there
would
be
no
constitutional
difficulty,
would
there?
unknown
speaker
would
you
not
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
no.
forget
the...
just...
i
asked
you
a
very
simple
question.
in
your
view
if
your
present
system
had
the
figures
in
it
that
you
have
on
page
34
of
your
brief,
would
you
think
there
was
any
constitutional
problem?
unknown
speaker
and
you...
and
conceivably
that's
what
you'll
get
when
you
get
all
through.
unknown
speaker
you're
afraid
you
may
lose
when
you
get
back.
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
assume
the
body
will
be
destroyed?
i
said
why
do
you
assume
the
body
will
be
destroyed.
unknown
speaker
it
will
be
changed.
unknown
speaker
the
voting
will
be
a
little
different.
unknown
speaker
supposing
they
made
a
compromise
in
queens,
women
won't
vote,
and
in...
in
the
bronx
they
will,
and
we'd
say
that's
how
they
made
the
deal.
it
happens
to
be
unconstitutional.
are
we
going
to
just
say,
well--
unknown
speaker
--it
was
good
deal
when
they
made
it,
so
it
has
got
to
be
preserved?
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
if
you
had
no
history
at
all,
could
you
start
out
constitutionally?
just
start
from
scratch
and
say
we
want
to
dream
up
a
new
system,
a
brand...
could
you
start
and
do
what
you've
got
there
now?
or
do
you
have
to
have
this
history
to
justify
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
sure.
but
supposing
i've
got
a
successful
thing
where
women
don't
vote
in
the
bronx,
and
it
has
worked,
can
you
keep
it?
unknown
speaker
well--
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
we're
limited
to
our
last
successes.
we
can't
have
any
more
successes
in
the
future.
unknown
speaker
any
good
thing
that
was
set
up
in...
in
1890...
that
can
last,
but--
unknown
speaker
--that's
the
end
of
the
story.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
new
york
is
going
to
disintegrate
if
you
lose
this
lawsuit?
you
really--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
think
staten
island
is
going
to
secede?
unknown
speaker
but
the
city
is
a
legislative
construct,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean,
new
york
just
can't
say
we're
going
to
fall
apart.
unknown
speaker
it--
unknown
speaker
--you
keep
talking
about
going
back.
did
this
start
back
in
the
tweed
machine?
unknown
speaker
eighteen
seventy.
unknown
speaker
eighteen
seventy.
unknown
speaker
nineteen
twenty?
unknown
speaker
yes,
that's
what
i
thought.
unknown
speaker
yes,
you
say.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
emery.
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
elected
municipal
governing
bodies,
do
any
of
our
cases
apply
to
something
just
like
this
or
something
very
close
to
it?
it
isn't
the
city
council,
it's
something
different
than
that.
unknown
speaker
but
that
was
the
governing
body
of
the
county,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
can
you...
can
you...
if
you
split
it
up
that
way,
you
can
get
to
the
position
where
every
single
board
that
has
jurisdiction
is
the...
is
the
governing
body
for
that
minimal...
minimal
responsibility
that
it
has.
unknown
speaker
is
this...
is
that
for
the
city
council?
unknown
speaker
is
that
for
the
city
council
or
for
something
like
the
board
of
estimate?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that
doesn't
tell
us
whether
or
not
a
city
can
split
off
some
functions
from
the
city
council
and
still
be
governed
by
the
one
person/one
vote
rule.
unknown
speaker
how...
how...
why
is
it
that
the
five
borough
presidents
vote
together
so
often?
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
it?
about
97
percent
of
the
time?
unknown
speaker
how
often
do
the
borough
presidents
disagree
in
that
category
of
issues
that
you
say
are
really--
unknown
speaker
--got
some
meat
to
them?
unknown
speaker
even...
even
if
you
had
the
system
set
up
on
page
34
of
the--
unknown
speaker
--petitioner's
brief?
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
it
would
be
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
is...
is
there
any
system
that
gives
the
borough...
that
would
give
the
borough
presidents
a
significant
role
and
pass
constitutional
muster?
unknown
speaker
but
the
issue...
but
the
issue
is,
for
purposes
of
how
you
do
this
calculation--
unknown
speaker
--how...
how...
how
far
away
from
a
proper
premium
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
what
counts
how
far
my...
my
vote
as
an
individual
in...
in
the
decision
that
is
made...
how
far
away
from...
from
fully
equal
that
is?
and
for
purposes
of
that,
don't
you
have
to
decide
how
is
the
decision
made?
unknown
speaker
well,
shouldn't
the
fact
that
i
vote
for
the
mayor
and
the
controller
and
the
city
council
president...
shouldn't
that
be
taken
into
account
in
deciding
the
whole
thing?
unknown
speaker
we're...
we're
not
talking
about
officials;
we're
talking
about
government
decisions.
unknown
speaker
and
it
seems
to
me
what's
crucial
is
how
far
my
input
into
a
particular
government
decision
is
away
from
absolute
equality
with
the
other
people
in
the...
in
the
city.
unknown
speaker
xxx
think
that
new
york
city
would
have
been
formed
had
the
rule
that
you're
urging
been
in
effect
at
that
time?
unknown
speaker
the
thing
is
we
can
all
join
together,
but
when
we
all
join
together,
there's
going
to
be
no
special
election
of
any
particular
representative
for
staten
island
or
for
brooklyn
or
for
queens?
unknown
speaker
but
i'm
impressed
by
the
fact
that
you
say
that
a
lot
of
other
cities
have
voting
systems
such
as
this.
and
that
suggests
to
me
that
very
often
a
municipal
arrangement
would
never...
would
never
be
arrived
at
unless
the
people
of
the
relatively
discrete
units
that
vote
to
join
together
have
some
assurance
that
there...
that
there
is
some
home
rule,
so
to
speak,
that
they
car
vote
as...
as
a
discrete
unit.
unknown
speaker
mr.
emery,
you--
unknown
speaker
--you
talk
about--
unknown
speaker
--how
many...
how
widespread
this
is.
give
me
a
name
of
another
city
that
has
boroughs.
unknown
speaker
or
borough
presidents.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean,
you
say
that
this
is
so
common.
i
just--
unknown
speaker
--can
you
give
me
one
that's
similar
to
new
york?
unknown
speaker
can
you
name
me
one
that's
similar
to
new
york?
unknown
speaker
have
you
got
one
more,
just
one
more?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
what
in
the
world
are
you
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
in
pennsylvania
you
have
boroughs
which
are
like
towns
in
new
england
i
think.
unknown
speaker
they're
towns.
unknown
speaker
xxx.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
virginia
beach
solution
would
be
acceptable
in
this--
unknown
speaker
--situation
where
you--
unknown
speaker
--elect
everyone
at
large,
but...
but
you
have
residence
requirements?
unknown
speaker
well,
if...
if...
if
you're
trying
to
make
some
sort
of
a
place
for
staten
island
in
the
system,
i
suppose
if
the...
if
the
representative
from
staten
island
has
one
vote
and
the
representative
from
brooklyn
has
20
votes,
maybe
the
guy
from
staten
island
just
won't
come
to
the
meetings.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
emery.
mr.
zimroth,
you
have
less
than
a
minute
left.
