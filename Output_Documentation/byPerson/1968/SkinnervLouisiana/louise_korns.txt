ms.
louise
korns
yes
,sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
before
beginning
the
argument,
i'd
like
to
inquire
if
the
court
--
is
the
court
interested
in
this
third
point
on
which
it
grants
certiorari,
the
conspiracy
charge
to
the
jury
or
is
this
court
interested
only
in
the
two
points
which
petitioners
have
briefed?
when
this
court
granted
certiorari,
three
points
were
presented
to
this
court
as
allegations
are
there
in
the
court
below.
one
of
them
was
that
the
trial
judge
charged
the
jury
in
this
case
on
the
law
of
conspiracy
although
conspiracy
was
not
formerly
charged
in
the
bill
of
information.
now,
although
petitioners
urged
this
strongly
in
their
application
for
certiorari
in
their
brief
in
this
court,
they
don't
brief
this
point.
they
say
they
don't
think
this
court
is
interested
in
it.
now,
we
briefed
it
very
strongly,
however,
if
this
court
is
not
interested
in
it,
naturally,
louisiana
will
not
argue
it.
ms.
louise
korns
very
well,
your
honors.
i'll
answer
three
of
the
points
then.
as
far
as
the
facts
of
the
case
go,
i'll
just
briefly
recapitulate
what
mr.
leppert
said
that
this
charge
grows
out
of
a
may
21st
sale
of
heroin
on
skinner's
motor
lot,
motor
mart
to
state
undercover
agent
ben
fullington.
the
test
--
undercover
agent
fullington
testified
that
he
went
to
skinner's
motor
mart
that
day,
met
skinner
and
gueldner,
told
him
that
he
was
interested
in
getting
some
marijuana
that
either
skinner
or
gueldner
place
to
telephone
call,
told
the
undercover
agent
he
could
have
the
marijuana
later
that
day.
fullington
testified
that
he
return
to
the
motor
mart
around
8
that
evening
was
introduced
by
either
skinner
or
gueldner
to
chauvenet.
the
third
accused
in
this
case,
that
chauvenet
told
the
agent
the
stuff
as
they
call
the
marijuana
is
in
that
white
lincoln
parked
on
the
lot.
that
fullington
went
and
got
a
matchbox
of
marijuana
out
of
the
lincoln
and
paid
chauvenet
$20.00.
now,
a
week
later
on
the
28th
of
may,
undercover
agent
russell
abe
who
was
working
in
close
collaboration
with
ben
fullington
on
this
case,
the
testimony
shows
that
on
this
week
later
that
gueldner
phoned
russell
abe
and
told
him
that
the
connection
that
he'd
spoken
to
him
about
was
that
the
lot
and
that
would
sell
him
marijuana
that
russell
abe
went
to
the
lot
and
was
introduced
to
chauvenet
on
this
date
a
week
later.
chauvenet
took
him
into
an
office,
sold
him
nine
marijuana
cigarettes.
gueldner
also
testified
that
he
had
told
gueldner
--
i
mean
russell
abe
also
testified
that
he
told
gueldner
a
day
or
so
beforew
this
meeting,
that
he
was
interested
in
contacts
that
would
sell
the
heroin
or
marijuana.
on
this
second
date,
may
28,
after
chauvenet
had
sold
abe
the
nine
marijuana
cigarettes
in
the
office
at
the
motor
lot,
he
said,
“how
about
some
heroin?”
and
chauvenet
said,
“i'll
get
you
some,
let's
get
in
my
car.”
they
went
in
chauvenet's
car
to
a
spot
away
from
the
motor
mart.
there,
chauvenet
obtained
some
heroin
which
he
sold
to
gueldner
then
on
chauvenet's
instructions,
gueldner
drove
chauvenet
back
to
skinner's
lot.
on
this
date,
skinner
and
gueldner
were
at
the
lot.
gueldner
had
spoken
to
them
about
getting
heroin
and
after
the
sale
of
heroin,
chauvenet
was
taken
at
chauvenet's
direction
back
to
skinner's
lot.
now,
louisiana
will
first
discuss
the
absence
of
chauvenet
from
the
preliminary
motions
filed
at
the
hearing
of
the
preliminary
motions
filed
by
the
other
two
accused.
these
three
men
were
arrested
on
july
30th.
skinner
and
gueldner
employed
mr.
gill
to
represent.
chauvenet
appeared
with
the
other
two
for
arraignment,
had
no
lawyer.
the
court
entered
a
plea
of
not
guilty
for
him,
told
him
to
return
in
a
few
days
to
determine
counsel.
the
september
--
the
betsy
storm
came
in
there
somewhere,
anyway,
because
the
court
proceedings
were
delayed
but
anyway
the
court
appointed
the
first
lawyer
to
represent
chauvenet
sometime
around
at
the
end
of
september.
unlike
the
allegation,
contrary
to
the
contention
made
by
my
opponents,
a
year
did
not
elapse
between
the
arrest
of
chauvenet
and
his
retention
of
mr.
link
here,
six
months
elapsed.
chauvenet
was
arrested
around
the
first
of
august,
that
is
on
the
30th
of
july.
he
retained
mr.
link
on
the
18th
of
january
of
the
following
year.
during
that
six
months
period,
the
court
appointed
three
lawyers
for
mr.
chauvenet.
none
of
them
did
anything
for
him.
however,
mr.
link
concedes
in
his
motion
that
he
filed
later
which
i
will
refer
later
that
it
was
because
of
illness.
in
fact,
one
of
them
died,
mr.
bentley
burns
who
was
a
prominent
lawyer.
i
don't
know
mr.
joseph
mooney
myself,
the
first
lawyer
appointed
but
i
do
know
that
mr.
bentley
burns
and
mr.
morris
burke
are
competent
lawyers
that
--
who
take
care
of
their
clients
there.
the
allegation
is
that
they
were
sick.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
they
were
not
sick.
ms.
louise
korns
no,
sir.
there's
nothing
your
honor
that
our
only
position
is
--
ms.
louise
korns
the
only
position
is
that
the
judge
says,
you
come
back
and
then
committed
it
to
jail.
ms.
louise
korns
our
position
is
this
mr.
justice
that
chauvenet
had
a
lawyer
all
this
time.
because
of
illness
these
lawyers
could
not
--
did
not
file
pleadings
on
his
behalf
nor
did
skinner
and
gueldner
notify
chauvenet
or
his
lawyers
that
they
had
filed
these
motions.
now,
right
off
louisiana
will
concede
that
it
would
have
been
better
if
chauvenet
had
been
in
present
at
those
pre-trial
hearings
of
skinner
and
gueldner.
there's
no
doubt
about
it.
our
position
is
if
this
court
should
give
chauvenet
a
new
trial
because
of
this
--
his
absence
from
these
motions,
he
would
be
on
no
better
position
than
the
trial
judge
placed
him
in
at
this
trial
for
this
reason.
these
hearings
were
held
on
behalf
of
skinner
and
gueldner.
before
the
trial,
60
days
before
the
trial,
chauvenet
engaged
mr.
link
to
represent
him.
on
--
mr.
link
went
into
court
at
this
time
and
filed
a
motion
set
out
on
page
11
of
louisiana's
brief.
a
written
motion
in
which
mr.
link
said
pointed
out
to
the
court
that
because
of
illness,
the
three
lawyers
whom
the
court
had
appointed
to
represent
chauvenet
had
been
unable
to
do
anything
for
him.
therefore
this
motion
reads,
a
permission
is
asked
to
this
honorable
court
to
permit
chauvenet's
attorney
mr.
link
to
determine
whether
it's
necessary
to
file
supplemental
motions
on
chauvenet's
behalf.
and
that
a
minimum
of
30
days
delay
be
granted
in
order
for
defense
counsel
to
properly
study
and
evaluate
the
record
already
taken
in
these
matters
in
order
to
file
such
pleadings
as
may
be
necessary
in
behalf
of
your
defendant
and
he
asked
the
court
to
enable
him
to
do
justice
to
chauvenet
to
furnish
him
with
the
transcript
of
all
the
pleadings
and
testimony
which
had
been
taken
in
the
case.
at
very
day,
the
trial
judge
ordered
the
court
reporter
to
furnish
mr.
link
with
the
whole,
the
entire
transcript
of
the
proceedings
that
had
gone
before.
he
ordered
the
court
that
the
trial
delayed
for
at
least
30
days
to
permit
mr.
link
to
file
similar
pleadings
on
behalf
of
chauvenet.
in
fact,
the
trial
was
delayed
60
days
because
a
continuance
is
what
we're
asked
for
after
that.
so
mr.
link
had
all
the
transcript
of
the
testimony,
all
of
the
motions.
he
filed
not
one
single
thing
on
behalf
of
chauvenet.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
did
two
things
which
show
clearly
that
he
didn't
think
his
client
had
been
prejudiced
by
what
went
before
three
things.
and
that
he
sort
of
adopted
the
proceedings
as
they
were
on
the
basis
that
chauvenet's
rights
had
been
fully
protected.
these
are
the
things
he
did.
on
the
first
day
of
trial,
mr.
link
moved,
the
record
all
show
this,
as
the
trial
was
about
to
proceed,
mr.
link
asked
the
court
that
all
motions
previously
filed
and
all
bills
of
exception
reserved
be
allowed
to
include
his
client
chauvenet.
the
court
ordered
that
it
should
be.
anyway,
under
louisiana
law,
joint
defendants,
when
one
reserves
the
bill,
they
automatically
go.
he
asked
that
all
his
motions
be
attributed
to
chauvenet.
the
court
ordered
it
done.
moreover,
as
your
honors
will
see
in
the
written
bills
themselves,
they
filed
first
written
bills
which
were
reserved
to
the
overruling
of
these
preliminary
motions
all
recite.
during
the
trial
of
this
case,
skinner,
gueldner,
and
chauvenet
filed
motion
to
quash,
motion
for
preliminary
hearing
which
were
overruled
and
we
reserve
these
bills.
ms.
louise
korns
yes.
ms.
louise
korns
louisiana
law.
ms.
louise
korns
not
motion
your
honor,
bill
of
exception.
ms.
louise
korns
yes
but
mr.
link
here
adopted
all
the
motions
of
the
fail
to
file
of
these
--
never
objected
before
trial
that
his
client
had
been
in
anyway
prejudiced.
in
fact,
how
could
he
when
he'd
been
given
all
these
stuff.
not
only
that,
he
used
the
transcript
of
the
pre-trial
proceedings
to
attempt
to
impeach
witnesses
at
the
trial.
now,
louisiana's
position
is
this.
it
was
too
bad
that
chauvenet
wasn't
at
those
preliminary
hearings.
we
can
see
that.
but
unless
this
court
is
going
to
hold
that
double
jeopardy
has
set
in
and
that
chauvenet
can
never,
never
be
tried
because
of
this
mishap,
then
how
will
chauvenet
be
put
in
a
better
position
if
this
court
gives
him
a
new
trial
than
he
was
in
already
here.
because
he
had
the
transcript
of
the
proceedings,
all
of
the
pleadings,
he
was
given
60
days
to
file
any
motions
of
his
own.
he
adopted
these
pleadings
as
his
own.
he
used
the
transcript
at
the
trial
to
cross-examine
the
witnesses
any
--
the
two
witnesses
who
appeared
at
these
pre-trial
hearings,
russell
abe
and
fullington
appeared
again
at
the
trial
of
the
case
so
we
don't
have
the
point
of
situation
here
at
all.
we
don't
have
the
point
of
situation
because
the
two
--
the
only
two
witnesses
who
appear
to
these
preliminary
hearings
appeared
at
the
trial
were
cross-examined
by
mr.
link
using
the
testimony
before
trial
to
try
to
impeach
them,
so
louisiana
as
i
said
before
and
will
say
for
the
last
time,
if
this
court
should
give
chauvenet
a
new
trial
because
of
his
absence
and
unfortunate
we
conceded
from
these
preliminary
hearings
after
the
trial
judge
did
everything
in
his
power
to
repair
the
damage
and
mr.
link
never
before
trial
complained
that
his
client
was
injured,
then
louisiana
doesn't
see
how
he
can
be
helped
any
further
unless
this
court
says
it's
double
jeopardy
has
set
in
and
you
can
never
try
this
man.
and
i
will
conclude
your
honor
that
point
unless
some
of
the
members
of
this
court
would
like
a
further
discussion
on
that
particular
point.
ms.
louise
korns
yes,
they
said
that
they
didn't
see
how
chauvenet
had
been
damaged
by
this
point
because
this
motion
was
filed.
i
tell
you
your
honors
a
few
more
little
things
that
are
coming
in
my
mind
since
i
said
i'd
finish
the
argument.
there
was
a
motion
to
suppress
filed
and
i
concede
that
if
this
motion
to
suppress
had
been
a
valid
motion,
we
would
have
problems
here
but
it
turns
out
a
law
of
search
warrant
was
sworn
out
in
this
case
and
the
motion
to
suppress
was
based
on
the
search
warrant.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
motion
to
suppress
fell
flat
on
its
face
because
it
became
immediately
clear
after
a
couple
of
minutes
that
the
motion
is
suppressed
that
the
police
officers
who
had
searched
in
his
motor
mart
under
the
search
warrant
had
found
nothing.
you
see
the
evidence
which
was
introduced
at
the
trial
of
this
case
was
the
marijuana
which
was
bought
by
the
undercover
agents
in
the
transaction
when
--
so
nothing
and
when
the
police
officers
searched
skinner
motor
mart
under
a
search
warrant
after
arresting
these
three
men,
they
found
nothing
in
the
motor
mart.
therefore,
mr.
gill
withdrew
his
motion
to
suppress
because
it
became
moot.
there
was
nothing
to
suppress.
so
the
absence
of
chauvenet,
the
fact
i
concede
that
if
a
motion
to
suppress
was
filed
in
the
case
involving
three
joint
defendants
and
one
of
them
wasn't
present
there
and
the
evidence
was
later
introduced
against
him
at
the
trial,
i
concede
that
we
would
have
a
problem
but
that
didn't
happen
here.
so
the
preliminary
hearing
that
was
held
applied
only
to
skinner
and
gueldner
and
whether
louisiana
had
made
out
a
prima
facie
case
bind
them
over
for
trial.
it
didn't
affect
chauvenet
at
all.
and
the
fact
that
chauvenet
wasn't
present
at
these
earlier
meeting
as
louisiana's
position
as
we've
said
was
unfortunate
but
we
feel
that
trial
judge
did
everything
in
his
power
to
repair
this
as
much
as
anything
which
is
done
can
be
repaired
and
that
chauvenet
couldn't
be
in
any
better
position
in
a
new
trial
that
he
was
in
here
because
of
what
the
judge
did
before
trial
to
bring
him
up
to
day
as
it
were,
give
him
time
for
pleadings
and
everything
to
file
in
his
own.
now,
i'll
go
on
to
the
discussion
of
the
late
hours
of
trial,
if
your
honors
please.
ms.
louise
korns
skinner
and
gueldner,
yes
your
honor.
ms.
louise
korns
oh!
no,
mr.
link
has
done
very
well
with
mr.
chauvenet.
represented
him
very
well
and
i
think
mr.
link
was
right.
i
mean,
there
was
no
reason
to
file
any
of
these
extra
motions
on
chauvenet's
behalf
because
he
had
all
the
pleadings,
he
had
all
the
testimony,
he
had
everything
which
the
other
accused
had
gotten
in
the
pre-trial.
for
the
purposes
of
discovery,
you
might
say,
he
kind
of
knew
the
state's
case
because
of
the
testimony
he
had
taken
on
the
preliminary
examination
so
forth
and
that's
clearly
why
he
didn't
go
and
just
re-file
the
same
motions
on
behalf
of
chauvenet
which
i
imagine
that's
why.
now,
as
far
as
the
late
hours
of
trial
ago,
your
honors,
louisiana's
position
on
this
is
that
we
just
don't
feel
like
a
two-day
trial
like
this.
the
jury
wasn't
--
they
didn't
finish
selecting
the
jury
until
around
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
on
the
first
day
of
the
trial
march
21st.
then
testimony
was
heard
until
around
six
and
there
was
two-hour
recess
for
dinner
there
about,
so
the
jury
came
back
around
eight.
the
state
put
on
its
case,
the
rest
of
the
night
until
midnight.
at
about
11:30,
the
state
rested.
and
this
is
the
time
which
mr.
gill
asked
for
a
continuance
in
the
case.
the
trial
--
ms.
louise
korns
well,
a
recess
because
until
the
next
morning,
yes
your
honor.
the
trial
judge
said,
“no,
mr.
gill.
let's
finish
with
the
evidence
tonight.”
then
the
defense
took
a
recess
of
35
minutes,
came
back
in
and
put
on
his
case
until
quarter
to
three.
at
quarter
to
three,
defense
rested.
ms.
louise
korns
i'll
say,
let's
say
that
it's
not
an
everyday
occurrence
but
it's
not
all
that
unusual
specially
this
judge
becker
likes
to
keep
his
docket
going
and
--
ms.
louise
korns
yes,
he
does
and
there
have
been
lots
of
continuances
in
this
case.
mr.
gill
had
gotten
lots
of
continuances
as
you'll
see
from
the
dialogue
between
judge
becker
and
mr.
gill
his
judge
becker
said
to
mr.
gill,
“mr.
gill,
you
got
a
continuance
after
a
continuance
in
this
case,
we're
going
to
finish
this
matter
today.”
and
so
i'm
sure
--
ms.
louise
korns
yes,
your
honor,
it
was.
ms.
louise
korns
yes,
i
don't
think
that
--
ms.
louise
korns
he
asked,
he
actually
--
i
think
he
did
object
to
the
time
but
i
don't
think
that's
been
one
of
the
things
that
they
have
been
complaining
about
in
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
here.
he's
been
complaining
that
he
wasn't
given
his
recess
actually.
he's
been
complaining
that
he
was
sick
and
that
he
was
ineffective
counsel
because
he
wasn't
given
his
recess.
ms.
louise
korns
well,
the
trial
judge
--
ms.
louise
korns
well,
the
thing
is
that
--
things
--
ms.
louise
korns
i
wouldn't
for
one
night
your
honor.
for
one
night,
i
mean,
for
law
examinations,
for
all
kind
of
things
you
go
through
these
things,
i
would
say
definitely.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
your
honors
can
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
getting
just
about
six
hours
sleep
just
one
night
if
anything
is
sort
of
some
stimulates
you
sometime
you're
in
the
middle
of
the
trial.
this
trial
ended
the
next
day.
ms.
louise
korns
that
mr.
gill
had
been
sick,
he
did.
mr.
gill,
the
record
shows
and
judge
becker
knows
that
mr.
gill
has
been
chronically
--
mr.
gill
has
been
chronically
ill
but
not
seriously
ill
since
1954.
this
case
at
argue
had
been
continued
several
times
because
mr.
gill
was
in
the
hospital.
he
was
in
the
hospital,
he
goes
in
and
out
of
the
hospital
because
he
has
chronic
conditions,
nevertheless,
he
functions,
he
doesn't
want
to
give
up
his
law
practice
and
he
does
a
very
good
job
like
in
this
case
as
your
honors
will
see.
he
put
on
17
witnesses
and
he
cross-examined
those
witnesses
in
detail
and
mr.
link
was
sitting
there
by
him
the
whole
time
and
he
never
asked
mr.
link
to
help
him.
mr.
link
got
up
and
made
a
few
you
know
cross-examines
some
witnesses
of
his
own
but
mr.
gill
cross-examined
them
all
them
and
then
when
the
judge
recessed
the
trial
at
3:30
and
said
come
back
at
9:30
the
next
morning,
nobody
complained
that
they
wanted
more
sleep
and
said,
“please
don't
make
us
come
back
at
till
10:30,
11:30
or
12.”
nobody
complained.
the
next
morning,
although
mr.
gill
claims
six
months
later
that
he'd
been
sick
that
night,
he
didn't
call
his
doctor.
his
doctor
has
been
his
doctor
since
1954.
he
could
have
called
him
in
that
35-minute
recess
that
night.
he
didn't
call
him.
he
didn't
bring
him
into
court
the
next
morning.
he
showed
up,
argued
for
an
hour
and
a
half
to
the
jury.
the
jury
deliberated
for
two
and
a
half
hours
then
nobody
made
any
objection
to
sleeping
jurors.
nobody
said
anything
about
it.
nobody
noticed
it.
but
on
motion
for
new
trial
after
the
conviction,
then
mr.
gill
comes
in
and
says,
“i
was
sick,
the
jurors
was
sleeping.”
the
hearing
was
held
six
months
later
and
that's
when
mr.
gill
brought
in
the
doctor
and
say,
“how
sick
he'd
been
that
night?”
now
--
ms.
louise
korns
well,
the
judge
knew
he
was
chronically
sick,
your
honor.
but
if
a
lawyer
has
a
chronic
condition
like
mr.
gill
in
diabetes
and
functions
all
the
time,
anyway
--
ms.
louise
korns
if
he's
functioning
alright,
i
mean,
i'm
sure
judge
becker
would
have
called
a
recess
if
he
had
seen
mr.
gill
faltering
but
mr.
gill,
he
ought
to
seem
in
operation.
he's
a
good
lawyer.
i
mean,
he's
vigorous,
he's
--
your
honors
will
see
from
this
record.
he
doesn't
falter
at
all
and
we've
cited
many
cases.
i
know
that
each
case
like
this
sort
of
has
to
stand
on
its
own
facts
but
the
jurisprudence
of
both
the
federal
and
state
court
seems
to
be
that
if
a
lawyer
functions
well,
then
his
client's
rights
have
been
protected.
i
don't
see
how
mr.
gill
could
--
i
don't
see
how
any
lawyer
could
have
done
better
than
mr.
gill
did
here.
i
admit
that
it
was
hard
on
him
and
probably
hard
on
everybody
but
when
you
put
on
17
witnesses
cross-examined
or
reserve
five
or
six
bills
in
exception,
the
very
bill
that
he
won
the
first
time
before
in
the
louisiana
supreme
court.
ms.
louise
korns
let's
put
it
this
way
your
honor,
the
accused
did
not
take
the
stand
before
the
jury.
ms.
louise
korns
they
were
character
witnesses,
a
lot
of
them,
people
to
show
who
was
at
the
lot.
i
mean,
i
think
your
honors
will
determine
and
when
you
see
this
record
that
these
witnesses
were
cross-examined
as
much
as
and
more
than
had
fitted
in
to
the
situation
of
the
type
of
witnesses
they
were.
in
other
words,
they
were
in
there
to
say
a
lot
of
them
character
witnesses
to
say
they'd
known
mr.
skinner,
mr.
gueldner
and
they
had
no
records
and
so
forth.
each
one,
i
think
the
record
shows
was
very
--
was
exploited
to
the
fullest
of
what
he
could
contribute
to
the
defense
of
this
case.
ms.
louise
korns
yes
sir.
ms.
louise
korns
you
know
the
words
for
the
counsel
--
ms.
louise
korns
yes
well,
during
the
oral
argument
of
course
--
during
the
oral
argument,
i
remember
an
interchange
between
the
court
and
counsel
that
if
they
should
affirm,
give
or
grant
a
new
trial
on
this
point
that
this
couldn't
apply
to
chauvenet
because
his
attorney
was,
you
know
not
sick
and
was
--
but
--
ms.
louise
korns
i
haven't
raised
it
but
right
now
i
do.
ms.
louise
korns
i
neglected
to
urge
it
yes,
i
did.
ms.
louise
korns
yes,
sir.
ms.
louise
korns
your
honor.
ms.
louise
korns
this
was
kind
of
late.
now,
i
think
the
reason
this
happened
--
the
reason
i
think
this
happened
was
that
the
trial
judge
was
afraid
that
if
he
granted
a
continuance
at
12
o'clock
after
the
state
had
put
on
its
case
that
maybe
nobody
would
show
up
the
next
morning.
he'd
have
to
declare
a
mistrial
and
start
all
over
again
because
this
had
been
going
on,
this
was
--
he
had
already
granted
i
think
five
continuance
is
the
record
in
here
shows
and
i
think
he
just
decided
--
now,
this
is
just
my
own
view
that
if
he
granted
a
continuance,
that
if
he
granted
a
recess
before
the
defense
had
put
on
his
case,
after
the
state
had
put
on
its
whole
case
that
he
was
going
to
have
no
counsel
the
next
morning
and
have
to
declare
a
mistrial.
ms.
louise
korns
i
have
heard
of
it
around
the
court
of
some
going
on
all
night,
your
honor.
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
hereon.
no
evidence,
let's
put
it
this
way
--
defense
did
not
make
any
attempt
to
show
by
putting
on
any
kind
of
evidence
and
therefore
the
state
also
did
not
--
to
show
whether
this
was
a
practice
of
how
often
this
had
happened
and
so
forth.
they
just
said
that
they
were
prejudiced
and
we
said
you
were
not
prejudiced.
ms.
louise
korns
well
the
--
ms.
louise
korns
well,
your
honors,
you
know
the
trial
didn't
really
start
her
at
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon.
ms.
louise
korns
they
were
picking
the
jury,
that's
right.
that's
right,
that's
right.
ms.
louise
korns
well,
that's
true,
that's
true.
but
remember
your
honors,
mr.
gill
had
mr.
link
here
with
him
and
your
honors
will
see
that
mr.
gill
did
nine-tenths
of
the
trial
work.
now,
--
ms.
louise
korns
no,
i
don't
know.
it
was
the
21st
and
22nd
of
march
in
1966
so
we
can
find
that
out.
but
now
the
state
believes
that
if
mr.
gill
had
really
been
sick,
why
didn't
he
call
his
doctor
that
night?
why
didn't
he
ask
for
a
longer
recess
and
from
three
in
the
morning,
quarter
to
three
until
9:30
the
next
morning?
why
didn't
he
show
up
the
next
morning
with
the
doctor?
why
was
he
able
to
act
so
vigorously
in
defending
his
clients,
in
arguing
to
the
jury,
and
reserving
bills,
everything
that
a
lawyer
should
do?
ms.
louise
korns
no
but
he
could
have
acted
--
he
could
have
acted
inadequate.
he
could
have
--
now
you
know,
your
honors.
ms.
louise
korns
yes,
those
things
they
say
he
forgot
to
prove
were
completely
immaterial
like
what
call
them
the
marijuana
statute
in
--
ms.
louise
korns
your
honors,
the
way
you
read
this
record
when
chauvenet
says
the
marijuana
is
in
that
car.
he
doesn't
say
the
marijuana
is
in
skinner's
car
and
he
just
says
i
put
behind
--
like
i
put
it
behind
the
bush
someplace.
ms.
louise
korns
see
there's
no
--
there's
no
--
the
state
didn't
attempt
to
prove
it
that
the
car
was
skinner's.
you
see,
i
mean
it
was
just
a
car
where
the
marijuana
was
found.
nobody
attempted
to
prove.
this
isn't
one
of
the
items
of
proof
against
skinner
that
it
was
found
in
his
car.
there's
no
evidence
here
to
show
it
was
skinner's
car
as
far
as
i
see.
ms.
louise
korns
no,
your
honor
i
don't.
i
--
i've
talked
to
lawyers.
i
was
just
talking
last
night
to
a
lawyer
who
practices
law
in
maryland
and
tells
me
that
it's
not
at
all
exceptional
for
trials
there
to
go
on
until
all
night
even
now
this
doesn't
happen
night
after
night
but
when
you
get
a
trial
started
and
you
got
in
the
jury
there
and
the
states
put
on
and
part
of
the
case
has
been
put
on,
they
generally
go
on
through.
ms.
louise
korns
well,
this
was
just
a
conversation
i
had.
you
know,
as
i
say
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
one
way
or
the
other
to
show
how
this
fits
in
with
common
practice
and
there
whole
argument
was
that
they
weren't
able
to
effective
counsel,
our
whole
argument
was
that
the
record
showed
you
were
effective
and
we
can't
see
how
counsel
could
be
more
effective.
ms.
louise
korns
let's
get
on
to
the
third
point,
alright.
ms.
louise
korns
no.
it's
not
at
all
the
fact.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
defense
would
like
you
to
think
that
the
judge
was
confused
but
the
judge
wasn't
at
all
confused
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
he
hadn't
charged
the
jury
on
the
law
of
conspiracy,
the
accused
would
have
been
prejudiced
for
this
reason.
these
three
men
were
jointly
charged
with
sale
and
possession
of
marijuana.
now,
the
actual
delivery
of
the
marijuana
to
the
undercover
agents
took
place
just
by
chauvenet
although
skinner
and
gueldner
were
on
the
lot
and
introduced
the
undercover
agents
to
chauvenet,
they
were
not
there
when
the
marijuana
was
actually
handed
to
him.
therefore,
during
the
trial
of
the
case,
mr.
gill
objected
when
say,
agent
fullington,
agent
abe
there
was
testifying
as
to
how
he
bought,
how
they
bought
the
marijuana
from
chauvenet.
mr.
gill
objected
your
honor.
this
act
is
inadmissible.
it
took
place
out
of
the
presence
of
my
client.
well,
certainly
this
is
a
good
argument
if
there's
just
one
defendant
being
tried
because
as
your
honors
know,
he
can
only
introduced
against
an
accused
statements
all
acts
that
were
done
in
his
presence.
but
the
exception
to
this
rule,
the
recognized
exception
in
all
jurisdictions
is
that
if
a
conspiracy
is
involved
in
the
case,
you
can
introduce
acts
of
any
of
the
conspirators
and
if
that
the
jury
finds
that
a
conspiracy
existed,
it's
imputable
to
everybody.
in
other
words,
three
people
could
decide
to
murder
or
rob
and
one
person
to
stay
home
the
whole
time
and
the
other
one
go
out
and
do
it,
if
you
could
prove
that
they
conspire
to
do
this,
the
person
who
stayed
home
would
be
just
as
guilty
as
the
murder
or
so
forth
as
the
person
who
went
to
do
the
murder.
so
in
the
instant
case,
the
trial
judge
allowed
in
this
evidence
of
acts
which
took
place
out
of
skinner
and
gueldner's
presence,
allowed
it
in
because
the
state,
the
judge's
rule
had
made
a
prima
facie
showing
of
conspiracy.
that
a
conspiracy
existed
between
these
three
accused.
now,
when
the
trial
judge
came
to
charge
the
jury,
he
told
them
very
--
ms.
louise
korns
yes,
that
he
told
the
jury
--
he
told
them
about
the
law
of
conspiracy
and
then
he
said,
set
out
on
page
28
of
louisiana's
brief,
“unless
you're
satisfied
that
a
conspiracy
has
been
established,
i
charge
you
that
the
acts
and
declarations
of
one
other
parties
to
the
alleged
conspiracy
do
not
bind
the
others.”
therefore,
the
state
feels
that
he
was
protecting,
in
fact
the
state
knows
that
he
was
protecting
the
rights
of
skinner
and
gueldner
when
he
told
them
this.
because
if
he
hadn't
told
the
jury
this
it
would
have
been
the
trial
judge
you
would
have
decided
that
a
conspiracy
existed.
the
trial
judge
would
have
been
allowed
evidence
of
the
acts
of
chauvenet
out
of
the
presence
of
skinner
and
gueldner
and
it
would
have
had
--
it
would
not
have
left
it
up
to
the
jury
whether
to
impute
these
acts
of
skinner
and
gueldner
or
not.
ms.
louise
korns
no
sir
but
it's
well-settled
in
louisiana
and
in
other
jurisdictions
that
the
--
that
when
you
indict
two
or
more
persons,
a
conspiracy
is
involved
in
--
ms.
louise
korns
it
really
is
to
govern
the
laws
of
evidence
your
honor.
it's
because
for
this
very
reason
that
i've
said
so
that
you
can
--
because
otherwise,
you
couldn't
--
because
if
three
people
commit
a
crime
altogether
at
all
times,
you
don't
have
this
problem.
but
if
more
than
two
people
--
if
two
or
more
people
commit
a
crime,
generally,
they
are
not
together
all
the
time.
and
unless
you
have
this
law
governing
the
introduction
of
evidence
which
permits,
which
says
that
the
acts
in
declarations
of
a
conspirator
are
deemed
to
be
consented
to
by
his
co-conspirators
whether
he
was
present
or
not.
ms.
louise
korns
had
judge
becker?
ms.
louise
korns
yes,
judge
becker
was
elected
i
think
about
three
years
ago.
ms.
louise
korns
he's
--
i
think
he
would
say
in
his
60's
judge
black.
i
would
say
in
his
early
60's.
he
was
a
criminal
lawyer
before
that
for
a
long
time.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
he's
argued
cases
before
this
court
and
he
was
elected
well,
let's
say
three
--
two
to
four
years
ago.
ms.
louise
korns
yes.
ms.
louise
korns
the
judge
does
unless
it
say
guilty
as
charged.
we
have
in
capital
cases
than
the
jury
can
bring
in
two
verdicts,
guilty
as
charged
or
guilty
without
capital
punishment.
both
of
those
i
think
are
set
because
guilt
without
capital
punishment
means
life
imprisonment.
under
say
this
particular
case?
ms.
louise
korns
the
judge
has
a
range
of
sentences
set
out
by
the
statute
that
defines
the
crime
of
illegal
possession
of
drugs
says
that
anyone
and
depending
on
the
age
of
the
person
who
sells
and
the
age
person
who
receives
it
whether
it's
selling
or
possessing,
the
sentence
ranges
from
say
i
think
say
the
minimum
for
sale
is
ten
years,
the
minimum
for
possession
is
five
years
and
the
maximum
set
out
also.
ms.
louise
korns
that's
on
the
double,
that's
because
he
was
double
billed
or
even
triple
billed.
ms.
louise
korns
well,
double
billing
again
in
specially
for
selling,
i
think
double
billing,
that
might
have
been
a
minimum
sentence.
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
ms.
louise
korns
well,
this
was
because
he
was
double
billed.
you
see
that
means
--
ms.
louise
korns
double
billed.
this
means,
you
know,
i
think
you
all
call
it
repeat
of
statutes.
ms.
louise
korns
no,
sir.
it
means
that
when
--
ms.
louise
korns
he
had
a
record,
that's
right
within
--
that's
it.
ms.
louise
korns
habitual
offense.
ms.
louise
korns
yes,
within
a
certain
number
of
years
of
that
conviction
and
this
record
here
will
show
that
the
bill
of
information
that
we
call
double
billing
goes
in
and
recites
that
on
such
and
such
a
day,
maybe
it
was
twice.
i
don't
know
whether
this
was
a
third
or
second
time
the
accused
was
found
guilty
and
generally
has
to
be
within
a
time
and
it
has
to
be
a
felony
and
so
forth
that
such
an
offense.
and
then
under
the
statute
setting
out
the
habitual
offender
sentences,
the
sentences
get
pretty
stiff
under
these.
well,
there
are
some
armed
robbery
statutes
that
you
know
go
up
almost
to
life
imprisonment
if
you
keep
on
by
the
third
offender
or
so
forth.
but
this
10
years
you
see
skinner
and
gueldner
for
the
same
offense
got
10
years,
i
think
if
i'm
not
wrong
that
chauvenet
was
a
third
offender.
he
might
just
have
been
the
second
offender
but
it
was
certainly
because
of
that.
ms.
louise
korns
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
if
your
honors
look
at
the
statutes
in
the
record,
i
don't
think
the
--
it
may
be
that
it
was
the
minimum
that
the
judge
could
give
under
the
number
of
previous
offenses
which
had
been
--
which
he
was
guilty.
ms.
louise
korns
thank
you,
your
honors.
ms.
louise
korns
yes
,sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
before
beginning
the
argument,
i'd
like
to
inquire
if
the
court
--
is
the
court
interested
in
this
third
point
on
which
it
grants
certiorari,
the
conspiracy
charge
to
the
jury
or
is
this
court
interested
only
in
the
two
points
which
petitioners
have
briefed?
when
this
court
granted
certiorari,
three
points
were
presented
to
this
court
as
allegations
are
there
in
the
court
below.
one
of
them
was
that
the
trial
judge
charged
the
jury
in
this
case
on
the
law
of
conspiracy
although
conspiracy
was
not
formerly
charged
in
the
bill
of
information.
now,
although
petitioners
urged
this
strongly
in
their
application
for
certiorari
in
their
brief
in
this
court,
they
don't
brief
this
point.
they
say
they
don't
think
this
court
is
interested
in
it.
now,
we
briefed
it
very
strongly,
however,
if
this
court
is
not
interested
in
it,
naturally,
louisiana
will
not
argue
it.
ms.
louise
korns
very
well,
your
honors.
i'll
answer
three
of
the
points
then.
as
far
as
the
facts
of
the
case
go,
i'll
just
briefly
recapitulate
what
mr.
leppert
said
that
this
charge
grows
out
of
a
may
21st
sale
of
heroin
on
skinner's
motor
lot,
motor
mart
to
state
undercover
agent
ben
fullington.
the
test
--
undercover
agent
fullington
testified
that
he
went
to
skinner's
motor
mart
that
day,
met
skinner
and
gueldner,
told
him
that
he
was
interested
in
getting
some
marijuana
that
either
skinner
or
gueldner
place
to
telephone
call,
told
the
undercover
agent
he
could
have
the
marijuana
later
that
day.
fullington
testified
that
he
return
to
the
motor
mart
around
8
that
evening
was
introduced
by
either
skinner
or
gueldner
to
chauvenet.
the
third
accused
in
this
case,
that
chauvenet
told
the
agent
the
stuff
as
they
call
the
marijuana
is
in
that
white
lincoln
parked
on
the
lot.
that
fullington
went
and
got
a
matchbox
of
marijuana
out
of
the
lincoln
and
paid
chauvenet
$20.00.
now,
a
week
later
on
the
28th
of
may,
undercover
agent
russell
abe
who
was
working
in
close
collaboration
with
ben
fullington
on
this
case,
the
testimony
shows
that
on
this
week
later
that
gueldner
phoned
russell
abe
and
told
him
that
the
connection
that
he'd
spoken
to
him
about
was
that
the
lot
and
that
would
sell
him
marijuana
that
russell
abe
went
to
the
lot
and
was
introduced
to
chauvenet
on
this
date
a
week
later.
chauvenet
took
him
into
an
office,
sold
him
nine
marijuana
cigarettes.
gueldner
also
testified
that
he
had
told
gueldner
--
i
mean
russell
abe
also
testified
that
he
told
gueldner
a
day
or
so
beforew
this
meeting,
that
he
was
interested
in
contacts
that
would
sell
the
heroin
or
marijuana.
on
this
second
date,
may
28,
after
chauvenet
had
sold
abe
the
nine
marijuana
cigarettes
in
the
office
at
the
motor
lot,
he
said,
“how
about
some
heroin?”
and
chauvenet
said,
“i'll
get
you
some,
let's
get
in
my
car.”
they
went
in
chauvenet's
car
to
a
spot
away
from
the
motor
mart.
there,
chauvenet
obtained
some
heroin
which
he
sold
to
gueldner
then
on
chauvenet's
instructions,
gueldner
drove
chauvenet
back
to
skinner's
lot.
on
this
date,
skinner
and
gueldner
were
at
the
lot.
gueldner
had
spoken
to
them
about
getting
heroin
and
after
the
sale
of
heroin,
chauvenet
was
taken
at
chauvenet's
direction
back
to
skinner's
lot.
now,
louisiana
will
first
discuss
the
absence
of
chauvenet
from
the
preliminary
motions
filed
at
the
hearing
of
the
preliminary
motions
filed
by
the
other
two
accused.
these
three
men
were
arrested
on
july
30th.
skinner
and
gueldner
employed
mr.
gill
to
represent.
chauvenet
appeared
with
the
other
two
for
arraignment,
had
no
lawyer.
the
court
entered
a
plea
of
not
guilty
for
him,
told
him
to
return
in
a
few
days
to
determine
counsel.
the
september
--
the
betsy
storm
came
in
there
somewhere,
anyway,
because
the
court
proceedings
were
delayed
but
anyway
the
court
appointed
the
first
lawyer
to
represent
chauvenet
sometime
around
at
the
end
of
september.
unlike
the
allegation,
contrary
to
the
contention
made
by
my
opponents,
a
year
did
not
elapse
between
the
arrest
of
chauvenet
and
his
retention
of
mr.
link
here,
six
months
elapsed.
chauvenet
was
arrested
around
the
first
of
august,
that
is
on
the
30th
of
july.
he
retained
mr.
link
on
the
18th
of
january
of
the
following
year.
during
that
six
months
period,
the
court
appointed
three
lawyers
for
mr.
chauvenet.
none
of
them
did
anything
for
him.
however,
mr.
link
concedes
in
his
motion
that
he
filed
later
which
i
will
refer
later
that
it
was
because
of
illness.
in
fact,
one
of
them
died,
mr.
bentley
burns
who
was
a
prominent
lawyer.
i
don't
know
mr.
joseph
mooney
myself,
the
first
lawyer
appointed
but
i
do
know
that
mr.
bentley
burns
and
mr.
morris
burke
are
competent
lawyers
that
--
who
take
care
of
their
clients
there.
the
allegation
is
that
they
were
sick.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
they
were
not
sick.
ms.
louise
korns
no,
sir.
there's
nothing
your
honor
that
our
only
position
is
--
ms.
louise
korns
the
only
position
is
that
the
judge
says,
you
come
back
and
then
committed
it
to
jail.
ms.
louise
korns
our
position
is
this
mr.
justice
that
chauvenet
had
a
lawyer
all
this
time.
because
of
illness
these
lawyers
could
not
--
did
not
file
pleadings
on
his
behalf
nor
did
skinner
and
gueldner
notify
chauvenet
or
his
lawyers
that
they
had
filed
these
motions.
now,
right
off
louisiana
will
concede
that
it
would
have
been
better
if
chauvenet
had
been
in
present
at
those
pre-trial
hearings
of
skinner
and
gueldner.
there's
no
doubt
about
it.
our
position
is
if
this
court
should
give
chauvenet
a
new
trial
because
of
this
--
his
absence
from
these
motions,
he
would
be
on
no
better
position
than
the
trial
judge
placed
him
in
at
this
trial
for
this
reason.
these
hearings
were
held
on
behalf
of
skinner
and
gueldner.
before
the
trial,
60
days
before
the
trial,
chauvenet
engaged
mr.
link
to
represent
him.
on
--
mr.
link
went
into
court
at
this
time
and
filed
a
motion
set
out
on
page
11
of
louisiana's
brief.
a
written
motion
in
which
mr.
link
said
pointed
out
to
the
court
that
because
of
illness,
the
three
lawyers
whom
the
court
had
appointed
to
represent
chauvenet
had
been
unable
to
do
anything
for
him.
therefore
this
motion
reads,
a
permission
is
asked
to
this
honorable
court
to
permit
chauvenet's
attorney
mr.
link
to
determine
whether
it's
necessary
to
file
supplemental
motions
on
chauvenet's
behalf.
and
that
a
minimum
of
30
days
delay
be
granted
in
order
for
defense
counsel
to
properly
study
and
evaluate
the
record
already
taken
in
these
matters
in
order
to
file
such
pleadings
as
may
be
necessary
in
behalf
of
your
defendant
and
he
asked
the
court
to
enable
him
to
do
justice
to
chauvenet
to
furnish
him
with
the
transcript
of
all
the
pleadings
and
testimony
which
had
been
taken
in
the
case.
at
very
day,
the
trial
judge
ordered
the
court
reporter
to
furnish
mr.
link
with
the
whole,
the
entire
transcript
of
the
proceedings
that
had
gone
before.
he
ordered
the
court
that
the
trial
delayed
for
at
least
30
days
to
permit
mr.
link
to
file
similar
pleadings
on
behalf
of
chauvenet.
in
fact,
the
trial
was
delayed
60
days
because
a
continuance
is
what
we're
asked
for
after
that.
so
mr.
link
had
all
the
transcript
of
the
testimony,
all
of
the
motions.
he
filed
not
one
single
thing
on
behalf
of
chauvenet.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
did
two
things
which
show
clearly
that
he
didn't
think
his
client
had
been
prejudiced
by
what
went
before
three
things.
and
that
he
sort
of
adopted
the
proceedings
as
they
were
on
the
basis
that
chauvenet's
rights
had
been
fully
protected.
these
are
the
things
he
did.
on
the
first
day
of
trial,
mr.
link
moved,
the
record
all
show
this,
as
the
trial
was
about
to
proceed,
mr.
link
asked
the
court
that
all
motions
previously
filed
and
all
bills
of
exception
reserved
be
allowed
to
include
his
client
chauvenet.
the
court
ordered
that
it
should
be.
anyway,
under
louisiana
law,
joint
defendants,
when
one
reserves
the
bill,
they
automatically
go.
he
asked
that
all
his
motions
be
attributed
to
chauvenet.
the
court
ordered
it
done.
moreover,
as
your
honors
will
see
in
the
written
bills
themselves,
they
filed
first
written
bills
which
were
reserved
to
the
overruling
of
these
preliminary
motions
all
recite.
during
the
trial
of
this
case,
skinner,
gueldner,
and
chauvenet
filed
motion
to
quash,
motion
for
preliminary
hearing
which
were
overruled
and
we
reserve
these
bills.
ms.
louise
korns
yes.
ms.
louise
korns
louisiana
law.
ms.
louise
korns
not
motion
your
honor,
bill
of
exception.
ms.
louise
korns
yes
but
mr.
link
here
adopted
all
the
motions
of
the
fail
to
file
of
these
--
never
objected
before
trial
that
his
client
had
been
in
anyway
prejudiced.
in
fact,
how
could
he
when
he'd
been
given
all
these
stuff.
not
only
that,
he
used
the
transcript
of
the
pre-trial
proceedings
to
attempt
to
impeach
witnesses
at
the
trial.
now,
louisiana's
position
is
this.
it
was
too
bad
that
chauvenet
wasn't
at
those
preliminary
hearings.
we
can
see
that.
but
unless
this
court
is
going
to
hold
that
double
jeopardy
has
set
in
and
that
chauvenet
can
never,
never
be
tried
because
of
this
mishap,
then
how
will
chauvenet
be
put
in
a
better
position
if
this
court
gives
him
a
new
trial
than
he
was
in
already
here.
because
he
had
the
transcript
of
the
proceedings,
all
of
the
pleadings,
he
was
given
60
days
to
file
any
motions
of
his
own.
he
adopted
these
pleadings
as
his
own.
he
used
the
transcript
at
the
trial
to
cross-examine
the
witnesses
any
--
the
two
witnesses
who
appeared
at
these
pre-trial
hearings,
russell
abe
and
fullington
appeared
again
at
the
trial
of
the
case
so
we
don't
have
the
point
of
situation
here
at
all.
we
don't
have
the
point
of
situation
because
the
two
--
the
only
two
witnesses
who
appear
to
these
preliminary
hearings
appeared
at
the
trial
were
cross-examined
by
mr.
link
using
the
testimony
before
trial
to
try
to
impeach
them,
so
louisiana
as
i
said
before
and
will
say
for
the
last
time,
if
this
court
should
give
chauvenet
a
new
trial
because
of
his
absence
and
unfortunate
we
conceded
from
these
preliminary
hearings
after
the
trial
judge
did
everything
in
his
power
to
repair
the
damage
and
mr.
link
never
before
trial
complained
that
his
client
was
injured,
then
louisiana
doesn't
see
how
he
can
be
helped
any
further
unless
this
court
says
it's
double
jeopardy
has
set
in
and
you
can
never
try
this
man.
and
i
will
conclude
your
honor
that
point
unless
some
of
the
members
of
this
court
would
like
a
further
discussion
on
that
particular
point.
ms.
louise
korns
yes,
they
said
that
they
didn't
see
how
chauvenet
had
been
damaged
by
this
point
because
this
motion
was
filed.
i
tell
you
your
honors
a
few
more
little
things
that
are
coming
in
my
mind
since
i
said
i'd
finish
the
argument.
there
was
a
motion
to
suppress
filed
and
i
concede
that
if
this
motion
to
suppress
had
been
a
valid
motion,
we
would
have
problems
here
but
it
turns
out
a
law
of
search
warrant
was
sworn
out
in
this
case
and
the
motion
to
suppress
was
based
on
the
search
warrant.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
motion
to
suppress
fell
flat
on
its
face
because
it
became
immediately
clear
after
a
couple
of
minutes
that
the
motion
is
suppressed
that
the
police
officers
who
had
searched
in
his
motor
mart
under
the
search
warrant
had
found
nothing.
you
see
the
evidence
which
was
introduced
at
the
trial
of
this
case
was
the
marijuana
which
was
bought
by
the
undercover
agents
in
the
transaction
when
--
so
nothing
and
when
the
police
officers
searched
skinner
motor
mart
under
a
search
warrant
after
arresting
these
three
men,
they
found
nothing
in
the
motor
mart.
therefore,
mr.
gill
withdrew
his
motion
to
suppress
because
it
became
moot.
there
was
nothing
to
suppress.
so
the
absence
of
chauvenet,
the
fact
i
concede
that
if
a
motion
to
suppress
was
filed
in
the
case
involving
three
joint
defendants
and
one
of
them
wasn't
present
there
and
the
evidence
was
later
introduced
against
him
at
the
trial,
i
concede
that
we
would
have
a
problem
but
that
didn't
happen
here.
so
the
preliminary
hearing
that
was
held
applied
only
to
skinner
and
gueldner
and
whether
louisiana
had
made
out
a
prima
facie
case
bind
them
over
for
trial.
it
didn't
affect
chauvenet
at
all.
and
the
fact
that
chauvenet
wasn't
present
at
these
earlier
meeting
as
louisiana's
position
as
we've
said
was
unfortunate
but
we
feel
that
trial
judge
did
everything
in
his
power
to
repair
this
as
much
as
anything
which
is
done
can
be
repaired
and
that
chauvenet
couldn't
be
in
any
better
position
in
a
new
trial
that
he
was
in
here
because
of
what
the
judge
did
before
trial
to
bring
him
up
to
day
as
it
were,
give
him
time
for
pleadings
and
everything
to
file
in
his
own.
now,
i'll
go
on
to
the
discussion
of
the
late
hours
of
trial,
if
your
honors
please.
ms.
louise
korns
skinner
and
gueldner,
yes
your
honor.
ms.
louise
korns
oh!
no,
mr.
link
has
done
very
well
with
mr.
chauvenet.
represented
him
very
well
and
i
think
mr.
link
was
right.
i
mean,
there
was
no
reason
to
file
any
of
these
extra
motions
on
chauvenet's
behalf
because
he
had
all
the
pleadings,
he
had
all
the
testimony,
he
had
everything
which
the
other
accused
had
gotten
in
the
pre-trial.
for
the
purposes
of
discovery,
you
might
say,
he
kind
of
knew
the
state's
case
because
of
the
testimony
he
had
taken
on
the
preliminary
examination
so
forth
and
that's
clearly
why
he
didn't
go
and
just
re-file
the
same
motions
on
behalf
of
chauvenet
which
i
imagine
that's
why.
now,
as
far
as
the
late
hours
of
trial
ago,
your
honors,
louisiana's
position
on
this
is
that
we
just
don't
feel
like
a
two-day
trial
like
this.
the
jury
wasn't
--
they
didn't
finish
selecting
the
jury
until
around
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
on
the
first
day
of
the
trial
march
21st.
then
testimony
was
heard
until
around
six
and
there
was
two-hour
recess
for
dinner
there
about,
so
the
jury
came
back
around
eight.
the
state
put
on
its
case,
the
rest
of
the
night
until
midnight.
at
about
11:30,
the
state
rested.
and
this
is
the
time
which
mr.
gill
asked
for
a
continuance
in
the
case.
the
trial
--
ms.
louise
korns
well,
a
recess
because
until
the
next
morning,
yes
your
honor.
the
trial
judge
said,
“no,
mr.
gill.
let's
finish
with
the
evidence
tonight.”
then
the
defense
took
a
recess
of
35
minutes,
came
back
in
and
put
on
his
case
until
quarter
to
three.
at
quarter
to
three,
defense
rested.
ms.
louise
korns
i'll
say,
let's
say
that
it's
not
an
everyday
occurrence
but
it's
not
all
that
unusual
specially
this
judge
becker
likes
to
keep
his
docket
going
and
--
ms.
louise
korns
yes,
he
does
and
there
have
been
lots
of
continuances
in
this
case.
mr.
gill
had
gotten
lots
of
continuances
as
you'll
see
from
the
dialogue
between
judge
becker
and
mr.
gill
his
judge
becker
said
to
mr.
gill,
“mr.
gill,
you
got
a
continuance
after
a
continuance
in
this
case,
we're
going
to
finish
this
matter
today.”
and
so
i'm
sure
--
ms.
louise
korns
yes,
your
honor,
it
was.
ms.
louise
korns
yes,
i
don't
think
that
--
ms.
louise
korns
he
asked,
he
actually
--
i
think
he
did
object
to
the
time
but
i
don't
think
that's
been
one
of
the
things
that
they
have
been
complaining
about
in
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
here.
he's
been
complaining
that
he
wasn't
given
his
recess
actually.
he's
been
complaining
that
he
was
sick
and
that
he
was
ineffective
counsel
because
he
wasn't
given
his
recess.
ms.
louise
korns
well,
the
trial
judge
--
ms.
louise
korns
well,
the
thing
is
that
--
things
--
ms.
louise
korns
i
wouldn't
for
one
night
your
honor.
for
one
night,
i
mean,
for
law
examinations,
for
all
kind
of
things
you
go
through
these
things,
i
would
say
definitely.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
your
honors
can
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
getting
just
about
six
hours
sleep
just
one
night
if
anything
is
sort
of
some
stimulates
you
sometime
you're
in
the
middle
of
the
trial.
this
trial
ended
the
next
day.
ms.
louise
korns
that
mr.
gill
had
been
sick,
he
did.
mr.
gill,
the
record
shows
and
judge
becker
knows
that
mr.
gill
has
been
chronically
--
mr.
gill
has
been
chronically
ill
but
not
seriously
ill
since
1954.
this
case
at
argue
had
been
continued
several
times
because
mr.
gill
was
in
the
hospital.
he
was
in
the
hospital,
he
goes
in
and
out
of
the
hospital
because
he
has
chronic
conditions,
nevertheless,
he
functions,
he
doesn't
want
to
give
up
his
law
practice
and
he
does
a
very
good
job
like
in
this
case
as
your
honors
will
see.
he
put
on
17
witnesses
and
he
cross-examined
those
witnesses
in
detail
and
mr.
link
was
sitting
there
by
him
the
whole
time
and
he
never
asked
mr.
link
to
help
him.
mr.
link
got
up
and
made
a
few
you
know
cross-examines
some
witnesses
of
his
own
but
mr.
gill
cross-examined
them
all
them
and
then
when
the
judge
recessed
the
trial
at
3:30
and
said
come
back
at
9:30
the
next
morning,
nobody
complained
that
they
wanted
more
sleep
and
said,
“please
don't
make
us
come
back
at
till
10:30,
11:30
or
12.”
nobody
complained.
the
next
morning,
although
mr.
gill
claims
six
months
later
that
he'd
been
sick
that
night,
he
didn't
call
his
doctor.
his
doctor
has
been
his
doctor
since
1954.
he
could
have
called
him
in
that
35-minute
recess
that
night.
he
didn't
call
him.
he
didn't
bring
him
into
court
the
next
morning.
he
showed
up,
argued
for
an
hour
and
a
half
to
the
jury.
the
jury
deliberated
for
two
and
a
half
hours
then
nobody
made
any
objection
to
sleeping
jurors.
nobody
said
anything
about
it.
nobody
noticed
it.
but
on
motion
for
new
trial
after
the
conviction,
then
mr.
gill
comes
in
and
says,
“i
was
sick,
the
jurors
was
sleeping.”
the
hearing
was
held
six
months
later
and
that's
when
mr.
gill
brought
in
the
doctor
and
say,
“how
sick
he'd
been
that
night?”
now
--
ms.
louise
korns
well,
the
judge
knew
he
was
chronically
sick,
your
honor.
but
if
a
lawyer
has
a
chronic
condition
like
mr.
gill
in
diabetes
and
functions
all
the
time,
anyway
--
ms.
louise
korns
if
he's
functioning
alright,
i
mean,
i'm
sure
judge
becker
would
have
called
a
recess
if
he
had
seen
mr.
gill
faltering
but
mr.
gill,
he
ought
to
seem
in
operation.
he's
a
good
lawyer.
i
mean,
he's
vigorous,
he's
--
your
honors
will
see
from
this
record.
he
doesn't
falter
at
all
and
we've
cited
many
cases.
i
know
that
each
case
like
this
sort
of
has
to
stand
on
its
own
facts
but
the
jurisprudence
of
both
the
federal
and
state
court
seems
to
be
that
if
a
lawyer
functions
well,
then
his
client's
rights
have
been
protected.
i
don't
see
how
mr.
gill
could
--
i
don't
see
how
any
lawyer
could
have
done
better
than
mr.
gill
did
here.
i
admit
that
it
was
hard
on
him
and
probably
hard
on
everybody
but
when
you
put
on
17
witnesses
cross-examined
or
reserve
five
or
six
bills
in
exception,
the
very
bill
that
he
won
the
first
time
before
in
the
louisiana
supreme
court.
ms.
louise
korns
let's
put
it
this
way
your
honor,
the
accused
did
not
take
the
stand
before
the
jury.
ms.
louise
korns
they
were
character
witnesses,
a
lot
of
them,
people
to
show
who
was
at
the
lot.
i
mean,
i
think
your
honors
will
determine
and
when
you
see
this
record
that
these
witnesses
were
cross-examined
as
much
as
and
more
than
had
fitted
in
to
the
situation
of
the
type
of
witnesses
they
were.
in
other
words,
they
were
in
there
to
say
a
lot
of
them
character
witnesses
to
say
they'd
known
mr.
skinner,
mr.
gueldner
and
they
had
no
records
and
so
forth.
each
one,
i
think
the
record
shows
was
very
--
was
exploited
to
the
fullest
of
what
he
could
contribute
to
the
defense
of
this
case.
ms.
louise
korns
yes
sir.
ms.
louise
korns
you
know
the
words
for
the
counsel
--
ms.
louise
korns
yes
well,
during
the
oral
argument
of
course
--
during
the
oral
argument,
i
remember
an
interchange
between
the
court
and
counsel
that
if
they
should
affirm,
give
or
grant
a
new
trial
on
this
point
that
this
couldn't
apply
to
chauvenet
because
his
attorney
was,
you
know
not
sick
and
was
--
but
--
ms.
louise
korns
i
haven't
raised
it
but
right
now
i
do.
ms.
louise
korns
i
neglected
to
urge
it
yes,
i
did.
ms.
louise
korns
yes,
sir.
ms.
louise
korns
your
honor.
ms.
louise
korns
this
was
kind
of
late.
now,
i
think
the
reason
this
happened
--
the
reason
i
think
this
happened
was
that
the
trial
judge
was
afraid
that
if
he
granted
a
continuance
at
12
o'clock
after
the
state
had
put
on
its
case
that
maybe
nobody
would
show
up
the
next
morning.
he'd
have
to
declare
a
mistrial
and
start
all
over
again
because
this
had
been
going
on,
this
was
--
he
had
already
granted
i
think
five
continuance
is
the
record
in
here
shows
and
i
think
he
just
decided
--
now,
this
is
just
my
own
view
that
if
he
granted
a
continuance,
that
if
he
granted
a
recess
before
the
defense
had
put
on
his
case,
after
the
state
had
put
on
its
whole
case
that
he
was
going
to
have
no
counsel
the
next
morning
and
have
to
declare
a
mistrial.
ms.
louise
korns
i
have
heard
of
it
around
the
court
of
some
going
on
all
night,
your
honor.
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
hereon.
no
evidence,
let's
put
it
this
way
--
defense
did
not
make
any
attempt
to
show
by
putting
on
any
kind
of
evidence
and
therefore
the
state
also
did
not
--
to
show
whether
this
was
a
practice
of
how
often
this
had
happened
and
so
forth.
they
just
said
that
they
were
prejudiced
and
we
said
you
were
not
prejudiced.
ms.
louise
korns
well
the
--
ms.
louise
korns
well,
your
honors,
you
know
the
trial
didn't
really
start
her
at
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon.
ms.
louise
korns
they
were
picking
the
jury,
that's
right.
that's
right,
that's
right.
ms.
louise
korns
well,
that's
true,
that's
true.
but
remember
your
honors,
mr.
gill
had
mr.
link
here
with
him
and
your
honors
will
see
that
mr.
gill
did
nine-tenths
of
the
trial
work.
now,
--
ms.
louise
korns
no,
i
don't
know.
it
was
the
21st
and
22nd
of
march
in
1966
so
we
can
find
that
out.
but
now
the
state
believes
that
if
mr.
gill
had
really
been
sick,
why
didn't
he
call
his
doctor
that
night?
why
didn't
he
ask
for
a
longer
recess
and
from
three
in
the
morning,
quarter
to
three
until
9:30
the
next
morning?
why
didn't
he
show
up
the
next
morning
with
the
doctor?
why
was
he
able
to
act
so
vigorously
in
defending
his
clients,
in
arguing
to
the
jury,
and
reserving
bills,
everything
that
a
lawyer
should
do?
ms.
louise
korns
no
but
he
could
have
acted
--
he
could
have
acted
inadequate.
he
could
have
--
now
you
know,
your
honors.
ms.
louise
korns
yes,
those
things
they
say
he
forgot
to
prove
were
completely
immaterial
like
what
call
them
the
marijuana
statute
in
--
ms.
louise
korns
your
honors,
the
way
you
read
this
record
when
chauvenet
says
the
marijuana
is
in
that
car.
he
doesn't
say
the
marijuana
is
in
skinner's
car
and
he
just
says
i
put
behind
--
like
i
put
it
behind
the
bush
someplace.
ms.
louise
korns
see
there's
no
--
there's
no
--
the
state
didn't
attempt
to
prove
it
that
the
car
was
skinner's.
you
see,
i
mean
it
was
just
a
car
where
the
marijuana
was
found.
nobody
attempted
to
prove.
this
isn't
one
of
the
items
of
proof
against
skinner
that
it
was
found
in
his
car.
there's
no
evidence
here
to
show
it
was
skinner's
car
as
far
as
i
see.
ms.
louise
korns
no,
your
honor
i
don't.
i
--
i've
talked
to
lawyers.
i
was
just
talking
last
night
to
a
lawyer
who
practices
law
in
maryland
and
tells
me
that
it's
not
at
all
exceptional
for
trials
there
to
go
on
until
all
night
even
now
this
doesn't
happen
night
after
night
but
when
you
get
a
trial
started
and
you
got
in
the
jury
there
and
the
states
put
on
and
part
of
the
case
has
been
put
on,
they
generally
go
on
through.
ms.
louise
korns
well,
this
was
just
a
conversation
i
had.
you
know,
as
i
say
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
one
way
or
the
other
to
show
how
this
fits
in
with
common
practice
and
there
whole
argument
was
that
they
weren't
able
to
effective
counsel,
our
whole
argument
was
that
the
record
showed
you
were
effective
and
we
can't
see
how
counsel
could
be
more
effective.
ms.
louise
korns
let's
get
on
to
the
third
point,
alright.
ms.
louise
korns
no.
it's
not
at
all
the
fact.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
defense
would
like
you
to
think
that
the
judge
was
confused
but
the
judge
wasn't
at
all
confused
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
he
hadn't
charged
the
jury
on
the
law
of
conspiracy,
the
accused
would
have
been
prejudiced
for
this
reason.
these
three
men
were
jointly
charged
with
sale
and
possession
of
marijuana.
now,
the
actual
delivery
of
the
marijuana
to
the
undercover
agents
took
place
just
by
chauvenet
although
skinner
and
gueldner
were
on
the
lot
and
introduced
the
undercover
agents
to
chauvenet,
they
were
not
there
when
the
marijuana
was
actually
handed
to
him.
therefore,
during
the
trial
of
the
case,
mr.
gill
objected
when
say,
agent
fullington,
agent
abe
there
was
testifying
as
to
how
he
bought,
how
they
bought
the
marijuana
from
chauvenet.
mr.
gill
objected
your
honor.
this
act
is
inadmissible.
it
took
place
out
of
the
presence
of
my
client.
well,
certainly
this
is
a
good
argument
if
there's
just
one
defendant
being
tried
because
as
your
honors
know,
he
can
only
introduced
against
an
accused
statements
all
acts
that
were
done
in
his
presence.
but
the
exception
to
this
rule,
the
recognized
exception
in
all
jurisdictions
is
that
if
a
conspiracy
is
involved
in
the
case,
you
can
introduce
acts
of
any
of
the
conspirators
and
if
that
the
jury
finds
that
a
conspiracy
existed,
it's
imputable
to
everybody.
in
other
words,
three
people
could
decide
to
murder
or
rob
and
one
person
to
stay
home
the
whole
time
and
the
other
one
go
out
and
do
it,
if
you
could
prove
that
they
conspire
to
do
this,
the
person
who
stayed
home
would
be
just
as
guilty
as
the
murder
or
so
forth
as
the
person
who
went
to
do
the
murder.
so
in
the
instant
case,
the
trial
judge
allowed
in
this
evidence
of
acts
which
took
place
out
of
skinner
and
gueldner's
presence,
allowed
it
in
because
the
state,
the
judge's
rule
had
made
a
prima
facie
showing
of
conspiracy.
that
a
conspiracy
existed
between
these
three
accused.
now,
when
the
trial
judge
came
to
charge
the
jury,
he
told
them
very
--
ms.
louise
korns
yes,
that
he
told
the
jury
--
he
told
them
about
the
law
of
conspiracy
and
then
he
said,
set
out
on
page
28
of
louisiana's
brief,
“unless
you're
satisfied
that
a
conspiracy
has
been
established,
i
charge
you
that
the
acts
and
declarations
of
one
other
parties
to
the
alleged
conspiracy
do
not
bind
the
others.”
therefore,
the
state
feels
that
he
was
protecting,
in
fact
the
state
knows
that
he
was
protecting
the
rights
of
skinner
and
gueldner
when
he
told
them
this.
because
if
he
hadn't
told
the
jury
this
it
would
have
been
the
trial
judge
you
would
have
decided
that
a
conspiracy
existed.
the
trial
judge
would
have
been
allowed
evidence
of
the
acts
of
chauvenet
out
of
the
presence
of
skinner
and
gueldner
and
it
would
have
had
--
it
would
not
have
left
it
up
to
the
jury
whether
to
impute
these
acts
of
skinner
and
gueldner
or
not.
ms.
louise
korns
no
sir
but
it's
well-settled
in
louisiana
and
in
other
jurisdictions
that
the
--
that
when
you
indict
two
or
more
persons,
a
conspiracy
is
involved
in
--
ms.
louise
korns
it
really
is
to
govern
the
laws
of
evidence
your
honor.
it's
because
for
this
very
reason
that
i've
said
so
that
you
can
--
because
otherwise,
you
couldn't
--
because
if
three
people
commit
a
crime
altogether
at
all
times,
you
don't
have
this
problem.
but
if
more
than
two
people
--
if
two
or
more
people
commit
a
crime,
generally,
they
are
not
together
all
the
time.
and
unless
you
have
this
law
governing
the
introduction
of
evidence
which
permits,
which
says
that
the
acts
in
declarations
of
a
conspirator
are
deemed
to
be
consented
to
by
his
co-conspirators
whether
he
was
present
or
not.
ms.
louise
korns
had
judge
becker?
ms.
louise
korns
yes,
judge
becker
was
elected
i
think
about
three
years
ago.
ms.
louise
korns
he's
--
i
think
he
would
say
in
his
60's
judge
black.
i
would
say
in
his
early
60's.
he
was
a
criminal
lawyer
before
that
for
a
long
time.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
he's
argued
cases
before
this
court
and
he
was
elected
well,
let's
say
three
--
two
to
four
years
ago.
ms.
louise
korns
yes.
ms.
louise
korns
the
judge
does
unless
it
say
guilty
as
charged.
we
have
in
capital
cases
than
the
jury
can
bring
in
two
verdicts,
guilty
as
charged
or
guilty
without
capital
punishment.
both
of
those
i
think
are
set
because
guilt
without
capital
punishment
means
life
imprisonment.
under
say
this
particular
case?
ms.
louise
korns
the
judge
has
a
range
of
sentences
set
out
by
the
statute
that
defines
the
crime
of
illegal
possession
of
drugs
says
that
anyone
and
depending
on
the
age
of
the
person
who
sells
and
the
age
person
who
receives
it
whether
it's
selling
or
possessing,
the
sentence
ranges
from
say
i
think
say
the
minimum
for
sale
is
ten
years,
the
minimum
for
possession
is
five
years
and
the
maximum
set
out
also.
ms.
louise
korns
that's
on
the
double,
that's
because
he
was
double
billed
or
even
triple
billed.
ms.
louise
korns
well,
double
billing
again
in
specially
for
selling,
i
think
double
billing,
that
might
have
been
a
minimum
sentence.
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
ms.
louise
korns
well,
this
was
because
he
was
double
billed.
you
see
that
means
--
ms.
louise
korns
double
billed.
this
means,
you
know,
i
think
you
all
call
it
repeat
of
statutes.
ms.
louise
korns
no,
sir.
it
means
that
when
--
ms.
louise
korns
he
had
a
record,
that's
right
within
--
that's
it.
ms.
louise
korns
habitual
offense.
ms.
louise
korns
yes,
within
a
certain
number
of
years
of
that
conviction
and
this
record
here
will
show
that
the
bill
of
information
that
we
call
double
billing
goes
in
and
recites
that
on
such
and
such
a
day,
maybe
it
was
twice.
i
don't
know
whether
this
was
a
third
or
second
time
the
accused
was
found
guilty
and
generally
has
to
be
within
a
time
and
it
has
to
be
a
felony
and
so
forth
that
such
an
offense.
and
then
under
the
statute
setting
out
the
habitual
offender
sentences,
the
sentences
get
pretty
stiff
under
these.
well,
there
are
some
armed
robbery
statutes
that
you
know
go
up
almost
to
life
imprisonment
if
you
keep
on
by
the
third
offender
or
so
forth.
but
this
10
years
you
see
skinner
and
gueldner
for
the
same
offense
got
10
years,
i
think
if
i'm
not
wrong
that
chauvenet
was
a
third
offender.
he
might
just
have
been
the
second
offender
but
it
was
certainly
because
of
that.
ms.
louise
korns
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
if
your
honors
look
at
the
statutes
in
the
record,
i
don't
think
the
--
it
may
be
that
it
was
the
minimum
that
the
judge
could
give
under
the
number
of
previous
offenses
which
had
been
--
which
he
was
guilty.
ms.
louise
korns
thank
you,
your
honors.
