mr.
george
m.
leppert
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors
and
associate
justices.
i
represent
the
three
petitioners
in
this
case,
who
were
convicted
in
a
marijuana
prosecution
at
which
petitioner
skinner
received
10
years,
gueldner
16
years,
and
chauvenet,
the
negro
defendant
received
50
years.
although
we're
relying
upon
strictly
legal
issues
here,
it
is
necessary
to
present
to
you
some
of
the
highlights
in
the
facts.
mr.
skinner
who
received
10
years
was
never
shown
to
have
been
a
user
or
an
addict
or
a
vendor
or
pusher
of
narcotics
in
any
way.
he
engaged
in
a
--
he
was
successfully
engaged
in
two
second-hand
automobile
places
in
new
orleans.
and
it
was
admitted
by
the
narcotics
agents
that
they
undertook
initially
to
make
a
case
against
one
of
his
employees,
they
were
not
after
skinner
at
all,
and
failing
in
that
apparently,
it
made
a
case
against
him
along
with
gueldner,
his
salesman
and
chauvenet
who
was
alleged
to
be
the
pusher.
now,
the
indictment,
the
information
charged
a
single
transaction.
there
were
two
counts.
on
may
21,
1965,
a
sale
of
about
$10.00
with
marijuana
cigarettes
in
possession
of
the
same
cigarettes.
the
manner
in
which
skinner
became
involved
in
this
is
set
forth
clearly
in
the
preliminary
hearing
and
in
the
trial
on
the
merits,
all
of
which
is
referred
to
in
our
brief.
it
amounted
to
a
plea
of
entrapment
but
we're
not
urging
that
because
that's
factual
issue
but
it
is
necessary
to
understand
what
happened.
the
undercover
agent
fullington
had
gotten
as
a
cover
job,
a
position
of
a
financing
manager
of
a
company
which
had
the
yes
or
no
on
loans
used
by
mr.
skinner
in
his
business.
he
ingratiates
himself
with
mr.
skinner.
he
went
out
to
the
race
track
with
him.
he
let
him
put
up
money
for
the
bets.
he
let
him
make
dates
with
him
with
women
and
then
finally
when
he
gotten
that
far
into
his
confidence,
he
informed
him
that
he
wanted
to
get
some
marijuana
for
a
friend
of
his.
and
it
was
set
up
according
to
the
state's
testimony
for
it
to
be
delivered
on
the
night
of
may
the
21st
at
which
time
the
allegedly
took
place
on
the
lot
on
skinner's
lot.
then
under
louisiana
system
evidence
which
is
very
broad,
the
state
was
allowed
to
bring
in
quite
another
transaction
on
may
28
involving
another
portion
$13.00
worth
of
marijuana
which
allegedly
took
place
on
the
same
lot
through
a
meeting
with
chauvenet
set
up
in
the
same
way.
mr.
george
m.
leppert
yes
sir.
now,
under
the
louisiana
system
of
evidence
which
i
say
is
the
broadest
in
the
country,
they
were
also
permitted
to
bring
in
another
transaction
which
neither
skinner
nor
gueldner
had
in
connection
with
and
which
the
agent
said
that
after
he
got
the
second
marijuana,
he
told
chauvenet
he
wanted
to
get
some
heroin
and
he
says
that
chauvenet
on
that
same
day
went
somewhere
else
in
other
part
of
the
city
and
got
some
heroin.
so
there
was
--
on
that
original
deal
that
was
engrafted,
these
other
two
transaction.
one
of
which
two
defendants
the
same,
were
the
same
and
one
of
which
that
had
no
connection
well
except
the
fact
that
it
started
on
the
automobile
lot.
now,
we
won
this
case
originally
by
vote
of
five
to
two
in
the
state
supreme
court
on
the
theory
that
the
court
had
erroneously
given
a
full
blown
conspiracy
charge
whereas
none
was
involved.
there
was
a
separate
conspiracy
case
turning
and
we
contended
that
the
lower
court,
the
trial
court
had
become
confused
and
went
further
than
saying
that
admission
of
evidence
of
one
conspirator
statements
could
be
used
against
the
other.
but
he
gave
a
full
blown
partnership
theory
of
conspiracy.
we
won
it
five
to
two
and
on
a
rehearing,
they
reversed
themselves
and
ruled
six
to
one
against
us
and
then
denied
all
the
other
bills.
i'm
not
pressing
that
point
now
because
i
believe
that
that
procedure
was
wrong.
i
have
not
abandoned
it
in
any
way.
i
believe
that
the
two
errors
are
more
of
greater
national
interest.
and
we
come
therefore
to
the
main
point,
two
points
which
we
urge
here.
the
defendant
chauvenet,
this
indigent
negro,
33
years
old
was
arrested
and
he
had
a
series
of
court-appointed
counsel.
he
had
three
counsels
appointed
before
my
associate,
mr.
link
finally
got
into
the
case.
he
stayed
in
jail
a
nearly
a
year.
he
had
a
bail
bond
of
$50,000.00
and
nobody
did
anything
for
him.
now,
it
is
misleading
to
state
as
the
state
does
that
none
of
these
three
counsels
did
anything
because
of
illness.
the
only
thing
about
illness
of
previous
counsel
is
that
passing
reference
in
a
motion
which
indicates
that
at
some
time,
one
of
them
was
ill
but
there's
no
evidence
about
any
continued
illness.
there's
certainly
no
suggestion
that
all
three
of
them
were
ill
for
a
year.
nobody
did
anything
for
him.
finally,
after
the
case,
after
the
--
while
he
was
still
in
jail,
and
while
he
had
no
notice
of
anything
that
was
going
on,
as
far
as
there
were,
not
even
notice
of
any
hearing,
there
were
extensive
hearings
filed
on
behalf
of
our
clients,
that
is
mr.
gill,
for
whom
i
have
loss
because
he
tried
the
case
for
chauvenet
and
gueldner.
and
mr.
link
finally
tried
it
for
chauvenet.
i
mean,
we
represent
skinner
and
gueldner
and
he
represent
chauvenet.
excuse
me.
there
was
a
motion
for
preliminary
examination,
a
motion
to
quash,
a
motion
to
suppress
and
motion
on
bill
of
particulars.
as
we
note
in
our
brief,
there
was
some
40
odd
pages
of
testimony
taken
on
which
went
right
to
the
vitals
of
the
case.
now,
under
the
louisiana
system,
as
to
these
preliminary
hearings,
the
preliminary
hearing
says,
the
premise
of
preserving
evidence
and
under
article
265,
this
evidence
could
have
been
used
later.
the
fact
that
it
was
--
was
not
as
of
the
moment.
it
was
a
part
of
the
case.
and
moreover,
as
the
court
noted,
these
preliminary
hearings
were
taken
in
connection
with
the
pending
motion
for
bill
of
particulars,
so
it
was
exploratory
in
nature.
but
chauvenet
had
nobody
there.
he
languished
in
jail
while
all
this
went
on,
and
then
finally,
when
mr.
link
got
into
the
case,
got
his
bond
reduced
to
$5,000.00
and
got
him
out
jail
shortly
before
trial.
he
was
faced
with
this
situation.
he
got
a
copy
of
the
transcript
of
all
his
other
motions
and
he
knew
what
it
happened.
and
in
that
motion,
there
was
a
part
that
the
state
had
a
made
an
error
as
to
the
vendee
on
one
of
these
transactions.
they
were
later
to
amend
it
virtually
on
the
eve
of
the
trial.
they
said
it
was
sold
to
a
different
agent,
fullington
instead
of
abe.
but
he
actually
didn't
want
to
disturb
that
and
he
could
not
have
gotten
a
preliminary
hearing
as
a
matter
of
right
because
under
our
louisiana
system,
under
article
295
--
292,
the
court
of
criminal
procedure,
the
right
to
a
preliminary
hearing
is
granted
right
only
before
the
information
or
the
indictment
and
he
could
--
and
it
will
be
highly
status
urged
that
he
waived
the
right.
it's
obvious
that
after
having
heard
all
of
that
testimony
and
after
the
trial
court
said
that
he
had
no
interest
in
those
motions
anyway
because
he
didn't
file
them,
the
chances
of
either
one
out
of
a
thousand,
they
would
have
granted
him.
so
mr.
link
did
not
file
the
motion
and
he
relied
on
the
error
which
was
in
there,
which
was
cured
by
an
amendment.
now,
the
state
urges
that
even
if
we
were
--
even
if
there
were
errors
to
as
to
chauvenet
that
we
have
no
standing
that
challenged
it
that
skinner
and
gueldner
were
not
prejudiced.
it
is
our
position
because
those
motions
would
have
been
a
real
hearing
if
this
man
had
been
there.
the
record
shows
that
the
state
officers
were
interviewing
this
man
in
jail,
trying
to
get
a
statement
out
of
him,
obviously
trying
to
get
him
into
state's
evidence.
we
were
not
representing
him.
we
couldn't
talk
to
him.
for
all
we
knew,
he
might
be
state's
evidence.
and
the
most
significant
thing
is
that
when
they
came
to
the
trial,
this
is
where
they're
prejudiced
hits
us
right
between
the
eyes.
for
the
first
time,
they
come
in
with
this
completely
unrelated
heroin
transaction
in
which
chauvenet
alone
was
involved
with
the
agent
fullington.
so
we
contend
that
that
alone
was
clearly
prejudicial
and
moreover,
if
this
was
a
part
of
the
trial,
if
this
preliminary
hearing
which
preserves
evidence
for
the
trial,
which
affects
three
co-defendants
was
a
part
of
the
trial.
we
were
entitled
to
have
him
there.
we
might
have
found
out
something
about
it
because
the
court
said
that
he
was
going
to
consider
all
that
evidence
in
connection
with
the
bill
of
particulars
so
it
was
exploratory.
so
i
now
pass
to
the
next
point.
i
would
like
to
save
myself
10
minutes
for
rebuttal
if
i
may.
the
problem
of
the
all
night
session
and
the
sleeping
jurors.
this
case
started
at
10:30
in
the
morning.
my
associate
mr.
gill
is
a
man
68
years
old,
suffering
from
diabetes
and
other
complications
which
were
testified
too
by
his
doctors
and
he's
able
as
the
record
show
to
try
a
normal
day
but
at
11:40,
he
begged
the
court
to
recess,
11:40
that
night.
he
had
been
going
all
day,
hammer
and
tongs.
he
asked
him,
he
said,
“i'm
sick,
you
know
i'm
sick.”
and
i'm
quoting
it
all
in
the
brief.
“please
give
us
a
recess.”
they
gave
him
a
three-minute
recess
which
he
extended,
generously
extended
for
35
minutes
and
then
made
them
go
nearly
three
o'clock
in
the
morning.
three
o'clock,
they
recessed,
came
back
at
9:30
and
argued
the
case.
mr.
george
m.
leppert
yes
sir.
they
had
a
--
i
think
he
was
technically
arrested
the
night
but
there
was
no
more
testimony
that
night.
yes.
the
only
thing
that
went
far
the
next
morning
was
the
argument
in
drugs.
mr.
george
m.
leppert
that's
my
interpretation.
yes
sir.
then
it
was
brought
out
to
the
jurors
who
were
sleeping.
there
was
considerable
testimony,
pro
and
con
on
that
accorded
the
principal
sources
of
it
that
covers
many
pages.
the
most
significant
thing
is
though
that
there
were
two
very
strong
witnesses.
the
court's
own
trial
of
mr.
marchi's
in
the
face
of
the
court's
aggressive
attitude
of
hostility
toward
decided
that
anybody
was
sleeping
in
his
courtroom.
he
took
the
stand
and
he
said,
he
sure
look
like
he
was
sleeping.
and
then
there
was
the
one
little
sentence
i'd
like
to
read
it
from
one
of
the
witnesses,
one
of
the
other
witnesses
who
was
respondent
of
the
district
attorney's
very
aggressive
cross-examination.
he
was
trying
to
get
him
to
say,
you
got
to
say
whether
he
was
sleeping
or
not
and
the
answer
was
this,
answer:
“when
somebody's
eyes
are
closed
and
his
head
is
hanging
down
and
he
has
to
be
woke
up,
i
will
draw
the
conclusion
he's
sleeping.
if
somebody
had
to
wake
me
up,
i'd
be
sleeping.”
to
which
the
prosecutor
counted.
that
is
subjective,
that's
you.
there's
no
opinion
there.
answer:
“if
he
wasn't
sleeping,
why
would
he
have
to
be
woke
up.”
and
i
submit
him
out
of
subject
to
rebuttal
with
him.
mr.
george
m.
leppert
sir,
the
finding
of
fact
by
the
supreme
court.
well,
first
of
all,
the
district
court
finds
that
nobody
was
asleep.
the
supreme
court
--
mr.
george
m.
leppert
there
was
nobody
definitely
asleep.
of
course,
we
contend,
you
don't
have
to
find
that
they're
asleep
if
the
--
you
require
something
more
than
12
warm
bodies
and
we
certainly
didn't
have
that
now.
oh!
one
other
thing
before
i
close,
they
want
to
apply
it
to
prejudicial
effect.
mr.
george
m.
leppert
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
m.
leppert
yes
sir.
mr.
george
m.
leppert
yes
sir.
i
mean
--
well,
i'm
glad
you
brought
that
up
your
honor,
i
want
to
bring
in
additional
point
of
the
prejudice
if
i
may.
mr.
gill
after
the
trial
put
on
his
arguments
to
the
extensive
medical
problem
and
how
he
had
to
be
put
in
a
hospital
later
and
thought
this
was
a
result
to
this.
and
the
question
arose
is
to
how
we
were
prejudiced
and
the
supreme
court,
the
state
supreme
court
took
the
position
that
he
could
have
been
prejudiced
very
much
because
mr.
gill
kept
on
talking,
kept
on
making
objections
and
apparently
on
the
face
of
the
record
he
was
--
he
might
have
been
tired
but
there
was
no
prejudice.
but
there
is
strong
in
title
evidence
in
the
record
that
there
was
gross
prejudice
for
two
reasons.
number
one,
as
noted
in
the
motion
for
rehearing
the
state
supreme
court,
he
forgot
in
his
exhaustion,
in
his
diabetic
condition,
he
forgot
to
put
on
a
principal
witness
to
prove
that
the
automobile
where
the
marijuana
is
supposed
to
have
been
stashed
didn't
belong
to
the
defendant
skinner.
he
forgot
it.
mr.
george
m.
leppert
sir?
mr.
george
m.
leppert
it
could
have
because
it
was
a
divided
jury,
11
to
1
jury.
mr.
george
m.
leppert
it
could
have
a
lot.
mr.
george
m.
leppert
because
it
would
remind
them
of
the
question
of
whether
he
got
anything
to
do
with
it.
he
never
took
the
stand.
mr.
george
m.
leppert
i
think
it
does
but
i
submit
to
my
argument
because
it
was
circumstantial
evidence
to
compile
it
and
there
was
a
short
conflict
in
another
bill
as
to
whether
the
thing
happened
at
all
on
the
day.
there
was
a
factual
issue.
mr.
george
m.
leppert
yes
sir
and
i
say
--
mr.
george
m.
leppert
yes
sir
and
i
want
to
add
this
one
point
mr.
justice.
mr.
george
m.
leppert
well,
that's
the
day
he
forgot
to
do
it.
he
closed
without
doing
anything.
the
next
morning,
i
think
they
had
a
right
to
do
it
and
he
didn't
put
him
on.
now,
there's
other
evidence
in
that
and
he
is
a
veteran
lawyer,
40
years
political
experience,
strictly
criminal
law.
who
gets
up
and
this
is
in
the
record.
in
his
argument,
he
starts
talking
about
another
type
of
drug
which
was
involved
in
another
case
an
anti-amphetamine,
one
of
these
many
drug
things
and
he
said,
“well,
that's
the
same
thing
my
doctor
gives
me,
i
took
one
of
them
this
morning.”
he
was
wondering
and
the
state
objected.
i
think
its
clear
cut
evidence
that
the
man
was
not
up
the
par.
and
it's
exactly
what
his
doctor
said
that
after
going
12
hours,
a
man
at
that
age
in
that
condition
had
inefficiency,
he
was
practically
new.
i
submit
now.
mr.
george
m.
leppert
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors
and
in
reply
to
the
question
as
to
what
the
state
supreme
court
disposition
was
of
the
lack
of
representation
why
--
of
chauvenet,
i
might
say
that
it's
covered
most
succinctly
in
about
20
lines,
the
factual
background
is
starting
at
391
and
the
rationale
is
in
about
10
lines
on
the
top
of
page
392
of
column
1
of
204
southern
second.
and
i'll
use
half
of
my
five
minutes
just
to
read
that
if
i
may.
here's
the
whole
disposition
of
that
major
argument.
the
court
said,
“it
is
true
that
the
minutes
of
court
must
show
that
the
accused
was
present
at
every
important
stage
of
a
trial
for
a
felony
when
the
moment
of
his
arraignment
to
his
sentence
stating
a
number
of
state,
deciding
a
number
of
state
cases.
but
at
stated
supra,
defendant
chauvenet
pleaded
not
guilty
and
was
thereafter
represented
by
counsel.
well,
he
was
represented
only
in
the
sense
that
he
had
one
on
paper
who
never
showed
up
for
a
period
of
---
she
is
correct,
it
wasn't
a
whole
year,
it
was
about
seven
months.
but
for
seven
months
he
was
represented
on
paper
only.
they
continue
into
this.
his
counsel
did
not
file
a
motion
to
suppress
under
such
circumstances,
we
conclude
that
it
was
imperative
that
he
be
present
at
the
trial
of
the
motion
to
suppress
and
dismiss,
filed
by
defendants
skinner
and
gueldner.
chauvenet
suffered
neither
prejudice
nor
violation
of
his
constitutional
right.
they
don't
go
into
the
question
of
whether
this
was
part
of
his
trial.
it
just
that
--
mr.
george
m.
leppert
they
--
it
was
extensive
evidence
mr.
justice
black
in
connection
with
the
motion
for
a
preliminary
examination
which
under
our
law
could
have
been
used
at
the
trial.
mr.
george
m.
leppert
no
the
search
that
was
withdrawn
but
there
was
40
--
between
45
and
50
pages
of
testimony
on
the
motion
for
preliminary
hearing
and
motion
to
--
motion
for
preliminary
examination
and
bill
of
particulars,
there
was
extensive
evidence
on
that.
now,
i
say
--
mr.
george
m.
leppert
no
the
evidence
was
offered
but
i'm
saying
the
motion
to
suppress
--
mr.
george
m.
leppert
except
in
so
far
it
was
repeated.
no,
it
was
not
offered
as
such,
no
sir.
now,
in
conclusion,
i
want
to
give
you
the
climate
of
this
business,
of
why
they
have
they
had
to
work
that
late
at
night.
mr.
gill
in
his
motion
for
a
new
trial
wanted
all
the
medical
testimony
and
he
pointed
out,
the
record
in
331,
volume
2
that
he
was
able
to
work
normal
hours
if
he
just
finish
the
case
and
he
went
four
hours
before
the
judge
cox,
the
one
who
succeeded
the
present
judge
and
the
trial
judge
says,
“you're
trying
it
with
an
old
man,
he
doesn't
have
energy.”
and
a
moment
later
he
declared
that
record
331,
“i
succeeded
the
man
you
tried
the
case
with
and
his
docket
was
in
terrible
shape.
i
cleared
it
up,
the
backlog
he
left.
the
only
way
i
do
it
is
because
i
force
lawyers
to
try
cases,
defense
and
state,
that's
the
only
way
the
judge
is
going
to
stay
up
on
his
docket.”
mr.
george
m.
leppert
yes.
mr.
george
m.
leppert
yes
sir
but
we
reply
to
that
that
there
are
limits
to
it
and
we
stated
on
page
67
of
our
brief
to
the
state
supreme
court,
a
judicial
docket
which
moves
along
as
blindly
and
inexorably
as
an
assembly
line
may
drop
off
the
volume
of
oddly
shape
judicial
products
and
that's
what
we
claim
up
here.
mr.
george
m.
leppert
sir?
mr.
george
m.
leppert
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
george
m.
leppert
yes
but
there
was
no
--
the
record
doesn't
show
any
reason
move
and
as
far
as
his
previous
continuances,
the
record
has
bear
of
any
time
with
his
previous
medical
condition.
it's
merely
a
supposition
that
mr.
gill
had
gotten
previous
contingencies.
there
were
several
reasons
he
might
have
gotten.
and
one
of
them
was
the
states
would
have
to
amend
the
bill.
i
submit.
mr.
george
m.
leppert
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors
and
associate
justices.
i
represent
the
three
petitioners
in
this
case,
who
were
convicted
in
a
marijuana
prosecution
at
which
petitioner
skinner
received
10
years,
gueldner
16
years,
and
chauvenet,
the
negro
defendant
received
50
years.
although
we're
relying
upon
strictly
legal
issues
here,
it
is
necessary
to
present
to
you
some
of
the
highlights
in
the
facts.
mr.
skinner
who
received
10
years
was
never
shown
to
have
been
a
user
or
an
addict
or
a
vendor
or
pusher
of
narcotics
in
any
way.
he
engaged
in
a
--
he
was
successfully
engaged
in
two
second-hand
automobile
places
in
new
orleans.
and
it
was
admitted
by
the
narcotics
agents
that
they
undertook
initially
to
make
a
case
against
one
of
his
employees,
they
were
not
after
skinner
at
all,
and
failing
in
that
apparently,
it
made
a
case
against
him
along
with
gueldner,
his
salesman
and
chauvenet
who
was
alleged
to
be
the
pusher.
now,
the
indictment,
the
information
charged
a
single
transaction.
there
were
two
counts.
on
may
21,
1965,
a
sale
of
about
$10.00
with
marijuana
cigarettes
in
possession
of
the
same
cigarettes.
the
manner
in
which
skinner
became
involved
in
this
is
set
forth
clearly
in
the
preliminary
hearing
and
in
the
trial
on
the
merits,
all
of
which
is
referred
to
in
our
brief.
it
amounted
to
a
plea
of
entrapment
but
we're
not
urging
that
because
that's
factual
issue
but
it
is
necessary
to
understand
what
happened.
the
undercover
agent
fullington
had
gotten
as
a
cover
job,
a
position
of
a
financing
manager
of
a
company
which
had
the
yes
or
no
on
loans
used
by
mr.
skinner
in
his
business.
he
ingratiates
himself
with
mr.
skinner.
he
went
out
to
the
race
track
with
him.
he
let
him
put
up
money
for
the
bets.
he
let
him
make
dates
with
him
with
women
and
then
finally
when
he
gotten
that
far
into
his
confidence,
he
informed
him
that
he
wanted
to
get
some
marijuana
for
a
friend
of
his.
and
it
was
set
up
according
to
the
state's
testimony
for
it
to
be
delivered
on
the
night
of
may
the
21st
at
which
time
the
allegedly
took
place
on
the
lot
on
skinner's
lot.
then
under
louisiana
system
evidence
which
is
very
broad,
the
state
was
allowed
to
bring
in
quite
another
transaction
on
may
28
involving
another
portion
$13.00
worth
of
marijuana
which
allegedly
took
place
on
the
same
lot
through
a
meeting
with
chauvenet
set
up
in
the
same
way.
mr.
george
m.
leppert
yes
sir.
now,
under
the
louisiana
system
of
evidence
which
i
say
is
the
broadest
in
the
country,
they
were
also
permitted
to
bring
in
another
transaction
which
neither
skinner
nor
gueldner
had
in
connection
with
and
which
the
agent
said
that
after
he
got
the
second
marijuana,
he
told
chauvenet
he
wanted
to
get
some
heroin
and
he
says
that
chauvenet
on
that
same
day
went
somewhere
else
in
other
part
of
the
city
and
got
some
heroin.
so
there
was
--
on
that
original
deal
that
was
engrafted,
these
other
two
transaction.
one
of
which
two
defendants
the
same,
were
the
same
and
one
of
which
that
had
no
connection
well
except
the
fact
that
it
started
on
the
automobile
lot.
now,
we
won
this
case
originally
by
vote
of
five
to
two
in
the
state
supreme
court
on
the
theory
that
the
court
had
erroneously
given
a
full
blown
conspiracy
charge
whereas
none
was
involved.
there
was
a
separate
conspiracy
case
turning
and
we
contended
that
the
lower
court,
the
trial
court
had
become
confused
and
went
further
than
saying
that
admission
of
evidence
of
one
conspirator
statements
could
be
used
against
the
other.
but
he
gave
a
full
blown
partnership
theory
of
conspiracy.
we
won
it
five
to
two
and
on
a
rehearing,
they
reversed
themselves
and
ruled
six
to
one
against
us
and
then
denied
all
the
other
bills.
i'm
not
pressing
that
point
now
because
i
believe
that
that
procedure
was
wrong.
i
have
not
abandoned
it
in
any
way.
i
believe
that
the
two
errors
are
more
of
greater
national
interest.
and
we
come
therefore
to
the
main
point,
two
points
which
we
urge
here.
the
defendant
chauvenet,
this
indigent
negro,
33
years
old
was
arrested
and
he
had
a
series
of
court-appointed
counsel.
he
had
three
counsels
appointed
before
my
associate,
mr.
link
finally
got
into
the
case.
he
stayed
in
jail
a
nearly
a
year.
he
had
a
bail
bond
of
$50,000.00
and
nobody
did
anything
for
him.
now,
it
is
misleading
to
state
as
the
state
does
that
none
of
these
three
counsels
did
anything
because
of
illness.
the
only
thing
about
illness
of
previous
counsel
is
that
passing
reference
in
a
motion
which
indicates
that
at
some
time,
one
of
them
was
ill
but
there's
no
evidence
about
any
continued
illness.
there's
certainly
no
suggestion
that
all
three
of
them
were
ill
for
a
year.
nobody
did
anything
for
him.
finally,
after
the
case,
after
the
--
while
he
was
still
in
jail,
and
while
he
had
no
notice
of
anything
that
was
going
on,
as
far
as
there
were,
not
even
notice
of
any
hearing,
there
were
extensive
hearings
filed
on
behalf
of
our
clients,
that
is
mr.
gill,
for
whom
i
have
loss
because
he
tried
the
case
for
chauvenet
and
gueldner.
and
mr.
link
finally
tried
it
for
chauvenet.
i
mean,
we
represent
skinner
and
gueldner
and
he
represent
chauvenet.
excuse
me.
there
was
a
motion
for
preliminary
examination,
a
motion
to
quash,
a
motion
to
suppress
and
motion
on
bill
of
particulars.
as
we
note
in
our
brief,
there
was
some
40
odd
pages
of
testimony
taken
on
which
went
right
to
the
vitals
of
the
case.
now,
under
the
louisiana
system,
as
to
these
preliminary
hearings,
the
preliminary
hearing
says,
the
premise
of
preserving
evidence
and
under
article
265,
this
evidence
could
have
been
used
later.
the
fact
that
it
was
--
was
not
as
of
the
moment.
it
was
a
part
of
the
case.
and
moreover,
as
the
court
noted,
these
preliminary
hearings
were
taken
in
connection
with
the
pending
motion
for
bill
of
particulars,
so
it
was
exploratory
in
nature.
but
chauvenet
had
nobody
there.
he
languished
in
jail
while
all
this
went
on,
and
then
finally,
when
mr.
link
got
into
the
case,
got
his
bond
reduced
to
$5,000.00
and
got
him
out
jail
shortly
before
trial.
he
was
faced
with
this
situation.
he
got
a
copy
of
the
transcript
of
all
his
other
motions
and
he
knew
what
it
happened.
and
in
that
motion,
there
was
a
part
that
the
state
had
a
made
an
error
as
to
the
vendee
on
one
of
these
transactions.
they
were
later
to
amend
it
virtually
on
the
eve
of
the
trial.
they
said
it
was
sold
to
a
different
agent,
fullington
instead
of
abe.
but
he
actually
didn't
want
to
disturb
that
and
he
could
not
have
gotten
a
preliminary
hearing
as
a
matter
of
right
because
under
our
louisiana
system,
under
article
295
--
292,
the
court
of
criminal
procedure,
the
right
to
a
preliminary
hearing
is
granted
right
only
before
the
information
or
the
indictment
and
he
could
--
and
it
will
be
highly
status
urged
that
he
waived
the
right.
it's
obvious
that
after
having
heard
all
of
that
testimony
and
after
the
trial
court
said
that
he
had
no
interest
in
those
motions
anyway
because
he
didn't
file
them,
the
chances
of
either
one
out
of
a
thousand,
they
would
have
granted
him.
so
mr.
link
did
not
file
the
motion
and
he
relied
on
the
error
which
was
in
there,
which
was
cured
by
an
amendment.
now,
the
state
urges
that
even
if
we
were
--
even
if
there
were
errors
to
as
to
chauvenet
that
we
have
no
standing
that
challenged
it
that
skinner
and
gueldner
were
not
prejudiced.
it
is
our
position
because
those
motions
would
have
been
a
real
hearing
if
this
man
had
been
there.
the
record
shows
that
the
state
officers
were
interviewing
this
man
in
jail,
trying
to
get
a
statement
out
of
him,
obviously
trying
to
get
him
into
state's
evidence.
we
were
not
representing
him.
we
couldn't
talk
to
him.
for
all
we
knew,
he
might
be
state's
evidence.
and
the
most
significant
thing
is
that
when
they
came
to
the
trial,
this
is
where
they're
prejudiced
hits
us
right
between
the
eyes.
for
the
first
time,
they
come
in
with
this
completely
unrelated
heroin
transaction
in
which
chauvenet
alone
was
involved
with
the
agent
fullington.
so
we
contend
that
that
alone
was
clearly
prejudicial
and
moreover,
if
this
was
a
part
of
the
trial,
if
this
preliminary
hearing
which
preserves
evidence
for
the
trial,
which
affects
three
co-defendants
was
a
part
of
the
trial.
we
were
entitled
to
have
him
there.
we
might
have
found
out
something
about
it
because
the
court
said
that
he
was
going
to
consider
all
that
evidence
in
connection
with
the
bill
of
particulars
so
it
was
exploratory.
so
i
now
pass
to
the
next
point.
i
would
like
to
save
myself
10
minutes
for
rebuttal
if
i
may.
the
problem
of
the
all
night
session
and
the
sleeping
jurors.
this
case
started
at
10:30
in
the
morning.
my
associate
mr.
gill
is
a
man
68
years
old,
suffering
from
diabetes
and
other
complications
which
were
testified
too
by
his
doctors
and
he's
able
as
the
record
show
to
try
a
normal
day
but
at
11:40,
he
begged
the
court
to
recess,
11:40
that
night.
he
had
been
going
all
day,
hammer
and
tongs.
he
asked
him,
he
said,
“i'm
sick,
you
know
i'm
sick.”
and
i'm
quoting
it
all
in
the
brief.
“please
give
us
a
recess.”
they
gave
him
a
three-minute
recess
which
he
extended,
generously
extended
for
35
minutes
and
then
made
them
go
nearly
three
o'clock
in
the
morning.
three
o'clock,
they
recessed,
came
back
at
9:30
and
argued
the
case.
mr.
george
m.
leppert
yes
sir.
they
had
a
--
i
think
he
was
technically
arrested
the
night
but
there
was
no
more
testimony
that
night.
yes.
the
only
thing
that
went
far
the
next
morning
was
the
argument
in
drugs.
mr.
george
m.
leppert
that's
my
interpretation.
yes
sir.
then
it
was
brought
out
to
the
jurors
who
were
sleeping.
there
was
considerable
testimony,
pro
and
con
on
that
accorded
the
principal
sources
of
it
that
covers
many
pages.
the
most
significant
thing
is
though
that
there
were
two
very
strong
witnesses.
the
court's
own
trial
of
mr.
marchi's
in
the
face
of
the
court's
aggressive
attitude
of
hostility
toward
decided
that
anybody
was
sleeping
in
his
courtroom.
he
took
the
stand
and
he
said,
he
sure
look
like
he
was
sleeping.
and
then
there
was
the
one
little
sentence
i'd
like
to
read
it
from
one
of
the
witnesses,
one
of
the
other
witnesses
who
was
respondent
of
the
district
attorney's
very
aggressive
cross-examination.
he
was
trying
to
get
him
to
say,
you
got
to
say
whether
he
was
sleeping
or
not
and
the
answer
was
this,
answer:
“when
somebody's
eyes
are
closed
and
his
head
is
hanging
down
and
he
has
to
be
woke
up,
i
will
draw
the
conclusion
he's
sleeping.
if
somebody
had
to
wake
me
up,
i'd
be
sleeping.”
to
which
the
prosecutor
counted.
that
is
subjective,
that's
you.
there's
no
opinion
there.
answer:
“if
he
wasn't
sleeping,
why
would
he
have
to
be
woke
up.”
and
i
submit
him
out
of
subject
to
rebuttal
with
him.
mr.
george
m.
leppert
sir,
the
finding
of
fact
by
the
supreme
court.
well,
first
of
all,
the
district
court
finds
that
nobody
was
asleep.
the
supreme
court
--
mr.
george
m.
leppert
there
was
nobody
definitely
asleep.
of
course,
we
contend,
you
don't
have
to
find
that
they're
asleep
if
the
--
you
require
something
more
than
12
warm
bodies
and
we
certainly
didn't
have
that
now.
oh!
one
other
thing
before
i
close,
they
want
to
apply
it
to
prejudicial
effect.
mr.
george
m.
leppert
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
m.
leppert
yes
sir.
mr.
george
m.
leppert
yes
sir.
i
mean
--
well,
i'm
glad
you
brought
that
up
your
honor,
i
want
to
bring
in
additional
point
of
the
prejudice
if
i
may.
mr.
gill
after
the
trial
put
on
his
arguments
to
the
extensive
medical
problem
and
how
he
had
to
be
put
in
a
hospital
later
and
thought
this
was
a
result
to
this.
and
the
question
arose
is
to
how
we
were
prejudiced
and
the
supreme
court,
the
state
supreme
court
took
the
position
that
he
could
have
been
prejudiced
very
much
because
mr.
gill
kept
on
talking,
kept
on
making
objections
and
apparently
on
the
face
of
the
record
he
was
--
he
might
have
been
tired
but
there
was
no
prejudice.
but
there
is
strong
in
title
evidence
in
the
record
that
there
was
gross
prejudice
for
two
reasons.
number
one,
as
noted
in
the
motion
for
rehearing
the
state
supreme
court,
he
forgot
in
his
exhaustion,
in
his
diabetic
condition,
he
forgot
to
put
on
a
principal
witness
to
prove
that
the
automobile
where
the
marijuana
is
supposed
to
have
been
stashed
didn't
belong
to
the
defendant
skinner.
he
forgot
it.
mr.
george
m.
leppert
sir?
mr.
george
m.
leppert
it
could
have
because
it
was
a
divided
jury,
11
to
1
jury.
mr.
george
m.
leppert
it
could
have
a
lot.
mr.
george
m.
leppert
because
it
would
remind
them
of
the
question
of
whether
he
got
anything
to
do
with
it.
he
never
took
the
stand.
mr.
george
m.
leppert
i
think
it
does
but
i
submit
to
my
argument
because
it
was
circumstantial
evidence
to
compile
it
and
there
was
a
short
conflict
in
another
bill
as
to
whether
the
thing
happened
at
all
on
the
day.
there
was
a
factual
issue.
mr.
george
m.
leppert
yes
sir
and
i
say
--
mr.
george
m.
leppert
yes
sir
and
i
want
to
add
this
one
point
mr.
justice.
mr.
george
m.
leppert
well,
that's
the
day
he
forgot
to
do
it.
he
closed
without
doing
anything.
the
next
morning,
i
think
they
had
a
right
to
do
it
and
he
didn't
put
him
on.
now,
there's
other
evidence
in
that
and
he
is
a
veteran
lawyer,
40
years
political
experience,
strictly
criminal
law.
who
gets
up
and
this
is
in
the
record.
in
his
argument,
he
starts
talking
about
another
type
of
drug
which
was
involved
in
another
case
an
anti-amphetamine,
one
of
these
many
drug
things
and
he
said,
“well,
that's
the
same
thing
my
doctor
gives
me,
i
took
one
of
them
this
morning.”
he
was
wondering
and
the
state
objected.
i
think
its
clear
cut
evidence
that
the
man
was
not
up
the
par.
and
it's
exactly
what
his
doctor
said
that
after
going
12
hours,
a
man
at
that
age
in
that
condition
had
inefficiency,
he
was
practically
new.
i
submit
now.
mr.
george
m.
leppert
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors
and
in
reply
to
the
question
as
to
what
the
state
supreme
court
disposition
was
of
the
lack
of
representation
why
--
of
chauvenet,
i
might
say
that
it's
covered
most
succinctly
in
about
20
lines,
the
factual
background
is
starting
at
391
and
the
rationale
is
in
about
10
lines
on
the
top
of
page
392
of
column
1
of
204
southern
second.
and
i'll
use
half
of
my
five
minutes
just
to
read
that
if
i
may.
here's
the
whole
disposition
of
that
major
argument.
the
court
said,
“it
is
true
that
the
minutes
of
court
must
show
that
the
accused
was
present
at
every
important
stage
of
a
trial
for
a
felony
when
the
moment
of
his
arraignment
to
his
sentence
stating
a
number
of
state,
deciding
a
number
of
state
cases.
but
at
stated
supra,
defendant
chauvenet
pleaded
not
guilty
and
was
thereafter
represented
by
counsel.
well,
he
was
represented
only
in
the
sense
that
he
had
one
on
paper
who
never
showed
up
for
a
period
of
---
she
is
correct,
it
wasn't
a
whole
year,
it
was
about
seven
months.
but
for
seven
months
he
was
represented
on
paper
only.
they
continue
into
this.
his
counsel
did
not
file
a
motion
to
suppress
under
such
circumstances,
we
conclude
that
it
was
imperative
that
he
be
present
at
the
trial
of
the
motion
to
suppress
and
dismiss,
filed
by
defendants
skinner
and
gueldner.
chauvenet
suffered
neither
prejudice
nor
violation
of
his
constitutional
right.
they
don't
go
into
the
question
of
whether
this
was
part
of
his
trial.
it
just
that
--
mr.
george
m.
leppert
they
--
it
was
extensive
evidence
mr.
justice
black
in
connection
with
the
motion
for
a
preliminary
examination
which
under
our
law
could
have
been
used
at
the
trial.
mr.
george
m.
leppert
no
the
search
that
was
withdrawn
but
there
was
40
--
between
45
and
50
pages
of
testimony
on
the
motion
for
preliminary
hearing
and
motion
to
--
motion
for
preliminary
examination
and
bill
of
particulars,
there
was
extensive
evidence
on
that.
now,
i
say
--
mr.
george
m.
leppert
no
the
evidence
was
offered
but
i'm
saying
the
motion
to
suppress
--
mr.
george
m.
leppert
except
in
so
far
it
was
repeated.
no,
it
was
not
offered
as
such,
no
sir.
now,
in
conclusion,
i
want
to
give
you
the
climate
of
this
business,
of
why
they
have
they
had
to
work
that
late
at
night.
mr.
gill
in
his
motion
for
a
new
trial
wanted
all
the
medical
testimony
and
he
pointed
out,
the
record
in
331,
volume
2
that
he
was
able
to
work
normal
hours
if
he
just
finish
the
case
and
he
went
four
hours
before
the
judge
cox,
the
one
who
succeeded
the
present
judge
and
the
trial
judge
says,
“you're
trying
it
with
an
old
man,
he
doesn't
have
energy.”
and
a
moment
later
he
declared
that
record
331,
“i
succeeded
the
man
you
tried
the
case
with
and
his
docket
was
in
terrible
shape.
i
cleared
it
up,
the
backlog
he
left.
the
only
way
i
do
it
is
because
i
force
lawyers
to
try
cases,
defense
and
state,
that's
the
only
way
the
judge
is
going
to
stay
up
on
his
docket.”
mr.
george
m.
leppert
yes.
mr.
george
m.
leppert
yes
sir
but
we
reply
to
that
that
there
are
limits
to
it
and
we
stated
on
page
67
of
our
brief
to
the
state
supreme
court,
a
judicial
docket
which
moves
along
as
blindly
and
inexorably
as
an
assembly
line
may
drop
off
the
volume
of
oddly
shape
judicial
products
and
that's
what
we
claim
up
here.
mr.
george
m.
leppert
sir?
mr.
george
m.
leppert
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
george
m.
leppert
yes
but
there
was
no
--
the
record
doesn't
show
any
reason
move
and
as
far
as
his
previous
continuances,
the
record
has
bear
of
any
time
with
his
previous
medical
condition.
it's
merely
a
supposition
that
mr.
gill
had
gotten
previous
contingencies.
there
were
several
reasons
he
might
have
gotten.
and
one
of
them
was
the
states
would
have
to
amend
the
bill.
i
submit.
