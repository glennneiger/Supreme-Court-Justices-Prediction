justice
byron
r.
white
we
haven't
primarily
(inaudible)
the
settlement
issue.
i
think
that's
otherwise
a
circulation
(inaudible)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
or
that
--
except
for
the
sunday
edition,
why
should
we
think
that
we
can
do
it
both
the
other
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
just
thought
that
that
argument
had
taken
was
another
effect
of
the
editorial
voice,
would
that
suggest
that
it
is
a
first
amendment
consideration?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
you
suggest
that
there's
no
first
amendment
to
--
in
terms
of
first
amendment
so
as
to
present
a
violation?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
what
it
did
in
your
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
really
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
here
to
do
what
the
court
did
that
it
really,
it
really
perhaps,
(inaudible)
carrying
the
importance
of
the
business.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
make
the
same
argument
with
the
respect
to
the
view
that
any
other
business
that
you
actually
would've
heard
over
the
community.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
though
that
there
--
let's
assume
neither
company
was
failing.and
they
merged
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
may
not
be
a
per
se
violation
(inaudible)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
would
fail
eventually
or
was
about
to
fail?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
--
at
that
time
he
moves
to
tucson,
for
how
long?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
paper
showed
any
inclusions
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
when
--
do
you
think
that
this
was
a
occasion,
36,
it
wasn't
40.
and
if
that
was
40,
it
wasn't
36.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
was
there
any
evidence
that
he
(inaudible)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
there
was
no
other
effort
to
sell.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
pages
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
did
the
company
--
did
the
managing
company
itself
determine
what
the
circulation
expenses
would
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
any
sales
expenses
like
pushing
circulation
or
pushing
advertising
or
pushing
some
subscriptions,
is
that
determined
by
that
company?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
mr.
friedman
we
never
reached
any
of
these
questions
if
this
one
company
was
not
a
failing
company
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
--
are
you
conceding
that
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
you
never
--
you
didn't
--
wouldn't
need
to
waste
any
breath
on
any
of
these
questions
if
this
record
is
clear
that
this
--
that
the
citizen
was
not
a
failing
company.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
we
may
assume
then
i
gather
that
the
government
does
not
claim
and
would
make
no
claim
that
there
would
be
any
connection
between
news
policy
and
this
joint
commercial
operation?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
suppose
the
managing
company
would
do
if
one
of
the
companies
--
if
one
of
the
papers
because
of
its
news
policy,
news
coverage
policy
suddenly
begun
to
decline
in
the
circulation
seriously?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
are
you
reading?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
what
are
the
facts
underlying
that
--
do
you
think
that's
the
state
among
the
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
a
later
motion
to
set
aside
the
one
--
the
section
1
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
based
on
evidences,
they
already
--
they
had
at
that
time
been
taken?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
is
after
all
this
evidence
that
you're
talking
about
was
in
the
record.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it,
your
position
is
that
in
view
of
the
course
this
case
took,
the
fact
of
summary
judgment
was
initially
granted
on
one
part
of
the
case
is
rather
unimportant
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
because
there
was
a
trial
on
other
issues
and
evidence
was
introduced
which
was
very
relevant
to
this
summary
judgment
matter.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
whether
it's
a
viable
economic
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
different
point
in
that
is
whether
it's
viable
defense
in
this
matter.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
view
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
view
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
the
--
it's
impossible
to
predict
whether
or
not
those
statements
may
survive
or
do
you
think
that
the
only
question
is
it's
impossible
to
predict
that
which
one
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
mean
that
it
may
be
that
the
district
--
that
the
district
court
contemplated
that
perhaps
both
could
survive?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
government
doesn't
agree
with
the
tucson
market,
they
would
only
mean
(inaudible)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
circulation
of
both
the
newspapers
active
since
1965
compared
to
1940?
justice
byron
r.
white
each
of
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
roughly
a
correspondent
besides
the
failing
company,
under
the
gross
revenue?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
(inaudible)
--
was
there
a
finding
of
section
7?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
could
there
have
been
an
(inaudible)
failing
company
indication?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
your
claim
was
in
effect
that
there
was
a
merger
in
1940?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
merger
would've
been
subject
to
section
7?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
have
to
get
by
the
failing
company
--
you
would
have
to
--
to
get
by
--
it's
quite
clear
there
was
a
merger
in
1940,
you
would
have
to
get
by
section
7?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
the
--
that
there
was
a
necessity
for
the
court
to
conclude
that
in
1965,
neither
paper
was
failing
in
order
to
find
that
there
was
a
violation
of
section
7?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
there
was
a
finding
of
a
section
7
violation.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
neither
company
was
failing
at
that
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
it's
taken
apart,
if
the
companies
were
separated
it
--
right
now
they
wouldn't
be
a
failing
company
right
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
of
star.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
haven't
primarily
(inaudible)
the
settlement
issue.
i
think
that's
otherwise
a
circulation
(inaudible)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
or
that
--
except
for
the
sunday
edition,
why
should
we
think
that
we
can
do
it
both
the
other

oh,
i
just

that
that

not
you

to
present

justice

did
what
it
did
in
your
argument?
justice
byron

white
you're
really
--
justice
byron

white
--
here
to
do
what
the
court
did
that
it
really,
it
really
perhaps,
(inaudible)
carrying
the
importance
of
the
business.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
make
the
same
argument
with
the
respect
to
the
view
that
any

that
you

would
fail

was
about

and
that

at
that
time
he
moves
to

for
how
long?
justice

white
did
the

showed
any

when

do
you

that

there
was
no
other
effort
to

justice

at

what?
justice
byron

white
and
did
the
company
--
did
the
managing
company
itself
determine
what
the
circulation
expenses
would
be?
justice
byron

white
in
any
sales
expenses
like
pushing
circulation
or
pushing
advertising
or
pushing
some
subscriptions,
is
that
determined
by
that
company?
justice
byron

white
oh,
mr.
friedman
we
never
reached
any
of
these
questions
if
this
one
company
was
not
a
failing
company
--
justice
byron

white
(voice

--
justice
byron

white
you
are

are
you
conceding
that
the

justice

white
well,
i

you
never

you
didn't

wouldn't

you

justice

do
you
view

justice

white
well,
is
that
the
--
it's
impossible
to
predict
whether

not
those

do
you

that

do

(inaudible)

what
was
the

active
since

compared

each

that's
roughly
a

is
that
(inaudible)

justice
byron

white
well,
could
there
have
been
an
(inaudible)
failing

justice

white
so,
your
claim
was
in

that
there
was

justice

white
that
merger
would've

do
you

you

to

it's
quite

there

you

yes,

violation.
justice

white
i
understand
that.
justice
byron

white
so
that
neither

was
failing
at

justice

and
if
