mr.
maclaury,
may
i
ask
one
question,
i
didn't
quite
understand
what
you
said
if
the
court
should
sustain
the
district
court
in
abrogating
those
provisions
of
the
operating
agreement
that
then
this
should
be
a
new
ball
game
and
there
ought
to
be
the
opportunity
before
the
due,
either
to
dispose
of
citizen
or
dispose
of
star?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
--
that's
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
what
is
it
that
--
if
we
sustain
the
district
court
as
to
the
provisions
of
the
operating
agreement,
what
now
precludes
you
having
that
option,
the
divestiture?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
see.
and
what
you're
asking
is
that
you
--
citizen
be
afforded
the
opportunity
to
dispose
of
citizen
or
of
citizen
--
star?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

of
star.
