mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
pan
of
argument
is
to
spend
25
minutes
on
the
opening
and
then
reserve
for
if
the
court
please,
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
this
case
comes
here
from
the
district
court,
in
the
district
of
arizona
on
direct
appeal
under
the
expediting
act.
it
tests
for
the
first
time
the
validity
under
the
antitrust
laws
of
a
newspaper
operating
agreement.
the
agreement
combines
the
commercial
asset
and
the
functions
of
two
newspapers
in
tucson,
arizona,
the
morning,
in
sunday
star
and
the
evening,
citizen.
agreements
of
this
kind
have
become
increasingly
necessary
to
preserve
competition
between
newspapers
on
the
journalistic
level.
the
reason
the
agreement
was
adopted
is
because
tucson
cannot
support
two
newspapers
operating
at
both
the
journalistic
and
the
commercial
levels.
now,
this
situation
is
not
peculiar
to
tucson.
over
the
past
30
or
40
years,
there
has
been
a
drastic
decline
in
the
number
of
separately
owned
newspapers
in
the
same
city.
in
1920,
there
were
552
cities
having
separately
owned
newspapers.
20
years
later
in
1940,
there
were
only
181
and
by
the
mid-sixties,
there
were
65.
and
of
the
65,
more
than
one
third
operated
under
agreements
such
as
we
have
into
consideration
here.
now
the
government
claims
that
this
agreement
is
a
per
se
violation
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
and
the
district
court
on
summary
judgment
held
that
it
was
in
fact
a
violation,
a
per
se
violation
of
section
1.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
agreement
in
substance
and
effect
was
a
merger
and
that
the
court
should've
judged
it
under
the
rule
of
reason
and
specifically
that
it
should
apply
to
this
agreement
the
failing
company
doctrine
because
citizen
in
1940
was
truly
in
a
failing
condition.
now,
we
do
not
seek
here
to
justify
per
se
violations.
the
government
argued
below
and
it
argues
in
its
brief
here
that
all
we
do
is
to
seek
to
justify
per
se
violations.
i
just
like
to
emphasize
to
the
court
that
that
is
not
our
position.
we
feel
that
the
agreement
is
entirely
lawful
and
would've
been
found
lawful
had
it
been
examined
under
the
rule
of
reason
rather
than
on
summary
judgment
and
under
the
per
se
rule.
this
case
involves
a
typical
situation
of
the
economic
conditions
experienced
by
newspapers
throughout
the
country.
in
1940,
citizen
was
in
fact
a
failing
company.
it
did
not
pay
dividends
for
many
years.
its
liabilities
far
exceeded
its
assets
and
it
have
been
kept
alive
in
able
to
pay
its
current
bills
only
by
contributions
from
its
stockholders.
in
contrast
its
competitor,
the
morning
star
was
in
good
financial
condition.
it
was
a
strong
competitor.
it
was
selling
more
than
50%
--
it
sold
more
than
50%
of
the
advertising
in
tucson.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
the
respect
to
circulations
in
1939
were
approximately
2000
a
part.
sun
--
the
daily
circulation,
the
sun
--
the
star
was
approximately
12,000,
the
citizen
approximately,
10,000,
but
in
addition,
star
had
a
12,000
circulation
of
its
sunday
edition
which
citizen
did
not
have.
those
figures
are
approximation
but
there
has
always
been
from
1932
on
through
1939,
a
variation
of
1500
to
1800
up
to
2000
difference
in
its
circulation.
now,
as
i
say
in
contrast
star
was
making
a
profit
and
sold
50%
more
advertising
than
citizen
and
in
the
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
i
would
not
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well,
i
think
it
was
due
in
large
measure
to
the
sunday
edition
but
not
entirely,
mr.
justice
white.
there
was
of
course
available
to
the
star
the
combination
of
rate
between
sunday
and
monday
and
saturday
and
sunday
and
sunday
being
the
unattractive
advertising
day.
it
did
give
star
an
advantage.
now,
in
these
circumstances,
citizen
had
several
choices.
it
could've
ceased
publication
and
shut
down
its
operations
and
sold
equipment
on
the
secondhand
market.
or
it
could've
sold
out
or
merged
with
star.
the
evidence
was
undisputed
that
citizen
in
that
failing
condition
could
not
have
been
sold
to
an
outside
competitor.
of
course
no
outside
competitor
would've
wanted
to
come
in
and
place
itself
in
the
shoes
of
a
failing
company
against
an
established
newspaper
such
as
star.
now
it
took
neither
of
these
courses
but
instead
took
the
third
course
and
that
was
to
enter
into
an
operating
agreement
with
star
which
preserved
for
the
citizens
of
tucson
and
for
these
newspapers,
two
separate
rival,
competing
editorial
voices.
and
it's
our
contention
here
that
that
was
a
far,
far
more
preferable
choice.
a
far
more
preferable
course
of
conduct
than
to
have
merged
entirely
and
shutdown
this
competing
voice
of
citizen.
and
so
they
entered
into
this
operating
agreement
which
was
premised
on
the
basic
economic
back
in
the
newspaper
business
that
newspapers
operate
in
two
levels
as
we
all
know,
at
the
journalistic-editorial
level
and
also
at
a
commercial
level.
by
commercial
i
mean,
running
mechanical
equipment,
the
press,
the
composing
room,
of
the
pricing
and
sale
of
advertising
and
the
circulation
and
establishment
of
circulation
prices
and
the
general
business
affairs
of
the
two
newspapers.
that
is
what
i
refer
to
as
the
commercial
level.
so
the
newspapers
operate
at
both
these
levels,
the
operating
agreement
recognized
that
and
provided
for
what
we
referred
to
as
in
substance
and
effect
a
merger
of
the
commercial
assets
--
of
the
assets
devoted
for
the
commercial
functions
as
well
as
the
personnel,
records
and
all
of
the
material
devoted
in
use
at
the
commercial
level
of
these
two
businesses.
but
on
the
other
hand,
the
separate
identities
of
star
and
citizen
will
retain
and
the
provision
in
the
agreement
specify
that
star
and
citizen
would
continue
to
be
published
separately
and
the
court
find
--
found
that
ever
since
the
agreement
indeed,
star
and
citizen
have
continued
in
rival
composition
of
news
and
editorial
materials
and
have
developed
into
two
high
quality
newspapers.
the
agreement
was
patterned
after
to
what
we
refer
to
as
the
albuquerque
agreement
which
was
then
in
effect
and
is
still
in
effect,
stopped
at
1933.
the
purpose
of
the
operating
agreement
was
to
merge
these
commercial
functions
and
assets
so
to
support
two
separate
news
and
editorial
voices.
to
do
this,
the
parties
didn't
really
see
three
things.
first,
each
newspaper
acquired
in
joint
interest
in
the
assets
of
the
other
newspaper
necessary
to
produce
newspapers.
secondly,
they
organized
a
third
corporation
which
was
called
tucson
newspaper
inc.,
we
refer
to
it
as
tni.
and
thirdly,
tni
then
fickle
with
a
management
and
control
of
these
assets,
they
operated
the
press
room,
the
composing
room,
and
other
mechanical
equipment.
they
sold
advertising
space
in
both
newspapers.
they
established
advertising
rates.
they
circulated
the
newspapers,
operated
the
distribution
trucks
and
established
the
circulation
rates.
star
and
citizen
each
own
equal
shares
in
it's
--
in
the
third
corporation
tni
and
the
board
of
directors
of
tni
or
by
the
number,
three
appointed
by
star,
substance
and
two
by
citizen.
but
the
management
of
tni
was
completely
separate
from
the
management
of
the
editors
and
the
publishing
people
of
the
two
newspapers,
it
was
a
separate
management,
they
had
a
separate
general
manager,
a
separate
comptroller,
separate
man
who
headed
the
advertising
department,
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
editorial
levels
of
the
two
newspapers
of
the
separate
operation.
we
are
urged
--
the
district
court
because
that
this
was
a
--
in
effect,
substance
in
effect
a
merger
or
a
consolidation
to
judge
the
agreement
under
the
rule
or
reason.
but
this
it
refused
to
do.
it
was
the
district
court's
view
that
the
failing
company
doctrine
would've
applied
in
this
situation
if
star
had
acquired
citizen
outright
and
published
both
newspapers
as
a
single
owner.
as
the
--
the
court
ruled
in
effect
that
the
transaction
would
not
have
been
unlawful
if
the
newspapers
had
gone
further
than
they
did
and
eliminated
all
news
and
editorial
rivalry.
now,
we
do
not
urge
that
the
fact
that
this
case
deals
with
newspapers
exempts
the
activity
--
trust
laws
but
we
do
urge
that
the
district
court
interpret
the
sherman
--
the
elimination
of
a
separate
and
effective
editorial
voice
--
that
there
was
a
separate
voice.
that
they
were
competing
editorial
voices
in
tucson
should
have
been
a
factor
that
the
court
should've
taken
under
consideration
in
deciding
whether
or
not
this
agreement
was
unreasonable.
it
was
the
benefit
to
the
community,
arriving
from
separate
editorial
voices
is
a
factor
that
the
court
should've
taken
into
consideration
but
on
the
con
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
we
do
not
claim
here
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well,
yes,
it
is
a
first
amendment
consideration
because
the
court
had
the
choice
here
of
interpreting
the
sherman
act
so
as
to
permit
two
separate
editorial
voices.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
we
urge
below
--
we
urged
below,
we
do
not
urge
here
but
we
did
urge
below
that
if
the
court
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
yes
but
our
argument
was
that
here
the
court
said,
it
will
be
perfectly
lawful.
you
could've
put
these
two
newspapers
together
and
shut
down
one
voice
and
in
that
event
the
sherman
act
would
not
have
been
violated.
but
it
interpret
the
sherman
act
to
have
been
violated
if
we
kept
one
voice
alive
and
in
--
we
argued
below
that
the
court
then
was
interpreting
the
sherman
act
so
as
to
violate
the
first
amendment
or
deprive
the
citizens
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
--
of
a
first
amendment
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
that
--
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
oh,
i
think
that
that's
correct.
i
think
that
this
is
a
factor.
we
argued
here
this
is
a
factor
that
should've
been
taken
into
consideration
under
the
rule
of
reason.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
yes
sir.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
assume
we
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
there
was
a
serious
and
a
genuine
issue
of
fact
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
we
filed
numerous
affidavits
and
the
intent
of
all
of
them
was
that
this
was
a
merger.
the
--
that
was
the
primary
issue
of
fact,
a
disputed
issue
of
fact
which
the
court
ignored
on
motion
for
summary
judgment.
now,
thereafter,
this
case
would
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
it
was
an
agreement
for
a
term
of
years
but
in
addition
the
agreement
could
not
have
been
dissolved
except
upon
the
consent
of
both
parties.
technically,
your
honor,
you
are
absolutely
correct,
it
is
--
it
was
not
technically
a
merger
or
a
consolidation
but
in
terms
of
the
economic
realities,
it
was
a
merger.
it
was
a
merger,
it
had
no
difference
or
no
more
of
effect
or
no
less
an
effect
upon
the
commercial
market,
the
advertising
market
than
would
a
full
and
complete
statutory
merger
had
had.
and
of
course
we
--
and
certainly
we
all
agree
on
both
sides
of
this
case
that
the
sherman
act
does
deal
with
economic
realities
and
with
substance
rather
than
form.
now,
the
government
charged
that
this
agreement
constituted
price
fixing
and
profit
pooling
and
market
allocation
and
therefore
illegal
per
se.
now,
i
believe
that
the
complete
answer
to
these
charges
is
that
the
owners
of
star
and
citizen
are
doing
nothing
today
and
did
nothing
after
the
agreement
was
entered
into
1940.
it
did
nothing,
than
they
would've
been
doing
had
there
been
a
complete
merger.
and
certainly
if
there
had
been
a
complete
merger
of
both
the
editorial
and
the
commercial
functions
the
government
would
be
in
no
position,
it
would
be
perfectly
clear
that
the
government
would
be
in
position
to
argue
that
that
was
a
per
se
violation.
by
price
fixing,
all
the
government
simply
means
is
that
this
tni
organization
established
the
price
for
its
products
and
services.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
i
don't
think
we'd
have
very
much
trouble
at
all
your
honor.
the
fact,
the
very
fact
that
citizen
was
failing
in
1940
could
not
have
been
--
could
not
be
reconstituted,
rehabilitated
after
years.
that
would
cause
citizen
to
fail
again
is
the
reason
we're
here.
it's
the
basis
for
our
argument.
and
without
that
fact
situation,
i
don't
think
we
would
have
a
case.
it
is
because
one
newspaper
would
fail
without
or
having
taken
this
act
that
we
believe
the
district
court
committed
error.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
back
in
1940
as
i
say,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
it,
citizen
was
clearly
a
failing
company
within
the
meaning
of
international
shield.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
i
don't
believe
so
mr.
justice
white.
the
district
court
found
in
finding
17
or
i'll
say
concluded
in
finding
17
that
citizen
was
not
in
1940
on
the
verge
of
going
out
of
business.
and
that
it
would
not
have
ceased
publication
but
for
the
opportunity
offered
in
this
operating
agreement.
now
i
do
not
consider
that
to
be
a
finding
to
finance
the
losses
for
some
little
out
of
this
own
pocket,
that's
in
finding
14.
but
the
evidence
also
had
to
find
another
source
of
resources
in
order
to
keep
citizen
alive.
now
and
i
take
that
situation
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
he
had
moved
to
tucson
i
believe
in
about
september
of
1939
and
had
given
his
full
time
and
attention
to
the
business
without
a
salary
for
about
six
months.
the
court
found
in
findings
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
no,
the
newspaper
didn't
--
did
not
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
continued
to
fail
and
fail
to
deteriorate.
in
december
of
1939,
the
current
liabilities
of
citizen
were
$47,000.00.its
assets,
current
assets
were
$16,500.00.
its
total
liabilities
in
nine
--
in
december
of
39,
exceeded
total
assets
by
$53,000.00.
its
total
assets
were
$80,000.00.
now
by
march
of
1940,
its
total
liabilities
exceeded
assets
by
$81,000.00
and
its
total
assets
had
declined
from
$80,000.00
to
$54,000.00.
and
by
june
of
1940
just
before
the
operating
agreement
went
into
effect,
the
total
assets
of
citizen
had
declined
further
from
$54,000.00,
the
previous
march,
to
$47,000.00.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
no,
i
think
it
was
in
worst
shape
in
1940
than
it
was
in
1936.in
1936,
mr.
small
and
a
mr.
johnson
acquired
a
newspaper
from
the
chicago
state.
they
acquired
it
for
a
$100,000.00
which
they
paid
over
a
period
of
time.
at
that
time
they
put
$25,000.00
into
new
capital.
the
debts
of
the
corporation
at
that
time
were
approximately
$7500.00.
by
1940,
the
debts
of
the
corporation
were
a
$109,000.00
and
$79,000.00
of
this
was
due
to
its
stockholders
which
represented
the
new
money
put
in
to
the
enterprise
via
stock
bonus
so
clearly
citizen
was
steadily
declining
financially
from
1936
through
1940.
and
by
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
there
was
an
effort
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
he
understood
what
its
financial
condition
was
in
1936.
he
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
there
wasn't
--
not
an
effort
to
sell
outright
mr.
justice
white.
there
was
an
effort
by
mr.
small
to
acquire
new
financing
from
people
interested
in
newspapers
and
in
the
publishing
business,
people
that
he
knew
and
this
efforts
fail.
he
was
a
very
poor
season
to
be
investing
in
newspaper
in
arizona
at
the
time.
having
failed
to
attract
new
investment
money,
he
then
renewed
his
conversations
with
matthews,
owner
of
the
star
to
enter
into
or
make
some
kind
of
an
arrangement
for
this
operation,
operating
agreement.
i
might
point
out
here
that
the
undisputed
testimony
at
the
trial
was
that
citizen
could
not
have
been
sold
in
1940
to
an
outside
publisher
who
had
any
expectation
of
operating
a
newspaper
out
of
profit.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well,
in
1965
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
no
you,
you're
not
correct
mr.
justice
harlan
on
the
termination
date,
65
was
not
the
termination
date,
65
was
the
date
of
the
year
that
the
complaint
was
filed.
it
still
have
some
years
to
run
but
the
evidence
was
that
in
a
form
of
a
focal
misstatement
prepared
by
a
national
accounting
firm,
the
evidence
was
that
citizen
and
star
as
newspapers
were
healthy,
company

--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
the
termination
date
had
been
such
[audio

1993
i
believe
but
there
was
a
provision
that
they
have
a
specific
termination
date
unless
both
parties
at
the
end
of
each
25-year
period
would
agree
to
terminate
it.
the
evidence
--
let's
go
the
question,
the
evidence
was
that
[audio

65,
if
this
agreement
should
be
abrogated
in
the
sense
that
the
district
court
ordered
it
that
citizen
would
promptly
again
flunk
towards
a
company
for
the
years
62,
63
and
64,
a
test
period.
the
evidence
was
and
it
was
undisputed
that
citizen
would
lose
on
the
average
of
$75,000.00
a
year.
star
was
in
a
far
stronger
position
and
would've
earned
between
450
and
$500,000.00.
i
see
my
25
minutes
is
up
and
i
would
if
the
court
please
[audio
cut]
minute
for
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
if
the
court
please,
we
do
not
ask
here
for
a
special
rule
for
newspapers.
the
--
we
suggest
here
is
that
where
there
has
been
a
partial
merger
or
a
partial
consolidation
of
the
assets
and
the
personnel
of
a
two
firms
which
preserves
to
that
community
competition
which
otherwise
would
fail
that
rule
should
apply
regardless
of
the
business
that
we're
talking
about.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
competition
mr.
justice
between
the
news
and
editorial
composition
between
the
two
newspapers.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
the
competition
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
yes
sir,
the
competition
is
seeking
advertising,
circulation
and
pricing
that
has
--
there
is
no
competition
under
this
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
--
under
this
arrangement
just
as
there
would
be
under
any
merger.
just
as
there
would
under
any
merger
and
we
suggest
that
the
owners
of
star
and
citizen
are
not
doing
a
thing
here,
this
operation
that
they
wouldn't
be
doing
under
a
complete
and
total
merger.
the
only
thing
that
they
have
done
that
they
have
saved
this
benefit
to
the
community
of
two
rival
high
quality
newspapers
as
the
court
found.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
that
is
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
that
--
that
as
the
situation
is
today
but
mr.
justice
i
would
not
agree
that
it
has
been
suppressed
because
in
1940,
although
these
witnesses
testified
as
laymen,
the
owners
of
star
and
citizen
that
they
intended
to
eliminate
competition
as
they
say
that
was
the
testimony
of
laymen.
they
were
not
a
taking
of
testimony
as
an
economist
would
or
an
antitrust
lawyer
would.
they
were
not
thinking
of
effective
competition.
what
they
were
talking
about
was
the
end
of
a
long
hopeless
struggle
between
these
two
newspapers
which
had
finally
ended
in
one
of
them
being
in
a
failing
condition.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
i
would
like
to
answer
that
by
first
going
to
1940
and
then
1965
if
i
may
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
there
is
no
question
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
there
is
absolutely
no
question
mr.
justice
black
that
they're
after
this
agreement,
there
was
no
competition
whatsoever
on
the
circulation
or
advertising
level.
i
just
simply
wanted
to
add
mr.
justice
black
that
before
1940
there
was
an
effective
competition
in
the
antitrust
sense
on
that
level
because
the
only
thing
that
kept
citizen
in
the
market
was
not
the
earnings
that
it
derived
from
competing
with
star
but
the
earnings
that
were
--
that
what
the
moneys
that
were
put
into
that
newspaper
out
of
mr.
small's
pocket,
out
of
his
resources
from
other
areas.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
they
were
getting
some.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
they
were
getting
some
but
not
sufficient
to
keep
that
company
liable.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
after
this
operating
agreement,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
now
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
one
--
to
another
point
here
and
that
is
the
solicitor
general's
intention
here
that
the
court
found
that
citizen
was
not
a
failing
company.
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
district
court
made
no
such
finding.
such
a
finding
under
the
theory
that
this
case
was
tried
would've
been
entirely
superfluous
and
irrelevant
because
the
court
eliminated
in
this
trial
any
and
all
section
1
issues
and
at
the
end
of
the
trial
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
pan
of
argument
is
to
spend
25
minutes
on
the
opening
and
then
reserve
for
if
the
court
please,
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
this
case
comes
here
from
the
district
court,
in
the
district
of
arizona
on
direct
appeal
under
the
expediting
act.
it
tests
for
the
first
time
the
validity
under
the
antitrust
laws
of
a
newspaper
operating
agreement.
the
agreement
combines
the
commercial
asset
and
the
functions
of
two
newspapers
in
tucson,
arizona,
the
morning,
in
sunday
star
and
the
evening,
citizen.
agreements
of
this
kind
have
become
increasingly
necessary
to
preserve
competition
between
newspapers
on
the
journalistic
level.
the
reason
the
agreement
was
adopted
is
because
tucson
cannot
support
two
newspapers
operating
at
both
the
journalistic
and
the
commercial
levels.
now,
this
situation
is
not
peculiar
to
tucson.
over
the
past
30
or
40
years,
there
has
been
a
drastic
decline
in
the
number
of
separately
owned
newspapers
in
the
same
city.
in
1920,
there
were
552
cities
having
separately
owned
newspapers.
20
years
later
in
1940,
there
were
only
181
and
by
the
mid-sixties,
there
were
65.
and
of
the
65,
more
than
one
third
operated
under
agreements
such
as
we
have
into
consideration
here.
now
the
government
claims
that
this
agreement
is
a
per
se
violation
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
and
the
district
court
on
summary
judgment
held
that
it
was
in
fact
a
violation,
a
per
se
violation
of
section
1.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
agreement
in
substance
and
effect
was
a
merger
and
that
the
court
should've
judged
it
under
the
rule
of
reason
and
specifically
that
it
should
apply
to
this
agreement
the
failing
company
doctrine
because
citizen
in
1940
was
truly
in
a
failing
condition.
now,
we
do
not
seek
here
to
justify
per
se
violations.
the
government
argued
below
and
it
argues
in
its
brief
here
that
all
we
do
is
to
seek
to
justify
per
se
violations.
i
just
like
to
emphasize
to
the
court
that
that
is
not
our
position.
we
feel
that
the
agreement
is
entirely
lawful
and
would've
been
found
lawful
had
it
been
examined
under
the
rule
of
reason
rather
than
on
summary
judgment
and
under
the
per
se
rule.
this
case
involves
a
typical
situation
of
the
economic
conditions
experienced
by
newspapers
throughout
the
country.
in
1940,
citizen
was
in
fact
a
failing
company.
it
did
not
pay
dividends
for
many
years.
its
liabilities
far
exceeded
its
assets
and
it
have
been
kept
alive
in
able
to
pay
its
current
bills
only
by
contributions
from
its
stockholders.
in
contrast
its
competitor,
the
morning
star
was
in
good
financial
condition.
it
was
a
strong
competitor.
it
was
selling
more
than
50%
--
it
sold
more
than
50%
of
the
advertising
in
tucson.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
the
respect
to
circulations
in
1939
were
approximately
2000
a
part.
sun
--
the
daily
circulation,
the
sun
--
the
star
was
approximately
12,000,
the
citizen
approximately,
10,000,
but
in
addition,
star
had
a
12,000
circulation
of
its
sunday
edition
which
citizen
did
not
have.
those
figures
are
approximation
but
there
has
always
been
from
1932
on
through
1939,
a
variation
of
1500
to
1800
up
to
2000
difference
in
its
circulation.
now,
as
i
say
in
contrast
star
was
making
a
profit
and
sold
50%
more
advertising
than
citizen
and
in
the
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
i
would
not
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well,
i
think
it
was
due
in
large
measure
to
the
sunday
edition
but
not
entirely,
mr.
justice
white.
there
was
of
course
available
to
the
star
the
combination
of
rate
between
sunday
and
monday
and
saturday
and
sunday
and
sunday
being
the
unattractive
advertising
day.
it
did
give
star
an
advantage.
now,
in
these
circumstances,
citizen
had
several
choices.
it
could've
ceased
publication
and
shut
down
its
operations
and
sold
equipment
on
the
secondhand
market.
or
it
could've
sold
out
or
merged
with
star.
the
evidence
was
undisputed
that
citizen
in
that
failing
condition
could
not
have
been
sold
to
an
outside
competitor.
of
course
no
outside
competitor
would've
wanted
to
come
in
and
place
itself
in
the
shoes
of
a
failing
company
against
an
established
newspaper
such
as
star.
now
it
took
neither
of
these
courses
but
instead
took
the
third
course
and
that
was
to
enter
into
an
operating
agreement
with
star
which
preserved
for
the
citizens
of
tucson
and
for
these
newspapers,
two
separate
rival,
competing
editorial
voices.
and
it's
our
contention
here
that
that
was
a
far,
far
more
preferable
choice.
a
far
more
preferable
course
of
conduct
than
to
have
merged
entirely
and
shutdown
this
competing
voice
of
citizen.
and
so
they
entered
into
this
operating
agreement
which
was
premised
on
the
basic
economic
back
in
the
newspaper
business
that
newspapers
operate
in
two
levels
as
we
all
know,
at
the
journalistic-editorial
level
and
also
at
a
commercial
level.
by
commercial
i
mean,
running
mechanical
equipment,
the
press,
the
composing
room,
of
the
pricing
and
sale
of
advertising
and
the
circulation
and
establishment
of
circulation
prices
and
the
general
business
affairs
of
the
two
newspapers.
that
is
what
i
refer
to
as
the
commercial
level.
so
the
newspapers
operate
at
both
these
levels,
the
operating
agreement
recognized
that
and
provided
for
what
we
referred
to
as
in
substance
and
effect
a
merger
of
the
commercial
assets
--
of
the
assets
devoted
for
the
commercial
functions
as
well
as
the
personnel,
records
and
all
of
the
material
devoted
in
use
at
the
commercial
level
of
these
two
businesses.
but
on
the
other
hand,
the
separate
identities
of
star
and
citizen
will
retain
and
the
provision
in
the
agreement
specify
that
star
and
citizen
would
continue
to
be
published
separately
and
the
court
find
--
found
that
ever
since
the
agreement
indeed,
star
and
citizen
have
continued
in
rival
composition
of
news
and
editorial
materials
and
have
developed
into
two
high
quality
newspapers.
the
agreement
was
patterned
after
to
what
we
refer
to
as
the
albuquerque
agreement
which
was
then
in
effect
and
is
still
in
effect,
stopped
at
1933.
the
purpose
of
the
operating
agreement
was
to
merge
these
commercial
functions
and
assets
so
to
support
two
separate
news
and
editorial
voices.
to
do
this,
the
parties
didn't
really
see
three
things.
first,
each
newspaper
acquired
in
joint
interest
in
the
assets
of
the
other
newspaper
necessary
to
produce
newspapers.
secondly,
they
organized
a
third
corporation
which
was
called
tucson
newspaper
inc.,
we
refer
to
it
as
tni.
and
thirdly,
tni
then
fickle
with
a
management
and
control
of
these
assets,
they
operated
the
press
room,
the
composing
room,
and
other
mechanical
equipment.
they
sold
advertising
space
in
both
newspapers.
they
established
advertising
rates.
they
circulated
the
newspapers,
operated
the
distribution
trucks
and
established
the
circulation
rates.
star
and
citizen
each
own
equal
shares
in
it's
--
in
the
third
corporation
tni
and
the
board
of
directors
of
tni
or
by
the
number,
three
appointed
by
star,
substance
and
two
by
citizen.
but
the
management
of
tni
was
completely
separate
from
the
management
of
the
editors
and
the
publishing
people
of
the
two
newspapers,
it
was
a
separate
management,
they
had
a
separate
general
manager,
a
separate
comptroller,
separate
man
who
headed
the
advertising
department,
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
editorial
levels
of
the
two
newspapers
of
the
separate
operation.
we
are
urged
--
the
district
court
because
that
this
was
a
--
in
effect,
substance
in
effect
a
merger
or
a
consolidation
to
judge
the
agreement
under
the
rule
or
reason.
but
this
it
refused
to
do.
it
was
the
district
court's
view
that
the
failing
company
doctrine
would've
applied
in
this
situation
if
star
had
acquired
citizen
outright
and
published
both
newspapers
as
a
single
owner.
as
the
--
the
court
ruled
in
effect
that
the
transaction
would
not
have
been
unlawful
if
the
newspapers
had
gone
further
than
they
did
and
eliminated
all
news
and
editorial
rivalry.
now,
we
do
not
urge
that
the
fact
that
this
case
deals
with
newspapers
exempts
the
activity
--
trust
laws
but
we
do
urge
that
the
district
court
interpret
the
sherman
--
the
elimination
of
a
separate
and
effective
editorial
voice
--
that
there
was
a
separate
voice.
that
they
were
competing
editorial
voices
in
tucson
should
have
been
a
factor
that
the
court
should've
taken
under
consideration
in
deciding
whether
or
not
this
agreement
was
unreasonable.
it
was
the
benefit
to
the
community,
arriving
from
separate
editorial
voices
is
a
factor
that
the
court
should've
taken
into
consideration
but
on
the
con
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
we
do
not
claim
here
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well,
yes,
it
is
a
first
amendment
consideration
because
the
court
had
the
choice
here
of
interpreting
the
sherman
act
so
as
to
permit
two
separate
editorial
voices.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
we
urge
below
--
we
urged
below,
we
do
not
urge
here
but
we
did
urge
below
that
if
the
court
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
yes
but
our
argument
was
that
here
the
court
said,
it
will
be
perfectly
lawful.
you
could've
put
these
two
newspapers
together
and
shut
down
one
voice
and
in
that
event
the
sherman
act
would
not
have
been
violated.
but
it
interpret
the
sherman
act
to
have
been
violated
if
we
kept
one
voice
alive
and
in
--
we
argued
below
that
the
court
then
was
interpreting
the
sherman
act
so
as
to
violate
the
first
amendment
or
deprive
the
citizens
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
--
of
a
first
amendment
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
that
--
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
oh,
i
think
that
that's
correct.
i
think
that
this
is
a
factor.
we
argued
here
this
is
a
factor
that
should've
been
taken
into
consideration
under
the
rule
of
reason.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
yes
sir.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
assume
we
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
there
was
a
serious
and
a
genuine
issue
of
fact
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
we
filed
numerous
affidavits
and
the
intent
of
all
of
them
was
that
this
was
a
merger.
the
--
that
was
the
primary
issue
of
fact,
a
disputed
issue
of
fact
which
the
court
ignored
on
motion
for
summary
judgment.
now,
thereafter,
this
case
would
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
it
was
an
agreement
for
a
term
of
years
but
in
addition
the
agreement
could
not
have
been
dissolved
except
upon
the
consent
of
both
parties.
technically,
your
honor,
you
are
absolutely
correct,
it
is
--
it
was
not
technically
a
merger
or
a
consolidation
but
in
terms
of
the
economic
realities,
it
was
a
merger.
it
was
a
merger,
it
had
no
difference
or
no
more
of
effect
or
no
less
an
effect
upon
the
commercial
market,
the
advertising
market
than
would
a
full
and
complete
statutory
merger
had
had.
and
of
course
we
--
and
certainly
we
all
agree
on
both
sides
of
this
case
that
the
sherman
act
does
deal
with
economic
realities
and
with
substance
rather
than
form.
now,
the
government
charged
that
this
agreement
constituted
price
fixing
and
profit
pooling
and
market
allocation
and
therefore
illegal
per
se.
now,
i
believe
that
the
complete
answer
to
these
charges
is
that
the
owners
of
star
and
citizen
are
doing
nothing
today
and
did
nothing
after
the
agreement
was
entered
into
1940.
it
did
nothing,
than
they
would've
been
doing
had
there
been
a
complete
merger.
and
certainly
if
there
had
been
a
complete
merger
of
both
the
editorial
and
the
commercial
functions
the
government
would
be
in
no
position,
it
would
be
perfectly
clear
that
the
government
would
be
in
position
to
argue
that
that
was
a
per
se
violation.
by
price
fixing,
all
the
government
simply
means
is
that
this
tni
organization
established
the
price
for
its
products
and
services.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
i
don't
think
we'd
have
very
much
trouble
at
all
your
honor.
the
fact,
the
very
fact
that
citizen
was
failing
in
1940
could
not
have
been
--
could
not
be
reconstituted,
rehabilitated
after
years.
that
would
cause
citizen
to
fail
again
is
the
reason
we're
here.
it's
the
basis
for
our
argument.
and
without
that
fact
situation,
i
don't
think
we
would
have
a
case.
it
is
because
one
newspaper
would
fail
without
or
having
taken
this
act
that
we
believe
the
district
court
committed
error.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
back
in
1940
as
i
say,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
it,
citizen
was
clearly
a
failing
company
within
the
meaning
of
international
shield.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
i
don't
believe
so
mr.
justice
white.
the
district
court
found
in
finding
17
or
i'll
say
concluded
in
finding
17
that
citizen
was
not
in
1940
on
the
verge
of
going
out
of
business.
and
that
it
would
not
have
ceased
publication
but
for
the
opportunity
offered
in
this
operating
agreement.
now
i
do
not
consider
that
to
be
a
finding
to
finance
the
losses
for
some
little
out
of
this
own
pocket,
that's
in
finding
14.
but
the
evidence
also
had
to
find
another
source
of
resources
in
order
to
keep
citizen
alive.
now
and
i
take
that
situation
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
he
had
moved
to
tucson
i
believe
in
about
september
of
1939
and
had
given
his
full
time
and
attention
to
the
business
without
a
salary
for
about
six
months.
the
court
found
in
findings
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
no,
the
newspaper
didn't
--
did
not
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
continued
to
fail
and
fail
to
deteriorate.
in
december
of
1939,
the
current
liabilities
of
citizen
were
$47,000.00.its
assets,
current
assets
were
$16,500.00.
its
total
liabilities
in
nine
--
in
december
of
39,
exceeded
total
assets
by
$53,000.00.
its
total
assets
were
$80,000.00.
now
by
march
of
1940,
its
total
liabilities
exceeded
assets
by
$81,000.00
and
its
total
assets
had
declined
from
$80,000.00
to
$54,000.00.
and
by
june
of
1940
just
before
the
operating
agreement
went
into
effect,
the
total
assets
of
citizen
had
declined
further
from
$54,000.00,
the
previous
march,
to
$47,000.00.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
no,
i
think
it
was
in
worst
shape
in
1940
than
it
was
in
1936.in
1936,
mr.
small
and
a
mr.
johnson
acquired
a
newspaper
from
the
chicago
state.
they
acquired
it
for
a
$100,000.00
which
they
paid
over
a
period
of
time.
at
that
time
they
put
$25,000.00
into
new
capital.
the
debts
of
the
corporation
at
that
time
were
approximately
$7500.00.
by
1940,
the
debts
of
the
corporation
were
a
$109,000.00
and
$79,000.00
of
this
was
due
to
its
stockholders
which
represented
the
new
money
put
in
to
the
enterprise
via
stock
bonus
so
clearly
citizen
was
steadily
declining
financially
from
1936
through
1940.
and
by
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
there
was
an
effort
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
he
understood
what
its
financial
condition
was
in
1936.
he
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
there
wasn't
--
not
an
effort
to
sell
outright
mr.
justice
white.
there
was
an
effort
by
mr.
small
to
acquire
new
financing
from
people
interested
in
newspapers
and
in
the
publishing
business,
people
that
he
knew
and
this
efforts
fail.
he
was
a
very
poor
season
to
be
investing
in
newspaper
in
arizona
at
the
time.
having
failed
to
attract
new
investment
money,
he
then
renewed
his
conversations
with
matthews,
owner
of
the
star
to
enter
into
or
make
some
kind
of
an
arrangement
for
this
operation,
operating
agreement.
i
might
point
out
here
that
the
undisputed
testimony
at
the
trial
was
that
citizen
could
not
have
been
sold
in
1940
to
an
outside
publisher
who
had
any
expectation
of
operating
a
newspaper
out
of
profit.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well,
in
1965
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
no
you,
you're
not
correct
mr.
justice
harlan
on
the
termination
date,
65
was
not
the
termination
date,
65
was
the
date
of
the
year
that
the
complaint
was
filed.
it
still
have
some
years
to
run
but
the
evidence
was
that
in
a
form
of
a
focal
misstatement
prepared
by
a
national
accounting
firm,
the
evidence
was
that
citizen
and
star
as
newspapers
were
healthy,
company
[audio
cut]
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
the
termination
date
had
been
such
[audio
cut]
1993
i
believe
but
there
was
a
provision
that
they
have
a
specific
termination
date
unless
both
parties
at
the
end
of
each
25-year
period
would
agree
to
terminate
it.
the
evidence
--
let's
go
the
question,
the
evidence
was
that
[audio
cut]
65,
if
this
agreement
should
be
abrogated
in
the
sense
that
the
district
court
ordered
it
that
citizen
would
promptly
again
flunk
towards
a
company
for
the
years
62,
63
and
64,
a
test
period.
the
evidence
was
and
it
was
undisputed
that
citizen
would
lose
on
the
average
of
$75,000.00
a
year.
star
was
in
a
far
stronger
position
and
would've
earned
between
450
and
$500,000.00.
i
see
my
25
minutes
is
up
and
i
would
if
the
court
please
[audio
cut]
minute
for
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
if
the
court
please,
we
do
not
ask
here
for
a
special
rule
for
newspapers.
the
--
we
suggest
here
is
that
where
there
has
been
a
partial
merger
or
a
partial
consolidation
of
the
assets
and
the
personnel
of
a
two
firms
which
preserves
to
that
community
competition
which
otherwise
would
fail
that
rule
should
apply
regardless
of
the
business
that
we're
talking
about.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
competition
mr.
justice
between
the
news
and
editorial
composition
between
the
two
newspapers.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
the
competition
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
yes
sir,
the
competition
is
seeking
advertising,
circulation
and
pricing
that
has
--
there
is
no
competition
under
this
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
--
under
this
arrangement
just
as
there
would
be
under
any
merger.
just
as
there
would
under
any
merger
and
we
suggest
that
the
owners
of
star
and
citizen
are
not
doing
a
thing
here,
this
operation
that
they
wouldn't
be
doing
under
a
complete
and
total
merger.
the
only
thing
that
they
have
done
that
they
have
saved
this
benefit
to
the
community
of
two
rival
high
quality
newspapers
as
the
court
found.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
that
is
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
that
--
that
as
the
situation
is
today
but
mr.
justice
i
would
not
agree
that
it
has
been
suppressed
because
in
1940,
although
these
witnesses
testified
as
laymen,
the
owners
of
star
and
citizen
that
they
intended
to
eliminate
competition
as
they
say
that
was
the
testimony
of
laymen.
they
were
not
a
taking
of
testimony
as
an
economist
would
or
an
antitrust
lawyer
would.
they
were
not
thinking
of
effective
competition.
what
they
were
talking
about
was
the
end
of
a
long
hopeless
struggle
between
these
two
newspapers
which
had
finally
ended
in
one
of
them
being
in
a
failing
condition.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
i
would
like
to
answer
that
by
first
going
to
1940
and
then
1965
if
i
may
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
there
is
no
question
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
there
is
absolutely
no
question
mr.
justice
black
that
they're
after
this
agreement,
there
was
no
competition
whatsoever
on
the
circulation
or
advertising
level.
i
just
simply
wanted
to
add
mr.
justice
black
that
before
1940
there
was
an
effective
competition
in
the
antitrust
sense
on
that
level
because
the
only
thing
that
kept
citizen
in
the
market
was
not
the
earnings
that
it
derived
from
competing
with
star
but
the
earnings
that
were
--
that
what
the
moneys
that
were
put
into
that
newspaper
out
of
mr.
small's
pocket,
out
of
his
resources
from
other
areas.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
they
were
getting
some.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
they
were
getting
some
but
not
sufficient
to
keep
that
company
liable.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
after
this
operating
agreement,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
now
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
one
--
to
another
point
here
and
that
is
the
solicitor
general's
intention
here
that
the
court
found
that
citizen
was
not
a
failing
company.
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
district
court
made
no
such
finding.
such
a
finding
under
the
theory
that
this
case
was
tried
would've
been
entirely
superfluous
and
irrelevant
because
the
court
eliminated
in
this
trial
any
and
all
section
1
issues
and
at
the
end
of
the
trial
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
that
is
correct
your
honor.
