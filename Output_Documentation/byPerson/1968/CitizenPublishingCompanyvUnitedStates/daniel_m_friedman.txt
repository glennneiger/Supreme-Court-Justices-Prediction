mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
found
in
this
case
in
finding
number
20,
page
74
of
the
record
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
parties
to
the
operating
agreement
to
reduce
costs
and
increase
profits
by
eliminating
commercial
competition
between
star
and
the
citizen
while
retaining
separate
editorial
and
news
departments.
in
their
agreement
to
reduce
costs
and
in
four
on
the
same
page
they
speak
of
what
they
did
in
furtherance
of
their
intent
to
eliminate
competition
between
the
two
papers.
moreover,
both
of
the
parties
conceded
at
the
trial
that
this
was
the
purpose
of
the
operating
agreement.
mr.
matthews
who
was
the
owner
of
the
star
stated
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
agreement
to
end
commercial
competition
between
star
and
citizen.
this
is
at
page
194
of
the
record.
mr.
small
sr.
would
then
who
was
the
owner
of
the
citizen
said
the
same
thing.
a
mr.
chambers
who
had
been
the
business
and
edit
and
advertising
manager
of
the
star
in
1940
and
who
had
participated
in
the
negotiations
leading
to
the
joint
operating
agreement,
he
stated
at
page
155
of
the
record
when
he
was
asked
as
the
--
whether
as
the
result
of
this
tucson
newspapers,
inc.
was
there
any
competition
remaining
between
the
star
with
respect
to
the
business
aspect,
he
said,
"we
tried
to
make
it
not
so.
i
don't
think
that
there
was."
and
then
he
later
--
a
few
pages
later
at
page
158
of
the
record
he
was
asked
whether
this
arrangement
could've
worked
if
the
revenues
had
been
divided
on
some
method
other
than
a
fixed
formula
which
i
will
come
to
in
a
minute
and
he
said,
"no."
he
didn't
think
it
would.
he
said
that
that
was
--
would've
defeated
all
the
idea
we
had
for
accomplishing
this
unification.
we
were
trying,
he
said,
"i
guess
that
competition
is
a
nasty
word
in
this
court
but
we
were
trying
to
eliminate
the
competition
between
the
two
of
us."
that's
all.
now,
in
addition
to
this
testimony
at
the
trial
we
had
in
this
record
a
rather
unusual
document
which
is
government
exhibit
number
26
which
was
a
submission
that
the
star
made
in
1947
to
the
internal
revenue
service
in
support
of
excess
profits
tax
relief
for
the
more
years.
and
i
have
to
read
to
the
court
a
couple
of
the
things
that
the
star
said
in
this
document
about
the
purpose
of
the
1940
agreement.
in
page
409
they
said,
it
is
obvious
that
the
aim
and
purpose
of
the
parties
was
to
destroy
every
vestige
of
the
competition
that
existed
on
january
1,
1940.
then
at
pages
420
and
421
they
say
in
order
to
preserve
perpetual
elimination
of
competition
the
operate
agreements
provides
that
neither
of
these
papers
will
engage
in
publication
of
any
other
newspaper
in
tucson.
on
the
next
page
in
rather
large
type
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
they
told
what
the
purpose
was
and
they
said,
"and
this
two
paper
--
the
arizona
star
did
in
large
letters
underlined
did
eliminate
all
competition
from
the
local
newspaper
field
on
that
day."
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
421
mr.
justice.
and
then
finally
i
would
like
to
invite
the
court's
attention
to
this
little
pictures
at
page
424
of
the
record
in
which
the
star
graphically
displays
what
the
result
of
this
agreement
was.
at
the
top
of
the
page,
we
have
two
hawks,
one
labeled
the
star
and
the
other
label
the
citizen.
at
the
edges
of
the
picture
we
have
two
draws,
one
labeled
circulation,
one
labeled
advertising.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
424
mr.
justice.
the
two
hawks
are
chained
together
at
the
rear
and
they
are
pooling.
each
one
is
pooling
one
to
its
circulation,
one
toward
advertising
but
of
course
neither
can
reach
the
trophy.
now
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
they
tell
us
what
happened
after
this
agreement.
we
now
have
the
two
troughs
again
circulation
and
advertising
and
both
the
star
and
the
citizen
shown
is
rather
fat
hawks
at
this
point
had
their
snouts
down
on
the
trough
enjoying
the
benefits
of
this.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now
this
was
in
response
to
a
provision
under
the
excess
profits
tax
that
they
could
get
relief
if
they
could
show
that
there
was
an
elimination
of
competition
resulting
from
a
merger
which
distorted
their
earnings
during
the
base
picture
but
they
have
told
us
--
they
have
told
us
as
plainly
as
they
can
what
the
purpose
was.
now
how
did
they
set
about
--
how
did
they
accomplish
this
elimination
of
competition?
they
did
it
basically
from
three
aspects
of
the
joint
operating
agreement
and
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
the
government
is
not
challenging
the
joint
operating
agreement
as
such.
it
is
only
challenging
this
three
aspects
and
the
district
court
has
not
struck
down
the
operating
agreement.
it
has
only
struck
out
these
three
paragraphs.
the
first
thing
they
did
was
they
turned
over
to
this
tucson
newspapers,
incorporated
which
they
jointly
control
the
sole
authority
to
fix
prices.
that
is
to
fix
the
advertising
rates,
to
fix
the
circulation
rates.
neither
of
them
after
this
agreement
could
fix
their
own
advertising
or
circulation
rates
independently.
now
i
would
like
to
suggest
to
the
court
a
hypothetical
situation
because
i
think
it
illustrates
the
basic
argument
they
are
making
here.
let
us
assume
we
had
two
newspapers
in
town
and
both
of
them
were
losing
money
and
the
publishers
of
the
papers
got
together
and
said,
things
are
terrible.
we're
both
losing
money.
the
best
solution
to
this
problem
is
for
both
of
us
substantially
to
increase
our
rates.
and
they
shook
hands
on
it
and
they
said,
"fine,
we'll
do
this
the
first
of
next
month."
and
then
they
decided
themselves
what
the
rate
level
would
be
and
they
said,
"well,
let's
turn
it
over
to
a
third
person
to
fix
the
rate."
it
seems
to
me
two
things
are
clear.
first,
that
they
could
not
possibly
offer
any
defense
to
this
as
a
per
se
violation,
it's
clearly
per
se
and
secondly,
they
could
not
attempt
to
justify
this
type
of
arrangement
on
the
plea
that
this
was
necessary
to
preserve
the
companies.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
regard
to
the
picture?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
mr.
justice.
there
was
no
objection
taken
to
the
introduction
of
this
document.
now
there
was
--
the
next
thing
that
they
did
which
they
said
was
essential
to
this
arrangement,
they
had
what
we
think
correctly
was
held
by
the
district
court
to
be
an
illegal
profit
pooling
arrangement
in
here.
the
proceeds
of
the
operations
of
the
papers,
what
they
did
was
the
tucson
newspapers,
inc.
received
all
the
revenues.
that
is
the
revenues
from
the
sales
of
advertising,
from
circulation
and
then
the
revenues
were
--
after
paying
the
expenses
of
putting
out
the
paper,
the
revenues
were
divided
between
the
two
papers
not
on
the
basis
of
what
each
one
contributed
but
according
to
a
fixed
formula.
that
is
without
regard
to
whether
one
contributed
more
or
one
contributed
less,
they
divided
it
up
according
to
a
preordained
formula.
you
mean,
contributed
in
the
sense
of
gross?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
of
gross
revenue,
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
yes.
i
mean,
subject
of
course
that
these
two
companies
obviously
had
basic
control.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
that
was
determined
by
tucson
newspapers,
inc.
because
they
took
over
--
it
took
over
for
these
two
papers
the
circulation
and
the
advertising.
the
business
affected
that
thing.
now,
this
seems
to
us
has
a
very
obvious
effect,
a
very
obvious
effect
of
deterring
the
incentive
of
each
paper
to
take
whatever
steps
might
increase
its
circulation
because
obviously
if
one
paper
decided
to
try
to
increase
its
circulation,
a
large
part
of
that
immediately
flows
over
to
the
other.
and
finally,
although
it's
not
terribly
important
in
this
case,
we're
not
stressing
that
the
third
agreement
provision
they
had
was
an
undertaking
that
neither
of
them
would
go
into
any
publishing
basis
in
tucson.
now,
the
question
as
we
see
the
case
is
whether
this
three
restraints
which
--
it
seems
to
us
are
the
type
of
this
court
traditionally
has
treated
as
per
se
and
the
purpose
of
which
as
the
court
found
and
the
effect
of
which
was
to
eliminate
all
commercial
competition
between
the
two
papers
can
be
save
as
somehow
is
taken
out
of
the
operation
of
these
rules
because
of
the
claim
that
this
was
necessary
to
say
a
failing
newspaper
in
1940.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
i'd
like
--
i'd
like
to
make
two
points
in
answer
mr.
justice.
first
of
all,
it
seems
to
us
and
i
think
your
honor
has
put
the
case
it
seems
--
i
think
fairly,
it
seems
to
us
what
they're
really
suggesting
in
this
case
is
that
the
normal
antitrust
principles
that
apply
to
all
industries
should
somehow
be
treated
somewhat
differently
because
of
the
peculiar
characteristics
of
the
newspaper
business.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
as
--
i'd
like
to
just
make
two
answers
to
that.
first,
there
is
a
disagreement
as
we
have
developed
in
our
brief
among
authorities
as
to
the
causes
of
the
problems
of
the
newspaper
industry.
admittedly
there's
been
a
tremendous
failure.
on
the
other
hand,
there
are
people
who
believe
that
perhaps
with
new
technology
things
may
improve.
but
my
other
answer
is
it
seems
to
me
if
there
is
to
be
a
special
treatment
of
the
newspaper
industry,
we
think
this
is
basically
a
problem
for
the
congress
and
not
for
the
judicial
branch
of
the
government.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
a
judicial
development
mr.
justice
but
i
don't
think
a
judicial
development
of
providing
special
rules
for
particular
industries.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
baseball
was
an
application
--
originally
the
baseball
decision
was
not
--
a
special
rule
for
baseball
but
--
that
as
the
court
then
viewed
interstate
commerce
based
those
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
but
on
the
application
of
stare
decisis,
they're
not
reaching
the
merits
of
whether
baseball
was
quoted
but
on
the
theory
that
that
was
not
appropriate
in
the
circumstances
to
be
exempt.
i
just
like
to
stress
here
that
the
pleas
often
made
to
the
court
of
course
that
rules
of
law
should
not
be
changed
by
the
court
but
should
be
changed
by
congress.
but
this
--
in
this
case,
congress
for
two
years
has
had
this
very
problem
before
it.
they
have
been
pending
now
in
the
congress
for
two
years,
various
bills
that
would
specifically
sanction
this
type
of
agreement
for
the
newspaper.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
no,
that's
about
the
next
point
after
i
answer
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
and
i'd
like
to
--
if
i
may
turn
to
that
right
now.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
was
two
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
--
we
say,
it's
not
a
merger
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
its
still
--
there
was
still
two
editorial
voices.
there
was
still
two
--
there
were
two,
the
two
papers
that
the
court
found
continued
to
operate
as
separate
editorial
voices,
we
don't
question
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
they
--
continued
to
be
separately
owned.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
separately
owned
but
they
did
have
this
interrelationship
between
them
on
the
business
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
no.
mr.
justice,
we
do
suggest,
we
do
suggest
that
we
have
in
our
brief
that
the
likely
tendency
of
this
type
of
commercial
operation
may
be
to
inhibit
competition
in
news.
if
we
don't
say
that
it
has
here,
but
the
tendency
of
it
--
in
other
words,
people
would
have
this
interrelationship
on
the
business
level
and
who
have
had
removed
some
of
the
incentives
for
trying
to
increase
their
business,
its
likely
to
have
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
know
what
they'd
do.
i
suppose
they
would
attempt
to
try
to
persuade
that
paper
to
improve
itself
i
would
think.
i'd
like
to
come
now
to
this
whole
question
of
the
failing
company
because
that
of
course
is
the
foundation
on
which
their
entire
argument
rests.
they
claim
in
1940
the
star
--
citizen
was
a
failing
company
and
of
course
if
that
under
pending
falls
it
seems
to
us,
do
does
their
whole
case.
now
the
district
court
found
and
this
is
at
page
72,
that's
the
second
sentence,
it
says
that
at
the
time
they
entered
into
the
operating
agreement,
citizen
publishing
was
not
then
on
the
verge
of
going
out
of
business
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
page
72
of
the
appendix,
finding
17,
the
second
sentence.
it
said
at
the
time,
citizen
publishing
was
not
then
on
the
verge
of
going
out
of
business
nor
was
there
a
serious
probability
at
that
time
that
citizen
publishing
would
terminate
its
business
to
liquidate
its
assets
unless
star
publishing
and
citizen
publishing
entered
into
the
operating
agreement.
we
think
the
record
fully
supports
that
finding.
we
also
think
that
finding
does
properly
embody
a
so-called
failing
company
defense
in
the
international
shoe
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
we
do
mr.
justice
and
i'd
like
to
refer
to
809
specific
items
which
we
think
support
it.
but
before
that
i
just
like
to
say
one
thing
because
they
have
challenges
in
the
brief.
the
evidence
to
which
i
am
going
to
refer
was
not
admitted
of
course
on
the
motion
for
the
summary
judgment.
at
the
time
of
the
summary
judgment,
it
was
decided
on
affidavit.
this
evidence
came
in,
in
the
course
of
the
trial
on
the
section
2
issues,
it
was
offered
with
respect
to
intent.
however,
it
seems
to
us
that
all
the
evidence
that
is
relevant
to
the
failing
company
defense
was
introduced.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
there
was
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
yes,
this
was
after
the
record
was
closed.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
was
in
the
record
and
it
was
before
the
court.
it
was
before
the
court
of
course
when
the
court
made
this
finding
17.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh
yes,
they
object.
they
do
object
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
yes,
they
objected
all
the
way
to
our
motion
for
summary
judgment.
they
objected
to
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
did
--
in
some
cases
we
have
where
we
think
there
are
disputed
factual
issues.
on
the
other
hand,
in
situations
where
we
think
that
on
the
undisputed
facts,
we're
entitled
to
judgment,
we
have
supported
summary
judgment
and
your
honor
in
his
opinion
in
the
northern
pacific
case
upheld
the
grant
of
summary
judgment.
they
are
on
a
tying
agreement.
there
have
been
a
number
of
cases
of
course
in
which
summary
judgment
has
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
view
of
all
the
other
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
are
only
two
items
of
evidence
that
they
claim
they
should
have
had
the
right
to
introduce
on
the
question
of
failing
company
that
was
not
introduced.
we
think
neither
of
those
is
relevant.
first
to
some
statistics
as
to
the
financial
condition
of
the
citizen
on
the
1920s
that
seem
to
us
is
too
remote.
secondly,
as
some
statements
by
various
people
in
the
tucson
area
which
is
printed
in
the
record
as
to
the
importance
of
having
two
papers
in
tucson,
again
it
seems
to
us
that's
irrelevant.
now
let
me
come
to
the
specific
issues.
i'd
like
to
start
with
something
because
the
argument
is
put
in
terms
of
failing
company.
is
it
--
was
it
a
failing
company
and
they
say
basically
mr.
maclaury
says,
just
look
at
the
balance
sheet,
that's
enough.
now,
failing
company
is
really
a
shorthand
phrase
we
think.
failing
company
is
a
shorthand
phrase
with
a
basic
concept
that
when
a
company
is
in
such
serious
condition
and
has
such
serious
problems
that
it
appears
that
it
is
about
to
go
out
of
the
market
anyhow,
then
its
acquisition
via
competitor
is
not
substantially
less
in
competition
because
it
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
and
we
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
i
think
mr.
justice,
i
think,
i
suggest
that
if
this
management
is
willing
to
keep
it
going,
it
is
at
that
time
a
viable
entity
in
terms
of
the
purpose
of
the
failing
company
defense.
that
is
if
the
entity
--
he
is
able
to
keep
going,
if
the
entity
is
able
to
keep
going,
if
the
man
is
willing
to
keep
it
going
for
a
while,
it
seems
to
me
that
refutes
the
claim
that
its
elimination
through
a
merger
will
not
substantially
lessen
competition.
now
let
me
come
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
surely.
yes
of
course.
let
me
come
to
these
items
of
evidence
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
though
we
--
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
there
are
many
of
these
situations
--
a
publisher
may
have
hopes
of
rehabilitating
the
paper
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
hope.
i
would
think
so
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right
because
it's
continuing
as
an
operating
entity
in
the
market.
now,
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
just
come
to
these
items
of
evidence
that
we
have
here.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
--
he
did
for
many
years.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
first
of
all,
the
initial
overtures
about
making
this
arrangement
came
not
from
the
citizen
which
allegedly
was
the
failing
company
but
from
the
other
paper,
from
the
star.
now
this
is
directly
in
contrast
with
the
international
shoe
case
where
the
overtures
came
from
the
failing
company.
it
seems
to
us,
this
is
of
some
significance
cause
normally
if
a
company
feels
that
it
can't
go
on
it
would
take
the
initiative.
now
in
the
international
shoe
case,
this
court
found
that
the
controlling
purpose
of
international
in
acquiring
the
mcelwain
company,
the
failing
company
there
was
to
get
additional
plans
for
its
business
which
it
could
not
have
been
quickly
hope
to
make.
and
in
its
discussion
of
what
it
was
holding
as
to
that,
the
acquisition
of
the
company
in
those
circumstances
would
not
violate
section
7.
it
put
in
as
a
qualification.
the
--
in
the
passage
which
the
appellants
themselves
quote
in
their
brief
at
page
41
that
the
purchase
of
the
competitor
there
was
not
and
i
?not
with
a
purpose
to
lessen
competition.?
and
that
of
course
is
exactly
the
opposite
of
the
purpose
the
district
court
found
was
involved
here.
now,
initially
in
1936,
a
small
purchase,
only
a
25%
interest
in
the
paper,
over
the
next
three
years,
he
increased
his
share
of
the
paper
from
25
to
75%.
it's
been
suggested
that
he
made
attempts
to
finance
the
paper
and
they
were
unsuccessful
in
this
interval.
the
record
shows
at
pages
205
to
206
that
these
attempts,
he
merely
spoke
to
three
people
he
knew,
a
retired
man,
a
man
who
just
moved
to
arizona
and
asked
him,
wouldn't
he
perhaps
like
to
put
some
money
into
the
paper
and
they
refused.
when
those
three
people
refused
to
do
so,
mr.
small
decided
to
move
to
tucson
from
chicago
and
what
he
said
--
what
the
district
court
found
when
he
testified
was,
he
said
--
he
decided
to
come
out
himself
at
page
206
of
the
record,
he
said,
"i
felt
that
i
could
carry
the
deficit
from
some
little
time."
there's
nothing
to
indicate
at,
that
when
this
operating
agreement
was
entered
into
that
mr.
small
had
any
intention
of
liquidating
the
citizen.
that
there's
no
indication
he
tried
any
steps
to
improve
its
financial
condition
and
there's
nothing
to
show
he
made
any
efforts
to
try
to
sell
it
to
others.
now
as
to
the
financial
condition
of
the
paper,
it
is
true,
the
citizen
for
a
number
of
years
had
been
losing
money.
however,
between
1938
and
1939
just
before
the
time
that
mr.
small
came
out
or
during
this
period,
the
paper's
condition
improved.
its
circulation
in
those
--
between
those
two
years
went
up
22%.
its
deficit
was
reduced.its
advertising
had
gone
up
and
its
operating
revenues
had
gone
up.
now
the
appellants
tried
us
and
say
we've
made
an
unfair
comparison
because
they
say
1938
was
the
worst
year
of
the
citizen
and
we
shouldn't
compare
it
with
1939.
but
of
course
it
seems
not
unlikely
perhaps
that
this
was
the
turning
in
the
citizen
of
course
and
this
was
the
situation.
this
was
the
situation
that
the
citizen
was
faced
with
when
it
decided
to
enter
into
this
operating
agreement.
it
saw
--
this
was
--
it
was
at
this
point
that
mr.
small
when
these
improvements
seem
to
be
developing
that
he
decided
to
come
out
to
tucson
to
play
a
more
active
role
in
the
paper
and
he
said
to
carry
it
along
for
a
little
while.
and
finally
--
oh,
one
other
thing,
i
might
mention,
that
on
the
--
there
have
been
a
reference
to
the
balance
sheet,
that
a
substantial
portion
of
these
liabilities
as
mr.
maclaury
has
indicated
belongs
to
stockholders
and
finally,
as
to
the
present
condition,
as
to
the
present,
the
claim
is
a
pro
forma
earning
statement
in
which
we
point
out
what
we
think
there's
some
deficiencies
on
it.
but
it
seems
to
us,
the
answer
to
all
of
this
argument
that
the
citizen
was
equally
certain
to
fail
again
if
it
was
now
required
to
terminate
this
profit
pooling,
price
fixing
and
division
of
market,
provisions
of
the
agreement
is
the
district
court's
three
findings
at
page
98
to
99,
findings
number
190
to
192
which
says
that
the
joint
trading
and
distribution
of
the
star
does
not
depend
upon
these
provisions
that
the
restoration
of
competition
requires
that
they
have
separate
advertising
and
circulation
requirements.
and
finally,
finding
192,
the
court
says,
"it
is
impossible
to
predict
with
any
substantial
degree
of
completeness
what
the
operating
results
of
either
newspaper
will
be
in
a
competitive
situation."
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon
me.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
yes,
we
think
it's
impossible
to
predict.
that
is
it
cannot
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
think
it's
impossible
to
predict
how
well
they
will
do.
in
other
words,
you
cannot
say
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
so.
i
think
so,
but
the
district
court
certainly
said
that
he
could
not
make
the
prediction
that
if
these
provisions
were
cancelled
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
we
don't
agree
with
that
mr.
justice.
and
therefore
it
seems
to
us
that
this
find
--
this
evidence
to
which
i
referred,
i
will
point
one
other
thing.
it's
rather
interesting
that
although
the
citizen
allegedly
was
failing
in
1940
and
presumably
under
their
theory
of
quickly
going
out
of
business,
the
star
was
willing
to
give
the
citizen
a
very
substantial
share
of
the
joint
operating
revenue.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
about
three-and-a-half
times
as
much.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
each
of
them.
they
had
roughly
the
same
circulation
in
1965
about
40,000
each.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
know
that.
as
i
say
that
the
--
although
the
publisher
testified,
although
publisher
testified
that
the
reason
he
was
so
generous
is
he
wanted
to
preserve
two
operating
voices
in
tucson.
it
seems
one
can
legitimately
ask
whether
perhaps
he
wasn't
also
anxious
to
avoid
the
possibility
that
this
new
man
coming
in
might
create
a
very
serious
competitor
for
him
or
might
perhaps
sell
the
paper
to
someone
else
who
would
be
in
a
position
to
be
a
more
vigorous
competitor.
so
that
what
you
have
here
is
that
the
--
these
two
people
got
together
and
attempted
to
solve
the
financial
problems
with
the
paper
by
eliminating
all
competition
between
them.
and
we
think
that
the
district
court
was
fully
justified
in
his
--
in
its
finding
that
in
1940
citizen
was
not
on
the
verge
of
going
business
and
it
was
not
a
serious
probability
at
that
time
that
citizen
would
liquid
--
be
liquidate
and
dissolve
unless
it
entered
into
this
agreement.
now,
i
would
just
very
briefly,
we
developed
it
in
our
brief,
in
my
remaining
time,
just
say
something
on
the
claim
that
if
the
court
disagrees
with
us
and
thinks
that
this
finding
is
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
well
that
ties
us
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
finding
that
they
were
not
a
failing
company,
in
other
words,
if
the
court
would
think
that
the
district
court
was
clearly
erroneous
and
we
think
he
was
correct.
but
if
the
court
should
disagree
with
us,
i'd
like
just
briefly
to
indicate,
to
sketch
to
the
court
the
reasons
we
think
the
district
court
still
properly
condemned
these
restraints
as
per
se
illegal.
the
attempt
was
to
analogize
this
to
a
partial
merger.
now,
of
course,
as
i've
indicated,
we
are
not
challenging
the
operating
agreement
but
only
parts
of
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
a
merger
basically
is
a
single
transaction
which
has
some
obvious
anticompetitive
effects,
that
is
if
competitors
combine
and
eliminates
the
competition
between
them.
on
the
other
hand,
it
may
have
some
benefits.
it
may
lead
to
an
improvement
of
the
structure
of
the
operating
assets.
it
may
need
to
--
lead
to
some
useful
economies.
so
that
it's
impossible
on
a
merger
to
separate
out
the
anticompetitive
and
the
precompetitive
things.
so,
we
have
to
do
is
make
an
over
all
judgment
as
to
whether
or
not
the
total
effect
of
the
merger
maybe
substantially
to
lessen
competition.
but
this
is
a
very
different
kind
of
a
thing.
this
is
a
very
different
kind
of
beast.
here
what
we
have
is
this
agreement
with
separable
provisions.
some
of
it,
you
could
just
put
your
fingers
on
this
provisions
and
see
the
provision
for
price
fixing
obviously
eliminates
competition.
the
provision
for
profit
pooling
obviously
eliminates
competition.
the
provision
that
they
will
not
engage
in
any
other
publishing
business
obviously
eliminates
competition.
we
think
those
can
be
tested
under
the
traditional
per
se
rules
and
found
illegal.
conversely,
the
provisions
for
joint
printing,
for
joint
distribution,
these
are
things
which
can
also
be
tested
and
these
are
plainly
not
illegal.
they
do
not
restrain
competition
and
therefore
for
that
reason
the
government
has
not
challenged
and
it
seems
to
us
that
once
again
if
i
may
come
back
to
what
i
said
earlier,
that
basically
this
is
a
plea
by
the
appellants
for
special
rules
for
the
newspaper
business.
i
think
if
you
have
this
kind
of
situation
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
there
--
they
still
are
i
think
mr.
justice
because
they
urge
this
as
a
merger.
and
it
seems
to
me
even
assuming
if
this
were
failing,
we
suggest
this
is
not
like
a
merger
that
this
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
that
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
that's
where
we
part
company
with
them
mr.
justice.
and
we
part
company
with
them
because
we
think
that
in
the
merger
field,
in
the
merger
field,
you
have
to
look
at
the
merger
as
a
whole
body.
you
have
to
look
at
it
as
a
whole
body
whereas
this
type
of
thing
we
do
not
think
can
be
analogized
to
a
merger
because
we
think
here
you
can
separate
out
the
good
and
the
bad
and
that
there
are
very
different
considerations
that
are
applicable
here.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
except
mr.
justice,
the
two
are
very
interrelated.
the
two
are
very
interrelated
in
that
sense
that
it
is
not
it
seems
to
us
the
same
thing
as
though
you
have
the
two
of
them
combining
into
one
business.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
you
have
immediately
more
but
there
are
--
there
are
countervailing
considerations
which
we
suggest
perhaps
the
effect
of
a
combination
leaves
the
market
open
for
someone
else
to
come
in.
here,
what
you
have
is
these
two
papers
are
kept
going
with
this
agreement
which
restrains
competition.
this
in
effect
has
pretty
--
completely
occupy
the
market
and
it's
occupied
the
market
by
means
of
this
elimination
of
competition.
it
just
seems
to
us,
if
the
problems
of
the
newspapers
is
such
that
there
should
be
relief
in
this
situation,
we
think
this
is
this
bill
which
is
before
congress.
we
have
opposed
the
bill
but
we
think
that
that
is
the
appropriate
for
redress
in
this
situation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
where
they
do
their
business.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
its
--
in
a
sense,
it
is
mr.
justice,
that's
where
they
make
or
lose
their
money
but
of
course
--
but
of
course,
how
well
they're
going
to
do
on
circulation?
how
well
they're
going
to
do
on
advertising
depend
on
circulation?
how
well
they're
going
to
do
on
circulation
depend
upon
how
good
their
paper
is.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
what
he
has
done
mr.
justice
is
this,
they
have
not
here
--
they
have
not
appealed
from
the
finding
that
the
merger
of
the
two
papers,
they
actually
merged
in
1965.
he
--
they
have
not
appealed
from
that
and
they
agreed
that
divestiture
is
appropriate.
now
what
the
court
did
in
addition
to
ordering
divestiture
of
the
two
papers,
the
court
went
on
and
said
that
in
such
divestiture,
they
had
to
modify
the
operating
agreement
to
eliminate
these
three
provisions
which
resulted
in
the
joint
business
act.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
that's
right.
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
was
a
finding
on
section
7
at
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
section
7
issue
mr.
justice
white
its
related
only
to
the
year
1965.
it
was
an
acquisition
by
citizen
of
star
stock
in
1965.
we
make
--
we
do
not
contest
that
ruling.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
sect
--
yes,
but
it
was
not
challenged
under
section
7.
it
was
challenged
only
under
section
1.
the
1940
transaction
was
challenged
only
under
section
1.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
they
had
challenged
it
under
section
7,
yes
but
actually
the
burden
on
the
government
in
bringing
this
case
under
section
1
was
far
greater
it
would've
been
had
they
challenged
it
under
section
7.
they
did
not
challenge
the
1940
operating
agreement
under
section
7.
so,
at
the
close
of
trial,
after
we'd
had
a
great
deal
of
testimony
on
the
question
whether
there
was
a
violation
of
section
2
and
the
primary
issue
there
was
(1)
intent
to
acquire
power
over
the
market
and
(2)
relief.
we
put
in
a
great
deal
of
testimony
including
the
testimony
and
evidence
concerning
the
failing
condition
of
citizen
so
as
to
show
that
these
people
really
had
no
intent
to
monopolize
but
their
intent
was
to
rehabilitate
these
two
newspapers.
now,
section
1
was
not
in
the
case
at
that
time.
it
had
been
eliminated
by
summary
judgment
and
at
the
close
of
trial,
we
moved
not
quite
in
terms
of
--
stated
by
the
solicitor
general.
what
our
motion
was
that
the
court
reopened
the
trial
and
permit
the
--
set
aside
its
summary
judgment
on
section
1
and
permit
the
government
to
adduce
evidence
on
that
issue
and
permit
us
to
rebut
that
evidence
and
also
to
apply
to
that
issue
all
of
the
evidence
that
we
had
adduced
under
section
2.
now
the
court
denied
that
motion
and
refused
to
set
aside
its
ruling
on
summary
judgment
that
section
1
was
a
violation.
so
its
not
--
i
don't
think
a
proper
statement
of
the
record
to
say
that
the
court
considered
in
a
section
1
context
all
of
the
evidence
on
the
failing
company
doctrine.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
do
not
your
honor.
i
find
--
i
think
this
that
in
1965,
the
court
needed
only
to
find
that
if
the
operating
agreement
should
abrogated
then
one
company
would
fail.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
your
honor,
the
section
7
violation,
i
haven't
argued
here
at
all.
the
section
7
violation
which
was
charged
was
an
acquisition
by
citizen
of
the
stock
of
star
in
1965.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
we
make
--
we
do
not
contest
that
finding.
we
do
not
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
neither
company
was
failing
at
that
time.
we
do
not
contest
that
rule.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
the
companies
at
the
journalistic
level
and
we
have
asked
this
court
to
reverse
the
section
1
issue
and
for
with
us
to
sell,
permit
citizen
to
sell
star
promptly
as
we
had
always
advised
the
government
in
the
fist
place,
that's
what
we
intended
to
do
when
we
acquired
it.
we
have
--
the
citizen
has
no
intent
and
no
desire
to
retain
star.
it
was
their
intent
at
the
time
they
required
it
to
promptly
dispose
of
it.
so
we
raised
no
issue
there.
the
only
issue
we
raised
on
the
1965
transaction
is
that
if
this
court
should
sustain
the
district
court's
ruling
on
abrogating
the
main
clauses
of
the
operating
agreement
so
that
citizen
then
would
be
likely
to
go
into
a
failing
condition
that
citizen
on
this
be
given
the
option
of
disposing
of
either
star
or
citizen
because
the
whole
game
has
been
changed.
and
that's
the
same
option
that
the
government
recently
gave
in
a
consent
decree
to
the
gannett
newspapers
in
rockford,
illinois
where
the
gannett
newspapers
acquired
a
radio
and
in
consenting
to
dispose
of
one
or
the
other,
the
government
agreed
that
the
newspaper
could
at
their
choice,
dispose
of
either
the
radio
station
or
the
newspaper.
and
i
just
like
to
close
again
to
--
and
then
close
into
the
state
that
i'm
satisfied
and
on
examination
the
court
will
be
satisfied
that
the
cause
of
the
conflict
between
the
findings
of
fact
in
number
14,
finding
14
and
15
of
the
financial
condition
of
citizen
that
it
could
not
have
met
that
by
finding
17,
by
conclusion
in
finding
17
that
citizen
in
1940
was
not
a
failing
company.
all
it
intended
to
do
was
to
say
that
mr.
small
was
willing
and
continue
at
that
time
to
reach
down
deeper
in
his
pocket
to
finance
--
continue
to
finance
that
failing
company.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
your
honor.
about
one
year,
almost
one
year
after
the
case
was
tried,
9
months
after
and
i
might
add
to
that
finding
17
was
not
proposed
by
the
government,
it
was
not
proposed
by
the
defendants,
it
was
a
finding
arrived
at
by
the
court
on
which
it
heard
no
argument.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
just
the
section
2
issue
and
the
section
7
issue.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
because
the
district
court's
order
orders
the
owner
of
citizen
to
dispose
of
star
and
does
not
give
them
that
choice
that
they
must
dispose
of
star.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
found
in
this
case
in
finding
number
20,
page
74
of
the
record
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
parties
to
the
operating
agreement
to
reduce
costs
and
increase
profits
by
eliminating
commercial
competition
between
star
and
the
citizen
while
retaining
separate
editorial
and
news
departments.
in
their
agreement
to
reduce
costs
and
in
four
on
the
same
page
they
speak
of
what
they
did
in
furtherance
of
their
intent
to
eliminate
competition
between
the
two
papers.
moreover,
both
of
the
parties
conceded
at
the
trial
that
this
was
the
purpose
of
the
operating
agreement.
mr.
matthews
who
was
the
owner
of
the
star
stated
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
agreement
to
end
commercial
competition
between
star
and
citizen.
this
is
at
page
194
of
the
record.
mr.
small
sr.
would
then
who
was
the
owner
of
the
citizen
said
the
same
thing.
a
mr.
chambers
who
had
been
the
business
and
edit
and
advertising
manager
of
the
star
in
1940
and
who
had
participated
in
the
negotiations
leading
to
the
joint
operating
agreement,
he
stated
at
page
155
of
the
record
when
he
was
asked
as
the
--
whether
as
the
result
of
this
tucson
newspapers,
inc.
was
there
any
competition
remaining
between
the
star
with
respect
to
the
business
aspect,
he
said,
"we
tried
to
make
it
not
so.
i
don't
think
that
there
was."
and
then
he
later
--
a
few
pages
later
at
page
158
of
the
record
he
was
asked
whether
this
arrangement
could've
worked
if
the
revenues
had
been
divided
on
some
method
other
than
a
fixed
formula
which
i
will
come
to
in
a
minute
and
he
said,
"no."
he
didn't
think
it
would.
he
said
that
that
was
--
would've
defeated
all
the
idea
we
had
for
accomplishing
this
unification.
we
were
trying,
he
said,
"i
guess
that
competition
is
a
nasty
word
in
this
court
but
we
were
trying
to
eliminate
the
competition
between
the
two
of
us."
that's
all.
now,
in
addition
to
this
testimony
at
the
trial
we
had
in
this
record
a
rather
unusual
document
which
is
government
exhibit
number
26
which
was
a
submission
that
the
star
made
in
1947
to
the
internal
revenue
service
in
support
of
excess
profits
tax
relief
for
the
more
years.
and
i
have
to
read
to
the
court
a
couple
of
the
things
that
the
star
said
in
this
document
about
the
purpose
of
the
1940
agreement.
in
page
409
they
said,
it
is
obvious
that
the
aim
and
purpose
of
the
parties
was
to
destroy
every
vestige
of
the
competition
that
existed
on
january
1,
1940.
then
at
pages
420
and
421
they
say
in
order
to
preserve
perpetual
elimination
of
competition
the
operate
agreements
provides
that
neither
of
these
papers
will
engage
in
publication
of
any
other
newspaper
in
tucson.
on
the
next
page
in
rather
large
type
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
they
told
what
the
purpose
was
and
they
said,
"and
this
two
paper
--
the
arizona
star
did
in
large
letters
underlined
did
eliminate
all
competition
from
the
local
newspaper
field
on
that
day."
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
421
mr.
justice.
and
then
finally
i
would
like
to
invite
the
court's
attention
to
this
little
pictures
at
page
424
of
the
record
in
which
the
star
graphically
displays
what
the
result
of
this
agreement
was.
at
the
top
of
the
page,
we
have
two
hawks,
one
labeled
the
star
and
the
other
label
the
citizen.
at
the
edges
of
the
picture
we
have
two
draws,
one
labeled
circulation,
one
labeled
advertising.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
424
mr.
justice.
the
two
hawks
are
chained
together
at
the
rear
and
they
are
pooling.
each
one
is
pooling
one
to
its
circulation,
one
toward
advertising
but
of
course
neither
can
reach
the
trophy.
now
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
they
tell
us
what
happened
after
this
agreement.
we
now
have
the
two
troughs
again
circulation
and
advertising
and
both
the
star
and
the
citizen
shown
is
rather
fat
hawks
at
this
point
had
their
snouts
down
on
the
trough
enjoying
the
benefits
of
this.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now
this
was
in
response
to
a
provision
under
the
excess
profits
tax
that
they
could
get
relief
if
they
could
show
that
there
was
an
elimination
of
competition
resulting
from
a
merger
which
distorted
their
earnings
during
the
base
picture
but
they
have
told
us
--
they
have
told
us
as
plainly
as
they
can
what
the
purpose
was.
now
how
did
they
set
about
--
how
did
they
accomplish
this
elimination
of
competition?
they
did
it
basically
from
three
aspects
of
the
joint
operating
agreement
and
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
the
government
is
not
challenging
the
joint
operating
agreement
as
such.
it
is
only
challenging
this
three
aspects
and
the
district
court
has
not
struck
down
the
operating
agreement.
it
has
only
struck
out
these
three
paragraphs.
the
first
thing
they
did
was
they
turned
over
to
this
tucson
newspapers,
incorporated
which
they
jointly
control
the
sole
authority
to
fix
prices.
that
is
to
fix
the
advertising
rates,
to
fix
the
circulation
rates.
neither
of
them
after
this
agreement
could
fix
their
own
advertising
or
circulation
rates
independently.
now
i
would
like
to
suggest
to
the
court
a
hypothetical
situation
because
i
think
it
illustrates
the
basic
argument
they
are
making
here.
let
us
assume
we
had
two
newspapers
in
town
and
both
of
them
were
losing
money
and
the
publishers
of
the
papers
got
together
and
said,
things
are
terrible.
we're
both
losing
money.
the
best
solution
to
this
problem
is
for
both
of
us
substantially
to
increase
our
rates.
and
they
shook
hands
on
it
and
they
said,
"fine,
we'll
do
this
the
first
of
next
month."
and
then
they
decided
themselves
what
the
rate
level
would
be
and
they
said,
"well,
let's
turn
it
over
to
a
third
person
to
fix
the
rate."
it
seems
to
me
two
things
are
clear.
first,
that
they
could
not
possibly
offer
any
defense
to
this
as
a
per
se
violation,
it's
clearly
per
se
and
secondly,
they
could
not
attempt
to
justify
this
type
of
arrangement
on
the
plea
that
this
was
necessary
to
preserve
the
companies.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
regard
to
the
picture?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
mr.
justice.
there
was
no
objection
taken
to
the
introduction
of
this
document.
now
there
was
--
the
next
thing
that
they
did
which
they
said
was
essential
to
this
arrangement,
they
had
what
we
think
correctly
was
held
by
the
district
court
to
be
an
illegal
profit
pooling
arrangement
in
here.
the
proceeds
of
the
operations
of
the
papers,
what
they
did
was
the
tucson
newspapers,
inc.
received
all
the
revenues.
that
is
the
revenues
from
the
sales
of
advertising,
from
circulation
and
then
the
revenues
were
--
after
paying
the
expenses
of
putting
out
the
paper,
the
revenues
were
divided
between
the
two
papers
not
on
the
basis
of
what
each
one
contributed
but
according
to
a
fixed
formula.
that
is
without
regard
to
whether
one
contributed
more
or
one
contributed
less,
they
divided
it
up
according
to
a
preordained
formula.
you
mean,
contributed
in
the
sense
of
gross?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
of
gross
revenue,
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
yes.
i
mean,
subject
of
course
that
these
two
companies
obviously
had
basic
control.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
that
was
determined
by
tucson
newspapers,
inc.
because
they
took
over
--
it
took
over
for
these
two
papers
the
circulation
and
the
advertising.
the
business
affected
that
thing.
now,
this
seems
to
us
has
a
very
obvious
effect,
a
very
obvious
effect
of
deterring
the
incentive
of
each
paper
to
take
whatever
steps
might
increase
its
circulation
because
obviously
if
one
paper
decided
to
try
to
increase
its
circulation,
a
large
part
of
that
immediately
flows
over
to
the
other.
and
finally,
although
it's
not
terribly
important
in
this
case,
we're
not
stressing
that
the
third
agreement
provision
they
had
was
an
undertaking
that
neither
of
them
would
go
into
any
publishing
basis
in
tucson.
now,
the
question
as
we
see
the
case
is
whether
this
three
restraints
which
--
it
seems
to
us
are
the
type
of
this
court
traditionally
has
treated
as
per
se
and
the
purpose
of
which
as
the
court
found
and
the
effect
of
which
was
to
eliminate
all
commercial
competition
between
the
two
papers
can
be
save
as
somehow
is
taken
out
of
the
operation
of
these
rules
because
of
the
claim
that
this
was
necessary
to
say
a
failing
newspaper
in
1940.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
i'd
like
--
i'd
like
to
make
two
points
in
answer
mr.
justice.
first
of
all,
it
seems
to
us
and
i
think
your
honor
has
put
the
case
it
seems
--
i
think
fairly,
it
seems
to
us
what
they're
really
suggesting
in
this
case
is
that
the
normal
antitrust
principles
that
apply
to
all
industries
should
somehow
be
treated
somewhat
differently
because
of
the
peculiar
characteristics
of
the
newspaper
business.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
as
--
i'd
like
to
just
make
two
answers
to
that.
first,
there
is
a
disagreement
as
we
have
developed
in
our
brief
among
authorities
as
to
the
causes
of
the
problems
of
the
newspaper
industry.
admittedly
there's
been
a
tremendous
failure.
on
the
other
hand,
there
are
people
who
believe
that
perhaps
with
new
technology
things
may
improve.
but
my
other
answer
is
it
seems
to
me
if
there
is
to
be
a
special
treatment
of
the
newspaper
industry,
we
think
this
is
basically
a
problem
for
the
congress
and
not
for
the
judicial
branch
of
the
government.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
a
judicial
development
mr.
justice
but
i
don't
think
a
judicial
development
of
providing
special
rules
for
particular
industries.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
baseball
was
an
application
--
originally
the
baseball
decision
was
not
--
a
special
rule
for
baseball
but
--
that
as
the
court
then
viewed
interstate
commerce
based
those
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
but
on
the
application
of
stare
decisis,
they're
not
reaching
the
merits
of
whether
baseball
was
quoted
but
on
the
theory
that
that
was
not
appropriate
in
the
circumstances
to
be
exempt.
i
just
like
to
stress
here
that
the
pleas
often
made
to
the
court
of
course
that
rules
of
law
should
not
be
changed
by
the
court
but
should
be
changed
by
congress.
but
this
--
in
this
case,
congress
for
two
years
has
had
this
very
problem
before
it.
they
have
been
pending
now
in
the
congress
for
two
years,
various
bills
that
would
specifically
sanction
this
type
of
agreement
for
the
newspaper.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
no,
that's
about
the
next
point
after
i
answer
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
and
i'd
like
to
--
if
i
may
turn
to
that
right
now.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
was
two
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
--
we
say,
it's
not
a
merger
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
its
still
--
there
was
still
two
editorial
voices.
there
was
still
two
--
there
were
two,
the
two
papers
that
the
court
found
continued
to
operate
as
separate
editorial
voices,
we
don't
question
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
they
--
continued
to
be
separately
owned.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
separately
owned
but
they
did
have
this
interrelationship
between
them
on
the
business
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
no.
mr.
justice,
we
do
suggest,
we
do
suggest
that
we
have
in
our
brief
that
the
likely
tendency
of
this
type
of
commercial
operation
may
be
to
inhibit
competition
in
news.
if
we
don't
say
that
it
has
here,
but
the
tendency
of
it
--
in
other
words,
people
would
have
this
interrelationship
on
the
business
level
and
who
have
had
removed
some
of
the
incentives
for
trying
to
increase
their
business,
its
likely
to
have
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
know
what
they'd
do.
i
suppose
they
would
attempt
to
try
to
persuade
that
paper
to
improve
itself
i
would
think.
i'd
like
to
come
now
to
this
whole
question
of
the
failing
company
because
that
of
course
is
the
foundation
on
which
their
entire
argument
rests.
they
claim
in
1940
the
star
--
citizen
was
a
failing
company
and
of
course
if
that
under
pending
falls
it
seems
to
us,
do
does
their
whole
case.
now
the
district
court
found
and
this
is
at
page
72,
that's
the
second
sentence,
it
says
that
at
the
time
they
entered
into
the
operating
agreement,
citizen
publishing
was
not
then
on
the
verge
of
going
out
of
business
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
page
72
of
the
appendix,
finding
17,
the
second
sentence.
it
said
at
the
time,
citizen
publishing
was
not
then
on
the
verge
of
going
out
of
business
nor
was
there
a
serious
probability
at
that
time
that
citizen
publishing
would
terminate
its
business
to
liquidate
its
assets
unless
star
publishing
and
citizen
publishing
entered
into
the
operating
agreement.
we
think
the
record
fully
supports
that
finding.
we
also
think
that
finding
does
properly
embody
a
so-called
failing
company
defense
in
the
international
shoe
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
we
do
mr.
justice
and
i'd
like
to
refer
to
809
specific
items
which
we
think
support
it.
but
before
that
i
just
like
to
say
one
thing
because
they
have
challenges
in
the
brief.
the
evidence
to
which
i
am
going
to
refer
was
not
admitted
of
course
on
the
motion
for
the
summary
judgment.
at
the
time
of
the
summary
judgment,
it
was
decided
on
affidavit.
this
evidence
came
in,
in
the
course
of
the
trial
on
the
section
2
issues,
it
was
offered
with
respect
to
intent.
however,
it
seems
to
us
that
all
the
evidence
that
is
relevant
to
the
failing
company
defense
was
introduced.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
there
was
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
yes,
this
was
after
the
record
was
closed.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
was
in
the
record
and
it
was
before
the
court.
it
was
before
the
court
of
course
when
the
court
made
this
finding
17.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh
yes,
they
object.
they
do
object
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
yes,
they
objected
all
the
way
to
our
motion
for
summary
judgment.
they
objected
to
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
did
--
in
some
cases
we
have
where
we
think
there
are
disputed
factual
issues.
on
the
other
hand,
in
situations
where
we
think
that
on
the
undisputed
facts,
we're
entitled
to
judgment,
we
have
supported
summary
judgment
and
your
honor
in
his
opinion
in
the
northern
pacific
case
upheld
the
grant
of
summary
judgment.
they
are
on
a
tying
agreement.
there
have
been
a
number
of
cases
of
course
in
which
summary
judgment
has
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
view
of
all
the
other
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
are
only
two
items
of
evidence
that
they
claim
they
should
have
had
the
right
to
introduce
on
the
question
of
failing
company
that
was
not
introduced.
we
think
neither
of
those
is
relevant.
first
to
some
statistics
as
to
the
financial
condition
of
the
citizen
on
the
1920s
that
seem
to
us
is
too
remote.
secondly,
as
some
statements
by
various
people
in
the
tucson
area
which
is
printed
in
the
record
as
to
the
importance
of
having
two
papers
in
tucson,
again
it
seems
to
us
that's
irrelevant.
now
let
me
come
to
the
specific
issues.
i'd
like
to
start
with
something
because
the
argument
is
put
in
terms
of
failing
company.
is
it
--
was
it
a
failing
company
and
they
say
basically
mr.
maclaury
says,
just
look
at
the
balance
sheet,
that's
enough.
now,
failing
company
is
really
a
shorthand
phrase
we
think.
failing
company
is
a
shorthand
phrase
with
a
basic
concept
that
when
a
company
is
in
such
serious
condition
and
has
such
serious
problems
that
it
appears
that
it
is
about
to
go
out
of
the
market
anyhow,
then
its
acquisition
via
competitor
is
not
substantially
less
in
competition
because
it
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
and
we
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
i
think
mr.
justice,
i
think,
i
suggest
that
if
this
management
is
willing
to
keep
it
going,
it
is
at
that
time
a
viable
entity
in
terms
of
the
purpose
of
the
failing
company
defense.
that
is
if
the
entity
--
he
is
able
to
keep
going,
if
the
entity
is
able
to
keep
going,
if
the
man
is
willing
to
keep
it
going
for
a
while,
it
seems
to
me
that
refutes
the
claim
that
its
elimination
through
a
merger
will
not
substantially
lessen
competition.
now
let
me
come
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
surely.
yes
of
course.
let
me
come
to
these
items
of
evidence
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
though
we
--
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
there
are
many
of
these
situations
--
a
publisher
may
have
hopes
of
rehabilitating
the
paper
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
hope.
i
would
think
so
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right
because
it's
continuing
as
an
operating
entity
in
the
market.
now,
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
just
come
to
these
items
of
evidence
that
we
have
here.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
--
he
did
for
many
years.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
first
of
all,
the
initial
overtures
about
making
this
arrangement
came
not
from
the
citizen
which
allegedly
was
the
failing
company
but
from
the
other
paper,
from
the
star.
now
this
is
directly
in
contrast
with
the
international
shoe
case
where
the
overtures
came
from
the
failing
company.
it
seems
to
us,
this
is
of
some
significance
cause
normally
if
a
company
feels
that
it
can't
go
on
it
would
take
the
initiative.
now
in
the
international
shoe
case,
this
court
found
that
the
controlling
purpose
of
international
in
acquiring
the
mcelwain
company,
the
failing
company
there
was
to
get
additional
plans
for
its
business
which
it
could
not
have
been
quickly
hope
to
make.
and
in
its
discussion
of
what
it
was
holding
as
to
that,
the
acquisition
of
the
company
in
those
circumstances
would
not
violate
section
7.
it
put
in
as
a
qualification.
the
--
in
the
passage
which
the
appellants
themselves
quote
in
their
brief
at
page
41
that
the
purchase
of
the
competitor
there
was
not
and
i
?not
with
a
purpose
to
lessen
competition.?
and
that
of
course
is
exactly
the
opposite
of
the
purpose
the
district
court
found
was
involved
here.
now,
initially
in
1936,
a
small
purchase,
only
a
25%
interest
in
the
paper,
over
the
next
three
years,
he
increased
his
share
of
the
paper
from
25
to
75%.
it's
been
suggested
that
he
made
attempts
to
finance
the
paper
and
they
were
unsuccessful
in
this
interval.
the
record
shows
at
pages
205
to
206
that
these
attempts,
he
merely
spoke
to
three
people
he
knew,
a
retired
man,
a
man
who
just
moved
to
arizona
and
asked
him,
wouldn't
he
perhaps
like
to
put
some
money
into
the
paper
and
they
refused.
when
those
three
people
refused
to
do
so,
mr.
small
decided
to
move
to
tucson
from
chicago
and
what
he
said
--
what
the
district
court
found
when
he
testified
was,
he
said
--
he
decided
to
come
out
himself
at
page
206
of
the
record,
he
said,
"i
felt
that
i
could
carry
the
deficit
from
some
little
time."
there's
nothing
to
indicate
at,
that
when
this
operating
agreement
was
entered
into
that
mr.
small
had
any
intention
of
liquidating
the
citizen.
that
there's
no
indication
he
tried
any
steps
to
improve
its
financial
condition
and
there's
nothing
to
show
he
made
any
efforts
to
try
to
sell
it
to
others.
now
as
to
the
financial
condition
of
the
paper,
it
is
true,
the
citizen
for
a
number
of
years
had
been
losing
money.
however,
between
1938
and
1939
just
before
the
time
that
mr.
small
came
out
or
during
this
period,
the
paper's
condition
improved.
its
circulation
in
those
--
between
those
two
years
went
up
22%.
its
deficit
was
reduced.its
advertising
had
gone
up
and
its
operating
revenues
had
gone
up.
now
the
appellants
tried
us
and
say
we've
made
an
unfair
comparison
because
they
say
1938
was
the
worst
year
of
the
citizen
and
we
shouldn't
compare
it
with
1939.
but
of
course
it
seems
not
unlikely
perhaps
that
this
was
the
turning
in
the
citizen
of
course
and
this
was
the
situation.
this
was
the
situation
that
the
citizen
was
faced
with
when
it
decided
to
enter
into
this
operating
agreement.
it
saw
--
this
was
--
it
was
at
this
point
that
mr.
small
when
these
improvements
seem
to
be
developing
that
he
decided
to
come
out
to
tucson
to
play
a
more
active
role
in
the
paper
and
he
said
to
carry
it
along
for
a
little
while.
and
finally
--
oh,
one
other
thing,
i
might
mention,
that
on
the
--
there
have
been
a
reference
to
the
balance
sheet,
that
a
substantial
portion
of
these
liabilities
as
mr.
maclaury
has
indicated
belongs
to
stockholders
and
finally,
as
to
the
present
condition,
as
to
the
present,
the
claim
is
a
pro
forma
earning
statement
in
which
we
point
out
what
we
think
there's
some
deficiencies
on
it.
but
it
seems
to
us,
the
answer
to
all
of
this
argument
that
the
citizen
was
equally
certain
to
fail
again
if
it
was
now
required
to
terminate
this
profit
pooling,
price
fixing
and
division
of
market,
provisions
of
the
agreement
is
the
district
court's
three
findings
at
page
98
to
99,
findings
number
190
to
192
which
says
that
the
joint
trading
and
distribution
of
the
star
does
not
depend
upon
these
provisions
that
the
restoration
of
competition
requires
that
they
have
separate
advertising
and
circulation
requirements.
and
finally,
finding
192,
the
court
says,
"it
is
impossible
to
predict
with
any
substantial
degree
of
completeness
what
the
operating
results
of
either
newspaper
will
be
in
a
competitive
situation."
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon
me.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
yes,
we
think
it's
impossible
to
predict.
that
is
it
cannot
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
think
it's
impossible
to
predict
how
well
they
will
do.
in
other
words,
you
cannot
say
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
so.
i
think
so,
but
the
district
court
certainly
said
that
he
could
not
make
the
prediction
that
if
these
provisions
were
cancelled
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
we
don't
agree
with
that
mr.
justice.
and
therefore
it
seems
to
us
that
this
find
--
this
evidence
to
which
i
referred,
i
will
point
one
other
thing.
it's
rather
interesting
that
although
the
citizen
allegedly
was
failing
in
1940
and
presumably
under
their
theory
of
quickly
going
out
of
business,
the
star
was
willing
to
give
the
citizen
a
very
substantial
share
of
the
joint
operating
revenue.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
about
three-and-a-half
times
as
much.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
each
of
them.
they
had
roughly
the
same
circulation
in
1965
about
40,000
each.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
know
that.
as
i
say
that
the
--
although
the
publisher
testified,
although
publisher
testified
that
the
reason
he
was
so
generous
is
he
wanted
to
preserve
two
operating
voices
in
tucson.
it
seems
one
can
legitimately
ask
whether
perhaps
he
wasn't
also
anxious
to
avoid
the
possibility
that
this
new
man
coming
in
might
create
a
very
serious
competitor
for
him
or
might
perhaps
sell
the
paper
to
someone
else
who
would
be
in
a
position
to
be
a
more
vigorous
competitor.
so
that
what
you
have
here
is
that
the
--
these
two
people
got
together
and
attempted
to
solve
the
financial
problems
with
the
paper
by
eliminating
all
competition
between
them.
and
we
think
that
the
district
court
was
fully
justified
in
his
--
in
its
finding
that
in
1940
citizen
was
not
on
the
verge
of
going
business
and
it
was
not
a
serious
probability
at
that
time
that
citizen
would
liquid
--
be
liquidate
and
dissolve
unless
it
entered
into
this
agreement.
now,
i
would
just
very
briefly,
we
developed
it
in
our
brief,
in
my
remaining
time,
just
say
something
on
the
claim
that
if
the
court
disagrees
with
us
and
thinks
that
this
finding
is
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
well
that
ties
us
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
finding
that
they
were
not
a
failing
company,
in
other
words,
if
the
court
would
think
that
the
district
court
was
clearly
erroneous
and
we
think
he
was
correct.
but
if
the
court
should
disagree
with
us,
i'd
like
just
briefly
to
indicate,
to
sketch
to
the
court
the
reasons
we
think
the
district
court
still
properly
condemned
these
restraints
as
per
se
illegal.
the
attempt
was
to
analogize
this
to
a
partial
merger.
now,
of
course,
as
i've
indicated,
we
are
not
challenging
the
operating
agreement
but
only
parts
of
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
a
merger
basically
is
a
single
transaction
which
has
some
obvious
anticompetitive
effects,
that
is
if
competitors
combine
and
eliminates
the
competition
between
them.
on
the
other
hand,
it
may
have
some
benefits.
it
may
lead
to
an
improvement
of
the
structure
of
the
operating
assets.
it
may
need
to
--
lead
to
some
useful
economies.
so
that
it's
impossible
on
a
merger
to
separate
out
the
anticompetitive
and
the
precompetitive
things.
so,
we
have
to
do
is
make
an
over
all
judgment
as
to
whether
or
not
the
total
effect
of
the
merger
maybe
substantially
to
lessen
competition.
but
this
is
a
very
different
kind
of
a
thing.
this
is
a
very
different
kind
of
beast.
here
what
we
have
is
this
agreement
with
separable
provisions.
some
of
it,
you
could
just
put
your
fingers
on
this
provisions
and
see
the
provision
for
price
fixing
obviously
eliminates
competition.
the
provision
for
profit
pooling
obviously
eliminates
competition.
the
provision
that
they
will
not
engage
in
any
other
publishing
business
obviously
eliminates
competition.
we
think
those
can
be
tested
under
the
traditional
per
se
rules
and
found
illegal.
conversely,
the
provisions
for
joint
printing,
for
joint
distribution,
these
are
things
which
can
also
be
tested
and
these
are
plainly
not
illegal.
they
do
not
restrain
competition
and
therefore
for
that
reason
the
government
has
not
challenged
and
it
seems
to
us
that
once
again
if
i
may
come
back
to
what
i
said
earlier,
that
basically
this
is
a
plea
by
the
appellants
for
special
rules
for
the
newspaper
business.
i
think
if
you
have
this
kind
of
situation
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
there
--
they
still
are
i
think
mr.
justice
because
they
urge
this
as
a
merger.
and
it
seems
to
me
even
assuming
if
this
were
failing,
we
suggest
this
is
not
like
a
merger
that
this
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
that
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
that's
where
we
part
company
with
them
mr.
justice.
and
we
part
company
with
them
because
we
think
that
in
the
merger
field,
in
the
merger
field,
you
have
to
look
at
the
merger
as
a
whole
body.
you
have
to
look
at
it
as
a
whole
body
whereas
this
type
of
thing
we
do
not
think
can
be
analogized
to
a
merger
because
we
think
here
you
can
separate
out
the
good
and
the
bad
and
that
there
are
very
different
considerations
that
are
applicable
here.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
except
mr.
justice,
the
two
are
very
interrelated.
the
two
are
very
interrelated
in
that
sense
that
it
is
not
it
seems
to
us
the
same
thing
as
though
you
have
the
two
of
them
combining
into
one
business.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
you
have
immediately
more
but
there
are
--
there
are
countervailing
considerations
which
we
suggest
perhaps
the
effect
of
a
combination
leaves
the
market
open
for
someone
else
to
come
in.
here,
what
you
have
is
these
two
papers
are
kept
going
with
this
agreement
which
restrains
competition.
this
in
effect
has
pretty
--
completely
occupy
the
market
and
it's
occupied
the
market
by
means
of
this
elimination
of
competition.
it
just
seems
to
us,
if
the
problems
of
the
newspapers
is
such
that
there
should
be
relief
in
this
situation,
we
think
this
is
this
bill
which
is
before
congress.
we
have
opposed
the
bill
but
we
think
that
that
is
the
appropriate
for
redress
in
this
situation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
where
they
do
their
business.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
its
--
in
a
sense,
it
is
mr.
justice,
that's
where
they
make
or
lose
their
money
but
of
course
--
but
of
course,
how
well
they're
going
to
do
on
circulation?
how
well
they're
going
to
do
on
advertising
depend
on
circulation?
how
well
they're
going
to
do
on
circulation
depend
upon
how
good
their
paper
is.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
what
he
has
done
mr.
justice
is
this,
they
have
not
here
--
they
have
not
appealed
from
the
finding
that
the
merger
of
the
two
papers,
they
actually
merged
in
1965.
he
--
they
have
not
appealed
from
that
and
they
agreed
that
divestiture
is
appropriate.
now
what
the
court
did
in
addition
to
ordering
divestiture
of
the
two
papers,
the
court
went
on
and
said
that
in
such
divestiture,
they
had
to
modify
the
operating
agreement
to
eliminate
these
three
provisions
which
resulted
in
the
joint
business
act.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
that's
right.
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
was
a
finding
on
section
7
at
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
section
7
issue
mr.
justice
white
its
related
only
to
the
year
1965.
it
was
an
acquisition
by
citizen
of
star
stock
in
1965.
we
make
--
we
do
not
contest
that
ruling.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
sect
--
yes,
but
it
was
not
challenged
under
section
7.
it
was
challenged
only
under
section
1.
the
1940
transaction
was
challenged
only
under
section
1.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
they
had
challenged
it
under
section
7,
yes
but
actually
the
burden
on
the
government
in
bringing
this
case
under
section
1
was
far
greater
it
would've
been
had
they
challenged
it
under
section
7.
they
did
not
challenge
the
1940
operating
agreement
under
section
7.
so,
at
the
close
of
trial,
after
we'd
had
a
great
deal
of
testimony
on
the
question
whether
there
was
a
violation
of
section
2
and
the
primary
issue
there
was
(1)
intent
to
acquire
power
over
the
market
and
(2)
relief.
we
put
in
a
great
deal
of
testimony
including
the
testimony
and
evidence
concerning
the
failing
condition
of
citizen
so
as
to
show
that
these
people
really
had
no
intent
to
monopolize
but
their
intent
was
to
rehabilitate
these
two
newspapers.
now,
section
1
was
not
in
the
case
at
that
time.
it
had
been
eliminated
by
summary
judgment
and
at
the
close
of
trial,
we
moved
not
quite
in
terms
of
--
stated
by
the
solicitor
general.
what
our
motion
was
that
the
court
reopened
the
trial
and
permit
the
--
set
aside
its
summary
judgment
on
section
1
and
permit
the
government
to
adduce
evidence
on
that
issue
and
permit
us
to
rebut
that
evidence
and
also
to
apply
to
that
issue
all
of
the
evidence
that
we
had
adduced
under
section
2.
now
the
court
denied
that
motion
and
refused
to
set
aside
its
ruling
on
summary
judgment
that
section
1
was
a
violation.
so
its
not
--
i
don't
think
a
proper
statement
of
the
record
to
say
that
the
court
considered
in
a
section
1
context
all
of
the
evidence
on
the
failing
company
doctrine.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
do
not
your
honor.
i
find
--
i
think
this
that
in
1965,
the
court
needed
only
to
find
that
if
the
operating
agreement
should
abrogated
then
one
company
would
fail.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
your
honor,
the
section
7
violation,
i
haven't
argued
here
at
all.
the
section
7
violation
which
was
charged
was
an
acquisition
by
citizen
of
the
stock
of
star
in
1965.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
we
make
--
we
do
not
contest
that
finding.
we
do
not
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
neither
company
was
failing
at
that
time.
we
do
not
contest
that
rule.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
the
companies
at
the
journalistic
level
and
we
have
asked
this
court
to
reverse
the
section
1
issue
and
for
with
us
to
sell,
permit
citizen
to
sell
star
promptly
as
we
had
always
advised
the
government
in
the
fist
place,
that's
what
we
intended
to
do
when
we
acquired
it.
we
have
--
the
citizen
has
no
intent
and
no
desire
to
retain
star.
it
was
their
intent
at
the
time
they
required
it
to
promptly
dispose
of
it.
so
we
raised
no
issue
there.
the
only
issue
we
raised
on
the
1965
transaction
is
that
if
this
court
should
sustain
the
district
court's
ruling
on
abrogating
the
main
clauses
of
the
operating
agreement
so
that
citizen
then
would
be
likely
to
go
into
a
failing
condition
that
citizen
on
this
be
given
the
option
of
disposing
of
either
star
or
citizen
because
the
whole
game
has
been
changed.
and
that's
the
same
option
that
the
government
recently
gave
in
a
consent
decree
to
the
gannett
newspapers
in
rockford,
illinois
where
the
gannett
newspapers
acquired
a
radio
and
in
consenting
to
dispose
of
one
or
the
other,
the
government
agreed
that
the
newspaper
could
at
their
choice,
dispose
of
either
the
radio
station
or
the
newspaper.
and
i
just
like
to
close
again
to
--
and
then
close
into
the
state
that
i'm
satisfied
and
on
examination
the
court
will
be
satisfied
that
the
cause
of
the
conflict
between
the
findings
of
fact
in
number
14,
finding
14
and
15
of
the
financial
condition
of
citizen
that
it
could
not
have
met
that
by
finding
17,
by
conclusion
in
finding
17
that
citizen
in
1940
was
not
a
failing
company.
all
it
intended
to
do
was
to
say
that
mr.
small
was
willing
and
continue
at
that
time
to
reach
down
deeper
in
his
pocket
to
finance
--
continue
to
finance
that
failing
company.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
your
honor.
about
one
year,
almost
one
year
after
the
case
was
tried,
9
months
after
and
i
might
add
to
that
finding
17
was
not
proposed
by
the
government,
it
was
not
proposed
by
the
defendants,
it
was
a
finding
arrived
at
by
the
court
on
which
it
heard
no
argument.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
just
the
section
2
issue
and
the
section
7
issue.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
because
the
district
court's
order
orders
the
owner
of
citizen
to
dispose
of
star
and
does
not
give
them
that
choice
that
they
must
dispose
of
star.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
