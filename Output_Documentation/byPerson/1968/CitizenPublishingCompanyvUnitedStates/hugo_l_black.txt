justice

black
oh,
i
understand
now
that
you
are
denying?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
--
understand
now
that
you
are
denying
the
assumption
of
my
brother
harlan's
questions
that
this
newspaper
then
became
one
voice
or
two
voices,
what
was
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
after
the
merger?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
after
whatever
it
was?
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
they
owned
by
the
same
people?
justice
hugo
l.
black
separately
owned?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
challenge
to
--
i
think,
it
was
for
summary
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
objected
--
did
they
object
at
the
beginning?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
the
government
had
been
taking
the
position
at
least
at
some
cases,
summary
judgment
was
not
coupled
in
an
antitrust
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
finding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
the
judge
ordered,
was
it
not,
a
separate
means
of
the
advertising
department
and
the
circulation
department?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
where
they
do
their
business?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
where
they
make
or
lose
their
money?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
ordered
to
separate
it
as
i
understand
it,
the
two
parts
of
the
business
where
they
do
their
business,
which
is
what
the
antitrust
law
was
aimed
at?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
he
actually
found
as
i
read
it,
look
at
it,
or
is
it,
if
you
let
him
combine
these
two,
that
its
situation
is
wide
open
to
be
affected
and
whatever
they
publish
through
the
paper?
justice
hugo
l.
black
competition
in
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
competition
in
seeking
advertisements
--
in
selling
advertisements?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
circulation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
is
none.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
in
each
one,
say
what
they
want
to
but
each
one
agree
with
one
another,
there
will
be
no
competition
between
them
in
the
circulation
and
the
other
department?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
suppressed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
can
you
say
it
--
i'm
asking
--
i
want
to
get
the
argument,
how
can
you
say
it's
not
suppressed
by
its
advertising;
distribution
is
when
they
are
as
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
alright
but
you'd
till
get
to
the
question
whether
he
made
this
finding.
whether
when
they
are
one
in
their
advertising
and
circulation
that
you
have
not
completely
suppressed
circulation
and
that
--
in
those
two
departments?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
where
their
money
coming
in
and
going
out
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
then
when
all
of
it
--
they
were
getting
some
advertising
money.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
some
circulation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
but
even
if
they
were
not
they
didn't
--
then
they
didn't
have
the
fact
of
the
other
freedom
to
control
themselves
with
reference
that
have
been
part
of
their
business.
