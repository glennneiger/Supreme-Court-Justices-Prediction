mr.
kenneth
watkins
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
this
court's
decision
in
harper
versus
virginia
state
board
of
elections
applies
to
a
local
revenue
bond
election
limited
to
property
taxpayers
who
have
no
special
interest
in
the
election
which
would
warrant
their
limitation.
the
facts
of
this
case
may
be
briefly
stated
as
follows.
this
suit
was
brought
by
joseph
q.
cipriano
as
a
class
action.
mr.
cipriano
is
a
resident
of
and
a
duly
registered
and
qualified
voter
in
the
city
of
houma,
louisiana.
the
plaintiff
does
not
own
any
real
property
in
the
city
of
houma
nor
does
he
pay
any
property
taxes
on
any
such
property.
on
october
24,
1967,
an
election
was
held
pursuant
to
the
statute
challenged
in
this
suit
to
authorize
the
issuance
of
utility
revenue
bonds.
under
the
applicable
statute,
the
election
was
specifically
limited
to
resident,
property
taxpayers,
appellant
and
all
similarly
situation
--
situated
persons
who
are
prohibitive
from
voting
in
this
election
by
the
effect
of
the
statute.
the
purpose
of
the
election
was
to
obtain
authorization
from
the
electorate
to
issue
$10
million
worth
of
utility
revenue
bonds
with
which
to
expand
the
utility
system
of
the
city
of
houma.
the
election
received
a
favorable
vote
by
the
property
taxpayers.
of
the
11,606
registered
voters
in
the
city
of
houma,
4,680
are
property
taxpayers.
of
that
latter
number,
2,724
actually
voted
in
this
election,
1,828
voted
in
favor
of
this
proposition,
896
against
it.
the
appellant
brought
this
suit
within
the
60-day
period
allowed
and
provided
for
by
louisiana
statute
and
contesting
--
contested
the
constitutionality
of
the
voter
classification
or
qualification.
the
trial
court
and
the
divided
opinion
with
the
dissent
by
justice
wisdom
rejected
appellant's
contention
and
from
that
decision
of
a
three-judge
court,
the
appellant
appeals
to
this
court.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
under
the
law,
it
is
required
your
honor
that
there
be
a
majority
in
both
number
and
amount
as
we
shall
point
out.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
in
number
of
the
taxpayers,
voting
and
a
majority
of
the
assessed
property
owned
by
those
taxpayers
who
are
actually
voting
them.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
yes
sir.
all
revenue
--
it's
important
to
note
that
all
revenue
derived
from
the
operation
of
the
utility
system
over
and
above
that
first
revenue
dedicated
to
repaying
the
bond
goes
into
the
general
fund
of
the
city
of
houma
and
is
used
for
general
city
services.
now
we
make
special
note
of
the
fact
that
this
is
a
utility,
revenue
bond
election
as
distinguished
from
bonds
which
are
payable
from
the
proceeds
of
property
or
ad
valorem
taxes.
the
applicable
statutes
provide
that
the
revenue
bonds
authorized
by
this
election
shall
be
repaid
exclusively
and
solely
from
the
income
derived
from
the
operation
of
the
utility.
and
we
maintain
that
by
this
limitation
it's
conceded
effectively
precludes
or
prohibits
the
imposition
or
use
of
any
tax
money
to
repay
these
bonds.
additionally,
the
statutes
also
provide
that
the
full
faith
and
credit
of
the
issuing
authority
is
not
at
stake.
only
the
pledged
revenues
of
the
utility
are
allowed
to
secure
the
repayment
of
these
bonds.
as
i
shall
show,
a
property
owner
has
no
greater
stake
or
interest
in
this
election
than
in
nonproperty
owner
as
neither
his
property
nor
his
property
rights
can
in
any
way
be
effected
by
the
outcome
of
this
election.
now,
the
statute
of
the
state
of
louisiana
which
required
the
ownership
of
property
we
maintain
therefore
invidiously
discriminating
this
instance
against
the
appellant
and
members
of
his
class
who
together
comprise
60%
of
the
registered
voters
of
the
city
of
houma.
firstly,
as
i
have
stated
the
property
owner
as
such
incurs
no
liability
contingent
or
otherwise
for
the
repayment
of
the
bonds.
secondly,
as
the
use
of
utilities
which
property
owners
and
nonproperty
owners
are
like
used,
he
encourage
no
peculiar
liability
as
neither
the
property
owner
nor
his
property
is
in
anyway
peculiarly
liable
for
the
service
or
utility
charge
or
for
the
connection
charge.
it's
a
contractual
obligation
in
louisiana
between
the
user
and
the
supplier.
and
thirdly,
if
the
proposition
to
be
voted
on
is
economically
sound
and
this
would
result
in
an
increase
in
revenue
over
and
above
the
bond
repayment
funds
going
into
the
general
city
coffers
so
to
speak,
this
is
beneficial
to
all
taxpayers
and
all
residents
of
the
city
of
houma.
if
on
the
other
hand,
the
proposition
will
approve
economically
unsound
resulting
in
less
money
going
into
the
general
fund,
this
would
adversely
affect
all
citizens
as
additional
tax
money
may
be
necessary
to
run
the
city.
since
over
90%
of
the
total
money
generated
as
revenues
for
the
city
of
houma
well
over
90%
come
from
sources
other
than
property
taxes,
we
maintain
that
the
greater
interest
lies
with
that
group
or
classification
who
pays
more
than
90%
of
the
funds
into
the
general
treasury
of
the
city
and
this
would
be
the
general
electorate
and
the
general
citizenry
of
the
city
of
houma.
the
property
owner,
a
review
of
the
stipulation
of
facts
at
page
19
and
20
of
the
single
appendix,
paragraphs
7
and
8,
together
with
the
official
audit
of
the
city
of
houma.
now
the
official
annual
audit
of
the
city
of
houma
for
the
year
ending
september
30,
1968
shows
the
gross
revenues
of
the
city
and
this
official
audit
of
course
covers
the
period
of
this
election
which
was
october
1967
through
that
same
period
in
1968.
when
these
two
items
are
combined
and
analyzed,
it
shows
that
property
owners
pay
substantially
less
than
10%
of
the
total
revenues
of
the
city.
we
believe
that
the
case
of
harper
versus
virginia
state
board
of
elections
is
controlling
in
this
instance.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
i
don't
believe
it's
necessary
for
me
to
go
that
far,
your
honor,
in
the
sense
that
we
can
show
here
that
there
is
absolutely
no
relevancy
and
no
possibility
of
attacks
being
used.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
they
may
be
your
honor
to
both.
but
in
the
harper
case,
this
court
was
consigned
with
the
requirement
of
the
payment
of
the
poll
taxes
of
qualification
to
vote.
in
this
case,
we
are
concerned
with
the
requirement
of
the
payment
of
a
property
tax
as
a
qualification
to
vote.
in
the
harper
case,
this
court
declared
that
voter
qualification
has
no
relation
to
wealth
nor
to
the
paying
or
not
paying
of
this
or
any
other
tax.
in
fact,
we
maintain
that
the
present
case
presents
to
this
court
an
easier
question
than
did
harper.
now
the
dissenting
justices
in
harper
suggested
that
the
state
of
virginia
may
have
had
a
valid
interest
in
the
poll
tax
either
in
deciding
to
collect
additional
revenue
or
in
believing
that
the
voters
who
pay
the
poll
tax
comprise
a
group
which
may
have
been
more
interested
in
the
general
welfare
of
the
state.
under
the
facts
of
the
present
case,
neither
of
these
contentions
can
be
taken
seriously
here.
as
i
have
illustrated
the
property
owning
taxpayer
has
no
interests
in
the
outcome
of
the
revenue
bond
election
greater
than
any
other
voter.
in
fact,
as
a
group,
they
have
decided
a
less
interest
as
they
pay
less
than
10%
of
the
total
revenues
of
the
city
of
houma.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
sir?
mr.
kenneth
watkins
no
sir,
your
honor.
we
have
filed
our
suit
within
the
60-day
statutory
provision
allowed
by
louisiana
law
to
challenge
such
an
election
and
so
actually
no
rights
have
become
vested
in
this
case
nor
have
any
bonds
been
sold
or
nor
has
the
question
become
final.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
well,
without
wishing
to
presuppose
any
judgment
which
the
court
may
run,
i
will
suggest
as
we
have
in
our
reply
memorandum
your
honor
that
if
this
court
were
to
agree
with
us
that
it
may
limit,
if
you
will.
it
may
first
of
all
grant
us
the
relief
we
pray
for,
for
this
class
action
and
that
no
rights
have
become
vested
here
nor
have
any
bonds
issued
nor
had
the
matter
become
final.
we
suggested
in
our
reply
brief
that
the
court
may
limit
the
retrospective
effect
of
its
decision
to
those
cases
where
rights
have
not
become
final
or
where
bonds
have
not
been
issued
as
an
example,
i
think
we
may
have
pointed
out
your
honor.
if
the
election
had
actually
been
held
then
full
time
for
challenge
had
passed
and
the
local
authority
may
have
been
gone
on
planning
as
they
must
pre-plan,
we
appreciate
that,
there
would
be
no
manifest
ill
or
no
adverse
effect
by
allowing
that
one
to
stand
since
the
time
for
challenging
had
passed.
obviously,
where
bonds
have
been
issued
the
same
rule
would
apply,
rights
have
become
vested.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
i
think
the
court
clearly
has
the
authority
to
give
its
decision
to
that
effect.
we
have
--
they
can
grant
us
the
relief
prayed
for
us.
no
rights
have
become
vested
nor
the
matter
was
not
finalized
and
the
court
could
limit
the
effect
of
its
decision
to
those
cases
where
rights
have
not
become
vested
and
where
it
has
not
become
final.
i
may
point
out
--
mr.
kenneth
watkins
sir?
mr.
kenneth
watkins
yes,
your
honor.
i
appreciate
that
and
i
can
sincerely
differentiate
between
the
dire
consequences
the
court
might
have
encountered
in
saying
that
we
will
wholly
completely
legislate
your
ill
apportion
and
therefore
acts
passed
are
invalid.
rights
may
have
become
vested.
the
court
has
an
obligation
to
preserve
order
and
i
think
this
was
to
a
large
extent
the
court's
concern
preserving
the
due
process
of
order,
so
to
speak.
in
this
case
this
does
not
occur
your
honor.
no
rights
have
become
vested
in
this
instance.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
well,
where
the
elections
--
mr.
kenneth
watkins
where
the
bonds
have
been
issued
as
we
have
spoken
with
mr.
justice
fortas.
where
bonds
have
been
issued,
rights
have
become
final
and
vested.
and
we
see
no
difficulty
in
the
court
limiting
the
effect
of
its
decision,
clearly,
to
those
cases
where
rights
have
not
become
vested
such
as
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
i'm
sorry
sir?
mr.
kenneth
watkins
i'm
not
sure
your
honor
that
at
which
time
you
may
have
to
do
it.
this
is
one
suggestion
only
of
the
way
in
which
you
may
do
it
in
keeping
what
we
consider
the
ruling
of
this
court
in
the
mapp
and
linkletter
decisions.
it's
an
analogy
to
the
application
of
this
court
of
the
mapp
decision
and
the
linkletter
case.
we
may
additionally
point
out
in
this
case,
your
honor
that
not
only
is
the
qualification
of
paying
a
tax
violative
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
set
forth
in
the
harper
case
but
the
--
the
qualification
of
wealth
is
given
added
emphasis.
in
this
case,
the
property
tax
presupposes
the
ownership
of
property
in
addition
to
the
payment
of
this
tax
and
the
degree
of
wealth
is
even
made
a
factor
in
the
present
case
by
the
statutory
requirement
that
the
proposition
be
voted
favorably
upon
by
a
majority
in
number
of
voters
and
a
majority
in
the
assessed
evaluation
of
the
property
owned
by
the
voters.
therefore,
the
wealthier
vote
is
given
a
weighted
effect.
the
wealthier
man
has
a
weightier
vote.
it
is
appellant's
decision
--
mr.
kenneth
watkins
that
is
correct
sir
but
if
this
rich
man
owns
real
estate,
he
is
given
a
weighted
vote.
the
court
below
surmised
some
possible
rational
purpose
for
the
limitation
and
we
submit
that
absolutely
non-exist
for
the
three
reasons
that
we
have
previously
given
this
court.
appellees
have
previously
advanced
the
purpose
that
advance
the
suggestion
that
the
legislative
purpose
for
the
distinction
in
this
voter
classification
was
and
i
quote,
“the
desire
to
place
a
check
upon
borrowing
by
governmental
units
at
page
5
of
the
trial
brief.”
we
submit
that
if
that
classification
was
permissible,
it
has
no
relevance
or
whatsoever
to
the
purpose
of
this
legislation.
to
the
contrary,
the
total
absence
of
liability
peculiar
to
the
taxpayer
or
to
his
property
effectively
invites
him
to
vote
with
more
or
less
unrestrained
enthusiasm.
exhibits
p1
through
p7
clearly
show
that
the
proponents
of
the
bond
issued
constantly
advice
the
taxpayers
that
a
favorable
vote
would
protect
his
low
property
tax
rate
and
no
new
taxes
could
be
added.
in
the
present
case,
all
citizens
have
an
equal
proprietary
interest
in
revenues,
equal
proprietary
interest
in
city
owned
properties.
all
citizens
pay
taxes
into
the
general
fund
as
we
have
shown
a
comparison
of
the
1968
audit
of
the
fiscal
year
ending
september
30,
1968
together
with
the
stipulation
of
fact
shows
that
well
over
90%
of
the
revenues
are
paid
by
the
general
electorate
of
the
general
citizenry.
now,
we
maintain
that
there's
absolutely
no
justification
your
honor,
for
this
classification
as
set
forth
in
this
particular
statute.
i
may
call
to
this
court's
attention
the
fact
that
a
casual
comparison
if
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
of
the
three
different
sections
of
chapter
10
of
the
title
33
of
the
louisiana
revised
statutes
indicates
that
the
legislature
provided
three
different
methods
for
submitting
the
same
general
proposition
to
the
voters.
subsection
b
provides
for
a
bond
election,
subsection
d
and
subsection
c
--
b,
c,
and
d.
the
city
elected
to
use
subsection
c
and
of
the
three
subsections,
this
is
the
only
one
that
restricts
the
vote
to
property
owners.
strangely
enough,
subsection
b
and
subsection
d
both
dealing
with
the
same
proposition,
both
dealing
with
the
same
authority,
both
pledging
revenues
and
city
properties
owned
by
everybody,
two
sections
allow
everybody
to
vote,
one
section
allows
only
property
owner.
we
submit
that
there
is
absolutely
no
justification
for
the
distinction.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
sir?
mr.
kenneth
watkins
well,
act
33
of
the
special
session
--
mr.
kenneth
watkins
we
maintain
has
no
--
mr.
kenneth
watkins
we
maintain
act
33
of
the
special
section
of
1968
your
honor
has
no
bearing
whatsoever
upon
this
case.
as
we
have
tried
to
point
out
to
the
court
in
our
reply
memorandum,
the
appellees
cite
a
particular
paragraph
as
being
a
paragraph
ratifying
this
election.
number
one,
it
is
very
strange
to
us
that
the
paragraph
which
appellees
claim
ratifies
this
election
never
uses
the
word
ratifies,
confirms,
or
in
any
way
have
sense
to
it.
the
next
paragraph
dealing
with
previously
issued
bonds
which
is
not
the
case
here
does
use
these
words,
ratify
and
confirmed.
your
honor
may
find
the
statute
quoted
at
page
17
of
the
appellees
brief.
i
did
not
reprint
it
as
the
appellees
have
reprinted
the
act
at
page
17
of
his
brief.
we
maintain
that
certainly
it
was
not
the
intention
of
the
legislature
to
ratify
this
election.
secondly,
we
maintain
that
the
legislature
cannot
ratify
action
taken
under
and
unconstitutional
state
act
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
to
do
so,
puts
an
action
of
the
state
legislature
of
louisiana
on
equal
footing
with
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
sir.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
kenneth
watkins
we
agree
with
you
your
honor
that
it
would
not
have
been
necessary
for
the
state
of
louisiana
probably
to
require
an
election
but
under
harper,
once
an
election
is
granted,
once
the
franchise
is
granted,
it
must
be
consistent
with
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
classification
--
mr.
kenneth
watkins
unless,
--
mr.
kenneth
watkins
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
once
the
fourth
--
once
the
election
of
franchise
is
granted
half
of
demands
that
it
be
granted
in
lines
consistent
with
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
may
point
out
this
to
you,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
but
i
point
this
out
to
you
your
honor.
if
you'll
notice
the
language
of
the
statute
itself,
it
says
that
in
the
event
a
property
taxpayer's
election,
i'm
quoting
form
page
18
the
last
paragraph
of
appellee's
brief
where
he
has
set
forth
the
statute,
“in
the
event
a
property
taxpayer's
election
has
heretofore
been
held
and
promulgated
approving
the
issuance
of
the
bonds.”
now,
even
if
we
were
to
conceive
which
we
do
not
that
the
state
of
louisiana
has
the
authority
to
validate
an
unconstitutional
act,
this
act
in
itself
is
unconstitutional.
we
maintain
and
that
it
recognizes
the
unfair
advantage
given
to
the
property
owner
because
this
paragraph
requires
that
you
have
had
an
election
and
obviously
you
must
have
had
it
under
this
present
statute
the
city
has
chosen
subpart
c.
and
if
you
have
had
an
election,
it
must
have
passed.
so
this
paragraph
recognizes
the
discrimination
and
requiring
a
previous
election
and
that
it
have
been
passed.
you
could
not
do
it,
according
to
this
paragraph,
if
the
city
of
houma
have
had
an
election
and
the
bonds
have
been
voted
down,
this
paragraph
would
not
be
applicable.
and
we
maintain
even
to
the
extent
that
they
recognize
the
discrimination
of
the
present
statute
in
this
act,
this
act
itself
would
not
be
applicable
even
if
they
had
the
power
to
do
it
which
we
deny.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
that
is
correct,
sir.
if
your
honor
please,
i'd
like
to
save
the
remaining
part
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
thank
you.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
only
a
few
comments
i
think
i
would
like
to
make
with
respect
to
mr.
huppenbauer's
arguments.
number
one,
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
that
these
bonds
we're
talking
about
in
this
case
are
not
general
obligation
bonds
contrary
to
the
statistics
mr.
huppenbauer
referred
to
in
the
amicus
brief.
although
it
didn't
reflect
it
here,
the
statistics
in
the
amicus
brief
are
somewhat
misleading
and
that
that
the
real
gem
of
this
is
that
no
general
obligations
bonds
are
here,
no
tax
money
can
be
used,
and
that
the
statistics
showed
in
the
amicus
brief
failed
to
clearly
set
forth
the
number
of
states
where
the
general
obligation
bonds
are
not
in
effect.
we
believe
there
are
only
three
states
in
the
union
as
far
as
we
can
ascertain
from
our
research:
louisiana,
texas
and
idaho
that
had
any
requirement
even
similar
to
this
with
a
non-general
obligation
bond
in
question.
with
regard
to
the
--
mr.
huppenbauer's
argument
on
the
specter
of
confusion,
gentlemen,
it
simply
does
not
exist.
the
state
law
can
be
made
applicable
as
this
court
did
in
linkletter.
whenever
the
state
law
determines
finality
to
an
issue
and
at
the
time
under
state
law
has
passed
to
challenge
that
issue,
this
is
an
easy
break
off
point,
should
the
court
decide
to
use
it
so
to
speak.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
in
this
case,
the
questions
have
not
become
from
final.
vested
rights
have
not
come
into
play.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
no,
sir
i
can't
offhand
tell
you
that
your
honor.
i'd
be
glad
to
have
that
matter
checked
and
submitted
to
the
court
if
the
court
would
feel
that
it
would
want
it
but
i
cannot
--
i'm
not
prepared
to
give
the
court
that
statement
of
fact
as
to
the
number
of
states
that
required
in
months
instead
of
years.
i
would
certainly
assume
however
as
mr.
huppenbauer
has
actually
argued
that
every
state
has
some
period.
at
some
point,
you
have
to
have
your
finality
for
somebody
to
buy
the
bond.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
i
would
only
suggest
that
--
mr.
kenneth
watkins
i
would
only
suggest
that
the
question
of
years
is
an
old
probability
not
in
play
here
your
honor,
as
who
would
want
to
wait
years
before
they
can
sell
a
bond.
and
i'm
sure
nobody
would
want
to
buy
a
bond
where
the
right
matter
had
not
become
final
as
mr.
huppenbauer
had
suggested.
they
have
to
have
an
opinion
from
a
competent
bond
attorney
and
this
competent
bond
attorney
is
much
certainly
certified
that
at
the
time
the
challenge
has
passed
and
i'm
sure
no
issuing
authority
would
want
to
wait
several
years
before
they
issue
the
bonds
so
they
must
be
one.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
a
town
of
about
35,000
people
now,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
i
would
estimate
that,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
well,
the
question
is
this
your
honor,
if
we
go
into
that
phase
of
it,
not
necessarily
a
question
of
revenue
at
stake
but
as
we
discussed
earlier,
this
is
a
question
of
possibly
using
revenue
in
lieu
of
taxes
and
not
giving
the
majority
of
people
a
right
to
vote
on
it.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
well
the
real
interest
of
that
company,
i
couldn't
say
mrs.
cipriano
does
work
for
him
but
we
do
have
6,000
other
plaintiffs,
this
is
a
class
action.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
this
court's
decision
in
harper
versus
virginia
state
board
of
elections
applies
to
a
local
revenue
bond
election
limited
to
property
taxpayers
who
have
no
special
interest
in
the
election
which
would
warrant
their
limitation.
the
facts
of
this
case
may
be
briefly
stated
as
follows.
this
suit
was
brought
by
joseph
q.
cipriano
as
a
class
action.
mr.
cipriano
is
a
resident
of
and
a
duly
registered
and
qualified
voter
in
the
city
of
houma,
louisiana.
the
plaintiff
does
not
own
any
real
property
in
the
city
of
houma
nor
does
he
pay
any
property
taxes
on
any
such
property.
on
october
24,
1967,
an
election
was
held
pursuant
to
the
statute
challenged
in
this
suit
to
authorize
the
issuance
of
utility
revenue
bonds.
under
the
applicable
statute,
the
election
was
specifically
limited
to
resident,
property
taxpayers,
appellant
and
all
similarly
situation
--
situated
persons
who
are
prohibitive
from
voting
in
this
election
by
the
effect
of
the
statute.
the
purpose
of
the
election
was
to
obtain
authorization
from
the
electorate
to
issue
$10
million
worth
of
utility
revenue
bonds
with
which
to
expand
the
utility
system
of
the
city
of
houma.
the
election
received
a
favorable
vote
by
the
property
taxpayers.
of
the
11,606
registered
voters
in
the
city
of
houma,
4,680
are
property
taxpayers.
of
that
latter
number,
2,724
actually
voted
in
this
election,
1,828
voted
in
favor
of
this
proposition,
896
against
it.
the
appellant
brought
this
suit
within
the
60-day
period
allowed
and
provided
for
by
louisiana
statute
and
contesting
--
contested
the
constitutionality
of
the
voter
classification
or
qualification.
the
trial
court
and
the
divided
opinion
with
the
dissent
by
justice
wisdom
rejected
appellant's
contention
and
from
that
decision
of
a
three-judge
court,
the
appellant
appeals
to
this
court.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
under
the
law,
it
is
required
your
honor
that
there
be
a
majority
in
both
number
and
amount
as
we
shall
point
out.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
in
number
of
the
taxpayers,
voting
and
a
majority
of
the
assessed
property
owned
by
those
taxpayers
who
are
actually
voting
them.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
yes
sir.
all
revenue
--
it's
important
to
note
that
all
revenue
derived
from
the
operation
of
the
utility
system
over
and
above
that
first
revenue
dedicated
to
repaying
the
bond
goes
into
the
general
fund
of
the
city
of
houma
and
is
used
for
general
city
services.
now
we
make
special
note
of
the
fact
that
this
is
a
utility,
revenue
bond
election
as
distinguished
from
bonds
which
are
payable
from
the
proceeds
of
property
or
ad
valorem
taxes.
the
applicable
statutes
provide
that
the
revenue
bonds
authorized
by
this
election
shall
be
repaid
exclusively
and
solely
from
the
income
derived
from
the
operation
of
the
utility.
and
we
maintain
that
by
this
limitation
it's
conceded
effectively
precludes
or
prohibits
the
imposition
or
use
of
any
tax
money
to
repay
these
bonds.
additionally,
the
statutes
also
provide
that
the
full
faith
and
credit
of
the
issuing
authority
is
not
at
stake.
only
the
pledged
revenues
of
the
utility
are
allowed
to
secure
the
repayment
of
these
bonds.
as
i
shall
show,
a
property
owner
has
no
greater
stake
or
interest
in
this
election
than
in
nonproperty
owner
as
neither
his
property
nor
his
property
rights
can
in
any
way
be
effected
by
the
outcome
of
this
election.
now,
the
statute
of
the
state
of
louisiana
which
required
the
ownership
of
property
we
maintain
therefore
invidiously
discriminating
this
instance
against
the
appellant
and
members
of
his
class
who
together
comprise
60%
of
the
registered
voters
of
the
city
of
houma.
firstly,
as
i
have
stated
the
property
owner
as
such
incurs
no
liability
contingent
or
otherwise
for
the
repayment
of
the
bonds.
secondly,
as
the
use
of
utilities
which
property
owners
and
nonproperty
owners
are
like
used,
he
encourage
no
peculiar
liability
as
neither
the
property
owner
nor
his
property
is
in
anyway
peculiarly
liable
for
the
service
or
utility
charge
or
for
the
connection
charge.
it's
a
contractual
obligation
in
louisiana
between
the
user
and
the
supplier.
and
thirdly,
if
the
proposition
to
be
voted
on
is
economically
sound
and
this
would
result
in
an
increase
in
revenue
over
and
above
the
bond
repayment
funds
going
into
the
general
city
coffers
so
to
speak,
this
is
beneficial
to
all
taxpayers
and
all
residents
of
the
city
of
houma.
if
on
the
other
hand,
the
proposition
will
approve
economically
unsound
resulting
in
less
money
going
into
the
general
fund,
this
would
adversely
affect
all
citizens
as
additional
tax
money
may
be
necessary
to
run
the
city.
since
over
90%
of
the
total
money
generated
as
revenues
for
the
city
of
houma
well
over
90%
come
from
sources
other
than
property
taxes,
we
maintain
that
the
greater
interest
lies
with
that
group
or
classification
who
pays
more
than
90%
of
the
funds
into
the
general
treasury
of
the
city
and
this
would
be
the
general
electorate
and
the
general
citizenry
of
the
city
of
houma.
the
property
owner,
a
review
of
the
stipulation
of
facts
at
page
19
and
20
of
the
single
appendix,
paragraphs
7
and
8,
together
with
the
official
audit
of
the
city
of
houma.
now
the
official
annual
audit
of
the
city
of
houma
for
the
year
ending
september
30,
1968
shows
the
gross
revenues
of
the
city
and
this
official
audit
of
course
covers
the
period
of
this
election
which
was
october
1967
through
that
same
period
in
1968.
when
these
two
items
are
combined
and
analyzed,
it
shows
that
property
owners
pay
substantially
less
than
10%
of
the
total
revenues
of
the
city.
we
believe
that
the
case
of
harper
versus
virginia
state
board
of
elections
is
controlling
in
this
instance.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
i
don't
believe
it's
necessary
for
me
to
go
that
far,
your
honor,
in
the
sense
that
we
can
show
here
that
there
is
absolutely
no
relevancy
and
no
possibility
of
attacks
being
used.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
they
may
be
your
honor
to
both.
but
in
the
harper
case,
this
court
was
consigned
with
the
requirement
of
the
payment
of
the
poll
taxes
of
qualification
to
vote.
in
this
case,
we
are
concerned
with
the
requirement
of
the
payment
of
a
property
tax
as
a
qualification
to
vote.
in
the
harper
case,
this
court
declared
that
voter
qualification
has
no
relation
to
wealth
nor
to
the
paying
or
not
paying
of
this
or
any
other
tax.
in
fact,
we
maintain
that
the
present
case
presents
to
this
court
an
easier
question
than
did
harper.
now
the
dissenting
justices
in
harper
suggested
that
the
state
of
virginia
may
have
had
a
valid
interest
in
the
poll
tax
either
in
deciding
to
collect
additional
revenue
or
in
believing
that
the
voters
who
pay
the
poll
tax
comprise
a
group
which
may
have
been
more
interested
in
the
general
welfare
of
the
state.
under
the
facts
of
the
present
case,
neither
of
these
contentions
can
be
taken
seriously
here.
as
i
have
illustrated
the
property
owning
taxpayer
has
no
interests
in
the
outcome
of
the
revenue
bond
election
greater
than
any
other
voter.
in
fact,
as
a
group,
they
have
decided
a
less
interest
as
they
pay
less
than
10%
of
the
total
revenues
of
the
city
of
houma.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
sir?
mr.
kenneth
watkins
no
sir,
your
honor.
we
have
filed
our
suit
within
the
60-day
statutory
provision
allowed
by
louisiana
law
to
challenge
such
an
election
and
so
actually
no
rights
have
become
vested
in
this
case
nor
have
any
bonds
been
sold
or
nor
has
the
question
become
final.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
well,
without
wishing
to
presuppose
any
judgment
which
the
court
may
run,
i
will
suggest
as
we
have
in
our
reply
memorandum
your
honor
that
if
this
court
were
to
agree
with
us
that
it
may
limit,
if
you
will.
it
may
first
of
all
grant
us
the
relief
we
pray
for,
for
this
class
action
and
that
no
rights
have
become
vested
here
nor
have
any
bonds
issued
nor
had
the
matter
become
final.
we
suggested
in
our
reply
brief
that
the
court
may
limit
the
retrospective
effect
of
its
decision
to
those
cases
where
rights
have
not
become
final
or
where
bonds
have
not
been
issued
as
an
example,
i
think
we
may
have
pointed
out
your
honor.
if
the
election
had
actually
been
held
then
full
time
for
challenge
had
passed
and
the
local
authority
may
have
been
gone
on
planning
as
they
must
pre-plan,
we
appreciate
that,
there
would
be
no
manifest
ill
or
no
adverse
effect
by
allowing
that
one
to
stand
since
the
time
for
challenging
had
passed.
obviously,
where
bonds
have
been
issued
the
same
rule
would
apply,
rights
have
become
vested.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
i
think
the
court
clearly
has
the
authority
to
give
its
decision
to
that
effect.
we
have
--
they
can
grant
us
the
relief
prayed
for
us.
no
rights
have
become
vested
nor
the
matter
was
not
finalized
and
the
court
could
limit
the
effect
of
its
decision
to
those
cases
where
rights
have
not
become
vested
and
where
it
has
not
become
final.
i
may
point
out
--
mr.
kenneth
watkins
sir?
mr.
kenneth
watkins
yes,
your
honor.
i
appreciate
that
and
i
can
sincerely
differentiate
between
the
dire
consequences
the
court
might
have
encountered
in
saying
that
we
will
wholly
completely
legislate
your
ill
apportion
and
therefore
acts
passed
are
invalid.
rights
may
have
become
vested.
the
court
has
an
obligation
to
preserve
order
and
i
think
this
was
to
a
large
extent
the
court's
concern
preserving
the
due
process
of
order,
so
to
speak.
in
this
case
this
does
not
occur
your
honor.
no
rights
have
become
vested
in
this
instance.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
well,
where
the
elections
--
mr.
kenneth
watkins
where
the
bonds
have
been
issued
as
we
have
spoken
with
mr.
justice
fortas.
where
bonds
have
been
issued,
rights
have
become
final
and
vested.
and
we
see
no
difficulty
in
the
court
limiting
the
effect
of
its
decision,
clearly,
to
those
cases
where
rights
have
not
become
vested
such
as
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
i'm
sorry
sir?
mr.
kenneth
watkins
i'm
not
sure
your
honor
that
at
which
time
you
may
have
to
do
it.
this
is
one
suggestion
only
of
the
way
in
which
you
may
do
it
in
keeping
what
we
consider
the
ruling
of
this
court
in
the
mapp
and
linkletter
decisions.
it's
an
analogy
to
the
application
of
this
court
of
the
mapp
decision
and
the
linkletter
case.
we
may
additionally
point
out
in
this
case,
your
honor
that
not
only
is
the
qualification
of
paying
a
tax
violative
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
set
forth
in
the
harper
case
but
the
--
the
qualification
of
wealth
is
given
added
emphasis.
in
this
case,
the
property
tax
presupposes
the
ownership
of
property
in
addition
to
the
payment
of
this
tax
and
the
degree
of
wealth
is
even
made
a
factor
in
the
present
case
by
the
statutory
requirement
that
the
proposition
be
voted
favorably
upon
by
a
majority
in
number
of
voters
and
a
majority
in
the
assessed
evaluation
of
the
property
owned
by
the
voters.
therefore,
the
wealthier
vote
is
given
a
weighted
effect.
the
wealthier
man
has
a
weightier
vote.
it
is
appellant's
decision
--
mr.
kenneth
watkins
that
is
correct
sir
but
if
this
rich
man
owns
real
estate,
he
is
given
a
weighted
vote.
the
court
below
surmised
some
possible
rational
purpose
for
the
limitation
and
we
submit
that
absolutely
non-exist
for
the
three
reasons
that
we
have
previously
given
this
court.
appellees
have
previously
advanced
the
purpose
that
advance
the
suggestion
that
the
legislative
purpose
for
the
distinction
in
this
voter
classification
was
and
i
quote,
“the
desire
to
place
a
check
upon
borrowing
by
governmental
units
at
page
5
of
the
trial
brief.”
we
submit
that
if
that
classification
was
permissible,
it
has
no
relevance
or
whatsoever
to
the
purpose
of
this
legislation.
to
the
contrary,
the
total
absence
of
liability
peculiar
to
the
taxpayer
or
to
his
property
effectively
invites
him
to
vote
with
more
or
less
unrestrained
enthusiasm.
exhibits
p1
through
p7
clearly
show
that
the
proponents
of
the
bond
issued
constantly
advice
the
taxpayers
that
a
favorable
vote
would
protect
his
low
property
tax
rate
and
no
new
taxes
could
be
added.
in
the
present
case,
all
citizens
have
an
equal
proprietary
interest
in
revenues,
equal
proprietary
interest
in
city
owned
properties.
all
citizens
pay
taxes
into
the
general
fund
as
we
have
shown
a
comparison
of
the
1968
audit
of
the
fiscal
year
ending
september
30,
1968
together
with
the
stipulation
of
fact
shows
that
well
over
90%
of
the
revenues
are
paid
by
the
general
electorate
of
the
general
citizenry.
now,
we
maintain
that
there's
absolutely
no
justification
your
honor,
for
this
classification
as
set
forth
in
this
particular
statute.
i
may
call
to
this
court's
attention
the
fact
that
a
casual
comparison
if
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
of
the
three
different
sections
of
chapter
10
of
the
title
33
of
the
louisiana
revised
statutes
indicates
that
the
legislature
provided
three
different
methods
for
submitting
the
same
general
proposition
to
the
voters.
subsection
b
provides
for
a
bond
election,
subsection
d
and
subsection
c
--
b,
c,
and
d.
the
city
elected
to
use
subsection
c
and
of
the
three
subsections,
this
is
the
only
one
that
restricts
the
vote
to
property
owners.
strangely
enough,
subsection
b
and
subsection
d
both
dealing
with
the
same
proposition,
both
dealing
with
the
same
authority,
both
pledging
revenues
and
city
properties
owned
by
everybody,
two
sections
allow
everybody
to
vote,
one
section
allows
only
property
owner.
we
submit
that
there
is
absolutely
no
justification
for
the
distinction.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
sir?
mr.
kenneth
watkins
well,
act
33
of
the
special
session
--
mr.
kenneth
watkins
we
maintain
has
no
--
mr.
kenneth
watkins
we
maintain
act
33
of
the
special
section
of
1968
your
honor
has
no
bearing
whatsoever
upon
this
case.
as
we
have
tried
to
point
out
to
the
court
in
our
reply
memorandum,
the
appellees
cite
a
particular
paragraph
as
being
a
paragraph
ratifying
this
election.
number
one,
it
is
very
strange
to
us
that
the
paragraph
which
appellees
claim
ratifies
this
election
never
uses
the
word
ratifies,
confirms,
or
in
any
way
have
sense
to
it.
the
next
paragraph
dealing
with
previously
issued
bonds
which
is
not
the
case
here
does
use
these
words,
ratify
and
confirmed.
your
honor
may
find
the
statute
quoted
at
page
17
of
the
appellees
brief.
i
did
not
reprint
it
as
the
appellees
have
reprinted
the
act
at
page
17
of
his
brief.
we
maintain
that
certainly
it
was
not
the
intention
of
the
legislature
to
ratify
this
election.
secondly,
we
maintain
that
the
legislature
cannot
ratify
action
taken
under
and
unconstitutional
state
act
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
to
do
so,
puts
an
action
of
the
state
legislature
of
louisiana
on
equal
footing
with
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
sir.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
kenneth
watkins
we
agree
with
you
your
honor
that
it
would
not
have
been
necessary
for
the
state
of
louisiana
probably
to
require
an
election
but
under
harper,
once
an
election
is
granted,
once
the
franchise
is
granted,
it
must
be
consistent
with
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
classification
--
mr.
kenneth
watkins
unless,
--
mr.
kenneth
watkins
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
once
the
fourth
--
once
the
election
of
franchise
is
granted
half
of
demands
that
it
be
granted
in
lines
consistent
with
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
may
point
out
this
to
you,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
but
i
point
this
out
to
you
your
honor.
if
you'll
notice
the
language
of
the
statute
itself,
it
says
that
in
the
event
a
property
taxpayer's
election,
i'm
quoting
form
page
18
the
last
paragraph
of
appellee's
brief
where
he
has
set
forth
the
statute,
“in
the
event
a
property
taxpayer's
election
has
heretofore
been
held
and
promulgated
approving
the
issuance
of
the
bonds.”
now,
even
if
we
were
to
conceive
which
we
do
not
that
the
state
of
louisiana
has
the
authority
to
validate
an
unconstitutional
act,
this
act
in
itself
is
unconstitutional.
we
maintain
and
that
it
recognizes
the
unfair
advantage
given
to
the
property
owner
because
this
paragraph
requires
that
you
have
had
an
election
and
obviously
you
must
have
had
it
under
this
present
statute
the
city
has
chosen
subpart
c.
and
if
you
have
had
an
election,
it
must
have
passed.
so
this
paragraph
recognizes
the
discrimination
and
requiring
a
previous
election
and
that
it
have
been
passed.
you
could
not
do
it,
according
to
this
paragraph,
if
the
city
of
houma
have
had
an
election
and
the
bonds
have
been
voted
down,
this
paragraph
would
not
be
applicable.
and
we
maintain
even
to
the
extent
that
they
recognize
the
discrimination
of
the
present
statute
in
this
act,
this
act
itself
would
not
be
applicable
even
if
they
had
the
power
to
do
it
which
we
deny.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
that
is
correct,
sir.
if
your
honor
please,
i'd
like
to
save
the
remaining
part
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
thank
you.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
only
a
few
comments
i
think
i
would
like
to
make
with
respect
to
mr.
huppenbauer's
arguments.
number
one,
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
that
these
bonds
we're
talking
about
in
this
case
are
not
general
obligation
bonds
contrary
to
the
statistics
mr.
huppenbauer
referred
to
in
the
amicus
brief.
although
it
didn't
reflect
it
here,
the
statistics
in
the
amicus
brief
are
somewhat
misleading
and
that
that
the
real
gem
of
this
is
that
no
general
obligations
bonds
are
here,
no
tax
money
can
be
used,
and
that
the
statistics
showed
in
the
amicus
brief
failed
to
clearly
set
forth
the
number
of
states
where
the
general
obligation
bonds
are
not
in
effect.
we
believe
there
are
only
three
states
in
the
union
as
far
as
we
can
ascertain
from
our
research:
louisiana,
texas
and
idaho
that
had
any
requirement
even
similar
to
this
with
a
non-general
obligation
bond
in
question.
with
regard
to
the
--
mr.
huppenbauer's
argument
on
the
specter
of
confusion,
gentlemen,
it
simply
does
not
exist.
the
state
law
can
be
made
applicable
as
this
court
did
in
linkletter.
whenever
the
state
law
determines
finality
to
an
issue
and
at
the
time
under
state
law
has
passed
to
challenge
that
issue,
this
is
an
easy
break
off
point,
should
the
court
decide
to
use
it
so
to
speak.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
in
this
case,
the
questions
have
not
become
from
final.
vested
rights
have
not
come
into
play.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
no,
sir
i
can't
offhand
tell
you
that
your
honor.
i'd
be
glad
to
have
that
matter
checked
and
submitted
to
the
court
if
the
court
would
feel
that
it
would
want
it
but
i
cannot
--
i'm
not
prepared
to
give
the
court
that
statement
of
fact
as
to
the
number
of
states
that
required
in
months
instead
of
years.
i
would
certainly
assume
however
as
mr.
huppenbauer
has
actually
argued
that
every
state
has
some
period.
at
some
point,
you
have
to
have
your
finality
for
somebody
to
buy
the
bond.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
i
would
only
suggest
that
--
mr.
kenneth
watkins
i
would
only
suggest
that
the
question
of
years
is
an
old
probability
not
in
play
here
your
honor,
as
who
would
want
to
wait
years
before
they
can
sell
a
bond.
and
i'm
sure
nobody
would
want
to
buy
a
bond
where
the
right
matter
had
not
become
final
as
mr.
huppenbauer
had
suggested.
they
have
to
have
an
opinion
from
a
competent
bond
attorney
and
this
competent
bond
attorney
is
much
certainly
certified
that
at
the
time
the
challenge
has
passed
and
i'm
sure
no
issuing
authority
would
want
to
wait
several
years
before
they
issue
the
bonds
so
they
must
be
one.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
a
town
of
about
35,000
people
now,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
i
would
estimate
that,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
well,
the
question
is
this
your
honor,
if
we
go
into
that
phase
of
it,
not
necessarily
a
question
of
revenue
at
stake
but
as
we
discussed
earlier,
this
is
a
question
of
possibly
using
revenue
in
lieu
of
taxes
and
not
giving
the
majority
of
people
a
right
to
vote
on
it.
mr.
kenneth
watkins
well
the
real
interest
of
that
company,
i
couldn't
say
mrs.
cipriano
does
work
for
him
but
we
do
have
6,000
other
plaintiffs,
this
is
a
class
action.
thank
you,
your
honor.
