mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
really
only
two
issues
that
this
court
need
consider
itself
within
this
case.
of
course,
there
is
the
constitutional
issue
and
i
think
more
importantly
is
the
effect
of
a
decision
of
this
court
which
may
invalidate
the
procedure
under
which
this
bond
election
was
held.
you
will
note
in
the
brief
filed
by
the
intervenor
state
of
louisiana
and
the
louisiana
municipal
association
that
there
are
14
states
in
united
states
which
have
similar
voting
requirement
statutes.
in
every
instance,
of
course,
this
requirement
is
applicable
to
general
obligation
bonds
and
in
most
instances,
a
property
taxpayer
election
is
likewise
required
on
the
revenue
issue.
now,
before
i
discuss
whether
or
not
the
relief
or
the
decision
of
the
court
should
be
prospective
or
retrospective,
certainly
there
will
be
serious
nationwide
consequences
to
municipal
securities
if
the
retroactivity
of
this
decision
goes
back
totally
or
even
partially.
nevertheless,
there
are
few
relevant
facts
which
i
think
this
court
should
be
apprised
of
and
one
deals
with
the
statistics
set
forth
in
the
factual
situation
before
the
court.
appellant
contends
that
there
are
11,600
registered
voters
but
there
are
only
4,680
registered
property
taxpayer
voters.
this
4,600
was
taken
from
the
assessment
rolls
and
the
registrar's
office.
now,
louisiana
is
a
community
property
state.
property
may
be
assessed
and
in
most
instances
is
assessed
in
the
name
of
a
husband.
but
the
wife
is
likewise
entitled
to
vote.
she
will
show
not
up
as
a
property
taxpayer
voter
on
the
assessment
roll.
therefore,
the
argument
that
there
are
6,900
people
eligible
to
vote
who
could
not
vote
is
substantially
diluted
by
the
spouses
of
those
registered
property
taxpayers.
and
likewise
in
many
instances
where
property
was
owned
by
a
parent
who
is
now
deceased
where
the
state
have
not
been
probated
through
the
courts,
the
property
is
still
assessed
in
the
(inaudible)
name.
if
they
left
six
or
seven
children,
all
six
or
seven
would
be
entitled
to
vote.
so,
we
submit
that
the
statistics
are
not
wholly
correct.
there
was
no
way
which
correct
whole
legitimate
statistics
could
be
provided
in
this
case.
furthermore,
this
plaintiff,
this
appellant
brought
this
action
to
enjoin
the
election
and
also
the
issuance
of
the
bonds.
now,
he
brought
the
action
some
55
days
after
the
election
was
held.
the
record
clearly
shows
the
appellant
is
the
district
manager
of
a
private
utility
operating
in
this
area.
he
said
that
he
did
not
vote
because
he
felt
like
the
election
would
be
defeated.
we
go
back
to
the
same
antagonism
here
of
public
versus
private
power.
no
other
individual
has
joined
this
class
action
other
than
this
particular
plaintiff.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
this
is
purely
for
expansion.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
not
to
create
it,
correct.
the
provisions
of
the
law
require
many
things.
the
vote
here
is
only
one
administrative
incidental
factor.
number
one,
the
city
government
must
decide
whether
or
not
the
utility
system
needs
expansion.
number
two,
it
must
make
application
to
a
state
board
separately
for
permission
to
issue
the
bond.
number
three,
it
then
must
submit
the
issue
to
the
voter
who
has
a
veto
power
we
admit.
but
he
also
has
only
one
segment
of
this
deal.
if
it
is
approved
in
these
three
procedures,
then
the
city
government
on
its
own
by
purely
affirmative
action
must
then
issue
the
bonds.
appellant
relies
heavily
on
the,
what
he
call
the
60-day
prescriptive
period
for
vesting
certain
rights
in
person
to
challenge
the
election.
this
statute
has
a
60-day
prescriptive
period
after
the
election.
it
likewise
has
a
30-day
prescriptive
period
after
the
issuance
and
sale
of
bonds.
in
the
municipal
securities,
there
is
really
no
vested
right
in
anyone
until
the
bonds
are
actually
sold
and
deliver.
at
any
time,
bonds
can
be
challenged.
municipal
securities
are
not
governed
by
any
federal
regulation.
congress
saw
fit
to
exclude
it
from
the
sec
control.
therefore,
there
is
a
complex
system
of
checks
and
balances
in
the
issuance
of
these
securities.
these
securities
are
governed
by
state
constitution,
state
laws.
also,
you'll
find
that
a
deal
will
not
buy
security
unless
an
approvingly
legal
opinion
by
a
competent
nationally
recognized
bond
attorney
follow
the
opinion.
all
of
this
act
as
checks
and
balances
as
constitutional
limit
in
debt
amount
and
limit
interest
rates.
the
vote
limits
expansions.
the
marketplace
actually
limits
the
sale
and
delivery
of
securities.
in
this
instance,
if
these
bonds
are
to
be
issued
they
certainly
cannot
be
issued
indiscriminately.
the
city
already
has
the
utility
system.
it
has
million
of
bonds
outstanding
against
this
system.
unless
the
system
can
prove
itself
to
pay
additional
bond,
that
comply
with
many
covenants
and
restrictions
imposed
upon
the
city
on
bonds
already
issued,
then
there
they
cannot
be
a
second
bond
issue.
there
are
all
these
facet
concerned.
we
feel
that
the
election
here
is
purely
an
administrative
function.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
we
consider
it
outside
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
believe
that
the
analogy
of
this
court
--
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
we
feel
like,
in
view
of
the
decision
of
harper
which
states
only
invidious
discrimination
or
arbitrary
discrimination
is
repugnant
to
the
federal
constitution
where
the
states
are
still
permitted
to
classify.
it
has
not
disallowed
states
from
continuing
with
the
classifying
voting.
in
avery
versus
midland
county,
this
court
--
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
this
does
not
violate
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
it
could
be
applied.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
it
had
to
be
but
then
we
feel
that
there
had
been
no
violation.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
yes,
we
have
to
comply
with
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
we
feel
in
this
instance
it
is
because
we're
not
voting
on
an
essential
governmental
purpose.
we
are
not
electing
officials
to
govern.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
this
is
a
private
business
of
the
city.
actually
it's
a
quasi
private
business.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
correct
sir.
although
--
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
it's
--
no,
it's
public
but
it's
a
quasi.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
correct,
sir.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
harper
says
you
cannot
discriminate
invidiously.
you
cannot
discriminate
arbitrarily
in
your
classification.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
correct
but
that
was
a
dollar
--
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
i'm
not
aware
of
that,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
but
the
tax
here
does
not
go
to
the
qualification
of
voting,
the
tax
here
is
a
revenue
producing
tax
that
goes
to
the
benefit
of
the
city.
we
feel
that
the
interest
of
the
voter
should
be
distinguished
from
his
affluence
and
his
competence.
in
avery
versus
midland,
this
court
reaffirms
this
distinction
in
the
equal
one
man,
one
vote
rule
and
applied,
still
upheld
the
doctrine
of
sailors
versus
board
of
education
as
against
the
reynolds
case.
the
other
distinguished
between
administrative
functions
versus
legislative
and
actual
governmental
function.
this
is
purely
a
quasi
corporate.
this
is
a
propriety
interest
of
the
city
in
an
operation
of
utility
system
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
general
government
function.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
very
definitely.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
not
necessarily.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
to
the
extent
that
there
may
be
surplus
derive
from
the
operation
and
utilities
that
could
possibly
be
so.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
that's
correct
in
this
instance.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
no,
because
we
feel
like
this
is
not
within
the
purview
of
harper.
because
of
the
--
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
harper
meant
money
but
the
money
went
to
the
--
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
sir?
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
here
is
only
a
veto
power
of
a
segment
of
the
community
which
we
feel
has
a
very
peculiar
and
pecuniary
interests
in
the
utility
system,
rather
than
the
general
public
itself.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
all
citizens
pay
for
the
utilities.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
the
tenant
or
the
landlord
depending
upon
the
lease
--
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
in
most
instances,
i
would
be
sure
that
the
tenant
must
pay
for
the
--
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
but
the
rates
are
fixed
by
the
government
itself,
the
elected
officials.
the
bond
issue
in
most
instances
will
not
affect
the
rates.
therefore,
the
man
without
property
is
not
concerned
about
rates
and
the
bond
election.
if
he
is
concerned
about
the
rates,
then
he
can
vote
for
a
new
official
at
the
next
election
to
justify
the
rates
which
may
be
imposed
upon
the
community.
we
feel
the
harper
case
is
not
wholly
solid
in
its
declaration
that
there
cannot
be
classification
and
we
think
that
the
classification
can
be
made
provided
it
is
not
arbitrary
and
invidiously
discriminatory.
we
feel
like
the
election
here
was
purely
an
administrative
function
coupled
with
the
other
approvals
necessary.
now,
notwithstanding
--
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
that
certainly
would
probably
one
of
their
desires
but
still
the
--
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
i
don't
believe
your
honor.
the
provision
is
here.
what
i'm
sure
that
legislature
tried
to
do
is
maintain
the
consistency
in
voting
on
bond
issue.
i
think
we
all
must
agree
that
the
taxpayer
certainly
has
the
paramount
interest
in
the
general
obligation
bond.
similarly,
we
argue
that
the
interest
here
is
more
predominant
in
the
taxpayer
because
he
has
to
have
utility
of
the
service
property
to
make
it
valuable
or
saleable.
if
--
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
correct.
everybody
pays
for
it.
but
the
rates
fixed
or
by
the
elected
officials
not
by
the
taxpayer
himself.
the
rates
are
fixed
by
elected
officials.
now,
politically
elected
officials
are
very
cognizant
of
rates
if
they
fix
rates
too
high
discriminating
against
one
class
of
citizens,
they
are
certainly
susceptible
of
being
thrown
out
of
office.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
they're
very
cognizant
to
tax
rates.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
but
we
can
extend
this
doctrine
to
a
point
where
why
not
have
a
corporation
permissible
to
vote?
why
not
have
the
non-resident
taxpayer
who
may
live
in
another
state
of
another
county,
who
may
own
substantial
land
interest.
he's
not
entitled
to
both.
they're
all
kinds
of
stages
of
classification
and
in
this
instance
the
state
has
saw
fit
to
maintain
a
consistent
classification
for
the
general
obligation
bond
and
the
revenue
bond
because
we
feel
there
is
a
peculiar
interest
vested
in
the
property
only
here
rather
than
the
entire
community.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
we
are
not
really
concerned
with
rates
here
your
honor.
we're
concerned
with
the
service
to
a
piece
of
land
for
water
or
gas
or
electricity.
now
rates,
we
realize
are
indirectly
affected
by
bonds
but
the
rates
are
not
that
established
by
the
voters,
they
are
established
by
the
elected
officials.
and
it
is
separate
and
apart.
the
rates
separate
and
apart
from
the
expansion
or
the
improvement
of
the
facilities
to
landed
areas
within
the
community.
i
realize
there
are
some
tie-in
but
it
is
not
a
direct
affect.
there
is
some
distinction.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
it
operates
--
there
is
a
segment
of
that
utility
company
very
definitely
operating
in
the
city.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
the
city
has
an
electric
system.
i'd
say
it
comprises
about
80
to
90%
of
the
city.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
correct,
your
honor.
but
it
also
was
intended
to
complete
a
project
that
was
voted
and
approved
in
1965
and
this
where
the
effect
of
prospective
or
retrospective
effect
becomes
very
important.
in
this
instance,
the
city
had
a
bond
issue
in
1965.
they
have
sold
two
segments
of
that
issue.
there's
about
$2
million
left
out
of
that
issue
which
should
involve
in
this
instance.
they
have
committed
themselves
to
long
term
contracts
with
westinghouse,
general
electric
to
buy
generating
capacity.
this
money
is
needed
to
house
and
to
extend
the
lines
from
the
generating
unit.
it's
all
tied
into
a
long
range
program.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
the
louisiana
power
and
light
company
took
an
active
role
in
trying
to
defeat
the
elections
by
public
relation
very
definitely.
and
the
litigant
here
is
the
district
manager.
there
is
also
a
separate
suit
filed
in
the
district
court
in
the
state
by
the
right
of
way
of
managing
the
power
company
so
--
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
he
is
definitely
a
qualified
voter.
yes,
sir.
the
issue
of
prospective
or
retrospective
effect
here
i
think
is
very
important
not
only
to
louisiana
but
to
the
other
13
states
which
have
similar
type
of
a
voting
procedures.
this
court
has
in
the
reapportionment
case
use
the
prospective
effect
where
they
found
inequities
to
exist
where
there
would
be
dire
circumstances
which
would
arise
to
vested
interest.
now,
there
are
millions
and
billions
of
dollars
of
bonds
outstanding
by
not
only
louisiana
and
the
other
states
but
many
municipalities
which
have
either
voted
and
sold
all
the
bonds,
bonds
have
been
delivered.
there
are
many
instances
where
bonds
have
been
voted
but
the
complete
issue
had
not
yet
been
delivered.
if
you
make
your
decision
retrospectively
even
to
the
date
of
say
the
houma
election,
you're
going
to
cutoff
many
bonds
that
have
been
previously
authorized
but
not
yet
issued.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
act
33,
is
that
what
you've
--
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
the
act
33
which
was
enacted
by
the
louisiana
legislature
became
effective
in
january
this
year.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
i
think
that
is
the
effect
of
validating
--
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
i
think
this
act
was
purely
a
state
question.
there's
no
--
there's
no
constitutional
requirement
in
louisiana
that
election
be
held
at
all.
there
is
no
federal
constitution
requirement
here
that
an
election
be
held.
if
the
state
had
no
election
procedure,
it
certainly
i
believe
could
issue
the
bond
by
purely
the
governmental
agency
itself.
the
legislature
saw
fit
to
protect
the
vested
interest
of
these
municipalities
that
have
extended
contract,
that
have
bonds
voted
but
not
yet
issued
to
allow
them
to
continue
to
do
so.
it
so
extends
i
believe
to
this
particular
case
because
the
city
of
houma
did
hold
the
election.
it
was
properly
promulgated
under
the
authority
than
existing
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
this
act
went
into
effect
in
january
and
i
feel
that
it
definite
had
a
definite
effect.
they
would
certainly
meant
to
include
this
particular
case.
this
bond
election
was
held.
the
legislature
said
in
effect,
if
you
had
an
election,
no
matter
what
procedure
you
have,
you
do
not
have
to
have
in
other
election.
you
can
go
ahead
and
issue
those
bonds.
now,
hereafter
you
have
two
procedures
to
follow.
in
the
anticipation
perhaps
that
this
court
may
nullify
the
procedures
already
they
then
adopt
a
double
system
now.
the
municipality
can
continue
under
the
same
system
or
you
can
go
to
a
general
election
where
all
property
taxpayers,
all
registered
voters
are
eligible
to
vote.
this
however
acts
prospectively.
the
act
i
think
attempted
to
cure
and
permit
the
issuance
of
all
bonds
which
have
been
previously
voted.
the
same
effect
i
think,
a
decision
by
this
court
if
it
were
retroactive
would
affect
all
of
the
other
states
which
had
similar
statutory
requirements
or
constitutional
requirements.
in
many
instances,
they
would
leave
projects
which
are
partially
completed
from
financing
or
projects
which
have
been
approved
by
the
voter
for
which
commitments
have
been
made
whereby
the
issuing
authority
or
the
municipality
or
the
political
subdivision
could
not
then
find
the
financing
if
this
decision
is
retrospective
in
any
effect.
we
believe
that
to
avoid
a
calamity
in
the
municipal
market
in
this
country
that
the
fairest
prospective
relief
that
could
be
afforded
this
case
should
the
find
that
this
procedure
is
unconstitutional
is
to
apply
it
solely
to
elections
to
be
called
hereafter
which
would
allow
bonds
to
be
issued
on
elections
previously
conducted
where
many
commitments
have
been
made
by
political
subdivisions.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
that
i
think
is
our
position
wrapped
up
very
beautifully
and
that
rates
are
distinct
from
the
bond
issue
here.
the
expansion
or
development
affects
more
directly
the
landowner
if
the
user
himself
as
well
as
the
property
owner
who
is
also
a
user
is
dissatisfied
with
his
rates,
he
then
has
the
right
to
elect
new
city
officials
who
themselves
alone
have
a
right
to
fix
this.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
i
agree
sir.
it's
the
--
i
think
a
good
wrap-up
of
the
argument
that
we
feel
here,
there
is
a
justification
for
a
classification
in
this
particular
instance
because
this
is
not
an
essential
government
purpose,
this
is
purely
one
which
involves
an
administrative
function
of
the
government,
a
quasi-corporate
operation.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
i
think
the
greater
interest
definitely
in
the
general
obligation
bond
is
predominantly
in
the
taxpayer.
but
we
feel,
in
view
of
the
statement
that
justice
fortas
just
indicated
there
is
more
of
an
interest
in
the
landowner
to
see
that
property
of
developed
utility
service
is
extended.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
this
bond
issue
only
pledges
the
revenue
derived
from
the
operation
of
the
utility
system.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
that's
all.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
the
surplus
which
may
be
derived
--
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
--
will
flow
into
the
general
fund
if
there
is
a
service
and
--
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
well,
i
think
you
can
because
the
city,
there
are
many
types
of
reserve
payments,
reserve
funds
that
must
be
established
in
issuing
this
bond.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
you
can
go
that
far.
i
think
you
could
--
you
definitely
must
say
that
where
the
bonds
have
to
be
payable
for
--
from
ad
valorem
taxation
on
property
that
certainly
the
vested
or
the
paramount
interest
is
in
that
property
owner.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
to
the
exclusion
of
all
others,
correct.
we're
in
the
gray
area
--
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
no
cases
whatsoever.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
we
have
harper
which
says
that
you,
you
can
still
classify
but
not
arbitrarily
or
discriminatorily.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
but
justice
--
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
but
justice
marshall,
the
harper
case
was
really
concerned
with
the
election
of
political
officials.
every
case
relied
upon
in
harper,
dealt
with
that
not
an
administrative
function.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
i
realize
the
language
is
quite
strong.
but
you
have
the
sailors
case
involving
the
one
man,
on
vote
rule
which
has
made
a
distinction.
this
court
--
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
perhaps
so
but
this
court
in
avery
just
last
term
recognized
again
the
distinction
of
voting
requirements
on
administrative
purposes
rather
than
purely
total
governmental
function.
notwithstanding
the
decision
of
the
court
to
all
bond
issues
or
whether
it
be
retrospective
or
prospective,
we
feel
that
since
there
is
no
constitutional
requirement
either
state
or
federal,
that
the
louisiana
legislative
had
a
right
and
did
in
fact
validate
the
issuance
of
these
bonds
at
issue
in
this
instance.
we
submit
therefore
that
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
really
only
two
issues
that
this
court
need
consider
itself
within
this
case.
of
course,
there
is
the
constitutional
issue
and
i
think
more
importantly
is
the
effect
of
a
decision
of
this
court
which
may
invalidate
the
procedure
under
which
this
bond
election
was
held.
you
will
note
in
the
brief
filed
by
the
intervenor
state
of
louisiana
and
the
louisiana
municipal
association
that
there
are
14
states
in
united
states
which
have
similar
voting
requirement
statutes.
in
every
instance,
of
course,
this
requirement
is
applicable
to
general
obligation
bonds
and
in
most
instances,
a
property
taxpayer
election
is
likewise
required
on
the
revenue
issue.
now,
before
i
discuss
whether
or
not
the
relief
or
the
decision
of
the
court
should
be
prospective
or
retrospective,
certainly
there
will
be
serious
nationwide
consequences
to
municipal
securities
if
the
retroactivity
of
this
decision
goes
back
totally
or
even
partially.
nevertheless,
there
are
few
relevant
facts
which
i
think
this
court
should
be
apprised
of
and
one
deals
with
the
statistics
set
forth
in
the
factual
situation
before
the
court.
appellant
contends
that
there
are
11,600
registered
voters
but
there
are
only
4,680
registered
property
taxpayer
voters.
this
4,600
was
taken
from
the
assessment
rolls
and
the
registrar's
office.
now,
louisiana
is
a
community
property
state.
property
may
be
assessed
and
in
most
instances
is
assessed
in
the
name
of
a
husband.
but
the
wife
is
likewise
entitled
to
vote.
she
will
show
not
up
as
a
property
taxpayer
voter
on
the
assessment
roll.
therefore,
the
argument
that
there
are
6,900
people
eligible
to
vote
who
could
not
vote
is
substantially
diluted
by
the
spouses
of
those
registered
property
taxpayers.
and
likewise
in
many
instances
where
property
was
owned
by
a
parent
who
is
now
deceased
where
the
state
have
not
been
probated
through
the
courts,
the
property
is
still
assessed
in
the
(inaudible)
name.
if
they
left
six
or
seven
children,
all
six
or
seven
would
be
entitled
to
vote.
so,
we
submit
that
the
statistics
are
not
wholly
correct.
there
was
no
way
which
correct
whole
legitimate
statistics
could
be
provided
in
this
case.
furthermore,
this
plaintiff,
this
appellant
brought
this
action
to
enjoin
the
election
and
also
the
issuance
of
the
bonds.
now,
he
brought
the
action
some
55
days
after
the
election
was
held.
the
record
clearly
shows
the
appellant
is
the
district
manager
of
a
private
utility
operating
in
this
area.
he
said
that
he
did
not
vote
because
he
felt
like
the
election
would
be
defeated.
we
go
back
to
the
same
antagonism
here
of
public
versus
private
power.
no
other
individual
has
joined
this
class
action
other
than
this
particular
plaintiff.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
this
is
purely
for
expansion.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
not
to
create
it,
correct.
the
provisions
of
the
law
require
many
things.
the
vote
here
is
only
one
administrative
incidental
factor.
number
one,
the
city
government
must
decide
whether
or
not
the
utility
system
needs
expansion.
number
two,
it
must
make
application
to
a
state
board
separately
for
permission
to
issue
the
bond.
number
three,
it
then
must
submit
the
issue
to
the
voter
who
has
a
veto
power
we
admit.
but
he
also
has
only
one
segment
of
this
deal.
if
it
is
approved
in
these
three
procedures,
then
the
city
government
on
its
own
by
purely
affirmative
action
must
then
issue
the
bonds.
appellant
relies
heavily
on
the,
what
he
call
the
60-day
prescriptive
period
for
vesting
certain
rights
in
person
to
challenge
the
election.
this
statute
has
a
60-day
prescriptive
period
after
the
election.
it
likewise
has
a
30-day
prescriptive
period
after
the
issuance
and
sale
of
bonds.
in
the
municipal
securities,
there
is
really
no
vested
right
in
anyone
until
the
bonds
are
actually
sold
and
deliver.
at
any
time,
bonds
can
be
challenged.
municipal
securities
are
not
governed
by
any
federal
regulation.
congress
saw
fit
to
exclude
it
from
the
sec
control.
therefore,
there
is
a
complex
system
of
checks
and
balances
in
the
issuance
of
these
securities.
these
securities
are
governed
by
state
constitution,
state
laws.
also,
you'll
find
that
a
deal
will
not
buy
security
unless
an
approvingly
legal
opinion
by
a
competent
nationally
recognized
bond
attorney
follow
the
opinion.
all
of
this
act
as
checks
and
balances
as
constitutional
limit
in
debt
amount
and
limit
interest
rates.
the
vote
limits
expansions.
the
marketplace
actually
limits
the
sale
and
delivery
of
securities.
in
this
instance,
if
these
bonds
are
to
be
issued
they
certainly
cannot
be
issued
indiscriminately.
the
city
already
has
the
utility
system.
it
has
million
of
bonds
outstanding
against
this
system.
unless
the
system
can
prove
itself
to
pay
additional
bond,
that
comply
with
many
covenants
and
restrictions
imposed
upon
the
city
on
bonds
already
issued,
then
there
they
cannot
be
a
second
bond
issue.
there
are
all
these
facet
concerned.
we
feel
that
the
election
here
is
purely
an
administrative
function.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
we
consider
it
outside
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
believe
that
the
analogy
of
this
court
--
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
we
feel
like,
in
view
of
the
decision
of
harper
which
states
only
invidious
discrimination
or
arbitrary
discrimination
is
repugnant
to
the
federal
constitution
where
the
states
are
still
permitted
to
classify.
it
has
not
disallowed
states
from
continuing
with
the
classifying
voting.
in
avery
versus
midland
county,
this
court
--
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
this
does
not
violate
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
it
could
be
applied.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
it
had
to
be
but
then
we
feel
that
there
had
been
no
violation.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
yes,
we
have
to
comply
with
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
we
feel
in
this
instance
it
is
because
we're
not
voting
on
an
essential
governmental
purpose.
we
are
not
electing
officials
to
govern.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
this
is
a
private
business
of
the
city.
actually
it's
a
quasi
private
business.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
correct
sir.
although
--
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
it's
--
no,
it's
public
but
it's
a
quasi.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
correct,
sir.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
harper
says
you
cannot
discriminate
invidiously.
you
cannot
discriminate
arbitrarily
in
your
classification.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
correct
but
that
was
a
dollar
--
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
i'm
not
aware
of
that,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
but
the
tax
here
does
not
go
to
the
qualification
of
voting,
the
tax
here
is
a
revenue
producing
tax
that
goes
to
the
benefit
of
the
city.
we
feel
that
the
interest
of
the
voter
should
be
distinguished
from
his
affluence
and
his
competence.
in
avery
versus
midland,
this
court
reaffirms
this
distinction
in
the
equal
one
man,
one
vote
rule
and
applied,
still
upheld
the
doctrine
of
sailors
versus
board
of
education
as
against
the
reynolds
case.
the
other
distinguished
between
administrative
functions
versus
legislative
and
actual
governmental
function.
this
is
purely
a
quasi
corporate.
this
is
a
propriety
interest
of
the
city
in
an
operation
of
utility
system
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
general
government
function.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
very
definitely.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
not
necessarily.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
to
the
extent
that
there
may
be
surplus
derive
from
the
operation
and
utilities
that
could
possibly
be
so.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
that's
correct
in
this
instance.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
no,
because
we
feel
like
this
is
not
within
the
purview
of
harper.
because
of
the
--
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
harper
meant
money
but
the
money
went
to
the
--
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
sir?
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
here
is
only
a
veto
power
of
a
segment
of
the
community
which
we
feel
has
a
very
peculiar
and
pecuniary
interests
in
the
utility
system,
rather
than
the
general
public
itself.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
all
citizens
pay
for
the
utilities.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
the
tenant
or
the
landlord
depending
upon
the
lease
--
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
in
most
instances,
i
would
be
sure
that
the
tenant
must
pay
for
the
--
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
but
the
rates
are
fixed
by
the
government
itself,
the
elected
officials.
the
bond
issue
in
most
instances
will
not
affect
the
rates.
therefore,
the
man
without
property
is
not
concerned
about
rates
and
the
bond
election.
if
he
is
concerned
about
the
rates,
then
he
can
vote
for
a
new
official
at
the
next
election
to
justify
the
rates
which
may
be
imposed
upon
the
community.
we
feel
the
harper
case
is
not
wholly
solid
in
its
declaration
that
there
cannot
be
classification
and
we
think
that
the
classification
can
be
made
provided
it
is
not
arbitrary
and
invidiously
discriminatory.
we
feel
like
the
election
here
was
purely
an
administrative
function
coupled
with
the
other
approvals
necessary.
now,
notwithstanding
--
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
that
certainly
would
probably
one
of
their
desires
but
still
the
--
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
i
don't
believe
your
honor.
the
provision
is
here.
what
i'm
sure
that
legislature
tried
to
do
is
maintain
the
consistency
in
voting
on
bond
issue.
i
think
we
all
must
agree
that
the
taxpayer
certainly
has
the
paramount
interest
in
the
general
obligation
bond.
similarly,
we
argue
that
the
interest
here
is
more
predominant
in
the
taxpayer
because
he
has
to
have
utility
of
the
service
property
to
make
it
valuable
or
saleable.
if
--
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
correct.
everybody
pays
for
it.
but
the
rates
fixed
or
by
the
elected
officials
not
by
the
taxpayer
himself.
the
rates
are
fixed
by
elected
officials.
now,
politically
elected
officials
are
very
cognizant
of
rates
if
they
fix
rates
too
high
discriminating
against
one
class
of
citizens,
they
are
certainly
susceptible
of
being
thrown
out
of
office.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
they're
very
cognizant
to
tax
rates.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
but
we
can
extend
this
doctrine
to
a
point
where
why
not
have
a
corporation
permissible
to
vote?
why
not
have
the
non-resident
taxpayer
who
may
live
in
another
state
of
another
county,
who
may
own
substantial
land
interest.
he's
not
entitled
to
both.
they're
all
kinds
of
stages
of
classification
and
in
this
instance
the
state
has
saw
fit
to
maintain
a
consistent
classification
for
the
general
obligation
bond
and
the
revenue
bond
because
we
feel
there
is
a
peculiar
interest
vested
in
the
property
only
here
rather
than
the
entire
community.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
we
are
not
really
concerned
with
rates
here
your
honor.
we're
concerned
with
the
service
to
a
piece
of
land
for
water
or
gas
or
electricity.
now
rates,
we
realize
are
indirectly
affected
by
bonds
but
the
rates
are
not
that
established
by
the
voters,
they
are
established
by
the
elected
officials.
and
it
is
separate
and
apart.
the
rates
separate
and
apart
from
the
expansion
or
the
improvement
of
the
facilities
to
landed
areas
within
the
community.
i
realize
there
are
some
tie-in
but
it
is
not
a
direct
affect.
there
is
some
distinction.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
it
operates
--
there
is
a
segment
of
that
utility
company
very
definitely
operating
in
the
city.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
the
city
has
an
electric
system.
i'd
say
it
comprises
about
80
to
90%
of
the
city.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
correct,
your
honor.
but
it
also
was
intended
to
complete
a
project
that
was
voted
and
approved
in
1965
and
this
where
the
effect
of
prospective
or
retrospective
effect
becomes
very
important.
in
this
instance,
the
city
had
a
bond
issue
in
1965.
they
have
sold
two
segments
of
that
issue.
there's
about
$2
million
left
out
of
that
issue
which
should
involve
in
this
instance.
they
have
committed
themselves
to
long
term
contracts
with
westinghouse,
general
electric
to
buy
generating
capacity.
this
money
is
needed
to
house
and
to
extend
the
lines
from
the
generating
unit.
it's
all
tied
into
a
long
range
program.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
the
louisiana
power
and
light
company
took
an
active
role
in
trying
to
defeat
the
elections
by
public
relation
very
definitely.
and
the
litigant
here
is
the
district
manager.
there
is
also
a
separate
suit
filed
in
the
district
court
in
the
state
by
the
right
of
way
of
managing
the
power
company
so
--
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
he
is
definitely
a
qualified
voter.
yes,
sir.
the
issue
of
prospective
or
retrospective
effect
here
i
think
is
very
important
not
only
to
louisiana
but
to
the
other
13
states
which
have
similar
type
of
a
voting
procedures.
this
court
has
in
the
reapportionment
case
use
the
prospective
effect
where
they
found
inequities
to
exist
where
there
would
be
dire
circumstances
which
would
arise
to
vested
interest.
now,
there
are
millions
and
billions
of
dollars
of
bonds
outstanding
by
not
only
louisiana
and
the
other
states
but
many
municipalities
which
have
either
voted
and
sold
all
the
bonds,
bonds
have
been
delivered.
there
are
many
instances
where
bonds
have
been
voted
but
the
complete
issue
had
not
yet
been
delivered.
if
you
make
your
decision
retrospectively
even
to
the
date
of
say
the
houma
election,
you're
going
to
cutoff
many
bonds
that
have
been
previously
authorized
but
not
yet
issued.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
act
33,
is
that
what
you've
--
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
the
act
33
which
was
enacted
by
the
louisiana
legislature
became
effective
in
january
this
year.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
i
think
that
is
the
effect
of
validating
--
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
i
think
this
act
was
purely
a
state
question.
there's
no
--
there's
no
constitutional
requirement
in
louisiana
that
election
be
held
at
all.
there
is
no
federal
constitution
requirement
here
that
an
election
be
held.
if
the
state
had
no
election
procedure,
it
certainly
i
believe
could
issue
the
bond
by
purely
the
governmental
agency
itself.
the
legislature
saw
fit
to
protect
the
vested
interest
of
these
municipalities
that
have
extended
contract,
that
have
bonds
voted
but
not
yet
issued
to
allow
them
to
continue
to
do
so.
it
so
extends
i
believe
to
this
particular
case
because
the
city
of
houma
did
hold
the
election.
it
was
properly
promulgated
under
the
authority
than
existing
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
this
act
went
into
effect
in
january
and
i
feel
that
it
definite
had
a
definite
effect.
they
would
certainly
meant
to
include
this
particular
case.
this
bond
election
was
held.
the
legislature
said
in
effect,
if
you
had
an
election,
no
matter
what
procedure
you
have,
you
do
not
have
to
have
in
other
election.
you
can
go
ahead
and
issue
those
bonds.
now,
hereafter
you
have
two
procedures
to
follow.
in
the
anticipation
perhaps
that
this
court
may
nullify
the
procedures
already
they
then
adopt
a
double
system
now.
the
municipality
can
continue
under
the
same
system
or
you
can
go
to
a
general
election
where
all
property
taxpayers,
all
registered
voters
are
eligible
to
vote.
this
however
acts
prospectively.
the
act
i
think
attempted
to
cure
and
permit
the
issuance
of
all
bonds
which
have
been
previously
voted.
the
same
effect
i
think,
a
decision
by
this
court
if
it
were
retroactive
would
affect
all
of
the
other
states
which
had
similar
statutory
requirements
or
constitutional
requirements.
in
many
instances,
they
would
leave
projects
which
are
partially
completed
from
financing
or
projects
which
have
been
approved
by
the
voter
for
which
commitments
have
been
made
whereby
the
issuing
authority
or
the
municipality
or
the
political
subdivision
could
not
then
find
the
financing
if
this
decision
is
retrospective
in
any
effect.
we
believe
that
to
avoid
a
calamity
in
the
municipal
market
in
this
country
that
the
fairest
prospective
relief
that
could
be
afforded
this
case
should
the
find
that
this
procedure
is
unconstitutional
is
to
apply
it
solely
to
elections
to
be
called
hereafter
which
would
allow
bonds
to
be
issued
on
elections
previously
conducted
where
many
commitments
have
been
made
by
political
subdivisions.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
that
i
think
is
our
position
wrapped
up
very
beautifully
and
that
rates
are
distinct
from
the
bond
issue
here.
the
expansion
or
development
affects
more
directly
the
landowner
if
the
user
himself
as
well
as
the
property
owner
who
is
also
a
user
is
dissatisfied
with
his
rates,
he
then
has
the
right
to
elect
new
city
officials
who
themselves
alone
have
a
right
to
fix
this.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
i
agree
sir.
it's
the
--
i
think
a
good
wrap-up
of
the
argument
that
we
feel
here,
there
is
a
justification
for
a
classification
in
this
particular
instance
because
this
is
not
an
essential
government
purpose,
this
is
purely
one
which
involves
an
administrative
function
of
the
government,
a
quasi-corporate
operation.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
i
think
the
greater
interest
definitely
in
the
general
obligation
bond
is
predominantly
in
the
taxpayer.
but
we
feel,
in
view
of
the
statement
that
justice
fortas
just
indicated
there
is
more
of
an
interest
in
the
landowner
to
see
that
property
of
developed
utility
service
is
extended.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
this
bond
issue
only
pledges
the
revenue
derived
from
the
operation
of
the
utility
system.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
that's
all.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
the
surplus
which
may
be
derived
--
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
--
will
flow
into
the
general
fund
if
there
is
a
service
and
--
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
well,
i
think
you
can
because
the
city,
there
are
many
types
of
reserve
payments,
reserve
funds
that
must
be
established
in
issuing
this
bond.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
you
can
go
that
far.
i
think
you
could
--
you
definitely
must
say
that
where
the
bonds
have
to
be
payable
for
--
from
ad
valorem
taxation
on
property
that
certainly
the
vested
or
the
paramount
interest
is
in
that
property
owner.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
to
the
exclusion
of
all
others,
correct.
we're
in
the
gray
area
--
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
no
cases
whatsoever.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
we
have
harper
which
says
that
you,
you
can
still
classify
but
not
arbitrarily
or
discriminatorily.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
but
justice
--
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
but
justice
marshall,
the
harper
case
was
really
concerned
with
the
election
of
political
officials.
every
case
relied
upon
in
harper,
dealt
with
that
not
an
administrative
function.
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
i
realize
the
language
is
quite
strong.
but
you
have
the
sailors
case
involving
the
one
man,
on
vote
rule
which
has
made
a
distinction.
this
court
--
mr.
eugene
e.
huppenbauer,
jr.
perhaps
so
but
this
court
in
avery
just
last
term
recognized
again
the
distinction
of
voting
requirements
on
administrative
purposes
rather
than
purely
total
governmental
function.
notwithstanding
the
decision
of
the
court
to
all
bond
issues
or
whether
it
be
retrospective
or
prospective,
we
feel
that
since
there
is
no
constitutional
requirement
either
state
or
federal,
that
the
louisiana
legislative
had
a
right
and
did
in
fact
validate
the
issuance
of
these
bonds
at
issue
in
this
instance.
we
submit
therefore
that
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
should
be
affirmed.
