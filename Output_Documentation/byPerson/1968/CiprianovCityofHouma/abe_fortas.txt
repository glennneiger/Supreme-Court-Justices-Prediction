justice
abe
fortas
mr.
harper,
are
these
bonds
been
issued
and
sold?
justice
abe
fortas
have
these
bonds
been
issued
and
sold?
justice
abe
fortas
what
in
your
judgment
--
suppose
we
should
agree
with
you,
what
in
your
judgment
would
be
the
effect
--
might
be
the
effect
of
our
adjudication
upon
outstanding
revenue
bond
issues?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
you
think
that
when
it
comes
to
constitutional
decision
that
we
might
make
could
in
the
first
place
be
made
non-retrospective
and
in
the
second
place
that
would
not
disturb
vested
rights
where
at
least
where
the
time
for
challenge
and
the
state
law
had
passed.
justice
abe
fortas
why
would
it
be
unconstitutional?
justice
abe
fortas
why
would
that
statute
be
unconstitutional?
let
me
put
it
this
way.
suppose
a
state
or
a
municipality
authorized
by
the
state
just
want
to
have
this
tariff
so
long
as
we're
set
up
so
that
the
revenue
bonds
could
be
issued
without
any
vote
at
all.
now,
i
suppose
it's
arguable
that
that
would
not
offend
any
provision
in
the
federal
constitution,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
suppose
that
your
argument
is
that
where
they
do
require
a
vote
that
vote
has
to
be
across
the
boards
and
without
discrimination.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
if
the
state
of
louisiana
here
had
passed
an
appropriate
statute,
presumably
and
there
had
been
no
election,
then
your
position
would
be
different
with
respect
to
the
force
of
that
state
statute,
would
it
not?
justice
abe
fortas
if
there
had
been
no
election
and
no
election
authorized,
no
election
called
for
by
law.
justice
abe
fortas
your
position
would
have
been
different.
justice
abe
fortas
i'd
like
to
get
back
to
something
that
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
you.
reading
the
record
here,
i
gather
that
there
is
louisiana
power
and
light
company,
a
privately
owned
utility
operating
in
the
city,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
city
have
an
electric
system
of
its
own?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
part
of
the
purpose
of
this
bond
issue
was
to
acquire
the
remaining
10
or
20%
of
the
facilities
serving
the
city,
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
now
was
there
a
contest
that
louisiana
light
and
power
--
power
and
light
participated
in
election
hearing
that
took
place
before
the
election
was
held?
justice
abe
fortas
but
i
do
see
that
the
appellant
here
is
a
qualified
voter.
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
that
if
one
were
compelled
to
defend
this
what
was
done
here,
one
might
argue
that
the
question
that
the
interest,
the
class
that
has
an
interest
and
whether
revenue
bonds
should
be
issued
is
the
class
of
property
owners
because
purpose
ill
affect
the
value
of
the
property
and
the
property
owners.
that
if
the
tenants,
the
users
of
the
utilities
that
therein
that
they
were
interest
of
the
users
of
the
utilities
is
in
the
rates
and
that
their
interest
in
the
question
of
the
issuance
of
the
bonds
as
the
secondary
one
is
too
remote
to
justify
vindication
in
the
courts
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i'm
sure
you
don't
accept
what
i
said
just
now
as
indicating
that
i've
persuaded
myself.
justice
abe
fortas
well
you?
justice
abe
fortas
can
you
tell
us
whether
every
state
has
a
finality
period
for
contesting
a
bond
issue
that
finality
period
that
is
measurable
in
months
rather
than
years?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i'm
sure
of
that
but
if
it
were
in
terms
of
years,
a
decision
such
as
your
request
might
very
well
be
extremely
disruptive
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
of
a
great
deal
of
money.
justice
abe
fortas
so
this
is
a
pretty
small
town,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
louisiana
power
and
light
has
about
what
10-20%
of
the
electric
system.
justice
abe
fortas
there
must
have
been
much
revenue
here
at
stake.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
i'm
talking
about
what's
the
real
interest
here,
in
louisiana
light
--
louisiana
power
and
light.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
