but
you,
nevertheless,
went
ahead
into
the
canadian

justice

i
gather,
you
prove
your
damages
by
saying
that
without

you
would've
had
this
similar
share
to
canadian
market
to
that
you
had
in

that's
the
--
well,
that's
the
core
of
your
damage
proof.
justice

without
any
embellishment

show
any

laid
off
your

do
you
think
that?
justice

i
suppose
that
there's

that
you
had
the
product
to
sell
then
you
had
volume
enough
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
where
you
equipped
with
the
distribution
system
or
were
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
was
there
testimony
suggesting
that
you
put
as
much
effort
into
developing
a
distribution
system
in
canada
as
you
put
in
the
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you
went
ahead.
you
went

you
sold
a

justice

white
radio

in

justice
byron

was
there
testimony

is
there
testimony

that
you
laid

the
canadian

justice
byron
r.
white
you
went
ahead
to
some
extent,
but
not
--
justice
byron

white
but
you
did
have
the
competing
theater.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
new
american
competitors
have
plants
in
canada?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
that.
i'm
just
thinking
about
the
damages.
now,
let's
assume
that
america
--
an
american
competitor
of
yours
who
has
10%
of
the
american
market
builds
a
plant
in
canada,
just
like
his
american
plant,
but
he
doesn't
do
it
--
do
--
and
he
tries
to
get
10%
of
the
canadian
market,
just
like
he's
got
in
the
united
states,
and
doesn't
do
it,
can't
he
somehow
get
more
than
5%?
justice
byron

white
but
there's
some
evidence
--
justice
byron
r.
white
there
must
be
some
evidence
around,
however,
as
to
how
american
--
your
american
competitors
have
there
when
they
went
into
canada
and
built
a
plant.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there's
not
in
this

i
just
suggest
that
there
may
be
some
evidence
available
to
that
extent.
justice
byron

white
well,
that
may
be.
and,
which
way
do
you
run
that,
for
you
or

justice

so
that,
the

that

who

it
still
gave
a

with

justice
byron

i'm
just
saying
that
what
the

came
out

all
that

to

a

for

justice

that

the

so,

yes,

you
said

the

i
take
