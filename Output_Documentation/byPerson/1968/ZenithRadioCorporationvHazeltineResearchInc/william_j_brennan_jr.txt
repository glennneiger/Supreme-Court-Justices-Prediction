is
that
something
new,
mr.
chadwell?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
something
new
and
unique?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me,
what
standard
do
we
apply
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
with
no
authority
do
we
--
the
gypsum
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean,
then
we
redo
what
the
court
of
appeals
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
we
don't
redo
it,
then
there
must
be
something
less
we
do.
what's
that?
what's
the
something
less?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
look
at
their
review
and
say
whether,
in
some
respect,
it
erred.
is
that
it?
that's
one
way
of
doing
it.
is
that
right?
well,
now
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
look
at
it
and
test
what
they
did
against
what
standard.
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to.
against
what
standard
do
we
test
whether
or
not
what
they
did
is
correct?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
sounds
to
me,
mr.
chadwell,
like
doing
over
again
what
they
did,
taking
this
record
and
applying
the
gypsum
test
and
independently
concluding
whether
the
gypsum
test
required
a
reversal.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
doing
that,
how
much
did
the
record
that
would
tie
do
you
think
we've
got
to
look
at?
justice
william
