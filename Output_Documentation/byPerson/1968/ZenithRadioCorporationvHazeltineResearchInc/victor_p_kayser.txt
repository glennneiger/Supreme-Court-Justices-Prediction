mr.
victor
p.
kayser
may
it
please
the
court.
before
getting
to
the
subject
of
canada,
i'd
like
to
devote
just
another
minute
on
the
subject
of
england
and,
i
think,
possibly
clarify
what
may
be
somewhat
of
a
misunderstanding.
the
fact
is
that,
as
to
england,
the
testimony
of
wright
and
kaplan
which
had
formed
the
basis
of
the
findings
was
two-fold.
first,
the
testimony
about
having
been
kept
out
of
england
by
the
pools
for
many
years,
which
was
disproved
by
the
later
proof
of
the
embargo,
this
was
one
part
of
their
factual
damage
theory
as
to
england,
that
the
pools
had
kept
them
from
developing
a
market
by
june
1959
from
which
developed
market
they
could
then
profit.
and
then,
the
second
part
of
their
assertion
was
that,
in
fact,
during
the
four
years,
they
were
interested
in
an
intent
in
going
into
england
and
does
--
the
testimony
that
mr.
chadwell
has
referred
to,
having
to
do
with
the
contention
they
built
a
few
sets
or
converted
a
few
sets
and
that
the
english
distributor
had
tried
to
sell
them,
that
evidence
had
been
put
in
to
indicate
interest
in
the
english
market.
and,
that
was
the
evidence
that
they
relied
on
to
show
interest
and
readiness
to
go
into
the
english
market
during
that
four-year
period.
now,
when
they
got
back
on
the
stand
and
were
forced
to
admit
that
that
testimony
was
not
true,
they
were
forced
to
admit
it
because
we
had
taken
the
distributor's
deposition
and
he
admitted
that
there
was
nothing
to
it.
when
they
were
forced
to
admit
that
there
was
nothing
to
their
original
testimony,
that
did
two
things.
number
one,
it
seriously
impaired,
we
submit,
their
credibility
on
all
aspects
but,
secondly,
it
knocked
out
the
second
of
the
two
aspects
upon
which
their
english
claim
was
based.
so,
at
that
point
in
fact,
they
have
no
evidence
in
this
record
on
which
to
base
any
claim
as
to
england
other
than
their
--
they
had
this
question
of
exhibit
220,
the
inferences
to
be
drawn
from
that,
which
i
will
come
to
later.
now,
secondly,
before
going
into
canada,
i
would
like
to
answer
the
questions
or
respond
to
the
inquiry
this
morning
as
concerns
the
matter
of
a
release.
now,
if
i
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
yes.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
repudiated
by
the
witnesses
themselves.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
yes,
that
plus
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
i
would
like
to
answer
that
in
two
parts,
if
i
may.
number
one,
i
should
say
that
on
the
point
of
intent
to
enter,
there
is
an
addition
to
the
fact
that
they
have
repudiated.
they
recanted
their
testimony.
there
is
also,
as
mr.
chadwell
has
said,
there
is
the
documentation
in
the
record
from
zenith's
own
bulk
exhibit
which
clearly
showed
that,
during
this
entire
period,
they
were
waiting
for
the
perspective
change
of
the
broadcast
standard.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
now,
on
your
second
question
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
on
your
second
question,
the
fact
is
that
we
--
as
shown
in
our
brief,
entirely
cited
from
any
aspect,
we
believe
that
it
is
--
that
the
record
shows
that,
from
january
1958,
if
they
in
fact
had
had
an
interest
in
entering
the
english
market
from
then
after
the
embargo
and
through
the
damage
period,
they
could've
obtained
the
license.
they
never
inquired
where
licensing
could
happen.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
we
--
frankly,
your
honor,
as
we
have
seen
this
case,
we
have
not
seen
it
fit
to
go
into
that
question.
we
consider
that
the
issue
of
the
fact
of
damage
which
was
found
in
favor
of
the
hazeltine
corporations
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
a
threshold
question.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
we
do
not,
but
we
are
not
arguing
it.
we
most
certainly
do
not
concede
it.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
on
the
court
of
appeals,
we
--
frankly,
your
honor,
we
made
a
very
brief
argument.
we
did
defend
the
legality
of
the
pools.
we
believe
that
they
are
lawful
but
there,
again,
our
thrust
was
on
the
question,
was
zenith
in
fact
hurt
and
also
on
the
issue
of
the
amount
of
damages,
as
well
as
other
several
issues.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
no,
your
honor.
i
--
as
i
say,
we
did
not
brief
it
exhaustively
there
and
we
have
not
briefly
exhaustively
here.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
your
honor,
we
--
faced
with
the
situation
into
which
we
had
been
thrust
there,
frankly,
we
had
to
form
a
judgment
as
to
what
emphasis
to
place.
we
had
a
client
who
had
the
judgment
of
$34
million
against
him.
we
felt
it
was
clear
that,
irrespective
of
the
question
of
legality
which,
certainly,
i
need
not
say.
and
if
an
area
like
this
is
a
very
complicated
area.
it
was
a
matter
of
judgment
to
put
our
thrust
where
we
thought
it
was
the
most
clear
that
the
judgment
below
--
judgments
below
were
wrong,
and
that's
what
we
did.
now,
on
the
issue
of
release,
i
think,
it,
and
i
will
spend
just
a
moment
on
that
but,
it
should
be
clear
that
the
releases
were
in
fact
pleaded
in
the
district
court
by
leave
of
court
and
before
entry
of
judgment
there.
and,
we
have
covered
that
point
in
our
reply
to
the
solicitor
general's
brief
where
the
point
was
made.
also,
i
think
it
should
be
pointed
out
that,
on
zenith's
reply
brief
filed
in
this
court
on
page
16,
zenith
admitted
that
the
trial
court
permitted
the
filing
of
the
briefs
--
of
the
pleas
as
of
a
date
a
year
after
the
trial
and
then
properly
overruled
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
counterclaim
on
these
grounds.
the
releases
were,
in
fact,
pleaded
admittedly
after
the
original
trial
but
before
judgment
by
leave
of
the
trial
court.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
your
honor,
again,
we
were
not
counsel
but
i
think
the
reason
they
were
not
pleaded
at
the
first
trial
was
because,
under
the
theory
of
action
which
was
set
forth
in
the
original
counterclaim,
there
would've
been
no
conceivable
basis
to
plead
them
because,
as
set
forth
in
that
counterclaim
and
in
that
motion
to
file
it
and,
in
the
affidavit
of
mr.
carodi,
counsel
--
one
of
counsel
for
zenith,
it
was
recited
that
the
acts
complained
of
which
formed
the
basis
of
this
counterclaim
which
was
not
filed
until
1963,
three
years
after
the
answer
had
taken
place,
after
the
filing
of
the
answer.
well
now,
that
was
a
span
of
three
years
before
filing
of
the
answer,
and
i
would
submit
it
would
be
quite
obvious
that,
under
those
circumstances,
the
release
would
have
no
possible
applicability.
and,
it
was
only
after,
as
we
pointed
out
in
brief,
zenith
switched
its
theory
of
action
to
claim
not
that
the
action
in
the
past
three
years
had
caused
damage
but
that,
by
reason
of
the
acts
going
back
to
1926,
as
you
--
if
you
heard,
zenith
had
been
damaged
in
the
effect
of
those.
it
wasn't
until
that
point
that
the
release
became
applicable
and,
at
that
time,
when
we
got
into
the
case
we
pleaded
it
and
we're
permitted
to
plead
it.
now,
as
to
the
question
of
canada,
i
think
we
must
remember
that
the
issue
that
we
have
here
is
whether
or
not
there
was
a
damaging
impact
by
the
canadian
pool
upon
zenith's
canadian
business
during
the
four-year
period.
and,
by
reason
of
the
testimony
given
by
the
zenith
witnesses,
the
final
ultimate
issue
or
question
there
is,
we
believe,
as
the
solicitor
general
correctly
stated
it,
namely
whether
zenith
was
unable
to
obtain
a
full-fledged
canadian
distribution
system
during
the
period
from
june
1959
through
may
1963
and,
if
not,
whether
such
inability
was
attributable
to
the
actions
of
the
canadian
pool.
now,
that
is
the
issue
as
to
canada
as
to
fact
of
damage.
now,
we've
heard
a
great
deal
this
morning
about
this
alleged
gigantic
international
worldwide
conspiracy
and,
incidentally,
the
proofs
and
the
findings
do
not
support
that.
but,
in
any
event,
we
have
heard
that
language
about
these
alleged
conspiracies
or
giant
conspiracy.
well,
there
are
several
observations
to
be
made
there.
first,
mr.
mcconnell
has
said,
as
to
canada,
that
its
evidence
is
almost
entirely
documentary
and,
yes,
it
is
and
it
is
all
before
1957.
secondly,
i
think
we
should
remember
that
zenith
is
not
entitled
to
any
recovery
here
by
reason
of
any
alleged
illegality
of
the
canadian
pool
or
any
other
pool
or
by
reason
of
any
overt
act
which
may
have
been
done.
it
is
entitled
to
recovery.
it
is
asking
that
it'd
be
paid
money.
it's
entitled
to
that
only
if
it
can
show
that
there
was
an
impact
--
a
damaging
impact
by
those
pools
upon
zenith's
business
during
the
four
years.
now,
what
does
the
record
show,
incidentally,
as
to
canada
after
the
1957
releases?
it
shows,
yes,
as
mr.
mcconnell
says,
it
shows
that
there
was
a
trade
builder
ad
in
august
1958
warning
about
infringement,
but
it
also
shows
that
mr.
wright
sent
a
telegram
and
a
letter,
a
very
strong
letter,
to
the
canadian
pool
and
said
"we
are
fully
licensed
under
all
canadian
patents
which
the
pool
controls.
thus,
we
consider
this
advertisement
detrimental
and,
if
you
ever
send
another
one
or
issue
another
one,
we'll
see
you
in
court."
and,
there
never
was.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
no,
zenith
has
communicated
with
the
pool.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
directly,
there
were
meetings.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
there
were
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
yes,
but
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
those
communications,
mr.
justice
white,
were
between
zenith
and
the
pool,
not
made
known
to
the
distributing
public.
but,
yes,
there
were
a
couple
of
meetings
and
there
was,
as
mr.
mcconnell
has
said
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
no,
the
pool
sent
zenith
a
license
form
in
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
which
called
for
manufacture
in
canada,
yes.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
no,
that
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
no,
that
letter,
as
i
recall,
referred
to
three
patents
which
it
was
believed
--
the
letter
said
it
was
believed
that
zenith
would
infringe.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
zenith
said
they
didn't
need
those
licenses,
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
--
your
honor.
zenith
took
the
position
that
it
was
fully
licensed
and,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
that
zenith
entered
the
canadian
market
and
they
sold
tens
and
tens
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
that
was
suggested,
but
no
action
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
it
was
said,
yes,
and
no
action
was
ever
taken.
zenith
continued
to
grow
into
canada.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
this
suit
has
absolutely
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
foreign
business
of
zenith
or
with
the
canadian
pool,
the
english
pool,
or
the
australian
pool,
and
i
think,
possibly,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
that
point
since
the
question
is
raised
right
now
because
mr.
mcconnell,
when
he
was
asked
on
that
question,
said
"yes,
there
was
a
finding
to
the
effect
that
there
was
a
connection
between
the
instant
patent
suit
and
the
canadian
operation."
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
yes,
that
there
was
a
connection.
however,
the
number
of
the
finding
he
gave
you,
which
i
believe
was
32,
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
domestic
litigation.
further,
the
finding
which
zenith
itself
submitted
and
was
entered
in
this
case,
finding
number
13,
after
reciting
the
domestic
activities
of
hazeltine
corporation
including
a
reference
to
the
incident
suit,
said
that
zenith's
--
the
injury
to
zenith's
business
and
property
from
the
domestic
suit
and
these
other
activities
was
$50,065.00
namely
the
cost
of
defending
the
litigation,
and
there
wasn't
a
word
in
any
of
those
findings
which,
in
any
way,
purported
to
connect
the
domestic
situation
or
the
domestic
suit
with
the
canadian
situation.
and,
in
fact,
not
only
is
there
nothing
in
the
record,
but
when
--
in
the
colloquy
which
i
had
with
the
trial
court
in
march
on
the
reopening,
that's
referred
to
at
page
26-27
of
our
brief,
he
made
it
quite
apparent
that,
in
his
opinion,
he
did
not
understand
that
there
was
any
connection
between
the
domestic
activities
of
hazeltine
research
and
the
foreign
activities
of
the
canadian
pool.
and,
the
court
of
appeals,
accordingly,
said
quite
correctly,
we
submit,
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
to
indicate
any
connection
and
that,
in
fact,
the
trial
court
never
took
that
suggestion
seriously.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
whether
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
we
don't
think
it
does,
your
honor,
but
zenith
has
argued
that
point
in
its
briefs.
they
think
it's
totally
irrelevant.
there
is
no
connection.
to
get
back
to
the
canadian
situation,
the
question
of
this
correspondence,
the
question
of
this
trade
builder,
and
it's
apparent
that
zenith
never
considered
it,
offered
threat
to
it
because
when
it
filed
its
answer
in
this
case
in
april
1960,
some-years
to
month
later,
if
it
had
felt
that
these
acts
constituted
a
threat
and
damage
to
it,
it
would've
been
a
compulsory
counterclaim
required
at
that
time.
and,
there
never
was
any
such
compulsory
counterclaim
until
may
1963
when
they
ascribed
their
damage
solely
to
acts
occurring
after
april
1960.
now,
wright
was
asked
by
his
counsel
as
to
exactly
what
were
the
clouds
or
difficulties
or
effects
which
the
alleged
activities
of
the
pool
had
on
zenith's
business
in
canada.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
mr.
justice
marshall,
this
is
part
of
my
next
point.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
thank
you.
mr.
wright
testified
as
to
two
alleged
effects
of
the
canadian
pool
and
its
activities
during
the
period,
and
he
said
they
had
to
do
with
the
holding
fact
on
advertising
and
promotion
and
they
had
an
effect
on
the
ability
to
get
distributors.
at
least
that
is
the
way
zenith
has
characterized
that
testimony.
now,
on
the
first
point
of
holding
back
on
advertising
and
promotion,
i
submit
that
that
point
is
no
longer
in
the
case
because
when
we
got
mr.
kaplan
back
on
the
stand
in
november
1965,
we
asked
him
about
zenith's
advertising
in
canada,
and
he
said
it
was
typical
to
what
you
would
expect
in
the
new
market.
in
fact,
he
implied
it
was
a
bit
larger
and,
further,
zenith
only
did
a
218
in
this
case.
shows
that
we're,
in
fact,
substantial
expenditures
and
advertising,
radio,
television,
newspapers,
magazines,
billboards,
you
name
it,
they
used
it.
the
government
feels
that
--
has
indicated
that
they
recognize
the
rights
that
this
is
out
of
the
case
and
we
most
certainly
agree,
but
i
think
it
should
be
pointed
out,
and
the
court
of
appeals
took
note
of
this
fact,
that
this
was
evidence
given
by
a
witness
later
shown
to
be
untrue
by
his
own
fellow
executive.
we
turn
then
to
the
second
question,
that
of
whether
or
not
has
--
and
the
government,
i
think,
put
it
fairly,
whether
or
not
zenith
was
in
fact
unable
to
obtain
a
full-fledged
canadian
distribution
during
the
four-year
period.
and,
i
submit,
that
is
the
crux
of
zenith's
entire
claim
as
to
canada.
now,
zenith
asserts
that
mr.
wright
testified
that
he
tried
to
get
distributors
but
he
had
problems.
he
could
get
some
at
western
canada
but
he
couldn't
get
them
in
the
other
portions
of
canada
because
of
the
canadian
pool.
but,
actually,
if
you
read
mr.
wright's
testimony
very
closely,
you
will
say
that
even
though
someone
might
get
that
impression,
he
didn't
say
that.
he
made
some
comments
to
the
effect
that
the
august
1958
trade
builder
ad,
things
of
that
type,
would
cause
a
serious
problem
of
getting
distributors,
but
he
never
testified
that,
in
fact,
there's
a
single
--
that
there
was
a
single
instance
where
he
had
failed
to
get
a
distributor
or
where
a
distributor
had
left
zenith.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
no,
your
honor,
that's
one
of
the
things
that
the
solicitor
general
pointed
out,
that
you
couldn't
tell
what
the
trial
court's
supposed
theory
was.
that
may
very
well
have
been
the
theory
that
they
should
be
awarded
damages
because
the
pool,
for
many
years
prior
to
that,
had
prevented
them
from
building
up
a
mature
market.
of
course,
as
we
pointed
out,
any
damage
based
on
that
theory
is
gone,
is
not
relevant
because
of
the
1956
releases.
secondly,
it
is
said
that
wright
testified
that
he
could
get
distributors
in
the
western
canada
but
had
trouble
elsewhere.
but,
the
fact
is
that,
if
his
testimony
is
examined,
all
he
said
was
that
they
could
get
distributors
in
western
canada.
they
had
a
less
success
in
the
central
and
eastern
provinces,
but
he
didn't
say
why.
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
we
shall
show
in
a
minute,
he
didn't
have
trouble
getting
distributors
anywhere
in
canada.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
we
shall
show
in
a
minute
the
fact
is
that
he
did
--
that
zenith
did
not
have
difficulty
getting
distributors.
by
1959,
they
were
boasting
they
had
a
nationwide
network
of
distributors,
effective
and
vigorous
at
all
levels.
so,
wright's
testimony,
as
i
shall
show
in
a
moment,
was
not
true.
now,
the
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
not
as
i
recall.
no,
the
findings
had
to
do
with
this
pre-1957
period
but
there
was,
of
course,
as
zenith
no
doubt
relies
on,
this
very
broad
conclusory
finding
about
drastic
curtailment.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
i
can
agree
that
there
is
--
there
was
a
record
which
would
justify
any
conclusion
of
the
fact
of
damage
because,
granted
a
pool
policy,
we
nevertheless
have
the
fact
that
zenith
considered
itself
fully
licensed,
took
that
position,
and
was
never
in
any
way
interfere
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
i
think
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
i
would
think
so,
mr.
justice,
depending
on
what
you
mean
adequate
basis.
i
think,
certainly,
this
is
--
there
is
the
issue
as
to
the
effect
of
rule
52
(a)
but,
striking
aside
from
that,
yes.
now,
i
would
like
then
to
come
back
to
this
matter
of
alleged
inability
to
get
distributors.
now,
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
recognized
that
the
proof
on
this
issue,
i
believe
he
recognized
that
it
was
lacking
or
certainly
of
very
low
standard,
and
he
made
the
comment
"no
person
can
be
certain
whether
zenith
would've
been
able
to
obtain
a
canadian
wide
group
of
distributors
notwithstanding
the
pool."
he
made
that
as
a
comment
and
as
a
justification
and
as
an
argument
for
possibly
supporting
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
but,
may
i
please
the
court,
this
brings
us
to
the
subject
of
zenith's
annual
reports
which,
yes,
are
not
in
evidence
but
they
were
in
existence.
they
were
in
an
offer
of
proof,
made
before
entry
of
judgment.
they
are
in
the
transcript
before
this
court.
we
believe,
and
mr.
mcconnell
recognizes,
the
court
may
take
judicial
notice
of
them
and
we
believe,
respectfully,
that
they
are
inescabpable
unless
the
truth
is
to
be
ignored.
i
think,
respectfully,
that
there
is
a
very
basic
question
presented
here,
granted
that
these
annual
reports
were
not
put
in
evidence
during
the
trial.
that's
undeniable,
but
the
fact
is
that
these
are
contemporaneous
documents
out
of
the
zenith
files.
they
are
the
highest
record
of
its
stewardship
to
its
shareholders
and
they
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
there
was
no
indication
that
the
pool
--
that,
beginning
after
the
release
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
that
is
right
and,
incidentally,
the
court
of
appeals
did
make
reference
to
the
release
in
its
opinion
at
page
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
your
honor,
given
the
proposition
that
zenith,
in
making
its
claim
and
in
having
a
market,
starts
from
scratch
would
have
to
start,
we
say,
from
scratch
in
1957
because
of
these
releases.
i
submit
that
these
annual
reports
in
this
offer
absolutely
destroy
any
notion
that,
with
that
starting
point,
zenith
did
not
do
as
well
as
it
could've.
in
fact,
this
--
these
reports
to
the
shareholders,
to
the
public
are
an
extended
story
of
success
after
success
after
success.
they
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
the
report
that
he
refers
to,
i
believe,
is
the
--
is
a
report
which
i
think
they
made
to
the
commerce
department
or
something
like
that.
it's
not
in
the
annual
report,
as
i
--
at
least
not
the
document
that
they
attach
to
their
brief.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
i
think,
your
honor,
you
could
take
judicial
notice
of
it
bec
--
but,
i
don't
think
it
means
anything.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
yes,
but
i
don't
think
it
means
anything.
but,
these
annual
reports,
which
i
say,
are
the
highest
report
of
the
corporations
of
its
stewardship
to
its
shareholders.
what
do
they
say?
i've
pointed
out
that
they
show
they
had
the
distributions
that
were
complete
by
1959.
in
1960,
they
report
that
zenith
successfully
countered
the
downward
industry
sales
trend
and
made
important
gains.
1961,
they
talk
about
gratifying
progress,
consistent
national
advertising,
and
the
enthusiasm
to
have
distributors
and
dealers,
as
resulting
in
a
doubling
of
their
sales.
now,
the
only
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
yes,
it
does.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
yes.
the
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
they
are
reproduced
in
full
in
the
appendix
a
to
our
brief,
the
reports
other
than
the
statistics
for
those
years.
yes,
the
excerpts
also
appear
beginning
at
page
55
of
our
brief.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
now,
zenith's
counsel
has
tried
to
dismiss
these
annual
reports
by
saying,
well,
a
corporation
doesn't
have
to
cry
on
its
shareholder's
shoulder
but,
of
course,
what
he
overlooks
is
that
these
reports
beginning
1957
are
really
a
very,
very
revealing
year
by
year
history
of
zenith's
operations,
and
they
are
in
direct
conflict
either
with
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
or
any
inferences
which
anyone
might
seek
to
draw
from
that.
and,
on
this
matter
of
crying
on
the
shareholder's
shoulder,
the
fact
is
that
zenith
did
exactly
that.
for
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
japanese
competition,
they
also
talked
about
the
problem
of
the
carafe
in
canada,
exchange
control
ratio.
in
1957,
as
they
said,
the
cartel
was
annulled
and
they
had
never
mentioned
it
again,
all
the
problems
in
the
cartel.
so,
it
really
is
a
very,
very
revealing
history.
well,
now,
i
would
like
to
spend
my
remaining
four-and-a
half
minutes
on
the
--
on
behalf
of
the
hazeltine
corporation
raising
the
jurisdictional
question
which
is
also
before
this
court.
and,
i
must
do
so
very
briefly
and
make
only
the
points
as
quickly
as
i
can.
first,
that
hazeltine
corporation,
the
parent,
was
never
named
a
party
to
the
litigation,
was
never
served
of
the
process,
never
filed
an
appearance,
and
the
litigation
was
solely
between
hazeltine
research
and
zenith
radio.
the
only
purported
basis
for
holding
the
parent
liable
was
the
stipulation
entered
into
may
7,
1963
and,
as
mr.
mcconnell
himself
said
this
morning,
that
stipulation
was
between
the
parties,
namely
hazeltine
research
and
zenith,
and
hazeltine
corporation
was
never
a
party
to
it.
and,
it
should
be
noticed
also
that
in
the
counterclaim
filed
in
this
case
which
was
some-three
weeks
after
the
stipulation,
although
zenith
referred
to
hazeltine
corporation
as
the
parent,
it
never
named
it
as
a
party
and,
in
fact,
in
the
claim
for
judgment
for
treble
damages,
a
judgment
was
asked
only
--
a
judgment
against
counter-defendant
hazeltine
research,
never
hazeltine
corporation.
now,
the
fact
is
also
that
both
zenith
and
the
trial
court
knew
that
hazeltine
corporation
was
not
before
the
court.
zenith,
in
its
brief
constantly
distinguished
between
the
parent
and
the
subsidiary,
said
that
mr.
dodds
represented
the
subsidiary,
not
the
plaintiff.
the
trial
judge
himself,
in
a
colloquy,
when
i
raised
the
question
that
hazeltine
corporation
was
not
a
party,
what
did
judge
austin
say?
"well,
of
course,
hazeltine
corporation
wasn't
a
party
to
the
lawsuit."
that's
the
trial
judge
speaking.
now,
finally,
and
i
think
this
is
really
very
significant
in
this
picture,
the
first
time
hazeltine
corporation
even
knew
that
there
was
any
thought
that
it
was
to
be
bound
by
the
judgments,
was
the
day
after
the
original
findings
calling
for
the
enormous
award
of
$49
million
were
entered.
and
then,
hazeltine
corporation
heard
about
it
over
a
doll
jones
tape
to
the
effect
that
zenith
counsel
has
advised
that
he
intends
to
ask
the
hazeltine
corporation
be
bound
by
the
judgment.
the
reason
for
this,
i
suggest,
is
obvious.
these
findings
for
$49
million
were
15-16-times
the
network
of
hazeltine
research,
in
fact,
substantially
greater
than
the
total
assets
of
hazeltine
corporation
and
its
subsidiaries.
but
at
least,
hazeltine
corporation
had
more
assets
that
hazeltine
research
and,
therefore,
zenith
decided
at
that
point
that
the
judgment
should
be
asserted
against
the
parent.
they
succeeded
in
getting
the
trial
court
to
do
that,
even
though
the
trial
court
himself
had
admitted
that
hazeltine
corporation
wasn't
a
party
to
the
lawsuit.
i
--
your
honor,
i
see
i
still
have
a
moment
more
of
time,
but
i
would
ask
if
anyone
has
any
questions.
i've
hurried
to
finish
within
my
time.
unless
has
any,
i
shall
sit
down.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
may
it
please
the
court.
before
getting
to
the
subject
of
canada,
i'd
like
to
devote
just
another
minute
on
the
subject
of
england
and,
i
think,
possibly
clarify
what
may
be
somewhat
of
a
misunderstanding.
the
fact
is
that,
as
to
england,
the
testimony
of
wright
and
kaplan
which
had
formed
the
basis
of
the
findings
was
two-fold.
first,
the
testimony
about
having
been
kept
out
of
england
by
the
pools
for
many
years,
which
was
disproved
by
the
later
proof
of
the
embargo,
this
was
one
part
of
their
factual
damage
theory
as
to
england,
that
the
pools
had
kept
them
from
developing
a
market
by
june
1959
from
which
developed
market
they
could
then
profit.
and
then,
the
second
part
of
their
assertion
was
that,
in
fact,
during
the
four
years,
they
were
interested
in
an
intent
in
going
into
england
and
does
--
the
testimony
that
mr.
chadwell
has
referred
to,
having
to
do
with
the
contention
they
built
a
few
sets
or
converted
a
few
sets
and
that
the
english
distributor
had
tried
to
sell
them,
that
evidence
had
been
put
in
to
indicate
interest
in
the
english
market.
and,
that
was
the
evidence
that
they
relied
on
to
show
interest
and
readiness
to
go
into
the
english
market
during
that
four-year
period.
now,
when
they
got
back
on
the
stand
and
were
forced
to
admit
that
that
testimony
was
not
true,
they
were
forced
to
admit
it
because
we
had
taken
the
distributor's
deposition
and
he
admitted
that
there
was
nothing
to
it.
when
they
were
forced
to
admit
that
there
was
nothing
to
their
original
testimony,
that
did
two
things.
number
one,
it
seriously
impaired,
we
submit,
their
credibility
on
all
aspects
but,
secondly,
it
knocked
out
the
second
of
the
two
aspects
upon
which
their
english
claim
was
based.
so,
at
that
point
in
fact,
they
have
no
evidence
in
this
record
on
which
to
base
any
claim
as
to
england
other
than
their
--
they
had
this
question
of
exhibit
220,
the
inferences
to
be
drawn
from
that,
which
i
will
come
to
later.
now,
secondly,
before
going
into
canada,
i
would
like
to
answer
the
questions
or
respond
to
the
inquiry
this
morning
as
concerns
the
matter
of
a
release.
now,
if
i
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
yes.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
repudiated
by
the
witnesses
themselves.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
yes,
that
plus
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
i
would
like
to
answer
that
in
two
parts,
if
i
may.
number
one,
i
should
say
that
on
the
point
of
intent
to
enter,
there
is
an
addition
to
the
fact
that
they
have
repudiated.
they
recanted
their
testimony.
there
is
also,
as
mr.
chadwell
has
said,
there
is
the
documentation
in
the
record
from
zenith's
own
bulk
exhibit
which
clearly
showed
that,
during
this
entire
period,
they
were
waiting
for
the
perspective
change
of
the
broadcast
standard.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
now,
on
your
second
question
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
on
your
second
question,
the
fact
is
that
we
--
as
shown
in
our
brief,
entirely
cited
from
any
aspect,
we
believe
that
it
is
--
that
the
record
shows
that,
from
january
1958,
if
they
in
fact
had
had
an
interest
in
entering
the
english
market
from
then
after
the
embargo
and
through
the
damage
period,
they
could've
obtained
the
license.
they
never
inquired
where
licensing
could
happen.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
we
--
frankly,
your
honor,
as
we
have
seen
this
case,
we
have
not
seen
it
fit
to
go
into
that
question.
we
consider
that
the
issue
of
the
fact
of
damage
which
was
found
in
favor
of
the
hazeltine
corporations
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
a
threshold
question.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
we
do
not,
but
we
are
not
arguing
it.
we
most
certainly
do
not
concede
it.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
on
the
court
of
appeals,
we
--
frankly,
your
honor,
we
made
a
very
brief
argument.
we
did
defend
the
legality
of
the
pools.
we
believe
that
they
are
lawful
but
there,
again,
our
thrust
was
on
the
question,
was
zenith
in
fact
hurt
and
also
on
the
issue
of
the
amount
of
damages,
as
well
as
other
several
issues.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
no,
your
honor.
i
--
as
i
say,
we
did
not
brief
it
exhaustively
there
and
we
have
not
briefly
exhaustively
here.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
your
honor,
we
--
faced
with
the
situation
into
which
we
had
been
thrust
there,
frankly,
we
had
to
form
a
judgment
as
to
what
emphasis
to
place.
we
had
a
client
who
had
the
judgment
of
$34
million
against
him.
we
felt
it
was
clear
that,
irrespective
of
the
question
of
legality
which,
certainly,
i
need
not
say.
and
if
an
area
like
this
is
a
very
complicated
area.
it
was
a
matter
of
judgment
to
put
our
thrust
where
we
thought
it
was
the
most
clear
that
the
judgment
below
--
judgments
below
were
wrong,
and
that's
what
we
did.
now,
on
the
issue
of
release,
i
think,
it,
and
i
will
spend
just
a
moment
on
that
but,
it
should
be
clear
that
the
releases
were
in
fact
pleaded
in
the
district
court
by
leave
of
court
and
before
entry
of
judgment
there.
and,
we
have
covered
that
point
in
our
reply
to
the
solicitor
general's
brief
where
the
point
was
made.
also,
i
think
it
should
be
pointed
out
that,
on
zenith's
reply
brief
filed
in
this
court
on
page
16,
zenith
admitted
that
the
trial
court
permitted
the
filing
of
the
briefs
--
of
the
pleas
as
of
a
date
a
year
after
the
trial
and
then
properly
overruled
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
counterclaim
on
these
grounds.
the
releases
were,
in
fact,
pleaded
admittedly
after
the
original
trial
but
before
judgment
by
leave
of
the
trial
court.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
your
honor,
again,
we
were
not
counsel
but
i
think
the
reason
they
were
not
pleaded
at
the
first
trial
was
because,
under
the
theory
of
action
which
was
set
forth
in
the
original
counterclaim,
there
would've
been
no
conceivable
basis
to
plead
them
because,
as
set
forth
in
that
counterclaim
and
in
that
motion
to
file
it
and,
in
the
affidavit
of
mr.
carodi,
counsel
--
one
of
counsel
for
zenith,
it
was
recited
that
the
acts
complained
of
which
formed
the
basis
of
this
counterclaim
which
was
not
filed
until
1963,
three
years
after
the
answer
had
taken
place,
after
the
filing
of
the
answer.
well
now,
that
was
a
span
of
three
years
before
filing
of
the
answer,
and
i
would
submit
it
would
be
quite
obvious
that,
under
those
circumstances,
the
release
would
have
no
possible
applicability.
and,
it
was
only
after,
as
we
pointed
out
in
brief,
zenith
switched
its
theory
of
action
to
claim
not
that
the
action
in
the
past
three
years
had
caused
damage
but
that,
by
reason
of
the
acts
going
back
to
1926,
as
you
--
if
you
heard,
zenith
had
been
damaged
in
the
effect
of
those.
it
wasn't
until
that
point
that
the
release
became
applicable
and,
at
that
time,
when
we
got
into
the
case
we
pleaded
it
and
we're
permitted
to
plead
it.
now,
as
to
the
question
of
canada,
i
think
we
must
remember
that
the
issue
that
we
have
here
is
whether
or
not
there
was
a
damaging
impact
by
the
canadian
pool
upon
zenith's
canadian
business
during
the
four-year
period.
and,
by
reason
of
the
testimony
given
by
the
zenith
witnesses,
the
final
ultimate
issue
or
question
there
is,
we
believe,
as
the
solicitor
general
correctly
stated
it,
namely
whether
zenith
was
unable
to
obtain
a
full-fledged
canadian
distribution
system
during
the
period
from
june
1959
through
may
1963
and,
if
not,
whether
such
inability
was
attributable
to
the
actions
of
the
canadian
pool.
now,
that
is
the
issue
as
to
canada
as
to
fact
of
damage.
now,
we've
heard
a
great
deal
this
morning
about
this
alleged
gigantic
international
worldwide
conspiracy
and,
incidentally,
the
proofs
and
the
findings
do
not
support
that.
but,
in
any
event,
we
have
heard
that
language
about
these
alleged
conspiracies
or
giant
conspiracy.
well,
there
are
several
observations
to
be
made
there.
first,
mr.
mcconnell
has
said,
as
to
canada,
that
its
evidence
is
almost
entirely
documentary
and,
yes,
it
is
and
it
is
all
before
1957.
secondly,
i
think
we
should
remember
that
zenith
is
not
entitled
to
any
recovery
here
by
reason
of
any
alleged
illegality
of
the
canadian
pool
or
any
other
pool
or
by
reason
of
any
overt
act
which
may
have
been
done.
it
is
entitled
to
recovery.
it
is
asking
that
it'd
be
paid
money.
it's
entitled
to
that
only
if
it
can
show
that
there
was
an
impact
--
a
damaging
impact
by
those
pools
upon
zenith's
business
during
the
four
years.
now,
what
does
the
record
show,
incidentally,
as
to
canada
after
the
1957
releases?
it
shows,
yes,
as
mr.
mcconnell
says,
it
shows
that
there
was
a
trade
builder
ad
in
august
1958
warning
about
infringement,
but
it
also
shows
that
mr.
wright
sent
a
telegram
and
a
letter,
a
very
strong
letter,
to
the
canadian
pool
and
said
"we
are
fully
licensed
under
all
canadian
patents
which
the
pool
controls.
thus,
we
consider
this
advertisement
detrimental
and,
if
you
ever
send
another
one
or
issue
another
one,
we'll
see
you
in
court."
and,
there
never
was.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
no,
zenith
has
communicated
with
the
pool.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
directly,
there
were
meetings.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
there
were
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
yes,
but
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
those
communications,
mr.
justice
white,
were
between
zenith
and
the
pool,
not
made
known
to
the
distributing
public.
but,
yes,
there
were
a
couple
of
meetings
and
there
was,
as
mr.
mcconnell
has
said
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
no,
the
pool
sent
zenith
a
license
form
in
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
which
called
for
manufacture
in
canada,
yes.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
no,
that
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
no,
that
letter,
as
i
recall,
referred
to
three
patents
which
it
was
believed
--
the
letter
said
it
was
believed
that
zenith
would
infringe.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
zenith
said
they
didn't
need
those
licenses,
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
--
your
honor.
zenith
took
the
position
that
it
was
fully
licensed
and,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
that
zenith
entered
the
canadian
market
and
they
sold
tens
and
tens
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
that
was
suggested,
but
no
action
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
it
was
said,
yes,
and
no
action
was
ever
taken.
zenith
continued
to
grow
into
canada.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
this
suit
has
absolutely
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
foreign
business
of
zenith
or
with
the
canadian
pool,
the
english
pool,
or
the
australian
pool,
and
i
think,
possibly,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
that
point
since
the
question
is
raised
right
now
because
mr.
mcconnell,
when
he
was
asked
on
that
question,
said
"yes,
there
was
a
finding
to
the
effect
that
there
was
a
connection
between
the
instant
patent
suit
and
the
canadian
operation."
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
yes,
that
there
was
a
connection.
however,
the
number
of
the
finding
he
gave
you,
which
i
believe
was
32,
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
domestic
litigation.
further,
the
finding
which
zenith
itself
submitted
and
was
entered
in
this
case,
finding
number
13,
after
reciting
the
domestic
activities
of
hazeltine
corporation
including
a
reference
to
the
incident
suit,
said
that
zenith's
--
the
injury
to
zenith's
business
and
property
from
the
domestic
suit
and
these
other
activities
was
$50,065.00
namely
the
cost
of
defending
the
litigation,
and
there
wasn't
a
word
in
any
of
those
findings
which,
in
any
way,
purported
to
connect
the
domestic
situation
or
the
domestic
suit
with
the
canadian
situation.
and,
in
fact,
not
only
is
there
nothing
in
the
record,
but
when
--
in
the
colloquy
which
i
had
with
the
trial
court
in
march
on
the
reopening,
that's
referred
to
at
page
26-27
of
our
brief,
he
made
it
quite
apparent
that,
in
his
opinion,
he
did
not
understand
that
there
was
any
connection
between
the
domestic
activities
of
hazeltine
research
and
the
foreign
activities
of
the
canadian
pool.
and,
the
court
of
appeals,
accordingly,
said
quite
correctly,
we
submit,
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
to
indicate
any
connection
and
that,
in
fact,
the
trial
court
never
took
that
suggestion
seriously.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
whether
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
we
don't
think
it
does,
your
honor,
but
zenith
has
argued
that
point
in
its
briefs.
they
think
it's
totally
irrelevant.
there
is
no
connection.
to
get
back
to
the
canadian
situation,
the
question
of
this
correspondence,
the
question
of
this
trade
builder,
and
it's
apparent
that
zenith
never
considered
it,
offered
threat
to
it
because
when
it
filed
its
answer
in
this
case
in
april
1960,
some-years
to
month
later,
if
it
had
felt
that
these
acts
constituted
a
threat
and
damage
to
it,
it
would've
been
a
compulsory
counterclaim
required
at
that
time.
and,
there
never
was
any
such
compulsory
counterclaim
until
may
1963
when
they
ascribed
their
damage
solely
to
acts
occurring
after
april
1960.
now,
wright
was
asked
by
his
counsel
as
to
exactly
what
were
the
clouds
or
difficulties
or
effects
which
the
alleged
activities
of
the
pool
had
on
zenith's
business
in
canada.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
mr.
justice
marshall,
this
is
part
of
my
next
point.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
thank
you.
mr.
wright
testified
as
to
two
alleged
effects
of
the
canadian
pool
and
its
activities
during
the
period,
and
he
said
they
had
to
do
with
the
holding
fact
on
advertising
and
promotion
and
they
had
an
effect
on
the
ability
to
get
distributors.
at
least
that
is
the
way
zenith
has
characterized
that
testimony.
now,
on
the
first
point
of
holding
back
on
advertising
and
promotion,
i
submit
that
that
point
is
no
longer
in
the
case
because
when
we
got
mr.
kaplan
back
on
the
stand
in
november
1965,
we
asked
him
about
zenith's
advertising
in
canada,
and
he
said
it
was
typical
to
what
you
would
expect
in
the
new
market.
in
fact,
he
implied
it
was
a
bit
larger
and,
further,
zenith
only
did
a
218
in
this
case.
shows
that
we're,
in
fact,
substantial
expenditures
and
advertising,
radio,
television,
newspapers,
magazines,
billboards,
you
name
it,
they
used
it.
the
government
feels
that
--
has
indicated
that
they
recognize
the
rights
that
this
is
out
of
the
case
and
we
most
certainly
agree,
but
i
think
it
should
be
pointed
out,
and
the
court
of
appeals
took
note
of
this
fact,
that
this
was
evidence
given
by
a
witness
later
shown
to
be
untrue
by
his
own
fellow
executive.
we
turn
then
to
the
second
question,
that
of
whether
or
not
has
--
and
the
government,
i
think,
put
it
fairly,
whether
or
not
zenith
was
in
fact
unable
to
obtain
a
full-fledged
canadian
distribution
during
the
four-year
period.
and,
i
submit,
that
is
the
crux
of
zenith's
entire
claim
as
to
canada.
now,
zenith
asserts
that
mr.
wright
testified
that
he
tried
to
get
distributors
but
he
had
problems.
he
could
get
some
at
western
canada
but
he
couldn't
get
them
in
the
other
portions
of
canada
because
of
the
canadian
pool.
but,
actually,
if
you
read
mr.
wright's
testimony
very
closely,
you
will
say
that
even
though
someone
might
get
that
impression,
he
didn't
say
that.
he
made
some
comments
to
the
effect
that
the
august
1958
trade
builder
ad,
things
of
that
type,
would
cause
a
serious
problem
of
getting
distributors,
but
he
never
testified
that,
in
fact,
there's
a
single
--
that
there
was
a
single
instance
where
he
had
failed
to
get
a
distributor
or
where
a
distributor
had
left
zenith.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
no,
your
honor,
that's
one
of
the
things
that
the
solicitor
general
pointed
out,
that
you
couldn't
tell
what
the
trial
court's
supposed
theory
was.
that
may
very
well
have
been
the
theory
that
they
should
be
awarded
damages
because
the
pool,
for
many
years
prior
to
that,
had
prevented
them
from
building
up
a
mature
market.
of
course,
as
we
pointed
out,
any
damage
based
on
that
theory
is
gone,
is
not
relevant
because
of
the
1956
releases.
secondly,
it
is
said
that
wright
testified
that
he
could
get
distributors
in
the
western
canada
but
had
trouble
elsewhere.
but,
the
fact
is
that,
if
his
testimony
is
examined,
all
he
said
was
that
they
could
get
distributors
in
western
canada.
they
had
a
less
success
in
the
central
and
eastern
provinces,
but
he
didn't
say
why.
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
we
shall
show
in
a
minute,
he
didn't
have
trouble
getting
distributors
anywhere
in
canada.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
we
shall
show
in
a
minute
the
fact
is
that
he
did
--
that
zenith
did
not
have
difficulty
getting
distributors.
by
1959,
they
were
boasting
they
had
a
nationwide
network
of
distributors,
effective
and
vigorous
at
all
levels.
so,
wright's
testimony,
as
i
shall
show
in
a
moment,
was
not
true.
now,
the
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
not
as
i
recall.
no,
the
findings
had
to
do
with
this
pre-1957
period
but
there
was,
of
course,
as
zenith
no
doubt
relies
on,
this
very
broad
conclusory
finding
about
drastic
curtailment.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
i
can
agree
that
there
is
--
there
was
a
record
which
would
justify
any
conclusion
of
the
fact
of
damage
because,
granted
a
pool
policy,
we
nevertheless
have
the
fact
that
zenith
considered
itself
fully
licensed,
took
that
position,
and
was
never
in
any
way
interfere
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
i
think
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
i
would
think
so,
mr.
justice,
depending
on
what
you
mean
adequate
basis.
i
think,
certainly,
this
is
--
there
is
the
issue
as
to
the
effect
of
rule
52
(a)
but,
striking
aside
from
that,
yes.
now,
i
would
like
then
to
come
back
to
this
matter
of
alleged
inability
to
get
distributors.
now,
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
recognized
that
the
proof
on
this
issue,
i
believe
he
recognized
that
it
was
lacking
or
certainly
of
very
low
standard,
and
he
made
the
comment
"no
person
can
be
certain
whether
zenith
would've
been
able
to
obtain
a
canadian
wide
group
of
distributors
notwithstanding
the
pool."
he
made
that
as
a
comment
and
as
a
justification
and
as
an
argument
for
possibly
supporting
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
but,
may
i
please
the
court,
this
brings
us
to
the
subject
of
zenith's
annual
reports
which,
yes,
are
not
in
evidence
but
they
were
in
existence.
they
were
in
an
offer
of
proof,
made
before
entry
of
judgment.
they
are
in
the
transcript
before
this
court.
we
believe,
and
mr.
mcconnell
recognizes,
the
court
may
take
judicial
notice
of
them
and
we
believe,
respectfully,
that
they
are
inescabpable
unless
the
truth
is
to
be
ignored.
i
think,
respectfully,
that
there
is
a
very
basic
question
presented
here,
granted
that
these
annual
reports
were
not
put
in
evidence
during
the
trial.
that's
undeniable,
but
the
fact
is
that
these
are
contemporaneous
documents
out
of
the
zenith
files.
they
are
the
highest
record
of
its
stewardship
to
its
shareholders
and
they
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
there
was
no
indication
that
the
pool
--
that,
beginning
after
the
release
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
that
is
right
and,
incidentally,
the
court
of
appeals
did
make
reference
to
the
release
in
its
opinion
at
page
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
your
honor,
given
the
proposition
that
zenith,
in
making
its
claim
and
in
having
a
market,
starts
from
scratch
would
have
to
start,
we
say,
from
scratch
in
1957
because
of
these
releases.
i
submit
that
these
annual
reports
in
this
offer
absolutely
destroy
any
notion
that,
with
that
starting
point,
zenith
did
not
do
as
well
as
it
could've.
in
fact,
this
--
these
reports
to
the
shareholders,
to
the
public
are
an
extended
story
of
success
after
success
after
success.
they
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
the
report
that
he
refers
to,
i
believe,
is
the
--
is
a
report
which
i
think
they
made
to
the
commerce
department
or
something
like
that.
it's
not
in
the
annual
report,
as
i
--
at
least
not
the
document
that
they
attach
to
their
brief.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
i
think,
your
honor,
you
could
take
judicial
notice
of
it
bec
--
but,
i
don't
think
it
means
anything.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
yes,
but
i
don't
think
it
means
anything.
but,
these
annual
reports,
which
i
say,
are
the
highest
report
of
the
corporations
of
its
stewardship
to
its
shareholders.
what
do
they
say?
i've
pointed
out
that
they
show
they
had
the
distributions
that
were
complete
by
1959.
in
1960,
they
report
that
zenith
successfully
countered
the
downward
industry
sales
trend
and
made
important
gains.
1961,
they
talk
about
gratifying
progress,
consistent
national
advertising,
and
the
enthusiasm
to
have
distributors
and
dealers,
as
resulting
in
a
doubling
of
their
sales.
now,
the
only
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
yes,
it
does.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
yes.
the
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
they
are
reproduced
in
full
in
the
appendix
a
to
our
brief,
the
reports
other
than
the
statistics
for
those
years.
yes,
the
excerpts
also
appear
beginning
at
page
55
of
our
brief.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
now,
zenith's
counsel
has
tried
to
dismiss
these
annual
reports
by
saying,
well,
a
corporation
doesn't
have
to
cry
on
its
shareholder's
shoulder
but,
of
course,
what
he
overlooks
is
that
these
reports
beginning
1957
are
really
a
very,
very
revealing
year
by
year
history
of
zenith's
operations,
and
they
are
in
direct
conflict
either
with
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
or
any
inferences
which
anyone
might
seek
to
draw
from
that.
and,
on
this
matter
of
crying
on
the
shareholder's
shoulder,
the
fact
is
that
zenith
did
exactly
that.
for
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
japanese
competition,
they
also
talked
about
the
problem
of
the
carafe
in
canada,
exchange
control
ratio.
in
1957,
as
they
said,
the
cartel
was
annulled
and
they
had
never
mentioned
it
again,
all
the
problems
in
the
cartel.
so,
it
really
is
a
very,
very
revealing
history.
well,
now,
i
would
like
to
spend
my
remaining
four-and-a
half
minutes
on
the
--
on
behalf
of
the
hazeltine
corporation
raising
the
jurisdictional
question
which
is
also
before
this
court.
and,
i
must
do
so
very
briefly
and
make
only
the
points
as
quickly
as
i
can.
first,
that
hazeltine
corporation,
the
parent,
was
never
named
a
party
to
the
litigation,
was
never
served
of
the
process,
never
filed
an
appearance,
and
the
litigation
was
solely
between
hazeltine
research
and
zenith
radio.
the
only
purported
basis
for
holding
the
parent
liable
was
the
stipulation
entered
into
may
7,
1963
and,
as
mr.
mcconnell
himself
said
this
morning,
that
stipulation
was
between
the
parties,
namely
hazeltine
research
and
zenith,
and
hazeltine
corporation
was
never
a
party
to
it.
and,
it
should
be
noticed
also
that
in
the
counterclaim
filed
in
this
case
which
was
some-three
weeks
after
the
stipulation,
although
zenith
referred
to
hazeltine
corporation
as
the
parent,
it
never
named
it
as
a
party
and,
in
fact,
in
the
claim
for
judgment
for
treble
damages,
a
judgment
was
asked
only
--
a
judgment
against
counter-defendant
hazeltine
research,
never
hazeltine
corporation.
now,
the
fact
is
also
that
both
zenith
and
the
trial
court
knew
that
hazeltine
corporation
was
not
before
the
court.
zenith,
in
its
brief
constantly
distinguished
between
the
parent
and
the
subsidiary,
said
that
mr.
dodds
represented
the
subsidiary,
not
the
plaintiff.
the
trial
judge
himself,
in
a
colloquy,
when
i
raised
the
question
that
hazeltine
corporation
was
not
a
party,
what
did
judge
austin
say?
"well,
of
course,
hazeltine
corporation
wasn't
a
party
to
the
lawsuit."
that's
the
trial
judge
speaking.
now,
finally,
and
i
think
this
is
really
very
significant
in
this
picture,
the
first
time
hazeltine
corporation
even
knew
that
there
was
any
thought
that
it
was
to
be
bound
by
the
judgments,
was
the
day
after
the
original
findings
calling
for
the
enormous
award
of
$49
million
were
entered.
and
then,
hazeltine
corporation
heard
about
it
over
a
doll
jones
tape
to
the
effect
that
zenith
counsel
has
advised
that
he
intends
to
ask
the
hazeltine
corporation
be
bound
by
the
judgment.
the
reason
for
this,
i
suggest,
is
obvious.
these
findings
for
$49
million
were
15-16-times
the
network
of
hazeltine
research,
in
fact,
substantially
greater
than
the
total
assets
of
hazeltine
corporation
and
its
subsidiaries.
but
at
least,
hazeltine
corporation
had
more
assets
that
hazeltine
research
and,
therefore,
zenith
decided
at
that
point
that
the
judgment
should
be
asserted
against
the
parent.
they
succeeded
in
getting
the
trial
court
to
do
that,
even
though
the
trial
court
himself
had
admitted
that
hazeltine
corporation
wasn't
a
party
to
the
lawsuit.
i
--
your
honor,
i
see
i
still
have
a
moment
more
of
time,
but
i
would
ask
if
anyone
has
any
questions.
i've
hurried
to
finish
within
my
time.
unless
has
any,
i
shall
sit
down.
