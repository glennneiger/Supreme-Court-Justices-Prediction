mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
i
represent
the
zenith
radio
corporation
which
is
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
respondents
are
the
hazeltine
research,
inc.,
a
corporation
which
is
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
the
hazeltine
corporation.
and,
it
was
stipulated
by
the
parties
in
this
case
in
a
pretrial
stipulation
that,
for
all
purposes
in
this
lawsuit
and
all
purposes
in
the
instant
case,
that
the
two
corporations
should
be
considered
one
and
the
same.
the
instant
suit
was
brought
for
the
alleged
infringement
of
a
patent,
a
monochrome
patent
alleged
to
have
been
infringed
by
the
zenith
corporation.
and,
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
below,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
that
patent
was
invalid
and
not
infringed.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
i'm
going
to
reach
that
in
the
course
of
my
argument.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
there
is
that
issue,
your
honor.
i
simply
made
a
statement
because
--
as
part
of
the
facts
in
the
case
that
there
was
that
pretrial
stipulation
and
i'm
treating,
for
this
portion
of
the
argument,
the
two
corporations
as
the
same.
in
that
suit,
zenith
answered
by
setting
up
a
patent
and
other
patents
of
hazeltine
have
been
misused
by
putting
them
into
foreign
patent
pools,
which
foreign
patent
pools
had
refused
to
license
imports
and
had
restricted
commerce
between
united
states
and
foreign
countries,
namely
canada,
england,
and
australia,
contrary
to
the
provisions
of
the
antitrust
law,
the
federal
antitrust
law
that
any
restriction
or
any
combination,
conspiracy,
or
arrangement
between
competitors
which
restrain
commerce
not
only
between
the
states
of
the
united
states
but
between
the
comp
--
the
country
of
the
united
states
and
foreign
countries,
violated
section
4
of
the
clayton
act,
sections
1
and
2
of
the
sherman
act.
and,
under
those
two
sections,
also
section
16
of
the
clayton
act,
alleging
the
same
facts
as
we'd
set
up
in
the
misused
answer
we
filed
in
counterclaim
and,
in
that
counterclaim,
asked
for
travel
damages
and
asked
for
an
injunction
against
the
activities
of
these
foreign
patent
tools.
after
a
trial
and
findings
of
fact
in
detail
made
by
the
district
court,
a
judgment
was
entered
on
april
5,
1965
pursuant
to
rule
54
(b)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
for
damages
which
have
been
occasioned
by
the
plaintiff
or
by
the
counterclaim
in
the
amount
of
$19,042,173
for
the
loss
of
sales
and
profits
in
the
canadian
market
in
the
sale
of
home
receiving
sets
in
television
and
radio.
at
the
time
the
findings
came
down,
hazeltine
obtained
new
counsel
and
came
in
and
made
various
motions
which
are
discussed
in
the
briefs,
purport
of
which
was
to
reopen
the
case
on
evidence
which
was
available
at
the
time
of
the
trial
and
for
further
proceedings
on
the
claim
that
there
were
embargoes
imposed
by
the
government
as
opposed
to
private
patent
pools
and
conspiracies
in
england
and
australia.
and,
for
that
limited
purpose,
the
case
was
reopened
and
after
further
hearing,
on
december
13,
1965,
the
trial
court
awarded
petitioner
trouble
damages
in
the
amount
of
$15,919,458
for
loss
of
sales
and
profits
in
england
and
australia
during
the
damage
period.
in
the
first
judgment,
an
injunction
was
added
against
the
continuance
by
the
respondent
companies
and
these
pools
for
putting
their
patents
in
the
pools
or
in
any
way
furthering
the
activities
of
these
pools,
and
this
is
important.
no
supercedias
was
ever
foiled
to
that
judgment,
even
though
there
was
an
appeal,
and
since
that
first
judgment
was
entered
on
april
15,
19
--
or
april
5,
1965,
zenith
has
been
operating
under
the
protection
of
the
injunction
of
the
united
states
district
court
in
their
activities
in
kent.
on
appeal
or
in
entering
the
last
judgment
after
the
trial
court
had
heard
all
the
evidence
that
was
produced
on
the
original
trial
press,
all
of
the
different
matters
which
were
urged
and
argued
in
a
three
or
four-day
hearing
on
the
motions
to
reopen
the
case
and
after
hearing
everything
that
was
submitted
in
the
case,
trial
court
made
this
comment,
"there
could
be
no
question
in
my
mind
that
zenith
suffered
damages
during
the
damage
period
by
a
virtue
of
the
pools
which
i
have
found
and,
reiterate,
existed
at
the
time
of
the
damage
period."
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
both
the
judgments
on
the
ground
that
there
is
no
substantial
evidence
in
this
record
that
zenith
was
injured
by
the
activities
of
these
pools
in
its
business
or
property,
and
held
as
a
matter
of
law
that,
on
this
record,
zenith
was
not
even
threatened
with
injury
by
the
activities
of
these
pools.
now,
the
proof
of
injury
to
zenith's
business
in
canada
was,
in
a
large
part,
documentary
and
i'm
going
into
it
in
some
detail
in
the
course
of
this
argument,
and
was
not
denied
by
any
single
witness
or
document
in
this
case.
so,
it
is
my
submission
to
this
court
that
what
is
presented
is
whether
on
admitted
facts,
which
we
claim
in
the
district
court,
found
was
unequivocal
in
its
proof
of
actual
substantial
damage
to
the
zenith
corporation,
whether
under
those
admitted
facts,
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
federal
antitrust
laws,
namely
1
and
2
of
the
sherman
act
and
4
and
16
of
the
clayton
act,
do
not
reach
and
have
no
sanction
which
will
stop
that
country.
now,
before
going
to
the
individual
markets,
i
want
to
--
if
the
court
will
bear
with
me,
i
want
to
take
just
a
few
minutes
to
give
some
of
the
background
of
this
conspiracy.
and,
this
court
in
1962
and
in
subsequent
cases
has
held,
namely
in
the
continental
ore
case,
that
conspiracies
which
are
designed
to
control
a
complete
market
and
which
are
put
together
by
competitors
to
exclude
competition
permanent
should
not
be
judged
by
taking
particular
parts
of
the
proofs
and
examining
them
and
passing
on
to
something
else,
but
that
the
proof
should
be
looked
at
as
a
whole
and,
in
the
continental
ore
case,
that
it
was
highly
relevant
to
go
back
and
look
at
the
proofs
at
the
inception
of
the
conspiracy
and
the
proofs
out
of
which
the
conspiracy
was
created
to
show
its
intendment,
its
purpose,
its
effect,
and
its
result.
now,
i've
been
in
this
litigation
with
these
pools
on
behalf
of
zenith
since
1953
and
i'm
not
going
to
refer
any
of
my
own
personal
knowledge.
everything
i'm
going
to
tell
this
court
with
reference
to
the
beginning
is
in
this
record.
and,
may
i
say
at
the
threshold
of
this
case,
the
documentary
evidence
in
this
case
came
in
by
a
pretrial
stipulation
without
any
objection
that
documents
as
to
their
varied,
all
admitted,
no
objection
to
them
whatever,
no
contravening
evidence
of
any
kind,
and
some
of
it
and
most
of
it
and
the
part
i'm
now
going
to
talk
about,
put
in
by
my
opponents
in
the
trial
court.
from
1919
until
1935,
through
some-50
cross
licensing
agreements,
the
leading
electronic
companies
of
the
world
divided
up
the
markets
of
the
world,
i'm
leaving
out
the
iron
curtain
countries.
i'm
talking
now
about
the
free
world
countries
where
competition
is
possible.
among
those
companies
were
the
telephone
companies:
the
westinghouse
company,
rca,
general
electric
company,
english
electric
company,
the
telefunken
company,
the
general
electric
company
of
germany,
gts,
the
french
company,
standard
cables
and
wireless,
the
australian
company,
and
the
philips
company
of
harland
which
we
find
everywhere
which
is
the
largest
electronics
company
and
probably
the
largest
aggregation
of
capital
and
business
in
the
entire
world.
now,
all
of
these
companies
shoulder-to-shoulder
and
by
cross
licensing
agreement
divided
the
free
world
up
into
markets
and
part
of
that
was
the
north
american
continent
which
was
assigned
to
the
so-called
radio
group.
and,
the
radio
group
was
composed
of
the
telephone
company,
that's
american
telephone
and
telegraph
company,
general
electric,
rca,
the
westinghouse
company,
and
the
philips
company.
zenith
came
into
conflict
and
confrontation
with
this
worldwide
conspiracy
when,
in
1933,
rca
with
10,000
patents
in
the
pool
which
was
composed
of
patents
contributed
by
all
the
companies
that
i
have
now
mentioned,
some-10,000
of
them,
asserted
them
against
zenith
and
demanded
that
we
take
a
license.
and,
we
took
the
position
and
said
so
in
our
pleadings
which
are
in
this
case
that
the
whole
industry
in
the
united
states
had
paid
tribute
to
this
pool
for
years
and
$1,300,000.00
or
so
have
been
paid
in
tribute
to
the
pool,
that
the
pools
were
illegal
and
we
filed
a
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
down
in
delaware
asking
for
a
determination
that
the
pools
were
illegal,
and
the
case
was
before
judge
leigh,
now
dead.
immediately,
the
pool
countered
with
63
patent
suits
against
us
in
that
proceeding.
parenthetically,
we
got
the
trial
and
one
of
them,
it
took
18
months
to
try
it.
if
we
tried
them
all,
there
wouldn't
have
been
a
lawyer
left
alive
who'd
ever
had
any
connection
with
the
case.
they
countered
out
of
that
suit
by
suing
zenith
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
chicago
on
two
patents:
the
telephone
company,
rca
and
general
electric.
and,
in
that
suit,
zenith
counterclaimed
and
set
up
a
suit
for
trouble
damages
claiming
that
they
had
been
excluded
from
the
market
in
canada
and
couldn't
sell
their
goods
there
because
of
the
pool
which
was
part
of
the
overall
conspiracy,
the
pool
known
as
canadian
radio
patents
limited.
that
suit
got
down
to
trial
that
they
go
to
trial
on
september
9,
1957.
the
sunday
before
it
went
to
trial,
the
parties
settled
the
case
by
paying
zenith
$10
million,
giving
zenith
the
patent
rights
inventing
these
black
and
white
monochrome
patents
in
all
markets
and
in
the
--
and,
the
suit
down
at
delaware
was
dismissed
upon
there
and,
in
effect,
dedicate
the
patents,
10,000
of
them,
to
the
train.
now,
i
brought
that
in
for
a
purpose
because
zenith
is
represented
here
as,
in
some
way,
taking
advantage
of
the
antitrust
laws
when,
i
submit,
on
the
entire
record,
they
have
done
very
constructive
service
under
the
antitrust
laws,
and
they
free
the
entire
american
market
so
that,
from
that
time
on,
and
the
relevance
of
this
is
on
the
damage
proof
that
from
that
time
on,
we
had
a
free
market
in
united
states.
and,
with
a
free
market,
zenith
came
from
a
little
small
company
hardly
known
to
the
leading
company
in
television
and,
i
think,
the
second
or
third
producer
in
the
united
states
in
radio.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
no.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
well,
i
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
i
haven't
been
frank
with
your
honor
entirely.
i
believe
that
hazeltine
was
named,
if
not
in
the
pleading,
certainly
in
the
proofs
as
a
co-conspirator.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
no.
there
is
no
such
evidence
in
this
record.
there
is
no
release
in
this
record.
there
is
some
settlement
papers
in
this
record
put
in
by
my
opponents,
not
me.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
there
is
an
issue
in
dispute
on
that,
first,
as
to
the
fact.
i
don't
agree
that
any
release
ever
released
hazeltine.
definitely,
i
do
not.
secondly,
no
release
was
ever
pleaded
in
this
case
and
no
release
was
ever
mentioned
in
this
case
until
one
year
after
the
case
had
been
tried,
at
which
time,
they
came
in
with
an
offer
of
proof
of
a
release.
now,
we
cited
cases
in
our
brief
that
under
rule
8,
i
believe,
and
15,
affirmative
defenses
have
to
be
pleaded
in
a
case
so
the
party
opposed
can
meet
them.
and,
no
such
plea
was
made.
the
case
wasn't
tried
on
any
release
theory.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
you
do.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
exactly.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
i
say,
further
than
that,
not
only
does
it
not
release
hazeltine
but
it
isn't
even
an
issue
in
the
case,
except
brought
in
later
by
offers
of
proof,
alright.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
under
the
rules,
your
honor,
under
the
federal
rules
unless
an
affirmative
defense
is
pleaded
during
the
trial,
so
you
could
meet
it.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
during
the
trial
or
so
close
to
it
that
the
parties
are
there
trying
their
lawsuit.
it's
waived,
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
seventh
circuit
has
handed
down
three
cases
that
says
even
a
court
can't
relieve
them
of
the
waiver.
there's
nothing
that
can
be
done.
they've
waived
it,
and
the
reason
for
it
is
we
try
our
lawsuit
on
the
pleadings
and
we
go
in
there.
they
put
this
settlement
in
to
show
that
the
two
cases
were
different.
that's
what
they
said.
they
told
the
court,
why
is
it
a
different
case?
that's
the
funniest
plea
of
release
i
ever
heard,
and
there
was
never
any
plea
of
release
and
there
was
never
any
evidence
offered
on
it,
and
no
court
ever
opened
it
up
either
in
the
district
court
or
in
the
court
below
to
permit
such
a
defense
to
be
made.
and,
i
say
the
issue
is
not
before
this
court.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
if
this
court
disagrees
with
me,
well,
i
say
it
had
absolutely
no
bearing
on
the
subject.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
this
is
the
last
resort.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
not
in
this
respect
and
for
a
reason.
i
mean,
you
can't
try
cases
on
offers
of
proof
made
after
the
case
has
been
submitted
and
you're
up
in
the
upper
court
with
no
chance
to
show
what
the
release
was
or
where
it
was
admitted
or
what
the
objections
to
tort
are
and
what
it
included
in
all
the
factual
matters
that
were
involved.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
i
am
saying
that
this
offer
was
made
after
findings
of
fact
had
been
made
and
the
case
have
been
tried.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes,
still
in
the
trial
court,
but
the
release
was
available
at
the
trial
and
not
offered
new
theory.
and
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
no,
the
court
of
appeals
said
nothing
about
the
release.
alright,
so
much
for
the
background
in
this
case,
i
do
want
to
say,
however,
that
there
is
an
anomaly
from
what
i
have
said
already,
in
that,
some
of
the
leading
lawyers
in
this
country:
whitney
norcimo
or
--
who's
later
president
of
the
bar
asso
--
the
american
bar
association
and
john
k.
hill,
leading
lawyer
in
there,
advised
their
clients
to
pay
$10
million
for
damages
suffered
by
zenith
up
until
1957
and
this
lower
court
now
holds,
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
sort
of
a
conspiracy
couldn't
cause
any
damage
whatever.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
no.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
right.
that's
all
the
court
dealt
with
the
parent,
assume
tacitly,
i
believe
it
had
to,
to
reach
this
point.
and,
the
government
has
filed
a
brief
here.
i
mean,
there
really
isn't
any
question
really
about
the
illegality
of
these
pools
under
the
decisions
of
this
court.
alright,
i
first
want
to
address
myself
to
the
canadian
market.
were
we
damaged?
was
there
substantial
evidence
of
damage
in
the
canadian
market?
in
1926,
there
was,
put
together
up
in
canada,
canadian
radios
patent
limited
and
it
was
composed
of
our
competitors,
people
who
sold
radio
and
television
sets
in
competition
with
us
here
and
in
canada,
if
we
ever
got
into
the
market.
i
have
never
seen
a
case,
and
i'm
sure
this
court
hasn't
either,
where
the
evidence
of
the
conspiracy
is
written
down
sponsored
and
put
in
evidence
by
the
respondents.
usually,
the
conspiracy
case
we
have
to
try
is
a
case
where
he
went
for
a
conspiracy
from
a
number
of
different
acts.
and,
this
court
held
in
--
a
long
time
ago
in
the
interstate
circuit
case
that
the
old
days
of
proving
conspiracy
by
having
people
gathered
around
the
table
had
gone
to
a
darker
age.
now,
we
prove
conspiracies,
particularly
business
conspiracies,
by
showing
a
plan
which
it
is
designed
to
destroy
or
interfere
with
competition
and
a
joiner
in
it
would
not
of
its
intent
or
purport.
that's
what
you
have
to
prove,
but
we
have
nothing
in
the
way
of
inference
in
that
sort
of
proof.
but,
to
understand
the
impact
on
the
damage
issue,
this
court
has
to
see
what
this
conspiracy
was
designed
to
do,
namely
to
control
a
complete
market,
pursuant
to
an
overall
conspiracy
to
control
all
the
markets
of
the
world.
plaintiff's
exhibit
50
(a),
which
was
put
into
evidence
by
my
opponents,
i
didn't
put
it
in.
they
put
it.
it
was
a
report
by
the
royal
canadian
commission.
on
a
submission
made
by
canadian
radio
patents
limited
where
somebody
up
their
distributor
had
complained
that
they
were
keeping
him
from
importing
sets
into
canada,
and
they
heard
all
the
evidence
and
they
issued
a
report
and
i
want
to
read
some
of
it,
if
the
court
would
bear
with
me.
this
is
the
whole
conspiracy
so
far
as
canada
is
concerned.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
a
royal
canadian
commission
and
it
was
issued
and
dated
december
31,
1959
within
this
damage
period
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
i
am
reading
from
plaintiff's
exhibit
50
(a)
which
is
found
in
the
record
at
appendix
2811
and
2829-30.
canadian
radio
patents
limited,
hereafter
called
crpl,
was
incorporated
in
1926
for
the
purpose
of
acting
as
a
patent
licensing
agency.
at
the
time
of
the
presentation
of
its
brief
to
this
commission,
it
acted
as
a
central
patent
licensing
agency
in
the
administration
of
patent
rights
in
the
radio,
television,
and
general
electronics
steels
in
respect
to
patents
owned
by
its
then
five
shareholders:
canadian
general
electric
company,
canadian
westinghouse
company,
northern
electric
company.
and,
if
i
may
interpolate
it,
northern
electric
company
is
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
the
american
telephone
and
telegraph
company,
canadian-marked
coating
company
which
is
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
the
english-canadian
mark
--
english-marked
tony
company.
and,
canadian
radio
manufacturing
company,
which
is
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
the
philips
company
of
harland,
enacted
as
licensing
agent
in
canada
for
rca
victor
company
and
hazeltine
electronics
corporation,
the
respondent
in
this
case.
the
portfolio
in
respect
of
which
crpl
had
the
right
to
grant
licenses
consisted
of
5,000
patents
and,
in
the
absence
of
a
license
from
crpl,
it
is
doubtful
if
anyone
could
sell
in
canada
a
radio
or
television
receiver.
crpl
indicated
that
it
does
not
grant
a
license
to
any
importer
of
radio
or
television
receivers
except
in
the
limited
situation
where
the
type
or
kind
of
radio
or
television
receiver
sought
to
be
imported
is
not
manufactured
by
any
radio
or
television
receiver
manufacturer
in
town.
it
is
particularly
in
respect
to
this
policy
of
crpl
in
precluding
importers
from
bringing
into
canada
radio
and
television
receivers
that
the
complaint
was
made
to
this
commission.
it
was
stated
to
be
the
policy
of
crpl
to
enforce
its
patent
right
against
any
person
who
sells
in
canada
an
imported
radio
or
television
receiver
which
infringes
any
one
or
more
of
a
patent
in
its
portfolio.
now,
how
did
they
enforce
it?
and,
the
record
is
clear
on
it.
there
isn't
any
denial.
they
had
patent
agents
and
investigators,
and
they
went
around
and
they're
shock
to
see
if
there
are
any
imported
radio
sets.
if
there
were,
they'd
turn
them
in
to
the
pool
and
the
pool,
then,
started
suits
and
most
of
the
suits,
according
to
the
documentary
evidence
coming
from
the
files
of
the
pool,
ended
in
an
agreement
by
the
distributer,
never
to
handle
a
set
again
that
was
imported
into
canada.
and,
our
res
--
and,
our
distributers
had
to
enter
into
such
agreement,
and
we
have
a
family
name
of
cosby.
documents
are
in
the
case.
he
had
to
agree
that
he
wouldn't
handle
it
unless
it
was
licensed
and
the
only
way
it
could
be
licensed,
and
we
have
our
answers
replete
with
demands
by
zenith
to
get
licenses
and
they
couldn't
get
licenses
and,
while
it's
said
that
we
didn't
formally
asked
for
a
license
after
1953,
we
had
a
lawsuit
that
ran
through
1957
which
was
designed
to
break
up
this
illegal
restriction
on
licensing
and,
and
we
did
get
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
the
pool.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
we
couldn't
ship
any
sets
up
there
that
were
licensed
because
they
said
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes,
because
they
said,
mr.
justice
black,
they
said
"you
cannot
have
a
license
from
these
5,000
patents
in
this
pool
unless
you
build
a
factory
in
canada
and
produce
your
product
there.
you
can't
produce
it
in
chicago
and
ship
it
into
canada
and
sell
it
in
our
market."
how
could
you
stop
commerce
between
countries
any
more
effectively
than
that?
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
no,
it's
not
justified
by
any
law
that
i
know
of.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
we
had
the
issue
made,
mr.
justice
black.
we
had
the
issue
made
in
the
district
court,
that
this
was
authorized
by
canadian
patent
law
and
we
tried
it
out
and
they
lost
that
issue.
and,
the
district
court
made
a
specific
finding
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
canadian
patent
law
which
justified
any
such
cite
of
a
proceeding,
and
even
if
there
has
been
and
they
could
do
it
with
their
individual
patents,
it's
elementary
that
when
they
join
in
a
conspiracy
with
our
competitors
to
use
this
as
to
stop
our
competition,
and
i'm
going
to
get
into
that
in
a
minute
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
in
canada,
yes,
but
it's
the
flow
of
commerce
from
the
united
states
into
canada
that's
being
interfered
with.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
that's
a
government
thing.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
the
government
could
do
anything
they
want,
and
i'm
not
talking
about
the
government.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
no,
this
is
not
a
government
organization.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
no,
absolutely
not.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
this
is
a
private
conspiracy.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
is
it
denied?
there's
no
proof
of
any
sec
--
(voice
overlap)
why,
of
course.
there's
no
proof
of
that.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
no
contention.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
the
view
of
the
other
side
took
wise
that
under
canadian
patent
law,
they
had
to
restrict
licenses
for
import,
otherwise,
they
encourage
different
sanctions
on
their
patent
rights.
that
was
their
contention.
now,
we
tried
it
out
on
expert
testimony
and
we
had
canadian
experts
come
down
here,
and
there
was
not
one
single
thing
to
it.
it
was
a
complete
sham
from
top
to
bottom,
and
the
district
court
so
held.
they
didn't
appeal
it.
it
didn't
have
a
--
there
was
no
issue
on
it
in
the
lower
court
and
the
appellate
court
and
they
abandoned
it
here
in
their
brief.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes.
alright,
as
i
say,
they
sent
out
these
investigators
to
scatter
out
imports
and
then
bring
suits
or
write
letters.
the
record
shows
from
their
records
there
wasn't
any
denial
to
any
of
this.
nobody
from
the
pool
ever
got
on
the
stand
on
any
issue
in
this
case.
worrying
notices
were
widely
published
in
newspapers.
the
pool
boast
newspapers
from
coast
to
coast
carry
the
commandos
total
of
4,343,084
advertising
messages
to
help
put
a
stop
to
importation
of
cheap
substandard
imported
radio
blanketed
at
the
customs.
they
were
our
potential
customers
in
canada.
then,
they
sent
out
a
warning
note
and
they
sent
one
out
just
shortly
before
the
suit
started,
and
this
was
addressed
to
importers,
vendors,
or
users
of
radio
and
television
receivers.
that's
all
people
we
could
possibly
sell
to:
an
importer,
a
vendor,
or
a
user.
that's
our
entire
market.
now,
here's
an
inducement
to
boycott
our
product
in
the
entire
country
of
canada.
we
wish
to
bring
to
your
attention
that
canadian
radio
patents
limited
is
a
central
patent
licensing
agency
administering
various
important
canadian
patents
of
invention
relating
to
radio
and
television
receivers,
and
then
they
listed
their
licensee.
of
course,
we
weren't
licensed.
so,
we
weren't
licensed.
so,
we
weren't
listed.
and
then,
they
say
"the
above
companies
our
working
the
patented
inventions
in
canada
on
a
commercial
scale
and
are
preparing
and
willing
to
meet
the
public
demand
for
the
patented
articles
in
canada
on
agreeable
terms."
now,
here
is
the
threat.
"canadian
radio
patents
desires
to
inform
importers,
vendors,
purchasers,
or
users
of
radio
and
television
receivers
which
infringe
patent
rights
owned
or
administered
by
canadian
radio
patents
limited
and
are
listed
above
that
they
will
be
held
liable
to
canadian
radio
patents
limited
on
account
of
said
infringement."
then,
they
sent
out
notices
"only
canadian
made
canadian
sold
sets
are
licensed
under
the
basic
patents
of
canadian
radio
patents
limited."
my
opponents
in
the
trial
court,
in
attempt
to
sustain
the
issue
that
mr.
justice
black
referred
to,
that
there
was
some
law
up
there
in
canada
which
would
justify
this
sort
of
comeback.
put
a
man
on
a
stand
by
the
name
of
gordon
fripp
henderson
who
was
a
member
of
a
firm
that
had
represented
this
pool
for
years
and
years
and
years.
but
just
a
minute,
before
i
get
into
that,
hazeltine
put
its
patents
in
this
pool
in
1943
without
--
with
extensions
up
until
1963,
past
the
damage
period.
i
don't
know
what's
happened
since
because
we
have
no
proofs.
they
say,
now,
they're
not
in
it
because
they've
been
enjoined.
they
say
they
filed
an
affidavit
where
they've
done
something
about
it,
but
there
is
no
injunction
now,
which
has
never
been
superseded,
to
get
out
of
the
pool.
and,
they're
pleading
here
that
because
they're
now
obeying
a
court
injunction
that
that
in
some
way
absolves
him
from
getting
into
this
pool.
but,
anyway,
they
got
into
the
pool
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
the
injunction
enjoined
them
from
staying
in
these
pools.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
united
states
district
court
in
chicago,
entered
by
judge
austin,
i
--
right
after
he
made
his
little
speech
about
the
patent
law
where
he
finally
weakened
and,
unwindless,
admitted
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
law
that
justified
their
position
and
retracted
his
whole
position.
we
went
into
the
cross-examination
of
this
witness,
who
was
the
attorney
for
the
pool
and
who'd
made
the
submission
by
the
pool
to
the
canadian
--
a
royal
canadian
commission,
thoroughly
familiar
with
all
of
it,
worked
for
him
for
years,
and
years,
and
years.
i
crossed
examined
him
and
i
want
to
read
some
of
his
cross-examination
because
it
shows
the
impact
of
this
conspiracy
and
what
it
was
intended
for,
what
it
was
intended
to
do,
and
what
had
actually
did
do
within
this
damage
period,
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
says,
as
a
matter
of
law,
can't
under
our
antitrust
laws
constituted
damage.
he
said
"my
law
firm
presented
the
submissions
on
behalf
of
canadian
radio
patents
limited
and
it
certainly
sought
to
say
that
canadian
radio
patents
limited
was
not
doing
anything
illegal."
he
said
that
part
was
submitted
on
december
31,
1959,
that's
within
our
damage
period.
question:
"now,
you
told
us
this
morning
that
you
knew
what
the
policy,
the
licensing
policy
of
canadian
radio
patents
limited
was
and
then,
as
i
understand
you
to
state
it,
the
policy
was
not
to
license
import
where
there
was
manufacturing
in
canada."
answer:
"that
is
correct."
question:
"now,
imports
that
came
in
within
the
electronics
field
would
represent
competition
to
the
owners
of
this
pool,
would
it
not?"
answer:
"certainly."
question:
"no
question
about
it
is
there?"
answer:
"i
would've
thought
not."
question:
"the
portfolio
in
respect
to
which
crpl
had
the
right
to
grant
licenses
consisted
of
5,000
patents
and,
in
the
absence
of
a
license
from
crpl,
it
is
doubtful
if
anyone
can
sell
in
canada
a
radio
or
television
receiver.
was
that
considered?"
answer:
"of
course
they
considered
it.
they
wrote
it.
they
considered
that
aspect
of
the
matter
and
they
referred
to
it
in
the
report."
and
i
said,
"well,
do
you
consider
that
a
company
like
zenith
radio
exporting
into
canada
is
competition
for
the
members
of
the
pool?"
"well,
i
didn't
get
any
answer
to
that.
so,
i
asked
him
another
question.
"and
that
would
include
zenith
radio
corporation,
wouldn't
it?"
answer:
"it
would
include
anyone
at
that
time
who
sought
to
sell
in
canada
radio
receiving
sets."
"and,
you
have
told
us
that
if
zenith
is
a
competitor
and
if
it
doesn't
manufacture,
if
there
are
manufacturers
in
canada,
then
this
pool
will
not
license
zenith
to
import
anything
into
canada.
isn't
that
right?"
answer:
"they
will
not
license."
"the
importation
into
canada,
in
respect
of
the
type
and
kind
of
television
set
or
radio
set
that
is
being
made
in
canada,
that
is
correct,
and
this
includes
home
radio
and
television
sets."
question:
"the
report
says
it
was
stated
to
be
the
policy
of
crpl
to
enforce
its
patent
right
against
any
person
who
sells
in
canada
an
imported
radio
or
television
receiver
which
infringes
any
one
or
more
of
the
patents
in
this
portfolio,
except
in
the
limited
area
where
permission
has
been
granted
to
import
the
apparatus
which
crpl
agrees
is
not
of
a
type
or
kind
made
in
this
country.
is
that
what
they
arrived
at?"
answer:
"it
so
states,
the
report
so
states."
"and,
that
was
crpl's
statement,
wasn't
it?"
answer:
"that
is
crpl
that
made
the
submission.
"that
made
the
submission
that
that
is
what
they
were
doing?"
"now,
under
that,
zenith
couldn't
get
a
license
to
import
at
all
unless
they
manufacture
up
there,
could
they?
i
am
talking
about
seeking
to
import
something
that
is
competitive
with
the
members
of
the
pool."
answer:
"and
something
that
is
being
made
in
canada?"
"yes,
by
the
pool."
answer:
"then,
their
stated
policy
is
that
they
would
not
grant
a
license
to
import."
they're
competitors.
they're
joint
shoulder-to-shoulder
with
a
great
mass
of
patents.
whether
they're
valid
or
not,
they
could
keep
the
litigation
forever
and
ever
in
forcing
those
patents.
and,
by
the
way,
the
district
court
found
that
the
instant
suit,
which
was
brought
in
a
hazeltine
patent
which
was
in
the
pool,
was
brought
pursuant
to
the
pool.
hazeltine
came
into
this
pool
in
1943.
the
record
shows
that
they
volunteered
their
patents
to
be
used
in
litigation
against
importers,
documentary
evidence.
the
record
shows
that
they
were
in
these
pools
by
their
own
admission
knowing
that
the
purpose
of
the
pool
was
to
exclude
importation.
no
question
about
it,
admitted
by
their
general
counsel
on
his
cross-examination
and
upon
his
deposition.
and,
they
said
they
were
in
the
pool,
the
canadian
pool,
and
they
intended
--
right
in
the
trial
they
said
they
were
in
the
pool
and
they
intended
to
stay
in
that
pool,
flaunted
their
participation
in
the
pool,
and
they
said
the
reason
for
it
was
to
get
more
bucks
for
hazeltine.
well,
i
suppose
every
illegal
activity
from
the
beginning
of
time
down
to
date
has
had
something
about
getting
more
bucks
or
more
money
out
of
the
illegal
activity,
and
that,
certainly,
is
no
justification
with
all
due
deference.
there
are
some
rather
interesting
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes,
right
in
the
back
of
our
brief
which
we
set
out,
and
i'll
read
it
to
your
honor.
it's
on
page
--
it's
--
this
is
the
record
i'm
reading
from.
let
me
read
it
to
you
from
the
record
which
--
it's
made
an
appendix
to
our
original
brief.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
finding
32.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
original
brief,
not
the
petition
but
the
original
brief
in
this
court.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes,
that's
it.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
the
court
held
the
proofs
established
as
a
fact
that,
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
canadian
patent
act
does
not
require
the
pool
to
refuse
to
license
importation
that's
contended
by
plaintiff,
nor
does
the
act
penalize
in
any
way
a
patentee
who
license
for
importation
whereas,
in
this
case,
there's
been
carried
on
extensive
manufacturing
in
canada
under
its
patents
rules
squarely.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
no,
not
another
thing,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
not
another
thing.
there
was
a
time
--
this
is
digression.
there
was
a
time
when
canada
restricted
imports
under
the
patent
law.
then,
they
had
a
commerce
of
the
different
countries
of
patent
companies,
and
they
all
recognize
that
they
all
had
mutual
interest
in
breaking
down
these
patent
restrictions,
which
is
restrained
trade
between
different
countries.
so,
they
changed
it
and
they
said,
under
the
congress
--
wasn't
it
congress?
congress
at
24?
well,
anyway,
there
was
a
congress
that's
in
the
record
that,
under
that
congress,
no
country
who
wanted
to
stay
at
the
time
could
put
any
restriction
on
patents
or
upon
the
import
of
goods
which
were
patented.
and,
that
was
written
in
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
to
the
canadian
patent
law,
and
the
canadian
patent
law
says
nothing
in
this
act
shall
be
construed
in
con
--
to
controvert
any
trade,
and
this
was
a
trade.
so,
it
was
clear
onto
the
path.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
no,
sir.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
for
a
year-and-a
half.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
right.
and
that
was
excluded
from
the
damages.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
that
was
excluded
from
the
damages,
and
there
are
no
damages
in
this
judgment
which
cover
any
period
where
there
was
a
government
embargo,
but
we're
not
talking
about
a
government
embargo
here,
which
i
think
your
honor
understands.
talking
about
a
private
conspiracy
designed
by
electronic
competitors
all
over
the
world.
alright,
to
go
back
to
my
lawsuit
in
chicago,
we
thought
we'd
settled
the
case
and
that
we
could
now
go
to
work
in
canada
and
develop
our
market.
that's
what
we
thought.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
that's
in
1957.
that
was
settled
in
september
9,
1957.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
of
$10
million
and
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
and
also,
the
licensing
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
by
general
electric
and
by
rca
and
by
westinghouse.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
a
patent
up
to
that
date,
not
including
colored
television.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
up
to
that
date.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
exactly
right.
so,
we
start
to
go
into
canada
and
mr.
wright
testified,
and
no
denial
of
his
testimony,
no
witness
got
up
on
the
witness
stand.
and,
they
say
we
ought
to
brought
some
distributers
in,
but
here's
something
i
want
to
bring
out
before
i
get
into
this.
there
was
a
conspiracy
within
a
conspiracy.
they
had
distributor's
organizations
up
in
canada
which
were
cooperating
hand-in-glove
with
this
pool,
and
they
comprised
the
people
you
have
to
deal
with.
when
you
sell
sets,
you
have
to
go
to
distributors.
and,
the
court
below
criticizes
us
because
we
didn't
bring
in
distributors.
the
distributors
were
all
banning
against
us,
and
the
record
shows,
by
documentary
evidence
of
their
minutes,
where
they're
trying
to
cooperate
with
the
pool
and
say
"tell
us
what
we
can
do.
tell
us
what
we
can
do
to
help
you
and
stop
the
import
of
american
products
into
canada."
they
were
all
in
it.
so,
when
we
go
up
there,
mr.
wright
testified
and
there's
no
denial
of
its
testimony,
and
they
tried
to
impugn
its
testimony
and
i've
seen
some
funny
things
in
lawsuits
but
never
in
my
life
have
i
seen
witnesses
attempted
to
be
impugned
by
documents
which
are
not
in
the
evidence,
which
were
never
even
presented
until
a
year
after
the
case
had
been
tried
where
no
ef
--
no
chance
has
ever
been
made
to
meet
any
of
the
documents
which
they
claim
impeach
mr.
wright's
testimony.
in
other
words,
ordinarily,
cases
are
tried
on
a
record
made
in
the
trial
court
and,
here,
they
come
in
with
pages
of
offers
of
proof
with
new
counsel,
trying
to
get
a
new
grasp
of
the
case
a
year
after
it's
been
tried
and
the
trial
court
said
that
that
--
these
things
all
were
available
at
the
trial.
why
weren't
they
produced?
no
excuse
given.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes,
the
findings
had
all
been
made.
the
case
had
been
put
to
bed
and
a
year
had
gone,
and
they
come
in
with
new
counsel
with
this
new
attempt
to
try
the
case
all
over
again,
and
the
district
court
wouldn't
do
it
and
rightly
sought
the
matter
of
discretion
with
the
district
court
whether
to
reopen
the
case.
and,
the
new
evidence
rule
is
conclusive
on
all
the
sellers,
whatever
it
was,
was
available
at
the
time
of
the
trial
and
never
produced
until
a
year
after
the
trial.
and
then,
it's
largely
counsel's
statements
and
what
they
would
do
and
what
they
wouldn't.
i
mean,
ordinary
cases
are
tried
on
the
records
made
at
the
trial.
this
is
an
exception,
apparently.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes,
i
am.
i
certainly
am,
but
i'm
getting
to
the
question
now
of
the
fact
of
damages.
and,
the
fact
of
damage,
the
way
the
courts
have
been
construing
it,
and
i
say
that
was
always
done,
but
the
fact
of
damage
is
the
foundation
and
you
start
from
there
with
the
proof
of
the
actual
damage.
what
was
the
fact
of
damage?
the
fact
of
damage,
number
one,
we
didn't
have
any
licenses
on
pool
patents.
number
two,
everybody
in
that
trade
for
years,
since
1926
at
least,
had
been
conditioned
to
the
fact
that,
without
a
pool
license,
anybody
who
handle
sets
was
subject
to
suit,
was
subject
to
harassment,
was
subject
to
letters
being
sent
out
to
the
potential
customers,
not
only
of
ours
but
of
the
distributors
themselves,
the
user.
they
were
published
in
the
trade
papers.
they
were
published
in
the
press.
it
was
inducement
to
boycott
an
entire
market.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
against
us.
the
suit
from
chicago
was
filed
pursuant
to
this.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
infringement
suit,
yes,
on
a
patent
in
the
pool.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
no,
it
was
the
court
--
the
trial
court
held
it
was
pursuant
to
this
conspiracy
and
it
was
admitted.
i'm
going
to
get
to
that
after
the
luncheon
break.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
not
now.
we
did.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
years
ago,
in
1949
or
1959.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
we
had
no
tax
from
hazeltine.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
claiming
infringement
on
a
patent
which
was
in
the
canadian
pool.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
in
this
country
only.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
after
the
1957
settlement,
as
i
said
this
morning,
the
zenith
company
undertook
to
go
into
the
canadian
market
with
their
radio
and
television
sets.
now,
here
are
two
contiguous
markets,
canada
and
united
states,
fighting
alongside
each
other
so
far
as
the
boring
areas
are
concerned,
canadian
listeners
can
pick
up
broadcast
from
television
and
radio
along
the
border
of
american
stations.
there's
no
difference
in
the
sets.
they
had
the
same
lines.
they
had
the
same
cycles.
testimony
was
that
the
two
products
--
of
the
two
products,
that
the
american
product
was
far
superior
than
to
the
canadian
product,
that
the
contiguous
markets
had
essentially
the
same
competition,
although
there
was
more
competition
in
the
united
states
market
than
there
was
in
united
states.
mr.
wright
testified
that
he
went
up
there
and
tried
to
establish
distribution
in
that
market.
there
was
a
ready
demand
for
a
product,
survey
had
shown
that,
and
he
couldn't
find
distributors.
distributors,
as
i
pointed
out
this
morning,
were
in
these
associations.
we
have
the
minutes
of
some
of
their
meetings
tied
up
with
the
pool.
he
couldn't
get
distributors
for
the
reason
that
they
had
been
conditioned
like
pablo's
dog
for
years
and
years
to
the
sounding
of
the
gong
of
the
canadian
radio
patents,
the
threat
the
constant
inherent
threat
against
everybody
in
the
trade
with
the
warning
notices,
with
the
investigations,
with
the
lawsuits,
and
that
was
the
market.
and,
the
pool
was
there,
still
in
existence,
run
by
a
general
electric
even
though
the
government
had
started
the
suit
against
them
and
had
gotten
a
consent
decree
whereby
three
of
the
conspiring
companies
had
agreed
to
license
their
sets
without
importation
which,
by
the
way,
negative
any
thought
that
there
was
anything
in
canadian
law
that
would
prevent
them
from
licensing
for
importation,
but
permitted
the
general
electric
company
to
continue
to
run
that
pool
and
general,
i
think,
continued
to
run
the
pool
with
a
permitted
organization,
managers,
investigators,
and
what
have
you.
so,
mr.
wright
testified
that
he
couldn't
get
distribution,
the
kind
of
distribution
to
which
a
product
of
zenith
was
entitled
to
in
a
market.
and,
the
reason
he
couldn't
get
it
was
because
of
the
threats
of
the
pool
against
the
potential
distributors
which
he
tried
to
get.
he
said
he
could
get
some
distribution
in
the
western
provinces
where
there
are
very
sparse
settlements
out
there
and
some
in
the
maritime
province.
but,
along
the
contiguous
territories,
he
couldn't
get
them.
so,
he
had
to
use
the
hearing
aid
distributor.
we
had
a
hearing
aid
distributor.
that's
another
product
of
zenith.
we
had
a
canadian
zenith
which
distributed
hearing
aids
and
he
used
them
to
try
and
build
up
some
distribution.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
we
didn't
have
them,
and
i'm
coming
to
that
in
just
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
right.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
that's
right,
and
i'm
going
to
get
right
to
that.
how
--
i'll
show,
your
honor,
why
and
how
and
the
effect
of
not
having
them
is.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
1959-1963,
may
of
1959
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
so,
he
couldn't
get
distributors
so
he
had
to
use
his
hearing
aid
distributors.
and,
even
under
that
impediment,
he
was
able
to
sell
some
sets
by
5%
of
the
market,
the
proof
show,
as
against
20%
which
zenith
was
selling
in
the
united
states.
where
90
more
had
gotten
on
their
way
up
there
then
a
man
by
the
name
of
bryan
mcconnell,
no
relation
to
mine,
he
ran
the
pool.
he
was
an
employee
of
general
electric.
he
ran
the
pool
and
he
came
to
mr.
kellee
arts,
manager
of
our
hearing
aid
company,
and
he
said
"what
are
you
doing
here?
are
you
going
to
manufacture
in
canada?
you
can't
import
sets
in
here
because
we
know
that
you
got
some
licenses
under
your
settlement
in
1957,
but
we
have
other
patents
which
you're
controlling.
we
have
marconi
patents,
we
have
hazeltine
patents,
we
have
philips
patents,
and
they
can't
be
licensed
for
import.
you
have
to
manufacture
in
canada."
no
dispute
to
that
congress
sanction.
mcconnell
doesn't
deny
it.
nobody
denies
it.
it's
a
merit
on
this
record
that
that's
what
he
told
us
and
that
"we
want
diagrams
of
your
sets
to
examine,"
and
we
gave
them
to
him
and
he
took
them
home
and
then
he
came
back
and
he
said
"you
are
infringing
these
patents,"
and
he
sent
us
a
notice
within
the
damage
period
in
which
he,
with
regular
notice,
threaten
the
suit.
"you
are
infringing
the
patent."
that's
the
way
you
start
an
infringement
suit,
names
the
patents,
and
then
encloses
a
pool
license
which
is
limited
to
manufacture
in
canada.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes,
we
went
in
but
we
only
made
5%,
and
the
court
of
appeals
below
seems
to
think
that
there
must
be
a
total
exclusion
from
a
market.
we're
saying
that
the
impedimenta
of
the
pool
and
the
effect
that's
it
had
to
create
boycotts
of
our
product
during
the
damage
period
was
impedimenta
which
we
were
faced
continuously,
cumulatively,
as
this
court
said
in
the
united
shoe
machinery
case.
and,
true,
we
could've
sued
back
in
1957
as
they
said
--
this
court
said
in
the
shoe
machinery
case
but
we
could
still
sue
in
1959.
if
the
effect
of
this
illegal
conspiracy,
which
haven't
been
terminated,
which
is
still
existing,
which
is
still
continuing,
which
is
still
going
forth,
and
the
threat
inherent
to
the
whole
trade
and
known
to
the
whole
trade,
and
the
type
was
serious.
the
testimony
is
that,
under
canadian
patent
law,
any
distributor
could
have
all
of
the
product
confiscated
by
the
owner
of
the
patents.
he
couldn't
sell
them
because
he
didn't
have
a
license
to
sell
them.
we
took
that
risk
and
we
took
that
risk,
mr.
justice
white,
relying
on
the
enforcement
of
the
antitrust
laws
of
this
federal
government
on
my
advice.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
exactly,
and
we
have
testimony
and
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
right.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
wright's
testimony
wasn't
denied.
kaplan
testified
the
same
way.
it
wasn't
denied.
nobody
from
the
pool
came
in
and
said
we
could
get
distributors,
nobody.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
we
are
a
competitor
beautifully
equipped
to
compete.
that's
the
rule
that's
been
laid
down
in
the
antitrust
cases.
are
we
dealing
with
a
competitor
equipped
to
compete?
and,
we
were.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
no,
we
couldn't
get
the
distribution
system
because
of
an
illegal
conspiracy,
and
that's
what
we're
complaining
about,
one
of
the
things.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
no,
because
we
were
threaten
with
infringement
suits
on
every
single
set
we
sold,
and
we
have
sold
--
i
don't
know
how
many
sets.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes,
but
the
potential
liability
still
exists.
we
could
be
sued
on
--
for
the
profit
on
every
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
exactly,
by
mr.
wright.
he
said
he
didn't
dare
develop
it
to
sense.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
to
some
extent,
yes,
trying
to
preserve
what
market
he
had
and,
by
the
way,
it's
grown
under
the
protection
of
the
corporate
decree
in
the
district
court
to
$14
million
a
year,
corroborating
the
testimony
of
mr.
wright
and
mr.
kaplan.
now,
i
want
to
go
back
for
a
moment.
23
years
ago,
i
appeared
before
this
court
in
the
so-called
bigelow
case.
it
involved
jackson
park
theatre
in
chicago,
and
we
had
a
jury
verdict
and
it
went
up
on
appeal
to
the
same
court
of
appeals
in
the
seventh
circuit.
and,
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
only
method
of
proving
damages
is
to
compare
an
open
market
for
the
close
market
and,
for
a
quarter
of
the
sensory,
the
motion
picture
industry
had
destroyed
an
open
market
in
chicago.
there
was
no
such
comparison.
and
so,
obviously,
nobody
could've
made
that
kind
of
proof.
so,
the
card
held
that
there
was
no
fact
of
damage
and
reversed
the
case
and
came
up
here
by
certiorari.
and
this
court,
in
that
case,
said
that
where
wrongdoers,
violators
of
the
act
have
destroyed
an
open
market
comparison,
estimates
can
be
used.
and,
in
that
case,
the
only
evidence
we
had
was
the
estimate
of
our
theater
manager.
that,
absent
the
restrictions
of
the
conspiracy,
we
could've
done
as
much
business
as
a
competing
theater.
and,
the
court
held
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes,
and
we
have
an
open
market
in
the
united
states
which
is
contiguous
with
the
canadian
market
which
is
comparable
in
all
respects
as
to
competition,
as
to
markets,
as
to
broadcast,
and
all
the
rest,
and
to
compare
one
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
some
of
them
have
gone
in
and
some
of
them
have
failed,
but
the
point
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
white,
is
whether
or
not
we
can
be
compelled
to
exceed
to
stopping
commerce.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
there's
no
such
evidence
in
this
record.
there's
no
such
contention
made
in
this
record.
nobody
got
into
the
witness
stand
and
said
"if
you
build
a
plant
up
there,
you
couldn't
have
gotten
more
than
5%."
no
countervailing
evidence
to
ours.
the
cases
say,
"why,
sure
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
on
the
estimate
that's
made
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
not
in
this
record,
there
isn't.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
well,
the
evidence
that's
available,
and
there
is
some
inferences
on
the
evidence.
there's
the
testimony
of
mr.
kaplan
that
he
made
a
survey
and
found
it
was
absolutely
utterly
uneconomical
to
produce
sets
in
canada
with
canadian
labor
and
all
the
rest
of
it,
and
there
was
other
evidence
that
three
companies
that
went
in
there
and
tried
it
failed.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
i
run
it
for
me
because
why
should
we
be
compelled
to
go
into
canada
in
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws?
we
have
the
protection
of
these
laws,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
well,
may
be
so,
your
honor,
but
the
court
below,
the
district
court,
and
the
courts
of
appeals
have
said
this
time
and
time
again,
and
you
said
it
in
this
court
in
the
bigelow
case,
the
weight
of
the
testimony
of
this
kind
is
for
the
district
court,
not
to
be
weighed
on
some
suppositation
--
supposititious
case
of
--
but,
with
all
due
deference
now,
i'm
not
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
or
that's
a
difference
of
opinion,
too.
well,
i
have
one
further
contention
to
make.
my
time
is
running
out.
we
show
by
the
inference
in
transposing
it,
and
bear
in
mind,
mr.
justice
white,
that
there
was
no
objection
to
the
inference.
the
computations
came
in
without
objection.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
19
million,
trebled.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
treble,
yes.
the
third
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
no,
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
no.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
they
don't
get
to
that
question
because
there
is
no
fact
of
damage,
and
without
a
fact
of
damage
we
don't
get
to
bigelow
or
any
other.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
solely
either
actual
or
threatened.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
right,
no
holding
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
right.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
and
that
is
important.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
no,
it
rests
on
the
testimony
of
mr.
wright
--
joseph
wright
who
was
the
partner
of
mr.
sam
kaplan
who,
at
that
time,
was
training.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes,
knowing
all
the
factors,
there's
what
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
the
basis
of
their
testimony
was
that
the
markets
were
contiguous,
that
the
markets
were
essentially
their
claim,
that
the
advertising
in
the
united
states
overlapped
into
canada,
created
a
market
for
our
product,
that
the
competition
was
comparable,
that
our
sets
were
better,
that
the
shipping
problems
and
terriers
were
not
involved.
they
took
them
all
into
consideration
and,
on
the
basis
of
that
and
with
--
kaplan
with
40
years
in
the
business
and
wright,
too,
with
20-something,
testified
from
their
knowledge
that
they
could've
have
done
it
and
could've
gotten
the
same
share
and
there
was
no
cross-examination
and
there
was
no
other
witness
who
testified
any
different.
and,
the
testimony
stands
uncontradicted
on
the
record
and
the
trial
court
adopted
it.
let
me
turn
to
9
--
finding
number
36,
which
is
found
on
the
back
of
the
brief.
the
foreign
commerce
of
finding
--
the
foreign
commerce
of
zenith
in
--
has
been
drastically
curtailed
by
the
patent
pools
in
england,
canada,
and
australia.
the
damages
zenith
has
sustained
were
estimated
by
experienced
officials
of
zenith,
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
business
problems
and
sales
potentials
in
the
markets
involved.
they
determine
the
approximate
damages
sustained
by
a
thorough
of
each
of
the
markets
involved
and
all
relevant
factors
including
terrier,
shipping
costs,
manufacturing
problems.
zenith's
foreign
commerce
has
been
damaged
by
the
pools
in
the
following
amounts
during
the
four-year
statutory
damage
period.
now,
that
was
based
upon
the
same
kind
of
testimony
that
this
court
unequivocally
said
was
proper
in
the
bigelow
case
and
other
cases
since
have
said
whatever
its
weight
may
be,
it's
competent.
and,
it
came
in
without
any
objection.
nobody
objected.
nobody
objected
to
the
computations.
nobody
put
on
any
countervailing
evidence.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
well,
i
can't
answer
your
honor's
question
because
i
have
no
comprehension
of
how
the
court
could
vote
on
this
record
that
there
was
no
fact
of
damage,
or
not
even
a
threat
of
damage.
i
just
don't
understand
it,
to
be
perfectly
candid
and
frank
with
the
court.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
in
part.
it
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
but,
on
the
pools,
it
completely
reversed
it.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes,
gave
us
no
protection
at
all.
now,
here
we
fill
up,
under
the
protection
of
this
injunction,
a
business
of
$14
million,
which
approximates
what
--
and
corroborates
what
the
estimates
were
that
were
made
by
our
officials.
the
consequence,
and
i
can't
understate
this,
the
consequence
of
sustaining
of
taking
away
our
protection
from
this
injunction
is
that
we
can
be
sued
on
every
single
set
we've
ever
sold
under
the
pool
patent
and
we
are
subject
to
a
potential
liability
of
any
profit
that
we
made
on
those
sets
and
we
can
be
forever
barred
from
that
market,
and
here
are
set
three
companies.
we,
to
see
what
this
court
--
we've
taken
$10
million
from
the
bank
in
1957
and
they
wait
to
see
who
is
going
to
get
the
business
that
zenith
has
developed
in
canada.
and
if
that
isn't
a
threat,
i
mean,
i
should
never
have
started
to
practice
law
if
i
gave
it
up
at
the
beginning.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes,
it's
in
the
record
because
we
attached
it
to
our
brief
as
public
record
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
which
this
court
takes
judicial
notice
of.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
they're
a
part
of
it,
yes.
the
colored
television
market,
they
said,
and
i'm
not
an
expert
on
the
patents,
but
they
said
they
have
nine
colored
television
patents
which
control
the
markets
of
the
free
world
and
they're
all
in
the
pool.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
you
could
take
judicial
notice,
but
you
might
also,
with
all
due
deference,
take
judicial
notice
of
a
statement
in
those
reports
that
they
have
been
--
zenith
has
been
restricted
in
these
markets
by
restrictions
of
these
pools
and
that
they
are
trying
their
best
to
fight
out
from
under
them
but,
so
far,
they
haven't
been
able
to
do
it.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
well,
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
the
reason
that
i
have
to
take
the
position
that
i
took
with
justice
fortas
is
this
record
is
closed.
there's
no
other
way
to
show
what
happens
there,
no
other
way.
this
situation
your
honor
is
talking
about,
they
came
in
a
year
after
the
case
is
tried
with
these
reports.
we
are
to
have
no
chance
to
answer
the
reports
or
to
explain
who
wrote
them
or
anything
else
about
it.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
what?
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
i
mean,
they
were
--
they're
not
conclusive
on
anything.
they're
one
out
of
the
evidence
which
never
got
into
the
record.
i
have
a
little
time
left
which
i'm
going
to
reserve
if
i
may.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
pardon
me.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
members
of
the
court.
i
represent
the
zenith
radio
corporation
which
is
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
respondents
are
the
hazeltine
research,
inc.,
a
corporation
which
is
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
the
hazeltine
corporation.
and,
it
was
stipulated
by
the
parties
in
this
case
in
a
pretrial
stipulation
that,
for
all
purposes
in
this
lawsuit
and
all
purposes
in
the
instant
case,
that
the
two
corporations
should
be
considered
one
and
the
same.
the
instant
suit
was
brought
for
the
alleged
infringement
of
a
patent,
a
monochrome
patent
alleged
to
have
been
infringed
by
the
zenith
corporation.
and,
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
below,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
that
patent
was
invalid
and
not
infringed.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
i'm
going
to
reach
that
in
the
course
of
my
argument.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
there
is
that
issue,
your
honor.
i
simply
made
a
statement
because
--
as
part
of
the
facts
in
the
case
that
there
was
that
pretrial
stipulation
and
i'm
treating,
for
this
portion
of
the
argument,
the
two
corporations
as
the
same.
in
that
suit,
zenith
answered
by
setting
up
the
patent
and
other
patents
of
hazeltine
have
been
misused
by
putting
them
into
foreign
patent
pools,
which
foreign
patent
pools
had
refused
to
license
imports
and
had
restricted
commerce
between
united
states
and
foreign
countries,
namely
canada,
england,
and
australia,
contrary
to
the
provisions
of
the
antitrust
law,
the
federal
antitrust
law
that
any
restriction
or
any
combination,
conspiracy,
or
arrangement
between
competitors
which
restrain
commerce
not
only
between
the
states
of
the
united
states
but
between
the
comp
--
the
country
of
the
united
states
and
foreign
countries,
violated
section
4
of
the
clayton
act,
sections
1
and
2
of
the
sherman
act.
and,
under
those
two
sections,
also
section
16
of
the
clayton
act,
alleging
the
same
facts
as
we'd
set
up
in
the
mis
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
i
was
taking
the
task
by
mr.
chadwell
for
not
mentioning
england,
but
i
ran
out
of
time.
i
mean,
i
had
to
choose
something
to
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
i
will,
your
honor.
after
this
case
had
been
submitted,
and
we've
heard
about
the
findings
being
entered,
hazeltine
entered
the
findings.
they
presented
complete
findings
of
every
aspect
in
this
case.
and,
in
those
findings,
time
after
time
after
time,
they
asked
the
trial
court
to
approve
hazeltine
corporation's
entry
into
the
pools,
the
use
of
their
patents
in
the
pools,
that
there
was
no
illegal
use
of
hazeltine
corporation's
patents,
foreign
patents,
and
hazeltine
research,
inc.
had
no
foreign
patents.
they
were
the
patents
of
hazeltine
corporation.
if
they
had
entered
those
findings,
i
couldn't
have
said
one
single
word
about
their
not
being
res
judicata.
i
was
there.
they
presented
them.
we'd
stipulated
that
the
companies
were
the
same
and
they
were
there
asking
for
relief
from
that
court,
and
it
was
owned.
you
talk
about
the
findings
being
written,
but
they
wrote
findings.
the
court
asked
both
sides
to
present
findings.
they
wrote
them.
we
wrote
them.
and,
the
court
entered
our
findings
and
it's
done
and
approved
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
seventh
circuit.
further
than
that,
all
of
their
officials
were
there
during
the
whole
course
of
the
trial
and
knew
that
the
two
companies
were
stipulated
to
be
one
and
the
same,
and
that
hazeltine
was
there.
their
counsel
for
the
parent
cor
--
company
trying
to
justify
their
participation
in
these
pools,
trying
to
get
a
complete
bill
of
health
from
the
district
court
on
their
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
and,
there
isn't
the
slightest
question
in
the
world
about
that
and
the
rule
is
that
a
party
that
comes
in
and
asks
relief
from
a
court
submits
itself
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
not
only
that,
this
isn't
a
case
where
a
judgment
was
entered
against
somebody
who
wasn't
there,
off
in
a
left
field
somewhere.
they
came
into
the
court
before
a
judgment
was
entered
and
they
raised
the
contention
that
we're
not
bound
by
what's
going
on
in
this
court,
and
they
raised
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
submission
that
these
findings
brought
them
into
the
case.
and,
they
lost
on
that
issue
and
the
district
court
said
they
were
in
the
case.
true,
he
referred
to
the
stipulation,
but
here
we
were
dealing
with
a
situation
in
the
stipulation.
and,
why
was
the
stipulation
entered?
we
don't
have
to
speculate
about
it.
they
presented
a
stipulation
in
which
they
said,
for
the
purposes
of
this
suit,
these
two
companies
are
to
be
considered
the
same,
and
why?
they
spelled
it
out,
to
avoid
the
necessity
of
looking
through
the
corporate
veil
from
the
subsidiary
to
the
parent.
that
was
why.
so,
he
wouldn't
have
to
go
into
the
--
i
could've
made
the
proof
that
they
were
--
one
was
the
agent
of
the
other.
one
was
the
alter
ego
of
the
other.
no
problem
of
proof,
they
were
there.
this
isn't
a
case
where
you're
trying
to
hold
somebody
who
wasn't
there.
thank
you.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
i
represent
the
zenith
radio
corporation
which
is
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
respondents
are
the
hazeltine
research,
inc.,
a
corporation
which
is
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
the
hazeltine
corporation.
and,
it
was
stipulated
by
the
parties
in
this
case
in
a
pretrial
stipulation
that,
for
all
purposes
in
this
lawsuit
and
all
purposes
in
the
instant
case,
that
the
two
corporations
should
be
considered
one
and
the
same.
the
instant
suit
was
brought
for
the
alleged
infringement
of
a
patent,
a
monochrome
patent
alleged
to
have
been
infringed
by
the
zenith
corporation.
and,
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
below,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
that
patent
was
invalid
and
not
infringed.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
i'm
going
to
reach
that
in
the
course
of
my
argument.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
there
is
that
issue,
your
honor.
i
simply
made
a
statement
because
--
as
part
of
the
facts
in
the
case
that
there
was
that
pretrial
stipulation
and
i'm
treating,
for
this
portion
of
the
argument,
the
two
corporations
as
the
same.
in
that
suit,
zenith
answered
by
setting
up
a
patent
and
other
patents
of
hazeltine
have
been
misused
by
putting
them
into
foreign
patent
pools,
which
foreign
patent
pools
had
refused
to
license
imports
and
had
restricted
commerce
between
united
states
and
foreign
countries,
namely
canada,
england,
and
australia,
contrary
to
the
provisions
of
the
antitrust
law,
the
federal
antitrust
law
that
any
restriction
or
any
combination,
conspiracy,
or
arrangement
between
competitors
which
restrain
commerce
not
only
between
the
states
of
the
united
states
but
between
the
comp
--
the
country
of
the
united
states
and
foreign
countries,
violated
section
4
of
the
clayton
act,
sections
1
and
2
of
the
sherman
act.
and,
under
those
two
sections,
also
section
16
of
the
clayton
act,
alleging
the
same
facts
as
we'd
set
up
in
the
misused
answer
we
filed
in
counterclaim
and,
in
that
counterclaim,
asked
for
travel
damages
and
asked
for
an
injunction
against
the
activities
of
these
foreign
patent
tools.
after
a
trial
and
findings
of
fact
in
detail
made
by
the
district
court,
a
judgment
was
entered
on
april
5,
1965
pursuant
to
rule
54
(b)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
for
damages
which
have
been
occasioned
by
the
plaintiff
or
by
the
counterclaim
in
the
amount
of
$19,042,173
for
the
loss
of
sales
and
profits
in
the
canadian
market
in
the
sale
of
home
receiving
sets
in
television
and
radio.
at
the
time
the
findings
came
down,
hazeltine
obtained
new
counsel
and
came
in
and
made
various
motions
which
are
discussed
in
the
briefs,
purport
of
which
was
to
reopen
the
case
on
evidence
which
was
available
at
the
time
of
the
trial
and
for
further
proceedings
on
the
claim
that
there
were
embargoes
imposed
by
the
government
as
opposed
to
private
patent
pools
and
conspiracies
in
england
and
australia.
and,
for
that
limited
purpose,
the
case
was
reopened
and
after
further
hearing,
on
december
13,
1965,
the
trial
court
awarded
petitioner
trouble
damages
in
the
amount
of
$15,919,458
for
loss
of
sales
and
profits
in
england
and
australia
during
the
damage
period.
in
the
first
judgment,
an
injunction
was
added
against
the
continuance
by
the
respondent
companies
and
these
pools
for
putting
their
patents
in
the
pools
or
in
any
way
furthering
the
activities
of
these
pools,
and
this
is
important.
no
supercedias
was
ever
foiled
to
that
judgment,
even
though
there
was
an
appeal,
and
since
that
first
judgment
was
entered
on
april
15,
19
--
or
april
5,
1965,
zenith
has
been
operating
under
the
protection
of
the
injunction
of
the
united
states
district
court
in
their
activities
in
kent.
on
appeal
or
in
entering
the
last
judgment
after
the
trial
court
had
heard
all
the
evidence
that
was
produced
on
the
original
trial
press,
all
of
the
different
matters
which
were
urged
and
argued
in
a
three
or
four-day
hearing
on
the
motions
to
reopen
the
case
and
after
hearing
everything
that
was
submitted
in
the
case,
trial
court
made
this
comment,
"there
could
be
no
question
in
my
mind
that
zenith
suffered
damages
during
the
damage
period
by
a
virtue
of
the
pools
which
i
have
found
and,
reiterate,
existed
at
the
time
of
the
damage
period."
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
both
the
judgments
on
the
ground
that
there
is
no
substantial
evidence
in
this
record
that
zenith
was
injured
by
the
activities
of
these
pools
in
its
business
or
property,
and
held
as
a
matter
of
law
that,
on
this
record,
zenith
was
not
even
threatened
with
injury
by
the
activities
of
these
pools.
now,
the
proof
of
injury
to
zenith's
business
in
canada
was,
in
a
large
part,
documentary
and
i'm
going
into
it
in
some
detail
in
the
course
of
this
argument,
and
was
not
denied
by
any
single
witness
or
document
in
this
case.
so,
it
is
my
submission
to
this
court
that
what
is
presented
is
whether
on
admitted
facts,
which
we
claim
in
the
district
court,
found
was
unequivocal
in
its
proof
of
actual
substantial
damage
to
the
zenith
corporation,
whether
under
those
admitted
facts,
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
federal
antitrust
laws,
namely
1
and
2
of
the
sherman
act
and
4
and
16
of
the
clayton
act,
do
not
reach
and
have
no
sanction
which
will
stop
that
country.
now,
before
going
to
the
individual
markets,
i
want
to
--
if
the
court
will
bear
with
me,
i
want
to
take
just
a
few
minutes
to
give
some
of
the
background
of
this
conspiracy.
and,
this
court
in
1962
and
in
subsequent
cases
has
held,
namely
in
the
continental
ore
case,
that
conspiracies
which
are
designed
to
control
a
complete
market
and
which
are
put
together
by
competitors
to
exclude
competition
permanent
should
not
be
judged
by
taking
particular
parts
of
the
proofs
and
examining
them
and
passing
on
to
something
else,
but
that
the
proof
should
be
looked
at
as
a
whole
and,
in
the
continental
ore
case,
that
it
was
highly
relevant
to
go
back
and
look
at
the
proofs
at
the
inception
of
the
conspiracy
and
the
proofs
out
of
which
the
conspiracy
was
created
to
show
its
intendment,
its
purpose,
its
effect,
and
its
result.
now,
i've
been
in
this
litigation
with
these
pools
on
behalf
of
zenith
since
1953
and
i'm
not
going
to
refer
any
of
my
own
personal
knowledge.
everything
i'm
going
to
tell
this
court
with
reference
to
the
beginning
is
in
this
record.
and,
may
i
say
at
the
threshold
of
this
case,
the
documentary
evidence
in
this
case
came
in
by
a
pretrial
stipulation
without
any
objection
that
documents
as
to
their
varied,
all
admitted,
no
objection
to
them
whatever,
no
contravening
evidence
of
any
kind,
and
some
of
it
and
most
of
it
and
the
part
i'm
now
going
to
talk
about,
put
in
by
my
opponents
in
the
trial
court.
from
1919
until
1935,
through
some-50
cross
licensing
agreements,
the
leading
electronic
companies
of
the
world
divided
up
the
markets
of
the
world,
i'm
leaving
out
the
iron
curtain
countries.
i'm
talking
now
about
the
free
world
countries
where
competition
is
possible.
among
those
companies
were
the
telephone
companies:
the
westinghouse
company,
rca,
general
electric
company,
english
electric
company,
the
telefunken
company,
the
general
electric
company
of
germany,
gts,
the
french
company,
standard
cables
and
wireless,
the
australian
company,
and
the
philips
company
of
harland
which
we
find
everywhere
which
is
the
largest
electronics
company
and
probably
the
largest
aggregation
of
capital
and
business
in
the
entire
world.
now,
all
of
these
companies
shoulder-to-shoulder
and
by
cross
licensing
agreement
divided
the
free
world
up
into
markets
and
part
of
that
was
the
north
american
continent
which
was
assigned
to
the
so-called
radio
group.
and,
the
radio
group
was
composed
of
the
telephone
company,
that's
american
telephone
and
telegraph
company,
general
electric,
rca,
the
westinghouse
company,
and
the
philips
company.
zenith
came
into
conflict
and
confrontation
with
this
worldwide
conspiracy
when,
in
1933,
rca
with
10,000
patents
in
the
pool
which
was
composed
of
patents
contributed
by
all
the
companies
that
i
have
now
mentioned,
some-10,000
of
them,
asserted
them
against
zenith
and
demanded
that
we
take
a
license.
and,
we
took
the
position
and
said
so
in
our
pleadings
which
are
in
this
case
that
the
whole
industry
in
the
united
states
had
paid
tribute
to
this
pool
for
years
and
$1,300,000.00
or
so
have
been
paid
in
tribute
to
the
pool,
that
the
pools
were
illegal
and
we
filed
a
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
down
in
delaware
asking
for
a
determination
that
the
pools
were
illegal,
and
the
case
was
before
judge
leigh,
now
dead.
immediately,
the
pool
countered
with
63
patent
suits
against
us
in
that
proceeding.
parenthetically,
we
got
the
trial
and
one
of
them,
it
took
18
months
to
try
it.
if
we
tried
them
all,
there
wouldn't
have
been
a
lawyer
left
alive
who'd
ever
had
any
connection
with
the
case.
they
countered
out
of
that
suit
by
suing
zenith
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
chicago
on
two
patents:
the
telephone
company,
rca
and
general
electric.
and,
in
that
suit,
zenith
counterclaimed
and
set
up
a
suit
for
trouble
damages
claiming
that
they
had
been
excluded
from
the
market
in
canada
and
couldn't
sell
their
goods
there
because
of
the
pool
which
was
part
of
the
overall
conspiracy,
the
pool
known
as
canadian
radio
patents
limited.
that
suit
got
down
to
trial
that
they
go
to
trial
on
september
9,
1957.
the
sunday
before
it
went
to
trial,
the
parties
settled
the
case
by
paying
zenith
$10
million,
giving
zenith
the
patent
rights
inventing
these
black
and
white
monochrome
patents
in
all
markets
and
in
the
--
and,
the
suit
down
at
delaware
was
dismissed
upon
there
and,
in
effect,
dedicate
the
patents,
10,000
of
them,
to
the
train.
now,
i
brought
that
in
for
a
purpose
because
zenith
is
represented
here
as,
in
some
way,
taking
advantage
of
the
antitrust
laws
when,
i
submit,
on
the
entire
record,
they
have
done
very
constructive
service
under
the
antitrust
laws,
and
they
free
the
entire
american
market
so
that,
from
that
time
on,
and
the
relevance
of
this
is
on
the
damage
proof
that
from
that
time
on,
we
had
a
free
market
in
united
states.
and,
with
a
free
market,
zenith
came
from
a
little
small
company
hardly
known
to
the
leading
company
in
television
and,
i
think,
the
second
or
third
producer
in
the
united
states
in
radio.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
no.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
well,
i
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
i
haven't
been
frank
with
your
honor
entirely.
i
believe
that
hazeltine
was
named,
if
not
in
the
pleading,
certainly
in
the
proofs
as
a
co-conspirator.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
no.
there
is
no
such
evidence
in
this
record.
there
is
no
release
in
this
record.
there
is
some
settlement
papers
in
this
record
put
in
by
my
opponents,
not
me.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
there
is
an
issue
in
dispute
on
that,
first,
as
to
the
fact.
i
don't
agree
that
any
release
ever
released
hazeltine.
definitely,
i
do
not.
secondly,
no
release
was
ever
pleaded
in
this
case
and
no
release
was
ever
mentioned
in
this
case
until
one
year
after
the
case
had
been
tried,
at
which
time,
they
came
in
with
an
offer
of
proof
of
a
release.
now,
we
cited
cases
in
our
brief
that
under
rule
8,
i
believe,
and
15,
affirmative
defenses
have
to
be
pleaded
in
a
case
so
the
party
opposed
can
meet
them.
and,
no
such
plea
was
made.
the
case
wasn't
tried
on
any
release
theory.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
you
do.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
exactly.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
i
say,
further
than
that,
not
only
does
it
not
release
hazeltine
but
it
isn't
even
an
issue
in
the
case,
except
brought
in
later
by
offers
of
proof,
alright.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
under
the
rules,
your
honor,
under
the
federal
rules
unless
an
affirmative
defense
is
pleaded
during
the
trial,
so
you
could
meet
it.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
during
the
trial
or
so
close
to
it
that
the
parties
are
there
trying
their
lawsuit.
it's
waived,
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
seventh
circuit
has
handed
down
three
cases
that
says
even
a
court
can't
relieve
them
of
the
waiver.
there's
nothing
that
can
be
done.
they've
waived
it,
and
the
reason
for
it
is
we
try
our
lawsuit
on
the
pleadings
and
we
go
in
there.
they
put
this
settlement
in
to
show
that
the
two
cases
were
different.
that's
what
they
said.
they
told
the
court,
why
is
it
a
different
case?
that's
the
funniest
plea
of
release
i
ever
heard,
and
there
was
never
any
plea
of
release
and
there
was
never
any
evidence
offered
on
it,
and
no
court
ever
opened
it
up
either
in
the
district
court
or
in
the
court
below
to
permit
such
a
defense
to
be
made.
and,
i
say
the
issue
is
not
before
this
court.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
if
this
court
disagrees
with
me,
well,
i
say
it
had
absolutely
no
bearing
on
the
subject.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
this
is
the
last
resort.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
not
in
this
respect
and
for
a
reason.
i
mean,
you
can't
try
cases
on
offers
of
proof
made
after
the
case
has
been
submitted
and
you're
up
in
the
upper
court
with
no
chance
to
show
what
the
release
was
or
where
it
was
admitted
or
what
the
objections
to
tort
are
and
what
it
included
in
all
the
factual
matters
that
were
involved.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
i
am
saying
that
this
offer
was
made
after
findings
of
fact
had
been
made
and
the
case
have
been
tried.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes,
still
in
the
trial
court,
but
the
release
was
available
at
the
trial
and
not
offered
new
theory.
and
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
no,
the
court
of
appeals
said
nothing
about
the
release.
alright,
so
much
for
the
background
in
this
case,
i
do
want
to
say,
however,
that
there
is
an
anomaly
from
what
i
have
said
already,
in
that,
some
of
the
leading
lawyers
in
this
country:
whitney
norcimo
or
--
who's
later
president
of
the
bar
asso
--
the
american
bar
association
and
john
k.
hill,
leading
lawyer
in
there,
advised
their
clients
to
pay
$10
million
for
damages
suffered
by
zenith
up
until
1957
and
this
lower
court
now
holds,
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
sort
of
a
conspiracy
couldn't
cause
any
damage
whatever.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
no.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
right.
that's
all
the
court
dealt
with
the
parent,
assume
tacitly,
i
believe
it
had
to,
to
reach
this
point.
and,
the
government
has
filed
a
brief
here.
i
mean,
there
really
isn't
any
question
really
about
the
illegality
of
these
pools
under
the
decisions
of
this
court.
alright,
i
first
want
to
address
myself
to
the
canadian
market.
were
we
damaged?
was
there
substantial
evidence
of
damage
in
the
canadian
market?
in
1926,
there
was,
put
together
up
in
canada,
canadian
radios
patent
limited
and
it
was
composed
of
our
competitors,
people
who
sold
radio
and
television
sets
in
competition
with
us
here
and
in
canada,
if
we
ever
got
into
the
market.
i
have
never
seen
a
case,
and
i'm
sure
this
court
hasn't
either,
where
the
evidence
of
the
conspiracy
is
written
down
sponsored
and
put
in
evidence
by
the
respondents.
usually,
the
conspiracy
case
we
have
to
try
is
a
case
where
he
went
for
a
conspiracy
from
a
number
of
different
acts.
and,
this
court
held
in
--
a
long
time
ago
in
the
interstate
circuit
case
that
the
old
days
of
proving
conspiracy
by
having
people
gathered
around
the
table
had
gone
to
a
darker
age.
now,
we
prove
conspiracies,
particularly
business
conspiracies,
by
showing
a
plan
which
it
is
designed
to
destroy
or
interfere
with
competition
and
a
joiner
in
it
would
not
of
its
intent
or
purport.
that's
what
you
have
to
prove,
but
we
have
nothing
in
the
way
of
inference
in
that
sort
of
proof.
but,
to
understand
the
impact
on
the
damage
issue,
this
court
has
to
see
what
this
conspiracy
was
designed
to
do,
namely
to
control
a
complete
market,
pursuant
to
an
overall
conspiracy
to
control
all
the
markets
of
the
world.
plaintiff's
exhibit
50
(a),
which
was
put
into
evidence
by
my
opponents,
i
didn't
put
it
in.
they
put
it.
it
was
a
report
by
the
royal
canadian
commission.
on
a
submission
made
by
canadian
radio
patents
limited
where
somebody
up
their
distributor
had
complained
that
they
were
keeping
him
from
importing
sets
into
canada,
and
they
heard
all
the
evidence
and
they
issued
a
report
and
i
want
to
read
some
of
it,
if
the
court
would
bear
with
me.
this
is
the
whole
conspiracy
so
far
as
canada
is
concerned.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
a
royal
canadian
commission
and
it
was
issued
and
dated
december
31,
1959
within
this
damage
period
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
i
am
reading
from
plaintiff's
exhibit
50
(a)
which
is
found
in
the
record
at
appendix
2811
and
2829-30.
canadian
radio
patents
limited,
hereafter
called
crpl,
was
incorporated
in
1926
for
the
purpose
of
acting
as
a
patent
licensing
agency.
at
the
time
of
the
presentation
of
its
brief
to
this
commission,
it
acted
as
a
central
patent
licensing
agency
in
the
administration
of
patent
rights
in
the
radio,
television,
and
general
electronics
steels
in
respect
to
patents
owned
by
its
then
five
shareholders:
canadian
general
electric
company,
canadian
westinghouse
company,
northern
electric
company.
and,
if
i
may
interpolate
it,
northern
electric
company
is
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
the
american
telephone
and
telegraph
company,
canadian-marked
coating
company
which
is
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
the
english-canadian
mark
--
english-marked
tony
company.
and,
canadian
radio
manufacturing
company,
which
is
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
the
philips
company
of
harland,
enacted
as
licensing
agent
in
canada
for
rca
victor
company
and
hazeltine
electronics
corporation,
the
respondent
in
this
case.
the
portfolio
in
respect
of
which
crpl
had
the
right
to
grant
licenses
consisted
of
5,000
patents
and,
in
the
absence
of
a
license
from
crpl,
it
is
doubtful
if
anyone
could
sell
in
canada
a
radio
or
television
receiver.
crpl
indicated
that
it
does
not
grant
a
license
to
any
importer
of
radio
or
television
receivers
except
in
the
limited
situation
where
the
type
or
kind
of
radio
or
television
receiver
sought
to
be
imported
is
not
manufactured
by
any
radio
or
television
receiver
manufacturer
in
town.
it
is
particularly
in
respect
to
this
policy
of
crpl
in
precluding
importers
from
bringing
into
canada
radio
and
television
receivers
that
the
complaint
was
made
to
this
commission.
it
was
stated
to
be
the
policy
of
crpl
to
enforce
its
patent
right
against
any
person
who
sells
in
canada
an
imported
radio
or
television
receiver
which
infringes
any
one
or
more
of
a
patent
in
its
portfolio.
now,
how
did
they
enforce
it?
and,
the
record
is
clear
on
it.
there
isn't
any
denial.
they
had
patent
agents
and
investigators,
and
they
went
around
and
they're
shock
to
see
if
there
are
any
imported
radio
sets.
if
there
were,
they'd
turn
them
in
to
the
pool
and
the
pool,
then,
started
suits
and
most
of
the
suits,
according
to
the
documentary
evidence
coming
from
the
files
of
the
pool,
ended
in
an
agreement
by
the
distributer,
never
to
handle
a
set
again
that
was
imported
into
canada.
and,
our
res
--
and,
our
distributers
had
to
enter
into
such
agreement,
and
we
have
a
family
name
of
cosby.
documents
are
in
the
case.
he
had
to
agree
that
he
wouldn't
handle
it
unless
it
was
licensed
and
the
only
way
it
could
be
licensed,
and
we
have
our
answers
replete
with
demands
by
zenith
to
get
licenses
and
they
couldn't
get
licenses
and,
while
it's
said
that
we
didn't
formally
asked
for
a
license
after
1953,
we
had
a
lawsuit
that
ran
through
1957
which
was
designed
to
break
up
this
illegal
restriction
on
licensing
and,
and
we
did
get
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
the
pool.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
we
couldn't
ship
any
sets
up
there
that
were
licensed
because
they
said
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes,
because
they
said,
mr.
justice
black,
they
said
"you
cannot
have
a
license
from
these
5,000
patents
in
this
pool
unless
you
build
a
factory
in
canada
and
produce
your
product
there.
you
can't
produce
it
in
chicago
and
ship
it
into
canada
and
sell
it
in
our
market."
how
could
you
stop
commerce
between
countries
any
more
effectively
than
that?
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
no,
it's
not
justified
by
any
law
that
i
know
of.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
we
had
the
issue
made,
mr.
justice
black.
we
had
the
issue
made
in
the
district
court,
that
this
was
authorized
by
canadian
patent
law
and
we
tried
it
out
and
they
lost
that
issue.
and,
the
district
court
made
a
specific
finding
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
canadian
patent
law
which
justified
any
such
cite
of
a
proceeding,
and
even
if
there
has
been
and
they
could
do
it
with
their
individual
patents,
it's
elementary
that
when
they
join
in
a
conspiracy
with
our
competitors
to
use
this
as
to
stop
our
competition,
and
i'm
going
to
get
into
that
in
a
minute
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
in
canada,
yes,
but
it's
the
flow
of
commerce
from
the
united
states
into
canada
that's
being
interfered
with.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
that's
a
government
thing.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
the
government
could
do
anything
they
want,
and
i'm
not
talking
about
the
government.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
no,
this
is
not
a
government
organization.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
no,
absolutely
not.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
this
is
a
private
conspiracy.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
is
it
denied?
there's
no
proof
of
any
sec
--
(voice
overlap)
why,
of
course.
there's
no
proof
of
that.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
no
contention.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
the
view
of
the
other
side
took
wise
that
under
canadian
patent
law,
they
had
to
restrict
licenses
for
import,
otherwise,
they
encourage
different
sanctions
on
their
patent
rights.
that
was
their
contention.
now,
we
tried
it
out
on
expert
testimony
and
we
had
canadian
experts
come
down
here,
and
there
was
not
one
single
thing
to
it.
it
was
a
complete
sham
from
top
to
bottom,
and
the
district
court
so
held.
they
didn't
appeal
it.
it
didn't
have
a
--
there
was
no
issue
on
it
in
the
lower
court
and
the
appellate
court
and
they
abandoned
it
here
in
their
brief.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes.
alright,
as
i
say,
they
sent
out
these
investigators
to
scatter
out
imports
and
then
bring
suits
or
write
letters.
the
record
shows
from
their
records
there
wasn't
any
denial
to
any
of
this.
nobody
from
the
pool
ever
got
on
the
stand
on
any
issue
in
this
case.
worrying
notices
were
widely
published
in
newspapers.
the
pool
boast
newspapers
from
coast
to
coast
carry
the
commandos
total
of
4,343,084
advertising
messages
to
help
put
a
stop
to
importation
of
cheap
substandard
imported
radio
blanketed
at
the
customs.
they
were
our
potential
customers
in
canada.
then,
they
sent
out
a
warning
note
and
they
sent
one
out
just
shortly
before
the
suit
started,
and
this
was
addressed
to
importers,
vendors,
or
users
of
radio
and
television
receivers.
that's
all
people
we
could
possibly
sell
to:
an
importer,
a
vendor,
or
a
user.
that's
our
entire
market.
now,
here's
an
inducement
to
boycott
our
product
in
the
entire
country
of
canada.
we
wish
to
bring
to
your
attention
that
canadian
radio
patents
limited
is
a
central
patent
licensing
agency
administering
various
important
canadian
patents
of
invention
relating
to
radio
and
television
receivers,
and
then
they
listed
their
licensee.
of
course,
we
weren't
licensed.
so,
we
weren't
licensed.
so,
we
weren't
listed.
and
then,
they
say
"the
above
companies
our
working
the
patented
inventions
in
canada
on
a
commercial
scale
and
are
preparing
and
willing
to
meet
the
public
demand
for
the
patented
articles
in
canada
on
agreeable
terms."
now,
here
is
the
threat.
"canadian
radio
patents
desires
to
inform
importers,
vendors,
purchasers,
or
users
of
radio
and
television
receivers
which
infringe
patent
rights
owned
or
administered
by
canadian
radio
patents
limited
and
are
listed
above
that
they
will
be
held
liable
to
canadian
radio
patents
limited
on
account
of
said
infringement."
then,
they
sent
out
notices
"only
canadian
made
canadian
sold
sets
are
licensed
under
the
basic
patents
of
canadian
radio
patents
limited."
my
opponents
in
the
trial
court,
in
attempt
to
sustain
the
issue
that
mr.
justice
black
referred
to,
that
there
was
some
law
up
there
in
canada
which
would
justify
this
sort
of
comeback.
put
a
man
on
a
stand
by
the
name
of
gordon
fripp
henderson
who
was
a
member
of
a
firm
that
had
represented
this
pool
for
years
and
years
and
years.
but
just
a
minute,
before
i
get
into
that,
hazeltine
put
its
patents
in
this
pool
in
1943
without
--
with
extensions
up
until
1963,
past
the
damage
period.
i
don't
know
what's
happened
since
because
we
have
no
proofs.
they
say,
now,
they're
not
in
it
because
they've
been
enjoined.
they
say
they
filed
an
affidavit
where
they've
done
something
about
it,
but
there
is
no
injunction
now,
which
has
never
been
superseded,
to
get
out
of
the
pool.
and,
they're
pleading
here
that
because
they're
now
obeying
a
court
injunction
that
that
in
some
way
absolves
him
from
getting
into
this
pool.
but,
anyway,
they
got
into
the
pool
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
the
injunction
enjoined
them
from
staying
in
these
pools.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
united
states
district
court
in
chicago,
entered
by
judge
austin,
i
--
right
after
he
made
his
little
speech
about
the
patent
law
where
he
finally
weakened
and,
unwindless,
admitted
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
law
that
justified
their
position
and
retracted
his
whole
position.
we
went
into
the
cross-examination
of
this
witness,
who
was
the
attorney
for
the
pool
and
who'd
made
the
submission
by
the
pool
to
the
canadian
--
a
royal
canadian
commission,
thoroughly
familiar
with
all
of
it,
worked
for
him
for
years,
and
years,
and
years.
i
crossed
examined
him
and
i
want
to
read
some
of
his
cross-examination
because
it
shows
the
impact
of
this
conspiracy
and
what
it
was
intended
for,
what
it
was
intended
to
do,
and
what
had
actually
did
do
within
this
damage
period,
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
says,
as
a
matter
of
law,
can't
under
our
antitrust
laws
constituted
damage.
he
said
"my
law
firm
presented
the
submissions
on
behalf
of
canadian
radio
patents
limited
and
it
certainly
sought
to
say
that
canadian
radio
patents
limited
was
not
doing
anything
illegal."
he
said
that
part
was
submitted
on
december
31,
1959,
that's
within
our
damage
period.
question:
"now,
you
told
us
this
morning
that
you
knew
what
the
policy,
the
licensing
policy
of
canadian
radio
patents
limited
was
and
then,
as
i
understand
you
to
state
it,
the
policy
was
not
to
license
import
where
there
was
manufacturing
in
canada."
answer:
"that
is
correct."
question:
"now,
imports
that
came
in
within
the
electronics
field
would
represent
competition
to
the
owners
of
this
pool,
would
it
not?"
answer:
"certainly."
question:
"no
question
about
it
is
there?"
answer:
"i
would've
thought
not."
question:
"the
portfolio
in
respect
to
which
crpl
had
the
right
to
grant
licenses
consisted
of
5,000
patents
and,
in
the
absence
of
a
license
from
crpl,
it
is
doubtful
if
anyone
can
sell
in
canada
a
radio
or
television
receiver.
was
that
considered?"
answer:
"of
course
they
considered
it.
they
wrote
it.
they
considered
that
aspect
of
the
matter
and
they
referred
to
it
in
the
report."
and
i
said,
"well,
do
you
consider
that
a
company
like
zenith
radio
exporting
into
canada
is
competition
for
the
members
of
the
pool?"
"well,
i
didn't
get
any
answer
to
that.
so,
i
asked
him
another
question.
"and
that
would
include
zenith
radio
corporation,
wouldn't
it?"
answer:
"it
would
include
anyone
at
that
time
who
sought
to
sell
in
canada
radio
receiving
sets."
"and,
you
have
told
us
that
if
zenith
is
a
competitor
and
if
it
doesn't
manufacture,
if
there
are
manufacturers
in
canada,
then
this
pool
will
not
license
zenith
to
import
anything
into
canada.
isn't
that
right?"
answer:
"they
will
not
license."
"the
importation
into
canada,
in
respect
of
the
type
and
kind
of
television
set
or
radio
set
that
is
being
made
in
canada,
that
is
correct,
and
this
includes
home
radio
and
television
sets."
question:
"the
report
says
it
was
stated
to
be
the
policy
of
crpl
to
enforce
its
patent
right
against
any
person
who
sells
in
canada
an
imported
radio
or
television
receiver
which
infringes
any
one
or
more
of
the
patents
in
this
portfolio,
except
in
the
limited
area
where
permission
has
been
granted
to
import
the
apparatus
which
crpl
agrees
is
not
of
a
type
or
kind
made
in
this
country.
is
that
what
they
arrived
at?"
answer:
"it
so
states,
the
report
so
states."
"and,
that
was
crpl's
statement,
wasn't
it?"
answer:
"that
is
crpl
that
made
the
submission.
"that
made
the
submission
that
that
is
what
they
were
doing?"
"now,
under
that,
zenith
couldn't
get
a
license
to
import
at
all
unless
they
manufacture
up
there,
could
they?
i
am
talking
about
seeking
to
import
something
that
is
competitive
with
the
members
of
the
pool."
answer:
"and
something
that
is
being
made
in
canada?"
"yes,
by
the
pool."
answer:
"then,
their
stated
policy
is
that
they
would
not
grant
a
license
to
import."
they're
competitors.
they're
joint
shoulder-to-shoulder
with
a
great
mass
of
patents.
whether
they're
valid
or
not,
they
could
keep
the
litigation
forever
and
ever
in
forcing
those
patents.
and,
by
the
way,
the
district
court
found
that
the
instant
suit,
which
was
brought
in
a
hazeltine
patent
which
was
in
the
pool,
was
brought
pursuant
to
the
pool.
hazeltine
came
into
this
pool
in
1943.
the
record
shows
that
they
volunteered
their
patents
to
be
used
in
litigation
against
importers,
documentary
evidence.
the
record
shows
that
they
were
in
these
pools
by
their
own
admission
knowing
that
the
purpose
of
the
pool
was
to
exclude
importation.
no
question
about
it,
admitted
by
their
general
counsel
on
his
cross-examination
and
upon
his
deposition.
and,
they
said
they
were
in
the
pool,
the
canadian
pool,
and
they
intended
--
right
in
the
trial
they
said
they
were
in
the
pool
and
they
intended
to
stay
in
that
pool,
flaunted
their
participation
in
the
pool,
and
they
said
the
reason
for
it
was
to
get
more
bucks
for
hazeltine.
well,
i
suppose
every
illegal
activity
from
the
beginning
of
time
down
to
date
has
had
something
about
getting
more
bucks
or
more
money
out
of
the
illegal
activity,
and
that,
certainly,
is
no
justification
with
all
due
deference.
there
are
some
rather
interesting
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes,
right
in
the
back
of
our
brief
which
we
set
out,
and
i'll
read
it
to
your
honor.
it's
on
page
--
it's
--
this
is
the
record
i'm
reading
from.
let
me
read
it
to
you
from
the
record
which
--
it's
made
an
appendix
to
our
original
brief.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
finding
32.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
original
brief,
not
the
petition
but
the
original
brief
in
this
court.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes,
that's
it.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
the
court
held
the
proofs
established
as
a
fact
that,
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
canadian
patent
act
does
not
require
the
pool
to
refuse
to
license
importation
that's
contended
by
plaintiff,
nor
does
the
act
penalize
in
any
way
a
patentee
who
license
for
importation
whereas,
in
this
case,
there's
been
carried
on
extensive
manufacturing
in
canada
under
its
patents
rules
squarely.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
no,
not
another
thing,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
not
another
thing.
there
was
a
time
--
this
is
digression.
there
was
a
time
when
canada
restricted
imports
under
the
patent
law.
then,
they
had
a
commerce
of
the
different
countries
of
patent
companies,
and
they
all
recognize
that
they
all
had
mutual
interest
in
breaking
down
these
patent
restrictions,
which
is
restrained
trade
between
different
countries.
so,
they
changed
it
and
they
said,
under
the
congress
--
wasn't
it
congress?
congress
at
24?
well,
anyway,
there
was
a
congress
that's
in
the
record
that,
under
that
congress,
no
country
who
wanted
to
stay
at
the
time
could
put
any
restriction
on
patents
or
upon
the
import
of
goods
which
were
patented.
and,
that
was
written
in
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
to
the
canadian
patent
law,
and
the
canadian
patent
law
says
nothing
in
this
act
shall
be
construed
in
con
--
to
controvert
any
trade,
and
this
was
a
trade.
so,
it
was
clear
onto
the
path.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
no,
sir.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
for
a
year-and-a
half.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
right.
and
that
was
excluded
from
the
damages.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
that
was
excluded
from
the
damages,
and
there
are
no
damages
in
this
judgment
which
cover
any
period
where
there
was
a
government
embargo,
but
we're
not
talking
about
a
government
embargo
here,
which
i
think
your
honor
understands.
talking
about
a
private
conspiracy
designed
by
electronic
competitors
all
over
the
world.
alright,
to
go
back
to
my
lawsuit
in
chicago,
we
thought
we'd
settled
the
case
and
that
we
could
now
go
to
work
in
canada
and
develop
our
market.
that's
what
we
thought.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
that's
in
1957.
that
was
settled
in
september
9,
1957.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
of
$10
million
and
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
and
also,
the
licensing
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
by
general
electric
and
by
rca
and
by
westinghouse.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
a
patent
up
to
that
date,
not
including
colored
television.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
up
to
that
date.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
exactly
right.
so,
we
start
to
go
into
canada
and
mr.
wright
testified,
and
no
denial
of
his
testimony,
no
witness
got
up
on
the
witness
stand.
and,
they
say
we
ought
to
brought
some
distributers
in,
but
here's
something
i
want
to
bring
out
before
i
get
into
this.
there
was
a
conspiracy
within
a
conspiracy.
they
had
distributor's
organizations
up
in
canada
which
were
cooperating
hand-in-glove
with
this
pool,
and
they
comprised
the
people
you
have
to
deal
with.
when
you
sell
sets,
you
have
to
go
to
distributors.
and,
the
court
below
criticizes
us
because
we
didn't
bring
in
distributors.
the
distributors
were
all
banning
against
us,
and
the
record
shows,
by
documentary
evidence
of
their
minutes,
where
they're
trying
to
cooperate
with
the
pool
and
say
"tell
us
what
we
can
do.
tell
us
what
we
can
do
to
help
you
and
stop
the
import
of
american
products
into
canada."
they
were
all
in
it.
so,
when
we
go
up
there,
mr.
wright
testified
and
there's
no
denial
of
its
testimony,
and
they
tried
to
impugn
its
testimony
and
i've
seen
some
funny
things
in
lawsuits
but
never
in
my
life
have
i
seen
witnesses
attempted
to
be
impugned
by
documents
which
are
not
in
the
evidence,
which
were
never
even
presented
until
a
year
after
the
case
had
been
tried
where
no
ef
--
no
chance
has
ever
been
made
to
meet
any
of
the
documents
which
they
claim
impeach
mr.
wright's
testimony.
in
other
words,
ordinarily,
cases
are
tried
on
a
record
made
in
the
trial
court
and,
here,
they
come
in
with
pages
of
offers
of
proof
with
new
counsel,
trying
to
get
a
new
grasp
of
the
case
a
year
after
it's
been
tried
and
the
trial
court
said
that
that
--
these
things
all
were
available
at
the
trial.
why
weren't
they
produced?
no
excuse
given.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes,
the
findings
had
all
been
made.
the
case
had
been
put
to
bed
and
a
year
had
gone,
and
they
come
in
with
new
counsel
with
this
new
attempt
to
try
the
case
all
over
again,
and
the
district
court
wouldn't
do
it
and
rightly
sought
the
matter
of
discretion
with
the
district
court
whether
to
reopen
the
case.
and,
the
new
evidence
rule
is
conclusive
on
all
the
sellers,
whatever
it
was,
was
available
at
the
time
of
the
trial
and
never
produced
until
a
year
after
the
trial.
and
then,
it's
largely
counsel's
statements
and
what
they
would
do
and
what
they
wouldn't.
i
mean,
ordinary
cases
are
tried
on
the
records
made
at
the
trial.
this
is
an
exception,
apparently.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes,
i
am.
i
certainly
am,
but
i'm
getting
to
the
question
now
of
the
fact
of
damages.
and,
the
fact
of
damage,
the
way
the
courts
have
been
construing
it,
and
i
say
that
was
always
done,
but
the
fact
of
damage
is
the
foundation
and
you
start
from
there
with
the
proof
of
the
actual
damage.
what
was
the
fact
of
damage?
the
fact
of
damage,
number
one,
we
didn't
have
any
licenses
on
pool
patents.
number
two,
everybody
in
that
trade
for
years,
since
1926
at
least,
had
been
conditioned
to
the
fact
that,
without
a
pool
license,
anybody
who
handle
sets
was
subject
to
suit,
was
subject
to
harassment,
was
subject
to
letters
being
sent
out
to
the
potential
customers,
not
only
of
ours
but
of
the
distributors
themselves,
the
user.
they
were
published
in
the
trade
papers.
they
were
published
in
the
press.
it
was
inducement
to
boycott
an
entire
market.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
against
us.
the
suit
from
chicago
was
filed
pursuant
to
this.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
infringement
suit,
yes,
on
a
patent
in
the
pool.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
no,
it
was
the
court
--
the
trial
court
held
it
was
pursuant
to
this
conspiracy
and
it
was
admitted.
i'm
going
to
get
to
that
after
the
luncheon
break.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
not
now.
we
did.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
years
ago,
in
1949
or
1959.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
we
had
no
tax
from
hazeltine.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
claiming
infringement
on
a
patent
which
was
in
the
canadian
pool.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
in
this
country
only.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
after
the
1957
settlement,
as
i
said
this
morning,
the
zenith
company
undertook
to
go
into
the
canadian
market
with
their
radio
and
television
sets.
now,
here
are
two
contiguous
markets,
canada
and
united
states,
fighting
alongside
each
other
so
far
as
the
boring
areas
are
concerned,
canadian
listeners
can
pick
up
broadcast
from
television
and
radio
along
the
border
of
american
stations.
there's
no
difference
in
the
sets.
they
had
the
same
lines.
they
had
the
same
cycles.
testimony
was
that
the
two
products
--
of
the
two
products,
that
the
american
product
was
far
superior
than
to
the
canadian
product,
that
the
contiguous
markets
had
essentially
the
same
competition,
although
there
was
more
competition
in
the
united
states
market
than
there
was
in
united
states.
mr.
wright
testified
that
he
went
up
there
and
tried
to
establish
distribution
in
that
market.
there
was
a
ready
demand
for
a
product,
survey
had
shown
that,
and
he
couldn't
find
distributors.
distributors,
as
i
pointed
out
this
morning,
were
in
these
associations.
we
have
the
minutes
of
some
of
their
meetings
tied
up
with
the
pool.
he
couldn't
get
distributors
for
the
reason
that
they
had
been
conditioned
like
pablo's
dog
for
years
and
years
to
the
sounding
of
the
gong
of
the
canadian
radio
patents,
the
threat
the
constant
inherent
threat
against
everybody
in
the
trade
with
the
warning
notices,
with
the
investigations,
with
the
lawsuits,
and
that
was
the
market.
and,
the
pool
was
there,
still
in
existence,
run
by
a
general
electric
even
though
the
government
had
started
the
suit
against
them
and
had
gotten
a
consent
decree
whereby
three
of
the
conspiring
companies
had
agreed
to
license
their
sets
without
importation
which,
by
the
way,
negative
any
thought
that
there
was
anything
in
canadian
law
that
would
prevent
them
from
licensing
for
importation,
but
permitted
the
general
electric
company
to
continue
to
run
that
pool
and
general,
i
think,
continued
to
run
the
pool
with
a
permitted
organization,
managers,
investigators,
and
what
have
you.
so,
mr.
wright
testified
that
he
couldn't
get
distribution,
the
kind
of
distribution
to
which
a
product
of
zenith
was
entitled
to
in
a
market.
and,
the
reason
he
couldn't
get
it
was
because
of
the
threats
of
the
pool
against
the
potential
distributors
which
he
tried
to
get.
he
said
he
could
get
some
distribution
in
the
western
provinces
where
there
are
very
sparse
settlements
out
there
and
some
in
the
maritime
province.
but,
along
the
contiguous
territories,
he
couldn't
get
them.
so,
he
had
to
use
the
hearing
aid
distributor.
we
had
a
hearing
aid
distributor.
that's
another
product
of
zenith.
we
had
a
canadian
zenith
which
distributed
hearing
aids
and
he
used
them
to
try
and
build
up
some
distribution.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
we
didn't
have
them,
and
i'm
coming
to
that
in
just
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
right.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
that's
right,
and
i'm
going
to
get
right
to
that.
how
--
i'll
show,
your
honor,
why
and
how
and
the
effect
of
not
having
them
is.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
1959-1963,
may
of
1959
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
so,
he
couldn't
get
distributors
so
he
had
to
use
his
hearing
aid
distributors.
and,
even
under
that
impediment,
he
was
able
to
sell
some
sets
by
5%
of
the
market,
the
proof
show,
as
against
20%
which
zenith
was
selling
in
the
united
states.
where
90
more
had
gotten
on
their
way
up
there
then
a
man
by
the
name
of
bryan
mcconnell,
no
relation
to
mine,
he
ran
the
pool.
he
was
an
employee
of
general
electric.
he
ran
the
pool
and
he
came
to
mr.
kellee
arts,
manager
of
our
hearing
aid
company,
and
he
said
"what
are
you
doing
here?
are
you
going
to
manufacture
in
canada?
you
can't
import
sets
in
here
because
we
know
that
you
got
some
licenses
under
your
settlement
in
1957,
but
we
have
other
patents
which
you're
controlling.
we
have
marconi
patents,
we
have
hazeltine
patents,
we
have
philips
patents,
and
they
can't
be
licensed
for
import.
you
have
to
manufacture
in
canada."
no
dispute
to
that
congress
sanction.
mcconnell
doesn't
deny
it.
nobody
denies
it.
it's
a
merit
on
this
record
that
that's
what
he
told
us
and
that
"we
want
diagrams
of
your
sets
to
examine,"
and
we
gave
them
to
him
and
he
took
them
home
and
then
he
came
back
and
he
said
"you
are
infringing
these
patents,"
and
he
sent
us
a
notice
within
the
damage
period
in
which
he,
with
regular
notice,
threaten
the
suit.
"you
are
infringing
the
patent."
that's
the
way
you
start
an
infringement
suit,
names
the
patents,
and
then
encloses
a
pool
license
which
is
limited
to
manufacture
in
canada.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes,
we
went
in
but
we
only
made
5%,
and
the
court
of
appeals
below
seems
to
think
that
there
must
be
a
total
exclusion
from
a
market.
we're
saying
that
the
impedimenta
of
the
pool
and
the
effect
that's
it
had
to
create
boycotts
of
our
product
during
the
damage
period
was
impedimenta
which
we
were
faced
continuously,
cumulatively,
as
this
court
said
in
the
united
shoe
machinery
case.
and,
true,
we
could've
sued
back
in
1957
as
they
said
--
this
court
said
in
the
shoe
machinery
case
but
we
could
still
sue
in
1959.
if
the
effect
of
this
illegal
conspiracy,
which
haven't
been
terminated,
which
is
still
existing,
which
is
still
continuing,
which
is
still
going
forth,
and
the
threat
inherent
to
the
whole
trade
and
known
to
the
whole
trade,
and
the
type
was
serious.
the
testimony
is
that,
under
canadian
patent
law,
any
distributor
could
have
all
of
the
product
confiscated
by
the
owner
of
the
patents.
he
couldn't
sell
them
because
he
didn't
have
a
license
to
sell
them.
we
took
that
risk
and
we
took
that
risk,
mr.
justice
white,
relying
on
the
enforcement
of
the
antitrust
laws
of
this
federal
government
on
my
advice.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
exactly,
and
we
have
testimony
and
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
right.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
wright's
testimony
wasn't
denied.
kaplan
testified
the
same
way.
it
wasn't
denied.
nobody
from
the
pool
came
in
and
said
we
could
get
distributors,
nobody.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
we
are
a
competitor
beautifully
equipped
to
compete.
that's
the
rule
that's
been
laid
down
in
the
antitrust
cases.
are
we
dealing
with
a
competitor
equipped
to
compete?
and,
we
were.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
no,
we
couldn't
get
the
distribution
system
because
of
an
illegal
conspiracy,
and
that's
what
we're
complaining
about,
one
of
the
things.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
no,
because
we
were
threaten
with
infringement
suits
on
every
single
set
we
sold,
and
we
have
sold
--
i
don't
know
how
many
sets.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes,
but
the
potential
liability
still
exists.
we
could
be
sued
on
--
for
the
profit
on
every
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
exactly,
by
mr.
wright.
he
said
he
didn't
dare
develop
it
to
sense.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
to
some
extent,
yes,
trying
to
preserve
what
market
he
had
and,
by
the
way,
it's
grown
under
the
protection
of
the
corporate
decree
in
the
district
court
to
$14
million
a
year,
corroborating
the
testimony
of
mr.
wright
and
mr.
kaplan.
now,
i
want
to
go
back
for
a
moment.
23
years
ago,
i
appeared
before
this
court
in
the
so-called
bigelow
case.
it
involved
jackson
park
theatre
in
chicago,
and
we
had
a
jury
verdict
and
it
went
up
on
appeal
to
the
same
court
of
appeals
in
the
seventh
circuit.
and,
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
only
method
of
proving
damages
is
to
compare
an
open
market
for
the
close
market
and,
for
a
quarter
of
the
sensory,
the
motion
picture
industry
had
destroyed
an
open
market
in
chicago.
there
was
no
such
comparison.
and
so,
obviously,
nobody
could've
made
that
kind
of
proof.
so,
the
card
held
that
there
was
no
fact
of
damage
and
reversed
the
case
and
came
up
here
by
certiorari.
and
this
court,
in
that
case,
said
that
where
wrongdoers,
violators
of
the
act
have
destroyed
an
open
market
comparison,
estimates
can
be
used.
and,
in
that
case,
the
only
evidence
we
had
was
the
estimate
of
our
theater
manager.
that,
absent
the
restrictions
of
the
conspiracy,
we
could've
done
as
much
business
as
a
competing
theater.
and,
the
court
held
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes,
and
we
have
an
open
market
in
the
united
states
which
is
contiguous
with
the
canadian
market
which
is
comparable
in
all
respects
as
to
competition,
as
to
markets,
as
to
broadcast,
and
all
the
rest,
and
to
compare
one
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
some
of
them
have
gone
in
and
some
of
them
have
failed,
but
the
point
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
white,
is
whether
or
not
we
can
be
compelled
to
exceed
to
stopping
commerce.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
there's
no
such
evidence
in
this
record.
there's
no
such
contention
made
in
this
record.
nobody
got
into
the
witness
stand
and
said
"if
you
build
a
plant
up
there,
you
couldn't
have
gotten
more
than
5%."
no
countervailing
evidence
to
ours.
the
cases
say,
"why,
sure
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
on
the
estimate
that's
made
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
not
in
this
record,
there
isn't.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
well,
the
evidence
that's
available,
and
there
is
some
inferences
on
the
evidence.
there's
the
testimony
of
mr.
kaplan
that
he
made
a
survey
and
found
it
was
absolutely
utterly
uneconomical
to
produce
sets
in
canada
with
canadian
labor
and
all
the
rest
of
it,
and
there
was
other
evidence
that
three
companies
that
went
in
there
and
tried
it
failed.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
i
run
it
for
me
because
why
should
we
be
compelled
to
go
into
canada
in
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws?
we
have
the
protection
of
these
laws,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
well,
may
be
so,
your
honor,
but
the
court
below,
the
district
court,
and
the
courts
of
appeals
have
said
this
time
and
time
again,
and
you
said
it
in
this
court
in
the
bigelow
case,
the
weight
of
the
testimony
of
this
kind
is
for
the
district
court,
not
to
be
weighed
on
some
suppositation
--
supposititious
case
of
--
but,
with
all
due
deference
now,
i'm
not
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
or
that's
a
difference
of
opinion,
too.
well,
i
have
one
further
contention
to
make.
my
time
is
running
out.
we
show
by
the
inference
in
transposing
it,
and
bear
in
mind,
mr.
justice
white,
that
there
was
no
objection
to
the
inference.
the
computations
came
in
without
objection.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
19
million,
trebled.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
treble,
yes.
the
third
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
no,
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
no.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
they
don't
get
to
that
question
because
there
is
no
fact
of
damage,
and
without
a
fact
of
damage
we
don't
get
to
bigelow
or
any
other.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
solely
either
actual
or
threatened.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
right,
no
holding
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
right.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
and
that
is
important.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
no,
it
rests
on
the
testimony
of
mr.
wright
--
joseph
wright
who
was
the
partner
of
mr.
sam
kaplan
who,
at
that
time,
was
training.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes,
knowing
all
the
factors,
there's
what
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
the
basis
of
their
testimony
was
that
the
markets
were
contiguous,
that
the
markets
were
essentially
their
claim,
that
the
advertising
in
the
united
states
overlapped
into
canada,
created
a
market
for
our
product,
that
the
competition
was
comparable,
that
our
sets
were
better,
that
the
shipping
problems
and
terriers
were
not
involved.
they
took
them
all
into
consideration
and,
on
the
basis
of
that
and
with
--
kaplan
with
40
years
in
the
business
and
wright,
too,
with
20-something,
testified
from
their
knowledge
that
they
could've
have
done
it
and
could've
gotten
the
same
share
and
there
was
no
cross-examination
and
there
was
no
other
witness
who
testified
any
different.
and,
the
testimony
stands
uncontradicted
on
the
record
and
the
trial
court
adopted
it.
let
me
turn
to
9
--
finding
number
36,
which
is
found
on
the
back
of
the
brief.
the
foreign
commerce
of
finding
--
the
foreign
commerce
of
zenith
in
--
has
been
drastically
curtailed
by
the
patent
pools
in
england,
canada,
and
australia.
the
damages
zenith
has
sustained
were
estimated
by
experienced
officials
of
zenith,
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
business
problems
and
sales
potentials
in
the
markets
involved.
they
determine
the
approximate
damages
sustained
by
a
thorough
of
each
of
the
markets
involved
and
all
relevant
factors
including
terrier,
shipping
costs,
manufacturing
problems.
zenith's
foreign
commerce
has
been
damaged
by
the
pools
in
the
following
amounts
during
the
four-year
statutory
damage
period.
now,
that
was
based
upon
the
same
kind
of
testimony
that
this
court
unequivocally
said
was
proper
in
the
bigelow
case
and
other
cases
since
have
said
whatever
its
weight
may
be,
it's
competent.
and,
it
came
in
without
any
objection.
nobody
objected.
nobody
objected
to
the
computations.
nobody
put
on
any
countervailing
evidence.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
well,
i
can't
answer
your
honor's
question
because
i
have
no
comprehension
of
how
the
court
could
vote
on
this
record
that
there
was
no
fact
of
damage,
or
not
even
a
threat
of
damage.
i
just
don't
understand
it,
to
be
perfectly
candid
and
frank
with
the
court.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
in
part.
it
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
but,
on
the
pools,
it
completely
reversed
it.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes,
gave
us
no
protection
at
all.
now,
here
we
fill
up,
under
the
protection
of
this
injunction,
a
business
of
$14
million,
which
approximates
what
--
and
corroborates
what
the
estimates
were
that
were
made
by
our
officials.
the
consequence,
and
i
can't
understate
this,
the
consequence
of
sustaining
of
taking
away
our
protection
from
this
injunction
is
that
we
can
be
sued
on
every
single
set
we've
ever
sold
under
the
pool
patent
and
we
are
subject
to
a
potential
liability
of
any
profit
that
we
made
on
those
sets
and
we
can
be
forever
barred
from
that
market,
and
here
are
set
three
companies.
we,
to
see
what
this
court
--
we've
taken
$10
million
from
the
bank
in
1957
and
they
wait
to
see
who
is
going
to
get
the
business
that
zenith
has
developed
in
canada.
and
if
that
isn't
a
threat,
i
mean,
i
should
never
have
started
to
practice
law
if
i
gave
it
up
at
the
beginning.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes,
it's
in
the
record
because
we
attached
it
to
our
brief
as
public
record
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
which
this
court
takes
judicial
notice
of.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
they're
a
part
of
it,
yes.
the
colored
television
market,
they
said,
and
i'm
not
an
expert
on
the
patents,
but
they
said
they
have
nine
colored
television
patents
which
control
the
markets
of
the
free
world
and
they're
all
in
the
pool.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
you
could
take
judicial
notice,
but
you
might
also,
with
all
due
deference,
take
judicial
notice
of
a
statement
in
those
reports
that
they
have
been
--
zenith
has
been
restricted
in
these
markets
by
restrictions
of
these
pools
and
that
they
are
trying
their
best
to
fight
out
from
under
them
but,
so
far,
they
haven't
been
able
to
do
it.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
well,
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
the
reason
that
i
have
to
take
the
position
that
i
took
with
justice
fortas
is
this
record
is
closed.
there's
no
other
way
to
show
what
happens
there,
no
other
way.
this
situation
your
honor
is
talking
about,
they
came
in
a
year
after
the
case
is
tried
with
these
reports.
we
are
to
have
no
chance
to
answer
the
reports
or
to
explain
who
wrote
them
or
anything
else
about
it.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
what?
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
i
mean,
they
were
--
they're
not
conclusive
on
anything.
they're
one
out
of
the
evidence
which
never
got
into
the
record.
i
have
a
little
time
left
which
i'm
going
to
reserve
if
i
may.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
pardon
me.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
members
of
the
court.
i
represent
the
zenith
radio
corporation
which
is
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
respondents
are
the
hazeltine
research,
inc.,
a
corporation
which
is
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
the
hazeltine
corporation.
and,
it
was
stipulated
by
the
parties
in
this
case
in
a
pretrial
stipulation
that,
for
all
purposes
in
this
lawsuit
and
all
purposes
in
the
instant
case,
that
the
two
corporations
should
be
considered
one
and
the
same.
the
instant
suit
was
brought
for
the
alleged
infringement
of
a
patent,
a
monochrome
patent
alleged
to
have
been
infringed
by
the
zenith
corporation.
and,
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
below,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
that
patent
was
invalid
and
not
infringed.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
i'm
going
to
reach
that
in
the
course
of
my
argument.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
there
is
that
issue,
your
honor.
i
simply
made
a
statement
because
--
as
part
of
the
facts
in
the
case
that
there
was
that
pretrial
stipulation
and
i'm
treating,
for
this
portion
of
the
argument,
the
two
corporations
as
the
same.
in
that
suit,
zenith
answered
by
setting
up
the
patent
and
other
patents
of
hazeltine
have
been
misused
by
putting
them
into
foreign
patent
pools,
which
foreign
patent
pools
had
refused
to
license
imports
and
had
restricted
commerce
between
united
states
and
foreign
countries,
namely
canada,
england,
and
australia,
contrary
to
the
provisions
of
the
antitrust
law,
the
federal
antitrust
law
that
any
restriction
or
any
combination,
conspiracy,
or
arrangement
between
competitors
which
restrain
commerce
not
only
between
the
states
of
the
united
states
but
between
the
comp
--
the
country
of
the
united
states
and
foreign
countries,
violated
section
4
of
the
clayton
act,
sections
1
and
2
of
the
sherman
act.
and,
under
those
two
sections,
also
section
16
of
the
clayton
act,
alleging
the
same
facts
as
we'd
set
up
in
the
mis
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
i
was
taking
the
task
by
mr.
chadwell
for
not
mentioning
england,
but
i
ran
out
of
time.
i
mean,
i
had
to
choose
something
to
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
i
will,
your
honor.
after
this
case
had
been
submitted,
and
we've
heard
about
the
findings
being
entered,
hazeltine
entered
the
findings.
they
presented
complete
findings
of
every
aspect
in
this
case.
and,
in
those
findings,
time
after
time
after
time,
they
asked
the
trial
court
to
approve
hazeltine
corporation's
entry
into
the
pools,
the
use
of
their
patents
in
the
pools,
that
there
was
no
illegal
use
of
hazeltine
corporation's
patents,
foreign
patents,
and
hazeltine
research,
inc.
had
no
foreign
patents.
they
were
the
patents
of
hazeltine
corporation.
if
they
had
entered
those
findings,
i
couldn't
have
said
one
single
word
about
their
not
being
res
judicata.
i
was
there.
they
presented
them.
we'd
stipulated
that
the
companies
were
the
same
and
they
were
there
asking
for
relief
from
that
court,
and
it
was
owned.
you
talk
about
the
findings
being
written,
but
they
wrote
findings.
the
court
asked
both
sides
to
present
findings.
they
wrote
them.
we
wrote
them.
and,
the
court
entered
our
findings
and
it's
done
and
approved
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
seventh
circuit.
further
than
that,
all
of
their
officials
were
there
during
the
whole
course
of
