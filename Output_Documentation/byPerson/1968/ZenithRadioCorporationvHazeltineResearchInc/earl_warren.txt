chief
justice
earl
warren
from
what
are
you
reading,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask,
where
we'll
find
the
finding
of
the
district
court
with
relation
to
this
in
its
applicability
to
canadian
patent
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
--
it
is
your
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
finding
32,
in
which
one
of
your
briefs
says
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
findings
had
been
made
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
mcconnell.
mr.
mcconnell,
you
may
continue
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
mr.
chadwell.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
there
any
other
testimony?
did
you
offer
any
countervailing
testimony
on
this
subject?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
the
first
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
the
only
reason
that
there
wasn't
any
countervailing
testimony
in
the
first
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
you
took
the
position
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
just
wondering
about
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
it
was
so
wrong
what
they
said,
why
wasn't
that
contraverted
at
the
first
trial?
why
was
it
that
you
would
sit
by
and
let
that
stand
without
saying
anything
against
it
and
lead
the
court
to
a
wrong
finding?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
the
real
purpose
of
your
argument
on
the
embargo
in
light
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
court
say
so?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
chadwell,
as
a
result
of
your
argument
on
the
embargo
in
england,
do
you
want
us
to
hold
that
they're
entitled
to
no
damages
or
do
you
want
us
to
hold
that
the
damages
should
be
diminished
by
raise
of
the
fact
that
they
have
not
tried
to
build
up
any
business
while
the
embargo
was
in
effect?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
agreeable
to
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
chadwell,
is
that
concluded
and
based
on
the
fact
that
we
ought
to
wipeout
of
our
consideration
the
testimony
of
these
two
men?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
there
was
no
embargo
during
the
statutory
period.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
now,
they
do
contend,
do
they
not,
that
the
pool
prevented
them
from
doing
business
in
england
during
the
statutory
period.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well
now,
why
should
we
wipeout
that
testimony
so
far
as
that
is
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
when
did
those
contemporaneous
documents
come
in?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
when
did
it
come
into
this
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
they
admitted
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
kayser.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
you
argue
before
the
court
of
appeals
on
that
subject?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
we
take
your
briefs
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
question
of
legality
as
the
total
of
your
argument
here
if
we
come
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
would've
thought
in
the
court
of
appeals
you
would
have
to
reach
it
exhaustively
because
you
had
the
findings
against
you.
and,
i
would
think
that
you'd
want
to
prove
to
the
best
of
your
ability
that
these
were
legal,
if
they
were
legal.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
were
they
not
pleaded
in
the
first
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
finding
on
that
testimony
in
the
trial
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
get
that
last.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
either
the
court's
find
on
that
question
was
whether
that
testimony
was
true?
