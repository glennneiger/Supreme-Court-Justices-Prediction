justice
abe
fortas
mr.
mcconnell,
i'm
sorry
but
you
--
there
is
an
issue
that's
submitted
to
us,
isn't
there,
as
to
whether
both
hazeltine
corporations
are
bound
here
or
whether
it's
just
a
subsidiary
and
not
the
parent?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
a
difference
on
that?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
why
i
didn't
really
understand
why
you
made
your
opening
statement
because
there
is
that
issue.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
there
any
issue
as
to
the
effect
of
the
release
that
zenith
executed
in
this
litigation
that
was
settled
that
has
a
bearing
on
the
present
problem
or
are
you
agreeing
that
what
the
release
operated
to
benefit
hazeltine?
let
me
put
to
you
this
way.
hazeltine
was
not
a
party
to
the
litigation
that
you've
just
described
which
was
settled,
was
it?
justice
abe
fortas
but,
various
companies
who
were
members
of
the
canadian
radio
patent
pool
were
parties.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
well
--
but,
however
it
may
be,
as
part
of
the
settlement
of
that
litigation,
as
i
understand
the
papers
before
us,
zenith
executed
a
release
and
that
release,
in
substance,
exonerated
or
relieved
of
the
defendants,
with
whom
zenith
settled,
of
liability
for
any
past
acts
--
of
any
further
liability
to
zenith
for
any
past
acts.
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
--
one
important
issue
here
or
if
it
is
an
issue
is
whether
you
do
or
do
not,
whether
there
is
or
is
not
agreement
that
that
settlement
operated
to
benefit
hazeltine
as
a
--
as
a
joint
tort
visa
or
whether
it
did
not,
are
you
agreeing
on
that
or
is
that
an
issue
in
dispute
before
this
court?
that's
my
question.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
mcconnell,
you've
got
a
very
elaborate
job
and
i
--
here,
and
i
don't
want
to
interfere
with
you
in
this
elaborate
case,
but
i
--
all
i
want
to
know
is
whether
we
do
or
do
not
have
to
worry
about
the
effect
of
the
release.
and,
from
what
you
tell
me,
i
gather
that
we
do.
justice
abe
fortas
your
adversary
says
that
that
release
does
release
hazeltine
and
you
say
that
it
does
not.
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
it's
at
page
a-17
of
your
brief.
justice
abe
fortas
a-17.
justice
abe
fortas
why
is
that
statement
finding
restricted
to
the
canadian
patent
act?
is
it
there
--
is
there
a
contention
relating
to
any
other
provision
of
canadian
law?
justice
abe
fortas
just
the
canadian
patent
act?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
want
to
in
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
hesitate
to
anticipate
your
argument,
but
the
situation
is
different
during
the
damage
period
in
australia,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
isn't
it
contended
that
australia
had,
during
the
damage
period,
had
some
sort
of
a
governmental
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
import
provisions?
justice
abe
fortas
that
extra
--
that
by
governmental
measure,
precluded
importation.
justice
abe
fortas
and,
that
was
excluded
from
the
damages?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
mcconnell,
after
the
luncheon
recess
you're
going
to
tell
us
about
damages,
aren't
you,
specifically?
justice
abe
fortas
was
it
--
that
was
in
connection
with
your
united
states
business
though,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that,
but
i
mean
to
say
that
this
--
you
have
some
patents
from
hazeltine,
don't
you?
and,
zenith
haven't
used
patents
from
zenith
--
from
hazeltine?
justice
abe
fortas
you
did?
justice
abe
fortas
as
of
the
time
that
this
litigation
was
started
by
hazeltine?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see,
and
so
--
and
this
action
wasn't
cheated
by
hazeltine
and
it
was
instituted
claiming
infringements
here
and
elsewhere
--
in
this
country
and
elsewhere?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that,
but
did
they
claim
that
you
were
infringing
it
by
the
distribution
and
sale
of
sets
in
this
country
only
or
also
in
canada?
justice
abe
fortas
in
this
country
only.
that
was
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
in
that
period
of
time,
mr.
mcconnell,
were
you
handicapped
by
the
lack
of
licenses
under
any
patents
for
importation
into
canada
--
justice
abe
fortas
or
did
you
have
them
by
reason
of
your
settlement?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
you're
talking
--
we're
talking
about,
now,
we're
in
the
period
57
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
subsequent
years,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
mcconnell,
the
position,
i
take
it,
is
this,
and
i'd
like
to
see
whether
you
agree.
let
us
assume
that
the
pool
is
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
let
us
assume
that
hazeltine's
participation
in
it
is
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
let
us
assume
that
you
have
established
the
faint
of
damage
to
zenith.
the
remaining
problem
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
finding
of
the
district
court
as
to
amount
of
damage
was
clearly
erroneous
in
the
case
of
the
canadian
pool.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
no?
justice
abe
fortas
they
held
that
there
was
no
fact
of
damage
as
distinguished
from
--
justice
abe
fortas
as
distinguished
from
no
proof
of
the
amount
of
damage.
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
in
any
event,
we
--
if
we
get
past
that,
let
us
assume,
just
for
purposes
of
this
inquiry,
that
we
believe
that
you
have
established
the
fact
of
damage.
then,
on
the
question
of
the
amount
of
damage
in
whether
there
is
--
whether
the
finding
of
the
district
court
on
that
was
clearly
erroneous
or
not,
what
you
have
submitted
to
us
is
that
you
were
totally
excluded
from
the
market
and
that
the
proper
measure
of
damages
in
those
circumstances
is
the
percentage
of
the
market
that
you
have
in
the
united
states.
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
and
there
--
justice
abe
fortas
are
there,
in
this
record,
any
facts
that
tend
to
show
that
if
you
were
allowed
to
compete
in
canada,
you
would've
--
might
be
able
to
achieve
the
same
percentage
of
market
that
you
achieved
in
the
united
states
or
is
that
--
does
that
rest
totally
on
hypothesis?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
did
they
--
they
testified
that
if
they
could
compete
in
canada
they
would
achieve
the
same
percentage
of
market.
justice
abe
fortas
what
i've
been
trying
to
get
--
suggest
that
you
get
to
is
to
tell
us
briefly,
if
you
will,
what
their
testimony
says,
if
anything,
with
respect
to
the
basis
for
that
conclusory
judgment
of
theirs.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
if
you
don't
mind,
could
you
tell
us
briefly
at
this
point
on
the
basis
stated
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
its
conclusion
that
the
district
court
was
clearly
erroneous
in
finding
the
fact
of
damage?
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
you
had
not
applied
adequately
for
licenses
that
you
--
that
there
was
no
showing
that
you
were
excluded
in
fact,
or
what
was
it?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
$14
million
figure
in
this
record,
mr.
mcconnell?
justice
abe
fortas
now
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
passing
at
for
the
moment,
does
--
is
that
$14
million
a
figure
that
is
attributable
to
products
that
are
covered
by
the
patents
in
the
patent
pool?
justice
abe
fortas
are
they
products
that
would
be
affected
by
the
hazeltine
patents?
justice
abe
fortas
did
the
court
of
appeals
say
anything
about
their
credibility?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
chadwell
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
chadwell,
what
are
the
facts?
now,
you've
been
attacking
the
credibility
of
these
men
and
their
counsel.
justice
abe
fortas
but,
i'm
not
clear
about
what
the
facts
are.
mr.
mcconnell
said
in
his
argument
just
a
little
while
ago
that,
as
i
understand
it,
that
there
was
some
sort
of
an
embargo
in
australia
for
a
year-and-a
half
of
the
damage
period.
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
tell
me
what
the
facts
are,
first,
about
australia.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
right
or
wrong?
justice
abe
fortas
well
--
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
your
damage
period
begins
in
may
1959.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that,
there
was
an
embargo
in
australia
for
that
portion
of
the
damage
period?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
turn
to
england.
justice
abe
fortas
was
there
or
was
there
not
an
embargo
in
england
during
the
damage
period,
namely
may
1959
to
may
1963?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
that's
the
end
of
my
question.
you've
been
talking
about
embargo
here
in
this
and
i
want
to
know
precisely
what
the
facts
are,
as
this
record
shows.
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
but
--
so
that,
when
these
men
were
testifying
that
there
was
no
embargo,
i
don't
know
what
the
context
of
that
testimony
is.
i'm
interested
in
the
facts,
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
attacked
that
testimony.
justice
abe
fortas
you
do
not
want
us
to
get
the
impression
that
they
falsely
testified
that
there
was
no
embargo
in
england
during
the
damage
period.
you
don't
want
to
convey
that.
justice
abe
fortas
i
am
familiar
with
that
point
and
i
understand
that
point.
i
just
did
not
understand
your
previous
argument.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
chadwell,
i
--
based
on
some
experience,
may
i
ask
you
really,
in
the
subs
--
these
people
were
not
cross-examined
in
the
first
trial.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
on
the
second
--
what
you
call
the
second
trial,
which
is
the
production
of
evidence
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
after
the
findings
were
made,
pursuant
to
permission
of
the
court
and,
i
take
it,
your
point
must
be
that,
on
cross-examination
which
is
really
what
it
was,
wasn't
it,
there
was
no
cross-examination
in
the
first
trial
was
this
man?
and
then,
substantially,
on
cross-examination,
these
men
testified,
as
you
have
now
here
narrated
and
perhaps,
in
most,
what
you're
trying
to
say
to
us
is
that
the
things
that
were
brought
out
on
cross-examination
where
more
deviational,
more
deviant
from
what
they
said
on
direct
testimony
than
as
a
common
ordinary
experience
of
lawyers
and
witnesses
in
the
trial
of
cases.
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
because,
every
time
you
examine
a
witness
particularly
on
an
expert
subject
of
this
sort,
you
bring
out
lots
of
facts
that
they
don't
had
duce
on
their
direct
examination.
justice
abe
fortas
before
you
get
to
that,
mr.
kayser
--
before
you
get
to
that,
if
i
may
interrupt
you.
i
take
it
that
what
you're
really
saying
is
that,
with
respect
to
england
on
your
point
two,
as
you've
just
stated
it,
it
says
if
zenith
were
a
stranger
that
this
is
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
that
goes
to
their
desire
to
do
business
in
england,
their
readiness
and
the
ability
to
do
business
in
england
absent
the
alleged
retraints.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
this
evidence,
with
respect
to
the
set
conversion
--
convertibility
of
the
sets,
being
refuted,
there's
no
evidence
in
that
so
--
justice
abe
fortas
so,
it
goes
to
the
question
of
the
fa
--
what
has
been
called
the
fact
of
damages.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
suppose
if
we
should
disagree
with
you
on
that
without
getting
into
the
subtleties
of
that
statement,
if
we
should
disagree
with
you
on
that,
i
take
it
that
neither
you
nor
mr.
chadwell
is
submitting
to
us
that
the
patent
pool
--
you're
not
trying
to
defend
the
legality
under
the
antitrust
laws
of
the
patent
pool
and
of
hazeltine's
participation
in
it.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
you've
made
that
clear.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
i
want
to
be
very
clear
on
one
thing.
are
you
or
are
you
not
arguing
that
the
english
pool,
let's
take
that,
a
and
b,
the
canadian
pool
are
lawful
or
not
unlawful
with
respect
to
the
participation
of
hazeltine
therein?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
adequate.
i
understand
your
language.
i'm
not
asking
you
to
concede
the
illegality
for
it.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
doesn't
matter
one
way
or
the
other,
does
it?
does
it
matter
one
way
or
the
other
with
respect
to
the
outcome
of
this
suit?
justice
abe
fortas
whether
this
suit
grew
out
of
a
domestic
controversy
or
a
controversy
that
enter
its
origins
related
to
the
foreign
countries?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
kayser,
may
i
ask
you
this?
one
of
the
questions
before
us
on
this
branch
of
the
case
could
be
phrased
this
way.
was
there
a
basis
for
the
trial
court
concluding
that,
on
account
of
threats
by
the
pool
to
prevent
the
importation
into
canada
of
products,
zenith
products
manufactured
in
the
united
states,
zenith
was
unable
--
zenith
was
deterred,
prohibited,
prevented,
or
--
from
shipping
its
products
into
canada
and
selling
those
products
there,
number
one.
number
two,
because
of
the
activities
of
the
pool
in
canada,
the
distributor
that
zenith
was
unable
to
obtain
a
full-fledge
distribution
system,
as
you
have
put
it,
and
that
zenith
--
and,
third,
that
was
an
adequate
basis
for
a
district
court
conclusion
that
zenith
wanted
to
and,
but
four
of
the
activities
of
the
pool
either
with
respect
to
prohibiting
forbidding
importation
or
with
respect
to
threats
against
distributors,
zenith
would
have
distributed
and
sold
its
product
in
canada.
should
not
about
what
it
comes
down
to
in
this
branch
of
the
case?
you've
got
two
points.
one,
the
pool
or
the
finding
29
with
respect
to
the
pool
activities
in
prohibiting
importation
of
product
made
in
the
united
states
and,
two,
the
distribution
system.
and,
either
of
those
at
this
remote
distance,
i
suggest
to
you,
arguably
might
support
a
finding
that
the
pool
has
damaged
zenith
in
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
and
then,
the
question
is,
has
it
demonstrated
the
--
what
the
model
damage
is
and,
if
so,
what
is
that?
justice
abe
fortas
but,
as
i
think
my
brother
here
--
was
developed
in
the
colloquy
with
my
brother
white,
the
pool
nevertheless
took
the
position
that
it
would
not
permit
the
importation
of
zenith
products
into
canada.
zenith
could
go
up
there
and
start
a
factory.
but,
however
it
may
be,
i'm
not
asking
you
to
agree
to
the
conclusions
right
now,
mr.
kayser,
but
is
this
the
correct
analysis
of
the
issues
before
us,
that
is
to
say
that
whether
there
is
an
adequate
basis
for
the
district
court's
findings
on
pool
prohibition
of
importation,
whether
there
is
an
adequate
basis
for
what
seem
--
what
is
arguably
implicit
in
the
district
court's
findings,
namely
that
the
pool
threatened
distributors
and,
third,
whether
there's
an
adequate
basis
for
the
finding
that,
but
four
of
these
restraints,
zenith
would
have
sold
its
product
in
canada.
justice
abe
fortas
are
those
the
issues
before
us?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
mcconnell,
i'm
sorry
but
you
--
there
is
an
issue
that's
submitted
to
us,
isn't
there,
as
to
whether
both
hazeltine
corporations
are
bound
here
or
whether
it's
just
a
subsidiary
and
not
the
parent?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
a
difference
on
that?
justice
abe
fortas
i
didn't
really
understand
why
you
made
your
opening
statement
because
there
is
that
issue.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
mcconnell
referred
to
an
annual
report
showing
$14
million
annual
business,
i
gather.
is
that
in
the
same
status
as
the
reports
to
which
you're
referring?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see,
and
you
--
do
you
think
we
can
or
cannot
properly
take
judicial
notice
of
the
report
to
which
he
refers?
justice
abe
fortas
i
said
properly.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
mcconnell,
i'm
sorry
but
you
--
there
is
an
issue
that's
submitted
to
us,
isn't
there,
as
to
whether
both
hazeltine
corporations
are
bound
here
or
whether
it's
just
a
subsidiary
and
not
the
parent?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
a
difference
on
that?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
why
i
didn't
really
understand
why
you
made
your
opening
statement
because
there
is
that
issue.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
there
any
issue
as
to
the
effect
of
the
release
that
zenith
executed
in
this
litigation
that
was
settled
that
has
a
bearing
on
the
present
problem
or
are
you
agreeing
that
what
the
release
operated
to
benefit
hazeltine?
let
me
put
to
you
this
way.
hazeltine
was
not
a
party
to
the
litigation
that
you've
just
described
which
was
settled,
was
it?
justice
abe
fortas
but,
various
companies
who
were
members
of
the
canadian
radio
patent
pool
were
parties.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
well
--
but,
however
it
may
be,
as
part
of
the
settlement
of
that
litigation,
as
i
understand
the
papers
before
us,
zenith
executed
a
release
and
that
release,
in
substance,
exonerated
or
relieved
of
the
defendants,
with
whom
zenith
settled,
of
liability
for
any
past
acts
--
of
any
further
liability
to
zenith
for
any
past
acts.
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
--
one
important
issue
here
or
if
it
is
an
issue
is
whether
you
do
or
do
not,
whether
there
is
or
is
not
agreement
that
that
settlement
operated
to
benefit
hazeltine
as
a
--
as
a
joint
tort
visa
or
whether
it
did
not,
are
you
agreeing
on
that
or
is
that
an
issue
in
dispute
before
this
court?
that's
my
question.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
mcconnell,
you've
got
a
very
elaborate
job
and
i
--
here,
and
i
don't
want
to
interfere
with
you
in
this
elaborate
case,
but
i
--
all
i
want
to
know
is
whether
we
do
or
do
not
have
to
worry
about
the
effect
of
the
release.
and,
from
what
you
tell
me,
i
gather
that
we
do.
justice
abe
fortas
your
adversary
says
that
that
release
does
release
hazeltine
and
you
say
that
it
does
not.
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
it's
at
page
a-17
of
your
brief.
justice
abe
fortas
a-17.
justice
abe
fortas
why
is
that
statement
finding
restricted
to
the
canadian
patent
act?
is
it
there
--
is
there
a
contention
relating
to
any
other
provision
of
canadian
law?
justice
abe
fortas
just
the
canadian
patent
act?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
want
to
in
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
hesitate
to
anticipate
your
argument,
but
the
situation
is
different
during
the
damage
period
in
australia,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
isn't
it
contended
that
australia
had,
during
the
damage
period,
had
some
sort
of
a
governmental
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
import
provisions?
justice
abe
fortas
that
extra
--
that
by
governmental
measure,
precluded
importation.
justice
abe
fortas
and,
that
was
excluded
from
the
damages?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
mcconnell,
after
the
luncheon
recess
you're
going
to
tell
us
about
damages,
aren't
you,
specifically?
justice
abe
fortas
was
it
--
that
was
in
connection
with
your
united
states
business
though,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that,
but
i
mean
to
say
that
this
--
you
have
some
patents
from
hazeltine,
don't
you?
and,
zenith
haven't
used
patents
from
zenith
--
from
hazeltine?
justice
abe
fortas
you
did?
justice
abe
fortas
as
of
the
time
that
this
litigation
was
started
by
hazeltine?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see,
and
so
--
and
this
action
wasn't
cheated
by
hazeltine
and
it
was
instituted
claiming
infringements
here
and
elsewhere
--
in
this
country
and
elsewhere?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that,
but
did
they
claim
that
you
were
infringing
it
by
the
distribution
and
sale
of
sets
in
this
country
only
or
also
in
canada?
justice
abe
fortas
in
this
country
only.
that
was
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
in
that
period
of
time,
mr.
mcconnell,
were
you
handicapped
by
the
lack
of
licenses
under
any
patents
for
importation
into
canada
--
justice
abe
fortas
or
did
you
have
them
by
reason
of
your
settlement?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
you're
talking
--
we're
talking
about,
now,
we're
in
the
period
57
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
subsequent
years,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
mcconnell,
the
position,
i
take
it,
is
this,
and
i'd
like
to
see
whether
you
agree.
let
us
assume
that
the
pool
is
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
let
us
assume
that
hazeltine's
participation
in
it
is
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
let
us
assume
that
you
have
established
the
faint
of
damage
to
zenith.
the
remaining
problem
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
finding
of
the
district
court
as
to
amount
of
damage
was
clearly
erroneous
in
the
case
of
the
canadian
pool.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
no?
justice
abe
fortas
they
held
that
there
was
no
fact
of
damage
as
distinguished
from
--
justice
abe
fortas
as
distinguished
from
no
proof
of
the
amount
of
damage.
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
in
any
event,
we
--
if
we
get
past
that,
let
us
assume,
just
for
purposes
of
this
inquiry,
that
we
believe
that
you
have
established
the
fact
of
damage.
then,
on
the
question
of
the
amount
of
damage
in
whether
there
is
--
whether
the
finding
of
the
district
court
on
that
was
clearly
erroneous
or
not,
what
you
have
submitted
to
us
is
that
you
were
totally
excluded
from
the
market
and
that
the
proper
measure
of
damages
in
those
circumstances
is
the
percentage
of
the
market
that
you
have
in
the
united
states.
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
and
there
--
justice
abe
fortas
are
there,
in
this
record,
any
facts
that
tend
to
show
that
if
you
were
allowed
to
compete
in
canada,
you
would've
--
might
be
able
to
achieve
the
same
percentage
of
market
that
you
achieved
in
the
united
states
or
is
that
--
does
that
rest
totally
on
hypothesis?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
did
they
--
they
testified
that
if
they
could
compete
in
canada
they
would
achieve
the
same
percentage
of
market.
justice
abe
fortas
what
i've
been
trying
to
get
--
suggest
that
you
get
to
is
to
tell
us
briefly,
if
you
will,
what
their
testimony
says,
if
anything,
with
respect
to
the
basis
for
that
conclusory
judgment
of
theirs.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
if
you
don't
mind,
could
you
tell
us
briefly
at
this
point
on
the
basis
stated
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
its
conclusion
that
the
district
court
was
clearly
erroneous
in
finding
the
fact
of
damage?
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
you
had
not
applied
adequately
for
licenses
that
you
--
that
there
was
no
showing
that
you
were
excluded
in
fact,
or
what
was
it?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
$14
million
figure
in
this
record,
mr.
mcconnell?
justice
abe
fortas
now
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
passing
at
for
the
moment,
does
--
is
that
$14
million
a
figure
that
is
attributable
to
products
that
are
covered
by
the
patents
in
the
patent
pool?
justice
abe
fortas
are
they
products
that
would
be
affected
by
the
hazeltine
patents?
justice
abe
fortas
did
the
court
of
appeals
say
anything
about
their
credibility?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
chadwell
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
chadwell,
what
are
the
facts?
now,
you've
been
attacking
the
credibility
of
these
men
and
their
counsel.
justice
abe
fortas
but,
i'm
not
clear
about
what
the
facts
are.
mr.
mcconnell
said
in
his
argument
just
a
little
while
ago
that,
as
i
understand
it,
that
there
was
some
sort
of
an
embargo
in
australia
for
a
year-and-a
half
of
the
damage
period.
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
tell
me
what
the
facts
are,
first,
about
australia.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
right
or
wrong?
justice
abe
fortas
well
--
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
your
damage
period
begins
in
may
1959.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that,
there
was
an
embargo
in
australia
for
that
portion
of
the
damage
period?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
turn
to
england.
justice
abe
fortas
was
there
or
was
there
not
an
embargo
in
england
during
the
damage
period,
namely
may
1959
to
may
1963?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
that's
the
end
of
my
question.
you've
been
talking
about
embargo
here
in
this
and
i
want
to
know
precisely
what
the
facts
are,
as
this
record
shows.
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
but
--
so
that,
when
these
men
were
testifying
that
there
was
no
embargo,
i
don't
know
what
the
context
of
that
testimony
is.
i'm
interested
in
the
facts,
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
attacked
that
testimony.
justice
abe
fortas
you
do
not
want
us
to
get
the
impression
that
they
falsely
testified
that
there
was
no
embargo
in
england
during
the
damage
period.
you
don't
want
to
convey
that.
justice
abe
fortas
i
am
familiar
with
that
point
and
i
understand
that
point.
i
just
did
not
understand
your
previous
argument.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
chadwell,
i
--
based
on
some
experience,
may
i
ask
you
really,
in
the
subs
--
these
people
were
not
cross-examined
in
the
first
trial.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
on
the
second
--
what
you
call
the
second
trial,
which
is
the
production
of
evidence
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
after
the
findings
were
made,
pursuant
to
permission
of
the
court
and,
i
take
it,
your
point
must
be
that,
on
cross-examination
which
is
really
what
it
was,
wasn't
it,
there
was
no
cross-examination
in
the
first
trial
was
this
man?
and
then,
substantially,
on
cross-examination,
these
men
testified,
as
you
have
now
here
narrated
and
perhaps,
in
most,
what
you're
trying
to
say
to
us
is
that
the
things
that
were
brought
out
on
cross-examination
where
more
deviational,
more
deviant
from
what
they
said
on
direct
testimony
than
as
a
common
ordinary
experience
of
lawyers
and
witnesses
in
the
trial
of
cases.
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
because,
every
time
you
examine
a
witness
particularly
on
an
expert
subject
of
this
sort,
you
bring
out
lots
of
facts
that
they
don't
had
duce
on
their
direct
examination.
justice
abe
fortas
before
you
get
to
that,
mr.
kayser
--
before
you
get
to
that,
if
i
may
interrupt
you.
i
take
it
that
what
you're
really
saying
is
that,
with
respect
to
england
on
your
point
two,
as
you've
just
stated
it,
it
says
if
zenith
were
a
stranger
that
this
is
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
that
goes
to
their
desire
to
do
business
in
england,
their
readiness
and
the
ability
to
do
business
in
england
absent
the
alleged
retraints.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
this
evidence,
with
respect
to
the
set
conversion
--
convertibility
of
the
sets,
being
refuted,
there's
no
evidence
in
that
so
--
justice
abe
fortas
so,
it
goes
to
the
question
of
the
fa
--
what
has
been
called
the
fact
of
damages.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
suppose
if
we
should
disagree
with
you
on
that
without
getting
into
the
subtleties
of
that
statement,
if
we
should
disagree
with
you
on
that,
i
take
it
that
neither
you
nor
mr.
chadwell
is
submitting
to
us
that
the
patent
pool
--
you're
not
trying
to
defend
the
legality
under
the
antitrust
laws
of
the
patent
pool
and
of
hazeltine's
participation
in
it.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
you've
made
that
clear.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
i
want
to
be
very
clear
on
one
thing.
are
you
or
are
you
not
arguing
that
the
english
pool,
let's
take
that,
a
and
b,
the
canadian
pool
are
lawful
or
not
unlawful
with
respect
to
the
participation
of
hazeltine
therein?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
adequate.
i
understand
your
language.
i'm
not
asking
you
to
concede
the
illegality
for
it.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
doesn't
matter
one
way
or
the
other,
does
it?
does
it
matter
one
way
or
the
other
with
respect
to
the
outcome
of
this
suit?
justice
abe
fortas
whether
this
suit
grew
out
of
a
domestic
controversy
or
a
controversy
that
enter
its
origins
related
to
the
foreign
countries?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
kayser,
may
i
ask
you
this?
one
of
the
questions
before
us
on
this
branch
of
the
case
could
be
phrased
this
way.
was
there
a
basis
for
the
trial
court
concluding
that,
on
account
of
threats
by
the
pool
to
prevent
the
importation
into
canada
of
products,
zenith
products
manufactured
in
the
united
states,
zenith
was
unable
--
zenith
was
deterred,
prohibited,
prevented,
or
--
from
shipping
its
products
into
canada
and
selling
those
products
there,
number
one.
number
two,
because
of
the
activities
of
the
pool
in
canada,
the
distributor
that
zenith
was
unable
to
obtain
a
full-fledge
distribution
system,
as
you
have
put
it,
and
that
zenith
--
and,
third,
that
was
an
adequate
basis
for
a
district
court
conclusion
that
zenith
wanted
to
and,
but
four
of
the
activities
of
the
pool
either
with
respect
to
prohibiting
forbidding
importation
or
with
respect
to
threats
against
distributors,
zenith
would
have
distributed
and
sold
its
product
in
canada.
should
not
about
what
it
comes
down
to
in
this
branch
of
the
case?
you've
got
two
points.
one,
the
pool
or
the
finding
29
with
respect
to
the
pool
activities
in
prohibiting
importation
of
product
made
in
the
united
states
and,
two,
the
distribution
system.
and,
either
of
those
at
this
remote
distance,
i
suggest
to
you,
arguably
might
support
a
finding
that
the
pool
has
damaged
zenith
in
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
and
then,
the
question
is,
has
it
demonstrated
the
--
what
the
model
damage
is
and,
if
so,
what
is
that?
justice
abe
fortas
but,
as
i
think
my
brother
here
--
was
developed
in
the
colloquy
with
my
brother
white,
the
pool
nevertheless
took
the
position
that
it
would
not
permit
the
importation
of
zenith
products
into
canada.
zenith
could
go
up
there
and
start
a
factory.
but,
however
it
may
be,
i'm
not
asking
you
to
agree
to
the
conclusions
right
now,
mr.
kayser,
but
is
this
the
correct
analysis
of
the
issues
before
us,
that
is
to
say
that
whether
there
is
an
adequate
basis
for
the
district
court's
findings
on
pool
prohibition
of
importation,
whether
there
is
an
adequate
basis
for
what
seem
--
what
is
arguably
implicit
in
the
district
court's
findings,
namely
that
the
pool
threatened
distributors
and,
third,
whether
there's
an
adequate
basis
for
the
finding
that,
but
four
of
these
restraints,
zenith
would
have
sold
its
product
in
canada.
justice
abe
fortas
are
those
the
issues
before
us?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
mcconnell,
i'm
sorry
but
you
--
there
is
an
issue
that's
submitted
to
us,
isn't
there,
as
to
whether
both
hazeltine
corporations
are
bound
here
or
whether
it's
just
a
subsidiary
and
not
the
parent?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
a
difference
on
that?
justice
abe
fortas
i
didn't
really
understand
why
you
made
your
opening
statement
because
there
is
that
issue.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
mcconnell
referred
to
an
annual
report
showing
$14
million
annual
business,
i
gather.
is
that
in
the
same
status
as
the
reports
to
which
you're
referring?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see,
and
you
--
do
you
think
we
can
or
cannot
properly
take
judicial
notice
of
the
report
to
which
he
refers?
justice
abe
fortas
i
said
properly.
