well,
it
could
be
amended,
couldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
during
the
trial
or
during
the
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you're
going
to
argue
the
thing
on
the
basis
that
the
court
might
disagree
with
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
the
rules
were
exceedingly
liberal?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying
now
that
this
offer
was
only
made
after
the
case
was
appealed
and
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it's
still
in
the
trial
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
your
cru
--
that
is
your
main
issue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
support
or
show
you
have
damage.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
report?
who
made
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
license
from
whom?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
pool?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
couldn't
ship
any
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
were
not
licensed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
justified
by
the
law
of
canada?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean,
had
they
passed
a
law
authorizing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
in
canada?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
they
wanted
to
put
a
terrier,
a
prohibitory
terrier
on
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
government?
i'm
talking
about
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
it
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at
was,
was
it
operating
within
authority?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
admitted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
denied?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
of
the
other
side's
take
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
foreclosed
so
far
you
think?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
was
the
injunction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
was
it?
what
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
the
suit
is
filed
against
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean,
infringement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
made
it
on
infringement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
you
say
england,
do
you
mean
canada?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
talking
now
about
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
court
held
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
chadwell,
are
you
emphasizing
the
english
part
of
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
your
adversary
emphasized
the
canadian
part.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
reason
for
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
testify
already
before
the
judge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
heard
their
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
solved
that
immediately.
the
court
of
appeals,
you're
relying
it
on
--
i
don't
want
to
bother
you.
i
understand
that
your
court
of
appeals
that
a
right
to
set
this
is
accepted
and
it
did
so,
on
the
basis
that
you're
arguing
now.
justice
hugo
l.
black
largely
because
of
that
belief
that
these
two
witnesses
in
here
were
not
credible?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
said
largely.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
there
is
a
difference,
is
there
not,
between
the
law
in
england
and
the
law
in
canada
on
that
subject?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
on
the
subject
of
the
importation.
what
could've
bothered
them?
what
could've
kept
them
out
of
canada?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
could've
kept
them
out
of
england?
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
its
difference
with
reference
to
canada.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
canada
or
in
england?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
england,
alright.
you
are
using
all
of
this
as
a
basis
also
to
answer
them
on
canadian
shipments.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
a
little
mixed
up
on
these
things.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
much
--
how
many
millions
in
england
is
the
judgment
and
how
many
millions
in
canada?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
in
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
about
in
canada,
how
much
was
the
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
one
is
bound
to
reach
the
same
judgment
with
reference
to
the
canadian
judgment
and
with
reference
to
the
english
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
we
must
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
you
think
your
argument
is
better
in
one
than
the
other?
why
could
we
not
decided
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
in
one
better
than
in
the
other?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
wouldn't
it
be
justified?
isn't
there
a
difference?
justice
hugo

black
well,
it
could
be
amended,
couldn't
it?
