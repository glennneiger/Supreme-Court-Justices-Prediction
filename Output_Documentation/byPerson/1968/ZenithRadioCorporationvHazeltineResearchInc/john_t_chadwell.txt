mr.
john
t.
chadwell
chief
justice.
may
i
remove
these
papers,
mr.
mcconnell?
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
thank
you.
may
it
please
the
court.
before
starting
on
the
main
part
of
my
argument,
i
would
like
to
get
a
few
basic
points
before
the
court.
the
first
is
that
this
case
was
tried
before
a
district
judge
without
a
jury.
the
second
is
that,
after
the
trial,
zenith
prepared
and
submitted
findings
for
the
judge
to
sign
and
the
judge
signed
every
single
finding
--
every
single
finding
that
he
did
sign
was
a
finding
prepared
by
zenith
and
he
didn't
even
change
a
comment.
the
judge
did
not
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
in
this
case?
well,
it's
unique
so
far
as
the
courts
that
i've
been
practicing
before
is
concerned.
the
court
reversed
on
the
ground
that
the
findings
were
clearly
erroneous.
that
showed
an
impact
on
zenith's
business.
the
court
followed
the
rule
announced
by
this
court
in
gypsum
to
the
effect
that
a
finding
is
clearly
erroneous
and,
although
there
is
evidence
to
support
it,
the
reviewing
court
on
the
entire
evidence
is
left
with
a
definite
and
firm
conviction
that
a
mistake
has
been
committed.
and,
the
court
said
that
that
was
the
situation
with
them
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
now,
mr.
mcconnell
said
nothing
about
england,
although
the
amount
of
damages
awarded
by
the
court
on
the
english
pool
was
approximately
the
same
in
the
neighborhood
of
$15
million.
the
reason,
i
think,
that
mr.
mcconnell
said
nothing
about
england,
the
reason
was
that
the
testimony
in
connection
with
the
english
pool
demonstrated,
i
think,
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
statements
of
mr.
wright,
president
of
zenith,
and
mr.
kaplan,
executive
vice-president
of
zenith
were
not
believable.
and,
in
the
--
in
connection
with
the
analysis
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
record
with
respect
to
england,
that
fact
is
demonstrated.
these
two
men
not
only
testified
with
respect
to
the
english
pool,
they
testified
with
respect
to
impact,
as
mr.
mcconnell
said,
and
with
respect
to
the
amount
of
damage.
they
testified
on
those
subjects
with
respect
to
the
canadian
pool
as
well.
now,
the
zenith
evidence
submitted
by
mr.
wright
through
mr.
wright
and
mr.
kaplan,
is
unbelievable
on
crucial
issues
in
this
case.
it
was
either
repudiated
and
recanted
by
the
witnesses
themselves,
it
was
shown
to
be
incorrect
by
later
evidence
and
undisputed
findings,
or
it
was
directly
contradicted
by
a
contemporaneous
documents
which
are
in
evidence.
now,
in
connection
with
the
english
pool,
the
--
we
went
in
on
a
motion
to
reopen
the
case
as
to
the
english
pool
upon
getting
into
the
case.
and,
we
made
the
motion
on
the
ground
that
we
would
be
able
to
show
that
embargos,
governmental
--
english
governmental
embargos
prohibited
and
made
impossible
the
importation
of
radio
and
television
sets
for
20
years
before
1959
and
there
were,
as
a
result,
two
separate
hearings
as
to
england.
the
first
was
in
1964,
after
which
the
court
entered
finding
36,
read
by
mr.
mcconnell
exactly
as
submitted
by
zenith,
awarding
damages
in
the
amount
of
$24
million.
now,
that
finding
and
that
award
in
england
was
based
upon
testimony
of
these
two
men
as
follows.
i
want
to
briefly
summarize
it
and
then
show
what
they
said
when
they
came
back
on
the
second
trial
which
was
awarded
to
us
limitedly
on
embargos
as
to
england,
but
which
we
were
not
permitted
to
have
as
to
canada.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
no,
sir,
i
mean
england.
you
see,
there
were
three
pools
alleged.
one
was
the
pool
in
england,
one
was
the
pool
in
canada,
one
was
the
pool
in
australia.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
am
talking
now
about
the
english
pool,
about
which
mr.
mcconnell
said
nothing
although
his
judgment
includes
about
$15
million
for
england.
and,
i'm
taking
up
england
first
because
i
think
that
the
testimony
of
these
witnesses
at
the
first
trial
before
findings
were
entered
compared
to
their
testimony
at
the
second
trial
as
to
england,
after
the
court
reopened
on
the
question
of
these
embargos,
shows
that
they
were
not
believable
witnesses,
that
they
were
not
credible
witnesses,
and
the
review
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
entire
record,
i
submit,
brought
out
that
fact.
now
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
expressly
mention
it,
except
that
they
did
refer
to
one
particularly
outrageous
instance
of
it
by
saying
that
zenith's
cause
was
not
helped
by
that
testimony.
they
did
not
expressly
refer
to
the
credibility
of
the
witness
as
otherwise,
although
they
could
not
have
made
--
some
of
the
findings
have
been
made
without
having
serious
doubts,
grave
doubts,
as
to
their
credibility.
and,
i
would
like
to
outline
to
the
court
what
they
said
the
first
time
and
what
they
said
the
second
time,
and
the
extent
to
which
they
were
contradicted
by
contemporaneous
documents.
now,
if
the
court
will
bear
with
me,
i
would
like
to
bring
up
those
two
points.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
i
think
it's
important
that
their
testimony
were
impeached.
i
think,
as
mr.
mcconnell
said,
that
the
--
their
main
contention
was
based
upon
the
testimony
of
these
two
men.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
to
the
--
yes,
we
made
offers
of
proof.
we
made
everything
--
we
offered
everything
that
the
court
would
let
us
offer.
this
is
of
the
second
trial.
now,
if
the
court
will
permit
me
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
we
were
not
at
the
first
trial.
we
went
in
on
a
motion
to
set
aside
the
findings
on
the
ground
that
we
could
show,
as
to
england
now,
we
could
show
that
they
were
kept
out
of
the
pool
for
many
years
before
1959
by
governmental
embargo
and
it
was
the
governmental
embargos
that
kept
them
out.
it
was
not
the
acts
of
the
pools,
and
their
entire
contention
with
respect
to
england
was
that
they
had
been
kept
out
for
many
years
prior
to
1959,
that
if
they
had
been
permitted
to
--
by
the
pools
to
sell
during
that
period,
they
would've
build
up
a
business.
from
which,
they
could've
made
profits
during
the
damage
period
from
1959
to
1963.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
they
testified
at
the
original
hearing
not
only
about
damages.
they
did
testify
about
damages,
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
they
put
on
these
two
men
who
testified
concerning
the
amount
of
damages.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
beg
your
pardon?
i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood
you.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
not
at
the
first
trial.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
at
the
first
trial,
but
it
stands
contradicted
by
their
own
testimony
that
they
gave
at
the
second
hearing.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
i
don't
know
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
i
personally
was
not
at
the
first
trial.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
and
i
can't
say
the
reason
for
it.
i
assume,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
assume
the
reason
was
because
they
didn't,
i
think
--
a
case
had
been
made
up.
i'm
sure
that
was
the
reason.
may
i
say
that
the
--
first,
it
was
said
that
for
many
years,
as
i
said,
zenith
had
tried
to
import
to
england.
on
each
occasion,
it
was
said
the
british
pool
threatened
distributors
until
they
seized
buying
zenith
products.
and,
it
was
claimed
that
zenith
--
that
the
english
pool
had
prevented
zenith
from
building
up
its
market.
they
testified
that
during
the
four-year
period,
1959-1963,
zenith
had
in
fact
attempted
to
market
its
tv
sets
in
england
converted
from
the
american
standard,
the
525-line
standard
in
america,
to
a
unique
british
405-line
system.
they
testified
that
zenith
had
so-converted
its
sets,
and
said
sets
converted
to
its
english
distributor
with
kits
and
parts
to
make
conversions
where
necessary.
they
testified
further
that
the
conversion
was
so
simple.
ramsey,
the
english
distributor,
did
it
in
his
backroom.
that
he
had
made
such
conversions,
had
made
an
effort
to
sell
these
sets
after
the
embargo
was
lifted
in
1959,
but
was
unable
to
do
so
because
he
was
precluded
by
the
pool.
now,
that
was
the
testimony
of
these
men
at
their
--
at
the
first
hearing,
precisely
what
i
have
said.
now,
they
all
--
with
all
--
then,
they
make
two
basic
contentions
by
their
testimony,
that
these
things
had
happened,
that
that's
what
had
hurt
them,
that
that's
how
they
were
damaged.
now,
turning
to
the
first
point
that,
for
many
years
prior
to
1959,
the
pool
had
blocked
zenith's
attempts
to
sell
and
that
they
had
been
unable
to
build
up
a
market.
now,
the
government's
brief,
the
solicitor
general
said
that
this
contention
of
long
exclusion
of
the
pool
was
zenith's
basic
theory
of
recovery
which,
indeed,
it
was.
now,
after
the
court's
findings
were
entered,
as
i
say,
we
file
this
motion.
we
urge
that
we
could
prove
that
there
was
nothing
to
this
contention
with
respect
to
the
impos
--
the
blocking
by
the
pool
in
england
before
1959
where
there's
nothing
it,
we
could
prove
that
government
embargos
was
what
did
it
and
it
was
not
the
pools
at
all.
now,
on
that
motion
and
in
the
course
of
that
argument,
zenith
counsel
denied
that
there
were
any
embargos.
he
objected
to
reopening
the
case
on
the
ground
there
were
no
embargos
and
he
said,
and
i
quote
from
page
3034
--
3035
to
3039
of
the
record,
"there
never
was
an
embargo,
never.
we
can
prove
just
the
opposite."
zenith's
counsel
further
asserted
to
the
trial
court,
"contrary
to
the
representations
made
in
open
court
by
counsel
for
hazeltine,
there
never
has
been
an
embargo,
that
is,
there
never
has
been
a
governmental
prohibition
against
importation
of
radios
and
television
receivers
either
in
england
or
australia."
now,
that's
what
he
argued
to
the
court.
that's
what
he
said
in
opposing
our
motion
to
reopen,
but
the
court
did
reopened
to
enable
us
to
put
in
proof
of
embargos
limited
to
that
question,
and
we
did
put
in
proof
of
the
embargos
and
we
did
show
that
the
embargos
existed
and
that
was
the
reason
we
were
kept
out
of
the
english
pool
for
20
years,
from
1930
--
1920
--
1939
to
1959.
that
was
proof
beyond
a
doubt,
and
the
court
then
held
that
the
iron
curtain
of
the
governmental
embargos
and
nothing
else
kept
zenith
out
of
england
prior
to
june
1959
and
out
of
australia
prior
to
april
1960,
which
was
the
date
of
lifting
the
embargos
of
australia.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
the
trial
judge
held
that.
now,
the
testimony
of
zenith's
witnesses
of
exclusions
by
the
pool
prior
to
1959
was,
thus,
shown
to
be
untrue.
and,
the
government
agrees
that
that
was
what
was
zenith's
basic
theory.
government
agrees
in
their
brief
filed
in
this
court.
what
was
zenith's
basic
theory
was
shown
to
be
without
merit
on
the
basis
of
the
governmental
embargos?
it
was
wright
and
kaplan,
these
two
men
to
whom
mr.
mcconnell
refers.
it
was
wright
and
kaplan
who
led
the
trial
court
to
believe
that
the
pool
had
kept
zenith
out
of
england
during
those
periods,
and
i
would
like
to
make
this
reading
from
the
record,
this
question
on
the
second
trial.
question:
"now,
is
it
a
fact,
mr.
kaplan,"
this
is
cross-examination
by
mr.
kayser,
"that
zenith
has
taken
the
position
from
the
beginning
of
this
litigation
that,
for
many
years,
it
was
excluded
with
a
patent
pool
from
importing
radio
and
television
sets
into
all
three
countries?"
the
court,
well,
it
has
not
only
taken
that
position,
but
they
persuaded
the
court
to
so-find
and
mr.
kaplan
said,
"that
is
correct."
when
mr.
wright
was
recalled
he
said
"now,
you
told
this
court
that
you
had
been
excluded
from
england,
canada,
and
australia
for
many
years
by
the
patent
pools."
answer:
"yes,
sir."
"you
told
this
court
that,
based
on
that
exclusion,
you
were
entitled
to
damages
during
the
statutory
period."
"yes,
sir,
and,
the
fact
is
that
they
were
precluded
and
kept
out
of
england
by
the
embargos
and
nothing
but
the
embargoes."
now,
at
the
second
hearing,
faced
with
proof
of
the
embargos,
they
testified
that
they'd
known
about
the
embargos
all
the
time.
now,
they
hadn't
mentioned
it
at
the
first
trial,
hadn't
mentioned
it.
they
said,
"why,
we
knew
about
that
all
the
time."
mr.
--
zenith
counsel,
at
the
first
--
at
the
--
in
opposing
our
motion
to
reopen,
what
did
he
say?
he
said,
as
i
read
to
the
court,
"there
were
no
embargos.
we
could
prove
that
there
were
no
embargos."
and,
what
did
zenith
official
say
on
recall?
they
said
that
the
matter
had
been
discussed
with
their
attorneys
before
they
testified
at
the
first
trial.
they
--
they'd
so
testify
that
they
had
taken
the
embargos
into
consideration
in
their
first
testimony
and
assumed
that
they
were
a
complete
failure,
although
they
said
nothing
about
it
and
their
counsel,
with
clear
instructions,
had
denied
it.
now,
their
second
contention
that
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir?
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
i
can't
answer
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
they
--
i
assume,
as
i
said
in
a
little
while
ago,
that
the
reason
they
didn't
put
into
evidence
on
that
was
that
they
thought
a
case
had
not
been
made
up
anyway.
so,
they
didn't
do
it.
that,
it
is
a
fact,
that
there
was
no
proof
of
the
embargos
at
the
first
trial.
there
was
in
--
irrefutable
proof
at
the
second
time
after
the
court,
exercising
his
discretion,
after
the
court
had
reopened
and
let
us
put
in
evidence
as
to
this
question,
and
there
was
no
question
about
it
whatsoever.
now
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
that's
right.
he
gave
us
the
judgment
with
respect
to
england,
although
there
were
those
embargos
there
up
to
1959
and,
as
i
shall
say
well
now,
there
was
written
contemporaneous
records,
correspondents
between
mr.
ramsey,
the
english
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
right.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
that's
what
they
did,
but
i
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
no,
i'm
not
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
that's
completely
wrong.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
in
australia,
there
was
an
embargo
from
1951
--
from
1939
until
april
1960.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
the
embargo
there
was
lifted
a
year
or
so
later.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
correct.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
there
was
no
governmental
embargo
during
that
period,
your
honor.
here's
what
there
was.
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
the
precise
facts
are
those
we've
just
stated.
the
embargo
was
until
1959
in
england.
there
was
in
april
1960
in
australia.
now
then,
after
that,
i
would
like
to
point
out
the
second
contention
which
zenith
had
made.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
no.
there
was
--
i'm
not
saying
there
wasn't
embargo
during
the
damage
period,
sir,
no.
during
the
damage
period,
the
facts
are
that
there
was
correspondence
between
the
distributor,
ramsey,
in
england
and
zenith
which
showed
very
clearly
that
the
reason
that
zenith
didn't
import
to
england
during
that
period
was
because
they
didn't
want
to.
they
were
--
they
had
no
intention
of
doing
it.
they
were
waiting
for
the
change
in
the
television
standards.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
well,
the
purpose
of
it
--
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
the
purpose
of
it
was
that
we
tried
to
reopen
the
case,
and
did
reopen
the
case,
to
--
for
the
purpose
of
proving
embargos,
though
they
were
denied.
we
did
that,
and
the
reason
we
did
that
was
that
we
wanted
to
show
that
their
contention
was
incorrect,
that
the
pool
had
been
keeping
them
out,
as
finding
36
said,
the
pool
had
been
keeping
them
out
all
these
years.
the
pool
didn't
keep
them
out.
it
was
the
embargos
that
kept
them
out
from
1939
until
1959.
they
had
contended
that
they
were
--
that
they
--
had
the
pool
not
kept
them
up
--
kept
them
out
all
those
years,
they
would
have
build
up
a
market
in
england
to
a
very
high
level
which
would
have
yielded
them
profits
during
the
damage
period
that
they
were
unable
to
earn.
now,
that
is
the
reason
for
it,
if
the
court
please.
now,
i
want
to
say
this.
this
is
a
point
specifically
mentioned
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
their
contention
was
that
zenith
had
intended
to
import
tv
sets
to
england
beginning
in
1959
but
were
blocked
by
the
pool
and,
as
i
say,
the
testimony
was
the
uncontradicted
documents
or
the
contrary
but
zenith's
counsel
characterized
kaplan's
testimony
as
being
that
he
was
able
to
convert
to
the
english
standard.
he
was
able
to
convert
from
the
525-line
to
the
409-line
and
it
was
so
simple
that
ramsey
could
do
it
in
his
backroom
with
a
screwdriver,
as
mr.
mcconnell
characterizes,
that
they
were
converting
these
american-made
sets
to
the
english
standard
throughout
the
damage
period
and
that
they
were
trying
to
sell
them,
but
couldn't
sell
them
because
of
the
activities
of
the
pool.
now,
on
recall,
they
were
forced
to
say,
contrary
what
they
had
said
at
the
first
hearing,
no
television
sets
had
been
converted
by
zenith
to
the
english
5
--
405-line
standard,
no
conversion
kits
had
been
furnished
to
ramsey,
as
they
had
said,
no
sets
had
been
adopted
by
the
english
distributor
to
the
english
405-line
standard,
and
no
sets
had
been
offered
by
zenith
in
the
english
market
at
all.
now,
i
think
this
testimony
of
mr.
wright,
when
confronted
with
this
testimony
he
had
given
at
the
first
trial
compared
to
what
he
said
at
the
second
trial,
is
revealing.
question:
"when
you
told
the
court
back
in
1964
that
zenith
had
sent
a
few
television
sets
to
mr.
ramsey
which
he
had
attempted
to
market,
you
did
not
know
whether
or
not
those
sets
were
equipped
to
receive
english
television?"
"no,
sir,
i
did
not."
"when
you
told
the
court
that
mr.
ramsey
had
attempted
to
market
these
sets,
did
you
know
whether
or
not
he
did
in
fact
attempt
to
market
them?"
answer:
"i
did
not
know
specifically
what
he
had
done."
now,
the
government
agrees
that
there
were
variations
in
the
testimony
of
these
men.
i'm
talking
about
the
solicitor
general's
brief
now,
that
there
were
variations
in
their
testimony,
that
they
had
modified
their
testimony
by
the
1965
assertions,
and
the
solicitor
general
states
that
this
change
in
their
testimony
could
justify
the
conclusion
for
the
trial
court
that
other
aspects
of
their
testimony
were
also
unworthy
of
relief.
now,
in
zenith's
brief
to
this
court,
and
i'm
referring
to
their
--
to
pages
86-88,
they
quote
from
the
some
of
the
same
discredited
testimony
about
the
distributor
converting
sets
and
asserts
"there
was
no
denial
of
this
testimony
and
there
is
no
other
evidence
in
this
record
on
the
issue
where
the
other
evidence
in
the
record
on
the
issue
is
their
recanting
the
testimony
when
they
got
to
trial
the
second
time."
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
they
were
in
the
second
trial.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
it
certainly
is,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
true,
but
i
submit
to
the
--
to
your
honor
that
when
they
make
statements
that
are
as
flat
as
these
were,
both
times,
is
something
more
than
you'd
normally
expect
to
get
by
some
modification
of
their
testimony.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
right.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
think
the
reason
is
that,
when
i
started
out,
i
wanted
to
show
how
they
had
buried
their
testimony
with
respect
to
the
english
part
and
where
we
had
a
second
hearing
or
an
additional
hearing
and
did
not
have
one
on
the
canadian
part.
i
wanted
to
show
that
because
i
think
that
has
a
bearing
--
had
a
bearing
on
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
reverse
after
reviewing
the
entire
record.
of
course,
i
think
the
court
had
serious
question
as
to
the
credibility
of
these
witnesses
after
noting
the
differences
in
their
testimony
at
the
two
hearings.
now
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
as
i
said,
mr.
chief
justice,
they
did
not
say
so
except
with
respect
to
the
second
point
and,
on
that,
they
said
that
zenith
didn't
gain
anything
by
putting
in
this
testimony
concerning
convertibility
of
such.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
they
did.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
it
did,
but
--
now,
that
judgment
with
respect
to
england,
mr.
kayser
is
going
to
cover
canada.
it's
the
reason
i'm
not
doing
that.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
but
that
testimony
with
respect
to
england
was
all
important
to
the
two
there.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
there
--
yes,
sir,
and
the
reason
is
that
there,
as
i
said
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
no.
they
did
not
assume
the
testimony
is
correct.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
held
that
the
real
reason
that
zenith
did
not
export
to
england
was
that
they
were
waiting
for
a
change
by
the
british
government
in
the
television
standards
from
the
405
to
the
625-line
which
was
an
exceedingly
important
change
which
made
obsolete
all
the
television
sets,
unless
they
were
converted
at
considerable
expense.
and,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that,
during
the
damage
period,
in
fact,
in
1961
in
the
middle
of
the
damage
period,
ramsey
wrote
to
zenith
and
reported
on
the
continued
testing
and
examination
of
the
625-line
standard.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
no,
sir,
and
that
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
and
that
is
a
point
that
i
would
like
to
discuss,
which
you've
just
briefed,
although
mr.
mcconnell
did
not
refer
to
it.
i
think
that
the
court
was
right
in
relying
upon
the
decision
of
the
gypsum
case
that
a
finding
is
clearly
erroneous
when,
although
there
is
evidence
to
support
it,
the
reviewing
court
on
the
entire
record
is
left
with
a
definite
and
firm
conviction
that
a
mistake
has
been
committed.
now,
that
is
the
rule
that
has
been
followed
in
the
question
of
the
power
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
reverse
a
decision
of
the
trial
court
since
the
dupont
decision
which,
i
believe,
was
some-25
years
ago.
now,
the
contention
is
raised
here
that
the
jury
rule
should
apply
in
this
case
despite
the
fact
that
this
was
a
case
tried
by
the
court
and
without
a
jury.
the
--
mr.
mcconnell
also
has
made
that
contention
and
that,
i
assume,
is
--
and
i
think
also
the
suggestion
of
the
solicitor
general.
but,
for
the
--
there's
no
doubt
at
all
that
rule
52
(a)
makes
the
provision
that
i've
referred
to.
there's
no
doubt
at
all
that,
under
the
decision
in
the
gypsum
case,
the
rule
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
the
right
to
reverse
even
though
there's
some
evidence
to
support
the
findings
when
they're
left
with
this
definite
and
firm
conviction
that
a
mistake
has
been
committed,
and
the
court
said
--
stated
that
it
was
left
with
the
definite
and
firm
commitment
--
conviction
that
a
mistake
had
been
committed.
and,
i
must
say,
that
the
government,
as
much
as
it
admits,
that
applying
the
standard
--
the
established
standard
under
52
(a)
as
gov
--
as
stated
in
the
gypsum
case
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
in
reversing
on
that
ground
if
you
assume
that
that
ground
is
the
correct
one.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir,
they
did.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
he
heard
their
evidence.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
i
don't
think
it
was
only
that,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
i
think
another
very
important
point
to
this
--
to
the
court
of
appeals,
in
fact
they
said
so,
is
that
there
was
the
delay
in
--
or
complete
failure
to
do
anything
about
shipping
sets
to
england
because
they
were
awaiting
the
change
of
the
625-line
broadcast
system,
and
the
correspondent
shows
that,
the
contemporaneous
correspondent
shows
it
without
any
question
of
a
doubt.
that's
what
they
wrote
back
and
forth
about
it.
finally,
there
was
a
firm
statement
by
mr.
ramsey
that
that
--
they
could
not
import
and
sell
until
the
change
was
made.
nothing
could
be
clearer
that
there
was
a
contemporaneous
document,
contemporaneous
correspondence
directly
contradicting
and
directly
contrary
to
the
theory
that
zenith
was
interested
in
and
wanted
to
import
to
or
export
to
england
during
the
damage
period.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
on
the
subject
of
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
the
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
the
only
thing
that
could've
kept
them
out
of
england
that
i
know
of
was
their
desire
not
to
go
there
until
there
was
a
shift
in
the
broadcast
standard.
that's
what
the
correspondence
shows.
they
--
the
plaintiff
claims
it
was
the
pool
that
kept
the
out.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
the
government
--
the
plaintiff
claims
that
the
pool
kept
them
out,
but
the
pool
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
they
decided
themselves
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
in
england,
i'm
talking
about.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
no.
mr.
kayser
is
going
to
talk
about
canada.
i
merely
said
that
the
two
witnesses
who
had
testified
with
respect
to
england
also
testified
with
respect
to
canada.
the
reason
that
they
stayed
out
of
england
is
clear.
it's
undenied.
it's
--
it
was
denied
by
mr.
wright.
he
said
he
wasn't
holding
up
until
the
625-line
standard
came
in,
but
the
contemporaneous
correspondence
denies
that.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
it's
approximately
$15
million
in
england
and
--
in
tvs,
plus
about
$2
million
in
radios.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
no,
i
think
it's
13
million
and
2
million.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
$19
million
in
canada.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
your
honor,
in
the
jack
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
in
the
jackson
case,
which
was
just
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
in
1965
and
it's
discussed
at
pages
82-83
of
our
main
brief,
says
that
where
the
--
that
a
question
of
credibility
can't.
it
doesn't
depend
necessarily
entirely
on
demeanor.
it
depends
on
whether
the
testimony
is
inconsistent
with
known
facts
as
well.
it
depends
on
whether
it's
inconsistent
with
contemporaneous
documents.
it
depends
on
whether
it's
inherently
believable.
and,
if
the
court
of
appeals
reaches
that
--
reaches
the
conclusion
against
it
on
those
theories
without
respect
or
regard
to
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
no,
i
say
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
the
statement
i
just
made
was
he
only
one.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
think
they
were
wholly
justified
in
doing
so.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
think
you
apply
the
standard
of
the
dupont
case
that
i
stated.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i'm
sorry,
the
gypsum
case,
yes.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
you
have
to
redo
what
the
court
of
appeals
did.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
i
think
that
in
order
to
sustain
the
court
of
appeals,
what
they
did,
you
either
accept
their
review
of
the
record
and
their
conclusions
with
respect
to
the
record
or
you've
got
to
review
it.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
think
the
same
standard
that
they
tested
it
against.
they
te
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
i
think
the
question
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
followed
the
test
that
it
laid
down
with
this
court
in
gypsum.
that's
what
they
did,
i
think.
that's
what
they
said
they
did.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
they
said
they
did.
they
said
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
in
a
jury
cast
it's
different.
this
is
a
non-jury
case,
and
i
say
that
rule
52
(a)
plus
the
decision
in
the
gypsum
case
is
what
controls.
and,
i
think
this
court
can
consider
whether
the
court
of
appeals
did
that.
they
said
they
did
it
and
they
have
outlined
in
--
they
have
outlined
in
their
opinion
exactly
what
they
find
as
to
each
one
of
the
three
pools.
all
of
which
is
amply
supported
by
the
record.
in
fact,
i
don't
see
how
the
record
could
point
to
anything
else.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
i
would
think
that
you
would
have
to
do
the
job
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
done
in
order
to
decide
whether
they
were
right
or
wrong
in
what
they
did.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
we
had
--
we
pointed
out
in
our
briefs,
i
think,
what
the
record
shows
on
these
things.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
think
that
there
should
be
no
damages
because
the
evidence
does
not
show
through
findings
or
through
evidence
what
the
damage
should
bon
this
other
theory.
it
does
not
show
it,
and
that
is
--
that's
pointed
out
in
the
government's
brief
where
they're
recommending
remanding
for
further
testimony
on
these
points.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
do
not
disagree.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
we
think
that
it's
--
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
do
that.
we
think
that,
on
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
based
upon
these
contemporaneous
records
as
to
england,
based
upon
the
facts
as
to
canada,
which
mr.
kayser
will
discuss,
and
based
upon
the
fact
that
in
australia
there
was
never
any
effort
to
get
down
there
at
all
to
do
anything.
since
1951,
anyone
could've
had
an
import
license
into
australia.
there's
been
no
problem
about
it
whatsoever.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
think
you've
got
to
consider
it
against
the
other
testimony
in
the
record
and
the
other
facts.
i
don't
see,
as
to
england,
how
in
the
world
the
general
statements
of
these
men
can
be
credited
against
or
over
contemporaneous
documents
exactly
to
the
contrary.
that's
what
exists
here.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
that's
right,
and
that
show
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
during
the
damage
period.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
they
--
damage
period.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
because
that
testimony
is
contradicted
by
their
contemporaneous
documents
to
the
contrary,
as
i
have
just
said.
there,
there's
correspondence.
in
1961,
60
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
they
came
in
from
1950
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
into
this
record?
they
were
offered
by
zenith
counsel
in
a
bulk,
a
package,
at
the
first
hearing.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
they
were
admitted
then.
and,
there
are
a
great
many
of
these
letters
and
we
cite
them
in
our
brief.
there
are
some
that
we've
made
an
offer
of
proof
with
respect
to
because
they
had
not
been
introduced.
there
in
the
records
as
an
offer
of
proof,
the
documents
that
i
just
referred
to,
written
in
1961,
in
which
it
was
said
that
we
can't
start
selling
in
england
until
they
change
the
broadcast
standard
to
625-line.
that
was
--
that's
in
evidence
and
was
put
in
evidence
by
zenith
counsel.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
i
think
this
court
could
certainly
do
that.
it
seems
to
me
that
on
the
record,
as
i
have
stated
--
speaking
now
about
england,
on
that
record,
as
i
have
stated,
that
you've
got
to
weigh
the
contemporaneous
documents
against
what
they
said
and,
when
you
weigh
the
two,
i
don't
see
how
the
court
could
come
to
any
conclusion,
except
that
which
the
court
of
appeals
did
come
to.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
i
think
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
of
course,
you
could,
but
i
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
they
are
entirely
different.
they're
entirely
different.
they're
not
the
same
pool.
you
could
--
the
court
could
certainly
do
that,
but
i
don't
think
the
court
should
do
that
and
mr.
kayser
will
resume
--
will
finish
our
argument
dealing
with
canada.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
chief
justice.
may
i
remove
these
papers,
mr.
mcconnell?
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
thank
you.
may
it
please
the
court.
before
starting
on
the
main
part
of
my
argument,
i
would
like
to
get
a
few
basic
points
before
the
court.
the
first
is
that
this
case
was
tried
before
a
district
judge
without
a
jury.
the
second
is
that,
after
the
trial,
zenith
prepared
and
submitted
findings
for
the
judge
to
sign
and
the
judge
signed
every
single
finding
--
every
single
finding
that
he
did
sign
was
a
finding
prepared
by
zenith
and
he
didn't
even
change
a
comment.
the
judge
did
not
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
in
this
case?
well,
it's
unique
so
far
as
the
courts
that
i've
been
practicing
before
is
concerned.
the
court
reversed
on
the
ground
that
the
findings
were
clearly
erroneous.
that
showed
an
impact
on
zenith's
business.
the
court
followed
the
rule
announced
by
this
court
in
gypsum
to
the
effect
that
a
finding
is
clearly
erroneous
and,
although
there
is
evidence
to
support
it,
the
reviewing
court
on
the
entire
evidence
is
left
with
a
definite
and
firm
conviction
that
a
mistake
has
been
committed.
and,
the
court
said
that
that
was
the
situation
with
them
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
now,
mr.
mcconnell
said
nothing
about
england,
although
the
amount
of
damages
awarded
by
the
court
on
the
english
pool
was
approximately
the
same
in
the
neighborhood
of
$15
million.
the
reason,
i
think,
that
mr.
mcconnell
said
nothing
about
england,
the
reason
was
that
the
testimony
in
connection
with
the
english
pool
demonstrated,
i
think,
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
statements
of
mr.
wright,
president
of
zenith,
and
mr.
kaplan,
executive
vice-president
of
zenith
were
not
believable.
and,
in
the
--
in
connection
with
the
analysis
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
record
with
respect
to
england,
that
fact
is
demonstrated.
these
two
men
not
only
testified
with
respect
to
the
english
pool,
they
testified
with
respect
to
impact,
as
mr.
mcconnell
said,
and
with
respect
to
the
amount
of
damage.
they
testified
on
those
subjects
with
respect
to
the
canadian
pool
as
well.
now,
the
zenith
evidence
submitted
by
mr.
wright
through
mr.
wright
and
mr.
kaplan,
is
unbelievable
on
crucial
issues
in
this
case.
it
was
either
repudiated
and
recanted
by
the
witnesses
themselves,
it
was
shown
to
be
incorrect
by
later
evidence
and
undisputed
findings,
or
it
was
directly
contradicted
by
a
contemporaneous
documents
which
are
in
evidence.
now,
in
connection
with
the
english
pool,
the
--
we
went
in
on
a
motion
to
reopen
the
case
as
to
the
english
pool
upon
getting
into
the
case.
and,
we
made
the
motion
on
the
ground
that
we
would
be
able
to
show
that
embargos,
governmental
--
english
governmental
embargos
prohibited
and
made
impossible
the
importation
of
radio
and
television
sets
for
20
years
before
1959
and
there
were,
as
a
result,
two
separate
hearings
as
to
england.
the
first
was
in
1964,
after
which
the
court
entered
finding
36,
read
by
mr.
mcconnell
exactly
as
submitted
by
zenith,
awarding
damages
in
the
amount
of
$24
million.
now,
that
finding
and
that
award
in
england
was
based
upon
testimony
of
these
two
men
as
follows.
i
want
to
briefly
summarize
it
and
then
show
what
they
said
when
they
came
back
on
the
second
trial
which
was
awarded
to
us
limitedly
on
embargos
as
to
england,
but
which
we
were
not
permitted
to
have
as
to
canada.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
no,
sir,
i
mean
england.
you
see,
there
were
three
pools
alleged.
one
was
the
pool
in
england,
one
was
the
pool
in
canada,
one
was
the
pool
in
australia.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
am
talking
now
about
the
english
pool,
about
which
mr.
mcconnell
said
nothing
although
his
judgment
includes
about
$15
million
for
england.
and,
i'm
taking
up
england
first
because
i
think
that
the
testimony
of
these
witnesses
at
the
first
trial
before
findings
were
entered
compared
to
their
testimony
at
the
second
trial
as
to
england,
after
the
court
reopened
on
the
question
of
these
embargos,
shows
that
they
were
not
believable
witnesses,
that
they
were
not
credible
witnesses,
and
the
review
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
entire
record,
i
submit,
brought
out
that
fact.
now
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
expressly
mention
it,
except
that
they
did
refer
to
one
particularly
outrageous
instance
of
it
by
saying
that
zenith's
cause
was
not
helped
by
that
testimony.
they
did
not
expressly
refer
to
the
credibility
of
the
witness
as
otherwise,
although
they
could
not
have
made
--
some
of
the
findings
have
been
made
without
having
serious
doubts,
grave
doubts,
as
to
their
credibility.
and,
i
would
like
to
outline
to
the
court
what
they
said
the
first
time
and
what
they
said
the
second
time,
and
the
extent
to
which
they
were
contradicted
by
contemporaneous
documents.
now,
if
the
court
will
bear
with
me,
i
would
like
to
bring
up
those
two
points.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
i
think
it's
important
that
their
testimony
were
impeached.
i
think,
as
mr.
mcconnell
said,
that
the
--
their
main
contention
was
based
upon
the
testimony
of
these
two
men.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
to
the
--
yes,
we
made
offers
of
proof.
we
made
everything
--
we
offered
everything
that
the
court
would
let
us
offer.
this
is
of
the
second
trial.
now,
if
the
court
will
permit
me
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
we
were
not
at
the
first
trial.
we
went
in
on
a
motion
to
set
aside
the
findings
on
the
ground
that
we
could
show,
as
to
england
now,
we
could
show
that
they
were
kept
out
of
the
pool
for
many
years
before
1959
by
governmental
embargo
and
it
was
the
governmental
embargos
that
kept
them
out.
it
was
not
the
acts
of
the
pools,
and
their
entire
contention
with
respect
to
england
was
that
they
had
been
kept
out
for
many
years
prior
to
1959,
that
if
they
had
been
permitted
to
--
by
the
pools
to
sell
during
that
period,
they
would've
build
up
a
business.
from
which,
they
could've
made
profits
during
the
damage
period
from
1959
to
1963.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
they
testified
at
the
original
hearing
not
only
about
damages.
they
did
testify
about
damages,
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
they
put
on
these
two
men
who
testified
concerning
the
amount
of
damages.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
beg
your
pardon?
i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood
you.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
not
at
the
first
trial.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
at
the
first
trial,
but
it
stands
contradicted
by
their
own
testimony
that
they
gave
at
the
second
hearing.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
i
don't
know
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
i
personally
was
not
at
the
first
trial.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
and
i
can't
say
the
reason
for
it.
i
assume,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
assume
the
reason
was
because
they
didn't,
i
think
--
a
case
had
been
made
up.
i'm
sure
that
was
the
reason.
may
i
say
that
the
--
first,
it
was
said
that
for
many
years,
as
i
said,
zenith
had
tried
to
import
to
england.
on
each
occasion,
it
was
said
the
british
pool
threatened
distributors
until
they
seized
buying
zenith
products.
and,
it
was
claimed
that
zenith
--
that
the
english
pool
had
prevented
zenith
from
building
up
its
market.
they
testified
that
during
the
four-year
period,
1959-1963,
zenith
had
in
fact
attempted
to
market
its
tv
sets
in
england
converted
from
the
american
standard,
the
525-line
standard
in
america,
to
a
unique
british
405-line
system.
they
testified
that
zenith
had
so-converted
its
sets,
and
said
sets
converted
to
its
english
distributor
with
kits
and
parts
to
make
conversions
where
necessary.
they
testified
further
that
the
conversion
was
so
simple.
ramsey,
the
english
distributor,
did
it
in
his
backroom.
that
he
had
made
such
conversions,
had
made
an
effort
to
sell
these
sets
after
the
embargo
was
lifted
in
1959,
but
was
unable
to
do
so
because
he
was
precluded
by
the
pool.
now,
that
was
the
testimony
of
these
men
at
their
--
at
the
first
hearing,
precisely
what
i
have
said.
now,
they
all
--
with
all
--
then,
they
make
two
basic
contentions
by
their
testimony,
that
these
things
had
happened,
that
that's
what
had
hurt
them,
that
that's
how
they
were
damaged.
now,
turning
to
the
first
point
that,
for
many
years
prior
to
1959,
the
pool
had
blocked
zenith's
attempts
to
sell
and
that
they
had
been
unable
to
build
up
a
market.
now,
the
government's
brief,
the
solicitor
general
said
that
this
contention
of
long
exclusion
of
the
pool
was
zenith's
basic
theory
of
recovery
which,
indeed,
it
was.
now,
after
the
court's
findings
were
entered,
as
i
say,
we
file
this
motion.
we
urge
that
we
could
prove
that
there
was
nothing
to
this
contention
with
respect
to
the
impos
--
the
blocking
by
the
pool
in
england
before
1959
where
there's
nothing
it,
we
could
prove
that
government
embargos
was
what
did
it
and
it
was
not
the
pools
at
all.
now,
on
that
motion
and
in
the
course
of
that
argument,
zenith
counsel
denied
that
there
were
any
embargos.
he
objected
to
reopening
the
case
on
the
ground
there
were
no
embargos
and
he
said,
and
i
quote
from
page
3034
--
3035
to
3039
of
the
record,
"there
never
was
an
embargo,
never.
we
can
prove
just
the
opposite."
zenith's
counsel
further
asserted
to
the
trial
court,
"contrary
to
the
representations
made
in
open
court
by
counsel
for
hazeltine,
there
never
has
been
an
embargo,
that
is,
there
never
has
been
a
governmental
prohibition
against
importation
of
radios
and
television
receivers
either
in
england
or
australia."
now,
that's
what
he
argued
to
the
court.
that's
what
he
said
in
opposing
our
motion
to
reopen,
but
the
court
did
reopened
to
enable
us
to
put
in
proof
of
embargos
limited
to
that
question,
and
we
did
put
in
proof
of
the
embargos
and
we
did
show
that
the
embargos
existed
and
that
was
the
reason
we
were
kept
out
of
the
english
pool
for
20
years,
from
1930
--
1920
--
1939
to
1959.
that
was
proof
beyond
a
doubt,
and
the
court
then
held
that
the
iron
curtain
of
the
governmental
embargos
and
nothing
else
kept
zenith
out
of
england
prior
to
june
1959
and
out
of
australia
prior
to
april
1960,
which
was
the
date
of
lifting
the
embargos
of
australia.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
the
trial
judge
held
that.
now,
the
testimony
of
zenith's
witnesses
of
exclusions
by
the
pool
prior
to
1959
was,
thus,
shown
to
be
untrue.
and,
the
government
agrees
that
that
was
what
was
zenith's
basic
theory.
government
agrees
in
their
brief
filed
in
this
court.
what
was
zenith's
basic
theory
was
shown
to
be
without
merit
on
the
basis
of
the
governmental
embargos?
it
was
wright
and
kaplan,
these
two
men
to
whom
mr.
mcconnell
refers.
it
was
wright
and
kaplan
who
led
the
trial
court
to
believe
that
the
pool
had
kept
zenith
out
of
england
during
those
periods,
and
i
would
like
to
make
this
reading
from
the
record,
this
question
on
the
second
trial.
question:
"now,
is
it
a
fact,
mr.
kaplan,"
this
is
cross-examination
by
mr.
kayser,
"that
zenith
has
taken
the
position
from
the
beginning
of
this
litigation
that,
for
many
years,
it
was
excluded
with
a
patent
pool
from
importing
radio
and
television
sets
into
all
three
countries?"
the
court,
well,
it
has
not
only
taken
that
position,
but
they
persuaded
the
court
to
so-find
and
mr.
kaplan
said,
"that
is
correct."
when
mr.
wright
was
recalled
he
said
"now,
you
told
this
court
that
you
had
been
excluded
from
england,
canada,
and
australia
for
many
years
by
the
patent
pools."
answer:
"yes,
sir."
"you
told
this
court
that,
based
on
that
exclusion,
you
were
entitled
to
damages
during
the
statutory
period."
"yes,
sir,
and,
the
fact
is
that
they
were
precluded
and
kept
out
of
england
by
the
embargos
and
nothing
but
the
embargoes."
now,
at
the
second
hearing,
faced
with
proof
of
the
embargos,
they
testified
that
they'd
known
about
the
embargos
all
the
time.
now,
they
hadn't
mentioned
it
at
the
first
trial,
hadn't
mentioned
it.
they
said,
"why,
we
knew
about
that
all
the
time."
mr.
--
zenith
counsel,
at
the
first
--
at
the
--
in
opposing
our
motion
to
reopen,
what
did
he
say?
he
said,
as
i
read
to
the
court,
"there
were
no
embargos.
we
could
prove
that
there
were
no
embargos."
and,
what
did
zenith
official
say
on
recall?
they
said
that
the
matter
had
been
discussed
with
their
attorneys
before
they
testified
at
the
first
trial.
they
--
they'd
so
testify
that
they
had
taken
the
embargos
into
consideration
in
their
first
testimony
and
assumed
that
they
were
a
complete
failure,
although
they
said
nothing
about
it
and
their
counsel,
with
clear
instructions,
had
denied
it.
now,
their
second
contention
that
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir?
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
i
can't
answer
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
they
--
i
assume,
as
i
said
in
a
little
while
ago,
that
the
reason
they
didn't
put
into
evidence
on
that
was
that
they
thought
a
case
had
not
been
made
up
anyway.
so,
they
didn't
do
it.
that,
it
is
a
fact,
that
there
was
no
proof
of
the
embargos
at
the
first
trial.
there
was
in
--
irrefutable
proof
at
the
second
time
after
the
court,
exercising
his
discretion,
after
the
court
had
reopened
and
let
us
put
in
evidence
as
to
this
question,
and
there
was
no
question
about
it
whatsoever.
now
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
that's
right.
he
gave
us
the
judgment
with
respect
to
england,
although
there
were
those
embargos
there
up
to
1959
and,
as
i
shall
say
well
now,
there
was
written
contemporaneous
records,
correspondents
between
mr.
ramsey,
the
english
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
right.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
that's
what
they
did,
but
i
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
no,
i'm
not
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
that's
completely
wrong.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
in
australia,
there
was
an
embargo
from
1951
--
from
1939
until
april
1960.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
the
embargo
there
was
lifted
a
year
or
so
later.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
correct.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
there
was
no
governmental
embargo
during
that
period,
your
honor.
here's
what
there
was.
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
the
precise
facts
are
those
we've
just
stated.
the
embargo
was
until
1959
in
england.
there
was
in
april
1960
in
australia.
now
then,
after
that,
i
would
like
to
point
out
the
second
contention
which
zenith
had
made.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
no.
there
was
--
i'm
not
saying
there
wasn't
embargo
during
the
damage
period,
sir,
no.
during
the
damage
period,
the
facts
are
that
there
was
correspondence
between
the
distributor,
ramsey,
in
england
and
zenith
which
showed
very
clearly
that
the
reason
that
zenith
didn't
import
to
england
during
that
period
was
because
they
didn't
want
to.
they
were
--
they
had
no
intention
of
doing
it.
they
were
waiting
for
the
change
in
the
television
standards.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
well,
the
purpose
of
it
--
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
the
purpose
of
it
was
that
we
tried
to
reopen
the
case,
and
did
reopen
the
case,
to
--
for
the
purpose
of
proving
embargos,
though
they
were
denied.
we
did
that,
and
the
reason
we
did
that
was
that
we
wanted
to
show
that
their
contention
was
incorrect,
that
the
pool
had
been
keeping
them
out,
as
finding
36
said,
the
pool
had
been
keeping
them
out
all
these
years.
the
pool
didn't
keep
them
out.
it
was
the
embargos
that
kept
them
out
from
1939
until
1959.
they
had
contended
that
they
were
--
that
they
--
had
the
pool
not
kept
them
up
--
kept
them
out
all
those
years,
they
would
have
build
up
a
market
in
england
to
a
very
high
level
which
would
have
yielded
them
profits
during
the
damage
period
that
they
were
unable
to
earn.
now,
that
is
the
reason
for
it,
if
the
court
please.
now,
i
want
to
say
this.
this
is
a
point
specifically
mentioned
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
their
contention
was
that
zenith
had
intended
to
import
tv
sets
to
england
beginning
in
1959
but
were
blocked
by
the
pool
and,
as
i
say,
the
testimony
was
the
uncontradicted
documents
or
the
contrary
but
zenith's
counsel
characterized
kaplan's
testimony
as
being
that
he
was
able
to
convert
to
the
english
standard.
he
was
able
to
convert
from
the
525-line
to
the
409-line
and
it
was
so
simple
that
ramsey
could
do
it
in
his
backroom
with
a
screwdriver,
as
mr.
mcconnell
characterizes,
that
they
were
converting
these
american-made
sets
to
the
english
standard
throughout
the
damage
period
and
that
they
were
trying
to
sell
them,
but
couldn't
sell
them
because
of
the
activities
of
the
pool.
now,
on
recall,
they
were
forced
to
say,
contrary
what
they
had
said
at
the
first
hearing,
no
television
sets
had
been
converted
by
zenith
to
the
english
5
--
405-line
standard,
no
conversion
kits
had
been
furnished
to
ramsey,
as
they
had
said,
no
sets
had
been
adopted
by
the
english
distributor
to
the
english
405-line
standard,
and
no
sets
had
been
offered
by
zenith
in
the
english
market
at
all.
now,
i
think
this
testimony
of
mr.
wright,
when
confronted
with
this
testimony
he
had
given
at
the
first
trial
compared
to
what
he
said
at
the
second
trial,
is
revealing.
question:
"when
you
told
the
court
back
in
1964
that
zenith
had
sent
a
few
television
sets
to
mr.
ramsey
which
he
had
attempted
to
market,
you
did
not
know
whether
or
not
those
sets
were
equipped
to
receive
english
television?"
"no,
sir,
i
did
not."
"when
you
told
the
court
that
mr.
ramsey
had
attempted
to
market
these
sets,
did
you
know
whether
or
not
he
did
in
fact
attempt
to
market
them?"
answer:
"i
did
not
know
specifically
what
he
had
done."
now,
the
government
agrees
that
there
were
variations
in
the
testimony
of
these
men.
i'm
talking
about
the
solicitor
general's
brief
now,
that
there
were
variations
in
their
testimony,
that
they
had
modified
their
testimony
by
the
1965
assertions,
and
the
solicitor
general
states
that
this
change
in
their
testimony
could
justify
the
conclusion
for
the
trial
court
that
other
aspects
of
their
testimony
were
also
unworthy
of
relief.
now,
in
zenith's
brief
to
this
court,
and
i'm
referring
to
their
--
to
pages
86-88,
they
quote
from
the
some
of
the
same
discredited
testimony
about
the
distributor
converting
sets
and
asserts
"there
was
no
denial
of
this
testimony
and
there
is
no
other
evidence
in
this
record
on
the
issue
where
the
other
evidence
in
the
record
on
the
issue
is
their
recanting
the
testimony
when
they
got
to
trial
the
second
time."
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
they
were
in
the
second
trial.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
it
certainly
is,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
true,
but
i
submit
to
the
--
to
your
honor
that
when
they
make
statements
that
are
as
flat
as
these
were,
both
times,
is
something
more
than
you'd
normally
expect
to
get
by
some
modification
of
their
testimony.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
right.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
think
the
reason
is
that,
when
i
started
out,
i
wanted
to
show
how
they
had
buried
their
testimony
with
respect
to
the
english
part
and
where
we
had
a
second
hearing
or
an
additional
hearing
and
did
not
have
one
on
the
canadian
part.
i
wanted
to
show
that
because
i
think
that
has
a
bearing
--
had
a
bearing
on
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
reverse
after
reviewing
the
entire
record.
of
course,
i
think
the
court
had
serious
question
as
to
the
credibility
of
these
witnesses
after
noting
the
differences
in
their
testimony
at
the
two
hearings.
now
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
as
i
said,
mr.
chief
justice,
they
did
not
say
so
except
with
respect
to
the
second
point
and,
on
that,
they
said
that
zenith
didn't
gain
anything
by
putting
in
this
testimony
concerning
convertibility
of
such.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
they
did.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
it
did,
but
--
now,
that
judgment
with
respect
to
england,
mr.
kayser
is
going
to
cover
canada.
it's
the
reason
i'm
not
doing
that.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
but
that
testimony
with
respect
to
england
was
all
important
to
the
two
there.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
there
--
yes,
sir,
and
the
reason
is
that
there,
as
i
said
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
no.
they
did
not
assume
the
testimony
is
correct.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
held
that
the
real
reason
that
zenith
did
not
export
to
england
was
that
they
were
waiting
for
a
change
by
the
british
government
in
the
television
standards
from
the
405
to
the
625-line
which
was
an
exceedingly
important
change
which
made
obsolete
all
the
television
sets,
unless
they
were
converted
at
considerable
expense.
and,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that,
during
the
damage
period,
in
fact,
in
1961
in
the
middle
of
the
damage
period,
ramsey
wrote
to
zenith
and
reported
on
the
continued
testing
and
examination
of
the
625-line
standard.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
no,
sir,
and
that
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
and
that
is
a
point
that
i
would
like
to
discuss,
which
you've
just
briefed,
although
mr.
mcconnell
did
not
refer
to
it.
i
think
that
the
court
was
right
in
relying
upon
the
decision
of
the
gypsum
case
that
a
finding
is
clearly
erroneous
when,
although
there
is
evidence
to
support
it,
the
reviewing
court
on
the
entire
record
is
left
with
a
definite
and
firm
conviction
that
a
mistake
has
been
committed.
now,
that
is
the
rule
that
has
been
followed
in
the
question
of
the
power
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
reverse
a
decision
of
the
trial
court
since
the
dupont
decision
which,
i
believe,
was
some-25
years
ago.
now,
the
contention
is
raised
here
that
the
jury
rule
should
apply
in
this
case
despite
the
fact
that
this
was
a
case
tried
by
the
court
and
without
a
jury.
the
--
mr.
mcconnell
also
has
made
that
contention
and
that,
i
assume,
is
--
and
i
think
also
the
suggestion
of
the
solicitor
general.
but,
for
the
--
there's
no
doubt
at
all
that
rule
52
(a)
makes
the
provision
that
i've
referred
to.
there's
no
doubt
at
all
that,
under
the
decision
in
the
gypsum
case,
the
rule
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
the
right
to
reverse
even
though
there's
some
evidence
to
support
the
findings
when
they're
left
with
this
definite
and
firm
conviction
that
a
mistake
has
been
committed,
and
the
court
said
--
stated
that
it
was
left
with
the
definite
and
firm
commitment
--
conviction
that
a
mistake
had
been
committed.
and,
i
must
say,
that
the
government,
as
much
as
it
admits,
that
applying
the
standard
--
the
established
standard
under
52
(a)
as
gov
--
as
stated
in
the
gypsum
case
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
in
reversing
on
that
ground
if
you
assume
that
that
ground
is
the
correct
one.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir,
they
did.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
he
heard
their
evidence.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
i
don't
think
it
was
only
that,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
i
think
another
very
important
point
to
this
--
to
the
court
of
appeals,
in
fact
they
said
so,
is
that
there
was
the
delay
in
--
or
complete
failure
to
do
anything
about
shipping
sets
to
england
because
they
were
awaiting
the
change
of
the
625-line
broadcast
system,
and
the
correspondent
shows
that,
the
contemporaneous
correspondent
shows
it
without
any
question
of
a
doubt.
that's
what
they
wrote
back
and
forth
about
it.
finally,
there
was
a
firm
statement
by
mr.
ramsey
that
that
--
they
could
not
import
and
sell
until
the
change
was
made.
nothing
could
be
clearer
that
there
was
a
contemporaneous
document,
contemporaneous
correspondence
directly
contradicting
and
directly
contrary
to
the
theory
that
zenith
was
interested
in
and
wanted
to
import
to
or
export
to
england
during
the
damage
period.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
on
the
subject
of
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
the
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
the
only
thing
that
could've
kept
them
out
of
england
that
i
know
of
was
their
desire
not
to
go
there
until
there
was
a
shift
in
the
broadcast
standard.
that's
what
the
correspondence
shows.
they
--
the
plaintiff
claims
it
was
the
pool
that
kept
the
out.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
the
government
--
the
plaintiff
claims
that
the
pool
kept
them
out,
but
the
pool
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
they
decided
themselves
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
in
england,
i'm
talking
about.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
no.
mr.
kayser
is
going
to
talk
about
canada.
i
merely
said
that
the
two
witnesses
who
had
testified
with
respect
to
england
also
testified
with
respect
to
canada.
the
reason
that
they
stayed
out
of
england
is
clear.
it's
undenied.
it's
--
it
was
denied
by
mr.
wright.
he
said
he
wasn't
holding
up
until
the
625-line
standard
came
in,
but
the
contemporaneous
correspondence
denies
that.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
it's
approximately
$15
million
in
england
and
--
in
tvs,
plus
about
$2
million
in
radios.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
no,
i
think
it's
13
million
and
2
million.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
$19
million
in
canada.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
your
honor,
in
the
jack
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
in
the
jackson
case,
which
was
just
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
in
1965
and
it's

of
our
main
brief,
says
that
where
the
--
that
a
question
of
credibility
can't.
it
doesn't
depend
necessarily
entirely
on
demeanor.
it
depends
on
whether
the
testimony
is
inconsistent
with
known
facts
as
well.
it
depends
on
whether
it's
inconsistent
with
contemporaneous
documents.
it
depends
on
whether
it's
inherently
believable.
and,
if
the
court
of
appeals
reaches
that
--
reaches
the
conclusion
against
it
on
those
theories
without
respect
or
regard
to
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
no,
i
say
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
the
statement
i
just
made
was
he
only
one.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
think
they
were
wholly
justified
in
doing
so.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
think
you
apply
the
standard
of
the
dupont
case
that
i
stated.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i'm
sorry,
the
gypsum
case,
yes.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
you
have
to
redo
what
the
court
of
appeals
did.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
i
think
that
in
order
to
sustain
the
court
of
appeals,
what
they
did,
you
either
accept
their
review
of
the
record
and
their
conclusions
with
respect
to
the
record
or
you've
got
to
review
it.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
think
the
same
standard
that
they
tested
it
against.
they
te
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
i
think
the
question
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
followed
the
test
that
it
laid
down
with
this
court
in
gypsum.
that's
what
they
did,
i
think.
that's
what
they
said
they
did.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
they
said
they
did.
they
said
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
in
a
jury
cast
it's
different.
this
is
a
non-jury
case,
and
i
say
that
rule
52
(a)
plus
the
decision
in
the
gypsum
case
is
what
controls.
and,
i
think
this
court
can
consider
whether
the
court
of
appeals
did
that.
they
said
they
did
it
and
they
have
outlined
in
--
they
have
outlined
in
their
opinion
exactly
what
they
find
as
to
each
one
of
the
three
pools.
all
of
which
is
amply
supported
by
the
record.
in
fact,
i
don't
see
how
the
record
could
point
to
anything
else.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
i
would
think
that
you
would
have
to
do
the
job
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
done
in
order
to
decide
whether
they
were
right
or
wrong
in
what
they
did.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
we
had
--
we
pointed
out
in
our
briefs,
i
think,
what
the
record
shows
on
these
things.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
think
that
there
should
be
no
damages
because
the
evidence
does
not
show
through
findings
or
through
evidence
what
the
damage
should
bon
this
other
theory.
it
does
not
show
it,
and
that
is
--
that's
pointed
out
in
the
government's
brief
where
they're
recommending
remanding
for
further
testimony
on
these
points.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
do
not
disagree.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
we
think
that
it's
--
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
do
that.
we
think
that,
on
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
based
upon
these
contemporaneous
records
as
to
england,
based
upon
the
facts
as
to
canada,
which
mr.
kayser
will
discuss,
and
based
upon
the
fact
that
in
australia
there
was
never
any
effort
to
get
down
there
at
all
to
do
anything.
since
1951,
anyone
could've
had
an
import
license
into
australia.
there's
been
no
problem
about
it
whatsoever.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
think
you've
got
to
consider
it
against
the
other
testimony
in
the
record
and
the
other
facts.
i
don't
see,
as
to
england,
how
in
the
world
the
general
statements
of
these
men
can
be
credited
against
or
over
contemporaneous
documents
exactly
to
the
contrary.
that's
what
exists
here.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
that's
right,
and
that
show
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
during
the
damage
period.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
they
--
damage
period.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
because
that
testimony
is
contradicted
by
their
contemporaneous
documents
to
the
contrary,
as
i
have
just
said.
there,
there's
correspondence.
in
1961,
60
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
they
came
in
from
1950
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
into
this
record?
they
were
offered
by
zenith
counsel
in
a
bulk,
a
package,
at
the
first
hearing.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
they
were
admitted
then.
and,
there
are
a
great
many
of
these
letters
and
we
cite
them
in
our
brief.
there
are
some
that
we've
made
an
offer
of
proof
with
respect
to
because
they
had
not
been
introduced.
there
in
the
records
as
an
offer
of
proof,
the
documents
that
i
just
referred
to,
written
in
1961,
in
which
it
was
said
that
we
can't
start
selling
in
england
until
they
change
the
broadcast
standard
to
625-line.
that
was
--
that's
in
evidence
and
was
put
in
evidence
by
zenith
counsel.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
i
think
this
court
could
certainly
do
that.
it
seems
to
me
that
on
the
record,
as
i
have
stated
--
speaking
now
about
england,
on
that
record,
as
i
have
stated,
that
you've
got
to
weigh
the
contemporaneous
documents
against
what
they
said
and,
when
you
weigh
the
two,
i
don't
see
how
the
court
could
come
to
any
conclusion,
except
that
which
the
court
of
appeals
did
come
to.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
i
think
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
of
course,
you
could,
but
i
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
they
are
entirely
different.
they're
entirely
different.
they're
not
the
same
pool.
you
could
--
the
court
could
certainly
do
that,
but
i
don't
think
the
court
should
do
that
and
mr.
kayser
will
resume
--
will
finish
our
argument
dealing
with
canada.
