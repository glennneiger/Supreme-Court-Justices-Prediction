mr.
a.
l.
wirin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
ultimate
question
as
we
view
it
is
whether
or
not
the
california
criminal
syndicalism
act
is
unconstitutional
in
violating
the
first
amendment
and
whether
the
district
court
in
so
ruling
was
correct.
but
long
before
that
ultimate
question
is
reached
there
is
concededly
a
serious
threshold
question
and
we
the
appellees
or
particularly
appellee
harris
has
to
succeed
in
crossing
that
threshold
in
order
to
prevail.
the
threshold
question
is
whether
or
not
where
there
is
a
special
procedure
in
a
state
for
the
raising
of
federal
as
well
as
state
constitutional
questions
prior
to
trial
as
there
is
in
state
of
california
and
as
frankly
and
candidly
fairly
stated
by
mr.
harris.
where
there
is
a
special
procedure
for
raising
both
the
constitutionality
of
statute
on
its
face
and
as
applied
and
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
adduce
before
the
grand
jury
in
connection
with
such
statute
and
where
a
defendant
charged
with
an
offense
has
exhausted
every
available
--
first,
where
there's
a
procedure
available
to
him
and
where
he
has
taken
every
step
under
that
procedure
and
having
failed
in
these
steps
to
secure
a
narrowing
of
the
statute
or
a
dismissal
of
the
cases
filing
the
first
amendment
whether
or
not
if
and
in
the
case
involving
only
the
expression
of
opinion,
only
speech
--
pure
speech
unaccompanied
by
plus
or
conduct
or
acts
or
anything
other
than
the
expression
of
opinion.
and
question
is
therefore,
when
a
defendant
in
that
circumstance
under
that
kind
of
a
procedure
in
a
state
court
after
having
failed
to
secure
narrowing
of
the
statute
in
the
state
courts.
by
a
procedure
available
to
him
to
secure
such
a
narrowing
whether
he
can
it
be
then
and
only
then
repairs
to
united
states
district
court.
whether
the
united
states
district
court
then
if
it
fails
refuses
to
abstain
then
abuses
its
discretion
in
such
failure
to
abstain.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
sir?
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
your
honor,
the
record
is
in
two
parts
--
two
respects
between
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
i
see
what
you
mean
you
are.
in
the
first
place,
it
is
set
forth
in
the
complaint
filed
in
the
district
court.
and
the
record
at
page
2
and
particularly
in
paragraph
8
on
page
6.
the
prior
to
the
filing
of
a
proceeding
in
the
federal
court,
the
plaintiff
harris
appellee
here
had
filed
proceedings
in
all
of
the
state
courts
of
california
and
the
section
995
and
999
(a)
to
which
i
shall
refer
to
the
moment.
that's
paragraph
8,
page
6.
now,
in
addition
to
that
your
honor,
i
do
want
to
once
i
emphasize
--
i
suppose
when
it
shouldn't.
i
emphasize
two
matters
with
respect
to
the
record.
one
is
we
submitted
to
the
district
court
in
its
request
the
leaflets
which
are
the
subject
matter
of
the
indictment.
we
have
set
forth
these
leaflets
now
in
the
appendix
to
our
supplemental
brief
as
we
have
set
forth
the
entire
transcript
of
the
proceeding
and
before
the
grand
jury
namely
all
of
the
evidence
against
this
defendant
before
the
grand
jury.
now,
in
addition
to
that
your
honor
because
few
of
the
factors
is
one
of
a
number
of
cases
which
are
going
to
be
argued
before
your
honors
on
the
issue
of
abstention.
we
thought
this
court
ought
to
available
to
it,
all
of
the
proceedings
in
the
california
courts,
the
proceeding
before
the
superior
court
--
trial
court,
the
proceeding
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
the
supreme
court
of
california,
so
that
your
honors
will
see
that
we
raised
the
federal
constitutional
questions
as
well
as
state
constitutional
questions
but
because
my
client
is
not
well-heeled
and
was
permitted
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis.
we
didn't
have
the
funds,
we
didn't
print
the
entire
record
of
the
proceedings
in
the
california
court,
but
there
are
lodged
with
the
clerk
of
this
court
for
your
honors'
examination
and
should
you
be
so
advice.
however,
we
have
quote
from
that
record
which
is
in
the
possession
of
a
clerk,
portions
which
we
think
a
highly
relevant
and
we
printed
them
in
spite
of
lack
of
funds
in
this
appendix
with
you
your
honor.
now,
as
stated
by
the
attorney
general
plus
before
stated
by
the
attorney
general
in
his
brief
the
attorney
general
says
that
the
defendant
has
been
charged
with
acts
in
violation
of
the
california
criminal
syndicalism
law.
when
they
called
it
what
one
wants
but
the
act
with
which
he
is
charged
consists
solely
of
the
distribution
of
two
handbills
on
two
separate
days.
therefore,
he's
charged
with
two
violations
under
the
california
criminal
syndicalism
law.
a
violation
of
the
california
criminal
syndicalism
law
considered
was
considered
by
the
california
legislature
very
serious
when
this
statute
was
adopted
50
years
ago
so
that
he
faces
a
penitentiary
sentence
of
28
years,
14
years
for
each
pamphlet
distribution.
the
pamphlets
only
it
was
being
distributed
on
two
--
one
day
after
another.
moreover,
there
could
be
no
question
of
what
these
leaflets
considerably
highly
critical
of
the
los
angeles
police
were
distributed
at
a
proper
place
at
a
proper
time,
on
a
proper
occasion,
a
negro
had
been
shot
and
killed
by
white
officer.
he
grows
in
los
angeles
for
a
concern
about
the
matter,
an
inquest
was
being
held
as
to
the
cause
of
the
death
and
these
leaflets
conceivably
couched
in
very
strong
language
were
distributed
outside
of
the
inquest
hearing
on
the
steps
of
the
building
where
the
inquest
was
held.
now,
i
must
hasten
to
have
one
thing,
your
honors
or
to
try
to
clear
up
the
matter
about
which
there
could
be
some
misunderstanding.
the
leaflets
which
this
defendant
distributed
as
mr.
harris
stated
to
you
your
honors,
are
not
the
horrendously
leaflets
issued
by
the
american
nazi
party
which
are
attached
to
the
appellant's
opening
brief
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
defendant
which
three
leaflets
pertained
to
statements
made
by
organizations
with
which
the
defendant
has
no
relationship.
leaflets
which
were
never
introduced
before
the
grand
jury,
leaflets
which
couldn't
have
been
introduced
before
the
grand
jury
because
they
are
dated
two
years
after
the
indictment.
they
are
offered
to
your
honors
as
evidence
that
i
understand
or
i
assume
that
california
is
in
great
peril
from
organizations
that
want
to
destroy
it
and
therefore
this
indictment.
therefore,
these
leaflets
two
years
thereafter
are
relevant
to
the
indictment
of
the
defendant
two
years
before.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
oh!
well,
i
can
help.
that
i
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
as
a
matter
of
fact.
i
was
going
to
say
i
don't
mind
that
you're
reading
them
because
we
make
an
argument
about
those
leaflets
that
the
attorney
general
of
california
are
zealous
prosecutor
sees
dangers
to
california
which
no
one
else
sees
by
virtue
of
these
leaflets.
but
i
haven't
answered
your
honor's
question.
the
answer
is
that
it
is
a
blue
document
and
on
page
3
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
exactly
and
on
page
3,
--
pages
3,
4,
5,
6
contained
the
complete
text
of
the
indictment
against
them
and
the
complete
text
of
the
leaflets.
now,
you
will
notice
upon
reading
the
indictment,
there
is
no
reference
to
any
conduct
or
any
act
other
than
the
distribution
of
these
leaflets.
now,
i
have
set
your
honor
is
that
i'm
trying
to
emphasize
because
as
i
read
this
court's
decision.
the
distribution
of
leaflets
unaccompanied
by
acts
constitute
freedom
of
the
press
exercised
by
the
poor
man
and
i
don't
want
to
get
into
the
argument
whether
the
exercise
or
freedom
of
the
press
has
a
high
up
priority
than
other
rights
in
the
constitution
but
in
any
event
it
is
the
right
to
which
of
course
this
court
has
recognized
again
and
again
where
the
expression
of
opinion,
where
there
is
no
playing
by
the
prosecution
that
the
expression
of
opinion
is
accompanied
by
any
overt
act
(voice
overlap).
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
alright.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that
is
precisely
our
--
my
argument
which
i
hope
to
reach
now
in
just
about
a
minute
or
half
a
minute
some
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
better
not.
but
let
me
just
quickly
emphasize
at
this
point
that
the
criminal
syndicalism
act
upon
which
the
court
passed
and
which
may
be
found,
the
text
at
which
may
be
found
in
the
record
which
is
a
green
paper
at
pages
8
and
9.
it's
the
record
on
appeal.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
that's
what
i
mean
your
honor,
thank
you
for
helping
me
out.
if
your
honors
will
look
for
a
moment,
well
my
moments
to
me
are
precious.
at
the
text
of
the
criminal
syndicalism
act,
you
will
find
on
page
8
that
it
is
an
act
which
proscribes
doctrine
and
preset
so
it
is
an
act
aimed
at
the
expression
of
opinion.
and
as
mr.
harris
--
at
least
mr.
harris,
the
assistant
attorney
general
that
defendant
harris
was
charged
with
subsection
3.
if
your
honor
will
take
a
third
of
a
minute
to
look
at
that,
it's
on
page
9
you
will
find
that
that
makes
it
a
crime
to
print,
publish,
edit,
issue,
circulate
and
invite
and
teach
and
so
forth.
so
that
so
far
as
any
charge
against
this
defendant
is
concerned
or
so
far
as
any
charge
it's
possible
on
the
state,
purely
a
charged
involving
the
expression
of
opinion.
now,
i
better
get
to
the
heart
of
our
problem,
the
problem
of
abstention.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
now,
our
position
is
that
this
is
not
a
case
under
some
of
the
abstention
decisions
by
this
court
where
a
person
rushed
in
federal
court
is
not
a
case
where
he
sought
for
leaving
the
federal
court
prior
to
exhausting
available
remedies
to
him
to
secure
the
same
kind
of
relief
which
he
ultimately
secured
from
federal
court
from
the
state
courts.
and
that
leads
to
me
a
discussion
then
of
--
but
i
would
agree
with
justice
brennan's
heart
of
this
case
as
to
the
special
procedure
and
nature
of
special
procedure
in
california
to
do
that
because
if
california
has
a
special
procedure
whether
or
not
other
states
have
it
where
is
at
this
moment
of
no
concern
to
me.
though
i
suppose
of
course
it
is
a
concern
to
your
honors
but
i
think
in
other
case,
in
the
other
abstention
cases
following
this
one
rather
than
this
one
where
it
is
conceded
by
mr.
harris
there
is
a
procedure
in
california.
now,
of
course
we
don't
agree
entirely
as
to
the
scope
of
that
procedure.
we
have
reached
the
matter
and
by
way
of
counsel's
summary
this
is
the
thrust
of
our
brief
and
this
is
the
nature
of
our
position.
we
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
on
its
face
and
as
applied
in
the
trial
court
to
start
with
as
mr.
harris
conceded
under
california
procedure
in
contra
jurisdiction
to
procedure
in
the
federal
courts.
a
transcript
of
the
proceedings
before
the
grand
jury
is
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
and
a
copy
is
furnished
to
the
defendant.
and
he
may
challenge
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
as
well
as
the
constitutionality
of
any
prosecution
--
constitutionality
of
a
statute
upon
which
a
prosecution
is
based
in
a
proceeding
which
is
known
as
proceeding
under
penal
code
section
995.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
section
995.
it
is
referred
to
in
the
complaint.
it
is
discussed
more
or
less
extendedly
particularly
your
honor
in
our
reply
brief
which
is
a
manila
covered
document
at
pages
6,
7
and
8.
mr.
harris
said
to
you
your
honors
that
before
a
trial
in
california,
i
think
he
said,
may
they
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
by
habeas
corpus
or
by
prohibition
--
by
a
petition
by
the
prohibition.
a
petition
for
prohibition
was
filed
by
this
defendant.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that
goes
into
the
first
immediate
appellate
court
called
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no,
no.
that's
not
the
appellate
that
happens
to
superior
court
because
that
is
only
is
a
file
in
the
superior
court
then
it
goes
to
an
intermediate
appellate
court
known
as
court
of
appeals.
from
an
adverse
ruling
by
the
court
of
appeals,
one
goes
to
the
california
supreme
court
by
a
doctrine
known
as
a
petition
for
hearing.
in
which
petition
for
hearing
all
of
the
papers
which
are
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals
go
up
to
the
supreme
court
and
in
this
case
as
your
honors
will
see
if
you
will
examine
the
one
copy
of
the
proceedings
in
the
california
courts
on
file
at
the
clerk's
office,
all
of
the
proceedings
in
the
trial
court
are
annexed
to
the
proceeding
in
the
court
of
appeals
including
the
transcript
of
the
record
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
yes,
i
am.
three
or
four
minutes
i
think.
now,
it
is
our
view
and
we
discussed
it
your
honor
particularly
at
these
pages
which
are
referred
in
our
reply
brief
pages
6,
7
and
8
that
under
california
procedure.
the
california
statute
itself
and
the
california
courts
have
ruled
that
relief
must
be
accorded
to
a
defendant
where
the
evidence
is
insufficient
as
to
any
essential
element
of
the
offense.
this
case,
the
essential
element
of
the
offense
as
your
honors
decided
unanimously
just
his
last
term
in
brandenburg
versus
ohio
is
that
the
advocacy
must
be
accompanied
by
incitement
to
imminent
lawless
action
urged
upon
all
of
the
california
courts
was
that
there
was
no
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
as
there
is
no
charged
in
the
indictment
of
any
incitement
to
--
that
the
incitement
as
distinguished
from
advocacy
of
abstract
doctrine.
and
incidentally,
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
know
you'll
be
interested
to
know
that
the
district
court
was
greatly
persuaded
by
your
honor's
ruling
in
yates
and
in
mogul.
although,
maybe
this
record
i
just
made
is
irrelevant
to
my
--
to
the
point
i'm
making
but
the
distinction
between
abstract
advocacy
on
the
one
hand
and
incitement
imminent
lawless
action
on
the
other
which
distinction
is
not
drawn
by
the
statute
and
hence
it
is
overbroad
and
vague
under
decisions
of
this
court.
that
distinction
was
never
made,
that
distinction
was
never
recognized
by
any
in
california
court
in
claims
made
by
this
defendant
to
that
court,
and
therefore,
two
more
things
then
i'm
through
with
my
time.
therefore
we
do
not
agree
with
our
adversaries
that
the
california
criminal
syndicalism
act
an
act
aimed
at
preset
at
the
preachment
of
preset
and
doctrine
as
i've
indicated
have
ever
been
narrow
by
the
california
courts
to
comply
with
the
limitations
that
this
court
has
imposed
in
yates,
mogul
and
in
another
cases
and
particularly
in
brandenburg.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
alright,
let
me
address
myself
to
that
issue.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
i
would
agree
it's
the
whole
issue.
but
mr.
justice
harlan,
it
is
my
position
that
a
district
court
--
or
i
want
to
put
this
when
i
say
this
firmly
but
of
course
very
respectfully
does
not
barge
into
a
state
prosecution
when
there
is
a
state
procedure
which
authorizes
and
provides
for
relief
prior
to
trial
which
state
procedure
has
been
exhausted
by
a
defendant
in
every
california
court.
and
in
our
view,
it
is
no
disrespect
to
a
state
court,
it
is
no
frustration
of
the
authority
of
a
state
court
if
in
that
circumstance
when
a
state
court
has
been
given
every
opportunity
to
narrow
a
statute
and
has
not
been
so
for
a
defendant
to
then
repair
to
the
federal
courts
particularly
when
it
couldn't
come
to
this
court
because
that
situation
is
not
a
final
judgment
reviewable.
and
i
must
also
confess
your
honor
that
i
do
draw
a
distinction
between
a
free
speech
case
and
another
case.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i'm
not
suggesting
that
at
all.
i'm
merely
suggesting
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
agree
entirely
with
that
your
honor
has
said
with
of
course
a
qualification
and
my
qualification
is,
that
so
far
as
a
doctrine
of
abstention
is
concerned
a
doctrine
which
is
positive
on
the
constitutional
principle
that
the
federal
court
should
not
frustrate
the
actions
of
state
court
except
where
appropriate
that
if
there
is
a
special
procedure
in
the
state
court
and
it
is
followed
by
a
defendant
that
it's
timely
for
him
to
repair
to
the
district
court
and
secure
redress
in
the
district
court
with
respect
to
matters
which
are
--
with
respect
to
which
he
has
not
secure
of
redress
in
these
proceedings
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
now,
i
will
come
to
2283
and
there
are
two
things
to
be
said
about
2283
in
connection
with
this
case.
first,
2283
was
never
raised
by
the
district
attorney
in
the
trial
court.
i
don't
know
how
important
that
is.
it
may
be
after
i
explain
in
the
moment.
in
the
notice
of
appeal
to
this
court
2283
was
not
mentioned.
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
to
this
court
2283
was
not
relied
upon.
although,
shortly
thereafter
the
attorney
general
filed
a
memorandum
in
support
to
jurisdictional
statement
raising
for
the
first
time
section
2283.
of
course,
if
section
2283
is
a
jurisdictional
statute
and
i
don't
understand
that's
the
position
of
mr.
harris,
it
can
be
raised
here
whether
or
not
raised
below.
but
i
make
some
point
of
a
fact
that
it
wasn't
raised
below
for
this
reason.
the
district
court
essentially
made
a
declaration
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
then,
if
i
may
say
so,
to
help
the
district
attorney
it
went
on
and
issued
a
preliminary
injunction
sua
sponte
not
on
request
of
the
plaintiffs
because
all
was
pending
before
the
district
court
was
a
motion
to
dismiss
by
the
appellant.
it
issued
the
preliminary
injunction
in
new
order
to
give
the
district
attorney
an
opportunity
to
appeal
to
this
court
and
secure
a
review.
and
had
section
2283
didn't
raise
in
the
court
below
very
possible,
the
court
below
might
have
decided
not
to
issue
any
injunction
for
if
declaration
for
statute
was
unconstitutional
it
would
probably
be
insufficient.
now,
that's
part
of
the
argument
but
not
the
main
part.
now
section
2283
contains
three
subdivisions
each
of
which
in
our
view
was
complied
with
in
this
case.
one
of
the
subdivisions
of
section
2283,
one
of
the
exceptions
of
section
2283
is
where
an
order
of
a
district
court
is
an
aid
of
its
jurisdiction
or
in
aid
of
its
judgment.
at
the
time
this
matter
was
heard
by
three-judge
district
court,
no
response
of
pleading
had
been
filed
by
the
appellant.
all
it
was
before
the
court
was
a
motion
to
dismiss
which
motion
to
dismiss,
the
district
court
rejected.
it
had
jurisdiction
over
the
cause
so
mr.
harris
concedes
and
therefore
to
preserve
its
jurisdiction
and
its
authority.
ultimately,
later
to
enter
to
a
judgment
a
declaratory
judgment
under
zwickler
versus
koota
which
doesn't
involve
the
injunction
of
statute
at
all
and
which
was
the
--
the
only
matter
which
the
district
court
really
decided
in
zwickler
versus
koota,
your
honors
with
unanimous
although
that
it
is
special
and
interesting,
and
exciting
concurring
opinion
by
justice
harlan.
so,
what
the
court
did
therefore
was
to
issue
an
injunction
to
sustain
its
jurisdiction
in
order
to
be
able
to
effectuate
its
ultimate
judgment
which
ultimate
judgment
could
have
been
and
might
have
been
only
a
declaratory
judgment
which
is
as
we
say
under
zwickler
versus
koota,
it
could
have
done.
and
finally
of
course,
your
honors
we
make
the
argument
though
it's
–
thought
this
court
has
never
yet
decided
the
matter
that
the
civil
rights
act
under
which
this
suit
was
filed
in
the
district
court
which
authorizes
the
district
court
to
grant
relief
by
way
of
damages
and
injunction,
is
one
of
the
exceptions
to
the
injunction
statute
and
that
the
district
court
below
therefore
was
merely
complying
with
the
authority
which
the
congress
had
conferred
upon
it
in
the
civil
rights
act
in
issuing
the
injunction
in
this
case.
again
and
this
also
dealt
an
injunction
not
necessary
in
this
case,
not
issue
at
the
request
of
the
plaintiffs
but
is
there
to
help
the
district
attorney
and
to
help
mr.
harris.
now,
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
your
honor
it
turns
out
that
fours
years
is
when
it
get
too
long
maybe
that
isn't
important.
also
part
of
the
time
your
honor
is
attributable
to
this
court
because
you
heard
this
case
before
and
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
and
we
say
that
there
are
three
exceptions
in
2283
and
that
in
this
instance
and
these
are
either
in
the
injunctive,
these
exceptions
anyone
with
it
and
that
in
this
case
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
i
think
he
wants
as
he
--
it
was
a
three-judge
court,
that's
right.
in
any
event,
to
maintain
the
status
quo
more
than
not
to
have
its
jurisdiction
moot,
we
think
it
was
proper
to
issue
some
kind
of
injunctive
relief
for
that
purpose.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
what
the
district
court
did
in
effect
was
to
issue
a
declaratory
judgment
but
not
a
final
declaratory
judgment
because
he's
not
right.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
an
appeal
to
this
court.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
and
appeal
to
this
court.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
the
district
court
could.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
not
very
much
except
we
think
that
the
three-judge
district
court
had
the
impressions
of
anticipating
the
ruling
of
this
court
in
brandenburg.
we
would
like
to
see
a
judgment
reversed.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
ultimate
question
as
we
view
it
is
whether
or
not
the
california
criminal
syndicalism
act
is
unconstitutional
in
violating
the
first
amendment
and
whether
the
district
court
in
so
ruling
was
correct.
but
long
before
that
ultimate
question
is
reached
there
is
concededly
a
serious
threshold
question
and
we
the
appellees
or
particularly
appellee
harris
has
to
succeed
in
crossing
that
threshold
in
order
to
prevail.
the
threshold
question
is
whether
or
not
where
there
is
a
special
procedure
in
a
state
for
the
raising
of
federal
as
well
as
state
constitutional
questions
prior
to
trial
as
there
is
in
state
of
california
and
as
frankly
and
candidly
fairly
stated
by
mr.
harris.
where
there
is
a
special
procedure
for
raising
both
the
constitutionality
of
statute
on
its
face
and
as
applied
and
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
adduce
before
the
grand
jury
in
connection
with
such
statute
and
where
a
defendant
charged
with
an
offense
has
exhausted
every
available
--
first,
where
there's
a
procedure
available
to
him
and
where
he
has
taken
every
step
under
that
procedure
and
having
failed
in
these
steps
to
secure
a
narrowing
of
the
statute
or
a
dismissal
of
the
cases
filing
the
first
amendment
whether
or
not
if
and
in
the
case
involving
only
the
expression
of
opinion,
only
speech
--
pure
speech
unaccompanied
by
plus
or
conduct
or
acts
or
anything
other
than
the
expression
of
opinion.
and
question
is
therefore,
when
a
defendant
in
that
circumstance
under
that
kind
of
a
procedure
in
a
state
court
after
having
failed
to
secure
narrowing
of
the
statute
in
the
state
courts.
by
a
procedure
available
to
him
to
secure
such
a
narrowing
whether
he
can
it
be
then
and
only
then
repairs
to
united
states
district
court.
whether
the
united
states
district
court
then
if
it
fails
refuses
to
abstain
then
abuses
its
discretion
in
such
failure
to
abstain.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
sir?
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
your
honor,
the
record
is
in
two
parts
--
two
respects
between
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
i
see
what
you
mean
you
are.
in
the
first
place,
it
is
set
forth
in
the
complaint
filed
in
the
district
court.
and
the
record
at
page
2
and
particularly
in
paragraph
8
on
page
6.
the
prior
to
the
filing
of
a
proceeding
in
the
federal
court,
the
plaintiff
harris
appellee
here
had
filed
proceedings
in
all
of
the
state
courts
of
california
and
the
section
995
and
999
(a)
to
which
i
shall
refer
to
the
moment.
that's
paragraph
8,
page
6.
now,
in
addition
to
that
your
honor,
i
do
want
to
once
i
emphasize
--
i
suppose
when
it
shouldn't.
i
emphasize
two
matters
with
respect
to
the
record.
one
is
we
submitted
to
the
district
court
in
its
request
the
leaflets
which
are
the
subject
matter
of
the
indictment.
we
have
set
forth
these
leaflets
now
in
the
appendix
to
our
supplemental
brief
as
we
have
set
forth
the
entire
transcript
of
the
proceeding
and
before
the
grand
jury
namely
all
of
the
evidence
against
this
defendant
before
the
grand
jury.
now,
in
addition
to
that
your
honor
because
few
of
the
factors
is
one
of
a
number
of
cases
which
are
going
to
be
argued
before
your
honors
on
the
issue
of
abstention.
we
thought
this
court
ought
to
available
to
it,
all
of
the
proceedings
in
the
california
courts,
the
proceeding
before
the
superior
court
--
trial
court,
the
proceeding
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
the
supreme
court
of
california,
so
that
your
honors
will
see
that
we
raised
the
federal
constitutional
questions
as
well
as
state
constitutional
questions
but
because
my
client
is
not
well-heeled
and
was
permitted
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis.
we
didn't
have
the
funds,
we
didn't
print
the
entire
record
of
the
proceedings
in
the
california
court,
but
there
are
lodged
with
the
clerk
of
this
court
for
your
honors'
examination
and
should
you
be
so
advice.
however,
we
have
quote
from
that
record
which
is
in
the
possession
of
a
clerk,
portions
which
we
think
a
highly
relevant
and
we
printed
them
in
spite
of
lack
of
funds
in
this
appendix
with
you
your
honor.
now,
as
stated
by
the
attorney
general
plus
before
stated
by
the
attorney
general
in
his
brief
the
attorney
general
says
that
the
defendant
has
been
charged
with
acts
in
violation
of
the
california
criminal
syndicalism
law.
when
they
called
it
what
one
wants
but
the
act
with
which
he
is
charged
consists
solely
of
the
distribution
of
two
handbills
on
two
separate
days.
therefore,
he's
charged
with
two
violations
under
the
california
criminal
syndicalism
law.
a
violation
of
the
california
criminal
syndicalism
law
considered
was
considered
by
the
california
legislature
very
serious
when
this
statute
was
adopted
50
years
ago
so
that
he
faces
a
penitentiary
sentence
of
28
years,
14
years
for
each
pamphlet
distribution.
the
pamphlets
only
it
was
being
distributed
on
two
--
one
day
after
another.
moreover,
there
could
be
no
question
of
what
these
leaflets
considerably
highly
critical
of
the
los
angeles
police
were
distributed
at
a
proper
place
at
a
proper
time,
on
a
proper
occasion,
a
negro
had
been
shot
and
killed
by
white
officer.
he
grows
in
los
angeles
for
a
concern
about
the
matter,
an
inquest
was
being
held
as
to
the
cause
of
the
death
and
these
leaflets
conceivably
couched
in
very
strong
language
were
distributed
outside
of
the
inquest
hearing
on
the
steps
of
the
building
where
the
inquest
was
held.
now,
i
must
hasten
to
have
one
thing,
your
honors
or
to
try
to
clear
up
the
matter
about
which
there
could
be
some
misunderstanding.
the
leaflets
which
this
defendant
distributed
as
mr.
harris
stated
to
you
your
honors,
are
not
the
horrendously
leaflets
issued
by
the
american
nazi
party
which
are
attached
to
the
appellant's
opening
brief
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
defendant
which
three
leaflets
pertained
to
statements
made
by
organizations
with
which
the
defendant
has
no
relationship.
leaflets
which
were
never
introduced
before
the
grand
jury,
leaflets
which
couldn't
have
been
introduced
before
the
grand
jury
because
they
are
dated
two
years
after
the
indictment.
they
are
offered
to
your
honors
as
evidence
that
i
understand
or
i
assume
that
california
is
in
great
peril
from
organizations
that
want
to
destroy
it
and
therefore
this
indictment.
therefore,
these
leaflets
two
years
thereafter
are
relevant
to
the
indictment
of
the
defendant
two
years
before.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
oh!
well,
i
can
help.
that
i
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
as
a
matter
of
fact.
i
was
going
to
say
i
don't
mind
that
you're
reading
them
because
we
make
an
argument
about
those
leaflets
that
the
attorney
general
of
california
are
zealous
prosecutor
sees
dangers
to
california
which
no
one
else
sees
by
virtue
of
these
leaflets.
but
i
haven't
answered
your
honor's
question.
the
answer
is
that
it
is
a
blue
document
and
on
page
3
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
exactly
and
on
page
3,
--
pages
3,
4,
5,
6
contained
the
complete
text
of
the
indictment
against
them
and
the
complete
text
of
the
leaflets.
now,
you
will
notice
upon
reading
the
indictment,
there
is
no
reference
to
any
conduct
or
any
act
other
than
the
distribution
of
these
leaflets.
now,
i
have
set
your
honor
is
that
i'm
trying
to
emphasize
because
as
i
read
this
court's
decision.
the
distribution
of
leaflets
unaccompanied
by
acts
constitute
freedom
of
the
press
exercised
by
the
poor
man
and
i
don't
want
to
get
into
the
argument
whether
the
exercise
or
freedom
of
the
press
has
a
high
up
priority
than
other
rights
in
the
constitution
but
in
any
event
it
is
the
right
to
which
of
course
this
court
has
recognized
again
and
again
where
the
expression
of
opinion,
where
there
is
no
playing
by
the
prosecution
that
the
expression
of
opinion
is
accompanied
by
any
overt
act
(voice
overlap).
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
alright.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that
is
precisely
our
--
my
argument
which
i
hope
to
reach
now
in
just
about
a
minute
or
half
a
minute
some
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
better
not.
but
let
me
just
quickly
emphasize
at
this
point
that
the
criminal
syndicalism
act
upon
which
the
court
passed
and
which
may
be
found,
the
text
at
which
may
be
found
in
the
record
which
is
a
green
paper
at
pages
8
and
9.
it's
the
record
on
appeal.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
that's
what
i
mean
your
honor,
thank
you
for
helping
me
out.
if
your
honors
will
look
for
a
moment,
well
my
moments
to
me
are
precious.
at
the
text
of
the
criminal
syndicalism
act,
you
will
find
on
page
8
that
it
is
an
act
which
proscribes
doctrine
and
preset
so
it
is
an
act
aimed
at
the
expression
of
opinion.
and
as
mr.
harris
--
at
least
mr.
harris,
the
assistant
attorney
general
that
defendant
harris
was
charged
with
subsection
3.
if
your
honor
will
take
a
third
of
a
minute
to
look
at
that,
it's
on
page
9
you
will
find
that
that
makes
it
a
crime
to
print,
publish,
edit,
issue,
circulate
and
invite
and
teach
and
so
forth.
so
that
so
far
as
any
charge
against
this
defendant
is
concerned
or
so
far
as
any
charge
it's
possible
on
the
state,
purely
a
charged
involving
the
expression
of
opinion.
now,
i
better
get
to
the
heart
of
our
problem,
the
problem
of
abstention.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
now,
our
position
is
that
this
is
not
a
case
under
some
of
the
abstention
decisions
by
this
court
where
a
person
rushed
in
federal
court
is
not
a
case
where
he
sought
for
leaving
the
federal
court
prior
to
exhausting
available
remedies
to
him
to
secure
the
same
kind
of
relief
which
he
ultimately
secured
from
federal
court
from
the
state
courts.
and
that
leads
to
me
a
discussion
then
of
--
but
i
would
agree
with
justice
brennan's
heart
of
this
case
as
to
the
special
procedure
and
nature
of
special
procedure
in
california
to
do
that
because
if
california
has
a
special
procedure
whether
or
not
other
states
have
it
where
is
at
this
moment
of
no
concern
to
me.
though
i
suppose
of
course
it
is
a
concern
to
your
honors
but
i
think
in
other
case,
in
the
other
abstention
cases
following
this
one
rather
than
this
one
where
it
is
conceded
by
mr.
harris
there
is
a
procedure
in
california.
now,
of
course
we
don't
agree
entirely
as
to
the
scope
of
that
procedure.
we
have
reached
the
matter
and
by
way
of
counsel's
summary
this
is
the
thrust
of
our
brief
and
this
is
the
nature
of
our
position.
we
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
on
its
face
and
as
applied
in
the
trial
court
to
start
with
as
mr.
harris
conceded
under
california
procedure
in
contra
jurisdiction
to
procedure
in
the
federal
courts.
a
transcript
of
the
proceedings
before
the
grand
jury
is
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
and
a
copy
is
furnished
to
the
defendant.
and
he
may
challenge
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
as
well
as
the
constitutionality
of
any
prosecution
--
constitutionality
of
a
statute
upon
which
a
prosecution
is
based
in
a
proceeding
which
is
known
as
proceeding
under
penal
code
section
995.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
section
995.
it
is
referred
to
in
the
complaint.
it
is
discussed
more
or
less
extendedly
particularly
your
honor
in
our
reply
brief
which
is
a
manila
covered
document
at
pages
6,
7
and
8.
mr.
harris
said
to
you
your
honors
that
before
a
trial
in
california,
i
think
he
said,
may
they
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
by
habeas
corpus
or
by
prohibition
--
by
a
petition
by
the
prohibition.
a
petition
for
prohibition
was
filed
by
this
defendant.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that
goes
into
the
first
immediate
appellate
court
called
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no,
no.
that's
not
the
appellate
that
happens
to
superior
court
because
that
is
only
is
a
file
in
the
superior
court
then
it
goes
to
an
intermediate
appellate
court
known
as
court
of
appeals.
from
an
adverse
ruling
by
the
court
of
appeals,
one
goes
to
the
california
supreme
court
by
a
doctrine
known
as
a
petition
for
hearing.
in
which
petition
for
hearing
all
of
the
papers
which
are
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals
go
up
to
the
supreme
court
and
in
this
case
as
your
honors
will
see
if
you
will
examine
the
one
copy
of
the
proceedings
in
the
california
courts
on
file
at
the
clerk's
office,
all
of
the
proceedings
in
the
trial
court
are
annexed
to
the
proceeding
in
the
court
of
appeals
including
the
transcript
of
the
record
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
yes,
i
am.
three
or
four
minutes
i
think.
now,
it
is
our
view
and
we
discussed
it
your
honor
particularly
at
these
pages
which
are
referred
in
our
reply
brief
pages
6,
7
and
8
that
under
california
procedure.
the
california
statute
itself
and
the
california
courts
have
ruled
that
relief
must
be
accorded
to
a
defendant
where
the
evidence
is
insufficient
as
to
any
essential
element
of
the
offense.
this
case,
the
essential
element
of
the
offense
as
your
honors
decided
unanimously
just
his
last
term
in
brandenburg
versus
ohio
is
that
the
advocacy
must
be
accompanied
by
incitement
to
imminent
lawless
action
urged
upon
all
of
the
california
courts
was
that
there
was
no
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
as
there
is
no
charged
in
the
indictment
of
any
incitement
to
--
that
the
incitement
as
distinguished
from
advocacy
of
abstract
doctrine.
and
incidentally,
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
know
you'll
be
interested
to
know
that
the
district
court
was
greatly
persuaded
by
your
honor's
ruling
in
yates
and
in
mogul.
although,
maybe
this
record
i
just
made
is
irrelevant
to
my
--
to
the
point
i'm
making
but
the
distinction
between
abstract
advocacy
on
the
one
hand
and
incitement
imminent
lawless
action
on
the
other
which
distinction
is
not
drawn
by
the
statute
and
hence
it
is
overbroad
and
vague
under
decisions
of
this
court.
that
distinction
was
never
made,
that
distinction
was
never
recognized
by
any
in
california
court
in
claims
made
by
this
defendant
to
that
court,
and
therefore,
two
more
things
then
i'm
through
with
my
time.
therefore
we
do
not
agree
with
our
adversaries
that
the
california
criminal
syndicalism
act
an
act
aimed
at
preset
at
the
preachment
of
preset
and
doctrine
as
i've
indicated
have
ever
been
narrow
by
the
california
courts
to
comply
with
the
limitations
that
this
court
has
imposed
in
yates,
mogul
and
in
another
cases
and
particularly
in
brandenburg.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
alright,
let
me
address
myself
to
that
issue.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
i
would
agree
it's
the
whole
issue.
but
mr.
justice
harlan,
it
is
my
position
that
a
district
court
--
or
i
want
to
put
this
when
i
say
this
firmly
but
of
course
very
respectfully
does
not
barge
into
a
state
prosecution
when
there
is
a
state
procedure
which
authorizes
and
provides
for
relief
prior
to
trial
which
state
procedure
has
been
exhausted
by
a
defendant
in
every
california
court.
and
in
our
view,
it
is
no
disrespect
to
a
state
court,
it
is
no
frustration
of
the
authority
of
a
state
court
if
in
that
circumstance
when
a
state
court
has
been
given
every
opportunity
to
narrow
a
statute
and
has
not
been
so
for
a
defendant
to
then
repair
to
the
federal
courts
particularly
when
it
couldn't
come
to
this
court
because
that
situation
is
not
a
final
judgment
reviewable.
and
i
must
also
confess
your
honor
that
i
do
draw
a
distinction
between
a
free
speech
case
and
another
case.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i'm
not
suggesting
that
at
all.
i'm
merely
suggesting
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
agree
entirely
with
that
your
honor
has
said
with
of
course
a
qualification
and
my
qualification
is,
that
so
far
as
a
doctrine
of
abstention
is
concerned
a
doctrine
which
is
positive
on
the
constitutional
principle
that
the
federal
court
should
not
frustrate
the
actions
of
state
court
except
where
appropriate
that
if
there
is
a
special
procedure
in
the
state
court
and
it
is
followed
by
a
defendant
that
it's
timely
for
him
to
repair
to
the
district
court
and
secure
redress
in
the
district
court
with
respect
to
matters
which
are
--
with
respect
to
which
he
has
not
secure
of
redress
in
these
proceedings
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
now,
i
will
come
to
2283
and
there
are
two
things
to
be
said
about
2283
in
connection
with
this
case.
first,
2283
was
never
raised
by
the
district
attorney
in
the
trial
court.
i
don't
know
how
important
that
is.
it
may
be
after
i
explain
in
the
moment.
in
the
notice
of
appeal
to
this
court
2283
was
not
mentioned.
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
to
this
court
2283
was
not
relied
upon.
although,
shortly
thereafter
the
attorney
general
filed
a
memorandum
in
support
to
jurisdictional
statement
raising
for
the
first
time
section
2283.
of
course,
if
section
2283
is
a
jurisdictional
statute
and
i
don't
understand
that's
the
position
of
mr.
harris,
it
can
be
raised
here
whether
or
not
raised
below.
but
i
make
some
point
of
a
fact
that
it
wasn't
raised
below
for
this
reason.
the
district
court
essentially
made
a
declaration
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
then,
if
i
may
say
so,
to
help
the
district
attorney
it
went
on
and
issued
a
preliminary
injunction
sua
sponte
not
on
request
of
the
plaintiffs
because
all
was
pending
before
the
district
court
was
a
motion
to
dismiss
by
the
appellant.
it
issued
the
preliminary
injunction
in
new
order
to
give
the
district
attorney
an
opportunity
to
appeal
to
this
court
and
secure
a
review.
and
had
section
2283
didn't
raise
in
the
court
below
very
possible,
the
court
below
might
have
decided
not
to
issue
any
injunction
for
if
declaration
for
statute
was
unconstitutional
it
would
probably
be
insufficient.
now,
that's
part
of
the
argument
but
not
the
main
part.
now
section
2283
contains
three
subdivisions
each
of
which
in
our
view
was
complied
with
in
this
case.
one
of
the
subdivisions
of
section
2283,
one
of
the
exceptions
of
section
2283
is
where
an
order
of
a
district
court
is
an
aid
of
its
jurisdiction
or
in
aid
of
its
judgment.
at
the
time
this
matter
was
heard
by
three-judge
district
court,
no
response
of
pleading
had
been
filed
by
the
appellant.
all
it
was
before
the
court
was
a
motion
to
dismiss
which
motion
to
dismiss,
the
district
court
rejected.
it
had
jurisdiction
over
the
cause
so
mr.
harris
concedes
and
therefore
to
preserve
its
jurisdiction
and
its
authority.
ultimately,
later
to
enter
to
a
judgment
a
declaratory
judgment
under
zwickler
versus
koota
which
doesn't
involve
the
injunction
of
statute
at
all
and
which
was
the
--
the
only
matter
which
the
district
court
really
decided
in
zwickler
versus
koota,
your
honors
with
unanimous
although
that
it
is
special
and
interesting,
and
exciting
concurring
opinion
by
justice
harlan.
so,
what
the
court
did
therefore
was
to
issue
an
injunction
to
sustain
its
jurisdiction
in
order
to
be
able
to
effectuate
its
ultimate
judgment
which
ultimate
judgment
could
have
been
and
might
have
been
only
a
declaratory
judgment
which
is
as
we
say
under
zwickler
versus
koota,
it
could
have
done.
and
finally
of
course,
your
honors
we
make
the
argument
though
it's
–
thought
this
court
has
never
yet
decided
the
matter
that
the
civil
rights
act
under
which
this
suit
was
filed
in
the
district
court
which
authorizes
the
district
court
to
grant
relief
by
way
of
damages
and
injunction,
is
one
of
the
exceptions
to
the
injunction
statute
and
that
the
district
court
below
therefore
was
merely
complying
with
the
authority
which
the
congress
had
conferred
upon
it
in
the
civil
rights
act
in
issuing
the
injunction
in
this
case.
again
and
this
also
dealt
an
injunction
not
necessary
in
this
case,
not
issue
at
the
request
of
the
plaintiffs
but
is
there
to
help
the
district
attorney
and
to
help
mr.
harris.
now,
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
your
honor
it
turns
out
that
fours
years
is
when
it
get
too
long
maybe
that
isn't
important.
also
part
of
the
time
your
honor
is
attributable
to
this
court
because
you
heard
this
case
before
and
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
and
we
say
that
there
are
three
exceptions
in
2283
and
that
in
this
instance
and
these
are
either
in
the
injunctive,
these
exceptions
anyone
with
it
and
that
in
this
case
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
i
think
he
wants
as
he
--
it
was
a
three-judge
court,
that's
right.
in
any
event,
to
maintain
the
status
quo
more
than
not
to
have
its
jurisdiction
moot,
we
think
it
was
proper
to
issue
some
kind
of
injunctive
relief
for
that
purpose.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
what
the
district
court
did
in
effect
was
to
issue
a
declaratory
judgment
but
not
a
final
declaratory
judgment
because
he's
not
right.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
an
appeal
to
this
court.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
and
appeal
to
this
court.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
the
district
court
could.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
not
very
much
except
we
think
that
the
three-judge
district
court
had
the
impressions
of
anticipating
the
ruling
of
this
court
in
brandenburg.
we
would
like
to
see
a
judgment
reversed.
