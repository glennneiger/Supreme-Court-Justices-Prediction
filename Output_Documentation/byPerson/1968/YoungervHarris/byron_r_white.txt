justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
was
not
a
prosecution
pending
when
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
there
is
one
here
and
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
has
a
comity
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
--
for
the
state
rather
than
there's
a
matter
of
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
don't
you
think
it's
significant
here
though
that
the
matter
that
the
--
while
the
normal
case
that
might
be
some
force
just
to
in
their
two
proceedings
going
the
same
time
involving
the
same
questions
that
maybe
the
federal
court
although
wait
until
the
state
gets
done
but
in
this
case
the
states
already
rejected
this
constitutional
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it's
already
been
presented
in
the
state
courts,
it's
been
rejected.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
not
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
that
the
trial
courts
are
already
rejected
in
any
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
many
statutes
were
brought
in
the
lower
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
--
i
take
that
you
argue
that
none
of
the
other
sections
should
be
reached
by
any
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
below
defined
the
law
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
patently
invalid
on
its
face
covers
a
lot
of
ground,
doesn't
it?
and
i
suppose
that's
one
of
your
major
arguments
in
this
case
that
it
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
you
also
argue
that
even
if
the
statute
should
be
read
as
having
been
narrowed
by
some
past
decisions
or
even
it
--
or
even
if
we
should
assume
that
the
california
courts
would
narrow
it
to
some
extent,
do
you
contend
that
in
this
narrowed
form
that
the
state
was
to
present
it
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
even
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
even
in
the
trial
court
it
was
just
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
what
form?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
did
he
understand
the
statute
to
mean
what
you
say
it
means
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--or
did
he
assume
that
the
statute
should
be
considered
in
there
over
forum?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
really
need
the
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
do
you
really
need
to
--
need
in
the
lower
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
district
court
said
anything
at
all
on
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
can't
it
say
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
harris,
have
you
got
any
examples
of
federal
court
in
a
declaratory
judgment
action
like
this
attacking
a
state
statute
of
declaring
the
statute
to
be
unconstitutional
insofar
as
it
reaches
some
things
that
it
shouldn't
reach
but
leaving
it
but
saying
it
is
constitutional
in
other
respects.
for
example,
if
the
claim
is
that
this
statute
is
overbroad
and
reaches
some
kinds
of
teaching
that
it
shouldn't
which
i
gather
is
essentially
the
claims,
isn't
it?
and
the
federal
statute,
can
the
federal
court
say,
yes,
we
agree
that
the
federal
statute
is
--
that
the
state
statute
is
unconstitutionally
overbroad
and
insofar
as
that
reaches
these
forbidden
areas
that
it
is
unconstitutional
and
stop
vague.
normally,
i
--
as
i
understand
it
to
the
federal
court
has
said
that
it
finds
it
overbroad
if
it
strikes
down
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
see
any
barrier
or
you're
just
saying
it's
over
--
it's
unconstitutional
and
so
far
as
it's
overbroad
which
would
leave
the
state
in
the
position
that
you
suggest
that
was
enforcing
the
statute
within
the
narrow
valid
area?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can't
get
on
its
face,
it
says
that
it
reaches
and
that
it
reaches
some
kinds
of
teaching
that
it
shouldn't
reach,
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
it's
a
vagueness
thing
i
think
i
can
understand
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
should
act
like
a
state
court
and
say
this
is
what
the
statute
means?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
perhaps
it
was
made
against
broslawsky?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
suppose
you're
right
because
whether
or
not
that's
constitutional.
the
real
issue
here
is
whether
you
want
that
--
like
that
out
the
state
courts
and
not
the
federal
court
at
