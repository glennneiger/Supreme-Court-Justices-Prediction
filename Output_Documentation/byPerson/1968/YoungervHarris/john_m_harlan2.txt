mr.
harris,
what
was
the
day,
they
asked?
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
an
injunction
actually
issue
against
the
state
prosecutor
passed?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
could
have
exists
in
all
the
way
through?
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
you
going
to
deal
at
some
point
with
the
impact
of
995
on
2283?
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
we
called
in
this
case
to
review
the
proceeding
to
spend
so

time

for
arguing
into
the
state

at
the
stage
based
on
2283
and
in
the
face
of
a
situation
charged
now
with
harassment
in
this
man
by
becoming
that
as
the
narrow
issue.
