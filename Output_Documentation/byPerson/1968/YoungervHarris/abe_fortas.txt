justice
abe
fortas
which
case
is
that
i'm
sorry?
justice
abe
fortas
what's
your
--
how
do
you
make
that?
do
you
say
that
that
is
advocating
extermination
of
the
police?
justice
abe
fortas
and
do
you
say
that
he
was
calling
on
people
to
go
ahead
and
immediately
to
rise
and
to
attack
the
police?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what's
your
constitutional
theory?
justice
abe
fortas
why
is
that?
justice
abe
fortas
why
is
that,
you
simply
are
certain
of
the
language
of
the
statute
that
is
broad
enough
to
convict
him
just
for
advocacy
or
even
for
approval
of
it
--
just
for
approval
of
it,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
by
the
way,
when
is
the
last
term
before
this
indictment
was
laid
under
the
statute
in
california?
justice
abe
fortas
statute
was
enacted
in
1919?
justice
abe
fortas
and
there
were
a
lot
of
prosecutions
then
and
then
there
was
more
prosecutions
in
the
30's?
justice
abe
fortas
and
now,
the
statute
is
a
statute
being
used
widely
in
california,
do
you
know
or
not?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
let
me
see
--
justice
abe
fortas
let
me
see
if
i
understand
your
position.
you
are
defending
this
statute
on
the
grounds
that
it
strikes
at
the
advocacy
of
violence,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you're
not
trying
this
defendant
on
the
words
that
are
in
the
statute
by
aiding
and
abetting?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
defend
the
statute,
does
it
written
and
you
got
--
you
got
some
other
problems.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
not
my
question
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
my
question
is
whether
you
are
defending
the
statute
in
this
litigation
on
the
basis
of
the
following
language
which
appears
in
section
11400.
it
says,
criminal
syndicalism
means,
i'll
interpolate
not
only
any
doctrine
or
precept
to
advocating
teaching
or
aiding
advocating
or
teaching
whether
it
also
any
doctrine
aiding
and
abetting
the
commission
of
crime
or
sabotage?
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
whether
your
submission
to
us
depends
--
relies
to
any
material
extended
upon
the
use
in
this
statute
of
the
phrase
commission
of
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
11400.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
commission
as
distinguished
possibly
arguably
as
distinguish
to
advocacy.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
trying
to
suggest
an
argument
to
you.
i'm
just
trying
to
clarify
of
what
your
position
is.
justice
abe
fortas
so,
you're
defending
this
on
planning
basis
of
statute
that
makes
it
a
crime
to
teach
or
advocate
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
they
described
back?
justice
abe
fortas
right.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
your
position
then
--
your
position
is
that
the
requirements
of
dombrowski
and
zwickler
are
satisfied
if
somebody
merely
alleges
and
proves
let
us
say
that
he
is
engaging
in
some
form
of
expression
that
a
statute
prohibits
on
its
face,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
that
you
don't
need
any
overt
acts
by
the
state.
in
dombrowski
there
were
over
acts,
in
zwickler
there
were
overt
acts
by
the
state.
but
it's
your
submission
now
that
such
overt
acts
are
not
necessary
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
provided
only
that
a
person
in
this
case
is
engaged
in
the
kind
of
teaching
or
advocacy
that
statute
on
its
face
prohibits
but
when
--
do
you
think
that
is
the
narrow
holding
that
that
is
a
holding
of
dombrowski
and
in
zwickler?
justice
abe
fortas
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
just
--
i
want
ask
you
this
one
question;
in
dombrowski
and
in
zwickler
the
state
had
taken
certain
types
of
action
short
of
indictment
in
both
case
or
in
dombrowski
in
a
way.
but
the
state
had
taken
certain
types
of
action
that
made
a
record
of
harassment
or
interference
with
or
abstraction
to
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights,
do
you
agree
that
that
is
the
reading
of
those
cases?
justice
abe
fortas
and
here
with
respect
to
these
three
persons
other
than
mr.
harris
you
have
nothing
of
that
sort?
justice
abe
fortas
what
are
the
overt
acts?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
danskin
--
justice
abe
fortas
danskin
is
quite
another
matter
isn't
it
and
that
case
judge
treanor
was
trying
to
get
out
of
the
box
that
he
was
in
because
of
whitney
and
this
discussion
of
the
criminal
syndicalism
statute
was
dictum
and
it
was
made
necessary
by
the
fact
that
the
statute
they
had
before
them
was
considering
to
be
an
addition
to
the
criminal
syndicalism
statute.
and
that
addition
was
held
to
be
unconstitutional
as
directed
to
pure
speech.
and
in
order
to
distinguish
the
whitney
and
the
criminal
syndicalism
statute,
judge
treanor
says
that
the
criminal
syndicalism
act
can
be
applied
only
when
there
is
eminent
danger
that
the
advocacy
it
seeks
to
prohibit
will
give
rise
to
evils
that
the
state
might
prevent.
i
was
quoting
from
his
opinion.
but
it's
really
not,
would
you
--
are
you
suggesting
to
us
that
danskin
is
an
authoritative
interpretation
by
the
california
courts
of
the
criminal
syndicalism
act?
justice
abe
fortas
which
case
is
that
i'm
sorry?
justice
abe
fortas
what's
your
--
how
do
you
make
that?
do
you
