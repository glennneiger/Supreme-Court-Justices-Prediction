would
we
have
to
extend
dombrowski
to
give
you
relief?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
has
the
government
of
california
done
to
anybody
other
than
harris?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
if
anything
has
the
government
or
any
government
official
done
to
anyone
of
the
plaintiffs
other
than
harris?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then,
is
it
not
true
that
we
have
to
extend
because
there
were
over
acts,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
but
is
there
anybody
has
been
searched?
justice
thurgood
marshall
any
documents
taken
from
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
any
threats
against
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
would
we
have
to
extend
dombrowski?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
you're
right
up
against
2283
or
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
as
a
result
of
that
this
aid
has
been
help
to
the
extent
that
for
four
years
they
have
been
able
to
move,
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
thing
we
have
before
us
is
the
injunction
and
whether
or
not
the
appellants
asked
for
it
or
anything
to
me
is
rather
unimportant.
he
did
issue
the
injunction
and
it
has
to
be
because
it's
against
2283.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
don't
see
what
jurisdiction
he
was
protecting.
he
could
issue
a
declaratory
judgment.
he
didn't
need
to
issue
an
injunction
to
protect
his
right
to
issue
a
declaratory
injunction.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
isn't
it
answered
very
simply
by
the
fact
that
he
hasn't
issued
a
declaratory
judgment
that
he
get?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
as
he
made
it
--
he
hadn't
made
it
final
yet.
what's
stopping
him
from
making
it
final?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
just
get
started
that
that
was
enough?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
so
if
we
offset
the
injunction
then
he
can
go
ahead
and
file
a
declaratory
judgment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
how
are
you
damaged?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
we
have
to
extend
dombrowski
to
give
you
relief?
