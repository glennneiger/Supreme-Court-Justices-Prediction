mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
by
the
district
attorney
of
los
angeles
county
in
california
from
a
judgment
order
of
the
district
court
in
los
angeles,
the
three-judge
district
court
convene
pursuant
to
a
complaint
filed
by
the
appellees
here
holding
the
california
criminal
syndicalism
act
void
on
its
face
in
all
of
its
provisions
and
particulars
and
regardless
of
how
it
might
be
applied.
in
addition,
the
three-judge
district
court
issued
an
injunction
against
the
district
attorney,
mr.
younger
enjoining
him
from
any
further
prosecution
of
john
harris
who
was
then
under
indictment
in
the
superior
court
of
los
angeles
county.
in
arriving
at
this
conclusion
one
which
has
been
appealed
here
by
both
the
district
attorney
who
was
the
party
below
and
the
attorney
general
of
california,
we
contend
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
that
the
district
court
should've
dismissed
the
complaint
to
start
with
and
if
it
did
reach
the
question
on
the
merits
that
the
proper
consideration
of
state
law
in
california
construing
the
criminal
syndicalism
act
would've
required
the
court
to
hold
that
the
statute
was
constitutional
and
not
unconstitutional.
and
we
ask
this
court
which
ever
it
might
choose
to
do
it
or
send
it
back
for
purposes
of
being
dismissed
because
we
don't
think
the
proper
case
to
start
with
or
if
you
wish
to
reach
the
merits
why
we
think
you
should
hold
it
a
valid
statute
in
light
of
the
california
decisions.
now,
we
say
that
the
court
should've
dismissed
this
complaint
below
without
any
further
ado.
john
harris
had
been
indicted
in
september
1967
or
september
of
1966
and
charged
in
two
counts
for
violation
of
the
criminal
syndicalism
act.
he
was
charged
with
passing
up
leaflets
which
advocated
criminal
means
for
bringing
about
changes
in
our
society
in
california.
the
leaflets
were
appended
to
the
indictments
as
usual
under
california
procedure.
he
was
furnished
the
transcript
of
all
of
the
testimony
at
the
grand
jury
which
shows
the
facts
underlying
the
prosecution.
none
of
that
is
before
you
and
now
that
was
before
the
district
court.
the
--
unlike
the
case
you
heard
argued
here
earlier,
there
were
not
related
counts
involving
the
possession
of
weapons
or
such
things.
in
addition,
the
criminal
syndicalism
act
should
not
be
confused
where
the
criminal
anarchy
statute
in
new
york.
they
both
stemmed
from
the
same
general
idea
and
as
does
in
smith
act
which
of
course
you
upheld.
but
the
california
act
instead
of
simply
stigmatizing
the
advocacy
of
the
forcible
overthrow,
the
overthrow
by
force
or
violence
of
the
government
speaks
quite
differently
and
it
addresses
itself
to
the
advocacy
of
particular
means
of
bringing
about
social
change.
and
it
lists
those
means
and
it
lists
some
very
specifically.
it
refers
to
the
commission
of
the
criminal
offense.
it
refers
to
sabotage.
it
refers
to
unlawful
acts
of
force
and
violence.
and
it
is
only
the
advocacy
of
these
criminal
means,
criminal
ways
of
change
--
bringing
about
changes
in
the
society
than
as
stigmatized.
the
objective
must
be
a
change
either
in
the
political
structure
or
a
change
economically.
the
whole
statute
having
been
drafted
at
a
time
when
the
advocacy
of
economic
change
perhaps
even
disregard
a
political
change
was
popular.
your
honors
have
held
recently
without
a
case
or
controversy,
the
district
court
has
no
jurisdiction
--
it
has
no
jurisdiction
constitutionally.
we
think
as
to
three
of
these
plaintiffs
it
was
clear
that
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction.
now,
harris
filed
this
complaint
and
he
was
awaiting
in
the
trial
on
his
indictment.
he
had
attacked
the
indictment
in
the
state
court.
he
had
asked
the
district
court
of
appeal
our
intermediate
appellate
court
for
writ
of
prohibition.
it
was
denied
there
and
he
applied
for
hearing
of
the
state's
supreme
court
denied
there.
under
our
procedures
the
higher
courts
have
discretion
to
rule
on
a
matter
of
that
kind
or
not
as
they
see
fit.
he
certainly
had
he
was
not
foreclosed
from
raising
the
constitutional
question,
later,
if
he
was
convicted
in
a
normal
appellate
process
but
he
went
into
the
federal
courts
and
perhaps
sensing
some
problem
under
section
2283.
he
brought
along
some
additional
plaintiffs.
two
of
them
were
members
of
the
progressive
labor
party.
harris,
i
believe
alleges
and
i
think
as
some
matter
of
fact
was
himself
a
number
of
the
progressive
labor
party.
and
they
said,
they
advocated
some
doctrine
seeking
change
and
industrial
ownership
and
so
forth
and
that
they
felt
inhibited
in
attempting
through
peaceful
none
violent
means
to
advocate
their
program.
and
therefore,
they
wanted
some
relief.
another
plaintiff
was
brought
in
named
broslawsky
who
was
a
teacher
at
one
of
the
state
colleges
out
there
and
he
said
he
taught
about
the
doctrines
of
karl
marx
and
he
taught
about
the
communist
manifesto
and
even
read
from
it.
by
now,
he
was
uncertain
as
to
what
he
could
say
in
light
of
this
statute.
now,
these
are
the
only
plaintiffs
before
the
court.
the
only
action
by
the
state
that
occurred
is
the
indictment
of
harris.
there
have
been
no
arrest,
searches,
no
announcements,
manifestos
as
you
found
in
dombrowski
about
what
anybody
is
going
to
do
to
this
group.
and
as
far
as
i
know
that
any
of
these
plaintiffs,
they
have
never
been
with
the
exception
of
harris
of
course.
they
have
never
been
charged
with
anything.
and
indeed,
the
district
court
after
proceeding
to
find
the
california
law
unconstitutional
on
its
face
stated
unequivocal
that
they
were
under
no
apprehension
and
that
there
was
any
danger
whatever
that
these
three
people
would
be
prosecuted.
or
that
the
courts
in
california
would
entertain
a
prosecution
on
the
grounds
that
they
stated
under
complaint.
now,
we
say
having
said
that
they
had
no
jurisdiction
as
far
as
these
plaintiffs
are
concerned.
and
we
rely
as
were
already
mentioned
here
on
your
decision
in
golden
against
zwickler
and
we
don't
think
these
people
had
presented
any
kind
of
a
case
or
controversy
to
the
court.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no.
i
want
to
come
to
him,
in
just
a
moment
your
honor.
he
does
stand
on
a
different
foot
and
he
was
indicted.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
exactly.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
exactly.
and
we
argue
some
other
things
that
there
was
no
irreparable
injury
other
than
his
own
prosecution.
there
was
no
pattern
of
prosecution.
there's
not
even
any
allegation
that
anybody
else
was
bothered
by
this
prosecution
or
was
likely
to
be
prosecuted
or
that
anything
--
any
of
all
of
the
facts
that
you
alluded
to
in
dombrowski
were
present.
we
think
specifically
as
to
the
injunction
in
connection
with
the
prosecution
of
harris
that
that
is
barred
by
section
2283
and
that
is
developed
in
our
brief.
i
don't
want
to
go
into
that
in
much
detail
except
to
say
this
that
this
case
presented
a
very
excellent
situation
for
the
application
of
the
abstention
doctrine
and
for
the
--
so
you
can
see
the
value
of
2283
in
failing
to
restraint
a
state
court
prosecution.
there
are
two
complaints
basically
about
the
california
statute.
one
is
that,
that
it
is
vague.
they
don't
know
what
it
means.
the
other
one
is
that
it's
overbroad
and
it
prohibits
things
that
they
should
be
allowed
to
do.
at
least
to
them
the
contention
of
the
--
of
harris
and
his
fellow
plaintiffs
is
that
they
don't
have
state
decisions
that
have
clarified
these
points.
now,
had
the
federal
district
court
declined
to
act
on
this
case
and
have
harris
ever
been
convicted.
in
the
appeal,
there's
no
question
but
that
the
--
any
vagueness
problem
that
there
is,
i'm
not
suggesting
there
is
a
vagueness
problem
--
they
think
there
is
could've
been
resolve
by
the
state
courts
and
in
defining
the
conduct
the
area
of
conduct
proscribed
perhaps
have
removed
completely
the
overbreadth
question
and
thus
remove
complete
any
necessity
of
a
constitutional
adjudication.
throughout
the
statute
doesn't
apply
to
what
you
might
think
is
protected
conduct
and
you‘ll
have
anything
to
decide.
this
case
was
a
perfect
vehicle
for
this
to
be
done
and
not
for
the
federal
district
court
to
show
what
we
think
in
all,
with
all
due
respect
was
unseemly
haste
in
declaring
the
california
state
law
unconstitutional.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
declaratory
judgment
aspect
your
honor
we
don't
think
that
zwickler
against
koota
is
controlling
here
that
prosecution
as
i
recall
had
been
completed
in
that
case,
in
the
local
--
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
exactly.
there
was
no
prosecution.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
certainly,
yes.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
exactly.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
as
to
i
think
as
to
the
declaratory
judgment
and
as
to
harris
i
think
that's
true.
i
think
it
is
a
matter
of
comity,
i
don't
think
that's
makes
it
unimportant
or
insignificant.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
it's
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
your
honor,
it
was
only
presented
by
means
of
the
interlocutory
motions
set
aside
the
indictment.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
and
the
attempt
to
invoke
the
discretionary
review
in
the
appellate
court.
you
have
no
right
to
go
to
the
appellate
courts
at
that
point.
general
proposition
mean
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
oh!
the
trial
court
did,
certainly
on
the
merits.
no
question
about
it.
but
i
think
in
addition
in
zwickler
you
had
a
very
clear
claim
of
simply
overbreadth
not
of
any
really
of
any
vagueness
or
only
problem
in
vagueness
in
the
statute
that
the
contention
was
covered
protected
conduct
and
that
was
going
to
have
to
be
reached.
in
our
case
is
quite
different.
now,
i
would
like
to
turn
if
i
might
to
what
i
think
is
the
more
important
question
here
and
that
is
the
merits
of
the
decision.
they
say
we
think
they
should
have
dismissed
it
summarily
but
they
didn't.
the
district
court
of
course
recognized
as
we
all
recognized
that
the
--
in
whitney
against
california
this
very
court
unanimously
had
sustained
the
statute
that
was
here
being
enforced.
but
i
think
what
they
didn't
do
was
recognized
what
had
happened
in
california
since
whitney
had
been
decided
and
i
think
what
they
did
not
do
was
recognize
that
some
of
the
very
issues
that
were
decided
here
were
decided
in
whitney
and
if
you
go
back
and
read
whitney
again,
so
you
think
--
may
think
of
it
as
a
discarded
decision.
but
the
very
same
claim
of
vagueness
that
is
raised
here
and
which
was
the
foundation
for
the
judgment
below
was
discussed
at
very
great
length
in
whitney
and
that
there
was
no
division
in
the
court
on
that
question
--
holmes
--
justices
holmes
and
brandeis
had
no
concern
about
the
vagueness
aspect
of
it.
they
didn't
it
was
vague.
and
indeed,
the
only
problem
they
saw
in
the
case
was
that
the
defendant
had
not
--
should've
not
an
opportunity
to
show
that
there
was
no
clear
and
present
danger
arising
from
her
particular
conduct.
and
they
felt
there
was
evidence
that
would
show
there
was
such
clear
and
present
danger.
that
is
the
--
of
some
eminence
of
violence
as
i
recall
and
so
they
joined
in
the
opinion
affirming
the
validity
of
the
california
criminal
syndicalism
act
or
it
has
not
been
backed
before
the
united
states
supreme
court
since
that.
and
it
would
be
naive
to
suggest
that
their
thinking
about
the
first
amendment
and
about
statute
hasn't
changed
somewhat.
although,
the
same
test
--
the
same
test
that
you
used
over
and
over
again
from
the
--
it's
the
connolly
decision
about
that
people
shouldn't
have
to
guess
it
at
the
meaning
of
words.
that
test
was
used
in
whitney
and
(inaudible)
basically
still
the
same
test.
all
right,
nevertheless,
there
has
been
a
certainly
of
some
changes
in
the
approach
and
in
the
thinking.
well,
this
was
recognized
in
california,
it
was
recognized
no
less
than
in
1946,
in
the
danskin
case.
a
case
which
construed
the
criminal
syndicalism
act
in
the
light
of
changes
in
the
laws
since
whitney
had
been
decided.
chief
justice
treanor
who
was
then
an
associate
justice
recognized
specifically
that
there
has
been
a
lot
happening
since
whitney
was
decided
and
we
got
look
at
this
again
in
light
of
what
is
happened
since
then
and
he
did.
and
he
--
it's
a
long
opinion
and
it
discusses
i
think
all
of
the
cases
that
had
intervened
and
all
of
the
concerns
that
this
court
has
manifested
over
the
years
with
the
need
for
protecting
free
speech
and
drawing
the
line
between
free
speech
and
illegal
advocacy.
and
he
even
in
that
opinion
announced
the
test
which
is
even
stricter
than
your
own
dennis
test.
he
said
that
the
danger
arose
by
the
speech
had
to
be
eminent
and
the
danger
had
to
be
a
danger
that
the
state
could
properly
prohibit.
and
let
me
remind
you
again
that
the
--
what
is
prohibited
here
was
the
advocacy
of
means
unlawful
acts,
criminal
acts,
violent
acts.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that
is
the
danskin
decision
your
honor.
danskin
versus
san
diego
unified
school
district
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes
sir,
that's
it.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
now,
it
might
be
i
suggested
that
this
was
not
a
criminal
prosecution
under
the
criminal
syndicalism
act.
what
is
was,
was
a
case
reviewing
the
action
of
a
local
school
board
in
applying
the
civic
center
act
in
california.
that
act
required
a
loyal
deal
in
effect
if
you
want
to
use
a
school
room
to
hold
a
meeting
and
all
that
you
did
not
or
had
not
advocated
the
overthrow
of
the
government.
and
it
was
argued
in
the
state
supreme
court
that
the
--
that
this
civic
center
act
in
its
all
of
its
requirement
was
a
supplement
to
the
criminal
syndicalism
act
and
it
was
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
that
act.
and
so
in
order
to
appraise
that
argument,
justice
treanor
addressed
himself
to
a
criminal
syndicalism
act
what
it
meant
and
what
it
prohibited
and
anybody
who
is
in
any
doubt
about
what
it
prohibits
can
find
in
that
opinion
what
it
does
prohibit.
he
made
it
very
clear
that
it
did
not
prohibit
the
advocacy
of
abstract
doctrines,
the
discussion
of
abstract
theory
was
never
intended
to
do
that
and
it
doesn't
do
that
and
no
one
should
be
in
any
doubt
in
california
about
the
reach
of
the
criminal
syndicalism
law.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
it
does
not
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
we
don't
know
your
honor.
he's
never
been
tried.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
maybe
he
was
not
in
violation
of
the
statute.
i
wouldn't
--
no
one
can
say
at
this
point,
that's
the
purpose
of
the
whole
trial
system.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
but
let
me
if
i
could
just
add
this
about
it.
the
indictments
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
and
i
suppose
we
all
do
and
put
the
best
cast
on
her
activities
in
a
complaint.
the
indictment
did
contain
the
leaflets
that
he
was
handing
out
on
these
occasions.
that
apparently
is
not
part
of
the
record
below.
he
didn't
handle
the
case.
the
district
attorney
handled
it
below.
if
you
explore
the
grand
jury
transcript
which
again
is
not
part
of
the
record
as
i
understand
it
below
and
incidentally
that
is
not
a
secret
document
in
california.
the
defendant
gets
a
copy
of
it
so
everybody
knows
what's
in
it.
what
really
happened
here
and
i'm
not
going
to
say
that
this
--
i'm
not
even
going
to
say
that
this
can
properly
be
prohibited.
i
don't
think
we've
reached
that
point
because
the
statute
wasn't
applied
to
him
and
he
has
the
all
opportunity
at
the
trial
to
explore
all
these
issues.
but
this
whole
incident
occurred
in
april
1966
about
six
months
after
the
great
watts
riots.
it
grew
out
of
the
shooting
and
killing
of
a
man
named
leonard
deadwyler
in
los
angeles.
he
was
a
black
man
and
it
turned
out
he
was
taking
his
pregnant
wife
to
hospital.
some
confusion
of
the
police
officer
and
he
sped
away
as
i
recall
and
the
police
officer
chased
him
and
later
he
corners
him,
stopped
him
and
later
corners
inquest
determined
that
the
officer
approached
the
car
with
a
weapon
being
fearful
of
the
situation.
he
leaned
on
the
door,
the
weapon
went
off
and
killed
mr.
deadwyler.
now,
there
was
great
fear
about
that
in
the
los
angeles
community.
the
district
attorney
felt
reviewing
the
case
that
that
it
was
not
a
cause
for
an
indictment
but
the
people
hadn't
know
what
it
happened
here.
and
a
corner's
inquest
was
held
that
which
all
witness
testified
to
what
happened.
i
don't
want
to
go
into
that
but
they
started
it
and
then
they
had
to
stop
because
it
was
just
too
much
disorder
and
unruly
behavior
so
they
moved
it
from
where
you
would
normally
hold
an
inquest
where
you'd
have
three
or
four
people
to
the
biggest
courtroom
and
of
course
county
courthouse
in
los
angeles
and
that
is
in
some
courtroom.
it's
much
bigger
than
this
room
and
it
holds
several
hundred
people.
the
place
was
completely
embraced
with
the
police.
the
audience
was
about
90%
black,
there
was
some
disruption
when
witnesses
booing
the
witnesses
that
sort
of
thing.
this
was
the
atmosphere
at
that
courthouse.
people
going
in
and
out
several
hundred
just
to
this
room
and
mr.
harris
was
out
there
handing
these
leaflets
out
in
this
setting
and
the
leaflet
--
i'm
not
certainly
would
read
the
whole
thing
but
it
says,
“wanted
for
the
murder
of
leonard
deadwyler,
bova
the
cop.”
and
that
sort
of
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
pardon
me?.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
it's
not
your
honor
i
have
the
indictment
here.
the
gist
of
it
was
that
watts
was
a
great
concentration
preempt,
bova
was
a
guard
and
deadwyler
an
inmate
and
we
have
to
exterminate
them
before
they
exterminate
us.
that
was
the
gist
of
it.
that
was
the
set
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
we
do.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
--
that
is
something
for
the
court
--
the
trial
court
to
determine
and
the
jury
to
determine,
i
think.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that
they
won't
be
convicted
unless
it
rises
to
that
level
of
advocacy.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
excitement
under
the
dennis
case
under
our
own
danskin
case
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
but
that
language
doesn't
stand
alone
your
honor.
that
language
has
been
construed.
it
was
construed
in
danskin,
it
was
construed
if
you
please
almost
50
years
ago
in
the
case
called
people
against
o'malley
that
we
cite
which
was
a
prosecution
under
this
very
section
handing
out
leaflets
and
that
sort
of
thing.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
that
was
a
long
time
ago.
let's
say
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
don't
think
there
are
many
in
the
30's,
the
great
bulk
of
them
i
believe
were
in
the
20's.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
only
know
in
addition
to
this
prosecution
one
other
prosecution
and
that
is
a
group
of
american
nazis
in
san
mateo
county.
we
found
some
things
in
the
course
of
that
investigation
that
we
thought
the
court
might
be
interested
in
and
that
kind
of
those
to
our
brief.
there
of
course
the
terrorism;
the
only
answer
to
terrorism
when
they
burned
our
flag
it's
time
for
violence.
all
of
these
addressed
toward
violence
toward
negroes
and
people
who
in
the
judgment
of
these
people
are
advocating
very
bad
causes.
i
think
your
honor
which
we've
tried
to
point
out
that
there
has
been
a
change
in
our
society.
it
isn't
that
somebody
suddenly
read
the
criminal
syndicalism
act
although
i
think
in
all
honesty
if
you
ask
a
thousand
people
about
in
california
you
wouldn't
get
an
answer
from
over
one
and
two;
maybe
in
the
whole
state.
it
isn't
because
somebody
suddenly
read
it
and
said,
let's
prosecute.
it's
because
the
advocacy
of
what
is
prohibited
here,
the
advocacy
of
bombing,
of
killing
of
these
things
as
means
of
social
changes.
not
generally
of
doing
let's
go
away
with
the
government
one
way
or
the
other.
the
advocacy
we
seen
in
california
and
that
this
statute
is
directed
to
is
the
advocacy
of
bombing,
the
advocacy
of
shooting,
killing
the
police,
specific
advocacy
of
specific
acts
and
this
renewal
of
this
kind
of
activity
maybe
this
is
not
what
happened
in
the
20's
or
the
turn
of
the
century
but
it's
said
that
that
sort
of
thing
happened
then
with
the
anarchist
and
syndicalist.
we
see
the
same
thing
again
happening
in
california
and
elsewhere
and
this
statute
has
suddenly
again
become
in
one
of
the
favorite
words
of
some
people,
are
they
relevant?
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
--
maybe
it
wasn't
for
a
long
time
but
it
is
not.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
correct.
well,
that's
correct
your
honor.
the
advocacy
of
violence
and
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
i
have
to
defend
the
statute
as
it's
written
and
i
do
defend
those
words.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
i
think
you
have
to
read
those
words
in
light
of
the
way
they've
been
construed.
not
as
if
i
made
them
up
here,
advocates
has
been
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
--
over
and
over
again.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
commission
of?
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
you
mean
in
aiding
and
abetting
the
commission
of?
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
is
it
the
aiding
and
the
abetting?
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
alright,
i
think
this
is
our
position
your
honor
that
advocating
and
teaching
of
the
keywords
and
their
words
of
art
and
aiding
and
abetting
is
the
customary
expression
in
california
to
define
an
accomplished
principle
in
a
second
class.
and
it's
not
even
written
in
the
most
statutes,
committing
murder
is
proscribed
but
if
you
aid
and
abet
the
commission
of
murder,
you're
punishable
as
principle
for
a
murder.
we
say
those
words
are
used
here
in
connection
with
advocating
and
teaching
and
that
refer
to
a
subsidiary
role
in
this
activity
with
guilty
knowledge
and
so
forth
just
as
if
for
any
other
crime.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
i
think
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
as
those
words
are
understood
by
all
of
us
and
have
been
explained
by
this
court
many,
many
times.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
and
by
the
california
courts.
i
think
i
have
to
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
it
was
in
1946
--
june
1946.
some
years
before
dennis
of
course
and
there
hasn't
been
anything
really
since
because
there
hasn't
been
any
prosecution.
this
case
had
been
tried
in
the
state
courts
and
appealed
what
are
presented
these
issues.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
only
one
is
prosecuted
under
the
one
that
prohibits
spreading
and
circulating,
distributing,
written
matter.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
exactly.
there
is
been
expressed
severability
clause
in
the
statute
and
for
there
are
cases
and
we
have
alluded
to
them
in
our
brief
holding
that
these
do
define
separate
crimes.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
everything,
every
part
of
it,
every
word
in
it
and
every
application
of
it.
thank
you.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
only
like
to
suggest
this
that
anybody
who
has
lived
in
california
and
reads
about
california
and
the
things
that
there
is
any
chilling
of
free
speech
and
it
was
free
expression
of
ideas
and
the
teaching
of
almost
anything
under
the
sun
with
all
due
respect
to
anyone
who
believes
that
i
have
to
say
i
can't
believe
it.
we
have
the,
i
think
the
broadest
free
speech
in
california
in
any
place
i
know.
fifty
years
ago,
the
district
court
of
appeal
in
maley
(ph)
and
i
think
it
was
the
district
court
held
that
it
wasn't
enough
to
just
talk
about
revolution
or
something,
you
had
to
have
the
intent
to
bring
about
what
should
the
illegal
means
that
you
were
advocating.
in
danskin
it
was
made
very
clear
that
this
statute
had
nothing
to
do
with
abstract
theories
and
that
would
suggest
that
anybody
is
afraid
to
talk
about
karl
marx
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
--
because
the
statute
is
just
isn't
true.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
sir.
yes,
i
am
your
honor.
i
think
it
is.
i
think
he
felt
he
had
to
reach
that
and
i
don't
think
that
this
statute
should
fall
because
of
some
debate
about
whether
it
was
if
there
were
holding
under
that
particular
situation.
i
think
it's
very
clear
from
the
opinion
even
if
it
weren't
clear
your
honor
i
would
suggest
that
this
court
has
a
duty
to
construe
the
statute
in
light
of
your
own
decisions.
that
regard
to
what
california
has
decided.
and
you
decided
dennis
and
scales
and
yates
and
these
words
are
not
new
and
you
get
them
very
limited
meanings
and
i
think
you
have
a
duty
to
construe
them
in
order
to
sustain
the
statute
and
not
an
order
to
destroy
it.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
that
certainly
what
it
did
here.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
it's
a
matter
so
much
of
application
of
the
statute.
that's,
i
think
what's
you're
suggesting
in
ruling
on
the
various
applications
that
might
be
made
that
you
can
make
soundly
you
can
make
other
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
that's
quite
is
too
vague
any
how
even
if
--
that's
a
little
different
concept.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
they
say
--
they
make
both
contentions
and
it
was
so
held
below.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
district
court
has
a
duty
to
construe
those
words.
they
don't
just
read
them
as
if
you
never
seen
them
at
all.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
no
but
no
--
they
are
the
state
court
and
i
don't
think
they
should
in
that
sense
try
to
be
one
but
no
lawyer
that
i
know
of
picks
up
a
statute
and
looks
at
it
and
says,
“well,
here's
the
word
“teach.”
so,
it's
going
to
have
something
to
do
with
teaching
in
a
classroom.”
none
of
these
construes
statutes
like
that.
first
thing
we
do
is
look
at
the
statute.
we
start
to
look
at
the
cases
and
i
suggest
what
the
district
court
didn't
do.
here,
had
it
done
that
i
think
i
would've
concluded
that
as
construed
and
as
narrowed
in
the
state
construction
this
statute
is
perfectly
valid.
i
say
it's
a
valid
on
its
face
as
has
been
construed.
but
even
if
you
weren't
satisfied
and
you
thought
danskin
was
devoted
to
something
else
and
the
other
cases
are
old
and
so
forth,
still
and
all
i
think
that
court
has
a
duty
to
construe
the
statute
to
uphold
it
and
not
to
strike
it
down.
and
this
court
said
so
in
fox
against
washington.
and
these
are
words,
we
may
use
the
same
words
that
you've
upheld
time
and
time
and
time
again.
and
now,
i
think
to
turn
around,
you
can
say
the
two
vague
or
overbroad
we
don't
understand
them
would
be
contrary
to
your
own
decisions
absolutely
unnecessary
for
the
protection
of
anybody's
rules.
thank
you.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
an
order
of
the
three-judge
court
in
the
central
district
in
california
declaring
the
california
criminal
syndicalism
act
unconstitutional
on
its
face
and
then
all
of
its
parts.
in
enjoining
the
district
attorney
of
los
angeles
county
from
enforcing
and
continuing
the
prosecution
of
a
man
named
john
harris,
jr.
who
was
one
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
the
appeal
is
brought
to
district
attorney
and
represented
here
by
the
attorney
general
of
california.
the
complaint
in
the
district
court
was
filed
by
john
harris,
jr.
following
his
indictment
upon
two
counts
of
violating
subsection
3
of
the
syndicalism
act.
he
claimed
in
the
complaint
by
reason
of
his
prosecution
and
the
presence
of
the
act.
he
was
inhibited
in
the
exercise
of
his
first
amendment
rights.
there
were
three
other
plaintiffs
who
joined
in
the
lawsuit,
jim
dan
and
hirsch
both
alleged
that
they
were
members
of
the
progressive
labor
party,
a
party
that
advocated
political
and
industrial
change
and
they
felt
inhibited
in
attempting
through
peaceful
and
non-violent
means
to
advocate
progressive
labor
party
programs
in
light
of
the
presence
of
the
statute
in
the
prosecution
of
john
harris.
the
fourth
plaintiff
was
a
man
named
broslawsky
who
alleged
that
he
was
a
teacher
of
history
and
he
taught
subjects
in
which
marxism
wasn't
involved
and
he
was
uncertain
what
he
could
say
about
these
matters
by
reason
of
the
presence
of
the
act
on
the
books
and
by
reason
to
prosecution
of
john
harris.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
at
a
state
college
--
san
fernando
state
college,
i
believe.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
the
plaintiffs
alleged
that
there
was
irreparable
injury.
he
alleged
no
specific
facts
in
support
of
this
claim
except
the
conclusion
that
they
felt
inhibited
and
were
prevented
from
exercising
fundamental
constitutional
rights.
the
district
court
held
that
it
had
jurisdiction
to
pass
on
all
phases
of
the
act
not
only
the
section
under
which
john
harris
was
prosecuted.
it
held
that
it
should
not
abstain
in
light
of
dombrowski
and
zwickler
against
koota.
the
district
court
went
on
to
hold
the
act
unconstitutional
on
its
face
and
all
of
its
provisions
were
no
mention
whatever
of
any
california
case
which
it
--
that
it
construed
any
of
the
sections
of
the
act.
finally,
the
court
issued
an
injunction
against
the
pending
prosecution
of
john
harris.
the
appellant
submits
here
that
the
district
court
had
no
jurisdiction
whatever
in
respect
to
the
claims
of
dan,
hirsch,
and
broslawsky
that
is
the
three
plaintiffs
who
have
not
been
indicted.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
there
is
no
such
allegation
your
honor
in
the
complaint
and
in
fact
the
district
court
said
in
the
opinion
that
it
did
not
believe
that
the
plaintiffs
stood
in
any
danger
or
whatever
of
prosecution
for
the
conduct
that
they
alleged,
that
they
had
engaged
in.
in
addition,
in
connection
with
the
jurisdictional
question
we
contend
that
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction
to
pass
on
a
ninth
provision
except
section
3.
the
section
under
which
john
harris
was
charged
and
upon
which
he
was
awaiting
trial.
secondly,
as
to
section
3,
the
district
court
should
have
abstained.
third,
on
the
merits
we
submit
that
the
act
is
valid
in
light
of
a
narrowing
state
constructions
and
a
number
of
state
cases
that
we
cited
in
our
brief.
finally,
all
of
the
things
fail
and
we
submit
that
an
injunction
was
barred
under
section
2283
of
title
28
and
that
there
was
no
irreparable
injury
in
support
of
the
injunctive
relief.
first
point
in
connection
with
the
lack
of
jurisdiction
in
respect
of
the
three
plaintiffs
other
than
john
harris
is
basically
on
the
proposition
that
there
were
no
overt
acts
by
the
state
of
california
or
any
representative
of
the
state
that
might
be
construed
in
any
way
to
have
inhibited
these
plaintiffs
in
the
exercise
of
federal
constitutional
rights.
there
had
been
no
arrest.
there
had
been
no
threat
of
arrest,
no
searches,
no
denunciation
of
these
plaintiffs.
the
only
claim
that
they
can
make
is
that
the
mere
presence
of
the
act
is
sufficient
to
create
a
case
or
controversy.
we
submit
that
it
is
not
and
we
submit
that
under
the
circumstances
here
the
action
of
the
district
court
amounted
to
an
advisory
opinion
on
an
abstract
question.
the
facts
are
set
forth
in
the
complaint
in
connection
with
these
three
plaintiffs
who
were
not
charged
do
not
show
any
substantial
controversy
between
parties
having
adverse
legal
interest
of
sufficient
immediacy
and
reality
to
warrant
declaratory
relief
and
to
give
right
to
a
case
or
controversy.
we
relied
principally
in
that
connection
upon
your
decision
last
term
in
golden
against
zwickler
or
he
dismissed
the
case
because
of
no
case
or
controversy
even
though
having
included
that
the
statute
was
arguably
overbroad
and
affecting
rights
on
the
first
amendment.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
for
four
years
or
thereabouts,
your
honor.
in
connection
with
harris
himself,
we
wouldn't
argue
that
there
is
only
an
abstract
question
--
he's
under
indictment
and
if
the
trial
has
ever
held
could
possibly
be
convicted,
but
he's
only
charged
under
section
3
of
the
act.
we
submit
that
the
district
court
had
no
jurisdiction
to
reach
to
other
sections
of
the
act.
there
are
five
sections
in
section
11401
that
deal
with
different
forms
of
conduct
and
declare
them
illegal
under
the
general
definition
of
criminal
syndicalism
contained
in
section
11400.
the
legislature
provided
in
connection
with
this
act
that
if
any
portion
of
it
for
example
section
3
which
relates
to
the
distributing
of
handbills
and
alike,
printing
matters
and
things
of
that
kind.
that
if
any
part
should
be
held
unconstitutional,
the
rest
remaining
portions
should
be
sustained.
we
have
argued
in
our
brief
that
in
the
smith
act
cases
and
the
smith
act
had
a
structure
very
similar
to
this
with
membership
provision,
with
a
printing
or
distributing
section,
in
those
cases.
this
court
took
each
section
and
examined
that
section
and
declined
to
pass
on
other
sections
only
the
section
that
was
specifically
involved
and
had
been
invoked
against
the
particular
defendants
there
are
dennis,
and
the
yates
case
and
in
the
scales
case.
we
think
that
one
of
the
problems
in
this
case
is
that
the
district
court
in
passing
upon
sections
of
the
act
that
have
not
been
invoked
or
sections
of
the
act
as
to
which
there
was
no
actual
controversy.
for
example,
section
4
is
a
membership
clause
provision.
it
prohibits
organizing.
it
prohibits
knowingly
becoming
a
member
of
a
criminal
syndicalist
organization
as
defined
therein.
this
was
struck
down
by
the
district
court.
harris
was
not
prosecuted
under
this
section.
there
was
no
contention
by
the
district
attorney
nor
has
there
been
any
contention
by
anyone
in
california
that
the
group
to
which
harris
belongs,
the
progressive
labor
party
i
believe,
is
a
proscribe
organization
or
that
belonging
to
it
there
constitutes
any
crime.
in
short,
there
was
no
actual
controversy
on
that
question.
and
we
think
one
of
the
problems
without
--
when
you
don't
have
an
actual
controversy
and
this
case
may
illustrate
that
is
it
there
is
not
an
informed
judgment
passed
by
the
district
court
--
the
pertinent
cases
and
we
cited
some
of
the
cases.
apparently,
we're
never
considered
by
the
court
and
we
think
this
was
due
probably
because
of
the
district
attorney
was
not
interested
in
the
membership
clause.
he
was
not
prosecuting.
harris
had
not
been
charged
under
the
membership
clause
and
he
was
interested
only
in
an
abstract
way
in
the
validity
of
that
section.
we
submit
that
the
decision
here
is
concrete
proof
of
what
happens
when
a
court
goes
ahead
and
in
effect
issues
an
advisory
opinion.
there
isn't
enough
interest
in
the
case
apparently
to
give
the
informed
judgment
that
constitutional
adjudication
that
we
submit
calls
for.
now,
in
connection
with
section
3,
with
the
only
section
we
feel
was
properly
before
the
district
court.
we
think
the
district
court
should
have
abstained
with
three
reasons
why
we
believe
this
to
be
true.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
section
3,
yes
justice
brennan.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
i
will.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes
it
has
--
it
has
been
construe.
we
think
the
court
should've
abstained
for
three
reasons
even
though
we
don't
argue
jurisdiction
as
to
subsection
3
in
connection
with
john
harris.
in
the
first
place,
this
law
was
acceptable
of
a
narrowing
interpretation
that
would
by
resolving
vagueness
in
the
terms
of
the
statute
show
any
problem
of
overbreadth.
and
thus,
we
submit
there
was
a
reasonable
expectation
that
there
would
no
necessity
to
adjudicate
the
constitutional
limits
of
the
states
legislation
in
this
field.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
circulating
actually,
two
handbills
in
the
course
of
a
corner's
inquest
in
los
angeles.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
the
handbills
are
set
forth
in
an
appendix
filed
by
the
petitioner
--
the
appellees
here
and
in
essence
it
was
directed
to
--
well,
we
have
to
give
a
little
bit
of
background.
this
event
occurred
in
may
of
1966,
the
inquest.
this
was
some
six
months
--
eight
months
after
the
watts
riots
in
los
angeles
county.
the
inquest
concerns
the
death
of
a
man
named
leonard
deadwyler
who
had
been
shot
by
a
police
officer,
stopping
him
believing
he
was
driving
on
the
influence
of
intoxicating
liquors.
and
accidentally,
a
gun
was
discharged
and
the
--
mr.
deadwyler
was
dead.
the
officer
was
named
bova.
the
first
of
the
handbills
that
are
set
forth
and
attached
to
the
indictment
refers
to
bova
the
cop.
it
says,
“wanted
for
the
murder
of
leonard
deadwyler”.
the
statement
is
made
“they”
referring
to
the
police
department
must
all
be
wipeout
before
there
is
complete
freedom.
south
los
angeles
watts
is
one
big
concentration
camp
and
so
forth,
that
goes
on
for
two
or
three
pages.
this
is
in
the
appendix
to
the
appellee's
supplemental
brief
on
reargument.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
those
are
illustrative
matter.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
that's
from
the
black
panther
paper
in
san
francisco.
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
--
with
the
facts
of
this
particular
case.
those
are
illustrative
of
the
conditions
that
we
submitted
at
that
time
warranted
to
the
upholding
of
this
act.
in
connection
with
the
question
of
abstention,
we
say
the
state
law
can
be
saved
and
if
it
can
be
saved
is
will
avoid
a
constitutional
decision
by
the
federal
courts
be
at
the
district
court
or
this
court.
and
that's
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
doctrine.
there
is
a
pending
vehicle
in
the
indictment
of
john
harris
and
if
he's
ever
tried
the
trial
and
his
appeal.
finally,
there's
no
evidence
whatever
and
nor
is
that
even
claimed
that
there
has
been
bad-faith
enforcements
of
the
statute
for
the
purpose
of
denying
the
people
of
california
their
federal
constitutional
rights.
there
is
a
contention
that
many
years
ago,
this
may
have
occurred
but
there
is
no
contention
that
at
or
about
that
time
this
case
was
filed
and
decided
in
los
angeles.
there
was
any
bad
faith
enforcement
of
the
act.
we
say
that
this
act
is
susceptible
to
a
clarifying
and
a
narrowing
construction
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first
of
all
there
been
a
number
of
cases
in
california
that
have
passed
on
various
provisions
of
the
act
since
it
was
enacted
in
1919.
the
great
flurry
of
prosecutions
arose
that
between
1919
and
1924
and
there
has
been
very
little
only
in
this
case
having
reached
any
kind
of
appellate
statute
since
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
it's
a
blue
cover
mr.
brennan
and
it's
an
appendix
to
that
supplemental
brief.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
it's
filed
by
the
appellees
not
by
the
appellant.
the
decision
over
20
years
ago
in
the
danskin
case
by
justice
traynor
made
a
very
clear
that
in
the
view
of
california
supreme
court
--
the
california
criminal
syndicalism
act
couldn't
be
evaluated
simply
on
its
face
and
in
its
own
terms.
but
it
had
to
be
evaluated
in
light
of
decisions
by
this
court
in
the
area
for
the
first
amendment.
in
fact,
justice
traynor
said
that
the
act
could
only
be
applied
to
prohibit
conduct
where
there
was
imminent
danger
but
advocacy
will
give
rise
to
the
evils
that
the
state
may
properly
prevent.
that
is
language
that
is
very
reminiscent
and
it's
very
close
to
the
language
by
this
court
in
the
brandenburg
case
last
term
when
you
struck
down
the
ohio
criminal
syndicalism
law
on
the
ground
that
it
was
not
limited
to
speech
or
advocacy
directed
to
inciting
violent
action,
and
it
contained
no
conditions
that
such
action
be
likely
under
the
circumstances.
we
submit
that
a
fair
reading
of
danskin
gives
a
very
close
parallel
with
your
decision
in
brandenburg
and
you
can
reasonably
anticipate
that
the
california
supreme
court
if
it
sustains
the
law
at
all
would
sustain
it
under
that
kind
of
a
clarifying
and
narrowing
construction.
now,
in
connection
with
section
3
itself,
the
so-called
circulating
or
distributing
search
in
the
o'malley
case
which
the
people
against
o'malley
which
is
cited
in
our
briefs.
the
state
court
many
years
ago
in
anticipation
of
many
of
the
doctrines
that
have
developed
held
that
to
prosecute
and
convict
a
person
under
this
section
it
had
to
be
proven
that
he
understood
the
doctrines
in
the
material
and
the
handbills
that
he
was
handing
out.
that
he
wasn't
just
out
there
handing
out
something
because
somebody
told
him
to.
he
had
to
understand
it
and
he
had
to
intend
to
bring
about
the
consequences
that
is
the
unlawful
acts,
the
unlawful
means,
terroristic
means
that
are
proscribed
under
the
statute.
he
had
to
have
to
intent
himself
to
do
that
and
in
addition
there
had
to
be
a
clear
and
present
danger
of
such
unlawful
acts
necessary.
this
is
very
close
we
submit
to
what
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
held
in
the
intervening
years
in
the
dennis
case
and
many
other
cases.
look
into
new
york
to
anticipate
state
court
action
in
the
epton
case.
they
said
the
criminal
anarchy
statute
there
was
given
a
narrow
construction.
look
into
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
this
field
the
smith
act
cases.
all
that
gave
a
clarifying
and
narrowing
construction
to
those
sections
the
dennis,
yates,
and
scales
decisions
and
they
each
--
each
of
those
cases
finds
its
parallel
in
one
of
the
provisions
in
the
criminal
syndicalism
act.
this
is
my
case
such
as
baggett
--
the
baggett
case,
zwickler
case,
zwickler
against
koota.
what
the
court
felt
that
there
was
no
chance
of
the
statute
could
be
saved
but
in
effect
an
expression
but
it
could
not
be
saved
by
narrowing
construction.
in
fact
we
think
this
is
a
classic
example
of
the
other
extreme.
a
case
that
can
and
i
would,
in
speaking
of
the
probabilities
which
i
suppose
were
concerned
with
it
in
this
issue.
the
odds
are
certainly
very
heavy
that
this
statute
can
be
saved
and
that
it
would
be
saved
by
the
california
courts
if
ever
presented
to
them.
now,
there
is
a
case
at
the
moment
and
that
is
the
prosecution
of
john
harris.
if
he
is
found
guilty
and
since
he
has
absolute
right
to
appeal
his
conviction
and
have
the
validity
of
the
conviction
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
the
indictment
is
a
typical
indictment
in
california.
california
indictments
are
in
the
language
of
the
statute
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
in
the
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
it's
not
reprinted
but
it
is
charged
with
having
as
accuse
of
having
violated
this
particular
section
114013
of
the
penal
code.
then,
it
goes
on
to
say
that
on
or
about
the
certain
date
he
did
willfully,
unlawfully
and
feloniously
issue
circulate
and
so
forth
certain
papers
and
forms
that
contained
written
and
printed
advocacy
of
in
effect
criminal
syndicalism.
advocating
terrorism
and
advising
the
commission
of
crime
etcetera.
it's
really
lengthy
because
the
statute
itself
is
rather
lengthy.
and
in
addition
attached
to
the
indictment
is
the
specific
handbill
he
handed
out
on
each
occasion.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
good.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
the
indictment
starts
at
page
3
of
this
appendix
and
it
runs
for
quite
a
number
of
pages
because
there
were
two
different
days,
two
different
handbills
and
two
different
counts
in
this
indictment.
it
should
--
the
indictment
should
be
read
in
light
of
the
california
procedure
wherein
the
defendant
has
made
available
to
him
the
grand
jury
transcript
automatically
without
any
question
asked
so
that
to
charge
him
simply
in
the
language
of
the
statute
doesn't
prejudice
him.
he
confined
exactly
what
the
evidence
was
and
pinpoint
the
charge.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
we
submit
your
honor
that
under
the
standard
california
procedure,
the
first
opportunity
in
the
trial
court
would
be
when
instructions
are
given
to
the
jury.
now,
the
question
might
arise
in
connection
with
evidence
as
it's
offered
but
by
at
large,
i
would
think
it
would
be
--
the
elements
would
be
set
forth
in
the
instructions
to
the
jury.
the
conditions,
the
things
that
jury
has
to
find
in
order
to
convict
this
man.
now,
it's
been
contended
here
that
the
harris
moved
under
995
of
the
penal
code
to
dismiss
the
indictment,
that
motion
was
denied.
he
demurred
to
the
indictment
on
the
ground
that
the
statute
upon
which
the
indictment
was
founded
was
void
on
its
face.
the
demur
was
denied.
the
motion
under
995
was
denied.
now,
those
are
simply
trial
court
rulings.
the
harris
then
applied
to
a
district
court
of
appeals
under
section
999
(a)
of
the
penal
code.
now,
this
is
special
california
procedure.
under
995,
you
can
attack
an
indictment
on
the
grounds
either
that
the
indictment
was
unlawfully
returned
something
some
error
occurred
in
the
process
or
in
the
ground
is
not
probable
cause
to
hold
the
defendant
to
answer.
and
this
turns
on
the
evidence
before
the
grand
jury,
it's
an
evidentiary
issue.
now,
if
this
is
denied,
california
has
a
special
statutory
procedure
999
(a)
and
i
don't
know
of
anything
similar
in
federal
practice
and
it's
a
very
good
provision
whereby
you
can
go
to
the
appellate
court,
the
intermediate
appellate
court
and
asked
for
a
writ
of
prohibition
under
the
section
on
the
ground
that
you're
being
held
without
probable
cause
and
you
shouldn't
put
all
the
trouble
of
the
trial.
999
(a)
however,
is
limited
to
this
issue
whether
or
not
the
defendant
is
being
held
without
probable
cause.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
that's
correct
your
honor.
that
is
the
only
issue
that
may
properly
be
raised
under
the
special
statutory
writ.
now,
the
question
of
whether
the
statute
is
itself
valid
on
its
face
and
similar
question
can't
be
raised
at
that
point.
this
is
simply
to
determine
should
the
man
be
held
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
i
think
we
don't
have
any
present
as
to
precisely
what
would
happen
under
those
circumstances
your
honor,
but
i
think
clear
and
present
danger
is
one
of
those
elements
that
would
be
tested
at
the
trial
as
oppose
to
the
grand
jury
indictment.
the
grand
jury
indictment
is
just
put
the
man
to
trial
not
to
convict
him
and
there
is
an
evidence
in
this
transcript
which
would
indicate
the
clear
and
present
danger.
but,
i
don't
think
that
under
our
procedure
it's
called
for
that
particular
time.
now,
it's
been
argued
that
the
application
for
999
(a)
relief
which
was
denied
and
then
a
petition
for
hearing
to
the
california
supreme
court
was
denied.
it's
been
claimed
by
the
appellees
that
this
in
effect
gave
the
state
court
a
chance
to
limit
the
statute
in
its
application
and
they
didn't
take
that
chance.
we
don't
think
that
is
a
sound
argument
for
the
reasons
i've
mentioned.
999
(a)
does
not
embrace
that
question
of
this
kind.
it
embraces
only
the
question
evidentiary
question.
secondly,
there
are
considerations
in
any
pretrial
motion
of
this
kind
in
addition
to
the
legal
question
that
is
presented.
there
is
a
question
of
whether
you
should
disrupt
the
criminal
trial
or
whether
you
should
not
whether
you
should
let
him
proceed.
the
application
of
the
state
supreme
court
is
like
the
application
to
this
court
for
certiorari
so
probably
discretionary.
and
we
don't
think
this
issue
has
been
properly
presented
to
the
california
courts.
we're
confident
that
when
it
is,
the
statute
will
be
limited
and
brought
within
constitutional
limitations.
the
place
in
california
procedure
where
this
should
really
be
accomplished
is
in
the
jury
instructions
and
then
if
those
are
not
adequate
in
the
event
that
harris
is
convicted
of
course.
possibility
is
he
may
not
be.
if
he
is
convicted
there
can
be
a
review
on
a
full
record
of
the
instructions
as
applied
under
the
evidence
in
light
of
the
statute
and
all
of
their
controlling
cases
--
not
a
simple
question,
a
complex
question.
we
think
that
that
is
the
time
for
review
and
think
it
will
not
prejudice
john
harris
to
wait
that
time
for
review
of
the
interest
which
he
is
concerned.
and
that
is
whether
he's
going
to
be
held
guilty
of
violating
subsection
3.
certainly,
the
trial
court
in
passing
on
a
demur
that
was
--
it
was
no
authority
of
interpretation
by
the
state
courts
of
this
section
of
the
criminal
syndicalism
act.
now,
there
are
procedures
available
in
california
that
perhaps
could
secure
a
ruling
pretrial
on
this
question.
they
were
not
invoked
here,
habeas
corpus
might
lie.
a
rare
prohibition
in
the
sense
of
the
normal
extraordinary
writ
not
the
special
statutory
999
(a)
might
possibly
lie
in
this
situation.
these
things
were
not
done.
these
were
the
cases
that
are
referred
to
in
the
briefs
filed
by
the
appellees
as
showing
this
opportunity
given
to
the
state
courts.
i'd
like
to
save
any
time
that
i
have
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
four
minutes
your
honor.
i
didn't
get
to
the
last
two
points
in
opening
remarks
was
the
time
of
problem.
i
didn't
mean
to
waive
any
point
in
connection
with
either
the
merits
of
the
act
or
the
impact
of
section
2283
which
we
set
forth
a
very
considerable
length
in
our
brief.
we
think
it
barred
the
injunction
here
in
looking
at
the
complaint
which
is
--
appears
in
the
appendix
and
on
at
page
7
it
is
quite
apparent
to
me
that
a
permanent
injunction
was
prayed
for
a
temporary
restraining
order
and
a
preliminary
injunction
in
fact
were
all
prayed
for
by
the
plaintiff
john
harris
and
by
the
other
plaintiffs
here.
we
are
--
we
still
urge
and
i
think
if
you
examine
the
cases
that
have
been
cited
by
the
appellees
that
the
999
(a)
procedure
does
not
permit
the
raising
of
the
constitutional
question
that
they
presented
here.
the
argued
it
but
they
didn't
do
it
within
a
procedural
framework.
they
would
permit
the
state
courts
to
decide
it.
we
also
submit
that
however,
whatever
our
view
might
be
or
whatever
the
district
court's
understanding
might
be
of
the
procedural
niceties
in
california
shouldn't
be
determinative
of
this
case.
the
2283
still
bars
an
injunction
without
any
regard
to
what
interlocutory
procedures
are
provided
for
in
california.
and
as
far
as
the
declaratory
judgment
is
concerned,
we
urged
that
the
statute
can
properly
be
save
and
under
what
is
clear
this
is
a
consideration
that
should've
prompt
the
district
court
to
abstain
and
let
the
statute
be
thrash
out
in
the
state
courts
and
let
john
harris
have
his
remedy
and
i
think
there
can
be
no
real
doubt
that
he
has
a
real
and
meaningful
remedy
within
the
california
courts.
only
a
week
ago,
monday,
this
court
in
o'leary
against
schneider
number
1225
affirm
per
curiam
a
case
out
of
louisiana
where
the
federal
district
court
have
abstained
from
getting
into
a
louisiana
prosecution.
and
there,
there
had
been
an
application
to
the
louisiana
courts,
in
fact,
an
application
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court
for
relief
by
the
defendant
during
the
course
of
his
application
to
the
federal
court.
this
was
not
deemed
to
be
of
any
great
consequence
under
their
particular
situation
and
we
think
it
is
somewhat
comparable
with
the
situation
here.
now,
what
the
procedural
niceties
are
in
louisiana,
i
have
no
idea.
and
we
don't
think
that
that
this
case
should
turn
on
that.
2283
clearly
barred
the
injunction,
the
statute
can
be
salvaged
and
so
far
as
harris
is
concerned
and
certainly
no
more
than
the
one
prosecution
that
he
is
facing.
there
is
no
--
i
think
the
delay
here
is
mentioned
in
a
question
has
been
very
considerable.
now,
the
case
proceeded
in
the
state
courts
and
no
doubt
it
would
have
been
terminated
long
sentence
and
we
stand
here
four
years
with
the
state
of
california
in
the
situation
of
been
unable
to
proceed
against
john
harris
whatever
the
merits
of
that
case
might
be,
and
more
importantly
unable
to
proceed
within
the
constitutional
limits
of
the
criminal
syndicalism
act.
it's
not
a
question
of
zealous
prosecution.
it's
a
question
of
enforcing
the
law
within
the
proper
constitutional
limits
that
this
court
has
laid
down
and
it
certainly
suggest
in
brandenburg
that
within
the
criminal
syndicalism
act
there
is
an
area
within
which
the
state
may
properly
act
or
prohibit
the
advocacy
of
criminal
means
whether
it
be
killing
all
cops,
whether
it
be
blowing
up
a
building,
person
or
whatever.
we
think
the
state
should
be
able
to
prove
the
causative
relationship
between
the
advocacy
and
these
criminal
acts.
thank
you.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
by
the
district
attorney
of
los
angeles
county
in
california
from
a
judgment
order
of
the
district
court
in
los
angeles,
the
three-judge
district
court
convene
pursuant
to
a
complaint
filed
by
the
appellees
here
holding
the
california
criminal
syndicalism
act
void
on
its
face
in
all
of
its
provisions
and
particulars
and
regardless
of
how
it
might
be
applied.
in
addition,
the
three-judge
district
court
issued
an
injunction
against
the
district
attorney,
mr.
younger
enjoining
him
from
any
further
prosecution
of
john
harris
who
was
then
under
indictment
in
the
superior
court
of
los
angeles
county.
in
arriving
at
this
conclusion
one
which
has
been
appealed
here
by
both
the
district
attorney
who
was
the
party
below
and
the
attorney
general
of
california,
we
contend
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
that
the
district
court
should've
dismissed
the
complaint
to
start
with
and
if
it
did
reach
the
question
on
the
merits
that
the
proper
consideration
of
state
law
in
california
construing
the
criminal
syndicalism
act
would've
required
the
court
to
hold
that
the
statute
was
constitutional
and
not
unconstitutional.
and
we
ask
this
court
which
ever
it
might
choose
to
do
it
or
send
it
back
for
purposes
of
being
dismissed
because
we
don't
think
the
proper
case
to
start
with
or
if
you
wish
to
reach
the
merits
why
we
think
you
should
hold
it
a
valid
statute
in
light
of
the
california
decisions.
now,
we
say
that
the
court
should've
dismissed
this
complaint
below
without
any
further
ado.
john
harris
had
been
indicted
in
september
1967
or
september
of
1966
and
charged
in
two
counts
for
violation
of
the
criminal
syndicalism
act.
he
was
charged
with
passing
up
leaflets
which
advocated
criminal
means
for
bringing
about
changes
in
our
society
in
california.
the
leaflets
were
appended
to
the
indictments
as
usual
under
california
procedure.
he
was
furnished
the
transcript
of
all
of
the
testimony
at
the
grand
jury
which
shows
the
facts
underlying
the
prosecution.
none
of
that
is
before
you
and
now
that
was
before
the
district
court.
the
--
unlike
the
case
you
heard
argued
here
earlier,
there
were
not
related
counts
involving
the
possession
of
weapons
or
such
things.
in
addition,
the
criminal
syndicalism
act
should
not
be
confused
where
the
criminal
anarchy
statute
in
new
york.
they
both
stemmed
from
the
same
general
idea
and
as
does
in
smith
act
which
of
course
you
upheld.
but
the
california
act
instead
of
simply
stigmatizing
the
advocacy
of
the
forcible
overthrow,
the
overthrow
by
force
or
violence
of
the
government
speaks
quite
differently
and
it
addresses
itself
to
the
advocacy
of
particular
means
of
bringing
about
social
change.
and
it
lists
those
means
and
it
lists
some
very
specifically.
it
refers
to
the
commission
of
the
criminal
offense.
it
refers
to
sabotage.
it
refers
to
unlawful
acts
of
force
and
violence.
and
it
is
only
the
advocacy
of
these
criminal
means,
criminal
ways
of
change
--
bringing
about
changes
in
the
society
than
as
stigmatized.
the
objective
must
be
a
change
either
in
the
political
structure
or
a
change
economically.
the
whole
statute
having
been
drafted
at
a
time
when
the
advocacy
of
economic
change
perhaps
even
disregard
a
political
change
was
popular.
your
honors
have
held
recently
without
a
case
or
controversy,
the
district
court
has
no
jurisdiction
--
it
has
no
jurisdiction
constitutionally.
we
think
as
to
three
of
these
plaintiffs
it
was
clear
that
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction.
now,
harris
filed
this
complaint
and
he
was
awaiting
in
the
trial
on
his
indictment.
he
had
attacked
the
indictment
in
the
state
court.
he
had
asked
the
district
court
of
appeal
our
intermediate
appellate
court
for
writ
of
prohibition.
it
was
denied
there
and
he
applied
for
hearing
of
the
state's
supreme
court
denied
there.
under
our
procedures
the
higher
courts
have
discretion
to
rule
on
a
matter
of
that
kind
or
not
as
they
see
fit.
he
certainly
had
he
was
not
foreclosed
from
raising
the
constitutional
question,
later,
if
he
was
convicted
in
a
normal
appellate
process
but
he
went
into
the
federal
courts
and
perhaps
sensing
some
problem
under
section
2283.
he
brought
along
some
additional
plaintiffs.
two
of
them
were
members
of
the
progressive
labor
party.
harris,
i
believe
alleges
and
i
think
as
some
matter
of
fact
was
himself
a
number
of
the
progressive
labor
party.
and
they
said,
they
advocated
some
doctrine
seeking
change
and
industrial
ownership
and
so
forth
and
that
they
felt
inhibited
in
attempting
through
peaceful
none
violent
means
to
advocate
their
program.
and
therefore,
they
wanted
some
relief.
another
plaintiff
was
brought
in
named
broslawsky
who
was
a
teacher
at
one
of
the
state
colleges
out
there
and
he
said
he
taught
about
the
doctrines
of
karl
marx
and
he
taught
about
the
communist
manifesto
and
even
read
from
it.
by
now,
he
was
uncertain
as
to
what
he
could
say
in
light
of
this
statute.
now,
these
are
the
only
plaintiffs
before
the
court.
the
only
action
by
the
state
that
occurred
is
the
indictment
of
harris.
there
have
been
no
arrest,
searches,
no
announcements,
manifestos
as
you
found
in
dombrowski
about
what
anybody
is
going
to
do
to
this
group.
and
as
far
as
i
know
that
any
of
these
plaintiffs,
they
have
never
been
with
the
exception
of
harris
of
course.
they
have
never
been
charged
with
anything.
and
indeed,
the
district
court
after
proceeding
to
find
the
california
law
unconstitutional
on
its
face
stated
unequivocal
that
they
were
under
no
apprehension
and
that
there
was
any
danger
whatever
that
these
three
people
would
be
prosecuted.
or
that
the
courts
in
california
would
entertain
a
prosecution
on
the
grounds
that
they
stated
under
complaint.
now,
we
say
having
said
that
they
had
no
jurisdiction
as
far
as
these
plaintiffs
are
concerned.
and
we
rely
as
were
already
mentioned
here
on
your
decision
in
golden
against
zwickler
and
we
don't
think
these
people
had
presented
any
kind
of
a
case
or
controversy
to
the
court.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no.
i
want
to
come
to
him,
in
just
a
moment
your
honor.
he
does
stand
on
a
different
foot
and
he
was
indicted.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
exactly.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
exactly.
and
we
argue
some
other
things
that
there
was
no
irreparable
injury
other
than
his
own
prosecution.
there
was
no
pattern
of
prosecution.
there's
not
even
any
allegation
that
anybody
else
was
bothered
by
this
prosecution
or
was
likely
to
be
prosecuted
or
that
anything
--
any
of
all
of
the
facts
that
you
alluded
to
in
dombrowski
were
present.
we
think
specifically
as
to
the
injunction
in
connection
with
the
prosecution
of
harris
that
that
is
barred
by
section
2283
and
that
is
developed
in
our
brief.
i
don't
want
to
go
into
that
in
much
detail
except
to
say
this
that
this
case
presented
a
very
excellent
situation
for
the
application
of
the
abstention
doctrine
and
for
the
--
so
you
can
see
the
value
of
2283
in
failing
to
restraint
a
state
court
prosecution.
there
are
two
complaints
basically
about
the
california
statute.
one
is
that,
that
it
is
vague.
they
don't
know
what
it
means.
the
other
one
is
that
it's
overbroad
and
it
prohibits
things
that
they
should
be
allowed
to
do.
at
least
to
them
the
contention
of
the
--
of
harris
and
his
fellow
plaintiffs
is
that
they
don't
have
state
decisions
that
have
clarified
these
points.
now,
had
the
federal
district
court
declined
to
act
on
this
case
and
have
harris
ever
been
convicted.
in
the
appeal,
there's
no
question
but
that
the
--
any
vagueness
problem
that
there
is,
i'm
not
suggesting
there
is
a
vagueness
problem
--
they
think
there
is
could've
been
resolve
by
the
state
courts
and
in
defining
the
conduct
the
area
of
conduct
proscribed
perhaps
have
removed
completely
the
overbreadth
question
and
thus
remove
complete
any
necessity
of
a
constitutional
adjudication.
throughout
the
statute
doesn't
apply
to
what
you
might
think
is
protected
conduct
and
you‘ll
have
anything
to
decide.
this
case
was
a
perfect
vehicle
for
this
to
be
done
and
not
for
the
federal
district
court
to
show
what
we
think
in
all,
with
all
due
respect
was
unseemly
haste
in
declaring
the
california
state
law
unconstitutional.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
declaratory
judgment
aspect
your
honor
we
don't
think
that
zwickler
against
koota
is
controlling
here
that
prosecution
as
i
recall
had
been
completed
in
that
case,
in
the
local
--
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
exactly.
there
was
no
prosecution.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
certainly,
yes.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
exactly.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
as
to
i
think
as
to
the
declaratory
judgment
and
as
to
harris
i
think
that's
true.
i
think
it
is
a
matter
of
comity,
i
don't
think
that's
makes
it
unimportant
or
insignificant.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
it's
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
your
honor,
it
was
only
presented
by
means
of
the
interlocutory
motions
set
aside
the
indictment.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
and
the
attempt
to
invoke
the
discretionary
review
in
the
appellate
court.
you
have
no
right
to
go
to
the
appellate
courts
at
that
point.
general
proposition
mean
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
oh!
the
trial
court
did,
certainly
on
the
merits.
no
question
about
it.
but
i
think
in
addition
in
zwickler
you
had
a
very
clear
claim
of
simply
overbreadth
not
of
any
really
of
any
vagueness
or
only
problem
in
vagueness
in
the
statute
that
the
contention
was
covered
protected
conduct
and
that
was
going
to
have
to
be
reached.
in
our
case
is
quite
different.
now,
i
would
like
to
turn
if
i
might
to
what
i
think
is
the
more
important
question
here
and
that
is
the
merits
of
the
decision.
they
say
we
think
they
should
have
dismissed
it
summarily
but
they
didn't.
the
district
court
of
course
recognized
as
we
all
recognized
that
the
--
in
whitney
against
california
this
very
court
unanimously
had
sustained
the
statute
that
was
here
being
enforced.
but
i
think
what
they
didn't
do
was
recognized
what
had
happened
in
california
since
whitney
had
been
decided
and
i
think
what
they
did
not
do
was
recognize
that
some
of
the
very
issues
that
were
decided
here
were
decided
in
whitney
and
if
you
go
back
and
read
whitney
again,
so
you
think
--
may
think
of
it
as
a
discarded
decision.
but
the
very
same
claim
of
vagueness
that
is
raised
here
and
which
was
the
foundation
for
the
judgment
below
was
discussed
at
very
great
length
in
whitney
and
that
there
was
no
division
in
the
court
on
that
question
--
holmes
--
justices
holmes
and
brandeis
had
no
concern
about
the
vagueness
aspect
of
it.
they
didn't
it
was
vague.
and
indeed,
the
only
problem
they
saw
in
the
case
was
that
the
defendant
had
not
--
should've
not
an
opportunity
to
show
that
there
was
no
clear
and
present
danger
arising
from
her
particular
conduct.
and
they
felt
there
was
evidence
that
would
show
there
was
such
clear
and
present
danger.
that
is
the
--
of
some
eminence
of
violence
as
i
recall
and
so
they
joined
in
the
opinion
affirming
the
validity
of
the
california
criminal
syndicalism
act
or
it
has
not
been
backed
before
the
united
states
supreme
court
since
that.
and
it
would
be
naive
to
suggest
that
their
thinking
about
the
first
amendment
and
about
statute
hasn't
changed
somewhat.
although,
the
same
test
--
the
same
test
that
you
used
over
and
over
again
from
the
--
it's
the
connolly
decision
about
that
people
shouldn't
have
to
guess
it
at
the
meaning
of
words.
that
test
was
used
in
whitney
and
(inaudible)
basically
still
the
same
test.
all
right,
nevertheless,
there
has
been
a
certainly
of
some
changes
in
the
approach
and
in
the
thinking.
well,
this
was
recognized
in
california,
it
was
recognized
no
less
than
in
1946,
in
the
danskin
case.
a
case
which
construed
the
criminal
syndicalism
act
in
the
light
of
changes
in
the
laws
since
whitney
had
been
decided.
chief
justice
treanor
who
was
then
an
associate
justice
recognized
specifically
that
there
has
been
a
lot
happening
since
whitney
was
decided
and
we
got
look
at
this
again
in
light
of
what
is
happened
since
then
and
he
did.
and
he
--
it's
a
long
opinion
and
it
discusses
i
think
all
of
the
cases
that
had
intervened
and
all
of
the
concerns
that
this
court
has
manifested
over
the
years
with
the
need
for
protecting
free
speech
and
drawing
the
line
between
free
speech
and
illegal
advocacy.
and
he
even
in
that
opinion
announced
the
test
which
is
even
stricter
than
your
own
dennis
test.
he
said
that
the
danger
arose
by
the
speech
had
to
be
eminent
and
the
danger
had
to
be
a
danger
that
the
state
could
properly
prohibit.
and
let
me
remind
you
again
that
the
--
what
is
prohibited
here
was
the
advocacy
of
means
unlawful
acts,
criminal
acts,
violent
acts.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that
is
the
danskin
decision
your
honor.
danskin
versus
san
diego
unified
school
district
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes
sir,
that's
it.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
now,
it
might
be
i
suggested
that
this
was
not
a
criminal
prosecution
under
the
criminal
syndicalism
act.
what
is
was,
was
a
case
reviewing
the
action
of
a
local
school
board
in
applying
the
civic
center
act
in
california.
that
act
required
a
loyal
deal
in
effect
if
you
want
to
use
a
school
room
to
hold
a
meeting
and
all
that
you
did
not
or
had
not
advocated
the
overthrow
of
the
government.
and
it
was
argued
in
the
state
supreme
court
that
the
--
that
this
civic
center
act
in
its
all
of
its
requirement
was
a
supplement
to
the
criminal
syndicalism
act
and
it
was
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
that
act.
and
so
in
order
to
appraise
that
argument,
justice
treanor
addressed
himself
to
a
criminal
syndicalism
act
what
it
meant
and
what
it
prohibited
and
anybody
who
is
in
any
doubt
about
what
it
prohibits
can
find
in
that
opinion
what
it
does
prohibit.
he
made
it
very
clear
that
it
did
not
prohibit
the
advocacy
of
abstract
doctrines,
the
discussion
of
abstract
theory
was
never
intended
to
do
that
and
it
doesn't
do
that
and
no
one
should
be
in
any
doubt
in
california
about
the
reach
of
the
criminal
syndicalism
law.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
it
does
not
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
we
don't
know
your
honor.
he's
never
been
tried.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
maybe
he
was
not
in
violation
of
the
statute.
i
wouldn't
--
no
one
can
say
at
this
point,
that's
the
purpose
of
the
whole
trial
system.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
but
let
me
if
i
could
just
add
this
about
it.
the
indictments
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
and
i
suppose
we
all
do
and
put
the
best
cast
on
her
activities
in
a
complaint.
the
indictment
did
contain
the
leaflets
that
he
was
handing
out
on
these
occasions.
that
apparently
is
not
part
of
the
record
below.
he
didn't
handle
the
case.
the
district
attorney
handled
it
below.
if
you
explore
the
grand
jury
transcript
which
again
is
not
part
of
the
record
as
i
understand
it
below
and
incidentally
that
is
not
a
secret
document
in
california.
the
defendant
gets
a
copy
of
it
so
everybody
knows
what's
in
it.
what
really
happened
here
and
i'm
not
going
to
say
that
this
--
i'm
not
even
going
to
say
that
this
can
properly
be
prohibited.
i
don't
think
we've
reached
that
point
because
the
statute
wasn't
applied
to
him
and
he
has
the
all
opportunity
at
the
trial
to
explore
all
these
issues.
but
this
whole
incident
occurred
in
april
1966
about
six
months
after
the
great
watts
riots.
it
grew
out
of
the
shooting
and
killing
of
a
man
named
leonard
deadwyler
in
los
angeles.
he
was
a
black
man
and
it
turned
out
he
was
taking
his
pregnant
wife
to
hospital.
some
confusion
of
the
police
officer
and
he
sped
away
as
i
recall
and
the
police
officer
chased
him
and
later
he
corners
him,
stopped
him
and
later
corners
inquest
determined
that
the
officer
approached
the
car
with
a
weapon
being
fearful
of
the
situation.
he
leaned
on
the
door,
the
weapon
went
off
and
killed
mr.
deadwyler.
now,
there
was
great
fear
about
that
in
the
los
angeles
community.
the
district
attorney
felt
reviewing
the
case
that
that
it
was
not
a
cause
for
an
indictment
but
the
people
hadn't
know
what
it
happened
here.
and
a
corner's
inquest
was
held
that
which
all
witness
testified
to
what
happened.
i
don't
want
to
go
into
that
but
they
started
it
and
then
they
had
to
stop
because
it
was
just
too
much
disorder
and
unruly
behavior
so
they
moved
it
from
where
you
would
normally
hold
an
inquest
where
you'd
have
three
or
four
people
to
the
biggest
courtroom
and
of
course
county
courthouse
in
los
angeles
and
that
is
in
some
courtroom.
it's
much
bigger
than
this
room
and
it
holds
several
hundred
people.
the
place
was
completely
embraced
with
the
police.
the
audience
was
about
90%
black,
there
was
some
disruption
when
witnesses
booing
the
witnesses
that
sort
of
thing.
this
was
the
atmosphere
at
that
courthouse.
people
going
in
and
out
several
hundred
just
to
this
room
and
mr.
harris
was
out
there
handing
these
leaflets
out
in
this
setting
and
the
leaflet
--
i'm
not
certainly
would
read
the
whole
thing
but
it
says,
“wanted
for
the
murder
of
leonard
deadwyler,
bova
the
cop.”
and
that
sort
of
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
pardon
me?.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
it's
not
your
honor
i
have
the
indictment
here.
the
gist
of
it
was
that
watts
was
a
great
concentration
preempt,
bova
was
a
guard
and
deadwyler
an
inmate
and
we
have
to
exterminate
them
before
they
exterminate
us.
that
was
the
gist
of
it.
that
was
the
set
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
we
do.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
--
that
is
something
for
the
court
--
the
trial
court
to
determine
and
the
jury
to
determine,
i
think.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that
they
won't
be
convicted
unless
it
rises
to
that
level
of
advocacy.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
excitement
under
the
dennis
case
under
our
own
danskin
case
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
but
that
language
doesn't
stand
alone
your
honor.
that
language
has
been
construed.
it
was
construed
in
danskin,
it
was
construed
if
you
please
almost
50
years
ago
in
the
case
called
people
against
o'malley
that
we
cite
which
was
a
prosecution
under
this
very
section
handing
out
leaflets
and
that
sort
of
thing.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
that
was
a
long
time
ago.
let's
say
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
don't
think
there
are
many
in
the
30's,
the
great
bulk
of
them
i
believe
were
in
the
20's.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
only
know
in
addition
to
this
prosecution
one
other
prosecution
and
that
is
a
group
of
american
nazis
in
san
mateo
county.
we
found
some
things
in
the
course
of
that
investigation
that
we
thought
the
court
might
be
interested
in
and
that
kind
of
those
to
our
brief.
there
of
course
the
terrorism;
the
only
answer
to
terrorism
when
they
burned
our
flag
it's
time
for
violence.
all
of
these
addressed
toward
violence
toward
negroes
and
people
who
in
the
judgment
of
these
people
are
advocating
very
bad
causes.
i
think
your
honor
which
we've
tried
to
point
out
that
there
has
been
a
change
in
our
society.
it
isn't
that
somebody
suddenly
read
the
criminal
syndicalism
act
although
i
think
in
all
honesty
if
you
ask
a
thousand
people
about
in
california
you
wouldn't
get
an
answer
from
over
one
and
two;
maybe
in
the
whole
state.
it
isn't
because
somebody
suddenly
read
it
and
said,
let's
prosecute.
it's
because
the
advocacy
of
what
is
prohibited
here,
the
advocacy
of
bombing,
of
killing
of
these
things
as
means
of
social
changes.
not
generally
of
doing
let's
go
away
with
the
government
one
way
or
the
other.
the
advocacy
we
seen
in
california
and
that
this
statute
is
directed
to
is
the
advocacy
of
bombing,
the
advocacy
of
shooting,
killing
the
police,
specific
advocacy
of
specific
acts
and
this
renewal
of
this
kind
of
activity
maybe
this
is
not
what
happened
in
the
20's
or
the
turn
of
the
century
but
it's
said
that
that
sort
of
thing
happened
then
with
the
anarchist
and
syndicalist.
we
see
the
same
thing
again
happening
in
california
and
elsewhere
and
this
statute
has
suddenly
again
become
in
one
of
the
favorite
words
of
some
people,
are
they
relevant?
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
--
maybe
it
wasn't
for
a
long
time
but
it
is
not.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
correct.
well,
that's
correct
your
honor.
the
advocacy
of
violence
and
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
i
have
to
defend
the
statute
as
it's
written
and
i
do
defend
those
words.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
i
think
you
have
to
read
those
words
in
light
of
the
way
they've
been
construed.
not
as
if
i
made
them
up
here,
advocates
has
been
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
--
over
and
over
again.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
commission
of?
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
you
mean
in
aiding
and
abetting
the
commission
of?
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
is
it
the
aiding
and
the
abetting?
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
alright,
i
think
this
is
our
position
your
honor
that
advocating
and
teaching
of
the
keywords
and
their
words
of
art
and
aiding
and
abetting
is
the
customary
expression
in
california
to
define
an
accomplished
principle
in
a
second
class.
and
it's
not
even
written
in
the
most
statutes,
committing
murder
is
proscribed
but
if
you
aid
and
abet
the
commission
of
murder,
you're
punishable
as
principle
for
a
murder.
we
say
those
words
are
used
here
in
connection
with
advocating
and
teaching
and
that
refer
to
a
subsidiary
role
in
this
activity
with
guilty
knowledge
and
so
forth
just
as
if
for
any
other
crime.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
i
think
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
as
those
words
are
understood
by
all
of
us
and
have
been
explained
by
this
court
many,
many
times.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
and
by
the
california
courts.
i
think
i
have
to
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
it
was
in
1946
--
june
1946.
some
years
before
dennis
of
course
and
there
hasn't
been
anything
really
since
because
there
hasn't
been
any
prosecution.
this
case
had
been
tried
in
the
state
courts
and
appealed
what
are
presented
these
issues.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
only
one
is
prosecuted
under
the
one
that
prohibits
spreading
and
circulating,
distributing,
written
matter.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
exactly.
there
is
been
expressed
severability
clause
in
the
statute
and
for
there
are
cases
and
we
have
alluded
to
them
in
our
brief
holding
that
these
do
define
separate
crimes.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
everything,
every
part
of
it,
every
word
in
it
and
every
application
of
it.
thank
you.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
only
like
to
suggest
this
that
anybody
who
has
lived
in
california
and
reads
about
california
and
the
things
that
there
is
any
chilling
of
free
speech
and
it
was
free
expression
of
ideas
and
the
teaching
of
almost
anything
under
the
sun
with
all
due
respect
to
anyone
who
believes
that
i
have
to
say
i
can't
believe
it.
we
have
the,
i
think
the
broadest
free
speech
in
california
in
any
place
i
know.
fifty
years
ago,
the
district
court
of
appeal
in
maley
(ph)
and
i
think
it
was
the
district
court
held
that
it
wasn't
enough
to
just
talk
about
revolution
or
something,
you
had
to
have
the
intent
to
bring
about
what
should
the
illegal
means
that
you
were
advocating.
in
danskin
it
was
made
very
clear
that
this
statute
had
nothing
to
do
with
abstract
theories
and
that
would
suggest
that
anybody
is
afraid
to
talk
about
karl
marx
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
--
because
the
statute
is
just
isn't
true.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
sir.
yes,
i
am
your
honor.
i
think
it
is.
i
think
he
felt
he
had
to
reach
that
and
i
don't
think
that
this
statute
should
fall
because
of
some
debate
about
whether
it
was
if
there
were
holding
under
that
particular
situation.
i
think
it's
very
clear
from
the
opinion
even
if
it
weren't
clear
your
honor
i
would
suggest
that
this
court
has
a
duty
to
construe
the
statute
in
light
of
your
own
decisions.
that
regard
to
what
california
has
decided.
and
you
decided
dennis
and
scales
and
yates
and
these
words
are
not
new
and
you
get
them
very
limited
meanings
and
i
think
you
have
a
duty
to
construe
them
in
order
to
sustain
the
statute
and
not
an
order
to
destroy
it.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
that
certainly
what
it
did
here.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
it's
a
matter
so
much
of
application
of
the
statute.
that's,
i
think
what's
you're
suggesting
in
ruling
on
the
various
applications
that
might
be
made
that
you
can
make
soundly
you
can
make
other
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
that's
quite
is
too
vague
any
how
even
if
--
that's
a
little
different
concept.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
they
say
--
they
make
both
contentions
and
it
was
so
held
below.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
district
court
has
a
duty
to
construe
those
words.
they
don't
just
read
them
as
if
you
never
seen
them
at
all.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
no
but
no
--
they
are
the
state
court
and
i
don't
think
they
should
in
that
sense
try
to
be
one
but
no
lawyer
that
i
know
of
picks
up
a
statute
and
looks
at
it
and
says,
“well,
here's
the
word
“teach.”
so,
it's
going
to
have
something
to
do
with
teaching
in
a
classroom.”
none
of
these
construes
statutes
like
that.
first
thing
we
do
is
look
at
the
statute.
we
start
to
look
at
the
cases
and
i
suggest
what
the
district
court
didn't
do.
here,
had
it
done
that
i
think
i
would've
concluded
that
as
construed
and
as
narrowed
in
the
state
construction
this
statute
is
perfectly
valid.
i
say
it's
a
valid
on
its
face
as
has
been
construed.
but
even
if
you
weren't
satisfied
and
you
thought
danskin
was
devoted
to
something
else
and
the
other
cases
are
old
and
so
forth,
still
and
all
i
think
that
court
has
a
duty
to
construe
the
statute
to
uphold
it
and
not
to
strike
it
down.
and
this
court
said
so
in
fox
against
washington.
and
these
are
words,
we
may
use
the
same
words
that
you've
upheld
time
and
time
and
time
again.
and
now,
i
think
to
turn
around,
you
can
say
the
two
vague
or
overbroad
we
don't
understand
them
would
be
contrary
to
your
own
decisions
absolutely
unnecessary
for
the
protection
of
anybody's
rules.
thank
you.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
an
order
of
the
three-judge
court
in
the
central
district
in
california
declaring
the
california
criminal
syndicalism
act
unconstitutional
on
its
face
and
then
all
of
its
parts.
in
enjoining
the
district
attorney
of
los
angeles
county
from
enforcing
and
continuing
the
prosecution
of
a
man
named
john
harris,
jr.
who
was
one
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
the
appeal
is
brought
to
district
attorney
and
represented
here
by
the
attorney
general
of
california.
the
complaint
in
the
district
court
was
filed
by
john
harris,
jr.
following
his
indictment
upon
two
counts
of
violating
subsection
3
of
the
syndicalism
act.
he
claimed
in
the
complaint
by
reason
of
his
prosecution
and
the
presence
of
the
act.
he
was
inhibited
in
the
exercise
of
his
first
amendment
rights.
there
were
three
other
plaintiffs
who
joined
in
the
lawsuit,
jim
dan
and
hirsch
both
alleged
that
they
were
members
of
the
progressive
labor
party,
a
party
that
advocated
political
and
industrial
change
and
they
felt
inhibited
in
attempting
through
peaceful
and
non-violent
means
to
advocate
progressive
labor
party
programs
in
light
of
the
presence
of
the
statute
in
the
prosecution
of
john
harris.
the
fourth
plaintiff
was
a
man
named
broslawsky
who
alleged
that
he
was
a
teacher
of
history
and
he
taught
subjects
in
which
marxism
wasn't
involved
and
he
was
uncertain
what
he
could
say
about
these
matters
by
reason
of
the
presence
of
the
act
on
the
books
and
by
reason
to
prosecution
of
john
harris.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
at
a
state
college
--
san
fernando
state
college,
i
believe.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
the
plaintiffs
alleged
that
there
was
irreparable
injury.
he
alleged
no
specific
facts
in
support
of
this
claim
except
the
conclusion
that
they
felt
inhibited
and
were
prevented
from
exercising
fundamental
constitutional
rights.
the
district
court
held
that
it
had
jurisdiction
to
pass
on
all
phases
of
the
act
not
only
the
section
under
which
john
harris
was
prosecuted.
it
held
that
it
should
not
abstain
in
light
of
dombrowski
and
zwickler
against
koota.
the
district
court
went
on
to
hold
the
act
unconstitutional
on
its
face
and
all
of
its
provisions
were
no
mention
whatever
of
any
california
case
which
it
--
that
it
construed
any
of
the
sections
of
the
act.
finally,
the
court
issued
an
injunction
against
the
pending
prosecution
of
john
harris.
the
appellant
submits
here
that
the
district
court
had
no
jurisdiction
whatever
in
respect
to
the
claims
of
dan,
hirsch,
and
broslawsky
that
is
the
three
plaintiffs
who
have
not
been
indicted.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
there
is
no
such
allegation
your
honor
in
the
complaint
and
in
fact
the
district
court
said
in
the
opinion
that
it
did
not
believe
that
the
plaintiffs
stood
in
any
danger
or
whatever
of
prosecution
for
the
conduct
that
they
alleged,
that
they
had
engaged
in.
in
addition,
in
connection
with
the
jurisdictional
question
we
contend
that
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction
to
pass
on
a
ninth
provision
except
section
3.
the
section
under
which
john
harris
was
charged
and
upon
which
he
was
awaiting
trial.
secondly,
as
to
section
3,
the
district
court
should
have
abstained.
third,
on
the
merits
we
submit
that
the
act
is
valid
in
light
of
a
narrowing
state
constructions
and
a
number
of
state
cases
that
we
cited
in
our
brief.
finally,
all
of
the
things
fail
and
we
submit
that
an
injunction
was
barred
under
section
2283
of
title
28
and
that
there
was
no
irreparable
injury
in
support
of
the
injunctive
relief.
first
point
in
connection
with
the
lack
of
jurisdiction
in
respect
of
the
three
plaintiffs
other
than
john
harris
is
basically
on
the
proposition
that
there
were
no
overt
acts
by
the
state
of
california
or
any
representative
of
the
state
that
might
be
construed
in
any
way
to
have
inhibited
these
plaintiffs
in
the
exercise
of
federal
constitutional
rights.
there
had
been
no
arrest.
there
had
been
no
threat
of
arrest,
no
searches,
no
denunciation
of
these
plaintiffs.
the
only
claim
that
they
can
make
is
that
the
mere
presence
of
the
act
is
sufficient
to
create
a
case
or
controversy.
we
submit
that
it
is
not
and
we
submit
that
under
the
circumstances
here
the
action
of
the
district
court
amounted
to
an
advisory
opinion
on
an
abstract
question.
the
facts
are
set
forth
in
the
complaint
in
connection
with
these
three
plaintiffs
who
were
not
charged
do
not
show
any
substantial
controversy
between
parties
having
adverse
legal
interest
of
sufficient
immediacy
and
reality
to
warrant
declaratory
relief
and
to
give
right
to
a
case
or
controversy.
we
relied
principally
in
that
connection
upon
your
decision
last
term
in
golden
against
zwickler
or
he
dismissed
the
case
because
of
no
case
or
controversy
even
though
having
included
that
the
statute
was
arguably
overbroad
and
affecting
rights
on
the
first
amendment.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
for
four
years
or
thereabouts,
your
honor.
in
connection
with
harris
himself,
we
wouldn't
argue
that
there
is
only
an
abstract
question
--
he's
under
indictment
and
if
the
trial
has
ever
held
could
possibly
be
convicted,
but
he's
only
charged
under
section
3
of
the
act.
we
submit
that
the
district
court
had
no
jurisdiction
to
reach
to
other
sections
of
the
act.
there
are
five
sections
in
section
11401
that
deal
with
different
forms
of
conduct
and
declare
them
illegal
under
the
general
definition
of
criminal
syndicalism
contained
in
section
11400.
the
legislature
provided
in
connection
with
this
act
that
if
any
portion
of
it
for
example
section
3
which
relates
to
the
distributing
of
handbills
and
alike,
printing
matters
and
things
of
that
kind.
that
if
any
part
should
be
held
unconstitutional,
the
rest
remaining
portions
should
be
sustained.
we
have
argued
in
our
brief
that
in
the
smith
act
cases
and
the
smith
act
had
a
structure
very
similar
to
this
with
membership
provision,
with
a
printing
or
distributing
section,
in
those
cases.
this
court
took
each
section
and
examined
that
section
and
declined
to
pass
on
other
sections
only
the
section
that
was
specifically
involved
and
had
been
invoked
against
the
particular
defendants
there
are
dennis,
and
the
yates
case
and
in
the
scales
case.
we
think
that
one
of
the
problems
in
this
case
is
that
the
district
court
in
passing
upon
sections
of
the
act
that
have
not
been
invoked
or
sections
of
the
act
as
to
which
there
was
no
actual
controversy.
for
example,
section
4
is
a
membership
clause
provision.
it
prohibits
organizing.
it
prohibits
knowingly
becoming
a
member
of
a
criminal
syndicalist
organization
as
defined
therein.
this
was
struck
down
by
the
district
court.
harris
was
not
prosecuted
under
this
section.
there
was
no
contention
by
the
district
attorney
nor
has
there
been
any
contention
by
anyone
in
california
that
the
group
to
which
harris
belongs,
the
progressive
labor
party
i
believe,
is
a
proscribe
organization
or
that
belonging
to
it
there
constitutes
any
crime.
in
short,
there
was
no
actual
controversy
on
that
question.
and
we
think
one
of
the
problems
without
--
when
you
don't
have
an
actual
controversy
and
this
case
may
illustrate
that
is
it
there
is
not
an
informed
judgment
passed
by
the
district
court
--
the
pertinent
cases
and
we
cited
some
of
the
cases.
apparently,
we're
never
considered
by
the
court
and
we
think
this
was
due
probably
because
of
the
district
attorney
was
not
interested
in
the
membership
clause.
he
was
not
prosecuting.
harris
had
not
been
charged
under
the
membership
clause
and
he
was
interested
only
in
an
abstract
way
in
the
validity
of
that
section.
we
submit
that
the
decision
here
is
concrete
proof
of
what
happens
when
a
court
goes
ahead
and
in
effect
issues
an
advisory
opinion.
there
isn't
enough
interest
in
the
case
apparently
to
give
the
informed
judgment
that
constitutional
adjudication
that
we
submit
calls
for.
now,
in
connection
with
section
3,
with
the
only
section
we
feel
was
properly
before
the
district
court.
we
think
the
district
court
should
have
abstained
with
three
reasons
why
we
believe
this
to
be
true.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
section
3,
yes
justice
brennan.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
i
will.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes
it
has
--
it
has
been
construe.
we
think
the
court
should've
abstained
for
three
reasons
even
though
we
don't
argue
jurisdiction
as
to
subsection
3
in
connection
with
john
harris.
in
the
first
place,
this
law
was
acceptable
of
a
narrowing
interpretation
that
would
by
resolving
vagueness
in
the
terms
of
the
statute
show
any
problem
of
overbreadth.
and
thus,
we
submit
there
was
a
reasonable
expectation
that
there
would
no
necessity
to
adjudicate
the
constitutional
limits
of
the
states
legislation
in
this
field.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
circulating
actually,
two
handbills
in
the
course
of
a
corner's
inquest
in
los
angeles.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
the
handbills
are
set
forth
in
an
appendix
filed
by
the
petitioner
--
the
appellees
here
and
in
essence
it
was
directed
to
--
well,
we
have
to
give
a
little
bit
of
background.
this
event
occurred
in
may
of
1966,
the
inquest.
this
was
some
six
months
--
eight
months
after
the
watts
riots
in
los
angeles
county.
the
inquest
concerns
the
death
of
a
man
named
leonard
deadwyler
who
had
been
shot
by
a
police
officer,
stopping
him
believing
he
was
driving
on
the
influence
of
intoxicating
liquors.
and
accidentally,
a
gun
was
discharged
and
the
--
mr.
deadwyler
was
dead.
the
officer
was
named
bova.
the
first
of
the
handbills
that
are
set
forth
and
attached
to
the
indictment
refers
to
bova
the
cop.
it
says,
“wanted
for
the
murder
of
leonard
deadwyler”.
the
statement
is
made
“they”
referring
to
the
police
department
must
all
be
wipeout
before
there

freedom.
south
los
angeles
watts
is
one
big
concentration
camp
and
so
forth,
that
goes
on
for
two
or
three
pages.
this
is
in
the
appendix
to
the
appellee's
supplemental
brief
on
reargument.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
those
are
illustrative
matter.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
that's
from
the
black
panther
paper
in
san
francisco.
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
--
with
the
facts
of
this
particular
case.
those
are
illustrative
of
the
conditions
that
we
submitted
at
that
time
warranted
to
the
upholding
of
this
act.
in
connection
with
the
question
of
abstention,
we
say
the
state
law
can
be
saved
and
if
it
can
be
saved
is
will
avoid
a
constitutional
decision
by
the
federal
courts
be
at
the
district
court
or
this
court.
and
that's
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
doctrine.
there
is
a
pending
vehicle
in
the
indictment
of
john
harris
and
if
he's
ever
tried
the
trial
and
his
appeal.
finally,
there's
no
evidence
whatever
and
nor
is
that
even
claimed
that
there
has
been
bad-faith
enforcements
of
the
statute
for
the
purpose
of
denying
the
people
of
california
their
federal
constitutional
rights.
there
is
a
contention
that
many
years
ago,
this
may
have
occurred
but
there
is
no
contention
that
at
or
about
that
time
this
case
was
filed
and
decided
in
los
angeles.
there
was
any
bad
faith
enforcement
of
the
act.
we
say
that
this
act
is
susceptible
to
a
clarifying
and
a
narrowing
construction
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first
of
all
there
been
a
number
of
cases
in
california
that
have
passed
on
various
provisions
of
the
act
since
it
was
enacted
in
1919.
the
great
flurry
of
prosecutions
arose
that
between
1919
and
1924
and
there
has
been
very
little
only
in
this
case
having
reached
any
kind
of
appellate
statute
since
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
it's
a
blue
cover
mr.
brennan
and
it's
an
appendix
to
that
supplemental
brief.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
it's
filed
by
the
appellees
not
by
the
appellant.
the
decision
over
20
years
ago
in
the
danskin
case
by
justice
traynor
made
a
very
clear
that
in
the
view
of
california
supreme
court
--
the
california
criminal
syndicalism
act
couldn't
be
evaluated
simply
on
its
face
and
in
its
own
terms.
but
it
had
to
be
evaluated
in
light
of
decisions
by
this
court
in
the
area
for
the
first
amendment.
in
fact,
justice
traynor
said
that
the
act
could
only
be
applied
to
prohibit
conduct
where
there
was
imminent
danger
but
advocacy
will
give
rise
to
the
evils
that
the
state
may
properly
prevent.
that
is
language
that
is
very
reminiscent
and
it's
very
close
to
the
language
by
this
court
in
the
brandenburg
case
last
term
when
you
struck
down
the
ohio
criminal
syndicalism
law
on
the
ground
that
it
was
not
limited
to
speech
or
advocacy
directed
to
inciting
violent
action,
and
it
contained
no
conditions
that
such
action
be
likely
under
the
circumstances.
we
submit
that
a
fair
reading
of
danskin
gives
a
very
close
parallel
with
your
decision
in
brandenburg
and
you
can
reasonably
anticipate
that
the
california
supreme
court
if
it
sustains
the
law
at
all
would
sustain
it
under
that
kind
of
a
clarifying
and
narrowing
construction.
now,
in
connection
with
section
3
itself,
the
so-called
circulating
or
distributing
search
in
the
o'malley
case
which
the
people
against
o'malley
which
is
cited
in
our
briefs.
the
state
court
many
years
ago
in
anticipation
of
many
of
the
doctrines
that
have
developed
held
that
to
prosecute
and
convict
a
person
under
this
section
it
had
to
be
proven
that
he
understood
the
doctrines
in
the
material
and
the
handbills
that
he
was
handing
out.
that
he
wasn't
just
out
there
handing
out
something
because
somebody
told
him
to.
he
had
to
understand
it
and
he
had
to
intend
to
bring
about
the
consequences
that
is
the
unlawful
acts,
the
unlawful
means,
terroristic
means
that
are
proscribed
under
the
statute.
he
had
to
have
to
intent
himself
to
do
that
and
in
addition
there
had
to
be
a
clear
and
present
danger
of
such
unlawful
acts
necessary.
this
is
very
close
we
submit
to
what
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
held
in
the
intervening
years
in
the
dennis
case
and
many
other
cases.
look
into
new
york
to
anticipate
state
court
action
in
the
epton
case.
they
said
the
criminal
anarchy
statute
there
was
given
a
narrow
construction.
look
into
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
this
field
the
smith
act
cases.
all
that
gave
a
clarifying
and
narrowing
construction
to
those
sections
the
dennis,
yates,
and
scales
decisions
and
they
each
--
each
of
those
cases
finds
its
parallel
in
one
of
the
provisions
in
the
criminal
syndicalism
act.
this
is
my
case
such
as
baggett
--
the
baggett
case,
zwickler
case,
zwickler
against
koota.
what
the
court
felt
that
there
was
no
chance
of
the
statute
could
be
saved
but
in
effect
an
expression
but
it
could
not
be
saved
by
narrowing
construction.
in
fact
we
think
this
is
a
classic
example
of
the
other
extreme.
a
case
that
can
and
i
would,
in
speaking
of
the
probabilities
which
i
suppose
were
concerned
with
it
in
this
issue.
the
odds
are
certainly
very
heavy
that
this
statute
can
be
saved
and
that
it
would
be
saved
by
the
california
courts
if
ever
presented
to
them.
now,
there
is
a
case
at
the
moment
and
that
is
the
prosecution
of
john
harris.
if
he
is
found
guilty
and
since
he
has
absolute
right
to
appeal
his
conviction
and
have
the
validity
of
the
conviction
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
the
indictment
is
a
typical
indictment
in
california.
california
indictments
are
in
the
language
of
the
statute
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
in
the
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
it's
not
reprinted
but
it
is
charged
with
having
as
accuse
of
having
violated
this
particular
section
114013
of
the
penal
code.
then,
it
goes
on
to
say
that
on
or
about
the
certain
date
he
did
willfully,
unlawfully
and
feloniously
issue
circulate
and
so
forth
certain
papers
and
forms
that
contained
written
and
printed
advocacy
of
in
effect
criminal
syndicalism.
advocating
terrorism
and
advising
the
commission
of
crime
etcetera.
it's
really
lengthy
because
the
statute
itself
is
rather
lengthy.
and
in
addition
attached
to
the
indictment
is
the
specific
handbill
he
handed
out
on
each
occasion.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
good.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
the
indictment
starts
at
page
3
of
this
appendix
and
it
runs
for
quite
a
number
of
pages
because
there
were
two
different
days,
two
different
handbills
and
two
different
counts
in
this
indictment.
it
should
--
the
indictment
should
be
read
in
light
of
the
california
procedure
wherein
the
defendant
has
made
available
to
him
the
grand
jury
transcript
automatically
without
any
question
asked
so
that
to
charge
him
simply
in
the
language
of
the
statute
doesn't
prejudice
him.
he
confined
exactly
what
the
evidence
was
and
pinpoint
the
charge.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
we
submit
your
honor
that
under
the
standard
california
procedure,
the
first
opportunity
in
the
trial
court
would
be
when
instructions
are
given
to
the
jury.
now,
the
question
might
arise
in
connection
with
evidence
as
it's
offered
but
by
at
large,
i
would
think
it
would
be
--
the
elements
would
be
set
forth
in
the
instructions
to
the
jury.
the
conditions,
the
things
that
jury
has
to
find
in
order
to
convict
this
man.
now,
it's
been
contended
here
that
the
harris
moved
under
995
of
the
penal
code
to
dismiss
the
indictment,
that
motion
was
denied.
he
demurred
to
the
indictment
on
the
ground
that
the
statute
upon
which
the
indictment
was
founded
was
void
on
its
face.
the
demur
was
denied.
the
motion
under
995
was
denied.
now,
those
are
simply
trial
court
rulings.
the
harris
then
applied
to
a
district
court
of
appeals
under
section
999
(a)
of
the
penal
code.
now,
this
is
special
california
procedure.
under
995,
you
can
attack
an
indictment
on
the
grounds
either
that
the
indictment
was
unlawfully
returned
something
some
error
occurred
in
the
process
or
in
the
ground
is
not
probable
cause
to
hold
the
defendant
to
answer.
and
this
turns
on
the
evidence
before
the
grand
jury,
it's
an
evidentiary
issue.
now,
if
this
is
denied,
california
has
a
special
statutory
procedure
999
(a)
and
i
don't
know
of
anything
similar
in
federal
practice
and
it's
a
very
good
provision
whereby
you
can
go
to
the
appellate
court,
the
intermediate
appellate
court
and
asked
for
a
writ
of
prohibition
under
the
section
on
the
ground
that
you're
being
held
without
probable
cause
and
you
shouldn't
put
all
the
trouble
of
the
trial.
999
(a)
however,
is
limited
to
this
issue
whether
or
not
the
defendant
is
being
held
without
probable
cause.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
that's
correct
your
honor.
that
is
the
only
issue
that
may
properly
be
raised
under
the
special
statutory
writ.
now,
the
question
of
whether
the
statute
is
itself
valid
on
its
face
and
similar
question
can't
be
raised
at
that
point.
this
is
simply
to
determine
should
the
man
be
held
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
i
think
we
don't
have
any
present
as
to
precisely
what
would
happen
under
those
circumstances
your
honor,
but
i
think
clear
and
present
danger
is
one
of
those
elements
that
would
be
tested
at
the
trial
as
oppose
to
the
grand
jury
indictment.
the
grand
jury
indictment
is
just
put
the
man
to
trial
not
to
convict
him
and
there
is
an
evidence
in
this
transcript
which
would
indicate
the
clear
and
present
danger.
but,
i
don't
think
that
under
our
procedure
it's
called
for
that
particular
time.
now,
it's
been
argued
that
the
application
for
999
(a)
relief
which
was
denied
and
then
a
petition
for
hearing
to
the
california
supreme
court
was
denied.
it's
been
claimed
by
the
appellees
that
this
in
effect
gave
the
state
court
a
chance
to
limit
the
statute
in
its
application
and
they
didn't
take
that
chance.
we
don't
think
that
is
a
sound
argument
for
the
reasons
i've
mentioned.
999
(a)
does
not
embrace
that
question
of
this
kind.
it
embraces
only
the
question
evidentiary
question.
secondly,
there
are
considerations
in
any
pretrial
motion
of
this
kind
in
addition
to
the
legal
question
that
is
presented.
there
is
a
question
of
whether
you
should
disrupt
the
criminal
trial
or
whether
you
should
not
whether
you
should
let
him
proceed.
the
application
of
the
state
supreme
court
is
like
the
application
to
this
court
for
certiorari
so
probably
discretionary.
and
we
don't
think
this
issue
has
been
properly
presented
to
the
california
courts.
we're
confident
that
when
it
is,
the
statute
will
be
limited
and
brought
within
constitutional
limitations.
the
place
in
california
procedure
where
this
should
really
be
accomplished
is
in
the
jury
instructions
and
then
if
those
are
not
adequate
in
the
event
that
harris
is
convicted
of
course.
possibility
is
he
may
not
be.
if
he
is
convicted
there
can
be
a
review
on
a
full
record
of
the
instructions
as
applied
under
the
evidence
in
light
of
the
statute
and
all
of
their
controlling
cases
--
not
a
simple
question,
a
complex
question.
we
think
that
that
is
the
time
for
review
and
think
it
will
not
prejudice
john
harris
to
wait
that
time
for
review
of
the
interest
which
he
is
concerned.
and
that
is
whether
he's
going
to
be
held
guilty
of
violating
subsection
3.
certainly,
the
trial
court
in
passing
on
a
demur
that
was
--
it
was
no
authority
of
interpretation
by
the
state
courts
of
this
section
of
the
criminal
syndicalism
act.
now,
there
are
procedures
available
in
california
that
perhaps
could
secure
a
ruling
pretrial
on
this
question.
they
were
not
invoked
here,
habeas
corpus
might
lie.
a
rare
prohibition
in
the
sense
of
the
normal
extraordinary
writ
not
the
special
statutory
999
(a)
might
possibly
lie
in
this
situation.
these
things
were
not
done.
these
were
the
cases
that
are
referred
to
in
the
briefs
filed
by
the
appellees
as
showing
this
opportunity
given
to
the
state
courts.
i'd
like
to
save
any
time
that
i
have
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
four
minutes
your
honor.
i
didn't
get
to
the
last
two
points
in
opening
remarks
was
the
time
of
problem.
i
didn't
mean
to
waive
any
point
in
connection
with
either
the
merits
of
the
act
or
the
impact
of
section
2283
which
we
set
forth
a
very
considerable
length
in
our
brief.
we
think
it
barred
the
injunction
here
in
looking
at
the
complaint
which
is
--
appears
in
the
appendix
and
on
at
page
7
it
is
quite
apparent
to
me
that
a
permanent
injunction
was
prayed
for
a
temporary
restraining
order
and
a
preliminary
injunction
in
fact
were
all
prayed
for
by
the
plaintiff
john
harris
and
by
the
other
plaintiffs
here.
we
are
--
we
still
urge
and
i
think
if
you
examine
the
cases
that
have
been
cited
by
the
appellees
that
the
999
(a)
procedure
does
not
permit
the
raising
of
the
constitutional
question
that
they
presented
here.
the
argued
it
but
they
didn't
do
it
within
a
procedural
framework.
they
would
permit
the
state
courts
to
decide
it.
we
also
submit
that
however,
whatever
our
view
might
be
or
whatever
the
district
court's
understanding
might
be
of
the
procedural
niceties
in
california
shouldn't
be
determinative
of
this
case.
the
2283
still
bars
an
injunction
without
any
regard
to
what
interlocutory
procedures
are
provided
for
in
california.
and
as
far
as
the
declaratory
judgment
is
concerned,
we
urged
that
the
statute
can
properly
be
save
and
under
what
is
clear
this
is
a
consideration
that
should've
prompt
the
district
court
to
abstain
and
let
the
statute
be
thrash
out
in
the
state
courts
and
let
john
harris
have
his
remedy
and
i
think
there
can
be
no
real
doubt
that
he
has
a
real
and
meaningful
remedy
within
the
california
courts.
only
a
week
ago,
monday,
this
court
in
o'leary
against
schneider
number
1225
affirm
per
curiam
a
case
out
of
louisiana
where
the
federal
district
court
have
abstained
from
getting
into
a
louisiana
prosecution.
and
there,
there
had
been
an
application
to
the
louisiana
courts,
in
fact,
an
application
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court
for
relief
by
the
defendant
during
the
course
of
his
application
to
the
federal
court.
this
was
not
deemed
to
be
of
any
great
consequence
under
their
particular
situation
and
we
think
it
is
somewhat
comparable
with
the
situation
here.
now,
what
the
procedural
niceties
are
in
louisiana,
i
have
no
idea.
and
we
don't
think
that
that
this
case
should
turn
on
that.
2283
clearly
barred
the
injunction,
the
statute
can
be
salvaged
and
so
far
as
harris
is
concerned
and
certainly
no
more
than
the
one
prosecution
that
he
is
facing.
there
is
no
--
i
think
the
delay
here
is
mentioned
in
a
question
has
been
very
considerable.
now,
the
case
proceeded
in
the
state
courts
and
no
doubt
it
would
have
been
terminated
long
sentence
and
we
stand
here
four
years
with
the
state
of
california
in
the
situation
of
been
unable
to
proceed
against
john
harris
whatever
the
merits
of
that
case
might
be,
and
more
importantly
unable
to
proceed
within
the
constitutional
limits
of
the
criminal
syndicalism
act.
it's
not
a
question
of
zealous
prosecution.
it's
a
question
of
enforcing
the
law
within
the
proper
constitutional
limits
that
this
court
has
laid
down
and
it
certainly
suggest
in
brandenburg
that
within
the
criminal
syndicalism
act
there
is
an
area
within
which
the
state
may
properly
act
or
prohibit
the
advocacy
of
criminal
means
whether
it
be
killing
all
cops,
whether
it
be
blowing
up
a
building,
person
or
whatever.
we
think
the
state
should
be
able
to
prove
the
causative
relationship
between
the
advocacy
and
these
criminal
acts.
thank
you.
