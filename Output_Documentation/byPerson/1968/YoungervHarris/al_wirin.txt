mr.
a.l.
wirin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first
to
deal
quickly
as
far
as
i’m
concerned,
as
far
as
my
time
is
concerned,
with
the
question
put
by
justice
stewart
to
mr.
thompson.
in
the
appellee’s
opening
brief
we
cite
a
gross
or
so
of
california
statutes,
which
penalized
not
only
acts
of
violence,
but
threats
of
violence.
and
in
a
brief
which
is
a
gray
colored,
called
appellees
supplemental
brief
on
re-argument
at
page
17
in
a
footnote,
i
think
it
has
been
said
that
the
heart
of
many
of
the
opinions
of
this
court
are
in
footnotes,
but
that’s
not
to
--
and
then
its
necessary
aside,
anyway,
on
page
17
in
the
footnote
which
begins
on
page
60,
and
footnote
17a,
we
cite
a
statute
in
california,
which
makes
it
a
crime
to
incite
to
riot,
there'd
be
no
violence,
there’d
be
no
actual
violence,
merely
an
incitement
to
riot
is
of
--
is
a
crime
in
california,
as
of
course
it
is
many
states.
now
secondly,
with
respect
to
another
issue
which
i
--
will
which
--
i
think
i
can
deal
quickly,
it
be
this
true
as
mr.
thompson
has
stated
your
honors
that
in
the
suit
filed
on
the
district
court
in
california,
there
were
four
plaintiffs,
three
in
addition
to
the
appellee
harris.
as
to
none
of
the
plaintiffs,
with
the
exception
of
harris,
we
admit
there
was
no
direct
threat
of
prosecution.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
one
was
a
history
teacher.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
one
was
a
member
of
the
same
--
of
the
party,
progressive
labor
party
and
--
mr.
a.l.
wirin
yes,
but
in
any
event
your
honor
--
mr.
a.l.
wirin
i
forgot.
in
any
event,
the
order
which
was
made
by
the
district
court,
an
order
of
preliminary
injunction
was
made
only
for
the
benefit
of
and
for
and
with
respect
to
the
appellee
harris.
and
we
think
the
--
now,
we
are
appellees,
we
think
the
--
all
of
the
appellees
except
harris
are
not
proper
appellees
in
this
court
and
we
think
that
your
honors
so
have
said
that
because
no
injunction
--
mr.
a.l.
wirin
that’s
right,
because
no
injunction
was
issued
after
them
and
indeed
no
declaratory
judgment
really
was
issued
because
the
court
hadn’t
taken
jurisdiction
of
the
merits
of
the
case
in
order
to
declare
their
rights,
though
i
will
debate
that
later.
in
any
event,
it
is
our
view
that
under
the
gun
case,
decided
by
your
honors
last
term
and
indeed
as
i
say,
we
said
this
in
our
--
in
one
of
our
briefs
prior
to
your
honors
ruling,
they
are
not
proper
appellees
and
the
question
is
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
judicable
controversy
between
these
other
three
plaintiffs
and
the
appellant
we
think
is
not
an
issue
which
your
honors
need
to
reach
in
which
certainly
we
do
not
press
which
brings
me
to
discuss
the
issues
which
are
before
your
honors
and
that
is;
first,
i
am
going
to
try
to
avoid
before
your
honors
in
this
session
to
repeat
the
argument
i
made
the
last
year
which
was
bottomed
largely
on
the
first
amendment
for
i
realize
now
more
than
i
did
then
that
there
are
issues
before
--
in
this
court
which
need
to
be
resolved
favorable
to
the
appellee
harris
long
before
the
first
amendment
is
reached
by
this
court.
and
this
issues
which
i
must
--
with
respect
to
which
i
must
concede
i
gave
a
kind
of
summary
at
--
consideration
in
my
argument,
namely
the
applicability
of
section
2283
and
the
problem
of
abstention
of
the
core
issues
to
which
i
want
to
address
myself.
i
of
course
recalled
though
justice
brennan,
may
not
since
he
hears
so
many
lawyers
argue,
his
admonition
to
me
that
i
better
reach
the
problem
of
section
2283
before
long
and
then
my
time
ran
out
before
i
gave
it
a
kind
of
attention
which
i
think
i
can
give
it
this
morning.
now,
we
agree
of
course
that
before
we
can
prevail,
i
say
“we”,
i
mean
he,
harris
can
prevail,
we
have
to
successfully
cross
the
threshold
of
2283.
and
we
think
we
have
done
it
for
the
following
reasons
and
incidentally,
i
am
going
to
assume
for
the
purpose
of
my
argument
that
the
exceptions
to
section
2283
are
not
a
broad
charter
of
rights,
the
exceptions,
to
be
narrowly
construed,
i
needn't
say
that
i
have
in
mind
the
decision
of
your
honors'
the
last
term.
we
think
the
injunction
issued
in
this
case
comes
within
the
number
of
a
--
within
the
exceptions
specifically
provided
for
by
congress
in
section
2283.
first,
we
think
that
the
injunction,
preliminary
injunction
in
the
special
circumstances
of
the
posture
of
the
case
as
it
presented
itself
before
the
three-judge
court
below
that
the
injunction
was
in
aid
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
and
to
borrow,
and
to
use,
and
to
accept
the
phrase
of
this
court
was
necessary
in
the
aid
of
that
jurisdiction
and
to
effectuate
its
judgment
and
that
is
because
of
the
following.
the
matter
came
on
before
the
district
court
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
i
misstating
myself,
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint,
on
a
motion
by
the
state
--
mr.
a.l.
wirin
well,
i’m
not
talking
about
that,
i’m
taking
about
the
jurisdiction
and
the
provident
excise
of
jurisdiction
by
the
district
court.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
i
do
and
expect
to
reach
the
problems
in
the
state
court,
if
time
permitting.
but
in
the
federal
court,
the
posture
of
the
case
was,
a
complaint
had
been
filed,
and
they
think
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional,
the
federal
civil
rights
act,
and
the
defendant,
the
appellant
here,
younger
had
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss.
so,
all
that
the
district
court
had
before
it
was
a
motion
to
dismiss,
and
i
say
all,
because
i
mean
it
did
not
have
the
case
before
it
on
the
merits.
the
case
wasn’t
ready
for
an
adjudication
by
way
of
declaratory
judgment
or
otherwise
on
the
merits,
that
motion
to
dismiss.
the
court
determined
to
overrule
the
motion
to
dismiss.
therefore,
the
next
steps
in
the
case
would
be
the
filing
of
the
some
responsive
pleading
by
the
appellant
here,
to
defendant
there.
a
responsive
pleading,
which
was
never
filed,
was
passed
back.
now,
it
is
our
view
that
wholly
aside
from
the
juri
--
from
any
authority
which
the
district
court
had
to
issue
an
injunction,
it
did
have
authority,
particularly
in
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
this
case,
by
way
of
declaratory
judgment
to
pass
upon
the
statute
and
to
determine
whether
on
its
face
it
was
overbroad.
therefore,
it
had
jurisdiction
over
the
cause
and
continued
to
have
jurisdiction
over
the
cause,
until
the
merits
of
the
cause
were
before
the
district
court.
and
until
the
merits
of
the
cause,
namely
whether
or
not
the
court
should
by
way
of
declaratory
judgment,
determine
whether
or
not
the
statute
was
constitutional
on
its
face
until
it
reached
that
point,
the
court
had
authority
under
section
2283
to
issue
interstitial,
pendente
lite,
injunctive
relief,
which
it
did.
so
as
to
maintain
a
jurisdiction
over
the
cause
or
if
no
preliminary
injunction
were
issued,
i’m
assuming
of
course
it
had
jurisdiction
ultimately
by
way
of
declaratory
judgment
to
decide
the
constitution
under
the
statute.
for
the
purpose
of
my
present
argument,
if
no
preliminary
injunction
issued,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court,
thereafter,
after
the
defendant
upon
here
filed
a
responsive
pleading,
to
adjudicate
the
statute
would
have
been
aborted,
would
have
been
mooted,
if
the
proceeding,
setting
aside
the
problem
that
the
statutes,
i’ll
come
to
in
a
moment,
if
the
proceeding
were
allowed
to
go
forward
in
a
state
court.
so
in
order
to
--
in
our
view
to
maintain
a
jurisdiction,
in
order
to
protect
and
effectuate
any
judgment,
i’m
now
paraphrasing
the
language
of
section
2283,
which
judgment
it
had
jurisdiction
to
make
thereafter,
we
think
it
had
authority
to
issue
this
interstitial
preliminary
injunction
until
it
could
reach
the
merits.
moreover,
there
is
the
civil
--
mr.
a.l.
wirin
well,
that
--
you
know
your
honor
that’s
kind
of
a
double-edged
sword,
but
i’ll
take
this
--
i’ll
take
up
a
sword
nonetheless
but
--
mr.
a.l.
wirin
one
at
your
time,
there
was.
in
other
words,
the
--
i
may
have
run
into
the
problems
by
the
abstention.
in
answer
to
your
honor’s
question
i
did,
but
i
do,
that
has
to
say
the
state
said
that
it
would
go
forward
with
the
prosecution,
unless
the
federal
court
issued
an
injunction.
so
that
we
felt
there
was
--
we
felt
--
we
feel
now
there
was
a
necessity
of
some
kind
of
interstitial
injunctive
relief
under
section
2283.
now
additionally,
as
your
honors
know
of
course,
because
of
your
concern
with
this
problem
and
your
--
the
ruling
of
your
honors,
in
the
atlantic
case
last
term,
we
think
you
know
of
course
that
section
2283
in
addition
to
the
exception
which
i’ve
discussed,
also
makes
it
–
tabs
out
of
section
where
there
was
an
act
of
congress.
now
we
think
here,
your
honor,
there
are
two
acts
of
congress.
i
suppose
one
would
be
sufficient
if
it
--
it
was
sufficient.
one
is
the
civil
rights
act,
which
i
do
not
propose
to
argue
in
oral
argument
because
i
know
it
will
be
argued
fully
in
oral
argument
in
the
cases
following,
and
as
in
the
brief
extensively
that
statute
confers
jurisdiction
on
a
federal
court
to
grant
relief
under
federal
civil
rights
act.
at
law,
in
equity,
or
in
any
other
manner
and
i
suppose
injunction
is
equity
and
so
we
think
it’s
an
exception.
moreover,
we
think
it
is
not
accidental,
but
on
the
contrary
it
is
meaningful
that
section
2283,
of
the
28
u.s.
code
follows
section
2281,
just
precedes
section
2284
and
those
sections
expressly
confer
jurisdiction
upon
a
federal
court
to
adjudge
a
state
statue
to
be
unconstitutional
and
to
issue
an
injunction
against
such
statutes,
where
a
federal
court
and
i
say
did,
that
statute
conferred
jurisdiction
on
a
federal
court,
to
hold
a
state
statute
unconstitutional,
to
issue
injunction,
where
that
statute
repugnant
to
the
constitution.
now,
the
purpose
of
this
suit,
the
thrust
of
the
suit
filed
in
the
district
court
was
that
this
statute
was
repugnant
to
the
constitution
because
it’s
violating
the
first
amendment.
and
so,
if
your
honors
won't
accept
before,
exception
which
i’ve
indicated,
i
hope
you’ll
find
one
of
these
exceptions
not
wanting
and
therefore,
there
has
been
a
compliance
with
section
2283.
but
even
if
section
2283
and
as
i
say,
i’m
kind
--
i’m
giving
in
my
argument,
the
exceptions
are
narrow
rather
than
a
broad
or
latitude
in
area
of
liberal
construction.
assuming
we
can
encounter
and
jump
a
hurdle
of
2283,
if
we
can't
we
are
done
so
far
as
the
injunction
is
concerned,
but
we
think
we’re
not
undone,
it
would've
been
a
done
undone
part,
but
didn’t
--
nonetheless,
there
was
the
problem
of
that
abstention
and
i
would
do
a
disservice
to
the
court,
as
well
as
to
mr.
harris,
if
i
stuck
my
hand,
hid
in
the
sand
and
didn’t
recognize
the
importance
of
that
question
and
the
importance
to
which
--
the
importance
which
this
court
has
--
(inaudible)
this
court
has
treated
that
question.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
your
honor,
depends
what
recently
means,
not
this
term,
we
filed
two
briefs,
the
last
term
and
in
that
connection,
if
your
honor
will
permit
me,
i
want
to
say
something
about
the
length
of
this
case
and
i
know
your
honors
will
--
hope
your
honors
will
not
take
umbrageous
what
i
say.
this
case
has
been
in
the
courts
a
long
time,
but
it
has
been
literally
three
years
in
this
court
and
it's
not
a
question
of
placing
blame
on
any
one
but
we
hope
you
won’t
--
i’ll
go
to
say,
take
it
out
on
the
appellee
because
of
the
delay.
there
have
been
delays
in
this
case
due
to
the
fact
that
this
court
has
not
been
complete
and
there
was
also
delay
in
the
district
court,
i
will
concede
because
at
the
time
the
district
court
had
the
matter,
this
court
had
not
yet
decided
brandenburg.
this
court
was
confront
--
the
district
court
was
confronted
with
the
problem,
of
the
kind
of
anticipating
what
the
present
law
was
and
it
ruled
that
whitney
was
no
longer
viable
in
view
of
other
decisions
of
this
court
made
that
ruling
prior
to
brandenburg.
now
i
view
with
the
problem
of
abstention
and
it's
--
and
if
i
may
say
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
in
declaring
or
adjudging
judicial
policy
as
it
does,
can
control
the
improvident
issues
and
issues
of
injunctions
or
even
declaratory
judgments
by
the
district
courts
through
their
judicial
formula
of
abstention
and
that
matter
is
of
course
entirely
in
your
honors'
hands.
now
for
the
purposes
of
my
argument,
i’m
going
to
assume
that
it
is
the
law,
i’m
not
talking
about
abstention
as
distinguished
from
injunction
that
there
should
be
abstention
only
in
unusual
cases
because
i
think
i
--
or
as
i
try
to
recognize
that
under
our
system,
the
federal
district
courts
should
intervene
or
intercede
albeit
the
right
which
are
at
stake
are
in
the
first
amendment
and
hence,
some
consider
the
most
important
of
rights,
not
in
–
certainly
not
in
every
case
and
so
i’m
saying
in
the
unusual
case.
and
if
that
is
the
--
if
that
is
the
proper
standard,
and
i
think
it's
a
narrower
standard
that
this
court
has
been
imposing
on
the
issue
of
abstention.
we
think
it
was
proper
for
the
district
court
in
the
special
circumstances
of
this
case
and
as
i
read
the
decisions
of
this
court,
whenever
this
court
comes
to
grips
with
the
problem
of
abstention,
it
considers
the
special
circumstances
of
the
case.
under
the
special
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
district
court
did
not
abuse
its
discretion,
i
think
it
is
a
matter
of
discretion
subject
of
course
to
review
in
this
court,
to
review
in
this
court
in
retaining
jurisdiction
until
it
had
an
opportunity
to
decide
the
matter
on
the
merits
and
to
determine
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
now,
i
suggest
that
the
following
circumstances
in
this
case
are
the
special
circumstances
which
warranted
the
district
court
in
not
abstaining
in
view
of
the
special
circumstances.
first,
the
statute
involved
here,
i'll
interpret
myself,
i
cannot
see
or
understand
the
argument
of
the
attorney
general
that
the
statute
applies
to
act
unless
the
word
act
encompasses
just
speech.
on
its
face,
the
statute
applies
to
doctrines
and
presets.
as
applied,
it
applies
to
a
person
who
distributed
two
leaflets.
but
passing
that,
it
is
urged
by
the
attorney
general
in
his
briefs
as
it
was
before
your
honors
in
oral
argument
that
the
district
court
should
not
have
attempted
to
pass
upon
provisions
in
the
statute
other
than
those
--
other
than
that
under
which
the
appellee
harris
was
prosecuted.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
implicitly
a
confession
that
this
statute
is
aimed
only
at
speech,
is
not
capable
of
clarification
or
construction
in
one
criminal
prosecution.
and
as
i
understand
the
decisions
of
this
court,
baggett
versus
bullitt
and
the
dissent
in
cameron
versus
johnson,
the
first
cameron
versus
johnson
where
a
statute
which
affects
speech,
it
effects
pure
speech
as
we
say
is
not
capable
of
being
hammered
out
in
one
prosecution.
and
where
it
expects
--
effects
speech
in
contradistinction
to
a
statute
which
effects
conduct,
that’s
the
kind
of
a
statute
with
respect
to
which,
there
may
be
no
abstention
as
there
was
no
abstention
in
baggett
versus
bullitt.
and
i’m
not
going
to
talk
about
dombrowski
because
i
just
i
don’t
know
and
i
suppose
no
human
being
knows
what
a
majority
of
this
court
thinks
about
dombrowski,
except
that
i
think
that
it
is
a
great
decision
and
--
but
my
thoughts
needn't
be
expressed.
incidentally,
there
was
one
matter
with
respect
to
injunction
which
i
didn’t
say
that
i
must
say
that
is
with
--
and
that
is
that
in
connection
with
the
matter
of
the
propriety
of
the
federal
court
issuing
an
injunction,
i
share
the
views
of
justice
harlan,
thought
it
may
not
make
any
difference
to
any
one
but
to
him
that
i
do
that
the
rule
ought
not
to
be
dependent
as
to
who
gets
to
what
court
first.
in
other
words,
concededly
in
this
case,
there
was
a
prosecution
in
the
state
court
before
there
was
a
proceeding
in
the
federal
court
and
in
that
respect
i
concur
for
what
it
is
worth
with
the
dissenting
views
of
justice
harlan
in
the
dombrowski
case.
and
i
was
talking
about
the
special
circumstances
of
--
in
this
case.
the
other
special
circumstance
is
that
the
statute
is
sweeping
on
its
face,
it
is
an
old
statute,
it
has
been
on
the
statute
books
of
california
over
50
years.
we
have
cited
to
your
honors
in
our
briefs,
studies
which
have
made
about
this
statute
and
its
enforcement
none
of
which
argument
has
been
challenged
by
the
prosecution,
professor
(inaudible),
professor
(inaudible)
of
the
columbia
law
school,
professor
whitney
who
was
cited
by
your
honors
as
an
authority
in
brandenburg,
all
have
come
to
the
view
that
this
statute
was
aimed
against
the
industrial
workers
of
the
world,
that
it
had
been
a
statute
which
an
actual
enforcement
has
been
cruel
with
respect
to
which
california
and
the
entire
nation
ought
to
be
thoroughly
ashamed
because
it
was
used
solely
for
the
purpose
of
suppressing
opinion.
so,
it
is
not
a
current
statute,
adopted
by
the
legislature
of
california
to
need
a
current
danger
or
need
in
california.
it
is
an
old
statute
for
which
i
have
heard
no
favorable
comment
from
any
source
except
from
the
attorney
general
of
california
in
the
briefs
in
this
case.
even
in
this
case
in
order
to
enforce
the
statute,
the
attorney
general
of
california
has
annexed
as
exhibits
to
his
opening
brief,
circulars
published
by
george
lincoln
rockwell
in
the
american
nazi
party
and
other
groups
in
san
francisco
to
show
the
great
dangers
which
california
faces
from
militant
groups,
groups
with
whom
--
with
which
no
claim
was
made
that
harris
had
any
connection
of
any
kind.
so
it
is
the
kind
of
a
statute
which
lends
itself
to
unfair
in
a
harsh
and
cruel
prosecution.
now,
i
conceded
in
the
argument
last
time
that
the
issue
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
could
still
be
adjudicated
by
the
courts
of
california
in
the
event
of
trial.
but
we
think
in
this
case
it
was
proper
for
the
district
court
to
have
granted
the
relief
and
to
have
begun
to
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional
though,
of
course
it
didn’t
do
so
definitively
because
of
the
historic
cruelties
and
evils
accompanying
every
sedition
of
prosecution
with
some
of
them
your
honors
are
familiar.
your
honors
summarized
them
in
the
new
york
times
case
and
we
think
therefore
that
if
a
statute
is
sweeping
on
its
face,
has
in
the
past
been
oppressively
used
is
on
its
face
capable
of
oppression,
that
one
need
not
wait
to
go
through
all
the
state
courts
where
he
has
under
a
particular
procedure
in
a
state
court
attempted
to
secure
a
ruling
from
the
state
court
with
respect
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
which
this
appellee
did
before
he
repaired
to
the
federal
court.
hence
we
think
that
under
these
special
circumstances,
there
is
no
prohibition
so
far
as
the
anti-injunction
statute
is
concerned,
2283
and
so
far
as
the
declaratory
judgment
statute,
it
was
proper,
the
appellee
having
attempted
to
secure
a
redress
under
california
procedure
to
have
repaired
to
the
federal
district
court
for
relief
under
the
federal
civil
rights
act.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
your
honor,
may
i
have
a
second
to
tell
justice
stewart
where
the
order
is
in
the
record?
mr.
a.l.
wirin
thank
you.
i
hope
i’m
not
--
it’s
at
--
its
in
the
appendix
at
page
16.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first
to
deal
quickly
as
far
as
i’m
concerned,
as
far
as
my
time
is
concerned,
with
the
question
put
by
justice
stewart
to
mr.
thompson.
in
the
appellee’s
opening
brief
we
cite
a
gross
or
so
of
california
statutes,
which
penalized
not
only
acts
of
violence,
but
threats
of
violence.
and
in
a
brief
which
is
a
gray
colored,
called
appellees
supplemental
brief
on
re-argument
at
page
17
in
a
footnote,
i
think
it
has
been
said
that
the
heart
of
many
of
the
opinions
of
this
court
are
in
footnotes,
but
that’s
not
to
--
and
then
its
necessary
aside,
anyway,
on
page
17
in
the
footnote
which
begins
on
page
60,
and
footnote
17a,
we
cite
a
statute
in
california,
which
makes
it
a
crime
to
incite
to
riot,
there'd
be
no
violence,
there’d
be
no
actual
violence,
merely
an
incitement
to
riot
is
of
--
is
a
crime
in
california,
as
of
course
it
is
many
states.
now
secondly,
with
respect
to
another
issue
which
i
--
will
which
--
i
think
i
can
deal
quickly,
it
be
this
true
as
mr.
thompson
has
stated
your
honors
that
in
the
suit
filed
on
the
district
court
in
california,
there
were
four
plaintiffs,
three
in
addition
to
the
appellee
harris.
as
to
none
of
the
plaintiffs,
with
the
exception
of
harris,
we
admit
there
was
no
direct
threat
of
prosecution.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
one
was
a
history
teacher.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
one
was
a
member
of
the
same
--
of
the
party,
progressive
labor
party
and
--
mr.
a.l.
wirin
yes,
but
in
any
event
your
honor
--
mr.
a.l.
wirin
i
forgot.
in
any
event,
the
order
which
was
made
by
the
district
court,
an
order
of
preliminary
injunction
was
made
only
for
the
benefit
of
and
for
and
with
respect
to
the
appellee
harris.
and
we
think
the
--
now,
we
are
appellees,
we
think
the
--
all
of
the
appellees
except
harris
are
not
proper
appellees
in
this
court
and
we
think
that
your
honors
so
have
said
that
because
no
injunction
--
mr.
a.l.
wirin
that’s
right,
because
no
injunction
was
issued
after
them
and
indeed
no
declaratory
judgment
really
was
issued
because
the
court
hadn’t
taken
jurisdiction
of
the
merits
of
the
case
in
order
to
declare
their
rights,
though
i
will
debate
that
later.
in
any
event,
it
is
our
view
that
under
the
gun
case,
decided
by
your
honors
last
term
and
indeed
as
i
say,
we
said
this
in
our
--
in
one
of
our
briefs
prior
to
your
honors
ruling,
they
are
not
proper
appellees
and
the
question
is
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
judicable
controversy
between
these
other
three
plaintiffs
and
the
appellant
we
think
is
not
an
issue
which
your
honors
need
to
reach
in
which
certainly
we
do
not
press
which
brings
me
to
discuss
the
issues
which
are
before
your
honors
and
that
is;
first,
i
am
going
to
try
to
avoid
before
your
honors
in
this
session
to
repeat
the
argument
i
made
the
last
year
which
was
bottomed
largely
on
the
first
amendment
for
i
realize
now
more
than
i
did
then
that
there
are
issues
before
--
in
this
court
which
need
to
be
resolved
favorable
to
the
appellee
harris
long
before
the
first
amendment
is
reached
by
this
court.
and
this
issues
which
i
must
--
with
respect
to
which
i
must
concede
i
gave
a
kind
of
summary
at
--
consideration
in
my
argument,
namely
the
applicability
of
section
2283
and
the
problem
of
abstention
of
the
core
issues
to
which
i
want
to
address
myself.
i
of
course
recalled
though
justice
brennan,
may
not
since
he
hears
so
many
lawyers
argue,
his
admonition
to
me
that
i
better
reach
the
problem
of
section
2283
before
long
and
then
my
time
ran
out
before
i
gave
it
a
kind
of
attention
which
i
think
i
can
give
it
this
morning.
now,
we
agree
of
course
that
before
we
can
prevail,
i
say
“we”,
i
mean
he,
harris
can
prevail,
we
have
to
successfully
cross
the
threshold
of
2283.
and
we
think
we
have
done
it
for
the
following
reasons
and
incidentally,
i
am
going
to
assume
for
the
purpose
of
my
argument
that
the
exceptions
to
section
2283
are
not
a
broad
charter
of
rights,
the
exceptions,
to
be
narrowly
construed,
i
needn't
say
that
i
have
in
mind
the
decision
of
your
honors'
the
last
term.
we
think
the
injunction
issued
in
this
case
comes
within
the
number
of
a
--
within
the
exceptions
specifically
provided
for
by
congress
in
section
2283.
first,
we
think
that
the
injunction,
preliminary
injunction
in
the
special
circumstances
of
the
posture
of
the
case
as
it
presented
itself
before
the
three-judge
court
below
that
the
injunction
was
in
aid
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
and
to
borrow,
and
to
use,
and
to
accept
the
phrase
of
this
court
was
necessary
in
the
aid
of
that
jurisdiction
and
to
effectuate
its
judgment
and
that
is
because
of
the
following.
the
matter
came
on
before
the
district
court
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
i
misstating
myself,
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint,
on
a
motion
by
the
state
--
mr.
a.l.
wirin
well,
i’m
not
talking
about
that,
i’m
taking
about
the
jurisdiction
and
the
provident
excise
of
jurisdiction
by
the
district
court.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
i
do
and
expect
to
reach
the
problems
in
the
state
court,
if
time
permitting.
but
in
the
federal
court,
the
posture
of
the
case
was,
a
complaint
had
been
filed,
and
they
think
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional,
the
federal
civil
rights
act,
and
the
defendant,
the
appellant
here,
younger
had
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss.
so,
all
that
the
district
court
had
before
it
was
a
motion
to
dismiss,
and
i
say
all,
because
i
mean
it
did
not
have
the
case
before
it
on
the
merits.
the
case
wasn’t
ready
for
an
adjudication
by
way
of
declaratory
judgment
or
otherwise
on
the
merits,
that
motion
to
dismiss.
the
court
determined
to
overrule
the
motion
to
dismiss.
therefore,
the
next
steps
in
the
case
would
be
the
filing
of
the
some
responsive
pleading
by
the
appellant
here,
to
defendant
there.
a
responsive
pleading,
which
was
never
filed,
was
passed
back.
now,
it
is
our
view
that
wholly
aside
from
the
juri
--
from
any
authority
which
the
district
court
had
to
issue
an
injunction,
it
did
have
authority,
particularly
in
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
this
case,
by
way
of
declaratory
judgment
to
pass
upon
the
statute
and
to
determine
whether
on
its
face
it
was
overbroad.
therefore,
it
had
jurisdiction
over
the
cause
and
continued
to
have
jurisdiction
over
the
cause,
until
the
merits
of
the
cause
were
before
the
district
court.
and
until
the
merits
of
the
cause,
namely
whether
or
not
the
court
should
by
way
of
declaratory
judgment,
determine
whether
or
not
the
statute
was
constitutional
on
its
face
until
it
reached
that
point,
the
court
had
authority
under
section
2283
to
issue
interstitial,
pendente
lite,
injunctive
relief,
which
it
did.
so
as
to
maintain
a
jurisdiction
over
the
cause
or
if
no
preliminary
injunction
were
issued,
i’m
assuming
of
course
it
had
jurisdiction
ultimately
by
way
of
declaratory
judgment
to
decide
the
constitution
under
the
statute.
for
the
purpose
of
my
present
argument,
if
no
preliminary
injunction
issued,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court,
thereafter,
after
the
defendant
upon
here
filed
a
responsive
pleading,
to
adjudicate
the
statute
would
have
been
aborted,
would
have
been
mooted,
if
the
proceeding,
setting
aside
the
problem
that
the
statutes,
i’ll
come
to
in
a
moment,
if
the
proceeding
were
allowed
to
go
forward
in
a
state
court.
so
in
order
to
--
in
our
view
to
maintain
a
jurisdiction,
in
order
to
protect
and
effectuate
any
judgment,
i’m
now
paraphrasing
the
language
of
section
2283,
which
judgment
it
had
jurisdiction
to
make
thereafter,
we
think
it
had
authority
to
issue
this
interstitial
preliminary
injunction
until
it
could
reach
the
merits.
moreover,
there
is
the
civil
--
mr.
a.l.
wirin
well,
that
--
you
know
your
honor
that’s
kind
of
a
double-edged
sword,
but
i’ll
take
this
--
i’ll
take
up
a
sword
nonetheless
but
--
mr.
a.l.
wirin
one
at
your
time,
there
was.
in
other
words,
the
--
i
may
have
run
into
the
problems
by
the
abstention.
in
answer
to
your
honor’s
question
i
did,
but
i
do,
that
has
to
say
the
state
said
that
it
would
go
forward
with
the
prosecution,
unless
the
federal
court
issued
an
injunction.
so
that
we
felt
there
was
--
we
felt
--
we
feel
now
there
was
a
necessity
of
some
kind
of
interstitial
injunctive
relief
under
section
2283.
now
additionally,
as
your
honors
know
of
course,
because
of
your
concern
with
this
problem
and
your
--
the
ruling
of
your
honors,
in
the
atlantic
case
last
term,
we
think
you
know
of
course
that
section
2283
in
addition
to
the
exception
which
i’ve
discussed,
also
makes
it
–
tabs
out
of
section
where
there
was
an
act
of
congress.
now
we
think
here,
your
honor,
there
are
two
acts
of
congress.
i
suppose
one
would
be
sufficient
if
it
--
it
was
sufficient.
one
is
the
civil
rights
act,
which
i
do
not
propose
to
argue
in
oral
argument
because
i
know
it
will
be
argued
fully
in
oral
argument
in
the
cases
following,
and
as
in
the
brief
extensively
that
statute
confers
jurisdiction
on
a
federal
court
to
grant
relief
under
federal
civil
rights
act.
at
law,
in
equity,
or
in
any
other
manner
and
i
suppose
injunction
is
equity
and
so
we
think
it’s
an
exception.
moreover,
we
think
it
is
not
accidental,
but
on
the
contrary
it
is
meaningful
that
section
2283,
of
the
28
u.s.
code
follows
section
2281,
just
precedes
section
2284
and
those
sections
expressly
confer
jurisdiction
upon
a
federal
court
to
adjudge
a
state
statue
to
be
unconstitutional
and
to
issue
an
injunction
against
such
statutes,
where
a
federal
court
and
i
say
did,
that
statute
conferred
jurisdiction
on
a
federal
court,
to
hold
a
state
statute
unconstitutional,
to
issue
injunction,
where
that
statute
repugnant
to
the
constitution.
now,
the
purpose
of
this
suit,
the
thrust
of
the
suit
filed
in
the
district
court
was
that
this
statute
was
repugnant
to
the
constitution
because
it’s
violating
the
first
amendment.
and
so,
if
your
honors
won't
accept
before,
exception
which
i’ve
indicated,
i
hope
you’ll
find
one
of
these
exceptions
not
wanting
and
therefore,
there
has
been
a
compliance
with
section
2283.
but
even
if
section
2283
and
as
i
say,
i’m
kind
--
i’m
giving
in
my
argument,
the
exceptions
are
narrow
rather
than
a
broad
or
latitude
in
area
of
liberal
construction.
assuming
we
can
encounter
and
jump
a
hurdle
of
2283,
if
we
can't
we
are
done
so
far
as
the
injunction
is
concerned,
but
we
think
we’re
not
undone,
it
would've
been
a
done
undone
part,
but
didn’t
--
nonetheless,
there
was
the
problem
of
that
abstention
and
i
would
do
a
disservice
to
the
court,
as
well
as
to
mr.
harris,
if
i
stuck
my
hand,
hid
in
the
sand
and
didn’t
recognize
the
importance
of
that
question
and
the
importance
to
which
--
the
importance
which
this
court
has
--
(inaudible)
this
court
has
treated
that
question.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
your
honor,
depends
what
recently
means,
not
this
term,
we
filed
two
briefs,
the
last
term
and
in
that
connection,
if
your
honor
will
permit
me,
i
want
to
say
something
about
the
length
of
this
case
and
i
know
your
honors
will
--
hope
your
honors
will
not
take
umbrageous
what
i
say.
this
case
has
been
in
the
courts
a
long
time,
but
it
has
been
literally
three
years
in
this
court
and
it's
not
a
question
of
placing
blame
on
any
one
but
we
hope
you
won’t
--
i’ll
go
to
say,
take
it
out
on
the
appellee
because
of
the
delay.
there
have
been
delays
in
this
case
due
to
the
fact
that
this
court
has
not
been
complete
and
there
was
also
delay
in
the
district
court,
i
will
concede
because
at
the
time
the
district
court
had
the
matter,
this
court
had
not
yet
decided
brandenburg.
this
court
was
confront
--
the
district
court
was
confronted
with
the
problem,
of
the
kind
of
anticipating
what
the
present
law
was
and
it
ruled
that
whitney
was
no
longer
viable
in
view
of
other
decisions
of
this
court
made
that
ruling
prior
to
brandenburg.
now
i
view
with
the
problem
of
abstention
and
it's
--
and
if
i
may
say
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
in
declaring
or
adjudging
judicial
policy
as
it
does,
can
control
the
improvident
issues
and
issues
of
injunctions
or
even
declaratory
judgments
by
the
district
courts
through
their
judicial
formula
of
abstention
and
that
matter
is
of
course
entirely
in
your
honors'
hands.
now
for
the
purposes
of
my
argument,
i’m
going
to
assume
that
it
is
the
law,
i’m
not
talking
about
abstention
as
distinguished
from
injunction
that
there
should
be
abstention
only
in
unusual
cases
because
i
think
i
--
or
as
i
try
to
recognize
that
under
our
system,
the
federal
district
courts
should
intervene
or
intercede
albeit
the
right
which
are
at
stake
are
in
the
first
amendment
and
hence,
some
consider
the
most
important
of
rights,
not
in
–
certainly
not
in
every
case
and
so
i’m
saying
in
the
unusual
case.
and
if
that
is
the
--
if
that
is
the
proper
standard,
and
i
think
it's
a
narrower
standard
that
this
court
has
been
imposing
on
the
issue
of
abstention.
we
think
it
was
proper
for
the
district
court
in
the
special
circumstances
of
this
case
and
as
i
read
the
decisions
of
this
court,
whenever
this
court
comes
to
grips
with
the
problem
of
abstention,
it
considers
the
special
circumstances
of
the
case.
under
the
special
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
district
court
did
not
abuse
its
discretion,
i
think
it
is
a
matter
of
discretion
subject
of
course
to
review
in
this
court,
to
review
in
this
court
in
retaining
jurisdiction
until
it
had
an
opportunity
to
decide
the
matter
on
the
merits
and
to
determine
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
now,
i
suggest
that
the
following
circumstances
in
this
case
are
the
special
circumstances
which
warranted
the
district
court
in
not
abstaining
in
view
of
the
special
circumstances.
first,
the
statute
involved
here,
i'll
interpret
myself,
i
cannot
see
or
understand
the
argument
of
the
attorney
general
that
the
statute
applies
to
act
unless
the
word
act
encompasses
just
speech.
on
its
face,
the
statute
applies
to
doctrines
and
presets.
as
applied,
it
applies
to
a
person
who
distributed
two
leaflets.
but
passing
that,
it
is
urged
by
the
attorney
general
in
his
briefs
as
it
was
before
your
honors
in
oral
argument
that
the
district
court
should
not
have
attempted
to
pass
upon
provisions
in
the
statute
other
than
those
--
other
than
that
under
which
the
appellee
harris
was
prosecuted.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
implicitly
a
confession
that
this
statute
is
aimed
only
at
speech,
is
not
capable
of
clarification
or
construction
in
one
criminal
prosecution.
and
as
i
understand
the
decisions
of
this
court,
baggett
versus
bullitt
and
the
dissent
in
cameron
versus
johnson,
the
first
cameron
versus
johnson
where
a
statute
which
affects
speech,
it
effects
pure
speech
as
we
say
is
not
capable
of
being
hammered
out
in
one
prosecution.
and
where
it
expects
--
effects
speech
in
contradistinction
to
a
statute
which
effects
conduct,
that’s
the
kind
of
a
statute
with
respect
to
which,
there
may
be
no
abstention
as
there
was
no
abstention
in
baggett
versus
bullitt.
and
i’m
not
going
to
talk
about
dombrowski
because
i
just
i
don’t
know
and
i
suppose
no
human
being
knows
what
a
majority
of
this
court
thinks
about
dombrowski,
except
that
i
think
that
it
is
a
great
decision
and
--
but
my
thoughts
needn't
be
expressed.
incidentally,
there
was
one
matter
with
respect
to
injunction
which
i
didn’t
say
that
i
must
say
that
is
with
--
and
that
is
that
in
connection
with
the
matter
of
the
propriety
of
the
federal
court
issuing
an
injunction,
i
share
the
views
of
justice
harlan,
thought
it
may
not
make
any
difference
to
any
one
but
to
him
that
i
do
that
the
rule
ought
not
to
be
dependent
as
to
who
gets
to
what
court
first.
in
other
words,
concededly
in
this
case,
there
was
a
prosecution
in
the
state
court
before
there
was
a
proceeding
in
the
federal
court
and
in
that
respect
i
concur
for
what
it
is
worth
with
the
dissenting
views
of
justice
harlan
in
the
dombrowski
case.
and
i
was
talking
about
the
special
circumstances
of
--
in
this
case.
the
other
special
circumstance
is
that
the
statute
is
sweeping
on
its
face,
it
is
an
old
statute,
it
has
been
on
the
statute
books
of
california
over
50
years.
we
have
cited
to
your
honors
in
our
briefs,
studies
which
have
made
about
this
statute
and
its
enforcement
none
of
which
argument
has
been
challenged
by
the
prosecution,
professor
(inaudible),
professor
(inaudible)
of
the
columbia
law
school,
professor
whitney
who
was
cited
by
your
honors
as
an
authority
in
brandenburg,
all
have
come
to
the
view
that
this
statute
was
aimed
against
the
industrial
workers
of
the
world,
that
it
had
been
a
statute
which
an
actual
enforcement
has
been
cruel
with
respect
to
which
california
and
the
entire
nation
ought
to
be
thoroughly
ashamed
because
it
was
used
solely
for
the
purpose
of
suppressing
opinion.
so,
it
is
not
a
current
statute,
adopted
by
the
legislature
of
california
to
need
a
current
danger
or
need
in
california.
it
is
an
old
statute
for
which
i
have
heard
no
favorable
comment
from
any
source
except
from
the
attorney
general
of
california
in
the
briefs
in
this
case.
even
in
this
case
in
order
to
enforce
the
statute,
the
attorney
general
of
california
has
annexed
as
exhibits
to
his
opening
brief,
circulars
published
by
george
lincoln
rockwell
in
the
american
nazi
party
and
other
groups
in
san
francisco
to
show
the
great
dangers
which
california
faces
from
militant
groups,
groups
with
whom
--
with
which
no
claim
was
made
that
harris
had
any
connection
of
any
kind.
so
it
is
the
kind
of
a
statute
which
lends
itself
to
unfair
in
a
harsh
and
cruel
prosecution.
now,
i
conceded
in
the
argument
last
time
that
the
issue
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
could
still
be
adjudicated
by
the
courts
of
california
in
the
event
of
trial.
but
we
think
in
this
case
it
was
proper
for
the
district
court
to
have
granted
the
relief
and
to
have
begun
to
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional
though,
of
course
it
didn’t
do
so
definitively
because
of
the
historic
cruelties
and
evils
accompanying
every
sedition
of
prosecution
with
some
of
them
your
honors
are
familiar.
your
honors
summarized
them
in
the
new
york
times
case
and
we
think
therefore
that
if
a
statute
is
sweeping
on
its
face,
has
in
the
past
been
oppressively
used
is
on
its
face
capable
of
oppression,
that
one
need
not
wait
to
go
through
all
the
state
courts
where
he
has
under
a
particular
procedure
in
a
state
court
attempted
to
secure
a
ruling
from
the
state
court
with
respect
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
which
this
appellee
did
before
he
repaired
to
the
federal
court.
hence
we
think
that
under
these
special
circumstances,
there
is
no
prohibition
so
far
as
the
anti-injunction
statute
is
concerned,
2283
and
so
far
as
the
declaratory
judgment
statute,
it
was
proper,
the
appellee
having
attempted
to
secure
a
redress
under
california
procedure
to
have
repaired
to
the
federal
district
court
for
relief
under
the
federal
civil
rights
act.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
your
honor,
may
i
have
a
second
to
tell
justice
stewart
where
the
order
is
in
the
record?
mr.
a.l.
wirin
thank
you.
i
hope
i’m
not
--
it’s
at
--
its
in
the
appendix
at
page
