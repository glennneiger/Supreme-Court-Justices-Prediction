mr.
sam
rosenwein
may
it
please
the
court.
the
statute
that
was
presented
to
the
district
court
was
a
pure
speech
statute.
it
punishes
advocacy,
teaching,
justifying,
publishing,
editing,
circulating,
assembly,
joining;
it
was
not
a
conduct
statute.
our
brief
outlines
the
(inaudible)
of
the
statutes
that
the
state
has.
i'm
not
going
in
the
facts
any
more
than
counsel
being
but
i
simply
would
like
to
state
that
all
that
is
involved
in
this
case
is
a
young
man
distributing
in
the
civic
center
not
in
the
black
area
and
the
civic
center
outside
on
the
street
while
people
were
hawking
newspapers
and
while
men
were
distributing
religious
track
such
as
customary
in
los
angeles
just
the
same
this
young
man
was
distributing
two
leaflets
and
that
is
what
he
pays
is
28
years
in
jail
for.
two
counts
for
28
years
on
each
count.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
no.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
he
hasn't
but
he
faces
that
and
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
possibility.
now,
then
in
addition
as
it
has
been
pointed
out,
he
raised
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
and
raised
it
in
appropriate
manner
in
the
state
courts,
995
motion,
petition
for
writ
of
prohibition,
these
are
customary
procedures,
these
are
remedies
in
the
state
court
are
accepted,
they
are
the
test
for
constitutionality.
and
then,
petition
for
writ
of
hearing
denied
each
time
as
a
matter
of
fact
state
opposing
consideration
by
the
court.
it
was
this
record,
--
it's
on
this
basis
that
the
court
below,
the
three-judge
court
passed
on
two
consideration
of
the
statute.
this
man,
these
petitioners
or
these
appellees
are
not
too
often
here
for
the
appellees.
these
appellees
came
to
court
claiming
their
rights
on
the
section
1983.
that's
the
law
of
united
states.
those
who
were
deprived
of
rights
under
that
law
are
entitled
to
go
to
a
federal
forum.
so,
they
did
and
that
court
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
was
compelled,
had
no
other
way,
it
was
his
duty
to
undertake
the
consideration
of
the
complaint
that
was
presented.
a
motion
to
dismiss
was
made
by
the
state,
an
acceptance
therefore
of
everything
that
was
alleged
in
the
complaint.
and
that
complaint
alleged
that
harris
faced
the
indictment
that
he
had
raised
these
issues
and
the
courts
in
the
state
had
refused
to
consider
them.
it
raised
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
statute
on
its
face
claiming
that
it
violated
the
first
amendment.
its
most
sensorial
aspects,
it
was
suppressive,
it
obviously
was
vague,
it
was
obviously
overbroad.
the
cases
that
run
from
fiske
against
kansas
not
the
more
recent
ones,
there
are
cases
that
run
from
the
young
against
oregon,
the
thornhill
against
alabama,
herndon
against
lowry.
all
of
these
cases
including
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
(inaudible)
etcetera
and
dombrowski
all
pointed
to
only
one
direction
that
this
statute
was
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
the
court
therefore,
felt
it
was
obliged
to
reexamine
whitney
in
the
light
of
the
developing
constitutional
doctrine
that
had
gone
on
since
that
time.
and
it
could
only
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
statute
on
its
face
was
clearly
invalid.
and
this
is
not
really
disputed
and
the
briefs
in
this
by
the
appellant
because
what
the
effects
say
are
really
two
aspects.
one,
that
after
all
the
state
courts
have
interpreted
the
criminal
syndicalism
law
and
interpreted
such
a
way
as
to
satisfy
first
amendment
guarantees.
and
that
in
any
event
some
of
the
petitioners
do
not
have
standing
and
that
the
one
harris
cannot
obtain
his
injunctive
relief
because
of
section
2283.
there
is
no
and
cannot
be
any
serious
claim
that
this
statute
today
on
its
face
is
not
unconstitutional.
and
courts
--
three-judge
courts
in
kentucky,
in
mississippi,
in
georgia
have
all
declared
this
statute
--
criminal
syndicalism
statute
to
be
unconstitutional
on
their
face.
and
i
might
say
that
some
of
the
judges
in
their
opinions
have
indicated
that
they
couldn't
concede
of
an
argument
that
could
today
constitutionally
support
the
validity
of
a
criminal
syndicalism
statute.
and
what
is
it
therefore
that
the
appellant
really
is
arguing
here?
the
first,
the
argument
is
made
that
three
of
my
appellees
don't
have
standing
that
a
case
of
controversy
is
not
presented.
is
that
accurate
on
this
record?
they
accepted
our
allegations
that
a
teacher
in
a
state
college
is
teaching
the
doctrines
of
karl
marx
is
teaching
about
the
communist
manifesto
is
teaching
revolutionary
doctrine
and
in
the
light
of
the
statute
and
in
the
light
of
the
indictment
of
this
young
man
who
distributed
two
leaflets
that
this
statute
is
going
to
be
enforced
they
feel
inhibited.
this
teacher
feels
inhibited,
uncertain
as
to
what
he
can
and
cannot
teach
without
defending
this
law.
the
two
members
of
the
progressive
labor
party
and
the
leaflets
for
the
impressive
--
progressive
labor
party
say
that
they
and
their
organization
advocates
the
replacement
of
capitalism
by
socialism.
it
advocates
the
abolition.
they
advocate
the
abolition
of
the
profit
system.
under
those
circumstances
although
they
say
they
advocated
in
peaceful
times
they
asked
and
are
uncertain
and
feeling
inhibited
as
to
what
they
can
and
cannot
say
without
meeting
some
find
of
a
prosecution.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
yes,
that
is
my
position.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
i
think
the
dombrowski
and
zwickler
at
least
indicate
that
where
statute
is
patently
invalid
on
its
face
and
where
the
party
has
indicated
and
it's
accepted
for
the
purpose
of
this
record
that
they
are
engaged
in
the
area
of
speech
and
press
that
may
come
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
--
maybe
interpreted
but
then
of
course
that
they
have
a
right,
they
have
a
standing
and
i
might
say
your
honor
speaks
of
overt
act
if
you
mean
indictment
to
a
threatened
indictment,
i
would
say
that
that
hasn't
happened
in
this
case.
that
may
be
true
but
we
were
asking
for
declaratory
judgment
for
these
people.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
yes,
that
record
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
and
we
don't
have
an
exact
replay
of
that
but
we
do
have
overt
acts.
now,
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
i'd
say
this;
one,
harris
has
been
indicted.
there
is
a
threat
that
this
statute
is
going
to
be
used
and
these
persons
have
alleged
it
is
accepted
that
they
are
precisely
in
the
areas
where
this
threat
by
the
state
against
one
person
may
flow
to
them.
this
is
not
come
off
the
street
as
some
one
who
really
has
no
interest.
these
are
persons
who
say,
we
advocate
socialism,
we
are
teaching
marks.
we
are
teaching
those
revolutionary
doctrines
that
might
be
swept
within
the
ambit
of
the
statute
and
that
invalids
it
seems
to
me
and
if
your
honors
will
read
this
brief
of
the
appellants
and
notice
the
pages
devoted
to
documents
and
language,
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
apostles
of
violence
are
stuck
in
california.
california's
top
link,
it
is
absolutely
essential
that
we
have
this
law
and
you
will
see
that
they
intend
to
enforce
this
to
the
hilt
and
the
enforcement
is
to
suppress
speech
and
protest
not
conduct
because
they
have
a
hundred
statutes
for
that.
so,
we
think
we
have
stand,
we
think
all
of
us
have
standing.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
he
said
he
didn't
think
that
they
would
be
indicted.
but
he
couldn't,
i
don't
think
the
writer
would
say
that
they
are
not
inhibited.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
i
--
it's
generous
way
of
putting
it
but
there
is
another
aspect
that
we're
arguing
and
that
is
that
our
appellees
are
afraid
to
talk,
are
afraid
to
teach
and
that's
not
denying.
it's
accepted
for
the
purposes
of
this
case.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
widely
on
the
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
with
respect
to
criminal
syndicalism
law?
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
they
your
honor
--
they
have
not
done
anything
at
this
moment
overtly.
they
have
not
indicted
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
i
don't
want
to
put
into
dombrowski
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
no,
no.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
no.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
no,
there
hasn't.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
i
don't
think
so
and
the
reason
i
don't
think
so
because
i
read
dombrowski
and
here
is
why
i
hesitate
to
say
to
answer
your
honor
as
i
read
dombrowski
either
it's
true
that
they
were
those
harassing
events
in
dombrowski
but
there
was
also
of
the
statement
that
if
there
is
a
patently
invalid
statute
on
its
face
abridging
freedom
speech,
press
assembly
and
the
right
to
petition
for
grievance
as
this
statute
does.
then,
one
who
comes
within
the
ambit
and
shows
that
he
does
come
within
the
ambit
would
have
a
right
to
come
in
for
declaratory
relief
or
any
injunctive
relief
if
any
were
necessary.
now,
that
is
how
i
interpreted
and
that's
why
i'm
saying
it
might
not
be
necessary
to
extend
but
if
it
is,
if
it
is
necessary
to
extend
it,
i
ask
the
court
to
extend
it
not
because
i
think
this
will
not
and
cause
a
whole
flat
of
litigation
to
come
in
to
the
federal
courts
anymore
than
the
habeas
corpus
situation
which
led
the
house
in
outcries
and
really
had
simmered
down
and
much
justice
has
been
done
in
the
light
of
decisions
of
this
court
in
fay
against
noia
and
townsend
against
burke.
i
think
that
the
federal
courts
can
do
the
same
screening
individual
judges
can
look
and
see
whether
claims
are
frivolous
and
refuse
to
have
a
three-judge
court
but
if
the
statute
is
patently
invalid
on
its
face,
the
three-judge
court
should
be
convene
and
should
give
the
relief
that
the
plaintiff
is
entitled
to
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
no,
sir.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
yes,
there
are
number
aspects
to
that.
my
answer
is
yes
with
this
explanation.
first,
if
i
have
review
very
carefully
the
decisions
of
the
california
courts
since
1919
up
to
the
time
the
last
time
they
spoke
on
the
california
--
on
the
criminal
syndicalism
law.
and
the
construction
there
is
broad
and
is
not
restricted
and
does
not
follow
the
constitutional
doctrines
enunciated
by
this
court
interpreting
the
constitution.
i
might
say
following
danskin,
counsel
has
pointed
out
that
danskin
came,
the
issue
was
not
directly
presented
and
all
the
courts
were
simply
saying
if
you're
trying
to
implement
this
criminal
syndicalism
law,
of
course
there
got
to
be
a
clear
and
present
danger
and
of
course
the
american
civil
liberties
union
and
wants
to
use
this
school
auditorium
does
not
express
in
present
danger
and
that
was
it.
but
if
you
read
all
of
the
decisions
as
i
read
it
in
22
and
23
of
my
brief
and
read
the
decision
that
followed
almost
by
10
years
the
decision
in
danskin
and
that
is
black
against
cutter
laboratories
where
mrs.
walker
and
i
quote
from
it
on
page
22,
“was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
whereupon
the
supreme
court
of
california
said
that
constitutes
a
violation
of
the
california
criminal
syndicalism
act
per
se”.
so,
that
you
--
from
the
constructions
they
are
not
limited
and
of
course
the
court
refused
to
pass
on
it
when
we
asked
them
to.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
vogel.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
i
think
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
my
recollection
is
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
yes.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
it
wasn't
on
criminal
syndicalism
or
anything
of
that
kind
but
it
has
some
first
amendment
aspects
of
my
recollection
is
that
i
think
it
had
to
do
something
with
political
activities
of
employees.
they
were
given
the
right
of
some
infringement
along
that
line,
excellent
opinion
and
the
court
felt
indicated
that
supreme
court
was
of
course
concerned
about
the
first
amendment
rights
but
again
the
district
court
down
below
said
counsel
--
the
plaintiff
here
went
to
the
courts
all
the
way
through
and
we
are
bound
not
to
wait
and
validation
that
may
take
a
year
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
no,
no.
it
went
up.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
not
a
decision
but
a
petition
writ
of
prohibition
was
filed
and
the
district
court
of
appeals
was
denied.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
not
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
no
opinion.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
petition
for
hearing.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
yes
under
section
9
but
there,
the
court
held
the
statute
was
constitutional.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
he
wrote
--
not
wrote.
he
issued
a
oral
opinion.
he
said,
i
think
it's
constitutional.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
not
in
the
record
here.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
oh!
yes.
the
documents
were
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
no,
he
--
the
arguments
were
made
as
to
the
invalidity
and
at
length
and
same
arguments
made
or
i
will
say
down
below
great
line
is
placed
on
whitney
by
the
district
attorney.
constantly,
asserting
that
whitney
governed
and
that
should
be
the
end
of
it.
and
the
court
said,
“i
think
it's
constitutional.”
i
think
we
have
to
go
try
it.
and
that's
somewhat
we
saw
at
review.
and
now,
as
to
2283,
i
subscribe
to
the
view
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
no,
that
was
the
point
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
i
think
you
would
probably
get
insurances
from
the
state
that
if
the
judgment
was
affirmed
that
they
would
not
prosecuted
--
i
assume
you
would
get
those
but
down
below
it
was
the
injunction
was
issued
to
assure
the
state
the
right
to
appeal.
i
would
say
that
i
stand
for
the
position
whether
i
needed
it
or
not.
i
stand
for
the
position
that
2283
is
not
about
to
the
grant
of
an
injunction
even
on
appending
case
where
there's
appending
indictment.
i
think
where
there
is
a
declaratory
judgment
for
example
that
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
then
to
effectuate
the
judgment
where
irreparable
injury
is
done
by
the
face
of
the
statute
then
to
effectuate
the
judgment
which
is
another
exception
of
the
2283.
we
should
have
a
right
to
get
whatever
injunctive
relief
we
need.
in
addition,
i
think
history
and
law
would
indicate
that
those
who
passed
the
act
of
1871
the
predecessor
to
1983
must
have
intended
even
if
they
didn't
say
so
that
the
federal
courts
should
have
the
power
to
issue
an
injunction
staying
in
court
--
state
court
proceedings
to
protect
civil
rights
when
those
situations
arose.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
no,
it
wasn't
raised
by
the
(voice
overlap).
mr.
sam
rosenwein
it
wasn't
raised
by
the
other
side.
they
have
raised
it.
they
didn't
raise
it
actually
in
a
jurisdictional
statement
either.
they
have
raised
it
for
the
first
time
here.
well,
for
all
those
reasons,
i
would
urge
the
affirmance
of
the
judgment
below
and
i
think
that
the
act
--
the
criminal
syndicalism
laws
i
might
say
in
the
criminality
laws
ought
to
be
entered
with
the
seditious
liable
laws
and
bad
tendency
test
and
other
relics
of
that
kind.
thank
you.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
may
it
please
the
court.
the
statute
that
was
presented
to
the
district
court
was
a
pure
speech
statute.
it
punishes
advocacy,
teaching,
justifying,
publishing,
editing,
circulating,
assembly,
joining;
it
was
not
a
conduct
statute.
our
brief
outlines
the
(inaudible)
of
the
statutes
that
the
state
has.
i'm
not
going
in
the
facts
any
more
than
counsel
being
but
i
simply
would
like
to
state
that
all
that
is
involved
in
this
case
is
a
young
man
distributing
in
the
civic
center
not
in
the
black
area
and
the
civic
center
outside
on
the
street
while
people
were
hawking
newspapers
and
while
men
were
distributing
religious
track
such
as
customary
in
los
angeles
just
the
same
this
young
man
was
distributing
two
leaflets
and
that
is
what
he
pays
is
28
years
in
jail
for.
two
counts
for
28
years
on
each
count.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
no.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
he
hasn't
but
he
faces
that
and
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
possibility.
now,
then
in
addition
as
it
has
been
pointed
out,
he
raised
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
and
raised
it
in
appropriate
manner
in
the
state
courts,
995
motion,
petition
for
writ
of
prohibition,
these
are
customary
procedures,
these
are
remedies
in
the
state
court
are
accepted,
they
are
the
test
for
constitutionality.
and
then,
petition
for
writ
of
hearing
denied
each
time
as
a
matter
of
fact
state
opposing
consideration
by
the
court.
it
was
this
record,
--
it's
on
this
basis
that
the
court
below,
the
three-judge
court
passed
on
two
consideration
of
the
statute.
this
man,
these
petitioners
or
these
appellees
are
not
too
often
here
for
the
appellees.
these
appellees
came
to
court
claiming
their
rights
on
the
section
1983.
that's
the
law
of
united
states.
those
who
were
deprived
of
rights
under
that
law
are
entitled
to
go
to
a
federal
forum.
so,
they
did
and
that
court
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
was
compelled,
had
no
other
way,
it
was
his
duty
to
undertake
the
consideration
of
the
complaint
that
was
presented.
a
motion
to
dismiss
was
made
by
the
state,
an
acceptance
therefore
of
everything
that
was
alleged
in
the
complaint.
and
that
complaint
alleged
that
harris
faced
the
indictment
that
he
had
raised
these
issues
and
the
courts
in
the
state
had
refused
to
consider
them.
it
raised
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
statute
on
its
face
claiming
that
it
violated
the
first
amendment.
its
most
sensorial
aspects,
it
was
suppressive,
it
obviously
was
vague,
it
was
obviously
overbroad.
the
cases
that
run
from
fiske
against
kansas
not
the
more
recent
ones,
there
are
cases
that
run
from
the
young
against
oregon,
the
thornhill
against
alabama,
herndon
against
lowry.
all
of
these
cases
including
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
(inaudible)
etcetera
and
dombrowski
all
pointed
to
only
one
direction
that
this
statute
was
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
the
court
therefore,
felt
it
was
obliged
to
reexamine
whitney
in
the
light
of
the
developing
constitutional
doctrine
that
had
gone
on
since
that
time.
and
it
could
only
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
statute
on
its
face
was
clearly
invalid.
and
this
is
not
really
disputed
and
the
briefs
in
this
by
the
appellant
because
what
the
effects
say
are
really
two
aspects.
one,
that
after
all
the
state
courts
have
interpreted
the
criminal
syndicalism
law
and
interpreted
such
a
way
as
to
satisfy
first
amendment
guarantees.
and
that
in
any
event
some
of
the
petitioners
do
not
have
standing
and
that
the
one
harris
cannot
obtain
his
injunctive
relief
because
of
section
2283.
there
is
no
and
cannot
be
any
serious
claim
that
this
statute
today
on
its
face
is
not
unconstitutional.
and
courts
--
three-judge
courts
in
kentucky,
in
mississippi,
in
georgia
have
all
declared
this
statute
--
criminal
syndicalism
statute
to
be
unconstitutional
on
their
face.
and
i
might
say
that
some
of
the
judges
in
their
opinions
have
indicated
that
they
couldn't
concede
of
an
argument
that
could
today
constitutionally
support
the
validity
of
a
criminal
syndicalism
statute.
and
what
is
it
therefore
that
the
appellant
really
is
arguing
here?
the
first,
the
argument
is
made
that
three
of
my
appellees
don't
have
standing
that
a
case
of
controversy
is
not
presented.
is
that
accurate
on
this
record?
they
accepted
our
allegations
that
a
teacher
in
a
state
college
is
teaching
the
doctrines
of
karl
marx
is
teaching
about
the
communist
manifesto
is
teaching
revolutionary
doctrine
and
in
the
light
of
the
statute
and
in
the
light
of
the
indictment
of
this
young
man
who
distributed
two
leaflets
that
this
statute
is
going
to
be
enforced
they
feel
inhibited.
this
teacher
feels
inhibited,
uncertain
as
to
what
he
can
and
cannot
teach
without
defending
this
law.
the
two
members
of
the
progressive
labor
party
and
the
leaflets
for
the
impressive
--
progressive
labor
party
say
that
they
and
their
organization
advocates
the
replacement
of
capitalism
by
socialism.
it
advocates
the
abolition.
they
advocate
the
abolition
of
the
profit
system.
under
those
circumstances
although
they
say
they
advocated
in
peaceful
times
they
asked
and
are
uncertain
and
feeling
inhibited
as
to
what
they
can
and
cannot
say
without
meeting
some
find
of
a
prosecution.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
yes,
that
is
my
position.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
i
think
the
dombrowski
and
zwickler
at
least
indicate
that
where
statute
is
patently
invalid
on
its
face
and
where
the
party
has
indicated
and
it's
accepted
for
the
purpose
of
this
record
that
they
are
engaged
in
the
area
of
speech
and
press
that
may
come
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
--
maybe
interpreted
but
then
of
course
that
they
have
a
right,
they
have
a
standing
and
i
might
say
your
honor
speaks
of
overt
act
if
you
mean
indictment
to
a
threatened
indictment,
i
would
say
that
that
hasn't
happened
in
this
case.
that
may
be
true
but
we
were
asking
for
declaratory
judgment
for
these
people.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
yes,
that
record
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
and
we
don't
have
an
exact
replay
of
that
but
we
do
have
overt
acts.
now,
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
i'd
say
this;
one,
harris
has
been
indicted.
there
is
a
threat
that
this
statute
is
going
to
be
used
and
these
persons
have
alleged
it
is
accepted
that
they
are
precisely
in
the
areas
where
this
threat
by
the
state
against
one
person
may
flow
to
them.
this
is
not
come
off
the
street
as
some
one
who
really
has
no
interest.
these
are
persons
who
say,
we
advocate
socialism,
we
are
teaching
marks.
we
are
teaching
those
revolutionary
doctrines
that
might
be
swept
within
the
ambit
of
the
statute
and
that
invalids
it
seems
to
me
and
if
your
honors
will
read
this
brief
of
the
appellants
and
notice
the
pages
devoted
to
documents
and
language,
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
apostles
of
violence
are
stuck
in
california.
california's
top
link,
it
is
absolutely
essential
that
we
have
this
law
and
you
will
see
that
they
intend
to
enforce
this
to
the
hilt
and
the
enforcement
is
to
suppress
speech
and
protest
not
conduct
because
they
have
a
hundred
statutes
for
that.
so,
we
think
we
have
stand,
we
think
all
of
us
have
standing.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
he
said
he
didn't
think
that
they
would
be
indicted.
but
he
couldn't,
i
don't
think
the
writer
would
say
that
they
are
not
inhibited.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
i
--
it's
generous
way
of
putting
it
but
there
is
another
aspect
that
we're
arguing
and
that
is
that
our
appellees
are
afraid
to
talk,
are
afraid
to
teach
and
that's
not
denying.
it's
accepted
for
the
purposes
of
this
case.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
widely
on
the
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
with
respect
to
criminal
syndicalism
law?
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
they
your
honor
--
they
have
not
done
anything
at
this
moment
overtly.
they
have
not
indicted
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
i
don't
want
to
put
into
dombrowski
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
no,
no.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
no.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
no,
there
hasn't.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
i
don't
think
so
and
the
reason
i
don't
think
so
because
i
read
dombrowski
and
here
is
why
i
hesitate
to
say
to
answer
your
honor
as
i
read
dombrowski
either
it's
true
that
they
were
those
harassing
events
in
dombrowski
but
there
was
also
of
the
statement
that
if
there
is
a
patently
invalid
statute
on
its
face
abridging
freedom
speech,
press
assembly
and
the
right
to
petition
for
grievance
as
this
statute
does.
then,
one
who
comes
within
the
ambit
and
shows
that
he
does
come
within
the
ambit
would
have
a
right
to
come
in
for
declaratory
relief
or
any
injunctive
relief
if
any
were
necessary.
now,
that
is
how
i
interpreted
and
that's
why
i'm
saying
it
might
not
be
necessary
to
extend
but
if
it
is,
if
it
is
necessary
to
extend
it,
i
ask
the
court
to
extend
it
not
because
i
think
this
will
not
and
cause
a
whole
flat
of
litigation
to
come
in
to
the
federal
courts
anymore
than
the
habeas
corpus
situation
which
led
the
house
in
outcries
and
really
had
simmered
down
and
much
justice
has
been
done
in
the
light
of
decisions
of
this
court
in
fay
against
noia
and
townsend
against
burke.
i
think
that
the
federal
courts
can
do
the
same
screening
individual
judges
can
look
and
see
whether
claims
are
frivolous
and
refuse
to
have
a
three-judge
court
but
if
the
statute
is
patently
invalid
on
its
face,
the
three-judge
court
should
be
convene
and
should
give
the
relief
that
the
plaintiff
is
entitled
to
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
no,
sir.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
yes,
there
are
number
aspects
to
that.
my
answer
is
yes
with
this
explanation.
first,
if
i
have
review
very
carefully
the
decisions
of
the
california
courts
since
1919
up
to
the
time
the
last
time
they
spoke
on
the
california
--
on
the
criminal
syndicalism
law.
and
the
construction
there
is
broad
and
is
not
restricted
and
does
not
follow
the
constitutional
doctrines
enunciated
by
this
court
interpreting
the
constitution.
i
might
say
following
danskin,
counsel
has
pointed
out
that
danskin
came,
the
issue
was
not
directly
presented
and
all
the
courts
were
simply
saying
if
you're
trying
to
implement
this
criminal
syndicalism
law,
of
course
there
got
to
be
a
clear
and
present
danger
and
of
course
the
american
civil
liberties
union
and
wants
to
use
this
school
auditorium
does
not
express
in
present
danger
and
that
was
it.
but
if
you
read
all
of
the
decisions
as
i
read
it
in
22
and
23
of
my
brief
and
read
the
decision
that
followed
almost
by
10
years
the
decision
in
danskin
and
that
is
black
against
cutter
laboratories
where
mrs.
walker
and
i
quote
from
it
on
page
22,
“was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
whereupon
the
supreme
court
of
california
said
that
constitutes
a
violation
of
the
california
criminal
syndicalism
act
per
se”.
so,
that
you
--
from
the
constructions
they
are
not
limited
and
of
course
the
court
refused
to
pass
on
it
when
we
asked
them
to.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
vogel.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
i
think
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
my
recollection
is
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
yes.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
it
wasn't
on
criminal
syndicalism
or
anything
of
that
kind
but
it
has
some
first
amendment
aspects
of
my
recollection
is
that
i
think
it
had
to
do
something
with
political
activities
of
employees.
they
were
given
the
right
of
some
infringement
along
that
line,
excellent
opinion
and
the
court
felt
indicated
that
supreme
court
was
of
course
concerned
about
the
first
amendment
rights
but
again
the
district
court
down
below
said
counsel
--
the
plaintiff
here
went
to
the
courts
all
the
way
through
and
we
are
bound
not
to
wait
and
validation
that
may
take
a
year
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
no,
no.
it
went
up.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
not
a
decision
but
a
petition
writ
of
prohibition
was
filed
and
the
district
court
of
appeals
was
denied.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
not
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
no
opinion.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
petition
for
hearing.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
yes
under
section
9
but
there,
the
court
held
the
statute
was
constitutional.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
he
wrote
--
not
wrote.
he
issued
a
oral
opinion.
he
said,
i
think
it's
constitutional.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
not
in
the
record
here.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
oh!
yes.
the
documents
were
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
no,
he
--
the
arguments
were
made
as
to
the
invalidity
and
at
length
and
same
arguments
made
or
i
will
say
down
below
great
line
is
placed
on
whitney
by
the
district
attorney.
constantly,
asserting
that
whitney
governed
and
that
should
be
the
end
of
it.
and
the
court
said,
“i
think
it's
constitutional.”
i
think
we
have
to
go
try
it.
and
that's
somewhat
we
saw
at
review.
and
now,
as
to
2283,
i
subscribe
to
the
view
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
no,
that
was
the
point
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
i
think
you
would
probably
get
insurances
from
the
state
that
if
the
judgment
was
affirmed
that
they
would
not
prosecuted
--
i
assume
you
would
get
those
but
down
below
it
was
the
injunction
was
issued
to
assure
the
state
the
right
to
appeal.
i
would
say
that
i
stand
for
the
position
whether
i
needed
it
or
not.
i
stand
for
the
position
that
2283
is
not
about
to
the
grant
of
an
injunction
even
on
appending
case
where
there's
appending
indictment.
i
think
where
there
is
a
declaratory
judgment
for
example
that
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
then
to
effectuate
the
judgment
where
irreparable
injury
is
done
by
the
face
of
the
statute
then
to
effectuate
the
judgment
which
is
another
exception
of
the
2283.
we
should
have
a
right
to
get
whatever
injunctive
relief
we
need.
in
addition,
i
think
history
and
law
would
indicate
that
those
who
passed
the
act
of
1871
the
predecessor
to
1983
must
have
intended
even
if
they
didn't
say
so
that
the
federal
courts
should
have
the
power
to
issue
an
injunction
staying
in
court
--
state
court
proceedings
to
protect
civil
rights
when
those
situations
arose.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
no,
it
wasn't
raised
by
the
(voice
overlap).
mr.
sam
rosenwein
it
wasn't
raised
by
the
other
side.
they
have
raised
it.
they
didn't
raise
it
actually
in
a
jurisdictional
statement
either.
they
have
raised
it
for
the
first
time
here.
well,
for
all
those
reasons,
i
would
urge
the
affirmance
of
the
judgment
below
and
i
think
that
the
act
--
the
criminal
syndicalism
laws
i
might
say
in
the
criminality
laws
ought
to
be
entered
with
the
seditious
liable
laws
and
bad
tendency
test
and
other
relics
of
that
kind.
thank
you.
