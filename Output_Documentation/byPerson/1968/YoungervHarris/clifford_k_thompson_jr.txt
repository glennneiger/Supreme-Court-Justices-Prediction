mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
by
los
angeles
county
district
attorney,
evelle
younger
and
the
people
of
the
state
of
california
from
a
judgment
and
order
of
a
three-judge
district
court
in
the
central
district
of
california
declaring
unconstitutional
on
their
face
each
section
of
the
california
criminal
syndicalism
act,
penal
code
sections
11400
to
11402
and
enjoining
appellant
younger
from
continuing
with
a
pending
prosecution
against
appellee,
john
harris,
jr.
on
september
20,
1966,
appellee
harris
was
indicted
under
section
11401,
sub
3
for
violations
--
two
violations
of
the
syndicalism
act
for
distributing
literature
advocating
crime
as
a
means
of
affecting
political
and
economic
change.
mr.
harris
demurred
to
indictment
and
moved
to
quash
it
in
the
state
courts.
he
sought
a
wrote
--
writ
of
prohibition
in
the
--
an
intermediate
appellate
court
and
petitioned
for
a
hearing
in
the
state
supreme
court.
as
we
will
argue
later
in
none
of
those
cases
that
he
adequately
presented
his
constitutional
issues
to
the
state
appellate
courts
nor
did
he
get
a
determination
even
from
the
trial
court
that
the
statute
was
constitutional
in
a
form
in
which
it
was
approved
here
in
whitney.
in
the
summer
of
1967,
mr.
harris
repaired
to
the
federal
courts
having
--
went
forwarded
in
the
state
courts.
he
was
joined
here
by
three
additional
plaintiffs.
a
temporary
restraining
order
issued
in
august
of
1967,
since
that
time,
this
case
has
languished
in
the
federal
courts,
that
is
over
three
years.
the
district
court
held
that
it
had
jurisdiction
to
pass
on
every
section
of
act
by
reason
of
the
presence
of
mr.
harris
and
appellees
dan
and
hirsh
who
is
members
of
the
progressive
labor
party
urged
that
they
were
inhibited
in
the
peaceful
advocacy
of
that
party’s
program
by
the
act
and
by
the
harris
prosecution.
and
by
the
presence
of
plaintiff
broslawsky
who
is
a
history
teacher
urged
or
alleged
in
his
complaint
that
the
presence
of
the
act
inhibited
him
in
his
customary
practice
of
teaching
about
the
doctrines
of
karl
marx.
the
court
held
that
it
had
jurisdiction
to
review
each
section
of
the
act.
it
held
that
dombrowski
versus
pfister
mandated
a
declaratory
judgment
invalidating
each
and
every
section
of
the
act.
it
further
held
that
the
appellant
younger
should
be
enjoined
from
continuing
with
the
prosecution
which
had
been
started
in
the
state
courts
during
the
preceding
year.
our
contentions
to
this
court
are
these;
first,
that
the
district
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction
to
pass
on
all
sections
of
that
statute
that
--
except
for
the
section
under
which
harris
was
charged,
there
was
no
case
or
controversy
with
respect
to
all
other
sections
of
the
statute.
secondly,
that
the
district
court
abused
its
discretion
by
refraining
from
abstaining
and
by
declaring
the
statute
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
thirdly,
that
the
smith
act
does
not
preempt
the
syndicalism
act.
we
think
that
a
self
evident
proposition
which
requires
no
elaboration
here.
fourthly,
that
the
federal
anti-injunction
statute,
28
u.s.c.
2283
bars
the
injunction
issued
here
against
the
pending
prosecution.
finally,
we
urge
that
the
state
statute
is
constitutional
not
in
the
form
in
which
it
was
approved
in
whitney
or
condemned
in
brandenburg.
we
have
never
urged
that
that
statute
was
constitutional
as
it
appeared
here
in
whitney
but
that
it
is
constitutional
in
light
of
narrowing
state
court
decisions.
it
decided
between
whitney
and
brandenburg.
and
we
would
urge
also
that
if
the
federal
court
disagreed
with
that
that
if
it
chooses
to
interpose
itself
voluntarily
between
state
legislatures
and
state
courts,
there
is
an
obligation
to
act
like
a
state
court
and
to
uphold
that
statute
in
the
manner
in
which
the
federal
district
court
acted
in
the
mackell
case.
to
proceed
then
into
the
jurisdictional
point;
our
proposition
that
the
court
lacked
jurisdiction
with
all
provisions
except
for
11401
sub
3
rests
on
two
propositions.
the
first
is
that
the
mere
existence
of
a
statute
regulating
free
speech
or
association
as
opposed
to
its
enforcement
does
not
exude
such
a
chilling
effect
as
to
give
rise
to
a
case
or
controversy
under
article
3
section
2.
now,
the
resembled
thought
that
dombroski
held
otherwise,
but
that
notion
should
have
been
removed
by
this
court’s
holding
in
golden
against
zwickler
and
subsequently
in
mitchell
against
donovan.
that
we
had
any
other
result
of
course,
federal
courts
would
spend
a
great
deal
of
time
even
more
than
they
now
do
rendering
advisory
opinions
on
rather
troublesome
questions
of
constitutional
law,
many
of
which
in
need
and
now
will
be
litigated.
our
second
proposition
is
that
the
plaintiffs
dan,
hirsch
and
broslawsky
do
not
present
a
case
or
controversy.
now
the
standard
as
articulated
as
recently
as
golden
against
zwickler,
it
--
quoting
of
maryland
casualty
against
pacific
coal
says
the
question
is
whether
under
all
of
the
circumstances
here,
there
is
a
substantial
controversy
between
parties
having
adverse
legal
interests
of
sufficient
immediacy
and
reality
to
warrant
issuance
of
a
declaratory
judgment.
and
we’re
also
mindful
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter’s
pronouncement
in
communist
parties
versus
subversive
activities
control
board
that
mere
potential
impairment
of
constitutional
rights
under
a
statute,
does
not
create
a
justiciable
controversy
in
which
the
nature
and
extent
of
those
rights
maybe
litigated,
that
is
a
standard.
the
allegations
are,
as
i
have
said,
dan
and
hirsch,
as
members
of
the
progressive
labor
party
feel
inhibited
by
the
presence
of
the
act.
mr.
broslawsky
as
a
history
teacher,
somehow
alleges
that
he
is
inhibited
by
the
presence
of
the
act
and
the
prosecution.
we
think
these
allegations
are
frivolous.
we
point
out
that
are
no
overt
acts
by
the
state
or
no
arrests,
no
searches,
no
seizures,
no
accusations,
no
threats
of
prosecution
directed
toward
dan,
toward
hirsch,
toward
browslawsky
or
toward
any
person
who
is
engaged
in
the
similar
kind
of
conduct.
and
we
invite
the
court’s
attention
to
in
effect
the
finding
of
the
district
court,
who
in
their
opinion
did
say,
“we
are
under
no
apprehension
that
dan,
hirsch,
and
browslawsky
stand
in
any
danger
of
prosecution
for
reason
of
the
activities
ascribed
to
themselves
in
their
complaint.”
so
we
think
that
those
allegations
do
not
rise
--
do
not
give
rise
to
a
justiciable
controversy
under
article
3,
section
2.
nor
do
we
think
the
fact
that
the
district
court
has
jurisdiction
to
pass
on
one
section
entitled
it
to
conduct
a
search
and
destroy
mission
in
our
penal
code.
but
first,
that
statute
contains
a
several
authority
clause.
the
legislature
clearly
said,
that
if
it
could
not
have
all
it
wanted,
it
wanted
all
that
it
could
have.
secondly,
it
condemns
different
kinds
of
acts,
not
all
of
the
sub-provisions
are
free
speech
provisions.
11401
sub
1
is
directed
toward
advocacy,
sub-section
3,
towards
circulation
of
literature,
sub-section
4
towards
organizing
and
membership
and
sub-section
5
involves
crimes.
it’s
nothing
to
do
with
speech,
pure
conduct
statute.
yet
the
district
court
felt
that
it
was
warranted
on
passing
--
to
pass
on
all
of
those
statutes.
what
we’re
asking
the
court
to
do
then
is
to
take
the
section
by
section
approach
that
was
done
in
the
smith
act.
we
think
that
any
contrary
view
that
one
--
to
say
that
once
the
district
court
has
its
foot
in
the
door,
it
can
pass
on
everything
in
site,
just
completely
ignored
the
principles
of
justiciability
which
underlies
the
article
3
requirement.
and
an
informed
decision
can
only
result
from
a
case,
which
is
contested
between
people
having
real
interest
and
what
we
have
in
this
case
is
an
uninformed
decision
by
the
district
court,
when
overlooking
a
host
of
state
decisions,
which
are
on
point.
our
second
point
is
that
the
district
court
abused
its
discretion
in
failing
to
abstain
from
declaring
a
statute
unconstitutional.
the
fact
is,
the
district
court
in
one
sense
didn’t
exercise
its
discretion
at
all.
it
didn’t
think
it
had
any.
it
said,
we
may
not
abstain,
because
this
is
a
statute,
which
is
overbroad
and
regulates
free
speech
and
nebraska
tells
us
we
must
act.
our
position
is
that
--
where
we
can
show
the
special
circumstances
present
in
this
case,
there
are
going
to
be
no
finding
of
a
reparable
injury
necessary
to
issue
an
injunction
and
there
is
no
one
for
declaring
a
state’s
statute
unconstitutional.
now,
those
factors
are
these:
number
one
the
state
statue
is
susceptible
of
a
narrowing
construction.
indeed,
our
position
is
that
that
the
construction
was
placed
on
it
as
early
as
1946,
by
a
state
stat
--
by
a
state
decision
by
justice
treanor,
which
we
think
anticipate
it,
but
it
did
not
inspire
the
formulation
of
brandenburg.
secondly,
there
is
a
pending
vehicle,
the
harris
prosecution
which
that
it
is
allowed
to
proceed
in
1970,
that
can
lead
to
the
kind
of
determination
which
resulted
in
the
mackell
case
and
which
will
provide
a
limiting
construction
for
that
statute.
one
which
will
permit
this
court
to
avoid
the
very
difficult
substantive
constitutional
questions,
namely:
what
are
the
federal
limitations
on
state
power?
thirdly,
there
was
an
absence
of
bad
faith
enforcement
in
this
case.
there
were
no
allegations
in
the
complaint,
let
alone
a
demonstration
that
the
state
proceeded
against
mr.
harris,
without
hope
of
convicting
him
simply
to
discourage
him
from
exercising
his
protected
rights.
the
advantages
of
abstention,
i
think
are
many
and
familiar.
first,
if
the
state
court
invalidates
a
statute,
we
avoid
a
direct
federal
front
to
state
sovereignty.
our
state
courts
are
quite
capable
of
doing
that
if
the
constitution
commands
it.
they
did
it
as
recently
as
vogel
against
county
of
los
angeles,
cited
by
the
district
court,
where
they
--
on
the
authority
of
elfbrandt
and
keyishian
invalidated
a
state
employee
loyalty
oath,
which
was
required
by
our
state
constitution.
alternatively,
the
state
court
may
provide
delimiting
construction
which
allows
this
court
and
other
courts
to
avoid
the
substantive
constitutional
issues.
it
avoids
the
kind
of
delay
we’ve
experienced
in
this
case
or
the
cases
remained
here
for
years.
and
i
recognize
there
are
some
exceptional
circumstances,
but
this
is
not
the
first
case
like
this
to
be
in
the
federal
system
for
three
years.
bailey
against
patterson
is
another
example
of
such
a
delay.
this
court’s
calendar
today
i
think
illustrates
the
increased
burden
on
the
federal
courts
which
result
from
an
interventionist
position.
that
burden
should
be
transferred
to
the
state
courts,
among
other
reasons,
that
will
encourage
them
to
assume
a
full
responsibility
for
protecting
federal
rights
and
not
to
advocate
the
field
on
the
assumption
that
we
don’t
handle
it,
we
conduct
it
--
the
federal
courts
will
have
to
resolve
it.
and
finally,
well,
not
finally,
and
ultimately,
state
courts
are
--
now
they
are
the
ultimate
arbiters
of
state
law,
they
are
the
best
arbiters.
they
are
more
familiar
with
it,
they
know
what
their
doing.
this
opinion
has
to
be
a
very
cogent
example
of
that
principle.
finally,
there
is
a
--
perhaps
a
somewhat
novel
consideration
that
we
urge.
in
our
view,
the
abstention
doctrine
and
the
no
rewriting
maxim
that
is
that
this
court
and
federal
courts
do
not
have
the
obligation
to
construe
states
statutes
to
the
extent
they
must
construe
federal
statutes
are
doctrines
which
have
to
coexist
or
cannot
exist
at
all,
both
were
authored
by
justice
frankfurter.
the
no
rewriting
maxim
is
a
--
in
a
sense
a
luxury
and
it
can
only
be
enjoyed
because
of
abstention.
if
you
abandon
the
abstention
doctrine,
then
you
have
to
assume
the
responsibility
for
acting
like
a
state
court
and
doing
what
the
state
court
would
do
to
save
its
statute.
we
think
that
is
implicit
in
the
--
your
court’s
language
in
fox
against
washington.
so
in
a
sense,
the
abstention
then
confers
another
benefit.
it
allows
you
to
avoid
that
very
difficult
responsibility.
we
proceed
then
to
the
special
circumstances
which
we
think
mandate
abstention
in
this
case.
now,
as
to
the
susceptibility
of
this
statute
to
a
saving
construction,
first,
the
guidelines
for
that
construction
have
already
been
provided
in
this
court’s
opinion,
in
brandenburg
against
ohio
and
in
the
smith
act
cases,
dennis,
yates,
scales
and
noto.
secondly,
there
could
be
no
doubt
but
what
the
california
courts
would
faithfully
apply
that
guidance.
the
district
court
recognized
that
when
it
said
that
california
courts
regularly
have
shown
full
alertness
to
the
constitutional
requirements
and
to
the
decisions
of
this
court.
in
effect,
our
statute
comes
before
this
court
in
the
same
posture
that
the
smith
act
did
and
that
was
susceptible
of
a
limiting
construction.
however,
we
think
that
ours
has
even
been
more
limited.
as
to
the
bad
faith
aspect,
unquestionably
a
showing
of
bad
faith
enforcement
is
essential
to
demonstrate
the
irreparable
injury
necessary
to
warrant
injunctive
relief.
now,
we
have
injunctive
relief
here
and
bad
faith
was
not
shown.
but
we
think
that
it's
also
a
circumstance
to
be
considered
on
the
question
of
the
declaratory
judgment.
where
the
statute
is
vague,
it
offers
a
possibility
that
state
officials
may
take
advantage
of
that
vagueness
so
as
to
expand
the
scope
of
the
statute,
to
include
protective
conduct,
which
they
personally
disfavor.
when
that
occurs,
abstention
may
be
mandated.
it
did
not
happen
here
as
it
happened
in
dombrowski.
we
do
not
have
the
arrest,
search
and
seizures,
the
futile
attempt
to
vindicate
state
rights
--
federal
rights
in
the
state
courts
as
occurred
in
louisiana
in
our
case,
none
of
that
is
present
here.
we
think
this
court
has
recognized
this,
albeit
somewhat
cryptically
in
the
affirmances
in
brooks
against
briley
and
wells
against
reynolds.
particularly,
the
wells
case;
that
involved
the
district
court’s
determination
not
to
declare
unconstitutional
the
georgia
statute
denouncing
circulation
of
in-surrectionary
papers
on
the
grounds
that
the
statute
could
be
construed
narrowly
so
as
to
save
it
from
constitutional
objection
and
because
of
an
absence
of
bad
faith.
that
holding
was
affirmed.
now,
we
recognize
that
this
court
in
zwickler
against
koota,
to
a
sharp
dichotomy
between
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
and
to
a
certain
extent
we’re
urging
and
we
do
not
hesitate
to
urge,
the
assimilation
of
a
test
for
those
two.
we
agree
with
the
language
of
mr.
justice
douglas
in
his
dissent
in
mitchell
against
donovan.
ordinarily,
a
declaratory
judgment
of
validating
a
state’s
statute
does
in
fact
result
in
precisely
the
same
quantum
of
interference
and
disruption
of
state
proceedings
as
does
as
an
injunction.
if
that
is
true,
then
the
criteria
for
determining
whether
you
have
a
declaratory
judgment
or
an
injunction
ought
to
be
the
same
and
if
that
requires
a
reconsideration
of
zwickler
then
that’s
valid.
we
think
that
the
--
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
no.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
no
your
honor,
i’m
saying
that
the
statute
reflects
a
policy
of
non-interference
with
the
states.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
that’s
right.
now
to
say
that
that
the
statute
satisfies
the
relationship
between
the
states
and
the
federal
government,
because
the
court
only
issues
a
declaratory
judgment,
instead
of
an
injunction,
it’s
not
that
the
final
exultation
of
form
over
substance.
we
have
been
without
the
statute
for
all
practical
purposes
for
three
years.
there
has
been
no
injunction
against
future
prosecutions,
only
against
the
prosecution
of
appellee
harris,
but
we
haven’t
got
our
statute.
now,
we
think
if
the
--
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
well,
i
think
justice
stewart
if
you
read
the
california
papers
and
follow
the
almost
daily
bombings
and
police
assassinations
and
other
things
and
we’re
familiar
--
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
yeah,
they
punish
it
once
it
has
occurred.
the
problem
is
that
not
only
in
california,
but
in
the
--
but
in
new
york
and
other
states,
it’s
quite
obvious
that
statutes
which
punish
conduct
like
that
which
has
already
occurred
are
not
enough
to
do
the
job,
there’s
no
question
about
that.
if
you
--
i
mean,
if
you’ve
got
to
wait,
you
know,
until
the
breach
has
occurred,
then
it’s
hopeless
and
the
enforcement
is
really
helpless,
we
just
have
to
weigh
them
out
and
accept
whatever
punishment
is
going
to
be
dealt
out
which
is
going
to
be
considerable.
now,
the
third
factor
is
that
in
this
case,
unlike
many
of
the
cases,
there
is
a
pending
vehicle
in
which
the
statute
can
be
construed.
that
wasn’t
true
in
keyishian,
it
wasn’t
true
in
zwickler,
and
it
wasn’t
true
in
a
lot
of
cases
where
abstention
was
deemed
to
be
inappropriate.
now
the
appellee
has
taken
a
position
that
in
fact
this
is
not
at
all
abstention
case.
but
the
state
courts
either
did
pass
on
the
merits
of
the
statute
or
had
an
opportunity
and
failed
to
do
so
and
therefore,
if
the
federal
court
refrained
from
declaring
our
statute
unconstitutional,
it
would
be
abdication
rather
than
abstention.
i
want
to
answer
that
because
it
is
not
in
the
briefs
and
it
was
not
until
re-argument
last
term
that
we
understood
that
there
had
been
a
mutual
misapprehension
of
the
state
law
on
that
point.
in
this
state
trial
court,
mr.
harris
demurred
the
indictment
and
he
moved
to
quash
the
indictment,
under
penal
code
section
995.
the
state
trial
court
said,
“the
motion
quash
is
denied
and
the
demur
is
overruled,
the
statute
is
constitutional.”
but
the
state
trial
court
had
before
it,
memoranda
referring
to
scales,
dennis,
gates,
and
some
california
decisions,
so
its
determination
which
obtained
only
to
the
one
section
under
which
harris
was
charged
was
not
a
finding
that
the
statute
was
a
constitutional
as
it
appeared
here
on
whitney,
but
in
light
of
it
we
think
the
constructions
that
could
be
placed
on
it.
and
when
the
state
trial
court
if
it
ever
gets
to
the
point
where
it
can
issue
instructions
to
the
jury
that
is
where
we
will
find
reflection
of
the
judicial
gloss.
at
all
events,
mr.
harris
then
appealed
to
the
intermediate,
sought
a
writ
of
prohibition
from
the
intermediate
appellate
court
pursuant
to
penal
code
section
99
(a).
we
have
two
writs
of
prohibition
in
california,
one
is
a
99
--
9
(a)
writ,
the
other
was
a
civil
code,
a
procedure
1102
writ.
the
former
is
--
does
nothing
but
give
an
accused
an
opportunity
to
have
an
appellate
court
review
a
superior
court’s
determination
on
the
question
of
probable
cause.
is
there
a
sufficient
quantum
of
evidence
to
make
the
man
go
to
trial?
that
is
all.
it
does
not
raise
constitutional
issues.
harris’
complaint
reflects
that
he
proceeded
with
that
vehicle.
so,
what
he
is
saying
is
the
federal
courts
cannot
abstain
because
i
presented
--
i
selected,
i
elected
the
wrong
remedy
in
the
state
courts,
i
wish
to
present
my
constitutional
claims.
he
then
proceeded
to
the
california
supreme
court
with
a
petition
for
a
hearing,
it
was
denied.
that
is
discretionary,
there
is
no
question
about
that
and
if
he
had
selected
the
correct
remedy,
the
writ
of
prohibition
provided
for
by
1102.
our
position
is
that
that
also
would
have
been
discretionary.
it
is
certainly
clear
that
a
ruling
out
of
denial
or
a
writ
of
prohibition
is
not
a
ruling
on
the
merits
in
california.
now,
the
scope
of
discretion
in
a
state
court,
on
a
writ
of
prohibition,
under
1102
is
something
of
a
murky
question.
no
one
really
is
clear
and
i
don’t
know
if
the
state
courts
are,
but
we
think
the
obscurity
of
that
question
should
demonstrate
to
this
court
that
for
federal
courts
either
to
say
abstention
is
proper
or
improper,
according
to
whether
the
man
is
presented
--
the
constitutional
claim
in
a
pretrial
setting
is
only
to
enmesh
the
federal
courts
and
determinations
are
very
difficult
sometimes,
very
difficult,
questions
of
state
procedural
law,
they
ought
not
to
do
it.
that
it’s
not
a
proper
basis
at
all.
and
finally,
we
arrive
at
the
anti-injunction
statute.
after
atlantic
coastline,
last
term,
they
can
no
longer
--
the
federal
district
court
no
longer
can
enjoin
a
pending
prosecution
in
spite
of
the
statute
on
the
theory
that
it's
merely
a
legislative
enactment
of
the
comity
principle.
it
must
bring
it
within
a
specific
exception.
now,
here
it’s
clear
that
the
district
court
did
not
enter
its
injunction
against
mr.
younger,
in
aid
of
its
jurisdiction
or
effectuated
judgment.
in
fact,
it
told
us
why
it
did,
that
was
ensure
that
we
would
have
an
appeal
to
this
court
under
1253.
of
course,
we
could
have
done
that
by
simply
enjoying
future
prosecutions,
which
would
be
tolerable
under
dombrowski
and
camara,
but
it
did
not.
so,
the
question
then
becomes
whether
or
not
this
injunction
could
be
justified,
because
a
suit
is
under
the
civil
rights
act
and
whether
1983,
42
u.s.c
1983
is
a
specific
exception
to
2283.
our
position
is
that
isn’t,
but
if
it
were,
it
will
be
such
a
massive
exception,
as
to
engulf
the
rule.
and
you
have
a
situation
where
state
court
prosecutions
could
be
interrupted
while
defendants
head
to
the
federal
courts
for
almost
any
alleged
violation
of
due
process.
it's
hard
to
know
where
they
would
stop.
so
we
think
that
the
language
of
that
statute
which
is
rather
plain
means
what
it
says
and
bars
this
injunction.
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
itself,
i
would
repeat,
the
act
is
not
before
this
court
in
the
form
in
which
it
appeared
in
the
whitney
case.
brandenburg
does
not
dispose
of
the
merits
of
this
case.
our
position
is
that
our
statute
has
been
construed
by
our
state
courts
to
conform
to
the
requirements
of
brandenburg.
in
1946,
chief
justice
treanor
said
that
criminal
syndicalism
act
can
be
applied
only
when
there
is
imminent
danger
that
the
advocacy
of
the
doctrines
that
seeks
to
prohibit
will
give
rise
to
the
evils
that
the
state
may
prevent.
we
think
that
was
the
inspiration
for
the
test
in
brandenburg,
certainly
it
satisfies
it.
of
course
the
words
of
justice
treanor
are
as
much
a
part
of
that
statute
as
if
our
legislature
had
put
them
in
there.
this
court
recognized
that
principle
in
winters
against
new
york
and
albert
against
mallard.
in
1920,
we
had
a
decision
in
people
versus
maryland.
that
case
said
that
you
had
to
intend
the
unlawful
consequences,
result
from
your
advocacy.
it
was
a
literature
case.
in
fact
it
involved
the
very
section
at
issue
in
the
district
court
proceeding.
it
was
of
course
not
cited
or
referred
to
by
the
district
court.
it
did
say
that
the
person
distributing
literature
has
to
know
that
content
of
a
literature
and
he
must
intend
the
consequences,
reasonably
attributable
to
his
act
of
distribution.
subsection
4
is
the
organization
and
membership
section.
these
are
discrete
acts.
you
cannot
organize
and
that’s
construed
now
in
california,
it
means
you
have
to
be
on
the
ground
floor.
this
court
recognized
that
in
yates,
you
cannot
organize
an
organization
without
being
active
in
it,
and
without
having
enough
knowledge
and
intention
that
its
unlawful
purposes
be
fulfilled.
by
no
stretch
of
imagination,
is
that
a
status
crime?
requirements
of
active
membership,
it
goes
beyond
requirements
of
active
membership
set
down
in
scales
and
similar
statutes.
well
we
think
that
section
and
the
others
are
constitutional.
and
finally
just
to
reiterate
that
if
a
federal
court
reaches
those,
if
it
chooses
to
interpose
itself
between
the
state
court
and
the
state
legislature
that
it
has
responsibility
to
do
to
the
statute
what
the
state
court
thinks
it
would
do.
that
responsibility
was
discharged
by
the
new
york
court,
it
was
not
here.
we
do
not
--
we
are
just
unable
to
reconcile
those
results.
we
don’t
think
that
there’s
sufficient
discretion
reposes
in
the
district
courts
to
reach
those
opposite
results
and
if
their
discretion
is
that
wide
then
its
discretion
is
simply
a
softer
word
for
arbitrary.
thank
you.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice,
i’d
like
to
make
two
points.
i
think
there
is
an
illuminating
passage
in
the
district
court’s
opinion.
it’s
the
last
whole
paragraph.
the
district
court
tells
us,
“we
believe
that
our
declaration
that
the
act
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
is
all
the
relief
that
is
necessary
to
be
accorded
to
plaintiffs,
that’s
plural,
at
this
time
in
as
much
as
we
are
confident
that
while
this
decision
stands,
the
defendant
would
adhere
to
it
and
would
refrain
from
further
prosecutions
under
the
act.”
in
the
preceding
paragraph,
the
court
says,
“nor
do
we
imply
the
existence
of
a
likelihood
that
the
courts
of
california
would
entertain
such
prosecutions
if
instituted.”
i
think
we
should
take
the
district
court’s
word
for
it
that
they
did
not
need
to
enter
that
injunction
in
order
to
protect
either
their
jurisdiction
or
to
effectuate
their
judgment.
they
were
quite
clear
about
that
and
they
were
equally
clear
about
how
many
plaintiffs
they
had
before
them.
they
referred
to
plaintiffs
in
the
plural
in
their
injunctive
order
which
on
its
face
tells
us
that
the
state
statute
is
unconstitutional,
the
order
appeals
from.
now
i
--
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
precisely.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
yes
it
is.
i
think
that
--
however,
the
district
court
would
be
quite
surprised
if
they
found
that
they
had
given
inadequate
relief
to
all
of
the
plaintiffs
before
them.
and
i
think
they
felt
that
there
was
no
way
to
separate
the
two
questions
of
propriety
of
injunctive
relief
and
declaratory
relief
because
under
dombrowski,
in
order
to
determine
the
procedural
question
or
whether
or
not
to
intervene,
you
must
first
pass
on
a
substantive
question.
the
determine
--
determination
of
intervention
or
abstention
is
the
road
of
judgment
which
is
an
extraordinary
--
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
i
understand
your
honor.
on
--
or
it
may
--
well,
i
hope
that
we
haven’t
wasted
three
years
here.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
i
understand
but
i
would
reiterate
that
it
really
--
that
the
--
unless
we
have
relief
on
the
declaratory
aspect,
then
what
happens
--
we
think
on
the
injunctive
aspect
as
it
is
quite
moot.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
by
los
angeles
county
district
attorney,
evelle
younger
and
the
people
of
the
state
of
california
from
a
judgment
and
order
of
a
three-judge
district
court
in
the
central
district
of
california
declaring
unconstitutional
on
their
face
each
section
of
the
california
criminal
syndicalism
act,
penal
code
sections
11400
to
11402
and
enjoining
appellant
younger
from
continuing
with
a
pending
prosecution
against
appellee,
john
harris,
jr.
on
september
20,
1966,
appellee
harris
was
indicted
under
section
11401,
sub
3
for
violations
--
two
violations
of
the
syndicalism
act
for
distributing
literature
advocating
crime
as
a
means
of
affecting
political
and
economic
change.
mr.
harris
demurred
to
indictment
and
moved
to
quash
it
in
the
state
courts.
he
sought
a
wrote
--
writ
of
prohibition
in
the
--
an
intermediate
appellate
court
and
petitioned
for
a
hearing
in
the
state
supreme
court.
as
we
will
argue
later
in
none
of
those
cases
that
he
adequately
presented
his
constitutional
issues
to
the
state
appellate
courts
nor
did
he
get
a
determination
even
from
the
trial
court
that
the
statute
was
constitutional
in
a
form
in
which
it
was
approved
here
in
whitney.
in
the
summer
of
1967,
mr.
harris
repaired
to
the
federal
courts
having
--
went
forwarded
in
the
state
courts.
he
was
joined
here
by
three
additional
plaintiffs.
a
temporary
restraining
order
issued
in
august
of
1967,
since
that
time,
this
case
has
languished
in
the
federal
courts,
that
is
over
three
years.
the
district
court
held
that
it
had
jurisdiction
to
pass
on
every
section
of
act
by
reason
of
the
presence
of
mr.
harris
and
appellees
dan
and
hirsh
who
is
members
of
the
progressive
labor
party
urged
that
they
were
inhibited
in
the
peaceful
advocacy
of
that
party’s
program
by
the
act
and
by
the
harris
prosecution.
and
by
the
presence
of
plaintiff
broslawsky
who
is
a
history
teacher
urged
or
alleged
in
his
complaint
that
the
presence
of
the
act
inhibited
him
in
his
customary
practice
of
teaching
about
the
doctrines
of
karl
marx.
the
court
held
that
it
had
jurisdiction
to
review
each
section
of
the
act.
it
held
that
dombrowski
versus
pfister
mandated
a
declaratory
judgment
invalidating
each
and
every
section
of
the
act.
it
further
held
that
the
appellant
younger
should
be
enjoined
from
continuing
with
the
prosecution
which
had
been
started
in
the
state
courts
during
the
preceding
year.
our
contentions
to
this
court
are
these;
first,
that
the
district
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction
to
pass
on
all
sections
of
that
statute
that
--
except
for
the
section
under
which
harris
was
charged,
there
was
no
case
or
controversy
with
respect
to
all
other
sections
of
the
statute.
secondly,
that
the
district
court
abused
its
discretion
by
refraining
from
abstaining
and
by
declaring
the
statute
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
thirdly,
that
the
smith
act
does
not
preempt
the
syndicalism
act.
we
think
that
a
self
evident
proposition
which
requires
no
elaboration
here.
fourthly,
that
the
federal
anti-injunction
statute,
28
u.s.c.
2283
bars
the
injunction
issued
here
against
the
pending
prosecution.
finally,
we
urge
that
the
state
statute
is
constitutional
not
in
the
form
in
which
it
was
approved
in
whitney
or
condemned
in
brandenburg.
we
have
never
urged
that
that
statute
was
constitutional
as
it
appeared
here
in
whitney
but
that
it
is
constitutional
in
light
of
narrowing
state
court
decisions.
it
decided
between
whitney
and
brandenburg.
and
we
would
urge
also
that
if
the
federal
court
disagreed
with
that
that
if
it
chooses
to
interpose
itself
voluntarily
between
state
legislatures
and
state
courts,
there
is
an
obligation
to
act
like
a
state
court
and
to
uphold
that
statute
in
the
manner
in
which
the
federal
district
court
acted
in
the
mackell
case.
to
proceed
then
into
the
jurisdictional
point;
our
proposition
that
the
court
lacked
jurisdiction
with
all
provisions
except
for
11401
sub
3
rests
on
two
propositions.
the
first
is
that
the
mere
existence
of
a
statute
regulating
free
speech
or
association
as
opposed
to
its
enforcement
does
not
exude
such
a
chilling
effect
as
to
give
rise
to
a
case
or
controversy
under
article
3
section
2.
now,
the
resembled
thought
that
dombroski
held
otherwise,
but
that
notion
should
have
been
removed
by
this
court’s
holding
in
golden
against
zwickler
and
subsequently
in
mitchell
against
donovan.
that
we
had
any
other
result
of
course,
federal
courts
would
spend
a
great
deal
of
time
even
more
than
they
now
do
rendering
advisory
opinions
on
rather
troublesome
questions
of
constitutional
law,
many
of
which
in
need
and
now
will
be
litigated.
our
second
proposition
is
that
the
plaintiffs
dan,
hirsch
and
broslawsky
do
not
present
a
case
or
controversy.
now
the
standard
as
articulated
as
recently
as
golden
against
zwickler,
it
--
quoting
of
maryland
casualty
against
pacific
coal
says
the
question
is
whether
under
all
of
the
circumstances
here,
there
is
a
substantial
controversy
between
parties
having
adverse
legal
interests
of
sufficient
immediacy
and
reality
to
warrant
issuance
of
a
declaratory
judgment.
and
we’re
also
mindful
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter’s
pronouncement
in
communist
parties
versus
subversive
activities
control
board
that
mere
potential
impairment
of
constitutional
rights
under
a
statute,
does
not
create
a
justiciable
controversy
in
which
the
nature
and
extent
of
those
rights
maybe
litigated,
that
is
a
standard.
the
allegations
are,
as
i
have
said,
dan
and
hirsch,
as
members
of
the
progressive
labor
party
feel
inhibited
by
the
presence
of
the
act.
mr.
broslawsky
as
a
history
teacher,
somehow
alleges
that
he
is
inhibited
by
the
presence
of
the
act
and
the
prosecution.
we
think
these
allegations
are
frivolous.
we
point
out
that
are
no
overt
acts
by
the
state
or
no
arrests,
no
searches,
no
seizures,
no
accusations,
no
threats
of
prosecution
directed
toward
dan,
toward
hirsch,
toward
browslawsky
or
toward
any
person
who
is
engaged
in
the
similar
kind
of
conduct.
and
we
invite
the
court’s
attention
to
in
effect
the
finding
of
the
district
court,
who
in
their
opinion
did
say,
“we
are
under
no
apprehension
that
dan,
hirsch,
and
browslawsky
stand
in
any
danger
of
prosecution
for
reason
of
the
activities
ascribed
to
themselves
in
their
complaint.”
so
we
think
that
those
allegations
do
not
rise
--
do
not
give
rise
to
a
justiciable
controversy
under
article
3,
section
2.
nor
do
we
think
the
fact
that
the
district
court
has
jurisdiction
to
pass
on
one
section
entitled
it
to
conduct
a
search
and
destroy
mission
in
our
penal
code.
but
first,
that
statute
contains
a
several
authority
clause.
the
legislature
clearly
said,
that
if
it
could
not
have
all
it
wanted,
it
wanted
all
that
it
could
have.
secondly,
it
condemns
different
kinds
of
acts,
not
all
of
the
sub-provisions
are
free
speech
provisions.
11401
sub
1
is
directed
toward
advocacy,
sub-section
3,
towards
circulation
of
literature,
sub-section
4
towards
organizing
and
membership
and
sub-section
5
involves
crimes.
it’s
nothing
to
do
with
speech,
pure
conduct
statute.
yet
the
district
court
felt
that
it
was
warranted
on
passing
--
to
pass
on
all
of
those
statutes.
what
we’re
asking
the
court
to
do
then
is
to
take
the
section
by
section
approach
that
was
done
in
the
smith
act.
we
think
that
any
contrary
view
that
one
--
to
say
that
once
the
district
court
has
its
foot
in
the
door,
it
can
pass
on
everything
in
site,
just
completely
ignored
the
principles
of
justiciability
which
underlies
the
article
3
requirement.
and
an
informed
decision
can
only
result
from
a
case,
which
is
contested
between
people
having
real
interest
and
what
we
have
in
this
case
is
an
uninformed
decision
by
the
district
court,
when
overlooking
a
host
of
state
decisions,
which
are
on
point.
our
second
point
is
that
the
district
court
abused
its
discretion
in
failing
to
abstain
from
declaring
a
statute
unconstitutional.
the
fact
is,
the
district
court
in
one
sense
didn’t
exercise
its
discretion
at
all.
it
didn’t
think
it
had
any.
it
said,
we
may
not
abstain,
because
this
is
a
statute,
which
is
overbroad
and
regulates
free
speech
and
nebraska
tells
us
we
must
act.
our
position
is
that
--
where
we
can
show
the
special
circumstances
present
in
this
case,
there
are
going
to
be
no
finding
of
a
reparable
injury
necessary
to
issue
an
injunction
and
there
is
no
one
for
declaring
a
state’s
statute
unconstitutional.
now,
those
factors
are
these:
number
one
the
state
statue
is
susceptible
of
a
narrowing
construction.
indeed,
our
position
is
that
that
the
construction
was
placed
on
it
as
early
as
1946,
by
a
state
stat
--
by
a
state
decision
by
justice
treanor,
which
we
think
anticipate
it,
but
it
did
not
inspire
the
formulation
of
brandenburg.
secondly,
there
is
a
pending
vehicle,
the
harris
prosecution
which
that
it
is
allowed
to
proceed
in
1970,
that
can
lead
to
the
kind
of
determination
which
resulted
in
the
mackell
case
and
which
will
provide
a
limiting
construction
for
that
statute.
one
which
will
permit
this
court
to
avoid
the
very
difficult
substantive
constitutional
questions,
namely:
what
are
the
federal
limitations
on
state
power?
thirdly,
there
was
an
absence
of
bad
faith
enforcement
in
this
case.
there
were
no
allegations
in
the
complaint,
let
alone
a
demonstration
that
the
state
proceeded
against
mr.
harris,
without
hope
of
convicting
him
simply
to
discourage
him
from
exercising
his
protected
rights.
the
advantages
of
abstention,
i
think
are
many
and
familiar.
first,
if
the
state
court
invalidates
a
statute,
we
avoid
a
direct
federal
front
to
state
sovereignty.
our
state
courts
are
quite
capable
of
doing
that
if
the
constitution
commands
it.
they
did
it
as
recently
as
vogel
against
county
of
los
angeles,
cited
by
the
district
court,
where
they
--
on
the
authority
of
elfbrandt
and
keyishian
invalidated
a
state
employee
loyalty
oath,
which
was
required
by
our
state
constitution.
alternatively,
the
state
court
may
provide
delimiting
construction
which
allows
this
court
and
other
courts
to
avoid
the
substantive
constitutional
issues.
it
avoids
the
kind
of
delay
we’ve
experienced
in
this
case
or
the
cases
remained
here
for
years.
and
i
recognize
there
are
some
exceptional
circumstances,
but
this
is
not
the
first
case
like
this
to
be
in
the
federal
system
for
three
years.
bailey
against
patterson
is
another
example
of
such
a
delay.
this
court’s
calendar
today
i
think
illustrates
the
increased
burden
on
the
federal
courts
which
result
from
an
interventionist
position.
that
burden
should
be
transferred
to
the
state
courts,
among
other
reasons,
that
will
encourage
them
to
assume
a
full
responsibility
for
protecting
federal
rights
and
not
to
advocate
the
field
on
the
assumption
that
we
don’t
handle
it,
we
conduct
it
--
the
federal
courts
will
have
to
resolve
it.
and
finally,
well,
not
finally,
and
ultimately,
state
courts
are
--
now
they
are
the
ultimate
arbiters
of
state
law,
they
are
the
best
arbiters.
they
are
more
familiar
with
it,
they
know
what
their
doing.
this
opinion
has
to
be
a
very
cogent
example
of
that
principle.
finally,
there
is
a
--
perhaps
a
somewhat
novel
consideration
that
we
urge.
in
our
view,
the
abstention
doctrine
and
the
no
rewriting
maxim
that
is
that
this
court
and
federal
courts
do
not
have
the
obligation
to
construe
states
statutes
to
the
extent
they
must
construe
federal
statutes
are
doctrines
which
have
to
coexist
or
cannot
exist
at
all,
both
were
authored
by
justice
frankfurter.
the
no
rewriting
maxim
is
a
--
in
a
sense
a
luxury
and
it
can
only
be
enjoyed
because
of
abstention.
if
you
abandon
the
abstention
doctrine,
then
you
have
to
assume
the
responsibility
for
acting
like
a
state
court
and
doing
what
the
state
court
would
do
to
save
its
statute.
we
think
that
is
implicit
in
the
--
your
court’s
language
in
fox
against
washington.
so
in
a
sense,
the
abstention
then
confers
another
benefit.
it
allows
you
to
avoid
that
very
difficult
responsibility.
we
proceed
then
to
the
special
circumstances
which
we
think
mandate
abstention
in
this
case.
now,
as
to
the
susceptibility
of
this
statute
to
a
saving
construction,
first,
the
guidelines
for
that
construction
have
already
been
provided
in
this
court’s
opinion,
in
brandenburg
against
ohio
and
in
the
smith
act
cases,
dennis,
yates,
scales
and
noto.
secondly,
there
could
be
no
doubt
but
what
the
california
courts
would
faithfully
apply
that
guidance.
the
district
court
recognized
that
when
it
said
that
california
courts
regularly
have
shown
full
alertness
to
the
constitutional
requirements
and
to
the
decisions
of
this
court.
in
effect,
our
statute
comes
before
this
court
in
the
same
posture
that
the
smith
act
did
and
that
was
susceptible
of
a
limiting
construction.
however,
we
think
that
ours
has
even
been
more
limited.
as
to
the
bad
faith
aspect,
unquestionably
a
showing
of
bad
faith
enforcement
is
essential
to
demonstrate
the
irreparable
injury
necessary
to
warrant
injunctive
relief.
now,
we
have
injunctive
relief
here
and
bad
faith
was
not
shown.
but
we
think
that
it's
also
a
circumstance
to
be
considered
on
the
question
of
the
declaratory
judgment.
where
the
statute
is
vague,
it
offers
a
possibility
that
state
officials
may
take
advantage
of
that
vagueness
so
as
to
expand
the
scope
of
the
statute,
to
include
protective
conduct,
which
they
personally
disfavor.
when
that
occurs,
abstention
may
be
mandated.
it
did
not
happen
here
as
it
happened
in
dombrowski.
we
do
not
have
the
arrest,
search
and
seizures,
the
futile
attempt
to
vindicate
state
rights
--
federal
rights
in
the
state
courts
as
occurred
in
louisiana
in
our
case,
none
of
that
is
present
here.
we
think
this
court
has
recognized
this,
albeit
somewhat
cryptically
in
the
affirmances
in
brooks
against
briley
and
wells
against
reynolds.
particularly,
the
wells
case;
that
involved
the
district
court’s
determination
not
to
declare
unconstitutional
the
georgia
statute
denouncing
circulation
of
in-surrectionary
papers
on
the
grounds
that
the
statute
could
be
construed
narrowly
so
as
to
save
it
from
constitutional
objection
and
because
of
an
absence
of
bad
faith.
that
holding
was
affirmed.
now,
we
recognize
that
this
court
in
zwickler
against
koota,
to
a
sharp
dichotomy
between
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
and
to
a
certain
extent
we’re
urging
and
we
do
not
hesitate
to
urge,
the
assimilation
of
a
test
for
those
two.
we
agree
with
the
language
of
mr.
justice
douglas
in
his
dissent
in
mitchell
against
donovan.
ordinarily,
a
declaratory
judgment
of
validating
a
state’s
statute
does
in
fact
result
in
precisely
the
same
quantum
of
interference
and
disruption
of
state
proceedings
as
does
as
an
injunction.
if
that
is
true,
then
the
criteria
for
determining
whether
you
have
a
declaratory
judgment
or
an
injunction
ought
to
be
the
same
and
if
that
requires
a
reconsideration
of
zwickler
then
that’s
valid.
we
think
that
the
--
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
no.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
no
your
honor,
i’m
saying
that
the
statute
reflects
a
policy
of
non-interference
with
the
states.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
that’s
right.
now
to
say
that
that
the
statute
satisfies
the
relationship
between
the
states
and
the
federal
government,
because
the
court
only
issues
a
declaratory
judgment,
instead
of
an
injunction,
it’s
not
that
the
final
exultation
of
form
over
substance.
we
have
been
without
the
statute
for
all
practical
purposes
for
three
years.
there
has
been
no
injunction
against
future
prosecutions,
only
against
the
prosecution
of
appellee
harris,
but
we
haven’t
got
our
statute.
now,
we
think
if
the
--
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
well,
i
think
justice
stewart
if
you
read
the
california
papers
and
follow
the
almost
daily
bombings
and
police
assassinations
and
other
things
and
we’re
familiar
--
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
yeah,
they
punish
it
once
it
has
occurred.
the
problem
is
that
not
only
in
california,
but
in
the
--
but
in
new
york
and
other
states,
it’s
quite
obvious
that
statutes
which
punish
conduct
like
that
which
has
already
occurred
are
not
enough
to
do
the
job,
there’s
no
question
about
that.
if
you
--
i
mean,
if
you’ve
got
to
wait,
you
know,
until
the
breach
has
occurred,
then
it’s
hopeless
and
the
enforcement
is
really
helpless,
we
just
have
to
weigh
them
out
and
accept
whatever
punishment
is
going
to
be
dealt
out
which
is
going
to
be
considerable.
now,
the
third
factor
is
that
in
this
case,
unlike
many
of
the
cases,
there
is
a
pending
vehicle
in
which
the
statute
can
be
construed.
that
wasn’t
true
in
keyishian,
it
wasn’t
true
in
zwickler,
and
it
wasn’t
true
in
a
lot
of
cases
where
abstention
was
deemed
to
be
inappropriate.
now
the
appellee
has
taken
a
position
that
in
fact
this
is
not
at
all
abstention
case.
but
the
state
courts
either
did
pass
on
the
merits
of
the
statute
or
had
an
opportunity
and
failed
to
do
so
and
therefore,
if
the
federal
court
refrained
from
declaring
our
statute
unconstitutional,
it
would
be
abdication
rather
than
abstention.
i
want
to
answer
that
because
it
is
not
in
the
briefs
and
it
was
not
until
re-argument
last
term
that
we
understood
that
there
had
been
a
mutual
misapprehension
of
the
state
law
on
that
point.
in
this
state
trial
court,
mr.
harris
demurred
the
indictment
and
he
moved
to
quash
the
indictment,
under
penal
code
section
995.
the
state
trial
court
said,
“the
motion
quash
is
denied
and
the
demur
is
overruled,
the
statute
is
constitutional.”
but
the
state
trial
court
had
before
it,
memoranda
referring
to
scales,
dennis,
gates,
and
some
california
decisions,
so
its
determination
which
obtained
only
to
the
one
section
under
which
harris
was
charged
was
not
a
finding
that
the
statute
was
a
constitutional
as
it
appeared
here
on
whitney,
but
in
light
of
it
we
think
the
constructions
that
could
be
placed
on
it.
and
when
the
state
trial
court
if
it
ever
gets
to
the
point
where
it
can
issue
instructions
to
the
jury
that
is
where
we
will
find
reflection
of
the
judicial
gloss.
at
all
events,
mr.
harris
then
appealed
to
the
intermediate,
sought
a
writ
of
prohibition
from
the
intermediate
appellate
court
pursuant
to
penal
code
section
99
(a).
we
have
two
writs
of
prohibition
in
california,
one
is
a
99
--
9
(a)
writ,
the
other
was
a
civil
code,
a
procedure
1102
writ.
the
former
is
--
does
nothing
but
give
an
accused
an
opportunity
to
have
an
appellate
court
review
a
superior
court’s
determination
on
the
question
of
probable
cause.
is
there
a
sufficient
quantum
of
evidence
to
make
the
man
go
to
trial?
that
is
all.
it
does
not
raise
constitutional
issues.
harris’
complaint
reflects
that
he
proceeded
with
that
vehicle.
so,
what
he
is
saying
is
the
federal
courts
cannot
abstain
because
i
presented
--
i
selected,
i
elected
the
wrong
remedy
in
the
state
courts,
i
wish
to
present
my
constitutional
claims.
he
then
proceeded
to
the
california
supreme
court
with
a
petition
for
a
hearing,
it
was
denied.
that
is
discretionary,
there
is
no
question
about
that
and
if
he
had
selected
the
correct
remedy,
the
writ
of
prohibition
provided
for
by
1102.
our
position
is
that
that
also
would
have
been
discretionary.
it
is
certainly
clear
that
a
ruling
out
of
denial
or
a
writ
of
prohibition
is
not
a
ruling
on
the
merits
in
california.
now,
the
scope
of
discretion
in
a
state
court,
on
a
writ
of
prohibition,
under
1102
is
something
of
a
murky
question.
no
one
really
is
clear
and
i
don’t
know
if
the
state
courts
are,
but
we
think
the
obscurity
of
that
question
should
demonstrate
to
this
court
that
for
federal
courts
either
to
say
abstention
is
proper
or
improper,
according
to
whether
the
man
is
presented
--
the
constitutional
claim
in
a
pretrial
setting
is
only
to
enmesh
the
federal
courts
and
determinations
are
very
difficult
sometimes,
very
difficult,
questions
of
state
procedural
law,
they
ought
not
to
do
it.
that
it’s
not
a
proper
basis
at
all.
and
finally,
we
arrive
at
the
anti-injunction
statute.
after
atlantic
coastline,
last
term,
they
can
no
longer
--
the
federal
district
court
no
longer
can
enjoin
a
pending
prosecution
in
spite
of
the
statute
on
the
theory
that
it's
merely
a
legislative
enactment
of
the
comity
principle.
it
must
bring
it
within
a
specific
exception.
now,
here
it’s
clear
that
the
district
court
did
not
enter
its
injunction
against
mr.
younger,
in
aid
of
its
jurisdiction
or
effectuated
judgment.
in
fact,
it
told
us
why
it
did,
that
was
ensure
that
we
would
have
an
appeal
to
this
court
under
1253.
of
course,
we
could
have
done
that
by
simply
enjoying
future
prosecutions,
which
would
be
tolerable
under
dombrowski
and
camara,
but
it
did
not.
so,
the
question
then
becomes
whether
or
not
this
injunction
could
be
justified,
because
a
suit
is
under
the
civil
rights
act
and
whether
1983,
42
u.s.c
1983
is
a
specific
exception
to
2283.
our
position
is
that
isn’t,
but
if
it
were,
it
will
be
such
a
massive
exception,
as
to
engulf
the
rule.
and
you
have
a
situation
where
state
court
prosecutions
could
be
interrupted
while
defendants
head
to
the
federal
courts
for
almost
any
alleged
violation
of
due
process.
it's
hard
to
know
where
they
would
stop.
so
we
think
that
the
language
of
that
statute
which
is
rather
plain
means
what
it
says
and
bars
this
injunction.
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
itself,
i
would
repeat,
the
act
is
not
before
this
court
in
the
form
in
which
it
appeared
in
the
whitney
case.
brandenburg
does
not
dispose
of
the
merits
of
this
case.
our
position
is
that
our
statute
has
been
construed
by
our
state
courts
to
conform
to
the
requirements
of
brandenburg.
in
1946,
chief
justice
treanor
said
that
criminal
syndicalism
act
can
be
applied
only
when
there
is
imminent
danger
that
the
advocacy
of
the
doctrines
that
seeks
to
prohibit
will
give
rise
to
the
evils
that
the
state
may
prevent.
we
think
that
was
the
inspiration
for
the
test
in
brandenburg,
certainly
it
satisfies
it.
of
course
the
words
of
justice
treanor
are
as
much
a
part
of
that
statute
as
if
our
legislature
had
put
them
in
there.
this
court
recognized
that
principle
in
winters
against
new
york
and
albert
against
mallard.
in
1920,
we
had
a
decision
in
people
versus
maryland.
that
case
said
that
you
had
to
intend
the
unlawful
consequences,
result
from
your
advocacy.
it
was
a
literature
case.
in
fact
it
involved
the
very
section
at
issue
in
the
district
court
proceeding.
it
was
of
course
not
cited
or
referred
to
by
the
district
court.
it
did
say
that
the
person
distributing
literature
has
to
know
that
content
of
a
literature
and
he
must
intend
the
consequences,
reasonably
attributable
to
his
act
of
distribution.
subsection
4
is
the
organization
and
membership
section.
these
are
discrete
acts.
you
cannot
organize
and
that’s
construed
now
in
california,
it
means
you
have
to
be
on
the
ground
floor.
this
court
recognized
that
in
yates,
you
cannot
organize
an
organization
without
being
active
in
it,
and
without
having
enough
knowledge
and
intention
that
its
unlawful
purposes
be
fulfilled.
by
no
stretch
of
imagination,
is
that
a
status
crime?
requirements
of
active
membership,
it
goes
beyond
requirements
of
active
membership
set
down
in
scales
and
similar
statutes.
well
we
think
that
section
and
the
others
are
constitutional.
and
finally
just
to
reiterate
that
if
a
federal
court
reaches
those,
if
it
chooses
to
interpose
itself
between
the
state
court
and
the
state
legislature
that
it
has
responsibility
to
do
to
the
statute
what
the
state
court
thinks
it
would
do.
that
responsibility
was
discharged
by
the
new
york
court,
it
was
not
here.
we
do
not
--
we
are
just
unable
to
reconcile
those
results.
we
don’t
think
that
there’s
sufficient
discretion
reposes
in
the
district
courts
to
reach
those
opposite
results
and
if
their
discretion
is
that
wide
then
its
discretion
is
simply
a
softer
word
for
arbitrary.
thank
you.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice,
i’d
like
to
make
two
points.
i
think
there
is
an
illuminating
passage
in
the
district
court’s
opinion.
it’s
the
last
whole
paragraph.
the
district
court
tells
us,
“we
believe
that
our
declaration
that
the
act
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
is
all
the
relief
that
is
necessary
to
be
accorded
to
plaintiffs,
that’s
plural,
at
this
time
in
as
much
as
we
are
confident
that
while
this
decision
stands,
the
defendant
would
adhere
to
it
and
would
refrain
from
further
prosecutions
under
the
act.”
in
the
preceding
paragraph,
the
court
says,
“nor
do
we
imply
the
existence
of
a
likelihood
that
the
courts
of
california
would
entertain
such
prosecutions
if
instituted.”
i
think
we
should
take
the
district
court’s
word
for
it
that
they
did
not
need
to
enter
that
injunction
in
order
to
protect
either
their
jurisdiction
or
to
effectuate
their
judgment.
they
were
quite
clear
about
that
and
they
were
equally
clear
about
how
many
plaintiffs
they
had
before
them.
they
referred
to
plaintiffs
in
the
plural
in
their
injunctive
order
which
on
its
face
tells
us
that
the
state
statute
is
unconstitutional,
the
order
appeals
from.
now
i
--
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
precisely.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
yes
it
is.
i
think
that
--
however,
the
district
court
would
be
quite
surprised
if
they
found
that
they
had
given
inadequate
relief
to
all
of
the
plaintiffs
before
them.
and
i
think
they
felt
that
there
was
no
way
to
separate
the
two
questions
of
propriety
of
injunctive
relief
and
declaratory
relief
because
under
dombrowski,
in
order
to
determine
the
procedural
question
or
whether
or
not
to
intervene,
you
must
first
pass
on
a
substantive
question.
the
determine
--
determination
of
intervention
or
abstention
is
the
road
of
judgment
which
is
an
extraordinary
--
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
i
understand
your
honor.
on
--
or
it
may
--
well,
i
hope
that
we
haven’t
wasted
three
years
here.
mr.
clifford
k.
thompson,
jr.
i
understand
but
i
would
reiterate
that
it
really
--
that
the
--
unless
we
have
relief
on
the
declaratory
aspect,
then
what
happens
--
we
think
on
the
injunctive
aspect
as
it
is
quite
moot.
thank
you,
your
honors.
