justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
including
the
one
under
indictment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
why
--
i
expect
zwickler
and
koota
as
bearing
in
this
under
declaratory
judgment
aspect
not
only
the
injunction
aspect?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
mr.
harris?
is
that
section
ever
been
the
subject
of
reconstruction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
talk
about
it
as
you'll
get
to
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
was
the
indictment
charged
him
with
printing
or
publishing
or
whatever?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
was
the
purport
of
the
handbills?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me
for
interrupting
you
again
mr.
harris.
you
referred
me
to
something
which
is
said
was
in
the
appendix
to
a
supplemental
brief
in
your
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
got
a
supplemental
brief
in
reargument
referring
that
to
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
guess
i
don't
have
it.
thank
you
mr.
albert.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
harris,
i
don't
seem
to
have
that
indictment
here.
tell
me
what
--
i
don't
have
that
appendix
whatever
it
was.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
seem
to
have
it
either.
what's
the
form
you
have
--
what's
the
form
of
the
indictment
in
relation
to
the
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
language
of
the
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
language
of
the
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
to
say
that
--
then
subsection
3
is
reprinted
in
the
indictment
as
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
the
court
has
now
found
this
matter.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
what
page
is
the
indictment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
what
stage
is
his
first
opportunity
to
get
this
limited
as
you
have
suggested,
you
thought
the
california
courts
would
limit
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
the
clear
and
present
danger
and
so
forth?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
say
that's
tested
by
reference
to
the
grand
jury
minutes?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
suppose
there
was
nothing
whatever
in
the
grand
jury
testimony
would
satisfy
the
ingredient
of
clear
and
present
danger
and
so
forth,
then
what
would
happen?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
wirin.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
anywhere
in
the
appendices
a
record
of
what
you
did
in
proceeding
what
is
called
the
998
(a)
proceeding
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
we
have
it
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
wirin,
i'd
like
to
get
this
clear.
i
gather
your
basic
position
is
that
it
was
appropriate
for
the
federal
district
court
to
intervene
as
it
did.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
if
i
understand
your
argument,
you
had
in
fact
exhausted,
the
special
procedure
and
california
provides
unsuccessfully
to
get
a
determination
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
or
to
get
a
narrowing
construction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
don't
overlook
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
number
of
that
section?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
court
does
that
go
mr.
wirin?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
your
intermediate
appellate
court.
it's
not
that
special
appellate
court
you
have
in
california?
