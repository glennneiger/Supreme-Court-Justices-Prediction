justice
potter
stewart
but
for
now
you're
just
been
dealing
with
those
other
than
harris?
justice
potter
stewart
and
with
respect
to
harris
you're
going
to
argue
the
2283?
justice
potter
stewart
171
p.2d
885?
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be
it.
justice
potter
stewart
the
indictment
doesn't
appear
in
the
appendix
here,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
as
i
understand
the
--
as
i
read
the
complaint
that
plaintiff
harris
says
that
he
was
indicted
for
violating
the
criminal
syndicalism
act
for
distributing
and
circulating
leaflets
bearing
the
imprint
of
progressive
labor
party.
that's
all
he
was
doing
it's
pretty
hard
to
see
how
he
was
violating
the
statute
as
you
say
it's
now
been
authoritatively
construe?
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
he
hasn't
been
tried
yet?
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he
faces
the
possibility
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
writer
of
the
opinion
for
the
three-judge
court
rather
disagree
with
your
prediction.
justice
potter
stewart
let's
just
say
they
stand
--
do
not
stand
in
any
danger
of
prosecution
by
the
respondent.
the
present
district
attorney
of
los
angeles
nor
do
we
imply
the
existence
of
a
livelihood
that
the
courts
of
california
would
entertain
such
prosecutions
if
instituted.
that's
the
language
of
this.
justice
potter
stewart
what's
this
vogel
case
about,
mr.
rosenwein?
justice
potter
stewart
the
one
cited
by
the
three-judge
district
court
by
judge
gray
in
his
opinion
--
justice
potter
stewart
vogel
versus
the
county
of
los
angeles?
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
says
as
an
excellent
example
of
the
california
supreme
court's
correct
constitutional
views
and
he
says
that
decision
has
particular
relevance
to
the
issue
here
at
hand.
justice
potter
stewart
what's
that
about?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
rosenwein,
i
didn't
understand
that
there
was
any
decision
on
the
merits
of
that
motion
beyond
the
trial
court.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
it
was
a
declination
they're
considering.
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
on
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
as
i
understood.
justice
potter
stewart
to
get
a
direct
appeal
here.
justice
potter
stewart
where
did
he
teach
these
subjects?
justice
potter
stewart
was
it
a
regular
part
of
the
curriculum
of
the
course
he
taught?
well,
it's
all
contained
in
about
one
paragraph
in
the
complaint
and
that's
all
we
know
about
it.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
all
you
know.
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
this
appendix
to
the
brief
for
the
appellant
filed
here
on
february
27,
1969?
justice
potter
stewart
“wanted
dead
for
murder”
this
is
the
san
francisco
pig
michael
o'brien?
justice
potter
stewart
the
leaflets
are
distributed
by
your
client
are
supposedly
here
somewhere,
i
don't
--
maybe
unable
to
find
them.
justice
potter
stewart
i
have
found
the
ones
you.
i
found
the
ones
you've
told
us
to
disregard
but
i
haven't
found
the
other.[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
appendix
to
appellee's
supplemental
brief
on
reargument?
justice
potter
stewart
but
mr.
wirin,
you're
not
suggesting
are
you
that
having
exhausted
this
rather
unusual
california
pretrial
procedure.
he
was
that
under
state
law
he
could
not
continue
to
assert
his
constitutional
defense
at
the
criminal
prosecution,
you're
not
suggesting
any
(voice
overlap)?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
now,
he
would
be
in
the
same
position
as
would
be
a
defendant
in
any
other
state
that
did
not
have
any
such
pretrial
procedure
as
california
has,
but
to
me
be
just
be
a
simply
a
defendant
and
having
been
charge
with
the
offense
and
they
were
be
available
to
him
and
the
state
courts
all
of
his
constitutional
defenses,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
insofar
as
you're
relying
on
the
statute,
section
2283,
it
refers
to
an
injunction,
but
not
to
a
declaratory
judgment.
so
you’re
asking
us
to
read
the
statute
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
equate
a
declaratory
judgment
or
injunction?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
the
policy
should
include
declaratory
judgment?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
very
much?[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
good
many
other
statutes
that
cover
that
sort
of
conduct,
i
presume
in
california?
justice
potter
stewart
one
was
a
history
teacher?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
two,
who
were
the
two
others?
justice
potter
stewart
same
party
as
harris?
justice
potter
stewart
and
who
was
the
fourth?
justice
potter
stewart
because,
i
would
think
it
was
a
declaratory
judgment,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
there
have
been
a
demur
to
the
indictment
in
the
state
court,
but
you’re
not
talking
about
that.
justice
potter
stewart
by
the
federal
district?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
order,
i
don’t
have
it
right
here,
but
the
order
only
enjoins
the
prosecution
of
harris,
does
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
your
point
is
that
the
opinion
is
tantamount
to
a
declaratory
judgment
for
the
benefit
of
all
of
the
plaintiffs
as
to
the
unconstitutionality
of
this
act
as
a
whole?
justice
potter
stewart
the
injunction
itself
is
considerably
narrower,
is
it
not
and
that
it
refers
only
to
harris?
justice
potter
stewart
so
i
think
it
was
the
point
mr.
wirin
was
making,
one
of
his
points
at
least
was
simply
that
the
other
three
plaintiffs
were
not
proper
appellees
because
at
the
most
all
they
got
was
a
declaratory
judgment
and
if
you'd
wanted
to
appeal
that,
you
should
have
gone
to
the
court
of
appeals
then
they
would've
been
appellees
there,
that’s
how
i
understood
him,
perhaps
i
misunderstood
him.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
right
--
you're
rightly
here
with
respect
to
mr.
harris.
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you
very
much.
justice
potter
stewart
but
for
now
you're

justice

with

you're

2283?
justice
potter
stewart
171
p.2d
885?
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be
it.
justice
potter
stewart
the

doesn't

does
it?
