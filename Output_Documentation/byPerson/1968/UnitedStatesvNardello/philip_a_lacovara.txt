mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
which
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
grows
out
of
the
efforts
to
uncover
and
prosecute
the
members
of
a
multi-state
ring
which
specializes
in
extorting
money
from
victims
upon
threat
to
accuse
them
of
homosexual
activities.
the
indictments
in
the
present
case
were
returned
under
a
federal
interstate
racketeering
statute.
the
so-called
travel
act
section
1952
of
the
federal
criminal
code
which
makes
it
a
federal
offense
to
travel
in
interstate
commerce
with
the
intent
to
carry
on
an
unlawful
activity
including
extortion
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
state
in
which
committed
and
thereafter
to
perform
an
act
promoting
that
objective.
the
indictments
in
the
present
case
were
on
appellee's
motion
dismissed
by
the
district
court.
the
court
found
first
that
in
using
the
term
extortion,
congress
intended
that
the
term
should
track
closely
the
legal
understanding
of
that
term
under
state
law.
but
that
in
pennsylvania,
the
crime
captioned
extortion
is
the
common
law
form
of
extortion,
that
is
the
crime
committed
by
a
public
officer
who
takes
an
unauthorized
or
excessive
fee.
in
that
sense,
the
appellees
had
not
been
alleged
to
be
public
officers
and
in
fact
were
conceded
not
to
be.
the
indictment
failed
the
state
in
offense
against
them.
it's
the
government's
contention
that
this
statute
uses
the
term
extortion
and
the
other
terms
that
are
listed
in
the
statute
generically,
so
that
conduct
has
referred
to
a
sort
of
criminal
activity,
extortion
at
acts
and
that
interstate
travel
to
promote
this
type
of
act
is
reached
by
the
federal
statute
so
long
as
the
conduct
is
made
unlawful
by
the
law
of
the
state
whatever
the
particular
label
the
state
happens
to
attach
to
it.
the
issue
before
the
court
this
morning
is
whether
the
government's
construction
rather
then
the
district
court
is
the
correct
one.
the
travel
act
which
was
enacted
in
1961
is
part
of
a
series
of
measures
to
combat
organized
crime
and
racketeering
makes
it
a
general
offense
provides
generally
that
interstate
travel
to
promote
an
unlawful
activity
as
subsequently
defined
is
a
federal
violation.
interstate
--
unlawful
activity
could
be
in
violation
of
the
law
of
the
state
or
of
the
united
states
and
for
relevant
purposes
the
statute
makes
it
a
federal
violation
to
travel
in
interstate
commerce
to
carry
on
extortion
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
several
--
of
a
particular
state.
the
allegations
in
the
present
indictments
alleged
that
at
least
one
of
the
conspirators
traveled
in
interstate
commerce
from
chicago
to
philadelphia
in
two
cases
and
from
camden,
new
jersey
to
philadelphia,
and
the
third
with
the
intent
to
promote
an
activity
unlawful
under
pennsylvania
law.
the
controversy
in
this
case
arises
from
the
fact
that
under
pennsylvania
law,
extortion
at
conduct
is
termed
blackmail
rather
than
extortion
but
pennsylvania
does
have
as
i
mentioned
the
continuation
of
the
original
ancient
common
law
and
notion
of
extortion,
the
acceptance
by
public
officer
of
unlawful
fees.
the
district
court
on
its
analysis
of
the
language
of
the
statute
and
its
legislative
history
concluded
that
congress
intended
when
it
spoke
of
extortion
and
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
state
in
which
committed
that
the
federal
term
should
track
closely
the
legal
understanding
of
that
term
in
state
law.
we
contend
that
this
construction
of
the
statute,
this
serves
the
remedial
objectives
of
this
federal
legislation
and
in
supportively
narrows
its
plain
meaning.
i
should
like
to
turn
first
to
the
background
and
purpose
of
the
statute.
i
mentioned
that
this
was
one
of
a
series
of
measures
submitted
by
the
department
of
justice
in
1961
to
bring
federal
resources
and
the
federal
criminal
process
to
bear
on
a
problem
which
had
outgrown
the
capacity
of
state
and
local
governments
to
deal
with.
and
that
is
the
situation
which
we've
encountered
through
the
ability
of
the
modern
organized
syndicate
criminal
to
conduct
illegal
operations
from
a
remote
state
sending
minions
back
and
forth
across
state
lines
to
carry
out
various
forms
of
illicit
activity
using
the
long
distance
telephone
to
manage
or
carry
out
various
forms
of
violations
of
state
laws.
this
mobility
and
this
diffusion
of
organization
made
it
extremely
difficult
for
state
and
local
authorities
to
investigate
or
to
prosecute
violations
of
their
local
laws.
now,
the
statute
as
it's
clear
both
from
its
language
and
its
legislative
history
does
not
pruport
to
close
off
the
channels
of
interstate
commerce
to
all
attempts
to
violate
state
law
because
its
focus
was
organized
crime
and
racketeering,
the
organs
of
communication
from
one
state
to
another
were
to
be
interrupted
for
those
who
would
travel
in
commerce
to
carry
out
unlawful
activities
only
with
respect
to
activities
which
years
of
investigation
by
state
and
local
crime
commissions
by
the
federal
government
and
by
congressional
committees
had
shown
to
be
the
mainstays
of
organized
crime.
and
for
that
reason,
the
term
“unlawful
activity”
in
the
travel
act
is
defined
to
include
only
business
enterprises
involving
gambling,
prostitution,
liquor
and
narcotics
violation
and
extortion,
bribery
and
arson
in
violation
of
state
or
federal
law.
these
were
the
activities
that
these
investigations
had
established
to
be
one
of
the
principal
occupations
of
the
organized
modern
nationwide
criminal
operations.
the
question
before
the
court
is
what
congress
intended
to
reach
by
using
the
term
“extortion
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
state
in
which
committed.”
the
district
court
has
held
that
in
pennsylvania
and
therefore
as
it
recognized
in
at
least
12
other
states
which
also
do
not
condemn
extortionate
activities
under
the
heading
extortion
but
instead
maintained
some
continuation
of
the
common
law
notion
of
extortion
that
this
federal
statute
reaches
only
travel
in
interstate
commerce
into
a
state
by
a
public
official
of
that
state
to
accept
an
unauthorized
fee.
now,
it
is
our
contention
that
this
narrow
construction
by
the
district
court
is
plainly
an
error.
abusive
office
was
not
one
of
the
principal
forms
of
violations
that
motivated
congress
to
pass
this
federal
legislation
dealing
with
interstate
travel
to
promote
extortion.
there
are
several
reasons
that
make
that
clear.
first,
it's
unlikely
that
a
public
official
of
a
state
is
going
to
be
a
member
of
an
organized
criminal
syndicate
but
in
any
event,
his
opportunity
in
the
district
court's
analysis
to
commit
extortion
in
the
common
law
ancient
sense
derives
from
his
position
as
a
public
officer
within
the
state.
and
therefore,
he
is
not
the
type
of
individual
who
is
unlikely
to
be
amenable
to
investigation
and
prosecution
by
the
local
authorities.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
the
senate
or
house
hearings
do
not
reveal
any
specific
focus
on
the
question
of
what
extortion
was
meant.
however,
i
think
it
is
significant
that
in
the
course
of
wending
its
way
through
congress,
this
bill
was
sought
to
be
amended
by
the
house
in
a
way
in
which
i
think
will
illustrate
the
actual
intent
and
focus
that
congress
had
in
using
the
term
extortion.
as
i
mentioned,
the
unlawful
activities
are
defined
to
mean
four
illegal
business
operations
as
well
extortion,
bribery,
and
arson.
the
house
committee
subsequently
ratified
by
the
full
house
tried
to
limit
extortion
and
bribery
to
offenses
committed
in
connection
with
the
illegal
businesses
otherwise
defined
in
the
statute.
the
department
of
justice
vigorously
objected,
the
department
of
justice
had
sponsored
this
measure.
the
department
vigorously
objected
to
that
amendment
and
wrote
to
chairman
celler
of
the
house
committee
that
this
amendment
would
eliminate
from
the
purview
of
the
statute
extortions
which
were
unrelated
to
the
other
business
enterprises
mentioned
in
the
statute
but
which
were
and
had
historically
been
major
forms
of
extortion
perpetuated
by
organized
crime
and
this
letter
from
the
justice
department
explicitly
mentioned
that
such
forms
of
extortion
practice
by
organized
crime
include
shakedown
rackets,
shylocking
or
the
charging
of
usurious
interests
on
loans,
and
labor
extortion.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
letter
is
not
in
the
brief.
it's
quoted
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
in
the
record?
no,
there
was
--
this
case
arises
on
dismissal
of
an
indictment.
there's
no
record.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
--
it
is
quoted
in
a
law
review
article
which
we
cite
the
palner
article
in
volume
28
of
the
brooklyn
law
review.
it
apparently
was
not
published
as
part
of
the
hearings
or
the
committee
reports
because
it
was
submitted
after
the
reports
had
been
printed
by
the
various
committees.
all
that
we
have
is
the
conference
report
which
merely
states
the
conclusion
that
the
senate
had
agreed
to
the
house
insistence.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
article
was
written
by
an
attorney
of
the
department
of
justice.
i
realize
that
may
seem
self-serving.
we
have
no
reason
to
doubt
his
good
faith
but
that
is
the
only
place
that
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
apparently,
i
think
that's
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
we
--
i'm
sure
we
can
obtain
the
copy
of
that
letter
and
submit
it
if
the
court
wishes
to
see
it,
if
the
court
wishes
to
see
the
full
letter.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
very
fine,
i'll
make
final
arrangements
to
do
that.
but
it
was
in
that
context
that
the
conference
committees
deleted
the
limiting
language
and
restored
the
bill
to
its
fuller
scope,
we
don't
rely
solely
on
that
one
isolated
and
perhaps
not
terribly
accessible
piece
of
legislative
history.
our
basic
argument
as
we
went
to
in
great
length
in
the
brief
is
that
the
background
of
the
legislation
shows
that
we're
dealing
with
the
types
of
activity
engaged
in
by
organized
crime
syndicates
and
public
officer
exactions
are
not
a
principal
form
of
this
activity.
the
other
terms
used
in
the
statute
also
are
clearly
used
in
their
generic
sense.
the
term
gambling
or
narcotics
violations
clearly
doesn't
and
as
the
hearings
themselves
will
show,
it
does
not
point
only
to
a
section
of
a
state
law
which
is
captioned
gambling
or
narcotic
violations.
this
is
an
effort
by
congress
to
refer
us
to
categories
of
crime
which
if
made
unlawful
by
the
state
where
the
activity
is
going
to
be
conducted.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes.
that
i
think
underscores
the
soundness
of
our
position
because
under
the
district
court's
approach,
the
use
of
those
two
terms
side
by
side
in
the
statute
would
make
one
of
them
superfluous
in
at
least
a
third
to
a
quarter
of
the
states.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
arson
was
added
in
1965.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
right.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
except
for
the
citation
in
the
--
of
the
law
review
article,
there
is
none.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
resume
by
returning
to
the
point
that
mr.
justice
stewart
raised
in
his
question
noting
the
relative
sparseness
of
the
legislative
history
on
the
question
of
what
congress
understood
by
the
term
extortion.
i
began
to
respond
to
the
question
by
suggesting
that
since
congress
dealt
in
a
clause
in
which
it
uses
the
term
extortion,
with
another
offense
which
it
termed
bribery
that
the
district
court's
analysis
would
in
pennsylvania
and
about
at
least
seven
and
perhaps
many
more
states
made
one
of
the
other
of
these
two
terms
redundant
because
in
pennsylvania,
the
crime
caption
extortion
is
simply
a
form
of
bribery.
that
i
think
is
not
the
limit
of
the
fair
inferences
that
can
be
drawn
from
the
legislative
history.
i
mentioned
earlier
that
this
legislation
was
considered
along
with
the
package
of
other
measures
that
have
been
submitted
in
1961
to
deal
with
the
subject
of
organized
crime.
two
other
statutes
which
were
submitted
and
being
considered
by
congress
of
the
very
same
time,
the
hearings
in
both
the
house
and
the
senate
were
held
on
a
series
of
measures
and
two
of
the
bills
that
were
before
congress
at
the
time,
used
the
term
extortion
in
the
sense
that
we
suggest
that
congress
understood
in
passage
of
the
travel
act.
the
first
was
a
measure
to
amend
and
expand
the
fugitive
felon
act
which
at
the
time
was
limited
only
to
those
who
had
fled
from
states
to
avoid
prosecution
for
certain
defined
felonies,
certain
enumerated
felonies,
one
of
which
was
extortion
under
--
by
threat
of
violence.
another
one
of
the
measures
that
congress
was
considering
at
the
very
time
that
it
had
travel
act's
terms
before
it
was
a
proposal
to
provide
for
a
grant
of
immunity
in
situations
where
there
was
an
arguable
violation
of
either
the
labor
management
relations
act
or
the
hobbs
act
which
punished
opposite
sides
of
the
same
coin.
the
hobbs
act
punishes
extortion
presumably
covering
labor
extortion
and
the
1960
--1947
labor
act
makes
it
an
offense
for
an
employer
to
give
money
or
thing
of
value
to
a
union
official
apart
from
his
wages.
so
that
there
was
before
congress
at
the
time
it
was
considering
the
travel
act
two
pieces
of
legislation
which
used
the
term
extortion
in
the
precised
generic
sense
of
a
coercive
exaction
under
threat
or
force
or
accusation
that
had
been
used
to
underlie
the
earlier
measures.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that
is
correct
sir.
that's
the
source
of
the
difficulty.
we
have
suggested
on
a
related
alternative
argument
that
blackmail
has
for
a
hundred
years
or
more
have
been
considered
a
synonym
for
extortion
and
indeed
the
pennsylvania
courts
and
the
pennsylvania
legislature
used
these
terms
interchangeably
and
in
cases
which
the
district
court
saw
fit
to
reject
as
ill
considered,
the
pennsylvania
state
courts
have
in
fact
sustained
indictments
drawn
under
the
blackmail
statute's
alleged
in
the
instant
indictments
even
though
those
indictments
in
the
state
courts
charged
extortion
by
accusation
of
heinous
crime
rather
than
blackmail
as
the
statute
has
captioned.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes.
in
our
appendix
to
our
brief,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
set
forth
that
there
are
at
least
13
states
which
punish
this
form
of
conduct
under
a
blackmail
statute
and
at
least
seven
of
those
states,
extortion
is
a
separately
defined
offense
but
it
relates
to
the
common
law
form
of
extortion.
now,
in
it,
we
also
set
forth
that
there
are
other
classifications
of
extortion
at
conduct
in
other
states,
robbery,
threats,
and
menaces.
in
a
number
of
those
other
states,
similarly,
there
is
a
crime
expressly
called
extortion
that
does
relate
either
to
the
public
officer
exaction
or
to
some
other
anachronistic,
we
might
say,
notions
of
extortion
in
five
or
six
states,
the
only
offense
called
extortion
is
the
charging
by
a
railroad
company
of
an
unfair
tariff
and
presumably
under
the
district
court's
mechanical
analysis,
the
only
offenses
that
would
be
reached
by
the
travel
act
in
those
states
would
be
the
submission
by
mail
of
a
bill
by
a
railroad
company
of
an
inflated
charge.
that
is
not
in
any
way
related
to
the
organized
crime
focus
of
this
measure.
we
did
not
collect
in
our
appendix
all
of
the
possible
permutations
of
relating
the
categorization
of
the
statutes.
you'll
--
you
will
notice
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
last
category
on
page
30
and
31
of
our
brief
lists
statutes
which
make
some
mention
in
their
caption
of
extortion.
they
--
some
of
them
are
however
hybrids
like
fear
used
to
extort
or
larceny
by
extortion.
in
some
of
those
states,
there
is
a
crime
caption
simply
extortion
which
is
the
public
officer
exaction.
how
the
district
court
would
deal
with
these
we
can't
imagine
but
this
confirms
we
believe
that
we
should
be
looking
not
to
labels
but
to
substance
in
interpreting
the
statute.
the
focus
of
the
congressional
concern
in
this
area
was
with
the
type
of
activity
which
years
of
investigation
had
shown
organized
crime
syndicates
customarily
resorted
to
in
maulting
their
profits.
they
had
not
be
shown
and
no
one
has
yet
suggested
not
even
the
district
court
that
acceptance
of
unlawful
fees
is
a
traditional
form
of
organized
crime.
we
consider
rather
that
congress
used
the
term
extortion
as
it
used
the
other
terms
in
the
statute
in
its
generic
sense
as
relating
to
a
category
of
possibly
unlawful
conduct
i.e.
an
attempt
to
obtain
money
or
property
from
an
individual
by
a
threat
either
to
commit
injury
upon
him
or
his
family
or
his
property
or
to
obtain
some
advantage
or
to
accuse
him
of
a
heinous
crime
or
some
other
indictable
offense.
the
district
court
supported
its
analysis
by
pointing
to
the
language
of
the
statute
and
to
the
undisputed
congressional
policy
of
respecting
the
variations
in
state
criminal
law
definitions.
neither
of
these
factors
however
supports
the
district
court's
analysis.
first,
the
language
of
the
statute
does
not
even
say
that
it
is
an
offense
to
travel
in
interstate
commerce
to
engage
in
activity
in
violation
of
extortion
laws
of
the
state.
we
might
have
a
somewhat
graver
problem
in
accepting
the
government's
construction
if
that
were
the
usage
but
we
have
instead
an
act
which
punishes
interstate
commerce
to
promote
extortion
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
state
in
which
committed.
we
suggest,
this
is
quite
susceptible
and
is
infact
of
the
construction
and
is
in
fact
the
intended
construction
of
meaning
that
congress
was
concerned
about
a
category
of
activity
and
so
long
as
that
activity,
that
type
of
activity
is
actually
made
unlawful
under
the
laws
of
the
state
in
which
the
activity
is
committed.
it
is
reached
by
this
federal
statute.
similarly,
the
congressional
awareness
that
the
contours
of
criminal
activity
will
vary
from
state
to
state
even
within
a
particular
type
of
activity,
in
no
way
suggests
that
the
label
that
the
particular
state
happens
to
affix
in
outlawing
some
forms
of
that
activity
should
rigidly
control
the
interpretation
of
this
federal
statute.
the
exchanges
in
the
legislative
history
relied
on
by
the
district
court
related
to
gambling,
it
was
expressly
recognized
that
for
several
reasons,
an
individual
who
operated
a
lawful
gambling
business
in
nevada
would
not
be
in
violation
of
this
statute
if
he
traveled
to
promote
that
activity.
now,
the
district
court
somehow
extrapolated
from
that
that
congress
intended
that
the
definition
of
the
terms
used
in
the
federal
statute
should
track
closely
their
legal
understanding
under
state
law.
the
cited
passage
in
no
way
supports
that
no
one
either
on
the
committee
or
any
of
the
witnesses
testifying
indicated
that
whether
or
not
the
gambler,
the
las
vegas
gambler's
travel
was
lawful
was
going
to
turn
on
whether
or
not
his
activities
were
dealt
with
under
the
statute
talking
of
gambling.
it
was
assumed
throughout
the
legislative
history
that
even
if
the
state
had
a
statute
outlawing
a
lottery
under
the
statute
gambling
and
outlawed
book
making
separately
under
a
statute
entitled
book
making.
a
bookmaker
who
travels
in
interstate
commerce
would
still
be
in
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
there
have
been
other
prosecutions
under
the
extortion
branch
of
this
statute
including
some
for
extortion
of
conduct
engaged
in,
in
states
which
punish
only
blackmail,
or
punish
a
crime
called
blackmail
and
which
have
instead
under
the
heading
extortion
the
public
officer
exaction
case
conduct.
there's
a
reported
decision
to
that
effect,
united
states
versus
hughes
in
385
f.2nd
where
the
extortion
was
conducted
in
north
carolina
which
is
one
of
the
states
listed
in
our
blackmail
list
and
which
also
has
an
extortion
statute
similar
to
that
in
pennsylvania.
there
was
no
challenge
in
that
statute
to
the
reach
of
the
extortion
term
of
this
legislation.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
this
act
was
passed
in
1961.
this
is
another
argument
that
we
believe
supports
our
construction
even
though
concededly
the
legislative
history
is
not
expressed
on
the
question
of
how
congress
defined
or
understood
the
term.
when
congress
legislates
on
a
criminal
subject
in
the
1960s,
we
think
it
highly
desirable
that
it
be
taken
to
be
using
terms
in
their
common
place
everyday
sense
because
it
is
this
sense
which
the
average
man
of
ordinary
intelligence
who
must
gauge
his
conduct
by
the
measure
should
be
held
to
understand
it.
and
as
we've
seen
recent
pieces
of
federal
legislations
as
well
as
the
pennsylvania
judicial
and
legislative
treatment
and
the
scholarly
opinions
cited
in
our
brief
all
illustrate
that
today
the
1960s
extortion
does
not
mean
an
exaction
by
a
public
official,
the
mere
acceptance
of
an
unauthorized
fee
even
on
the
absence
of
any
coercion.
it
means
rather
an
attempt
to
obtain
something
of
value
from
the
individual
by
making
a
threat
to
do
some
injury
to
him
or
to
his
reputation.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no
not
necessarily.
if
we
look
to
pennsylvania
law
to
see
what
a
man
of
ordinary
intelligence
in
pennsylvania
would
have
had
understood
this
conduct
to
proscribe,
we
submit,
he
would
have
been
on
fair
notice
that
the
federal
statute
was
prohibiting
his
conduct
even
though
the
conduct
is
termed
blackmail
on
pennsylvania.
i've
already
referred
to
the
judicial
decisions
in
pennsylvania
which
it
sustained
extortion
indictments
under
blackmail
statutes.
the
blackmail
statutes
themselves
used
the
term
whoever
with
intent
to
extort
makes
certain
types
of
threats.
if
the
individual
consulted
the
general
index
to
the
pennsylvania
statues
to
see
what
extortion
and
violation
of
state
laws
meant,
one
of
the
earliest
listing
under
the
general
heading
extortion
is
a
reference
is
a
to
the
blackmail
statutes.
there
is
a
cross-reference
under
the
extortion
statute
in
pennsylvania
which
says
for
extortions
by
others
than
public
officers
see
the
sections
involved
in
this
case.
so
i
think
not
only
do
we
have
the
ordinary
understanding
of
the
average
citizen
in
pennsylvania
and
elsewhere
in
the
english
speaking
world
that
extortion
means
a
coercive
attempt
to
obtain
property
under
threat
but
we
have
expressed
authority
that
pennsylvania
regards
this
form
of
conduct
as
extortion
and
we
see
no
notice
or
vagueness
problems
in
the
statute.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
in
--
we
accept
the
general
validity
of
that
proposition.
we
don't
think
it
cuts
against
us
here.
we
want
this
statute
strictly
construed
in
accordance
with
the
fair
meaning
of
its
terms.
we're
not
trying
to
expand
the
notion
of
extortion
beyond
what
it
commonly
means.
we're
not
trying
to
reach
into
the
remote
extensions
of
what
may
be
extortionate.
it's
also
perhaps
notable
to
point
out
that
as
the
district
court
recognized,
this
conduct
is
malum
in
se.
it
is
clearly
a
violation
of
pennsylvania
law
so
we
don't
have
the
situation
where
the
individual
is
completely
blameless
or
not
depending
on
the
meaning
of
this
federal
statute.
his
guilt
under
the
federal
statute
may
turn
on
what
extortion
means
but
we're
not
trying
to
use
a
god
out
of
the
air
to
impose
criminal
liability
on
otherwise
innocent
conduct.
so
we
think
that
there's
no
offense
here
against
the
general
maxim
about
construing
criminal
statute.
i
would
like
to
save
any
remaining
time
for
rebuttal
if
the
court
has
no
questions.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
thank
you.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
mr.
justice
white,
i'm
not
sure
what
the
result
of
the
colloquy
was
between
counsel
and
you
on
the
question
of
possible
effect
of
re-labeling
or
separating
out
provisions
that
at
one
time
were
called
extortion.
but
on
page
22
of
our
brief
i'd
like
to
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
up
until
1939,
the
homosexual
extortion
conduct
presently
termed
blackmail
was
in
fact
called
extortion
by
threats
to
accuse
of
an
infamous
crime.
mr.
chief
justice,
you
also
mentioned
an
anomaly
that
would
be
caused
by
accepting
the
appellee's
position
that
is
the
statute
would
not
apply
to
conduct
unlawful
in
pennsylvania
but
would
apply
to
conduct
unlawful
in
california
simply
because
the
difference
in
the
labels
atop
the
statutes.
we
needn't
speculate
about
that.
there's
currently
before
the
court
on
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
raising
other
issues,
pyne
versus
united
states,
number
507
which
does
involve
identical
type
of
homosexual
extortion
statute
--
identical
type
of
homosexual
extortion
scheme
involved
here.
but
there,
the
gang
members
went
from
chicago
west
to
utah
which
calls
the
conduct
extortion
rather
than
east
to
pennsylvania.
but
we
submit
that
there's
no
reason
for
thinking
congress
didn't
wish
to
reach
both
types
of
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
which
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
grows
out
of
the
efforts
to
uncover
and
prosecute
the
members
of
a
multi-state
ring
which
specializes
in
extorting
money
from
victims
upon
threat
to
accuse
them
of
homosexual
activities.
the
indictments
in
the
present
case
were
returned
under
a
federal
interstate
racketeering
statute.
the
so-called
travel
act
section
1952
of
the
federal
criminal
code
which
makes
it
a
federal
offense
to
travel
in
interstate
commerce
with
the
intent
to
carry
on
an
unlawful
activity
including
extortion
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
state
in
which
committed
and
thereafter
to
perform
an
act
promoting
that
objective.
the
indictments
in
the
present
case
were
on
appellee's
motion
dismissed
by
the
district
court.
the
court
found
first
that
in
using
the
term
extortion,
congress
intended
that
the
term
should
track
closely
the
legal
understanding
of
that
term
under
state
law.
but
that
in
pennsylvania,
the
crime
captioned
extortion
is
the
common
law
form
of
extortion,
that
is
the
crime
committed
by
a
public
officer
who
takes
an
unauthorized
or
excessive
fee.
in
that
sense,
the
appellees
had
not
been
alleged
to
be
public
officers
and
in
fact
were
conceded
not
to
be.
the
indictment
failed
the
state
in
offense
against
them.
it's
the
government's
contention
that
this
statute
uses
the
term
extortion
and
the
other
terms
that
are
listed
in
the
statute
generically,
so
that
conduct
has
referred
to
a
sort
of
criminal
activity,
extortion
at
acts
and
that
interstate
travel
to
promote
this
type
of
act
is
reached
by
the
federal
statute
so
long
as
the
conduct
is
made
unlawful
by
the
law
of
the
state
whatever
the
particular
label
the
state
happens
to
attach
to
it.
the
issue
before
the
court
this
morning
is
whether
the
government's
construction
rather
then
the
district
court
is
the
correct
one.
the
travel
act
which
was
enacted
in
1961
is
part
of
a
series
of
measures
to
combat
organized
crime
and
racketeering
makes
it
a
general
offense
provides
generally
that
interstate
travel
to
promote
an
unlawful
activity
as
subsequently
defined
is
a
federal
violation.
interstate
--
unlawful
activity
could
be
in
violation
of
the
law
of
the
state
or
of
the
united
states
and
for
relevant
purposes
the
statute
makes
it
a
federal
violation
to
travel
in
interstate
commerce
to
carry
on
extortion
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
several
--
of
a
particular
state.
the
allegations
in
the
present
indictments
alleged
that
at
least
one
of
the
conspirators
traveled
in
interstate
commerce
from
chicago
to
philadelphia
in
two
cases
and
from
camden,
new
jersey
to
philadelphia,
and
the
third
with
the
intent
to
promote
an
activity
unlawful
under
pennsylvania
law.
the
controversy
in
this
case
arises
from
the
fact
that
under
pennsylvania
law,
extortion
at
conduct
is
termed
blackmail
rather
than
extortion
but
pennsylvania
does
have
as
i
mentioned
the
continuation
of
the
original
ancient
common
law
and
notion
of
extortion,
the
acceptance
by
public
officer
of
unlawful
fees.
the
district
court
on
its
analysis
of
the
language
of
the
statute
and
its
legislative
history
concluded
that
congress
intended
when
it
spoke
of
extortion
and
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
state
in
which
committed
that
the
federal
term
should
track
closely
the
legal
understanding
of
that
term
in
state
law.
we
contend
that
this
construction
of
the
statute,
this
serves
the
remedial
objectives
of
this
federal
legislation
and
in
supportively
narrows
its
plain
meaning.
i
should
like
to
turn
first
to
the
background
and
purpose
of
the
statute.
i
mentioned
that
this
was
one
of
a
series
of
measures
submitted
by
the
department
of
justice
in
1961
to
bring
federal
resources
and
the
federal
criminal
process
to
bear
on
a
problem
which
had
outgrown
the
capacity
of
state
and
local
governments
to
deal
with.
and
that
is
the
situation
which
we've
encountered
through
the
ability
of
the
modern
organized
syndicate
criminal
to
conduct
illegal
operations
from
a
remote
state
sending
minions
back
and
forth
across
state
lines
to
carry
out
various
forms
of
illicit
activity
using
the
long
distance
telephone
to
manage
or
carry
out
various
forms
of
violations
of
state
laws.
this
mobility
and
this
diffusion
of
organization
made
it
extremely
difficult
for
state
and
local
authorities
to
investigate
or
to
prosecute
violations
of
their
local
laws.
now,
the
statute
as
it's
clear
both
from
its
language
and
its
legislative
history
does
not
pruport
to
close
off
the
channels
of
interstate
commerce
to
all
attempts
to
violate
state
law
because
its
focus
was
organized
crime
and
racketeering,
the
organs
of
communication
from
one
state
to
another
were
to
be
interrupted
for
those
who
would
travel
in
commerce
to
carry
out
unlawful
activities
only
with
respect
to
activities
which
years
of
investigation
by
state
and
local
crime
commissions
by
the
federal
government
and
by
congressional
committees
had
shown
to
be
the
mainstays
of
organized
crime.
and
for
that
reason,
the
term
“unlawful
activity”
in
the
travel
act
is
defined
to
include
only
business
enterprises
involving
gambling,
prostitution,
liquor
and
narcotics
violation
and
extortion,
bribery
and
arson
in
violation
of
state
or
federal
law.
these
were
the
activities
that
these
investigations
had
established
to
be
one
of
the
principal
occupations
of
the
organized
modern
nationwide
criminal
operations.
the
question
before
the
court
is
what
congress
intended
to
reach
by
using
the
term
“extortion
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
state
in
which
committed.”
the
district
court
has
held
that
in
pennsylvania
and
therefore
as
it
recognized
in
at
least
12
other
states
which
also
do
not
condemn
extortionate
activities
under
the
heading
extortion
but
instead
maintained
some
continuation
of
the
common
law
notion
of
extortion
that
this
federal
statute
reaches
only
travel
in
interstate
commerce
into
a
state
by
a
public
official
of
that
state
to
accept
an
unauthorized
fee.
now,
it
is
our
contention
that
this
narrow
construction
by
the
district
court
is
plainly
an
error.
abusive
office
was
not
one
of
the
principal
forms
of
violations
that
motivated
congress
to
pass
this
federal
legislation
dealing
with
interstate
travel
to
promote
extortion.
there
are
several
reasons
that
make
that
clear.
first,
it's
unlikely
that
a
public
official
of
a
state
is
going
to
be
a
member
of
an
organized
criminal
syndicate
but
in
any
event,
his
opportunity
in
the
district
court's
analysis
to
commit
extortion
in
the
common
law
ancient
sense
derives
from
his
position
as
a
public
officer
within
the
state.
and
therefore,
he
is
not
the
type
of
individual
who
is
unlikely
to
be
amenable
to
investigation
and
prosecution
by
the
local
authorities.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
the
senate
or
house
hearings
do
not
reveal
any
specific
focus
on
the
question
of
what
extortion
was
meant.
however,
i
think
it
is
significant
that
in
the
course
of
wending
its
way
through
congress,
this
bill
was
sought
to
be
amended
by
the
house
in
a
way
in
which
i
think
will
illustrate
the
actual
intent
and
focus
that
congress
had
in
using
the
term
extortion.
as
i
mentioned,
the
unlawful
activities
are
defined
to
mean
four
illegal
business
operations
as
well
extortion,
bribery,
and
arson.
the
house
committee
subsequently
ratified
by
the
full
house
tried
to
limit
extortion
and
bribery
to
offenses
committed
in
connection
with
the
illegal
businesses
otherwise
defined
in
the
statute.
the
department
of
justice
vigorously
objected,
the
department
of
justice
had
sponsored
this
measure.
the
department
vigorously
objected
to
that
amendment
and
wrote
to
chairman
celler
of
the
house
committee
that
this
amendment
would
eliminate
from
the
purview
of
the
statute
extortions
which
were
unrelated
to
the
other
business
enterprises
mentioned
in
the
statute
but
which
were
and
had
historically
been
major
forms
of
extortion
perpetuated
by
organized
crime
and
this
letter
from
the
justice
department
explicitly
mentioned
that
such
forms
of
extortion
practice
by
organized
crime
include
shakedown
rackets,
shylocking
or
the
charging
of
usurious
interests
on
loans,
and
labor
extortion.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
letter
is
not
in
the
brief.
it's
quoted
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
in
the
record?
no,
there
was
--
this
case
arises
on
dismissal
of
an
indictment.
there's
no
record.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
--
it
is
quoted
in
a
law
review
article
which
we
cite
the
palner
article
in
volume
28
of
the
brooklyn
law
review.
it
apparently
was
not
published
as
part
of
the
hearings
or
the
committee
reports
because
it
was
submitted
after
the
reports
had
been
printed
by
the
various
committees.
all
that
we
have
is
the
conference
report
which
merely
states
the
conclusion
that
the
senate
had
agreed
to
the
house
insistence.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
article
was
written
by
an
attorney
of
the
department
of
justice.
i
realize
that
may
seem
self-serving.
we
have
no
reason
to
doubt
his
good
faith
but
that
is
the
only
place
that
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
apparently,
i
think
that's
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
we
--
i'm
sure
we
can
obtain
the
copy
of
that
letter
and
submit
it
if
the
court
wishes
to
see
it,
if
the
court
wishes
to
see
the
full
letter.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
very
fine,
i'll
make
final
arrangements
to
do
that.
but
it
was
in
that
context
that
the
conference
committees
deleted
the
limiting
language
and
restored
the
bill
to
its
fuller
scope,
we
don't
rely
solely
on
that
one
isolated
and
perhaps
not
terribly
accessible
piece
of
legislative
history.
our
basic
argument
as
we
went
to
in
great
length
in
the
brief
is
that
the
background
of
the
legislation
shows
that
we're
dealing
with
the
types
of
activity
engaged
in
by
organized
crime
syndicates
and
public
officer
exactions
are
not
a
principal
form
of
this
activity.
the
other
terms
used
in
the
statute
also
are
clearly
used
in
their
generic
sense.
the
term
gambling
or
narcotics
violations
clearly
doesn't
and
as
the
hearings
themselves
will
show,
it
does
not
point
only
to
a
section
of
a
state
law
which
is
captioned
gambling
or
narcotic
violations.
this
is
an
effort
by
congress
to
refer
us
to
categories
of
crime
which
if
made
unlawful
by
the
state
where
the
activity
is
going
to
be
conducted.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes.
that
i
think
underscores
the
soundness
of
our
position
because
under
the
district
court's
approach,
the
use
of
those
two
terms
side
by
side
in
the
statute
would
make
one
of
them
superfluous
in
at
least
a
third
to
a
quarter
of
the
states.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
arson
was
added
in
1965.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
right.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
except
for
the
citation
in
the
--
of
the
law
review
article,
there
is
none.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
resume
by
returning
to
the
point
that
mr.
justice
stewart
raised
in
his
question
noting
the
relative
sparseness
of
the
legislative
history
on
the
question
of
what
congress
understood
by
the
term
extortion.
i
began
to
respond
to
the
question
by
suggesting
that
since
congress
dealt
in
a
clause
in
which
it
uses
the
term
extortion,
with
another
offense
which
it
termed
bribery
that
the
district
court's
analysis
would
in
pennsylvania
and
about
at
least
seven
and
perhaps
many
more
states
made
one
of
the
other
of
these
two
terms
redundant
because
in
pennsylvania,
the
crime
caption
extortion
is
simply
a
form
of
bribery.
that
i
think
is
not
the
limit
of
the
fair
inferences
that
can
be
drawn
from
the
legislative
history.
i
mentioned
earlier
that
this
legislation
was
considered
along
with
the
package
of
other
measures
that
have
been
submitted
in
1961
to
deal
with
the
subject
of
organized
crime.
two
other
statutes
which
were
submitted
and
being
considered
by
congress
of
the
very
same
time,
the
hearings
in
both
the
house
and
the
senate
were
held
on
a
series
of
measures
and
two
of
the
bills
that
were
before
congress
at
the
time,
used
the
term
extortion
in
the
sense
that
we
suggest
that
congress
understood
in
passage
of
the
travel
act.
the
first
was
a
measure
to
amend
and
expand
the
fugitive
felon
act
which
at
the
time
was
limited
only
to
those
who
had
fled
from
states
to
avoid
prosecution
for
certain
defined
felonies,
certain
enumerated
felonies,
one
of
which
was
extortion
under
--
by
threat
of
violence.
another
one
of
the
measures
that
congress
was
considering
at
the
very
time
that
it
had
travel
act's
terms
before
it
was
a
proposal
to
provide
for
a
grant
of
immunity
in
situations
where
there
was
an
arguable
violation
of
either
the
labor
management
relations
act
or
the
hobbs
act
which
punished
opposite
sides
of
the
same
coin.
the
hobbs
act
punishes
extortion
presumably
covering
labor
extortion
and
the
1960
--1947
labor
act
makes
it
an
offense
for
an
employer
to
give
money
or
thing
of
value
to
a
union
official
apart
from
his
wages.
so
that
there
was
before
congress
at
the
time
it
was
considering
the
travel
act
two
pieces
of
legislation
which
used
the
term
extortion
in
the
precised
generic
sense
of
a
coercive
exaction
under
threat
or
force
or
accusation
that
had
been
used
to
underlie
the
earlier
measures.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that
is
correct
sir.
that's
the
source
of
the
difficulty.
we
have
suggested
on
a
related
alternative
argument
that
blackmail
has
for
a
hundred
years
or
more
have
been
considered
a
synonym
for
extortion
and
indeed
the
pennsylvania
courts
and
the
pennsylvania
legislature
used
these
terms
interchangeably
and
in
cases
which
the
district
court
saw
fit
to
reject
as
ill
considered,
the
pennsylvania
state
courts
have
in
fact
sustained
indictments
drawn
under
the
blackmail
statute's
alleged
in
the
instant
indictments
even
though
those
indictments
in
the
state
courts
charged
extortion
by
accusation
of
heinous
crime
rather
than
blackmail
as
the
statute
has
captioned.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes.
in
our
appendix
to
our
brief,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
set
forth
that
there
are
at
least
13
states
which
punish
this
form
of
conduct
under
a
blackmail
statute
and
at
least
seven
of
those
states,
extortion
is
a
separately
defined
offense
but
it
relates
to
the
common
law
form
of
extortion.
now,
in
it,
we
also
set
forth
that
there
are
other
classifications
of
extortion
at
conduct
in
other
states,
robbery,
threats,
and
menaces.
in
a
number
of
those
other
states,
similarly,
there
is
a
crime
expressly
called
extortion
that
does
relate
either
to
the
public
officer
exaction
or
to
some
other
anachronistic,
we
might
say,
notions
of
extortion
in
five
or
six
states,
the
only
offense
called
extortion
is
the
charging
by
a
railroad
company
of
an
unfair
tariff
and
presumably
under
the
district
court's
mechanical
analysis,
the
only
offenses
that
would
be
reached
by
the
travel
act
in
those
states
would
be
the
submission
by
mail
of
a
bill
by
a
railroad
company
of
an
inflated
charge.
that
is
not
in
any
way
related
to
the
organized
crime
focus
of
this
measure.
we
did
not
collect
in
our
appendix
all
of
the
possible
permutations
of
relating
the
categorization
of
the
statutes.
you'll
--
you
will
notice
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
last
category
on
page
30
and
31
of
our
brief
lists
statutes
which
make
some
mention
in
their
caption
of
extortion.
they
--
some
of
them
are
however
hybrids
like
fear
used
to
extort
or
larceny
by
extortion.
in
some
of
those
states,
there
is
a
crime
caption
simply
extortion
which
is
the
public
officer
exaction.
how
the
district
court
would
deal
with
these
we
can't
imagine
but
this
confirms
we
believe
that
we
should
be
looking
not
to
labels
but
to
substance
in
interpreting
the
statute.
the
focus
of
the
congressional
concern
in
this
area
was
with
the
type
of
activity
which
years
of
investigation
had
shown
organized
crime
syndicates
customarily
resorted
to
in
maulting
their
profits.
they
had
not
be
shown
and
no
one
has
yet
suggested
not
even
the
district
court
that
acceptance
of
unlawful
fees
is
a
traditional
form
of
organized
crime.
we
consider
rather
that
congress
used
the
term
extortion
as
it
used
the
other
terms
in
the
statute
in
its
generic
sense
as
relating
to
a
category
of
possibly
unlawful
conduct
i.e.
an
attempt
to
obtain
money
or
property
from
an
individual
by
a
threat
either
to
commit
injury
upon
him
or
his
family
or
his
property
or
to
obtain
some
advantage
or
to
accuse
him
of
a
heinous
crime
or
some
other
indictable
offense.
the
district
court
supported
its
analysis
by
pointing
to
the
language
of
the
statute
and
to
the
undisputed
congressional
policy
of
respecting
the
variations
in
state
criminal
law
definitions.
neither
of
these
factors
however
supports
the
district
court's
analysis.
first,
the
language
of
the
statute
does
not
even
say
that
it
is
an
offense
to
travel
in
interstate
commerce
to
engage
in
activity
in
violation
of
extortion
laws
of
the
state.
we
might
have
a
somewhat
graver
problem
in
accepting
the
government's
construction
if
that
were
the
usage
but
we
have
instead
an
act
which
punishes
interstate
commerce
to
promote
extortion
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
state
in
which
committed.
we
suggest,
this
is
quite
susceptible
and
is
infact
of
the
construction
and
is
in
fact
the
intended
construction
of
meaning
that
congress
was
concerned
about
a
category
of
activity
and
so
long
as
that
activity,
that
type
of
activity
is
actually
made
unlawful
under
the
laws
of
the
state
in
which
the
activity
is
committed.
it
is
reached
by
this
federal
statute.
similarly,
the
congressional
awareness
that
the
contours
of
criminal
activity
will
vary
from
state
to
state
even
within
a
particular
type
of
activity,
in
no
way
suggests
that
the
label
that
the
particular
state
happens
to
affix
in
outlawing
some
forms
of
that
activity
should
rigidly
control
the
interpretation
of
this
federal
statute.
the
exchanges
in
the
legislative
history
relied
on
by
the
district
court
related
to
gambling,
it
was
expressly
recognized
that
for
several
reasons,
an
individual
who
operated
a
lawful
gambling
business
in
nevada
would
not
be
in
violation
of
this
statute
if
he
traveled
to
promote
that
activity.
now,
the
district
court
somehow
extrapolated
from
that
that
congress
intended
that
the
definition
of
the
terms
used
in
the
federal
statute
should
track
closely
their
legal
understanding
under
state
law.
the
cited
passage
in
no
way
supports
that
no
one
either
on
the
committee
or
any
of
the
witnesses
testifying
indicated
that
whether
or
not
the
gambler,
the
las
vegas
gambler's
travel
was
lawful
was
going
to
turn
on
whether
or
not
his
activities
were
dealt
with
under
the
statute
talking
of
gambling.
it
was
assumed
throughout
the
legislative
history
that
even
if
the
state
had
a
statute
outlawing
a
lottery
under
the
statute
gambling
and
outlawed
book
making
separately
under
a
statute
entitled
book
making.
a
bookmaker
who
travels
in
interstate
commerce
would
still
be
in
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
there
have
been
other
prosecutions
under
the
extortion
branch
of
this
statute
including
some
for
extortion
of
conduct
engaged
in,
in
states
which
punish
only
blackmail,
or
punish
a
crime
called
blackmail
and
which
have
instead
under
the
heading
extortion
the
public
officer
exaction
case
conduct.
there's
a
reported
decision
to
that
effect,
united
states
versus
hughes
in
385
f.2nd
where
the
extortion
was
conducted
in
north
carolina
which
is
one
of
the
states
listed
in
our
blackmail
list
and
which
also
has
an
extortion
statute
similar
to
that
in
pennsylvania.
there
was
no
challenge
in
that
statute
to
the
reach
of
the
extortion
term
of
this
legislation.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
this
act
was
passed
in
1961.
this
is
another
argument
that
we
believe
supports
our
construction
even
though
concededly
the
legislative
history
is
not
expressed
on
the
question
of
how
congress
defined
or
understood
the
term.
when
congress
legislates
on
a
criminal
subject
in
the
1960s,
we
think
it
highly
desirable
that
it
be
taken
to
be
using
terms
in
their
common
place
everyday
sense
because
it
is
this
sense
which
the
average
man
of
ordinary
intelligence
who
must
gauge
his
conduct
by
the
measure
should
be
held
to
understand
it.
and
as
we've
seen
recent
pieces
of
federal
legislations
as
well
as
the
pennsylvania
judicial
and
legislative
treatment
and
the
scholarly
opinions
cited
in
our
brief
all
illustrate
that
today
the
1960s
extortion
does
not
mean
an
exaction
by
a
public
official,
the
mere
acceptance
of
an
unauthorized
fee
even
on
the
absence
of
any
coercion.
it
means
rather
an
attempt
to
obtain
something
of
value
from
the
individual
by
making
a
threat
to
do
some
injury
to
him
or
to
his
reputation.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no
not
necessarily.
if
we
look
to
pennsylvania
law
to
see
what
a
man
of
ordinary
intelligence
in
pennsylvania
would
have
had
understood
this
conduct
to
proscribe,
we
submit,
he
would
have
been
on
fair
notice
that
the
federal
statute
was
prohibiting
his
conduct
even
though
the
conduct
is
termed
blackmail
on
pennsylvania.
i've
already
referred
to
the
judicial
decisions
in
pennsylvania
which
it
sustained
extortion
indictments
under
blackmail
statutes.
the
blackmail
statutes
themselves
used
the
term
whoever
with
intent
to
extort
makes
certain
types
of
threats.
if
the
individual
consulted
the
general
index
to
the
pennsylvania
statues
to
see
what
extortion
and
violation
of
state
laws
meant,
one
of
the
earliest
listing
under
the
general
heading
extortion
is
a
reference
is
a
to
the
blackmail
statutes.
there
is
a
cross-reference
under
the
extortion
statute
in
pennsylvania
which
says
for
extortions
by
others
than
public
officers
see
the
sections
involved
in
this
case.
so
i
think
not
only
do
we
have
the
ordinary
understanding
of
the
average
citizen
in
pennsylvania
and
elsewhere
in
the
english
speaking
world
that
extortion
means
a
coercive
attempt
to
obtain
property
under
threat
but
we
have
expressed
authority
that
pennsylvania
regards
this
form
of
conduct
as
extortion
and
we
see
no
notice
or
vagueness
problems
in
the
statute.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
in
--
we
accept
the
general
validity
of
that
proposition.
we
don't
think
it
cuts
against
us
here.
we
want
this
statute
strictly
construed
in
accordance
with
the
fair
meaning
of
its
terms.
we're
not
trying
to
expand
the
notion
of
extortion
beyond
what
it
commonly
means.
we're
not
trying
to
reach
into
the
remote
extensions
of
what
may
be
extortionate.
it's
also
perhaps
notable
to
point
out
that
as
the
district
court
recognized,
this
conduct
is
malum
in
se.
it
is
clearly
a
violation
of
pennsylvania
law
so
we
don't
have
the
situation
where
the
individual
is
completely
blameless
or
not
depending
on
the
meaning
of
this
federal
statute.
his
guilt
under
the
federal
statute
may
turn
on
what
extortion
means
but
we're
not
trying
to
use
a
god
out
of
the
air
to
impose
criminal
liability
on
otherwise
innocent
conduct.
so
we
think
that
there's
no
offense
here
against
the
general
maxim
about
construing
criminal
statute.
i
would
like
to
save
any
remaining
time
for
rebuttal
if
the
court
has
no
questions.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
thank
you.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
mr.
justice
white,
i'm
not
sure
what
the
result
of
the
colloquy
was
between
counsel
and
you
on
the
question
of
possible
effect
of
re-labeling
or
separating
out
provisions
that
at
one
time
were
called
extortion.
but
on
page
22
of
our
brief
i'd
like
to
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
up
until
1939,
the
homosexual
extortion
conduct
presently
termed
blackmail
was
in
fact
called
extortion
by
threats
to
accuse
of
an
infamous
crime.
mr.
chief
justice,
you
also
mentioned
an
anomaly
that
would
be
caused
by
accepting
the
appellee's
position
that
is
the
statute
would
not
apply
to
conduct
unlawful
in
pennsylvania
but
would
apply
to
conduct
unlawful
in
california
simply
because
the
difference
in
the
labels
atop
the
statutes.
we
needn't
speculate
about
that.
there's
currently
before
the
court
on
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
raising
other
issues,
pyne
versus
united
states,
number
507
which
does
involve
identical
type
of
homosexual
extortion
statute
--
identical
type
of
homosexual
extortion
scheme
involved
here.
but
there,
the
gang
members
went
from
chicago
west
to
utah
which
calls
the
conduct
extortion
rather
than
east
to
pennsylvania.
but
we
submit
that
there's
no
reason
for
thinking
congress
didn't
wish
to
reach
both
types
of
--
