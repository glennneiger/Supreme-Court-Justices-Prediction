there's
no

but
where
did

get

from?
justice

can
you
get
it
again?
if
you
want
to
use
a
letter
like
that,
you
must
find
it
in
the
department's
files.
justice

well
i'd
be
happy
to
look
at
it,
if
you
want
us
to
look
at
any
of
it,
i
would
think
you
would
furnish
the
whole
record.
justice

in
any
event
which
is
the
brief
to
the
letter
you
and
i
were
discussing?
justice
byron

white
what
about
loan
sharking?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
sir.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
that
be
reached
by
this
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
would
admit
i
suppose
that
if
the
state
law
covered
loan
sharking
as
extortion,
in
a
statute
with
a
label
extortion
on
it,
could
it
then
construe
to
include
loan
sharking.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
have
any
problem.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
if
the
state
law
used
to
and
construe
extortion,
if
he
extorts
a
statute
to
cover
a,
b,
c,
d
and
e,
and
then
they
refined
their
statutes
and
they
took
out
of
the
extortion
--
out
from
under
extortion,
they
called
it
loan
sharking.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
wouldn't
you?
it
isn't
called
extortion.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
isn't
extortion
under
--
illegal
under
state
law
according
to
your
argument,
is
loan
sharking
illegal
under
state
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
we
got
an
opposite
track
with
just
a
hypothetical
case
but
i
suppose
your
argue
--
what
you're
making
with
the
--
you
would
certainly
stick
to
it
if
some
state
that
used
to
include
the
loan
sharking,
shylocking
or
something
under
extortion
suddenly
had
a
specific
statute
applied
to
shylocking
and
there's
no
longer
indictable
or
punishable
under
the
extortion
statute.
it
just
--
they
just
said,
we're
going
to
split
this
out
and
make
it
a
special
offense.
justice
byron

white
and
then
wouldn't
be
extortion
illegal
under
state
law,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only
reason
it
would
be
is
because
extortion
in
common
understanding
would
cover
situations
like
that
where
money
is
collected
under
a
threat
or
violence.

byron

precisely
the

argument
in
