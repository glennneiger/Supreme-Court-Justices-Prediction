criminal

must
be
strictly

do
you

any

who
leaves

go
into
another
and
commit
certain
offenses

engage
in
certain

what
you're
saying
is
when
they
could
do
the
other
and
they
say
violate
a
particular
thing
that
is
a
crime
in
the
state,
that
you
shouldn't
read
to
do
it
in
a
more
than

the

suppose
--
justice

may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
loan
shark
illustration?
suppose
that
a
law
would
be
passed
by
congress
stating
anyone
who
goes
from
pennsylvania
to
montana
for
the
purpose
of
lending
money
to
individuals
that
are
less
at
more
than
3%

what
would
you
say
about
that?
justice

well,
i
would
say
i'm
afraid
does
not
come
as
the
result
of
accumulated
experience
over
the
years.
but
my
frank,
of
course,
back
opinion
would
be
that
the
federal
government
could
in
one
fashion
or
another
justify
such
a
law.
justice
hugo
