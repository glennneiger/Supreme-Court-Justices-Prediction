mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
law
of
pennsylvania
in
its
definition
of
extortion
is
not
a
new
or
unusual
definition.
it
tracks
very
closely
if
i
may
borrow
a
term
from
the
district
court's
opinion,
the
common
law
definition
of
extortion
and
it
requires
without
getting
any
more
detailed
than
is
necessary
for
purposes
of
this
argument
that
at
least
one
of
the
parties
involved
in
an
exchange
of
money
to
do
something
must
be
an
individual
who
is
a
public
officer
and
a
public
officer
who
has
something
to
do
with
the
reason
why
the
money
is
passed.
this
statute
was
applied
in
pennsylvania
to
prosecute
when
they
are
discovered
officials
who
have
breached
their
duty,
their
sacred
trust
to
the
public
and
have
accepted
a
bribe.
it
is
not
as
it
has
been
characterized
by
the
government
in
its
brief,
in
its
oral
argument
merely
a
statute
that
involves
excessive
fees.
the
excessive
fee
mentioned
is
solely
to
exclude
the
defense
that
while
i
didn't
know
i
could
charge
$2.50
for
$1.50
gold
license.
this
is
the
statute
that
pennsylvania
uses
when
it
is
necessary
to
prosecute
corrupt
officials.
the
crime
of
bribery
in
pennsylvania
is
further
defined
by
the
legislature
and
is
set
down
in
the
penal
code
of
1939
and
that
involves
a
few
different
elements
when
a
bribe
must
be
given
or
accepted
by
certain
enumerated
officials
no
longer
just
an
undefined
quest
of
public
officials
and
it
has
to
do
with
specific
actions
that
they
are
supposed
to
take.
i
might
say
that
by
defining
extortion
i
know
and
by
defining
bribery
i
assume
and
by
all
of
its
definitions
of
common
law
crimes
pennsylvania
has
not
limited
violations
of
these
crimes
to
those
things
which
are
contained
in
the
statute.
there
are
cases
dealing
with
what
pennsylvania
calls
common
law
extortion
and
this
case
is
quite
frankly
are
generally
in
the
area
of
who
should
be
a
public
official.
the
common
law
definition
of
public
official
has
for
some
reason
by
the
courts
been
granted
a
wider
sphere
than
the
statutory
definition
but
in
no
instance,
in
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
is
activity
which
takes
place
between
two
individuals
who
are
not
public
officials,
who
were
not
named
in
the
statute
whereby
one
says
to
the
other,
“if
you
don't
give
me
a
certain
amount
of
money,
i
will
expose
you
or
i
will
beat
you
up
or
i
will
print
something
in
the
newspaper
about
you.”
in
no
instance
is
this
particular
type
of
conduct
prosecutable
either
by
extortion
or
under
the
bribery
statute.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
assuming
the
facts
as
your
honor
has
stated
them
and
i
certainly
defer
to
your
judgment
in
the
area,
i
think
that
it
would,
there
is
no
question
in
my
mind.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
no,
i
will
assert
that
it
would.
yes,
i
will
admit
and
in
other
states
it
could
result
in
a
conviction
if
their
statute
were
drawn
differently.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
no
sir,
it
would
not.
and
i
say
that
most
respectfully.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
i
think
really
that
the
prosecution
that
you
have
just
mentioned
and
the
fact
that
a
successful
prosecution
may
be
obtained
in
california
under
these
same
set
of
facts
was
not
within
the
intention
with
the
purview
of
the
individuals
who
drew
the
travel
act.
i
think
this
is
a
bonus
that
frankly,
they
never
considered
for
reasons
that
i
would
like
to
set
forth.
in
pennsylvania,
there
is
absolutely
no
question
but
that
the
set
of
circumstances
described
in
the
bill
of
indictment
could
not
have
resulted
in
a
conviction
for
the
crime
of
extortion
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
pennsylvania.
the
united
states
government
admits
this
in
this
instance
because
the
government
when
it
drew
the
bills
of
indictment
as
set
forth
in
the
appendix
charges
in
the
to
which
section
that
the
defendants
have
committed
not
the
crime
of
extortion
as
the
act
requires
but
two
different
crimes
of
blackmail
in
pennsylvania.
and
from
this
jumping
off
point
with
the
understanding
that
under
no
circumstances
could
these
defendants
had
been
convicted
in
pennsylvania
of
the
crime
of
extortion
or
bribery,
i
would
like
to
adopt
for
just
one
moment
if
i
may
the
example
used
by
my
brother
at
the
bar,
the
average
man.
now
here
comes
the
average
man
and
have
used
the
travel
act
of
1961
which
is
an
act
in
its
philosophical
content
which
is
designed
to
do
many
things
to
straighten
out
the
country.
but
of
course,
we're
limited
to
what
it
says
and
let
us
assume
for
one
moment
hypothetically
because
we
cannot
counsel
people
to
commit
crimes
and
very
seldom
can
we
give
them
much
good
counsel
after
they
have
committed
it.
but
let's
assume
running
through
the
mind
of
the
average
man
who
was
supposed
to
understand
the
law
and
to
whom
the
known
certainty
of
the
law
is
the
safety
of
all
whether
or
not
if
he
takes
time
to
examine
it,
he
is
able
to
conclude
clearly
and
beyond
any
doubt
and
without
any
vagueness
that
his
intended
or
past
conduct
is
a
violation
of
the
travel
act.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
i
frankly
sir
do
not
think
that
the
average
congressman
ever
even
thought
of
this
particular
type
of
activity.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
do.
as
defined
by
the
government
in
this
instance.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
i
will
have
to
admit
that.
i
will
have
to
admit
that
under
one
definition
it
was.
but
may
i
respectfully
suggest
that
the
key
term
here
is
not
extortion.
if
extortion
were
left
alone
in
this
statute,
i
would
not
be
before
this
court.
extortion
was
not
left
alone
in
this
statute.
extortion
was
further
modified
by
a
term
“in
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
state
wherein
committed.”
and
at
the
time
this
was
passed,
the
travel
act,
the
united
states
congress
had
to
be
aware
of
a
fact
set
forth
in
the
government's
brief
that
there
are
at
least
17
of
the
50
states
that
define
extortion
as
pennsylvania
does.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
no
sir,
i
cannot.
there
is
a
complete
negation
of
the
legislative
history
in
this
area.
we
must
arrive
--
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
i
do
feel
that
if
the
word
extortion
were
not
modified
by
congress
was
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
state
it
would
have
covered
this
circumstance.
i
do
further
feel
that
if
congress
had
specifically
intended
these
or
this
particular
type
of
activity
to
be
covered
under
this
act,
he
could
have
defined
extortion
as
it
did
in
the
hobbs
act.
it
set
forth
an
entire
descriptive
term
of
exactly
what
the
conduct
was
that
it
was
proscribing.
i
further
suggest
fully
--
respectfully
point
out
to
this
court
or
urge
upon
it,
that
by
not
doing
that
and
that
by
limiting
the
term
extortion
by
the
words
“in
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
state”
congress
meant
that
what
was
the
result
was
not
uniformity
but
the
diversion
or
the
divisiveness
that
was
already
present
in
the
united
states
among
the
various
states.
now
why?
the
only
reason
that
i
can
suggest
again
by
hindsight
and
i
suppose
this
is
the
greatest
scheme
of
imagination
that
a
lawyer
can
play
is
that
extortion
and
bribery
have
a
common
bond
and
the
common
bond
is
governmental
corruption.
in
either
one
of
those,
the
forces
of
local
government
have
to
be
corrupted.
let
us
back
off
just
one
step.
congress
did
not
by
the
passage
of
the
travel
act
intend
to
expand
either
the
definition
of
crime
or
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
government
or
anything
else.
the
travel
act
is
wedded
body
and
soul
to
state
law.
if
the
state
law
does
not
declare
it
to
be
a
crime
regardless
of
the
conduct,
it
is
not
a
crime
under
the
travel
act.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
no
sir,
i
would
not
because
--
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
the
distinction
there
sir
is
that
what
the
government
is
doing
is
picking
out
an
element
which
is
a
part
and
a
clear
part
of
a
larger
crime
that
is
theft.
larceny
is
one
of
three
sections
of
theft
according
to
the
definition
presently
before
us.
in
this
instance,
extortion
is
not
that
and
this
is
not
extortionate
conduct.
i
respectfully
suggest
that
there
is
no
clearer
way
that
congress
could
have
said
extortion
using
the
word
in
its
technical
sense
in
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
state.
if
extortion
were
part
of
a
larger
overall
generic
conglomeration
of
bribery
and
extortion
and
blackmail,
and
congress
had
used
the
word,
i
would
admit
as
i
do
in
the
hypothetical
posed
by
your
honor
that
they
would
have
been
guilty
under
this
particular
section
but
that
is
not
the
case
here.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
that
is
correct.
and
in
17,
it
would
not.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
the
same
conduct.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
correct
and
i
think
really
that
we
have
faced
the
problem
but
the
problem
is
precisely
this.
we
cannot
assume
congress
did
not
know
it.
we
have
to
assume
that
congress
did
know
it
and
did
what
it
did
not
to
provide
uniformity
but
to
take
into
account
the
existing
law
in
the
states.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
i
think
that
certainly
is
true
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
label
or
the
intention
or
the
purpose
behind
almost
everything.
but
now,
let
us
be
very
realistic
for
a
moment
although
no
one
knows
much
about
organized
crime
in
this
country
except
what
we
read
in
law
review
articles
and
life
magazine.
but
nowhere
--
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
there
are
some
law
review
articles
that
go
perhaps
a
bit
beyond
that
sir
and
some
other
treatises.
one,
i
beg
to
point
out
that
the
president's
crime
commission
at
least
the
last
one,
had
i
understand
a
very
intimate
knowledge
of
the
workings
of
one
smaller
city
in
pennsylvania
when
it
mentioned
the
city
by
the
name
of
wyncote.
i
understand
that
was
a
label
to
apply
to
a
city
in
pennsylvania
so
we
cannot
assume
that
they
were
completely
ignorant
of
them.
but
really
what
they're
attempting
to
cut-off
is
the
income
at
least
as
i
have
heard
it
defined
here
from
people
who
are
far
more
expert
in
this
area
than
i.
from
organized
crime,
i
have
never
heard
of
two
private
citizens
who
have
a
relationship
such
as
exists
here
where
one
says
to
the
other,
if
you
do
not
pay
me
$500.00
or
$5,000.00,
i
will
accuse
you
of
being
a
homosexual.
i
have
never
heard
of
this
being
a
part
of
organized
crime
or
putting
a
dollar
in
the
organized
crime
comforts.
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
there
may
very
well
be,
sir.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
i
wouldn't
deny
that
sir.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
i
would
not
deny
that.
but
i
would
say
most
respectfully
that
what
i
have
not
heard
of
is
that
the
money
when
it
is
paid
going
to
organized
crime.
i
have
never
heard
of
this
particular
scheme
which
i
certainly
admit
exists
being
a
tool
of
organized
crime
and
i
respectfully
suggest
to
you
that
a
clear
reading
of
this
act
indicates
only
one
thing,
and
that
is
that
congress
never
heard
of
it
either
even
when
it
passed
this
act.
and
when
it
included
--
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
that
may
well
be
sir.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
that
may
--
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
well
then,
may
i
respectfully
suggest
that
--
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
may
i
respectfully
suggest
sir
that
if
congress
did
have
this
knowledge
--
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
that
if
congress
did
have
this
knowledge
they
did
not
include
it
within
the
statute,
if
this
really
was
an
important
factor
in
congres's
mind,
they
did
a
very
poor
job
of
including
it
within
the
statute.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
congress
has
done
it,
may
i
respectfully
say
sir,
in
the
hobbs
act
which
they
passed
just
a
short
time
before.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
i
understand
that.
all
i
am
saying
is
that
congress
had
the
right,
the
power
and
the
ability
to
define
extortion.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
extortion
does.
there's
no
question
about
it.
extortion
in
its
widest
terms
includes
everything.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
when
you
say
cover,
if
you
may
take
into
account
that
they
are
different
and
recognize
that
difference
in
the
act,
yes
i
do
admit
that.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
if
you're
asking
me
if
i
feel
that
congress
meant
by
this
term
extortion,
to
include
just
generally
extortionate
conduct,
no
sir
i
do
not.
i
think
that
they
intended.
they
recognized
the
problem
that
there
were
different
definitions
in
different
states
and
they
wanted
to
let
them
alone.
now,
they
cover
in
all
50
states
that
type
of
extortionate
conduct
which
deals
with
governmental
officials.
i
know
of
no
state
that
is
exempt
under
the
breakdown
supplied
by
the
government
or
anyone
else.
in
anyone
of
the
50
states,
extortion
certainly
defines
any
act
of
crime
by
which
a
governmental
official
is
corrupt
and
so
does
bribery.
and
what
i
am
suggesting
to
this
court
by
hindsight
that
congress
intended
to
do
was
to
ensure
that
local
governments
were
able
to
cope
with
the
problem
and
once
having
assured
that
to
withdraw
the
federal
government
from
the
field
of
law
enforcement
in
this
area
and
really
that
makes
us
much
sense
as
the
travel
act
because
the
travel
act
does
not
create
anything
that
is
a
new
crime.
the
travel
act
merely
says
that
if
you
travel
in
interstate
commerce
to
commit
a
crime
in
violation
of
the
law
of
the
state,
you
have
committed
a
separate
federal
offense.
now,
in
this
instance,
these
people
could
very
well
have
been
arrested
and
prosecuted
in
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
am
informed
that
some
of
them
were.
exactly
who,
when
and
where
i
do
not
know
and
it
is
outside
of
the
record.
but
there
is
no
reason
in
the
world
that
these
people
could
not
be
convicted
of
a
crime,
if
indeed
they
committed
it
and
if
indeed
the
prosecution
took
place
in
effect
or
in
accordance
with
the
accepted
rules
of
criminal
procedure
and
recognize
their
rights.
we
are
not
saying
that
these
people
should
walk
the
street.
what
we
are
doing
is
trying
to
define
what
congress
said
in
this
act.
and
i
respectfully
suggest
that
it
makes
just
as
much
sense
to
believe
that
congress
intended
to
recognize
that
there
were
differences
among
the
various
states
when
it
said
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
state
wherein
committed.
and
when
it
said
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
state,
to
me
this
means
a
little
bit
more
than
in
definition
of
the
laws
of
the
state.
we
may
have
other
procedural
problems
built
in
within
a
state
like
the
statute
of
limitations
or
even
other
things
beyond
the
imagination,
i
think
that
congress
clearly
intended
when
it
said
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
state
just
that
that
if
this
was
not
a
type
of
activity
that
was
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
a
state,
it
could
not
be
an
unlawful
activity
for
purposes
of
this
particular
act.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
i
think
that
by
virtue
of
the
--
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
i'm
sorry
mr.
--
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
in
my
opinion,
it
could
sir.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
in
my
opinion,
congress
could
make
a
criminal
law
that
congress
of
the
federal
government
could
punish.
i
don't
know
that
they
could
create
a
violation
of
the
state
law.
i
think
that's
another
problem.
i
don't
think
that
the
defined
conduct
would
necessarily
be
a
violation
of
the
law
of
new
jersey
or
pennsylvania
but
it
could
in
my
opinion
be
violation
of
the
federal
law
if
congress
chose
to
do
it.
i
think
they've
done
that
with
the
hobbs
act.
they
have
defined
extortion
to
include
the
generally
accepted
term
of
extortion
and
they
have
provided
criminal
penalties
therefore.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
regardless
of
the
laws
of
pennsylvania.
now,
in
this
instance,
they
did
not
do
that
and
they
said
specifically
that
this
is
only
a
crime
in
those
states
where
it
is
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
those
states.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
that
is
correct
sir.
that
is
exactly
what
i
am
saying
here.
i
think
that
congress
had
the
ability
and
the
power
and
the
knowledge
to
broaden
the
statute
to
where
we
seem
by
hindsight
today
to
feel
that
it
will
be
more
effective.
but
for
some
reason,
they
did
not.
i
really
hate
to
defend
what
they
did
because
i
know
so
little
about
it.
i
don't
know
what
their
intention
was
at
the
time.
we
have
heard
that
there
was
an
intention
to
water
this
down
by
saying
that
the
extortion
and
the
bribery
should
pertain
only
to
gambling
offenses
and
prostitution.
and
if
there
was
an
objection
to
this
and
that
was
removed
but
we
really
don't
know
what
was
in
the
mind
of
congress
when
they
passed
it
except
by
a
clear
reading
of
it.
and
the
average
man
if
i
may
return
again
to
him
who
has
to
read
these
things
i
respectfully
suggest
could
just
as
easily
come
to
the
conclusion
that
this
type
of
conduct
in
pennsylvania
is
not
a
violation
of
the
travel
act
and
the
average
could
certainly
do
it
--
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
of
violation
of
the
laws
of
pennsylvania,
it
clearly
is
and
there
is
absolutely
no
question
but
that
this
complaint
of
conduct
here
was
the
violation
of
the
laws
of
pennsylvania.
what
this
court
really
has
to
decide
is
whether
the
federal
government
should
punish
it
or
pennsylvania
should
punish.
assuming
something
in
future,
what
i
might
respectfully
point
out
to
this
court
that
if
the
united
states
district
court
judge
could
come
to
the
conclusion
that
this
is
not
a
violation
of
the
laws
of
pennsylvania
from
reading
it,
so
could
our
average
man
and
really
the
vagueness
provision
in
this
instance
if
we're
getting
that
far
into
it
is
something
that
violates
basic
rights.
if
congress
intended
that
extortion
should
mean
extortionate
conduct
or
covered
these
set
of
circumstances,
they
had
the
full
power
to
do
it.
but
they
did
not.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
the
hobbs
act
sir
is
cited
in
the
court's
opinion.
i
believe
i
do
not
have
the
page
at
the
moment.
i
remember
reading
it,
page
25
mr.
lacovara
tells
me.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
the
term
extortion
means
the
obtaining
of
property
from
another
with
his
consent
induced
by
wrongful
use
of
action
or
a
threatened
force
violence
or
fear
or
under
collar
of
official
right
and
that
certainly
if
it
were
here,
i
would
not
have
the
pleasure
of
appearing
before
this
court.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
i
do
not
know
independently,
the
courts
speak
of
it
as
being
an
earlier
but
i
do
not
know
how
much
earlier
than
the
travel
act
sir.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
i
do
not
believe,
i
must
disagree
respectfully
with
my
brother,
when
he
tells
the
court
that
the
interpretation
as
imposed
upon
this
section
by
the
united
states
district
court
would
seriously
hamper
the
government's
attempt
to
wipe
out
interstate
crime
particularly
organized
crime.
with
all
due
respect,
i
once
again
say
factually
that
i
do
not
know
and
have
not
seen
widely
circulated
at
least
that
this
particular
type
of
extortion
is
at
least
as
large
a
tool
of
organized
crime
as
prostitution
as
gambling,
as
liquor
law
violations,
as
loan
sharking
really.
and
i
think
that
what
the
government
is
trying
to
do
in
this
particular
section
of
the
travel
act,
in
this
one
little
section
with
the
exception
of
arson
which
was
added
later,
is
to
ensure
that
local
law
enforcement
is
able
through
non-corrupt
officials
to
deal
with
these
and
with
many
other
problems
that
would
be
outside
this
thing.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
i
think
it
would,
i
think
at
least
those
sections
of
it
sir
that
it
have
to
deal
with
the
violence,
with
the
threatened
violence
of
loan
sharking
would
be
reached
by
another
section
of
the
law.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
the
one
that
is
not
quoted
widely
herein,
subsection
2
of
section
1952,
“commit
any
crime
of
violence
to
further
any
unlawful
activity.”
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
would
not
include
loan
sharking,
you're
quite
correct.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
i
apologize.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
well,
therein
lies
a
very
difficult
problem
if
a
man
owes
a
debt.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
not
necessarily
if
i
could
respectfully
just
for
a
moment
and
this
had
not
--
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
yes.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
no
problem.
but
the
state
laws
that
deal
with
loan
sharking
do
not
do
--
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
i
would
have
no
problem
with
that.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
it
was
at
time
--
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
loan
sharking
is
illegal
under
those
sections
of
state
law
at
least
in
pennsylvania
which
have
to
do
with
the
charging
of
unlawful
interest.
if
a
person
loans
money
and
it
is
repaid
and
the
interest
in
pennsylvania
does
not
exceed
6%
per
annum,
simple
it
is
not
loan
sharking.
there
are
of
course
numerous
exceptions
but
the
only
vehicle
that
pennsylvania
has
to
deal
with
loan
sharking
has
to
do
with
the
charging
of
excessive
interest.
and
really
it
comes
under
our
banking
code.
it
is
not
in
pennsylvania
a
criminal
offense.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
pardon
me.
it
is
not
under
the
criminal
code,
it
is
a
criminal
offense.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
i
would
have--
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
it
would
not
at
that
time
sir
but
i
would
frankly
have
less
problem
with
that
i
would
with
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical
were.
this
was
part
of
a
larger
overall
crime
where
you
had
a
conglomeration
of
sections.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
yes
sir
but
in
my
opinion
--
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
not
as
i
understood
it
sir.
as
i
understood
the
government's
argument
in
this
case,
it
was
that
congress
intended
this
to
include
something
broader
than
it
said
and
we
are
not
really
dealing
here
with
a
loan
sharking
situation.
we
are
dealing
here
with
not
an
undefined
area
of
crime
either,
if
i
might
respectfully
point
out.
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
specific
violation
of
a
law
of
pennsylvania.
the
crime
in
pennsylvania
that
was
committed
here
was
a
blackmail
by
accusation
of
heinous
crime.
it
is
a
specific
statute
in
pennsylvania.
it
is
not
an
undefined
thing
that's
used
to
be
part
of
something
else.
it's
a
specific
statute
and
it
was
never
even
in
the
common
law
included
under
the
term
of
extortion.
now,
extortion
has
certainly
today
expanded
and
i
have
to
admit
it
and
it
can
include
almost
anything
that
comes
close
to
the
area.
i
have
to
admit
that
too.
what
i
cannot
concede
that
congress
even
though
it
recognized
this
as
an
average
man,
as
a
good
lawyer,
as
a
good
legislative
research
man
that
congress
intended
by
the
language
that
it
used
here
to
apply
this
definition
of
extortion.
it
could
have
done
so,
so
easily
in
a
number
of
other
different
ways
but
it
did
not.
in
this
instance,
it
said
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
state
and
it
had
to
mean
something
by
that
term.
a
limitation
as
it
appears
at
least
in
this
instance
what
that
term
had
to
mean
something.
if
they
had
not
put
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
a
state,
once
again
i
don't
think
i
would
be
before
this
court
even
though
they
had
just
used
the
term
extortion.
i
don't
think
i
would
have
gotten
beyond
the
district
court
with
the
argument
if
it
were
to
be
made
at
all.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
well
--
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
it
unless
sir,
the
rare
circumstances
that
it
would
go
to
new
york
for
the
pay
off
or
that
some
would
come
to
philadelphia
to
pay
off
a
judge
or
a
legislator
or
the
chief
of
police.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
but
there
could
be
circumstances
particularly
in
a
city
like
philadelphia
that
as
bad
as
i
seen.
in
one
instance
here,
the
individuals
were
accused
of
coming
from
camden
which
is
of
course
across
the
river
now.
one
of
these
defendants
lived
in
camden
and
in
a
circumstance
like
that,
it
might
very
well
be
that
someone
who
had
a
gambling
operation
in
philadelphia
might
live
in
camden
and
might
pay
off
a
police
official
and
we
might
get
them
under
the
provisions
under
this
act
in
this
fashion.
i
see
my
time
is
--
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
i
once
again
must
agree
that
the
term
extortion
does
do
that
to
me
sir.
i
cannot
stand
before
this
court
and
take
an
unreasonable
position.
but
i
once
again
must
point
out
that
in
my
opinion,
the
limiting
phrase
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
state
must
mean
something
also.
and
if
it
does
in
pennsylvania
at
least,
it
limits
it
not
to
this
kind
of
activity.
and
what
i
respectfully
point
out
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
that
i
just
read
this
morning,
i
believe
they
quoted
professor
wexler
who
had
almost
the
opposite
to
say
about
this
statute
that
it
was
not
very
meaningful
and
that
it
did
not
reach
out,
it
did
not
do
the
things
that
some
of
its
proponents
have
thought
that
it
should
do.
the
purpose
of
it
i
think
is
noble
and
i
have
no
objection
to
that
and
i
really
have
no
objection
to
those
sections
of
it
which
are
clear
but
i
cannot
in
my
own
mind
rationalize
that
congress
intended
to
do
that
which
that
it
could
have
done
so
easily
by
the
language
that
it
used
in
this
instance.
perhaps
congress
did
not
intend
it.
and
in
that
vagueness
i
think
is
the
reason
why
the
district
court
felt
that
it
should
fall
and
the
reason
why
i
urge
upon
you
that
you
sustain
the
action
the
district
court
in
this
matter.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
no
sir,
i
would
not.
i
would
clearly
not
if
the
congress
here
had
intended
my
opinion
to
outlaw
extortionate
activity.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
i
think
--
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
whether
they
would
get
a
3%
or
not
is
something
i
really
don't
want
to
get
involved
with
the
bankers
over
because
i
know
nothing
about
it.
but
i
do
think
that
if
congress
felt
that
it
would
aid
in
its
drive
on
organized
crime
or
aid
some
other
noble
purpose,
they
would
pass
such
a
statute.
now,
that
again
would
depend
upon
the
circumstances
at
the
time.
what
i
should
hope
that
if
they
did
pass
that
they
would
not
put
in
the
language
which
is
so
vague
and
confusing
as
they
have
in
this
case
that
they
would
say
exactly
what
they
meant.
thank
you.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
law
of
pennsylvania
in
its
definition
of
extortion
is
not
a
new
or
unusual
definition.
it
tracks
very
closely
if
i
may
borrow
a
term
from
the
district
court's
opinion,
the
common
law
definition
of
extortion
and
it
requires
without
getting
any
more
detailed
than
is
necessary
for
purposes
of
this
argument
that
at
least
one
of
the
parties
involved
in
an
exchange
of
money
to
do
something
must
be
an
individual
who
is
a
public
officer
and
a
public
officer
who
has
something
to
do
with
the
reason
why
the
money
is
passed.
this
statute
was
applied
in
pennsylvania
to
prosecute
when
they
are
discovered
officials
who
have
breached
their
duty,
their
sacred
trust
to
the
public
and
have
accepted
a
bribe.
it
is
not
as
it
has
been
characterized
by
the
government
in
its
brief,
in
its
oral
argument
merely
a
statute
that
involves
excessive
fees.
the
excessive
fee
mentioned
is
solely
to
exclude
the
defense
that
while
i
didn't
know
i
could
charge
$2.50
for
$1.50
gold
license.
this
is
the
statute
that
pennsylvania
uses
when
it
is
necessary
to
prosecute
corrupt
officials.
the
crime
of
bribery
in
pennsylvania
is
further
defined
by
the
legislature
and
is
set
down
in
the
penal
code
of
1939
and
that
involves
a
few
different
elements
when
a
bribe
must
be
given
or
accepted
by
certain
enumerated
officials
no
longer
just
an
undefined
quest
of
public
officials
and
it
has
to
do
with
specific
actions
that
they
are
supposed
to
take.
i
might
say
that
by
defining
extortion
i
know
and
by
defining
bribery
i
assume
and
by
all
of
its
definitions
of
common
law
crimes
pennsylvania
has
not
limited
violations
of
these
crimes
to
those
things
which
are
contained
in
the
statute.
there
are
cases
dealing
with
what
pennsylvania
calls
common
law
extortion
and
this
case
is
quite
frankly
are
generally
in
the
area
of
who
should
be
a
public
official.
the
common
law
definition
of
public
official
has
for
some
reason
by
the
courts
been
granted
a
wider
sphere
than
the
statutory
definition
but
in
no
instance,
in
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
is
activity
which
takes
place
between
two
individuals
who
are
not
public
officials,
who
were
not
named
in
the
statute
whereby
one
says
to
the
other,
“if
you
don't
give
me
a
certain
amount
of
money,
i
will
expose
you
or
i
will
beat
you
up
or
i
will
print
something
in
the
newspaper
about
you.”
in
no
instance
is
this
particular
type
of
conduct
prosecutable
either
by
extortion
or
under
the
bribery
statute.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
assuming
the
facts
as
your
honor
has
stated
them
and
i
certainly
defer
to
your
judgment
in
the
area,
i
think
that
it
would,
there
is
no
question
in
my
mind.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
no,
i
will
assert
that
it
would.
yes,
i
will
admit
and
in
other
states
it
could
result
in
a
conviction
if
their
statute
were
drawn
differently.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
no
sir,
it
would
not.
and
i
say
that
most
respectfully.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
i
think
really
that
the
prosecution
that
you
have
just
mentioned
and
the
fact
that
a
successful
prosecution
may
be
obtained
in
california
under
these
same
set
of
facts
was
not
within
the
intention
with
the
purview
of
the
individuals
who
drew
the
travel
act.
i
think
this
is
a
bonus
that
frankly,
they
never
considered
for
reasons
that
i
would
like
to
set
forth.
in
pennsylvania,
there
is
absolutely
no
question
but
that
the
set
of
circumstances
described
in
the
bill
of
indictment
could
not
have
resulted
in
a
conviction
for
the
crime
of
extortion
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
pennsylvania.
the
united
states
government
admits
this
in
this
instance
because
the
government
when
it
drew
the
bills
of
indictment
as
set
forth
in
the
appendix
charges
in
the
to
which
section
that
the
defendants
have
committed
not
the
crime
of
extortion
as
the
act
requires
but
two
different
crimes
of
blackmail
in
pennsylvania.
and
from
this
jumping
off
point
with
the
understanding
that
under
no
circumstances
could
these
defendants
had
been
convicted
in
pennsylvania
of
the
crime
of
extortion
or
bribery,
i
would
like
to
adopt
for
just
one
moment
if
i
may
the
example
used
by
my
brother
at
the
bar,
the
average
man.
now
here
comes
the
average
man
and
have
used
the
travel
act
of
1961
which
is
an
act
in
its
philosophical
content
which
is
designed
to
do
many
things
to
straighten
out
the
country.
but
of
course,
we're
limited
to
what
it
says
and
let
us
assume
for
one
moment
hypothetically
because
we
cannot
counsel
people
to
commit
crimes
and
very
seldom
can
we
give
them
much
good
counsel
after
they
have
committed
it.
but
let's
assume
running
through
the
mind
of
the
average
man
who
was
supposed
to
understand
the
law
and
to
whom
the
known
certainty
of
the
law
is
the
safety
of
all
whether
or
not
if
he
takes
time
to
examine
it,
he
is
able
to
conclude
clearly
and
beyond
any
doubt
and
without
any
vagueness
that
his
intended
or
past
conduct
is
a
violation
of
the
travel
act.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
i
frankly
sir
do
not
think
that
the
average
congressman
ever
even
thought
of
this
particular
type
of
activity.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
do.
as
defined
by
the
government
in
this
instance.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
i
will
have
to
admit
that.
i
will
have
to
admit
that
under
one
definition
it
was.
but
may
i
respectfully
suggest
that
the
key
term
here
is
not
extortion.
if
extortion
were
left
alone
in
this
statute,
i
would
not
be
before
this
court.
extortion
was
not
left
alone
in
this
statute.
extortion
was
further
modified
by
a
term
“in
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
state
wherein
committed.”
and
at
the
time
this
was
passed,
the
travel
act,
the
united
states
congress
had
to
be
aware
of
a
fact
set
forth
in
the
government's
brief
that
there
are
at
least
17
of
the
50
states
that
define
extortion
as
pennsylvania
does.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
no
sir,
i
cannot.
there
is
a
complete
negation
of
the
legislative
history
in
this
area.
we
must
arrive
--
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
i
do
feel
that
if
the
word
extortion
were
not
modified
by
congress
was
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
state
it
would
have
covered
this
circumstance.
i
do
further
feel
that
if
congress
had
specifically
intended
these
or
this
particular
type
of
activity
to
be
covered
under
this
act,
he
could
have
defined
extortion
as
it
did
in
the
hobbs
act.
it
set
forth
an
entire
descriptive
term
of
exactly
what
the
conduct
was
that
it
was
proscribing.
i
further
suggest
fully
--
respectfully
point
out
to
this
court
or
urge
upon
it,
that
by
not
doing
that
and
that
by
limiting
the
term
extortion
by
the
words
“in
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
state”
congress
meant
that
what
was
the
result
was
not
uniformity
but
the
diversion
or
the
divisiveness
that
was
already
present
in
the
united
states
among
the
various
states.
now
why?
the
only
reason
that
i
can
suggest
again
by
hindsight
and
i
suppose
this
is
the
greatest
scheme
of
imagination
that
a
lawyer
can
play
is
that
extortion
and
bribery
have
a
common
bond
and
the
common
bond
is
governmental
corruption.
in
either
one
of
those,
the
forces
of
local
government
have
to
be
corrupted.
let
us
back
off
just
one
step.
congress
did
not
by
the
passage
of
the
travel
act
intend
to
expand
either
the
definition
of
crime
or
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
government
or
anything
else.
the
travel
act
is
wedded
body
and
soul
to
state
law.
if
the
state
law
does
not
declare
it
to
be
a
crime
regardless
of
the
conduct,
it
is
not
a
crime
under
the
travel
act.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
no
sir,
i
would
not
because
--
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
the
distinction
there
sir
is
that
what
the
government
is
doing
is
picking
out
an
element
which
is
a
part
and
a
clear
part
of
a
larger
crime
that
is
theft.
larceny
is
one
of
three
sections
of
theft
according
to
the
definition
presently
before
us.
in
this
instance,
extortion
is
not
that
and
this
is
not
extortionate
conduct.
i
respectfully
suggest
that
there
is
no
clearer
way
that
congress
could
have
said
extortion
using
the
word
in
its
technical
sense
in
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
state.
if
extortion
were
part
of
a
larger
overall
generic
conglomeration
of
bribery
and
extortion
and
blackmail,
and
congress
had
used
the
word,
i
would
admit
as
i
do
in
the
hypothetical
posed
by
your
honor
that
they
would
have
been
guilty
under
this
particular
section
but
that
is
not
the
case
here.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
that
is
correct.
and
in
17,
it
would
not.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
the
same
conduct.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
correct
and
i
think
really
that
we
have
faced
the
problem
but
the
problem
is
precisely
this.
we
cannot
assume
congress
did
not
know
it.
we
have
to
assume
that
congress
did
know
it
and
did
what
it
did
not
to
provide
uniformity
but
to
take
into
account
the
existing
law
in
the
states.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
i
think
that
certainly
is
true
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
label
or
the
intention
or
the
purpose
behind
almost
everything.
but
now,
let
us
be
very
realistic
for
a
moment
although
no
one
knows
much
about
organized
crime
in
this
country
except
what
we
read
in
law
review
articles
and
life
magazine.
but
nowhere
--
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
there
are
some
law
review
articles
that
go
perhaps
a
bit
beyond
that
sir
and
some
other
treatises.
one,
i
beg
to
point
out
that
the
president's
crime
commission
at
least
the
last
one,
had
i
understand
a
very
intimate
knowledge
of
the
workings
of
one
smaller
city
in
pennsylvania
when
it
mentioned
the
city
by
the
name
of
wyncote.
i
understand
that
was
a
label
to
apply
to
a
city
in
pennsylvania
so
we
cannot
assume
that
they
were
completely
ignorant
of
them.
but
really
what
they're
attempting
to
cut-off
is
the
income
at
least
as
i
have
heard
it
defined
here
from
people
who
are
far
more
expert
in
this
area
than
i.
from
organized
crime,
i
have
never
heard
of
two
private
citizens
who
have
a
relationship
such
as
exists
here
where
one
says
to
the
other,
if
you
do
not
pay
me
$500.00
or
$5,000.00,
i
will
accuse
you
of
being
a
homosexual.
i
have
never
heard
of
this
being
a
part
of
organized
crime
or
putting
a
dollar
in
the
organized
crime
comforts.
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
there
may
very
well
be,
sir.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
i
wouldn't
deny
that
sir.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
i
would
not
deny
that.
but
i
would
say
most
respectfully
that
what
i
have
not
heard
of
is
that
the
money
when
it
is
paid
going
to
organized
crime.
i
have
never
heard
of
this
particular
scheme
which
i
certainly
admit
exists
being
a
tool
of
organized
crime
and
i
respectfully
suggest
to
you
that
a
clear
reading
of
this
act
indicates
only
one
thing,
and
that
is
that
congress
never
heard
of
it
either
even
when
it
passed
this
act.
and
when
it
included
--
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
that
may
well
be
sir.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
that
may
--
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
well
then,
may
i
respectfully
suggest
that
--
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
may
i
respectfully
suggest
sir
that
if
congress
did
have
this
knowledge
--
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
that
if
congress
did
have
this
knowledge
they
did
not
include
it
within
the
statute,
if
this
really
was
an
important
factor
in
congres's
mind,
they
did
a
very
poor
job
of
including
it
within
the
statute.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
congress
has
done
it,
may
i
respectfully
say
sir,
in
the
hobbs
act
which
they
passed
just
a
short
time
before.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
i
understand
that.
all
i
am
saying
is
that
congress
had
the
right,
the
power
and
the
ability
to
define
extortion.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
extortion
does.
there's
no
question
about
it.
extortion
in
its
widest
terms
includes
everything.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
when
you
say
cover,
if
you
may
take
into
account
that
they
are
different
and
recognize
that
difference
in
the
act,
yes
i
do
admit
that.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
if
you're
asking
me
if
i
feel
that
congress
meant
by
this
term
extortion,
to
include
just
generally
extortionate
conduct,
no
sir
i
do
not.
i
think
that
they
intended.
they
recognized
the
problem
that
there
were
different
definitions
in
different
states
and
they
wanted
to
let
them
alone.
now,
they
cover
in
all
50
states
that
type
of
extortionate
conduct
which
deals
with
governmental
officials.
i
know
of
no
state
that
is
exempt
under
the
breakdown
supplied
by
the
government
or
anyone
else.
in
anyone
of
the
50
states,
extortion
certainly
defines
any
act
of
crime
by
which
a
governmental
official
is
corrupt
and
so
does
bribery.
and
what
i
am
suggesting
to
this
court
by
hindsight
that
congress
intended
to
do
was
to
ensure
that
local
governments
were
able
to
cope
with
the
problem
and
once
having
assured
that
to
withdraw
the
federal
government
from
the
field
of
law
enforcement
in
this
area
and
really
that
makes
us
much
sense
as
the
travel
act
because
the
travel
act
does
not
create
anything
that
is
a
new
crime.
the
travel
act
merely
says
that
if
you
travel
in
interstate
commerce
to
commit
a
crime
in
violation
of
the
law
of
the
state,
you
have
committed
a
separate
federal
offense.
now,
in
this
instance,
these
people
could
very
well
have
been
arrested
and
prosecuted
in
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
am
informed
that
some
of
them
were.
exactly
who,
when
and
where
i
do
not
know
and
it
is
outside
of
the
record.
but
there
is
no
reason
in
the
world
that
these
people
could
not
be
convicted
of
a
crime,
if
indeed
they
committed
it
and
if
indeed
the
prosecution
took
place
in
effect
or
in
accordance
with
the
accepted
rules
of
criminal
procedure
and
recognize
their
rights.
we
are
not
saying
that
these
people
should
walk
the
street.
what
we
are
doing
is
trying
to
define
what
congress
said
in
this
act.
and
i
respectfully
suggest
that
it
makes
just
as
much
sense
to
believe
that
congress
intended
to
recognize
that
there
were
differences
among
the
various
states
when
it
said
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
state
wherein
committed.
and
when
it
said
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
state,
to
me
this
means
a
little
bit
more
than
in
definition
of
the
laws
of
the
state.
we
may
have
other
procedural
problems
built
in
within
a
state
like
the
statute
of
limitations
or
even
other
things
beyond
the
imagination,
i
think
that
congress
clearly
intended
when
it
said
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
state
just
that
that
if
this
was
not
a
type
of
activity
that
was
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
a
state,
it
could
not
be
an
unlawful
activity
for
purposes
of
this
particular
act.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
i
think
that
by
virtue
of
the
--
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
i'm
sorry
mr.
--
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
in
my
opinion,
it
could
sir.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
in
my
opinion,
congress
could
make
a
criminal
law
that
congress
of
the
federal
government
could
punish.
i
don't
know
that
they
could
create
a
violation
of
the
state
law.
i
think
that's
another
problem.
i
don't
think
that
the
defined
conduct
would
necessarily
be
a
violation
of
the
law
of
new
jersey
or
pennsylvania
but
it
could
in
my
opinion
be
violation
of
the
federal
law
if
congress
chose
to
do
it.
i
think
they've
done
that
with
the
hobbs
act.
they
have
defined
extortion
to
include
the
generally
accepted
term
of
extortion
and
they
have
provided
criminal
penalties
therefore.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
regardless
of
the
laws
of
pennsylvania.
now,
in
this
instance,
they
did
not
do
that
and
they
said
specifically
that
this
is
only
a
crime
in
those
states
where
it
is
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
those
states.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
that
is
correct
sir.
that
is
exactly
what
i
am
saying
here.
i
think
that
congress
had
the
ability
and
the
power
and
the
knowledge
to
broaden
the
statute
to
where
we
seem
by
hindsight
today
to
feel
that
it
will
be
more
effective.
but
for
some
reason,
they
did
not.
i
really
hate
to
defend
what
they
did
because
i
know
so
little
about
it.
i
don't
know
what
their
intention
was
at
the
time.
we
have
heard
that
there
was
an
intention
to
water
this
down
by
saying
that
the
extortion
and
the
bribery
should
pertain
only
to
gambling
offenses
and
prostitution.
and
if
there
was
an
objection
to
this
and
that
was
removed
but
we
really
don't
know
what
was
in
the
mind
of
congress
when
they
passed
it
except
by
a
clear
reading
of
it.
and
the
average
man
if
i
may
return
again
to
him
who
has
to
read
these
things
i
respectfully
suggest
could
just
as
easily
come
to
the
conclusion
that
this
type
of
conduct
in
pennsylvania
is
not
a
violation
of
the
travel
act
and
the
average
could
certainly
do
it
--
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
of
violation
of
the
laws
of
pennsylvania,
it
clearly
is
and
there
is
absolutely
no
question
but
that
this
complaint
of
conduct
here
was
the
violation
of
the
laws
of
pennsylvania.
what
this
court
really
has
to
decide
is
whether
the
federal
government
should
punish
it
or
pennsylvania
should
punish.
assuming
something
in
future,
what
i
might
respectfully
point
out
to
this
court
that
if
the
united
states
district
court
judge
could
come
to
the
conclusion
that
this
is
not
a
violation
of
the
laws
of
pennsylvania
from
reading
it,
so
could
our
average
man
and
really
the
vagueness
provision
in
this
instance
if
we're
getting
that
far
into
it
is
something
that
violates
basic
rights.
if
congress
intended
that
extortion
should
mean
extortionate
conduct
or
covered
these
set
of
circumstances,
they
had
the
full
power
to
do
it.
but
they
did
not.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
the
hobbs
act
sir
is
cited
in
the
court's
opinion.
i
believe
i
do
not
have
the
page
at
the
moment.
i
remember
reading
it,
page
25
mr.
lacovara
tells
me.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
the
term
extortion
means
the
obtaining
of
property
from
another
with
his
consent
induced
by
wrongful
use
of
action
or
a
threatened
force
violence
or
fear
or
under
collar
of
official
right
and
that
certainly
if
it
were
here,
i
would
not
have
the
pleasure
of
appearing
before
this
court.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
i
do
not
know
independently,
the
courts
speak
of
it
as
being
an
earlier
but
i
do
not
know
how
much
earlier
than
the
travel
act
sir.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
i
do
not
believe,
i
must
disagree
respectfully
with
my
brother,
when
he
tells
the
court
that
the
interpretation
as
imposed
upon
this
section
by
the
united
states
district
court
would
seriously
hamper
the
government's
attempt
to
wipe
out
interstate
crime
particularly
organized
crime.
with
all
due
respect,
i
once
again
say
factually
that
i
do
not
know
and
have
not
seen
widely
circulated
at
least
that
this
particular
type
of
extortion
is
at
least
as
large
a
tool
of
organized
crime
as
prostitution
as
gambling,
as
liquor
law
violations,
as
loan
sharking
really.
and
i
think
that
what
the
government
is
trying
to
do
in
this
particular
section
of
the
travel
act,
in
this
one
little
section
with
the
exception
of
arson
which
was
added
later,
is
to
ensure
that
local
law
enforcement
is
able
through
non-corrupt
officials
to
deal
with
these
and
with
many
other
problems
that
would
be
outside
this
thing.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
i
think
it
would,
i
think
at
least
those
sections
of
it
sir
that
it
have
to
deal
with
the
violence,
with
the
threatened
violence
of
loan
sharking
would
be
reached
by
another
section
of
the
law.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
the
one
that
is
not
quoted
widely
herein,
subsection
2
of
section
1952,
“commit
any
crime
of
violence
to
further
any
unlawful
activity.”
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
would
not
include
loan
sharking,
you're
quite
correct.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
i
apologize.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
well,
therein
lies
a
very
difficult
problem
if
a
man
owes
a
debt.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
not
necessarily
if
i
could
respectfully
just
for
a
moment
and
this
had
not
--
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
yes.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
no
problem.
but
the
state
laws
that
deal
with
loan
sharking
do
not
do
--
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
i
would
have
no
problem
with
that.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
it
was
at
time
--
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
loan
sharking
is
illegal
under
those
sections
of
state
law
at
least
in
pennsylvania
which
have
to
do
with
the
charging
of
unlawful
interest.
if
a
person
loans
money
and
it
is
repaid
and
the
interest
in
pennsylvania
does
not
exceed
6%
per
annum,
simple
it
is
not
loan
sharking.
there
are
of
course
numerous
exceptions
but
the
only
vehicle
that
pennsylvania
has
to
deal
with
loan
sharking
has
to
do
with
the
charging
of
excessive
interest.
and
really
it
comes
under
our
banking
code.
it
is
not
in
pennsylvania
a
criminal
offense.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
pardon
me.
it
is
not
under
the
criminal
code,
it
is
a
criminal
offense.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
i
would
have--
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
it
would
not
at
that
time
sir
but
i
would
frankly
have
less
problem
with
that
i
would
with
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical
were.
this
was
part
of
a
larger
overall
crime
where
you
had
a
conglomeration
of
sections.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
yes
sir
but
in
my
opinion
--
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
not
as
i
understood
it
sir.
as
i
understood
the
government's
argument
in
this
case,
it
was
that
congress
intended
this
to
include
something
broader
than
it
said
and
we
are
not
really
dealing
here
with
a
loan
sharking
situation.
we
are
dealing
here
with
not
an
undefined
area
of
crime
either,
if
i
might
respectfully
point
out.
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
specific
violation
of
a
law
of
pennsylvania.
the
crime
in
pennsylvania
that
was
committed
here
was
a
blackmail
by
accusation
of
heinous
crime.
it
is
a
specific
statute
in
pennsylvania.
it
is
not
an
undefined
thing
that's
used
to
be
part
of
something
else.
it's
a
specific
statute
and
it
was
never
even
in
the
common
law
included
under
the
term
of
extortion.
now,
extortion
has
certainly
today
expanded
and
i
have
to
admit
it
and
it
can
include
almost
anything
that
comes
close
to
the
area.
i
have
to
admit
that
too.
what
i
cannot
concede
that
congress
even
though
it
recognized
this
as
an
average
man,
as
a
good
lawyer,
as
a
good
legislative
research
man
that
congress
intended
by
the
language
that
it
used
here
to
apply
this
definition
of
extortion.
it
could
have
done
so,
so
easily
in
a
number
of
other
different
ways
but
it
did
not.
in
this
instance,
it
said
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
state
and
it
had
to
mean
something
by
that
term.
a
limitation
as
it
appears
at
least
in
this
instance
what
that
term
had
to
mean
something.
if
they
had
not
put
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
a
state,
once
again
i
don't
think
i
would
be
before
this
court
even
though
they
had
just
used
the
term
extortion.
i
don't
think
i
would
have
gotten
beyond
the
district
court
with
the
argument
if
it
were
to
be
made
at
all.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
well
--
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
it
unless
sir,
the
rare
circumstances
that
it
would
go
to
new
york
for
the
pay
off
or
that
some
would
come
to
philadelphia
to
pay
off
a
judge
or
a
legislator
or
the
chief
of
police.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
but
there
could
be
circumstances
particularly
in
a
city
like
philadelphia
that
as
bad
as
i
seen.
in
one
instance
here,
the
individuals
were
accused
of
coming
from
camden
which
is
of
course
across
the
river
now.
one
of
these
defendants
lived
in
camden
and
in
a
circumstance
like
that,
it
might
very
well
be
that
someone
who
had
a
gambling
operation
in
philadelphia
might
live
in
camden
and
might
pay
off
a
police
official
and
we
might
get
them
under
the
provisions
under
this
act
in
this
fashion.
i
see
my
time
is
--
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
i
once
again
must
agree
that
the
term
extortion
does
do
that
to
me
sir.
i
cannot
stand
before
this
court
and
take
an
unreasonable
position.
but
i
once
again
must
point
out
that
in
my
opinion,
the
limiting
phrase
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
state
must
mean
something
also.
and
if
it
does
in
pennsylvania
at
least,
it
limits
it
not
to
this
kind
of
activity.
and
what
i
respectfully
point
out
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
that
i
just
read
this
morning,
i
believe
they
quoted
professor
wexler
who
had
almost
the
opposite
to
say
about
this
statute
that
it
was
not
very
meaningful
and
that
it
did
not
reach
out,
it
did
not
do
the
things
that
some
of
its
proponents
have
thought
that
it
should
do.
the
purpose
of
it
i
think
is
noble
and
i
have
no
objection
to
that
and
i
really
have
no
objection
to
those
sections
of
it
which
are
clear
but
i
cannot
in
my
own
mind
rationalize
that
congress
intended
to
do
that
which
that
it
could
have
done
so
easily
by
the
language
that
it
used
in
this
instance.
perhaps
congress
did
not
intend
it.
and
in
that
vagueness
i
think
is
the
reason
why
the
district
court
felt
that
it
should
fall
and
the
reason
why
i
urge
upon
you
that
you
sustain
the
action
the
district
court
in
this
matter.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
no
sir,
i
would
not.
i
would
clearly
not
if
the
congress
here
had
intended
my
opinion
to
outlaw
extortionate
activity.
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
i
think
--
mr.
f.
emmett
fitzpatrick,
jr.
whether
they
would
get
a
3%
or
not
is
something
i
really
don't
want
to
get
involved
with
the
bankers
over
because
i
know
nothing
about
it.
but
i
do
think
that
if
congress
felt
that
it
would
aid
in
its
drive
on
organized
crime
or
aid
some
other
noble
purpose,
they
would
pass
such
a
statute.
now,
that
again
would
depend
upon
the
circumstances
at
the
time.
what
i
should
hope
that
if
they
did
pass
that
they
would
not
put
in
the
language
which
is
so
vague
and
confusing
as
they
have
in
this
case
that
they
would
say
exactly
what
they
meant.
thank
you.
