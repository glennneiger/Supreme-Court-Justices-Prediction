mr.

chief

we'll
recess
now,
mr.
lacovara,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
am
i
correct
in
my
belief
that
nowhere
in
the
statutes
under
consideration
did
congress
use
the
word
blackmail?
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
you
made
any
study
to
determine
how
many
states
consider
the
facts
in
this
case
as
being
extortion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fitzpatrick.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
this
prosecution
have
taken
place
in
say
in
california
where
this
fact
situation
would
be
covered
by
the
extortion
statute
assuming
that
it
does,
i
believe
it
does,
would
this
conviction
stand?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
assert
that
it
would
that's
just
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then,
wouldn't
that
indicate
that
congress
intended
to
proscribe
this
kind
of
conduct
by
this
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
of
course.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
what
bothers
me
and
what
prompted
my
question
was
this
and
i
know
in
california
and
maybe
in
other
states
too
many
years
ago,
there
was
great
confusion
as
to
what
would
constitute
larceny
as
distinguished
from
larceny
by
trick
and
device
and
from
obtaining
money
under
false
pretenses
and
it
confused
the
courts,
it
confused
everyone
so
they
combined
all
three
and
called
it
theft.
now,
would
you
say
if
the
government
had
said
larceny
in
here
that
in
those
states
where
they
had
called
it
theft
instead
of
larceny
that
it
would
not
be
intended
to
apply?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
is
the
distinction
between
that
and
your
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
understand
here
that
from
this
brief,
the
government
that
there's
some
25
states
i
can't
count
them
all
but
i
think
it's
about
that
where
the
facts
in
this
case
would
be
covered
by
the
word
extortion.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
in
most
states,
you
say
that
this
law
would
be
applicable.
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
though
the
same
conduct
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
wasn't
criminal
in
those
states.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
was
the
purpose
of
congress
in
passing
this
law?
wasn't
it
to
stop
crime
that
in
commerce?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
body
has
a
broader
language
than
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
there
are
others
who
have
heard
of
that
and
i
am
one
of
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
one
of
them
--
the
--
that's
been
an
instrument
of
interstate
crime
for
ages.
this
very
situation
that
you're
talking
about
where
people
will
lure
someone
in
to
a
compromising
position
and
then
threaten
them
that
if
they
don't
--
if
they
don't
come
through
some
money
that
they're
going
to
prosecute
them
for
a
crime
and
assuming
that
they
are
police
officers
themselves,
when
they
are
not
police
officers.
that's
just
as
common
as
this
claim.
chief
justice
earl
warren
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
violation
of
the
laws
of
pennsylvania.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
just
looking
at
what
the
late
robert
kennedy
had
to
say.
he
was
attorney
general
at
that
time
and
his
interpretation
of
this
law
is
that
this
law
has
a
broadest
scope
and
the
greatest
potential
of
the
new
anti-racketeering
statutes.
now,
wouldn't
that
indicate
to
you
that
they
meant
the
term
extortion
not
be
a
limited
term
but
a
term
that
would
incorporate
a
meaning
of
extortion
as
it
is
known
in
any
part
of
the
united
states?
