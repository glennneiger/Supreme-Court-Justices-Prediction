mr.
fitzpatrick,
how
about
the
average
congressman,
do
you
think
when
he
put
this
word
extortion
in
there
he
did
or
did
not
intend
to
cover
this
specific
act?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
that
it's
unreasonable
to
think
that
congress
intended
extortion
to
mean
what
it
was
generally
understood
to
cover
in
1961?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
believe
that
in
1961,
the
word
extortion
in
this
generic
sense
in
his
understanding
at
that
time
was
broad
enough
to
cover
the
facts
in
this
indictment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
say
--
can
you
point
to
any
of
the
legislative
history
the
said
congress
was
aware
of
that
fact?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
don't
believe
that
the
general
understanding
at
that
time
would
have
covered
this,
the
word
extortion?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
respectfully
suggest
that
you
should
read
some
of
the
material
that
was
given
to
congress
before
this
bill
was
passed.
justice
thurgood

justice
thurgood
marshall
you
going
to
say
that
it's
not
in
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
say
--
i
suppose
congress
should
have
said
that
if
somebody
holds
somebody
up
and
threatens
to
expose
them
unless
they
pay
money,
that
will
be
a
crime.

justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
said
that
in

the
vagrancies
