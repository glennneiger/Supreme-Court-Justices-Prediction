what
decided
--
we
can
decide
it
here.
justice
william
o.
douglas
get
back
to
the
--
that's
the
question
of
federal
law.
the
patent
is
a
federal
creation.
the
state
of
california
couldn't
issue
a
patent,
could
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
so,
we're
dealing
with
a
federal
--
in
the
federal
domain
right
from
the
beginning?
justice
william
o.
douglas
to
a
federal
concept?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
our
decisions
have
--
go
right
in
the
face
of
what
you've
said
because
our
decisions
wholly
cannot
--
the
parties
by
private
agreement
cannot
enlarge
the
concept
of
the
patent.
justice
william

well,
we
have
the
words
of
the
contract
for
us
to
construe
those

justice
william
o.
douglas
really,
what
for?
contract
that
relating
to
patents
as
a
state
question?
justice
william
o.
douglas
could
you
give
a
memorandum
to
us
on
that
because
we
do
not
have
a
lot
of
cases
in
this
field
and
this
is
the
first
time
anybody
has
stood
there
and
had
the
temerity
to
make
that
suggestion?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
not
this
case.
this
is
something
that
is
assumed
to
be
patented
or
patentable.
justice
william

well,

might
