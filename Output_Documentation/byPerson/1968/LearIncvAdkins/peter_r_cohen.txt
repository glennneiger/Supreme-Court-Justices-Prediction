mr.
peter
r.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
it
is
important
to
show
in
this
case
that
lear
never
properly
raised
or
preserved
the
question
of
whether
licensee
estoppel
violates
either
the
patent
laws
or
the
antitrust
laws.
although
mr.
wallace
for
the
government
referred
the
court
to
pages
25
to
28
of
one
of
lear's
reply
briefs
where
lear
had
quoted
the
constitutional
standard
for
invention
and
the
sections
of
the
patent
laws
dealing
with
validity.
he
did
not
read
far
enough
from
that
portion
of
the
brief.
in
that
section
after
quoting
those
provisions
what
lear
was
arguing
was
only
that
the
federal
laws
including
the
constitutional
standard
had
to
be
applied
in
determining
the
question
of
validity.
that
portion
did
not
in
any
way
assert
that
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
was
invalid
and
that
it
violated
either
the
patent
laws
or
the
antitrust
laws.
in
fact,
at
page
75
of
that
same
brief,
lear
had
a
separate
section
dealing
with
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
in
which
lear
conceded
that
the
doctrine
was
applicable
in
this
case
unless
it
fell
within
one
of
two
exceptions.
one
being
termination
and
the
other
being
repudiation.
i
have
xerox
copies
of
the
brief
that
mr.
wallace
referred
to
pages
18
to
26
and
i
have
handed
them
to
the
clerk
this
morning
for
this
court
to
consider
if
it's
so
desires.
now,
i
offer
now
a
copy
to
the
government.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
it's
18
through
28.
in
fact,
the
government
concedes
in
its
amicus
brief
that
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
violates
either
the
patent
laws
or
the
antitrust
laws
was
not
timely
raised
or
preserved
in
this
case.
at
page
8,
the
government
says
as
follows,
“this
court
need
not
be
deterred
from
reaching
this
issue,
licensee
estoppel
by
the
fact
that
petitioner's
contentions
in
the
state
courts
were
directed
primarily
to
attempting
to
carve
out
an
exception
to
the
doctrine
rather
than
to
its
overturn.”
because
of
this
court's
decision
upholding
the
doctrine
at
automatic
radio
co.
versus
hazeltine
it
would
have
been
futile
for
the
petitioner
to
argue
broadly
to
the
state
courts
that
federal
law
bars
the
states
from
applying
the
doctrine
of
patent
licensee
estoppel.
moreover,
lear
has
conceded
in
the
state
court
system
that
the
rule
of
licensee
estoppel
was
applicable
unless
lear
fell
within
one
of
two
state
exceptions.
the
best
statement
of
this
concession
appears
at
page
109
of
lear's
answering
brief
in
the
california
district
court
which
is
quoted
at
page
120
of
the
appendix
before
this
court
and
which
states
as
follows,
“it
is
a
recognized
principle
of
law
that
when
a
license
agreement
provides
a
grant
of
a
right
to
either
manufacture,
use
or
sell
a
product
incorporating
a
patented
invention,
the
licensee
is
estopped
to
contest
the
validity
of
the
license
patent
only
so
long
as
the
licensee
is
operating
under
the
license.”
this
is
not
only
the
modern
rule
as
plaintiff
likes
to
call
it
but
as
also
the
old
rule
as
well.
this
rule
was
set
out
in
the
1939
case
of
the
armstrong
co.
versus
the
shell
company
of
california
which
was
a
california
court
opinion.
lear
then
goes
on
to
say
this
estoppel
as
only
so
long
as
the
licensee
operates
under
the
license
agreement.
this
estoppel
arises
not
because
of
the
expressed
terms
in
the
agreement
but
because
the
licensee
is
using
and
enjoying
the
benefit
and
protection
of
the
right
covered
by
the
agreement
and
should
not
be
permitted
to
reap
the
benefits
of
the
agreement
and
at
the
same
time
contest
the
validity
of
the
patents
to
show
failure
of
consideration
for
the
agreement.

on
the
merits
and
this
appears
at

mr.

mr.
peter

cohen

mr.
peter
r.
cohen
it
should
be
volume
1,
appendix
volume
1.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
yes
it
did
rely
on
it
to
assert
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
that's
correct.
it
was
never
raised
in
the
state
system
whatsoever.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
the
passage
in
the
brief
that
was
read
to
you
yesterday
was
dealing
primarily
in
fact
exclusively
with
the
constitutional
standard
and
the
patent
laws
insofar
as
they
concern
the
standard
for
invention.
there
was
nothing
said
there
about
licensee
estoppel
and
particularly
nothing
said
about
whether
it
violates
either
the
antitrust
laws
or
the
patent
laws.
that
section
was
dealing
solely
with
the
validity
question
and
what
the
standard
was
for
determining
the
validity
of
a
patent.
i
think
this
is
clear
from
page
28
where
after
quoting
the
constitutional
provision
and
the
patent
standard
set
forth
in
sections
101,
102,
103
and
subsequent
sections.
they
conclude
that
this
test
must
be
applied
in
determining
validity
but
there's
no
statement
there
concerning
licensee
estoppel
or
whether
those
standards
have
to
be
applied
in
determining
whether
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
violates
either
the
patent
laws
or
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
i'm
saying
they
did
not
raise
with
any
specificity
was
the
question
of
whether
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
per
se
violates
either
policy
of
the
antitrust
laws
of
the
policy
of
the
patent
laws.
this
question
was
never
raised
in
the
trial
court
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
--
or
in
the
appellate
courts.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
not
on
this
issue
because
this
issue
was
never
raised.
it
was
--
i
assume
just
conceded
that
the
doctrine
was
applicable
whether
or
not
it
was
state
law.
but
in
trying
to
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
if
it
was
decided
assuming
it
is
essential
to
the
decision
and
it
is
essential
to
the
decision
only
in
a
very
narrow
respect
but
i
would
assume
that
if
it
hadn't
been
properly
raised
that
would
not
be
properly
before
this
court.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
would
assume
that
the
court
had
decided
it
as
a
question
of
state
law
because
it
was
not
raised
as
a
federal
question
and
in
trying
to
carve
out
exceptions
to
the
doctrine
in
that
lear
had
claimed
that
either
terminated
or
repudiated
the
agreement
lear
stated
that
these
were
state
exceptions
to
the
doctrine.
so
that
i
would
gather
that
it
was
more
or
less
assumed
all
the
way
along
the
line
that
what
was
being
applied
was
a
state
doctrine
since
it
was
never
questioned
under
the
federal
laws
in
any
way.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
it
has
been
a
controversy
before
this
court,
yes
but
it
arose
in
this
case
in
the
context
that
lear
conceded
the
applicability
of
the
rule
and
then
contended
only
that
they
fell
within
two
so-called
state
exceptions
that
they
had
either
terminated
the
agreement
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
they
conceded
that
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
was
applicable
without
saying
any
place
in
the
state
system
whether
it
was
state
or
federal
but
by
the
fact
that
they
tried
to
use
so-called
state
exceptions
to
come
without
the
rule.
they
probably
also
conceded
that
it
was
a
state
doctrine
although
i
admit
that
it
was
never
specified
which
one
it
was.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
that's
right.
what
they
conceded
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
no,
they
did
not
do
that
in
the
pleadings.
they
did
this
in
a
brief
on
appeal
and
also
in
a
brief
in
the
trial
court
in
which
they
conceded
the
applicability
of
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
and
so
that
to
bring
themselves
within
two
exceptions
thereto.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
would
have
to
assume
they
did
because
they
never
questioned
that
it
was
applicable.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
can
refer
you
to
page
120
of
the
appendix.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
appendix
number
1,
yes
and
also
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
volume
1,
yes.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
that's
correct.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
on
page
120,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
i
would
assume
that
under
the
procedural
rules
that
have
been
laid
down
by
this
court
that
unless
the
issue
is
timely
raise
as
a
federal
question,
it
is
too
late
to
raise
it
in
this
court.
now,
it
went
through
the
entire
california
system
without
any
question
to
the
applicability
of
the
doctrine.
there
was
no
federal
question
presented,
rather
there
was
only
an
attempt
to
carve
out
state
exceptions
to
this
rule
on
the
theory
that
lear
had
either
terminated
the
agreement
by
sending
notice
of
termination
or
had
repudiated
the
agreement.
and
on
both
those
issues,
lear
took
the
position
that
that
was
state
law
and
since
they
were
applying
it
to
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
i
would
assume
that
they
also
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
i
think
it
is
because
the
only
federal
questions
that
were
raised
below
were
in
connection
with
the
application
of
the
federal
standards
for
patentability
which
never
really
became
an
issue
in
the
california
supreme
court
because
it
applied
the
doctrine
licensee
estoppel.
so,
unless,
the
court
can
reach
the
issue
of
licensee
estoppel,
it
can't
go
any
further
than
that.
and
if
that's
decided
solely
on
a
state
ground
as
a
matter
of
state
contract
law
then
the
federal
patent
issues
which
were
raised
never
arise
in
this
case.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
yes,
that
is
on
the
party
of
the
issues.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
what
the
other
issues
are?
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
the
other
issue
was
primarily
the
construction
of
the
contract
and
lear's
attempts
to
avoid
the
contract
by
saying
that
it
either
terminated
or
repudiated.
and
thereby
get
itself
into
the
federal
court
system
in
a
pure
suit
for
infringement
and
the
california
supreme
court
devoted
a
good
part
of
its
time
to
determining
whether
or
not
they
had
terminated
the
contract.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
no,
i
don't
think
it
does
because
i
don't
think
it
is
in
the
pure
and
technical
sense,
a
patent
contract.
it
relates
to
patent
events
to
a
certain
extent
but
it
is
more
concerned
with
a
bargain
for
the
disclosure
of
an
invention
in
return
for
the
payment
of
a
royalty
for
the
disclosure
of
that
invention.
that
is
the
real
basis
of
that
bargain
which
i
will
get
to
as
i
get
further
in
to
my
argument.
now,
just
as
the
issue
relating
to
the
question
of
licensee
estoppel
is
not
properly
before
this
court,
in
my
opinion,
similarly
the
issue
of
patent
validity
is
not
before
this
court
for
several
reasons.
first,
if
the
issue
of
licensee
estoppel
is
not
before
this
court,
it
cannot
reach
this
dependent
question.
second,
the
issue
of
validity
was
not
one
of
the
five
questions
presented
in
lear's
petition
for
certiorari.
it
is
also
third,
not
a
necessarily
included
question
under
rule
23
(1)
(c).
fourth,
the
california
supreme
court
did
not
consider
the
issue
of
validity
and
under
settled
procedural
rules
of
this
court
will
not
normally
pass
on
questions
in
the
first
instance
without
the
lower
courts
having
first
undertaking
to
decide
those
issues.
in
fact,
the
government
urges
at
page
26
of
its
amicus
brief
that
if
the
issue
of
validity
must
to
be
reached
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
california
supreme
court
for
consideration
of
this
issue.
consequently,
in
my
view
because
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
was
never
properly
raised
as
a
federal
issue
and
the
doctrine
of
the
validity
of
a
patent
is
consequently
not
before
the
court.
the
result
should
be
that
this
petition
be
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
what
i
think
it
was
doing,
was
using
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
that
it
decided
on
state
grounds
because
it
did
so
in
connection
with
the
construction
of
an
agreement
and
although
it
used
the
words
licensee
estoppel
or
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel.
it
was
really
using
those
words
as
a
shorthand
method
of
summing
up
what
it
had
already
determined
on
the
contract
namely
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
that's
right.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
would
assume
that
walker
cites
probably
state
cases
and
federal
cases
as
well.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
would
assume
he
does
but
in
those
cases
it
may
well
have
been
that
what
the
federal
court
was
doing
was
applying
local
line
at
diversity
case
on
a
contract
action
line.
first,
they
wouldn't
know
that
reading
the
case
but
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
when
you
say
that
federal
law
governed
that
the
doctrine
is
a
federal
doctrine
rather
than
a
state
doctrine
licensee
estoppel.
i've
been
assuming
all
along
that
the
doctrine
is
one
of
state
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
oh!
i
think
federal
limitations
would
have
to
control
the
doctrine.
this
court
has
held
that
but
that
is
only
in
a
misused
situation.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
i
think
what
it
was
doing
was
saying
was
one
interpreting
the
contract
and
then
saying
as
a
shorthand
method
that
what
they're
really
saying
is
licensee
estoppel
really
means
that
lear
has
estopped
to
question
the
bargain
that
it
freely
entered
into
in
that
in
making
the
bargain,
it
did
not
make
conclusive
validity
of
the
patent
one
of
the
considerations
for
the
bargain.
and
therefore,
since
failure
of
--
since
invalidity
of
the
patent,
would
not
cause
a
failure
consideration.
it
should
not
be
a
defense.
in
other
words,
the
party
has
never
bargain
with
respect
to
the
validity
of
the
patent.
and
therefore,
it
should
not
be
a
defense
if
it's
invalid
because
it
could
not
affect
the
bargain
of
the
parties.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
correct.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
whether
they
may
go
too
far
because
of
an
overriding
federal
policy
but
we're
confined
to
the
narrow
situation
and
there's
no
misuse
of
the
patent.
i
think
it
remains
just
a
state
question
until
there
is
some
transgression
of
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
perhaps
that
patent
laws
but
i
don't
really
see
how
patent
laws
come
in
to
play
here
especially
in
the
context
of
this
case
because
the
bargain
was
really
not
for
“patents
or
patent
rights”
the
essence
of
the
bargain
as
i
will
get
to
it
in
a
minute
was
that
lear
received
a
disclosure
from
adkins
of
an
idea,
discovery
and
invention
for
which
they
agreed
to
pay
him
as
long
as
they
continue
to
use
it
subject
to
three
conditions
subsequent.
now,
those
conditions
subsequent
were,
one,
if
no
patent
issue.
two,
if
a
patent
issue
with
claims
which
did
not
cover
the
inventions
they
were
using
in
the
2156
california
gyro
and
the
michigan
steel
gyros.
and
three,
if
the
patent
was
held
invalid
in
third
party
action.
so,
although
they
tie
this
escape
hatches
to
what
might
happen
under
the
patent
laws
they
were
really
just
a
way
of
reducing
lear's
liability
under
the
agreement
to
continue
to
pay
until
the
expiration
of
the
patent.
and
since
none
of
these
conditions
has
occurred,
there
of
course
belong
to
the
party.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
it
did
say
that
in
paragraph
2
(a).
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
no,
no
i'm
not
suggesting
you
ignore
that.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
think
you
first
have
to
read
paragraph
2
(a)
with
paragraph
1
(b)
in
order
to
determine
what
lear
was
in
effect
licensee
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
no,
i'm
not
saying
that
at
all.
i'm
saying
that
when
you
read
paragraph
2
(a)
with
paragraph
1
(b)
what
lear
licensed
was
the
invention
disclosed
or
intended
to
be
disclosed
and
by
use
of
the
words
if
patentable
they
were
bargaining
for
what
the
patent
office
might
do
or
what
some
third
party
might
do
to
the
patent
and
third
party
adjudication.
but
they
were
not
bargaining
that
they
themselves
could
contest
the
validity
of
a
patent
and
thereby
avoid
the
bargain.
in
other
words,
they
were
saying
in
effect
that
if
the
patent
does
an
issue
or
if
the
claims
don't
cover
what
we're
making
or
third
party
holds
it
invalid
and
therefore
it
can
use
it
free
that
we
should
also
be
able
to
use
it
free.
and
under
those
conditions
only
we
can
terminate
but
the
validity
between
us
is
decided
by
what
the
patent
office
will
do
in
the
first
instance
in
issuing
or
not
issuing
a
patent.
i
think
that
was
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
no,
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
we're
not
for
this
reason
in
my
view
and
that
is
when
they
tied
their
bargain
to
patentability.
they
were
tying
it
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
--
to
that
standard
for
--
but
only
for
one
purpose
not
to
control
the
rights
vis-a-vis
adkins
and
lear
but
to
likely
or
out
of
the
contract
in
the
event
that
a
patent
didn't
issue
and
somebody
else
could
therefore
use
it.
in
other
words,
their
bargain
was,
we
will
pay
you
for
this
invention
which
we
have
an
inclusive
right
to
use
subject
to
conditions
subsequent
which
are
if
no
patent
issues
or
if
the
claims
are
not
substantial
and
don't
cover
the
inventions
we're
making
--
the
devices
we're
making
or
if
it's
held
invalid
in
third
party
adjudication.
but
only
subject
to
those
three
conditions
can
we
get
out.
other
than
that,
our
bargain
is
founded
upon
your
disclosure
mr.
adkins
of
the
invention
and
our
use
of
the
invention
for
which
we
agreed
to
pay
the
royalty.
so
that
the
patent
laws
are
really
not
involved
in
this
bargain
except
to
the
extent
that
lear's
escape
hatches
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i'm
sure
that's
true,
they
cannot
tie
something
else
to
the
patent
or
broaden
their
rights
on
the
patent
where
they
are
dealing
per
se
with
a
patent
right.
but
the
party
is
here,
we're
not
concerned
in
the
initial
basis
of
the
bargain
with
the
patent
laws.
the
basis
of
the
bargain
was
the
right
to
use
the
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
would
think
in
the
first
instance
it
would
be
a
question
of
state
law
for
the
california
supreme
court
to
construe
what
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
insofar
as
it
relates
to
what
the
consideration
for
the
contract
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
think
i
have
outlined
the
cases
in
my
brief
the
one
that
comes
to
mind
in
particular
is
this
court's
opinion
in
the
case
of
brulotte
versus
thys
where
the
court
was
considering
the
use
of
a
patent
to
exact
a
royalty
after
the
expiration
of
the
patent
by
tying
it
to
the
license
of
the
patent
and
where
the
court
when
faced
with
the
question
of
what
would
happen
if
the
parties
have
made
a
contract
for
a
machine
which
was
not
patented
whether
or
not
this
would
involved
federal
law.
and
the
court
there
said,
“the
sale
or
a
lease
of
unpatented
machines
on
long-term
payments
based
on
a
deferred
purchase
price
or
on
use
would
present
wholly
different
considerations.”
those
arrangements
seldom
rise
to
the
level
of
a
federal
question.
so
i
assume
that
what
the
court
is
saying
where
the
parties
are
contracting
with
respect
to
something
which
is
an
unpatented
invention.
they
are
free
to
make
any
bargain
they
care
to
make
about
it
as
long
as
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
yes
but
as
i'm
trying
to
say
when
they
used
the
word
“patented
or
patentable”
on
paragraph
2
(a),
2
(a)
expressly
refers
to
1
(b)
for
further
definitions
of
the
term
used
and
it
defines
claims
as
including
the
invention
disclosed
or
intended
to
be
disclosed
in
specification
of
the
application
and
that
lear
is
taking
a
license
of
the
invention
which
adkins
disclosed
or
intended
to
disclose
not
with
the
claims
under
the
patent.
so
that
he
merely
used
the
specifications
to
define
the
invention
rather
than
to
take
a
license
of
claims
under
an
application.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
perhaps
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
no,
i'm
not
really
saying
quite
that.
i'm
saying
that
as
interpreted
by
the
california
supreme
court
the
basis
of
the
bargain
between
adkins
and
lear
was
not
a
federal
patent
right.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
don't
believe
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
no,
i
don't
think
that's
my
theory
perhaps
i'm
not
stating
as
i
should
be
stating
but
what
i'm
trying
to
get
across
is
that
the
basis
of
the
bargain
between
adkins
and
the
lear
was
not
the
grant
by
adkins
to
lear
of
a
federal
patent
right.
it
was
rather
indeed
disclosure
by
adkins
of
an
invention
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
that
it's
a
probably
unique
contract.
i
doubt
if
there
will
even
be
another
one
like
it
because
of
the
way
the
contract
arose.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
oh!
yes
including
disclosed
or
intended
to
be
disclosed.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
that's
right.
it
did
anti
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
yes,
i
don't
deny
related
to
the
federal
patent
but
the
question
is
the
way
it
related
to
that
federal
patent.
as
the
california
supreme
court
held,
lear
was
not
concerned
prior
to
the
issuance
of
the
patent
with
particular
claims
in
the
application,
what
they
were
licensing
was
the
invention
either
disclosed
or
intended
to
be
disclosed
in
the
specifications
without
regard
to
the
claims
for
which
they
agreed
to
pay
until
final
patent
office
action.
and
that
further
when
final
patent
office
action
occurred
if
a
patent
issue
they
would
have
to
continue
to
pay
regardless
or
whether
that
patent
was
valid
or
not
valid
because
that
was
no
part
of
the
bargain
between
the
parties
but
however
if
the
patent
did
not
issue
then
they
would
have
the
right
to
seize
paying
further
royalties
because
in
that
situation
then
a
third
party
would
be
free
to
use
the
invention
also.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
you
mean
could
lear
have
used
it
together
with
something
else?
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
in
that
situation,
i
would
assume
that
since
adkins
had
no
control
over
what
lear
used
it
for
that
it
would
no
rise
to
the
level
of
a
federal
question.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
no,
no
i
think
i'm
saying
just
the
opposite.
adkins
could
not
and
did
not
tie
this
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
because
then
if
you
tie
something
in
whether
the
contract
involves
a
patent
or
not
i
would
assume
you
get
involved
with
the
antitrust
laws.
for
example,
you
can
have
conspiracies
to
violate
the
antitrust
laws
that
don't
involved
patents.
similarly,
i
would
assume
you
can
have
agreements
which
violate
the
antitrust
laws
irrespective
other
patents
involved.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
you
mean
where
they
had
agreed
in
the
first
instance
that
if
a
patent
issue
or
did
not
issue
they
would
renegotiate
it?
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
yes.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
no,
i
didn't
say
it
having
nothing
to,
i
said,
it
was
tied
to
it
to
allow
certain
escape
hatches
to
lear
to
get
out
of
the
bargain
if
certain
events
occurred.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
in
my
view,
that's
all
and
in
the
view
of
the
california
supreme
court
if
i
interpret
their
opinion
correctly
that's
all
they
were
involved
with.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
the
patent
was
not
incidental,
it
was
involved
to
the
extent
that
lear's
escape
clauses
are
conditions
subsequent
were
tied
to
what
might
happen
in
the
patent
office
or
in
some
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
third
party
adjudication.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
that's
correct.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i'm
trying
to
tell
you
in
my
view
how
far
i
think
it
is
involved
and
i
think
it
is
involved
only
to
the
extent
that
the
condition
subsequent
under
which
lear
can
avoid
the
payment
of
further
royalties
are
tied
to
the
patent
laws.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
and
no
more.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
i
don't
see
how
they
could
be
following
federal
law
in
this
area.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
really
don't
know
what
they
would've
come
up
with
had
the
question
been
presented
as
one
of
federal
law.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
i
they
recognized
licensee
estoppel,
the
automatic
radio
versus
hazeltine
case
is
probably
the
best
example
of
it.
that's
the
most
recent
decision
in
which
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
per
se
was
upheld
in
1950
after
first
finding
that
there
was
no
patent
misuse.
the
cases
go
all
the
way
back
to
kinsman
versus
parkhurst
in
1855.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
that's
what
i'm
not
so
sure
because
i'm
not
so
sure
that
in
the
cases
that
we've
been
talking
about
the
hazeltine
and
the
kinsman
and
all
the
other
cases
that
they
weren't
applying
that
this
court
wasn't
saying
that
this
state
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
there's
nothing
wrong
with
it
as
long
as
you
don't
use
it
to
transgress
the
antitrust
laws
in
some
way.
i
think
that's
what
they're
after
and
i
think
that's
what
the
hazeltine
opinion
makes
clear
that
assuming
that
a
patent
right
is
involved,
as
long
as
that
patent
right
is
not
misused
either
by
price
fixing
or
tie-ins
or
conspiracies
to
restrain
trade.
then,
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
can
be
applied
and
in
fact
should
be
applied.
i
would
assume
it
is
being
applied
to
enforce
the
bargain
of
the
parties.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
think
that
would
probably
interfere
with
their
right
to
contract
freely
with
each
other
because
the
parties
of
course
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
no,
i
don't
think
it
would.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
because
the
parties
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
because
the
parties
here
at
the
outset
when
they
made
this
bargain
in
1955
were
free
to
contract
as
they
wished.
they
could've
provide
it
in
the
contract
that
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
i
thought
that
in
the
hypothetical
you
post,
you
were
saying
that
the
laws
that
they
could
not
contest
validity.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
that
forecloses
the
parties
from
bargaining
as
to
whether
they
deem
the
validity
of
the
patent
to
be
material
or
not.
so,
for
that
reason,
i
would
say
that
law
is
probably
invalid.
however,
in
this
case
in
1955,
lear
could
very
easily
had
it
been
concerned
with
the
question
of
validity
inserted
a
clause
in
the
agreement
saying,
we
reserve
the
right
to
contest
the
validity
of
this
patent
if
it
issues
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
--
and
if
it's
invalid
we
don't
have
to
pay.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
don't
think
the
federal
law
gives
in
that
right.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
no,
no
and
i
don't
think
it
gives
them
that
right
because
what
the
parties
we're
dealing
with
here
was
not
the
patent
laws
and
the
patent
rights
per
se.
they
were
dealing
with
the
disclosure
of
an
invention
for
which
lear
agreed
to
pay.
at
the
time
it
was
disclosed
it
was
secret,
they
didn't
know
about
it.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
because
i
understand
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
think
he
can
contract
to
purchase
a
bear
idea
or
a
discovery
regardless
of
whether
it's
patented
or
patentable.
this
is
a
question
of
state
contract
law
and
what's
consideration
for
a
contract.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
that
maybe
where
this
court
is
trying
to
go
to
say
that
you
must
engraft
upon
every
agreement
which
deals
with
something
which
is
capable
of
being
patented
a
provision
that
the
parties
cannot
make
a
bargain
unless
they
condition
it
first
on
obtaining
a
patent
and
second
condition
that
upon
the
patent
being
valid.
now,
that
maybe
where
the
court
wants
to
go
but
i
would
submit
that
that's
a
very
harsh
result
to
take
away
from
the
parties
the
free
right
to
make
any
contract
they
wish
with
the
respect
to
an
idea
or
a
discovery
even
if
it
doesn't
arise
to
the
dignity
of
something
that
is
patentable
under
the
federal
patent
laws.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
the
fall
back
on
the
patent
for
one
reason
and
that
is
to
show
that
lear
did
not
come
within
the
conditions
subsequent
it
said
if
a
patent
did
not
issue,
they
didn't
have
to
pay
for
the
royalties.
that's
the
only
extent
to
which
we
rely
on
the
patent
in
this
case
other
than
the
fact
that
the
claims
cover
the
2156
california
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
i
think
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
--
in
this
case
i
think
that
even
if
you
overturn
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
and
held
the
patent
to
be
invalid
that
that
would
not
end
adkins'
rights
under
this
contract
because
it
is
interpreted
by
the
california
supreme
court
the
parties
themselves
were
not
concerned
with
the
validity
or
invalidity
of
the
patent
and
therefore
since
they
did
not
make
this
a
part
of
their
bargain.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
it
appears
at
page
182
of
appendix
1
in
footnote
17.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
yes,
your
honor.
and
reading
from
footnote
17,
california
supreme
court
states,
“lear
states
that
the
license
extended
only
to
validly
patented
claims,
however,
the
provisions
of
the
agreement
setting
forth
the
scope
of
the
license
do
not
so
state.”
the
validity
of
the
patent
was
adverted
to
in
the
agreement
only
in
connection
with
the
right
to
terminate
if
the
patent
“was
subsequently
held
invalid.”
and
the
court
goes
on
to
say
that
page
209
of
that
appendix
the
cause
is
based
on
rights
emanating
from
a
written
agreement
and
the
patent
itself
is
referred
to
only
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
lear
used
the
invention
therein
set
forth.
i
think
that
makes
a
pretty
clear
that
what
the
california
court
was
saying
that
even
if
the
patent
was
invalid
it
would
not
cut
off
lear's
right
or
lear's
obligation
to
pay
royalties
in
this
case
because
they
weren't
bargaining
between
themselves
adkins
and
lear
for
a
conclusively
valid
patent.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
that
it's
only
couch
in
terms
of
the
normal
formal
patent
license
agreement.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
but
i
think
you
can
distinguish
it
in
this
way,
taking
the
typical
situation
first
a
holder
of
either
an
application
for
a
patent
or
a
patent
would
go
to
a
manufacturer
and
say,
the
manufacturer
was
either
using
or
intending
to
use
what
he
thinks
is
covered
by
the
application
of
the
patent.
let's
say
you
either
pay
me
a
royalty
or
i
will
sue
you
for
infringement
of
this
patent.
and
in
that
situation
which
is
the
typical
situation
the
force
behind
the
bargain
is
the
threat
of
the
supposed
patent
right
and
that
is
probably
the
main
force
in
causing
the
bargain
to
be
made
assuming
or
leaving
to
the
one
aside
the
desirability
the
parties
to
settle
but
still
the
main
force
is
the
same.
it's
the
existence
or
the
expected
existence
are
the
patent
right
under
the
federal
law.
this
case
did
not
arise
that
way.
it
arose
rather
with
an
agreement
dated
december
29,
1951
between
adkins
and
lear
which
is
one
page
in
length
as
copied
verbatim
at
page
11
of
the
appendix
in
which
adkins
agreed
to
disclose
the
lear
“all
ideas
inventions
and
discoveries
which
he
might
conceive
of
which
lear
agreed
expressly
would
be
adkins
property
and
adkins
then
agreed
to
license
it
to
lear
for
a
mutually
satisfactory
royalty.”
this
agreement
made
no
mention
of
patents,
patent
rights
or
patentability
to
the
contrary.
the
existence
of
a
patent
or
patent
right
under
this
agreement
was
totally
irrelevant
then
pursuant
to
that
agreement
adkins
went
to
work
for
lear
and
did
invent
something
which
they
wanted
and
when
it
look
to
lear
like
it
was
going
to
be
commercially
successful
they
said
to
themselves,
well,
we
have
to
do
something
about
this
first
agreement
because
under
state
law
he
will
collect
that
reasonable
royalty.
so
the
result
was
that
they
begin
negotiation
with
them
that
went
over
a
three-year
period
and
resulted
in
this
license
agreement.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
i
don't
think
it
is
yet.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
that's
right.
he
was
not
represented
by
counsel.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
the
california
supreme
court
of
course
said
that
he
was
represented
by
counsel.
however,
as
i
stated
in
the
brief
he
was
not
in
fact
represented
by
counsel.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
right,
now
actually
what
happened
there
was
at
the
time
adkins
joined
lear
he
did
have
one
issue
of
patent
and
he
started
negotiations
with
the
lawyer
with
lear
with
respect
to
that
issue
of
patent
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
thereafter,
adkins
and
lear
started
discussing
this
license
agreement
which
adkins
alone
negotiated
with
lear
and
in
the
course
of
so
doing
they
merged
that
other
agreement
with
this
one.
so
that
there
were
several
parts
of
the
same
agreement,
so
he
was
initially
represented
on
another
face
of
it
nothing
to
do
with
this
particular
invention.
i
think
it's
also
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
it
comes
down
to
that
yes
together
with
additional
considerations
which
i
think
make
it
clear
under
the
terms.
i'm
not
on
the
1951
agreement,
but
the
1955
agreement
exactly
what
lear
received.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
basically,
an
analysis
of
all
the
considerations
that
lear
was
bargaining
for
and
that
adkins
was
giving
up
with
reference
to
the
first
agreement.
not
of
which
considerations
had
anything
to
do
with
either
the
power
of
force
behind
the
patent
or
patent
application
or
a
patent
or
a
patent
right
except
to
the
extent
that
conditions
subsequent
where
title
lear's
obligation
to
pay
royalties.
that's
the
only
extent
that
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
would
suggest
that
this
is
not
the
typical
case
and
probably
would
never
come
up
again
for
one
practical
reason
that
most
if
not
all
corporations
when
they
employ
an
inventor
make
him
sign
an
agreement
in
advance
of
his
coming
to
work
that
whatever
he
invents
will
belong
to
the
company.
this
is
the
atypical
situation
because
they
signed
an
agreement
exactly
to
the
contrary.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
perhaps
it's
not
but
it's
also
the
key
to
understanding
the
consideration
which
flowed
from
adkins
to
lear
and
vise
versa
under
the
55
agreement
which
concededly
was
couched
in
terms
of
a
formal
patent
license
agreement.
and
if
i
may
just
dwell
on
that
for
another
moment,
i'd
like
to
analyze
if
i
could
exactly
what
the
considerations
are
that
lear
received
under
this
1955
agreement.
first,
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
sorry?
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
the
55,
yes
sir.
first,
lear
received
the
exclusive
uncontested
and
immediate
right
to
use
the
secret
idea
discovering
invention
which
adkins
had
disclosed
until
final
patent
office
action.
note,
that
i
say
exclusive
and
not
nonexclusive
because
the
license
agreement
was
in
fact
expressly
exclusive
contrary
to
what
the
solicitor
general
states
in
his
brief,
it
started
out
as
an
exclusive
license
not
a
nonexclusive
license.
second,
lear
received
the
cancellation
of
the
letter
agreement
that
december
29,
1951
under
which
his
liability
to
adkins
was
far
broader
than
under
the
agreement
that
replaced
it.
under
that
agreement
pursuant
to
california
law,
particularly
a
case
known
as
desny
versus
wilder
which
is
california
supreme
court
case
cited
in
my
brief.
based
on
that
agreement,
the
court
would
find
that
there
was
an
implied
contract
between
the
parties
for
lear
to
take
the
mutually
satisfactory
royalty
which
it
would
have
determined
was
a
reasonable
royalty
and
under
that
agreement,
lear
would
be
bound
to
pay
as
long
as
lear
use
the
device
without
any
escape
hatches
or
condition
subsequent
termination
clauses
whatsoever.
and
that
brings
to
the
third
point.
third
thing
that
lear
got
under
this
agreement
was
the
right
to
seize
payment
of
“for
the
royalties”
if
no
patent
issued
or
if
it
issue
which
claims
which
did
not
cover
the
gyros
in
issue
or
some
third
party
held
it
invalid.
and
fourth
and
equally
important,
there
were
two
additional
agreements
signed
concurrently
with
this
license
agreement
which
are
attached
to
lear's
answer
and
are
on
appendix
a
at
pages
40
to
45
wherein
lear
in
addition
to
receiving
the
right
to
use
the
invention
disclosed
in
the
patent
application
also
received
a
release
from
adkins
of
all
other
and
different
ideas,
discoveries
and
invention
which
he
may
have
created
for
the
year
past,
present
and
future
as
long
as
he
work
for
the
year.
so
that
this
was
the
consideration
that
lear
was
concerned
for
and
was
bargaining
for
as
the
california
supreme
court
recognized
it
was
not
bargaining
in
addition
for
a
conclusively
valid
patent
under
which
it
could
say
that
the
patent
was
invalid
and
therefore
we
don't
have
to
pay.
its
sole
rights
were
under
the
very
carefully
drawn
condition
subsequent.
i
think
it's
also
important
in
this
case
to
understand
that
when
adkins
went
to
work
for
lear
in
january
of
1952
after
signing
this
first
letter
agreement,
he
went
to
work
for
what
the
president
of
lear
incorporated
described
his
“coffee
and
cake
money”
which
was
$650.00
a
month.
thus,
adkins
real
reward
under
this
initial
bargain
was
to
be
dependent
upon
his
successors
and
inventor
and
after
spending
approximately
six
months
experimenting
with
a
bearing
on
as
a
self-aligning
type
bearing
he
concluded
that
that
approach
to
the
problem
would
not
work
after
which
he
conceived
of
the
invention
which
is
the
subject
matter
of
this
case
and
fully
disclosed
it
to
lear
both
to
its
executive
personnel,
to
its
technical
personnel
in
grand
rapids
both
in
writing
and
orally.
now,
after
adkins
made
this
disclosure,
lear
at
its
michigan
plant
in
grand
rapids
began
experimenting
also
with
a
self-aligning
principle
which
adkins
had
rejected
and
experimented
with
this
principle
for
roughly
13
months
at
which
time
they
were
intending
to
put
the
self-aligning
principle
into
what
we're
now
calling
the
michigan
steel
gyros.
in
fact,
they
had
set
up
on
production
ready
to
go
with
the
self-aligning
principle
in
it.
and
after
a
limited
production
run,
it
was
determined
that
it
would
not
work
in
production
quantity.
as
a
result
of
which,
the
technical
personnel
at
michigan
held
what
mr.
shepple
who
was
the
head
of
that
section
referred
to
as
a
midnight
meeting
and
decided
to
use
adkins'
invention
in
the
steel
gyros
as
the
only
solution
to
the
problem
at
a
critical
time
period
when
they
had
to
get
it
to
production
with
it.
the
result
was
that
between
1955
and
1963,
lear
amassed
sales
in
excess
of
$67
million
effectively
eliminating
all
competition
in
this
market.
now,
all
that
we're
asking
here
is
that
the
court
recognizes
that
the
california
supreme
court
did
that
the
primary
consideration
for
the
bargain
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
validity
of
the
patent.
it
was
solely
the
right
to
use
this
valuable
invention
and
the
other
additional
considerations
which
i
have
outlined
subject
to
lear's
rights
to
terminate
on
these
conditions
subsequent
which
we're
very
carefully
drawn
to
provide
that
they
would
not
be
as
broad
as
lear
as
now
urging
and
the
california
supreme
court
in
fact
found
they
were
not
as
broad.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
that's
correct.
when
you
view
it
in
entire
context
with
the
first
agreement
in
the
history
of
what
adkins
was
doing
and
what
lear
needed
then
i
think
it
puts
it
in
the
context
that
this
is
his
true
reward
for
disclosing
this
invention
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
and
although
that
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
enormous
value,
exactly.
and
in
drafting
the
55
agreement
as
the
supreme
court
found,
they
were
aware
of
these
considerations.
and
the
supreme
court
in
fact
outlined
all
these
various
considerations
which
they
got
in
reaching
its
conclusion
that
they
were
not
bargaining
for
the
right
to
say
that
the
patent
was
invalid
and
therefore
we
don't
have
to
pay.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
yes,
your
honor.
as
i
said
before,
the
supreme
court
stated
that
he
was
although
the
actual
fact
and
i
put
the
citations
in
the
appendix
was
that
he
was
not
where
as
lear
was
represented
not
only
by
house
counsel
but
also
by
outside
patent
counsel
and
in
fact
conducted
negotiations
with
them
for
three
years
and
did
not
get
serious
in
concluding
this
agreement
until
after
sales
began
to
mount
up
when
they
figured
they
better
hurry
up
and
get
it
done
before
he
went
back
under
the
first
agreement
under
which
their
liability
was
far
more
broader.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
think
it
has
a
relevance
to
the
issue
because
if
you
take
the
state
contractual
construction
ground
then
the
validity
or
invalidity
of
the
patent
is
not
a
defense
in
this
case
because
the
parties
were
not
bargaining
for
a
valid
patent.
they
were
bargaining
for
the
disclosure
and
this
was
adkins'
compensation
for
making
that
disclosure
to
him.
you
must
take
this
case
in
the
context
of
the
history
of
the
case.
this
is
what
makes
it
unique
from
virtually
every
other
patent
situation.
in
the
normal
situation,
it's
the
pressure
of
the
existence
of
an
application
or
a
patent
which
forces
the
bargain.
here,
the
pressure
was
not
the
patent
rights
or
the
patent
laws.
here,
the
pressure
was
the
first
agreement
and
all
the
consideration
that
lear
had
received
under
the
first
agreement
and
additionally
the
consideration
act
and
gave
up
under
the
second
agreement
which
i
have
outlined.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
i
think
in
the
interpretation
of
the
contract
that's
exactly
what
they
meant
that
in
construing
the
contract
it
is
to
be
governed
by
the
laws
of
the
state
of
california.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
lear
had
lawyers,
no
question
about
that.
both
house
counsel
and
outside
patent
counsel
who
advise
them
extensively
in
the
supreme.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
adkins
did
not
in
negotiating
this
agreement
except
at
the
initial
stage
with
respect
to
one
other
segment
of
it
which
is
not
an
issue
which
adkins'
lawyer
drafted
and
then
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
agreement
thereafter
so
that
the
terms
that
we're
concerned
with
were
drafted
exclusively
by
adkins
without
counsel
representing.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
it
is
used
in
a
gyroscope
to
accurately
position
the
bearings
which
support
the
gimbal
in
coaxial
and
parallel
relationship.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
a
basic
thing
is
a
gyroscope
which
is
used
in
the
guidance
of
aircraft.
basically,
the
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
it's
very
widely
used,
yes.
an
airplane
has
to
have
at
least
two
of
them,
one
to
tell
you
direction
and
one
to
tell
altitude
and
the
gyro
is
mounted
very
carefully,
gyro
is
a
rotor
basically
involves
a
rotor
which
is
mounted
in
gimbal
rings
so
that
in
can
move
in
three
degrees
of
freedom.
and
the
accuracy
of
the
alignment
of
the
bearings
that
hold
the
gimbals
determined
the
accuracy
of
the
signal
which
the
gyro
produces
over
a
1
to
5
to
10
ratio
for
example.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
that
was
the
gross
that
lear
received
from
sales
of
products
which
incorporated
adkins'
invention
both
the
2156
gyro
and
the
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
$67
million.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
no
of
the
companies
were
making
it
then
and
no
other
companies
are
making
it
now.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
there
are
the
companies
making
gyros.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
but
as
the
government
states
in
its
brief,
lear
is
the
leading
competitor
in
the
gyro
business
for
one
reason.
they
have
an
exclusive
on
adkins'
invention
which
they're
using
in
their
gyros
which
amassed
the
sales
in
just
a
period
of
1955
to
1963
of
an
excess
of
$67
million.
now,
i
would
like
to
spend
a
few
moments
if
i
might
on
the
question
of
how
the
2156
california
gyro
and
the
michigan
steel
gyros
are
assembled
and
the
result
in
structure
because
i
think
there
may
be
some
confusion
in
the
mind
of
the
court
after
yesterday's
argument.
preliminary,
despite
mr.
wallace's
statement
that
there
are
two
patents
involved
in
this
case,
they
are
not
there
is
only
one
patent
application
and
one
patent.
this
one
patent
application
or
there's
one
patent
contains
claim
number
9
which
covers
both
the
2156
california
gyro
and
the
michigan
steel
gyro
as
i
will
hereinafter
explain.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
they're
the
same
thing,
yes.
they
are
assembled
in
the
same
way.
the
function
is
the
same.
the
result
in
structure
is
the
same.
there
is
no
material
difference
whatsoever
in
these
gyros.
in
both
gyros,
the
assembly
procedures
as
follows:
bearing
cups
are
placed
on
the
ends
of
the
mandrel.
the
cups
are
held
on
the
mandrel
not
by
screws
as
mr.
hale
may
have
implied
but
rather
are
held
on
the
mandrel
by
the
tight
fit
of
the
bearing
cup
with
respect
to
the
mandrel.
then,
the
bearing
cups
are
coated
with
cement
and
the
two
gimbal
halves
are
placed
over
the
mandrel
holding
the
bearing
cups.
each
gimbal
half
has
a
center
hole
and
when
it
is
closed
down
on
this
mandrel
the
bearing
cups
position
themselves
in
the
hole
where
when
the
cement
dries
the
bearing
cups
are
then
left
in
the
relationship
which
they
were
in
on
the
mandrel.
once,
the
cement
dries
it's
taken
apart,
the
mandrel
is
removed
and
the
screws
which
hold
the
gimbal
to
the
mandrel
are
also
removed
and
formed
no
part
of
the
invention.
so,
that
the
result
in
structure
is
a
structure
consisting
of
a
pair
of
three
elements
which
achieves
coaxial
and
parallel
alignment
without
relationship
to
the
parallelism
of
the
end
bells
or
the
coaxial
alignment
of
the
receiving
holes.
that,
i
suppose
is
an
over
simplification
but
that's
the
essence
of
this
invention
and
that
was
used
in
both
the
2156
california
gyro
and
also
in
the
michigan
steel
gyros
in
the
same
way.
in
fact,
as
mr.
shepple
who
i
have
referred
to
before
stated
and
he
was
the
head
of
the
steel
gyro
development
program
the
assembly
finished
structure.
the
result
are
the
same
in
both
gyros
and
the
principle
is
the
same
in
both
gyros.
thus,
the
remaining
question
is
whether
claim
9
which
was
on
a
chart
presented
by
mr.
hale
yesterday.
question
is
whether
that
claim
covers
these
gyros.
lear
concedes
that
it
covers
the
2156
gyros
and
because
there
are
no
material
differences
between
the
2156
california
gyro
and
the
michigan
steel
gyros
it
also
covers
the
michigan
steel
gyros.
this
is
what
the
jury
found
and
this
is
also
what
the
california
supreme
court
held
stating
in
fact
that
the
evidence
was
uncontradicted
that
claim
9
covers
the
michigan
steel
gyros.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
yes.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
yes,
it
is
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
that
is
correct.
that
is
their
contention.
however,
the
california
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
don't
know
if
they're
saying
that
that
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
what
they're
saying
that
as
they
view
the
michigan
steel
gyros.
it
is
not
covered
by
the
claims.
however,
they
do
not
view
the
michigan
steel
gyros
the
same
way
as
the
five
witnesses
who
testified
on
the
subject
including
their
own
witness
has
viewed
it.
all
five
witnesses
testified
that
the
michigan
steel
gyro
is
assembled
and
exactly
the
same
way
as
the
2156
gyro
that
the
alignment
if
achieved
by
the
permissive
cooperation
between
the
bearing
cup
at
both
ends
and
the
receiving
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
yes,
it
did.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
and
it
did
so
after
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
no,
there
was
not.
but
the
issue
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
no,
the
instructions
are
not
challenged
as
far
as
i'm
aware
at
least
on
the
issue
of
infringement
that
they're
challenged.
they
were
challenged
in
some
other
respect
on
various
other
matters
but
not
on
infringement.
and
as
the
california
supreme
court
found
the
evidence
was
uncontradicted
and
compel
the
conclusion
that
the
claim
9
covered
the
michigan
steel
gyros.
and
i've
set
forth
most
of
that
testimony
in
the
appendix,
five
witnesses,
mr.
lee,
shepple,
adkins,
carpenter
and
i
believe
charleston.
if
i
may,
i
will
get
back
for
just
a
moment
to
the
--
this
court's
opinion
in
the
automatic
radio
versus
hazeltine
case
as
i
read
that
opinion
and
assuming
we're
concerned
with
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
in
this
case,
this
court
has
held
that
where
there
is
no
misuse
of
the
patent
such
as
the
court
found
in
sole
in
katzinger
as
price
fixing
and
as
the
court
found
in
mercoid
as
a
tie-in
then
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
maybe
applied
in
and
in
fact
should
be
applied
and
that's
what
was
done
in
that
case.
taking
it
back
to
the
foundation,
i
would
like
to
read
one
quote
from
this
court's
opinion
in
united
states
versus
harvey
steel
and
i
think
it's
particularly
applicable
to
the
bargain
of
these
parties.
there,
this
court
said,
“the
united
states
was
dealing
with
a
matter
upon
which
it
had
all
the
knowledge
that
anyone
had
that
it
was
contracting
for
the
use
of
a
process
which
however
much
it
may
now
be
impugned
the
united
states
would
not
have
used
when
it
did
but
for
the
communications
of
the
claimant
and
that
it
was
contracting
for
the
process
which
it
actually
used
a
process
which
has
revolutionized
the
naval
armor
of
the
world.”
this
language
can
be
read
directly
on
our
case
as
to
what
they
were
in
fact
contracting
for.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
yes,
there
was
a
patent.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
and
the
court
found
that
there
was
both
a
patent
and
a
process
and
that
principally
what
the
government
was
wanting
to
use
was
the
process
or
the
know-how
or
the
disclosure
of
how
to
do
it.
and
they
entered
into
the
contract
which
again
looked
like
a
formal
patent
license
agreement
on
that
basis
and
the
court
said
that
where
what
you
were
after
was
the
disclosure
of
the
idea,
it
should
not
be
a
defense
if
the
patent
is
invalid
because
you
receive
everything
you
bargained
for
it.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
that
was
united
states
versus
harvey
steel.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
yes,
i
think
that
would
dispose
of
this
case
if
the
doctrine
of
estoppel
is
affirmed
as
i
see
that's
the
end
of
this
case.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
that's
correct.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
that's
right
that
it
will
not
be
a
part
of
the
bargain
and
need
not
the
consideration
they're
bargaining
for
one
with
respect
to
the
other
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
no,
there
is
no
express
agreement
but
the
california
supreme
court
in
construing
the
contract
stated
that
that
was
the
construction
that
had
to
be
placed
on
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
think
that's
what
they
were
saying,
yes
that
they
have
narrowly
limited
their
rights
to
terminate
this
agreement
and
that
particular
conditions
subsequent
was
designed
to
apply
only
when
some
third
party
adjudicated
the
patent
to
be
invalid
in
which
case
that
third
party
could
use
it
free
then
lear
could
too
but
that
was
it's
only
escape
hatch
so
to
speak.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
really
can't
answer
that
your
honor
i
just
don't
know
how
frequently
they're
doing,
how
frequently
they
don't.
i
would
assume
if
the
licensee
was
concerned
about
it,
he
would
expressly
reserve
the
right
to
contest
the
validity
and
make
an
express
part
of
the
bargain.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
would
think
the
answer
to
that
is
probably
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
that's
correct.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
yes,
but
that
provision
as
the
california
supreme
court
construed
it
was
drawn
to
permit
lear
which
had
an
exclusive
license
to
terminate
in
the
event
that
some
third
party
adjudicated
it
to
be
invalid
and
therefore
acquired
the
right
to
use
it
free.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
but
to
the
sole
extent
that
lear's
rights
to
terminate
and
avoid
its
bargain
are
tied
to
the
--
what
the
patent
office
would
do
what
some
third
party
might
do,
did
not
give
lear
the
right
to
do
it.
in
other
words,
it
is
tied
in
a
limited
way
to
what
might
happen
under
the
patent
laws
but
only
in
a
very
limited
way.
it
doesn't
form
a
part
of
the
consideration.
it
forms
only
the
conditions
subsequent
under
which
lear
can
get
out
of
the
bargain.
now,
assuming
the
sake
of
argument
only
that
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
has
to
be
overturned
then
the
question
becomes
what
happens
to
this
case
thereafter.
now,
although
lear
urges
that
this
court
then
delve
into
the
issues
of
validity
of
the
patent
and
itself
determine
the
issue,
the
government
concedes
that
in
that
situation
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
california
supreme
court
which
has
not
yet
considered
the
issue
of
validity.
it
is
the
policy
of
this
court
that
lower
courts
first
be
given
the
opportunity
to
pass
on
questions
before
this
court
reviews
them.
otherwise,
in
this
case,
the
result
would
be
since
there
are
no
new
or
noble
patent
issues
involved
but
this
court
would
be
sitting
and
performing
a
function
performed
by
the
court
of
claims
for
instance
that,
the
right
of
ordinary
review
rather
than
reviewing
questions
of
law.
moreover,
even
if
the
patent
was
held
invalid
that
would
not
in
the
case,
that
would
still
be
additional
things
that
have
to
be
considered
such
as
the
proper
cut-off
date
for
the
payment
of
royalties
if
the
patent
is
held
invalid.
and
on
this
issue,
the
government
also
concedes
in
its
amicus
brief
that
the
resolution
of
this
issue
where
the
license
is
exclusive
would
depend
upon
state
considerations
of
fairness
between
the
parties.
similarly,
we
would
have
in
this
case
the
right
to
pursue
the
second
cause
of
action.
the
second
cause
of
action
was
an
alternative
cause
of
action
which
existed
for
the
idea,
discovery
and
invention
as
and
unpatented
and
unpatentable
invention.
and
we
took
the
position
under
that
second
cause
of
action
that
if
the
license
agreement
for
some
reason
failed
either
because
of
a
failure
or
consideration
or
because
of
some
illegality
or
for
some
other
reason
that
adkins
was
under
one
of
these
theories
pleaded
there
entitled
to
recover
the
reasonable
value
of
what
he
in
fact
convey
to
lear
when
he
disclosed
the
idea.
now,
although
it's
been
contended
that
mr.
adkins
waived
the
second
cause
of
action
in
its
entirety
he
did
not
in
fact
do
so
of
the
trial
court
had
held
that
mr.
adkins
have
waived
the
entire
cause
of
action
but
on
the
writ
of
mandate
proceeding,
the
district
court
of
appeal
reversed
and
compelled
the
trial
court
judge
to
enter
an
amendment
to
the
judgment
stating
that
the
second
cause
of
action
had
not
been
waived
for
what
adkins
had
disclosed
to
lear
insofar
as
related
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
patent
application.
i
believe
that
concludes
my
presentation.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
because
i'm
referring
to
exhibit
a
attached
to
the
complaint
which
is
the
same
document
and
which
was
admitted
in
the
answer.
well,
it's
incorrect
to
that
extent.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
oh!
yes,
it's
in
the
record
because
it
attached
the
complaint
and
the
answer
admits
that
the
party
signed
this
agreement.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
no,
it
was
admitted
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
it
was
admitted
for
identification
only.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
yes.
you
can
consider
it
because
it
was
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
--
to
the
complaint
as
an
exhibit
and
the
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
in
california
you
do
not
have
to
offer
something
into
evidence
which
is
admitted
once
it
is
admitted
in
the
answer
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
no,
it
did
not
because
i
was
trying
to
get
to
another
subject
with
it
but
in
the
answer
it
was
admitted
that
lear
had
signed
this
agreement
and
the
california
supreme
court
in
fact
considered
it
in
its
opinion.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
that's
correct.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
it
is
important
to
show
in
this
case
that
lear
never
properly
raised
or
preserved
the
question
of
whether
licensee
estoppel
violates
either
the
patent
laws
or
the
antitrust
laws.
although
mr.
wallace
for
the
government
referred
the
court
to
pages
25
to
28
of
one
of
lear's
reply
briefs
where
lear
had
quoted
the
constitutional
standard
for
invention
and
the
sections
of
the
patent
laws
dealing
with
validity.
he
did
not
read
far
enough
from
that
portion
of
the
brief.
in
that
section
after
quoting
those
provisions
what
lear
was
arguing
was
only
that
the
federal
laws
including
the
constitutional
standard
had
to
be
applied
in
determining
the
question
of
validity.
that
portion
did
not
in
any
way
assert
that
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
was
invalid
and
that
it
violated
either
the
patent
laws
or
the
antitrust
laws.
in
fact,
at
page
75
of
that
same
brief,
lear
had
a
separate
section
dealing
with
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
in
which
lear
conceded
that
the
doctrine
was
applicable
in
this
case
unless
it
fell
within
one
of
two
exceptions.
one
being
termination
and
the
other
being
repudiation.
i
have
xerox
copies
of
the
brief
that
mr.
wallace
referred
to
pages
18
to
26
and
i
have
handed
them
to
the
clerk
this
morning
for
this
court
to
consider
if
it's
so
desires.
now,
i
offer
now
a
copy
to
the
government.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
it's
18
through
28.
in
fact,
the
government
concedes
in
its
amicus
brief
that
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
violates
either
the
patent
laws
or
the
antitrust
laws
was
not
timely
raised
or
preserved
in
this
case.
at
page
8,
the
government
says
as
follows,
“this
court
need
not
be
deterred
from
reaching
this
issue,
licensee
estoppel
by
the
fact
that
petitioner's
contentions
in
the
state
courts
were
directed
primarily
to
attempting
to
carve
out
an
exception
to
the
doctrine
rather
than
to
its
overturn.”
because
of
this
court's
decision
upholding
the
doctrine
at
automatic
radio
co.
versus
hazeltine
it
would
have
been
futile
for
the
petitioner
to
argue
broadly
to
the
state
courts
that
federal
law
bars
the
states
from
applying
the
doctrine
of
patent
licensee
estoppel.
moreover,
lear
has
conceded
in
the
state
court
system
that
the
rule
of
licensee
estoppel
was
applicable
unless
lear
fell
within
one
of
two
state
exceptions.
the
best
statement
of
this
concession
appears
at
page
109
of
lear's
answering
brief
in
the
california
district
court
which
is
quoted
at
page
120
of
the
appendix
before
this
court
and
which
states
as
follows,
“it
is
a
recognized
principle
of
law
that
when
a
license
agreement
provides
a
grant
of
a
right
to
either
manufacture,
use
or
sell
a
product
incorporating
a
patented
invention,
the
licensee
is
estopped
to
contest
the
validity
of
the
license
patent
only
so
long
as
the
licensee
is
operating
under
the
license.”
this
is
not
only
the
modern
rule
as
plaintiff
likes
to
call
it
but
as
also
the
old
rule
as
well.
this
rule
was
set
out
in
the
1939
case
of
the
armstrong
co.
versus
the
shell
company
of
california
which
was
a
california
court
opinion.
lear
then
goes
on
to
say
this
estoppel
as
only
so
long
as
the
licensee
operates
under
the
license
agreement.
this
estoppel
arises
not
because
of
the
expressed
terms
in
the
agreement
but
because
the
licensee
is
using
and
enjoying
the
benefit
and
protection
of
the
right
covered
by
the
agreement
and
should
not
be
permitted
to
reap
the
benefits
of
the
agreement
and
at
the
same
time
contest
the
validity
of
the
patents
to
show
failure
of
consideration
for
the
agreement.

mr.

yes
it
did
rely
on
it
to
assert
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
that's
correct.
it
was
never
raised
in
the
state
system
whatsoever.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
the
passage
in
the
brief
that
was
read
to
you
yesterday
was
dealing
primarily
in
fact
exclusively
with
the
constitutional
standard
and
the
patent
laws
insofar
as
they
concern
the
standard
for
invention.
there
was
nothing
said
there
about
licensee
estoppel
and
particularly
nothing
said
about
whether
it
violates
either
the
antitrust
laws
or
the
patent
laws.
that
section
was
dealing
solely
with
the
validity
question
and
what
the
standard
was
for
determining
the
validity
of
a
patent.
i
think
this
is
clear
from
page
28
where
after
quoting
the
constitutional
provision
and
the
patent
standard
set
forth
in
sections
101,
102,
103
and
subsequent
sections.
they
conclude
that
this
test
must
be
applied
in
determining
validity
but
there's
no
statement
there
concerning
licensee
estoppel
or
whether
those
standards
have
to
be
applied
in
determining
whether
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
violates
either
the
patent
laws
or
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
i'm
saying
they
did
not
raise
with
any
specificity
was
the
question
of
whether
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
per
se
violates
either
policy
of
the
antitrust
laws
of
the
policy
of
the
patent
laws.
this
question
was
never
raised
in
the
trial
court
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
--
or
in
the
appellate
courts.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
not
on
this
issue
because
this
issue
was
never
raised.
it
was
--
i
assume
just
conceded
that
the
doctrine
was
applicable
whether
or
not
it
was
state
law.
but
in
trying
to
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
if
it
was
decided
assuming
it
is
essential
to
the
decision
and
it
is
essential
to
the
decision
only
in
a
very
narrow
respect
but
i
would
assume
that
if
it
hadn't
been
properly
raised
that
would
not
be
properly
before
this
court.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
would
assume
that
the
court
had
decided
it
as
a
question
of
state
law
because
it
was
not
raised
as
a
federal
question
and
in
trying
to
carve
out
exceptions
to
the
doctrine
in
that
lear
had
claimed
that
either
terminated
or
repudiated
the
agreement
lear
stated
that
these
were
state
exceptions
to
the
doctrine.
so
that
i
would
gather
that
it
was
more
or
less
assumed
all
the
way
along
the
line
that
what
was
being
applied
was
a
state
doctrine
since
it
was
never
questioned
under
the
federal
laws
in
any
way.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
it
has
been
a
controversy
before
this
court,
yes
but
it
arose
in
this
case
in
the
context
that
lear
conceded
the
applicability
of
the
rule
and
then
contended
only
that
they
fell
within
two
so-called
state
exceptions
that
they
had
either
terminated
the
agreement
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
they
conceded
that
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
was
applicable
without
saying
any
place
in
the
state
system
whether
it
was
state
or
federal
but
by
the
fact
that
they
tried
to
use
so-called
state
exceptions
to
come
without
the
rule.
they
probably
also
conceded
that
it
was
a
state
doctrine
although
i
admit
that
it
was
never
specified
which
one
it
was.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
that's
right.
what
they
conceded
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
no,
they
did
not
do
that
in
the
pleadings.
they
did
this
in
a
brief
on
appeal
and
also
in
a
brief
in
the
trial
court
in
which
they
conceded
the
applicability
of
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
and
so
that
to
bring
themselves
within
two
exceptions
thereto.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
would
have
to
assume
they
did
because
they
never
questioned
that
it
was
applicable.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
can
refer
you
to
page
120
of
the
appendix.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
appendix
number
1,
yes
and
also
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
volume
1,
yes.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
that's
correct.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
on
page
120,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
i
would
assume
that
under
the
procedural
rules
that
have
been
laid
down
by
this
court
that
unless
the
issue
is
timely
raise
as
a
federal
question,
it
is
too
late
to
raise
it
in
this
court.
now,
it
went
through
the
entire
california
system
without
any
question
to
the
applicability
of
the
doctrine.
there
was
no
federal
question
presented,
rather
there
was
only
an
attempt
to
carve
out
state
exceptions
to
this
rule
on
the
theory
that
lear
had
either
terminated
the
agreement
by
sending
notice
of
termination
or
had
repudiated
the
agreement.
and
on
both
those
issues,
lear
took
the
position
that
that
was
state
law
and
since
they
were
applying
it
to
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
i
would
assume
that
they
also
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
i
think
it
is
because
the
only
federal
questions
that
were
raised
below
were
in
connection
with
the
application
of
the
federal
standards
for
patentability
which
never
really
became
an
issue
in
the
california
supreme
court
because
it
applied
the
doctrine
licensee
estoppel.
so,
unless,
the
court
can
reach
the
issue
of
licensee
estoppel,
it
can't
go
any
further
than
that.
and
if
that's
decided
solely
on
a
state
ground
as
a
matter
of
state
contract
law
then
the
federal
patent
issues
which
were
raised
never
arise
in
this
case.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
yes,
that
is
on
the
party
of
the
issues.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
what
the
other
issues
are?
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
the
other
issue
was
primarily
the
construction
of
the
contract
and
lear's
attempts
to
avoid
the
contract
by
saying
that
it
either
terminated
or
repudiated.
and
thereby
get
itself
into
the
federal
court
system
in
a
pure
suit
for
infringement
and
the
california
supreme
court
devoted
a
good
part
of
its
time
to
determining
whether
or
not
they
had
terminated
the
contract.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
no,
i
don't
think
it
does
because
i
don't
think
it
is
in
the
pure
and
technical
sense,
a
patent
contract.
it
relates
to
patent
events
to
a
certain
extent
but
it
is
more
concerned
with
a
bargain
for
the
disclosure
of
an
invention
in
return
for
the
payment
of
a
royalty
for
the
disclosure
of
that
invention.
that
is
the
real
basis
of
that
bargain
which
i
will
get
to
as
i
get
further
in
to
my
argument.
now,
just
as
the
issue
relating
to
the
question
of
licensee
estoppel
is
not
properly
before
this
court,
in
my
opinion,
similarly
the
issue
of
patent
validity
is
not
before
this
court
for
several
reasons.
first,
if
the
issue
of
licensee
estoppel
is
not
before
this
court,
it
cannot
reach
this
dependent
question.
second,
the
issue
of
validity
was
not
one
of
the
five
questions
presented
in
lear's
petition
for
certiorari.
it
is
also
third,
not
a
necessarily
included
question
under
rule
23
(1)
(c).
fourth,
the
california
supreme
court
did
not
consider
the
issue
of
validity
and
under
settled
procedural
rules
of
this
court
will
not
normally
pass
on
questions
in
the
first
instance
without
the
lower
courts
having
first
undertaking
to
decide
those
issues.
in
fact,
the
government
urges
at
page
26
of
its
amicus
brief
that
if
the
issue
of
validity
must
to
be
reached
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
california
supreme
court
for
consideration
of
this
issue.
consequently,
in
my
view
because
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
was
never
properly
raised
as
a
federal
issue
and
the
doctrine
of
the
validity
of
a
patent
is
consequently
not
before
the
court.
the
result
should
be
that
this
petition
be
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
what
i
think
it
was
doing,
was
using
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
that
it
decided
on
state
grounds
because
it
did
so
in
connection
with
the
construction
of
an
agreement
and
although
it
used
the
words
licensee
estoppel
or
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel.
it
was
really
using
those
words
as
a
shorthand
method
of
summing
up
what
it
had
already
determined
on
the
contract
namely
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
that's
right.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
would
assume
that
walker
cites
probably
state
cases
and
federal
cases
as
well.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
would
assume
he
does
but
in
those
cases
it
may
well
have
been
that
what
the
federal
court
was
doing
was
applying
local
line
at
diversity
case
on
a
contract
action
line.
first,
they
wouldn't
know
that
reading
the
case
but
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
when
you
say
that
federal
law
governed
that
the
doctrine
is
a
federal
doctrine
rather
than
a
state
doctrine
licensee
estoppel.
i've
been
assuming
all
along
that
the
doctrine
is
one
of
state
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
oh!
i
think
federal
limitations
would
have
to
control
the
doctrine.
this
court
has
held
that
but
that
is
only
in
a
misused
situation.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
i
think
what
it
was
doing
was
saying
was
one
interpreting
the
contract
and
then
saying
as
a
shorthand
method
that
what
they're
really
saying
is
licensee
estoppel
really
means
that
lear
has
estopped
to
question
the
bargain
that
it
freely
entered
into
in
that
in
making
the
bargain,
it
did
not
make
conclusive
validity
of
the
patent
one
of
the
considerations
for
the
bargain.
and
therefore,
since
failure
of
--
since
invalidity
of
the
patent,
would
not
cause
a
failure
consideration.
it
should
not
be
a
defense.
in
other
words,
the
party
has
never
bargain
with
respect
to
the
validity
of
the
patent.
and
therefore,
it
should
not
be
a
defense
if
it's
invalid
because
it
could
not
affect
the
bargain
of
the
parties.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
correct.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
whether
they
may
go
too
far
because
of
an
overriding
federal
policy
but
we're
confined
to
the
narrow
situation
and
there's
no
misuse
of
the
patent.
i
think
it
remains
just
a
state
question
until
there
is
some
transgression
of
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
perhaps
that
patent
laws
but
i
don't
really
see
how
patent
laws
come
in
to
play
here
especially
in
the
context
of
this
case
because
the
bargain
was
really
not
for
“patents
or
patent
rights”
the
essence
of
the
bargain
as
i
will
get
to
it
in
a
minute
was
that
lear
received
a
disclosure
from
adkins
of
an
idea,
discovery
and
invention
for
which
they
agreed
to
pay
him
as
long
as
they
continue
to
use
it
subject
to
three
conditions
subsequent.
now,
those
conditions
subsequent
were,
one,
if
no
patent
issue.
two,
if
a
patent
issue
with
claims
which
did
not
cover
the
inventions
they
were
using
in
the
2156
california
gyro
and
the
michigan
steel
gyros.
and
three,
if
the
patent
was
held
invalid
in
third
party
action.
so,
although
they
tie
this
escape
hatches
to
what
might
happen
under
the
patent
laws
they
were
really
just
a
way
of
reducing
lear's
liability
under
the
agreement
to
continue
to
pay
until
the
expiration
of
the
patent.
and
since
none
of
these
conditions
has
occurred,
there
of
course
belong
to
the
party.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
it
did
say
that
in
paragraph
2
(a).
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
no,
no
i'm
not
suggesting
you
ignore
that.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
think
you
first
have
to
read
paragraph
2
(a)
with
paragraph
1
(b)
in
order
to
determine
what
lear
was
in
effect
licensee
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
no,
i'm
not
saying
that
at
all.
i'm
saying
that
when
you
read
paragraph
2
(a)
with
paragraph
1
(b)
what
lear
licensed
was
the
invention
disclosed
or
intended
to
be
disclosed
and
by
use
of
the
words
if
patentable
they
were
bargaining
for
what
the
patent
office
might
do
or
what
some
third
party
might
do
to
the
patent
and
third
party
adjudication.
but
they
were
not
bargaining
that
they
themselves
could
contest
the
validity
of
a
patent
and
thereby
avoid
the
bargain.
in
other
words,
they
were
saying
in
effect
that
if
the
patent
does
an
issue
or
if
the
claims
don't
cover
what
we're
making
or
third
party
holds
it
invalid
and
therefore
it
can
use
it
free
that
we
should
also
be
able
to
use
it
free.
and
under
those
conditions
only
we
can
terminate
but
the
validity
between
us
is
decided
by
what
the
patent
office
will
do
in
the
first
instance
in
issuing
or
not
issuing
a
patent.
i
think
that
was
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
no,
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
we're
not
for
this
reason
in
my
view
and
that
is
when
they
tied
their
bargain
to
patentability.
they
were
tying
it
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
--
to
that
standard
for
--
but
only
for
one
purpose
not
to
control
the
rights
vis-a-vis
adkins
and
lear
but
to
likely
or
out
of
the
contract
in
the
event
that
a
patent
didn't
issue
and
somebody
else
could
therefore
use
it.
in
other
words,
their
bargain
was,
we
will
pay
you
for
this
invention
which
we
have
an
inclusive
right
to
use
subject
to
conditions
subsequent
which
are
if
no
patent
issues
or
if
the
claims
are
not
substantial
and
don't
cover
the
inventions
we're
making
--
the
devices
we're
making
or
if
it's
held
invalid
in
third
party
adjudication.
but
only
subject
to
those
three
conditions
can
we
get
out.
other
than
that,
our
bargain
is
founded
upon
your
disclosure
mr.
adkins
of
the
invention
and
our
use
of
the
invention
for
which
we
agreed
to
pay
the
royalty.
so
that
the
patent
laws
are
really
not
involved
in
this
bargain
except
to
the
extent
that
lear's
escape
hatches
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i'm
sure
that's
true,
they
cannot
tie
something
else
to
the
patent
or
broaden
their
rights
on
the
patent
where
they
are
dealing
per
se
with
a
patent
right.
but
the
party
is
here,
we're
not
concerned
in
the
initial
basis
of
the
bargain
with
the
patent
laws.
the
basis
of
the
bargain
was
the
right
to
use
the
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
would
think
in
the
first
instance
it
would
be
a
question
of
state
law
for
the
california
supreme
court
to
construe
what
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
insofar
as
it
relates
to
what
the
consideration
for
the
contract
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
think
i
have
outlined
the
cases
in
my
brief
the
one
that
comes
to
mind
in
particular
is
this
court's
opinion
in
the
case
of
brulotte
versus
thys
where
the
court
was
considering
the
use
of
a
patent
to
exact
a
royalty
after
the
expiration
of
the
patent
by
tying
it
to
the
license
of
the
patent
and
where
the
court
when
faced
with
the
question
of
what
would
happen
if
the
parties
have
made
a
contract
for
a
machine
which
was
not
patented
whether
or
not
this
would
involved
federal
law.
and
the
court
there
said,
“the
sale
or
a
lease
of
unpatented
machines
on
long-term
payments
based
on
a
deferred
purchase
price
or
on
use
would
present
wholly
different
considerations.”
those
arrangements
seldom
rise
to
the
level
of
a
federal
question.
so
i
assume
that
what
the
court
is
saying
where
the
parties
are
contracting
with
respect
to
something
which
is
an
unpatented
invention.
they
are
free
to
make
any
bargain
they
care
to
make
about
it
as
long
as
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
yes
but
as
i'm
trying
to
say
when
they
used
the
word
“patented
or
patentable”
on
paragraph
2
(a),
2
(a)
expressly
refers
to
1
(b)
for
further
definitions
of
the
term
used
and
it
defines
claims
as
including
the
invention
disclosed
or
intended
to
be
disclosed
in
specification
of
the
application
and
that
lear
is
taking
a
license
of
the
invention
which
adkins
disclosed
or
intended
to
disclose
not
with
the
claims
under
the
patent.
so
that
he
merely
used
the
specifications
to
define
the
invention
rather
than
to
take
a
license
of
claims
under
an
application.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
perhaps
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
no,
i'm
not
really
saying
quite
that.
i'm
saying
that
as
interpreted
by
the
california
supreme
court
the
basis
of
the
bargain
between
adkins
and
lear
was
not
a
federal
patent
right.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
don't
believe
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
no,
i
don't
think
that's
my
theory
perhaps
i'm
not
stating
as
i
should
be
stating
but
what
i'm
trying
to
get
across
is
that
the
basis
of
the
bargain
between
adkins
and
the
lear
was
not
the
grant
by
adkins
to
lear
of
a
federal
patent
right.
it
was
rather
indeed
disclosure
by
adkins
of
an
invention
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
that
it's
a
probably
unique
contract.
i
doubt
if
there
will
even
be
another
one
like
it
because
of
the
way
the
contract
arose.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
oh!
yes
including
disclosed
or
intended
to
be
disclosed.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
that's
right.
it
did
anti
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
yes,
i
don't
deny
related
to
the
federal
patent
but
the
question
is
the
way
it
related
to
that
federal
patent.
as
the
california
supreme
court
held,
lear
was
not
concerned
prior
to
the
issuance
of
the
patent
with
particular
claims
in
the
application,
what
they
were
licensing
was
the
invention
either
disclosed
or
intended
to
be
disclosed
in
the
specifications
without
regard
to
the
claims
for
which
they
agreed
to
pay
until
final
patent
office
action.
and
that
further
when
final
patent
office
action
occurred
if
a
patent
issue
they
would
have
to
continue
to
pay
regardless
or
whether
that
patent
was
valid
or
not
valid
because
that
was
no
part
of
the
bargain
between
the
parties
but
however
if
the
patent
did
not
issue
then
they
would
have
the
right
to
seize
paying
further
royalties
because
in
that
situation
then
a
third
party
would
be
free
to
use
the
invention
also.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
you
mean
could
lear
have
used
it
together
with
something
else?
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
in
that
situation,
i
would
assume
that
since
adkins
had
no
control
over
what
lear
used
it
for
that
it
would
no
rise
to
the
level
of
a
federal
question.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
no,
no
i
think
i'm
saying
just
the
opposite.
adkins
could
not
and
did
not
tie
this
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
because
then
if
you
tie
something
in
whether
the
contract
involves
a
patent
or
not
i
would
assume
you
get
involved
with
the
antitrust
laws.
for
example,
you
can
have
conspiracies
to
violate
the
antitrust
laws
that
don't
involved
patents.
similarly,
i
would
assume
you
can
have
agreements
which
violate
the
antitrust
laws
irrespective
other
patents
involved.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
you
mean
where
they
had
agreed
in
the
first
instance
that
if
a
patent
issue
or
did
not
issue
they
would
renegotiate
it?
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
yes.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
no,
i
didn't
say
it
having
nothing
to,
i
said,
it
was
tied
to
it
to
allow
certain
escape
hatches
to
lear
to
get
out
of
the
bargain
if
certain
events
occurred.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
in
my
view,
that's
all
and
in
the
view
of
the
california
supreme
court
if
i
interpret
their
opinion
correctly
that's
all
they
were
involved
with.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
the
patent
was
not
incidental,
it
was
involved
to
the
extent
that
lear's
escape
clauses
are
conditions
subsequent
were
tied
to
what
might
happen
in
the
patent
office
or
in
some
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
third
party
adjudication.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
that's
correct.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i'm
trying
to
tell
you
in
my
view
how
far
i
think
it
is
involved
and
i
think
it
is
involved
only
to
the
extent
that
the
condition
subsequent
under
which
lear
can
avoid
the
payment
of
further
royalties
are
tied
to
the
patent
laws.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
and
no
more.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
i
don't
see
how
they
could
be
following
federal
law
in
this
area.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
really
don't
know
what
they
would've
come
up
with
had
the
question
been
presented
as
one
of
federal
law.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
i
they
recognized
licensee
estoppel,
the
automatic
radio
versus
hazeltine
case
is
probably
the
best
example
of
it.
that's
the
most
recent
decision
in
which
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
per
se
was
upheld
in
1950
after
first
finding
that
there
was
no
patent
misuse.
the
cases
go
all
the
way
back
to
kinsman
versus
parkhurst
in
1855.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
that's
what
i'm
not
so
sure
because
i'm
not
so
sure
that
in
the
cases
that
we've
been
talking
about
the
hazeltine
and
the
kinsman
and
all
the
other
cases
that
they
weren't
applying
that
this
court
wasn't
saying
that
this
state
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
there's
nothing
wrong
with
it
as
long
as
you
don't
use
it
to
transgress
the
antitrust
laws
in
some
way.
i
think
that's
what
they're
after
and
i
think
that's
what
the
hazeltine
opinion
makes
clear
that
assuming
that
a
patent
right
is
involved,
as
long
as
that
patent
right
is
not
misused
either
by
price
fixing
or
tie-ins
or
conspiracies
to
restrain
trade.
then,
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
can
be
applied
and
in
fact
should
be
applied.
i
would
assume
it
is
being
applied
to
enforce
the
bargain
of
the
parties.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
think
that
would
probably
interfere
with
their
right
to
contract
freely
with
each
other
because
the
parties
of
course
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
no,
i
don't
think
it
would.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
because
the
parties
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
because
the
parties
here
at
the
outset
when
they
made
this
bargain
in
1955
were
free
to
contract
as
they
wished.
they
could've
provide
it
in
the
contract
that
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
i
thought
that
in
the
hypothetical
you
post,
you
were
saying
that
the
laws
that
they
could
not
contest
validity.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
that
forecloses
the
parties
from
bargaining
as
to
whether
they
deem
the
validity
of
the
patent
to
be
material
or
not.
so,
for
that
reason,
i
would
say
that
law
is
probably
invalid.
however,
in
this
case
in
1955,
lear
could
very
easily
had
it
been
concerned
with
the
question
of
validity
inserted
a
clause
in
the
agreement
saying,
we
reserve
the
right
to
contest
the
validity
of
this
patent
if
it
issues
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
--
and
if
it's
invalid
we
don't
have
to
pay.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
don't
think
the
federal
law
gives
in
that
right.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
no,
no
and
i
don't
think
it
gives
them
that
right
because
what
the
parties
we're
dealing
with
here
was
not
the
patent
laws
and
the
patent
rights
per
se.
they
were
dealing
with
the
disclosure
of
an
invention
for
which
lear
agreed
to
pay.
at
the
time
it
was
disclosed
it
was
secret,
they
didn't
know
about
it.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
because
i
understand
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
think
he
can
contract
to
purchase
a
bear
idea
or
a
discovery
regardless
of
whether
it's
patented
or
patentable.
this
is
a
question
of
state
contract
law
and
what's
consideration
for
a
contract.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
that
maybe
where
this
court
is
trying
to
go
to
say
that
you
must
engraft
upon
every
agreement
which
deals
with
something
which
is
capable
of
being
patented
a
provision
that
the
parties
cannot
make
a
bargain
unless
they
condition
it
first
on
obtaining
a
patent
and
second
condition
that
upon
the
patent
being
valid.
now,
that
maybe
where
the
court
wants
to
go
but
i
would
submit
that
that's
a
very
harsh
result
to
take
away
from
the
parties
the
free
right
to
make
any
contract
they
wish
with
the
respect
to
an
idea
or
a
discovery
even
if
it
doesn't
arise
to
the
dignity
of
something
that
is
patentable
under
the
federal
patent
laws.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
the
fall
back
on
the
patent
for
one
reason
and
that
is
to
show
that
lear
did
not
come
within
the
conditions
subsequent
it
said
if
a
patent
did
not
issue,
they
didn't
have
to
pay
for
the
royalties.
that's
the
only
extent
to
which
we
rely
on
the
patent
in
this
case
other
than
the
fact
that
the
claims
cover
the
2156
california
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
i
think
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
--
in
this
case
i
think
that
even
if
you
overturn
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
and
held
the
patent
to
be
invalid
that
that
would
not
end
adkins'
rights
under
this
contract
because
it
is
interpreted
by
the
california
supreme
court
the
parties
themselves
were
not
concerned
with
the
validity
or
invalidity
of
the
patent
and
therefore
since
they
did
not
make
this
a
part
of
their
bargain.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
it
appears
at
page
182
of
appendix
1
in
footnote
17.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
yes,
your
honor.
and
reading
from
footnote
17,
california
supreme
court
states,
“lear
states
that
the
license
extended
only
to
validly
patented
claims,
however,
the
provisions
of
the
agreement
setting
forth
the
scope
of
the
license
do
not
so
state.”
the
validity
of
the
patent
was
adverted
to
in
the
agreement
only
in
connection
with
the
right
to
terminate
if
the
patent
“was
subsequently
held
invalid.”
and
the
court
goes
on
to
say
that
page
209
of
that
appendix
the
cause
is
based
on
rights
emanating
from
a
written
agreement
and
the
patent
itself
is
referred
to
only
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
lear
used
the
invention
therein
set
forth.
i
think
that
makes
a
pretty
clear
that
what
the
california
court
was
saying
that
even
if
the
patent
was
invalid
it
would
not
cut
off
lear's
right
or
lear's
obligation
to
pay
royalties
in
this
case
because
they
weren't
bargaining
between
themselves
adkins
and
lear
for
a
conclusively
valid
patent.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
that
it's
only
couch
in
terms
of
the
normal
formal
patent
license
agreement.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
but
i
think
you
can
distinguish
it
in
this
way,
taking
the
typical
situation
first
a
holder
of
either
an
application
for
a
patent
or
a
patent
would
go
to
a
manufacturer
and
say,
the
manufacturer
was
either
using
or
intending
to
use
what
he
thinks
is
covered
by
the
application
of
the
patent.
let's
say
you
either
pay
me
a
royalty
or
i
will
sue
you
for
infringement
of
this
patent.
and
in
that
situation
which
is
the
typical
situation
the
force
behind
the
bargain
is
the
threat
of
the
supposed
patent
right
and
that
is
probably
the
main
force
in
causing
the
bargain
to
be
made
assuming
or
leaving
to
the
one
aside
the
desirability
the
parties
to
settle
but
still
the
main
force
is
the
same.
it's
the
existence
or
the
expected
existence
are
the
patent
right
under
the
federal
law.
this
case
did
not
arise
that
way.
it
arose
rather
with
an
agreement
dated
december
29,
1951
between
adkins
and
lear
which
is
one
page
in
length
as
copied
verbatim
at
page
11
of
the
appendix
in
which
adkins
agreed
to
disclose
the
lear
“all
ideas
inventions
and
discoveries
which
he
might
conceive
of
which
lear
agreed
expressly
would
be
adkins
property
and
adkins
then
agreed
to
license
it
to
lear
for
a
mutually
satisfactory
royalty.”
this
agreement
made
no
mention
of
patents,
patent
rights
or
patentability
to
the
contrary.
the
existence
of
a
patent
or
patent
right
under
this
agreement
was
totally
irrelevant
then
pursuant
to
that
agreement
adkins
went
to
work
for
lear
and
did
invent
something
which
they
wanted
and
when
it
look
to
lear
like
it
was
going
to
be
commercially
successful
they
said
to
themselves,
well,
we
have
to
do
something
about
this
first
agreement
because
under
state
law
he
will
collect
that
reasonable
royalty.
so
the
result
was
that
they
begin
negotiation
with
them
that
went
over
a
three-year
period
and
resulted
in
this
license
agreement.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
i
don't
think
it
is
yet.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
that's
right.
he
was
not
represented
by
counsel.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
the
california
supreme
court
of
course
said
that
he
was
represented
by
counsel.
however,
as
i
stated
in
the
brief
he
was
not
in
fact
represented
by
counsel.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
right,
now
actually
what
happened
there
was
at
the
time
adkins
joined
lear
he
did
have
one
issue
of
patent
and
he
started
negotiations
with
the
lawyer
with
lear
with
respect
to
that
issue
of
patent
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
thereafter,
adkins
and
lear
started
discussing
this
license
agreement
which
adkins
alone
negotiated
with
lear
and
in
the
course
of
so
doing
they
merged
that
other
agreement
with
this
one.
so
that
there
were
several
parts
of
the
same
agreement,
so
he
was
initially
represented
on
another
face
of
it
nothing
to
do
with
this
particular
invention.
i
think
it's
also
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
it
comes
down
to
that
yes
together
with
additional
considerations
which
i
think
make
it
clear
under
the
terms.
i'm
not
on
the
1951
agreement,
but
the
1955
agreement
exactly
what
lear
received.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
basically,
an
analysis
of
all
the
considerations
that
lear
was
bargaining
for
and
that
adkins
was
giving
up
with
reference
to
the
first
agreement.
not
of
which
considerations
had
anything
to
do
with
either
the
power
of
force
behind
the
patent
or
patent
application
or
a
patent
or
a
patent
right
except
to
the
extent
that
conditions
subsequent
where
title
lear's
obligation
to
pay
royalties.
that's
the
only
extent
that
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
would
suggest
that
this
is
not
the
typical
case
and
probably
would
never
come
up
again
for
one
practical
reason
that
most
if
not
all
corporations
when
they
employ
an
inventor
make
him
sign
an
agreement
in
advance
of
his
coming
to
work
that
whatever
he
invents
will
belong
to
the
company.
this
is
the
atypical
situation
because
they
signed
an
agreement
exactly
to
the
contrary.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
perhaps
it's
not
but
it's
also
the
key
to
understanding
the
consideration
which
flowed
from
adkins
to
lear
and
vise
versa
under
the
55
agreement
which
concededly
was
couched
in
terms
of
a
formal
patent
license
agreement.
and
if
i
may
just
dwell
on
that
for
another
moment,
i'd
like
to
analyze
if
i
could
exactly
what
the
considerations
are
that
lear
received
under
this
1955
agreement.
first,
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
sorry?
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
the
55,
yes
sir.
first,
lear
received
the
exclusive
uncontested
and
immediate
right
to
use
the
secret
idea
discovering
invention
which
adkins
had
disclosed
until
final
patent
office
action.
note,
that
i
say
exclusive
and
not
nonexclusive
because
the
license
agreement
was
in
fact
expressly
exclusive
contrary
to
what
the
solicitor
general
states
in
his
brief,
it
started
out
as
an
exclusive
license
not
a
nonexclusive
license.
second,
lear
received
the
cancellation
of
the
letter
agreement
that
december
29,
1951
under
which
his
liability
to
adkins
was
far
broader
than
under
the
agreement
that
replaced
it.
under
that
agreement
pursuant
to
california
law,
particularly
a
case
known
as
desny
versus
wilder
which
is
california
supreme
court
case
cited
in
my
brief.
based
on
that
agreement,
the
court
would
find
that
there
was
an
implied
contract
between
the
parties
for
lear
to
take
the
mutually
satisfactory
royalty
which
it
would
have
determined
was
a
reasonable
royalty
and
under
that
agreement,
lear
would
be
bound
to
pay
as
long
as
lear
use
the
device
without
any
escape
hatches
or
condition
subsequent
termination
clauses
whatsoever.
and
that
brings
to
the
third
point.
third
thing
that
lear
got
under
this
agreement
was
the
right
to
seize
payment
of
“for
the
royalties”
if
no
patent
issued
or
if
it
issue
which
claims
which
did
not
cover
the
gyros
in
issue
or
some
third
party
held
it
invalid.
and
fourth
and
equally
important,
there
were
two
additional
agreements
signed
concurrently
with
this
license
agreement
which
are
attached
to
lear's
answer
and
are
on
appendix
a
at
pages
40
to
45
wherein
lear
in
addition
to
receiving
the
right
to
use
the
invention
disclosed
in
the
patent
application
also
received
a
release
from
adkins
of
all
other
and
different
ideas,
discoveries
and
invention
which
he
may
have
created
for
the
year
past,
present
and
future
as
long
as
he
work
for
the
year.
so
that
this
was
the
consideration
that
lear
was
concerned
for
and
was
bargaining
for
as
the
california
supreme
court
recognized
it
was
not
bargaining
in
addition
for
a
conclusively
valid
patent
under
which
it
could
say
that
the
patent
was
invalid
and
therefore
we
don't
have
to
pay.
its
sole
rights
were
under
the
very
carefully
drawn
condition
subsequent.
i
think
it's
also
important
in
this
case
to
understand
that
when
adkins
went
to
work
for
lear
in
january
of
1952
after
signing
this
first
letter
agreement,
he
went
to
work
for
what
the
president
of
lear
incorporated
described
his
“coffee
and
cake
money”
which
was
$650.00
a
month.
thus,
adkins
real
reward
under
this
initial
bargain
was
to
be
dependent
upon
his
successors
and
inventor
and
after
spending
approximately
six
months
experimenting
with
a
bearing
on
as
a
self-aligning
type
bearing
he
concluded
that
that
approach
to
the
problem
would
not
work
after
which
he
conceived
of
the
invention
which
is
the
subject
matter
of
this
case
and
fully
disclosed
it
to
lear
both
to
its
executive
personnel,
to
its
technical
personnel
in
grand
rapids
both
in
writing
and
orally.
now,
after
adkins
made
this
disclosure,
lear
at
its
michigan
plant
in
grand
rapids
began
experimenting
also
with
a
self-aligning
principle
which
adkins
had
rejected
and
experimented
with
this
principle
for
roughly
13
months
at
which
time
they
were
intending
to
put
the
self-aligning
principle
into
what
we're
now
calling
the
michigan
steel
gyros.
in
fact,
they
had
set
up
on
production
ready
to
go
with
the
self-aligning
principle
in
it.
and
after
a
limited
production
run,
it
was
determined
that
it
would
not
work
in
production
quantity.
as
a
result
of
which,
the
technical
personnel
at
michigan
held
what
mr.
shepple
who
was
the
head
of
that
section
referred
to
as
a
midnight
meeting
and
decided
to
use
adkins'
invention
in
the
steel
gyros
as
the
only
solution
to
the
problem
at
a
critical
time
period
when
they
had
to
get
it
to
production
with
it.
the
result
was
that
between
1955
and
1963,
lear
amassed
sales
in
excess
of
$67
million
effectively
eliminating
all
competition
in
this
market.
now,
all
that
we're
asking
here
is
that
the
court
recognizes
that
the
california
supreme
court
did
that
the
primary
consideration
for
the
bargain
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
validity
of
the
patent.
it
was
solely
the
right
to
use
this
valuable
invention
and
the
other
additional
considerations
which
i
have
outlined
subject
to
lear's
rights
to
terminate
on
these
conditions
subsequent
which
we're
very
carefully
drawn
to
provide
that
they
would
not
be
as
broad
as
lear
as
now
urging
and
the
california
supreme
court
in
fact
found
they
were
not
as
broad.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
that's
correct.
when
you
view
it
in
entire
context
with
the
first
agreement
in
the
history
of
what
adkins
was
doing
and
what
lear
needed
then
i
think
it
puts
it
in
the
context
that
this
is
his
true
reward
for
disclosing
this
invention
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
and
although
that
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
enormous
value,
exactly.
and
in
drafting
the
55
agreement
as
the
supreme
court
found,
they
were
aware
of
these
considerations.
and
the
supreme
court
in
fact
outlined
all
these
various
considerations
which
they
got
in
reaching
its
conclusion
that
they
were
not
bargaining
for
the
right
to
say
that
the
patent
was
invalid
and
therefore
we
don't
have
to
pay.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
yes,
your
honor.
as
i
said
before,
the
supreme
court
stated
that
he
was
although
the
actual
fact
and
i
put
the
citations
in
the
appendix
was
that
he
was
not
where
as
lear
was
represented
not
only
by
house
counsel
but
also
by
outside
patent
counsel
and
in
fact
conducted
negotiations
with
them
for
three
years
and
did
not
get
serious
in
concluding
this
agreement
until
after
sales
began
to
mount
up
when
they
figured
they
better
hurry
up
and
get
it
done
before
he
went
back
under
the
first
agreement
under
which
their
liability
was
far
more
broader.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
think
it
has
a
relevance
to
the
issue
because
if
you
take
the
state
contractual
construction
ground
then
the
validity
or
invalidity
of
the
patent
is
not
a
defense
in
this
case
because
the
parties
were
not
bargaining
for
a
valid
patent.
they
were
bargaining
for
the
disclosure
and
this
was
adkins'
compensation
for
making
that
disclosure
to
him.
you
must
take
this
case
in
the
context
of
the
history
of
the
case.
this
is
what
makes
it
unique
from
virtually
every
other
patent
situation.
in
the
normal
situation,
it's
the
pressure
of
the
existence
of
an
application
or
a
patent
which
forces
the
bargain.
here,
the
pressure
was
not
the
patent
rights
or
the
patent
laws.
here,
the
pressure
was
the
first
agreement
and
all
the
consideration
that
lear
had
received
under
the
first
agreement
and
additionally
the
consideration
act
and
gave
up
under
the
second
agreement
which
i
have
outlined.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
i
think
in
the
interpretation
of
the
contract
that's
exactly
what
they
meant
that
in
construing
the
contract
it
is
to
be
governed
by
the
laws
of
the
state
of
california.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
lear
had
lawyers,
no
question
about
that.
both
house
counsel
and
outside
patent
counsel
who
advise
them
extensively
in
the
supreme.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
adkins
did
not
in
negotiating
this
agreement
except
at
the
initial
stage
with
respect
to
one
other
segment
of
it
which
is
not
an
issue
which
adkins'
lawyer
drafted
and
then
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
agreement
thereafter
so
that
the
terms
that
we're
concerned
with
were
drafted
exclusively
by
adkins
without
counsel
representing.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
it
is
used
in
a
gyroscope
to
accurately
position
the
bearings
which
support
the
gimbal
in
coaxial
and
parallel
relationship.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
a
basic
thing
is
a
gyroscope
which
is
used
in
the
guidance
of
aircraft.
basically,
the
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
it's
very
widely
used,
yes.
an
airplane
has
to
have
at
least
two
of
them,
one
to
tell
you
direction
and
one
to
tell
altitude
and
the
gyro
is
mounted
very
carefully,
gyro
is
a
rotor
basically
involves
a
rotor
which
is
mounted
in
gimbal
rings
so
that
in
can
move
in
three
degrees
of
freedom.
and
the
accuracy
of
the
alignment
of
the
bearings
that
hold
the
gimbals
determined
the
accuracy
of
the
signal
which
the
gyro
produces
over
a
1
to
5
to
10
ratio
for
example.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
that
was
the
gross
that
lear
received
from
sales
of
products
which
incorporated
adkins'
invention
both
the
2156
gyro
and
the
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
$67
million.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
no
of
the
companies
were
making
it
then
and
no
other
companies
are
making
it
now.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
there
are
the
companies
making
gyros.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
but
as
the
government
states
in
its
brief,
lear
is
the
leading
competitor
in
the
gyro
business
for
one
reason.
they
have
an
exclusive
on
adkins'
invention
which
they're
using
in
their
gyros
which
amassed
the
sales
in
just
a
period
of
1955
to
1963
of
an
excess
of
$67
million.
now,
i
would
like
to
spend
a
few
moments
if
i
might
on
the
question
of
how
the
2156
california
gyro
and
the
michigan
steel
gyros
are
assembled
and
the
result
in
structure
because
i
think
there
may
be
some
confusion
in
the
mind
of
the
court
after
yesterday's
argument.
preliminary,
despite
mr.
wallace's
statement
that
there
are
two
patents
involved
in
this
case,
they
are
not
there
is
only
one
patent
application
and
one
patent.
this
one
patent
application
or
there's
one
patent
contains
claim
number
9
which
covers
both
the
2156
california
gyro
and
the
michigan
steel
gyro
as
i
will
hereinafter
explain.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
they're
the
same
thing,
yes.
they
are
assembled
in
the
same
way.
the
function
is
the
same.
the
result
in
structure
is
the
same.
there
is
no
material
difference
whatsoever
in
these
gyros.
in
both
gyros,
the
assembly
procedures
as
follows:
bearing
cups
are
placed
on
the
ends
of
the
mandrel.
the
cups
are
held
on
the
mandrel
not
by
screws
as
mr.
hale
may
have
implied
but
rather
are
held
on
the
mandrel
by
the
tight
fit
of
the
bearing
cup
with
respect
to
the
mandrel.
then,
the
bearing
cups
are
coated
with
cement
and
the
two
gimbal
halves
are
placed
over
the
mandrel
holding
the
bearing
cups.
each
gimbal
half
has
a
center
hole
and
when
it
is
closed
down
on
this
mandrel
the
bearing
cups
position
themselves
in
the
hole
where
when
the
cement
dries
the
bearing
cups
are
then
left
in
the
relationship
which
they
were
in
on
the
mandrel.
once,
the
cement
dries
it's
taken
apart,
the
mandrel
is
removed
and
the
screws
which
hold
the
gimbal
to
the
mandrel
are
also
removed
and
formed
no
part
of
the
invention.
so,
that
the
result
in
structure
is
a
structure
consisting
of
a
pair
of
three
elements
which
achieves
coaxial
and
parallel
alignment
without
relationship
to
the
parallelism
of
the
end
bells
or
the
coaxial
alignment
of
the
receiving
holes.
that,
i
suppose
is
an
over
simplification
but
that's
the
essence
of
this
invention
and
that
was
used
in
both
the
2156
california
gyro
and
also
in
the
michigan
steel
gyros
in
the
same
way.
in
fact,
as
mr.
shepple
who
i
have
referred
to
before
stated
and
he
was
the
head
of
the
steel
gyro
development
program
the
assembly
finished
structure.
the
result
are
the
same
in
both
gyros
and
the
principle
is
the
same
in
both
gyros.
thus,
the
remaining
question
is
whether
claim
9
which
was
on
a
chart
presented
by
mr.
hale
yesterday.
question
is
whether
that
claim
covers
these
gyros.
lear
concedes
that
it
covers
the
2156
gyros
and
because
there
are
no
material
differences
between
the
2156
california
gyro
and
the
michigan
steel
gyros
it
also
covers
the
michigan
steel
gyros.
this
is
what
the
jury
found
and
this
is
also
what
the
california
supreme
court
held
stating
in
fact
that
the
evidence
was
uncontradicted
that
claim
9
covers
the
michigan
steel
gyros.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
yes.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
yes,
it
is
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
that
is
correct.
that
is
their
contention.
however,
the
california
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
don't
know
if
they're
saying
that
that
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
what
they're
saying
that
as
they
view
the
michigan
steel
gyros.
it
is
not
covered
by
the
claims.
however,
they
do
not
view
the
michigan
steel
gyros
the
same
way
as
the
five
witnesses
who
testified
on
the
subject
including
their
own
witness
has
viewed
it.
all
five
witnesses
testified
that
the
michigan
steel
gyro
is
assembled
and
exactly
the
same
way
as
the
2156
gyro
that
the
alignment
if
achieved
by
the
permissive
cooperation
between
the
bearing
cup
at
both
ends
and
the
receiving
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
yes,
it
did.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
and
it
did
so
after
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
no,
there
was
not.
but
the
issue
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
no,
the
instructions
are
not
challenged
as
far
as
i'm
aware
at
least
on
the
issue
of
infringement
that
they're
challenged.
they
were
challenged
in
some
other
respect
on
various
other
matters
but
not
on
infringement.
and
as
the
california
supreme
court
found
the
evidence
was
uncontradicted
and
compel
the
conclusion
that
the
claim
9
covered
the
michigan
steel
gyros.
and
i've
set
forth
most
of
that
testimony
in
the
appendix,
five
witnesses,
mr.
lee,
shepple,
adkins,
carpenter
and
i
believe
charleston.
if
i
may,
i
will
get
back
for
just
a
moment
to
the
--
this
court's
opinion
in
the
automatic
radio
versus
hazeltine
case
as
i
read
that
opinion
and
assuming
we're
concerned
with
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
in
this
case,
this
court
has
held
that
where
there
is
no
misuse
of
the
patent
such
as
the
court
found
in
sole
in
katzinger
as
price
fixing
and
as
the
court
found
in
mercoid
as
a
tie-in
then
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
maybe
applied
in
and
in
fact
should
be
applied
and
that's
what
was
done
in
that
case.
taking
it
back
to
the
foundation,
i
would
like
to
read
one
quote
from
this
court's
opinion
in
united
states
versus
harvey
steel
and
i
think
it's
particularly
applicable
to
the
bargain
of
these
parties.
there,
this
court
said,
“the
united
states
was
dealing
with
a
matter
upon
which
it
had
all
the
knowledge
that
anyone
had
that
it
was
contracting
for
the
use
of
a
process
which
however
much
it
may
now
be
impugned
the
united
states
would
not
have
used
when
it
did
but
for
the
communications
of
the
claimant
and
that
it
was
contracting
for
the
process
which
it
actually
used
a
process
which
has
revolutionized
the
naval
armor
of
the
world.”
this
language
can
be
read
directly
on
our
case
as
to
what
they
were
in
fact
contracting
for.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
yes,
there
was
a
patent.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
and
the
court
found
that
there
was
both
a
patent
and
a
process
and
that
principally
what
the
government
was
wanting
to
use
was
the
process
or
the
know-how
or
the
disclosure
of
how
to
do
it.
and
they
entered
into
the
contract
which
again
looked
like
a
formal
patent
license
agreement
on
that
basis
and
the
court
said
that
where
what
you
were
after
was
the
disclosure
of
the
idea,
it
should
not
be
a
defense
if
the
patent
is
invalid
because
you
receive
everything
you
bargained
for
it.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
that
was
united
states
versus
harvey
steel.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
yes,
i
think
that
would
dispose
of
this
case
if
the
doctrine
of
estoppel
is
affirmed
as
i
see
that's
the
end
of
this
case.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
that's
correct.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
that's
right
that
it
will
not
be
a
part
of
the
bargain
and
need
not
the
consideration
they're
bargaining
for
one
with
respect
to
the
other
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
no,
there
is
no
express
agreement
but
the
california
supreme
court
in
construing
the
contract
stated
that
that
was
the
construction
that
had
to
be
placed
on
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
think
that's
what
they
were
saying,
yes
that
they
have
narrowly
limited
their
rights
to
terminate
this
agreement
and
that
particular
conditions
subsequent
was
designed
to
apply
only
when
some
third
party
adjudicated
the
patent
to
be
invalid
in
which
case
that
third
party
could
use
it
free
then
lear
could
too
but
that
was
it's
only
escape
hatch
so
to
speak.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
really
can't
answer
that
your
honor
i
just
don't
know
how
frequently
they're
doing,
how
frequently
they
don't.
i
would
assume
if
the
licensee
was
concerned
about
it,
he
would
expressly
reserve
the
right
to
contest
the
validity
and
make
an
express
part
of
the
bargain.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
i
would
think
the
answer
to
that
is
probably
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
that's
correct.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
yes,
but
that
provision
as
the
california
supreme
court
construed
it
was
drawn
to
permit
lear
which
had
an
exclusive
license
to
terminate
in
the
event
that
some
third
party
adjudicated
it
to
be
invalid
and
therefore
acquired
the
right
to
use
it
free.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
but
to
the
sole
extent
that
lear's
rights
to
terminate
and
avoid
its
bargain
are
tied
to
the
--
what
the
patent
office
would
do
what
some
third
party
might
do,
did
not
give
lear
the
right
to
do
it.
in
other
words,
it
is
tied
in
a
limited
way
to
what
might
happen
under
the
patent
laws
but
only
in
a
very
limited
way.
it
doesn't
form
a
part
of
the
consideration.
it
forms
only
the
conditions
subsequent
under
which
lear
can
get
out
of
the
bargain.
now,
assuming
the
sake
of
argument
only
that
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
has
to
be
overturned
then
the
question
becomes
what
happens
to
this
case
thereafter.
now,
although
lear
urges
that
this
court
then
delve
into
the
issues
of
validity
of
the
patent
and
itself
determine
the
issue,
the
government
concedes
that
in
that
situation
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
california
supreme
court
which
has
not
yet
considered
the
issue
of
validity.
it
is
the
policy
of
this
court
that
lower
courts
first
be
given
the
opportunity
to
pass
on
questions
before
this
court
reviews
them.
otherwise,
in
this
case,
the
result
would
be
since
there
are
no
new
or
noble
patent
issues
involved
but
this
court
would
be
sitting
and
performing
a
function
performed
by
the
court
of
claims
for
instance
that,
the
right
of
ordinary
review
rather
than
reviewing
questions
of
law.
moreover,
even
if
the
patent
was
held
invalid
that
would
not
in
the
case,
that
would
still
be
additional
things
that
have
to
be
considered
such
as
the
proper
cut-off
date
for
the
payment
of
royalties
if
the
patent
is
held
invalid.
and
on
this
issue,
the
government
also
concedes
in
its
amicus
brief
that
the
resolution
of
this
issue
where
the
license
is
exclusive
would
depend
upon
state
considerations
of
fairness
between
the
parties.
similarly,
we
would
have
in
this
case
the
right
to
pursue
the
second
cause
of
action.
the
second
cause
of
action
was
an
alternative
cause
of
action
which
existed
for
the
idea,
discovery
and
invention
as
and
unpatented
and
unpatentable
invention.
and
we
took
the
position
under
that
second
cause
of
action
that
if
the
license
agreement
for
some
reason
failed
either
because
of
a
failure
or
consideration
or
because
of
some
illegality
or
for
some
other
reason
that
adkins
was
under
one
of
these
theories
pleaded
there
entitled
to
recover
the
reasonable
value
of
what
he
in
fact
convey
to
lear
when
he
disclosed
the
idea.
now,
although
it's
been
contended
that
mr.
adkins
waived
the
second
cause
of
action
in
its
entirety
he
did
not
in
fact
do
so
of
the
trial
court
had
held
that
mr.
adkins
have
waived
the
entire
cause
of
action
but
on
the
writ
of
mandate
proceeding,
the
district
court
of
appeal
reversed
and
compelled
the
trial
court
judge
to
enter
an
amendment
to
the
judgment
stating
that
the
second
cause
of
action
had
not
been
waived
for
what
adkins
had
disclosed
to
lear
insofar
as
related
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
patent
application.
i
believe
that
concludes
my
presentation.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
because
i'm
referring
to
exhibit
a
attached
to
the
complaint
which
is
the
same
document
and
which
was
admitted
in
the
answer.
well,
it's
incorrect
to
that
extent.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
oh!
yes,
it's
in
the
record
because
it
attached
the
complaint
and
the
answer
admits
that
the
party
signed
this
agreement.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
no,
it
was
admitted
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
it
was
admitted
for
identification
only.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
yes.
you
can
consider
it
because
it
was
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
--
to
the
complaint
as
an
exhibit
and
the
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
well,
in
california
you
do
not
have
to
offer
something
into
evidence
which
is
admitted
once
it
is
admitted
in
the
answer
--
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
no,
it
did
not
because
i
was
trying
to
get
to
another
subject
with
it
but
in
the
answer
it
was
admitted
that
lear
had
signed
this
agreement
and
the
california
supreme
court
in
fact
considered
it
in
its
opinion.
mr.
peter
r.
cohen
that's
correct.
