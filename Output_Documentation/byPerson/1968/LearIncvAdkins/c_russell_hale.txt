mr.
c.
russell
hale
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we're
assembling
a
few
exhibits
that
we
expect
to
demonstrate
to
the
court
to
make
a
point
during
the
argument.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california.
in
simplest
form,
the
case
is
concern
where
the
patent
license
agreement
between
petitioner
lear
and
respondent
adkins
and
the
validity
and
enforcement
under
this
agreement
of
patent
rights,
a
patent
which
ultimately
issued
to
respondent.
the
supreme
court
of
california
has
upheld
this
license
agreement
to
the
practical
effect
that
the
patent
is
immune
from
challenge
of
validity
and
also
to
the
practical
effect
that
established
federal
criteria
need
not
govern
the
determination
of
the
scope
of
the
patent
when
it's
enforced
under
the
agreement
in
question.
what
we're
asking
this
court
is
to
rule
that
the
patent
laws
and
the
protection
afforded
by
them
cannot
be
so
extended
by
private
agreement
between
individual
parties.
we're
asking
that
this
court
rule
that
patent
rights
cannot
be
so
extended
under
state
law
so
as
to
render
the
validity
and
interpretation
of
the
scope
of
the
patent
immune
to
the
criteria
of
the
federal
patent
laws.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes,
your
honor
--
mr.
c.
russell
hale
no,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
no,
your
honor.
there
were
--
there
was
one
patent.
it
was
directed
to
the
device
that
has
been
identified
as
the
california
model
2156
gyros.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
but
your
honor
mentioned
that
--
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes
your
honor.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes,
sir.
well,
your
honor
that
really
highlights
the
federal
issues
that
are
before
this
court,
in
that,
there
was
one
patent
and
it
disclose
essentially
the
structure
of
the
california
model
2156
gyros.
the
michigan
structure
was
independently
developed
a
different
facility
in
view
of
the
procedures
that
were
used
in
assembling
the
california
gyros
and
the
michigan
gyros.
the
michigan
gyros
were
originally
included
as
coming
within
the
scope
of
the
patent
application
and
hints
the
agreement.
so,
an
interpretation
of
the
scope
of
the
patent
application
that
patent
are
very
basic
to
this
questions
that's
before
the
court
likewise,
whether
or
not
lear
has
the
right
to
challenge
the
validity
of
this
patent
raised
it
very
basic
federal
issues
before
this
court.
the
california
supreme
court
based
decisions
solely
under
the
terms
of
a
license
agreement
that
was
entered
into
between
the
parties
in
1955
and
the
california
supreme
court
felt
that
we're
not
concerned
with
defenses
which
might
be
available
to
lear
in
determining
questions
of
validity
and
infringement.
california
supreme
court
apparently
felt
that
the
agreement
was
supreme.
it
need
not
be
concerned
with
the
details
of
federal
law
that
control
patent
matters.
the
court
even
went
so
far
to
say
valid
claims
are
not
required.
but
we
submit
that
parties
should
--
it's
against
pubic
policy
for
parties
to
collaborate
and
export
patent
rights
regardless
of
validity.
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
if
lear
and
adkins
had
so
desired,
it
could've
join
forces,
paid
no
attention
to
whether
or
not
the
patent
was
valid
or
not
but
enforced
it
by
this
year
economic
power
and
that
public
interest
certainly
would
not
be
served
by
such
an
arrangement.
the
california
court
also
when
so
far
as
to
say
it
doesn't
matter
how
this
patent
was
obtained
to
the
patent
office,
patent
every
issues
below,
that's
all
we're
concerned
about.
we
don't
care
whether
new
matter
was
added
in
violation
of
the
federal
rules,
decisions
of
this
court
for
example.
the
california
court
said
we're
not
concerned
if
whether
or
not
fraud
has
practiced
on
the
patent
office.
we
submit
that
those
raise
very
basic
federal
issues
your
honor.
such
a
decision
results
in
extension
of
patent
rights
far
beyond
the
rights
that
would
be
available
in
an
infringement
action.
it
also
permits
individual
states
to
employ
standards
and
patent
matters
that
differ
from
state
to
state.
for
example,
as
matters
stand
today
the
law
in
california
concerning
licensee
estoppel
is
exactly
contra
to
the
law
in
the
state
of
michigan
knowing
the
state
of
minnesota
as
stated
by
the
minnesota
supreme
court
in
1954
in
the
case
of
crew
versus
flanagan
which
is
cited
in
our
briefs.
the
ultimate
result
of
the
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court
is
the
enforcement
of
the
patent
which
the
trial
court
in
california
found
to
be
invalid
as
a
matter
of
law
for
failure
to
meet
the
constitutional
standard
required
for
patentability.
we
submit
that
an
agreement
basing
a
decision
solely
upon
an
agreement
whereby
patent
rights
are
so
extended
is
against
public
policy,
against
the
policies
and
provisions
of
both
the
patent
laws
and
the
antitrust
laws.
if
an
agreement
can
be
employed
to
circumvent
the
constitutional
standard
required
for
patentability,
i.e.
uniform
federal
standards
cannot
be
maintained
in
the
50
states
and
this
is
sticking
example
of
one
state
that
is
out
of
step
with
some
other
states.
the
most
significant
dates
and
events
that
are
involved
in
this
case
are
set
forth
in
the
chart
that
i
have
behind
the
lectern
and
i
will
refer
to
these
dates
during
my
argument.
the
adkins'
patent
application
in
the
subject
matter
ensued
was
filed
in
february
of
1954.
the
agreement
was
entered
into
in
september
1955.
it
is
the
first
document
in
appendix
2
of
the
record
which
we
reproduce.
the
rights
and
the
obligations
of
the
parties
under
this
agreement
are
based
on
the
claims
are
set
forth
in
the
patent
application
which
was
filed
by
adkins
in
1954.
and
only
to
the
extent
that
the
claims
are
patentable,
the
agreement
is
very
explicit
in
this
regard.
lear
agreed
to
pay
royalties
on
its
products
that
employ
the
invention
that
is
defined
by
the
claims
that
are
patentable.
now
contrary
to
the
repeated
assertions
of
adkins
that
the
agreement
was
based
upon
the
secret
ideas
discoveries
and
unpatentable
things,
the
california
supreme
court
expressly
based
its
decision
on
adkins'
patent
rights
under
this
agreement.
for
example
in
appendix
1
at
page
192
the
california
supreme
court
said,
the
agreement
clearly
sets
forth
that
royalties
are
to
be
paid
only
for
patented
or
patentable
claims
which
lear
utilized
in
its
products.
now,
although
the
agreement
and
the
patent
applications
covered
several
devices
and
features
only
the
feature
of
bearing
alignment,
supporting
bearings
and
alignment
for
rotatable
devices
involved
in
this
action.
the
technical
subject
matter
is
almost
identical
with
that
which
is
before
this
court
many
years
ago
in
singer
versus
cramer
which
is
cited
in
our
briefs.
now,
the
patent
application
and
the
patent
which
is
ultimately
issued
are
also
reproduced
in
appendix
2
at
pages
18
and
32,
the
circumstances
under
which
this
dispute
arose
once
that
adkins
was
employed
by
lear
in
1951
under
an
agreement
which
permitted
him
to
retain
title
to
certain
inventions.
this
was
covered
by
a
preliminary
agreement
which
is
not
--
which
is
never
admitted
in
evidence
because
it
was
superseded
and
cancelled
by
the
1955
agreement
which
is
item
number
2
in
my
chart.
lear
had
two
facilities
that
at
that
time
one
was
in
california
and
the
other
one
was
in
michigan
and
adkins
did
his
work
in
the
california
facility
and
he
developed
along
with
other
lear
employees
this
model
2156
gyros.
at
the
same
time,
mr.
cureston
in
michigan
was
developing
the
so-called
michigan
gyro
and
in
1955,
lear
started
manufacturing
and
selling
both
of
these
devices
and
they
are
both
employed
in
military
equipment
almost
exclusively
in
military
equipment.
and
when
the
license
agreement
was
consummated,
the
patent
application
was
directed
primarily
to
the
way
the
devices
were
assembled.
and
as
i
mentioned
earlier
in
response
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
question,
the
two
products
were
included
as
covered
by
the
agreement
at
that
time
because
of
the
similarity
of
the
methods.
in
1957,
lear
conducted
a
search
of
prior
art
and
it
found
that
this
method
couldn't
be
patentable
to
adkins
that
call
the
prior
art
to
his
attention
and
at
that
time,
it
renounced
any
further
liability
on
the
michigan
steel
gyros,
that's
item
number
3.
now,
the
patent
application
was
rejected
several
times
and
amended
several
times
and
one
amendment
of
particular
importance
is
that
of
december
1958
prior
to
this
amendment,
the
application
was
directed
to
the
characteristic
features
of
the
model
2156
gyros.
subsequent
to
this
amendment,
it
was
directed
primary
that
the
characteristic
features
of
the
michigan
steel
gyros.
for
example,
prior
to
the
amendment
the
application
did
not
say
one
word
about
removable
bearings
yet
subsequent
to
the
amendment,
the
application
contains
such
wording
and
adkins
has
relied
very
heavily
on
that
added
wording
in
briefs
before
the
california
supreme
court
and
also
before
this
court
emphasizing
this
very
feature
that
was
added
by
amendment
many
years
later.
in
early
1959,
the
claims
directed
to
bearing
alignment
were
under
adjudging
by
the
patent
office,
all
of
them
were
under
adjudging.
the
application
have
been
pending
for
five
years,
lear
not
received
what
it
bargains
for
under
this
executory
contract
which
has
some
patent
rights.
so,
on
the
april
8,
1959
--
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
talking
about
the
entire
agreement
which
the
agreement
--
the
lear's
position
as
of
1959,
april
1959
was
that
we
have
stopped
paying
royalties
as
of
1957
because
--
mr.
c.
russell
hale
on
the
michigan
steel
gyros
but
they
continued
to
pay
royalties
on
the
california
gyros.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
well,
not
--
no,
your
honor.
as
of
this
day
--
mr.
c.
russell
hale
--
1955
the
two
products
were
listed
in
this
contract.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
as
of
this
day,
lear
said,
our
search
reveal,
you
cannot
possibly
get
the
claims
covering
the
process.
so,
we're
going
to
seize
paying
royalties.
we
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
c.
russell
hale
on
the
michigan.
we're
going
to
continue
on
the
california
model
2156
and
right
here
is
where
we
come
into
the
scope
question
of
enforcement
of
the
patent
under
state
laws,
your
honor.
as
of
this
day,
lear
said,
we
don't
seem
to
be
getting
anything.
we've
been
carrying
this
agreement
for
years,
no
patent
is
issued,
we
don't
think
it's
going
to
be
any
good
once
it
does
issue.
so,
we're
going
to
terminate
the
agreement
and
lear
served
the
notice
of
termination
--
mr.
c.
russell
hale
as
to
both.
as
to
the
whole
work,
your
honor.
under
expressed
provisions
of
the
agreement,
one
of
the
agreements
says,
lear
shall
have
the
right
on
90
days
prior
written
notice
to
terminate
any
of
the
licenses
in
this
agreement.
and
lear
said,
“all
right,
we
have
the
right,
we
terminate
the
whole
works.”
mr.
c.
russell
hale
no
your
honor,
that
provisions
appears
in
section
2
(a)
of
the
license
agreement,
it's
on
page
4.
if
i
may
direct
your
attention
to
the
specific,
it's
on
page
4
of
appendix
a
(2),
the
large
one.
section
paragraph
2
(a)
the
very
last
sentence,
it's
about
two-thirds
of
the
way
down
to
page.
it
says,
“lear
shall
have
the
right
on
90
days
prior
written
notice
to
adkins
to
terminate
any
one
or
more
of
the
licenses
herein
granted.”
mr.
c.
russell
hale
that's
--
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
well,
the
state
court
upon
considering
that
specific
pair
of
that
specific
sentence
said,
“we
find
an
implied
condition
that
requires
that
you
manufact
--
that
you
seize
manufacturing
these
devices
before
you
can
terminate.”
now,
this
did
not
arise
below
in
the
trial
level.
the
trial
court
said,
“the
agreement
is
--
was
terminated,
lear
exercised
its
rights.”
intermediate
appellate
court
said
the
same
thing.
california
supreme
court
found
this
implied
condition
and
it
is
our
position
your
honor
that
such
an
implied
condition
is
most
certainly
contrary
to
the
purposes
and
provisions
of
the
patent
and
antitrust
laws.
this
is
a
circumstance
that
arose
only
upon
the
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court.
so,
as
of
april
8,
1959,
it
was
lear's
position
that
the
entire
agreement
was
cancelled
which
covered
both
of
the
products.
now,
some
eight
or
nine
months
later
adkins
pushed
his
patent
through
the
patent
office,
they
issued
in
early
1960
and
the
complaint
was
filed
on
the
same
day.
the
complaint
searched
first
cause
of
action
asserting
breach
of
license
agreement
of
exhibit
8
and
unjust
arrangement
and
at
the
second
cause
of
action
misappropriation
of
adkins'
ideas
discovers
an
inventions
in
violation
of
his
common
law
rights.
now,
the
second
cause
of
action
was
dismissed
and
was
never
tried.
the
trial
court
took
and
ruled
that
lear
terminate
the
license
agreement
by
this
notice
in
1959
and
the
jury
returned
the
verdict
for
adkins
on
the
basis
of
both
products,
the
california
of
2156
and
the
michigan
steel
gyros.
the
trial
court
granted
lear's
motion
not
standing
the
verdict
concerning
the
michigan
steel
gyros
and
it
left
to
direct
the
verdict
concerning
a
california
gyros
stand.
trial
court
said
that
lear
has
not
stopped
to
contest
validity
with
respect
to
the
michigan
steel
gyros
because
they
were
independently
developed
also
because
the
claims
of
the
patent
do
no
cover
the
michigan
steel
gyros.
and
also
patent
is
invalid
or
as
that
trial
court
is
concerned
is
failing
to
meet
the
constitutional
standard
required
for
patentability
relying
upon
the
a&p
case
of
this
court.
well,
the
intermediate
appellate
court
of
california
ruled
generally
along
the
same
line.
i
won't
discuss
it
because
that
decision
has
rendered
a
nullity
of
when
the
california
supreme
court
takes
the
case.
california
supreme
court
held
that
this
termination
was
ineffective
because
of
this
implied
condition
that
we've
just
mentioned.
it
then
adopted
the
defense
of
licensee
estoppel
which
was
asserted
by
adkins
and
held
that
lear
was
estopped
to
contest
the
validity
of
the
patent
and
was
liable
for
royalties.
it
also
used
some
criteria
in
ascertaining
the
scope
of
the
invention
and
infringement
that
we
feel
are
clearly
in
violation
of
decision
of
this
court
for
example.
but
under
the
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court,
lear
has
two
alternatives.
one
is
to
pay
the
royalties
regardless
of
the
patent
invalidity
and
failure
consideration.
or
seize
manufacturing
the
devices,
it's
deprived
of
the
alternative
of
continuing
a
manufacture
of
the
products
purportedly
covered
by
the
claims
of
adkins'
patent
application
in
challenging
validity.
and
this
renders
any
licensee
that
challenges
validity
vulnerable
to
suit
of
infringement
and
imposition
of
damages
which
maybe
a
much
greater
magnitude
and
than
those
imposed
under
an
agreement.
so,
a
licensee
has
to
be
very
well
advised
before
he
wants
to
take
such
a
step.
well,
now,
the
issues
are
the
major
questions
before
this
court
are
--
mr.
c.
russell
hale
no
your
honor.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
well,
your
honor
you're
going
to
that
to
the
crux
of
one
of
the
issues
in
this
case
and
that

exclusive.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes
sir.
well,
your
honor
the
agreement
is
explicit.
and
this
agreement
superseded
cancelled
all
other
agreements.
lear
for
example,
wanted
to
go
in
to
things
of
that
nature
and
it
presented
and
exhibit
u
for
admission
and
evidence
under
an
offer
of
proof
at
reporter's
transcript
1018
where
adkins
says
in
representations
leading
up
to
the
license
agreement
is
impossible
for
me
to
give
lear
a
license
on
claims
which
may
not
be
allowed
or
are
not
patentable.
now,
evidence
along
as
this
line
was
excluded
by
the
trial
court,
the
trial
court
said,
“you're
under
this
agreement
and
this
agreement
limit
you
to
patented
or
patentable
things
and
not
secret
ideas,
not
discoveries,
nothing
unpatentable
is
covered.”
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
your
honor,
there
was
a
waiver
just
before
trial
of
all
causes
of
action
other
than
the
issues
raised
by
the
license
agreement.
so,
all
ideas
or
out
of
picture,
know-how
out
of
the
picture,
the
license
agreement
doesn't
mention
know-how
in
any
place
nor
does
it
mention
ideas.
the
only
thing
it
mentions
are
things
that
are
patented
or
patentable
and
hence,
we
submit
that
brings
that
directly
under
the
federal
criteria
concerning
patent
matters.
well,
the
major
questions
before
this
court
are
the
enforceability
of
such
an
agreement
containing
a
restraint
which
is
outside
the
scope
of
the
rights
provided
in
the
patent
laws.
number
2,
the
applicability
of
licensee
estoppel
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
and
as
the
general
principle
whether
the
claims
of
adkins'
patent
application
are
really
unpatentable
and
invalid
as
a
matter
of
law
like
the
superior
court
of
the
state
of
california
held.
and
there
is
question
number
4,
whether
the
ground
rules
in
enforcing
a
patent
under
a
license
agreement
are
the
same
as
they
are
in
enforcing
a
patent
in
an
infringement
action.
and
the
california
supreme
court
didn't
use
the
same
ground
rules.
otherwise,
they
could've
never
held
that
the
michigan
steel
gyros
are
covered
by
the
claims
of
the
patent.
well,
as
to
question
number
1,
enforceability
of
such
an
agreement,
the
requirement
that
lear
sees
manufacturing
the
products
covered
by
the
license
agreement
in
order
to
terminate
is
not
an
act
granted
by
the
patent
laws.
their
tendency
of
patent
application
provides
no
vested
rights
in
fact
the
patent
may
never
issue
and
this
we
submit
is
similar
to
the
situation
in
brulotte
versus
thys
where
this
court
held
that
an
agreement
which
attempts
to
extend
patent
rights
beyond
the
17-year
period,
patents
are
good
for
17
years
and
if
the
patent
is
attempted
to
be
extended
beyond
that
period,
it's
an
improper
use
of
patent
rights.
we
submit
that
the
very
same
considerations
apply
here
where
the
patent
rights
are
attempted
to
be
extended
before
they
really
issue.
we
submit
that
this,
such
a
provision
which
is
at
california
supreme
court
found
was
implied
in
the
agreement,
renders
it
unenforceable.
such
an
unwarranted
extension
of
patent
rights
is
particularly
objectionable
here
where
products
affected
are
military
equipment.
this
is
because
of
the
policy
embodied
in
28
u.s.c.
1498
which
permits
use
by
the
government
of
all
inventions
without
possibility
of
injunction.
it
also
safeguards
government
from
payment
of
royalties
on
species
patents
because
validity
can
always
be
attacked.
now,
with
reference
to
the
second
major
question
concerning
estoppel,
the
government
has
filed
a
brief
as
amicus
curiae
are
urging
that
this
court
should
complete
reject
any
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
and
advised
that
counsel
for
the
government,
mr.
wallace
will
direct
his
oral
argument
to
the
broad
grounds
and
accordingly
i
will
discuss
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
lear
specifically
renounced
any
liability.
it
renounced
liability
with
respect
to
the
michigan
steel
gyros
in
1957.
it
renounced
liability
under
the
whole
agreement
as
of
1959.
this
placed
adkins
in
the
position
that
he
could've
charged
lear
as
an
infringer
if
he
had
so
desired.
he
elected
to
bring
suit
for
royalties
and
he
relies
very
heavily
on
the
hazeltine
case
in
support
of
his
position.
when
the
hazeltine
case,
there
was
no
renouncement
of
the
license
agreement
prior
to
the
suit
against
hazeltine.
they
just
didn't
pay
royalties,
didn't
make
royalty
reports,
this
is
all
brought
out
in
the
lower
court
decisions.
under
the
hazeltine
case,
the
license
order
didn't
have
the
right
to
sue
for
infringement.
it
was
an
outstanding
agreement.
the
party
simply
had
not
paid
royalties.
here,
lear
has
renounced
and
adkins
had
a
choice.
he
chose
to
proceed
under
the
agreement
and
the
various
cases
cited
in
our
brief,
show
that
under
such
circumstances
where
there
is
a
renouncement,
assertion
of
pay
or
consideration,
lear
has
the
right
to
challenge
the
validity
of
that
patent.
the
dale
tile
company
case
is
his
one
along
this
line
and
--
mr.
c.
russell
hale
the
amount
of
the
judgment
on
the
california
model
2156
gyros
was
a
little
over
$16,000.00.
on
the
michigan
steel
gyros,
it
was
--
well,
it
was
almost
$900,000.00.
it
was
$888,000.00
i
believe.
now,
that
was
as
of
1963
your
honor
and
which
was
a
period
agreed
upon
for
accounting
purposes
only.
and
of
course
that
the
same
thing
applies
today,
it's
been
going
on
lear
is
doing
the
same
thing
today,
it
was
during
1963.
with
defense
of
failure
of
consideration
as
well
established
defense
in
contract
matters
and
that's
what
lear
asserted.
and
that's
a
defense
of
record
in
the
trial
court,
in
the
pleadings
and
we
submit
that
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
should
not
override
such
a
well-known
and
undisputed
defense.
second
circumstance
of
this
case
was
that
the
license
to
lear
was
granted
under
patent
application.
that
was
altered
by
amendment,
numerous
amendments
were
filed
in
this
application
and
as
i
pointed
out
one
of
major
importance
was
filed
in
december
1958
which
change
the
tender
of
face.
patent
issue
with
claims
lear
never
seen
it
invoked
the
rule
of
estoppel
under
such
circumstances
gives
the
license
order
of
a
patent
application
the
right
to
change
the
gist
of
his
invention,
covered
products
that
weren't
originally
considered
to
be
covered.
it
--
in
essence
places
the
licensee
at
the
mercy
of
the
licensor
with
no
mean
to
readdress.
now
we
submit
that
licensee
estoppel
should
not
apply
if
the
agreement
is
based
upon
a
patent
application
which
is
in
fact
changed
--
which
is
in
fact
amended
from
time
to
time
after
execution
of
the
agreement.
the
third
circumstance
of
this
case
is
that
the
--
has
i've
already
mentioned
the
license
agreement
as
construed
by
the
california
supreme
court
embodied
and
implied
condition
for
termination
that
requires
lear
to
seize
manufacturing
the
products
of
the
agreement
in
order
to
terminate
it.
as
this
court
held
in
macgregor
versus
westinghouse,
the
rule
of
licensee
estoppel
cannot
be
used
as
a
shield
to
preclude
investigation
of
the
validity
of
a
patent
where
in
the
absence
of
a
valid
patent
it
would
be
a
restraint
of
trade
and
certainly
that's
a
circumstance
here.
the
requirement
that
lear
seize
manufacturing
the
devices
as
a
restraint
a
trade
and
in
licensee
estoppel
should
not
be
implied
as
a
shield
to
prevent
lear
from
defenses
concerning
this
issue.
anyone
of
these
three
circumstances
is
sufficient
to
override
any
estoppel
if
an
adversity
job
of
the
doctrine
still
survives
and
mr.
wallace
will
discuss
that
on
behalf
of
the
government.
now,
lear's
third
and
fourth
questions
relate
to
the
validity
and
the
scope
of
adkins'
patent,
these
are
always
interrelated
because
the
patent
of
certain
scope
then
claims
must
not
read
on
the
prior
order
otherwise,
it's
rendered
invalid.
and
these
two
questions
require
an
understanding
of
the
bearing
supporting
apparatus
of
the
michigan
steel
gyros
and
that
california
model
2156
gyros
and
i
think
perhaps
this
will
help
clarify
some
of
the
questions
that
mr.
justice
fortas
was
raising
earlier.
the
alignment
arrangements
if
i
may
ask
the
court
to
refer
to
figure
9
of
lear's
reply
brief
at
page
50.
the
two
alignment
arrangements
are
shown
there
in
simplified
form.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
lear's
reply
brief
your
honor.
it's
the
gray
covered,
very
small
brief
towards
the
end
at
page
50.
you
will
find
two
figures
illustrating
adkins'
patent
and
one
figure
illustrating
the
michigan
steel
gyro.
now,
adkins'
patent
shows
a
bearing
supporting
apparatus
which
implies
a
cone-shaped
seat
in
a
gimbal
housing
and
spherical
shape
bearing
couch.
and
the
patent
states
that
those
elements
are
shown
at
both
the
top
and
bottom
of
the
figures
concerning
adkins's
patent
and
i
will
elaborate
on
that
little
more
in
the
moment.
the
patent
states,
the
bearings
may
be
aligned
by
placing
them
on
a
jig
or
mandrel
and
then
placing
them
in
the
bearing
or
seeding
elements
as
we've
illustrate.
when
the
mandrel
is
rotated,
it
causes
the
bearings
to
become
align
and
this
is
accommodated
by
the
engaging
surfaces
between
the
cylindrical
shape
bearing
cups
in
the
cone-shaped
seats,
in
view
of
their
different
curved
shapes.
i'm
purporting
more
or
less
from
the
patent
i
believe
exactly
from
it.
now
at
the
trial,
we
use
this
demonstration
to
illustrate
the
two
types
of
services
we're
talking
about
the
cone-shaped
seat
are
the
two
seats
in
the
framework
that's
shown
on
figure
9
and
the
segment
--
the
other
members
are
spherical
shape,
they're
portion
of
spear
and
we've
illustrated
this
by
a
piece
of
a
croquet
ball.
this
shows
the
type
of
action
that
adkins
used
in
order
to
achieve
alignment.
it
provides
angular
and
the
so-called
angular
tilt
that
you'll
see
referred
to
in
the
briefs
due
to
the
two
surfaces
that
are
involved
that
accommodate
this
kind
of
movement.
now,
we
have
a
model
here
in
court
showing
the
alignment
of
the
bearings
and
accordance
with
adkins'
patent,
this
was
demonstrated
at
the
trial
and
i
think
it's
essential
if
the
court
will
bear
with
me.
i
believe
it's
essential
for
thorough
understanding
of
the
issue
of
scope
--
scope
of
the
patent,
definite
patent
and
patent
application
that
are
involved
in
this
action.
so,
mr.
hartz
will
demonstrate
this
model,
it's
approximately
four
times
the
actual
size
of
the
actual
parts
in
reality.
it
shows
a
cone-shaped
seat
like
the
paddle
that
i
just
demonstrated.
it
has
bearing
caps
with
a
spherical
surface.
this
is
the
spherical
surface
much
like
the
croquet
ball
and
that
i
demonstrated.
it
has
bearings
for
mounting
in
the
bearing
caps
which
ultimately
go
into
the
seats
which
in
the
framework.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
this
is
the
left
hand
portion
adkins'
patent.
adkins'
patent
and
the
21
--
the
california
model
2156
gyro
was
very
similar
your
honor.
as
the
cone-shaped
member
here,
the
spherical
shape
member
here
or
receiving
bearing
element
there,
this
is
very
much
like
the
top
thing
that
shown
on
the
first
one
as
you
can
see
it
and
there's
a
small
cut
away
there.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
now,
the
patent
says
these
bearings
are
sled
on
a
jig
or
mandrel
which
may
be
a
cylindrical
rod.
this
jig
or
mandrel
simply
an
assembly
to
which
is
taken
after
later
and
we
will
demonstrate
that.
the
bearings
are
then
placed
into
the
bearing
caps
and
then
they
in
turn
of
course
were
in
the
framework
in
their
cone-shaped
seats.
the
mandrel
is
rotated
and
due
to
the
nature
of
the
engaging
surfaces
which
permit
this
type
of
movement
alignment
is
achieved.
as
soon
as
that's
done,
some
of
it
is
placed
around
there
to
hold
them
in
place.
the
patent
states
that
other
arrangements
can
be
used
like
screws
or
welding
what
have
you.
thereafter,
the
jig
is
removed
then
the
gyro
is
then
ready
to
put
together
in
final
form.
now,
the
alignment
of
the
michigan
steel
gyros
is
illustrated
in
the
right
--
corner
right
hand
corner
of
figure
9
and
we
will
now
demonstrate
that.
here
is
the
jig
which
appears
in
the
center
of
figure
9.
this
is
taken
from
exhibit
o
and
it
was
admitted
in
evidence
and
is
part
of
the
assembly
procedure
that's
been
throughout
this
trial.
here's
the
little
mandrel
or
jig
as
actually
employed
in
production
in
the
michigan
steel
gyro.
you
will
notice
that
one
end
has
a
little
bearing
cap
on
it
and
the
other
hand
i
will
put
one
on
right
now.
this
fits
snuggly
and
not
only
that
but
they
are
fixed
by
a
screws
and
washers
so
that
they
are
absolutely
rigid
those
bearing
caps
when
there
are
mounted
on
this.
and
they
are
now
in
alignment
right
now
no
matter
what
you
do
with
them.
those
bearing
caps
are
in
the
alignment
and
will
stay
that
way.
no
angular
motion,
no
tilt,
bearing
alignment.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
the
mandrel
is
this
portion
here
your
honor
and
here
are
the
two
bearing
caps.
we
have
a
larger
model
little
piece
here
for
the
court
to
see.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes,
your
honor
and
these
terms
have
all
been
used
interchangeably.
i
feel
compelled
to
use
them,
more
or
less
interchangeably.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes,
your
honor.
now,
here's
the
characteristic
structure
of
the
bearing
caps
in
the
michigan
steel
gyros.
it's
a
total
--
the
total
thing
has
been
sometimes
characterizes
as
a
cylindrical
top
cap
placed
in
a
loose
hole,
loosely
fitting
hole.
and
here,
it's
loose.
i'm
going
to
assemble
that
and
show
the
court
just
exactly
how
the
alignment
is
achieved.
again,
this
is
approximately
four
times
scale.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
this
is
four
times
--
mr.
c.
russell
hale
for
the
benefit
--
mr.
c.
russell
hale
actual.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
no
sir,
your
honor
we
have
here
in
court
the
actual
housings
that
those
--
that
the
mandrel
goes
into
if
i
may
demonstrate
the
--
it
goes
into
a
loose
hole
on
this
end,
the
loose
hole
on
this
end.
the
thing
is
submitted
in
place
or
well
that
what
have
you
and
then
the
mandrel
can
be
removed.
it's
ready
for
final
assembly
and
here
are
the
packages
as
ready.
if
you'll
--
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes,
your
honor
that's
right
out
the
production.
for
the
characteristic
of
alignment
in
the
michigan
steel
gyros
still
uses
a
mandrel
like
the
california
model
2156
but
that
that's
about
the
end
of
the
resemblance
and
that
mandrel
is
taken
out
not
used
--
adkins
tried
to
get
claims
covering
the
procedure
for
alignment.
the
way
i
just
demonstrated
on
the
model
2156,
he
tried
and
tried
and
tried
and
he
was
turned
down
every
time
on
his
method
claims
and
they
cancelled
those.
we
submit
that
puts
him
in
the
public
domain
and
he
cannot
now
claim
that
the
method
is
the
same
to
employ
the
same
thing.
california
supreme
court
said
it
wasn't
obligated
to
look
at
the
file
history
concerning
these
aspects
because
the
claims
that
were
presented
in
that
application
were
brand
new.
it
represented
down
to
very
end
of
the
prosecution.
well,
we
submit
that
that's
not
the
law,
the
criteria
that's
been
established
by
this
court
and
many
other
court
say
you
have
to
look
at
the
whole
file
history
in
order
to
ascertain
what
the
claim
really
mean.
the
california
supreme
court
actually
--
well,
in
interpreting
the
scope
of
adkins'
patent,
the
california
supreme
court
said,
“the
device
of
submitted
in
bearing
caps
using
a
mandrel
procedure
constitutes
the
essence
of
adkins'
invention
as
described
in
his
application.”
well,
that's
the
essence
of
his
invention,
it's
in
the
public
domain
because
he
cancelled
that
the
method
in
a
mandrel
procedure,
the
language
i've
just
quoted
from
is
in
appendix
(a)
(1)
(192).
now,
this
is
one
of
the
criteria
that
we
feel
that
the
california
supreme
court
applied
in
improperly.
and
other
major
thing
was
that
the
california
supreme
court
states
that
alignment
of
bearing
caps
in
either
adkins
or
the
steel
gyros
can
be
accomplished
only
by
the
angular
displacement
of
the
two
caps
to
the
access
of
the
mandrel.
well,
if
it
please
the
court,
it's
impossible
for
either
these
two
caps
to
be
displaced
to
the
access
of
the
mandrel.
it's
an
absolute
physical
impossibility
and
we
submit
that
that's
a
major
error.
if
i
may
indulge
the
court,
i
would
like
to
refer
now
to
our
opening
brief.
i
believe
that's
blue
at
figure
4
which
is
opposite
page
57.
this
figure
4-2
sets
forth
the
main
claim
of
adkins'
patent
application
and
the
patent
which
issued
which
illustrated
here.
i
will
refer
to
the
figures
since
the
print
is
a
little
small
here
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
letters
a,
b
and
c
identify
the
three
elements
of
this
invention
and
adkins
admits
that
those
three
elements
are
old,
old
in
the
art.
he
simply
says,
they
have
a
new
cooperative
relationship
but
when
he
applies
his
new
cooperative
relationship
he
didn't
talking
about
things
in
the
claim.
and
it's
the
claim
that
defines
the
invention.
now,
this
is
one
of
the
exhibits
employed
in
the
trial
court,
and
i
use
it
only
for
the
purpose
of
illustration.
it's
the
left
hand
figure
of
exhibit
4-1
and
i
just
referred
the
court
to.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
color
code
on
all
of
these
things
is
the
same,
red
means
bearing
caps
and
so
forth.
and
you'll
see
here
a
red
element
of
bearing
cap
designated
a,
a
bearing
proceeding
frame
b,
and
means
for
holding
that
bearing
cap
in
place
designated
c.
now,
the
bearing
receiving
element
is
in
a
sloppy
hole
and
loosely
fitting
hole
just
like
the
michigan
steel
gyros.
and
alignment
is
achieved
by
use
of
this
feature.
now,
i
will
rely
--
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes
your
honor.
this
goes
to
the
issue
of
validity
and
scope
if
adkins'
claims
read
on
this
michigan
steel
gyros
i
just
demonstrated.
they
also
read
right
on
this
--
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes
your
honor
and
also
on
several
others
and
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice
i
believe
i
have
about
five
minutes
left,
i'd
like
to
reserve
it.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
morning
we
spent
a
lot
of
time
on
something
that
we
had
no
trial
on.
the
trial
court
limited
us
to
the
express
terms
of
this
license
agreement.
we
--
pardon
me.
we
endeavor
to
present
evidence
leading
up
to
the
consummation
of
this
agreement,
a
background
material,
the
trial
court
excluded,
expressly
excluded
all
of
that.
the
trial
court
said,
you're
here
on
an
agreement
or
you're
here
on
something
else,
why
are
you
here
on?
it
required
adkins
to
elect.
adkins
wanted
to
go
in
under
the
idea,
discovery,
invention
and
common
law.
the
trial
court
says,
you
can't
ride
both
those
horses.
you
have
to
pick
the
agreement
or
the
common
law,
which
are
you
on?
and
adkins
picked
the
agreement.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
i
think
it
was
your
honor.
the
two
causes
of
action
are
antagonistic
to
one
another,
they
are
i
might
say
mutually
exclusive
as
i
indicated
yesterday
the
common
law
relies
upon
secrecy,
nondisclosure.
patent
law
relies
upon
disclosure.
there
was
an
agreement,
adkins
pleaded
the
agreement
and
that's
what
we're
here
on.
now,
for
example
this
--
mr.
c.
russell
hale
sir?
mr.
c.
russell
hale
no,
i
thought
i'm
in
complete
agreement
with
the
court's
decision
and
that
has
not
been
overturned
your
honor.
that
was
the
way
the
thing
went
up
all
the
way.
now,
this
is
enabled
the
presentation
of
numerous
incorrect
statements
as
to
the
facts
because
they're
just
not
in
the
record.
now
a
lot
of
the
facts,
of
this
court
heard
this
morning,
are
not
in
the
record
because
the
trial
court
won't
let
us
put
them
in
the
record.
for
example,
today,
you
heard
that
adkins
alone
negotiated
with
lear
and
this
is
set
forth
in
adkins'
brief
at
page
15,
he
gives
a
couple
of
reporters
transcripts
citations
and
i
ask
this
court
to
read
those
two
citations
and
see
if
adkins
was
represented
by
counsel
or
not.
they
don't
say.
now,
at
the
trial,
we
tried
to
present
evidence
concerning
this
as
i
pointed
out
and
it
was
excluded.
exhibit
u
is
down
in
the
record,
in
the
archives.
we
made
an
offer
of
proof
of
exhibit
u
at
our
--
at
the
reporter's
transcript
1018.
exhibit
u
says,
i
have
read
over
the
license
agreement
and
i
found
it
to
be
generally
in
good
shape.
however,
prior
to
submitting
it
to
my
lawyer
for
his
comments
and
interpretation
of
certain
legal
phraseology
i
would
like
to
go
into
certain
details.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
this
was
exhibit
u
presented
by
lear,
it
was
not
admitted
because
the
trial
court
says,
i'm
not
going
to
let
you
go
into
the
details
of
this
agreement.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
oh!
pardon
me
your
honor.
this
is
written
by
adkins
to
mr.
bloomberg
who
was
a
lawyer
for
lear.
so,
this
was
a
communication
by
john
adkins
concerning
the
license
agreement
directed
to
lear
and
it
says
prior
to
submit
again.
now,
adkins
is
saying,
prior
to
submitting
it
to
my
lawyer
for
his
comments.
now,
this
is
dated
november
26,
1954.
there
are
several
other
pieces
of
--
this
is
not
an
evidence
your
honor,
this
was
for
identification
only
but
it
is
down
here
in
this
--
in
the
archives
and
i
just
want
to
point
out
that
this
one
of
the
things
that
we've
been
going
into
today
that
that
we
never
had
trial
on.
i
don't
consider
this
part
of
the
record.
i
considered
it
improper
for
adkins
to
say
he
wasn't
represented
by
legal
counsel
when
things
that
were
excluded
from
the
evidence
show
that
he
was.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
that
is
correct
your
honor.
but
it
was
stated
as
a
fact
this
morning
that's
why
i'm
bringing
it
up.
now,
another
point
i
would
like
to
discuss
is
--
mr.
c.
russell
hale
you'll
find
nothing
in
the
record
that
clarifies
that
for
the
court
and
i
simply
feel.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes.
well,
your
honor
we
were
not
permitted
to
go
into
that.
there
simply
no
record
on
it.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
well,
i
have
some
idea
but
i
don't
believe
it's
proper
for
me
to
tell
the
court
my
ideas.
i
think
we're
here
on
the
record.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
well,
i
gave
you
this
as
an
example
to
show
we're
discussing
things
this
morning
that
aren't
before
the
court.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
alright.
your
honor,
adkins
was
an
employee
of
lear.
he
would
go
to
lear
from
time
to
time
and
discuss
this.
there
wasn't
any
hurry
about
this
agreement.
they
were
negotiating
it
arguing
back
and
forth
and
this
was
a
very
leisurely
thing.
he
dropped
in
and
chat
about
it
and
go
away
and
say,
i'll
talk
to
my
lawyer
about
it.
three
months
later,
he'd
come
back
and
say
something
else
and
it
was
just
that
sort
of
thing.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes,
your
honor.
now,
another
thing
much
of
the
argument
today
has
been
based
upon
the
discussion
of
these
idea,
discoveries,
and
inventions
apart
from
patent
rights.
well,
again,
the
record
shows
that
this
issue
was
eliminated
at
the
outset
of
this
action
and
no
evidence
was
permitted
on
this.
we're
talking
about
things
that
we
don't
have
the
record
on.
we
simply
we're
not
permitted
to
go
in
to
this
sort
of
thing.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
no
sir,
your
honor
it
has
the
same
status
in
the
record
as
this
document
i've
just
read
it
to
the
court.
the
one
page
agreement
is
reprinted
as
the
very
last
document
in
the
big
appendix.
it
was
never
admitted.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
mr.
adkins
designated
for
inclusion
in
the
record
if
you
will
notice
we
say
exhibit
7
for
identification
only.
this
document
was
never
admitted
and
the
reason
it
was
never
admitted
is
the
trial
court
said,
we're
going
to
trial
on
the
agreement
of
exhibit
8
and
nothing
else
is
material,
nothing
else
is
permitted.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes,
your
honor.
we
were
never
permitted
to
develop
a
record
of
any
kind
going
--
leading
of
the
thing
--
leading
up
to
the
consummation
of
this
agreement.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
that's
--
mr.
c.
russell
hale
i
think
we're
both
referring
to
the
same
thing
your
honor
--
mr.
c.
russell
hale
would
you
so
agree
mr.
cohen
that
we're
referring
–
he's
referring
to
the
pleadings
and
i'm
referring
to
the
exhibits.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
no,
that's
beyond
question
your
honor
but
the
trial
court
excluded
it
because
license
agreement,
paragraph
13
of
the
license
agreement
says,
this
agreement
supersedes
and
cancels
the
agreement
which
has
been
brought.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we're
assembling
a
few
exhibits
that
we
expect
to
demonstrate
to
the
court
to
make
a
point
during
the
argument.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california.
in
simplest
form,
the
case
is
concern
where
the
patent
license
agreement
between
petitioner
lear
and
respondent
adkins
and
the
validity
and
enforcement
under
this
agreement
of
patent
rights,
a
patent
which
ultimately
issued
to
respondent.
the
supreme
court
of
california
has
upheld
this
license
agreement
to
the
practical
effect
that
the
patent
is
immune
from
challenge
of
validity
and
also
to
the
practical
effect
that
established
federal
criteria
need
not
govern
the
determination
of
the
scope
of
the
patent
when
it's
enforced
under
the
agreement
in
question.
what
we're
asking
this
court
is
to
rule
that
the
patent
laws
and
the
protection
afforded
by
them
cannot
be
so
extended
by
private
agreement
between
individual
parties.
we're
asking
that
this
court
rule
that
patent
rights
cannot
be
so
extended
under
state
law
so
as
to
render
the
validity
and
interpretation
of
the
scope
of
the
patent
immune
to
the
criteria
of
the
federal
patent
laws.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes,
your
honor
--
mr.
c.
russell
hale
no,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
no,
your
honor.
there
were
--
there
was
one
patent.
it
was
directed
to
the
device
that
has
been
identified
as
the
california
model
2156
gyros.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
but
your
honor
mentioned
that
--
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes
your
honor.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes,
sir.
well,
your
honor
that
really
highlights
the
federal
issues
that
are
before
this
court,
in
that,
there
was
one
patent
and
it
disclose
essentially
the
structure
of
the
california
model
2156
gyros.
the
michigan
structure
was
independently
developed
a
different
facility
in
view
of
the
procedures
that
were
used
in
assembling
the
california
gyros
and
the
michigan
gyros.
the
michigan
gyros
were
originally
included
as
coming
within
the
scope
of
the
patent
application
and
hints
the
agreement.
so,
an
interpretation
of
the
scope
of
the
patent
application
that
patent
are
very
basic
to
this
questions
that's
before
the
court
likewise,
whether
or
not
lear
has
the
right
to
challenge
the
validity
of
this
patent
raised
it
very
basic
federal
issues
before
this
court.
the
california
supreme
court
based
decisions
solely
under
the
terms
of
a
license
agreement
that
was
entered
into
between
the
parties
in
1955
and
the
california
supreme
court
felt
that
we're
not
concerned
with
defenses
which
might
be
available
to
lear
in
determining
questions
of
validity
and
infringement.
california
supreme
court
apparently
felt
that
the
agreement
was
supreme.
it
need
not
be
concerned
with
the
details
of
federal
law
that
control
patent
matters.
the
court
even
went
so
far
to
say
valid
claims
are
not
required.
but
we
submit
that
parties
should
--
it's
against
pubic
policy
for
parties
to
collaborate
and
export
patent
rights
regardless
of
validity.
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
if
lear
and
adkins
had
so
desired,
it
could've
join
forces,
paid
no
attention
to
whether
or
not
the
patent
was
valid
or
not
but
enforced
it
by
this
year
economic
power
and
that
public
interest
certainly
would
not
be
served
by
such
an
arrangement.
the
california
court
also
when
so
far
as
to
say
it
doesn't
matter
how
this
patent
was
obtained
to
the
patent
office,
patent
every
issues
below,
that's
all
we're
concerned
about.
we
don't
care
whether
new
matter
was
added
in
violation
of
the
federal
rules,
decisions
of
this
court
for
example.
the
california
court
said
we're
not
concerned
if
whether
or
not
fraud
has
practiced
on
the
patent
office.
we
submit
that
those
raise
very
basic
federal
issues
your
honor.
such
a
decision
results
in
extension
of
patent
rights
far
beyond
the
rights
that
would
be
available
in
an
infringement
action.
it
also
permits
individual
states
to
employ
standards
and
patent
matters
that
differ
from
state
to
state.
for
example,
as
matters
stand
today
the
law
in
california
concerning
licensee
estoppel
is
exactly
contra
to
the
law
in
the
state
of
michigan
knowing
the
state
of
minnesota
as
stated
by
the
minnesota
supreme
court
in
1954
in
the
case
of
crew
versus
flanagan
which
is
cited
in
our
briefs.
the
ultimate
result
of
the
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court
is
the
enforcement
of
the
patent
which
the
trial
court
in
california
found
to
be
invalid
as
a
matter
of
law
for
failure
to
meet
the
constitutional
standard
required
for
patentability.
we
submit
that
an
agreement
basing
a
decision
solely
upon
an
agreement
whereby
patent
rights
are
so
extended
is
against
public
policy,
against
the
policies
and
provisions
of
both
the
patent
laws
and
the
antitrust
laws.
if
an
agreement
can
be
employed
to
circumvent
the
constitutional
standard
required
for
patentability,
i.e.
uniform
federal
standards
cannot
be
maintained
in
the
50
states
and
this
is
sticking
example
of
one
state
that
is
out
of
step
with
some
other
states.
the
most
significant
dates
and
events
that
are
involved
in
this
case
are
set
forth
in
the
chart
that
i
have
behind
the
lectern
and
i
will
refer
to
these
dates
during
my
argument.
the
adkins'
patent
application
in
the
subject
matter
ensued
was
filed
in
february
of
1954.
the
agreement
was
entered
into
in
september
1955.
it
is
the
first
document
in
appendix
2
of
the
record
which
we
reproduce.
the
rights
and
the
obligations
of
the
parties
under
this
agreement
are
based
on
the
claims
are
set
forth
in
the
patent
application
which
was
filed
by
adkins
in
1954.
and
only
to
the
extent
that
the
claims
are
patentable,
the
agreement
is
very
explicit
in
this
regard.
lear
agreed
to
pay
royalties
on
its
products
that
employ
the
invention
that
is
defined
by
the
claims
that
are
patentable.
now
contrary
to
the
repeated
assertions
of
adkins
that
the
agreement
was
based
upon
the
secret
ideas
discoveries
and
unpatentable
things,
the
california
supreme
court
expressly
based
its
decision
on
adkins'
patent
rights
under
this
agreement.
for
example
in
appendix
1
at
page
192
the
california
supreme
court
said,
the
agreement
clearly
sets
forth
that
royalties
are
to
be
paid
only
for
patented
or
patentable
claims
which
lear
utilized
in
its
products.
now,
although
the
agreement
and
the
patent
applications
covered
several
devices
and
features
only
the
feature
of
bearing
alignment,
supporting
bearings
and
alignment
for
rotatable
devices
involved
in
this
action.
the
technical
subject
matter
is
almost
identical
with
that
which
is
before
this
court
many
years
ago
in
singer
versus
cramer
which
is
cited
in
our
briefs.
now,
the
patent
application
and
the
patent
which
is
ultimately
issued
are
also
reproduced
in
appendix
2
at
pages
18
and
32,
the
circumstances
under
which
this
dispute
arose
once
that
adkins
was
employed
by
lear
in
1951
under
an
agreement
which
permitted
him
to
retain
title
to
certain
inventions.
this
was
covered
by
a
preliminary
agreement
which
is
not
--
which
is
never
admitted
in
evidence
because
it
was
superseded
and
cancelled
by
the
1955
agreement
which
is
item
number
2
in
my
chart.
lear
had
two
facilities
that
at
that
time
one
was
in
california
and
the
other
one
was
in
michigan
and
adkins
did
his
work
in
the
california
facility
and
he
developed
along
with
other
lear
employees
this
model
2156
gyros.
at
the
same
time,
mr.
cureston
in
michigan
was
developing
the
so-called
michigan
gyro
and
in
1955,
lear
started
manufacturing
and
selling
both
of
these
devices
and
they
are
both
employed
in
military
equipment
almost
exclusively
in
military
equipment.
and
when
the
license
agreement
was
consummated,
the
patent
application
was
directed
primarily
to
the
way
the
devices
were
assembled.
and
as
i
mentioned
earlier
in
response
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
question,
the
two
products
were
included
as
covered
by
the
agreement
at
that
time
because
of
the
similarity
of
the
methods.
in
1957,
lear
conducted
a
search
of
prior
art
and
it
found
that
this
method
couldn't
be
patentable
to
adkins
that
call
the
prior
art
to
his
attention
and
at
that
time,
it
renounced
any
further
liability
on
the
michigan
steel
gyros,
that's
item
number
3.
now,
the
patent
application
was
rejected
several
times
and
amended
several
times
and
one
amendment
of
particular
importance
is
that
of
december
1958
prior
to
this
amendment,
the
application
was
directed
to
the
characteristic
features
of
the
model
2156
gyros.
subsequent
to
this
amendment,
it
was
directed
primary
that
the
characteristic
features
of
the
michigan
steel
gyros.
for
example,
prior
to
the
amendment
the
application
did
not
say
one
word
about
removable
bearings
yet
subsequent
to
the
amendment,
the
application
contains
such
wording
and
adkins
has
relied
very
heavily
on
that
added
wording
in
briefs
before
the
california
supreme
court
and
also
before
this
court
emphasizing
this
very
feature
that
was
added
by
amendment
many
years
later.
in
early
1959,
the
claims
directed
to
bearing
alignment
were
under
adjudging
by
the
patent
office,
all
of
them
were
under
adjudging.
the
application
have
been
pending
for
five
years,
lear
not
received
what
it
bargains
for
under
this
executory
contract
which
has
some
patent
rights.
so,
on
the
april
8,
1959
--
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
talking
about
the
entire
agreement
which
the
agreement
--
the
lear's
position
as
of
1959,
april
1959
was
that
we
have
stopped
paying
royalties
as
of
1957
because
--
mr.
c.
russell
hale
on
the
michigan
steel
gyros
but
they
continued
to
pay
royalties
on
the
california
gyros.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
well,
not
--
no,
your
honor.
as
of
this
day
--
mr.
c.
russell
hale
--
1955
the
two
products
were
listed
in
this
contract.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
as
of
this
day,
lear
said,
our
search
reveal,
you
cannot
possibly
get
the
claims
covering
the
process.
so,
we're
going
to
seize
paying
royalties.
we
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
c.
russell
hale
on
the
michigan.
we're
going
to
continue
on
the
california
model
2156
and
right
here
is
where
we
come
into
the
scope
question
of
enforcement
of
the
patent
under
state
laws,
your
honor.
as
of
this
day,
lear
said,
we
don't
seem
to
be
getting
anything.
we've
been
carrying
this
agreement
for
years,
no
patent
is
issued,
we
don't
think
it's
going
to
be
any
good
once
it
does
issue.
so,
we're
going
to
terminate
the
agreement
and
lear
served
the
notice
of
termination
--
mr.
c.
russell
hale
as
to
both.
as
to
the
whole
work,
your
honor.
under
expressed
provisions
of
the
agreement,
one
of
the
agreements
says,
lear
shall
have
the
right
on
90
days
prior
written
notice
to
terminate
any
of
the
licenses
in
this
agreement.
and
lear
said,
“all
right,
we
have
the
right,
we
terminate
the
whole
works.”
mr.
c.
russell
hale
no
your
honor,
that
provisions
appears
in
section
2
(a)
of
the
license
agreement,
it's
on
page
4.
if
i
may
direct
your
attention
to
the
specific,
it's
on
page
4
of
appendix
a
(2),
the
large
one.
section
paragraph
2
(a)
the
very
last
sentence,
it's
about
two-thirds
of
the
way
down
to
page.
it
says,
“lear
shall
have
the
right
on
90
days
prior
written
notice
to
adkins
to
terminate
any
one
or
more
of
the
licenses
herein
granted.”
mr.
c.
russell
hale
that's
--
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
well,
the
state
court
upon
considering
that
specific
pair
of
that
specific
sentence
said,
“we
find
an
implied
condition
that
requires
that
you
manufact
--
that
you
seize
manufacturing
these
devices
before
you
can
terminate.”
now,
this
did
not
arise
below
in
the
trial
level.
the
trial
court
said,
“the
agreement
is
--
was
terminated,
lear
exercised
its
rights.”
intermediate
appellate
court
said
the
same
thing.
california
supreme
court
found
this
implied
condition
and
it
is
our
position
your
honor
that
such
an
implied
condition
is
most
certainly
contrary
to
the
purposes
and
provisions
of
the
patent
and
antitrust
laws.
this
is
a
circumstance
that
arose
only
upon
the
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court.
so,
as
of
april
8,
1959,
it
was
lear's
position
that
the
entire
agreement
was
cancelled
which
covered
both
of
the
products.
now,
some
eight
or
nine
months
later
adkins
pushed
his
patent
through
the
patent
office,
they
issued
in
early
1960
and
the
complaint
was
filed
on
the
same
day.
the
complaint
searched
first
cause
of
action
asserting
breach
of
license
agreement
of
exhibit
8
and
unjust
arrangement
and
at
the
second
cause
of
action
misappropriation
of
adkins'
ideas
discovers
an
inventions
in
violation
of
his
common
law
rights.
now,
the
second
cause
of
action
was
dismissed
and
was
never
tried.
the
trial
court
took
and
ruled
that
lear
terminate
the
license
agreement
by
this
notice
in
1959
and
the
jury
returned
the
verdict
for
adkins
on
the
basis
of
both
products,
the
california
of
2156
and
the
michigan
steel
gyros.
the
trial
court
granted
lear's
motion
not
standing
the
verdict
concerning
the
michigan
steel
gyros
and
it
left
to
direct
the
verdict
concerning
a
california
gyros
stand.
trial
court
said
that
lear
has
not
stopped
to
contest
validity
with
respect
to
the
michigan
steel
gyros
because
they
were
independently
developed
also
because
the
claims
of
the
patent
do
no
cover
the
michigan
steel
gyros.
and
also
patent
is
invalid
or
as
that
trial
court
is
concerned
is
failing
to
meet
the
constitutional
standard
required
for
patentability
relying
upon
the
a&p
case
of
this
court.
well,
the
intermediate
appellate
court
of
california
ruled
generally
along
the
same
line.
i
won't
discuss
it
because
that
decision
has
rendered
a
nullity
of
when
the
california
supreme
court
takes
the
case.
california
supreme
court
held
that
this
termination
was
ineffective
because
of
this
implied
condition
that
we've
just
mentioned.
it
then
adopted
the
defense
of
licensee
estoppel
which
was
asserted
by
adkins
and
held
that
lear
was
estopped
to
contest
the
validity
of
the
patent
and
was
liable
for
royalties.
it
also
used
some
criteria
in
ascertaining
the
scope
of
the
invention
and
infringement
that
we
feel
are
clearly
in
violation
of
decision
of
this
court
for
example.
but
under
the
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court,
lear
has
two
alternatives.
one
is
to
pay
the
royalties
regardless
of
the
patent
invalidity
and
failure
consideration.
or
seize
manufacturing
the
devices,
it's
deprived
of
the
alternative
of
continuing
a
manufacture
of
the
products
purportedly
covered
by
the
claims
of
adkins'
patent
application
in
challenging
validity.
and
this
renders
any
licensee
that
challenges
validity
vulnerable
to
suit
of
infringement
and
imposition
of
damages
which
maybe
a
much
greater
magnitude
and
than
those
imposed
under
an
agreement.
so,
a
licensee
has
to
be
very
well
advised
before
he
wants
to
take
such
a
step.
well,
now,
the
issues
are
the
major
questions
before
this
court
are
--
mr.
c.
russell
hale
no
your
honor.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
well,
your
honor
you're
going
to
that
to
the
crux
of
one
of
the
issues
in
this
case
and
that
is
on
any
common
law
rights
involved
here
patents
and
common
law
the
rights
are
mutually
exclusive.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes
sir.
well,
your
honor
the
agreement
is
explicit.
and
this
agreement
superseded
cancelled
all
other
agreements.
lear
for
example,
wanted
to
go
in
to
things
of
that
nature
and
it
presented
and
exhibit
u
for
admission
and
evidence
under
an
offer
of
proof
at
reporter's
transcript
1018
where
adkins
says
in
representations
leading
up
to
the
license
agreement
is
impossible
for
me
to
give
lear
a
license
on
claims
which
may
not
be
allowed
or
are
not
patentable.
now,
evidence
along
as
this
line
was
excluded
by
the
trial
court,
the
trial
court
said,
“you're
under
this
agreement
and
this
agreement
limit
you
to
patented
or
patentable
things
and
not
secret
ideas,
not
discoveries,
nothing
unpatentable
is
covered.”
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
your
honor,
there
was
a
waiver
just
before
trial
of
all
causes
of
action
other
than
the
issues
raised
by
the
license
agreement.
so,
all
ideas
or
out
of
picture,
know-how
out
of
the
picture,
the
license
agreement
doesn't
mention
know-how
in
any
place
nor
does
it
mention
ideas.
the
only
thing
it
mentions
are
things
that
are
patented
or
patentable
and
hence,
we
submit
that
brings
that
directly
under
the
federal
criteria
concerning
patent
matters.
well,
the
major
questions
before
this
court
are
the
enforceability
of
such
an
agreement
containing
a
restraint
which
is
outside
the
scope
of
the
rights
provided
in
the
patent
laws.
number
2,
the
applicability
of
licensee
estoppel
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
and
as
the
general
principle
whether
the
claims
of
adkins'
patent
application
are
really
unpatentable
and
invalid
as
a
matter
of
law
like
the
superior
court
of
the
state
of
california
held.
and
there
is
question
number
4,
whether
the
ground
rules
in
enforcing
a
patent
under
a
license
agreement
are
the
same
as
they
are
in
enforcing
a
patent
in
an
infringement
action.
and
the
california
supreme
court
didn't
use
the
same
ground
rules.
otherwise,
they
could've
never
held
that
the
michigan
steel
gyros
are
covered
by
the
claims
of
the
patent.
well,
as
to
question
number
1,
enforceability
of
such
an
agreement,
the
requirement
that
lear
sees
manufacturing
the
products
covered
by
the
license
agreement
in
order
to
terminate
is
not
an
act
granted
by
the
patent
laws.
their
tendency
of
patent
application
provides
no
vested
rights
in
fact
the
patent
may
never
issue
and
this
we
submit
is
similar
to
the
situation
in
brulotte
versus
thys
where
this
court
held
that
an
agreement
which
attempts
to
extend
patent
rights
beyond
the
17-year
period,
patents
are
good
for
17
years
and
if
the
patent
is
attempted
to
be
extended
beyond
that
period,
it's
an
improper
use
of
patent
rights.
we
submit
that
the
very
same
considerations
apply
here
where
the
patent
rights
are
attempted
to
be
extended
before
they
really
issue.
we
submit
that
this,
such
a
provision
which
is
at
california
supreme
court
found
was
implied
in
the
agreement,
renders
it
unenforceable.
such
an
unwarranted
extension
of
patent
rights
is
particularly
objectionable
here
where
products
affected
are
military
equipment.
this
is
because
of
the
policy
embodied
in
28
u.s.c.
1498
which
permits
use
by
the
government
of
all
inventions
without
possibility
of
injunction.
it
also
safeguards
government
from
payment
of
royalties
on
species
patents
because
validity
can
always
be
attacked.
now,
with
reference
to
the
second
major
question
concerning
estoppel,
the
government
has
filed
a
brief
as
amicus
curiae
are
urging
that
this
court
should
complete
reject
any
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
and
advised
that
counsel
for
the
government,
mr.
wallace
will
direct
his
oral
argument
to
the
broad
grounds
and
accordingly
i
will
discuss
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
lear
specifically
renounced
any
liability.
it
renounced
liability
with
respect
to
the
michigan
steel
gyros
in
1957.
it
renounced
liability
under
the
whole
agreement
as
of
1959.
this
placed
adkins
in
the
position
that
he
could've
charged
lear
as
an
infringer
if
he
had
so
desired.
he
elected
to
bring
suit
for
royalties
and
he
relies
very
heavily
on
the
hazeltine
case
in
support
of
his
position.
when
the
hazeltine
case,
there
was
no
renouncement
of
the
license
agreement
prior
to
the
suit
against
hazeltine.
they
just
didn't
pay
royalties,
didn't
make
royalty
reports,
this
is
all
brought
out
in
the
lower
court
decisions.
under
the
hazeltine
case,
the
license
order
didn't
have
the
right
to
sue
for
infringement.
it
was
an
outstanding
agreement.
the
party
simply
had
not
paid
royalties.
here,
lear
has
renounced
and
adkins
had
a
choice.
he
chose
to
proceed
under
the
agreement
and
the
various
cases
cited
in
our
brief,
show
that
under
such
circumstances
where
there
is
a
renouncement,
assertion
of
pay
or
consideration,
lear
has
the
right
to
challenge
the
validity
of
that
patent.
the
dale
tile
company
case
is
his
one
along
this
line
and
--
mr.
c.
russell
hale
the
amount
of
the
judgment
on
the
california
model
2156
gyros
was
a
little
over
$16,000.00.
on
the
michigan
steel
gyros,
it
was
--
well,
it
was
almost
$900,000.00.
it
was
$888,000.00
i
believe.
now,
that
was
as
of
1963
your
honor
and
which
was
a
period
agreed
upon
for
accounting
purposes
only.
and
of
course
that
the
same
thing
applies
today,
it's
been
going
on
lear
is
doing
the
same
thing
today,
it
was
during
1963.
with
defense
of
failure
of
consideration
as
well
established
defense
in
contract
matters
and
that's
what
lear
asserted.
and
that's
a
defense
of
record
in
the
trial
court,
in
the
pleadings
and
we
submit
that
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
should
not
override
such
a
well-known
and
undisputed
defense.
second
circumstance
of
this
case
was
that
the
license
to
lear
was
granted
under
patent
application.
that
was
altered
by
amendment,
numerous
amendments
were
filed
in
this
application
and
as
i
pointed
out
one
of
major
importance
was
filed
in
december
1958
which
change
the
tender
of
face.
patent
issue
with
claims
lear
never
seen
it
invoked
the
rule
of
estoppel
under
such
circumstances
gives
the
license
order
of
a
patent
application
the
right
to
change
the
gist
of
his
invention,
covered
products
that
weren't
originally
considered
to
be
covered.
it
--
in
essence
places
the
licensee
at
the
mercy
of
the
licensor
with
no
mean
to
readdress.
now
we
submit
that
licensee
estoppel
should
not
apply
if
the
agreement
is
based
upon
a
patent
application
which
is
in
fact
changed
--
which
is
in
fact
amended
from
time
to
time
after
execution
of
the
agreement.
the
third
circumstance
of
this
case
is
that
the
--
has
i've
already
mentioned
the
license
agreement
as
construed
by
the
california
supreme
court
embodied
and
implied
condition
for
termination
that
requires
lear
to
seize
manufacturing
the
products
of
the
agreement
in
order
to
terminate
it.
as
this
court
held
in
macgregor
versus
westinghouse,
the
rule
of
licensee
estoppel
cannot
be
used
as
a
shield
to
preclude
investigation
of
the
validity
of
a
patent
where
in
the
absence
of
a
valid
patent
it
would
be
a
restraint
of
trade
and
certainly
that's
a
circumstance
here.
the
requirement
that
lear
seize
manufacturing
the
devices
as
a
restraint
a
trade
and
in
licensee
estoppel
should
not
be
implied
as
a
shield
to
prevent
lear
from
defenses
concerning
this
issue.
anyone
of
these
three
circumstances
is
sufficient
to
override
any
estoppel
if
an
adversity
job
of
the
doctrine
still
survives
and
mr.
wallace
will
discuss
that
on
behalf
of
the
government.
now,
lear's
third
and
fourth
questions
relate
to
the
validity
and
the
scope
of
adkins'
patent,
these
are
always
interrelated
because
the
patent
of
certain
scope
then
claims
must
not
read
on
the
prior
order
otherwise,
it's
rendered
invalid.
and
these
two
questions
require
an
understanding
of
the
bearing
supporting
apparatus
of
the
michigan
steel
gyros
and
that
california
model
2156
gyros
and
i
think
perhaps
this
will
help
clarify
some
of
the
questions
that
mr.
justice
fortas
was
raising
earlier.
the
alignment
arrangements
if
i
may
ask
the
court
to
refer
to
figure
9
of
lear's
reply
brief
at
page
50.
the
two
alignment
arrangements
are
shown
there
in
simplified
form.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
lear's
reply
brief
your
honor.
it's
the
gray
covered,
very
small
brief
towards
the
end
at
page
50.
you
will
find
two
figures
illustrating
adkins'
patent
and
one
figure
illustrating
the
michigan
steel
gyro.
now,
adkins'
patent
shows
a
bearing
supporting
apparatus
which
implies
a
cone-shaped
seat
in
a
gimbal
housing
and
spherical
shape
bearing
couch.
and
the
patent
states
that
those
elements
are
shown
at
both
the
top
and
bottom
of
the
figures
concerning
adkins's
patent
and
i
will
elaborate
on
that
little
more
in
the
moment.
the
patent
states,
the
bearings
may
be
aligned
by
placing
them
on
a
jig
or
mandrel
and
then
placing
them
in
the
bearing
or
seeding
elements
as
we've
illustrate.
when
the
mandrel
is
rotated,
it
causes
the
bearings
to
become
align
and
this
is
accommodated
by
the
engaging
surfaces
between
the
cylindrical
shape
bearing
cups
in
the
cone-shaped
seats,
in
view
of
their
different
curved
shapes.
i'm
purporting
more
or
less
from
the
patent
i
believe
exactly
from
it.
now
at
the
trial,
we
use
this
demonstration
to
illustrate
the
two
types
of
services
we're
talking
about
the
cone-shaped
seat
are
the
two
seats
in
the
framework
that's
shown
on
figure
9
and
the
segment
--
the
other
members
are
spherical
shape,
they're
portion
of
spear
and
we've
illustrated
this
by
a
piece
of
a
croquet
ball.
this
shows
the
type
of
action
that
adkins
used
in
order
to
achieve
alignment.
it
provides
angular
and
the
so-called
angular
tilt
that
you'll
see
referred
to
in
the
briefs
due
to
the
two
surfaces
that
are
involved
that
accommodate
this
kind
of
movement.
now,
we
have
a
model
here
in
court
showing
the
alignment
of
the
bearings
and
accordance
with
adkins'
patent,
this
was
demonstrated
at
the
trial
and
i
think
it's
essential
if
the
court
will
bear
with
me.
i
believe
it's
essential
for
thorough
understanding
of
the
issue
of
scope
--
scope
of
the
patent,
definite
patent
and
patent
application
that
are
involved
in
this
action.
so,
mr.
hartz
will
demonstrate
this
model,
it's
approximately
four
times
the
actual
size
of
the
actual
parts
in
reality.
it
shows
a
cone-shaped
seat
like
the
paddle
that
i
just
demonstrated.
it
has
bearing
caps
with
a
spherical
surface.
this
is
the
spherical
surface
much
like
the
croquet
ball
and
that
i
demonstrated.
it
has
bearings
for
mounting
in
the
bearing
caps
which
ultimately
go
into
the
seats
which
in
the
framework.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
this
is
the
left
hand
portion
adkins'
patent.
adkins'
patent
and
the
21
--
the
california
model
2156
gyro
was
very
similar
your
honor.
as
the
cone-shaped
member
here,
the
spherical
shape
member
here
or
receiving
bearing
element
there,
this
is
very
much
like
the
top
thing
that
shown
on
the
first
one
as
you
can
see
it
and
there's
a
small
cut
away
there.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
now,
the
patent
says
these
bearings
are
sled
on
a
jig
or
mandrel
which
may
be
a
cylindrical
rod.
this
jig
or
mandrel
simply
an
assembly
to
which
is
taken
after
later
and
we
will
demonstrate
that.
the
bearings
are
then
placed
into
the
bearing
caps
and
then
they
in
turn
of
course
were
in
the
framework
in
their
cone-shaped
seats.
the
mandrel
is
rotated
and
due
to
the
nature
of
the
engaging
surfaces
which
permit
this
type
of
movement
alignment
is
achieved.
as
soon
as
that's
done,
some
of
it
is
placed
around
there
to
hold
them
in
place.
the
patent
states
that
other
arrangements
can
be
used
like
screws
or
welding
what
have
you.
thereafter,
the
jig
is
removed
then
the
gyro
is
then
ready
to
put
together
in
final
form.
now,
the
alignment
of
the
michigan
steel
gyros
is
illustrated
in
the
right
--
corner
right
hand
corner
of
figure
9
and
we
will
now
demonstrate
that.
here
is
the
jig
which
appears
in
the
center
of
figure
9.
this
is
taken
from
exhibit
o
and
it
was
admitted
in
evidence
and
is
part
of
the
assembly
procedure
that's
been
throughout
this
trial.
here's
the
little
mandrel
or
jig
as
actually
employed
in
production
in
the
michigan
steel
gyro.
you
will
notice
that
one
end
has
a
little
bearing
cap
on
it
and
the
other
hand
i
will
put
one
on
right
now.
this
fits
snuggly
and
not
only
that
but
they
are
fixed
by
a
screws
and
washers
so
that
they
are
absolutely
rigid
those
bearing
caps
when
there
are
mounted
on
this.
and
they
are
now
in
alignment
right
now
no
matter
what
you
do
with
them.
those
bearing
caps
are
in
the
alignment
and
will
stay
that
way.
no
angular
motion,
no
tilt,
bearing
alignment.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
the
mandrel
is
this
portion
here
your
honor
and
here
are
the
two
bearing
caps.
we
have
a
larger
model
little
piece
here
for
the
court
to
see.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes,
your
honor
and
these
terms
have
all
been
used
interchangeably.
i
feel
compelled
to
use
them,
more
or
less
interchangeably.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes,
your
honor.
now,
here's
the
characteristic
structure
of
the
bearing
caps
in
the
michigan
steel
gyros.
it's
a
total
--
the
total
thing
has
been
sometimes
characterizes
as
a
cylindrical
top
cap
placed
in
a
loose
hole,
loosely
fitting
hole.
and
here,
it's
loose.
i'm
going
to
assemble
that
and
show
the
court
just
exactly
how
the
alignment
is
achieved.
again,
this
is
approximately
four
times
scale.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
this
is
four
times
--
mr.
c.
russell
hale
for
the
benefit
--
mr.
c.
russell
hale
actual.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
no
sir,
your
honor
we
have
here
in
court
the
actual
housings
that
those
--
that
the
mandrel
goes
into
if
i
may
demonstrate
the
--
it
goes
into
a
loose
hole
on
this
end,
the
loose
hole
on
this
end.
the
thing
is
submitted
in
place
or
well
that
what
have
you
and
then
the
mandrel
can
be
removed.
it's
ready
for
final
assembly
and
here
are
the
packages
as
ready.
if
you'll
--
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes,
your
honor
that's
right
out
the
production.
for
the
characteristic
of
alignment
in
the
michigan
steel
gyros
still
uses
a
mandrel
like
the
california
model
2156
but
that
that's
about
the
end
of
the
resemblance
and
that
mandrel
is
taken
out
not
used
--
adkins
tried
to
get
claims
covering
the
procedure
for
alignment.
the
way
i
just
demonstrated
on
the
model
2156,
he
tried
and
tried
and
tried
and
he
was
turned
down
every
time
on
his
method
claims
and
they
cancelled
those.
we
submit
that
puts
him
in
the
public
domain
and
he
cannot
now
claim
that
the
method
is
the
same
to
employ
the
same
thing.
california
supreme
court
said
it
wasn't
obligated
to
look
at
the
file
history
concerning
these
aspects
because
the
claims
that
were
presented
in
that
application
were
brand
new.
it
represented
down
to
very
end
of
the
prosecution.
well,
we
submit
that
that's
not
the
law,
the
criteria
that's
been
established
by
this
court
and
many
other
court
say
you
have
to
look
at
the
whole
file
history
in
order
to
ascertain
what
the
claim
really
mean.
the
california
supreme
court
actually
--
well,
in
interpreting
the
scope
of
adkins'
patent,
the
california
supreme
court
said,
“the
device
of
submitted
in
bearing
caps
using
a
mandrel
procedure
constitutes
the
essence
of
adkins'
invention
as
described
in
his
application.”
well,
that's
the
essence
of
his
invention,
it's
in
the
public
domain
because
he
cancelled
that
the
method
in
a
mandrel
procedure,
the
language
i've
just
quoted
from
is
in
appendix
(a)
(1)
(192).
now,
this
is
one
of
the
criteria
that
we
feel
that
the
california
supreme
court
applied
in
improperly.
and
other
major
thing
was
that
the
california
supreme
court
states
that
alignment
of
bearing
caps
in
either
adkins
or
the
steel
gyros
can
be
accomplished
only
by
the
angular
displacement
of
the
two
caps
to
the
access
of
the
mandrel.
well,
if
it
please
the
court,
it's
impossible
for
either
these
two
caps
to
be
displaced
to
the
access
of
the
mandrel.
it's
an
absolute
physical
impossibility
and
we
submit
that
that's
a
major
error.
if
i
may
indulge
the
court,
i
would
like
to
refer
now
to
our
opening
brief.
i
believe
that's
blue
at
figure
4
which
is
opposite
page
57.
this
figure
4-2
sets
forth
the
main
claim
of
adkins'
patent
application
and
the
patent
which
issued
which
illustrated
here.
i
will
refer
to
the
figures
since
the
print
is
a
little
small
here
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
letters
a,
b
and
c
identify
the
three
elements
of
this
invention
and
adkins
admits
that
those
three
elements
are
old,
old
in
the
art.
he
simply
says,
they
have
a
new
cooperative
relationship
but
when
he
applies
his
new
cooperative
relationship
he
didn't
talking
about
things
in
the
claim.
and
it's
the
claim
that
defines
the
invention.
now,
this
is
one
of
the
exhibits
employed
in
the
trial
court,
and
i
use
it
only
for
the
purpose
of
illustration.
it's
the
left
hand
figure
of
exhibit
4-1
and
i
just
referred
the
court
to.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
color
code
on
all
of
these
things
is
the
same,
red
means
bearing
caps
and
so
forth.
and
you'll
see
here
a
red
element
of
bearing
cap
designated
a,
a
bearing
proceeding
frame
b,
and
means
for
holding
that
bearing
cap
in
place
designated
c.
now,
the
bearing
receiving
element
is
in
a
sloppy
hole
and
loosely
fitting
hole
just
like
the
michigan
steel
gyros.
and
alignment
is
achieved
by
use
of
this
feature.
now,
i
will
rely
--
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes
your
honor.
this
goes
to
the
issue
of
validity
and
scope
if
adkins'
claims
read
on
this
michigan
steel
gyros
i
just
demonstrated.
they
also
read
right
on
this
--
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes
your
honor
and
also
on
several
others
and
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice
i
believe
i
have
about
five
minutes
left,
i'd
like
to
reserve
it.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
morning
we
spent
a
lot
of
time
on
something
that
we
had
no
trial
on.
the
trial
court
limited
us
to
the
express
terms
of
this
license
agreement.
we
--
pardon
me.
we
endeavor
to
present
evidence
leading
up
to
the
consummation
of
this
agreement,
a
background
material,
the
trial
court
excluded,
expressly
excluded
all
of
that.
the
trial
court
said,
you're
here
on
an
agreement
or
you're
here
on
something
else,
why
are
you
here
on?
it
required
adkins
to
elect.
adkins
wanted
to
go
in
under
the
idea,
discovery,
invention
and
common
law.
the
trial
court
says,
you
can't
ride
both
those
horses.
you
have
to
pick
the
agreement
or
the
common
law,
which
are
you
on?
and
adkins
picked
the
agreement.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
i
think
it
was
your
honor.
the
two
causes
of
action
are
antagonistic
to
one
another,
they
are
i
might
say
mutually
exclusive
as
i
indicated
yesterday
the
common
law
relies
upon
secrecy,
nondisclosure.
patent
law
relies
upon
disclosure.
there
was
an
agreement,
adkins
pleaded
the
agreement
and
that's
what
we're
here
on.
now,
for
example
this
--
mr.
c.
russell
hale
sir?
mr.
c.
russell
hale
no,
i
thought
i'm
in
complete
agreement
with
the
court's
decision
and
that
has
not
been
overturned
your
honor.
that
was
the
way
the
thing
went
up
all
the
way.
now,
this
is
enabled
the
presentation
of
numerous
incorrect
statements
as
to
the
facts
because
they're
just
not
in
the
record.
now
a
lot
of
the
facts,
of
this
court
heard
this
morning,
are
not
in
the
record
because
the
trial
court
won't
let
us
put
them
in
the
record.
for
example,
today,
you
heard
that
adkins
alone
negotiated
with
lear
and
this
is
set
forth
in
adkins'
brief
at
page
15,
he
gives
a
couple
of
reporters
transcripts
citations
and
i
ask
this
court
to
read
those
two
citations
and
see
if
adkins
was
represented
by
counsel
or
not.
they
don't
say.
now,
at
the
trial,
we
tried
to
present
evidence
concerning
this
as
i
pointed
out
and
it
was
excluded.
exhibit
u
is
down
in
the
record,
in
the
archives.
we
made
an
offer
of
proof
of
exhibit
u
at
our
--
at
the
reporter's
transcript
1018.
exhibit
u
says,
i
have
read
over
the
license
agreement
and
i
found
it
to
be
generally
in
good
shape.
however,
prior
to
submitting
it
to
my
lawyer
for
his
comments
and
interpretation
of
certain
legal
phraseology
i
would
like
to
go
into
certain
details.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
this
was
exhibit
u
presented
by
lear,
it
was
not
admitted
because
the
trial
court
says,
i'm
not
going
to
let
you
go
into
the
details
of
this
agreement.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
oh!
pardon
me
your
honor.
this
is
written
by
adkins
to
mr.
bloomberg
who
was
a
lawyer
for
lear.
so,
this
was
a
communication
by
john
adkins
concerning
the
license
agreement
directed
to
lear
and
it
says
prior
to
submit
again.
now,
adkins
is
saying,
prior
to
submitting
it
to
my
lawyer
for
his
comments.
now,
this
is
dated
november
26,
1954.
there
are
several
other
pieces
of
--
this
is
not
an
evidence
your
honor,
this
was
for
identification
only
but
it
is
down
here
in
this
--
in
the
archives
and
i
just
want
to
point
out
that
this
one
of
the
things
that
we've
been
going
into
today
that
that
we
never
had
trial
on.
i
don't
consider
this
part
of
the
record.
i
considered
it
improper
for
adkins
to
say
he
wasn't
represented
by
legal
counsel
when
things
that
were
excluded
from
the
evidence
show
that
he
was.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
that
is
correct
your
honor.
but
it
was
stated
as
a
fact
this
morning
that's
why
i'm
bringing
it
up.
now,
another
point
i
would
like
to
discuss
is
--
mr.
c.
russell
hale
you'll
find
nothing
in
the
record
that
clarifies
that
for
the
court
and
i
simply
feel.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes.
well,
your
honor
we
were
not
permitted
to
go
into
that.
there
simply
no
record
on
it.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
well,
i
have
some
idea
but
i
don't
believe
it's
proper
for
me
to
tell
the
court
my
ideas.
i
think
we're
here
on
the
record.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
well,
i
gave
you
this
as
an
example
to
show
we're
discussing
things
this
morning
that
aren't
before
the
court.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
alright.
your
honor,
adkins
was
an
employee
of
lear.
he
would
go
to
lear
from
time
to
time
and
discuss
this.
there
wasn't
any
hurry
about
this
agreement.
they
were
negotiating
it
arguing
back
and
forth
and
this
was
a
very
leisurely
thing.
he
dropped
in
and
chat
about
it
and
go
away
and
say,
i'll
talk
to
my
lawyer
about
it.
three
months
later,
he'd
come
back
and
say
something
else
and
it
was
just
that
sort
of
thing.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes,
your
honor.
now,
another
thing
much
of
the
argument
today
has
been
based
upon
the
discussion
of
these
idea,
discoveries,
and
inventions
apart
from
patent
rights.
well,
again,
the
record
shows
that
this
issue
was
eliminated
at
the
outset
of
this
action
and
no
evidence
was
permitted
on
this.
we're
talking
about
things
that
we
don't
have
the
record
on.
we
simply
we're
not
permitted
to
go
in
to
this
sort
of
thing.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
no
sir,
your
honor
it
has
the
same
status
in
the
record
as
this
document
i've
just
read
it
to
the
court.
the
one
page
agreement
is
reprinted
as
the
very
last
document
in
the
big
appendix.
it
was
never
admitted.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
mr.
adkins
designated
for
inclusion
in
the
record
if
you
will
notice
we
say
exhibit
7
for
identification
only.
this
document
was
never
admitted
and
the
reason
it
was
never
admitted
is
the
trial
court
said,
we're
going
to
trial
on
the
agreement
of
exhibit
8
and
nothing
else
is
material,
nothing
else
is
permitted.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes,
your
honor.
we
were
never
permitted
to
develop
a
record
of
any
kind
going
--
leading
of
the
thing
--
leading
up
to
the
consummation
of
this
agreement.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
that's
--
mr.
c.
russell
hale
i
think
we're
both
referring
to
the
same
thing
your
honor
--
mr.
c.
russell
hale
would
you
so
agree
mr.
cohen
that
we're
referring
–
he's
referring
to
the
pleadings
and
i'm
referring
to
the
exhibits.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
no,
that's
beyond
question
your
honor
but
the
trial
court
excluded
it
because
license
agreement,
paragraph
13
of
the
license
agreement
says,
this
agreement
supersedes
and
cancels
the
agreement
which
has
been
brought.
mr.
c.
russell
hale
thank
you
your
honor.
