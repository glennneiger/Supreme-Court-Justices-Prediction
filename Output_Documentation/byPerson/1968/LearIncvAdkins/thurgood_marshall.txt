mr.
cohen,
do
you
see
any
difference
if
this
contract
it
terminated
at
the
issuance
of
the
patent
with
instruction
to
renegotiate
or
the
one
you
have
here
which
continues
after
the
patent
issue?
do
you
see
any
difference
in
those
two
contracts?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
the
reason
i
mentioned
it
is
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
i
think
it
is
some
significance
that
this
runs
pass
the
patent
and
you
say
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
patent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
guess
the
patent
is
just
incidental.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
i
assume
you
giving
us
a
job
of
finding
out
how
far
patent
is
involved
in
the
agreement?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
it
is
involved
to
a
certain
degree
then
you're
in
trouble
and
we
are
left
with
the
job
of
finding
out
how
far
it
is
involved,
is
that
what
you're
doing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
no
more?
