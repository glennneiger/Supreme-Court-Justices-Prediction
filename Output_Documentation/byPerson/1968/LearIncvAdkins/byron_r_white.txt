justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
issued
necessarily
decided
in
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
it
is
necessarily
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
unavoidably?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
california
supreme
court
for
instance
decision
on
lear's
ability
to
count
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
you
--
what
about
--
what
if
lear
was
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
true
that
both
of
the
--
that
no
royalties
were
payable
except
on
patented
or
patentable
articles
under
this
agreement?
justice
byron
r.
white
volume
1?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
one,
that's
what
you
read
before?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
makes
you
think
that
the
court
below
decided
on
state
grounds?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
makes
them
decide?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
said
that
ruling
--
i
mean
you
said
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
the
cases
decided
that
walker
cites?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
for
the
moment
(inaudible),
we
have
to
assume
the
probability
of
(inaudible).
now
with
a
question
like
this
of
federal
government,
were
we
just
supposed
to
assume
that
the
state
court
didn't
know
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
federal
law
that
govern
this
is
whether
or
not
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
state
court
said,
licensee
estoppel
applies
in
this
situation
must
be
complied
that
within
the
federal
doctrine
the
internal
rule
applies
in
the
situation?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it's
only
a
question
of
whether
the
state
law
will
apply
because
of
federal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
yes
but
didn't
the
license
agreement
just
cover
patented
or
patentable
device?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
just
ignore
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
nobody
have
to
determine
then,
doesn't
somebody
before
lear
is
liable
have
to
determine
that
these
devices
were
either
patented
or
patentable?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
that
lear
--
do
you
say
that
by
doing
that
lear
may
be
force
to
pay
even
though
it's
determined
that
none
of
the
devices
are
patentable?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
it's
certainly
included
the
right
of
use
whatever
it
disclose?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
anticipated
the
patent
and
certainly
there
was
a
patent
in
this
case
the
damage
accrued
might
be
february
5,
1960.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
the
contract
--
and
the
question
to
this
is
going
to
relate
it
to
federal
patent?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
that
this
contract
could've
been
included
the
promise
by
lear
to
use
in
connection
with
this
disclose
the
device,
some
other
device
that
the
seller
wanted
lear
to
use?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
--
would
the
contract
be
valid
just
because
of
it
was
valid
under
state
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
you
can
tie
something
to
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
because
there's
some
federal
law
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
is
that
california
court
was
reporting
to
follow
federal
law
you
would
be
saying
that
they
would've
come
up
with
the
same
result?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
they
can
on
the
patent
--
on
license
estoppel,
don't
you
think
they
would've
come
up
for
the
same
result?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
not
--
you
don't
argue
that
the
cases
in
this
court
recognize
license
estoppel?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
if
the
federal
--
if
the
supreme
court
of
california
then
purporting
to
follow
up
federal

would
it
not
the
