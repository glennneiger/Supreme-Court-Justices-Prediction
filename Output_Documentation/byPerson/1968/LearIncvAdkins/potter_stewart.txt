mr.
hale,
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
the
relationship
between
what's
being
demonstrated
here
and
the
diagrams
of
page
50
of
the
reply
brief.
is
this
the
--
what
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
where
is
the
mandrel?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what's
an
arbor,
is
that
the
same
with
the
mandrel?
justice
potter
stewart
mandrel
or
arbor
or
jig,
all
three
mean
the
same
thing?
justice
potter
stewart
and
where
is
that
--
is
that
actual
scale,
the
actual
four
--
justice
potter
stewart
four
times.
justice
potter
stewart
in
his
right
hand
is
the?
justice
potter
stewart
actual.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
the
actual
size
that
you
have
in
your
hand?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
is
what
prior
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
on
this
one
patent
which
is
prior?
justice
potter
stewart
do
we
have
that
in
these
papers
that
we
have
including
the
appendix
or
anywhere?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
we
do
not
have
that
in
all
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
there's
no
question
and
i
gather
that
the
supreme
court,
the
state
court
did
rely
on
the
estoppel
to
dispose
of
this
case
to
some
extent.
justice
potter
stewart
and
your
point
is
that
no
one
ever
really
raised
the
question
of
whether
federal
law
forbade
the
state
court
to
rule
that
way?
justice
potter
stewart
what
about
the
passage
in
the
brief
that
was
read
to
us
yesterday?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
that?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
cohen,
was
he
--
was
mr.
adkins,
as
i
understood
it
from
the
brief,
he
was
not
represented
by
counsel
in
the
drafting
of
that
1951
letter
agreement,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
in
the
negotiations
that
led
up
to
the
agreement
that's
an
issue
here?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
understood
you
to
say
in
the
brief
then
i
saw
in
the
california
supreme
court's
opinion
that's
different
implication.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
telling
us
that
this
was
more
analogous
to
simple
compensation
for
his
services
to
the
company,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
his
compensation
for
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
services
that
he
contributed
for
the
company
which
proved
to
be
well
worth
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
there
--
if
they
want
a
provision
in
the
agreement
with
respect
to
termination
if
the
patent
is
held
invalid?
there
weren't
any
provision
like
that
at
all.
you
could
argue
i
suppose
that
it's
totally
irrelevant
where
the
patent
is
valid
or
invalid
and
that
even
if
the
patent
was
declared
invalid
this
--
the
obligation
of
the
license
goes
on.
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
contracted
for
the
use
of
the
process
why
you
contract
for
the
use
of
it,
was
it
patent
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
but
now,
you
do
have
a
provision
in
the
contract
that
says
termination
if
it's
held
invalid?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
the
license
agreement
seems
to
me
does
have
some
critical
part
of
it
but
depended
upon
the
existence
of
the
patent?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
on
page
11
of
appendix,
volume
1
and
it
is
exhibit
1
to
the
complaint
that
was
filed
and
as
i
understand
it
the
answer
did
not
deny
that
part
of
the
allegations
of
the
complaint?
justice
potter
stewart
