justice
abe
fortas
well,
does
the
so-called
michigan
--
does
the
so-called
michigan
patent
here
really
--
michigan
device
really
involved
a
question
under
the
patent
law?
justice
abe
fortas
as
distinguished
from
the
california,
i
think
i've
got
it
straightened.
the
michigan
device
up
to
during
the
--
up
to
the
time
of
term
notice
of
termination
any
way
was
not
patented,
was
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
was
it
patented
on
--
up
through
the
stipulated
time
or
the
cut
off
or
purposes,
cut
off
on
damages
for
purposes
of
this
litigation?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
that
was
the
so-called
california?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
talking
all
about
michigan
which
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
last
legs
on
someone,
i
don't
want
to
anticipate
your
argument
(voice
overlap).
justice
abe
fortas
don't
bother
to
answer
me
now
but
as
you
go
along,
i
trust
you
will.
justice
abe
fortas
i
brought
it
up
at
this
time
because
the
nature
of
your
opening
statement
but
it's
bothered
me
since
i
first
studied
this
case
whether
in
the
extent
to
which
this
is
truly
a
question
involving
the
patent
laws
of
the
united
states
or
whether
at
least
so
far
as
the
michigan
patent
is
concerned,
it's
a
contract
question
perhaps
under
antitrust
laws
generally.
i
don't
want
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
to
interfere
with
your
plain
argument
but
i
--
that
is
the
basic
problem
in
my
mind
in
this
case.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
that
--
are
you
talking
now
about
both
of
them?
justice
abe
fortas
on
what?
justice
abe
fortas
so,
i
just
have
a
greatest
difficulty
in
this
case
when
you
talk
about
both
of
them
together
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
because
i
understand
what
i've
read
in
the
briefs,
there
are
differences
in
fact
that
maybe
material
in
a
way
with
respect
to
california
and
michigan.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
that
charge
you
got
up
there
relates
only
to
michigan,
does
it?
justice
abe
fortas
yes
that
the
license
--
justice
abe
fortas
right.
justice
abe
fortas
on
michigan?
justice
abe
fortas
as
to
both.
as
to
both?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
right
as
to
terminate
was
that
confined
to
situation
in
which
patent
did
not
issue?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
don't
you
have
to
treat
the
michigan
steel
gyro
problem
as
license
to
use
know-how
or
none
patent
that
i
recall
--
justice
abe
fortas
how
do
you
--
why
do
you
talk
about
that
one
in
the
terms
of
patent
law?
that's
a
question
i
put
to
you
initially
and
it's
still
bothers
me.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at.
justice
abe
fortas
because
i
really
don't
understand
it
and
i
couldn't
--
i
just
entangle
it
from
your
brief.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
assuming
that
the
michigan
patent
here
is
invalid
and
assuming
that
petitioner
can
avail
itself
of
that
point,
is
that
in
your
judgment
dispose
of
the
claim
with
respect
to
compensation
for
the
use
of
the
michigan
device?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
your
--
you're
doing
something
more
than
asking
us
to
make
a
ruling
in
the
abstract,
aren't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
about
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
there's
no
question
about
the
california,
validity
of
the
california
patent,
is
there
in
this
case?
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
judgment
as
have
been
in
adjudication
that
the
michigan
patent
is
invalid
in
this
case
there
hasn't,
has
it?
justice
abe
fortas
but
there
was
such
an
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
there
was
an
adjudication
--
wasn't
there
an
adjudication,
was
it
in
the
intermediate
court?
justice
abe
fortas
invalid
at
the
trial
court.
so,
that
we
do
have
that
difference
in
the
posture
of
the
case
in
any
event
between
these
two
patents
and
you,
you
made
no
study
of
the
impact
of
accepting
your
theory
with
respect
to
whether
a
claim
survives?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
have
made
a
study
that's
helpful
to
us.
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
wouldn't
certainly
preclude
us,
would
it?
assuming
that
they
have
not
press
the
point
below
would
that
wouldn't
preclude
us
from
deciding
the
issue,
would
it?
this
is
not
an
issue
that
this
is
about
us
claiming
the
issue
of
law,
law
appearing
something
is
any
such
thing
as
one
could
readily
imagine.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
don't
want
to
take
more
of
your
time
but
certainly
there
were
plenty
of
federal
questions
raised
below
and
your
point,
i
take
it
is
that
assuming
that
this
particular
argument
was
not
made
below.
is
it
too
late
to
make
this
particular
argument
here?
justice
abe
fortas
you
said
if
i
understood
you
that
the
estoppel
claim
the
estoppel
of
the
patentee
related
only
the
part
of
the
issues
in
this
case,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
will
you
tell
us
about
that
sometime
in
the
course
of
your
argument.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
agree
or
disagree
that
this
contract
has
to
be
construed
and
applied
solely
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
patent
--
of
a
patent
contract
--
patent
license
contract?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
difficulty
i
have
with
your
argument
perhaps
is
what
is
really
going
on
here
is
that
you
seem
to
have
a
contract
here
that
depends
upon
the
patent
law
and
the
special
rights
flowing
from
patent
and
i
think
it's
under
the
patent
and
then
you,
you
hear
this
on
what
i've
been
trying
to
get
at
then
you
come
here
and
seems
to
me
in
what
you're
saying
at
least
in
large
part
is
that
even
if
the
patent
is
invalid
you're
still
entitled
to
those
same
rights
on
a
contract
basis
without
reference
to
the
patent.
that's
kind
of
a
heads
you
win
tails,
the
other
side
loses
or
tails
of
patent
system
loses.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
what
i'm
trying
--
you're
saying
this
certainly
looks
like
a
patent
agreement.
it
does
--
got
all
the
terminology
of
a
patent
agreement
with
respect
to
the
exhibit
c
rights
it's
â€“-
purports
to
give
the
other
party
and
exclusive
right
to
the
use
of
it,
it
smells
like
a
patent
agreement.
and
as
i
understand
it
what
you
say
here
is
that
even
if
the
patent
aspects
unlawful
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
you
can
resort
to
state
contract
law
and
still
collect
the
same
amounts
of
money
and
certain
practically
the
same
rights.
justice
abe
fortas
maybe
i
misunderstand
you
but
that's
what
i've
been
trying
to
get
at
in
my
questions
here
to
see
whether
that
is
in
fact
that
they
are
in
now
based
on
your
colloquy
with
justice
douglas.
it
seems
to
me
that
indeed
that
is
your
theory.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
it's
peculiarly
drafted
contracted
in
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
cohen,
in
what
respect
what
can
you
point
to
in
this
contract
that
distinguishes
it
really
from
the
ordinary
sort
of
contract
in
some
of
the
circumstances
where
a
party
has
an
item
for
which
he
has
filed
the
patent
application
and
he
makes
contract
with
somebody
else
for
the
use
of
that
item.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
your
case
and
perhaps
the
decision
of
the
california
court
depend
upon
your
argument
rather
than
the
decision
of
california
court
depend
upon
establishing
that
a
fundamental
proposition
which
goes
to
the
intention
of
the
parties
which
is
that
somehow
someway
this
is
not
to
be
looked
at
as
an
ordinary
agreement
with
respect
to
an
article
before
which
patent
application
has
been
filed
and
which
is
subject
to
the
federal
patent
law
but
somehow
someway
this
contract
is
to
be
read
in
terms
of
the
intention
of
the
parties
and
then
as
an
agreement
for
the
use
of
any
an
invention
without
reference
to
patentability.
certainly,
the
contract,
when
you
look
at
the
contract
it
looks
like
an
ordinary
patent
--
ordinary
agreement
under
the
patent
laws.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
it
was
too
bad,
wouldn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
not
yet?
justice
abe
fortas
alternatively
then
i
think
i
have
some
illumination
that
really
what
you're
urging
upon
us
is
that
we
construe
the
patent
license
agreement
which
is
the
agreement
upon
which
this
litigation
has
been
conducted
as
if
that
incorporated
the
spirit
and
substance
and
motivation
of
the
--
and
they
show
one
page
agreement
between
adkins
and
lear.
that's
about
what
it
comes
down
to.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
what
i
haven't
got
is
and
perhaps
it's
in
the
brief
and
i
don't
want
to
divert
your
argument
and
i
don't
recall
it
in
your
brief.
what
i
haven't
got
is
what
is
there
in
this
agreement
in
the
what
i
call
a
license
agreement
that
enables
us
to
disregard
the
fact
that
it's
patent
license
agreement?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
would
cut
pretty
far
one
because
practically
every
patent
license
agreement
involves
the
same
kind
of
--
involves
a
licensee
of
know-how
and
i
suppose
there
are
great
many
that
involved
facts
somewhat
like
this
in
terms
of
the
background
of
the
patent
license
agreement
itself
which
you
really
--
it's
possible
that
the
argument
is
that
an
invitation
to
this
court
to
supersede
some
aspect
that
at
least
the
federal
patent
law
where
the
parties
had
a
relationship
of
employer
or
employee
during
the
period
of
invention.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
the
motion
on
appeal
of
the
case.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
did
you
say
that
mr.
adkins
was
not
represented
by
counsel
in
drafting
of
this
agreement?
justice
abe
fortas
well
that,
that
point
is
contested
by
lear?
justice
abe
fortas
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
they
say
that
claim
9
does
not
cover
the
michigan
steel
gyros?
justice
abe
fortas
when
they
say
that
there
was
--
that
there's
no
evidence
to
support
the
jury's
verdict?
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
they
say?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
california
supreme
court
reinstated
the
jury
verdict?
justice
abe
fortas
--
on
this?
justice
abe
fortas
where
the
special
findings,
special
verdict
by
the
jury?
justice
abe
fortas
but
there
were
--
are
the
instructions
challenged?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
we
hold
in
this
case
that
there
is
no
showing
of
abuse,
patent
abuse
and
suppose
we
reiterate
what
you
assert
to
be
the
doctrine
of
that
the
licensee
having
agreed
i
take
it
that
it
will
not
attack
the
validity
of
the
patent
in
the
circumstances.
suppose
we
reiterate
that
it
is
estopped
from
attacking
it,
does
that
dispose
of
this
case?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
doctrine
of
estoppel
that
being
no
evidence
of
patent
abuse
here.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
doctrine
of
estoppel
here
being
an
agreement
of
the
part
being
based
upon
an
agreement
of
the
parties
which
is
in
the
contract,
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
that
the
patent
will
not
be
--
that
the
validity
of
the
patent
will
not
be
attacked?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
derived
from
the
--
i
suppose
primarily
from
the
expressed
provision
in
the
contract
as
you
argue
it
from
the
expressed
provision
in
the
contract
that
if
upon
suit
of
a
third
party
that
patent
is
found
to
be
invalid
then
certain
consequences
follow,
and
i
suppose
you
derive
make
it
to
the
implication
from
that
the
parties
have
agreed
that
the
licensee
may
not
challenge
the
validity
of
the
patent.
justice
abe
fortas
it
is
fairly
customer
specified
isn't
in
as
i
recall
in
patent
license
agreements
cover
not
to
by
the
licensee
not
to
attack
the
validity
of
the
patent?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
the
one
page
agreement
to
which
mr.
cohen
referred
in
the
record?
justice
abe
fortas
was
that
reprinted
by
stipulation
to
you
counsel?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
believe
that
one
page
--
my
question
may
not
have
been
clear.
i
don't
believe
that
one
page
document
to
which
you
referred
is
the
one
page
document
to
which
mr.
cohen
referred
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
he
referred
to
a
one
page
agreement
between
lear
and
adkins
with
respect
to
inventions
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
which
--
justice
abe
fortas
the
same
document?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see,
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
does
the
so-called
michigan
--
does
the
so-called
michigan
patent
here
really
--
michigan
device
really
involved
a
question
under
the
patent
law?
justice
abe
fortas
as
distinguished
from
the
california,
i
think
i've
got
it
straightened.
the
michigan
device
up
to
during
the
--
up
to
the
time
of
term
notice
of
termination
any
way
was
not
patented,
was
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
was
it
patented
on
--
up
through
the
stipulated
time
or
the
cut
off
or
purposes,
cut
off
on
damages
for
purposes
of
this
litigation?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
that
was
the
so-called
california?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
talking
all
about
michigan
which
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
last
legs
on
someone,
i
don't
want
to
anticipate
your
argument
(voice
overlap).
justice
abe
fortas
don't
bother
to
answer
me
now
but
as
you
go
along,
i
trust
you
will.
justice
abe
fortas
i
brought
it
up
at
this
time
because
the
nature
of
your
opening
statement
but
it's
bothered
me
since
i
first
studied
this
case
whether
in
the
extent
to
which
this
is
truly
a
question
involving
the
patent
laws
of
the
united
states
or
whether
at
least
so
far
as
the
michigan
patent
is
concerned,
it's
a
contract
question
perhaps
under
antitrust
laws
generally.
i
don't
want
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
to
interfere
with
your
plain
argument
but
i
--
that
is
the
basic
problem
in
my
mind
in
this
case.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
that
--
are
you
talking
now
about
both
of
them?
justice
abe
fortas
on
what?
justice
abe
fortas
so,
i
just
have
a
greatest
difficulty
in
this
case
when
you
talk
about
both
of
them
together
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
because
i
understand
what
i've
read
in
the
briefs,
there
are
differences
in
fact
that
maybe
material
in
a
way
with
respect
to
california
and
michigan.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
that
charge
you
got
up
there
relates
only
to
michigan,
does
it?
justice
abe
fortas
yes
that
the
license
--
justice
abe
fortas
right.
justice
abe
fortas
on
michigan?
justice
abe
fortas
as
to
both.
as
to
both?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
right
as
to
terminate
was
that
confined
to
situation
in
which
patent
did
not
issue?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
don't
you
have
to
treat
the
michigan
steel
gyro
problem
as
license
to
use
know-how
or
none
patent
that
i
recall
--
justice
abe
fortas
how
do
you
--
why
do
you
talk
about
that
one
in
the
terms
of
patent
law?
that's
a
question
i
put
to
you
initially
and
it's
still
bothers
me.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at.
justice
abe
fortas
because
i
really
don't
understand
it
and
i
couldn't
--
i
just
entangle
it
from
your
brief.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
assuming
that
the
michigan
patent
here
is
invalid
and
assuming
that
petitioner
can
avail
itself
of
that
point,
is
that
in
your
judgment
dispose
of
the
claim
with
respect
to
compensation
for
the
use
of
the
michigan
device?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
your
--
you're
doing
something
more
than
asking
us
to
make
a
ruling
in
the
abstract,
aren't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
about
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
there's
no
question
about
the
california,
validity
of
the
california
patent,
is
there
in
this
case?
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
judgment
as
have
been
in
adjudication
that
the
michigan
patent
is
invalid
in
this
case
there
hasn't,
has
it?
justice
abe
fortas
but
there
was
such
an
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
there
was
an
adjudication
--
wasn't
there
an
adjudication,
was
it
in
the
intermediate
court?
justice
abe
fortas
invalid
at
the
trial
court.
so,
that
we
do
have
that
difference
in
the
posture
of
the
case
in
any
event
between
these
two
patents
and
you,
you
made
no
study
of
the
impact
of
accepting
your
theory
with
respect
to
whether
a
claim
survives?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
have
made
a
study
that's
helpful
to
us.
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
wouldn't
certainly
preclude
us,
would
it?
assuming
that
they
have
not
press
the
point
below
would
that
wouldn't
preclude
us
from
deciding
the
issue,
would
it?
this
is
not
an
issue
that
this
is
about
us
claiming
the
issue
of
law,
law
appearing
something
is
any
such
thing
as
one
could
readily
imagine.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
don't
want
to
take
more
of
your
time
but
certainly
there
were
plenty
of
federal
questions
raised
below
and
your
point,
i
take
it
is
that
assuming
that
this
particular
argument
was
not
made
below.
is
it
too
late
to
make
this
particular
argument
here?
justice
abe
fortas
you
said
if
i
understood
you
that
the
estoppel
claim
the
estoppel
of
the
patentee
related
only
the
part
of
the
issues
in
this
case,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
will
you
tell
us
about
that
sometime
in
the
course
of
your
argument.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
agree
or
disagree
that
this
contract
has
to
be
construed
and
applied
solely
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
patent
--
of
a
patent
contract
--
patent
license
contract?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
difficulty
i
have
with
your
argument
perhaps
is
what
is
really
going
on
here
is
that
you
seem
to
have
a
contract
here
that
depends
upon
the
patent
law
and
the
special
rights
flowing
from
patent
and
i
think
it's
under
the
patent
and
then
you,
you
hear
this
on
what
i've
been
trying
to
get
at
then
you
come
here
and
seems
to
me
in
what
you're
saying
at
least
in
large
part
is
that
even
if
the
patent
is
invalid
you're
still
entitled
to
those
same
rights
on
a
contract
basis
without
reference
to
the
patent.
that's
kind
of
a
heads
you
win
tails,
the
other
side
loses
or
tails
of
patent
system
loses.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
what
i'm
trying
--
you're
saying
this
certainly
looks
like
a
patent
agreement.
it
does
--
got
all
the
terminology
of
a
patent
agreement
with
respect
to
the
exhibit
c
rights
it's
â€“-
purports
to
give
the
other
party
and
exclusive
right
to
the
use
of
it,
it
smells
like
a
patent
agreement.
and
as
i
understand
it
what
you
say
here
is
that
even
if
the
patent
aspects
unlawful
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
you
can
resort
to
state
contract
law
and
still
collect
the
same
amounts
of
money
and
certain
practically
the
same
rights.
justice
abe
fortas
maybe
i
misunderstand
you
but
that's
what
i've
been
trying
to
get
at
in
my
questions
here
to
see
whether
that
is
in
fact
that
they
are
in
now
based
on
your
colloquy
with
justice
douglas.
it
seems
to
me
that
indeed
that
is
your
theory.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
it's
peculiarly
drafted
contracted
in
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
cohen,
in
what
respect
what
can
you
point
to
in
this
contract
that
distinguishes
it
really
from
the
ordinary
sort
of
contract
in
some
of
the
circumstances
where
a
party
has
an
item
for
which
he
has
filed
the
patent
application
and
he
makes
contract
with
somebody
else
for
the
use
of
that
item.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
your
case
and
perhaps
the
decision
of
the
california
court
depend
upon
your
argument
rather
than
the
decision
of
california
court
depend
upon
establishing
that
a
fundamental
proposition
which
goes
to
the
intention
of
the
parties
which
is
that
somehow
someway
this
is
not
to
be
looked
at
as
an
ordinary
agreement
with
respect
to
an
article
before
which
patent
application
has
been
filed
and
which
is
subject
to
the
federal
patent
law
but
somehow
someway
this
contract
is
to
be
read
in
terms
of
the
intention
of
the
parties
and
then
as
an
agreement
for
the
use
of
any
an
invention
without
reference
to
patentability.
certainly,
the
contract,
when
you
look
at
the
contract
it
looks
like
an
ordinary
patent
--
ordinary
agreement
under
the
patent
laws.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
it
was
too
bad,
wouldn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
not
yet?
justice
abe
fortas
alternatively
then
i
think
i
have
some
illumination
that
really
what
you're
urging
upon
us
is
that
we
construe
the
patent
license
agreement
which
is
the
agreement
upon
which
this
litigation
has
been
conducted
as
if
that
incorporated
the
spirit
and
substance
and
motivation
of
the
--
and
they
show
one
page
agreement
between
adkins
and
lear.
that's
about
what
it
comes
down
to.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
what
i
haven't
got
is
and
perhaps
it's
in
the
brief
and
i
don't
want
to
divert
your
argument
and
i
don't
recall
it
in
your
brief.
what
i
haven't
got
is
what
is
there
in
this
agreement
in
the
what
i
call
a
license
agreement
that
enables
us
to
disregard
the
fact
that
it's
patent
license
agreement?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
would
cut
pretty
far
one
because
practically
every
patent
license
agreement
involves
the
same
kind
of
--
involves
a
licensee
of
know-how
and
i
suppose
there
are
great
many
that
involved
facts
somewhat
like
this
in
terms
of
the
background
of
the
patent
license
agreement
itself
which
you
really
--
it's
possible
that
the
argument
is
that
an
invitation
to
this
court
to
supersede
some
aspect
that
at
least
the
federal
patent
law
where
the
parties
had
a
relationship
of
employer
or
employee
during
the
period
of
invention.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
the
motion
on
appeal
of
the
case.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
did
you
say
that
mr.
adkins
was
not
represented
by
counsel
in
drafting
of
this
agreement?
justice
abe
fortas
well
that,
that
point
is
contested
by
lear?
justice
abe
fortas
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
they
say
that
claim
9
does
not
cover
the
michigan
steel
gyros?
justice
abe
fortas
when
they
say
that
there
was
--
that
there's
no
evidence
to
support
the
jury's
verdict?
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
they
say?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
california
supreme
court
reinstated
the
jury
verdict?
justice
abe
fortas
--
on
this?
justice
abe
fortas
where
the
special
findings,
special
verdict
by
the
jury?
justice
abe
fortas
but
there
were
--
are
the
instructions
challenged?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
we
hold
in
this
case
that
there
is
no
showing
of
abuse,
patent
abuse
and
suppose
we
reiterate
what
you
assert
to
be
the
doctrine
of
that
the
licensee
having
agreed
i
take
it
that
it
will
not
attack
the
validity
of
the
patent
in
the
circumstances.
suppose
we
reiterate
that
it
is
estopped
from
attacking
it,
does
that
dispose
of
this
case?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
doctrine
of
estoppel
that
being
no
evidence
of
patent
abuse
here.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
doctrine
of
estoppel
here
being
an
agreement
of
the
part
being
based
upon
an
agreement
of
the
parties
which
is
in
the
contract,
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
that
the
patent
will
not
be
--
that
the
validity
of
the
patent
will
not
be
attacked?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
derived
from
the
--
i
suppose
primarily
from
the
expressed
provision
in
the
contract
as
you
argue
it
from
the
expressed
provision
in
the
contract
that
if
upon
suit
of
a
third
party
that
patent
is
found
to
be
invalid
then
certain
consequences
follow,
and
i
suppose
you
derive
make
it
to
the
implication
from
that
the
parties
have
agreed
that
the
licensee
may
not
challenge
the
validity
of
the
patent.
justice
abe
fortas
it
is
fairly
customer
specified
isn't
in
as
i
recall
in
patent
license
agreements
cover
not
to
by
the
licensee
not
to
attack
the
validity
of
the
patent?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
the
one
page
agreement
to
which
mr.
cohen
referred
in
the
record?
justice
abe
fortas
was
that
reprinted
by
stipulation
to
you
counsel?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
believe
that
one
page
--
my
question
may
not
have
been
clear.
i
don't
believe
that
one
page
document
to
which
you
referred
is
the
one
page
document
to
which
mr.
cohen
referred
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
he
referred
to
a
one
page
agreement
between
lear
and
adkins
with
respect
to
inventions
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
which
--
justice
abe
fortas
the
same
document?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see,
thank
you.
