mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
believes
that
the
time
has
come
for
this
court
to
hold
that
the
most
fundamental
policies
of
the
federal
patent
and
antitrust
laws
forbid
the
application
in
state
or
federal
courts
of
doctrines
of
estoppel
which
result
in
court
enforcement
of
invalid
patent
monopoly.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
believe
that
was
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
believe
it
is
necessarily
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
believe
that
it
is
before
this
court
and
if
you
like
your
honor
i'll
turn
directly
to
that
problem
since
respondent
raises
this
contention
in
its
brief
in
this
court.
respondent
contends
that
the
estoppel
issue
is
not
before
this
court
because
lear
never
claimed
in
the
state
courts
that
federal
law
gave
it
the
right
to
contest
that
validity
of
the
patent.
but
in
our
examination
of
the
briefs
that
have
been
certified
to
this
court
is
a
part
of
the
record.
we
see
that
lear
did
make
this
claim
based
on
federal
law
in
the
briefs.
i
believe
the
clearest
example
can
be
found
on
pages
25
through
28
of
lear's
reply
brief
in
the
district
court
of
appeal
in
california
which
under
california
practice
also
becomes
the
brief
in
the
supreme
court,
litigants
are
forbidden
from
filing
new
briefs
in
the
supreme
court
of
california.
this
portion
of
lear's
brief
has
not
been
reproduced
in
the
printed
appendix
but
it
has
been
certified
by
the
clerk
as
a
part
of
the
record
and
it
is
on
file
with
the
clerk
in
this
court.
and
let
me
just
summarize
for
you
why
i
think
this
is
a
clear
example
and
the
government
thinks
this
is
a
clear
example
of
the
petitioners
having
raised
the
federal
issue
before
the
state
courts.
beginning
on
page
25
of
that
reply
brief,
the
petitioner
refers
to
the
provisions
of
article
1
of
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
they
have
not
--
this
is
not
been
reprinted
in
the
appendix.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
you
don't
have
it
among
your
papers.
that
is
correct
sir.
but
it
is
on
file
with
the
clerk
here
as
the
part
of
the
record
that
was
not
printed
in
the
printed
appendix.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
on
file
with
the
clerk
of
this
court,
yes
mr.
justice
but
it
was
not
printed
in
the
appendix.
beginning
on
page
and
this
is
pages
25
through
28
of
that
brief,
the
reply
brief
before
the
state
appellate
courts.
beginning
on
page
25,
lear
referred
to
and
quoted
from
article
1
of
the
federal
constitution,
the
patent
clause
and
then
elaborated
some
of
the
provisions
of
the
patent
code
which
congress
has
enacted
and
then
in
the
course
of
this
particular
contention
said,
“a
license
or
contract
concerning
patent
applications
and
patents
have
more
than
the
usual
two
interested
parties.”
patents
from
their
inception
have
been
designed
to
promote
the
progress
of
science
and
we're
instituted
for
the
public's
benefit
and
not
as
a
reward
for
the
inventor
citing
an
opinion
of
this
court
kendall
against
winsor
in
21
howard.
this
is
followed
by
quotations
from
two
other
federal
cases,
one
an
opinion
of
this
court,
the
precision
instrument
manufacturing
company
case
in
324
u.s.
and
then
a
ninth
circuit
case.
and
then
finally
at
the
conclusion
of
this
portion
of
the
argument,
the
contention
was
put
this
way.
in
the
present
action,
the
trial
court
expressly
found
that
plaintiff's
patent
attempts
to
cover
something
that
is
in
the
existing
fund
of
public
knowledge
and
something
that
would
be
obvious
to
one
skilled
in
art.
thus,
plaintiff's
patent
is
invalid.
it
does
not
provide
protection
for
any
device
or
product
and
its
validity
with
respect
to
the
2156
gyros
can
be
contested
by
defendant
and
also
by
everyone
else
because
of
the
public
interest
which
is
involved.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
it
did.
it
explicitly
held
that
the
patent
estoppel
doctrine
is
applicable
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
pages
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
are
25
through
28.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
of
the
reply
brief
submitted
by
lear
in
the
district
court
of
appeal.
this
is
the
brief
that
refers
to
civil
actions
numbers
28624
and
30089.
there
were
numerous
briefs
but
this
is
the
reply
brief,
it's
the
brown
covered
brief.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
of
lear
in
the
district
court
of
appeal
and
also
in
the
supreme
court
of
california.
now
on
page
191
of
the
first
volume
of
the
reprinted
appendix
where
you
have
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
california,
you
have
the
holding
in
very
explicit
terms
right
in
the
middle
of
page
191,
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
is
applicable
and
lear
is
foreclosed
from
challenging
the
validity
of
adkins'
patent.
now,
we
are
off
the
view
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
are
of
the
view
that
since
the
question
of
federal
law
was
presented
to
the
court
and
the
court
rejected
that
contention
by
applying
the
doctrine
of
estoppel
that
this
necessarily
meant
that
the
california
supreme
court
passed
on
the
question
of
federal
law.
now,
in
the
pages
that
i
referred
you
to
in
the
brief
before
the
california
court
we're
of
the
view
that
because
only
federal
authorities
are
cited
throughout
these
three
and
a
half
pages
and
the
arguments
ends
at
that
point.
a
new
point
is
taken
off.
these
--
the
clear
intendment
of
these
pages
of
the
brief
is
to
raise
this
issue
as
a
federal
claim
and
this
was
sufficient
under
the
standard
which
this
court
applied
in
braniff
airways,
incorporated
against
the
nebraska
state
board
of
equalization
in
347
u.s.
where
the
clear
intendment
was
to
assert
a
federal
claim,
no
precise
terminology
need
be
followed
in
presenting
that
claim
so
long
as
the
state
court
does
pass
upon
it.
now,
it
is
true
that
this
reply
brief
raising
the
issue
was
concerned
only
with
the
aspects
of
the
case
relating
to
the
so-called
california
gyro
and
not
to
the
michigan
gyro.
but
it
is
also
true
that
the
state's
supreme
court
consolidated
all
aspects
of
the
case
to
gather
into
one
appeal
and
into
one
opinion.
and
thus,
had
this
federal
claim
before
it
and
passed
upon
it
for
purposes
of
the
entire
case.
but
even
in
the
absence
of
consolidation
in
the
court
below,
the
issue
of
licensee
estoppel
would
still
be
before
this
court
because
a
part
of
the
judgment
awarded
is
for
royalties
for
manufacture
of
the
california
gyro,
the
claimed
invention
with
respect
to
which
this
point
was
specifically
raised.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
in
that
case,
the
issue
of
the
validity
of
the
patent
is
still
undecided.
the
petitioner
has
submitted
this
issue
to
this
court
--
this
court
in
its
discretion
could
pass
upon
it
or
could
remand
the
case
for
consideration
of
that
and
other
issues
that
may
still
remain
in
the
case
by
the
state
courts.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
on
page
191
of
volume
1
of
the
appendix,
of
the
printed
appendix;
right
in
the
middle
of
the
page.
it
follows
also
that
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
is
applicable
and
lear
is
foreclosed
from
challenging
the
validity
of
adkins'
patent.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
this
is
necessary
to
the
decision,
yes
sir
as
we
read
the
california
decision.
therefore,
the
united
states
believes
that
the
issue
is
before
this
court
and
we
have
addressed
ourselves
to
the
issue
of
whether
the
licensee
estoppel
doctrine
should
now
be
eliminated
in
view
of
the
weight
and
the
teaching
of
this
court's
decisions
in
recent
years
which
have
required
exceptions
to
the
doctrine
and
which
otherwise
have
closely
confined
court
enforcement
to
monopolies
to
the
limited
scope
authorized
by
the
federal
patent
laws.
under
our
patent
system
unlike
that
of
some
european
countries,
patent
monopolies
are
granted
in
essentially
ex
parte
non-adversary
administrative
proceedings
and
as
this
court
and
other
courts
and
indeed
congress
had
have
frequent
occasion
to
observe
this
system
results
in
the
issuance
of
numerous
patents
for
articles
which
do
not
meet
the
requisites
standard
of
invention
upon
later
investigation,
an
adversary
investigation.
therefore,
as
we
show
in
our
brief
the
public
interest
is
strongly
dependent
under
our
patent
system
on
the
availability
of
opportunities
for
private
litigants
to
expose
invalid
patent
monopolies
before
the
courts
in
order
to
free
the
public
from
their
economic
effects.
in
many
instances,
a
licensee
may
be
the
only
potential
litigant
who
combines
the
requisite
knowledge
with
the
requisite
incentive
to
mount
that
challenge.
the
practicalities
of
the
business
situation
may
well
have
induced
to
licensee
to
enter
into
the
license
agreement
even
though
he
had
doubts
about
the
validity
of
the
patent
or
had
not
had
time
to
investigate
the
question
of
validity.
for
example,
a
government
contractor
such
as
the
petitioner
must
assure
himself
before
he
submits
his
bid
that
he
will
be
able
to
perform
the
contract.
and
this
means
that
he
must
have
a
legal
right
to
make
and
sell
every
component
required.
when
some
of
those
components
are
covered
in
issued
patents
or
in
patent
applications,
the
pressure
to
enter
into
license
agreements
would
seem
obvious.
the
basic
vise
of
the
estoppel
doctrine
is
that
it
converts
those
licenses
into
incontestable
devices
for
the
economic
effectuation
of
invalid
patent
monopolies.
now,
it
is
instructive
to
remember
that
this
court's
early
recognition
of
the
doctrine
of
patent
licensee
estoppel
in
the
1855
case
of
kinsman
against
parkhurst
and
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
it
was
a
recognition
not
a
holding
there.
this
occurred
35
years
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
sherman
antitrust
law,
when
the
patent
laws
were
not
yet
viewed
as
it
carefully
confined
exception
to
the
broad
interdiction
of
monopolization
in
the
antitrust
laws.
and
this
court's
first
significant
limitation
of
the
estoppel
doctrine
in
pope
manufacturing
co.against
gormully
occurred
in
1892
two
years
after
the
enactment
of
the
sherman
law.
later,
in
the
sola
electric,
katzinger,
and
macgregor
cases
discussed
in
our
brief,
this
court
held
that
the
estoppel
doctrine
may
not
be
applied
when
the
license
agreement
contains
a
price
fixing
clause.
and
in
scott
paper
company
against
marcalus
company,
the
court
held
that
an
assignor
cannot
be
estopped
from
showing
that
he
was
not
infringing
the
assigned
patent
because
he
was
using
only
the
prior
art
of
an
expired
patent
even
though
in
the
circumstances;
this
amounted
to
a
showing
that
the
patent
he
assigned
had
been
anticipated
and
was
therefore
invalid.
in
his
perceptive
and
candid
dissenting
opinions
in
those
cases,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out
they
have
the
general
doctrines
of
assignor
estoppel
and
licensee
estoppel
really
could
not
withstand
the
rational
of
those
decisions.
and
ultimately
would
have
to
yield
to
the
same
considerations
of
the
public
interest
that
govern
the
court's
decisions
in
those
cases.
but
several
years
later,
a
majority
of
the
court
tersely
re-endorsed
the
general
doctrine
of
the
licensee
estoppel
in
the
hazeltine
case
and
said
that
the
previous
cases
meant
that
estoppel
is
forbidden
only
if
the
license
attempts
to
enlarge
the
patent
monopoly
through
price
fixing
for
example.
but
as
mr.
justice
douglas
joined
by
mr.
justice
black
asked
in
dissent
in
that
case,
what
more
egregious
enlargement
of
monopoly
is
there
from
the
standpoint
of
public
harm
than
the
attachment
of
a
patent
monopoly
to
an
unpatentable
article.
the
majority
opinion
did
not
answer
that
question,
the
question
remains
unanswered
and
united
states
submits
the
question
is
unanswerable.
more
recently
in
the
sears,
roebuck
against
stiffel
and
compco
cases,
this
court
held
that
the
states
cannot
confer
upon
the
originator
of
the
design,
the
power
to
exclude
others
from
copying
that
design
that
the
power
to
exclude
is
the
exclusive
province
of
the
federal
patent
laws
and
can
attach
only
to
a
valid
federal
patent.
now,
the
power
to
exclude
others
for
making,
using
or
selling
which
is
conferred
by
a
patent
is
often
utilize
by
the
patentee
conditionally
in
order
to
read
economic
rewards
from
the
patent.
or
he
excludes
others
from
using
the
product
unless
they
buy
it
from
him
or
he
excludes
others
from
making
and
selling
the
product
unless
they
pay
him
and
agreed
upon
royalty.
this
is
precisely
the
power
to
exclude
which
the
decision
below
has
given
to
the
respondent
even
if
his
patent
is
invalid.
and
california
has
thus
used
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
to
trespass
upon
the
domain
of
the
federal
patent
laws
and
to
enlarge
the
impact
on
the
economy
of
patent
monopoly
rights.
from
that,
which
is
authorized
by
the
federal
laws
just
as
the
illinois
law
of
unfair
competition
had
been
used
in
stiffel
and
compco
to
trespass
upon
the
federal
domain
and
enlarge
monopoly
powers.
in
those
cases,
this
court
held
that
the
states
must
be
confined
to
remedies
that
are
compatible
with
the
policies
of
federal
law
such
as
the
requirement
of
labeling
in
that
factual
context.
and
likewise
here,
we
have
argued
in
the
concluding
pages
of
our
brief
that
the
states
may
device
remedies
to
do
equity
between
businessmen
which
do
not
conflict
with
federal
law,
but
the
state
should
be
barred
from
sacrificing
the
public
interest
by
applying
doctrines
of
estoppel
that
result
in
enforcement
of
monopolies
that
are
not
authorized
by
a
federal
law.
only
last
term
in
the
perma
life
muffler's
case
this
court
reiterated
that
we
are
dealing
here
in
an
area
in
which
the
court
has
often
indicated
the
inappropriateness
of
invoking
broad
common
law
barriers
to
relief
where
litigation
serves
important
public
interests.
and
so,
the
united
states
asked
this
court
in
this
case
to
relieve
the
people
of
this
country
of
the
burden
of
having
to
pay
royalties
for
the
use
of
non-inventions
and
to
give
the
people
what
the
constitution
and
the
laws
of
the
congress
say
is
rightfully
theirs,
the
free
use
of
all
the
technology
that
is
in
the
public
domain.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
united
states
has
not
really
formulated
a
position
on
that
question
but
i
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
of
course
the
california
--
there's
no
problem
in
california
device
at
all.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
with
respect
to
the
michigan
device,
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
there
was
estoppel
applied
with
respect
to
both
patents
and
lear
was
estopped
from
contesting
the
validity
of
either
patent
and
the
judgment
reflects
royalties
for
the
use
of
both
patents.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
there
has
not
because
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
because
the
trial
court
held
lear
estopped
from
the
outset
with
respect
to
that.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
was
at
the
trial
court
that
the
michigan
device
was
held
to
be
invalid.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i've
made
a
study
of
it
but
the
united
states
has
not
taken
a
position
with
respect
to
that
question
subject
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
agreement
so
stated
and
the
basis
for
the
royalty
payments
having
been
awarded
in
the
judgment
of
the
california
court
is
that
lear
was
estopped
to
contest
the
validity
of
either
patent.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
believes
that
the
time
has
come
for
this
court
to
hold
that
the
most
fundamental
policies
of
the
federal
patent
and
antitrust
laws
forbid
the
application
in
state
or
federal
courts
of
doctrines
of
estoppel
which
result
in
court
enforcement
of
invalid
patent
monopoly.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
believe
that
was
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
believe
it
is
necessarily
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
believe
that
it
is
before
this
court
and
if
you
like
your
honor
i'll
turn
directly
to
that
problem
since
respondent
raises
this
contention
in
its
brief
in
this
court.
respondent
contends
that
the
estoppel
issue
is
not
before
this
court
because
lear
never
claimed
in
the
state
courts
that
federal
law
gave
it
the
right
to
contest
that
validity
of
the
patent.
but
in
our
examination
of
the
briefs
that
have
been
certified
to
this
court
is
a
part
of
the
record.
we
see
that
lear
did
make
this
claim
based
on
federal
law
in
the
briefs.
i
believe
the
clearest
example
can
be
found
on
pages
25
through
28
of
lear's
reply
brief
in
the
district
court
of
appeal
in
california
which
under
california
practice
also
becomes
the
brief
in
the
supreme
court,
litigants
are
forbidden
from
filing
new
briefs
in
the
supreme
court
of
california.
this
portion
of
lear's
brief
has
not
been
reproduced
in
the
printed
appendix
but
it
has
been
certified
by
the
clerk
as
a
part
of
the
record
and
it
is
on
file
with
the
clerk
in
this
court.
and
let
me
just
summarize
for
you
why
i
think
this
is
a
clear
example
and
the
government
thinks
this
is
a
clear
example
of
the
petitioners
having
raised
the
federal
issue
before
the
state
courts.
beginning
on
page
25
of
that
reply
brief,
the
petitioner
refers
to
the
provisions
of
article
1
of
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
they
have
not
--
this
is
not
been
reprinted
in
the
appendix.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
you
don't
have
it
among
your
papers.
that
is
correct
sir.
but
it
is
on
file
with
the
clerk
here
as
the
part
of
the
record
that
was
not
printed
in
the
printed
appendix.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
on
file
with
the
clerk
of
this
court,
yes
mr.
justice
but
it
was
not
printed
in
the
appendix.
beginning
on
page
and
this
is
pages
25
through
28
of
that
brief,
the
reply
brief
before
the
state
appellate
courts.
beginning
on
page
25,
lear
referred
to
and
quoted
from
article
1
of
the
federal
constitution,
the
patent
clause
and
then
elaborated
some
of
the
provisions
of
the
patent
code
which
congress
has
enacted
and
then
in
the
course
of
this
particular
contention
said,
“a
license
or
contract
concerning
patent
applications
and
patents
have
more
than
the
usual
two
interested
parties.”
patents
from
their
inception
have
been
designed
to
promote
the
progress
of
science
and
we're
instituted
for
the
public's
benefit
and
not
as
a
reward
for
the
inventor
citing
an
opinion
of
this
court
kendall
against
winsor
in
21
howard.
this
is
followed
by
quotations
from
two
other
federal
cases,
one
an
opinion
of
this
court,
the
precision
instrument
manufacturing
company
case
in
324
u.s.
and
then
a
ninth
circuit
case.
and
then
finally
at
the
conclusion
of
this
portion
of
the
argument,
the
contention
was
put
this
way.
in
the
present
action,
the
trial
court
expressly
found
that
plaintiff's
patent
attempts
to
cover
something
that
is
in
the
existing
fund
of
public
knowledge
and
something
that
would
be
obvious
to
one
skilled
in
art.
thus,
plaintiff's
patent
is
invalid.
it
does
not
provide
protection
for
any
device
or
product
and
its
validity
with
respect
to
the
2156
gyros
can
be
contested
by
defendant
and
also
by
everyone
else
because
of
the
public
interest
which
is
involved.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
it
did.
it
explicitly
held
that
the
patent
estoppel
doctrine
is
applicable
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
pages
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
are
25
through
28.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
of
the
reply
brief
submitted
by
lear
in
the
district
court
of
appeal.
this
is
the
brief
that
refers
to
civil
actions
numbers
28624
and
30089.
there
were
numerous
briefs
but
this
is
the
reply
brief,
it's
the
brown
covered
brief.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
of
lear
in
the
district
court
of
appeal
and
also
in
the
supreme
court
of
california.
now
on
page
191
of
the
first
volume
of
the
reprinted
appendix
where
you
have
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
california,
you
have
the
holding
in
very
explicit
terms
right
in
the
middle
of
page
191,
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
is
applicable
and
lear
is
foreclosed
from
challenging
the
validity
of
adkins'
patent.
now,
we
are
off
the
view
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
are
of
the
view
that
since
the
question
of
federal
law
was
presented
to
the
court
and
the
court
rejected
that
contention
by
applying
the
doctrine
of
estoppel
that
this
necessarily
meant
that
the
california
supreme
court
passed
on
the
question
of
federal
law.
now,
in
the
pages
that
i
referred
you
to
in
the
brief
before
the
california
court
we're
of
the
view
that
because
only
federal
authorities
are
cited
throughout
these
three
and
a
half
pages
and
the
arguments
ends
at
that
point.
a
new
point
is
taken
off.
these
--
the
clear
intendment
of
these
pages
of
the
brief
is
to
raise
this
issue
as
a
federal
claim
and
this
was
sufficient
under
the
standard
which
this
court
applied
in
braniff
airways,
incorporated
against
the
nebraska
state
board
of
equalization
in
347
u.s.
where
the
clear
intendment
was
to
assert
a
federal
claim,
no
precise
terminology
need
be
followed
in
presenting
that
claim
so
long
as
the
state
court
does
pass
upon
it.
now,
it
is
true
that
this
reply
brief
raising
the
issue
was
concerned
only
with
the
aspects
of
the
case
relating
to
the
so-called
california
gyro
and
not
to
the
michigan
gyro.
but
it
is
also
true
that
the
state's
supreme
court
consolidated
all
aspects
of
the
case
to
gather
into
one
appeal
and
into
one
opinion.
and
thus,
had
this
federal
claim
before
it
and
passed
upon
it
for
purposes
of
the
entire
case.
but
even
in
the
absence
of
consolidation
in
the
court
below,
the
issue
of
licensee
estoppel
would
still
be
before
this
court
because
a
part
of
the
judgment
awarded
is
for
royalties
for
manufacture
of
the
california
gyro,
the
claimed
invention
with
respect
to
which
this
point
was
specifically
raised.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
in
that
case,
the
issue
of
the
validity
of
the
patent
is
still
undecided.
the
petitioner
has
submitted
this
issue
to
this
court
--
this
court
in
its
discretion
could
pass
upon
it
or
could
remand
the
case
for
consideration
of
that
and
other
issues
that
may
still
remain
in
the
case
by
the
state
courts.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
on
page
191
of
volume
1
of
the
appendix,
of
the
printed
appendix;
right
in
the
middle
of
the
page.
it
follows
also
that
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
is
applicable
and
lear
is
foreclosed
from
challenging
the
validity
of
adkins'
patent.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
this
is
necessary
to
the
decision,
yes
sir
as
we
read
the
california
decision.
therefore,
the
united
states
believes
that
the
issue
is
before
this
court
and
we
have
addressed
ourselves
to
the
issue
of
whether
the
licensee
estoppel
doctrine
should
now
be
eliminated
in
view
of
the
weight
and
the
teaching
of
this
court's
decisions
in
recent
years
which
have
required
exceptions
to
the
doctrine
and
which
otherwise
have
closely
confined
court
enforcement
to
monopolies
to
the
limited
scope
authorized
by
the
federal
patent
laws.
under
our
patent
system
unlike
that
of
some
european
countries,
patent
monopolies
are
granted
in
essentially
ex
parte
non-adversary
administrative
proceedings
and
as
this
court
and
other
courts
and
indeed
congress
had
have
frequent
occasion
to
observe
this
system
results
in
the
issuance
of
numerous
patents
for
articles
which
do
not
meet
the
requisites
standard
of
invention
upon
later
investigation,
an
adversary
investigation.
therefore,
as
we
show
in
our
brief
the
public
interest
is
strongly
dependent
under
our
patent
system
on
the
availability
of
opportunities
for
private
litigants
to
expose
invalid
patent
monopolies
before
the
courts
in
order
to
free
the
public
from
their
economic
effects.
in
many
instances,
a
licensee
may
be
the
only
potential
litigant
who
combines
the
requisite
knowledge
with
the
requisite
incentive
to
mount
that
challenge.
the
practicalities
of
the
business
situation
may
well
have
induced
to
licensee
to
enter
into
the
license
agreement
even
though
he
had
doubts
about
the
validity
of
the
patent
or
had
not
had
time
to
investigate
the
question
of
validity.
for
example,
a
government
contractor
such
as
the
petitioner
must
assure
himself
before
he
submits
his
bid
that
he
will
be
able
to
perform
the
contract.
and
this
means
that
he
must
have
a
legal
right
to
make
and
sell
every
component
required.
when
some
of
those
components
are
covered
in
issued
patents
or
in
patent
applications,
the
pressure
to
enter
into
license
agreements
would
seem
obvious.
the
basic
vise
of
the
estoppel
doctrine
is
that
it
converts
those
licenses
into
incontestable
devices
for
the
economic
effectuation
of
invalid
patent
monopolies.
now,
it
is
instructive
to
remember
that
this
court's
early
recognition
of
the
doctrine
of
patent
licensee
estoppel
in
the
1855
case
of
kinsman
against
parkhurst
and
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
it
was
a
recognition
not
a
holding
there.
this
occurred
35
years
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
sherman
antitrust
law,
when
the
patent
laws
were
not
yet
viewed
as
it
carefully
confined
exception
to
the
broad
interdiction
of
monopolization
in
the
antitrust
laws.
and
this
court's
first
significant
limitation
of
the
estoppel
doctrine
in
pope
manufacturing
co.against
gormully
occurred
in
1892
two
years
after
the
enactment
of
the
sherman
law.
later,
in
the
sola
electric,
katzinger,
and
macgregor
cases
discussed
in
our
brief,
this
court
held
that
the
estoppel
doctrine
may
not
be
applied
when
the
license
agreement
contains
a
price
fixing
clause.
and
in
scott
paper
company
against
marcalus
company,
the
court
held
that
an
assignor
cannot
be
estopped
from
showing
that
he
was
not
infringing
the
assigned
patent
because
he
was
using
only
the
prior
art
of
an
expired
patent
even
though
in
the
circumstances;
this
amounted
to
a
showing
that
the
patent
he
assigned
had
been
anticipated
and
was
therefore
invalid.
in
his
perceptive
and
candid
dissenting
opinions
in
those
cases,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out
they
have
the
general
doctrines
of
assignor
estoppel
and
licensee
estoppel
really
could
not
withstand
the
rational
of
those
decisions.
and
ultimately
would
have
to
yield
to
the
same
considerations
of
the
public
interest
that
govern
the
court's
decisions
in
those
cases.
but
several
years
later,
a
majority
of
the
court
tersely
re-endorsed
the
general
doctrine
of
the
licensee
estoppel
in
the
hazeltine
case
and
said
that
the
previous
cases
meant
that
estoppel
is
forbidden
only
if
the
license
attempts
to
enlarge
the
patent
monopoly
through
price
fixing
for
example.
but
as
mr.
justice
douglas
joined
by
mr.
justice
black
asked
in
dissent
in
that
case,
what
more
egregious
enlargement
of
monopoly
is
there
from
the
standpoint
of
public
harm
than
the
attachment
of
a
patent
monopoly
to
an
unpatentable
article.
the
majority
opinion
did
not
answer
that
question,
the
question
remains
unanswered
and
united
states
submits
the
question
is
unanswerable.
more
recently
in
the
sears,
roebuck
against
stiffel
and
compco
cases,
this
court
held
that
the
states
cannot
confer
upon
the
originator
of
the
design,
the
power
to
exclude
others
from
copying
that
design
that
the
power
to
exclude
is
the
exclusive
province
of
the
federal
patent
laws
and
can
attach
only
to
a
valid
federal
patent.
now,
the
power
to
exclude
others
for
making,
using
or
selling
which
is
conferred
by
a
patent
is
often
utilize
by
the
patentee
conditionally
in
order
to
read
economic
rewards
from
the
patent.
or
he
excludes
others
from
using
the
product
unless
they
buy
it
from
him
or
he
excludes
others
from
making
and
selling
the
product
unless
they
pay
him
and
agreed
upon
royalty.
this
is
precisely
the
power
to
exclude
which
the
decision
below
has
given
to
the
respondent
even
if
his
patent
is
invalid.
and
california
has
thus
used
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
to
trespass
upon
the
domain
of
the
federal
patent
laws
and
to
enlarge
the
impact
on
the
economy
of
patent
monopoly
rights.
from
that,
which
is
authorized
by
the
federal
laws
just
as
the
illinois
law
of
unfair
competition
had
been
used
in
stiffel
and
compco
to
trespass
upon
the
federal
domain
and
enlarge
monopoly
powers.
in
those
cases,
this
court
held
that
the
states
must
be
confined
to
remedies
that
are
compatible
with
the
policies
of
federal
law
such
as
the
requirement
of
labeling
in
that
factual
context.
and
likewise
here,
we
have
argued
in
the
concluding
pages
of
our
brief
that
the
states
may
device
remedies
to
do
equity
between
businessmen
which
do
not
conflict
with
federal
law,
but
the
state
should
be
barred
from
sacrificing
the
public
interest
by
applying
doctrines
of
estoppel
that
result
in
enforcement
of
monopolies
that
are
not
authorized
by
a
federal
law.
only
last
term
in
the
perma
life
muffler's
case
this
court
reiterated
that
we
are
dealing
here
in
an
area
in
which
the
court
has
often
indicated
the
inappropriateness
of
invoking
broad
common
law
barriers
to
relief
where
litigation
serves
important
public
interests.
and
so,
the
united
states
asked
this
court
in
this
case
to
relieve
the
people
of
this
country
of
the
burden
of
having
to
pay
royalties
for
the
use
of
non-inventions
and
to
give
the
people
what
the
constitution
and
the
laws
of
the
congress
say
is
rightfully
theirs,
the
free
use
of
all
the
technology
that
is
in
the
public
domain.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
united
states
has
not
really
formulated
a
position
on
that
question
but
i
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
of
course
the
california
--
there's
no
problem
in
california
device
at
all.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
with
respect
to
the
michigan
device,
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
there
was
estoppel
applied
with
respect
to
both
patents
and
lear
was
estopped
from
contesting
the
validity
of
either
patent
and
the
judgment
reflects
royalties
for
the
use
of
both
patents.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
there
has
not
because
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
because
the
trial
court
held
lear
estopped
from
the
outset
with
respect
to
that.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
was
at
the
trial
court
that
the
michigan
device
was
held
to
be
invalid.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i've
made
a
study
of
it
but
the
united
states
has
not
taken
a
position
with
respect
to
that
question
subject
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
agreement
so
stated
and
the
basis
for
the
royalty
payments
having
been
awarded
in
the
judgment
of
the
california
court
is
that
lear
was
estopped
to
contest
the
validity
of
either
patent.
