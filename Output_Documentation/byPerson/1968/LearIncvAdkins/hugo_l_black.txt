appendix

justice

black
i
don't
exactly
understand
what
it
is,
you
say
that
they
did
not
raise
with
specificity.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
did
they
raise
the
question
of
what
law
governs
state
or
federal
in
the
trial
of
the
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
if
the
court
decided
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
assumed
all
along
the
line
has
been
at
legal
controversy
for
years
haven't
it
in
all
the
courts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
they
conceded
that
the
state
law
governed
on
that
point?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
they
conceded
that
point?
justice
hugo
l.
black
licensee
was
barred
because
he
has
been
involved
in
licensee
leaving
the
validity
of
the
patent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
is
that
in
the
pleadings?
did
they
do
that
in
an
absence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
but
conceded
the
validity
of
it
under
any
law,
should
they
ever
concede
the
validity
of
it
under
any
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
assume
(voice

where
in
the
record
can
i
find
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
all?
appendix
number
1.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i've
read
that
a
moment
ago
and
i
didn't
--
maybe
i
thought
maybe
i
have
the
wrong
one.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
california
legislature
had
enacted
the
bill
and
the
government
had
signed
it
as
a
law
to
this
effect,
can
this
state
any
person
who
signs
a
license
agreement
well
have
must
pay
even
though
the
patent
is
bold
and
has
been
so
held
by
the
supreme
court
of
united
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
do
you
think
that
would
be
a
valid
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
in
that,
what
happened
then,
why
isn't
that
if
that
was
the
question
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
have
done
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
we're
free
to
contract
under
the
others
so
far
as
to
say
that
you're
not
only
can
contract
but
it's
gone
despite
the
fact
if
it
hasn't
gone,
that
would
leave
him
free
to
contract.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then
--
what
he
shall
pay
what
he
has
agreed
to
pay
even
though
the
patent
is
void
and
so
held
under
laws
of
united
states.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
should
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
if
the
federal
law
gives
it
to
him
and
deprives
him
of
the
obligation
of
paying
where
the
services
of
a
void
patent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
so
you
get
back
to
that
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we'll
suppose
now
that
a
discovery
which
he
had
but
the
law
has
found
out
there
was
no
discovery
and
therefore
he
did
nothing
after
all.
why
would
any
person
be
deprived
of
raising
that
because
of
some
contract
he
has
made?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
contracts
his
right
away
to
raise
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
except
when
it
gets
into
the
patent
fee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
you're
saying
they
have
agreed
to
by
something
just
to
show
they
want
to
buy
and
agreed
to
pay
it
but
you
have
to
fall
back
here
in
your
case
do
fall
back
in
all
of
your
pleadings
on
a
patent.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
we
were
to
hold
if
the
patent
is
void
and
that
the
man
doesn't
have
to
pay
it
there
is
no
estoppel
that
can
be
raise
with
reference
to
it
and
that's
all
we
held,
what
would
you
say
would
be
the
right
in
california
the
parties
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
say
that,
exactly
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
appendix
1
--
182?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
last
one,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
55
(voice
overlap)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
have
any
relevance
to
the
issue?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
put
it
in
the
reliance
on
the
clause
that
this
should
be
governed
by
the
clause
of
state
of
california?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
the
one
though
where
they
did
have
a
lawyer
before
they
had
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
this
thing
used
before
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
manufacture
of
what?
what
is
the
basic
thing
they
make?
justice
hugo
l.
black
very
widely
used,
is
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
few
minutes
ago,
you
referred
to
$67
million
about
something,
what
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
$67
million?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
other
companies
were
making
the
design?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
making
anything
like
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i've
thought.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
same
thing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
the
court
right
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
a
court
rule.
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
a
court
rule,
was
it
wrong
for
the
court
to
say
that
they
can
have
both
feeds?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whose
evidence
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
was
it
said
he
wanted
to
submit
it
to
his
attorney?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
arguing
is
that
if
that
is
irrelevant
fact
it
is
not
in
this
record
as
shown
to
be
of
fact.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
you've
been
saying
it's
not
in
the
record,
do
you
mean
it's
not
in
the
record
that
submitted
to
us
for
how
consideration
or
if
that's
what
you
mean,
how
could
you
say
it
is
here
on

that
u
exhibit
that
you're
talking
about?
how
did
you,
you
said
exhibit
u
is
share
in
some
things.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
this
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
was
often
you
say
but
was
not
admitted
in
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
you
mean
when
you
say
it's
not
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
each
on
of
them?
justice
hugo

black
well,
was
admitted
as
evidence?
justice
hugo

black
or
admitted
for
identification
only?
justice
hugo

black
so,
it
is
not
in
the

here
we
have
considered
it?
justice

black
consider
it
for
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
offered
that's
not
admitted?
justice
hugo

black
but
it
might
be
admissible
and
relevant
that
it
might
not,
did
the
court
hold
that
was
admitted
