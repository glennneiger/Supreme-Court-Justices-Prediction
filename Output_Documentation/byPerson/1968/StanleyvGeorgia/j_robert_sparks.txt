mr.
j.
robert
sparks
if
it
please
the
court.
i
am
the
trial
counsel
who
prosecuted
this
case
in
the
court
below,
the
superior
court
of
fulton
county.
so
the
court
has
original
trial
counsel.
mr.
asinof
was
a
defense
counsel.
now,
i
want
to
point
out
several
things
to
the
court
which
i
think
mr.
asinof
neglected
to
point
out
because
he
was
so
wrapped
up
in
his
own
argument.
one
is
this,
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
georgia
statute
contains
the
element
of
scienter.
i
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
ruled
on
that
in
this
very
case.
the
court
said,
i'm
just
reading
in
part,
just
a
line.
it's
contended
that
being
contended
that
the
requirement
of
reasonable
knowledge
would
withdraw
the
element
of
scienter
from
the
definition
of
the
offense
and
would
render
a
person
guilty
without
actual
knowledge
of
the
obscene
nature
of
the
matter.
this
contention
is
without
merit.
now,
your
honor,
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
where
a
state
statute
is
interpreted
by
the
highest
court
of
its
state,
that
this
court
is
bound
by
the
construction
placed
on
it
by
that
court.
that
happened
in
the
michigan,
another
obscenity
case
which
the
court
of
course
is
familiar
with
and
also
in
the
last
ginsberg
case.
now,
in
the
last
ginsberg
case,
the
new
york
statute
which
defined
knowledge
as
this,
the
word
“knowingly
possess
obscene
matter”.
the
new
york
statute
said
define
knowingly
as
having
general
knowledge
of
or
reason
to
know,
the
exact
same
words
that
were
in
the
georgia
statute
or
reasonably
should
know
or
a
belief
or
ground
for
belief
which
warrants
further
inspection
or
inquiry.
in
other
words,
in
the
ginsberg
case
and
that's
the
g-i-n-s-b-e-r-g
case,
being
two
ginsberg
cases
in
the
obscenity
field,
this
court
accepted
the
construction
placed
on
the
scienter
feature
of
the
new
york
statute
and
said
as
we
are
bound
to
do.
now,
the
georgia
supreme
court
said
in
response
to
mr.
asinof's
contention
that
the
language
of
the
georgia
statute
if
such
person
has
knowledge
or
reasonably
should
know
of
the
obscene
nature
of
the
matter,
does
not
remove
scienter
from
the
offense
but
is
merely
a
statutory
expression
of
a
rule
of
evidence
which
has
been
extent
in
georgia
courts
for
many
years.
that
is
the
only
way
you
can
prove
intent
or
knowledge
of
a
person
as
to
anything
as
to
whether
goods
are
stolen
or
any
element
involving
intent
or
knowledge
unless
he
confesses
is
by
the
circumstances
as
to
whether
a
reasonable
man
in
the
same
position
would
know
or
would
have
knowledge
of
the
obscene
nature.
so
we
submit
--
i
submit
very
respectfully
that
by
a
long
series
of
this
court's
own
decisions
that
you
cannot
go
beyond
or
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
georgia
supreme
court
on
this
question
of
scienter
because
that
is
the
state
court
interpreting
its
own
statute
and
i
have
cited
a
number
of
cases
where
this
court
has
said
that
we
are
bound
by
such
expression.
this
court
also
said
that
in
the
michigan
case,
you
said
in
the
kingsley
international
picture
corporation
case,
in
about
eight
cases,
aero
transit,
all
of
which
are
listed
in
our
brief.
so
that
moves
us
on
to
the
second
facet
of
the
attack
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
i
submit
most
earnestly
to
the
court
that
scienter
is
an
element
of
this
offense
as
interpreted
by
the
georgia
court,
by
the
georgia
supreme
court
and
if
this
court
cannot
unless
you
reverse
your
prior
rulings
which
are
set
out
in
our
brief
and
which
i
have
cited
to
you,
unless
you
reverse
that
long
line
of
cases,
i
don't
believe
the
court
could
in
keeping
with
his
precedent
just
say
we
think
the
georgia
court
was
wrong
and
i
said
that
this
does
not
--
that
the
statute
does
not
contain
the
element
of
scienter.
it's
almost
exact
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
the
state's
evidence
to
prove
scienter.
it
was
circumstantial
your
honor
but
we
think
that
it
was
sufficient.
these
officers
went
in
with
a
federal
search
warrant
to
seize
a
wagering
paraphernalia.
this
man
was
alleged
of
many
notorious
bookmaker,
whether
a
prior
record
of
arrest
and
a
conviction.
upstairs
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
that
wouldn't
have
any
connection
with
this
case
but
i
was
pointing
out
the
probable
cause
that
we
had
--
that
was
28
pages
of
probable
cause.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
one
of
the
cans
bears
the
label
“young
blood”
on
it,
which
is
certainly
is
suggestive
title.
it's
a
homemade
label.
i
gather
from
what
the
court
has
said
that
the
court
hasn't
viewed
these
films
that
are
here
and
i've
asked
the
court
about
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
alright
sir.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
well,
the
evidence
showed,
your
honor,
that
in
the
upstairs
living
room,
there
was
a
projector
set
up
and
a
bunch
of
innocuous
films,
slides,
travelogues,
things
like
that.
these
films
were
not
found
with
the
other
films,
the
innocuous
or
innocent
type
film
but
they
were
found
in
a
desk
drawer
underneath
some
papers
in
his
private
bedroom.
an
officer
--
the
officers
ran
them,
threw
them
against
the
wall,
and
then
went
downstairs
and
told
him,
says,
“we
are
arresting
you
for
the
obscene
films
which
we
found
upstairs.”
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
it
was
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
mr.
justice
marshall
i
think
that
they
wanted
to
look
at
the
films
for
the
reason
that
the
films
might
have
been
records,
they
were
authorized
to
look
for
bookmaking
records
and
it's
not
inconceivable
that
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
you
could,
just
like
the
old
“purloined
letter”
scheme,
edgar
allan
poe,
the
story
about
putting
something
in
the
most
conspicuous
place.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
no,
sir,
but
there
were
three
cans.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
they
didn't
show
all
three
of
them
your
honor.
the
record
shows
they
only
showed
a
few
feet
of
the
second
and
the
third
one.
in
fact,
one
of
the
films
that
have
rewound
backwards
which
shows
recent
viewing
and
the
pictures
were
thrown
upside
down.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
he
went
downstairs
and
met
the
defendant
and
told
the
defendant
that,
“i'm
arresting
you
for
those
obscene
films
upstairs.”
the
defendant
said
nothing.
of
course
i
don't
claim
you
can't
use
his
right
to
remain
silent
against
him.
that's
a
constitutional
right
but
it
would
still
seem
more
logical
to
say
what
films
if
you
didn't
know
that
he
had
any
obscene
films.
but
of
course
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
he
said
nothing.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
he
said,
“let
me
call
mr.
asinof.”
and
he
did
call
mr.
asinof.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
no,
sir,
but
they
were
his
own
statement.
he
made
a
statement
on
the
trial.
georgia
has
the
unsworn
statement
law
where
a
defendant
can
either
be
sworn
or
make
an
unsworn
statement.
this
is
what
he
said
and
while
it
is
not
any
admission,
it's
still
significant
i
think
it's
very
brief.
he
said,
“i'm
a
bachelor,
i
live
by
myself
and
i
have
a
girlfriend.
we
planned
a
party
for
labor
day.
i
invited
several
couples
out.
later
on
in
the
evening,
a
friend
of
mine
came
by
and
said
i
brought
you
something
i
want
you
to
see.
he
handed
it
to
me.
it
was
three
rolls
of
film.
i
took
the
film
upstairs
and
put
it
in
the
desk
drawer,
closed
the
desk
drawer,
and
came
back
downstairs.”
then
he
goes
on
to
say,
he
never
looked
at
it.
however,
there
were
--
two
people
were
in
the
backyard
when
the
officers
made
the
execution
of
the
search
warrant,
two
men.
three
women
came
over
later
that
evening
well-dressed
women.
there
was
justice
marshall's
three
dozen
biscuits
sitting
on
the
stove.
all
the
indications
were
that
there
was
going
to
be
a
party
and
in
fact
he
told
the
jury
that
he
was
going
to
have
a
party
and
in
the
connection,
the
context
of
his
statement
telling
about
the
party
first
and
a
friend
bringing
the
films
by
and
saying
“i
want
you
to
see
them,”
i
think
it's
a
reasonable
deduction
that
the
jury
could
have
drawn
that
these
three
films
were
to
be
shown
at
the
party.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
only
--
one
of
the
federal
agents
was
the
former
professional
photographer,
your
honor
and
he
had
--
he
testified
that
the
films
were
badly
scratched,
that
they
were
dirty,
that
one
of
the
films
had
been
wound
backwards
which
cause
the
figures
to
project
upside
down
on
the
wall
when
they
showed
it
and
he
said
that
they
had
obviously
been
used
before,
been
shown
before
many
times.
it
was
a
well
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
i'm
not
certain
whether
he
used
the
word
“many”
or
not.
i
know
that
he
said
that
they
had
obviously
been
shown
before,
that
they
had
seen
--
i
believe
he
said
he
had
seen
extensive
use.
i
could
find
that
for
you.
your
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
mr.
chief
justice
and
honorable
justices.
at
the
recess
yesterday
afternoon,
i
was
just
completing
my
response
to
a
question
by
--
questions
by
justice
douglas,
excuse
me
not
douglas,
brennan
as
to
the
evidence
of
scienter
and
i
have
practically
completed
my
summary
of
the
circumstances
which
we
feel
justified
the
jury
to
find
that
this
defendant
knew
of
the
obscene
nature
of
the
matter.
i
just
want
to
elaborate
any
one
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
that's
right,
the
contents
of
the
film,
that
he
knew
the
contents
of
the
film,
they
are
of
the
obscene
nature
of
the
film.
that
is
the
way
the
georgia
statute
reads
that,
i
believe.
i
just
want
to
point
out
two
things
in
relation
to
his
statement
and
i
will
move
on
to
something
else.
in
his
unsworn
statement,
he
attempted
to
explain
his
possession
of
the
films
in
a
manner
consistent
with
lack
of
knowledge
of
the
contents
and
i
submit
that
it
was
unreasonable
explanation,
some
point
unreasonable
in
two
respects.
first,
he
said
that
a
friend
brought
films
by
and
left
them
with
him
saying
that
he
wanted
the
appellant
to
view
the
films.
i
submit
that
it's
somewhat
unreasonable
that
films
would
have
exchanged
hands
without
some
explanation
on
the
part
of
the
unknown
friend,
or
some
query
on
the
part
of
the
appellant
as
to
what
kind
of
films
are
they,
particularly
the
small
eight
millimeter
films
in
the
can
with
a
homemade
label.
i
feel
quite
sure
that
if
anyone
came
to
me
and
said
i've
got
some
films
i
want
you
to
see,
i'd
say,
“what
are
they?
films
of
your
fishing
trip,
or
your
family
or
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
then
i
think
you
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
i
think
that
would
warrant
further
inquiry,
justice
white.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
evidence
because,
of
course,
this
was
an
unsworn
statement
and
the
state
was
not
allowed
to
cross-examine
or
go
into
it
without
his
consent
unless
he
voluntarily
submitted
himself
to
cross-examination.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
sir?
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes
sir,
the
state
has
the
burden
of
proof,
your
honor.
but
i
think
this
is
both
federal
and
state
law
as
i
recall
from
my
days
as
an
assistant
u.s.
attorney,
that
where
the
defense
goes
ahead
with
the
an
affirmative
defense,
then
not
the
burden
of
proof
but
the
burden
of
reason
--
of
making
a
reasonable
explanation
shifts
to
the
defendant
and
that
leads
me
to
my
next
point
and
that
is
that
if
he
did
not
identify
his
friend.
he
did
not
--
he
neither
produced
him
nor
identified
him
by
name.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
sir,
that
is
true.
and
i
want
to
point
in
that
connection
before
passing
this
subject,
the
case
of
smith
versus
california
which
this
court
decided
and
which
the
defendant
was
convicted
for
the
offense
of
bare
possession
of
matters
under
california
ordinance
which
had
no
element
of
scienter
is
interpreted
by
the
california
supreme
court
and
the
court
said
in
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
might
observe
that
it
has
been
sometimes
since
the
law
viewed
itself
as
impotent
to
explore
the
actual
state
of
a
man's
mind,
eyewitness
testimony
of
a
bookseller's
perusal
of
a
book
hardly
need
be
a
necessary
element
in
proving
his
awareness
of
its
contents.
the
circumstances
may
warrant
the
inference
that
he
was
well
aware
of
what
a
book
contained
despite
his
denial
and
i
submit
that
those
quoted
words
are
a
pretty
analogous
to
the
facts
in
this
case.
we
are
relying
on
the
circumstances.
we
have
no
direct
evidence
that
he
saw,
that
he
knew
what
the
films
were
but
we
submit
that
all
the
circumstances,
the
impending
party,
the
films
concealed,
the
title
“young
blood”
is
rather
inadequate
explanation.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
well,
i
think
it
suggests
sex,
your
honor.
we
normally
associate
sex
with
young
blood,
with
young
people.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
i
want
to
pass
on
to
another
point.
i
gathered
yesterday
from
the
questions
asked
my
worthy
adversary,
mr.
asinof,
that
this
court
has
not
yet
viewed
the
contents
of
the
film,
which
were
transmitted
to
this
court
by
the
direction
of
the
georgia
supreme
court.
i
wish
to
most
respectfully
and
humbly
urge
this
court
to
view
the
films
before
ruling
on
the
case.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
i
was
fixing
--
that
was
going
to
be
my
very
next
statement
as
to
the
legal
reason
why
i
feel
that
the
films
should
be
viewed.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
sir.
i
do
for
this
reason.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
this
court
or
the
majority
of
this
court
has
consistently
held
in
obscenity
cases
from
roth
on
through
jacobellis,
mishkin,
ginsberg,
memoirs,
even
redrup
i
believe
and
the
last
ginsberg
in
1968
that
obscenity
is
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution.
and
if
the
court
views
these
films
and
finds
that
they
are
not
only
--
they
are
not
borderline
obscenity
but
a
hard-core
pornography
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
you
should
not
reach
the
first
amendment
question.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
oh!
no,
sir,
but
i'm
not
saying
that.
i
think
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
am
not
absolutely
certain
justice
stewart
that
the
search
and
seizure.
the
question
is
actually
before
this
court.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
oh!
mr.
fortas,
excuse
me,
i'm
sorry.
search
and
seizure
is
not
an
appealable
question.
the
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction
without
restricting
the
question
to
the
only
appealable
question
which
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
georgia's
search
and
seizure,
i
mean
the
constitutionality
of
the
georgia
obscenity
act.
and
the
same
thing
happened
in
the
mishkin
case
and
the
court
dismissed.
they
said
that
the
search
and
seizure
question
was
properly
briefed
by
both
parties
but
then
are
declined
to
pass
on
it
and
said
that
probable
jurisdiction
had
been
erroneously
noted
as
far
as
that's
concerned.
however,
i
do
feel
that
the
court
would
have
to
pass
on
the
search
and
seizure
question
but
right
now,
i'm
addressing
myself
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
georgia
statute.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
i
disagree
with
it
your
honor,
so
far
as
the
first
amendment.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
well,
your
honor
i
feel
that
the
possession
is
the
first
amendment.
and
maybe
the
possession
is
the
first
amendment
point,
in
the
sense
but
not
in
the
sense
that
you're
talking
about
i
take
it.
i'm
talking
about
the
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
the
appellant
is
asking
this
court
to
declare
a
mere
possession
count
as
a
mere
possession
with
scienter
count
unconstitutional.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
your
honor
i
take
the
reverse
position.
and
i've
said
that
you
should
see
the
films
and
if
they
are
hard-core
pornography
and
outside
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment
as
this
court
has
held
in
roth
and
a
whole
series
of
cases,
then
it
would
not
be
necessary
for
the
court
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
that's
an
understatement,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
that's
what
i
mean.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
sir,
that's
going
to
be
my
next
point.
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
in
research
and
i
believe
my
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
that
is
the
only
evidence
that
it
has
been
displayed
in
atlanta.
i
recall
that
your
honor
asked
me
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes
sir,
you're
right.
thank
you.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
they
looked
at
it
in
the
appellant's
home
and
yesterday,
justice
black,
you
asked
me
about
the
--
what
the
expert
photographer
said.
he
said
that
the
films
are
badly
scratched,
and
dirty.
they
are
not
in
new
condition
at
all.
that's
where
mistakenly
said
that
they
had
seen
extensive
use.
one
reel
rolled
backward
and
never
rewound
after
showing
the
film.
and
he
says,
“yes,
sir,
they
obviously
have
been
shown
before.”
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
that's
true,
sir,
your
honor.
we
didn't
have
any
eyewitness
who
watched
this
appellant
show
the
films.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
that
was
not
the
evidence,
your
honor.
it
was
in
the
form
of
an
unsworn
statement.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
sir,
under
georgia
law,
the
court
--
the
jury
can
pay
what
attention
to
it
wants
to.it
can
either
disregard
it
or
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
i'm
suggesting
that
the
court
should
consider
it,
and
consider
its
deficiencies.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
well,
i
don't
--
i'm
not
saying
that
the
court
should
believe
it
all
in
its
entirety
because
the
natural
thing
for
him
to
have
done
was
that
was
that
if
that
was
true,
they
have
brought
the
person
in
court
or
at
least
named
him,
so
that
the
prosecution
could've
brought
him
into
court.
i
have
only
a
couple
of
minutes
left
and
i
haven't
even
addressed
myself
to
the
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
it's
entirely
possibly
unless
he
denied.
he
might
have
said,
“no,
sir.
i
don't
know
bob
stanley,
never
say
him
before,
and
certainly,
i
didn't
give
him
any
films.”
then
we
would
have
made
a
state's
witness
out
of
him
to
and
proven
that
the
defendant
made
a
false
statement
in
his
unsworn
statement.
on
the
question
of
which
justice
harlan
asked
me
to
address
myself
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
possession
statute,
i
really
see
no
reason
why
a
possession
statute
are
making
hard-core
pornography
obscene
cannot
be
constitutionally
enacted
by
state.
states
have
many
possession
statutes
and
the
court
knows
them
as
well
as
that
of
possession
of
stolen
goods,
possession
of
concealed
weapons
without
being
--
without
having
licenses
for
them,
possession
of
narcotics,
possession
of
dangerous
drugs,
possession
of
burglary
tools.
the
federal
government
has
many
possession
statutes,
possession
of
a
car,
transported
or
stolen
car
transported
in
interstate
commerce,
possession
of
money
taken
in
an
fdic
bank
robbery,
many
possession
statutes.
and
even
during
prohibition
days,
possession
of
--
bare
possession
of
intoxicating
liquors
of
any
type
was
an
offense.
and
i
see
no
reason
for
the
possession
of
hard-core
pornography
should
not
be
made
an
offense
and
i
know
of
no
case
which
--
i
think
this
is
a
case
of
first
impression
before
this
court.
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
a
case
exactly
in
point.
now,
in
the
smith
case,
which
this
court
admittedly
reversed,
but
only
because
there
was
no
scienter,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
opinion
which
i've
quoted
from
once
before
indicates
or
implies
that
had
the
california
ordinance
had
the
element
of
scienter
in
it
that
it
would've
been
constitutional
because
mr.
justice
brennan
said
this.
we
need
not
and
most
definitely
do
not
pass
today
on
what
sort
of
mental
element
is
requisite
to
a
constitutionally
permissible
prosecution
of
a
bookseller
quoting
“for
carrying
an
obscene
book
in
stock.”
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
that
is
the
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
sir.
but,
your
honor,
the
california
ordinance
did
not
have
any
element
of
carrying
it
in
stock
for
sale.
it
just
said
possession,
absolute
liability,
absolute
criminal
liability.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
it
did
involve
a
bookseller.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
and
i
cannot
see,
honestly,
where
the
first
amendment
grounds
hit
this
particular
case.
this
man
is
not
a
bookseller.
he
was
suspected
of
being
a
bookmaker
rather
than
a
bookseller.
now,
he
was
not
intending
to
sell
these
films
so
far
as
the
available
evidence
indicates.
the
general
public
was
not
deprived
of
the
right
to
look
at
the
films.
the
georgia
supreme
court,
in
distinguishing
this
case
from
the
marcus
case,
said
as
much
in
its
opinion.
it
said
that
the
marcus
case
on
the
search
warrant
marcus
versus
search
warrant.
it
said
that
that
case
involves
freedom
of
the
press
and
freedom
of
speech.
this
case
does
not
and
i
don't
think
this
case
involves
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
this
is
just
an
individual.
he
is
not
being
deprived
of
his
right,
though
the
public
i
should
say
is
not
being
deprived
of
the
right
to
view
his
films.
i
see
i
have
the
red
light.
if
i
might
just
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
i
might
just
say
this
if
i
might
be
allowed
one
more
sentence.
i
feel
that
that
is
--
in
the
possession
statute
is
necessary
for
effective
law
enforcement
from
the
very
type
of
evidentiary
problems
which
have
been
pointed
out
by
questions
from
this
court.
if
you
catch
a
man
with
the
pornographic
material,
how
are
you
going
to
prove
that
he
has
read
or
he
has
looked
at
it,
or
that
he
intends
to
sell
it?
you
can
stop
pornography
at
its
source
and
i
earnestly
submit
that
this
is
the
hardest
type
of
hard-core
pornography
that
this
court
have
ever
had
before.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
if
it
please
the
court.
i
am
the
trial
counsel
who
prosecuted
this
case
in
the
court
below,
the
superior
court
of
fulton
county.
so
the
court
has
original
trial
counsel.
mr.
asinof
was
a
defense
counsel.
now,
i
want
to
point
out
several
things
to
the
court
which
i
think
mr.
asinof
neglected
to
point
out
because
he
was
so
wrapped
up
in
his
own
argument.
one
is
this,
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
georgia
statute
contains
the
element
of
scienter.
i
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
ruled
on
that
in
this
very
case.
the
court
said,
i'm
just
reading
in
part,
just
a
line.
it's
contended
that
being
contended
that
the
requirement
of
reasonable
knowledge
would
withdraw
the
element
of
scienter
from
the
definition
of
the
offense
and
would
render
a
person
guilty
without
actual
knowledge
of
the
obscene
nature
of
the
matter.
this
contention
is
without
merit.
now,
your
honor,
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
where
a
state
statute
is
interpreted
by
the
highest
court
of
its
state,
that
this
court
is
bound
by
the
construction
placed
on
it
by
that
court.
that
happened
in
the
michigan,
another
obscenity
case
which
the
court
of
course
is
familiar
with
and
also
in
the
last
ginsberg
case.
now,
in
the
last
ginsberg
case,
the
new
york
statute
which
defined
knowledge
as
this,
the
word
“knowingly
possess
obscene
matter”.
the
new
york
statute
said
define
knowingly
as
having
general
knowledge
of
or
reason
to
know,
the
exact
same
words
that
were
in
the
georgia
statute
or
reasonably
should
know
or
a
belief
or
ground
for
belief
which
warrants
further
inspection
or
inquiry.
in
other
words,
in
the
ginsberg
case
and
that's
the
g-i-n-s-b-e-r-g
case,
being
two
ginsberg
cases
in
the
obscenity
field,
this
court
accepted
the
construction
placed
on
the
scienter
feature
of
the
new
york
statute
and
said
as
we
are
bound
to
do.
now,
the
georgia
supreme
court
said
in
response
to
mr.
asinof's
contention
that
the
language
of
the
georgia
statute
if
such
person
has
knowledge
or
reasonably
should
know
of
the
obscene
nature
of
the
matter,
does
not
remove
scienter
from
the
offense
but
is
merely
a
statutory
expression
of
a
rule
of
evidence
which
has
been
extent
in
georgia
courts
for
many
years.
that
is
the
only
way
you
can
prove
intent
or
knowledge
of
a
person
as
to
anything
as
to
whether
goods
are
stolen
or
any
element
involving
intent
or
knowledge
unless
he
confesses
is
by
the
circumstances
as
to
whether
a
reasonable
man
in
the
same
position
would
know
or
would
have
knowledge
of
the
obscene
nature.
so
we
submit
--
i
submit
very
respectfully
that
by
a
long
series
of
this
court's
own
decisions
that
you
cannot
go
beyond
or
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
georgia
supreme
court
on
this
question
of
scienter
because
that
is
the
state
court
interpreting
its
own
statute
and
i
have
cited
a
number
of
cases
where
this
court
has
said
that
we
are
bound
by
such
expression.
this
court
also
said
that
in
the
michigan
case,
you
said
in
the
kingsley
international
picture
corporation
case,
in
about
eight
cases,
aero
transit,
all
of
which
are
listed
in
our
brief.
so
that
moves
us
on
to
the
second
facet
of
the
attack
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
i
submit
most
earnestly
to
the
court
that
scienter
is
an
element
of
this
offense
as
interpreted
by
the
georgia
court,
by
the
georgia
supreme
court
and
if
this
court
cannot
unless
you
reverse
your
prior
rulings
which
are
set
out
in
our
brief
and
which
i
have
cited
to
you,
unless
you
reverse
that
long
line
of
cases,
i
don't
believe
the
court
could
in
keeping
with
his
precedent
just
say
we
think
the
georgia
court
was
wrong
and
i
said
that
this
does
not
--
that
the
statute
does
not
contain
the
element
of
scienter.
it's
almost
exact
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
the
state's
evidence
to
prove
scienter.
it
was
circumstantial
your
honor
but
we
think
that
it
was
sufficient.
these
officers
went
in
with
a
federal
search
warrant
to
seize
a
wagering
paraphernalia.
this
man
was
alleged
of
many
notorious
bookmaker,
whether
a
prior
record
of
arrest
and
a
conviction.
upstairs
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
that
wouldn't
have
any
connection
with
this
case
but
i
was
pointing
out
the
probable
cause
that
we
had
--
that
was
28
pages
of
probable
cause.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
one
of
the
cans
bears
the
label
“young
blood”
on
it,
which
is
certainly
is
suggestive
title.
it's
a
homemade
label.
i
gather
from
what
the
court
has
said
that
the
court
hasn't
viewed
these
films
that
are
here
and
i've
asked
the
court
about
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
alright
sir.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
well,
the
evidence
showed,
your
honor,
that
in
the
upstairs
living
room,
there
was
a
projector
set
up
and
a
bunch
of
innocuous
films,
slides,
travelogues,
things
like
that.
these
films
were
not
found
with
the
other
films,
the
innocuous
or
innocent
type
film
but
they
were
found
in
a
desk
drawer
underneath
some
papers
in
his
private
bedroom.
an
officer
--
the
officers
ran
them,
threw
them
against
the
wall,
and
then
went
downstairs
and
told
him,
says,
“we
are
arresting
you
for
the
obscene
films
which
we
found
upstairs.”
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
it
was
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
mr.
justice
marshall
i
think
that
they
wanted
to
look
at
the
films
for
the
reason
that
the
films
might
have
been
records,
they
were
authorized
to
look
for
bookmaking
records
and
it's
not
inconceivable
that
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
you
could,
just
like
the
old
“purloined
letter”
scheme,
edgar
allan
poe,
the
story
about
putting
something
in
the
most
conspicuous
place.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
no,
sir,
but
there
were
three
cans.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
they
didn't
show
all
three
of
them
your
honor.
the
record
shows
they
only
showed
a
few
feet
of
the
second
and
the
third
one.
in
fact,
one
of
the
films
that
have
rewound
backwards
which
shows
recent
viewing
and
the
pictures
were
thrown
upside
down.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
he
went
downstairs
and
met
the
defendant
and
told
the
defendant
that,
“i'm
arresting
you
for
those
obscene
films
upstairs.”
the
defendant
said
nothing.
of
course
i
don't
claim
you
can't
use
his
right
to
remain
silent
against
him.
that's
a
constitutional
right
but
it
would
still
seem
more
logical
to
say
what
films
if
you
didn't
know
that
he
had
any
obscene
films.
but
of
course
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
he
said
nothing.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
he
said,
“let
me
call
mr.
asinof.”
and
he
did
call
mr.
asinof.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
no,
sir,
but
they
were
his
own
statement.
he
made
a
statement
on
the
trial.
georgia
has
the
unsworn
statement
law
where
a
defendant
can
either
be
sworn
or
make
an
unsworn
statement.
this
is
what
he
said
and
while
it
is
not
any
admission,
it's
still
significant
i
think
it's
very
brief.
he
said,
“i'm
a
bachelor,
i
live
by
myself
and
i
have
a
girlfriend.
we
planned
a
party
for
labor
day.
i
invited
several
couples
out.
later
on
in
the
evening,
a
friend
of
mine
came
by
and
said
i
brought
you
something
i
want
you
to
see.
he
handed
it
to
me.
it
was
three
rolls
of
film.
i
took
the
film
upstairs
and
put
it
in
the
desk
drawer,
closed
the
desk
drawer,
and
came
back
downstairs.”
then
he
goes
on
to
say,
he
never
looked
at
it.
however,
there
were
--
two
people
were
in
the
backyard
when
the
officers
made
the
execution
of
the
search
warrant,
two
men.
three
women
came
over
later
that
evening
well-dressed
women.
there
was
justice
marshall's
three
dozen
biscuits
sitting
on
the
stove.
all
the
indications
were
that
there
was
going
to
be
a
party
and
in
fact
he
told
the
jury
that
he
was
going
to
have
a
party
and
in
the
connection,
the
context
of
his
statement
telling
about
the
party
first
and
a
friend
bringing
the
films
by
and
saying
“i
want
you
to
see
them,”
i
think
it's
a
reasonable
deduction
that
the
jury
could
have
drawn
that
these
three
films
were
to
be
shown
at
the
party.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
only
--
one
of
the
federal
agents
was
the
former
professional
photographer,
your
honor
and
he
had
--
he
testified
that
the
films
were
badly
scratched,
that
they
were
dirty,
that
one
of
the
films
had
been
wound
backwards
which
cause
the
figures
to
project
upside
down
on
the
wall
when
they
showed
it
and
he
said
that
they
had
obviously
been
used
before,
been
shown
before
many
times.
it
was
a
well
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
i'm
not
certain
whether
he
used
the
word
“many”
or
not.
i
know
that
he
said
that
they
had
obviously
been
shown
before,
that
they
had
seen
--
i
believe
he
said
he
had
seen
extensive
use.
i
could
find
that
for
you.
your
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
mr.
chief
justice
and
honorable
justices.
at
the
recess
yesterday
afternoon,
i
was
just
completing
my
response
to
a
question
by
--
questions
by
justice
douglas,
excuse
me
not
douglas,
brennan
as
to
the
evidence
of
scienter
and
i
have
practically
completed
my
summary
of
the
circumstances
which
we
feel
justified
the
jury
to
find
that
this
defendant
knew
of
the
obscene
nature
of
the
matter.
i
just
want
to
elaborate
any
one
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
that's
right,
the
contents
of
the
film,
that
he
knew
the
contents
of
the
film,
they
are
of
the
obscene
nature
of
the
film.
that
is
the
way
the
georgia
statute
reads
that,
i
believe.
i
just
want
to
point
out
two
things
in
relation
to
his
statement
and
i
will
move
on
to
something
else.
in
his
unsworn
statement,
he
attempted
to
explain
his
possession
of
the
films
in
a
manner
consistent
with
lack
of
knowledge
of
the
contents
and
i
submit
that
it
was
unreasonable
explanation,
some
point
unreasonable
in
two
respects.
first,
he
said
that
a
friend
brought
films
by
and
left
them
with
him
saying
that
he
wanted
the
appellant
to
view
the
films.
i
submit
that
it's
somewhat
unreasonable
that
films
would
have
exchanged
hands
without
some
explanation
on
the
part
of
the
unknown
friend,
or
some
query
on
the
part
of
the
appellant
as
to
what
kind
of
films
are
they,
particularly
the
small
eight
millimeter
films
in
the
can
with
a
homemade
label.
i
feel
quite
sure
that
if
anyone
came
to
me
and
said
i've
got
some
films
i
want
you
to
see,
i'd
say,
“what
are
they?
films
of
your
fishing
trip,
or
your
family
or
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
then
i
think
you
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
i
think
that
would
warrant
further
inquiry,
justice
white.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
evidence
because,
of
course,
this
was
an
unsworn
statement
and
the
state
was
not
allowed
to
cross-examine
or
go
into
it
without
his
consent
unless
he
voluntarily
submitted
himself
to
cross-examination.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
sir?
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes
sir,
the
state
has
the
burden
of
proof,
your
honor.
but
i
think
this
is
both
federal
and
state
law
as
i
recall
from
my
days
as
an
assistant
u.s.
attorney,
that
where
the
defense
goes
ahead
with
the
an
affirmative
defense,
then
not
the
burden
of
proof
but
the
burden
of
reason
--
of
making
a
reasonable
explanation
shifts
to
the
defendant
and
that
leads
me
to
my
next
point
and
that
is
that
if
he
did
not
identify
his
friend.
he
did
not
--
he
neither
produced
him
nor
identified
him
by
name.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
sir,
that
is
true.
and
i
want
to
point
in
that
connection
before
passing
this
subject,
the
case
of
smith
versus
california
which
this
court
decided
and
which
the
defendant
was
convicted
for
the
offense
of
bare
possession
of
matters
under
california
ordinance
which
had
no
element
of
scienter
is
interpreted
by
the
california
supreme
court
and
the
court
said
in
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
might
observe
that
it
has
been
sometimes
since
the
law
viewed
itself
as
impotent
to
explore
the
actual
state
of
a
man's
mind,
eyewitness
testimony
of
a
bookseller's
perusal
of
a
book
hardly
need
be
a
necessary
element
in
proving
his
awareness
of
its
contents.
the
circumstances
may
warrant
the
inference
that
he
was
well
aware
of
what
a
book
contained
despite
his
denial
and
i
submit
that
those
quoted
words
are
a
pretty
analogous
to
the
facts
in
this
case.
we
are
relying
on
the
circumstances.
we
have
no
direct
evidence
that
he
saw,
that
he
knew
what
the
films
were
but
we
submit
that
all
the
circumstances,
the
impending
party,
the
films
concealed,
the
title
“young
blood”
is
rather
inadequate
explanation.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
well,
i
think
it
suggests
sex,
your
honor.
we
normally
associate
sex
with
young
blood,
with
young
people.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
i
want
to
pass
on
to
another
point.
i
gathered
yesterday
from
the
questions
asked
my
worthy
adversary,
mr.
asinof,
that
this
court
has
not
yet
viewed
the
contents
of
the
film,
which
were
transmitted
to
this
court
by
the
direction
of
the
georgia
supreme
court.
i
wish
to
most
respectfully
and
humbly
urge
this
court
to
view
the
films
before
ruling
on
the
case.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
i
was
fixing
--
that
was
going
to
be
my
very
next
statement
as
to
the
legal
reason
why
i
feel
that
the
films
should
be
viewed.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
sir.
i
do
for
this
reason.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
this
court
or
the
majority
of
this
court
has
consistently
held
in
obscenity
cases
from
roth
on
through
jacobellis,
mishkin,
ginsberg,
memoirs,
even
redrup
i
believe
and
the
last
ginsberg
in
1968
that
obscenity
is
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution.
and
if
the
court
views
these
films
and
finds
that
they
are
not
only
--
they
are
not
borderline
obscenity
but
a
hard-core
pornography
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
you
should
not
reach
the
first
amendment
question.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
oh!
no,
sir,
but
i'm
not
saying
that.
i
think
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
am
not
absolutely
certain
justice
stewart
that
the
search
and
seizure.
the
question
is
actually
before
this
court.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
oh!
mr.
fortas,
excuse
me,
i'm
sorry.
search
and
seizure
is
not
an
appealable
question.
the
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction
without
restricting
the
question
to
the
only
appealable
question
which
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
georgia's
search
and
seizure,
i
mean
the
constitutionality
of
the
georgia
obscenity
act.
and
the
same
thing
happened
in
the
mishkin
case
and
the
court
dismissed.
they
said
that
the
search
and
seizure
question
was
properly
briefed
by
both
parties
but
then
are
declined
to
pass
on
it
and
said
that
probable
jurisdiction
had
been
erroneously
noted
as
far
as
that's
concerned.
however,
i
do
feel
that
the
court
would
have
to
pass
on
the
search
and
seizure
question
but
right
now,
i'm
addressing
myself
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
georgia
statute.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
i
disagree
with
it
your
honor,
so
far
as
the
first
amendment.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
well,
your
honor
i
feel
that
the
possession
is
the
first
amendment.
and
maybe
the
possession
is
the
first
amendment
point,
in
the
sense
but
not
in
the
sense
that
you're
talking
about
i
take
it.
i'm
talking
about
the
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
the
appellant
is
asking
this
court
to
declare
a
mere
possession
count
as
a
mere
possession
with
scienter
count
unconstitutional.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
your
honor
i
take
the
reverse
position.
and
i've
said
that
you
should
see
the
films
and
if
they
are
hard-core
pornography
and
outside
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment
as
this
court
has
held
in
roth
and
a
whole
series
of
cases,
then
it
would
not
be
necessary
for
the
court
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
that's
an
understatement,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
that's
what
i
mean.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
sir,
that's
going
to
be
my
next
point.
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
in
research
and
i
believe
my
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
that
is
the
only
evidence
that
it
has
been
displayed
in
atlanta.
i
recall
that
your
honor
asked
me
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes
sir,
you're
right.
thank
you.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
they
looked
at
it
in
the
appellant's
home
and
yesterday,
justice
black,
you
asked
me
about
the
--
what
the
expert
photographer
said.
he
said
that
the
films
are
badly
scratched,
and
dirty.
they
are
not
in
new
condition
at
all.
that's
where
mistakenly
said
that
they
had
seen
extensive
use.
one
reel
rolled
backward
and
never
rewound
after
showing
the
film.
and
he
says,
“yes,
sir,
they
obviously
have
been
shown
before.”
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
that's
true,
sir,
your
honor.
we
didn't
have
any
eyewitness
who
watched
this
appellant
show
the
films.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
that
was
not
the
evidence,
your
honor.
it
was
in
the
form
of
an
unsworn
statement.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
sir,
under
georgia
law,
the
court
--
the
jury
can
pay
what
attention
to
it
wants
to.it
can
either
disregard
it
or
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
i'm
suggesting
that
the
court
should
consider
it,
and
consider
its
deficiencies.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
well,
i
don't
--
i'm
not
saying
that
the
court
should
believe
it
all
in
its
entirety
because
the
natural
thing
for
him
to
have
done
was
that
was
that
if
that
was
true,
they
have
brought
the
person
in
court
or
at
least
named
him,
so
that
the
prosecution
could've
brought
him
into
court.
i
have
only
a
couple
of
minutes
left
and
i
haven't
even
addressed
myself
to
the
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
it's
entirely
possibly
unless
he
denied.
he
might
have
said,
“no,
sir.
i
don't
know
bob
stanley,
never
say
him
before,
and
certainly,
i
didn't
give
him
any
films.”
then
we
would
have
made
a
state's
witness
out
of
him
to
and
proven
that
the
defendant
made
a
false
statement
in
his
unsworn
statement.
on
the
question
of
which
justice
harlan
asked
me
to
address
myself
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
possession
statute,
i
really
see
no
reason
why
a
possession
statute
are
making
hard-core
pornography
obscene
cannot
be
constitutionally
enacted
by
state.
states
have
many
possession
statutes
and
the
court
knows
them
as
well
as
that
of
possession
of
stolen
goods,
possession
of
concealed
weapons
without
being
--
without
having
licenses
for
them,
possession
of
narcotics,
possession
of
dangerous
drugs,
possession
of
burglary
tools.
the
federal
government
has
many
possession
statutes,
possession
of
a
car,
transported
or
stolen
car
transported
in
interstate
commerce,
possession
of
money
taken
in
an
fdic
bank
robbery,
many
possession
statutes.
and
even
during
prohibition
days,
possession
of
--
bare
possession
of
intoxicating
liquors
of
any
type
was
an
offense.
and
i
see
no
reason
for
the
possession
of
hard-core
pornography
should
not
be
made
an
offense
and
i
know
of
no
case
which
--
i
think
this
is
a
case
of
first
impression
before
this
court.
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
a
case
exactly
in
point.
now,
in
the
smith
case,
which
this
court
admittedly
reversed,
but
only
because
there
was
no
scienter,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
opinion
which
i've
quoted
from
once
before
indicates
or
implies
that
had
the
california
ordinance
had
the
element
of
scienter
in
it
that
it
would've
been
constitutional
because
mr.
justice
brennan
said
this.
we
need
not
and
most
definitely
do
not
pass
today
on
what
sort
of
mental
element
is
requisite
to
a
constitutionally
permissible
prosecution
of
a
bookseller
quoting
“for
carrying
an
obscene
book
in
stock.”
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
that
is
the
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
sir.
but,
your
honor,
the
california
ordinance
did
not
have
any
element
of
carrying
it
in
stock
for
sale.
it
just
said
possession,
absolute
liability,
absolute
criminal
liability.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
it
did
involve
a
bookseller.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
and
i
cannot
see,
honestly,
where
the
first
amendment
grounds
hit
this
particular
case.
this
man
is
not
a
bookseller.
he
was
suspected
of
being
a
bookmaker
rather
than
a
bookseller.
now,
he
was
not
intending
to
sell
these
films
so
far
as
the
available
evidence
indicates.
the
general
public
was
not
deprived
of
the
right
to
look
at
the
films.
the
georgia
supreme
court,
in
distinguishing
this
case
from
the
marcus
case,
said
as
much
in
its
opinion.
it
said
that
the
marcus
case
on
the
search
warrant
marcus
versus
search
warrant.
it
said
that
that
case
involves
freedom
of
the
press
and
freedom
of
speech.
this
case
does
not
and
i
don't
think
this
case
involves
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
this
is
just
an
individual.
he
is
not
being
deprived
of
his
right,
though
the
public
i
should
say
is
not
being
deprived
of
the
right
to
view
his
films.
i
see
i
have
the
red
light.
if
i
might
just
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
i
might
just
say
this
if
i
might
be
allowed
one
more
sentence.
i
feel
that
that
is
--
in
the
possession
statute
is
necessary
for
effective
law
enforcement
from
the
very
type
of
evidentiary
problems
which
have
been
pointed
out
by
questions
from
this
court.
if
you
catch
a
man
with
the
pornographic
material,
how
are
you
going
to
prove
that
he
has
read
or
he
has
looked
at
it,
or
that
he
intends
to
sell
it?
you
can
stop
pornography
at
its
source
and
i
earnestly
submit
that
this
is
the
hardest
type
of
hard-core
pornography
that
this
court
have
ever
had
before.
thank
you
very
much.
