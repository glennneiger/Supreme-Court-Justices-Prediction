that
even

to
actually
look

what's
in

justice

do
you
take
that
argument?
justice

according
to
another
argument,
he
wasn't

entitled

look
at

justice

assume
as
you

you

looking

justice

they
ran

i
take
it?
justice
byron

white
you
aren't
arguing
that,
are
you
that
he
knew
it
was
obscene?
you're
just
arguing
that
he
knew
the
contents
of
the
film?
justice
byron

white
what
if
you
asked
him
and
said,
“they
are
films
about

justice
byron

(inaudible)
and
would
you
know,
or
would
you
have
any
real
clue,
that
they
were
obscene
films?

that
may

what
evidence
is
there
that
there
was
ever
any
further

what
the
films
were
about?
justice

the

the

the
undisputed
evidence
was
that

appellant

come
into

that
very
day.
justice
byron

well,
you've
been
talking
about
it,
though,
as
the
basis
for
much
of
your
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
we
should
disregard
that
statement
entirely?
justice
byron

white
well,
if
we
do
then
we
know
that
he
had
barely
come
into
possession
of
the
films?”
justice

give
me
your
view
of
how
you
would
argue
the
possession
point,
accepting
the
fact
that
the
court
has
said
that
that
obscenity
is
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
but
the
case
that
the
obscenity
isn't
in
the
first
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
obscenity
in
the
course
of
distribution
is
not
protected?
and
obscenity
in
possession
is
protected?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
material
doesn't
change
any,
so
what
is
the
critical
fact?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
material
whether
it's
distributed
or
not
is
the
same
and
it
is
either
is
or
isn't
protected
by
the
first
amendment
so
what
is
different
between
possession
and
distribution?
justice

should
you
really
focus
on?
