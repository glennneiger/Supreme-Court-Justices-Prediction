justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
when
these
films
were
in
a
desk
drawer,
weren't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
could
be
as
looking
at
the
film,
he
couldn't
tell
it
were?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
did
the
officers
do?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
trying
to
get
to
this.did
the
officers
use
a
projector
to
see
the
films?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
and
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
tell
me,
suppose
instead
of
these
films,
they
found
counterfeit
bills,
couldn't
this
fellow
have
been
prosecuted
for
possession
of
counterfeit
bills?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
do
you
distinguish
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it
harris,
--
with
harris
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
prosecution
and
the
actual
trial
for
possession
of
these
films,
was
there
any
effort
--
would
this
prove
that
the
possession
of
the
films
was
for
the
purpose
of
sale?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
was
just
naked
possession
of
the
film.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
any
claim
that
this
party
was
going
to
include
the
showing
of
these
films.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
i
understood
you
to
say,
neither
screen
nor
projector
was
set
up.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
films
were
in
cans
in
the
desk
drawer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
say
the
claim
--
was
there
any
effort
at
the
trial
to
show
that
he
was
going
to
have
a
party
including
showing
these
films?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
even
to
show
them
(voice
overlap)
was
nothing
as
i
understand
you.
there's
nothing
to
indicate
except
that
he
had
them
in
the
drawer
and
he
had
them
on
the
closet,
he
had
a
projector
and
a
screen.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
may
be
he
wasn't
going
to
show
them
at
all.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you're
--
i
take
it
you're
relying
on
marcus.
you're
relying
on
marcus?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
course
marcus
involves
as
i
recall
it
isn't
it,
a
warehouse
full
of
books
which
there
were
six
or
seven
that
the
police
have
purchased
and
there
on
the
basis
of
police
examination
of
the
books,
they
issued
the
warrant.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
we
said
that
they
have
to
have
a
determination
offense
but
it's
a
little
different.
here
you
have
just
a
single
item,
just
how
would
you
get
the
film
to
have
a
determination
of
obscenity
before
a
search
warrant
is
issued.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
facts?
he
definitely
takes
the
films.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
were
these
movies
shown
at
the
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
jury
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
they
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
don't
have
that
case
here,
why
argue
that
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
you
have
here
as
i
understand
it
assuming
the
obscenity
of
these
films,
a
question
whether
the
possession
and
nothing
more
not
for
sale
or
otherwise
but
just
possession
of
itself
constitutionally
can
make
a
crime
under
the
first
amendment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
that
what
it
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
anything
in
this
record
to
show
that
he
had
any
knowledge
of
what
these
films
were?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
state's
evidence
on
scienter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
interested
in
how
you
brought
evidence
and
what
evidence
there
was
upon
which
the
jury
could
find
that
he
knew
the
contents
of
these
motion
pictures.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'd
still
like
to
know
if
you
don't
mind.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
the
evidence
was
that
brought
home
to
him
knowledge
of
the
contents
of
those
movies?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
you're
going
to
tell
us
that
he
went
downstairs
and
i
gather
you
are
going
to
tell
us
he
met
the
defendant,
the
officer
did?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
why
he
said
nothing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
else
have
we
got?
the
officer
said
that
he
was
arrested
for
those
obscene
films,
the
defendant
said
nothing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
does
the
fact
that
he
called
his
lawyer,
does
that
indicate
that
he
knew
what
those
films
were?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
there
anything
in
what
you've
told
us
that
support
an
inference
that
he
had
looked
to
the
film
and
knew
what
they
were?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
that
statement,
he
also
said,
“i
never
the
saw
the
film
before
today
and
never
had
shown
them
to
anyone,
so
help
me.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
really
interested,
how
does
that
title
suggest
anything?
i
don't
get
this
“young
blood.”
what's
that
suggest?
or
is
it
my
age?
i
don't
know.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
guess
it
is
my
age.
justice
william
j.

for
sale.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
sale.
what'
bookseller
mean?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
case
did
involve
a
bookseller.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
did
involve
a
prosecution
for
having
books
for
sale,
didn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

i
