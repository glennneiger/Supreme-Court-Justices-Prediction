and
you
real,
isn't
it,
that
appropriately
some
of
these
questions
might
be
judicially
resolved?

(inaudible)
i
hope
you're
going
to
address
yourself
to
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute:
mere
possession,
without
any
purpose
to
exhibit,
sell,

justice

what
are
you
saying
to
your
adversary's
argument
that
the
state
constitutionally
says,
“we'll
nip
this
business
in
the
bud,”
the
person
that
is
to
say
that
given
hard-core
pornography
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it.
what
do
you
say
about
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
the
court
has
held,
at
least
the
majority
has
held
that
it
is
not
an
absolute
right
in
obscenity
field.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
starts
from
that
premise.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
your
adversary
is
saying
is
that
the
state
can
legitimately,
again,
on
the
premise
that
what's
involved
here
meets
the
roth
test.
