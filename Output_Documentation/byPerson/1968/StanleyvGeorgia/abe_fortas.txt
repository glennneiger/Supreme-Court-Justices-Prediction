do
you
think
we
have
to
view
the
film
if
there
are
constitutional
bases
that
don't
relate
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
film
for
disposing
of
this
case
such
as
the
question
of
mere
possession
or
the
search
and
seizure
question?
justice
abe
fortas
why
would
you
want
us
to
view
the
film?
justice
abe
fortas
even
if
we
think
that
you
can
dispose
of
this
case,
it
must
dispose
of
the
case
on
the
possession
ground,
or
the
search
and
seizure
fourth
amendment
ground?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
tell
me
why.
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean,
if
this
is
obscene
--
if
this
obscene,
we
should
not
reach
the
fourth
amendment
question?
justice
abe
fortas
the
fourth
amendment
question,
search
and
seizure.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
fortas.
this
is
stewart.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
understand,
but
i
want
to
be
clear
on
one
matter
with
respect
to
your
position.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
here
are
some
allegedly
obscene
films.
i
haven't
seen
them
but
if
i
should
decide
that
this
case
must
be
reversed
on
the
possession
point,
or
on
the
search
and
seizure
point,
fourth
amendment
point,
i
would
not
consider
it
as
presently
advised,
i
would
not
consider
it
necessary
to
endure
a
sight
of
motion
picture
films
whatever
their
content
may
be
and
do
you
consider
that
--
do
you
disagree
with
that
present
thought
of
mine?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
talking
about
the
first
amendment,
i'm
talking
about
the
two
points
and
i'm
talking
about,
namely
the
possession
and
the
manner
of
seizure
which
the
fourth
amendment
points.
justice
abe
fortas
but
if
we
should
conclude
that
a
statute
making
mere
possession,
a
criminal
offense
is
unconstitutional
under
first
amendment,
regardless
of
the
nature
of
the
films
then
obviously,
it
wouldn't
be
necessary
for
us
to
see
the
films,
would
it?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
but
i
say
assuming
that,
we
felt
assuming
that
i
should
conclude
that
so
far
as
i'm
concerned,
mere
possession
cannot
be
punished
as
a
crime
regardless
of
how
obscene
the
film
might
be,
then
it
would
follow
that
it
there'd
be
no
point
in
seeing
the
film,
isn't
that
right?
i
mean,
that
seems
to
me
to
follow
as
a
matter
of
course.
now,
i
know
your
position
is
that
if
the
film
is
obscene,
mere
possession
can
be
punished.
but
i
say
that
if
i
disagreed
with
that,
then
obviously,
it
would
not
be
necessary
for
me
endure
a
sight
of
this
film.
i'm
not
characterizing
it
as
obscene.i
don't
know
whether
it
is
or
not
but
it
probably
is
not
one
of
the
greatest
works
of
art
that's
ever
been
struck
by
the
hand
of
man.
justice
abe
fortas
to
get
back
to
this
possession
point,
under
the
state
law,
if
--
assuming
that
possession
were
a
crime,
mere
possession
was
a
crime
and
not
brought
by
the
first
amendment,
could
the
state
get
at
a
search
warrant
to
search
your
own
library
on
the
basis
of
an
affidavit
that
would
say
that
you
have
in
that
library
a
copy
of
james
joyce's
ulysses,
and
a
copy
of
this
book
and
that
book,
and
that
there
was
a
--
and
therefore,
they
get
out
a
search
warrant
to
examine
your
entire
library?
justice

other
words

they'd
have
to
