mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
request
the
marshal
to
notify
me
when
25
minutes
is
up,
i'd
like
to
save
five
minutes
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
thank
you.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
this
case
involves
the
constitutionality
of
the
georgia
obscenity
statute.
the
questions
raised
by
this
appeal,
in
so
far
as
the
constitutionality
of
the
statutes
is
concerned,
are
two-fold.
first,
we
raise
the
question
that
the
statute
violates
the
first
amendment
because
it
punishes
the
mere
possession
of
obscene
material
without
requiring
any
further
overt
act
on
the
part
of
the
possessor
or
intent
to
do
anything
with
it.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
this
was
a
possession,
if
your
honor
please,
where
robert
eli
stanley
had
possession
of
three
reels
of
motion
picture
film
in
a
desk
drawer
of
his
upstairs
bedroom
of
his
home.
there
was
no
allegation
in
the
indictment
of
any
showing
or
attempt
to
exhibit
or
show
these
films
or
pander
them
or
show
them
to
minors.
the
only
question
involved
in
so
far
as
the
indictment
was
concerned
was
that
he
possessed
them
knowing
them
to
have
been
obscene
or
that
he
should
reasonably
have
known
them
to
have
been
obscene.
the
second
question
of
our
constitutional
attack
on
this
statute
is
the
use
of
the
language
in
the
statute
and
in
the
indictment
to
the
effect
that
he
reasonably
should
have
known
of
the
obscene
nature
of
the
film
removes
the
element
of
scienter
from
the
definition
of
the
offense.
and
thus,
permits
the
state
to
secure
a
conviction
for
possessing
these
films
on
a
showing
less
than
actual
knowledge
on
his
part
that
they
were
obscene.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
we
do
not
concede
them
to
be
obscene
and
if
we
took
that
position
with
the
trial
court
that
under
the
first
amendment
in
so
far
as
possession
itself
is
concerned
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
obscenity.
the
reason
we
took
that
position
and
now
take
this
position
is
this,
that
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
freedom
of
press
clause
of
the
first
amendment
to
restrict
a
person
or
to
prohibit
a
person
from
possessing
anything
they
want
in
so
far
as
its
claim
of
obscenity
is
concerned.
we
take
the
position
that
where
a
person
merely
possesses
an
article
alleged
to
be
obscene
and
does
not
attempt
to
distribute
it
or
show
it
to
any
other
persons,
as
was
the
case
in
this
case
and
as
was
the
indictment
in
this
case
and
as
with
the
holding
by
supreme
court
that
the
mere
possession
is
an
offense
under
the
definition
georgia
law
that
any
evidence
in
the
case
on
the
part
of
the
state
or
any
contention
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
the
effect
that
the
evidence
might
have
circumstantially
show
that
he
was
about
to
have
a
party
and
about
to
show
these
films
to
other
persons
would
be
completely
irrelevant
for
this
court
to
consider.
it
has
no
relevancy
here
because
of
the
fact
that
he
was
only
charged
with
the
mere
possession.
now,
to
my
knowledge,
this
exact
question
has
never
been
passed
upon
by
this
court.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
person
can
be
prohibited
by
the
states
from
merely
possessing
obscene
material
or
obscene
writings
or
pictures.
clearly,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
mere
possession,
that
anyone
would
have
the
right
to
say
draw
a
picture
which
might
obviously
be
obscene
to
some
other
persons
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
or
put
it
in
his
desk
drawer.
or
if
he
wanted
to
take
a
picture
of
himself
or
picture
of
himself
and
his
wife
in
a
sexual
act
that
this
would
be
a
matter
that
he
could
determine
as
long
he
did
not
attempt
to
pander
this
material,
attempt
to
sell
it,
distribute
it,
or
distribute
it
to
minors.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
these
films
were
in
a
desk
drawer.
these
of
course
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
could
not.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
the
officers
and
this
is
--
i
might
as
well
mention
this
at
the
outset
right
here.
the
second
part
of
our
contention
is,
the
officers
were
armed.
they
were
federal
and
state
officers,
were
armed
with
a
federal
search
issued
by
united
states
commissioner
on
a
claim
that
the
defendant
was
violating
the
wagering
tax
act.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
since
then,
of
course,
this
court
has
held
that
the
provisions
of
that
law
are
constitutionally
impermissible.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes,
yes,
yes.
this
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes
sir,
then
and
there.
they
went
in
on
with
the
search
warrant
issued
by
the
united
states
commission
which
did
not
call
for
the
seizure
of
any
obscene
film
but
call
for
the
seizure
of
gambling
paraphernalia.
no
gambling
paraphernalia
was
seized
except
some
negligible
things
that
i
think
the
state
concedes
were
not
sufficient
but
during
their
search,
they
search
through
his
drawer
and
found
three
cans
of
films,
eight-millimeter
film
which
they
testified,
they
could
not
discern
or
know
from
their
own
knowledge
that
it
was
or
what
it
was.
so
they
found
in
the
closet
a
projector
and
they
found
a
screen
and
they
showed
these
films,
and
looked
at
them
and
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
then
they
set
up
the
screen
and
they
showed
them.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
i
would
think
not.
i
would
not
think
not.
i
wouldn't
know
that
there
was
any
connection
between
them
but
what
happened
after
they
showed
these
films
not
having
a
warrant
to
seize
the
films.
the
evidence
shows
in
the
case
and
in
the
record
that
the
officer,
the
state
officer
called
the
solicitor
general
who
was
the
prosecuting
officer
for
that
circuit
and
told
him
they
didn't
find
gambling
paraphernalia
but
that
they
did
find
some
films
and
it's
in
the
record
that
solicitor
general
then
stated
to
him,
“after
you
view
the
films,
if
in
your
opinion
they
are
obscene,
seize
the
films
and
book
a
case,
and
i'll
set
a
bond.”
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
i
think
so.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
i
distinguish
that
and
i
concede
that
where
evidence
is
seized
or
when
a
contraband
is
seized
where
it's
not
such
as
would
be
subject
to
a
claim
of
the
first
amendment,
freedom
of
press
or
freedom
of
speech
that
the
states
do
have
the
right
to
prohibit
the
possession.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes.
--
that
is
counterfeit
money.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes
sir.
i
think
any
case.
now,
we
concede
that
in
our
brief
and
make
that
distinction
that
in
this
particular
case,
these
were
films
alleged
to
be
obscene
from
the
very
start.
they
weren't
seized
as
gambling
paraphernalia
but
they
were
seized
under
a
warrant
issued
by
united
states
commissioner
under
the
wagering
tax
act,
under
a
contention
that
the
defendant
had
not
registered
as
a
gambler.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
no
sir.
he
was
not.
there
was
no
claim
of
any
distributorship.
he
was
an
individual
in
his
own
home.
the
state
of
course
alleged
and
contended
that
he
had
a
record
for
gambling
in
the
past
and
that
federal
agents,
the
state
agents,
were
going
in
for
that
purpose,
that
they
had
probable
cause.
one
of
the
contentions
in
the
affidavit
being
that
he
had
not
registered
as
a
gambler
and
paid
his
tax
which
of
course
since
then
in
grosso
and
marchetti,
this
case
has
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
no,
sir.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
this
is
the
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
this
was
brought
up
in
the
brief
to
this
court,
that
there
were
biscuits
being
ready
to
put
in
the
stove,
that
there
were
well-dressed
people
who
came
to
the
house,
that
this
man
was
a
bachelor
and
his
girlfriend
had
come
there
and
that
the
officers
had
turn
them
away.
they
said
that
the
table
was
set
for
eight
people.
it
looked
they
were
fixing
to
have
supper,
getting
ready
to
have
supper
and
for
this
reason
they
said
that
apparently,
he
was
going
to
have
a
party.
this
was
the
conte
--
this
is
now
the
contention
raised
by
the
state.
but
i
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
this
that
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
sir?
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
in
atlanta.
the
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that's
what
they
claimed.
they
claimed
circumstantially.
there's
no
evidence
of
that
law.
the
defendant
denied
knowing
anything
about
the
film.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that's
right.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
upstairs
in
the
bedroom
of
the
defendant
in
a
desk
drawer.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
no,
sir.
none
whatsoever.
no
testimony
of
that
at
all.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
well,
i
would
imagine
that
you
would
show
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
well,
i
think
that
an
individual
could
do
as
he
pleases
with
it
but
the
point
is
in
this
case,
and
this
is
the
paramount
we
bring
in
here
that
the
state
did
not
contend
by
its
indictment
that
he
had
any
to
intent
show
them
and
this
was
one
of
our
grounds
of
demurrer
in
the
trial
court
in
the
state
court.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
whether
there
was
any
intent
to
do
anything
with
it.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that's
right.
for
his
showing
and
for
his
own
use.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
maybe
he
wasn't
going
to
show.
he
contended
by
his
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
well,
he
could.
in
his
statement,
he
said
that
i
have
never
seen
these
films
before,
that
a
man
brought
them
to
my
house
on
labor
day
which
was
about
four
or
five
before
this
but
the
point
was
that
the
state
at
no
time
in
its
indictment
charges,
we
demurred
on
the
ground
of
vagueness
of
the
georgia
statute.
the
georgia
statute
did
not
specifically
make
the
mere
possession
on
offense
and
that
we
ask
for
interpretation
by
the
state
court
and
got
it.
the
supreme
court
construed
the
language
to
be
sufficient
to
make
the
mere
possession
on
offense
and
that's
why
we're
in
this
court.
because
of
the
fact
that
we
are
reinforced
by
the
state
court
decision
holding
that
the
mere
possession
is
an
offense
and
we
say
that
gives
it
an
unconstitutional
interpretation.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
i
believe
so
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that's
correct.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that's
correct.
that
is
the
holding
of
the
supreme
court,
so
the
question
is
squarely
before
this
court
as
to
whether
or
not
under
that
interpretation,
given
to
or
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
whether
or
not
that
can
be
squared
with
the
first
amendment
whether
mere
possession
of
material
alleged
to
be
obscene
pictures
or
writings
can
be
constitutionally
made
a
criminal
offense.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
under
georgia,
under
the
interpretation
given
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes,
sir.
he
received
a
year's
punishment
in
prison.
that
was
fixed
by
the
jury
and
it
was
under
the
charge
of
the
court,
of
course
under
georgia
law,
peculiarly,
the
jury
fixes
the
punishment
and
under
the
charge
of
the
court,
the
court
charged
the
mere
possession
as
being
--
that
that's
all
they
have
to
consider
together
with
either
that
he
had
knowledge
that
they
were
obscene
or
that
he
should
reasonably
have
known
of
its
obscene
nature.
now,
this
gets
to
the
scienter
question
whether
or
not
a
state
can
withdraw
the
element
of
scienter
by
permitting
a
conviction
to
rest
upon
less
evidence
than
actual
knowledge
that
it
is
obscene.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes,
he's
been
out
on
bail
and
the
second
question
involved
in
this
case
as
i
stated
is
that
this
court
has
held
in
grosso
and
marchetti,
since
this
case
was
tried
that
the
wagering
tax
act
is
constitutionally
unenforceable.
now,
this
holding
by
the
court,
we
say,
renders
the
search
warrant
that
was
issued
in
this
case
invalid.
we
filed
a
motion
to
suppress
in
the
trial
court.
in
our
motion
to
suppress
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
the
search
warrant
was
issued
before
grosso
and
marchetti
decision.
it
was
issued
1967
but
it
was
about
--
it
was
some
months
before
grosso
and
marchetti.
but
we
filed
a
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
and
in
our
motion,
the
allegation
was
made
that
the
films
were
seized
without
a
valid
search
warrant,
particularly
describing
the
articles
to
be
seized.
that
language
we
say
is
sufficient
to
now
reach
back
as
of
that
time
and
say
that
that
was
a
sufficient
attack
upon
the
warrant
itself.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
not
only
look
into
the
film
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes,
sir.
not
only
look
at
the
film
but
there
had
been
--
this
requires
on
the
question
of
obscenity,
it
would
require
at
least
a
finding
of
the
magistrate
to
determine
that
these
films
were
obscene.
in
this
particular
case,
the
evidence
is
clear
that
this
officer
called
the
solicitor
general
and
asked
the
solicitor
general
what
to
do
and
he
told
him,
if
in
your
opinion
they
are
obscene,
seize
the
films
and
make
a
case
and
i'll
set
the
bond.
now,
we
say
that
this
would
require
before
a
film
or
a
picture
or
photograph
or
anything
else
can
be
considered
to
be
obscene,
there
must
be
some
judicial
finding,
some
notice,
some
knowledge
that
these
films
have
been
declared
to
be
obscene
at
least
that
much
and
we
say
that
for
that
reason,
that
even
though
officers
would
be
authorized
under
search
warrants
to
seize
contraband
not
named
in
the
article
that
they
would
not
be
authorized
to
seize
films
alleged
to
be
obscene,
that
the
solicitor
general
himself
had
no
judicial
powers
under
law
of
georgia,
had
no
right
to
himself
has
seized
in
the
films,
but
in
this
case,
he
delegated
some
sort
of
judicial
power
to
the
officer
making
the
--
making
the
finding
and
told
him
if
in
your
opinion,
they're
obscene
then
make
a
case.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes
sir,
marcus
case.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that
was
under
the
missouri
statute.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
well,
if
he
had
it
--
if
the
solicitor
general
had
instructed
the
officer,
submit
your
facts
to
a
magistrate
and
if
he
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
well,
no.
he
could
by
affidavit
submit
to
a
magistrate
who
was
authorized
to
issue
a
warrant,
he
could
submit
what
these
films
revealed
to
him.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that's
right.
he
was
not
even
entitled
to
look
at
them
which
of
course
is
again
the
question.
but
we
say
under
either
one
of
those
theories,
the
seizure
of
the
film
was
illegal.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
well
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
of
course
your
honor
that's
true
but
we
--
i
think
that's
something
that
has
been
the
subject
of
discussion
for
many,
many
years
as
to
whether
or
not
an
item
does
have
redeeming
social
value
or
whether
or
not
it
could
be
classified
as
obscene.
whether
or
not
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes
sir,
the
movies
were
shown
at
the
trial.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes,
sir.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes
i
think
this
court
has
it
and
i
would
say
that
of
course
i
think
and
i
would
concede
to
this
court
that
the
pictures,
the
films
in
so
far
as
films
are
concerned
i
think
are
disgusting
but
i
don't
know
if
disgusting
makes
them
obscene.
i
don't
know
that
they
would
appeal.
they
wouldn't
appeal
to
my
prurient
interest.
i
don't
know
whose
prurient
interest
they
would
appeal
to
because
i
think
that
they're
sickening.
but
i
don't
think
that
there'd
be
anymore
sickening
than
it
would
be
to
show
a
man
being
tortured
to
death
and
having
guts
tore
out
but
that
wouldn't
be
obscene.
it's
really
hard
to
say
what
obscenity
and
i
--
but
getting
right
to
the
point
in
this
case,
we
say
that
if
they
are
the
vilest,
the
foulest,
the
filthiest
pictures
that
could
ever
be
seen
that
a
person
has
the
right
to
possess
them
as
long
as
he
does
not,
and
this
is
what
this
court
held
last
year
in
redrup
and
the
other
cases
along
with
redrup,
that
as
long
as
there
is
no
pandering,
as
long
as
there
is
no
exhibition
to
minors
and
as
long
as
there
is
no
intrusion
upon
the
privacy
of
other
persons
who
are
unwilling
to
see
them
then
of
course,
we
have
nothing
to
and
this
is
all
we
have
in
this
case.
unless
we
want
to
accept
state's
theory
that
because
there
was
some
biscuits
being
prepared,
put
in
the
stove,
because
of
the
fact
that
there
was
table
that
was
set
for
eight
when
they
were
going
to
have
dinner,
and
against
the
statement
of
the
defendant
on
the
trial
of
the
case,
nothing
to
refute
that
that
a
man
had
brought
these
films
to
him
several
days
before
and
told
him,
“i
have
some
films,
i'd
like
you
to
see.”
now,
we
say
this,
if
the
court
please,
that
wherever
we
find
that
a
question
of
obscenity
is
concerned
or
whether
or
not
we
know
that
something
is
obscene.
if
a
tells
b,
i
have
some
pictures
here
i
want
to
give
you
and
these
pictures
are
obscene.
does
that
say
that
b
cannot
determine
or
ascertain
for
himself
whether
they
are
obscene
to
him
or
does
that
mean
that
he
would
have
the
right
to
him
first
himself
inspect
those
films
and
say
i
have
a
right
under
the
first
amendment
to
determine
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
well,
that
is
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that's
correct.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that's
right.
and
that's
why
i
say
if
your
honor
please,
that
because
of
that,
a
man
has
right
to
determine
for
himself
if
it
offends
him,
if
to
him
it's
obscene
because
it
would
violate
the
first
amendment
that
if
a
man
handed
me
some
films.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
none
whatsoever
except
the
fact
they
said
an
expert
testified
that
the
films
have
been
scratched,
one
of
them
was
been
wound
backwards
to
show
that
someone
had
seen
them
at
some
time
in
the
past
but
nothing
to
show
that
he
had
seen
them
or
he
had
ever
viewed
them.
and
there's
nothing
to
refute
or
rebut
his
statement
that
he
had
never
seen
them
before.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
it
was
in
a
desk
drawer
of
his
bedroom
upstairs.
and
there
was
no
set
up,
nothing
set
up,
no
screen
set
up
to
show
these
or
view
these
films.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
well
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
i
think
that
would
analogies.
so
i
would
like
to
reserve
what
time
i
have.
i
know
the
white
light
hasn't
come
on,
i
would
like
to
reserve
if
i
may
the
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
may
it
please
the
court.
with
respect
to
smith
versus
california,
that
prosecution
involved
a
bookseller
under
an
ordinance
providing
or
referring
to
booksellers.
consequently,
the
sale
--
we're
dealing
with
a
person
now
who
is
in
the
business
of
selling
books.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
in
the
roth
case
where
that
principle
was
established,
we
find
that
the
roth
case
was
a
question
of
distribution
and
in
an
instance
where
an
individual
who
is
possessing
something
that
will
admittedly
say
as
pornographic,
the
constitution
does
not
protect
him
from
the
distribution
and
this
is
followed
in
the
redrup
case.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that's
correct.
but
the
case
was
dealing
with
a
question
of
the
distribution.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that's
correct.
the
case
does
not
hold
that
bare
possession
or
mere
possession
was
not
protected.
the
court
said
in
roth
that
obscenity
was
not
protected
but
they
were
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
the
critical
fact
is
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
because
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
well,
in
the
distribution,
you're
dealing
with
a
question
of
furnishing
it
to
others
and
the
mere
possession
in
your
own
privacy
of
your
own
home
where
no
one
else
has
seen
it.
there's
no
evidence
that
anyone
has
or
no
one
else
is
intended
to
come
into
contact
with
it,
i
say
that
no
case
holds
that
it
is
not
protected,
that
an
individual
cannot
take
a
picture
of
his
whole
obscenity
and
for
posterity
for
himself
if
he
so
chooses,
because
to
do
so,
to
prohibit
a
person
from
possessing
it
would
in
itself
violate
first
amendment
rights.
because
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that
in
itself
--
that
in
itself
would
be
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
to
say
that
a
person
could
not
write
what
he
wants
in
his
own
diary
let's
say,
that
he's
going
to
keep
for
his
own
personal
future
in
his
own
drawer
not
to
be
shown
to
any
other
persons,
we
say
that
the
first
amendment
is
an
absolute
amendment
that
gives
the
man
the
freedom
of
the
press
and
the
freedom
the
press
carries
with
it,
the
freedom
of
motion
picture
films.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
but
that
was
held
in
the
roth
case,
if
your
honor
please,
and
the
roth
case
involves.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that's
right.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
then
we
come
in
to
the
redrup
case.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
well
then
we
come
in
to
the
redrup
case
which
was
decided
since
roth
and
this
court
last
year
in
redrup
and
the
other
cases
that
went
with
it
reversed
on
the
theory
and
on
the
principle,
that
there
had
been
--
that
this
was
not
a
case
involving
one
of
the
three
elements,
either
distribution
to
minors,
distribution
to
persons
who
are
unwilling
to
see
it,
or
pandering
as
was
held
in
ginsberg.
now,
if
we
accept
redrup
as
being
the
law,
then
of
course
we
must
take
redrup
and
roth
together
as
they
both
hold
and
say
that
obscenity
insofar
as
it's
mere
possession
and
bare
possession,
to
use
that
expression,
the
bare
possession
is
concerned,
would
be
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
because
there
you
are
not
intruding
upon
the
privacy
or
the
rights
of
others
to
be
free
from
this
stuff.
now,
in
the
finding
--
one
thing
i
would
like
to
answer
my
opponent
with
respect
to,
he
says
that
the
state
court
found
that
the
state
statute
did
not
remove
the
element
of
scienter.
now,
the
rule
as
i
understand
it
is
that
this
court
will
accept
an
interpretation
placed
upon
a
state
court
as
to
a
non-federal
ground.
but
as
to
a
federal
constitutional
ground,
this
court
is
not
precluded
by
virtue
of
a
holding
of
a
state
court
on
a
constitutional
issue
from
reversing
that
state
court
because
this
is
the
final
arbiter.
this
court
is
the
one
that
must
decide
the
federal
ground.
now,
secondly,
in
the
brief
of
the
appellee
on
page
45,
he
cites
the
case
of
rainwater
versus
florida
which
was
decided
by
this
court
during
the
last
term.
the
rainwater
versus
florida
case
was
one
that
originated
in
the
state
court.
there
was
a
federal
search
warrant
issued
under
the
wagering
tax
act
(inaudible)
certain
items
from
the
defendant's
possession
and
they
prosecuted
them
in
the
state
courts.
this
court
remanded
that
under
the
theory
of
grosso
and
marchetti,
remanded
it
back
to
the
state
court
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
grosso
and
marchetti.
this
is
identical
to
the
case
we
have
here.
the
state
says
in
its
brief
that
there
the
prosecution,
the
state
court,
was
the
end-result
of
the
issuance
of
the
federal
search
warrant.
that's
what
we
have
in
this
case.
this
prosecution
for
obscenity
was
the
end-result
of
the
issuance
of
the
federal
search
warrant
which
actually
under
the
rainwater
versus
florida
doctrine
was
inadmissible
as
having
been
unconstitutionally
obtained.
now,
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
i
would
not
think
so.
i
would
not
think
--
i
think
that
the
constitution,
the
fourth
amendment
says
that
the
warrant
shall
particularly
describe
the
articles
to
be
seized.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that
is
--
that
is
my
view
of
that
amendment.
now,
one
point
was
raised
by
my
adversary.
he
says
that
the
evidence
in
the
case
indicated
that
one
reel
of
film
had
been
wound
backwards
or
was
scratched
and
that
that
would
indicate
that
someone
had
previously
viewed
that
film.
but
it
would
not
show
and
we
submit
to
this
court
that
that
fact
alone
could
not
and
would
not
show
that
this
defendant
or
this
appellant
had
ever
viewed
them.
now,
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
state
that
since
my
opponent
has
--
or
my
adversary
has
suggested
to
this
court
that
this
court
view
the
film,
he
has
in
effect
stated
that
that
how
does
this
court
know
that
they
are
obscene
without
viewing
them.
now,
that
is
our
very
position
in
this
case.
we
say
that
with
respect
to
the
appellant.
the
same
position
holds
true.
if
he
has
never
viewed
the
films,
he
would
not
obviously
know
that
they're
obscene
because
without
viewing
them,
you
cannot
learn
of
its
obscenity
and
that
is
the
point
that
we
have
in
this
case.
we
say
that
since
the
evidence
doesn't
show
that
he
ever
viewed
the
films
that
therefore
there's
no
evidence
that
he
knew,
or
could
have
known
that
they
were
obscene.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
request
the
marshal
to
notify
me
when
25
minutes
is
up,
i'd
like
to
save
five
minutes
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
thank
you.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
this
case
involves
the
constitutionality
of
the
georgia
obscenity
statute.
the
questions
raised
by
this
appeal,
in
so
far
as
the
constitutionality
of
the
statutes
is
concerned,
are
two-fold.
first,
we
raise
the
question
that
the
statute
violates
the
first
amendment
because
it
punishes
the
mere
possession
of
obscene
material
without
requiring
any
further
overt
act
on
the
part
of
the
possessor
or
intent
to
do
anything
with
it.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
this
was
a
possession,
if
your
honor
please,
where
robert
eli
stanley
had
possession
of
three
reels
of
motion
picture
film
in
a
desk
drawer
of
his
upstairs
bedroom
of
his
home.
there
was
no
allegation
in
the
indictment
of
any
showing
or
attempt
to
exhibit
or
show
these
films
or
pander
them
or
show
them
to
minors.
the
only
question
involved
in
so
far
as
the
indictment
was
concerned
was
that
he
possessed
them
knowing
them
to
have
been
obscene
or
that
he
should
reasonably
have
known
them
to
have
been
obscene.
the
second
question
of
our
constitutional
attack
on
this
statute
is
the
use
of
the
language
in
the
statute
and
in
the
indictment
to
the
effect
that
he
reasonably
should
have
known
of
the
obscene
nature
of
the
film
removes
the
element
of
scienter
from
the
definition
of
the
offense.
and
thus,
permits
the
state
to
secure
a
conviction
for
possessing
these
films
on
a
showing
less
than
actual
knowledge
on
his
part
that
they
were
obscene.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
we
do
not
concede
them
to
be
obscene
and
if
we
took
that
position
with
the
trial
court
that
under
the
first
amendment
in
so
far
as
possession
itself
is
concerned
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
obscenity.
the
reason
we
took
that
position
and
now
take
this
position
is
this,
that
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
freedom
of
press
clause
of
the
first
amendment
to
restrict
a
person
or
to
prohibit
a
person
from
possessing
anything
they
want
in
so
far
as
its
claim
of
obscenity
is
concerned.
we
take
the
position
that
where
a
person
merely
possesses
an
article
alleged
to
be
obscene
and
does
not
attempt
to
distribute
it
or
show
it
to
any
other
persons,
as
was
the
case
in
this
case
and
as
was
the
indictment
in
this
case
and
as
with
the
holding
by
supreme
court
that
the
mere
possession
is
an
offense
under
the
definition
georgia
law
that
any
evidence
in
the
case
on
the
part
of
the
state
or
any
contention
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
the
effect
that
the
evidence
might
have
circumstantially
show
that
he
was
about
to
have
a
party
and
about
to
show
these
films
to
other
persons
would
be
completely
irrelevant
for
this
court
to
consider.
it
has
no
relevancy
here
because
of
the
fact
that
he
was
only
charged
with
the
mere
possession.
now,
to
my
knowledge,
this
exact
question
has
never
been
passed
upon
by
this
court.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
person
can
be
prohibited
by
the
states
from
merely
possessing
obscene
material
or
obscene
writings
or
pictures.
clearly,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
mere
possession,
that
anyone
would
have
the
right
to
say
draw
a
picture
which
might
obviously
be
obscene
to
some
other
persons
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
or
put
it
in
his
desk
drawer.
or
if
he
wanted
to
take
a
picture
of
himself
or
picture
of
himself
and
his
wife
in
a
sexual
act
that
this
would
be
a
matter
that
he
could
determine
as
long
he
did
not
attempt
to
pander
this
material,
attempt
to
sell
it,
distribute
it,
or
distribute
it
to
minors.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
these
films
were
in
a
desk
drawer.
these
of
course
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
could
not.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
the
officers
and
this
is
--
i
might
as
well
mention
this
at
the
outset
right
here.
the
second
part
of
our
contention
is,
the
officers
were
armed.
they
were
federal
and
state
officers,
were
armed
with
a
federal
search
issued
by
united
states
commissioner
on
a
claim
that
the
defendant
was
violating
the
wagering
tax
act.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
since
then,
of
course,
this
court
has
held
that
the
provisions
of
that
law
are
constitutionally
impermissible.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes,
yes,
yes.
this
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes
sir,
then
and
there.
they
went
in
on
with
the
search
warrant
issued
by
the
united
states
commission
which
did
not
call
for
the
seizure
of
any
obscene
film
but
call
for
the
seizure
of
gambling
paraphernalia.
no
gambling
paraphernalia
was
seized
except
some
negligible
things
that
i
think
the
state
concedes
were
not
sufficient
but
during
their
search,
they
search
through
his
drawer
and
found
three
cans
of
films,
eight-millimeter
film
which
they
testified,
they
could
not
discern
or
know
from
their
own
knowledge
that
it
was
or
what
it
was.
so
they
found
in
the
closet
a
projector
and
they
found
a
screen
and
they
showed
these
films,
and
looked
at
them
and
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
then
they
set
up
the
screen
and
they
showed
them.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
i
would
think
not.
i
would
not
think
not.
i
wouldn't
know
that
there
was
any
connection
between
them
but
what
happened
after
they
showed
these
films
not
having
a
warrant
to
seize
the
films.
the
evidence
shows
in
the
case
and
in
the
record
that
the
officer,
the
state
officer
called
the
solicitor
general
who
was
the
prosecuting
officer
for
that
circuit
and
told
him
they
didn't
find
gambling
paraphernalia
but
that
they
did
find
some
films
and
it's
in
the
record
that
solicitor
general
then
stated
to
him,
“after
you
view
the
films,
if
in
your
opinion
they
are
obscene,
seize
the
films
and
book
a
case,
and
i'll
set
a
bond.”
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
i
think
so.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
i
distinguish
that
and
i
concede
that
where
evidence
is
seized
or
when
a
contraband
is
seized
where
it's
not
such
as
would
be
subject
to
a
claim
of
the
first
amendment,
freedom
of
press
or
freedom
of
speech
that
the
states
do
have
the
right
to
prohibit
the
possession.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes.
--
that
is
counterfeit
money.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes
sir.
i
think
any
case.
now,
we
concede
that
in
our
brief
and
make
that
distinction
that
in
this
particular
case,
these
were
films
alleged
to
be
obscene
from
the
very
start.
they
weren't
seized
as
gambling
paraphernalia
but
they
were
seized
under
a
warrant
issued
by
united
states
commissioner
under
the
wagering
tax
act,
under
a
contention
that
the
defendant
had
not
registered
as
a
gambler.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
no
sir.
he
was
not.
there
was
no
claim
of
any
distributorship.
he
was
an
individual
in
his
own
home.
the
state
of
course
alleged
and
contended
that
he
had
a
record
for
gambling
in
the
past
and
that
federal
agents,
the
state
agents,
were
going
in
for
that
purpose,
that
they
had
probable
cause.
one
of
the
contentions
in
the
affidavit
being
that
he
had
not
registered
as
a
gambler
and
paid
his
tax
which
of
course
since
then
in
grosso
and
marchetti,
this
case
has
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
no,
sir.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
this
is
the
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
this
was
brought
up
in
the
brief
to
this
court,
that
there
were
biscuits
being
ready
to
put
in
the
stove,
that
there
were
well-dressed
people
who
came
to
the
house,
that
this
man
was
a
bachelor
and
his
girlfriend
had
come
there
and
that
the
officers
had
turn
them
away.
they
said
that
the
table
was
set
for
eight
people.
it
looked
they
were
fixing
to
have
supper,
getting
ready
to
have
supper
and
for
this
reason
they
said
that
apparently,
he
was
going
to
have
a
party.
this
was
the
conte
--
this
is
now
the
contention
raised
by
the
state.
but
i
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
this
that
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
sir?
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
in
atlanta.
the
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that's
what
they
claimed.
they
claimed
circumstantially.
there's
no
evidence
of
that
law.
the
defendant
denied
knowing
anything
about
the
film.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that's
right.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
upstairs
in
the
bedroom
of
the
defendant
in
a
desk
drawer.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
no,
sir.
none
whatsoever.
no
testimony
of
that
at
all.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
well,
i
would
imagine
that
you
would
show
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
well,
i
think
that
an
individual
could
do
as
he
pleases
with
it
but
the
point
is
in
this
case,
and
this
is
the
paramount
we
bring
in
here
that
the
state
did
not
contend
by
its
indictment
that
he
had
any
to
intent
show
them
and
this
was
one
of
our
grounds
of
demurrer
in
the
trial
court
in
the
state
court.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
whether
there
was
any
intent
to
do
anything
with
it.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that's
right.
for
his
showing
and
for
his
own
use.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
maybe
he
wasn't
going
to
show.
he
contended
by
his
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
well,
he
could.
in
his
statement,
he
said
that
i
have
never
seen
these
films
before,
that
a
man
brought
them
to
my
house
on
labor
day
which
was
about
four
or
five
before
this
but
the
point
was
that
the
state
at
no
time
in
its
indictment
charges,
we
demurred
on
the
ground
of
vagueness
of
the
georgia
statute.
the
georgia
statute
did
not
specifically
make
the
mere
possession
on
offense
and
that
we
ask
for
interpretation
by
the
state
court
and
got
it.
the
supreme
court
construed
the
language
to
be
sufficient
to
make
the
mere
possession
on
offense
and
that's
why
we're
in
this
court.
because
of
the
fact
that
we
are
reinforced
by
the
state
court
decision
holding
that
the
mere
possession
is
an
offense
and
we
say
that
gives
it
an
unconstitutional
interpretation.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
i
believe
so
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that's
correct.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that's
correct.
that
is
the
holding
of
the
supreme
court,
so
the
question
is
squarely
before
this
court
as
to
whether
or
not
under
that
interpretation,
given
to
or
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
whether
or
not
that
can
be
squared
with
the
first
amendment
whether
mere
possession
of
material
alleged
to
be
obscene
pictures
or
writings
can
be
constitutionally
made
a
criminal
offense.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
under
georgia,
under
the
interpretation
given
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes,
sir.
he
received
a
year's
punishment
in
prison.
that
was
fixed
by
the
jury
and
it
was
under
the
charge
of
the
court,
of
course
under
georgia
law,
peculiarly,
the
jury
fixes
the
punishment
and
under
the
charge
of
the
court,
the
court
charged
the
mere
possession
as
being
--
that
that's
all
they
have
to
consider
together
with
either
that
he
had
knowledge
that
they
were
obscene
or
that
he
should
reasonably
have
known
of
its
obscene
nature.
now,
this
gets
to
the
scienter
question
whether
or
not
a
state
can
withdraw
the
element
of
scienter
by
permitting
a
conviction
to
rest
upon
less
evidence
than
actual
knowledge
that
it
is
obscene.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes,
he's
been
out
on
bail
and
the
second
question
involved
in
this
case
as
i
stated
is
that
this
court
has
held
in
grosso
and
marchetti,
since
this
case
was
tried
that
the
wagering
tax
act
is
constitutionally
unenforceable.
now,
this
holding
by
the
court,
we
say,
renders
the
search
warrant
that
was
issued
in
this
case
invalid.
we
filed
a
motion
to
suppress
in
the
trial
court.
in
our
motion
to
suppress
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
the
search
warrant
was
issued
before
grosso
and
marchetti
decision.
it
was
issued
1967
but
it
was
about
--
it
was
some
months
before
grosso
and
marchetti.
but
we
filed
a
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
and
in
our
motion,
the
allegation
was
made
that
the
films
were
seized
without
a
valid
search
warrant,
particularly
describing
the
articles
to
be
seized.
that
language
we
say
is
sufficient
to
now
reach
back
as
of
that
time
and
say
that
that
was
a
sufficient
attack
upon
the
warrant
itself.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
not
only
look
into
the
film
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes,
sir.
not
only
look
at
the
film
but
there
had
been
--
this
requires
on
the
question
of
obscenity,
it
would
require
at
least
a
finding
of
the
magistrate
to
determine
that
these
films
were
obscene.
in
this
particular
case,
the
evidence
is
clear
that
this
officer
called
the
solicitor
general
and
asked
the
solicitor
general
what
to
do
and
he
told
him,
if
in
your
opinion
they
are
obscene,
seize
the
films
and
make
a
case
and
i'll
set
the
bond.
now,
we
say
that
this
would
require
before
a
film
or
a
picture
or
photograph
or
anything
else
can
be
considered
to
be
obscene,
there
must
be
some
judicial
finding,
some
notice,
some
knowledge
that
these
films
have
been
declared
to
be
obscene
at
least
that
much
and
we
say
that
for
that
reason,
that
even
though
officers
would
be
authorized
under
search
warrants
to
seize
contraband
not
named
in
the
article
that
they
would
not
be
authorized
to
seize
films
alleged
to
be
obscene,
that
the
solicitor
general
himself
had
no
judicial
powers
under
law
of
georgia,
had
no
right
to
himself
has
seized
in
the
films,
but
in
this
case,
he
delegated
some
sort
of
judicial
power
to
the
officer
making
the
--
making
the
finding
and
told
him
if
in
your
opinion,
they're
obscene
then
make
a
case.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes
sir,
marcus
case.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that
was
under
the
missouri
statute.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
well,
if
he
had
it
--
if
the
solicitor
general
had
instructed
the
officer,
submit
your
facts
to
a
magistrate
and
if
he
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
well,
no.
he
could
by
affidavit
submit
to
a
magistrate
who
was
authorized
to
issue
a
warrant,
he
could
submit
what
these
films
revealed
to
him.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that's
right.
he
was
not
even
entitled
to
look
at
them
which
of
course
is
again
the
question.
but
we
say
under
either
one
of
those
theories,
the
seizure
of
the
film
was
illegal.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
well
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
of
course
your
honor
that's
true
but
we
--
i
think
that's
something
that
has
been
the
subject
of
discussion
for
many,
many
years
as
to
whether
or
not
an
item
does
have
redeeming
social
value
or
whether
or
not
it
could
be
classified
as
obscene.
whether
or
not
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes
sir,
the
movies
were
shown
at
the
trial.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes,
sir.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes
i
think
this
court
has
it
and
i
would
say
that
of
course
i
think
and
i
would
concede
to
this
court
that
the
pictures,
the
films
in
so
far
as
films
are
concerned
i
think
are
disgusting
but
i
don't
know
if
disgusting
makes
them
obscene.
i
don't
know
that
they
would
appeal.
they
wouldn't
appeal
to
my
prurient
interest.
i
don't
know
whose
prurient
interest
they
would
appeal
to
because
i
think
that
they're
sickening.
but
i
don't
think
that
there'd
be
anymore
sickening
than
it
would
be
to
show
a
man
being
tortured
to
death
and
having
guts
tore
out
but
that
wouldn't
be
obscene.
it's
really
hard
to
say
what
obscenity
and
i
--
but
getting
right
to
the
point
in
this
case,
we
say
that
if
they
are
the
vilest,
the
foulest,
the
filthiest
pictures
that
could
ever
be
seen
that
a
person
has
the
right
to
possess
them
as
long
as
he
does
not,
and
this
is
what
this
court
held
last
year
in
redrup
and
the
other
cases
along
with
redrup,
that
as
long
as
there
is
no
pandering,
as
long
as
there
is
no
exhibition
to
minors
and
as
long
as
there
is
no
intrusion
upon
the
privacy
of
other
persons
who
are
unwilling
to
see
them
then
of
course,
we
have
nothing
to
and
this
is
all
we
have
in
this
case.
unless
we
want
to
accept
state's
theory
that
because
there
was
some
biscuits
being
prepared,
put
in
the
stove,
because
of
the
fact
that
there
was
table
that
was
set
for
eight
when
they
were
going
to
have
dinner,
and
against
the
statement
of
the
defendant
on
the
trial
of
the
case,
nothing
to
refute
that
that
a
man
had
brought
these
films
to
him
several
days
before
and
told
him,
“i
have
some
films,
i'd
like
you
to
see.”
now,
we
say
this,
if
the
court
please,
that
wherever
we
find
that
a
question
of
obscenity
is
concerned
or
whether
or
not
we
know
that
something
is
obscene.
if
a
tells
b,
i
have
some
pictures
here
i
want
to
give
you
and
these
pictures
are
obscene.
does
that
say
that
b
cannot
determine
or
ascertain
for
himself
whether
they
are
obscene
to
him
or
does
that
mean
that
he
would
have
the
right
to
him
first
himself
inspect
those
films
and
say
i
have
a
right
under
the
first
amendment
to
determine
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
well,
that
is
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that's
correct.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that's
right.
and
that's
why
i
say
if
your
honor
please,
that
because
of
that,
a
man
has
right
to
determine
for
himself
if
it
offends
him,
if
to
him
it's
obscene
because
it
would
violate
the
first
amendment
that
if
a
man
handed
me
some
films.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
none
whatsoever
except
the
fact
they
said
an
expert
testified
that
the
films
have
been
scratched,
one
of
them
was
been
wound
backwards
to
show
that
someone
had
seen
them
at
some
time
in
the
past
but
nothing
to
show
that
he
had
seen
them
or
he
had
ever
viewed
them.
and
there's
nothing
to
refute
or
rebut
his
statement
that
he
had
never
seen
them
before.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
it
was
in
a
desk
drawer
of
his
bedroom
upstairs.
and
there
was
no
set
up,
nothing
set
up,
no
screen
set
up
to
show
these
or
view
these
films.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
well
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
i
think
that
would
analogies.
so
i
would
like
to
reserve
what
time
i
have.
i
know
the
white
light
hasn't
come
on,
i
would
like
to
reserve
if
i
may
the
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
may
it
please
the
court.
with
respect
to
smith
versus
california,
that
prosecution
involved
a
bookseller
under
an
ordinance
providing
or
referring
to
booksellers.
consequently,
the
sale
--
we're
dealing
with
a
person
now
who
is
in
the
business
of
selling
books.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
in
the
roth
case
where
that
principle
was
established,
we
find
that
the
roth
case
was
a
question
of
distribution
and
in
an
instance
where
an
individual
who
is
possessing
something
that
will
admittedly
say
as
pornographic,
the
constitution
does
not
protect
him
from
the
distribution
and
this
is
followed
in
the
redrup
case.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that's
correct.
but
the
case
was
dealing
with
a
question
of
the
distribution.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that's
correct.
the
case
does
not
hold
that
bare
possession
or
mere
possession
was
not
protected.
the
court
said
in
roth
that
obscenity
was
not
protected
but
they
were
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
the
critical
fact
is
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
because
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
well,
in
the
distribution,
you're
dealing
with
a
question
of
furnishing
it
to
others
and
the
mere
possession
in
your
own
privacy
of
your
own
home
where
no
one
else
has
seen
it.
there's
no
evidence
that
anyone
has
or
no
one
else
is
intended
to
come
into
contact
with
it,
i
say
that
no
case
holds
that
it
is
not
protected,
that
an
individual
cannot
take
a
picture
of
his
whole
obscenity
and
for
posterity
for
himself
if
he
so
chooses,
because
to
do
so,
to
prohibit
a
person
from
possessing
it
would
in
itself
violate
first
amendment
rights.
because
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that
in
itself
--
that
in
itself
would
be
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
to
say
that
a
person
could
not
write
what
he
wants
in
his
own
diary
let's
say,
that
he's
going
to
keep
for
his
own
personal
future
in
his
own
drawer
not
to
be
shown
to
any
other
persons,
we
say
that
the
first
amendment
is
an
absolute
amendment
that
gives
the
man
the
freedom
of
the
press
and
the
freedom
the
press
carries
with
it,
the
freedom
of
motion
picture
films.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
but
that
was
held
in
the
roth
case,
if
your
honor
please,
and
the
roth
case
involves.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that's
right.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
then
we
come
in
to
the
redrup
case.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
well
then
we
come
in
to
the
redrup
case
which
was
decided
since
roth
and
this
court
last
year
in
redrup
and
the
other
cases
that
went
with
it
reversed
on
the
theory
and
on
the
principle,
that
there
had
been
--
that
this
was
not
a
case
involving
one
of
the
three
elements,
either
distribution
to
minors,
distribution
to
persons
who
are
unwilling
to
see
it,
or
pandering
as
was
held
in
ginsberg.
now,
if
we
accept
redrup
as
being
the
law,
then
of
course
we
must
take
redrup
and
roth
together
as
they
both
hold
and
say
that
obscenity
insofar
as
it's
mere
possession
and
bare
possession,
to
use
that
expression,
the
bare
possession
is
concerned,
would
be
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
because
there
you
are
not
intruding
upon
the
privacy
or
the
rights
of
others
to
be
free
from
this
stuff.
now,
in
the
finding
--
one
thing
i
would
like
to
answer
my
opponent
with
respect
to,
he
says
that
the
state
court
found
that
the
state
statute
did
not
remove
the
element
of
scienter.
now,
the
rule
as
i
understand
it
is
that
this
court
will
accept
an
interpretation
placed
upon
a
state
court
as
to
a
non-federal
ground.
but
as
to
a
federal
constitutional
ground,
this
court
is
not
precluded
by
virtue
of
a
holding
of
a
state
court
on
a
constitutional
issue
from
reversing
that
state
court
because
this
is
the
final
arbiter.
this
court
is
the
one
that
must
decide
the
federal
ground.
now,
secondly,
in
the
brief
of
the
appellee
on
page
45,
he
cites
the
case
of
rainwater
versus
florida
which
was
decided
by
this
court
during
the
last
term.
the
rainwater
versus
florida
case
was
one
that
originated
in
the
state
court.
there
was
a
federal
search
warrant
issued
under
the
wagering
tax
act
(inaudible)
certain
items
from
the
defendant's
possession
and
they
prosecuted
them
in
the
state
courts.
this
court
remanded
that
under
the
theory
of
grosso
and
marchetti,
remanded
it
back
to
the
state
court
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
grosso
and
marchetti.
this
is
identical
to
the
case
we
have
here.
the
state
says
in
its
brief
that
there
the
prosecution,
the
state
court,
was
the
end-result
of
the
issuance
of
the
federal
search
warrant.
that's
what
we
have
in
this
case.
this
prosecution
for
obscenity
was
the
end-result
of
the
issuance
of
the
federal
search
warrant
which
actually
under
the
rainwater
versus
florida
doctrine
was
inadmissible
as
having
been
unconstitutionally
obtained.
now,
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
i
would
not
think
so.
i
would
not
think
--
i
think
that
the
constitution,
the
fourth
amendment
says
that
the
warrant
shall
particularly
describe
the
articles
to
be
seized.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that
is
--
that
is
my
view
of
that
amendment.
now,
one
point
was
raised
by
my
adversary.
he
says
that
the
evidence
in
the
case
indicated
that
one
reel
of
film
had
been
wound
backwards
or
was
scratched
and
that
that
would
indicate
that
someone
had
previously
viewed
that
film.
but
it
would
not
show
and
we
submit
to
this
court
that
that
fact
alone
could
not
and
would
not
show
that
this
defendant
or
this
appellant
had
ever
viewed
them.
now,
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
state
that
since
my
opponent
has
--
or
my
adversary
has
suggested
to
this
court
that
this
court
view
the
film,
he
has
in
effect
stated
that
that
how
does
this
court
know
that
they
are
obscene
without
viewing
them.
now,
that
is
our
very
position
in
this
case.
we
say
that
with
respect
to
the
appellant.
the
same
position
holds
true.
if
he
has
never
viewed
the
films,
he
would
not
obviously
know
that
they're
obscene
because
without
viewing
them,
you
cannot
learn
of
its
obscenity
and
that
is
the
point
that
we
have
in
this
case.
we
say
that
since
the
evidence
doesn't
show
that
he
ever
viewed
the
films
that
therefore
there's
no
evidence
that
he
knew,
or
could
have
known
that
they
were
obscene.
