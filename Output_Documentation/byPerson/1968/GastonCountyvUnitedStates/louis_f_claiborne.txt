mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
at
the
outset
to
try
to
put
this
case
in
a
somewhat
different
perspective.
it
seems
to
me
and
brought
to
remember
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
literacy
test
that
was
never
meant
to
serve
any
purpose
of
assuring
a
literate
electorate
but
which
was
admittedly
even
boastfully
invented
and
conceived
for
the
sole
purpose
of
keeping
the
franchise
entirely
in
white
heads.
of
that
of
course
was
a
long
time
ago
and
the
literacy
test
has
worked
its
purpose
in
that
respect
for
something
over
half
a
century.
but
we're
also
dealing
with
the
test
to
which
for
these
reasons
the
congress
recently
isolated
as
the
presumptive
cost
or
a
presumptive
cost
of
the
low
negro
registration
in
the
areas
covered
by
the
act
including
gaston
county,
north
carolina.
and
the
question
now
is
whether
after
this
history
in
light
of
the
purpose
and
effect
of
this
literacy
provision,
we
may
safely
assume
that
if
the
prohibition
were
lifted,
the
literacy
test
would
cease
to
have
a
discriminatory
effect
on
voting
in
the
county.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
light
of
this,
the
presumption
must
be
against
it.
now
it
is
true
that
north
carolina
in
gaston
county
in
particular
have
made
the
very
important
progress,
dramatic
progress
in
this
area
by
comparison
to
some
other
areas
that
i'm
more
intimately
familiar
with.
it
is
notable
that
negro
registration
in
1964
was
at
about
50%
of
those
who
are
potentially
eligible
within
the
county
and
the
record
clearly
reflects
that
commendable
efforts
were
made
at
least
in
gastonia
of
the
city
of
gaston
county
which
includes
about
a
third
of
the
population
toward
encouraging
negro
registration.
but
the
court
should
not
believe
that
all
is
well
in
the
best
of
all
possible
worlds
in
gaston
county.
it
is
a
fact
that
until
1965,
every
registrar
of
voters
was
white
and
in
that
year,
one
out
of
44
was
a
negro
appointed
however
only
to
handle
registration
in
the
predominantly
negro
section
of
gastonia.
it
is
also
revealing
that
as
late
as
1966
when
the
school,
the
high
school
has
been
referred
to
here
which
was
under
the
--
of
which
the
negro
principal,
the
witness
of
the
trial
that
high
school
was
sought
to
be
integrated
by
assigning
to
it
300
white
students
and
300
black
students,
297
of
the
white
students
transferred
out
living
only
three
of
them
in
the
school.
and
finally,
though
i
don't
want
to
put
my
chances
on
this
because
we're
dealing
with
an
elderly
man
but
he
is
still
a
registrar
of
voters
in
gaston
county.
certainly
the
millennium
has
not
come
to
this
place
when
in
this
record
we
read
the
registrar
voters
talking
about
those
who
use
registered
of
the
negro
race
as
good
niggers.
one
wonders
whether
they'd
be
registered
at
all
if
it
been
otherwise.
now
on
the
other
hand,
it
would
be
unfair
to
condemn
gaston
county
because
of
the
sins
of
the
fathers
or
grandfathers
of
those
who
are
now
the
officials
of
that
place.
but
it
would
be
equally
improper
and
unfair
to
ignore
what
subsist
of
the
influence
of
the
past
on
the
presence
that
is
after
all
the
scheme
of
the
voting
rights
act.
it
is
not
so
much
or
not
entirely
a
question
of
the
present
purpose
of
the
present
officials.
it
is
a
question
of
the
effect
and
effect
alone
is
sufficient
to
prevent
the
reinstatement
of
these
test
and
devices.
of
the
effect
that
these
tests
and
devices
have
had
in
the
recent
past
and
also
what
the
effect
would
be
if
they
were
allowed
to
be
brought
back.
so,
we
get
down
to
the
question
whether
the
influence
of
the
past
has
really
been
swept
away
with
respect
to
voting
in
gaston
county.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that's
the
figure
although
there
may
be
some
debate
whether
it
should
be
50
or
52.
in
any
event
it's
in
that
range.
that
was
figure
for
november
of
1964
at
the
time
when
this
county
was
set
aside
as
1973
act.
the
figure
today
while
it
is
not
in
the
record.
it
is
the
figure
supplied
that
to
as
far
the
state
board
of
elections
and
it
does
not
seem
to
me
relevant.
it
is
now
61%.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
61%
of
the
voting
age
negro
population
of
gaston
county.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
the
effect,
somewhat
delayed
effect
of
the
suspension
of
these
tests
or
at
least
presumptively
so.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
now,
the
voting
rights
act
itself
assumed
there's
a
general
matter
that
it
takes
at
least
five
years,
free
of
these
tests
and
devices
before
the
effects
of
the
past
have
been
fully
erased.
and
even
that
is
a
rather
optimistic
assumption
because
discrimination
for
the
better
part
of
the
century
as
this
court
well
knows
is
not
always
so
quickly
quite
a
way.
it
is
true
however
that
the
voting
rights
act
provides
that
one
need
not
wait
out
for
five
years
even
though
tests
and
devices
were
used
if
it
can
be
shown
contrary
to
the
presumption
of
the
act
that
those
tests
and
devices
did
not
have
any
effect
in
discriminating
against
the
negro
franchise
then
the
subdivision
involve
is
entitled
to
immediate
exemption.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
--
what
you
say
is
quite
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
thought
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
answer
is
that
the
presumption
of
the
act
i
think
is
that
it
takes
at
least
five
years
perhaps
longer.
now
it's
true
that
the
act
only
looks
back
to
the
preceding
five
years
but
if
in
effect
which
dates
back
20,
30,
40
years
is
still
effective
is
still
operative
five
years
before
the
suit
is
filed,
no
matter
when
the
suit
is
filed
then
exemption
is
not
proper.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
but
the
act
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
whether
it
--
after
five
years
have
elapsed
and
if
the
test
have
not
been
used
in
the
interim,
it
is
true
that
the
subdivision
is
entitled
to
exemption
even
though
they
may
be
independent
cause
for
concern
that
the
effects
of
an
old
discrimination
in
education
may
still
be
operative.
that
would
raise
the
question
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
quite
independent
of
the
voting
rights
act
but
there
are
differences
between
merely
having
the
literacy
test
suspended
in
coming
out
from
under
the
act
and
come
out
from
one
of
the
act
and
be
free
to
enact
new
laws,
section
5
of
the
act
which
this
court
tells
recently
is
not
operative
in
the
circumstance
nor
can
federal
examiners
or
federal
observers
be
sent
down
to
the
county.
so
there
is
some
point
in
winning
exemption
even
if
you
cannot
reinstitute
literacy
test
which
independent
fifteenth
amendment
reasons
would
not
be
permissible.
now
as
i
have
said,
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
wake
county
is
some
embarrassment
to
us.
as
i
understand
it,
the
investigations
of
the
department
of
justice
did
not
reveal
in
wake
county
as
it
did
here
a
wholesale
or
very
common
waiver
of
the
literacy
test
for
whites
but
not
for
negroes.
that
ground
of
objection
was
apparently
not
available
also
are
investigation
disclosed
in
wake
county.
nor
so
far
as
i
know
was
there
any
question
of
whether
municipalities
had
existed
under
a
different
regime
than
the
county
authority
is
voting
aside.
on
the
other
hand,
the
educational
disparities
will
probably
comparable
and
on
that
ground
it
may
be
that
the
attorney
general
might
have
had
equal
cause
to
object
to
the
suit
filed
by
wake
county.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
it
is
our
view
that
the
municipalities
of
are
covered
automatically
because
they
are
within
the
territory
which
is
involved
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
they
have
separate
elections
and
separate
election
officials
but
of
course
when
a
state
is
covered
as
a
whole,
the
counties
and
municipalities
are
not
separately
certified
even
though
they
have
separate
elections
and
separate
election
officials.
they've
--
become
to
the
act
because
the
principle
of
the
act
is
that
the
greater
includes
the
last
and
that
principle
is
operative
here
with
respect
to
municipalities
within
physical
territory
of
the
county.
now
in
three
respects,
it
seems
to
us
that
gaston
county
has
failed
to
meet
its
burden
of
proof
has
filed
to
convince
as
that
the
effect
of
the
literacy
test
in
so
far
as
it
discriminated
against
black
vote
has
ended.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
those
three
respects
in
which
it
seems
to
us
that
there's
been
a
failure
of
proof
by
gaston
county
all
to
outline
it
briefly
the
failure
to
make
any
showing
with
respect
to
lack
of
discrimination
in
municipal
elections.
the
evidence
showing
the
waiver
of
the
literacy
test
for
whites
on
a
wholesale
basis
or
as
the
same
to
know
it
for
negroes
and
finally
the
inevitable
unavoidable
discrimination
that
results
in
applying
a
literacy
test
to
two
groups
who
had
vastly
different
educational
opportunities.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
when
the
court
rose
yesterday,
i
had
just
summarized
the
three
respects
in
which
in
our
view
gaston
county
has
failed
in
its
proof
of
showing
that
the
application
of
literacy
test
in
that
jurisdiction
had
not
had
either
purpose
or
effect
or
discriminating
against
the
negro
franchise.
those
were
first
the
failure
to
show
that
with
respect
to
municipal
elections
carried
on
within
the
territory
of
the
county.
discrimination
had
not
occurred
within
the
preceding
five
years.
second,
a
failure
to
rebut
if
a
rebuttal
was
possible,
the
inference
of
discrimination
that
arises
from
the
fact
that
white
illiterates
were
registered
and
the
literacy
test
waived
this
to
them
whereas
same
was
not
true
with
respect
to
negro.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
stewart,
there
was
but
i
think
there
were
nine
arguably
illiterate
negroes
who
were
brought
as
witnesses
of
those
three
may
have
failed
the
test
for
some
eye
defect
rather
than
because
of
illiteracy.
two
had
apparently
memorized
the
oath
just
being
under
the
regime
of
the
oral
test
which
involved
reading
the
oath
and
to
that
extent
had
perhaps
deceived
the
registrar.
they
were
illiterates
and
the
remaining
two
or
three
year
seemed
to
have
been
true
illiterates
whose
illiteracy
may
have
been
known
to
the
registrar.
it
is
significant
that
each
of
these
nine
witnesses
came
from
precincts
7
in
gastonia,
the
one
area
predominantly
negro
where
the
policy
of
the
county
authorities
seem
to
have
been
more
lenient
toward
negro
registration
than
elsewhere.
there's
no
evidence
that
anywhere
else
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
county
are
comparable
waiver
had
take
advice.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
one-third
of
the
population
of
the
county
of
all
races
lives
within
that
city.
i
think
less
than
half
of
the
negro
population
lives
within
the
city
of
gastonia.
i'm
not
clear
whether
those
figures
are
of
record
or
not.
i
think
it
is
clear
however
that
fully
have
not
considerably
more
live
in
the
rural
areas
or
in
other
municipalities
of
the
gastonia.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
--
that
is
true
over
all
within
the
county,
i
think
it's
actually
12%
of
the
population
of
gaston
county
today
is
negro
at
one
time,
it
seems
to
have
been
considerably
larger
proportionately
than
it
is
today.
on
the
other
hand,
the
waiver
for
whites
was
clearly
a
matter
of
general
practice
throughout
the
county,
they
were
29
eyewitnesses.
well,
whose
testimony
is
taken
by
deposition
but
who
were
fairly
illiterates,
many
of
them
have
been
visited
at
their
homes
it
made
no
effort
to
register
on
their
own
and
some
at
least
one
notable
example
the
applicant
had
indicated
to
the
registrar
that
he
didn't
want
to
register
and
was
registered
nevertheless.
most
of
them
testified
that
they
had
informed
the
registrar
that
they
were
illiterate
and
nevertheless
had
been
registered.
in
addition
to
that
evidence,
the
government
introduced
registration
forms
from
70
white
applicants
which
showed
them
illiterate
in
the
full
sense
of
being
unable
to
even
sign
their
names
and
the
notations
there
which
make
it
clear
the
registrar
signed
for
them
are
sometimes
quite
candid
can't
write
as
the
explanation
sometimes
as
an
“x”
which
is
unexplained.
in
many
instances
the
notation
excusing
the
applicant
from
signing
is
too
nervous
in
some
other
instances
the
notation
is
left
glasses
at
home
--
eyeglasses.
the
government
of
course,
the
total
here
is
something
like
100,
the
government
i
think
reasonably
infers
from
this
number
who
were
willing
to
testify
or
whose
illiteracy
was
evident
from
their
inability
to
even
sign
their
names
that
the
practice
was
quite
prevalent
and
of
course
in
no
sense
limited
to
this
number
who
could
be
found
as
willing
witnesses.
now,
finally
and
we
think
gaston
county
has
failed
in
its
proof
by
failing
to
rebut
the
natural
inference
resulting
from
the
educational
disparity,
the
lack
of
equal
educational
opportunity
afforded
negro
voters
of
today
when
they
were
school
children
that
the
literacy
test
has
borne
more
heavily
on
them
and
would
continue
to
do
so.
i
want
to
make
clear
that
in
our
view
either
of
the
first
two
grounds
is
sufficient
to
support
the
judgment
denying
exemption
to
gaston
county.
on
the
other
hand,
i
proposed
to
focus
on
the
third
ground.
the
reason
for
that
is
in
part
that
the
failure
with
respect
to
proof
or
concerning
municipal
elections
while
the
sufficient
ground
does
seem
to
us
to
be
somewhat
tentative
one,
it's
a
little
--
the
tail
wagging
of
the
dog.
it
does
not
come
to
the
heart
of
the
policy
of
the
voting
rights
act.
the
second
ground
while
again
quite
sufficient
does
have
a
somewhat
punitive
character
and
that
if
in
the
past
three
years,
negro
illiterates
have
been
afforded
full
opportunity
to
come
on
the
rolls,
it
may
be
that
the
registration
of
white
illiterates
has
in
that
sense
been
cured
and
that
the
discrimination
has
in
a
real
sense
been
largely
eliminated.
now
that
is
not
the
test
under
the
act
under
so
long
as
there
has
been
discrimination
within
the
prior
five
years,
gaston
county
would
have
to
wait
another
two
years.
but
still,
it
seems
to
us
you
get
more
of
the
central
issue
to
focus
on
the
ground
which
is
the
ground
that
the
district
court,
majority
of
the
district
court
thought.
the
sound
is
on
which
to
base
his
judgment.
it
is
of
course
also
a
ground
which
presents
the
question
of
recurring
importance
which
sooner
or
later
will
have
to
come
before
the
court
in
this
case
or
another.
it
also
has
the
different
consequence.
this
appears
on
my
somewhat
inadequate
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart
yesterday.
under
the
act,
after
the
five
years
are
up
and
jurisdiction
wins
the
exemption,
there
is
an
additional
five-year
period
during
which
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
is
retained
and
the
court
is
instructed
to
entertain
an
application
by
the
attorney
general
during
that
period
under
the
same
standards
as
would
have
applied
during
the
previous
five-year
period.
and
if
the
effect
of
the
disparity
with
respect
to
education
were
continuing
in
the
second
five-year
period,
there
would
then
be
justification
for
a
suit
of
that
kind.
and
that
would
be,
that
probability
seems
likely
only
with
respect
to
the
state
ground.
so
the
basis
of
the
judgment
may
have
a
very
important
practical
impact.
and
finally,
this
third
ground
looks
in
one
sense
to
the
past
that
is
the
educational
disparity.
on
the
other
hand,
it
quite
realistically
looks
to
the
future
unlikely
through
the
priority
grounds.
in
the
sense
that
what
is
being
tested
here
is
whether
the
discrimination
of
the
past
still
has
a
lingering
effect
and
will
in
years
to
come
for
that
reason
not
because
the
education
of
disparity
has
had
a
discriminatory
effect
but
because
it
will
continue
to
have
for
some
time
to
come,
it
seems
to
us
that
this
basis
for
the
judgment
is
the
one
that
ought
to
be
focused
on.
it
seems
to
us
also
that
this
ground
of
position
is
faithful
to
the
legislative
intent.
we
must
remember
that
at
the
time
the
suspension
of
test
was
proposed
in
the
congress,
the
argument
ran
that
that
was
an
unnecessary
radical
procedure
that
it
was
quite
sufficient
if
the
complaint
were
that
the
illiterates,
white
illiterates
have
been
registered
and
that
same
privilege
with
the
non-negroes.
the
way
to
cure
that
was
to
require
or
at
least
offer
the
states
the
alternative
of
the
complete
re-registration.
the
answer
made
to
that
suggestion
by
the
attorney
general
and
reproduce
to
both
committee
reports
is
that
--
that
would
not
have
solved
the
problem
because
the
reinstruction
of
the
literacy
test
would
bear
more
heavily
on
the
negro
voters
precisely
because
they
have
denied
the
same
educational
opportunities.
so
we're
dealing
here
with
a
grounded
decision
which
the
congress
itself
focused
on.
now
i
must
concede
as
justice
stewart
pointed
out
yesterday
that
the
result
of
this
argument
is
one
that
the
congress
apparently
did
not
fully
appreciate
at
the
time.
but
there
are
several
things
that
are
to
be
said
about
that.
first,
the
act
is
i
think
i
pointed
out
yesterday
does
not
deal
merely
with
literacy
test.
it
also
suspends
other
test
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
educational
disparities
and
it
also
has
other
provisions
with
respect
to
enactment
of
new
laws,
sending
to
federal
examiners,
federal
observers
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
his
educational
disparities.
also,
five-year
period
was
in
the
end
simply
a
legislative
compromise.
congress
seem
not
to
have
quite
focus
on
what
would
happen
into
the
five-year
period.
it's
rather
unthinkable
for
instance
that
having
allowed
thousands
of
illiterate
negro
voters
in
the
south
to
become
registered
thanks
to
this
federal
act,
the
congress
intended
to
permit
that
suddenly
they
should
be
purged
from
the
rolls
after
five
years
had
gone
by.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
short
of
an
objection
on
this
ground
or
on
the
50
(inaudible).
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
after
five
years,
the
act
itself
would
not
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
--
that
is
correct.
i
think
what
we
must
say
is
that
the
congress
didn't
look
that
far
ahead.
it
assumed
that
the
act
would
be
extended.
all
of
the
courts
would
intervene
and
they
did
provide
in
this
additional
five-year
period
that
i
was
speaking
of
for
the
courts
to
intervene
when
the
act
otherwise
expired.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
the
legislative
scheme.
now,
it
is
perfectly
obvious
that
this
literacy
test
that
reinstituted
will
bear
more
heavily
on
the
negro.
that
is
true
because
fewer
negroes
went
to
school
at
all
twice
as
many
negroes
who
never
went
to
school
in
gaston
county.
it
is
true
because
few
of
them
than
whites
stayed
long
enough
to
obtain
the
necessary
literacy
again
almost
twice
as
many
be
grosser
in
that
position
as
whites
and
that
for
30%
of
the
negroes
in
gaston
county
never
got
beyond
the
fourth
grade.
and
finally,
they
mind
less
when
they
were
there.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
of
course.
now
some
of
these
results
are
directly
attributable
to
state
actions,
some
are
not.
of
course,
economic
necessity
made
many
negroes
quit
school
sooner
than
whites.
also,
the
incentives
for
learning
or
for
staying
in
school
or
for
learning
while
there
was
a
great
deal
of
lesson
in
the
case
of
negro
30
or
40
years
in
gaston
county
with
no
purpose
to
obtain
an
education
that
only
a
few
children
the
(inaudible)
is
not
my
point
in
obtaining
an
education.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
would
so
argue
if
it
were
so
necessary.
here
it
is
so
clear
that
the
state
in
local
governments
do
bear
some
responsibility
from
the
lower
literacy
of
the
negro
that
i
need
not
make
that
argument.
i
think
the
act
says
when
the
effect
is
to
bear
more
heavily
on
the
negro
franchise,
it
is
a
forbidden
test
especially
so
when
it
is
designed
at
the
chosen
with
black
reality
in
mind
as
this
literacy
test
was
originally
and
presumably
that's
the
reason
it
was
continued.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
we
do
say
that
justice
fortas
but
again,
we
don't
quite
have
to
go
that
far.
here
there's
a
violation
that
not
only
of
brown
versus
the
board
but
also
plessy
versus
ferguson.
not
only
with
the
education
segregated
but
it
was
grossly
unequal,
35%
of
the
present
day
voting
age
negro
population
went
to
school
before
1918,
50%
of
that
present
day
voting
age
population
went
to
school
before
1930,
therefore
performance
of
jeffers,
the
plaintiff's
expert
knew
anything
about
it.
50%
of
--
in
the
period
preceding
1918
less
than
one-fifth
of
the
money
spent
on
white
teacher
salaries
were
spent
on
negro
teacher
salaries.
result
was
that
95%
of
the
negro
teacher
had
second
class
certificates,
whereas,
most
of
the
white
teachers
have
first
class
certificates.
this
negro
education
in
that
day
was
in
large
part,
in
one
classroom
with
all
grades
taught
together.
money
of
course
is
not
the
full
as
of
education
but
as
we
well
know,
it
can
have
a
very
serious
practical
impact
on
the
quality
of
education
that
results.
and
finally,
let
me
say
that
what
we
should
be
comparing
here
is
true
that
this
last
test
was
relatively
easy
test.
you
must
remember
that
there
was
oral
test
for
two
years
before
that
which
was
not
so
easy
it
involved
reading
a
long
oath.
but
what
we
should
compare
is
not
high
school
graduates
about
races
or
even
elementary
school
graduates
for
--
of
both
races
but
those
who
only
went
to
school
for
one
or
two
or
three
or
four
years
as
to
them
even
the
slightest
disparity
would
result
in
one
group
being
able
to
past
the
test
and
the
other
not.
and
we
know
as
i
have
just
indicated
that
there
are
many
in
that
category
in
gaston
county
who
were
only
able
of
reason
or
another
to
attend
school
for
this
short-term.
finally,
let
me
say
that
the
suspension
of
the
test
has
had
though
belatedly
a
very
substantial
practical
impact
that
has
now
been
a
25%
increase
in
negro
registration
in
the
county
out
of
originally
some
4,100
negroes
registered,
there
are
now
5,100
negro
registered,
a
thousand
increased
on
this
small
number
which
is
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
correct
but
that
were
exact
to
a
25%.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
assume
it
does,
mr.
justice
stewart,
my
mathematics
are
delinquent.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
at
the
outset
to
try
to
put
this
case
in
a
somewhat
different
perspective.
it
seems
to
me
and
brought
to
remember
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
literacy
test
that
was
never
meant
to
serve
any
purpose
of
assuring
a
literate
electorate
but
which
was
admittedly
even
boastfully
invented
and
conceived
for
the
sole
purpose
of
keeping
the
franchise
entirely
in
white
heads.
of
that
of
course
was
a
long
time
ago
and
the
literacy
test
has
worked
its
purpose
in
that
respect
for
something
over
half
a
century.
but
we're
also
dealing
with
the
test
to
which
for
these
reasons
the
congress
recently
isolated
as
the
presumptive
cost
or
a
presumptive
cost
of
the
low
negro
registration
in
the
areas
covered
by
the
act
including
gaston
county,
north
carolina.
and
the
question
now
is
whether
after
this
history
in
light
of
the
purpose
and
effect
of
this
literacy
provision,
we
may
safely
assume
that
if
the
prohibition
were
lifted,
the
literacy
test
would
cease
to
have
a
discriminatory
effect
on
voting
in
the
county.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
light
of
this,
the
presumption
must
be
against
it.
now
it
is
true
that
north
carolina
in
gaston
county
in
particular
have
made
the
very
important
progress,
dramatic
progress
in
this
area
by
comparison
to
some
other
areas
that
i'm
more
intimately
familiar
with.
it
is
notable
that
negro
registration
in
1964
was
at
about
50%
of
those
who
are
potentially
eligible
within
the
county
and
the
record
clearly
reflects
that
commendable
efforts
were
made
at
least
in
gastonia
of
the
city
of
gaston
county
which
includes
about
a
third
of
the
population
toward
encouraging
negro
registration.
but
the
court
should
not
believe
that
all
is
well
in
the
best
of
all
possible
worlds
in
gaston
county.
it
is
a
fact
that
until
1965,
every
registrar
of
voters
was
white
and
in
that
year,
one
out
of
44
was
a
negro
appointed
however
only
to
handle
registration
in
the
predominantly
negro
section
of
gastonia.
it
is
also
revealing
that
as
late
as
1966
when
the
school,
the
high
school
has
been
referred
to
here
which
was
under
the
--
of
which
the
negro
principal,
the
witness
of
the
trial
that
high
school
was
sought
to
be
integrated
by
assigning
to
it
300
white
students
and
300
black
students,
297
of
the
white
students
transferred
out
living
only
three
of
them
in
the
school.
and
finally,
though
i
don't
want
to
put
my
chances
on
this
because
we're
dealing
with
an
elderly
man
but
he
is
still
a
registrar
of
voters
in
gaston
county.
certainly
the
millennium
has
not
come
to
this
place
when
in
this
record
we
read
the
registrar
voters
talking
about
those
who
use
registered
of
the
negro
race
as
good
niggers.
one
wonders
whether
they'd
be
registered
at
all
if
it
been
otherwise.
now
on
the
other
hand,
it
would
be
unfair
to
condemn
gaston
county
because
of
the
sins
of
the
fathers
or
grandfathers
of
those
who
are
now
the
officials
of
that
place.
but
it
would
be
equally
improper
and
unfair
to
ignore
what
subsist
of
the
influence
of
the
past
on
the
presence
that
is
after
all
the
scheme
of
the
voting
rights
act.
it
is
not
so
much
or
not
entirely
a
question
of
the
present
purpose
of
the
present
officials.
it
is
a
question
of
the
effect
and
effect
alone
is
sufficient
to
prevent
the
reinstatement
of
these
test
and
devices.
of
the
effect
that
these
tests
and
devices
have
had
in
the
recent
past
and
also
what
the
effect
would
be
if
they
were
allowed
to
be
brought
back.
so,
we
get
down
to
the
question
whether
the
influence
of
the
past
has
really
been
swept
away
with
respect
to
voting
in
gaston
county.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that's
the
figure
although
there
may
be
some
debate
whether
it
should
be
50
or
52.
in
any
event
it's
in
that
range.
that
was
figure
for
november
of
1964
at
the
time
when
this
county
was
set
aside
as
1973
act.
the
figure
today
while
it
is
not
in
the
record.
it
is
the
figure
supplied
that
to
as
far
the
state
board
of
elections
and
it
does
not
seem
to
me
relevant.
it
is
now
61%.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
61%
of
the
voting
age
negro
population
of
gaston
county.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
the
effect,
somewhat
delayed
effect
of
the
suspension
of
these
tests
or
at
least
presumptively
so.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
now,
the
voting
rights
act
itself
assumed
there's
a
general
matter
that
it
takes
at
least
five
years,
free
of
these
tests
and
devices
before
the
effects
of
the
past
have
been
fully
erased.
and
even
that
is
a
rather
optimistic
assumption
because
discrimination
for
the
better
part
of
the
century
as
this
court
well
knows
is
not
always
so
quickly
quite
a
way.
it
is
true
however
that
the
voting
rights
act
provides
that
one
need
not
wait
out
for
five
years
even
though
tests
and
devices
were
used
if
it
can
be
shown
contrary
to
the
presumption
of
the
act
that
those
tests
and
devices
did
not
have
any
effect
in
discriminating
against
the
negro
franchise
then
the
subdivision
involve
is
entitled
to
immediate
exemption.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
--
what
you
say
is
quite
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
thought
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
answer
is
that
the
presumption
of
the
act
i
think
is
that
it
takes
at
least
five
years
perhaps
longer.
now
it's
true
that
the
act
only
looks
back
to
the
preceding
five
years
but
if
in
effect
which
dates
back
20,
30,
40
years
is
still
effective
is
still
operative
five
years
before
the
suit
is
filed,
no
matter
when
the
suit
is
filed
then
exemption
is
not
proper.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
but
the
act
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
whether
it
--
after
five
years
have
elapsed
and
if
the
test
have
not
been
used
in
the
interim,
it
is
true
that
the
subdivision
is
entitled
to
exemption
even
though
they
may
be
independent
cause
for
concern
that
the
effects
of
an
old
discrimination
in
education
may
still
be
operative.
that
would
raise
the
question
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
quite
independent
of
the
voting
rights
act
but
there
are
differences
between
merely
having
the
literacy
test
suspended
in
coming
out
from
under
the
act
and
come
out
from
one
of
the
act
and
be
free
to
enact
new
laws,
section
5
of
the
act
which
this
court
tells
recently
is
not
operative
in
the
circumstance
nor
can
federal
examiners
or
federal
observers
be
sent
down
to
the
county.
so
there
is
some
point
in
winning
exemption
even
if
you
cannot
reinstitute
literacy
test
which
independent
fifteenth
amendment
reasons
would
not
be
permissible.
now
as
i
have
said,
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
wake
county
is
some
embarrassment
to
us.
as
i
understand
it,
the
investigations
of
the
department
of
justice
did
not
reveal
in
wake
county
as
it
did
here
a
wholesale
or
very
common
waiver
of
the
literacy
test
for
whites
but
not
for
negroes.
that
ground
of
objection
was
apparently
not
available
also
are
investigation
disclosed
in
wake
county.
nor
so
far
as
i
know
was
there
any
question
of
whether
municipalities
had
existed
under
a
different
regime
than
the
county
authority
is
voting
aside.
on
the
other
hand,
the
educational
disparities
will
probably
comparable
and
on
that
ground
it
may
be
that
the
attorney
general
might
have
had
equal
cause
to
object
to
the
suit
filed
by
wake
county.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
it
is
our
view
that
the
municipalities
of
are
covered
automatically
because
they
are
within
the
territory
which
is
involved
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
they
have
separate
elections
and
separate
election
officials
but
of
course
when
a
state
is
covered
as
a
whole,
the
counties
and
municipalities
are
not
separately
certified
even
though
they
have
separate
elections
and
separate
election
officials.
they've
--
become
to
the
act
because
the
principle
of
the
act
is
that
the
greater
includes
the
last
and
that
principle
is
operative
here
with
respect
to
municipalities
within
physical
territory
of
the
county.
now
in
three
respects,
it
seems
to
us
that
gaston
county
has
failed
to
meet
its
burden
of
proof
has
filed
to
convince
as
that
the
effect
of
the
literacy
test
in
so
far
as
it
discriminated
against
black
vote
has
ended.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
those
three
respects
in
which
it
seems
to
us
that
there's
been
a
failure
of
proof
by
gaston
county
all
to
outline
it
briefly
the
failure
to
make
any
showing
with
respect
to
lack
of
discrimination
in
municipal
elections.
the
evidence
showing
the
waiver
of
the
literacy
test
for
whites
on
a
wholesale
basis
or
as
the
same
to
know
it
for
negroes
and
finally
the
inevitable
unavoidable
discrimination
that
results
in
applying
a
literacy
test
to
two
groups
who
had
vastly
different
educational
opportunities.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
when
the
court
rose
yesterday,
i
had
just
summarized
the
three
respects
in
which
in
our
view
gaston
county
has
failed
in
its
proof
of
showing
that
the
application
of
literacy
test
in
that
jurisdiction
had
not
had
either
purpose
or
effect
or
discriminating
against
the
negro
franchise.
those
were
first
the
failure
to
show
that
with
respect
to
municipal
elections
carried
on
within
the
territory
of
the
county.
discrimination
had
not
occurred
within
the
preceding
five
years.
second,
a
failure
to
rebut
if
a
rebuttal
was
possible,
the
inference
of
discrimination
that
arises
from
the
fact
that
white
illiterates
were
registered
and
the
literacy
test
waived
this
to
them
whereas
same
was
not
true
with
respect
to
negro.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
stewart,
there
was
but
i
think
there
were
nine
arguably
illiterate
negroes
who
were
brought
as
witnesses
of
those
three
may
have
failed
the
test
for
some
eye
defect
rather
than
because
of
illiteracy.
two
had
apparently
memorized
the
oath
just
being
under
the
regime
of
the
oral
test
which
involved
reading
the
oath
and
to
that
extent
had
perhaps
deceived
the
registrar.
they
were
illiterates
and
the
remaining
two
or
three
year
seemed
to
have
been
true
illiterates
whose
illiteracy
may
have
been
known
to
the
registrar.
it
is
significant
that
each
of
these
nine
witnesses
came
from
precincts
7
in
gastonia,
the
one
area
predominantly
negro
where
the
policy
of
the
county
authorities
seem
to
have
been
more
lenient
toward
negro
registration
than
elsewhere.
there's
no
evidence
that
anywhere
else
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
county
are
comparable
waiver
had
take
advice.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
one-third
of
the
population
of
the
county
of
all
races
lives
within
that
city.
i
think
less
than
half
of
the
negro
population
lives
within
the
city
of
gastonia.
i'm
not
clear
whether
those
figures
are
of
record
or
not.
i
think
it
is
clear
however
that
fully
have
not
considerably
more
live
in
the
rural
areas
or
in
other
municipalities
of
the
gastonia.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
--
that
is
true
over
all
within
the
county,
i
think
it's
actually
12%
of
the
population
of
gaston
county
today
is
negro
at
one
time,
it
seems
to
have
been
considerably
larger
proportionately
than
it
is
today.
on
the
other
hand,
the
waiver
for
whites
was
clearly
a
matter
of
general
practice
throughout
the
county,
they
were
29
eyewitnesses.
well,
whose
testimony
is
taken
by
deposition
but
who
were
fairly
illiterates,
many
of
them
have
been
visited
at
their
homes
it
made
no
effort
to
register
on
their
own
and
some
at
least
one
notable
example
the
applicant
had
indicated
to
the
registrar
that
he
didn't
want
to
register
and
was
registered
nevertheless.
most
of
them
testified
that
they
had
informed
the
registrar
that
they
were
illiterate
and
nevertheless
had
been
registered.
in
addition
to
that
evidence,
the
government
introduced
registration
forms
from
70
white
applicants
which
showed
them
illiterate
in
the
full
sense
of
being
unable
to
even
sign
their
names
and
the
notations
there
which
make
it
clear
the
registrar
signed
for
them
are
sometimes
quite
candid
can't
write
as
the
explanation
sometimes
as
an
“x”
which
is
unexplained.
in
many
instances
the
notation
excusing
the
applicant
from
signing
is
too
nervous
in
some
other
instances
the
notation
is
left
glasses
at
home
--
eyeglasses.
the
government
of
course,
the
total
here
is
something
like
100,
the
government
i
think
reasonably
infers
from
this
number
who
were
willing
to
testify
or
whose
illiteracy
was
evident
from
their
inability
to
even
sign
their
names
that
the
practice
was
quite
prevalent
and
of
course
in
no
sense
limited
to
this
number
who
could
be
found
as
willing
witnesses.
now,
finally
and
we
think
gaston
county
has
failed
in
its
proof
by
failing
to
rebut
the
natural
inference
resulting
from
the
educational
disparity,
the
lack
of
equal
educational
opportunity
afforded
negro
voters
of
today
when
they
were
school
children
that
the
literacy
test
has
borne
more
heavily
on
them
and
would
continue
to
do
so.
i
want
to
make
clear
that
in
our
view
either
of
the
first
two
grounds
is
sufficient
to
support
the
judgment
denying
exemption
to
gaston
county.
on
the
other
hand,
i
proposed
to
focus
on
the
third
ground.
the
reason
for
that
is
in
part
that
the
failure
with
respect
to
proof
or
concerning
municipal
elections
while
the
sufficient
ground
does
seem
to
us
to
be
somewhat
tentative
one,
it's
a
little
--
the
tail
wagging
of
the
dog.
it
does
not
come
to
the
heart
of
the
policy
of
the
voting
rights
act.
the
second
ground
while
again
quite
sufficient
does
have
a
somewhat
punitive
character
and
that
if
in
the
past
three
years,
negro
illiterates
have
been
afforded
full
opportunity
to
come
on
the
rolls,
it
may
be
that
the
registration
of
white
illiterates
has
in
that
sense
been
cured
and
that
the
discrimination
has
in
a
real
sense
been
largely
eliminated.
now
that
is
not
the
test
under
the
act
under
so
long
as
there
has
been
discrimination
within
the
prior
five
years,
gaston
county
would
have
to
wait
another
two
years.
but
still,
it
seems
to
us
you
get
more
of
the
central
issue
to
focus
on
the
ground
which
is
the
ground
that
the
district
court,
majority
of
the
district
court
thought.
the
sound
is
on
which
to
base
his
judgment.
it
is
of
course
also
a
ground
which
presents
the
question
of
recurring
importance
which
sooner
or
later
will
have
to
come
before
the
court
in
this
case
or
another.
it
also
has
the
different
consequence.
this
appears
on
my
somewhat
inadequate
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart
yesterday.
under
the
act,
after
the
five
years
are
up
and
jurisdiction
wins
the
exemption,
there
is
an
additional
five-year
period
during
which
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
is
retained
and
the
court
is
instructed
to
entertain
an
application
by
the
attorney
general
during
that
period
under
the
same
standards
as
would
have
applied
during
the
previous
five-year
period.
and
if
the
effect
of
the
disparity
with
respect
to
education
were
continuing
in
the
second
five-year
period,
there
would
then
be
justification
for
a
suit
of
that
kind.
and
that
would
be,
that
probability
seems
likely
only
with
respect
to
the
state
ground.
so
the
basis
of
the
judgment
may
have
a
very
important
practical
impact.
and
finally,
this
third
ground
looks
in
one
sense
to
the
past
that
is
the
educational
disparity.
on
the
other
hand,
it
quite
realistically
looks
to
the
future
unlikely
through
the
priority
grounds.
in
the
sense
that
what
is
being
tested
here
is
whether
the
discrimination
of
the
past
still
has
a
lingering
effect
and
will
in
years
to
come
for
that
reason
not
because
the
education
of
disparity
has
had
a
discriminatory
effect
but
because
it
will
continue
to
have
for
some
time
to
come,
it
seems
to
us
that
this
basis
for
the
judgment
is
the
one
that
ought
to
be
focused
on.
it
seems
to
us
also
that
this
ground
of
position
is
faithful
to
the
legislative
intent.
we
must
remember
that
at
the
time
the
suspension
of
test
was
proposed
in
the
congress,
the
argument
ran
that
that
was
an
unnecessary
radical
procedure
that
it
was
quite
sufficient
if
the
complaint
were
that
the
illiterates,
white
illiterates
have
been
registered
and
that
same
privilege
with
the
non-negroes.
the
way
to
cure
that
was
to
require
or
at
least
offer
the
states
the
alternative
of
the
complete
re-registration.
the
answer
made
to
that
suggestion
by
the
attorney
general
and
reproduce
to
both
committee
reports
is
that
--
that
would
not
have
solved
the
problem
because
the
reinstruction
of
the
literacy
test
would
bear
more
heavily
on
the
negro
voters
precisely
because
they
have
denied
the
same
educational
opportunities.
so
we're
dealing
here
with
a
grounded
decision
which
the
congress
itself
focused
on.
now
i
must
concede
as
justice
stewart
pointed
out
yesterday
that
the
result
of
this
argument
is
one
that
the
congress
apparently
did
not
fully
appreciate
at
the
time.
but
there
are
several
things
that
are
to
be
said
about
that.
first,
the
act
is
i
think
i
pointed
out
yesterday
does
not
deal
merely
with
literacy
test.
it
also
suspends
other
test
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
educational
disparities
and
it
also
has
other
provisions
with
respect
to
enactment
of
new
laws,
sending
to
federal
examiners,
federal
observers
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
his
educational
disparities.
also,
five-year
period
was
in
the
end
simply
a
legislative
compromise.
congress
seem
not
to
have
quite
focus
on
what
would
happen
into
the
five-year
period.
it's
rather
unthinkable
for
instance
that
having
allowed
thousands
of
illiterate
negro
voters
in
the
south
to
become
registered
thanks
to
this
federal
act,
the
congress
intended
to
permit
that
suddenly
they
should
be
purged
from
the
rolls
after
five
years
had
gone
by.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
short
of
an
objection
on
this
ground
or
on
the
50
(inaudible).
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
after
five
years,
the
act
itself
would
not
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
--
that
is
correct.
i
think
what
we
must
say
is
that
the
congress
didn't
look
that
far
ahead.
it
assumed
that
the
act
would
be
extended.
all
of
the
courts
would
intervene
and
they
did
provide
in
this
additional
five-year
period
that
i
was
speaking
of
for
the
courts
to
intervene
when
the
act
otherwise
expired.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
the
legislative
scheme.
now,
it
is
perfectly
obvious
that
this
literacy
test
that
reinstituted
will
bear
more
heavily
on
the
negro.
that
is
true
because
fewer
negroes
went
to
school
at
all
twice
as
many
negroes
who
never
went
to
school
in
gaston
county.
it
is
true
because
few
of
them
than
whites
stayed
long
enough
to
obtain
the
necessary
literacy
again
almost
twice
as
many
be
grosser
in
that
position
as
whites
and
that
for
30%
of
the
negroes
in
gaston
county
never
got
beyond
the
fourth
grade.
and
finally,
they
mind
less
when
they
were
there.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
of
course.
now
some
of
these
results
are
directly
attributable
to
state
actions,
some
are
not.
of
course,
economic
necessity
made
many
negroes
quit
school
sooner
than
whites.
also,
the
incentives
for
learning
or
for
staying
in
school
or
for
learning
while
there
was
a
great
deal
of
lesson
in
the
case
of
negro
30
or
40
years
in
gaston
county
with
no
purpose
to
obtain
an
education
that
only
a
few
children
the
(inaudible)
is
not
my
point
in
obtaining
an
education.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
would
so
argue
if
it
were
so
necessary.
here
it
is
so
clear
that
the
state
in
local
governments
do
bear
some
responsibility
from
the
lower
literacy
of
the
negro
that
i
need
not
make
that
argument.
i
think
the
act
says
when
the
effect
is
to
bear
more
heavily
on
the
negro
franchise,
it
is
a
forbidden
test
especially
so
when
it
is
designed
at
the
chosen
with
black
reality
in
mind
as
this
literacy
test
was
originally
and
presumably
that's
the
reason
it
was
continued.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
we
do
say
that
justice
fortas
but
again,
we
don't
quite
have
to
go
that
far.
here
there's
a
violation
that
not
only
of
brown
versus
the
board
but
also
plessy
versus
ferguson.
not
only
with
the
education
segregated
but
it
was
grossly
unequal,
35%
of
the
present
day
voting
age
negro
population
went
to
school
before
1918,
50%
of
that
present
day
voting
age
population
went
to
school
before
1930,
therefore
performance
of
jeffers,
the
plaintiff's
expert
knew
anything
about
it.
50%
of
--
in
the
period
preceding
1918
less
than
one-fifth
of
the
money
spent
on
white
teacher
salaries
were
spent
on
negro
teacher
salaries.
result
was
that
95%
of
the
negro
teacher
had
second
class
certificates,
whereas,
most
of
the
white
teachers
have
first
class
certificates.
this
negro
education
in
that
day
was
in
large
part,
in
one
classroom
with
all
grades
taught
together.
money
of
course
is
not
the
full
as
of
education
but
as
we
well
know,
it
can
have
a
very
serious
practical
impact
on
the
quality
of
education
that
results.
and
finally,
let
me
say
that
what
we
should
be
comparing
here
is
true
that
this
last
test
was
relatively
easy
test.
you
must
remember
that
there
was
oral
test
for
two
years
before
that
which
was
not
so
easy
it
involved
reading
a
long
oath.
but
what
we
should
compare
is
not
high
school
graduates
about
races
or
even
elementary
school
graduates
for
--
of
both
races
but
those
who
only
went
to
school
for
one
or
two
or
three
or
four
years
as
to
them
even
the
slightest
disparity
would
result
in
one
group
being
able
to
past
the
test
and
the
other
not.
and
we
know
as
i
have
just
indicated
that
there
are
many
in
that
category
in
gaston
county
who
were
only
able
of
reason
or
another
to
attend
school
for
this
short-term.
finally,
let
me
say
that
the
suspension
of
the
test
has
had
though
belatedly
a
very
substantial
practical
impact
that
has
now
been
a
25%
increase
in
negro
registration
in
the
county
out
of
originally
some
4,100
negroes
registered,
there
are
now
5,100
negro
registered,
a
thousand
increased
on
this
small
number
which
is
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
correct
but
that
were
exact
to
a
25%.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
assume
it
does,
mr.
justice
stewart,
my
mathematics
are
delinquent.
