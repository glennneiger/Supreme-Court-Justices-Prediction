the
point
about
that
testimony
was
that
the
witness
had
become
familiar
with
the
schools
only
in
the
early
1930s
and
a
good
many
of
the
older
voters
of
course
would
have
gone
to
school
before
that
time

this
witness
accepting
fully
the

of
what
he
testified
to
simply
did
not

the

prior

the
1930s.
