mr.
grady
b.
scott
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
came
to
this
court
from
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia.
the
case
was
heard
in
the
district
court
here
in
washington
before
judges
wright,
robinson,
and
gasch.
the
opinion
of
these
justices
was
a
two-judge
--
the
two
of
the
judges
wrote
an
opinion
which
we
contend
first
of
all
was
based
on
a
theory
that
was
not
justified
under
the
1965
voting
rights
act.
the
concurring
opinion
of
judge
gasch
was
based
on
a
different
theory,
a
theory
that
because
the
gaston
county
had
failed
to
maybe
offer
evidence
that
we
did
not
discriminate
by
the
use
of
a
test
or
device
in
municipal
elections.
the
record
is
amply
showed
that
the
municipal
elections
of
course
were
not
under
the
control
of
the
county
board
of
elections.
so
just
to
give
a
brief
background,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
it
was
in
march
of
1966
that
we
were
certified
by
the
attorney
general
and
subsequently
at
that
time
was
printed
in
the
federal
registry
and
in
august
of
1966,
we
filed
a
suit
in
the
district
court
and
it
was
heard
here
in
june
21
and
22
of
the
following
year.
these
two
opinions
after
having
been
handed
down,
we
appeal
to
this
court
in
probable
jurisdiction
was
then
noted
on
january
13,
1969.
the
three
main
points
that
we
would
like
to
argue
in
connection
with
this
case
is
first
of
all
that
gaston
county
and
the
record
we
contend
is
replete
without
offset
we
at
no
time
have
used
a
test
or
device
to
discriminate
because
of
race
and
color
or
for
any
other
reasons.
we
set
out
in
the
record.
we
brought
witnesses
here
to
washington
both
the
white
and
negro
race
to
show
to
the
court
that
this
particular
county
in
north
carolina
was
not
one
that
this
act
was
designed
for.
in
reading
the
case,
of
course
of
south
carolina
against
katzenbach
in
which
the
history
of
this
whole
act
or
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
set
forth
in
stating
that
the
repressive
type
of
thing
that
was
going
on
in
some
other
states
in
the
union
to
at
least
try
to
avoid
that
type
of
conduct
continuing.
we
contend
that
gaston
county
does
not
fall
into
that
same
category.
so
we
then
presented
evidence.
we
brought
with
us
these
witnesses
who
testified
orally
the
government
offered
depositions
without
any
oral
testimony.
both
parties
to
the
action
did
offer
depositions.
i
believe
that
the
government
offered
at
29
depositions
plus
some
other
documentary
evidence.
we
offer
depositions
of
about
9
or
11
people
i
believe.
now
we
first
in
the
record,
it
will
indicate
that
in
1962,
a
new
registration
was
adopted
in
gaston
county
and
this
was
a
system
called
a
permanent
loose-leaf
type
registration.
until
that
time,
we
had
had,
well
i
guess
it
may
be
at
1940
was
the
only
other
time
that
anything
it
had
been
done
about
the
registration
books.
but
in
1962,
a
complete
new
registration
was
ordered
called
the
mcmillan
system
and
it
was
by
statute
that
we
adopted
this
system
in
north
carolina.
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
elections
at
that
time,
starting
in
april
and
from
april
until
may
of
1962
conducted
a
registration
so
that
the
voters
would
be
eligible
to
vote
in
the
may
primary
of
1962
that
the
evidence
will
probably
indicate
that
during
that
short
period
of
time,
we
registered
in
our
county
approximately
30
some
thousand
people.
it
was
a
rounded
figure,
i
am
not
exact
about
that
but
approximately
30,000
people
which
we
might
say
was
in
a
period
of
approximately
15
days
and
three
saturdays
within
that
period
from
april
until
may
about
may
the
21st.
subsequent
to
that
time
or
prior
to
that
time,
however,
i
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
what
gaston
county
did
in
order
to
give
every
citizen
the
right
to
register,
to
vote,
and
participate
in
the
election
process.
but
first
of
all
the
county
increased
a
number
of
voting
precincts
from
35
to
44
precincts.
that
of
course
was
to
make
it
more
convenient
for
our
people
to
register
and
at
the
same
time
more
convenient
for
him
to
be
able
to
vote
after
they
had
registered.
under
this
new
system
of
registration,
the
election
books
are
kept
open
everyday
of
the
year
from
monday
8:30
a.m.
until
friday
5
o'clock
each
day
and
that
has
been
done
since
1962.
the
record
and
it
was
stipulated
and
agreed
that
all
of
our
registration
process
would
relate
back
to
that
period
of
time
1962.
it
was
a
little
less
than
to
5-year
period,
referred
to
in
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
so
we,
an
effort
to
make
sure
that
the
people
knew
about
this,
the
county
spent
thousands
of
dollars
and
that
is
also
in
the
record.
we
conducted
schools.
the
chairman
of
the
county
of
board
of
elections
conducted
schools
for
the
registrars.
many
of
the
registrars
who
have
served
in
the
past
were
reappointed
and
of
course
we
had
new
registrars
because
of
the
increase
in
the
number
of
voting
precincts.
well
all
of
these
registrars
attended
these
schools
for
the
purpose
of
instructing
them
under
this
new
system
of
registration
and
also
to
give
them
what
we
understood
the
law
to
be,
the
law
of
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
the
test
that
we
thought
at
that
time
would
be
used
and
was
used
and
of
course
until
1964,
the
all
type
of
tests
was
used.
after
the
1964
civil
rights
act,
we
changed
that
test
to
a
written
test
and
we
contend
that
all
of
this
has
been
in
conformity
of
course
with
lassiter
versus
northampton
county.
that
case
has
been
kicked
around
by
the
attorney
general
and
by
us
of
course
in
our
brief
as
to
what
effect
there,
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
has
on
the
decision
in
lassiter
versus
north
hampton
county.
now,
we
contend
that
that
we
followed
the
test
that
was
stated
by
this
court
was
one
that
was
not
on
its
face
discriminatory
and
we
say
that
even
with
the
civil
--
the
voting
rights
act
now
of
1965
that
there
has
been
no
change
because
the
test
we
used
in
this
county
which
was
a
simple
that
is
1964,
a
simple
test.
we
took
what
we
consider
to
be
the
simplest
three
senators
from
the
north
carolina
constitution
and
we
then
would
give
this
to
a
registrar
or
a
person
who
had
applied
to
registration
and
as
was
testified
by
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
elections
after
this
test
was
adopted
in
1964
that
a
person
was
not
required
to
copy
every
word
of
that
test
or
every
word
of
either
of
the
one
of
the
three
sentences
from
the
constitution
that
he
may
select
but
a
reasonable
fact
simply
thereof.
so
that
was
the
--
now,
even
in
1964,
i
would
like
to
remind
the
court
that
again,
before
this
1964
election,
now
the
general
election
of
1964,
we
have
again
the
registrar's
school
in
ways
of
conducting
these
tests
because
we
were
using
a
different
test
after
1964
in
order
to
conform
with
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
so
then
we
also
read
many
newspaper
advertisements
at
the
cost
of
the
county
of
many
thousands
of
dollars.
we
had
radio
spot
announcements.
now
we
had
--
we
did
everything
that
we
thought
reasonable
and
that
reasonable
people
could
do
to
notify
the
citizens
of
gaston
county
that
they,
that
we
were
having
a
new
registration
and
that
we
wanted
as
many
as
possible
to
come
and
register
without
regard
for
race,
creed,
or
color.
now
--
now,
we
say
--
mr.
grady
b.
scott
with
the
purpose
is
to
comply
with
the
--
mr.
grady
b.
scott
the
purpose
your
honor
is
to
comply
with
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
to
comply
with
section
163-3,
i
don't
recall
the
exact
section
but
pertaining
to
voting
in
gaston
county.
that's
exactly
why
we
are
using
--
mr.
grady
b.
scott
we
feel
that
we
do
and
we
contend
that
that's
what
we
were
doing
and
in
order
to
comply
with
our
constitution
and
in
order
for
our
county
officials
to
do
so,
we
selected
what
we
contended
to
be
the
most
simple
type
of
thing
that
we
could
possibly
select
in
order
to
comply
with
that
law.
now,
i
wanted
to
--
mr.
grady
b.
scott
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
i
--
we
admit
that
that
is
a
test
or
device
as
defined
in
the
section
of
the
1965
act.
we
did.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
well,
it
leaves
us
--
we
contend
that
we
have
not
used
it
for
the
purpose
or
with
the
effect
of
discriminating
against
any
person
because
of
race
or
color.
and
we
contend
as
judge
gasch
said
in
his
opinion,
that
no
way
in
this
record
that
he
find
any
evidence
that
would
justify
the
finding
of
the
majority
that
simply
because
we
had
had
a
segregated
system
of
education
in
north
carolina.
and
this
is
a
whole
basis
as
i
read
the
opinion
of
judges
wright
and
robinson.
that
simply
because
north
carolina
had
in
the
past,
had
a
dual
system
of
education
that
that
in
itself
had
the
effect
or
would
fall
within
the
provision
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965,
the
words
with
the
effect
of
denying
or
abridging
the
right
of
a
person
to
vote.
now,
we
contend
and
as
set
forth
in
our
brief
that
we
the
congress
never
meant
any
such
thing
as
that
because
if
the
time
was
adopted
they
were
aware
of
this
dual
system
state.
they
were
aware
that
this
had
been
going
on
in
many
states
other
than
the
ones
that
this
act
was
designed
or
projected
toward
--
mr.
grady
b.
scott
i
didn't
hear
you
your
honor.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
it
would
have
been
--
it
would
be
a
test
or
device
within
the
act
but
had
that
been
true
at
the
time
that
congress
enacted
this
legislation,
then
i
say
that
congress
would
have
said
because
you
have
practice
a
segregation
in
the
schools
or
have
had
a
dual
system
of
education
or
that
you
have
denied
your
people,
the
negro
people
--
mr.
grady
b.
scott
it
would
have
the
effect
--
mr.
grady
b.
scott
if
we
use
this
simple
test.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
well,
i
say
again
and
the
only
answer
that
i
can
give
to
his
honor
is
that
that
was
not
true
in
the
first
place
in
north
carolina
but
if
that
had
been
true,
the
congress
would
have
said
in
a
state
where
the
negroes
have
been
denied
the
right
to
attend
school
at
all.
give
this
test,
you
shall
not
period
give
any
test
or
use
a
test
or
device
of
any
kind.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
that
--
that's
exactly
the
basis
of
their
decision.
but
--
mr.
grady
b.
scott
i
challenge
that
part
strongly.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
i
--
mr.
grady
b.
scott
i
challenge
it
strongly
and
i
say
that
the
evidence
in
the
case
showed
--
mr.
grady
b.
scott
that
even
i
were
so
mr.
justice
white,
i
--
mr.
grady
b.
scott
i
still
say
that
we
deserve
to
win
the
case
because
--
mr.
grady
b.
scott
under
the
law.
now,
i
will
--
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
evidence
in
the
case
showed
that
52%
of
the
negroes
of
voting
age
in
gaston
county
have
registered.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
63%
of
the
white
had.
now,
there's
a
discrepancy
of
approximately
11.1%.
now,
i
pointed
out
and
it
said
out
in
the
brief
that
in
this
case
of
united
states
against
texas,
and
that
was
which
was
affirmed
by
this
court.
and
that
was
a
vote,
that
was
a
poll
tax
case
but
in
that
case,
the
government
and
in
everyone
of
these
cases,
they
have
adopted
this
same
approach
that
because
of
the
segregated
facility,
united
states
against
mississippi
and
united
states
against
texas
that
because
they
were
segregated
facilities
that
that
in
itself
has
the
effect
or
is
discriminatory
because
of
a
segregated
or
a
dual
school
system.
now
in
the
case
of
united
states
against
texas,
where
the
government
had
this
same
type
of
evidence
and
judge
thornberry,
i
believe
his
name
was,
stated
that
he
could
not
take
that
evidence
where
there
was
only
a
discrepancy
of
approximately
12%
between
those
who
--
the
whites
who
paid
the
poll
tax
and
the
negro
who
paid
the
poll
tax
and
if
that
was
not
sufficient
in
his
opinion
as
a
discrepancy
to
justify
saying
that
the
segregated
school
system
was
a
reason
for
or
was
sufficient
to
justify
that
they
should
have
to
pay
a
poll
tax
or
not
pay
a
poll
tax.
now,
i
contend
that
in
our
situation
in
gaston
county
that
we
have
a
discrepancy
of
11
some
--
11.1%
and
that
in
itself
is
certainly
not
evidence
of
use
of
a
test
or
device
for
the
purpose
of
denying
or
abridging
the
right
of
the
person
to
register
and
vote.
now,
one
other
thing
i
wanted
to
--
i'd
like
to
mention
to
you
in
that
regard.
we
--
we
brought
with
us
a
negro
schoolman
who
had
been
in
the
public
schools
of
gaston
county
since
1932.
we
--
he
testified
before
this
court
and
he
was
asked
whether
he
had
an
opinion
as
to
whether
or
not
the
schools
since
1932
had
sufficient
facilities
and
were
equipped
to
teach
a
child
or
a
person
to
read
and
write
well
enough
to
pass
this
simple
test
that
is
in
this
record.
well,
he
said
and
his
answer
was
that
all
of
our
schools
i
think,
all
of
them
would
be
able
to
teach
any
negro
child
to
read
and
to
write
so
that
he
could
read
a
newspaper,
so
that
he
could
read
any
simple
material
that
didn't
have
any
foreign
words
or
extractions.
this
has
always
been
true
and
i
don't
think
there
was
any,
there
was
an
argument
anywhere
except
that
that
maybe
the
facilities
were
different.
but
they
have
been
basically
able
to
teach
this
and
this
is
what
they
have
done.
now
the
amazing
thing
to
me
was
that
the
majority
of
the
court
below
said
this
testimony
is
unpersuasive
to
me.
and
just,
you
might
say
completely
ignore
that
testimony.
well,
it
was
rebutted
and
under
the
case
of
south
carolina
against
katzenbach,
it
says
that
all
the
unit
needs
to
do
is
to
submit
affidavits
and
voting
officials
and
then
to
refute
whatever
evidence
the
government
may
offer
to
the
contrary.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
what
would
have
happen
to
him?
mr.
grady
b.
scott
they
wouldn't
have
anything
happen
to
him
if
come
in
--
mr.
grady
b.
scott
absolutely.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
i
say
absolutely
not
in
gaston
county,
if
it
please
your
honor.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
yes,
this
--
he
could
be
dismissed
but
i'm
saying
that
in
gaston
county
that
we
don't
operate
in
that
manner
if
it
please
your
honor.
we
just
--
i'm
saying
that
this
man
--
mr.
grady
b.
scott
is
he
a
principal
of
a
college
school?
mr.
grady
b.
scott
of
a
negro
colored
school.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
yes.
but
now
--
of
course
we
have
had
a
consolidation
of
our
schools
and
since
this
time
and
since
the
trial
of
this
case.
but
i'm
saying
that
if
he
had
testified
truthfully
in
which
i
am
satisfied
in
my
mind
he
did
that
certainly
--
mr.
grady
b.
scott
that
certainly
his
testimony
should
have
been
given
some
weight.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
have
i
ever
been
in
this
school?
yes.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
i
have
been
in
the
school
that
he
was
a
principal
of.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
yes,
i
have.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
one
of
the
finest
schools
we
have
in
the
county.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
yes,
a
new
facility,
it
was
probably
7,
8,
10
years
old.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
what
school
would
be
second
to
it
now?
mr.
grady
b.
scott
well,
that
is
not
any
longer
a
high
school.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
that
--
that
school
is
not
any
longer
a
high
school.
it
is
now
an
elementary
or
grammar
school,
one
of
the
two,
i'm
not
sure
because
the
schools
that
he
was
principal
of
was
merged
with
the
white
school
and
called
the
national
high
school
and
now
these
schools
are
merged.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
but
this
i
contend
that
this
testimony
should
have
been
persuasive
because
it
was
unrebutted.
we
had
other
witnesses
who
testified
and
certainly
there
was
no
threat
from
anybody
that
had
he
not
testified
in
this
regard
so
it
would
have
happen
to
it
because
after
all
i
think
the
evidence
itself
shows
that
here
we
got
52%
of
the
negroes
eligible
to
register
that
actually
register.
that
certainly
should
be
some
evidence
that
we
in
gaston
county
are
not
the
kind
of
people
who
would
come
and
make
a
threat
to
a
person
to
make
him
testify
to
anything
and
because
we
contend
that
this
evidence
in
this
record
shows
in
the
statistics
himself
show
that
we
had
not
used
the
test
or
device
for
the
purpose
of
discrimination.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
1932.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
yes.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
i
don't
recall
the
exact
percentage
but
approximately
25
to
30%
maybe.
but
that
was
a
testimony
that
he
did
come
to
the
system
in
1932.
but
this
was
--
this
was
testimony
that
we
felt
was
unrebutted.
judge
gasch
in
his
opinion
said
that
he
felt
that
the
majority
had
just
completely
ignored
this
testimony
and
it
should
have
been
given
weight
which
he
felt
was
not.
of
course,
we
also
felt
that
it
should
have
been
given
considerable
weight.
in
view
of
south
carolina
versus
katzenbach
as
to
what
we
were
required
to
prove
or
and
refute
on
the
part
of
the
government.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
well,
we
feel
that
in
that
connection
that
the
attorney
general
under
the
act
was
required
to
make
a
certification
to
the
municipality
within
the
county.
we
say
that
the
act
itself
and
when
you
refer
to
the
definition
of
a
political
subdivision
as
set
out
in
section
14
(c)
(2)
of
the
1965
voting
rights
act
that
the
attorney
general
was
required
under
the
act
to
certify
to
that
unit
because
the
county
itself
had
no
control
over
the
municipal
elections
in
that
--
in
our
county
by
virtue
of
state
law.
we
have
11
municipalities
i
believe
as
the
record
would
show
and
we
say
that
since
we
have
no
control
over
these
elections,
none
whatever,
now
we
couldn't
say
to
the
registrar
by
virtue
of
state
law
here
why
you
don't
do
this
or
this
is
a
type
of
test
you
shall
or
you
shall
not
give.
the
law
gave
under
in
our
state
the
right
to
hold
the
municipal
elections
to
the
municipality
itself.
and
i
want
to
mention
at
this
point
that
the
attorney
general
entered
into
a
consent
judgment
with
white
county
which
is
a
county
right
here,
right
in
our
own
state.
using
the
same
type
of
test,
or
similar
type
test
that
we
used
in
gaston
county
and
they
say
and
enter
into
consent
judgment
with
no
--
that
uses
has
the
same
type
of
school
system
that
we
have
had
in
the
whole
state
a
segregated
type
system.
so
yet
they
say
the
white
county,
the
fact
that
you
had
a
segregated
school
system
doesn't
affect
you
but
now
gaston
county
it
does.
we
say
that
that
in
itself
prevents
gaston
county
or
anybody
else
with
the
segregated
or
the
bureau
of
system
of
education
or
in
the
past
of
having
that
type
thing
of
ever
coming
out
from
under
this
act
and
we
contend
if
it
please
the
court
that
certainly,
the
five
years
mentioned
in
the
act
has
some
--
mean
something.
they
said
relate
back
for
five
years
and
of
course
the
government
is
going
back
in
here
to
1900
and
brought
in
newspaper
headlines
from
the
raleigh
news
observer
now
put
in
evidence
at
which
we
have
no
way
to
refute
what
the
newspaper
said
in
1900
and
that
type
of
thing
which
is
a
part
of
the
evidence
that
we
do
adhere
to
you
that
certainly
the
fact
that
there
was
a
segregated
system,
we
should
not
have
any
bearing
on
this
decision
and
that
the
congress
didn't
mean
that
it
would
and
that
that
in
itself
would
do
something.
mainly,
on
the
question
then
of
the
last
point
in
the
point
of
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
me
about
as
to
the
municipality
and
the
part
that
judge
gasch
ruled
or
in
the
form
that
he
ruled.
we
say
and
that
your
honor
that
if
we
had
had
control
of
these
elections
then
it
would
have
been
our
responsibility
of
course
to
have
refuted
evidence
adduce
by
the
government
in
regard
to
municipal
elections
but
we
have
no
such
authority.
the
searching
--
mr.
grady
b.
scott
i
--
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
it's
not
very
much
on
that
point
in
courses
of
great
deal
on
the
first
point
about
the
segregated
systems
or
unequal
educational
systems.
it's
very
little
in
the
brief
of
the
united
states
they
argue
that
it
has
--
that
the
word
“in”
and
it
had
a
territorial
effect.
but
the
term
political
subdivision
as
defined
in
the
act,
it
says
the
term
political
subdivision
shall
mean
any
court
or
parish
except
--
i
read,
i
said
court,
this
term
political
subdivision
shall
mean
any
county
or
parish
except
that
where
registration
for
voting
is
not
conducted
under
the
supervision
of
a
county
or
parish,
the
term
shall
include
any
other
subdivision
of
a
state
which
conducts
registration
for
voting.
but
i
contend
that
there
they
had
in
mind
that
where
you
didn't
have
control
over
it,
then
of
course
you
would
have
to
be
certified
by
under
the
section
4
(b)
of
the
act,
the
coverage
formula
before
you
would
be
required
to
spend
the
test.
now,
we
contend
for
that
reason
that
we
did
not
and
we're
not
required
to
present
evidence
in
regard
to
the
municipal
elections
over
which
we
have
no
control.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
well,
the
burden
of
proof
under
the
act
and
quoting
again
from
the
katzenbach
--
south
carolina
versus
katzenbach
that
the
--
that
all
that
a
political
unit
or
subdivision
needs
to
do
is
to
give
affidavits
and
other
type
of
information
from
voting
officials
asserting
that
there
has
been
no
such
discrimination
or
use
of
the
test
for
the
purpose
of
discriminating.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say,
and
then
the
plaintiff
in
the
action
or
the
petitioner
must
refute
whatever
evidence
to
the
contrary
the
government
may
adduce.
well,
so
then
that
throws
the
burden
back
to
the
plaintiff
of
going
forward.
i
would
say
that
to
show
that
there
has
been
no
use
of
a
test
or
device
for
the
purpose
of
denying
or
abridging
the
right
of
a
person
to
vote
on
account
of
creed,
race,
or
color.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
all
of
the
municipalities
have
their
own
registrars.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
there
is
none
in
this
record.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
well
--
mr.
grady
b.
scott
--
it
would,
it
would.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
that's
correct
and
the
attorney
general
has
never
made
any
determination
or
investigation
so
far
as
we
know
as
to
whether
municipalities
did
in
any
way
--
mr.
grady
b.
scott
--
to
use
a
test
or
device.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
the
attorney
general
only
notified
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
county
elections.
in
so
far
as
record
shows,
well
that
he
ever
notified
anybody
and
any
person
in
a
municipality
we
don't
know.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
the
record
is
also
silent
on
that
point.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
i
can't
answer
that
your
honor.
i
know
that
just
recently
the
city
of
gastonia,
the
largest
municipality
in
the
county
has
had
a
new
registration.
that
was
it
within
the
last
two
or
three
weeks.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
i
can't
say
that
they
are
using
a
literacy
test.
i
--
i
can't
say
that
they
are
because
i
understand
that
they
were
not
using
one
but
i
cannot
state
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
this
court.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
without
any
evidence
of
you
mean
of
the
--
what
went
on
in
the
municipalities?
well,
there
was
--
mr.
grady
b.
scott
--
there
was
--
mr.
grady
b.
scott
well,
but
it
wasn't
responsibility
of
a
political
subdivision
that
had
no
control
over
to
adduce
evidence
in
that
regard.
and
that's
the
position
we
take
that
there
was
no
certification
and
we
were
not
required
under
the
act
because
it
doesn't
say
so
to
do,
to
furnish
evidence
in
regard
to
the
use
of
test
by
municipalities.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
came
to
this
court
from
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia.
the
case
was
heard
in
the
district
court
here
in
washington
before
judges
wright,
robinson,
and
gasch.
the
opinion
of
these
justices
was
a
two-judge
--
the
two
of
the
judges
wrote
an
opinion
which
we
contend
first
of
all
was
based
on
a
theory
that
was
not
justified
under
the
1965
voting
rights
act.
the
concurring
opinion
of
judge
gasch
was
based
on
a
different
theory,
a
theory
that
because
the
gaston
county
had
failed
to
maybe
offer
evidence
that
we
did
not
discriminate
by
the
use
of
a
test
or
device
in
municipal
elections.
the
record
is
amply
showed
that
the
municipal
elections
of
course
were
not
under
the
control
of
the
county
board
of
elections.
so
just
to
give
a
brief
background,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
it
was
in
march
of
1966
that
we
were
certified
by
the
attorney
general
and
subsequently
at
that
time
was
printed
in
the
federal
registry
and
in
august
of
1966,
we
filed
a
suit
in
the
district
court
and
it
was
heard
here
in
june
21
and
22
of
the
following
year.
these
two
opinions
after
having
been
handed
down,
we
appeal
to
this
court
in
probable
jurisdiction
was
then
noted
on
january
13,
1969.
the
three
main
points
that
we
would
like
to
argue
in
connection
with
this
case
is
first
of
all
that
gaston
county
and
the
record
we
contend
is
replete
without
offset
we
at
no
time
have
used
a
test
or
device
to
discriminate
because
of
race
and
color
or
for
any
other
reasons.
we
set
out
in
the
record.
we
brought
witnesses
here
to
washington
both
the
white
and
negro
race
to
show
to
the
court
that
this
particular
county
in
north
carolina
was
not
one
that
this
act
was
designed
for.
in
reading
the
case,
of
course
of
south
carolina
against
katzenbach
in
which
the
history
of
this
whole
act
or
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
set
forth
in
stating
that
the
repressive
type
of
thing
that
was
going
on
in
some
other
states
in
the
union
to
at
least
try
to
avoid
that
type
of
conduct
continuing.
we
contend
that
gaston
county
does
not
fall
into
that
same
category.
so
we
then
presented
evidence.
we
brought
with
us
these
witnesses
who
testified
orally
the
government
offered
depositions
without
any
oral
testimony.
both
parties
to
the
action
did
offer
depositions.
i
believe
that
the
government
offered
at
29
depositions
plus
some
other
documentary
evidence.
we
offer
depositions
of
about
9
or
11
people
i
believe.
now
we
first
in
the
record,
it
will
indicate
that
in
1962,
a
new
registration
was
adopted
in
gaston
county
and
this
was
a
system
called
a
permanent
loose-leaf
type
registration.
until
that
time,
we
had
had,
well
i
guess
it
may
be
at
1940
was
the
only
other
time
that
anything
it
had
been
done
about
the
registration
books.
but
in
1962,
a
complete
new
registration
was
ordered
called
the
mcmillan
system
and
it
was
by
statute
that
we
adopted
this
system
in
north
carolina.
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
elections
at
that
time,
starting
in
april
and
from
april
until
may
of
1962
conducted
a
registration
so
that
the
voters
would
be
eligible
to
vote
in
the
may
primary
of
1962
that
the
evidence
will
probably
indicate
that
during
that
short
period
of
time,
we
registered
in
our
county
approximately
30
some
thousand
people.
it
was
a
rounded
figure,
i
am
not
exact
about
that
but
approximately
30,000
people
which
we
might
say
was
in
a
period
of
approximately
15
days
and
three
saturdays
within
that
period
from
april
until
may
about
may
the
21st.
subsequent
to
that
time
or
prior
to
that
time,
however,
i
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
what
gaston
county
did
in
order
to
give
every
citizen
the
right
to
register,
to
vote,
and
participate
in
the
election
process.
but
first
of
all
the
county
increased
a
number
of
voting
precincts
from
35
to
44
precincts.
that
of
course
was
to
make
it
more
convenient
for
our
people
to
register
and
at
the
same
time
more
convenient
for
him
to
be
able
to
vote
after
they
had
registered.
under
this
new
system
of
registration,
the
election
books
are
kept
open
everyday
of
the
year
from
monday
8:30
a.m.
until
friday
5
o'clock
each
day
and
that
has
been
done
since
1962.
the
record
and
it
was
stipulated
and
agreed
that
all
of
our
registration
process
would
relate
back
to
that
period
of
time
1962.
it
was
a
little
less
than
to
5-year
period,
referred
to
in
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
so
we,
an
effort
to
make
sure
that
the
people
knew
about
this,
the
county
spent
thousands
of
dollars
and
that
is
also
in
the
record.
we
conducted
schools.
the
chairman
of
the
county
of
board
of
elections
conducted
schools
for
the
registrars.
many
of
the
registrars
who
have
served
in
the
past
were
reappointed
and
of
course
we
had
new
registrars
because
of
the
increase
in
the
number
of
voting
precincts.
well
all
of
these
registrars
attended
these
schools
for
the
purpose
of
instructing
them
under
this
new
system
of
registration
and
also
to
give
them
what
we
understood
the
law
to
be,
the
law
of
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
the
test
that
we
thought
at
that
time
would
be
used
and
was
used
and
of
course
until
1964,
the
all
type
of
tests
was
used.
after
the
1964
civil
rights
act,
we
changed
that
test
to
a
written
test
and
we
contend
that
all
of
this
has
been
in
conformity
of
course
with
lassiter
versus
northampton
county.
that
case
has
been
kicked
around
by
the
attorney
general
and
by
us
of
course
in
our
brief
as
to
what
effect
there,
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
has
on
the
decision
in
lassiter
versus
north
hampton
county.
now,
we
contend
that
that
we
followed
the
test
that
was
stated
by
this
court
was
one
that
was
not
on
its
face
discriminatory
and
we
say
that
even
with
the
civil
--
the
voting
rights
act
now
of
1965
that
there
has
been
no
change
because
the
test
we
used
in
this
county
which
was
a
simple
that
is
1964,
a
simple
test.
we
took
what
we
consider
to
be
the
simplest
three
senators
from
the
north
carolina
constitution
and
we
then
would
give
this
to
a
registrar
or
a
person
who
had
applied
to
registration
and
as
was
testified
by
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
elections
after
this
test
was
adopted
in
1964
that
a
person
was
not
required
to
copy
every
word
of
that
test
or
every
word
of
either
of
the
one
of
the
three
sentences
from
the
constitution
that
he
may
select
but
a
reasonable
fact
simply
thereof.
so
that
was
the
--
now,
even
in
1964,
i
would
like
to
remind
the
court
that
again,
before
this
1964
election,
now
the
general
election
of
1964,
we
have
again
the
registrar's
school
in
ways
of
conducting
these
tests
because
we
were
using
a
different
test
after
1964
in
order
to
conform
with
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
so
then
we
also
read
many
newspaper
advertisements
at
the
cost
of
the
county
of
many
thousands
of
dollars.
we
had
radio
spot
announcements.
now
we
had
--
we
did
everything
that
we
thought
reasonable
and
that
reasonable
people
could
do
to
notify
the
citizens
of
gaston
county
that
they,
that
we
were
having
a
new
registration
and
that
we
wanted
as
many
as
possible
to
come
and
register
without
regard
for
race,
creed,
or
color.
now
--
now,
we
say
--
mr.
grady
b.
scott
with
the
purpose
is
to
comply
with
the
--
mr.
grady
b.
scott
the
purpose
your
honor
is
to
comply
with
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
to
comply
with
section
163-3,
i
don't
recall
the
exact
section
but
pertaining
to
voting
in
gaston
county.
that's
exactly
why
we
are
using
--
mr.
grady
b.
scott
we
feel
that
we
do
and
we
contend
that
that's
what
we
were
doing
and
in
order
to
comply
with
our
constitution
and
in
order
for
our
county
officials
to
do
so,
we
selected
what
we
contended
to
be
the
most
simple
type
of
thing
that
we
could
possibly
select
in
order
to
comply
with
that
law.
now,
i
wanted
to
--
mr.
grady
b.
scott
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
i
--
we
admit
that
that
is
a
test
or
device
as
defined
in
the
section
of
the
1965
act.
we
did.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
well,
it
leaves
us
--
we
contend
that
we
have
not
used
it
for
the
purpose
or
with
the
effect
of
discriminating
against
any
person
because
of
race
or
color.
and
we
contend
as
judge
gasch
said
in
his
opinion,
that
no
way
in
this
record
that
he
find
any
evidence
that
would
justify
the
finding
of
the
majority
that
simply
because
we
had
had
a
segregated
system
of
education
in
north
carolina.
and
this
is
a
whole
basis
as
i
read
the
opinion
of
judges
wright
and
robinson.
that
simply
because
north
carolina
had
in
the
past,
had
a
dual
system
of
education
that
that
in
itself
had
the
effect
or
would
fall
within
the
provision
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965,
the
words
with
the
effect
of
denying
or
abridging
the
right
of
a
person
to
vote.
now,
we
contend
and
as
set
forth
in
our
brief
that
we
the
congress
never
meant
any
such
thing
as
that
because
if
the
time
was
adopted
they
were
aware
of
this
dual
system
state.
they
were
aware
that
this
had
been
going
on
in
many
states
other
than
the
ones
that
this
act
was
designed
or
projected
toward
--
mr.
grady
b.
scott
i
didn't
hear
you
your
honor.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
it
would
have
been
--
it
would
be
a
test
or
device
within
the
act
but
had
that
been
true
at
the
time
that
congress
enacted
this
legislation,
then
i
say
that
congress
would
have
said
because
you
have
practice
a
segregation
in
the
schools
or
have
had
a
dual
system
of
education
or
that
you
have
denied
your
people,
the
negro
people
--
mr.
grady
b.
scott
it
would
have
the
effect
--
mr.
grady
b.
scott
if
we
use
this
simple
test.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
well,
i
say
again
and
the
only
answer
that
i
can
give
to
his
honor
is
that
that
was
not
true
in
the
first
place
in
north
carolina
but
if
that
had
been
true,
the
congress
would
have
said
in
a
state
where
the
negroes
have
been
denied
the
right
to
attend
school
at
all.
give
this
test,
you
shall
not
period
give
any
test
or
use
a
test
or
device
of
any
kind.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
that
--
that's
exactly
the
basis
of
their
decision.
but
--
mr.
grady
b.
scott
i
challenge
that
part
strongly.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
i
--
mr.
grady
b.
scott
i
challenge
it
strongly
and
i
say
that
the
evidence
in
the
case
showed
--
mr.
grady
b.
scott
that
even
i
were
so
mr.
justice
white,
i
--
mr.
grady
b.
scott
i
still
say
that
we
deserve
to
win
the
case
because
--
mr.
grady
b.
scott
under
the
law.
now,
i
will
--
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
evidence
in
the
case
showed
that
52%
of
the
negroes
of
voting
age
in
gaston
county
have
registered.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
63%
of
the
white
had.
now,
there's
a
discrepancy
of
approximately
11.1%.
now,
i
pointed
out
and
it
said
out
in
the
brief
that
in
this
case
of
united
states
against
texas,
and
that
was
which
was
affirmed
by
this
court.
and
that
was
a
vote,
that
was
a
poll
tax
case
but
in
that
case,
the
government
and
in
everyone
of
these
cases,
they
have
adopted
this
same
approach
that
because
of
the
segregated
facility,
united
states
against
mississippi
and
united
states
against
texas
that
because
they
were
segregated
facilities
that
that
in
itself
has
the
effect
or
is
discriminatory
because
of
a
segregated
or
a
dual
school
system.
now
in
the
case
of
united
states
against
texas,
where
the
government
had
this
same
type
of
evidence
and
judge
thornberry,
i
believe
his
name
was,
stated
that
he
could
not
take
that
evidence
where
there
was
only
a
discrepancy
of
approximately
12%
between
those
who
--
the
whites
who
paid
the
poll
tax
and
the
negro
who
paid
the
poll
tax
and
if
that
was
not
sufficient
in
his
opinion
as
a
discrepancy
to
justify
saying
that
the
segregated
school
system
was
a
reason
for
or
was
sufficient
to
justify
that
they
should
have
to
pay
a
poll
tax
or
not
pay
a
poll
tax.
now,
i
contend
that
in
our
situation
in
gaston
county
that
we
have
a
discrepancy
of
11
some
--
11.1%
and
that
in
itself
is
certainly
not
evidence
of
use
of
a
test
or
device
for
the
purpose
of
denying
or
abridging
the
right
of
the
person
to
register
and
vote.
now,
one
other
thing
i
wanted
to
--
i'd
like
to
mention
to
you
in
that
regard.
we
--
we
brought
with
us
a
negro
schoolman
who
had
been
in
the
public
schools
of
gaston
county
since
1932.
we
--
he
testified
before
this
court
and
he
was
asked
whether
he
had
an
opinion
as
to
whether
or
not
the
schools
since
1932
had
sufficient
facilities
and
were
equipped
to
teach
a
child
or
a
person
to
read
and
write
well
enough
to
pass
this
simple
test
that
is
in
this
record.
well,
he
said
and
his
answer
was
that
all
of
our
schools
i
think,
all
of
them
would
be
able
to
teach
any
negro
child
to
read
and
to
write
so
that
he
could
read
a
newspaper,
so
that
he
could
read
any
simple
material
that
didn't
have
any
foreign
words
or
extractions.
this
has
always
been
true
and
i
don't
think
there
was
any,
there
was
an
argument
anywhere
except
that
that
maybe
the
facilities
were
different.
but
they
have
been
basically
able
to
teach
this
and
this
is
what
they
have
done.
now
the
amazing
thing
to
me
was
that
the
majority
of
the
court
below
said
this
testimony
is
unpersuasive
to
me.
and
just,
you
might
say
completely
ignore
that
testimony.
well,
it
was
rebutted
and
under
the
case
of
south
carolina
against
katzenbach,
it
says
that
all
the
unit
needs
to
do
is
to
submit
affidavits
and
voting
officials
and
then
to
refute
whatever
evidence
the
government
may
offer
to
the
contrary.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
what
would
have
happen
to
him?
mr.
grady
b.
scott
they
wouldn't
have
anything
happen
to
him
if
come
in
--
mr.
grady
b.
scott
absolutely.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
i
say
absolutely
not
in
gaston
county,
if
it
please
your
honor.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
yes,
this
--
he
could
be
dismissed
but
i'm
saying
that
in
gaston
county
that
we
don't
operate
in
that
manner
if
it
please
your
honor.
we
just
--
i'm
saying
that
this
man
--
mr.
grady
b.
scott
is
he
a
principal
of
a
college
school?
mr.
grady
b.
scott
of
a
negro
colored
school.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
yes.
but
now
--
of
course
we
have
had
a
consolidation
of
our
schools
and
since
this
time
and
since
the
trial
of
this
case.
but
i'm
saying
that
if
he
had
testified
truthfully
in
which
i
am
satisfied
in
my
mind
he
did
that
certainly
--
mr.
grady
b.
scott
that
certainly
his
testimony
should
have
been
given
some
weight.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
have
i
ever
been
in
this
school?
yes.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
i
have
been
in
the
school
that
he
was
a
principal
of.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
yes,
i
have.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
one
of
the
finest
schools
we
have
in
the
county.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
yes,
a
new
facility,
it
was
probably
7,
8,
10
years
old.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
what
school
would
be
second
to
it
now?
mr.
grady
b.
scott
well,
that
is
not
any
longer
a
high
school.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
that
--
that
school
is
not
any
longer
a
high
school.
it
is
now
an
elementary
or
grammar
school,
one
of
the
two,
i'm
not
sure
because
the
schools
that
he
was
principal
of
was
merged
with
the
white
school
and
called
the
national
high
school
and
now
these
schools
are
merged.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
but
this
i
contend
that
this
testimony
should
have
been
persuasive
because
it
was
unrebutted.
we
had
other
witnesses
who
testified
and
certainly
there
was
no
threat
from
anybody
that
had
he
not
testified
in
this
regard
so
it
would
have
happen
to
it
because
after
all
i
think
the
evidence
itself
shows
that
here
we
got
52%
of
the
negroes
eligible
to
register
that
actually
register.
that
certainly
should
be
some
evidence
that
we
in
gaston
county
are
not
the
kind
of
people
who
would
come
and
make
a
threat
to
a
person
to
make
him
testify
to
anything
and
because
we
contend
that
this
evidence
in
this
record
shows
in
the
statistics
himself
show
that
we
had
not
used
the
test
or
device
for
the
purpose
of
discrimination.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
1932.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
yes.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
i
don't
recall
the
exact
percentage
but
approximately
25
to
30%
maybe.
but
that
was
a
testimony
that
he
did
come
to
the
system
in
1932.
but
this
was
--
this
was
testimony
that
we
felt
was
unrebutted.
judge
gasch
in
his
opinion
said
that
he
felt
that
the
majority
had
just
completely
ignored
this
testimony
and
it
should
have
been
given
weight
which
he
felt
was
not.
of
course,
we
also
felt
that
it
should
have
been
given
considerable
weight.
in
view
of
south
carolina
versus
katzenbach
as
to
what
we
were
required
to
prove
or
and
refute
on
the
part
of
the
government.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
well,
we
feel
that
in
that
connection
that
the
attorney
general
under
the
act
was
required
to
make
a
certification
to
the
municipality
within
the
county.
we
say
that
the
act
itself
and
when
you
refer
to
the
definition
of
a
political
subdivision
as
set
out
in
section
14
(c)
(2)
of
the
1965
voting
rights
act
that
the
attorney
general
was
required
under
the
act
to
certify
to
that
unit
because
the
county
itself
had
no
control
over
the
municipal
elections
in
that
--
in
our
county
by
virtue
of
state
law.
we
have
11
municipalities
i
believe
as
the
record
would
show
and
we
say
that
since
we
have
no
control
over
these
elections,
none
whatever,
now
we
couldn't
say
to
the
registrar
by
virtue
of
state
law
here
why
you
don't
do
this
or
this
is
a
type
of
test
you
shall
or
you
shall
not
give.
the
law
gave
under
in
our
state
the
right
to
hold
the
municipal
elections
to
the
municipality
itself.
and
i
want
to
mention
at
this
point
that
the
attorney
general
entered
into
a
consent
judgment
with
white
county
which
is
a
county
right
here,
right
in
our
own
state.
using
the
same
type
of
test,
or
similar
type
test
that
we
used
in
gaston
county
and
they
say
and
enter
into
consent
judgment
with
no
--
that
uses
has
the
same
type
of
school
system
that
we
have
had
in
the
whole
state
a
segregated
type
system.
so
yet
they
say
the
white
county,
the
fact
that
you
had
a
segregated
school
system
doesn't
affect
you
but
now
gaston
county
it
does.
we
say
that
that
in
itself
prevents
gaston
county
or
anybody
else
with
the
segregated
or
the
bureau
of
system
of
education
or
in
the
past
of
having
that
type
thing
of
ever
coming
out
from
under
this
act
and
we
contend
if
it
please
the
court
that
certainly,
the
five
years
mentioned
in
the
act
has
some
--
mean
something.
they
said
relate
back
for
five
years
and
of
course
the
government
is
going
back
in
here
to
1900
and
brought
in
newspaper
headlines
from
the
raleigh
news
observer
now
put
in
evidence
at
which
we
have
no
way
to
refute
what
the
newspaper
said
in
1900
and
that
type
of
thing
which
is
a
part
of
the
evidence
that
we
do
adhere
to
you
that
certainly
the
fact
that
there
was
a
segregated
system,
we
should
not
have
any
bearing
on
this
decision
and
that
the
congress
didn't
mean
that
it
would
and
that
that
in
itself
would
do
something.
mainly,
on
the
question
then
of
the
last
point
in
the
point
of
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
me
about
as
to
the
municipality
and
the
part
that
judge
gasch
ruled
or
in
the
form
that
he
ruled.
we
say
and
that
your
honor
that
if
we
had
had
control
of
these
elections
then
it
would
have
been
our
responsibility
of
course
to
have
refuted
evidence
adduce
by
the
government
in
regard
to
municipal
elections
but
we
have
no
such
authority.
the
searching
--
mr.
grady
b.
scott
i
--
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
it's
not
very
much
on
that
point
in
courses
of
great
deal
on
the
first
point
about
the
segregated
systems
or
unequal
educational
systems.
it's
very
little
in
the
brief
of
the
united
states
they
argue
that
it
has
--
that
the
word
“in”
and
it
had
a
territorial
effect.
but
the
term
political
subdivision
as
defined
in
the
act,
it
says
the
term
political
subdivision
shall
mean
any
court
or
parish
except
--
i
read,
i
said
court,
this
term
political
subdivision
shall
mean
any
county
or
parish
except
that
where
registration
for
voting
is
not
conducted
under
the
supervision
of
a
county
or
parish,
the
term
shall
include
any
other
subdivision
of
a
state
which
conducts
registration
for
voting.
but
i
contend
that
there
they
had
in
mind
that
where
you
didn't
have
control
over
it,
then
of
course
you
would
have
to
be
certified
by
under
the
section
4
(b)
of
the
act,
the
coverage
formula
before
you
would
be
required
to
spend
the
test.
now,
we
contend
for
that
reason
that
we
did
not
and
we're
not
required
to
present
evidence
in
regard
to
the
municipal
elections
over
which
we
have
no
control.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
well,
the
burden
of
proof
under
the
act
and
quoting
again
from
the
katzenbach
--
south
carolina
versus
katzenbach
that
the
--
that
all
that
a
political
unit
or
subdivision
needs
to
do
is
to
give
affidavits
and
other
type
of
information
from
voting
officials
asserting
that
there
has
been
no
such
discrimination
or
use
of
the
test
for
the
purpose
of
discriminating.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say,
and
then
the
plaintiff
in
the
action
or
the
petitioner
must
refute
whatever
evidence
to
the
contrary
the
government
may
adduce.
well,
so
then
that
throws
the
burden
back
to
the
plaintiff
of
going
forward.
i
would
say
that
to
show
that
there
has
been
no
use
of
a
test
or
device
for
the
purpose
of
denying
or
abridging
the
right
of
a
person
to
vote
on
account
of
creed,
race,
or
color.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
all
of
the
municipalities
have
their
own
registrars.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
there
is
none
in
this
record.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
well
--
mr.
grady
b.
scott
--
it
would,
it
would.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
that's
correct
and
the
attorney
general
has
never
made
any
determination
or
investigation
so
far
as
we
know
as
to
whether
municipalities
did
in
any
way
--
mr.
grady
b.
scott
--
to
use
a
test
or
device.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
the
attorney
general
only
notified
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
county
elections.
in
so
far
as
record
shows,
well
that
he
ever
notified
anybody
and
any
person
in
a
municipality
we
don't
know.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
the
record
is
also
silent
on
that
point.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
i
can't
answer
that
your
honor.
i
know
that
just
recently
the
city
of
gastonia,
the
largest
municipality
in
the
county
has
had
a
new
registration.
that
was
it
within
the
last
two
or
three
weeks.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
i
can't
say
that
they
are
using
a
literacy
test.
i
--
i
can't
say
that
they
are
because
i
understand
that
they
were
not
using
one
but
i
cannot
state
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
this
court.
mr.
grady
b.
scott
without
any
evidence
of
you
mean
of
the
--
what
went
on
in
the
municipalities?
well,
there
was
--
mr.
grady
b.
scott
--
there
was
--
mr.
grady
b.
scott
well,
but
it
wasn't
responsibility
of
a
political
subdivision
that
had
no
control
over
to
adduce
evidence
in
that
regard.
and
that's
the
position
we
take
that
there
was
no
certification
and
we
were
not
required
under
the
act
because
it
doesn't
say
so
to
do,
to
furnish
evidence
in
regard
to
the
use
of
test
by
municipalities.
