mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
justice
black
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
which
reversed
the
alabama
court
of
appeals
which
in
turn
had
reversed
the
circuit
court
of
jefferson
county
which
had
convicted
this
petitioner
for
violating
a
birmingham
ordinance
requiring
a
permit
before
a
procession
or
a
parade
may
be
held.
the
petitioner,
fred
shuttlesworth,
was
sentenced
to
90
days
in
jail
plus
48
days
in
lieu
of
paying
a
fine
and
cost
for
parading
in
violation
of
this
ordinance
which
appears
on
page
4
of
our
brief.
mr.
jack
greenberg
this
was
in
1963.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
case
was
tried
in
the
recorder's
court
in
may
1963
in
the
circuit
court
in
october
1963.
an
appeal
was
promptly
taken
to
the
alabama
court
of
appeals
which
did
not
decide
the
case
until
1965.
the
state
of
alabama
then
took
it
to
the
alabama
supreme
court
which
did
not
decide
the
case
until
november
1967
and
we
promptly
took
it
here.
the
time
was
essentially
spent
in
a
very
lengthy
consideration
or
the
very
lengthy
time
that
was
consumed
while
the
case
was
pending
before
the
two
alabama
courts.
the
ordinance
in
question
which
appears
on
page
4
of
our
brief
states
that,
“it
shall
be
unlawful
to
organize
or
hold
or
assist
in
organizing
and
holding
a
parade
or
procession
or
other
public
demonstration
unless
a
permit
has
been
secured.”
and
then
it
sets
forth
standards
according
to
which
the
permit
may
be
granted
or
denied.
and
those
standards
include
beginning
on
the
very
last
line
on
page
4
of
our
brief,
public
welfare,
peace,
safety,
health,
decency,
good
order,
morals,
or
convenience.
as
i
stated,
this
arose
in
1963
and
this
is
what
one
might
call
a
prototype
case.
this
is
the
case
of
the
one
petitioner
whose
conviction
has
been
appealed
and
there
area
approximately
1500
other
cases
pending
in
the
juvenile
court
and
the
circuit
court
of
jefferson
county
awaiting
disposition
of
this
case.
the
case
arose
at
what
one
may
call
a
classical
type
of
civil
rights
march.
mr.
jack
greenberg
approximately
1500,
about
900
in
the
juvenile
court
and
600
in
the
circuit
court
are
being
held
pending
the
outcome
of
this
case.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
other
persons
were
prosecuted
for
violation
of
this
ordinance
during
this
--
these
has
occurred
during
the
series
of
demonstrations
in
birmingham
but
in
1963
which
openly
led
to
the
passage
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act
and
there
were
a
series
of
demonstrations
and
marches
over
a
period
of
some
time.
and
while
there
were
only,
there
were
52
persons
arrested
in
this
particular
demonstration,
there
were
1,500
altogether.
this
--
the
civil
rights
march
was
one
might
call
a
classical
type
of
civil
rights
march.
the
group
of
marchers
of
which
petitioners,
shuttlesworth
with
which
he
was
connected
left
the
church
at
approximately
2:00
or
2:30
in
the
afternoon.
they
walked
in
the
sidewalks.
they
were
entirely
orderly.
there
was
no
question
about
that
at
all.
they
proceeded
approximately
four
or
somewhat
more
than
four
blocks
and
then
they
were
stopped
by
police
officers
who
asked
whether
or
not
they
had
a
permit.
and
when
they
did
not
--
when
they
said
they
did
not
have
a
permit
they
were
arrested.
i
might
state
that
the
respondent's
brief
is
written
in
an
effort
--
were
written
as
if
this
was
some
sort
of
disorderly
conduct
or
breach
of
the
peace
case.
the
fact
is
that
petitioners
were
not
prosecuted
for
anything
of
the
sort.
they
were
prosecuted
for
parading
without
a
permit.
the
opinion
of
judge
johnson
in
the
court
of
appeals
which
has
been
adopted
essentially
by
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
is
expressed
on
the
fact
that
petitioners
who
orderly
--
the
testimony
of
police
officers
is
unequivocal
that
they
were
orderly.
there
was
a
group
of
demonst
--
there
was
a
group
of
onlookers.
there
is
some
dispute
as
to
whether
or
not
the
onlookers
were
disorderly.
they
were
however
a
discrete
group
and
even
the
alleged
disorder
which
came
out
of
the
conduct
of
the
onlookers
occurred
after
the
arrest
and
it
seems
that
i
don't
think
it
can
be
seriously
contended
or
contended
at
all
that
these
petitioners
acted
in
violation
of
any
disorderly
conduct
or
breach
of
the
peace
statute.
indeed,
they
have
not
been
prosecuted
for
that.
now,
judge
katz's
opinion
in
the
alabama
court
of
appeals
which
reversed
the
conviction
of
the
trial
court
is
a
lengthy
opinion
appearing
at
page
88
of
the
record
however,
it
is
summarized
in
his
conclusion
in
a
brief
section
on
page
143.
and
his
position
was
that
the
permit
ordinance
is
unconstitutional
because
it
is
vague
and
includes
such
terms
as
welfare,
decency,
and
good
morals
which
were
not
ascertained
susceptible
of
any
precise
meaning.
relying
upon
judicial
notice
of
records
in
several
alabama
cases,
he
held
that
the
pattern
of
enforcement
that
is
prosecuted
in
these
petitioners
for
walking
down
the
sidewalk
was
discriminatory
in
the
sense
of
yick
wo
against
hopkins.
and
he
also
held
this
third
point
that
there
was
no
need
shown,
no
state
interest
shown
in
enforcing
an
ordinance
of
this
sort
against
persons
who
were
merely
walking
down
the
sidewalk.
the
dissenting
opinion
of
judge
johnson
which
was
adopted
and
without
any
variation
really
by
the
alabama
supreme
court
consisted
essentially
of
reconstruction
of
the
statute
in
the
mode
of
cox
against
new
hampshire.
he
read
the
statute
and
he
said,
here's
the
statute
contains
the
words
“decency
and
morals
and
welfare
and
the
various
other
vague
terms”
he
said
but
i
read
all
those
terms
out
of
the
statutes
so
those
words
are
no
longer
there.
and
now
he
said
i'm
going
to
read
something
into
the
statute.
and
after
having
read
that
out,
he
read
into
the
statute
of
those
traffic
considerations
and
considerations
that
avert
to
convenience
of
the
public
which
is
the
basis
of
cox
decision
and
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
said
that's
right.
we
read
out
the
bad
words
and
read
them
some
good
words
and
therefore
the
conviction
stands.
now,
our
position
in
this
case
in
summary
is
that
under
decisions
of
this
court,
it
uniformly
has
been
held
that
a
permit
ordinance
which
imposes
a
prior
restraint
in
first
amendment
rights
may
be
disobeyed
with
impunity
if
it
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
and
this
court
has
held
that
in
staub
versus
baxley
and
lovell
against
griffin
and
case
after
case
since
then.
there
seems
to
be
--
it
seems
to
be
conceded
that
the
language
and
question
of
just
to
take
three
of
the
terms:
welfare,
decency,
and
morals
are
so
vague
that
they
aren't
unconstitutional.
indeed,
that's
why
they
were
read
out
of
the
statute
by
judge
johnson
and
by
the
alabama
supreme
court.
there
is
the
question
of
the
cox
case.
our
position
of
the
cox
case
and
i
will
come
to
that
in
a
moment.
it
is
that
it
is
distinguishable
and
that
in
event
it
did
not
take
into
account.
it
did
not
discuss
certain
due
process,
considerations
of
fair
notice
which
reveal
our
central
to
this
petition.
mr.
jack
greenberg
cox
(voice
overlap),
i
will
be
speaking
about
against
cox
against
new
hampshire.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh,
no.
no,
providing
that
it
meets
certain
substantive
and
we
might
add
certain
procedural
standards
and
we
say
that
this
statute
as
rewritten
even
if
it
were
constitutional
as
rewritten.
first,
it
cannot
be
applied
to
convict
this
petition
or
who
acted
before
it
was
rewritten
and
secondly,
we
claim
it
is
not
constitutional
in
any
event
because
it
does
not
provide
for
a
speedy
review
and
certain
standards,
record
keeping,
and
so
forth
that
would
be
necessary
useful
upon
review.
secondly,
we
claim
that
five
years
after
the
event,
the
statute
cannot
be
reconstructed
without
filing
motions
of
fair
notice
to
convict
this
petitioner
would
go
in
a
substantive
sense
distinguished
from
the
procedural
sense
such
a
rewritten
statute
that
might
by
constitutional.
now,
under
decisions
of
this
court
as
i
stated
at
the
outset,
a
march
made
without
a
permit
contrary
to
a
regulation
requiring
a
permit
is
constitutional
and
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment
if
the
permit,
ordinance,
or
regulation
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
now,
it's
conceded
that
this
ordinance
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
and
i've
seen
no
arguments
serious
otherwise
made
to
the
contrary.
an
alternative
would
be
if
the
staub
doctrine
and
the
lovell
doctrine
were
not
the
law
of
this
court
that
dissenters
before
they
marched
would
have
to
engage
in
expensive
litigation
as
in,
let
us
say
the
dombrowski
case
or
would
have
to
submit
themselves
to
lengthy
administrative
proceedings
and
there
would
be
chill
upon
free
expression.
a
petitioner
in
case
such
as
this
would
be
in
a
especially
grave
disadvantage
in
an
administrative
proceeding
because
and
in
a
judicial
proceeding
because
the
scope
of
review
on
appeal
in
the
alabama
courts
is
so
circumscribed
that
in
dealing
with
a
vague
statute,
he
would
have
great
difficulty
in
proving
just
what
right
of
his
head
been
denied.
but
this
ordinance
like
the
one
in
the
cox
case
was
construed
in
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
for
the
first
time
apparently
to
make
it
constitutional
and
it
held,
but
was
held
below
the
cox
save
the
ordinance
and
save
the
conviction.
our
position
is
as
i
stated
before
that
even
if
this
were
the
case
it
could
not
save
the
ordinance
in
the
sense
that
it
could
convict
this
petitioner.
we
distinguish
the
cox
case
on
a
variety
of
grounds.
first
of
all,
in
cox,
there
was
a
statute
which
was
essentially
blank
as
to
standard
and
it
is
conceivable
that
one
might
have
read
that
ordinance
and
he
said,
well,
what
is
it
they
mean
and
reasonably
might
apply
the
traffic
considerations.
but
here's
a
statute
which
quite
explicitly
has
other
standards
that
welfare,
decency,
good
order,
and
so
forth
and
one
need
not
be
at
a
loss
to
guess
what
the
state
means.
the
state
means
these
various
vague
general
things
which
one
can't
really
--
about
which
one
really
can't
predict
whether
one
is
entitled
to
march
or
not.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
standards.
it
just
said,
you
needed
a
permit.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
that
was
--
i
think
it
was,
yes.
you
just
said
you
needed
a
permit
but
it
did
not
have
any
standards
in
it.
this
case
on
the
contrary
has
a
series
of
vague
standards
and
its
while,
i
would
not
agree
with
this
but
it
would
be
conceivable
to
say
that
one
might
imagine
that
standards
could
be
imported
into
a
statute
which
is
silent.
i
think
it
is
asking
a
great
deal
to
expect
a
layman
or
indeed
a
lawyer
to
read
out
of
a
statute
a
series
of
vague
standards
then
to
read
into
the
statute
of
series
of
traffic
type
standards.
secondly,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
the
cox
case
was
decided
in
some
of
the
earlier
days
of
first
amendment
jurisprudence
in
this
court
and
it
may
be
that
the
court
at
this
time
was
not
sufficiently
alert
to
the
chilling
effect
that
such
a
retroactive
interpretation
might
have
and
further
that
the
court
had
not
really
fully
developed
its
jurisprudence
of
first
amendment
rights
to
apply
to
march
as
in
parading
or
picketing
of
that
sort.
but
in
any
event,
even
if
the
statute
could
be
said
to
be
now
made
constitutional
in
retrospect
of
the
by
reading
out
and
reading
in,
we
say
that
in
a
procedural
sense,
it
is
not
constitutional
in
the
sense
of
the
--
of
bantam
books
case
and
the
interstate
circuit
case
which
says
that
on
first
amendment
rights
it
denied
they
must
be
speedy,
precise,
and
efficacious
opportunity
for
review
and
that
none
of
that
exist
here
ago.
it's
not
even
as
reconstructive
standards
like
were
not
read
into
the
statute.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
mr.
justice
harlan
but
we
would
say
that
an
a
fortiori
should
apply,
perhaps
not
necessary
to
a
case
involving
use
of
the
streets
but
to
a
case
involving
what
one
might
call
political
rights.
because
i
think
it
might
be
argued
that
in
the
case
involving
a
book
or
a
motion
picture
for
example,
while
it
is
undesirable
and
it
is
unconstitutional
to
frustrate
or
delay
the
publication
or
the
showing
of
the
motion
picture
that
something
which
involves
the
political
considerations
in
which
timeliness
is
exceedingly
important
and
the
necessity
for
avoiding
delay
is
crucial
as
it
was
in
this
case.
the
good
friday
march
had
a
significance
on
good
friday
and
on
easter
sunday
as
such
that
a
fortiori
that
rapid
in
effect
of
review
notion
should
apply
to
this
kind
of
a
case,
even
more
so
than
to
a
movie
case.
but
the
cox
case,
the
point
we
make
in
addition
did
not
address
itself.
perhaps,
it
wasn't
raised
in
the
case
that
to
the
fair
notice
doctrine.
this
petitioner,
according
to
the
law
as
it
stood
then
and
as
he
under
any
reason
besides
the
degree
of
the
statute
had
reason
to
believe
that
he
could
march
with
impunity.
he
did
not
have
fair
notice
that
five
years
later,
the
statute
would
be
reconstructed
in
a
way
which
could
convict
him.
in
this
court,
not
long
ago
in
this
case
of
bouie
against
city
of
columbia
which
was
one
of
the
“sit-in”
cases
dealt
with
the
trespass
statute
and
the
court
may
recall
that
statute
said
it
was
a
misdemeanor
to
enter
upon
the
lands
of
another
after
notice
from
the
owner
prohibiting
entry
and
the
petitioner
of
that
case
entered
upon
the
lands.
he
did
not
have
notice
prohibiting
entry.
he
was
told
to
leave
the
supreme
court
of
alabama's,
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
so
that's
means
the
same
thing
and
this
court
said
no,
he
did
not
have
fair
notice
that
the
retrospect
interpretation
of
the
statute
would
cover
this
particular
situation.
well,
the
case
us
entirely
precise,
i
think
the
notion
of
retrospective
interpretation
to
convict
without
fair
notice
is
applicable
in
this
case
as
well
as
in
the
bouie
case.
i'd
like
to
address
for
a
moment
the
question
of
fair
procedure
which
i
say
i
think
is
crucial
in
this
case
because
the
statute
remains
unconstitutionally
even
after
rewritten.
there
is
no
regularity,
nothing
provided
for
in
the
ordinance
concerning
administrative
procedure
in
processing
applications.
so
far
as
practices
concerned
there
is
no
evidence
concerning
that.
there
are
no
reasons
to
be
given
as
to
where
the
permit
is
denied.
there
was
an
effort
to
develop
upon
cross-examination
of
the
witness
sarah
nagar
(ph)
who
gave
out
the
permits.
when
questioned
--
developed
when
permits
are
granted
and
when
they
are
denied
and
are
they
given
for
walking
in
the
sidewalks
as
distinguished
from
working
in
the
streets.
that
line
of
questioning
was
cut-off
very
soon
after
it
began
so
that
was
not
even
possible
to
develop
this
at
the
trial.
there
are
no
time
limits,
lengthy
or
brief.
there
are
some
suggestions
about
judicial
review
but
as
the
best
we
can
divide
from
alabama
law
judicial
review
would
then
at
least
involve
30
days
for
answering
the
trial
court
and
there
are
no
stated
precise
periods
for
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
and
the
scope
of
review
was
extremely
narrow
would
be
by
mandamus
or
certiorari
at
which
all
one
reviews
is
the
discretion
of
the
grant
or
order
of
the
permit
and
in
a
statute
as
vague
as
this,
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
litigate
something
else
of
that
sort.
so
for
all
these
reasons,
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
conviction
of
petitioner
fred
shuttlesworth
should
not
be
permitted
to
stand
that
the
statute
as
rewritten
does
not
say
that
conviction
that
even
if
in
a
substantive
sense
and
as
to
future
defendants
that
statute
might
be
filed
in
a
procedural
sense
it
is
and
remains
unconstitutional.
mr.
jack
greenberg
we
have
nothing
further
to
add
your
honor.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
justice
black
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
which
reversed
the
alabama
court
of
appeals
which
in
turn
had
reversed
the
circuit
court
of
jefferson
county
which
had
convicted
this
petitioner
for
violating
a
birmingham
ordinance
requiring
a
permit
before
a
procession
or
a
parade
may
be
held.
the
petitioner,
fred
shuttlesworth,
was
sentenced
to
90
days
in
jail
plus
48
days
in
lieu
of
paying
a
fine
and
cost
for
parading
in
violation
of
this
ordinance
which
appears
on
page
4
of
our
brief.
mr.
jack
greenberg
this
was
in
1963.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
case
was
tried
in
the
recorder's
court
in
may
1963
in
the
circuit
court
in
october
1963.
an
appeal
was
promptly
taken
to
the
alabama
court
of
appeals
which
did
not
decide
the
case
until
1965.
the
state
of
alabama
then
took
it
to
the
alabama
supreme
court
which
did
not
decide
the
case
until
november
1967
and
we
promptly
took
it
here.
the
time
was
essentially
spent
in
a
very
lengthy
consideration
or
the
very
lengthy
time
that
was
consumed
while
the
case
was
pending
before
the
two
alabama
courts.
the
ordinance
in
question
which
appears
on
page
4
of
our
brief
states
that,
“it
shall
be
unlawful
to
organize
or
hold
or
assist
in
organizing
and
holding
a
parade
or
procession
or
other
public
demonstration
unless
a
permit
has
been
secured.”
and
then
it
sets
forth
standards
according
to
which
the
permit
may
be
granted
or
denied.
and
those
standards
include
beginning
on
the
very
last
line
on
page
4
of
our
brief,
public
welfare,
peace,
safety,
health,
decency,
good
order,
morals,
or
convenience.
as
i
stated,
this
arose
in
1963
and
this
is
what
one
might
call
a
prototype
case.
this
is
the
case
of
the
one
petitioner
whose
conviction
has
been
appealed
and
there
area
approximately
1500
other
cases
pending
in
the
juvenile
court
and
the
circuit
court
of
jefferson
county
awaiting
disposition
of
this
case.
the
case
arose
at
what
one
may
call
a
classical
type
of
civil
rights
march.
mr.
jack
greenberg
approximately
1500,
about
900
in
the
juvenile
court
and
600
in
the
circuit
court
are
being
held
pending
the
outcome
of
this
case.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
other
persons
were
prosecuted
for
violation
of
this
ordinance
during
this
--
these
has
occurred
during
the
series
of
demonstrations
in
birmingham
but
in
1963
which
openly
led
to
the
passage
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act
and
there
were
a
series
of
demonstrations
and
marches
over
a
period
of
some
time.
and
while
there
were
only,
there
were
52
persons
arrested
in
this
particular
demonstration,
there
were
1,500
altogether.
this
--
the
civil
rights
march
was
one
might
call
a
classical
type
of
civil
rights
march.
the
group
of
marchers
of
which
petitioners,
shuttlesworth
with
which
he
was
connected
left
the
church
at
approximately
2:00
or
2:30
in
the
afternoon.
they
walked
in
the
sidewalks.
they
were
entirely
orderly.
there
was
no
question
about
that
at
all.
they
proceeded
approximately
four
or
somewhat
more
than
four
blocks
and
then
they
were
stopped
by
police
officers
who
asked
whether
or
not
they
had
a
permit.
and
when
they
did
not
--
when
they
said
they
did
not
have
a
permit
they
were
arrested.
i
might
state
that
the
respondent's
brief
is
written
in
an
effort
--
were
written
as
if
this
was
some
sort
of
disorderly
conduct
or
breach
of
the
peace
case.
the
fact
is
that
petitioners
were
not
prosecuted
for
anything
of
the
sort.
they
were
prosecuted
for
parading
without
a
permit.
the
opinion
of
judge
johnson
in
the
court
of
appeals
which
has
been
adopted
essentially
by
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
is
expressed
on
the
fact
that
petitioners
who
orderly
--
the
testimony
of
police
officers
is
unequivocal
that
they
were
orderly.
there
was
a
group
of
demonst
--
there
was
a
group
of
onlookers.
there
is
some
dispute
as
to
whether
or
not
the
onlookers
were
disorderly.
they
were
however
a
discrete
group
and
even
the
alleged
disorder
which
came
out
of
the
conduct
of
the
onlookers
occurred
after
the
arrest
and
it
seems
that
i
don't
think
it
can
be
seriously
contended
or
contended
at
all
that
these
petitioners
acted
in
violation
of
any
disorderly
conduct
or
breach
of
the
peace
statute.
indeed,
they
have
not
been
prosecuted
for
that.
now,
judge
katz's
opinion
in
the
alabama
court
of
appeals
which
reversed
the
conviction
of
the
trial
court
is
a
lengthy
opinion
appearing
at
page
88
of
the
record
however,
it
is
summarized
in
his
conclusion
in
a
brief
section
on
page
143.
and
his
position
was
that
the
permit
ordinance
is
unconstitutional
because
it
is
vague
and
includes
such
terms
as
welfare,
decency,
and
good
morals
which
were
not
ascertained
susceptible
of
any
precise
meaning.
relying
upon
judicial
notice
of
records
in
several
alabama
cases,
he
held
that
the
pattern
of
enforcement
that
is
prosecuted
in
these
petitioners
for
walking
down
the
sidewalk
was
discriminatory
in
the
sense
of
yick
wo
against
hopkins.
and
he
also
held
this
third
point
that
there
was
no
need
shown,
no
state
interest
shown
in
enforcing
an
ordinance
of
this
sort
against
persons
who
were
merely
walking
down
the
sidewalk.
the
dissenting
opinion
of
judge
johnson
which
was
adopted
and
without
any
variation
really
by
the
alabama
supreme
court
consisted
essentially
of
reconstruction
of
the
statute
in
the
mode
of
cox
against
new
hampshire.
he
read
the
statute
and
he
said,
here's
the
statute
contains
the
words
“decency
and
morals
and
welfare
and
the
various
other
vague
terms”
he
said
but
i
read
all
those
terms
out
of
the
statutes
so
those
words
are
no
longer
there.
and
now
he
said
i'm
going
to
read
something
into
the
statute.
and
after
having
read
that
out,
he
read
into
the
statute
of
those
traffic
considerations
and
considerations
that
avert
to
convenience
of
the
public
which
is
the
basis
of
cox
decision
and
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
said
that's
right.
we
read
out
the
bad
words
and
read
them
some
good
words
and
therefore
the
conviction
stands.
now,
our
position
in
this
case
in
summary
is
that
under
decisions
of
this
court,
it
uniformly
has
been
held
that
a
permit
ordinance
which
imposes
a
prior
restraint
in
first
amendment
rights
may
be
disobeyed
with
impunity
if
it
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
and
this
court
has
held
that
in
staub
versus
baxley
and
lovell
against
griffin
and
case
after
case
since
then.
there
seems
to
be
--
it
seems
to
be
conceded
that
the
language
and
question
of
just
to
take
three
of
the
terms:
welfare,
decency,
and
morals
are
so
vague
that
they
aren't
unconstitutional.
indeed,
that's
why
they
were
read
out
of
the
statute
by
judge
johnson
and
by
the
alabama
supreme
court.
there
is
the
question
of
the
cox
case.
our
position
of
the
cox
case
and
i
will
come
to
that
in
a
moment.
it
is
that
it
is
distinguishable
and
that
in
event
it
did
not
take
into
account.
it
did
not
discuss
certain
due
process,
considerations
of
fair
notice
which
reveal
our
central
to
this
petition.
mr.
jack
greenberg
cox
(voice
overlap),
i
will
be
speaking
about
against
cox
against
new
hampshire.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh,
no.
no,
providing
that
it
meets
certain
substantive
and
we
might
add
certain
procedural
standards
and
we
say
that
this
statute
as
rewritten
even
if
it
were
constitutional
as
rewritten.
first,
it
cannot
be
applied
to
convict
this
petition
or
who
acted
before
it
was
rewritten
and
secondly,
we
claim
it
is
not
constitutional
in
any
event
because
it
does
not
provide
for
a
speedy
review
and
certain
standards,
record
keeping,
and
so
forth
that
would
be
necessary
useful
upon
review.
secondly,
we
claim
that
five
years
after
the
event,
the
statute
cannot
be
reconstructed
without
filing
motions
of
fair
notice
to
convict
this
petitioner
would
go
in
a
substantive
sense
distinguished
from
the
procedural
sense
such
a
rewritten
statute
that
might
by
constitutional.
now,
under
decisions
of
this
court
as
i
stated
at
the
outset,
a
march
made
without
a
permit
contrary
to
a
regulation
requiring
a
permit
is
constitutional
and
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment
if
the
permit,
ordinance,
or
regulation
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
now,
it's
conceded
that
this
ordinance
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
and
i've
seen
no
arguments
serious
otherwise
made
to
the
contrary.
an
alternative
would
be
if
the
staub
doctrine
and
the
lovell
doctrine
were
not
the
law
of
this
court
that
dissenters
before
they
marched
would
have
to
engage
in
expensive
litigation
as
in,
let
us
say
the
dombrowski
case
or
would
have
to
submit
themselves
to
lengthy
administrative
proceedings
and
there
would
be
chill
upon
free
expression.
a
petitioner
in
case
such
as
this
would
be
in
a
especially
grave
disadvantage
in
an
administrative
proceeding
because
and
in
a
judicial
proceeding
because
the
scope
of
review
on
appeal
in
the
alabama
courts
is
so
circumscribed
that
in
dealing
with
a
vague
statute,
he
would
have
great
difficulty
in
proving
just
what
right
of
his
head
been
denied.
but
this
ordinance
like
the
one
in
the
cox
case
was
construed
in
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
for
the
first
time
apparently
to
make
it
constitutional
and
it
held,
but
was
held
below
the
cox
save
the
ordinance
and
save
the
conviction.
our
position
is
as
i
stated
before
that
even
if
this
were
the
case
it
could
not
save
the
ordinance
in
the
sense
that
it
could
convict
this
petitioner.
we
distinguish
the
cox
case
on
a
variety
of
grounds.
first
of
all,
in
cox,
there
was
a
statute
which
was
essentially
blank
as
to
standard
and
it
is
conceivable
that
one
might
have
read
that
ordinance
and
he
said,
well,
what
is
it
they
mean
and
reasonably
might
apply
the
traffic
considerations.
but
here's
a
statute
which
quite
explicitly
has
other
standards
that
welfare,
decency,
good
order,
and
so
forth
and
one
need
not
be
at
a
loss
to
guess
what
the
state
means.
the
state
means
these
various
vague
general
things
which
one
can't
really
--
about
which
one
really
can't
predict
whether
one
is
entitled
to
march
or
not.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
standards.
it
just
said,
you
needed
a
permit.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
that
was
--
i
think
it
was,
yes.
you
just
said
you
needed
a
permit
but
it
did
not
have
any
standards
in
it.
this
case
on
the
contrary
has
a
series
of
vague
standards
and
its
while,
i
would
not
agree
with
this
but
it
would
be
conceivable
to
say
that
one
might
imagine
that
standards
could
be
imported
into
a
statute
which
is
silent.
i
think
it
is
asking
a
great
deal
to
expect
a
layman
or
indeed
a
lawyer
to
read
out
of
a
statute
a
series
of
vague
standards
then
to
read
into
the
statute
of
series
of
traffic
type
standards.
secondly,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
the
cox
case
was
decided
in
some
of
the
earlier
days
of
first
amendment
jurisprudence
in
this
court
and
it
may
be
that
the
court
at
this
time
was
not
sufficiently
alert
to
the
chilling
effect
that
such
a
retroactive
interpretation
might
have
and
further
that
the
court
had
not
really
fully
developed
its
jurisprudence
of
first
amendment
rights
to
apply
to
march
as
in
parading
or
picketing
of
that
sort.
but
in
any
event,
even
if
the
statute
could
be
said
to
be
now
made
constitutional
in
retrospect
of
the
by
reading
out
and
reading
in,
we
say
that
in
a
procedural
sense,
it
is
not
constitutional
in
the
sense
of
the
--
of
bantam
books
case
and
the
interstate
circuit
case
which
says
that
on
first
amendment
rights
it
denied
they
must
be
speedy,
precise,
and
efficacious
opportunity
for
review
and
that
none
of
that
exist
here
ago.
it's
not
even
as
reconstructive
standards
like
were
not
read
into
the
statute.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
mr.
justice
harlan
but
we
would
say
that
an
a
fortiori
should
apply,
perhaps
not
necessary
to
a
case
involving
use
of
the
streets
but
to
a
case
involving
what
one
might
call
political
rights.
because
i
think
it
might
be
argued
that
in
the
case
involving
a
book
or
a
motion
picture
for
example,
while
it
is
undesirable
and
it
is
unconstitutional
to
frustrate
or
delay
the
publication
or
the
showing
of
the
motion
picture
that
something
which
involves
the
political
considerations
in
which
timeliness
is
exceedingly
important
and
the
necessity
for
avoiding
delay
is
crucial
as
it
was
in
this
case.
the
good
friday
march
had
a
significance
on
good
friday
and
on
easter
sunday
as
such
that
a
fortiori
that
rapid
in
effect
of
review
notion
should
apply
to
this
kind
of
a
case,
even
more
so
than
to
a
movie
case.
but
the
cox
case,
the
point
we
make
in
addition
did
not
address
itself.
perhaps,
it
wasn't
raised
in
the
case
that
to
the
fair
notice
doctrine.
this
petitioner,
according
to
the
law
as
it
stood
then
and
as
he
under
any
reason
besides
the
degree
of
the
statute
had
reason
to
believe
that
he
could
march
with
impunity.
he
did
not
have
fair
notice
that
five
years
later,
the
statute
would
be
reconstructed
in
a
way
which
could
convict
him.
in
this
court,
not
long
ago
in
this
case
of
bouie
against
city
of
columbia
which
was
one
of
the
“sit-in”
cases
dealt
with
the
trespass
statute
and
the
court
may
recall
that
statute
said
it
was
a
misdemeanor
to
enter
upon
the
lands
of
another
after
notice
from
the
owner
prohibiting
entry
and
the
petitioner
of
that
case
entered
upon
the
lands.
he
did
not
have
notice
prohibiting
entry.
he
was
told
to
leave
the
supreme
court
of
alabama's,
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
so
that's
means
the
same
thing
and
this
court
said
no,
he
did
not
have
fair
notice
that
the
retrospect
interpretation
of
the
statute
would
cover
this
particular
situation.
well,
the
case
us
entirely
precise,
i
think
the
notion
of
retrospective
interpretation
to
convict
without
fair
notice
is
applicable
in
this
case
as
well
as
in
the
bouie
case.
i'd
like
to
address
for
a
moment
the
question
of
fair
procedure
which
i
say
i
think
is
crucial
in
this
case
because
the
statute
remains
unconstitutionally
even
after
rewritten.
there
is
no
regularity,
nothing
provided
for
in
the
ordinance
concerning
administrative
procedure
in
processing
applications.
so
far
as
practices
concerned
there
is
no
evidence
concerning
that.
there
are
no
reasons
to
be
given
as
to
where
the
permit
is
denied.
there
was
an
effort
to
develop
upon
cross-examination
of
the
witness
sarah
nagar
(ph)
who
gave
out
the
permits.
when
questioned
--
developed
when
permits
are
granted
and
when
they
are
denied
and
are
they
given
for
walking
in
the
sidewalks
as
distinguished
from
working
in
the
streets.
that
line
of
questioning
was
cut-off
very
soon
after
it
began
so
that
was
not
even
possible
to
develop
this
at
the
trial.
there
are
no
time
limits,
lengthy
or
brief.
there
are
some
suggestions
about
judicial
review
but
as
the
best
we
can
divide
from
alabama
law
judicial
review
would
then
at
least
involve
30
days
for
answering
the
trial
court
and
there
are
no
stated
precise
periods
for
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
and
the
scope
of
review
was
extremely
narrow
would
be
by
mandamus
or
certiorari
at
which
all
one
reviews
is
the
discretion
of
the
grant
or
order
of
the
permit
and
in
a
statute
as
vague
as
this,
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
litigate
something
else
of
that
sort.
so
for
all
these
reasons,
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
conviction
of
petitioner
fred
shuttlesworth
should
not
be
permitted
to
stand
that
the
statute
as
rewritten
does
not
say
that
conviction
that
even
if
in
a
substantive
sense
and
as
to
future
defendants
that
statute
might
be
filed
in
a
procedural
sense
it
is
and
remains
unconstitutional.
mr.
jack
greenberg
we
have
nothing
further
to
add
your
honor.
