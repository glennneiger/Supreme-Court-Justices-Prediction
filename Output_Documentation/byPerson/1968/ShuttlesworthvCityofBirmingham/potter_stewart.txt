justice

i
don't
see
how
any
issue
of
an
injunction
is
in
this
case.
i
didn't
understand
it
to
be
after
having
read
carefully
read
your
brief
and
that
of
your
opponent.
justice
potter
stewart
well
this
is
a
conviction
for
holding
a
parade
without
a
permit?
justice
potter
stewart
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
--
there
are
no
issues
here
of
disorderly
conduct,
of
violence,
or
defiance
of
a
court
order.
none
of
those
things
were
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
disobey
a
court
order
and
that's
not
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
but
except
mr.
mcbee,
they
must
have
raised
it
because
in
the
court
of
appeals,
judge
katz's
opinion,
i'm
reading
now
from
the
very
last
paragraph
of
his
very
lengthy
opinion
appearing
on
143
of
the
record
here
says,
“that
the
city
failed
to
make
a
case
under
the
purported
meaning
of
section
1159
of
there
being
a
need
for
the
appellant
in
this
case
to
be
covered
by
a
permit
to
use
the
sidewalk
in
company
with
others.”
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
a
clear
holding
as
i
read
it,
you
tell
me
if
i'm
mistaken
that
this,
the
ordinance
at
issue
here
is
simply
was
not
applicable
to
the
conduct
of
this
petitioners
and
if
there's
that
much
and
then
i
understand
of
course
that
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
disagreed
with
that.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
that
much
room
for
disagreement
as
appears
that
there
was
here
between
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
supreme
court
doesn't
the
--
don't
the
petitioners
have
a
very
valid
fairly
notice
argument
as
to
the
very
meaning
and
coverage
of
this
ordinance?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
understand
him
to
be
necessarily
making
a
decision
between
the
paved
part
of
the
street
and
the
sidewalk
part
of
the
public
way
but
rather,
just
to
use
the
streets
in
company
with
others.
as
i
understand,
i
think
i
would
gather,
perhaps
again,
i'm
wrong
that
his
language
could
simply
be
construed
52
people
which
he
elsewhere
characterizes
in
this
very
lengthy
56-page
opinion
as
about
the
size
of
a
football
squad
walking
down
the
street
simply
is
not
the
kind
of
procession
or
parade
contemplated
by
the
birmingham
ordinance.
now,
and
he
holds
that
as
a
matter
of
--
or
in
your
intermediate
court
of
appeals
in
alabama
and
as
this
court
is
clear
that
the
supreme
court
subsequently
disagreed.
but
if
say
if
there's
not
much
doubt
about
it,
don't
the
petitioners
have
a
very
colorable
argument
with
respect
to
the
notice
that
the
ordinance
gave
him?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
walker
opinion
rather
relied
on
his
opinion,
didn't
it?
at
least
referred
to
in
the
footnote?
justice
potter
stewart
to
the
effect
that
this

has
been
held
to
be
unconstitutional?
justice

he
pointed
out
that
