mr.
earl
mcbee
mr.
justice
black
and
may
it
please
the
court.
some
18
months
ago,
i
believe,
i
was
--
had
the
privilege
of
appearing
before
this
court
in
reference
to
the
case
of
walker
versus
the
city
of
birmingham
which
we
think
is
a
closely
related
case
in
as
much
as
it
deals
with
the
identical
parade
and
of
course
it
deals
with
and
involves
the
same
parties,
that
is
to
say
the
city
of
birmingham
and
in
this
instance
the
respondent
rather
petitioner
f.l.
shuttlesworth.
we
think
that
the
facts
in
that
case
should
be
considered
in
this
case
because
they
are
related
and
as
least
we
believe
that
the
court
has
authority
to
so
consider.
we
would
like
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
the
city
of
birmingham
at
the
time
this
particular
litigation
began,
there
had
been
a
number
of
mass
parades
and
lead
again
to
the
balance
and
attacks
the
police
department
city
of
birmingham
to
protect
the
demonstrators
and
also
to
protect
the
citizens
of
the
city
of
birmingham.
on
the
evening
of,
the
10th
of
november
--
10th
of
april,
the
city
acquired
and
injunction
from
the
state
court
enjoying
the
holding
of
mass
parades
in
violation
of
1159,
that's
answer
the
question.
the
reaction
to
that
injunction
was
an
immediate
denial
of
any
right
of
the
state
or
any
intent
of
the
parties
involving
the
petitioner
to
pay
any
attention
to
the
injunction
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
said
that
the
injunction
was
not
to
be
respected
or
not
to
obeyed
but
they
did
not
believe
in
obeying
laws
that
they
consider
to
be
opposed
to
there
way
of
lying.
mr.
earl
mcbee
no,
sir.
(voice
overlap)
i
don't
mean
to
be
doing
that
but
i
just
mean
to
attract
to
connect
the
two
cases
in
this
respect
that
there
was
an
effort
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner
here
to
say
that
he
had
been
mistreated
and
misled
into
the
arrest
on
this
occasion
and
we
believe
that
the
facts
in
the
walker
case
are
at
least
to
some
extent
relevant.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
we
agree
that
it
is
not
an
issue
in
the
case
but
we
believe,
thought
at
least
that
the
factual
situation
was
relevant.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir,
that's
true.
mr.
earl
mcbee
i
believe
that's
correct
that
there's
no
question
of
any
mess
conduct
on
the
part
of
this
particular
defendants
in
the
sense
of
any
disorderly
conduct.
and
it
won
in
that
case
either
but
they
did
say
that
they
were
going
to
disobey
the
law.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes,
sir.
and
the
facts
in
the
case
in
this
particular
instance,
there's
no
question
about
that
the
evidence
clearly
shows
the
violation
of
the
law.
now,
the
question
of
the
precedent
before
the
court
in
which
the
court
must
consider
as
we
believe
in
determining
the
rightfulness
or
the
wrongfulness
of
the
conviction
in
this
case
will
be
among
other
things
of
course
the
cox
case,
that's
new
hampshire-cox
case.
now,
the
new
hampshire-cox
case
did
not
place
any
sort
of
restriction
upon
the
issuance
of
the
license.
the
license
was
particularly
and
fully
and
completely
based
upon
a
monetary
consideration
plus
whatever
construe,
whatever
restrictions
they
--
might
decide
it
want
to
put
into
it.
for
example,
they
could
if
they
wanted
to
use
racial
lines
or
for
denying
the
application.
they
could
use
with
each
lines
to
deny
their
application.
they
could
also
presumably
use
any
other
criteria
for
the
denying
the
application.
in
considering
the
question,
and
we
don't
believe
that
the
ordinance
in
1159
is
any
more
void
and
invalid
than
is
the
ordinance
in
the
case
of
cox
because
of
the
fact
that
there
was
reference
to
some
action
on
the
part
of
the
court
in
connection
of
the
city
commission
in
connection
with
the
various
assets
--
the
various
aspects
of
the
police
power
of
the
city.
in
other
words,
it
does
relate
to
specifically
aspects
of
the
police
power.
now,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
in
each
ruling
which
by
the
way
followed
the
ruling
of
this
court
in
the
case
of
walker
versus
--
the
city
of
birmingham
versus
walker
did
hold
in
line
with
that
case
that
the
ordinance
was
not
unconstitutional.
now,
there's
been
a
question
raised
as
to
why
this
court
of
alabama
waived
so
long.
i
have
a
strong
suspicion
that
probably
they
were
waiting
until
the
court,
this
court
made
this
decision
in
the
walker
case.
and
the
court
in
this
case
in
the
walker
case
was
dealing
with
the
particular
ordinance
in
question
and
of
course
was
certainly
expected
and
anticipated
they
would
gear
some
guidelines
for
the
alabama
court
to
follow.
i
think
that
there
is
some
misapprehension,
at
least
in
the
argument
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case
as
to
the
significance
of
the
two
lines
of
cases.
now,
we
certainly
reflect
and
know
that
there
are
some
admissible
regulations
that
can
be
used
in
connection
with
parades
and
other
types
of
actions
upon
the
streets
of
the
cities.
but
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
also
in
the
connection
with
the
regular
pure
speech
cases,
a
less
privilege
on
the
part
of
the
local
government
governing
bodies
to
present
and
to
enforce
regulations
which
restrict
or
do
impair
the
right
of
the
demonstrators
or
the
people
using
free
speech.
in
the
cox
case,
the
court
made
it
clear
that
there
is
a
difference
in
the
use
of
public
streets
and
in
pure
speech.
if
a
municipality
has
authority
to
control
the
use
of
the
public
streets
for
parades
or
processions
as
on
the
others,
it
cannot
be
denied
authority
to
give
consideration
without
unfair
discrimination,
time,
place
and
manner
in
relation
to
the
other
proper
uses
of
the
streets.
we
find
the
impossible
to
say
the
limited
authority
conferred
by
the
licensing
provisions
of
statutes
in
question
as
thus
construed
by
the
state
court
contravened
any
constitutional
right
that
must
be
borne
in
mind
please
that
this
statute
was
construed
just
as
in
our
case
in
a
conviction
situation
involving
cox.
and
it
was
construed
post
the
act
of
--
for
which
he
was
convicted
that
is
after
which
he
was
convicted.
the
conviction
was
upheld
and
we
think
in
line
with
other
decisions
of
this
honorable
court
for
the
reason
that
when
he
violated
the
ordinance,
he
did
so
with
the
fact
that
it
was
conceivable
that
a
valid
construction
could
be
placed
upon
the
ordinance
which
would
render
it
valid
and
which
would
render
it
constitutional
and
he
then
did
at
his
peril
violate
the
particular
constitutional
that
is
particular
as
it
could
be
made
about
it
by
the
construction
of
the
courts.
we've
come
on
to
the
walker
case
and
of
course
i
think
mr.
greenberg
refers
to
the
fact
that
lovell
and
staub
and
freedman,
the
doctrine
of
those
cases
are
at
odds
with
the
holding
of
the
court
in
alabama
court
in
this
case.
but
however,
in
the
walker
case,
we
find
the
reference
to
cox
versus
louisiana
in
which
the
court
said
that
we
emphatically
reject
the
notion
that
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
before
the
same
kind
of
freedom,
those
who
have
communicate
ideas
by
conduct
such
as
patrolling,
marching,
and
picketing
on
streets
and
highways
as
these
amendments
afford
to
those
who
communicate
ideas
by
pure
speech.
and
at
another
point
in
while
he
walks
a
case
the
court
said
the
authority
of
a
municipality
to
impose
regulations
in
order
to
assure
safety
and
convenience
to
people
and
the
use
of
public
and
highways
has
never
been
regard
as
inconsistent
with
several
liberties
but
rather
as
one
of
the
means
of
safeguarding
is
good
order
in
which
there
are
defend.
and
then,
going
on
over
to
the
question
of
this
particular
ordinance,
the
generality
of
the
language
contained
the
birmingham
ordinance
upon
which
the
injunction
was
based
will
unquestionably
raised
substantial
constitutional
issue
concerning
some
of
its
provisions
and
the
citation
of
a
number
of
cases.
the
petitioners
however
did
not
even
attempt
to
apply
to
the
alabama
courts
from
authoritative
construction
of
the
ordinance
and
this
we
think
is
very
significant.
had
they
done
so,
those
courts
might
have
given
the
licensing
authority
granting
the
ordinance
in
narrow
and
precise
code
as
did
the
new
hampshire
courts
in
cox
versus
state
of
new
hampshire
and
poulos
versus
new
hampshire.
here
just
as
in
cox
and
poulos,
it
could
not
be
assumed
that
this
ordinance
was
void
on
its
face.
and
then
going
into
question
of
the
application
of
the
ordinance,
the
petitioners
also
claim
they
were
afraid
to
dissipate
the
injunction
because
of
great
ordinance
in
which
it
was
based
had
been
admonished
in
the
past
and
arbitrated
in
the
right
fashion.
these
precedents
and
that
is
to
say
the
(inaudible)
and
other
precedents
clearly
put
the
petitioner
unnoticed
they
could
not
bypass
all
the
judicial
review
and
claim
that
they
were
entrap
or
misled
as
wholly
and
founded.
a
conclusion
confirmed
by
evidence
of
the
record
showing
that
when
they
petitioner
deliberately
violate
the
injunction,
they
expect
to
go
to
jail.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
we
think
that
the
significance
of
that
is
this.
that
the
precedent
of
cox
versus
new
hampshire
was
booked
and
also
poulos
versus
new
hampshire
was
available
to
the
petitioners.
now,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
at
that
time
he
violated
the
injunction
and
violated
the
ordinance
1159
and
this
justice
as
what
(inaudible)
be
a
precedent
which
he
was
informed
of
should
have
known
about
so
these
list
of
decisions
were
known
to
him
or
should
have
known
to
him
and
he
could
not
claim
entrapment
because
he
did
know
about
those
or
should
have
known
about
them.
and
also,
the
evidence
show
that
they
did
--
knew
they
actually
did
with
the
expectation
of
going
to
jail.
now,
so
far
as
cox
versus
new
hampshire
is
concerned,
we
find
that
that
case
has
an
also
poulos
versus
state
of
new
hampshire
has
been
accepted
by
the
courts
with
a
steady
and
an
unbroken
line
and
i
suppose
have
been
cited
maybe
at
least
50,000
times.
there
are
sound
decisions
they
--
coming
on
down
through
of
course
in
1965
of
the
cox
versus
louisiana
and
by
the
way
the
decision
in
the
walker
case
in
1967
and
then
the
most
recent
case
is
amalgamated
food
employees
union
versus
logan
plaza.
and
in
that
case,
mr.
justice
marshall
writing
for
the
court
and
i
believe
there
was
concurring
opinion
and
one
dissent,
says
in
addition,
the
first
--
the
excise
of
first
amendment
rights
may
be
regulated
with
such
exercise
was
unduly
interfered
with
normal
use
of
the
public
property
by
other
members
of
the
public
with
an
equal
right
to
access
to
it.
thus,
it
has
been
held
that
persons
designed
to
parade
along
city
streets
may
be
required
to
secure
a
permit
in
order
that
he
may
an
autonomous
authorities
may
be
able
to
limit
now
and
interference
with
the
use
of
the
sidewalks
by
other
members
of
the
public
by
regulating
the
time,
place,
and
manner
of
the
parade.
now,
of
course
as
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
has
construed
the
1159,
that
is
the
ordinance
can
only
be
applied
in
reference
to
actually
the
good
order
and
the
convenience
and
use
of
the
streets.
the
essential
contention
as
we
understand
it
is
being
made
at
this
time
that
the
ordinance
did
not
give
fair
notice.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
bouie
has
been
referred
to
and
i
believe
lanzetta.
the
bouie
case
involved
a
situation
where
the
facts
showed
an
intent
to
apply
an
ordinance
to
a
factual
situation
that
it
wasn't
space
designed
to
accommodate.
for
instance,
the
ordinance
was
designed
to
prevent
or
rather
to
punish
going
up
on
property
when
you
are
not
to
go
on
it.
it
was
applied
to
a
situation
where
the
(inaudible)
already
own
it
without
the
notice
being
put
up
and
want
to
get
off.
and
of
course,
that
construction
was
not
the
one
that
the
ordinance
on
its
face
show
that
the
possibility
of
then
therefore
the
courts
held
that
it
was
not
fair
notice.
lanzetta
was
a
situation
where
anybody
who
was
a
member
of
a
gang.
but
the
gang
consisted
two
or
more
people
which
of
course
was
too
broad
and
no
one
could
ever
describe
what
a
gang
was
really
and
that
is
know
what
a
gang
was
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
now
in
reference
to
the
question
of
fair
notice
and
the
administrative
procedures,
here
again,
the
court
in
poulos
versus
new
hampshire
had
occasion
to
deal
with
that
particular
and
specific
problem.
in
that
case,
the
ordinance
had
or
rather
statute
had
or
ordinance
whichever
one
it
was,
had
been
construed
by
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire
and
have
been
approved
by
the
court
by
this
court
in
the
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice,
chief
justice
hughes.
the
court
in
the
poulos
case
said
that
that
case
had
been
made
for
a
permit
but
wrongfully
the
licensing
authorities
had
refused
to
grant
the
permit.
and
because
they
had
refused
to
grant
the
permit,
the
defendant
had
proceeded
to
violate
it.
now,
as
he
proceeded
to
go
ahead
and
have
his
speech
of
whatever
it's
going
to
have
without
the
benefit
of
the
permit.
the
question
was
raised
that
in
this
court
that
to
have
put
him
in
that
situation
to
going
into
a
mandamus
proceeding
would
be
expensive,
would
be
difficult
for
him
to
accomplish
and
would
delay
him
in
his
exercise
of
his
freedom
of
speech
and
so
forth.
the
court
rejecting
that
argument
that
is
the
new
hampshire
court
rejecting
the
argument
and
said
that
that
would
not
be
permissible
because
he
had
a
remedy.
he
could
have
gone
into
the
courts
and
enforced
his
right
to
speak.
this
court
considering
that
question
said
that
that's
exactly
correct.
he
could
have
gone
into
court.
he
could
have
presented
his
wrongful
disallowance
of
the
permit
and
not
having
followed
that
procedure
which
the
state
courts
permitted
he
therefore,
was
not
entitled
protection
of
the
constitutional
amendment
that
he
was
relying
upon.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes,
sir?
mr.
earl
mcbee
oh,
no
sir.
no
sir,
they
would
not.
mr.
earl
mcbee
the
ordinance
as
construed
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
that
i
was
trying
to
answer
that
question
in
saying
this
that
there
was,
the
ordinance
does
have
as
construed
refers
to
formal,
actual
precision
type
of
walks.
they
have
the
same
issue
in
the
cox-new
hampshire
case
where
in
that
case
there
were
i
think
three
or
four
or
five
or
six
groups
or
some
10
to
15
walking
in
single
file.
peaceably
there
were
no
question
about
that.
nobody
raised
that
question
but
they
did
walk
in
single
file
and
the
issue
raised
was
whether
or
not
that
amounted
to
a
parade
within
the
meaning
of
the
ordinance.
and
of
course
that
was
a
--
they
held
that
to
be
a
violation
of
the
new
hampshire
statute
ordinance.
now,
in
this
case,
suppose
the
court
said
again,
it
must
be
a
formal
parade
and
of
course
the
reasons
why
we
think
that
a
permit
is
required
for
a
demonstration
or
a
parade
of
this
type
is
simply
this.
that
the
city
or
the
local
governing
body
is
required
by
law
by
this
court
to
provide
safeguarding
procedures
and
police
protection
to
take
care
of
a
possible
disorders
that
might
interfere
with
their
right
to
parade
and
of
course
in
this
instance,
if
they
had
no
permanent
requirement,
they
would
not
know
where
the
parade
was
to
be
or
when
was
it
to
be
or
what
route
was
it
to
take
and
we
have
no
information
as
to
what
to
do
in
providing
the
protection.
mr.
earl
mcbee
i
don't
know
of
any
likelihood
of
anybody
committing
disorder
in
a
crowd
walking
from
one
event
to
another
event.
i
never
have
heard
of
that
but
there
is
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
actually,
i
don't
believe
that
--
now,
of
course
that
the
question
of
the
participation
of
the
body
of
the
so-called
onlookers.
now,
that's
the
question
really
of
i
think
disputed
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
so-called
onlookers.
they
have
recruited
these
people
to
come
and
they
have
assembled
them
in
the
vicinity
of
the
church
and
while
they
only
about
52
came
out
of
the
church
in
the
formal
march
wearing
blue
jeans,
i
believe,
the
numbers
of
the
onlookers
which
came
along
were
took
up
around,
i
think
maybe
a
1000
or
1500
and
they
took
up
the
street
and
also
both
sidewalks.
they
were
blocking
those
sidewalks.
i
mean,
they
were
completely
utilizing
and
completely
in
mass
moving
on
and
preempting
the
use
of
both
sidewalks.
mr.
earl
mcbee
some
of
them
were
but
they
couldn't
catch
them,
not
very
many
of
them.
but
those
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
yes
and
i
think
but
then
those
that
went
peacefully
were
going
to
be
arrested.
that
was
the
part
of
the
procedure.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes,
sir.
they
have
recruited
people
to
be
arrested
and
go
to
jail
that's
what
they
came
there
for.
they
intended
to
do
that.
now,
they
have
purposes
in
mind,
i
suppose
money-raising
was
one
of
the
reasons
they
did
it.
i
wouldn't
of
course
be
certain
about
it
but
i
would
assume
that
that
was
for
other
reasons
of
their
own.
what
they
did,
they
did
recruit
people
to
come
and
to
march
and
to
be
arrested
and
they
were
arrested.
mr.
earl
mcbee
i
think
the
only
case
we've
tried
that
is
to
say
now
that
recorder's
court
trials
they
didn't
take
the
stand
at
all
with
that
call.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well
now,
the
only
thing
is,
may
it
please
the
court,
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
black,
there
was
no
--
this
is
the
only
case
that
has
been
tried
as
far
as
i
know
of
these
cases.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes,
it
went
to
circuit
court.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes,
it
did.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
there
main
objection
was
and
so
far
as
i
know
as
i
recall,
there
was
no
series
objection,
i
mean
series
denial
of
the
fact
that
they
paraded.
certainly,
the
evidence
was
clear
that
they
did.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes,
without
a
permit.
they
made
no
contention
they
ever
have
a
permit.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
that
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
also
have
notice.
they
--
i
think
there
was
some,
statement
made
at
some
point
along
the
line
that
perhaps
because
they
are
on
the
sidewalk
as
opposed
being
in
the
middle
of
the
street
that
they
probably
went
out,
possibly
not
violating
the
ordinance.
but
however
though,
there
was
in
this
city
code
a
section
which
defines
the
meaning
of
street
to
include
sidewalk.
mr.
earl
mcbee
it
had
been
in
all
these
years,
so
there
must
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
judge
katz
either
did
not
know
that
or
had
not
made
an
effort
to
find
out
because
if
it
was,
actually
in
the
law
of
the
city.
mr.
earl
mcbee
of
course,
we
think
this
--
we
think
that
that
court
of
appeals
primarily
was
addressing
itself
to
the
idea
that
it
was
a
street
rather
sidewalk
rather
than
a
street
case.
but
he
did
write
a
very
lengthy
opinion.
(voice
overlap)
and
we
frankly
think
that
he
would
not
have
written
the
opinion
had
he
had
benefited
the
walker
case
in
this
court
for
his
guidance
when
he
wrote
that
opinion.
but
he
did
write
it
very
lengthy
as
we
know.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
i
think
(voice
overlap).
mr.
earl
mcbee
i
think
it
mentioned
the
case
and
said
that,
of
course,
it
could
perhaps
be
construed
to
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
yes,
i
think
it
makes
him
that.
mr.
earl
mcbee
ah
--
we
would
like
to
make
one
more
observation
in
connection
with
the
organized
march
and
that
is
to
say
that
an
organized
march
does
compete
for
the
use
of
the
sidewalks
with
other
use
of
the
sidewalks
on
the
part
of
people
who
have
the
right
to
use
them
and
that's
the
reason
why
an
organized
march
which
is
known
to
be
planned
requires
a
permit.
if
it
didn't
have
that
permit,
there
would
be
no
opportunity
to
provide
against
the
overlapping
parades
and
it
wouldn't
be
no
opportunity
to
prevent
violence
and/or
disorder
which
would
result
from
possible
situations
of
good
result.
and
of
course,
in
this
instance,
there
was
an
explosive
situation
in
the
city
of
birmingham
at
the
time
and
the
police
department
was
in
--
was
put
hard
put
to
it
to
try
to
keep
the
situation
from
developing
into
a
very,
very
serious
situation.
i
believe
that
my
time
has
ran
out.
mr.
earl
mcbee
may
i
say
this
though,
may
it
please
the
court,
since
i
was
here
before
i
would
accumulate
a
little
tremor
here
and
some
impediment
of
speech
with
which
i
apologize.
mr.
earl
mcbee
mr.
justice
black
and
may
it
please
the
court.
some
18
months
ago,
i
believe,
i
was
--
had
the
privilege
of
appearing
before
this
court
in
reference
to
the
case
of
walker
versus
the
city
of
birmingham
which
we
think
is
a
closely
related
case
in
as
much
as
it
deals
with
the
identical
parade
and
of
course
it
deals
with
and
involves
the
same
parties,
that
is
to
say
the
city
of
birmingham
and
in
this
instance
the
respondent
rather
petitioner
f.l.
shuttlesworth.
we
think
that
the
facts
in
that
case
should
be
considered
in
this
case
because
they
are
related
and
as
least
we
believe
that
the
court
has
authority
to
so
consider.
we
would
like
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
the
city
of
birmingham
at
the
time
this
particular
litigation
began,
there
had
been
a
number
of
mass
parades
and
lead
again
to
the
balance
and
attacks
the
police
department
city
of
birmingham
to
protect
the
demonstrators
and
also
to
protect
the
citizens
of
the
city
of
birmingham.
on
the
evening
of,
the
10th
of
november
--
10th
of
april,
the
city
acquired
and
injunction
from
the
state
court
enjoying
the
holding
of
mass
parades
in
violation
of
1159,
that's
answer
the
question.
the
reaction
to
that
injunction
was
an
immediate
denial
of
any
right
of
the
state
or
any
intent
of
the
parties
involving
the
petitioner
to
pay
any
attention
to
the
injunction
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
said
that
the
injunction
was
not
to
be
respected
or
not
to
obeyed
but
they
did
not
believe
in
obeying
laws
that
they
consider
to
be
opposed
to
there
way
of
lying.
mr.
earl
mcbee
no,
sir.
(voice
overlap)
i
don't
mean
to
be
doing
that
but
i
just
mean
to
attract
to
connect
the
two
cases
in
this
respect
that
there
was
an
effort
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner
here
to
say
that
he
had
been
mistreated
and
misled
into
the
arrest
on
this
occasion
and
we
believe
that
the
facts
in
the
walker
case
are
at
least
to
some
extent
relevant.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
we
agree
that
it
is
not
an
issue
in
the
case
but
we
believe,
thought
at
least
that
the
factual
situation
was
relevant.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir,
that's
true.
mr.
earl
mcbee
i
believe
that's
correct
that
there's
no
question
of
any
mess
conduct
on
the
part
of
this
particular
defendants
in
the
sense
of
any
disorderly
conduct.
and
it
won
in
that
case
either
but
they
did
say
that
they
were
going
to
disobey
the
law.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes,
sir.
and
the
facts
in
the
case
in
this
particular
instance,
there's
no
question
about
that
the
evidence
clearly
shows
the
violation
of
the
law.
now,
the
question
of
the
precedent
before
the
court
in
which
the
court
must
consider
as
we
believe
in
determining
the
rightfulness
or
the
wrongfulness
of
the
conviction
in
this
case
will
be
among
other
things
of
course
the
cox
case,
that's
new
hampshire-cox
case.
now,
the
new
hampshire-cox
case
did
not
place
any
sort
of
restriction
upon
the
issuance
of
the
license.
the
license
was
particularly
and
fully
and
completely
based
upon
a
monetary
consideration
plus
whatever
construe,
whatever
restrictions
they
--
might
decide
it
want
to
put
into
it.
for
example,
they
could
if
they
wanted
to
use
racial
lines
or
for
denying
the
application.
they
could
use
with
each
lines
to
deny
their
application.
they
could
also
presumably
use
any
other
criteria
for
the
denying
the
application.
in
considering
the
question,
and
we
don't
believe
that
the
ordinance
in
1159
is
any
more
void
and
invalid
than
is
the
ordinance
in
the
case
of
cox
because
of
the
fact
that
there
was
reference
to
some
action
on
the
part
of
the
court
in
connection
of
the
city
commission
in
connection
with
the
various
assets
--
the
various
aspects
of
the
police
power
of
the
city.
in
other
words,
it
does
relate
to
specifically
aspects
of
the
police
power.
now,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
in
each
ruling
which
by
the
way
followed
the
ruling
of
this
court
in
the
case
of
walker
versus
--
the
city
of
birmingham
versus
walker
did
hold
in
line
with
that
case
that
the
ordinance
was
not
unconstitutional.
now,
there's
been
a
question
raised
as
to
why
this
court
of
alabama
waived
so
long.
i
have
a
strong
suspicion
that
probably
they
were
waiting
until
the
court,
this
court
made
this
decision
in
the
walker
case.
and
the
court
in
this
case
in
the
walker
case
was
dealing
with
the
particular
ordinance
in
question
and
of
course
was
certainly
expected
and
anticipated
they
would
gear
some
guidelines
for
the
alabama
court
to
follow.
i
think
that
there
is
some
misapprehension,
at
least
in
the
argument
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case
as
to
the
significance
of
the
two
lines
of
cases.
now,
we
certainly
reflect
and
know
that
there
are
some
admissible
regulations
that
can
be
used
in
connection
with
parades
and
other
types
of
actions
upon
the
streets
of
the
cities.
but
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
also
in
the
connection
with
the
regular
pure
speech
cases,
a
less
privilege
on
the
part
of
the
local
government
governing
bodies
to
present
and
to
enforce
regulations
which
restrict
or
do
impair
the
right
of
the
demonstrators
or
the
people
using
free
speech.
in
the
cox
case,
the
court
made
it
clear
that
there
is
a
difference
in
the
use
of
public
streets
and
in
pure
speech.
if
a
municipality
has
authority
to
control
the
use
of
the
public
streets
for
parades
or
processions
as
on
the
others,
it
cannot
be
denied
authority
to
give
consideration
without
unfair
discrimination,
time,
place
and
manner
in
relation
to
the
other
proper
uses
of
the
streets.
we
find
the
impossible
to
say
the
limited
authority
conferred
by
the
licensing
provisions
of
statutes
in
question
as
thus
construed
by
the
state
court
contravened
any
constitutional
right
that
must
be
borne
in
mind
please
that
this
statute
was
construed
just
as
in
our
case
in
a
conviction
situation
involving
cox.
and
it
was
construed
post
the
act
of
--
for
which
he
was
convicted
that
is
after
which
he
was
convicted.
the
conviction
was
upheld
and
we
think
in
line
with
other
decisions
of
this
honorable
court
for
the
reason
that
when
he
violated
the
ordinance,
he
did
so
with
the
fact
that
it
was
conceivable
that
a
valid
construction
could
be
placed
upon
the
ordinance
which
would
render
it
valid
and
which
would
render
it
constitutional
and
he
then
did
at
his
peril
violate
the
particular
constitutional
that
is
particular
as
it
could
be
made
about
it
by
the
construction
of
the
courts.
we've
come
on
to
the
walker
case
and
of
course
i
think
mr.
greenberg
refers
to
the
fact
that
lovell
and
staub
and
freedman,
the
doctrine
of
those
cases
are
at
odds
with
the
holding
of
the
court
in
alabama
court
in
this
case.
but
however,
in
the
walker
case,
we
find
the
reference
to
cox
versus
louisiana
in
which
the
court
said
that
we
emphatically
reject
the
notion
that
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
before
the
same
kind
of
freedom,
those
who
have
communicate
ideas
by
conduct
such
as
patrolling,
marching,
and
picketing
on
streets
and
highways
as
these
amendments
afford
to
those
who
communicate
ideas
by
pure
speech.
and
at
another
point
in
while
he
walks
a
case
the
court
said
the
authority
of
a
municipality
to
impose
regulations
in
order
to
assure
safety
and
convenience
to
people
and
the
use
of
public
and
highways
has
never
been
regard
as
inconsistent
with
several
liberties
but
rather
as
one
of
the
means
of
safeguarding
is
good
order
in
which
there
are
defend.
and
then,
going
on
over
to
the
question
of
this
particular
ordinance,
the
generality
of
the
language
contained
the
birmingham
ordinance
upon
which
the
injunction
was
based
will
unquestionably
raised
substantial
constitutional
issue
concerning
some
of
its
provisions
and
the
citation
of
a
number
of
cases.
the
petitioners
however
did
not
even
attempt
to
apply
to
the
alabama
courts
from
authoritative
construction
of
the
ordinance
and
this
we
think
is
very
significant.
had
they
done
so,
those
courts
might
have
given
the
licensing
authority
granting
the
ordinance
in
narrow
and
precise
code
as
did
the
new
hampshire
courts
in
cox
versus
state
of
new
hampshire
and
poulos
versus
new
hampshire.
here
just
as
in
cox
and
poulos,
it
could
not
be
assumed
that
this
ordinance
was
void
on
its
face.
and
then
going
into
question
of
the
application
of
the
ordinance,
the
petitioners
also
claim
they
were
afraid
to
dissipate
the
injunction
because
of
great
ordinance
in
which
it
was
based
had
been
admonished
in
the
past
and
arbitrated
in
the
right
fashion.
these
precedents
and
that
is
to
say
the
(inaudible)
and
other
precedents
clearly
put
the
petitioner
unnoticed
they
could
not
bypass
all
the
judicial
review
and
claim
that
they
were
entrap
or
misled
as
wholly
and
founded.
a
conclusion
confirmed
by
evidence
of
the
record
showing
that
when
they
petitioner
deliberately
violate
the
injunction,
they
expect
to
go
to
jail.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
we
think
that
the
significance
of
that
is
this.
that
the
precedent
of
cox
versus
new
hampshire
was
booked
and
also
poulos
versus
new
hampshire
was
available
to
the
petitioners.
now,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
at
that
time
he
violated
the
injunction
and
violated
the
ordinance
1159
and
this
justice
as
what
(inaudible)
be
a
precedent
which
he
was
informed
of
should
have
known
about
so
these
list
of
decisions
were
known
to
him
or
should
have
known
to
him
and
he
could
not
claim
entrapment
because
he
did
know
about
those
or
should
have
known
about
them.
and
also,
the
evidence
show
that
they
did
--
knew
they
actually
did
with
the
expectation
of
going
to
jail.
now,
so
far
as
cox
versus
new
hampshire
is
concerned,
we
find
that
that
case
has
an
also
poulos
versus
state
of
new
hampshire
has
been
accepted
by
the
courts
with
a
steady
and
an
unbroken
line
and
i
suppose
have
been
cited
maybe
at
least
50,000
times.
there
are
sound
decisions
they
--
coming
on
down
through
of
course
in
1965
of
the
cox
versus
louisiana
and
by
the
way
the
decision
in
the
walker
case
in
1967
and
then
the
most
recent
case
is
amalgamated
food
employees
union
versus
logan
plaza.
and
in
that
case,
mr.
justice
marshall
writing
for
the
court
and
i
believe
there
was
concurring
opinion
and
one
dissent,
says
in
addition,
the
first
--
the
excise
of
first
amendment
rights
may
be
regulated
with
such
exercise
was
unduly
interfered
with
normal
use
of
the
public
property
by
other
members
of
the
public
with
an
equal
right
to
access
to
it.
thus,
it
has
been
held
that
persons
designed
to
parade
along
city
streets
may
be
required
to
secure
a
permit
in
order
that
he
may
an
autonomous
authorities
may
be
able
to
limit
now
and
interference
with
the
use
of
the
sidewalks
by
other
members
of
the
public
by
regulating
the
time,
place,
and
manner
of
the
parade.
now,
of
course
as
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
has
construed
the
1159,
that
is
the
ordinance
can
only
be
applied
in
reference
to
actually
the
good
order
and
the
convenience
and
use
of
the
streets.
the
essential
contention
as
we
understand
it
is
being
made
at
this
time
that
the
ordinance
did
not
give
fair
notice.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
bouie
has
been
referred
to
and
i
believe
lanzetta.
the
bouie
case
involved
a
situation
where
the
facts
showed
an
intent
to
apply
an
ordinance
to
a
factual
situation
that
it
wasn't
space
designed
to
accommodate.
for
instance,
the
ordinance
was
designed
to
prevent
or
rather
to
punish
going
up
on
property
when
you
are
not
to
go
on
it.
it
was
applied
to
a
situation
where
the
(inaudible)
already
own
it
without
the
notice
being
put
up
and
want
to
get
off.
and
of
course,
that
construction
was
not
the
one
that
the
ordinance
on
its
face
show
that
the
possibility
of
then
therefore
the
courts
held
that
it
was
not
fair
notice.
lanzetta
was
a
situation
where
anybody
who
was
a
member
of
a
gang.
but
the
gang
consisted
two
or
more
people
which
of
course
was
too
broad
and
no
one
could
ever
describe
what
a
gang
was
really
and
that
is
know
what
a
gang
was
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
now
in
reference
to
the
question
of
fair
notice
and
the
administrative
procedures,
here
again,
the
court
in
poulos
versus
new
hampshire
had
occasion
to
deal
with
that
particular
and
specific
problem.
in
that
case,
the
ordinance
had
or
rather
statute
had
or
ordinance
whichever
one
it
was,
had
been
construed
by
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire
and
have
been
approved
by
the
court
by
this
court
in
the
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice,
chief
justice
hughes.
the
court
in
the
poulos
case
said
that
that
case
had
been
made
for
a
permit
but
wrongfully
the
licensing
authorities
had
refused
to
grant
the
permit.
and
because
they
had
refused
to
grant
the
permit,
the
defendant
had
proceeded
to
violate
it.
now,
as
he
proceeded
to
go
ahead
and
have
his
speech
of
whatever
it's
going
to
have
without
the
benefit
of
the
permit.
the
question
was
raised
that
in
this
court
that
to
have
put
him
in
that
situation
to
going
into
a
mandamus
proceeding
would
be
expensive,
would
be
difficult
for
him
to
accomplish
and
would
delay
him
in
his
exercise
of
his
freedom
of
speech
and
so
forth.
the
court
rejecting
that
argument
that
is
the
new
hampshire
court
rejecting
the
argument
and
said
that
that
would
not
be
permissible
because
he
had
a
remedy.
he
could
have
gone
into
the
courts
and
enforced
his
right
to
speak.
this
court
considering
that
question
said
that
that's
exactly
correct.
he
could
have
gone
into
court.
he
could
have
presented
his
wrongful
disallowance
of
the
permit
and
not
having
followed
that
procedure
which
the
state
courts
permitted
he
therefore,
was
not
entitled
protection
of
the
constitutional
amendment
that
he
was
relying
upon.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes,
sir?
mr.
earl
mcbee
oh,
no
sir.
no
sir,
they
would
not.
mr.
earl
mcbee
the
ordinance
as
construed
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
that
i
was
trying
to
answer
that
question
in
saying
this
that
there
was,
the
ordinance
does
have
as
construed
refers
to
formal,
actual
precision
type
of
walks.
they
have
the
same
issue
in
the
cox-new
hampshire
case
where
in
that
case
there
were
i
think
three
or
four
or
five
or
six
groups
or
some
10
to
15
walking
in
single
file.
peaceably
there
were
no
question
about
that.
nobody
raised
that
question
but
they
did
walk
in
single
file
and
the
issue
raised
was
whether
or
not
that
amounted
to
a
parade
within
the
meaning
of
the
ordinance.
and
of
course
that
was
a
--
they
held
that
to
be
a
violation
of
the
new
hampshire
statute
ordinance.
now,
in
this
case,
suppose
the
court
said
again,
it
must
be
a
formal
parade
and
of
course
the
reasons
why
we
think
that
a
permit
is
required
for
a
demonstration
or
a
parade
of
this
type
is
simply
this.
that
the
city
or
the
local
governing
body
is
required
by
law
by
this
court
to
provide
safeguarding
procedures
and
police
protection
to
take
care
of
a
possible
disorders
that
might
interfere
with
their
right
to
parade
and
of
course
in
this
instance,
if
they
had
no
permanent
requirement,
they
would
not
know
where
the
parade
was
to
be
or
when
was
it
to
be
or
what
route
was
it
to
take
and
we
have
no
information
as
to
what
to
do
in
providing
the
protection.
mr.
earl
mcbee
i
don't
know
of
any
likelihood
of
anybody
committing
disorder
in
a
crowd
walking
from
one
event
to
another
event.
i
never
have
heard
of
that
but
there
is
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
actually,
i
don't
believe
that
--
now,
of
course
that
the
question
of
the
participation
of
the
body
of
the
so-called
onlookers.
now,
that's
the
question
really
of
i
think
disputed
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
so-called
onlookers.
they
have
recruited
these
people
to
come
and
they
have
assembled
them
in
the
vicinity
of
the
church
and
while
they
only
about
52
came
out
of
the
church
in
the
formal
march
wearing
blue
jeans,
i
believe,
the
numbers
of
the
onlookers
which
came
along
were
took
up
around,
i
think
maybe
a
1000
or
1500
and
they
took
up
the
street
and
also
both
sidewalks.
they
were
blocking
those
sidewalks.
i
mean,
they
were
completely
utilizing
and
completely
in
mass
moving
on
and
preempting
the
use
of
both
sidewalks.
mr.
earl
mcbee
some
of
them
were
but
they
couldn't
catch
them,
not
very
many
of
them.
but
those
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
yes
and
i
think
but
then
those
that
went
peacefully
were
going
to
be
arrested.
that
was
the
part
of
the
procedure.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes,
sir.
they
have
recruited
people
to
be
arrested
and
go
to
jail
that's
what
they
came
there
for.
they
intended
to
do
that.
now,
they
have
purposes
in
mind,
i
suppose
money-raising
was
one
of
the
reasons
they
did
it.
i
wouldn't
of
course
be
certain
about
it
but
i
would
assume
that
that
was
for
other
reasons
of
their
own.
what
they
did,
they
did
recruit
people
to
come
and
to
march
and
to
be
arrested
and
they
were
arrested.
mr.
earl
mcbee
i
think
the
only
case
we've
tried
that
is
to
say
now
that
recorder's
court
trials
they
didn't
take
the
stand
at
all
with
that
call.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well
now,
the
only
thing
is,
may
it
please
the
court,
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
black,
there
was
no
--
this
is
the
only
case
that
has
been
tried
as
far
as
i
know
of
these
cases.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes,
it
went
to
circuit
court.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes,
it
did.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
there
main
objection
was
and
so
far
as
i
know
as
i
recall,
there
was
no
series
objection,
i
mean
series
denial
of
the
fact
that
they
paraded.
certainly,
the
evidence
was
clear
that
they
did.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes,
without
a
permit.
they
made
no
contention
they
ever
have
a
permit.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
that
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
also
have
notice.
they
--
i
think
there
was
some,
statement
made
at
some
point
along
the
line
that
perhaps
because
they
are
on
the
sidewalk
as
opposed
being
in
the
middle
of
the
street
that
they
probably
went
out,
possibly
not
violating
the
ordinance.
but
however
though,
there
was
in
this
city
code
a
section
which
defines
the
meaning
of
street
to
include
sidewalk.
mr.
earl
mcbee
it
had
been
in
all
these
years,
so
there
must
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
judge
katz
either
did
not
know
that
or
had
not
made
an
effort
to
find
out
because
if
it
was,
actually
in
the
law
of
the
city.
mr.
earl
mcbee
of
course,
we
think
this
--
we
think
that
that
court
of
appeals
primarily
was
addressing
itself
to
the
idea
that
it
was
a
street
rather
sidewalk
rather
than
a
street
case.
but
he
did
write
a
very
lengthy
opinion.
(voice
overlap)
and
we
frankly
think
that
he
would
not
have
written
the
opinion
had
he
had
benefited
the
walker
case
in
this
court
for
his
guidance
when
he
wrote
that
opinion.
but
he
did
write
it
very
lengthy
as
we
know.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
i
think
(voice
overlap).
mr.
earl
mcbee
i
think
it
mentioned
the
case
and
said
that,
of
course,
it
could
perhaps
be
construed
to
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
yes,
i
think
it
makes
him
that.
mr.
earl
mcbee
ah
--
we
would
like
to
make
one
more
observation
in
connection
with
the
organized
march
and
that
is
to
say
that
an
organized
march
does
compete
for
the
use
of
the
sidewalks
with
other
use
of
the
sidewalks
on
the
part
of
people
who
have
the
right
to
use
them
and
that's
the
reason
why
an
organized
march
which
is
known
to
be
planned
requires
a
permit.
if
it
didn't
have
that
permit,
there
would
be
no
opportunity
to
provide
against
the
overlapping
parades
and
it
wouldn't
be
no
opportunity
to
prevent
violence
and/or
disorder
which
would
result
from
possible
situations
of
good
result.
and
of
course,
in
this
instance,
there
was
an
explosive
situation
in
the
city
of
birmingham
at
the
time
and
the
police
department
was
in
--
was
put
hard
put
to
it
to
try
to
keep
the
situation
from
developing
into
a
very,
very
serious
situation.
i
believe
that
my
time
has
ran
out.
mr.
earl
mcbee
may
i
say
this
though,
may
it
please
the
court,
since
i
was
here
before
i
would
accumulate
a
little
tremor
here
and
some
impediment
of
speech
with
which
i
apologize.
