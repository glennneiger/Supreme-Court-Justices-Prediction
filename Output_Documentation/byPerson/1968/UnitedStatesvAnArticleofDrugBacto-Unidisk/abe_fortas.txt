justice

mr.
williams,
suppose
these
discs
were
made
so
that
it
was
to
be
applied
to
the
human
body
or
therapeutic
purposes
exactly
the
same
disc
not
to
be
applied
to
the
human
body
or
therapeutic
purposes,
were
that
be
any
doubt
that
it
was
a
drug?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose,
it
were
to
be
applied
to
the
human
body
or
diagnostic
purposes,
that
is
to
say
for
the
purpose
let
us
say
of
finding
out
what
sort
of
microorganism
is
causing
the
difficulty,
is
there
any
doubt
that
that
would
be
a
drug?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
the
question
here
comes
down
to
this
as
i
understand
it.
this
disc
is
applied
not
to
the
human
body,
but
it's
applied
to
a
smear
taken
from
the
agar
plate
from
a
substance
derived
from
the
human
body
and
it's
done
in
the
laboratory
and
the
question
is,
does
that
distinction
remove
it
from
the
category
of
a
drug?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
in
a
sense
it
is
viewed
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
i'm
sorry.
in
a
sense
it
is
used
in
treatment
in
the
sense
that
it
is
used
for
purpose
of
determining
the
antibiotic
to
be
used
in
treatment.
and
in
that
sense,
i
suppose
it's
arguable
in
a
way
that
it
is
used
in
treatment
eventhough
its
one
step
removed.
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
this
sir
if
you
happen
to
know
the
various
substances,
spanes
and
what
not
that
are
used
in
the
laboratory
for
the
purpose
of
--
for
diagnostic
purposes
to
determine
what
the
microorganism
is
or
what
not.
are
those
classified
as
drugs?
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
however,
how
about
something
like
this
if
there
is
such
thing.
let
us
suppose
that
in
the
laboratory,
there
is
used
for
purposes
of
application
to
human
tissue.
let's
say
a
tuberculin
batch
or
what
not.
would
that
be
classified
as
a
drug?
but
i'm
saying
i'm
sure
that
if
there
were
injected
into
the
person
in
the
treatment
of
one
form
of
tuberculosis
or
another,
it
would
be
classified
as
a
drug.
does
the
fact
that
the
substance
is
used
solely
in
the
laboratory
remove
it
from
that
classification?
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
know
of
any
case
is?
i
do
not
happen
to
know
of
the
case,
but
the
line
to
be
drawn
here
is
whether
or
not
it's
used
in
the
treatment
or
diagnosis
of
the
disease.
and
further,
--
justice

fortas
