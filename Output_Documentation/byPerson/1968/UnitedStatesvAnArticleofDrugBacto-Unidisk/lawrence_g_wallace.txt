mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
and
it
is
an
in
rem
seizure
proceeding
brought
by
the
government
against
an
interstate
shipment
of
five
cases
of
antibiotic
sensitivity
discs
bearing
the
trade
name
bacto-unidisk.
counsel
have
asked
the
clerk
to
distribute
a
sample
of
the
seized
article
to
each
member
of
the
court.
the
government's
libel
alleged
that
the
shipment
violated
section
502
(l)
of
the
federal
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act
in
that
the
bacto-unidisk
was
a
drug
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
was
composed
in
part
of
specified
antibiotics
and
was
neither
certified
nor
exempted
from
certification
pursuant
to
section
507
of
the
act.
and
the
amended
answer
by
the
claimant,
difco
laboratories,
the
manufacturer
of
the
bacto-unidisk
admits
that
the
article
is
composed
in
part
of
the
specified
antibiotics
and
has
neither
been
certified
nor
exempted
from
certification.
the
claimant's
denial
that
the
shipment
violated
the
act
was
based
solely
on
the
contention
that
the
antibiotics
certification
requirements
of
the
statute
are
inapplicable
because
the
bacto-unidisk
is
not
a
drug
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
and
the
only
issue
in
this
case
therefore
is
whether
sensitivity
testing
discs
such
as
the
bacto-unidisk
are
drugs
within
the
definition
in
section
201
(g)
of
the
act
which
appears
on
page
2
of
our
brief.
this
issue
arises
because
section
507
of
the
act
imposes
the
batch-testing
certification
requirement
only
on
antibiotic
drugs.
and
these
are
to
find
in
section
507
by
reference
to
the
general
term
of
drug
which
in
turn
is
defined
for
purposes
of
the
entire
act
in
section
201
(g).
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
507
may
appears
on
page
3
of
our
brief;
that
is
the
batch-testing
requirement
for
antibiotic
drugs.
and
in
the
middle
of
page
4,
the
definition
of
antibiotic
drugs
is
in
terms
of
drug
and
that
brings
into
play
the
general
definition
of
drug
in
the
statute
as
a
whole.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
refers
to
production
batches
of
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
each
production
batch
has
to
be
certified
by
taking
a
sample
from
that
production
batch
in
testing
it
to
see
that
it
has
the
proper
characteristics
of
identity,
strength,
potency,
etcetera,
to
assure
its
safety
and
efficacy
of
use,
and
that
has
to
be
done
before
that
production
batch
of
an
antibiotic
drug
can
be
disseminated
for
use.
now,
the
manner
in
which
the
bacto-unidisk
and
similar
products
are
used
in
the
course
of
antibiotic
therapy
is
described
in
the
opinion
and
findings
of
the
district
court
and
in
the
printed
enclosure
which
the
claimant
includes
in
each
carton
of
bacto-unidisk
and
which
appears
in
the
record,
and
to
which
i
shall
refer
later.
the
discs
are
used
in
a
screening
test
which
in
the
words
of
the
district
court
serves
as
a
guide
to
a
medical
doctor
in
his
determination
of
the
choice
of
antibiotic
to
prescribe
for
the
patient.
this
is
accomplished
by
first
drawing
from
the
patient
a
specimen
of
affected
body
fluid
which
contains
the
infecting
microorganism
that
is
causing
his
illness.
typically,
this
specimen
is
then
taken
to
the
hospital
or
other
clinical
laboratory
and
placed
upon
a
culture
medium
in
a
small
glass
dish
so
called
petri
dish
where
it
is
incubated
for
a
period
of
hours
to
assure
that
the
mature
colonies
of
the
principle
infecting
organism
can
be
isolated
from
the
specimen
for
use
in
the
sensitivity
test.
this
so-called
islet
of
the
infecting
microorganism
is
then
applied
upon
a
second
culture
medium
in
another
petri
dish
and
the
dry
paper
sensitivity
discs,
each
of
which
has
been
impregnated
with
a
certain
quantity
of
a
particular
antibiotic
are
placed
upon
the
surface
of
this
freshly
inoculated
culture.
during
the
ensuing
incubation
period
of
6
to
18
hours,
the
antibiotics
disseminate
outward
forming
circular
zones
around
each
of
the
small
impregnated
discs.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
they
cannot
be
bought
until
after
they
have
been
certified.
they
cannot
be
marketed
to
anyone.
and
as
a
practical
matter,
they're
used
only
in
clinical
laboratories.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
correct.
that's
the
way
the
act
is
presently
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
of
course
to
my
knowledge,
they
are
not
now
being
disseminated
and
this
would
be
a
prescription
drug
if
our
position
is
correct
that
they
are
drug
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
of
course,
if
they
are
not
a
drug,
that
would
make
a
difference
in
answering
that
question.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
are
not
intended
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
product
is
intended
for
this
testing
use
in
laboratories
and
not
to
be
ingested
by
individuals
in
anyway.
now,
as
i
say
in
the
test,
the
antibiotics
disseminate
outward
forming
circular
zones
around
each
of
these
small
impregnated
discs
and
then
if
the
infecting
organism
is
sensitive
to
the
antibiotic
on
a
particular
disc,
its
growth
will
be
inhibited
in
the
zone
around
back
disc,
leaving
a
clear
circle,
a
so
called
“zone
of
inhibition”
on
the
medium
in
the
dish
surrounding
that
particular
discs.
but
in
the
zones
around
the
discs
containing
an
antibiotic
to
which
the
microorganism
is
resistant,
the
islet
will
grow
leaving
little
are
no
clear
area.
from
the
presence
or
absence
of
these
zones
of
inhibition
around
the
various
discs,
the
microbiologist
advices
the
physician
which
of
the
antibiotics
appear
to
be
effective
and
which
appear
to
be
ineffective
against
the
infecting
microorganism.
this
report
is
then
used
by
the
physician
as
a
guide
in
selecting
an
antibiotic
for
treatment
of
his
patient's
infection.
and
these
discs
are
quite
widely
used;
this
record
shows
there
is
testimony
that
the
volume
of
discs
sensitivity
testings
is
approximately
5,000
per
month
in
one
chicago
hospital.
it
is
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
are
impregnated
on
each
of
the
small
circular
discs.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
the
manufacture's
laboratories
and
the
manufacture
of
them.
the
discs
as
you
have
it
has
already
impregnated
with
the
various
antibiotics
labeled
around
the
edge
and
with
the
one
sulfur.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
unless
the
discs
are
drugs
and
the
use
in
the
discs
is
the
use
as
a
drug.
otherwise,
there
would
be
no
batch-testing
whatsoever
if
these
antibiotics
required
under
the
statute.
unless,
they
happen
to
commingled
with
antibiotic
powders
that
are
going
to
be
disseminated
for
use
directly
on
patients
in
which
case,
they
would've
been
tested
that
in
that
form.
but
the
batch-testing
requirement
does
require
testing
of
each
form
of
the
antibiotic
as
it's
prepared
for
use
because
of
the
peculiar
scientific
problems
of
change
in
the
antibiotic
from
one
form
to
another.
it
is
clear
then
that
these
discs
contain
antibiotic
substances
which
in
the
words
of
the
statute
are
chemical
substances
which
are
produced
by
a
microorganism
and
which
have
the
capacity
to
inhibit
or
destroy
other
microorganisms.
and
it
is
equally
clear
that
the
use
of
the
sensitivity
discs
in
medical
practice
is
dependent
upon
the
purported
capacity
of
the
antibiotics
impregnated
on
the
discs
to
function
as
antibiotics
to
actually
inhibit
or
destroy
the
growth
of
microorganisms.
in
this
respect,
the
discs
differ
from
medical
books
or
the
petri
dishes
in
the
laboratory
or
other
articles
that
may
also
be
used
as
a
guide
to
therapy.
now,
for
more
than
20
years,
congress
has
recognized
in
section
507
of
the
act
and
in
its
successive
amendments
that
because
of
the
peculiar
scientific
properties
of
these
biologically
produced
antibiotic
drugs,
special
quality
control
of
procedures
must
be
required
to
assure
their
scientific
reliability
or
in
the
words
of
the
statute
to
ensure
their
safety
and
efficacy
of
use.
section
507
therefore,
requires
that
before
it
is
disseminated
each
production
batch
of
antibiotic
drugs
must
be
tested
and
certified
pursuant
to
regulations
promulgated
by
the
secretary
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
to
assure
that
the
drugs
have
such
characteristics
of
identity,
strength,
quality
and
purity
as
to
ensure
their
safety
and
efficacy
of
use.
at
first,
antibiotics
intended
only
for
laboratory
use
in
sensitivity
testing
were
exempted
by
regulation
from
the
batch-testing
requirement.and
that
exemption
applied
to
commercial
sensitivity
discs
such
as
the
bacto-unidisk
which
came
in
to
use
in
the
1950's
as
the
number
of
antibiotics
began
to
proliferate.
the
exemption
of
sensitivity
discs
from
the
certification
requirement
was
terminated
in
a
rule
making
proceeding
in
1960
in
which
regulations
were
adopted
to
require
their
batch
certification.
this
is
discussed
in
our
brief.
the
order
adopting
the
regulations
recited
that
following
numerous
complaints
by
the
medical
profession,
hospitals,
and
laboratory
technicians,
the
food
and
drug
administration
made
an
extensive
survey
of
the
condition
surrounding
the
production
and
marketing
of
discs
and
found
them
unreliable
in
their
statements
of
potency
with
resulted
impairment
of
their
safety
and
efficacy.
it
was
therefore
deem
in
the
words
of
the
order
vital
for
the
protection
of
the
public
health
to
adopt
the
regulations
requiring
their
batch
certification.
the
question
in
this
case
then
is
whether
the
secretary
correctly
interpreted
statute
as
authorizing
the
application
of
the
batch-testing
requirement
to
antibiotic
sensitivity
discs
which
brings
us
back
to
the
interplay
of
definitions
in
the
statute.
the
district
court
was
of
the
view
that
a
literal
reading
of
the
act's
definition
of
drug
on
page
2
of
our
brief
and
particularly
the
language
in
subpart
(b)
of
the
definition,
articles
intended
for
use
in
the
diagnosis
cure
mitigation
treatment
or
prevention
of
disease.
the
district
court
was
of
the
view
that
this
language
clearly
has
application
to
the
sensitivity
discs.
but
despite
this
and
despite
the
fact
that
drugs
are
contained
in
the
article
again
in
the
words
of
the
district
court,
the
district
court
decided
that
the
act
should
not
be
interpreted
as
including
sensitivity
discs
as
drugs
because
no
part
of
this
article
is
administered
to
man
or
other
animals
either
internally
or
externally,
and
its
sole
function
is
to
provide
medical
doctors
with
information
for
use
by
them
as
guidelines.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
holding
that
sensitivity
discs
are
not
drugs
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
expressing
the
view
that
the
discs
only
aid
to
physician
to
determine
what
antibiotics
to
use
for
the
cure
mitigation
or
treatment
of
the
patient's
disease
and
in
the
words
of
the
court
that
it
was
not
the
legislative
intent
to
apply
the
phrase
intended
for
use
in
the
cure,
mitigation,
treatment,
etcetera,
in
such
an
indirect
manner.
neither
court
cited
any
legislative
history
in
support
of
its
interpretation
of
the
statutory
definitions.
we
believe
first
that
it
is
clear
on
this
record
and
in
the
district
court's
findings
that
batch-testing
of
antibiotics
sensitivity
discs
serves
the
congressional
purpose
expressed
in
section
507
of
assuring
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
antibiotic
therapy.
the
role
of
the
discs
in
therapy
is
adequately
described
in
the
claimant's
own
printed
enclosure
package
in
the
cartons
of
that
to
bacto-unidisks
which
is
reproduced
in
our
appendix
on
page
182.
we
can
look
at
the
first
paragraph
there.
it
says
that
bacto
sensitivity
discs
and
bacto-unidisk,
only
the
latter
are
involved
here,
are
standardized
to
paper
discs
containing
known
amounts
of
the
more
commonly
employed
antibiotics,
etcetera.
they
are
recommended
as
a
rapid
practical
clinically
accurate
and
inexpensive
means
of
determining
the
relative
sensitivity
of
microorganisms
to
these
therapeutic
agents.
bacto
sensitivity
discs
are
especially
valuable
in
selecting
the
drug
effective
against
chronic
or
persistent
infections,
refract
to
age
of
primary
therapy.
the
testimony
in
the
case
explained
that
the
test
is
medically
important
because
there
are
various
strains
of
the
same
general
group
or
type
of
infecting
organisms
such
as
staphylococcus,
and
there
are
differences
among
these
strains
in
their
sensitivities
and
resistances
to
various
antibiotics.
the
claimant
argues
that
it
is
somehow
significant
that
treatment
with
an
antibiotic
frequently
as
began
before
the
results
of
the
test
are
known,
but
that
does
not
disprove
that
the
discs
play
an
important
role
in
antibiotic
therapy.
the
testimony
unequivocally
shows
consistently
with
the
claimant's
printed
representations
that
as
a
result
of
the
test
with
the
discs,
the
treatment
is
sometimes
switched
from
one
antibiotic
to
another,
and
this
is
particularly
true
in
the
critical
situations
in
which
a
patient
is
not
responding
to
the
primary
therapy.
we've
collected
those
references
on
page
23
of
our
brief.
in
other
factual
consideration
that
it
is
important
to
this
point
in
my
argument
also
is
indicated
in
the
claimant's
printed
enclosure
in
the
bacto-unidisk
this
time
on
page
185
of
the
appendix.
the
little
chart
in
the
middle
of
that
page
shows
that
a
difference
in
the
concentration
or
potency
of
the
antibiotic
on
the
disc
can
make
a
difference
as
to
whether
a
zone
of
inhibition
will
appear
at
all
in
the
test
and
not
merely
a
difference
in
the
size
of
the
zone.
because
of
this,
discrepancies
in
discs
potencies
can
cause
misleading
test
results
and
lead
the
physician
to
proscribe
the
wrong
antibiotic
for
this
patient.
this
was
explained
at
the
trial
in
the
testimony
of
dr.
joseph
turin,
chief
of
the
bacteriology
section
of
the
laboratory
in
henry
ford
hospital
in
detroit
on
page
83
of
your
printed
appendix.
after
complaining
of
the
discrepancy,
his
hospital
had
found
in
discs
prior
to
the
certification
requirement,
dr.
turin
explained
in
the
last
two
paragraphs
on
page
83,
there's
a
possibility
of
having
too
low
of
potency
in
that
discs,
too
low
of
concentration
in
which
case
the
organism
would
tend
to
be
reported
out
as
being
a
resistant
one
or
being
more
resistant
than
if
the
true
potency
were
in
the
discs.
and
on
the
other
hand,
you
might
have
too
high
of
potency
which
means
that
you
would
report
a
sensitive
organism
which
in
fact
might
not
be
in
that
very
sensitive
category.
so,
it
might
be
an
error
in
either
direction
which
would
give
us
false
readings
and
we
would
be
giving
misinformation
to
the
clinician
and
he
in
turn
obviously
being
unaware
of
this
situation
as
we
would
be
would
not
treat
the
patient
properly.
therefore,
we
feel
that
we
can't
take
this
chance
of
using
discs
that
are
not
certified.
it
to
us
is
a
real
hazard.
additional
testimony
to
the
same
effect
to
summarize
on
page
27
of
our
brief,
the
point
is
that
the
whole
legislative
purpose
reflected
in
the
batch-testing
requirement
of
section
507
and
brought
out
in
the
legislative
history
reviewed
in
our
brief.
the
purpose
of
trying
to
assure
that
patients
will
get
the
therapeutic
benefit
intended
when
physicians
prescribe
antibiotic
drugs
for
them
can
be
defeated
regardless
of
how
pure
and
potent
the
pills
capsules
or
injections
administered
to
the
patients
maybe
if
because
of
faulty
discs,
the
wrong
antibiotics
are
administered
to.
we
believe
that
a
proper
respect
for
the
congressional
judgment
requires
that
the
issue
of
interpreting
the
statutory
definitions
in
this
case
be
approached
with
this
background
in
mind.
when
this
consideration
is
combined
with
the
general
principle
that
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act
is
broadly
construed
in
according
to
its
purpose
to
protect
the
public
health,
we
think
it
is
clear
first
that
the
use
of
the
discs
shown
in
this
record
is
a
used
in
the
treatment
of
disease
within
the
meaning
of
the
statutory
definition
of
drug.
the
claimant
argues
that
the
use
of
the
discs
in
the
course
of
the
patient's
treatment
is
too
indirect
to
use
to
be
considered
a
use
in
the
treatment
of
disease
within
the
statutory
definition.
but
this
would
mean
that
the
discs
are
neither
drugs
nor
devices
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
since
the
definition
of
device
used
as
precisely
the
same
statutory
language.
and
since
the
act's
protections
against
adulteration
or
misbranding
apply
only
to
drugs
and
devices,
the
result
would
be
that
the
public
would
be
utterly
unprotected
against
any
kind
of
mislabeling
or
adulteration
of
the
discs.
there
would
be
no
statutory
recourse
for
example,
even
if
the
discs
were
being
marketed
with
every
antibiotic
on
them
falsely
labeled.
nothing
in
the
statutory
language
or
in
the
legislative
history
requires
a
session
absurd
result
which
would
so
seriously
endanger
the
public
health.
the
more
substantial
interpretive
question
presented
by
this
case
in
our
view
is
the
problem
of
distinguishing
the
statutory
definitions
of
drug
and
device
on
pages
2
and
3
of
our
brief.
their
terms
insofar
as
pertinent
here
are
almost
identical
and
yet
the
two
definitions
are
expressly
mutually
exclusive.
the
district
court
recognized
this
problem
and
undertook
to
solve
it
by
limiting
the
statutory
term
drug
to
what
it
believe
to
be
the
common
medical
usage
of
the
word
drug
outside
the
statute
as
articles
administer
to
man
or
other
animals
either
internally
or
externally.
we
believe
that
this
is
where
the
district
court
went
wrong
because
this
is
inadequate
as
an
approach
to
the
interpretation
of
this
complex
technical
regulatory
scheme
for
the
protection
of
the
public
health
in
which
the
congress
has
provided
its
own
definition
of
the
term
drug
for
the
purposes
of
the
act.
it
is
a
statutory
term
of
art
to
be
interpreted
in
a
manner
to
effectuate
the
objectives
of
the
statute.
in
our
view,
securities
and
exchange
commission
against
ralston
purina
company
in
volume
346
u.s.
is
the
exemplary
opinion
of
this
court
which
illuminates
the
proper
approach
to
interpreting
such
a
provision
of
a
regulatory
statute,
so
as
to
accomplish
the
congressional
purpose.
there,
in
interpreting
the
statutory
exemptions
from
registration
for
a
private
offering
of
stock,
this
court
held
that
because
it
was
the
congressional
purpose
to
exempt
transactions
as
to
which
there
was
no
practical
need
for
the
statute's
application,
the
interpretation
of
the
exemption
should
turn
on
whether
the
particular
class
of
person's
affected
needs
the
protection
of
the
act.
applying
this
standard,
the
court
held
that
the
company's
offering
of
treasury
stock
to
its
key
employees
was
a
public
offering
subject
to
the
provisions
of
the
security's
act
because
in
the
words
of
the
court,
the
employees
had
not
been
shown
to
be
able
to
defend
for
themselves.
the
same
basic
approach
was
recently
taken
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
distinguishing
between
the
definitions
of
drug
and
device
in
the
statute
before
us.
in
the
case
of
amp
incorporated
against
gardner
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
in
which
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
number
86,
this
term.
the
court
there
look
to
the
practical
consequences
in
terms
of
the
act's
differences
in
the
requirements
imposed
upon
drugs
and
devices
to
determine
whether
the
particular
article
there
at
issue
should
be
classified
as
one
or
the
other.
and
the
practical
consequences
of
that
difference
in
classification
are
restricted
to
a
very
few
provisions
of
the
statute.
in
fact,
at
the
beginning
when
the
definition's
first
came
into
the
statute,
there
was
no
difference
in
the
regulation
of
drugs
and
devices
at
all.
in
our
own
case,
the
only
significance
of
the
classification
of
the
discs
as
either
drugs
or
devices
as
if
they
are
classified
as
drugs,
the
batch-testing
requirements
for
antibiotic
drugs
will
apply.
and
otherwise,
they
will
not.
the
scientific
qualities
of
antibiotics
which
led
congress
to
require
batch-testing
are
the
same
whether
the
antibiotic
is
used
for
a
pill
for
a
hypodermic
injection
or
is
a
test
to
determine
what
pill
or
injection
to
administer.
and
as
i
have
said,
the
record
shows
that
the
medical
need
for
assurances
to
quality
and
potency
exist
whether
the
antibiotic
is
used
on
a
disc
or
in
a
pill
or
injection.
and
it
is
therefore
manifest
that
the
secretary
correctly
interpreted
the
act
to
reflect
the
legislative
purpose
in
concluding
that
the
discs
are
drugs
under
section
201
(g)
subject
to
the
batch-testing
requirements
of
section
507.
and
accordingly,
we
ask
that
the
contrary
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
reversed.
if
i
may,
i'll
save
any
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you.
i
want
to
clarify
that
our
position
is
that
under
the
statute,
it
would
be
entirely
for
to
or
this
if
this
disc
is
not
a
drug
whether
or
not
the
powders
put
on
the
disc
were
batch-tested.
the
statute
would
not
require
that
they
be
batch-tested.
but
our
position
goes
beyond
that
we
say
that
regardless
of
whether
those
powders
were
batch-tested,
the
disc
itself
needs
to
be
batch-tested
to
assure
that
the
proper
potency
and
the
proper
amount
of
the
powder
is
impregnated.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don't
believe
i
said
in
fact,
but
we
have
to
assure
that
the
proper
amount
is
on
each
of
these
discs
and
that
it
will
defuse
properly
for
the
test
and
that
the
labeling
is
correct
on
the
disc
that
would
not
be
accomplished
by
batch-testing
of
the
powders
themselves.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
maybe.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
discs
themselves
are
drugs
subject
to
the
batch-testing
requirement;
that
is
correct.
the
paper
and
which
these
antibiotics
are
contained
is
merely
there.
the
container
--
the
paper
placed
no
part
in
the
test.
it's
just
a
convenient
way
of
getting
these
antibiotics
into
the
culture
that
has
been
drawn
from
the
patient.
and
i
think
it
should
be
properly
look
at
that
way.
we
believe
that
it
is
correct
to
interpret
this
statute
functionally
so
as
to
afford
the
public
the
protections
of
the
statute
that
are
scientifically
pertinent
to
the
characteristics
of
the
article
at
issue
and
to
the
medical
use
for
which
it
is
intended.
dr.
turin
himself
while
he
could
not
recall
specific
example
did
recall
that
a
number
of
instances
of
false
result
have
been
brought
to
his
attention
by
individuals
in
the
infectious
disease
department.
but
in
addition,
there
was
no
challenge
made
to
the
record
that
was
developed
in
the
rule
making
proceedings
and
which
the
food
and
drug
administration
determined
on
the
basis
of
complaints
from
laboratories
that
the
discs
had
proved
unreliable
and
that
there
was
a
medical
scientific
need
for
their
batch-testing.
thank
you.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
and
it
is
an
in
rem
seizure
proceeding
brought
by
the
government
against
an
interstate
shipment
of
five
cases
of
antibiotic
sensitivity
discs
bearing
the
trade
name
bacto-unidisk.
counsel
have
asked
the
clerk
to
distribute
a
sample
of
the
seized
article
to
each
member
of
the
court.
the
government's
libel
alleged
that
the
shipment
violated
section
502
(l)
of
the
federal
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act
in
that
the
bacto-unidisk
was
a
drug
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
was
composed
in
part
of
specified
antibiotics
and
was
neither
certified
nor
exempted
from
certification
pursuant
to
section
507
of
the
act.
and
the
amended
answer
by
the
claimant,
difco
laboratories,
the
manufacturer
of
the
bacto-unidisk
admits
that
the
article
is
composed
in
part
of
the
specified
antibiotics
and
has
neither
been
certified
nor
exempted
from
certification.
the
claimant's
denial
that
the
shipment
violated
the
act
was
based
solely
on
the
contention
that
the
antibiotics
certification
requirements
of
the
statute
are
inapplicable
because
the
bacto-unidisk
is
not
a
drug
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
and
the
only
issue
in
this
case
therefore
is
whether
sensitivity
testing
discs
such
as
the
bacto-unidisk
are
drugs
within
the
definition
in
section
201
(g)
of
the
act
which
appears
on
page
2
of
our
brief.
this
issue
arises
because
section
507
of
the
act
imposes
the
batch-testing
certification
requirement
only
on
antibiotic
drugs.
and
these
are
to
find
in
section
507
by
reference
to
the
general
term
of
drug
which
in
turn
is
defined
for
purposes
of
the
entire
act
in
section
201
(g).
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
507
may
appears
on
page
3
of
our
brief;
that
is
the
batch-testing
requirement
for
antibiotic
drugs.
and
in
the
middle
of
page
4,
the
definition
of
antibiotic
drugs
is
in
terms
of
drug
and
that
brings
into
play
the
general
definition
of
drug
in
the
statute
as
a
whole.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
refers
to
production
batches
of
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
each
production
batch
has
to
be
certified
by
taking
a
sample
from
that
production
batch
in
testing
it
to
see
that
it
has
the
proper
characteristics
of
identity,
strength,
potency,
etcetera,
to
assure
its
safety
and
efficacy
of
use,
and
that
has
to
be
done
before
that
production
batch
of
an
antibiotic
drug
can
be
disseminated
for
use.
now,
the
manner
in
which
the
bacto-unidisk
and
similar
products
are
used
in
the
course
of
antibiotic
therapy
is
described
in
the
opinion
and
findings
of
the
district
court
and
in
the
printed
enclosure
which
the
claimant
includes
in
each
carton
of
bacto-unidisk
and
which
appears
in
the
record,
and
to
which
i
shall
refer
later.
the
discs
are
used
in
a
screening
test
which
in
the
words
of
the
district
court
serves
as
a
guide
to
a
medical
doctor
in
his
determination
of
the
choice
of
antibiotic
to
prescribe
for
the
patient.
this
is
accomplished
by
first
drawing
from
the
patient
a
specimen
of
affected
body
fluid
which
contains
the
infecting
microorganism
that
is
causing
his
illness.
typically,
this
specimen
is
then
taken
to
the
hospital
or
other
clinical
laboratory
and
placed
upon
a
culture
medium
in
a
small
glass
dish
so
called
petri
dish
where
it
is
incubated
for
a
period
of
hours
to
assure
that
the
mature
colonies
of
the
principle
infecting
organism
can
be
isolated
from
the
specimen
for
use
in
the
sensitivity
test.
this
so-called
islet
of
the
infecting
microorganism
is
then
applied
upon
a
second
culture
medium
in
another
petri
dish
and
the
dry
paper
sensitivity
discs,
each
of
which
has
been
impregnated
with
a
certain
quantity
of
a
particular
antibiotic
are
placed
upon
the
surface
of
this
freshly
inoculated
culture.
during
the
ensuing
incubation
period
of
6
to
18
hours,
the
antibiotics
disseminate
outward
forming
circular
zones
around
each
of
the
small
impregnated
discs.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
they
cannot
be
bought
until
after
they
have
been
certified.
they
cannot
be
marketed
to
anyone.
and
as
a
practical
matter,
they're
used
only
in
clinical
laboratories.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
correct.
that's
the
way
the
act
is
presently
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
of
course
to
my
knowledge,
they
are
not
now
being
disseminated
and
this
would
be
a
prescription
drug
if
our
position
is
correct
that
they
are
drug
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
of
course,
if
they
are
not
a
drug,
that
would
make
a
difference
in
answering
that
question.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
are
not
intended
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
product
is
intended
for
this
testing
use
in
laboratories
and
not
to
be
ingested
by
individuals
in
anyway.
now,
as
i
say
in
the
test,
the
antibiotics
disseminate
outward
forming
circular
zones
around
each
of
these
small
impregnated
discs
and
then
if
the
infecting
organism
is
sensitive
to
the
antibiotic
on
a
particular
disc,
its
growth
will
be
inhibited
in
the
zone
around
back
disc,
leaving
a
clear
circle,
a
so
called
“zone
of
inhibition”
on
the
medium
in
the
dish
surrounding
that
particular
discs.
but
in
the
zones
around
the
discs
containing
an
antibiotic
to
which
the
microorganism
is
resistant,
the
islet
will
grow
leaving
little
are
no
clear
area.
from
the
presence
or
absence
of
these
zones
of
inhibition
around
the
various
discs,
the
microbiologist
advices
the
physician
which
of
the
antibiotics
appear
to
be
effective
and
which
appear
to
be
ineffective
against
the
infecting
microorganism.
this
report
is
then
used
by
the
physician
as
a
guide
in
selecting
an
antibiotic
for
treatment
of
his
patient's
infection.
and
these
discs
are
quite
widely
used;
this
record
shows
there
is
testimony
that
the
volume
of
discs
sensitivity
testings
is
approximately
5,000
per
month
in
one
chicago
hospital.
it
is
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
are
impregnated
on
each
of
the
small
circular
discs.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
the
manufacture's
laboratories
and
the
manufacture
of
them.
the
discs
as
you
have
it
has
already
impregnated
with
the
various
antibiotics
labeled
around
the
edge
and
with
the
one
sulfur.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
unless
the
discs
are
drugs
and
the
use
in
the
discs
is
the
use
as
a
drug.
otherwise,
there
would
be
no
batch-testing
whatsoever
if
these
antibiotics
required
under
the
statute.
unless,
they
happen
to
commingled
with
antibiotic
powders
that
are
going
to
be
disseminated
for
use
directly
on
patients
in
which
case,
they
would've
been
tested
that
in
that
form.
but
the
batch-testing
requirement
does
require
testing
of
each
form
of
the
antibiotic
as
it's
prepared
for
use
because
of
the
peculiar
scientific
problems
of
change
in
the
antibiotic
from
one
form
to
another.
it
is
clear
then
that
these
discs
contain
antibiotic
substances
which
in
the
words
of
the
statute
are
chemical
substances
which
are
produced
by
a
microorganism
and
which
have
the
capacity
to
inhibit
or
destroy
other
microorganisms.
and
it
is
equally
clear
that
the
use
of
the
sensitivity
discs
in
medical
practice
is
dependent
upon
the
purported
capacity
of
the
antibiotics
impregnated
on
the
discs
to
function
as
antibiotics
to
actually
inhibit
or
destroy
the
growth
of
microorganisms.
in
this
respect,
the
discs
differ
from
medical
books
or
the
petri
dishes
in
the
laboratory
or
other
articles
that
may
also
be
used
as
a
guide
to
therapy.
now,
for
more
than
20
years,
congress
has
recognized
in
section
507
of
the
act
and
in
its
successive
amendments
that
because
of
the
peculiar
scientific
properties
of
these
biologically
produced
antibiotic
drugs,
special
quality
control
of
procedures
must
be
required
to
assure
their
scientific
reliability
or
in
the
words
of
the
statute
to
ensure
their
safety
and
efficacy
of
use.
section
507
therefore,
requires
that
before
it
is
disseminated
each
production
batch
of
antibiotic
drugs
must
be
tested
and
certified
pursuant
to
regulations
promulgated
by
the
secretary
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
to
assure
that
the
drugs
have
such
characteristics
of
identity,
strength,
quality
and
purity
as
to
ensure
their
safety
and
efficacy
of
use.
at
first,
antibiotics
intended
only
for
laboratory
use
in
sensitivity
testing
were
exempted
by
regulation
from
the
batch-testing
requirement.and
that
exemption
applied
to
commercial
sensitivity
discs
such
as
the
bacto-unidisk
which
came
in
to
use
in
the
1950's
as
the
number
of
antibiotics
began
to
proliferate.
the
exemption
of
sensitivity
discs
from
the
certification
requirement
was
terminated
in
a
rule
making
proceeding
in
1960
in
which
regulations
were
adopted
to
require
their
batch
certification.
this
is
discussed
in
our
brief.
the
order
adopting
the
regulations
recited
that
following
numerous
complaints
by
the
medical
profession,
hospitals,
and
laboratory
technicians,
the
food
and
drug
administration
made
an
extensive
survey
of
the
condition
surrounding
the
production
and
marketing
of
discs
and
found
them
unreliable
in
their
statements
of
potency
with
resulted
impairment
of
their
safety
and
efficacy.
it
was
therefore
deem
in
the
words
of
the
order
vital
for
the
protection
of
the
public
health
to
adopt
the
regulations
requiring
their
batch
certification.
the
question
in
this
case
then
is
whether
the
secretary
correctly
interpreted
statute
as
authorizing
the
application
of
the
batch-testing
requirement
to
antibiotic
sensitivity
discs
which
brings
us
back
to
the
interplay
of
definitions
in
the
statute.
the
district
court
was
of
the
view
that
a
literal
reading
of
the
act's
definition
of
drug
on
page
2
of
our
brief
and
particularly
the
language
in
subpart
(b)
of
the
definition,
articles
intended
for
use
in
the
diagnosis
cure
mitigation
treatment
or
prevention
of
disease.
the
district
court
was
of
the
view
that
this
language
clearly
has
application
to
the
sensitivity
discs.
but
despite
this
and
despite
the
fact
that
drugs
are
contained
in
the
article
again
in
the
words
of
the
district
court,
the
district
court
decided
that
the
act
should
not
be
interpreted
as
including
sensitivity
discs
as
drugs
because
no
part
of
this
article
is
administered
to
man
or
other
animals
either
internally
or
externally,
and
its
sole
function
is
to
provide
medical
doctors
with
information
for
use
by
them
as
guidelines.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
holding
that
sensitivity
discs
are
not
drugs
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
expressing
the
view
that
the
discs
only
aid
to
physician
to
determine
what
antibiotics
to
use
for
the
cure
mitigation
or
treatment
of
the
patient's
disease
and
in
the
words
of
the
court
that
it
was
not
the
legislative
intent
to
apply
the
phrase
intended
for
use
in
the
cure,
mitigation,
treatment,
etcetera,
in
such
an
indirect
manner.
neither
court
cited
any
legislative
history
in
support
of
its
interpretation
of
the
statutory
definitions.
we
believe
first
that
it
is
clear
on
this
record
and
in
the
district
court's
findings
that
batch-testing
of
antibiotics
sensitivity
discs
serves
the
congressional
purpose
expressed
in
section
507
of
assuring
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
antibiotic
therapy.
the
role
of
the
discs
in
therapy
is
adequately
described
in
the
claimant's
own
printed
enclosure
package
in
the
cartons
of
that
to
bacto-unidisks
which
is
reproduced
in
our
appendix
on
page
182.
we
can
look
at
the
first
paragraph
there.
it
says
that
bacto
sensitivity
discs
and
bacto-unidisk,
only
the
latter
are
involved
here,
are
standardized
to
paper
discs
containing
known
amounts
of
the
more
commonly
employed
antibiotics,
etcetera.
they
are
recommended
as
a
rapid
practical
clinically
accurate
and
inexpensive
means
of
determining
the
relative
sensitivity
of
microorganisms
to
these
therapeutic
agents.
bacto
sensitivity
discs
are
especially
valuable
in
selecting
the
drug
effective
against
chronic
or
persistent
infections,
refract
to
age
of
primary
therapy.
the
testimony
in
the
case
explained
that
the
test
is
medically
important
because
there
are
various
strains
of
the
same
general
group
or
type
of
infecting
organisms
such
as
staphylococcus,
and
there
are
differences
among
these
strains
in
their
sensitivities
and
resistances
to
various
antibiotics.
the
claimant
argues
that
it
is
somehow
significant
that
treatment
with
an
antibiotic
frequently
as
began
before
the
results
of
the
test
are
known,
but
that
does
not
disprove
that
the
discs
play
an
important
role
in
antibiotic
therapy.
the
testimony
unequivocally
shows
consistently
with
the
claimant's
printed
representations
that
as
a
result
of
the
test
with
the
discs,
the
treatment
is
sometimes
switched
from
one
antibiotic
to
another,
and
this
is
particularly
true
in
the
critical
situations
in
which
a
patient
is
not
responding
to
the
primary
therapy.
we've
collected
those
references
on
page
23
of
our
brief.
in
other
factual
consideration
that
it
is
important
to
this
point
in
my
argument
also
is
indicated
in
the
claimant's
printed
enclosure
in
the
bacto-unidisk
this
time
on
page
185
of
the
appendix.
the
little
chart
in
the
middle
of
that
page
shows
that
a
difference
in
the
concentration
or
potency
of
the
antibiotic
on
the
disc
can
make
a
difference
as
to
whether
a
zone
of
inhibition
will
appear
at
all
in
the
test
and
not
merely
a
difference
in
the
size
of
the
zone.
because
of
this,
discrepancies
in
discs
potencies
can
cause
misleading
test
results
and
lead
the
physician
to
proscribe
the
wrong
antibiotic
for
this
patient.
this
was
explained
at
the
trial
in
the
testimony
of
dr.
joseph
turin,
chief
of
the
bacteriology
section
of
the
laboratory
in
henry
ford
hospital
in
detroit
on
page
83
of
your
printed
appendix.
after
complaining
of
the
discrepancy,
his
hospital
had
found
in
discs
prior
to
the
certification
requirement,
dr.
turin
explained
in
the
last
two
paragraphs
on
page
83,
there's
a
possibility
of
having
too
low
of
potency
in
that
discs,
too
low
of
concentration
in
which
case
the
organism
would
tend
to
be
reported
out
as
being
a
resistant
one
or
being
more
resistant
than
if
the
true
potency
were
in
the
discs.
and
on
the
other
hand,
you
might
have
too
high
of
potency
which
means
that
you
would
report
a
sensitive
organism
which
in
fact
might
not
be
in
that
very
sensitive
category.
so,
it
might
be
an
error
in
either
direction
which
would
give
us
false
readings
and
we
would
be
giving
misinformation
to
the
clinician
and
he
in
turn
obviously
being
unaware
of
this
situation
as
we
would
be
would
not
treat
the
patient
properly.
therefore,
we
feel
that
we
can't
take
this
chance
of
using
discs
that
are
not
certified.
it
to
us
is
a
real
hazard.
additional
testimony
to
the
same
effect
to
summarize
on
page
27
of
our
brief,
the
point
is
that
the
whole
legislative
purpose
reflected
in
the
batch-testing
requirement
of
section
507
and
brought
out
in
the
legislative
history
reviewed
in
our
brief.
the
purpose
of
trying
to
assure
that
patients
will
get
the
therapeutic
benefit
intended
when
physicians
prescribe
antibiotic
drugs
for
them
can
be
defeated
regardless
of
how
pure
and
potent
the
pills
capsules
or
injections
administered
to
the
patients
maybe
if
because
of
faulty
discs,
the
wrong
antibiotics
are
administered
to.
we
believe
that
a
proper
respect
for
the
congressional
judgment
requires
that
the
issue
of
interpreting
the
statutory
definitions
in
this
case
be
approached
with
this
background
in
mind.
when
this
consideration
is
combined
with
the
general
principle
that
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act
is
broadly
construed
in
according
to
its
purpose
to
protect
the
public
health,
we
think
it
is
clear
first
that
the
use
of
the
discs
shown
in
this
record
is
a
used
in
the
treatment
of
disease
within
the
meaning
of
the
statutory
definition
of
drug.
the
claimant
argues
that
the
use
of
the
discs
in
the
course
of
the
patient's
treatment
is
too
indirect
to
use
to
be
considered
a
use
in
the
treatment
of
disease
within
the
statutory
definition.
but
this
would
mean
that
the
discs
are
neither
drugs
nor
devices
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
since
the
definition
of
device
used
as
precisely
the
same
statutory
language.
and
since
the
act's
protections
against
adulteration
or
misbranding
apply
only
to
drugs
and
devices,
the
result
would
be
that
the
public
would
be
utterly
unprotected
against
any
kind
of
mislabeling
or
adulteration
of
the
discs.
there
would
be
no
statutory
recourse
for
example,
even
if
the
discs
were
being
marketed
with
every
antibiotic
on
them
falsely
labeled.
nothing
in
the
statutory
language
or
in
the
legislative
history
requires
a
session
absurd
result
which
would
so
seriously
endanger
the
public
health.
the
more
substantial
interpretive
question
presented
by
this
case
in
our
view
is
the
problem
of
distinguishing
the
statutory
definitions
of
drug
and
device
on
pages
2
and
3
of
our
brief.
their
terms
insofar
as
pertinent
here
are
almost
identical
and
yet
the
two
definitions
are
expressly
mutually
exclusive.
the
district
court
recognized
this
problem
and
undertook
to
solve
it
by
limiting
the
statutory
term
drug
to
what
it
believe
to
be
the
common
medical
usage
of
the
word
drug
outside
the
statute
as
articles
administer
to
man
or
other
animals
either
internally
or
externally.
we
believe
that
this
is
where
the
district
court
went
wrong
because
this
is
inadequate
as
an
approach
to
the
interpretation
of
this
complex
technical
regulatory
scheme
for
the
protection
of
the
public
health
in
which
the
congress
has
provided
its
own
definition
of
the
term
drug
for
the
purposes
of
the
act.
it
is
a
statutory
term
of
art
to
be
interpreted
in
a
manner
to
effectuate
the
objectives
of
the
statute.
in
our
view,
securities
and
exchange
commission
against
ralston
purina
company
in
volume
346
u.s.
is
the
exemplary
opinion
of
this
court
which
illuminates
the
proper
approach
to
interpreting
such
a
provision
of
a
regulatory
statute,
so
as
to
accomplish
the
congressional
purpose.
there,
in
interpreting
the
statutory
exemptions
from
registration
for
a
private
offering
of
stock,
this
court
held
that
because
it
was
the
congressional
purpose
to
exempt
transactions
as
to
which
there
was
no
practical
need
for
the
statute's
application,
the
interpretation
of
the
exemption
should
turn
on
whether
the
particular
class
of
person's
affected
needs
the
protection
of
the
act.
applying
this
standard,
the
court
held
that
the
company's
offering
of
treasury
stock
to
its
key
employees
was
a
public
offering
subject
to
the
provisions
of
the
security's
act
because
in
the
words
of
the
court,
the
employees
had
not
been
shown
to
be
able
to
defend
for
themselves.
the
same
basic
approach
was
recently
taken
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
distinguishing
between
the
definitions
of
drug
and
device
in
the
statute
before
us.
in
the
case
of
amp
incorporated
against
gardner
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
in
which
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
number
86,
this
term.
the
court
there
look
to
the
practical
consequences
in
terms
of
the
act's
differences
in
the
requirements
imposed
upon
drugs
and
devices
to
determine
whether
the
particular
article
there
at
issue
should
be
classified
as
one
or
the
other.
and
the
practical
consequences
of
that
difference
in
classification
are
restricted
to
a
very
few
provisions
of
the
statute.
in
fact,
at
the
beginning
when
the
definition's
first
came
into
the
statute,
there
was
no
difference
in
the
regulation
of
drugs
and
devices
at
all.
in
our
own
case,
the
only
significance
of
the
classification
of
the
discs
as
either
drugs
or
devices
as
if
they
are
classified
as
drugs,
the
batch-testing
requirements
for
antibiotic
drugs
will
apply.
and
otherwise,
they
will
not.
the
scientific
qualities
of
antibiotics
which
led
congress
to
require
batch-testing
are
the
same
whether
the
antibiotic
is
used
for
a
pill
for
a
hypodermic
injection
or
is
a
test
to
determine
what
pill
or
injection
to
administer.
and
as
i
have
said,
the
record
shows
that
the
medical
need
for
assurances
to
quality
and
potency
exist
whether
the
antibiotic
is
used
on
a
disc
or
in
a
pill
or
injection.
and
it
is
therefore
manifest
that
the
secretary
correctly
interpreted
the
act
to
reflect
the
legislative
purpose
in
concluding
that
the
discs
are
drugs
under
section
201
(g)
subject
to
the
batch-testing
requirements
of
section
507.
and
accordingly,
we
ask
that
the
contrary
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
reversed.
if
i
may,
i'll
save
any
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you.
i
want
to
clarify
that
our
position
is
that
under
the
statute,
it
would
be
entirely
for
to
or
this
if
this
disc
is
not
a
drug
whether
or
not
the
powders
put
on
the
disc
were
batch-tested.
the
statute
would
not
require
that
they
be
batch-tested.
but
our
position
goes
beyond
that
we
say
that
regardless
of
whether
those
powders
were
batch-tested,
the
disc
itself
needs
to
be
batch-tested
to
assure
that
the
proper
potency
and
the
proper
amount
of
the
powder
is
impregnated.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don't
believe
i
said
in
fact,
but
we
have
to
assure
that
the
proper
amount
is
on
each
of
these
discs
and
that
it
will
defuse
properly
for
the
test
and
that
the
labeling
is
correct
on
the
disc
that
would
not
be
accomplished
by
batch-testing
of
the
powders
themselves.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
maybe.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
discs
themselves
are
drugs
subject
to
the
batch-testing
requirement;
that
is
correct.
the
paper
and
which
these
antibiotics
are
contained
is
merely
there.
the
container
--
the
paper
placed
no
part
in
the
test.
it's
just
a
convenient
way
of
getting
these
antibiotics
into
the
culture
that
has
been
drawn
from
the
patient.
and
i
think
it
should
be
properly
look
at
that
way.
we
believe
that
it
is
correct
to
interpret
this
statute
functionally
so
as
to
afford
the
public
the
protections
of
the
statute
that
are
scientifically
pertinent
to
the
characteristics
of
the
article
at
issue
and
to
the
medical
use
for
which
it
is
intended.
dr.
turin
himself
while
he
could
not
recall
specific
example
did
recall
that
a
number
of
instances
of
false
result
have
been
brought
to
his
attention
by
individuals
in
the
infectious
disease
department.
but
in
addition,
there
was
no
challenge
made
to
the
record
that
was
developed
in
the
rule
making
proceedings
and
which
the
food
and
drug
administration
determined
on
the
basis
of
complaints
from
laboratories
that
the
discs
had
proved
unreliable
and
that
there
was
a
medical
scientific
need
for
their
batch-testing.
thank
you.
