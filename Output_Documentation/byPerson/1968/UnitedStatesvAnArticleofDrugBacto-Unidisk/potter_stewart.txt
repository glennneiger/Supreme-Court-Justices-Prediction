not
by

individual

justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
what
the
law
is,
that's
what
the
product
is,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
the
only
market
for
the
manufacturer
of
the
antibiotics
were
the
maker
of
this
unidisk,
then
as
i
understand
that
507
would
not
require
batch-testing?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
a
complicated
question,
and
perhaps
i
haven't
thought.
if
--
i
understand
that
the
maker
of
this
product
here
in
issue
is
not
the
manufacturer
of
these
various
antibiotics
but
gets
them
from
somewhere
else.
justice

from
another
manufacturer.
now,
if
this
for
the
only
customer
of
that
manufacturer,
then
there
would
be
no
batch-testing
required
of
that
manufacturer
under
507,
is
that
right?
justice

the
manufacturer
of
antibiotics,
it
sells
only
to
the
makers
of
discs.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
no,
no,
as
i
understand,
if
they
consider
this
a
drug?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
think
your
answer
make
accepts
you
start
it
to
say
that
you
answer
to
another
question,
whether
or
not
these
had
already
been
batch-tested
before
they
were
sold
to
the
maker
of
the
unidisk
and
you
said,
well,
you
thought
maybe
or
maybe
not
because
probably
a
manufacturer
would
not
differentiated
his
various
antibiotics
depending
upon
to
whom
he
was
going
to
sell
them.
justice
