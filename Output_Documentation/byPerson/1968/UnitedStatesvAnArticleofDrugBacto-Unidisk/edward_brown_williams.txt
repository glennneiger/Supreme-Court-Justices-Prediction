mr.
edward
brown
williams
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
chief
effort
of
the
government
in
its
brief
in
this
matter
and
in
its
argument
has
been
to
create
the
impression
that
all
or
most
antibiotic
therapy
in
the
united
states
is
based
on
the
sensitivity
disc
test
of
which
we
are
talking
here
today,
and
that
unless
this
procedure,
this
testing
procedure
is
controlled
by
the
government
through
certification
of
these
discs
that
the
public
health
will
be
endangered,
patient's
lives
will
be
in
jeopardy.
i
should
come
back
to
that,
we
shall
show
you
can
establish
very
simply
that
on
the
basis
of
the
literature
cited
by
the
government
itself
and
on
the
basis
of
the
testimony
at
the
trial
and
the
judge's
findings
in
the
district
court
that
these
efforts
of
the
government
simply
do
not
hold
water.
they
won't
stand
up.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
i
mean
that
there
is
no
danger
and
i
mean
that
the
extent
of
antibiotic
of
the
basing
of
antibiotic
therapy
upon
the
disc
test
is
far
more
limited
than
the
government
would
have
us
believe.
in
fact,
i
might
say
right
here
since
the
question
has
arisen
that
in
our
brief,
page
18,
we
refer
to
the
figures
of
the
medical
market
guide
which
show
that
in
1967,
77%
of
the
antibiotic
sold
in
that
year
were
purchased
on
prescription
or
on,
or
by
a
physicians.
now,
it
is
obvious
that
only
about
23%
went
to
hospitals,
which
is
the
government
concedes
are
the
place
where
these
tests
are
made
in
the
hospital
laboratories.
as
dr.
keefer,
a
witness
at
the
trial
said,
“i
would
say
from
the
total
number
of
infections
that
doctor
see
and
treat,
the
sensitivity
test
is
not
used.”
it
is
not
used
for
routine.
there's
a
good
reason;
that
is
that
the
initial
therapy
with
a
wide-
spectrum
antibiotic
which
the
doctor
starts
before
the
test
is
ever
began,
it
takes
24
to
36
hours
for
the
test,
is
ordinarily
successful
because
of
the
doctor's
experience
and
the
information
he
is
able
to
draw
from
other
sources.
it
is
after
the
fact
that
he
looks
at
the
test
and
as
dr.
keefer
stated
and
the
court
found,
the
test
is
used
to
confirm
his
judgment.
now,
i
should
like
to
make
a
few
remarks
if
i
may
about
some
of
the
statements
made
by
my
friend
here.
there
was
a
trial
in
the
district
court
which
lasted
i
believe
three
days.
there
were
a
quite
a
number
of
distinguished
witnesses.
they
knew
what
they
were
talking
about
at
least
most
of
them
did.
the
findings
were
made.
they've
been
almost
ignored
by
the
government
in
this
case.
they
are
not
clearly
erroneous.
there's
no
question
about
that
and
there's
been
no
contention
as
the
equivocally
arise.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
i
think
they
have
to
be
in
order
to
be
reversed.
i
think
that's
clear
from
your
decisions.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
i'm
talking
about
the
finding,
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
no
sir,
it
is
not
all
the
factual
question.
now,
on
the
question
of
the
application
of
section
507,
the
batch-testing
provision
of
the
act,
this
doesn't
look
like
the
sort
of
things
which
lends
itself
to
description
as
a
part
of
a
batch.
to
me,
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
a
part
of
a
batch
which
is
to
be
tested
by
the
government,
the
term
“batch”
to
me
mr.
chief
justice
set
and
it
mean
something
with
some
homogenetic
to
it,
and
here
we
have
a
whole
different,
an
entirely
different
sort
of
an
article.
here
are
eight
different
antibiotic
substances
on
this
article.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
yes
sir,
they
came
from
a
batch
which
was
manufactured
by
a
company
which
manufactures
antibiotics
which
are
tested
by
the
government
on
section
507.
they
have
been
check-tested
i
doubt
not
because
i
can't
conceive
of
a
company
who
manufactures
antibiotics
and
sells
them
for
medicines,
manufacturing
separate
antibiotics
for
use
on
these
discs;
that
just
wouldn't
be
good
business.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
if
the
only
market
was
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
well,
the
government
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
the
government
said
it
would
require
it
because
they
consider
this
a
drug,
and
since
the
antibiotic
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
yes
sir,
but
they
also
would
consider
the
antibiotic
going
into
it
a
drug
because
it
would
be
a
component
of
the
drug
under
the
statute.
that
would
be
the
government's
attitude
as
i
understand
it.
but
they
can
speak
for
themselves
only.
sir?
mr.
edward
brown
williams
i
can't
conceive
that
he
would.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
i
think
they
are
check-tested
by
the
food
and
drug
administration.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
i
can
try
your
honor.
there
are
in
the
sensitivity
testing
procedure
which
is
entirely
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
yes
sir.
in
this
testing
procedure,
which
is
entirely
a
laboratory
operation
never
comes
anywhere
near
the
patient.
there
are
involved,
this
device
here
which
is
called
the
sensitivity
disc
both
has
an
antibiotic
substances
on
it.
a
petri
plate
upon
which
is
deposited
agar
which
is
strict
with
an
islet
from
the
patient.
on
top
of
the
agar,
with
the
islet
in
it
is
placed
this
discs
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
this
is
placed
to
this
disc.
around
the
disc,
if
the
antibiotic
is
sensitive
to
--
if
the
organism
from
the
patient
is
sensitive
to
the
particular
antibiotic
in
contact
with
it,
there
will
be
a
zone
of
inhibition.
if
it
is
not
sensitive
to
it,
there
will
no
zone
of
inhibition.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
sir?
mr.
edward
brown
williams
it's
put
on
an
agar
plate,
glass
or
china
plate
in
the
laboratory.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
it
doesn't.
the
only
thing
it
contacts
is
an
islet
which
is
taken
from
shall
we
say
“urine”
or
sputum
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
--
of
the
human
being;
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
yes.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
the
first
step
is
the
isolation,
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
--
i
think
some
18
hours.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
you
strict
the
agar
on
the
plate
of
dish
--
with
the
islet.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
i'm
not
sure
we
have
never
order
that.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
the
agar
goes
on
the
disc,
they
isolate
from
the
patient
goes
on
the
agar
--
i
mean,
on
the
dish.
they
isolate
from
the
patient
goes
on
the
agar
and
the
disc
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
it's
a
growing
medium,
to
grow
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
--
the
bacteria
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
--
in
the
isolate.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
yes.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
if
the
infection
or
the
infectious
strain
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
--
is
sensitive
to
the
antibiotic,
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
--
there
will
be
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
might
clear
it
up.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
you
don't
know
that
it
would
because
this
is
an
in
vitro-test
and
was
transferred
to
the
body
it
may
act
and
how
to
do
it.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
that
is
what
the
laboratory
technician
may
tell
the
doctor.
he
may
say
that
since
there
a
showing
of
sensitivity
in
vitro
that
you
might
try
this
because
it
maybe
effective
in
vivo.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
it
may
or
may
not.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
well,
i
would
assume
that
they
are
from
batches
which
have
been
tested
by
the
food
and
drug
administration.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
he
did
say
that.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
i
would
assume
differently.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
there's
nothing
in
the
record
on
that
your
honor.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
they
want
to
test
this
disc.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
that
is
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
that
is
the
position.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
that
is
the
position
of
the
government.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
they
claim
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
--
should
be
tested.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
the
government
i
think
they
should
be
tested
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
the
government
thinks
they
should
be
--
the
discs
themselves
should
be
tested
because
they
have
found
that
the
public
health
in
their
mind
will
be
endangered
if
they
are
not
tested.
we
have
seen
no
evidence
whatsoever
of
it
and
let
me
point
this
out
now.
in
six
years
since
this
litigation
began
in
1962
i
believe
or
61',
nobody
has
come
up
with
the
single
instances
of
an
erroneous
result
from
a
test
due
to
a
faulty
disc,
and
in
the
12
years
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
sir?
mr.
edward
brown
williams
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
oh!
other
discs
which
are
being
certified
of
the
disc.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
that
--
i
know
but
i'm
going
to
--
if
you
permit
me
sir.
in
the
12
years
pervious
to
certification,
in
those
years,
nobody
came
up
with
a
single
case
of
an
erroneous
interpretation
of
a
sensitivity
test
due
to
a
faulty
disc.
now,
dr.
turin
as
my
friend
said
at
the
hearing
--
at
the
trial,
stated
the
he
felt
there
was
a
danger
to
public
health
involved.
he
said
that
two
or
three
times,
he
was
asked
on
cross-examination
if
he
had
one
single
instance
to
which
he
could
point
to
show
that
the
public
health
was
involved
here.
he
could
not
point
to
any.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
sir,
it
is
not
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
well,
mr.
justice,
they
have
made
no
--
this
is
not
a
finding
made
by
the
agency
which
is
binding
on
the
courts.
i'm
not
asking
any
second
guessing.
i'm
asking
that
the
evidence
be
look
at.
it
shows
that
there
is
no
such
public
health
problem.
and
furthermore,
the
law
is
such
that
there
is
no
basis
in
my
opinion
for
a
holding
this
article
to
be
anything
other
than
a
drug.
unless,
possibly,
it
were
regarded
as
a
device
because
the
definition
involved
reads
in
terms
of
treatment
of
substances
intended
for
use
in
the
treatment
or
diagnosis
of
diseases.
now,
it's
quite
obvious
that
treatment
means
treatment
of
a
patient
and
nobody
can
maintain
that
with
the
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
well,
diagnosis
was
practically
abandoned
by
the
government
in
the
lower
court
as
a
ground
for
its
position.
they
come
back
to
it
in
the
upper
court,
but
dr.
keefer
made
it
quite
clear
and
he
was
perhaps
i
should
say
the
most
distinguished
witness
at
the
trial,
he
made
it
quite
clear
that
it
cannot
be
a
diagnosis
of
an
infection
without
identification
of
the
organism.
and
obvious
to
the
test
does
not
identify
the
organism.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
they
made
a
legal
conclusion
in
the
proceeding
which
is
been
referred
to
when
the
--
in
the
course
of
which
the
regulations
were
adopted.
they
made
a
legal
conclusion
that
the
disc
where
drugs.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
i
don't
recall
that
they
did.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
but
they
have
built
in
terms
of
diagnosis,
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
so
far
as
i
know,
that
was
not
considered
by
the
agency,
it
didn't
appear
in
the
public
proceeding.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
no
sir
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
well,
i
think
the
government's
point
was
that
the
language
of
the
device
section
and
201
(h)
of
its
statute
and
the
language
of
the
disc
of
the
drug
section
201
(g)
of
the
statute
are
quite
similar
except
in
that
201
(g)
excludes
devices
from
a
definition
of
drug.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
no,
you
would
not
have
batch-testing
but
you
could
have
control
as
we
point
out
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
--
in
our
brief
of
a
different
kind.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
yes.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
yes
sir.
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
control
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
it
isn't
before
the
court
in
my
opinion
sir.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
the
court
below
said
that
if
there
was
anything,
it
was
probably
a
device
because
the
only
difference
between
a
device
and
a
drug
is
that
a
device
is
an
apparatus
or
an
instrument
or
a
contragulants.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
no,
they
rule
it
was
a
drug
thereby
excluding
it
from
the
definition
of
device.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
no
sir,
there
would
be
no
doubt
it
was
drug.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
if
it
were
applied
to
the
human
body
for
diagnostic
purposes?
no
sir.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
yes
sir,
but
i
should
like
to
stress
mr.
justice
that
treatment
of
a
patient
is
the
test
of
whether
this
is
used
in
treatment
and
this
there
is
no
treatment
of
a
patient
by
this
device.
secondly,
it
cannot
be
use
in
diagnosis
because
it
does
not
identify
the
organism.
that
is
perfectly
clear.
you
can't
diagnose
unless
you
know
what
the
organism
is.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
diagnosis
is
recognition
of
disease.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
it
is
used
very
in
a
sense
and
to
determine
the
antibiotic
used
in
treatment
on
the
certain
circumstances.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
no
sir.
there
are
several
hundred,
maybe
thousands
of
laboratory
tools
of
this
nature
which
are
used
in
the
industry
and
in
clinical
laboratories
which
have
never
been
classified
as
drugs.
and
if
this
is
classified
as
a
drug,
i
can
see
no
alternative
to
classifying
all
of
these
other
hundreds
or
thousands
of
articles
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
i
believe
so
under
the
statute
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
i'll
tell
you
why
sir.
they
are
not
drugs
because
under
the
statutes,
it
is
well
establish,
there's
no
doubt
whatsoever
that
an
article
is
not
a
drug
unless
it
is
intended
for
use
in
the
treatment
or
diagnosis
or
prevention
or
cure
of
disease.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
this
is
not.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
no.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
well,
this
drug
could
--
if
this
drug
will
use
to
wash
a
window,
it
certainly
wouldn't
be
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
no
sir,
not
under
the
statute.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
not
under
the
statute.
it
might
be
a
drug
in
some
sense,
but
not
under
the
statute..
mr.
edward
brown
williams
no
sir,
it
is
not
because
it
does
not
identify
the
organism
and
without
identification
of
the
organism,
there
cannot
be
diagnosis.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
that
is
their
contention
and
i
obviously
don't
have
time
to
go
into
my
argument,
but
it
is
quite
clear
from
the
literature
and
from
the
trial
that
there
are
so
many
built-in
protections
against
the
sort
of
thing
the
government
apparently
feared
that
this
is
simply
not
going
to
occur.
the
physician
does
not
rely
principally
upon
this
test
even
if
his
initial
therapy
has
not
been
successful.
a
physician's
lye's
is
principle
--
sir?
mr.
edward
brown
williams
but
what
they
say
does
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
in
my
opinion,
it
isn't
the
case.
and
i
think
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
yes
and
i
asked
dr.
turin
for
some
kind
of
specifics
on
that
point.
he
could
give
me
none.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
after
16
years
mr.
chief
justice,
you
would
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
after
16
years
mr.
chief
justice
i
should
think
that
something
would've
occurred
if
that
were
going
to.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
the
government
through
its
research
has
come
up
with
nothing.that's
demonstrated
in
our
brief.
it
was
demonstrated
at
the
trial,
and
it
will
appear
from
the
literature
cited
by
the
government
itself.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
i
say
that
if
it
is
anything,
it's
a
device.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
no
sir.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
i
say
it's
very
realistically
under
the
statute,
is
neither.
but
if
it's
anything,
it
comes
more
than
here
that
being
an
apparatus
or
an
instrument
than
it
does
to
be
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
that
is
correct.
and
if
it
were
used
for
that,
then
it
would
be
more
likely
to
be
a
device.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
that's
my
position,
yes
sir.
i
would
like
to
conclude
by
saying
that
the
literature
cited
by
the
government
which
is
the
all
the
record
entirely
was
never
even
mentioned
at
the
trial,
shows
clearly
that
if
a
laboratory
as
all
good
laboratories
do
sets
up
the
proper
standards
of
zone
sizes
for
the
various
antibiotics
that
that
laboratory
and
any
other
which
does
that
will
have
no
problem
with
the
zone
sizes
is
which
seem
to
trouble
the
government
so.
that
is
very
clear
from
many
of
the
articles
cited
by
the
government
itself.
that
is
true
regardless
of
whether
there
are
certification
and
it
might
be
added
that
even
under
the
government's
certification
regulations,
the
claim
potency,
that
is
the
potency
claim
on
the
label
of
the
disc
may
vary
from
67%
to
150%
in
the
device
itself
or
the
sensitivity
disc
itself.
in
other
words,
you
can
be
from
67%
to
150%
off
and
still
get
these
discs
certified.
in
fact,
as
between
the
lowest
and
the
highest
disc
being
tested
by
the
government,
you
can
go
as
far
as
250%
off.
now,
that
kind
of
system
is
hardly
conducive
to
the
kind
of
outlaying
a
fear
which
the
government
wants
you.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
chief
effort
of
the
government
in
its
brief
in
this
matter
and
in
its
argument
has
been
to
create
the
impression
that
all
or
most
antibiotic
therapy
in
the
united
states
is
based
on
the
sensitivity
disc
test
of
which
we
are
talking
here
today,
and
that
unless
this
procedure,
this
testing
procedure
is
controlled
by
the
government
through
certification
of
these
discs
that
the
public
health
will
be
endangered,
patient's
lives
will
be
in
jeopardy.
i
should
come
back
to
that,
we
shall
show
you
can
establish
very
simply
that
on
the
basis
of
the
literature
cited
by
the
government
itself
and
on
the
basis
of
the
testimony
at
the
trial
and
the
judge's
findings
in
the
district
court
that
these
efforts
of
the
government
simply
do
not
hold
water.
they
won't
stand
up.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
i
mean
that
there
is
no
danger
and
i
mean
that
the
extent
of
antibiotic
of
the
basing
of
antibiotic
therapy
upon
the
disc
test
is
far
more
limited
than
the
government
would
have
us
believe.
in
fact,
i
might
say
right
here
since
the
question
has
arisen
that
in
our
brief,
page
18,
we
refer
to
the
figures
of
the
medical
market
guide
which
show
that
in
1967,
77%
of
the
antibiotic
sold
in
that
year
were
purchased
on
prescription
or
on,
or
by
a
physicians.
now,
it
is
obvious
that
only
about
23%
went
to
hospitals,
which
is
the
government
concedes
are
the
place
where
these
tests
are
made
in
the
hospital
laboratories.
as
dr.
keefer,
a
witness
at
the
trial
said,
“i
would
say
from
the
total
number
of
infections
that
doctor
see
and
treat,
the
sensitivity
test
is
not
used.”
it
is
not
used
for
routine.
there's
a
good
reason;
that
is
that
the
initial
therapy
with
a
wide-
spectrum
antibiotic
which
the
doctor
starts
before
the
test
is
ever
began,
it
takes
24
to
36
hours
for
the
test,
is
ordinarily
successful
because
of
the
doctor's
experience
and
the
information
he
is
able
to
draw
from
other
sources.
it
is
after
the
fact
that
he
looks
at
the
test
and
as
dr.
keefer
stated
and
the
court
found,
the
test
is
used
to
confirm
his
judgment.
now,
i
should
like
to
make
a
few
remarks
if
i
may
about
some
of
the
statements
made
by
my
friend
here.
there
was
a
trial
in
the
district
court
which
lasted
i
believe
three
days.
there
were
a
quite
a
number
of
distinguished
witnesses.
they
knew
what
they
were
talking
about
at
least
most
of
them
did.
the
findings
were
made.
they've
been
almost
ignored
by
the
government
in
this
case.
they
are
not
clearly
erroneous.
there's
no
question
about
that
and
there's
been
no
contention
as
the
equivocally
arise.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
i
think
they
have
to
be
in
order
to
be
reversed.
i
think
that's
clear
from
your
decisions.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
i'm
talking
about
the
finding,
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
no
sir,
it
is
not
all
the
factual
question.
now,
on
the
question
of
the
application
of
section
507,
the
batch-testing
provision
of
the
act,
this
doesn't
look
like
the
sort
of
things
which
lends
itself
to
description
as
a
part
of
a
batch.
to
me,
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
a
part
of
a
batch
which
is
to
be
tested
by
the
government,
the
term
“batch”
to
me
mr.
chief
justice
set
and
it
mean
something
with
some
homogenetic
to
it,
and
here
we
have
a
whole
different,
an
entirely
different
sort
of
an
article.
here
are
eight
different
antibiotic
substances
on
this
article.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
yes
sir,
they
came
from
a
batch
which
was
manufactured
by
a
company
which
manufactures
antibiotics
which
are
tested
by
the
government
on
section
507.
they
have
been
check-tested
i
doubt
not
because
i
can't
conceive
of
a
company
who
manufactures
antibiotics
and
sells
them
for
medicines,
manufacturing
separate
antibiotics
for
use
on
these
discs;
that
just
wouldn't
be
good
business.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
if
the
only
market
was
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
well,
the
government
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
the
government
said
it
would
require
it
because
they
consider
this
a
drug,
and
since
the
antibiotic
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
yes
sir,
but
they
also
would
consider
the
antibiotic
going
into
it
a
drug
because
it
would
be
a
component
of
the
drug
under
the
statute.
that
would
be
the
government's
attitude
as
i
understand
it.
but
they
can
speak
for
themselves
only.
sir?
mr.
edward
brown
williams
i
can't
conceive
that
he
would.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
i
think
they
are
check-tested
by
the
food
and
drug
administration.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
i
can
try
your
honor.
there
are
in
the
sensitivity
testing
procedure
which
is
entirely
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
yes
sir.
in
this
testing
procedure,
which
is
entirely
a
laboratory
operation
never
comes
anywhere
near
the
patient.
there
are
involved,
this
device
here
which
is
called
the
sensitivity
disc
both
has
an
antibiotic
substances
on
it.
a
petri
plate
upon
which
is
deposited
agar
which
is
strict
with
an
islet
from
the
patient.
on
top
of
the
agar,
with
the
islet
in
it
is
placed
this
discs
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
this
is
placed
to
this
disc.
around
the
disc,
if
the
antibiotic
is
sensitive
to
--
if
the
organism
from
the
patient
is
sensitive
to
the
particular
antibiotic
in
contact
with
it,
there
will
be
a
zone
of
inhibition.
if
it
is
not
sensitive
to
it,
there
will
no
zone
of
inhibition.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
sir?
mr.
edward
brown
williams
it's
put
on
an
agar
plate,
glass
or
china
plate
in
the
laboratory.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
it
doesn't.
the
only
thing
it
contacts
is
an
islet
which
is
taken
from
shall
we
say
“urine”
or
sputum
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
--
of
the
human
being;
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
yes.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
the
first
step
is
the
isolation,
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
--
i
think
some
18
hours.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
you
strict
the
agar
on
the
plate
of
dish
--
with
the
islet.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
i'm
not
sure
we
have
never
order
that.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
the
agar
goes
on
the
disc,
they
isolate
from
the
patient
goes
on
the
agar
--
i
mean,
on
the
dish.
they
isolate
from
the
patient
goes
on
the
agar
and
the
disc
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
it's
a
growing
medium,
to
grow
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
--
the
bacteria
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
--
in
the
isolate.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
yes.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
if
the
infection
or
the
infectious
strain
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
--
is
sensitive
to
the
antibiotic,
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
--
there
will
be
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
might
clear
it
up.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
you
don't
know
that
it
would
because
this
is
an
in
vitro-test
and
was
transferred
to
the
body
it
may
act
and
how
to
do
it.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
that
is
what
the
laboratory
technician
may
tell
the
doctor.
he
may
say
that
since
there
a
showing
of
sensitivity
in
vitro
that
you
might
try
this
because
it
maybe
effective
in
vivo.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
it
may
or
may
not.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
well,
i
would
assume
that
they
are
from
batches
which
have
been
tested
by
the
food
and
drug
administration.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
he
did
say
that.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
i
would
assume
differently.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
there's
nothing
in
the
record
on
that
your
honor.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
they
want
to
test
this
disc.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
that
is
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
that
is
the
position.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
that
is
the
position
of
the
government.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
they
claim
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
--
should
be
tested.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
the
government
i
think
they
should
be
tested
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
the
government
thinks
they
should
be
--
the
discs
themselves
should
be
tested
because
they
have
found
that
the
public
health
in
their
mind
will
be
endangered
if
they
are
not
tested.
we
have
seen
no
evidence
whatsoever
of
it
and
let
me
point
this
out
now.
in
six
years
since
this
litigation
began
in
1962
i
believe
or
61',
nobody
has
come
up
with
the
single
instances
of
an
erroneous
result
from
a
test
due
to
a
faulty
disc,
and
in
the
12
years
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
sir?
mr.
edward
brown
williams
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
oh!
other
discs
which
are
being
certified
of
the
disc.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
that
--
i
know
but
i'm
going
to
--
if
you
permit
me
sir.
in
the
12
years
pervious
to
certification,
in
those
years,
nobody
came
up
with
a
single
case
of
an
erroneous
interpretation
of
a
sensitivity
test
due
to
a
faulty
disc.
now,
dr.
turin
as
my
friend
said
at
the
hearing
--
at
the
trial,
stated
the
he
felt
there
was
a
danger
to
public
health
involved.
he
said
that
two
or
three
times,
he
was
asked
on
cross-examination
if
he
had
one
single
instance
to
which
he
could
point
to
show
that
the
public
health
was
involved
here.
he
could
not
point
to
any.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
sir,
it
is
not
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
well,
mr.
justice,
they
have
made
no
--
this
is
not
a
finding
made
by
the
agency
which
is
binding
on
the
courts.
i'm
not
asking
any
second
guessing.
i'm
asking
that
the
evidence
be
look
at.
it
shows
that
there
is
no
such
public
health
problem.
and
furthermore,
the
law
is
such
that
there
is
no
basis
in
my
opinion
for
a
holding
this
article
to
be
anything
other
than
a
drug.
unless,
possibly,
it
were
regarded
as
a
device
because
the
definition
involved
reads
in
terms
of
treatment
of
substances
intended
for
use
in
the
treatment
or
diagnosis
of
diseases.
now,
it's
quite
obvious
that
treatment
means
treatment
of
a
patient
and
nobody
can
maintain
that
with
the
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
well,
diagnosis
was
practically
abandoned
by
the
government
in
the
lower
court
as
a
ground
for
its
position.
they
come
back
to
it
in
the
upper
court,
but
dr.
keefer
made
it
quite
clear
and
he
was
perhaps
i
should
say
the
most
distinguished
witness
at
the
trial,
he
made
it
quite
clear
that
it
cannot
be
a
diagnosis
of
an
infection
without
identification
of
the
organism.
and
obvious
to
the
test
does
not
identify
the
organism.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
they
made
a
legal
conclusion
in
the
proceeding
which
is
been
referred
to
when
the
--
in
the
course
of
which
the
regulations
were
adopted.
they
made
a
legal
conclusion
that
the
disc
where
drugs.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
i
don't
recall
that
they
did.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
but
they
have
built
in
terms
of
diagnosis,
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
so
far
as
i
know,
that
was
not
considered
by
the
agency,
it
didn't
appear
in
the
public
proceeding.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
no
sir
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
well,
i
think
the
government's
point
was
that
the
language
of
the
device
section
and
201
(h)
of
its
statute
and
the
language
of
the
disc
of
the
drug
section
201
(g)
of
the
statute
are
quite
similar
except
in
that
201
(g)
excludes
devices
from
a
definition
of
drug.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
no,
you
would
not
have
batch-testing
but
you
could
have
control
as
we
point
out
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
--
in
our
brief
of
a
different
kind.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
yes.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
yes
sir.
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
control
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
it
isn't
before
the
court
in
my
opinion
sir.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
the
court
below
said
that
if
there
was
anything,
it
was
probably
a
device
because
the
only
difference
between
a
device
and
a
drug
is
that
a
device
is
an
apparatus
or
an
instrument
or
a
contragulants.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
no,
they
rule
it
was
a
drug
thereby
excluding
it
from
the
definition
of
device.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
no
sir,
there
would
be
no
doubt
it
was
drug.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
if
it
were
applied
to
the
human
body
for
diagnostic
purposes?
no
sir.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
yes
sir,
but
i
should
like
to
stress
mr.
justice
that
treatment
of
a
patient
is
the
test
of
whether
this
is
used
in
treatment
and
this
there
is
no
treatment
of
a
patient
by
this
device.
secondly,
it
cannot
be
use
in
diagnosis
because
it
does
not
identify
the
organism.
that
is
perfectly
clear.
you
can't
diagnose
unless
you
know
what
the
organism
is.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
diagnosis
is
recognition
of
disease.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
it
is
used
very
in
a
sense
and
to
determine
the
antibiotic
used
in
treatment
on
the
certain
circumstances.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
no
sir.
there
are
several
hundred,
maybe
thousands
of
laboratory
tools
of
this
nature
which
are
used
in
the
industry
and
in
clinical
laboratories
which
have
never
been
classified
as
drugs.
and
if
this
is
classified
as
a
drug,
i
can
see
no
alternative
to
classifying
all
of
these
other
hundreds
or
thousands
of
articles
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
i
believe
so
under
the
statute
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
i'll
tell
you
why
sir.
they
are
not
drugs
because
under
the
statutes,
it
is
well
establish,
there's
no
doubt
whatsoever
that
an
article
is
not
a
drug
unless
it
is
intended
for
use
in
the
treatment
or
diagnosis
or
prevention
or
cure
of
disease.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
this
is
not.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
no.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
well,
this
drug
could
--
if
this
drug
will
use
to
wash
a
window,
it
certainly
wouldn't
be
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
no
sir,
not
under
the
statute.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
not
under
the
statute.
it
might
be
a
drug
in
some
sense,
but
not
under
the
statute..
mr.
edward
brown
williams
no
sir,
it
is
not
because
it
does
not
identify
the
organism
and
without
identification
of
the
organism,
there
cannot
be
diagnosis.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
that
is
their
contention
and
i
obviously
don't
have
time
to
go
into
my
argument,
but
it
is
quite
clear
from
the
literature
and
from
the
trial
that
there
are
so
many
built-in
protections
against
the
sort
of
thing
the
government
apparently
feared
that
this
is
simply
not
going
to
occur.
the
physician
does
not
rely
principally
upon
this
test
even
if
his
initial
therapy
has
not
been
successful.
a
physician's
lye's
is
principle
--
sir?
mr.
edward
brown
williams
but
what
they
say
does
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
in
my
opinion,
it
isn't
the
case.
and
i
think
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
yes
and
i
asked
dr.
turin
for
some
kind
of
specifics
on
that
point.
he
could
give
me
none.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
after
16
years
mr.
chief
justice,
you
would
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
after
16
years
mr.
chief
justice
i
should
think
that
something
would've
occurred
if
that
were
going
to.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
the
government
through
its
research
has
come
up
with
nothing.that's
demonstrated
in
our
brief.
it
was
demonstrated
at
the
trial,
and
it
will
appear
from
the
literature
cited
by
the
government
itself.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
i
say
that
if
it
is
anything,
it's
a
device.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
no
sir.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
i
say
it's
very
realistically
under
the
statute,
is
neither.
but
if
it's
anything,
it
comes
more
than
here
that
being
an
apparatus
or
an
instrument
than
it
does
to
be
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
that
is
correct.
and
if
it
were
used
for
that,
then
it
would
be
more
likely
to
be
a
device.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
that's
my
position,
yes
sir.
i
would
like
to
conclude
by
saying
that
the
literature
cited
by
the
government
which
is
the
all
the
record
entirely
was
never
even
mentioned
at
the
trial,
shows
clearly
that
if
a
laboratory
as
all
good
laboratories
do
sets
up
the
proper
standards
of
zone
sizes
for
the
various
antibiotics
that
that
laboratory
and
any
other
which
does
that
will
have
no
problem
with
the
zone
sizes
is
which
seem
to
trouble
the
government
so.
that
is
very
clear
from
many
of
the
articles
cited
by
the
government
itself.
that
is
true
regardless
of
whether
there
are
certification
and
it
might
be
added
that
even
under
the
government's
certification
regulations,
the
claim
potency,
that
is
the
potency
claim
on
the
label
of
the
disc
may
vary
from
67%
to
150%
in
the
device
itself
or
the
sensitivity
disc
itself.
in
other
words,
you
can
be
from
67%
to
150%
off
and
still
get
these
discs
certified.
in
fact,
as
between
the
lowest
and
the
highest
disc
being
tested
by
the
government,
you
can
go
as
far
as
250%
off.
now,
that
kind
of
system
is
hardly
conducive
to
the
kind
of
outlaying
a
fear
which
the
government
wants
you.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
