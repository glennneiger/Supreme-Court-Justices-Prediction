all
the

justice
byron

these
all
factual?
justice
byron

white
well,
what
is
government
want
to
test
the
antibiotics?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
want
to
--
they
don't
want
just
to
test
the
batches
of
antibiotics
that
are
used
to
impregnate
this
disc.
they
want
to
take
the
completed
discs
and
test
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
they
claimed
that
there's
something
else
that
needs
testing
besides
the
antibiotics
that
are
used
to
impregnated
these
discs?
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
something
else
about
disc
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
is
there
something
that
happens
to
the
antibiotics
because
of
contact
with
the
disc
which
means
that
the
discs
themselves
be
impregnated
this
have
to
be
tested?
justice
byron

or
would
they
to
be
satisfied
with
having
with
testing
the
antibiotics
used
to
impregnate
the

justice
byron

have
they

have

ever

that's
a

justice
byron

white
well,
we
suppose
to
second
guess
the

on
this
kind
of
a
judgment
--
justice
byron

white
--
public
health
is
in
danger
or
not
now,
do
you
really
suggest
that
we
--
justice
byron

white
well,
what
about
diagnosis
mr.
williams?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
agency
make
any
--
as
the
agency
at
any
time
made
any
findings
with
respect
to
why
this
disc
qualified
either
under
the
treatment
or
the
diagnosis?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
didn't
say
whether
it
was
because
of
the
treatment
or
diagnosis?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
the
government
though
all
that
concedes
that
the
disc
is
also
covered
by
the
definition
of
device?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
that
this
disc
is
not
a
device
either?
justice
byron

white
under
the
--
(voice

does
it
have
to
be
one
or
the
other
either
a
drug
or
a
device?
justice
byron

but
do
you
say
it's
neither
or
do
you
say
its

justice

what
to

it
has
to
be
used
for
the
diagnosis

treatment
of
a
disease
