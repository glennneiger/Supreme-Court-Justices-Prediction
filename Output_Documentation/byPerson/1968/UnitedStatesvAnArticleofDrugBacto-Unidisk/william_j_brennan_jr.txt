justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
layman's
terms.
you
take
in
some
excretion
from
the
body?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
apparently,
it
has
some
kind
of
infection
in
it.
the
infection
takes
what
a
bacterial
form
or
something
like
that,
does
it?
if
an
antibiotic
is
used
this
treatment,
it
will
effect
only
bacteria,
yes
sir.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right,
and
so,
they
take
the
fluid
whatever
it
is;
they
put
it
in
the
dish?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whatever
you
call
a
dish,
they
isolate
from
it
whatever
the
particular
infection
in
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isolation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
you
put
this
thing
in
the
dish
itself
don't
you
this
disc?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
don't
strict
me,
will
you?
they
take
this
thing
don't
they
and
they
put
it
in
some
kind
of
a
dish,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
want
to
get
straight.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
agar?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
now,
then
these
little
pegs
on
this
thing
are
already
impregnated
with
various
kinds
of
antibiotics,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
there
is
some
kind
of
attraction
to
the
particular
antibiotic
which
would
be
effective
against
this
particular
infection
whatever
it
maybe,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
sensitive,
meaning
that
the
antibiotic
might
clear
it
up?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
nevertheless,
this
is
then
the
tell
whom
of
the
laboratory
technician
or
the
doctor?
look
this
is
the
kind
of
antibiotic
it
would
appear
might
be
effective
against
this
infection
in
this
patient's
body,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right,
and
it
may
or
may
not
work?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
point
is
this
disc
is
out
of
a
case
after
it
has
performed
that
function?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right,
and
as
i
understand
it
from
what
at
least
what
mr.
wallace
suggested
to
us;
the
antibiotics
used
to
impregnate
these
little
things
on
this
disc
are
not
taken
from
batches
which
have
been
certified,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
mr.
wallace
told
us
that's
one
of
the
problems
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
what's
the
record
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what's
the
record
show?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
i
take
it
with
the
idea,
i
think
that's
what
mr.
wallace
said
that
except
as
whatever
is
that
impregnate
these
discs
have
gone
through
the
certification
procedures.
you
can't
be
sure
that
the
role
that
this
disc
is
supposed
to
perform
can
be
properly
performed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
at
that
then,
may
have
a
deleterious
effect
in
consequence
upon
the
patient
who
maybe
treated
by
a
result
which
because
it's
not
been
impregnated
were
certified
batches
might
come
up
with
the
wrong
answer
or
no
answer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
that
the
government
does
not
claim
that
whatever
it
was
use
to
impregnate
was
not
batch-tested,
indeed
they
may
well
hold.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
the
government
feels
nevertheless
these
should
be
given
other
test,
is
that
right?
