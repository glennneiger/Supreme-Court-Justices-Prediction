mr.
bruce
bromley
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
yes,
please.
they
â€“
there
are
at
least
four
undisputed
matters
before
us
to
which
my
two
friends
have
made
scant
attention.
first
as
this
court
is
fully
aware,
this
is
an
action
against
the
members
of
the
house
questioning
their
action
in
there
official
capacity
as
petitioners
emphatic
announce
below.
here,
we
are
suing
the
legislative
branch.
this
action
then
is
not
an
action
against
private
parties
or
against
the
united
states
with
its
consent
to
secure
the
declaration
of
unconstitutionality
of
a
statute
passed
by
the
congress.
it
is
directed
solely
to
the
members
in
their
capacity
as
members
of
the
house
and
three
of
their
agents
who
acted
within
the
house
pursuant
to
the
command
of
the
house.
it
is
our
view
that
this
court
does
not
have
the
power
to
entertain
this
action
against
the
members
any
more
than
it
would
have
the
power
to
order
the
members
to
pass
or
repeal
a
statute.
second,
there
is
no
dispute
now
as
to
the
correctness
of
the
findings
made
by
the
select
committee
of
the
90th
congress.
to
the
effect
that
mr.
powell
misappropriated
large
sums
of
government
funds
that
he
was
in
civil
and
criminal
contempt
at
the
time
of
the
action
of
the
new
york
courts.
that
he
maintained
unlawfully
an
improper
person
on
his
congressional
payroll
and
that
he
refused
to
cooperate
in
a
perfectly
proper
investigation
of
his
conduct,
conducted
by
two
committees,
one
of
the
89th
congress
and
one
of
the
90th.
now,
the
serious
charges
against
mr.
powell
were
not
denied
by
him
at
any
time.
they
were
not
denied
by
him
before
the
committees
which
investigated
him.
they
were
not
denied
by
him
at
the
time
the
house
convened.
now,
considered
the
matter
and
reach
its
decision.
they
were
not
denied
by
him
in
the
compliant
which
was
filed
two
years
ago.
they
were
not
denied
by
him
in
the
lower
courts
below
--
in
the
courts
below
and
they
are
not
denied
here.
mr.
bruce
bromley
no,
your
honor.
it
is
not.
mr.
bruce
bromley
no,
that's
not
right
sir.
mr.
bruce
bromley
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
they
said
that
probably
but
if
they
did
it's
not
correct.
mr.
bruce
bromley
now
third,
the
complaint
in
this
case
does
not
allege
that
mr.
powell
was
excluded
because
of
his
race
and
the
record
before
the
house
when
it
came
to
reach
its
decision
of
expulsion.
it
does
not
even
suggest
that
such
an
allegation
would
be
supported.
accordingly,
i
say
it
has
no
proper
place
in
this
case.
fourthly,
the
action
of
the
house
of
the
91st
congress,
the
present
congress
in
fining
mr.
powell
$25,000.00
and
depriving
him
of
his
seniority,
likewise,
is
not
before
this
court.
the
action
of
the
91st
house
is
not
challenged
in
the
compliant.
the
parties
to
any
such
claim
that
is
the
members
of
the
present
congress
and
their
agents
are
not
parties
to
this
action
in
their
capacity
as
members
of
this
congress.
the
moreover,
this
court
i
submit
it
does
not
have
original
jurisdiction
to
hear
any
such
claim.
and
so,
the
precise
question
as
we
see
it
is
whether
any
court
in
a
suit
against
the
members
of
the
house
of
the
90th
congress
can
review
a
decision
of
those
members
acting
pursuant
to
their
constitutional
powers
to
judge
the
qualifications
of
their
own
members
to
exclude
the
member
elect
solely
for
reasons
of
personal
misconduct
and
that's
all
mr.
powell
was
excluded
for
here.
mr.
bruce
bromley
i
should
say
sir
in
answer
to
that
question
of
action
of
the
house
would
be
clearly
unconstitutional.
mr.
bruce
bromley
but
as
i
read
the
speech
or
debate
clause
he
would
not
sir.
so,
our
position
is
that
what
the
house
did
in
this
matter
was
for
the
house
on
the
house
alone
to
decide
and
its
action
should
not
and
is
not
subject
to
judicial
review.
before
discussing
however
the
reasons
for
that
answer,
i
wish
to
emphasize
again
as
we
do
in
our
suggestion
of
mootness
and
in
our
brief
that
in
my
judgment
that
this
action
is
clearly
moot.
the
house
of
the
90th
congress
against
which
relief
is
sought
as
terminate.
mr.
powell
can
no
longer
be
seated
in
that
house.
there
is
now
a
new
house.
he
now
seats
in
that
house
and
i
believe
for
that
reason
in
that
simple
reason,
the
case
is
moot.
but
it
is
my
purpose
to
devote
the
remainder
of
my
time
to
the
substantive
issue.
mr.
bruce
bromley
back
salary
is
so
incidental
to
the
main
prayer
for
relief
that
i
do
not
feel
it
could
justify
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
it
is
completely
de
minimis.
he
was
paid
up
to
march
1,
1967,
the
date
on
which
he
was
expelled.
he
was
re-elected
very
promptly
and
he
could
have
prevented
himself
to
the
house
in
april
of
the
same
year.
and
as
the
speaker
said,
twice
the
matter
would
be
considered
again
in
light
of
the
very
important
new
factor
that
he
had
been
re-elected
as
it
was
last
january
but
mr.
powell
chose
to
stay
away.
he
never
presented
himself.
he
never
came
near
the
house.
so,
i
say
he
clearly
has
no
claim
for
any
salary
except
maybe
a
month's
salary.
mr.
bruce
bromley
no,
your
honor.
it
would
not.
mr.
bruce
bromley
because
in
the
first
place,
the
salary
can't
be
paid
unless
the
oath
is
administered.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
i
think
this
court
would
have
no
jurisdiction
against
the
sergeant
of
the
--
and
the
relief
would
have
to
be
against
the
sergeant
ordering
him
to
pay
when
he
is
prohibited
by
statute
from
doing
it.
mr.
bruce
bromley
i
certainly
would
sir.
and
in
that
court,
the
united
states
should
have
the
opportunity
which
it
might
be
very
well
seize
of
pleading
a
counterclaim
were
a
set
off
for
the
50
or
so
thousand
dollars
of
its
funds
which
mr.
powell
had
taken
unlawfully.
mr.
bruce
bromley
well,
it's
moot
now
so
you
couldn't
have
a
declaratory
judgment.
but
if
you
could
and
i
don't
think
you
could
have
one
anyway.
i
don't
think
the
action
would
foreclose
it
but
i
don't
think
this
court
should
grant
a
declaratory
judgment
whether
that
matter
is
in
the
court
of
claims
or
whether
it
isn't.
mr.
bruce
bromley
i
think
so
clearly
sir.
mr.
bruce
bromley
because
he's
been
seated.
you
--
nothing
you
can
do
about
the
90th
congress,
i
respectfully
submit.
it's
gone.
you
can't
seat
him
in
that
congress
and
that
the
present
congress
is
the
one
in
which
he
has
been
seated.
and
that
action
the
propriety
of
the
fine
which
he
got
and
the
laws
of
seniority
which
he
got
in
company
with
his
seating
is
not
attack
in
the
complaint,
and
it
is
not
here.
mr.
bruce
bromley
not
if
he
proceeded
promptly,
it
wouldn't
be.
mr.
bruce
bromley
no,
i
didn't
say
he
was
paid.
he
was
paid
up
to
march
1,
1967
when
he
was
excluded.
mr.
bruce
bromley
by
resolution
of
the
house.
that
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
that's
right.
the
resolution
said
he
should
be
paid
while
the
hearings
were
going
on
and
up
to
his
date
of
--
up
to
the
date
of
decision.
mr.
bruce
bromley
of
course,
my
point
about
the
salary
is
after
he
was
paid
the
march
1st,
he
could
have
come
back
and
the
result
might
have
been
entirely
different
as
it
was
last
january.
the
reason
he
didn't
get
his
salary
after
april
1967
until
january
1969
was
because
he
never
presented
himself.
he
never
asked
the
house
to
reconsider
in
the
light
of
the
important
fact
that
he
had
been
overwhelmingly
re-elected
in
harlem.
now,
i
submit
that
there
are
at
least
five
separate
reasons
why
his
demands
for
relief
cannot
be
granted
and
i'd
like
to
summarize
them
briefly
before
i
start
to
discuss
it.
in
the
first
place,
although,
we
haven't
heard
any
mention
of
it.
article
i
section
5,
the
speech
or
debate
clause
affirmatively
barged
any
court
from
questioning
members
of
the
house
or
their
agents
with
respect
to
actions
taken
by
them
within
the
house
such
as
the
exercise
of
their
constitutional
power
to
judge
the
qualifications
of
one
of
their
members.
second,
i
don't
think
federal
courts
have
any
subject
matter
jurisdiction
here
because
article
i
section
5
assigns
the
sole
adjudicatory
power
to
the
house
by
declaring
that
the
house
is
the
judge
of
the
qualifications
of
its
members.
that
delegation
of
judicial
power
under
article
i,
like
the
power
of
the
trial
impeachment
if
you
please
is
an
explicit
exception
to
the
general
grant
of
judicial
power
to
the
courts
under
article
iii.
since
the
legislative
is
co-equal
with
the
judicial
branch,
the
judgments
which
the
house
makes
in
this
situation
in
the
field
allocated
to
it,
i.e.
the
qualification
of
its
members
are
exclusive
and
supreme.
thirdly,
the
court
should
not
proceed
in
this
case
because
it
involves
a
nonjusticiable
political
question.
fourthly,
if
the
courts
could
review
the
propriety
what
the
house
did.
it
is
clear
that
the
house
acted
within
its
constitutional
powers
when
it
excluded
mr.
powell.
but
the
constitutional
power
of
each
house,
the
judge
qualifications
is
not
limited
as
had
has
been
stated
so
many
times
here
to
the
three
standing
disqualifications
of
age,
citizenship,
and
inhabitancy.
it
extends
as
well
to
matters
of
personal
misconduct
on
the
fitting
a
member
of
the
house
and
even
three
--
if
these
three
standing
disqualifications
were
exclusive,
the
house's
action
in
any
event
would
be
justified
under
its
expulsion
power.
since
the
two-thirds
vote
required
for
expulsion
was
obtained.
and
fifthly,
assuming
that
the
lower
federal
courts
did
have
the
power
to
rule
on
the
merits
of
the
case,
under
the
circumstances
presented
here,
those
courts
did
not
abuse
their
discretion
in
declining
to
grant
the
extraordinary
and
discretionary
relief
prayed
for.
now,
i
submit
that
anyone
of
these
five
reasons
is
sufficient
to
require
dismissal
of
the
action.
mr.
bruce
bromley
i
think
so,
of
course
it
was
improper
and
unconstitutional.
mr.
bruce
bromley
no
relief
because
the
power
to
judge
which
includes
the
power
to
judge
erroneously
has
been
confided
to
the
house.
mr.
bruce
bromley
no.
i
wouldn't
contest
that.
mr.
bruce
bromley
it's
correct.
yes,
but
outside
the
house
but
not
for
action
in
pursuant
to
its
adjudicatory
constitutional
power
to
act
within
the
house.
mr.
bruce
bromley
but
if
kilbourn
against
thompson
certainly
that
action
didn't
take
place
within
the
house.
the
witness
would
seize
outside
the
house.
mr.
bruce
bromley
true
that
there
were
some
authorization
within
the
house
that
they
act
which
the
courts
had
jurisdiction
of
was
the
seizure
outside
the
house
and
i
think
that
distinction,
however,
artificial
it
may
seem
is
one
which
is
dictated
by
the
allocation
through
the
power
to
judge
the
qualifications
of
its
members,
power
to
make
its
own
rules
of
its
proceedings,
and
the
bar
which
is
set
up
against
attack
in
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
mr.
bruce
bromley
no,
sir.
i
would
not
but
i
think
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
it
would
reside
in
this
court,
in
spite
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
mr.
bruce
bromley
well,
it's
a
harder
case
but
that
might
be
first
place
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
well,
i
think
it
is
because
of
your
remark
about
other
perversions
in
bond
against
floyd
there
--
i
must
admit
there
are
some
perversions
which
this
court
must
be
ingenious
enough
to
find
a
way
around
the
speech
or
debate
clause
or
else
will
be
confronted
with
revolution
or
worse.
so,
i
don't
say
that
the
other
perversions
which
this
maybe
and
lastly,
this
maybe
an
attempt
by
a
congress
to
add
another
standing
disqualification
which
it
has
no
power
to
do
and
which
i
don't
think
could
be
attacked
if
it
tried
to
do
it
to
cause
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
mr.
bruce
bromley
i
think
somebody's
got
to
draw
the
lines
somewhere.
mr.
bruce
bromley
the
house
draws
that
line
sir.
mr.
bruce
bromley
except
in
cases
of
under
perversions,
sir.
mr.
bruce
bromley
in
my
opinion
it
would
not
sir,
although,
clearly
unconstitutional,
clearly
improper.
now,
very
little
has
been
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
well,
a
great
many
things.
mr.
bruce
bromley
seizing
the
president
and
dragging
him
in
to
the
well
of
the
house
under
a
resolution
that
he
be
beheaded.
mr.
bruce
bromley
he
isn't
seeking
a
place.
no,
i'm
talking
about
house
action
which
constitutes
another
perversion
of
its
function.
mr.
bruce
bromley
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
recognize
that
it
has
a
strange
sound
coming
from
any
lawyer
to
tell
this
court
that
something
unconstitutional
may
have
occurred
and
yet
you
have
no
power
to
intervene.
but
i've
--
i
make
that
contention
in
this
posture
and
i
rest
it
squarely
on
the
speech
or
debate
clause
as
interpreted
by
at
least
three
cases
decided
here
under
that
clause.
but
that
clause
providing
that
for
any
speech
or
debate
in
the
house,
its
members
shall
not
be
questioned
at
any
place
underscores
and
enforces
the
separation
of
power
doctrine
embedded
in
our
constitution.
it
has
the
broad
purpose,
i
submit
of
protecting
the
integrity
and
independence
of
the
federal
legislative
branch
from
any
interference
whatsoever
by
the
executive
or
judicial
branches
even
to
the
extent
of
imposing
upon
the
members
the
inconvenience
and
expense
of
defending
themselves.
no
longer
is
there
--
does
anyone
question
the
fact
that
speech
or
debate
is
not
limited
to
words
spoken
in
debate
in
the
house
but
includes
everything
done
in
the
house
in
connection
with
its
business
such
as
the
act
of
holding
the
passage
of
a
resolution
directing
the
activities
of
its
agents
and
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
because
it's
confined
only,
your
honor,
to
the
action
which
the
members
take
in
connection
with
the
regulation
of
their
own
proceedings
within
the
house.
and
mind
you,
that's
why
i
emphasized
at
the
outset
in
the
suit
against
the
members.
it
doesn't
officiate
a
broad
area
at
all
sir,
it
only
vitiates
a
very
narrow
area.
now
the
three
cases
that
i
mention,
this
immunity
from
attacked
put
up
with
the
speech
or
debate
clause
covers,
well,
let's
take
kilbourn
against
thompson
first.
that
involves
the
passage
of
a
resolution
directing
the
illegal
and
unconstitutional
incarceration
imprisonment
of
a
private
individual
sued
against
the
members
barred
by
speech
or
debate
even
though
their
action
was
clearly
unconstitutional.
the
alleged
unlawful
and
unconstitutional
activity
of
seizing
private
property
in
the
context
of
an
effort
to
suppress
free
speech,
last
terms
dombrowski
against
eastland.
and
finally,
activity
which
results
in
the
clear
violation
of
a
criminal
statute,
united
states
against
johnson,
the
only
possible
limitation
as
i
said
before
on
the
speech
or
debate
clause
is
what
this
court
said
in
kilbourn.
and
what
it
described
as
possible
other
perversions
and
the
example
that
i
gave
of
the
heading
the
precedent
was
given
by
this
court
in
the
opinion
in
kilbourn
as
an
example
of
an
utter
perversion,
i
didn't
make
it
up.
now,
what
other
cases
would
be
included
in
this
doctrine
of
other
perversion?
well,
that's
a
very
difficult
question
but
i
am
willing
to
say
i
think
but
what
its
worth
that
probably
if
all
blacks
were
excluded
in
any
fashion
either
seriatim
or
by
the
passage
of
a
rule
that
would
be
an
utter
perversion
possibly.
i'm
sure
if
all
republicans
were
excluded
it
would
clearly
be
an
utter
perversion.
but
i
say
probably
not
if
only
one
will
act
were
excluded
such
as
here
assuming
contrary
to
the
fact
that
mr.
powell
was
excluded
because
of
his
race.
he'd
probably
not
give
if
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
sir?
mr.
bruce
bromley
ten
blacks.
well,
10
at
one
time.
mr.
bruce
bromley
i
take
it
my
way.
mr.
bruce
bromley
well,
10
at
one
time
and
if
there
are
only
10
in
the
house
i
can't
tell
you.
i
don't
know.
maybe
we
could
get
some
help
if
we
took
the
analogy
of
impeachment.
suppose
the
president
were
impeached
on
unconstitutional
grounds
of
race,
religion,
or
speech
and
removed
from
office
by
the
senate.
i
say
this
court
could
do
nothing
about
it
in
a
suit
against
members
of
the
senate
because
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
and
the
fact
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
i
was
about
to
say
and
because
i
think
as
well
the
fact
that
the
constitutional
lodges
the
ultimate
power
to
try
impeachments
in
the
senate
under
article
i
just
as
the
constitution
allocates
the
power
to
judge
the
qualifications
in
the
house
or
perhaps
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
oh!
no,
sir.
mr.
bruce
bromley
oh!
no,
sir.
it
states
--
it
states
three
or
more
standing
disqualifications
that
affect
the
class.
no
person
shall
be
a
representative
who
has
not
obtained
the
age
of
25
and
is
a
resident
citizen
of
state
court
he
comes.
i
think
that's
--
that's
a
standing
disqualification
and
doesn't
that
all
evidence
an
intent
on
the
part
of
the
framers
to
overrule
the
longstanding
power
of
legislative
bodies
for
over
two
centuries
to
discipline
their
own
members
for
personal
misconduct.
well,
that
goes
back
to
the
16th
century.
mr.
bruce
bromley
that's
a
fair
statement,
yes.
mr.
bruce
bromley
so,
long
as
we
qualify
it
by
understanding
that
my
contention
about
that
power
to
exclude
is
probably
limited
to
cases
of
misconduct
unbefitting
the
trust
and
confidence
that
ought
to
be
placed
in
the
member.
mr.
bruce
bromley
a
conduct.
mr.
bruce
bromley
something
for
the
house,
and
the
house
alone.
mr.
bruce
bromley
well
you
may,
i'm
not
sure
i
quite
understand
it
but
my
position
is
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
adopt
its
own
standards.
i
can't
adopt
any
additional
standing
disqualifications.
mr.
bruce
bromley
that
they
must
judge
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
i
know
it's
difficult.
mr.
bruce
bromley
but
the
--
i
might
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
under
speech
or
debate,
i
do
not
believe
so.
no,
sir.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
sir.
now,
that
i
must
repeat
even
though
i
know
it
may
bore
you.
these
questions
have
nothing
to
do
with
our
case.
there
was
nothing
unconstitutional
about
mr.
powell's
exclusion
once
you
agree
that
the
power
to
judge
the
qualifications
for
misconduct
is
lodge
in
the
house
as
i
think
is
perfectly
clear
by
the
practice
of
all
the
legislatures
and
our
congress
right
down
to
the
present
time.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
bromley
i
would
make
no
such
distinction
sir
and
there
are
many,
many
cases
of
the
legislative
practice
of
excluding
felons,
perjurers,
and
we
even
have
some
presidents
for
persons
who
had
been
contemptuous
of
the
court's
outside
the
house.
i
think
that
a
well-defined
legislative
common
law
that
came
along
with
this
speech
or
debate
clause
into
the
constitution.
well,
i
was
talking
about
impeachment
and
i
said
that
i
thought
that
was
an
analogy
because
the
speech
or
debate
clause
applied
to
impeachment,
even
though
it
was
on
at
utterly
unconstitutional
grounds.
now,
coming
to
this
contention
of
the
petitioners
for
a
moment,
as
i
understand
them
they
say,
well,
speech
or
debate
may
bar
the
imposition
of
criminal
or
civil
penalties
after
the
event.
but
it
doesn't
forbid
the
course
the
kind
of
relief
inherent
in
an
injunction
or
a
writ
or
declaratory
judgment.
however,
it
seems
to
us
that
in
order
to
effectuate
the
immunity
afforded
by
the
speech
or
debate
clause,
it
must
apply
to
injunction,
mandamus,
or
declaratory
judgment,
of
course,
it
is
far
simpler
to
intimidate
critical
legislators
by
direct
order
of
a
court
with
its
attention
--
attended
sanctions
than
it
is
by
the
indirect
threat
of
subsequent
criminal
or
civil
proceedings.
and
as
i've
indicated,
i
don't
believe
petitioners
have
overcome
their
difficulty
by
now
limiting
their
prayer
to
a
declaratory
judgment
because
the
declaratory
judgment
is
itself
i
submit
in
the
most
direct
and
positive
sense,
a
questioning
of
speech
or
debate
taken
in
the
house.
furthermore
in
this
situation,
i
think
there
should
be
a
doctrine
and
probably
is
that
declaratory
relief
should
not
lie
where
the
suit
for
injunction
is
barred
at
least
by
the
separation
of
power's
doctrine
as
it
is
here
for
unless
declaratory
judgment
is
to
feel
wholly
gratuitous
and
advisory,
and
useless
act.
it
must
rely
for
its
efficacy
upon
the
willingness
of
the
members
to
acquiesce
in
the
court's
interpretation
of
it's
--
of
the
house's
powers.
thus,
insofar
as
a
declaratory
judgment
would
be
given
force
and
effect
by
the
member
voluntary
acquiescence,
it
would
be,
i
submit
as
effective
and
impingement
and
interference
with
legislative
proceedings
as
a
flat
injunction
would
be.
i
want
to
say
a
word
about
nonmember
agents
because
in
the
dombrowski
against
eastland,
the
court
said
that
the
immunity
extends
to
the
sergeant
at
arms
in
this
case
to
the
clerk
and
the
doorkeeper
who
are
three
individual
defendants
in
this
matter.
and
this
court
said
the
immunity
extends
although
it
is
less
absolute.
but
it
seems
to
me,
of
course
there
the
agent
of
the
senate
mr.
sowerwine
was
held
not
protected
by
the
clause
because
he
is
alleged
to
have
conspired
down
in
louisiana
with
some
people
to
make
an
illegal
seizure
of
some
papers
which
senator
eastland
wanted.
here,
the
only
thing
that
these
three
gentlemen
did
was
to
obey
the
command
of
the
house
within
the
house
and
it
seems
to
me
the
immunity
therefore
clearly
applies
to
them.
i
want
to
say
a
word
about
power
to
judge
qualifications
and
the
power
to
expel.
let's
assume
for
a
moment
contrary
to
my
basic
position
that
this
court
may
properly
review
the
action
of
the
house
in
this
case.
i
nevertheless
say
that
the
action
of
the
house
in
doing
what
it
did
to
mr.
powell
was
clearly
within
its
constitutional
powers
for
it
clearly
was
within
the
constitutional
grant
in
my
view
of
the
power
to
judge
his
qualifications
to
seat
and
i
had
no
use
my
repeating
that
i
do
not
believe
this
constitutional
disqualifications
under
more
than
three
of
them
are
exclusive
in
all
that
the
framers
had
before
them
illustration
of
state
constitutions
which
made
this
matter
clear.
i
said
that
the
legislature
in
various
states
like
new
hampshire
and
massachusetts
had
the
power
to
judge
the
qualifications
contained
in
this
constitution
and
one
of
the
men
who
work
on
the
draft
of
the
constitution
came
from
massachusetts
or
new
hampshire
that
he
was
fully
familiar
with
his
own
constitution.
and
yet,
the
framers
chose
to
adopt
language
not
so
specifically
limited
and
the
reason
they
did
it
i
think
it's
because
they
new
fully
well
and
realize
and
all
that
to
retain
the
power
to
purged
themselves
of
dishonest,
disgraceful
people
because
of
the
obligation
they
owed
to
the
whole
nation
to
have
a
legislative
body
made
up
at
least
of
decent,
honorable
citizens.
mr.
bruce
bromley
they
fix
her
by
undoubted
practice
of
all
legislatures
that
control
there
own
disciplinary
matters
and
by
the
doctrine
that
the
legislatures
have
power
to
compel
--
over
their
internal
affairs
and
the
judge
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
oh!
no.
they
can't
--
i
don't
--
they
can't
constitutionally
add
to
the
standing
of
--
the
standing
disqualifications
contained
in
the
constitution.
they
can't
have
a
rule.
they
can't
adopt
the
res
--
our
rule
resolution
that
certain
classes,
people
who
do
not
posses
$50,000.00
worth
of
property
are
not
qualified
to
seat.
they
can't
do
that
that
would
unconstitutionally
add
to
the
provisions
of
the
constitution.
mr.
bruce
bromley
they
are
specified
in
the
constitution
the
three
that
i've
mentioned.
in
addition,
there
are
couple
more
person
who
can't
take
the
oath
of
loyalty
and
the
person
who
holds
the
federal
office.
mr.
bruce
bromley
he
complied
with
all
of
those.
yes.
mr.
bruce
bromley
they
are
not
any
expressed
in
the
constitution
except
as
his
residence
are
phrase
to
judge
the
qualifications
which
has
a
meaning
that
is
personal
conduct
is
a
qualification.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
i
do.
i
say
in
addition
to
following
those
expressed
in
the
constitution
under
the
power
to
judge
provision,
they
have
the
right
to
judge
whether
the
man's
character
and
action
is
that
it
is
worthy
of
a
member
there
body
or
whether
the
man
is
a
crook
and
ought
to
be
thrown
out.
and
i
say
that's
so
deeply
embedded
in
our
whole
system
that
i
really
don't
see
how
anybody
can
question
it.
mr.
bruce
bromley
well,
i
don't
think
your
cases
have
ever
had
occasion
to
consider
it.
however,
the
historical
matter
that
i
refer
going
back
centuries
is
contained
in
this
appendix
that
we
have
filed
with
the
court.
it's
more
blue-covered
doctrine
in
which
we
list
the
precedents
in
england,
in
the
american
colonies,
and
the
american
states.
at
great
length
showing
how
widespread
the
power
with
--
was
and
how
widely
it
was
exercise
what
the
grounds
were.
for
instance
on
page
19
(a)
back
of
our
brief,
we
summarize
some
of
the
things
from
our
appendix,
mr.
whittemore
in
south
carolina
excluded
from
41st
congress
by
a
vote
for
selling
appointments
to
the
military
and
naval
academies.
now,
it
doesn't
say
whether
he
did
that
while
he
was
in
the
congress
at
least
the
summary
doesn't
or
before
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
he
got
there
but
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
mr.
bruce
bromley
not
a
bit.
mr.
bruce
bromley
not
a
bit.
because
if
he's
guilty
of
prior
misconduct
he's
just
about
as
unfit
to
seat
so
he
conduct
it
a
--
committed
the
same
impropriety
while
he
was
acting.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
he
has
the
same
rights.
mr.
bruce
bromley
oh!
surely.
mr.
bruce
bromley
surely,
if
the
congress
before
he
sworn
gives
him
that
right
which
it
did
here
by
resolution.
the
rules
of
the
house
gave
him
the
right
to
be
heard
and
they
offered
it
to
him.
they
offered
him
to
have
full
right
to
produce
witnesses
proceed
in
the
investigations
in
both
houses
to
appear
on
the
floor
with
his
counsel
to
make
any
statement
he
wanted
to.
he
never
showed
up.
he
boycotted
these
hearings
and
has
never
denied
the
factual
findings
which
were
resulted
from
these
hearings.
mr.
bruce
bromley
oh!
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes.
i
think
it's
a
pure
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
well
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
we
do
in
that
area.
furthermore,
we
cite
in
re
chapman
decided
by
this
court
in
which
the
court
affirmed
the
action
of
the
house
and
made
a
statement
that
the
offense
which
grounded
the
exclusion
was
not
a
statutory
offense.
it
was
not
committed
while
he
was
in
the
house
or
at
the
seat
of
government
or
not
even
during
a
session
and
it
negated
all
of
the
requirements
that
the
conduct
be
limited
to
his
conduct
while
he
was
in
the
house.
this
opinion
in
re
chapman
approve
the
case
of
william
blunt,
not
long
ago
in
1797
in
which
the
house
found
that
his
conduct,
although,
not
taking
place
during
the
time
of
his
service
was
nevertheless
a
proper
ground
for
expelling
or
excluding.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
it's
been
discussed.
mr.
bruce
bromley
they
never
reached
in
any
case
that
we
can
find
a
square
decision
on
that.
mr.
bruce
bromley
that's
right.
but
of
course,
you
understand
that
my
contention
is
that
a
matter
for
the
house
to
decide.
mr.
bruce
bromley
i
call
your
honor's
attention
to
page
19
(a)
of
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
our
brief,
where
we
list
a
summary
of
precedents
of
the
house
in
senate
regarding
exclusion
or
expulsion
on
grounds
other
than
the
three
standing
disqualifications.
mr.
bruce
bromley
contrary?
are
they?
mr.
bruce
bromley
oh!
yes.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes.
mr.
bruce
bromley
no.
no,
they
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
well,
the
house
is
never
--
the
house
itself
formally
never
thought
this
is
acting
on
an
expulsion
matter.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
but
isn't
that
the
distinction
since
there
was
a
two-thirds
vote.
absolutely
immaterial,
what
would
this
court
be
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
but
i
just
want
to
say
this
--
this
work
should
the
court
order
the
house
not
an
existence
to
go
back
and
seat
him
and
then
expel
him?
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
but
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
but
isn't
that
--
isn't
it
--
couldn't
they
clearly
distinguished
mr.
powell's
situation.
he
had
$50,000.00
which
he
taken.
he
had
it
through
--
he
took
it
prior
to
the
90th
congress
but
he
had
it
in
his
possession
at
the
time
the
90th
acted,
he
saw
no
reason
for
offering
to
give
it
back
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
with
the
what?
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes.
mr.
bruce
bromley
he
had
the
money,
yes.
and
the
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
well,
i
opted
a
little
or
defined
the
specific
finding
--
specific
findings
of
the
report,
say
that
he
willfully
and
unlawfully
appropriated
to
his
own
use.
there
are
two
findings,
25,000
add,
50,000
add,
16,000
add
and
you
add
them
up
and
they
come
to
over
$44,000.00.
mr.
bruce
bromley
well,
i
--
maybe
i
should
have
said
$44,892.02
mr.
bruce
bromley
all
i
said
was
that
he
never
offered
to
return
it.
the
government
never
got
it
back.
i
don't
know
what
he
did
with
it,
maybe
spend
it
but
we
didn't
give.
we
the
citizens
of
this
country
didn't
get
it
back.
in
addition
to
which,
there
were
many
other
improper
expenditures.
mr.
bruce
bromley
they
charged
--
they
found
that
he
misappropriated
their
finding
was
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
what?
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
sir.
i
suppose
that
was
crime.
mr.
bruce
bromley
it
might
be
embezzlement,
yes.
mr.
bruce
bromley
well,
he
wasn't
fined
in
the
90th
congress.
he
was
fined
in
the
present
congress
which
is
not
before
your
honors,
but
what
were
doing?
they
were
exercising
their
constitutional
power
to
punish
him.
mr.
bruce
bromley
that's
what
the
constitution
says.
mr.
bruce
bromley
well,
no
it's
just
says
to
punish
him.
mr.
bruce
bromley
perhaps
no.
no,
they
couldn't.
mr.
bruce
bromley
the
house
indicted
him.
mr.
bruce
bromley
well,
they
could
send
him
to
a
grand
jury
own
his
own.
mr.
bruce
bromley
that
was
the
91st
congress
which
isn't
before
you
and
before
a
judge
in
the
jury
he
admits
all
the
issue,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
bromley
why
not?
he's
never
denied
it,
never
disputed
it
at
any
time.
mr.
bruce
bromley
well,
i
should
think
in
this
posture
that
we
ought
to
come
here
with
some
statement
from
him
if
he
didn't
do
it
saying,
we'll,
i
didn't
do
it.
but
if
--
they're
very
careful
not
to
say
that
and
they
have
never
said
it.
why
he
took
--
he
took
checks
made
out
to
his
wife
and
there
was
a
forged
signature
on
her
checks.
and
he
deposited
them
and
in
his
own
account.
that's
where
he
got
the
$44,000.00
from
and
they
were
separated.
he
and
his
wife
were
separated.
she
lived
in
puerto
rico.
she
testified
under
oath.
she
hadn't
done
any
work
for
his
congressional
staff
since
1965
which
started
the
period
that
the
$44,000.00.
she
was
paid
at
his
instigation
over
$20,000.00
a
year.
never
did
a
thing
and
each
month,
the
check
with
the
forged
endorsement
in
her
name
ended
up
in
his
bank
account.
and
not
only
that,
he
authorized
according
to
the
testimony
of
his
assistant
stone,
the
illegal
and
deceitful
use
of
credit
cards
issued
to
employees
of
his
committee
for
friends
and
family
to
travel
in
europe,
to
florida,
to
the
bahamas
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
it's
a
crime
and
he
should
have
been
indicted.
i
don't
know
why
he
wasn't.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes.
well,
i
don't
know
if
there's
been
any
better
place
to
tried
at
mr.
justice
black,
since
he
plainly
admitted
it,
there
was
no
doubt
about
it.
he'd
been
indicted
he'd
probably
would
have
to
plead
guilty.
i
don't
understand
why
he
wasn't.
the
jury,
the
grand
jury
by
the
way
to
whom
my
friend
referred,
never
voted
no
true
bill.
it
never
did
anything
and
the
department
of
justice
all
fit
to
terminate
its
existence
before
it
took
any
action.
but
the
matter
of
whether
he
similarly
liable
it's
still
pending
somewhere
in
the
department.
so
finally,
i
say
again
that
for
anyone
that
he
seeks
legal
reasons,
i
think
this
matter
deserves
affirmance
and
i
believe
it
to
be
no
answer
to
any
of
those
arguments
to
say
that
the
house
might
unreasonably
or
erroneously
exercise
its
adjudicatory
powers.
for
members
of
the
house
like
judges
take
an
oath
to
support
the
constitution
we
can't
assume
that
they
will
violate
the
oath.
of
course,
there's
always
the
risk
of
error,
even
constitutional
error
on
the
part
of
each
branch
of
government
in
the
areas
in
which
it
is
granted
supreme
constitutional
competence.
but
this
is
not
a
weakness
of
our
system
of
government.
i
think
it's
a
strength
because
some
individual
or
some
group
always
has
to
make
the
final
decision
and
our
finding
fathers
put
this
narrow
area
of
adjudication
not
in
the
hands
of
an
article
iii
court
but
in
the
hands
of
an
article
i
legislative
body
there's
a
remedy
for
a
situation
like
this,
of
course,
but
it's
a
political
remedy.
so
quickly
exercise
by
the
voters
in
this
case.
and
if
he,
mr.
powell
had
presented
himself
a
month
or
two
after
he
was
excluded
since
he
was
overwhelmingly
re-elected.
in
the
light
of
the
speaker's
ruling
that
the
house
would
reconsider
the
matter
in
the
light
of
that
important
development.
he
probably
would
have
been
seated.
he
chose
to
wait.
i
don't
know
why.
mr.
bruce
bromley
because
the
voters
so
overwhelmingly
express
their
preference
to
him
of
this.
his
opponents
practically
got
no
votes.
despite
--
despite
all
the
publicity
attended
upon
is
there
elections
and
of
course
the
house
would
consider
that
that
was
a
very
important
matter
when
they
did
consider
it
last
january.
they
voted
to
seat
him,
surely.
they
thought,
look,
we
can't
let
this
man
go
scot-free.
we
will
punish
him
and
they
did
strip
him
of
his
seniority
and
fining
$25,000.00
which
he
got
to
pay
$1,100.00
a
month
out
of
his
salary.
mr.
bruce
bromley
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
bromley
i
don't
see
the
difference,
sir,
fining
him
from
misappropriating
money
making
him
pay
it
back
in
part.
i
think
it
was
a
very
mild
sanction
myself.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes.
mr.
bruce
bromley
or
disorderly
behavior,
they
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
have
the
power
to
punish
the
member
for
disorderly
behavior.
mr.
bruce
bromley
i
assume
that
mean
i
can
have
him
imprison.
mr.
bruce
bromley
that
is
my
position.
yes,
sir.
as
professor
zechariah
chafee
said
long
ago,
it
is
no
answer
to
say
that
if
the
house
should
exclude
the
man
on
some
whimsical
ground,
no
appeal
would
lie
from
its
action,
neither
is
there
any
appeal
from
the
supreme
court.
mr.
bruce
bromley
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
yes,
please.
they
â€“
there
are
at
least
four
undisputed
matters
before
us
to
which
my
two
friends
have
made
scant
attention.
first
as
this
court
is
fully
aware,
this
is
an
action
against
the
members
of
the
house
questioning
their
action
in
there
official
capacity
as
petitioners
emphatic
announce
below.
here,
we
are
suing
the
legislative
branch.
this
action
then
is
not
an
action
against
private
parties
or
against
the
united
states
with
its
consent
to
secure
the
declaration
of
unconstitutionality
of
a
statute
passed
by
the
congress.
it
is
directed
solely
to
the
members
in
their
capacity
as
members
of
the
house
and
three
of
their
agents
who
acted
within
the
house
pursuant
to
the
command
of
the
house.
it
is
our
view
that
this
court
does
not
have
the
power
to
entertain
this
action
against
the
members
any
more
than
it
would
have
the
power
to
order
the
members
to
pass
or
repeal
a
statute.
second,
there
is
no
dispute
now
as
to
the
correctness
of
the
findings
made
by
the
select
committee
of
the
90th
congress.
to
the
effect
that
mr.
powell
misappropriated
large
sums
of
government
funds
that
he
was
in
civil
and
criminal
contempt
at
the
time
of
the
action
of
the
new
york
courts.
that
he
maintained
unlawfully
an
improper
person
on
his
congressional
payroll
and
that
he
refused
to
cooperate
in
a
perfectly
proper
investigation
of
his
conduct,
conducted
by
two
committees,
one
of
the
89th
congress
and
one
of
the
90th.
now,
the
serious
charges
against
mr.
powell
were
not
denied
by
him
at
any
time.
they
were
not
denied
by
him
before
the
committees
which
investigated
him.
they
were
not
denied
by
him
at
the
time
the
house
convened.
now,
considered
the
matter
and
reach
its
decision.
they
were
not
denied
by
him
in
the
compliant
which
was
filed
two
years
ago.
they
were
not
denied
by
him
in
the
lower
courts
below
--
in
the
courts
below
and
they
are
not
denied
here.
mr.
bruce
bromley
no,
your
honor.
it
is
not.
mr.
bruce
bromley
no,
that's
not
right
sir.
mr.
bruce
bromley
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
they
said
that
probably
but
if
they
did
it's
not
correct.
mr.
bruce
bromley
now
third,
the
complaint
in
this
case
does
not
allege
that
mr.
powell
was
excluded
because
of
his
race
and
the
record
before
the
house
when
it
came
to
reach
its
decision
of
expulsion.
it
does
not
even
suggest
that
such
an
allegation
would
be
supported.
accordingly,
i
say
it
has
no
proper
place
in
this
case.
fourthly,
the
action
of
the
house
of
the
91st
congress,
the
present
congress
in
fining
mr.
powell
$25,000.00
and
depriving
him
of
his
seniority,
likewise,
is
not
before
this
court.
the
action
of
the
91st
house
is
not
challenged
in
the
compliant.
the
parties
to
any
such
claim
that
is
the
members
of
the
present
congress
and
their
agents
are
not
parties
to
this
action
in
their
capacity
as
members
of
this
congress.
the
moreover,
this
court
i
submit
it
does
not
have
original
jurisdiction
to
hear
any
such
claim.
and
so,
the
precise
question
as
we
see
it
is
whether
any
court
in
a
suit
against
the
members
of
the
house
of
the
90th
congress
can
review
a
decision
of
those
members
acting
pursuant
to
their
constitutional
powers
to
judge
the
qualifications
of
their
own
members
to
exclude
the
member
elect
solely
for
reasons
of
personal
misconduct
and
that's
all
mr.
powell
was
excluded
for
here.
mr.
bruce
bromley
i
should
say
sir
in
answer
to
that
question
of
action
of
the
house
would
be
clearly
unconstitutional.
mr.
bruce
bromley
but
as
i
read
the
speech
or
debate
clause
he
would
not
sir.
so,
our
position
is
that
what
the
house
did
in
this
matter
was
for
the
house
on
the
house
alone
to
decide
and
its
action
should
not
and
is
not
subject
to
judicial
review.
before
discussing
however
the
reasons
for
that
answer,
i
wish
to
emphasize
again
as
we
do
in
our
suggestion
of
mootness
and
in
our
brief
that
in
my
judgment
that
this
action
is
clearly
moot.
the
house
of
the
90th
congress
against
which
relief
is
sought
as
terminate.
mr.
powell
can
no
longer
be
seated
in
that
house.
there
is
now
a
new
house.
he
now
seats
in
that
house
and
i
believe
for
that
reason
in
that
simple
reason,
the
case
is
moot.
but
it
is
my
purpose
to
devote
the
remainder
of
my
time
to
the
substantive
issue.
mr.
bruce
bromley
back
salary
is
so
incidental
to
the
main
prayer
for
relief
that
i
do
not
feel
it
could
justify
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
it
is
completely
de
minimis.
he
was
paid
up
to
march
1,
1967,
the
date
on
which
he
was
expelled.
he
was
re-elected
very
promptly
and
he
could
have
prevented
himself
to
the
house
in
april
of
the
same
year.
and
as
the
speaker
said,
twice
the
matter
would
be
considered
again
in
light
of
the
very
important
new
factor
that
he
had
been
re-elected
as
it
was
last
january
but
mr.
powell
chose
to
stay
away.
he
never
presented
himself.
he
never
came
near
the
house.
so,
i
say
he
clearly
has
no
claim
for
any
salary
except
maybe
a
month's
salary.
mr.
bruce
bromley
no,
your
honor.
it
would
not.
mr.
bruce
bromley
because
in
the
first
place,
the
salary
can't
be
paid
unless
the
oath
is
administered.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
i
think
this
court
would
have
no
jurisdiction
against
the
sergeant
of
the
--
and
the
relief
would
have
to
be
against
the
sergeant
ordering
him
to
pay
when
he
is
prohibited
by
statute
from
doing
it.
mr.
bruce
bromley
i
certainly
would
sir.
and
in
that
court,
the
united
states
should
have
the
opportunity
which
it
might
be
very
well
seize
of
pleading
a
counterclaim
were
a
set
off
for
the
50
or
so
thousand
dollars
of
its
funds
which
mr.
powell
had
taken
unlawfully.
mr.
bruce
bromley
well,
it's
moot
now
so
you
couldn't
have
a
declaratory
judgment.
but
if
you
could
and
i
don't
think
you
could
have
one
anyway.
i
don't
think
the
action
would
foreclose
it
but
i
don't
think
this
court
should
grant
a
declaratory
judgment
whether
that
matter
is
in
the
court
of
claims
or
whether
it
isn't.
mr.
bruce
bromley
i
think
so
clearly
sir.
mr.
bruce
bromley
because
he's
been
seated.
you
--
nothing
you
can
do
about
the
90th
congress,
i
respectfully
submit.
it's
gone.
you
can't
seat
him
in
that
congress
and
that
the
present
congress
is
the
one
in
which
he
has
been
seated.
and
that
action
the
propriety
of
the
fine
which
he
got
and
the
laws
of
seniority
which
he
got
in
company
with
his
seating
is
not
attack
in
the
complaint,
and
it
is
not
here.
mr.
bruce
bromley
not
if
he
proceeded
promptly,
it
wouldn't
be.
mr.
bruce
bromley
no,
i
didn't
say
he
was
paid.
he
was
paid
up
to
march
1,
1967
when
he
was
excluded.
mr.
bruce
bromley
by
resolution
of
the
house.
that
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
that's
right.
the
resolution
said
he
should
be
paid
while
the
hearings
were
going
on
and
up
to
his
date
of
--
up
to
the
date
of
decision.
mr.
bruce
bromley
of
course,
my
point
about
the
salary
is
after
he
was
paid
the
march
1st,
he
could
have
come
back
and
the
result
might
have
been
entirely
different
as
it
was
last
january.
the
reason
he
didn't
get
his
salary
after
april
1967
until
january
1969
was
because
he
never
presented
himself.
he
never
asked
the
house
to
reconsider
in
the
light
of
the
important
fact
that
he
had
been
overwhelmingly
re-elected
in
harlem.
now,
i
submit
that
there
are
at
least
five
separate
reasons
why
his
demands
for
relief
cannot
be
granted
and
i'd
like
to
summarize
them
briefly
before
i
start
to
discuss
it.
in
the
first
place,
although,
we
haven't
heard
any
mention
of
it.
article
i
section
5,
the
speech
or
debate
clause
affirmatively
barged
any
court
from
questioning
members
of
the
house
or
their
agents
with
respect
to
actions
taken
by
them
within
the
house
such
as
the
exercise
of
their
constitutional
power
to
judge
the
qualifications
of
one
of
their
members.
second,
i
don't
think
federal
courts
have
any
subject
matter
jurisdiction
here
because
article
i
section
5
assigns
the
sole
adjudicatory
power
to
the
house
by
declaring
that
the
house
is
the
judge
of
the
qualifications
of
its
members.
that
delegation
of
judicial
power
under
article
i,
like
the
power
of
the
trial
impeachment
if
you
please
is
an
explicit
exception
to
the
general
grant
of
judicial
power
to
the
courts
under
article
iii.
since
the
legislative
is
co-equal
with
the
judicial
branch,
the
judgments
which
the
house
makes
in
this
situation
in
the
field
allocated
to
it,
i.e.
the
qualification
of
its
members
are
exclusive
and
supreme.
thirdly,
the
court
should
not
proceed
in
this
case
because
it
involves
a
nonjusticiable
political
question.
fourthly,
if
the
courts
could
review
the
propriety
what
the
house
did.
it
is
clear
that
the
house
acted
within
its
constitutional
powers
when
it
excluded
mr.
powell.
but
the
constitutional
power
of
each
house,
the
judge
qualifications
is
not
limited
as
had
has
been
stated
so
many
times
here
to
the
three
standing
disqualifications
of
age,
citizenship,
and
inhabitancy.
it
extends
as
well
to
matters
of
personal
misconduct
on
the
fitting
a
member
of
the
house
and
even
three
--
if
these
three
standing
disqualifications
were
exclusive,
the
house's
action
in
any
event
would
be
justified
under
its
expulsion
power.
since
the
two-thirds
vote
required
for
expulsion
was
obtained.
and
fifthly,
assuming
that
the
lower
federal
courts
did
have
the
power
to
rule
on
the
merits
of
the
case,
under
the
circumstances
presented
here,
those
courts
did
not
abuse
their
discretion
in
declining
to
grant
the
extraordinary
and
discretionary
relief
prayed
for.
now,
i
submit
that
anyone
of
these
five
reasons
is
sufficient
to
require
dismissal
of
the
action.
mr.
bruce
bromley
i
think
so,
of
course
it
was
improper
and
unconstitutional.
mr.
bruce
bromley
no
relief
because
the
power
to
judge
which
includes
the
power
to
judge
erroneously
has
been
confided
to
the
house.
mr.
bruce
bromley
no.
i
wouldn't
contest
that.
mr.
bruce
bromley
it's
correct.
yes,
but
outside
the
house
but
not
for
action
in
pursuant
to
its
adjudicatory
constitutional
power
to
act
within
the
house.
mr.
bruce
bromley
but
if
kilbourn
against
thompson
certainly
that
action
didn't
take
place
within
the
house.
the
witness
would
seize
outside
the
house.
mr.
bruce
bromley
true
that
there
were
some
authorization
within
the
house
that
they
act
which
the
courts
had
jurisdiction
of
was
the
seizure
outside
the
house
and
i
think
that
distinction,
however,
artificial
it
may
seem
is
one
which
is
dictated
by
the
allocation
through
the
power
to
judge
the
qualifications
of
its
members,
power
to
make
its
own
rules
of
its
proceedings,
and
the
bar
which
is
set
up
against
attack
in
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
mr.
bruce
bromley
no,
sir.
i
would
not
but
i
think
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
it
would
reside
in
this
court,
in
spite
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
mr.
bruce
bromley
well,
it's
a
harder
case
but
that
might
be
first
place
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
well,
i
think
it
is
because
of
your
remark
about
other
perversions
in
bond
against
floyd
there
--
i
must
admit
there
are
some
perversions
which
this
court
must
be
ingenious
enough
to
find
a
way
around
the
speech
or
debate
clause
or
else
will
be
confronted
with
revolution
or
worse.
so,
i
don't
say
that
the
other
perversions
which
this
maybe
and
lastly,
this
maybe
an
attempt
by
a
congress
to
add
another
standing
disqualification
which
it
has
no
power
to
do
and
which
i
don't
think
could
be
attacked
if
it
tried
to
do
it
to
cause
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
mr.
bruce
bromley
i
think
somebody's
got
to
draw
the
lines
somewhere.
mr.
bruce
bromley
the
house
draws
that
line
sir.
mr.
bruce
bromley
except
in
cases
of
under
perversions,
sir.
mr.
bruce
bromley
in
my
opinion
it
would
not
sir,
although,
clearly
unconstitutional,
clearly
improper.
now,
very
little
has
been
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
well,
a
great
many
things.
mr.
bruce
bromley
seizing
the
president
and
dragging
him
in
to
the
well
of
the
house
under
a
resolution
that
he
be
beheaded.
mr.
bruce
bromley
he
isn't
seeking
a
place.
no,
i'm
talking
about
house
action
which
constitutes
another
perversion
of
its
function.
mr.
bruce
bromley
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
recognize
that
it
has
a
strange
sound
coming
from
any
lawyer
to
tell
this
court
that
something
unconstitutional
may
have
occurred
and
yet
you
have
no
power
to
intervene.
but
i've
--
i
make
that
contention
in
this
posture
and
i
rest
it
squarely
on
the
speech
or
debate
clause
as
interpreted
by
at
least
three
cases
decided
here
under
that
clause.
but
that
clause
providing
that
for
any
speech
or
debate
in
the
house,
its
members
shall
not
be
questioned
at
any
place
underscores
and
enforces
the
separation
of
power
doctrine
embedded
in
our
constitution.
it
has
the
broad
purpose,
i
submit
of
protecting
the
integrity
and
independence
of
the
federal
legislative
branch
from
any
interference
whatsoever
by
the
executive
or
judicial
branches
even
to
the
extent
of
imposing
upon
the
members
the
inconvenience
and
expense
of
defending
themselves.
no
longer
is
there
--
does
anyone
question
the
fact
that
speech
or
debate
is
not
limited
to
words
spoken
in
debate
in
the
house
but
includes
everything
done
in
the
house
in
connection
with
its
business
such
as
the
act
of
holding
the
passage
of
a
resolution
directing
the
activities
of
its
agents
and
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
because
it's
confined
only,
your
honor,
to
the
action
which
the
members
take
in
connection
with
the
regulation
of
their
own
proceedings
within
the
house.
and
mind
you,
that's
why
i
emphasized
at
the
outset
in
the
suit
against
the
members.
it
doesn't
officiate
a
broad
area
at
all
sir,
it
only
vitiates
a
very
narrow
area.
now
the
three
cases
that
i
mention,
this
immunity
from
attacked
put
up
with
the
speech
or
debate
clause
covers,
well,
let's
take
kilbourn
against
thompson
first.
that
involves
the
passage
of
a
resolution
directing
the
illegal
and
unconstitutional
incarceration
imprisonment
of
a
private
individual
sued
against
the
members
barred
by
speech
or
debate
even
though
their
action
was
clearly
unconstitutional.
the
alleged
unlawful
and
unconstitutional
activity
of
seizing
private
property
in
the
context
of
an
effort
to
suppress
free
speech,
last
terms
dombrowski
against
eastland.
and
finally,
activity
which
results
in
the
clear
violation
of
a
criminal
statute,
united
states
against
johnson,
the
only
possible
limitation
as
i
said
before
on
the
speech
or
debate
clause
is
what
this
court
said
in
kilbourn.
and
what
it
described
as
possible
other
perversions
and
the
example
that
i
gave
of
the
heading
the
precedent
was
given
by
this
court
in
the
opinion
in
kilbourn
as
an
example
of
an
utter
perversion,
i
didn't
make
it
up.
now,
what
other
cases
would
be
included
in
this
doctrine
of
other
perversion?
well,
that's
a
very
difficult
question
but
i
am
willing
to
say
i
think
but
what
its
worth
that
probably
if
all
blacks
were
excluded
in
any
fashion
either
seriatim
or
by
the
passage
of
a
rule
that
would
be
an
utter
perversion
possibly.
i'm
sure
if
all
republicans
were
excluded
it
would
clearly
be
an
utter
perversion.
but
i
say
probably
not
if
only
one
will
act
were
excluded
such
as
here
assuming
contrary
to
the
fact
that
mr.
powell
was
excluded
because
of
his
race.
he'd
probably
not
give
if
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
sir?
mr.
bruce
bromley
ten
blacks.
well,
10
at
one
time.
mr.
bruce
bromley
i
take
it
my
way.
mr.
bruce
bromley
well,
10
at
one
time
and
if
there
are
only
10
in
the
house
i
can't
tell
you.
i
don't
know.
maybe
we
could
get
some
help
if
we
took
the
analogy
of
impeachment.
suppose
the
president
were
impeached
on
unconstitutional
grounds
of
race,
religion,
or
speech
and
removed
from
office
by
the
senate.
i
say
this
court
could
do
nothing
about
it
in
a
suit
against
members
of
the
senate
because
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
and
the
fact
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
i
was
about
to
say
and
because
i
think
as
well
the
fact
that
the
constitutional
lodges
the
ultimate
power
to
try
impeachments
in
the
senate
under
article
i
just
as
the
constitution
allocates
the
power
to
judge
the
qualifications
in
the
house
or
perhaps
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
oh!
no,
sir.
mr.
bruce
bromley
oh!
no,
sir.
it
states
--
it
states
three
or
more
standing
disqualifications
that
affect
the
class.
no
person
shall
be
a
representative
who
has
not
obtained
the
age
of
25
and
is
a
resident
citizen
of
state
court
he
comes.
i
think
that's
--
that's
a
standing
disqualification
and
doesn't
that
all
evidence
an
intent
on
the
part
of
the
framers
to
overrule
the
longstanding
power
of
legislative
bodies
for
over
two
centuries
to
discipline
their
own
members
for
personal
misconduct.
well,
that
goes
back
to
the
16th
century.
mr.
bruce
bromley
that's
a
fair
statement,
yes.
mr.
bruce
bromley
so,
long
as
we
qualify
it
by
understanding
that
my
contention
about
that
power
to
exclude
is
probably
limited
to
cases
of
misconduct
unbefitting
the
trust
and
confidence
that
ought
to
be
placed
in
the
member.
mr.
bruce
bromley
a
conduct.
mr.
bruce
bromley
something
for
the
house,
and
the
house
alone.
mr.
bruce
bromley
well
you
may,
i'm
not
sure
i
quite
understand
it
but
my
position
is
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
adopt
its
own
standards.
i
can't
adopt
any
additional
standing
disqualifications.
mr.
bruce
bromley
that
they
must
judge
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
i
know
it's
difficult.
mr.
bruce
bromley
but
the
--
i
might
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
under
speech
or
debate,
i
do
not
believe
so.
no,
sir.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
sir.
now,
that
i
must
repeat
even
though
i
know
it
may
bore
you.
these
questions
have
nothing
to
do
with
our
case.
there
was
nothing
unconstitutional
about
mr.
powell's
exclusion
once
you
agree
that
the
power
to
judge
the
qualifications
for
misconduct
is
lodge
in
the
house
as
i
think
is
perfectly
clear
by
the
practice
of
all
the
legislatures
and
our
congress
right
down
to
the
present
time.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
bromley
i
would
make
no
such
distinction
sir
and
there
are
many,
many
cases
of
the
legislative
practice
of
excluding
felons,
perjurers,
and
we
even
have
some
presidents
for
persons
who
had
been
contemptuous
of
the
court's
outside
the
house.
i
think
that
a
well-defined
legislative
common
law
that
came
along
with
this
speech
or
debate
clause
into
the
constitution.
well,
i
was
talking
about
impeachment
and
i
said
that
i
thought
that
was
an
analogy
because
the
speech
or
debate
clause
applied
to
impeachment,
even
though
it
was
on
at
utterly
unconstitutional
grounds.
now,
coming
to
this
contention
of
the
petitioners
for
a
moment,
as
i
understand
them
they
say,
well,
speech
or
debate
may
bar
the
imposition
of
criminal
or
civil
penalties
after
the
event.
but
it
doesn't
forbid
the
course
the
kind
of
relief
inherent
in
an
injunction
or
a
writ
or
declaratory
judgment.
however,
it
seems
to
us
that
in
order
to
effectuate
the
immunity
afforded
by
the
speech
or
debate
clause,
it
must
apply
to
injunction,
mandamus,
or
declaratory
judgment,
of
course,
it
is
far
simpler
to
intimidate
critical
legislators
by
direct
order
of
a
court
with
its
attention
--
attended
sanctions
than
it
is
by
the
indirect
threat
of
subsequent
criminal
or
civil
proceedings.
and
as
i've
indicated,
i
don't
believe
petitioners
have
overcome
their
difficulty
by
now
limiting
their
prayer
to
a
declaratory
judgment
because
the
declaratory
judgment
is
itself
i
submit
in
the
most
direct
and
positive
sense,
a
questioning
of
speech
or
debate
taken
in
the
house.
furthermore
in
this
situation,
i
think
there
should
be
a
doctrine
and
probably
is
that
declaratory
relief
should
not
lie
where
the
suit
for
injunction
is
barred
at
least
by
the
separation
of
power's
doctrine
as
it
is
here
for
unless
declaratory
judgment
is
to
feel
wholly
gratuitous
and
advisory,
and
useless
act.
it
must
rely
for
its
efficacy
upon
the
willingness
of
the
members
to
acquiesce
in
the
court's
interpretation
of
it's
--
of
the
house's
powers.
thus,
insofar
as
a
declaratory
judgment
would
be
given
force
and
effect
by
the
member
voluntary
acquiescence,
it
would
be,
i
submit
as
effective
and
impingement
and
interference
with
legislative
proceedings
as
a
flat
injunction
would
be.
i
want
to
say
a
word
about
nonmember
agents
because
in
the
dombrowski
against
eastland,
the
court
said
that
the
immunity
extends
to
the
sergeant
at
arms
in
this
case
to
the
clerk
and
the
doorkeeper
who
are
three
individual
defendants
in
this
matter.
and
this
court
said
the
immunity
extends
although
it
is
less
absolute.
but
it
seems
to
me,
of
course
there
the
agent
of
the
senate
mr.
sowerwine
was
held
not
protected
by
the
clause
because
he
is
alleged
to
have
conspired
down
in
louisiana
with
some
people
to
make
an
illegal
seizure
of
some
papers
which
senator
eastland
wanted.
here,
the
only
thing
that
these
three
gentlemen
did
was
to
obey
the
command
of
the
house
within
the
house
and
it
seems
to
me
the
immunity
therefore
clearly
applies
to
them.
i
want
to
say
a
word
about
power
to
judge
qualifications
and
the
power
to
expel.
let's
assume
for
a
moment
contrary
to
my
basic
position
that
this
court
may
properly
review
the
action
of
the
house
in
this
case.
i
nevertheless
say
that
the
action
of
the
house
in
doing
what
it
did
to
mr.
powell
was
clearly
within
its
constitutional
powers
for
it
clearly
was
within
the
constitutional
grant
in
my
view
of
the
power
to
judge
his
qualifications
to
seat
and
i
had
no
use
my
repeating
that
i
do
not
believe
this
constitutional
disqualifications
under
more
than
three
of
them
are
exclusive
in
all
that
the
framers
had
before
them
illustration
of
state
constitutions
which
made
this
matter
clear.
i
said
that
the
legislature
in
various
states
like
new
hampshire
and
massachusetts
had
the
power
to
judge
the
qualifications
contained
in
this
constitution
and
one
of
the
men
who
work
on
the
draft
of
the
constitution
came
from
massachusetts
or
new
hampshire
that
he
was
fully
familiar
with
his
own
constitution.
and
yet,
the
framers
chose
to
adopt
language
not
so
specifically
limited
and
the
reason
they
did
it
i
think
it's
because
they
new
fully
well
and
realize
and
all
that
to
retain
the
power
to
purged
themselves
of
dishonest,
disgraceful
people
because
of
the
obligation
they
owed
to
the
whole
nation
to
have
a
legislative
body
made
up
at
least
of
decent,
honorable
citizens.
mr.
bruce
bromley
they
fix
her
by
undoubted
practice
of
all
legislatures
that
control
there
own
disciplinary
matters
and
by
the
doctrine
that
the
legislatures
have
power
to
compel
--
over
their
internal
affairs
and
the
judge
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
oh!
no.
they
can't
--
i
don't
--
they
can't
constitutionally
add
to
the
standing
of
--
the
standing
disqualifications
contained
in
the
constitution.
they
can't
have
a
rule.
they
can't
adopt
the
res
--
our
rule
resolution
that
certain
classes,
people
who
do
not
posses
$50,000.00
worth
of
property
are
not
qualified
to
seat.
they
can't
do
that
that
would
unconstitutionally
add
to
the
provisions
of
the
constitution.
mr.
bruce
bromley
they
are
specified
in
the
constitution
the
three
that
i've
mentioned.
in
addition,
there
are
couple
more
person
who
can't
take
the
oath
of
loyalty
and
the
person
who
holds
the
federal
office.
mr.
bruce
bromley
he
complied
with
all
of
those.
yes.
mr.
bruce
bromley
they
are
not
any
expressed
in
the
constitution
except
as
his
residence
are
phrase
to
judge
the
qualifications
which
has
a
meaning
that
is
personal
conduct
is
a
qualification.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
i
do.
i
say
in
addition
to
following
those
expressed
in
the
constitution
under
the
power
to
judge
provision,
they
have
the
right
to
judge
whether
the
man's
character
and
action
is
that
it
is
worthy
of
a
member
there
body
or
whether
the
man
is
a
crook
and
ought
to
be
thrown
out.
and
i
say
that's
so
deeply
embedded
in
our
whole
system
that
i
really
don't
see
how
anybody
can
question
it.
mr.
bruce
bromley
well,
i
don't
think
your
cases
have
ever
had
occasion
to
consider
it.
however,
the
historical
matter
that
i
refer
going
back
centuries
is
contained
in
this
appendix
that
we
have
filed
with
the
court.
it's
more
blue-covered
doctrine
in
which
we
list
the
precedents
in
england,
in
the
american
colonies,
and
the
american
states.
at
great
length
showing
how
widespread
the
power
with
--
was
and
how
widely
it
was
exercise
what
the
grounds
were.

back
of
our
brief,
we
summarize
some
of
the
things
from
our
appendix,
mr.
whittemore
in
south
carolina
excluded
from
41st
congress
by
a
vote
for
selling
appointments
to
the
military
and
naval
academies.
now,
it
doesn't
say
whether
he
did
that
while
he
was
in
the
congress
at
least
the
summary
doesn't
or
before
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
he
got
there
but
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
mr.
bruce
bromley
not
a
bit.
mr.
bruce
bromley
not
a
bit.
because
if
he's
guilty
of
prior
misconduct
he's
just
about
as
unfit
to
seat
so
he
conduct
it
a
--
committed
the
same
impropriety
while
he
was
acting.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
he
has
the
same
rights.
mr.
bruce
bromley
oh!
surely.
mr.
bruce
bromley
surely,
if
the
congress
before
he
sworn
gives
him
that
right
which
it
did
here
by
resolution.
the
rules
of
the
house
gave
him
the
right
to
be
heard
and
they
offered
it
to
him.
they
offered
him
to
have
full
right
to
produce
witnesses
proceed
in
the
investigations
in
both
houses
to
appear
on
the
floor
with
his
counsel
to
make
any
statement
he
wanted
to.
he
never
showed
up.
he
boycotted
these
hearings
and
has
never
denied
the
factual
findings
which
were
resulted
from
these
hearings.
mr.
bruce
bromley
oh!
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes.
i
think
it's
a
pure
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
well
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
we
do
in
that
area.
furthermore,
we
cite
in
re
chapman
decided
by
this
court
in
which
the
court
affirmed
the
action
of
the
house
and
made
a
statement
that
the
offense
which
grounded
the
exclusion
was
not
a
statutory
offense.
it
was
not
committed
while
he
was
in
the
house
or
at
the
seat
of
government
or
not
even
during
a
session
and
it
negated
all
of
the
requirements
that
the
conduct
be
limited
to
his
conduct
while
he
was
in
the
house.
this
opinion
in
re
chapman
approve
the
case
of
william
blunt,
not
long
ago
in
1797
in
which
the
house
found
that
his
conduct,
although,
not
taking
place
during
the
time
of
his
service
was
nevertheless
a
proper
ground
for
expelling
or
excluding.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
it's
been
discussed.
mr.
bruce
bromley
they
never
reached
in
any
case
that
we
can
find
a
square
decision
on
that.
mr.
bruce
bromley
that's
right.
but
of
course,
you
understand
that
my
contention
is
that
a
matter
for
the
house
to
decide.
mr.
bruce
bromley
i
call
your
honor's
attention
to
page
19
(a)
of
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
our
brief,
where
we
list
a
summary
of
precedents
of
the
house
in
senate
regarding
exclusion
or
expulsion
on
grounds
other
than
the
three
standing
disqualifications.
mr.
bruce
bromley
contrary?
are
they?
mr.
bruce
bromley
oh!
yes.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes.
mr.
bruce
bromley
no.
no,
they
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
well,
the
house
is
never
--
the
house
itself
formally
never
thought
this
is
acting
on
an
expulsion
matter.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
but
isn't
that
the
distinction
since
there
was
a
two-thirds
vote.
absolutely
immaterial,
what
would
this
court
be
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
but
i
just
want
to
say
this
--
this
work
should
the
court
order
the
house
not
an
existence
to
go
back
and
seat
him
and
then
expel
him?
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
but
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
but
isn't
that
--
isn't
it
--
couldn't
they
clearly
distinguished
mr.
powell's
situation.
he
had
$50,000.00
which
he
taken.
he
had
it
through
--
he
took
it
prior
to
the
90th
congress
but
he
had
it
in
his
possession
at
the
time
the
90th
acted,
he
saw
no
reason
for
offering
to
give
it
back
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
with
the
what?
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes.
mr.
bruce
bromley
he
had
the
money,
yes.
and
the
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
well,
i
opted
a
little
or
defined
the
specific
finding
--
specific
findings
of
the
report,
say
that
he
willfully
and
unlawfully
appropriated
to
his
own
use.
there
are
two
findings,
25,000
add,
50,000
add,
16,000
add
and
you
add
them
up
and
they
come
to
over
$44,000.00.
mr.
bruce
bromley
well,
i
--
maybe
i
should
have
said
$44,892.02
mr.
bruce
bromley
all
i
said
was
that
he
never
offered
to
return
it.
the
government
never
got
it
back.
i
don't
know
what
he
did
with
it,
maybe
spend
it
but
we
didn't
give.
we
the
citizens
of
this
country
didn't
get
it
back.
in
addition
to
which,
there
were
many
other
improper
expenditures.
mr.
bruce
bromley
they
charged
--
they
found
that
he
misappropriated
their
finding
was
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
what?
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
sir.
i
suppose
that
was
crime.
mr.
bruce
bromley
it
might
be
embezzlement,
yes.
mr.
bruce
bromley
well,
he
wasn't
fined
in
the
90th
congress.
he
was
fined
in
the
present
congress
which
is
not
before
your
honors,
but
what
were
doing?
they
were
exercising
their
constitutional
power
to
punish
him.
mr.
bruce
bromley
that's
what
the
constitution
says.
mr.
bruce
bromley
well,
no
it's
just
says
to
punish
him.
mr.
bruce
bromley
perhaps
no.
no,
they
couldn't.
mr.
bruce
bromley
the
house
indicted
him.
mr.
bruce
bromley
well,
they
could
send
him
to
a
grand
jury
own
his
own.
mr.
bruce
bromley
that
was
the
91st
congress
which
isn't
before
you
and
before
a
judge
in
the
jury
he
admits
all
the
issue,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
bromley
why
not?
he's
never
denied
it,
never
disputed
it
at
any
time.
mr.
bruce
bromley
well,
i
should
think
in
this
posture
that
we
ought
to
come
here
with
some
statement
from
him
if
he
didn't
do
it
saying,
we'll,
i
didn't
do
it.
but
if
--
they're
very
careful
not
to
say
that
and
they
have
never
said
it.
why
he
took
--
he
took
checks
made
out
to
his
wife
and
there
was
a
forged
signature
on
her
checks.
and
he
deposited
them
and
in
his
own
account.
that's
where
he
got
the
$44,000.00
from
and
they
were
separated.
he
and
his
wife
were
separated.
she
lived
in
puerto
rico.
she
testified
under
oath.
she
hadn't
done
any
work
for
his
congressional
staff
since
1965
which
started
the
period
that
the
$44,000.00.
she
was
paid
at
his
instigation
over
$20,000.00
a
year.
never
did
a
thing
and
each
month,
the
check
with
the
forged
endorsement
in
her
name
ended
up
in
his
bank
account.
and
not
only
that,
he
authorized
according
to
the
testimony
of
his
assistant
stone,
the
illegal
and
deceitful
use
of
credit
cards
issued
to
employees
of
his
committee
for
friends
and
family
to
travel
in
europe,
to
florida,
to
the
bahamas
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes,
it's
a
crime
and
he
should
have
been
indicted.
i
don't
know
why
he
wasn't.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes.
well,
i
don't
know
if
there's
been
any
better
place
to
tried
at
mr.
justice
black,
since
he
plainly
admitted
it,
there
was
no
doubt
about
it.
he'd
been
indicted
he'd
probably
would
have
to
plead
guilty.
i
don't
understand
why
he
wasn't.
the
jury,
the
grand
jury
by
the
way
to
whom
my
friend
referred,
never
voted
no
true
bill.
it
never
did
anything
and
the
department
of
justice
all
fit
to
terminate
its
existence
before
it
took
any
action.
but
the
matter
of
whether
he
similarly
liable
it's
still
pending
somewhere
in
the
department.
so
finally,
i
say
again
that
for
anyone
that
he
seeks
legal
reasons,
i
think
this
matter
deserves
affirmance
and
i
believe
it
to
be
no
answer
to
any
of
those
arguments
to
say
that
the
house
might
unreasonably
or
erroneously
exercise
its
adjudicatory
powers.
for
members
of
the
house
like
judges
take
an
oath
to
support
the
constitution
we
can't
assume
that
they
will
violate
the
oath.
of
course,
there's
always
the
risk
of
error,
even
constitutional
error
on
the
part
of
each
branch
of
government
in
the
areas
in
which
it
is
granted
supreme
constitutional
competence.
but
this
is
not
a
weakness
of
our
system
of
government.
i
think
it's
a
strength
because
some
individual
or
some
group
always
has
to
make
the
final
decision
and
our
finding
fathers
put
this
narrow
area
of
adjudication
not
in
the
hands
of
an
article
iii
court
but
in
the
hands
of
an
article
i
legislative
body
there's
a
remedy
for
a
situation
like
this,
of
course,
but
it's
a
political
remedy.
so
quickly
exercise
by
the
voters
in
this
case.
and
if
he,
mr.
powell
had
presented
himself
a
month
or
two
after
he
was
excluded
since
he
was
overwhelmingly
re-elected.
in
the
light
of
the
speaker's
ruling
that
the
house
would
reconsider
the
matter
in
the
light
of
that
important
development.
he
probably
would
have
been
seated.
he
chose
to
wait.
i
don't
know
why.
mr.
bruce
bromley
because
the
voters
so
overwhelmingly
express
their
preference
to
him
of
this.
his
opponents
practically
got
no
votes.
despite
--
despite
all
the
publicity
attended
upon
is
there
elections
and
of
course
the
house
would
consider
that
that
was
a
very
important
matter
when
they
did
consider
it
last
january.
they
voted
to
seat
him,
surely.
they
thought,
look,
we
can't
let
this
man
go
scot-free.
we
will
punish
him
and
they
did
strip
him
of
his
seniority
and
fining
$25,000.00
which
he
got
to
pay
$1,100.00
a
month
out
of
his
salary.
mr.
bruce
bromley
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
bromley
i
don't
see
the
difference,
sir,
fining
him
from
misappropriating
money
making
him
pay
it
back
in
part.
i
think
it
was
a
very
mild
sanction
myself.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes.
mr.
bruce
bromley
or
disorderly
behavior,
they
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
have
the
power
to
punish
the
member
for
disorderly
behavior.
mr.
bruce
bromley
i
assume
that
mean
i
can
have
him
imprison.
mr.
bruce
bromley
that
is
my
position.
yes,
sir.
as
professor
zechariah
chafee
said
long
ago,
it
is
no
answer
to
say
that
if
the
house
should
exclude
the
man
on
some
whimsical
ground,
no
appeal
would
lie
from
its
action,
neither
is
there
any
appeal
from
the
supreme
court.
