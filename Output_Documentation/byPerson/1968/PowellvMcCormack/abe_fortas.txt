justice
abe
fortas
what's
the
basis
of
that
statement
professor
reid
that
the
house
could
not
expel
for
conduct
in
previous
session?
justice
abe
fortas
the
adversary
in
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
that
the
house
determine
in
whatever
way
that
a
member
had
misappropriated
house
funds
in
a
substantial
amount.
and
suppose
that
this
determination
occur
and
the
misappropriation
had
occurred
during
the
same
session,
do
you
challenge
that
the
house
could
expel
him?
justice
abe
fortas
well
i
want
to
be
sure
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
position.
you
wouldn't
say
them
that
the
house
could
constitutionally
expel
the
member
after
a
due
process
hearing
for
the
misappropriation
of
house
funds
and
i
assume
that
it
was
everything
happen
during
the
single
session.
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
can
expel
one
person
for
misappropriation
of
house
funds
unless
you
expel
everybody?
justice
abe
fortas
1969
resolution
is
not
before
us,
is
it
for
--
justice
abe
fortas
adjudication?
justice
abe
fortas
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
there
is
a
difference
between
taking
notice
of
that
for
whatever
bearing
it
may
have
on
the
mootness
question
and
our
granting
relief
because
that
has
not
been
adjudicated
in
the
lower
courts,
has
it?
justice
abe
fortas
what--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
suppose
it
were
--
suppose
it
were
12
months'
salary,
judge
bromley,
would
that
save
the
case
from
being
moot
in
your
judgment?
justice
abe
fortas
why
not?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
no,
no,
i'm
talking
about
--
i
see
what
you
mean.
you
mean
that
because
the
salary
can't
--
couldn't
be
paid
that
the
courts
would
have
no
jurisdiction
even
if,
they
were
wrongfully
withheld.
and
the
oath
wrong
--
wrongfully
withheld?
justice
abe
fortas
but
would
a
remedy
in
the
court
of
claims
foreclose
a
declaratory
judgment
action
in
the
federal
district
court
for
salary?
justice
abe
fortas
but
would
you
contest,
i
beg
your
pardon.
would
you
then
contest
the
judicial
power
to
review
and
whatever
procedure
it
might
be
in
action
by
the
house
holding
a
nonmember
in
contempt?
justice
abe
fortas
so,
there
are
some
instances
where
action
by
the
house
maybe
subjective
to
judicial
review?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
don't
understand.
both
actions
take
place
within
the
house.
justice
abe
fortas
but
you
have
said
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
in
response
to
justice
black
i
take
it
an
exclusion
solely
on
the
grounds
of
rights
would
not
be
within
--
would
not
be
within
the
category
of
other
perversions
as
you
see
it.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
powell
led
to
its
logic
conclusion
why
doesn't
that
vitiate
the
whole
part
of
the
initial
review?
justice
abe
fortas
how
about
10?
justice
abe
fortas
how
about
10
judge
bromley?
suppose
10
blacks
were
excluded?
justice
abe
fortas
what
else
take?
you
take
it
your
way.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
really
saying
judge
bromley,
if
i
correctly
understand
you
is
that
the
constitution
has
these
grounds
of
disqualification.
the
constitution
provides
that
the
house
shall
be
the
judge
of
the
qualifications
of
its
member
that
the
house
may
take
whatever
standard
it
wants
to
for
necessary
qua
--
as
a
necessary
qualification
of
member
--
of
the
member
provided
that
it
is
not
so
extremely
outrageous,
is
that
about
it?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
your
position?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
now
that's
a
different
matter
because
if
you're
going
to
narrow
it
down
to
qualifications
unbefitting
a
member,
unbefitting
a
member.
justice
abe
fortas
well
now
is
that
something
for
the
house
to
decide
whether
the
particular
basis
for
exclusion
is
an
appropriate
basis
within
that
standard
or
is
it
that
subject
to
judicial
review?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
you
get
back
to
my
statement
of
it
rather
than
your
qualification
of
it,
don't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
what
i
mean
to
say
is
that,
if
i
correctly
understand
your
last
statement.
you're
saying
that
there
is
--
that
the
house
may
adopt
its
own
standards
as
to
what
are
requisite
qualifications
in
members
within
the
subject
to
only
one
limitation
and
that
is
as
perversion
or
whatever
correct
words
of
it,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
think
i
assume
--
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
trying
to
understand
your
position.
justice
abe
fortas
it
is.
yes,
it
is
judge.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
want
to
ask
you
one
more
question.
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
in
that
respect,
would
you
make
any
distinction
between
the
grounds
for
exclusion
which
relate
to
his
activities
as
a
member
of
the
house
that
is
to
say
the
allege
misappropriation
of
funds,
the
allege
contumacious
conduct,
the
alleged
improper
payroll
practice,
would
you
make
a
distinction
between
those
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
hand
alleged
improper
conduct
that
had
no
bearing
upon
the
business
of
the
house
but
related
the
allegedly
to
mr.
powell's
character
and
his
obedience
to
law,
namely
the
contumacious
conduct
towards
a
court?
justice
abe
fortas
would
they
have
had
the
power
to
order
to
commit
him
to
prison?
justice
abe
fortas
under
the
expel
clause
in
the
constitution?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
it
says.
justice
abe
fortas
and
in
that
event
would
he
been
entitled
to
--
it
is
your
position
that
he
would
not
be
entitled
any
judicial
review?
justice
abe
fortas
if
they
--
justice
abe
fortas
if
the
petitioner
had
been
seated,
there's
no
doubt
is
there
that
the
house
would
have
had
power
to
punish
him
if
it
had
so
concluded
so
to
do
under
the
specific
provision
in
the
constitution.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
in
theory
that
constitutional
power
is
clear?
justice
abe
fortas
and
so
that
if
the
--
a
proceeding
to
punish
him
had
been
brought
in
the
same
session
of
congress
in
which
allegedly
acts,
these
acts
were
committed.
i'm
talking
about
the
acts
relating
to
congressional
funds.
there
would
have
been
no
question
as
to
the
power
of
the
house
to
punish
subject
to
judicial
review
or
not
subject
to
judicial
review
as
it
might
turn
out,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
also
there
had
been
no
question
as
to
power
of
the
house
and
in
appropriate
case
and
by
whatever
procedure
may
be
appropriate
to
expel
a
member,
is
there?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
to
considerable
extent
in
a
way,
your
submission
to
us
depends
in
the
first
instance
upon
the
distinction
between
the
exclusion
and
the
expulsion
procedures
or
the
exclusion
and
the
punishment
procedures.
justice
abe
fortas
oh!
you're
--
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
house
can
expel
only
because
of
the
lack
of
these
three
specific
called
cases?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
why
do
you
--
i've
read
your
brief
on
the
point
that
--
perhaps
you'd
tell
--
tell
me
briefly,
quickly
now
why
you
say
that
you
have
to
take
this
problem
session
by
session
of
the
congress
or
congress
by
congress?
that
is
to
say
that
congress
--
you're
position
isn't
congress
could
not
punish
or
expel
for
“x”,
let's
say
disorderly
behavior
occurring
in
the
preceding
congress
by
the
same
member?
justice
abe
fortas
and
why
is
that?
justice
abe
fortas
what's
the
basis
of
