justice
byron
r.
white
and
we
do,
i
understand
you
then
that
your
position
now
is
that
all
that
you
seek
is
the
declaratory
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
what?
what
injunctive
relief
are
you
with?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
in
--
is
that
a
separate
resolution?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
effect
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that
sounds
to
me
that
you'd
be
content
with
just
the
declaratory
judgment
that
resolution
278
was
unconstitutional,
is
that
what
you're
telling?
justice
byron
r.
white
judge
bromley,
excuse
me.
i
take
it
then
you
do
rely
on
also
on
the
argument
that
this
might
be
viewed
as
an
expulsion?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
two-thirds
vote
requirements
satisfied.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
in
looking
through
your
brief,
i
see
only
on
page
94,
95
where
you
deal
with
the
expulsion
and
that
i
don't
--
not
sure
that
you
address
yourself
specifically
to
whether
or
not
the
house
may
expel
or
conduct
occurring
before
the
member
becomes
a
member.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
deal
--
do
you
anywhere
deal
with
the
precedents
of
the
house
to
just
means?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
the
house
itself
ever
adjust
itself
to
this
matter?
in
its
own
cases
in
so
much
its
expulsion
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
has
been
the
judgment
of
the
house
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
the
--
you
have
no
precedents
for
the
house
itself
would
still
for
conduct
prior
to
the
--
that
term
of
the
house?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
appendix?
justice
byron
r.
white
judge
bromley,
are
we
--
we
do
attach
any
significance
to
the
conclusions
of
the
select
committee,
its
apparently
contrary
of
the
decision
that
you
take?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
question
of
whether
they
may
expel
for
conduct
occurring
before?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
committee
wasn't
concurring.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
we
to
attach
in
this
significance
to
thereafter?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
a
legal
conclusion
which
no
matter
what
the
recommendation
of
the
report
letter
was
decided
as
a
legal
matter
by
the
house
on
march
1st
and
they
did
not
accept
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
speaker
right,
i
thought
the
speaker
put
an
as
exclusion
matter?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
that's
the
question
were
investigating
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
the
house
that
the
--
that
in
the
precedents
of
the
house
it
was
pretty
clear
that
the
house
had
always
sought
it,
it
could
never
expel
for
conduct
occurring
prior
to
the
organizing
of
the
house?
i
suppose
that
would
be
at
some
--
justice
byron
r.
white
varying
reasons
in
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
he
came
into
the
house
with
the
status?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
sort
of
like
he
came
into
the
house
with
the
status?
in
the
sense
that
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
his
conduct
continued
into
that
house.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
had
the
money.

what?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
kinoy.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
get
something
straight
here,
did
the
speaker
of
the
house
in
1967,
was
that
when
the
exclusion
took
place?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
i
understand
that.
but
did
he
at
that
time
say
refer
to
anything
at
all
about
expulsion?
except
to
say
it
was
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
didn't
so
it
was
only
in
1969
that
he
referred
to
the
precedents
then
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
fact
is
that
in
this
case
you
would
say
that
it
--
that
the
representative
powell
could
not
have
been
expelled
for
the
conduct
that's
involved
in
this
case.
