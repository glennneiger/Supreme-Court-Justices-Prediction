mr.
arthur
kinoy
were
wholly
unsupported
by
the
facts
themselves.
they’ve
talked
of
willful
contemptuous
a
conduct
in
the
part
of
the
petitioner
towards
the
courts
of
the
state
new
york,
and
on
april
11th
of
this
year,
the
appellate
division
of
this
court’s
to
state
of
new
york,
revoked,
resented,
and
vacated
the
judgment
of
criminal
contempt
against
the
petitioner.
they
talked
of
alleged
improper
use
of
committee
funds
and
yet,
mr.
hayes,
himself
the
chairman
of
the
committee
which
had
previously
investigate
said
on
the
floor
of
the
house,
in
supporting
the
admission
of
the
petitioner
without
any
qualifications
this
time,
he
pointed
out
that
when
these
supposed
facts
were
submitted
to
a
tribunal
which
has
the
power
to
investigate
a
grand
jury,
the
grand
jury
refused
to
return
any
bill
of
indictment
whatsoever.
this
illustrates
the
profundity
of
the
founder’s
insistence
that
this
rock
of
protection
be
written.
now,
the
respondents
have
a
great
difficulty
with
this
constitutional
of
analysis.
they
have
difficulty
with
the
writings
and
thinking
of
professor
warren,
who
after
lifetime
scholarly
expertise
came
to
the
conclusions
which
we
have
here
advanced.
did
they
suggest
that
professor
warren
through
his
lifetime
of
experience
did
not
have
the
same
time
to
examine
the
sources
of
history
which
turns
this
to
the
respondents
that
had.
we
don't
have
to
pause
long
on
this.
this
court
has
time
and
time
again
relied
only
in
bond
against
floyd
on
the
expertise
of
professor
warren.
think
of
difficulty
with
madison
and
hamilton
and
they
suggest
that
the
federalist
papers
are
after
all
only
special
pleading.
well,
we
do
not
have
to
pause
long
with
that
contention.
this
court
has
characterized
the
federalist
papers
time
and
time
again
as
the
most
authoritative
evidence
of
the
intention
of
the
founders.
they
have
difficulty
with
the
constitutional
opinion
of
their
own
select
committee.
we
point
out
in
our
brief
that
there
own
select
committee
said,
the
house
had
no
constitutional
power
to
exclude
mr.
powell.
they
have
difficulty
with
the
opinion
of
the
most
dominant
constitutional
authority
in
the
house,
the
chairman
of
the
judiciary
committee.
they
have
difficulty
with
this
court's
decision
in
bond
against
floyd
which
proceeds
on
the
assumption
that
the
statements
of
madison
and
hamilton
meant
what
they
said.
so,
they
suggested
this
court
that
it's
a
position
and
thinking
in
bond
against
floyd
is
mere
dictum.
having
these
difficulties,
the
respondents
reached
back
into
history
for
precedent
to
explain
that
madison
and
hamilton
did
not
mean
what
they
said.
that
the
founders
in
fact
intended
to
allow
some
sort
of
inherent
power
in
the
legislature
to
exclude
otherwise
duly
qualified
representatives
of
the
people.
upon
the
legislatures
own
notion
of
unfixed
but
what
is
extraordinary
is
that
there
entire
constitutional
edifice
rests
upon
a
precedent
that
they
grasped
from
history,
what
is
the
precedent?
the
wilkes
case,
the
exclusion
of
john
wilkes
by
the
british
parliament
and
blackstone's
rationale
in
justification
for
the
parliament
reaction.
they
say
that
since
american
lawyers
were
schooled
in
blackstone
as
we
all
know.
the
founders
must
have
adopted
his
justification
for
the
action
of
the
british
parliament
in
excluding
wilkes.
but
i
suggest
to
the
court
this
is
fantastic
that
it
turns
history
upon
its
head
that
the
wilkes
case
was
the
very
lesson,
madison
said
in
philadelphia
was
what
we
must
prevent
in
the
new
republic
in
this
republic.
and
blackstone's
justification
for
the
action
of
the
british
parliament
upon
which
their
entire
constitutional
case
rests.
they
do
not
inform
the
court,
was
first
of
all
not
included
in
this
first
commentaries
he
was
very
embarrass
on
the
floor
of
parliament
when
he
appeared
as
a
special
plea
therefore
the
majesty's
government
to
justify
the
wilkes
exclusion
when
his
own
commentaries
were
read
against
him.
so,
he
revise
his
opinion
to
justify
the
wilkes
exclusion
and
he
was
then
attacked
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
by
the
leading
spokesman
for
the
colonial
courts
as
evidencing
the
precise
theory
of
legislative
tyranny
which
the
colonist
were
rising
against.
then,
we
have
set
forth
with
the
court's
convenience
in
our
reply
brief.
the
famous
“junius”
papers
which
repudiate
that
blackstone
position
but
most
important
of
all,
the
blackstone
position
was
repudiated
by
the
parliament
itself
when
it
expunge
the
wilkes
exclusion
resolution,
five
years
before
the
philadelphia
convention
when
it
expunge
it
as
what,
as
subversive
of
the
rights
of
the
electorate
of
the
british
isles.
and
finally,
the
blackstone
opinion
is
not
even
considered
english
law
today.
as
professor
holdsworth
in
his
most
dominant
history
of
the
british
english
law
sets
out.
so,
i
suggest
the
respondent's
entire
constitutional
argument
is
based
upon
theories
and
actions
of
the
british
parliament
of
george
iii
which
were
at
the
very
core
of
american
opposition,
the
british
league
--
legislative
tyranny
at
this
has
at
least
proven
to
me.
the
wisdom
of
mr.
justice
holmes
comments
that
at
page
of
history
worth
the
volume
of
logic.
but
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
this
understanding
that
the
founders
insisted
that
the
legislature
was
to
have
no
power
to
refuse
the
seat
and
otherwise
duly
qualified
representative
of
the
people
is
the
key
to
the
question
of
justiciability
and
is
the
key
to
the
question
of
the
role
of
this
court
in
this
case.
in
this
case
as
in
baker-carr,
non-justiciability
had
become
little
more
than
a
play
in
words.
for
baker-carr
teaches
that
the
test
of
non-justiciability
in
the
political
question
doctrine
is
deciding
whether
a
manner
has
been
in
anyway
committed
by
the
constitution
to
another
branch
of
government
or
whether
the
action
of
that
branch
succeeds,
whatever
authority
has
been
committed,
or
justice
harlan
pointed
out
his
opinion
in
baker-carr
that
it's
quite
necessary
to
cut
through
the
thick
of
discussion
about
justiciability
and
get
to
the
point
as
to
whether
complaint
discloses
the
violation
of
our
federal
constitutional
right.
this
inquiry
the
court
has
thought
us
all
in
baker-carr,
requires
a
delicate
exercise
in
constitutional
interpretation
and
it
is
the
responsibility
of
this
court
as
the
ultimate
interpreter
of
the
constitution
to
make
it.
this
is
the
key
to
this
case.
the
question
as
to
who
may
be
the
freely
chosen
representatives
of
the
people
has
not
been
confronted
by
the
constitution
to
the
exclusive
control
of
the
legislature
quite
to
the
contrary.
it
has
been
confided
by
the
constitution
to
the
ultimate
branch
of
government,
the
sovereign
people.
in
the
written
document
they
established
as
their
fundamental
law.
this
is
because
the
fundamental
process
itself
of
representative
government
requires
that
the
free
choice
of
the
people's
representatives
remain
with
the
people,
subject
only
to
the
qualifications
they
themselves
lay
down
in
their
constitution.
so,
under
the
teachings
of
the
court
in
baker-carr,
this
is
a
case
in
which
judicial
power
must
be
exercised
with
the
action
of
the
legislatures
exceeded
the
authority
committed
to
it.
it
is
suggested
that
relief
here
would
violate
separation
of
powers.
the
contrary
is
true.
relief
here
is
required
to
preserve
the
powers
reserved
to
the
sovereign
people
by
the
constitution.
this
is
the
most
historic
role
of
this
court
and
the
words
of
the
chief
justice
in
marbury
are
decisive
here.
and
his
question
is
the
question,
we
must
all
answer
to
what
purpose
or
powers
limited
and
to
what
purposes
is
that
limitation
committed
to
writing,
if
these
limits
may
at
any
time
be
passed
by
those
intended
to
be
restrained.
and
let
me
speak
frankly
at
this
point,
what
is
that
the
heart
of
the
reluctance
of
the
lower
courts
to
grant
relief
here?
it
is
the
fear
of
a
confrontation
with
the
house,
but
this
fear
in
itself
unreal
since
in
the
words
of
this
court,
it
is
an
inadmissible
suggestion
that
the
house
would
not
accept
this
court's
role
as
the
ultimate
interpreter
of
the
constitution.
this
fear
would
paralyze
the
court
in
its
most
important
function
to
preserve
a
rule
of
law,
the
foundation
stone
of
which
is
a
written
constitution.
a
fear
to
act
here
because
respondents
have
power
would
in
the
chief
justice's
words
in
marbury
subvert
the
very
foundations
of
all
written
constitutions.
at
another
priceless
point
in
the
history
of
this
court,
this
court
said
in
cooper
against
aaron
that
marbury
declared
the
basic
principle
that
the
federal
judiciary
is
supreme
in
the
exposition
of
the
law
of
the
constitution
and
that
this
principle
has
been
respected
by
this
court
and
by
the
country
as
a
permanent
and
indispensable
feature
of
our
constitutional
system.
the
reaffirmation
of
that
this
is
a
government
of
laws
and
not
men
that
represented
of
government
means
that
ultimate
power
remains
with
the
people
is
particularly
necessary
when
the
crisis
arises
in
a
context
in
which
black
citizens
are
denied
the
right
to
elect
their
own
black
representative
who
had
reason
to
great
heights
of
legislative
leadership.
it
is
difficult
indeed
to
demand
law
and
order
of
american
citizens
if
the
legislative
branch
itself
denies
the
first
assumptions
of
an
ordered
society.
the
right
of
people
to
govern
themselves,
thus,
to
grant
relief
here
would
not
only
be
to
reaffirm
the
fundamentals
of
a
representative
government
but
it
would
reaffirm
the
fact,
that
the
principles
of
populous
sovereignty
are
equally
applicable
to
citizen's
black
and
white.
such
a
decision
in
justice
clark's
words
concurring
in
baker-carr
would
be
in
the
greatest
tradition
of
this
court.
professor
reid
will
continue
the
argument.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
may
it
please
the
court.
there
have
been
some
rather
unusual
statements
made
in
court
this
morning
which
we
would
like
to
respond
to
very
briefly.
in
the
first
place,
in
response
to
the
chief
justice's
question
as
to
the
speaker's
ruling.
i
called
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
the
congressional
record
for
january
3rd
h14,
the
speaker's
ruling
is
set
forth
in
full
the
speaker
ruled
that
the
question
as
to
the
punishment
of
mr.
powell
for
act's
committed
in
the
88th
or
89th
congress
is
not
germane
to
the
proposition
that
he
now
be
sworn
in.
the
speaker
based
this
ruling,
mr.
justice
white
upon
the
precedents
of
the
house
and
contrary
to
what
judge
bromley
had
said,
the
precedents
of
the
house
are
full
and
clear
on
this
question
and
they
start
with
the
case
which
is
most
famous
in
american
history.
the
case
of
matthew
lyon
in
the
fifth
congress
which
congressman
lyon
was
convicted
under
the
alien
and
sedition
act
and
a
motion
was
made
to
expel
him
before
the
house.
the
house
then
composed
of
gentlemen
who
had
participated
in
the
framing
of
the
constitution.
for
we
debated
the
issue
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
house
had
no
constitutional
power
whatsoever
to
expel,
and
mind
you,
this
is
under
the
expulsion
clause
not
exclusion
clause
no
constitutional
power
to
expel
a
member
for
alleged
acts
occurring
prior
to
his
election
and
in
full
the
annals
of
congress
point
out
that
the
fundamental
reason
was
the
very
same
reason
which
madison
and
hamilton
advanced.
and
that
is
that
the
ultimate
tribunal
and
to
the
fitness
of
a
member
is
not
the
congress
of
the
united
states
but
the
tribunal
it's
fitness
of
a
member
is
his
constituency
is
the
people
of
the
united
states,
the
people
he
represents.
the
president
of
the
matthew
lyon
case
has
been
followed
fully
and
completely,
never
deviated
once
in
the
five
cases
on
expulsion
in
the
history
of
the
house
and
for
the
convenience
of
the
court,
we
have
set
them
out
info
in
our
reply
brief
pages
18
through
23.
and
just
as
so
that
there
would
be
no
question
about
that
whatsoever,
the
official
historian
of
the
house,
mr.
galloway
says
in
this
history
of
the
house
of
representative,
he
concluded
that
i
quote,
“in
general
the
house
has
been
dubious
of
its
power
to
punish
members
for
offenses
committed
before
their
election.”
now,
it
turn
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
the
order
of
the
speaker
chief
justice,
is
in
the
official
record
which
the
parties
have
stipulated,
copies
are
to
be
available
to
the
court.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that
ruling
is
referred
to
in
our
brief,
in
our
reply
brief.
it
is
not
set
forth
in
full.
it
is
in
the
official
document
set
forth
info.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
the
citation
is
january
3rd
congressional
record
1969,
h14.
now,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
the
next
question
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
1969.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
now
to
the
--
that
question
advance
that
this
court
has
no
power
under
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
now,
i
find
that
argument
rather
surprising
in
light
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
itself.
this
court
has
held
from
the
beginning
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
and
these
are
called
discussing
fully
with
the
court
in
the
eastland
case
last
term
has
held
that
the
clause
was
designed
to
protect
legislators
and
legitimate
legislative
business
from
criminal
or
civil
sanctions.
there
are
no
criminal
or
civil
sanctions
involved
in
this
case.
but
more
fundamentally,
in
kilbourn
against
thompson
which
is
the
founding
head
of
all
teaching
of
this
court
on
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes.
he
made
a
ruling
there
too
mr.
justice
white
and
i
make
that
very
clear.
the
ruling
in
march
of
1967
was
that
the
matter
before
the
house
was
an
exclusion
and
not
an
expulsion.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
except
two-thirds
vote.
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
that's
absolutely
correct.
now
in
kilbourn
itself,
the
court
held
that
the
resolution
of
the
house
of
representatives
then
before
the
court
was
unconstitutional
and
void,
and
held
it
directly
and
the
relief
that
flowed
from
that
was
the
relief
which
was
directed
toward
this
sergeant
at
arms
of
the
house.
so,
that
in
the
very
case
which
the
respondents
rely
on
which
supposedly
deprives
this
court
of
its
historic
power
of
judicial
review
over
actions
of
the
legislature
when
those
actions
transcend
constitutional
boundaries
in
that
very
case.
this
court
did
precisely
what
we
are
asking
the
court
to
do
here
and
that
is
declare
a
resolution
of
the
house
of
representatives
unconstitutional.
now,
this
was
no
minor
question.
this
reflected
the
understanding
of
the
court
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
does
not
repeal
marbury-madison.
the
speech
or
debate
clause
was
known
to
the
chief
justice
when
that
decision
was
handed
down.
the
speech
or
debate
clause
simply
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case
whatsoever,
nothing
whatsoever.
now
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
kilbourn
against
thompson
mr.
justice
black,
kilbourn
against
thompson
the
original
discussion
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause
in
this
court.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
right
your
honor.
that's
precisely
the
case
that
stated
that.
i
respectfully
would
bring
this
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
the
analysis
of
the
constitution
which
the
respondents
have
presented
here
today
is
--
has
one
fundamental
flaw
in
it.
the
fundamental
flaw
is
that
it
is
simply
not
the
analysis
of
hamilton
and
madison.
it
is
simply
not
the
analysis
of
the
founding
fathers
and
what
i
find
extraordinary
in
that
height
is
that
the
proposition
is
urged
before
this
court
that
the
legislative
power
which
the
british
parliament
asserted
in
the
wilkes
case.
one
of
the
most
central
and
decisive
causes
of
our
revolution
that
this
power
is
the
power
which
is
the
respondents
seek
to
sustain
their
action
upon.
i
never
would
have
expected
that
the
wilkes
case
would
once
again
be
argued
in
an
american
court.
now
i
have
to
say
one
thing,
i
think
it
is
outrageous
that
before
this
court
assertions
are
made
that
the
petitioner
was
guilty
of
certain
acts
that
the
petitioner
never
denied
his
guilt
of
certain
acts.
the
record
has
it
an
ounce
of
evidence
of
that
and
then,
i
want
to
make
is
very
clear.
we
did
not
boycott
those
hearings.
mr.
bromley
was
not
there.
we
were
there
and
the
petitioner
was
there,
and
we
asserted
our
constitutional
position
which
we
had
every
right
to
assert
before
that
house.
more
than
that,
i
think
it
is
not
proper
that
the
respondents
make
the
statements
they
do
about
petitioner
when
the
chairman
of
this
committee
itself,
mr.
hayes.
on
january
3rd
of
this
year
said,
that
the
findings
of
his
committee
were
not
judicially
ascertained
and
that
he
was
satisfied
that
no
inference
could
be
drawn
from
those
because
a
federal
grand
jury
had
not
seen
fit
to
indict
the
petitioner.
i
think
it's
improper
to
make
the
statements
about
petitioner
which
were
made.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes,
justice
black.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
we
said
before
the
committee
that
the
congress
had
the
power
on
the
question
of
seating
a
member
to
inquire
into
the
constitutional
qualifications
as
set
forth
in
the
constitution,
we
would
give
evidence
as
to
those
qualifications
we
did.
we
testified,
the
petitioner
testified
and
we
put
in
documentary
evidence
as
to
the
existence
of
the
three
constitutional
qualifications
for
membership.
we
said
that
house
had
no
power
under
the
constitution
to
go
beyond
that
question
and
that
was
the
position
we
took
before
the
select
committee.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
all
questions
on
the
constitutional
qualifications.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
justice
fortas,
subject
only
to
the
constitutional
mandate
that
they
could
not
punish
him
for
alleged
acts
occurring
prior
to
his
elect
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
otherwise
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
correct,
subject
to
an
adversary
proceeding
and
the
rights
of
the
adversary
proceeding,
and
subject
to
the
limitations
as
i
said
before
of
the
constitution.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
absolutely
right.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
well,
i
would
put
it
this
way
your
honor.
fundamentally,
the
constitutional
argument,
the
constitutional
position
is
the
same.
if
the
expulsion
power
were
used
in
affect
to
do
what
the
house
cannot
do
under
the
exclusion
power
that
is
to
add
a
qualification
to
membership
that
would
equally
fall
as
unconstitutional.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
no.
what
i'm
saying,
the
house
can
expel
under
the
punishment
clause
for
misbehavior
which
it's
found
within
that
session
of
the
congress
subject
of
course
to
other
limitations
in
the
constitution.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
well,
the
explanation
for
that
i
think
was
best
put
forward.
first
one,
it
was
never
discussed
in
the
house
in
the
matthew
lyons
case.
an
explanation
was
that
this
went
to
the
fundamental
principles
of
representative
government
because
the
founders
were
determined
that
under
no
guides
whatsoever.
the
house
was
the
half
power
of
overruling
the
choice
of
the
people
as
to
who
would
to
be
the
representative.
now
as
to
unfitness
or
prior
misbehavior,
the
house
specifically
discussed
this
in
the
lyons
case
and
said
--
because
there,
they
said
it
was
the
grossest
misbehavior.
he
was
charge
with
among
other
things
speeding
at
all
the
members
of
the
house
of
representatives,
matthew
lyons
was.
and
the
house
there
said
that
it
is
a
fundamental
principle
of
american
representative
government
that
the
court
of
resort
of
last
resort
as
to
the
fitness
of
a
member
is
his
constituency.
when
an
act
is
occurred
prior
to
the
election,
the
people
have
passed
on
it
by
electing
him
and
the
house
may
not
overrule.
to
allow
the
house
to
overrule
it
would
be
to
open
up
the
dangerous
road
which
madison
talked
of,
of
subverting
the
fundamental
principles
of
the
constitution.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
i
would
say
that.
yes,
your
honor
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
right.
i
think
the
constitutional
provisions
are
very
clear
and
the
precedents
of
the
house
are
very
clear
on
that.
finally,
i
would
like
to
just
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
essence,
the
respondents'
position
is
a
challenge
to
the
role
of
this
court
as
the
ultimate
interpreter
of
the
constitution,
that
the
short
answer
to
the
respondents'
entire
argument
can
be
put
no
better
than
chief
justice
marshall
put
it
in
marbury
against
madison.
that
it
is
for
the
judiciary
to
say
what
is
the
law
and
that
is
the
meaning
of
a
written
constitution.
and
to
argue
a
doctrine
which
says
that
the
legislature
can
transcend
the
boundaries
placed
in
the
constitution
is
to
subvert
the
very
meaning
of
a
written
constitution.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
were
wholly
unsupported
by
the
facts
themselves.
they’ve
talked
of
willful
contemptuous
a
conduct
in
the
part
of
the
petitioner
towards
the
courts
of
the
state
new
york,
and
on
april
11th
of
this
year,
the
appellate
division
of
this
court’s
to
state
of
new
york,
revoked,
resented,
and
vacated
the
judgment
of
criminal
contempt
against
the
petitioner.
they
talked
of
alleged
improper
use
of
committee
funds
and
yet,
mr.
hayes,
himself
the
chairman
of
the
committee
which
had
previously
investigate
said
on
the
floor
of
the
house,
in
supporting
the
admission
of
the
petitioner
without
any
qualifications
this
time,
he
pointed
out
that
when
these
supposed
facts
were
submitted
to
a
tribunal
which
has
the
power
to
investigate
a
grand
jury,
the
grand
jury
refused
to
return
any
bill
of
indictment
whatsoever.
this
illustrates
the
profundity
of
the
founder’s
insistence
that
this
rock
of
protection
be
written.
now,
the
respondents
have
a
great
difficulty
with
this
constitutional
of
analysis.
they
have
difficulty
with
the
writings
and
thinking
of
professor
warren,
who
after
lifetime
scholarly
expertise
came
to
the
conclusions
which
we
have
here
advanced.
did
they
suggest
that
professor
warren
through
his
lifetime
of
experience
did
not
have
the
same
time
to
examine
the
sources
of
history
which
turns
this
to
the
respondents
that
had.
we
don't
have
to
pause
long
on
this.
this
court
has
time
and
time
again
relied
only
in
bond
against
floyd
on
the
expertise
of
professor
warren.
think
of
difficulty
with
madison
and
hamilton
and
they
suggest
that
the
federalist
papers
are
after
all
only
special
pleading.
well,
we
do
not
have
to
pause
long
with
that
contention.
this
court
has
characterized
the
federalist
papers
time
and
time
again
as
the
most
authoritative
evidence
of
the
intention
of
the
founders.
they
have
difficulty
with
the
constitutional
opinion
of
their
own
select
committee.
we
point
out
in
our
brief
that
there
own
select
committee
said,
the
house
had
no
constitutional
power
to
exclude
mr.
powell.
they
have
difficulty
with
the
opinion
of
the
most
dominant
constitutional
authority
in
the
house,
the
chairman
of
the
judiciary
committee.
they
have
difficulty
with
this
court's
decision
in
bond
against
floyd
which
proceeds
on
the
assumption
that
the
statements
of
madison
and
hamilton
meant
what
they
said.
so,
they
suggested
this
court
that
it's
a
position
and
thinking
in
bond
against
floyd
is
mere
dictum.
having
these
difficulties,
the
respondents
reached
back
into
history
for
precedent
to
explain
that
madison
and
hamilton
did
not
mean
what
they
said.
that
the
founders
in
fact
intended
to
allow
some
sort
of
inherent
power
in
the
legislature
to
exclude
otherwise
duly
qualified
representatives
of
the
people.
upon
the
legislatures
own
notion
of
unfixed
but
what
is
extraordinary
is
that
there
entire
constitutional
edifice
rests
upon
a
precedent
that
they
grasped
from
history,
what
is
the
precedent?
the
wilkes
case,
the
exclusion
of
john
wilkes
by
the
british
parliament
and
blackstone's
rationale
in
justification
for
the
parliament
reaction.
they
say
that
since
american
lawyers
were
schooled
in
blackstone
as
we
all
know.
the
founders
must
have
adopted
his
justification
for
the
action
of
the
british
parliament
in
excluding
wilkes.
but
i
suggest
to
the
court
this
is
fantastic
that
it
turns
history
upon
its
head
that
the
wilkes
case
was
the
very
lesson,
madison
said
in
philadelphia
was
what
we
must
prevent
in
the
new
republic
in
this
republic.
and
blackstone's
justification
for
the
action
of
the
british
parliament
upon
which
their
entire
constitutional
case
rests.
they
do
not
inform
the
court,
was
first
of
all
not
included
in
this
first
commentaries
he
was
very
embarrass
on
the
floor
of
parliament
when
he
appeared
as
a
special
plea
therefore
the
majesty's
government
to
justify
the
wilkes
exclusion
when
his
own
commentaries
were
read
against
him.
so,
he
revise
his
opinion
to
justify
the
wilkes
exclusion
and
he
was
then
attacked
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
by
the
leading
spokesman
for
the
colonial
courts
as
evidencing
the
precise
theory
of
legislative
tyranny
which
the
colonist
were
rising
against.
then,
we
have
set
forth
with
the
court's
convenience
in
our
reply
brief.
the
famous
“junius”
papers
which
repudiate
that
blackstone
position
but
most
important
of
all,
the
blackstone
position
was
repudiated
by
the
parliament
itself
when
it
expunge
the
wilkes
exclusion
resolution,
five
years
before
the
philadelphia
convention
when
it
expunge
it
as
what,
as
subversive
of
the
rights
of
the
electorate
of
the
british
isles.
and
finally,
the
blackstone
opinion
is
not
even
considered
english
law
today.
as
professor
holdsworth
in
his
most
dominant
history
of
the
british
english
law
sets
out.
so,
i
suggest
the
respondent's
entire
constitutional
argument
is
based
upon
theories
and
actions
of
the
british
parliament
of
george
iii
which
were
at
the
very
core
of
american
opposition,
the
british
league
--
legislative
tyranny
at
this
has
at
least
proven
to
me.
the
wisdom
of
mr.
justice
holmes
comments
that
at
page
of
history
worth
the
volume
of
logic.
but
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
this
understanding
that
the
founders
insisted
that
the
legislature
was
to
have
no
power
to
refuse
the
seat
and
otherwise
duly
qualified
representative
of
the
people
is
the
key
to
the
question
of
justiciability
and
is
the
key
to
the
question
of
the
role
of
this
court
in
this
case.
in
this
case
as
in
baker-carr,
non-justiciability
had
become
little
more
than
a
play
in
words.
for
baker-carr
teaches
that
the
test
of
non-justiciability
in
the
political
question
doctrine
is
deciding
whether
a
manner
has
been
in
anyway
committed
by
the
constitution
to
another
branch
of
government
or
whether
the
action
of
that
branch
succeeds,
whatever
authority
has
been
committed,
or
justice
harlan
pointed
out
his
opinion
in
baker-carr
that
it's
quite
necessary
to
cut
through
the
thick
of
discussion
about
justiciability
and
get
to
the
point
as
to
whether
complaint
discloses
the
violation
of
our
federal
constitutional
right.
this
inquiry
the
court
has
thought
us
all
in
baker-carr,
requires
a
delicate
exercise
in
constitutional
interpretation
and
it
is
the
responsibility
of
this
court
as
the
ultimate
interpreter
of
the
constitution
to
make
it.
this
is
the
key
to
this
case.
the
question
as
to
who
may
be
the
freely
chosen
representatives
of
the
people
has
not
been
confronted
by
the
constitution
to
the
exclusive
control
of
the
legislature
quite
to
the
contrary.
it
has
been
confided
by
the
constitution
to
the
ultimate
branch
of
government,
the
sovereign
people.
in
the
written
document
they
established
as
their
fundamental
law.
this
is
because
the
fundamental
process
itself
of
representative
government
requires
that
the
free
choice
of
the
people's
representatives
remain
with
the
people,
subject
only
to
the
qualifications
they
themselves
lay
down
in
their
constitution.
so,
under
the
teachings
of
the
court
in
baker-carr,
this
is
a
case
in
which
judicial
power
must
be
exercised
with
the
action
of
the
legislatures
exceeded
the
authority
committed
to
it.
it
is
suggested
that
relief
here
would
violate
separation
of
powers.
the
contrary
is
true.
relief
here
is
required
to
preserve
the
powers
reserved
to
the
sovereign
people
by
the
constitution.
this
is
the
most
historic
role
of
this
court
and
the
words
of
the
chief
justice
in
marbury
are
decisive
here.
and
his
question
is
the
question,
we
must
all
answer
to
what
purpose
or
powers
limited
and
to
what
purposes
is
that
limitation
committed
to
writing,
if
these
limits
may
at
any
time
be
passed
by
those
intended
to
be
restrained.
and
let
me
speak
frankly
at
this
point,
what
is
that
the
heart
of
the
reluctance
of
the
lower
courts
to
grant
relief
here?
it
is
the
fear
of
a
confrontation
with
the
house,
but
this
fear
in
itself
unreal
since
in
the
words
of
this
court,
it
is
an
inadmissible
suggestion
that
the
house
would
not
accept
this
court's
role
as
the
ultimate
interpreter
of
the
constitution.
this
fear
would
paralyze
the
court
in
its
most
important
function
to
preserve
a
rule
of
law,
the
foundation
stone
of
which
is
a
written
constitution.
a
fear
to
act
here
because
respondents
have
power
would
in
the
chief
justice's
words
in
marbury
subvert
the
very
foundations
of
all
written
constitutions.
at
another
priceless
point
in
the
history
of
this
court,
this
court
said
in
cooper
against
aaron
that
marbury
declared
the
basic
principle
that
the
federal
judiciary
is
supreme
in
the
exposition
of
the
law
of
the
constitution
and
that
this
principle
has
been
respected
by
this
court
and
by
the
country
as
a
permanent
and
indispensable
feature
of
our
constitutional
system.
the
reaffirmation
of
that
this
is
a
government
of
laws
and
not
men
that
represented
of
government
means
that
ultimate
power
remains
with
the
people
is
particularly
necessary
when
the
crisis
arises
in
a
context
in
which
black
citizens
are
denied
the
right
to
elect
their
own
black
representative
who
had
reason
to
great
heights
of
legislative
leadership.
it
is
difficult
indeed
to
demand
law
and
order
of
american
citizens
if
the
legislative
branch
itself
denies
the
first
assumptions
of
an
ordered
society.
the
right
of
people
to
govern
themselves,
thus,
to
grant
relief
here
would
not
only
be
to
reaffirm
the
fundamentals
of
a
representative
government
but
it
would
reaffirm
the
fact,
that
the
principles
of
populous
sovereignty
are
equally
applicable
to
citizen's
black
and
white.
such
a
decision
in
justice
clark's
words
concurring
in
baker-carr
would
be
in
the
greatest
tradition
of
this
court.
professor
reid
will
continue
the
argument.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
may
it
please
the
court.
there
have
been
some
rather
unusual
statements
made
in
court
this
morning
which
we
would
like
to
respond
to
very
briefly.
in
the
first
place,
in
response
to
the
chief
justice's
question
as
to
the
speaker's
ruling.
i
called
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
the
congressional
record
for
january
3rd
h14,
the
speaker's
ruling
is
set
forth
in
full
the
speaker
ruled
that
the
question
as
to
the
punishment
of
mr.
powell
for
act's
committed
in
the
88th
or
89th
congress
is
not
germane
to
the
proposition
that
he
now
be
sworn
in.
the
speaker
based
this
ruling,
mr.
justice
white
upon
the
precedents
of
the
house
and
contrary
to
what
judge
bromley
had
said,
the
precedents
of
the
house
are
full
and
clear
on
this
question
and
they
start
with
the
case
which
is
most
famous
in
american
history.
the
case
of
matthew
lyon
in
the
fifth
congress
which
congressman
lyon
was
convicted
under
the
alien
and
sedition
act
and
a
motion
was
made
to
expel
him
before
the
house.
the
house
then
composed
of
gentlemen
who
had
participated
in
the
framing
of
the
constitution.
for
we
debated
the
issue
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
house
had
no
constitutional
power
whatsoever
to
expel,
and
mind
you,
this
is
under
the
expulsion
clause
not
exclusion
clause
no
constitutional
power
to
expel
a
member
for
alleged
acts
occurring
prior
to
his
election
and
in
full
the
annals
of
congress
point
out
that
the
fundamental
reason
was
the
very
same
reason
which
madison
and
hamilton
advanced.
and
that
is
that
the
ultimate
tribunal
and
to
the
fitness
of
a
member
is
not
the
congress
of
the
united
states
but
the
tribunal
it's
fitness
of
a
member
is
his
constituency
is
the
people
of
the
united
states,
the
people
he
represents.
the
president
of
the
matthew
lyon
case
has
been
followed
fully
and
completely,
never
deviated
once
in
the
five
cases
on
expulsion
in
the
history
of
the
house
and
for
the
convenience
of
the
court,
we
have
set
them
out
info
in
our
reply
brief
pages
18
through
23.
and
just
as
so
that
there
would
be
no
question
about
that
whatsoever,
the
official
historian
of
the
house,
mr.
galloway
says
in
this
history
of
the
house
of
representative,
he
concluded
that
i
quote,
“in
general
the
house
has
been
dubious
of
its
power
to
punish
members
for
offenses
committed
before
their
election.”
now,
it
turn
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
the
order
of
the
speaker
chief
justice,
is
in
the
official
record
which
the
parties
have
stipulated,
copies
are
to
be
available
to
the
court.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that
ruling
is
referred
to
in
our
brief,
in
our
reply
brief.
it
is
not
set
forth
in
full.
it
is
in
the
official
document
set
forth
info.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
the
citation
is
january
3rd
congressional
record
1969,
h14.
now,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
the
next
question
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
1969.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
now
to
the
--
that
question
advance
that
this
court
has
no
power
under
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
now,
i
find
that
argument
rather
surprising
in
light
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
itself.
this
court
has
held
from
the
beginning
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
and
these
are
called
discussing
fully
with
the
court
in
the
eastland
case
last
term
has
held
that
the
clause
was
designed
to
protect
legislators
and
legitimate
legislative
business
from
criminal
or
civil
sanctions.
there
are
no
criminal
or
civil
sanctions
involved
in
this
case.
but
more
fundamentally,
in
kilbourn
against
thompson
which
is
the
founding
head
of
all
teaching
of
this
court
on
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes.
he
made
a
ruling
there
too
mr.
justice
white
and
i
make
that
very
clear.
the
ruling
in
march
of
1967
was
that
the
matter
before
the
house
was
an
exclusion
and
not
an
expulsion.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
except
two-thirds
vote.
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
that's
absolutely
correct.
now
in
kilbourn
itself,
the
court
held
that
the
resolution
of
the
house
of
representatives
then
before
the
court
was
unconstitutional
and
void,
and
held
it
directly
and
the
relief
that
flowed
from
that
was
the
relief
which
was
directed
toward
this
sergeant
at
arms
of
the
house.
so,
that
in
the
very
case
which
the
respondents
rely
on
which
supposedly
deprives
this
court
of
its
historic
power
of
judicial
review
over
actions
of
the
legislature
when
those
actions
transcend
constitutional
boundaries
in
that
very
case.
this
court
did
precisely
what
we
are
asking
the
court
to
do
here
and
that
is
declare
a
resolution
of
the
house
of
representatives
unconstitutional.
now,
this
was
no
minor
question.
this
reflected
the
understanding
of
the
court
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
does
not
repeal
marbury-madison.
the
speech
or
debate
clause
was
known
to
the
chief
justice
when
that
decision
was
handed
down.
the
speech
or
debate
clause
simply
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case
whatsoever,
nothing
whatsoever.
now
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
kilbourn
against
thompson
mr.
justice
black,
kilbourn
against
thompson
the
original
discussion
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause
in
this
court.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
right
your
honor.
that's
precisely
the
case
that
stated
that.
i
respectfully
would
bring
this
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
the
analysis
of
the
constitution
which
the
respondents
have
presented
here
today
is
--
has
one
fundamental
flaw
in
it.
the
fundamental
flaw
is
that
it
is
simply
not
the
analysis
of
hamilton
and
madison.
it
is
simply
not
the
analysis
of
the
founding
fathers
and
what
i
find
extraordinary
in
that
height
is
that
the
proposition
is
urged
before
this
court
that
the
legislative
power
which
the
british
parliament
asserted
in
the
wilkes
case.
one
of
the
most
central
and
decisive
causes
of
our
revolution
that
this
power
is
the
power
which
is
the
respondents
seek
to
sustain
their
action
upon.
i
never
would
have
expected
that
the
wilkes
case
would
once
again
be
argued
in
an
american
court.
now
i
have
to
say
one
thing,
i
think
it
is
outrageous
that
before
this
court
assertions
are
made
that
the
petitioner
was
guilty
of
certain
acts
that
the
petitioner
never
denied
his
guilt
of
certain
acts.
the
record
has
it
an
ounce
of
evidence
of
that
and
then,
i
want
to
make
is
very
clear.
we
did
not
boycott
those
hearings.
mr.
bromley
was
not
there.
we
were
there
and
the
petitioner
was
there,
and
we
asserted
our
constitutional
position
which
we
had
every
right
to
assert
before
that
house.
more
than
that,
i
think
it
is
not
proper
that
the
respondents
make
the
statements
they
do
about
petitioner
when
the
chairman
of
this
committee
itself,
mr.
hayes.
on
january
3rd
of
this
year
said,
that
the
findings
of
his
committee
were
not
judicially
ascertained
and
that
he
was
satisfied
that
no
inference
could
be
drawn
from
those
because
a
federal
grand
jury
had
not
seen
fit
to
indict
the
petitioner.
i
think
it's
improper
to
make
the
statements
about
petitioner
which
were
made.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes,
justice
black.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
we
said
before
the
committee
that
the
congress
had
the
power
on
the
question
of
seating
a
member
to
inquire
into
the
constitutional
qualifications
as
set
forth
in
the
constitution,
we
would
give
evidence
as
to
those
qualifications
we
did.
we
testified,
the
petitioner
testified
and
we
put
in
documentary
evidence
as
to
the
existence
of
the
three
constitutional
qualifications
for
membership.
we
said
that
house
had
no
power
under
the
constitution
to
go
beyond
that
question
and
that
was
the
position
we
took
before
the
select
committee.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
all
questions
on
the
constitutional
qualifications.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
justice
fortas,
subject
only
to
the
constitutional
mandate
that
they
could
not
punish
him
for
alleged
acts
occurring
prior
to
his
elect
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
otherwise
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
correct,
subject
to
an
adversary
proceeding
and
the
rights
of
the
adversary
proceeding,
and
subject
to
the
limitations
as
i
said
before
of
the
constitution.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
absolutely
right.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
well,
i
would
put
it
this
way
your
honor.
fundamentally,
the
constitutional
argument,
the
constitutional
position
is
the
same.
if
the
expulsion
power
were
used
in
affect
to
do
what
the
house
cannot
do
under
the
exclusion
power
that
is
to
add
a
qualification
to
membership
that
would
equally
fall
as
unconstitutional.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
no.
what
i'm
saying,
the
house
can
expel
under
the
punishment
clause
for
misbehavior
which
it's
found
within
that
session
of
the
congress
subject
of
course
to
other
limitations
in
the
constitution.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
well,
the
explanation
for
that
i
think
was
best
put
forward.
first
one,
it
was
never
discussed
in
the
house
in
the
matthew
lyons
case.
an
explanation
was
that
this
went
to
the
fundamental
principles
of
representative
government
because
the
founders
were
determined
that
under
no
guides
whatsoever.
the
house
was
the
half
power
of
overruling
the
choice
of
the
people
as
to
who
would
to
be
the
representative.
now
as
to
unfitness
or
prior
misbehavior,
the
house
specifically
discussed
this
in
the
lyons
case
and
said
--
because
there,
they
said
it
was
the
grossest
misbehavior.
he
was
charge
with
among
other
things
speeding
at
all
the
members
of
the
house
of
representatives,
matthew
lyons
was.
and
the
house
there
said
that
it
is
a
fundamental
principle
of
american
representative
government
that
the
court
of
resort
of
last
resort
as
to
the
fitness
of
a
member
is
his
constituency.
when
an
act
is
occurred
prior
to
the
election,
the
people
have
passed
on
it
by
electing
him
and
the
house
may
not
overrule.
to
allow
the
house
to
overrule
it
would
be
to
open
up
the
dangerous
road
which
madison
talked
of,
of
subverting
the
fundamental
principles
of
the
constitution.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
i
would
say
that.
yes,
your
honor
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
right.
i
think
the
constitutional
provisions
are
very
clear
and
the
precedents
of
the
house
are
very
clear
on
that.
finally,
i
would
like
to
just
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
essence,
the
respondents'
position
is
a
challenge
to
the
role
of
this
court
as
the
ultimate
interpreter
of
the
constitution,
that
the
short
answer
to
the
respondents'
entire
argument
can
be
put
no
better
than
chief
justice
marshall
put
it
in
marbury
against
madison.
that
it
is
for
the
judiciary
to
say
what
is
the
law
and
that
is
the
meaning
of
a
written
constitution.
and
to
argue
a
doctrine
which
says
that
the
legislature
can
transcend
the
boundaries
placed
in
the
constitution
is
to
subvert
the
very
meaning
of
a
written
constitution.
thank
you,
your
honor.
