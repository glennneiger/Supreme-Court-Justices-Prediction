mr.
herbert
o.
reid
may
it
please
the
court.
we've
attempted
to
argue
in
our
brief
in
orally.
first
the
congress
did
not
have
the
power
to
exclude
congressman
adam
c.
powell
and
what
it
did
and
how
he
did
it
raise
further
constitutional
objections.
in
the
outset,
the
two
judges
in
the
court
of
appeals
tried
to
treat
this
matter
of
expulsion
--
treat
this
matter
of
exclusion
as
a
matter
of
expulsion.
and
have
it
clearly
that
should
be
laid
to
rest
in
the
beginning.
when
congress
was
organized
--
when
the
house
organized
on
january
3,
1969,
the
very
same
resolution
which
had
been
proposed
in
march
1,
1967,
the
subject
matter
of
our
discussion
here,
the
same
resolution
was
proposed.
the
speaker
was
called
upon
to
read
to
rule
on
whether
or
not
a
motion
to
exclude
with
germane
to
expel,
with
germane
to
his
seating
our
motion
to
exclude
in
which
the
speaker
wrote
with
january
3rd
that
such
a
motion
was
not
germane
that
on
the
seating
of
the
congressman.
the
only
question
opens
to
the
house
with
the
three
qualifications.
also,
the
speaker
wrote
on
march
the
1st
that
since
this
was
a
question
of
seating
that
the
necessary
vote
was
a
majority
vote
and
not
the
two-thirds
which
would
have
been
required
if
it
had
been
a
matter
of
expulsion.
the
justice's
below
suggests
that
this
is
an
immaterial
distinction
since
the
vote
was
large
enough
to
satisfy
the
two-thirds
requirement.
what
we
argue
here
is
that
of
course,
the
motives
of
the
members
of
the
house
in
voting
cannot
be
inquired
into
determine
how
they
would
have
voted
where
the
issue
expulsion.
but
more
fundamentally,
this
was
at
the
bottom
and
grounded
on
the
precedents
of
the
house
as
demonstrated
in
the
speaker
under
the
later
wrote
in
this
january
3,
1969.
these
precedents
dictated
that
the
speakers
earlier
ruling
that
the
vote
was
on
exclusion
because
the
house
could
not
expel
for
conduct
in
a
previous
session
and
it
was
no
question
as
the
conduct
alleged
here
in
had
taken
place
in
congres's
previous
to
90th
of
congress.
the
--
mr.
herbert
o.
reid
the
precedents
of
the
house
sir,
the
speaker
outlined
the
precedents
of
the
house
when
he
wrote
on
march
--
on
january
3,
1969
in
which
we've
included
the
copy
of
the
record
of
january
3rd.
in
which
he
gives
--
he
said
that
he
anticipated.
pardon
me.
that
he
had
anticipated
that
this
question
would
be
raised
and
therefore
he
had
had
his
brief
and
it
is
very
long
in
detailed
ruling
by
the
speaker
that
particular
time
citing
the
house
precedents.
mr.
herbert
o.
reid
sir?
mr.
herbert
o.
reid
well,
no
because
i
don't
know
of
any
matter
that
is
a
reason
that
would
have
given
the
court
the
opportunity,
sir,
to
have
decide
at
this.
there
is
however,
a
great
distinction
involved
in
judicial
standard
sir.
if
the
--
on
the
question
of
judging
an
election
and
seating.
of
course,
the
house
exercises
judicial
power
there
but
this
court
has
been
very
clear
in
a
number
of
cases
and
saying
that,
when
the
house
is
exercise
--
the
house
are
in,
they're
exercising
their
powers
or
in
expulsion.
that
this
is
a
judicial
power
of
the
highest
order
requiring
the
greatest
amount
of
due
process
protections
in
the
adversary
sense.
so,
for
an
additional
judicial
reason,
sir,
we
believe
that
this
role
that
this
exclusion
--
the
expulsion
could
not
be
--
the
exclusion
could
not
be
treated
as
expulsion.
mr.
herbert
o.
reid
yes,
of
course
as
i
said
the
--
in
terms
of
a
--
which
incidentally
we
contend
here
that
does
power
--
the
congress
did
not
--
the
house
did
not
have
the
power
and
beyond
that
the
money
in
which
out
of
the
congress
in
power
was
excluded
violates
other
provisions
of
the
constitution
to
wit
the
fifth
amendment
due
process
and
the
prohibition
against
bill
of
attainment.
certainly,
the
house
has
power
to
deal
with
a
member
and
the
member
elect
and
the
way
in
which
it
may
not
deal
with
a
general
member
of
the
societies
so
far
as
the
bill
of
attainder
is
concerned.
its
judicial
power
there
to
seat
and
to
remove
one
who
has
been
seated,
however,
where
one
was
never
seated
and
punishment
was
legislative
as
it
was
here
after
a
legislative
finding
and
at
no
time
with
any
resemblance
of
due
process
hearing
held.
we
contend
then
that
such
the
manner
in
which
this
was
accomplished
in
the
house
violates
first
the
due
process
while
this
substantively
and
procedural
requirements
and
in
addition
that
it
amounts
to
a
bill
of
attainment.
at
the
beginning
of
this
matter
in
the
90th
of
congress,
when
congressman
powell
was
asked
to
step
aside,
the
hayes
committee
had
concluded
its
report.
the
hayes
committee,
committee
on
administration
had
been
directed
by
a
resolution
which
is
in
the
hayes
report
at
pages
--
at
page
4
had
been
directed
by
the
resolution
to
investigate
the
various
committees
of
the
house
and
the
various
numbers
of
a
house
into
regard.
there
was
nothing
in
this
resolution
was
specify,
any
particular
committee,
any
particular
committee
chairman
or
any
particular
member
of
the
house.
nevertheless,
the
committee
proceeded
to
investigate
only
one.
congressman
powell
was
invited
to
attend
the
hayes
committee,
in
which
he
declined
at
page
84
that
levy
in
the
same
report
as
included
at
which
he
was
not
an
unconditional
declination
by
in
which
he
suggest
that
the
committee
that
a
charge
to
investigate
other
committees
and
other
people
in
congress.
and
as
soon
as
the
committee
had
done
this,
he
would
be
glad
to
appear
now,
this
position
who
has
asserted
by
the
very
reason
that
he
was
entitled
to
know
whether
or
not
this
was
preferential
treatment
as
to
him,
in
order
to
lay
an
equal
predicate
if
necessary
in
the
house
or
in
the
courts
if
the
matter
had
been
raised.
now,
he
was
denied
this
opportunity
and
then
when
the
select
committee
was
formed
and
directed
to
investigate
and
to
report
back
on
the
seating
of
the
congressman,
the
select
committee
declined
to
have
an
adversary
hearing
and
that
one
thing
that's
clear
in
this
record.
it
is
the
chairman
celler's
position
and
the
position
of
the
committee
that
this
was
not
an
adversary
hearing.
as
a
result,
he
was
not
afforded
the
rights
of
an
adversary
hearing
and
therefore,
the
findings
are
mere
legislative
findings.
and
i
think
the
affect
of
such
findings
are
clearly
illustrated
by
the
january
3rd
proceeding
in
the
house
in
1969.
where
even
though
these
facts
are
not
refuted
anywhere
because
we
didn't
have
adversary
hearing.
they
have
been
completely
repudiated.
mr.
hayes
who
was
chairman
of
the
subcommittee
on
administration,
pointed
not
only
that
they
had
--
they
didn't
found
insufficient
by
grand
jury
but
he
said,
“they
are
insufficient
for
us
to
act
on,
the
way
we
find
facts
in
the
house,”
he
said,
“in
no
basis
upon
which
to
predicate
this
kind
of
action.”
gentleman,
mr.
hayes
made
that
statement
himself
in
the
record
on
january
3rd.
so,
the
first
predicate
of
the
house's
action,
the
hayes
report.
the
second
predicate,
the
proceedings
in
the
new
york
court
have
both
been
the
support
of
these
have
been
withdrawn
from
the
house's
position.
in
addition,
the
house
reported
to
furnish
congressman
powell
for
his
contumacious
conduct
toward
the
select
committee
and
that
contumacious
conduct
where
they
refuse
over
to
participate
in
a
legislative
hearing
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
should
be
seated.
for
--
so,
for
exercising
his
constitutional
right
as
the
court
pointed
out
this
morning
in
the
decision
in
the
resident
requirement
cases,
he
was
being
punished
then
for
asserting
a
constitutional
right
and
that's
impermissible
whether
the
assertion
is
good
or
bad.
beyond
this
he
was
denied
all
of
the
procedure
work
guaranties
and
for
a
very
good
reason,
i
think.
for
the
very
inception
of
this
matter,
mr.
powell
would
notify
that
the
select
committee
would
investigate,
“into
his
official
misconduct
since
1961.”
of
course,
that's
a
frightening
suggestion
to
most
people
but
this
--
it
was
open
ended
and
to
the
day
in
which
he
had
assumed
the
chairmanship
of
this
committee.
at
the
time
he
assumed
this
chairmanship
of
this
committee,
there
was
great
question
raised
in
the
house
and
addressed
to
the
speaker
as
to
whether
or
not
mr.
powell
would
be
elected
by
the
house
as
chairman
of
this
committee,
since
he
was
then
the
senior
person
or
would
he
be
avoided
because
of
his
race
and
of
course,
he
was
re-elected.
and
what
relevance
other
than
this
that
the
notice
of
his
official
misconduct
to
date
of
his
taken
on
the
chairmanship
has
--
i
do
not
know.
mr.
herbert
o.
reid
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
o.
reid
there
are
two
problems,
mr.
justice
fortas.
first,
procedural
due
process,
i
have
no
and
i
have
no
problem
that
the
house
would
have
to
afford
here
an
adversary
hearing,
affording
all
the
requisites
of
due
process.
procedural
due
process,
as
to
the
matter
of
the
substantive
due
process
implicit
in
your
question,
i
have
some
difficulty
as
members
of
the
house
have
and
the
members
of
the
senate
from
time
to
time
across
on
in
each
one
that
they
should
write
some
rules
and
regulations
before
the
fact
so
as
to
avoid
the
same
kind
of
situation.
congressman
fusco
introduced
the
resolution
in
the
house
several
days
after
this
occurred,
to
call
him
for
a
select
committee
to
set
up
standards.
i
would
not
go
so
far
to
say
sir
that
before
these
standards
arouse
were
set
up
that
the
house
would
be
important
to
act.
i
think
the
house
might
be
able
to
proceed
on
account
of
a
common
law
reference
--
mr.
herbert
o.
reid
which
have
been
suggested
by
some
of
the
rights,
sir.
mr.
herbert
o.
reid
well,
misappropriation
of
funds,
yes
sir.
however,
in
terms
of
such
a
proceeding,
and
to
defense
to
that
the
conduct
other
members
of
the
house
would
be
highly
relevant.
and
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
i'm
sure
that
the
house
did
not
want
to
afford
him
a
due
process
hearing.
because
they
didn't
want
any
comparative
study
made
and
this
is
indicated
also
about
--
january
3rd
record
of
1969
when
chairman
celler
said
as
to
nepotism,
judge
not
lest,
you
be
judged.
mr.
herbert
o.
reid
no,
sir.
i'm
not
saying
that
mr.
justice
fortas.
what
i
am
saying
that
the
relevant
to
the
expulsion
of
the
one
is
the
conduct
of
others
and
whether
or
not
under
the
equal
cases.
whether
or
not
he
then
has
an
equal
protection
argument
because
of
being
singled
out
and
this
was
highly
relevant
in
the
particular
case
as
well
as
the
conduct
of
other
members.
and
i
think
that
there
is
no
other
justification
for
the
house's
failure
to
accord
him
a
due
process
hearing.
they're
requiring
the
attendance
of
witnesses
and
the
like
other
than
they
wanted
to
avoid
this
comparative
study,
to
which
i
think
he
was
entitled
to.
beyond
the
constitutional
infirmities
of
due
process
and
(inaudible)
which
clearly
are
going
back
to
the
main
part
of
our
argument
would
indicate
that
this
court
had
jurisdiction
and
that
the
issues
were
just
justiciable.
i
want
to
say
a
word
about
mootness
and
remedy.
the
house
has
suggested
that
the
seating
of
congressman
powell
on
january
3,
1969
had
mooted
this
controversy
to
which
we
take
issue
in
our
memorandum
in
our
position
in
which
we
contained
narrow
to
argue
that
the
manner
had
not
been
come
moot.
one,
because
this
is
continuous
conduct,
the
kind
of
continuous
conduct
that
we
had
complained
about
in
the
original
suit.
and
on
january
the
3rd
1969
when
the
motion
which
finally
passed
--
the
motion
which
finally
passed
seating
him
carried
the
findings
from
the
90th
congress
with
no
question
whether
the
same
punishment,
the
same
conduct,
the
same
activity
was
the
basis
of
the
discriminatory
action
which
took
place
on
january
3,
1969.
in
addition,
we
take
the
further
position
that
the
house
could
not
moot
this
case
by
further
unconstitutional
conduct.
therefore,
in
order
for
this
court
to
determine
that
this
case
had
been
mooted
by
the
january
3rd
action
of
the
house.
this
court
would
have
to
find
that
the
january
3rd
resolution
which
seated
him
on
condition
of
paying
of
fine
and
other
limitations
whether
that
action
of
the
house
was
correct.
in
addition
to
the
continuing
conduct,
obviously
as
the
court
suggested
in
bond
case.
we
have
a
question
of
the
backpay
from
the
two
years
in
which
he
was
not
allowed
to
seat.
an
amount
i
think
estimated
by
the
chairman
of
--
mr.
chairman
celler,
as
$55,000.00
but
in
addition,
this
resolution
which
a
levy
to
fine
upon
him.
thereby
adding
the
resolution
of
january
3rd
seated
him
were
clearly
and
then
the
--
against
the
pleadings
of
the
leadership
of
the
house,
mr.
albert,
mr.
celler,
mention
just
a
few
your
honor,
all
suggested
that
the
house
would
not
punish
him
prior
to
seating
him
because
to
do
so
was
to
add
to
the
qualifications.
mr.
kinoy
has
pointed
out.
and
now
the
house
is
now
in
position
of
the
respondent
is
that
this
further
illegal
conduct
moots
this
controversy
to
which
we
take
exception
and
press
before
you
that
this
matter
is
not
moot,
ready
for
the
decision
and
should
be
decided
in
order
to
cover
to
the
matter
of
backpay
as
well
as
the
other
punishment
position
provisions
of
the
resolution.
now,
as
to
remedy
because
the
big
stone
in
bond
in
this
case
all
along
has
been
the
remedy
aspect,
and
whether
the
court
could
enforce
its
mandate.
i
think
the
difficult
in
our
position
since
you
agree
to
took
the
outset,
a
mandamus
was
proper
and
that
we
were
entitled
to
mandamus
from
marbury,
to
the
case
of
marbury
down.
i
think
the
fact
that
the
congressman
had
been
seated
however,
removes
his
difficulty
considerably.
the
--
therefore,
i
think
the
remedy
problem
becomes
much,
much
easier
to
handle
and
to
direct
here
in
terms
of
declaring
the
resolution
278
and
of
march
1,
1967,
and
the
resolution
of
january
3,
1969
unconstitutional.
i
think
that
in
the
light
of
the
--
mr.
herbert
o.
reid
sir
--
mr.
herbert
o.
reid
well,
we
feel
that
it
is
in
number
one,
we
feel
that
this
is
in
part
of
the
illegal
unconstitutional
conduct
for
which
we
had
complained
about
in
the
original
suit.
that
is
the
predicate
sir,
before
the
passage
of
the
resolution
on
january
3rd
was
the
same
conduct.
mr.
herbert
o.
reid
in
fact
of
the
matter,
he
took
the
same
language.
mr.
herbert
o.
reid
no,
it
has
not
sir.
because
this
action
took
place
on
the
matter
it
was
appending
here.
of
course
also,
implicit
in
any
notion
of
mootness
is
the
validity
of
this
action.
in
terms
and
of
the
remedy,
we
feel
that
the
house
cannot
be
anticipated.
the
house
would
not
obey
the
declaration
of
law
by
this
court
as
it
has
from
marbury
through
cooper
and
(inaudible)
and
that
there
is
no
inhibition
to
the
kind
of
remedy
we
seek
here
coming
out
of
the
constitution
itself
with
no
basis
for
believing
that
the
historical
role
of
this
court
in
the
area
of
judicial
review
has
been
that
it
had
judgment
that
it
--
that
in
separation
of
powers
what
had
been
separated
and
given
to
the
judiciary
was
the
matter
of
deciding
cases.
mr.
herbert
o.
reid
sir?
no,
sir.
we
argue
that
we
entitle
to
character
judgment
injunctive
relief
and
we
press
for
mandamus
--
mr.
herbert
o.
reid
well,
mandatory
relief
sir.
in
the
sense
of
the
only
inability
to
the
paying
of
disability
remedy,
to
the
paying
of
this
fine
--
of
paying
of
a
backpay
of
$55,000.00
is
of
course
a
resolution
of
the
house
which
has
directed
the
--
in
effect
that
he
had
not
be
pay
because
he
was
not
seated.
and
as
in
the
mangual
case
--
mr.
herbert
o.
reid
no,
sir.
because
he
was
not
--
mr.
herbert
o.
reid
yes,
sir.
of
the
resolution
278
and
we
are
saying
the
declaration
of
unconstitutionality
as
the
court
did
in
the
mangual
which
we
cite
in
our
reply
brief.
it
--
incidentally,
it
did
not
issue
mandamus
against
the
comptroller
even
if
it
did
--
even
though
it
did
against
another
government
official,
under
the
theory
that
as
soon
as
control
are
read
and
its
opinion,
the
court
itself.
the
mandatory
relief
was
not
necessary
that
he
would
act
accordingly
and
we
amend
as
suggesting
here
that
everything
indicates
to
us
that
in
this
court
exercise
this
historical
judicial
function
and
declares
this
resolution
unconstitutional
that
the
house
would
abide
by
that.
mr.
herbert
o.
reid
yes.
i
think
that
effective
relief
here
at
the
--
by
declaration
of
unconstitutionality
to
said
date.
mr.
herbert
o.
reid
may
it
please
the
court.
we've
attempted
to
argue
in
our
brief
in
orally.
first
the
congress
did
not
have
the
power
to
exclude
congressman
adam
c.
powell
and
what
it
did
and
how
he
did
it
raise
further
constitutional
objections.
in
the
outset,
the
two
judges
in
the
court
of
appeals
tried
to
treat
this
matter
of
expulsion
--
treat
this
matter
of
exclusion
as
a
matter
of
expulsion.
and
have
it
clearly
that
should
be
laid
to
rest
in
the
beginning.
when
congress
was
organized
--
when
the
house
organized
on
january
3,
1969,
the
very
same
resolution
which
had
been
proposed
in
march
1,
1967,
the
subject
matter
of
our
discussion
here,
the
same
resolution
was
proposed.
the
speaker
was
called
upon
to
read
to
rule
on
whether
or
not
a
motion
to
exclude
with
germane
to
expel,
with
germane
to
his
seating
our
motion
to
exclude
in
which
the
speaker
wrote
with
january
3rd
that
such
a
motion
was
not
germane
that
on
the
seating
of
the
congressman.
the
only
question
opens
to
the
house
with
the
three
qualifications.
also,
the
speaker
wrote
on
march
the
1st
that
since
this
was
a
question
of
seating
that
the
necessary
vote
was
a
majority
vote
and
not
the
two-thirds
which
would
have
been
required
if
it
had
been
a
matter
of
expulsion.
the
justice's
below
suggests
that
this
is
an
immaterial
distinction
since
the
vote
was
large
enough
to
satisfy
the
two-thirds
requirement.
what
we
argue
here
is
that
of
course,
the
motives
of
the
members
of
the
house
in
voting
cannot
be
inquired
into
determine
how
they
would
have
voted
where
the
issue
expulsion.
but
more
fundamentally,
this
was
at
the
bottom
and
grounded
on
the
precedents
of
the
house
as
demonstrated
in
the
speaker
under
the
later
wrote
in
this
january
3,
1969.
these
precedents
dictated
that
the
speakers
earlier
ruling
that
the
vote
was
on
exclusion
because
the
house
could
not
expel
for
conduct
in
a
previous
session
and
it
was
no
question
as
the
conduct
alleged
here
in
had
taken
place
in
congres's
previous
to
90th
of
congress.
the
--
mr.
herbert
o.
reid
the
precedents
of
the
house
sir,
the
speaker
outlined
the
precedents
of
the
house
when
he
wrote
on
march
--
on
january
3,
1969
in
which
we've
included
the
copy
of
the
record
of
january
3rd.
in
which
he
gives
--
he
said
that
he
anticipated.
pardon
me.
that
he
had
anticipated
that
this
question
would
be
raised
and
therefore
he
had
had
his
brief
and
it
is
very
long
in
detailed
ruling
by
the
speaker
that
particular
time
citing
the
house
precedents.
mr.
herbert
o.
reid
sir?
mr.
herbert
o.
reid
well,
no
because
i
don't
know
of
any
matter
that
is
a
reason
that
would
have
given
the
court
the
opportunity,
sir,
to
have
decide
at
this.
there
is
however,
a
great
distinction
involved
in
judicial
standard
sir.
if
the
--
on
the
question
of
judging
an
election
and
seating.
of
course,
the
house
exercises
judicial
power
there
but
this
court
has
been
very
clear
in
a
number
of
cases
and
saying
that,
when
the
house
is
exercise
--
the
house
are
in,
they're
exercising
their
powers
or
in
expulsion.
that
this
is
a
judicial
power
of
the
highest
order
requiring
the
greatest
amount
of
due
process
protections
in
the
adversary
sense.
so,
for
an
additional
judicial
reason,
sir,
we
believe
that
this
role
that
this
exclusion
--
the
expulsion
could
not
be
--
the
exclusion
could
not
be
treated
as
expulsion.
mr.
herbert
o.
reid
yes,
of
course
as
i
said
the
--
in
terms
of
a
--
which
incidentally
we
contend
here
that
does
power
--
the
congress
did
not
--
the
house
did
not
have
the
power
and
beyond
that
the
money
in
which
out
of
the
congress
in
power
was
excluded
violates
other
provisions
of
the
constitution
to
wit
the
fifth
amendment
due
process
and
the
prohibition
against
bill
of
attainment.
certainly,
the
house
has
power
to
deal
with
a
member
and
the
member
elect
and
the
way
in
which
it
may
not
deal
with
a
general
member
of
the
societies
so
far
as
the
bill
of
attainder
is
concerned.
its
judicial
power
there
to
seat
and
to
remove
one
who
has
been
seated,
however,
where
one
was
never
seated
and
punishment
was
legislative
as
it
was
here
after
a
legislative
finding
and
at
no
time
with
any
resemblance
of
due
process
hearing
held.
we
contend
then
that
such
the
manner
in
which
this
was
accomplished
in
the
house
violates
first
the
due
process
while
this
substantively
and
procedural
requirements
and
in
addition
that
it
amounts
to
a
bill
of
attainment.
at
the
beginning
of
this
matter
in
the
90th
of
congress,
when
congressman
powell
was
asked
to
step
aside,
the
hayes
committee
had
concluded
its
report.
the
hayes
committee,
committee
on
administration
had
been
directed
by
a
resolution
which
is
in
the
hayes
report
at
pages
--
at
page
4
had
been
directed
by
the
resolution
to
investigate
the
various
committees
of
the
house
and
the
various
numbers
of
a
house
into
regard.
there
was
nothing
in
this
resolution
was
specify,
any
particular
committee,
any
particular
committee
chairman
or
any
particular
member
of
the
house.
nevertheless,
the
committee
proceeded
to
investigate
only
one.
congressman
powell
was
invited
to
attend
the
hayes
committee,
in
which
he
declined
at
page
84
that
levy
in
the
same
report
as
included
at
which
he
was
not
an
unconditional
declination
by
in
which
he
suggest
that
the
committee
that
a
charge
to
investigate
other
committees
and
other
people
in
congress.
and
as
soon
as
the
committee
had
done
this,
he
would
be
glad
to
appear
now,
this
position
who
has
asserted
by
the
very
reason
that
he
was
entitled
to
know
whether
or
not
this
was
preferential
treatment
as
to
him,
in
order
to
lay
an
equal
predicate
if
necessary
in
the
house
or
in
the
courts
if
the
matter
had
been
raised.
now,
he
was
denied
this
opportunity
and
then
when
the
select
committee
was
formed
and
directed
to
investigate
and
to
report
back
on
the
seating
of
the
congressman,
the
select
committee
declined
to
have
an
adversary
hearing
and
that
one
thing
that's
clear
in
this
record.
it
is
the
chairman
celler's
position
and
the
position
of
the
committee
that
this
was
not
an
adversary
hearing.
as
a
result,
he
was
not
afforded
the
rights
of
an
adversary
hearing
and
therefore,
the
findings
are
mere
legislative
findings.
and
i
think
the
affect
of
such
findings
are
clearly
illustrated
by
the
january
3rd
proceeding
in
the
house
in
1969.
where
even
though
these
facts
are
not
refuted
anywhere
because
we
didn't
have
adversary
hearing.
they
have
been
completely
repudiated.
mr.
hayes
who
was
chairman
of
the
subcommittee
on
administration,
pointed
not
only
that
they
had
--
they
didn't
found
insufficient
by
grand
jury
but
he
said,
“they
are
insufficient
for
us
to
act
on,
the
way
we
find
facts
in
the
house,”
he
said,
“in
no
basis
upon
which
to
predicate
this
kind
of
action.”
gentleman,
mr.
hayes
made
that
statement
himself
in
the
record
on
january
3rd.
so,
the
first
predicate
of
the
house's
action,
the
hayes
report.
the
second
predicate,
the
proceedings
in
the
new
york
court
have
both
been
the
support
of
these
have
been
withdrawn
from
the
house's
position.
in
addition,
the
house
reported
to
furnish
congressman
powell
for
his
contumacious
conduct
toward
the
select
committee
and
that
contumacious
conduct
where
they
refuse
over
to
participate
in
a
legislative
hearing
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
should
be
seated.
for
--
so,
for
exercising
his
constitutional
right
as
the
court
pointed
out
this
morning
in
the
decision
in
the
resident
requirement
cases,
he
was
being
punished
then
for
asserting
a
constitutional
right
and
that's
impermissible
whether
the
assertion
is
good
or
bad.
beyond
this
he
was
denied
all
of
the
procedure
work
guaranties
and
for
a
very
good
reason,
i
think.
for
the
very
inception
of
this
matter,
mr.
powell
would
notify
that
the
select
committee
would
investigate,
“into
his
official
misconduct
since
1961.”
of
course,
that's
a
frightening
suggestion
to
most
people
but
this
--
it
was
open
ended
and
to
the
day
in
which
he
had
assumed
the
chairmanship
of
this
committee.
at
the
time
he
assumed
this
chairmanship
of
this
committee,
there
was
great
question
raised
in
the
house
and
addressed
to
the
speaker
as
to
whether
or
not
mr.
powell
would
be
elected
by
the
house
as
chairman
of
this
committee,
since
he
was
then
the
senior
person
or
would
he
be
avoided
because
of
his
race
and
of
course,
he
was
re-elected.
and
what
relevance
other
than
this
that
the
notice
of
his
official
misconduct
to
date
of
his
taken
on
the
chairmanship
has
--
i
do
not
know.
mr.
herbert
o.
reid
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
o.
reid
there
are
two
problems,
mr.
justice
fortas.
first,
procedural
due
process,
i
have
no
and
i
have
no
problem
that
the
house
would
have
to
afford
here
an
adversary
hearing,
affording
all
the
requisites
of
due
process.
procedural
due
process,
as
to
the
matter
of
the
substantive
due
process
implicit
in
your
question,
i
have
some
difficulty
as
members
of
the
house
have
and
the
members
of
the
senate
from
time
to
time
across
on
in
each
one
that
they
should
write
some
rules
and
regulations
before
the
fact
so
as
to
avoid
the
same
kind
of
situation.
congressman
fusco
introduced
the
resolution
in
the
house
several
days
after
this
occurred,
to
call
him
for
a
select
committee
to
set
up
standards.
i
would
not
go
so
far
to
say
sir
that
before
these
standards
arouse
were
set
up
that
the
house
would
be
important
to
act.
i
think
the
house
might
be
able
to
proceed
on
account
of
a
common
law
reference
--
mr.
herbert
o.
reid
which
have
been
suggested
by
some
of
the
rights,
sir.
mr.
herbert
o.
reid
well,
misappropriation
of
funds,
yes
sir.
however,
in
terms
of
such
a
proceeding,
and
to
defense
to
that
the
conduct
other
members
of
the
house
would
be
highly
relevant.
and
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
i'm
sure
that
the
house
did
not
want
to
afford
him
a
due
process
hearing.
because
they
didn't
want
any
comparative
study
made
and
this
is
indicated
also
about
--
january
3rd
record
of
1969
when
chairman
celler
said
as
to
nepotism,
judge
not
lest,
you
be
judged.
mr.
herbert
o.
reid
no,
sir.
i'm
not
saying
that
mr.
justice
fortas.
what
i
am
saying
that
the
relevant
to
the
expulsion
of
the
one
is
the
conduct
of
others
and
whether
or
not
under
the
equal
cases.
whether
or
not
he
then
has
an
equal
protection
argument
because
of
being
singled
out
and
this
was
highly
relevant
in
the
particular
case
as
well
as
the
conduct
of
other
members.
and
i
think
that
there
is
no
other
justification
for
the
house's
failure
to
accord
him
a
due
process
hearing.
they're
requiring
the
attendance
of
witnesses
and
the
like
other
than
they
wanted
to
avoid
this
comparative
study,
to
which
i
think
he
was
entitled
to.
beyond
the
constitutional
infirmities
of
due
process
and
(inaudible)
which
clearly
are
going
back
to
the
main
part
of
our
argument
would
indicate
that
this
court
had
jurisdiction
and
that
the
issues
were
just
justiciable.
i
want
to
say
a
word
about
mootness
and
remedy.
the
house
has
suggested
that
the
seating
of
congressman
powell
on
january
3,
1969
had
mooted
this
controversy
to
which
we
take
issue
in
our
memorandum
in
our
position
in
which
we
contained
narrow
to
argue
that
the
manner
had
not
been
come
moot.
one,
because
this
is
continuous
conduct,
the
kind
of
continuous
conduct
that
we
had
complained
about
in
the
original
suit.
and
on
january
the
3rd
1969
when
the
motion
which
finally
passed
--
the
motion
which
finally
passed
seating
him
carried
the
findings
from
the
90th
congress
with
no
question
whether
the
same
punishment,
the
same
conduct,
the
same
activity
was
the
basis
of
the
discriminatory
action
which
took
place
on
january
3,
1969.
in
addition,
we
take
the
further
position
that
the
house
could
not
moot
this
case
by
further
unconstitutional
conduct.
therefore,
in
order
for
this
court
to
determine
that
this
case
had
been
mooted
by
the
january
3rd
action
of
the
house.
this
court
would
have
to
find
that
the
january
3rd
resolution
which
seated
him
on
condition
of
paying
of
fine
and
other
limitations
whether
that
action
of
the
house
was
correct.
in
addition
to
the
continuing
conduct,
obviously
as
the
court
suggested
in
bond
case.
we
have
a
question
of
the
backpay
from
the
two
years
in
which
he
was
not
allowed
to
seat.
an
amount
i
think
estimated
by
the
chairman
of
--
mr.
chairman
celler,
as
$55,000.00
but
in
addition,
this
resolution
which
a
levy
to
fine
upon
him.
thereby
adding
the
resolution
of
january
3rd
seated
him
were
clearly
and
then
the
--
against
the
pleadings
of
the
leadership
of
the
house,
mr.
albert,
mr.
celler,
mention
just
a
few
your
honor,
all
suggested
that
the
house
would
not
punish
him
prior
to
seating
him
because
to
do
so
was
to
add
to
the
qualifications.
mr.
kinoy
has
pointed
out.
and
now
the
house
is
now
in
position
of
the
respondent
is
that
this
further
illegal
conduct
moots
this
controversy
to
which
we
take
exception
and
press
before
you
that
this
matter
is
not
moot,
ready
for
the
decision
and
should
be
decided
in
order
to
cover
to
the
matter
of
backpay
as
well
as
the
other
punishment
position
provisions
of
the
resolution.
now,
as
to
remedy
because
the
big
stone
in
bond
in
this
case
all
along
has
been
the
remedy
aspect,
and
whether
the
court
could
enforce
its
mandate.
i
think
the
difficult
in
our
position
since
you
agree
to
took
the
outset,
a
mandamus
was
proper
and
that
we
were
entitled
to
mandamus
from
marbury,
to
the
case
of
marbury
down.
i
think
the
fact
that
the
congressman
had
been
seated
however,
removes
his
difficulty
considerably.
the
--
therefore,
i
think
the
remedy
problem
becomes
much,
much
easier
to
handle
and
to
direct
here
in
terms
of
declaring
the
resolution
278
and
of
march
1,
1967,
and
the
resolution
of
january
3,
1969
unconstitutional.
i
think
that
in
the
light
of
the
--
mr.
herbert
o.
reid
sir
--
mr.
herbert
o.
reid
well,
we
feel
that
it
is
in
number
one,
we
feel
that
this
is
in
part
of
the
illegal
unconstitutional
conduct
for
which
we
had
complained
about
in
the
original
suit.
that
is
the
predicate
sir,
before
the
passage
of
the
resolution
on
january
3rd
was
the
same
conduct.
mr.
herbert
o.
reid
in
fact
of
the
matter,
he
took
the
same
language.
mr.
herbert
o.
reid
no,
it
has
not
sir.
because
this
action
took
place
on
the
matter
it
was
appending
here.
of
course
also,
implicit
in
any
notion
of
mootness
is
the
validity
of
this
action.
in
terms
and
of
the
remedy,
we
feel
that
the
house
cannot
be
anticipated.
the
house
would
not
obey
the
declaration
of
law
by
this
court
as
it
has
from
marbury
through
cooper
and
(inaudible)
and
that
there
is
no
inhibition
to
the
kind
of
remedy
we
seek
here
coming
out
of
the
constitution
itself
with
no
basis
for
believing
that
the
historical
role
of
this
court
in
the
area
of
judicial
review
has
been
that
it
had
judgment
that
it
--
that
in
separation
of
powers
what
had
been
separated
and
given
to
the
judiciary
was
the
matter
of
deciding
cases.
mr.
herbert
o.
reid
sir?
no,
sir.
we
argue
that
we
entitle
to
character
judgment
injunctive
relief
and
we
press
for
mandamus
--
mr.
herbert
o.
reid
well,
mandatory
relief
sir.
in
the
sense
of
the
only
inability
to
the
paying
of
disability
remedy,
to
the
paying
of
this
fine
--
of
paying
of
a
backpay
of
$55,000.00
is
of
course
a
resolution
of
the
house
which
has
directed
the
--
in
effect
that
he
had
not
be
pay
because
he
was
not
seated.
and
as
in
the
mangual
case
--
mr.
herbert
o.
reid
no,
sir.
because
he
was
not
--
mr.
herbert
o.
reid
yes,
sir.
of
the
resolution
278
and
we
are
saying
the
declaration
of
unconstitutionality
as
the
court
did
in
the
mangual
which
we
cite
in
our
reply
brief.
it
--
incidentally,
it
did
not
issue
mandamus
against
the
comptroller
even
if
it
did
--
even
though
it
did
against
another
government
official,
under
the
theory
that
as
soon
as
control
are
read
and
its
opinion,
the
court
itself.
the
mandatory
relief
was
not
necessary
that
he
would
act
accordingly
and
we
amend
as
suggesting
here
that
everything
indicates
to
us
that
in
this
court
exercise
this
historical
judicial
function
and
declares
this
resolution
unconstitutional
that
the
house
would
abide
by
that.
mr.
herbert
o.
reid
yes.
i
think
that
effective
relief
here
at
the
--
by
declaration
of
unconstitutionality
to
said
date.
