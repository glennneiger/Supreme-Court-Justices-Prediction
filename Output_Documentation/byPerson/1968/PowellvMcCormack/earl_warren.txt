chief
justice
earl
warren
judge
bromley,
is
it
a
fact
that
the
speaker
of
the
house
had
already
ruled
that
those
questions
were
not
relevant
to
the
investigation
of
the
committee?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
that
counsel
said
that
prior
of
this
it
was
a
ruling
by
the
speaker
of
the
house
that
the
inquiry
into
his
conduct
while
he
was
in
the
congress
on
this
particular
investigation
was
not
relevant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
misunderstood
probably.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
don't
let
me
interrupt
your
argument
anymore
then.
chief
justice
earl
warren
judge
bromley,
on
your
question
of
mootness.
if
the
court
should
be
of
the
opinion
that
this
action
was
justiciable
originally,
if
it
had
been
timely,
do
you
think
that
it
would
be
moot
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
judge
bromley,
would
your
argument
carry
you
to
the
extent
of
saying
that
if
one
party
was
in
complete
control
of
the
house,
say
it
had
three
--
two-thirds
or
three-fourths
of
all
the
members
that
the
house
and
that
it
could
on
a
proceeding
of
this
kind
refuse
to
seat
all
the
elected
members
of
the
other
party
on
a
ground
that
their
views
were
dangerous
to
the
country
or
on
any
views
so
--
on
any
--
for
any
reasons
that
it
want
to,
would
you
say
that
they
could
do
that
without
any
remedy
whatsoever?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
would
the
remedy
be?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
suppose
they
did
it
one
by
one,
just
one
by
one,
they
take
to
mr.
powell
today
and
on
mr.
smith
tomorrow,
and
on
mr.
jones
the
next
day,
did
it
one
by
one.
where
would
the
remedy
lie?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
it
is
not
harder
case
if
we
have
no
jurisdiction
whatsoever.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
who
draws
that
line?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
then
the
court
has
not
jurisdiction
to
draw
lines.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
could
be
more,
judge
bromley,
what
could
be
more
perverse
than
that
--
than
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
for
instance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
kilbourn
against
thompson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
isn't
seeking
a
place
in
the
house.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now
judge
bromley.
judge
bromley,
you
may
continue
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
wouldn't
it
rather
be
because
of
the
impeachment
clause
rather
than
the
speech
and
debate?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
constitution
does
state
what
the
qualifications
are,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh!
i
thought
it
did?
chief
justice
earl
warren
judge,
suppose
we
had
--
suppose
we
had
the
situation
they
had
in
new
york
after
world
war
1,
where
the
case
in
which
the
chief
justice
hughes
then
out
of
office
interceded
for
five
men
who
were
denied
admission
to
the
new
york
legislature
just
because
they
were
socialist.
now,
suppose
that
same
thing
happened
in
the
congress
today
under
your
argument
would
there
be
any
remedy
for
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
speech
or
debate.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
are
the
qualifications
fix
if
not
by
the
constitution?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
to
say
--
that
is
to
say
that
they
can
fix
any
qualifications
they
want?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
what
are
the
present
qualifications
for
the
admission
of
the
congress?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
and
he've
comply
with
all
of
those?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
other
qualifications
are
there
for
the
office
of
congressman?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
judges
that
that
mean
that
the
--
you
contend
that
congress
by
the
constitution
is
given
the

the
qualifications
for

are
as
well

to
judge
who
whether
he
follows
the
or
he
complies
with
the
qualifications
in
the

chief
justice
earl
warren
where
has
it
been
explored
--
exploit
it
either
in
the
constitution
or
in
our
cases
if
is
it
so
clear?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
was
it
before
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
would
make
a
difference
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
does
a
man
who
is
excluded

as
we
have
here
