of
his
race,
a
former
resolution.
would
say
that
he
would
have
any
judicial
remedy?
justice

and
he
--
would
he
have
traditional
remedy?
justice

how
about
his
back
salary
that
he
would
have
been
paid,
had
he
been
seated,
mr.
bromley?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
bromley,
sounds
to
me
like
in
what
you
say
they
charged
him
with
a
crime
of
embezzlement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
wasn't
it
supposed
to
belong
to
the
united
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
it
did
belong
to
the
united
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
wouldn't
that
be
embezzlement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what
they
punishing
for
that
or
what
were
they
doing
when
they
fined
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
punish.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
not
a
crime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
suppose
they
have
indicted
him,
could
they
have
done
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
couldn't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
seems
to
me
like
what
they've
done
is
to
try
him
for
criminal
offense.
thereby
denying
him
of
his
--
they
would
be
tried
before
a
judge
in
a
jury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
didn't
admit
he
is
guilty,
does
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
is
not
required
to
deny
it,
is
he
under
the
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
that
a
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
what
i
was
thinking
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
probably
be
a
better
place
to
try
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
he
been
seated,
if
he
so
reasonably
been
prevented
from
taking
his
office
because
of
these
what
you
call
crimes?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
there's
a
quite
a
difference
between
those
two
than
that.
quite
a
difference
between
taking
away
his
seniority
which
i
presume
nobody
would
decline
to
say
to
the
congress
they
know
what
to
do
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
fining
for
crimes.
justice
hugo
l.

which
occasion
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
one
--
is
that
the
one
that
stated
that
and
considering
this
was
condition
of
the
constitution,
how
that
could
be
exercise
to
do
something
to
a
man
was
the
least
possible
power
adequate
to
the

justice

you
said

made
his

what
