mr.
don
langston
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
to
start
off
with,
it
should
be
noted
that
from
the
record
in
this
case
that
this
action
was
originated.
in
1965
prior
to
the
administration
of
the
present
attorney
general
and
was
defended
by
him
in
the
states
courts,
the
present
administration
took
over
the
defense
of
this
lawsuit
after
it
was
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
and
was
appealed
to
this
court.
i
think
i
--
mr.
don
langston
i
was
just
--
just
background
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
no
your
honor,
i'm
not
here
prepared
to
say
that.
mr.
don
langston
the
reason
--
the
reason
the
state
of
arkansas
is
involved
in
this
lawsuit
as
you
would
recall
from
the
record,
the
plaintiff
sued
the
little
rock
school
district
and
its
superintendent.
the
reason
the
state
of
arkansas
intervened
in
the
lawsuit
is
that
under
our
declaratory
judgment
act
under
which
mrs.
epperson
assault
to
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional.
the
statute
number
is
34-2510
in
our
code,
it
--
shall
our
declaratory
act,
declaratory
judgment
action
statutes
that
when
a
declaratory
relief
is
sought
in
a
proceeding
seeking
to
have
any
state
statute
declared
unconstitutional,
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
shall
be
served
with
a
copy
of
the
proceeding
and
is
entitled
to
be
heard,
so
that
is
the
reason
why
an
attorney
general's
office
is
involved
in
this
lawsuit
at
this
stage.
mr.
don
langston
yes,
we
have
always
interpreted
that
domain
that
we
are
to
defend
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
your
honor.
i
think
it
should
also
be
noted
from
the
record
that
the
chancery
court
of
alaska
county
filed
and
rendered
a
what
i
would
call
a
rather
lengthy
opinion
for
a
trial
court
in
arkansas
and
we
have
the
benefit
of
its
reasoning
in
this
court.
however,
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
which
ordinarily
and
an
almost
all
of
its
cases
renders
an
opinion
with
reasoning
to
back
it
up
as
failure
to
--
i
shouldn't
say
a
failure
to
but
has
not
filed
an
opinion
which
is
usually
written
by
one
of
its
justices
with
reasoning
for
its
decision.
they
merely
issued
a
per
curiam
opinion
in
this
case
which
they
very
rarely
do
and
i
do
not
know
why
they
did
not
file
a
written
opinion
with
reasoning,
so
therefore
this
court
--
mr.
don
langston
i
have
heard
rumors
to
that
effect
but
i
did
not
think
it's
true.
of
course
sir,
the
second
sentence
in
the
per
curiam
opinion
which
one
of
the
justices
said
he
thought
was
irrelevant
to
the
decision
of
the
case.
if
a
case
was
brought
to
prosecute
a
teacher
under
this
action
i
would
say
that
the
statute
--
that
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
and
the
statute
would
be
interpreted
to
mean
that
to
make
the
student
aware
of
the
theory
not
to
teach
whether
it
was
true
or
untrue
but
just
to
teach
that
there
was
such
a
theory
would
be
the
grounds
for
the
prosecution
under
the
statute
and
that
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas'
opinion
should
be
interpreted
in
that
manner.
mr.
don
langston
that
is
correct
your
honor.
in
our
opinion,
teach
means
to
make
the
student
aware
that
there
is
such
a
theory
and
not
whether
it
is
true
or
untrue.
mr.
don
langston
yes
your
honor.
is
to
mean
that
--
mr.
don
langston
if
i
get
your
question
correct
--
mr.
don
langston
yes.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
if
she
said
that
mrs.
epperson
would
tell
her
students
that
here
is
darwin
theory
that
man
ascended
or
descended
from
a
lower
form
of
being
well,
then
i
think
that
she
would
be,
under
this
statute
would
be
liable
for
prosecution.
mr.
don
langston
i
am
saying
that
i
think
that
the
lower
courts
of
arkansas
would
interpret,
would
hold
that
senate's
irrelevant
your
honor
and
say
that,
although
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
did
not
and
i
think
if
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
would
present
it
with
the
prosecution
under
this
case
that
they
would
disobey
that
second
sentence
in
the
per
curiam
opinion.
mr.
don
langston
yes
your
honor.
i
think
--
mr.
don
langston
i
take
the
first
sentence
of
the
per
curiam
opinion
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
yes
your
honor
and
they
have
not
--
mr.
don
langston
and
they
have
not
decided
the
question
that
i
have
said.
mr.
don
langston
i
think
any
text
supported
school
in
arkansas
will
be
covered.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
graduate
schools
--
mr.
don
langston
no
sir
i
do
not.
mr.
don
langston
of
course,
i
guess
what
you're
getting
at
is
the
impression
of
modern
--
of
younger
children
--
mr.
don
langston
--and
the
children
in
this
but
i
do
not
see
any
distinction
in
this.
i
think
that
anyone
from
kindergarten
and
up
is
not
in
the
public
schools
are
not
suppose
to
be
made
aware
of
this
theory
in
arkansas
and
it
makes
no
difference
how
the
student
is.
mr.
don
langston
yes
sir.
as
to
whether
this
statute
is
vague
and
uncertain
or
not,
of
course
we
alluded
to
this
in
our
brief
and
in
our
basis
for
argument
on
this
is
that
our
statute
was
passed
with
the
case
of
scopes
versus
tennessee
in
maryland
where
in
their
statute
was
held
valid
and
met
the
requirement
that
it
was
not
vague
and
uncertain.
we
think
that
our
statute
is
even
better
worded
than
theirs
and
so
therefore
in
the
light
of
that
decision
in
our
statute
we
think
that
it
meets
the
constitutional
test
to
due
process.
mr.
don
langston
well,
we
feel
that
that
the
state
has
a
right
to
set
the
curriculum
in
its
schools
and
that's
the
--
that's
our
main
point
your
honor
that
the
state
can
prescribe
it's
curriculum
in
schools
and
don't
have
chaos
and
explains
to
that
nature
whenever
in
the
teaching
of
this
courses
there.
i
could
--
another
point
that
could
be
made
there
is
on
our
--
we
say
that
this
is
a
religious
neutrality
act
here,
it
could
keep
the
discussion
of
the
darwin
theory
versus
the
bible
story
out
of
the
teachings
of
the
public
schools
and
keep
them
outside
of
that
form
in
private
forms
and
that
could
go
to
the
orderly
management
of
the
arkansas
students.
mr.
don
langston
i
would
think
that
that
should
be
prohibited,
yes
sir.
mr.
don
langston
to
be
consistent
with
my
argument,
i
would
have
to
say
that
i,
of
course,
i
think
that
the
state
in
prescribing
the
courses
in
the
schools
could
say
what
theories
can
and
cannot
be
taught
there.
mr.
don
langston
of
course
i've
--
there's
--
don't
have
to
be
a
line
drawn
here
somewhere
but
--
of
course
i
wouldn't
move
the
children
of
arkansas
to
--
mr.
don
langston
i
might
say
that
i'm
glad
that
your
problem
and
my
--[laughs]
mr.
don
langston
that
could
be
another
rumor
your
honor.
the
state
of
arkansas
realizes
that
the
trend
in
this
court
and
the
lower
federal
courts
and
to
some
extent
in
the
state
courts
as
to
struck
down
legislation
of
this
sort
which
infringes
somewhat
have
own
private
rights
but
here
we
think
that
we
have
a
--
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
as
to
teaching
geometry
or
anything
of
that
nature,
we
may
not
reasonably
do
it
but
here
we
think
that
we
have
not
been
unreasonable
and
that
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
don
langston
according
to
how
did
--
i
say
your
honor
that
it
does
not
establish
or
this
establish
it
that
as
i
stated
in
my
brief
that
it
is
a
neutrality
act
and
keeps
from
discussing
the
darwin
theory
and
its
opposing
theories
in
the
law,
in
the
schools.
mr.
don
langston
no
it
does
not
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
well,
i
would
first
of
all
hope
that
the
courts
would
--
our
people
would
think
that
that
would
be
an
unreasonable
encroachment
upon
--
mr.
don
langston
well,
of
course
our
position
is
that
the
courts
should
restrain
from
doing
so
as
much
as
possible
because
it
should
be
left
up
to
the
local
school
boards
and
the
local
people
as
to
how
their
schools
should
be
run
and
to
what
curriculum
should
be
taught
yesterday.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
i
have
heard
none
your
honor,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
don
langston
is
that
the
--
mr.
don
langston
english
language?
mr.
don
langston
the
only
way
i
could
do
it
your
honor
would
be
the
reason
at
least
and
unreasonable
aspect
of
it.
the
teaching
of
german
or
teaching
in
english
i
think
in
the
schools
could
be
held
to
be
unreasonable
or
as
keeping
the
darwin
theory
out
of
the
schools
could
be
reasonable
to
keep
from
getting
in
--
mr.
don
langston
--to
maybe
the
religious
aspects
of
the
theory.
mr.
don
langston
yes
sir.
mr.
don
langston
yes
sir,
your
honor.
no,
we
don't
take
that
position
that
it
--
that
this
has
a
religious
aspect
to
it.
do
you
think
the
position
that
has
any
purpose
--
was
there
any
purpose?
i
mean,
if
it
doesn't
serve
a
religious
purpose,
what
purpose
does
it
serve?
mr.
don
langston
well
it,
of
course
whenever
i
say
religious
purpose
i
mean
that
it
could
keep
the
discussion
of
the
bible
story
versus
the
darwinian
story
out
of
the
schools
and
in
the
private
forms
between
scientist
and
your
--
mr.
don
langston
i
supposed
of
the
--
mr.
don
langston
evidently,
all
the
other
theories
--
mr.
don
langston
that
is
correct.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
don
langston
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
to
start
off
with,
it
should
be
noted
that
from
the
record
in
this
case
that
this
action
was
originated.
in
1965
prior
to

of

i
think
i
--
mr.
don
langston
i
was
just
--
just
background
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
no
your
honor,
i'm
not
here
prepared
to
say
that.
mr.
don
langston
the
reason
--
the
reason
the
state
of
arkansas
is
involved
in
this
lawsuit
as
you
would
recall
from
the
record,
the
plaintiff
sued
the
little
rock
school
district
and
its

the
reason
the
state
of
arkansas
intervened
in
the
lawsuit
is
that
under
our
declaratory
judgment
act
under
which
mrs.
epperson
assault
to
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional.
the
statute
number
is
34-2510
in
our
code,
it
--
shall
our
declaratory
act,
declaratory
judgment
action
statutes
that
when
a
declaratory
relief
is
sought
in
a
proceeding
seeking
to
have
any
state
statute
declared
unconstitutional,
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
shall
be
served
with
a
copy
of
the
proceeding
and
is
entitled
to
be
heard,
so
that
is
the
reason
why
an
attorney
general's
office
is
involved
in
this
lawsuit
at
this
stage.
mr.
don
langston
yes,
we
have
always
interpreted
that
domain
that
we
are
to
defend
the
constitutionality
of
this

your

i
think
it
should

that

however,
the

of

which
ordinarily
and
an
almost
all
of
its
cases
renders
an
opinion
with
reasoning
to
back
it
up
as
failure
to
--
i
shouldn't
say
a
failure
to
but
has
not
filed
an
opinion
which
is
usually
written
by
one
of
its
justices
with
reasoning
for
its
decision.
they
merely
issued
a
per

opinion
in
this
case
which
they
very
rarely
do
and
i
do
not
know
why
they
did
not
file
a
written
opinion
with
reasoning,
so
therefore
this
court
--
mr.
don
langston
i
have
heard
rumors
to
that
effect
but
i
did
not
think
it's
true.
of
course
sir,
the
second
sentence
in
the
per
curiam
opinion
which
one
of
the
justices
said
he
thought
was
irrelevant
to
the
decision
of
the
case.
if
a
case
was
brought
to
prosecute
a
teacher
under
this
action
i
would
say
that
the
statute
--
that
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
and
the
statute
would
be
interpreted
to
mean
that
to
make
the
student
aware
of
the
theory
not
to
teach
whether
it
was
true
or
untrue
but
just
to
teach
that
there
was
such
a
theory
would
be
the
grounds
for
the
prosecution
under
the
statute
and
that
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas'
opinion
should
be
interpreted
in
that
manner.
mr.
don
langston
that
is
correct
your
honor.
in
our
opinion,
teach
means
to
make
the
student
aware
that
there
is
such
a
theory
and
not
whether
it
is
true
or
untrue.
mr.
don
langston
yes
your
honor.
is
to
mean
that
--
mr.
don
langston
if
i
get
your
question
correct
--
mr.
don
langston
yes.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
if
she
said
that
mrs.
epperson
would
tell
her
students
that
here
is
darwin

that

then
i
think
that
she

under

would
be
liable
for
prosecution.
mr.
don
langston
i
am
saying
that
i
think
that
the

of

would
interpret,
would
hold
that

although
the

not

i
think
if
the

would
present
it
with
the
prosecution
under
this
case
that
they
would
disobey
that
second
sentence
in
the
per

opinion.
mr.
don
langston
yes
your
honor.
i
think
--
mr.
don
langston
i
take
the
first
sentence
of
the
per
curiam
opinion
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
yes
your
honor
and
they
have
not
--
mr.
don
langston
and
they
have
not
decided
the
question
that
i
have
said.
mr.
don
langston
i
think
any
text
supported
school
in
arkansas
will
be
covered.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.

mr.

no

do

mr.

you're

due
process.
mr.
don
langston
well,
we
feel
that
that
the
state
has
a
right
to
set
the
curriculum
in
its
schools
and
that's
the
--
that's
our
main
point
your
honor
that
the
state
can
prescribe
it's
curriculum
in
schools
and
don't
have
chaos
and
explains
to
that
nature
whenever
in
the
teaching
of
this
courses
there.
i
could
--
another
point
that
could
be
made
there
is
on
our
--
we
say
that
this
is
a
religious
neutrality
act
here,
it
could
keep
the
discussion
of
the
darwin
theory
versus
the
bible
story
out
of
the
teachings
of
the
public
schools
and
keep
them
outside
of
that
form
in
private
forms
and
that
could
go
to
the
orderly
management
of
the
arkansas
students.
mr.
don
langston
i
would
think
that
that
should
be
prohibited,
yes
sir.
mr.
don
langston
to
be
consistent
with
my
argument,
i
would
have
to
say
that
i,
of
course,
i
think
that
the
state
in
prescribing
the
courses
in
the
schools
could
say
what
theories
can
and
cannot
be
taught
there.
mr.
don
langston
of
course
i've
--
there's
--
don't
have
to
be
a
line
drawn
here
somewhere
but
--
of
course
i
wouldn't
move
the
children
of
arkansas
to
--
mr.
don
langston
i
might
say
that
i'm
glad
that
your
problem
and
my
--[laughs]
mr.
don
langston
that
could
be
another
rumor
your
honor.
the
state
of
arkansas
realizes
that
the
trend
in
this
court
and
the
lower
federal
courts
and
to
some
extent
in
the
state
courts
as
to
struck
down
legislation
of
this
sort
which
infringes
somewhat
have
own
private
rights
but
here
we
think
that
we
have
a
--
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
as
to
teaching
geometry
or
anything
of
that
nature,
we
may
not
reasonably
do
it
but
here
we
think
that
we
have
not
been
unreasonable
and
that
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
don
langston
according
to
how
did
--
i
say
your
honor
that
it
does
not
establish
or
this
establish
it
that
as
i
stated
in
my
brief
that
it
is
a
neutrality
act
and
keeps
from
discussing
the
darwin
theory
and
its
opposing
theories
in
the
law,
in
the
schools.
mr.
don
langston
no
it
does
not
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
well,
i
would
first
of
all
hope
that
the
courts
would
--
our
people
would
think
that
that
would
be
an
unreasonable
encroachment
upon
--
mr.
don
langston
well,
of
course
our
position
is
that
the
courts
should
restrain
from
doing
so
as
much
as
possible
because
it
should
be
left
up
to
the
local
school
boards
and
the
local
people
as
to
how
their
schools
should
be
run
and
to
what
curriculum
should
be
taught
yesterday.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
i
have
heard
none
your
honor,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
don
langston
is
that
the
--
mr.
don
langston
english
language?
mr.
don
langston
the
only
way
i
could
do
it
your
honor
would
be
the
reason
at
least
and
unreasonable
aspect
of
it.
the
teaching
of
german
or
teaching
in
english
i
think
in
the
schools
could
be
held
to
be
unreasonable
or
as
keeping
the
darwin
theory
out
of
the
schools
could
be
reasonable
to
keep
from
getting
in
--
mr.
don
langston
--to
maybe
the
religious
aspects
of
the
theory.
mr.
don
langston
yes
sir.
mr.
don
langston
yes
sir,
your
honor.
no,
we
don't
take
that
position
that
it
--
that
this
has
a
religious
aspect
to
it.
do
you
think
the
position
that
has
any
purpose
--
was
there
any
purpose?
i
mean,
if
it
doesn't
serve
a
religious
purpose,
what
purpose
does
it
serve?
mr.
don
langston
well
it,
of
course
whenever
i
say
religious
purpose
i
mean
that
it
could
keep
the
discussion
of
the
bible
story
versus
the
darwinian
story
out
of
the
schools
and
in
the
private
forms
between
scientist
and
your
--
mr.
don
langston
i
supposed
of
the
--
mr.
don
langston
evidently,
all
the
other
theories
--
mr.
don
langston
that
is
correct.
thank
you
sir.
