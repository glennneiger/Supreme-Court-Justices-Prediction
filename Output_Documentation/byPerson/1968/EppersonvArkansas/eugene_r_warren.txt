mr.

mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
constitutionality
of
the
arkansas
anti-evolution
law.
mrs.
susan
epperson,
a
teacher
an
h.h.
blanchard,
the
father
of
two
would
be
learners
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
the
initiated
act
number
1
of
1926,
which
was
the
so-called
monkey
bill
of
the
anti-evolution
law.
a
challenge
was
based
upon
the
contention
that
the
act
violated
and
collided
with
the
first
amendment
freedoms
to
freedom
of
speech,
the
freedom
to
teach
and
to
learn,
the
freedom
and
the
question
of
freedom
of
religion,
the
question
of
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
we
have
briefed
these
points
as
well
as
we
possibly
can.
we
have
the
benefit
of
supporting
briefs
of
amicus
to
excellent
briefs
and
i
shall
not
burden
or
impose
upon
the
time
of
the
patient
of
this
court
to
argue
to
any
great
extent
the
question
of
the
first
amendment
freedom
is
what
i
would
like
to
discuss
with
emphasis
--
greater
emphasis
that
in
our
brief,
the
question
of
the
vagueness
of
the
act
that
is
the
failure
of
the
act
to
meet
the
permissible
statutory
vagueness
of
the
due
process
clause.
from
the
time
that
this
act
was
enacted
or
adopted,
teachers
were
in
arkansas
were
in
--
have
been
and
are
genuinely
confused
and
concerned,
uncertain
as
to
whether
or
not
the
language
of
the
act
which
forbid
the
teacher
to
teach
the
theory
or
doctrine
that
man
ascended
or
descended
from
a
lower
form
of
animals.
whether
that
language
forbid
the
teacher
to
discuss
the
matter
or
permit
the
theory
or
permit
a
classroom
from
discussion
of
the
theory
or
whether
the
actual
meaning
of
the
act
was
that
the
teacher
could
not
teach
that
the
theory
was
--
had
been
established
or
it
was
true.
now,
at
the
time
of
the
trial
of
this
case
and
the
lower
court,
the
plaintiff
mrs.
epperson
testified
that
she
did
not
wish
to
teach
that
the
theory
was
true
but
simply
to
explain
it
because
it
was
contained
in
a
chapter
in
the
biology
of
book
that
had
been
furnished
to
her
by
the
local
school
district.
may
i
say
that
in
my
--
as
i
understand
it,
there
is
simply
is
no
biology
textbook
that
does
not
have
some
references
or
some
explanation
of
the
theory
of
the
evolution
of
man.
judge
reed,
the
trial
judge
committed
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
language
of
the
act
permitted
a
discussion
of
the
act
of
whether
it
forbid
the
teaching
of
the,
that
the
theory
was
true.
we
devoted
12
pages
in
our
brief
and
the
arkansas
supreme
court
to
a
discussion
of
statutory
vagueness
under
the
due
process
clause.
it
--
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
in
a
two
line
opinion,
memorandum
opinion
held
that
this
was
a
proper
exercise
or
valid
exercise,
this
act
was
a
valid
exercise
of
the
power
of
state
to
control
the
curriculum
of
the
schools.
mr.
eugene
r.
warren
yes
sir.
mr.
eugene
r.
warren
yes.--
mr.
eugene
r.
warren
i
would
take
the
same
position
but
not
quite
as
strongly.
mr.
eugene
r.
warren
well,
i
think
that
the
case
of
the
bartels,
an
iowa
case
where
the
--
that
was
the
iowa
case
and
the
nebraska
case,
meyer
case
that
those
statute
prohibiting
the
teaching
of
german
only
applied
to
the
elementary
schools
and
this
court
in
those
two
cases
struck
down
those
axe
under
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
eugene
r.
warren
the
--
in
meyer
case
was
a
public
school.
mr.
eugene
r.
warren
yeah.
mr.
eugene
r.
warren
yes
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
would
think
--
mr.
eugene
r.
warren
no
sir
i
take
the
position
that
the
curriculum
of
the
public
schools
even
the
elementary
grade
is
not
a
matter
for
the
ballot
but
is
a
matter
of
for
the
proper
educational
officers.
mr.
eugene
r.
warren
well,
i
think
--
mr.
eugene
r.
warren
yes
i
think
that
clearly
be
unconstitutional,
i
certainly
do.
mr.
eugene
r.
warren
of
the
age.
mr.
eugene
r.
warren
i
must
say
that
i
believe
that
these
are
matters
for
educators
and
not
for
the
ballot
but
as
i
have
to
go
back
when
the
supreme
--
when
this
case
was
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas,
it
made
the
statement
in
the
second
line
that
the
court
--
that
we
do
not
decide
whether
the
act
forbids
the
discussion
or
explanation
of
the
theory
are
forbids
whether
the
theory
was
true.
now,
this
is
--
this
in
itself
condemns
the
act,
certainly
makes
it
vague.
the
teacher
should
not
be
required
particularly
where
this
is
a
penal
act
at
--
where
conviction
requires
that
the
dismissal
of
the
teacher
from
the
school
from
her
profession,
from
her
job.
the
teachers
shouldn't
be
required
to
take
this
gamble.
mr.
eugene

$500.00
fine,
yes

mr.

26.
mr.
eugene
r.
warren
mr.
justice
fortas,
to
my
knowledge
there
has
not
been.
there
has
been
-
there
have
been
threats
of
prosecution
and
there
have
been
some
cases
started
but
i
don't
think
they
will
ever
conclude
it.
one
other
field
of
uncertainly
in
the
--
mr.
eugene
r.
warren
sir?
mr.
eugene
r.
warren
i
don't
know
mr.
justice
black,
i
just
really
hate
to
say
whether
there
was
any
danger
or
not,
there
was
a
lot
--
there's
a
lot
of
uncertainty
and
a
lot
of
fright.
i
think
the
act
was
used
mostly
for
bogyman.
in
a
number
of
districts
in
arkansas,
the
subject
of
biology
is
not
even
taught.
in
other
districts
in
arkansas,
of
course
the
biology
book
does
have
a
chapter,
all
biology
books
i
understand
do
have
a
chapter.
when
the
teacher
reaches
that
chapter,
the
teacher
simply
skips
it
unless
the
teacher
happens
to
be
one
of
those
ingenious
people
that
wants
to
be
sure
that
the
student
actually
reads
it,
a
teacher
analysis
that
that
the
reading
of
this
chapter
is
illegal
and
of
course
i
think
all
of
the
children
immediately
would
want
to
read
and
probably
get
more
from
that
chapter
than
any
other
chapter
in
the
book.
the
language
of
the
act
also
forbids
the
teacher
to
use
a
textbook
in
which
this
theory
is
--
as
the
access
a
textbook
which
teaches
the
theory
or
doctrine.
now,
as
i
understand
the
word
use
if
the
teacher
refers
a
student
to
a
particular
book
or
a
textbook,
the
teacher
is
using
that
book
not
only
the
student
that
actually
consults
the
book
but
also
the
teacher
by
referring
the
student
to
it.
well,
our
webster
is
an
international
dictionary,
contains
an
explanation.
webster's
collegiate

all
the

is

of

all
the
source
reference
books,
general
reference
book
in
every
schools
library
contains
an
explanation
of
this
theory.
when
i
--
if
the
act
has
that
sort
of
meaning
then
that
means
that
every
school
has
got
to
rid
library
of
all
of
these
books
and
that
just
plain
ridiculous.
that's
book
burning
at
its
worst.
mr.
eugene
r.
warren
well,
the
statute
has
not
been
--
has
not
been
--
at
school
those
--
mr.
eugene
r.
warren
to
use,
a
teacher
to
use
or
a
textbook
commissioned
to
adapt.
mr.
eugene
r.
warren
well,
the
dictionary
in
arkansas
has
been
adapted
as
a
textbook
and
is
furnished
under
the
textbook
law.
so,
that
a
teacher
couldn't
refer
under
that
--
under
that
construction
of
that
which
is
clearly
vague,
clearly
uncertain
a
teacher
couldn't
refer
a
student
to
the
dictionary
for
fear
that
that
student
inadvertently
might
turn
to
the
page
that
had
the
explanation
of
evolution
on
it
and
then
the
teacher
is
subject
to
dismissal
from
her
position
and
we
say
that
the
act
is
clearly
clearly
vague,
clearly
unconstitutional.
may
i
reserve
--
mr.
eugene
r.
warren
i
see
no
difference,
not
much
was.
thank
you.

and
that
just
plain
ridiculous.
that's
book
burning
at
its
worst.
mr.
eugene
r.
warren
well,
the
statute
has
not
been
--
has
not
been
--
at
school
those
--
mr.
eugene
r.
warren
to
use,
a
teacher
to
use
or
a
textbook
commissioned
to
adapt.
mr.
eugene
r.
warren
well,
the
dictionary
in
arkansas
has
been
adapted
as
a
textbook
and
is
furnished
under
the
textbook
law.
so,
that
a
teacher
couldn't
refer
under
that
--
under
that
construction
of
that
which
is
clearly
vague,
clearly
uncertain
a
teacher
couldn't
refer
a
student
to
the
dictionary
for
fear
that
that
student
inadvertently
might
turn
to
the
page
that
had
the
explanation
of
evolution
on
it
and
then
the
teacher
is
subject
to
dismissal
from
her
position
and
we
say
that
the
act
is
clearly
clearly
vague,
clearly
unconstitutional.
may
i
reserve
--
mr.
eugene
r.
warren
i
see
no
difference,
not
much
was.
thank
you.
mr.
eugene
r.
warren
mr.
chief
justice,
with
your
permission
may
we
submit
the
case
as
is.
