unknown
speaker
but
those
were
private
schools?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
right,
my
--
unknown
speaker
well,
did
you
say
--
has
the
statute
been
constituted
to
which
you're
referring,
the
teachers
referring
to
--
unknown
speaker
on
its
face
it
seems
--
on
its
face
it
seems
that
we
generally
makes
it
unlawful
for
any
teacher
to
adapt
or
use
in
the
institution.
unknown
speaker
well,
does
not
mean
like,
ordinarily
our
textbooks
formally
adapted
for
use
in
the
given
class
or
by
--
in
the
teaching
of
a
given
course?
unknown
speaker
do
you
see
any
different
before
you
sit
down
mr.
warren,
do
you
see
any
difference
between
--
is
it
a
matter
of
law
between
this
case
meyer
against
nebraska?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
significance
with
that?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
just
thought
you
were
telling
us
your
administration
doesn't
like
the
statute
either.
unknown
speaker
it
might
not
be
too
late
you
know.
unknown
speaker
indefinitely
even
the
class
this
year?
unknown
speaker
maybe
they
couldn't
mr.
langston.
unknown
speaker
should
be
interpreted
to
the
effect
that
there
is
a
criminal
offense
for
a
teacher
to
make
students
aware
that
there
is
such
a
theory?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
we
should
take
the
arkansas
statute
as
meaning
that
--
unknown
speaker
and
as
meaning
that
it
does
really
--
it
does
--
it
does
reach
the
teaching
about
as
well
as
affirmatively
teaching
the
rightness
of
something?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
it
would
cover
a
teacher
telling
about
--
telling
about
darwin
--
unknown
speaker
--
as
well
as
--
as
well
as
teaching
that
darwin
was
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
have
some
trouble
with
that
and
the
same
as
to
my
--
you
mean
you
get
that
out
of
the
second
sentence,
the
court
expresses
no
opinion
on
the
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean,
this
has
only
been
suggested
to
you
on
problem
i
take
it
is
to
decide
the
constitutional
question
on
the
basis
of
the
authoritative
interpretation
of
the
statute
by
the
highest
state
court,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
now,
what
are
we
to
take
to
be
the
authoritative
interpretation
of
this
statute
for
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
that
it's
a
valid
exercise
or
the
state's
power
to
specify
the
quick
1839
public
schools?
unknown
speaker
well,
--
unknown
speaker
no,
but
what
concerns
me,
going
back
to
the
question
i
asked
your
adversary
earlier,
are
we
to
take
this
to
mean
that
as
much
as
i
have
said
is
this
statute
is
valid
as
regarding
--
as
regards
to
quick
limit
at
public
schools
meaning
primary
schools
or
does
this
mean
that
if
valid
as
regards
to
teaching
and
in
the
university
college,
normal
public
school
or
other
institutions?
unknown
speaker
so
public
schools
here
include
university
college,
normal
--
unknown
speaker
well
then,
may
i
ask
you
the
question
i
asked
your
adversary
earlier.
if
that's
the
interpretation
against
which
we're
to
test
the
constitution
in
the
first
amendment.
do
you
see
a
difference
between
that
kind
of
prohibition
in
dealing
with
adults
at
universities,
college,
normal
and
public
school
and
that
kind
of
prohibition
dealing
with
children
in
the
primary
grades?
unknown
speaker
see
none.
you
don't
think
butler
and
michigan
has
any
analogy
here
too,
that's
the
one
in
which
we
held
at
in
the
area
of
obscenity,
you
can't
measure
the
reading
of
adults
by
the
standard
of
what's
fit
for
children
to
read.
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
what
you're
defending
it
on
the
ground
that
it's
constitutional
do
deny
any
teachers
the
right
to
teach
this
even
the
normal
school
of
college,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
state
interest
that
you're
protecting
through
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
would
you
in
the
same
ground
defend
the
statute
to
prohibit
the
teaching
of
the
theory
that
some
races
are
inferior
to
others?
unknown
speaker
that
that
could
constitutionally
be
done?
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose
--
on
that
--
on
that
theory,
would
you
think
that
the
state
could
provide
the
index
mathematical
courses
would
be
illegal
to
mention
or
teach
geometry?
unknown
speaker
that's
our
problem
too.
unknown
speaker
apparently
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
felt
the
same
way.[laughs]
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
say
about
the
rest
of
the
--
unknown
speaker
it
says
anything
about
its
opposing
theory,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
it
simply
forbids
the
teaching
of
--
to
say
the
darwinian
theory,
doesn't
it?
isn't
it
rather
similar
to
statute
what
so
--
what
if
arkansas
would
forbid
the
--
forbid
teaching
the
theory
that
the
world
is
round
for
instance?
unknown
speaker
but
why?
why
should
we
get
into
the
school
or
any
school
--
unknown
speaker
well,
this
isn't
a
kind
of
a
case
that
would
be
presented.
if
arkansas
had
provided
that
all
the
public
schools
teach
american
history
or
teach
the
history
of
arkansas,
or
it
teach
mathematics,
or
teach
a
foreign
language,
or
teach
a
chemistry,
or
english
grammar,
this
hasn't
to
have
to
do
with
subjects
to
be
taught,
this
has
to
do
with
a
particular
theory
that
shall
not
be
taught?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
subject
sex,
does
arkansas
have
any
prohibitions
on
teaching
in
the
field
of
sex?
unknown
speaker
mr.
langston
i
appreciate
your
problem
here.
appreciate
the
way
you
presented
this
to
us
but
i
wanted
to
ask
you
just
one
question.
do
you
see
any
way
in
which
this
case
can
be
distinguished
from
meyer
against
nebraska
which
this
court
decided
in
the
1923?
unknown
speaker
german
language?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
a
few
moments
ago
maybe
at
worse
and
then
invoking
some
maybe
i
misunderstood
you
but
i
thought
a
few
moments
ago
you
said
that
you
indicated
the
reason
for
privating
the
teaching
of
the
darwinian
theory
was
so
that
it
would
not
collide
with
the
--
what
i
believe
you
referred
to
as
the
bible
story
in
which
i
assume
you
mean
the
literal
reading
of
the
book
of
genesis?
unknown
speaker
and
it
is
--
does
the
state
concede
that
that
is
a
purpose
of
this
prohibition?
if
it
does,
it
run
right
into
the
question
of
the
first
amendment,
wouldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
so
that
the
bible
story
couldn't
be
discussed
in
the
schools?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
as
my
brother
stewart
i
think
suggested,
there's
no
general
prohibition
as
there
against
discussing
how
man
came
to
be
and
his
origins
has
no
general
prohibition.
so
that
theories
such
as
including
the
bible
that
literal
reading
of
genesis
could
be
discussed
in
the
schools
and
the
other
theory
if
there
is
any
other
except
for
the
darwin
and
theories,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
out
of
that
whole
area
of
the
origin
of
man,
arkansas
has
excised
only
a
segment.
that
segment
being
the
darwinian
theory,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
but
those
were
private
schools?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
right,
my
--
unknown
speaker
well,
did
you
say
--
has
the
statute
been

to
which
you're
