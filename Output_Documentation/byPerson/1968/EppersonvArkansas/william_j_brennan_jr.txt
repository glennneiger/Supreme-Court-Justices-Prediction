mr.
warren
may
i
ask?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
be
taking
the
same
position
under
the
first
amendment
if
these
statute
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
as
i
--
as
i
read
it,
it
says
that
it's
unlawful
to
teach
in
any
university
college,
normal
public
schools
and
so
forth.
if
instead
it
had
just
said
that
it
would
be
unlawful
to
teach
children
in
grades,
primary
grades
one
through
six.
would
you
take
the
same
position
on
the
first
term?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
understand.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you're
familiar,
i
don't
know
that
you
cited
it
with
--
old
decisions
in
the
obscenity
area,
for
example
in
the
ginsburg
case
of
last
term
and
the
--

buffer
and
michigan
and
those
cases.
but
at
least
in
that
area
have
drawn
some
lines
depending
upon
the
ages
of
the
children
exposed
to
the
material
that
involved
and
you
don't
think
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
take
that
same
kind
of
line
could
be
drawn?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
you
had
a
statute
that
just
said
that
it
shall
be
unlawful
to
teach
in
grades
one
through
six
depending
on
the
color
of
the
skin,
one
race
is
inferior
to
another
race.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
that
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you
don't
think
any
lines
can
be
drawn
at
all
depending
upon
the
level
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

--of
the
education,
primary
versus
high
school
and
so
on.
