mr.
arlen
specter
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
may
it
please
the
court.
taking
up
first
the
initial
argument
advanced
by
the
petitioner
with
respect
to
the
statements
by
the
district
attorney
in
the
opening
speech.
i
think
that
the
record
makes
it
perfectly
plain
that
this
item
is
even
less
than
what
has
been
characterized
by
this
court
to
be
a
minor
lapse
in
the
course
of
a
very
extensive
criminal
trial.
the
statement
made
by
the
district
attorney
at
the
outset,
amount
of
the
sum
two
pages
in
the
record
and
five
lines.
the
portion
of
the
transcript
where
the
co-indictee
rawls
was
called
to
the
stand
--
mr.
arlen
specter
i'm
representing
the
respondent
that
i've
been
asked
to
do
so
mr.
justice
douglas.
the
national
district
attorney's
association
asked
if
i
would
represent
the
respondent
here.
mr.
arlen
specter
yes,
sir.
mr.
arlen
specter
no,
mr.
chief
justice
warren.
i
speak
that
is
how
i
came
to
be
in
the
case
but
i
am
here
at
the
request
of
the
state
of
oregon,
to
represent
the
state
of
oregon
and
i
did
not
speak
for
the
national
--
mr.
arlen
specter
the
request
was
made
up
by
a
roger
rook,
the
district
attorney
of
clackamas
county
who's
in
the
courtroom
today.
mr.
arlen
specter
it
is
my
understanding
that
it
is
the
responsibility
of
mr.
rook
to
represent
himself
here,
represent
clackamas
county
in
the
state
of
oregon
and
he
has
--
mr.
arlen
specter
i
think
i
have
best
turn
to
mr.
rook
to
get
confirmation
of
it.
mr.
arlen
specter
well,
mr.
chief
justice
warren
i
am
thoroughly
familiar
with
all
of
the
matters
which
are
raised
in
this
case.
i
think
both
as
to
the
federal
principles
amnesty
oregon
principles
and
i
have
consulted
with
mr.
rook
about
the
oregon
principles
and
his
availability
here
is
certainly
would
enable
me
to
respond
to
any
question
which
might
arise
as
to
the
oregon
principles.
i
have
advised
the
clerk
of
my
position
mr.
chief
justice
warren
and
made
it
plaint
that
i
was
coming
in
as
a
counsel
in
the
case,
not
being
an
oregon
attorney,
being
a
philadelphia
pennsylvania
attorney.
so
that
i
made
every
effort
to
make
plain
my
position
here
sir.
mr.
arlen
specter
correct
your
honor,
i'm
here
representing
the
respondent
only,
yes
sir.
mr.
arlen
specter
the
point
that
i
think
is
most
important
on
the
first
argument
of
the
petitioner
is
that
the
entire
sequence
of
events
concerning
the
opening
statement
made
by
mr.
rook
and
the
amount
of
time
that
the
co-indictee
was
on
the
stand
involved
a
very
small
portion
of
this
extensive
trial.
measured
by
the
transcript
itself,
the
opening
statement
amounted
to
two
pages
and
five
lines
and
the
time
when
rawls
was
on
the
stand
amounted
to
somewhat
less
than
three
pages.
the
total
of
some
five
pages
on
a
transcript
which
runs
more
than
1,000
pages.
now
this
item
accounted
for
no
more
than
one
half
of
1%
of
this
entire
trial.
the
questions
which
were
asked
of
mr.
rawls
when
he
took
the
stand
amounted
to
only
two
in
number
and
neither
of
which
was
incriminating.
substantially
less
than
that
which
was
asked
of
the
witnesses
in
namet
versus
the
united
states
when
there
were
four
and
where
those
questions
did
go
to
incriminating
items.
the
reference
made
by
mr.
rook
in
his
opening
speech
did
not
involve
any
direct
reference
to
a
confession
at
all.
there
was
a
reference
to
a
statement
and
there
was
not
even
a
clear
reference
to
a
written
statement
and
the
matter
was
raised
immediately
after
the
opening
statement
on
the
defendant's
motion
for
a
mistrial
and
as
it
appears
on
page
48
of
the
printed
transcript.
the
court
noted,
“it
wasn't
my
observation
that
the
district
attorney
was
reading
from
any
statement,
i
don't
know
were
you
mr.
rook?”
and
mr.
rook
responded,
“i
was
not,
i
was
referring
to
it.”
mr.
arlen
specter
yes
your
honor,
he
did
have
it
in
his
hand.
as
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
he
had
many
papers
in
his
hands
as
he
was
making
his
opening
statement
but
he
never
referred
to
it
as
a
confession
and
he
--
mr.
arlen
specter
he
had
in
his
hands
--
mr.
arlen
specter
no,
no,
so
that
he
could
be
accurate
in
terms
of
what
he
was
saying.
in
the
course
of
his
opening
statement,
he
is
very
careful
in
quite
a
number
of
places
to
be
a
circumspect
in
the
positiveness
with
which
he
makes
representations
and
i
think
that
point
is
a
very
significant
one
in
terms
of
the
quality
of
that
opening
statement
where
he
does
not
speak
of
evidence
or
speak
of
facts
but
speaks
of
what
a
prosecutor
intends
to
prove
and
i
think
mr.
rook
makes
that
very
plain
throughout
the
entirety
of
his
opening
statement.
and
i
if
i
could
cite
just
a
few
examples
of
that
at
page
30
he
says,
“i
haven't
personally
talked
with
the
witnesses
that
the
state
has
and
i
don't
know
what
it
looks
like.”
and
on
page
31
he
says,
“i
think
our
testimony
will
be.”
and
on
page
33
he
says,
“i
think
that
the
evidence
will
show.”
on
page
35
he
says,
“i
don't
recall
what
it
is”
and
a
little
further
down
he
points
out,
“if
my
memory
serves
me
right
is
that
throughout
the
entire
presentation
of
mr.
rook,
he
is
doing
what
any
lawyer
does
in
an
opening
statement.
he
is
outlining
what
he
intends
to
prove
which
is
something
very
different
from
having
a
witness
on
the
stand
as
there
was
a
witness
on
the
stand
in
douglas
where
the
prosecutor
goes
over
a
statement.”
and
after
a
plea
and
says,
“now
isn't
this
what
you
said
to
which
the
witness
consistently
responds
with
a
plea
of
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment
where
this
is
enormously
different
from
what
happened
in
bruton
where
there
is
a
co-defendant
in
the
course
of
robbery
case
who
testifies
and
there
is
a
cautionary
instruction.”
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
that
in
the
context
of
the
opening,
there
were
two
other
matters
deemed
by
the
defense
lawyer
to
be
of
substantial
importance
where
as
the
comments
which
mr.
rook
made
about
the
testimony
that
he
intended
to
produce
from
mr.
rawls
was
not
objected
to
at
all
in
the
course
of
that
opening
statement.
although
it
was
one
of
the
grounds
for
a
mistrial
advanced
by
defense
counsel
immediately
after
the
opening
statement
was
concluded
so
i'm
not
saying
that
there
was
no
timely
objection
made.
i'm
merely
putting
it
in
the
context
of
the
opening
statement
where
there
was
an
interruption
and
an
objection
by
defense
counsel
on
the
question
of
mr.
rook's
intention
to
use
the
statement
of
the
defendant
mr.
frazier
and
there
was
an
eruption
and
objection
by
defense
counsel
on
the
reference
to
the
items
of
clothing
which
had
been
the
subject
of
search
and
seizure.
but
when
it
came
to
this
question
about
mr.
rook's
reference
to
what
he
intended
to
produce
through
the
testimony
of
the
co-defendant.
there
was
at
that
point
no
objection
at
all.
mr.
arlen
specter
yes,
sir.
mr.
arlen
specter
the
basis
for
the
motion
at
that
time
mr.
justice
harlan
was
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
mr.
rook
had
reason
to
know
that
the
witness
mr.
rawls
would
not
taken
stand
and
therefore
or
would
plead
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
therefore
it
would
not
be
before
the
jury.
and
this
matter
was
inquired
into
fully
and
appears
in
terms
of
mr.
rook's
reply
at
page
82
for
the
transcript
and
mr.
rook
made
reference
to
three
specific
reasons
why
he
believe
that
mr.
rawls
was
going
to
testify.
and
those
three
reasons
were,
number
one,
that
lieutenant
thomas
of
the
sheriff's
office
reported
to
me
this
is
his
testimony
“that
he
felt
sure
that
mr.
rawls
was
going
to
testify.
next,
he
receives
statement
from
mr.
ore
of
the
probation
office
that
mr.
rawls
was
going
to
testify
and
did
not
want
to
take
the
fifth.
and
third,
that
rawls'
two
brothers
and
or
mother
--
i
am
not
sure
of
that;
i'm
reading
from
the
record
here
at
least
two
of
them
or
three
of
them
had
talked
to
him
and
advised
me
that
although
counsel
advised
him
not
to
testify,
he
thought
he
wanted
to
testify
and
he
was
going
to
testify.
and
mr.
rook,
on
the
next
page
says
i'm
talking
about
the
information
i
had
in
my
head
at
the
time
that
these
events
occurred
and
it
is
of
course
not
of
unusual
procedure
for
a
defense
counsel
thinking
based
on
information
which
he
may
have
had
perhaps
in
an
earlier
date
of
that
the
plea
of
privilege
would
be
entered
to
attempt
to
dissuade
a
prosecutor
from
going
ahead
with
that
line
of
evidence.
mr.
arlen
specter
these
references
mr.
justice
harlan
took
place
immediately
after
mr.
rawls
was
placed
on
the
stand
so
that
there
was
a
detailing
in
terms
of
what
mr.
rook
which
i
would
think
the
more
germane
time
when
he
actually
put
him
on
the
stand
and
that
is
what
he
had
as
he
put
it
in
his
head
at
that
time.
i
think
that
if
the
petitioner's
point
is
adopted
on
this
line
that
there
would
be
a
very
substantial
undercutting
of
the
prosecutor's
right
to
make
an
opening
speech
and
i
think
this
case
illustrates
it
very
well
because
there
were
objections
made
to
three
points;
two
of
them
actually
during
the
course
of
the
speech
and
the
third
one
afterwards.
on
three
of
the
essential
points
of
evidence
which
the
prosecutor
was
going
to
put
forward;
first,
the
defendant's
statement
itself,
secondly,
the
expected
testimony
of
a
co-defendant
and
third,
an
outline
of
the
evidence
which
have
been
subject
to
search
and
seizure.
now,
anyone
of
these
points
might
have
been
rendered
inadmissible
although
the
search
and
seizure
point
had
been
cleared
for
a
pretrial
motion.
but
if
we
would
to
take
the
position
of
defense
counsel
at
the
trial
that
a
prosecutor
could
not
go
into
these
items.
it
is
claimed
from
this
case
that
the
major
substance
of
what
the
prosecutor
was
going
to
talk
about
to
the
jury
would
be
stricken
from
the
scope
of
his
opening
speech.
and
i
think
that
the
right
in
the
prosecutor
to
make
the
opening
outline
is
a
very
crucial
one
when
the
prosecution
has
the
burden
of
proof
when
the
facts
very
frequently
or
disjointed
when
there
has
to
be
some
outline
to
be
followed
to
give
the
jury
some
thread
as
to
what
is
coming
and
how
they
fit
into
the
overall
picture
disconnected
bits
of
evidence.
and
if
the
defense
position
were
to
be
upheld
here
and
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
think
it
is
perfectly
plain
that
--
mr.
arlen
specter
well,
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
i
think
because
there
has
to
be
a
thread
is
to
what
happened
when
the
three
men
were
together,
mr.
frazier,
mr.
rawls
and
mr.
marleau
that
is
crucial
time
in
this
case.
i
would
want
to
make
one
thing
perfectly
plain
and
that
is
that
mr.
rook
never
referred
to
a
confession
of
call
by
mr.
rawls.
never
said
it
was
a
confession.
he
said,
“rawls
have
made
the
statement”
and
i
think
it
is
a
fair
inference,
mr.
justice
marshall
points
out
that
he
had
a
written
statement
to
that
effect
but
he
never
said
it
was
a
confession.
and
he
then
proceeded
to
outline
what
happened
when
those
three
men
were
together.
he
faced
precisely
that
problem
when
he
was
to
make
references
to
the
statement
of
the
defendant
mr.
frazier.
there
again,
he
had
identical
problems,
how
much
detail
does
a
prosecutor
go
into
in
outlining
what
he
intends
to
prove
through
that
witness.
and
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
you
really
have
to
at
that
point
tell
them
what
is
going
to
transpire
in
the
case
if
they're
going
to
be
able
to
piece
together
all
of
the
detail
facts
which
are
present.
mr.
arlen
specter
i'm
saying
yes.
the
testimony
is
important
had
it
got
in
but
our
--
mr.
arlen
specter
yes
sir.
i'm
arguing
that
it
is
one
of
three
crucial
parts
of
the
prosecutor's
case
but
the
way
it
unfolded
before
this
jury
it
was
not
put
before
this
jury
to
any
significant
extent.
it
was
put
to
the
jury
in
a
very,
very
abbreviated
form
in
five
pages
out
of
a
1000-page
record.
and
that
is
why
i
say
even
though
this
point
was
crucial
important
to
the
prosecution,
it
was
not
put
before
the
jury
in
any
detail
at
all
and
the
record
will
show
that
out
of
an
opening
speech
of
some
28
pages
in
the
transcript
this
occupied
about
one-seventh.
mr.
arlen
specter
well,
--
mr.
arlen
specter
yes,
sir.
i
submit
that
it
would.
i
respectfully
submit
that
it
would
because
how
is
a
prosecutor
to
know
when
he
is
making
his
opening
speech,
what
evidence
is
not
going
to
be
available
to
him
that
afternoon
or
the
next
day
or
a
week
later.
there
may
be
a
death
of
a
witness,
there
may
be
a
witness
who
fleas
the
jurisdiction,
there
may
be
--
mr.
arlen
specter
no
sir.
no,
it
is
not
but
this
is
the
import
i
submit
to
your
honor
as
to
what
would
happen
here
or
a
witness
who
we
have
positive
reason
to
think
is
going
to
testify
on
the
day
of
the
opening
speech
and
he
changes
his
mind
the
next
day
which
is
a
not
infrequent
occurrence.
(voice
overlap)
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arlen
specter
your
honor,
this
is
a
written
piece
of
paper
in
his
hand
that
he
refers
to
in
terms
of
what
a
witness
is
going
to
testify
to
who
was
called.
and
it
occupies
--
mr.
arlen
specter
no,
your
honor.
mr.
arlen
specter
you
cannot
put
the
confession
in;
you'd
have
to
put
the
witness
on
the
stand.
mr.
arlen
specter
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
that
is
what
was
done
here
and
the
best
indication
that
that
is
not
what
was
done
here
is
what
the
trial
court
said
on
the
motion
for
a
mistrial
immediately
afterward
where
contemporaneously
witness
in
event.
now,
the
trial
judge
said
that
there
was
not
a
reference
to
the
written
statement.
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
at
the
very
most
what
was
done
here
was
that
this
piece
of
paper
was
held
in
the
hands
of
the
district
attorney
just
as
he
would
hold
his
own
sheet
of
notes,
and
that
it
is
all
written
here
as
to
what
he
said
and
he
did
not
make
any
reference
to
this
being
a
statement
word
by
word
as
to
what
this
man
had
said
certainly
no
reference
at
all
to
the
issue
of
a
confession.
i
think
the
strongest
indication
that
this
item
was
not
of
real
consequence
in
this
trial
is
the
absence
of
a
request
by
the
defense
for
a
cautionary
instruction.
a
cautionary
instruction
of
course
may
serve
to
remind
the
jury
as
to
what
has
occurred
and
a
cautionary
instruction
may
not
be
observable
by
a
jury.
but
i
think
it
is
a
fair
inference
from
this
record
that
there
was
a
calculated
decision
made
and
i
think
perhaps
a
wise
man
from
a
trial
point
of
view
by
the
defense
attorney
that
there
would
be
no
request
for
a
cautionary
instruction
because
this
portion
of
the
trial
was
so
minimal
that
the
defendant
was
better
off
having
it
not
referred
to,
than
he
was
getting
an
instruction
that
the
jury
should
disregard
this
kind
of
evidence
as
was
done
for
example
united
states
versus
namet.
so,
that
i
think
that
really
puts
in
prospective
the
question
here
as
to
the
factor
that
it
was
not
of
really
substantial
importance
in
the
course
of
this
trial.
mr.
arlen
specter
none,
absolutely
none.
mr.
arlen
specter
by
neither
side
and
the
court
gave
a
general
charge
that
statements
of
counsel
were
not
to
be
regard
of
this
evidence
from
hornbook
procedures
so
that
that
was
present
and
perhaps
more
importantly
mr.
rook's
whole
tender
of
his
opening
made
it
plain
that
he
was
making
representation
as
to
what
he
intended
to
prove.
i
would
like,
if
i
may
to
deal
very
briefly
with
the
question
of
search
and
seizure
before
coming
to
the
perhaps
more
substantial
consideration
on
the
escobedo
argument.
i
think
that
the
facts
in
this
case
show
rather
emphatically
that
the
police
officers
were
justified
and
going
through
this
duffel
bag
where
they
had
no
indication
about
it.
in
fact,
belong
to
mr.
frazier,
the
defendant
in
this
case
now
that
the
duffel
bag
is
something
of
limited
size
not
knowing
which
compartment,
whose
clothes
were
in
and
that
they
then
came
upon
these
items
of
clothing
which
had
in
fact
been
worn
by
the
defendant,
mr.
frazier
blood
spots
and
stains
of
clothing.
and
under
the
decision
of
harris
versus
united
states
last
year
by
this
court,
coming
upon
objects
falling
in
the
plain
view
of
an
officer,
there
certainly
was
a
right
to
take
those
items
and
to
use
them
in
the
course
of
the
trial.
the
duffel
bag
--
they
searched
the
duffel
bag
and
then
consented
to
by
both
mr.
rawls
and
by
mr.
rawls'
mother,
the
aunt
of
this
defendant,
and
i
think
it
was
well
within
the
ambit
of
permissibility
on
search
and
seizure.
the
question
on
the
statement
presents
some
greater
difficulty
but
i
would
submit
to
your
honors
first
of
all
that
the
facts
of
this
situation
are
well
within
the
ambit
of
permissibility
under
the
escobedo
decision.
there,
was
the
single
statement
by
this
defendant
mr.
frazier
that
he
was
about
to
get
himself
into
more
trouble
but
he
had
been
advised
earlier
in
the
course
of
the
questioning
that
he
could
have
an
attorney
if
he
want
an
attorney
why
you
can
have
an
attorney
and
the
police
further
said,
“what
you
say
here
could
be
used
against
you
in
the
trial,
do
you
understand
that?”
and
there
was
an
affirmative
answer,
the
answer
yes.
i
think
that
the
case
is
put
in
real
perspective
by
the
argument
of
petitioner's
counsel
when
he
comes
to
this
question
of,
“was
the
will
of
the
defendant,
mr.
frazier
here
overborne
by
aggressive
interrogation?”
and
i
would
submit
to
your
honors
that
this
is
a
classical
case
to
show
from
a
tape
recording
which
was
made
at
the
time
of
this
interrogation
which
is
reprinted
in
full
that
there
was
an
abundance
of
fairness
and
there
was
an
abundance
of
propriety
by
these
police
officers
in
the
course
of
their
questioning
of
this
defendant.
the
arrest
in
this
case,
he
was
taken
into
custody
at
4:15,
he
arrived
at
the
detective
headquarters
at
4:50
and
he
was
questioned
from
5:05
to
5:10,
and
he
ended
shortly
after
6:00
so
there
was
approximately
one
hour
of
questioning
in
this
case.
i
would
submit
to
your
honors
that
if
the
court
concludes
that
the
statement
of
the
defendant,
frazier
is
not
within
the
purview
of
the
escobedo
decision
that
the
court
reversed
escobedo
and
adopt
in
its
place
the
standards
which
are
set
forth
in
the
crime
control
act
adopted
by
congress
last
june.
i
would
submit
to
your
honors
that
this
really
puts
into
focus
the
test
which
has
been
suggested
here
by
counsel
for
petitioner
as
to
whether
the
confession
was
voluntary
in
its
entirely.
the
federal
crime
control
act
is
now
the
law
of
the
land
presumptively
constitutional
and
certainly
a
more
stringent
standard
should
not
be
applied
to
the
states
than
that
which
is
applied
to
the
federal
government.
the
crime
control
act
has
been
passed
after
an
exhaustive
survey
made
by
the
legislative
branch
of
government
taking
into
account
many,
many
factors
some
of
which
have
been
provided
a
very
sound
statistical
basis
for
concluding
--
mr.
arlen
specter
no,
your
honor.
it
was
not
there
and
i
think
it
could
not
have
been
as
a
matter
of
timeliness.
i
think
that
this
argument
is
one
which
could've
arisen
only
in
the
immediate
prior
subsequent
to
the
passage
of
the
crime
control
act
of
1968
which
is
a
--
mr.
arlen
specter
no
your
honor,
it
is
not
briefed.
mr.
arlen
specter
yes
your
honor.
mr.
arlen
specter
the
statistical
base
to
which
i
was
referring
has
provided
a
very
strong
basis
for
a
conclusion
by
the
congress
that
there
have
been
substantial
reductions
in
the
number
of
a
confessions
and
statements
post
miranda
and
in
the
balancing
process
which
is
the
essential
ingredient
on
determining
constitutionality,
i
would
suggest
that
that
determination
should
be
accorded
great
weight.
mr.
arlen
specter
yes
sir,
it's
an
argument
overrule
escobedo
mr.
justice
brennan
and
which
would
necessarily
involved
an
overruling
of
miranda
because
the
escobedo
rules
are
less
stringent
on
law
enforcement
than
miranda.
but
we
are
faced
with
here
is
the
escobedo
rule
as
opposed
to
the
miranda
rule.
the
--
mr.
arlen
specter
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
i'm
authorized
to
represents
the
state
of
oregon.
mr.
arlen
specter
that's
correct.
mr.
arlen
specter
yes,
your
honor.
i
am
authorized
to
speak
for
the
state
of
oregon.
i
have
conferred
with
mr.
rook
on
this
point.
mr.
arlen
specter
yes
your
honor,
i
have
discussed
that
aspect
with
him.
mr.
arlen
specter
with
mr.
rook,
the
attorney
who
tried
the
case
and
the
district
attorney
of
clackamas
county,
oregon,
yes
sir
i
have.
i
would
suggest
that
under
the
standards
which
have
been
suggested
by
this
court
in
terms
of
alternative
procedures
to
guarantee
fairness
and
to
guarantee
voluntariness,
now
this
is
a
classical
case
supported
by
a
tape
recording
not
which
is
used
for
a
latter
formal
portion
of
a
statement
but
it's
a
tape
recording
embodying
the
entire
occurrence
between
the
defendant
and
the
interrogating
officers
that
this
does
comport
with
a
due
process
of
law
and
it's
an
ample
standard
for
judging
the
admissibility
of
this
confession.
mr.
arlen
specter
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
may
it
please
the
court.
taking
up
first
the
initial
argument
advanced
by
the
petitioner
with
respect
to
the
statements
by
the
district
attorney
in
the
opening
speech.
i
think
that
the
record
makes
it
perfectly
plain
that
this
item
is
even
less
than
what
has
been
characterized
by
this
court
to
be
a
minor
lapse
in
the
course
of
a
very
extensive
criminal
trial.
the
statement
made
by
the
district
attorney
at
the
outset,
amount
of
the
sum
two
pages
in
the
record
and
five
lines.
the
portion
of
the
transcript
where
the
co-indictee
rawls
was
called
to
the
stand
--
mr.
arlen
specter
i'm
representing
the
respondent
that
i've
been
asked
to
do
so
mr.
justice
douglas.
the
national
district
attorney's
association
asked
if
i
would
represent
the
respondent
here.
mr.
arlen
specter
yes,
sir.
mr.
arlen
specter
no,
mr.
chief
justice
warren.
i
speak
that
is
how
i
came
to
be
in
the
case
but
i
am
here
at
the
request
of
the
state
of
oregon,
to
represent
the
state
of
oregon
and
i
did
not
speak
for
the
national
--
mr.
arlen
specter
the
request
was
made
up
by
a
roger
rook,
the
district
attorney
of
clackamas
county
who's
in
the
courtroom
today.
mr.
arlen
specter
it
is
my
understanding
that
it
is
the
responsibility
of
mr.
rook
to
represent
himself
here,
represent
clackamas
county
in
the
state
of
oregon
and
he
has
--
mr.
arlen
specter
i
think
i
have
best
turn
to
mr.
rook
to
get
confirmation
of
it.
mr.
arlen
specter
well,
mr.
chief
justice
warren
i
am
thoroughly
familiar
with
all
of
the
matters
which
are
raised
in
this
case.
i
think
both
as
to
the
federal
principles
amnesty
oregon
principles
and
i
have
consulted
with
mr.
rook
about
the
oregon
principles
and
his
availability
here
is
certainly
would
enable
me
to
respond
to
any
question
which
might
arise
as
to
the
oregon
principles.
i
have
advised
the
clerk
of
my
position
mr.
chief
justice
warren
and
made
it
plaint
that
i
was
coming
in
as
a
counsel
in
the
case,
not
being
an
oregon
attorney,
being
a
philadelphia
pennsylvania
attorney.
so
that
i
made
every
effort
to
make
plain
my
position
here
sir.
mr.
arlen
specter
correct
your
honor,
i'm
here
representing
the
respondent
only,
yes
sir.
mr.
arlen
specter
the
point
that
i
think
is
most
important
on
the
first
argument
of
the
petitioner
is
that
the
entire
sequence
of
events
concerning
the
opening
statement
made
by
mr.
rook
and
the
amount
of
time
that
the
co-indictee
was
on
the
stand
involved
a
very
small
portion
of
this
extensive
trial.
measured
by
the
transcript
itself,
the
opening
statement
amounted
to
two
pages
and
five
lines
and
the
time
when
rawls
was
on
the
stand
amounted
to
somewhat
less
than
three
pages.
the
total
of
some
five
pages
on
a
transcript
which
runs
more
than
1,000
pages.
now
this
item
accounted
for
no
more
than
one
half
of
1%
of
this
entire
trial.
the
questions
which
were
asked
of
mr.
rawls
when
he
took
the
stand
amounted
to
only
two
in
number
and
neither
of
which
was
incriminating.
substantially
less
than
that
which
was
asked
of
the
witnesses
in
namet
versus
the
united
states
when
there
were
four
and
where
those
questions
did
go
to
incriminating
items.
the
reference
made
by
mr.
rook
in
his
opening
speech
did
not
involve
any
direct
reference
to
a
confession
at
all.
there
was
a
reference
to
a
statement
and
there
was
not
even
a
clear
reference
to
a
written
statement
and
the
matter
was
raised
immediately
after
the
opening
statement
on
the
defendant's
motion
for
a
mistrial
and
as
it
appears
on
page
48
of
the
printed
transcript.
the
court
noted,
“it
wasn't
my
observation
that
the
district
attorney
was
reading
from
any
statement,
i
don't
know
were
you
mr.
rook?”
and
mr.
rook
responded,
“i
was
not,
i
was
referring
to
it.”
mr.
arlen
specter
yes
your
honor,
he
did
have
it
in
his
hand.
as
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
he
had
many
papers
in
his
hands
as
he
was
making
his
opening
statement
but
he
never
referred
to
it
as
a
confession
and
he
--
mr.
arlen
specter
he
had
in
his
hands
--
mr.
arlen
specter
no,
no,
so
that
he
could
be
accurate
in
terms
of
what
he
was
saying.
in
the
course
of
his
opening
statement,
he
is
very
careful
in
quite
a
number
of
places
to
be
a
circumspect
in
the
positiveness
with
which
he
makes
representations
and
i
think
that
point
is
a
very
significant
one
in
terms
of
the
quality
of
that
opening
statement
where
he
does
not
speak
of
evidence
or
speak
of
facts
but
speaks
of
what
a
prosecutor
intends
to
prove
and
i
think
mr.
rook
makes
that
very
plain
throughout
the
entirety
of
his
opening
statement.
and
i
if
i
could
cite
just
a
few
examples
of
that
at
page
30
he
says,
“i
haven't
personally
talked
with
the
witnesses
that
the
state
has
and
i
don't
know
what
it
looks
like.”
and
on
page
31
he
says,
“i
think
our
testimony
will
be.”
and
on
page
33
he
says,
“i
think
that
the
evidence
will
show.”
on
page
35
he
says,
“i
don't
recall
what
it
is”
and
a
little
further
down
he
points
out,
“if
my
memory
serves
me
right
is
that
throughout
the
entire
presentation
of
mr.
rook,
he
is
doing
what
any
lawyer
does
in
an
opening
statement.
he
is
outlining
what
he
intends
to
prove
which
is
something
very
different
from
having
a
witness
on
the
stand
as
there
was
a
witness
on
the
stand
in
douglas
where
the
prosecutor
goes
over
a
statement.”
and
after
a
plea
and
says,
“now
isn't
this
what
you
said
to
which
the
witness
consistently
responds
with
a
plea
of
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment
where
this
is
enormously
different
from
what
happened
in
bruton
where
there
is
a
co-defendant
in
the
course
of
robbery
case
who
testifies
and
there
is
a
cautionary
instruction.”
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
that
in
the
context
of
the
opening,
there
were
two
other
matters
deemed
by
the
defense
lawyer
to
be
of
substantial
importance
where
as
the
comments
which
mr.
rook
made
about
the
testimony
that
he
intended
to
produce
from
mr.
rawls
was
not
objected
to
at
all
in
the
course
of
that
opening
statement.
although
it
was
one
of
the
grounds
for
a
mistrial
advanced
by
defense
counsel
immediately
after
the
opening
statement
was
concluded
so
i'm
not
saying
that
there
was
no
timely
objection
made.
i'm
merely
putting
it
in
the
context
of
the
opening
statement
where
there
was
an
interruption
and
an
objection
by
defense
counsel
on
the
question
of
mr.
rook's
intention
to
use
the
statement
of
the
defendant
mr.
frazier
and
there
was
an
eruption
and
objection
by
defense
counsel
on
the
reference
to
the
items
of
clothing
which
had
been
the
subject
of
search
and
seizure.
but
when
it
came
to
this
question
about
mr.
rook's
reference
to
what
he
intended
to
produce
through
the
testimony
of
the
co-defendant.
there
was
at
that
point
no
objection
at
all.
mr.
arlen
specter
yes,
sir.
mr.
arlen
specter
the
basis
for
the
motion
at
that
time
mr.
justice
harlan
was
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
mr.
rook
had
reason
to
know
that
the
witness
mr.
rawls
would
not
taken
stand
and
therefore
or
would
plead
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
therefore
it
would
not
be
before
the
jury.
and
this
matter
was
inquired
into
fully
and
appears
in
terms
of
mr.
rook's
reply
at
page
82
for
the
transcript
and
mr.
rook
made
reference
to
three
specific
reasons
why
he
believe
that
mr.
rawls
was
going
to
testify.
and
those
three
reasons
were,
number
one,
that
lieutenant
thomas
of
the
sheriff's
office
reported
to
me
this
is
his
testimony
“that
he
felt
sure
that
mr.
rawls
was
going
to
testify.
next,
he
receives
statement
from
mr.
ore
of
the
probation
office
that
mr.
rawls
was
going
to
testify
and
did
not
want
to
take
the
fifth.
and
third,
that
rawls'
two
brothers
and
or
mother
--
i
am
not
sure
of
that;
i'm
reading
from
the
record
here
at
least
two
of
them
or
three
of
them
had
talked
to
him
and
advised
me
that
although
counsel
advised
him
not
to
testify,
he
thought
he
wanted
to
testify
and
he
was
going
to
testify.
and
mr.
rook,
on
the
next
page
says
i'm
talking
about
the
information
i
had
in
my
head
at
the
time
that
these
events
occurred
and
it
is
of
course
not
of
unusual
procedure
for
a
defense
counsel
thinking
based
on
information
which
he
may
have
had
perhaps
in
an
earlier
date
of
that
the
plea
of
privilege
would
be
entered
to
attempt
to
dissuade
a
prosecutor
from
going
ahead
with
that
line
of
evidence.
mr.
arlen
specter
these
references
mr.
justice
harlan
took
place
immediately
after
mr.
rawls
was
placed
on
the
stand
so
that
there
was
a
detailing
in
terms
of
what
mr.
rook
which
i
would
think
the
more
germane
time
when
he
actually
put
him
on
the
stand
and
that
is
what
he
had
as
he
put
it
in
his
head
at
that
time.
i
think
that
if
the
petitioner's
point
is
adopted
on
this
line
that
there
would
be
a
very
substantial
undercutting
of
the
prosecutor's
right
to
make
an
opening
speech
and
i
think
this
case
illustrates
it
very
well
because
there
were
objections
made
to
three
points;
two
of
them
actually
during
the
course
of
the
speech
and
the
third
one
afterwards.
on
three
of
the
essential
points
of
evidence
which
the
prosecutor
was
going
to
put
forward;
first,
the
defendant's
statement
itself,
secondly,
the
expected
testimony
of
a
co-defendant
and
third,
an
outline
of
the
evidence
which
have
been
subject
to
search
and
seizure.
now,
anyone
of
these
points
might
have
been
rendered
inadmissible
although
the
search
and
seizure
point
had
been
cleared
for
a
pretrial
motion.
but
if
we
would
to
take
the
position
of
defense
counsel
at
the
trial
that
a
prosecutor
could
not
go
into
these
items.
it
is
claimed
from
this
case
that
the
major
substance
of
what
the
prosecutor
was
going
to
talk
about
to
the
jury
would
be
stricken
from
the
scope
of
his
opening
speech.
and
i
think
that
the
right
in
the
prosecutor
to
make
the
opening
outline
is
a
very
crucial
one
when
the
prosecution
has
the
burden
of
proof
when
the
facts
very
frequently
or
disjointed
when
there
has
to
be
some
outline
to
be
followed
to
give
the
jury
some
thread
as
to
what
is
coming
and
how
they
fit
into
the
overall
picture
disconnected
bits
of
evidence.
and
if
the
defense
position
were
to
be
upheld
here
and
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
think
it
is
perfectly
plain
that
--
mr.
arlen
specter
well,
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
i
think
because
there
has
to
be
a
thread
is
to
what
happened
when
the
three
men
were
together,
mr.
frazier,
mr.
rawls
and
mr.
marleau
that
is
crucial
time
in
this
case.
i
would
want
to
make
one
thing
perfectly
plain
and
that
is
that
mr.
rook
never
referred
to
a
confession
of
call
by
mr.
rawls.
never
said
it
was
a
confession.
he
said,
“rawls
have
made
the
statement”
and
i
think
it
is
a
fair
inference,
mr.
justice
marshall
points
out
that
he
had
a
written
statement
to
that
effect
but
he
never
said
it
was
a
confession.
and
he
then
proceeded
to
outline
what
happened
when
those
three
men
were
together.
he
faced
precisely
that
problem
when
he
was
to
make
references
to
the
statement
of
the
defendant
mr.
frazier.
there
again,
he
had
identical
problems,
how
much
detail
does
a
prosecutor
go
into
in
outlining
what
he
intends
to
prove
through
that
witness.
and
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
you
really
have
to
at
that
point
tell
them
what
is
going
to
transpire
in
the
case
if
they're
going
to
be
able
to
piece
together
all
of
the
detail
facts
which
are
present.
mr.
arlen
specter
i'm
saying
yes.
the
testimony
is
important
had
it
got
in
but
our
--
mr.
arlen
specter
yes
sir.
i'm
arguing
that
it
is
one
of
three
crucial
parts
of
the
prosecutor's
case
but
the
way
it
unfolded
before
this
jury
it
was
not
put
before
this
jury
to
any
significant
extent.
it
was
put
to
the
jury
in
a
very,
very
abbreviated
form
in
five
pages
out
of
a
1000-page
record.
and
that
is
why
i
say
even
though
this
point
was
crucial
important
to
the
prosecution,
it
was
not
put
before
the
jury
in
any
detail
at
all
and
the
record
will
show
that
out
of
an
opening
speech
of
some
28
pages
in
the
transcript
this
occupied
about
one-seventh.
mr.
arlen
specter
well,
--
mr.
arlen
specter
yes,
sir.
i
submit
that
it
would.
i
respectfully
submit
that
it
would
because
how
is
a
prosecutor
to
know
when
he
is
making
his
opening
speech,
what
evidence
is
not
going
to
be
available
to
him
that
afternoon
or
the
next
day
or
a
week
later.
there
may
be
a
death
of
a
witness,
there
may
be
a
witness
who
fleas
the
jurisdiction,
there
may
be
--
mr.
arlen
specter
no
sir.
no,
it
is
not
but
this
is
the
import
i
submit
to
your
honor
as
to
what
would
happen
here
or
a
witness
who
we
have
positive
reason
to
think
is
going
to
testify
on
the
day
of
the
opening
speech
and
he
changes
his
mind
the
next
day
which
is
a
not
infrequent
occurrence.
(voice
overlap)
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arlen
specter
your
honor,
this
is
a
written
piece
of
paper
in
his
hand
that
he
refers
to
in
terms
of
what
a
witness
is
going
to
testify
to
who
was
called.
and
it
occupies
--
mr.
arlen
specter
no,
your
honor.
mr.
arlen
specter
you
cannot
put
the
confession
in;
you'd
have
to
put
the
witness
on
the
stand.
mr.
arlen
specter
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
that
is
what
was
done
here
and
the
best
indication
that
that
is
not
what
was
done
here
is
what
the
trial
court
said
on
the
motion
for
a
mistrial
immediately
afterward
where
contemporaneously
witness
in
event.
now,
the
trial
judge
said
that
there
was
not
a
reference
to
the
written
statement.
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
at
the
very
most
what
was
done
here
was
that
this
piece
of
paper
was
held
in
the
hands
of
the
district
attorney
just
as
he
would
hold
his
own
sheet
of
notes,
and
that
it
is
all
written
here
as
to
what
he
said
and
he
did
not
make
any
reference
to
this
being
a
statement
word
by
word
as
to
what
this
man
had
said
certainly
no
reference
at
all
to
the
issue
of
a
confession.
i
think
the
strongest
indication
that
this
item
was
not
of
real
consequence
in
this
trial
is
the
absence
of
a
request
by
the
defense
for
a
cautionary
instruction.
a
cautionary
instruction
of
course
may
serve
to
remind
the
jury
as
to
what
has
occurred
and
a
cautionary
instruction
may
not
be
observable
by
a
jury.
but
i
think
it
is
a
fair
inference
from
this
record
that
there
was
a
calculated
decision
made
and
i
think
perhaps
a
wise
man
from
a
trial
point
of
view
by
the
defense
attorney
that
there
would
be
no
request
for
a
cautionary
instruction
because
this
portion
of
the
trial
was
so
minimal
that
the
defendant
was
better
off
having
it
not
referred
to,
than
he
was
getting
an
instruction
that
the
jury
should
disregard
this
kind
of
evidence
as
was
done
for
example
united
states
versus
namet.
so,
that
i
think
that
really
puts
in
prospective
the
question
here
as
to
the
factor
that
it
was
not
of
really
substantial
importance
in
the
course
of
this
trial.
mr.
arlen
specter
none,
absolutely
none.
mr.
arlen
specter
by
neither
side
and
the
court
gave
a
general
charge
that
statements
of
counsel
were
not
to
be
regard
of
this
evidence
from
hornbook
procedures
so
that
that
was
present
and
perhaps
more
importantly
mr.
rook's
whole
tender
of
his
opening
made
it
plain
that
he
was
making
representation
as
to
what
he
intended
to
prove.
i
would
like,
if
i
may
to
deal
very
briefly
with
the
question
of
search
and
seizure
before
coming
to
the
perhaps
more
substantial
consideration
on
the
escobedo
argument.
i
think
that
the
facts
in
this
case
show
rather
emphatically
that
the
police
officers
were
justified
and
going
through
this
duffel
bag
where
they
had
no
indication
about
it.
in
fact,
belong
to
mr.
frazier,
the
defendant
in
this
case
now
that
the
duffel
bag
is
something
of
limited
size
not
knowing
which
compartment,
whose
clothes
were
in
and
that
they
then
came
upon
these
items
of
clothing
which
had
in
fact
been
worn
by
the
defendant,
mr.
frazier
blood
spots
and
stains
of
clothing.
and
under
the
decision
of
harris
versus
united
states
last
year
by
this
court,
coming
upon
objects
falling
in
the
plain
view
of
an
officer,
there
certainly
was
a
right
to
take
those
items
and
to
use
them
in
the
course
of
the
trial.
the
duffel
bag
--
they
searched
the
duffel
bag
and
then
consented
to
by
both
mr.
rawls
and
by
mr.
rawls'
mother,
the
aunt
of
this
defendant,
and
i
think
it
was
well
within
the
ambit
of
permissibility
on
search
and
seizure.
the
question
on
the
statement
presents
some
greater
difficulty
but
i
would
submit
to
your
honors
first
of
all
that
the
facts
of
this
situation
are
well
within
the
ambit
of
permissibility
under
the
escobedo
decision.
there,
was
the
single
statement
by
this
defendant
mr.
frazier
that
he
was
about
to
get
himself
into
more
trouble
but
he
had
been
advised
earlier
in
the
course
of
the
questioning
that
he
could
have
an
attorney
if
he
want
an
attorney
why
you
can
have
an
attorney
and
the
police
further
said,
“what
you
say
here
could
be
used
against
you
in
the
trial,
do
you
understand
that?”
and
there
was
an
affirmative
answer,
the
answer
yes.
i
think
that
the
case
is
put
in
real
perspective
by
the
argument
of
petitioner's
counsel
when
he
comes
to
this
question
of,
“was
the
will
of
the
defendant,
mr.
frazier
here
overborne
by
aggressive
interrogation?”
and
i
would
submit
to
your
honors
that
this
is
a
classical
case
to
show
from
a
tape
recording
which
was
made
at
the
time
of
this
interrogation
which
is
reprinted
in
full
that
there
was
an
abundance
of
fairness
and
there
was
an
abundance
of
propriety
by
these
police
officers
in
the
course
of
their
questioning
of
this
defendant.
the
arrest
in
this
case,
he
was
taken
into
custody
at
4:15,
he
arrived
at
the
detective
headquarters
at
4:50
and
he
was
questioned
from
5:05
to
5:10,
and
he
ended
shortly
after
6:00
so
there
was
approximately
one
hour
of
questioning
in
this
case.
i
would
submit
to
your
honors
that
if
the
court
concludes
that
the
statement
of
the
defendant,
frazier
is
not
within
the
purview
of
the
escobedo
decision
that
the
court
reversed
escobedo
and
adopt
in
its
place
the
standards
which
are
set
forth
in
the
crime
control
act
adopted
by
congress
last
june.
i
would
submit
to
your
honors
that
this
really
puts
into
focus
the
test
which
has
been
suggested
here
by
counsel
for
petitioner
as
to
whether
the
confession
was
voluntary
in
its
entirely.
the
federal
crime
control
act
is
now
the
law
of
the
land
presumptively
constitutional
and
certainly
a
more
stringent
standard
should
not
be
applied
to
the
states
than
that
which
is
applied
to
the
federal
government.
the
crime
control
act
has
been
passed
after
an
exhaustive
survey
made
by
the
legislative
branch
of
government
taking
into
account
many,
many
factors
some
of
which
have
been
provided
a
very
sound
statistical
basis
for
concluding
--
mr.
arlen
specter
no,
your
honor.
it
was
not
there
and
i
think
it
could
not
have
been
as
a
matter
of
timeliness.
i
think
that
this
argument
is
one
which
could've
arisen
only
in
the
immediate
prior
subsequent
to
the
passage
of
the
crime
control
act
of
1968
which
is
a
--
mr.
arlen
specter
no
your
honor,
it
is
not
briefed.
mr.
arlen
specter
yes
your
honor.
mr.
arlen
specter
the
statistical
base
to
which
i
was
referring
has
provided
a
very
strong
basis
for
a
conclusion
by
the
congress
that
there
have
been
substantial
reductions
in
the
number
of
a
confessions
and
statements
post
miranda
and
in
the
balancing
process
which
is
the
essential
ingredient
on
determining
constitutionality,
i
would
suggest
that
that
determination
should
be
accorded
great
weight.
mr.
arlen
specter
yes
sir,
it's
an
argument
overrule
escobedo
mr.
justice
brennan
and
which
would
necessarily
involved
an
overruling
of
miranda
because
the
escobedo
rules
are
less
stringent
on
law
enforcement
than
miranda.
but
we
are
faced
with
here
is
the
escobedo
rule
as
opposed
to
the
miranda
rule.
the
--
mr.
arlen
specter
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
i'm
authorized
to
represents
the
state
of
oregon.
mr.
arlen
specter
that's
correct.
mr.
arlen
specter
yes,
your
honor.
i
am
authorized
to
speak
for
the
state
of
oregon.
i
have
conferred
with
mr.
rook
on
this
point.
mr.
arlen
specter
yes
your
honor,
i
have
discussed
that
aspect
with
him.
mr.
arlen
specter
with
mr.
rook,
the
attorney
who
tried
the
case
and
the
district
attorney
of
clackamas
county,
oregon,
yes
sir
i
have.
i
would
suggest
that
under
the
standards
which
have
been
suggested
by
this
court
in
terms
of
alternative
procedures
to
guarantee
fairness
and
to
guarantee
voluntariness,
now
this
is
a
classical
case
supported
by
a
tape
recording
not
which
is
used
for
a
latter
formal
portion
of
a
statement
but
it's
a
tape
recording
embodying
the
entire
occurrence
between
the
defendant
and
the
interrogating
officers
that
this
does
comport
with
a
due
process
of
law
and
it's
an
ample
standard
for
judging
the
admissibility
of
this
confession.
