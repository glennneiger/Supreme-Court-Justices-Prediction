mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
i'm
howard
m.
feuerstein
of
portland,
oregon
representing
the
petitioner
martin
rene
frazier
who
was
a
prisoner
in
the
oregon
state
penitentiary
serving
a
25-year
sentence
for
second-degree
murder.
this
case
involves
frazier's
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
involves
three
distinct
issues.
the
first
issue
is
whether
frazier
was
denied
his
right
of
confrontation
when
the
prosecution
placed
before
the
jury
in
its
opening
statement
the
confession
of
a
co-indictee
who
had
later
invoked
his
fifth
amendment
right
not
to
testify.
the
second
issue
is
the
admissibility
of
frazier's
written
statement
and
whether
that
the
obtaining
of
that
statement
violated
escobedo
versus
illinois
or
in
the
alternative
that
statement
was
involuntarily
given.
and
finally,
case
involved
an
issue
of
validity
of
a
search
and
seizure
of
certain
clothing
of
frazier.
the
district
court
granted
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
on
the
right
of
confrontation
and
on
the
confession
issue
and
did
not
rule
on
the
search
and
seizure
issue.
the
warden
appealed
and
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
the
district
court
finding
against
frazier
on
all
three
issues.
this
court
granted
certiorari.
if
it
please
the
court
i'll
discuss
the
facts
as
they
pertain
to
each
issue
separately.
frazier
and
his
cousin
rawls
were
jointly
indicted
for
first-degree
murder
in
the
strangulation
slaying
of
one
russell
marleau.
frazier
entered
the
plea
of
not
guilty
and
at
the
time
of
frazier's
trial,
rawls
had
entered
the
plea
of
guilty
to
reduce
charge
of
second-degree
murder
and
was
in
jail
awaiting
sentence
on
that
charge.
at
frazier's
trial,
frazier's
defense
attorney
has
admitted
that
rawls,
frazier,
and
marleau
were
together
at
the
time
of
marleau's
death
and
that
an
altercation
occurred.
the
defense
however
asserted
that
it
was
rawls
who
strangled
marleau
and
that
frazier
had
no
part
in
the
strangulation.
the
prosecution
of
course
denied
this.
they
had
ample
evidence
placing
the
three
at
the
secluded
scene
of
the
crime.
they
of
course
had
no
direct
evidence
as
to
who
did
the
strangling
because
there
are
no
other
eyewitnesses.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
that
is
correct,
however,
that
was
not
the
cause
of
the
death.
the
prosecution
primarily
tried
to
impeach
frazier's
version
of
what
it
transpired.
the
day
in
which
frazier's
trial
was
to
start
prior
to
impaneling
a
jury.
the
attorneys
met
with
the
judge
in
chambers.
at
that
time,
frazier's
attorney
informed
the
district
attorney
that
he'd
heard
that
rawls
had
been
subpoenaed
and
that
he
just
talked
to
rawls'
attorney
and
been
informed
that
rawls
would
not
testify
if
called
to
the
stand.
we
know
that
prior
to
this
time
the
district
attorney
was
in
possession
of
conflicting
information
on
whether
or
not
rawls
is
to
testify.
a
jury
was
impaneled
in
the
next
day,
the
district
attorney
made
his
opening
statement,
in
the
course
of
the
opening
statement
he
said,
that
the
officers
had
talked
to
rawls
during
their
investigation
and
that
the
district
attorney
was
going
to
call
rawls
as
a
witness.
at
this
point,
holding
rawls
confession
in
his
hand,
the
district
attorney
proceeded
to
paraphrase
that
confession.
the
defense
moved
for
mistrial
after
the
opening
statement
which
was
denied.
later
the
district
attorney
called
rawls
to
the
stand.
rawls
appeared
with
his
attorney
and
refuse
to
testify.
defense
renewed
his
motion
for
mistrial
and
a
hearing
was
held
before
the
judge,
the
motion
was
denied.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
no,
it's
a
requirement
that
you
--
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
--
mention
in
the
opening
statement,
no
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
yes,
as
a
matter
(voice
overlap).
it
was
not
referred
to
as
a
confession.
if
you
read
the
opening
statement
which
is
in
the
appendix
on
pages
41
to
43,
they're
all
in
part,
you'll
find
that
for
instance
nearly
very
first
the
prosecutor
said,
“that
it
is
rawls'
version
that
such
and
such
occurred”
and
then
he
stopped
and
says,
“maybe
i'm
wrong.
i
will
look
here
to
see
as
to
whether
rawls
said
that
he
hit
him
first”
and
at
other
times
you
have
phrases
like
“rawls
said”
or
“it's
rawls
version.”
so
that
there
was
a
clear
inference,
one
that
the
officers
had
talked
to
rawls;
two,
that
rawls
had
given
his
version
to
the
officers;
and
three,
the
inference
is
inescapable
that
what
the
district
attorney
was
doing
was
setting
out
before
the
jury
what
rawls'
version
was
and
what
rawls
had
told
the
police.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
that
is
right,
in
fact,
the
defense
never
saw
the
written
confession
until
rawls
later
change
his
plead
of
not
guilty
and
was
introduced
in
rawls'
trial.
no
specific
instruction
was
requested
of
the
judge
and
the
judge
did
not
give
one
to
disregard
these
particular
comments
in
the
opening
statement.
the
judge
did
however
in
his
general
charge
to
the
jury
indicate
that
statements
of
counsel
are
not
evidenced.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
i
think
the
trial
lasted
approximately
a
week.
the
district
court
based
its
decision
on
this
court's
opinion
in
douglas
versus
alabama.
the
court
may
recall
in
that
case
the
prosecutor
by
means
of
leading
questions
placed
the
accomplice's
confession
before
the
jury
while
the
accomplice
is
on
the
stand
asserting
the
fifth
amendment.
the
ninth
circuit
on
the
warden
wished
to
distinguish
douglas
versus
alabama
and
the
later
case
of
bruton
versus
united
states.
on
the
ground
that
here
the
prosecutor
acted
in
good
faith
and
that
the
statement
was
not
unfairly
prejudicial
to
the
defendant.
we
submit,
however,
that
the
rule
under
douglas
and
bruton
is
that
where
the
prosecution
places
a
substance
under
accomplice's
confession
before
the
jury
and
the
defendant
is
denied
the
right
of
confrontation
if
that
is
not
subject
to
cross
examination.
we
submit
that
the
defendant
is
just
as
surely
denied
his
right
to
confront
and
cross-examine
rawls
whether
or
not
the
prosecution
acted
in
good
faith
or
in
bad
faith
or
was
merely
negligent
in
placing
this
before
the
jury.
perhaps
the
ninth
circuit
the
warden
had
confused
the
right
of
confrontation
which
is
a
fundamental
right
with
the
more
general
due
process
right
against
the
prosecutorial
misconduct.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
no,
your
honor
not
that
i
know
of.
as
far
as
i
know
it
has
never
been
--
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
as
far
as
i
know,
yes
your
honor.
the
warden
also
attempts
to
distinguish
the
douglas
case
from
the
present
case
by
saying
that
here
the
statement
was
made
in
the
opening
statement
and
was
in
the
form
of
expected
testimony,
whereas
i've
already
indicated
the
prosecutor
or
district
attorney
fairly
implied
that
rawls
had
made
a
statement,
that
rawls
had
said
these
things
so
that
he
clearly
raised
the
inference
of
past
statements
rather
than
future
statements.
certainly,
one
cannot
constitutionally
distinguish
the
remarks
of
counsel
who
made
examining
witnesses'
remarks
of
counsel
were
made
in
opening
statements.
the
right
of
confrontation
is
not
suspended
during
opening
statements.
the
warden
has
hinted
that
the
statement
was
not
prejudicial
but
we
would
point
out
that
rawls
was
the
only
other
eyewitness
to
the
crime
and
there
was
no
other
evidence
in
the
case
to
the
effect
that
frazier
strangled
marleau
and
this
was
the
key
issue
in
the
case.
nor
legally
under
chapman
versus
california,
can
one
assume
that
the
jury
forgot
or
ignored
what
the
prosecutor
said
in
his
opening
statement.
surely
when
rawls
took
the
stand
and
refused
to
testify
and
then
the
motion
for
mistrial
was
made,
the
jury
must
have
speculated
on
what
rawls
would
have
testified
and
what
was
said
in
the
opening
statement.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
i
would
say
there
was
probably
several
days.
the
prosecution
contends
that
holding
the
prosecution
accountable
what
it
says
in
its
opening
statement
would
have
an
adverse
effect
on
future
cases.
we
submit
that
this
is
not
true.
if
i
were
a
prosecutor
and
i
had
a
case
in
which
i
wanted
to
use
a
witness
who
may
or
may
not
assert
his
right
not
to
testify
and
i
have
choice,
i
can
say
nothing
in
the
opening
statement
about
this
witnesses'
testimony
and
if
he
does
not
testify
then
no
harm
has
been
made.
on
the
other
hand,
if
he
does
testify
then
in
my
closing
argument
i
can
make
all
the
mileage
out
of
it
that
i
want.
there
may
be
cases
where
the
testimony
of
this
witness
is
so
critical
to
the
prosecution's
case
and
the
prosecution
may
be
so
sure
that
this
witness
will
testify
that
the
prosecution
will
take
a
calculated
risk
or
bring
it
out
in
the
opening
statement
knowing
full
well
that
there
may
be
a
mistrial
if
the
witness
does
not
testify.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
i
would
say
that
the
effect
on
the
defendant
is
just
the
same
even
though
the
prosecutor
had
the
best
faith
in
the
world,
the
best
reason
in
the
world
that
this
man
would
testify
because
the
fact
is
that
the
right
of
confrontation
is
basic
to
our
arbitrary
system.
you
put
in
effect
that
deposition
or
a
written
statement
of
a
witness
which
is
not
subject
to
cross-examination
and
if
it
goes
before
the
jury,
no
amount
of
good
faith
will
cure
that.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
your
honor,
more
accurately
i
think
i
would
say
that
rather
than
excepting,
i
would
say
that
does
not
matter.
i
would
point
out
however,
if
the
court
should
find
that
good
faith
is
critical
then
i
would
say
that
good
faith
and
bad
faith
are
defined
variously
for
different
purposes
in
the
law,
and
i
would
say
surely
when
the
prosecutor
goes
forth
blindly
with
conflicting
information
and
does
not
confirm
or
deny
that
information
that
that
is
probably
bad
faith.
turning
to
the
admissibility
of
frazier's
concession,
at
the
time
frazier
was
taken
into
custody
--
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
what
occurred
was
that
after
rawls
refused
to
testify,
hearing
was
held
and
the
prosecutor
then
told
the
judge
under
oath
what
his
information
was
and
as
i
read
that
testimony
and
as
i
understand
it,
prior
to
the
trial,
the
prosecutor
talked
with
rawls'
attorney
or
at
least
the
prosecutor's
deputy.
rawls'
attorney
told
the
deputy
they
talked
rawls,
rawls
would
not
testify.
however,
sometime
prior
to
the
trial,
i
think
a
probation
officer
and
perhaps
a
relative
of
rawls
and
maybe
some
other
people
had
said
that
they
thought
that
rawls
would
testify
any
way.
so
in
effect
that
the
prosecutor
had
conflicting
information
when
it
came
time
for
the
trial.
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
i
do
not
believe
the
prosecutor
indicated
that
he
rechecked
on
this
information
after
that
beginning
conference.
on
the
confession
issue,
it
is
clear
that
the
investigation
had
focused
on
frazier
and
rawls
at
the
time
frazier
was
taken
into
custody.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
tape
recording
of
the
entire
interrogation.
briefly,
it
indicates
that
there
was
preliminary
question
prior
to
any
warnings
have
been
given,
at
which
time
frazier
denied
having
been
with
marleau
that
night.
frazier
was
then
told
that
he
had
a
right
to
an
attorney
and
whatever
he
said
could
be
used
against
him,
then
the
questioning
came
more
accusatory
but
frazier
still
denied
being
with
marleau.
at
that
point
the
interrogator
falsely
told
frazier
that
rawls
was
in
custody
and
that
rawls
did
tell
everything.
in
fact,
rawls
was
still
free
and
the
police
did
not
yet
talk
to
rawls.
interrogator
used
various
standard
emotional
appeals
such
that
frazier
should
not
shoulder
that
entire
blame
himself
reference
to
frazier's
dead
mother.
he
was
on
emergency
leave
for
a
funeral
at
the
time.
and
after
that
frazier
admitted
having
been
with
marleau
the
night
of
the
crime
and
he
told
the
officers
what
happened
up
until
the
time
when
the
three
arrived
at
the
scene
of
the
crime,
then
frazier
stopped,
he
said
“i
think
i
had
better
get
a
lawyer
before
i
talk
anymore.
i'm
going
to
get
into
more
trouble
than
i
am
in
now.”
the
officer
replied,
“you
can't
be
in
any
more
trouble
than
you
are
in
now”
and
then
proceeded
with
the
interrogation.
frazier
then
gave
his
entire
version
of
what
transpired
although
he
is
still
denied
that
he
strangled
(voice
overlap).
pardon
me
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
that's
right,
this
was
after
escobedo.
the
trial
was
after
escobedo
but
before
miranda.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
that's
correct
your
honor.
frazier
then
made
a
complete
oral
statement
of
what
transpired
although
he
still
denied
that
he
strangled
marleau.
the
officer
offered
to
type
up
the
statement
that
frazier
would
sign
it
pointing
out
the
officer
would
testify
to
his
oral
admissions
any
way,
and
that
he
would
have
--
be
entitled
to
an
attorney
after
arraignment
which
would
be
made
that
night.
frazier
signed
a
written
statement
then
which
contained
the
standard
warnings
and
waiver
some
of
which
were
mimeograph
others
were
typed
on
the
statement.
this
case
--
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
you
see,
your
honor
this
is
case
is
somewhat
peculiar
in
that
at
the
time
of
this
interrogation,
the
oregon
supreme
court
had
decided
the
neely
case
at
which
interpreted
escobedo
in
the
broad
sense.
it
was
one
of
the
liberal
interpretations
of
escobedo.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
that's
correct
your
honor.
so
that
officers,
i
think
only
recently
had
instituted
this
procedure
of
the
standard
phrases.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
these
were
in
the
written
statement.
of
course
these
warnings
were
not
made
at
least
the
warning
of
right
to
remain
silent
was
not
made
prior
to
his
oral
admission.
we
submit
that
the
written
statement
was
clearly
a
fruit
of
the
oral
interrogation
since
the
officers
told
them
that
they
would
testify
to
the
oral
admissions
if
he
didn't
sign
the
written
statement
so
he
might
as
well
get
into
writing.
this
case
is
also
interesting
in
another
facet
and
that
we
not
only
have
a
tape
recording
of
the
entire
interrogation
but
we
have
a
thorough
psychiatric
study
of
the
accused.
frazier
had
an
insanity
defense.
there
are
four
psychiatrists
and
psychologists
and
neurosurgeon
who
testified
at
the
trial.
we
know
that
frazier
had
a
passive
personality
as
long
as
psychiatrist
said
he
was
like
a
leaf
blowing
in
the
wind
that
he
is
subject
to
discipline
and
direction,
that
he
has
intropunitive
personality
in
which
he
tends
to
turn
the
blame
within
or
to
blame
himself
for
whatever
occurs,
that
he
was
shy
and
immature
and
of
course
we
know
that
frazier
had
no
prior
experience
with
interrogations.
on
the
--
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
yes,
your
honor,
his
--
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
that
is
correct.
she'd
been
very
ill
throughout
his
life
and
had
been
on
medication
and
had
been
abusive
at
times,
yet
he
was
still
very
close
to
her.
he
had
no
other
family
other
than
rawls.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
he
was
20
years
old
at
the
time.
with
respect
to
escobedo,
the
state
contends
that
this
was
not
an
adequate
request
for
counsel.
we
submit
that
this
timid
but
plain
request
for
counsel
is
all
that
is
required.
there
is
nothing
in
escobedo
that
requires
an
aggressive
demand
for
council.
now
frazier
had
stopped
and
said
i
won't
say
anything
more
to
give
me
attorney,
he
doesn't
need
an
attorney
because
he
won't
confess.
he
asked
for
an
attorney
and
his
request
was
turned
aside
and
ignored.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
that
is
true.
then
the
question
arises
in
this.
in
the
context
of
this
case
--
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
what
are
the
facts
and
what
are
the
critical
facts.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
of
course
the
fact
this
man's
name
is
not
danny
escobedo
is
not
a
critical
fact
to
that
case.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
yes,
that
is
the
other
distinction
which
the
state
has
put
forward
that
in
escobedo,
the
accused
already
had
an
attorney
where
here
frazier
did
not
have
an
attorney
at
the
time
he
requested
one.
we
simply
submit
that
the
fact
that
frazier
did
not
have
the
foresight
or
opportunity
to
hire
a
lawyer
before
he
is
arrested
is
not
a
valid
ground
for
distinction.
as
to
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession,
of
course
this
court
must
review
all
the
circumstances
which
it
has
a
great
deal
of
information
with
which
to
do
that,
we
submit
that
under
all
these
circumstances
this
confession
was
a
product
of
a
will
overborne.
that
this
is
a
case
where
the
will
of
a
passive,
immature,
intropunitive
person
not
previously
interrogated
was
overborne
by
aggressive
interrogation
using
falsehoods,
denial
of
request
for
counsel,
emotional
appeals
and
lack
of
warnings.
there
is
one
other
question
on
--
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
yes,
it
was
submitted
to
the
jury.
that
raises
somewhat
of
a
problem
i
believe
to
the
states
next
contention
that's
frazier
waived
his
objections
to
the
mission
of
the
confession
because
he
took
the
stand
and
testified.
the
fact
is
that
the
states
agreed
to
put
--
placing
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession
for
the
juries
so
the
issue
was
still
on
the
case
when
frazier
testified.
in
any
case,
the
series
of
state
cases
which
are
cited
in
the
bruton's
brief
state
that
if
the
accused
takes
that
stand
and
repeats
substantially
the
confession.
the
substance
of
the
confession
that
he
has
waived
the
right
to
object
to
the
introduction
of
the
confession
in
certain
circumstances,
the
first
problem
is
that
even
under
those
cases
the
state
does
not
fit
within
the
test
because
the
test
requires
that
the
defendant
not
deny,
minimize
or
explain
a
way
the
statements
in
his
confessions.
but
in
at
least
two
respects,
frazier's
testimony
under
trial
differed
from
his
written
confession
and
the
prosecution
on
cross-examination
brought
this
out
and
then
attempted
to
impeach
frazier's
credibility.
and
his
credibility
was
one
of
the
key
issues
in
the
case.
moreover
as
the
ninth
circuit
in
gladden
versus
unsworth
and
that's
not
cited
in
the
briefs,
that's
396
f.2d
373
indicated
the
state
cases
relied
upon
by
the
warden
did
not
set
forth
a
federal
standard
of
waiver.
the
federal
standard
enforces
intelligent
relinquishment
of
a
known
right
and
we
can
find
no
indication
that
frazier
when
he
agreed
to
take
the
stand
being
faced
with
the
reference
to
rawls'
testimony
and
opening
statement
intended
to
waive
his
strong
objections
to
the
mission
of
the
written
statement.
certainly,
it
cannot
be
said
that
there
was
no
prejudice
in
the
admission
of
the
written
statement.
assuming
prejudice
is
relevant
at
all
under
chapman
and
other
cases
dealing
with
forced
confessions.
the
fact
that
the
frazier's
written
statement
was
used
to
impeach
his
testimony
and
the
fact
that
the
state
may
not
have
even
made
a
prima
facie
case
without
the
written
statement,
i
think
indicates
that
there
was
prejudice.
on
the
search
and
seizure
issue,
the
facts
are
relatively
simple.
frazier
and
rawls
shared
a
bedroom
in
the
home
of
rawls'
parents.
frazier
had
all
of
his
possession
in
his
military
bag,
flight
bag,
or
duffel
bag.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
i
believe
so
although
i
do
not
believe
that
they
were
close
in
contact
with
respects.
they
were
--
i
don't
know
if
they
got
along
very
well.
the
bag
had
three
separate
compartments,
two-side
zippered
compartments
and
a
centered
compartment.
apparently,
rawls
put
some
of
his
clothing
in
the
side
zippered
compartment
or
one
of
them.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
case
whether
frazier
consented
or
not.
there
is
no
evidence
one
way
or
the
other.
we
do
know
that
from
rawls'
expected
testimony,
the
opening
statement
that
rawls'
version
is
that
he
had
permission.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
well
no
because
i'm
willing
to
assume
for
purposes
of
argument
that
frazier
consented
to
the
placing
of
the
clothes
in
the
side
compartment.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
i
have
no
objection
to
that
assumption.
the
problem
is
that
when
the
police
arrested
rawls,
they
asked
him
for
the
clothes
they
wore
the
night
of
the
crime.
he
said
that
they
could
have
them,
that
they
were
in
a
blue
flight
bag
in
his
room.
the
police
went
up,
they
took
the
bag,
and
they
took
it
back
to
headquarters
and
searched
it.
the
state
contends
that
because
rawls
was
a
joint
user
of
the
bag,
he
had
the
power
to
consent
to
the
search
of
the
bag
and
the
police
had
the
power
to
seize
whatever
they
saw
in
the
course
of
the
search.
there's
one
difficulty
with
that
however
your
honors,
that
is,
that
rawls
was
a
joint
user
of
the
only
the
side
pocket
of
the
bag.
well
i
see
its
time
for
the
recess.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
on
the
search
of
seizure
issue,
our
contention
is
quite
simple
and
straightforward.
first,
rawls
was
a
joint
user
of
only
the
side
pocket
of
the
bag
and
therefore
only
had
the
power
to
consent
to
a
search
of
the
side
pocket.
the
mere
apparent
ownership
of
the
bag
as
a
whole
would
not
be
enough
under
stoner
versus
california.
it
is
true
that
the
police
could
seize
anything
that
came
into
view
while
searching
that
side
pocket
but
under
harris
versus
untied
states,
they
could
seize
only
what
came
into
view
when
they
ran
a
place
where
they
had
the
right
to
be
and
since
the
police
had
no
power
and
no
consent
to
be
in
the
center
pocket.
they
could
not
seize
what
came
into
view
in
the
center
of
the
pocket.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
the
transcript
indicates
that
the
bulk
of
frazier's
clothing
was
found
in
the
center
compartment.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
he
just
said
it's
in
a
blue
bag
in
my
room.
that
was
the
extent
of
it.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
yes,
i
think
that
he
consented
to
their
taking
his
clothes
out
of
the
side
pocket.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
no,
no.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
they
did
not
know
but
the
fact
that
they
did
not
know
did
not
give
them
power,
is
my
position
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
well
i
would
think
that
--
let
us
suppose
that
instead
of
a
bag
--
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
yes.
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
that's
right
because
the
doctrine
of
joint
user
or
joint
use
of
a
particular
(voice
overlap).
that's
right
and
that's
established.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
they
had
--
our
position
would
be
that
they
have
no
right
to
be
in
the
center
compartment,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
well
if
they
didn't
know,
of
course
they
could
have
always
asked
but
they
did
not
your
honor
and
--
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
because
and
only
because
of
consent
of
a
joint
user.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
rawls.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
well,
he
consented
to
their
having
his
clothes
and
that
they
could
have
his
clothes.
he
told
them
generally
where
it
was
and
i
would
take
that
probably
as
being
consent
to
there
going
in
and
going
wherever
necessary
to
take
his
clothes.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
well,
i
assume
that
they
would
not
have
any
way
of
knowing.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
it
is
--
it's
a
question
of
power.
once
they
leave
the
domain
of
which
they
had
the
right
to
be
and
their
only
right
was
because
of
consent
--
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
well,
an
analogy
situation
might
be
i
suppose
that
frazier
and
rawls
joined
or
occupied
a
room
and
rawls
merely
said
that
my
clothes
are
in
this
room,
you
can
go
get
them.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
and
that,
in
that
room
was
a
dresser
exclusively
owned
and
used
by
frazier
and
the
police
not
knowing
where
rawls
clothes
were
went
in
and
searched
the
dresser.
not
knowing,
i
would
say
that
under
those
circumstances
the
police
exceeded
their
authority
and
that
they
were
in
a
place
in
which
they
did
not
have
the
consent
to
be
and
which
rawls
did
not
have
the
power
to
give
them
consent
to
be.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
no,
it
is
question
of
scope
and
power
to
consent.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
that's
right.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
it
was
exclusively
frazier's,
that's
correct.
that
is
exclusively
used
by
frazier.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
that's
right
because
that
closet
is
jointly
occupied
and
used
by
the
two
and
therefore
either
one
of
them
had
the
power
to
consent.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
that's
correct,
in
plain
view.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
any
part
of
the
grip
that
was
jointly
used
by
frazier
and
rawls
because
therefore
either
one
of
them
has
consent
to
the
search
of
that
area.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
that's
right,
that's
why
i
would
say
the
side
pocket
was
exclusively
frazier's.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
merely
say
that
it
is
true
that
the
district
attorney
did
not
refer
to
this
as
confession.
in
fact,
it
was
really
an
exculpatory
statement
and
which
the
--
suppose
accomplice
placed
all
the
blame
on
frazier.
and
throughout
this
opening
statement
such
phrases
as
“this
is
rawls'
version.”
rawls
said
that,
“he
took
--
trying
to
rob
the
bank.”
he
said,
“we
took
all
the
clothes
off
after
we
got
home
and
put
them
into
the
travel
bag.”
it
was
perfectly
clear
to
anyone
hearing
the
opening
statement
that
rawls
had
made
a
statements
to
the
police
and
that
the
district
attorney
was
telling
the
jury
what
the
statement
was
and
there
was
no
way
in
the
world
which
the
defense
could
test
that
version
of
rawls
of
cross-examination
because
rawls
refused
to
testify.
the
same
would've
been
true
if
completely
unexpected
rawls
had
died
and
did
not
testify
at
all.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
it
was
played
to
the
judge
in
chambers
in
ruling
on
expression.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
the
tape
recording
itself
is
not
but
the
transcript
is.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
no,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
that's
correct.
everything
that
is
said
has
been
transcribed
and
it
is
in
the
appendix.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
i'm
not
sure
whether
the
--
i
think
the
tape
recording
was
may
have
been
in
evidence
solely
for
the
purpose
of
the
hearing
of
a
voluntariness
of
the
confession.
it
was
never
presented
to
the
jury
or
placed
before
the
jury.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
it
was
relied
on
by
both
the
state
and
the
defense
for
purposes
of
indicating
whether
the
confession
was
voluntary
and
whether
escobedo
and
the
state
--
neely
versus
state
have
been
complied
with.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
apparently,
he
did
and
this
was
indicated
to
him
that
what
was
on
the
tape
would
be
orally
placed
in
evidence
if
he
did
not
sign
the
written
statement.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
no,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
only
for
purposes
of
ruling
on
the
voluntariness
or
admissibility
of
the
written
statement.
it
was
not
placed
before
the
jury
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
thank
you.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
i'm
howard
m.
feuerstein
of
portland,
oregon
representing
the
petitioner
martin
rene
frazier
who
was
a
prisoner
in
the
oregon
state
penitentiary
serving
a
25-year
sentence
for
second-degree
murder.
this
case
involves
frazier's
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
involves
three
distinct
issues.
the
first
issue
is
whether
frazier
was
denied
his
right
of
confrontation
when
the
prosecution
placed
before
the
jury
in
its
opening
statement
the
confession
of
a
co-indictee
who
had
later
invoked
his
fifth
amendment
right
not
to
testify.
the
second
issue
is
the
admissibility
of
frazier's
written
statement
and
whether
that
the
obtaining
of
that
statement
violated
escobedo
versus
illinois
or
in
the
alternative
that
statement
was
involuntarily
given.
and
finally,
case
involved
an
issue
of
validity
of
a
search
and
seizure
of
certain
clothing
of
frazier.
the
district
court
granted
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
on
the
right
of
confrontation
and
on
the
confession
issue
and
did
not
rule
on
the
search
and
seizure
issue.
the
warden
appealed
and
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
the
district
court
finding
against
frazier
on
all
three
issues.
this
court
granted
certiorari.
if
it
please
the
court
i'll
discuss
the
facts
as
they
pertain
to
each
issue
separately.
frazier
and
his
cousin
rawls
were
jointly
indicted
for
first-degree
murder
in
the
strangulation
slaying
of
one
russell
marleau.
frazier
entered
the
plea
of
not
guilty
and
at
the
time
of
frazier's
trial,
rawls
had
entered
the
plea
of
guilty
to
reduce
charge
of
second-degree
murder
and
was
in
jail
awaiting
sentence
on
that
charge.
at
frazier's
trial,
frazier's
defense
attorney
has
admitted
that
rawls,
frazier,
and
marleau
were
together
at
the
time
of
marleau's
death
and
that
an
altercation
occurred.
the
defense
however
asserted
that
it
was
rawls
who
strangled
marleau
and
that
frazier
had
no
part
in
the
strangulation.
the
prosecution
of
course
denied
this.
they
had
ample
evidence
placing
the
three
at
the
secluded
scene
of
the
crime.
they
of
course
had
no
direct
evidence
as
to
who
did
the
strangling
because
there
are
no
other
eyewitnesses.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
that
is
correct,
however,
that
was
not
the
cause
of
the
death.
the
prosecution
primarily
tried
to
impeach
frazier's
version
of
what
it
transpired.
the
day
in
which
frazier's
trial
was
to
start
prior
to
impaneling
a
jury.
the
attorneys
met
with
the
judge
in
chambers.
at
that
time,
frazier's
attorney
informed
the
district
attorney
that
he'd
heard
that
rawls
had
been
subpoenaed
and
that
he
just
talked
to
rawls'
attorney
and
been
informed
that
rawls
would
not
testify
if
called
to
the
stand.
we
know
that
prior
to
this
time
the
district
attorney
was
in
possession
of
conflicting
information
on
whether
or
not
rawls
is
to
testify.
a
jury
was
impaneled
in
the
next
day,
the
district
attorney
made
his
opening
statement,
in
the
course
of
the
opening
statement
he
said,
that
the
officers
had
talked
to
rawls
during
their
investigation
and
that
the
district
attorney
was
going
to
call
rawls
as
a
witness.
at
this
point,
holding
rawls
confession
in
his
hand,
the
district
attorney
proceeded
to
paraphrase
that
confession.
the
defense
moved
for
mistrial
after
the
opening
statement
which
was
denied.
later
the
district
attorney
called
rawls
to
the
stand.
rawls
appeared
with
his
attorney
and
refuse
to
testify.
defense
renewed
his
motion
for
mistrial
and
a
hearing
was
held
before
the
judge,
the
motion
was
denied.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
no,
it's
a
requirement
that
you
--
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
--
mention
in
the
opening
statement,
no
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
yes,
as
a
matter
(voice
overlap).
it
was
not
referred
to
as
a
confession.
if
you
read
the
opening
statement
which
is
in
the
appendix
on
pages
41
to
43,
they're
all
in
part,
you'll
find
that
for
instance
nearly
very
first
the
prosecutor
said,
“that
it
is
rawls'
version
that
such
and
such
occurred”
and
then
he
stopped
and
says,
“maybe
i'm
wrong.
i
will
look
here
to
see
as
to
whether
rawls
said
that
he
hit
him
first”
and
at
other
times
you
have
phrases
like
“rawls
said”
or
“it's
rawls
version.”
so
that
there
was
a
clear
inference,
one
that
the
officers
had
talked
to
rawls;
two,
that
rawls
had
given
his
version
to
the
officers;
and
three,
the
inference
is
inescapable
that
what
the
district
attorney
was
doing
was
setting
out
before
the
jury
what
rawls'
version
was
and
what
rawls
had
told
the
police.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
that
is
right,
in
fact,
the
defense
never
saw
the
written
confession
until
rawls
later
change
his
plead
of
not
guilty
and
was
introduced
in
rawls'
trial.
no
specific
instruction
was
requested
of
the
judge
and
the
judge
did
not
give
one
to
disregard
these
particular
comments
in
the
opening
statement.
the
judge
did
however
in
his
general
charge
to
the
jury
indicate
that
statements
of
counsel
are
not
evidenced.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
i
think
the
trial
lasted
approximately
a
week.
the
district
court
based
its
decision
on
this
court's
opinion
in
douglas
versus
alabama.
the
court
may
recall
in
that
case
the
prosecutor
by
means
of
leading
questions
placed
the
accomplice's
confession
before
the
jury
while
the
accomplice
is
on
the
stand
asserting
the
fifth
amendment.
the
ninth
circuit
on
the
warden
wished
to
distinguish
douglas
versus
alabama
and
the
later
case
of
bruton
versus
united
states.
on
the
ground
that
here
the
prosecutor
acted
in
good
faith
and
that
the
statement
was
not
unfairly
prejudicial
to
the
defendant.
we
submit,
however,
that
the
rule
under
douglas
and
bruton
is
that
where
the
prosecution
places
a
substance
under
accomplice's
confession
before
the
jury
and
the
defendant
is
denied
the
right
of
confrontation
if
that
is
not
subject
to
cross
examination.
we
submit
that
the
defendant
is
just
as
surely
denied
his
right
to
confront
and
cross-examine
rawls
whether
or
not
the
prosecution
acted
in
good
faith
or
in
bad
faith
or
was
merely
negligent
in
placing
this
before
the
jury.
perhaps
the
ninth
circuit
the
warden
had
confused
the
right
of
confrontation
which
is
a
fundamental
right
with
the
more
general
due
process
right
against
the
prosecutorial
misconduct.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
no,
your
honor
not
that
i
know
of.
as
far
as
i
know
it
has
never
been
--
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
as
far
as
i
know,
yes
your
honor.
the
warden
also
attempts
to
distinguish
the
douglas
case
from
the
present
case
by
saying
that
here
the
statement
was
made
in
the
opening
statement
and
was
in
the
form
of
expected
testimony,
whereas
i've
already
indicated
the
prosecutor
or
district
attorney
fairly
implied
that
rawls
had
made
a
statement,
that
rawls
had
said
these
things
so
that
he
clearly
raised
the
inference
of
past
statements
rather
than
future
statements.
certainly,
one
cannot
constitutionally
distinguish
the
remarks
of
counsel
who
made
examining
witnesses'
remarks
of
counsel
were
made
in
opening
statements.
the
right
of
confrontation
is
not
suspended
during
opening
statements.
the
warden
has
hinted
that
the
statement
was
not
prejudicial
but
we
would
point
out
that
rawls
was
the
only
other
eyewitness
to
the
crime
and
there
was
no
other
evidence
in
the
case
to
the
effect
that
frazier
strangled
marleau
and
this
was
the
key
issue
in
the
case.
nor
legally
under
chapman
versus
california,
can
one
assume
that
the
jury
forgot
or
ignored
what
the
prosecutor
said
in
his
opening
statement.
surely
when
rawls
took
the
stand
and
refused
to
testify
and
then
the
motion
for
mistrial
was
made,
the
jury
must
have
speculated
on
what
rawls
would
have
testified
and
what
was
said
in
the
opening
statement.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
i
would
say
there
was
probably
several
days.
the
prosecution
contends
that
holding
the
prosecution
accountable
what
it
says
in
its
opening
statement
would
have
an
adverse
effect
on
future
cases.
we
submit
that
this
is
not
true.
if
i
were
a
prosecutor
and
i
had
a
case
in
which
i
wanted
to
use
a
witness
who
may
or
may
not
assert
his
right
not
to
testify
and
i
have
choice,
i
can
say
nothing
in
the
opening
statement
about
this
witnesses'
testimony
and
if
he
does
not
testify
then
no
harm
has
been
made.
on
the
other
hand,
if
he
does
testify
then
in
my
closing
argument
i
can
make
all
the
mileage
out
of
it
that
i
want.
there
may
be
cases
where
the
testimony
of
this
witness
is
so
critical
to
the
prosecution's
case
and
the
prosecution
may
be
so
sure
that
this
witness
will
testify
that
the
prosecution
will
take
a
calculated
risk
or
bring
it
out
in
the
opening
statement
knowing
full
well
that
there
may
be
a
mistrial
if
the
witness
does
not
testify.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
i
would
say
that
the
effect
on
the
defendant
is
just
the
same
even
though
the
prosecutor
had
the
best
faith
in
the
world,
the
best
reason
in
the
world
that
this
man
would
testify
because
the
fact
is
that
the
right
of
confrontation
is
basic
to
our
arbitrary
system.
you
put
in
effect
that
deposition
or
a
written
statement
of
a
witness
which
is
not
subject
to
cross-examination
and
if
it
goes
before
the
jury,
no
amount
of
good
faith
will
cure
that.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
your
honor,
more
accurately
i
think
i
would
say
that
rather
than
excepting,
i
would
say
that
does
not
matter.
i
would
point
out
however,
if
the
court
should
find
that
good
faith
is
critical
then
i
would
say
that
good
faith
and
bad
faith
are
defined
variously
for
different
purposes
in
the
law,
and
i
would
say
surely
when
the
prosecutor
goes
forth
blindly
with
conflicting
information
and
does
not
confirm
or
deny
that
information
that
that
is
probably
bad
faith.
turning
to
the
admissibility
of
frazier's
concession,
at
the
time
frazier
was
taken
into
custody
--
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
what
occurred
was
that
after
rawls
refused
to
testify,
hearing
was
held
and
the
prosecutor
then
told
the
judge
under
oath
what
his
information
was
and
as
i
read
that
testimony
and
as
i
understand
it,
prior
to
the
trial,
the
prosecutor
talked
with
rawls'
attorney
or
at
least
the
prosecutor's
deputy.
rawls'
attorney
told
the
deputy
they
talked
rawls,
rawls
would
not
testify.
however,
sometime
prior
to
the
trial,
i
think
a
probation
officer
and
perhaps
a
relative
of
rawls
and
maybe
some
other
people
had
said
that
they
thought
that
rawls
would
testify
any
way.
so
in
effect
that
the
prosecutor
had
conflicting
information
when
it
came
time
for
the
trial.
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
i
do
not
believe
the
prosecutor
indicated
that
he
rechecked
on
this
information
after
that
beginning
conference.
on
the
confession
issue,
it
is
clear
that
the
investigation
had
focused
on
frazier
and
rawls
at
the
time
frazier
was
taken
into
custody.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
tape
recording
of
the
entire
interrogation.
briefly,
it
indicates
that
there
was
preliminary
question
prior
to
any
warnings
have
been
given,
at
which
time
frazier
denied
having
been
with
marleau
that
night.
frazier
was
then
told
that
he
had
a
right
to
an
attorney
and
whatever
he
said
could
be
used
against
him,
then
the
questioning
came
more
accusatory
but
frazier
still
denied
being
with
marleau.
at
that
point
the
interrogator
falsely
told
frazier
that
rawls
was
in
custody
and
that
rawls
did
tell
everything.
in
fact,
rawls
was
still
free
and
the
police
did
not
yet
talk
to
rawls.
interrogator
used
various
standard
emotional
appeals
such
that
frazier
should
not
shoulder
that
entire
blame
himself
reference
to
frazier's
dead
mother.
he
was
on
emergency
leave
for
a
funeral
at
the
time.
and
after
that
frazier
admitted
having
been
with
marleau
the
night
of
the
crime
and
he
told
the
officers
what
happened
up
until
the
time
when
the
three
arrived
at
the
scene
of
the
crime,
then
frazier
stopped,
he
said
“i
think
i
had
better
get
a
lawyer
before
i
talk
anymore.
i'm
going
to
get
into
more
trouble
than
i
am
in
now.”
the
officer
replied,
“you
can't
be
in
any
more
trouble
than
you
are
in
now”
and
then
proceeded
with
the
interrogation.
frazier
then
gave
his
entire
version
of
what
transpired
although
he
is
still
denied
that
he
strangled
(voice
overlap).
pardon
me
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
that's
right,
this
was
after
escobedo.
the
trial
was
after
escobedo
but
before
miranda.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
that's
correct
your
honor.
frazier
then
made
a
complete
oral
statement
of
what
transpired
although
he
still
denied
that
he
strangled
marleau.
the
officer
offered
to
type
up
the
statement
that
frazier
would
sign
it
pointing
out
the
officer
would
testify
to
his
oral
admissions
any
way,
and
that
he
would
have
--
be
entitled
to
an
attorney
after
arraignment
which
would
be
made
that
night.
frazier
signed
a
written
statement
then
which
contained
the
standard
warnings
and
waiver
some
of
which
were
mimeograph
others
were
typed
on
the
statement.
this
case
--
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
you
see,
your
honor
this
is
case
is
somewhat
peculiar
in
that
at
the
time
of
this
interrogation,
the
oregon
supreme
court
had
decided
the
neely
case
at
which
interpreted
escobedo
in
the
broad
sense.
it
was
one
of
the
liberal
interpretations
of
escobedo.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
that's
correct
your
honor.
so
that
officers,
i
think
only
recently
had
instituted
this
procedure
of
the
standard
phrases.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
these
were
in
the
written
statement.
of
course
these
warnings
were
not
made
at
least
the
warning
of
right
to
remain
silent
was
not
made
prior
to
his
oral
admission.
we
submit
that
the
written
statement
was
clearly
a
fruit
of
the
oral
interrogation
since
the
officers
told
them
that
they
would
testify
to
the
oral
admissions
if
he
didn't
sign
the
written
statement
so
he
might
as
well
get
into
writing.
this
case
is
also
interesting
in
another
facet
and
that
we
not
only
have
a
tape
recording
of
the
entire
interrogation
but
we
have
a
thorough
psychiatric
study
of
the
accused.
frazier
had
an
insanity
defense.
there
are
four
psychiatrists
and
psychologists
and
neurosurgeon
who
testified
at
the
trial.
we
know
that
frazier
had
a
passive
personality
as
long
as
psychiatrist
said
he
was
like
a
leaf
blowing
in
the
wind
that
he
is
subject
to
discipline
and
direction,
that
he
has
intropunitive
personality
in
which
he
tends
to
turn
the
blame
within
or
to
blame
himself
for
whatever
occurs,
that
he
was
shy
and
immature
and
of
course
we
know
that
frazier
had
no
prior
experience
with
interrogations.
on
the
--
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
yes,
your
honor,
his
--
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
that
is
correct.
she'd
been
very
ill
throughout
his
life
and
had
been
on
medication
and
had
been
abusive
at
times,
yet
he
was
still
very
close
to
her.
he
had
no
other
family
other
than
rawls.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
he
was
20
years
old
at
the
time.
with
respect
to
escobedo,
the
state
contends
that
this
was
not
an
adequate
request
for
counsel.
we
submit
that
this
timid
but
plain
request
for
counsel
is
all
that
is
required.
there
is
nothing
in
escobedo
that
requires
an
aggressive
demand
for
council.
now
frazier
had
stopped
and
said
i
won't
say
anything
more
to
give
me
attorney,
he
doesn't
need
an
attorney
because
he
won't
confess.
he
asked
for
an
attorney
and
his
request
was
turned
aside
and
ignored.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
that
is
true.
then
the
question
arises
in
this.
in
the
context
of
this
case
--
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
what
are
the
facts
and
what
are
the
critical
facts.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
of
course
the
fact
this
man's
name
is
not
danny
escobedo
is
not
a
critical
fact
to
that
case.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
yes,
that
is
the
other
distinction
which
the
state
has
put
forward
that
in
escobedo,
the
accused
already
had
an
attorney
where
here
frazier
did
not
have
an
attorney
at
the
time
he
requested
one.
we
simply
submit
that
the
fact
that
frazier
did
not
have
the
foresight
or
opportunity
to
hire
a
lawyer
before
he
is
arrested
is
not
a
valid
ground
for
distinction.
as
to
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession,
of
course
this
court
must
review
all
the
circumstances
which
it
has
a
great
deal
of
information
with
which
to
do
that,
we
submit
that
under
all
these
circumstances
this
confession
was
a
product
of
a
will
overborne.
that
this
is
a
case
where
the
will
of
a
passive,
immature,
intropunitive
person
not
previously
interrogated
was
overborne
by
aggressive
interrogation
using
falsehoods,
denial
of
request
for
counsel,
emotional
appeals
and
lack
of
warnings.
there
is
one
other
question
on
--
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
yes,
it
was
submitted
to
the
jury.
that
raises
somewhat
of
a
problem
i
believe
to
the
states
next
contention
that's
frazier
waived
his
objections
to
the
mission
of
the
confession
because
he
took
the
stand
and
testified.
the
fact
is
that
the
states
agreed
to
put
--
placing
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession
for
the
juries
so
the
issue
was
still
on
the
case
when
frazier
testified.
in
any
case,
the
series
of
state
cases
which
are
cited
in
the
bruton's
brief
state
that
if
the
accused
takes
that
stand
and
repeats
substantially
the
confession.
the
substance
of
the
confession
that
he
has
waived
the
right
to
object
to
the
introduction
of
the
confession
in
certain
circumstances,
the
first
problem
is
that
even
under
those
cases
the
state
does
not
fit
within
the
test
because
the
test
requires
that
the
defendant
not
deny,
minimize
or
explain
a
way
the
statements
in
his
confessions.
but
in
at
least
two
respects,
frazier's
testimony
under
trial
differed
from
his
written
confession
and
the
prosecution
on
cross-examination
brought
this
out
and
then
attempted
to
impeach
frazier's
credibility.
and
his
credibility
was
one
of
the
key
issues
in
the
case.
moreover
as
the
ninth
circuit
in
gladden
versus
unsworth
and
that's
not
cited
in
the
briefs,
that's
396
f.2d
373
indicated
the
state
cases
relied
upon
by
the
warden
did
not
set
forth
a
federal
standard
of
waiver.
the
federal
standard
enforces
intelligent
relinquishment
of
a
known
right
and
we
can
find
no
indication
that
frazier
when
he
agreed
to
take
the
stand
being
faced
with
the
reference
to
rawls'
testimony
and
opening
statement
intended
to
waive
his
strong
objections
to
the
mission
of
the
written
statement.
certainly,
it
cannot
be
said
that
there
was
no
prejudice
in
the
admission
of
the
written
statement.
assuming
prejudice
is
relevant
at
all
under
chapman
and
other
cases
dealing
with
forced
confessions.
the
fact
that
the
frazier's
written
statement
was
used
to
impeach
his
testimony
and
the
fact
that
the
state
may
not
have
even
made
a
prima
facie
case
without
the
written
statement,
i
think
indicates
that
there
was
prejudice.
on
the
search
and
seizure
issue,
the
facts
are
relatively
simple.
frazier
and
rawls
shared
a
bedroom
in
the
home
of
rawls'
parents.
frazier
had
all
of
his
possession
in
his
military
bag,
flight
bag,
or
duffel
bag.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
i
believe
so
although
i
do
not
believe
that
they
were
close
in
contact
with
respects.
they
were
--
i
don't
know
if
they
got
along
very
well.
the
bag
had
three
separate
compartments,
two-side
zippered
compartments
and
a
centered
compartment.
apparently,
rawls
put
some
of
his
clothing
in
the
side
zippered
compartment
or
one
of
them.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
case
whether
frazier
consented
or
not.
there
is
no
evidence
one
way
or
the
other.
we
do
know
that
from
rawls'
expected
testimony,
the
opening
statement
that
rawls'
version
is
that
he
had
permission.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
well
no
because
i'm
willing
to
assume
for
purposes
of
argument
that
frazier
consented
to
the
placing
of
the
clothes
in
the
side
compartment.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
i
have
no
objection
to
that
assumption.
the
problem
is
that
when
the
police
arrested
rawls,
they
asked
him
for
the
clothes
they
wore
the
night
of
the
crime.
he
said
that
they
could
have
them,
that
they
were
in
a
blue
flight
bag
in
his
room.
the
police
went
up,
they
took
the
bag,
and
they
took
it
back
to
headquarters
and
searched
it.
the
state
contends
that
because
rawls
was
a
joint
user
of
the
bag,
he
had
the
power
to
consent
to
the
search
of
the
bag
and
the
police
had
the
power
to
seize
whatever
they
saw
in
the
course
of
the
search.
there's
one
difficulty
with
that
however
your
honors,
that
is,
that
rawls
was
a
joint
user
of
the
only
the
side
pocket
of
the
bag.
well
i
see
its
time
for
the
recess.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
on
the
search
of
seizure
issue,
our
contention
is
quite
simple
and
straightforward.
first,
rawls
was
a
joint
user
of
only
the
side
pocket
of
the
bag
and
therefore
only
had
the
power
to
consent
to
a
search
of
the
side
pocket.
the
mere
apparent
ownership
of
the
bag
as
a
whole
would
not
be
enough
under
stoner
versus
california.
it
is
true
that
the
police
could
seize
anything
that
came
into
view
while
searching
that
side
pocket
but
under
harris
versus
untied
states,
they
could
seize
only
what
came
into
view
when
they
ran
a
place
where
they
had
the
right
to
be
and
since
the
police
had
no
power
and
no
consent
to
be
in
the
center
pocket.
they
could
not
seize
what
came
into
view
in
the
center
of
the
pocket.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
the
transcript
indicates
that
the
bulk
of
frazier's
clothing
was
found
in
the
center
compartment.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
he
just
said
it's
in
a
blue
bag
in
my
room.
that
was
the
extent
of
it.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
yes,
i
think
that
he
consented
to
their
taking
his
clothes
out
of
the
side
pocket.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
no,
no.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
they
did
not
know
but
the
fact
that
they
did
not
know
did
not
give
them
power,
is
my
position
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
well
i
would
think
that
--
let
us
suppose
that
instead
of
a
bag
--
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
yes.
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
that's
right
because
the
doctrine
of
joint
user
or
joint
use
of
a
particular
(voice
overlap).
that's
right
and
that's
established.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
they
had
--
our
position
would
be
that
they
have
no
right
to
be
in
the
center
compartment,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
well
if
they
didn't
know,
of
course
they
could
have
always
asked
but
they
did
not
your
honor
and
--
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
because
and
only
because
of
consent
of
a
joint
user.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
rawls.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
well,
he
consented
to
their
having
his
clothes
and
that
they
could
have
his
clothes.
he
told
them
generally
where
it
was
and
i
would
take
that
probably
as
being
consent
to
there
going
in
and
going
wherever
necessary
to
take
his
clothes.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
well,
i
assume
that
they
would
not
have
any
way
of
knowing.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
it
is
--
it's
a
question
of
power.
once
they
leave
the
domain
of
which
they
had
the
right
to
be
and
their
only
right
was
because
of
consent
--
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
well,
an
analogy
situation
might
be
i
suppose
that
frazier
and
rawls
joined
or
occupied
a
room
and
rawls
merely
said
that
my
clothes
are
in
this
room,
you
can
go
get
them.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
and
that,
in
that
room
was
a
dresser
exclusively
owned
and
used
by
frazier
and
the
police
not
knowing
where
rawls
clothes
were
went
in
and
searched
the
dresser.
not
knowing,
i
would
say
that
under
those
circumstances
the
police
exceeded
their
authority
and
that
they
were
in
a
place
in
which
they
did
not
have
the
consent
to
be
and
which
rawls
did
not
have
the
power
to
give
them
consent
to
be.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
no,
it
is
question
of
scope
and
power
to
consent.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
that's
right.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
it
was
exclusively
frazier's,
that's
correct.
that
is
exclusively
used
by
frazier.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
that's
right
because
that
closet
is
jointly
occupied
and
used
by
the
two
and
therefore
either
one
of
them
had
the
power
to
consent.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
that's
correct,
in
plain
view.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
any
part
of
the
grip
that
was
jointly
used
by
frazier
and
rawls
because
therefore
either
one
of
them
has
consent
to
the
search
of
that
area.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
that's
right,
that's
why
i
would
say
the
side
pocket
was
exclusively
frazier's.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
merely
say
that
it
is
true
that
the
district
attorney
did
not
refer
to
this
as
confession.
in
fact,
it
was
really
an
exculpatory
statement
and
which
the
--
suppose
accomplice
placed
all
the
blame
on
frazier.
and
throughout
this
opening
statement
such
phrases
as
“this
is
rawls'
version.”
rawls
said
that,
“he
took
--
trying
to
rob
the
bank.”
he
said,
“we
took
all
the
clothes
off
after
we
got
home
and
put
them
into
the
travel
bag.”
it
was
perfectly
clear
to
anyone
hearing
the
opening
statement
that
rawls
had
made
a
statements
to
the
police
and
that
the
district
attorney
was
telling
the
jury
what
the
statement
was
and
there
was
no
way
in
the
world
which
the
defense
could
test
that
version
of
rawls
of
cross-examination
because
rawls
refused
to
testify.
the
same
would've
been
true
if
completely
unexpected
rawls
had
died
and
did
not
testify
at
all.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
it
was
played
to
the
judge
in
chambers
in
ruling
on
expression.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
the
tape
recording
itself
is
not
but
the
transcript
is.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
no,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
that's
correct.
everything
that
is
said
has
been
transcribed
and
it
is
in
the
appendix.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
i'm
not
sure
whether
the
--
i
think
the
tape
recording
was
may
have
been
in
evidence
solely
for
the
purpose
of
the
hearing
of
a
voluntariness
of
the
confession.
it
was
never
presented
to
the
jury
or
placed
before
the
jury.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
it
was
relied
on
by
both
the
state
and
the
defense
for
purposes
of
indicating
whether
the
confession
was
voluntary
and
whether
escobedo
and
the
state
--
neely
versus
state
have
been
complied
with.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
apparently,
he
did
and
this
was
indicated
to
him
that
what
was
on
the
tape
would
be
orally
placed
in
evidence
if
he
did
not
sign
the
written
statement.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
no,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
only
for
purposes
of
ruling
on
the
voluntariness
or
admissibility
of
the
written
statement.
it
was
not
placed
before
the
jury
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
feuerstein
thank
you.
