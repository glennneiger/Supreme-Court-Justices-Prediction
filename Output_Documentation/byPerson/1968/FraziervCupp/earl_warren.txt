chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
they
speak
for
the
state
of
oregon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
district
attorney's
association?
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
made
the
request
of
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
is
he
authorized
to
speak
for
the
state
of
oregon,
the
situation
of
this
kind
or
as
the
attorney
general
who
is
authorized
to
as
someone
to
speak
for
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
vouch
for
that
as
a
matter
of
oregon
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
a
little
at
unusual
way
to
proceed.
it
seems
to
me
because
for
instance
we're
entitled
to
know
if
the
representative
of
the
state
of
oregon
is
prepared
to
vouch
for
oregon
law
and
oregon
practice
and
so
forth
and
i
was
just
wondering
as
i'm
sure
other
members
of
the
court
are
whether
you're
in
a
position
to
do
that
or
not
to
whether
any
vouch
that
you
give
for,
for
legal
situation
in
oregon
is
it
would
be
in
any
way
binding
on
oregon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
are
here
then
representing
the
state
of
oregon
and
not
the
district
attorney's
association
in
united
states?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
wondering
mr.
specter
if
they
merely
wanted
to
advise
the
jury
what
they
were
doing
why
wouldn't
have
been
sufficient
for
him
to
say
that
he
was
going
to
call
this
man
to
the
witness
stand?
why
was
it
necessary
to
tell
the
jury
they're
going
to
put
on
the
confession
that
he
made
out
of
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
state
of
oregon
take
that
same
view
of
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
they
didn't
brief
it,
you're
not
on
their
briefs?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
didn't
brief
this
subject
at
all
and
it
isn't
in
the
record
and
i
just
wondered
if
you
were
authorized
to
speak
for
the
state
of
oregon
when
you
say
that
this
is
a
situation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
that
particular
respect
when
it's
not
in
their
briefs?
chief
justice
earl
warren
with
who?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
feuerstein,
i
think
you
a
moment
or
so.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
feuerstein,
i
understand
you
were
appointed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
to
represent
this
indigent
defendant
and
that
you
have
carried
on
that
same
assignment
to
this
court,
and
this
court
considers
it
a
real
public
service
to
lawyers
who
represent
indigent
defendants
that
the
--
by
assignment
from
the
court
and
we
appreciate
what
