justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
contention
that
that
was
without
frazier's
consent?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
would
you
have
a
different
argument
--
would
your
argument
change
if
it
were
clearly
shown
that
he
did
consent?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
aren't
they
the
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
details?
he
just
said
that
it's
in
blue
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
they
were
right
to
go
inside
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
didn't
say
what
compartment
it
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
did
the
police
have
any
knowledge
where
his
close
where?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
did
he
say
that
he
can
get
into
the
side
pocket?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
doesn't
concede
that
they
were
rightfully
in
the
side
pocket?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
by
reaching
this
consent.
justice
byron
r.
white
frazier's
--
although
it's
frazier's
bag,
do
you
feel
that
he
has
no
right
to
object
to
the
police
being
at
the
side?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
police
didn't
know
--
what
if
the
police
have
gone
in
when
they
start
to
search
the
bag
headed
from
the
center
compartment
first?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
until
the
search
for
the
bag
is
complete,
you
couldn't
tell
in
which
compartment
the
police
were
allowed
to
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know
but
he
didn't
consent
for
them
to
be
on
the
side
pocket?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
consented
in
going
to
the
bag
and
look
for
his
clothes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
do
they
know
that
they
had
all
his
clothes,
what
if
they
have
gone
to
somebody's
side
pocket?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
you
would
say
that
they
had
to
quit
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
my
problem
is
it
that
it
would
seem
they
had
the
same
right
or
power
to
be
in
any
pocket
of
the
--
where
rawls
clothes
might
have
been?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
is
it
that
an
argument
that
the
legality
of
the
search
depends
on
what's
turned
up,
what
if
that
had
been
rejected?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know
but
if
rawls
clothing
in
fact
that
or
some
of
his
clothing
had
in
fact
been
in
the
middle
compartment.
you
would
have
said
that
that
was
a
lawful
search?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
any
reason
that
you're
arguing
it
was
not
is
that
instead
of
rawls
clothing
in
the
middle
of
the
pocket
they
came
out
that
it
was
frazier's?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
rawls
have
said
that
my
clothes
are
hanging
on
a
--
my
pants
are
hanging
in
a
hook
in
the
room
and
opens
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
police
and
you
may
go
get
them.
they
go
in
and
they
take
his
pants
and
then
hang
it
right
along
the
side
of
them
is
another
pair
of
pants
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
bloody
pants
and
it's
got
a
name
tag
in
them,
frazier.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
in
that
event
you
would
concede
that
they
did
seize
frazier's
pants.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
plain
view?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
can
see
that
they
were
rightly
in
the
room
and
rightfully
in
any
part
of
the
grip
where
they
could
find
rawls
clothing.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
that
opened
the
pocket
first
and
found
none
of
rawls'
clothes
but
some
of
frazier's
and
then
opened
the
middle
compartment
and
found
rawls
clothes
and
none
of
frazier's.
you
would
say
that
they
could
have
not
seized
frazier's
clothes?
justice
byron

is
there
any
contention
that
that
was
without
frazier's
consent?

well

your
argument
