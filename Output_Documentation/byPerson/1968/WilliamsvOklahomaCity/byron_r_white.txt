justice
byron
r.

why
did
the
trial
court
make
the
finding
that
the
parties
couldn't
--
that
the
party
couldn't
remember
what
went
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
he
could
have?
what
would
--
justice
byron
r.
white
he
could
have
made
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
he
could
remember
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
a
good
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
rather
relevant
here,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
you
thought
you
could
remember
--
you'd
make
plenty
of
notes
like
most
lawyers
do
in
court
and
you
made
up
a
running
account
of
what
happened
to
trial,
what
the
testimony
was,
do
you
think
that
would
be
acceptable
as
a
case-made
in
oklahoma?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
happened
to
you
in
the
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
part
of
it
is
that
you
must
have
a
transcript
to
make
a
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
now,
do
you
go
directly
up
to
an
appellate
court
from
this
municipal
court
or
is
there
an
appeal
to
the
district
court
for
de
novo
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you're
arguing
--
i
gather
from
your
brief,
you
think
you're
arguing
not
only
about
a
transcript
but
about
counsel
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
whatever
we
decide
here
also
determines
the
counsel
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
your
view?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what's
that
got
to
do
with
it
in
this
area,
serious
or
petty?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
who's
made
that
distinction
in
question
as
concerning
counsel
or
transcript?
who's
made
that
distinction
between
serious
and
petty
crime?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
do
the
states
have?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
has
in
the
federal
courts?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
haven't
we
held
up
--
haven't
we
held
that
up
to
six
months
of
the
petty
offense
here
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
reverses
the
jury
trial
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
if
the
--
you
should
a
different
--
justice
byron

view
of
it
on
the
counsel
