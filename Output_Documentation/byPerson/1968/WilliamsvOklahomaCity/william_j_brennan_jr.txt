justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
does
this
all
come
down
to
this
mr.
gray
that
you're
saying
to
us
that
whatever
oklahoma
might
adopt
in
the
way
of
some
substantive
facts,
the
present
factors
from
it
on
appeal
only
on
short
form
or
on
case-made.
this
case
is
inappropriate
for
short
form
and
you're
denied
case-made
because
you
can't
afford
to
pay
for
the
transcript.
therefore,
this
practice
in
those
circumstances
is
unconstitutional.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
mean
in
this
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
that
this
court
has
refused
to
review
some
instances
of
offenses
which
carried
no
more
punishment
than
90
days
at
least.
we
refuse
to
review
refusals
to
provide
counsel.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
think
we
have
to
reach
that
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
wouldn't
think
so.
i
suppose
you
suggest
this
in
congress
if
you
prevail
on
the
right
to
transcript
like
it
wouldn't
necessarily
follow.
you'll
also
take
the
right
to
a
counsel.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
even
for
15
days,
20
days?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
is
this
a
matter
of
oklahoma
constitution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
wonder
if
it
does
because
--
at
least,
am
i
wrong
about
this
mr.
gray
to
the
extent
we've
dealt
at
all
with
the
distinction
between
petty
and
serious
or
petty
or
non-petty
whichever
way
you
want
to
phrase
it.
we
have
indicated,
have
we
not
that
there
are
certain
of
the
guarantees,
notably
jury
trial
which
do
not
apply
if
the
offense
whatever
or
however
serious
carries
with
it
a
punishment
not
exceeding
six
months,
have
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
there
we've
drawn
the
distinction
on
the
time
of
a
rather
a
length
of
imprisonment
which
the
offense
may
carry.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
haven't
drawn
the
line
based
on
whether
the
offense
is
serious
or
non-serious.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
this
your
submission
mr.
gray
that
on
this
business
of
an
extension
of
right
to
counsel
if
that's
what
it's
to
be
and
the
determination
should
be
made
on
the
basis
of
the
criterion
called
seriousness
of
the
offense
rather
than
by
focusing
primarily
on
the
punishment
that
the
offense
carries?
is
that
what
you're
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
did
this
petitioner
have
an
attorney?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
how
was
this
issue
of
right
to
counsel
came
out?
