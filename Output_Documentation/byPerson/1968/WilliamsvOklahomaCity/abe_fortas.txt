justice
abe
fortas
of
course
it
matter
in
which
word
does
that
word
“case-made”
come
from?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
do
i
--
mr.
gray,
do
i
correctly
understand
that
the
question
here
is
not
whether
he
has
a
right
to
appeal.
he
can
appeal.
justice
abe
fortas
and
on
that
appeal,
he
would
get
the
transcript
which
you
refer.
what
do
you
referred
to
it
as?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
no.
justice
abe
fortas
the
reporter's
transcript.
justice
abe
fortas
he
would
get
that
without
paying
for
it,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
so
the
only
question
here
is
not
his
right
of
appeal
but
it's
whether
he
can
have
a
right
as
you
would
put
it
i
suppose
whether
he's
got
a
right
of
effective
appeal
in
the
sense
that
he
can
obtain
without
paying
before
it
the
stenographic
report
of
the
--
what
transpired
at
his
trial.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
gray,
as
i
remember
your
brief,
what
the
points
that
you
rely
on
to
show
that
griffin
ought
to
be
applied
in
this
case
that
is
to
say
that
the
state
ought
to
be
required
to
furnish
without
a
cost
to
an
indigent
the
--
such
a
transcript
as
is
necessary
for
effect
of
appeal.
that's
what
you're
trying
to
get
us
to
hold,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
in
order
to
support
the
argument
that
this
is
a
kind
of
case
in
that
category,
you
point
out
that
this
is
a
case
in
which
that
the
jury
trial
has
required,
that's
point
one,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
second
thing
as
i
remember
is
you
say
that
this
is
regarded
that
driving
while
under
the
influence
of
intoxicating
liquor
is
regarded
as
malum
in
se
under
your
cases.
justice
abe
fortas
sorry?
justice
abe
fortas
and
in
this
court.
and
then
you
are
pointing
out,
is
there
some
provision
in
the
oklahoma
constitution
to
which
you
refer
us
with
respect
to
the
serious
definition
of
a
serious
offense?
justice
abe
fortas
it
has
to
have
a
jury
trial.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
what
is
the
limit
in
your
constitution?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
or
any
imprisonment.
justice
abe
fortas
concerning
your
oklahoma
constitution
in
the
amendment.
justice
abe
fortas
and
in
this
case,
the
penalty
did
include
imprisonment
and
prison
term
was
actually
imposed,
was
it?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
but
i
mean
to
say
the
judgment
include
it.
justice
abe
fortas
of
course
it

in
which
