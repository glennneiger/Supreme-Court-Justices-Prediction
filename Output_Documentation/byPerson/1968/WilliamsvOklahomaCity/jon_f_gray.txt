mr.
jon
f.
gray
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
below
has
been
completely
barred
from
his
statutory
right
to
appeal
the
criminal
conviction
against
him
and
this
bar
has
been
solely
upon
the
basis
of
his
poverty.
we
therefore
contend
that
the
case
before
your
honors
today
is
on
all
force
or
even
a
stronger
case
than
that
presented
to
this
court
in
the
case
of
griffin
versus
illinois
and
following
cases
in
which
this
court
has
held
that
for
decade
that
the
state
may
not
withdraw
a
right
of
appeal
from
a
person
upon
any
invidious
discrimination
such
as
poverty.
the
respondents
raised
two
points,
their
first
point
is
that
there
is
some
adequate
alternative
method
of
appeal
open
to
us
and
their
second
point
is
that
the
griffin
rule
should
not
apply
since
the
offense
convicted
in
this
case
and
appealed
from
is
a
petty
offense
with
which
we
disagree.
in
oklahoma
as
was
the
situation
in
illinois
at
the
time
of
griffin
case
there
are
two
methods
of
appeal.
there
is
a
short
form
of
appeal
which
is
the
clerk's
transcript
then
contains
barely
the
few
papers
of
record.
it
is
conceded
in
respondents'
brief
at
page
8
and
it
was
so
held
by
the
trial
court
that
this
method
of
appeal
is
inadequate
in
this
case.
the
second
method
of
appeal
available
in
oklahoma
is
the
long
form
which
we
call
a
“case-made”
and
which
respondents
agree
at
their
brief
in
page
4
is
the
method
in
which
the
court
reporter's
transcript
evolved
with
the
evidence
and
all
of
the
proceedings
and
all
of
the
instruments
are
made
up
and
presented
to
the
appellate
court.
now,
turning
to
their
first
point,
that
there
is
an
adequate
alternative
method
the
response
assert
that
the
defendant
should
have
made
up
a
statement
of
the
evidence
for
memory
in
early
form
and
submitted
it
and
i
quote
from
page
8
of
their
brief,
“in
lieu
of
the
case-made”
and
that
therefore,
we
would
have
an
alternate
method
of
appeal.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
your
honor,
the
statute
as
far
as
i
can
tell
states
that
the
party
shall
make
up
a
case
and
that
the
statute
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
i
think
that's
where
it
come
from.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
yes.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
it's
section
on
page
39.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
right.
now,
the
facts
of
this
case
which
we
say
bring
this
case
within
griffin
rule
is
that
the
defendant
who
is
conceded
in
this
case
to
be
indigent.
he
was
a
hospital
janitor
making
about
$55.00
a
week
and
supporting
11
children.
the
defendant
was
convicted
in
the
municipal
court
of
oklahoma
city
after
a
trial
and
this
is
important,
a
trial
by
a
12-man
jury
and
was
convicted
of
the
crime
of
driving,
and
this
is
also
critical,
driving
under
the
influence,
not
drunk-driving
for
everybody
knows
what
drunk-driving
is,
but
driving
under
the
influence
and
he
was
sentenced
to
serve
90
days
in
jail
and
paid
a
fine
of
$50.00
under
a
statute
in
which
the
maximum
sentence
is
90
days
in
jail
and
$100.00.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
degree,
your
honor.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
i
think
in
the
drunk
--
if
he
was
charged
with
drunk-driving,
and
i
know
of
no
common
statute
that
sets
about
that
charge
but
i
understand
some
states
have
them
that
the
prosecution
would
have
to
prove
that
the
defendant
was
drunk,
drunk
on
his
mind,
they
drunk
out
--
and
in
this
case,
the
prosecution
only
has
to
prove
that
the
defendant
had
enough
alcohol
to
influence
his
driving
to
some
degree
which
would
render
him
incapable
of
safely
driving.
and
that's
the
distinction
that
i
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
right.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
i
know
--
as
far
as
i
know
of,
there's
no
drunk-driving
statute
in
oklahoma,
just
the
driving
under
the
influence.
the
defendant
filed
his
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
attached
thereto
the
sworn
affidavit
that
the
person
who
was
driving
the
car
at
the
time
of
the
so-called
alleged
accident
but
that
motion
for
new
trial
was
overruled
and
he
requested
a
case-made
in
forma
pauperis.
it
is
recognized
by
the
trial
court
and
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
would
have
an
absolute
right
to
appeal
if
he
would
pay
for
the
court
reporter's
notes.
the
respondents
have
attached
as
an
exhibit
to
their
first
brief
in
this
case
a
transcript
of
the
hearing
and
the
trial
court
conceded
this
point.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
right.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
the
“case-made”,
yes.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
the
court
reporter's
transcript?
mr.
jon
f.
gray
right.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
that's
correct.
it
has
been
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
that's
very
well
put
and
it
was
conceded
by
and
expressly
stated
by
both
courts
that
if
he
had
been
convicted
of
the
felony
in
district
court,
he
would
have
been
given
this
transcript
without
cost.
now,
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
at
the
hearing
on
our
request
for
a
court
reporter's
transcript,
the
trial
court
held
several
findings
of
fact
which
are
lengthy
but
briefly
the
important
ones
are
and
it
is
for
this
reason
that
we
contend
this
case
is
stronger
than
griffin.
the
trial
court
held
that
we
have
the
legal
need
for
the
long
form
of
appeal
and
that
the
short
form
is
inadequate.
the
second
important
point
that
the
trial
court
found
is
that
our
appeal
is
not
without
merit
which
is
similar
to
a
federal
court
finding
that
the
appeal
is
not
frivolous;
and
the
third
point
that
strikes
right
at
the
heart
of
the
respondents'
first
contention
is
that
the
defendant,
neither
the
defendant
nor
his
attorney
could
compile
for
memory
an
adequate
narrative
statement,
an
adequate
transcript.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
well,
the
trial
court
your
honor
heard
the
pretrial
hearing
and
they
have
pretrials
in
this
court
and
heard
the
trial
and
heard
our
motions
and
our
arguments
and
of
course
in
taking
all
of
that
into
consideration,
i
assume,
he
felt
it
not
unreasonable
that
we
can
remember
all
of
the
important
points
of
the
case.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
it
took
approximately
one
day.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
your
honor,
the
only
thing
that
i
can
respond
to
in
that
regard
is
this
court's
holding
in
the
gardner
case
which
was
rendered
at
the
time
my
brief
was
turned
in
so
it's
not
in
my
brief
but
this
court
pointed
out
that
certainly,
a
lawyer
would
be
lost
without
a
transcript
and
even
preparing
the
petition
for
review
and
that
is
the
position
in
this
court
today.
i
don't
know
how
short
the
hearing
would
have
to
be.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
i
think
there
were
approximately
four,
four
witnesses.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
yes.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
yes
sir,
that's
my
memory.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
yes,
they
do
your
honor
and
we
admit
that
oklahoma
could
establish
such
a
procedure.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
no,
i
say
that
we
admit
that
they
could
and
that
would
be
a
reasonable
alternative.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
well,
your
honor,
the
two
methods
of
appeal
are
the
clerk's
transcript
which
contains
only
the
bare
pleadings
in
the
case,
the
information,
the
minutes
and
the
judgment,
and
the
case-made
that
we've
discussed.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
yes,
sir.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
there
is
none
that
i
have
found
and
if
there
is,
it's
appointed
it
has
escaped
also
defense
counsel
and
the
trial
court
because
this
has
all
been
discussed
in
the
hearing.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
well,
he
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
what
if
he
could
have?
your
honor
i
don't
know
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
well,
there
are
many
cases
in
oklahoma
that
set
out
the
requirements
for
a
free
case-made
and
one
of
them
is
that
neither
the
party
nor
their
attorney
can
make
up
a
transcript
from
memory
and
we
requested
the
trial
court
rule
on
this
issue
and
he
did
so
and
he
ruled
that
it
would
not
be
reasonable
to
require
us
to
make
up
a
transcript
from
memory.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
that's
a
good
question
your
honor.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
i
don't
know.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
yes,
it
is.
it's
relevant
but
it
is
not
one
that
this
court
need
get
to.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
i've
tried
that
your
honor
and
in
a
case
exactly
in
the
same
court,
and
that
has
been
the
petition
for
certiorari
has
been
year
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
in
the
state
court,
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
did
rule
that
the
petition
for
writ
of
mandamus
was
denied
for
the
same
reason
as
it
was
denied
in
this
case.
and
because
the
defendant
there
was
employed
and
i
think
there
was
one
other
situation
that
went
to
his
earnings
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
right.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
right.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
but
in
other
words,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
oklahoma
did
not
rule
in
that
case
that
we
couldn't
have
the
case
made
because
we
could
remember
the
testimony.
i
think
its
unfortunate
they
didn't
speak
to
that
point.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
that's
correct.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
in
this
case.
right.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
well,
we
believe
that
goes
for
all.
all
we're
asking
this
court
to
get
to
is
that
that
goes
for
all
serious
criminal
convictions.
and
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
i
have
not
seen
any.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
right,
it's
court
of
record.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
that's
correct.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
statutes
have
given
the
same
court
reporter
to
the
municipal
criminal
court
of
record
in
oklahoma
city
as
they
have
given
to
the
district
court
which
is
the
court
of
the
general
jurisdiction.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
that's
right.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
the
statutes
on
the
court
reporter
salary
set
in
our
brief
that
briefly
they
are
that
the
court
reporter
is
paid
a
salary
and
then
he
may
charge
the
individual
appellant
per
page.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
right,
per
copy.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
prior
to
the
inception
of
this
court
in
1965,
the
appeals
of
this
type
of
case
went
to
the
district
court
then
they
instituted
this
court
and
the
appeals
are
exactly
as
in
the
district
court
straight
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
the
state
of
oklahoma.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
no,
your
honor.
there
is
one
trial
in
the
municipal
court
and
then
you
appeal
that
finding
to
the
appellate
court
in
the
state.
so
the
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
the
trial
court
has
negated
this
first
point
that
there
is
no
alternative
record
and
the
only
basis
for
their
argument
is
the
1918
harris
case
which
was
adopted
at
the
time
when
the
court
reporter
took
down
all
the
testimony
in
longhand
and
the
judge
who
find
that
there
--
the
attorney
might
as
well
do.
there
is
no
need
to
remand
this
case
therefore
as
the
respondents
request
since
both
courts
have
ruled
upon
the
issue
and
have
stated
the
issue
to
be
a
lack
of
statutory
authority
that
was
expressly
the
trial
court's
ruling
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
denied
the
petition
expressly
because
the
u.s.
supreme
court
had
not
intimidated
that
a
person
convicted
of
a
quasi-crime
or
a
petty
offense
could
get
an
appeal
by
case-made.
now,
the
issue
of
quasi
crime
which
was
briefed
well
in
the
court
below
as
apparently
been
abandoned
by
respondents
and
i'll
submit
it
on
my
third
argument
in
my
brief
covers
quasi
crime
to
think
it's
clear
there
is
no
quasi
crime,
that's
relevant
in
this
case.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
that's
correct.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
that's
the
maximum
under
the
city
ordinance.
right.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
that
turns
to
the
issue
of
the
petty
offense
your
honor
and
the
short
answer
is
yes.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
and
this
is
why.
because
our
contention
is
that
this
is
a
serious
crime.
there
are
as
your
honor
is
well
aware
in
this
discussions,
petty-serious
crimes,
there
are
two
elements.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
well,
the
--
usually,
the
past
determination
of
whether
it's
serious
or
petty
has
come
from
the
type
of
penalty
and
the
type
of
crime
but
we
think
it
goes
deeper
than
that.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
most
of
the
cases
do
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
no,
most
of
the
cases
--
most
of
the
cases
involving
the
petty-serious
distinction
have
been
jury
trial
issues.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
and
i
think
there
had
been
one
or
two
cases
involving
the
right
to
counsel.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
under
that
impression
your
honor,
i
can't
cite
you
one
right
now.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
no.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
well
no,
your
honor,
i
don't.
and
this
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
we
believe
that
in
serious
crime,
and
that's
why
we
think
the
right
to
counsel
is
important.
if
this
is
a
petty
crime,
possibly
we
wouldn't
have
a
right
to
counsel.
but
it's
a
serious
crime
and
since
it's
a
serious
crime,
we
have
a
right
to
a
fair
jury
trial
including
the
right
to
counsel,
a
fair
preliminary
hearing
and
a
fair
appellate
procedure
and
it's
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
without
counsel
would
be
half
a
loaf.
and
in
this
case,
there
had
been
no
oklahoma
cases
cited
to
this
court
in
which
the
court
said
that
this
situation
is
a
petty
offense.
so
turning
the
court
to
the
case
of
duncan
versus
louisiana
for
example
as
a
guide,
this
court
said
that
if
we
look
to
the
laws
of
the
locality
as
a
gauge
of
the
social
and
ethical
judgments,
we
see
that
the
crime
in
this
case
is
serious
for
the
singular
reason
that
for
50
years,
for
50
years,
the
state
of
oklahoma
has
given
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
based
upon
due
process
and
that
in
all
cases
in
which
there
is
any
incarceration,
in
all
cases
in
which
there's
any
incarceration,
the
oklahoma
courts
have
held
that
due
process
requires
a
jury
trial.
and
for
instance
franks
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
yes
sir,
even
for
one
day.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
well,
settled
to
oklahoma
constitutional
law
and
oklahoma
case
law
based
upon
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
yes
sir,
the
court
certainly
has.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
yes,
sir.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
no.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
no
sir,
we
concede
the
fact
that
there
is
at
some
place
a
petty
offense
but
this
court
need
not
re-examine
the
roots
of
the
petty-serious
offense
distinction
because
in
this
case,
it's
a
serious
crime.
it's
a
serious
crime
because
oklahoma
has
always
construed
this
type
of
crime
to
be
a
serious
offense.
did
that
answer
your
honor's
question?
mr.
jon
f.
gray
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
duncan
case,
you
implied
that
if
the
punishment
was
under
six
months,
there
would
be
no
right
to
a
jury
trial.
but
we
think
that
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
right.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
no,
your
honor.
it
was
my
reading
of
the
cases.
the
sixth
month
--
the
sixth-month
line
is
result
of
finding
that
as
i
understand
that
under
six
months,
it's
not
serious
and
over
six
months
it
is
serious
but
we'll
argue
that
there
are
more
considerations
than
the
mere
six-month
penalty.
your
honor
knows
well
that
there's
long
been
discussed,
there
are
two
elements,
the
length
of
the
penalty
as
well
as
the
seriousness
of
the
crime.
and
in
the
oklahoma
court
and
other
cases
cited
in
our
brief
in
pages
17
and
pages
28.
for
example
in
1918,
franks
versus
muskogee
gets
to
the
point
when
a
defendant
is
convicted
of
an
offense
carrying
a
maximum
offense,
a
$25.00
fine
is
the
maximum
penalty
and
this
court
held,
i
mean
the
oklahoma
court
held
that
in
any
regard
to
ordinance
violations,
any
crime
in
which
carries
imprisonment
is
an
essential
part
of
the
tribunal
and
in
this
case
that
i'm
mentioning
to
you,
the
defendant
could
be
jailed
for
failing
to
pay
a
fine
which
emphasizes
my
point
that
if
there's
one
day
of
imprisonment,
in
oklahoma
that's
a
serious
crime.
ex
parte
monroe
also
pointed
out.
it's
another
oklahoma
case
cited
in
our
brief,
that
it
was
never
contemplated
that
a
police
court
which
is
not
a
court
of
record
could
try
crimes
involving
incarceration.
now,
there
are
precedents
in
this
court,
callan
versus
wilson,
was
$25.00
fine
and
a
30-day
imprisonment
penalty
and
in
1888,
this
court
held
that
was
serious.
in
the
case
of
district
of
columbia
versus
colts,
the
charge
is
reckless
driving
which
we
think
to
be
a
lesser
including
offense
and
the
court
held
that
that
was
indictable
under
the
common
law.
it
was
shocking
to
the
general
moral
sense
and
state
cases
have
since
continued
that
evaluation
of
the
charge
of
reckless
driving
to
be
a
serious
offense.
there
are
--
our
contention
is
that
in
deciding
whether
a
crime
is
serious
or
not,
there
are
other
legal
indicia
besides
the
length
of
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
we
believe
that
the
right
to
counsel
is
part
of
the
baggage
of
the
jury
trial.
i
don't
know
if
that
answers
your
question
and
i
submit
that
the
right
to
counsel
shouldn't
depend
upon
an
arbitrary
imprisonment,
a
time
of
imprisonment.
it
should
depend
upon
whether
the
crime
is
serious
or
not
and
in
the
past,
this
court
had
said
there
are
two
considerations.
we're
arguing
today
that
there
are
many
considerations
about
whether
a
crime
is
serious.
the
right
to
counsel
that
you're
speaking
of
is
extended
in
oklahoma
by
a
statute
and
oklahoma
state
constitution
as
i
mentioned
and
it's
an
essential
part
of
the
jury
trial
and
also
the
city
of
oklahoma
city
has
an
attorney
and
it
certainly
would
be
a
violation
of
due
process
and
equal
protection
we
contend
to
try
a
man
with
a
jury
trial
when
the
city
of
oklahoma
city
has
an
attorney
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
yes,
sir.
i
was
his
attorney
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
well,
we're
indicating
that
since
there
is
a
right
to
counsel
that
is
another
indication
of
the
seriousness
of
the
crime.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
i
think
that
is
the
correct
position.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
well,
i
see
what
you
mean,
your
honor.
i
think
this
court
need
not
get
that
point
but
i
think
you're
right.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
that's
correct.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
yes,
sir.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
the
case
in
which
the
jury
trial
has
required
and
given.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
yes
that
is
right.
it
is
required
but
even
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
that's
right,
in
our
cases
and
in
this
court.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
in
our
cases
and
in
this
court.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
no,
your
honor.
the
definition
of
the
serious
offense
we
contend
comes
from
the
old
oklahoma
case
that's
cited
in
our
brief
which
construed
the
due
process
clause
to
mean
that
any
crime
which
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
that's
right.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
for
jury
trial?
mr.
jon
f.
gray
the
limit
that
applies
to
this
case
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
--
is
anything
over
a
$20.00
fine
or
any
imprisonment.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
right.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
that's
correct.
but
in
the
amendment,
they
have
left
the
imprisonment
requirement
if
there
is
still
any
imprisonment
if
the
serious
crime
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
no.
no,
it's
a
state
pending
this
appeal.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
yes,
90
days,
a
maximum
of
90
days
incarceration.
this
--
of
course
this
court
is
a
court
of
record
and
on
your
question
as
to
the
right
to
a
jury
trial,
our
position
is
that
since
we
do
have
a
right
to
a
jury
trial,
that
is
the
indication
of
seriousness
of
the
crime.
but
the
other
indication
as
to
which
we
submit
that
this
court
may
consider
are
the
seriousness,
serious
is
a
relative
term
and
should
be
related
to
something
other
than
some
other
length
of
punishment.
for
example,
a
$50.00
fine
given
to
a
wealthy
man
would
certainly
not
be
serious
but
given
to
a
man
earning
$50.00
a
week
and
supporting
11
children
is
serious.
now,
i
think
that's
a
proper
consideration.
there
are
other
gauges
of
social
and
ethical
judgments
of
the
locality
by
some
authors
have
termed
the
extra
legal
consequences
such
as
the
loss
of
job
or
for
example
if
a
school
teacher
were
given
a
three-month
jail
term
wrongfully,
that
would
be
a
serious
offense.
so
we
think
this
court
or
any
court
need
not
stop
just
as
the
penalty
of
the
three-month,
whether
it
be
three
months
or
six
months
to
look
at
the
seriousness
of
the
crime.
it
is
interesting
that
in
the
duncan
versus
louisiana
case,
the
state
level
was
two
years
and
that
was
the
level
of
which
we're
being
attacked
whereas
the
federal
level
is
six
months.
in
this
case,
the
state
level
is
any
imprisonment
and
in
the
duncan
case,
they
were
asking
this
court
to
improve
the
individual
protections
and
bring
it
down
to
the
federal
level.
in
this
case,
we're
asking
to
prove
the
individual
protections
by
leaving
the
dividing
lines
where
it
is
in
oklahoma
at
any
imprisonment.
so
we
asked
this
court
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
right.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
right
and
a
court
reporter.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
in
this
particular
court.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
imprisonment,
that's
correct.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
the
municipal
criminal
court
is
a
city
court
of
record
established
especially
by
statute
and
all
of
the
statutes
which
regard
its
procedure
are
set
out
in
a
special
section
separate
from
the
statute.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
no
it
is
just
in
oklahoma
city.
there
are
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
right.
the
--
in
19
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
yes,
your
honor,
that's
essentially
correct.
in
other
counties,
there
are
county
courts
except
that
in
1968,
we
had
a
constitutional
revision
and
the
laws
were
changed
but
it
doesn't
affect
this
case
because
the
new
laws
specifically
on
appeal
at
least
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
in
oklahoma
city,
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
yes
sir,
everyday.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
yes
sir,
statutory,
right.
thank
you.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
below
has
been
completely
barred
from
his
statutory
right
to
appeal
the
criminal
conviction
against
him
and
this
bar
has
been
solely
upon
the
basis
of
his
poverty.
we
therefore
contend
that
the
case
before
your
honors
today
is
on
all
force
or
even
a
stronger
case
than
that
presented
to
this
court
in
the
case
of
griffin
versus
illinois
and
following
cases
in
which
this
court
has
held
that
for
decade
that
the
state
may
not
withdraw
a
right
of
appeal
from
a
person
upon
any
invidious
discrimination
such
as
poverty.
the
respondents
raised
two
points,
their
first
point
is
that
there
is
some
adequate
alternative
method
of
appeal
open
to
us
and
their
second
point
is
that
the
griffin
rule
should
not
apply
since
the
offense
convicted
in
this
case
and
appealed
from
is
a
petty
offense
with
which
we
disagree.
in
oklahoma
as
was
the
situation
in
illinois
at
the
time
of
griffin
case
there
are
two
methods
of
appeal.
there
is
a
short
form
of
appeal
which
is
the
clerk's
transcript
then
contains
barely
the
few
papers
of
record.
it
is
conceded
in
respondents'
brief
at
page
8
and
it
was
so
held
by
the
trial
court
that
this
method
of
appeal
is
inadequate
in
this
case.
the
second
method
of
appeal
available
in
oklahoma
is
the
long
form
which
we
call
a
“case-made”
and
which
respondents
agree
at
their
brief
in
page
4
is
the
method
in
which
the
court
reporter's
transcript
evolved
with
the
evidence
and
all
of
the
proceedings
and
all
of
the
instruments
are
made
up
and
presented
to
the
appellate
court.
now,
turning
to
their
first
point,
that
there
is
an
adequate
alternative
method
the
response
assert
that
the
defendant
should
have
made
up
a
statement
of
the
evidence
for
memory
in
early
form
and
submitted
it
and
i
quote
from
page
8
of
their
brief,
“in
lieu
of
the
case-made”
and
that
therefore,
we
would
have
an
alternate
method
of
appeal.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
your
honor,
the
statute
as
far
as
i
can
tell
states
that
the
party
shall
make
up
a
case
and
that
the
statute
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
i
think
that's
where
it
come
from.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
yes.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
it's
section
on
page
39.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
right.
now,
the
facts
of
this
case
which
we
say
bring
this
case
within
griffin
rule
is
that
the
defendant
who
is
conceded
in
this
case
to
be
indigent.
he
was
a
hospital
janitor
making
about
$55.00
a
week
and
supporting
11
children.
the
defendant
was
convicted
in
the
municipal
court
of
oklahoma
city
after
a
trial
and
this
is
important,
a
trial
by
a
12-man
jury
and
was
convicted
of
the
crime
of
driving,
and
this
is
also
critical,
driving
under
the
influence,
not
drunk-driving
for
everybody
knows
what
drunk-driving
is,
but
driving
under
the
influence
and
he
was
sentenced
to
serve
90
days
in
jail
and
paid
a
fine
of
$50.00
under
a
statute
in
which
the
maximum
sentence
is
90
days
in
jail
and
$100.00.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
degree,
your
honor.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
i
think
in
the
drunk
--
if
he
was
charged
with
drunk-driving,
and
i
know
of
no
common
statute
that
sets
about
that
charge
but
i
understand
some
states
have
them
that
the
prosecution
would
have
to
prove
that
the
defendant
was
drunk,
drunk
on
his
mind,
they
drunk
out
--
and
in
this
case,
the
prosecution
only
has
to
prove
that
the
defendant
had
enough
alcohol
to
influence
his
driving
to
some
degree
which
would
render
him
incapable
of
safely
driving.
and
that's
the
distinction
that
i
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
right.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
i
know
--
as
far
as
i
know
of,
there's
no
drunk-driving
statute
in
oklahoma,
just
the
driving
under
the
influence.
the
defendant
filed
his
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
attached
thereto
the
sworn
affidavit
that
the
person
who
was
driving
the
car
at
the
time
of
the
so-called
alleged
accident
but
that
motion
for
new
trial
was
overruled
and
he
requested
a
case-made
in
forma
pauperis.
it
is
recognized
by
the
trial
court
and
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
would
have
an
absolute
right
to
appeal
if
he
would
pay
for
the
court
reporter's
notes.
the
respondents
have
attached
as
an
exhibit
to
their
first
brief
in
this
case
a
transcript
of
the
hearing
and
the
trial
court
conceded
this
point.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
right.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
the
“case-made”,
yes.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
the
court
reporter's
transcript?
mr.
jon
f.
gray
right.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
that's
correct.
it
has
been
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
that's
very
well
put
and
it
was
conceded
by
and
expressly
stated
by
both
courts
that
if
he
had
been
convicted
of
the
felony
in
district
court,
he
would
have
been
given
this
transcript
without
cost.
now,
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
at
the
hearing
on
our
request
for
a
court
reporter's
transcript,
the
trial
court
held
several
findings
of
fact
which
are
lengthy
but
briefly
the
important
ones
are
and
it
is
for
this
reason
that
we
contend
this
case
is
stronger
than
griffin.
the
trial
court
held
that
we
have
the
legal
need
for
the
long
form
of
appeal
and
that
the
short
form
is
inadequate.
the
second
important
point
that
the
trial
court
found
is
that
our
appeal
is
not
without
merit
which
is
similar
to
a
federal
court
finding
that
the
appeal
is
not
frivolous;
and
the
third
point
that
strikes
right
at
the
heart
of
the
respondents'
first
contention
is
that
the
defendant,
neither
the
defendant
nor
his
attorney
could
compile
for
memory
an
adequate
narrative
statement,
an
adequate
transcript.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
well,
the
trial
court
your
honor
heard
the
pretrial
hearing
and
they
have
pretrials
in
this
court
and
heard
the
trial
and
heard
our
motions
and
our
arguments
and
of
course
in
taking
all
of
that
into
consideration,
i
assume,
he
felt
it
not
unreasonable
that
we
can
remember
all
of
the
important
points
of
the
case.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
it
took
approximately
one
day.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
your
honor,
the
only
thing
that
i
can
respond
to
in
that
regard
is
this
court's
holding
in
the
gardner
case
which
was
rendered
at
the
time
my
brief
was
turned
in
so
it's
not
in
my
brief
but
this
court
pointed
out
that
certainly,
a
lawyer
would
be
lost
without
a
transcript
and
even
preparing
the
petition
for
review
and
that
is
the
position
in
this
court
today.
i
don't
know
how
short
the
hearing
would
have
to
be.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
i
think
there
were
approximately
four,
four
witnesses.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
yes.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
yes
sir,
that's
my
memory.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
yes,
they
do
your
honor
and
we
admit
that
oklahoma
could
establish
such
a
procedure.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
no,
i
say
that
we
admit
that
they
could
and
that
would
be
a
reasonable
alternative.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
well,
your
honor,
the
two
methods
of
appeal
are
the
clerk's
transcript
which
contains
only
the
bare
pleadings
in
the
case,
the
information,
the
minutes
and
the
judgment,
and
the
case-made
that
we've
discussed.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
yes,
sir.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
there
is
none
that
i
have
found
and
if
there
is,
it's
appointed
it
has
escaped
also
defense
counsel
and
the
trial
court
because
this
has
all
been
discussed
in
the
hearing.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
well,
he
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
what
if
he
could
have?
your
honor
i
don't
know
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
well,
there
are
many
cases
in
oklahoma
that
set
out
the
requirements
for
a
free
case-made
and
one
of
them
is
that
neither
the
party
nor
their
attorney
can
make
up
a
transcript
from
memory
and
we
requested
the
trial
court
rule
on
this
issue
and
he
did
so
and
he
ruled
that
it
would
not
be
reasonable
to
require
us
to
make
up
a
transcript
from
memory.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
that's
a
good
question
your
honor.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
i
don't
know.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
yes,
it
is.
it's
relevant
but
it
is
not
one
that
this
court
need
get
to.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
i've
tried
that
your
honor
and
in
a
case
exactly
in
the
same
court,
and
that
has
been
the
petition
for
certiorari
has
been
year
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
in
the
state
court,
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
did
rule
that
the
petition
for
writ
of
mandamus
was
denied
for
the
same
reason
as
it
was
denied
in
this
case.
and
because
the
defendant
there
was
employed
and
i
think
there
was
one
other
situation
that
went
to
his
earnings
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
right.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
right.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
but
in
other
words,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
oklahoma
did
not
rule
in
that
case
that
we
couldn't
have
the
case
made
because
we
could
remember
the
testimony.
i
think
its
unfortunate
they
didn't
speak
to
that
point.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
that's
correct.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
in
this
case.
right.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
well,
we
believe
that
goes
for
all.
all
we're
asking
this
court
to
get
to
is
that
that
goes
for
all
serious
criminal
convictions.
and
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
i
have
not
seen
any.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
right,
it's
court
of
record.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
that's
correct.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
statutes
have
given
the
same
court
reporter
to
the
municipal
criminal
court
of
record
in
oklahoma
city
as
they
have
given
to
the
district
court
which
is
the
court
of
the
general
jurisdiction.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
that's
right.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
the
statutes
on
the
court
reporter
salary
set
in
our
brief
that
briefly
they
are
that
the
court
reporter
is
paid
a
salary
and
then
he
may
charge
the
individual
appellant
per
page.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
right,
per
copy.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
prior
to
the
inception
of
this
court
in
1965,
the
appeals
of
this
type
of
case
went
to
the
district
court
then
they
instituted
this
court
and
the
appeals
are
exactly
as
in
the
district
court
straight
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
the
state
of
oklahoma.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
no,
your
honor.
there
is
one
trial
in
the
municipal
court
and
then
you
appeal
that
finding
to
the
appellate
court
in
the
state.
so
the
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
the
trial
court
has
negated
this
first
point
that
there
is
no
alternative
record
and
the
only
basis
for
their
argument
is
the
1918
harris
case
which
was
adopted
at
the
time
when
the
court
reporter
took
down
all
the
testimony
in
longhand
and
the
judge
who
find
that
there
--
the
attorney
might
as
well
do.
there
is
no
need
to
remand
this
case
therefore
as
the
respondents
request
since
both
courts
have
ruled
upon
the
issue
and
have
stated
the
issue
to
be
a
lack
of
statutory
authority
that
was
expressly
the
trial
court's
ruling
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
denied
the
petition
expressly
because
the
u.s.
supreme
court
had
not
intimidated
that
a
person
convicted
of
a
quasi-crime
or
a
petty
offense
could
get
an
appeal
by
case-made.
now,
the
issue
of
quasi
crime
which
was
briefed
well
in
the
court
below
as
apparently
been
abandoned
by
respondents
and
i'll
submit
it
on
my
third
argument
in
my
brief
covers
quasi
crime
to
think
it's
clear
there
is
no
quasi
crime,
that's
relevant
in
this
case.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
that's
correct.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
that's
the
maximum
under
the
city
ordinance.
right.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
that
turns
to
the
issue
of
the
petty
offense
your
honor
and
the
short
answer
is
yes.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
and
this
is
why.
because
our
contention
is
that
this
is
a
serious
crime.
there
are
as
your
honor
is
well
aware
in
this
discussions,
petty-serious
crimes,
there
are
two
elements.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
well,
the
--
usually,
the
past
determination
of
whether
it's
serious
or
petty
has
come
from
the
type
of
penalty
and
the
type
of
crime
but
we
think
it
goes
deeper
than
that.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
most
of
the
cases
do
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
no,
most
of
the
cases
--
most
of
the
cases
involving
the
petty-serious
distinction
have
been
jury
trial
issues.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
and
i
think
there
had
been
one
or
two
cases
involving
the
right
to
counsel.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
under
that
impression
your
honor,
i
can't
cite
you
one
right
now.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
no.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
well
no,
your
honor,
i
don't.
and
this
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
we
believe
that
in
serious
crime,
and
that's
why
we
think
the
right
to
counsel
is
important.
if
this
is
a
petty
crime,
possibly
we
wouldn't
have
a
right
to
counsel.
but
it's
a
serious
crime
and
since
it's
a
serious
crime,
we
have
a
right
to
a
fair
jury
trial
including
the
right
to
counsel,
a
fair
preliminary
hearing
and
a
fair
appellate
procedure
and
it's
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
without
counsel
would
be
half
a
loaf.
and
in
this
case,
there
had
been
no
oklahoma
cases
cited
to
this
court
in
which
the
court
said
that
this
situation
is
a
petty
offense.
so
turning
the
court
to
the
case
of
duncan
versus
louisiana
for
example
as
a
guide,
this
court
said
that
if
we
look
to
the
laws
of
the
locality
as
a
gauge
of
the
social
and
ethical
judgments,
we
see
that
the
crime
in
this
case
is
serious
for
the
singular
reason
that
for
50
years,
for
50
years,
the
state
of
oklahoma
has
given
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
based
upon
due
process
and
that
in
all
cases
in
which
there
is
any
incarceration,
in
all
cases
in
which
there's
any
incarceration,
the
oklahoma
courts
have
held
that
due
process
requires
a
jury
trial.
and
for
instance
franks
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
yes
sir,
even
for
one
day.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
well,
settled
to
oklahoma
constitutional
law
and
oklahoma
case
law
based
upon
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
yes
sir,
the
court
certainly
has.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
yes,
sir.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
no.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
no
sir,
we
concede
the
fact
that
there
is
at
some
place
a
petty
offense
but
this
court
need
not
re-examine
the
roots
of
the
petty-serious
offense
distinction
because
in
this
case,
it's
a
serious
crime.
it's
a
serious
crime
because
oklahoma
has
always
construed
this
type
of
crime
to
be
a
serious
offense.
did
that
answer
your
honor's
question?
mr.
jon
f.
gray
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
duncan
case,
you
implied
that
if
the
punishment
was
under
six
months,
there
would
be
no
right
to
a
jury
trial.
but
we
think
that
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
right.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
no,
your
honor.
it
was
my
reading
of
the
cases.
the
sixth
month
--
the
sixth-month
line
is
result
of
finding
that
as
i
understand
that
under
six
months,
it's
not
serious
and
over
six
months
it
is
serious
but
we'll
argue
that
there
are
more
considerations
than
the
mere
six-month
penalty.
your
honor
knows
well
that
there's
long
been
discussed,
there
are
two
elements,
the
length
of
the
penalty
as
well
as
the
seriousness
of
the
crime.
and
in
the
oklahoma
court
and
other
cases
cited
in
our
brief
in
pages
17
and
pages
28.
for
example
in
1918,
franks
versus
muskogee
gets
to
the
point
when
a
defendant
is
convicted
of
an
offense
carrying
a
maximum
offense,
a
$25.00
fine
is
the
maximum
penalty
and
this
court
held,
i
mean
the
oklahoma
court
held
that
in
any
regard
to
ordinance
violations,
any
crime
in
which
carries
imprisonment
is
an
essential
part
of
the
tribunal
and
in
this
case
that
i'm
mentioning
to
you,
the
defendant
could
be
jailed
for
failing
to
pay
a
fine
which
emphasizes
my
point
that
if
there's
one
day
of
imprisonment,
in
oklahoma
that's
a
serious
crime.
ex
parte
monroe
also
pointed
out.
it's
another
oklahoma
case
cited
in
our
brief,
that
it
was
never
contemplated
that
a
police
court
which
is
not
a
court
of
record
could
try
crimes
involving
incarceration.
now,
there
are
precedents
in
this
court,
callan
versus
wilson,
was
$25.00
fine
and
a
30-day
imprisonment
penalty
and
in
1888,
this
court
held
that
was
serious.
in
the
case
of
district
of
columbia
versus
colts,
the
charge
is
reckless
driving
which
we
think
to
be
a
lesser
including
offense
and
the
court
held
that
that
was
indictable
under
the
common
law.
it
was
shocking
to
the
general
moral
sense
and
state
cases
have
since
continued
that
evaluation
of
the
charge
of
reckless
driving
to
be
a
serious
offense.
there
are
--
our
contention
is
that
in
deciding
whether
a
crime
is
serious
or
not,
there
are
other
legal
indicia
besides
the
length
of
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
we
believe
that
the
right
to
counsel
is
part
of
the
baggage
of
the
jury
trial.
i
don't
know
if
that
answers
your
question
and
i
submit
that
the
right
to
counsel
shouldn't
depend
upon
an
arbitrary
imprisonment,
a
time
of
imprisonment.
it
should
depend
upon
whether
the
crime
is
serious
or
not
and
in
the
past,
this
court
had
said
there
are
two
considerations.
we're
arguing
today
that
there
are
many
considerations
about
whether
a
crime
is
serious.
the
right
to
counsel
that
you're
speaking
of
is
extended
in
oklahoma
by
a
statute
and
oklahoma
state
constitution
as
i
mentioned
and
it's
an
essential
part
of
the
jury
trial
and
also
the
city
of
oklahoma
city
has
an
attorney
and
it
certainly
would
be
a
violation
of
due
process
and
equal
protection
we
contend
to
try
a
man
with
a
jury
trial
when
the
city
of
oklahoma
city
has
an
attorney
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
yes,
sir.
i
was
his
attorney
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
well,
we're
indicating
that
since
there
is
a
right
to
counsel
that
is
another
indication
of
the
seriousness
of
the
crime.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
i
think
that
is
the
correct
position.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
well,
i
see
what
you
mean,
your
honor.
i
think
this
court
need
not
get
that
point
but
i
think
you're
right.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
that's
correct.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
yes,
sir.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
the
case
in
which
the
jury
trial
has
required
and
given.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
yes
that
is
right.
it
is
required
but
even
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
that's
right,
in
our
cases
and
in
this
court.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
in
our
cases
and
in
this
court.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
no,
your
honor.
the
definition
of
the
serious
offense
we
contend
comes
from
the
old
oklahoma
case
that's
cited
in
our
brief
which
construed
the
due
process
clause
to
mean
that
any
crime
which
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
that's
right.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
for
jury
trial?
mr.
jon
f.
gray
the
limit
that
applies
to
this
case
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
--
is
anything
over
a
$20.00
fine
or
any
imprisonment.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
right.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
that's
correct.
but
in
the
amendment,
they
have
left
the
imprisonment
requirement
if
there
is
still
any
imprisonment
if
the
serious
crime
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
no.
no,
it's
a
state
pending
this
appeal.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
yes,
90
days,
a
maximum
of
90
days
incarceration.
this
--
of
course
this
court
is
a
court
of
record
and
on
your
question
as
to
the
right
to
a
jury
trial,
our
position
is
that
since
we
do
have
a
right
to
a
jury
trial,
that
is
the
indication
of
seriousness
of
the
crime.
but
the
other
indication
as
to
which
we
submit
that
this
court
may
consider
are
the
seriousness,
serious
is
a
relative
term
and
should
be
related
to
something
other
than
some
other
length
of
punishment.
for
example,
a
$50.00
fine
given
to
a
wealthy
man
would
certainly
not
be
serious
but
given
to
a
man
earning
$50.00
a
week
and
supporting
11
children
is
serious.
now,
i
think
that's
a
proper
consideration.
there
are
other
gauges
of
social
and
ethical
judgments
of
the
locality
by
some
authors
have
termed
the
extra
legal
consequences
such
as
the
loss
of
job
or
for
example
if
a
school
teacher
were
given
a
three-month
jail
term
wrongfully,
that
would
be
a
serious
offense.
so
we
think
this
court
or
any
court
need
not
stop
just
as
the
penalty
of
the
three-month,
whether
it
be
three
months
or
six
months
to
look
at
the
seriousness
of
the
crime.
it
is
interesting
that
in
the
duncan
versus
louisiana
case,
the
state
level
was
two
years
and
that
was
the
level
of
which
we're
being
attacked
whereas
the
federal
level
is
six
months.
in
this
case,
the
state
level
is
any
imprisonment
and
in
the
duncan
case,
they
were
asking
this
court
to
improve
the
individual
protections
and
bring
it
down
to
the
federal
level.
in
this
case,
we're
asking
to
prove
the
individual
protections
by
leaving
the
dividing
lines
where
it
is
in
oklahoma
at
any
imprisonment.
so
we
asked
this
court
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
right.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
right
and
a
court
reporter.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
in
this
particular
court.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
imprisonment,
that's
correct.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
the
municipal
criminal
court
is
a
city
court
of
record
established
especially
by
statute
and
all
of
the
statutes
which
regard
its
procedure
are
set
out
in
a
special
section
separate
from
the
statute.
mr.
jon
f.
gray
no
it
is
just
in
oklahoma
city.
there
are
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
right.
the
--
in
19
--
mr.
jon
f.
gray
yes,
your
honor,
that's
essentially
correct.
in
other
counties,
there
are
county
courts
except
that
in
1968,
we
had
a
constitutional
revision
and
the
laws
were
changed
but
it
doesn't
affect
this
case
because
the
