justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
witnesses?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
took
a
whole
day?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
goes
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
goes
for
all
traffic
violations?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
ratcliffe,
as
i
read
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
they
didn't
touch
this
at
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
it
argued
to
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
don't
you
think
if
there
was
a
procedure
in
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
would
you
suggest
that
they
would
have
mentioned
in
their
opinion?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
went
on
the
merits
and
said
that
simply
because
this
was
an
ordinance
and
not
statute,
you
didn't
get
it,
period.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
it
had
been
the
statute
and
the
man
had
been
given
90
days,
there
would
have
been?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that's
the
only
point
that
they
decided.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
support
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
support
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
the
magic
difference
between
the
violation
of
an
ordinance
--
well
let
me
first
ask,
does
he
go
to
the
same
jail?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
goes
to
a
city
jail?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
has
served
90
days?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
he
goes
to
the
city
jail
and
served
90
days
and
he's
a
pauper,
no
appeal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
he's
sentenced
by
a
state
statute,
he
goes
to
the
state
jail
for
90
days,
he
gets
a
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
said
that's
alright?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
would
the
--
would
you
have
answered
that
in
the
brief
if
they
have
prepared
a
narrative
out
of
their
mind,
would
you
have
answered
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
mean
when
the
argument
came
up
in
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
would
you
have
had
the
transcript
to
work
on?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
other
side
wouldn't?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
don't
see
anything
wrong
with
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
