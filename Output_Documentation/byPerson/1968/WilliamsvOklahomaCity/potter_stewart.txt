justice
potter
stewart
you
said
statute,
it's
in
the
appendix
of
your
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
this
many,
i
have
a
little
trouble
finding
it.
i'm
not
being
critical
it's
a
very
thorough
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
top
of
page
39,
case-made
in
criminal
cases.
justice
potter
stewart
you
just
have
this
single
offense
in
your
statement.
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
have
the
two.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
a
question
asked
to
whether
or
not
he
was
an
indigent,
as
i
remember.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
petition
for
certiorari
pending
here.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask
this,
this
is
from
the
what,
the
municipal
court
or
the
municipal
criminal
court
as
called?
justice
potter
stewart
and
does
this
mean
that
there
always
is
a
court
reporter
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
sitting
there,
taking
down
the
--
transcribing
the
evidence?
justice
potter
stewart
and
here
she
is
paid
out
of
public
funds?
justice
potter
stewart
so
this
isn't
a
question
of
one
party
or
the
other
needing
to
arrange
in
advance
and
hire
a
reporter
to
come
into
the
courtroom?
justice
potter
stewart
per
copy.
justice
potter
stewart
this
man
received
a
sentence
of
90
days
imprisonment
and
a
$50.00
fine.
justice
potter
stewart
what's
the
90
days,
that's
the
maximum
under
this?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
said
there's
a
right
to
counsel
in
every
case
in
oklahoma
or
did
i
misunderstand
you?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
oklahoma,
every
serious
offense
is
a
serious
crime
under
that
definition
even
a
parking
offense.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
for
your
oral
argument
at
least.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
dividing
line
for
trial
by
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
and
also
for
the
right
to
appointed
counsel
if
you're
an
indigent?
justice
potter
stewart
and
a
court
reporter?
justice
potter
stewart
right
and
the
dividing
line
is
whether
or
not
it
can
possibly
be
punished
upon
conviction
by
imprisonment.
justice
potter
stewart
what's
the
jurisdiction
in
this

stewart
that's
the
court
had
no
--
the
court
has
no
jurisdiction
of
anything
punishable
with
a
more
serious
offense.
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
answer
to
justice
black's
question
now,
not
the
last
couple
of
years,
where
is
the

is
the
