mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
mr.
chief
justice,
if
your
honor
please.
the
respondents
have
urged
two
positions
here.
one
is
that
the
court's
ruling
in
the
griffin
case
should
not
be
extended
to
this
type
of
case
for
the
reason
that
the
relief
that
the
petitioners
have
sought
was
denied
by
the
appellate
court
below
on
the
grounds
that
this
was
a
quasi
criminal
in
the
language
of
the
court
are
a
petty
offense.
now,
i
think
this
is
what
we've
got
into
this
discussion
of
serious
offense
or
petty
offense.
the
court
just
said
that
it
had
reviewed
your
honor's
decisions
on
these
matters
and
had
found
no
case
where
this
court
has
said
that
a
transcript
must
be
furnished
in
a
case
involving
what
they
call
quasi
criminal
or
a
petty
offense.
now,
clearly
if
this
were
one
in
which
a
felony
was
involved,
it
would
not
be
tried
in
this
city
court.
consequently,
this
problem
wouldn't
have
arose.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
$100.00
fine,
90
days
maximum
sentence.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
no,
that's
true.
these
are
city
ordinances
only.
that's
all
they
find
in
your
city
ordinance.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
well,
this
court
that
we're
dealing
with
now
has
only
been
in
existence
two
or
three
years.
prior
to
that
time,
we
had
what
we
call
the
police
court
where
the
maximum
fine
was
$20.00.
the
appeal
from
there
was
to
the
common
plea
court
where
it
was
trial
de
novo.
then
of
course
an
appeal
from
that
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
would
be
treated
as
a
county
matter.
transcripts
would
have
been
furnished
under
the
state
law
and
say
this
problem
didn't
arise
until
just
a
couple
of
years.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
it
is
directed
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
just
as
it
was
before
from
the
court
of
common
plea.
in
other
words,
this
is
--
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
yes,
sir.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
well,
both
now.
both,
the
city
court
of
record
has
the
jury.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
yes.
and
then
from
that
court,
you
appeal
directly
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
no,
no,
no.
it's
tried
their
jury
--
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
yes.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
in
this
court.
they're
entitled
to
jury
trial.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
no
sir,
i
don't
agree
with
that.
however,
i
can't
--
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
i
can't
quote
you
any
cases
where
this
has
been
done.
however,
in
his
--
in
the
hearing
before
the
trial
court,
he
on
his
motion
for
a
free
case-made,
the
transcript,
a
copy
of
it
attached
to
our
brief
in
opposition
to
the
certiorari,
he
alleged
that
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
have
the
testimony
of
the
three
city
witnesses,
the
testimony
of
the
defendant
and
he
needed
to
present
some
additional
evidence
by
way
of
affidavit
which
has
been
made
a
part
of
this
record
in
the
last
week
or
so.
now,
clearly,
he
could
not
complete
his
case-made
if
he
just
took
the
reporter's
transcript
because
the
two
affidavits
and
the
--
well,
the
three
affidavits
that
he
has
acquired,
these
people
did
not
testify
in
court.
those
were
attached
to
his
motion
for
new
trial.
so
if
the
court
had
said
yes,
you
can
have
a
case-made.
part
of
his
transcript
would
have
to
have
been
in
narrative
form
because
these
people
did
not
testify
in
the
trial
--
in
the
case
at
trial
court.
the
reporter
could
not
have
been
included
it
in
the
case-made,
so
if
he
can
present
his
case
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
on
a
partial
reporter's
transcript,
on
a
partial
narrative
statement
of
evidence
by
way
of
affidavit,
we
don't
think
that
he
would
be
prejudiced
by
presenting
at
all.
now
this
was
not
a
complicated
case.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
i
can't
quote
you
where
this
has
been
done
your
honor.
but
i
believe
that
it
can
be.
i
believe
that
the
court,
the
petitioner's
attorney
or
the
attorney
for
the
city
or
anyone
who
could
had
the
information
available
could
sit
down
and
prepare
a
narrative
form,
a
statement
of
the
testimony
of
these
witnesses
and
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
would
consider
that.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
as
far
as
i
know,
it
has
not
been
done.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
no,
i
have
no
authority
where
it
could
be
not.
however,
i
have
quoted
a
case.
it's
an
old
oklahoma
case.
it's
harris
versus
state
in
which
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
had
this
to
say,
if
for
any
reason
stenographer's
notes
could
not
be
obtained,
then
it
was
the
duty
of
such
lawyers
to
use
their
best
exertion
to
make
up
the
case-made
from
memory
and
if
they
failed
to
do
so,
the
defendant
would
be
held
responsible
for
this
neglect
of
duty
on
their
part.
see
also
dove
versus
state,
the
writer
of
this
opinion
practice
law
many
years
in
texas
before
court
stenographers
were
known
to
that
state
and
when
the
law
--
when
it
went
under
the
law,
the
evidence
had
to
be
written
out
as
a
matter
of
memory
by
the
attorneys
and
filed
in
court
within
ten
days
from
the
adjournment
of
the
term
of
court.
the
writer
never
had
the
least
difficulty
in
preparing
his
statements
of
the
evidences
in
his
cases.
and
he
knows
from
personal
experience
that
it
can
easily
be
done.
in
fact,
he
seriously
doubts
that
the
employment
of
court
stenographers
is
at
all
necessary
either
in
the
administration
of
justice
up
to
the
development
of
lawyers.
it
has
a
tendency
to
breed
carelessness
on
their
part
but
be
that
as
it
may,
the
trial
court
has
a
large
discretion
as
to
when
to
order
the
stenographer's
note
be
extended
without
expense
to
the
defendant.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
mr.
justice
--
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
afternoon,
inquiry
was
made
i
believe
by
justice
white
relative
to
the
significance
of
some
language
in
the
trial
court's
order
pertaining
to
the
inability
of
the
defendant
or
his
counsel
to
prepare
a
transcript
from
memory.
the
reason
for
this
is
the
courts
in
oklahoma
have
set
this
as
one
of
the
prerequisites
for
furnishing
a
free
case-made
and
we
think
that
it's
significant
for
the
reason
that
by
implication
it
indicate
that
for
this
requirement
to
have
any
relevance,
it
must
mean
that
if
the
defendant
or
his
counsel
could
prepare
a
transcript
that
the
court
would
consider
it.
we'd
like
to
further
remind
the
court
that
part
of
this
record
has
already
been
transcribed.
that
three
of
the
witnesses
that
petitioner
maintains
or
material
had
--
their
testimony
has
already
been
prepared
in
narrative
form,
that
the
only
testimony
needed
were
the
three
witnesses
that
testified
in
behalf
of
the
city
and
the
defendant
and
we
believe
that
this
could
be
prepared
in
narrative
form
and
we
think
that
the
courts,
that
the
appellate
court
below
would
consider
it
in
that
fashion.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
no
sir,
they
did
not.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
i
wasn't
in
that
proceeding
in
that
time
and
i
don't
know
but
it
did
not
go
to
that.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
well,
i'd
like
to
think
that
they
did.
they
would
have
but
if
the
question
was
not
put
to
them
i
just
don't
know
whether
they
would
consider
it
or
not.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
yes.
that
in
as
much
of
this
was
a
violation
of
municipal
ordinance
that
there
was
no
statutory
authority
for
it
--
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
the
state
law
authorizes
the
furnishing
of
case-mades
in
those
cases
that
are
tried
in
the
county
and
the
district
courts.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
yes.
however,
we
can
--
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
sir?
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
yes.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
well,
i
believe
that
--
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
no,
sir.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
yes,
sir.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
yes,
sir.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
well,
--
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
that's
correct.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
well,
i
say
that
in
this
particular
case,
that
there's
been
no
need
or
necessity
shown
that
he
have
a
reporter's
stenographic
copy
of
the
record,
that
this
was
a
case
that
was
tried
in
less
than
a
day,
that
it
was
not
particularly
complicated
case,
that
there
were
just
four
witnesses,
that
this
testimony
could
have
been
prepared
in
narrative
form
and
submitted
to
the
court.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
well,
i
think
we've
been
given
opportunity
to
approve
it.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
if
we
have
ordered
one,
yes.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
well,
no.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
well,
i
don't
know
why
there
would
be
any
necessity
for
us
to
have
a
transcript
if
we
could
stipulate
and
agree
and
approve
on
the
narrative
form
statement
of
the
issues.
and
as
i
say,
i
can't
cite
you
any
cases
where
oklahoma
has
held
that
they
would
consider
it
this
way
but
by
implication,
i
think
that
it's
there,
that
it
could
be.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
mr.
chief
justice,
if
your
honor
please.
the
respondents
have
urged
two
positions
here.
one
is
that
the
court's
ruling
in
the
griffin
case
should
not
be
extended
to
this
type
of
case
for
the
reason
that
the
relief
that
the
petitioners
have
sought
was
denied
by
the
appellate
court
below
on
the
grounds
that
this
was
a
quasi
criminal
in
the
language
of
the
court
are
a
petty
offense.
now,
i
think
this
is
what
we've
got
into
this
discussion
of
serious
offense
or
petty
offense.
the
court
just
said
that
it
had
reviewed
your
honor's
decisions
on
these
matters
and
had
found
no
case
where
this
court
has
said
that
a
transcript
must
be
furnished
in
a
case
involving
what
they
call
quasi
criminal
or
a
petty
offense.
now,
clearly
if
this
were
one
in
which
a
felony
was
involved,
it
would
not
be
tried
in
this
city
court.
consequently,
this
problem
wouldn't
have
arose.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
$100.00
fine,
90
days
maximum
sentence.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
no,
that's
true.
these
are
city
ordinances
only.
that's
all
they
find
in
your
city
ordinance.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
well,
this
court
that
we're
dealing
with
now
has
only
been
in
existence
two
or
three
years.
prior
to
that
time,
we
had
what
we
call
the
police
court
where
the
maximum
fine
was
$20.00.
the
appeal
from
there
was
to
the
common
plea
court
where
it
was
trial
de
novo.
then
of
course
an
appeal
from
that
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
would
be
treated
as
a
county
matter.
transcripts
would
have
been
furnished
under
the
state
law
and
say
this
problem
didn't
arise
until
just
a
couple
of
years.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
it
is
directed
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
just
as
it
was
before
from
the
court
of
common
plea.
in
other
words,
this
is
--
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
yes,
sir.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
well,
both
now.
both,
the
city
court
of
record
has
the
jury.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
yes.
and
then
from
that
court,
you
appeal
directly
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
no,
no,
no.
it's
tried
their
jury
--
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
yes.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
in
this
court.
they're
entitled
to
jury
trial.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
no
sir,
i
don't
agree
with
that.
however,
i
can't
--
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
i
can't
quote
you
any
cases
where
this
has
been
done.
however,
in
his
--
in
the
hearing
before
the
trial
court,
he
on
his
motion
for
a
free
case-made,
the
transcript,
a
copy
of
it
attached
to
our
brief
in
opposition
to
the
certiorari,
he
alleged
that
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
have
the
testimony
of
the
three
city
witnesses,
the
testimony
of
the
defendant
and
he
needed
to
present
some
additional
evidence
by
way
of
affidavit
which
has
been
made
a
part
of
this
record
in
the
last
week
or
so.
now,
clearly,
he
could
not
complete
his
case-made
if
he
just
took
the
reporter's
transcript
because
the
two
affidavits
and
the
--
well,
the
three
affidavits
that
he
has
acquired,
these
people
did
not
testify
in
court.
those
were
attached
to
his
motion
for
new
trial.
so
if
the
court
had
said
yes,
you
can
have
a
case-made.
part
of
his
transcript
would
have
to
have
been
in
narrative
form
because
these
people
did
not
testify
in
the
trial
--
in
the
case
at
trial
court.
the
reporter
could
not
have
been
included
it
in
the
case-made,
so
if
he
can
present
his
case
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
on
a
partial
reporter's
transcript,
on
a
partial
narrative
statement
of
evidence
by
way
of
affidavit,
we
don't
think
that
he
would
be
prejudiced
by
presenting
at
all.
now
this
was
not
a
complicated
case.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
i
can't
quote
you
where
this
has
been
done
your
honor.
but
i
believe
that
it
can
be.
i
believe
that
the
court,
the
petitioner's
attorney
or
the
attorney
for
the
city
or
anyone
who
could
had
the
information
available
could
sit
down
and
prepare
a
narrative
form,
a
statement
of
the
testimony
of
these
witnesses
and
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
would
consider
that.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
as
far
as
i
know,
it
has
not
been
done.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
no,
i
have
no
authority
where
it
could
be
not.
however,
i
have
quoted
a
case.
it's
an
old
oklahoma
case.
it's
harris
versus
state
in
which
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
had
this
to
say,
if
for
any
reason
stenographer's
notes
could
not
be
obtained,
then
it
was
the
duty
of
such
lawyers
to
use
their
best
exertion
to
make
up
the
case-made
from
memory
and
if
they
failed
to
do
so,
the
defendant
would
be
held
responsible
for
this
neglect
of
duty
on
their
part.
see
also
dove
versus
state,
the
writer
of
this
opinion
practice
law
many
years
in
texas
before
court
stenographers
were
known
to
that
state
and
when
the
law
--
when
it
went
under
the
law,
the
evidence
had
to
be
written
out
as
a
matter
of
memory
by
the
attorneys
and
filed
in
court
within
ten
days
from
the
adjournment
of
the
term
of
court.
the
writer
never
had
the
least
difficulty
in
preparing
his
statements
of
the
evidences
in
his
cases.
and
he
knows
from
personal
experience
that
it
can
easily
be
done.
in
fact,
he
seriously
doubts
that
the
employment
of
court
stenographers
is
at
all
necessary
either
in
the
administration
of
justice
up
to
the
development
of
lawyers.
it
has
a
tendency
to
breed
carelessness
on
their
part
but
be
that
as
it
may,
the
trial
court
has
a
large
discretion
as
to
when
to
order
the
stenographer's
note
be
extended
without
expense
to
the
defendant.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
mr.
justice
--
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
afternoon,
inquiry
was
made
i
believe
by
justice
white
relative
to
the
significance
of
some
language
in
the
trial
court's
order
pertaining
to
the
inability
of
the
defendant
or
his
counsel
to
prepare
a
transcript
from
memory.
the
reason
for
this
is
the
courts
in
oklahoma
have
set
this
as
one
of
the
prerequisites
for
furnishing
a
free
case-made
and
we
think
that
it's
significant
for
the
reason
that
by
implication
it
indicate
that
for
this
requirement
to
have
any
relevance,
it
must
mean
that
if
the
defendant
or
his
counsel
could
prepare
a
transcript
that
the
court
would
consider
it.
we'd
like
to
further
remind
the
court
that
part
of
this
record
has
already
been
transcribed.
that
three
of
the
witnesses
that
petitioner
maintains
or
material
had
--
their
testimony
has
already
been
prepared
in
narrative
form,
that
the
only
testimony
needed
were
the
three
witnesses
that
testified
in
behalf
of
the
city
and
the
defendant
and
we
believe
that
this
could
be
prepared
in
narrative
form
and
we
think
that
the
courts,
that
the
appellate
court
below
would
consider
it
in
that
fashion.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
no
sir,
they
did
not.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
i
wasn't
in
that
proceeding
in
that
time
and
i
don't
know
but
it
did
not
go
to
that.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
well,
i'd
like
to
think
that
they
did.
they
would
have
but
if
the
question
was
not
put
to
them
i
just
don't
know
whether
they
would
consider
it
or
not.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
yes.
that
in
as
much
of
this
was
a
violation
of
municipal
ordinance
that
there
was
no
statutory
authority
for
it
--
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
the
state
law
authorizes
the
furnishing
of
case-mades
in
those
cases
that
are
tried
in
the
county
and
the
district
courts.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
yes.
however,
we
can
--
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
sir?
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
yes.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
well,
i
believe
that
--
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
no,
sir.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
yes,
sir.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
yes,
sir.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
well,
--
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
that's
correct.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
well,
i
say
that
in
this
particular
case,
that
there's
been
no
need
or
necessity
shown
that
he
have
a
reporter's
stenographic
copy
of
the
record,
that
this
was
a
case
that
was
tried
in
less
than
a
day,
that
it
was
not
particularly
complicated
case,
that
there
were
just
four
witnesses,
that
this
testimony
could
have
been
prepared
in
narrative
form
and
submitted
to
the
court.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
well,
i
think
we've
been
given
opportunity
to
approve
it.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
if
we
have
ordered
one,
yes.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
well,
no.
mr.
giles
k.
ratcliffe
well,
i
don't
know
why
there
would
be
any
necessity
for
us
to
have
a
transcript
if
we
could
stipulate
and
agree
and
approve
on
the
narrative
form
statement
of
the
issues.
and
as
i
say,
i
can't
cite
you
any
cases
where
oklahoma
has
held
that
they
would
consider
it
this
way
but
by
implication,
i
think
that
it's
there,
that
it
could
be.
thank
you,
sir.
