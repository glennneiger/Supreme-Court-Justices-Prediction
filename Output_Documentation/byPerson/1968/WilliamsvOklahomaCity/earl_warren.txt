mr.
gray,
you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
a
legal
distinction
between
drunk-driving
and
driving
under
the
influence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
what
is
the
legal
difference
between
the
two?
you
said,
you
know
what
drunk-driving
is
but
this
is
something
different,
then
it's
something
different.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
long
did
the
trial
take?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
short
would
it
have
to
be
so
memory
would
suffice?
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
forward?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
don't
some
states
have
this
as
a
regular
procedure
where
the
defense
counsel
presents
a
statement
of
the
fact
on
appeal
and
it's
settled
by
the
court
after
a
consultation
with
counsel?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
such
a
procedure.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
do
they
have?
chief
justice
earl
warren
those
were
the
only
two?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
is
no
provision
at
all
for
counsel
getting
together
and
presenting
a
statement
of
the
facts
to
the
court
and
have
it
approved
and
used
as
a
record
on
appeal.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
there
any
cases
in
oklahoma
where
a
trial
record
has
been
made
by
counsel
and
approved
by
the
court
and
used
by
the
courts
of
appeal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there's
a
trial
de
novo
in
the
district
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
ratcliffe.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
agree
with
mr.
gray
to
the
effect
that
there
is
no
other
way
that
this
indigent
client
can
have
appeal
on
the
record,
on
the
evidence
other
than
to
have
a
case-made
by
the
stenographer
at
his
own
expense?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
isn't
exactly
my
question.
what
my
question
was,
is
there
in
the
power
of
the
court
to
make
any
kind
of
a
record
that
would
enable
him
to
appeal
on
the
evidence
in
his
case
other
than
by
a
case-made
paid
by
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
done
as
a
matter
of
practice?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
have
any
authority
to
the
effect
that
it
can
be
done?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
