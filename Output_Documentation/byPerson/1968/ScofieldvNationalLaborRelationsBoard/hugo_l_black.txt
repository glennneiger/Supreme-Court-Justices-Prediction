you

justice
hugo
l.
black
you
raised
it
in
your
brief
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
judge
you're
inclined
to
present
a
[inaudible]
defense
in
favor
of
your
jurisdiction
or
objection?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
want
to
be
clear
about
what
the
real
issue
here?
you
say
a
reasonable
discipline?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand
that
here
what
has
been
done
is
that
workers
have
worked,
they
worked
a
number
of
hours
they
were
supposed
to
work,
they
did
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
produced
more
than
a
minimum,
more
than
a
what
was
supposed
to
be
produced
and
take
pay
for
and
that
they
are
being
barred
from
union
membership.
is
that
the
reasonable
discipline
that's
indicated,
or
discharged,
removed
from
the
membership
i
don't
mean
barred,
i
mean
that
would
amount
for
the
same
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
does
that
not
get
down
to
--
i
am
not
saying
it
does
or
it
doesn't
because
frankly
i
am
little
concealed,
but
does
that
not
get
down
to
this
that
they
are
required
not
to
produce
so
much
as
they
can
during
the
time
of
the
work
on
the
penalty
that
if
they
do
produce
as
much
as
they
can
and
they
take
pay
for
it
that
the
union
can
remove
them
from
membership?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
they
defer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
the
company
want
to
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
wouldn't
make
a
contract.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
isn't
that
susceptible
of
being
called
an
arrangement
or
whatever
it
is
to
induce
the
employee
to
hold
up
his
work
and
not
give
as
much
for
this
job
as
he
should?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
then
there
is
a
question
of
whether
he
should
be
allowed
to
bargain
with
the
employer
that
in
a
way
that
would
force
the
employer
to
pay
for
what
my
brother
here,
i
think,
pointed
to
,
something
like
featherbedding.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
don't
i'll
--
forget
that
word,
it
sounds
like
what
as
they
all,
there's
always
been
a
inclination
as
i
understand,
it
maybe
right,
part
of
the
union,
not
to
want
(inaudible)
they
can
produce
a
lot,
do
a
lot
in
the
short
term.
in
the
old
days,
pick
more
cotton
in
the
day
than
your
brother,
not
to
want
them
to
do
that
and
get
paid
for
it,
but
they
want
to
have
a
organization
where
they
can
hold
them
back
and
they
can
take
the
average
man
got
paid.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
avoided
that,
didn't
they,
simply
by
putting
it
on
a
piece
rate
and
then
accomplishing
the
same
purpose
by
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
weren't
they
really
bargaining
at
all
that
whether
the
employee
would
do
all
he
could
and
just
--
what
degree
of,
percentage
of
his
ability
he
should
carry
out
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
let
me
ask
just
one
question
and
my
last
one.
if
that
is
not
the
purpose
of
such
an
agreement,
what
is?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this
other
question?
justice
hugo

if
i
can
interrupt
you
just
one
second,
i
know
it
bothers
you.
but
it
seems
to
me
you
have
admitted
that,
that
is
the
purpose
by
talking
and
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
makes
your
position
wrong
by
saying
that
the
older
men
might
have
to
work
more
than
they
had
to
--
would
have
been
to
work
otherwise?
justice
hugo
l.

all
right,
that's
when
you're
done
it
protects,
i
don't
want
you
to
defend
that
position
instead
of
saying
that's
not
the
reason?
justice

you
have
to

it
legally.
