that's
what
it
speaks
here
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
under
the
new
rule
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
no
question
[inaudible]
in
this
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
no
that's
all
right.
mr.
silard
though,
that's
not
quite
it
i
think.
you
know,
because
my
question
to
you
is
whether
--
let
us
take
a
case
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
provides
for
an
eight-hour
day.
and
then,
i
posed
a
question
of
what
be
the
result
if
the
union
sought
to
enforce
a
rule,
a
union
rule
saying
that
in
those
eight
hours
you
might
produce
only
x
number
of
units?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
--
all
right
take
it
both
ways.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
in
this
case
we
use
–
what
your
point
is
that
situation
is
salvaged,
because
the
company
and
the
union
agreed
that
the
ceiling
here
defines
a
fair
day's
output?
justice
john
m.
harlan
because
of
agreement,
you
don't
want
us
to
go
to
find
that
it's
fair
day's
output,
do
you?
you
are
not
asking
us
to
do
that,
are
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
alright.
now
suppose
that
--
take
the
case
that
i
put
to
you
and
let's
suppose
that
there
is
an
eight-hour
day
and
let's
suppose
that
the
union
says
that
you
may
produce
only
five
units.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now
let's
suppose
that's
not
a
fair
day's
work
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes
i
understand.
let
me
give
a
case
number
two
mr.
silard.
let's
suppose
that
this
is
a
fair
average.
the
record
shows
it's
a
fair
average,
but
the
company
says
about
one
half
of
our
men
could
produce
more
than
this
if
they
weren't
restricted
by
this
arbitrary
union
rule?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
about
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so,
what
you're
really
basing
this
on
and
let's
--
what
i
want
to
get
clear
from
you,
if
this
is
your
point,
what
you're
really
saying
is
that
your
case
depends
upon
company
and
union
agreement
or
acquiescence?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i've
gone
as
far
as
i
can,
i
think
in
my
questioning
of
you,
because
i
wanted
to
know
crisply
and
shortly
whether
your
position
depends
upon
company
agreement
or
company
acquiescence
or
it's
independent
of
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
it
speaks
here
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
under
the
new

[inaudible]
justice
john
m.

[inaudible]
justice

no

[inaudible]
in
this
case.

john
m.

no
that's
