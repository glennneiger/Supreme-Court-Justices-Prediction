justice
abe
fortas
mr.
urdan
may
i
see
if
i
understand
this,
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
established
or
there
was
established
pursuant
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
certain
ceilings
of
any
employee
who
produced
above
the
particular
ceiling
was
entitled
to
additional
pay,
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
a
flat
rate,
flat
rate
no
matter
how
much
he
produced
or
was
there
a
point
at
which
the
incentive
pay,
that
is
to
say
a
greater
rate
of
pay
was
due?
justice
abe
fortas
but
if
an
employee
reaches
a
certain
number
of
units,
is
he
entitled
to
incentive
pay
beginning
with
the
units
at
that
point?
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
to
say
there
is
a
guarantee
and
i
assume
that
that
guarantee
is
equal
to
the
per
unit
rate
times
a
certain
number
of
units,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
sir
that
but
i'm
trying
to
get
an
answer
to
this
question
perhaps
i
am
--
i
must
be
asking
it
very
badly,
but
in
your
brief
i've
had
the
same
difficulty
with
your
brief
as
my
brother
stewart.
as
i
understand
that
there
is
a
ceiling
whether
it
set
forth
as
a
ceiling
or
not
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
that
ceiling
as
i
understand
it
from
what
you've
now
said
is
determined
by
taking
the
per
unit
wage
rate
and
dividing
that
into
the
guaranteed
minimum
wage,
a
guaranteed
wage
then
you
get
a
certain
number
of
units
and
over
and
above
that
the
employee
gets
additional
compensation
per
unit,
is
that
the
way
it
works
or
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
ceiling
the
same
as
the
minimum
guaranteed
wage?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
higher,
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
serious?
are
you
serious
that
any
employee
who
doesn't
want
or
earn
anymore
than
the
minimum
is
breaching
the
contract?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
isn't
what
the
contract
says,
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well
the
care
string
appears
though
whatever
it
may
be,
i
don't
know
we'd
say
something
suddenly
appears
and
somebody's
work
is
done,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well
then
are
you
suggesting
that
the
employer
doesn't
know
that
anyway?
justice
abe
fortas
is
this
a
sovereign
company,
is
this
a
sovereign
company
despite
that
kind
of
quaint
practice?
justice
abe
fortas
actually
you
are
saying
that
contrary,
aren't
you,
that
there
are
certain
rights
which
the
employee
would
have
regardless
of
what
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
provides
in
this
situation,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
abe
fortas
now
suppose
a
collective
bargaining
expressly,
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
employer
and
the
union
expressly
agreed
on
a
ceiling
that
an
employee
may
quit
and
go
home
and
then
it
provides
for
a
--
incentives
for
additional
production
thereafter,
and
then
it
provides
for
this
banking
arrangement,
just
exactly
what's
here.
if
that
were
clearly
a
part
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
would
you
still
say
that
the,
these
--
that
your
clients
have
a
cause
to
complain?
justice
abe
fortas
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
the
agreement
expressly
said
that
the
union,
that
pursuant
to
union
rules
employees
maybe
prohibited
from
working
more
than
enough
to
earn
the
base
pay?
justice
abe
fortas
what's
making
here
in
effect
is
saying
that
it's
a
part
of
the
agreement
they
are
saying
that
the
employer
acquiesced
in
it?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
difference
between
the
terms
of
the
order
entered
as
part
of
the
court's
opinion
on
march
5
and
the
decree
issued
on
april
16th?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
there
no
incentive
system
here,
suppose
that
all
you
had
was
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
providing
for
that
every
employee
shall
work
an
eight-hour
day
such
and
such
and
get
paid
such
and
such
an
amount.
and
then
the
union
made
what's
commonly
sometimes
referred
to
as
a
featherbedding
rule
and
said,
nobody
shall
produce
more
than
so
many
die
castings
or
whatever
it
is
per
day
and
then
the
union,
an
employee
violates
that
the
union
sues
to
collect
a
fine,
what
about
that?
in
other
words
is
your
position
totally
dependent
here
on
the
fact
that
this
is
a
piece
work
and
incentive
system
within
an
eight-day
framework,
eight-hour
day
framework.
suppose
it
was
just
an
eight-hour
day
collective
bargaining
agreement.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
you
would
concede
at
least
for
purposes
of
this
discussion
that
if
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
provides
only
for
a
certain
right
of
pay
for
an
eight-hour
day
then
it
gets
to
be
a
little
difficult,
doesn't
it,
to
arrive
at
--
to
distinguish
that
case
from
a
situation
where
--
from
this
situation.
that
is
to
say,
here
you
have
and
--
if
you
assume
that
this
contract
does
provide
for
an
eight-hour
day
and
if
you
would
assume
as
i
take
it
your
opponent
asks
us
to
that
the
eight-hour
day
provision
carries
with
it
the
implied
obligation
to
work
as
productively
as
reasonably
possible
during
those
eight
hours.
then
you
get
into
a
difficulty
of
distinguishing
those
two
cases
and
i
take
that
what
you
bring
into
play
then
to
distinguish
those
two
cases
is
the
fact
that
this
is
kind
of
a
half
this
and
half
that
contract.
it's
half
and
eight-hour
day
contract
and
half
a
piece
work
contract,
which
provides
for
a
level
of
acceptable
production
and
then
for
incentive
pay
over
that?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
want
to
leave
--
i
don't
want
to
leave
your
suggesting
stand,
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
really
how
you
would
distinguish
those
two
cases
because
to
my

that's
the
number

problem?
