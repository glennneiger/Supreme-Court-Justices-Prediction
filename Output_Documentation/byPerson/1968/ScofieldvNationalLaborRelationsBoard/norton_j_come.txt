mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court?
the
jurisdictional
point,
your
honor
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
we
believe
nonetheless
that
under
the
minneapolis
honeywell
decision
of
this
court
that
the
petition
was
untimely
filed
and
that
the
90-day
period
runs
from
the
date
of
the
march
5
order.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
we
were
not
served
with
a
copy
of
that
order,
that
is
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
i
admit
it
does
not
make
much
equity.
mr.
norton
j.
come
right
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
we
did.
we
raised
it
as
--
in
our
opposition
to
certiorari
that
was
one
of
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
we
did
your
honor.
we
raised
it
in
the
point
two
of
our
brief.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
quite
the
contrary.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
we
have,
we
have
raised
it.
mr.
norton
j.
come
all
i
know
is
that
we
have
gotten
the
cert
denied,
whether
that
was
the
reason
that
the
petition
was
denied
or
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
that
is
correct.
there's
never
been
an
authoritative
ruling
on
it,
however
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
in
some
circuits
it
is.
in
other
circuits
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
would
say
that
sometimes
we
are
and
sometimes
we're
not.
i
know
that
our
practice
is
not
to
take
a
chance.
we
always
count
our
time
from
the
date
of
the
court's
decision.
we'll
start
with
a
copy
of
the
court's
decision
and
we
have
found
from
practice
that
some
circuits
like
the
seventh
circuit
will
enter
an
order
or
judgment
the
same
day
that
they
enter
the
decision.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
usually
the
decree
is
entered
no
later
than
30
days
after
the
decision.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
the
new
federal
rules
of
appellant
procedure
which
have
taken
effect
subsequent
to
this
case
purport
to
have
a
uniform
provision
covering
this
situation.
however,
significantly
that
rule
talks
in
terms
of
an
order
enforcing,
the
administrative
order.
here
you
did
not
have
as
you
typically
have
whether
that's
an
enforcement
of
the
board's
order
or
an
enforcement
in
part,
any
possibility
that
a
subsequent
decree
might
raise
a
question
as
to
the
terms
of
the
prohibition
that
would
be
entered
because
all
that
the
court
did
here
was
to
affirm
the
board's
dismissal
of
the
complaint
and
no
decree
that
could
subsequently
be
entered,
would
there
be
likely,
there
would
be
any
question
as
to
what
the
terms
of
that
is
going
to
be.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
it
probably
would
be
although
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
it
probably
would
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
at
least
as
i
read
the
new
rule.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i'll
rest
on
the
presentation
i
made
your
honor.
i
do
think
though
that
we
ought
to
turn
to
the
facts
of
this
case
because
i
think
that
they
are
very
important
and
because
i
think
that
they're
somewhat
unusual.
now
on
the
facts
of
the
case,
as
found
by
the
board's
trial
examiner,
the
board,
and
is
sustained
by
the
seventh
circuit.
we
do
not
have
a
situation
that
my
colleague
has
been
positing
here.
what
we
do
have
here
is
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
operative
part
of
which
is
set
out
at
page
46
of
the
record.
it
simply
provides
the
jobs,
i'm
reading
from
paragraph
90,
section
(1),
shall
be
so
priced
as
a
result
of
a
time
study
that
the
average
competent
operator
working
at
a
reasonable
pace
shall
earn
not
less
than
the
machine
rate
of
his
assigned
task.
and
then
if
you
look
at
the
bottom
of
page
47,
you
see
that
these
were
classifications,
they
set
a
figure
called
a
machine
rate
for
grade
one
and
the
contract
goes
on,
there
are
five
different
classifications
with
different
machine
rates,
that
their
rate
as
a
lower
rate
that's
paid
under
a
certain
circumstances
and
is
not
irrelevant,
but
roughly
what
this
machine
rate
represents
is
this.
it
reflects
a
determination
on
the
basis
of
time
studies
of
the
number
of
pieces
of
work
that
an
average
operator
would
turn
out
in
an
hour
after
an
adjustment
for
such
factors
as
picking
up
and
cleaning
tools,
fatigue
and
personal
needs.
now
this
is
all
that
the
contract
establishes
here.
it
doesn't
have
a
provision
that
my
opponent
has
been
referring
to
that
an
employee
can
be
paid
for
turning
out
as
much
as
he
pleases
or
that
he
has
to
give
over
and
above
the
machine
rate
here
in
order
to
fulfill
his
obligation,
the
work
in
eight
hour
day.
now,
by
taking
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
the
--
there's
another
provision
of
the
contract
that
says
that
the
work
shift
is
from
certain
hour
to
the
certain
hours
and
that
accomplishes
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
he
still
must
stay
on
his
job
and
the
record
shows
that
they
do
stay
on
the
job,
that
the
time
that,
that
is
available
is
spent
usually
in
preparing
the
machines
for
the
next
day's
work
that,
although
there
has
been
occasionally
some
problem
with
too
much
talking,
or
card
playing,
or
other
things
of
that
sort
that
whenever
the
union
or
the
company
has
promulgated
rules
to
cut
that
out,
the,
it
has
stopped
and
that
the
union
stewards
have
cooperated
in
cutting
out
any
of
those
diversions.
in
addition
to
that,
the
allowances
that
have
been
worked
into,
in
for
fatigue
and
rest,
and
so
on
in
establishing
the
machine
rate,
the
evidence
in
the
record
shows
is
it
allows
for
the
equivalent
of
about
48
minutes,
which
the
employee
is
free
to
take
during
the
course
of
the
time.
so
if
he
prefers
to
take
that
at
the
end
of
the
8
hours
shift,
there's
nothing
in
the
contract
that
would
prevent
him
from
doing
so.
now
as
this
court
is
well
aware,
unions
have
traditionally
been
opposed
to
incentive
pay
systems
not
primary
for
the
featherbedding
reasons
that
my
opponent
has
indicated,
but
for
the
perfectly
legitimate
reasons
that
they
have
feared
that
this
could
result
in
employees
working
themselves
out
of
jobs
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i'm
going
to
come
to
that
in
a
moment
after
establishing
--
which
i
have
currently
do
not
have
to
belabor
that
you
cannot
say
that
a
limitation
on
incentive
earnings
is
something
that
is
illegal
on
its
face
or
horrendous.
it
serves
a
very
legitimate
interest
of
a
labor
union
and
of
its
members
and
i
might
add
as
justice
white
pointed
out
that
these
employees
here
were
longstanding
members
of
the
union.
one
of
them
had
been
a
member
for
at
least
17
years
and
had
been
a
union
steward
throughout
most
of
this
period.
although
there
was
a
union
security
arrangement
in
this
case
like
the
union
security
arrangement
in
allis-chalmers,
it
gave
the
employees
the
option
of
either
becoming
full-fledged
union
members
or
paying
only
a
service
fee,
and
all
of
the
four
plaintiffs
here
insofar
as
the
record
shows
opted
to
become
full-fledged
union
members
and
have
been
so
for
many
years.
now
since
at
least
1944,
the
union
here
has
by
membership
rule
placed
a
ceiling
on
the
amount
above
the
minimum
or
the
machine
rate
which
an
employee
member
may
claim
as
current
earnings.
now
the,
if
the
present,
the
time
of
this
hearing,
the
ceilings
were
about
$0.40
to
$0.50
an
hour
above
the
machine
rate.
they're
shown
at
page
50
of
the
record,
the
comparison
between
the
machine
rate
and
the
ceiling
rate.
now,
it's
important
to
emphasize
that
the
rule
as
it
has
been
consistently
interpreted
and
applied
does
not
preclude
the
employee
from
producing
in
excess
of
the
ceiling.
and
if
he
does,
the
extra
production
physically
enters
the
flow
of
company
operations.
the
rule
merely
requires
an
employee
to
forgo
demanding
immediate
compensation
under
the
banking
procedure
that
mr.
justice
brennan
referred
to
for
a
later
time,
when
the
receipt
of
the
earnings
would
be
less
likely
to
disrupt
employee
morale
and
working
conditions.
well,
for
example
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
there
are
times
when
the,
employee's
machine
is
down
due
to
a
breakdown
and
other
shortage
of
material
or
something
of
that
sort
now
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
under
the
--
in
those
circumstances
under
the
contract,
the
company
would
be
obligated
even
though
he
was
not
turning
out
any
production
to
either
at
the
machine
rate
or
at
the
lower
day
rate.
under
these
ceiling
banking
system,
the
employee
can
draw
on
the
earnings
that
he
has
accumulated
in
there
and
be
paid
at
the
ceiling
rate
and
the
company
has
co-operated
by
paying
him
at
such
a
rate.
moreover
it
has
furnished
the
production
cards
to
the
union
so
that
the
union
can
periodically
check
compliance
with
the
ceiling
and
further
more
it
pays
the
union
stewards
for
the
time
that
they
spend
in
checking
the
cards.
so
that
this
ceiling
system
as
it
operates
in
this
plant
could
not
possibly
operate
without
a
substantial
amount
of
employer
co-operation
and
acquiescence
and
indeed
that
was
the
finding
of
the
board
and
the
trial
examiner
and
the
court
below.
now
i
want
to
get
to
the
question
of
the
collective
bargaining.
the
ceiling
rule
to
be
sure
was
unilateral
in
origin.
if
we
go
back
to
1944
or
even
to
1938
actually
when
it
first
started
as
a
result
of
a
gentleman's
agreement
among
the
union
members.
however,
since
then
it
has
been
regularly
the
subject
of
collective
bargaining
between
the
employer
and
the
union
when
the
contracts
have
come
up
for
negotiation.
indeed
petitioners
concede
at
page
3
of
their
brief
that
the
ceilings
have
been
the
subject
of
collective
bargaining.
now
i'll
refer
you
to
the
findings
of
the
trial
examiner
on
page
68
of
the
record,
which
sets
forth
the
way
the
typical
negotiation
works,
the
reading
as
i
pass
through
here.
among
the
subjects
embraced
by
the
contract
negotiations,
is
the
setting
of
the
ceiling
rate.
and
skipping
down
a
bit
further
and
so
into
typical
negotiations,
the
employer
begins
by
asking
the
union
to
agree
to
eliminate
the
ceiling
and
as
the
second
alternative
proposes
a
raise
in
the
ceiling.
as
an
inducement
thereof,
it
may
offer
a
concession
in
a
form
of
a
raise
in
the
guaranteed
roe
machine
rate
and
the
raise
in
turn
conditions
be
extent
to
which
the
union
will
agree
to
raise
the
ceiling.
and
then
the
trial
examiner
concludes
at
the
bottom
of
69,
the
status
thus
achieved
by
the
ceiling
program
is
the
product
of
hard
bargaining.
and
this
is
reflected
even
in
some
of
the
written
agreements
that
the
parties
have
concluded.
for
instance,
the
1953
contract
which
is
not
reprinted
here,
but
is
in
general
counsel's
exhibit
17,
provided
specifically
that
the
previous
agreement
be
modified
to
increase
the
ceilings,
a
total
of
13
cents
per
hour.
in
the
1956
strike
settlement
agreement,
which
is
set
forth
in
the
record,
at
page
49
at
the
bottom
it
says
the
ceilings
on
earnings
is
to
be
raised
ten
cents
per
hour
above
the
general
increase
of
an
earlier
date.
and
as
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
i'd
have
a
much
tougher
case,
but
i
think
that
you
could
read
allis-chalmers,
which
i
think
is
what
we
come
down
to
the
standing
for
the
proposition
that
so
long
as
the
union
discipline
was
confined
to
fines
or
expulsion
that
did
not
affect
the
job
rights
that
was
not
within
the
reach
of
8(b)(1)(a).
i
think
that
i
have
an
easier
case
here
because
the
hypothetical
that
you
have
given
me
presents
a
problem
of
where
the
union
rule
would
be
going
counter,
as
i
understand
the
hypothetical,
to
the
collective
agreement
of
the
parties
and
the
question
is
whether
that
policy
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
i
would
say
that
only
half
of
-–
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
you
are
quite
right
justice
fortas
in
saying
that
our
principle
line
of
defense
here
is
that
the
facts
of
this
case
show
that
this
is
not
a
case
where
what
the
union
is
doing
here
is
going
contrary
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
i
said
that
in
order
–-
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
don't
think
it
would
if
you
read
allis-chalmers
as
broadly
as
i
was
suggesting
that
it
could
be
read,
namely
that
the
union,
that
8(b)(1)(a)
does
not
reach
the
union
when
it
imposes
reasonable
discipline
by
hypothesis
–-
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
might,
as
i
said,
if
you
read
allis-chalmers
as
holding
that
8(b)(1)(a)
does
not
breach
reasonable
union
discipline
or
violation
of
a
membership
rule
that
is
not
(inaudible)
or
invalid
on
its
face,
then
i
think
that
we
come
off
to
the
same
conclusion
in
the
hypothetical
that
mr.
justice
fortas
has
given
me
as
i
am
coming
out
here
.i
don't
think
however
that
it
is
necessary
to
answer
that
question
for
this
case
because
on
the
findings
of
the
court
and
the
examiner
in
the
court
of
appeals
i
think
that
we
have
a
much
easier
case
because
on
those
findings
what
--
the
union
rule
here
is
not
in
conflict
with
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
this
is
one
of
those
situations,
which
professor
cox
and
dean
shulman
referred
to
in
their
writings
when
they
have
said
that
in
the
ideal
arrangement
you
have
everything
spelled
out
neatly
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
but
more
often
than
not
the
area
of
joint
control
is
not
that
neatly
spelled
out.
you
get
an
agreement
which
is
not
clear.
it
represents
a
truce
what
as
professor
cox
has
said
armistice
line
is
nowhere
on
the
map.
you
have
to
spell
that
out
from
the
total
situation
here
and
if
you
look
at
what
has
been
going
on
in
this
plant
for
at
least
17
years,
you
find
as
the
trial
examiner
or
as
the
board
summed
up
on
page
128
of
the
record,
when
it
said,
the
company
as
a
practical
matter
has
accepted
the
ceiling
as
an
integral
part
of
the
modus
operandi
and
has
recognized
the
ceilings
as
forming
an
important
element
of
its
negotiated
wage
structure
and
that
is
what
we
have
in
this
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
they
were
fined
as
in
allis-chalmers
and
the
union
has
a
brought
a
suit
in
the
wisconsin
courts,
which
is
pending
to
collect
the
fine.
now
i
realize
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
with
this
qualification
they
can
produce
as
much
as
they
want.
your
honor
the
way
the
rule
operates
is
that
they
can't
--
they
have,
they
cannot
claim
immediate
payment.
they
have
to
defer
the
payment
or
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
by
this
banking
arrangement,
which
the
company
cooperates
with,
the
extra
production
goes
into
the
company's
line
of
production.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
company
did
that
as
a
result
of
bargaining
with
the
union,
where
the
union
--
the
company
wanted
to
eliminate
this
banking
arrangement
they
weren't
able
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
they
weren't
--
that
is
correct.
the
union
got
a
quid
pro
quo
for
raising
the
ceiling
and
the
company
got
a
quid
pro
quo
in
that
the
company
agreed
to
raise
the
hourly
minimum.
the
union
in
turn
gave
the
company
a
quid
pro
quo
by
agreeing
to
raise
the
ceiling.
mr.
norton
j.
come
but
the
union
could
do
that
your
honor
to
the
extent
of
providing,
bargaining
with
the
employer
for
just
a
straight
hourly
rate.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
record
does
not
bear
out
his
contention
that
there
was
featherbedding.
mr.
norton
j.
come
but
the
union
could
go
to
the
extent
as
they
did
with
half
of
the
employees
in
this
plant,
which
are
not
involved
in
this
case,
and
put
them
on
a
straight
hourly
rate.
and
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
they
weren't
able
to
get
the
whole
loaf
here,
but
neither
was
the
company,
as
the
president
of
the
company
pointed
out
in
some
of
his
testimony
in
the
record,
that's
the
very
essence
of
collective
bargaining.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
of
course
the
union
has
to
represent
the
group
your
honor
and
they
have
to
think
of
the
older
workers,
maintaining
the
differentials
and
things
of
that
sort.
mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court?
the
jurisdictional
point,
your
honor
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
we
believe
nonetheless
that
under
the
minneapolis
honeywell
decision
of
this
court
that
the
petition
was
untimely
filed
and
that
the
90-day
period
runs
from
the
date
of
the
march
5
order.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
we
were
not
served
with
a
copy
of
that
order,
that
is
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
i
admit
it
does
not
make
much
equity.
mr.
norton
j.
come
right
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
we
did.
we
raised
it
as
--
in
our
opposition
to
certiorari
that
was
one
of
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
we
did
your
honor.
we
raised
it
in
the
point
two
of
our
brief.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
quite
the
contrary.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
we
have,
we
have
raised
it.
mr.
norton
j.
come
all
i
know
is
that
we
have
gotten
the
cert
denied,
whether
that
was
the
reason
that
the
petition
was
denied
or
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
that
is
correct.
there's
never
been
an
authoritative
ruling
on
it,
however
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
in
some
circuits
it
is.
in
other
circuits
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
would
say
that
sometimes
we
are
and
sometimes
we're
not.
i
know
that
our
practice
is
not
to
take
a
chance.
we
always
count
our
time
from
the
date
of
the
court's
decision.
we'll
start
with
a
copy
of
the
court's
decision
and
we
have
found
from
practice
that
some
circuits
like
the
seventh
circuit
will
enter
an
order
or
judgment
the
same
day
that
they
enter
the
decision.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
usually
the
decree
is
entered
no
later
than
30
days
after
the
decision.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
the
new
federal
rules
of
appellant
procedure
which
have
taken
effect
subsequent
to
this
case
purport
to
have
a
uniform
provision
covering
this
situation.
however,
significantly
that
rule
talks
in
terms
of
an
order
enforcing,
the
administrative
order.
here
you
did
not
have
as
you
typically
have
whether
that's
an
enforcement
of
the
board's
order
or
an
enforcement
in
part,
any
possibility
that
a
subsequent
decree
might
raise
a
question
as
to
the
terms
of
the
prohibition
that
would
be
entered
because
all
that
the
court
did
here
was
to
affirm
the
board's
dismissal
of
the
complaint
and
no
decree
that
could
subsequently
be
entered,
would
there
be
likely,
there
would
be
any
question
as
to
what
the
terms
of
that
is
going
to
be.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
it
probably
would
be
although
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
it
probably
would
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
at
least
as
i
read
the
new
rule.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i'll
rest
on
the
presentation
i
made
your
honor.
i
do
think
though
that
we
ought
to
turn
to
the
facts
of
this
case
because
i
think
that
they
are
very
important
and
because
i
think
that
they're
somewhat
unusual.
now
on
the
facts
of
the
case,
as
found
by
the
board's
trial
examiner,
the
board,
and
is
sustained
by
the
seventh
circuit.
we
do
not
have
a
situation
that
my
colleague
has
been
positing
here.
what
we
do
have
here
is
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
operative
part
of
which
is
set
out
at
page
46
of
the
record.
it
simply
provides
the
jobs,
i'm
reading
from
paragraph
90,
section
(1),
shall
be
so
priced
as
a
result
of
a
time
study
that
the
average
competent
operator
working
at
a
reasonable
pace
shall
earn
not
less
than
the
machine
rate
of
his
assigned
task.
and
then
if
you
look
at
the
bottom
of
page
47,
you
see
that
these
were
classifications,
they
set
a
figure
called
a
machine
rate
for
grade
one
and
the
contract
goes
on,
there
are
five
different
classifications
with
different
machine
rates,
that
their
rate
as
a
lower
rate
that's
paid
under
a
certain
circumstances
and
is
not
irrelevant,
but
roughly
what
this
machine
rate
represents
is
this.
it
reflects
a
determination
on
the
basis
of
time
studies
of
the
number
of
pieces
of
work
that
an
average
operator
would
turn
out
in
an
hour
after
an
adjustment
for
such
factors
as
picking
up
and
cleaning
tools,
fatigue
and
personal
needs.
now
this
is
all
that
the
contract
establishes
here.
it
doesn't
have
a
provision
that
my
opponent
has
been
referring
to
that
an
employee
can
be
paid
for
turning
out
as
much
as
he
pleases
or
that
he
has
to
give
over
and
above
the
machine
rate
here
in
order
to
fulfill
his
obligation,
the
work
in
eight
hour
day.
now,
by
taking
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
the
--
there's
another
provision
of
the
contract
that
says
that
the
work
shift
is
from
certain
hour
to
the
certain
hours
and
that
accomplishes
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
he
still
must
stay
on
his
job
and
the
record
shows
that
they
do
stay
on
the
job,
that
the
time
that,
that
is
available
is
spent
usually
in
preparing
the
machines
for
the
next
day's
work
that,
although
there
has
been
occasionally
some
problem
with
too
much
talking,
or
card
playing,
or
other
things
of
that
sort
that
whenever
the
union
or
the
company
has
promulgated
rules
to
cut
that
out,
the,
it
has
stopped
and
that
the
union
stewards
have
cooperated
in
cutting
out
any
of
those
diversions.
in
addition
to
that,
the
allowances
that
have
been
worked
into,
in
for
fatigue
and
rest,
and
so
on
in
establishing
the
machine
rate,
the
evidence
in
the
record
shows
is
it
allows
for
the
equivalent
of
about
48
minutes,
which
the
employee
is
free
to
take
during
the
course
of
the
time.
so
if
he
prefers
to
take
that
at
the
end
of
the
8
hours
shift,
there's
nothing
in
the
contract
that
would
prevent
him
from
doing
so.
now
as
this
court
is
well
aware,
unions
have
traditionally
been
opposed
to
incentive
pay
systems
not
primary
for
the
featherbedding
reasons
that
my
opponent
has
indicated,
but
for
the
perfectly
legitimate
reasons
that
they
have
feared
that
this
could
result
in
employees
working
themselves
out
of
jobs
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i'm
going
to
come
to
that
in
a
moment
after
establishing
--
which
i
have
currently
do
not
have
to
belabor
that
you
cannot
say
that
a
limitation
on
incentive
earnings
is
something
that
is
illegal
on
its
face
or
horrendous.
it
serves
a
very
legitimate
interest
of
a
labor
union
and
of
its
members
and
i
might
add
as
justice
white
pointed
out
that
these
employees
here
were
longstanding
members
of
the
union.
one
of
them
had
been
a
member
for
at
least
17
years
and
had
been
a
union
steward
throughout
most
of
this
period.
although
there
was
a
union
security
arrangement
in
this
case
like
the
union
security
arrangement
in
allis-chalmers,
it
gave
the
employees
the
option
of
either
becoming
full-fledged
union
members
or
paying
only
a
service
fee,
and
all
of
the
four
plaintiffs
here
insofar
as
the
record
shows
opted
to
become
full-fledged
union
members
and
have
been
so
for
many
years.
now
since
at
least
1944,
the
union
here
has
by
membership
rule
placed
a
ceiling
on
the
amount
above
the
minimum
or
the
machine
rate
which
an
employee
member
may
claim
as
current
earnings.
now
the,
if
the
present,
the
time
of
this
hearing,
the
ceilings
were
about
$0.40
to
$0.50
an
hour
above
the
machine
rate.
they're
shown
at
page
50
of
the
record,
the
comparison
between
the
machine
rate
and
the
ceiling
rate.
now,
it's
important
to
emphasize
that
the
rule
as
it
has
been
consistently
interpreted
and
applied
does
not
preclude
the
employee
from
producing
in
excess
of
the
ceiling.
and
if
he
does,
the
extra
production
physically
enters
the
flow
of
company
operations.
the
rule
merely
requires
an
employee
to
forgo
demanding
immediate
compensation
under
the
banking
procedure
that
mr.
justice
brennan
referred
to
for
a
later
time,
when
the
receipt
of
the
earnings
would
be
less
likely
to
disrupt
employee
morale
and
working
conditions.
well,
for
example
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
there
are
times
when
the,
employee's
machine
is
down
due
to
a
breakdown
and
other
shortage
of
material
or
something
of
that
sort
now
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
under
the
--
in
those
circumstances
under
the
contract,
the
company
would
be
obligated
even
though
he
was
not
turning
out
any
production
to
either
at
the
machine
rate
or
at
the
lower
day
rate.
under
these
ceiling
banking
system,
the
employee
can
draw
on
the
earnings
that
he
has
accumulated
in
there
and
be
paid
at
the
ceiling
rate
and
the
company
has
co-operated
by
paying
him
at
such
a
rate.
moreover
it
has
furnished
the
production
cards
to
the
union
so
that
the
union
can
periodically
check
compliance
with
the
ceiling
and
further
more
it
pays
the
union
stewards
for
the
time
that
they
spend
in
checking
the
cards.
so
that
this
ceiling
system
as
it
operates
in
this
plant
could
not
possibly
operate
without
a
substantial
amount
of
employer
co-operation
and
acquiescence
and
indeed
that
was
the
finding
of
the
board
and
the
trial
examiner
and
the
court
below.
now
i
want
to
get
to
the
question
of
the
collective
bargaining.
the
ceiling
rule
to
be
sure
was
unilateral
in
origin.
if
we
go
back
to
1944
or
even
to
1938
actually
when
it
first
started
as
a
result
of
a
gentleman's
agreement
among
the
union
members.
however,
since
then
it
has
been
regularly
the
subject
of
collective
bargaining
between
the
employer
and
the
union
when
the
contracts
have
come
up
for
negotiation.
indeed
petitioners
concede
at
page
3
of
their
brief
that
the
ceilings
have
been
the
subject
of
collective
bargaining.
now
i'll
refer
you
to
the
findings
of
the
trial
examiner
on
page
68
of
the
record,
which
sets
forth
the
way
the
typical
negotiation
works,
the
reading
as
i
pass
through
here.
among
the
subjects
embraced
by
the
contract
negotiations,
is
the
setting
of
the
ceiling
rate.
and
skipping
down
a
bit
further
and
so
into
typical
negotiations,
the
employer
begins
by
asking
the
union
to
agree
to
eliminate
the
ceiling
and
as
the
second
alternative
proposes
a
raise
in
the
ceiling.
as
an
inducement
thereof,
it
may
offer
a
concession
in
a
form
of
a
raise
in
the
guaranteed
roe
machine
rate
and
the
raise
in
turn
conditions
be
extent
to
which
the
union
will
agree
to
raise
the
ceiling.
and
then
the
trial
examiner
concludes
at
the
bottom
of
69,
the
status
thus
achieved
by
the
ceiling
program
is
the
product
of
hard
bargaining.
and
this
is
reflected
even
in
some
of
the
written
agreements
that
the
parties
have
concluded.
for
instance,
the
1953
contract
which
is
not
reprinted
here,
but
is
in
general
counsel's
exhibit
17,
provided
specifically
that
the
previous
agreement
be
modified
to
increase
the
ceilings,
a
total
of
13
cents
per
hour.
in
the
1956
strike
settlement
agreement,
which
is
set
forth
in
the
record,
at
page
49
at
the
bottom
it
says
the
ceilings
on
earnings
is
to
be
raised
ten
cents
per
hour
above
the
general
increase
of
an
earlier
date.
and
as
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
i'd
have
a
much
tougher
case,
but
i
think
that
you
could
read
allis-chalmers,
which
i
think
is
what
we
come
down
to
the
standing
for
the
proposition
that
so
long
as
the
union
discipline
was
confined
to
fines
or
expulsion
that
did
not
affect
the
job
rights
that
was
not
within
the
reach
of
8(b)(1)(a).
i
think
that
i
have
an
easier
case
here
because
the
hypothetical
that
you
have
given
me
presents
a
problem
of
where
the
union
rule
would
be
going
counter,
as
i
understand
the
hypothetical,
to
the
collective
agreement
of
the
parties
and
the
question
is
whether
that
policy
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
i
would
say
that
only
half
of
-–
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
you
are
quite
right
justice
fortas
in
saying
that
our
principle
line
of
defense
here
is
that
the
facts
of
this
case
show
that
this
is
not
a
case
where
what
the
union
is
doing
here
is
going
contrary
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
i
said
that
in
order
–-
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
don't
think
it
would
if
you
read
allis-chalmers
as
broadly
as
i
was
suggesting
that
it
could
be
read,
namely
that
the
union,
that
8(b)(1)(a)
does
not
reach
the
union
when
it
imposes
reasonable
discipline
by
hypothesis
–-
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
might,
as
i
said,
if
you
read
allis-chalmers
as
holding
that
8(b)(1)(a)
does
not
breach
reasonable
union
discipline
or
violation
of
a
membership
rule
that
is
not
(inaudible)
or
invalid
on
its
face,
then
i
think
that
we
come
off
to
the
same
conclusion
in
the
hypothetical
that
mr.
justice
fortas
has
given
me
as
i
am
coming
out
here
.i
don't
think
however
that
it
is
necessary
to
answer
that
question
for
this
case
because
on
the
findings
of
the
court
and
the
examiner
in
the
court
of
appeals
i
think
that
we
have
a
much
easier
case
because
on
those
findings
what
--
the
union
rule
here
is
not
in
conflict
with
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
this
is
one
of
those
situations,
which
professor
cox
and
dean
shulman
referred
to
in
their
writings
when
they
have
said
that
in
the
ideal
arrangement
you
have
everything
spelled
out
neatly
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
but
more
often
than
not
the
area
of
joint
control
is
not
that
neatly
spelled
out.
you
get
an
agreement
which
is
not
clear.
it
represents
a
truce
what
as
professor
cox
has
said
armistice
line
is
nowhere
on
the
map.
you
have
to
spell
that
out
from
the
total
situation
here
and
if
you
look
at
what
has
been
going
on
in
this
plant
for
at
least
17
years,
you
find
as
the
trial
examiner
or
as
the
board
summed
up
on
page
128
of
the
record,
when
it
said,
the
company
as
a
practical
matter
has
accepted
the
ceiling
as
an
integral
part
of
the
modus
operandi
and
has
recognized
the
ceilings
as
forming
an
important
element
of
its
negotiated
wage
structure
and
that
is
what
we
have
in
this
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
they
were
fined
as
in
allis-chalmers
and
the
union
has
a
brought
a
suit
in
the
wisconsin
courts,
which
is
pending
to
collect
the
fine.
now
i
realize
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
with
this
qualification
they
can
produce
as
much
as
they
want.
your
honor
the
way
the
rule
operates
is
that
they
can't
--
they
have,
they
cannot
claim
immediate
payment.
they
have
to
defer
the
payment
or
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
by
this
banking
arrangement,
which
the
company
cooperates
with,
the
extra
production
goes
into
the
company's
line
of
production.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
company
did
that
as
a
result
of
bargaining
with
the
union,
where
the
union
--
the
company
wanted
to
eliminate
this
banking
arrangement
they
weren't
able
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
they
weren't
--
that
is
correct.
the
union
got
a
quid
pro
quo
for
raising
the
ceiling
and
the
company
got
a
quid
pro
quo
in
that
the
company
agreed
to
raise
the
hourly
minimum.
the
union
in
turn
gave
the
company
a
quid
pro
quo
by
agreeing
to
raise
the
ceiling.
mr.
norton
j.
come
but
the
union
could
do
that
your
honor
to
the
extent
of
providing,
bargaining
with
the
employer
for
just
a
straight
hourly
rate.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
record
does
not
bear
out
his
contention
that
there
was
featherbedding.
mr.
norton
j.
come
but
the
union
could
go
to
the
extent
as
they
did
with
half
of
the
employees
in
this
plant,
which
are
not
involved
in
this
case,
and
put
them
on
a
straight
hourly
rate.
and
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
they
weren't
able
to
get
the
whole
loaf
here,
but
neither
was
the
company,
as
the
president
of
the
company
pointed
out
in
some
of
his
testimony
in
the
record,
that's
the
very
essence
of
collective
bargaining.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
of
course
the
union
has
to
represent
the
group
your
honor
and
they
have
to
think
of
the
older
workers,
maintaining
the
differentials
and
things
of
that
sort.
