mr.
james
urdan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
review
of
a
decree
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
an
order
of
the
labor
board
which
had
dismissed
unfair
labor
practice
charges
against
a
labor
union.
the
case
raises
the
issue
of
whether
it
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
section
8(b)(1)(a)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
when
a
labor
union
finds
one
of
its
members
for
exceeding
a
production
quota,
so
called
‘ceiling’
set
by
the
union.
these
petitioners
are
employees
of
the
wisconsin
motor
corporation
and
--
mr.
james
urdan
the
subject
of
the
ceilings
was
bargained
from
time-to-time.
mr.
james
urdan
they
were
not
agreed
upon
in
the
sense
that
they
were
a
limit
on
the
employee.
the
employee
was
free
to
work,
free
to
make
more
than
the
ceiling
permitted
and
the
employer
had
to
pay
him
under
the
collective
agreement.
there
was
collective
bargaining
over
the
ceilings
as
to
the
general
level
of
the
ceilings,
but
never
were
the
ceilings
accepted
in
bargaining
as
a
limit
on
the
individual
and
as
the
individual
who
is
complaining
here.
mr.
james
urdan
i
think
there's
some
truth
in
both
positions.
from
the
standpoint
of
the
employees
who
are
complaining
here,
the
case
we
have
is
that
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
was
entered
into.
this
union
bargained
it
and
agreed
with
the
employer
and
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
set
no
limit
on
the
production
or
on
the
earnings
of
these
men.
they
could
produce
to
their
capacity,
they
could
claim
pay
for
that
work
and
they
would
have
to
be
paid
for
that
work.
that
is
the
bargain
that
the
union
made
with
the
employer.
now
it
is
true
that
the
employer
and
the
union
bargained
from
time-to-time
about
the
level
of
ceilings,
because
the
employer
recognized
this
is
as
a
fact
of
life
in
the
plant.
he
recognized
that
the
union
had
these
ceilings.
the
employer
recognized
that
it
was
in
his
interest
to
have
the
ceilings
increased
from
time-to-time
and
he
bargained
for
that
objective.
he
tried
to
get
the
ceilings
removed,
not
totally
successfully.
the
union
tried
to
get
the
employer
to
agree
to
the
ceilings
and
they
failed
in
that.
the
employer
never
agreed
to
put
a
ceiling
on
the
earnings
of
these
men.
we
have
in
essence
a
standoff
in
the
bargaining.
neither
side
got
what
it
wanted,
but
as
far
as
these
employees
are
concerned,
they
worked
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
permitted
them
to
exceed
the
ceiling,
to
earn
more
and
to
collect
their
pay
and
the
employer
had
to
pay
them,
employer
could
not
refuse
to
pay
them.
this
is
their
complaint
that
the
union
fine
is
bypassing
the
collective
agreement
and
the
collective
bargaining
process.
mr.
james
urdan
the
collective
bargaining
did
not
establish
ceilings.
the
collective
bargaining
provided
pay
rates
and
pay
ranges
and
if
a
man
worked
on
piecework
and
he
produced
more
pieces,
he
would
be
paid
for
whatever
he
produced
and
that
is
all
that
is
in
the
collective
bargaining.
mr.
james
urdan
the
incentive
pay
started
from
the
beginning,
but
there
were
certain
guarantees
in
the
contract.
it
was
incentive
pay
all
the
way
--
mr.
james
urdan
the
pay
is
computed
on
the
actual
production
starting
with
the
first
unit.
the
incentive
pay
follows
all
the
way
through.
however,
a
man
is
guaranteed
certain
rate
if
his
production
does
not
come
up
to
certain
minimum
standards,
in
that
sense
you
might
say
that
the
incentive
rates
starts
at
this
point
of
guarantee.
mr.
james
urdan
the
guarantee
is
generally
in
terms
of
an
hourly
rate
--
mr.
james
urdan
i
would
say
that
is
not
the
way
it
works.
mr.
james
urdan
there
is
not
a
ceiling
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
there
is
an
incentive
pay
plan
where
the
man
is
paid
for
the
units
that
he
produces.
now
the
union
has
set
a
maximum
on
the
pay
that
they
want
the
man
to
earn.
they
say
only
produce
that
many
units
that
will
get
you
up
to
that
pay
level,
using
the
process
of
division
as
you
just
described
it.
that
is
what
the
union
says
the
man
should
do,
and
that
is
so
called
‘ceiling.'
that
is
not
reflected
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
as
such.
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
establishes
the
rates
for
the
units.
mr.
james
urdan
no,
it
is
a
higher
rate.
mr.
james
urdan
it
exceeds
the
minimum
guaranteed
rate.
but
there's
no
ceiling
and
there's
no
limit
in
the
agreement
as
such.
the
agreement
says
the
man
is
to
work
eight
hours
a
day.
whatever
he
produces
he
will
be
paid
for.
the
effect
of
the
ceiling
as
shown
very
clearly
by
the
record
is
that
the
man
does
not
work
eight
hours
a
day.
he's
any
kind
of
worker
at
all,
he
finishes
his
work
much
more
quickly.
he
has
no
need
to
abide
by
the
agreement
to
work
his
eight
hours.
mr.
james
urdan
i
think
we
are
very
close,
we
are
very
close
to
this
line.
we
--
mr.
james
urdan
this
could
be
possible.
this
issue
has
not
been
tested
because
the
employer
apparently
has
not
made
an
issue
of
it.
mr.
james
urdan
when
you
say
breaching
the
contract,
i
think
we
are
getting
at
a
concept
of
what
the
employer
is
entitled
to.
employer
is
entitled
to
have
the
man
perform
a
fair
day's
work.
mr.
james
urdan
not
that
language,
however
the
contract
does
set
shifts
and
i
think
it
is
recognized
that
-–
mr.
james
urdan
absolutely
not.
mr.
james
urdan
this
not
our
position.
mr.
james
urdan
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
urdan
we
represent
the
employees.
mr.
james
urdan
we
represent
the
individuals.
the
employer
has
not
participated
or
raised
any
complaint
in
this
proceeding.
mr.
james
urdan
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
in
an
employment
--
mr.
james
urdan
an
agreement
to
limit
production,
which
is
negotiated
with
an
employer
and
which
is
incorporated
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
protected.
an
agreement
to
limit
production,
which
is
not
negotiated,
is
not
protected
and
there
are
numerous
cases
on
this
general
subject
that
are
in
our
brief
as
far
as
the
employer
--
mr.
james
urdan
well
i
tend
to
agree
with
that.
i
think
the
employer
here
has
never
raised
this
issue.
i
don't
contend
that
it
is
a
breach
of
contract,
nor
do
i
consider
that
this
is
in
anyway
essential
to
the
case
of
these
petitioners.
mr.
james
urdan
that
is
the
way
the
process
works.
mr.
james
urdan
the
employer
has
accepted
this
as
a
procedure
--
mr.
james
urdan
no
the
employee
keeps
his
own
records
of
his
bank.
mr.
james
urdan
i
would
say
he
does
not.
the
employer
pays
--
mr.
james
urdan
he
pays
for
the
production
that
is
reported.
if
the
employee
doesn't
report
it,
the
employer
generally
doesn't
know
about
it.
mr.
james
urdan
the
employer
generally
did
not
have
records
as
to
when
the
actual
production
took
place.
mr.
james
urdan
the
employer
paid
as
the
work
was
reported
for
pay.
mr.
james
urdan
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
urdan
the
record
is
quite
confused
on
his
point,
but
the
picture
that
comes
out
is
that
the
employer
does
not
reconcile
the
pieces
flowing
through
with
the
pay
records.
employer
knows
the
banking
is
going
on,
but
does
not
reconcile
--
mr.
james
urdan
i
think
this
is
a
very
pertinent
question.
it
has
some
humor
in
it.
the
suggestion
is
made
in
the
record
that
this
practice
benefits
the
company.
this
is
not
correct
and
the
company
has
had
very
definite
difficulties
from
this
practice.
i
think
we
are
concerned
here
with
reconciling
two
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
within
the
last
two
years.
in
allis-chalmers
case,
we
had
the
question
of
a
union
fine
against
a
member
for
crossing
a
picket
line
and
working
during
a
strike,
a
question
of
whether
that
violated
section
8(b)(1)(a).
more
recently,
in
the
marine
and
ship
building
workers
case,
there
was
a
question
of
expulsion
of
a
member
for
having
filed
charges
with
the
nlrb.
in
the
allis-chalmers
decision,
the
holding
was
that
there
was
not
a
violation
of
the
statute.
in
the
marine
and
ship
building
workers
case
there
was
a
holding
that
the
statute
had
been
violated,
both
cases
involving
union
discipline.
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
two
cases,
we
find
two
questions
that
the
court
is
asking.
what
is
the
union
objective?
what
are
they
trying
to
accomplish?
how
does
their
objective
comport
with
the
policies
of
the
act?
secondly,
what
is
the
method
the
union
is
using?
is
the
method
one
that
conforms
with
the
policies
of
the
act?
now
looking
first
at
the
union
objective,
i
think
we
have
a
case
much
closer
to
the
marine
and
ship
building
workers
and
to
allis-chalmers.
allis-chalmers
involves
an
economic
strike.
union
was
trying
to
sustain
and
support
that
economic
strike.
this
is
an
activity
that
has
the
highest
degree
of
protection
under
the
act.
in
marine
and
ship
building
by
contrast,
the
union
was
trying
to
restrict
the
access
of
the
employee
to
the
processes
of
the
board,
a
very
important
policy
was
being
offended.
now
here
the
union
objective
is
simply
to
have
more
men
on
the
job
than
the
job
requires.
it's
a
matter
of
degree
on
this
question
of
how
men
it
takes
to
do
the
work.
in
an
extreme
case,
where
you
ask
for
pay
for
men
who
aren't
even
there,
we
have
an
explicit
unfair
labor
practice
under
the
act.
there
are
lesser
forms
of
this
type
of
production
restriction.
they
are
not
unfair
labor
practices,
but
they
are
not
even
protected
activities
under
the
act.
if
the
employer
sought
to
discipline
the
employee
for
this
type
of
restriction,
the
employer
could.
in
fact,
the
union
concedes
this
very
point
in
its
brief.
we
have
here
--
mr.
james
urdan
it
is
not
for
not
trying
to
make
more
pay
--
mr.
james
urdan
a
restriction
on
production
by
slow
down,
similar
methods
has
been
found
to
be
unprotected
activity
under
the
act,
such
that
the
employer
may
lawfully
discipline
the
employee
for
engaging
in
such
an
activity.
mr.
james
urdan
in
this
case,
the
people
who
are
engaging
in
ceiling
practices
to
the
point
of
not
performing
their
work,
as
the
record
shows,
stopping
work
an
hour
or
two
early
and
reading
magazine
--
mr.
james
urdan
they
completed
their
–-
mr.
james
urdan
i
am
saying
so
far
as
the
act
is
concerned,
this
is
an
unprotected
activity.
now
whether
the
employer
could
enforce
a
discharge
in
this
case
is
a
question
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement;
and
if
the
employer
attempted
to
discipline
an
employee
in
this
type
of
situation,
he
would
be
faced
with
the
defenses
and
arguments
that
he
had
acquiesced
to
this,
he
had
bargained
the
ceiling,
he
had
accepted
the
ceiling,
therefore
he,
this
employer
could
not
enforce
discipline,
but
this
would
not
flow
from
the
act
and
neither
would
this
be
a
protected
activity
under
the
act.
this
would
be
a
question
of
the
contractual
limitation
on
--
mr.
james
urdan
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
also
provides
restrictions
on
discipline.
discipline
must
be
for
just
cause,
this
is
the
customary
standard.
mr.
james
urdan
if
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
established
the
ceiling
and
said
you
cannot
collect
more
pay
no
matter
what
you
produce
--
mr.
james
urdan
very
definitely.
if
the
agreement
permitted
them
to
work
for
and
earn
more
than
that
is
what
they
should
be
permitted
to
do.
mr.
james
urdan
union
cannot
make
a
bargain
with
the
employer
and
then
pull
it
away
by
its
fine?
mr.
james
urdan
i
can
only
say
that
would
be
a
very
remarkable
contract.
i
don't
think
the
subject
--
mr.
james
urdan
i
think
this
is
the
point
raised
in
the
brief
of
the
amicus
here,
that
the
question
of
whether
the
union
has
a
rule
that
can
be
enforced
should
not
be
part
of
the
bargaining
process.
the
bargaining
process
should
not
get
itself
lost
in
this
maze
of
having
the
employer
looking
into
the
union
disciplinary
process,
deciding
which
union
rules
he
likes,
and
which
he
doesn't,
and
which
should
go
in
the
contract
and
which
shouldn't.
this
should
be
insulated
from
the
collective
bargaining
process.
the
employer
makes
an
agreement
here
that
says
the
man
can
be
paid
for
what
he
produces,
that
is
the
deal
the
union
agreed
to.
these
men
tried
to
produce
just
as
the
agreement
tells
them
they
may
do
then
the
union
finds
them.
it
takes
away
the
bargain
that
it
made
itself.
now
this
is
a
very
dangerous
precedent
for
the
collective
bargaining
process.
collective
bargaining
process
is
the
heart
of
this
act.
the
whole
concept
of
the
act
is
that
the
party
should
sit
down,
reason
together,
attempt
to
resolve
their
differences.
and
when
you
permit
the
union
to
accomplish
its
objectives
by
finding
its
members,
not
by
collective
bargaining
then
the
whole
process
has
been
weakened.
the
fruit
of
the
bargaining,
the
agreement
has
no
meaning
if
the
man
can't
take
advantage
of
it.
certainly
we
are
not
within
the
realm
of
internal
union
affairs
as
that
concept
is
used
in
the
allis-chalmers'
case.
it's
no
longer
an
internal
matter
when
you
tell
the
man
he
cannot
earn
the
money
that
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
provides;
this
is
the
very
heart
of
the
wage
and
employment
relationship.
mr.
james
urdan
that
is
correct.
the
statute
protects
the
union
member
just
as
much
as
the
non-member.
i
think
the
marine
&
shipbuilding
case
of
course
is
the
example
of
this.
the
union
member
has
the
same
protection.
congress
did
not
make
any
distinction
between
the
members
and
the
non-members.
there
are
many
cases
that
have
pointed
this
out,
radio
officers'
and
teamsters'
case
of
1954
setting
forth
this
basic
ground
rule
that
a
man
can
be
a
good,
bad
or
indifferent
union
member.
he
only
has
to
pay
his
dues,
that
is
the
price
of
admission.
there
is
a
quote
from
senator
taft
which
appears
in
the
footnote
of
the
allis-chalmers
decision
which
reads
right
on
this
subject.
senator
taft
said,
“'(m)erely
to
require
that
unions
be
subject
to
the
same
rules
that
govern
employers,
and
that
they
do
not
have
the
right
to
interfere
with
or
coerce
employees,
either
their
own
members
or
those
outside
the
union,
is
such
a
clear
matter,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
so
easy
to
determine,
that
i
would
hope
we
would
all
agree.”
the
act
applies
equally
to
the
member
and
to
the
non-member.
this
is
established.
in
this
connection,
i
think
we
should
look
at
the
proviso
to
section
8(b)(1)(a),
so
i
think
the
proviso
has
been
badly
misconstrued.
i
think
the
purpose
of
the
proviso
has
been
misunderstood.
the
proviso
says
that
the
union
may
establish
rules
with
respect
to
acquisition
and
retention
of
membership.
this
has
been
looked
at
in
the
context
of
these
fine
cases
as
a
guarantee
that
the
union
can
control
its
members.
this
was
not
the
purpose
of
the
proviso
and
nothing
to
do
with
control
of
members.
the
purpose
of
the
proviso
was
to
permit
unions
to
decide
who
their
members
shall
be,
not
to
tell
the
member
what
to
do,
but
to
decide
who
the
member
shall
be
was
a
concept
of
freedom
of
association.
the
union
can
decide
who
will
participate.
there
is
traces
from
the
debate
that
went
on
in
congress
preceding
the
introduction
of
section
8(b)(1)(a).
it
was
a
great
issue
in
the
congressional
debates
as
to
the
closed
shop.
there
is
a
lot
of
public
concern
about
this
issue.
the
idea
that
the
man
had
to
belong
to
the
union
in
order
to
hold
a
job.
the
choice
that
was
presented
to
the
congress
either
open
up
the
union
or
open
up
the
job.
there
were
strong
advocates
of
the
position
that
the
union
should
be
open
that
every
man
should
have
right
to
join
the
union.
now
this
issue
was
debated
and
the
unions
didn't
like
that
idea
and
a
number
of
senators,
particularly
from
the
south
did
not
like
the
idea
that
the
union
should
be
open
because
they
had
segregated
unions,
and
these
very
issues
were
debated
explicitly
and
so
the
decision
was
reached,
you
don't
have
to
have
an
open
union.
you
don't
have
to
let
people
in
if
you
don't
want
to.
instead
we'll
have
the
open
shot
or
the
open
job
or
you
don't
have
to
be
a
member.
now
this
was
the
background
when
section
8(b)(1)(a)
was
introduced.
section
8(b)(1)(a)
says
you
cannot
coerce
a
member,
you
cannot
coerce
an
employee
in
the
exercise
of
his
rights
under
section
7.
one
of
those
rights
being
the
right
to
participate
in
union
activities.
now
the
opponents
of
the
open
union
became
very
concerned
again.
they
said
is
this
going
to
open
up
the
union?
is
it
going
to
be
considered
restraint
or
coercion
when
we
segregate
or
keep
people
out
of
the
union
and
that
is
why
the
proviso
was
introduced.
it
was
to
confirm
this
concept
that
the
union
didn't
have
to
be
open.
the
proviso
was
introduced
simply
to
confirm
the
commitments
that
had
been
made
in
this
debate
on
the
closed
shop.
it
is
not
in
any
sense
a
grant
of
authority
to
control
the
actions
of
the
members,
rather
it
is
to
guarantee
to
the
union
that
it
can
control
its
own
membership
and
who
will
participate
within
the
union.
now,
the
proviso
to
8(b)(1)(a)
is
not
a
grant
of
authority
to
discipline.
now,
we
have
also
in
this
case
a
jurisdictional
issue.
i'd
like
to
devote
a
few
minutes
to
that.
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
within
90
days
of
the
decree
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
question
has
been
raised
whether
the
90-day
period
should
run
from
the
date
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
an
order
that
was
entered
that
same
day.
i
think
reviewing
the
record
it
will
be
perfectly
clear
that
the
intention
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
the
decree
of
april
16th
was
the
decree
in
the
case.
the
statute
starts
the
90-day
period
running
from
the
date
of
entry
of
the
judgment
or
decree.
it
doesn't
say
the
date
of
the
opinion,
it
doesn't
say
the
date
of
the
decision,
it
doesn't
say
the
date
of
the
resolution
of
the
case.
it
says
the
date
of
entry
of
the
judgment
or
decree.
now
after
the
opinion
of
the
court
on
march
5th,
the
board
itself
sent
a
proposed
decree
to
the
court
and
the
board
in
its
letter
to
the
court
said
after
entry
of
the
decree
please
send
us
a
copy.
the
board
acknowledged
that
there
had
been
no
decree
at
that
point.
subsequently,
the
court
entered
the
decree
and
the
clerk
of
the
court
wrote
to
all
the
parties
enclosing
a
certified
copy,
“copy
of
the
final
decree
entered
by
this
court
on
april
16,
1968.”
i
think
it's
perfectly
clear
what
the
court
intended.
april
16th
decree
was
the
decree
in
the
case
and
the
petition
was
filed
within
90
days
thereafter.
mr.
james
urdan
there
is
no
difference
in
substance.
there
is
a
difference
in
form.
the
order
of
march
5,
for
example
is
entered
by
the
clerk,
the
decree
is
signed
by
the
judges.
the
order
of
march
5
is
in
form
tentative.
it
says
by
its
own
terms
upon
presentation
an
appropriate
decree
will
be
entered.
it
is
in
form
a
tentative
order.
it
was
entered
by
the
clerk
without
any
notice
to
the
parties.
the
order
of
march
5
was
not
communicated
to
the
parties
and
apparently
the
board
didn't
know
about
it,
because
it
is
sent
along
a
proposed
decree
some
weeks
later,
without
even
mentioning
the
prior
order
nor
does
the
decree
mention
the
prior
order.
the
rule
of
the
court
provided
for
entry
of
decrees
following
settlement
and
that
is
what
was
done
here.
there
is
also
a
rule
of
the
court
providing
for
entry
of
judgment
on
the
decision
day,
but
the
court
quite
obviously
by
this
set
of
circumstances
was
not
following
that
prior
rule.
the
court
was
not
purporting
to
enter
its
judgment.
i
think
the
cases
as
set
forth
in
our
brief
establish
that
it
is
the
intention
of
the
court
that
must
be
given
effect.
when
did
the
court
intend
that
this
decree
be
entered?
and
that
is
perfectly
clearly
april
the
16th.
mr.
james
urdan
i'd
like
to
comment
first
on
the
last
two
points
made
by
counsel
for
the
union.
the
union
position
asserts
section
8(b)(1)(a)
is
violated
when
you
also
violate
section
8(b)(2),
(3)
or
(4)
or
(5)
or
(6).
we
cannot
accept
this
reading
of
this
statute.
8(b)(1)(a)
has
a
purpose
of
its
own
and
it's
been
found
to
be
violated
without
also
involving
other
sections
of
section
8(b).
the
suggestion
that
the
employees
have
a
remedy
in
the
common
law
courts
is
perhaps
generous,
but
not
very
helpful.
wisconsin
courts
have
said
that
the
union
fine
is
collectable.
they've
said
this
on
the
basis
of
the
allis-chalmers
decision.
they
have
also
said
that
even
a
contrary
state
policy
can't
be
enforced.
they
say
because
of
the
allis-chalmers
rational
we
can't
even
apply
our
own
wisconsin
law.
we
have
to
permit
collection
of
the
fine.
these
employees
are
not
going
to
get
much
relief
from
the
wisconsin
supreme
court.
now
the
contention
is
made
that
this
a
reasonable
rule
and
i
think
the
record
shows
that
it
is
not
a
reasonable
rule.
employees
do
not
put
in
a
normal
working
day
until
the
company
attempted
to
impose
some
restrictions,
there
was
card
playing,
reading
of
magazines,
it
didn't
look
like
an
industrial
plant.
the
president
of
the
company
testified
at
the
hearing
that
he
was
ashamed,
the
president
was
ashamed
to
take
visitors
into
the
plant
after
lunch
because
the
man
aren't
working.
you
get
these
unreasonable
results
when
you
permit
unreasonable
coercion,
that's
precisely
why
coercion
is
outlawed
by
congress.
when
you
permit
coercion,
the
union
doesn't
have
to
worry
whether
it's
a
reasonable
rule
or
not.
they
just
go
ahead
and
enforce
it.
the
union
says
its
legitimate
interests
are
involved
and
certainly
there
is
a
legitimate
interest
in
negotiating
workloads
and
matters
of
this
sort,
but
the
question
of
the
legitimate
interest
includes
the
method
that
is
used
to
attain
the
objective
just
because
it's
a
worthy
objective
would
not
permit
an
impermissible
method
and
this
method
is
coercive.
mr.
james
urdan
this
would
be
the
proper
way
for
the
employer
to
proceed.
we
don't
have
to
come
here
speaking
for
the
employer,
we
speak
for
the
man
who
are
working
under
a
contract
that
doesn't
say
that.
the
contract
says
they'll
be
paid
for
the
work
they
produce,
the
union
is
trying
to
prevent
them
from
doing
that.
you
are
perfectly
correct
that
the
employer
has
his
remedy
in
collective
bargaining.
these
employees
do
not.
now
the
union
tells
us
that
the
rule
here
is
not
a
production
restriction
as
such.
they
cite
various
text
writers
who
to
tell
the
reasons
why
incentive
pay
is
objectionable.
these
texts
are
interesting,
but
that
isn't
what
the
union
witnesses
said
at
the
hearing.
the
union,
one
of
the
founders
of
the
union
and
the
man
who
was
intimately
involved
in
the
creation
of
the
ceiling
testified
at
the
hearing,
this
is
at
page
45
of
the
appendix.
we
wanted
to
see
that
this
labor
state
keep
as
many
fellows
working
as
we
possibly
could
and
we
know
if
we
put
this
thing
on
there
it
would
provide
for
at
least
a
few
more
fellows
to
stay
at
work.
and
he
says
the
fellows
are
for
this
ceiling
because
it
provides
jobs.
then
he
went
on.
he
was
asked
what
would
happen
if
they
took
the
ceiling
off.
he
didn't
say
there
would
be
jealousies,
he
didn't
say
the
older
workers
would
be
prejudiced,
he
didn't
recite
any
of
these
reasons
[inaudible]
now
advances.
he
says,
if
the
ceiling
were
taken
off,
it
would
mean
a
loss
of
jobs.
that
is
what
the
union
was
trying
to
accomplish,
having
more
men
at
work
than
were
required.
now
the
union
doesn't
need
this
power.
this
is
not
like
the
allis-chalmers
case
where
you
have
no
way
to
prevent
a
man
from
going
to
work
during
the
strike.
in
the
allis-chalmers
case
there
is
no
contract
in
existence.
the
union
has
no
effective
remedy.
they
have
no
way
of
stopping
the
man.
sometimes
they
tried
to
stop
them
physically.
other
than
that
there
is
no
way
to
accomplish
their
objective.
well
that's
not
true
here.
mr.
james
urdan
i
might
say
first
we
certainly
don't
agree
with
the
allis-chalmers
decision.
i
think
the
dissenting
opinion
makes
considerably
more
sense
to
us
on
our
side.
mr.
james
urdan
that's
exactly
right
and
i
think
this
is
a
great
evil
of
the
allis-chalmers
decision,
and
a
great
evil
of
the
union
position
here
that
it
puts
the
employee
in
the
middle.
union
brief
says,
should
an
employer
refuse
to
produce
a
fair
day's
work
under
a
union
pay
ceiling
the
employer
is
free
to
discipline
or
discharge
the
worker.
mr.
james
urdan
there
are
two
very
important
distinctions
from
the
allis-chalmers
case.
the
first
the
purpose
of
the
union
rule,
what
is
it
that
the
union
is
trying
to
accomplish?
secondly
does
the
method
used
by
the
union
confirm
with
the
statutory
policy.
in
the
allis-chalmers
case,
the
strike
was
considered
to
be
so
important,
the
union
had
no
other
method
other
than
violence
for
accomplishing
its
objective.
here
the
union
has
no
such
need.
it
can
accomplish
its
objective
by
collective
bargaining
and
that
is
precisely
what
the
act
envisions.
this
is
how
the
union
should
resolve
questions
of
pay
and
production
loads.
mr.
scofield
is
not
a
young
man,
he
is
not
an
eager
beaver.
i
wish
he
were
here
in
the
court
room,
so
that
you
might
see
him.
this
man
in
his
50s.
he
does
not
work
harder
than
other
people.
he
does
not
take
other
than
normal
breaks.
the
only
thing
he
really
does
that's
any
different
is
to
work
the
full
working
day.
that's
really
all
he
does
different.
for
the
union
to
advance
these
various
other
justifications
for
the
rule,
is
really
beside
the
point
here.
i
think
something
should
be
said
about
the
voluntary
membership
concept.
this
is
an
area
where
there
is
a
great
divergence
between
theory
and
practice.
voluntary
membership
sounds
fine
in
the
law
review
article.
in
the
industrial
plant
the
membership
is
not
quite
so
voluntary
hence
you
might
think
tremendous
pressures
of
every
kind
for
people
to
join
the
union.
and
once
they
are
in
tremendous
pressures
to
stay
in,
mr.
scofield
for
example
attempted
to
resign
in
1959
over
this
very
issue.
he
didn't
like
the
production
ceiling.
he
tried
to
resign.
he
turned
in
his
union
card.
the
union
wouldn't
take
it.
he
was
summoned
in
and
there
was
discussion
with
i
believe
11
members
of
the
union
–
mr.
james
urdan
no
it
is
not.
i
am
merely
trying
to
illustrate
that
the
voluntary
membership
question
is
a
matter
of
a
practical
problem
it
should
not
be
approached
in
any
theoretical
way.
i
think
that
congress
recognize
this.
legislative
hearings
brought
out
this
type
of
problem.
many
people
are
union
members
not
because
they
like
it
but
simply
because
of
the
pressures
in
their
work
situation
and
furthermore
they
are
required
to
pay
dues
to
this
union
whether
they
want
to
or
not
and
they
are
represented
by
this
union
whether
they
want
the
union
or
not.
this
the
law
provides,
so
the
voluntariness
i
think
is
really
not
a
true
characterization
of
this
relationship
and
that
is
precisely
why
congress
extended
these
benefits
to
union
members,
the
same
as
non-members
because
congress
knew
that
the
member
needed
this
protection,
that
is
precisely
what
the
debate
reveals.
i'd
like
to
say
one
word
about
the
effect
of
this
type
of
rule
or
sanction
and
the
democratic
process
within
the
union.
the
union
in
formulating
its
bargaining
position
ordinarily
would
have
to
take
cognizance
of
the
views
of
all
the
members.
if
a
--
even
where
a
majority
has
one
opinion
in
a
legislative
type
of
body,
must
also
consider
the
minority
opinion
and
the
minority
opinions
have
influence.
where
you
have
voluntary
unionism,
where
you
have
voluntary
adherence
to
union
rules
then
the
union
has
some
pressure
to
accommodate
competing
view
points
within
the
union.
when
you
permit
the
union
to
impose
fines,
you
lose
that
all
important
element
of
giving
these
men
a
voice
in
what
goes
on.
what
happens
the
union
leadership
can
impose
the
fine,
the
suppress
dissent,
they
suppress
the
right
of
the
individual,
they
don't
have
to
worry
what
he
thinks
anymore,
consequently
the
opinion
or
the
role
of
these
men
in
establishing
the
union
policy
is
simply
suppressed.
a
union
member
needs
protection
from
his
organization
just
the
same
as
the
man
in
the
police
station
needs
protection
from
the
police
or
the
other
decisions
of
this
court
which
have
highlighted
the
conflict,
the
difficult
position
the
individual
is
in
when
he
is
faced
by
what
is
really
an
overwhelming
organization.
the
employee
needs
protection
from
coercion.
he
needs
protection
from
coercion
from
the
employer.
he
needs
protection
from
coercion
by
his
union.
here
the
union
has
coerced
him
by
the
fine.
the
fine
is
collectable
in
court
under
the
law
of
the
state
where
this
occurred,
the
employee
is
going
to
be
defenseless
against
this
collection.
his
rights
under
the
statute
have
been
infringed
and
he
should
be
granted
relief.
mr.
james
urdan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
review
of
a
decree
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
an
order
of
the
labor
board
which
had
dismissed
unfair
labor
practice
charges
against
a
labor
union.
the
case
raises
the
issue
of
whether
it
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
section
8(b)(1)(a)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
when
a
labor
union
finds
one
of
its
members
for
exceeding
a
production
quota,
so
called
‘ceiling’
set
by
the
union.
these
petitioners
are
employees
of
the
wisconsin
motor
corporation
and
--
mr.
james
urdan
the
subject
of
the
ceilings
was
bargained
from
time-to-time.
mr.
james
urdan
they
were
not
agreed
upon
in
the
sense
that
they
were
a
limit
on
the
employee.
the
employee
was
free
to
work,
free
to
make
more
than
the
ceiling
permitted
and
the
employer
had
to
pay
him
under
the
collective
agreement.
there
was
collective
bargaining
over
the
ceilings
as
to
the
general
level
of
the
ceilings,
but
never
were
the
ceilings
accepted
in
bargaining
as
a
limit
on
the
individual
and
as
the
individual
who
is
complaining
here.
mr.
james
urdan
i
think
there's
some
truth
in
both
positions.
from
the
standpoint
of
the
employees
who
are
complaining
here,
the
case
we
have
is
that
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
was
entered
into.
this
union
bargained
it
and
agreed
with
the
employer
and
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
set
no
limit
on
the
production
or
on
the
earnings
of
these
men.
they
could
produce
to
their
capacity,
they
could
claim
pay
for
that
work
and
they
would
have
to
be
paid
for
that
work.
that
is
the
bargain
that
the
union
made
with
the
employer.
now
it
is
true
that
the
employer
and
the
union
bargained
from
time-to-time
about
the
level
of
ceilings,
because
the
employer
recognized
this
is
as
a
fact
of
life
in
the
plant.
he
recognized
that
the
union
had
these
ceilings.
the
employer
recognized
that
it
was
in
his
interest
to
have
the
ceilings
increased
from
time-to-time
and
he
bargained
for
that
objective.
he
tried
to
get
the
ceilings
removed,
not
totally
successfully.
the
union
tried
to
get
the
employer
to
agree
to
the
ceilings
and
they
failed
in
that.
the
employer
never
agreed
to
put
a
ceiling
on
the
earnings
of
these
men.
we
have
in
essence
a
standoff
in
the
bargaining.
neither
side
got
what
it
wanted,
but
as
far
as
these
employees
are
concerned,
they
worked
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
permitted
them
to
exceed
the
ceiling,
to
earn
more
and
to
collect
their
pay
and
the
employer
had
to
pay
them,
employer
could
not
refuse
to
pay
them.
this
is
their
complaint
that
the
union
fine
is
bypassing
the
collective
agreement
and
the
collective
bargaining
process.
mr.
james
urdan
the
collective
bargaining
did
not
establish
ceilings.
the
collective
bargaining
provided
pay
rates
and
pay
ranges
and
if
a
man
worked
on
piecework
and
he
produced
more
pieces,
he
would
be
paid
for
whatever
he
produced
and
that
is
all
that
is
in
the
collective
bargaining.
mr.
james
urdan
the
incentive
pay
started
from
the
beginning,
but
there
were
certain
guarantees
in
the
contract.
it
was
incentive
pay
all
the
way
--
mr.
james
urdan
the
pay
is
computed
on
the
actual
production
starting
with
the
first
unit.
the
incentive
pay
follows
all
the
way
through.
however,
a
man
is
guaranteed
certain
rate
if
his
production
does
not
come
up
to
certain
minimum
standards,
in
that
sense
you
might
say
that
the
incentive
rates
starts
at
this
point
of
guarantee.
mr.
james
urdan
the
guarantee
is
generally
in
terms
of
an
hourly
rate
--
mr.
james
urdan
i
would
say
that
is
not
the
way
it
works.
mr.
james
urdan
there
is
not
a
ceiling
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
there
is
an
incentive
pay
plan
where
the
man
is
paid
for
the
units
that
he
produces.
now
the
union
has
set
a
maximum
on
the
pay
that
they
want
the
man
to
earn.
they
say
only
produce
that
many
units
that
will
get
you
up
to
that
pay
level,
using
the
process
of
division
as
you
just
described
it.
that
is
what
the
union
says
the
man
should
do,
and
that
is
so
called
‘ceiling.'
that
is
not
reflected
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
as
such.
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
establishes
the
rates
for
the
units.
mr.
james
urdan
no,
it
is
a
higher
rate.
mr.
james
urdan
it
exceeds
the
minimum
guaranteed
rate.
but
there's
no
ceiling
and
there's
no
limit
in
the
agreement
as
such.
the
agreement
says
the
man
is
to
work
eight
hours
a
day.
whatever
he
produces
he
will
be
paid
for.
the
effect
of
the
ceiling
as
shown
very
clearly
by
the
record
is
that
the
man
does
not
work
eight
hours
a
day.
he's
any
kind
of
worker
at
all,
he
finishes
his
work
much
more
quickly.
he
has
no
need
to
abide
by
the
agreement
to
work
his
eight
hours.
mr.
james
urdan
i
think
we
are
very
close,
we
are
very
close
to
this
line.
we
--
mr.
james
urdan
this
could
be
possible.
this
issue
has
not
been
tested
because
the
employer
apparently
has
not
made
an
issue
of
it.
mr.
james
urdan
when
you
say
breaching
the
contract,
i
think
we
are
getting
at
a
concept
of
what
the
employer
is
entitled
to.
employer
is
entitled
to
have
the
man
perform
a
fair
day's
work.
mr.
james
urdan
not
that
language,
however
the
contract
does
set
shifts
and
i
think
it
is
recognized
that
-–
mr.
james
urdan
absolutely
not.
mr.
james
urdan
this
not
our
position.
mr.
james
urdan
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
urdan
we
represent
the
employees.
mr.
james
urdan
we
represent
the
individuals.
the
employer
has
not
participated
or
raised
any
complaint
in
this
proceeding.
mr.
james
urdan
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
in
an
employment
--
mr.
james
urdan
an
agreement
to
limit
production,
which
is
negotiated
with
an
employer
and
which
is
incorporated
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
protected.
an
agreement
to
limit
production,
which
is
not
negotiated,
is
not
protected
and
there
are
numerous
cases
on
this
general
subject
that
are
in
our
brief
as
far
as
the
employer
--
mr.
james
urdan
well
i
tend
to
agree
with
that.
i
think
the
employer
here
has
never
raised
this
issue.
i
don't
contend
that
it
is
a
breach
of
contract,
nor
do
i
consider
that
this
is
in
anyway
essential
to
the
case
of
these
petitioners.
mr.
james
urdan
that
is
the
way
the
process
works.
mr.
james
urdan
the
employer
has
accepted
this
as
a
procedure
--
mr.
james
urdan
no
the
employee
keeps
his
own
records
of
his
bank.
mr.
james
urdan
i
would
say
he
does
not.
the
employer
pays
--
mr.
james
urdan
he
pays
for
the
production
that
is
reported.
if
the
employee
doesn't
report
it,
the
employer
generally
doesn't
know
about
it.
mr.
james
urdan
the
employer
generally
did
not
have
records
as
to
when
the
actual
production
took
place.
mr.
james
urdan
the
employer
paid
as
the
work
was
reported
for
pay.
mr.
james
urdan
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
urdan
the
record
is
quite
confused
on
his
point,
but
the
picture
that
comes
out
is
that
the
employer
does
not
reconcile
the
pieces
flowing
through
with
the
pay
records.
employer
knows
the
banking
is
going
on,
but
does
not
reconcile
--
mr.
james
urdan
i
think
this
is
a
very
pertinent
question.
it
has
some
humor
in
it.
the
suggestion
is
made
in
the
record
that
this
practice
benefits
the
company.
this
is
not
correct
and
the
company
has
had
very
definite
difficulties
from
this
practice.
i
think
we
are
concerned
here
with
reconciling
two
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
within
the
last
two
years.
in
allis-chalmers
case,
we
had
the
question
of
a
union
fine
against
a
member
for
crossing
a
picket
line
and
working
during
a
strike,
a
question
of
whether
that
violated
section
8(b)(1)(a).
more
recently,
in
the
marine
and
ship
building
workers
case,
there
was
a
question
of
expulsion
of
a
member
for
having
filed
charges
with
the
nlrb.
in
the
allis-chalmers
decision,
the
holding
was
that
there
was
not
a
violation
of
the
statute.
in
the
marine
and
ship
building
workers
case
there
was
a
holding
that
the
statute
had
been
violated,
both
cases
involving
union
discipline.
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
two
cases,
we
find
two
questions
that
the
court
is
asking.
what
is
the
union
objective?
what
are
they
trying
to
accomplish?
how
does
their
objective
comport
with
the
policies
of
the
act?
secondly,
what
is
the
method
the
union
is
using?
is
the
method
one
that
conforms
with
the
policies
of
the
act?
now
looking
first
at
the
union
objective,
i
think
we
have
a
case
much
closer
to
the
marine
and
ship
building
workers
and
to
allis-chalmers.
allis-chalmers
involves
an
economic
strike.
union
was
trying
to
sustain
and
support
that
economic
strike.
this
is
an
activity
that
has
the
highest
degree
of
protection
under
the
act.
in
marine
and
ship
building
by
contrast,
the
union
was
trying
to
restrict
the
access
of
the
employee
to
the
processes
of
the
board,
a
very
important
policy
was
being
offended.
now
here
the
union
objective
is
simply
to
have
more
men
on
the
job
than
the
job
requires.
it's
a
matter
of
degree
on
this
question
of
how
men
it
takes
to
do
the
work.
in
an
extreme
case,
where
you
ask
for
pay
for
men
who
aren't
even
there,
we
have
an
explicit
unfair
labor
practice
under
the
act.
there
are
lesser
forms
of
this
type
of
production
restriction.
they
are
not
unfair
labor
practices,
but
they
are
not
even
protected
activities
under
the
act.
if
the
employer
sought
to
discipline
the
employee
for
this
type
of
restriction,
the
employer
could.
in
fact,
the
union
concedes
this
very
point
in
its
brief.
we
have
here
--
mr.
james
urdan
it
is
not
for
not
trying
to
make
more
pay
--
mr.
james
urdan
a
restriction
on
production
by
slow
down,
similar
methods
has
been
found
to
be
unprotected
activity
under
the
act,
such
that
the
employer
may
lawfully
discipline
the
employee
for
engaging
in
such
an
activity.
mr.
james
urdan
in
this
case,
the
people
who
are
engaging
in
ceiling
practices
to
the
point
of
not
performing
their
work,
as
the
record
shows,
stopping
work
an
hour
or
two
early
and
reading
magazine
--
mr.
james
urdan
they
completed
their
–-
mr.
james
urdan
i
am
saying
so
far
as
the
act
is
concerned,
this
is
an
unprotected
activity.
now
whether
the
employer
could
enforce
a
discharge
in
this
case
is
a
question
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement;
and
if
the
employer
attempted
to
discipline
an
employee
in
this
type
of
situation,
he
would
be
faced
with
the
defenses
and
arguments
that
he
had
acquiesced
to
this,
he
had
bargained
the
ceiling,
he
had
accepted
the
ceiling,
therefore
he,
this
employer
could
not
enforce
discipline,
but
this
would
not
flow
from
the
act
and
neither
would
this
be
a
protected
activity
under
the
act.
this
would
be
a
question
of
the
contractual
limitation
on
--
mr.
james
urdan
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
also
provides
restrictions
on
discipline.
discipline
must
be
for
just
cause,
this
is
the
customary
standard.
mr.
james
urdan
if
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
established
the
ceiling
and
said
you
cannot
collect
more
pay
no
matter
what
you
produce
--
mr.
james
urdan
very
definitely.
if
the
agreement
permitted
them
to
work
for
and
earn
more
than
that
is
what
they
should
be
permitted
to
do.
mr.
james
urdan
union
cannot
make
a
bargain
with
the
employer
and
then
pull
it
away
by
its
fine?
mr.
james
urdan
i
can
only
say
that
would
be
a
very
remarkable
contract.
i
don't
think
the
subject
--
mr.
james
urdan
i
think
this
is
the
point
raised
in
the
brief
of
the
amicus
here,
that
the
question
of
whether
the
union
has
a
rule
that
can
be
enforced
should
not
be
part
of
the
bargaining
process.
the
bargaining
process
should
not
get
itself
lost
in
this
maze
of
having
the
employer
looking
into
the
union
disciplinary
process,
deciding
which
union
rules
he
likes,
and
which
he
doesn't,
and
which
should
go
in
the
contract
and
which
shouldn't.
this
should
be
insulated
from
the
collective
bargaining
process.
the
employer
makes
an
agreement
here
that
says
the
man
can
be
paid
for
what
he
produces,
that
is
the
deal
the
union
agreed
to.
these
men
tried
to
produce
just
as
the
agreement
tells
them
they
may
do
then
the
union
finds
them.
it
takes
away
the
bargain
that
it
made
itself.
now
this
is
a
very
dangerous
precedent
for
the
collective
bargaining
process.
collective
bargaining
process
is
the
heart
of
this
act.
the
whole
concept
of
the
act
is
that
the
party
should
sit
down,
reason
together,
attempt
to
resolve
their
differences.
and
when
you
permit
the
union
to
accomplish
its
objectives
by
finding
its
members,
not
by
collective
bargaining
then
the
whole
process
has
been
weakened.
the
fruit
of
the
bargaining,
the
agreement
has
no
meaning
if
the
man
can't
take
advantage
of
it.
certainly
we
are
not
within
the
realm
of
internal
union
affairs
as
that
concept
is
used
in
the
allis-chalmers'
case.
it's
no
longer
an
internal
matter
when
you
tell
the
man
he
cannot
earn
the
money
that
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
provides;
this
is
the
very
heart
of
the
wage
and
employment
relationship.
mr.
james
urdan
that
is
correct.
the
statute
protects
the
union
member
just
as
much
as
the
non-member.
i
think
the
marine
&
shipbuilding
case
of
course
is
the
example
of
this.
the
union
member
has
the
same
protection.
congress
did
not
make
any
distinction
between
the
members
and
the
non-members.
there
are
many
cases
that
have
pointed
this
out,
radio
officers'
and
teamsters'
case
of
1954
setting
forth
this
basic
ground
rule
that
a
man
can
be
a
good,
bad
or
indifferent
union
member.
he
only
has
to
pay
his
dues,
that
is
the
price
of
admission.
there
is
a
quote
from
senator
taft
which
appears
in
the
footnote
of
the
allis-chalmers
decision
which
reads
right
on
this
subject.
senator
taft
said,
“'(m)erely
to
require
that
unions
be
subject
to
the
same
rules
that
govern
employers,
and
that
they
do
not
have
the
right
to
interfere
with
or
coerce
employees,
either
their
own
members
or
those
outside
the
union,
is
such
a
clear
matter,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
so
easy
to
determine,
that
i
would
hope
we
would
all
agree.”
the
act
applies
equally
to
the
member
and
to
the
non-member.
this
is
established.
in
this
connection,
i
think
we
should
look
at
the
proviso
to
section
8(b)(1)(a),
so
i
think
the
proviso
has
been
badly
misconstrued.
i
think
the
purpose
of
the
proviso
has
been
misunderstood.
the
proviso
says
that
the
union
may
establish
rules
with
respect
to
acquisition
and
retention
of
membership.
this
has
been
looked
at
in
the
context
of
these
fine
cases
as
a
guarantee
that
the
union
can
control
its
members.
this
was
not
the
purpose
of
the
proviso
and
nothing
to
do
with
control
of
members.
the
purpose
of
the
proviso
was
to
permit
unions
to
decide
who
their
members
shall
be,
not
to
tell
the
member
what
to
do,
but
to
decide
who
the
member
shall
be
was
a
concept
of
freedom
of
association.
the
union
can
decide
who
will
participate.
there
is
traces
from
the
debate
that
went
on
in
congress
preceding
the
introduction
of
section
8(b)(1)(a).
it
was
a
great
issue
in
the
congressional
debates
as
to
the
closed
shop.
there
is
a
lot
of
public
concern
about
this
issue.
the
idea
that
the
man
had
to
belong
to
the
union
in
order
to
hold
a
job.
the
choice
that
was
presented
to
the
congress
either
open
up
the
union
or
open
up
the
job.
there
were
strong
advocates
of
the
position
that
the
union
should
be
open
that
every
man
should
have
right
to
join
the
union.
now
this
issue
was
debated
and
the
unions
didn't
like
that
idea
and
a
number
of
senators,
particularly
from
the
south
did
not
like
the
idea
that
the
union
should
be
open
because
they
had
segregated
unions,
and
these
very
issues
were
debated
explicitly
and
so
the
decision
was
reached,
you
don't
have
to
have
an
open
union.
you
don't
have
to
let
people
in
if
you
don't
want
to.
instead
we'll
have
the
open
shot
or
the
open
job
or
you
don't
have
to
be
a
member.
now
this
was
the
background
when
section
8(b)(1)(a)
was
introduced.
section
8(b)(1)(a)
says
you
cannot
coerce
a
member,
you
cannot
coerce
an
employee
in
the
exercise
of
his
rights
under
section
7.
one
of
those
rights
being
the
right
to
participate
in
union
activities.
now
the
opponents
of
the
open
union
became
very
concerned
again.
they
said
is
this
going
to
open
up
the
union?
is
it
going
to
be
considered
restraint
or
coercion
when
we
segregate
or
keep
people
out
of
the
union
and
that
is
why
the
proviso
was
introduced.
it
was
to
confirm
this
concept
that
the
union
didn't
have
to
be
open.
the
proviso
was
introduced
simply
to
confirm
the
commitments
that
had
been
made
in
this
debate
on
the
closed
shop.
it
is
not
in
any
sense
a
grant
of
authority
to
control
the
actions
of
the
members,
rather
it
is
to
guarantee
to
the
union
that
it
can
control
its
own
membership
and
who
will
participate
within
the
union.
now,
the
proviso
to
8(b)(1)(a)
is
not
a
grant
of
authority
to
discipline.
now,
we
have
also
in
this
case
a
jurisdictional
issue.
i'd
like
to
devote
a
few
minutes
to
that.
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
within
90
days
of
the
decree
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
question
has
been
raised
whether
the
90-day
period
should
run
from
the
date
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
an
order
that
was
entered
that
same
day.
i
think
reviewing
the
record
it
will
be
perfectly
clear
that
the
intention
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
the
decree
of
april
16th
was
the
decree
in
the
case.
the
statute
starts
the
90-day
period
running
from
the
date
of
entry
of
the
judgment
or
decree.
it
doesn't
say
the
date
of
the
opinion,
it
doesn't
say
the
date
of
the
decision,
it
doesn't
say
the
date
of
the
resolution
of
the
case.
it
says
the
date
of
entry
of
the
judgment
or
decree.
now
after
the
opinion
of
the
court
on
march
5th,
the
board
itself
sent
a
proposed
decree
to
the
court
and
the
board
in
its
letter
to
the
court
said
after
entry
of
the
decree
please
send
us
a
copy.
the
board
acknowledged
that
there
had
been
no
decree
at
that
point.
subsequently,
the
court
entered
the
decree
and
the
clerk
of
the
court
wrote
to
all
the
parties
enclosing
a
certified
copy,
“copy
of
the
final
decree
entered
by
this
court
on
april
16,
1968.”
i
think
it's
perfectly
clear
what
the
court
intended.
april
16th
decree
was
the
decree
in
the
case
and
the
petition
was
filed
within
90
days
thereafter.
mr.
james
urdan
there
is
no
difference
in
substance.
there
is
a
difference
in
form.
the
order
of
march
5,
for
example
is
entered
by
the
clerk,
the
decree
is
signed
by
the
judges.
the
order
of
march
5
is
in
form
tentative.
it
says
by
its
own
terms
upon
presentation
an
appropriate
decree
will
be
entered.
it
is
in
form
a
tentative
order.
it
was
entered
by
the
clerk
without
any
notice
to
the
parties.
the
order
of
march
5
was
not
communicated
to
the
parties
and
apparently
the
board
didn't
know
about
it,
because
it
is
sent
along
a
proposed
decree
some
weeks
later,
without
even
mentioning
the
prior
order
nor
does
the
decree
mention
the
prior
order.
the
rule
of
the
court
provided
for
entry
of
decrees
following
settlement
and
that
is
what
was
done
here.
there
is
also
a
rule
of
the
court
providing
for
entry
of
judgment
on
the
decision
day,
but
the
court
quite
obviously
by
this
set
of
circumstances
was
not
following
that
prior
rule.
the
court
was
not
purporting
to
enter
its
judgment.
i
think
the
cases
as
set
forth
in
our
brief
establish
that
it
is
the
intention
of
the
court
that
must
be
given
effect.
when
did
the
court
intend
that
this
decree
be
entered?
and
that
is
perfectly
clearly
april
the
16th.
mr.
james
urdan
i'd
like
to
comment
first
on
the
last
two
points
made
by
counsel
for
the
union.
the
union
position
asserts
section
8(b)(1)(a)
is
violated
when
you
also
violate
section
8(b)(2),
(3)
or
(4)
or
(5)
or
(6).
we
cannot
accept
this
reading
of
this
statute.
8(b)(1)(a)
has
a
purpose
of
its
own
and
it's
been
found
to
be
violated
without
also
involving
other
sections
of
section
8(b).
the
suggestion
that
the
employees
have
a
remedy
in
the
common
law
courts
is
perhaps
generous,
but
not
very
helpful.
wisconsin
courts
have
said
that
the
union
fine
is
collectable.
they've
said
this
on
the
basis
of
the
allis-chalmers
decision.
they
have
also
said
that
even
a
contrary
state
policy
can't
be
enforced.
they
say
because
of
the
allis-chalmers
rational
we
can't
even
apply
our
own
wisconsin
law.
we
have
to
permit
collection
of
the
fine.
these
employees
are
not
going
to
get
much
relief
from
the
wisconsin
supreme
court.
now
the
contention
is
made
that
this
a
reasonable
rule
and
i
think
the
record
shows
that
it
is
not
a
reasonable
rule.
employees
do
not
put
in
a
normal
working
day
until
the
company
attempted
to
impose
some
restrictions,
there
was
card
playing,
reading
of
magazines,
it
didn't
look
like
an
industrial
plant.
the
president
of
the
company
testified
at
the
hearing
that
he
was
ashamed,
the
president
was
ashamed
to
take
visitors
into
the
plant
after
lunch
because
the
man
aren't
working.
you
get
these
unreasonable
results
when
you
permit
unreasonable
coercion,
that's
precisely
why
coercion
is
outlawed
by
congress.
when
you
permit
coercion,
the
union
doesn't
have
to
worry
whether
it's
a
reasonable
rule
or
not.
they
just
go
ahead
and
enforce
it.
the
union
says
its
legitimate
interests
are
involved
and
certainly
there
is
a
legitimate
interest
in
negotiating
workloads
and
matters
of
this
sort,
but
the
question
of
the
legitimate
interest
includes
the
method
that
is
used
to
attain
the
objective
just
because
it's
a
worthy
objective
would
not
permit
an
impermissible
method
and
this
method
is
coercive.
mr.
james
urdan
this
would
be
the
proper
way
for
the
employer
to
proceed.
we
don't
have
to
come
here
speaking
for
the
employer,
we
speak
for
the
man
who
are
working
under
a
contract
that
doesn't
say
that.
the
contract
says
they'll
be
paid
for
the
work
they
produce,
the
union
is
trying
to
prevent
them
from
doing
that.
you
are
perfectly
correct
that
the
employer
has
his
remedy
in
collective
bargaining.
these
employees
do
not.
now
the
union
tells
us
that
the
rule
here
is
not
a
production
restriction
as
such.
they
cite
various
text
writers
who
to
tell
the
reasons
why
incentive
pay
is
objectionable.
these
texts
are
interesting,
but
that
isn't
what
the
union
witnesses
said
at
the
hearing.
the
union,
one
of
the
founders
of
the
union
and
the
man
who
was
intimately
involved
in
the
creation
of
the
ceiling
testified
at
the
hearing,
this
is
at
page
45
of
the
appendix.
we
wanted
to
see
that
this
labor
state
keep
as
many
fellows
working
as
we
possibly
could
and
we
know
if
we
put
this
thing
on
there
it
would
provide
for
at
least
a
few
more
fellows
to
stay
at
work.
and
he
says
the
fellows
are
for
this
ceiling
because
it
provides
jobs.
then
he
went
on.
he
was
asked
what
would
happen
if
they
took
the
ceiling
off.
he
didn't
say
there
would
be
jealousies,
he
didn't
say
the
older
workers
would
be
prejudiced,
he
didn't
recite
any
of
these
reasons
[inaudible]
now
advances.
he
says,
if
the
ceiling
were
taken
off,
it
would
mean
a
loss
of
jobs.
that
is
what
the
union
was
trying
to
accomplish,
having
more
men
at
work
than
were
required.
now
the
union
doesn't
need
this
power.
this
is
not
like
the
allis-chalmers
case
where
you
have
no
way
to
prevent
a
man
from
going
to
work
during
the
strike.
in
the
allis-chalmers
case
there
is
no
contract
in
existence.
the
union
has
no
effective
remedy.
they
have
no
way
of
stopping
the
man.
sometimes
they
tried
to
stop
them
physically.
other
than
that
there
is
no
way
to
accomplish
their
objective.
well
that's
not
true
here.
mr.
james
urdan
i
might
say
first
we
certainly
don't
agree
with
the
allis-chalmers
decision.
i
think
the
dissenting
opinion
makes
considerably
more
sense
to
us
on
our
side.
mr.
james
urdan
that's
exactly
right
and
i
think
this
is
a
great
evil
of
the
allis-chalmers
decision,
and
a
great
evil
of
the
union
position
here
that
it
puts
the
employee
in
the
middle.
union
brief
says,
should
an
employer
refuse
to
produce
a
fair
day's
work
under
a
union
pay
ceiling
the
employer
is
free
to
discipline
or
discharge
the
worker.
mr.
james
urdan
there
are
two
very
important
distinctions
from
the
allis-chalmers
case.
the
first
the
purpose
of
the
union
rule,
what
is
it
that
the
union
is
trying
to
accomplish?
secondly
does
the
method
used
by
the
union
confirm
with
the
statutory
policy.
in
the
allis-chalmers
case,
the
strike
was
considered
to
be
so
important,
the
union
had
no
other
method
other
than
violence
for
accomplishing
its
objective.
here
the
union
has
no
such
need.
it
can
accomplish
its
objective
by
collective
bargaining
and
that
is
precisely
what
the
act
envisions.
this
is
how
the
union
should
resolve
questions
of
pay
and
production
loads.
mr.
scofield
is
not
a
young
man,
he
is
not
an
eager
beaver.
i
wish
he
were
here
in
the
court
room,
so
that
you
might
see
him.
this
man
in
his
50s.
he
does
not
work
harder
than
other
people.
he
does
not
take
other
than
normal
breaks.
the
only
thing
he
really
does
that's
any
different
is
to
work
the
full
working
day.
that's
really
all
he
does
different.
for
the
union
to
advance
these
various
other
justifications
for
the
rule,
is
really
beside
the
point
here.
i
think
something
should
be
said
about
the
voluntary
membership
concept.
this
is
an
area
where
there
is
a
great
divergence
between
theory
and
practice.
voluntary
membership
sounds
fine
in
the
law
review
article.
in
the
industrial
plant
the
membership
is
not
quite
so
voluntary
hence
you
might
think
tremendous
pressures
of
every
kind
for
people
to
join
the
union.
and
once
they
are
in
tremendous
pressures
to
stay
in,
mr.
scofield
for
example
attempted
to
resign
in
1959
over
this
very
issue.
he
didn't
like
the
production
ceiling.
he
tried
to
resign.
he
turned
in
his
union
card.
the
union
wouldn't
take
it.
he
was
summoned
in
and
there
was
discussion
with
i
believe
11
members
of
the
union
–
mr.
james
urdan
no
it
is
not.
i
am
merely
trying
to
illustrate
that
the
voluntary
membership
question
is
a
matter
of
a
practical
problem
it
should
not
be
approached
in
any
theoretical
way.
i
think
that
congress
recognize
this.
legislative
hearings
brought
out
this
type
of
problem.
many
people
are
union
members
not
because
they
like
it
but
simply
because
of
the
pressures
in
their
work
situation
and
furthermore
they
are
required
to
pay
dues
to
this
union
whether
they
want
to
or
not
and
they
are
represented
by
this
union
whether
they
want
the
union
or
not.
this
the
law
provides,
so
the
voluntariness
i
think
is
really
not
a
true
characterization
of
this
relationship
and
that
is
precisely
why
congress
extended
these
benefits
to
union
members,
the
same
as
non-members
because
congress
knew
that
the
member
needed
this
protection,
that
is
precisely
what
the
debate
reveals.
i'd
like
to
say
one
word
about
the
effect
of
this
type
of
rule
or
sanction
and
the
democratic
process
within
the
union.
the
union
in
formulating
its
bargaining
position
ordinarily
would
have
to
take
cognizance
of
the
views
of
all
the
members.
if
a
--
even
where
a
majority
has
one
opinion
in
a
legislative
type
of
body,
must
also
consider
the
minority
opinion
and
the
minority
opinions
have
influence.
where
you
have
voluntary
unionism,
where
you
have
voluntary
adherence
to
union
rules
then
the
union
has
some
pressure
to
accommodate
competing
view
points
within
the
union.
when
you
permit
the
union
to
impose
fines,
you
lose
that
all
important
element
of
giving
these
men
a
voice
in
what
goes
on.
what
happens
the
union
leadership
can
impose
the
fine,
the
suppress
dissent,
they
suppress
the
right
of
the
individual,
they
don't
have
to
worry
what
he
thinks
anymore,
consequently
the
opinion
or
the
role
of
these
men
in
establishing
the
union
policy
is
simply
suppressed.
a
union
member
needs
protection
from
his
organization
just
the
same
as
the
man
in
the
police
station
needs
protection
from
the
police
or
the
other
decisions
of
this
court
which
have
highlighted
the
conflict,
the
difficult
position
the
individual
is
in
when
he
is
faced
by
what
is
really
an
overwhelming
organization.
the
employee
needs
protection
from
coercion.
he
needs
protection
from
coercion
from
the
employer.
he
needs
protection
from
coercion
by
his
union.
here
the
union
has
coerced
him
by
the
fine.
the
fine
is
collectable
in
court
under
the
law
of
the
state
where
this
occurred,
the
employee
is
going
to
be
defenseless
against
this
collection.
his
rights
under
the
statute
have
been
infringed
and
he
should
be
granted
relief.
