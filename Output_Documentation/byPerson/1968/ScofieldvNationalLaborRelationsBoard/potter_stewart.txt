brennan's
question
exposes
what
for
me
has
been
a
difficulty
in
reading
the
briefs
and
to
answer
this
argument
and
that
is
the
apparent
disagreement
among
the
parties
as
to
what
the
facts
are.
you
state
as
number
one
on
the
questions
presented,
referring
to
the
ceilings,
you
talk
about
production
quotas
established
and
enforced
by
the
union
and
the
government
trying
to
persuade
us
that
really
these
things,
while
not
explicitly
written
out
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
are
nonetheless
where
by
custom,
practice
and
basic
recognition
were
part
and
parcel
of
the
agreement
between
the
union
and
the
employer
and
that
makes
for
two
quite
different
cases.
i'm
interested
in
knowing
which
case
do
we
have
before
us?

the
statement.

question.
you

the

to
this

what
do
you

the
employees
could
be
fired?
