but
you
are
not
suggesting
that
the
union
action
is
in
breach
of
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
not
suggesting
that
an
employee
who
is
also
bound
by
the
contract
who
works
only
enough
to
earn
again
the
minimum
and
who
never
attempts
to
earn
anymore
is
breaching
the
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
find
that
in
the
contract
anywhere?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
are
you
willing
to
put
your
case
on
whether
or
not
there
is
breach
of
contract
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
wouldn't
think
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
your
employer,
your
people
are
because
you
are
attempting
to
earn
incentive
pay,
but
the
employee
who
doesn't
attempt
to
earn
incentive
pay
you
are
suggesting
might
be
in
breach
of
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
would
you
say
that
10
employees
all
of
them
get
together
and
say
we
don't
want
to
earn
any
incentive
pay,
and
that's
all
agreed
that
we
won't
earn
any
incentive
pay,
you
say
that
isn't
protected
by
such
section
7?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
with
that
but
then
here
there
has
been
negotiated
with
an
employer
a
scale
of
pay
depending
upon
your
effort
and
i
doubt
if
an
employer
could
just
fire
an
employee
under
this
contract
for
earning
only
the
minimum
pay?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
(inaudible).
justice
byron

white
this
is
just
standard
practice
related.
did
it
ever
occur
that
this
–
of
the
decisions
within
the
rainy
days
of
that
order?
justice

you
raised
the
point
before.

where
the

where
the

machine
rate,
he
still
should
--
must
stay
on
the
job.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
this
maybe
so
but
they
signed
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
the
plan
in
it,
didn't
they?
justice
byron

white
does
the
employee
have
to
not
work
--
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
come
in
responding
to
that
question,
you
don't
think
that
the
question
between
the
union
and
the
employee
would
remain
the
same
in
those
two
cases.
if
there
was
a
-–
it's
a
straight
eight-hour
day
and
the
union
could
have
put
someone
under
ceiling
on
that.
it
may
be
that
every
employee
would
get
fired
if
he
lived
up
to
the
union
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
here
you
say
and
your
position
is
that
that
the
rule
the
employee
obeys
it
isn't
a
breach
of
contract
and
that
the
union
and
the
employee
couldn't
get
fired
for
it.
but
would
do
that
change
the
legal
position
of
the
union
vis-à-vis
the
member
of
the
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
union
might
be
in
breach
of
contract
in
an
eight-hour
day
case
itself
with
a
rule
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
employees
here
though
do
have
a
--
are
beneficiary
to
this
contract
or
parties
to
it
and
they
do
have
a
contractual
right
against
the
employer
to
take
advantage
of
the
incentive
plan
and
to
be
paid
and
to
collect
their
money
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
when
they
work
and
say
pay
me,
the
employer
must
pay
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
right
the
union
and
this
union
bylaw
certainly
interferes
with
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
conceding
that
though
the
there
still
is
the
fact
that
the
union
by
law
does
interfere
with
the
contractual
rights
of
the
employee
against
the
employer.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i'm
not
saying
it
that
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
what
i'm
saying.
i
didn't
attach
any
consequences
to
it.
i
just
wanted
to
know
doesn't
this
union
bylaw
interfere
at
the
point
it
becomes
operative
with
what
the
--
with
an
accumulated
--
with
a
vested
right
that
the
employee
has
against
the
employer?
justice
byron
r.
white
he's
worked
above
the
ceiling,
he's
entitled
to
be
paid
and
the
--
and
he
can
demand
the
money
from
the
employer
and
the
union
says
you
may
not
collect
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no
i
don't
suggest
there
is
any
breach
of
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
isn't
the
point
i'm
making,
you're
just
not
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
communicating.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
what
i
said.
i
said
that
let's
assume
he
does
work
over
the
ceiling
and
he
earns
some
money
and
the
employer
owes
it
to
him
and
the
union
--
justice
byron
r.
white
he
may
not
though,
without
breaking
the
union
bylaw.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
these
union
members
collected
their
money
and
worked
over
the
ceiling,
asked
the
employer
to
be
paid
now,
they
were
paid
as
they
were
entitled
to
be,
as
far
as
the
employer
was
concerned
and
the
union
filed
the
report?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
because
it's
not
restrain
or
coercion
or
because
of
the
proviso?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
route
are
you
taking
to
get
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
isn't
that
an
ample
answer
to
the
employer
if
he
really
thinks
the
doing
only
the
machine
rate
is
not
a
decent
day's
work,
to
suggest
that
he
negotiate
a
different
level
of
what
a
satisfactory
day's
work
is
and
put
it
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
the
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
in
allis-chalmers
the
employer
invites
workers
back
and
will
take
them
back
and
pay
them
if
they
come
to
work,
when
an
employee
says
i
want
to
come
to
work,
and
if
he
does,
and
the
union
fines
him.
do
you
just
--
really
think
that's
different?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
further
more
in
allis-chalmers
if
the
employee
obeyed
the
rule
and
stayed
away
it
might
very
well
be,
that
he
wouldn't
have
a
job,
because
he
might
be
permanently
replaced?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
but
given
how
allis-chalmers,
what
about
this
case?
aren't
you
really
in
some
difficulty?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
are
not
suggesting
that
the
union
action
is
in
breach
of
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
not
suggesting
that
an
employee
who

bound

never

is
breaching
the
contract?
justice
byron

white
well,
do
you
find
that
in
the
contract
anywhere?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
are
you
willing
to
put
your
case
on
whether
or
not
there
is
breach
of
contract
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
wouldn't
think
so.
justice
byron

white
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
your
employer,
your
people
are
because
you
are
attempting
to
earn

pay,
but
the
employee
who
doesn't
attempt
to
earn
incentive
pay
you
are
suggesting
might
be
in
breach
of
contract?
justice
byron

or
would
you
say
that
10

all

change
the
