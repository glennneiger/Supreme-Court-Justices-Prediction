mr.
john
silard
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
justice
fortas
has
asked
an
interesting
question
whether
a
union
by
bylaw
could
say
to
the
worker,
the
member
violate
your
contract
and
if
it
did
so,
justice
white
suggests
the
union
maybe
violating
the
contract
and
justice
fortas
asked
whether
may
--
the
union
may
not
also
be
violating
section
8(b)(1)?
we
say
probably,
given
the
case
of
homebuilders
in
the
ninth
circuit
which
has
been
read
by
both
sides
here,
given
a
case
where
the
union
attracts
a
certain
requirement
under
the
contract
such
as
the
8
hour
day
in
an
ordinary
hourly
rate
of
plan.
and
then
the
next
day,
they
put
in
bylaw
when
the
contract
goes
into
effect
that
says
notwithstanding,
never
mind
the
contract,
no
member
of
this
union
shall
work
more
than
seven
hours.
we
are
tempted
to
say
that,
that
would
be
a
violation
of
8(b)(3)
by
means
of
fines
against
a
member.
in
other
words,
we
take
this
view
that
while
congress
protected
the
relationship
of
the
member
and
the
union
(inaudible)
from
intrusion
by
the
labor
board,
that
it
is
the
internal
disputes
of
the
kind
of
allis-charmers
in
this
case
involved.
if
by
membership
control
the
union
sought
to
violate
the
rights
of
others
that
the
statute
protects,
for
instance
the
rights
of
neutrals
under
8(b)(4)
by
requiring
a
member
to
go
on
a
secondary
boycott
picket
line
which
is
bricklayers'
case
at
page
31
of
our
brief,
we
think
that
goes
too
far.
that
the
exemption
of
section
8(b)(1)
of
union
discipline
as
under
the
board's
scrutiny
cannot
go
so
far
as
to
permit
the
union
discipline
to
becomes
a
means
for
violating
other
rights
that
the
statue
protects
--
mr.
john
silard
and
if
this
were
--
mr.
john
silard
right
your
honor
and
--
mr.
john
silard
right,
we
would
know,
i
wouldn't
say
right
your
honor
i
would
say
wrong
on
two
accounts.
if
this
where
the
case
of
a
union
by
bylaw
requiring
a
member
not
to
--
mr.
john
silard
--
live
up
to
his
contract,
we
say
that
two
distinctions
in
this
case
and
i
want
to
emphasize
they're
quite
two
--
quite
separate
reasons
why
this
bylaw
is
not
of
the
order
of
the
homebuilders'
case
where
the
union
is
asking
its
member
to
violate
the
contract,
either
rights
of
the
employer
under
the
contract,
of
the
employee
under
the
contract.
the
first
reason
is
that
they
may
not
doing
a
fair
day's
work
even
within
the
ceiling
and
therefore
the
employer
has
never
said,
and
does
not
now
say
there
is
any
idleness
in
this
plant
by
virtue
of
these
ceilings.
the
second
reason
is
that
even
if
there
were
an
issue
as
to
a
fair
day's
work,
this
employer
has
contracted
for
16
years
in
consecutive
agreements
with
the
union
as
to
the
level
of
the
ceiling.
if
the
ceiling
is
too
low
to
permit
man
to
do
a
fair
day's
work,
the
employer
is
a
party
to
the
ceiling,
because
he
has
agreed
over
and
over
again
as
to
what
the
ceiling
will
be.
mr.
john
silard
let
us
say
it
this
way.
the
union
--
mr.
john
silard
i
will
say
it
infringes
upon
the
contract
to
that
employee,
but
may
i
say
this
your
honor,
allis-chalmers
did
too.
nothing
could
more
directly
infringe
upon
the
right
of
the
unionists
in
allis-chalmers
under
the
contract,
than
the
rule,
let's
say
you
shall
not
work
at
all.
so
that
to
say
that
a
union
bylaw
touches
upon
an
area
of
employment
rights,
doesn't
have
--
mr.
john
silard
no
--
mr.
john
silard
no
your
honor,
i'd
say
that
if
they
were
contracts,
breach
of
contract
suit
brought
by
the
employer
here
to
test
the
question
--
mr.
john
silard
well,
let
me
forget
the
contracts.
i
would
say
that
under
this
contract
the
employer
as
a
matter
of
successive
contracts,
in
1953,
1956,
1965
has
agreed
that
this
system
shall
operate
as
to
--
mr.
john
silard
i'm
not
getting
it
your
honor.
mr.
john
silard
i
don't
think
there
is
a
vested
right
by
a
union
member
in
this
plant
to
work
over
the
union
ceiling,
because
we
think
the
employer
has
agreed
that
no
union
member
shall
--
mr.
john
silard
oh
he
may
collect
it
as
a
matter
of
contract
right,
of
course.
mr.
john
silard
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
may
risk
breaking
the
union
bylaw
as
these
gentlemen
have
done,
but
as
a
matter
of
contractual
right,
he
has
a
right
to
collect
all
that
he
earned
by
production
and
of
course
--
mr.
john
silard
that's
right.
may
i
say
then
to
this
court
that
the
ultimate
question
seems
to
us
to
be
what
is
the
guiding
principal
of
8(b)(1)
after
allis-chalmers
and
marine
workers.
we
say
there
are
two
tests
to
be
met
in
a
case
of
this
kind,
because
we
say
that
section
8(b)(1)
now
does
not
restrict
the
union
from
enforcing
from
discipline
a
membership
rule,
not
plainly
ultra
vires,
unless
the
rule
invades
employer
or
public
rights
elsewhere
protected
in
the
statue.
before
i
get
into
the
law,
may
i
draw
this
court's
attention
to
footnote
5
on
page
9
of
our
brief,
because
this
fair
day's
work
issue
was
bargained
out
between
the
two
sides
very
recently.
in
the
middle
of
footnote
5,
on
page
9,
we
have
the
minutes
of
the
negotiations
in
1965
when
after
contractual
negotiations
the
ceilings
were
again
raised,
at
the
employer's
insistence.
interestingly,
in
these
minutes
the
following
is
reflected.
the
union
said
the
ceiling
is
good
for
the
union
and
the
company,
if
they
remove
it,
they'd
have
confusion.
the
union
said
the
ceilings
are
$0.40
to
$0.50
per
hour
above
the
timing
rate,
that's
the
average
rate,
which
is
considered
a
fair
day's
work
if
maintained.
todd,
that's
the
company
president,
figures
that
his
claims
shows
that
the
spread
between
the
timing
rate
and
the
ceilings
has
gradually
diminished.
in
other
words,
here
are
the
parties
bargaining
precisely
on
this
question.
is
this
ceiling
set
at
a
level
where
a
fair
day's
work
is
no
longer
being
maintained?
the
company
saying,
yes,
this
is
what
has
happened,
the
union
is
saying
it
hasn't
and
they
resolved
it
by
increasing
the
ceilings
$0.03
per
hour,
so
that
the
very
issue
as
to
a
fair
day's
work
as
against
slowdown
has
been
bargained
by
these
parties
and
the
result
has
been
compromised.
we
say
therefore,
the
very
hard
case
that
justice
fortas
puts
of
a
union
rule
that
requires
a
man
to
violate
a
contract
is
simply
not
before
this
court,
in
a
double
sense
that
this
particular
arrangement
and
existence
since
1944
has
won
acquiescence,
acceptance
and
agreement
from
the
employer
as
it
applies
to
union
members,
and
that
in
any
event
even
if
it
had
not
won
that
acquiescence,
the
scheme
as
it
operates
is
not
a
production
limiting
slowdown
scheme,
men
are
doing
a
fair
day's
work
under
it.
and
to
say
that
this
is
--
may
i
just
conclude
your
honor,
it's
to
say
this
is
featherbedding
because
a
man
can't
use
the
absolute
maximum
incentive
to
produce
the
absolute
last
piece,
just
to
say
that
hourly
wages
as
featherbedding,
because
it's
perfectly
clear
under
hourly
wages
that
five
out
of
six
industrial
employees
in
this
country
are
now
employed
on
hourly
wages,
not
on
incentive,
under
hourly
wages
there
is
no
incentive
for
the
man
to
work
his
head
off,
to
work
himself
to
death
for
earnings,
now
is
that
featherbedding?
we
don't
think
so.
therefore,
to
say
that
a
reasonable
limit,
ceiling
on
what
incentive
pay
shall
be
earned
is
no
more
featherbedding
or
slowdown
or
make
work
an
hourly
rate
slowdown.
i'm
sorry
your
honor,
i
shouldn't
have
interrupted
your
question.
mr.
john
silard
and
those
units
would
be
less
than
a
fair
day's
production,
is
that
you
substance?
mr.
john
silard
well,
if
it
was
not
less
than
a
fair
day's
production,
i
don't
see
that
there
is
any
infringement
on
the
employer's
consensual
right
to
perform
--
mr.
john
silard
well,
both
agreed
to
the
ceiling
itself
whether
it's
fair
or
not,
and
because
the
ceiling
is
in
fact
a
fair
day's
output.
mr.
john
silard
no,
there
is
no
issue
in
this
case
that
it's
a
fair
day's
output.
it's
clear
that
it
is
a
fair
day's
output.
mr.
john
silard
which
is
not
a
fair
day's
work.
mr.
john
silard
oh,
we
would
concede,
as
in
homebuilders,
we
do
in
our
brief
that
you
probably
have
an
8(b)(3)
in
the
sense
that
as
a
union
rule,
assume
to
some
legitimate
interest
in
the
promulgating
it,
nevertheless,
if
so
infringes
on
the
employer's
rights
that
the
union
has
an
obligation
to
sit
down
and
bargain
that
rule
out
with
the
employer
and
if
it
refuses
to
do
so,
and
in
effect
changes
the
conditions
of
working
unilaterally
that
you
would
have
a
violation
of
at
8(b)(3)
and
8(b)(1).
mr.
john
silard
well,
first
of
all
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
silard
first
of
all,
the
company
if
it
had
not
contractually
agreed
to
the
system
could
discipline
a
man
who
wasn't
producing
enough,
they
could
discharge
--
mr.
john
silard
and
the
fact
that
even
if
there
hadn't
--
never
been
bargaining
between
them,
there
is
not
anything
in
this
record
to
suggest
that
this
earnings
ceiling
is
a
featherbedding
slowdown
of
not
less
than
fair
day's
work
rule.
in
other
words,
this
is
an
earning
ceiling
here
not
a
production
ceiling.
there
is
nothing
on
the
record
at
all
apart
from
acquiescence
that
shows
that
this
is
some
pieces
of
slowdown
rule,
which
would
come
under
the
homebuilders
situation.
it's
an
earning
ceiling.
mr.
john
silard
i
think
that
takes
me
home,
it
takes
me
home,
but
even
if
you
didn't
have
it,
this
record
show
nothing
of
the
kind
of
slowdown
or
less
than
a
fair
day's
work
and
since
all
the
union
tells
it's
members
don't
collect
your
pay,
doesn't
say
don't
do
your
work,
we
wouldn't
have
an
intrusion
on
the
employer's
rights
in
any
event,
but
we
do
as
your
honor
points
out
have
18
years
of
collective
bargaining,
between
the
party
16
years
and
acquiescence.
i
want
to
say
one
word
about
the
genesis.
mr.
john
silard
i
was
about
to
say
your
honor
that
the
purposes
rule
is
clear
in
its
history.
this
rule
was
adopted
in
1944
just
before
the
war
labor
board
put
incentive
rates
into
effect
in
most
machinery
manufacturing
and
the
membership
as
the
bylaw
shows
got
together
and
said
if
the
war
labor
board
puts
in
incentive
rates
here,
now
we
in
this
union
have
always
hated
incentive
rates.
we
think
they
are
a
danger,
you
get
the
speed
up,
you
get
all
the
men
laid
off,
because
everybody
is
producing
more
and
more
and
more
at
the
incentive
of
a
higher
paycheck
at
the
end
of
the
week.
if
that
happens
here
the
man
said,
we're
going
to
put
up
on
ourselves
in
this
union
a
restriction,
a
reasonable
restriction
that
10%
or
20%
above
this,
those
rates,
is
what
we're
going
to
stop
drawing
our
pay,
otherwise
we're
going
to
work
ourselves
out
of
jobs,
work
ourselves
into
a
situation
in
which
the
older
men
who've
been
here
20
and
30
years
in
this
company
are
just
going
to
be
outworked
by
an
eager
beaver
who
can
do
a
fantastic
performance
and
with
great
skill
at
the
capacity
of
man
18
or
20
years
old
and
the
paycheck
is
then
before
them
to
make
them
do
that.
i
watch
the
super
bowl
game
the
other
day
and
$7500
made
each
of
those
young
jet
players
play
very
well.
well
that
facts
that
these
man
working
--
mr.
john
silard
excuse
me?
mr.
john
silard
well,
the
incentive
was
$7500
for
the
winner
and
all
i'm
saying
is
that
the
incentive
of
the
extra
pay
for
the
one
who
worked
tougher
was
plenty
of
incentive
for
young
men
to
beat
the
older,
the
more
experienced
quarterback.
mr.
john
silard
well,
i
think
part
of
it
is
the
reason.
i
hate
to
say
that
these
are
professional
football
players
your
honor,
often
it
looks
like
college
ball
but
i
think
there's
something
because
of
money
too
and
i
want
to
say
--
mr.
john
silard
well,
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
[laughter].
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
your
honor
is
not
that
--
it
is
precisely
this,
these
man
are
working
day
after
day,
week
after
week,
year
after
year.
they
can't
afford
to
be
playing
the
super
bowl
every
hour
they
are
working
live.
it's
just
too
wearing
on
these
men,
particularly
it's
the
older
ones
who
can't
keep
up
the
skill
and
by
the
way
this
is
precision
work
taking
great
skill
10,000
of
each
tolerances.
so
to
ask
a
man
who
is
been
there
25
years
to
go
home
with
a
half
of
the
paycheck
or
quarter
of
the
paycheck
of
somebody
else
because
there's
going
to
be
no
limit
on
incentive,
is
asking
him
to
work
consistently
under
the
tolerance
which
of
the
strain
of
too
great
a
competitive
pressure
and
that's
what
this
rule
is
about
justice
black,
this
is
not
a
slowdown,
no
--
mr.
john
silard
i'm
not
say
your
honor,
they'll
earn
half
as
much
as
the
younger
men,
that's
--
mr.
john
silard
no,
i
do
defend
it,
i
say
it's
not
right.
to
have
a
man
put
in
a
speedup
situation
which
you
had
in
--
mr.
john
silard
well,
i
defend
legally
on
this
basis
your
honor.
we
think
the
national
labor
relation
act
section
8(b)(1)
permits
a
union
to
have
rules
not
plainly
ultra
vires,
where
there
is
legitimate
union
interest
underlying
them.
to
say
there's
no
legitimate
union
interest
in
this
situation
in
putting
an
upper
limit
on
piece
rates
is
really
to
say
there's
no
legitimate
union
interest
in
the
negotiation
of
hourly
wages
and
yet
five
out
six
workers
work
on
hourly
wages.
that
is
the
unions
have
found
incentive
schemes.
if
they're
not
retarded
or
checked
by
any
upper
limits,
to
be
corrosive
of
the
internal
relationships
within
the
union,
to
lead
to
speedups,
to
layoffs
and
to
demoralization.
now
that's
a
legitimate
union
interest.
the
board,
the
examiner
and
the
court
below
all
found
it
to
be
a
legitimate
union
interest,
which
goes
further
i
think
that
allis-chalmers
required
this
court
to
draw
and
looking
at
this
union
rule
from
the
point
of
view
of
its
ultra
vires
side
of
the
rule.
we
say
a
rule
which
is
not
plainly
ultra
vires
in
the
sense
that
it
infringes
on
some
personal
civil
liberty
or
right,
but
within
the
areas
a
union's
legitimate
judgments
about
the
interests
of
man.
it's
clearly
protected
under
section
8(b)(1)(a)
from
labor
board
intrusion,
unless
and
i
want
to
back
to
the
unless,
unless
the
rule
has
been
used
as
a
means
of
subverting
some
other
right
protected
by
the
act,
such
as
section
(8)(b)(2),
(8)(b)(3)
and
(8)(b)(4)
and
i
want
to
point
this
court
that
there's
no
proviso
to
section
(8)(b)(2)
or
(8)(b)(3)
or
(8)(b)(4)
such
a
proviso
to
(8)(b)(1).
and
that
marine
workers
in
our
opinion
is
essentially
demonstrative
only
of
the
fact
that
the
limits
of
the
exemption
congress
afforded
to
unions
to
apply
non
ultra
vires
rules
to
their
members
by
membership
discipline
are
reached.
when
you
come
to
an
intrusion
by
such
discipline
upon
some
other
person's
protected
right
under
the
act,
the
neutral
under
(8)(b)(4),
the
employer
under
(8)(b)(3),
others
under
(8)(b)(2).
i
see
my
time
is
about
to
expire
and
i
want
to
make
one
point
to
this
court
which
has
been
lost
track
of
and
that's
the
point
that
we
are
not
here
before
this
court
saying
either
there
is
no
--
we're
not
saying
this
court,
there's
no
relief
for
injustices
and
arbitrariness
in
this
entire
area.
as
i
said
to
the
court
in
allis-chalmers,
the
common
law
courts
have
traditionally
been
available.
this
court
in
gonzales
said
it's
the
common
law
courts
that
you
go,
if
union
rules
are
arbitrarily
applied
and
you
get
back
in
the
union
if
you're
wrongfully
thrown
out.
the
question
is
this
not
whether
they
shall
be
relieved
somewhere
because
the
case
has
been
pending
in
eight
years
in
wisconsin
and
then
we
just
lost
it
last
year,
it's
in
our
brief,
on
the
merits
of
collecting
this
fine.
so
there's
plenty
of
remedy
in
the
state
courts,
the
question
is
shall
the
labor
board
get
into
this
thicket,
into
what
professor
cox
called
a
dismal
swamp
of
(8)(b)(1)
litigation
of
this
kind.
we
say
that
the
most
important
reason
not
to
tamper
with
the
congressional
decision,
in
1947
and
1959
to
leave
this
outside
the
province
of
the
labor
board
is
that
the
labor
board
has
been
entrusted
with
the
function
of
being
the
principle
arbiter
between
management
and
union.
now,
if
that
principle
arbitration
function
is
to
that
function
of
being
the
mediator,
the
man
in-between
the
two
contending
sides,
of
in
addition
by
sort
of
rewriting
of
1947
history,
the
labor
board
now
becomes
also
the
policemen
of
intra-union
conduct,
then
its
credibility,
its
acceptance
to
play
on
the
union
side
of
this
nation's
forces
will
be
impaired.
there's
nobody
less
well
situated
to
become
the
policemen
of
intra-union
judgments
and
disputes
of
this
kind.
one
man
says
i
like
this
union
rule,
or
one
says
i
don't
like
it.
no
one
it
seems
to
us
politically
wisdom
was
reflected
by
congress
when
it
said
it
is
precisely
the
labor
board
which
is
the
mediator
between
the
two
contending
sides
which
shall
not
go
in
there
and
become
the
policemen
of
union
discipline
and
union
rules.
we
think
great
political
wisdom
is
reflected
in
that
judgment
and
that
seems
to
us
the
paramount
reason
why
this
court
should
leave
the
matters
and
disputes
of
this
kind
in
the
common
law
courts
and
precisely
why
the
labor
board
is
the
last
body
that
congress
would
have
wanted
in,
and
to
never
put
them
into
this
business
but
it
wanted
in
just
--
deciding
is
a
good
rule
or
bad
rule
or
reasonable
rule
or
an
unreasonable
rule,
socially
desirable
rule
or
not,
do
we
agree
with
the
majority
of
98%
of
the
men
at
this
plant
who
have
always
voted
for
this
rule
or
do
we
go
with
four
men
in
this
particular
case
who
don't
like
the
rule.
that's
precisely
what
was
not
for
the
labor
board
and
we
believe
that
it
best
be
left
where
this
court
said
in
gonzales
it
wasn't.
it
would
left
the
common
law
courts
where
man
who
was
improperly
disciplined
can
get
relief
and
if
the
rule
upon
which
he
has
been
punished
is
an
arbitrary
rule,
the
common
law
courts
will
not
enforce
it
as
in
gonzales,
they
will
put
it
back
in
the
union,
if
it's
expelled,
they
will
give
him
back
his
damages,
if
he
had
any
damages.
the
issue
is
keeping
some
clear
lines
of
jurisdiction.
the
present
lines
we
submit
are
right
and
we
comeback
there
for
to
the
following
rule
which
we
need
in
all
respects,
a
rule
not
ultra
vires,
a
union
rule
not
plainly
ultra
vires,
does
not
violate
section
8(b)(1)
when
it's
enforced
by
reasonable
discipline
on
the
member
unless
the
--
mr.
john
silard
this
court
said
not
because,
it's
not
restrain
or
coercion.
now
if
(inaudible)
didn't
reach
the
proviso,
we
would
say
you
get
the
same
result
under
a
fair
reading
of
the
proviso
which
in
terms
speaks
only
of
membership
expulsion,
but
we
speak
the
same
general
intention
this
court
found
in
8(b)(1)'s
language
that
this
whole
area
was
left
by
congress
outside
of
the
ambit
of
the
labor
board's
concern
and
jurisdiction.
we
don't
care
while
you
get
there
by
the
restrain
or
coerce
line
or
the
proviso
line.
it
seems
to
us
--
mr.
john
silard
i
would
say
in
the
case
that's
presently
before
the
court,
i've
always
felt
the
proviso
was
probably
such
a
clear
expression
of
congress'
statement
that
this
whole
area
is
left
outside
the
board
ambit
and
jurisdiction
that
i
would
rest
on
the
proviso
rather
than
on
a
reconstruction
or
restrain
or
coerce.
however
--
mr.
john
silard
our
brief
necessarily
swings
between
the
two
points
of
allis-chalmers
emphasis
which
is
both
under
restrain
or
coerce
--
mr.
john
silard
and
on
proviso.
mr.
john
silard
thank
you.
mr.
john
silard
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
justice
fortas
has
asked
an
interesting
question
whether
a
union
by
bylaw
could
say
to
the
worker,
the
member
violate
your
contract
and
if
it
did
so,
justice
white
suggests
the
union
maybe
violating
the
contract
and
justice
fortas
asked
whether
may
--
the
union
may
not
also
be
violating
section
8(b)(1)?
we
say
probably,
given
the
case
of
homebuilders
in
the
ninth
circuit
which
has
been
read
by
both
sides
here,
given
a
case
where
the
union
attracts
a
certain
requirement
under
the
contract
such
as
the
8
hour
day
in
an
ordinary
hourly
rate
of
plan.
and
then
the
next
day,
they
put
in
bylaw
when
the
contract
goes
into
effect
that
says
notwithstanding,
never
mind
the
contract,
no
member
of
this
union
shall
work
more
than
seven
hours.
we
are
tempted
to
say
that,
that
would
be
a
violation
of
8(b)(3)
by
means
of
fines
against
a
member.
in
other
words,
we
take
this
view
that
while
congress
protected
the
relationship
of
the
member
and
the
union
(inaudible)
from
intrusion
by
the
labor
board,
that
it
is
the
internal
disputes
of
the
kind
of
allis-charmers
in
this
case
involved.
if
by
membership
control
the
union
sought
to
violate
the
rights
of
others
that
the
statute
protects,
for
instance
the
rights
of
neutrals
under
8(b)(4)
by
requiring
a
member
to
go
on
a
secondary
boycott
picket
line
which
is
bricklayers'
case
at
page
31
of
our
brief,
we
think
that
goes
too
far.
that
the
exemption
of
section
8(b)(1)
of
union
discipline
as
under
the
board's
scrutiny
cannot
go
so
far
as
to
permit
the
union
discipline
to
becomes
a
means
for
violating
other
rights
that
the
statue
protects
--
mr.
john
silard
and
if
this
were
--
mr.
john
silard
right
your
honor
and
--
mr.
john
silard
right,
we
would
know,
i
wouldn't
say
right
your
honor
i
would
say
wrong
on
two
accounts.
if
this
where
the
case
of
a
union
by
bylaw
requiring
a
member
not
to
--
mr.
john
silard
--
live
up
to
his
contract,
we
say
that
two
distinctions
in
this
case
and
i
want
to
emphasize
they're
quite
two
--
quite
separate
reasons
why
this
bylaw
is
not
of
the
order
of
the
homebuilders'
case
where
the
union
is
asking
its
member
to
violate
the
contract,
either
rights
of
the
employer
under
the
contract,
of
the
employee
under
the
contract.
the
first
reason
is
that
they
may
not
doing
a
fair
day's
work
even
within
the
ceiling
and
therefore
the
employer
has
never
said,
and
does
not
now
say
there
is
any
idleness
in
this
plant
by
virtue
of
these
ceilings.
the
second
reason
is
that
even
if
there
were
an
issue
as
to
a
fair
day's
work,
this
employer
has
contracted
for
16
years
in
consecutive
agreements
with
the
union
as
to
the
level
of
the
ceiling.
if
the
ceiling
is
too
low
to
permit
man
to
do
a
fair
day's
work,
the
employer
is
a
party
to
the
ceiling,
because
he
has
agreed
over
and
over
again
as
to
what
the
ceiling
will
be.
mr.
john
silard
let
us
say
it
this
way.
the
union
--
mr.
john
silard
i
will
say
it
infringes
upon
the
contract
to
that
employee,
but
may
i
say
this
your
honor,
allis-chalmers
did
too.
nothing
could
more
directly
infringe
upon
the
right
of
the
unionists
in
allis-chalmers
under
the
contract,
than
the
rule,
let's
say
you
shall
not
work
at
all.
so
that
to
say
that
a
union
bylaw
touches
upon
an
area
of
employment
rights,
doesn't
have
--
mr.
john
silard
no
--
mr.
john
silard
no
your
honor,
i'd
say
that
if
they
were
contracts,
breach
of
contract
suit
brought
by
the
employer
here
to
test
the
question
--
mr.
john
silard
well,
let
me
forget
the
contracts.
i
would
say
that
under
this
contract
the
employer
as
a
matter
of
successive
contracts,
in
1953,
1956,
1965
has
agreed
that
this
system
shall
operate
as
to
--
mr.
john
silard
i'm
not
getting
it
your
honor.
mr.
john
silard
i
don't
think
there
is
a
vested
right
by
a
union
member
in
this
plant
to
work
over
the
union
ceiling,
because
we
think
the
employer
has
agreed
that
no
union
member
shall
--
mr.
john
silard
oh
he
may
collect
it
as
a
matter
of
contract
right,
of
course.
mr.
john
silard
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
may
risk
breaking
the
union
bylaw
as
these
gentlemen
have
done,
but
as
a
matter
of
contractual
right,
he
has
a
right
to
collect
all
that
he
earned
by
production
and
of
course
--
mr.
john
silard
that's
right.
may
i
say
then
to
this
court
that
the
ultimate
question
seems
to
us
to
be
what
is
the
guiding
principal
of
8(b)(1)
after
allis-chalmers
and
marine
workers.
we
say
there
are
two
tests
to
be
met
in
a
case
of
this
kind,
because
we
say
that
section
8(b)(1)
now
does
not
restrict
the
union
from
enforcing
from
discipline
a
membership
rule,
not
plainly
ultra
vires,
unless
the
rule
invades
employer
or
public
rights
elsewhere
protected
in
the
statue.
before
i
get
into
the
law,
may
i
draw
this
court's
attention
to
footnote
5
on
page
9
of
our
brief,
because
this
fair
day's
work
issue
was
bargained
out
between
the
two
sides
very
recently.
in
the
middle
of
footnote
5,
on
page
9,
we
have
the
minutes
of
the
negotiations
in
1965
when
after
contractual
negotiations
the
ceilings
were
again
raised,
at
the
employer's
insistence.
interestingly,
in
these
minutes
the
following
is
reflected.
the
union
said
the
ceiling
is
good
for
the
union
and
the
company,
if
they
remove
it,
they'd
have
confusion.
the
union
said
the
ceilings
are
$0.40
to
$0.50
per
hour
above
the
timing
rate,
that's
the
average
rate,
which
is
considered
a
fair
day's
work
if
maintained.
todd,
that's
the
company
president,
figures
that
his
claims
shows
that
the
spread
between
the
timing
rate
and
the
ceilings
has
gradually
diminished.
in
other
words,
here
are
the
parties
bargaining
precisely
on
this
question.
is
this
ceiling
set
at
a
level
where
a
fair
day's
work
is
no
longer
being
maintained?
the
company
saying,
yes,
this
is
what
has
happened,
the
union
is
saying
it
hasn't
and
they
resolved
it
by
increasing
the
ceilings
$0.03
per
hour,
so
that
the
very
issue
as
to
a
fair
day's
work
as
against
slowdown
has
been
bargained
by
these
parties
and
the
result
has
been
compromised.
we
say
therefore,
the
very
hard
case
that
justice
fortas
puts
of
a
union
rule
that
requires
a
man
to
violate
a
contract
is
simply
not
before
this
court,
in
a
double
sense
that
this
particular
arrangement
and
existence
since
1944
has
won
acquiescence,
acceptance
and
agreement
from
the
employer
as
it
applies
to
union
members,
and
that
in
any
event
even
if
it
had
not
won
that
acquiescence,
the
scheme
as
it
operates
is
not
a
production
limiting
slowdown
scheme,
men
are
doing
a
fair
day's
work
under
it.
and
to
say
that
this
is
--
may
i
just
conclude
your
honor,
it's
to
say
this
is
featherbedding
because
a
man
can't
use
the
absolute
maximum
incentive
to
produce
the
absolute
last
piece,
just
to
say
that
hourly
wages
as
featherbedding,
because
it's
perfectly
clear
under
hourly
wages
that
five
out
of
six
industrial
employees
in
this
country
are
now
employed
on
hourly
wages,
not
on
incentive,
under
hourly
wages
there
is
no
incentive
for
the
man
to
work
his
head
off,
to
work
himself
to
death
for
earnings,
now
is
that
featherbedding?
we
don't
think
so.
therefore,
to
say
that
a
reasonable
limit,
ceiling
on
what
incentive
pay
shall
be
earned
is
no
more
featherbedding
or
slowdown
or
make
work
an
hourly
rate
slowdown.
i'm
sorry
your
honor,
i
shouldn't
have
interrupted
your
question.
mr.
john
silard
and
those
units
would
be
less
than
a
fair
day's
production,
is
that
you
substance?
mr.
john
silard
well,
if
it
was
not
less
than
a
fair
day's
production,
i
don't
see
that
there
is
any
infringement
on
the
employer's
consensual
right
to
perform
--
mr.
john
silard
well,
both
agreed
to
the
ceiling
itself
whether
it's
fair
or
not,
and
because
the
ceiling
is
in
fact
a
fair
day's
output.
mr.
john
silard
no,
there
is
no
issue
in
this
case
that
it's
a
fair
day's
output.
it's
clear
that
it
is
a
fair
day's
output.
mr.
john
silard
which
is
not
a
fair
day's
work.
mr.
john
silard
oh,
we
would
concede,
as
in
homebuilders,
we
do
in
our
brief
that
you
probably
have
an
8(b)(3)
in
the
sense
that
as
a
union
rule,
assume
to
some
legitimate
interest
in
the
promulgating
it,
nevertheless,
if
so
infringes
on
the
employer's
rights
that
the
union
has
an
obligation
to
sit
down
and
bargain
that
rule
out
with
the
employer
and
if
it
refuses
to
do
so,
and
in
effect
changes
the
conditions
of
working
unilaterally
that
you
would
have
a
violation
of
at
8(b)(3)
and
8(b)(1).
mr.
john
silard
well,
first
of
all
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
silard
first
of
all,
the
company
if
it
had
not
contractually
agreed
to
the
system
could
discipline
a
man
who
wasn't
producing
enough,
they
could
discharge
--
mr.
john
silard
and
the
fact
that
even
if
there
hadn't
--
never
been
bargaining
between
them,
there
is
not
anything
in
this
record
to
suggest
that
this
earnings
ceiling
is
a
featherbedding
slowdown
of
not
less
than
fair
day's
work
rule.
in
other
words,
this
is
an
earning
ceiling
here
not
a
production
ceiling.
there
is
nothing
on
the
record
at
all
apart
from
acquiescence
that
shows
that
this
is
some
pieces
of
slowdown
rule,
which
would
come
under
the
homebuilders
situation.
it's
an
earning
ceiling.
mr.
john
silard
i
think
that
takes
me
home,
it
takes
me
home,
but
even
if
you
didn't
have
it,
this
record
show
nothing
of
the
kind
of
slowdown
or
less
than
a
fair
day's
work
and
since
all
the
union
tells
it's
members
don't
collect
your
pay,
doesn't
say
don't
do
your
work,
we
wouldn't
have
an
intrusion
on
the
employer's
rights
in
any
event,
but
we
do
as
your
honor
points
out
have
18
years
of
collective
bargaining,
between
the
party
16
years
and
acquiescence.
i
want
to
say
one
word
about
the
genesis.
mr.
john
silard
i
was
about
to
say
your
honor
that
the
purposes
rule
is
clear
in
its
history.
this
rule
was
adopted
in
1944
just
before
the
war
labor
board
put
incentive
rates
into
effect
in
most
machinery
manufacturing
and
the
membership
as
the
bylaw
shows
got
together
and
said
if
the
war
labor
board
puts
in
incentive
rates
here,
now
we
in
this
union
have
always
hated
incentive
rates.
we
think
they
are
a
danger,
you
get
the
speed
up,
you
get
all
the
men
laid
off,
because
everybody
is
producing
more
and
more
and
more
at
the
incentive
of
a
higher
paycheck
at
the
end
of
the
week.
if
that
happens
here
the
man
said,
we're
going
to
put
up
on
ourselves
in
this
union
a
restriction,
a
reasonable
restriction
that
10%
or
20%
above
this,
those
rates,
is
what
we're
going
to
stop
drawing
our
pay,
otherwise
we're
going
to
work
ourselves
out
of
jobs,
work
ourselves
into
a
situation
in
which
the
older
men
who've
been
here
20
and
30
years
in
this
company
are
just
going
to
be
outworked
by
an
eager
beaver
who
can
do
a
fantastic
performance
and
with
great
skill
at
the
capacity
of
man
18
or
20
years
old
and
the
paycheck
is
then
before
them
to
make
them
do
that.
i
watch
the
super
bowl
game
the
other
day
and
$7500
made
each
of
those
young
jet
players
play
very
well.
well
that
facts
that
these
man
working
--
mr.
john
silard
excuse
me?
mr.
john
silard
well,
the
incentive
was
$7500
for
the
winner
and
all
i'm
saying
is
that
the
incentive
of
the
extra
pay
for
the
one
who
worked
tougher
was
plenty
of
incentive
for
young
men
to
beat
the
older,
the
more
experienced
quarterback.
mr.
john
silard
well,
i
think
part
of
it
is
the
reason.
i
hate
to
say
that
these
are
professional
football
players
your
honor,
often
it
looks
like
college
ball
but
i
think
there's
something
because
of
money
too
and
i
want
to
say
--
mr.
john
silard
well,
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
[laughter].
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
your
honor
is
not
that
--
it
is
precisely
this,
these
man
are
working
day
after
day,
week
after
week,
year
after
year.
they
can't
afford
to
be
playing
the
super
bowl
every
hour
they
are
working
live.
it's
just
too
wearing
on
these
men,
particularly
it's
the
older
ones
who
can't
keep
up
the
skill
and
by
the
way
this
is
precision
work
taking
great
skill
10,000
of
each
tolerances.
so
to
ask
a
man
who
is
been
there
25
years
to
go
home
with
a
half
of
the
paycheck
or
quarter
of
the
paycheck
of
somebody
else
because
there's
going
to
be
no
limit
on
incentive,
is
asking
him
to
work
consistently
under
the
tolerance
which
of
the
strain
of
too
great
a
competitive
pressure
and
that's
what
this
rule
is
about
justice
black,
this
is
not
a
slowdown,
no
--
mr.
john
silard
i'm
not
say
your
honor,
they'll
earn
half
as
much
as
the
younger
men,
that's
--
mr.
john
silard
no,
i
do
defend
it,
i
say
it's
not
right.
to
have
a
man
put
in
a
speedup
situation
which
you
had
in
--
mr.
john
silard
well,
i
defend
legally
on
this
basis
your
honor.
we
think
the
national
labor
relation
act
section
8(b)(1)
permits
a
union
to
have
rules
not
plainly
ultra
vires,
where
there
is
legitimate
union
interest
underlying
them.
to
say
there's
no
legitimate
union
interest
in
this
situation
in
putting
an
upper
limit
on
piece
rates
is
really
to
say
there's
no
legitimate
union
interest
in
the
negotiation
of
hourly
wages
and
yet
five
out
six
workers
work
on
hourly
wages.
that
is
the
unions
have
found
incentive
schemes.
if
they're
not
retarded
or
checked
by
any
upper
limits,
to
be
corrosive
of
the
internal
relationships
within
the
union,
to
lead
to
speedups,
to
layoffs
and
to
demoralization.
now
that's
a
legitimate
union
interest.
the
board,
the
examiner
and
the
court
below
all
found
it
to
be
a
legitimate
union
interest,
which
goes
further
i
think
that
allis-chalmers
required
this
court
to
draw
and
looking
at
this
union
rule
from
the
point
of
view
of
its
ultra
vires
side
of
the
rule.
we
say
a
rule
which
is
not
plainly
ultra
vires
in
the
sense
that
it
infringes
on
some
personal
civil
liberty
or
right,
but
within
the
areas
a
union's
legitimate
judgments
about
the
interests
of
man.
it's
clearly
protected
under
section
8(b)(1)(a)
from
labor
board
intrusion,
unless
and
i
want
to
back
to
the
unless,
unless
the
rule
has
been
used
as
a
means
of
subverting
some
other
right
protected
by
the
act,
such
as
section
(8)(b)(2),
(8)(b)(3)
and
(8)(b)(4)
and
i
want
to
point
this
court
that
there's
no
proviso
to
section
(8)(b)(2)
or
(8)(b)(3)
or
(8)(b)(4)
such
a
proviso
to
(8)(b)(1).
and
that
marine
workers
in
our
opinion
is
essentially
demonstrative
only
of
the
fact
that
the
limits
of
the
exemption
congress
afforded
to
unions
to
apply
non
ultra
vires
rules
to
their
members
by
membership
discipline
are
reached.
when
you
come
to
an
intrusion
by
such
discipline
upon
some
other
person's
protected
right
under
the
act,
the
neutral
under
(8)(b)(4),
the
employer
under
(8)(b)(3),
others
under
(8)(b)(2).
i
see
my
time
is
about
to
expire
and
i
want
to
make
one
point
to
this
court
which
has
been
lost
track
of
and
that's
the
point
that
we
are
not
here
before
this
court
saying
either
there
is
no
--
we're
not
saying
this
court,
there's
no
relief
for
injustices
and
arbitrariness
in
this
entire
area.
as
i
said
to
the
court
in
allis-chalmers,
the
common
law
courts
have
traditionally
been
available.
this
court
in
gonzales
said
it's
the
common
law
courts
that
you
go,
if
union
rules
are
arbitrarily
applied
and
you
get
back
in
the
union
if
you're
wrongfully
thrown
out.
the
question
is
this
not
whether
they
shall
be
relieved
somewhere
because
the
case
has
been
pending
in
eight
years
in
wisconsin
and
then
we
just
lost
it
last
year,
it's
in
our
brief,
on
the
merits
of
collecting
this
fine.
so
there's
plenty
of
remedy
in
the
state
courts,
the
question
is
shall
the
labor
board
get
into
this
thicket,
into
what
professor
cox
called
a
dismal
swamp
of
(8)(b)(1)
litigation
of
this
kind.
we
say
that
the
most
important
reason
not
to
tamper
with
the
congressional
decision,
in
1947
and
1959
to
leave
this
outside
the
province
of
the
labor
board
is
that
the
labor
board
has
been
entrusted
with
the
function
of
being
the
principle
arbiter
between
management
and
union.
now,
if
that
principle
arbitration
function
is
to
that
function
of
being
the
mediator,
the
man
in-between
the
two
contending
sides,
of
in
addition
by
sort
of
rewriting
of
1947
history,
the
labor
board
now
becomes
also
the
policemen
of
intra-union
conduct,
then
its
credibility,
its
acceptance
to
play
on
the
union
side
of
this
nation's
forces
will
be
impaired.
there's
nobody
less
well
situated
to
become
the
policemen
of
intra-union
judgments
and
disputes
of
this
kind.
one
man
says
i
like
this
union
rule,
or
one
says
i
don't
like
it.
no
one
it
seems
to
us
politically
wisdom
was
reflected
by
congress
when
it
said
it
is
precisely
the
labor
board
which
is
the
mediator
between
the
two
contending
sides
which
shall
not
go
in
there
and
become
the
policemen
of
union
discipline
and
union
rules.
we
think
great
political
wisdom
is
reflected
in
that
judgment
and
that
seems
to
us
the
paramount
reason
why
this
court
should
leave
the
matters
and
disputes
of
this
kind
in
the
common
law
courts
and
precisely
why
the
labor
board
is
the
last
body
that
congress
would
have
wanted
in,
and
to
never
put
them
into
this
business
but
it
wanted
in
just
--
deciding
is
a
good
rule
or
bad
rule
or
reasonable
rule
or
an
unreasonable
rule,
socially
desirable
rule
or
not,
do
we
agree
with
the
majority
of
98%
of
the
men
at
this
plant
who
have
always
voted
for
this
rule
or
do
we
go
with
four
men
in
this
particular
case
who
don't
like
the
rule.
that's
precisely
what
was
not
for
the
labor
board
and
we
believe
that
it
best
be
left
where
this
court
said
in
gonzales
it
wasn't.
it
would
left
the
common
law
courts
where
man
who
was
improperly
disciplined
can
get
relief
and
if
the
rule
upon
which
he
has
been
punished
is
an
arbitrary
rule,
the
common
law
courts
will
not
enforce
it
as
in
gonzales,
they
will
put
it
back
in
the
union,
if
it's
expelled,
they
will
give
him
back
his
damages,
if
he
had
any
damages.
the
issue
is
keeping
some
clear
lines
of
jurisdiction.
the
present
lines
we
submit
are
right
and
we
comeback
there
for
to
the
following
rule
which
we
need
in
all
respects,
a
rule
not
ultra
vires,
a
union
rule
not
plainly
ultra
vires,
does
not
violate
section
8(b)(1)
when
it's
enforced
by
reasonable
discipline
on
the
member
unless
the
--
mr.
john
silard
this
court
said
not
because,
it's
not
restrain
or
coercion.
now
if
(inaudible)
didn't
reach
the
proviso,
we
would
say
you
get
the
same
result
under
a
fair
reading
of
the
proviso
which
in
terms
speaks
only
of
membership
expulsion,
but
we
speak
the
same
general
intention
this
court
found
in
8(b)(1)'s
language
that
this
whole
area
was
left
by
congress
outside
of
the
ambit
of
the
labor
board's
concern
and
jurisdiction.
we
don't
care
while
you
get
there
by
the
restrain
or
coerce
line
or
the
proviso
line.
it
seems
to
us
--
mr.
john
silard
i
would
say
in
the
case
that's
presently
before
the
court,
i've
always
felt
the
proviso
was
probably
such
a
clear
expression
of
congress'
statement
that
this
whole
area
is
left
outside
the
board
ambit
and
jurisdiction
that
i
would
rest
on
the
proviso
rather
than
on
a
reconstruction
or
restrain
or
coerce.
however
--
mr.
john
silard
our
brief
necessarily
swings
between
the
two
points
of
allis-chalmers
emphasis
which
is
both
under
restrain
or
coerce
--
mr.
john
silard
and
on
proviso.
mr.
john
silard
thank
you.
