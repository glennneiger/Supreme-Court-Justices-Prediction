j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
being
a
candidate,
you
express
those
constitutional
question
that
in
addition
to
substantial
population
equality.
constitutionally,
does
it
also
require
compactness?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
the
way
you
handle
--
express
that
gerrymandering
can't
be
done
whether
it's
for
consummations,
religious,
political,
or
otherwise
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
you
didn't
produce
the
element
of
compactness
as
in
our
constitution.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
i
forgot
some
while
now,
but
did
the
old
1912
statute,
the
federal
statute,
as
i
recall,
it
used
to
have
the
criteria
of
compactness,
contiguity
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
also
population
criterion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
that,
of
course,
was
repealed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
then
the
old
broom
case,
broom
--
in
wood
versus
broom,
wasn't
there
some
consideration
of
compactness
as
a
constitutional
criterion
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
it
raised
or
suggested?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
in
any
event,
you
would
ask
us
to
add
to
substantial
population
quality
a
constitutional
requirement
of
compactness.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
about
contiguity?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
what
you
would
really
have
us
do
then,
ultimately,
i
take
it,
is
to
convert
that
stat
--
those
statutory
criterion
getting
the
population
equality
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
we've
now
defined
it,
into
constitutional
criterion.
