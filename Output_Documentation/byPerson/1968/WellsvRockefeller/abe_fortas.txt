justice

what's
happened
to
rochester?
justice
abe
fortas
where
is
rochester?
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
your
argument
that
it
is
constitutionally
relevant
to
consider
the
economic
or
consolation
incurs
or
whatever
you
referred
to
in
terms
of
the
justification
of
population
disparities
among
districts?
let's
suppose
you
have
a
case
where
there's
a
very
large
population
disparity
between
district
a
and
district
b,
and
let
us
suppose
that
that
population
disparity
is
a
result
of
the
legislature's
judgment
that
it's
appropriate
to
consider
the
border
counties
in
district
a
rather
than
district
b
because
those
border
counties
have
interests
that
are
harmonious
with
the
rest
of
district
a
but
not
harmonious
with
district
b.
are
you
arguing
to
us
that
that
is
a
relevant
constitutional
fact?
justice
abe
fortas
is
what?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know,
but
are
you
saying
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
if
the
disparity
is
gross?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
are
the
factors
that
are
relevant
in
--
constitutionally
relevant,
assuming
any
gross
disparity,
any
factors?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
suppose
it's
not
quite
so
gross.
suppose
it's
just
a
little
gross.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i
understand.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
it
to
be
the
constitutional
standard.
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
you
just
said
that
that's
constitutionally
irrelevant
where
you
have
a
gross
population
disparity.
now,
let
me
change
the
wording.
let
us
suppose
that,
numerically,
there
is
a
disparity,
just
on
the
basis
of
numbers,
which
is
constitutionally
objectionable.
would
--
is
it
cons
--
is
it
permissible?
is
it
mandatory
or
is
it
permissible
for
this
court
to
take
into
account
the
conservation
interest
in
the
terms
that
you
just
stated?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
how
does
that
affect
--
does
the
--
does
that
affect
the
literal
constitutional
standard?
the
constitutional
objective,
if
i
may
speak
very
roughly
and
broadly,
is
to
see
that
one
man's
vote
is
equal
to
--
has
equal
effect
with
the
vote
of
another
man.
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
in
lay
parlance.
now,
what
does
the
conservation
factor
in
the
example
you've
put
to
us
have
to
do
with
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
in
the
midland
county
case,
i
wrote
an
opinion
in
connection
with
the
local
government
problem
and
made
arguments
of
that
sort.
i
regret
to
remind
you
that
that
was
a
dissenting
opinion.
i
don't
believe
it
should've
been,
but
that's
the
way
it
turned
out.
that's
--
justice
abe
fortas
but,
you
are
arguing
then
that
these
qualitative
factors
are
constitutionally
relevant.
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
see
a
difference
between
that
kind
of
an
interest,
say,
con
--
representation
of
conservationist
interest
on
the
one
hand
and
gerrymandering
on
the
other
in
terms
of
constitutional
relevance?
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
hope
you'll
say
something
about
6
and
8
--
districts
6
and
8.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
being
there,
may
i
ask
you
along
the
same
lines
that
my
brother
brennan
has
been
asking
questions.
do
you
really
mean
that
or
do
you
mean
that
where
there
is
gerrymandering,
the
likelihood
is
very
great
that
the
result
of
it
will
be
to
dilute
or,
arbitrarily,
to
manipulate
the
effect
of
the
individual's
vote
so
that,
in
short,
are
you
talking
about
two
constitutional
principles
here
or
one?
justice
abe
fortas
one
constitutional
principle
has
been
popularly
called
the
one
man-one
vote
principle.
now,
is
gerrymandering
under
that
heading
or
is
it
something
different
in
constitutional
terms?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
i
live
in
the
northeast
section
of
a
state
and
the
legislature
gerrymanders
a
state
take
an
extreme
and,
therefore,
absurd
example
to
illustrate
the
point.
the
legislature
gerrymanders
a
state
so
as
to
put
my
area
in
within
the
extreme
southwest
portion
of
the
state
so
that
they'll
put
together
a
democratic
district.
then,
it
seems
to
me,
that
what's
happened
is
that
my
vote,
as
a
resident
of
one
of
these
extreme
areas,
is
being
manipulated.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
that
does
bear
upon
the
principle
of
equal
effect
to
my
vote.
justice
abe
fortas
and
it's
from
that
principle,
i
take
it,
that
you
would
derive
the
constitutional
basis
for
your
insistence
upon
an
absence
of
gerrymandering.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
i
understood
him.
we
don't
have
to
reach
this
gerrymandering
question
because
we
really
view
that
this
statute

population

are
