mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
discussing
new
york's
1968
congressional
districting
act,
i
believe
it
would
be
advisable
if
we
briefly
consider
the
background
of
this
litigation.
as
a
result
of
the
1960
census,
which
reduced
new
york's
congressional
delegation
from
43
to
41
seats,
it
was
necessary
to
draw
new
lines
in
1961.
now,
although
at
that
time
this
court
had
not
yet
come
down
with
the
decisions
in
reynolds
versus
sims,
baker
versus
carr,
or
wesberry
versus
sanders,
the
new
york
legislature,
in
its
report
of
the
joint
legislative
committee
on
reapportionment,
determined
that
the
most
important
criterion
to
follow
is
substantial
equality
of
population.
at
that
time,
the
standard
that
was
being
recommended
by
the
american
academy
of
political
science
by
former
president
truman
and
by
various
congressional
leaders
such
as
congressman
celler
was
that
no
district
should
exceed
the
state
mean
by
more
than
15%,
and
that
is
what
the
new
york
legislature
did
in
1961.
the
precedent
suit
was
instituted
in
1966
and,
when
the
three-judge
court
reached
its
conclusion
in
1967,
they
concluded
that
whatever
standard
the
legislature
may
have
followed
in
1961
had
become
outmoded
as
a
result
of
the
recent
decisions
of
this
court.
they
also
particularly
criticized
the
congressional
districts
in
brooklyn
under
the
1961
act
where
disparities
of
up
to
29.5%
existed
among
contiguous
districts.
but,
when
it
came
to
determining
an
appropriate
remedy,
the
district
court,
in
its
opinion,
acknowledged
that
it
might
be
preferable
to
wait
until
the
1970
census
figures
were
available
rather
than
having
the
legislature
draw
new
lines
in
1968
based
on
figures
that
were
eight
years
old.
however,
the
court
felt
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
swann
versus
adams
precluded
such
an
extension.
accordingly,
to
resolve
this
dilemma,
the
court
below
suggested
a
compromise
which
i'd
like
to
just
quote
from
it
because
this
was
really
important
when
the
legislature
drew
the
lines.
the
court
said
“acting
upon
the
assumption,
that
accurate
congressional
representation
must
await
the
1970
census
and
upon
the
supreme
court's
understandable
objection
to
protract
a
delay,
a
compromise
may
be
in
order.”
the
1968
and
1970
congressional
districts
ought
to
be
held
in
districts
far
more
equalized
than
they
are
at
present.
there
are
rough
changes
which
can
be
superimposed
on
the
present
districts
to
pure
the
most
flagrant
inequalities.
when
the
legislature
drew
the
lines
in
1968,
they
followed
this
admonition
from
the
district
court.
whereas,
before,
six
of
the
congressional
districts
were
above
10%
from
the
state
mean
and
seven
districts
were
below
10%
from
the
state
mean.
there
is
no
district
in
the
1968
act,
which
his
more
than
10%.
the
largest
deviation
-6.6%
rests
upon
rational
state
policies,
which
i
will
come
to
in
a
minute.
as
for
appellant's
argument
that
the
legislature
didn't
have
time
to
consider
this
thing,
first,
let
me
point
out
that
the
joint
legislative
committee
on
reapportionment
issued
a
20-page
report
which
outlined
its
policies,
and
these
were
in
the
hands
of
the
legislature
several
weeks
before
the
act
was
actually
passed.
the
bill
was
introduced
on
february
20,
and
it
was
six
days
later
when
the
legislature
enacted
the
statute.
after
considering
the
policies
set
forth
in
the
report
of
the
joint
legislative
committee
on
reapportionment
and,
after
hearing
witnesses
for
the
state
and
after
giving
any
party
or
any
person,
i
might
add,
in
the
state
an
opportunity
to
criticize
these
districts
at
a
hearing
in
march
of
last
year,
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
legislature
had
indeed
cured
the
defects
under
the
prior
1961
statute.
in
brooklyn
where
the
greatest
disparities
occurred,
as
i
mentioned,
up
to
29.5%
under
the
1961
lines,
the
seven
districts
in
this
area
are
now
all
within
one-tenth
of
1%
of
each
other
and
they
are
all
less
than
2%
from
the
state
mean.
the
minor
population
disparities
that
exist
among
new
york's
districts
rest
upon
rational
state
policies
which
were
undertaken
by
the
legislature
to,
first,
of
course,
create
districts
that
are
substantially
equal
in
population
but,
at
the
same
time,
to
respect
the
integrity
of
county
lines
where
possible
and
to
afford
recognition
to
the
natural
geographic
and
economic
regions
within
the
state
of
new
york.
now,
in
new
york
state,
the
problems
and
the
aspirations
of
the
people
of
new
york
city
are
far
different
from
those
in
long
island
or
westchester
or,
similarly,
the
problems
of
people
in
the
mohawk
valley
and
what
they
expect
of
their
representatives
in
congress
are
far
different
from
the
people
in
the
adirondacks
or
in
the
niagara
frontier.
the
state
wanted
to
afford
some
recognition
to
these
regional
considerations.
for
example,
the
city
of
new
york,
in
light
of
its
independent
shrewder
and
its
special
political
and
economic
problems,
was
treated
as
a
separate
entity,
and
nobody,
including
appellant,
has
criticized
this.
dividing
the
population
of
new
york
city
into
the
population
of
the
state
entitled
the
city
to
19
congressional
seats,
and
19
is
what
it
received.
in
fact,
no
one
has
been
able
to
appoint
to
any
metropolitan
area
within
the
state
of
new
york
that
has
been
discriminated
against
in
the
drawing
of
the
1968
lines.
the
city
of
new
york
itself
divides
within
sub-regions.
manhattan
and
the
bronx
are
separated
from
brooklyn
and
the
other
boroughs
by
water,
and
there
are
some
new
yorkers
would
tell
you
there
is
more
than
just
a
body
of
water
which
separates
manhattan
from
brooklyn.
when
it
came
to
drawing
these
lines,
the
bronx
presented
a
problem
because
its
population
was
too
large
for
just
three
districts,
but
not
large
enough
for
four
full
districts.
therefore,
a
small
segment
of
the
bronx,
the
southwest
portion,
was
attached
to
a
district
in
manhattan
which
is
connected
to
by
four
bridges.
all
together,
the
eight
districts
given
to
manhattan
and
the
bronx
do
not
vary
from
each
other
by
more
than
one-quarter
of
1%.
queens
presented
a
problem
because
its
population
of
1,800,000
was
too
large
for
just
four
districts,
but
not
large
enough
for
five
full
districts.
to
overcome
this
problem,
the
rockaway
peninsular,
which
lies
to
the
south
of
queens
and
which
his
connected
by
toll
bridges
to
brooklyn,
was
joined
in
the
brooklyn
districts.
therefore,
the
other
four
districts
were
all
within
the
county
of
queens,
which
warrants
to
produce
districts
which
don't
vary
from
each
other
by
more
than
about
200
persons.
preserving
the
integrity
of
new
york
city
lines
left
nassau
and
suffern
counties
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
state,
and
this
was
treated
as
a
separate
region
in
the
drawing
of
five
congressional
districts
which
are
approximately
equal
to
each
other.
when
we
move
north
of
the
new
york
city
lines,
the
legislature
follow
the
county
lines
wherever
possible.
the
counties
of
westchester,
monroe,
and
gerry
which
were
too
large
for
just
one
district,
of
course,
had
to
be
divided,
but
every
other
county
of
the
state
has
not
been
divided
in
the
creation
of
the
congressional
districts.
now,
in
the
extreme
western
portion
of
the
state,
the
1961
districts
were
left
alone
in
the
drawing
of
the
1968
statute.
the
reason
for
this
is,
first,
nobody
had
criticized
these
lines
in
the
19
--
in
the
arguments
prior
to
the
issuance
of
the
prior
opinion
nor
had
the
district
court
pointed
out
these
lines
as
being
particularly
large
in
disparities,
but
another
reason
was
that
these
districts
rest
upon
rational
state
considerations
as
well.
for
instance,
the
largest
deviation
among
the
present
districts
is
the
38th
congressional
district,
and
that's
the
area
just
south
of
gerry,
south
of
buffalo.
this
is
composed
of
five
small
agrarian
counties
which
are
all
similar
both
as
to
their
nature
and
as
to
their
economy.
the
only
way
to
make
this
district
a
little
bit
closer
to
the
state
mean
would've
been
to
take
a
portion
of
gerry
county
and
join
this
into
the
38
districts.
however,
niagara
and
gerry
counties
form
an
area
which
is
known
in
the
state
as
the
niagara
frontier.
they
are
treated
alike
when
it
comes
to
receiving
federal
and
state
grants
in
various
state
projects.
and
they
have
practically
nothing
at
all
in
common
with
the
agrarian
counties
in
the
southwest
here.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
i
believe
jamestown
is
in
the
38th
district.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
yes,
your
honor.
that,
i
think,
might
be
about
the
largest
city
in
that
--
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
pardon?
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
rochester
is
in
monroe
county.
that's
the
--
yes,
the
37th
and
the
36th
districts.
in
that
particular
area,
as
long
as
you
bring
it
up,
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
that
area
was
divided
as
it
has
been
for
the
past
prior
two
congressional
districting
statutes,
right
along
the
genesee
river.
now,
it
is
interesting
that
nobody
from
upstate
or
the
western
portion
of
the
state
came
into
the
district
court
to
challenge
these
lines.
in
fact,
we
have
no
one
from
any
of
the
political
parties
here
before
this
court
to
challenge
these
lines.
we
have
just
one
private
citizen
from
queens
who
is
taking
up
a
supposed
argument
for
the
people
upstate
or
in
the
western
portions
of
the
state.
he
argues
that
he
could
come
up
with
a
plan
which
would
somewhat
reduce
the
disparities
in
new
york's
present
congressional
districts.
however,
he
does
it
by
ignoring
many
of
the
considerations
which
were
held
to
be
very
vital
by
new
york
legislature.
as
an
example,
he
would
move
lewis
county
from
the
present
31st
district
where
it
is
joined
with
the
other
adirondack
counties
and
move
it
into
the
other
32nd
district
which
would,
true,
bring
the
disparity
down
a
little
bit.
however,
in
that
event,
lewis
county,
which
strongly
believes
in
conservation
since
it
is
part
of
the
adirondack
preserve,
would
then
be
under
the
domination
of
the
metropolitan
area
of
utica.
appellant
claims
that
part
of
the
--
that
a
similar
district
was
drawn
in
the
state
assembly
or
state
senate,
but
those
districts
are
much
smaller
in
population.
they're
only
about
one-half
the
size
in
population
of
a
congressional
district,
so
it
was
no
possible
to
create
one
district
just
to
encompass
the
adirondacks.
as
for
the
examples
that
appellant
has
given
towards
the
division
of
cities,
there
were
a
few
cities
where
it
was
impossible
to
keep
them
intact.
i
should
say
only
really
two
cities,
i
believe,
in
the
whole
state.
one,
the
city
of
yonkers,
a
little
portion,
i
believe
one
ward,
was
taken
out
of
yonkers
in
the
creation
of
the
25th
and
the
26th
districts.
however,
the
only
way
appellant
gets
around
this
in
his
supposed
plan
is
to
take
hampton
county
and
move
it
northward
into
the
28th
district.
now,
this
is
an
example
of
how
a
private
citizen
doesn't
understand
the
aspirations
of
the
problems
that
are
fought
by
other
people
in
the
state.
hamp
--
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
that's
so
limited
in
extent,
mr.
justice
fortas.
what
i
am
arguing
is
that
the
most
important
criterion,
of
course,
is
equality
of
population,
but
--
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
equality
of
population,
but
i
believe
disparities
--
minor
disparities
should
be
permissible
when
the
state
feels
that
rational
state
policies
require
such
a
disparity.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
but,
i'm
not
saying
if
--
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
no,
your
honor.
if
the
disparity
was,
say,
50%
or
30%,
i
would
not
say
that
this
should
--
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
well,
if
the
disparity
is
gross
enough,
i
suppose
no
explanation
by
the
state
would
satisfy
this
court.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
well,
i
think
what
this
court
is
really
interested
in
is
fair
and
effective
representation.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
and
well,
i
--
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
yes.
well,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
legislature
might
feel,
for
instance,
that
nobody
in
congress
is
speaking
for
the
conservationist
interest
of
the
state.
there
are
41
congressmen
from
new
york.
they
might
feel
that
it
was
necessary
to
have
at
least
one
congressman
who
represented
the
adirondack
preserve.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
i
believe
it
is
permissible.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
well,
what
i
was
referring
back
to
the
language
i
used,
the
fair
and
effective
representation,
i
believe,
can
be
found
in
the
reynolds
versus
sims
opinion.
i
believe
this
was
the
overall
goal,
one
man-one
vote
was
held
to
be
the
guiding
principle
which
would
lead
towards
the
effectuation
of
this
goal.
but,
this
is
not
just
solely
a
question
of
numbers.
basically,
people
want
to
be
adequately
represented
in
congress,
and
the
question
then
becomes
who
is
being
injured?
if
the
result
of
creating
a
congressional
district
representing
conservationist
interest
is
such
that
the
district
is
6%
or
7%
from
the
state
mean,
is
anyone
else
in
the
state
really
being
injured
to
any
way
or
extent?
perhaps,
in
the
very
abstract
sense,
they
are,
but
if
one
vote
is
94th
or
100th
of
another
vote,
i
would
say
the
injury
really
only
lie
in
the
abstract.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
i
am.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
well,
let
me
get
to
the
issue
of
gerrymandering
because
i
think
that
presents
rather
complicated
facts.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
yes,
i
will.
first,
let
me
say
at
the
outset
that
this
court
has
never
held
that
partisan
gerrymandering
presents
a
cognizable
issue
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
would
say,
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
it
would
be
hard
to
imagine
a
weaker
test
case
than
the
present
one
to
bring
forth
this
issue.
there
is
a
great
deal
of
confusion,
first
of
all,
about
what
gerrymandering
means.
the
evil
of
the
original
gerrymandering
districts
of
massachusetts
was
not
that
they
took
the
shape
of
a
salamander
or
a
dragon.
the
evil
there
was
that
the
result
was
expected
to
produce
a
completely
disproportionate
share
of
seats
to
one
party,
when
i
say
disproportionate,
i
mean
that
because
of
--
that
the
lines
were
drawn
in
such
a
way
that
one
party
was
expecting
to
get
many
more
seats
than
their
general
voting
patterns
in
the
state
would
entitle
them
to.
i
think
we
often
lose
sight
of
this
and,
looking
at
district
lines
in
the
abstract,
compactness
certainly
is
esthetically
pleasing
but
it
is
not
the
sole
answer.
you
could
have
perfectly
compact
districts
and
you
could
still
have
partisan
abusers,
if
any,
upon
where
various
groups
lie
within
the
state.
now,
assuming
that
gerrymandering
presented
a
justiciable
issue,
i
believe
it
should
be
evident
that
appellant
has
failed
to
present
any
evidence
which
would
justify
this
court
overturning
the
districts
on
that
basis.
first
of
all,
any
districting
plan
there
is
always
going
to
be
certain
districts
which
are
going
to
favor
one
party
and
districts
which
would
favor
another
party.

mckay,
in
one
of
his
articles
entitled
“reapportionment
reappraised,”
has
himself
said
that
legislative
representation
lines
are
never
neutral.
if
you
look
at
any
one
district,
you
could
always
argue
that
if
the
lines
were
drawn
to
the
left
two
blocks
or
to
the
right
three
blocks,
party
a
or
party
b
might
have
won
the
election.
what
i
think
of
one
terms
of
gerrymandering
is
the
definition
which
is
found
in
the
encyclopedia
of
social
sciences,
which
i
have
set
forth
in
my
brief,
and
this
speaks
of
the
abuse
of
power
by
a
party
that
is
dominant
at
the
time
in
the
legislature
so
as
to
maximize
its
political
strength
throughout
the
state.
now,
no
one
has
shown
that
there
was
any
abuse
under
new
york's
present
lines.
in
terms
of
political
realities,
they
could
have
been
an
abuse
because
the
democratic
party
controlled
the
state
assembly
and
the
republican
party
controlled
the
state
senate.
the
only
two
examples
that
appellant
has
been
able
to
point
so
are
the
35th
district
and
the
6th
district.
now,
the
35th
district
is
located
in
the
lower
central
valley
of
new
york.
it's
this
district
right
here.
it
is
rather
an
elongated
district
and
i
admit
it
is
not
esthetically
pleasing
if
the
lines
are
viewed
in
the
abstract,
but
it
is
a
perfectly
logical
district.
it
consists
of
eight
agrarian
counties.
they
are
all
small
in
population.
the
boundaries
of
the
district,
exactly
follows
the
boundaries
of
these
counties
and,
as
for
the
argument
that
this
was
drawn
with
some
partisan
intent
and
view,
as
upon
counsel
has
conceded,
although
it
was
expected
to
produce
a
republican
congressman
in
each
of
the
four
elections
that
have
taken
place
since
this
district
was
created.
the
democratic
candidate
has
won
the
election.
turning
to
queens,
we
have
the
example
of
the
6th
congressional
district,
and
what
appellant
is
basically
arguing
is
that
if
the
6th
district
was
drawing
somewhat
differently,
a
republican
candidate
might
not
have
won
that
district.
again,
in
terms
of
realities,
i
doubt
there's
very
much
because,
in
the
last
election,
the
republican
congressman,
they
carry
the
district
by
a
margin
of
2-1.
in
fact,
it
is
misleading
when
you
come
to
new
york
city,
just
talking
in
terms
of
republican
as
against
democratic.
the
people
of
new
york
city
are
quite
sophisticated
in
who
they
vote
for.
that
particular
candidate
is
a
republican
but
he
happens
to
have
a
very
liberal
persuasion
and
he
happens
to
draw
a
large
number
of
votes
from
democrats
and
independents.
what
appellant
tries
to
seize
upon
is
the
fact
that,
at
the
hearing
below,
a
witness
representing
the
majority
leader
of
the
state
senate
said
that
he
saw
nothing
wrong
with
a
district,
the
6th
district,
electing
a
republican
congressman.
what
he
was
saying,
if
his
remarks
are
read
in
the
full
context,
was
that
the
republican
party
generally
captures
about
43%
of
the
vote
in
the
borough
of
queens.
therefore,
he
couldn't
see
anything
wrong
in
having
them
elect
one
candidate
in
the
four
districts
that
are
allotted
to
queens.
in
fact,
if
the
democrats
won
all
four
districts,
the
argument
could've
been
made
that
this
was
not
fair
and
effective
representation.
now,
finally,
i
would
like
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
the
fact
that,
regardless
of
the
outcome
of
this
appeal,
new
york
will
have
to
draw
a
new
congressional
districting
lines
after
the
1970
census
because,
according
to
all
projections
of
the
united
states
census
bureau,
the
state
of
the
new
york
really
lose
at
least
one
congressional
seat.
we
feel
the
present
act
is
constitutional.
we
would
just
report.
if
this
court,
however,
should
feel
that
there
is
any
defect
in
any
of
these
lines,
we
would
ask
that,
under
equitable
considerations,
the
drawing
of
new
lines
be
deferred
until
the
1970
census
figures
are
available.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
i
would
imagine
that
would
be
in
1971.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
no,
i
would
say
that
the
1972
election
will
be
held
under
new
lines.
certainly,
i
think
the
legislature
should
have
the
figures
by
the
end
of
1971,
even
if
we
have
to
pay
more
money
to
get
them.
i
might
say
that
--
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
this
would
carry
through
--
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
well
for
one
more
election.
if
there
are
no
further
questions?
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
no.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
right,
this
is
the
--
that
argument
does
not
--
well,
of
course,
disparities
might
be
one
example,
but
let
me
--
as
--
while
you're
bringing
that
up,
let
me
begin
to
turn
to
the
example
in
the
adirondacks
where
we
said
that
lewis
was
kept
in
the
31st
district,
not
in
the
32nd.
now,
this
entire
area
here
is
republican.
the
republican
candidates
for
congress
captured
both
the
31sth
and
the
38th
districts
by
very
large
margins.
so,
the
reason
that
the
--
that
lewis
county
was
kept
in
the
31st
certainly
was
not
for
partisan
reasons.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
the
31st.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
yes.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
basically,
yes.
in
fact,
lewis
county,
what
occured
--
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
well,
as
i
said,
the
idea
there
was
to
try
to
get
a
congressman
who
would
represent
the
dominant
position
in
this
area.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
what
we
were
looking
for
were
logical
districts,
i
--
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
not
if
it
created
--
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
no,
your
honor,
not
if
it
created
large
disparities
in
population.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
well,
one
basic
--
this
is
the
--
this
area
is
agrarian.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
and
they
have
been
together
for
many
years
in
one
particular
district.
this
is
what
the
people
wanted
of
their
representatives.
this
is
the
brochure
that
was
brought
to
the
new
york
legislature.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
i'm
not
saying
that
the
legislature
was
required
to
order
that
--
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
in
every
case.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
what
i'm
saying
here
is
--
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
where
there
are
not
disparities
in
population
of
any
appreciable
extent
and
where
this
is
in
an
area
of
the
state
where
it's
not
logically
where
the
people
want
this.
where
this
is
the
impression
that
they
bring
to
bear
on
the
legislature.
otherwise,
if
the
legislature
--
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
that
would
be
rather
difficult
if
we
key
to
the
principle
of
contiguity.
what
i'm
saying
is
that,
i
believe,
to
try
to
get
fair
and
effective
representation,
it
may
not
impermissible
in
states
like
new
york
to
give
recognition
to
some
of
these
interests.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
no,
your
honor.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
no,
this
is
--
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
this
is
just
a
view
point,
but
i
don't
feel
the
ar
--
the
gerrymandering
argument,
i
feel,
is
so
weak
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
that,
on
throwing
this
in
as
--
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
on
the
strong?
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
well,
certainly,
we
have
--
when
we
talk
about
partisans
gerrymandering,
one
for
the
little
party
as
opposed
to
another,
and
there
really
is
no
argument
that
could
be
made
in
the
new
lines
of
the
31st
district.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
well,
that
only
played
in
elements
in
this
regard,
your
honor,
that
since
they
thought
there
would
be
new
district
lines
after
the
1970
census,
they
thought
it
would
be
foolish
to
completely
wipe
all
the
old
districts
off
the
map
and
start
in
a
vacuum.
they
thought
it
would
be
desirable
to
make
as
few
changes
as
possible
rather
than
have
three
completely
different
changes
in
congressional
constituencies
within
about
a
six-year
period.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
they
should
be
adhered
to,
to
the
extent
possible,
to
protect
against
the
gerrymander.
now,
the
question
was
raised
by
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
discussing
new
york's
1968
congressional
districting
act,
i
believe
it
would
be
advisable
if
we
briefly
consider
the
background
of
this
litigation.
as
a
result
of
the
1960
census,
which
reduced
new
york's
congressional
delegation
from
43
to
41
seats,
it
was
necessary
to
draw
new
lines
in
1961.
now,
although
at
that
time
this
court
had
not
yet
come
down
with
the
decisions
in
reynolds
versus
sims,
baker
versus
carr,
or
wesberry
versus
sanders,
the
new
york
legislature,
in
its
report
of
the
joint
legislative
committee
on
reapportionment,
determined
that
the
most
important
criterion
to
follow
is
substantial
equality
of
population.
at
that
time,
the
standard
that
was
being
recommended
by
the
american
academy
of
political
science
by
former
president
truman
and
by
various
congressional
leaders
such
as
congressman
celler
was
that
no
district
should
exceed
the
state
mean
by
more
than
15%,
and
that
is
what
the
new
york
legislature
did
in
1961.
the
precedent
suit
was
instituted
in
1966
and,
when
the
three-judge
court
reached
its
conclusion
in
1967,
they
concluded
that
whatever
standard
the
legislature
may
have
followed
in
1961
had
become
outmoded
as
a
result
of
the
recent
decisions
of
this
court.
they
also
particularly
criticized
the
congressional
districts
in
brooklyn
under
the
1961
act
where
disparities
of
up
to
29.5%
existed
among
contiguous
districts.
but,
when
it
came
to
determining
an
appropriate
remedy,
the
district
court,
in
its
opinion,
acknowledged
that
it
might
be
preferable
to
wait
until
the
1970
census
figures
were
available
rather
than
having
the
legislature
draw
new
lines
in
1968
based
on
figures
that
were
eight
years
old.
however,
the
court
felt
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
swann
versus
adams
precluded
such
an
extension.
accordingly,
to
resolve
this
dilemma,
the
court
below
suggested
a
compromise
which
i'd
like
to
just
quote
from
it
because
this
was
really
important
when
the
legislature
drew
the
lines.
the
court
said
“acting
upon
the
assumption,
that
accurate
congressional
representation
must
await
the
1970
census
and
upon
the
supreme
court's
understandable
objection
to
protract
a
delay,
a
compromise
may
be
in
order.”
the
1968
and
1970
congressional
districts
ought
to
be
held
in
districts
far
more
equalized
than
they
are
at
present.
there
are
rough
changes
which
can
be
superimposed
on
the
present
districts
to
pure
the
most
flagrant
inequalities.
when
the
legislature
drew
the
lines
in
1968,
they
followed
this
admonition
from
the
district
court.
whereas,
before,
six
of
the
congressional
districts
were
above
10%
from
the
state
mean
and
seven
districts
were
below
10%
from
the
state
mean.
there
is
no
district
in
the
1968
act,
which
his
more
than
10%.
the
largest
deviation
-6.6%
rests
upon
rational
state
policies,
which
i
will
come
to
in
a
minute.
as
for
appellant's
argument
that
the
legislature
didn't
have
time
to
consider
this
thing,
first,
let
me
point
out
that
the
joint
legislative
committee
on
reapportionment
issued
a
20-page
report
which
outlined
its
policies,
and
these
were
in
the
hands
of
the
legislature
several
weeks
before
the
act
was
actually
passed.
the
bill
was
introduced
on
february
20,
and
it
was
six
days
later
when
the
legislature
enacted
the
statute.
after
considering
the
policies
set
forth
in
the
report
of
the
joint
legislative
committee
on
reapportionment
and,
after
hearing
witnesses
for
the
state
and
after
giving
any
party
or
any
person,
i
might
add,
in
the
state
an
opportunity
to
criticize
these
districts
at
a
hearing
in
march
of
last
year,
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
legislature
had
indeed
cured
the
defects
under
the
prior
1961
statute.
in
brooklyn
where
the
greatest
disparities
occurred,
as
i
mentioned,
up
to
29.5%
under
the
1961
lines,
the
seven
districts
in
this
area
are
now
all
within
one-tenth
of
1%
of
each
other
and
they
are
all
less
than
2%
from
the
state
mean.
the
minor
population
disparities
that
exist
among
new
york's
districts
rest
upon
rational
state
policies
which
were
undertaken
by
the
legislature
to,
first,
of
course,
create
districts
that
are
substantially
equal
in
population
but,
at
the
same
time,
to
respect
the
integrity
of
county
lines
where
possible
and
to
afford
recognition
to
the
natural
geographic
and
economic
regions
within
the
state
of
new
york.
now,
in
new
york
state,
the
problems
and
the
aspirations
of
the
people
of
new
york
city
are
far
different
from
those
in
long
island
or
westchester
or,
similarly,
the
problems
of
people
in
the
mohawk
valley
and
what
they
expect
of
their
representatives
in
congress
are
far
different
from
the
people
in
the
adirondacks
or
in
the
niagara
frontier.
the
state
wanted
to
afford
some
recognition
to
these
regional
considerations.
for
example,
the
city
of
new
york,
in
light
of
its
independent
shrewder
and
its
special
political
and
economic
problems,
was
treated
as
a
separate
entity,
and
nobody,
including
appellant,
has
criticized
this.
dividing
the
population
of
new
york
city
into
the
population
of
the
state
entitled
the
city
to
19
congressional
seats,
and
19
is
what
it
received.
in
fact,
no
one
has
been
able
to
appoint
to
any
metropolitan
area
within
the
state
of
new
york
that
has
been
discriminated
against
in
the
drawing
of
the
1968
lines.
the
city
of
new
york
itself
divides
within
sub-regions.
manhattan
and
the
bronx
are
separated
from
brooklyn
and
the
other
boroughs
by
water,
and
there
are
some
new
yorkers
would
tell
you
there
is
more
than
just
a
body
of
water
which
separates
manhattan
from
brooklyn.
when
it
came
to
drawing
these
lines,
the
bronx
presented
a
problem
because
its
population
was
too
large
for
just
three
districts,
but
not
large
enough
for
four
full
districts.
therefore,
a
small
segment
of
the
bronx,
the
southwest
portion,
was
attached
to
a
district
in
manhattan
which
is
connected
to
by
four
bridges.
all
together,
the
eight
districts
given
to
manhattan
and
the
bronx
do
not
vary
from
each
other
by
more
than
one-quarter
of
1%.
queens
presented
a
problem
because
its
population
of
1,800,000
was
too
large
for
just
four
districts,
but
not
large
enough
for
five
full
districts.
to
overcome
this
problem,
the
rockaway
peninsular,
which
lies
to
the
south
of
queens
and
which
his
connected
by
toll
bridges
to
brooklyn,
was
joined
in
the
brooklyn
districts.
therefore,
the
other
four
districts
were
all
within
the
county
of
queens,
which
warrants
to
produce
districts
which
don't
vary
from
each
other
by
more
than
about
200
persons.
preserving
the
integrity
of
new
york
city
lines
left
nassau
and
suffern
counties
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
state,
and
this
was
treated
as
a
separate
region
in
the
drawing
of
five
congressional
districts
which
are
approximately
equal
to
each
other.
when
we
move
north
of
the
new
york
city
lines,
the
legislature
follow
the
county
lines
wherever
possible.
the
counties
of
westchester,
monroe,
and
gerry
which
were
too
large
for
just
one
district,
of
course,
had
to
be
divided,
but
every
other
county
of
the
state
has
not
been
divided
in
the
creation
of
the
congressional
districts.
now,
in
the
extreme
western
portion
of
the
state,
the
1961
districts
were
left
alone
in
the
drawing
of
the
1968
statute.
the
reason
for
this
is,
first,
nobody
had
criticized
these
lines
in
the
19
--
in
the
arguments
prior
to
the
issuance
of
the
prior
opinion
nor
had
the
district
court
pointed
out
these
lines
as
being
particularly
large
in
disparities,
but
another
reason
was
that
these
districts
rest
upon
rational
state
considerations
as
well.
for
instance,
the
largest
deviation
among
the
present
districts
is
the
38th
congressional
district,
and
that's
the
area
just
south
of
gerry,
south
of
buffalo.
this
is
composed
of
five
small
agrarian
counties
which
are
all
similar
both
as
to
their
nature
and
as
to
their
economy.
the
only
way
to
make
this
district
a
little
bit
closer
to
the
state
mean
would've
been
to
take
a
portion
of
gerry
county
and
join
this
into
the
38
districts.
however,
niagara
and
gerry
counties
form
an
area
which
is
known
in
the
state
as
the
niagara
frontier.
they
are
treated
alike
when
it
comes
to
receiving
federal
and
state
grants
in
various
state
projects.
and
they
have
practically
nothing
at
all
in
common
with
the
agrarian
counties
in
the
southwest
here.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
i
believe
jamestown
is
in
the
38th
district.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
yes,
your
honor.
that,
i
think,
might
be
about
the
largest
city
in
that
--
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
pardon?
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
rochester
is
in
monroe
county.
that's
the
--
yes,
the
37th
and
the
36th
districts.
in
that
particular
area,
as
long
as
you
bring
it
up,
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
that
area
was
divided
as
it
has
been
for
the
past
prior
two
congressional
districting
statutes,
right
along
the
genesee
river.
now,
it
is
interesting
that
nobody
from
upstate
or
the
western
portion
of
the
state
came
into
the
district
court
to
challenge
these
lines.
in
fact,
we
have
no
one
from
any
of
the
political
parties
here
before
this
court
to
challenge
these
lines.
we
have
just
one
private
citizen
from
queens
who
is
taking
up
a
supposed
argument
for
the
people
upstate
or
in
the
western
portions
of
the
state.
he
argues
that
he
could
come
up
with
a
plan
which
would
somewhat
reduce
the
disparities
in
new
york's
present
congressional
districts.
however,
he
does
it
by
ignoring
many
of
the
considerations
which
were
held
to
be
very
vital
by
new
york
legislature.
as
an
example,
he
would
move
lewis
county
from
the
present
31st
district
where
it
is
joined
with
the
other
adirondack
counties
and
move
it
into
the
other
32nd
district
which
would,
true,
bring
the
disparity
down
a
little
bit.
however,
in
that
event,
lewis
county,
which
strongly
believes
in
conservation
since
it
is
part
of
the
adirondack
preserve,
would
then
be
under
the
domination
of
the
metropolitan
area
of
utica.
appellant
claims
that
part
of
the
--
that
a
similar
district
was
drawn
in
the
state
assembly
or
state
senate,
but
those
districts
are
much
smaller
in
population.
they're
only
about
one-half
the
size
in
population
of
a
congressional
district,
so
it
was
no
possible
to
create
one
district
just
to
encompass
the
adirondacks.
as
for
the
examples
that
appellant
has
given
towards
the
division
of
cities,
there
were
a
few
cities
where
it
was
impossible
to
keep
them
intact.
i
should
say
only
really
two
cities,
i
believe,
in
the
whole
state.
one,
the
city
of
yonkers,
a
little
portion,
i
believe
one
ward,
was
taken
out
of
yonkers
in
the
creation
of
the
25th
and
the
26th
districts.
however,
the
only
way
appellant
gets
around
this
in
his
supposed
plan
is
to
take
hampton
county
and
move
it
northward
into
the
28th
district.
now,
this
is
an
example
of
how
a
private
citizen
doesn't
understand
the
aspirations
of
the
problems
that
are
fought
by
other
people
in
the
state.
hamp
--
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
that's
so
limited
in
extent,
mr.
justice
fortas.
what
i
am
arguing
is
that
the
most
important
criterion,
of
course,
is
equality
of
population,
but
--
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
equality
of
population,
but
i
believe
disparities
--
minor
disparities
should
be
permissible
when
the
state
feels
that
rational
state
policies
require
such
a
disparity.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
but,
i'm
not
saying
if
--
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
no,
your
honor.
if
the
disparity
was,
say,
50%
or
30%,
i
would
not
say
that
this
should
--
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
well,
if
the
disparity
is
gross
enough,
i
suppose
no
explanation
by
the
state
would
satisfy
this
court.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
well,
i
think
what
this
court
is
really
interested
in
is
fair
and
effective
representation.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
and
well,
i
--
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
yes.
well,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
legislature
might
feel,
for
instance,
that
nobody
in
congress
is
speaking
for
the
conservationist
interest
of
the
state.
there
are
41
congressmen
from
new
york.
they
might
feel
that
it
was
necessary
to
have
at
least
one
congressman
who
represented
the
adirondack
preserve.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
i
believe
it
is
permissible.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
well,
what
i
was
referring
back
to
the
language
i
used,
the
fair
and
effective
representation,
i
believe,
can
be
found
in
the
reynolds
versus
sims
opinion.
i
believe
this
was
the
overall
goal,
one
man-one
vote
was
held
to
be
the
guiding
principle
which
would
lead
towards
the
effectuation
of
this
goal.
but,
this
is
not
just
solely
a
question
of
numbers.
basically,
people
want
to
be
adequately
represented
in
congress,
and
the
question
then
becomes
who
is
being
injured?
if
the
result
of
creating
a
congressional
district
representing
conservationist
interest
is
such
that
the
district
is
6%
or
7%
from
the
state
mean,
is
anyone
else
in
the
state
really
being
injured
to
any
way
or
extent?
perhaps,
in
the
very
abstract
sense,
they
are,
but
if
one
vote
is
94th
or
100th
of
another
vote,
i
would
say
the
injury
really
only
lie
in
the
abstract.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
i
am.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
well,
let
me
get
to
the
issue
of
gerrymandering
because
i
think
that
presents
rather
complicated
facts.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
yes,
i
will.
first,
let
me
say
at
the
outset
that
this
court
has
never
held
that
partisan
gerrymandering
presents
a
cognizable
issue
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
would
say,
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
it
would
be
hard
to
imagine
a
weaker
test
case
than
the
present
one
to
bring
forth
this
issue.
there
is
a
great
deal
of
confusion,
first
of
all,
about
what
gerrymandering
means.
the
evil
of
the
original
gerrymandering
districts
of
massachusetts
was
not
that
they
took
the
shape
of
a
salamander
or
a
dragon.
the
evil
there
was
that
the
result
was
expected
to
produce
a
completely
disproportionate
share
of
seats
to
one
party,
when
i
say
disproportionate,
i
mean
that
because
of
--
that
the
lines
were
drawn
in
such
a
way
that
one
party
was
expecting
to
get
many
more
seats
than
their
general
voting
patterns
in
the
state
would
entitle
them
to.
i
think
we
often
lose
sight
of
this
and,
looking
at
district
lines
in
the
abstract,
compactness
certainly
is
esthetically
pleasing
but
it
is
not
the
sole
answer.
you
could
have
perfectly
compact
districts
and
you
could
still
have
partisan
abusers,
if
any,
upon
where
various
groups
lie
within
the
state.
now,
assuming
that
gerrymandering
presented
a
justiciable
issue,
i
believe
it
should
be
evident
that
appellant
has
failed
to
present
any
evidence
which
would
justify
this
court
overturning
the
districts
on
that
basis.
first
of
all,
any
districting
plan
there
is
always
going
to
be
certain
districts
which
are
going
to
favor
one
party
and
districts
which
would
favor
another
party.
professor
mckay,
in
one
of
his
articles
entitled
“reapportionment
reappraised,”
has
himself
said
that
legislative
representation
lines
are
never
neutral.
if
you
look
at
any
one
district,
you
could
always
argue
that
if
the
lines
were
drawn
to
the
left
two
blocks
or
to
the
right
three
blocks,
party
a
or
party
b
might
have
won
the
election.
what
i
think
of
one
terms
of
gerrymandering
is
the
definition
which
is
found
in
the
encyclopedia
of
social
sciences,
which
i
have
set
forth
in
my
brief,
and
this
speaks
of
the
abuse
of
power
by
a
party
that
is
dominant
at
the
time
in
the
legislature
so
as
to
maximize
its
political
strength
throughout
the
state.
now,
no
one
has
shown
that
there
was
any
abuse
under
new
york's
present
lines.
in
terms
of
political
realities,
they
could
have
been
an
abuse
because
the
democratic
party
controlled
the
state
assembly
and
the
republican
party
controlled
the
state
senate.
the
only
two
examples
that
appellant
has
been
able
to
point
so
are
the
35th
district
and
the
6th
district.
now,
the
35th
district
is
located
in
the
lower
central
valley
of
new
york.
it's
this
district
right
here.
it
is
rather
an
elongated
district
and
i
admit
it
is
not
esthetically
pleasing
if
the
lines
are
viewed
in
the
abstract,
but
it
is
a
perfectly
logical
district.
it
consists
of
eight
agrarian
counties.
they
are
all
small
in
population.
the
boundaries
of
the
district,
exactly
follows
the
boundaries
of
these
counties
and,
as
for
the
argument
that
this
was
drawn
with
some
partisan
intent
and
view,
as
upon
counsel
has
conceded,
although
it
was
expected
to
produce
a
republican
congressman
in
each
of
the
four
elections
that
have
taken
place
since
this
district
was
created.
the
democratic
candidate
has
won
the
election.
turning
to
queens,
we
have
the
example
of
the
6th
congressional
district,
and
what
appellant
is
basically
arguing
is
that
if
the
6th
district
was
drawing
somewhat
differently,
a
republican
candidate
might
not
have
won
that
district.
again,
in
terms
of
realities,
i
doubt
there's
very
much
because,
in
the
last
election,
the
republican
congressman,
they
carry
the
district
by
a
margin
of
2-1.
in
fact,
it
is
misleading
when
you
come
to
new
york
city,
just
talking
in
terms
of
republican
as
against
democratic.
the
people
of
new
york
city
are
quite
sophisticated
in
who
they
vote
for.
that
particular
candidate
is
a
republican
but
he
happens
to
have
a
very
liberal
persuasion
and
he
happens
to
draw
a
large
number
of
votes
from
democrats
and
independents.
what
appellant
tries
to
seize
upon
is
the
fact
that,
at
the
hearing
below,
a
witness
representing
the
majority
leader
of
the
state
senate
said
that
he
saw
nothing
wrong
with
a
district,
the
6th
district,
electing
a
republican
congressman.
what
he
was
saying,
if
his
remarks
are
read
in
the
full
context,
was
that
the
republican
party
generally
captures
about
43%
of
the
vote
in
the
borough
of
queens.
therefore,
he
couldn't
see
anything
wrong
in
having
them
elect
one
candidate
in
the
four
districts
that
are
allotted
to
queens.
in
fact,
if
the
democrats
won
all
four
districts,
the
argument
could've
been
made
that
this
was
not
fair
and
effective
representation.
now,
finally,
i
would
like
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
the
fact
that,
regardless
of
the
outcome
of
this
appeal,
new
york
will
have
to
draw
a
new
congressional
districting
lines
after
the
1970
census
because,
according
to
all
projections
of
the
united
states
census
bureau,
the
state
of
the
new
york
really
lose
at
least
one
congressional
seat.
we
feel
the
present
act
is
constitutional.
we
would
just
report.
if
this
court,
however,
should
feel
that
there
is
any
defect
in
any
of
these
lines,
we
would
ask
that,
under
equitable
considerations,
the
drawing
of
new
lines
be
deferred
until
the
1970
census
figures
are
available.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
i
would
imagine
that
would
be
in
1971.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
no,
i
would
say
that
the
1972
election
will
be
held
under
new
lines.
certainly,
i
think
the
legislature
should
have
the
figures
by
the
end
of
1971,
even
if
we
have
to
pay
more
money
to
get
them.
i
might
say
that
--
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
this
would
carry
through
--
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
well
for
one
more
election.
if
there
are
no
further
questions?
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
no.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
right,
this
is
the
--
that
argument
does
not
--
well,
of
course,
disparities
might
be
one
example,
but
let
me
--
as
--
while
you're
bringing
that
up,
let
me
begin
to
turn
to
the
example
in
the
adirondacks
where
we
said
that
lewis
was
kept
in
the
31st
district,
not
in
the
32nd.
now,
this
entire
area
here
is
republican.
the
republican
candidates
for
congress
captured
both
the
31sth
and
the
38th
districts
by
very
large
margins.
so,
the
reason
that
the
--
that
lewis
county
was
kept
in
the
31st
certainly
was
not
for
partisan
reasons.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
the
31st.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
yes.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
basically,
yes.
in
fact,
lewis
county,
what
occured
--
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
well,
as
i
said,
the
idea
there
was
to
try
to
get
a
congressman
who
would
represent
the
dominant
position
in
this
area.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
what
we
were
looking
for
were
logical
districts,
i
--
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
not
if
it
created
--
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
no,
your
honor,
not
if
it
created
large
disparities
in
population.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
well,
one
basic
--
this
is
the
--
this
area
is
agrarian.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
and
they
have
been
together
for
many
years
in
one
particular
district.
this
is
what
the
people
wanted
of
their
representatives.
this
is
the
brochure
that
was
brought
to
the
new
york
legislature.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
i'm
not
saying
that
the
legislature
was
required
to
order
that
--
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
in
every
case.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
what
i'm
saying
here
is
--
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
where
there
are
not
disparities
in
population
of
any
appreciable
extent
and
where
this
is
in
an
area
of
the
state
where
it's
not
logically
where
the
people
want
this.
where
this
is
the
impression
that
they
bring
to
bear
on
the
legislature.
otherwise,
if
the
legislature
--
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
that
would
be
rather
difficult
if
we
key
to
the
principle
of
contiguity.
what
i'm
saying
is
that,
i
believe,
to
try
to
get
fair
and
effective
representation,
it
may
not
impermissible
in
states
like
new
york
to
give
recognition
to
some
of
these
interests.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
no,
your
honor.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
no,
this
is
--
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
this
is
just
a
view
point,
but
i
don't
feel
the
ar
--
the
gerrymandering
argument,
i
feel,
is
so
weak
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
that,
on
throwing
this
in
as
--
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
on
the
strong?
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
well,
certainly,
we
have
--
when
we
talk
about
partisans
gerrymandering,
one
for
the
little
party
as
opposed
to
another,
and
there
really
is
no
argument
that
could
be
made
in
the
new
lines
of
the
31st
district.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
well,
that
only
played
in
elements
in
this
regard,
your
honor,
that
since
they
thought
there
would
be
new
district
lines
after
the
1970
census,
they
thought
it
would
be
foolish
to
completely
wipe
all
the
old
districts
off
the
map
and
start
in
a
vacuum.
they
thought
it
would
be
desirable
to
make
as
few
changes
as
possible
rather
than
have
three
completely
different
changes
in
congressional
constituencies
within
about
a
six-year
period.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
they
should
be
adhered
to,
to
the
extent
possible,
to
protect
against
the
gerrymander.
now,
the
question
was
raised
by
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
yes,
sir.
