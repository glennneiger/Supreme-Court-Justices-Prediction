mr.
robert
b.
mckay
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
first
to
introduce
mr.
david
wells,
the
plaintiff-appellant
in
this
case
who,
through
the
generosity
of
the
clerk’s
office
has
been
allowed
to
participate
with
me
as
an
adviser
even
though
he
is
not
a
member
of
this
bar
or
any
bar
but,
he
is
a
man
of
great
knowledge
in
the
field
of
congressional
districting,
particularly
in
new
york.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
three-judge
federal
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
dismissing
the
suit
that
had
been
brought
by
mr.
wells
in
1966
in
challenging
the
then
1961
congressional
districting
statute
in
new
york.
the
present
appeal
is
from
the
judgment
and
order
of
1968
upholding
and,
therefore,
dismissing
the
complaint
in
connection
with
the
1968
congressional
districting
statute
of
new
york.
in
a
sense,
this
case
picks
up
where
the
missouri
case,
which
we’ve
just
heard
argument,
leaves
off.
it
may
respect
it
as
quite
different
because,
in
this
case,
unlike
the
missouri
case,
the
legislative
posture
was
totally
different.
there
was
no
debate
in
the
legislature
of
any
consequence.
there
was
only
one
plan
presented
which
had
been
prepared
by
a
joint
legislative
committee
on
reapportionment
in
camera,
was
presented,
and
was
passed
without
essential
debate.
the
population
disparities
between
the
smallest
and
the
largest
districts
are
more
than
twice
as
great
as
in
the
missouri
case.
and,
specifically
in
this
case,
the
appellant
has
claimed
throughout
that
there
is
a
deviation
that
is
so
substantial
that
requires
justification,
but
the
justifications
given
by
the
state
are
unsatisfactory
and,
further,
that
there
is
a
lack
of
compactness
and
that
the
reasons
for
that
are
explained
by
affirmative
evidence
in
the
record
showing
that
there
was
a
partisan
objective
leading
to
the
particular
district
lines
that
were
drawn.
this
case,
thus,
raises
two
principle
questions
that
are
related
but
separable.
the
first
is,
where
there
are
population
deviations
that
are
not
de
minimis,
what
is
necessary
for
the
state
in
order
to
satisfy
its
burden
of
justification.
second,
where
the
districts
are
not
as
compact
as
they
could
have
been
and
there's
affirmative
evidence
of
a
gerrymander
for
partisan
or,
in
this
case,
perhaps
bipartisan
purposes,
is
the
plan
unconstitutional.
the
suit
was
originally
filed
in
1966
in
challenge
to
the
last
previous
congressional
districting
statute
in
new
york
which
dated
from
the
year
1961.
in
may
of
1967,
the
three-judge
court
held
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
and
that
decision
was
affirmed
by
this
court
in
december
of
1967.
the
three-judge
court
held
that
the
population
deviations
were
excessive
and
they
were,
indeed,
very
substantial
at
that
time.
it
suggested
also
that
there
was
“a
seemingly
bizarre
structure
among
the
congressional
districts,”
and
so
the
court
advised
that,
in
redrawing
the
lines,
the
legislature
should
draw
congressional
districts
that
are
“reasonably
compact
and
contiguous.”
and,
the
legislature
was
warned
not
to
allow
“considerations
of
race,
sex,
economic
status,
or
politics
to
cross
their
minds.”
how
well
the
new
york
legislature
obeyed
that
injunction,
we
shall
see.
the
1968
act
was
prepared
by
a
small
group
of
legislators
in
the
joint
legislative
committee
on
reapportionment,
and
the
drafting
was
largely
in
the
hands
of
advisers
to
the
leading
republican
and
democratic
figures
concerned
with
this
particular
matter
at
the
time
in
new
--
in
the
state
of
new
york.
the
plan
was
introduced
on
february
20
in
response
to
a
determination
by
a
three-judge
district
court
that
the
new
plan
must
be
drafted
and
presented
by
march
1,
1968.
it
was
discussed
briefly,
but
not
really
debated
in
both
houses
of
the
new
york
legislature
on
february
26,
passed
after
a
10-minute
debate
in
the
senate
and
a
slightly
longer
but
perfunctory
debate
in
the
assembly.
it
was
signed
by
the
governor
90
minutes
after
it
had
been
passed
by
the
second
house.
there
were
substantial
majorities
for
the
legislation
in
both
houses
and
by
both
parties
in
each
house.
there
was
no
real
doubt
as
to
the
decision
made
in
advance
that
this
was
the
legislation
that
would
be
accepted
by
the
new
york
state
legislature
in
1968.
the
principles
of
congressional
districting
that
had
been
outlined
by
this
court
or
that
are,
we
believe,
in
the
prospect
of
being
defined
are
several.
first,
substantial
population
equality
is
required.
second,
to
the
extent
that
there
is
comparison
with
state
legislative
reapportionment,
the
deviations
for
congressional
districsing--
districts
should
be
and
ordinarily
will
be
smaller
than
in
state
legislative
districting.
third,
the
deviations
must
be
explained
on
rational
and
permissible
grounds
and
know,
it
seems
to
us,
that
there
are
emerging
principles
which
will
be
tested
in
part
by
this
case.
the
deviations
from
compactness
also
must
be
explained
by
the
legislative
body
or
by
those
who
support
the
legislation.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
yes,
sir.
in
reynolds
versus
sims,
the
majority
opinion
stated
that
there
might
be
a
larger
toleration
for
deviations
in
state
legislative
representation
districts
than
in
congressional
because,
ordinarily,
there
are
a
larger
number
of
districts
to
be
drawn
in
a
state
legislative
chamber
than
in
the
congressional
s--
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
no,
i
think
not
because
the
necessity
of
the
opportunity
to
draw
so
many
different
districts,
there
is
more
opportunity
to
play
with
the
population
figures
of
this
point,
in
a
sense
that
mr.
achtenberg
made
in
connection
with
missouri.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
smaller
building
blocks
and
more
of
them,
yes,
sir.
emerging
principles--
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
excuse
me.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
it's
constitutionally
required
is
the
way
i
would
state
it.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
yes.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
yes,
there
is.
i
can
find
the
specific
section.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
it
is
in
the
brief,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
the
immerging
principles,
as
we
see
them,
are
that,
when
there
are
deviations
from
compactness,
that
there
must
be
--
this
also
must
be
explained
by
the
state
because
it
is
impossible
to
have
equality
without
being
tested
in
a
sense,
at
least
by
the
measure
of
compactness,
a
point
i
shall
return
to.
and,
finally,
we
suggest
that
a
gerrymander
for
a
racial,
religious,
socioeconomic,
or
partisan
purposes
is
or
should
be
forbidden
by
the
constitution.
let
me
speak
first
to
the
question
of
deviations
from
equality
as
it
affects
this
particular
case.
it
seems
to
us,
it
manifests
that
the
deviations
in
this
case
are
not
de
minimis
by
any
standard
whatsoever.
the
deviation
from
the
smallest
to
the
largest
congressional
district
in
the
state
of
new
york
under
the
1968
act
is
more
than
53,000
persons.
this
is
a
difference
in
percentage
point
from
the
smallest,
the
least
populous,
to
the
most
populous
district
of
over
14%.
even
adjoining
districts
sometimes
have
population
deviations
as
great
as
50,000
where
it
would've
been
perfectly
possible
to
reduce
the
figure,
as
i
shall
suggest
later,
to
a
very
small
figure
indeed.
indeed,
it
would've
been
possible
to
change
the
--
one
of
the
substantial
deviations
between
adjoining
districts
from
40,000-plus
to
5,000-plus
by
the
shift
of
a
single
county.
and,
now,
if
you
will
refer,
i
can
show
you
where
this
is,
to
appendix
b
in
the
--
yes,
i
can
do
it,
on
the
map
that's
now
behind
me
as
well.
it's
also
in
appendix
b
in
the
appellant's
brief.
lewis
county,
which
is
now
in
the
31st
district,
could've
been
shifted
to
the
32nd
district,
thus,
also
increasing
or
improving
the
compactness
of
the
32nd
district
with
a
difference
in
population
of
instead
of
40,000-plus
to
5,000-plus.
if
a
further
shift
had
been
made
hilton
county,
which
is
here,
to
the
32nd
district,
the
population
deviation
would've
been
reduced
to
under-2,000.
but,
in
that
particular
case,
there
would've
been
some
sacrifice
of
compactness.
we
do
not
urge
it,
but
simply
point
out
that
this
would've
been
possible
without
any
other
change
in
the
state
lines
in
that
particular
area.
on
the
deviation
from
equality
point,
it
should
be
noted
that
there
is
no
decision
of
this
court
that
has
approved
a
population
deviation
as
large
as
the
one
that
exists
in
the
state
of
new
york
now.
as
to
make
clear
from
the
missouri
case
already
discussed,
the
only
two
cases
in
which
this
court
has
recently
affirmed
a
decision
with
a
population
deviation
of
any
substantial
figure
have
been
in
the
mississippi
and
the
florida
cases
and
in
neither
of
those
was
the
population
deviation
as
large
as
in
the
new
york
case.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
the
legislation
thought
it
was
8,000-plus.
when
the
actual
figures
were
made
available,
it
turned
out
to
be
48,000-plus.
now,
i
do
not
make
anything
particular.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
yes,
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
it
turned
out
to
be
something
like
48,000.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
i
have
assumed
--
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
i'm
not
sure
of
this.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
i
think
this
court,
at
the
time
of
affirmance,
had
the
figures
of
48,000,
but
i
would
have
to
verify
that.
if
that
is
wrong,
i
will
let
you
know.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
yes,
yes
sir,
from
the
smallest
to
the
largest.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
over
14%.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
both
are
available.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
if
you
want
the
deviations
from
the
ideal,
the
figure
in
this
case
would
be
6.6
in
one
direction
and
6.5
in
the
other
direction.
but,
the
more
dramatic
figure,
of
course,
is
the
total
deviation
--
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
i
think
they
are
both
relevant
and
i
would
be
glad
to
stand
on
either
of
them
as
showing
a
very
substantial
and,
we
think,
impermissible
deviation
in
this
case.
my
present
point
is
only
that
it
is
not
de
minimis
and
that,
thus,
under
swann
versus
adams
and
other
decisions
in
this
court
and
elsewhere,
it
becomes
necessary
for
the
state
to
explain
what
the
reasons
for
those
deviations
were.
and,
it's
here
that
i
believe
that
the
state
has
failed
to
give
any
satisfactory
explanation.
no
explanation
will
hold
up
at
all.
let
me
talk
then
briefly
to
the
explanations
that
the
state
has
sought
to
give
and
suggest
why
each
of
them
is
inadequate
and
not
sufficient
constitutionally.
the
state
asserts,
in
the
first
place,
that
the
plan
took
into
account
regional
differences
throughout
the
state
of
new
york.
this
would
obviously
be
of
some
significance.
the
difficulty
is
that
the
plan
is
not
consistent
in
that
standard.
there
are
substantial
unexplained
departures
from
the
notion
of
regionality
or
from
the
notion
that
they
also
assert
of
the
desirability
of
preserving
political
subdivision
lines,
counties,
cities,
and
towns
were
possible.
let
me
give
examples.
the
state's
plan,
that
is
the
plan
in
new
york
the
present
time,
divides
unnecessarily
the
cities
of
yonkers
in
westchester
county,
just
north
of
new
york
city,
and
lackawanna,
just
south
of
buffalo,
divides
much
more
substantially
than
necessary
the
city
of
rochester
in
upper
central
new
york.
it
divides
unnecessary
the
town
of
islip
on
long
island,
and
it
divides
in
ways
that
we
think
are
undesirable
but
make
no
particular
point
of
part
of
the
boroughs
in
the
city
of
new
york.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
yes,
sir.
the
reason
for
that
--
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
that's
part
right.
again,
from
reynolds
and
sims
and
through
the
more
recent
cases,
it's
been
perfectly
clear
that
one
of
the
factors
that
can
be
taken
into
account
in
justifying
populish
--
population
deviations
of
small
amounts
is
the
desirability
of
protecting
against
the
gerrymander,
and
one
way
of
protecting
against
the
gerrymander
is
to
use
whole
political
subdivision
units
so
that
there
can
be
no
chart
that
the
lines
are
drawn
in
ways
that
cannot
be
checked
out.
but,
in
the
state
of
new
york,
the
state
legislative
act
here
in
question
has
unquestionably
divided
towns
and
cities
in
ways
that
were
not
necessary.
i
suggest
not
necessary
because
the
appellant
himself
has
devised
a
plan
which
has
been
before
the
court
throughout
which
he
does
not
assert
is
the
best
plan,
does
not
suggest
is
one
that
should
be
approved
by
this
court
or
by
the
legislature,
but
simply
to
show
that,
on
the
basis
of
an
entire
plan
for
the
state
of
new
york,
it
is
possible
to
draw
a
plan
that
is
more
compact,
more
equal,
and
does
not
divide
any
town
or
city
that
is
not
required
to
be
divided
because
of
a
substantiality
of
the
population
of
that
town,
county,
or
city.
so
that,
all
these
things
have
to
be
explained
by
the
states
and
they
have
not
done
so
on
the
basis
certainly
of
originality.
take,
for
example,
the
35th
congressional
district
which
stretches
from
virtually
the
outskirts
of
rochester
all
the
way
over
virtually
to
schenectady,
a
stretch
of
more
of
about
200
miles,
more
than
two-thirds
of
the
whole
state.
now,
we
have
some
reason
to
know
what
the
basis
for
this
district
drawing
was
when
it
was
first
drawn
in
1951.
it
was
designed,
according
to
the
popular
legend
in
new
york,
which
i
have
no
reason
to
doubt,
to
make
impossible
the
election
of
a
democratic
congressman.
in
fact,
the
democratic
congressman
has
been
elected
every
time
since
then.
so,
the
purpose
failed
but
there
still
remains
no
logic
to
that
district,
except
now
as
a
means
of
protecting
the
incumbent
in
that
particular
office.
it
is
not
a
region.
it
is
not
the
mohawk
valley,
as
was
asserted
by
witnesses
before
the
hearing
below.
it
is
not
land
or
area
within
the
state
of
new
york
that
makes
any
particular
sense,
except
for
the
political
reasons
for
which
it
was
originally
drawn
and
has
now
been
continued.
the
state
has
suggested
that
it
is
appropriate
to
consider
the
so-called
blue-lined
counties
together.
the
blue
line
is
essentially
the
line
drawn
around
the
adirondack
preserve
in
upper
northeastern
new
york,
and
that
is
the
justification
they
say
for
not
drawing
the
district
lines
somewhat
more
consistently
with
compactness
and
population
as
appellant
has
suggested
but,
in
fact,
the
very
counties
that
are
at
issue
here,
lewis
county,
to
which
reference
has
been
made
before
is
in
the
state
legislative
districts
joined
with
a
non-adirondack
county
or
neither,
which
is
a
mohawk
valley
county.
so,
there
is,
again,
no
consistency
of
approach
to
the
state.
there
is,
we
believe,
no
justification
for
the
lives
which
have
been
drawn
that
the
state
has
satisfactory
advanced
in
any
of
these
points.
the
state
also
argues
that
there
is
a
factor
of
legislative
convenience.
perhaps,
this
is
the
legislative
function
consideration
that
was
discussed
in
the
missouri
case.
they
say
the
time
was
too
short
to
device
a
better
plan,
but
the
time,
i
called
to
their
attention,
was
from
may
of
1967
when
the
1961
plan
was
held
unconstitutional
until
march
1,
1968,
the
deadline
imposed
by
the
court.
there
was,
indeed,
time
to
draw
a
more
comprehensive
and
more
equal
equality-serving
plan.
they
suggest
the
necessity
of
preserving
the
election
district's
hope
and
this,
of
course,
is
a
valid
consideration
to
minimize
the
dislocation
of
a
new
plan.
appellant,
in
drawing
his
plan,
did
not
use
election
districts
because
he
did
not
have,
unlike
the
state,
the
population
of
the
election
districts.
but,
it
could've
been
done
just
as
well
with
election
districts
as
with
census
tracks
with
which
he
largely
worked.
and
so,
again,
this
is
a
factor
that
could've
been
satisfied
perfectly
well
in
a
plan
that
would
have
met
the
equality
and
the
compactness
standards
which
we
believe
are
appropriate.
it
is
asserted
also
that
this
is
the
best
plan
that
could've
been
secured,
but
note
that,
unlike
missouri,
there
was
no
legislative
compromise
factor
involved
here.
the
plan
was
produced
and
was
presented
to
the
legislators
on
a
take
it-or-leave
it
basis,
and
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
they
were
expected
to
take
it.
both
parties
had
agreed
in
advance
that
this
was
the
plan
that
would
best
satisfy
the
give
and
take
of
the
political
and
the
legislative
process
and
so,
it
was
passed
without
any
substantial
dissent
in
both
houses.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
thus,
distinguishing
it
from
what
had
been
the
previous
situation
in
new
york
and
in
most
states
where
both
houses
are
of
a
single
party
where
the
plan
is
worked
out
by
that
party
and
presented
the
legislature,
and
then
that
seems
to
have
been
the
case
indeed
in
missouri,
but
the
dissent,
the
dispute
of
the
minority
is
unavailable
in
those
cases
but,
here,
it
was
necessary
to
give
something
to
both
parties
in
order
to
make
the
plan
acceptable
legislatively.
further,
i
call
to
your
attention,
and
here
you
will
have
to
look
at
appendix
b,
the
map
of
queens
in
new
york
city
which
is
on
that
map.
the
6th
and
the
8th
congressional
districts,
if
they
were
to
be
added
together,
could
be
a
reasonably
compact
almost
circular
area
but,
as
you
would
notice,
they
had
been
drawn
as
the
interlocking
wedges
as
though
of
two
wrenches
working
together.
the
question
is
why
they
were
drawn
in
that
fashion.
the
perfectly
clear
answer
is
that
the
6th
district
is
a
republican
district
and
was
intended
to
be
so.
the
8th
district
is
a
democratic
district
and
was
intended
to
be
so.
i
shall
advert
later
in
connection
with
my
argument
or
gerrymander
to
the
exact
evidence
that
shows
that
that
was
not
only
the
result,
but
as
well
the
intent.
let
me
turn
now
to
the
question
of
gerrymander
to
which
these
arguments
are,
i
believe,
inextricably
linked.
here,
the
question
is
deviation
from
equality
and
deviation
from
compactness,
and
the
burden,
i
believe,
being
on
the
state
to
explain
both
in
the
rather
extreme
circumstances
here
presented.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
it
--
well
--
it
shows
only
in
the
extreme
left-hand
corner,
just
the
very
tiniest
touch
of
the
lower
left-hand
map.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
do
you
see
the
little
line
going
from
the
two
there?
that's
the
verrazano
bridge,
and
to
the
left
of
that
is
richmond,
but
it
doesn't
appear
here.
richmond,
intact,
is
a
part
of
the
16th
congressional
district.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
but
it's
not
large
enough
by
itself
to
justify
a
full
district,
so
it's
linked
through
the
verrazano
bridge
to
part
of
brooklyn.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
the
gerrymander,
as
is
well
known,
is
that
device
by
which
a
legislature
seeks
to
add
to
or
diminish
the
power
of
a
political
group,
a
racial
group,
a
socioeconomic
group,
a
religious
group,
or
any
other
kind
of
group
interest.
and,
it
is
this
that
we
believe
is
demonstrated
in
this
case
and
it
is
this
that
we
believe
must
be
prohibited
in
terms
of
the
constitutional
philosophy
that's
here
involved.
whether
speaking
in
terms
of
article
1
section
2
of
the
constitution,
as
in
wesberry
versus
sanders
or
in
terms
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
we
believe
that
a
gerrymander
designed
to
favor
or
to
disfavor
some
identifiable
group
is
constitutionally
impermissible.
the
state
has
argued,
i
think
not
very
strongly
but
it
should
be
mentioned,
that
there
is
a
doubt
as
to
the
justiciability
of
the
gerrymander
issue.
the
reliance
there
is
on
bits
and
pieces
out
of
lower
federal
court
decisions
and
state
courts
with
one
exception,
that's
the
affirmance
by
this
court
of
the
decision
in
wmca
versus
lomenzo
in
which
there
was
a
per
curiam
affirmance
of
a
decision
of
a
three-judge
district
court
below
in
which,
among
various
points,
the
court
had
suggested
that
the
gerrymander
was
not
a
justiciable
issue.
but,
the
affirmance
per
curiam
seems
equally
susceptible
to
the
point
that
this
court
was
not
satisfied
that
there
was
sufficient
proof
of
a
gerrymander
in
that
case
to
warrant
taking
it
up
on
that
particular
issue.
it
becomes
particularly
unlikely
that
the
court
has
determined
that
the
issue
is
not
justiciable
in
view
of
the
fact
that
wmca
was
bracketed
in
time
by
fortson
versus
dorsey
from
georgia
and
burns
versus
richardson
from
hawaii.
in
each
of
which,
the
court
explicitly
recognized
the
possibility
that,
in
proper
circumstances,
there
might
be
racial
or
political
gerrymandering
taken
into
account
as
a
basis
for
a
holding
of
unconstitutionality.
this,
we
believe,
is
a
case
in
which
those
factors
are
sufficiently
evident
both
affirmatively
and
negatively
by
inference
to
justify
the
imposition
of
that
rule
in
this
particular
case.
the
proof
of
the
gerrymander
in
circumstances
of
this
case,
i
think,
deserves
some
mention
at
this
point.
the
circumstances
of
the
development
of
the
1968
legislative
plan
and
of
its
passage
through
the
legislature
suggest
that
there
was
a
bipartisan
agreement
to
protect
encumbrance
and
to
tradeoff
to
make
sure
that
individuals
favored
by
the
legislative
leaders
in
both
parties
would
be
assured
as
nearly
as
may
be
of
a
continuance
of
their
seat
or
of
the
giving
of
a
new
seat
in
the
congress
to
be
elected
in
1968.
there
was
unwavering
bipartisan
support
for
the
bill
by
substantial
majorities
in
both
houses.
the
principal
republican
and
democratic
architects
of
the
plan
both
testified
in
its
favor
in
the
hearing
before
the
three-judge
district
court
below,
and
the
evidence
as
to
the
6th
and
8th
congressional
districts
indicates
very
clearly
that
they
were
drawn
so
as
to
ensure
a
republican
preponderance
in
the
6th
and
a
democratic
preponderance
in
the
8th.
now,
that's
a
point
that
i
would
like
to
return
in
the
time
that
i
have
reserved,
if
i
may
leave
it
at
that
junction.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
no,
sir,
there
was
none.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
may
it
please
the
court.
two
brief
specific
points,
one
in
response
to
mr.
justice
white's
earlier
question
about
gong
versus
kirk.
as
i
see
the
district
court
opinion
in
that
case,
which
is
at
278
f.
supp.
133
which
i
believe
is
the
one
that
was
affirmed
by
this
court,
the
reference
there
is
to
the
disparity
in
population
of
only
8,000.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
now,
whether
there
is
something
else
was
developed
between
the
time
of
the
--
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
yes,
sir,
i
would.
it
is
emphasized
and
exaggerated
by
the
two
facts
of
substantial
population
deviations,
otherwise
unexplained,
and
the
lack
of
compactness
--
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
which
makes
the
districting
suspect
and
then
there
is
also
affirmative
evidence
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
yes,
sir,
at
least
in
part.
now,
let
me
give
some
examples
of
that,
if
i
may.
perhaps
i
should
first
make
reference
to
the
citation
to
my
own
writing
on
the
fact
that
the
drawing
of
political
lines
is
never
neutral,
of
course,
that's
true,
but
the
objective
in
the
constitution
and
of
the
earlier
decisions
of
this
court,
as
i
understand
it,
is
to
make
sure
that
it'd
be
as
neutral
as
possible
and
it'd
be
as
free
of
erroneous
non-permissible
considerations
as
possible.
we
go
then
right
to
the
question
of
whether
it's
permissible
to
have
a
conservationist
viewpoint
represented
or
a
religious
viewpoint
represented
or
a
congressman
who
represents
a
racial
or
socioeconomic
or
political
--
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
or
urban
district.
without
the
urban
districts,
it
pretty
well
will
be
represented
where
you
have
a
substantial
city
and,
indeed,
it
would
be
my
own
belief
that,
as
far
as
possible,
to
protect
against
gerrymandering
the
city
should
be
kept
intact.
the
district
lines,
whether
it'd
be
cities
or
counties
or
townships
or
whatever
the
case
may
be,
should
be
adhered
to
where
possible,
and
that
is
what
has
not
been
done
in
new
york
city
in
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
we
make
both
arguments,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
we
make
both
arguments,
but
there
are
substantial
population
inequalities
that
are
not
explained
by
any
rationally
permissible
ground
and
that
there
is
a
gerrymander.
that
is
--
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
on
both
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
article
1
section
2.
fair
representation
of
the
vote
by
the
people
is
within
article
1
section
2
and
that,
of
course,
means
equality
and
fairness,
and
the
equal
protection
clause,
of
course,
means
that
there
shall
not
be
arbitrarily
drawn
districts.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
quite
correct.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
compactness
and
contiguity.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
no,
there
was
not.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
no
decision
at
that
point.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
whether
it
was
raised,
i'm
not
sure,
but
there
was
no
decision
on
that
point.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
and
contiguity,
i
think,
quite
clearly
that
--
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
there
isn't
a
contiguity
problem
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
it's
--
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
i
believe
it's
a
function
of
the
equality
argument.
our
propositions
then
would
run
this
way,
that
equality
--
substantial
equality
is
required.
in
this
case,
that
alone
would
be
enough
to
justify
reversal.
but,
in
addition,
in
order
to
make
the
equality
aspect
work,
as
someone
suggested,
it's
only
one
part
of
a
pair
of
pliers,
the
equality,
in
order
to
make
it
work,
there
must
also
be
protection
against
use
of
the
districting
process
for
impermissible
purposes,
else
equality
serves
no
real
function
of
itself.
and
so,
our
second
argument
is
that
equality
and
compactness
must
be
satisfied
in
reasonable
ways
and,
where
it
is
not
satisfied,
the
state
must
explain.
some
explanations
can
be
given
but,
in
this
case,
there
are
no
satisfactory
explanations
and,
indeed,
there
is
affirmative
evidence
of
a
conscious
intent
to
gerrymander
for
partisan
reasons.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
quite
--
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
quite
clearly
so.
and,
in
this
case,
there
is
an
addition.
the
affirmative
evidence
of
conscious
purpose
for
partisan
or
bipartisan
results
and,
in
addition,
as
mr.
zuckerman
has
just
conceded,
there
was
an
effort
to
secure
a
conservationist
district
which,
seems
to
me,
pervert
the
old
rural-urban
dichotomy
that
was
the
thrust
of
reynolds
versus
sims
originally.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
first
to
introduce
mr.
david
wells,
the
plaintiff-appellant
in
this
case
who,
through
the
generosity
of
the
clerk’s
office
has
been
allowed
to
participate
with
me
as
an
adviser
even
though
he
is
not
a
member
of
this
bar
or
any
bar
but,
he
is
a
man
of
great
knowledge
in
the
field
of
congressional
districting,
particularly
in
new
york.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
three-judge
federal
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
dismissing
the
suit
that
had
been
brought
by
mr.
wells
in
1966
in
challenging
the
then
1961
congressional
districting
statute
in
new
york.
the
present
appeal
is
from
the
judgment
and
order
of
1968
upholding
and,
therefore,
dismissing
the
complaint
in
connection
with
the
1968
congressional
districting
statute
of
new
york.
in
a
sense,
this
case
picks
up
where
the
missouri
case,
which
we’ve
just
heard
argument,
leaves
off.
it
may
respect
it
as
quite
different
because,
in
this
case,
unlike
the
missouri
case,
the
legislative
posture
was
totally
different.
there
was
no
debate
in
the
legislature
of
any
consequence.
there
was
only
one
plan
presented
which
had
been
prepared
by
a
joint
legislative
committee
on
reapportionment
in
camera,
was
presented,
and
was
passed
without
essential
debate.
the
population
disparities
between
the
smallest
and
the
largest
districts
are
more
than
twice
as
great
as
in
the
missouri
case.
and,
specifically
in
this
case,
the
appellant
has
claimed
throughout
that
there
is
a
deviation
that
is
so
substantial
that
requires
justification,
but
the
justifications
given
by
the
state
are
unsatisfactory
and,
further,
that
there
is
a
lack
of
compactness
and
that
the
reasons
for
that
are
explained
by
affirmative
evidence
in
the
record
showing
that
there
was
a
partisan
objective
leading
to
the
particular
district
lines
that
were
drawn.
this
case,
thus,
raises
two
principle
questions
that
are
related
but
separable.
the
first
is,
where
there
are
population
deviations
that
are
not
de
minimis,
what
is
necessary
for
the
state
in
order
to
satisfy
its
burden
of
justification.
second,
where
the
districts
are
not
as
compact
as
they
could
have
been
and
there's
affirmative
evidence
of
a
gerrymander
for
partisan
or,
in
this
case,
perhaps
bipartisan
purposes,
is
the
plan
unconstitutional.
the
suit
was
originally
filed
in
1966
in
challenge
to
the
last
previous
congressional
districting
statute
in
new
york
which
dated
from
the
year
1961.
in
may
of
1967,
the
three-judge
court
held
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
and
that
decision
was
affirmed
by
this
court
in
december
of
1967.
the
three-judge
court
held
that
the
population
deviations
were
excessive
and
they
were,
indeed,
very
substantial
at
that
time.
it
suggested
also
that
there
was
“a
seemingly
bizarre
structure
among
the
congressional
districts,”
and
so
the
court
advised
that,
in
redrawing
the
lines,
the
legislature
should
draw
congressional
districts
that
are
“reasonably
compact
and
contiguous.”
and,
the
legislature
was
warned
not
to
allow
“considerations
of
race,
sex,
economic
status,
or
politics
to
cross
their
minds.”
how
well
the
new
york
legislature
obeyed
that
injunction,
we
shall
see.
the
1968
act
was
prepared
by
a
small
group
of
legislators
in
the
joint
legislative
committee
on
reapportionment,
and
the
drafting
was
largely
in
the
hands
of
advisers
to
the
leading
republican
and
democratic
figures
concerned
with
this
particular
matter
at
the
time
in
new
--
in
the
state
of
new
york.
the
plan
was
introduced
on
february
20
in
response
to
a
determination
by
a
three-judge
district
court
that
the
new
plan
must
be
drafted
and
presented
by
march
1,
1968.
it
was
discussed
briefly,
but
not
really
debated
in
both
houses
of
the
new
york
legislature
on
february
26,
passed
after
a
10-minute
debate
in
the
senate
and
a
slightly
longer
but
perfunctory
debate
in
the
assembly.
it
was
signed
by
the
governor
90
minutes
after
it
had
been
passed
by
the
second
house.
there
were
substantial
majorities
for
the
legislation
in
both
houses
and
by
both
parties
in
each
house.
there
was
no
real
doubt
as
to
the
decision
made
in
advance
that
this
was
the
legislation
that
would
be
accepted
by
the
new
york
state
legislature
in
1968.
the
principles
of
congressional
districting
that
had
been
outlined
by
this
court
or
that
are,
we
believe,
in
the
prospect
of
being
defined
are
several.
first,
substantial
population
equality
is
required.
second,
to
the
extent
that
there
is
comparison
with
state
legislative
reapportionment,
the
deviations
for
congressional
districsing--
districts
should
be
and
ordinarily
will
be
smaller
than
in
state
legislative
districting.
third,
the
deviations
must
be
explained
on
rational
and
permissible
grounds
and
know,
it
seems
to
us,
that
there
are
emerging
principles
which
will
be
tested
in
part
by
this
case.
the
deviations
from
compactness
also
must
be
explained
by
the
legislative
body
or
by
those
who
support
the
legislation.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
yes,
sir.
in
reynolds
versus
sims,
the
majority
opinion
stated
that
there
might
be
a
larger
toleration
for
deviations
in
state
legislative
representation
districts
than
in
congressional
because,
ordinarily,
there
are
a
larger
number
of
districts
to
be
drawn
in
a
state
legislative
chamber
than
in
the
congressional
s--
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
no,
i
think
not
because
the
necessity
of
the
opportunity
to
draw
so
many
different
districts,
there
is
more
opportunity
to
play
with
the
population
figures
of
this
point,
in
a
sense
that
mr.
achtenberg
made
in
connection
with
missouri.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
smaller
building
blocks
and
more
of
them,
yes,
sir.
emerging
principles--
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
excuse
me.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
it's
constitutionally
required
is
the
way
i
would
state
it.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
yes.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
yes,
there
is.
i
can
find
the
specific
section.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
it
is
in
the
brief,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
the
immerging
principles,
as
we
see
them,
are
that,
when
there
are
deviations
from
compactness,
that
there
must
be
--
this
also
must
be
explained
by
the
state
because
it
is
impossible
to
have
equality
without
being
tested
in
a
sense,
at
least
by
the
measure
of
compactness,
a
point
i
shall
return
to.
and,
finally,
we
suggest
that
a
gerrymander
for
a
racial,
religious,
socioeconomic,
or
partisan
purposes
is
or
should
be
forbidden
by
the
constitution.
let
me
speak
first
to
the
question
of
deviations
from
equality
as
it
affects
this
particular
case.
it
seems
to
us,
it
manifests
that
the
deviations
in
this
case
are
not
de
minimis
by
any
standard
whatsoever.
the
deviation
from
the
smallest
to
the
largest
congressional
district
in
the
state
of
new
york
under
the
1968
act
is
more
than
53,000
persons.
this
is
a
difference
in
percentage
point
from
the
smallest,
the
least
populous,
to
the
most
populous
district
of
over
14%.
even
adjoining
districts
sometimes
have
population
deviations
as
great
as
50,000
where
it
would've
been
perfectly
possible
to
reduce
the
figure,
as
i
shall
suggest
later,
to
a
very
small
figure
indeed.
indeed,
it
would've
been
possible
to
change
the
--
one
of
the
substantial
deviations
between
adjoining
districts
from
40,000-plus
to
5,000-plus
by
the
shift
of
a
single
county.
and,
now,
if
you
will
refer,
i
can
show
you
where
this
is,
to
appendix
b
in
the
--
yes,
i
can
do
it,
on
the
map
that's
now
behind
me
as
well.
it's
also
in
appendix
b
in
the
appellant's
brief.
lewis
county,
which
is
now
in
the
31st
district,
could've
been
shifted
to
the
32nd
district,
thus,
also
increasing
or
improving
the
compactness
of
the
32nd
district
with
a
difference
in
population
of
instead
of
40,000-plus
to
5,000-plus.
if
a
further
shift
had
been
made
hilton
county,
which
is
here,
to
the
32nd
district,
the
population
deviation
would've
been
reduced
to
under-2,000.
but,
in
that
particular
case,
there
would've
been
some
sacrifice
of
compactness.
we
do
not
urge
it,
but
simply
point
out
that
this
would've
been
possible
without
any
other
change
in
the
state
lines
in
that
particular
area.
on
the
deviation
from
equality
point,
it
should
be
noted
that
there
is
no
decision
of
this
court
that
has
approved
a
population
deviation
as
large
as
the
one
that
exists
in
the
state
of
new
york
now.
as
to
make
clear
from
the
missouri
case
already
discussed,
the
only
two
cases
in
which
this
court
has
recently
affirmed
a
decision
with
a
population
deviation
of
any
substantial
figure
have
been
in
the
mississippi
and
the
florida
cases
and
in
neither
of
those
was
the
population
deviation
as
large
as
in
the
new
york
case.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
the
legislation
thought
it
was
8,000-plus.
when
the
actual
figures
were
made
available,
it
turned
out
to
be
48,000-plus.
now,
i
do
not
make
anything
particular.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
yes,
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
it
turned
out
to
be
something
like
48,000.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
i
have
assumed
--
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
i'm
not
sure
of
this.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
i
think
this
court,
at
the
time
of
affirmance,
had
the
figures
of
48,000,
but
i
would
have
to
verify
that.
if
that
is
wrong,
i
will
let
you
know.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
yes,
yes
sir,
from
the
smallest
to
the
largest.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
over
14%.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
both
are
available.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
if
you
want
the
deviations
from
the
ideal,
the
figure
in
this
case
would
be
6.6
in
one
direction
and
6.5
in
the
other
direction.
but,
the
more
dramatic
figure,
of
course,
is
the
total
deviation
--
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
i
think
they
are
both
relevant
and
i
would
be
glad
to
stand
on
either
of
them
as
showing
a
very
substantial
and,
we
think,
impermissible
deviation
in
this
case.
my
present
point
is
only
that
it
is
not
de
minimis
and
that,
thus,
under
swann
versus
adams
and
other
decisions
in
this
court
and
elsewhere,
it
becomes
necessary
for
the
state
to
explain
what
the
reasons
for
those
deviations
were.
and,
it's
here
that
i
believe
that
the
state
has
failed
to
give
any
satisfactory
explanation.
no
explanation
will
hold
up
at
all.
let
me
talk
then
briefly
to
the
explanations
that
the
state
has
sought
to
give
and
suggest
why
each
of
them
is
inadequate
and
not
sufficient
constitutionally.
the
state
asserts,
in
the
first
place,
that
the
plan
took
into
account
regional
differences
throughout
the
state
of
new
york.
this
would
obviously
be
of
some
significance.
the
difficulty
is
that
the
plan
is
not
consistent
in
that
standard.
there
are
substantial
unexplained
departures
from
the
notion
of
regionality
or
from
the
notion
that
they
also
assert
of
the
desirability
of
preserving
political
subdivision
lines,
counties,
cities,
and
towns
were
possible.
let
me
give
examples.
the
state's
plan,
that
is
the
plan
in
new
york
the
present
time,
divides
unnecessarily
the
cities
of
yonkers
in
westchester
county,
just
north
of
new
york
city,
and
lackawanna,
just
south
of
buffalo,
divides
much
more
substantially
than
necessary
the
city
of
rochester
in
upper
central
new
york.
it
divides
unnecessary
the
town
of
islip
on
long
island,
and
it
divides
in
ways
that
we
think
are
undesirable
but
make
no
particular
point
of
part
of
the
boroughs
in
the
city
of
new
york.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
yes,
sir.
the
reason
for
that
--
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
that's
part
right.
again,
from
reynolds
and
sims
and
through
the
more
recent
cases,
it's
been
perfectly
clear
that
one
of
the
factors
that
can
be
taken
into
account
in
justifying
populish
--
population
deviations
of
small
amounts
is
the
desirability
of
protecting
against
the
gerrymander,
and
one
way
of
protecting
against
the
gerrymander
is
to
use
whole
political
subdivision
units
so
that
there
can
be
no
chart
that
the
lines
are
drawn
in
ways
that
cannot
be
checked
out.
but,
in
the
state
of
new
york,
the
state
legislative
act
here
in
question
has
unquestionably
divided
towns
and
cities
in
ways
that
were
not
necessary.
i
suggest
not
necessary
because
the
appellant
himself
has
devised
a
plan
which
has
been
before
the
court
throughout
which
he
does
not
assert
is
the
best
plan,
does
not
suggest
is
one
that
should
be
approved
by
this
court
or
by
the
legislature,
but
simply
to
show
that,
on
the
basis
of
an
entire
plan
for
the
state
of
new
york,
it
is
possible
to
draw
a
plan
that
is
more
compact,
more
equal,
and
does
not
divide
any
town
or
city
that
is
not
required
to
be
divided
because
of
a
substantiality
of
the
population
of
that
town,
county,
or
city.
so
that,
all
these
things
have
to
be
explained
by
the
states
and
they
have
not
done
so
on
the
basis
certainly
of
originality.
take,
for
example,
the
35th
congressional
district
which
stretches
from
virtually
the
outskirts
of
rochester
all
the
way
over
virtually
to
schenectady,
a
stretch
of
more
of
about
200
miles,
more
than
two-thirds
of
the
whole
state.
now,
we
have
some
reason
to
know
what
the
basis
for
this
district
drawing
was
when
it
was
first
drawn
in
1951.
it
was
designed,
according
to
the
popular
legend
in
new
york,
which
i
have
no
reason
to
doubt,
to
make
impossible
the
election
of
a
democratic
congressman.
in
fact,
the
democratic
congressman
has
been
elected
every
time
since
then.
so,
the
purpose
failed
but
there
still
remains
no
logic
to
that
district,
except
now
as
a
means
of
protecting
the
incumbent
in
that
particular
office.
it
is
not
a
region.
it
is
not
the
mohawk
valley,
as
was
asserted
by
witnesses
before
the
hearing
below.
it
is
not
land
or
area
within
the
state
of
new
york
that
makes
any
particular
sense,
except
for
the
political
reasons
for
which
it
was
originally
drawn
and
has
now
been
continued.
the
state
has
suggested
that
it
is
appropriate
to
consider
the
so-called
blue-lined
counties
together.
the
blue
line
is
essentially
the
line
drawn
around
the
adirondack
preserve
in
upper
northeastern
new
york,
and
that
is
the
justification
they
say
for
not
drawing
the
district
lines
somewhat
more
consistently
with
compactness
and
population
as
appellant
has
suggested
but,
in
fact,
the
very
counties
that
are
at
issue
here,
lewis
county,
to
which
reference
has
been
made
before
is
in
the
state
legislative
districts
joined
with
a
non-adirondack
county
or
neither,
which
is
a
mohawk
valley
county.
so,
there
is,
again,
no
consistency
of
approach
to
the
state.
there
is,
we
believe,
no
justification
for
the
lives
which
have
been
drawn
that
the
state
has
satisfactory
advanced
in
any
of
these
points.
the
state
also
argues
that
there
is
a
factor
of
legislative
convenience.
perhaps,
this
is
the
legislative
function
consideration
that
was
discussed
in
the
missouri
case.
they
say
the
time
was
too
short
to
device
a
better
plan,
but
the
time,
i
called
to
their
attention,
was
from
may
of
1967
when
the
1961
plan
was
held
unconstitutional
until
march
1,
1968,
the
deadline
imposed
by
the
court.
there
was,
indeed,
time
to
draw
a
more
comprehensive
and
more
equal
equality-serving
plan.
they
suggest
the
necessity
of
preserving
the
election
district's
hope
and
this,
of
course,
is
a
valid
consideration
to
minimize
the
dislocation
of
a
new
plan.
appellant,
in
drawing
his
plan,
did
not
use
election
districts
because
he
did
not
have,
unlike
the
state,
the
population
of
the
election
districts.
but,
it
could've
been
done
just
as
well
with
election
districts
as
with
census
tracks
with
which
he
largely
worked.
and
so,
again,
this
is
a
factor
that
could've
been
satisfied
perfectly
well
in
a
plan
that
would
have
met
the
equality
and
the
compactness
standards
which
we
believe
are
appropriate.
it
is
asserted
also
that
this
is
the
best
plan
that
could've
been
secured,
but
note
that,
unlike
missouri,
there
was
no
legislative
compromise
factor
involved
here.
the
plan
was
produced
and
was
presented
to
the
legislators
on
a
take
it-or-leave
it
basis,
and
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
they
were
expected
to
take
it.
both
parties
had
agreed
in
advance
that
this
was
the
plan
that
would
best
satisfy
the
give
and
take
of
the
political
and
the
legislative
process
and
so,
it
was
passed
without
any
substantial
dissent
in
both
houses.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
thus,
distinguishing
it
from
what
had
been
the
previous
situation
in
new
york
and
in
most
states
where
both
houses
are
of
a
single
party
where
the
plan
is
worked
out
by
that
party
and
presented
the
legislature,
and
then
that
seems
to
have
been
the
case
indeed
in
missouri,
but
the
dissent,
the
dispute
of
the
minority
is
unavailable
in
those
cases
but,
here,
it
was
necessary
to
give
something
to
both
parties
in
order
to
make
the
plan
acceptable
legislatively.
further,
i
call
to
your
attention,
and
here
you
will
have
to
look
at
appendix
b,
the
map
of
queens
in
new
york
city
which
is
on
that
map.
the
6th
and
the
8th
congressional
districts,
if
they
were
to
be
added
together,
could
be
a
reasonably
compact
almost
circular
area
but,
as
you
would
notice,
they
had
been
drawn
as
the
interlocking
wedges
as
though
of
two
wrenches
working
together.
the
question
is
why
they
were
drawn
in
that
fashion.
the
perfectly
clear
answer
is
that
the
6th
district
is
a
republican
district
and
was
intended
to
be
so.
the
8th
district
is
a
democratic
district
and
was
intended
to
be
so.
i
shall
advert
later
in
connection
with
my
argument
or
gerrymander
to
the
exact
evidence
that
shows
that
that
was
not
only
the
result,
but
as
well
the
intent.
let
me
turn
now
to
the
question
of
gerrymander
to
which
these
arguments
are,
i
believe,
inextricably
linked.
here,
the
question
is
deviation
from
equality
and
deviation
from
compactness,
and
the
burden,
i
believe,
being
on
the
state
to
explain
both
in
the
rather
extreme
circumstances
here
presented.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
it
--
well
--
it
shows
only
in
the
extreme
left-hand
corner,
just
the
very
tiniest
touch
of
the
lower
left-hand
map.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
do
you
see
the
little
line
going
from
the
two
there?
that's
the
verrazano
bridge,
and
to
the
left
of
that
is
richmond,
but
it
doesn't
appear
here.
richmond,
intact,
is
a
part
of
the
16th
congressional
district.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
but
it's
not
large
enough
by
itself
to
justify
a
full
district,
so
it's
linked
through
the
verrazano
bridge
to
part
of
brooklyn.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
the
gerrymander,
as
is
well
known,
is
that
device
by
which
a
legislature
seeks
to
add
to
or
diminish
the
power
of
a
political
group,
a
racial
group,
a
socioeconomic
group,
a
religious
group,
or
any
other
kind
of
group
interest.
and,
it
is
this
that
we
believe
is
demonstrated
in
this
case
and
it
is
this
that
we
believe
must
be
prohibited
in
terms
of
the
constitutional
philosophy
that's
here
involved.
whether
speaking
in
terms
of
article
1
section
2
of
the
constitution,
as
in
wesberry
versus
sanders
or
in
terms
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
we
believe
that
a
gerrymander
designed
to
favor
or
to
disfavor
some
identifiable
group
is
constitutionally
impermissible.
the
state
has
argued,
i
think
not
very
strongly
but
it
should
be
mentioned,
that
there
is
a
doubt
as
to
the
justiciability
of
the
gerrymander
issue.
the
reliance
there
is
on
bits
and
pieces
out
of
lower
federal
court
decisions
and
state
courts
with
one
exception,
that's
the
affirmance
by
this
court
of
the
decision
in
wmca
versus
lomenzo
in
which
there
was
a
per
curiam
affirmance
of
a
decision
of
a
three-judge
district
court
below
in
which,
among
various
points,
the
court
had
suggested
that
the
gerrymander
was
not
a
justiciable
issue.
but,
the
affirmance
per
curiam
seems
equally
susceptible
to
the
point
that
this
court
was
not
satisfied
that
there
was
sufficient
proof
of
a
gerrymander
in
that
case
to
warrant
taking
it
up
on
that
particular
issue.
it
becomes
particularly
unlikely
that
the
court
has
determined
that
the
issue
is
not
justiciable
in
view
of
the
fact
that
wmca
was
bracketed
in
time
by
fortson
versus
dorsey
from
georgia
and
burns
versus
richardson
from
hawaii.
in
each
of
which,
the
court
explicitly
recognized
the
possibility
that,
in
proper
circumstances,
there
might
be
racial
or
political
gerrymandering
taken
into
account
as
a
basis
for
a
holding
of
unconstitutionality.
this,
we
believe,
is
a
case
in
which
those
factors
are
sufficiently
evident
both
affirmatively
and
negatively
by
inference
to
justify
the
imposition
of
that
rule
in
this
particular
case.
the
proof
of
the
gerrymander
in
circumstances
of
this
case,
i
think,
deserves
some
mention
at
this
point.
the
circumstances
of
the
development
of
the
1968
legislative
plan
and
of
its
passage
through
the
legislature
suggest
that
there
was
a
bipartisan
agreement
to
protect
encumbrance
and
to
tradeoff
to
make
sure
that
individuals
favored
by
the
legislative
leaders
in
both
parties
would
be
assured
as
nearly
as
may
be
of
a
continuance
of
their
seat
or
of
the
giving
of
a
new
seat
in
the
congress
to
be
elected
in
1968.
there
was
unwavering
bipartisan
support
for
the
bill
by
substantial
majorities
in
both
houses.
the
principal
republican
and
democratic
architects
of
the
plan
both
testified
in
its
favor
in
the
hearing
before
the
three-judge
district
court
below,
and
the
evidence
as
to
the
6th
and
8th
congressional
districts
indicates
very
clearly
that
they
were
drawn
so
as
to
ensure
a
republican
preponderance
in
the
6th
and
a
democratic
preponderance
in
the
8th.
now,
that's
a
point
that
i
would
like
to
return
in
the
time
that
i
have
reserved,
if
i
may
leave
it
at
that
junction.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
no,
sir,
there
was
none.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
may
it
please
the
court.
two
brief
specific
points,
one
in
response
to
mr.
justice
white's
earlier
question
about
gong
versus
kirk.
as
i
see
the
district
court
opinion
in
that
case,
which
is
at
278
f.
supp.
133
which
i
believe
is
the
one
that
was
affirmed
by
this
court,
the
reference
there
is
to
the
disparity
in
population
of
only
8,000.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
now,
whether
there
is
something
else
was
developed
between
the
time
of
the
--
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
yes,
sir,
i
would.
it
is
emphasized
and
exaggerated
by
the
two
facts
of
substantial
population
deviations,
otherwise
unexplained,
and
the
lack
of
compactness
--
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
which
makes
the
districting
suspect
and
then
there
is
also
affirmative
evidence
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
yes,
sir,
at
least
in
part.
now,
let
me
give
some
examples
of
that,
if
i
may.
perhaps
i
should
first
make
reference
to
the
citation
to
my
own
writing
on
the
fact
that
the
drawing
of
political
lines
is
never
neutral,
of
course,
that's
true,
but
the
objective
in
the
constitution
and
of
the
earlier
decisions
of
this
court,
as
i
understand
it,
is
to
make
sure
that
it'd
be
as
neutral
as
possible
and
it'd
be
as
free
of
erroneous
non-permissible
considerations
as
possible.
we
go
then
right
to
the
question
of
whether
it's
permissible
to
have
a
conservationist
viewpoint
represented
or
a
religious
viewpoint
represented
or
a
congressman
who
represents
a
racial
or
socioeconomic
or
political
--
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
or
urban
district.
without
the
urban
districts,
it
pretty
well
will
be
represented
where
you
have
a
substantial
city
and,
indeed,
it
would
be
my
own
belief
that,
as
far
as
possible,
to
protect
against
gerrymandering
the
city
should
be
kept
intact.
the
district
lines,
whether
it'd
be
cities
or
counties
or
townships
or
whatever
the
case
may
be,
should
be
adhered
to
where
possible,
and
that
is
what
has
not
been
done
in
new
york
city
in
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
we
make
both
arguments,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
we
make
both
arguments,
but
there
are
substantial
population
inequalities
that
are
not
explained
by
any
rationally
permissible
ground
and
that
there
is
a
gerrymander.
that
is
--
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
on
both
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
article
1
section
2.
fair
representation
of
the
vote
by
the
people
is
within
article
1
section
2
and
that,
of
course,
means
equality
and
fairness,
and
the
equal
protection
clause,
of
course,
means
that
there
shall
not
be
arbitrarily
drawn
districts.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
quite
correct.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
compactness
and
contiguity.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
no,
there
was
not.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
no
decision
at
that
point.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
whether
it
was
raised,
i'm
not
sure,
but
there
was
no
decision
on
that
point.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
and
contiguity,
i
think,
quite
clearly
that
--
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
there
isn't
a
contiguity
problem
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
it's
--
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
i
believe
it's
a
function
of
the
equality
argument.
our
propositions
then
would
run
this
way,
that
equality
--
substantial
equality
is
required.
in
this
case,
that
alone
would
be
enough
to
justify
reversal.
but,
in
addition,
in
order
to
make
the
equality
aspect
work,
as
someone
suggested,
it's
only
one
part
of
a
pair
of
pliers,
the
equality,
in
order
to
make
it
work,
there
must
also
be
protection
against
use
of
the
districting
process
for
impermissible
purposes,
else
equality
serves
no
real
function
of
itself.
and
so,
our
second
argument
is
that
equality
and
compactness
must
be
satisfied
in
reasonable
ways
and,
where
it
is
not
satisfied,
the
state
must
explain.
some
explanations
can
be
given
but,
in
this
case,
there
are
no
satisfactory
explanations
and,
indeed,
there
is
affirmative
evidence
of
a
conscious
intent
to
gerrymander
for
partisan
reasons.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
quite
--
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
quite
clearly
so.
and,
in
this
case,
there
is
an
addition.
the
affirmative
evidence
of
conscious
purpose
for
partisan
or
bipartisan
results
and,
in
addition,
as
mr.
zuckerman
has
just
conceded,
there
was
an
effort
to
secure
a
conservationist
district
which,
seems
to
me,
pervert
the
old
rural-urban
dichotomy
that
was
the
thrust
of
reynolds
versus
sims
originally.
mr.
robert
b.
mckay
that
is
correct,
sir.
