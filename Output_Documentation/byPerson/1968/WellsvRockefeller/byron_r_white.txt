white
what
do
you
think
the
deviation
was
before?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
that
in
the
court
--
was
that
a
court
scene?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
was
only
a
deviation
of
--
total
deviation
or
something
like
that
in
the
stand?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
you
think
it
could
be
available
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
court
at
that
time,
did
it
have
the
figures
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
didn't
have
--
justice
byron
r.
white
have
in
the
district
court
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
made
a
total
deviations
are
like
12%.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
total
deviation
would
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
in
dividing
the
cities
is
permissible
or
not
--
is
it
permissible
to
the
election?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
say
that
really
--
that
suggested
a
--
it's
not
true
in
this
case
because
it
--
at
least
the
inconsistently
invited.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
would
that
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
mean
it'd
be
probably
available
in
1972.
justice
byron
r.
white
clearly
enough
for
seven.
justice
byron
r.
white
agree
with
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it,
the
gerrymander
argument
really
doesn't
depend
on
any
disparities
in
numbers,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
the
districts
could
be
equal
in
population
and
if
the
gerrymander
argument
is
good
here,
it
would
be
good
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
concede
that
the
30
--
that
the
adirondack
area,
the
331st,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
do
you
concede
that
the
--
that
there
was
deliberate
attempt
to
put
the
adirondack
counties
in
one
district?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
--
in
order
to
lump
together
the
so-called
conservationist
interest?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
any
different
with
deliberately
putting
in
the
31st
district
either
all
democrats
or
all
republicans?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
that
the
35th
was
a
deliberate
attempt
to
lump
together
all
rural
interests?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
say
it's
perfectly
testifiable
to
--
deliberately
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
put
together
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
there's
no
--
no,
not
at
all,
but
it
was
done
to
put
together
all
the
people
of
one
interest
or
one
persuasion.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
you
suggest
that
it
is
justified,
that
it's
wholly
proper
for
the
legislature,
that
it's
not
questionable
constitutionally
for
the
legislature
to
draw
the
district
lines
based
upon
the
character
of
the
interest
groups
who
are
defined
by
the
districting?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
that,
do
you
say
it
may
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
in
the
31st,
the
legislature
could
say
“well,
we're
going
to
put
all
the
conservation
interests
together,
that
the
straight
giving
them
representative
and
the
35th
were
going
to
give
the
rural
interest
of
that
who
were
in
that
counties
represented
it,
and
then,
down
in
the
city,
we're
going
to
draw
a
district
so
that
the
negros
have
representative
and
other
women
which
are
catholics
will
have
a
representative.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
to
win
the
--
do
you
have
to
be
right
in
what
you
just
said
to

justice
byron

if
you
win
this

justice
byron

white
gerrymandering?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
apparently,
they
haven't
seized
on
the
stone
theory
about
your
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
about
the
31st
district.
well,
that's
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
was.
there
was
a
motion
for
reconsideration
in
the
district
court
which
brought
the
other
figures
to
the
district
court's
attention,
and
the
figures
were
discussed
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
in
response
here
to
some
extent.
now,
could
you
i
ask
you,
you
would
make
the
same
argument
on
gerrymander
here
whether
there
was
any
population
disparity
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
it
also
your
claim
here
thought
that
the
population
disparities
themselves
are

energized
by
a
gerrymandering
motive?
