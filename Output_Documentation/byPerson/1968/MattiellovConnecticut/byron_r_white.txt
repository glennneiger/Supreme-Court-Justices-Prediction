i
didn't
know
there
was
a
comfortable
time
to
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
cases
of
course
as
death
with
situation
wherein
the
boys
and
girls
can
be
convicted
with
same
thing.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
so
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
get
something
proper
than
that
that
you
can
figure
(inaudible).
justice
byron

white
--
to
be
raised
the
rational
of
these
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
concurs
in
the
books
that
direct
(inaudible)
cases
cited
the
--
or
they
not
be
in
prison
in
two
years?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
have
comfortable
term
in
the
same
time
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
vise
lascivious
may
--
to
either
go
on,
could
even
imagine
a
situation
that
would
be
covered
by
this
provision
i
guess
vise
or
a
vicious
life?
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn't
the
rational
of
the
connecticut
cases
have
set
the
--
inspite
of
the
three-year
provision
that
a
women
could
only
be
held
for
two
years,
wasn't
the
rational
equal
protection?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
since
men
convicted
for
the
same
crime
could
only
be
held
two
years
--
is
it
illegal
to
hold
the
woman
three?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
argument
is
that
there
is
no
comparable
crime
here
for
the
man?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
the
claim
is
that
under
the
connecticut
law
no
matter
what
the
statute
says,
the
woman
can
only
be
held
two
years.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
this
direct
appeal?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
they're
saying
that
under
the
applicable
connecticut
law
as
revealed
in
these
cases,
this
sentence
on
the
lascivious
carriage
charges
not
three
years,
it's
only
two
because
the
connecticut
courts
have
construed
sentences
like
this
to
be
only
two
years
because
of
the
equal
protection
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
could
certainly
make
the
claim
that
he
can
certainly
make
the
claim
here
which
she
has
that
this
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
--
all
you're
saying
is
that
the
cases
at
the
petitioner
relies
on
just
didn't
have
to
be
decided
under
this
particular
section?
justice
byron

why

well,
isn't
this
