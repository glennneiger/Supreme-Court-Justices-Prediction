can
you
think
of
anything
that
almost
anyone
who
can
be
with
the
vise?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
a
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
that's
the
exact
to
see
vague?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what's
your
independent
state
ground
that
no
appeal
was
ever
taken
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
from
the
conviction,
is
that
it,
and
the
conviction
on
lascivious
carriage?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
with
no
appeal
was
ever
taken
when
the
connecticut
appellate
court
come
back
conviction,
is
that
your
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
you
mean
by
independent
state
ground.
i
thought
i
heard
you
say
that
no
appeal
was
ever
taken
to
any
connecticut
appellate
court
from
the
conviction
for
lascivious
carriage,
would
you
say
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
and
therefore,
i
gather
your
point
is
that
whatever
maybe
the
case
as
to
two
years
and
three
years,
this
petitioner
at
least,
appellant
whatever,
is
concluded
by
the
failure
to
appeal
by
the
three-year
sentence
that
was
given,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
say
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
i
understand
you
now
what
you
have
been
saying
is
that
there's
never
been
an
appeal
from
the
conviction
for
lascivious
carriage
which
carried
with
it
the
three-year
sentence,
if
it's
properly
called
a
sentence.
that's
what
you're
saying,
isn't
it?
and
therefore,
there
can't
be
any
issue
as
to
that
sentence
before
this
court
since
it
had
never
been
brought
before
any
connecticut
appellate
court,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
you
said
the
court
of
appeals
i
gather
that
--
connecticut
nevertheless
--
the
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
involve
or
was
not
part
as
a
practice
of
argument.
the
trial
record
before
gone
the
appeal
the
overruling
of
the
demur,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
why
would
he
not,
when
he
able
also
to
do
what
your
advice
of?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
have
a
course
of
conduct?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
on
apparent
sentence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
think
of
anything
that

who
can
