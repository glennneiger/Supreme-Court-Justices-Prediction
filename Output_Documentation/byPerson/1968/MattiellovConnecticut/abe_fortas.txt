justice
abe
fortas
the
only
record
that
we
have
here
does
not
include
the
transcript
to
what
went
on
that
trial,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
why
is
that?
justice
abe
fortas
but
you
plea
--
she
pleaded
not
guilty
to
the
two
counts,
uhm?
justice
abe
fortas
to
all
three
counts
and
then
without
a
trial,
she
was
--
the
court
found
her
guilty?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
happened
at
the
trial?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
why
--
is
there
a
transcript
on
that?
justice
abe
fortas
you
did
not
file
that
in
this
court?
justice
abe
fortas
you
--
there's
a
transcript
where
was
not
filed
even
in
appellate
division
on
this
court?
justice
abe
fortas
so,
we
really
don't
know
what
happened
here
or
what
the
facts
are
--
and
you
say
that
we
are
to
consider
this
as
a
facially
unconstitutional
even
that
--
and
that
we
may
do
that
avoid
from
any
reference
to
the
facts.
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
for
a
quick
moment.
may
i
ask
you
of
the
question
try
to
clarify
the
underlying
sentence
situation
in
my
mind?
if
a
woman
age
22
were
arrested
and
convicted
of
the
crime
of
lascivious
carriage
under
your
statute,
what
would
be
her
sentence?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
what
happen
here
is
that
this
moment
being
under
21,
16
or
17
was
convicted
of
that
same
crime
of
lascivious
carriage,
and
your
position
is
that
the
effective
sentence
was
three
years
because
of
the
order
committing
her
to
the
state
farm
for
women,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
but
so
far
as
the
conviction
of
the
crime
of
lascivious
carriage
is
concern,
the
sentence
provided
by
section
53
whenever
it
is,
is
six
months,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
three-year
hypothesis
depends
solely
upon
what
is
it,
section
17-360?
justice
abe
fortas
and
section
17-360
makes
no
reference
to
the
crime
of
lascivious
carriage,
but
provides
only
as
i
understand
it
that
the
maximum
commitment
to
the
state
farm
for
women
shall
be
three
years,
is
that
right?
are
you
relying
on
the
provision
in
17-360
that
says
that
the
maximum
commitment
to
the
state
farm
for
women
shall
be
three
years?
justice
abe
fortas
please
tell
me
what
part
of
it.
justice
abe
fortas
but
not
lascivious
carriage?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
the
listing
is
not
exclusive?
justice
abe
fortas
all
right,
go
ahead.
i'm
sorry.
read
--
i
mean
say
read
the
rest
of
that
will
you
please?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
all
right
now,
tell
me
in
summary
if
you
don't
mind
just
how
--
just
on
what
theory
keeping
those
statutory
sections
in
mind
you
contend
that
appellant
here
is
serving
a
three-year
sentence
as
a
result
of
her
conviction
of
the
crime
of
lascivious
carriage?
justice
abe
fortas
17-360
says
she
has
to
stay
there
for
three
years?
justice
abe
fortas
this
is
an
extraordinary
chinese
puzzle
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
we
have
before
us
as
i
understand
the
two
problems.
let's
see
if
i
get
this
correct.
first,
is
this
chinese
puzzle
of
that
--
of
extrapolating
the
six
months
sentence
for
lascivious
carriage
in
to
a
three
months
commitment
to
the
state
farm
for
women,
if
its
three
months
and
we
regard
that
as
a
sentence
and
you
get
an
exact
identity
with
the
length
of
the
sentence
under
the
danger
resulting
from
being
a
female
statute.
and
if
that
is
so,
then
we
have
the
problem
of
concurrent
sentences
because
of
lascivious
carriage
conviction
is
not
before
us.
then,
if
we
can
consider
the
raise
up
solacritor
criminal
statute,
the
danger
of
being
a
woman
in
newhaven
of
connecticut,
then
i
suppose
that
--
then
we
get
into
the
questions
that
mr.
justice
black
was
raising.
is
that
a
correct
analysis
of
it?
justice
abe
fortas
what's
a
juvenile
statute
--
what's
the
upper
limit
on
the
age
for
juvenile
court
proceedings
in
connecticut?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
--
but
would
this
young
woman
had
been
--
would
the
juvenile
court
of
the
naval
day
excise
jurisdiction
over
this
young
woman?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
court
could
have
refer
her
and
then
she
could've
been
taking
care
of
under
the
juvenile
court
statute
until
she
was
21?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
sort
of
people
are
caught
up
under
this
statute
then
if
they
are
not
prostitutes?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
most
jurisdictions,
those
are
handled
by
--
under
the
juvenile
court
procedures?
justice
abe
fortas
but
here,
they
--
is
it
customary
or
unusual
for
the
adult
courts
to
refer
cases
like
this
under
the
age
of
18
or
whatever
it
is
to
the
juvenile
court?
justice
abe
fortas
the
only
record
that
we
have
here
does
not
include
the
transcript
to
what
went
on
that
trial,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
why
is
that?
justice
abe

but

justice
abe
fortas

what
happened
at
the
trial?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
why
--
is
there
a
transcript
on
that?
justice
abe
fortas
you
did
not
file
that
in
this
court?
justice
abe
fortas
you
--
there's
a
transcript
where
was
not
filed
even
in
appellate

on

justice
abe
fortas
so,
