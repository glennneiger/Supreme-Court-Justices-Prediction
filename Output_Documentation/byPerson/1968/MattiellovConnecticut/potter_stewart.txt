stewart
on
parole?
justice
potter
stewart
a
female
of
any
age
can
be
convicted
of
lascivious
carriage
i
think?
justice
potter
stewart
but
manifest
danger
is
only
between
16
and
21
and
unmarried?
justice
potter
stewart
have
there
been
any
connecticut
decisions
construing
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you're
relying
squarely
on
your
demur
--
justice
potter
stewart
as
you
did
in
the
connecticut
appellate
courts?
justice
potter
stewart
why
is
that
do
have
any
importance
to
that
--
is
that
bear
on
whether
or
not
these
are
concurrent
sentences?
justice

yes.

justice
potter
stewart
in
june
of
1969?
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
falling
into
danger?
justice
potter
stewart
and
she
is
already
free,
do
you
agree
with
counsel
that
she
is
already
free
under
the
lascivious
carriage?
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
you're
saying
more
than
that,
aren't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
two
or
three
things
more
than
that?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
do
claim
she's
on
parole
on
a
concurrent
sentence
which
has
not
in
no
way
been
attack.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
you
have
in
connecticut
specific
criminal
statutes
and
ordinances
making
illegal
that
sort
of
criminal
conduct
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
sort
hard
core
conduct
that
everybody
seems
to
be
agreed
here
is
covered
by
this
is
also
covered
by
specific
criminal
statutes,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
what
about
parole
to
the
sole
case,
i
notice
that
the
opinion
of
your
appellate
division
sets
up
and
i'm
reading
--
i'm
looking
now
at
pages
14
and
15
of
the
brown
appendix;
sets
out
the
rules
of
the
sole
case
at
some
length,
and
says
on
page
15
the
rule
stated
in
the
sole
case
with
i
think
it
is
precision
and
particularity
were
ignored
by
the
appellant
in
case
before
us,
then
goes
on
to
say
but
we
do
not
rest
our
decision
on
that
ground
alone
which
would
imply
to
me
that
the
decision
is
rested
alternatively
on
that
ground
and
that
would
be
inadequate
state
ground,
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
that's
a
matter
of
connecticut
law
whether
or
not
was
an
error,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
a
matter
for
us?
justice
potter
stewart
appendix
b
of
the
appellee's
brief
seems
to
set
out
the
legislative
history
behind
the
creation
of
this
institution,
is
it
that
1917?
justice
potter
stewart
as
a

and
