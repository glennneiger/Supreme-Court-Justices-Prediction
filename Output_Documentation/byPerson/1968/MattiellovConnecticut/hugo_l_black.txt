justice
hugo
l.
black
how
is
that
work
by
look
to
the
connecticut
statute
and
found
some
difficulty?
well,
i
--
as
far
as
the
city
is
carriage
charge,
they
maximum
term
that
she
could
get
is
two
years
(inaudible)
arise
under
the
manifest
danger
although
never
the
statute,
she
got
a
free
of
sentence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
how
they
concur
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
old
is
the
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
old
is
the
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
the
charge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
the
charge
granted
in
the
record
indictment
or
the
information
or
whatever
it
is?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
do
you
read
this
as
making
it
the
crime
for
girl
to
be
at
manifest
danger
or
contract
to
the
habits
of
vise?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
how
do
you
prove
that
by
the
environment
or
context?
the
fact
that
she's
living
in
the
city
where
there
are
lot
of
temptation
or
how
could
it
be
proved,
that's
all?
that's
just
the
possibility
of
what
mayhem
somebody
in
the
future.
justice
hugo
l.
black
she
contain,
you
convict
her
being
in
danger?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
would
it
be
clear
that's
not
what
the
statute
say.
justice
hugo
l.
black
manifest
danger?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
the
court
ever
construed
it
of
being
a
crime
to
be
in
manifest
danger
to
your
supreme
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
it
ever
construed
it
at
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
have
been
in
the
case
to
sustain?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it's
the
only
case
it's
ever
been
in
state
since
its
title
of
95?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
you
know
there's
been
a
conviction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
this
is
not
for
conduct,
this
is
of
being
in
danger.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
charge
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
we
have
to
consider
it
on
the
basis
of
whether
that's
a
good
statute
can
do
on
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
convict
somebody
of
a
crime
--
do
you
call
it
a
crime
to
be
in
danger?
justice
hugo
l.
black
criminal
is
a
crime
then
you
placed
somewhere
where
you
are
in
danger,
do
you
kept
it
to
do
something
wrong?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
don't
fix
in
the
punishment
like
penalty
or
fine
or
imprisonment,
they
just
put
them
in
jail
like
put
a
child
--
the
parent
will
put
it
in
the
back
room.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
or
finally
take
care
and
see
that
she'd
not
have
any
danger
--
being
in
a
danger
there
after.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know.
it
seems
to
me
like
it's
not
a
crime
they
way
they
handle
that
part,
put
her
in
jail
just
to
take
care
of
that
and
get
out
of
danger.
of
course,
you
might
not
be
completely
out
of
danger
to
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
why
do
we
have
to
pass
on
it
is
she's
out
of
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
agree
that
she's
on
parole?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then,
it's
not
a
moot
of
course.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
know
whether
there
have
been
any
convictions
to
charge
with
danger
of
becoming
a
cigarette
smoker?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mentioned
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
form
of
vise.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
presume
a
lot
of
people
could
agree
with
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
being
a
form
of
vise
from
which
a
person
should
be
protected.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
i
won't
getting
it
is
why
quite
certain
cigarettes
smoking
--
we
consider
the
vise
under
here
for
which
the
person
will
be
sentence
when
danger
becoming
a
cigarette
smoker?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
it
been
in
the
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
--
pass
--
how
about
this
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
which
other
words
in
the
statute
say
that
couldn't
be
--
vise.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
see
why
it
couldn't.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
a
separate
thought.
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
who
has
committed
any
crime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
the
first
time
of
course
is
being
subjected
to
temptation
of
falling
in
the
vise
such
as
cigarette
smoking.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
word
“vise”
is
not
limited
criminal
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
will
be
bad
to
be
charge
of
being
attempted
that
way,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
a
matter
of
fact,
you
realize
or
into
the
vise
of
having
a
definite
meaning.
it
doesn't
have
any
boundaries
then
going
what
people
think.
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
you
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
couldn't
they
write
one
that's
limited
to
that?
why
should
to
be
trying
people,
trying
--
danger
falling
into
vise
and
it
covers
of
thousand
different
things
to
a
thousand
different
people?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
don't
know.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
the
sky
is
the
limit
under
this
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
could
we
do
that
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
we
have
to
get
to
it.
they
here
challenging
on
our
grounds
in
vague.
justice
hugo
l.
black
unconstitutional
vague
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
independent
state
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
mean
there's
another
--
that's
the
one
you
were
talking
to
justice
fortas?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
pretty
long
way
in
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
it's
called
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
carriage?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
it
against
the
law,
is
it
a
crime
to
have
a
lascivious
carriage?
justice
hugo
l.
black
excuse
me,
pardon
me?
justice

l.
black
demeanor,
walking
for
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
a
conduct.
justice
hugo
l.

of
course,
there's
somebody
want
lascivious?
it's
not
for
that
the
balance
of
reasoning
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
many
of
them
subject
to

by
them
--
justice

black
well,
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
justice

black
how

justice

in

is
this
