mr.
robert
n.
grosby
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
appellant
in
this
case
was
arrested
in
march
of
1966
and
charged
with
violation
of
section
17-379
connecticut
general
statutes
--
statute
causing
the
arrest
and
imprisonment
of
someone
who
is
in
manifest
danger
of
falling
into
vise
or
is
living
a
vicious
life.
the
appellant
file
a
demur
to
this
information
on
two
grounds.
one
was
that
its
terms
are
vague
and
uncertain
in
meaning,
thereby
depriving
here
of
due
process;
the
second
ground
for
demur
was
that
the
statute
discriminates
against
certain
females;
that
is
unmarried
females
between
the
ages
of
18
and
21
without
basis
for
its
support
and
thereby
denying
equal
protection.
on
the
same
day,
the
demur
was
filed,
the
state
of
connecticut
filed
a
substitute
information
alleging
two
additional
charges.
one
was
violation
of
section
53-219
of
the
general
statutes
that
statute
entitled
“lascivious
carriage
and
fornication”,
and
section
53-175
of
the
statutes
which
is
the
disorderly
conduct
statute,
the
demur
was
overruled,
the
plaintiff
pleaded
not
guilty
to
all
charges
elected
a
trial
to
the
court
was
found
guilty
of
17-379,
guilty
of
53-219,
and
not
guilty
of
disorderly
conduct.
and
her
sentence
was
commitment
to
the
study
--
the
connecticut
state
farm
for
women.
i
think
all
parties
agree
that
these
sentences
were
concurrent
under
applicable
connecticut
law.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
that's
right
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
except
this
way
that
at
the
time
of
sentencing,
the
applicable
law
was
that
the
sentence
on
lascivious
carriage
could
also
be
for
three
years
to
the
reformatory.
recent
developments
particularly
the
cases
we
cited
in
our
reply
brief,
two
federal
district
court
cases
and
two
connecticut
superior
court
cases
have
held
that
by
compelling
a
three-year
sentence
on
lascivious
carriage,
that
say
discrimination
against
the
female
because
boys
can
only
be
convicted
for
two
years
under
the
applicable
statute
for
boys.
so,
that
--
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
and
--
well,
not
with
respect
to
17-379.
17-379
your
honor
deals
only
with
manifest
danger.
now,
17-360
says
that
a
female
over
the
age
of
16
who
has
been
convicted
of
a
misdemeanor
and
lascivious
carriage
as
a
misdemeanor
can
go
to
the
connecticut
state
farm
for
three
years.
17-390
says
that
a
young
boy
who
is
convicted
of
a
misdemeanor
can
go
to
the
reformatory
for
two
years.
therefore,
subsequent
cases
--
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
with
respect
--
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
a
man
could
be
convicted
of
fornication
or
breach
of
the
peach
or
disorderly
conduct
and
be
sentence
to
two
years
to
reformatory.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
yes,
sir.
so,
two
district
courts
held
in
southern
connecticut
superior
court.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
yes,
sir.
the
young
boy
convicted
of
lascivious
carriage
or
fornication
could
be
sentence
to
two
years
at
the
reformatory
while
a
young
girl
convicted
of
the
same
statute
could
be
sentence
to
three,
and
these
cases
in
our
reply
brief
said,
this
is
improper
and
that
two
is
the
maximum
sentence
for
girls
as
well
as
boys.
so,
that
it
appears
that
the
sentences
were
no
longer
concurrent
when
this
new
law
was
developed.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
yes,
sir.
we
take
the
position
that
two
years
have
expired
and
that
if
the
maximum
sentence
on
lascivious
carriage
which
is
two
years
has
expired
and
the
only
thing
that's
holding
her
now
is
her
conviction
on
manifest
danger
and
therefore,
we
take
the
position
that
if
you
reverse
that
conviction,
she'll
be
set
at
liberty.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
she's
on
parole.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
ah,
the
lascivious
carriage
commitment
statute
as
supplied
by
recent
decision
as
two
years.
the
manifest
danger
statute
says
until
age
21.
we
do
have
interpretations
and
they're
in
the
record
that
three
years
is
the
maximum
on
either.
so,
that
she
is
liable
for
the
lascivious
carriage
statute
until
june
9,
1969
and
the
lascivious
carriage
conviction
is
maximum
sentence
we
feel
has
expired
on
june
9,
1968.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
a
commitment
on
manifest
danger
is
until
she's
21
or
three
years
which
ever
occurs
first.
a
commitment
on
lascivious
carriage
statute
is
three
years
but
the
court
say
two
years.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
the
courts
have
interpreted
to
mean
two
years.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
because
it's
a
discrimination
between
boys
and
girls.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
yes,
sir.
oh,
i
think
the
court
anticipated
the
jurisdictional
question
when
you
raise
the
four
questions
that
you
asked
us
to
answer
in
connection
with
our
further
jurisdictional
statement
and
to
clarify
this
once
again.
we
take
the
position
that
the
sentences
are
separate
sentences
that
she's
serving
her
sentence
under
lascivious
carriage
and
manifest
danger
at
the
sentences
at
once
initially
were
concurrent
that
her
maximum
sentence
on
lascivious
carriage
has
expired
and
that
she
is
only
on
parole
on
a
conviction
on
manifest
danger.
our
brief
on
the
merits
that
makes
three
points;
the
first
one
was
whether
manifest
danger
statute
is
a
penal
statute
and
we
cover
that
because
the
appellate
division
of
the
circuit
court
in
its
memorandum
decided
that
that
is
not
a
penal
statute,
it's
a
remedial
statute,
and
therefore
it
was
not
necessary
for
them
to
take
up
the
constitutional
questions.
we
claim
that
this
is
a
statute
that
provides
for
the
deprivation
of
liberty
and
therefore
the
due
process
provisions
of
the
constitution
must
apply
whether
connecticut
chooses
to
call
as
remedial
or
penal.
our
second
point
is
that
the
terms
have
vise
and
vicious
life
rendered
that
manifest
danger
statute
avoid
for
vagueness
because
they
fail
to
avoid
the
accused.
they
steer
clear
standard
of
conduct.
now,
we
claim
that
this
statute
is
so
vague
that
an
unmarried
female
of
common
intelligence
must
necessarily
guess
at
its
meaning,
and
we
claim
that
the
trier
of
fact
has
no
standard
by
which
the
judge
a
case
and
there's
no
standard
by
which
to
charge
the
jury.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
no,
sir,
i
have
not.
i
listen
to
the
argument
yesterday
of
the
construing
by
the
illinois
supreme
court
of
that
statute
but
we
have
none.
there
has
been
no
adjudication
and
there's
no
way
that
any
of
our
courts
have
ever
set
forth
a
definition
of
manifest
danger
falling
at
the
vise
or
vicious
life.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
i
suppose
i
could
your
honor.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
well,
--
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
well,
we
feel
that
--
and
you
said
so
in
pitrello
that
the
statute
is
so
vague
that
no
recourse
need
be
made
to
facts
that
this
is
unconstitutionality
in
toto
on
its
face
rather
than
an
application,
and
we
feel
that
this
is
a
pitrello.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
i
do
sir.
i
may
have
some
personal
precollection
as
to
what
is
vise
or
vagueness
and
i'm
sure
a
trial
judge
would
too.
but
until
there's
a
definite
definition
by
a
statute
or
perhaps
a
construction
by
of
court,
i
think
its
void
on
its
face
and
this
is
the
position
that
be
raise
squarely
by
our
demur.
and
this
is
why
we
presented
no
facts
to
the
appellate
division.
the
third
point
in
our
brief
is
that
the
manifest
danger
statute
applies
only
to
men
--
only
to
girls
and
not
to
men.
a
young
man
cannot
be
convicted
of
his
habits
of
falling
into
vise
or
vicious
life.
he
must
first
be
convicted
of
a
substantive
crime
and
the
same
with
married
women
in
order
to
be
--
convicted
a
married
woman
must
first
be
convicted
of
a
substantive
crime
before
she
could
be
sent
to
the
reformatory.
we
submit
that
female
vises
are
no
more
dangerous
than
male
vises
and
we
see
and
confine
no
substantial
or
natural
difference
germane
to
the
subject,
which
justify
a
sexual
differentiation.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
sir?
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
the
statute
is
1917.
i
think
the
legislative
history
has
set
forth
in
the
states'
brief
as
an
appendix.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
that's
right
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
but
we
took
the
position
mr.
justice
that
the
statute
is
so
patently
vague
on
its
face
that
a
recourse
to
the
facts
would
avail
nothing
that
this
is
unconstitutionality
in
toto
and
not
an
application.
and
that
an
examination
of
the
facts
would
serve
no
use
of
purpose
and
this
was
the
issue
squarely
raised
by
the
demur.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
not
guilty
to
all
three
counts.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
no,
sir.
she
had
a
trial.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
testimony
was
taken.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
there
is
a
transcript
sir,
but
we
didn't
--
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
nor
that
we
file
it
but
appellate
division.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
i
take
that
position
sir.
this
court
did
it
in
pitrello
--
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
we
do
have
a
procedure
in
our
state
whereby
the
appellee
has
the
right
to
present
evidence
to
the
appellate
court
so
that
the
state
did
have
enough
opportunity
in
this
case
to
present
the
record
of
the
transcript
to
the
appellate
court
have
they
chose,
in
which
case
would
be
before
you.
mr.
carroll
also
said
that
the
sole
case
requires
evidence.
we
take
issue
with
that.
we
claim
that
the
sole
case
has
decided
by
our
supreme
court
was
a
constitutionality
case
with
respect
to
application
and
not
in
toto
as
we
claim
here.
mr.
justice
black
indicated
whether
there
were
any
decisions
under
this
or
any
cases
under
this
statute
and
in
our
appendix,
we
indicate
that
between
eight
years
of
1961
to
19
--
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
appendix
to
our
brief.
there's
only
one
appendix
page
21.
we
indicate
that
there
are
560
cases
since
1961.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
560.
148
of
which
were
committed
to
the
connecticut
state
farm.
256
guilty
findings
179
null
in
pros,
54
not
guilties
and
some
referral
to
the
juvenile
court
and
some
bind
over
this
to
the
superior
court.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
no,
sir.
the
--
we
say
that
the
appellate
division
opinion
was
in
error
subsequent
to
the
mattiello
case
--
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
that's
right.
mr.
justice,
there's
one
other
item
i'd
like
to
take
up
and
that
is
the
question
of
independent
state
ground.
we
were
bound
--
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
it's
for
women
of
all
ages.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
but
there
is
segregation.
in
other
words,
a
woman
convicted
on
manifest
danger
falling
into
vise
would
be
separated
from
other
felons
or
misdemeanors
who
were
sentenced
to
that
--
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
i
think
not.
i
think
that
on
prostitution
cases,
they
used
the
prostitution
statute.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
yes,
sir.
the
independent
state
grounds
--
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
young
girls
who
have
been
found
in
parked
cars
with
the
young
men,
young
girls
who
run
away
from
home,
those
are
the
situations
i
dealt
with,
i've
had
about
four
of
them
and
mr.
harbro
has
had
about
four
or
five
of
them;
one
presently
on
appeal
before
the
connecticut
supreme
court.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
that's
true
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
i
think
they
we've
shown
in
our
appendix
that
only
47
of
the
560
or
8.4%
are
referred
juvenile
court
in
the
period
from
1961
to
1967.
we
were
bound
by
the
connecticut
law
and
the
cases
which
are
not
in
our
brief
of
lyford
versus
torkington,
115
connecticut
600,
renick
versus
wakka,
4
connecticut's
superior
at
259,
and
4
connecticut's
superior
436
in
vina
versus
wakka,
17
connecticut
supplement
365
from
attacking
the
lascivious
danger
statute.
this
is
the
independent
state
grounds
of
problem
and
we
felt
that
the
first
time
that
we
could've
don't
this
was
when
your
decision
was
announced
in
payton
versus
roe,
although
payton
versus
roe
does
not
appear
to
be
a
concurrent
situation,
and
yet
it
might
be
that
the
payton
versus
roe
doctrine
quite
supersedes
someday.
the
case
is
suggested
as
still
being
the
lower
and
mr.
carroll's
brief
on
page
6
that
is
the
hirohashi
and
the
pinkerton
matters
for
several
reasons.
assuming
for
a
moment
which
we
don't
concede
that
the
lascivious
danger
situation
is
still
three
years,
we
claim
it's
two.
but
assuming
that
it's
three,
we
think
there's
a
compelling
reason
to
consider
an
appeal
or
habeas
corpus
on
one
concurrent
sentence.
this
might
have
to
do
with
period
of
probation,
the
period
of
parole,
it
might
have
to
do
in
getting
a
job
even
if
this
girl
have
to
serve
three
years
in
lascivious
carriage.
if
she
was
convicted
of
manifest
danger
of
falling
into
vise,
this
could
have
some
effect
on
her
future
job
holding
ability
or
an
effort
to
get
a
job.
and
i
think
perhaps
your
payton
versus
roe
case
is
one
that
may
we
reopen
this
whole
situation
on
independent
state
ground.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
yes,
sir.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
appellant
in
this
case
was
arrested
in
march
of
1966
and
charged
with
violation
of
section
17-379
connecticut
general
statutes
--
statute
causing
the
arrest
and
imprisonment
of
someone
who
is
in
manifest
danger
of
falling
into
vise
or
is
living
a
vicious
life.
the
appellant
file
a
demur
to
this
information
on
two
grounds.
one
was
that
its
terms
are
vague
and
uncertain
in
meaning,
thereby
depriving
here
of
due
process;
the
second
ground
for
demur
was
that
the
statute
discriminates
against
certain
females;
that
is
unmarried
females
between
the
ages
of
18
and
21
without
basis
for
its
support
and
thereby
denying
equal
protection.
on
the
same
day,
the
demur
was
filed,
the
state
of
connecticut
filed
a
substitute
information
alleging
two
additional
charges.
one
was
violation
of
section
53-219
of
the
general
statutes
that
statute
entitled
“lascivious
carriage
and
fornication”,
and
section
53-175
of
the
statutes
which
is
the
disorderly
conduct
statute,
the
demur
was
overruled,
the
plaintiff
pleaded
not
guilty
to
all
charges
elected
a
trial
to
the
court
was
found
guilty
of
17-379,
guilty
of
53-219,
and
not
guilty
of
disorderly
conduct.
and
her
sentence
was
commitment
to
the
study
--
the
connecticut
state
farm
for
women.
i
think
all
parties
agree
that
these
sentences
were
concurrent
under
applicable
connecticut
law.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
that's
right
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
except
this
way
that
at
the
time
of
sentencing,
the
applicable
law
was
that
the
sentence
on
lascivious
carriage
could
also
be
for
three
years
to
the
reformatory.
recent
developments
particularly
the
cases
we
cited
in
our
reply
brief,
two
federal
district
court
cases
and
two
connecticut
superior
court
cases
have
held
that
by
compelling
a
three-year
sentence
on
lascivious
carriage,
that
say
discrimination
against
the
female
because
boys
can
only
be
convicted
for
two
years
under
the
applicable
statute
for
boys.
so,
that
--
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
and
--
well,
not
with
respect
to
17-379.
17-379
your
honor
deals
only
with
manifest
danger.
now,
17-360
says
that
a
female
over
the
age
of
16
who
has
been
convicted
of
a
misdemeanor
and
lascivious
carriage
as
a
misdemeanor
can
go
to
the
connecticut
state
farm
for
three
years.
17-390
says
that
a
young
boy
who
is
convicted
of
a
misdemeanor
can
go
to
the
reformatory
for
two
years.
therefore,
subsequent
cases
--
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
with
respect
--
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
a
man
could
be
convicted
of
fornication
or
breach
of
the
peach
or
disorderly
conduct
and
be
sentence
to
two
years
to
reformatory.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
yes,
sir.
so,
two
district
courts
held
in
southern
connecticut
superior
court.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
yes,
sir.
the
young
boy
convicted
of
lascivious
carriage
or
fornication
could
be
sentence
to
two
years
at
the
reformatory
while
a
young
girl
convicted
of
the
same
statute
could
be
sentence
to
three,
and
these
cases
in
our
reply
brief
said,
this
is
improper
and
that
two
is
the
maximum
sentence
for
girls
as
well
as
boys.
so,
that
it
appears
that
the
sentences
were
no
longer
concurrent
when
this
new
law
was
developed.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
yes,
sir.
we
take
the
position
that
two
years
have
expired
and
that
if
the
maximum
sentence
on
lascivious
carriage
which
is
two
years
has
expired
and
the
only
thing
that's
holding
her
now
is
her
conviction
on
manifest
danger
and
therefore,
we
take
the
position
that
if
you
reverse
that
conviction,
she'll
be
set
at
liberty.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
she's
on
parole.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
ah,
the
lascivious
carriage
commitment
statute
as
supplied
by
recent
decision
as
two
years.
the
manifest
danger
statute
says
until
age
21.
we
do
have
interpretations
and
they're
in
the
record
that
three
years
is
the
maximum
on
either.
so,
that
she
is
liable
for
the
lascivious
carriage
statute
until
june
9,
1969
and
the
lascivious
carriage
conviction
is
maximum
sentence
we
feel
has
expired
on
june
9,
1968.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
a
commitment
on
manifest
danger
is
until
she's
21
or
three
years
which
ever
occurs
first.
a
commitment
on
lascivious
carriage
statute
is
three
years
but
the
court
say
two
years.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
the
courts
have
interpreted
to
mean
two
years.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
because
it's
a
discrimination
between
boys
and
girls.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
yes,
sir.
oh,
i
think
the
court
anticipated
the
jurisdictional
question
when
you
raise
the
four
questions
that
you
asked
us
to
answer
in
connection
with
our
further
jurisdictional
statement
and
to
clarify
this
once
again.
we
take
the
position
that
the
sentences
are
separate
sentences
that
she's
serving
her
sentence
under
lascivious
carriage
and
manifest
danger
at
the
sentences
at
once
initially
were
concurrent
that
her
maximum
sentence
on
lascivious
carriage
has
expired
and
that
she
is
only
on
parole
on
a
conviction
on
manifest
danger.
our
brief
on
the
merits
that
makes
three
points;
the
first
one
was
whether
manifest
danger
statute
is
a
penal
statute
and
we
cover
that
because
the
appellate
division
of
the
circuit
court
in
its
memorandum
decided
that
that
is
not
a
penal
statute,
it's
a
remedial
statute,
and
therefore
it
was
not
necessary
for
them
to
take
up
the
constitutional
questions.
we
claim
that
this
is
a
statute
that
provides
for
the
deprivation
of
liberty
and
therefore
the
due
process
provisions
of
the
constitution
must
apply
whether
connecticut
chooses
to
call
as
remedial
or
penal.
our
second
point
is
that
the
terms
have
vise
and
vicious
life
rendered
that
manifest
danger
statute
avoid
for
vagueness
because
they
fail
to
avoid
the
accused.
they
steer
clear
standard
of
conduct.
now,
we
claim
that
this
statute
is
so
vague
that
an
unmarried
female
of
common
intelligence
must
necessarily
guess
at
its
meaning,
and
we
claim
that
the
trier
of
fact
has
no
standard
by
which
the
judge
a
case
and
there's
no
standard
by
which
to
charge
the
jury.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
no,
sir,
i
have
not.
i
listen
to
the
argument
yesterday
of
the
construing
by
the
illinois
supreme
court
of
that
statute
but
we
have
none.
there
has
been
no
adjudication
and
there's
no
way
that
any
of
our
courts
have
ever
set
forth
a
definition
of
manifest
danger
falling
at
the
vise
or
vicious
life.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
i
suppose
i
could
your
honor.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
well,
--
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
well,
we
feel
that
--
and
you
said
so
in
pitrello
that
the
statute
is
so
vague
that
no
recourse
need
be
made
to
facts
that
this
is
unconstitutionality
in
toto
on
its
face
rather
than
an
application,
and
we
feel
that
this
is
a
pitrello.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
i
do
sir.
i
may
have
some
personal
precollection
as
to
what
is
vise
or
vagueness
and
i'm
sure
a
trial
judge
would
too.
but
until
there's
a
definite
definition
by
a
statute
or
perhaps
a
construction
by
of
court,
i
think
its
void
on
its
face
and
this
is
the
position
that
be
raise
squarely
by
our
demur.
and
this
is
why
we
presented
no
facts
to
the
appellate
division.
the
third
point
in
our
brief
is
that
the
manifest
danger
statute
applies
only
to
men
--
only
to
girls
and
not
to
men.
a
young
man
cannot
be
convicted
of
his
habits
of
falling
into
vise
or
vicious
life.
he
must
first
be
convicted
of
a
substantive
crime
and
the
same
with
married
women
in
order
to
be
--
convicted
a
married
woman
must
first
be
convicted
of
a
substantive
crime
before
she
could
be
sent
to
the
reformatory.
we
submit
that
female
vises
are
no
more
dangerous
than
male
vises
and
we
see
and
confine
no
substantial
or
natural
difference
germane
to
the
subject,
which
justify
a
sexual
differentiation.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
sir?
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
the
statute
is
1917.
i
think
the
legislative
history
has
set
forth
in
the
states'
brief
as
an
appendix.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
that's
right
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
but
we
took
the
position
mr.
justice
that
the
statute
is
so
patently
vague
on
its
face
that
a
recourse
to
the
facts
would
avail
nothing
that
this
is
unconstitutionality
in
toto
and
not
an
application.
and
that
an
examination
of
the
facts
would
serve
no
use
of
purpose
and
this
was
the
issue
squarely
raised
by
the
demur.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
not
guilty
to
all
three
counts.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
no,
sir.
she
had
a
trial.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
testimony
was
taken.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
there
is
a
transcript
sir,
but
we
didn't
--
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
nor
that
we
file
it
but
appellate
division.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
i
take
that
position
sir.
this
court
did
it
in
pitrello
--
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
we
do
have
a
procedure
in
our
state
whereby
the
appellee
has
the
right
to
present
evidence
to
the
appellate
court
so
that
the
state
did
have
enough
opportunity
in
this
case
to
present
the
record
of
the
transcript
to
the
appellate
court
have
they
chose,
in
which
case
would
be
before
you.
mr.
carroll
also
said
that
the
sole
case
requires
evidence.
we
take
issue
with
that.
we
claim
that
the
sole
case
has
decided
by
our
supreme
court
was
a
constitutionality
case
with
respect
to
application
and
not
in
toto
as
we
claim
here.
mr.
justice
black
indicated
whether
there
were
any
decisions
under
this
or
any
cases
under
this
statute
and
in
our
appendix,
we
indicate
that
between
eight
years
of
1961
to
19
--
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
appendix
to
our
brief.
there's
only
one
appendix
page
21.
we
indicate
that
there
are
560
cases
since
1961.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
560.
148
of
which
were
committed
to
the
connecticut
state
farm.
256
guilty
findings
179
null
in
pros,
54
not
guilties
and
some
referral
to
the
juvenile
court
and
some
bind
over
this
to
the
superior
court.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
no,
sir.
the
--
we
say
that
the
appellate
division
opinion
was
in
error
subsequent
to
the
mattiello
case
--
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
that's
right.
mr.
justice,
there's
one
other
item
i'd
like
to
take
up
and
that
is
the
question
of
independent
state
ground.
we
were
bound
--
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
it's
for
women
of
all
ages.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
but
there
is
segregation.
in
other
words,
a
woman
convicted
on
manifest
danger
falling
into
vise
would
be
separated
from
other
felons
or
misdemeanors
who
were
sentenced
to
that
--
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
i
think
not.
i
think
that
on
prostitution
cases,
they
used
the
prostitution
statute.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
yes,
sir.
the
independent
state
grounds
--
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
young
girls
who
have
been
found
in
parked
cars
with
the
young
men,
young
girls
who
run
away
from
home,
those
are
the
situations
i
dealt
with,
i've
had
about
four
of
them
and
mr.
harbro
has
had
about
four
or
five
of
them;
one
presently
on
appeal
before
the
connecticut
supreme
court.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
that's
true
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
i
think
they
we've
shown
in
our
appendix
that
only
47
of
the
560
or
8.4%
are
referred
juvenile
court
in
the
period
from
1961
to
1967.
we
were
bound
by
the
connecticut
law
and
the
cases
which
are
not
in
our
brief
of
lyford
versus
torkington,
115
connecticut
600,
renick
versus
wakka,
4
connecticut's
superior
at
259,
and
4
connecticut's
superior
436
in
vina
versus
wakka,
17
connecticut
supplement
365
from
attacking
the
lascivious
danger
statute.
this
is
the
independent
state
grounds
of
problem
and
we
felt
that
the
first
time
that
we
could've
don't
this
was
when
your
decision
was
announced
in
payton
versus
roe,
although
payton
versus
roe
does
not
appear
to
be
a
concurrent
situation,
and
yet
it
might
be
that
the
payton
versus
roe
doctrine
quite
supersedes
someday.
the
case
is
suggested
as
still
being
the
lower
and
mr.
carroll's
brief
on
page
6
that
is
the
hirohashi
and
the
pinkerton
matters
for
several
reasons.
assuming
for
a
moment
which
we
don't
concede
that
the
lascivious
danger
situation
is
still
three
years,
we
claim
it's
two.
but
assuming
that
it's
three,
we
think
there's
a
compelling
reason
to
consider
an
appeal
or
habeas
corpus
on
one
concurrent
sentence.
this
might
have
to
do
with
period
of
probation,
the
period
of
parole,
it
might
have
to
do
in
getting
a
job
even
if
this
girl
have
to
serve
three
years
in
lascivious
carriage.
if
she
was
convicted
of
manifest
danger
of
falling
into
vise,
this
could
have
some
effect
on
her
future
job
holding
ability
or
an
effort
to
get
a
job.
and
i
think
perhaps
your
payton
versus
roe
case
is
one
that
may
we
reopen
this
whole
situation
on
independent
state
ground.
mr.
robert
n.
grosby
yes,
sir.
thank
you.
