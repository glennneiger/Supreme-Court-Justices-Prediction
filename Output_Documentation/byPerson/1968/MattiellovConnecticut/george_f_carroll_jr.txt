mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
really
no
quarrel
about
the
facts
as
recited
by
mr.
grosby.
the
state
does
however
wants
to
--
i
would
do
respect
correct
two
things
in
those
facts
and
that
is
the
age
of
statute.
53-379
was
originally
passed
in
1905
in
substantially
its
present
form
and
mr.
grosby's
reference
to
the
states
brief
in
terms
of
legislative
history
really
was
in
connection
with
17-360
which
is
the
commitment
vehicle
statute.
so,
that
the
statute
really
goes
back
to
1905,
the
words
“manifest
danger”
falling
in
to
habits
of
vise,
but
that's
when
they
first
appear
as
far
as
i
know
in
our
law.
there
is
another
dispute
or
--
i
don't
think
it's
really
a
dispute
but
it
disparity
in
facts.
this
girl
was
17
when
she
was
convicted
and
as
i
set
forth
in
our
brief,
her
birthday
was
april
15,
1949
and
there's
a
great
deal
of
confusion
even
in
the
record
and
in
the
decision
of
our
appellate
division.
i
believe
they
say
that
she
was
18
but
that
is
incorrect.
she
was
born
1949
convicted
in
june
of
1966.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
does.
no,
it
does
not
that
mr.
justice
but
it
may
have
a
bearing
in
terms
of
the
applicability
of
the
three
year
maximum
provision
for
the
age
21.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
now,
on
section
53-279
which
is
the
statute
--
i'm
sorry,
17-379
which
is
the
statute
that's
under
appeal
here,
17-379
in
which
are
contain
the
words
“manifest
danger
fall
into
vise”
--
habit
to
vise.
it
says
until
she
is
21
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
--
in
any
unmarried
female
between
16
and
21,
she'll
be
committed
there
until
she's
21,
but
section
17-360
which
i
think
we
can
agree
is
the
actual
committing
vehicle.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
limits
it
to
a
maximum
of
three
years.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
so,
you
have
a
certain
dilemma
there
and
in
our
brief
in
appendix
a,
we
set
forth
in
attorney
general's
opinion
in
which
he
said
the
numbers
of
the
statutes
were
different
then,
but
i
don't
think
there's
any
quarrel
about
this.
if
the
girl
becomes
21
first,
then
she
has
to
be
release
or
three
years.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
which
ever
is
earlier
and
i
set
that
forth
in
my
brief
as
an
opinion
but
it's
but
--
just
by
the
attorney
general's
opinion
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
real
quarrel
about
that.
now,
in
terms
--
if
your
question
her
age
would
have
an
effect
on
that.
in
other
words,
if
she's
17
as
i
claim
she
is
and
she
was,
she's
born
1949,
then
her
time
would
be
up
in
three
years
that
when
she
reach
21.
so,
she'd
be
release
in
--
or
she'd
be
free
from
parole
in
june
of
1969.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
under
the
falling
into
danger.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
oh,
no
mr.
justice.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
and
that's
our
main
argument
if
i
may
that
this
conviction
and
sentence
stand
an
independent
state
grounds;
namely
the
conviction
on
lascivious
carriage
charge
under
53-219.
now,
that
is
--
that
statute
was
--
she
received
the
concurrent
sentence
and
the
sentencing
provisions
again
are
under
17-360.
the
same
sentencing
vehicle
or
the
same
sentencing
maximum
sentence,
namely
the
three
years
are
applicable
to
this
girl
and
she
was
discharged
of
which
she
was
convicted
lascivious
carriage
at
the
same
trial
was
not
appealed.
there's
no
appeal
from
that
statute.
there's
no
habeas
corpus
involved
in
it.
and
in
addition
to
mr.
justice
white's
noting
the
fact
that
there
is
no
comparable
statute
for
men
not
only
of
the
sentences
to
different
agree
maximum
sentences
are
different,
but
there's
no
statute
comparable
to
manifest
danger
falling
into
habits
of
vise
for
young
men.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
it
was.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
and
that's
correct
mr.
justice
and
my
argument
is
more
than
that.
it's
also
that
those
decisions
are
not
binding
here
at
all.
this
statute,
53-219,
is
not
before
the
court
at
all
and
that's
why
under
the
line
of
case
is
cited
in
the
brief,
i
claim
that
render
for
threshold
of
this
whole
case,
the
court
is
met
by
a
conviction
without
infirmity
on
another
statute
with
the
concurrent
sentence
because
there's
nothing
here
before
the
court
that
says
that
the
limitation
on
53-219
conviction
is
two
years
as
far
as
--
especially
as
far
as
young
girls
between
16
and
21
are
concerned.
there's
nothing
to
that
effect
before
the
court
when
that
girl
was
sentenced
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
well,
i
claim
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
this
is
a
direct
appeal.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
i
take
issue
with
that
because
of
the
fact
that
the
highest
court
of
connecticut
is
not
said
so
and
the
fact
is
that
the
only
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
he
can
make
the
claim
that
it's
a
denial
of
equal
protection
but
i
can
make
the
claim
that
this
convictions
stands
on
the
independent
state
grounds.
the
highest
court
of
state
of
connecticut
has
not
set
that
there's
any
two-year
limitation
under
section
53-219
in
which
she
was
duly
convicted.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
no
appeal
was
ever
taken
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
and
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
i
don't
understand
the
question.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
i
said
it.
i
say
that
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
that's
right.
there
is
been
no
ruling
administratively
or
otherwise
or
no
decision
of
the
connecticut
supreme
court
then
in
the
case
like
this
with
the
minor
female,
16
--
between
16
and
21
convicted
of
lascivious
carriage
that
the
maximum
sentence
should
be
anything
less
than
three
years.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
and
they
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
well,
i
think
yes
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
i'm
saying
more
than
that.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
from
the
denial
of
the
demur.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
on
53
--
excuse
me.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
it
should've
been
brought
by
appeal
or
by
habeas
corpus
if
they
want
to
attack
that
sentence,
but
the
sentence
standards,
there's
maximum
of
three
years.
there's
no
change
in
that
sentence.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
i
think
that
there
are
at
least,
that
the
word
“vise”
is
at
least
this
clear
in
common
language
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
that's
a
hard
thing
to
answer
mr.
justice
as
a
matter
of
degree.
i
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
i
think
vise
is
prefers
more
clear.
and
if
i
may
just
to
expound
from
that,
a
federal
case
which
didn't
involved
with
criminal
conviction
but
did
say
about
vise
that
nothing
is
--
well,
i'll
paraphrase
it,
nothing
is
more
clear
that
promiscuous
and
uninhibited
sexual
intercourse
is
vise
that
that's
--
if
anything
is
vise,
that's
it.
and
you
see
here
unfortunately,
we
don't
have
the
facts
before
the
court
to
or
the
record
of
the
conduct
of
this
young
woman
to
measure
against
the
words
of
the
statute
because
i
think
this
is
a
type
of
statute
that
in
certain
cases
could
be
applied
in
nonconstitutional
manner.
it
is
not
unconstitutionally
void
for
vagueness
on
its
face
but
that
the
court
should
have
the
benefit
of
the
conduct
to
measure
against
the
words
of
the
statute.
and
after
all,
isn't
that
only
logical
because
the
reasons
for
the
statute
being
void
for
vagueness
and
therefore
denial
of
due
process
are
to,
primarily
that
the
actor
doesn't
know
what
conduct
is
proscribed.
well,
i
say
that
the
record
of
this
case
would
reveal
that
this
actor
or
any
actor
would
know
that
the
conduct
would
come
within
the
purview
of
the
word
“vise”,
but
not
having
that
before
it
is
another
reason.
the
state
maintains
that
the
court
should
not
disturb
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
it
wasn't
made
a
part
of
the
record.
you
mean
the
transcript
your
honor
of
the
evidence?
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
the
court
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
are
not
the
way
the
appeal
was
taken,
no
because
it
was
just
an
appeal
from
the
overruling
of
the
demur.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
oh,
well,
yes
i
do
because
under
our
practice
in
the
case
that
i've
cited
in
my
brief
called
state
versus
sol
is
that
you
cannot
--
the
overrule
by
a
demur
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
then
proceed
to
a
full
trial
and
be
convicted
and
then
appeal
the
overruling
of
the
demur
without
any
evidence
before
the
appellate
court.
that's
our
law
under
the
case
of
state
versus
sol.
i
should
add
as
i
did
in
the
brief
however
that
the
court
said
but
anyhow,
we're
going
to
look
at
the
situation
because
of
the
constitutional
issues
that
were
involved.
but
they
clearly
set
forth
in
the
connecticut
law
and
namely
there
shouldn't
be
here
or
shouldn't
be
in
the
connecticut
appellate
court
in
this
form
because
the
demur,
having
been
overruled,
then
the
trial,
and
then
the
conviction
mr.
defense
counsel
made
a
motion
dismiss
that
on
the
appeal,
the
record
of
that
trial
should
be
before
the
court.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
the
overruling
the
demur.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
i
do
because
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
i
don't
know
if
i
argue
just
in
the
terms
that
chief
justice
means
but
i
argue
with
in
terms
of
the
state
--
this
court
being
unable
to
pass
upon
the
statute
without
having
before
it
the
facts
that
were
brought
out
at
the
trial
and
were
the
basis
of
her
conviction
under
it.
i
haven't
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
it
is
but
i
think
mr.
chief
justice's
point
that
i
have
made
a
procedural
argument
on
that.
i
made
--
i've
tried
to
make
a
substantive
argument
of
it
in
terms
of
where's
the
court
should
consider
not
having
the
record
before
it.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
it
did
involve
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
and
that
--
the
leading
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
i'd
certainly
wouldn't
deny
you
that
prerogative
--
i
would
say
though,
and
that's
why
i
think
i
cast
this
more
in
terms
the
practical
difficulty
of
applying
a
statute
to
a
set
of
facts
that
are
non-existing.
i
think
justice
frankfurter
said
one
case
is
like
playing
hammer
without
hammer.
and
i
think
that's
what
we
have
here
and
i
think
their
statutes
are
come
under
free
speech
restrictions
that
this
court
can
look
at
it
and
has
looked
at
and
said
these
are
patently
and
on
their
face
unconstitutionally
void
for
vagueness.
but
i
don't
think
this
is
that
kind
of
statute.
it's
talking
about
conduct
which
is
not
within
the
constitutionally
protected
area
and
i
think
in
that
type
of
case
and
the
cases
that
i
cited
in
my
brief
on
this
point
that
the
court
should
have
the
facts
before
it,
and
if
it
doesn't
that's
fatal.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
six
months
maximum.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
i'm
relying
on
17-360
but
the
different
part
of
it.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
persons
who
maybe
committed
to
this
institution,
persons
who
plead
guilty
to
the
commission
of
felonies
which
this
is
not,
second
persons
convicted
of
or
who
plead
guilty
to
the
commission
of
misdemeanors
including
prostitution,
intoxication,
drug
using
and
disorderly
conduct.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
no,
but
that's
--
i
will
take
that
to
mean
including,
but
not
eliminating
or
not
being
exclusive.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes.
the
commission
of
misdemeanor
including
the
prostitution,
intoxication,
drug
using
and
disorderly
conduct,
and
third
unmarried
girls
between
the
ages
16
and
21
or
manifest
danger
falling
into
habits
of
vise
which
was
the
other
--
which
was
the
commitment
provision
for
the
conviction
under
section
17-379.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
if
i
may
just
take
section
17-379
which
was
the
actual
conviction
for
manifest
danger
falling
to
habits
of
vise,
17-379
says,
“any
unmarried
female
between
the
ages
of
16
and
21
who
is
in
manifest
danger
of
falling
to
habits
of
vise
or
leading
the
vicious
life
or
who
has
committed
any
crime
upon
the
complaint
maybe
brought
before
the
court
and
committed.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
in
effect
that
she
maybe
committed
to
the
connecticut
state
farm
for
women
until
she's
21.
in
this
section,
it
doesn't
mentioned
the
connecticut
state
farm
for
women,
but
there's
no
question
that
that's
what
it's
talking
about,
the
institution
that
it's
talking
about.
so,
she's
convicted
of
17-379
--
she's
convicted
of
manifest
danger
under
17-379.
under
53-219,
she's
convicted
of
lascivious
carriage.
and
either
the
words
in
17-379
or
who
has
committed
any
crime
or
the
words
that
i
read
before
in
17-360,
the
commission
of
misdemeanors
including
prostitution,
etcetera,
are
applicable.
and
she
has
committed
under
the
maximum
three-year
sentence
in
17-360
for
the
crime
of
lascivious
carriage
as
well
as
for
the
manifest
danger
falling
into
vise
charge
under
the
two
statutes,
53-219
and
17-379.
17-360
says
she
has
to
stay
there
for
a
maximum
of
three
years
including
parole.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
well,
no.
i
should
say
she
just
exposed
to
being
there
for
three
years.
that's
the
maximum
sentence
since
three
years
is
the
maximum
sentence.
and
there's
confusion
in
17-379
which
says
21
but
as
we
said
earlier
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
as
to
this
young
lady,
17-360
three-year
maximum
is
applicable
because
it
would
be
longer
than
that
to
make
to
have
her
attain
21
and
the
lesser
is
applicable.
so,
under
17-360,
she
has
a
maximum
exposure
of
three
years
on
both
the
charges
of
which
she
was
convicted.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
it's
a
little
--
pardon
me
your
honor?
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
there's
an
information
in
the
substitute
information
in
the
record
and
the
information
that's
applicable
is
on
page
--
well,
its
right
after
page
4
and
it's
called
the
substitute
information.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
that's
what
falling
into
habits
of
vise,
yes
sir.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
it's
a
danger,
yes.
it's
--
the
word
“danger”
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
there's
a
course
of
conduct
and
if
the
conduct
were
before
the
court,
it
would
be
clear
that
there's
more
than
a
danger.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
no.
that's
right.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
i
--
i
don't
think
there's
been
a
case
that's
all
applicable,
no.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
oh,
no.
there
have
been
convictions
on
this,
but
there's
no
appellate
decision
on
the
statute
as
far
as
i
know
that
has
any
bearing
on
the
problem
before
us
now.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
i
know
there's
been
a
convictions
because
i
have
been
prosecuting
for
long
time
and
i
know
that
other
prosecutors
in
fact
in
their
brief,
they
--
the
appellant
sets
forth
the
use
of
the
statute
by
prosecutors
in
the
state
of
connecticut.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
well,
i'm
saying
your
honor
that
the
case
that
i'm
referring
to
are
all
for
conduct,
although
i
have
to
agree
with
you.
the
statute
says
danger
of
falling
into
habits
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
well,
i
wouldn't
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
i
wouldn't
defend
the
statute
at
all,
your
honor,
if
i
didn't
believe
that
to
mean
a
criminal.
a
criminal
--
the
criminal
conduct
had
to
be
invalid,
and
i
think
the
other
words
of
that
statute
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
there
are
degrees
of
vise
your
honor.
i
don't
think
the
statute
should
be
or
could
be
properly
applied
unless
the
danger
had
been
realized.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
oh,
well,
there's
a
maximum
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
we
can
avoid
the
penal
nature
of
this.
that's
the
idea,
to
rehabilitate
it.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
well,
she's
out
of
there
now
anyhow,
but
the
fact
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
well,
their
point
is
that
she's
on
parole
and
the
parole
continues
until
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
she's
on
parole
i
think
it
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
i
don't
claim
it's
moot,
no,
but
i
claim
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
--
i
don't
think
that's
technically
mootness,
but
we
certainly
raise
that
argument
very
strongly.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
that
is
correct
analysis
but
i
don't
think
that
the
sentencing
provisions
are
really
not
much
of
the
chinese
puzzle.
maybe
i'm
going
more
by
practice
than
by
what's
spelled
out.
but
i
think
but
i
think
if
you
read
379
and
360
and
53-219
that
there's
no
question
that
she
is
properly
sent
there
for
three
years
under
53-219.
and
these
decisions
mentioned
by
counsel,
i
don't
believe
that
fact
in
this
case.
and
i
just
--
if
i
may
add
a
word
on
the
vise.
when
we're
talking
about
vise,
i
think
it's
clear
from
the
context
of
the
statute;
the
other
language
in
the
statute
that
it's
criminal
vise
--
have
a
vise
of
smoking
cigarettes
or
all
kinds
of
vises
which
were
used
more
even
incuriously
than
that
of
course,
but
the
whole
context
of
this
is
talking
about
criminal
vise
and
the
type
of
vise
we
think
of
when
we
think
of
a
vise
squad
and
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
i
think
most
of
the
cases
that
have
come
up
under
this
would
be
covered
by
specific
criminal
conduct,
yes
sir.
and
i
think
it's
broader
because
of
the
fact
that
this
category
of
young
person
was
regarded
as
being
in
need
of
particular
treatment.
now
this,
were
drinking
involved
in
the
case
to
this
type
of
drinking
may
not
have
--
on
her
part
may
not
have
fit
a
specific
criminal
crime
--
criminal
offense
in
connecticut,
but
she
was
at
the
time
of
16-year-old
girl
drinking
wine
while
this
other
business
is
going
on.
that
particular
conduct
which
was
in
the
record,
i
mean
the
testimony.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
16
your
honor,
except
that
between
16
and
18,
the
adult
court
can
refer
them
if
they
think
they
are
amenable
to
juvenile
court
jurisdiction.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
not
unless
she
was
referred
by
the
court
that
heard
this
case
prior
to
the
court
hearing.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
that
court
could
have
it,
but
the
court
had
background
of
reasons
why
it
didn't.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
i
mentioned
that
as
vise
perhaps
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
but
i
don't
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
well,
presently
isn't
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
a
person
presently
is
not
protected
from
that
particular
vise
by
legislation,
and
this
particular
kind
of
vise
that
we're
talking
about
here
we
maintain,
does
protect
society
and
a
young
lady
such
as
this
one
by
criminal
sanctions
or
queasy
criminal
sanctions.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
i
try
to
think
of
the
answer
judge.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
i
didn't
realize
that,
may
i
--
excuse
me
mr.
justice.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
i'm
still
trying
to
come
up
with
something
to
answer
that.
well,
your
honor,
it
could
come
to
that.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
a
statute
could
be
pass.
i
don't
know
whether
it
would
be
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
under
this
statute?
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
no,
because
i
think
that
the
other
words
of
the
statute
make
it
clear
that
this
is
criminal
vise
and
habits
of
vise.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
when
read
in
context,
it
says
that
to
me
and
i
point
that
out
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
well,
here's
what
i
said
in
that
respect.
the
word
“vise”
must
be
read
in
the
context
of
the
general
statutory
scheme
and
injuncts
the
position
to
the
phrase
“or
who
has
committed
any
crime”
which
is
in
this
statute.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
it's
a
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
or
you
know
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
well,
it's
a
matter
of
interpretation.
i
claim
the
only
fair
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
that
its
criminal
vise
that
it's
talking
about
because
otherwise
you
could
take
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
your
honor,
it
certainly
isn't
and
it
applies
into
much
more
in
aqueous
things
in
cigarette
smoking.
my
vise
is
that
i
don't
hear
the
alarm
clock
in
the
morning
or
something
to
that
effect,
that
could
be
a
vise
and
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
certainly
would
but
i
think
that
that
the
only
fair
construction
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
well,
i
made
it
clear
that
it
has
a
very
broad
meaning,
but
i
also
would
like
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
for
everyone?
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
broad,
broad,
but
i
also
like
to
make
it
clear
that
i
think
the
only
fair
construction
of
this
statute
is
that
its
criminal
vise
it's
being
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
well,
if
the
court
had
before
the
conduct
of
the
person,
it
could
judge
couldn't
it
whether
or
not
that
was
the
type
of
vise
he
could
constitutionally
be
proscribed?
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
i
don't
mean
to
ask
you
the
question
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
statute
--
you'd
start
with
the
assumption,
your
honor,
that
the
statute
should
be
construe
so
that
if
reasonably
possible,
its
constitutionality
should
be
upheld
and
i
don't
think
that's
very
difficult
with
this
type
of
statute.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
you
should
get
to
that
your
honor.
i
don't
think
you
should
get
to
that.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
but
i
think
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
sir.
but
i
think
because
this
conviction
stands
on
independent
state
grounds
and
because
you
don't
have
the
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
the
conviction
under
the
other
statute.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
that
other
statute?
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
it's
a
long
way
from
it
sir?
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
no,
it's
a
lot
like
it.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
it's
a
lot
like
it,
its
lascivious
carriage
its
call.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
lascivious
carriage.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
carriage,
demeanor,
comportment.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
it's
a
claim
to
--
the
carriage
in
the
sense
of
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
--
of
comportment
or
demeanor.
that's
an
interest
thing.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
well,
it
would
have
to
conduct.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
walking
is
--
lascivious
lewd
want
them
type
of
conduct
is
what
is
meant.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
no,
i'm
thinking
about
that
in
terms
of
the
question,
but
that
statute
is
under
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
there
might
well
be,
but
that
statute
is
not
being
attacked
here.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
it
does
only
insofar
as
it's
the
sentence
arising
from
it
provides
an
independent
state
ground
for
the
validity
of
this
conviction
in
sentence
in
the
other
one.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
think
mr.
grosby
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
except
that
the
statute
provides,
yes
sir.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
really
no
quarrel
about
the
facts
as
recited
by
mr.
grosby.
the
state
does
however
wants
to
--
i
would
do
respect
correct
two
things
in
those
facts
and
that
is
the
age
of
statute.
53-379
was
originally
passed
in
1905
in
substantially
its
present
form
and
mr.
grosby's
reference
to
the
states
brief
in
terms
of
legislative
history
really
was
in
connection
with
17-360
which
is
the
commitment
vehicle
statute.
so,
that
the
statute
really
goes
back
to
1905,
the
words
“manifest
danger”
falling
in
to
habits
of
vise,
but
that's
when
they
first
appear
as
far
as
i
know
in
our
law.
there
is
another
dispute
or
--
i
don't
think
it's
really
a
dispute
but
it
disparity
in
facts.
this
girl
was
17
when
she
was
convicted
and
as
i
set
forth
in
our
brief,
her
birthday
was
april
15,
1949
and
there's
a
great
deal
of
confusion
even
in
the
record
and
in
the
decision
of
our
appellate
division.
i
believe
they
say
that
she
was
18
but
that
is
incorrect.
she
was
born
1949
convicted
in
june
of
1966.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
does.
no,
it
does
not
that
mr.
justice
but
it
may
have
a
bearing
in
terms
of
the
applicability
of
the
three
year
maximum
provision
for
the
age
21.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
now,
on
section
53-279
which
is
the
statute
--
i'm
sorry,
17-379
which
is
the
statute
that's
under
appeal
here,
17-379
in
which
are
contain
the
words
“manifest
danger
fall
into
vise”
--
habit
to
vise.
it
says
until
she
is
21
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
--
in
any
unmarried
female
between
16
and
21,
she'll
be
committed
there
until
she's
21,
but
section
17-360
which
i
think
we
can
agree
is
the
actual
committing
vehicle.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
limits
it
to
a
maximum
of
three
years.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
so,
you
have
a
certain
dilemma
there
and
in
our
brief
in
appendix
a,
we
set
forth
in
attorney
general's
opinion
in
which
he
said
the
numbers
of
the
statutes
were
different
then,
but
i
don't
think
there's
any
quarrel
about
this.
if
the
girl
becomes
21
first,
then
she
has
to
be
release
or
three
years.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
which
ever
is
earlier
and
i
set
that
forth
in
my
brief
as
an
opinion
but
it's
but
--
just
by
the
attorney
general's
opinion
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
real
quarrel
about
that.
now,
in
terms
--
if
your
question
her
age
would
have
an
effect
on
that.
in
other
words,
if
she's
17
as
i
claim
she
is
and
she
was,
she's
born
1949,
then
her
time
would
be
up
in
three
years
that
when
she
reach
21.
so,
she'd
be
release
in
--
or
she'd
be
free
from
parole
in
june
of
1969.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
under
the
falling
into
danger.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
oh,
no
mr.
justice.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
and
that's
our
main
argument
if
i
may
that
this
conviction
and
sentence
stand
an
independent
state
grounds;
namely
the
conviction
on
lascivious
carriage
charge
under
53-219.
now,
that
is
--
that
statute
was
--
she
received
the
concurrent
sentence
and
the
sentencing
provisions
again
are
under
17-360.
the
same
sentencing
vehicle
or
the
same
sentencing
maximum
sentence,
namely
the
three
years
are
applicable
to
this
girl
and
she
was
discharged
of
which
she
was
convicted
lascivious
carriage
at
the
same
trial
was
not
appealed.
there's
no
appeal
from
that
statute.
there's
no
habeas
corpus
involved
in
it.
and
in
addition
to
mr.
justice
white's
noting
the
fact
that
there
is
no
comparable
statute
for
men
not
only
of
the
sentences
to
different
agree
maximum
sentences
are
different,
but
there's
no
statute
comparable
to
manifest
danger
falling
into
habits
of
vise
for
young
men.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
it
was.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
and
that's
correct
mr.
justice
and
my
argument
is
more
than
that.
it's
also
that
those
decisions
are
not
binding
here
at
all.
this
statute,
53-219,
is
not
before
the
court
at
all
and
that's
why
under
the
line
of
case
is
cited
in
the
brief,
i
claim
that
render
for
threshold
of
this
whole
case,
the
court
is
met
by
a
conviction
without
infirmity
on
another
statute
with
the
concurrent
sentence
because
there's
nothing
here
before
the
court
that
says
that
the
limitation
on
53-219
conviction
is
two
years
as
far
as
--
especially
as
far
as
young
girls
between
16
and
21
are
concerned.
there's
nothing
to
that
effect
before
the
court
when
that
girl
was
sentenced
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
well,
i
claim
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
this
is
a
direct
appeal.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
i
take
issue
with
that
because
of
the
fact
that
the
highest
court
of
connecticut
is
not
said
so
and
the
fact
is
that
the
only
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
he
can
make
the
claim
that
it's
a
denial
of
equal
protection
but
i
can
make
the
claim
that
this
convictions
stands
on
the
independent
state
grounds.
the
highest
court
of
state
of
connecticut
has
not
set
that
there's
any
two-year
limitation
under
section
53-219
in
which
she
was
duly
convicted.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
no
appeal
was
ever
taken
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
and
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
i
don't
understand
the
question.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
i
said
it.
i
say
that
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
that's
right.
there
is
been
no
ruling
administratively
or
otherwise
or
no
decision
of
the
connecticut
supreme
court
then
in
the
case
like
this
with
the
minor
female,
16
--
between
16
and
21
convicted
of
lascivious
carriage
that
the
maximum
sentence
should
be
anything
less
than
three
years.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
and
they
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
well,
i
think
yes
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
i'm
saying
more
than
that.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
from
the
denial
of
the
demur.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
on
53
--
excuse
me.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
it
should've
been
brought
by
appeal
or
by
habeas
corpus
if
they
want
to
attack
that
sentence,
but
the
sentence
standards,
there's
maximum
of
three
years.
there's
no
change
in
that
sentence.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
i
think
that
there
are
at
least,
that
the
word
“vise”
is
at
least
this
clear
in
common
language
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
that's
a
hard
thing
to
answer
mr.
justice
as
a
matter
of
degree.
i
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
i
think
vise
is
prefers
more
clear.
and
if
i
may
just
to
expound
from
that,
a
federal
case
which
didn't
involved
with
criminal
conviction
but
did
say
about
vise
that
nothing
is
--
well,
i'll
paraphrase
it,
nothing
is
more
clear
that
promiscuous
and
uninhibited
sexual
intercourse
is
vise
that
that's
--
if
anything
is
vise,
that's
it.
and
you
see
here
unfortunately,
we
don't
have
the
facts
before
the
court
to
or
the
record
of
the
conduct
of
this
young
woman
to
measure
against
the
words
of
the
statute
because
i
think
this
is
a
type
of
statute
that
in
certain
cases
could
be
applied
in
nonconstitutional
manner.
it
is
not
unconstitutionally
void
for
vagueness
on
its
face
but
that
the
court
should
have
the
benefit
of
the
conduct
to
measure
against
the
words
of
the
statute.
and
after
all,
isn't
that
only
logical
because
the
reasons
for
the
statute
being
void
for
vagueness
and
therefore
denial
of
due
process
are
to,
primarily
that
the
actor
doesn't
know
what
conduct
is
proscribed.
well,
i
say
that
the
record
of
this
case
would
reveal
that
this
actor
or
any
actor
would
know
that
the
conduct
would
come
within
the
purview
of
the
word
“vise”,
but
not
having
that
before
it
is
another
reason.
the
state
maintains
that
the
court
should
not
disturb
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
it
wasn't
made
a
part
of
the
record.
you
mean
the
transcript
your
honor
of
the
evidence?
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
the
court
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
are
not
the
way
the
appeal
was
taken,
no
because
it
was
just
an
appeal
from
the
overruling
of
the
demur.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
oh,
well,
yes
i
do
because
under
our
practice
in
the
case
that
i've
cited
in
my
brief
called
state
versus
sol
is
that
you
cannot
--
the
overrule
by
a
demur
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
then
proceed
to
a
full
trial
and
be
convicted
and
then
appeal
the
overruling
of
the
demur
without
any
evidence
before
the
appellate
court.
that's
our
law
under
the
case
of
state
versus
sol.
i
should
add
as
i
did
in
the
brief
however
that
the
court
said
but
anyhow,
we're
going
to
look
at
the
situation
because
of
the
constitutional
issues
that
were
involved.
but
they
clearly
set
forth
in
the
connecticut
law
and
namely
there
shouldn't
be
here
or
shouldn't
be
in
the
connecticut
appellate
court
in
this
form
because
the
demur,
having
been
overruled,
then
the
trial,
and
then
the
conviction
mr.
defense
counsel
made
a
motion
dismiss
that
on
the
appeal,
the
record
of
that
trial
should
be
before
the
court.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
the
overruling
the
demur.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
i
do
because
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
i
don't
know
if
i
argue
just
in
the
terms
that
chief
justice
means
but
i
argue
with
in
terms
of
the
state
--
this
court
being
unable
to
pass
upon
the
statute
without
having
before
it
the
facts
that
were
brought
out
at
the
trial
and
were
the
basis
of
her
conviction
under
it.
i
haven't
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
it
is
but
i
think
mr.
chief
justice's
point
that
i
have
made
a
procedural
argument
on
that.
i
made
--
i've
tried
to
make
a
substantive
argument
of
it
in
terms
of
where's
the
court
should
consider
not
having
the
record
before
it.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
it
did
involve
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
and
that
--
the
leading
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
i'd
certainly
wouldn't
deny
you
that
prerogative
--
i
would
say
though,
and
that's
why
i
think
i
cast
this
more
in
terms
the
practical
difficulty
of
applying
a
statute
to
a
set
of
facts
that
are
non-existing.
i
think
justice
frankfurter
said
one
case
is
like
playing
hammer
without
hammer.
and
i
think
that's
what
we
have
here
and
i
think
their
statutes
are
come
under
free
speech
restrictions
that
this
court
can
look
at
it
and
has
looked
at
and
said
these
are
patently
and
on
their
face
unconstitutionally
void
for
vagueness.
but
i
don't
think
this
is
that
kind
of
statute.
it's
talking
about
conduct
which
is
not
within
the
constitutionally
protected
area
and
i
think
in
that
type
of
case
and
the
cases
that
i
cited
in
my
brief
on
this
point
that
the
court
should
have
the
facts
before
it,
and
if
it
doesn't
that's
fatal.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
six
months
maximum.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
i'm
relying
on
17-360
but
the
different
part
of
it.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
persons
who
maybe
committed
to
this
institution,
persons
who
plead
guilty
to
the
commission
of
felonies
which
this
is
not,
second
persons
convicted
of
or
who
plead
guilty
to
the
commission
of
misdemeanors
including
prostitution,
intoxication,
drug
using
and
disorderly
conduct.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
no,
but
that's
--
i
will
take
that
to
mean
including,
but
not
eliminating
or
not
being
exclusive.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes.
the
commission
of
misdemeanor
including
the
prostitution,
intoxication,
drug
using
and
disorderly
conduct,
and
third
unmarried
girls
between
the
ages
16
and
21
or
manifest
danger
falling
into
habits
of
vise
which
was
the
other
--
which
was
the
commitment
provision
for
the
conviction
under
section
17-379.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
if
i
may
just
take
section
17-379
which
was
the
actual
conviction
for
manifest
danger
falling
to
habits
of
vise,
17-379
says,
“any
unmarried
female
between
the
ages
of
16
and
21
who
is
in
manifest
danger
of
falling
to
habits
of
vise
or
leading
the
vicious
life
or
who
has
committed
any
crime
upon
the
complaint
maybe
brought
before
the
court
and
committed.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
in
effect
that
she
maybe
committed
to
the
connecticut
state
farm
for
women
until
she's
21.
in
this
section,
it
doesn't
mentioned
the
connecticut
state
farm
for
women,
but
there's
no
question
that
that's
what
it's
talking
about,
the
institution
that
it's
talking
about.
so,
she's
convicted
of
17-379
--
she's
convicted
of
manifest
danger
under
17-379.
under
53-219,
she's
convicted
of
lascivious
carriage.
and
either
the
words
in
17-379
or
who
has
committed
any
crime
or
the
words
that
i
read
before
in
17-360,
the
commission
of
misdemeanors
including
prostitution,
etcetera,
are
applicable.
and
she
has
committed
under
the
maximum
three-year
sentence
in
17-360
for
the
crime
of
lascivious
carriage
as
well
as
for
the
manifest
danger
falling
into
vise
charge
under
the
two
statutes,
53-219
and
17-379.
17-360
says
she
has
to
stay
there
for
a
maximum
of
three
years
including
parole.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
well,
no.
i
should
say
she
just
exposed
to
being
there
for
three
years.
that's
the
maximum
sentence
since
three
years
is
the
maximum
sentence.
and
there's
confusion
in
17-379
which
says
21
but
as
we
said
earlier
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
as
to
this
young
lady,
17-360
three-year
maximum
is
applicable
because
it
would
be
longer
than
that
to
make
to
have
her
attain
21
and
the
lesser
is
applicable.
so,
under
17-360,
she
has
a
maximum
exposure
of
three
years
on
both
the
charges
of
which
she
was
convicted.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
it's
a
little
--
pardon
me
your
honor?
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
there's
an
information
in
the
substitute
information
in
the
record
and
the
information
that's
applicable
is
on
page
--
well,
its
right
after
page
4
and
it's
called
the
substitute
information.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
that's
what
falling
into
habits
of
vise,
yes
sir.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
it's
a
danger,
yes.
it's
--
the
word
“danger”
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
there's
a
course
of
conduct
and
if
the
conduct
were
before
the
court,
it
would
be
clear
that
there's
more
than
a
danger.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
no.
that's
right.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
i
--
i
don't
think
there's
been
a
case
that's
all
applicable,
no.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
oh,
no.
there
have
been
convictions
on
this,
but
there's
no
appellate
decision
on
the
statute
as
far
as
i
know
that
has
any
bearing
on
the
problem
before
us
now.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
i
know
there's
been
a
convictions
because
i
have
been
prosecuting
for
long
time
and
i
know
that
other
prosecutors
in
fact
in
their
brief,
they
--
the
appellant
sets
forth
the
use
of
the
statute
by
prosecutors
in
the
state
of
connecticut.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
well,
i'm
saying
your
honor
that
the
case
that
i'm
referring
to
are
all
for
conduct,
although
i
have
to
agree
with
you.
the
statute
says
danger
of
falling
into
habits
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
well,
i
wouldn't
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
i
wouldn't
defend
the
statute
at
all,
your
honor,
if
i
didn't
believe
that
to
mean
a
criminal.
a
criminal
--
the
criminal
conduct
had
to
be
invalid,
and
i
think
the
other
words
of
that
statute
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
there
are
degrees
of
vise
your
honor.
i
don't
think
the
statute
should
be
or
could
be
properly
applied
unless
the
danger
had
been
realized.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
oh,
well,
there's
a
maximum
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
we
can
avoid
the
penal
nature
of
this.
that's
the
idea,
to
rehabilitate
it.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
well,
she's
out
of
there
now
anyhow,
but
the
fact
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
well,
their
point
is
that
she's
on
parole
and
the
parole
continues
until
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
she's
on
parole
i
think
it
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
i
don't
claim
it's
moot,
no,
but
i
claim
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
--
i
don't
think
that's
technically
mootness,
but
we
certainly
raise
that
argument
very
strongly.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
that
is
correct
analysis
but
i
don't
think
that
the
sentencing
provisions
are
really
not
much
of
the
chinese
puzzle.
maybe
i'm
going
more
by
practice
than
by
what's
spelled
out.
but
i
think
but
i
think
if
you
read
379
and
360
and
53-219
that
there's
no
question
that
she
is
properly
sent
there
for
three
years
under
53-219.
and
these
decisions
mentioned
by
counsel,
i
don't
believe
that
fact
in
this
case.
and
i
just
--
if
i
may
add
a
word
on
the
vise.
when
we're
talking
about
vise,
i
think
it's
clear
from
the
context
of
the
statute;
the
other
language
in
the
statute
that
it's
criminal
vise
--
have
a
vise
of
smoking
cigarettes
or
all
kinds
of
vises
which
were
used
more
even
incuriously
than
that
of
course,
but
the
whole
context
of
this
is
talking
about
criminal
vise
and
the
type
of
vise
we
think
of
when
we
think
of
a
vise
squad
and
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
i
think
most
of
the
cases
that
have
come
up
under
this
would
be
covered
by
specific
criminal
conduct,
yes
sir.
and
i
think
it's
broader
because
of
the
fact
that
this
category
of
young
person
was
regarded
as
being
in
need
of
particular
treatment.
now
this,
were
drinking
involved
in
the
case
to
this
type
of
drinking
may
not
have
--
on
her
part
may
not
have
fit
a
specific
criminal
crime
--
criminal
offense
in
connecticut,
but
she
was
at
the
time
of
16-year-old
girl
drinking
wine
while
this
other
business
is
going
on.
that
particular
conduct
which
was
in
the
record,
i
mean
the
testimony.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
16
your
honor,
except
that
between
16
and
18,
the
adult
court
can
refer
them
if
they
think
they
are
amenable
to
juvenile
court
jurisdiction.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
not
unless
she
was
referred
by
the
court
that
heard
this
case
prior
to
the
court
hearing.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
that
court
could
have
it,
but
the
court
had
background
of
reasons
why
it
didn't.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
i
mentioned
that
as
vise
perhaps
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
but
i
don't
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
well,
presently
isn't
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
a
person
presently
is
not
protected
from
that
particular
vise
by
legislation,
and
this
particular
kind
of
vise
that
we're
talking
about
here
we
maintain,
does
protect
society
and
a
young
lady
such
as
this
one
by
criminal
sanctions
or
queasy
criminal
sanctions.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
i
try
to
think
of
the
answer
judge.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
i
didn't
realize
that,
may
i
--
excuse
me
mr.
justice.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
i'm
still
trying
to
come
up
with
something
to
answer
that.
well,
your
honor,
it
could
come
to
that.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
a
statute
could
be
pass.
i
don't
know
whether
it
would
be
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
under
this
statute?
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
no,
because
i
think
that
the
other
words
of
the
statute
make
it
clear
that
this
is
criminal
vise
and
habits
of
vise.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
when
read
in
context,
it
says
that
to
me
and
i
point
that
out
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
well,
here's
what
i
said
in
that
respect.
the
word
“vise”
must
be
read
in
the
context
of
the
general
statutory
scheme
and
injuncts
the
position
to
the
phrase
“or
who
has
committed
any
crime”
which
is
in
this
statute.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
it's
a
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
or
you
know
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
well,
it's
a
matter
of
interpretation.
i
claim
the
only
fair
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
that
its
criminal
vise
that
it's
talking
about
because
otherwise
you
could
take
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
your
honor,
it
certainly
isn't
and
it
applies
into
much
more
in
aqueous
things
in
cigarette
smoking.
my
vise
is
that
i
don't
hear
the
alarm
clock
in
the
morning
or
something
to
that
effect,
that
could
be
a
vise
and
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
certainly
would
but
i
think
that
that
the
only
fair
construction
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
well,
i
made
it
clear
that
it
has
a
very
broad
meaning,
but
i
also
would
like
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
for
everyone?
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
broad,
broad,
but
i
also
like
to
make
it
clear
that
i
think
the
only
fair
construction
of
this
statute
is
that
its
criminal
vise
it's
being
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
well,
if
the
court
had
before
the
conduct
of
the
person,
it
could
judge
couldn't
it
whether
or
not
that
was
the
type
of
vise
he
could
constitutionally
be
proscribed?
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
i
don't
mean
to
ask
you
the
question
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
statute
--
you'd
start
with
the
assumption,
your
honor,
that
the
statute
should
be
construe
so
that
if
reasonably
possible,
its
constitutionality
should
be
upheld
and
i
don't
think
that's
very
difficult
with
this
type
of
statute.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
you
should
get
to
that
your
honor.
i
don't
think
you
should
get
to
that.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
but
i
think
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
sir.
but
i
think
because
this
conviction
stands
on
independent
state
grounds
and
because
you
don't
have
the
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
the
conviction
under
the
other
statute.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
that
other
statute?
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
it's
a
long
way
from
it
sir?
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
no,
it's
a
lot
like
it.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
it's
a
lot
like
it,
its
lascivious
carriage
its
call.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
lascivious
carriage.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
carriage,
demeanor,
comportment.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
it's
a
claim
to
--
the
carriage
in
the
sense
of
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
--
of
comportment
or
demeanor.
that's
an
interest
thing.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
well,
it
would
have
to
conduct.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
walking
is
--
lascivious
lewd
want
them
type
of
conduct
is
what
is
meant.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
no,
i'm
thinking
about
that
in
terms
of
the
question,
but
that
statute
is
under
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
there
might
well
be,
but
that
statute
is
not
being
attacked
here.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
it
does
only
insofar
as
it's
the
sentence
arising
from
it
provides
an
independent
state
ground
for
the
validity
of
this
conviction
in
sentence
in
the
other
one.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
think
mr.
grosby
--
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
except
that
the
statute
provides,
yes
sir.
mr.
george
f.
carroll,
jr.
thank
you.
