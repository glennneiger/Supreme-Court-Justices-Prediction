is
it
clear
what
sentence,
he
is
now
serving?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
carroll.
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
the
statute
that
she
was
convicted
on
and
i
understand
from
your
brief
at
page
13,
am
i
correct
that
you
take
the
position
that
vise
and
habits
of
vise
are
no
more
or
no
less
on
ambiguous
in
the
word
“obscene”,
is
that
position
you
take?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
no
more
so
than
obscene?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
just
want
to
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
carroll
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
carroll,
--
oh,
excuse
chief.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
only
point
i
have
mr.
carroll
was
that
there
are
no
decisions
in
connecticut
interpreting
the
statute.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that
in
fact,
it's
up
to
the
trial
judge
who
happens
to
try
the
case
to
decide
whether
this
in
vise
or
not
or
whether
time
of
the
statute
or
not
without
any
guidelines
at
all.
