justice
thurgood
marshall
what
constitutional
right
are
you
asserting?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
let's
put,
what
constitutional
section
are
you
relying
on?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
the
denial
of
due
process
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
was
it
denied
or
was
there
a
dispute
as
to
whether
it
was
then
in
existence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
time
it
was
asked
for.
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
there
dispute
as
to
whether
it
was
in
existence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
a
question
of
fact?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
a
question
of
fact?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
a
constitutional
question?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
facts
in
that
constitutional.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
constitution
of
section
does
that
deal
with?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
a
matter
fact
it's
all
the
question
of
fact
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
have
gotten
to
there,
i
was
left
with
the
point
that
i
don't
know
as
of
right
now
whether
those
tapes
were
in
existence
at
the
time
you
are
talking
about
i
don't
know.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
don't
know.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
nobody
knows.
justice
thurgood
marshall
at
that
time,
they
were
in
the
navy's
hand
at
that
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
didn't
they,
wasn't
there
evident
testimony
to
the
fact
that
it
could
have
very
have
been
destroyed,
they
couldn't
find
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
could
have
been
expunged.
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
isn't
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
burns
didn't
involve
sara.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
wanted
to
claim
article
76
unconstitutional?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
sharlitt,
suppose
a
serviceman
was
found
guilty
of
some
minor
charge
and
given
six
months
without
salary
and
he
is
still
in
army,
its
your
position
that
he
could
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
say
i
didn't
get
my
jencks
act
materials,
so
i
want
my
salary.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no
he
is
out,
he
served
his
six
months
in
stock
clearing
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
is
still
in
army.
he
could
go
to
the
court
of
claims
and
litigate
his
back
pay
for
that
six
months.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
no
my
point
is,
he
just
alleges
that
he
was
denied
jencks
act
material.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
else
would
he
have
to
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
alright,
then
he
sends
the
record
which
shows
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
is
he
is
still
over
in
the
germany
but
the
court
of
claims
has
given
his
back
pay.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
what
happens
to
the
army
discipline
in
the
mean
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
happens
to
army
discipline
in
that
regiment
in
the
mean
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
the
court
of
claim
moves
in
and
upsets
the
army
discipline.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
i
don't
think
army
discipline
as
of
now
is
involved
with
your
commander
because
he
is
out
and
this
man
is
still
in.
justice
thurgood
marshall
discipline
does.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that
on
the
out,
there
are
no
judgment
of
a
court-martial
would
be
final
until
passed
on
by
the
court
of
claims.
justice
thurgood
marshall
close.
justice
thurgood
marshall
for
this
case,
well
i
am
looking
for
the
future.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
be
that
they
read
article
76
to
say
that
no
court
has
jurisdiction.
couldn't
it
be
that
these
people
that
didn't
go
to
the
court
of
claims
read
that
literally,
that
the
court
didn't
have
jurisdictions,
so
why
waste
of
time.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
to
show
that
he
did
partner
himself
in
this
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
shows
the
credibility
doesn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
credibility
is
a
little
below
a
constitutional
question,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
still
one
witness's
credibility.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
normally
in
an
ordinary
criminal
trial
you
know
the
credibility
left
to
the
triar
of
facts
usually.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
who
is
to
be
the
judge
of
that?
the
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
anything
in
your
case
other
than
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
this
man
still
in
the
army?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
is
still
serving?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
is
in
air
force.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
want
us
to
approve
paying
him
his
back
pay.
justice
thurgood
marshall
while
he's
still
in
the
air
force?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
don't
see
a
disciplinary
problem
either
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
that's
just
like
an
instruction
isn't?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
didn't
she
also
testify
that
they
would
punch
it
twice
in
the
same
hole
on
his
ration
card?
justice
thurgood
marshall
somebody
did
in
the
record.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
would
look
like
it
was
getting
more
than
the
usual
amount.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
would
usually
save
hole
for
two
cottons.
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
great
difficulty
is
that
none
of
that
is
in
the
purview
of
the
court
of
claims.
so
all
in
the
court
of
claims
can
do
is
to
give
him
his
back
pay.
justice
thurgood
marshall
period.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
can
the
court
of
claims
issue
writ
of
habeas
corpus?
justice
thurgood
marshall
of
course
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
why
you
are
trying
to
put
them
together?
court
of
claims
is
the
court
of
limited
jurisdiction.
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
look
on
whether
or
not
gets
his
back
pay.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
going
to
extend
the
court
of
claims
jurisdiction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
that's
what
you
want
to
do
now.
you
want
to
get
us
to
pay
us
on
and
so
you
can
go
to
the
correction
of
records
board
in
the
air
force,
is
that
what
you
want?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
have
you
applied
there
yet?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
is
it
being
held?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
have
they
ruled?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
denied
it,
so
you
really
appealing
from
that
denial
aren't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
go
to
the
court
on
military
appeals?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
the
court
of
claims.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
does
that
say?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
says
officers.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
constitutional
right
are
you
asserting?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
let's
put,
what
constitutional
section
are
you
relying
on?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
the
denial
of

here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
was
it
denied
or
was
there
a
dispute
as
to
whether
it
was
then
in
existence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
time
it
was
asked
for.
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
there
dispute
as
to
whether
it
was
in
existence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
a
question
of

justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
a
question
of
fact?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
a
constitutional
question?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
facts
in
that
constitutional.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
constitution
of
section
does
that
deal
with?
justice
thurgood

it's
