justice
abe
fortas
well,
your
point
really
is
article
76
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice;
page
two
of
your
brief
should
be
read
to
mean
that
the
judgments
are
not
only
final
and
conclusive,
but
that
they
must
be
accepted
as
concluding
of
--
as
final
and
conclusive
in
a
subsequent
civil
suit.
justice
abe
fortas
so,
let
us
assume
mr.
weisl
that
all
of
the
proceedings
were
held
in
the
courts
of
military
justice
and
no
question
about
them.
your
position
has
to
be
that
when
the
defendant
in
the
criminal
case
or
whatever
it
is
called.
in
the
military
--
before
the
military
courts
files
an
action
for
back
pay
in
the
court
of
claims,
a
separate
jurisprudential
system
that
the
-–
that
court
cannot
then
go
into
any
questions
at
all.
justice
abe
fortas
as
far
as
that
court
of
claims
discovers
that
or
concludes
that
the
military
courts
and
no
jurisdiction.
and
that
therefore
over
the
offense
charge
and
that
therefore
the
soldier
was
wrongly
separated
from
the
service,
but
on
a
jurisdictional
ground,
would
that
the
open
to
the
court
of
claims?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
asking
you
but
your
theory,
theory
of
the
united
states.
is
it
the
theory
of
the
united
states
that
in
a
subsequent
suit
for
back
pay,
the
court
of
claims
should
be
precluded
from
enquiring
into
the
jurisdiction
of
the
military
courts
with
respect
to
the
person
and
the
offence
charged?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
seems
me
that's
different
a
question
though,
because
i'd
suppose
the
accused
says
alright
i
accept
this.
i
not
going
-–
i'm
not
interest
in
getting
and
setting
aside
the
conclusion
that
i
am
to
be
separated
from
the
service
or
whatever
it
may
be,
but
i
want
to
exhaust
my
remedies
provided
by
law.
i
want
to
resort
my
remedies
provided
by
law
for
the
recovery
of
back
pay.
and
then
it
files
an
action
in
the
court
of
claims.
i
take
it
now
that
your
position
is
that
regardless
of
the
alleged
effect
even
if
it's
a
jurisdictional
defect
and
the
military
tribunal's
position
of
the
united
states,
is
that
--
that
is
that
the
court
of
claims
is
precluded
from
going
into
that?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
weisl
had
article
76
never
been
passed
would
then
your
positions,
that
court
of
claims
had
no
jurisdiction
whatsoever?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
but
you're
assuming
all
of
this,
this
comes
under
article
76,
but
this
is
an
appellate
review
or
a
record
of
a
trial
provided
by
article
76.
and
that
therefore
because
if
it's
not
appellate
review
within
the
sense
of
article
--
in
which
that
phrase
is
used
in
article
76,
then
it
is
an
original
proceeding
in
the
court
of
claims
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
as
an
original
proceeding
in
the
court
of
claims,
i
suppose
there
are
different
standards
are
followed,
but
certainly
article
76
does
not
govern,
isn't
that
right?
if
you
assume
that
this
is
an
original
proceeding
and
not
appellate
review
in
the
court
of
claims,
does
article
76
apply?
justice
abe
fortas
to
me
that's
the
issue
here
and
it's
an
issue
that
turns
upon
the
precise
language
of
article
76.
justice
abe
fortas
coming
back
to
that,
what
does
that
mean
orders
publishing
the
proceedings
of
courts-martial
and
all
action
taken
pursuant
to
those
proceedings?
the
second
didn't
help
you
because
action
taken
pursuant
to
the
proceedings
here
was
discharge
of
these
men.
what
does
the
first
part
mean?
orders
publishing
the
proceedings
in
the
courts-martial.
justice
abe
fortas
the
matter
of
your,
the
matter
of
your
position
here
is
that
the
court
of
claims
has
no
function
with
respect
to
the
ascertain
of
claims
for
back
pay,
where
the
person
has
been
separated
from
service,
military
service
by
court
martial.
justice
abe
fortas
you
just
carve
that
out
of
the
clear
statutory
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
claims
wouldn't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
how
about
with,
are
there
any
similar
situations
that
would
arise
outside
of
the
court's
martial?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
--
for
example
under
the,
with
respect
to
civil
servants,
is
there
a
procedure
for
a
dismissal
and
is
there
a
statutory
provision
that
a
dismissal
shall
be
final
and
conclusive?
justice
abe
fortas
well
there
are
claims
for
back
pay
by
civilian
employees
who
claim
they've
been
unjustly
dismissed.
justice
abe
fortas
they
would
have
jurisdiction
but
they
can't
just
--
under
your
theory
they
can't
pass
on
constitutional
jurisdiction
or
evidentiary
issues,
so
i
don't
think
they
will
have
very
nice
time,
will
they?
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
the
difference
between
that
and
our
certiorari?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
no,
no.
i'm
talking
about
the
procedure
that
they
have
as
between
the
court
martial
and
themselves
however,
in
these
cases
where
it's
optional
with
that.
justice
abe
fortas
their
discretion.
justice
abe
fortas
ell,
but
your
client
is
only
right
to
go
the
court
of
appeals
is
one
conferred
by
the
congress
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
court
of
claims,
court
of
claims.
justice
abe
fortas
and
possibly
congress
could
circumscribe
that
right
in
various
ways
and
i
should
think
that
the
first
task
would
be
to
ascertain
whether
congress
intended
to
circumscribe
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
claims
in
the
way
that
mr.
weisl
has
argued.
justice
abe
fortas
then
if
you
find,
and
if
you
conclude
that
congress
did
intend
so
to
circumscribe
the
jurisdictional
court
of
claims
maybe
we
come
next
to
your
--
to
what
you're
making
as
a
constitutional
point.
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
agree
that
the
court
of
claims
could
not
properly
reevaluate
the
evidence?
justice
abe
fortas
then
unless,
unless
the
court
of
claim,
unless
it's
a
constitutional
claim
the
court
of
claims
could
not
arrive
in
a
different
judgment?
justice
abe
fortas
but
it's
not
every
mistake
as
to
law
that
is
a
constitutional
error
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
it
is
not
every
mistake
as
to
rule
of
law
committed
in
the
trial
of
a
case
that
amounts
to
constitutional
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
you
are
saying
here
is
there
were
so
many
mistakes
made
that
in
the
aggregate
they
amount
to
constitutional
error
is
that
your
point?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
sharlitt
suppose
the
court
of
military
appeals
that,
taken
this
case
instead
of
having
refused
to
review
it
and
had
heard
all
of
your
arguments
along
this
line
and
had
to
affirm
the
conviction
of
this
man
would
you
then,
would
the
court
of
claims
then
be
available
to
you?
justice
abe
fortas
was
it
put
to
him
in
just
that
language
that
you've
said,
where
in
the
record
--?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
he
wasn't
a
witness.
justice
abe
fortas
and
this
is
the
part
of
the
record
of
the
trial?
justice
abe
fortas
let
me
revert
just
a
moment,
i've,
i
want
to
know
if
you're
telling
us
precisely
what
you
said
and
i'm
looking
at
this
affidavit
and
it
says
subsequent
to
airman
hughes'
trial
and
prior
to
sergeant
juhl's
court-martial,
this
airman
was
advised
that
unless
he
agreed
to
appear
as
a
prosecution
witness
and
testify,
he
would
be
tried
by
a
general
court-martial
and
so
forth.
justice
abe
fortas
you
just
told
us
that
unless
he
testified
and
implicated
this
man
now
he
didn't
say
that
according
to
this
affidavit.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it
says
that
he
--
justice
abe
fortas
testified
for
the
prosecution.
justice
abe
fortas
but
does
that
imply
that
he
used
to
tell
anything
but
the
truth.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i'm
not
quarreling
with
that,
i
just
want,
i
just
--
calling
your
attention
to
what
you
said
and
what
the
affidavit
says.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
all,
that's
all
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
your
argument
otherwise
go
ahead
--.
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
is
a
daily
matter
for
the
enforcement
of
the
narcotic
laws
that
the
government
uses
narcotic
addiction
notoriously
irresponsible
and
untruthful,
will
have
a
string
of
convictions,
maybe
a
block
long.
doesn't
the
government
use
those
people
as
a
principle
witness
in
their
cases?
justice
abe
fortas
does
that
deprive
the
court
of
jurisdiction?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
other
evidence
besides
him
in
this
case?
justice
abe
fortas
nothing
that
would
corroborate
him?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
mean
that
the
court
of
military
appeals
had
no
jurisdiction?
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
because
of
the
minor,
the
minor
penalty
that
was
put
on
his
--
justice
abe
fortas
now
does
that
mean
that
every,
every
penalty
that,
in
the
armed
forces,
it
is
so
minor
that
it
cannot
get
to
the
court
of
military
appeals
has
a
right
to
go
direct
to
the
court
of
claims?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
suppose
and
following
up
the
question
i
ask
you
--
we
would
have
to
say,
if
we
agreed
with
you,
that
in
every
conviction,
military
conviction
where
the
punishment
was
so
small
that
it
could
not
be
reviewed
by
the
court
of
military
appeals
that
this
court
would
have
the
responsibility
of
eventually
reviewing
these
cases
just
on
the
record
of
the
military
trial.
justice
abe
fortas
what
brief
is
that
you
state
your
evidence?
justice
abe
fortas
this
brief?
justice
abe
fortas
here
it
is.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
steiner
you've
filed
more
than
a
memorandum
on
opposition,
didn't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
to
what
extent
must,
must
it
be
corroborated?
justice
abe
fortas
the
fact
they
were
contradicted
with
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
they
told
it?
justice
abe
fortas
who
said
the
cigars
--?
justice
abe
fortas
who
said
the
cigars
were
in
the
front
seat?
justice
abe
fortas
the
car
in
which
the
defendant
was
when
they
went
to
sell
this
--
justice
abe
fortas
now
why
isn't
that
that
corroboration?
justice
abe
fortas
well
and
then
say
it
in
the
statute
and
the
court
of
claims
have
never
done
it,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
it
doesn't
say
in
the
statute
and
the
court
of
claims
has
never
reviewed
that
sort
of
a
determination,
am
i
right
or
wrong?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
but
you
were
saying
court
of
claims
and
in
fact
of
the
matter
is
statute
does
not
mention
the
court
of
claims
and
the
court
of
claims
has
never
have
reviewed
it,
has
never
exercised
power
that
i
understood
you
to
assert
that
it
has.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
your
point
really
is
article
76
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice;
page
two
of
your
brief
should
be
read
to
mean
that
the
judgments
are
not
only
final
and
conclusive,
but
that
they
must
be
accepted
as
concluding
of
--
as
final
and
conclusive
in
a
subsequent
civil
suit.
justice
abe
fortas
so,
let
us
assume
mr.
weisl
that
all
of
the
proceedings
were
held
in
the
courts
of
military
justice
and
no
question
about
them.
your
position
has
to
be
that
when
the
defendant
in
the
criminal

or
whatever
it
is
called.
in
the
military

before
the
military

files
an
action
for
back

in
the
court
of

a
separate
jurisprudential

that
the

that

cannot
then
go

at

justice
abe
fortas
as
far
as
that
court

discovers
that
or
concludes
that
the
military
courts
and
no
jurisdiction.
and
that
therefore
over
the
offense
charge
and
that
therefore
the
soldier
was
wrongly
separated
from
the
service,
but
on
a
jurisdictional
ground,
would
that
the
open
to
the
court
of
claims?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
asking
you
but
your
theory,
theory
of
the
united
states.
is
it
the
theory
of
the
united
states
that
in
a
subsequent
suit
for
back
pay,
the
court
of
claims
should
be
precluded
from
enquiring
into
the
jurisdiction
of
the
military
courts
with
respect
to
the
person
and
the
offence
charged?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
seems
me
that's
different
a
question
though,
because
i'd
suppose
the
accused
says
alright
i
accept
this.
i
not
going
-–
i'm
not
interest
in
getting

setting

the

that
i

i
want
to
resort

provided

law
for
the
recovery
of
back
pay.
and
then
it
files
an
action
in
the
court
of
claims.
i
take
it
now
that
your
position
is
that
regardless
of
the
alleged
effect
even
if
it's
a
jurisdictional
defect
and
the
military
tribunal's
position
of
the
united
states,
is
that
--
that
is
that
the
court
of
claims
is
precluded
from
going
into
that?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
weisl
had
article
76
never
been
passed
would
then
your
positions,
that
court
of
claims
had
no
jurisdiction
whatsoever?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
but
you're
assuming
all
of
this,
this
comes
under
article
76,
but
this
is
an
appellate
review
or
a
record
of
a
trial
provided
by
article
76.
and
that
therefore
because
if
it's
not
appellate
review
within
the
sense
of
article
--
in
which
that
phrase
is
used
in
article
76,
then
it
is
an
original
proceeding
in
the
court
of
claims
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
as
an
original
proceeding
in
the
court
of
claims,
i
suppose
there
are
different
standards
are
followed,
but
certainly
article
76
does
not
govern,
isn't
that
right?
if
you
assume
that
this
is
an
original
proceeding
and
not
appellate
review
in
the
court
of
claims,
does
article
76
apply?
justice
abe
fortas
to
me
that's
the
issue
here
and
it's
an
issue
that
turns
upon
the
precise
language
of
article
76.
justice
abe
fortas
coming
back
to
that,
what
does
that
mean
orders
publishing
the
proceedings
of
courts-martial
and
all
action
taken
pursuant
to
those
proceedings?
the
second
didn't
help
you
because
action
taken
pursuant
to
the
proceedings
here
was
discharge
of
these
men.
what
does
the
first
part
mean?
orders
publishing
the
proceedings
in
the
courts-martial.
justice
abe
fortas
the
matter
of
your,
the

of
your

with
that.
justice
abe
fortas
their
discretion.
justice
abe
fortas
ell,
but
your
client
is
only
right
to
go
the
court
of
appeals
is
one
conferred
by
the
congress
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
court
of
claims,
court
of
claims.
justice
abe
fortas
and
possibly
congress
could
circumscribe
that
right
in
various
ways
and
i
should
think
that
the
first
task
would
be
to
ascertain
whether
congress
intended
to
circumscribe
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
claims
in
the
way
that
mr.
weisl
has
argued.
justice
abe
fortas
then
if
you
find,
and
if
you
conclude
that
congress
did
intend
so
to
circumscribe
the
jurisdictional
court
of
claims
maybe
we
come
next
to
your
--
to
what
you're
making
as
a
constitutional
point.
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
agree
that
the
court
of
claims
could
not
properly
reevaluate
the
evidence?
justice
abe
fortas
then
unless,
unless
the
court
of
claim,
unless
it's
a
constitutional
claim
the
court
of
claims
could
not
arrive
in
a
different
judgment?
justice
abe
fortas
but
it's
not
every
mistake
as
to
law
that
is
a
constitutional
error
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
it
is
not
every
mistake
as
to
rule
of
law
committed
in
the
trial
of
a
case
that
amounts
to
constitutional
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
you
are
saying
here
is
there
were
so
many
mistakes
made
that
in
the
aggregate
they
amount
to
constitutional
error
is
that
your
point?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
sharlitt
suppose
the
court
of
military
appeals
that,
taken
this
case
instead
of
having
refused
to
review
it
and
had
heard
all
of
your
arguments
along
this
line
and
had
to
affirm
the
conviction
of
this
man
would
you
then,
would
the
court
of
claims
then
be
available
to
you?
justice
abe
fortas
was
it
put
to
him
in
just
that
language
that
you've
said,
where
in
the
record
--?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
he
wasn't
a
witness.
justice
abe
fortas
and
this
is
the
part
of
the
record
of
the
trial?
justice
abe
fortas
let
me
revert
just
a
moment,
i've,
i
want
to
know
if
you're
telling
us
precisely
what
you
said
and
i'm
looking
at
this
affidavit
and
it
says
subsequent
to
airman
hughes'
trial
and
prior
to
sergeant
juhl's
court-martial,
this
airman
was
advised
that
unless
he
agreed
to
appear
as
a
prosecution
witness
and
testify,
he
would
be
tried
by
a
general
court-martial
and
so
forth.
justice
abe
fortas
you
just
told
us
that
unless
he
testified
and
implicated
this
man
now
he
didn't
say
that
according
to
this
affidavit.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it
says
that
he
--
justice
abe
fortas
testified
for
the
prosecution.
justice
abe
fortas
but
does
that
imply
that
he
used
to
tell
anything
but
the
truth.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i'm
not
quarreling
with
that,
i
just
want,
i
just
--
calling
your
attention
to
what
you
said
and
what
the
affidavit
says.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
all,
that's
all
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
your
argument
otherwise
go
ahead
--.
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
is
a
daily
matter
for
the
enforcement
of
the
narcotic
laws
that
the
government
uses
narcotic
addiction
notoriously
irresponsible
and
untruthful,
will
have
a
string
of
convictions,
maybe
a
block
long.
doesn't
the
government
use
those
people
as
a
principle
witness
in
their
cases?
justice
abe
fortas
does
that
deprive
the
court
of
jurisdiction?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
other
evidence
besides
him
in
this
case?
justice
abe
fortas
nothing
that
would
corroborate
him?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
mean
that
the
court
of
military
appeals
had
no
jurisdiction?
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
because
of
the
minor,
the
minor
penalty
that
was
put
on
his
--
justice
abe
fortas
now
does
that
mean
that
every,
every
penalty
that,
in
the
armed
forces,
it
is
so
minor
that
it
cannot
get
to
the
court
of
military
appeals
has
a
right
to
go
direct
to
the
court
of
claims?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
suppose
and
following
up
the
question
i
ask
you
--
we
would
have
to
say,
if
we
agreed
with
you,
that
in
every
conviction,
military
conviction
where
the
punishment
was
so
small
that
it
could
not
be
reviewed
by
the
court
of
military
appeals
that
this
court
would
have
the
responsibility
of
eventually
reviewing
these
cases
just
on
the
record
of
the
military
trial.
justice
abe
fortas
what
brief
is
that
you
state
your
evidence?
justice
abe
fortas
this
brief?
justice
abe
fortas
here
it
is.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
steiner
you've
filed
more
than
a
memorandum
on
opposition,
didn't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
to
what
extent
must,
must
it
be
corroborated?
justice
abe
fortas
the
fact
they
were
contradicted
with
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
they
told
it?
justice
abe
fortas
who
said
the
cigars
--?
justice
abe
fortas
who
said
the
cigars
were
in
the
front
seat?
justice
abe
fortas
the
car
in
which
the
defendant
was
when
they
went
to
sell
this
--
justice
abe
fortas
now
why
isn't
that
that
corroboration?
justice
abe
fortas
well
and
then
say
it
in
the
statute
and
the
court
of
claims
have
never
done
it,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
it
doesn't
say
in
the
statute
and
the
court
of
claims
has
never
reviewed
that
sort
of
a
determination,
am
i
right
or
wrong?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
but
you
were
saying
court
of
claims
and
in
fact
of
the
matter
is
statute
does
not
mention
the
court
of
claims
and
the
court
of
claims
has
never
have
reviewed
it,
has
never
exercised
power
that
i
understood
you
to
assert
that
it
has.
