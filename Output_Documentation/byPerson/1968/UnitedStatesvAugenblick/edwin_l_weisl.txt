mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
are
two
cases
here
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
claims.
in
each
of
them,
the
united
states
seeks
reversal
of
judgments
of
that
court
granting
back
pay
to
former
servicemen,
each
of
whom
had
been
discharged
from
the
service
pursuant
to
judgments
of
conviction
of
court-martials.
in
each
of
these
cases,
the
united
states
urges
that
the
court
of
claims
lacks
power
to
an
effect
constitute
itself
an
additional
appellate
tribunal
to
review
courts-martial
for
errors
of
law
and
therefore
their
judgment
should
be
reversed.
beyond
the
common
question
of
law,
neither
of
these
cases
has
anything
in
common.
in
augenblick,
we
have
a
conviction
of
a
naval
officer
for
an
indecent
--
commission
of
an
indecent
lewd
and
lascivious
act
and
juhl,
the
conviction
for
black
market
activities.
in
augenblick,
the
court
of
claims
in
effect
reversed
the
court-martial
conviction
and
granted
back
pay
because
of
a
purported
jencks
act
question.
in
juhl,
the
court
of
claims
purported
to
reverse
a
court-martial
conviction
and
award
back
pay,
because
of
a
question
of
a
conviction
of
juhl's
on
what
the
court
of
claims
said
was
self-contradictory,
uncorroborated,
accomplice
testimony.
in
other
words,
a
mere
evidentiary
question.
the
united
states
says
of
the
court
of
claims
lacks
to
power
to
do
this.
that
the
finality
provisions
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
providing
for
review
of
courts-martial
ultimately
by
the
court
of
military
appeals
bars
the
court
of
claims
from
reviewing
once
again
these
judgments
of
conviction
for
factual
jencks
act
questions
and
the
like.
but
that
even
if
this
court
finds
that
the
court
of
claims
has
some
measure
of
power
to
review
courts-martial,
no
matter
whether
that
power
be
broader
or
narrow,
the
court
of
claims
was
in
error
here.
augenblick
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
no
sir,
i
believe
their
only
power
is
to
reward
back
pay,
but
i
think
that
clearly
the
effect
is
to
reverse
the
conviction.
i'm
not
certain
whether
or
not
a
board
for
the
review
of
records,
military
records
would
then
reinstate
the
man
and
wipeout
the
conviction
utterly.
i
certainly
think
-–
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
they
were
both
dismissed
yes
sir.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
believe
that
each
service
now
has
a
board
for
the
correction
of
records
and
they
would
apply
to
that
board
citing
the
decision
of
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
do
not
sir
and
i
really
do
not
know
whether
this
is
ground.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
juhl
was
not
entitled
to
such
review,
because
this
conviction
was
for
less
then
six
months
or
was
for
six
months.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
it
is
discretionary
except
--
first
of
all,
it
can
only
review
convictions
in
which
sentences
of
a
year
or
more
then
awarded.
i
believe
that
as
mandatory
review
of
conviction
of
officers
of
flag
–
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes
it
was.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
it
was
discretionary.
they
have
a
certiorari
i
would
say
type
jurisdiction.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
fortas
and
i
wish
to
point
out
however
that
--
remember
we
are
dealing
with
back
pay
cases
and
not
with
habeas
corpus
situations.
of
course,
there
is
a
review
by
habeas
corpus
of
courts-martial.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
no,
augenblick
could
not
have
had
a
review
by
habeas
corpus,
juhl
could
have
he
did
serve
some
time.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes,
we
feel
that
he
was
finished
when
his
conviction
was
in
effect
upheld
by
the
court
of
military
appeals.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well,
their
denial
of
-–
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
no,
i
think
that
perhaps
i
failed
to
point
out
that
courts-martial
are
reviewed
even
if
they
do
not
ultimately
reach
the
court
of
military
appeals.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
within
the
services
indeed,
but
they
are
constituted
within
each
services,
boards
of
review
that
by
statute,
recent
statute
have
been
elevated
at
least
to
the
title
of
courts
of
military
review
or
appeal
consisting
of
judge
advocate
general
officers
and/or
civilians,
which
have
a
very
large
degree
of
independence
i
think
and
freedom
from
influence
by
the
command.
certainly,
when
you
think
that
the
purpose
of
courts-martial
are
disciplinary.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
juhl
case
again
because
of
the
shortness
of
the
conviction
did
not
reach
such
a
board,
but
it
was
reviewed
by
the
convening
authority
of
the
court
and
somewhat
–-
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes,
but
each
of
them
have
judge,
staff
judge
advocates
to
advice
them
on
questions
of
law
and
fact
that
may
be
relevant
and
i
think
there
has
been
a
high
degree
of
scrupulousness
to
protect
rights
of
defendants
in
these
courts-martial.
i
think
this
court
can
well
take
into
account
the
fact
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
that
is
my
position
and
in
augenblick,
i
say
this
is
not
a
harsh
one
because
the
court
of
military
appeals
could
have
presented
to
it
any
constitutional
issue
and
if
there
were
a
substantial
one,
i
submit
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i'm
sure
that
it
is
possible
this
court
and
that
–-
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
it
is
my
-–
i
believe
this
is
the
standard
conclusion,
we
suggest
in
our
brief
and
i'm
prepared
to
argue
that
at
times
a
broader
scope
of
review
has
been
considered
by
this
court
and
at
other
times
the
court
of
claims
has
assumed
that
power
without
having
an
appeal
taken
to
this
court.
there
is
no
need
for
–-
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
suggest
that
there
is
no
need
for
that.
the
question
that's
really
before
this
court.
your
honor
i
would
submit
that
the
court
should
hold
that
the
court
of
claims
need
not
in
fairness
to
accused
persons
have
that
jurisdiction
now.
i
will
say
that
they
have
exercised
it
though.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
it
is
our
theory,
it
is.
we
concede
however
that
the
court
of
claims
has
in
the
past,
without
being
challenged,
assumed
the
power
to
look
at
the
jurisdiction.
we
cite
in
point
two
of
our
brief,
a
couple
of
cases
where
they
did
that
very
thing,
they
realized
at
the
court
was
improperly
constituted,
didn't
have
the
proper
officers
sitting
on
it
and
then
they
granted
back
pay.
i
submit
though
with
what
congress
has
done
to
protect
the
accused
providing
i
think
a
very
elaborate
and
adequate
system
of
review,
there
is
no
need
for
the
court
of
claims
to
–-
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
what
we
really
feel
mr.
justice
fortas
is
that
there
is
a
statute,
congressional
act,
which
was
embodied
in
article
76
and
the
ucmj.
that
is
maybe
review
within
the
court
martial
military
system,
final
and
conclusive.
we
think
that
it
is
adequate
to
protect
defendants
against
improperly
constituted
tribunals,
therefore
the
court
of
claims
is
precluded
from
doing
this.
now
i
understand
the
court's
difficulty
and
problem
with
it,
but
i'm
sure
whether
one
is
really
tilting
at
windmills
these
days,
when
there
is
a
true
adequate
and
largely
civilian
reviewed
court
martial,
most
of
the
judge
advocate
officers
in
the
services
today,
this
court
well
knows
are
really
oriented
people
who
are
serving
brief
time
in
military
service,
in
order
to
satisfy
their
obligation,
they
are
jealous
guardians
of
the
rights
of
defendants.
court
of
military
appeals
record
of
reversal
not
convictions
is
astoundingly
high,
i
think
probably
higher
that
any
civilian
court
that
reviews
–-
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well
i
think
that's
an
important
distinction
that
we
have
habeas
preserved
where
the
–-
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yeah
but
it's
really
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
one,
being
deprived
of
one's
liberty
or
one's
life
to
which
habeas
also
attaches,
is
a
far
more
injurious
and
then
–-
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
absolutely
don't
appoint
the
two,
certainly
the
constitution
prohibits
any
suspension
of
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
except
at
time
of
war
where
it's
silent
about
suspension
of
the
right
of
an
action
for
back
pay,
one
way
or
the
other.
i
don't
think
you
can
really
equate
the
two
and
i
think
that
you've
got
also
to
realize
that
at
some
point
a
conviction
of
court
martial
must
be
final,
and
i
think
its
reasonable
to
say
that
when
congress,
again
i
think
is
jealously
considering
the
rights
of
defendants
and
setting
up
an
elaborate
system
of
review
has
considered
the
question
and
as
an
act
of
the
finality
clause
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well
i
think
at
all
times
there
has
been
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well
there
were
very
few
cases
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
the
couplet
returned
in
the
century
and
then
they
were
one
like
involving
a
world
war
ii
conviction
where
the
man
was
denied
right
to
counsel
that
was
not
taken
to
this
court.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
also
think
however
that
the
possibility
of
jurisdictional
defects
in
military
courts
is
far
less
then
i
think
we
may
be
talking
about
here
today.
i
can
conceive
of
a
civilian
being
improperly
tried,
of
course
that
may
happen,
but
i
think
this
court
has
laid
those
questions
to
rest
in
many
of
its
decisions.
i
think
it's
virtually
impossible,
if
not
utterly
impossible
having
an
improperly
constituted
court
because
it
is
all
laid
out
very
clearly
for
the
use
of
commanding
officers
who
were
generally
advised
by
judge
advocates
and
certainly
a
legal
review
of
patent
defect
of
that
character
would
ultimately
reach
a
trained
lawyer
who
would
be
able
to
advise
his
superior
that
such
a
court
martial
cannot
stand.
i
think,
if
you
look
at
what
the
court
of
claims
did
here
you
can
see
at
least
the
evils
in
giving
them
a
very
broad
scope
of
review.
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
facts,
each
of
these
cases
briefly
to
show
that
really
these
are
cases
in
which
this
court
has
injected
itself
into
the
appellate
proceedings
unnecessarily
and
i
think
even
under
the
broadest
review
improperly.
in
augenblick
for
example,
as
i
said
we
have
a
reported
jencks
act
question.
augenblick
was
accused
of
committing
an
natural
sex
act
with
one
airman
hodges
and
airman
hodges
was
interrogated
by
naval
intelligence
officers
and
purportedly
a
tape
recording
of
his
conversation
was
made.
when
it
came
for
trial,
his
tape
recording
had
disappeared.
contrary
to
what
i
think
respondent
augenblick's
brief
says,
a
very
full
and
adequate
hearing
was
afforded
at
the
court
martial
to
try
to
find
out
what
had
happened
to
that
tape.
the
government
voluntarily
produced
eight
witnesses,
each
of
whom
testified
before
the
court
martial
as
to
what
precisely
they
knew
about
the
tape,
leading
to
the
conclusion
that
if
one
had
been
made
and
it
probably
had,
one;
the
tape
recording
device
might
have
failed
because
in
an
other
time,
a
partially
garbled
transcript
was
obtained,
but
at
worst
the
tape
had
reached
an
opposite
naval
intelligence
investigator
who
had
by
accident
allowed
the
tape
to
be
erased
when
it
was
used
to
records
someone
else.
the
reason
that
this
tape
was
sought
supposedly
was
to
investigate
whether
an
alleged
promise
had
been
made
to
airman
hodges
that
if
he
testified
against
augenblick,
he
would
receive
an
honorable
discharge.
but
at
his
court
marital
his
own
defense
counsel
has
conceded
that
this
couldn't
have
happened
because
after
all
hodges
was
in
the
air
force
and
he
was
being
interrogated
by
naval
intelligence,
civilian
inspectors
and
even
an
airman
wouldn't
expect
that
a
navy
man
could
promise
him
an
honorable
discharge
from
his
own
service,
so
this
had
been
conceded
away.
and
moreover
we
had
a
case
of
harmless
error,
because
while
hodges
had
testified
to
the
indecent
act
actually
taking
place,
two
police
officers
had
seen
the
act,
but
at
seeing
something
related
to
it
which
was
well
not
the
act,
indecent
and
lascivious
conduct
and
the
court
convicted
him
only
of
the
indecent
and
lascivious
conduct,
not
of
actually
committing
the
unnatural
act.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
think
it
proposed
to
foreclose
the
study
of
the
--
further
review
of
the
issues
raised
in
the
court-martial
article
76
does
whether
you
deem
the
court
of
claims
acts
original
or
review
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
answering
the
question
which
mr.
justice
fortas
posed
just
before
the
lunch
recess,
which
i
understand
to
be
whether
article
76
applies
to
an
original
proceeding
in
the
court
of
claims
as
opposed
to
a
mere
appellate
review.
i
think
it
is
my
position
that
i
believe
article
76
was
designed
to
accomplish
the
foreclosure
of
further
proceedings
even
in
the
court
of
claims
by
way
of
original
suit.
the
second
sentence
of
article
76
which
i
would
like
to
read
to
the
court,
reads
as
follow.
orders
publishing
the
proceedings
of
court-martial
and
all
action
taken
pursuant
to
those
proceedings
are
binding
upon
all
departments,
courts,
agencies
and
officers
of
the
united
states
subject
only
to
action
upon
a
petition
for
a
new
trial
as
provided
in
article
73.
so
i
do
believe
that
indeed.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
was
reading
the
second
sentence
of
article
76
of
the
uniform
code,
that's
on
page
two
of
our
brief.
i
would
like
to
correct
a
mistake
that
i
believe
i
made
to
the
court
and
for
which
i
apologize.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
it
seems
to
me,
it
means
the
decisions
and
that
the
language
of
these
decisions
binds
the
courts
and
they
must
follow
them.
i
admit
it's
confusing
and
i
don't
believe
the
legislative
history
enlightens
us
further
on
this
particular
point
except
that
i
would
like
to
invite
the
court's
attention
to
one
statement
in
both
the
house
and
senate
reports
on
article
76
itself
in
which
they
say
that
--
of
article
76,
that
subject
only
to
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
federal
court.
article
76
provides
for
the
finality
of
court-martial
proceedings
and
judgements.
so
i
think
that
the
legislative
history
at
least
supports
the
construction
that
i
placed
upon
this
second
sentence.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
think
i
made
one
misstatement
that
i'd
like
to
correct,
then
i
believe
i
have
left
the
court
in
confusion
somewhat
as
to
the
scope
of
the
court
of
military
appeals
powers
of
review.
first
in
the
--
as
to
the
juhl
case,
i
stated
to
the
court
that
he
had
been
discharged
from
the
service.
this
in
fact
is
not
the
case,
he
had
been
reduced
in
rank
and
deprived
of
pay.
he
is
still
as
i
understand
a
member
of
the
military
service.
juhl
was
the
man
who
was
convicted
in
the
second
case
of
black
marketing.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
no
commander
augenblick
is
the
sexual
offense,
he
has
been
dismissed.
juhl,
who
was
the
enlisted
man
who
was
found
guilty
of
black
marketeering
was
merely
reduced
in
rate
and
fine.
and
this
of
course
brings
before
us
the
question
of
the
scope
of
the
court
of
military
appeals,
powers
of
review
and
it
has
the
power
to
review
courts-martial
when
there
is
a
sentence
in
excess
of
one
year
or
when
there
is
in
the
case
of
an
officer
dismissal
from
the
service
which
is
how
augenblick
got
at
least
to
the
point
where
they
decided
not
to
hear
it.
and
in
the
case
of
an
enlisted
man
if
he
gets
a
bad
conduct
or
dishonorable
discharge,
he
than
can
have
a
review
by
the
court
of
military
appeal.
furthermore
i
analogized
here
review
powers
to
certiorari
in
this
court.
i
believe
they
--
when
they
deny
a
review,
they're
in
effect
doing
a
bit
more
than
the
mere
denial
of
writ
of
certiorari
because
if
they
fail
to
find
good
cause
they
can
decline
to
review
it,
so
they
at
least
have
to
look
at
a
record
to
determine
whether
there
is
good
cause
shown
for
review,
which
i
believe
tends
to
be
a
stronger
action
than
the
mere
denial
of
a
writ
of
certiorari
by
this
court.
i
was,
at
the
close
on
my
argument
reviewing
briefly
the
facts
in
augenblick
to
show
you
what
the
court
of
claims
is
really
doing
here
and
i
stated
that
they
had
heard
eight
witnesses
to
determine
what
had
happened
to
these
tape
recordings
that
at
most
what
was
found
was
that
the
tape
had
been
inadvertently
re-used,
that
the
witness
hodges
really,
his
testimony
was
not
that
upon
which
augenblick
was
convicted,
but
rather
that
a
police
officer
so
even
if
the
defense
did
not
have
the
statement
of
hodges
and
even
if
the
statement
that
he
made
was
wholly
inconsistent
with
his
testimony
or
trial,
the
error
would
have
been
harmless.
further
a
board
of
review
heard
the
augenblick
case
on
the
jencks
act
question,
studied
it
thoroughly
and
issued
a
rather
lengthy
opinion,
a
dissenting
opinion
on
the
very
jencks
act
question.
and
yet
the
court
of
claims
elevated
this
whole
question
into
one
of
constitutionality
i
think,
which
is
how
they
justified
their
taking
of
the
case
at
all.
and
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
evils
of
giving
the
court
of
claims,
a
broad
scope
of
review
of
court-martial
because
they
just
go
ahead
to
go
into
these
facts,
they're
going
to
look
at
lengthy
records,
do
something
which
in
effect
the
defendant
and
the
court-martial
already
has
done
for
him
by
congressional
mandate
to
what
a
fair
chance
at
having
his
conviction
reversed
for
errors
of
the
type
that
was
present
in
augenblick.
juhl
is
an
even
more
striking
example
of
why
the
court
of
claim
should
be
kept
out
of
this
area,
i
believe.
in
juhl
the
question
was
whether
his
accomplice
was
the
sole
reason
he
was
convicted
and
if
so
whether
that
accomplice's
testimony
was
self
contradictory.
and
this
question
the
court
of
claims
in
its
own
opinion
elevated
to
one
of
jurisdiction
of
the
court-martial.
if
you
have
accomplice's
testimony
and
use
it
improperly
this
deprives
the
court-martial
jurisdiction,
is
the
way
the
court
of
claims
justified
its
action
in
juhl.
now
here's
what
happened,
hughes
was
the
accomplice
of
mr.
juhl
and
he
testified
that
together,
mr.
juhl
and
i
are
engaged
in
black
market
activities
by
buying
goods
from
a
px
and
we
were
privileged
to
do
it
in
england
and
selling
it
to
civilians
at
considerable
profit
to
ourselves.
other
witnesses
which,
i
would
think
any
civilian
court
would
conclude
were
corroborative,
testified
that
at
one
point
mr.
juhl
had
gone
into
the
px
and
bought
a
lot
of
extra
cigarettes
or
cigars.
another
witness
placed
mr.
juhl
at
the
scene
where
an
admitted
sale
by
hughes
of
black
market
cigars
to
civilian,
english
civilians
had
taken
place,
he
didn't
show
juhl
actually
participating
when
he
was
at
least
there,
which
i
certainly
would
suggest
his
corroboration.
and
the
wife
of
hughes
saw
mr.
--
wife
of
mr.
hughes
the
accomplish
saw
defendant
juhl
at
one
point
coming
out
of
a
building
with
a
large
roll
of
english
currency,
after
a
black
market
transaction
had
apparently
taken
place.
the
court
of
claims
not
only
looked
at
the
accomplice
testimony
and
said
it
was
self
contradictory
and
uncorroborated,
but
they
said
that
this
was
jurisdictional.
why
was
it
jurisdictional,
because
it
--
somewhat
it
seemed
fit
to
have
a
separate
chapter
in
the
rules
relating
to
accomplice
testimony
and
they
--
from
this,
they
concluded
that
it
was
thought
so
important
the
accomplice
testimony
was
that
if
you
don't
properly
charge
it,
you
can't
base
a
conviction
on
and
it's
jurisdictional
a
bootstrap
argument
if
i
ever
had
one.
i
might
add
also
that
in
juhl
we
had
an
actual
waiver
of
an
instruction
on
accomplice
testimony,
which
was
offered
to
the
defense
because
the
defense
counsel,
when
the
law
officer
of
the
general
court-martial
said,
“do
you
want
an
instruction
on
accomplice
testimony?”
replied,
“no,
i
don't.
it's
not
the
theory
of
our
defense,
it's
not
important
to
our
defense.”
that's
why
i
submit
to
this
court
that
our
position
which
may
seem
to
be
a
harsh
one
that
even
for
a
lack
of
jurisdiction
in
the
court-martial,
the
court
of
claims
is
foreclosed
from
review,
is
not
as
harsh
as
it
may
sound.
because
of
the
provisions
for
adequate
review
of
these
court-martial
on
the
part
with
civilian
lawyers
when
anything,
really
damaging
to
a
defendant
takes
place,
lengthy
imprisonment,
dismissal,
dishonorable
discharge,
bad
conduct
discharge,
he
is
protected,
i
submit.
congress
has
seen
to
it
that
he
is
protected.
secondly,
if
the
court
of
claims
is
going
to
assume
jurisdiction
of
these
cases
and
elevate
the
very
close,
i
don't
even
think
it's
close
jencks
act
question
in
augenblick
to
a
constitutional
question
of
the
first
magnitude
or
take
accomplice
testimony
of
a
simple
question
where
i
think
the
court
of
claims
was
clearly
wrong
and
was
even
waived
by
the
defendant
and
say
this
is
a
jurisdictional
defect
in
the
court-martial,
you
are
going
to
have
every
single
court-martial
that
results
in
affirmance
by
at
any
point
in
the
line
brought
to
the
court
of
claims
and
one
final
effort
for
one
final
reversal.
this
is
something
that
is
contrary
to
good
sense.
i
think
it's
contrary
to
discipline
in
the
services
and
it's
not
necessary
for
the
protection
of
accused
persons,
habeas
corpus
exists
in
the
really
serious
situation.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
none
whatsoever
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
no
question
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
no
mr.
chief
justice.
now
i
say
that
if
this
court
were
to
find
that
there
is
a
limited
scope
of
review
in
the
part
of
the
court
of
claims,
it
should
fight
at
most,
that
there
is
a
right
to
review
in
respect
to
whether
the
court-martial
had
jurisdiction
of
the
person
of
the
subject
matter.
answering
an
earlier
question
mr.
justice
harlan
as
to
whether
if
article
76
did
not
exist,
would
we
be
taking
this
position
here
in
court?
the
answer
is
no,
that
the
court
of
claims
had
purported
to
exercise
the
power
to
review
courts-martial
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
in
the
past
and
i
would
concede
that
absent
article
76
today.
once
again,
i
believe
this
would
be
a
very
limited
effect
because
of
the
rarity
of
a
properly
constituted
courts-martial
because
for
any
type
of
offense
today,
legal
advice
is
available
to
the
convening
authority
can
pose
the
court
on
the
rules
for
how
to
constitute
court-martial
are
very
clearly
laid
out,
and
having
dealt
with
them
in
my
military
career
before
i
had
gone
through
a
last
couple
of
events,
so
that
a
layman
can
understand.
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
need
for
this
court
to
expand
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
claims
even
to
areas
where
on
habeas
corpus
of
district
court
could
review
a
court-martial
that
is
for
in
addition
to
jurisdiction,
constitutional
defect.
once
again
in
order
to
bootstrap
itself
into
giving
augenblick
and
juhl
back
pay,
the
court
of
claims
elevated
these
rather
elementary
and,
questions
of
certainly
not
constitutional
law
into
constitutional
questions
in
order
to
--
for
reasons
of
its
own
grant
pay
to
these
men.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
for
back
pay,
no
sir.
he
could
however
go
to
these
boards
for
the
correction
of
records
to
try
and
have
his
conviction
expunge,
which
would
give
him
the
right
to
the
back
pay.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
why?
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
it's
an
action
for
back
pay.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
that's
correct.
i
believe.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
tucker
act
case
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
no
sir,
except
i
would
say
that
in
the
sense
that
it
reviews
convictions
that,
in
my
mind
lacks
the
expertise
of
a
district
court
in
looking
into
these
matters
and
i
think
the
decisions
in
both
of
these
cases
illustrate
that
lack
of
expertise
very
well,
because
as
i
say
in
elevating
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
oh,
no
i
say
this
is
final
as
to
any
court
expect
in
habeas
corpus
situation
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
we've
taken
that
position
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
would
say
this
--
that
one
of
the
reasons
that
let
us,
and
led
me
to
make
this
argument
here
is
that
it
isn't
harsh
as
it
seems
and
i
think
pointed
out
why
it
isn't
to
the
extent
that
this
court
feels
if
our
position
is
harsh
and
is
unfair
to
people,
i
would
certainly
not
walk
out
of
this
court
room
feeling
that
the
government
has
been
done
a
disservice
if
the
court
would
hold
otherwise.
i
do
feel
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
give
the
court
of
claims
this
kind
of
power
in
order
to
protect
defendants
in
military
court.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
that
is
our
position,
but
let
me
add
one
warning
note
to
the
assumption
by
the
court
of
claims
the
power
to
decide
question
of
jurisdiction.
remember
that
in
each
of
these
cases
it
did
try
to
elevate
these
questions
into
jurisdictional
ones
and
constitutional
ones
the
only
review
of
the
court
of
claims
is
in
this
court,
does
that
mean
that
the
government
--
in
cases
such
as
these
where
they
were
clearly
wrong,
will
have
to
be
coming
to
the
supreme
court
on
rather
simple
elementary
criminal
law
questions
that
the
court
of
claims
has
demonstrated
it
lacks
expertise
on
and
their
decision
in
this
case
i
think
clearly
shows
it.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
the
language
of
article
76
together
with
the
statement
from
the
house
and
senate
reports
that
i
read
to
the
court
about
finality
indicates
that
they
did
not
consider
shapiro
or
intended
to
overrule,
and
they
did
at
one
point
say
that
the
article
76
or
the
whole
was
a
quantification,
i
don't
agree
that
shapiro
was
written
into
the
law,
it
may
have
been
but
i
just
do
not
feel
that
that
was
a
case.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
shapiro
case
was
--
it's
amusing
enough
to
recite
it
like
that,
i
think
shapiro
was
a
defendant,
a
man
at
a
court-martial,
and
the
way
he
had
done
it
was
by
substituting
one
mexican
american
for
another
and
the
rape
victim
and
everyone
else
identified
the
imposter
as
the
actual
defendant.
the
defendant
in
that
case
was
acquitted
with
so
enraged
shapiro
superiors
that
they
ordered
him
tried
for
obstructing
justice
and
they
gave
him
a
half
hour
to
prepare.
he
asked
for
counsel,
and
counsel
asked
for
time
to
prepare,
and
they
denied
it
and
they
held
in
effect
he
had
deprived
his
right
to
counsel
that
under
johnson
and
zerbst
in
effect
that
they
are
not
having
counsel
at
the
trial,
deprived
the
court
of
jurisdiction
and
therefore
they
gave
him
his
pay.
obviously,
the
government
didn't
choose
to
try
to
take
shapiro
of
this
court.
i
don't
think
the
failure
to
appeal
that
case
can
be
used
an
inference
that
we
acquiescent
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes
sir.
with
the
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i've
tried
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
know
of
none
mr.
justice
fortas,
on
the
other
hand
i
don't
--
where
the
dismissals
have
been
reviewed
in
the
appellate
courts
i
do
not
know
of
any
case
where
they've
then
gone
to
the
court
of
claims
and
sought
back
pay.
again
i'm
not
able
adequately
to
answer
your
question.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
know
of
no
statute
that
would
prevent
them
from
going
to
the
court
of
claims,
despite
the
fact
that
their
dismal
had
been
reviewed
by
the
courts
of
appeal
and
the
courts
of
claims.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well
they
have
jurisdiction
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
that's
correct
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes,
but
as
stated
by
you
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
think
the
consequences
of
these
defendants
are
much
harsher
than
they
really
are.
i
agree
with
you
though,
that
is
our
position.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
which
i
trust
i
will
get.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
very
briefly
chief
justice
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
don't
believe
it
was
mr.
justice
douglas,
the
speaker
as
to
the
board
question
that
has
been
the
subject
to
extensive
examination
by
the
court
--
there
is
a
discussion
in
our
brief
of
footnote
31
on
page
46.
in
this
brief,
our
position
that
legislative
history
of
the
statute
establishing
the
court
provides
that
there
maybe
judicial
review
under
appropriate
circumstances.
the
government
i
feel
certainly
would
take
the
position
that
if
the
underlying
action
being
reviewed
by
the
board
was
a
court-martial
that
the
finality
clause
of
article
76
would
bar
judicial
review
of
the
board's
decision.
the
board's
decision
however
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
think
that
case
is
clearly
wrong
to
the
extent
that
it
says
if
you
can
review
a
board.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
you'll
see
it
from
the
court
of
claims
decision
in
juhl
that
there
are
two
questions
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
there
was
not
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
here
no,
but
i
said
if
the
question
arose
again
whether
the
board
for
the
correction
of
records
could
be
reviewed
in
court
when
they
have
corrected
a
court-martial,
we
would
urge
that
article
76
bars
judicial
review
of
that
board
ashe.
yeah,
finally
in
conclusion
i
would
like
to
i
think
place
this
case
in
respect
to
both
these
cases
by
saying
that
i
think
we
are
all
concerned
about
probably
is
whether
a
military
defendant
has
access
at
some
point
to
a
civilian
court
to
make
sure
that
he
was
not
convicted
on
fundamentally
unfair
grounds
by
fundamentally
unfair
procedures
and
briefly
these
are
the
instances
under
which
a
military
defendant
can
at
some
point
get
civilian
review
by
a
civilian
court.
he
is
imprisoned
over
one
year;
he
can
go
to
the
court
of
military
appeals
or
of
course
habeas
corpus.
he
is
dismissed
from
the
service
as
was
augenblick;
it's
a
bad
conduct
or
dishonorable
discharge.
he
is
an
enlisted
man;
he
can
go
to
the
court
of
military
appeals,
which
is
a
civilian
court.
if
he
is
imprisoned
for
less
than
one
year,
truly
must
act
promptly,
but
he
can
seek
the
remedy
of
habeas
corpus
and
that
remedy
has
been
made
much
more
meaningful
by
this
court,
because
even
if
he
has
properly
applied
for
that
writ,
even
though
his
imprisonment
is
over
and
he
has
served
his
term,
this
court
has
recently
held
in
the
carafus
v.
lavallee
case
that
he
can
pursue
his
habeas
remedy
and
have
his
conviction
expunged.
therefore,
only
in
the
petty
area
where
a
fine
is
imposed
or
a
reduction
in
pay
takes
place
is
he
foreclosed
by
review
by
habeas
or
the
court
of
military
appeals.
i
think
that
this
situation
shows
that
fundamentally
the
position
the
government
has
urged
is
fair,
thank
you.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
are
two
cases
here
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
claims.
in
each
of
them,
the
united
states
seeks
reversal
of
judgments
of
that
court
granting
back
pay
to
former
servicemen,
each
of
whom
had
been
discharged
from
the
service
pursuant
to
judgments
of
conviction
of
court-martials.
in
each
of
these
cases,
the
united
states
urges
that
the
court
of
claims
lacks
power
to
an
effect
constitute
itself
an
additional
appellate
tribunal
to
review
courts-martial
for
errors
of
law
and
therefore
their
judgment
should
be
reversed.
beyond
the
common
question
of
law,
neither
of
these
cases
has
anything
in
common.
in
augenblick,
we
have
a
conviction
of
a
naval
officer
for
an
indecent
--
commission
of
an
indecent
lewd
and
lascivious
act
and
juhl,
the
conviction
for
black
market
activities.
in
augenblick,
the
court
of
claims
in
effect
reversed
the
court-martial
conviction
and
granted
back
pay
because
of
a
purported
jencks
act
question.
in
juhl,
the
court
of
claims
purported
to
reverse
a
court-martial
conviction
and
award
back
pay,
because
of
a
question
of
a
conviction
of
juhl's
on
what
the
court
of
claims
said
was
self-contradictory,
uncorroborated,
accomplice
testimony.
in
other
words,
a
mere
evidentiary
question.
the
united
states
says
of
the
court
of
claims
lacks
to
power
to
do
this.
that
the
finality
provisions
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
providing
for
review
of
courts-martial
ultimately
by
the
court
of
military
appeals
bars
the
court
of
claims
from
reviewing
once
again
these
judgments
of
conviction
for
factual
jencks
act
questions
and
the
like.
but
that
even
if
this
court
finds
that
the
court
of
claims
has
some
measure
of
power
to
review
courts-martial,
no
matter
whether
that
power
be
broader
or
narrow,
the
court
of
claims
was
in
error
here.
augenblick
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
no
sir,
i
believe
their
only
power
is
to
reward
back
pay,
but
i
think
that
clearly
the
effect
is
to
reverse
the
conviction.
i'm
not
certain
whether
or
not
a
board
for
the
review
of
records,
military
records
would
then
reinstate
the
man
and
wipeout
the
conviction
utterly.
i
certainly
think
-–
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
they
were
both
dismissed
yes
sir.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
believe
that
each
service
now
has
a
board
for
the
correction
of
records
and
they
would
apply
to
that
board
citing
the
decision
of
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
do
not
sir
and
i
really
do
not
know
whether
this
is
ground.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
juhl
was
not
entitled
to
such
review,
because
this
conviction
was
for
less
then
six
months
or
was
for
six
months.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
it
is
discretionary
except
--
first
of
all,
it
can
only
review
convictions
in
which
sentences
of
a
year
or
more
then
awarded.
i
believe
that
as
mandatory
review
of
conviction
of
officers
of
flag
–
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes
it
was.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
it
was
discretionary.
they
have
a
certiorari
i
would
say
type
jurisdiction.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
fortas
and
i
wish
to
point
out
however
that
--
remember
we
are
dealing
with
back
pay
cases
and
not
with
habeas
corpus
situations.
of
course,
there
is
a
review
by
habeas
corpus
of
courts-martial.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
no,
augenblick
could
not
have
had
a
review
by
habeas
corpus,
juhl
could
have
he
did
serve
some
time.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes,
we
feel
that
he
was
finished
when
his
conviction
was
in
effect
upheld
by
the
court
of
military
appeals.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well,
their
denial
of
-–
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
no,
i
think
that
perhaps
i
failed
to
point
out
that
courts-martial
are
reviewed
even
if
they
do
not
ultimately
reach
the
court
of
military
appeals.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
within
the
services
indeed,
but
they
are
constituted
within
each
services,
boards
of
review
that
by
statute,
recent
statute
have
been
elevated
at
least
to
the
title
of
courts
of
military
review
or
appeal
consisting
of
judge
advocate
general
officers
and/or
civilians,
which
have
a
very
large
degree
of
independence
i
think
and
freedom
from
influence
by
the
command.
certainly,
when
you
think
that
the
purpose
of
courts-martial
are
disciplinary.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
juhl
case
again
because
of
the
shortness
of
the
conviction
did
not
reach
such
a
board,
but
it
was
reviewed
by
the
convening
authority
of
the
court
and
somewhat
–-
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes,
but
each
of
them
have
judge,
staff
judge
advocates
to
advice
them
on
questions
of
law
and
fact
that
may
be
relevant
and
i
think
there
has
been
a
high
degree
of
scrupulousness
to
protect
rights
of
defendants
in
these
courts-martial.
i
think
this
court
can
well
take
into
account
the
fact
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
that
is
my
position
and
in
augenblick,
i
say
this
is
not
a
harsh
one
because
the
court
of
military
appeals
could
have
presented
to
it
any
constitutional
issue
and
if
there
were
a
substantial
one,
i
submit
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i'm
sure
that
it
is
possible
this
court
and
that
–-
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
it
is
my
-–
i
believe
this
is
the
standard
conclusion,
we
suggest
in
our
brief
and
i'm
prepared
to
argue
that
at
times
a
broader
scope
of
review
has
been
considered
by
this
court
and
at
other
times
the
court
of
claims
has
assumed
that
power
without
having
an
appeal
taken
to
this
court.
there
is
no
need
for
–-
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
suggest
that
there
is
no
need
for
that.
the
question
that's
really
before
this
court.
your
honor
i
would
submit
that
the
court
should
hold
that
the
court
of
claims
need
not
in
fairness
to
accused
persons
have
that
jurisdiction
now.
i
will
say
that
they
have
exercised
it
though.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
it
is
our
theory,
it
is.
we
concede
however
that
the
court
of
claims
has
in
the
past,
without
being
challenged,
assumed
the
power
to
look
at
the
jurisdiction.
we
cite
in
point
two
of
our
brief,
a
couple
of
cases
where
they
did
that
very
thing,
they
realized
at
the
court
was
improperly
constituted,
didn't
have
the
proper
officers
sitting
on
it
and
then
they
granted
back
pay.
i
submit
though
with
what
congress
has
done
to
protect
the
accused
providing
i
think
a
very
elaborate
and
adequate
system
of
review,
there
is
no
need
for
the
court
of
claims
to
–-
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
what
we
really
feel
mr.
justice
fortas
is
that
there
is
a
statute,
congressional
act,
which
was
embodied
in
article
76
and
the
ucmj.
that
is
maybe
review
within
the
court
martial
military
system,
final
and
conclusive.
we
think
that
it
is
adequate
to
protect
defendants
against
improperly
constituted
tribunals,
therefore
the
court
of
claims
is
precluded
from
doing
this.
now
i
understand
the
court's
difficulty
and
problem
with
it,
but
i'm
sure
whether
one
is
really
tilting
at
windmills
these
days,
when
there
is
a
true
adequate
and
largely
civilian
reviewed
court
martial,
most
of
the
judge
advocate
officers
in
the
services
today,
this
court
well
knows
are
really
oriented
people
who
are
serving
brief
time
in
military
service,
in
order
to
satisfy
their
obligation,
they
are
jealous
guardians
of
the
rights
of
defendants.
court
of
military
appeals
record
of
reversal
not
convictions
is
astoundingly
high,
i
think
probably
higher
that
any
civilian
court
that
reviews
–-
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well
i
think
that's
an
important
distinction
that
we
have
habeas
preserved
where
the
–-
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yeah
but
it's
really
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
one,
being
deprived
of
one's
liberty
or
one's
life
to
which
habeas
also
attaches,
is
a
far
more
injurious
and
then
–-
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
absolutely
don't
appoint
the
two,
certainly
the
constitution
prohibits
any
suspension
of
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
except
at
time
of
war
where
it's
silent
about
suspension
of
the
right
of
an
action
for
back
pay,
one
way
or
the
other.
i
don't
think
you
can
really
equate
the
two
and
i
think
that
you've
got
also
to
realize
that
at
some
point
a
conviction
of
court
martial
must
be
final,
and
i
think
its
reasonable
to
say
that
when
congress,
again
i
think
is
jealously
considering
the
rights
of
defendants
and
setting
up
an
elaborate
system
of
review
has
considered
the
question
and
as
an
act
of
the
finality
clause
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well
i
think
at
all
times
there
has
been
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well
there
were
very
few
cases
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
the
couplet
returned
in
the
century
and
then
they
were
one
like
involving
a
world
war
ii
conviction
where
the
man
was
denied
right
to
counsel
that
was
not
taken
to
this
court.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
also
think
however
that
the
possibility
of
jurisdictional
defects
in
military
courts
is
far
less
then
i
think
we
may
be
talking
about
here
today.
i
can
conceive
of
a
civilian
being
improperly
tried,
of
course
that
may
happen,
but
i
think
this
court
has
laid
those
questions
to
rest
in
many
of
its
decisions.
i
think
it's
virtually
impossible,
if
not
utterly
impossible
having
an
improperly
constituted
court
because
it
is
all
laid
out
very
clearly
for
the
use
of
commanding
officers
who
were
generally
advised
by
judge
advocates
and
certainly
a
legal
review
of
patent
defect
of
that
character
would
ultimately
reach
a
trained
lawyer
who
would
be
able
to
advise
his
superior
that
such
a
court
martial
cannot
stand.
i
think,
if
you
look
at
what
the
court
of
claims
did
here
you
can
see
at
least
the
evils
in
giving
them
a
very
broad
scope
of
review.
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
facts,
each
of
these
cases
briefly
to
show
that
really
these
are
cases
in
which
this
court
has
injected
itself
into
the
appellate
proceedings
unnecessarily
and
i
think
even
under
the
broadest
review
improperly.
in
augenblick
for
example,
as
i
said
we
have
a
reported
jencks
act
question.
augenblick
was
accused
of
committing
an
natural
sex
act
with
one
airman
hodges
and
airman
hodges
was
interrogated
by
naval
intelligence
officers
and
purportedly
a
tape
recording
of
his
conversation
was
made.
when
it
came
for
trial,
his
tape
recording
had
disappeared.
contrary
to
what
i
think
respondent
augenblick's
brief
says,
a
very
full
and
adequate
hearing
was
afforded
at
the
court
martial
to
try
to
find
out
what
had
happened
to
that
tape.
the
government
voluntarily
produced
eight
witnesses,
each
of
whom
testified
before
the
court
martial
as
to
what
precisely
they
knew
about
the
tape,
leading
to
the
conclusion
that
if
one
had
been
made
and
it
probably
had,
one;
the
tape
recording
device
might
have
failed
because
in
an
other
time,
a
partially
garbled
transcript
was
obtained,
but
at
worst
the
tape
had
reached
an
opposite
naval
intelligence
investigator
who
had
by
accident
allowed
the
tape
to
be
erased
when
it
was
used
to
records
someone
else.
the
reason
that
this
tape
was
sought
supposedly
was
to
investigate
whether
an
alleged
promise
had
been
made
to
airman
hodges
that
if
he
testified
against
augenblick,
he
would
receive
an
honorable
discharge.
but
at
his
court
marital
his
own
defense
counsel
has
conceded
that
this
couldn't
have
happened
because
after
all
hodges
was
in
the
air
force
and
he
was
being
interrogated
by
naval
intelligence,
civilian
inspectors
and
even
an
airman
wouldn't
expect
that
a
navy
man
could
promise
him
an
honorable
discharge
from
his
own
service,
so
this
had
been
conceded
away.
and
moreover
we
had
a
case
of
harmless
error,
because
while
hodges
had
testified
to
the
indecent
act
actually
taking
place,
two
police
officers
had
seen
the
act,
but
at
seeing
something
related
to
it
which
was
well
not
the
act,
indecent
and
lascivious
conduct
and
the
court
convicted
him
only
of
the
indecent
and
lascivious
conduct,
not
of
actually
committing
the
unnatural
act.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
think
it
proposed
to
foreclose
the
study
of
the
--
further
review
of
the
issues
raised
in
the
court-martial
article
76
does
whether
you
deem
the
court
of
claims
acts
original
or
review
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
answering
the
question
which
mr.
justice
fortas
posed
just
before
the
lunch
recess,
which
i
understand
to
be
whether
article
76
applies
to
an
original
proceeding
in
the
court
of
claims
as
opposed
to
a
mere
appellate
review.
i
think
it
is
my
position
that
i
believe
article
76
was
designed
to
accomplish
the
foreclosure
of
further
proceedings
even
in
the
court
of
claims
by
way
of
original
suit.
the
second
sentence
of
article
76
which
i
would
like
to
read
to
the
court,
reads
as
follow.
orders
publishing
the
proceedings
of
court-martial
and
all
action
taken
pursuant
to
those
proceedings
are
binding
upon
all
departments,
courts,
agencies
and
officers
of
the
united
states
subject
only
to
action
upon
a
petition
for
a
new
trial
as
provided
in
article
73.
so
i
do
believe
that
indeed.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
was
reading
the
second
sentence
of
article
76
of
the
uniform
code,
that's
on
page
two
of
our
brief.
i
would
like
to
correct
a
mistake
that
i
believe
i
made
to
the
court
and
for
which
i
apologize.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
it
seems
to
me,
it
means
the
decisions
and
that
the
language
of
these
decisions
binds
the
courts
and
they
must
follow
them.
i
admit
it's
confusing
and
i
don't
believe
the
legislative
history
enlightens
us
further
on
this
particular
point
except
that
i
would
like
to
invite
the
court's
attention
to
one
statement
in
both
the
house
and
senate
reports
on
article
76
itself
in
which
they
say
that
--
of
article
76,
that
subject
only
to
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
federal
court.
article
76
provides
for
the
finality
of
court-martial
proceedings
and
judgements.
so
i
think
that
the
legislative
history
at
least
supports
the
construction
that
i
placed
upon
this
second
sentence.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
think
i
made
one
misstatement
that
i'd
like
to
correct,
then
i
believe
i
have
left
the
court
in
confusion
somewhat
as
to
the
scope
of
the
court
of
military
appeals
powers
of
review.
first
in
the
--
as
to
the
juhl
case,
i
stated
to
the
court
that
he
had
been
discharged
from
the
service.
this
in
fact
is
not
the
case,
he
had
been
reduced
in
rank
and
deprived
of
pay.
he
is
still
as
i
understand
a
member
of
the
military
service.
juhl
was
the
man
who
was
convicted
in
the
second
case
of
black
marketing.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
no
commander
augenblick
is
the
sexual
offense,
he
has
been
dismissed.
juhl,
who
was
the
enlisted
man
who
was
found
guilty
of
black
marketeering
was
merely
reduced
in
rate
and
fine.
and
this
of
course
brings
before
us
the
question
of
the
scope
of
the
court
of
military
appeals,
powers
of
review
and
it
has
the
power
to
review
courts-martial
when
there
is
a
sentence
in
excess
of
one
year
or
when
there
is
in
the
case
of
an
officer
dismissal
from
the
service
which
is
how
augenblick
got
at
least
to
the
point
where
they
decided
not
to
hear
it.
and
in
the
case
of
an
enlisted
man
if
he
gets
a
bad
conduct
or
dishonorable
discharge,
he
than
can
have
a
review
by
the
court
of
military
appeal.
furthermore
i
analogized
here
review
powers
to
certiorari
in
this
court.
i
believe
they
--
when
they
deny
a
review,
they're
in
effect
doing
a
bit
more
than
the
mere
denial
of
writ
of
certiorari
because
if
they
fail
to
find
good
cause
they
can
decline
to
review
it,
so
they
at
least
have
to
look
at
a
record
to
determine
whether
there
is
good
cause
shown
for
review,
which
i
believe
tends
to
be
a
stronger
action
than
the
mere
denial
of
a
writ
of
certiorari
by
this
court.
i
was,
at
the
close
on
my
argument
reviewing
briefly
the
facts
in
augenblick
to
show
you
what
the
court
of
claims
is
really
doing
here
and
i
stated
that
they
had
heard
eight
witnesses
to
determine
what
had
happened
to
these
tape
recordings
that
at
most
what
was
found
was
that
the
tape
had
been
inadvertently
re-used,
that
the
witness
hodges
really,
his
testimony
was
not
that
upon
which
augenblick
was
convicted,
but
rather
that
a
police
officer
so
even
if
the
defense
did
not
have
the
statement
of
hodges
and
even
if
the
statement
that
he
made
was
wholly
inconsistent
with
his
testimony
or
trial,
the
error
would
have
been
harmless.
further
a
board
of
review
heard
the
augenblick
case
on
the
jencks
act
question,
studied
it
thoroughly
and
issued
a
rather
lengthy
opinion,
a
dissenting
opinion
on
the
very
jencks
act
question.
and
yet
the
court
of
claims
elevated
this
whole
question
into
one
of
constitutionality
i
think,
which
is
how
they
justified
their
taking
of
the
case
at
all.
and
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
evils
of
giving
the
court
of
claims,
a
broad
scope
of
review
of
court-martial
because
they
just
go
ahead
to
go
into
these
facts,
they're
going
to
look
at
lengthy
records,
do
something
which
in
effect
the
defendant
and
the
court-martial
already
has
done
for
him
by
congressional
mandate
to
what
a
fair
chance
at
having
his
conviction
reversed
for
errors
of
the
type
that
was
present
in
augenblick.
juhl
is
an
even
more
striking
example
of
why
the
court
of
claim
should
be
kept
out
of
this
area,
i
believe.
in
juhl
the
question
was
whether
his
accomplice
was
the
sole
reason
he
was
convicted
and
if
so
whether
that
accomplice's
testimony
was
self
contradictory.
and
this
question
the
court
of
claims
in
its
own
opinion
elevated
to
one
of
jurisdiction
of
the
court-martial.
if
you
have
accomplice's
testimony
and
use
it
improperly
this
deprives
the
court-martial
jurisdiction,
is
the
way
the
court
of
claims
justified
its
action
in
juhl.
now
here's
what
happened,
hughes
was
the
accomplice
of
mr.
juhl
and
he
testified
that
together,
mr.
juhl
and
i
are
engaged
in
black
market
activities
by
buying
goods
from
a
px
and
we
were
privileged
to
do
it
in
england
and
selling
it
to
civilians
at
considerable
profit
to
ourselves.
other
witnesses
which,
i
would
think
any
civilian
court
would
conclude
were
corroborative,
testified
that
at
one
point
mr.
juhl
had
gone
into
the
px
and
bought
a
lot
of
extra
cigarettes
or
cigars.
another
witness
placed
mr.
juhl
at
the
scene
where
an
admitted
sale
by
hughes
of
black
market
cigars
to
civilian,
english
civilians
had
taken
place,
he
didn't
show
juhl
actually
participating
when
he
was
at
least
there,
which
i
certainly
would
suggest
his
corroboration.
and
the
wife
of
hughes
saw
mr.
--
wife
of
mr.
hughes
the
accomplish
saw
defendant
juhl
at
one
point
coming
out
of
a
building
with
a
large
roll
of
english
currency,
after
a
black
market
transaction
had
apparently
taken
place.
the
court
of
claims
not
only
looked
at
the
accomplice
testimony
and
said
it
was
self
contradictory
and
uncorroborated,
but
they
said
that
this
was
jurisdictional.
why
was
it
jurisdictional,
because
it
--
somewhat
it
seemed
fit
to
have
a
separate
chapter
in
the
rules
relating
to
accomplice
testimony
and
they
--
from
this,
they
concluded
that
it
was
thought
so
important
the
accomplice
testimony
was
that
if
you
don't
properly
charge
it,
you
can't
base
a
conviction
on
and
it's
jurisdictional
a
bootstrap
argument
if
i
ever
had
one.
i
might
add
also
that
in
juhl
we
had
an
actual
waiver
of
an
instruction
on
accomplice
testimony,
which
was
offered
to
the
defense
because
the
defense
counsel,
when
the
law
officer
of
the
general
court-martial
said,
“do
you
want
an
instruction
on
accomplice
testimony?”
replied,
“no,
i
don't.
it's
not
the
theory
of
our
defense,
it's
not
important
to
our
defense.”
that's
why
i
submit
to
this
court
that
our
position
which
may
seem
to
be
a
harsh
one
that
even
for
a
lack
of
jurisdiction
in
the
court-martial,
the
court
of
claims
is
foreclosed
from
review,
is
not
as
harsh
as
it
may
sound.
because
of
the
provisions
for
adequate
review
of
these
court-martial
on
the
part
with
civilian
lawyers
when
anything,
really
damaging
to
a
defendant
takes
place,
lengthy
imprisonment,
dismissal,
dishonorable
discharge,
bad
conduct
discharge,
he
is
protected,
i
submit.
congress
has
seen
to
it
that
he
is
protected.
secondly,
if
the
court
of
claims
is
going
to
assume
jurisdiction
of
these
cases
and
elevate
the
very
close,
i
don't
even
think
it's
close
jencks
act
question
in
augenblick
to
a
constitutional
question
of
the
first
magnitude
or
take
accomplice
testimony
of
a
simple
question
where
i
think
the
court
of
claims
was
clearly
wrong
and
was
even
waived
by
the
defendant
and
say
this
is
a
jurisdictional
defect
in
the
court-martial,
you
are
going
to
have
every
single
court-martial
that
results
in
affirmance
by
at
any
point
in
the
line
brought
to
the
court
of
claims
and
one
final
effort
for
one
final
reversal.
this
is
something
that
is
contrary
to
good
sense.
i
think
it's
contrary
to
discipline
in
the
services
and
it's
not
necessary
for
the
protection
of
accused
persons,
habeas
corpus
exists
in
the
really
serious
situation.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
none
whatsoever
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
no
question
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
no
mr.
chief
justice.
now
i
say
that
if
this
court
were
to
find
that
there
is
a
limited
scope
of
review
in
the
part
of
the
court
of
claims,
it
should
fight
at
most,
that
there
is
a
right
to
review
in
respect
to
whether
the
court-martial
had
jurisdiction
of
the
person
of
the
subject
matter.
answering
an
earlier
question
mr.
justice
harlan
as
to
whether
if
article
76
did
not
exist,
would
we
be
taking
this
position
here
in
court?
the
answer
is
no,
that
the
court
of
claims
had
purported
to
exercise
the
power
to
review
courts-martial
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
in
the
past
and
i
would
concede
that
absent
article
76
today.
once
again,
i
believe
this
would
be
a
very
limited
effect
because
of
the
rarity
of
a
properly
constituted
courts-martial
because
for
any
type
of
offense
today,
legal
advice
is
available
to
the
convening
authority
can
pose
the
court
on
the
rules
for
how
to
constitute
court-martial
are
very
clearly
laid
out,
and
having
dealt
with
them
in
my
military
career
before
i
had
gone
through
a
last
couple
of
events,
so
that
a
layman
can
understand.
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
need
for
this
court
to
expand
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
claims
even
to
areas
where
on
habeas
corpus
of
district
court
could
review
a
court-martial
that
is
for
in
addition
to
jurisdiction,
constitutional
defect.
once
again
in
order
to
bootstrap
itself
into
giving
augenblick
and
juhl
back
pay,
the
court
of
claims
elevated
these
rather
elementary
and,
questions
of
certainly
not
constitutional
law
into
constitutional
questions
in
order
to
--
for
reasons
of
its
own
grant
pay
to
these
men.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
for
back
pay,
no
sir.
he
could
however
go
to
these
boards
for
the
correction
of
records
to
try
and
have
his
conviction
expunge,
which
would
give
him
the
right
to
the
back
pay.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
why?
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
it's
an
action
for
back
pay.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
that's
correct.
i
believe.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
tucker
act
case
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
no
sir,
except
i
would
say
that
in
the
sense
that
it
reviews
convictions
that,
in
my
mind
lacks
the
expertise
of
a
district
court
in
looking
into
these
matters
and
i
think
the
decisions
in
both
of
these
cases
illustrate
that
lack
of
expertise
very
well,
because
as
i
say
in
elevating
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
oh,
no
i
say
this
is
final
as
to
any
court
expect
in
habeas
corpus
situation
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
we've
taken
that
position
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
would
say
this
--
that
one
of
the
reasons
that
let
us,
and
led
me
to
make
this
argument
here
is
that
it
isn't
harsh
as
it
seems
and
i
think
pointed
out
why
it
isn't
to
the
extent
that
this
court
feels
if
our
position
is
harsh
and
is
unfair
to
people,
i
would
certainly
not
walk
out
of
this
court
room
feeling
that
the
government
has
been
done
a
disservice
if
the
court
would
hold
otherwise.
i
do
feel
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
give
the
court
of
claims
this
kind
of
power
in
order
to
protect
defendants
in
military
court.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
that
is
our
position,
but
let
me
add
one
warning
note
to
the
assumption
by
the
court
of
claims
the
power
to
decide
question
of
jurisdiction.
remember
that
in
each
of
these
cases
it
did
try
to
elevate
these
questions
into
jurisdictional
ones
and
constitutional
ones
the
only
review
of
the
court
of
claims
is
in
this
court,
does
that
mean
that
the
government
--
in
cases
such
as
these
where
they
were
clearly
wrong,
will
have
to
be
coming
to
the
supreme
court
on
rather
simple
elementary
criminal
law
questions
that
the
court
of
claims
has
demonstrated
it
lacks
expertise
on
and
their
decision
in
this
case
i
think
clearly
shows
it.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
the
language
of
article
76
together
with
the
statement
from
the
house
and
senate
reports
that
i
read
to
the
court
about
finality
indicates
that
they
did
not
consider
shapiro
or
intended
to
overrule,
and
they
did
at
one
point
say
that
the
article
76
or
the
whole
was
a
quantification,
i
don't
agree
that
shapiro
was
written
into
the
law,
it
may
have
been
but
i
just
do
not
feel
that
that
was
a
case.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
shapiro
case
was
--
it's
amusing
enough
to
recite
it
like
that,
i
think
shapiro
was
a
defendant,
a
man
at
a
court-martial,
and
the
way
he
had
done
it
was
by
substituting
one
mexican
american
for
another
and
the
rape
victim
and
everyone
else
identified
the
imposter
as
the
actual
defendant.
the
defendant
in
that
case
was
acquitted
with
so
enraged
shapiro
superiors
that
they
ordered
him
tried
for
obstructing
justice
and
they
gave
him
a
half
hour
to
prepare.
he
asked
for
counsel,
and
counsel
asked
for
time
to
prepare,
and
they
denied
it
and
they
held
in
effect
he
had
deprived
his
right
to
counsel
that
under
johnson
and
zerbst
in
effect
that
they
are
not
having
counsel
at
the
trial,
deprived
the
court
of
jurisdiction
and
therefore
they
gave
him
his
pay.
obviously,
the
government
didn't
choose
to
try
to
take
shapiro
of
this
court.
i
don't
think
the
failure
to
appeal
that
case
can
be
used
an
inference
that
we
acquiescent
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes
sir.
with
the
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i've
tried
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
know
of
none
mr.
justice
fortas,
on
the
other
hand
i
don't
--
where
the
dismissals
have
been
reviewed
in
the
appellate
courts
i
do
not
know
of
any
case
where
they've
then
gone
to
the
court
of
claims
and
sought
back
pay.
again
i'm
not
able
adequately
to
answer
your
question.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
know
of
no
statute
that
would
prevent
them
from
going
to
the
court
of
claims,
despite
the
fact
that
their
dismal
had
been
reviewed
by
the
courts
of
appeal
and
the
courts
of
claims.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well
they
have
jurisdiction
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
that's
correct
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes,
but
as
stated
by
you
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
think
the
consequences
of
these
defendants
are
much
harsher
than
they
really
are.
i
agree
with
you
though,
that
is
our
position.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
which
i
trust
i
will
get.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
very
briefly
chief
justice
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
don't
believe
it
was
mr.
justice
douglas,
the
speaker
as
to
the
board
question
that
has
been
the
subject
to
extensive
examination
by
the
court
--
there
is
a
discussion
in
our
brief
of
footnote
31
on
page
46.
in
this
brief,
our
position
that
legislative
history
of
the
statute
establishing
the
court
provides
that
there
maybe
judicial
review
under
appropriate
circumstances.
the
government
i
feel
certainly
would
take
the
position
that
if
the
underlying
action
being
reviewed
by
the
board
was
a
court-martial
that
the
finality
clause
of
article
76
would
bar
judicial
review
of
the
board's
decision.
the
board's
decision
however
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
think
that
case
is
clearly
wrong
to
the
extent
that
it
says
if
you
can
review
a
board.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
you'll
see
it
from
the
court
of
claims
decision
in
juhl
that
there
are
two
questions
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
there
was
not
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
here
no,
but
i
said
if
the
question
arose
again
whether
the
board
for
the
correction
of
records
could
be
reviewed
in
court
when
they
have
corrected
a
court-martial,
we
would
urge
that
article
76
bars
judicial
review
of
that
board
ashe.
yeah,
finally
in
conclusion
i
would
like
to
i
think
place
this
case
in
respect
to
both
these
cases
by
saying
that
i
think
we
are
all
concerned
about
probably
is
whether
a
military
defendant
has
access
at
some
point
to
a
civilian
court
to
make
sure
that
he
was
not
convicted
on
fundamentally
unfair
grounds
by
fundamentally
unfair
procedures
and
briefly
these
are
the
instances
under
which
a
military
defendant
can
at
some
point
get
civilian
review
by
a
civilian
court.
he
is
imprisoned
over
one
year;
he
can
go
to
the
court
of
military
appeals
or
of
course
habeas
corpus.
he
is
dismissed
from
the
service
as
was
augenblick;
it's
a
bad
conduct
or
dishonorable
discharge.
he
is
an
enlisted
man;
he
can
go
to
the
court
of
military
appeals,
which
is
a
civilian
court.
if
he
is
imprisoned
for
less
than
one
year,
truly
must
act
promptly,
but
he
can
seek
the
remedy
of
habeas
corpus
and
that
remedy
has
been
made
much
more
meaningful
by
this
court,
because
even
if
he
has
properly
applied
for
that
writ,
even
though
his
imprisonment
is
over
and
he
has
served
his
term,
this
court
has
recently
held
in
the
carafus
v.
lavallee
case
that
he
can
pursue
his
habeas
remedy
and
have
his
conviction
expunged.
therefore,
only
in
the
petty
area
where
a
fine
is
imposed
or
a
reduction
in
pay
takes
place
is
he
foreclosed
by
review
by
habeas
or
the
court
of
military
appeals.
i
think
that
this
situation
shows
that
fundamentally
the
position
the
government
has
urged
is
fair,
thank
you.
