j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
true
the
second

76
2,
that
binding
upon
all
the
departments
of
court's
agencies.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
mean
does
that
have
that
limitation
that
you
suggest,
certainly
it
doesn't
on
the
face
of
it,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
mr.
sharlitt
on
its
face
the
language
is
all
action
taken
to
disown
to
those
proceedings
or
binding
upon
all
departments,
courts.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
the
courts
had
to
do
with
the
man?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
they
have
to
do
with
the
chain
of
command
control?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
listening
to
your
argument,
you
do
not
take
the
position
that
congress
could
not
have
barred
the
court
of
claims
from
making
this
enquiry
do
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

could
not
congress
constitutionally
have
barred
the
court
of
claims
for
making
this
enquiry.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now

said
that
the
court
of
claims
might
not,
could
not
had
no
jurisdiction
if
you
please
whatever
language
you
want
to
use,
barred
the
court
of
claims
from
making
any
inquiry
into
this
court-martial
that
it
did
make.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
congress
could
abolish
the
court
of
claims
couldn't
it,
it
created
them.

j.
brennan,
jr.
