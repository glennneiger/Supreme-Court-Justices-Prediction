justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
weisl,
could
this
plaintiff
go
anywhere
else
beside
the
court
of
claims
to
sue
for
back
pay?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
can't
he
go
to
the
court
of
claims
on
this
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah.
this
is
just
--
what
kind
of
a
suit
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
back
pay,
and
that's
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
claims
and
no
other
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
case
of
shapiro
--
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
don't
--
you
don't
then
just
say
that
there
is
anything
distinctive
about
court
of
claims
as
compared
with
a
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
based
your
finality
argument
on
the
fact
this
is
the
court
of
claims
as
distinguished
from
district
court
or
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
the
court
of
claims
still
has
jurisdiction
over
commander
augenblick's
claim,
they
just
deny
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
sue
or
they
sue
and
there's
a
defense
that
he
is
in
service.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
have
given
and
they
grant
summary
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
go
to
the
court
of
military
appeal.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
they
had
taken
it
and
affirmed
it,
wouldn't
it
come
to
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
fact
we
are
talking
about
a
particular
tribunal
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
that,
where
do
you
find
that
on
the
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
anywhere
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
congress
said
that
in
no
events
will
supreme
court
review
any
instances
of
court-martial
judgments?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
you
can't
find
any
grant
by
the
congress
of
any
jurisdiction
for
this
court
to
review
courts-martial.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
some
sort
of
collateral
relief
inside
the
military?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
section
is
that
under
67?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
that
involve?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
that
involve
jury
or
is
that
on
the
record
and
-?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you,
are
there
some
jurisdictional
limits
on
what
the
board
can
do
in
the
sense
could
they
have
reconsidered
your
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
you
could
have
had
your
review
on
the
court
of
claims
from
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
how?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
filing
a
suit
for
back
pay?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
what
you've
done?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now
if
you're
going
to
do
that.
if
that's
the
way,
would
you
say
you
have
a
de
novo
review
here
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
it
be
on
the
record
of
the
board
of
review?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
express
statute
which
grants
the
court
of
claims
this
kind
of
jurisdiction
to
review
appellate
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
namely
a
pay
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
that's
--
and
your
authority
for
that
is
what
just
logic
or
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
either
one
of
--
does
any
of
the
statute
say
that
this
kind
of
a
determination
may
be
reviewed
in
the
court
of
claims?
justice
byron
r.
white
you've
got
that
in
your
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
the
other
man
--
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
involved
in
the
ashe
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
plus
the
28
u.s
code.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
there
would
be
any
limit
on
the
nature
of
the
attack
which
the
secretary
of
the
board
under
this
section
could
have
entertained.
justice
byron
r.
white
under
this
section,
he
could
just
say
–-
he
can
say
there
has
been
an
error
here,
because
there
wasn't
enough
evidence
to
sustain
my
conviction
by
the
court-martial
and
the
-–
and
so
the
secretary
could
if
he
wanted
to
despite
76
review
the
evidence
and
then
you
would
say
the
court
might
review
him.

of

is
it?
justice
byron

back
pay,
and
that's
within
the
