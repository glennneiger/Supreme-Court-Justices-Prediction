justice
potter
stewart
how
would
he
go
about,
he
was
dismissed
of
course
from
the
service?
justice
potter
stewart
how
would
they
go
about
after
the
court
of
claims
decisions
if
they
stand
are
getting
reinstated?
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
know
whether
that's
happened
or
neither.
justice
potter
stewart
incidentally,
the
court
of
military
appeals
denied
review
in
the
augenblick
case,
but
it
was
in
effort
to
get
in
juhl
a
review
of
the
court
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
military
appeals
is
completely
discretionary.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
augenblick's
conviction
one
that
was
within
the
–-
justice
potter
stewart
could
have
been
reviewed,
but
it's
discretionary
whether
or
not
–
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
he
wasn't
sentenced
to
jail.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
augenblick
i
gather
after
the
denial
by
the
court
of
appeal,
government's
position
must
be,
he
had
nowhere
else
to
go,
he
couldn't
have
come
here.
justice
potter
stewart
he
couldn't
come
here
from
the
court
of
military
appeal.
justice
potter
stewart
so
he
is
finished.
justice
potter
stewart
now
that's
why
i
asked
you,
what
do
you
mean
that
in
effect
upheld,
they
simply
refused
him
--
justice
potter
stewart
we
don't
uphold
things
here
when
we
refuse,
when
we
deny
cert.
justice
potter
stewart
internally
within
the
service.
justice
potter
stewart
do
these
two
cases
go
through
such
boards.
justice
potter
stewart
by
the
chain
of
command
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
i
gather
it,
and
if
actually
there
had
been
a
serious
defect
in
this
court-martial,
even
constitutional
in
augenblick's
case.
since
he
could
not
go
to
habeas,
i
gather
and
the
court
of
military
appeals
here
had
denied
it.
even
though
there
is
a
serious
constitutional
defect
in
this
court-martial
conviction.
no
court
can
do
anything
about.
justice
potter
stewart
that
has
to
be
your
position.
justice
potter
stewart
were
they
still
however
substantial
in
that
--
we
might
think
it's
substantially,
they
might
not
and
refuse
review,
is
that
so?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
but
they
might
refuse
review.
justice
potter
stewart
and
we
couldn't
reach
it.
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
suppose
that
mr.
weisl,
if
one
convicted
by
a
military
court
marital
really
has
a
substantial
constitutional
claim,
and
he
just
got
a
bang
that
he's
sentenced
to
prison,
so
he
can
under
habeas
corpus
shouldn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
how
do
you
preserve
only
where
he
is
sent
to
prison?
justice
potter
stewart
otherwise
as
i
understand
your
answers
to
mr.
justice
fortas
no
matter
how
defective
the
court
martial
proceeding,
if
the
court
of
military
appeals
doesn't
review
it,
you
can't
ever
get
any
judicial
review.
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
think
dismal
from
the
service.
augenblick
was
in
the
previous
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
where
you
reading?
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
that,
at
least
your
primary
argument
is
that
even
jurisdictional
questions
are
not
reviewable
in
a
pay
claim
in
the
court
of
claims?
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
--
even
if
given
its
all
traditional
power
that
it
use
to
exercise
around
the
century
and
perhaps
later
prior
to
the
recent
wholesale
amendments
of
the
military
justice
system,
you
would
say
that
these
two
cases
certainly
don't
even
come
close
to
be
approaching
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
wanted
to
follow
that
up
with
one
more
question
that
is
the
shapiro
case,
which
did
go
considerably
further
than
the
earlier
jurisdictional
cases
in
the
court
of
claims
and
which
was
on
the
books
at
the
time
that
congress
enacted
the
new
legislation
with
respect
to
military
justice
and
therefore
congress
can
be
presumed
to
have
known
about
that
case,
what
do
you
with
that?
justice
potter
stewart
what
were
the
facts
of
the
shapiro
case?
justice
potter
stewart
well
let
me
ask
you
this,
then
you
are
saying
if,
if
we
were
to
constitute
a
76
as
barring
the
court
of
claims
from
making
this
inquiry
then
your
position
is
that
article
76
is
unconstitutional.
justice
potter
stewart
well
let
me
see
how
far
that
goes
mr.
sharlitt.
suppose
then
this
had
been
taken
to
the
court
of
military
appeals
and
had
been
a
constitutional
claim
and
had
been
resolved
against
your
position
by
the
court
of
military
appeal.
are
you
saying
we
then
would
have
had
jurisdiction
to
review
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
military
appeals.
justice
potter
stewart
then
i
don't
follow
your
argument
that
this
court
should
be
the
tribunal
of
last
resort
on
the
constitutional
claims
of
servicemen.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no
that's
wasn't
my
question
to
you.
suppose
he
had
done
his
application
in
the
court
of
military
appeals
had
been
granted.
they
had
considered
his
claim
on
the
merits,
the
court-martial
has
dismissal
on
the
merits
and
had
affirmed
the
dismissal,
finding
no
merit
in
his
constitutional
claims
the
ones
you
are
now
asserting
and
did
ascertain
the
court
of
claims.
could
this
court
ever
view
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
military
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
then
there
are
exceptions
for
your
general
proposition
that
this
court
should
remain
the
court
of
last
resort
for
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
did,
he
had
an
opportunity
for
review
and
it
was
denied
to
him
in
the
court
of
military
appeals
wouldn't
it,
on
these,
on
these
very
same
claims?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
the
law,
the
case
law
of
the
court
of
military
appeals
is
it?
isn't
that
the
tribunal
trusted
basically
with
the
development
of
the
case
law
for
court's
martial
in
this
area.
justice
potter
stewart
mthey
can
be
counted
on
to
do
so
based
on
their
past
record.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
have
a
board,
do
we
appoint
a
board
for
that
purpose
or
--
a
permanent
board
or
you
have
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
indicates
there's
a
board.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
–
that
difference
between
your
case
and
the
augenblick
case
namely
that
you
did
apply
to
the
board
for
correction
of
records
and
had
its
determination
before
you
went
to
the
court
of
claims.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
one
--
but
i
just
want
to
be
sure
in
the
augenblick
case,
that
did
not
happen.
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
saying
that
whatever
may
it
be,
as
i
understand
you
now,
whatever
may
be
the
interpretation
on
‘76
that
there
is
review
in
the
court
of
claims
of
the
determination
of
the
board
to
correct
the
records
because
congress
considered
having
the
same
prohibition
against
judicial
review
as
determinations
of
that
board
and
rejected
that
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
where
is
that?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
suppose
if
shapiro
was
considered
by
the
congress
in
the
context
of
all
of
this.
shapiro
at
least
indicated
that
there
was
authority
in
the
court
of
claims
to
act
on
these
claims.
justice
potter
stewart
what
you
are
saying
is
when
they
came
up,
as
i
understand
you
now,
on
the
applications
made
for
review
to
the
board
of
corrections
of
records,
that
they
considered
the
same
kind
of
the
prohibition
against
additional
review
that
we
have
in
‘76
and
rejected
it,
is
that
what
you're
telling?
justice

stewart
how
would
he
go
about,
he
