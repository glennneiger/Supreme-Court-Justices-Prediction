mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
let's
get
right
to
the
heart
of
the
matter.
there
is
an
issue
of
law
before
the
court.
the
issue
of
law
is
posed
by
the
government's
position
in
this
case.
the
government
is
proposing
that
all
servicemen
who've
been
subjected
to
unconstitutional
abuse
in
their
courts-martial
and
have
been
dismissed
and
disgraced,
cannot
go
to
any
civilian
court,
cannot
come
to
this
court
for
protection
of
their
constitutional
rights.
the
government
would
have
this
court
believe
that
congress
did
this,
this
sweeping
reform,
not
by
any
statutory
language
nor
by
any
manifestation
of
legislative
intent,
but
did
this
by
silence.
mr.
weisl
has
said
that
this
is
not
a
harsh
result.
the
case
i'm
talking
about,
which
is
completely
within
the
government's
position,
as
it
was
articulated
here
today,
is
that
if
the
defendant
is
denied
counsel,
is
tortured
into
a
confession,
is
ordered
convicted
by
a
kangaroo
court
and
is
given
trail
by
fire
or
ordeal,
by
order
of
his
commanding
officer
and
then
dismissed
and
disgraced,
rather
than
put
in
jail
he
can
go
nowhere.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
he
can
go
to
the
court
of
military
appeal,
that's
correct.
and
we
have
a
perfect
example
of
what
happened
in
the
court
of
military
appeals
here
in
this
case.
the
court
of
military
appeals
denied
this
case
without
any
provision
for
--
without
any
reason
for
it,
without
any
statement
denied
review
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
no,
no
there
is
no
jurisdiction
between
the
court
of
military
appeals
and
this
court.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
there
is
no
certiorari
jurisdiction
to
the
court
of
military
appeals
from
this
court.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
well
contrary
to
what
mr.
weisl
said
and
so
far
as
i
read
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
their
jurisdiction
over
matters
such
as
this
is
discretionary
above
the
limit
that
mr.
weisl
posed.
that
is
to
say
if
there
is
a
fine
of
a
certain
amount
or
dismal,
then
they
have
discretionary
jurisdiction,
they
don't
have
to
take
the
case
and
in
this
case
they
did
not.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
their
discretion
here
and
they
did
not
need
to
--
they
deemed
not
to
exercise
their
discretion.
but
the
real
key
to
this
mr.
justice
white
is
not
really
where
you
can
go
the
court
of
military
appeals
where
the
constitutional
rights
of
servicemen
can
be
the
final
arbiter
of
these
constitutional
rights
is
this
court.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
in
this
case?
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
mr.
justice
marshall
we're
talking
in
this
case
about
the
constitutional
right
to
preparing
adequate
defense
against
impropriety
that
it
spreads
throughout
this
record.
now
this
record,
on
this
face
it
involves
four
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
the
denial
of
due
process
here
is
the
depravation
of
the
right
of
the
defense
through
statutory
rights
that
he's
been
granted
to
prepare
a
defense
against
impropriety
that
is
right
from
this
record.
and
if
i
can
recite
the
facts,
after
all
due
process
as
it
seems
to
me
a
visceral
reaction
to
facts
and
the
facts
of
this
case
are
as
follows.
in
this
case
you
had
--
you
had
first
a
sex
offense
in
which
it's
a
private
offense
in
which
the
word
of
the
participants
are
the
--
or
the
only
things
that
can
give
the
light
to
the
accusation.
you
had
secondly
the
chief
accuser,
the
accuser
whose
evidence
was
the
controlling
evidence
in
the
conviction
here
interviewed
immediately
after
the
arrest
by
agents
of
the
office
of
naval
intelligence.
prior
to
this
interview
this
chief
and
controlling
witness,
this
partner
in
this
alleged
crime
had
any
participation
in
it
by
him
and
by
the
defendant.
after
the
interview
he
changed
his
story
and
claim
that
there
was
a
sex
act,
that
he
participated
in
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
court
of
military
appeals?
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
i
think
if
could
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
i
think
that's
correct
sir.
if
i
can
deal
with
them
in
just
that
order
and
get
back
to
it
mr.
justice
marshall's
question,
because
i
think
it's
important
to
deal
with
the
facts
as
they
really
were
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
no
sir,
he
was
used
--
it
doesn't
go
to
credibility,
what
it
does
do
is
that
it
goes
to
the
question
of
impropriety
on
the
part
of
the
prosecution
and
arranging
for
the
testimony
of
this
key
witness.
the
one
fact
that
i
didn't
add,
which
is
quite
compelling
in
this
case
is
that
after
this
change
of
story
which
took
place
during
this
interview,
this
airman
was
promised
an
honorable
discharge
and
its
so
stated
in
the
record.
but
he
was
not
given
this
discharge.
this
discharge
was
kept
hanging
over
his
head
through
nine
months
and
through
two
trials
and
only
after
he
testified
against
the
commander
with
a
testimony
that
he
had
changed
during
this
interview,
was
he
then
grated
this
honorable
discharge.
he
wasn't
punished
at
all,
although
under
the
laws
of
the
military
he
was
at
least
pari
delicto
with
the
defendant
here.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
no,
i
think
it
goes,
mr.
chief
justice
to
a
point
beyond
credibility.
it
goes
to
the
question
of
impropriety,
it
goes
to
the
question
of
the
ability
of
the
defendant
to
raise
a
defense
against
the
chief
witness
against
him.
the
violations
here,
against
which
all
the
facts
that
i've
just
recited
must
be
arranged
as
a
backdrop.
the
violation
here
were
violations
of
the
jencks
act.
a
tape
was
taken
of
this
key
interview
two
hours
afterwards,
during
which
time
this
witness
changed
his
story,
this
sole
witness
of
this
very
grave
crime.
and
it
was
this
tape
that
was
admittedly
taken
that
was
denied
to
the
defendant
and
it
was
notes
taken
by
the
interrogator.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
it
was
never
denied
that
it
was
in
existence
at
the
time
it
was
made
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
you're
quite
correct
it
was
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
that
quite
correct
there
was
dispute--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
that
question
of
fact
was
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
that
is
a
question
of
fact
clearly.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
it
is
in
this
case
for
the
following
reason.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
no,
certainly
not,
the
facts
can
very
often
and
most
often
not
be,
but
in
this
case
the
resolution
of
this
problem
by
the
navy
was
to
put
the
burden
of
proof
of
bad
faith
on
the
government
in
losing
this
tape
or
in
destroying
it
on
the
defendant.
this
obligation
for
production
is
the
government's
obligation.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
by
itself
sir
it
doesn't
deal
with
any
constitutional
section
at
all
that's
a
violation.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
no
sir
these
are
questions
of
law,
every
one
of
them,
these
are
questions
of
law
and
the
administration
of
the
jencks
act
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
judge
davis,
speaking
from
unanimous
court
below
said
that
it's
obvious
that
in
all
cases
jencks
act
violation
are
not
violations
of
the
constitution
and
we
adhere
to
that
position,
but
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
with
the
navy
dealing
with
the
absence
of
these
key
jencks
materials
by
placing
the
burden
on
the
defendant
to
prove
good
faith
or
to
prove
bad
faith
rather
than
the
government.
a
defendant
who
is
powerless
to
prove
any
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
the,
on
the
part
of
the
government,
when
the
government
has
the
obligation
to
produce
that
rule
of
law
sir
is
a
rule
of
law
that
is
reviewable
and
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
that's
quite
true
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
that's
quite
true
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
and
it's
quite
true,
but
that
navy's
the
exoneration
of
the
government's
obligation
to
produce
these
tapes,
which
were
obviously,
which
were
in
the
navy's
hands,
which
were
hand
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
well,
the
navy
was
--
the
individual
who
took
the
tape
was
last
one
who
the
record
shows
have
the
tapes
and
he
was
one
in
whose
hands
the
tape
disappeared.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
and
the
one
is
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
there
is
certainly
evidence
to
that
effect
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
there
is
certainly
evidence
to
that
effect,
but
there
is
also
evidence
that
this
was
in
violation
of
the
navy's
owns
policies
and
regulations
with
regard
to
jencks
materials.
there
is
further
testimony
that
the
last
person
that
had
this
tape
was
the
same
person
that
was
in
this
interview
that
denied
for
at
least
12
pages
of
testimony
that
this
tape
never
had
been
taken
and
then
it's
given
into
his
hands
by
superior
officer
and
from
his
hands
had
disappeared.
and
then
the
navy
justifies
this
conduct
by
saying
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
defendants
to
show
that
the
navy
was
in
bad
faith.
that
sir
is
a
rule
of
law,
that
sir
is
--
it
raises
on
the
factual
pattern
to
this
case
a
constitutional
question,
not
as
the
jencks
act.
there
is
a
right
of
the
defendant
to
raise
the
defense
as
impropriety
on
the
facts
of
this
case
and
no
further.
now
if
i
can
go
back
to
the
question
that
was
raised
by
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
think
that
--
we
have
to
look
at
the
background
of
the
enactment
of
article
76.
article
76
is
word
for
word
of
article
50
h
article
of
war
50
h
and
act
of
1948.
this
as
we
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
page
61
came
as
a
result
of
the
post
war
reforms
of
the
articles
of
war.
contrary
to
any
attempt
trying
to
eliminate
rights
of
servicemen
the
vanderbilt
report
which
gave
rise
to
the
kim
elston
amendments
in
1948
had
as
it
point
the
enlargement
and
the
protection
of
servicemen
and
the
vanderbilt
report
indicated
that
the
point
of
the
van
article
50
h
which
became
word
for
word
article
76
is
to
indicate
at
what
point
inside
the
military
establishment
these
judgments
becomes
final,
that
is
to
say
that
they
are
impervious
to
command
control.
they
can't
be
set
aside
by
commanding
officers
deciding
they
don't
like
to
resolve
this
court
martial
and
trying
by
another
court.
that
was
point
of
article
76
and
it
was
a
point
articulated
by
judge
vanderbilt
in
the
vanderbilt
report,
there
was
not
a
word
said
about
the
court
of
claims.
there
was
not
a
word
said
about
civilian
review
in
all
of
the
deliberations
that
gave
rise
to
kim
elston
amendments.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
yes
sir,
that
is
because
i
think.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
well,
we
--
the
point
of
that
is
as
far
as
i
can
see
there
were
some,
there
are
very
many
muddy
things
about
this,
but
there
is
about
the
legislative
history
in
this,
the
point
of
that
as
far
as
i
can
see
is
the
elimination
of
command
control
in
the
first
place
to
indicate
where
the
cutting
off
point
of
military
procedures
are
as
it
was
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
courts,
yes
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
i
believe
the
meaning
of
that
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
well,
i
believe
that
what
they
had
to
do
with
that
in
a
situation
such
as
this
where
you
had
the
--
where
you
had
a
court-martial
determination
that
the
civilian,
the
federal
civilian
courts,
which
is
all
that
could
be
ruled
upon
here
could
not
under
those
circumstances
try
to
service
him
for
the
same
crime.
i
think
it
had
that
effect
which
is
wholly
apart
from
anything
we
are
talking
about
here.
now
there
is
some
legislative
history
to
that
effect
mr.
justice
brennan
but
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
collateral
views
these
matters
for
constitutional,
for
constitutional
errors.
now
i
would
point
that
when
i
say
that
everything
that
the
government
says
today
here
is
based
on
silence
i
mean
silence
because
i
think
that
the
article
50
h
aimed
at
the
elimination
of
command
control,
aimed
at
picking
a
point
of
time
at
which
military
remedies
were
exhausted
so
that
you
could
then
go
to
the
civilian
remedies
and
in
1948
when
the
kim
elston
amendments
came
into
being
which
became
article
76
two
years
later
there
isn't
a
single
word
about
the
elimination
of
the
traditional
courts
of
claims
remedy
for
back
pay,
not
one
word
anywhere
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
oh,
i
think
that's
clear
the
court
of
claims
is
not
an
ordinary
appellate
review
of
military
court-martial
under
no
circumstances.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
i
would
very
hardly
agree
with
that
sir,
that
unless
you
have
rules
of
law
that
come
to
this
court
as
rules
of
law
and
don't
involve
any
resifting
of
the
evidence,
which
this
court
very
specifically
proscribed
in
burns
versus
wilson
then
you
don't
have
any
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
claims,
but
you
do
have
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
claims
where
you
have
rules
of
law
such
as
you
have
in
this
case,
such
as
you,
the
putting
of
the
burden
for
showing
bad
faith
in
the
destruction
of
the
jencks
materials
or
the
negligent
loss
of
that
material
on
the
defendant,
such
as
the
failure
to
conduct
an
in
camera
examination
of
the
notes
taken
during
this
key
interview,
such
as
the
failure
to
call
the
key
witness
to
testify
as
to
what
happened,
the
witness
who
denied
of
taking
this
tapes
and
the
witness
in
whose
hands
this
tape
disappeared,
failure
to
call
him,
these
are
rules
of
law.
these
are
not
--
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
facts,
they
dot
no
require
any
shifting
of
the
evidence
by
the
court
of
claims
or
by
any
court.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
oh,
absolutely
not,
no
we
are
not
our
position
is
not.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
what
we
are
saying
here
sir
is
that
exactly
right,
that
the
jencks
deprivation
is
that,
the
right
as
this
court
annunciated
in
all
the
cases
in
johnson
versus
zerbst
court
filed
through
the
most
recent
one
through
the
giles
case
and
all
the
case
right
down
the
line,
that
a
defendant
is
entitled
to
a
trial
free
from
impropriety
is
meaningless
tool
unless
the
rights
guaranteed
him
by
statute
exist
to
him
to
enquire
into
that
impropriety
and
the
right
to
enquire
into
that
impropriety
where
the
impropriety
is
on
the
record
as
it
is
in
this
case,
is
coextensive
and
vindictive
with
his
right
to
a
trail
free
from
that,
that
impropriety.
now
i
would
go,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
on
the
very
day,
that
the
very
next
day
rather,
june
25th
1948
the
kim
elston
act
passed
article
50
h,
which
is
in
haec
verba
where
the
article
76
exactly
the
same.
the
tucker
act
was
reenacted
by
the
congress
intact
--
that's
the
best
jurisdiction
recorded
claims
to
do
just
what
did
the
augenblick
case
and
it
was
reenacted
with
considerable
legislative
history
and
there
isn't
one
word
on
a
major
excision
of
one
of
the
functions
of
the
court
of
claims
in
that
history.
although
five
years
later,
when
the
court
of
claims
when
the
tuckers
act
was
again
reenacted
and
a
portion
of
its
jurisdiction
excised
it
was
done
in
unmistakable
terms.
in
1953
the
court
of
claims
act
was
–-
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
the
congress
could
not
have
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
mr.
justice
brennan
that
raises
one
of
the
great,
great
questions
of
constitutional
law
that
i
think
is
presently
unresolved.
i
think
that
there
is
grave
doubt
that
the
congress
could
have
told
service
men
who
have
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
i
think
that
congress
that
there
is
some
large
question
of
constitutionality
as
to
whether
congress
can
do
that,
and
i
said
so
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
oh,
yes,
they
readily
do
that,
the
question
is
whether
congress
could
take
servicemen
who
have
acknowledged
constitutional
rights,
this
court
has
articulated
in
burns
versus
wilson.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
yes
sir.
but
and
i,
and
my
answer
has
to
involve
the
question,
constitutional
rights
of
serviceman,
the
congress
certainly
could
do
that
sir.
but
congress,
i
don't
think
can
take
a
group
of
american
citizens
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
we
say
this
in
our
brief,
we
stand
by
it
sir.
the
reason
being
that
here
you
have
constitutional
rights
of
serviceman,
so
articulated
by
this
court
clearly
in
burns
versus
wilson.
we
have
no
article
3
court
to
go
to,
to
protect
those
rights.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
no
sir,
burns
is
habeas
corpus,
but
burns
articulated
constitutional
rights
mr.
justice
marshall
and
my
point
is
that
if
there
are
constitutional
rights,
then
they
are
meaningless
unless
there
is
a
court
to
protect
them
and
in
article
i
court
such
as
court
of
military
appeals
which
had
none
of
the
attributes
of
an
article
iii
court
which
has,
well
i
think
the
selling
substance
is
that
the
supreme
court
is
and
should
remain
the
final
arbiter
--
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
servicemen.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
no
sir,
i
do
not
i
want
you
to
--
i
want
this
court
simply
to
view
the
legislative
history
as
i
believe
its
properly
viewed
and
that
is
not
in
anyway
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
no
sir.
no
i
am
saying
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
because
the
only
way
under
the
circumstances
that
commander
augenblick
could
get
in
this
court
is
sue
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
no
sir
cannot,
they
cannot
not
by
direct
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
no
sir,
they
are
not,
because
i
am
saying
that
in
order
to
accept
a
government
position
you
have
to,
you
have
to
state
that
the
place
that
the
commander
did
go
to
him,
the
court
of
claims
has
denied
him.
his
only
--
the
reason
that
he
would
have
no
review
would
be
that
he
was
cut
off
in
the
court
of
claims
review,
that
its
his
only
avenue
to
come
here.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
my
point
was
that
the,
our
(inaudible)
of
constitutionality
of
serviceman
should
be
the
supreme
court
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
i
don't
sir,
i
don't
find
it
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
i
don't
find
it
in
the
constitution
but
i
do
believe
that
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
if
they
had
said
that
the
question
would
have
been
posed
squarely
and
it
hasn't
said
that
and
i
think
until
it
does
this
court
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
no
sir,
but
i
can
give
you
a
long
line
of
cases
where
this
court
is
strained
in
every
circumstance
to
find
judicial
review
in
a
situation
where
congress
has
purported
to
grant
finality
to
an
administrative
agency.
starting
with
carlebach
(ph)
and
after
the
civil
war
and
going
right
through
yakes
(ph)
through
all
of
these
cases
where
this
court
looking
at
ambiguous
congressional
enactments
has
always
attempted
to
find
some
review,
now
it's
turned
other
way
around
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
he
is
out
in
prison
sir?
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
oh
and
those
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
no,
i
don't,
if
he
had
been
denied
back
pay
i
believe
that
if
he
falls
within
the
jurisdictional
limits.
i'd
say
that
he'd
be
entitled
that.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
no
sir,
no
because
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
he
would
have
to
show
exactly
what
judge
davis
and
unanimous
court
found
below
that
the
record
supported
a
finding
of
unconstitutionality
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
then
i
think
you
have
a
case
exactly
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
i
believe
under
those
circumstances
that
the
court
of
claims
jurisdiction
for
back
pay
still
exists
and
that
case
it
would
be
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
well
army
discipline
sir
is
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
well
army
discipline
sir
is
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
well
army
discipline
is
always
involved
in
these
matters,
when
army,
army
prosecutions
are
conducted
irregularly.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
i
don't
think
constitutionality
of
court-martials
turns
on
whether
a
man
is
out
or
in
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
well
discipline
and
unconstitutionality
are
two
different
things
and
this
court
has
said
so.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
absolutely
not
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
no
sir,
not
even
close,
miles
apart,
miles
apart
because
i
might
point
out
that
twice
in
17
years
the
court
of
claims
has
exercised
its
jurisdiction
and
in
the
augenblick
case
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
well
i
might
point
out
that
there
has
been
no
flood
in
the
court
of
claims
and
there
won't
be
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
well
now,
i
think
the
number
there
would
at
least
eight
times,
at
least
seven
times,
mr.
justice
marshall
where
these
cases
were
taken
to
the
court
of
claims,
where
the
court
of
claims
went
through
the
exercise
that
the
government
now
says
was
forbidden
to
of
looking
at
the
merits
assume
jurisdiction
looked
at
the
merits
and
denied
the
relief
on
grounds
that
there
wasn't
any
constitutional
exercise
so
that
if
there
were
any
clubhouse
for
barracks
and
lawyers
they
have
always
existed
and
it
hasn't
been
the
language
of
the
article
76,
that's
inhibited
this
review,
it's
been
the
restraint
of
the
court
of
claims.
the
court
of
claims
is
looking,
was
it
looking,
but
it
was
waiting
until
it
was
faced
with
a
proper
record
and
it
didn't
act
until
it
was
faced
with
a
proper
record.
now
if
this
man,
if
this
man
is
denied
review
by
the
court
of
claims
then
among
the
various
consequences
the
jencks
act
can
be
forgotten
in
the
military
because
the
military,
the
rule
of
law
that
will
apply
on
the
military
is
that
anytime
the
prosecution
has
jencks
material
he
doesn't
want
to
turn
over
to
the
defendant
then
he
just
doesn't
turn
it
over
and
hopes
the
defendant
can't
prove
that
he
didn't
destroy
it.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
that's
correct
sir,
that's
correct.
now
that
is
the
case
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
no
but
as
mr.
weisl
pointed
out
that
there
is
an
additional
quantum
of,
well
of
rejection
that's
involved
in
the
c.m.a's
turning
down
a
case
simply
much
more
than
this
court
simply
turning
down
a
case
and
i
would
point
out
that
in
the
board
of
review,
the
board
of
review's
opinion
which
deals
with
this
case
that
the
law,
the
law
now
is
as
the
law
from
the
military
since
this
went
to
the
court
of
military
appeals
and
there
was
no
review
of
this
determination
on
jencks,
is
that
the
burden,
the
clear
burden
and
they
couldn't
be
clear,
it's
in
the
record
here.
the
clear
burden
falls
on
the
defendant
to
prove
bad
faith.
now
that
has
never
been
ruled
on,
that
point
have
never
before
been
ruled
on
by
the
c.m.a.
so
that
that
apparently
is
law
of
the
military
unless
this
court
does
something
about
it.
now,
this
is
court
is
not
sitting
in
a
supervisory
role
over
the
c.m.a.,
i'm
not
pointing
that
out.
but
i'm
pointing
out
is
one
of
the
necessary
consequences
of
this
court's
dealing
with
what
is
a
clear
constitutional
question
in
terms
of
this
man's
right
to
defend
himself
would
be
the
therapeutic
effect
on
the
military
of
this
complete
misconception
of
jencks
rights
and
it
went
not
only
to
one
point
but
it
went
to
four
points.
it
went
to
the
burden
approved
being
put
on
the
wrong
party
when
a
jencks
material
is
not
produced,
the
failure
to
conduct
in
a
camera
examination
of
admitted
notes,
admitted
jencks
materials,
the
failure
to
incorporate
those
notes
into
the
record
so
that
anybody
the
court
of
military
appeals
or
anybody
else
could
review
it
and
a
failure
to
call
a
key
witness
to
determine
what
happened
to
these
states.
the
witness
that
denied,
it
was
taken
on
the
witness
in
whose
hands
it
disappeared.
under
circumstances
that
are
most
incriminating.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
yes
sir,
it
would.
because
the
reason
that
the
sole
way
to
come
--
again
the
sole
way
to
determine
the
constitutionality
of
this
action
would
be
in
this
court
and
the
only
way
that
the
commander
could
to
this
court
would
then
be
through
the
court
of
claims
under
those
circumstances
the
rule
was,
the
scope
of
civilian
review
as
enunciated
in
burns
versus
wilson
is
whether
fair
consideration
has
been
given.
now
some
consideration
is
not
fair
consideration,
and
when
rules
of
law
are
completely
misstated,
i
don't
believe
that
any
court
would
determine
that
this
is
fair
consideration
and
i
would
say
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
constitutional
issue
has
been
raised
in
these
jencks
act
violations,
that
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
the
court
of
claims
neither
in
1948
or
1950
was
exercised
in
this
jurisdiction,
nothing
was
said
about
them
and
point
of
fact
the
only
thing
was
said
what
to
the
effect
--
was
to
the
effect
in
a
report
that
was
filed
in
the
congressional
record
that
the
court
of
claims
jurisdiction
remained
and
under
those
circumstances
this
court
cannot
deprive
servicemen
of
the
right
to
come
to
this
court
by
silence
and
by
implication.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
let's
get
right
to
the
heart
of
the
matter.
there
is
an
issue
of
law
before
the
court.
the
issue
of
law
is
posed
by
the
government's
position
in
this
case.
the
government
is
proposing
that
all
servicemen
who've
been
subjected
to
unconstitutional
abuse
in
their
courts-martial
and
have
been
dismissed
and
disgraced,
cannot
go
to
any
civilian
court,
cannot
come
to
this
court
for
protection
of
their
constitutional
rights.
the
government
would
have
this
court
believe
that
congress
did
this,
this
sweeping
reform,
not
by
any
statutory
language
nor
by
any
manifestation
of
legislative
intent,
but
did
this
by
silence.
mr.
weisl
has
said
that
this
is
not
a
harsh
result.
the
case
i'm
talking
about,
which
is
completely
within
the
government's
position,
as
it
was
articulated
here
today,
is
that
if
the
defendant
is
denied
counsel,
is
tortured
into
a
confession,
is
ordered
convicted
by
a
kangaroo
court
and
is
given
trail
by
fire
or
ordeal,
by
order
of
his
commanding
officer
and
then
dismissed
and
disgraced,
rather
than
put
in
jail
he
can
go
nowhere.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
he
can
go
to
the
court
of
military
appeal,
that's
correct.
and
we
have
a
perfect
example
of
what
happened
in
the
court
of
military
appeals
here
in
this
case.
the
court
of
military
appeals
denied
this
case
without
any
provision
for
--
without
any
reason
for
it,
without
any
statement
denied
review
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
no,
no
there
is
no
jurisdiction
between
the
court
of
military
appeals
and
this
court.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
there
is
no
certiorari
jurisdiction
to
the
court
of
military
appeals
from
this
court.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
well
contrary
to
what
mr.
weisl
said
and
so
far
as
i
read
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
their
jurisdiction
over
matters
such
as
this
is
discretionary
above
the
limit
that
mr.
weisl
posed.
that
is
to
say
if
there
is
a
fine
of
a
certain
amount
or
dismal,
then
they
have
discretionary
jurisdiction,
they
don't
have
to
take
the
case
and
in
this
case
they
did
not.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
their
discretion
here
and
they
did
not
need
to
--
they
deemed
not
to
exercise
their
discretion.
but
the
real
key
to
this
mr.
justice
white
is
not
really
where
you
can
go
the
court
of
military
appeals
where
the
constitutional
rights
of
servicemen
can
be
the
final
arbiter
of
these
constitutional
rights
is
this
court.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
in
this
case?
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
mr.
justice
marshall
we're
talking
in
this
case
about
the
constitutional
right
to
preparing
adequate
defense
against
impropriety
that
it
spreads
throughout
this
record.
now
this
record,
on
this
face
it
involves
four
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
the
denial
of
due
process
here
is
the
depravation
of
the
right
of
the
defense
through
statutory
rights
that
he's
been
granted
to
prepare
a
defense
against
impropriety
that
is
right
from
this
record.
and
if
i
can
recite
the
facts,
after
all
due
process
as
it
seems
to
me
a
visceral
reaction
to
facts
and
the
facts
of
this
case
are
as
follows.
in
this
case
you
had
--
you
had
first
a
sex
offense
in
which
it's
a
private
offense
in
which
the
word
of
the
participants
are
the
--
or
the
only
things
that
can
give
the
light
to
the
accusation.
you
had
secondly
the
chief
accuser,
the
accuser
whose
evidence
was
the
controlling
evidence
in
the
conviction
here
interviewed
immediately
after
the
arrest
by
agents
of
the
office
of
naval
intelligence.
prior
to
this
interview
this
chief
and
controlling
witness,
this
partner
in
this
alleged
crime
had
any
participation
in
it
by
him
and
by
the
defendant.
after
the
interview
he
changed
his
story
and
claim
that
there
was
a
sex
act,
that
he
participated
in
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
court
of
military
appeals?
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
i
think
if
could
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
i
think
that's
correct
sir.
if
i
can
deal
with
them
in
just
that
order
and
get
back
to
it
mr.
justice
marshall's
question,
because
i
think
it's
important
to
deal
with
the
facts
as
they
really
were
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
no
sir,
he
was
used
--
it
doesn't
go
to
credibility,
what
it
does
do
is
that
it
goes
to
the
question
of
impropriety
on
the
part
of
the
prosecution
and
arranging
for
the
testimony
of
this
key
witness.
the
one
fact
that
i
didn't
add,
which
is
quite
compelling
in
this
case
is
that
after
this
change
of
story
which
took
place
during
this
interview,
this
airman
was
promised
an
honorable
discharge
and
its
so
stated
in
the
record.
but
he
was
not
given
this
discharge.
this
discharge
was
kept
hanging
over
his
head
through
nine
months
and
through
two
trials
and
only
after
he
testified
against
the
commander
with
a
testimony
that
he
had
changed
during
this
interview,
was
he
then
grated
this
honorable
discharge.
he
wasn't
punished
at
all,
although
under
the
laws
of
the
military
he
was
at
least
pari
delicto
with
the
defendant
here.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
no,
i
think
it
goes,
mr.
chief
justice
to
a
point
beyond
credibility.
it
goes
to
the
question
of
impropriety,
it
goes
to
the
question
of
the
ability
of
the
defendant
to
raise
a
defense
against
the
chief
witness
against
him.
the
violations
here,
against
which
all
the
facts
that
i've
just
recited
must
be
arranged
as
a
backdrop.
the
violation
here
were
violations
of
the
jencks
act.
a
tape
was
taken
of
this
key
interview
two
hours
afterwards,
during
which
time
this
witness
changed
his
story,
this
sole
witness
of
this
very
grave
crime.
and
it
was
this
tape
that
was
admittedly
taken
that
was
denied
to
the
defendant
and
it
was
notes
taken
by
the
interrogator.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
it
was
never
denied
that
it
was
in
existence
at
the
time
it
was
made
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
you're
quite
correct
it
was
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
that
quite
correct
there
was
dispute--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
that
question
of
fact
was
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
that
is
a
question
of
fact
clearly.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
it
is
in
this
case
for
the
following
reason.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
no,
certainly
not,
the
facts
can
very
often
and
most
often
not
be,
but
in
this
case
the
resolution
of
this
problem
by
the
navy
was
to
put
the
burden
of
proof
of
bad
faith
on
the
government
in
losing
this
tape
or
in
destroying
it
on
the
defendant.
this
obligation
for
production
is
the
government's
obligation.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
by
itself
sir
it
doesn't
deal
with
any
constitutional
section
at
all
that's
a
violation.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
no
sir
these
are
questions
of
law,
every
one
of
them,
these
are
questions
of
law
and
the
administration
of
the
jencks
act
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
judge
davis,
speaking
from
unanimous
court
below
said
that
it's
obvious
that
in
all
cases
jencks
act
violation
are
not
violations
of
the
constitution
and
we
adhere
to
that
position,
but
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
with
the
navy
dealing
with
the
absence
of
these
key
jencks
materials
by
placing
the
burden
on
the
defendant
to
prove
good
faith
or
to
prove
bad
faith
rather
than
the
government.
a
defendant
who
is
powerless
to
prove
any
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
the,
on
the
part
of
the
government,
when
the
government
has
the
obligation
to
produce
that
rule
of
law
sir
is
a
rule
of
law
that
is
reviewable
and
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
that's
quite
true
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
that's
quite
true
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
and
it's
quite
true,
but
that
navy's
the
exoneration
of
the
government's
obligation
to
produce
these
tapes,
which
were
obviously,
which
were
in
the
navy's
hands,
which
were
hand
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
well,
the
navy
was
--
the
individual
who
took
the
tape
was
last
one
who
the
record
shows
have
the
tapes
and
he
was
one
in
whose
hands
the
tape
disappeared.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
and
the
one
is
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
there
is
certainly
evidence
to
that
effect
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
there
is
certainly
evidence
to
that
effect,
but
there
is
also
evidence
that
this
was
in
violation
of
the
navy's
owns
policies
and
regulations
with
regard
to
jencks
materials.
there
is
further
testimony
that
the
last
person
that
had
this
tape
was
the
same
person
that
was
in
this
interview
that
denied
for
at
least
12
pages
of
testimony
that
this
tape
never
had
been
taken
and
then
it's
given
into
his
hands
by
superior
officer
and
from
his
hands
had
disappeared.
and
then
the
navy
justifies
this
conduct
by
saying
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
defendants
to
show
that
the
navy
was
in
bad
faith.
that
sir
is
a
rule
of
law,
that
sir
is
--
it
raises
on
the
factual
pattern
to
this
case
a
constitutional
question,
not
as
the
jencks
act.
there
is
a
right
of
the
defendant
to
raise
the
defense
as
impropriety
on
the
facts
of
this
case
and
no
further.
now
if
i
can
go
back
to
the
question
that
was
raised
by
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
think
that
--
we
have
to
look
at
the
background
of
the
enactment
of
article
76.
article
76
is
word
for
word
of
article
50
h
article
of
war
50
h
and
act
of
1948.
this
as
we
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
page
61
came
as
a
result
of
the
post
war
reforms
of
the
articles
of
war.
contrary
to
any
attempt
trying
to
eliminate
rights
of
servicemen
the
vanderbilt
report
which
gave
rise
to
the
kim
elston
amendments
in
1948
had
as
it
point
the
enlargement
and
the
protection
of
servicemen
and
the
vanderbilt
report
indicated
that
the
point
of
the
van
article
50
h
which
became
word
for
word
article
76
is
to
indicate
at
what
point
inside
the
military
establishment
these
judgments
becomes
final,
that
is
to
say
that
they
are
impervious
to
command
control.
they
can't
be
set
aside
by
commanding
officers
deciding
they
don't
like
to
resolve
this
court
martial
and
trying
by
another
court.
that
was
point
of
article
76
and
it
was
a
point
articulated
by
judge
vanderbilt
in
the
vanderbilt
report,
there
was
not
a
word
said
about
the
court
of
claims.
there
was
not
a
word
said
about
civilian
review
in
all
of
the
deliberations
that
gave
rise
to
kim
elston
amendments.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
yes
sir,
that
is
because
i
think.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
well,
we
--
the
point
of
that
is
as
far
as
i
can
see
there
were
some,
there
are
very
many
muddy
things
about
this,
but
there
is
about
the
legislative
history
in
this,
the
point
of
that
as
far
as
i
can
see
is
the
elimination
of
command
control
in
the
first
place
to
indicate
where
the
cutting
off
point
of
military
procedures
are
as
it
was
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
courts,
yes
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
i
believe
the
meaning
of
that
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
well,
i
believe
that
what
they
had
to
do
with
that
in
a
situation
such
as
this
where
you
had
the
--
where
you
had
a
court-martial
determination
that
the
civilian,
the
federal
civilian
courts,
which
is
all
that
could
be
ruled
upon
here
could
not
under
those
circumstances
try
to
service
him
for
the
same
crime.
i
think
it
had
that
effect
which
is
wholly
apart
from
anything
we
are
talking
about
here.
now
there
is
some
legislative
history
to
that
effect
mr.
justice
brennan
but
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
collateral
views
these
matters
for
constitutional,
for
constitutional
errors.
now
i
would
point
that
when
i
say
that
everything
that
the
government
says
today
here
is
based
on
silence
i
mean
silence
because
i
think
that
the
article
50
h
aimed
at
the
elimination
of
command
control,
aimed
at
picking
a
point
of
time
at
which
military
remedies
were
exhausted
so
that
you
could
then
go
to
the
civilian
remedies
and
in
1948
when
the
kim
elston
amendments
came
into
being
which
became
article
76
two
years
later
there
isn't
a
single
word
about
the
elimination
of
the
traditional
courts
of
claims
remedy
for
back
pay,
not
one
word
anywhere
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
oh,
i
think
that's
clear
the
court
of
claims
is
not
an
ordinary
appellate
review
of
military
court-martial
under
no
circumstances.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
i
would
very
hardly
agree
with
that
sir,
that
unless
you
have
rules
of
law
that
come
to
this
court
as
rules
of
law
and
don't
involve
any
resifting
of
the
evidence,
which
this
court
very
specifically
proscribed
in
burns
versus
wilson
then
you
don't
have
any
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
claims,
but
you
do
have
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
claims
where
you
have
rules
of
law
such
as
you
have
in
this
case,
such
as
you,
the
putting
of
the
burden
for
showing
bad
faith
in
the
destruction
of
the
jencks
materials
or
the
negligent
loss
of
that
material
on
the
defendant,
such
as
the
failure
to
conduct
an
in
camera
examination
of
the
notes
taken
during
this
key
interview,
such
as
the
failure
to
call
the
key
witness
to
testify
as
to
what
happened,
the
witness
who
denied
of
taking
this
tapes
and
the
witness
in
whose
hands
this
tape
disappeared,
failure
to
call
him,
these
are
rules
of
law.
these
are
not
--
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
facts,
they
dot
no
require
any
shifting
of
the
evidence
by
the
court
of
claims
or
by
any
court.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
oh,
absolutely
not,
no
we
are
not
our
position
is
not.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
what
we
are
saying
here
sir
is
that
exactly
right,
that
the
jencks
deprivation
is
that,
the
right
as
this
court
annunciated
in
all
the
cases
in
johnson
versus
zerbst
court
filed
through
the
most
recent
one
through
the
giles
case
and
all
the
case
right
down
the
line,
that
a
defendant
is
entitled
to
a
trial
free
from
impropriety
is
meaningless
tool
unless
the
rights
guaranteed
him
by
statute
exist
to
him
to
enquire
into
that
impropriety
and
the
right
to
enquire
into
that
impropriety
where
the
impropriety
is
on
the
record
as
it
is
in
this
case,
is
coextensive
and
vindictive
with
his
right
to
a
trail
free
from
that,
that
impropriety.
now
i
would
go,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
on
the
very
day,
that
the
very
next
day
rather,
june
25th
1948
the
kim
elston
act
passed
article
50
h,
which
is
in
haec
verba
where
the
article
76
exactly
the
same.
the
tucker
act
was
reenacted
by
the
congress
intact
--
that's
the
best
jurisdiction
recorded
claims
to
do
just
what
did
the
augenblick
case
and
it
was
reenacted
with
considerable
legislative
history
and
there
isn't
one
word
on
a
major
excision
of
one
of
the
functions
of
the
court
of
claims
in
that
history.
although
five
years
later,
when
the
court
of
claims
when
the
tuckers
act
was
again
reenacted
and
a
portion
of
its
jurisdiction
excised
it
was
done
in
unmistakable
terms.
in
1953
the
court
of
claims
act
was
–-
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
the
congress
could
not
have
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
mr.
justice
brennan
that
raises
one
of
the
great,
great
questions
of
constitutional
law
that
i
think
is
presently
unresolved.
i
think
that
there
is
grave
doubt
that
the
congress
could
have
told
service
men
who
have
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
i
think
that
congress
that
there
is
some
large
question
of
constitutionality
as
to
whether
congress
can
do
that,
and
i
said
so
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
oh,
yes,
they
readily
do
that,
the
question
is
whether
congress
could
take
servicemen
who
have
acknowledged
constitutional
rights,
this
court
has
articulated
in
burns
versus
wilson.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
yes
sir.
but
and
i,
and
my
answer
has
to
involve
the
question,
constitutional
rights
of
serviceman,
the
congress
certainly
could
do
that
sir.
but
congress,
i
don't
think
can
take
a
group
of
american
citizens
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
we
say
this
in
our
brief,
we
stand
by
it
sir.
the
reason
being
that
here
you
have
constitutional
rights
of
serviceman,
so
articulated
by
this
court
clearly
in
burns
versus
wilson.
we
have
no
article
3
court
to
go
to,
to
protect
those
rights.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
no
sir,
burns
is
habeas
corpus,
but
burns
articulated
constitutional
rights
mr.
justice
marshall
and
my
point
is
that
if
there
are
constitutional
rights,
then
they
are
meaningless
unless
there
is
a
court
to
protect
them
and
in
article
i
court
such
as
court
of
military
appeals
which
had
none
of
the
attributes
of
an
article
iii
court
which
has,
well
i
think
the
selling
substance
is
that
the
supreme
court
is
and
should
remain
the
final
arbiter
--
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
servicemen.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
no
sir,
i
do
not
i
want
you
to
--
i
want
this
court
simply
to
view
the
legislative
history
as
i
believe
its
properly
viewed
and
that
is
not
in
anyway
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
no
sir.
no
i
am
saying
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
because
the
only
way
under
the
circumstances
that
commander
augenblick
could
get
in
this
court
is
sue
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
no
sir
cannot,
they
cannot
not
by
direct
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
no
sir,
they
are
not,
because
i
am
saying
that
in
order
to
accept
a
government
position
you
have
to,
you
have
to
state
that
the
place
that
the
commander
did
go
to
him,
the
court
of
claims
has
denied
him.
his
only
--
the
reason
that
he
would
have
no
review
would
be
that
he
was
cut
off
in
the
court
of
claims
review,
that
its
his
only
avenue
to
come
here.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
my
point
was
that
the,
our
(inaudible)
of
constitutionality
of
serviceman
should
be
the
supreme
court
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
i
don't
sir,
i
don't
find
it
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
i
don't
find
it
in
the
constitution
but
i
do
believe
that
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
if
they
had
said
that
the
question
would
have
been
posed
squarely
and
it
hasn't
said
that
and
i
think
until
it
does
this
court
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
no
sir,
but
i
can
give
you
a
long
line
of
cases
where
this
court
is
strained
in
every
circumstance
to
find
judicial
review
in
a
situation
where
congress
has
purported
to
grant
finality
to
an
administrative
agency.
starting
with
carlebach
(ph)
and
after
the
civil
war
and
going
right
through
yakes
(ph)
through
all
of
these
cases
where
this
court
looking
at
ambiguous
congressional
enactments
has
always
attempted
to
find
some
review,
now
it's
turned
other
way
around
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
he
is
out
in
prison
sir?
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
oh
and
those
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
no,
i
don't,
if
he
had
been
denied
back
pay
i
believe
that
if
he
falls
within
the
jurisdictional
limits.
i'd
say
that
he'd
be
entitled
that.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
no
sir,
no
because
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
he
would
have
to
show
exactly
what
judge
davis
and
unanimous
court
found
below
that
the
record
supported
a
finding
of
unconstitutionality
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
then
i
think
you
have
a
case
exactly
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
i
believe
under
those
circumstances
that
the
court
of
claims
jurisdiction
for
back
pay
still
exists
and
that
case
it
would
be
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
well
army
discipline
sir
is
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
well
army
discipline
sir
is

mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
well
army
discipline
is
always
involved
in
these
matters,
when
army,
army
prosecutions
are
conducted
irregularly.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
i
don't
think
constitutionality
of
court-martials
turns
on
whether
a
man
is
out
or
in
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
well
discipline
and
unconstitutionality
are
two
different
things
and
this
court
has
said
so.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
absolutely
not
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
no
sir,
not
even
close,
miles
apart,
miles
apart
because
i
might
point
out
that
twice
in
17
years
the
court
of
claims
has
exercised
its
jurisdiction
and
in
the
augenblick
case
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
well
i
might
point
out
that
there
has
been
no
flood
in
the
court
of
claims
and
there
won't
be
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
well
now,
i
think
the
number
there
would
at
least
eight
times,
at
least
seven
times,
mr.
justice
marshall
where
these
cases
were
taken
to
the
court
of
claims,
where
the
court
of
claims
went
through
the
exercise
that
the
government
now
says
was
forbidden
to
of
looking
at
the
merits
assume
jurisdiction
looked
at
the
merits
and
denied
the
relief
on
grounds
that
there
wasn't
any
constitutional
exercise
so
that
if
there
were
any
clubhouse
for
barracks
and
lawyers
they
have
always
existed
and
it
hasn't
been
the
language
of
the
article
76,
that's
inhibited
this
review,
it's
been
the
restraint
of
the
court
of
claims.
the
court
of
claims
is
looking,
was
it
looking,
but
it
was
waiting
until
it
was
faced
with
a
proper
record
and
it
didn't
act
until
it
was
faced
with
a
proper
record.
now
if
this
man,
if
this
man
is
denied
review
by
the
court
of
claims
then
among
the
various
consequences
the
jencks
act
can
be
forgotten
in
the
military
because
the
military,
the
rule
of
law
that
will
apply
on
the
military
is
that
anytime
the
prosecution
has
jencks
material
he
doesn't
want
to
turn
over
to
the
defendant
then
he
just
doesn't
turn
it
over
and
hopes
the
defendant
can't
prove
that
he
didn't
destroy
it.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
that's
correct
sir,
that's
correct.
now
that
is
the
case
--
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
no
but
as
mr.
weisl
pointed
out
that
there
is
an
additional
quantum
of,
well
of
rejection
that's
involved
in
the
c.m.a's
turning
down
a
case
simply
much
more
than
this
court
simply
turning
down
a
case
and
i
would
point
out
that
in
the
board
of
review,
the
board
of
review's
opinion
which
deals
with
this
case
that
the
law,
the
law
now
is
as
the
law
from
the
military
since
this
went
to
the
court
of
military
appeals
and
there
was
no
review
of
this
determination
on
jencks,
is
that
the
burden,
the
clear
burden
and
they
couldn't
be
clear,
it's
in
the
record
here.
the
clear
burden
falls
on
the
defendant
to
prove
bad
faith.
now
that
has
never
been
ruled
on,
that
point
have
never
before
been
ruled
on
by
the
c.m.a.
so
that
that
apparently
is
law
of
the
military
unless
this
court
does
something
about
it.
now,
this
is
court
is
not
sitting
in
a
supervisory
role
over
the
c.m.a.,
i'm
not
pointing
that
out.
but
i'm
pointing
out
is
one
of
the
necessary
consequences
of
this
court's
dealing
with
what
is
a
clear
constitutional
question
in
terms
of
this
man's
right
to
defend
himself
would
be
the
therapeutic
effect
on
the
military
of
this
complete
misconception
of
jencks
rights
and
it
went
not
only
to
one
point
but
it
went
to
four
points.
it
went
to
the
burden
approved
being
put
on
the
wrong
party
when
a
jencks
material
is
not
produced,
the
failure
to
conduct
in
a
camera
examination
of
admitted
notes,
admitted
jencks
materials,
the
failure
to
incorporate
those
notes
into
the
record
so
that
anybody
the
court
of
military
appeals
or
anybody
else
could
review
it
and
a
failure
to
call
a
key
witness
to
determine
what
happened
to
these
states.
the
witness
that
denied,
it
was
taken
on
the
witness
in
whose
hands
it
disappeared.
under
circumstances
that
are
most
incriminating.
mr.
joseph
h.
sharlitt
yes
sir,
it
would.
because
the
reason
that
the
sole
way
to
come
--
again
the
sole
way
to
determine
the
constitutionality
of
this
action
would
be
in
this
court
and
the
only
way
that
the
commander
could
to
this
court
would
then
be
through
the
court
of
claims
under
those
circumstances
the
rule
was,
the
scope
of
civilian
review
as
enunciated
in
burns
versus
wilson
is
whether
fair
consideration
has
been
given.
now
some
consideration
is
not
fair
consideration,
and
when
rules
of
law
are
completely
misstated,
i
don't
believe
that
any
court
would
determine
that
this
is
fair
consideration
and
i
would
say
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
constitutional
issue
has
been
raised
in
these
jencks
act
violations,
that
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
the
court
of
claims
neither
in
1948
or
1950
was
exercised
in
this
jurisdiction,
nothing
was
said
about
them
and
point
of
fact
the
only
thing
was
said
what
to
the
effect
--
was
to
the
effect
in
a
report
that
was
filed
in
the
congressional
record
that
the
court
of
claims
jurisdiction
remained
and
under
those
circumstances
this
court
cannot
deprive
servicemen
of
the
right
to
come
to
this
court
by
silence
and
by
implication.
