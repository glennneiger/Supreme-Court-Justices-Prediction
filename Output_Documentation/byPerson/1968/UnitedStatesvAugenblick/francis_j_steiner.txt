mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
martial
of
the
respondent
kenneth
n.
juhl
was
fundamentally
unfair.
the
testimony
against
him
was
by
a
man
named
hughes,
was
an
accomplice.
hughes's
testimony
was
an
admitted
perjury,
he
had
been
engaged
in
black-marketing
for
years.
he
was
tried
himself,
sentenced
and
convicted.
then
he
was
approached
and
he
was
told
that
unless
you
testify
implicate
juhl,
we're
going
to
retry
you
on
other
charges
and
you'll
get
five
years
imprisonment
and
a
dishonorable
discharge.
he
had
a
foreign
wife
this
would
also
--
prevented
him
from
bringing
his
wife
back
to
this
country.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
your
honor,
appendix
iii,
pages
362
and
363
is
an
affidavit
of
an
air
policeman
who
had
custody.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
no,
this
is
an
affidavit
in
the
board
of
correction
proceedings
your
honor.
this
affidavit
of
this
technical
sergeant
who
was
an
air
policeman,
who
had
custody
of
juhl
and
he
stated
that
these
facts
were
told
to
him.
and
this
is
controverted.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
not
of
the
court-martial
your
honor,
it
was
an
affidavit
submitted
to
the
correction
board,
but
it's
part
of
this
trial
and
part
of
this
record
your
honor.
the
other
facts
which
are
part
of
this
trial
show
that
after
he
agreed
to
implicate
juhl,
he
was
given
special
privileges,
he
was
given
easy
work,
he
was
given
permission
at
night
to
go
to
movies
with
this
wife
and
to
watch
television
with
his
wife
and
he
was
given
christmas
leave,
this
is
while
he
was
serving
a
sentence
he
never
left
the
base
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
well,
your
honor
that
he
testified
against
juhl
that's
what
i
meant--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
as
a
prosecution
witness
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
for
the
prosecution,
as
a
prosecution
witness.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
not
that
alone
your
honor
but
when
combined
with
all
of
these
facts
of
this
case,
his
testimony
was
replete
within
inconsistencies,
with
self
contradiction.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
i
think
that
--
well
i
interpreted
that
as
a
prosecution
witness
and
it
maybe
a
little
more
of
an
interpretation
of
it.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes
your
honor
but
combined
with
all
of
these
facts
and
the
inconsistencies
and
self
contradictions
under
oath
in
his
testimony,
it
was
totally
unreliable.
i
think
these
facts
alone
were
sufficient
to
raise
a
constitutional
question
of
whether
he
had
a
fair
trial
and
i
do
not
believe
he
had
a
fair
trial
with
untampered
witnesses,
when
this
type
pressure
was
put
upon
a
man
of
hughes'
character
that
would
have
a
fair
witness
who
would
come
in.
this
man
hughes
would
have
said
anything
--
if
you
look
at
his
past
record,
if
you
look
at
his
testimony
under
oath.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
well,
your
honor
the
closest
to
it
--
one
is
he
denied
all
these
things
but
in
this
hearing,
you
could
say
this
time
he's
telling
the
truth,
but
in
the
article
32
proceedings,
which
is
also
part
of
these
records,
the
discovery
records,
they're
asking,
would
you
lie
under
oath,
would
you
lie
under
oath,
and
like
he
said
yes
that's
part
of
the
record
to
that
--
now
whether
he's
telling
the
truth
this
time
or
not,
but
the
inconsistencies
and
improbabilities
in
his
testimonies
make
it
look
that
all
the
pages
are
fraud.
he
says
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
it
does
but
when
you
get
so
many
of
them
i
think
it
comes
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
just
on
credibility
but
you
also
get
a
statistical
impossibility
when
there
are
so
many
of
these
inconsistencies.
so
many
of
the
things
he
puts
up
to
implicate
this
to
juhl.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
well,
it's
still
the
fact
that
he's
also
testified
on
these
very
same
facts
under
oath
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
but
your
honor
we
have
a
provision
here
which
covers
under
the
manual
itself,
i
think
that
alone
is
enough
regardless
of
section
76
but
if
it's
not,
the
manual
for
court-martials
provide
in
section
153
(a)
and
this
is
an
instruction
to
the
court-martial
panel,
you
cannot
face
a
conviction
upon
the
un-corroborated
testimony
of
an
accomplice,
if
that
testimony
is
self-contradictory,
uncertain
or
improbable.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
i
think,
not
that
court
necessarily
your
honor,
if
the
record
shows
that
no
other
conclusion
can
be
reached,
if
you
have
a
jury
trial.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
i've
got
the
assurance
of
the
--
it's
not
just
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses,
it's
the
question
of
all
these
facts
showing
that
no
other
conclusion
can
be
reached
then
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
he
is.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
in
the
air
force.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
no,
your
--
not
--
when
it
conflicts
with
the
constitutional
right
of
a
fair
trial.
and
i
don't
think
he
got
this
here
and
i
think
they
violated
section
153a
which
tells
them
the
court-martial
panel
itself
you
cannot
base
a
conviction
upon
the
uncooperated
testimony
of
an
accomplice
where
that
testimony
is
uncertain
or
improper.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
no,
no
i
don't
believe
it
is
your
honor,
not
at
all.
this
is
the
statement
through
the
court-martial
panel.
this
was
in
the
manual
for
court-martials
which
was
by
executive
order
and
referred
back
to
congress
for
approval.
this
is
what
the
court-martial
can
do
and
this
is
where
it
cannot
convict.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
well
yes,
your
honor.
but
when
their
testimony
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
your
honor,
if
the
facts
were
the
same
as
this
i
would
say
yes,
i
would
say
with
all
of
the
self
contradictions
and
the
improbabilities
in
his
testimony,
if
that
was
the
only
evidence,
it
wouldn't
be
sufficient
to
convict.
if
that
where
the
only
--
based
upon
the
facts
of
this
case,
with
the
contradictions
that
we
have
in
his
own
testimony,
where
the
man
you
cannot
read
this
record.
from
back
to
the
front
and
not
conclude
that
the
man
was
lying,
i
do
not
believe.
and
where
that
is
there
can
be
no
reasonable
doubt
about
it.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
none
that
would
tie
him
--
this
is
not
corroborated,
there
is
other
testimony.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
nothing
that
would
corroborate
him,
your
honor.
i
do
not
believe.
now
this
is
--
this
may
be
a
judgment.
also
again,
i
believe
reading
the
record
that
not
--
this
is
not
controverting
fact,
that
is
where
what
does
this
really,
but
just
the
only
conclusion
you
can
reach,
the
only
conclusion
you
can
reach,
is
that
it's
not
corroborative.
there
is
no
one
--
for
example,
they
have
the
sales
girls,
he
said
the
government
stated
that
it
was
corroborated
by
them
and
he
purchased
unusual
amounts.
the
sales
girl
said
he
did
not
purchase
that
this
is
--
whether
it
was
--
irregular
amounts
or
excessive
amount.
and
they
said
no,
he
purchased
what
was
normal
and
he
purchased
large
amounts
but
never
in
excess
of
his
rights.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
she
testified
to
that.
she
didn't
say
she
did
that
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
oh,
yes
your
honor
they
are.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
no,
your
honor
this
--
she
said
that
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
she
did
--
she
said
she
did
this
for
some
people,
but
again
this
is
another.
this
is
really
the
key
to
this
whole
case.
this
is
the
reason
the
air
force
convicted
him.
this
is
the
reason,
they
seized
this
ration
card
illegally
from
him,
which
obviously
has
marks
over,
where
he
purchased
more
than
the
normal
amount.
this
was
seized
illegally
and
it
was
not
used
at
the
court-martial.
but
the
government
had
used
it
every
sense,
including
the
reply
to
this
brief.
now
i
asked
my
client
about
this,
and
he
said
that
this
--
these
things
were
old
on
his
card,
what
they
did,
they
called
him
in
and
ordered
him
to
produce
it.
he
said
they
were
old
and
i
wondered
about
that
when
i
went
to
prison
i
took
my
other
card
that
i
had
up
there
and
i
gave
it
--
i
had
it
stamped,
cut
and
when
i
happened
to
ask
curt
and
sure
enough
he
sent
me
his
card
which
is
in
evidence.
where
it
shows
where
they
cut
his
and
it
didn't
cut
it
out
all
together.
in
other
words
it
was
necessary
to
do
it
twice,
is
that
true,
i
don't
know.
but
the
thing
is
that
was
seized
illegally,
it
was
not
part
of
that
trial,
there
was
no
way
for
him
to
defend
it,
but
that
is
the
very
reason,
that
is
the
very
reason
that
this
man
has
been
convicted
and
put
where
he
is
now
and
they
had
refused
to
do
anything
about
it.
and
it
was
illegally
seized
and
it's
something
that
should
never
have
been
brought
up
and
if
it
should
have
been,
it
should
have
been
taken
properly
and
he
should
have
a
right
to
explain
it,
which
he
did
have
an
explanation.
and
there
was
no
question
about
it
being
seized
illegally,
the
government
admits
that
and
it
was
not
used
at
the
court-martial.
but
even
then
there
is
no
where
comparable
that
the
--
what
they
charged
him
with
and
what
they
tried
him
with
he
was
not
guilty
of,
it
was
clear
fabrication.
the
government
argues
on
habeas
corpus
that
is
more
limit
than
what
this
court
has
defined
habeas
corpus
to
be.
this
man
is
still
in
the
service.every
time
his
file
jacket
is
open
this
conviction
is
part
of
that.
every
time
he
comes
up
for
promotion
and
every
time
he
is
considered
for
any
job,
this
is
all
part
of
it.
and
under
the
recent
case
of
carafas
v.
lavallee,
the
court
defined
habeas
corpus.
the
government's
initial
brief
was
that
well
he
wasn't
in
confinement,
but
this
man
was
in
confinement,
he
was
out
and
it's
a
restraint
that
still
follow.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
well,
your
honor
the
same
rules
would
apply.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
we
are
not
seeking
the
relief,
but
i
believe
the
same
principle
applies.
he
is
seeking
something
that
is
due
him
and
the
same
theory
of
habeas
corpus
should
apply.
now
this
is
a
man
who
was
confined,
these
are
restraints
that
still
follow
him.
this
perfectly
qualified
as
a
habeas
corpus
action,
that
he
still
has
a
restraint
on
him
because
of
this
conviction.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
he
has
the
right
to
his
back
pay,
under
the
court
of
claims
jurisdiction.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
under
the
constitution.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
no,
your
honor
they
cannot.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
but
as
a
practical
man
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
no,
your
honor
he
has
been
constitutionally
deprived
of
his
property
and
even
if
it's
a
smaller
amount
he's
still
being
deprived
of
it,
and
the
court
of
claims
has
jurisdiction
to
rule
upon
that,
on
his
constitutional
deprivation
of
salary.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
well,
your
honor
i
do
not
believe
it's
the
equivalent
of
that
in
the
first
place.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
but
when
this
happens
and
i
know
of
no
case
otherwise,
the
correction
board,
when
this
decision
becomes
final
in
effect
corrects
the
record
on
application
based
upon
that
decision
and
i
haven't
heard
of
any
decision
where
it
was
otherwise.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
i'll
do
that
as
soon
as
this
decision
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
they
denied
it
and
this
is
another
basis
for
jurisdiction.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
no
your
honor.
well
i
am
yes,
i
am
questioning
that
opinion.
in
my
brief,
i
say
this
is
another
basis
for
jurisdiction.
in
the
first
place,
one
under
the
correction
statute
the
secretary
can
attack
a
court-martial.
in
other
words
section
76
of
the
finality
clause
says
that
these
--
this
decision
on
a
court-martial
will
be
final
on
all
officers.
but
then
they
come
along
with
the
correction
statute
where
the
secretary
wants
to
correct
them
to
save
congress
from
making
private
bills.
so
the
mr.
francis
j.
steiner
general
rules
and
the
government
agree
the
secretary
can
than
collaterally
attack
the
court-martial.
the
secretary
can
do
that.
now
the
decision
of
the
secretary
is
just
final
on
officers,
it's
not
final
on
courts.
all
the
decisions
of
the
secretary
under
the
correction
board
can
be
reviewed
by
the
court
of
claims.
there
is
no
basis
in
the
legislative
history
or
any
other
thing
to
show
that
they
could
not
review
a
court-martial.
nowhere
does
it
say
that
and
the
government
admits
that
the
secretary
can
collaterally
attack
it,
that's
an
exception
to
section
76.
and
the
statute
under
which
he
does
it
is
only
final
on
officers,
it's
not
final
on
courts.
so
under
the
correction
statute
he
has
a
right
to
be
reviewed
in
the
court
of
claims
under
this,
nowhere
does
it
say
otherwise.
but
even
the
section
76
found,
and
i
believe
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
estep
versus
u.s.
and
the
harmon
v.
brucker
case,
we
had
other
statutes
which
had
finality
provisions
in
them,
there
was
a
finality
provision
in
the
law.
and
the
court
looked
at
this
in
effect
as
a
final
legal
order.
they
can
make
a
final
legal
order,
they
don't
consider
all
orders
final,
just
only
the
final
legal
order.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
no
your
honor.
this
is
another
thing.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
he
had
no
appeal,
he
could
not
take
it
up,
he
could
not
even
ask
him
to
review
it.
there
was
no
appeal
whatsoever.
the
one
man
that
reviewed
it
was
in
the
convening
authority
who
was
a
staff
judge
advocate,
who
was
a
military
lawyer.
he
is
also
the
same
man
who
reviewed
the
specifications
and
advised
suit
to
be
filed
and
advised
on
the
wording
of
them.
in
other
words,
the
only
review
was
by
the
prosecutor
in
effect,
this
--
just
this
court-martial
itself
there
was
nowhere
he
could
go.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
that's
right
your
honor,
not
even
to
consider
whether
they
would
review
it.
there
was
nothing
he
could
do.
no
where
to
go,
this
was
the
only
court
that
could
possibly
consider
his
constitutional
claims.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
if
it's
a
constitutional
depravation,
i
believe
under
like
thompson
versus
city
of
louisville
where
we
had
a
$20
fine.
this
was
constitutional;
this
was
taken
away
from
him
constitutionally.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
here
there
was
no
way,
no
review
he
had
at
all.
this
is
not
a
question
on
corroboration
for
example
of
any
controverted
facts,
the
record
has
to
be
read.
but
the
record
as
read
shows
this
constitutional
depravation
that
it
was
not
corroborated.
it
also
was
not
waived
as,
if
it's
jurisdictional,
which
i
believe
that
it
is
under
this
153a.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
the
board
for
the
correction
of
military
record
is
the
only
thing
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
1552a

u.s.c.
--
10
u.s.c
excuse
me.
1552
a.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
your
honor,
there
the
secretary
has
given
the
authority
to
review,
to
correct
any
record
point
in
justice.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
he
can
do,
he
can
take
a
hearing,
he
gathered
all
the
records
and
he
will
accept
any
evidence
you
have,
affidavits
or
he
can
also
hold
a
hearing,
many
times
it's
just
decided
just
upon
the
record.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
of
the
exact
procedure
--
they
do
have
someone
over
here
who
does
this
work,
who
reviews
it,
and
says
this
is
what
can
be
done.
the
statute
reads
the
secretary
of
a
military
department
under
procedures
established
by
him
and
approved
by
the
secretary
of
defense
and
acting
through
boards
of
civilians
of
the
executive.
part
of
that
--
acting
through
boards
of
civilians.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
through
the
executive
part
of
that
military
department
may
correct
any
military
record
of
that
department
when
he
considers
it
necessary
to
correct
an
error
or
remove
an
injustice,
and
that
is
then
reviewable
in
the
court
of
claims,
they
considered
in
this
correction
statute
should
we
make
it
final
on
the
courts,
in
the
legislative
history
and
they
didn't,
they
struck
that
out
–
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
they
did
consider
it
and
deny
it.
i
believe
there's
no
limits
whatsoever
i
think
custer's
lieutenant
was
correct.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
no
your
honor,
i
could
review
the
board
of
correction
of
military
records
in
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
because
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
now,
the
government
admits
that
you
can
do
this.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
no
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
the
measurement
is
whether
it's
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
so,
and
i
believe
it's
a
constitutional
deprivation.
here
this
man
could
have
been
sentenced
to
16
years
in
prison
but
this
record
was
so
unreliable
that
even
they
couldn't
believe
it.
what
they
must
have
reacted
on
was
he
was
charged,
so
he
must
be
guilty
so
we're
giving
six
months
and
then
there
is
no
review.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
i
have
two
distinctions,
that's
one
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
i
don't
know
about
augenblick.
there's
something
i
know
that
they
did
not
make
it
an
issue
in
the
court
of
claims
on
whether
that
was
exceeded,
whether
they
had
appealed
under
the
board
of
correction
but
i
hate
to
say
on
augenblick,
on
this
thing.
but
there
are
other
differences,
one
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
this
legislative
history
as
in
ashe
v.
mcnamara
that
they
discuss
it
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
well,
your
honor
the
court
of
claims
has
jurisdiction
under
any
statute
treaty
or
constitution
and
this
would
be
under
a
statute.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
well,
the
pay
statute
and
also
the
correction
board
statute
because
the
secretary
under
the
statute
is
given
authority
to
correct
an
error
or
remove
an
injustice.
if
that
decision
is
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
he
can
then
take
it
to
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
well,
the
correction
statute
and
the
legislative
history
your
honor
and
the
wordings
of
the
two
statutes
section
76.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
know
what
they
say
a
court-martial
specially
be
reviewed,
but
they
have
reviewed,
the
attorney
general
says
the
secretary
can
review
this.
there
is
no
basis
in
the
history
for
distinguishing
between
the
decisions
of
the
secretary.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
yes
your
honor,
they
considered
shall
we
make
this
finding
final
on
the
courts
and
they
struck
it
out,
that's
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
well,
i've
citied
in
ashe
v.
mcnamara
which
has
a
full
discussion
of
it,
which
i've
referred
from
ashe
v.
mcnamara
to
the
legislative
history,
but
in
addition
one
what
the
difference
is
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
in
your
honor
where
--
it's
in
my
brief
that
a
filed
here,
where
i've
citied
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes
that
--
your
honor
on
page
14
of
my
brief,
on
the
second
paragraph
the
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
i've
filed
a
brief,
reply
brief
of
the
respondent
kenneth
n.
juhl.
but
the
two
circuits,
the
two
circuits,
the
first
and
tenth
circuit
have
construed
this
correction
statute
to
give
them
authority
to
review
court-martials
and
ashe
v.
mcnamara
is
one
and
smith
v.
mcnamara
is
the
other.
so
this
and
there
is
no
decision
saying
that
the
courts
cannot
look
into
court-martials
under
the
correction
board
statute.
the
only
case
closest
is
davies
v.
clifford,
which
the
government
citied,
in
which
they
said
that
he
was
--
he
received
full
relief
from
the
secretary
so
we
had
no
claim
under
that.
so
my
main
difference
is
though
that
i
made
with
augenblick
was
the
correction
board
statute,
the
fact
that
there
was
no
review
whatsoever
for
this
man,
not
even
discretionary
and
the
fact
that
this
is
jurisdictional,
this
was
basic
jurisdiction
under
153a.
the
court-martial
cannot
base
the
conviction
upon
the
uncorroborated
testimony
of
an
accomplice,
where
it's
uncertain,
doubtful
or
improbable.
that
was
jurisdiction
that
told
them
what
they
could
do.
those
three
factors
are
the
reasons
that
turn
in.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
i
think
with
any
corroboration
your
honor
that
its
corroboration
but
you
can't
read
just,
for
example
the
testimonies
of
the
people
who
said,
yes
he
was
out
here,
but
he
didn't
engage
in
any
of
this
activity.
in
fact
he
went
around
and
sat
in
the
front
yard
with
my
wife
and
i
was
so
surprised
to
see
him
come
out.
in
other
words,
he
contradicted
hughes
on
everything
that
hughes
said
to
implicate
it,
contradicted
him
on
every
single
factor.
now
that
can't
be
corroboration
just
because
he
was
out
there
and
he
went
around
to
sit
there
in
the
front
yard,
where
his
wife
also
in
a
later
affidavit
says
he
was
in
the
front
yard
the
whole
time.
and
hughes's
testimony
on
that
there
he
said,
once
he
rode
out
there
with
me
and
he
stood
beside
the
car
and
acted
as
a
lookout.
later
at
the
trial,
he
says
he
went
out
into
the
road
down
the
driveway
to
act
as
a
lookout.
he
testified
at
the
article
32,
all
these
cigars
boxes
we
are
sitting
right
on
the
front
seat
where
he
could
see
it.
the
other
man
comes
up
and
says
they
were
in
the
truck
and
there
weren't
anyway
he
could
have
seen.
this
was
the
corroborating
witnesses.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
the
other,
the
other
possible
collaborator,
in
other
words
he
contradicting
on
everything
and
–-
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
no,
your
honor
but
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
but
that
has
to
be
corroborate
--
in
other
words
he
didn't
corroborate
on
any
of
the
criminal
factors
and
hughes
didn't
repeat
that
testimony
at
the
trial.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
this
was
the
article
33.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
hughes,
hughes,
the
name
the
name
of
accomplish,
the
man
we
complain
off.
he
said
they
were
–
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
he
said
they
were
sitting
in
the
front
seat.
now
he
said
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
that's
his
testimony,
his
testimony
has
to
be
corroborating.
he
is
hughes,
he
has
testified
it,
his
testimony
but
he
didn't
repeat
that
at
the
trial
because
(inaudible)
said,
no
it
was
in
the
trunk,
there
weren't
anyway
you
could
have
seen,
but
these
are
just
replete
with
this
through
out
this
record.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes
your
honor
that's
correct.
mr.
francis

jr.

cited
it
on
page

of
my
brief.
10usc
1552(a).
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
well
your
honor
they
say
that
this,
well
this
is
okay
for
the
secretary
to
do
it,
but
it
doesn't,
they
didn't
mean
to
vary
but
there
is
no
provision,
that
they
didn't
mean
that
a
court
could
then
review
it.
but
there
is
no
basis
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
no,
this
is
one
of
my
basic
arguments
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes
your
honor
it
is,
i've
cited.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes
your
honor
it's
quoted.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
on
page

mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
no
your
honor.
but
in
the
legislative
history
they
said
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
will
be
filed
just
on
officers
and
that
they
consider
will
it
be
on
court
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
it
says
officers
and
they
deleted
courts.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
pardon
me
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
you
are
right
on
that,
that
they
have
never
reviewed
a
court-martial
but
two
circuits
have,
two
circuits
have
and
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
well
your
honor
i
think
if
they
were
faced
with
a
case
directly
in
point,
well
that
was
the
only
basis
they
would
construe
it
that
way,
now
that's
just
conjecture
but
they
haven't
ruled
that
i
know,
that
no
this
prohibits
us
from
reviewing
it.
and
the
thing
is,
it
excluded
any
court,
this
is
general
court,
they
didn't
specify
courts
could
and
which
couldn't.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
this
is
the
very
basis
of
the
ashe.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.

these
were

ashe

example
was
not

and
they
didn't
hold
in
its
favor
and
smith,
but
they
ruled
they
had
jurisdiction
in

of
ashe.
mr.
francis
j.

the
secretary
could
do
anything
your
honor
i
believe.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,

yes
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
martial
of
the
respondent
kenneth
n.
juhl
was
fundamentally
unfair.
the
testimony
against
him
was
by
a
man
named
hughes,
was
an
accomplice.
hughes's
testimony
was
an
admitted
perjury,
he
had
been
engaged
in
black-marketing
for
years.
he
was
tried
himself,
sentenced
and
convicted.
then
he
was
approached
and
he
was
told
that
unless
you
testify
implicate
juhl,
we're
going
to
retry
you
on
other
charges
and
you'll
get
five
years
imprisonment
and
a
dishonorable
discharge.
he
had
a
foreign
wife
this
would
also
--
prevented
him
from
bringing
his
wife
back
to
this
country.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
your
honor,
appendix
iii,
pages
362
and
363
is
an
affidavit
of
an
air
policeman
who
had
custody.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
no,
this
is
an
affidavit
in
the
board
of
correction
proceedings
your
honor.
this
affidavit
of
this
technical
sergeant
who
was
an
air
policeman,
who
had
custody
of
juhl
and
he
stated
that
these
facts
were
told
to
him.
and
this
is
controverted.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
not
of
the
court-martial
your
honor,
it
was
an
affidavit
submitted
to
the
correction
board,
but
it's
part
of
this
trial
and
part
of
this
record
your
honor.
the
other
facts
which
are
part
of
this
trial
show
that
after
he
agreed
to
implicate
juhl,
he
was
given
special
privileges,
he
was
given
easy
work,
he
was
given
permission
at
night
to
go
to
movies
with
this
wife
and
to
watch
television
with
his
wife
and
he
was
given
christmas
leave,
this
is
while
he
was
serving
a
sentence
he
never
left
the
base
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
well,
your
honor
that
he
testified
against
juhl
that's
what
i
meant--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
as
a
prosecution
witness
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
for
the
prosecution,
as
a
prosecution
witness.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
not
that
alone
your
honor
but
when
combined
with
all
of
these
facts
of
this
case,
his
testimony
was
replete
within
inconsistencies,
with
self
contradiction.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
i
think
that
--
well
i
interpreted
that
as
a
prosecution
witness
and
it
maybe
a
little
more
of
an
interpretation
of
it.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes
your
honor
but
combined
with
all
of
these
facts
and
the
inconsistencies
and
self
contradictions
under
oath
in
his
testimony,
it
was
totally
unreliable.
i
think
these
facts
alone
were
sufficient
to
raise
a
constitutional
question
of
whether
he
had
a
fair
trial
and
i
do
not
believe
he
had
a
fair
trial
with
untampered
witnesses,
when
this
type
pressure
was
put
upon
a
man
of
hughes'
character
that
would
have
a
fair
witness
who
would
come
in.
this
man
hughes
would
have
said
anything
--
if
you
look
at
his
past
record,
if
you
look
at
his
testimony
under
oath.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
well,
your
honor
the
closest
to
it
--
one
is
he
denied
all
these
things
but
in
this
hearing,
you
could
say
this
time
he's
telling
the
truth,
but
in
the
article
32
proceedings,
which
is
also
part
of
these
records,
the
discovery
records,
they're
asking,
would
you
lie
under
oath,
would
you
lie
under
oath,
and
like
he
said
yes
that's
part
of
the
record
to
that
--
now
whether
he's
telling
the
truth
this
time
or
not,
but
the
inconsistencies
and
improbabilities
in
his
testimonies
make
it
look
that
all
the
pages
are
fraud.
he
says
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
it
does
but
when
you
get
so
many
of
them
i
think
it
comes
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
just
on
credibility
but
you
also
get
a
statistical
impossibility
when
there
are
so
many
of
these
inconsistencies.
so
many
of
the
things
he
puts
up
to
implicate
this
to
juhl.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
well,
it's
still
the
fact
that
he's
also
testified
on
these
very
same
facts
under
oath
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
but
your
honor
we
have
a
provision
here
which
covers
under
the
manual
itself,
i
think
that
alone
is
enough
regardless
of
section
76
but
if
it's
not,
the
manual
for
court-martials
provide
in
section
153
(a)
and
this
is
an
instruction
to
the
court-martial
panel,
you
cannot
face
a
conviction
upon
the
un-corroborated
testimony
of
an
accomplice,
if
that
testimony
is
self-contradictory,
uncertain
or
improbable.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
i
think,
not
that
court
necessarily
your
honor,
if
the
record
shows
that
no
other
conclusion
can
be
reached,
if
you
have
a
jury
trial.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
i've
got
the
assurance
of
the
--
it's
not
just
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses,
it's
the
question
of
all
these
facts
showing
that
no
other
conclusion
can
be
reached
then
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
he
is.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
in
the
air
force.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
no,
your
--
not
--
when
it
conflicts
with
the
constitutional
right
of
a
fair
trial.
and
i
don't
think
he
got
this
here
and
i
think
they
violated
section
153a
which
tells
them
the
court-martial
panel
itself
you
cannot
base
a
conviction
upon
the
uncooperated
testimony
of
an
accomplice
where
that
testimony
is
uncertain
or
improper.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
no,
no
i
don't
believe
it
is
your
honor,
not
at
all.
this
is
the
statement
through
the
court-martial
panel.
this
was
in
the
manual
for
court-martials
which
was
by
executive
order
and
referred
back
to
congress
for
approval.
this
is
what
the
court-martial
can
do
and
this
is
where
it
cannot
convict.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
well
yes,
your
honor.
but
when
their
testimony
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
your
honor,
if
the
facts
were
the
same
as
this
i
would
say
yes,
i
would
say
with
all
of
the
self
contradictions
and
the
improbabilities
in
his
testimony,
if
that
was
the
only
evidence,
it
wouldn't
be
sufficient
to
convict.
if
that
where
the
only
--
based
upon
the
facts
of
this
case,
with
the
contradictions
that
we
have
in
his
own
testimony,
where
the
man
you
cannot
read
this
record.
from
back
to
the
front
and
not
conclude
that
the
man
was
lying,
i
do
not
believe.
and
where
that
is
there
can
be
no
reasonable
doubt
about
it.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
none
that
would
tie
him
--
this
is
not
corroborated,
there
is
other
testimony.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
nothing
that
would
corroborate
him,
your
honor.
i
do
not
believe.
now
this
is
--
this
may
be
a
judgment.
also
again,
i
believe
reading
the
record
that
not
--
this
is
not
controverting
fact,
that
is
where
what
does
this
really,
but
just
the
only
conclusion
you
can
reach,
the
only
conclusion
you
can
reach,
is
that
it's
not
corroborative.
there
is
no
one
--
for
example,
they
have
the
sales
girls,
he
said
the
government
stated
that
it
was
corroborated
by
them
and
he
purchased
unusual
amounts.
the
sales
girl
said
he
did
not
purchase
that
this
is
--
whether
it
was
--
irregular
amounts
or
excessive
amount.
and
they
said
no,
he
purchased
what
was
normal
and
he
purchased
large
amounts
but
never
in
excess
of
his
rights.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
she
testified
to
that.
she
didn't
say
she
did
that
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
oh,
yes
your
honor
they
are.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
no,
your
honor
this
--
she
said
that
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
she
did
--
she
said
she
did
this
for
some
people,
but
again
this
is
another.
this
is
really
the
key
to
this
whole
case.
this
is
the
reason
the
air
force
convicted
him.
this
is
the
reason,
they
seized
this
ration
card
illegally
from
him,
which
obviously
has
marks
over,
where
he
purchased
more
than
the
normal
amount.
this
was
seized
illegally
and
it
was
not
used
at
the
court-martial.
but
the
government
had
used
it
every
sense,
including
the
reply
to
this
brief.
now
i
asked
my
client
about
this,
and
he
said
that
this
--
these
things
were
old
on
his
card,
what
they
did,
they
called
him
in
and
ordered
him
to
produce
it.
he
said
they
were
old
and
i
wondered
about
that
when
i
went
to
prison
i
took
my
other
card
that
i
had
up
there
and
i
gave
it
--
i
had
it
stamped,
cut
and
when
i
happened
to
ask
curt
and
sure
enough
he
sent
me
his
card
which
is
in
evidence.
where
it
shows
where
they
cut
his
and
it
didn't
cut
it
out
all
together.
in
other
words
it
was
necessary
to
do
it
twice,
is
that
true,
i
don't
know.
but
the
thing
is
that
was
seized
illegally,
it
was
not
part
of
that
trial,
there
was
no
way
for
him
to
defend
it,
but
that
is
the
very
reason,
that
is
the
very
reason
that
this
man
has
been
convicted
and
put
where
he
is
now
and
they
had
refused
to
do
anything
about
it.
and
it
was
illegally
seized
and
it's
something
that
should
never
have
been
brought
up
and
if
it
should
have
been,
it
should
have
been
taken
properly
and
he
should
have
a
right
to
explain
it,
which
he
did
have
an
explanation.
and
there
was
no
question
about
it
being
seized
illegally,
the
government
admits
that
and
it
was
not
used
at
the
court-martial.
but
even
then
there
is
no
where
comparable
that
the
--
what
they
charged
him
with
and
what
they
tried
him
with
he
was
not
guilty
of,
it
was
clear
fabrication.
the
government
argues
on
habeas
corpus
that
is
more
limit
than
what
this
court
has
defined
habeas
corpus
to
be.
this
man
is
still
in
the
service.every
time
his
file
jacket
is
open
this
conviction
is
part
of
that.
every
time
he
comes
up
for
promotion
and
every
time
he
is
considered
for
any
job,
this
is
all
part
of
it.
and
under
the
recent
case
of
carafas
v.
lavallee,
the
court
defined
habeas
corpus.
the
government's
initial
brief
was
that
well
he
wasn't
in
confinement,
but
this
man
was
in
confinement,
he
was
out
and
it's
a
restraint
that
still
follow.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
well,
your
honor
the
same
rules
would
apply.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
we
are
not
seeking
the
relief,
but
i
believe
the
same
principle
applies.
he
is
seeking
something
that
is
due
him
and
the
same
theory
of
habeas
corpus
should
apply.
now
this
is
a
man
who
was
confined,
these
are
restraints
that
still
follow
him.
this
perfectly
qualified
as
a
habeas
corpus
action,
that
he
still
has
a
restraint
on
him
because
of
this
conviction.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
he
has
the
right
to
his
back
pay,
under
the
court
of
claims
jurisdiction.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
under
the
constitution.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
no,
your
honor
they
cannot.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
but
as
a
practical
man
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
no,
your
honor
he
has
been
constitutionally
deprived
of
his
property
and
even
if
it's
a
smaller
amount
he's
still
being
deprived
of
it,
and
the
court
of
claims
has
jurisdiction
to
rule
upon
that,
on
his
constitutional
deprivation
of
salary.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
well,
your
honor
i
do
not
believe
it's
the
equivalent
of
that
in
the
first
place.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
but
when
this
happens
and
i
know
of
no
case
otherwise,
the
correction
board,
when
this
decision
becomes
final
in
effect
corrects
the
record
on
application
based
upon
that
decision
and
i
haven't
heard
of
any
decision
where
it
was
otherwise.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
i'll
do
that
as
soon
as
this
decision
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
they
denied
it
and
this
is
another
basis
for
jurisdiction.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
no
your
honor.
well
i
am
yes,
i
am
questioning
that
opinion.
in
my
brief,
i
say
this
is
another
basis
for
jurisdiction.
in
the
first
place,
one
under
the
correction
statute
the
secretary
can
attack
a
court-martial.
in
other
words
section
76
of
the
finality
clause
says
that
these
--
this
decision
on
a
court-martial
will
be
final
on
all
officers.
but
then
they
come
along
with
the
correction
statute
where
the
secretary
wants
to
correct
them
to
save
congress
from
making
private
bills.
so
the
mr.
francis
j.
steiner
general
rules
and
the
government
agree
the
secretary
can
than
collaterally
attack
the
court-martial.
the
secretary
can
do
that.
now
the
decision
of
the
secretary
is
just
final
on
officers,
it's
not
final
on
courts.
all
the
decisions
of
the
secretary
under
the
correction
board
can
be
reviewed
by
the
court
of
claims.
there
is
no
basis
in
the
legislative
history
or
any
other
thing
to
show
that
they
could
not
review
a
court-martial.
nowhere
does
it
say
that
and
the
government
admits
that
the
secretary
can
collaterally
attack
it,
that's
an
exception
to
section
76.
and
the
statute
under
which
he
does
it
is
only
final
on
officers,
it's
not
final
on
courts.
so
under
the
correction
statute
he
has
a
right
to
be
reviewed
in
the
court
of
claims
under
this,
nowhere
does
it
say
otherwise.
but
even
the
section
76
found,
and
i
believe
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
estep
versus
u.s.
and
the
harmon
v.
brucker
case,
we
had
other
statutes
which
had
finality
provisions
in
them,
there
was
a
finality
provision
in
the
law.
and
the
court
looked
at
this
in
effect
as
a
final
legal
order.
they
can
make
a
final
legal
order,
they
don't
consider
all
orders
final,
just
only
the
final
legal
order.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
no
your
honor.
this
is
another
thing.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
he
had
no
appeal,
he
could
not
take
it
up,
he
could
not
even
ask
him
to
review
it.
there
was
no
appeal
whatsoever.
the
one
man
that
reviewed
it
was
in
the
convening
authority
who
was
a
staff
judge
advocate,
who
was
a
military
lawyer.
he
is
also
the
same
man
who
reviewed
the
specifications
and
advised
suit
to
be
filed
and
advised
on
the
wording
of
them.
in
other
words,
the
only
review
was
by
the
prosecutor
in
effect,
this
--
just
this
court-martial
itself
there
was
nowhere
he
could
go.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
that's
right
your
honor,
not
even
to
consider
whether
they
would
review
it.
there
was
nothing
he
could
do.
no
where
to
go,
this
was
the
only
court
that
could
possibly
consider
his
constitutional
claims.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
if
it's
a
constitutional
depravation,
i
believe
under
like
thompson
versus
city
of
louisville
where
we
had
a
$20
fine.
this
was
constitutional;
this
was
taken
away
from
him
constitutionally.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
here
there
was
no
way,
no
review
he
had
at
all.
this
is
not
a
question
on
corroboration
for
example
of
any
controverted
facts,
the
record
has
to
be
read.
but
the
record
as
read
shows
this
constitutional
depravation
that
it
was
not
corroborated.
it
also
was
not
waived
as,
if
it's
jurisdictional,
which
i
believe
that
it
is
under
this
153a.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
the
board
for
the
correction
of
military
record
is
the
only
thing
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
1552a
28
u.s.c.
--
10
u.s.c
excuse
me.
1552
a.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
your
honor,
there
the
secretary
has
given
the
authority
to
review,
to
correct
any
record
point
in
justice.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
he
can
do,
he
can
take
a
hearing,
he
gathered
all
the
records
and
he
will
accept
any
evidence
you
have,
affidavits
or
he
can
also
hold
a
hearing,
many
times
it's
just
decided
just
upon
the
record.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
of
the
exact
procedure
--
they
do
have
someone
over
here
who
does
this
work,
who
reviews
it,
and
says
this
is
what
can
be
done.
the
statute
reads
the
secretary
of
a
military
department
under
procedures
established
by
him
and
approved
by
the
secretary
of
defense
and
acting
through
boards
of
civilians
of
the
executive.
part
of
that
--
acting
through
boards
of
civilians.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
through
the
executive
part
of
that
military
department
may
correct
any
military
record
of
that
department
when
he
considers
it
necessary
to
correct
an
error
or
remove
an
injustice,
and
that
is
then
reviewable
in
the
court
of
claims,
they
considered
in
this
correction
statute
should
we
make
it
final
on
the
courts,
in
the
legislative
history
and
they
didn't,
they
struck
that
out
–
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
they
did
consider
it
and
deny
it.
i
believe
there's
no
limits
whatsoever
i
think
custer's
lieutenant
was
correct.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
no
your
honor,
i
could
review
the
board
of
correction
of
military
records
in
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
because
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
now,
the
government
admits
that
you
can
do
this.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
no
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
the
measurement
is
whether
it's
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
so,
and
i
believe
it's
a
constitutional
deprivation.
here
this
man
could
have
been
sentenced
to
16
years
in
prison
but
this
record
was
so
unreliable
that
even
they
couldn't
believe
it.
what
they
must
have
reacted
on
was
he
was
charged,
so
he
must
be
guilty
so
we're
giving
six
months
and
then
there
is
no
review.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
i
have
two
distinctions,
that's
one
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
i
don't
know
about
augenblick.
there's
something
i
know
that
they
did
not
make
it
an
issue
in
the
court
of
claims
on
whether
that
was
exceeded,
whether
they
had
appealed
under
the
board
of
correction
but
i
hate
to
say
on
augenblick,
on
this
thing.
but
there
are
other
differences,
one
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
this
legislative
history
as
in
ashe
v.
mcnamara
that
they
discuss
it
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
well,
your
honor
the
court
of
claims
has
jurisdiction
under
any
statute
treaty
or
constitution
and
this
would
be
under
a
statute.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
well,
the
pay
statute
and
also
the
correction
board
statute
because
the
secretary
under
the
statute
is
given
authority
to
correct
an
error
or
remove
an
injustice.
if
that
decision
is
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
he
can
then
take
it
to
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
well,
the
correction
statute
and
the
legislative
history
your
honor
and
the
wordings
of
the
two
statutes
section
76.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
know
what
they
say
a
court-martial
specially
be
reviewed,
but
they
have
reviewed,
the
attorney
general
says
the
secretary
can
review
this.
there
is
no
basis
in
the
history
for
distinguishing
between
the
decisions
of
the
secretary.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
yes
your
honor,
they
considered
shall
we
make
this
finding
final
on
the
courts
and
they
struck
it
out,
that's
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
well,
i've
citied
in
ashe
v.
mcnamara
which
has
a
full
discussion
of
it,
which
i've
referred
from
ashe
v.
mcnamara
to
the
legislative
history,
but
in
addition
one
what
the
difference
is
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
in
your
honor
where
--
it's
in
my
brief
that
a
filed
here,
where
i've
citied
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes
that
--
your
honor
on
page
14
of
my
brief,
on
the
second
paragraph
the
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
i've
filed
a
brief,
reply
brief
of
the
respondent
kenneth
n.
juhl.
but
the
two
circuits,
the
two
circuits,
the
first
and
tenth
circuit
have
construed
this
correction
statute
to
give
them
authority
to
review
court-martials
and
ashe
v.
mcnamara
is
one
and
smith
v.
mcnamara
is
the
other.
so
this
and
there
is
no
decision
saying
that
the
courts
cannot
look
into
court-martials
under
the
correction
board
statute.
the
only
case
closest
is
davies
v.
clifford,
which
the
government
citied,
in
which
they
said
that
he
was
--
he
received
full
relief
from
the
secretary
so
we
had
no
claim
under
that.
so
my
main
difference
is
though
that
i
made
with
augenblick
was
the
correction
board
statute,
the
fact
that
there
was
no
review
whatsoever
for
this
man,
not
even
discretionary
and
the
fact
that
this
is
jurisdictional,
this
was
basic
jurisdiction
under
153a.
the
court-martial
cannot
base
the
conviction
upon
the
uncorroborated
testimony
of
an
accomplice,
where
it's
uncertain,
doubtful
or
improbable.
that
was
jurisdiction
that
told
them
what
they
could
do.
those
three
factors
are
the
reasons
that
turn
in.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
i
think
with
any
corroboration
your
honor
that
its
corroboration
but
you
can't
read
just,
for
example
the
testimonies
of
the
people
who
said,
yes
he
was
out
here,
but
he
didn't
engage
in
any
of
this
activity.
in
fact
he
went
around
and
sat
in
the
front
yard
with
my
wife
and
i
was
so
surprised
to
see
him
come
out.
in
other
words,
he
contradicted
hughes
on
everything
that
hughes
said
to
implicate
it,
contradicted
him
on
every
single
factor.
now
that
can't
be
corroboration
just
because
he
was
out
there
and
he
went
around
to
sit
there
in
the
front
yard,
where
his
wife
also
in
a
later
affidavit
says
he
was
in
the
front
yard
the
whole
time.
and
hughes's
testimony
on
that
there
he
said,
once
he
rode
out
there
with
me
and
he
stood
beside
the
car
and
acted
as
a
lookout.
later
at
the
trial,
he
says
he
went
out
into
the
road
down
the
driveway
to
act
as
a
lookout.
he
testified
at
the
article
32,
all
these
cigars
boxes
we
are
sitting
right
on
the
front
seat
where
he
could
see
it.
the
other
man
comes
up
and
says
they
were
in
the
truck
and
there
weren't
anyway
he
could
have
seen.
this
was
the
corroborating
witnesses.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
the
other,
the
other
possible
collaborator,
in
other
words
he
contradicting
on
everything
and
–-
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
no,
your
honor
but
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
but
that
has
to
be
corroborate
--
in
other
words
he
didn't
corroborate
on
any
of
the
criminal
factors
and
hughes
didn't
repeat
that
testimony
at
the
trial.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
this
was
the
article
33.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
hughes,
hughes,
the
name
the
name
of
accomplish,
the
man
we
complain
off.
he
said
they
were
–
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
he
said
they
were
sitting
in
the
front
seat.
now
he
said
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
that's
his
testimony,
his
testimony
has
to
be
corroborating.
he
is
hughes,
he
has
testified
it,
his
testimony
but
he
didn't
repeat
that
at
the
trial
because
(inaudible)
said,
no
it
was
in
the
trunk,
there
weren't
anyway
you
could
have
seen,
but
these
are
just
replete
with
this
through
out
this
record.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes
your
honor
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
10usca
1552(a)
i've
cited
it
on
page
2
of
my
brief.
10usc
1552(a).
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
well
your
honor
they
say
that
this,
well
this
is
okay
for
the
secretary
to
do
it,
but
it
doesn't,
they
didn't
mean
to
vary
but
there
is
no
provision,
that
they
didn't
mean
that
a
court
could
then
review
it.
but
there
is
no
basis
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
no,
this
is
one
of
my
basic
arguments
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes
your
honor
it
is,
i've
cited.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes
your
honor
it's
quoted.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
on
page
2.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
no
your
honor.
but
in
the
legislative
history
they
said
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
will
be
filed
just
on
officers
and
that
they
consider
will
it
be
on
court
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
it
says
officers
and
they
deleted
courts.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
pardon
me
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
you
are
right
on
that,
that
they
have
never
reviewed
a
court-martial
but
two
circuits
have,
two
circuits
have
and
--
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
well
your
honor
i
think
if
they
were
faced
with
a
case
directly
in
point,
well
that
was
the
only
basis
they
would
construe
it
that
way,
now
that's
just
conjecture
but
they
haven't
ruled
that
i
know,
that
no
this
prohibits
us
from
reviewing
it.
and
the
thing
is,
it
excluded
any
court,
this
is
general
court,
they
didn't
specify
courts
could
and
which
couldn't.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
this
is
the
very
basis
of
the
ashe.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
the
first
and
tenth
circuit
your
honor
ashe
versus
mcnamara.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
which
is
3355
federal
second

yes
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
is
smith
versus
mcnamara
395
f
second
896.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
no,
your
honor
these
were
under
the
correction
board
statue
ashe
for
example
was
not
in
fact
--
and
they
didn't
hold
in
its
favor
and
smith,
but
they
ruled
they
had
jurisdiction
in
accordance
of
ashe.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
the
secretary
could
do
anything
your
honor
i
believe.
mr.
francis
j.
steiner,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
thank
you.
