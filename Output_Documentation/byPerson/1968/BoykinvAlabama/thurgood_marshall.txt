justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
mr.
clark
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
show
that
any
one
of
those
jurors
have
asked
any
question
at
all
about
anything
at
any
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
are
even
not
very
qualified,
don't
we?
we
don't
even
know
where
the
other
21
though?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
don't
even
know
what
they
can
hear?
nobody
questioned
him
at
all,
are
you
--
what
is
the
practice,
you
just
pick
12
people
and
put
them
in
a
jury
box?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
where
is
the
qualification
in
this
record.
justice
thurgood
marshall
now
the
record
says
it
--
well,
the
judge
says,
if
i'm
correct,
there
are
12
people
there.
that's
what
he
says
on
page
10,
if
i'm
correct
that
there
are
12
on
the
panel
of
jurors
seated
in
the
jury
box.
and
he
says,
is
that
satisfy
--
satisfactory?
both
sides
said,
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
him.
and
then
isn't
it
also
true
that
at
the
end
the
judge
said,
are
you
the
same
jury,
was
here
yesterday?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
said
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
sir?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
same
12?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
said,
young
man
i
had
to
call
you
back
as
applied
and
misses
something
that
acknowledge
not
where
they
just
--
near
the
end
there,
well,
he
says,
you
were
here.
i'll
get
the
page
in
just
a
moment.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
on
page
32,
some
of
you
gentlemen
were
on
the

the
meaning
of
that,
it
varies
from
day
to
day?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
it
vary
or
--
i
thought

justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
just
one
more
question.
is
--
is
there
anything
in
this
record
that
shows
that
the
court
explained
to
the
jury
the
range
of
sentence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
the
jury
did
not
have
any
idea
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
page
is
that
on?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
--
what
is
there
that
you
just
read
that
shows
why
you
should
give
death
in
one
case
and
ten
years
in
another,
that's
my
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
other
than
that?
