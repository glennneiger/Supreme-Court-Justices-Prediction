justice
potter
stewart
did
you
--
did
i
understand
that
there
was
no
motion
at
anytime
to
withdraw
the
plea
of
guilty?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
interested
in
the
statement
of
facts
on
page
7
of
your
brief.
it
indicates
that
after
this
conviction
and
death
sentence
there
was
an
automatic
appeal
under
alabama
law
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
the
alabama
court
despite
the
conceded
indigency
of
the
petitioner
did
not
appoint
counsel
on
appeal
and
thereafter
when
member
of
this
similarly
union
attempted
to
represent
him,
he
was
told
that
he
could
not
because
he
wasn't
authorized
to
practice?
justice
potter
stewart
and
thereafter
when
i
guess
you
entered
the
case.
it
was
too
late
as
you
say
to
raise
any
issue
on
motion
for
a
new
trial
as
the
statutory
time
period
had
elapsed.
i'm
interested
in
knowing
just
what
that
means.
justice
potter
stewart
apparently
the
trial
court
neglect
it,
it
actually
imposed
a
sentence,
didn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
they're
to
set
the
date?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
must
be
made
within
30
days
of
the
sentence?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
uhmm-mm.
justice
potter
stewart
and
by
the
time
he
had
a
lawyer,
the
30-day
period
had
elapsed.
justice
potter
stewart
and
can
you
tell
us
in
a
word
what
might
have
been
done
if
the
30-day
period
had
not
elapsed?
justice
potter
stewart
about
what,
which
one?
justice
potter
stewart
and
still,
if
we
can
just
for
a
moment
confine
ourselves,
if
you're
willing
to,
to
the
question
i
asked,
what
could've
been
done
within
than
30-day
period?
that
could
not
have
been
done
after
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
because
he
did
have
trial
counsel,
did
he?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
yes,
it
was
appointed
by
the
court,
that
he
had
trial
counsel.
justice
potter
stewart
it
doesn't
embrace
any
duties
to
make
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yeah
--
but.
justice
potter
stewart
--
practice
down
there.
well
now,
i
suppose
after
the
sentence,
it
would've
been
too
late
then
to
withdraw
the
plea
of
guilty
or
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
that
has
to
--
a
motion
to
withdraw
of
plea
of
guilty
has
to
be
made
before
sentence
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
gibbons,
the
printed
appendix
doesn't
contain
any
transcript
at
all
of
how
this
jury
was
qualified
the
voir
dire
of
the
jury,
is
that
available
anywhere?
is
there
a
typewritten
transcript
to
that
in
the
original
record?
justice
potter
stewart
can
you
--
i
have
in
mind
this
--
perhaps
you
might
guess
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
witherspoon
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
witherspoon
against
illinois,
you
make
no
contention
under
that
decision
but
it
occurred
to
me
that
there
might
well
be
one
to
make.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what's
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
--
do
the
statutes
or
laws
or
case
law
of
alabama
with
respect
to
qualifying
a
jury
in
a
capital
case
throw
any
light
on
this
question?
justice
potter
stewart
what
did
they
--?
justice
potter
stewart
scoops
--
what's
--
what's
the
purport
of
them?
justice
potter
stewart
it
occurs
to
me
that
you
representing
a
client
under
sentence
of
death
have
put
a
good
many
eggs
in
one
basket
and
if
you
have
a
witherspoon
claim,
who
do
you
make
it
or
perhaps
federal
habeas
corpus
is
a
more
appropriate
place
for
that
and
perhaps
you've
considered
that.
justice
potter
stewart
as
far
as
it
appears
from
what
i've
been
able
to
a
glean,
of
course
we
don't
have
the
briefs
of
the
parties
before
the
supreme
court
before
us
but
really
nothing
at
all
was
raised
at
the
trial.
there
was
simply
a
guilty
plea
and
then
as
counsel
has
said,
five
sentences
of
death
on
one
--
on
this
petitioner
and
that's
all
that
appears
plus
some
evidence
of
his
--
of
the
conduct.
and
then
in
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
all
that
appears
that
they
considered
of
the
questions
raised
here
was
whether
or
not
the
trial
court
failed
to
protect
the
petitioner's
right
to
due
process
for
--
with
regard
to
his
plea
of
guilty
as
you
put
it.
and
that's
the
only
thing
they
considered.
justice
potter
stewart
and
neither
one
of
the
other
two
questions
so
far
as
i
can
find
out
was
raised
or
considered
or
decided
in
any
of
the
courts
of
alabama.
is
--
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
it
wasn't
raised
at
the
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
either
one
of
these
two
odd
questions.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
it
also
involved
a
very
horrible
killing
too,
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
did
in
your
brief
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
certainly,
you
can
explain
it
freely.
justice
potter
stewart
but
all
of
the
--
i
gather
that
the
--
all
of
the
circumstances
of
the
robbery
including
this
very
gruesome
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
it
was
a
bizarre
sort
of
killing
where
it
was
brought
before
the
jury,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
what
he
took
was
the
young
woman's
car
after
killing.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
this
trial
took
place
september
of
1966.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
when
the
jury
was
in
--
the
panel
sworn
as
indicated
on
page
10
of
the
appendix.
justice
potter
stewart
long
before
this
court's
decision
in
the
witherspoon
case,
so
that
the
defense
counsel
was
not
aware
of
any
right
to
challenge
the
jury
on
the
basis
--
the
constitutional
basis
on
which
witherspoon
was
decided,
was
corrected?
justice
potter
stewart
how
can
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
wasn't
a
known
waiver
though
was
it?
it
couldn't
have
been
any
known
waiver
of
any
right
under
the
witherspoon
case
because
the
witherspoon
case
hadn't
been
decided.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
here
there
was
a
plea
of
guilt
though
so
that
would
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
hardly
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
judge
--
i'm
looking
at
page
33
of
the
printed
appendix,
in
sentencing
the
petitioner
indicated
at
least
by
negative
implication
of
you
will
that
he
had
some
discretion
not
to
follow
the
jury's
recommendation
of
a
death
sentence.
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
he
says
in
case
number
15520,
the
court
will
impose
a
sentence
according
to
the
verdict
of
the
jury.
and
in
case
number
15521,
the
court
again
will
follow
the
verdict
of
the
jury.
so
on
and
so
--
which
leads
to
a
possible
implication
that
he
didn't
have
a
duty
to
do
so.
am
i
--
what
is
the
law
of
alabama
on
that?
justice
potter
stewart
send
it
back
to
whom?
justice
potter
stewart
for
what?
justice
potter
stewart
i
wonder
what
kind
of
instructions.
justice
potter
stewart
if
they
could
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
they
did
have
that
option.
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
saying
it
is
a
matter
of
law,
the
court
is
not
allowed
to
accept
a
plea
of
guilty
to
first
degree
murder
of
alabama
or
are
you
just
telling
that
that's
the
practice?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
for
example
in
the
state
that
--
with
which
i'm
most
familiar
as
a
matter
of
law,
a
trial
court
is
limited
in
accepting,
that
being
allowed
to
accept
a
plea
of
guilty
to
first
degree.
is
there
any
such
law
in
your
state?
justice
potter
stewart
you
just
mean
as
a
matter
of
practice
they
cup
a
plea
to
second
degree
murder?
justice
potter
stewart
after
a
plea
of
guilty?
justice
potter
stewart
did
you
--
did
i
understand
that
there
was
no
motion
at
anytime
to
withdraw
the
