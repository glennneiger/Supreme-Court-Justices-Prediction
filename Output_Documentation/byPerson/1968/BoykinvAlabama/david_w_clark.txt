mr.
david
w.
clark
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
april
and
may
of
1966,
mobile,
alabama
experienced
a
series
of
robbery.
one
edward
boykin
was
arrested.
the
grand
jury
returned
five
indictments
against
him
for
robbery.
i
would
like
to
point
out
the
time
element
and
the
space
of
the
city
involved.
these
five
robberies
took
place
from
april
the
23rd
1966.
that
was
the
first
one.
there
was
one
on
may
the
3rd,
one
on
may
the
5th,
one
on
may
the
8th,
one
on
may
the
8th.
the
manner
of
operation
was
that
this
young
man
went
into
either
grocery
store
or
drugstore
service
station
and
would
exhibit
a
pistol
and
commit
robbery
and
then
when
he
would
leave,
he
fired
the
pistol
so
nobody
would
follow
him
out.
there
was
one
wounding
of
a
little
girl.
i
believe,
the
evidence
shows
that
he
fired
into
the
floor,
the
bullet
ricocheted
and
hit
this
young
lady
in
the
leg.
now,
at
the
time
of
the
trial
the
court
appointed,
one
evan
austill,
is
the
court
appointed
attorney
to
represent
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
evan
austill,
a-u-s-t-i
double
l
judge.
his
father
and
he
had
practiced
together.
the
father
has
been
a
member
of
the
bar
for
many
years.
after
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
i
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
i'm
not
the
going
to
but
i
would
stand
on
my
brief,
i
think
it
explains
some
of
it
your
honor.
mr.
david
w.
clark
which
particular
question
was
that
your
honor?
mr.
david
w.
clark
well,
i
feel
that
under
this
section,
title
15,
section
382,
1-13
wherein
the
supreme
court
considered
all
the
things
raised
at
the
trial
that
you
could
do
that
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that's
right.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
you
are
correct
that
it
could
have
been
considered
although
they
did
not
mentioned
under
that
title
15,
section
382
wherein
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
not
raised
at
the
trial.
a
while
ago
you
raised
the
question
about
the
witherspoon
matter
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
whether
witherspoon
applies
to
this.
i
would
like
to
call
your
honor's
attention
to
appendix
page
10
and
11
wherein
mr.
signey
flagger
of
the
assistant
district
attorney
prosecuting
the
case
pointed
out
they
had
12
jurors
sitting
in
a
box,
would
they
be
alright
in
the
defendant
there
said
they
would
and
his
attorney,
mr.
austill
said
the
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
this
is
the
entire
matter
and
i
have
the
original
record
here
and
nothing
was
said
by
qualifying
them
as
to
death
penalty.
mr.
david
w.
clark
it
was
an
agreed
jury.
both
sides
agreed
that
they
would
be
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
they
want
a
jury.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
you
pick
12
and
then
you
qualify
them
and
then
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
by
agreement,
both
sides
agreed
that
they
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
that
mr.
flagger
was
one
of
the
sides
and
that
he
is
a
district
attorney
there
prosecuting
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
--
jurors
are
selected
for
a
week,
the
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
the
juries
in
alabama
are
selected
for
that
week
of
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
they
argue
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
from
the
jury
roll.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that
--
that
is
correct.
there
was
--
already
been
selected.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that
is
correct.
did
this
--
the
jury
had
been
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
this
one
had
been
qualified
as
to
that.
mr.
david
w.
clark
punishment?
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
i
said
that
the
panel
that
--
they
call
at
least
50
jurors.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
they
all
charged
there
was
not.
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
may
i
quote
from
the
actual
record,
record
page
30.
he
said,
if
that
board,
he
gave
a
definition
of
robbery.
now,
robbery
once
again
gentlemen
is
a
felonious
taking
of
money
or
goods
of
value
from
another
against
his
will
and
without
his
permission
by
violence
of
putting
him
in
fear.
that
boils
it
down
in
a
nutshell
just
what
robbery
is.
now,
it
carries
from
10
years
minimum
in
the
penitentiary
to
the
supreme
penalty
of
death
by
electrocution.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that
is
on
--
that's
the
old
rule
charge
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
the
page
is
--
is
it
on
page
32
--
page
32
in
the
appendix.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
there
was
no
direction
as
to
how
you
would
do
that.
however,
this
court
pointed
out
in
i
believe
it
was
giaccio
versus
pennsylvania,
i
think
it
was
one
of
them,
that
they
could
do
that.
a
jury
could
find
the
degree.
there
was
nothing
prohibiting
that.
now,
i
would
point
out
that
in
alabama,
robbery
is
a
capital
offense.
that
of
course
means
it
carries
a
death
penalty
and
the
--
they
can,
to
a
lesser
degree
give
anywhere
from
death
on
down
to
10
years.
and
that's
left
to
the
jurors
discretion
now
in
spite
of
no
instructions,
you
do
have
this,
that
this
jury
has
heard
the
entire
trial.
they
have
been
able
to
determine
how
severe
or
a
case
of
robbery
this
is
in
this
particular
instance
that
there
was
a
gun
used,
there
was
violence
and
they
confessed
on
that.
they
are
the
best
ones
to
judge
how
severe
the
sentence
should
be.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
--
that
is
the
entire
evidence
they
put
on.
in
alabama
when
you
have
a
plea
of
guilty
such
as
we
had
here,
they
put
on
a
prima
facie
case.
now
in
all
five
of
these
cases,
i
think
they
called
seven
witnesses.
that's
also
required.
you
have
the
man
pleading
guilty
which
is
judicial
confession
to
that
effect.
he
had
a
plea
of
guilty.
you
have
that
plus
the
prima
facie
case
made
out
by
the
state.
we
maintain
that
sufficient
to
put
it
to
the
jury.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
there
has
not
been
one
yet
because
of
this
petitioner
for
this
honorable
court.
had
there
not
been
one
to
this
court,
then
about
two
or
three
days
before
his
execution
there
would
--
been
a
hearing
in
the
governor's
office,
a
clemency
hearing.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
that
is
automatic.
at
this
hearing
he
may
appear
by
himself,
by
attorney,
his
family,
his
minister.
i
have
been
at
some
of
them
that
they've
had
as
many
as
35
or
40
people
to
speak
for
this
man
and
ask
that
his
case
be
commuted
to
life
imprisonment.
but
as
you
pointed
out
that
there
has
been
on
a
district
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that's
has
been
several
years.
mr.
david
w.
clark
in
my
brief
i've
pointed
out
one
that
was
in
1964
that
i
handled
that
case
through
the
alabama
supreme
court
and
it
went
on
to
electrocution.
that
incidentally
was
one
for
robbery.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
but
may
i
explain
that,
your
honor.
in
alabama
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
well,
i
--
i
would
have
politely.
but
in
that
particular
case,
there
was
a
robbery
and
also
that
the
man
committed
a
murder
while
--
during
this
robbery.
it
just
happen
that
he
was
going
with
this
young
lady,
he
was
a
married
man
with
a
family
and
as
the
district
attorney
determined
in
that
case
that
there
were
--
had
two
indictment,
one
for
murder
and
one
for
robbery
that
it
would
be
better
to
prosecute
under
robbery.
in
alabama
they
regard
robbery
as
a
serious
offense.
now
a
good
attorney
could
have
possibly
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
--
attacked
the
young
lady's
reputation
and
maybe
they'd
been
merely
held
manslaughter
conviction.
mr.
david
w.
clark
all
they
did
was
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
car,
jewelry
and
some
money.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
that
applies
merely
to
the
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
--
death
sentence.
yes,
sir.
he
could've
asked
for
an
appeal
and
in
granting
one,
also
an
attorney,
a
transcript
of
the
record.
now
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
the
appellate
courts
had
that
duty
in
our
case
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
that's
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
--
look
into
the
record.
mr.
david
w.
clark
now
the
--
pardon.
there
was
something
brought
out
about
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
usually
that's
done
by
the
attorney
who
is
appointed
to
handle
the
defense
of
that
trial.
also
in
a
case
which
results
in
the
death
penalty,
the
same
attorney
goes
right
onto
the
supreme
court.
in
one
form,
it
takes
back,
however,
mr.
gibbons
is
representing
the
defendant
on
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
and
on
a
certiorari
to
this
court.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
not
in
this
type
of
case
because
jury
returns
a
verdict.
however,
the
defendant
could
put
on
character
witnesses,
things
of
that
nature
during
the
trial.
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
he
could
do
that.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that
is
true.
that
would
be
a
matter
of
trial
strategy
and
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
--
and
i
don't
think
the
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
feel
that
that
this
case
here
represents
one
of
those.
this
attorney
entered
a
plea
of
guilty
for
the
man
and
i
suppose
assuming
that
there
would
a
prison
sentence.
what
brought
this
on
as
i
pointed
out
earlier
is
there
had
been
a
series
of
robberies
and
the
jury
returned
this
verdict.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
correct.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that
is
true.
however,
he
did
have
those
challenges
that
were
set
out
in
title
30,
section
55
and
57
and
in
the
argument
last
week,
i
pointed
out
that
if
he
had
fixed
opinion
against
capital
punishment,
could
be
the
one
on
the
section
57.
however
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
we
contend
that
they
waived
that.
mr.
david
w.
clark
it
was
by
agree
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
and
that
is
another
thing
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
this
court.
this
man
still
has
his
opportunity
to
go
back
before
the
state
court
on
coram
nobis
and
bring
these
things
up.
at
that
time
he
would
be
appointed
an
attorney.
they
would
have
a
full
hearing
on
these
matters,
the
identical
matters
brought
up
now.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
that
--
that's
still
the
law.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
that
would
be
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
they
should.
the
record
does
not
reflect
that
here.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
don't
know
that
it
wasn't
done
your
honor.
it's
just
not
recorded
as
such.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
i
was
not
present
at
the
trial.
however,
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
your
honor,
you
have
rule
11,
your
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
that
require
such
warning
to
the
defendant
and
while
no
particular
writs
shouldn't
be
observed
by
the
trial
court
such
as
a
form
finding
a
recitation
of
plea
was
entered
with
understanding
and
affirmed
the
duty,
nonetheless
exists
on
the
part
of
the
trial
court
to
advise
the
accused
fully.
and
that's
recited
from
hulsey
versus
united
states,
that's
369
f.2d
284.
so
apparently
in
your
federal
court
volume,
on
your
federal
rules
you
have
the
duty.
you
don't
have
to
find,
it
simply
show
that
in
the
record.
and
there
is
no
showing
that
this
man
was
not
advised
to
the
serious
and
sentence
relief.
besides
that
he
had
an
attorney
to
represent
him.
mr.
david
w.
clark
this
one
--
the
particular
one
was
before
judge
gillard.
mr.
david
w.
clark
judge
gillard
has
been
on
the
bench
i
think
about
6
or
8
years
as
a
circuit
judge.
at
one
time
he
serves
as
a
probe
judge
also.
mr.
david
w.
clark
walter
gillard,
i
believe.
and
i
don't
the
middle
initial.
mr.
david
w.
clark
palmer,
his
brother
i
believe
and
his
father
was
i
believe
palmer
gilliard
also.
he
was
our
senior
member
of
the
bar.
he
died
at
the
age
of
103.
now
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
--
they
as
a
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
notwithstanding
the
verdict,
i
believe
is
that
the
judge
could
send
it
back?
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
the
jury
didn't
agree
did
a
predetermined
sentence.
mr.
david
w.
clark
he
could
instruct
the
jury
just
on
that
matter.
he
thought
it
was
--
did
not
warrant
that
penalty.
however
in
alabama
your
death
penalty
is
provided
of
robbery
and
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
he'd
already
instructed
them
that
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
they
have
thought
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
don't
have
it
before
me
your
honor
but
there
have
been
cases
where
they
have
done
that.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
i
don't
have
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
now
there
was
something
brought
out
in
the
brief
about
the
finding
of
guilty
by
the
jury
and
the
fixing
of
the
sentence
by
that
same
jury
violated
his
constitutional
rights.
i
believe
this
honorable
court
in
a
footnote
in
giaccio
versus
pennsylvania
held
that
in
so
holding
we
intend
to
cast
no
doubt
whatever
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
settled
practice
in
many
states
to
lead
the
juries
fixing
defendant's
guilty
crime,
the
power
to
fix
punishment
within
legally
prescribed
limits.
now,
i
found
two
cases
when
courts
had
followed
that
one
is
in
california,
in
re
anderson,
california
supreme
court
on
november
18th
of
1968
filed
it.
that
was
in
a
murder
case
however
--
but
they
had
--
they
under
i
believe
section
160
of
their
criminal
code,
the
jury
could
find
the
person
guilty
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
and
under
the
section
160.1
the
same
jury
could
fix
his
punishment
at
either
death
or
life
imprisonment.
and
supreme
court
of
california
held
that
that
was
no
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights
and
this
same
thing
was
followed
in
the
supreme
court
of
washington,
washington
versus
smith
in
the
washington
supreme
court
on
october
29th,
1968.
and
the
last
paragraph
of
that
opinion
i
think
is
a
burden
here.
the
defendant's
argument
against
the
death
sentence
on
moral
and
practical
grounds
are
persuasive
however
they
should
be
addressed
to
the
legislature.
if
as
they
maintain
a
majority
of
people
today
are
impose
to
the
death
penalty
an
effort
to
get
the
legislature
to
eliminate
it
should
have
a
considerable
chance
of
success.
that's
our
contention
if
there's
objection
to
the
death
penalty.
the
proper
way
is
to
take
that
through
the
legislature
and
this
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
they
were
informed
and
the
jury
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
it
doesn't
appear
from
the
record
here
but
when
there
has
been
a
plea
of
guilty
in
alabama
the
jury
hears
a
prima
facie
case
to
determine
the
seriousness
of
the
crime.
mr.
david
w.
clark
to
determine
the
sentence.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
it
was
meant
--
principally
the
question
of
punishment.
there
had
been
a
plea
of
guilty
already.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
that
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
usually
when
they
enter
a
plea
of
guilty
to
murder
they'll
enter
a
plea
of
murder
to
the
second
degree
which
would
cover
the
life
sentence.
but
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
they
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
--
to
track
them
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
--
first
degree
murder.
mr.
david
w.
clark
they
go
to
trial.
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
know
of
no
case
in
which
that
has
happened
your
honor
that
they
held
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
i
know
of
none
but
i
had
in
practice
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
that's
correct.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that
is
not.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
i
believe
mr.
justice
black,
that's
the
answer
to
my
question.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
you
could
not
have
the
conviction
without
putting
on
a
prima
facie
case.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
it
would
not
be
on
this
robbery.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
think
that's
what
this
is.
mr.
david
w.
clark
he
could
so
instruct
the
jury.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that
no
prima
facie
case
was
made
out.
mr.
david
w.
clark
then
i'll
assume
the
defense
counsel
would
then
move
for
a
directive
verdict.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that
would
taint
the
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
not
to
my
knowledge.
prima
facie
case
wouldn't
take
too
much
to
put
on
your
honor
just
one
or
two
witnesses
at
the
most.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
that
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
that's
what
i
mentioned
a
while
ago,
would
it
satisfy
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes
of
course
they're
substantially
the
same
as
the
original
record.
mr.
david
w.
clark
however
--
oh,
you
--
i
get
what
you
mean
sir.
no,
sir.
you
are
assuming
that
he
did
not
because
it
does
not
appear
in
the
record,
is
that
correct?
mr.
david
w.
clark
and
i
believe
the
case
cite
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
now
the
case
of
o'connor
versus
cochran
that
he
cited
in
support
of
that
had
to
do
with
the
confession
i
believe
but
--
i
did
cite
a
case
wherein
it
--
there
was
no
particular
format
that
they
had
to
use
or
nothing
--
in
the
effect
on
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
but
all
it
appears
there
is
not
shown
in
the
record,
exactly
the
questions
he
asked.
mr.
david
w.
clark
if
he
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
that's
--
that's
all
the
spoken
and
written
words
that
were
transcribed
and
put
in
the
record
either
in
the
record
that
it
was
before
the
alabama
supreme
court
of
this
honorable
court.
however,
as
i've
pointed
and
i
cited
one
case
that
there's
nothing
that
requires
to
my
knowledge
that
it
appear
in
the
record
that
he
did
so
advised
and
in
fact
say,
mr.
boykin,
you
know
that
you
can
get
the
death
penalty.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that's
correct.
your
honor
i
believe
that
that
in
my
brief
explained
my
points
and
i
thank
you
for
your
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
your
honor
i
have
copies
of
mr.
gibbons'
both
of
his
briefs
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
they
had
been
in
my
folder
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
i
have
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
thank
you,
your
honor.
it's
always
a
pleasure
and
privilege
to
be
able
to.
mr.
david
w.
clark
may
i
state
to
the
court
that
i
consider
it
a
greatest
honor
that
i
have
received
during
my
legal
career.
mr.
david
w.
clark
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
april
and
may
of
1966,
mobile,
alabama
experienced
a
series
of
robbery.
one
edward
boykin
was
arrested.
the
grand
jury
returned
five
indictments
against
him
for
robbery.
i
would
like
to
point
out
the
time
element
and
the
space
of
the
city
involved.
these
five
robberies
took
place
from
april
the
23rd
1966.
that
was
the
first
one.
there
was
one
on
may
the
3rd,
one
on
may
the
5th,
one
on
may
the
8th,
one
on
may
the
8th.
the
manner
of
operation
was
that
this
young
man
went
into
either
grocery
store
or
drugstore
service
station
and
would
exhibit
a
pistol
and
commit
robbery
and
then
when
he
would
leave,
he
fired
the
pistol
so
nobody
would
follow
him
out.
there
was
one
wounding
of
a
little
girl.
i
believe,
the
evidence
shows
that
he
fired
into
the
floor,
the
bullet
ricocheted
and
hit
this
young
lady
in
the
leg.
now,
at
the
time
of
the
trial
the
court
appointed,
one
evan
austill,
is
the
court
appointed
attorney
to
represent
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
evan
austill,
a-u-s-t-i
double
l
judge.
his
father
and
he
had
practiced
together.
the
father
has
been
a
member
of
the
bar
for
many
years.
after
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
i
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
i'm
not
the
going
to
but
i
would
stand
on
my
brief,
i
think
it
explains
some
of
it
your
honor.
mr.
david
w.
clark
which
particular
question
was
that
your
honor?
mr.
david
w.
clark
well,
i
feel
that
under
this
section,
title
15,
section
382,
1-13
wherein
the
supreme
court
considered
all
the
things
raised
at
the
trial
that
you
could
do
that
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that's
right.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
you
are
correct
that
it
could
have
been
considered
although
they
did
not
mentioned
under
that
title
15,
section
382
wherein
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
not
raised
at
the
trial.
a
while
ago
you
raised
the
question
about
the
witherspoon
matter
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
whether
witherspoon
applies
to
this.
i
would
like
to
call
your
honor's
attention
to
appendix
page
10
and
11
wherein
mr.
signey
flagger
of
the
assistant
district
attorney
prosecuting
the
case
pointed
out
they
had
12
jurors
sitting
in
a
box,
would
they
be
alright
in
the
defendant
there
said
they
would
and
his
attorney,
mr.
austill
said
the
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
this
is
the
entire
matter
and
i
have
the
original
record
here
and
nothing
was
said
by
qualifying
them
as
to
death
penalty.
mr.
david
w.
clark
it
was
an
agreed
jury.
both
sides
agreed
that
they
would
be
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
they
want
a
jury.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
you
pick
12
and
then
you
qualify
them
and
then
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
by
agreement,
both
sides
agreed
that
they
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
that
mr.
flagger
was
one
of
the
sides
and
that
he
is
a
district
attorney
there
prosecuting
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
--
jurors
are
selected
for
a
week,
the
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
the
juries
in
alabama
are
selected
for
that
week
of
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
they
argue
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
from
the
jury
roll.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that
--
that
is
correct.
there
was
--
already
been
selected.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that
is
correct.
did
this
--
the
jury
had
been
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
this
one
had
been
qualified
as
to
that.
mr.
david
w.
clark
punishment?
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
i
said
that
the
panel
that
--
they
call
at
least
50
jurors.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
they
all
charged
there
was
not.
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
may
i
quote
from
the
actual
record,
record
page
30.
he
said,
if
that
board,
he
gave
a
definition
of
robbery.
now,
robbery
once
again
gentlemen
is
a
felonious
taking
of
money
or
goods
of
value
from
another
against
his
will
and
without
his
permission
by
violence
of
putting
him
in
fear.
that
boils
it
down
in
a
nutshell
just
what
robbery
is.
now,
it
carries
from
10
years
minimum
in
the
penitentiary
to
the
supreme
penalty
of
death
by
electrocution.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that
is
on
--
that's
the
old
rule
charge
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
the
page
is
--
is
it
on
page
32
--
page
32
in
the
appendix.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
there
was
no
direction
as
to
how
you
would
do
that.
however,
this
court
pointed
out
in
i
believe
it
was
giaccio
versus
pennsylvania,
i
think
it
was
one
of
them,
that
they
could
do
that.
a
jury
could
find
the
degree.
there
was
nothing
prohibiting
that.
now,
i
would
point
out
that
in
alabama,
robbery
is
a
capital
offense.
that
of
course
means
it
carries
a
death
penalty
and
the
--
they
can,
to
a
lesser
degree
give
anywhere
from
death
on
down
to
10
years.
and
that's
left
to
the
jurors
discretion
now
in
spite
of
no
instructions,
you
do
have
this,
that
this
jury
has
heard
the
entire
trial.
they
have
been
able
to
determine
how
severe
or
a
case
of
robbery
this
is
in
this
particular
instance
that
there
was
a
gun
used,
there
was
violence
and
they
confessed
on
that.
they
are
the
best
ones
to
judge
how
severe
the
sentence
should
be.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
--
that
is
the
entire
evidence
they
put
on.
in
alabama
when
you
have
a
plea
of
guilty
such
as
we
had
here,
they
put
on
a
prima
facie
case.
now
in
all
five
of
these
cases,
i
think
they
called
seven
witnesses.
that's
also
required.
you
have
the
man
pleading
guilty
which
is
judicial
confession
to
that
effect.
he
had
a
plea
of
guilty.
you
have
that
plus
the
prima
facie
case
made
out
by
the
state.
we
maintain
that
sufficient
to
put
it
to
the
jury.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
there
has
not
been
one
yet
because
of
this
petitioner
for
this
honorable
court.
had
there
not
been
one
to
this
court,
then
about
two
or
three
days
before
his
execution
there
would
--
been
a
hearing
in
the
governor's
office,
a
clemency
hearing.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
that
is
automatic.
at
this
hearing
he
may
appear
by
himself,
by
attorney,
his
family,
his
minister.
i
have
been
at
some
of
them
that
they've
had
as
many
as
35
or
40
people
to
speak
for
this
man
and
ask
that
his
case
be
commuted
to
life
imprisonment.
but
as
you
pointed
out
that
there
has
been
on
a
district
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that's
has
been
several
years.
mr.
david
w.
clark
in
my
brief
i've
pointed
out
one
that
was
in
1964
that
i
handled
that
case
through
the
alabama
supreme
court
and
it
went
on
to
electrocution.
that
incidentally
was
one
for
robbery.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
but
may
i
explain
that,
your
honor.
in
alabama
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
well,
i
--
i
would
have
politely.
but
in
that
particular
case,
there
was
a
robbery
and
also
that
the
man
committed
a
murder
while
--
during
this
robbery.
it
just
happen
that
he
was
going
with
this
young
lady,
he
was
a
married
man
with
a
family
and
as
the
district
attorney
determined
in
that
case
that
there
were
--
had
two
indictment,
one
for
murder
and
one
for
robbery
that
it
would
be
better
to
prosecute
under
robbery.
in
alabama
they
regard
robbery
as
a
serious
offense.
now
a
good
attorney
could
have
possibly
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
--
attacked
the
young
lady's
reputation
and
maybe
they'd
been
merely
held
manslaughter
conviction.
mr.
david
w.
clark
all
they
did
was
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
car,
jewelry
and
some
money.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
that
applies
merely
to
the
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
--
death
sentence.
yes,
sir.
he
could've
asked
for
an
appeal
and
in
granting
one,
also
an
attorney,
a
transcript
of
the
record.
now
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
the
appellate
courts
had
that
duty
in
our
case
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
that's
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
--
look
into
the
record.
mr.
david
w.
clark
now
the
--
pardon.
there
was
something
brought
out
about
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
usually
that's
done
by
the
attorney
who
is
appointed
to
handle
the
defense
of
that
trial.
also
in
a
case
which
results
in
the
death
penalty,
the
same
attorney
goes
right
onto
the
supreme
court.
in
one
form,
it
takes
back,
however,
mr.
gibbons
is
representing
the
defendant
on
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
and
on
a
certiorari
to
this
court.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
not
in
this
type
of
case
because
jury
returns
a
verdict.
however,
the
defendant
could
put
on
character
witnesses,
things
of
that
nature
during
the
trial.
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
he
could
do
that.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that
is
true.
that
would
be
a
matter
of
trial
strategy
and
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
--
and
i
don't
think
the
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
feel
that
that
this
case
here
represents
one
of
those.
this
attorney
entered
a
plea
of
guilty
for
the
man
and
i
suppose
assuming
that
there
would
a
prison
sentence.
what
brought
this
on
as
i
pointed
out
earlier
is
there
had
been
a
series
of
robberies
and
the
jury
returned
this
verdict.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
correct.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that
is
true.
however,
he
did
have
those
challenges
that
were
set
out
in
title
30,
section
55
and
57
and
in
the
argument
last
week,
i
pointed
out
that
if
he
had
fixed
opinion
against
capital
punishment,
could
be
the
one
on
the
section
57.
however
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
we
contend
that
they
waived
that.
mr.
david
w.
clark
it
was
by
agree
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
and
that
is
another
thing
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
this
court.
this
man
still
has
his
opportunity
to
go
back
before
the
state
court
on
coram
nobis
and
bring
these
things
up.
at
that
time
he
would
be
appointed
an
attorney.
they
would
have
a
full
hearing
on
these
matters,
the
identical
matters
brought
up
now.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
that
--
that's
still
the
law.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
that
would
be
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
they
should.
the
record
does
not
reflect
that
here.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
don't
know
that
it
wasn't
done
your
honor.
it's
just
not
recorded
as
such.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
i
was
not
present
at
the
trial.
however,
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
your
honor,
you
have
rule
11,
your
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
that
require
such
warning
to
the
defendant
and
while
no
particular
writs
shouldn't
be
observed
by
the
trial
court
such
as
a
form
finding
a
recitation
of
plea
was
entered
with
understanding
and
affirmed
the
duty,
nonetheless
exists
on
the
part
of
the
trial
court
to
advise
the
accused
fully.
and
that's
recited
from
hulsey
versus
united
states,
that's
369
f.2d
284.
so
apparently
in
your
federal
court
volume,
on
your
federal
rules
you
have
the
duty.
you
don't
have
to
find,
it
simply
show
that
in
the
record.
and
there
is
no
showing
that
this
man
was
not
advised
to
the
serious
and
sentence
relief.
besides
that
he
had
an
attorney
to
represent
him.
mr.
david
w.
clark
this
one
--
the
particular
one
was
before
judge
gillard.
mr.
david
w.
clark
judge
gillard
has
been
on
the
bench
i
think
about
6
or
8
years
as
a
circuit
judge.
at
one
time
he
serves
as
a
probe
judge
also.
mr.
david
w.
clark
walter
gillard,
i
believe.
and
i
don't
the
middle
initial.
mr.
david
w.
clark
palmer,
his
brother
i
believe
and
his
father
was
i
believe
palmer
gilliard
also.
he
was
our
senior
member
of
the
bar.
he
died
at
the
age
of
103.
now
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
--
they
as
a
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
notwithstanding
the
verdict,
i
believe
is
that
the
judge
could
send
it
back?
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
the
jury
didn't
agree
did
a
predetermined
sentence.
mr.
david
w.
clark
he
could
instruct
the
jury
just
on
that
matter.
he
thought
it
was
--
did
not
warrant
that
penalty.
however
in
alabama
your
death
penalty
is
provided
of
robbery
and
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
he'd
already
instructed
them
that
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
they
have
thought
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
don't
have
it
before
me
your
honor
but
there
have
been
cases
where
they
have
done
that.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
i
don't
have
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
now
there
was
something
brought
out
in
the
brief
about
the
finding
of
guilty
by
the
jury
and
the
fixing
of
the
sentence
by
that
same
jury
violated
his
constitutional
rights.
i
believe
this
honorable
court
in
a
footnote
in
giaccio
versus
pennsylvania
held
that
in
so
holding
we
intend
to
cast
no
doubt
whatever
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
settled
practice
in
many
states
to
lead
the
juries
fixing
defendant's
guilty
crime,
the
power
to
fix
punishment
within
legally
prescribed
limits.
now,
i
found
two
cases
when
courts
had
followed
that
one
is
in
california,
in
re
anderson,
california
supreme
court
on
november
18th
of
1968
filed
it.
that
was
in
a
murder
case
however
--
but
they
had
--
they
under
i
believe
section
160
of
their
criminal
code,
the
jury
could
find
the
person
guilty
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
and
under
the
section
160.1
the
same
jury
could
fix
his
punishment
at
either
death
or
life
imprisonment.
and
supreme
court
of
california
held
that
that
was
no
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights
and
this
same
thing
was
followed
in
the
supreme
court
of
washington,
washington
versus
smith
in
the
washington
supreme
court
on
october
29th,
1968.
and
the
last
paragraph
of
that
opinion
i
think
is
a
burden
here.
the
defendant's
argument
against
the
death
sentence
on
moral
and
practical
grounds
are
persuasive
however
they
should
be
addressed
to
the
legislature.
if
as
they
maintain
a
majority
of
people
today
are
impose
to
the
death
penalty
an
effort
to
get
the
legislature
to
eliminate
it
should
have
a
considerable
chance
of
success.
that's
our
contention
if
there's
objection
to
the
death
penalty.
the
proper
way
is
to
take
that
through
the
legislature
and
this
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
they
were
informed
and
the
jury
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
it
doesn't
appear
from
the
record
here
but
when
there
has
been
a
plea
of
guilty
in
alabama
the
jury
hears
a
prima
facie
case
to
determine
the
seriousness
of
the
crime.
mr.
david
w.
clark
to
determine
the
sentence.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
it
was
meant
--
principally
the
question
of
punishment.
there
had
been
a
plea
of
guilty
already.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
that
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
usually
when
they
enter
a
plea
of
guilty
to
murder
they'll
enter
a
plea
of
murder
to
the
second
degree
which
would
cover
the
life
sentence.
but
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
they
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
--
to
track
them
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
--
first
degree
murder.
mr.
david
w.
clark
they
go
to
trial.
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
know
of
no
case
in
which
that
has
happened
your
honor
that
they
held
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
i
know
of
none
but
i
had
in
practice
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
that's
correct.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that
is
not.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
i
believe
mr.
justice
black,
that's
the
answer
to
my
question.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
you
could
not
have
the
conviction
without
putting
on
a
prima
facie
case.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
it
would
not
be
on
this
robbery.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
think
that's
what
this
is.
mr.
david
w.
clark
he
could
so
instruct
the
jury.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that
no
prima
facie
case
was
made
out.
mr.
david
w.
clark
then
i'll
assume
the
defense
counsel
would
then
move
for
a
directive
verdict.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that
would
taint
the
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
not
to
my
knowledge.
prima
facie
case
wouldn't
take
too
much
to
put
on
your
honor
just
one
or
two
witnesses
at
the
most.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
that
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
that's
what
i
mentioned
a
while
ago,
would
it
satisfy
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes
of
course
they're
substantially
the
same
as
the
original
record.
mr.
david
w.
clark
however
--
oh,
you
--
i
get
what
you
mean
sir.
no,
sir.
you
are
assuming
that
he
did
not
because
it
does
not
appear
in
the
record,
is
that
correct?
mr.
david
w.
clark
and
i
believe
the
case
cite
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
now
the
case
of
o'connor
versus
cochran
that
he
cited
in
support
of
that
had
to
do
with
the
confession
i
believe
but
--
i
did
cite
a
case
wherein
it
--
there
was
no
particular
format
that
they
had
to
use
or
nothing
--
in
the
effect
on
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
but
all
it
appears
there
is
not
shown
in
the
record,
exactly
the
questions
he
asked.
mr.
david
w.
clark
if
he
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
that's
--
that's
all
the
spoken
and
written
words
that
were
transcribed
and
put
in
the
record
either
in
the
record
that
it
was
before
the
alabama
supreme
court
of
this
honorable
court.
however,
as
i've
pointed
and
i
cited
one
case
that
there's
nothing
that
requires
to
my
knowledge
that
it
appear
in
the
record
that
he
did
so
advised
and
in
fact
say,
mr.
boykin,
you
know
that
you
can
get
the
death
penalty.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that's
correct.
your
honor
i
believe
that
that
in
my
brief
explained
my
points
and
i
thank
you
for
your
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
your
honor
i
have
copies
of
mr.
gibbons'
both
of
his
briefs
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
they
had
been
in
my
folder
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
i
have
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
thank
you,
your
honor.
it's
always
a
pleasure
and
privilege
to
be
able
to.
mr.
david
w.
clark
may
i
state
to
the
court
that
i
consider
it
a
greatest
honor
that
i
have
received
during
my
legal
career.
