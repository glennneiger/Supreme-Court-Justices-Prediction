you
may,
you
may
mr.

mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
the
--
the
entire
trial
is
between
pages
10
and
page
31
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
of
the
record.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
a
court
not
inquired
into
the
voluntariness
of
a
plea
in
alabama?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
wouldn't
you
think
that
it
should
be
done
by
all
means
in
a
capital
case
where
a
man's
life
is
at
stake?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
wasn't
it
done
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
can
you
tell
us
whether
it
was
or
was
not
done?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
clark,
i
noticed
that
on
page
25
of
the
petitioner's
brief
that
he
raises
a
question,
a
guilty
plea
to
be
effective
must
be
made
voluntarily,
knowingly
and
intelligently.
and
he
says
a
trial
judge
has
an
affirmative
constitutional
duty
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
a
guilty
plea
was
voluntarily
made.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
if
we
take
this
record
as
it
is
in
this
transcript,
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
that
there
was
anything
done
by
the
court
to
determine
whether
it
was
voluntarily
made.
must
we
assume
that
this
is
all
that
the
court
went
on?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
if
we
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
we
entitled
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
we
must
decide
it
on
this
record,
that
that's
all
there
is
on
that
subject
matter.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
it
isn't
a
question
of
format,
there
was
absolutely
nothing
here,
that's
the
problem,
absolutely
nothing.
now,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
we
can
consider
to
negate
this
statement
that
a
trial
judge
has
an
affirmative
constitutional
duty
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
a
guilty
plea
was
voluntarily
made?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
we
decide
this
issue,
this
particular
issue,
are
we
entitled
to
decide
it
fairly
on
what
is
in
this
transcript
and
nothing
more?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
wasn't
asking
about
your
law,
i
was
asking
about
the
facts
in
this
case.
this
is
all
we
have
to
go.
