justice
abe
fortas
mr.
gibbons
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
may
i
ask
you
whether
that
last
point
was
raised
and
decided
below?
i've
looked
for
it
and
i
haven't
been
able
to
find
it.
justice
abe
fortas
if
it
is
--
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
show
me
where?
would
you
tell
me
where
it
is
because
i
have
looked
for
it
and
haven't
found
it?
justice
abe
fortas
there's
nothing
in
there,
the
decision
on
it.
there's
nothing
in
the
papers
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
we
have
before
us.
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
i
want
to
be
very
clear
on
this
mr.
gibbons
because
it's
a
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
jurisdictional
matter.
justice
abe
fortas
there
is
nothing
in
the
papers
before
us
that
shows
that
the
point
with
respect
to
them
--
your
argument
with
respect
to
the
need
for
standards
to
guide
the
jury
in
imposing
a
punishment.
there's
nothing
in
the
papers
before
us
that
shows
that
that
was
raised
and
decided
below,
am
i
right
or
wrong
about
that?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
gibbons,
as
i
understand
it,
you
are
here
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
the
alabama
statute
on
its
face
that
is
to
say
you're
saying
that
the
statute
is
bad
apart
from
its
--
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
would
cause
a
statute
authorizes
the
jury
to
fix
death
sentence
in
the
case
of
robert
and
you
point
out
that
alabama
used
the
common
law
definition
of
robbery.
under
--
i
don't
remember
saying
in
your
brief,
a
reference
to
just
how
alabama
views
the
definition
of
the
common
law
crime
of
robbery.
from
your
argument
i
take
it
that
any
sort
of
unlawful
taking,
they
need
force
--
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
now
are
there
states
in
which
the
crime
of
armed
robbery
is
punishable
by
death.
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
happened
here
was
in
fact
an
armed
robbery,
there
is
no
dispute
about
that
is
there
that
is
to
say
that
boykin
was
carrying
a
gun.
boykin
did
in
fact
use
the
gun
in
the
robbery.
boykin
did
in
fact
discharge
the
gun
and
in
fact
a
girl
in
the
store
was
wounded
in
the
calf
of
her
leg,
am
i
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
that
would
be
armed
robbery
within
the
definition
of
other
states,
right?
justice
abe
fortas
your
point
however
is
that
it's
not
necessary
--
is
your
point,
that
its
not
necessary
for
us
to
reach
the
constitutionality
of
the
armed
robbery
death
penalty
statutes
because
you
are
asking
us
to
consider
this
statute
on
its
phase
without
reference
to
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
but
here
your
problem
however
is
that
here
you
have
an
armed
robbery
and
you
have
an
armed
robbery
in
the
course
of
which
somebody
--
the
--
boykin
did
shoot
and
somebody
was
wounded
but
its
not
a
--
just
a
simple
unaggravated
robbery.
your
attack
must
be
and
well
i
suppose
you
wouldn't
be
averse
to
attacking
that
as
a
basis
for
the
death
penalty
but
the
other
prong
of
your
attack
i
take
is
that
the
statute
is
bad
or
over
breadth.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
clark
i
know
that
on
the
transcript
on
33,
as
the
judge
says,
it's
not
in
the
hands
of
--
it
is
now
in
the
hands
of
the
state
this
have
pronounced
the
sentence.
and
it
is
up
to
the
governor
if
he
cares
to
do
anything
about
it.
it's
not
up
to
the
trial
judge.
now,
could
we
--
could
you
tell
us
whether
he
has
--
whether
there
has
been
appeal
to
the
governor
in
this
case?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
automatic
or?
justice
abe
fortas
when
was
the
last
execution
in
alabama?
they
didn't
have
one
last
year,
did
you
have?
justice
abe
fortas
i
remember
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
the
entire
nation.
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
suppose
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
further
sir,
let's
suppose
that
a
defendant
were
tried
on
one
count
of
robbery
then
the
jury
has
a
problem
of
fixing
the
punishment,
is
there
any
--
i
don't
suppose
there's
anything
like
a
pre-sentence
report
or
any
evidence
introduced
as
to
his
history,
is
there?
what
is
your
practice?
is
there
any
effort
to
duplicate
in
front
of
the
jury
what
is
in
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
the
ordinary
pre-sentence
report
by
the
man's
family
background
and
what
kind
of
person
he's
been
and
whether
this
is
an
isolated
incident
or
part
of
a
long
history
of
crime,
the
sort
that
a
judge
usually
ask
before
him?
justice
abe
fortas
during
the
trial?
justice
abe
fortas
but
suppose
he
had
a
led
an
exemplary
life
and
suppose
his
counsel
decided
that
for
strategic
reasons
that
he
didn't
want
to
get
the
question
of
guilt
whether
you
did
this
or
not
makes
up
with
the
facts
about
the
man's
life
which
is
of
course
kind
of
thing,
conceivable,
i'd
badly
described
it
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
sure,
you'll
agree
that
it
is
conceivable
that
a
lawyer
might
make
a
strategic
judgment
of
that
sort.
then
the
jury
would
have
to
consider
punishment
without
anything
before
it
as
to
what
kind
of
man
this
is.
justice
abe
fortas
well
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
she
might
be
a
very,
very
critical
one
in
which
the
lawyer
makes
the
judgment
in
good
faith
and
with
professional
competence
that
he
later
desperately
regrets.
justice
abe
fortas
and
his
client
therefore
--
client
is
electrocuted,
he
probably
regrets
that
even
more.
justice
abe
fortas
well
--
justice
abe
fortas
now,
is
there
any
authority
from
that?
i
don't
--
as
i
read
this
perhaps
i'm
wrong,
perhaps
it's
a
little
different
from
the
way
my
brother
stewart
reads
it.
i
read
it
all
this
judge
thought
he
could
is
to
make
a
recommendation
for
clemency
which
will
be
to
the
governor.
when
you
read
the
first
couple
of
sentences
of
what
he
said
there
but
can
i
know
judge's
--
trial
judges
can
do
things
that
aren't
always
strictly
according
to
the
book
i
suppose
but
is
there
any
authority
in
the
law
for
him
to
send
the
case
back
to
the
jury
and
ask
him
to
tell,
instruct
them
to
reconsider
their
verdict.
justice
abe
fortas
they
have
done
it
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
but
you
don't
know
of
any
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
statutory
or
case
law
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
approves
it.
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
--
i'm
sorry
to
ask
you
so
many
questions.
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
nature
of
the
trial
here,
now
robbery
is
a
capital
offense?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
court
does
not
--
does
the
court
accept
the
guilty
without
more
or
is
this
a
trial
on
the
question
of
guilt?
was
the
jury
informed
that
the
defendant
had
pleaded
guilty?
justice
abe
fortas
that
doesn't
appear
here,
does
it?
but
they
are
informed
that
the
defendant
had
pleaded
guilty?
justice
abe
fortas
to
deter
--
in
other
words
--
justice
abe
fortas
so
do
you
argue
that
in
the
sense,
this
is
not
a
unitary
trial,
what
happened
here
in
the
sense
that
this
trial
was
on
the
question
of
punishment?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
that
plea
of
guilty
is
accepted
in
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
alabama
even
if
--
suppose
this
had
been
a
murder
case,
is
it
a
custom
on
alabama
to
accept
a
plea
of
guilty?
justice
abe
fortas
but
it's
clear
--
you
don't
know
of
any
situation
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
a
plea
of
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
guilt.
justice
abe
fortas
they
--
they
go
to
trial?
justice
abe
fortas
and
they
don't
accept
the
plea
of
guilty.
justice
abe
fortas
but
despite
the
fact
that
the
ultimate
result
may
be
the
same
here
namely
electrocution.
in
a
robbery
case,
the
court
will
accept
and
lay
before
the
jury
the
plea
of
guilty.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
so
it's
not
just
a
penalty
to
trial
as
perhaps
you
stated
and
i
didn't
get
the
implications
of
it.
this
is
something
more
than
just
a
penalty
trial,
its
penalty
trial
plus
a
trial
in
which
a
prima
facie
case
is
made
that
the
guilty
plea
is
warranted?
justice
abe
fortas
after
a
plea
of
guilty?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
gibbons
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
may
i
ask
you
whether
that
last
point
was
raised
and
decided
below?
i've
looked
for
it
and
i
haven't
been
able
to
find
it.
justice
abe
fortas
if
it
is
--
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
show
me
where?
would
you
tell
me
where
it
is
because
i
have
looked
for
it
and
haven't
found
it?
justice
abe
fortas
there's
nothing
in
there,
the
decision
on
it.
there's
nothing
in
the
papers
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
we
have
before
us.
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
i
want
to
be
very
clear
on
this
mr.
gibbons
because
it's
a
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
jurisdictional
matter.
justice
abe
fortas
there
is
nothing
in
the
papers
before
us
that
shows
that
the
point
with
respect
to
them
--
your
argument
with
respect
to
the
need
for
standards
to
guide
the
jury
in
imposing
a
punishment.
there's
nothing
in

that

that
that
was
raised

below,
am
i
right
or
wrong
about

justice
abe
fortas
mr.

as
i

it,
you
are

attacking
the

under

a

to
just
how
alabama
views
the
definition
of
the

from
your
argument
i
take
it
that
any
sort
of
unlawful
taking,
they
need
force
--
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
now
are
there
states
in
which
the
crime
of
armed
robbery
is
punishable
by
death.
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
happened
here
was
in
fact
an
armed
robbery,
there
is
no
dispute
about
that
is
there
that
is
to
say
that
boykin
was
carrying
a
gun.
boykin
did
in

use
the
gun
in
the
robbery.
boykin
did
in
fact
discharge
the
gun
and
in
fact
a
girl
in
the
store
was
wounded
in
the
calf
of
her
leg,
am
i
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
that
would
be
armed
robbery
within
the
definition
of
other
states,
right?
justice
abe
fortas
your
point
however
is
that
it's
not
necessary
--
is
your
point,
that
its
not
necessary
for
us
to
reach
the
constitutionality
of

death

because

asking

is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
but
here
your
problem
however
is
that
here
you
have
an
armed
robbery
and
you
have
an
armed

in
the
course
of
which
somebody
--
the
--
boykin
did

the
court
does
not
--
does
the
court
accept
the
guilty
without
more
or
is
this
a
trial
on
the
question
of
guilt?
was
the
jury
informed
that
the
defendant
had
pleaded
guilty?
justice
abe
fortas
that
doesn't
appear
here,
does
it?
but
they
are
informed
that
the
defendant
had
pleaded
guilty?
justice
abe
fortas
to
deter
--
in
other
words
--
justice
abe
fortas
so
do
you
argue
that
in
the
sense,
this
is
not
a
unitary
trial,
what
happened
here
in
the
sense
that
this
trial
was
on
the
question
of
punishment?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
that
plea
of
guilty
is
accepted
in
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
alabama
even
if
--
suppose
this
had
been
a
murder
case,
is
it
a
custom
on
alabama
to
accept
a
plea
of
guilty?
justice
abe
fortas
but
it's
clear
--
you
don't
know
of
any
situation
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
a
plea
of
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
guilt.
justice
abe
fortas
they
--
they
go
to
trial?
justice
abe
fortas
and
they
don't
accept
the
plea
of
guilty.
justice
abe
fortas
but
despite
the
fact
that
the
ultimate
result
may
be
the
same
here
namely
electrocution.
in
a
robbery
case,
the
court
will
accept
and
lay
before
the
jury
the
plea
of
guilty.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
so
it's
not
just
a
penalty
to
trial
as
perhaps
you
stated
and
i
didn't
get
the
implications
of
it.
this
is
something
more
than
just
a
penalty
trial,
its
penalty
trial
plus
a
trial
in
which
a
prima
facie
case
is
made
that
the
guilty
plea
is
warranted?
justice
abe
fortas
after
a
plea
of
guilty?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
