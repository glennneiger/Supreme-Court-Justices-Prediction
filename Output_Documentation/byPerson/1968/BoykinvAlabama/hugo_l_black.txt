black
you
mean
robbery,
don't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
difference
between
common
law
robbery
--
what
is
it
that
the
other
states
have
that
alabama
doesn't
have?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
adds
what
to
attacking
a
man,
threatening
with
a
weapon,
threatening
to
kill
him
and
so
forth,
and
talking
his
money,
what
does
it
add
to
that,
the
other
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
aggra
--
i
mean,
what
conduct,
what
does
he
have
to
do
in
addition
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
all
this
common
--
all
statutory
robberies
as
i
understand
it
based
on
the
fact
that
one
meets
another
or
find
him,
threatened
him
with
a
weapon,
if
he
doesn't
give
him
his
property
and
takes
it
away
from
him
or
tries
to,
isn't
that
statutory
robbery
as
well
as
common
law
robbery?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
conceivable.
did
you
ever
hear
of
a
thing
like
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean,
you've
never
heard
of
anybody
being
convicted
robbery
without
killing
somebody?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
know
what's
the
custom
now,
but
it
certainly
it
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
50
years
ago,
it
was
said
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
each
life.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
victim
and
the
person
who
does
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
threatened
victim,
his
life's
pretty
dear
too,
isn't
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
is
not
available
and
assuming
that
the
practice
is
as
it
--
as
i
know
it
to
be
it
was
not
transcribed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
his
name?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
is
this
jury
selected?
the
ordinary
method
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
at
the
beginning
of
the
week,
the
sheriff
brings
in
jurors
names
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
they're
selected
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
judge
then
qualifies
them
as
to
whether
or
not
they're
able
to
serve
the
jurors
on
account
of
their
age.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
during
the
week,
they
divide
it
up
and
the
man
hasn't
decided
a
question
which
says
special
qualification
in
regard
to
a
particular
case,
they
ask
questions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
that
he
was
qualified
at
the
beginning
of
the
week,
i
assume.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
still
the
law
in
alabama
that
good
character
alone
could
be
charged
to
the
jury
sufficient
to
generate
a
reasonable
doubt
of
guilt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
tried
the
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
has
he
been
a
judge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
are
his
initials?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
he
in
the
span
of
palmer
gillard?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
they
plead
guilty
to
murder
in
the
first
degree
unless
it's
changed
that
time,
was
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
law
--
the
judge
is
required
to
call
a
jury,
give
the
jury
enough
evidence
to
show
a
prima
facie
case
just
that
number
of
witnesses
and
to
show
--
give
the
jury
enough
information
on
which
it
supposedly
he
could
--
they
could
rest
a
verdict.
and
that's
the
way
it's
done
and
by
the
first
--
it
was
done
in
that
way
in
the
first
place.
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
that
been
changed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
have
a
very
vivid
recollection
of
that
practice,
i
thought
i
was
appointed
and
the
--
it
was
--
a
jury
was
called,
a
jury
was
selected,
i
had
a
trade
whereby
he
was
not
to
get
this,
the
jury
came
back
and
tried
to
defy
the
court's
order.
they
wanted
to
give
him
a
death
sentence
on
a
prima
facie
case
and
the
judge
find
--
they
told
them
they
could
give
it
to
him
but
he
set
it
aside.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
all
they
accepted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
the
practice
--
that
was
the
practice
then
to
my
knowledge.
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
the
sentence
had
been
stayed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
i
have
a
copy
the
state's
brief
also,
i
guess
