mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
edward
boykin
jr.
who
is
the
only
man
in
america
that
awaits
execution
for
the
crime
of
common
law
robbery.
and
if
he
is
permitted
to
die
will
be
the
sixth
man
to
be
executed
by
the
state
of
alabama
in
almost
40
years
for
that
crime.
this
case
is
before
this
court
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
that
court
by
a
four
to
three
decision
affirmed
five
death
sentences.
edward
boykin
was
brought
to
trial
on
five
separate
indictments
for
robbery.
and
a
plea
of
guilty
was
entered
and
on
that
plea
he
was
sentenced
to
death
five
times.
now,
this
case
as
i
see
it
raises
three
great
constitutional
issues.
the
first
one
is
that
it
violates
the
constitution,
the
due
process
clause
for
a
conviction
to
be
based
upon
a
plea
of
guilty
where
in
the
record
of
trial
there
is
no
affirmative
showing
that
that
plea
was
voluntarily
and
understandingly
given.
secondly,
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
for
the
common
law
robbery
violates
the
provision
of
the
cruel
and
unusual
eighth
amendment
clause.
and
thirdly,
a
statute
which
allows
a
jury
unfettered
discretion
in
a
capital
case
violates
the
petitioner's
right
to
due
process.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
now
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
yes,
it
was
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
--
raised
below.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
well,
it
was
raised
in
my
brief,
i
do
not
know
whether
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
considered
it
or
not.
their
decision
indicates
that
they
did
not.
but
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
no.
no,
sir.
that
there
is
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
there
is
no
treatment
in
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
decision
as
to
that
point.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
now
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
well
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
i
would
--
the
only
thing
i
can
say
is
that
it
was
raised
in
the
court
below.
it
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
i
don't
know.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
i
don't
know
about
whether
it
is
or
not.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
well,
what
i
was
just
about
to
say
was
that
in
view
of
the
oral
argument
on
that
specific
point
that's
going
to
be
presented
in
maxwell
against
bishop
that
in
the
time
limitation
that
i
have,
i'm
going
to
address
myself
to
the
first
two
issues
that
i
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
well,
it
was
raised
below
in
this
sense
that
under
the
automatic
appeal
statute
in
alabama
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
must
look
at
the
entire
record.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
and
certainly
it
was
raised
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
well,
they
certainly
noted
that
because
three
justices
in
alabama
wanted
to
reverse
on
that
first
issue
which
i'm
raising
--
in
which
i
intend
to
argue
about
now.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
no,
sir.
i
did
not
submit
that
issue
in
my
brief
below.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
that
was
raised
by
the
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
no,
sir.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
no,
sir.
now,
if
i
may
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
he
had
a
court
appointed
attorney.
i
might
explain
to
the
court
here
that
i'm
in
the
same
position
you
all
are
because
i
entered
this
case
at
the
trial
--
at
the
appellate
level.
i
was
--
i
was
not
even
in
the
case
until
after
the
sentence
was
given
and
everything.
now,
addressing
myself,
if
i
may
to
this
point
that
the
due
process
clause
requires
that
a
trial
record
show
affirmatively
that
the
plea
of
guilty
was
voluntarily
and
understandingly
made,
i
think
there
are
three
points
of
reasoning
that
inevitably
draw
us
to
that
conclusion.
the
first
is
and
i
don't
think
it's
arguable
that
a
plea
of
guilty
must
be
voluntarily
and
understandingly
made.
that's
because
as
we
--
i
think
we
all
realize
that
a
plea
of
guilty
is
an
admission
of
guilt.
it's
a
con
--
judicial
confession
in
effect.
and
certainly
the
waiver
of
such
a
fundamental
right
to
contest
guilt
to
give
the
prosecution
the
whole
vote
so
to
speak.
the
waiver
of
that
right
is
so
fundamental
that
i
don't
think
it's
arguable.
that
it
should
be
voluntarily
and
understandingly
given.
now
secondly,
that
in
order
to
be
meaningful,
it
must
be
affirmative.
and
this
affirmative
procedural
step
must
appear
on
the
record
because
--
what
i'm
saying
here
is
this,
that
if
you
look
at
this
record
right
here,
you
do
not
know
and
i
do
not
know
whether
edward
boykin
entered
his
plea
of
guilty
voluntarily
and
understandingly.
and
yet
he
is
going
to
have
to
die
because
of
the
barrenness
of
this
record.
and
it's
a
simple
thing.
it
--
by
analogy
it's
the
same
reasoning
that
this
court
used
in
the
miranda
decision.
there,
there
was
a
question
of
a
waiver.
there
was
a
--
and
this
court
said
that
if
a
--
in
a
trial
court,
if
you're
going
to
introduce
an
out
of
court
confession
then
you
--
then
the
record
must
affirmatively
show
that
that
confession
was
obtained
voluntarily
and
understandingly.
the
--
the
same
thing
is
true
that
we
are
asking
here.
if
you're
going
to
rely
on
a
plea
of
guilty
then
the
record
ought
to
show
and
--
we
wouldn't
have
this
trouble
right
here.
this
question
wouldn't
be
before
the
court.
it
wouldn't
give
the
trouble
to
the
supreme
court
that
it
gave
them
if
a
--
as
--
the
same
sort
of
litany
that
--
that's
in
the
record
about
indigency.
if
you
had
just
a
trial
court
determining
be
ensured
that
the
fellow
knew
that
when
he
plead
guilty,
he
was
subjecting
himself
to
the
maximum
punishment.
now,
i'd
like
to
comment
about
this
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
--
record.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
well,
i
don't
think
that
has
too
much
to
do
with
the
--
the
issue
that
i'm
trying
to
speak
about
here
for
the
reason
that
that
common
after
the
a
plea.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
well
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
no,
sir.
that's
not
the
alabama
law.
the
--
the
alabama
law
is
that
you
put
on
a
prima
facie
case
as
a
sort
of
penalty
trial
where
you
determine
the
--
you
let
the
jury
see
what
kind
of
a
case
it
was.
but
a
plea
of
guilty
in
alabama
is
conviction
of
the
offense.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
that's
right.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
but
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
yes
,
sir.
now,
looking
at
this
record,
its
35
pages
for
which
a
man's
going
to
die
for
and
all
that's
in
it
is
an
--
the
first
page
is
an
indictment
talking
about
robbery
not
the
death
penalty.
it
sets
bail
at
$2,500.00.
there
is
a
proceeding
of
determining
indigency
while
the
fellow
is
asked,
do
you
need
an
attorney
and
he
says
no.
there
is
in
this
record
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses,
the
complaining
witnesses
and
then
the
first
time
that
the
death
penalty
is
mentioned
is
in
the
almost
pro
forma
instructions
of
the
judge
when
he
gives
the
jury
two
forms.
if
you're
going
to
give
him
imprisonment,
you
use
this
form.
if
you're
going
to
use
death,
you
use
this
form.
and
then
at
that
time
the
jury
goes
out
and
comes
back
in
and
edward
boykin
is
to
die
and
that's
all
that
this
record
shows
and
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
say
today.
now,
i
just
believe
that
the
constitution
due
process
clause
requires
that
that
this
affirmative
showing
be
made.
i'd
like
now
to
turn
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
there
was
no
motion
at
any
time.
no,
sir.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
yes,
sir.
there
is.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
well,
the
day
of
the
sentence
starts
the
running
of
the
time
when
you
can
file
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
that's
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
well
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
he
--
he
didn't
set
the
date
until
the
next
day
when
the
defendant
was
finally
brought
back
in
for
proper
sentencing
as
to
form.
but
the
30-day
limitation
run
--
started
running
on
the
day
of
sentence
which
is
21st
of
september.
well
now,
i
didn't
get
in
this
case
until
the
27th
of
october
when
a
friend
of
mine
told
me
that
he
want
--
he
couldn't
prosecute
the
appeal
and
would
i
take
it
and
that
time
i
got
into
it.
but
any
sort
of
motion
for
a
new
trial,
the
grounds,
excessiveness
of
that
sort
of
thing,
that's
all
waived
unless
you
raise
it
on
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
you
see,
the
automatic
appeal
statute
in
alabama
came
prior
or
was
enacted
prior
to
gideon
against
wainwright
about
this
counsel
but
you
have
an
automatic
appeal
but
you'd
--
you
don't
get
an
automatic
attorney.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
on
that
appeal,
you've
got
to
ask
for
it.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
well,
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
some
of
the
grounds
i'm
raising
now
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
but
principally
the
excessiveness
of
the
penalty
in
the
light
of
the
offense.
nobody,
nobody
expected
--
i
can
only
conjecture
about
this
record
just
as
anybody
can.
but
alabama
gives
the
penalty
for
robbery
about
once
every
eight
years.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
could
have
been
filed
and
heard
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
he
had
court
appointed
counsel
for
the
trial.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
his
duties
under
alabama
practice
are
over
when
the
senate
comes
in.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
well,
it's
the
view
that
attorney's
take.
i
personally
take
the
view
that
it
goes
all
the
way
through
parole.
if
--
if
he
needs
help,
even
after
he
gets
parole,
if
he
gets
a
sentence
but
technically
or
by
application,
the
trial
appointed
--
court
appointed
attorney's
duties
are
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
oh!
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
i
--
i
believe
it
would,
yes.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
if
any
--
before
submission
to
the
jury.
now,
in
--
i'd
like
to
address
my
further
argument
to
the
second
point
and
that
is
the
question
of
applying
the
provision
of
the
eighth
amendment
prescription,
approval
and
unusual
against
the
death
--
against
the
offense
of
a
common
law
robbery.
now,
this
is
a
direct
attack
upon
title
14,
section
415
of
the
code
of
alabama
which
is
the
penalty
statute
for
the
common
offense
of
robbery
and
we
all
know
that
the
common
law
offense
of
robbery
is
the
its
essential's
elements
are
the
taking
of
property
with
--
from
a
person
with
the
violence
or
with
a
threat
of
violence.
now,
the
attack
on
this
statute
is
because
the
breadth
and
range
of
it,
a
simple
assault
with
a
larceny
can
give
you
the
death
penalty
under
this
statute.
now,
in
application
of
this
provision
of
the
eighth
amendment,
this
court
has
indicated
certain
standards
or
certain
things
that
they
look
at.
one
of
them
is
that
it's
not
a
static
concept.
that's
its
not
a
non-progressive
thing
that
it
moves
with
the
times
and
that
they've
in
--
even
indicated
--
you
have
even
indicated
in
an
--
a
more
enlightened
society,
it
might
encompass
greater
and
greater
things
and
i
am
saying
to
this
court
today
that
alabama
is
the
only
state
that
has
this
common
law
offense
of
robbery
with
the
death
penalty.
and
i
submit
that
in
the
light
of
this
court's
decisions,
decisions
such
as
weems
60
years
ago
when
this
court
knocked
down
a
punishment
where
a
feller
--
he
falsified
some
government
documents
and
he
got
12
years
imprisonment
and
loss
of
his
civil
rights.
this
court
at
that
time
1910
said
that
that
one
of
the
standards
is
the
disproportionate,
disproportionality
of
the
offense
with
the
punished.
now,
looking
directly
at
alabama,
alabama
--
the
crime
of
unpremeditated
murder
with
malice
in
alabama,
the
maximum
punishment
is
life
imprisonment
yet
for
larceny,
and
a
simple
assault,
you
can
get
the
death
penalty.
i
respectfully
submit
that
that
this
standard
of
disproportionality
is
applicable
to
edward
boykin.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
yes,
sir.
robbery,
common
law
robbery
as
it
is.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
well,
the
other
states
have
a
statutory
form
of
robbery
classifying
it
in
aggravation
such
as
armed
robbery.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
well,
it
adds
the
description
of
aggravation.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
well,
in
a
statutorily
--
in
an
armed
robbery
statute
he
has
to
be
armed
or
he
has
to
kill
somebody
or
whatever
classification
or
qualification
these
statutes
give
it.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
no,
sir.
in
common
law
robbery
you
can
have
conceivably
a
school
boy
in
a
corridor,
in
a
high
school
in
alabama
can
snatch
a
book
away
from
another
student
and
under
the
statute
in
alabama
he
can
get
death.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
no,
sir.
i
never
have
nor
have
i
ever
heard
of
really
in
terms
of
thinking
that
a
feller
who
didn't
kill
anybody
wouldn't
get
death,
wouldn't
sacrifice
his
own
life
for
it.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
no,
sir.
i'm
saying
that
it
is
shocking
to
think
even
under
the
judeo-christian
concepts
that
we
work
on
that
a
life
must
be
taken
when
no
life
was
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
--
was
taken.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
well
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
well
your
honor,
i
am
not
up
here
saying
that
robbery
is
not
a
serious
crime.
it
is
most
serious
but
we
got
to
recognize
that
life
is
a
fundamental
thing,
life
is
a
fundamental
right
too.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
each
life.
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
yes,
sir.
they
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
most
dear.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
witherspoon.
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
that
--
that
maybe
so
but
the
record
here
doesn't
disclose,
i
mean
i
know
or
i
can
--
it's
conjecture,
i
don't
want
to
go
outside
the
record
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
--
but
the
practice
is,
to
qualify
them
as
--
have
they
been
doing
for
a
long
time.
and
that
is
if
you've
got
--
i
think
--
i
think
if
it
appeared
in
the
record,
you
would
have
a
contravention
with
the
witherspoon
case.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
there
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
oh,
the
--
they
hold
that
it's
a
challenge
for
cause
if
a
perspective
juror
has
any
hesitancy
in
giving
the
death
penalty.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
a
taking
with
violence
or
with
the
threat
of
violence.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
yes,
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
that's
correct
sir.
a
--
aside
from
what
this
court
may
think
of
murder,
say,
as
justifying
the
death
penalty,
the
question
before
the
court
as
i
see
it
and
the
issue
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
the
death
penalty
for
robbery
is
cruel
and
unusual,
is
disproportionate,
it
--
it
comes
in
a
time
when
no
other
state
except
alabama
applies
and
it
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
is
bad
on
its
face
because
of
the
expanse
and
range
to
which
it
can
be
applied.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
reserve
whatever
time
i
have
left
for
rebuttal.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
thank
you.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
just
a
couple
of
comments
in
rebuttal.
one
is
with
regard
to
the
post-conviction
remedy
that
the
attorney
general
suggests
that
edward
boykin
might
follow.
i
--
when
i
get
back
to
mobile,
i
might
be
able
to
think
of
ten
or
eleven
more,
but
i
can
think
of
three
right
now.
one
is
that
he
might
be
dead
before
somebody
gets
interested
in
filing
a
post-conviction
remedy.
the
second
is
that
in
a
post
--
in
a
post-conviction
remedy
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
sir,
it
has
been
stayed
by
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
pending
the
hearing
in
this
court.
secondly,
he
has
no
right
of
attorney.
the
attorney
general
indicates
that
he
has
it
as
a
matter
of
right
and
yet
here's
an
excerpt
from
the
code
of
alabama
and
the
first
case
annotated
under
this
section
of
appointment
of
counsel
for
a
coram
nobis
hearing
is
that
the
trial
judge
in
his
discretion
can
determine
whether
he
gets
appointed
counsel
or
not.
and
the
third
ground
that
post-conviction
remedy
is
not
satisfactory
is
that
in
a
post-conviction
remedy,
the
petitioner
has
the
burden
of
proof.
he
has
already
sacrificed
his
cloak
of
innocence.
he's
already
sacrificed
the
court's
scrutiny
of
his
fundamental
rights
because
in
a
post-conviction
remedy
hearing,
he
has
to
prove
and
i
submit
that
this
court
holding
that
in
a
trial
in
a
capital
case
if
the
record
must
affirmatively
disclose,
then
think
of
the
burdens
that
post-conviction
remedies
would
solve.
it'd
take
a
lot
of
burden
off
of
courts
to
jut
ask
for
--
just
to
apply
this
simple
rule.
edward
boykin
wouldn't
need
a
post-conviction
remedy
if
the
record
affirmatively
showed
--
now,
there's
another
point
if
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
--
if
i
may
just
say
it
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
there
is
no
automatic
clemency
hearing
that
i
know
of
in
alabama.
if
he
has
an
attorney,
he
can
ask
for
it
but
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
says
he
has
it
as
a
matter
of
right.
thank
you.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
yes,
sir.
and
the
--
your
honor
that's
two
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
i've
submitted
two
briefs.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
i
--
i
submitted
two
briefs.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
here?
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
edward
boykin
jr.
who
is
the
only
man
in
america
that
awaits
execution
for
the
crime
of
common
law
robbery.
and
if
he
is
permitted
to
die
will
be
the
sixth
man
to
be
executed
by
the
state
of
alabama
in
almost
40
years
for
that
crime.
this
case
is
before
this
court
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
that
court
by
a
four
to
three
decision
affirmed
five
death
sentences.
edward
boykin
was
brought
to
trial
on
five
separate
indictments
for
robbery.
and
a
plea
of
guilty
was
entered
and
on
that
plea
he
was
sentenced
to
death
five
times.
now,
this
case
as
i
see
it
raises
three
great
constitutional
issues.
the
first
one
is
that
it
violates
the
constitution,
the
due
process
clause
for
a
conviction
to
be
based
upon
a
plea
of
guilty
where
in
the
record
of
trial
there
is
no
affirmative
showing
that
that
plea
was
voluntarily
and
understandingly
given.
secondly,
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
for
the
common
law
robbery
violates
the
provision
of
the
cruel
and
unusual
eighth
amendment
clause.
and
thirdly,
a
statute
which
allows
a
jury
unfettered
discretion
in
a
capital
case
violates
the
petitioner's
right
to
due
process.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
now
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
yes,
it
was
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
--
raised
below.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
well,
it
was
raised
in
my
brief,
i
do
not
know
whether
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
considered
it
or
not.
their
decision
indicates
that
they
did
not.
but
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
no.
no,
sir.
that
there
is
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
there
is
no
treatment
in
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
decision
as
to
that
point.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
now
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
well
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
i
would
--
the
only
thing
i
can
say
is
that
it
was
raised
in
the
court
below.
it
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
i
don't
know.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
i
don't
know
about
whether
it
is
or
not.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
well,
what
i
was
just
about
to
say
was
that
in
view
of
the
oral
argument
on
that
specific
point
that's
going
to
be
presented
in
maxwell
against
bishop
that
in
the
time
limitation
that
i
have,
i'm
going
to
address
myself
to
the
first
two
issues
that
i
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
well,
it
was
raised
below
in
this
sense
that
under
the
automatic
appeal
statute
in
alabama
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
must
look
at
the
entire
record.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
and
certainly
it
was
raised
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
well,
they
certainly
noted
that
because
three
justices
in
alabama
wanted
to
reverse
on
that
first
issue
which
i'm
raising
--
in
which
i
intend
to
argue
about
now.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
no,
sir.
i
did
not
submit
that
issue
in
my
brief
below.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
that
was
raised
by
the
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
no,
sir.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
no,
sir.
now,
if
i
may
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
he
had
a
court
appointed
attorney.
i
might
explain
to
the
court
here
that
i'm
in
the
same
position
you
all
are
because
i
entered
this
case
at
the
trial
--
at
the
appellate
level.
i
was
--
i
was
not
even
in
the
case
until
after
the
sentence
was
given
and
everything.
now,
addressing
myself,
if
i
may
to
this
point
that
the
due
process
clause
requires
that
a
trial
record
show
affirmatively
that
the
plea
of
guilty
was
voluntarily
and
understandingly
made,
i
think
there
are
three
points
of
reasoning
that
inevitably
draw
us
to
that
conclusion.
the
first
is
and
i
don't
think
it's
arguable
that
a
plea
of
guilty
must
be
voluntarily
and
understandingly
made.
that's
because
as
we
--
i
think
we
all
realize
that
a
plea
of
guilty
is
an
admission
of
guilt.
it's
a
con
--
judicial
confession
in
effect.
and
certainly
the
waiver
of
such
a
fundamental
right
to
contest
guilt
to
give
the
prosecution
the
whole
vote
so
to
speak.
the
waiver
of
that
right
is
so
fundamental
that
i
don't
think
it's
arguable.
that
it
should
be
voluntarily
and
understandingly
given.
now
secondly,
that
in
order
to
be
meaningful,
it
must
be
affirmative.
and
this
affirmative
procedural
step
must
appear
on
the
record
because
--
what
i'm
saying
here
is
this,
that
if
you
look
at
this
record
right
here,
you
do
not
know
and
i
do
not
know
whether
edward
boykin
entered
his
plea
of
guilty
voluntarily
and
understandingly.
and
yet
he
is
going
to
have
to
die
because
of
the
barrenness
of
this
record.
and
it's
a
simple
thing.
it
--
by
analogy
it's
the
same
reasoning
that
this
court
used
in
the
miranda
decision.
there,
there
was
a
question
of
a
waiver.
there
was
a
--
and
this
court
said
that
if
a
--
in
a
trial
court,
if
you're
going
to
introduce
an
out
of
court
confession
then
you
--
then
the
record
must
affirmatively
show
that
that
confession
was
obtained
voluntarily
and
understandingly.
the
--
the
same
thing
is
true
that
we
are
asking
here.
if
you're
going
to
rely
on
a
plea
of
guilty
then
the
record
ought
to
show
and
--
we
wouldn't
have
this
trouble
right
here.
this
question
wouldn't
be
before
the
court.
it
wouldn't
give
the
trouble
to
the
supreme
court
that
it
gave
them
if
a
--
as
--
the
same
sort
of
litany
that
--
that's
in
the
record
about
indigency.
if
you
had
just
a
trial
court
determining
be
ensured
that
the
fellow
knew
that
when
he
plead
guilty,
he
was
subjecting
himself
to
the
maximum
punishment.
now,
i'd
like
to
comment
about
this
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
--
record.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
well,
i
don't
think
that
has
too
much
to
do
with
the
--
the
issue
that
i'm
trying
to
speak
about
here
for
the
reason
that
that
common
after
the
a
plea.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
well
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
no,
sir.
that's
not
the
alabama
law.
the
--
the
alabama
law
is
that
you
put
on
a
prima
facie
case
as
a
sort
of
penalty
trial
where
you
determine
the
--
you
let
the
jury
see
what
kind
of
a
case
it
was.
but
a
plea
of
guilty
in
alabama
is
conviction
of
the
offense.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
that's
right.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
but
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
yes
,
sir.
now,
looking
at
this
record,
its
35
pages
for
which
a
man's
going
to
die
for
and
all
that's
in
it
is
an
--
the
first
page
is
an
indictment
talking
about
robbery
not
the
death
penalty.
it
sets
bail
at
$2,500.00.
there
is
a
proceeding
of
determining
indigency
while
the
fellow
is
asked,
do
you
need
an
attorney
and
he
says
no.
there
is
in
this
record
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses,
the
complaining
witnesses
and
then
the
first
time
that
the
death
penalty
is
mentioned
is
in
the
almost
pro
forma
instructions
of
the
judge
when
he
gives
the
jury
two
forms.
if
you're
going
to
give
him
imprisonment,
you
use
this
form.
if
you're
going
to
use
death,
you
use
this
form.
and
then
at
that
time
the
jury
goes
out
and
comes
back
in
and
edward
boykin
is
to
die
and
that's
all
that
this
record
shows
and
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
say
today.
now,
i
just
believe
that
the
constitution
due
process
clause
requires
that
that
this
affirmative
showing
be
made.
i'd
like
now
to
turn
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
there
was
no
motion
at
any
time.
no,
sir.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
yes,
sir.
there
is.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
well,
the
day
of
the
sentence
starts
the
running
of
the
time
when
you
can
file
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
that's
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
well
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
he
--
he
didn't
set
the
date
until
the
next
day
when
the
defendant
was
finally
brought
back
in
for
proper
sentencing
as
to
form.
but
the
30-day
limitation
run
--
started
running
on
the
day
of
sentence
which
is
21st
of
september.
well
now,
i
didn't
get
in
this
case
until
the
27th
of
october
when
a
friend
of
mine
told
me
that
he
want
--
he
couldn't
prosecute
the
appeal
and
would
i
take
it
and
that
time
i
got
into
it.
but
any
sort
of
motion
for
a
new
trial,
the
grounds,
excessiveness
of
that
sort
of
thing,
that's
all
waived
unless
you
raise
it
on
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
you
see,
the
automatic
appeal
statute
in
alabama
came
prior
or
was
enacted
prior
to
gideon
against
wainwright
about
this
counsel
but
you
have
an
automatic
appeal
but
you'd
--
you
don't
get
an
automatic
attorney.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
on
that
appeal,
you've
got
to
ask
for
it.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
well,
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
some
of
the
grounds
i'm
raising
now
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
but
principally
the
excessiveness
of
the
penalty
in
the
light
of
the
offense.
nobody,
nobody
expected
--
i
can
only
conjecture
about
this
record
just
as
anybody
can.
but
alabama
gives
the
penalty
for
robbery
about
once
every
eight
years.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
could
have
been
filed
and
heard
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
he
had
court
appointed
counsel
for
the
trial.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
his
duties
under
alabama
practice
are
over
when
the
senate
comes
in.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
well,
it's
the
view
that
attorney's
take.
i
personally
take
the
view
that
it
goes
all
the
way
through
parole.
if
--
if
he
needs
help,
even
after
he
gets
parole,
if
he
gets
a
sentence
but
technically
or
by
application,
the
trial
appointed
--
court
appointed
attorney's
duties
are
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
oh!
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
i
--
i
believe
it
would,
yes.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
if
any
--
before
submission
to
the
jury.
now,
in
--
i'd
like
to
address
my
further
argument
to
the
second
point
and
that
is
the
question
of
applying
the
provision
of
the
eighth
amendment
prescription,
approval
and
unusual
against
the
death
--
against
the
offense
of
a
common
law
robbery.
now,
this
is
a
direct
attack
upon
title
14,
section
415
of
the
code
of
alabama
which
is
the
penalty
statute
for
the
common
offense
of
robbery
and
we
all
know
that
the
common
law
offense
of
robbery
is
the
its
essential's
elements
are
the
taking
of
property
with
--
from
a
person
with
the
violence
or
with
a
threat
of
violence.
now,
the
attack
on
this
statute
is
because
the
breadth
and
range
of
it,
a
simple
assault
with
a
larceny
can
give
you
the
death
penalty
under
this
statute.
now,
in
application
of
this
provision
of
the
eighth
amendment,
this
court
has
indicated
certain
standards
or
certain
things
that
they
look
at.
one
of
them
is
that
it's
not
a
static
concept.
that's
its
not
a
non-progressive
thing
that
it
moves
with
the
times
and
that
they've
in
--
even
indicated
--
you
have
even
indicated
in
an
--
a
more
enlightened
society,
it
might
encompass
greater
and
greater
things
and
i
am
saying
to
this
court
today
that
alabama
is
the
only
state
that
has
this
common
law
offense
of
robbery
with
the
death
penalty.
and
i
submit
that
in
the
light
of
this
court's
decisions,
decisions
such
as
weems
60
years
ago
when
this
court
knocked
down
a
punishment
where
a
feller
--
he
falsified
some
government
documents
and
he
got
12
years
imprisonment
and
loss
of
his
civil
rights.
this
court
at
that
time
1910
said
that
that
one
of
the
standards
is
the
disproportionate,
disproportionality
of
the
offense
with
the
punished.
now,
looking
directly
at
alabama,
alabama
--
the
crime
of
unpremeditated
murder
with
malice
in
alabama,
the
maximum
punishment
is
life
imprisonment
yet
for
larceny,
and
a
simple
assault,
you
can
get
the
death
penalty.
i
respectfully
submit
that
that
this
standard
of
disproportionality
is
applicable
to
edward
boykin.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
yes,
sir.
robbery,
common
law
robbery
as
it
is.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
well,
the
other
states
have
a
statutory
form
of
robbery
classifying
it
in
aggravation
such
as
armed
robbery.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
well,
it
adds
the
description
of
aggravation.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
well,
in
a
statutorily
--
in
an
armed
robbery
statute
he
has
to
be
armed
or
he
has
to
kill
somebody
or
whatever
classification
or
qualification
these
statutes
give
it.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
no,
sir.
in
common
law
robbery
you
can
have
conceivably
a
school
boy
in
a
corridor,
in
a
high
school
in
alabama
can
snatch
a
book
away
from
another
student
and
under
the
statute
in
alabama
he
can
get
death.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
no,
sir.
i
never
have
nor
have
i
ever
heard
of
really
in
terms
of
thinking
that
a
feller
who
didn't
kill
anybody
wouldn't
get
death,
wouldn't
sacrifice
his
own
life
for
it.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
no,
sir.
i'm
saying
that
it
is
shocking
to
think
even
under
the
judeo-christian
concepts
that
we
work
on
that
a
life
must
be
taken
when
no
life
was
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
--
was
taken.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
well
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
well
your
honor,
i
am
not
up
here
saying
that
robbery
is
not
a
serious
crime.
it
is
most
serious
but
we
got
to
recognize
that
life
is
a
fundamental
thing,
life
is
a
fundamental
right
too.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
each
life.
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
yes,
sir.
they
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
most
dear.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
witherspoon.
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
that
--
that
maybe
so
but
the
record
here
doesn't
disclose,
i
mean
i
know
or
i
can
--
it's
conjecture,
i
don't
want
to
go
outside
the
record
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
--
but
the
practice
is,
to
qualify
them
as
--
have
they
been
doing
for
a
long
time.
and
that
is
if
you've
got
--
i
think
--
i
think
if
it
appeared
in
the
record,
you
would
have
a
contravention
with
the
witherspoon
case.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
there
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
oh,
the
--
they
hold
that
it's
a
challenge
for
cause
if
a
perspective
juror
has
any
hesitancy
in
giving
the
death
penalty.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
a
taking
with
violence
or
with
the
threat
of
violence.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
yes,
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
that's
correct
sir.
a
--
aside
from
what
this
court
may
think
of
murder,
say,
as
justifying
the
death
penalty,
the
question
before
the
court
as
i
see
it
and
the
issue
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
the
death
penalty
for
robbery
is
cruel
and
unusual,
is
disproportionate,
it
--
it
comes
in
a
time
when
no
other
state
except
alabama
applies
and
it
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
is
bad
on
its
face
because
of
the
expanse
and
range
to
which
it
can
be
applied.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
reserve
whatever
time
i
have
left
for
rebuttal.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
thank
you.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
just
a
couple
of
comments
in
rebuttal.
one
is
with
regard
to
the
post-conviction
remedy
that
the
attorney
general
suggests
that
edward
boykin
might
follow.
i
--
when
i
get
back
to
mobile,
i
might
be
able
to
think
of
ten
or
eleven
more,
but
i
can
think
of
three
right
now.
one
is
that
he
might
be
dead
before
somebody
gets
interested
in
filing
a
post-conviction
remedy.
the
second
is
that
in
a
post
--
in
a
post-conviction
remedy
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
sir,
it
has
been
stayed
by
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
pending
the
hearing
in
this
court.
secondly,
he
has
no
right
of
attorney.
the
attorney
general
indicates
that
he
has
it
as
a
matter
of
right
and
yet
here's
an
excerpt
from
the
code
of
alabama
and
the
first
case
annotated
under
this
section
of
appointment
of
counsel
for
a
coram
nobis
hearing
is
that
the
trial
judge
in
his
discretion
can
determine
whether
he
gets
appointed
counsel
or
not.
and
the
third
ground
that
post-conviction
remedy
is
not
satisfactory
is
that
in
a
post-conviction
remedy,
the
petitioner
has
the
burden
of
proof.
he
has
already
sacrificed
his
cloak
of
innocence.
he's
already
sacrificed
the
court's
scrutiny
of
his
fundamental
rights
because
in
a
post-conviction
remedy
hearing,
he
has
to
prove
and
i
submit
that
this
court
holding
that
in
a
trial
in
a
capital
case
if
the
record
must
affirmatively
disclose,
then
think
of
the
burdens
that
post-conviction
remedies
would
solve.
it'd
take
a
lot
of
burden
off
of
courts
to
jut
ask
for
--
just
to
apply
this
simple
rule.
edward
boykin
wouldn't
need
a
post-conviction
remedy
if
the
record
affirmatively
showed
--
now,
there's
another
point
if
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
--
if
i
may
just
say
it
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
there
is
no
automatic
clemency
hearing
that
i
know
of
in
alabama.
if
he
has
an
attorney,
he
can
ask
for
it
but
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
says
he
has
it
as
a
matter
of
right.
thank
you.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
yes,
sir.
and
the
--
your
honor
that's
two
--
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
i've
submitted
two
briefs.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
i
--
i
submitted
two
briefs.
mr.
e.
graham
gibbons
here?
