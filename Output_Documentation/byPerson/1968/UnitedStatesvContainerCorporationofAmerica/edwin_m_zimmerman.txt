mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
on
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
to
the
middle
district
of
north
carolina.
in
1963,
the
united
states
filed
a
civil
complaint
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
alleging
that
at
least
since
1955,
the
defendant
companies
engaged
in
the
business
of
selling
corrugated
containers
in
the
southeastern
united
states
unlawfully
combined
to
exchange
among
themselves
information
as
to
prices
they
charge
are
quoted
“specific
customers,”
for
the
purpose
and
with
the
effect
of
restricting
price
competition.
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
district
court
for
decision
on
the
basis
of
proposed
findings,
many
of
which
were
agreed
to
as
well
as
on
the
basis
of
extensive
depositions
taken
by
the
plaintiff
of
various
offices
of
the
defendant,
and
of
exhibits
introduced
by
both
parties.
the
united
states
asserted
the
evidence
as
to
defendants
course
of
conduct
over
the
eight
year
period,
compelled
the
conclusion
that
a
combination
existed
whereby
defendants
finished
to
one
another
upon
request
information
as
to
the
most
recent
prize
or
current
quotes,
any
member
of
the
group
was
offering
to
a
specific
customer.
the
united
states
also
asserted
that
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
such
combination
was
unlawful
because
it
had
the
purpose
and
necessary
effect
of
restricting
prize
competition.
the
district
court
handed
down
its
decision
on
august
31,
1967.
it
dismissed
the
government's
complaint
with
prejudice
and
we
accordingly
appealed
to
this
court.
in
brief,
the
district
court
concluded
that
no
combination
for
the
furnishing
of
specific
prize
information
was
proven.
it
further
found
that
even
where
there
such
a
combination,
it
was
not
unlawful
since
there
was
no
further
agreement
among
the
defendants
to
use
the
exchange
price
information
to
maintain
prices
or
minimize
price
reductions.
we
believe
the
district
court
was
wrong
as
a
matter
of
law
and
not
finding
that
a
combination
existed
and
that
it
also
applied
an
erroneous
legal
standard
to
the
question
of
legality
of
the
combination.
they
agreed
upon
facts
described
this
market,
the
corrugated
container
industry
in
the
southeastern
part
of
the
united
states
does
over
$100
million
worth
of
business
each
year.
there
are
some
10,000
purchasers
of
corrugated
containers
in
this
region.
the
group
of
18
defendants
in
this
case
account
for
90%
of
the
shipments.
as
defendant's
brief
points
out,
the
four
largest
defendants
account
for
45%
of
the
business.
it
is
also
the
fact
that
the
six
largest
defendants
account
for
almost
60%
of
the
business.
the
number
of
sellers
interested
in
any
given
purchase
was
also
limited
by
such
considerations
as
the
geographic
proximity
of
the
buyer
to
the
seller's
plant,
the
suitability
of
the
seller's
equipment,
the
attractiveness
of
the
order
and
the
particular
product
mixed
than
being
manufactured.
the
business
is
essentially
accustomed
order
one
with
each
purchaser
indicating
the
particular
specifications
of
its
box
requirements.
the
buyers
do
not
carry
inventories
and
they
must
buy
for
immediate
needs.
price
is
the
consideration
which
determines
to
whom
a
buyer
gives
its
business.
since,
there
were
no
quality
differences
among
the
products
offered
by
the
sellers,
a
box
made
to
particular
specification
is
identical
to
any
other
seller's
box.
the
industry
throughout
the
period
was
characterized
by
chronic
overcapacity.
the
court
found
that
as
to
each
defendant,
that
when
it
considered
it
necessary
to
ascertain
from
a
defendant
competitor,
the
most
recent
price
to
a
specific
customer
or
when
to
ascertain
the
accuracy
of
a
customer's
report
of
another
competitor's
price,
that
information
was
usually
requested
from
the
competitor
then
supplying
the
customer.
the
court
also
found
as
to
each
defendant,
that
when
such
a
request
for
information
as
to
the
most
recent
price
to
a
specific
customer
was
received,
that
information
usually
was
furnished
and
it
was
accurate.
after
receipt
of
the
information,
each
company
was
free
to
do
with
it,
what
it
wished.
although
the
findings
again
show,
and
is
say
it
finding
28th,
that
“in
the
majority
of
instances,
the
recipient
quoted
or
charged
substantially
the
same
price
as
the
price
given
by
it's
competitor
in
response
to
its
request.”
this
interchange
was
engaged
in
throughout
the
eight
year
period
except
when
for
brief
periods
for
defendants
went
as
one
witness
put
it
off
the
air.
in
such
cases,
the
defendants
would
neither
give
nor
request
the
price
information.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
no,
it
does
not
mr.
justice
harlan,
and
i
think
this
would
enable
me
to
clarify
what
this
case
is
not
about
because
it's
not
about
that.
for
one
thing,
this
case
is
not
about
an
express
agreement,
it's
about
a
combination
which
is
revealed
by
a
persistent
course
of
conduct.
secondly,
it's
not
about
the
claim
of
specific
price
fixing,
as
for
example,
the
government
charged
in
the
electrical
price
conspiracy
cases
where
in
submitting
bids
on
custom-made
equipment
as
here,
manufactures
were
accused
as
of
conspiring
as
to
who
would
bid,
what
price,
it's
not
about
that.
we
are
claiming
a
combination
that
meliorates
that
bigger
of
price
competition,
that
inhibits
it,
that
breaks
it.
to
express
the
distinction
as
to
the
conduct,
it
was
as
though
the
electrical
equipment
manufacturers
in
submitting
competing
bids
to
public
utilities
on
a
custom-made
machine
agreed
among
themselves
in
order
to
alleviate
the
perils
of
inadvertent
price
cuts,
that
anytime
a
perspective
seller
on
a
piece
of
business
was
uncertain
as
to
what
a
competitor
was
bidding,
that
information
would
usually
be
accurately
supplied
by
the
competitor
upon
request
and
the
favor
would
be
returned
at
some
future
point.
this
is
not
a
case
that
seeks
to
outlaw
the
availability
of
price
information.
the
trade
association
and
this
case
supplied
its
members
with
monthly
price
configures
and
would
weekly
analyze
price
trend
information
computed
for
each
defendant
and
that
is
not
challenged
by
the
government.
published
pricing
manuals
existed
and
those
are
not
challenged
by
the
government.
the
defendants
had
available
to
them
their
own
cost
information,
and
the
wrong
record
of
prior
pricing
and
as
the
findings
indicated,
prior
pricing
to
a
customer
tended
to
be
carried
forward,
unless
there
were
significant
cost
changes
or
unless
market
conditions
altered
and
purchasers
could
reveal
to
competing
bidders
if
they
thought
it
improved
competition
the
bids
they
had
received.
hence,
this
is
a
not
a
case
that
challenges
as
illegal,
any
acquisition
of
information
needed
for
intelligent
marketing
initiative
decisions.
it's
a
case
which
claims
the
defendants
have
through
the
combination
become
too
precise,
too
detailed,
too
knowledgeable
about
the
specific
plans
of
each
other,
and
it's
this
precision
that
inhibits
price
competition
a
conclusion
verified
in
this
case
by
uncontroverted
deposition
evidence,
that
the
parties
to
the
information
exchange
regarded
it
as
assurance
against
unnecessary
price
cuts.
finally,
mr.
justice
harlan,
we
do
not
claim
that
the
agreement
froze
prices.
this
industry
according
to
the
findings
has
throughout
the
period
in
question
been
characterized
by
overcapacity.
a
condition
which
ordinarily
makes
for
a
vigorous
price
competition
that
works
to
adjust
the
capacity
to
demand.
the
fact
that
under
the
circumstances,
prices
varied
and
business
shifted
is
not
as
significant
as
the
uncontroverted
fact
that
despite
the
chronic
overcapacity,
new
entrance
were
attracted
to
the
market,
an
indication
that
market
competition
was
not
doing
its
job
of
balancing
capacity
and
demand.
my
task
is
to
persuade
you
that
the
course
of
conduct
over
the
eight-year
period,
evidence
is
a
combination
and
that
this
combination
is
illegal.
because
i
do
not
read
defendant's
brief
as
showing
much
heart
for
the
proposition
that
a
combination
did
not
exist.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes,
the
fact
that
there
was
extensive
new
entry
despite
the
fact
of
chronic
overcapacity
indicates
that
something
is
wrong
in
the
pricing.
if
you
had
competitive
pricing,
typically
overcapacity
would
lead
to
depression
of
profit
and
less
attractiveness
for
new
entrance
into
the
business
and
our
judgment
to
the
fact
that
you
have
no
entry
despite
the
chronic
overcapacity
suggest
that
something
isn't
working.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
oh,
competition
mr.
justice
harlan
is
intended
to
allocate
resources
most
properly.
it's
intended
to
have
people
make
informed
decisions
about
when
to
leave
the
industry
and
when
to
build
new
capacity.
that's
why
we
are
committed
to
it,
and
the
fact
that
you
get
the
distortion
here,
i
suggest
the
competition
has
not
been
working.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
mr.
justice
fortas
as
you
and
i
are
at
the
same
point
in
my
argument,
the
district
court
stated
that
if
a
combination
existed,
it
was
not
unlawful.
it
appear
to
thank
that
the
critical
question
was,
whether
the
defendants
had
a
further
understanding
to
use
the
exchange
price
information
to
inhibit
competition.
the
court
found
that
each
party
made
an
individual
decision
as
to
pricing
after
receiving
the
information
and
decided
that
no
further
agreement
could
be
inferred.
that
therefore
refuse
to
consider
the
significance
of
uncontroverted
evidence,
which
the
court
itself
described
as
showing
that
most
defendants
felt
that
the
price
information
was
needed
to
maintain
prices
and
minimize
price
competition
that
might
otherwise
exist.
and
here
is
my
point
mr.
justice
fortas,
as
we
did
not
clam
that
in
addition
to
the
information
exchange,
you
needed
a
further
agreement
on
how
to
use
the
information.
the
proposition
we
advanced
to
the
court,
is
that
when
a
group
of
sellers
who
account
for
by
far
the
dominant
share
of
the
market
combined
to
meet
or
call
one
another
when
there
was
a
substantial
doubt
as
to
what
some
member
of
the
group
may
be
bidding
on
a
particular
piece
of
business,
and
when
they
were
motivated
to
such
a
combination
by
their
concern,
that
failure
to
have
such
complete
and
precise
information
could
lead
to
price
cutting.
even
though
each
party
walks
away
from
the
meeting
with
the
nominal
freedom,
the
charge
as
he
pleases
the
necessary
effect
of
allaying
the
doubts
and
resolving
the
uncertainties
in
this
context
is
to
mitigate
price
competition.
of
course,
if
they
had
the
further
agreement
as
to
specific
prices,
the
arrangement
would
be
blatantly
and
criminally
unlawful.
but
under
the
circumstances
of
further
agreement
it's
not
necessary
unless
this
be
regarded
as
noble
doctrine,
i
refer
you
to
this
court's
decision
and
american
column,
257
u.s.,
now
399,
the
court
again
in
an
information
exchange
agreement
noted
that
there
was
the
absence
of
a
further
agreement
as
to
pricing.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
there
was
occasional
meetings,
most
of
the
exchanges
where
by
telephone,
or
by
oral
content.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
there
were
occasional
meetings,
but
most
of
the
--
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
they
meet
or
whether
they
meet
on
the
telephone.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
right,
there
was
communication.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
we're
talking
about
a
course
of
conduct
here
and
in
terms
of
the
exchange
of
information,
this
is
simply
a
course
of
conduct
in
terms
of
the
telephone
calls
and
the
occasional
meetings
which
i
suppose
happened
after
trade
association
meetings
ended.
this
was
a
course
of
conduct
that
typify
this
industry
over
the
eight
year
period
covered
by
the
compliant
and
apparently,
it
preceded
the
complaint.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
in
the
telephone,
yeah.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
no.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
it's
more
complicated
than
that.
a
competitor
would
ask
the
other
competitor,
what
is
your
price
to
x
whom
you
are
now
supplying?
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
no.
it
includes
your
--
there
are
two
types
of
price
information
generally
that
was
supplied.
the
last
quoted
price
and/or
a
current
quote,
it
varied
from
competitor
to
competitor,
but
the
point
is
that
the
information
requested
was
readily
understood
as
indicating
the
current
price.
certainly,
a
current
quote
indicates
the
current
price.
the
last
sale
quote
in
this
industry
is
a
very
good
indication
of
a
current
price
because
of
the
finding
that
there
was
a
persistency
of
prior
prices.
if
the
company
had
been
supplying
a
customer
at
a
given
price,
it
typically
barring
certain
changes
in
the
industry
would
requote
that
price.
so,
that
this
information
when
exchanged
was
meaningful
to
the
parties
asking
it.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
well,
yes.
the
1940
consent
decree
was
not
a
permissive
decree,
but
the
1940
consent
decree
spoke
of
past
prices
and
in
this
respect,
i
think
it
went
beyond
the
section
3
of
the
1940
consent
decree.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
eight
--
i
believe
eight
defendants
that
gave
only
their
most
recent
price
rather
than
the
current
quote.
but,
as
i
indicate
that
most
recent
price
is
readily
translatable
and
of
course
that
decree
didn't
permit,
it
simply
indicated
its
limitations.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
as
the
court
below
points
out,
the
consent
decree
does
not
repeal
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
section
3
simply
indicates
what
the
limitations
of
that
decree
were.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
well,
it
was
limited
to
--
designed
to
limit
the
trade
association
here,
to
the
activities
permitted
by
maple
flooring,
indeed
that's
what
they
did.
they
exchanged
all
the
information
that
maple
flooring
permitted
them
to
a
association
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
exchange
of
information
has
to
pass
in
close
transactions.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
it's
for
the
right
information.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
in
this
case,
some
defendants
we
have
explicit
evidence
that
they
gave
current
quotes
that
they
now
have
to
a
purchaser.
and
the
case
of
the
past,
the
close
quotes,
the
practice
in
this
industry
was
such
that
this
could
be
readily
assumed
to
give
a
very
good
indication
of
what
the
next
quote
would
be.
now,
i
think
that
the
court
below
failed
to
look
at
the
uncontroverted
deposition
evidence
because
it
misconceives
the
teachings
of
the
prior
cases.
but,
the
prior
cases
don't
say
that
you
need
an
additional
agreement,
prior
cases
say
that
the
additional
agreement
can
be
the
missing
link
“american
column”
the
missing
link,
the
absence
of
the
agreement
on
how
to
use
a
price
is
supplied
by
the
disposition
of
man
to
follow
their
most
intelligent
competitors.
they
hear
an
disposition
to
make
all
the
money
possible
and
by
the
system
of
reports
which
makes
discovery
of
price
reductions
inevitable
and
immediate,
to
illustrate
what
the
uncontroverted
deposition
evidenced
indicated,
i'd
like
to
refer
you
to
page
32
of
our
brief
where
we
have
the
following
colloquy.
question:
were
you
ever
requested
for
information
by
the
same
competitors?
answer:
yes
sir.
question:
what
would
you
do
on
these
occasions?
answer:
we
would
give
them
the
information,
mr.
bernstein.
if
i'm
selling
a
box
for
a
dollar
and
i
don't
give
you
the
information,
you
got
to
guess
at
my
price,
and
i
don't
want
you
guessing
68
cents
of
my
dollar
price.
if
you
are
going
to
cut
it,
i
would
rather
you
cut
a
penny
to
99,
don't
make
me
look
like
an
idiot,
that's
why
dixie
container
gives
prices.
other
officials
testify
the
exchange
of
information
presented
--
prevented
destructive
price
competition,
avoided
the
necessity
of
pricing
as
low
as
he
was
willing
to
go.
the
district
court
erroneously
because
it
insisted
on
a
further
agreement
ignored
this
evidence.
but,
even
if
we
didn't
have
this
evidence,
we
think
that
the
necessary
effect
here
where
you
have
information
requested
at
times
of
uncertainty
by
members
of
irrelatively
small
group
of
sellers,
six
of
whom
did
almost
60%
of
the
business.
under
circumstances,
where
self
interest
would
dictate
minimization
of
the
rigors
of
price
competition
and
where
the
buyers
demand
was
fixed.
we
think
that
under
such
a
situation,
so
long
as
pricing
was
clearly
visible
to
one
another,
so
long
as
any
uncertainty
was
avoided,
it
would
not
pay
anyone
substantially
to
cut
prices
since
the
others
could
know
of
match
the
cut,
and
the
share
of
the
business
would
have
to
remain
the
same
at
a
lower
profit.
the
individual
self
interest
of
each
participant
could
be
relied
upon
to
mitigate
competition.
once
the
combination
to
exchange
information
was
in
effect
unpredictably
and
this
is
very
important,
the
evidence
showed
in
the
court
found
that
in
the
majority
of
instances,
the
recipient
of
the
information
in
fact
quoted
substantially
the
same
price
it
had
received.
the
district
court
discusses
the
fact
that
the
information
exchange
was
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
informed
marketing
decisions.
but,
the
court
treats
informed
decision
making
with
an
undiscriminating
reverence
and
linseed
oil
and
american
column
revealed
the
dangers
of
over
specificity
on
current
prices.
the
point
is
that
but
for
the
information
exchange,
occasions
would
have
a
reason
when
the
defendants
would
have
been
slightly
in
the
dark
as
to
how
low
they
would
have
to
bid.
these
are
the
occasions
when
the
buyers
determine
it
is
not
in
their
self
interest
to
educate
the
bidders
as
to
the
precise
state
of
the
competition.
on
those
occasions,
but
for
the
combination,
the
competitors
would
have
consulted
their
own
cost
and
the
extensive
general
price
information
available
to
them
and
submitted
a
price
that
warranted
them
a
profit.
defendants
argue
that
without
the
information
they
may
have
bid
to
high.
but,
they
had
a
good
idea
of
the
level
of
prices
and
if
they
bid
to
high
the
buyer
would
probably
tell
them
and
in
fact
the
court
found
that
many
buyers
gave
high
bidders
a
second
chance
to
meet
the
lower
price.
it's
not
in
the
buyer's
interest
by
being
silent
to
induce
high
price.
he's
interested
in
doing
and
inducing
low
prices,
indeed
if
it
want
a
specific
information,
the
serious
risk
existed
that
the
uninformed
seller
would
bid
too
high
one
wonders
why
each
competitor
assisted
his
colleague
to
avoid
such
a
mistake.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
very
simply
mr.
justice
fortas,
they
could
and
did
exchange
through
their
trade
association.
information
as
to
past
pricing
behavior
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
at
the
--
every
ten
days,
they
would
compute
what
the
prices
had
been
previously.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
average
prices
with
some
breakdown
according
to

some
breakdown
according
to
type
of
box.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes,
i
distinguish
between
that
and
prices
to
individual
customer.
secondly,
they
could
receive
from
the
buyers
information
as
to
what
the
competitors
were
selling
if
the
buyer
wanted
to
give
it
to
him.
we
have
no
objection
to
that.
thirdly,
they
could
publish
to
the
world
their
price
lists.
we
have
no
objection
to
that
because
price
list
are
general
and
people
can
discount
from
price
list
in
specific
cases.
it's
when
they
crawl
up
to
one
another
and
agree
upon
the
exchange
of
information
as
to
the
specific
price,
to
the
specific
customer.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
well,
yes!
we're
charging
a
combination
to
exchange
information,
an
agreement
to
exchange
information.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
well,
one
can
deduce
an
agreement
or
a
combination
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
we
are
charging
a
combination,
language
of
the
compliant
is
a
combination
with
--
by

to

prices.
that's
the
language
of
the
--
or
understanding.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
and
were
current.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
right.
current
either
because
they
were
current
quotes
or
current
because
they
were
last
sale
transactions
which
in
the
context
of
this
particular
industry
was
a
very
good
indication
of
what
the
seller
who
gave
that
information
would
next
charge.
now,
we
argue
that
the
buyer
would
not
ordinarily
act
against
the
self
interest
and
by
remaining
silent
co-sellers
to
bid
too
high,
and
we
think
that
as
this
court
has
recognized
extensive
and
specific
information
on
current
prices
available
to
a
relatively
small
group
of
sellers
buying
for
the
same
market,
will
resolve
in
mitigation
of
competition.
the
agreement
here,
the
combination
of
the
understanding
evidence
by
the
course
of
conduct
over
eight
years
and
before
can
be
understood
by
a
sellers
desire
to
avoid
the
possibility
that
his
opponent
had
kept
in
the
dark,
may
comment
at
a
lower
price
and
again,
i
note
the
explicit
testimony
which
reveal
this,
which
i
referred
to
earlier,
and
the
court's
finding
that
in
most
cases
in
fact,
upon
receiving
information,
the
recipient
quoted
the
same
price
as
the
price
furnished.
i'd
like
to
turn
for
a
moment
to
the
question
whether
there
was
a
combination.
the
court
below
seem
to
think
that
this
could
be
regarded
as
unilateral
conduct
as
in
theater
enterprises,
but
we're
not
dealing
with
unilateral
conduct
such
as
refusal
to
deal.
there
were
two
parties
to
each
request
and
each
answer.
furthermore,
the
district
court
itself
referred
to
an
implied
understanding
that
by
giving
the
information,
one
gets
the
right
to
request
the
information
and
indeed
i
read
appellee's
brief
of
page
13
to
concede
that.
hence,
the
conduct
is
not
only
bilateral
joint,
it's
interdependent.
one
simply
doesn't
do
it
without
reliance
in
what
the
others
are
doing.
this
is
evidence
by
the
fact
that
when
a
company
went
off
the
air,
it
went
off
the
air
both
ways.
it
didn't
continue
furnishing
information,
it
not
had
furnished
nor
requested
information.
the
district
court
was
also
mislead
by
the
fact
of
request
varied
in
frequency
that
information
was
supplied
in
different
forms
and
that
the
defendants
retain
the
freedom
to
stop
furnishing
information.
the
variations
and
frequency
merely
met
that
the
agreement
worked
when
it
had
to,
namely
in
those
occasions
where
there
was
uncertainty.
where
the
buyer
wasn't
talking
or
wasn't
being
accurate.
the
different
forms
of
the
information
as
i
try
to
explain
to
you
mr.
justice
fortas
did
not
make
very
much
difference
because
with
the
manuals
that
existed
here
and
with
the
practices
of
the
trade,
the
information
was
readily
translatable
and
we
can't
assume
that
the
parties
here
were
engaged
in
a
useless
exchange
of
stale
information.
finally,
the
fact
that
each
company
maintain
its
freedom
to
furnish
information
is
another
way
of
stating
that
it
pertain
that
the
right
to
depart
and
go
off
the
air.
the
fact
that
they
usually
furnish
information,
rather
than
always
furnish
information
does
not
mean
that
there
was
not
a
course
of
conduct
here,
such
usual
conduct
over
an
eight
year
period
is
evidenced
enough
of
a
combination
even
the
most
explicitly
conceived
conspiracy
does
not
operate
to
perfection.
thank
you.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
were
not
relying
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
no,
i
was
saying
that
it
confirms
--
we're
arguing
that
the
necessary
effect
here
is
to

right.

edwin
m.
zimmerman
to

to
be
expected
when
you
have
overcapacity,
but
the
point
is
that
the
adjustment
isn't
being
made
properly.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
you
establish
a
restraint
of
trade
in
this
type
of
case
when
you
assume
that
the
necessary
effect
--
look,
the
purpose
of
this
if
you
accept
the
government's
view,
was
to
avoid
unnecessary
price
cutting.
inadvertent
price
cutting
due
to
ignorance
of
what
the
buyer
is
getting.
they
therefore
enter
the
combination,
if
you
accept
our
view.
the
combination
provides
the
precise
information
which
avoids
that
uncertainty.
we
argue
under
those
circumstances,
the
necessary
effect
is
to
ameliorate,
not
to
end
price
competition.
there
are
many
cases
here
in
which
the
buyer
would
reveal
the
price
and
there
would
be
competition.
there
was
ample
price
information
to
the
parties,
so
that
the
economic
forces
that
worked
would
be
working,
but
the
point
is,
it
was
not
working
as
it
should
have
and
this
is
evidenced,
we
think
though,
i'm
not
relying
on
it,
by
the
fact
that
you
have
chronic
overcapacity
and
entry.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
because
you're
deprived
by
having
the
sellers
agree
with
another
that
they
will
get
the
price
if
the
buyer
doesn't
--
deprive
the
buyer
in
a
situation
where
he
probably
needs
it
of
a
bargaining
to
namely
silence.
that's
the
difference.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
i'm
--
again,
i
have
to
give
the
same
answer
that
mr.
seymour
gave
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
know.
the
only
information
that
i
have
is
that
the
president
of
the
dixie
company
testified
that
he
exchanged
information
only
with
people
that
he
could
trust.
some
suggestion
that
the
exchange
may
not
have
included
everyone
in
the
industry
but
beyond
that
i
cannot
say
and
i
don't
think
the
record
were
disclosed.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
well,
we
picked
out
all
the
substantial
companies,
there
were
a
number
of
new
entrance,
i
don't
know
how
many
of
the
other
companies
would
have
been
relatively
new
entrants
and
i
assume
that
we
chose
those
on
as
to
whom
we
had
evidence.
the
grand
jury
which
began
this
was
inspired
by
a
complaint
of
a
costumer
and
i
suppose
we
tract
the
grand
jury
to
see
who
was
involved
in
this.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
no,
i
think
the
rule
we
are
advancing
here
mr.
justice
fortas
is
that
when
you
have
an
industry
which
is
dominated
by
a
relatively,
relatively
small
number
of
sellers,
then
the
precise
exchange
of
current
price
information
with
respect
to
particular
costumers
necessarily
as
an
inhibiting
effect
on
pricing
because
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
of
the
ability
of
that
small
group
to
visualize
the
necessary
consequence.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
as
to
effect.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
as
to
effect.
now,
in
this
case,
we
have
explicit
proof
that
this
was
their
purpose
but
the
court
ignored
it
because
it
seem
to
think
we
had
to
prove
a
subsequent
agreement
and
we
don't,
an
american
column
makes
it
clear
that
we
don't.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
well,
yes
we
have
specific
findings
which
indicate
that
when
the
information
was
supplied,
the
recipient
quoted
the
same
price,
we
have
that
but
we
did
not
even
attempt
to
go
into
the
question
of
what
was
happening
to
prices
that
it
seem
to
us
is
not
necessary
after
the
socony-vacuum
case.

case
in
which
the
court
found
illegally
exchange
of
information
with
365
sellers
representing
but
33%
of
the
industry.
maple

was
a
case
in
which
the
information
exchange
was
only
as
to
past
transactions
without
identity
of
particular
costumers,
neither
of
which
--
mr.

i
think
there
were
about

mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
i
believe
so.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
i
think
they
had
most
of
the
business
but
there
was
no
exchange
of
current
or
specific
price
information
and
the
maple
flooring
exchange
indeed
went
on
here
and
we
didn't
challenge
it,
that's
what
the

association
was
doing.
mr.

m.

yes.
mr.

oh,
we
do
not
claim
any
evidence
that
the
price
went
up.
we
are
not
--
we
are
not
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
i
stated
that
the
purpose
of
the
exchange
as
to
explicit
information
was
to
avoid
unnecessary
in
terms
price
cutting.
that
in
order
to
eliminate
doubt
as
to
what
the
price
was
so
that
there
wouldn't
be
price
cutting.
they
exchanged
specific
information
as
to
prices
a
seller
was
quoting
to
a
specific
costumer
and
this
was
the
arrangement
and
this
was
the
combination.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
on
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
to
the
middle
district
of
north
carolina.
in
1963,
the
united
states
filed
a
civil
complaint
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
alleging
that
at
least
since
1955,
the
defendant
companies
engaged
in
the
business
of
selling
corrugated
containers
in
the
southeastern
united
states
unlawfully
combined
to
exchange
among
themselves
information
as
to
prices
they
charge
are
quoted
“specific
customers,”
for
the
purpose
and
with
the
effect
of
restricting
price
competition.
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
district
court
for
decision
on
the
basis
of
proposed
findings,
many
of
which
were
agreed
to
as
well
as
on
the
basis
of
extensive
depositions
taken
by
the
plaintiff
of
various
offices
of
the
defendant,
and
of
exhibits
introduced
by
both
parties.
the
united
states
asserted
the
evidence
as
to
defendants
course
of
conduct
over
the
eight
year
period,
compelled
the
conclusion
that
a
combination
existed
whereby
defendants
finished
to
one
another
upon
request
information
as
to
the
most
recent
prize
or
current
quotes,
any
member
of
the
group
was
offering
to
a
specific
customer.
the
united
states
also
asserted
that
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
such
combination
was
unlawful
because
it
had
the
purpose
and
necessary
effect
of
restricting
prize
competition.
the
district
court
handed
down
its
decision
on
august
31,
1967.
it
dismissed
the
government's
complaint
with
prejudice
and
we
accordingly
appealed
to
this
court.
in
brief,
the
district
court
concluded
that
no
combination
for
the
furnishing
of
specific
prize
information
was
proven.
it
further
found
that
even
where
there
such
a
combination,
it
was
not
unlawful
since
there
was
no
further
agreement
among
the
defendants
to
use
the
exchange
price
information
to
maintain
prices
or
minimize
price
reductions.
we
believe
the
district
court
was
wrong
as
a
matter
of
law
and
not
finding
that
a
combination
existed
and
that
it
also
applied
an
erroneous
legal
standard
to
the
question
of
legality
of
the
combination.
they
agreed
upon
facts
described
this
market,
the
corrugated
container
industry
in
the
southeastern
part
of
the
united
states
does
over
$100
million
worth
of
business
each
year.
there
are
some
10,000
purchasers
of
corrugated
containers
in
this
region.
the
group
of
18
defendants
in
this
case
account
for
90%
of
the
shipments.
as
defendant's
brief
points
out,
the
four
largest
defendants
account
for
45%
of
the
business.
it
is
also
the
fact
that
the
six
largest
defendants
account
for
almost
60%
of
the
business.
the
number
of
sellers
interested
in
any
given
purchase
was
also
limited
by
such
considerations
as
the
geographic
proximity
of
the
buyer
to
the
seller's
plant,
the
suitability
of
the
seller's
equipment,
the
attractiveness
of
the
order
and
the
particular
product
mixed
than
being
manufactured.
the
business
is
essentially
accustomed
order
one
with
each
purchaser
indicating
the
particular
specifications
of
its
box
requirements.
the
buyers
do
not
carry
inventories
and
they
must
buy
for
immediate
needs.
price
is
the
consideration
which
determines
to
whom
a
buyer
gives
its
business.
since,
there
were
no
quality
differences
among
the
products
offered
by
the
sellers,
a
box
made
to
particular
specification
is
identical
to
any
other
seller's
box.
the
industry
throughout
the
period
was
characterized
by
chronic
overcapacity.
the
court
found
that
as
to
each
defendant,
that
when
it
considered
it
necessary
to
ascertain
from
a
defendant
competitor,
the
most
recent
price
to
a
specific
customer
or
when
to
ascertain
the
accuracy
of
a
customer's
report
of
another
competitor's
price,
that
information
was
usually
requested
from
the
competitor
then
supplying
the
customer.
the
court
also
found
as
to
each
defendant,
that
when
such
a
request
for
information
as
to
the
most
recent
price
to
a
specific
customer
was
received,
that
information
usually
was
furnished
and
it
was
accurate.
after
receipt
of
the
information,
each
company
was
free
to
do
with
it,
what
it
wished.
although
the
findings
again
show,
and
is
say
it
finding
28th,
that
“in
the
majority
of
instances,
the
recipient
quoted
or
charged
substantially
the
same
price
as
the
price
given
by
it's
competitor
in
response
to
its
request.”
this
interchange
was
engaged
in
throughout
the
eight
year
period
except
when
for
brief
periods
for
defendants
went
as
one
witness
put
it
off
the
air.
in
such
cases,
the
defendants
would
neither
give
nor
request
the
price
information.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
no,
it
does
not
mr.
justice
harlan,
and
i
think
this
would
enable
me
to
clarify
what
this
case
is
not
about
because
it's
not
about
that.
for
one
thing,
this
case
is
not
about
an
express
agreement,
it's
about
a
combination
which
is
revealed
by
a
persistent
course
of
conduct.
secondly,
it's
not
about
the
claim
of
specific
price
fixing,
as
for
example,
the
government
charged
in
the
electrical
price
conspiracy
cases
where
in
submitting
bids
on
custom-made
equipment
as
here,
manufactures
were
accused
as
of
conspiring
as
to
who
would
bid,
what
price,
it's
not
about
that.
we
are
claiming
a
combination
that
meliorates
that
bigger
of
price
competition,
that
inhibits
it,
that
breaks
it.
to
express
the
distinction
as
to
the
conduct,
it
was
as
though
the
electrical
equipment
manufacturers
in
submitting
competing
bids
to
public
utilities
on
a
custom-made
machine
agreed
among
themselves
in
order
to
alleviate
the
perils
of
inadvertent
price
cuts,
that
anytime
a
perspective
seller
on
a
piece
of
business
was
uncertain
as
to
what
a
competitor
was
bidding,
that
information
would
usually
be
accurately
supplied
by
the
competitor
upon
request
and
the
favor
would
be
returned
at
some
future
point.
this
is
not
a
case
that
seeks
to
outlaw
the
availability
of
price
information.
the
trade
association
and
this
case
supplied
its
members
with
monthly
price
configures
and
would
weekly
analyze
price
trend
information
computed
for
each
defendant
and
that
is
not
challenged
by
the
government.
published
pricing
manuals
existed
and
those
are
not
challenged
by
the
government.
the
defendants
had
available
to
them
their
own
cost
information,
and
the
wrong
record
of
prior
pricing
and
as
the
findings
indicated,
prior
pricing
to
a
customer
tended
to
be
carried
forward,
unless
there
were
significant
cost
changes
or
unless
market
conditions
altered
and
purchasers
could
reveal
to
competing
bidders
if
they
thought
it
improved
competition
the
bids
they
had
received.
hence,
this
is
a
not
a
case
that
challenges
as
illegal,
any
acquisition
of
information
needed
for
intelligent
marketing
initiative
decisions.
it's
a
case
which
claims
the
defendants
have
through
the
combination
become
too
precise,
too
detailed,
too
knowledgeable
about
the
specific
plans
of
each
other,
and
it's
this
precision
that
inhibits
price
competition
a
conclusion
verified
in
this
case
by
uncontroverted
deposition
evidence,
that
the
parties
to
the
information
exchange
regarded
it
as
assurance
against
unnecessary
price
cuts.
finally,
mr.
justice
harlan,
we
do
not
claim
that
the
agreement
froze
prices.
this
industry
according
to
the
findings
has
throughout
the
period
in
question
been
characterized
by
overcapacity.
a
condition
which
ordinarily
makes
for
a
vigorous
price
competition
that
works
to
adjust
the
capacity
to
demand.
the
fact
that
under
the
circumstances,
prices
varied
and
business
shifted
is
not
as
significant
as
the
uncontroverted
fact
that
despite
the
chronic
overcapacity,
new
entrance
were
attracted
to
the
market,
an
indication
that
market
competition
was
not
doing
its
job
of
balancing
capacity
and
demand.
my
task
is
to
persuade
you
that
the
course
of
conduct
over
the
eight-year
period,
evidence
is
a
combination
and
that
this
combination
is
illegal.
because
i
do
not
read
defendant's
brief
as
showing
much
heart
for
the
proposition
that
a
combination
did
not
exist.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes,
the
fact
that
there
was
extensive
new
entry
despite
the
fact
of
chronic
overcapacity
indicates
that
something
is
wrong
in
the
pricing.
if
you
had
competitive
pricing,
typically
overcapacity
would
lead
to
depression
of
profit
and
less
attractiveness
for
new
entrance
into
the
business
and
our
judgment
to
the
fact
that
you
have
no
entry
despite
the
chronic
overcapacity
suggest
that
something
isn't
working.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
oh,
competition
mr.
justice
harlan
is
intended
to
allocate
resources
most
properly.
it's
intended
to
have
people
make
informed
decisions
about
when
to
leave
the
industry
and
when
to
build
new
capacity.
that's
why
we
are
committed
to
it,
and
the
fact
that
you
get
the
distortion
here,
i
suggest
the
competition
has
not
been
working.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
mr.
justice
fortas
as
you
and
i
are
at
the
same
point
in
my
argument,
the
district
court
stated
that
if
a
combination
existed,
it
was
not
unlawful.
it
appear
to
thank
that
the
critical
question
was,
whether
the
defendants
had
a
further
understanding
to
use
the
exchange
price
information
to
inhibit
competition.
the
court
found
that
each
party
made
an
individual
decision
as
to
pricing
after
receiving
the
information
and
decided
that
no
further
agreement
could
be
inferred.
that
therefore
refuse
to
consider
the
significance
of
uncontroverted
evidence,
which
the
court
itself
described
as
showing
that
most
defendants
felt
that
the
price
information
was
needed
to
maintain
prices
and
minimize
price
competition
that
might
otherwise
exist.
and
here
is
my
point
mr.
justice
fortas,
as
we
did
not
clam
that
in
addition
to
the
information
exchange,
you
needed
a
further
agreement
on
how
to
use
the
information.
the
proposition
we
advanced
to
the
court,
is
that
when
a
group
of
sellers
who
account
for
by
far
the
dominant
share
of
the
market
combined
to
meet
or
call
one
another
when
there
was
a
substantial
doubt
as
to
what
some
member
of
the
group
may
be
bidding
on
a
particular
piece
of
business,
and
when
they
were
motivated
to
such
a
combination
by
their
concern,
that
failure
to
have
such
complete
and
precise
information
could
lead
to
price
cutting.
even
though
each
party
walks
away
from
the
meeting
with
the
nominal
freedom,
the
charge
as
he
pleases
the
necessary
effect
of
allaying
the
doubts
and
resolving
the
uncertainties
in
this
context
is
to
mitigate
price
competition.
of
course,
if
they
had
the
further
agreement
as
to
specific
prices,
the
arrangement
would
be
blatantly
and
criminally
unlawful.
but
under
the
circumstances
of
further
agreement
it's
not
necessary
unless
this
be
regarded
as
noble
doctrine,
i
refer
you
to
this
court's
decision
and
american
column,
257
u.s.,
now
399,
the
court
again
in
an
information
exchange
agreement
noted
that
there
was
the
absence
of
a
further
agreement
as
to
pricing.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
there
was
occasional
meetings,
most
of
the
exchanges
where
by
telephone,
or
by
oral
content.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
there
were
occasional
meetings,
but
most
of
the
--
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
they
meet
or
whether
they
meet
on
the
telephone.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
right,
there
was
communication.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
we're
talking
about
a
course
of
conduct
here
and
in
terms
of
the
exchange
of
information,
this
is
simply
a
course
of
conduct
in
terms
of
the
telephone
calls
and
the
occasional
meetings
which
i
suppose
happened
after
trade
association
meetings
ended.
this
was
a
course
of
conduct
that
typify
this
industry
over
the
eight
year
period
covered
by
the
compliant
and
apparently,
it
preceded
the
complaint.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
in
the
telephone,
yeah.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
no.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
it's
more
complicated
than
that.
a
competitor
would
ask
the
other
competitor,
what
is
your
price
to
x
whom
you
are
now
supplying?
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
no.
it
includes
your
--
there
are
two
types
of
price
information
generally
that
was
supplied.
the
last
quoted
price
and/or
a
current
quote,
it
varied
from
competitor
to
competitor,
but
the
point
is
that
the
information
requested
was
readily
understood
as
indicating
the
current
price.
certainly,
a
current
quote
indicates
the
current
price.
the
last
sale
quote
in
this
industry
is
a
very
good
indication
of
a
current
price
because
of
the
finding
that
there
was
a
persistency
of
prior
prices.
if
the
company
had
been
supplying
a
customer
at
a
given
price,
it
typically
barring
certain
changes
in
the
industry
would
requote
that
price.
so,
that
this
information
when
exchanged
was
meaningful
to
the
parties
asking
it.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
well,
yes.
the
1940
consent
decree
was
not
a
permissive
decree,
but
the
1940
consent
decree
spoke
of
past
prices
and
in
this
respect,
i
think
it
went
beyond
the
section
3
of
the
1940
consent
decree.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
eight
--
i
believe
eight
defendants
that
gave
only
their
most
recent
price
rather
than
the
current
quote.
but,
as
i
indicate
that
most
recent
price
is
readily
translatable
and
of
course
that
decree
didn't
permit,
it
simply
indicated
its
limitations.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
as
the
court
below
points
out,
the
consent
decree
does
not
repeal
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
section
3
simply
indicates
what
the
limitations
of
that
decree
were.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
well,
it
was
limited
to
--
designed
to
limit
the
trade
association
here,
to
the
activities
permitted
by
maple
flooring,
indeed
that's
what
they
did.
they
exchanged
all
the
information
that
maple
flooring
permitted
them
to
a
association
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
exchange
of
information
has
to
pass
in
close
transactions.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
it's
for
the
right
information.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
in
this
case,
some
defendants
we
have
explicit
evidence
that
they
gave
current
quotes
that
they
now
have
to
a
purchaser.
and
the
case
of
the
past,
the
close
quotes,
the
practice
in
this
industry
was
such
that
this
could
be
readily
assumed
to
give
a
very
good
indication
of
what
the
next
quote
would
be.
now,
i
think
that
the
court
below
failed
to
look
at
the
uncontroverted
deposition
evidence
because
it
misconceives
the
teachings
of
the
prior
cases.
but,
the
prior
cases
don't
say
that
you
need
an
additional
agreement,
prior
cases
say
that
the
additional
agreement
can
be
the
missing
link
“american
column”
the
missing
link,
the
absence
of
the
agreement
on
how
to
use
a
price
is
supplied
by
the
disposition
of
man
to
follow
their
most
intelligent
competitors.
they
hear
an
disposition
to
make
all
the
money
possible
and
by
the
system
of
reports
which
makes
discovery
of
price
reductions
inevitable
and
immediate,
to
illustrate
what
the
uncontroverted
deposition
evidenced
indicated,
i'd
like
to
refer
you
to
page
32
of
our
brief
where
we
have
the
following
colloquy.
question:
were
you
ever
requested
for
information
by
the
same
competitors?
answer:
yes
sir.
question:
what
would
you
do
on
these
occasions?
answer:
we
would
give
them
the
information,
mr.
bernstein.
if
i'm
selling
a
box
for
a
dollar
and
i
don't
give
you
the
information,
you
got
to
guess
at
my
price,
and
i
don't
want
you
guessing
68
cents
of
my
dollar
price.
if
you
are
going
to
cut
it,
i
would
rather
you
cut
a
penny
to
99,
don't
make
me
look
like
an
idiot,
that's
why
dixie
container
gives
prices.
other
officials
testify
the
exchange
of
information
presented
--
prevented
destructive
price
competition,
avoided
the
necessity
of
pricing
as
low
as
he
was
willing
to
go.
the
district
court
erroneously
because
it
insisted
on
a
further
agreement
ignored
this
evidence.
but,
even
if
we
didn't
have
this
evidence,
we
think
that
the
necessary
effect
here
where
you
have
information
requested
at
times
of
uncertainty
by
members
of
irrelatively
small
group
of
sellers,
six
of
whom
did
almost
60%
of
the
business.
under
circumstances,
where
self
interest
would
dictate
minimization
of
the
rigors
of
price
competition
and
where
the
buyers
demand
was
fixed.
we
think
that
under
such
a
situation,
so
long
as
pricing
was
clearly
visible
to
one
another,
so
long
as
any
uncertainty
was
avoided,
it
would
not
pay
anyone
substantially
to
cut
prices
since
the
others
could
know
of
match
the
cut,
and
the
share
of
the
business
would
have
to
remain
the
same
at
a
lower
profit.
the
individual
self
interest
of
each
participant
could
be
relied
upon
to
mitigate
competition.
once
the
combination
to
exchange
information
was
in
effect
unpredictably
and
this
is
very
important,
the
evidence
showed
in
the
court
found
that
in
the
majority
of
instances,
the
recipient
of
the
information
in
fact
quoted
substantially
the
same
price
it
had
received.
the
district
court
discusses
the
fact
that
the
information
exchange
was
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
informed
marketing
decisions.
but,
the
court
treats
informed
decision
making
with
an
undiscriminating
reverence
and
linseed
oil
and
american
column
revealed
the
dangers
of
over
specificity
on
current
prices.
the
point
is
that
but
for
the
information
exchange,
occasions
would
have
a
reason
when
the
defendants
would
have
been
slightly
in
the
dark
as
to
how
low
they
would
have
to
bid.
these
are
the
occasions
when
the
buyers
determine
it
is
not
in
their
self
interest
to
educate
the
bidders
as
to
the
precise
state
of
the
competition.
on
those
occasions,
but
for
the
combination,
the
competitors
would
have
consulted
their
own
cost
and
the
extensive
general
price
information
available
to
them
and
submitted
a
price
that
warranted
them
a
profit.
defendants
argue
that
without
the
information
they
may
have
bid
to
high.
but,
they
had
a
good
idea
of
the
level
of
prices
and
if
they
bid
to
high
the
buyer
would
probably
tell
them
and
in
fact
the
court
found
that
many
buyers
gave
high
bidders
a
second
chance
to
meet
the
lower
price.
it's
not
in
the
buyer's
interest
by
being
silent
to
induce
high
price.
he's
interested
in
doing
and
inducing
low
prices,
indeed
if
it
want
a
specific
information,
the
serious
risk
existed
that
the
uninformed
seller
would
bid
too
high
one
wonders
why
each
competitor
assisted
his
colleague
to
avoid
such
a
mistake.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
very
simply
mr.
justice
fortas,
they
could
and
did
exchange
through
their
trade
association.
information
as
to
past
pricing
behavior
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
at
the
--
every
ten
days,
they
would
compute
what
the
prices
had
been
previously.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
average
prices
with
some
breakdown
according
to
region,
some
breakdown
according
to
type
of
box.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes,
i
distinguish
between
that
and
prices
to
individual
customer.
secondly,
they
could
receive
from
the
buyers
information
as
to
what
the
competitors
were
selling
if
the
buyer
wanted
to
give
it
to
him.
we
have
no
objection
to
that.
thirdly,
they
could
publish
to
the
world
their
price
lists.
we
have
no
objection
to
that
because
price
list
are
general
and
people
can
discount
from
price
list
in
specific
cases.
it's
when
they
crawl
up
to
one
another
and
agree
upon
the
exchange
of
information
as
to
the
specific
price,
to
the
specific
customer.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
well,
yes!
we're
charging
a
combination
to
exchange
information,
an
agreement
to
exchange
information.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
well,
one
can
deduce
an
agreement
or
a
combination
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
we
are
charging
a
combination,
language
of
the
compliant
is
a
combination
with
--
by
agreement
to
exchange
prices.
that's
the
language
of
the
--
or
understanding.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
and
were
current.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
right.
current
either
because
they
were
current
quotes
or
current
because
they
were
last
sale
transactions
which
in
the
context
of
this
particular
industry
was
a
very
good
indication
of
what
the
seller
who
gave
that
information
would
next
charge.
now,
we
argue
that
the
buyer
would
not
ordinarily
act
against
the
self
interest
and
by
remaining
silent
co-sellers
to
bid
too
high,
and
we
think
that
as
this
court
has
recognized
extensive
and
specific
information
on
current
prices
available
to
a
relatively
small
group
of
sellers
buying
for
the
same
market,
will
resolve
in
mitigation
of
competition.
the
agreement
here,
the
combination
of
the
understanding
evidence
by
the
course
of
conduct
over
eight
years
and
before
can
be
understood
by
a
sellers
desire
to
avoid
the
possibility
that
his
opponent
had
kept
in
the
dark,
may
comment
at
a
lower
price
and
again,
i
note
the
explicit
testimony
which
reveal
this,
which
i
referred
to
earlier,
and
the
court's
finding
that
in
most
cases
in
fact,
upon
receiving
information,
the
recipient
quoted
the
same
price
as
the
price
furnished.
i'd
like
to
turn
for
a
moment
to
the
question
whether
there
was
a
combination.
the
court
below
seem
to
think
that
this
could
be
regarded
as
unilateral
conduct
as
in
theater
enterprises,
but
we're
not
dealing
with
unilateral
conduct
such
as
refusal
to
deal.
there
were
two
parties
to
each
request
and
each
answer.
furthermore,
the
district
court
itself
referred
to
an
implied
understanding
that
by
giving
the
information,
one
gets
the
right
to
request
the
information
and
indeed
i
read
appellee's
brief
of
page
13
to
concede
that.
hence,
the
conduct
is
not
only
bilateral
joint,
it's
interdependent.
one
simply
doesn't
do
it
without
reliance
in
what
the
others
are
doing.
this
is
evidence
by
the
fact
that
when
a
company
went
off
the
air,
it
went
off
the
air
both
ways.
it
didn't
continue
furnishing
information,
it
not
had
furnished
nor
requested
information.
the
district
court
was
also
mislead
by
the
fact
of
request
varied
in
frequency
that
information
was
supplied
in
different
forms
and
that
the
defendants
retain
the
freedom
to
stop
furnishing
information.
the
variations
and
frequency
merely
met
that
the
agreement
worked
when
it
had
to,
namely
in
those
occasions
where
there
was
uncertainty.
where
the
buyer
wasn't
talking
or
wasn't
being
accurate.
the
different
forms
of
the
information
as
i
try
to
explain
to
you
mr.
justice
fortas
did
not
make
very
much
difference
because
with
the
manuals
that
existed
here
and
with
the
practices
of
the
trade,
the
information
was
readily
translatable
and
we
can't
assume
that
the
parties
here
were
engaged
in
a
useless
exchange
of
stale
information.
finally,
the
fact
that
each
company
maintain
its
freedom
to
furnish
information
is
another
way
of
stating
that
it
pertain
that
the
right
to
depart
and
go
off
the
air.
the
fact
that
they
usually
furnish
information,
rather
than
always
furnish
information
does
not
mean
that
there
was
not
a
course
of
conduct
here,
such
usual
conduct
over
an
eight
year
period
is
evidenced
enough
of
a
combination
even
the
most
explicitly
conceived
conspiracy
does
not
operate
to
perfection.
thank
you.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
were
not
relying
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
no,
i
was
saying
that
it
confirms
--
we're
arguing
that
the
necessary
effect
here
is
to
inhibit

mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
right.
defendants
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
to
be

to
be
expected
when
you
have
overcapacity,
but
the
point
is
that
the
adjustment
isn't
being
made
properly.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
you
establish
a
restraint
of
trade
in
this
type
of
case
when
you
assume
that
the
necessary
effect
--
look,
the
purpose
of
this
if
you
accept
the
government's
view,
was
to
avoid
unnecessary
price
cutting.
inadvertent
price
cutting
due
to
ignorance
of
what
the
buyer
is
getting.
they
therefore
enter
the
combination,
if
you
accept
our
view.
the
combination
provides
the
precise
information
which
avoids
that
uncertainty.
we
argue
under
those
circumstances,
the
necessary
effect
is
to
ameliorate,
not
to
end
price
competition.
there
are
many
cases
here
in
which
the
buyer
would
reveal
the
price
and
there
would
be
competition.
there
was
ample
price
information
to
the
parties,
so
that
the
economic
forces
that
worked
would
be
working,
but
the
point
is,
it
was
not
working
as
it
should
have
and
this
is
evidenced,
we
think
though,
i'm
not
relying
on
it,
by
the
fact
that
you
have
chronic
overcapacity
and
entry.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
because
you're
deprived
by
having
the
sellers
agree
with
another
that
they
will
get
the
price
if
the
buyer
doesn't
--
deprive
the
buyer
in
a
situation
where
he
probably
needs
it
of
a
bargaining
to
namely
silence.
that's
the
difference.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
i'm
--
again,
i
have
to
give
the
same
answer
that
mr.
seymour
gave
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
know.
the
only
information
that
i
have
is
that
the
president
of
the
dixie
company
testified
that
he
exchanged
information
only
with
people
that
he
could
trust.
some
suggestion
that
the
exchange
may
not
have
included
everyone
in
the
industry
but
beyond
that
i
cannot
say
and
i
don't
think
the
record
were
disclosed.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
well,
we
picked
out
all
the
substantial
companies,
there
were
a
number
of
new
entrance,
i
don't
know
how
many
of
the
other
companies
would
have
been
relatively
new
entrants
and
i
assume
that
we
chose
those
on
as
to
whom
we
had
evidence.
the
grand
jury
which
began
this
was
inspired
by
a
complaint
of
a
costumer
and
i
suppose
we
tract
the
grand
jury
to
see
who
was
involved
in
this.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
no,
i
think
the
rule
we
are
advancing
here
mr.
justice
fortas
is
that
when
you
have
an
industry
which
is
dominated
by
a
relatively,
relatively
small
number
of
sellers,
then
the
precise
exchange
of
current
price
information
with
respect
to
particular
costumers
necessarily
as
an
inhibiting
effect
on
pricing
because
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
of
the
ability
of
that
small
group
to
visualize
the
necessary
consequence.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
as
to
effect.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
as
to
effect.
now,
in
this
case,
we
have
explicit
proof
that
this
was
their
purpose
but
the
court
ignored
it
because
it
seem
to
think
we
had
to
prove
a
subsequent
agreement
and
we
don't,
an
american
column
makes
it
clear
that
we
don't.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
well,
yes
we
have
specific
findings
which
indicate
that
when
the
information
was
supplied,
the
recipient
quoted
the
same
price,
we
have
that
but
we
did
not
even
attempt
to
go
into
the
question
of
what
was
happening
to
prices
that
it
seem
to
us
is
not
necessary
after
the
socony-vacuum
case.

mr.

well,
i
would

that
one
can
infer
that
if

perhaps
they
weren't

mr.

interesting
case.

is
a
case
in
which
the
court
found
illegally
exchange
of
information
with
365
sellers
representing
but
33%
of
the
industry.
maple
flooring
was
a
case
in
which
the
information
exchange
was
only
as
to
past
transactions
without
identity
of
particular
costumers,
neither
of
which
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
i
think
there
were
about
22.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
i
believe
so.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
i
think
they
had
most
of
the
business
but
there
was
no
exchange
of
current
or
specific
price
information
and
the
maple
flooring
exchange
indeed
went
on
here
and
we
didn't
challenge
it,
that's
what
the
trade
association
was
doing.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
oh,
we
do
not
claim
any
evidence
that
the
price
went
up.
we
are
not
--
we
are
not
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
i
stated
that
the
purpose
of
the
exchange
as
to
explicit
information
was
to
avoid
unnecessary
in
terms
price
cutting.
that
in
order
to
eliminate
doubt
as
to
what
the
price
was
so
that
there
wouldn't
be
price
cutting.
they
exchanged
specific
information
as
to
prices
a
seller
was
quoting
to
a
specific
costumer
and
this
was
the
arrangement
and
this
was
the
combination.
