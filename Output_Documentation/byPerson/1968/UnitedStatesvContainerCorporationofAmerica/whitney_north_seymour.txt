mr.
whitney
north
seymour
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
in
the
few
minutes,
just
try
to
summarize
the
situation
as
i
see
it
as
a
result
of
mr.
zimmerman's
argument.
this
case
were
filing
--
all
the
respondents
who
filed
the
common
brief
in
this
case
because
the
question
was
common
to
all
of
them,
the
common
denominator
was
that
all
of
the
defendants
from
time
to
time,
when
they
couldn't
get
the
information
from
their
own
records
and
they
didn't
trust
the
information
when
they
got
it
from
the
buyer,
would
call
up
another
manufacturer
and
ask
him
for
his
last
price,
and
this
was
done
by
telephone,
and
this
is
the
universal
practice
which
is
challenged
in
this
case
and
the
government
says
on
that
fact
alone
and
the
speculation
that
people
would
not
cut
their
prices
anymore
and
they
had
to,
we
will
establish
the
combination
of
violation
of
the
law.
now
it
--
the
meetings
that
counsel
has
talked
about
as
your
honors
will
find
are
few
smaller
trait
gossip
meetings
involving
three
or
four
of
the
defendants
not
challenged
as
illegal
and
not
a
part
of
this
practice
at
all.
they
were
just
thrown
in
for
color
and
the
practice
was
this
telephoning
practice
which
i
referred
to.
now,
mr.
zimmerman
said
that
after
they
telephoned,
the
fellow
got
the
information
was
nominally
free
to
go
about
his
business.
it's
stipulated
and
it's
found
that
every
one
of
the
prices
fixed
was
priced
--
was
fixed
in
the
individual
judgment
of
the
seller
in
his
business
judgment
alone.
he
was
nominally
free,
he
was
free
and
he
exercised
that
freedom
and
there's
not
a
word
of
proof
in
this
case
that
he
was
under
any
restraint
or
under
any
coercion.
now,
come
after
recess
to
the
precise
manner
of
competition.
and
the
fact
that
there
was
wholesale
price
cutting
in
this
industry.
the
prices
went
down
and
the
prices
vary,
people
were
taking
away
customers
all
the
time
from
other
people
and
they
were
not
nominally
free,
they
were
free,
that's
the
heart
of
it.
now,
what
is
the
government
really
challenging
here?
the
government
is
really
challenging
the
maple
flooring
decision
under
the
guys
of
not
challenging
it
by
saying,
that
when
there's
an
exchange
of
price
information
or
when
there's
price
information
furnished
and
the
word
exchange
is
not
an
accurate
one,
because
there
wasn't
an
exchange
here,
each
companies
sometimes
go
to
another
company
and
gather
information,
it's
only
in
that
sense
that
there
was
an
exchange.
what
they're
really
saying
is
that
such
a
practice,
one
not
disapproved,
not
specifically
disapproved
in
a
consent
decree
which
has
been
on
the
books
for
28
years
and
which
everybody
has
relied
upon,
that
such
a
practice
is
now
per
se
unlawful,
and
that
the
court
are
to
so
declare
because
this
case
was
tried
on
a
stipulation,
the
findings
were
largely
agreed
too,
where
the
findings
weren't
agreed
to,
they
were
based
upon
documents
or
other
stipulation.
and
so,
the
government
is
coming
in
and
asking
the
court
somehow
to
review
not
this
ordinary
findings
of
the
district
court,
but
are
to
renegotiate
the
stipulation,
and
though
i
submit
that
when
your
honors
look
at
the
stipulation
and
the
findings,
you'll
find
that
the
conclusion
of
the
district
court
reach
was
inescapable
on
this
record.
now,
if
there
is
a
case,
some
other
case,
in
which
there
is
supplying
of
price
information
and
some
kind
of
an
agreement
as
to
the
prices,
some
kind
of
a
stabilizing
of
the
prices,
some
kind
of
a
uniform
of
the
prices,
none
of
which
were
present
here.
let
them
bring
such
a
case
and
give
this
court
and
the
trial
court
the
economic
pieces
which
this
court
has
insisted
in
white
motors
and
others
is
essential
if
it's
to
expand
the
group
of
per
se
violations.
this
is
not
a
proper
case
for
expansion.
so,
that
that's
the
summary
of
our
position
and
i
will
--
just
say
this
in
addition
before
the
lunch
recess.
this
was
a
practice
followed
by
the
18
defendants
in
this
case.
those
in
existence
said
that
the
time
of
the
consent
decree
by
them
and
by
their
successors,
large
and
small
and
it
was
regarded
as
vital
to
their
operation
to
know
what
the
price
alternatives
of
buyers
are,
and
that's
stipulated,
and
that's
agreed
and
they
agreed
findings.
this
is
vital
information
and
it's
stipulated
as
to
each
company
that
the
company
needed
the
information
in
order
to
compete.
this
was
a
highly
competitive
business
as
your
honors
will
when
you
see
the
charge.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
of
course,
otherwise
you're
asked
to
fire
a
cannon
without
knowing
where
the
target
is.
and
i
submit
that
the
idea
that
our
great
economy
has
been
built
by
balancing
demand
and
supply
into
a
position
where
it
can't
grow
or
shouldn't
grow
is
a
kind
of
a
fantastic
approach
to
the
problem.
may
it
please
the
court,
perhaps
just
a
little
more
on
the
nature
of
this
industry,
as
i
think
i've
said
this
case
challenges
the
trade
practice
which
goes
back
to
at
least
1940
when
the
consent
decree
which
did
not
enjoined
the
dissemination
of
information
on
best
transactions
was
entered.
there
are
18
of
the
51
companies
in
the
southeastern
part
of
the
united
states
involved
in
the
case.
the
number
of
companies
and
the
number
of
plants
has
grown
because
the
business
of
the
customers
have
grown
has
been
an
enormous
increase
in
the
furniture
business
in
the
southeast
and
that's
one
to
the
main
purposes
of
the
use
of
these
containers.
the
containers
are
used
to
ship
furniture,
fruit,
cigarettes
and
other
things
while
they're
made
to
specifications
anyone
of
the
companies
can
make
them.
there's
no
published
market.
there
is
no
--
there
are
few
published
price
list
and
therefore
in
order
to
get
information
to
enable
a
company
to
compete,
it
has
to
get
it
somewhere,
and
the
court
found
that
--
and
it
was
stipulated
that
it
was
vital
to
have
information
about
buyers
alternatives
here
as
elsewhere
and
the
usual
method
of
getting
information
was
to
--
if
the
seller
had
to
sell
the
purchaser
before
to
look
at
his
own
records
and
if
not
to
ask
the
potential
customer
what
he
was
buying
for
and
usually
the
customer
supplied
that
information,
obviously
it
was
to
their
advantage
to
do
so.
and
if
not
that
then
occasionally
and
usually
according
to
the
findings
where
they
had
some
doubt
about
information
which
was
supplied
by
the
customers,
did
the
practice
of
telephoning
and
getting
information
from
the
competitors.
but,
when
the
information
was
obtained
from
competitors
while
the
findings
indicate
that
in
a
majority
of
cases,
the
new
potential
supplier
would
bid
the
same
amount
that
he
understood
was
being
bid
by
his
competitors,
if
he
couldn't
get
the
business
that
way,
he
cut
the
price
and
if
he
cut
the
price,
the
old
supplier
would
cut
the
price
and
it
happened
all
the
time.
and
the
findings
indicate
that
price
competition
was
rife,
that
it
was
highly
competitive
business
and
that
this
practice
of
price
cutting
went
all
the
time
and
i'm
going
to
show
you
some
affirmative
evidence
or
i'll
tell
you
about
some
affirmative
evidence
before
i
get
through.
as
i
said
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes
sir.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
can't
answer
that.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
can't
answer
that
but
i
have
no
reason
to
doubt
that
it
is.
i
don't
know
whether
or
not
the
case
was
brought
charging
only
these
18,
nobody
ever
inquired
about
the
others
but
i
can
assume
that
an
industry
practice
of
this
character
is
probably
followed
by
everybody.
the
consent
decree
was
relied
on
by
everybody
and
probably
the
practice
was
followed
by
anybody
but
i
can't
answer
your
honors
specifically.
i
said
before
recess
that
this
case
was
submitted
largely
on
stipulated
facts
and
i
think
its
important
to
realized
that
because
its
upon
the
stipulations
and
the
agreed
findings
that
the
court
below
largely
based
its
judgment
and
mr.
louis
bronstein
who
was
here
handled
the
case
for
the
government
in
the
lower
court
and
handled
it
in
a
various
statesmen's
like
fashion.
he
is
a
very
able
and
tough
adversary.
the
court
urged
the
parties
to
try
to
get
together
on
stipulations
instead
of
taking
the
court's
time
with
a
lot
of
miscellaneous
testimony
and
exhibits
and
after
mr.
bronstein
had
deposed
34
representatives
of
the
defendants,
they
proceeded
to
the
stipulation
table
and
after
some
months
there,
the
stipulations
which
are
in
this
record
were
arrived
at
and
i
submit
that
its
not
an
occasion
for
looking
in
to
little
fragments
of
the
deposition
as
mr.
zimmerman
did
in
one
reference
this
morning
in
saying
“well,
look
at
this,
here
the
government
has
stipulated
the
facts,
the
basic
facts,
the
broad
sweep
of
facts
and
i
submit
there's
no
occasion
for
the
court
to
have
to
revert
to
these
depositions
but
if
you
do,
you
find
as
in
most
other
depositions
or
testimony
of
34
witnesses
that
some
say
one
thing
and
some
say
another
and
its
out
of
the
total
of
this
that
this
stipulation
was
arrived
at.”
and
you
can
find
a
little
fragment
here,
a
little
fragment
there
that
will
support
almost
anything
but
you
can't
find
any
that
will
show
that
there
was
any
agreement
on
price
or
that
anybody
was
constrained
as
to
what
price
he
should
charge,
he
didn't
have
full
freedom
of
action
and
that
i
submit
is
the
key
to
it.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
i
have
no
doubt
it
would
be
pointed
to
as
some
evidence
of
that
but
you
barely
need
to
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
mr.
zimmerman
if
i
understood
him
said,
if
you
assume
the
effects,
you
can
establish
the
restraint
and
that's
the
government's
case.
they
assume
without
any
proof
that
it
has
have
this
effect
upon
competition
and
upon
that
assumption
they
say
there
was
a
combination
and
restraint
of
trade.
the
trouble
with
that
is
there's
no
such
proof
and
so
it's
only
a
matter
of
assumption.
now,
just
on
the
fact
--
factor
stipulation,
one
other
thing
which
i
think
is
significant.
the
stipulations
were
arrived
at
after
the
government
had
a
grand
jury
investigation
which
did
not
result
in
an
indictment
when
they
called
many
witnesses,
when
they
gotten
thousands
of
documents
and
we
supply,
the
defendants
supplied
the
list
of
10,000
costumers
and
they
apparently
found
no
costumer
who
complained
about
this
practice
because
no
costumer
was
ever
called
and
there's
no
testimony
or
stipulation
showing
what
a
costumer
would
testify
on
this
subject
and
i
submit
that
the
case
is
not
a
proper
one
for
the
court
to
go
behind
the
stipulations
and
as
if
the
parties
had
made
different
stipulations.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes,
and
if
your
honor
will
look
in
volume
one
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
that
the
agreed
findings
begin
at
page
55
and
run
on
for
150
pages
and
those
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
those
are
the
findings
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
where
the
indication
in
the
margin
as
to
whether
they
were
agreed
or
not
agreed
and
those,
the
agreed
findings
are
the
basis
for
the
trial
court's
findings
and
those
agreed
findings
in
turn
were
based
upon
the
underlying
stipulation
which
is
also
in
this
record,
the
several
stipulations.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes.
where
there
were
--
if
your
honor
will
look
at
that
agreed
set
of
findings,
you
will
see
some
matters
which
are
underlined.
where
the
parties
did
not
agree
and
there
in
some
cases,
the
court
basing
his
conclusion
on
the
stipulation
or
documents
of
record
made
independent
findings
but
the
critical
findings,
the
dispositive
findings
here
stem
from
the
stipulation
and
the
agreement
i
think.
now,
--
if
your
honors
will
look
at
the
sweep
of
those
agreed
findings
and
the
sweep
of
the
practice
of
price
competition
and
the
need
for
this
information
and
how
it
was
used,
you'll
see
one
other
thing
which
i
ought
to
mention
at
this
stage.
if
a
supplier
had
supplied
the
costumer
before
he
could
find
out
the
price
of
course
by
looking
at
his
own
records,
the
price
he
charged.
now,
one
did
not
always
adhere
to
the
same
price
and
he
couldn't
rely
on
the
fact
that
another
supplier
would
adhere
to
the
same
price
because
it's
also
stipulated
that
if
there
were
changes
in
cost
or
changes
in
supply
or
changes
in
specifications,
those
prices
would
not
be
adhered
to.
so
you
cannot
take
it
just
because
the
price
was
charged
once
that
it
will
still
be
the
charge
--
the
same
charge.
after
the
costumer
or
after
the
records
of
the
supplier
as
a
source,
the
supplier
would
then
ask
the
costumer
and
the
costumer
would
supply
information,
sometimes
information
which
the
supplier
doubted
but
usually
supplied
information.
now,
the
important
part
of
this
is
that
it
didn't
make
the
slightest
difference
where
the
information
was
obtained
as
to
how
the
seller
who
got
the
information
behaved.
he
behaved
in
exactly
the
same
way
in
seeking
further
business,
whether
he
got
the
information
from
his
records
or
from
a
costumer
or
from
a
competitor
and
therefore
to
say
that
any
of
the
alleged
defects
stem
from
this
exchange
of
price
information
seems
to
me
to
be
without
foundation.
now,
i'm
going
to
push
on
here
and
say
only
that
as
we've
said
in
our
brief,
it
--
i
think
the
government's
statement
of
the
questions
really
rather
elides
the
fact
that
so
much
of
this
record
was
stipulated
and
basis
it
rather
on
some
fragments
here
and
there.
i
said
before
recess
that
it
really
were
there
was
a
common
denominator
here
of
the
practice
which
was
challenged,
which
was
the
practice
of
getting
information
by
a
telephone
and
then
supplying
it
in
due
course
when
it
was
asked
for
on
a
wholly
different
transaction.
mr.
zimmerman
said
this
morning
that
in
some
cases,
people
gave
not
only
past
transaction
information
but
current
code
information.
now,
its
clear
from
the
findings
that
only
a
part
of
all
the
defendants
ever
supplied
the
code
information
but
the
case
was
tried
on
the
assumption
that
it
was
the
common
denominator
information
that
was
the
thing
that
bound
all
these
defendants
together
and
therefore
i
submit
that
there's
no
occasion
to
explore
separately
the
few
cases
where
there
was
quotation
information
supplied.
if
that
made
a
difference,
the
court
would
have
to
dispose
of
the
case
by
dismissing
as
to
some
and
not
as
to
others
and
what
the
government
was
trying
to
do
as
it
just
trying
to
do
here
is
to
hold
all
the
defendants
together
on
the
exchange
of
information
about
past
transactions.
the
fact
that
some
defendants
might
have
interpreted
that
phrase
differently,
i
think
does
not
affect
the
basic
legal
position.
now,
on
the
question
of
combination,
i
won't
take
any
real
time
on
that.
i
must
say
that
the
cases
don't
clarify
entirely
what
is
a
combination
and
what
is
a
conspiracy
or
an
agreement.
here,
what
happened
was
that
a
supplier
would
call
up
another
supplier
and
ask
for
some
information.
knowing
that
in
due
course
that
supplier
might
expect
to
have
the
courtesy
reciprocated
not
in
connection
with
that
transaction
but
in
connection
with
the
wholly
different
transaction
and
that's
all
there
is
in
the
way
of
consensual
basis
for
whatever
this
--
whatever
you
want
to
call
this.
each
supplier
had
sometime
asked
and
then
as
a
matter
of
reciprocal
courtesy
at
some
other
time
supplied
some
information.
sometimes
a
few
request,
sometimes
more
request
and
so
you
have
a
sort
of
a
situation
of
reciprocal
commercial
courtesy
at
work.
now,
the
government
says
that's
enough
to
make
it
a
combination.
it
seems
to
me
not
to
fit
any
of
the
existing
authorities
on
that
subject
but
it
isn't
vital
because
if
it
was
a
combination,
it
was
not
a
combination
to
restrain
trade
because
it
did
not
result
in
restraining
in
any
degree
the
price
which
any
supplier
would
get
for
his
product.
it
did
neither
coerce
nor
restrained
and
so
however
you
break
it
down.
if
you
say
it
was
a
combination,
it
was
not
a
combination
in
restraint
of
trade.
my
own
view
is
that
the
district
court
was
quite
right
on
this
record
in
concluding
that
this
was
sort
of
like
the
mutual
courtesies
which
we
all
do
each
other
and
which
cannot
be
regarded
as
a
combination
just
because
we
expect
when
we
give
him.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
think
not,
but
there
are
small
suppliers
in
the
group.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
no,
nothing
of
a
kind.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
it's
absolutely
neutral
on
that
subject.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
may
i
at
this
time
ask
those
of
your
honors
who
want
to
look
at
charter
two,
look
at
volume
three
which
contains
significant
information.
the
government
put
in
no
proof
about
the
course
of
price
history
and
the
defendant's
confronted
with
this
kind
of
a
record
did
their
best
and
these
charts
in
volume
three
show
it.
now,
the
first
chart
in
volume
three
shows
how
prices
of
everything
else
was
going
up
while
the
prices
of
containers
were
coming
down,
a
practice
which
result
which
one
would
not
expect
if
there
was
any
kind
of
a
price
conspiracy
or
price
fixing
arrangement
however
tenuous.
the
next
group
of
charts
shows
how
the
prices
varied
between
the
defendant's
plants
and
shows
that
there
was
absolutely
no
uniformity
of
price
as
between
the
defendants
or
within
plants.
the
next
group
of
charts
which
is
a
very
significant
group
which
begins
about
the
middle
or
begins
on
page
21,
shows
the
business
gained
and
lost
by
these
defendants
and
it
shows
on
page
22
for
example,
in
those
columns
that
each
of
this
companies
in
every
year
gain
some
business
and
lost
some
business
to
competitors.
and
for
example
in
this
chart
on
page
22,
the
container
corporation
which
is
my
plant
in
the
year
1960
did
business
with
about
a
third
of
--
about
of
third
of
its
costumers
were
people
with
whom
it
had
not
done
any
business
the
year
before
and
about
a
third
where
people
with
whom
it
didn't
do
any
business
the
year
following.
now,
it's
found
and
stipulated
that
generally
speaking,
costumers
change
suppliers
only
when
they
got
a
cut
in
price
and
therefore
it's
reasonable
to
infer
that
all
this
changes
were
results
of
the
price
competition
in
the
industry
and
the
fact
that
there
was
widespread
price
cutting.
now
beyond
that,
the
next
group
of
charts
shows
how
the
price
went
in
almost
--
almost
like
a
seismograph
during
a
convulsion
and
the
prices
went
like
this
as
between
companies
and
as
between
plants
and
because
of
the
difficulty
of
getting
more
than
five
lines
on
a
single
chart,
that
these
are
rather
grouped
geographically
as
plants
of
various
competitors
but
your
honors
will
see
as
you
look
through
this
that
the
price
was
all
over
the
place
and
was
all
over
the
places
between
plants
and
as
between
defendants.
and
then
going
on,
there's
another
series
of
charts
stored
at
the
back
of
the
volume
which
shows
that
there
was
a
great
variation
from
so-called
manuals.
now,
each
company
had
a
manual
which
views
to
compute
price
although
they
were
rarely
if
ever
published
and
their
manual
was
departed
from
as
shown
here
both
up
and
down,
usually
down
for
manual.
so,
nobody
who
knew
what
anybody
else's
manual
is
could
surely
compute
the
price.
and
then
finally,
there's
another
group
of
charts
in
that
same
part
of
the
volume
which
show
departure
from
board
prices
which
is
another
possible
way
of
computing
the
price.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
think
that's
--
i
think
that's
perfectly
evident.
what
they're
saying
is,
were
entitled
to
bar
this
access
to
knowledge
among
competitors
who
must
there
after
compete
in
ignorance
because
we
say
the
effect
might
be
to
somehow
chill
price
competition.
when
there's
no
proof
of
that,
the
proof
is
of
the
most
active
kind
of
price
competition,
the
most
destructive
kind
because
it
takes
costumers
away
in
large
numbers
year
to
year,
and
that
in
my
view
is
exactly
what
the
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes
sir.
that
concession
was
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
the
--
i
think
the
governments
position
in
the
lower
court
was
if
they
just
charge
exchange
“a
price
information”
they
would
have
no
case.
they
went
beyond
that
and
charge
the
effective
price
information
but
they
didn't
prove
any
such
effect.
they
relied
as
to
its
effect
on
what
they
said
was
the
natural
effect
of
the
exchange.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
think
what
the
court
is
saying
really
is
that
you
have
to
have
a
combination
which
restraints
trade
and
if
there
was
a
combination,
it
didn't
show
any
restraint
of
trade.
and
what
do
you
say
its
one
agreement
or
two
agreements
doesn't
make
much
difference.
the
fact
is
that
they
did
not
prove
any
such
restraint,
the
record
shows
the
contrary
and
now,
let
me
push
on
very
rapidly
just
to
touch
on
the
couple
of
other
points.
the
government
relies
here
on
the
cases
decided
before
maple
flooring,
american
column
and
linseed
oil
and
the
sugar
institute
case
decided
after
maple
flooring
and
says
these,
this
arrangement
was
or
this
combination
was
invalid
under
those
cases.
now,
i
won't
take
your
honors
time
to
try
to
describe
those
cases
but
your
honors
will
recall
that
they
were
very
tight
and
explicit
arrangements
by
which
in
every
case,
information
about
prices
was
supplied,
there
was
per
leasing
of
the
price
structure.
in
the
column
case,
the
prices
went
up
over
a
300%
as
a
result
of
the
arrangement.
in
the
other
case,
they
were
stabilized.
there
were
fines
and
forfeitures
in
the
linseed
oil
case
for
any
departure
and
there's
nothing
of
that
kind
here
and
maple
flooring
i
submit
lays
down
the
principle
that
knowledge
which
invokes
the
self
interest
of
sellers
and
lets
the
sellers
use
the
knowledge
to
compete
in
any
way
that
suits
there
situation
which
is
the
situation
here
clearly
permits.
the
kind
of
information
that
was
supplied
here
and
that
was
recognized
when
the
consent
decree
was
made
and
largely
in
reliance
on
the
maple
flooring
case
but
my
friend
says,
“well,
in
maple
flooring,
they
didn't
have
any
information
about
particular
costumers.”
but
they
did
in
the
cement
institute
case
and
the
cement
institute
case,
information
was
supplied
about
particular
costumers
because
of
the
fact
that
in
that
case,
it
was
the
practice
to
order
cement
from
a
lot
of
different
suppliers
in
order
to
get
a
lower
price
even
if
you
weren't
going
to
use
it
and
that
was
kind
of
a
commercial
fraud
and
the
information
about
that
could
be
exchanged.
i
don't
say
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes,
sir.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
it
was
a
broad
--
it
was
broad
price
fixing
charge
which
included
references
to
an
earlier
trade
association,
one
not
involved
here
and
the
one
involved
here
is
not
charged
at
all
and
the
injunction
provisions
and
the
consent
decree
bar
the
kind
of
trade
association
activity
which
were
involved
in
the
earlier
case.
but
they
exempt
the
exchange
or
dissemination
of
information
about
past
transactions
and
it
stipulated
and
found
that
every
defendant
relied
upon
the
provisions
of
that
consent
decree
and
doing
the
business
this
way.
and
i
submit
that
of
course
the
consent
decree
is
not
binding
on
your
honors
but
at
some
precedent
for
the
fact
that
the
government
has
recognized
for
a
long,
long
time
that
this
practice
does
not
have
the
pernicious
effects
alleged
now
and
if
this
practice
elsewhere
does
have
such
pernicious
effects
so
that
your
honors
can
be
asked
to
extend
again
the
area
of
first
day
violation,
it
ought
to
be
approved
and
ought
not
to
be
assumed
just
on
the
basis
of
speculation.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
in
the
few
minutes,
just
try
to
summarize
the
situation
as
i
see
it
as
a
result
of
mr.
zimmerman's
argument.
this
case
were
filing
--
all
the
respondents
who
filed
the
common
brief
in
this
case
because
the
question
was
common
to
all
of
them,
the
common
denominator
was
that
all
of
the
defendants
from
time
to
time,
when
they
couldn't
get
the
information
from
their
own
records
and
they
didn't
trust
the
information
when
they
got
it
from
the
buyer,
would
call
up
another
manufacturer
and
ask
him
for
his
last
price,
and
this
was
done
by
telephone,
and
this
is
the
universal
practice
which
is
challenged
in
this
case
and
the
government
says
on
that
fact
alone
and
the
speculation
that
people
would
not
cut
their
prices
anymore
and
they
had
to,
we
will
establish
the
combination
of
violation
of
the
law.
now
it
--
the
meetings
that
counsel
has
talked
about
as
your
honors
will
find
are
few
smaller
trait
gossip
meetings
involving
three
or
four
of
the
defendants
not
challenged
as
illegal
and
not
a
part
of
this
practice
at
all.
they
were
just
thrown
in
for
color
and
the
practice
was
this
telephoning
practice
which
i
referred
to.
now,
mr.
zimmerman
said
that
after
they
telephoned,
the
fellow
got
the
information
was
nominally
free
to
go
about
his
business.
it's
stipulated
and
it's
found
that
every
one
of
the
prices
fixed
was
priced
--
was
fixed
in
the
individual
judgment
of
the
seller
in
his
business
judgment
alone.
he
was
nominally
free,
he
was
free
and
he
exercised
that
freedom
and
there's
not
a
word
of
proof
in
this
case
that
he
was
under
any
restraint
or
under
any
coercion.
now,
come
after
recess
to
the
precise
manner
of
competition.
and
the
fact
that
there
was
wholesale
price
cutting
in
this
industry.
the
prices
went
down
and
the
prices
vary,
people
were
taking
away
customers
all
the
time
from
other
people
and
they
were
not
nominally
free,
they
were
free,
that's
the
heart
of
it.
now,
what
is
the
government
really
challenging
here?
the
government
is
really
challenging
the
maple
flooring
decision
under
the
guys
of
not
challenging
it
by
saying,
that
when
there's
an
exchange
of
price
information
or
when
there's
price
information
furnished
and
the
word
exchange
is
not
an
accurate
one,
because
there
wasn't
an
exchange
here,
each
companies
sometimes
go
to
another
company
and
gather
information,
it's
only
in
that
sense
that
there
was
an
exchange.
what
they're
really
saying
is
that
such
a
practice,
one
not
disapproved,
not
specifically
disapproved
in
a
consent
decree
which
has
been
on
the
books
for
28
years
and
which
everybody
has
relied
upon,
that
such
a
practice
is
now
per
se
unlawful,
and
that
the
court
are
to
so
declare
because
this
case
was
tried
on
a
stipulation,
the
findings
were
largely
agreed
too,
where
the
findings
weren't
agreed
to,
they
were
based
upon
documents
or
other
stipulation.
and
so,
the
government
is
coming
in
and
asking
the
court
somehow
to
review
not
this
ordinary
findings
of
the
district
court,
but
are
to
renegotiate
the
stipulation,
and
though
i
submit
that
when
your
honors
look
at
the
stipulation
and
the
findings,
you'll
find
that
the
conclusion
of
the
district
court
reach
was
inescapable
on
this
record.
now,
if
there
is
a
case,
some
other
case,
in
which
there
is
supplying
of
price
information
and
some
kind
of
an
agreement
as
to
the
prices,
some
kind
of
a
stabilizing
of
the
prices,
some
kind
of
a
uniform
of
the
prices,
none
of
which
were
present
here.
let
them
bring
such
a
case
and
give
this
court
and
the
trial
court
the
economic
pieces
which
this
court
has
insisted
in
white
motors
and
others
is
essential
if
it's
to
expand
the
group
of
per
se
violations.
this
is
not
a
proper
case
for
expansion.
so,
that
that's
the
summary
of
our
position
and
i
will
--
just
say
this
in
addition
before
the
lunch
recess.
this
was
a
practice
followed
by
the
18
defendants
in
this
case.
those
in
existence
said
that
the
time
of
the
consent
decree
by
them
and
by
their
successors,
large
and
small
and
it
was
regarded
as
vital
to
their
operation
to
know
what
the
price
alternatives
of
buyers
are,
and
that's
stipulated,
and
that's
agreed
and
they
agreed
findings.
this
is
vital
information
and
it's
stipulated
as
to
each
company
that
the
company
needed
the
information
in
order
to
compete.
this
was
a
highly
competitive
business
as
your
honors
will
when
you
see
the
charge.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
of
course,
otherwise
you're
asked
to
fire
a
cannon
without
knowing
where
the
target
is.
and
i
submit
that
the
idea
that
our
great
economy
has
been
built
by
balancing
demand
and
supply
into
a
position
where
it
can't
grow
or
shouldn't
grow
is
a
kind
of
a
fantastic
approach
to
the
problem.
may
it
please
the
court,
perhaps
just
a
little
more
on
the
nature
of
this
industry,
as
i
think
i've
said
this
case
challenges
the
trade
practice
which
goes
back
to
at
least
1940
when
the
consent
decree
which
did
not
enjoined
the
dissemination
of
information
on
best
transactions
was
entered.
there
are
18
of
the
51
companies
in
the
southeastern
part
of
the
united
states
involved
in
the
case.
the
number
of
companies
and
the
number
of
plants
has
grown
because
the
business
of
the
customers
have
grown
has
been
an
enormous
increase
in
the
furniture
business
in
the
southeast
and
that's
one
to
the
main
purposes
of
the
use
of
these
containers.
the
containers
are
used
to
ship
furniture,
fruit,
cigarettes
and
other
things
while
they're
made
to
specifications
anyone
of
the
companies
can
make
them.
there's
no
published
market.
there
is
no
--
there
are
few
published
price
list
and
therefore
in
order
to
get
information
to
enable
a
company
to
compete,
it
has
to
get
it
somewhere,
and
the
court
found
that
--
and
it
was
stipulated
that
it
was
vital
to
have
information
about
buyers
alternatives
here
as
elsewhere
and
the
usual
method
of
getting
information
was
to
--
if
the
seller
had
to
sell
the
purchaser
before
to
look
at
his
own
records
and
if
not
to
ask
the
potential
customer
what
he
was
buying
for
and
usually
the
customer
supplied
that
information,
obviously
it
was
to
their
advantage
to
do
so.
and
if
not
that
then
occasionally
and
usually
according
to
the
findings
where
they
had
some
doubt
about
information
which
was
supplied
by
the
customers,
did
the
practice
of
telephoning
and
getting
information
from
the
competitors.
but,
when
the
information
was
obtained
from
competitors
while
the
findings
indicate
that
in
a
majority
of
cases,
the
new
potential
supplier
would
bid
the
same
amount
that
he
understood
was
being
bid
by
his
competitors,
if
he
couldn't
get
the
business
that
way,
he
cut
the
price
and
if
he
cut
the
price,
the
old
supplier
would
cut
the
price
and
it
happened
all
the
time.
and
the
findings
indicate
that
price
competition
was
rife,
that
it
was
highly
competitive
business
and
that
this
practice
of
price
cutting
went
all
the
time
and
i'm
going
to
show
you
some
affirmative
evidence
or
i'll
tell
you
about
some
affirmative
evidence
before
i
get
through.
as
i
said
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes
sir.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
can't
answer
that.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
can't
answer
that
but
i
have
no
reason
to
doubt
that
it
is.
i
don't
know
whether
or
not
the
case
was
brought
charging
only
these
18,
nobody
ever
inquired
about
the
others
but
i
can
assume
that
an
industry
practice
of
this
character
is
probably
followed
by
everybody.
the
consent
decree
was
relied
on
by
everybody
and
probably
the
practice
was
followed
by
anybody
but
i
can't
answer
your
honors
specifically.
i
said
before
recess
that
this
case
was
submitted
largely
on
stipulated
facts
and
i
think
its
important
to
realized
that
because
its
upon
the
stipulations
and
the
agreed
findings
that
the
court
below
largely
based
its
judgment
and
mr.
louis
bronstein
who
was
here
handled
the
case
for
the
government
in
the
lower
court
and
handled
it
in
a
various
statesmen's
like
fashion.
he
is
a
very
able
and
tough
adversary.
the
court
urged
the
parties
to
try
to
get
together
on
stipulations
instead
of
taking
the
court's
time
with
a
lot
of
miscellaneous
testimony
and
exhibits
and
after
mr.
bronstein
had
deposed
34
representatives
of
the
defendants,
they
proceeded
to
the
stipulation
table
and
after
some
months
there,
the
stipulations
which
are
in
this
record
were
arrived
at
and
i
submit
that
its
not
an
occasion
for
looking
in
to
little
fragments
of
the
deposition
as
mr.
zimmerman
did
in
one
reference
this
morning
in
saying
“well,
look
at
this,
here
the
government
has
stipulated
the
facts,
the
basic
facts,
the
broad
sweep
of
facts
and
i
submit
there's
no
occasion
for
the
court
to
have
to
revert
to
these
depositions
but
if
you
do,
you
find
as
in
most
other
depositions
or
testimony
of
34
witnesses
that
some
say
one
thing
and
some
say
another
and
its
out
of
the
total
of
this
that
this
stipulation
was
arrived
at.”
and
you
can
find
a
little
fragment
here,
a
little
fragment
there
that
will
support
almost
anything
but
you
can't
find
any
that
will
show
that
there
was
any
agreement
on
price
or
that
anybody
was
constrained
as
to
what
price
he
should
charge,
he
didn't
have
full
freedom
of
action
and
that
i
submit
is
the
key
to
it.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
i
have
no
doubt
it
would
be
pointed
to
as
some
evidence
of
that
but
you
barely
need
to
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
mr.
zimmerman
if
i
understood
him
said,
if
you
assume
the
effects,
you
can
establish
the
restraint
and
that's
the
government's
case.
they
assume
without
any
proof
that
it
has
have
this
effect
upon
competition
and
upon
that
assumption
they
say
there
was
a
combination
and
restraint
of
trade.
the
trouble
with
that
is
there's
no
such
proof
and
so
it's
only
a
matter
of
assumption.
now,
just
on
the
fact
--
factor
stipulation,
one
other
thing
which
i
think
is
significant.
the
stipulations
were
arrived
at
after
the
government
had
a
grand
jury
investigation
which
did
not
result
in
an
indictment
when
they
called
many
witnesses,
when
they
gotten
thousands
of
documents
and
we
supply,
the
defendants
supplied
the
list
of
10,000
costumers
and
they
apparently
found
no
costumer
who
complained
about
this
practice
because
no
costumer
was
ever
called
and
there's
no
testimony
or
stipulation
showing
what
a
costumer
would
testify
on
this
subject
and
i
submit
that
the
case
is
not
a
proper
one
for
the
court
to
go
behind
the
stipulations
and
as
if
the
parties
had
made
different
stipulations.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes,
and
if
your
honor
will
look
in
volume
one
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
that
the
agreed
findings
begin
at
page
55
and
run
on
for
150
pages
and
those
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
those
are
the
findings
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
where
the
indication
in
the
margin
as
to
whether
they
were
agreed
or
not
agreed
and
those,
the
agreed
findings
are
the
basis
for
the
trial
court's
findings
and
those
agreed
findings
in
turn
were
based
upon
the
underlying
stipulation
which
is
also
in
this
record,
the
several
stipulations.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes.
where
there
were
--
if
your
honor
will
look
at
that
agreed
set
of
findings,
you
will
see
some
matters
which
are
underlined.
where
the
parties
did
not
agree
and
there
in
some
cases,
the
court
basing
his
conclusion
on
the
stipulation
or
documents
of
record
made
independent
findings
but
the
critical
findings,
the
dispositive
findings
here
stem
from
the
stipulation
and
the
agreement
i
think.
now,
--
if
your
honors
will
look
at
the
sweep
of
those
agreed
findings
and
the
sweep
of
the
practice
of
price
competition
and
the
need
for
this
information
and
how
it
was
used,
you'll
see
one
other
thing
which
i
ought
to
mention
at
this
stage.
if
a
supplier
had
supplied
the
costumer
before
he
could
find
out
the
price
of
course
by
looking
at
his
own
records,
the
price
he
charged.
now,
one
did
not
always
adhere
to
the
same
price
and
he
couldn't
rely
on
the
fact
that
another
supplier
would
adhere
to
the
same
price
because
it's
also
stipulated
that
if
there
were
changes
in
cost
or
changes
in
supply
or
changes
in
specifications,
those
prices
would
not
be
adhered
to.
so
you
cannot
take
it
just
because
the
price
was
charged
once
that
it
will
still
be
the
charge
--
the
same
charge.
after
the
costumer
or
after
the
records
of
the
supplier
as
a
source,
the
supplier
would
then
ask
the
costumer
and
the
costumer
would
supply
information,
sometimes
information
which
the
supplier
doubted
but
usually
supplied
information.
now,
the
important
part
of
this
is
that
it
didn't
make
the
slightest
difference
where
the
information
was
obtained
as
to
how
the
seller
who
got
the
information
behaved.
he
behaved
in
exactly
the
same
way
in
seeking
further
business,
whether
he
got
the
information
from
his
records
or
from
a
costumer
or
from
a
competitor
and
therefore
to
say
that
any
of
the
alleged
defects
stem
from
this
exchange
of
price
information
seems
to
me
to
be
without
foundation.
now,
i'm
going
to
push
on
here
and
say
only
that
as
we've
said
in
our
brief,
it
--
i
think
the
government's
statement
of
the
questions
really
rather
elides
the
fact
that
so
much
of
this
record
was
stipulated
and
basis
it
rather
on
some
fragments
here
and
there.
i
said
before
recess
that
it
really
were
there
was
a
common
denominator
here
of
the
practice
which
was
challenged,
which
was
the
practice
of
getting
information
by
a
telephone
and
then
supplying
it
in
due
course
when
it
was
asked
for
on
a
wholly
different
transaction.
mr.
zimmerman
said
this
morning
that
in
some
cases,
people
gave
not
only
past
transaction
information
but
current
code
information.
now,
its
clear
from
the
findings
that
only
a
part
of
all
the
defendants
ever
supplied
the
code
information
but
the
case
was
tried
on
the
assumption
that
it
was
the
common
denominator
information
that
was
the
thing
that
bound
all
these
defendants
together
and
therefore
i
submit
that
there's
no
occasion
to
explore
separately
the
few
cases
where
there
was
quotation
information
supplied.
if
that
made
a
difference,
the
court
would
have
to
dispose
of
the
case
by
dismissing
as
to
some
and
not
as
to
others
and
what
the
government
was
trying
to
do
as
it
just
trying
to
do
here
is
to
hold
all
the
defendants
together
on
the
exchange
of
information
about
past
transactions.
the
fact
that
some
defendants
might
have
interpreted
that
phrase
differently,
i
think
does
not
affect
the
basic
legal
position.
now,
on
the
question
of
combination,
i
won't
take
any
real
time
on
that.
i
must
say
that
the
cases
don't
clarify
entirely
what
is
a
combination
and
what
is
a
conspiracy
or
an
agreement.
here,
what
happened
was
that
a
supplier
would
call
up
another
supplier
and
ask
for
some
information.
knowing
that
in
due
course
that
supplier
might
expect
to
have
the
courtesy
reciprocated
not
in
connection
with
that
transaction
but
in
connection
with
the
wholly
different
transaction
and
that's
all
there
is
in
the
way
of
consensual
basis
for
whatever
this
--
whatever
you
want
to
call
this.
each
supplier
had
sometime
asked
and
then
as
a
matter
of
reciprocal
courtesy
at
some
other
time
supplied
some
information.
sometimes
a
few
request,
sometimes
more
request
and
so
you
have
a
sort
of
a
situation
of
reciprocal
commercial
courtesy
at
work.
now,
the
government
says
that's
enough
to
make
it
a
combination.
it
seems
to
me
not
to
fit
any
of
the
existing
authorities
on
that
subject
but
it
isn't
vital
because
if
it
was
a
combination,
it
was
not
a
combination
to
restrain
trade
because
it
did
not
result
in
restraining
in
any
degree
the
price
which
any
supplier
would
get
for
his
product.
it
did
neither
coerce
nor
restrained
and
so
however
you
break
it
down.
if
you
say
it
was
a
combination,
it
was
not
a
combination
in
restraint
of
trade.
my
own
view
is
that
the
district
court
was
quite
right
on
this
record
in
concluding
that
this
was
sort
of
like
the
mutual
courtesies
which
we
all
do
each
other
and
which
cannot
be
regarded
as
a
combination
just
because
we
expect
when
we
give
him.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
think
not,
but
there
are
small
suppliers
in
the
group.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
no,
nothing
of
a
kind.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
it's
absolutely
neutral
on
that
subject.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
may
i
at
this
time
ask
those
of
your
honors
who
want
to
look
at
charter
two,
look
at
volume
three
which
contains
significant
information.
the
government
put
in
no
proof
about
the
course
of
price
history
and
the
defendant's
confronted
with
this
kind
of
a
record
did
their
best
and
these
charts
in
volume
three
show
it.
now,
the
first
chart
in
volume
three
shows
how
prices
of
everything
else
was
going
up
while
the
prices
of
containers
were
coming
down,
a
practice
which
result
which
one
would
not
expect
if
there
was
any
kind
of
a
price
conspiracy
or
price
fixing
arrangement
however
tenuous.
the
next
group
of
charts
shows
how
the
prices
varied
between
the
defendant's
plants
and
shows
that
there
was
absolutely
no
uniformity
of
price
as
between
the
defendants
or
within
plants.
the
next
group
of
charts
which
is
a
very
significant
group
which
begins
about
the
middle
or
begins
on
page
21,
shows
the
business
gained
and
lost
by
these
defendants
and
it
shows
on
page
22
for
example,
in
those
columns
that
each
of
this
companies
in
every
year
gain
some
business
and
lost
some
business
to
competitors.
and
for
example
in
this
chart
on
page
22,
the
container
corporation
which
is
my
plant
in
the
year
1960
did
business
with
about
a
third
of
--
about
of
third
of
its
costumers
were
people
with
whom
it
had
not
done
any
business
the
year
before
and
about
a
third
where
people
with
whom
it
didn't
do
any
business
the
year
following.
now,
it's
found
and
stipulated
that
generally
speaking,
costumers
change
suppliers
only
when
they
got
a
cut
in
price
and
therefore
it's
reasonable
to
infer
that
all
this
changes
were
results
of
the
price
competition
in
the
industry
and
the
fact
that
there
was
widespread
price
cutting.
now
beyond
that,
the
next
group
of
charts
shows
how
the
price
went
in
almost
--
almost
like
a
seismograph
during
a
convulsion
and
the
prices
went
like
this
as
between
companies
and
as
between
plants
and
because
of
the
difficulty
of
getting
more
than
five
lines
on
a
single
chart,
that
these
are
rather
grouped
geographically
as
plants
of
various
competitors
but
your
honors
will
see
as
you
look
through
this
that
the
price
was
all
over
the
place
and
was
all
over
the
places
between
plants
and
as
between
defendants.
and
then
going
on,
there's
another
series
of
charts
stored
at
the
back
of
the
volume
which
shows
that
there
was
a
great
variation
from
so-called
manuals.
now,
each
company
had
a
manual
which
views
to
compute
price
although
they
were
rarely
if
ever
published
and
their
manual
was
departed
from
as
shown
here
both
up
and
down,
usually
down
for
manual.
so,
nobody
who
knew
what
anybody
else's
manual
is
could
surely
compute
the
price.
and
then
finally,
there's
another
group
of
charts
in
that
same
part
of
the
volume
which
show
departure
from
board
prices
which
is
another
possible
way
of
computing
the
price.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
think
that's
--
i
think
that's
perfectly
evident.
what
they're
saying
is,
were
entitled
to
bar
this
access
to
knowledge
among
competitors
who
must
there
after
compete
in
ignorance
because
we
say
the
effect
might
be
to
somehow
chill
price
competition.
when
there's
no
proof
of
that,
the
proof
is
of
the
most
active
kind
of
price
competition,
the
most
destructive
kind
because
it
takes
costumers
away
in
large
numbers
year
to
year,
and
that
in
my
view
is
exactly
what
the
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes
sir.
that
concession
was
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
the
--
i
think
the
governments
position
in
the
lower
court
was
if
they
just
charge
exchange
“a
price
information”
they
would
have
no
case.
they
went
beyond
that
and
charge
the
effective
price
information
but
they
didn't
prove
any
such
effect.
they
relied
as
to
its
effect
on
what
they
said
was
the
natural
effect
of
the
exchange.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
think
what
the
court
is
saying
really
is
that
you
have
to
have
a
combination
which
restraints
trade
and
if
there
was
a
combination,
it
didn't
show
any
restraint
of
trade.
and
what
do
you
say
its
one
agreement
or
two
agreements
doesn't
make
much
difference.
the
fact
is
that
they
did
not
prove
any
such
restraint,
the
record
shows
the
contrary
and
now,
let
me
push
on
very
rapidly
just
to
touch
on
the
couple
of
other
points.
the
government
relies
here
on
the
cases
decided
before
maple
flooring,
american
column
and
linseed
oil
and
the
sugar
institute
case
decided
after
maple
flooring
and
says
these,
this
arrangement
was
or
this
combination
was
invalid
under
those
cases.
now,
i
won't
take
your
honors
time
to
try
to
describe
those
cases
but
your
honors
will
recall
that
they
were
very
tight
and
explicit
arrangements
by
which
in
every
case,
information
about
prices
was
supplied,
there
was
per
leasing
of
the
price
structure.
in
the
column
case,
the
prices
went
up
over
a
300%
as
a
result
of
the
arrangement.
in
the
other
case,
they
were
stabilized.
there
were
fines
and
forfeitures
in
the
linseed
oil
case
for
any
departure
and
there's
nothing
of
that
kind
here
and
maple
flooring
i
submit
lays
down
the
principle
that
knowledge
which
invokes
the
self
interest
of
sellers
and
lets
the
sellers
use
the
knowledge
to
compete
in
any
way
that
suits
there
situation
which
is
the
situation
here
clearly
permits.
the
kind
of
information
that
was
supplied
here
and
that
was
recognized
when
the
consent
decree
was
made
and
largely
in
reliance
on
the
maple
flooring
case
but
my
friend
says,
“well,
in
maple
flooring,
they
didn't
have
any
information
about
particular
costumers.”
but
they
did
in
the
cement
institute
case
and
the
cement
institute
case,
information
was
supplied
about
particular
costumers
because
of
the
fact
that
in
that
case,
it
was
the
practice
to
order
cement
from
a
lot
of
different
suppliers
in
order
to
get
a
lower
price
even
if
you
weren't
going
to
use
it
and
that
was
kind
of
a
commercial
fraud
and
the
information
about
that
could
be
exchanged.
i
don't
say
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes,
sir.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
it
was
a
broad
--
it
was
broad
price
fixing
charge
which
included
references
to
an
earlier
trade
association,
one
not
involved
here
and
the
one
involved
here
is
not
charged
at
all
and
the
injunction
provisions
and
the
consent
decree
bar
the
kind
of
trade
association
activity
which
were
involved
in
the
earlier
case.
but
they
exempt
the
exchange
or
dissemination
of
information
about
past
transactions
and
it
stipulated
and
found
that
every
defendant
relied
upon
the
provisions
of
that
consent
decree
and
doing
the
business
this
way.
and
i
submit
that
of
course
the
consent
decree
is
not
binding
on
your
honors
but
at
some
precedent
for
the
fact
that
the
government
has
recognized
for
a
long,
long
time
that
this
practice
does
not
have
the
pernicious
effects
alleged
now
and
if
this
practice
elsewhere
does
have
such
pernicious
effects
so
that
your
honors
can
be
asked
to
extend
again
the
area
of
first
day
violation,
it
ought
to
be
approved
and
ought
not
to
be
assumed
just
on
the
basis
of
speculation.
