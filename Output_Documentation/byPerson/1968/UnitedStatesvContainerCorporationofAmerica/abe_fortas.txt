justice
abe
fortas
well,
maybe
by
this
time
mr.
zimmerman
it
would
be
a
good
idea
for
you
to
tell
us
precisely
what
it
is
that
you're
complaining.
i
got
all
of
these
saying
you're
not
complaining
out
of
it,
it
makes
me
feel
pretty
comfortable.
now,
what
is
it
that
you
don't
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
i
had
an
understanding
was
with
the
case
for
the
--
been
wrong,
were
there
meetings
here
of
these
people?
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
so
then
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
maybe
it
doesn't,
maybe
it
does,
but
there
were
--
you
say
mostly
it
was
matter
of
telephone
--
justice
abe
fortas
occasionally,
there
were
meetings.
justice
abe
fortas
and
were
these
meetings
under
the
hospices
of
the
trade
association
or
pursuant
to
agreement
or
how
do
they
--
what
are
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
your
complaint
is,
so
that
these
meetings
are
in
this
telephone
conversations.
justice
abe
fortas
one
competitor
or
one
member
of
the
industry
would
tell
another
what
it
had
charged
--
justice
abe
fortas
a
particular
customer?
justice
abe
fortas
what
does
that
mean?
what
has
been
your
price?
justice
abe
fortas
did
this
go
beyond
the
1940
consent
decree?
justice
abe
fortas
if
that
decree
didn't
permit,
or
was
it
seven
of
the
defendant
--
no,
nine
of
the
defendants
here?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
to
the
extent
that
it
did
that
you're
charging
communication
of
the
most
recent
price.
justice
abe
fortas
then
you're
charging
them
with
doing
something
that
was
expressly
permitted
by
the
consent
decree,
this
particular
defendant,
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
if
i
say.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
consent
decree
does
something,
doesn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well
at
some
point,
get
a
--
here,
you're
saying
that
they
did
something
beyond
--
justice
abe
fortas
maple
flooring,
something
beyond
the
exchange
of
information.
justice
abe
fortas
you're
saying
that
they
did
something
beyond
that?
justice
abe
fortas
but
it
did
not
--
it
did
accord
the
fine.
justice
abe
fortas
as
to
what
they
were
going
to
charge
--
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt
you
again,
but
would
you
tell
us
just
what
information
if
any
as
to
price.
do
you
believe
that
these
companies
could
lawfully
exchange
and
what
information
they
could
not
and
as
to
the
exchange
of
which
you
are
here
complaining?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
understand
that,
what
does
that
mean?
is
that
the
past
prices?
justice
abe
fortas
in
average
prices?
justice
abe
fortas
can
you
distinguish
between
that
and
prices
to
individual
customers
inside
the
port?
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
you
said
there
was
no
--
you
weren't
charging
an
agreement
here.
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
you
said
deduce
from
a
course
of
conduct
rather
than
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that,
but
are
you
charging
an
agreement
or
course
of
conduct?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
--
and
the
--
and
what
you
object
to
is
that
these
prices
were
prices
to
individual
customers
and
individualized
transaction.
justice
abe
fortas
and
were
current
instead
of
say
ten
days
old?
justice
abe
fortas
that
would
apply
to
everything,
that
apply
to
all
over
our
economy
wouldn't
it
mr.
seymour,
that
they
need
that
price
information
about
the
competitors
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
seymour,
i
suppose
that
if
there
were
price
uniformity
or
price
stability
in
this
industry,
that
the
effect
of
the
exchange
of
price
information
would
be
some
evidence
of
a
combination,
conventional
antitrust
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
it
could
be
--
and
could
be
relied
on
to
some
evidence
of
that.
now,
the
government
admits
that
there's
no
as
i
understand
it
that
there's
no
indication
of
price
stability
here.
what
they
say
as
i
get
it
is
that
there
would
have
been
more
vigorous
competition
than
if
there
had
not
been
this
exchange
of
information,
is
that
your
understanding
of
the
theory?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
seymour,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
on
the
price
history
in
the
industry?
is
there
a
tendency
for
prices
to
be
uniform
or
the
cluster?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
beginning
to
think
that
perhaps
what
the
government
is
seeking
is
a
perceived
rule
with
respect
not
to
price
fixing
but
with
respect
to
a
“combination”
to
exchange
current
prices
information.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
zimmerman,
may
i
take
advantage
of
this
to
ask
you
whether
you
agree
that
the
government
is
seeking
a
per
se
rule
here?
that
is
to
say
that
it's
per
se
violation
of
antitrust
laws
once
you
have
proved
that
there
is
a
combination
among
the
defendants
to
exchange
current
price
information
as
to
individual
costumers.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
that
so.
justice
abe
fortas
without
any
proof
as
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
the
effect.
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
but
no
proof
--
you
don't
claim
that
you
got
any
proof
in
this
record
as
to
specific
effect
on
price
in
the
market?
