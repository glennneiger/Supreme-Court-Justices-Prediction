justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
just
before
you
started
--
just
straighten
me
out.
what's
the
difference
between
cost
and
revenue?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
fully
distributed?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
excludes
any
need
for
profit?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
fully
distributed?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
what
would
the
revenue
need?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
investments?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
railroads
need
revenues
except
to
pay
its
loss
for
the
return.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
what,
for
example?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
does?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
does?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
it
needed
for?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
anyway,
this
was
the
purported
justification
of
distinguishing
between
intercity
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
commuter
service.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
south
i
gather
does
not
have
the
commuter
problem
as
northern
line?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
trienens,
do
you
on
your
side
of
the
case,
question
the
principle
that
if
were
so
that
the
cost
of
the
northern
road
in
handling
this
class
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
was
(inaudible)
and
the
southern
(inaudible)
can
make
this
kind
of
effect.
do
you
question
the
division
based
on
profit?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
--
you
don't
really
deny
the
fact
that
on
some
segments
of
this
traffic
--
of
their
traffic
in
northern
roads
have
higher
cost.
justice
byron
r.
white
like
for
example
car
cost,
on
segments
of
traffic
they
really
do
have
the
substantially
higher
car
cost.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
point
is
that
--
no?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
said
on
some
segments
of
their
traffic.
and
your
point
is
that
you
ought
to
look
at
this
north-south
traffic
to
determine
car
cost.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
maybe
to
between
new
york
and
buffalo
carrying
some
kind
of
the
traffic
car
cost
or
two
or
three
times
this
high?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
point
is
that
that
cost
shouldn't
be
used
major
north-south
traffic
cost.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
see
the
way
this
works
out
probably
if
they
get
a
dollar
you
just
get
$0.50,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
and
under
this
order,
what
is
it?
something
like
58-42
or
something,
58
or?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
get
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
suppose
the
same
finding
why
the
commission
looks
for
the
increased
rate
with
an
increased
joint
rate?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
that's
normal
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
the
cost
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
thought,
for
example
and
said
“right,
we
are
thinking
it
has
to
do
this.”
justice
byron
r.
white
how
it
represents
--
certainly
some
of
the
part
of
the
revenue
needs
that
the
--
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
just
about
a
generalization
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
trienens,
didn't
the
commission
say
that
even
if
there
are
a
lot
of
cost
in
the
commuter
service
that
are
not
common
but
solely
related
to
commuter
service,
nevertheless
they
should
be
included
and
allocated?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
they
also
conceded
there
were
some
solely
related
costs?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
nevertheless
included
them.
