justice

it

is
being

odd
that

relatively
small
factor

was

anything

that's
what
i've
been

justice
abe
fortas
i
know,
but
that's
not
quite
pinpointed
to
the
problem
that
i
have
in

is
it?
well,
i
think
you're
going
to
get
to
the
commuter
problem.
justice
abe
fortas
and
to
my
mind,
that
perhaps
most
vividly
presents
the
issue
that
has
troubled
me.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
really
cuts
very
deep
doesn't
it?
would
you
apply
that
principle
to
all
problems
under
the
act?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
suppose
you
had
a
particular
plain
ascertainment
cost
of
kind
particular
types
of
commodities,
you
do
that
don't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
most
to
those
cost
are
a
part
of
a
joint
cost
that
involved
many
other
operations.
but
somehow
rather
by
the
wizardry
of
accounting
techniques
we
do
disentangle
them
and
do
make
the
segregation.
i'm
not
saying
that
it
always
makes
sense
and
to
do
that
or
it's
always
worthwhile
if
that's
a
duty
that
always
should
be
imposed
on
the
icc.
but
certainly,
you
do
it
in
some
instances
for
some
purposes.
and
what
i
have
not
got
clear
in
my
mind
is,
what
are
the
special
reasons
here
why
you
did
not
do
it?
particularly
in
view
of
the
relatively
small
amount
of
the
overall
cost
or
an
overall
traffic
represented
by
the
north-south
traffic
and
especially
on
the
northern
roads?
that's
what
i
haven't
heard
yet
or
read,
so
far
as
i
recall.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it's
distinguishable.
it's
got
a
different
point
of
origin,
different
point
of
destination.
it's
north-south
through
traffic
and
i
don't
suppose
you're
going
to
say
that
it
would
be
impossible
or
even
impractical
as
a
matter
of
accountancy
to
breakout
cost
for
that
segment
of
the
traffic.
you
wouldn't
say
that,
would
you?
justice
abe
fortas
i
just
think
that'd
be
a
very
sensible
way
of
going
about
it.
justice
abe
fortas
but
you
did
not
break
it
down.
what
you
relied
on
was
rail
form
a
aggregate
cost
as
i
understand
it
without
making
any
segregation
whatever.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
a
further
or
refinement
beyond
that
would
be
possible,
would
it
not?
for
example,
don't
we
have
--
isn't
it
necessary
to
decide
here
whether
it
was
or
was
not
appropriate
just
to
take
an
illustration
to
use
these
commuter
costs?
now,
i
understand
you're
--
i
think
i
understand
the
commission's
reason
for
it.
the
commission
says
that
there
are
no
separate
facilities
that
are
used
for
the
commuter-passenger
traffic.
and
therefore,
the
commission
says
“we
did
not
break
out
those
cost
and
eliminate
them
for
this
particular
purpose.”
but
that
presents
a
problem.
wouldn't
you
agree
that
that
presents
a
problem
of
standards?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know,
but
you
get
the
question
of
should
it.
justice
abe
fortas
of
course
you
did,
but
should
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i'm
not
going
to
pursue
any
further
beyond
suggesting
to
you
that
basic
problem
here
is
as
i
understand
it,
arises
from
the
fact
that
the
commission
said,
“we're
going
to
make
the
--
we're
going
to
review
these
divisions
on
the
basis
of
comparative
cost.”
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
not
of
the
factors
cost,
not
what
the
railroad's
need,
but
cost.
then,
the
commission
i
should
think
would
have
a
duty
if
any
standards
are
to
be
applicable
here
to
show
that
it
has
--
and
reasonable
limits
applied
cost
standards.
namely
that
it
has
ascertained
cost
on
some
proper
sensible
basis.
i'm
very
much
in
favor
of
latitude
to
the
icc
and
this
--
its
terrible
jobs
as
i
have
expressed
in
various
times,
but
they
have
to
be
some
standards
here.
and
instead
of
that,
what
the
icc
did
here
was
to
take
a
gross
figure,
cost
of
a
total
operations,
including
some
rather
elements
that
offhand,
there
of
surprising,
such
as
computed
charges
and
the
unsegregated
kind
charges
or
whatever
that
item
is.
and
--
then
you
have
arrived
at
your
conclusion
on
that
basis
and
that's
what's
bothers
some
here,
and
it's
not
because
you
could
not
make
a
further
refinement
of
these
costs,
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
but
governor,
what
percentage
of
the
total
revenues
of
the
southern
railroads
are
we
talking
about
here?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i
mean
overall?
what's
the
--
how
much
of
their
revenues,
what
percentage
of
their
total
revenues
to
the
southern
roads
does
the
southern
division
derive
from
these
does--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
southern
roads
derive
from
the
division
then?
justice
abe
fortas
20%
from
all
of
their
revenues?
justice
abe
fortas
now
the
next
thing
i
want
to
ask
you
is
this.
as
i
understand
it,
what
you're
seeking
is
an
affirmance
of
the
district
court
order?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
question
before
us
is
whether
we'll
affirm
the
district
court
order
not
whether
we
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
like
what's
happening
or
we
don't
like
it.
justice
abe
fortas
well
provided
it
comes
out
right.
justice
abe
fortas
well
may
i
interrupt
you
there
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
if
you
don't
mind?
in
fixing
freight
rates,
the
commission
does
take
into
account
deficits
on
passenger
service,
am
i
right
on
that?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
no.
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
just
in
fixing
freight
rate.
freight
rates,
does
the
commission
take
into
account
deficits
on
passenger
service?
justice
abe
fortas
pardon,
go
ahead
and
finish
that
sentence
then.
justice
abe
fortas
the
answer
to
my
answer
to
my
question
yes?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
say
there
are
commission
rulings
to
the
effect
that
commuter
service
will
--
deficits
on
commuter
service
as
distinguished
from
passengers
other
intercity
passenger
service,
will
not
be
considered.
justice
abe
fortas
in
fixing
freight
rates?
justice
abe
fortas
but
here,
your
point
is
that
they
have
considered
deficits
on
commuter
service
in
fixing
these
divisions?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you're
saying
that
they
have
not
used
--
let
me
see
if
i
can
be
precise
about
this.
if
i
correctly
understand
your
last
statement,
you're
telling
us
that
the
commission
has
not
used
the
cost
of
passenger
service,
intercity
passenger
service,
except
for
the
cost
of
common
facilities
for
the
purpose
of
arriving
at
the
cost
for
purposes
of
fixing
freight
rates?
justice
abe
fortas
let
me
hear
you
state
it.
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
that
as
to
this
case.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
as
to
this
case.
i'm
asking
you
generally,
when
the
commission
figures
cost
for
purposes
of
a
freight
rate
case,
not
a
division
case,
a
freight
rate
case.
does
the
commission
take
into
account
the
cost
of
passenger
service
or
does
it
not?
justice
abe
fortas
how
old
is
the
cost
material
in
this
record?
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
suppose
if
this
case
goes
back,
the
whole
thing
left
be
done
over
again,
won't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
this
case
was
in
the
commission
nine
years?
justice
abe
fortas
six
years,
and
then
in
the
courts
since
then?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
they
say
the
whole
proceeding
would've
been
over
if
you
haven't
decided
before
the
court.
justice
abe
fortas
so,
your
direct
answer
is
somewhere
between
five
minutes
and
15
years,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
didn't
quite
it,
is
it?
because
commission's
made
a
finding
that
the
existing
divisions
are
not
fair
and
reasonable.
and
that
finding
is
not
being
presented
for
decision
here.
the
district
court
didn't
make
a
judgment
on
it
as
i
read
it,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
the
district
court
said
the
commission's
result
was
an
error
in
making
these
adjustments.
it
did
not
find
that
the
existing
divisions
were
fair
and
reasonable,
did
it?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
so
that
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
parties
here,
the
northern
roads
or
whoever
wants
to
do
it
has
a
right
to
obtain
a
commission
determination
as
to
what
adjustments
would
be
necessary
to
make
the
rates
fair
and
reasonable.
so
that
if
the
decision
of
the
icc
is
set
aside
here,
it
will
necessarily
follow,
will
it
not,
that
there'll
have
to
be
further
commission
proceedings.
and
that
those
proceedings
will
be
on
the
track
record
will
be
quite
lengthy,
it's
just
a
fact
of
life.
justice
abe
fortas
well
the
same
thing
is
true
of
intercity
passenger
cars,
isn't
it?
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
isn't
that
southern
roads
have
cery
large
cost
for
intercity
passenger
servicing
and
deficits.
and
the
northern
roads
have
great
cost
and
deficits
with
respect
to
commuter
service.
and
the
impact
of
those
two
things
held
very
differently.
but
if
you're
going
to
talk
about
segregating
common
cost
and
then
making
an
allocation,
are
you
really
arguing
for
a
difference
between
passenger
cost
on
the
one
hand
and
commuter
cost
on
the
other
hand,
or
are
you
--
how
can
you
do
that?
except
on
the
basis
that
it's
better
for
the
south
to
do
it
on
that
basis,
but
logically
you
can't
argue
that
way,
can
you?
justice
abe
fortas
don't
you
have
to
say
that
the
right
thing
to
do
to
make
your
argument,
right
thing
to
do
is
to
take
your
common
cost
as
between
passenger
or
commuter
and
--
on
the
one
hand,
and
freight
on
the
other
hand
and
then
allocate
it.
justice
abe
fortas
and
as
between
freight
on
the
one
hand
and
passenger
plus
commuter
on
the
other
hand.
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me
sir.
this
is
what
bothered
me.
it's
on
page
31
in
your
brief.
this
is
what
i
recall.
you
say
it
is
generally
agreed
that
the
intercity
passenger
deficits
must
be
considered
as
part
of
the
cost
of
providing
freight
service.
for
such
deficits
are
usually
the
result
of
cost
allocated
in
the
passenger
operations
from
common
facilities,
which
must
be
maintained
in
order
to
provide
freight
service.
justice
abe
fortas
suburban
passenger
deficits
however,
required
another
matter.
now
do
i
understand
what
you
have
just
said
in
the
colloquy
with
me
to
supersede
this
statement
and
that
you
do
agree
that
the
solely
--
that
the
cost
solely
allocable
to
passenger
--
intercity
passenger
operations
on
the
one
hand
and
to
commuter
operations
on
the
other
hand,
should
be
treated
the
same
way
and
they
should
both
be
eliminated?
justice
abe
fortas
well
i
haven't
checked
the
testimony.
i'm
checking
what
you
said
in
your
brief.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
do
the
northern
roads
and
the
southern
roads
devote
the
same
percentage
of
their
cars
and
their
property
and
so
on
to
the
north-south
traffic?

there
are
no
separate
facilities
that
are
used
for
the
commuter-passenger
traffic.
and
therefore,
the
commission
says
“we
did
not
break
out
those
cost
and
eliminate
them
for
this
particular
purpose.”
but
that
presents
a
problem.
wouldn't
you
agree
that
that
presents
a
problem
of
standards?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know,
but
you
get
the
question
of
should
it.
justice
abe
fortas
of
course
you
did,
but
should
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i'm
not
going
to
pursue
any
further
beyond
suggesting
to
you
that
basic
problem
here
is
as
i
understand
it,
arises
from
the
fact
that
the
commission
said,
“we're
going
to
make
the
--
we're
going
to
review
these
divisions
on
the
basis
of
comparative
cost.”
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
not
of
the
factors
cost,
not
what
the
railroad's
need,
but
cost.
then,
the
commission
i
should
think
would
have
a
duty
if
any
standards
are
to
be
applicable
here
to
show
that
it
has
--
and
reasonable
limits
applied
cost
standards.
namely
that
it
has
ascertained
cost
on
some
proper
sensible
basis.
i'm
very
much
in
favor
of
latitude
to
the
icc
and
this
--
its
terrible
jobs
as
i
have
expressed
in
various
times,
but
they
have
to
be
some
standards
here.
and
instead
of
that,
what
the
icc
did
here
was
to
take
a
gross
figure,
cost
of
a
total
operations,
including
some
rather
elements
that
offhand,
there
of
surprising,
such
as
computed
charges
and
the
unsegregated
kind
charges
or
whatever
that
item
is.
and
--
then
you
have
arrived
at
your
conclusion
on
that
basis
and
that's
what's
bothers
some
here,
and
it's
not
because
you
could
not
make
a
further
refinement
of
these
costs,
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
but
governor,
what
percentage
of
the
total
revenues
of
the
southern
railroads
are
we
talking
about
here?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i
mean
overall?
what's
the
--
how
much
of
their
revenues,
what
percentage
of
their
total
revenues
to
the
southern
roads
does
the
southern
division
derive
from
these
does--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
southern
roads
derive
from
the
division
then?
justice
abe
fortas
20%
from
all
of
their
revenues?
justice
abe
fortas
now
the
next
thing
i
want
to
ask
you
is
this.
as
i
understand
it,
what
you're
seeking
is
an
affirmance
of
the
district
court
order?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
question
before
us
is
whether
we'll
affirm
the
district
court
order
not
whether
we
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
like
what's
happening
or
we
don't
like
it.
justice
abe
fortas
well
provided
it
comes
out
right.
justice
abe
fortas
well
may
i
interrupt
you
there
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
if
you
don't
mind?
in
fixing
freight
rates,
the
commission
does
take
into
account
deficits
on
passenger
service,
am
i
right
on
that?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
no.
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
just
in
fixing
freight
rate.
freight
rates,
does
the
commission
take
into
account
deficits
on
passenger
service?
justice
abe
fortas
pardon,
go
ahead
and
finish
that
sentence
then.
justice
abe
fortas
the
answer
to
my
answer
to
my
question
yes?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
say
there
are
commission
rulings
to
the
effect
that
commuter
service
will
--
deficits
on
commuter
service
as
distinguished
from
passengers
other
intercity
passenger
service,
will
not
be
considered.
justice
abe
fortas
in
fixing
freight
rates?
justice
abe
fortas
but
here,
your
point
is
that
they
have
considered
deficits
on
commuter
service
in
fixing
these
divisions?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you're
saying
that
they
have
not
used
--
let
me
see
if
i
can
be
precise
about
this.
if
i
correctly
understand
your
last
statement,
you're
telling
us
that
the
commission
has
not
used
the
cost
of
passenger
service,
intercity
passenger
service,
except
for
the
cost
of
common
facilities
for
the
purpose
of
arriving
at
the
cost
for
purposes
of
fixing
freight
rates?
justice
abe
fortas
let
me
hear
you
state
it.
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
that
as
to
this
case.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
as
to
this
case.
i'm
asking
you
generally,
when
the
commission
figures
cost
for
purposes
of
a
freight
rate
case,
not
a
division
case,
a
freight
rate
case.
does
the
commission
take
into
account
the
cost
of
passenger
service
or
does
it
not?
justice
abe
fortas
how
old
is
the
cost
material
in
this
record?
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
suppose
if
this
case
goes
back,
the
whole
thing
left
be
done
over
again,
won't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
this
case
was
in
the
commission
nine
years?
justice
abe
fortas
six
years,
and
then
in
the
courts
since
then?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
they
say
the
whole
proceeding
would've
been
over
if
you
haven't
decided
before
the
court.
justice
abe
fortas
so,
your
direct
answer
is
somewhere
between
five
minutes
and
15
years,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
didn't
quite
it,
is
it?
because
commission's
made
a
finding
that
the
existing
divisions
are
not
fair
and
reasonable.
and
that
finding
is
not
being
presented
for
decision
here.
the
district
court
didn't
make
a
judgment
on
it
as
i
read
it,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
the
district
court
said
the
commission's
result
was
an
error
in
making
these
adjustments.
it
did
not
find
that
the
existing
divisions
were
fair
and
reasonable,
did
it?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
so
that
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
parties
here,
the
northern
roads
or
whoever
wants
to
do
it
has
a
right
to
obtain
a
commission
determination
as
to
what
adjustments
would
be
necessary
to
make
the
rates
fair
and
reasonable.
so
that
if
the
decision
of
the
icc
is
set
aside
here,
it
will
necessarily
follow,
will
it
not,
that
there'll
have
to
be
further
commission
proceedings.
and
that
those
proceedings
will
be
on
the
track
record
will
be
quite
lengthy,
it's
just
a
fact
of
life.
justice
abe
fortas
well
the
same
thing
is
true
of
intercity
passenger
cars,
isn't
it?
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
isn't
that
southern
roads
have
cery
large
cost
for
intercity
passenger
servicing
and
deficits.
and
the
northern
roads
have
great
cost
and
deficits
with
respect
to
commuter
service.
and
the
impact
of
those
two
things
held
very
differently.
but
if
you're
going
to
talk
about
segregating
common
cost
and
then
making
an
allocation,
are
you
really
arguing
for
a
difference
between
passenger
cost
on
the
one
hand
and
commuter
cost
on
the
other
hand,
or
are
you
--
how
can
you
do
that?
except
on
the
basis
that
it's
better
for
the
south
to
do
it
on
that
basis,
but
logically
you
can't
argue
that
way,
can
you?
justice
abe
fortas
don't
you
have
to
say
that
the
right
thing
to
do
to
make
your
argument,
right
thing
to
do
is
to
take
your
common
cost
as
between
passenger
or
commuter
and
--
on
the
one
hand,
and
freight
on
the
other
hand
and
then
allocate
it.
justice
abe
fortas
and
as
between
freight
on
the
one
hand
and
passenger
plus
commuter
on
the
other
hand.
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me
sir.
this
is
what
bothered
me.
it's
on
page
31
in
your
brief.
this
is
what
i
recall.
you
say
it
is
generally
agreed
that
the
intercity
passenger
deficits
must
be
considered
as
part
of
the
cost
of
providing
freight
service.
for
such
deficits
are
usually
the
result
of
cost
allocated
in
the
passenger
operations
from
common
facilities,
which
must
be
maintained
in
order
to
provide
freight
service.
justice
abe
fortas
suburban
passenger
deficits
however,
required
another
matter.
now
do
i
understand
what
you
have
just
said
in
the
colloquy
with
me
to
supersede
this
statement
and
that
you
do
agree
that
the
solely
--
that
the
cost
solely
allocable
to
passenger
--
intercity
passenger
operations
on
the
one
hand
and
to
commuter
operations
on
the
other
hand,
should
be
treated
the
same
way
and
they
should
both
be
eliminated?
justice
abe
fortas
well
i
haven't
checked
the
testimony.
i'm
checking
what
you
said
in
your
brief.
