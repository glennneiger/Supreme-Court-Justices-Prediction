mr.
edward
a.
kaier
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
decree
of
a
three-judge
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana
setting
aside
an
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
which
prescribe
the
joint
--
the
divisions
of
joint
rates
to
be
received
by
northern
and
southern
railroads
respectively
from
freight
traffic
moving
between
official
territory
and
southern
territory
in
both
directions.
official
territory
may
generally
be
described
as
that
part
as
the
northeastern
part
of
the
united
states
and
the
southern
territory
the
southeastern
part.
more
particularly,
official
territory
would
be
the
territory
east
to
the
mississippi
river
north
of
the
ohio
and
certain
cities
in
virginia
such
as
richmond.
southern
territory
is
east
of
the
mississippi
and
south
of
official
territory.
the
appellants
are
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
the
northern
railroads
and
the
appellees
are
the
southern
railroads
and
two
associations,
one
the
southern
governor's
conference
and
the
other
southeastern
association
of
railroad
and
utility
commissioners.
your
honors
will
recall
i
believe
that
a
joint
rate
is
one
which
applies
over
two
or
more
railroads
but
is
stated
in
a
single
sum.
the
divisions
in
issue
in
this
case
were
primary
divisions.
that
is
to
say
divisions
which
applied
to
and
from
the
certain
gateways
between
northern
and
southern
railroads
and
if
there
was
more
than
railroad
north
to
the
gateway
those
two
railroads
over
three
railroads
would
get
their
share
of
the
revenue
from
subdivisions
of
the
primary
division
and
likewise
south
of
the
gateways.
those
subdivisions
were
not
in
issue
in
this
case
only
the
primary
divisions.
the
railroad's
evidence
both
that
submitted
by
the
southern
lines
and
that's
submitted
by
the
northern
lines
was
on
a
group
basis
in
which
all
the
northern
lines
were
grouped
together
and
there
figures
submitted
by
on
the
group
basis
and
likewise
for
the
southern
lines.
and
it
was
decided
by
the
commission
on
a
group
basis
except
that
the
norfolk
southern
railroad
one
of
the
southern
group,
was
awarded
division
higher
than
that
granted
to
the
southern
lines
generally.
this
was
in
recognition
of
its
greater
revenue
needs
and
there
is
no
issue
about
that
before
the
court.
the
commission
is
empowered
by
paragraph
6
of
section
15
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
to
prescribe
just
and
reasonable
divisions
whenever
after
hearing
in
its
opinion
it
finds
that
the
existing
divisions
are
unjust
unreasonable
or
inequitable.
the
case
before
the
commission
was
one
that
was
originally
decided
in
1953.
before
that
decision,
the
divisional
factors
prescribed
for
southern
lines
were
generally
25%
higher
mile
per
mile
than
those
prescribed
for
northern
lines.
and
on
the
very
important
item
of
citrus
fruit
which
moves
in
great
larger
in
south
to
the
north,
the
--
an
earlier
case
had
fixed
the
divisions
as
high
as
85%
higher
than
the
northern
lines
factors.
now,
i
should
correct
that.
the
northern
lines
--
the
southern
lines
didn't
get
divisions
85%
higher
but
the
factors
which
go
into
make
that
were
85%
higher
so
that
the
southern
line
got
something
a
lesser
percentage
than
the
85%
but
very
substantially
more
than
the
northern
lines.
in
the
1953
decision,
which
is
in
a
decision
in
the
same
docket
of
the
commission
as
the
order
here
under
review
--
in
the
1953
decision,
the
commission
concluded
that
if
it
were
to
give
controlling
weight
to
the
northern
lines
cost
studies,
it
would
have
to
give
them
higher
divisions
than
the
southern
lines.
but
it
regarded
the
sum
elements
of
the
cost
as
being
transient
in
nature
and
it's
found
that
it
would
be
the
safest
assumption
for
the
future
that
neither
group
of
railroads
would
have
a
substantially
lower
basis
of
operating
expenses
than
the
other.
so,
it
prescribed
equal
fact
to
divisions
for
both
groups
of
lines.
in
1959,
that
same
proceeding
was
reopened
upon
petition
of
the
northern
railroads.
they
alleged
in
the
petition
that
the
experience
of
the
intervening
years
had
confirmed
their
contention
that
their
cost
were
higher
than
those
of
the
southern
lines.
the
commission
reopened
the
case;
evidence
was
taken
between
1959
and
1961
resulting
in
what
the
lower
court
called
a
massive
record.
there
were
extensive
briefs
proposed
report
by
two
examiners
recommending
increase
divisions
for
the
northern
lines,
exceptions,
replies
and
oral
argument.
the
southern
lines
contended
before
the
commission
that
the
relative
costs
of
performing
the
service
involved
constitute
the
decisive
measure
in
determining
just
and
reasonable
divisions.
they
urged
the
commission
to
find
such
cost
on
the
basis
of
the
average
territorial
costs
as
shown
by
the
commission's
rail
form
a
formula
for
official
territorial
lines
and
for
southern
territorial
lines
respectively
but
subject
to
12
adjustments
in
those
territorial
average
cost
which
southern
lines
proposed.
the
commission
accepted
five
of
the
adjustments
and
rejected
seven.
the
result
in
unit
costs,
cost
per
ton
for
certain
services
per
ton
mile
for
certain
for
train
mile
for
others,
those
unit
costs
were
then
applied
to
the
southern
lines
traffic
study
which
those
lines
stated
and
the
commission
agreed
accurately
measured
the
transportation
characteristics
of
the
precise
traffic
to
which
the
divisions
involved
applied.
the
commission
found
that
the
cost
that
which
it
thus
arrived
that
is
the
form
a
territorial
cost
with
five
adjustments
that
were
permitted
were
reasonably
accurate
and
reliable
for
determining
the
relative
contribution
by
the
groups
on
a
cost
of
service
basis.
it
found
that
both
groups
of
carriers
are
being
efficiently
operated.
it
examined
each
of
the
other
factors
specified
by
section
15,
paragraph
6
and
on
all
the
other
facts
of
record
and
it
concluded
that
everything
was
equal
except
the
cost
of
performing
the
service.
it
found
also
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
the
cost
of
performing
the
service
involved.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
as
to
which
it
found
the
northern
lines
cost
higher
than
those
of
the
southern
lines.
and
it
concluded
therefore
that
the
relative
cost
of
the
parties
in
performing
the
service
but
properly
serve
as
a
guide
for
the
determination
of
just
reasonable
and
equitable
divisions.
that
then
was
the
end
of
everything
except
to
translate
its
cost
findings
into
division
scales.
the
southern
lines
asked
the
commission
to
base
the
divisional
scales
to
be
prescribed
on
their
cost
evidence
as
modified
to
the
extent
that
any
of
their
proposed
adjustments
might
be
rejected
and
the
commission
did
precisely
that.
its
formal
finding
of
course
was
at
the
present
divisions
were
unjust
and
unreasonable
and
inequitable.
it
prescribed
the
new
divisional
scales
from
the
southern
lines
cost
as
adjusted.
ten
of
the
11
commissioners
concurred
in
the
majority
opinion.
one
commissioner
thought
that
the
northern
line
should
have
increased
divisions
but
not
as
rate
in
increase
as
had
been
prescribed
in
the
majority
opinion.
overall,
the
divisions
of
the
southern
lines
were
reduced
by
3%
that's
a
stipulated
figure.
upon
suit
by
the
southern
lines
and
the
two
conferences
that
i
have
mentioned
the
southeastern
association
and
the
southern
governors,
the
district
court
held
that
the
cost
evidence
should
have
been
more
refined
than
the
territorial
averages
that
the
commission
itself
was
obliged
to
see
the
evidence
of
the
cost
of
performing
the
specific
traffic
was
of
record
and
that
the
order
should
therefore
be
set
aside
for
lack
of
substantial
evidence
and
adequate
findings.
the
district
court's
order
was
stayed
pending
disposition
of
this
appeal.
the
northern
lines
have
been
receiving
revenues
based
upon
the
higher
divisions
since
april
of
1965.
but
subject
to
a
refund
provision
under
which
if
the
commission's
order
is
permanently
set
aside,
the
northern
lines
would
have
to
refund
the
difference
and
amount
now
approximately
$30
million.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
now
to
discuss
the
question
whether
the
use
of
official
and
southern
territorial
costs
is
supported
by
substantial
evidence
and
adequate
findings
of
the
commission
or
whether
in
truth,
the
district
court's
opinion
represents
a
substitution
of
its
judgment
without
of
the
commission
as
to
the
weight
to
be
given
evidence
and
the
degree
of
refinement
necessary
with
respect
to
the
complex
question
of
railroad
cost
evidence.
then
i
plan
to
discuss
the
passenger
deficit
issue.
the
commission
having
included
in
the
freight
service
costs
a
portion
of
passenger
deficits
on
a
pro
rata
basis
for
both
northern
and
southern
lines.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
well,
cost
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
it
is
fully
distributed
cost
and
revenue
need
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
no,
there's
a
return
element
in
that
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
in
fully
distributed
cost,
there's
a
return
of
4%
on
value
of
property.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
revenue
need
then
is
something
over
and
above
that
kind
of
cost.
if
a
railroad
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
--
is
--
no,
it's
just
to
continue
it
on
operation
for
railroad
is
in
badly
need
of
revenue
and
divisions
based
upon
relative
cost
alone
even
fully
distributed
are
not
sufficient
then
the
commission
has
the
power
to
award
higher
divisions
to
keep
that
railroad
in
operation.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
well,
the
cost
involved,
your
honor,
would
be
just
the
cost
of
performing
the
particular
service
involved
but
it
would
have
all
the
cost
of
performing
the
other
service
not
involved
in
a
given
case.
here,
you
see
the
cost
related
only
to
the
cost
of
performing
the
north-south
freight
service
but
the
commission
does
have
that
power
to
grant
something
over
and
above
the
cost
of
performing
the
service
on
the
basis
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
for
nothing.
i
mean
to
say
it
doesn't
relate
to
anything.
the
railroad
needs
the
money
and
therefore,
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
pardon
me?
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
yes.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
it
needs
it
to
continue
operation.
it's
not
getting
enough
money
to
continue
operation
and
therefore
it
has
to
have
something
over
and
above
its
fully
distributed
cost.
now,
the
classic
case
on
that
is
the
new
england
division's
case
decided
back
in
20th
by
justice
brandies,
in
which
that
kind
of
revenue
need
--
was
used
by
the
commission.
it
was
not
here.
now,
first
as
to
the
commission's
findings
i
believe,
your
honors,
that
a
review
of
appendix
b
to
the
commission's
report
which
contains
42
pages
of
discussion
of
the
adjustments
proposed
by
the
southern
lines
in
the
form
a
territorial
costs
will
convince
--
will
be
convincing
that
the
commission
has
with
unusual
thoroughness
set
forth
the
reasons
why
it
disposed
of
these
cost
issues
in
the
manner
which
it
did.
and
i
will
not
at
this
point
have
anything
further
to
say
about
findings
in
general.
as
to
the
factual
support
for
the
use
of
territorial
average
costs,
i'd
like
to
point
out
these
things
to
the
court.
first,
the
investigation
brought
in
issue
the
divisions
of
rates
on
virtually
all
articles
moving
between
the
north
and
the
south
from
every
station
in
the
north
to
every
station
in
the
south
over
every
northern
railroad
and
every
southern
railroad.
it
was
territory
wide
both
of
the
northern
end
and
on
the
southern
end.
the
fact
that
the
proceeding
was
of
such
great
scope
a
territory
wide
proceeding
itself
i
submit
established
a
strong
case
for
the
use
of
territorial
cost.
both
generally,
and
with
respect
to
such
factors
as
car
costs,
switching,
empty
return
ratios
and
other
large
factors
of
that
nature
as
to
which
the
southern
lines
said,
“our
higher
costs”
that
is
they
said
that
the
high
cost
of
the
northern
lines
were
attributable
to
these
factors.
now,
in
the
class
rate
case,
which
was
affirmed
by
this
court
in
new
york
versus
united
states
back
in
1947,
the
commission
said,
“there
are
different
degrees
of
cost
of
refinement
in
costs
depending
upon
the
purposes
for
which
they
are
intended.
the
ascertainment
of
the
cost
of
transporting
a
particular
commodity
over
a
single
railroad
or
group
of
railroads
obviously
requires
more
refinement
in
procedure
and
the
calculation
of
relative
cost
for
transporting
all
traffic
or
important
and
well
define
segments
of
traffic
by
territorial
groups
of
carriers.”
the
present
case
was
clearly
one
involving
relative
costs
for
transporting
important
segments
of
traffic
by
territorial
groups
of
carriers.
next,
in
the
1953
decision
in
this
same
case,
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
no,
i
don't
think
they
do,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
well,
the
only
illustration
i
can
give
you
your
honor
is
that
the
traffic
involved
in
the
north-south
traffic
involved
for
southern
lines
is
very
much
greater
than
for
northern
lines.
i
believe
that
it's
about
20%
for
southern
lines
and
about
6%
for
northern.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
well,
if
your
honor
please
in
that
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
it
did
that
except
to
the
extent
that
it
allowed
five
of
the
adjustments
that
were
submitted
by
the
southern
lines
and
declined
seven.
so
do
you
see
your
honor
on
the
great
body
of
this
cost
evidence
the
territorial
cost
evidence;
the
southern
lines
themselves
used
the
territorial
costs.
it
amount
to
almost
90%
of
all
the
cost
that
they
submitted
where
the
territorial
averages.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
now,
if
your
honor
please,
in
the
class
rate
case
which
was
the
first
case
in
which
the
commission
used
cost
evidence
under
this
formula
and
before
this
formula
was
devised,
they
had
no
reliable
way
of
getting
service
cost.
in
that
case,
the
percentage
that
class
rate
traffic
was
of
total
traffic
of
the
railroads
involved
was
an
even
lower
percentage
than
that
involved
here
for
either
northern
or
southern
lines.
and
then,
there
was
the
mountain
pacific
class
rate
case
in
which
it
was
lower
than
this,
very
substantially
lower.
and
in
the
transcontinental
divisions
case
which
your
honors
decided
very
recently
in
chicago
and
north
western
versus
santa
fe
railway
company.
in
that
case,
the
commission
made
a
number
of
adjustments
and
it
concluded
that
in
a
case
dealing
with
territorial
wide
application
of
rates
or
divisions
that
the
territorial
costs
and
the
refine
costs
are
substantially
the
same.
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
there
was
more
refinement
there
than
there
was
here.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
no,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
there
was
not
a
finding
in
those
words.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
yes,
there
was
a
finding
that
the
costs
as
adjusted
accurately
and
reliably
represented
the
cost
of
performing
the
north-south
service.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
very
well,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
no,
there
was
not
your
honor.
but
i
just
like
to
say
in
pursuance
for
a
moment
of
the
point
that
i
have
been
arguing
that
the
present
record
establishes
that
the
north-south
traffic
has
handled
as
an
indiscriminate
part
of
the
whole
with
all
the
other
traffic
of
the
northern
railroads,
and
our
witness
said
in
view
of
the
fact
the
way
a
railroads
are
operated,
he
was
sure
the
same
thing
was
true
in
the
south.
and
this
related
to
all
the
upper
--
all
the
large
operations
switching
in
origin
terminal,
line
whole
service
in
road
trains
or
freight
or
weight
trains,
empty
return
ratios
and
all
of
those
various
large
categories
of
traffic.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
i
will
go
now
--
i
was
going
to
say
more
in
this
first
point,
but
i
think
i
better
get
to
the
passenger
deficit
point.
and
at
the
outset,
i
want
to
point
out
that
when
the
northern
lines
brought
forth
their
cost
study,
they
predicated
it
upon
the
freight
service
costs
alone.
they
have
nothing
in
it
for
any
kind
of
passenger
service.
the
southern
lines
complained
that
contrary
to
the
practice
of
the
cost
finding
section
of
the
commission,
we
have
not
included
the
passenger
deficit,
and
they
said
and
i
quote
their
words,
“the
northern
line
study
is
defective
in
computing
constant
costs
without
consideration
of
passenger
deficits.”
now,
although
it
was
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
northern
lines
that
the
commission
consider
passenger
deficits
because
we
would
have
done
better
just
on
freight
service
cost
alone,
we
stated
that
we
would
have
no
objection
to
their
--
in
their
inclusion.
but
that
we
did
object
to
the
southern
line's
proposal
that
there
be
called
out
of
the
passenger
deficits
so
much
thereof
as
might
be
attributable
to
commutation
service,
which
was
the
proposal
of
the
southern
lines.
they
sought
to
justify
that
proposal,
proposal
to
exclude
commutation
deficits
upon
the
theory
that
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
well
your
honor,
i
didn't
intend
to
say
that
they
could
not
be
computed.
i
wouldn't
say
one
way
or
another
about
that.
the
commission's
finding
was
that
the
cost,
the
suburban
service
deficit
includes
common
cost
with
freight
service.
the
deficits
from
commutation
service
should
not
be
excluded
from
the
constant
costs.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
your
honor,
it
imposes
very
great
problems.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
if
your
honor
please,
in
a
case
called
rail
passenger
train
deficit,
in
306
icc
at
714
decided
in
1959,
i
believe
that
you
will
find
there
an
expression
of
the
commission
to
the
extent
to
the
effect
that
in
deciding
how
much
of
the
common
cost
should
be
allocated
is
largely
a
question
of
judgment,
and
a
rather
speculative
factor.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
306
at
417.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
yes
your
honor.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
oh
yes.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
well,
they
make
that
on
the
basis
of
the
application
of
a
cost
formula,
which
they
used
day
in
and
day
out.
this
is
a
formula
used
by
the
commission
and
by
all
the
parties
before
including
the
southern
lines,
we
can
and
we
got
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
oh
this,
and
i'm
speaking
now
of
the
formula
for
determining
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
oh,
there
are
some
sampling
in
it
your
honor,
but
by
and
large
it's
an
analysis
of
the
accounts
of
the
railroads
which
are
kept
in
accordance
with
the
commission's
uniform
system
of
accounts,
and
they'll
get
a
unit
cost
of
performing
this
service
or
that,
and
then
a
traffic
study
is
made
to
find
out
how
many
units
of
the
cost
--
how
many
units
of
that
service
are
involved
in
the
service
your
studying.
they'll
apply
the
unit
cost
to
that.
this
is
done
day
in
and
day
out
before
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
well
your
honor,
i
did
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
it
might
reference
to
it
being
a
matter
of
judgment
had
to
do
with
the
passenger
service
and
only
those
expenses
of
the
passenger
that
are
common
with
freight.
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that
this
formula
of
the
commission
for
determining
freight
service
cost
was
dependent
upon
judgment.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
they
get
it
from
annual
reports
of
the
railroads
which
account
by
the
account
are
submitted
to
the
commission.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
well,
the
commission
regularly
has
investigators
going
checking
books
of
railroads.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
yes
your
honor.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
your
honor,
i
don't
know
the
extent
to
which
that
audit
how
deep
it
goes.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
yes
your
honor.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
correct.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
yes
your
honor.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
well,
sometimes
it
does.
other
times,
there's
enough
of
it
that
there
has
to
be
an
extra
track,
and
certainly,
there
has
to
be
stations,
and
then
you
got
direct
expenses
you
are
such
as
a
train
true
wages,
locomotives,
cars,
couch
yards,
you've
own
these
facilities
which
are
attributable
only
to
passenger
service
on
the
intercity
side
as
well
as
the
commuters.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
it
was.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
yes
your
honor,
it
was.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
that
is
correct.
there's
one
southern
line
that
has
a
big
commuter
operation,
the
illinois
central,
but
by
and
large,
they
do
not.
now,
i
would
like
to
develop
that
point
that
the
non-commutation
passenger
service
has
a
great
deal
of
expenses
that
are
solely
related
to
that
service.
the
kind
of
service
that's
rendered
down
south,
a
local
train
service,
intercity
passenger
train
service,
they
have
these
solely
related
expenses,
and
the
commission
didn't
exclude
those
when
it
made
it's
calculation
of
the
commuter
--
passenger
deficit
to
the
allocated
to
this
north-south
freight
service.
i
believe
it
to
be
of
great
importance
in
connection
with
this
point
your
honors
to
point
out
to
you
that
the
commission
allocated
the
overall
deficit;
that
is
from
all
passenger
operations
to
the
north-south
service,
both
for
northern
and
southern
lines.
the
northern
lines
passenger
revenues
exceeded
the
solely
related
passenger
costs.
we
had
a
deficit
only
when
common
costs
were
added.
now,
the
southern
lines
on
the
other
hand,
their
direct
passenger
costs,
their
solely
related
passenger
costs
exceeded
their
passenger
revenues.
the
district
court
found
that
it
was
proper
in
the
north-south
traffic,
north-south
service
in
costing
it
out
to
include
common
expenses,
but
not
solely
related.
on
--
we
are
the
ones
therefore
who
satisfy
that
standard.
the
commission's
allocation
of
costs
included
for
us
only
common
expenses
which
the
court
said
could
be
allocated,
but
for
the
southern
lines,
it
included
not
only
common,
but
the
solely
related
expenses
too.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
common
is
between
freight
and
passenger.
now,
i
should
like
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
there's
not
question
of
the
commission's
power
to
consider
passenger
deficits
in
making
freight
rates
and
i
submit
in
the
divisions.
you
held
in
the
king
case
that
it
was
proper
for
the
commission
to
consider
passenger
deficit
and
fixing
freight
rates,
and
the
court
did
not
distinguish
there
between
solely
related
cost
and
the
other
kind
of
cost.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
well,
this
is
just
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
this
is
limited
to
the
divisions
your
honor.
of
course,
the
commission
has
considered
the
passenger
deficits
in
fixing
the
general
level
of
freight
rates,
and
it
seems
fare
therefore
to
consider
the
passenger
deficits
in
dividing
the
freight
rates.
but
if
they
do
it
ought
to
be
the
overall
deficits.
i
like
to
take
just
a
minute
from
my
rebuttal
if
i
--
it's
that's
proper
your
honor?
i
would
like
to
say
that
--
in
the
cnnw
case
which
you
decided
very
recently,
fixing
divisions
between
transcontinental
lines
that
called
mountain
pacific
and
the
mid-western
lines;
you
have
substantially
the
same
cost
questions
involved
here,
except
that
you
didn't
have
this
passenger
deficit
matter.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
oh,
i
don't
think
so
your
honor
and
i
really
don't
know.
i
haven't
compared
those.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
over
the
mountains.
well,
for
that
factor
that
they
would
be
surely,
but
that
they're
not
involved
here.
i
just
cite
that
case
as
a
precedent.
in
that
case
your
honors,
the
two
conferences
which
are
here
aligned
with
the
southern
railways
filed
a
petition
for
leave
to
file
an
amici
brief.
they
made
the
point
that
if
this
court
where
to
decide
the
cost
issues
in
that
case,
it
would
prejudice
the
decision
and
it
would
control
the
decision
in
our
case
in
the
lower
court.
they
said
that
to
all
intents
and
purposes,
the
cost
issues
in
that
case
where
exactly
the
same
as
the
cost
issues
in
the
present
case.
and
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
that
decision
is
a
very
important
precedent
in
the
decision
of
this
case.
thank
you.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
mr.
trienens
agreed
that
the
form
a
cost
formula
is
a
good
cost
formula.
the
territorial
cost
as
developed
by
that
cost
formula
were
applied
to
the
precise
elements
of
service
incurred
in
performing
this
north-south
traffic
as
revealed
by
the
southern
lines
cost
study.
the
southern
lines
know
where
to
look
for
situations
in
which
territorial
average
costs
may
not
proper
--
accurately
reflect
the
cost
of
this
service.
they
looked
for
those
places.
they
presented
to
the
commission
their
reasons
why
they
thought
that
territorial
average
cost
were
not
good.
the
commission
minutely
examined
each
one
of
those
reasons
in
appendix
b
to
its
report,
and
showed
that
these
adjustments
of
southern
lines
were
based
upon
assumptions
and
wholly
invalid
evidence.
and
they
showed
why
they
thought
the
territorial
average
cost
were
good.
i
commend
to
your
honors
a
reading
of
section
(b)
to
the
commission's
report.
and
i
believe
you
will
be
satisfied
about
that.
mr.
trienens
talked
about
car
costs.
they
said
that
they
wanted
to
get
the
cost
closer
to
the
north-south
traffic.
and
what
do
you
suppose
they
offered
in
substitution
for
the
northern
and
southern
lines
cost,
on
car
cost?
they
used
the
average
car
cost
of
all
the
railroads
in
the
united
states.
and
the
commission
minutely
examined
that
and
said
no
that
that
wasn't
representative.
that
the
northern
and
southern
lines
own
cost
were
more
representative
of
the
car
cost
than
the
u.s.car
cost.
the
southern
line
said,
“the
car
cost
of
the
northern
and
southern
lines
are
not
representative
here
because
mostly
in
this
service
boxcars
are
use,
whereas
the
northern
and
southern
lines
have
more
open
hopper
cars.”
the
commission
analyzed
that,
and
it
found
that
it
cost
more
to
own
and
maintain
open
hoppers
than
boxcars.
so
to
that
extent,
the
territorial
cost
would
over
--
would
be
an
overstatement,
rather
than
an
understatement.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
they
also
said
that
there
was
a
difference
in
utilization.
the
commission
analyzed
that
and
found
that
that
wasn't
a
factor.
the
commission
said,
“it
is
known
what
the
facts
--
what
factors
caused
the
northern
lines
to
have
higher
car
cost
than
southern.”
in
the
first
place,
northern
lines
have
more
--
have
higher
wages,
pay
higher
wage
rates
than
southern
lines.
they
said
the
northern
lines
pay
higher
taxes
than
southern
lines
and
that
overall
there
is
a
greater
utilization
in
the
south
than
in
the
north.
i
think
we
pretty
adequately
covered
that
on
our
brief.
your
honors,
in
the
transcontinental
case
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
let
me
answer
by
reference
to
a
decision
of
the
commission.
i
wanted
to
get
to
that
point.
our
friends
on
the
other
side
have
said
that
the
rates
are
equal.
they're
talking
only
about
class
rates.
class
rates
boom
only
1%
of
the
traffic.
the
commission
said
in
the
cases
cited
on
page
14
of
our
reply
brief,
“rate
levels
within
the
north
have
become
higher
than
within
the
south.”
and
they
said
that
in
a
case
back
in
'56,
and
we've
shown
that
since
that
time
in
general
freight
rate
increase
cases,
the
commission
has
allowed
even
greater
increases
within
the
north
and
from
and
to
the
north
that
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
no
your
honor.
the
increases
are
generally
the
same,
but
they
are
imposed
on
higher
base
wages
than
the
south.
i
submit
your
honors
that
this
case
really
could
be
controlled
by
the
cnnw
case.
to
all
intents
and
purposes,
the
questions
on
these
costs
issues
are
the
same.
thank
you.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
decree
of
a
three-judge
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana
setting
aside
an
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
which
prescribe
the
joint
--
the
divisions
of
joint
rates
to
be
received
by
northern
and
southern
railroads
respectively
from
freight
traffic
moving
between
official
territory
and
southern
territory
in
both
directions.
official
territory
may
generally
be
described
as
that
part
as
the
northeastern
part
of
the
united
states
and
the
southern
territory
the
southeastern
part.
more
particularly,
official
territory
would
be
the
territory
east
to
the
mississippi
river
north
of
the
ohio
and
certain
cities
in
virginia
such
as
richmond.
southern
territory
is
east
of
the
mississippi
and
south
of
official
territory.
the
appellants
are
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
the
northern
railroads
and
the
appellees
are
the
southern
railroads
and
two
associations,
one
the
southern
governor's
conference
and
the
other
southeastern
association
of
railroad
and
utility
commissioners.
your
honors
will
recall
i
believe
that
a
joint
rate
is
one
which
applies
over
two
or
more
railroads
but
is
stated
in
a
single
sum.
the
divisions
in
issue
in
this
case
were
primary
divisions.
that
is
to
say
divisions
which
applied
to
and
from
the
certain
gateways
between
northern
and
southern
railroads
and
if
there
was
more
than
railroad
north
to
the
gateway
those
two
railroads
over
three
railroads
would
get
their
share
of
the
revenue
from
subdivisions
of
the
primary
division
and
likewise
south
of
the
gateways.
those
subdivisions
were
not
in
issue
in
this
case
only
the
primary
divisions.
the
railroad's
evidence
both
that
submitted
by
the
southern
lines
and
that's
submitted
by
the
northern
lines
was
on
a
group
basis
in
which
all
the
northern
lines
were
grouped
together
and
there
figures
submitted
by
on
the
group
basis
and
likewise
for
the
southern
lines.
and
it
was
decided
by
the
commission
on
a
group
basis
except
that
the
norfolk
southern
railroad
one
of
the
southern
group,
was
awarded
division
higher
than
that
granted
to
the
southern
lines
generally.
this
was
in
recognition
of
its
greater
revenue
needs
and
there
is
no
issue
about
that
before
the
court.
the
commission
is
empowered
by
paragraph
6
of
section
15
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
to
prescribe
just
and
reasonable
divisions
whenever
after
hearing
in
its
opinion
it
finds
that
the
existing
divisions
are
unjust
unreasonable
or
inequitable.
the
case
before
the
commission
was
one
that
was
originally
decided
in
1953.
before
that
decision,
the
divisional
factors
prescribed
for
southern
lines
were
generally
25%
higher
mile
per
mile
than
those
prescribed
for
northern
lines.
and
on
the
very
important
item
of
citrus
fruit
which
moves
in
great
larger
in
south
to
the
north,
the
--
an
earlier
case
had
fixed
the
divisions
as
high
as
85%
higher
than
the
northern
lines
factors.
now,
i
should
correct
that.
the
northern
lines
--
the
southern
lines
didn't
get
divisions
85%
higher
but
the
factors
which
go
into
make
that
were
85%
higher
so
that
the
southern
line
got
something
a
lesser
percentage
than
the
85%
but
very
substantially
more
than
the
northern
lines.
in
the
1953
decision,
which
is
in
a
decision
in
the
same
docket
of
the
commission
as
the
order
here
under
review
--
in
the
1953
decision,
the
commission
concluded
that
if
it
were
to
give
controlling
weight
to
the
northern
lines
cost
studies,
it
would
have
to
give
them
higher
divisions
than
the
southern
lines.
but
it
regarded
the
sum
elements
of
the
cost
as
being
transient
in
nature
and
it's
found
that
it
would
be
the
safest
assumption
for
the
future
that
neither
group
of
railroads
would
have
a
substantially
lower
basis
of
operating
expenses
than
the
other.
so,
it
prescribed
equal
fact
to
divisions
for
both
groups
of
lines.
in
1959,
that
same
proceeding
was
reopened
upon
petition
of
the
northern
railroads.
they
alleged
in
the
petition
that
the
experience
of
the
intervening
years
had
confirmed
their
contention
that
their
cost
were
higher
than
those
of
the
southern
lines.
the
commission
reopened
the
case;
evidence
was
taken
between
1959
and
1961
resulting
in
what
the
lower
court
called
a
massive
record.
there
were
extensive
briefs
proposed
report
by
two
examiners
recommending
increase
divisions
for
the
northern
lines,
exceptions,
replies
and
oral
argument.
the
southern
lines
contended
before
the
commission
that
the
relative
costs
of
performing
the
service
involved
constitute
the
decisive
measure
in
determining
just
and
reasonable
divisions.
they
urged
the
commission
to
find
such
cost
on
the
basis
of
the
average
territorial
costs
as
shown
by
the
commission's
rail
form
a
formula
for
official
territorial
lines
and
for
southern
territorial
lines
respectively
but
subject
to
12
adjustments
in
those
territorial
average
cost
which
southern
lines
proposed.
the
commission
accepted
five
of
the
adjustments
and
rejected
seven.
the
result
in
unit
costs,
cost
per
ton
for
certain
services
per
ton
mile
for
certain
for
train
mile
for
others,
those
unit
costs
were
then
applied
to
the
southern
lines
traffic
study
which
those
lines
stated
and
the
commission
agreed
accurately
measured
the
transportation
characteristics
of
the
precise
traffic
to
which
the
divisions
involved
applied.
the
commission
found
that
the
cost
that
which
it
thus
arrived
that
is
the
form
a
territorial
cost
with
five
adjustments
that
were
permitted
were
reasonably
accurate
and
reliable
for
determining
the
relative
contribution
by
the
groups
on
a
cost
of
service
basis.
it
found
that
both
groups
of
carriers
are
being
efficiently
operated.
it
examined
each
of
the
other
factors
specified
by
section
15,
paragraph
6
and
on
all
the
other
facts
of
record
and
it
concluded
that
everything
was
equal
except
the
cost
of
performing
the
service.
it
found
also
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
the
cost
of
performing
the
service
involved.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
as
to
which
it
found
the
northern
lines
cost
higher
than
those
of
the
southern
lines.
and
it
concluded
therefore
that
the
relative
cost
of
the
parties
in
performing
the
service
but
properly
serve
as
a
guide
for
the
determination
of
just
reasonable
and
equitable
divisions.
that
then
was
the
end
of
everything
except
to
translate
its
cost
findings
into
division
scales.
the
southern
lines
asked
the
commission
to
base
the
divisional
scales
to
be
prescribed
on
their
cost
evidence
as
modified
to
the
extent
that
any
of
their
proposed
adjustments
might
be
rejected
and
the
commission
did
precisely
that.
its
formal
finding
of
course
was
at
the
present
divisions
were
unjust
and
unreasonable
and
inequitable.
it
prescribed
the
new
divisional
scales
from
the
southern
lines
cost
as
adjusted.
ten
of
the
11
commissioners
concurred
in
the
majority
opinion.
one
commissioner
thought
that
the
northern
line
should
have
increased
divisions
but
not
as
rate
in
increase
as
had
been
prescribed
in
the
majority
opinion.
overall,
the
divisions
of
the
southern
lines
were
reduced
by
3%
that's
a
stipulated
figure.
upon
suit
by
the
southern
lines
and
the
two
conferences
that
i
have
mentioned
the
southeastern
association
and
the
southern
governors,
the
district
court
held
that
the
cost
evidence
should
have
been
more
refined
than
the
territorial
averages
that
the
commission
itself
was
obliged
to
see
the
evidence
of
the
cost
of
performing
the
specific
traffic
was
of
record
and
that
the
order
should
therefore
be
set
aside
for
lack
of
substantial
evidence
and
adequate
findings.
the
district
court's
order
was
stayed
pending
disposition
of
this
appeal.
the
northern
lines
have
been
receiving
revenues
based
upon
the
higher
divisions
since
april
of
1965.
but
subject
to
a
refund
provision
under
which
if
the
commission's
order
is
permanently
set
aside,
the
northern
lines
would
have
to
refund
the
difference
and
amount
now
approximately
$30
million.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
now
to
discuss
the
question
whether
the
use
of
official
and
southern
territorial
costs
is
supported
by
substantial
evidence
and
adequate
findings
of
the
commission
or
whether
in
truth,
the
district
court's
opinion
represents
a
substitution
of
its
judgment
without
of
the
commission
as
to
the
weight
to
be
given
evidence
and
the
degree
of
refinement
necessary
with
respect
to
the
complex
question
of
railroad
cost
evidence.
then
i
plan
to
discuss
the
passenger
deficit
issue.
the
commission
having
included
in
the
freight
service
costs
a
portion
of
passenger
deficits
on
a
pro
rata
basis
for
both
northern
and
southern
lines.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
well,
cost
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
it
is
fully
distributed
cost
and
revenue
need
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
no,
there's
a
return
element
in
that
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
in
fully
distributed
cost,
there's
a
return
of
4%
on
value
of
property.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
revenue
need
then
is
something
over
and
above
that
kind
of
cost.
if
a
railroad
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
--
is
--
no,
it's
just
to
continue
it
on
operation
for
railroad
is
in
badly
need
of
revenue
and
divisions
based
upon
relative
cost
alone
even
fully
distributed
are
not
sufficient
then
the
commission
has
the
power
to
award
higher
divisions
to
keep
that
railroad
in
operation.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
well,
the
cost
involved,
your
honor,
would
be
just
the
cost
of
performing
the
particular
service
involved
but
it
would
have
all
the
cost
of
performing
the
other
service
not
involved
in
a
given
case.
here,
you
see
the
cost
related
only
to
the
cost
of
performing
the
north-south
freight
service
but
the
commission
does
have
that
power
to
grant
something
over
and
above
the
cost
of
performing
the
service
on
the
basis
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
for
nothing.
i
mean
to
say
it
doesn't
relate
to
anything.
the
railroad
needs
the
money
and
therefore,
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
pardon
me?
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
yes.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
it
needs
it
to
continue
operation.
it's
not
getting
enough
money
to
continue
operation
and
therefore
it
has
to
have
something
over
and
above
its
fully
distributed
cost.
now,
the
classic
case
on
that
is
the
new
england
division's
case
decided
back
in
20th
by
justice
brandies,
in
which
that
kind
of
revenue
need
--
was
used
by
the
commission.
it
was
not
here.
now,
first
as
to
the
commission's
findings
i
believe,
your
honors,
that
a
review
of
appendix
b
to
the
commission's
report
which
contains
42
pages
of
discussion
of
the
adjustments
proposed
by
the
southern
lines
in
the
form
a
territorial
costs
will
convince
--
will
be
convincing
that
the
commission
has
with
unusual
thoroughness
set
forth
the
reasons
why
it
disposed
of
these
cost
issues
in
the
manner
which
it
did.
and
i
will
not
at
this
point
have
anything
further
to
say
about
findings
in
general.
as
to
the
factual
support
for
the
use
of
territorial
average
costs,
i'd
like
to
point
out
these
things
to
the
court.
first,
the
investigation
brought
in
issue
the
divisions
of
rates
on
virtually
all
articles
moving
between
the
north
and
the
south
from
every
station
in
the
north
to
every
station
in
the
south
over
every
northern
railroad
and
every
southern
railroad.
it
was
territory
wide
both
of
the
northern
end
and
on
the
southern
end.
the
fact
that
the
proceeding
was
of
such
great
scope
a
territory
wide
proceeding
itself
i
submit
established
a
strong
case
for
the
use
of
territorial
cost.
both
generally,
and
with
respect
to
such
factors
as
car
costs,
switching,
empty
return
ratios
and
other
large
factors
of
that
nature
as
to
which
the
southern
lines
said,
“our
higher
costs”
that
is
they
said
that
the
high
cost
of
the
northern
lines
were
attributable
to
these
factors.
now,
in
the
class
rate
case,
which
was
affirmed
by
this
court
in
new
york
versus
united
states
back
in
1947,
the
commission
said,
“there
are
different
degrees
of
cost
of
refinement
in
costs
depending
upon
the
purposes
for
which
they
are
intended.
the
ascertainment
of
the
cost
of
transporting
a
particular
commodity
over
a
single
railroad
or
group
of
railroads
obviously
requires
more
refinement
in
procedure
and
the
calculation
of
relative
cost
for
transporting
all
traffic
or
important
and
well
define
segments
of
traffic
by
territorial
groups
of
carriers.”
the
present
case
was
clearly
one
involving
relative
costs
for
transporting
important
segments
of
traffic
by
territorial
groups
of
carriers.
next,
in
the
1953
decision
in
this
same
case,
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
no,
i
don't
think
they
do,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
well,
the
only
illustration
i
can
give
you
your
honor
is
that
the
traffic
involved
in
the
north-south
traffic
involved
for
southern
lines
is
very
much
greater
than
for
northern
lines.
i
believe
that
it's
about
20%
for
southern
lines
and
about
6%
for
northern.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
well,
if
your
honor
please
in
that
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
it
did
that
except
to
the
extent
that
it
allowed
five
of
the
adjustments
that
were
submitted
by
the
southern
lines
and
declined
seven.
so
do
you
see
your
honor
on
the
great
body
of
this
cost
evidence
the
territorial
cost
evidence;
the
southern
lines
themselves
used
the
territorial
costs.
it
amount
to
almost
90%
of
all
the
cost
that
they
submitted
where
the
territorial
averages.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
now,
if
your
honor
please,
in
the
class
rate
case
which
was
the
first
case
in
which
the
commission
used
cost
evidence
under
this
formula
and
before
this
formula
was
devised,
they
had
no
reliable
way
of
getting
service
cost.
in
that
case,
the
percentage
that
class
rate
traffic
was
of
total
traffic
of
the
railroads
involved
was
an
even
lower
percentage
than
that
involved
here
for
either
northern
or
southern
lines.
and
then,
there
was
the
mountain
pacific
class
rate
case
in
which
it
was
lower
than
this,
very
substantially
lower.
and
in
the
transcontinental
divisions
case
which
your
honors
decided
very
recently
in
chicago
and
north
western
versus
santa
fe
railway
company.
in
that
case,
the
commission
made
a
number
of
adjustments
and
it
concluded
that
in
a
case
dealing
with
territorial
wide
application
of
rates
or
divisions
that
the
territorial
costs
and
the
refine
costs
are
substantially
the
same.
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
there
was
more
refinement
there
than
there
was
here.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
no,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
there
was
not
a
finding
in
those
words.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
yes,
there
was
a
finding
that
the
costs
as
adjusted
accurately
and
reliably
represented
the
cost
of
performing
the
north-south
service.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
very
well,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
no,
there
was
not
your
honor.
but
i
just
like
to
say
in
pursuance
for
a
moment
of
the
point
that
i
have
been
arguing
that
the
present
record
establishes
that
the
north-south
traffic
has
handled
as
an
indiscriminate
part
of
the
whole
with
all
the
other
traffic
of
the
northern
railroads,
and
our
witness
said
in
view
of
the
fact
the
way
a
railroads
are
operated,
he
was
sure
the
same
thing
was
true
in
the
south.
and
this
related
to
all
the
upper
--
all
the
large
operations
switching
in
origin
terminal,
line
whole
service
in
road
trains
or
freight
or
weight
trains,
empty
return
ratios
and
all
of
those
various
large
categories
of
traffic.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
i
will
go
now
--
i
was
going
to
say
more
in
this
first
point,
but
i
think
i
better
get
to
the
passenger
deficit
point.
and
at
the
outset,
i
want
to
point
out
that
when
the
northern
lines
brought
forth
their
cost
study,
they
predicated
it
upon
the
freight
service
costs
alone.
they
have
nothing
in
it
for
any
kind
of
passenger
service.
the
southern
lines
complained
that
contrary
to
the
practice
of
the
cost
finding
section
of
the
commission,
we
have
not
included
the
passenger
deficit,
and
they
said
and
i
quote
their
words,
“the
northern
line
study
is
defective
in
computing
constant
costs
without
consideration
of
passenger
deficits.”
now,
although
it
was
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
northern
lines
that
the
commission
consider
passenger
deficits
because
we
would
have
done
better
just
on
freight
service
cost
alone,
we
stated
that
we
would
have
no
objection
to
their
--
in
their
inclusion.
but
that
we
did
object
to
the
southern
line's
proposal
that
there
be
called
out
of
the
passenger
deficits
so
much
thereof
as
might
be
attributable
to
commutation
service,
which
was
the
proposal
of
the
southern
lines.
they
sought
to
justify
that
proposal,
proposal
to
exclude
commutation
deficits
upon
the
theory
that
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
well
your
honor,
i
didn't
intend
to
say
that
they
could
not
be
computed.
i
wouldn't
say
one
way
or
another
about
that.
the
commission's
finding
was
that
the
cost,
the
suburban
service
deficit
includes
common
cost
with
freight
service.
the
deficits
from
commutation
service
should
not
be
excluded
from
the
constant
costs.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
your
honor,
it
imposes
very
great
problems.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
if
your
honor
please,
in
a
case
called
rail
passenger
train
deficit,
in
306
icc
at
714
decided
in
1959,
i
believe
that
you
will
find
there
an
expression
of
the
commission
to
the
extent
to
the
effect
that
in
deciding
how
much
of
the
common
cost
should
be
allocated
is
largely
a
question
of
judgment,
and
a
rather
speculative
factor.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
306
at
417.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
yes
your
honor.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
oh
yes.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
well,
they
make
that
on
the
basis
of
the
application
of
a
cost
formula,
which
they
used
day
in
and
day
out.
this
is
a
formula
used
by
the
commission
and
by
all
the
parties
before
including
the
southern
lines,
we
can
and
we
got
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
oh
this,
and
i'm
speaking
now
of
the
formula
for
determining
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
oh,
there
are
some
sampling
in
it
your
honor,
but
by
and
large
it's
an
analysis
of
the
accounts
of
the
railroads
which
are
kept
in
accordance
with
the
commission's
uniform
system
of
accounts,
and
they'll
get
a
unit
cost
of
performing
this
service
or
that,
and
then
a
traffic
study
is
made
to
find
out
how
many
units
of
the
cost
--
how
many
units
of
that
service
are
involved
in
the
service
your
studying.
they'll
apply
the
unit
cost
to
that.
this
is
done
day
in
and
day
out
before
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
well
your
honor,
i
did
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
it
might
reference
to
it
being
a
matter
of
judgment
had
to
do
with
the
passenger
service
and
only
those
expenses
of
the
passenger
that
are
common
with
freight.
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that
this
formula
of
the
commission
for
determining
freight
service
cost
was
dependent
upon
judgment.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
they
get
it
from
annual
reports
of
the
railroads
which
account
by
the
account
are
submitted
to
the
commission.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
well,
the
commission
regularly
has
investigators
going
checking
books
of
railroads.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
yes
your
honor.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
your
honor,
i
don't
know
the
extent
to
which
that
audit
how
deep
it
goes.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
yes
your
honor.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
correct.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
yes
your
honor.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
well,
sometimes
it
does.
other
times,
there's
enough
of
it
that
there
has
to
be
an
extra
track,
and
certainly,
there
has
to
be
stations,
and
then
you
got
direct
expenses
you
are
such
as
a
train
true
wages,
locomotives,
cars,
couch
yards,
you've
own
these
facilities
which
are
attributable
only
to
passenger
service
on
the
intercity
side
as
well
as
the
commuters.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
it
was.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
yes
your
honor,
it
was.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
that
is
correct.
there's
one
southern
line
that
has
a
big
commuter
operation,
the
illinois
central,
but
by
and
large,
they
do
not.
now,
i
would
like
to
develop
that
point
that
the
non-commutation
passenger
service
has
a
great
deal
of
expenses
that
are
solely
related
to
that
service.
the
kind
of
service
that's
rendered
down
south,
a
local
train
service,
intercity
passenger
train
service,
they
have
these
solely
related
expenses,
and
the
commission
didn't
exclude
those
when
it
made
it's
calculation
of
the
commuter
--
passenger
deficit
to
the
allocated
to
this
north-south
freight
service.
i
believe
it
to
be
of
great
importance
in
connection
with
this
point
your
honors
to
point
out
to
you
that
the
commission
allocated
the
overall
deficit;
that
is
from
all
passenger
operations
to
the
north-south
service,
both
for
northern
and
southern
lines.
the
northern
lines
passenger
revenues
exceeded
the
solely
related
passenger
costs.
we
had
a
deficit
only
when
common
costs
were
added.
now,
the
southern
lines
on
the
other
hand,
their
direct
passenger
costs,
their
solely
related
passenger
costs
exceeded
their
passenger
revenues.
the
district
court
found
that
it
was
proper
in
the
north-south
traffic,
north-south
service
in
costing
it
out
to
include
common
expenses,
but
not
solely
related.
on
--
we
are
the
ones
therefore
who
satisfy
that
standard.
the
commission's
allocation
of
costs
included
for
us
only
common
expenses
which
the
court
said
could
be
allocated,
but
for
the
southern
lines,
it
included
not
only
common,
but
the
solely
related
expenses
too.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
common
is
between
freight
and
passenger.
now,
i
should
like
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
there's
not
question
of
the
commission's
power
to
consider
passenger
deficits
in
making
freight
rates
and
i
submit
in
the
divisions.
you
held
in
the
king
case
that
it
was
proper
for
the
commission
to
consider
passenger
deficit
and
fixing
freight
rates,
and
the
court
did
not
distinguish
there
between
solely
related
cost
and
the
other
kind
of
cost.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
well,
this
is
just
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
this
is
limited
to
the
divisions
your
honor.
of
course,
the
commission
has
considered
the
passenger
deficits
in
fixing
the
general
level
of
freight
rates,
and
it
seems
fare
therefore
to
consider
the
passenger
deficits
in
dividing
the
freight
rates.
but
if
they
do
it
ought
to
be
the
overall
deficits.
i
like
to
take
just
a
minute
from
my
rebuttal
if
i
--
it's
that's
proper
your
honor?
i
would
like
to
say
that
--
in
the
cnnw
case
which
you
decided
very
recently,
fixing
divisions
between
transcontinental
lines
that
called
mountain
pacific
and
the
mid-western
lines;
you
have
substantially
the
same
cost
questions
involved
here,
except
that
you
didn't
have
this
passenger
deficit
matter.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
oh,
i
don't
think
so
your
honor
and
i
really
don't
know.
i
haven't
compared
those.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
over
the
mountains.
well,
for
that
factor
that
they
would
be
surely,
but
that
they're
not
involved
here.
i
just
cite
that
case
as
a
precedent.
in
that
case
your
honors,
the
two
conferences
which
are
here
aligned
with
the
southern
railways
filed
a
petition
for
leave
to
file
an
amici
brief.
they
made
the
point
that
if
this
court
where
to
decide
the
cost
issues
in
that
case,
it
would
prejudice
the
decision
and
it
would
control
the
decision
in
our
case
in
the
lower
court.
they
said
that
to
all
intents
and
purposes,
the
cost
issues
in
that
case
where
exactly
the
same
as
the
cost
issues
in
the
present
case.
and
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
that
decision
is
a
very
important
precedent
in
the
decision
of
this
case.
thank
you.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
mr.
trienens
agreed
that
the
form
a
cost
formula
is
a
good
cost
formula.
the
territorial
cost
as
developed
by
that
cost
formula
were
applied
to
the
precise
elements
of
service
incurred
in
performing
this
north-south
traffic
as
revealed
by
the
southern
lines
cost
study.
the
southern
lines
know
where
to
look
for
situations
in
which
territorial
average
costs
may
not
proper
--
accurately
reflect
the
cost
of
this
service.
they
looked
for
those
places.
they
presented
to
the
commission
their
reasons
why
they
thought
that
territorial
average
cost
were
not
good.
the
commission
minutely
examined
each
one
of
those
reasons
in
appendix
b
to
its
report,
and
showed
that
these
adjustments
of
southern
lines
were
based
upon
assumptions
and
wholly
invalid
evidence.
and
they
showed
why
they
thought
the
territorial
average
cost
were
good.
i
commend
to
your
honors
a
reading
of
section
(b)
to
the
commission's
report.
and
i
believe
you
will
be
satisfied
about
that.
mr.
trienens
talked
about
car
costs.
they
said
that
they
wanted
to
get
the
cost
closer
to
the
north-south
traffic.
and
what
do
you
suppose
they
offered
in
substitution
for
the
northern
and
southern
lines
cost,
on
car
cost?
they
used
the
average
car
cost
of
all
the
railroads
in
the
united
states.
and
the
commission
minutely
examined
that
and
said
no
that
that
wasn't
representative.
that
the
northern
and
southern
lines
own
cost
were
more
representative
of
the
car
cost
than
the
u.s.car
cost.
the
southern
line
said,
“the
car
cost
of
the
northern
and
southern
lines
are
not
representative
here
because
mostly
in
this
service
boxcars
are
use,
whereas
the
northern
and
southern
lines
have
more
open
hopper
cars.”
the
commission
analyzed
that,
and
it
found
that
it
cost
more
to
own
and
maintain
open
hoppers
than
boxcars.
so
to
that
extent,
the
territorial
cost
would
over
--
would
be
an
overstatement,
rather
than
an
understatement.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
they
also
said
that
there
was
a
difference
in
utilization.
the
commission
analyzed
that
and
found
that
that
wasn't
a
factor.
the
commission
said,
“it
is
known
what
the
facts
--
what
factors
caused
the
northern
lines
to
have
higher
car
cost
than
southern.”
in
the
first
place,
northern
lines
have
more
--
have
higher
wages,
pay
higher
wage
rates
than
southern
lines.
they
said
the
northern
lines
pay
higher
taxes
than
southern
lines
and
that
overall
there
is
a
greater
utilization
in
the
south
than
in
the
north.
i
think
we
pretty
adequately
covered
that
on
our
brief.
your
honors,
in
the
transcontinental
case
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
let
me
answer
by
reference
to
a
decision
of
the
commission.
i
wanted
to
get
to
that
point.
our
friends
on
the
other
side
have
said
that
the
rates
are
equal.
they're
talking
only
about
class
rates.
class
rates
boom
only
1%
of
the
traffic.
the
commission
said
in
the
cases
cited
on
page
14
of
our
reply
brief,
“rate
levels
within
the
north
have
become
higher
than
within
the
south.”
and
they
said
that
in
a
case
back
in
'56,
and
we've
shown
that
since
that
time
in
general
freight
rate
increase
cases,
the
commission
has
allowed
even
greater
increases
within
the
north
and
from
and
to
the
north
that
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
no
your
honor.
the
increases
are
generally
the
same,
but
they
are
imposed
on
higher
base
wages
than
the
south.
i
submit
your
honors
that
this
case
really
could
be
controlled
by
the
cnnw
case.
to
all
intents
and
purposes,
the
questions
on
these
costs
issues
are
the
same.
thank
you.
