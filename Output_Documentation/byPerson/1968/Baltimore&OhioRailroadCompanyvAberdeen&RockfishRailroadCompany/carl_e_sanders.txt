mr.
carl
e.
sanders
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
carl
sanders.
i
represent
the
southern
governor's
conference.
i
represent
the
southeastern
association
of
railroad
and
utility
commissioners.
i
come
to
the
court
with
a
little
different
version,
a
little
different
view
of
what
this
case
is
all
about.
of
course,
i
have
two.
we've
been
in
this
case
since
the
very
beginning,
and
we've
had
to
listen
to
the
arguments
between
the
northern
and
southern
railroads,
and
we've
heard
all
of
these
evidence
about
the
question
of
cost.
but
we
contend
and
we
respectfully
insist
today
that
this
not
just
a
private
dispute
over
revenue
between
northern
and
southern
railroads,
but
that
this
case
involves
a
much
bigger
question,
and
that
this
case
really
involves
the
fact
that
the
commission
has
abandoned
the
territorial
relationship
of
equality
between
the
north
and
the
south.
and
they've
done
this
without
any
explanation
whatsoever
so
far
as
we've
been
able
to
ascertain.
this
is
--
sir?
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
equality
of
--
that
they
are
differences
this
court
in
1947
in
new
york
versus
unites
states
determined
that
they
were
no
differences
between
the
official
territory
of
the
north
and
the
southern
territory,
and
by
virtue
of
that,
you
established
the
uniformity
of
rates
and
then
subsequent
to
that,
the
uniformity
of
divisions.
we
have
been
in
this
case.
it's
been
our
observation
that
there
has
been
no
determination,
no
reasons
given.
no
adequate
reasons
given
why
the
decision
in
the
new
york
versus
united
states
case
is
not
just
as
sound
today
as
it
was
in
1947.
and
that
this
business
about
it
being
costing
more
money
to
run
the
railroads
in
the
north
as
compared
with
running
a
railroad
in
the
south
is
not
based
on
any
inherent
difference,
which
is
the
words
that
this
court
used
when
it
became
necessary
to
just
divisions
or
just
rates
that
they
should
be
some
inherent
difference.
and
so,
you
put
us
on
an
equal
basis,
and
we've
been
on
that
equal
basis
and
we
see
no
reason
under
the
evidence
that
was
submitted
before
the
commission.
we
see
no
reason
to
change
this
basis
and
give
the
north
now
a
preference
in
divisions
for
operating
railroads
in
the
north
when
they
have
not
proven
to
anybody
satisfaction
that
it
cost
any
more
money
to
operate
a
railroad
in
the
north
and
it
does
in
the
south
today.
if
your
honor
please,
it's
of
course,
it
is
inflation
matter,
and
what
it
amounts
to
is
this,
it
simply
amounts
to
the
fact
that
under
this
order
of
the
commission,
they
are
going
to
give
them
an
average
of
17%
more,
up
to
a
maximum
of
34%
more,
but
carrying
the
same
amount
of
freight
over
the
same
distance
in
the
north
as
it
relates
to
the
south.
and
that's
what
it
amounts
to.
now,
--
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
17%,
that's
a
net
average
change
in
the
amount
of
money
we
cost
the
southern
railroads.
i
think
is
what
--
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
--
mr.
kaier
said,
but
the
division
preference
that
they
are
giving
in
this
case
is
an
average
of
17%
more
to
the
northern
railroad
for
carrying
--
if
you
got
a
whole
of
50
miles
in
the
north
and
we've
got
an
identical
whole
of
50
miles
in
the
south,
they
are
going
to
give
them
an
average
of
17%
more
in
the
north
for
carrying
that
same
amount
of
traffic
over
that
same
distance
as
we
would
get
for
carrying
the
same
amount
of
traffic
over
the
same
distance
in
the
south.
and
it
does
go
as
high
as
34%
in
the
record.
and
so,
this
is
not
something
new
from
--
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
the
3%
that
they're
talking
about
is
the
amount
of
money
that
is
going
to
take
away
from
the
southern
railroads
operating
revenues.
i
believe
it's
the
correct
interpretation
of
that.
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
all
right
sir.
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
the
theory,
if
there
is
a
theory,
is
that
they
say
that
there
is
a
difference.
they
say
there's
--
it
cost
more
money
to
operate
a
railroad
in
the
north.
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
they
don't
give
any
reasons.
this
is
our
point.
this
is
what
the
southern
governor's
conference
and
the
southeast
railroad
commissions
are
complaining
about.
we
say
that
if
they
made
a
finding
that
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
they've
got
to
give
the
reason
for
the
finding.
and
we
say
that
if
there
is
a
finding,
they've
got
to
have
evidence
to
support
that
finding.
now,
i
can
quote
what
they
have
said
in
this
case.
the
icc
said
this,
this
is
from
the
record,
“other
factors
being
equal,
the
cost
differences
between
the
north
and
the
south
are
the
product
of
and
reflect
inherent
advantages
and
disadvantages
in
the
two
territories.”
now,
this
is
what
they
said.
we
contend
it
of
course
--
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
sir?
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
well,
they
claim
that
the
north
has
the
greatest
disadvantage
may
it
please
mr.
justice
and
--
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
the
only
disadvantage
that
we
can
ascertain
from
this
record
is
one,
perhaps
an
over
capacity
of
railroad
facility
in
the
north.
we
think
that
if
there's
any
cost
difference
between
operating
a
railroad
in
the
north
today
as
compared
with
this
operating
one
in
the
south
from
this
record,
it
would
be
because
they've
got
more
capacity
in
the
north
than
we
have
in
the
south.
and
of
course,
they
did
not
--
they
recognize
--
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
no
sir,
i
mean
that
back
in
the
day
and
times
when
the
northern
railroad
system
was
first
built,
to
be
perfectly
candid
about
it,
all
industry
in
this
country
was
located
in
the
northern
part
of
the
country.
and
at
that
time
of
course,
there
was
a
great
deal
of
railroads
that
were
built.
since
that
time,
of
course,
much
of
the
industry
in
this
country,
some
of
it
thank
goodness,
has
come
to
the
south.
and
now
the
fact
that
we
do
have
industry
in
the
south,
we
have
an
overcapacity
of
railroads
in
the
north.
and
so
they
say,
well
as
a
result
of
that
they've
got
maybe
more
wages.
they've
got
perhaps
some
of
these
transitory
costs
that
are
tendered
to
operating
an
oversized
railroad.
now,
since
that
time,
since
this
decision
and
they
recognize
this
in
the
commission
but
they
didn't
do
anything
about
it.
they
said
“we
raise
the
question
what's
going
to
happen
when
they
have
these
merges?”
and
they
said,
“we
can't
go
into
merges.
we
can't
consider
that
other
than
to
recognize
that
there
are
going
to
be
merges.”
and
since
that
time
in
the
pan
central
merger
case,
the
commission
found
that
the
pan
central
merger
would
save
$80
million
a
year.
and
yet
there's
not
any
recognition
given
whatsoever
in
this
proceeding
for
these
savings
that
are
taking
place
in
the
north.
what
we
are
trying
to
do,
mr.
justice
douglas
in
his
opinion
in
new
york
versus
united
states
said
that
of
all
things
that
we
don't
want
to
happen
is
that
we
don't
want
to
create
a
manmade
trade
barrier.
and
if
we
are
going
to
have
a
manmade
trade
barrier
as
the
rate
structure
then
existed,
and
so
we're
going
to
equalize
the
rates
and
at
the
same
time
they
equalize
the
divisions.
now
what
this
northern
railroads'
are
asking
this
court
to
do
now
in
a
subtle
fashion
is
to
re-impose
in
another
manner
the
same
manmade
trade
barrier
between
the
north
and
the
south,
except
instead
of
doing
it
through
the
structure
of
rates.
they
are
now
asking
you
to
do
it
through
preferences
and
divisions.
and
it
creates
the
same
problem
that
we
had
25
years
ago.
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
the
difference
in
consequences
is
that
if
you
allow
this
situation
to
stand
as
it
stands
now
with
the
preference
in
division,
the
difference
in
consequence
is
this.
first
of
all,
we
are
going
to
have
to
pay
for
this
inflation.
it's
going
to
come
out
of
the
hide
of
the
southern
shipper.
it's
going
to
come
out
of
the
hide
of
the
southern
economy.
it's
going
to
come
out
at
one
fashion
or
another.
we
can't
operate
railroads
in
the
south
and
give
the
north
17%
more
for
that
same
traffic.
so
we
either
going
to
have
to
raise
the
rates
in
the
south.
that
means
that
the
southern
rate
goes
back
up
and
we
have
a
rate
in
the
south
that's
greater
than
the
north.
o,
if
we
don't
raise
the
rate
in
the
south,
we're
going
to
have
to
reduce
the
service.
and
that
means
that
instead
of
being
able
to
provide
the
same
service
that
you
can
get
in
the
north
that
instead
of
being
able
to
buy
say
with
the
amount
of
money
that's
involved
in
this
case,
we
can
buy
several
hundred
freight
cars
in
the
south
for
these
railroads
that
are
operating
in
the
south.
but
if
this
commission
order
is
allowed
to
stand,
that
means
that
these
freight
cars
that
we
could
buy
and
be
using
in
the
south,
they're
going
to
be
using
them
in
the
north.
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
we're
talking
about
3%,
i
believe.
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
20%.
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
20%,
mr.
justice.
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
yes
sir.
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
yes
sir,
i
sure
am.
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
yes
sir.
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
yes
sir.
and
i
think
if
may
it
please
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
if
this
court
will
affirm
the
other
point
that
i'm
seeking.
and
i
want
to
conclude
my
argument,
but
this
court
will
affirm
the
district
judge's
decision.
all
we
want
and
all
we've
ever
asked
for,
and
we've
raised
the
question
at
every
level
from
the
beginning
up,
is
to
ask
the
commission
to
go
in
to
all
of
the
economic
facets
and
all
of
the
economic
factors
in
the
northern
territory
and
in
the
south.
and
if
they
go
in
to
all
of
those
factors,
which
they
did
not
do
in
this
case,
then
we
are
perfectly
willing
to
stand
by
whatever
the
decision
might
be.
but
we
have
never
been
--
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
no
sir.
we
would
like
--
we
believe
it
will
come
out
right.
the
other
point
i
want
to
make
before
i
sit
down,
if
might.
and
this
is
the
other
thing
that
the
commission
is
doing
in
this
case
that
i
think
is
very
significant
is
that
for
30
odd
years,
they
have
followed
the
principle
of
primary
local
responsibility.
and
that
is
that
the
territory
where
the
cost
factor
is
involved
should
bear
the
course
to
that
territory,
not
super
impose
it
on
some
other
territory.
and
what
they're
asking
us
to
do
in
the
south
is
subsidize
the
northern
railroads.
and
one
other
factor
and
i
will
sit
down
because
my
time
is
up
and
i
know
mr.
trienens
is
a
much
better
lawyer
than
i
ever
hope
to
argue
this
case.
but
the
other
factor
is
these
commuter
deficits.
now,
you
gentlemen
know,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
the
south
has
come
a
long
way
in
the
last
20
years.
you
also
know
that
according
to
every
economic
indicator
in
this
country
today,
we
are
still
below
any
other
section
of
the
country
regardless
of
the
progress
that
we
have
made.
they
have
settled
us,
the
commission
has
in
this
case,
with
commuter
deficits
in
the
north,
which
have
no
relationship
whatsoever
to
us
in
the
south
at
this
time.
however,
i
happen
to
have
the
privilege
this
month
of
heading
up
a
committee
in
atlanta,
georgia
to
go
to
the
people
in
metropolitan
atlanta
for
a
$433
million
bond
issue,
nothing
to
do
with
the
railroads
now,
$433
million
bond
issue
for
rapid
transit.
and
we
are
coming
to
grips
with
that
problem
because
we
know
we
have
to
come
to
grips
with
that
problem,
and
we
don't
think
that
we
should
have
to
subsidize
the
commuter
deficits
in
the
north,
and
at
the
same
time
come
to
grips
with
the
problem
ourselves
in
the
south
and
pay
that
ourselves.
we
simply,
in
conclusion,
we
simply
feel
this
way.
we
want
equal
treatment
with
all
sections
of
the
country.
we
want
a
free
economy
unhampered
by
any
manmade
trade
barriers.
and
certainly
if
we
think
we
are
entitled
to
equality
of
equal
treatment
with
any
other
section
of
the
country,
and
certainly
if
we
are
going
to
receive
less
than
that,
we
think
that
the
commission
should
at
least
give
us
some
explanation
while
we
are
going
to
have
to
be
relegated
to
a
second
class
status.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
carl
sanders.
i
represent
the
southern
governor's
conference.
i
represent
the
southeastern
association
of
railroad
and
utility
commissioners.
i
come
to
the
court
with
a
little
different
version,
a
little
different
view
of
what
this
case
is
all
about.
of
course,
i
have
two.
we've
been
in
this
case
since
the
very
beginning,
and
we've
had
to
listen
to
the
arguments
between
the
northern
and
southern
railroads,
and
we've
heard
all
of
these
evidence
about
the
question
of
cost.
but
we
contend
and
we
respectfully
insist
today
that
this
not
just
a
private
dispute
over
revenue
between
northern
and
southern
railroads,
but
that
this
case
involves
a
much
bigger
question,
and
that
this
case
really
involves
the
fact
that
the
commission
has
abandoned
the
territorial
relationship
of
equality
between
the
north
and
the
south.
and
they've
done
this
without
any
explanation
whatsoever
so
far
as
we've
been
able
to
ascertain.
this
is
--
sir?
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
equality
of
--
that
they
are
differences
this
court
in
1947
in
new
york
versus
unites
states
determined
that
they
were
no
differences
between
the
official
territory
of
the
north
and
the
southern
territory,
and
by
virtue
of
that,
you
established
the
uniformity
of
rates
and
then
subsequent
to
that,
the
uniformity
of
divisions.
we
have
been
in
this
case.
it's
been
our
observation
that
there
has
been
no
determination,
no
reasons
given.
no
adequate
reasons
given
why
the
decision
in
the
new
york
versus
united
states
case
is
not
just
as
sound
today
as
it
was
in
1947.
and
that
this
business
about
it
being
costing
more
money
to
run
the
railroads
in
the
north
as
compared
with
running
a
railroad
in
the
south
is
not
based
on
any
inherent
difference,
which
is
the
words
that
this
court
used
when
it
became
necessary
to
just
divisions
or
just
rates
that
they
should
be
some
inherent
difference.
and
so,
you
put
us
on
an
equal
basis,
and
we've
been
on
that
equal
basis
and
we
see
no
reason
under
the
evidence
that
was
submitted
before
the
commission.
we
see
no
reason
to
change
this
basis
and
give
the
north
now
a
preference
in
divisions
for
operating
railroads
in
the
north
when
they
have
not
proven
to
anybody
satisfaction
that
it
cost
any
more
money
to
operate
a
railroad
in
the
north
and
it
does
in
the
south
today.
if
your
honor
please,
it's
of
course,
it
is
inflation
matter,
and
what
it
amounts
to
is
this,
it
simply
amounts
to
the
fact
that
under
this
order
of
the
commission,
they
are
going
to
give
them
an
average
of
17%
more,
up
to
a
maximum
of
34%
more,
but
carrying
the
same
amount
of
freight
over
the
same
distance
in
the
north
as
it
relates
to
the
south.
and
that's
what
it
amounts
to.
now,
--
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
17%,
that's
a
net
average
change
in
the
amount
of
money
we
cost
the
southern
railroads.
i
think
is
what
--
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
--
mr.
kaier
said,
but
the
division
preference
that
they
are
giving
in
this
case
is
an
average
of
17%
more
to
the
northern
railroad
for
carrying
--
if
you
got
a
whole
of
50
miles
in
the
north
and
we've
got
an
identical
whole
of
50
miles
in
the
south,
they
are
going
to
give
them
an
average
of
17%
more
in
the
north
for
carrying
that
same
amount
of
traffic
over
that
same
distance
as
we
would
get
for
carrying
the
same
amount
of
traffic
over
the
same
distance
in
the
south.
and
it
does
go
as
high
as
34%
in
the
record.
and
so,
this
is
not
something
new
from
--
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
the
3%
that
they're
talking
about
is
the
amount
of
money
that
is
going
to
take
away
from
the
southern
railroads
operating
revenues.
i
believe
it's
the
correct
interpretation
of
that.
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
all
right
sir.
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
the
theory,
if
there
is
a
theory,
is
that
they
say
that
there
is
a
difference.
they
say
there's
--
it
cost
more
money
to
operate
a
railroad
in
the
north.
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
they
don't
give
any
reasons.
this
is
our
point.
this
is
what
the
southern
governor's
conference
and
the
southeast
railroad
commissions
are
complaining
about.
we
say
that
if
they
made
a
finding
that
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
they've
got
to
give
the
reason
for
the
finding.
and
we
say
that
if
there
is
a
finding,
they've
got
to
have
evidence
to
support
that
finding.
now,
i
can
quote
what
they
have
said
in
this
case.
the
icc
said
this,
this
is
from
the
record,
“other
factors
being
equal,
the
cost
differences
between
the
north
and
the
south
are
the
product
of
and
reflect
inherent
advantages
and
disadvantages
in
the
two
territories.”
now,
this
is
what
they
said.
we
contend
it
of
course
--
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
sir?
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
well,
they
claim
that
the
north
has
the
greatest
disadvantage
may
it
please
mr.
justice
and
--
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
the
only
disadvantage
that
we
can
ascertain
from
this
record
is
one,
perhaps
an
over
capacity
of
railroad
facility
in
the
north.
we
think
that
if
there's
any
cost
difference
between
operating
a
railroad
in
the
north
today
as
compared
with
this
operating
one
in
the
south
from
this
record,
it
would
be
because
they've
got
more
capacity
in
the
north
than
we
have
in
the
south.
and
of
course,
they
did
not
--
they
recognize
--
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
no
sir,
i
mean
that
back
in
the
day
and
times
when
the
northern
railroad
system
was
first
built,
to
be
perfectly
candid
about
it,
all
industry
in
this
country
was
located
in
the
northern
part
of
the
country.
and
at
that
time
of
course,
there
was
a
great
deal
of
railroads
that
were
built.
since
that
time,
of
course,
much
of
the
industry
in
this
country,
some
of
it
thank
goodness,
has
come
to
the
south.
and
now
the
fact
that
we
do
have
industry
in
the
south,
we
have
an
overcapacity
of
railroads
in
the
north.
and
so
they
say,
well
as
a
result
of
that
they've
got
maybe
more
wages.
they've
got
perhaps
some
of
these
transitory
costs
that
are
tendered
to
operating
an
oversized
railroad.
now,
since
that
time,
since
this
decision
and
they
recognize
this
in
the
commission
but
they
didn't
do
anything
about
it.
they
said
“we
raise
the
question
what's
going
to
happen
when
they
have
these
merges?”
and
they
said,
“we
can't
go
into
merges.
we
can't
consider
that
other
than
to
recognize
that
there
are
going
to
be
merges.”
and
since
that
time
in
the
pan
central
merger
case,
the
commission
found
that
the
pan
central
merger
would
save
$80
million
a
year.
and
yet
there's
not
any
recognition
given
whatsoever
in
this
proceeding
for
these
savings
that
are
taking
place
in
the
north.
what
we
are
trying
to
do,
mr.
justice
douglas
in
his
opinion
in
new
york
versus
united
states
said
that
of
all
things
that
we
don't
want
to
happen
is
that
we
don't
want
to
create
a
manmade
trade
barrier.
and
if
we
are
going
to
have
a
manmade
trade
barrier
as
the
rate
structure
then
existed,
and
so
we're
going
to
equalize
the
rates
and
at
the
same
time
they
equalize
the
divisions.
now
what
this
northern
railroads'
are
asking
this
court
to
do
now
in
a
subtle
fashion
is
to
re-impose
in
another
manner
the
same
manmade
trade
barrier
between
the
north
and
the
south,
except
instead
of
doing
it
through
the
structure
of
rates.
they
are
now
asking
you
to
do
it
through
preferences
and
divisions.
and
it
creates
the
same
problem
that
we
had
25
years
ago.
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
the
difference
in
consequences
is
that
if
you
allow
this
situation
to
stand
as
it
stands
now
with
the
preference
in
division,
the
difference
in
consequence
is
this.
first
of
all,
we
are
going
to
have
to
pay
for
this
inflation.
it's
going
to
come
out
of
the
hide
of
the
southern
shipper.
it's
going
to
come
out
of
the
hide
of
the
southern
economy.
it's
going
to
come
out
at
one
fashion
or
another.
we
can't
operate
railroads
in
the
south
and
give
the
north
17%
more
for
that
same
traffic.
so
we
either
going
to
have
to
raise
the
rates
in
the
south.
that
means
that
the
southern
rate
goes
back
up
and
we
have
a
rate
in
the
south
that's
greater
than
the
north.
o,
if
we
don't
raise
the
rate
in
the
south,
we're
going
to
have
to
reduce
the
service.
and
that
means
that
instead
of
being
able
to
provide
the
same
service
that
you
can
get
in
the
north
that
instead
of
being
able
to
buy
say
with
the
amount
of
money
that's
involved
in
this
case,
we
can
buy
several
hundred
freight
cars
in
the
south
for
these
railroads
that
are
operating
in
the
south.
but
if
this
commission
order
is
allowed
to
stand,
that
means
that
these
freight
cars
that
we
could
buy
and
be
using
in
the
south,
they're
going
to
be
using
them
in
the
north.
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
we're
talking
about
3%,
i
believe.
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
20%.
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
20%,
mr.
justice.
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
yes
sir.
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
yes
sir,
i
sure
am.
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
yes
sir.
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
yes
sir.
and
i
think
if
may
it
please
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
if
this
court
will
affirm
the
other
point
that
i'm
seeking.
and
i
want
to
conclude
my
argument,
but
this
court
will
affirm
the
district
judge's
decision.
all
we
want
and
all
we've
ever
asked
for,
and
we've
raised
the
question
at
every
level
from
the
beginning
up,
is
to
ask
the
commission
to
go
in
to
all
of
the
economic
facets
and
all
of
the
economic
factors
in
the
northern
territory
and
in
the
south.
and
if
they
go
in
to
all
of
those
factors,
which
they
did
not
do
in
this
case,
then
we
are
perfectly
willing
to
stand
by
whatever
the
decision
might
be.
but
we
have
never
been
--
mr.
carl
e.
sanders
no
sir.
we
would
like
--
we
believe
it
will
come
out
right.
the
other
point
i
want
to
make
before
i
sit
down,
if
might.
and
this
is
the
other
thing
that
the
commission
is
doing
in
this
case
that
i
think
is
very
significant
is
that
for
30
odd
years,
they
have
followed
the
principle
of
primary
local
responsibility.
and
that
is
that
the
territory
where
the
cost
factor
is
involved
should
bear
the
course
to
that
territory,
not
super
impose
it
on
some
other
territory.
and
what
they're
asking
us
to
do
in
the
south
is
subsidize
the
northern
railroads.
and
one
other
factor
and
i
will
sit
down
because
my
time
is
up
and
i
know
mr.
trienens
is
a
much
better
lawyer
than
i
ever
hope
to
argue
this
case.
but
the
other
factor
is
these
commuter
deficits.
now,
you
gentlemen
know,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
the
south
has
come
a
long
way
in
the
last
20
years.
you
also
know
that
according
to
every
economic
indicator
in
this
country
today,
we
are
still
below
any
other
section
of
the
country
regardless
of
the
progress
that
we
have
made.
they
have
settled
us,
the
commission
has
in
this
case,
with
commuter
deficits
in
the
north,
which
have
no
relationship
whatsoever
to
us
in
the
south
at
this
time.
however,
i
happen
to
have
the
privilege
this
month
of
heading
up
a
committee
in
atlanta,
georgia
to
go
to
the
people
in
metropolitan
atlanta
for
a
$433
million
bond
issue,
nothing
to
do
with
the
railroads
now,
$433
million
bond
issue
for
rapid
transit.
and
we
are
coming
to
grips
with
that
problem
because
we
know
we
have
to
come
to
grips
with
that
problem,
and
we
don't
think
that
we
should
have
to
subsidize
the
commuter
deficits
in
the
north,
and
at
the
same
time
come
to
grips
with
the
problem
ourselves
in
the
south
and
pay
that
ourselves.
we
simply,
in
conclusion,
we
simply
feel
this
way.
we
want
equal
treatment
with
all
sections
of
the
country.
we
want
a
free
economy
unhampered
by
any
manmade
trade
barriers.
and
certainly
if
we
think
we
are
entitled
to
equality
of
equal
treatment
with
any
other
section
of
the
country,
and
certainly
if
we
are
going
to
receive
less
than
that,
we
think
that
the
commission
should
at
least
give
us
some
explanation
while
we
are
going
to
have
to
be
relegated
to
a
second
class
status.
thank
you
very
much.
