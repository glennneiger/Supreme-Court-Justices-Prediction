mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
if
it
please
the
court,
my
name
is
arthur
cerra
and
i'm
an
assistant
associate
general
counsel
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
these
appeals
present
a
question
of
major
importance
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
section
156
duty
to
ensure
just
reasonable
and
equal
divisions
as
between
connecting
rail
carriers.
now,
as
mr.
kaier's
indicated,
district
court
held
that
rail
form
a
territorial
cost
not
a
proper
yardstick
for
measuring
north-south
traffic,
and
that
the
commission
was
required
to
produce
more
refine
data
to
ascertain
the
actual
cost
of
that
service.
in
reaching
that
conclusion,
the
court
below
disregarded
key
determinations
made
by
the
commission.
first,
they
disregarded
first
in
rejecting
the
commission's
comprehences
of
analysis
of
rail
form
a,
and
its
application
to
all
the
units
of
service
that
were
rendered
in
north-south
traffic,
and
these
units
are
service
being
the
ones
that
comprise
what
is
being
measured.
the
district
court
paid
little
attention
to
these
findings
and
analysis
of
the
commission.
and
secondly,
the
court
disregarded
the
findings
made
by
the
commission
after
its
review
of
all
the
evidence
submitted
by
the
parties
that
this
cost
reliably
and
accurately
reflect
the
traffic
in
question.
now,
those
findings
were
based
on
evidence
that
the
traffic
moves
over
all
railroads
and
between
all
stations
in
both
territories,
and
it's
not
handled
as
a
distinct
entity
at
all,
but
rather,
it's
average
traffic
handled
as
an
indiscriminate
part
of
all
traffic
and
it
possesses
no
distinguishing
characteristics.
now,
this
court
observed
in
the
cnnw
case
that
the
ascertainment
of
cost
and
the
treatment
of
accounting
problems
concern
factual
matters
relating
entirely
to
the
--
and
directly
pertaining
--
excuse
me,
relating
entirely
to
the
special
and
complex
matters
of
the
railroad
industry.
the
court
had
no
familiar
--
the
court
below
had
no
familiarity
with
these
problems
and
either
sought
here
to
obtain
more
accuracy
or
to
restrict
the
consideration
that
the
commission
could
give
to
these
matters
solely
to
the
cost
directly
pertaining
to
the
traffic
in
question.
we
believe
that
such
an
effort
to
achieve
a
theoretically
perfect
cost
formula
really
does
constitute
an
unwarranted
incursion
into
the
administrative
domain.
and
for
this
reason,
railroads
are
multi-purpose
facilities.
they
produce
a
number
of
transportation
services
for
the
common
use
of
physical
facilities
and
employee
services.
now,
how
do
we
obtain
the
cost
for
these
services?
when
there
are
direct
cost,
we
can
allocate
them
to
the
traffic.
when
there
are
not
direct
cost,
they
are
common
cost,
there
have
to
be
some
kind
of
judgment,
empirical
judgments
made
on
determining
how
to
allocate
this,
or
how
is
it
done.
it's
done
on
the
revenue
basis.
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
between
different
kinds
of
traffic
of
railroads
mr.
justice
black,
for
example,
a
car
of
north-south
traffic
might
travel
in
the
train
with
traffic
from
various
other
areas
of
the
country
when
it
reaches
the
border.
the
same
engine
is
used.
the
same
fuel
is
used.
the
same
switching
crews.
how
do
you
allocate
the
cost
running
that
train
between
the
traffics?
well,
you
allocate
it
on
the
basis
of
the
revenue
used
that
it
produces.
you
find
out
what
the
costs
are,
and
each
traffic
bears
that
portion
of
those
cost.
that's
what
the
commission
did
in
this
case.
as
i
was
saying,
where
a
railroad
--
as
all
these
railroads
are
a
multi-purpose
facilities
and
they
produce
a
number
of
transportation
services.
when
we
try
to
ascertain
whereas
here,
if
any
given
body
a
traffic
uses
physical
facilities
in
common
and
employee
services
in
common
with
other
traffic,
and
it's
been
shown
that
it
has
not
distinguishing
characteristics
from
any
other
type
of
traffic,
it
would
appear
to
us
that
the
application
of
rail
form
a
cost
is
plainly
proper.
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
i
didn't
quite
understand
your
question,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
we
do,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
mr.
justice
fortas,
this
is
precisely
what
the
commission
did
here.
this
traffic
we
shown
to
be
not
distinguishable
in
any
characteristic
from
any
other
traffic
that
the
railroad
handles.
now,
that
being
solely
--
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
well,
the
question
i
would
have
to
ask
in
that,
how
do
we
get
these
cost
your
honor?
we
would
have
to
get
this
cost
by
starting
out
with
rail
form
a.
starting
out
with
rail
form
a
and
trying
to
make
a
segregation
of
all
the
services
that
were
performed
on
north-south
traffic.
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
and
that's
precisely
what
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
but
the
aggregate
cost
your
honor
are
all
the
services
that
are
performed
by
the
railroad
to
provide
all
the
work
units
in
expenses
that
takes
to
provide
any
amount
of
traffic
that
the
railroads
handle.
and
when
you
throw
this
all
in
one
pool
and
they're
using
common
facilities,
a
unit
cost
for
each
type
of
service,
then
you
go
to
the
railroad's
traffic
study
for
a
year
which
shows
all
the
services
units
that
were
rendered
in
performing
north-south
traffic,
and
you
multiply
those
unit
cost
of
service
against
the
revenue
units,
and
you
come
out
with
the
cost
for
the
traffic.
that
is
what
the
commission
did
here.
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
the
standards
that
it
would
present
arise
from
the
problem
that
here,
the
commission
used
fully
distributed
cost.
now
in
the
cnnw
case,
they
used
out
of
pocket
cost.
they
didn't
consider
any
of
these
overhead
items
and
distributed
as
to
that
traffic.
so
the
distinguishing
feature
here
is
that
the
commission
used
fully
distributed
cost.
now
--
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
should
it?
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
and
this
is
the
determination
of
cost
which
depends
on
policy.
the
commission
has
formulated
a
policy
of
saying
following
this
court's
decision
in
north
dakota
in
1915,
the
north
dakota
case
we
cited
in
our
brief
that
when
cost
are
being
considered,
the
commission
must
not
only
ascertain
the
cost
directly
pertaining
to
the
service,
but
it
also
must
ascertain
in
a
portion
those
causes
which
are
joint
or
not
directly
pertaining
to
it.
and
every
railroad
has
certain
overhead
expenses.
now,
if
we
have
these
overhead
expenses
and
we're
going
to
say
that
it
should
not
be
portioned
on
a
revenue
unit
basis
between
all
given
bodies
of
traffic,
we're
going
to
find
out
that
sooner
or
later,
the
railroads
are
not
being
able
to
recouped
this
overhead
expenses
from
anybody
of
traffic.
so
as
a
policy
matter,
the
commission
has
said
here
fully
distributed
cost,
meaning
an
apportionment
of
all
overhead
burdens
must
be
divided
and
that
part
will
be
divided
here
in
accordance
that
this
north-south
traffic
bears
to
the
total
traffic
of
both
groups
of
railroads.
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
j.
cerra
your
honor,
the
refinement
we
made
based
on
the
rail
form
a
computations
and
based
on
the
fact
that
parties
who
seek
to
show
that
there
are
differences
in
one
given
body
of
traffic
as
compared
to
average
traffic
were
shown
here.
the
commission
reviewed
the
attempts
by
the
southern
lines
to
show
these
bodies
of
traffic
do
distinguishing
from
average
traffic,
and
they
rejected
seven
and
accepted
five.
so,
--
that
means
i'm
through.
i'm
sorry
your
honors.
i
did
want
to
cover
just
quickly
the
point
of
the
southern
governor's
conference.
they
parrot
the
arguments
of
the
southern
lines,
but
they
claim
as
a
matter
of
law
that
even
if
the
northern
lines
experience
higher
cost
of
service,
the
commission
must
find
that
such
higher
cost
reflect
inherent
territorial
disadvantages
before
it
may
give
effect
to
such
cost
and
then
territorial
division's
case.
and
this
contention
is
based
on
the
premise
that
the
commission
made
no
adequate
findings
to
dispose
of
their
claim
and
therefore,
its
order
is
going
to
produce
dire
consequences
and
upon
the
economy
of
the
south
and
effectively
nullify
the
present
and
future
economic
gains
that
the
south
was
scheduled
to
receive
as
by
virtue
of
the
new
york
case.
well,
we
ask
the
court
only
to
consider
the
findings
that
the
commission
did
make
in
response
to
each
one
of
these
contentions,
and
the
findings
that
rejected
these
contentions
or
explain
why
the
commission
couldn't
accept
them
or
clearly
expressed
in
its
report.
we
don't
think
any
further
findings
are
required.

given
body
of
traffic
as
compared
to
average
traffic
were
shown
here.
the
commission
reviewed
the
attempts
by
the
southern
lines
to
show
these
bodies
of
traffic
do
distinguishing
from
average
traffic,
and
they
rejected
seven
and
accepted
five.
so,
--
that
means
i'm
through.
i'm
sorry
your
honors.
i
did
want
to
cover
just
quickly
the
point
of
the
southern
governor's
conference.
they
parrot
the
arguments
of
the
southern
lines,
but
they
claim
as
a
matter
of
law
that
even
if
the
northern
lines
experience
higher
cost
of
service,
the
commission
must
find
that
such
higher
cost
reflect
inherent
territorial
disadvantages
before
it
may
give
effect
to
such
cost
and
then
territorial
division's
case.
and
this
contention
is
based
on
the
premise
that
the
commission
made
no
adequate
findings
to
dispose
of
their
claim
and
therefore,
its
order
is
going
to
produce
dire
consequences
and
upon
the
economy
of
the
south
and
effectively
nullify
the
present
and
future
economic
gains
that
the
south
was
scheduled
to
receive
as
by
virtue
of
the
new
york
case.
well,
we
ask
the
court
only
to
consider
the
findings
that
the
commission
did
make
in
response
to
each
one
of
these
contentions,
and
the
findings
that
rejected
these
contentions
or
explain
why
the
commission
couldn't
accept
them
or
clearly
expressed
in
its
report.
we
don't
think
any
further
findings
are
required.
